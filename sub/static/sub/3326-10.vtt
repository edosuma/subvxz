WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.078
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.295 --> 00:04.707
Say you're sorry
for leaving me to burn.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.913
If you can hear me,
I need you to give me a sign.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.210
Malia.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.887
My grandmother found Meredith.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.306
She was controlling me.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.260
He wasn't on my list.
He was a bad person.

00:51.636 --> 00:53.092
Get up, Lori.
Come on. Run!

00:53.596 --> 00:54.631
Run!

00:55.598 --> 00:56.553
Go!

01:20.957 --> 01:22.037
Wait, wait!

01:27.797 --> 01:29.207
Lori, stop!

02:05.543 --> 02:07.283
Brett...
Brett, what's happening?

02:07.503 --> 02:08.834
Close your eyes.

02:16.429 --> 02:17.589
Run!

03:21.369 --> 03:23.781
Kira found Brett.
They're fine but we've got to go.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.282
- More assassins?
- Maybe a lot more.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.827
Different than the ones who
just tried to set us on fire?

03:29.085 --> 03:30.666
I think so, yeah.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.356
How about I take you home?

03:55.027 --> 03:56.528
I'm not like you.

03:57.113 --> 03:59.604
- Not yet.
- I don't mean I'm not strong

03:59.824 --> 04:02.156
or I'm never gonna learn
how to be in control.

04:04.078 --> 04:05.864
I mean everything else.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.492
You and your friends
try to protect everyone.

04:08.708 --> 04:11.245
Have you been doing this
the whole time?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.792
I mean, how are you all still alive?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.167
Not all of us are.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.924
Let me at least take you home.

04:36.152 --> 04:38.188
I'm completely and totally fine.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.816
You completely and totally
have a concussion, Stiles.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.237
Lie back down.

04:42.408 --> 04:44.820
The doctor said
you're not leaving without a CT scan.

04:45.035 --> 04:48.163
- We still haven't paid for the last one.
- Oh, no, no, no.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.324
Meredith is at the station.

04:50.541 --> 04:54.033
Your dad said it could take some time
but he will get her to talk.

04:56.255 --> 04:59.042
Even if I let you go,
what would you do?

05:02.303 --> 05:03.509
Okay, fine.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.891
Can you do me one little favor?
- Anything.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.843
Can you get me a tape player?

05:13.063 --> 05:15.019
- Like cassettes?
- Yes. Tapes.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.189
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

05:19.028 --> 05:20.984
Okay, tapes, though, please.

05:21.197 --> 05:22.277
Cassettes.

05:42.927 --> 05:44.337
- What did she say?
- Hard to tell.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.885
There were words. I'm not sure
there were actual sentences.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.223
Nothing.

05:49.058 --> 05:51.014
I think we need a psychologist...

05:51.227 --> 05:52.262
Or a medium.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.552
Is she even competent enough
to be charged with something?

05:56.816 --> 06:00.308
It Meredith is The Benefactor, then
that means she was competent enough

06:00.486 --> 06:02.397
to trick Kate
into opening the Hale Vault,

06:02.613 --> 06:04.820
competent enough to blackmail
Brunski into helping her,

06:05.032 --> 06:06.488
and competent enough
to create a hit list

06:06.700 --> 06:09.032
and pay out money for its completion.

06:09.245 --> 06:11.987
This girl's practically
a criminal mastermind.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.459
There's gotta be a reason
why she would do this.

06:18.671 --> 06:21.834
I'm only interested in the "why,"
if it tells me the "how."

06:22.049 --> 06:23.084
You mean how to stop it.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.586
After what happened
to Scott tonight, this thing's still going.

06:25.803 --> 06:27.339
The payments could be automatic.

06:27.513 --> 06:30.255
And as long as the killers are getting paid,
and paid very well,

06:30.474 --> 06:32.681
that list is gonna keep getting smaller.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.679
We don't just
need to stop the dead pool.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.427
We need to stop the money.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.947
- Is your mom...
- She's okay. Healing.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.414
- What about you?
- Me?

06:54.582 --> 06:55.822
Are you okay?

06:56.041 --> 06:57.872
Right now? Very.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.087
Did you find him?
Did you find Brett?

07:08.304 --> 07:10.590
Actually, I think I found all of them.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.175
Satomi,
this is who I was telling you about.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.180
I know who Scott McCall is.

07:22.860 --> 07:23.975
Are we safe here?

07:40.002 --> 07:41.458
We're gonna need help.

07:42.755 --> 07:43.961
A lot of help.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.948
I thought I told you to go home.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.157
I thought I told you
I wasn't going anywhere.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.293
Did they get anything out of her?

09:06.839 --> 09:08.795
Should have gone with the medium.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.751
We went through everything
in Brunski's office,

09:13.971 --> 09:16.838
and so far everything amounts to
pretty much nothing.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.388
Did you not go home yet?

09:18.559 --> 09:20.845
Not until Meredith starts talking.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.642
Lydia, I promise she'll talk,

09:22.855 --> 09:24.811
and when she does, I'll let you know.

09:25.024 --> 09:27.811
Trust me on this.
Everybody talks eventually.

09:28.027 --> 09:30.939
- Then let me try.
- No, we've already discussed this.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.862
I've gotten through
to her before. Just let me try.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.704
- You find a tape player?
- No.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.537
But I found someone looking for you.

09:54.553 --> 09:55.508
Hey.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.510
- I heard you almost got killed.
- I heard you almost got killed.

10:04.730 --> 10:05.685
You okay?

10:05.939 --> 10:09.227
Brunski punched me in the face.
Turns out he was a serial killer.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.188
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.564
What about you?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.945
We almost got set on fire.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.274
- Everyone okay?
- Basically.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.453
You okay?

10:25.751 --> 10:26.911
I'm fine.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.630
- I'm gonna go.
- You don't have to.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.416
- I should go.
- Okay.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.887
- It's locked.
- Why would she lock the door?

10:45.229 --> 10:47.515
Uh... Hey, Melissa?

10:48.857 --> 10:49.812
Melissa.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.390
- I could break it.
- How about you not?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.726
I already owe this hospital
enough money.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.485
Why would she lock the door?

10:57.032 --> 10:59.114
Maybe she didn't mean to.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.738
You don'tjust accidentally lock a door.

11:01.954 --> 11:04.741
Okay, well, maybe,
she wasn't thinking, exactly.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.242
Or wasn't thinking it through.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.666
You know, people sometimes do things
without thinking them through.

11:10.587 --> 11:11.747
Then she's stupid.

11:11.964 --> 11:15.081
No, even smart people
can do stupid things.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.677
You know, 'cause they think
that it's the right thing.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.298
And I don't think we should
hold it against her,

11:20.514 --> 11:22.220
you know, for the rest of her life!

11:23.350 --> 11:26.808
Especially because
she's tried apologizing

11:27.020 --> 11:30.183
hundreds of times through
texts and voicemails.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.809
Is she gonna keep begging?

11:32.151 --> 11:33.482
She might.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.771
I don't have much practice
in things like forgiveness.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.488
Some things I'm picking up fast.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.990
But other things are like...

11:43.704 --> 11:44.989
Like math?

11:46.290 --> 11:47.370
I hate math.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.660
You hate me?

11:51.879 --> 11:54.370
I like you, Stiles.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.551
I like you a lot.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.010
I can work with that.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.294
Wait! Wait!

13:25.514 --> 13:28.130
Brett! This is his place. It's his.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.595
Scott...

13:35.023 --> 13:37.935
If you bring in guests,
you could have called.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.935
I didn't have
anywhere else to take them.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.693
I know this man.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.820
He may not remember,
but we've met before.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.568
You can trust him.

13:50.789 --> 13:51.778
I trust him.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.283
How do we know
he's not like the others?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.367
- What others?
- Last night,

13:57.587 --> 13:59.669
there was
a whole team after them.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.504
And they used crossbows.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.211
They're hunters, aren't they?

14:08.724 --> 14:10.305
Not if they're killing for profit.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.475
- Not anymore.
- Can they find us?

14:14.271 --> 14:17.855
They might already know you're here.
Maybe they're waiting for dark.

14:18.442 --> 14:19.852
So we're not safe here?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.858
We're not safe anywhere.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.860
We've been trying to get out for days.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.649
Everywhere we turn,
we find someone new trying to kill us.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.950
If they're coming, Scott,

14:30.454 --> 14:33.287
they're coming for you too.
You're still number one on the dead pool.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.874
I know.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.869
I know Lydia can get
the answer from Meredith.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.534
She just needs more time.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.414
Then that's what she'll get.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.874
Let's go, Lorraine.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.880
Listen to me.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.211
Please listen.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.714
There's something I have to do,

14:49.348 --> 14:51.009
something I have to stop.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.768
l have to take you
back to Eichen, Lorraine.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.469
No. No. I don't think you're
gonna be taking me anywhere.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.311
I can hear the recorder
in your pocket.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.232
It's on now, isn't it?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.402
You're making a tape.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.027
Just like you taped the others.

15:10.285 --> 15:13.402
- This didn't happen at Eichen House.
- But then where did she go?

15:15.207 --> 15:16.993
That's what we need to find out.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.747
I think I'm getting
an idea of how all this happened.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.629
You used Brunski, right?

15:26.051 --> 15:27.757
You knew he'd killed people,

15:28.345 --> 15:29.835
and that he would do it again.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.931
He used my grandmother's code
for the dead pool.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.890
He put it online.

15:44.111 --> 15:48.104
He took the money from the Hale Vault,
then turned the bearer bonds into cash.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.947
He made the payments.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.539
Was it Brunski's idea
to fake your death?

15:57.791 --> 16:00.658
Did he get nervous because you
helped us with one of the cipher keys?

16:00.877 --> 16:02.333
I wanted to help.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.132
All you ever wanted to do was help.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.637
Is that why you're here?

16:14.850 --> 16:17.808
I know you wouldn't
want to be here if you didn't want to talk.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.303
I do.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.729
But only to one person.

16:27.696 --> 16:28.811
Who?

16:30.657 --> 16:31.863
Peter.

16:34.619 --> 16:35.779
Peter Hale.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.955
back to Eichen, Lorraine.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.504
No. No. I don't think you're
gonna be taking me anywhere.

16:47.716 --> 16:51.004
That's it. That's where it is.
Play it again and turn it up.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.674
- Eichen, Lorraine.
- No. No.

16:55.891 --> 16:58.507
I don't think you're
gonna be taking me anywhere.

16:59.728 --> 17:02.014
I can hear the recorder
in your pocket.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.640
It's on now, isn't it?

17:05.692 --> 17:06.977
You're making a tape.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.768
Just like you taped the others.

17:11.072 --> 17:12.608
It's the record player.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.652
What record player?

17:15.869 --> 17:17.825
The one in the lake house,
in the study.

17:18.038 --> 17:21.326
So she escaped from Eichen House
to go back to listen to a record player?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.827
Well, she was like Lydia, right?
She was a Banshee?

17:24.044 --> 17:26.000
Yeah, but only once.
She predicted Maddy's death

17:26.213 --> 17:29.171
and then just spent decades
trying to predict something else.

17:31.468 --> 17:32.708
Maybe she finally did.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.214
And what if this time,

17:35.430 --> 17:37.466
it wasn'tjust one death,
it was a lot of deaths?

17:39.434 --> 17:40.594
Like the dead pool.

17:43.063 --> 17:46.146
What if all those years ago,
Lorraine predicted it?

17:46.525 --> 17:49.392
And she knew there was
something in the study that could stop it?

17:50.028 --> 17:51.859
Then we're going to the lake house.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.387
They'll be okay.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.136
They've got claws and fangs.
But they're not fighters.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.063
That's why I called you.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.268
Well, try to remember I don't have
claws and fangs anymore either.

18:32.487 --> 18:33.693
That's why he called me.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.855
Am I the only one
still hoping this is all just a false alarm?

18:37.075 --> 18:39.817
I mean, it's possible we could wait here
all night and nothing happens.

18:40.036 --> 18:40.991
Right?

18:43.039 --> 18:44.825
Scott, you heard anything
from Stiles or Lydia yet?

18:45.041 --> 18:46.656
Lydia's still talking to Meredith.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.832
Stiles and Malia are
headed to the lake house.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.458
- They're trying to stop it.
- What if there is no stopping it?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.210
What if it doesn't end
until we're all dead?

19:00.181 --> 19:02.217
Then let's send a message.

19:02.434 --> 19:06.473
Let's make something perfectly clear to
anyone with a copy of that list.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.270
It doesn't matter
if they're professional assassins,

19:09.482 --> 19:12.770
hunters, or an amateur
who just picked up a gun.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.817
Anyone who thinks they can
hunt and kill us for money,

19:18.033 --> 19:20.945
is gonna be put on another list.
Our list.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.447
They get to be a name
on our dead pool.

19:32.756 --> 19:33.996
Her?

19:35.050 --> 19:37.541
That's the girl that stole my money?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.547
That girl is a Banshee.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.800
They're more dangerous than you think.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.927
Oh, I think that girl's
pilot light went out a long time ago.

19:45.810 --> 19:46.765
Sheriff, not to question

19:46.978 --> 19:48.934
the unquestionably
sterling reputation of your department,

19:49.147 --> 19:51.183
but are you absolutely sure

19:51.983 --> 19:53.359
you got the one?

19:53.568 --> 19:56.685
How about you just go in there
and see what she has to say?

20:00.283 --> 20:03.821
Okay... Meredith,

20:04.996 --> 20:06.577
where's my money?

20:09.042 --> 20:11.249
Or more correctly, what's left of it.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.383
Let her go.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.011
Let her go.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.982
Why did you do that?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.906
They're all gone.

20:49.666 --> 20:50.781
Oh, my God.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.835
They have met before.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.201
The burns.

20:57.048 --> 21:00.131
They're all gone.

21:09.060 --> 21:12.769
I remember meeting you,
but you weren't a Buddhist back then.

21:14.023 --> 21:17.857
And you weren't protecting werewolves.
You were hunting them.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.310
Three things cannot long be hidden...

21:21.239 --> 21:22.740
The sun.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.314
The moon.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.236
The truth.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.409
What exactly does that mean?

21:30.749 --> 21:32.865
The truth cannot stay hidden.

21:33.084 --> 21:36.121
I know what the saying means.
What does it mean for you?

21:37.589 --> 21:39.079
The truth for me

21:40.341 --> 21:41.797
is that we,

21:43.052 --> 21:44.383
my kind,

21:46.431 --> 21:48.012
are violent creatures,

21:48.641 --> 21:50.427
who eventually
will not be able to control

21:50.643 --> 21:52.554
their violent impulses.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.191
The mantra helps us
subdue our nature.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.399
But you're still violent creatures.

22:01.112 --> 22:02.818
Aren't we all?

22:05.366 --> 22:06.947
They're coming.

22:08.119 --> 22:09.575
Meredith, you put everyone,

22:09.788 --> 22:11.824
including my nephew and my daughter
on a death list.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.157
Don't you think you owe us
the slightest explanation of why?

22:16.419 --> 22:18.910
You said it had to be kept secret.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.168
I said?

22:24.302 --> 22:26.258
I said that to you?

22:27.430 --> 22:29.136
- You said it.
- Meredith.

22:29.349 --> 22:33.217
Allow me to remind you yet again,
we have never met...

22:34.020 --> 22:35.851
- Ever.
- What is he doing?

22:36.606 --> 22:38.096
You don't remember?

22:38.316 --> 22:40.557
No. But maybe you do.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.107
No, don't!

22:54.290 --> 22:55.279
Get back!

23:24.028 --> 23:25.734
Don't! Don't touch them.

23:25.947 --> 23:27.687
If you break the bond
you could kill them. Both of them.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.283
What are we supposed to do?

23:30.743 --> 23:31.994
|, uh...

23:32.787 --> 23:33.947
I don't know.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.708
What the hell is he doing to her?

23:56.811 --> 23:59.018
Patient has been non-responsive
for several weeks.

23:59.230 --> 24:02.563
No sign of physical trauma,
no response to external stimuli.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.027
Our feeling is the damage
is primarily psychological.

24:07.947 --> 24:08.982
Do you hear that?

24:09.490 --> 24:10.866
She's saying something.

24:12.035 --> 24:13.616
Can you understand that?

24:14.454 --> 24:15.569
I can.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.658
I can hear perfectly.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.294
She was in the hospital.

24:23.588 --> 24:24.998
The same hospital.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.875
Same as who?

24:28.676 --> 24:29.711
Peter.

24:29.928 --> 24:32.965
Here we have a rather extraordinary case.
Near fatal burn victim.

24:33.181 --> 24:36.423
The interesting part
is that typically in a situation like this,

24:36.643 --> 24:37.849
the coma is induced medically

24:38.061 --> 24:40.017
as the pain can often
be too much for the patient to bear.

24:40.396 --> 24:43.263
We're not sure how Mr. Hale
became comatose, however.

24:43.483 --> 24:47.192
His survival is honestly
a mystery we're still trying to solve.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.610
Moving on.

24:53.034 --> 24:54.945
It was right after the fire.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.653
Meredith could hear him.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.746
Hear what?

25:03.586 --> 25:04.621
Everything.

25:05.213 --> 25:08.125
She was hearing every
thought in his head,

25:08.341 --> 25:10.172
like they'd somehow
found the same wavelength.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.091
And now everything
going through his mind

25:12.303 --> 25:14.419
was also going right into hers.

25:14.597 --> 25:15.712
For how long?

25:15.932 --> 25:17.843
Weeks.
Maybe even months.

25:18.059 --> 25:20.425
It was almost like
he was standing right over her bed

25:20.603 --> 25:22.218
talking about the fire.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.887
About getting revenge.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.977
I predicted this.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.605
I told...

25:33.825 --> 25:36.032
I told Talia this
was going to happen.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.155
Something like this
was going to happen.

25:38.371 --> 25:39.986
I said that they were
gonna come for us.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.618
The Argents.
They're gonna come for us.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.454
They are gonna burn us to the ground.

25:48.006 --> 25:50.588
They're gonna burn us to the ground.
Did she listen?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.457
Of course not.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.799
Did anyone listen?

25:57.223 --> 25:58.429
They listened to her.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.473
Yes! Say that everything
was going to be fine.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.807
That we were all perfectly safe.
Perfectly safe.

26:05.023 --> 26:06.854
But she made us weak!
She made us weak.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.102
And what happens
to the weakest in the herd?

26:09.318 --> 26:11.479
They get picked off by the predators!

26:11.696 --> 26:14.312
We used to be the apex predators.

26:17.035 --> 26:19.572
Until Talia
turned us into sheep.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.492
But I'll start over.

26:25.043 --> 26:29.127
Like a vengeful God,
I will raze this earth to the ground!

26:30.965 --> 26:33.047
I will take out all of them!

26:33.384 --> 26:36.171
Not just the wolves,
but the Wendigos,

26:36.387 --> 26:38.673
the banshees, every shape shifter.

26:38.890 --> 26:41.176
I will obliterate the weak

26:42.060 --> 26:46.144
and I will remake
the supernatural of Beacon Hills

26:46.355 --> 26:47.765
in my image.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.437
I won't have to do any of it myself.

26:53.029 --> 26:56.817
Because |'|| hire people.
Assassins. Professional killers.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.866
People like The Mute.
The Chemist. Even...

27:01.037 --> 27:03.779
Someone like the Desert Wolf.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.538
I'll use the money in the Vault.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.289
The bearer bonds.
I'll use every penny if I have to.

27:14.509 --> 27:16.465
I'll start with the professionals,

27:16.677 --> 27:19.134
and then maybe
I'll disseminate the list further.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.799
No. No.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.011
Not a list.

27:27.021 --> 27:28.431
A dead pool.

27:31.192 --> 27:33.854
Eventually everybody will want a chance.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.810
Anyone can become
a killer for the right price

27:36.030 --> 27:37.770
because when it comes down to it,

27:37.990 --> 27:41.824
everyone can be corrupted by money!

27:56.926 --> 27:59.167
It was your idea
and you don't even remember.

28:09.981 --> 28:12.017
What are we doing?
This room wasn't even made for us.

28:12.233 --> 28:14.144
No, we need someone
like Lydia or Meredith,

28:14.360 --> 28:16.692
and we're just sitting here
listening to a stupid record player

28:16.863 --> 28:18.945
play a record that doesn't play anything.

28:19.532 --> 28:20.487
Come on.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.533
There's plenty of other
things we can be totally useless doing.

28:28.583 --> 28:29.868
Stiles.

28:30.835 --> 28:31.790
Yes?

28:32.879 --> 28:34.289
I can still hear it.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.127
But it's not on.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.006
Then it's something else.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.627
Something spinning.

30:06.681 --> 30:08.012
What is this?

30:09.976 --> 30:11.091
The dead pool.

30:46.095 --> 30:48.211
- How many are there?
- Too many!

30:50.099 --> 30:52.715
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands where I can see them.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.097
How the hell was I supposed
to remember any of that?

30:57.648 --> 30:59.149
She got it from you.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.232
I was out of my mind.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.985
Do you know what it's like
for one of us to be in a coma?

31:05.323 --> 31:08.941
Paralyzed but cognizant?
You try not going crazy.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.617
- She was listening to you.
- She was listening

31:11.829 --> 31:14.992
to the ranting and raving of a lunatic.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.455
A former lunatic.
I'm much healthier now.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.456
I had nothing to do with this.

31:21.672 --> 31:25.164
If she was following your lead on this,
then how do we know there isn't more?

31:26.302 --> 31:29.669
Stealing my own money? Really?

31:29.889 --> 31:32.676
- You were going to use it anyway.
- Stop.

31:32.892 --> 31:35.599
Stop it. This is what she wants.
It's why she's here.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.428
Look around, Sheriff.
There's three people in here right now.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.604
Three people still on the dead pool.

31:42.026 --> 31:44.438
Me, Parrish...

31:45.613 --> 31:46.944
And Meredith.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.776
- But not him.
- Lydia's right.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.323
We don't want to kill each other.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.400
The only person
I'm pointing a gun at is you.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.782
Then you better make it
a perfect shot, Sheriff,

31:55.998 --> 31:58.956
- because I don't go down easy.
- I'm willing to bet

31:59.168 --> 32:02.285
that a bullet between the eyes
doesn't heal real fast...

32:03.047 --> 32:04.708
- Not even for your kind.
- Stop.

32:04.924 --> 32:05.913
Please, stop.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.754
This department's
getting more corrupt by the second.

32:09.637 --> 32:11.502
What are you going
to charge me with, Sheriff?

32:12.348 --> 32:16.091
How are you going to
explain this to a judge?

32:16.310 --> 32:17.641
Telepathic girl

32:17.853 --> 32:21.061
overhears thoughts
of comatose werewolf

32:21.273 --> 32:23.935
and decides to enact
his plans for retribution?

32:25.903 --> 32:28.861
They're gonna be pointing a gun
at your head asking you to go quietly.

32:30.199 --> 32:33.066
Let him go. You have to let him go.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.412
I'd take the word of a Banshee, Sheriff.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.330
I leave. No triggers pulled.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.040
No blood shed.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.586
That's twice, Peter.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.753
There's not gonna be a third.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.677
No. It's not finished.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.929
No, it's not finished!

33:00.187 --> 33:02.394
No! It's not done.

33:02.773 --> 33:04.638
It's not finished!

33:05.151 --> 33:06.186
No. Hey!

33:08.028 --> 33:10.986
You can'tjust smash it to pieces. Okay?

33:11.240 --> 33:13.447
If this thing's being used
to disseminate the list,

33:13.659 --> 33:16.321
then it's probably gonna
keep going until everyone's dead.

33:16.537 --> 33:19.654
- Then what do we do?
- It needs some kind of prompt

33:19.874 --> 33:21.990
or command or something, right?

33:22.960 --> 33:24.370
No, no, no.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.544
What about a key?

33:50.613 --> 33:52.569
Get the others back.
Tell them to hide.

33:54.909 --> 33:56.740
Kira! Kira!

34:02.541 --> 34:03.747
You see it?

34:04.001 --> 34:05.741
There's got to be a way
to turn it off, right?

34:06.003 --> 34:06.958
I don't know.

34:07.129 --> 34:09.085
I don't know anything about
computers from the I970s.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.924
Lydia, there is no monitor.
There are buttons,

34:14.136 --> 34:16.001
knobs, spindles, no monitor.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.837
Wait, turn the phone back.
Point it at the carpet.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.719
- The what?
- The floor! Just show me the floor.

34:24.355 --> 34:25.515
Where's the stain?

34:25.981 --> 34:27.972
There should be red blotches,
a wine stain.

34:28.484 --> 34:29.519
There's nothing.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.983
That doesn't make sense.

34:32.905 --> 34:35.692
I gave the $500 I was supposed
to use to hire cleaners to Brunski.

34:35.908 --> 34:37.694
Lydia, what the hell does wine
have to do with anything?

34:37.910 --> 34:39.866
Red wine doesn't just disappear.

34:41.664 --> 34:44.280
- Unless it wasn't wine.
- What? What do you mean?

34:44.875 --> 34:47.287
The ashes weren't ashes.
The study isn't a study.

34:47.503 --> 34:49.789
The record player
isn't a record player. So...

34:50.005 --> 34:52.257
So maybe the wine wasn't wine.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.504
Stiles, you have to find the wine.
Find the bottle.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.711
- There could be something about it.
- What kind? What's it called?

34:58.931 --> 35:01.343
It's a 1982 Cotes du Rhone.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.972
I think there's something inside.
Do you have, like, a wine opener or...

35:40.055 --> 35:41.135
Brett?

35:41.348 --> 35:43.179
Brett, where are you?

38:13.041 --> 38:14.167
Is it over?

38:14.877 --> 38:15.992
Really over?

38:23.927 --> 38:25.178
Are you okay?

38:29.057 --> 38:30.968
I guess you are, aren't you?

38:33.812 --> 38:36.224
For someone who'd put
their own name on a hit list.

38:36.899 --> 38:38.184
I had to.

38:39.610 --> 38:40.895
Why?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.560
Because I heard you.

38:44.239 --> 38:47.982
I heard you scream
in the tunnels at Oak Creek.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.152
Allison!

38:55.042 --> 38:58.000
That's why I knew it was the right time...

38:59.588 --> 39:00.919
To start over.

39:03.383 --> 39:04.839
But with Peter?

39:07.304 --> 39:08.840
He's the alpha.

39:09.973 --> 39:12.009
He's always been the alpha.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.016
He'll make it right.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.436
It never was with us.

39:19.900 --> 39:23.688
Too many people died because of us.

39:27.407 --> 39:28.783
We're the monsters.

39:29.785 --> 39:31.446
Even banshees.

39:32.663 --> 39:34.073
Even me.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.282
I don't believe that.

39:41.672 --> 39:45.210
Not all monsters do monstrous things.

39:46.677 --> 39:48.042
Like who?

39:49.847 --> 39:51.178
Like Scott.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.522
Like you.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.190
Oh, God.

40:12.786 --> 40:14.287
What have I done?

40:18.250 --> 40:20.662
- You look nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

40:21.253 --> 40:22.993
I'm rattled.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.125
I don't like being rattled.

40:26.341 --> 40:27.842
But it's over.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.336
The dead pool's done.

40:29.553 --> 40:33.842
And if you need to be reminded,
everything else is going exactly your way.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.347
Not exactly my way.

40:36.518 --> 40:39.806
Maybe every little piece in your game
didn't move just as predicted,

40:40.022 --> 40:41.978
but they still moved perfectly into place.

40:59.041 --> 41:00.781
You wanna bail on the plan.

41:05.047 --> 41:06.503
Not when I'm this close.

41:08.258 --> 41:12.092
Not when I'm this close
to killing Scott McCall.
