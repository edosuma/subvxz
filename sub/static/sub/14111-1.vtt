02:43.200 --> 02:45.316
It was the witching hour,

02:45.480 --> 02:47.596
when the bogeyman comes out.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.635
When people go missing.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.675
Matron thinks the witching hour
arrives at midnight.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.031
The girls say 1:00
or 2:00 in the morning.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.630
I think it comes at 3: 00 in the morning,

03:29.800 --> 03:32.189
when I'm the only one left awake.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.518
Like always.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.798
Like now.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.016
Hat's in your eyes, mate.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.536
Quiet. Quiet.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.551
- It's that way!
- Shh!

03:56.720 --> 03:58.199
Quiet.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.236
Come on.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.749
- Shh.
- Quiet.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.116
Get outta the water, mate.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.952
It's unclean.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.075
That stuff will kill you.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.875
Oi!

04:17.680 --> 04:19.557
You're bladdered, the lot of you.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.589
Would you clear off?

04:21.680 --> 04:24.592
There are children trying to sleep.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.355
Hello, little missy!

04:26.520 --> 04:29.159
Don't little missy me!

04:29.480 --> 04:32.233
I'll call the coppers. I will do it.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.075
Watch the water! Come on!

06:47.760 --> 06:50.320
Never get out of bed.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.428
Never go to the window

07:04.280 --> 07:08.558
and never look behind

07:09.440 --> 07:10.714
the curtain.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.110
Never get out of bed!
Never go to the window!

08:04.200 --> 08:05.952
And never look behind the curtain.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.472
There ain't no place to go

12:11.840 --> 12:13.239
unless you has wings.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.959
I is hungry. It's time for eats.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.117
Whoa! Whoa!

12:34.160 --> 12:35.752
Where am I?

12:35.840 --> 12:37.193
Giant Country.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.910
No such place.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.918
We travelled a long, long way.

12:52.040 --> 12:55.032
Yeah, it be a distance.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.551
What's that? What's that?

13:10.720 --> 13:12.073
Giants.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.195
There are more of you?

13:15.640 --> 13:17.198
Yeah, well...

13:17.320 --> 13:21.791
Fleshlumpeater, Bonecruncher, Manhugger...

13:21.880 --> 13:27.637
Childchewer, Meatdripper,
Gizzardgulper, Maidmasher...

13:27.840 --> 13:29.193
Bloodbottler.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.429
Bloodbottler?

13:30.520 --> 13:32.954
Yeah! And the Butcher Boy.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.878
Butcher Boy?

13:36.320 --> 13:37.753
Please don't eat me.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.119
Me?

13:43.200 --> 13:48.149
You think because I'm a giant,
that I'm a man-gobbling cannybull?

13:53.440 --> 13:55.749
Me?
Gobbling up human beans?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.195
Do you mind?
This I never...

13:58.680 --> 13:59.874
Then who are you?

13:59.960 --> 14:01.791
What kind of a monster are you?

14:01.960 --> 14:03.154
You has me wrong.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.396
You snatched me.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.950
Yeah, well, there you has me right.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.673
Anyway, I didn't steal you very much.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.830
After all, you's only a little thing.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.078
Still, but I can't help thinking about

14:21.160 --> 14:22.673
your poor mother and father.

14:22.760 --> 14:23.954
They must be skump...

14:24.120 --> 14:26.315
I don't have a mother or father.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.675
You don't?

14:30.360 --> 14:32.590
They... They both died when I was a baby.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.398
So you is a norphan?

14:35.680 --> 14:38.114
Yes. You took me from an orphanage.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.269
You didn't know?

14:39.880 --> 14:42.269
I didn't know that.

14:43.520 --> 14:44.953
Were you happy there?

14:45.040 --> 14:47.713
No, I hate it.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.713
The matron who runs it is incompetent,
and she has crazy rules

14:51.800 --> 14:53.995
and you get punished a lot!

14:54.720 --> 14:56.358
How is you punished?

14:57.160 --> 14:58.752
She locks you in a dark cellar.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.319
There are rats down there.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.789
The filthy old fizzwiggler.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.988
The other giants,
are they nice like you're nice?

15:12.200 --> 15:15.829
No, I's sorry to say,
the boys would eat you up in one dollop.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.756
My 24 foot?

15:20.080 --> 15:22.230
Puddlenuts in Giant Country.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.356
And that's where you is,
in Giant Country now.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.271
But why did you bring me here,
and why did you take me?

15:30.640 --> 15:33.438
Well, I had to take you

15:34.720 --> 15:38.554
'cause the first thing you'd be doing,
you'd be scuttling around

15:39.160 --> 15:42.835
and yodelling the news
that you were actually seeing a giant.

15:43.560 --> 15:47.439
And then, there would be a great
rumple dumpus, wouldn't there?

15:47.640 --> 15:49.676
And all the human beans
would be rummaging

15:49.800 --> 15:53.270
and whiffling for the giant what you saw,
and getting wildly excited.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.794
And then they'd be locking me up in a cage

15:56.280 --> 16:00.068
to be looked at with all the squiggling,
you know...

16:00.160 --> 16:03.948
Hippodumplings, and crocadowndillies,
and jiggyraffes.

16:04.400 --> 16:09.872
And then, there would a gigantous
look-see giant hunt for all of the boys.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.234
I won't tell.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.797
No one would listen to me anyway.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.553
I'm an untrustworthy child.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.958
Yes, you would.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.318
No, I wouldn't.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.033
Yes, you would.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.269
No, I wouldn't.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.356
- Yes, you would.
- No, I wouldn't!

16:26.440 --> 16:29.193
You would be telling the whole wonky world

16:29.280 --> 16:32.317
most likely on the telly-telly bunkum box

16:32.400 --> 16:34.391
and the radio squeaker.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.512
I won't tell. I wouldn't ever.

16:38.320 --> 16:42.233
Please, take me home.
I'm scared. I want to go home.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.032
No.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.513
That's horrible.

17:02.160 --> 17:07.996
You're just gonna have to be stayin' here
with me for the rest of our lives.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.832
You mean, of my life.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.636
For the rest of my life.

17:16.920 --> 17:22.438
Hey, is you not all frigidy cold, eh?

17:22.760 --> 17:24.715
In your little nightie.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.111
I will run away.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.957
Listen. Listen, you.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.237
I is warnin' you

17:37.520 --> 17:42.389
not to ever go whiffling out of this cave
without I is with you

17:42.560 --> 17:45.836
or you is comin' to an ucky mucky end.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.439
You can't stop me.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.590
I've run away 1,000 times.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.511
I have instincts.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.834
Instincts?
I thought human beans was full of brains.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.155
You is not very clever.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.595
I can stop you.

18:00.760 --> 18:01.954
Eh.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.439
Those giants,

18:03.560 --> 18:08.759
they would swallop you up
like a piece of frumpkin fry.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.117
It's pumpkin pie, not frumpkin fry.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.436
And jiggyraffes are giraffes.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.030
Crocadowndillies are crocodiles,

18:17.200 --> 18:19.998
and hippodumplings are hippopotamuses.

18:23.640 --> 18:27.679
Well, I cannot be helpin' it
if I was sayin' things a little squiggly.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.634
I cannot be right all the time.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.752
Quite often, I is left instead of right.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.790
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.389
Yeah.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.479
Well, what I'm says and what I means

18:49.560 --> 18:53.075
is sometimes two different things.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.193
Hey, what is you reading?

19:02.240 --> 19:03.753
Nicholas Nickleby.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.836
- Ah?
- What's in those jars?

19:08.840 --> 19:09.989
Dreams.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.239
Dreams aren't things.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.874
I don't dream, actually. I've got insomnia.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.391
Is that right?

19:25.240 --> 19:30.917
Dreams is actually very mysterious things.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.638
All the time

19:32.720 --> 19:35.154
they is searching

19:35.240 --> 19:36.673
for...

19:36.760 --> 19:38.671
For sleeping

19:39.840 --> 19:41.319
people.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.352
"With throbbing veins and burning skin

19:48.480 --> 19:50.789
"eyes wild and heavy."

19:50.880 --> 19:53.314
You can... You can read!

19:54.360 --> 19:55.998
Yeah.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.117
"Thoughts hurried and disordered

19:59.200 --> 20:04.354
"he felt as though the light were rep-roach

20:04.480 --> 20:09.315
"and shrunk involuntarily from the day

20:09.880 --> 20:15.716
"as if he were some foul and hideous

20:18.000 --> 20:19.513
"thing."

22:33.200 --> 22:34.474
Help me!

22:36.280 --> 22:37.599
No! Help!

22:39.320 --> 22:41.390
Help me!

22:42.200 --> 22:43.519
Help!

23:03.520 --> 23:05.238
You did that.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.191
There you has me right.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.754
I told you I didn't dream

23:09.840 --> 23:11.990
so it was much scarier
than it needed to be.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.671
Needs must.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.279
Titchy little snapperwhippers like you

23:18.360 --> 23:22.638
should not be higgling around
with old sage and onions like me.

23:25.240 --> 23:29.074
Giants is all murderful and cannybulls.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.798
They's swallopin' up human beans
like they's sugar lumps.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.990
"Beings", not "beans".

23:36.320 --> 23:39.915
Yeah, well, they'd eat you either way.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.556
What...
What is that green fizz?

23:48.920 --> 23:50.433
Frobscottle.

23:50.800 --> 23:54.270
All giants is drinking frobscottle.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.555
It... It's fizzing the wrong way.

24:00.880 --> 24:01.949
Eh?

24:02.160 --> 24:04.435
Our bubbles go up.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.350
Up? Up?

24:08.160 --> 24:12.119
Upward-going bubbles gives
a filthsome belchy burp.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.275
But what's wrong with
a little burp now and then?

24:15.760 --> 24:18.228
It's loathsome.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.273
But if the bubbles in your tummy go down

24:21.360 --> 24:24.830
and come out someplace else...

24:24.960 --> 24:27.952
- Yeah?
- That could have a far nastier result.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.039
A whizzpopper.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.237
- Whizzpopper?
- Yeah.

24:33.440 --> 24:36.955
A sign of true happiness.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.673
Oh, no.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.472
It's glummy!

24:52.080 --> 24:53.877
Whoopie!

24:56.800 --> 24:59.189
Whoa!

24:59.800 --> 25:01.552
Runt.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.152
Is you at home, Runt?

25:09.800 --> 25:10.869
No.

25:10.960 --> 25:14.191
You is jabbeling.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.555
Who is you jabbeling to, Runt?

25:21.280 --> 25:24.750
Why is you such a chatbag in the morning?

25:25.040 --> 25:26.996
Why is you not sleeping today?

25:27.080 --> 25:29.833
Because you keep me awake
with your jabbeling.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.878
I has a boo-boo.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.036
Oh, possibly later.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.674
Now, Runt!

25:41.760 --> 25:43.796
Never mind, I will. Don't...

25:43.880 --> 25:48.032
Right, now we just have
to fetch some water.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.112
No, no, no. No water.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.148
No water.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.320
Hide behind something.
Hide behind there.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.278
All right. Gimme it.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.794
Gimme it. Give it here.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.313
Does you have a new little petty-poo?

26:21.760 --> 26:22.875
No.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.117
I smells bean, Runt. I finds him...

26:26.200 --> 26:28.156
- Hold still.
- ...I eats him up.

26:28.240 --> 26:30.834
You is barking up the wrong dog.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.956
There ain't no bean here.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.152
I is hungry.

26:44.240 --> 26:47.198
Hey, yeah.
Why don't you have that snozzcumber?

26:47.560 --> 26:51.439
Oh, that is a scrumptious snozzcumber.
It's fresh.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.590
You lives on some rotten garbage, Runt.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.875
Don't be like that.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.269
- Have you never tried that, Fleshlumpeater?
- No, never.

26:57.360 --> 27:02.514
I'll tell you, I's guzzling that wonderveg
gleefully, night and day.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.040
Well, that's what's wrong with you.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.917
The outside is horrigust.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.916
But the inside is smelling something...

27:14.240 --> 27:15.673
...sweetly familiar.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.155
Yeah! Go on! Go on, boy.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.749
Get your lips around that. That is lovely.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.592
- Wait! Wait!
- Huh?

27:25.880 --> 27:29.236
You hates vegetables! You eats only beans!

27:29.960 --> 27:31.837
I hate vegeterribles.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.798
I eats only beans.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.633
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.789
Yeah!

27:38.240 --> 27:39.275
Yeah.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.199

27:41.680 --> 27:44.638

32:53.080 --> 32:54.832
Uh, to work.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.359

32:56.440 --> 33:00.513
Oh, now you's asking me to tell you
whopsie big secrets!

33:01.440 --> 33:02.919

33:03.360 --> 33:04.759
How could I anyway?

33:04.960 --> 33:06.791
I'm stuck here for the rest of my life.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.271

33:41.520 --> 33:44.432

33:44.520 --> 33:47.717
I goes alone. I's a feature of habit.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.194
But you'll be leaving me here with them.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.158

35:50.320 --> 35:51.912
You must take me.

35:52.040 --> 35:53.598

35:53.880 --> 35:56.678

35:58.600 --> 36:00.909
And I steal sometimes. And I lie.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.197
So... So I'm lonely most of the time.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.875

37:55.120 --> 37:57.395
You know I was going off to my work.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.831
Gizzardgulper, go long.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.670
Oh! Oh!

38:45.000 --> 38:47.753

38:47.840 --> 38:49.068

38:55.320 --> 38:56.435

38:59.680 --> 39:00.874
Whoa!

39:16.680 --> 39:18.159

Huh? Huh?

41:14.720 --> 41:16.472
Bean.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.197
Now...

41:25.480 --> 41:29.314
You...
You shouldn't let them treat you like that.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.628
Nobody should.

41:32.200 --> 41:35.954
I lives with nine bean-eating giants.

41:37.480 --> 41:40.631
They takes, so I gives back.
I blows my dreams about.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.478
Well, that's as good as I can do.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.390
I do something, eh?

41:49.120 --> 41:50.951
I do something.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.078
We is here, at last.

42:20.440 --> 42:23.989
You is in Dream Country now, missy.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.916
I shared you a secret.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.957
Look at all the stars.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.432
Oh, yeah.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.710
Often enough, on a clear night
I is hearing faraway music

42:42.840 --> 42:45.195
coming from those stars in the sky.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.392
- You do? What else?
- Well...

42:49.920 --> 42:52.480
I is hearing the tiny little ants
chittering to each other

42:52.560 --> 42:54.391
as they skiddle about in the soil.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.316
Cattlepiddlers though,
they is the worst chatbags.

43:00.360 --> 43:05.115
All the time, they is arguing about
who will be the most pretty butteryflies.

43:07.040 --> 43:09.110
Go on, please.

43:10.520 --> 43:14.718
I hear the footsteps of a lady bird
as she walks across a leaf.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.075
But the funniest...

43:17.160 --> 43:20.516
The funniest old stories I's heard from
the plants and the trees themselves.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.914
Yeah.

43:22.040 --> 43:27.160
They is living and growing,
laughing, chittering, just like you and me.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.478
Come on, down you go.

43:33.080 --> 43:34.559
Yeah.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.276
I is hearing all the wondrous
and all the terrible...

43:41.520 --> 43:43.033
Terrible, terrible things.

43:43.560 --> 43:47.439
All the secret whisperings of the world.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.750
Really?

43:51.720 --> 43:54.280
You think I's swizzfiggling you, don't you?

43:54.480 --> 43:55.993
No.

43:56.160 --> 44:00.039
It's just all rather hard to believe.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.714
At one point, someone...

44:37.200 --> 44:38.599
Someone called me the...

44:38.800 --> 44:40.995
The Big Friendly Giant.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.031
What shall I call you, gal?

44:59.360 --> 45:01.078
My name is Sophie.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.916
Well, jump, Sophie.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.791
This be where all my dreams is beginning.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.472
Oh, my...

46:05.840 --> 46:10.994
As a dream comes whiffling by
it's so silvery soft,

46:11.680 --> 46:16.231
it was making like a tiny little buzzing,
humming sound, like music.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.118
Bogswinkles!

46:38.120 --> 46:40.190
It's a phizzwizard!

46:41.760 --> 46:43.955
I don't be seeing many of them any more.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.071
It's behind you on your elbow!

46:55.280 --> 46:56.998
No, not that elbow! The other one!

46:59.280 --> 47:00.793
Now it's on your foot!

47:01.600 --> 47:02.953
The other foot!

47:12.760 --> 47:14.113
It's on your bottom!

47:40.280 --> 47:41.759
I gots it.

47:43.880 --> 47:45.472
Seems to know you, gal.

47:46.520 --> 47:47.589
Look.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.352
It is a golden phizzwizard.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.991
I wish I could hear it.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.269
Here.

47:57.440 --> 48:00.159
It be's very soft.

48:09.960 --> 48:13.555
Do you actually hear what these dreams say?

48:13.640 --> 48:14.959
Yeah, I do.

48:16.960 --> 48:20.077
Well, this one sounds like you.

48:27.320 --> 48:29.470
Hello, beautiful dream.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.035
It...

48:56.000 --> 48:57.319
Look.

48:57.400 --> 49:00.198
Go on, make yourself useful,
my little frogglefrump.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.429
I...

49:01.520 --> 49:03.511
- I couldn't.
- Yeah, you could.

49:03.680 --> 49:06.353
Use your hands,
your titchy little figglers.

49:47.800 --> 49:48.949
Oh.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.433
Ah! I got one!

50:22.520 --> 50:24.112
Let it go, Sophie.

50:24.520 --> 50:26.272
Give it here. Give it to me.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.192
Give it to me.

50:28.320 --> 50:29.992
Go, give it here.

50:32.440 --> 50:33.998
Oh, mince my maggots.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.359
I think this be a very, very bad dream.

50:37.960 --> 50:40.155
There are bad dreams here, too?

50:42.560 --> 50:44.835
It be a trogglehumper.

50:51.720 --> 50:53.517
What are you going to do with it?

50:54.640 --> 50:58.235
I locks them up, you wicked beastie, you.

51:00.320 --> 51:02.231
What does the bad dream say?

51:04.160 --> 51:05.559
It says...

51:07.480 --> 51:13.157
"Look at what you has done
and there be no forgiveness."

51:21.400 --> 51:23.038
Where are you?

51:25.600 --> 51:27.158
I can't see you.

51:30.680 --> 51:32.398
Big Friendly Giant!

52:04.920 --> 52:09.198
Big Friendly Giant, I'm going to call you

52:09.960 --> 52:11.473
BFG.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.915
You calls me what you likes.

52:15.080 --> 52:17.514
Where are you going next?

52:17.600 --> 52:18.953
Dream-blowing.

52:19.960 --> 52:22.110
It be as good as I can do.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.913
Why here?

53:04.280 --> 53:06.840
Because I hears a little heart.

53:09.360 --> 53:11.476
What be your pleasure, missy?

53:15.520 --> 53:17.272
Make them all happy.

53:37.960 --> 53:41.794
BFG, did your mother or father
teach you about dreams?

53:42.320 --> 53:45.471
Giants don't have mothers or fathers.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.798
Never?

53:48.040 --> 53:49.314
How old are you?

53:49.640 --> 53:53.997
Oh, I's as old as the Earth, I suppose.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.355
I is getting a little bit crumply

53:56.480 --> 54:02.476
but us giants is mostly just
going on and on, and on...

54:02.640 --> 54:04.915
Like whiffsy time-twiddlers.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.472
BFG...

54:07.840 --> 54:10.877
...did you hear
my heart at the orphanage?

54:11.760 --> 54:14.194
Yeah, I hears it right now.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.310
What does the dream say?

55:00.440 --> 55:01.555
Well...

55:01.760 --> 55:04.911
The boy, he's dreaming that the tellyphony

55:05.040 --> 55:06.616
is ringing in his house.

55:06.640 --> 55:08.995
His da, he answers it and he says,

55:09.080 --> 55:11.958
"Yes, this is Mr Goulash speaking."

55:12.440 --> 55:16.115
And then, he's gasping
like he has a lobster stuck in his throat.

55:16.240 --> 55:18.879
And he's saying, "Who? What?
Yes, sir, I understand.

55:19.120 --> 55:23.398
"But, surely, sir, it is me you wish
to be speaking to, not my little boy."

55:23.600 --> 55:26.239
And then, his face turns white
and his eyes pop out of his head

55:26.920 --> 55:29.912
and he says, "Yes, sir. He is here, sir.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir."

55:30.120 --> 55:32.315
And he hands the phone to the boy.

55:32.480 --> 55:37.679
"Is you knowing the President
of the United States?" he asks.

55:37.840 --> 55:39.239
"No," says the boy.

55:39.320 --> 55:41.754
"But I suspect he's hearing about me."

55:44.000 --> 55:46.958
And then he takes the phone, the boy,
and he...

55:47.080 --> 55:50.959
He's having a long chittery chat
on the phone with the President.

55:51.440 --> 55:54.352
"Well, let me take care of it,
Mr President.

55:54.440 --> 55:55.919
"No, no. No, no, no.

55:56.040 --> 55:59.430
"You'll bungle it up, sir,
if you do it all your way."

55:59.520 --> 56:00.800
And his dad...

56:00.840 --> 56:03.035
...his eyes is
googling out of his head.

56:03.280 --> 56:05.430
And then his ma, she comes into the room.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.193
And his dad, he tells her. And then

56:08.800 --> 56:10.836
so on, and so on, and so on.

56:16.320 --> 56:18.515
Dreams are so quick.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.314
Yeah, on the outside.

56:21.960 --> 56:24.110
They's long on the inside.

56:38.160 --> 56:39.673
Shh... Shh...

56:40.560 --> 56:42.073
What?

56:42.160 --> 56:44.230
I hears lament.

56:45.480 --> 56:49.598
Somebody's silkies is
crying for their darling.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.633
Look!

57:00.320 --> 57:01.958
Monsters.

57:03.840 --> 57:05.319
We have to stop them.

57:05.880 --> 57:08.519
You can't keep living like this, BFG.

57:16.440 --> 57:19.477
BFG, what did you do with my blanket?

57:20.480 --> 57:22.596
I thought you had it there.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.719
Where is it, in my other...

57:24.800 --> 57:28.759
- In the cape?
- Oh, I think I dropped it in Giant Country.

57:34.280 --> 57:36.191
You dropped it in Giant Country?

57:42.640 --> 57:44.995
Giant Country...

58:15.240 --> 58:16.878
Did I fall asleep?

58:20.920 --> 58:23.434
Why are you giving me a dream?

58:24.360 --> 58:27.511
Why are you giving me a dream?

58:30.560 --> 58:33.074
Why are you giving me a dream?

58:33.760 --> 58:35.751
You dropped your blanket.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.591
So they must know you was there.

58:43.680 --> 58:45.591
You's not safe with me, girl.

58:47.280 --> 58:50.192
So? You is not safe with me.

58:50.520 --> 58:52.954
Never mind that now.

58:53.640 --> 58:55.119
There was a boy.

58:58.160 --> 59:01.152
He liked to read. He taught me how to read.

59:02.080 --> 59:05.277
You's wearin' his little red jacket.

59:06.120 --> 59:10.079
I hears his lonely heart
just like I hears yours.

59:10.520 --> 59:15.389
Then he seen me, like you did.

59:16.600 --> 59:18.989
So I had to take him, hipswitch.

59:21.840 --> 59:24.718
I could have brought him back home.

59:26.200 --> 59:28.953
But then it be too late.

59:30.240 --> 59:32.674
It won't be like that.

59:33.440 --> 59:34.873
We'll stop the giants.

59:34.960 --> 59:37.269
We'll make them go away forever.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.196
Was the boy scared?

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.830
Yeah. In the end.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.198
I'm not.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.830
Brave Sophie.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.999
I'm not!

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.714
I'm not.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.239
I'm not.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.719
BFG.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.994
You say you can hear ants talk
and spiders spin.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.557
That you can hear the stars.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.437
Can you still hear me?

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.157
I feel you're here.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.076
I know you're here.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.799
BFG.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.393
Jump, Sophie.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.596
We need a plan...

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.356
We need a plan...

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.675
Need a plan...

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.559
Are you thinking up a plan?

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.999
I's not having the foggiest idea
in the wonky world.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.956
Well, keep at it.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.513
Runt!

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.513
Sophie. Hide.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.995
Oh, Runty,
is you at home?

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.232
Quick, quick, quick!

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.590
I has a boo-boo.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.519
Well, you's a big boy.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.673
You take care of your
boo-boos yourself now.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.194
Oh, I will.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.634
Oh, he will!

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.711
You has a bean.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.434
Right. Out!

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.256
Let's get on with it.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.376
Let's get on with it.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.356
- Time to hunt.
- Time to hunt.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.434
Skitter scatter, boys.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.551
Find me the chiddler.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.194
No, no, no.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.958
No, no. Don't! No!

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.479
No, don't!

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.709
This be my work. This be my work, boys!

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.794
Look at me!

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.438
Once, us giants, we be gentries.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.314
Those days are over.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.234
Where is the delicious little chatbag?

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.517
Oh!

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.238
Right! Out, all of you!

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.480
Toot toot.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.073
Whoa!

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.871
Oh.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.639
He find the last one.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.674
I finds this one.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.118
This be my home.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.948
Ow, hot! Hot!

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.314
You don't come in here any more!

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.431
Go on, get out!

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.318
Cursed you be, Runt.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.435
Get out!

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.596
This be my home!

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.309
You...

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.835
You is insult to giants.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.114
Ow!

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.116
Well, there be more dreams
disappeared into a thick ear.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.392
Into thin air.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.118
Words.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.870
They's all such a twitch-tickling problem
to me all my life.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.110
I knows exactly what words I want to say

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.434
but somehow or other

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.875
they all comes out squiff-squiddled 'round.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.435
Don't worry. That happens to everyone.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.874
Not like it happens to me.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.798
I speak in the most terrible wigglish.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.509
Well, uh, I think you speak beautifully.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.792
You do?

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.799
You really do?

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.077
Mmm-hmm. Simply beautifully.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.432
Oh, that...

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:23.392
Oh, that is the nicest present that
anybody's ever given me in my entire life.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.199
BFG...

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.191
How whoopsey-splunkers.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.954
BFG.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.553
How absolutely...

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.316
What's the word? Squiffling.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.075
- BFG.
- I is all of a stutter.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.752
BFG!

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.033
Yeah, yeah?

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.675
I have a plan.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.193
A plan?

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.679
We are going to the Queen.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.352
We really, really need her help.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.271
We can be there by dawn.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.433
Right.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:08.072
You be giving your Queeny
a frightsome curd-bloodling trogglehumper.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.313
Needs must. Scary as you can make it.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.512
Oh, chiddlers.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.751
The Queen will dream that giants,
all nine of them, are in England.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.278
And they are eating little children.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.269
And be sure to put some army in it.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.676
Be sure you add a little of me.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.828
Right.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.079
Did you add yourself?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.518
The Queen will dream that a little girl
is sitting on her windowsill.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.396
Then, she wakes up and I am there.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.874
We are there.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.037
Uh, then what happens?

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.872
Well, then a Big Friendly
Giant steps forward

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.833
and bows and says,

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.276
"Your Majesty, I am your humble servant."

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.760
You mean she actually sees me?

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.038
No. Not in a month of Mondays, girl.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.915
Huh?

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.394
BFG, stop!
You are going to knock me off.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.832
Just trying to listen to the different
breathing of manly bean and lady bean.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.035
No.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.359
No, no. No, no it's not...

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.795
It's horrible. Don't. Stop them.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.318
Make them stop. Make 'em stop!

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.791
Giants? Giants.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.633
Horrible.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.553
Man... Man-eating giants, no.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.319
No, no, stop. No! No, no, no!

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.549
No!

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.279
Your Majesty.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.595
What is it?

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.432
Oh, Mary.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.111
I had the most horrible dream.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.958
Oh.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.436
Well, only a dream, ma'am, hmm?

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.793
Let me get your tea.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:32.875
I dreamt that girls and boys

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.713
were being snatched out of their beds
in boarding schools

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.668
and were being eaten
by the most ghastly giants.

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.757
There was so many of them.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.353
There was the...

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.953
The Fleshlumpeater

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.071
and the Gizzardgulper

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.230
and the Meatdripper.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.231
And the, uh...

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.679
Butcher Boy?

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.388
Butcher Boy.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.113
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Oh!

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.795
The giants put their hands
in through the windows

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.474
and pluck the children
out with their fingers.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.836
It was so bloody, so vivid, so real.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.475
So real, Mary.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.875
The children just disappeared.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.394
Oh, my.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.029
Uh...

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.320
What's the matter, dear?
You're white as a sheet.

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.394
- Sit down, Mary. Sit.
- Yes.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.556
You're trembling. What is it?

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.999
Well, it's just, uh, so odd, ma'am.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.433
So very odd.

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.913
You haven't seen the papers?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.194
No, I haven't seen them yet.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.032
Well, here. Look.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.871
It's the very dream you had.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.990
Children have disappeared in the night.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.111
Gone. Taken.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.591
But, not by giants.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.672
Well, no, it couldn't be could it, ma'am?

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.872
Draw the curtains.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.193
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.909
Oh!

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.790
I don't believe it.

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.877
There's a small girl
standing on the window sill.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.591
Is there not, Mr Tibbs?

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.917
There is indeed, ma'am.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.800
She is standing right there, ma'am.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.878
You didn't dream it.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.232
But I did dream it.

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.836
How in the world did you get there?

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.416
- Well...
- Let me take care of this, ma'am.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.680
- Here. Come down. Come with me.
- No, no, don't do that.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.074
A giant put you there.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.110
Yes, he did, ma'am.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.998
He's waiting in the garden now.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.508
Is he?

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:20.868
Is he?

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.153
He's my best friend.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.719
He made your dream.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.672
- Did he?
- Did he?

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.193
Did he?

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.231
Queen's garden, rear window, please.

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:34.438
Why have you and your giant come to see me?

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.592
I... I think you would
remember that, Your Majesty,

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.597
if the mixing went well.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.312
Yes, I remember.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.635
You have a plan. You need me.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.149
Yes, we do. Should we call for him now?

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.269
I suppose we should.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.593
You promise you won't hurt him, ma'am?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.911
Rear garden, rear garden, please.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.079
I'm ready.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.073
BFG!

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:25.637
BFG, the Queen would
really like to meet you.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.433
You won't put him in the bunkumhouse?

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.151
Come down from there, child.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.376
Mary, take her downstairs
and get her some breakfast.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.896
- Mr Tibbs, find out where she comes from.
- Come on, dear. Come on.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.878
No! No! No, he's just afraid.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:59.550
He's never done anything like this
in his whole life before.

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.192
BFG, be brave!

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:34.108
You promised you wouldn't hurt him.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:38.035
Mr Tibbs, tell the guards to stand down.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.759
Mr Tibbs?

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.034
Stand down, gentlemen, please. Stand down.

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.959
Dear, come here.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.235
Your Majesty, I am your humble servant.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.833
Your Majester, I is your humbug servant.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.237
I'm so pleased to make your acquaintance.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:19.389
Oh, Majester. Oh, Monacher.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.750
Oh, ruler of

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.632
straight lines.

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.353
I's come, with my little friend Sophie

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.553
to give you a...

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.589
Uh...

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.349
To give me what?

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.315
A sistance.

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.599
Thank you.

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:52.109
I'm sure you have,
but not in my dressing-gown.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.836
Giants, Boris. Man-eating giants.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.592
Have people been disappearing?

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.828
Ha!

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.150
We have verifiable intelligence.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.231
We might need air clearance.
I'll get back to you.

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.794
Nancy, is Ronnie there?

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.558
Well, wake him.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.075
Her Majesty the Queen.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.989
This way, sir. Just follow me.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.638
Follow me.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.994
That's it, sir.

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.035
Slow ahead. Careful. Slow ahead.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.073
And full stop.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.350
To port side, sir. Oh!

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.237
Careful of the antiques, sir.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.671
And up. Up.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.108
Careful, up, up. That's it.

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.312
Hard to port.

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.960
And slow ahead.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.559
Steady...

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.075
Yes, sir.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.628
Oh!

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.956
Bogswinkles! What was that?

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.279
That was Louis Quatorze.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.270
I'm so, so sorry, Your Majesty.

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.595
He's never really been in a house before.

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.392
Your cape, sir.

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.428
What a whoppsy, spliffling room we is in.

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.712
Your valise, sir.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:15.599
Your Majesty.

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.034
This... This room is so gigantous

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:30.795
I's needed bicirculers and telescoops
to see what's going on at either end.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.033
Does he always talk like that?

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.516
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.232
He's never had schooling.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.594
Ah.

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.279
Ah.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.954
Sir.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.349
Please, BFG. Start.

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.268
Oh.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.391
There's only one word for that, Majester.

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.197
Scrumdiddlyumptious.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.470
Oh, that is glummy.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.790
Goodbye snozzcumber.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.392
What's snozzcumber?

01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:01.230
It's this horrible stinky vegetable,
and I'm afraid it's all he has to eat.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.550
Doesn't seem to have
stunted his growth at all.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:09.789
Mmm...

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.751
Pour BFG his coffee, please.

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:22.715
What's that? What's that black stuff?

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.557
What is that?

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.679
Where'd you get all that foam?

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.952
He's magnificent, your giant.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.832
Sophie, dear, do start.

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.398
You must be famished.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.034
It's delumptious.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.149
Ah.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.948
Oguflug!

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:43.992
Please, Majester, what is this
horrible swigpill I's drinking, Majester?

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.313
Would he prefer tea?

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.709
He would prefer frobscottle.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.079
- Frobscottle?
- Yeah.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:54.232
A little gift for Your Majester.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.714
Delunctious, fizzy, frobscottle.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.951
It be a personable ferment.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.828
How kind.

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:06.796
Would Your Majester be so kind
as to honour me with...

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:10.959
...a pour?

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.760
It's fizzing the wrong way.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.038
Our bubbles go up.

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:22.554
Oh, yeah. We wouldn't have some glumptious,
whizzpopping music?

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.389
Does he like music? We have bagpipes.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.956
The generals have been briefed, ma'am.

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.351
This is a story which beggars belief,
but we don't have the time.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:50.391
We're on our way to Giant Country.

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.875
BFG will chart a course for you.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.590
Generals, BFG.

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.559
In 10 hours, the giants will
once again be on the hunt.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.395
And I intend to stop them.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.513
And where exactly is Giant Country, sir?

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.389
Exunctly, well, let's see.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:22.594
Hey.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:28.034
There.

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.713
- What?
- There.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.198
Gentlemen, your men will follow the BFG.

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:37.195
I have promised him you will go
only once to Giant Country.

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.749
You not be finding it a second time.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.431
Just look at those bubbles.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.599
I believe in the BFG.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.159
The BFG!

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.748
To the BFG.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.392
Marvellous bubbles.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.832
To Giant Country.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.718
We will hold here.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:15.350
BFG, I was asking
if you had a plan.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.751
BFG. Do you have a plan?

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:23.190
BFG! Do you have a plan?

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.554
The trogglehumper I caught,
you're giving it to the giants?

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.558
Yeah, I was giving the boys
this most horrigust dream of despair.

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:40.476
If the dream does its job, they wakes
trapped in flush bunking remorse.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:44.115
And if those wopsy bellypoppers out there
does their job,

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.874
then I think we stands a chance.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.755
"Look at what you has done,
and there be no forgiveness."

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.277
Needs must. Now, stand back, girl.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.358
We's brought the hunt to Giant Country.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.595
Uh...

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.796
What is Sophie's dream?

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.878
Your golden phizzwizard.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.155
I don't see much of them any more.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:50.234
But what does it say?

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:00.838
It tells a story of a little gal.

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:04.549
A little chiddler with
her whole life ahead of her.

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.113
With a fambly of her own.

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:12.269
Little chiddlers of her own, too, someday.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.831
There will be great successfuls...

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.519
...and funnies ahead for her,

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:24.637
and truth to tell,
just a dribble of despair.

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.714
Times'll be hard, times is be soft.

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:34.399
Adventures will come and go.

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.439
But in the end

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.753
she remembers the good deeds.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.358
Now, Sophie, I...

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.274
I know

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:52.040
that story be your heart's desire.

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.638
I knows it.

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.754
The dream, it came to you, didn't it?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.070
It be Sophie's dream.

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.871
But, then I wake up.

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.277
Then you wakes up.

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.554
But not here.

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:15.835
No.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.597
You has more dreams to catch,
my little frogglefrump.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:27.518
But not in Giant Country.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.078
But will I still have you?

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:40.110
Will you still hear me when I call for you?

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.552
Are you forgettin' something?

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.679
Are you forgettin' these?

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.756
It be time, BFG.

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.198
Now, where did I put the...

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.835
I left me trumpet at Her Majester's.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.549
Oh, I is such a mixed-up,

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.510
boggled-up giant sometimes.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.557
Deliver us from weasels.

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.958
Sophie?

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:35.755
Oh, no. Oh, no, Sophie.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:03.518
And what does we have here?

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.152
You is a cannybull.

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.513
I is bad.

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.314
Have pity on a poor little giant.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:44.830
You are a very bad giant.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.438
I has no regrets.

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.670
- Runt!
- Run, Sophie! Run!

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.389
It's over, Fleshlumpeater.

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.190
It's over, boy.

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.032
It's time to stop now.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.390
I's always hungry.

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.555
Huh?

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:18.513
Whoa!

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:20.431
Back of the LZ.

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:21.589
Roger that.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.873
Come on, lads!

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.319
Take him away!

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.158
Go! Go, go!

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.919
Secure that side!

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.592
Take cover!

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:40.634
The giants were taken
far, far away

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.995
to a place you've never heard of

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.877
and a place you'll never go.

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:38.472
The Queen sent them off
with snozzcumber seeds.

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:40.750
It was all they would have to eat...

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.194
...and they were just going
to have to get used to it.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.590
It's time to wake up, darling.

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.471
Morning, Sophie.

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:49.992
I had a dream last night.

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.155
In the dream, I was
awakened by a beautiful,

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.754
buzzing, humming noise
floating above my bed.

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.153
I walked to the window

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:07.995
and against the horizon
I saw his long legs leaping,

01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:11.148
suitcase and trumpet in hand.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:16.072
I could see all the way to Giant Country.

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:19.752
I could see the garden BFG was growing.

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.435
He had fruits and berries,
cauliflower and tomatoes.

01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:26.678
He refused to have
Brussels sprouts, though.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.037
But snozzcumbers were still growing
at the side of his cottage.

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:32.875
How else would he make frobscottle?

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:38.429
I saw the stone door,
and the crooked windows.

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.636
His cape was hanging by the door.

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:45.797
I saw the crow's nest and
his sailor boat bed.

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:52.114
I saw his rocking chair
and a fire burning in the fireplace

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:54.873
with a much nicer stew cooking.

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:01.957
I could see the scattered pages
of the book he was writing.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:09.789
He was happy, and I was happy.

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:14.469
When I'm lonely,
which is not nearly as often as before,

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.356
I talk to him and he actually hears me.

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:22.835
Because BFG hears

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.396
all the secret whisperings of the world.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.312
Good morni ng, BFG.
