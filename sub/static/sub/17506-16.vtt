WEBVTT

00:01.379 --> 00:04.070
I cannot believe that you
are actually a minister.

00:04.196 --> 00:05.881
[Ethereal music plays]

00:06.047 --> 00:07.324
Yes, my lamb.

00:07.449 --> 00:09.527
I can marry people, bury people,

00:09.652 --> 00:10.861
grant wishes.

00:10.986 --> 00:13.138
- Honey, you're not a genie.
- Oh.

00:13.304 --> 00:15.266
You know, I am so honored
that Amanda asked me

00:15.391 --> 00:16.767
to officiate her wedding.

00:16.892 --> 00:20.479
And I need to honor her
with the perfect outfit.

00:20.645 --> 00:21.772
Next minister outfit, please.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.399
Both: Ooh.

00:24.565 --> 00:25.484
I like it.

00:25.867 --> 00:28.028
You don't think
it's just a little breasty?

00:28.194 --> 00:31.156
- Yes, totally breasty.
- Yeah.

00:31.322 --> 00:34.159
- Oh, you mean in a bad way.
- Mm-hmm.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.577
Thank you.

00:35.743 --> 00:37.663
You're gonna have so much fun.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.456
Man, I'd give anything to go.

00:39.622 --> 00:40.958
But being on a plane
for five hours with Amy,

00:41.083 --> 00:42.417
no thank you.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.528
Don't they make, like, a
little carrier thing for babies

00:44.653 --> 00:46.197
like they do for pomeranians?

00:46.322 --> 00:48.215
That way you could just stow her.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.676
I'm gonna let you answer that
question for yourself, honey.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.437
But seriously, though,
being stuck on a flight

00:53.562 --> 00:55.639
with a baby who's melting down,

00:55.805 --> 00:57.575
ugh, I hate to say this,

00:57.700 --> 00:59.685
but I hate those people.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.263
I have called the cops
on those people.

01:02.388 --> 01:03.597
No, it'll be great.

01:03.722 --> 01:05.966
It'll just be me and Kevin,
which will be fun.

01:06.091 --> 01:07.151
Although...

01:07.276 --> 01:09.653
Bringing a boyfriend
to a wedding is fraught.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.323
It's nonstop, "when are you
getting married?"

01:12.448 --> 01:14.116
"When are you
gonna pop the question?"

01:14.282 --> 01:17.394
I'm like, "get the hell out
of my face, mee-maw."

01:17.519 --> 01:19.196
And it's even worse for me,

01:19.321 --> 01:22.766
even though I have absolutely
no desire to get married.

01:22.891 --> 01:25.002
Not for me.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.128
Not even with Kevin?

01:26.294 --> 01:27.438
No, I love Kevin.

01:27.563 --> 01:30.382
But I am a strong single lady.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.993
I'm Ava, I don't even
need a last name.

01:33.118 --> 01:35.137
I certainly don't need his.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.180
Ugh, it's gonna be
a challenging weekend.

01:37.346 --> 01:40.217
God, give me strength.

01:40.342 --> 01:43.187
Ooh, I think he heard me.

01:43.312 --> 01:46.982
I felt him reach down and touch
me with his E.T. finger.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.692
Both: Ooh.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.153
Let's see a spin.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.321
Oh, no!

01:53.487 --> 01:55.032
N-o on the coin slot.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.606
I'm so glad we were able

02:27.772 --> 02:29.357
to finally make
this play date happen.

02:29.523 --> 02:30.734
Little Roger and Amy

02:30.859 --> 02:32.652
are just getting along
like gangbusters.

02:32.818 --> 02:33.528
Am I right?

02:33.762 --> 02:34.863
Look at those little monkeys.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.573
Do I hear wedding bells?

02:36.698 --> 02:37.558
Oh!

02:37.683 --> 02:38.950
[Laughter]

02:39.116 --> 02:40.377
I know you're kidding,

02:40.502 --> 02:43.371
but why put that out there?

02:43.537 --> 02:45.816
We were actually supposed to
fly to a wedding this weekend,

02:45.941 --> 02:47.284
but we decided not to,

02:47.409 --> 02:49.211
just too much trouble with
the baby and all.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.188
Oh, God, no way.

02:51.313 --> 02:52.623
Crowded airport.

02:52.748 --> 02:54.325
Stuck on a plane with a screamer.

02:54.450 --> 02:55.559
- Forget it!
- No thanks.

02:55.684 --> 02:56.994
- No thank you.
- No thanks.

02:57.119 --> 02:59.179
Good day, sirs and madams.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.498
Point is, you guys are smart.

03:01.623 --> 03:03.500
Yep.
You're just like us.

03:03.625 --> 03:04.735
You know that when you have a kid

03:04.860 --> 03:06.353
you gotta give a lot of stuff up.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.838
Well, every couple is different.

03:07.963 --> 03:09.231
Yeah, I think we're quite...

03:09.397 --> 03:12.400
Nope, nope, we're all the same.

03:12.566 --> 03:13.894
Again, I don't know.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.179
We could make this trip, honey.

03:15.304 --> 03:16.279
We could.

03:16.445 --> 03:17.989
Amy's a complete trooper.

03:18.155 --> 03:19.516
I think she could do it.

03:19.641 --> 03:21.993
Yeah, you know, I used to fly
all the time for business.

03:22.159 --> 03:24.788
Kind of an expert.
Platinum club.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.358
Let's just say
that if you found yourself

03:27.483 --> 03:28.926
at Dulles international airport

03:29.051 --> 03:31.495
and you ran into a skycap named Chet,

03:31.620 --> 03:33.497
he'd have some
pretty cool things to say

03:33.622 --> 03:35.032
about Chris Brinkley.

03:35.157 --> 03:38.176
Boy, that's a flaccid
back-door brag there,

03:38.342 --> 03:39.803
isn't it?

03:39.969 --> 03:41.538
Should we go?

03:41.663 --> 03:43.849
- Should we do this?
- No, ma'am. No.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.342
If we leave now, we can
probably make it be tonight.

03:45.467 --> 03:46.351
Yeah.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.878
Quit joshing!

03:48.003 --> 03:50.897
Now let's defrost a Totino's.

03:51.063 --> 03:52.858
You can keep your Totino's.
We're going.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.317
We're going to the wedding.

03:54.483 --> 03:56.278
I love that you haven't given up.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.654
I never give up.

04:00.781 --> 04:02.559
Okay, we are not here
to make friends.

04:02.684 --> 04:03.560
We're here to get through

04:03.685 --> 04:05.262
as quickly as possible for Amy,

04:05.387 --> 04:06.563
so we need to stick to the plan.

04:06.688 --> 04:09.633
All right, so the key
is to keep Amy happy and awake

04:09.758 --> 04:10.984
until we get on the flight, right?

04:11.109 --> 04:12.986
Yep, I got two bottles
all ready to go.

04:13.111 --> 04:14.822
Sweet potatoes are locked and loaded.

04:14.947 --> 04:16.490
Nice, and we give her
her first bottle

04:16.615 --> 04:17.658
once we get through security?

04:17.783 --> 04:18.942
Yep, second one on takeoff,

04:19.067 --> 04:20.793
another one at nap time,
and on landing.

04:20.918 --> 04:22.546
Okay, good.
I'm losing it, I'm losing it.

04:22.671 --> 04:24.306
The pack 'n play
is causing it to list.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.682
Babe, babe.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.001
This stupid cart is like
a metaphor for this entire trip.

04:28.126 --> 04:30.003
It's not a metaphor.
We got this.

04:30.128 --> 04:32.122
Now, which one is us?

04:32.247 --> 04:34.274
Ugh.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.068
You know what?
We are platinum club members.

04:37.234 --> 04:38.695
- Yeah.
- Platinum!

04:38.861 --> 04:40.780
- Give me the stuff, here.
- Okay.

04:40.946 --> 04:43.400
I know how to schmooze
these airport employees.

04:43.525 --> 04:44.451
Oh, sorry.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.328
Hi, Sharon.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.580
Let me start by saying

04:48.746 --> 04:50.441
I love your nails.

04:50.566 --> 04:52.209
What is that, crackle Polish?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.753
Yes. How many people
are traveling today?

04:54.919 --> 04:57.247
We have two platinum member adults

04:57.372 --> 05:01.201
and one beautiful,
gorgeous baby girl.

05:01.326 --> 05:02.844
So...

05:03.010 --> 05:06.256
I actually love this airport.

05:06.381 --> 05:08.975
Kinda one of my all-time faves.

05:09.141 --> 05:11.019
How long you been working here?

05:11.185 --> 05:12.729
Since I was 18.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.814
Wow, so what's that,
about three years?

05:14.980 --> 05:18.001
So we have Mr. Brinkley in 8-c

05:18.126 --> 05:20.053
and Mrs. Brinkley in 22-b.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.055
Wait, no, no, no,
we're not sitting together?

05:22.180 --> 05:24.107
Okay, hi, Sharon, here's the thing.

05:24.232 --> 05:26.810
Our whole baby travel plan thing

05:26.935 --> 05:29.204
is contingent on us sitting together,

05:29.370 --> 05:32.049
so you could be a part
of something pretty amazing

05:32.174 --> 05:34.251
if you just give us
our seats together.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.044
Thank you so much.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.379
- We're a family.
- Yeah.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.965
Sorry, that's all we have.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.074
Okay, we'll figure it out.

05:41.199 --> 05:42.409
No, you can't give up.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.161
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

05:44.286 --> 05:47.514
They always save a whole block
of seats for all the big shots.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.083
So, Sharon, the seats
that you were gonna give

05:50.208 --> 05:52.002
to Bono or to Wolf Blitzer,

05:52.127 --> 05:53.561
why don't you put your
fingertips on that keyboard

05:53.727 --> 05:55.339
and clickity-clackity,
clickity-clackity,

05:55.464 --> 05:56.557
chicka, chicka, chicka, chicka, okay?

05:56.682 --> 05:57.649
All right, well,
let's not make a scene

05:57.883 --> 05:58.926
about people's fingernails.

05:59.051 --> 06:00.068
No, we're on a mission, honey, here.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.345
We are heroes.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.096
And the least that I deserve

06:03.221 --> 06:05.232
is a courtesy clickity-clackity.

06:05.357 --> 06:07.951
So clack away.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.619
Enjoy your flight.

06:09.785 --> 06:11.355
Oh, we will, Sharon.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.039
You might be a roadblock, my dear,

06:13.205 --> 06:14.608
but you're not gonna break me.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.251
Oh, no, you're not.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.585
Excuse me.

06:17.751 --> 06:19.363
Oh, whoops, that's easier.

06:19.488 --> 06:20.531
Thank you.
I'll get it.

06:20.656 --> 06:21.898
That's not a roadblock for me.

06:22.023 --> 06:24.284
Neither is that.
Okay?

06:24.409 --> 06:25.669
We're good here.

06:25.794 --> 06:28.238
- Let's not do the whole row.
- Let's go, hon.

06:28.363 --> 06:30.081
Thank you!

06:31.739 --> 06:33.084
So as your minister,

06:33.209 --> 06:34.894
how do you want me to play
my part of the ceremony?

06:35.060 --> 06:36.688
Do you want heartfelt laughter?

06:36.854 --> 06:37.894
Tears?

06:38.019 --> 06:40.025
How nude do you want
the emotion to be?

06:40.191 --> 06:42.402
See-through blouse, no bottoms.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.779
I'm glad we talked.

06:44.945 --> 06:46.136
Got the keys.

06:46.261 --> 06:48.616
Oh, my God, is this Kevin?

06:48.782 --> 06:51.541
Yummy, Ava.
He's the total package.

06:51.666 --> 06:53.288
I hear wedding bells.

06:53.454 --> 06:56.124
Wedding bells?
Chill out, bitch.

06:56.290 --> 07:01.087
So my own personal
sound LLC reunion, huh?

07:01.253 --> 07:03.253
We're real fans in our house.

07:03.378 --> 07:05.622
My daughter and I,
we lo <i>baby back it up,</i>

07:05.747 --> 07:08.011
parenthesis, <i>into my face.</i>

07:08.177 --> 07:11.394
Huge.

07:11.519 --> 07:13.683
We will never sing that song again.

07:13.849 --> 07:15.060
Never, ever.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.187
Don't talk about it.
That song is dead.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.396
Don't say that.

07:18.562 --> 07:20.203
As everyone knows,

07:20.328 --> 07:23.401
we are considered the Lennon
and McCartney of hip-hop.

07:23.567 --> 07:27.877
John Lennon and Paul McCartney?

07:28.002 --> 07:29.362
We shared credit on all our songs,

07:29.487 --> 07:31.114
but on our biggest hit
there's been some

07:31.239 --> 07:32.982
unfortunate jive-assery
where some fool

07:33.107 --> 07:35.038
is spreading a rumor that
I didn't help write it.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.453
I woke up in the middle of the night

07:36.578 --> 07:39.375
with the words "back it up"
fully formed in my head.

07:39.541 --> 07:40.668
I picked up my keytar,

07:40.834 --> 07:44.194
and after eight minutes
I had the entire song penned

07:44.319 --> 07:45.465
with bridge.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.759
Who came up with
the beep-beeps, a ghost?

07:47.925 --> 07:48.968
Okay.

07:49.134 --> 07:50.845
- Hey.
- Yeah, cheers.

07:51.011 --> 07:52.202
Yeah.

07:52.327 --> 07:54.766
What is it about that song
that gets us fighting?

07:54.932 --> 07:58.394
God, we really are the Simon
and Garfunkel of hip-hop.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.022
Everyone always says that.

08:01.188 --> 08:02.679
Got 'em.

08:02.804 --> 08:04.347
Rocket fuel.

08:04.472 --> 08:05.882
Saving so much time,
we can get one of those

08:06.007 --> 08:07.817
awkward in-public massages.

08:07.942 --> 08:09.986
Oh, no.
Group travelers, incoming.

08:10.111 --> 08:11.821
Oh, listen, if we book it
we can beat them.

08:11.946 --> 08:13.556
Yeah, well, we've got to get
rid of our coffees real quick

08:13.681 --> 08:15.525
because they won't let us go
through security with them.

08:15.650 --> 08:17.059
- Mm!
- Oh, God!

08:17.184 --> 08:18.778
- Oh, my God!
- My mouth roof skin is gone.

08:18.903 --> 08:20.458
Ooh!

08:20.624 --> 08:22.082
♪ What are we talking about

08:22.207 --> 08:23.920
♪ what am I talking about

08:24.086 --> 08:25.839
whoa, end of the line is that way.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.633
- The what is?
- The line.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.177
Wow.

08:34.302 --> 08:37.642
Mr. and Mrs.
Kevin Alexander.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.104
Why do people at weddings
jump to conclusions like that?

08:41.270 --> 08:42.751
I don't know.

08:42.876 --> 08:45.445
I find it so uncomfortable.

08:47.715 --> 08:49.946
But don't worry,
marriage is not on my mind.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.489
Me either.

08:51.655 --> 08:53.263
I'm so glad we're on
the same page about this.

08:53.388 --> 08:54.981
Marriage, not for me.

08:55.106 --> 08:56.369
Nuh-uh.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.369
I mean, I'm definitely
never getting married again.

08:59.494 --> 09:01.541
Once was enough.
Never again.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.543
Never, never, never, ever.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.608
Never, never, never.

09:05.733 --> 09:08.006
Never, ever, period.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.966
Never, ever.

[Amy crying]

09:13.625 --> 09:14.784
All right, well, great.

09:14.909 --> 09:16.139
This bottle's supposed
to be post-security.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.516
So now our schedule
is completely out of whack.

09:18.682 --> 09:19.956
You know what though,
while we're waiting

09:20.081 --> 09:21.853
I can work on some of my
wedding toast ideas.

09:22.019 --> 09:22.976
You know what, honey,

09:23.101 --> 09:24.814
just be your normal adorable self.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.146
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.

09:26.271 --> 09:27.397
I was just thinking that I might end

09:27.522 --> 09:29.694
with one of my signature
dead-on impressions.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.613
Yeah.

[As Beetlejuice]
Well, you two are a couple of spooks.

09:35.647 --> 09:38.077
Let's turn on the juice
and see what shakes loose.

09:38.780 --> 09:40.378
It's showtime.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.365
It's Beetlejuice.

09:45.490 --> 09:47.337
It's Michael K...
Michael Keaton.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.452
Do you remember Michael Keaton?

09:49.577 --> 09:51.187
Yeah, honey, if you have
to name the character

09:51.312 --> 09:52.956
and the actor who played
that character,

09:53.081 --> 09:54.624
I think you have a bit of a problem.

09:54.749 --> 09:56.543
I got it.

09:56.668 --> 09:58.598
- Do you smell poop?
- Yeah, totally.

09:58.764 --> 09:59.846
Smelled it a long time ago actually.

09:59.971 --> 10:01.764
What? Why didn't you say something?

10:01.889 --> 10:05.768
- Because I'm in denial.
- Oh, my God.

10:05.893 --> 10:08.525
My baby, she needs to be changed.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.818
Probably thought my wife
cut one, huh?

10:10.984 --> 10:13.526
I'm just... humor.

10:13.651 --> 10:16.613
Well, we have to change her.
What are we gonna do?

10:16.738 --> 10:18.618
You know what, I got it, I got it.

10:18.784 --> 10:19.866
Excuse me, sorry.

10:19.991 --> 10:21.996
Excuse me, can you pass me
one of those gray bins?

10:22.162 --> 10:23.623
Yeah, thanks.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.501
Appreciate it.
Teamwork, right?

10:26.667 --> 10:27.824
What?

10:27.949 --> 10:29.545
Oh, come on, relax, you guys.

10:29.711 --> 10:31.839
Just a little baby poop.

10:32.005 --> 10:33.162
It's cute.

10:33.287 --> 10:35.593
It's not like some
man-sized Duke bomb.

- No, Kevin.

10:47.185 --> 10:48.428
He just told me.

10:48.553 --> 10:50.563
He said he never wants
to get married again.

Never, ever, ever.
Period.

- He hates minibars.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.504
And he doesn't want to get married.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.924
But, Ava, I thought that's
what you wanted.

11:15.090 --> 11:16.306
Well, I did too.

11:16.431 --> 11:18.207
But in my mind, it was never,

that are sitting there

I hate it all,
whether it's rational or not

and I have your back.

You're gonna make this
ceremony amazing.

and prince what's-his-teeth.

of time and money.

we were on the same page.

of my ex-wife.

changes things, you know?

this experience for you.

when we get a chance, okay?

let me just take her.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.355
Of course, on my last shift

15:54.480 --> 15:57.164
there'd be a cranky baby
on the flight.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.777
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Do you mind?

15:59.902 --> 16:01.229
Okay, you don't have
to huff and puff at me.

16:01.354 --> 16:03.713
Hey, airplane people, can
I have your attention, please?

16:03.879 --> 16:07.568
That is my wife, and that
is my little baby girl.

16:07.693 --> 16:08.970
And I ask you to please be patient

16:09.095 --> 16:11.873
with my little baby girl
'cause she's just a baby.

16:11.998 --> 16:13.848
And my wife has had
a really tough day.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.127
And she's way out
of her comfort zone,

16:16.252 --> 16:18.060
but she's handling it like a champ.

16:18.226 --> 16:21.063
So if you have a problem with them,

16:21.229 --> 16:22.817
you've got a problem with me.

16:22.942 --> 16:24.635
But if you're cool,

16:24.760 --> 16:26.861
beers and bloodies
are on me, all right?

16:27.027 --> 16:29.071
Okay, and just one each.

16:29.237 --> 16:31.616
And only domestic beer.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.701
Dude, put your hand down.
You're, like, 12 years old.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.954
[Mouths words]

16:42.445 --> 16:44.405

16:44.530 --> 16:46.531
Always.

16:49.035 --> 16:50.968
You know, I think we're
doing pretty good.

16:51.134 --> 16:52.446
I know, right?

16:52.571 --> 16:55.556
Suck it, gene and Terry.

16:55.722 --> 16:56.801
You know what would really get them?

16:56.926 --> 17:00.354
- Hmm?
- Mile high club.

17:00.479 --> 17:02.456
Honey, we can't do that.

17:02.581 --> 17:03.898
We have the baby.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.227
I don't wanna get lavatory
on my good boots.

17:06.352 --> 17:07.979
Really? Really?

17:08.104 --> 17:10.231
We're not gonna actually do it.

17:10.356 --> 17:11.648
- Oh, okay.
- We're just gonna...

17:11.773 --> 17:13.866
Oh, oh, okay.
Hold on.

All right, let's get another one.
