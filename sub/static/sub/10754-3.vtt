00:09.384 --> 00:11.428
(Fire alarm beeps)

00:11.595 --> 00:15.307
Oh, my God! Fire, fire!

00:15.557 --> 00:18.894
Eddie, where are you, boy?

00:19.061 --> 00:22.397
- Dad, wake up! Are you in there?
- Here, Eddie!

00:22.564 --> 00:24.608
Dad, where are you?

00:24.775 --> 00:28.403
- Have you seen Eddie?
- No! Where is the fire?

00:29.655 --> 00:32.783
It's all right! False alarm!

00:32.950 --> 00:35.202
The one over my bed went off.

00:35.410 --> 00:39.706
- Thank God.
- And Eddie's back in my room.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.792
The noise it makes!

00:41.959 --> 00:45.420
It would be less upsetting
to wake up on fire.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.091
- What triggered it?
- Who knows?

00:49.258 --> 00:53.595
I was dozing when it started
screaming away for no reason.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.184
I see. What have we here?

00:59.434 --> 01:03.272
Eddie, you've been smoking
in Daphne's room! Bad dog!

01:04.105 --> 01:08.026
I know you have
a no-smoking rule. I'm sorry.

01:08.193 --> 01:13.615
Every now and again, I feel a bit tense
and I find a ciggy can be soothing.

01:13.866 --> 01:18.829
Real soothing! It should be an hour
until my heart stops fibrillating.

01:20.289 --> 01:25.169
It figures. 3:00 am, on the night
before I have an early meeting.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.173
Aren't you going back to bed?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.550
No. I'll just sit up for a bit.

01:31.717 --> 01:35.929
- I'm feeling a bit blue.
- Anything you'd like to talk about?

01:36.096 --> 01:40.017
No. You need your sleep.
It's nothing important.

01:40.184 --> 01:43.145
Just that my life's a gaping sinkhole

01:43.312 --> 01:48.150
and I'm marking time while
the flower of my youth rots on the vine.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.321
Well, so long as you're sure.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.912
I really wish you'd tell me about it.

02:00.704 --> 02:06.251
- lf you must know, it's my love life.
- Really? Have you been seeing a man?

02:06.460 --> 02:10.130
Only when I close my eyes
and concentrate.

02:12.049 --> 02:16.053
- Going through a bit of a drought?
- Small wonder.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.765
The rare times I do go out,
it's with your father.

02:19.932 --> 02:23.852
People assume
I'm his daughter or his girlfriend.

02:24.102 --> 02:28.565
Either way, it's like having
a personal can of stud repellent.

02:29.775 --> 02:34.780
I know how bleak these times can be,
but they end sooner or later.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.825
I remember a time when
I was going through the same.

02:39.076 --> 02:42.621
Just a week later,
I met a lovely barmaid.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.791
Sophisticated, if a bit loquacious.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.878
We fell madly in love.
We got engaged.

02:51.088 --> 02:56.301
She left me standing at the altar
but the point is, I didn't give up.

02:56.468 --> 03:00.514
I took my poor, battered heart
and offered it to Lilith.

03:03.559 --> 03:07.688
Put it in her food processor
and hit the purée button.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.442
I rebounded,
and look how far I've come.

03:13.193 --> 03:17.906
I'm divorced, lonely...
living with my father.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.074

03:33.547 --> 03:38.051
You missed your meeting
with the new station manager.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.679
Oh, no! I completely forgot.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.975
You look like you've been
ridden hard and put away wet.

03:45.184 --> 03:50.105
I was up with Daphne, competing to
see whose love life was more pathetic.

03:50.314 --> 03:53.317
On the bright side, I won.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.737
I know what your problems are.
What are hers?

03:56.904 --> 03:59.990
She's just having trouble
finding men.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.994
- Say no more.
- No, Roz, please.

04:04.203 --> 04:07.539
You do not have to donate
one of your boyfriends.

04:08.248 --> 04:12.211
- I'd be happy to.
- One hates to break up a collection.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.175
Triple espresso and my mocha latte.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.345
- Does that chocolate look different?
- No.

04:21.595 --> 04:25.849
I think they've switched
to an inferior domestic brand.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.523
Waxy.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.277
- Sven Bachman, an aerobics coach.
- No.

04:37.486 --> 04:42.658
This one's perfect. Günther Dietrich.
He's loads of fun and he's a model.

04:42.866 --> 04:46.370
A German narcissist.
Appealing combination.

04:48.372 --> 04:51.083
- OK. I'll keep looking.
- For what?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.669
A man for Daphne.

04:58.924 --> 05:01.301
- What?
- Here we go.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.555
He's a tennis instructor called Brick.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.392
Dear God, Frasier!
Sven, Günther, Brick?

05:08.559 --> 05:14.314
Why not just soak Daphne in baby oil
and hurl her over the prison wall?

05:18.944 --> 05:20.988
I've dated all these guys.

05:21.154 --> 05:25.075
Where do you think
I came up with the imagery?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.787
Listen, you little titmouse...

05:28.954 --> 05:33.167
Niles, you are out of line here.
And, Roz, he does have a point.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.794
You and Daphne are different.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.881
Daphne is very shy and inexperienced.

05:39.089 --> 05:43.343
You are... You'd be hard-pressed
to find anyone who's more...

05:43.510 --> 05:48.640
No one I've dated is good enough for
her. Is that what you're trying to say?

05:48.849 --> 05:52.186
No.
That's what I'm trying not to say.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.646
- I'm out of here.
- Wait!

05:54.813 --> 05:57.649
No, I can't stay!
The fleet is in!

06:01.945 --> 06:03.989
(High-pitched electronic whine)

06:11.705 --> 06:16.668
And this concludes our test
of the emergency broadcast system.

06:17.211 --> 06:21.757
In a real emergency, your radio
would be melting in your hands.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.514
We'll be right back
after these messages.

06:29.181 --> 06:33.435
In future, please keep
your half-eaten food off my console.

06:33.602 --> 06:38.065
- In fact, stay out of my sight.
- You're still mad. I can tell.

06:38.232 --> 06:43.111
There's that sensitivity that keeps
you in such demand with the ladies.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.533
Roz, I'm sorry if I insulted you,

06:47.699 --> 06:50.869
but I feel very protective
about Daphne.

06:51.036 --> 06:55.332
The man I'm looking for
has to be good-looking, smart...

06:55.541 --> 06:57.835
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

06:58.085 --> 07:02.047
- I'm Tom Duran, the new manager.
- Pleasure to meet you.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.425
Sorry about the meeting.
I slept through it.

07:05.592 --> 07:10.013
Yeah, me too, and I was there.
Say, that's a beautiful tie.

07:10.264 --> 07:15.227
I got this in London at one of
those custom shops off Sloane Square.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.897
I just came from London.
Five years with the BBC.

07:19.064 --> 07:23.735
Really? I love London.
The museums, the theatre.

07:23.986 --> 07:27.197
Yeah. I'm a big theatre buff.
I hated leaving.

07:27.406 --> 07:31.535
- Why did you?
- I just went through a messy break-up.

07:31.702 --> 07:35.497
I thought I'd sleep better
with a continent between us.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.833
Yes, I know the feeling.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.256
So...
I take it then you are unattached?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.634
Yes, but I haven't given up hope.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.929
- You may be in the right place.
- Really?

07:51.096 --> 07:52.431
Yes.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.184
- You're fond of the English?
- Yes.

07:55.392 --> 07:59.104
I have a weakness for people
who are a bit eccentric.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.398
- Really?
- 15 seconds.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.901
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.154
Tom, this may sound like short notice

08:07.362 --> 08:10.407
but if you're free Saturday,
come for dinner.

08:10.574 --> 08:13.118
- Thanks. I'd like that.
- Great!

08:15.245 --> 08:18.916
Hello, Seattle. We're back.
Roz, whom do we have next?

08:19.082 --> 08:21.460
(Roz) James from Tacoma on line one.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.171
Hello, James. I'm listening.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.966
- Hey, Roz.
- Hey, Tom.

08:28.133 --> 08:31.970
Every job I take,
word spreads like wildfire.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.556
- What's that?
- Oh, you know.

08:34.722 --> 08:39.227
Tell one or two people you're gay
and it's all over the station.

08:40.395 --> 08:44.775
Well, they don't call it broadcasting
for nothing.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.779
- He seems like a nice guy.
- He's OK.

08:48.946 --> 08:53.534
I hope he's more than OK.
He just asked me out on a date.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.584
- Frasier asked you out on a date?
- He asked me round for dinner.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.795
What's his favourite wine?

09:05.087 --> 09:07.172
- You should know...
- What?

09:09.758 --> 09:13.178
- He's nuts about Chardonnay.
- Thanks.

09:21.270 --> 09:25.315
Does he ask permission first?
No, he sets me up

09:25.482 --> 09:29.695
and I'm supposed to turn cartwheels
like I'm Cinderella.

09:30.362 --> 09:35.450
I told you, this is not a setup.
Tom doesn't even know you'll be here.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.412
Oh, an ambush, then.
Much nicer.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.624
My friends in Manchester
used to set me up.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.336
Always some gangly bounder
with a long reach

09:46.503 --> 09:49.965
and he wasn't going
for the Colman's mustard!

09:50.132 --> 09:54.178
Tom is just a co-worker
coming by for a pleasant dinner.

09:54.344 --> 09:58.265
lf some spark ignites, fine,
but there is no pressure.

09:58.432 --> 10:02.978
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Why? What's wrong with it?

10:03.145 --> 10:04.479
(Doorbell)

10:04.646 --> 10:06.690
What about something
with more oomph?

10:06.857 --> 10:09.735
What about that strapless number?

10:11.111 --> 10:14.907
Do you have any idea how
uncomfortable a strapless bra is?

10:15.073 --> 10:18.869
Thanks to my fraternity days,
as a matter of fact, I do.

10:23.665 --> 10:26.502
Tom, come in!
Good to see you.

10:26.668 --> 10:31.465
- I thought you'd like Chardonnay.
- Oh, my! That's my favourite.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.844
- Like the place?
- It's a hell of a view.

10:36.053 --> 10:39.139
It's even better from the bedroom.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.730
Why don't we just start
with a drink?

10:49.066 --> 10:53.445
- Four places. Who's joining us?
- Just my little household.

10:53.612 --> 10:57.032
My father and his physical therapist,
charming Daphne.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.576
You live with your dad?

10:59.743 --> 11:03.372
I can't imagine that.
It's great you get along,

11:03.539 --> 11:07.626
but doesn't having him here
kind of cramp your love life?

11:07.793 --> 11:12.881
Not at all. Except when I bring my
dates home, he tries to steal them.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.723
He's quite the old rascal.

11:22.641 --> 11:26.436
- Good evening.
- Oh, look who we have here!

11:27.938 --> 11:32.359
Tom, I'd like you to meet Daphne.
Daphne, this is Tom Duran.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.778
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise.

11:34.945 --> 11:38.532
Dr Crane, you didn't take his coat.
May I?

11:39.867 --> 11:43.579
(Inaudible)

11:46.498 --> 11:50.919
Ooh, this is strange! I'm picking up
a vibration from your coat.

11:51.086 --> 11:54.548
- Excuse me?
- She feels she has psychic powers.

11:54.715 --> 12:00.721
- You know those English eccentrics.
- You've just had a painful break-up.

12:00.888 --> 12:04.558
- Yes. You told her that!
- No.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.853
A bitter dispute
over opera recordings.

12:11.064 --> 12:15.819
Excuse me. I'll nip into the kitchen.
I have a bird to baste.

12:19.198 --> 12:23.368
- Quite something, huh?
- She's great! I love that accent!

12:23.535 --> 12:27.414
Frasier, I don't have to put a tie on
for this joker, do I?

12:31.001 --> 12:34.963
- Tom, my father, Martin Crane.
- Nice to meet you.

12:35.130 --> 12:40.385
Sorry about that "joker" business.
I call everybody joker. Or jerk.

12:40.552 --> 12:43.388
Pinhead. Bozo.

12:43.555 --> 12:47.184
Amazingly, he's free for dinner
on short notice.

12:47.351 --> 12:50.145
Why don't I just open this wine?

12:51.563 --> 12:54.274
- Well?
- Oh, he's a looker!

12:54.441 --> 12:56.485
I'm glad to have my lucky bra.

12:56.652 --> 13:00.072
He's worth every wire
digging into my rib cage.

13:00.239 --> 13:03.242
He thinks you're great, too.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.119
Oh, go on! Oh, God!

13:06.286 --> 13:09.790
Listen to me getting carried away
like a schoolgirl!

13:09.957 --> 13:12.584
No, I'm not raising my hopes tonight.

13:12.751 --> 13:15.462
Though I'm glad I raised my bosom.

13:15.629 --> 13:19.174
You'll love Seattle.
It's a real people place.

13:19.341 --> 13:22.636
- Good food, great bars.
- Any you recommend?

13:22.803 --> 13:26.807
I hang out at Duke's. Great crowd.
Lot of young cops.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.775
- You like football?
- Yeah! I missed it in London.

13:36.942 --> 13:41.488
We could see a game. Frasier hates it,
so it would just be us.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.575
Hey, Frasier warned me about you.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.621
Yeah, I guess I yell
at the players too loud.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.832
Here we are. Tom...

13:53.292 --> 13:56.295
Dad, I selected
a little vintage for you, too.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.047
I didn't bring the pull-tab
for you to sniff.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.592
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

14:01.758 --> 14:03.552
(Doorbell rings)

14:03.719 --> 14:05.762
Excuse me.

14:09.892 --> 14:13.228
- Oh, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier. Oh, thank you.

14:14.897 --> 14:19.902
- I'm just returning your book.
- Thank you. Don't let me keep you.

14:20.068 --> 14:24.573
- Am I interrupting something?
- I'm introducing a man to Daphne.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.409
- I guess you don't want me around.
- Thank you.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.370
How do you do?

14:32.122 --> 14:34.666
- I'm Dr Niles Crane.
- I'm Tom Duran.

14:34.833 --> 14:39.171
The bird's done. All I need
is strong arms to haul it out.

14:39.338 --> 14:42.174
I don't need to be asked twice.

14:50.349 --> 14:55.938
During the interview, her stomach
rumbles and her body mic picks it up.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.148
But what can I say?

14:58.315 --> 15:02.277
"Excuse me, would Her Majesty
care for a Tums?"

15:04.321 --> 15:08.700
I could listen to your stories
all night. They're so funny.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.620
And all involving bodily functions.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.336
Tom, I could use a little hand.

15:19.503 --> 15:23.674
No, Daphne. After all that cooking,
you must be strapless.

15:34.852 --> 15:38.730
- Niles, can I speak with you?
- Yes.

15:38.897 --> 15:42.442
- Did I do anything that offended you?
- No.

15:43.902 --> 15:49.199
It must be in my head. I sensed you
had a problem with me dating Frasier.

15:49.366 --> 15:52.077
Well, if you must know...

16:01.003 --> 16:03.714
I'm sorry, what was the question?

16:05.090 --> 16:09.136
Do you have a problem
with me dating your brother?

16:11.722 --> 16:13.348
No.

16:15.851 --> 16:19.688
Niles, I didn't ask Tom to dinner
so he could talk to you.

16:19.855 --> 16:23.400
There are others
who would like a crack at him.

16:36.788 --> 16:40.709
That Tom's a great guy.
You think maybe him and Daphne...?

16:44.880 --> 16:48.926
I can't remember when I last had
such a wonderful evening.

16:49.092 --> 16:53.388
We should thank you. I can't remember
when I've laughed so hard.

16:53.555 --> 16:57.100
(Raucous laughter)

17:00.312 --> 17:03.482
You've still got Mr Crane going.

17:03.649 --> 17:07.986
- Daphne, music might be appropriate.
- Good idea.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.992
She's quite a woman, isn't she?

17:14.159 --> 17:16.619
Yes, she's really something.

17:16.787 --> 17:19.915
- Frasier, I was wondering...
- Yes?

17:20.082 --> 17:25.212
Before the evening's over, could we
get a little one-on-one time?

17:25.378 --> 17:28.048
Ooh, I think I can arrange that.

17:33.679 --> 17:36.557
He says he wants
to be alone with you.

17:36.723 --> 17:41.603
This is my lucky bra! Keep the wine
flowing! I'll fix my lipstick!

17:41.770 --> 17:44.815
I guess I'd better
be hitting the old sack.

17:46.567 --> 17:50.195
I don't want to stand
in the way of young romance.

17:50.362 --> 17:52.406
- Thanks.
- Good night, Tom.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.284
Good night, Martin.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.912
- You should run along, too.
- Yes.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.915
And Frasier, I was wrong about Tom.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.419
lf I had to choose a man for Daphne,
I'd pick him.

18:05.586 --> 18:08.380
- Night, Tom. Nice to meet you.
- Night.

18:08.547 --> 18:11.300
Frasier, a word in your ear.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.387
Excuse me.

18:15.971 --> 18:20.934
I have to tell you something.
Dad wanted to, but I won the toss.

18:25.189 --> 18:28.025
- Yes?
- I had a little chat with Tom.

18:28.192 --> 18:33.739
He's interested in pursuing a romance
but his object is not Daphne.

18:33.906 --> 18:36.158
Damn that Roz!

18:36.325 --> 18:39.203
No, no. It's you.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.959
Me? That's impossible.
Tom's not gay.

18:46.126 --> 18:49.713
He seems to be
under that impression.

18:55.344 --> 18:59.223
What made him think...?
I just asked if he was attached.

18:59.389 --> 19:04.144
Then we talked about the theatre
and men's fashion... Oh, my God!

19:06.021 --> 19:10.692
- You realise what this means?
- Yes. You're dating your boss.

19:15.072 --> 19:20.160
You, of all people, should know
the pitfalls of an office relationship.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.539
But he didn't say...
He never mentioned...

19:23.705 --> 19:28.293
I'll call you tomorrow.
But not too early of course.

19:43.392 --> 19:45.018
So...

19:45.561 --> 19:47.479
So...

19:48.397 --> 19:50.983
God, I hate this song!

19:51.149 --> 19:56.321
I've broken my rule for you.
I usually don't date guys I work with.

19:56.488 --> 20:00.409
Yes, well, I've sort of
relaxed my rule for you, too.

20:10.043 --> 20:13.213
You're cute when you're nervous.

20:16.884 --> 20:19.511
I must be downright adorable now.

20:21.847 --> 20:28.395
Listen, Tom. I'm sorry, but we seem
to have gotten our lines crossed here.

20:30.063 --> 20:33.317
The truth is, I'm entirely straight.

20:34.151 --> 20:36.904
lf you're not interested,
just say so.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.156
No, it's true. I really am.

20:39.323 --> 20:44.244
I invited you because you seemed
so charming and you like the British.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.498
I thought you might be perfect
for Daphne.

20:47.664 --> 20:51.710
I can't believe this!
You had no idea that I'm gay?

21:03.555 --> 21:07.309
It never even occurred to me
that you might be gay.

21:07.476 --> 21:12.981
Well, it never even occurred
to me that you might be straight.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.067
Thank you.

21:16.944 --> 21:21.823
I feel just awful. It seems
I've just been leading you on all night.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.243
Oh, it's OK. Honest mistake.

21:24.409 --> 21:28.163
But I've made you think
you've found a man

21:28.372 --> 21:30.666
sensitive enough to help you...

21:30.833 --> 21:33.752
Frasier, I'll learn to love again.

21:34.419 --> 21:37.464
- Of course.
- You'll apologise to Daphne?

21:37.631 --> 21:40.676
For the rest of my days.

21:40.843 --> 21:43.387
Does this mean your dad's not gay?

21:46.098 --> 21:48.642
No, Dad's not gay.

21:49.685 --> 21:52.020
But Niles... Come on!

21:57.651 --> 22:00.571
No, I'm afraid not.

22:00.737 --> 22:03.824
So this Maris he kept mentioning
is a woman?

22:03.991 --> 22:06.952
Well, the jury's still out
on that one.

22:13.667 --> 22:18.505
# Hey baby, I hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:18.672 --> 22:20.674
# Oh, my!

22:20.841 --> 22:27.890
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:28.056 --> 22:33.896
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:34.062 --> 22:36.648
# They're calling again #

22:36.815 --> 22:39.443
Frasier has left the building.

22:40.305 --> 22:46.354
