00:17.560 --> 00:19.560
<i>Run, they are going to kill us!</i>

00:19.880 --> 00:21.120
Who are they?

00:21.200 --> 00:23.880
Stop or I'll shoot you!

00:23.960 --> 00:25.680
- Run!
- My glasses!

00:25.760 --> 00:27.680
- Get up!
- Stop or I'll shoot you!

00:28.560 --> 00:30.520
- My glasses!
- Stop!

00:31.960 --> 00:32.960
Wait!

00:39.400 --> 00:41.880
Stop right there. Get up.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.160
Stay there. Nice and easy.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.040
- Patrick, got her?
- Yes.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.240
Leave us alone. What do you want from us?

00:58.960 --> 01:00.960
- Grab their stuff.
- Yes.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.680
- Give me that. You can't have it!
- Put it down.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.160
Put it down. Put it down!

01:08.240 --> 01:09.760
No. Shoot me.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.400
Just shoot her.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.200
- Put it down.
- Then shoot me.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.000
There is no food in the bag.

01:17.720 --> 01:18.720
Put it down.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.560
Shoot her.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.200
I can show you where there's food.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.480
Okay, Jean, Lea. Let's go.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.600
She's lying.
We should just take their stuff.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.440
<i>We have made our way
into the headquarters in Sweden.</i>

01:57.520 --> 01:59.720
<i>Get up here now, no matter the cost.</i>

01:59.800 --> 02:01.000
<i>We must fix this...</i>

02:01.080 --> 02:02.520
He was told to go there.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.240
- Did you find it here?
- Yes.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.360
What did your dad do?

02:10.440 --> 02:12.560
He works for Apollon.

02:13.320 --> 02:14.440
Doing what?

02:15.600 --> 02:19.320
- Trying to save the world.
- Trying to save the world from here?

02:20.600 --> 02:23.880
- Well, that went well.
- They were working on a cure.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.520
But they didn't find one.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.440
- You can't know that.
- Yes, I can.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.800
We've heard those rumors a million times.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.560
And that message is six years old.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.480
But you haven't been there, have you?
Have you been to Sweden, to Apollon?

02:40.560 --> 02:45.880
No, but we've been to other places
that were allegedly better.

02:46.240 --> 02:50.600
Come with us or stay. We're going.
I want to know if our dad's alive.

02:50.680 --> 02:54.120
If your dad was alive, he wouldn't
have left you here for six years.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.880
You don't know squat about that.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.480
Okay.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.560
The only way to Sweden
is through Copenhagen,

03:07.640 --> 03:09.960
the only way out of Copenhagen
is the Long Bridge.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.120
- Okay.
- The other bridges were demolished.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.560
Why?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.720
To make control posts to restrain people
and contain the virus.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.360
Walk along the tracks.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.400
Steer clear of the Strangers
and other people.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.640
The few left in the city
will kill you for food.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.400
We'll stay here and survive.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.360
Pack your stuff.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.360
Simone, do you think
we can make it without them?

03:52.440 --> 03:53.520
Hey, of course.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.760
Come, let's go.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.960
The city is dangerous.
What if we meet people there?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.040
We just have to get through unnoticed.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.920
We'll reach the next bunker before dark.
We'll be safe there.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.080
I don't like it.

04:09.720 --> 04:14.440
I know, but we can make it, you and I.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.840
You're all talk, no serve.

04:56.920 --> 04:57.920
Yeah, yeah!

04:58.960 --> 05:03.320
- Oy. It's still on.
- Yeah.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.160
Where are the others?

05:08.640 --> 05:11.160
They left to find their dad in Sweden.

05:11.920 --> 05:12.920
- Ready?
- Yes.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.200
Their dad's in Sweden?

05:15.280 --> 05:16.280
Does it matter?

05:16.400 --> 05:19.400
But they shouldn't have gone without us.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.400
They won't make it on their own.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.840
They'll have to. We're not going.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.120
- Ready?
- Yes.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
What's up?

05:27.680 --> 05:30.760
Martin kicked out Rasmus and Simone.

05:30.840 --> 05:35.680
No, I didn't. People can do
what they want. Come on.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.920
- Where did they go?
- To Sweden.

05:38.440 --> 05:42.360
They think their dad's in Sweden
and that he can "save the world."

05:42.440 --> 05:44.160
- Come on.
- We're going with them.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.520
What?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.680
If their dad can save the world, we need
to help them find him, or they will die.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
So what?

05:51.280 --> 05:52.920
They helped us when we needed it.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.800
It's not just about surviving,
it's about hope. We're going with them.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.960
But it's really dangerous.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.360
- What is?
- Dangerous...

06:02.960 --> 06:04.920
We're not doing anything dangerous, right?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.600
Let's go. Pack your stuff.
We must find Simone and Rasmus.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.240
Come. Let's find the others.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.920
Are you there? Martin?

06:24.800 --> 06:25.800
Sit down.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.160
Weren't you hungry?

06:28.760 --> 06:30.600
We try to keep our distance.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.880
Particularly people who might be infected.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.640
You didn't mind stealing our stuff.
Nice guys.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.560
They don't have a chance of surviving.
We'll leave them early in the morning.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.320
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

06:47.760 --> 06:49.800
- Please dig in.
- Thank you.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.440
Where did you learn to cook?

06:56.120 --> 06:57.120
From my mom.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.840
Was she a chef?

07:00.080 --> 07:02.880
- Was that a stupid question?
- No. Tell us about your mom.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
Don't.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.160
Ask him what his name is.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.800
He's called Jan, right? Isn't it Jan?

07:11.600 --> 07:13.720
- What?
- His name is Jean.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.120
- Jan?
- Jean.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.360
- Sean?
- Jean!

07:17.440 --> 07:21.840
His mom named him after Jeanne d'Arc
because she hated men, right?

07:21.920 --> 07:26.160
Tell us about when she made you
wear a dress to school.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.200
- Stop, Lea.
- Sorry.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.800
You suck, Lea.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.240
Hey, who is this Jean Dark fella?

07:43.760 --> 07:47.080
It makes no sense to just walk out
on months' worth of food.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.160
They'll be knocking on the door soon,
begging to come back inside.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.560
Are you sure?

08:00.680 --> 08:02.960
Beatrice is so goddamn annoying!

08:31.800 --> 08:33.000
Shit, this is crazy.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.679
- It's completely destroyed.
- What the hell happened here?

08:37.720 --> 08:38.799
Look, what's that?

08:39.840 --> 08:41.400
Rasmus, don't go in there.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.240
Rasmus.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.920
Rasmus, let's go.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.520
Rasmus, someone's coming!

09:06.160 --> 09:08.000
Get down! We can't go out!

09:11.840 --> 09:13.040
Keep quiet.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.800
Having fun?

09:16.400 --> 09:17.440
Hi!

09:21.520 --> 09:22.520
Hi!

09:23.240 --> 09:24.720
What's going on?

09:24.800 --> 09:27.080
We're going with you. We believe in you.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.320
You're kind of a...
What did you call her?

09:29.400 --> 09:30.560
- A guiding star.
- Yes.

09:32.040 --> 09:36.520
- Lea believes in God.
- It has nothing to do with that.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.440
A guiding star is just someone
you want to follow.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.280
What about the others?

09:43.560 --> 09:48.120
They'll follow sooner or later when Martin
realizes we aren't coming back.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.040
Why are you all looking at me?

09:52.120 --> 09:53.600
Because you're in charge.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.320
What? No, I...
I'm not in charge of anyone.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.360
Then I'll be in charge.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.120
Perfect!

10:03.200 --> 10:04.200
Want me to drive?

10:14.960 --> 10:16.720
We are the champions!

10:31.800 --> 10:32.920
Is anyone hungry?

10:35.320 --> 10:38.480
- I'm always hungry.
- Come on, guys, we need to keep moving.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.240
What does she think is in Sweden?
Their dad? Apollon?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.800
What does Beatrice think
she'll get from joining them?

10:47.880 --> 10:50.320
Fuck them. We're better off without them.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.920
It's strange, don't you think?

10:53.920 --> 10:56.880
There's nothing left.
They're marching into death.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.520
We can't change that.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
Pack your things.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.680
What the fuck?

11:12.600 --> 11:17.800
- Can I taste your Chili Cheese Tops?
- What? I'm eating bunker food like you.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.640
This is Burger King.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.920
Okay, I'm eating a pizza
with shawarma, greens, and dressing.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.000
It has to be from Burger King.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.600
I'd rather have a pizza.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.920
Okay.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.560
We need to move on.
It's dangerous here in the city.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.280
There's a bunker in Amager.
We can spend the night there.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.840
Okay.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.160
- Where are you going?
- To get some new glasses.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.520
Is that okay?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.720
I haven't seen clearly for years
with these.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.120
Didn't you hear Simone?
It's dangerous here.

11:49.200 --> 11:53.360
If it starts raining, we'll be trapped.
You have five minutes.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.200
- That's fine.
- I'll join him,

11:55.280 --> 11:56.960
make sure he gets back here.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.840
Do you think Martin's looking for us?

12:03.080 --> 12:05.160
Whatever. I don't need him anymore.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.280
What are you doing?

13:49.160 --> 13:51.760
We're staying together, aren't we?

14:02.640 --> 14:04.760
What's so dangerous about the city anyway?

14:05.680 --> 14:07.800
There was a lot of food here at first...

14:08.200 --> 14:10.560
so people gathered here
and infected each other.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.160
Those that weren't infected were
so desperate they stole from each other.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.600
Now they're killing each other for food.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.960
People kinda suck.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.080
Fuck. They're hungry.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.480
Simone, we have to get out of here. Come!

14:30.560 --> 14:31.760
What about the others?

14:31.840 --> 14:33.840
- What's happening?
- Come on. Now!

14:37.000 --> 14:38.080
They're coming!

14:40.800 --> 14:41.800
Beatrice.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.680
Fuck.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.520
This way. We have to find Jean and Lea.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.240
Rasmus?

15:02.320 --> 15:03.320
Beatrice?

15:10.040 --> 15:12.560
How do I look
when you're not wearing glasses?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.560
- You look fine.
- Take them off.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.440
Go ahead.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.080
- Can you see my braces?
- Yes.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.160
No.

15:24.240 --> 15:28.600
Sure you can. How many fingers?

15:29.160 --> 15:30.760
- One.
- Yes.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.360
Lea, don't be so mean.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.760
Okay, let's have a look. Here.

15:38.840 --> 15:41.680
They look great. They're so you.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.240
Oh, dear. These would be great, too.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.800
Or these.

15:49.840 --> 15:50.840
Yes.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.800
Can you see okay?

15:55.880 --> 15:57.080
Yes, they're fine.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.520
Can you see me?

15:59.920 --> 16:00.840
- Yes.
- Can you?

16:00.920 --> 16:03.280
- Yes.
- That will be 1,000,000 kroner.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.120
- Do you take MobilePay?
- Yes.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.000
Then I need your number.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.800
Sure, you can have it.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
You can.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.160
We need to get back to the group.

16:20.800 --> 16:21.800
Rasmus!

16:22.360 --> 16:23.360
Rasmus!

16:24.960 --> 16:25.960
Beatrice!

16:27.400 --> 16:28.400
Rasmus!

16:53.040 --> 16:54.040
Rasmus!

16:55.400 --> 16:56.400
Rasmus!

17:05.599 --> 17:08.079
ANETTE IS MISSING

17:21.280 --> 17:25.440
WE'RE SEARCHING FOR JOSEPHINE.
DEEPLY MISSED.

17:30.680 --> 17:31.680
Hey.

17:32.600 --> 17:36.200
You shouldn't be here. It's dangerous.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.280
There's got to be someone
who's looking after you.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.240
- You go through a lot of shit for her.
- Who?

17:52.360 --> 17:53.360
Beatrice.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.480
- It was easier when it was just us.
- Whatever. Go on. Okay?

18:12.640 --> 18:15.600
- The rain's coming.
- We have to find Simone first.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.600
No, we must get inside now.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.920
I grew up right in there.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.880
- What?
- I was born in there.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.240
- My mother gave birth to me in there.
- Okay.

18:31.640 --> 18:32.640
Come.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.360
- But Simone is...
- No, hurry up before the rain starts.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.800
Hey, we have to get out of the rain.

18:47.680 --> 18:48.680
Come on.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.240
DENMARK IS IN QUARANTINE
GO SOUTH - NO HELP COMING

19:08.480 --> 19:10.280
I hope Simone made it inside.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.120
I'm sure she did.

19:32.760 --> 19:33.760
You lived here?

19:49.560 --> 19:51.800
Why haven't you been back
for all those years?

19:52.640 --> 19:54.040
I need to tell you something.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.320
I have a secret.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.440
My parents were getting a divorce.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.440
My dad had just told me.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.440
I didn't want to talk to them.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.440
I just took off to the movies.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.960
And when I came back out,
everything was gone.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.480
He'd been calling and leaving messages.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.560
In the first one,
he said my mom was sick...

20:25.600 --> 20:27.320
but that she'd be fine.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.600
In the next one,
he had started feeling sick, too.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.360
He didn't know what to do.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.720
He felt... strange.

20:40.800 --> 20:41.840
He told me...

20:44.240 --> 20:47.920
to take good care of myself
and never come back home.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.200
And in the final message...

20:56.160 --> 20:57.240
there was nothing.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.520
Only silence.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.200
It looks like they liked each other
in the end.

21:12.960 --> 21:13.960
They did.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.840
Where are your mom and dad?

21:26.320 --> 21:27.960
Are you all alone?

21:33.800 --> 21:34.920
What's that?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Nothing.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.120
May I see?

21:46.720 --> 21:47.840
Is it morphine?

21:49.440 --> 21:51.400
It makes my tummy stop hurting.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.920
You shouldn't be eating pills.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.480
You need food.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.160
This is much better for you.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.200
Hey! Hey, do you hear me?

22:11.280 --> 22:12.440
Let him go.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.280
I didn't do anything.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.360
Keep away from him.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.000
Keep away from my son.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.920
- Think the group made it inside?
- Yes, I hope so.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.640
Why haven't you thrown it away?

22:37.680 --> 22:40.000
I won't until I know what it does.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.120
What if it's a tracker?

22:43.200 --> 22:46.120
Then they'd have been here by now.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.720
Fucking...

22:54.080 --> 22:55.360
Fuck, man!

22:56.280 --> 22:58.240
- What's up?
- It's hash!

22:59.280 --> 23:01.480
- That's not hash.
- What is it then?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.720
I don't know, but it isn't hash.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.920
- It's shit.
- Nonsense.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.640
- You think it's shit?
- It's old shit.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.640
- You've never seen hash, that's why.
- It's six-year-old shit.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.800
You can actually eat it.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.880
Yuck! Gross!

23:25.360 --> 23:26.480
You're so stupid.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.400
What did you do?

23:31.280 --> 23:32.880
I just threw it.

23:39.960 --> 23:40.960
What's that?

23:42.240 --> 23:43.240
A map.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.360
- That looks like a wall.
- A wall?

23:49.240 --> 23:51.600
Fuck, we're in a quarantine zone.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.000
Has the rain stopped?

24:07.960 --> 24:09.960
No... Yes.

24:12.800 --> 24:13.800
Come.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.200
Let's go up.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.640
The view is awesome up here.
You can see everything.

24:41.320 --> 24:42.680
And no people in sight.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.200
Sometimes that's really nice.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.920
It would be better if you weren't here.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.360
Relax. It's irony.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.520
I don't understand.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.360
Well, you'll have to learn.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.480
- Say the opposite of what you mean.
- Why?

25:05.640 --> 25:06.640
Because.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.000
Because you're ugly?

25:19.240 --> 25:20.960
Come, let's find your sister.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.080
Why did you help him?

25:28.680 --> 25:30.000
He needed food.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.320
But it's not normal.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.480
Not here.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.000
I'm not from around here.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.000
Get out while you can.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.800
There's nothing but animals here.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.560
What do you mean? There are people here.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.560
No, it just looks that way.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.400
Then why are you still here?

25:54.640 --> 25:57.560
He's too weak to travel.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.880
I can't protect him.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.320
I wanted to cross the bridge with him.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.960
They say there's a doctor.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.640
A doctor?

26:09.720 --> 26:12.440
She's supposed to be in a place
called Little Bjärred.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.920
He might make it all the way
if he gets enough to eat.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.240
You are the first real human I've met.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.840
I don't know...

26:32.440 --> 26:33.520
Thank you.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.280
No need to say thanks.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.920
I must get back to my brother.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Come.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.360
- Food...
- We have food.

26:42.440 --> 26:43.440
Come on.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.520
Bye.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.320
- See this. Try it. Here.
- Is that food you have?

26:57.960 --> 27:01.400
- What? Answer me. Is that food you've got?
- Hurry away.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.720
We don't have anything.
Don't you touch him!

27:04.840 --> 27:06.840
- Don't! Stop.
- Let go!

27:06.920 --> 27:08.520
- Don't! No!
- Show it to me.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.320
- Don't!
- Give it to me! I need it!

27:15.040 --> 27:16.320
Help!

27:27.880 --> 27:29.520
We have to get out of the city, now!

27:30.800 --> 27:34.440
- Where's Rasmus?
- Hi, Simone. We were waiting for you.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.520
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Moron!

27:40.240 --> 27:44.720
- It's not funny. We can't stay here.
- Simone, what's going on?

27:44.800 --> 27:47.320
- Now! Hurry up!
- Simone, what's happened?

27:48.080 --> 27:50.760
Grab your bag. Put it on. Put the bag on.

27:50.840 --> 27:51.760
Come on.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.040
I fucking hate you.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.320
Give me your food.

27:56.040 --> 27:56.880
Now!

27:56.960 --> 27:58.960
- We can't spare any.
- Now!

27:59.480 --> 28:01.520
- Give him the bag.
- Martin says...

28:01.600 --> 28:02.440
Fuck him!

28:02.520 --> 28:04.600
Give it to him before more come.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.480
There's more in the next bunker.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.840
- Where is there more?
- Nowhere.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.000
Give him some from the bag!

28:12.960 --> 28:13.960
Hey.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.800
- Let him go!
- Okay...

28:18.000 --> 28:20.680
Now tell me where there's more food!

28:20.760 --> 28:22.240
Where is there more food?

28:24.040 --> 28:25.040
Please...

28:25.120 --> 28:26.120
Let him go.

28:26.840 --> 28:27.920
No.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.800
Where is there more food?

28:30.880 --> 28:32.720
- Let him go.
- Should I stab him?

28:32.800 --> 28:34.480
Let him go! Go on!

28:34.560 --> 28:36.640
Move away. Now.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.400
Step away.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.240
Rasmus, come here.

28:40.320 --> 28:44.280
Come. Step away. Come.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.520
I'm gonna count to three.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
One...

28:48.760 --> 28:49.760
two...

28:50.800 --> 28:51.800
three.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.360
No!

28:57.920 --> 28:58.920
Leave him!

28:59.000 --> 29:00.680
Martin, do something!

29:00.760 --> 29:02.400
Do something or he'll die!

29:02.480 --> 29:05.320
Focus! Breathe.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.960
Patrick, gauze! Hurry!

29:08.040 --> 29:09.880
- We're out.
- Give me the duct tape.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.960
Okay, breathe.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.680
We have to get out of here.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.120
There's a bunker in Amager.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.680
There is?

29:19.280 --> 29:21.040
Find something to transport him in.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.840
If you don't keep quiet,
more of them will come, so shut up!

29:47.160 --> 29:48.160
Is it here?

29:48.240 --> 29:49.960
- It's right here.
- Come on.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.120
It's right here.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.000
Fuck! Someone's been here!

30:05.560 --> 30:08.320
- Maybe they're still down there.
- I'll see if it's safe.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.280
I'm coming with you.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.600
Check there.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.120
Can you find anything?

30:24.840 --> 30:26.440
The medicine cabinet's empty.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.400
There's no one here.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Fuck.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.440
Come on! Bring him in there!

30:39.280 --> 30:41.840
- It hurts!
- Fuck!

30:41.920 --> 30:42.920
It hurts!

30:45.080 --> 30:46.440
He needs to shut up!

30:47.200 --> 30:49.200
We'll dress his wound and move on.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.280
What's that?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.640
Painkillers, I think.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.520
Where the hell did you get those?

30:54.600 --> 30:56.800
Rasmus, swallow this.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.400
It'll make you feel better.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.720
I'm dressing your wound, Rasmus.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.320
Press here. Press.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.920
There, there. Easy, Rasmus.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.920
It'll be fine.

31:22.360 --> 31:26.280
I'm sorry, Rasmus. It was stupid
to leave without the others.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.000
Good thing he has you.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.360
I'm not so sure.

31:36.880 --> 31:39.680
I am. I had a little sister.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.680
I'll stay with him.
You should get some sleep.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.400
Thank you.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.600
I'll look after you.
We're in this together.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.680
Patrick and I will continue
without you guys.

32:27.720 --> 32:31.880
- It's safer to travel in small groups.
- But I thought we were together now.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.480
I have a secret.

32:42.480 --> 32:43.760
I grew up down there.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.600
- Seriously?
- I was born there.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.040
My mom had me in there.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.280
That's crazy. Want to have a look?

33:00.360 --> 33:02.400
No. I haven't been there
since the rain came.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.480
My mom saved me.

33:09.480 --> 33:12.040
She told me to stay indoors
and not go out.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.360
I saw them die.

33:15.840 --> 33:16.840
Your parents?

33:19.040 --> 33:20.280
And my little sister.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.320
I'm sorry.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.920
I took care of myself,
then I met Jean and Lea.

33:31.560 --> 33:33.480
It's better to travel together than alone.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.440
Right?

33:36.280 --> 33:38.400
Are the two of us moving on, Martin?

33:39.960 --> 33:40.960
Yes.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.640
But they're coming with us.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.400
Would you like that?

33:49.760 --> 33:50.960
You'll look after us?

33:53.320 --> 33:54.440
You're with us now.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.560
That way?

34:08.520 --> 34:10.400
There's a doctor.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.480
Where?

34:12.400 --> 34:15.080
Lilla Bjärred or something.
Just across the bridge.

34:15.159 --> 34:17.280
We must get him there. Will you help me?

34:18.280 --> 34:20.719
I need to show you something first.

34:26.199 --> 34:30.239
- What's that?
- A map of a quarantine zone.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.880
A new quarantine zone.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.199
Look.

34:35.400 --> 34:39.639
We got a map of Denmark
when the rain came,

34:40.120 --> 34:42.960
divided into the zones I told you about.

34:43.040 --> 34:47.520
When they broke down, we thought
the virus spread throughout the world.

34:47.600 --> 34:48.600
But look.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.080
That thing right there...

34:52.960 --> 34:53.880
I think it's a wall.

34:53.960 --> 34:57.000
What do you mean "wall"?

34:57.080 --> 34:59.120
I think we've been walled in.

35:00.360 --> 35:05.040
I think we're in a quarantine zone,
and that means they've stopped the virus.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.000
Why else build a wall?

35:07.720 --> 35:10.000
There must be life
on the other side of that wall.

35:10.960 --> 35:11.960
Right?

35:12.280 --> 35:13.640
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.000
That's where you want to go.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.040
And we'll join you.

35:23.640 --> 35:24.640
Thank you.
