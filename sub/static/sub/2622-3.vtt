WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:05.713
Hey. We are so in luck.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.465
Treeger said we could have
all this cool stuff from the basement.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.509
Wait right there.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.095
Oh, no, no. I'm paddling away.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.931
Huh?

00:16.099 --> 00:19.643
Wow. Really?
We got all this rusty crap for free?

00:21.104 --> 00:23.856
Uh-huh.
This and a bunch of bubble wrap...

00:24.024 --> 00:26.316
...and some of it is not even popped.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.909
Could we be more white trash?

01:26.711 --> 01:28.754
How desperate am I?

01:29.005 --> 01:32.257
Oh, good thing Chandler's not here.
He always wins at this game.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.469
I just told my mom
I'd cater her party for her.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.138
- How come?
- Because I need the money.

01:38.306 --> 01:42.810
And I thought it'd be a great way to get rid
of that last little smidgen of self-respect.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.937
Come on, I think this is a good thing.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.688
I don't think Mom would've hired you...

01:46.856 --> 01:48.857
...if she didn't think you were good
at what you do.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.444
You don't have to stick up for her.
She can't hear you.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.032
Hey, um, do you guys have any juice?

01:57.200 --> 01:58.575
Just pickle.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.703
Hey, uh, Rach. Funny story.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.789
I bumped into Joanna
on the street yesterday.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.543
My boss, Joanna?
Wow, that must have been awkward.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.419
Well, no. Actually, she asked me
if I wanted to get a drink.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.134
You, uh, didn't say yes to that, did you?

02:15.301 --> 02:18.554
Ha, ha. No. No.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.347
Hello, Rachel.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.103
Well, not at first.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.273
What is she doing here?

02:35.113 --> 02:36.238
I don't understand.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.574
Last time you went out with her,
you said she was a dud.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.200
I think I judged her too quickly.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.579
And this time, we were able
to take the relationship to the next level.

02:46.749 --> 02:51.378
Well, last time, I almost got fired.
You must end it. You must end it now.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.922
It's not like this is an everyday occurrence
for me.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.466
I mean, usually I'm pretty much
in there by myself.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.973
Chandler.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.893
Promise me you will end it.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.897
- Okay. I promise I'll end it.
- Thank you.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.899
But I hope you know
what I'm giving up for you.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.484
Because she's not just the boss
in your office.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.153
You know what I mean?

03:16.487 --> 03:17.779
Yeah.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.492
Oh, sorry. I knew what he meant.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.875
How's the hired help?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.502
Doing great. Quiches are coming along.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.796
What's this? Blue nail polish?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.758
Yeah, I thought it was cute.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.386
Ha. It's what your grandmother's hands
looked like when we found her.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.516
Let me ask you a question.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.185
Why did you hire me?

03:48.353 --> 03:51.396
Oh, well, Richard raved
about the food at his party...

03:51.564 --> 03:53.315
...of course, you were sleeping with him.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.860
Then I heard the food at that
lesbian wedding was very nice.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.947
I assume you weren't sleeping
with anyone there.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.491
Though,
at least that would be something.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.037
Oh, my God. Did you hear that?

04:07.205 --> 04:09.706
She hired me because
she thinks I'm good.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.502
Okay, I didn't hear that.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.255
Yeah. She didn't hire me out of pity.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.675
It wasn't so she could pick on me
in front of her friends.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.593
She actually thinks I'm good.

04:21.761 --> 04:25.347
Wow. And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian.
Ha, ha.

04:40.738 --> 04:44.032
Good afternoon. Are you
the decision-maker of the house?

04:44.575 --> 04:45.951
Uh...

04:50.248 --> 04:53.417
Do you, uh, currently own
a set of encyclopedias?

04:53.584 --> 04:57.546
No, no, but, uh, try the classifieds.
People sell everything in there.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.674
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.718
Let me ask you one question.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.721
Do your friends ever have
a conversation...

05:05.888 --> 05:07.389
...and you just nod along...

05:07.557 --> 05:10.434
...even though you're not really sure
what they're talking about?

05:15.815 --> 05:18.233
I'm telling you,
it's totally unconstitutional.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.652
- I hear you. Yeah it is.
- I totally agree.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.448
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.408
No.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.246
It was like the Algonquin kids' table.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.960
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.671
You haven't said anything
for about two and a half minutes.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.090
Are you at all interested?

05:42.383 --> 05:45.761
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah. Come on in.
Come on.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.349
- That's weird.
- What?

05:50.516 --> 05:51.641
Your nails.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.226
Oh, I know. I never wear fake ones.

05:53.394 --> 05:56.188
I just did it so my mom wouldn't
give me grief about biting them.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.566
No, I meant it's weird that
you only have nine now.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.112
Oh, my God.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.615
Wait a minute.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.575
I had them when I put...

06:08.743 --> 06:10.494
Oh, my God. It's in the quiche.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.830
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, don't panic.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.208
I'm gonna go to the store,
get you another set of nails.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.252
No one is gonna know,
and you're gonna look great.

06:20.963 --> 06:24.466
Oh. Oh, it's because they're gonna eat...
That's the problem.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.928
Honey, don't bite your nails.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.974
Okay, uh, please don't freak out.

06:33.142 --> 06:37.145
Um, but there's a blue fingernail
in one of the quiche cups.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.731
And there's no way to know which one.

06:42.026 --> 06:45.612
And whoever finds it wins the prize.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.323
Ha, ha. I'm not freaking out.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.658
Why are you laughing?

06:49.826 --> 06:52.202
It's nothing. It's just that now
your father owes me $5.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.371
Ha, ha. What, you bet I'd lose a nail?

06:54.539 --> 06:57.999
Oh, no, don't be silly.
I just bet that I'd need these.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.918
- Frozen lasagnas?
- Mm.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.089
You bet that I'd screw up?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.842
So all that stuff about hiring me
because I was good was...

07:07.009 --> 07:08.552
No, that was all true.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.513
This was just in case you
pulled a Monica.

07:12.056 --> 07:15.684
You promised Dr. Weinberg
you'd never use that phrase.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.186
Honey, come on. Have a sense of humor.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.397
You're never able to laugh at yourself.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.691
That's right. Ha, ha.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.777
My mom doesn't have any faith in me.
Oh, that's hilarious.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.656
I don't get it.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.826
No. I have faith.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.120
No. You have lasagnas.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.171
Oh, the ruined quiches are ready.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.849
It just doesn't feel
like we're breaking up.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.769
No, we are. I'm sad.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.564
Okay.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.902
Yes?

08:07.612 --> 08:10.489
Uh, can you wait till tomorrow? All right.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.700
Unbelievable.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.785
Thanks.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.206
No, no. That was my boss. I have to go.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.957
Okay.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.584
What are you doing?

08:22.752 --> 08:24.586
- I'm getting dressed.
- Why?

08:25.254 --> 08:28.131
When I walk outside naked,
people throw garbage at me.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.468
Wait. I want to show you something.

08:32.135 --> 08:33.636
What is it?

08:33.804 --> 08:36.264
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.099
Put your hands together.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.977
You're not the boss of me.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.815
Yeah, you are.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.612
Hmm. Saucy.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.827
I'll be back in two minutes.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.331
You're, uh...?
You're going to leave me like this?

09:01.499 --> 09:05.460
Knowing you're here waiting for me,
I think that's kind of exciting, don't you?

09:05.628 --> 09:07.963
Okay, but if you don't come back soon...

09:09.298 --> 09:12.008
...there's pretty much nothing
I can do about it.

09:14.428 --> 09:17.472
- Oh.
- Hi. I brought you back a macaroon.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.475
Oh, great. I'll keep it in my butt
with your nose.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.651
That's weird. She locked the door.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.029
You know why?
She's got the Christmas bonus list in there.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.906
I saw her working on it this morning.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.993
Okay, swear you won't tell.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.620
But when Mark left,
he gave me a key to Joanna's office.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.582
- You want to see the list?
- Yeah.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.135
Hi.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.263
How are you?

10:21.203 --> 10:23.163
Hello, Joanna...

10:26.459 --> 10:28.376
-'s office.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.213
I'm sorry. I may be a little longer.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.008
- How little?
- A couple hours. I feel awful.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.510
Look, this isn't funny.
You get back here now.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.970
- I can't.
- Why not?

10:39.138 --> 10:40.930
I'm in my boss' car.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.016
- What?
- Uh-oh, tunnel.

11:00.576 --> 11:01.660
What?

11:01.827 --> 11:04.663
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?

11:11.879 --> 11:14.422
Okay, here's the situation. Ahem.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.966
The keys to the cuffs
are on the back of the door.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.551
Could you be a doll...

11:18.719 --> 11:22.055
...and grab them and scoot on over here
and unlock me?

11:23.307 --> 11:26.893
And on a totally separate subject,
that is a lovely pantsuit.

11:29.313 --> 11:32.315
You promised you would
break up with her.

11:32.483 --> 11:36.653
I did break up with her.
She just took it really, really well.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.450
And the fact that you were jeopardizing
my career never entered your mind?

11:42.618 --> 11:44.035
It did enter my mind.

11:44.203 --> 11:48.206
But then something happened
that made it shoot right out.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.875
You know what, Chandler?

11:51.043 --> 11:54.129
You got yourself into those cuffs,
you get yourself out them.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.882
No, no, no.
I can't get myself right out of them.

11:58.050 --> 12:01.136
You must have me confused
with the Amazing Chandler.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.722
Come on, you have to unlock me.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.433
She could be gone for hours,
and I'm cold and...

12:08.978 --> 12:11.813
Ugh! Chandler. All right. This is it.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.481
You never see Joanna again.

12:13.858 --> 12:14.899
Never.

12:15.067 --> 12:18.236
- You never come into this office again.
- Fine.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.156
- You give me back my Walkman.
- I...

12:22.575 --> 12:24.075
I never borrowed your Walkman.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.911
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.790
You got it. Here we go.
Come on. This is great.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.544
- Aw.
- Does it hurt?

12:35.087 --> 12:38.965
No, I just always see guys doing this
when they get handcuffs taken off.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.511
Hello, sweet pants.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.681
Wait a minute.
What are you gonna tell Joanna?

12:47.600 --> 12:48.683
About what?

12:48.851 --> 12:52.854
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna
know I let you out and I'm gonna get fired.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.190
I'll make something up.
I'm good at lying.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.150
I actually did borrow your Walkman.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.737
No, there's nothing to make up.
She's gonna know I have a key to her office.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.947
I've gotta get you locked
back the way you were.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.658
Oh, I don't think so.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.338
Well, this is much better.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.802
So here's somebody interesting, Joey.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.387
What do you know about Van Gogh?

13:26.555 --> 13:29.140
- Uh, he cut off his ear.
- And?

13:29.725 --> 13:31.184
I'm out.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.394
He painted that.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.523
Wow. That's pretty nice.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.567
I thought he cut off his ear
because he sucked.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.695
- What else you got in there?
- Let's see, uh...

13:43.113 --> 13:45.490
- Where does the Pope live?
- In the woods.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.828
Wait, wait, that's the joke answer.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.831
Actually, it's Vatican City.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.668
Now, uh, what do you know about,
uh, vulcanized rubber?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.753
Spock's birth control.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.007
You need these books.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.139
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.725
This used to be your room?

14:12.893 --> 14:16.229
Wow. Oh, you must have been in
really good shape as a kid.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.359
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.529
I can't believe I actually thought
she could change.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.448
Look, who cares what your mom thinks?

14:27.616 --> 14:29.742
So you pulled a Monica.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.037
Oh, good. I'm glad that's catching on.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.791
Why does that have to be a bad thing?
Just change what it means.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.544
You know, go down there
and prove your mother wrong.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.381
You finish the job you were hired to do
and we'll call that "pulling a Monica."

14:44.008 --> 14:45.049
What?

14:45.801 --> 14:49.178
Okay, um, if a kid gets straight A's,
his parents would say:

14:49.346 --> 14:50.889
"Yeah, you pulled a Monica." Ha, ha.

14:51.891 --> 14:56.269
Oh, or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,
"Yeah, no, he pulled a Monica."

14:57.938 --> 15:00.648
Or someone hits a home run,
and the announcer says:

15:00.816 --> 15:02.358
"Yeah, that one's out of here."

15:02.526 --> 15:04.527
Because some things don't change.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.573
All right. I'll go down there.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.076
But I'm not gonna serve the lasagna.
I'm gonna serve something that I make.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.870
Wait.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.041
Ooh.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.627
Oh! Wow.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.630
Wow, my breasts are really strong.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.595
Chandler.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.640
Chandler, please. I have to get you
locked up back the way you were.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.600
I'm so going to lose my job.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.853
She's very private about her office.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.897
Now I know why.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.107
Hey, look.
You're in trouble either way, okay?

15:43.275 --> 15:45.777
If she comes and sees me
locked to this instead of the chair...

15:45.945 --> 15:49.489
...she's gonna know you were in here.
So you might as well just let me go.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.370
- I'll clean your bathroom for a month.
- Still wouldn't be clean.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.873
All I want is my freedom.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.960
- Foot rubs for a month.
- Freedom.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.337
I'll take all your photos
and put them into albums.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.005
Freedom. I want my freedom.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.466
Why won't you hear me?
Sophie, help me.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.885
- Help me.
- Sophie, sit.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.847
God, would you just calm down?

16:22.106 --> 16:24.983
I'm going to say this for the last time.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.819
Would you please just...?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.409
Wow, there's a lot I didn't know
about vomit.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.747
In a minute.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.917
So, what do you say, Joey?

16:43.085 --> 16:46.879
You get the whole set
of encyclopedias for $1200.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.841
That works out to just 50 bucks a book.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.884
Twelve hundred dollars?

16:53.679 --> 16:56.264
You think I have $1200?

16:56.432 --> 16:58.182
I'm home in the middle of the day...

16:58.350 --> 17:01.310
...and I got patio furniture
in my living room.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.897
I guess there's a few things
you don't get from book learning.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.192
Well, uh, what can you swing?

17:08.944 --> 17:13.031
How about zero down and zero a month
for a long, long time?

17:14.032 --> 17:16.367
You don't have anything?

17:16.535 --> 17:19.162
You want to see what I got? Okay.

17:19.329 --> 17:22.582
I got a baby Tootsie Roll...

17:22.750 --> 17:25.917
...a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...

17:28.297 --> 17:29.881
...a rock...

17:30.049 --> 17:32.050
...and an army man.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.304
Okay, I get the picture.
Uh, thanks for your time.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.890
And a fifty.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.517
Huh. These must be Chandler's pants.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.228
For 50 bucks you can get one book.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.356
What will it be? A? B? C?

17:47.524 --> 17:49.150
I think I'm gonna stick with the V.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.320
I want to see how this bad boy turns out.
Heh.

17:55.991 --> 17:59.160
I, uh, will buy and wrap
all of your Christmas gifts.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.079
- No.
- Oh.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.707
I, uh... Oh, I'll squeeze you
fresh orange juice every morning.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.417
- With extra pulp?
- Yeah.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.044
No.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.299
I've got it.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.635
You don't have it.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.179
I have so got it.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.432
There's gonna be rumors about this.
There's no way to stop it.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.518
Sophie knows,
Monica and Phoebe know.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.728
- How do Monica and Phoebe know?
- Oh, I called them.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.607
When they ask me what I saw...

18:29.775 --> 18:32.777
...I can be very generous...

18:34.446 --> 18:36.614
...or very stingy.

18:38.867 --> 18:42.870
- Go on.
- I can make you a legend.

18:43.038 --> 18:46.999
I can make you this generation's
Milton Berle.

18:47.876 --> 18:51.379
- And Milton Berle has...
- Oh. Not compared to you.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.802
- Well?
- They're not even touching the lasagna.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.012
- Really?
- Oh, they love your casserole.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.305
Yes.

19:01.765 --> 19:05.393
It's hard to believe, just a little while ago,
this was nothing but ingredients.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.106
Everyone seems to like your dish.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.858
And you?

19:12.025 --> 19:13.943
I thought it was...

19:14.945 --> 19:16.445
...quite tasty.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.741
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it...

19:20.909 --> 19:24.203
...that would make this a success.
Which would make you...

19:24.454 --> 19:25.913
A bitch?

19:27.416 --> 19:29.834
Well, I was going for "wrong,"
but we can use your word.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.921
Yes, well, I was wrong.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.257
And I have to say...

19:37.092 --> 19:39.051
...you really impressed me today.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.096
Wow.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.266
Um, you might even say
that she pulled a Monica.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.271
She doesn't know we switched it.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.984
And the next time you cater for me...

19:55.360 --> 19:58.404
...there will be nothing but ice
in the freezer.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.948
Well, that really means a lot.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.201
Oh, Mom, don't bite your nails.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.043
- Hello.
- Hey.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.545
Hello, Chandler.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.715
I love you.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.967
Hey, what's going on?

20:20.135 --> 20:21.385
Oh.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.599
No, he doesn't.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.728
Two hours, that lasted.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.232
So did you break up with Joanna?

20:34.399 --> 20:35.733
I think so.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.904
Well, it's a good thing you got out when
you did, before she blew up like Vesuvius.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.406
- The volcano?
- Yeah.

20:42.699 --> 20:47.703
And speaking of volcanoes, man,
are they a violent, igneous-rock formation.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.747
What?

20:49.998 --> 20:52.708
Oh, yeah. Lava spewing, hot ash.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.710
Of course, some are dormant.

20:54.878 --> 20:57.922
Why are you talking about volcanoes
all of a sudden?

20:58.090 --> 20:59.548
Oh, we can talk about something else.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.842
What do you want to talk about?
Vivisection?

21:03.470 --> 21:05.388
The vas deferens?

21:05.847 --> 21:07.765
The Vietnam War?

21:08.308 --> 21:11.310
Oh, did anybody see that documentary
on the Korean War?

21:11.478 --> 21:13.437
Oh, yeah.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.314
Oh, God,
Korea's such a beautiful country.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.693
- With such a sad history.
- Yeah.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.361
Could there be more Kims?

21:29.871 --> 21:32.248
- Who's out there?
- It's me. Good morning.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.375
Rachel, could you come in here a moment?

21:34.543 --> 21:37.545
Yeah, sure. Um, they didn't have
poppy-seed bagels...

21:37.713 --> 21:40.089
...so I have sesame ones... Oh, my word.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.383
I...

21:42.884 --> 21:45.094
I seem to have had
a slight office mishap.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.848
Could you get the key
off the back of the door?

21:49.016 --> 21:51.642
Yeah, sure. I...

21:56.189 --> 21:57.732
I'm so sorry.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.693
Tell your friend Chandler
that we're definitely broken up this time.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.153
Okay.
