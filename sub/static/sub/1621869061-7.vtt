He likes you.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.765
It's not that simple.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.850
It's…

12:50.144 --> 12:52.229
You're not actually going there, are you?

12:52.730 --> 12:53.731
I knew it.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.317
Do these people even exist?

12:56.984 --> 12:57.902
I think so.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.322
I was thinking about looking for them.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.325
Has anything you've said been true?

13:05.409 --> 13:06.869
I hate adults.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.664
-[exhales]
-Look, I didn't know where else to go.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.708
And you guys needed
to get to the train, so--

13:15.002 --> 13:16.295
So what now?

13:16.378 --> 13:18.589
I don't know. I thought you had a plan.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.674
[Jepperd] I'll talk to him.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.052
I'll let him down gently.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.845
You don't do gentle.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.306
Hey, guys!

13:28.474 --> 13:29.433
Look!

13:29.517 --> 13:31.519
[hopeful music playing]

13:33.395 --> 13:35.523
[Bear]
There's smoke coming out of the chimney.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.525
There's no way.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.318
-Huh?
-Right?

13:47.117 --> 13:48.369
[birds chirping]

13:48.452 --> 13:50.371
[Pubba] Ah, Orion's out tonight.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.248
[Birdie] The Hunter.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.874
[Pubba] Uh, the Mriga.

13:53.958 --> 13:54.917
Says who?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.086
Two and half years of Eastern studies.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.045
A half?

13:58.128 --> 14:00.297
Yeah, I'm not great at finishing things.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.384
It means the deer.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.386
[Birdie] Hmm.

14:10.933 --> 14:11.851
What?

14:12.518 --> 14:13.352
Nothing.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.396
This is me.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.570
Do you want some hot chocolate?

14:22.653 --> 14:24.446
[chuckles] Hot chocolate?

14:25.781 --> 14:26.657
Sure.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.411
I have a real bad sweet tooth.
Don't tell anyone.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.288
["Ripple" by Grateful Dead playing]

14:32.371 --> 14:35.291
[kettle whistling]

14:40.379 --> 14:41.297
Marshmallows?

14:42.923 --> 14:43.757
What's this?

14:43.841 --> 14:45.342
Mm-hmm.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.678
That's a lifetime ago.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.514
-[Pubba] Oh, you look great.
-Mm-mm.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.393
[Pubba] Oh, Mark Twain fan?

14:55.060 --> 14:57.271
[Birdie] Uh, sentimental value.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.357
My dad read it to me so many times
I could recite it by heart.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.067
It's my husband's favorite.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.486
Oh, you're married?

15:04.987 --> 15:05.863
Was.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.781
Divorced?

15:07.865 --> 15:09.033
Widowed.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.577
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

15:11.660 --> 15:12.786
No, it's fine.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.707
I mean, it's not fine that he's dead,
but it was a while ago.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.500
-I was still teaching.
-Okay.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.044
Sorry. [titters]

15:21.587 --> 15:23.130
Can I ask how it happened?

15:23.213 --> 15:27.301
HPS.
It only affects one percent of people.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.263
That's when I abandoned
the classroom for the lab.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.183
Thought if I couldn't save him,
then I'd save someone else.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.100
Here.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.561
You wanna sit down?

15:37.645 --> 15:38.479
Yeah.

15:40.564 --> 15:41.607
[Pubba sniffs]

15:43.984 --> 15:46.320
-So what were you drawing?
-Hmm?

15:46.403 --> 15:49.406
At the bar, you were drawing--
You were very into your drawing.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.658
Oh.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.243
I don't know. Some little characters.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.245
I get lost in it sometimes.

15:55.913 --> 15:59.041
Creating little worlds
out of nothing, you know?

15:59.708 --> 16:02.461
In another life, I'd probably
be drawing children's books.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.421
What about in this life?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.008
Not sure if it's meant to be. Um…

16:08.550 --> 16:10.803
Besides,
I'm not really great at the story part.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.765
I mean, everyone's got
a good story in them.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.017
Maybe you just haven't found yours yet.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.727
One day.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.357
My job at the lab
was not really part of my long-term plan,

16:23.440 --> 16:25.985
you know, but it pays the bills,

16:26.068 --> 16:29.530
and turns out
I'm naturally gifted at fixing things.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.410
Oh, my God,
you make great hot chocolate.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.996
It's a science, not an art form.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.497
Yeah.

16:46.964 --> 16:47.798
You have…

16:48.549 --> 16:49.675
Sorry. [chuckles]

16:49.758 --> 16:50.592
Milk.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.223
You can come closer here
if you want. [titters]

16:56.306 --> 16:57.141
What?

16:57.224 --> 16:58.559
You can come closer.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.019
All right.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.279
[cell phone ringing]

17:11.613 --> 17:14.199
[sighs] I… Excuse me. Sorry.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.117
[Pubba] Yeah.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.202
[ringing continues]

17:21.874 --> 17:24.668
-Uh, I have to take this.
-Oh, yeah, of course.

17:24.752 --> 17:25.836
I'm so sorry. Um…

17:25.919 --> 17:28.088
Hey. Everything okay?

17:29.214 --> 17:30.049
What?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.216
Where?

17:32.301 --> 17:35.304
-Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. I'm coming.
-[cell phone beeping]

17:35.387 --> 17:36.555
[exhales]

17:37.514 --> 17:38.515
Is everything cool?

17:38.599 --> 17:43.062
No. The military is taking over the lab
and they are seizing everything.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.354
-When?
-Uh, right now.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.940
So I'm guessing by your expression,
that's bad?

17:47.024 --> 17:48.525
Yes, it's very bad.

17:48.609 --> 17:53.280
Judy hid my project in a storage closet,
but I need to get to the lab right now.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.574
Okay. Birdie,
it's almost two in the morning.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.452
Oh, my God. They took my keys.
I can't get inside.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.079
-[ominous music playing]
-[Birdie sighs]

18:00.162 --> 18:03.665
This is bad. This is very bad. Oh, my God.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.292
What am I gonna do?

18:05.375 --> 18:07.377
[keys jingling]

18:08.962 --> 18:09.963
Would these help?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.593
-You don't have to do that.
-Are you kidding?

18:14.676 --> 18:18.347
Tonight's been the most exciting thing
that's possibly ever happened to me.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.933
Come on, I'll drive.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.602
Okay.

This is it!

18:28.273 --> 18:29.233

18:30.275 --> 18:31.151
How many, kid?

18:31.819 --> 18:32.653
Just one.

-[Bear] Wait, Gus.

18:36.949 --> 18:37.783
[Jepperd] Gus.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.660
I told you guys she'd be here.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.120
-[Bear] Hold on.
-[Jepperd] Gus.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.162
[Gus] Hello?

18:43.789 --> 18:44.623
Hello?

18:44.706 --> 18:48.168
Gus, listen, you can't
just run up on people and--

18:48.252 --> 18:49.128
-[Gus] Hello?
-Gus.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.088
[woman] Go away!

18:51.922 --> 18:52.756
[Gus] Mom?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.008
It's me. Open up.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.468
[door creaking]

18:56.552 --> 18:57.928
[woman] Get off my porch!

18:58.011 --> 18:59.638
-Hey, lady.
-[breathing heavily]

18:59.721 --> 19:02.391
Lady, we're not here to hurt you.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.312
Your name's not Birdie, is it?

19:09.857 --> 19:10.983
Say that again?

19:11.942 --> 19:13.443
Birdie. She's my mom.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.947
[door unlocks]

19:22.703 --> 19:23.537
Gus?

19:26.081 --> 19:26.957
You…

19:33.505 --> 19:35.215
You're still alive.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.692
[keys jingling]

19:53.775 --> 19:57.654
[Pubba] I still don't understand why the
military wants to shut this place down.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.698
Remember when I said
hell would break loose?

20:00.324 --> 20:03.118
Wait a minute. What exactly did you make?

20:03.619 --> 20:04.494
You'll see.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.546
[woman] Hope you like blueberry wine.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.965
So how long have you lived here, Miss…

20:17.049 --> 20:19.009
[woman] Ever since things went to shit.

20:20.677 --> 20:21.511
Call me Judy.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.722
How do you know Birdie?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.391
We used to work together.

20:27.434 --> 20:28.560
Oh, and then one day…

20:30.145 --> 20:31.813
she saved my life.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.398
Whoa.

20:34.858 --> 20:38.403
I came back to check on her here
when the Sick started.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.822
Found people ransacking the place.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.407
I tried to stop them, but…

20:42.908 --> 20:43.742
[clears throat]

20:44.701 --> 20:46.119
They left me for dead.

20:46.703 --> 20:47.621
Last Men?

20:47.704 --> 20:49.331
[Judy] It was before their time.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.250
It was the military.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.419
Your mother found me.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.505
Took care of me. Nursed me back.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.341
She let me stay here with her.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.510
So, she's a doctor?

21:01.593 --> 21:02.719
Well, not exactly.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.852
She doesn't live here anymore, does she?

21:16.650 --> 21:17.609
I'm afraid not.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.448
So, where did Birdie go?

21:23.532 --> 21:24.908
[Judy] I honestly don't know.

21:26.034 --> 21:29.413
One night she packed a bag
and she went out to look for you.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.374
I begged her not to go.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.168
But she wouldn't listen.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.671
That was ten years ago.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.550
And I've been alone here ever since.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.221
[church bells chiming]

21:54.313 --> 21:55.897
[suspenseful music playing]

21:55.981 --> 21:57.274
Fort Smith.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.192
Sorry?

21:59.276 --> 22:00.610
The flower holder.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.654
It says "Fort Smith Labs."

22:08.452 --> 22:10.495
-It's the same as Pubba's!
-What's a Pubba?

22:10.579 --> 22:11.830
It's his dad.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.498
What does Fort Smith Labs mean?

22:13.582 --> 22:14.875
[Judy] That's where we worked.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.543
She was a scientist.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.546
So, that means Pubba was a scientist too.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.384
Richard Fox.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.011
You knew my Pubba?

22:31.183 --> 22:32.142

22:37.731 --> 22:39.608
-[keypad beeping]
-[lock clicks]

22:49.534 --> 22:50.410
Thanks.

22:52.412 --> 22:53.455
What's it for?

22:53.538 --> 22:54.873
It's for the attic.

22:54.956 --> 22:58.502
Birdie asked me to keep it safe,
in case anyone came looking,

22:58.585 --> 23:00.587
but I think she'd want you to see it.

23:01.755 --> 23:02.589
Let's go!

23:05.008 --> 23:06.343
Oh, man.

23:06.927 --> 23:07.844
[ominous music playing]

23:07.928 --> 23:10.680
Hey, does Fort Smith
sound familiar to you?

23:10.764 --> 23:12.891
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.143
They closed it
when the virus began to spread.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.687
Rumor was
it was where the virus first started.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.231
[Gus] Hey, you guys coming?

23:19.981 --> 23:20.982
Uh, yeah.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.069
[music builds to a climax]

23:24.152 --> 23:25.278
[whispering] This way.

-[people clamoring]
-[machinery whirring]

23:51.555 --> 23:52.973
Oh, no.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.392
[music swells]

24:09.739 --> 24:10.615
[Jepperd] Here.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.415
I'm pretty sure
this is how most horror films start.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.170
[suspenseful music playing]

24:23.253 --> 24:26.423
[whispering] I can honestly say this is
not how I thought this night would go.

24:26.506 --> 24:29.342
You've never had to break into
a laboratory on a date before?

24:29.426 --> 24:31.428
Wait, this is a date?

24:31.511 --> 24:32.512
Keys.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.309
[Pubba] Got it. Got it.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.564
[sniffs]

24:44.649 --> 24:46.151
Mama smells like peaches.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.903
[hopeful music playing]

24:47.986 --> 24:49.070
More like mothballs.

24:55.869 --> 24:59.581
Hey. Did it seem like
Judy knew more than she was telling us?

25:00.207 --> 25:01.291
A hundred percent.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.918
[Jepperd sighs]

25:05.795 --> 25:07.088
[whispers] I think it's time.

25:07.589 --> 25:08.507
Yeah.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.635
It's her!

25:12.260 --> 25:14.971
Jepp, who's that old guy
in the photo with her?

25:15.055 --> 25:16.348
[Jepperd] It's probably her dad.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.850
Wait, so…

25:18.934 --> 25:20.268
He'd be your grandpa.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.853
My grandpubba?

25:21.937 --> 25:23.438
Jepp, I have a grandpubba!

25:23.522 --> 25:24.814
Yeah, that's nice.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.733
Um…

25:30.946 --> 25:31.947
We need to talk.

25:32.864 --> 25:36.368
I heard you talking earlier,
and I know what you're gonna say.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.995
You think this is a waste of time,

25:39.079 --> 25:40.372
but you're wrong.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.165
Look how far we've come.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.460
We're standing
in the middle of my mom's house.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.046
You never thought that we'd get this far.

25:48.713 --> 25:49.631
Admit it.

25:52.133 --> 25:54.135
I know you've given up on a lot of things,

25:54.219 --> 25:57.097
but that doesn't mean
I have to give up too.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.391
None of us should.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.157
Uh, Jepp?

26:18.034 --> 26:19.786
I think you need to see this.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.748
[suspenseful music playing]

26:23.832 --> 26:25.292
[Pubba] What the hell is this thing?

26:25.375 --> 26:27.127
[Birdie] The microbe I told you about?

26:27.210 --> 26:28.795
-[machinery beeping]
-Yeah.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.716
We accidentally made a miracle…

26:34.968 --> 26:36.261
and created this.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.308
[Pubba whispers] What…

26:43.935 --> 26:45.353
My God.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.689
Hey, buddy.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.024
[baby cooing]

26:54.696 --> 26:55.697
[chuckles]

26:55.780 --> 26:56.698
He likes you.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.536
What is he?

27:06.791 --> 27:08.585
[Gus] G-U-S. It spells out my name.

27:08.668 --> 27:11.588
[ominous music playing]

27:11.671 --> 27:15.008
"Genetic Unit Series 1"?

27:15.884 --> 27:16.801
What does that mean?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.596
It's nothing. It's probably nothing.

27:20.388 --> 27:22.223
Well, what is it?

27:23.058 --> 27:24.476
What's a genetic unit?

27:25.393 --> 27:28.438
[Bear] It looks like a project
your mom was working on.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.484
What do you mean, "project"?

27:38.448 --> 27:39.282
What is it?

27:46.623 --> 27:48.333
That's me, isn't it?

27:49.834 --> 27:51.086
I think so, kid.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.838
[Gus] Who are all the people with Birdie?

27:53.922 --> 27:55.048
Where's Pubba?

27:59.302 --> 28:02.013
-[heart monitor beeping]
-[heart pounding]

28:02.097 --> 28:05.058
Why are there tubes sticking out of me?
Was I sick?

28:05.141 --> 28:07.143
-[heart rate increases]
-Hi.

28:07.727 --> 28:08.937
Morning, Gus.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.440
Gus, meet Richard.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.900
Hey, Gus.

28:13.983 --> 28:15.318
[Gus cooing]

28:15.402 --> 28:16.778
[Pubba] What's up, buddy?

-[exhales]
-[cooing continues]

28:21.741 --> 28:23.159
[Gus cries]

28:23.243 --> 28:26.579
-[soldier] Okay! Open it up!
-We have to get him out of here.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.915
-They're outside the door.
-You don't understand.

28:28.998 --> 28:32.627
If they get him on that truck,
they'll dissect him and experiment on him.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.586
It's okay, buddy.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.463
Look, I'll distract them. Okay?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.340
[shushing] What are you talking about?

28:37.424 --> 28:38.717
I have a plan.

28:40.844 --> 28:41.678
It's okay.

[vacuum cleaner whirring]

29:02.741 --> 29:03.742
[soldier] Hey, you!

29:05.618 --> 29:07.954
Yeah, you. What the hell are you doing?

29:08.037 --> 29:09.080
What's it look like?

29:09.164 --> 29:11.875
I'm… I'm vacuuming.
These carpets are a lint magnet.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.628
This is a classified area.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.172
You need to leave now.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.049
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know
what would be really great

29:20.133 --> 29:22.552
is if you would stop, like,
walking where I'm cleaning.

29:22.635 --> 29:24.971
Otherwise it's going
to take me twice as long.

29:25.054 --> 29:28.558
All non-essential personnel
must leave immediately.

29:28.641 --> 29:31.561
Okay, okay. You've just got
to take it up with my supervisor.

29:32.145 --> 29:32.979
Who is this guy?

29:33.646 --> 29:35.315
Richard. I'm… I'm Richard Fox.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.358
[Gus crying]

29:37.442 --> 29:38.359
Go, now.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.074
[Gus] Where's Pubba?

29:46.618 --> 29:49.078
-Where's Pubba?
-Gus? I want you to listen to me, okay?

29:49.162 --> 29:50.371
No, I need to find Pubba.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.540
[Jepperd] Gus. Listen to Bear.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.335
I never told you this, but I was adopted.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.961
Do you know what that means?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.964
It means that
your parents aren't your parents.

30:00.048 --> 30:03.760
No. No, no, no. It means they were
as much my parents as my biological--

30:03.843 --> 30:05.637
Stop using big words!

30:05.720 --> 30:07.764
It just means that
her parents didn't make her

30:07.847 --> 30:10.099
the same way
other kids' parents made them.

30:10.767 --> 30:11.935
What are you saying?

30:15.313 --> 30:17.816
They're still my parents, right?

30:21.611 --> 30:22.695
Right?

30:22.779 --> 30:25.114
-It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
-[Gus crying]

30:25.198 --> 30:28.201
Everything's gonna be okay, okay? Okay?

30:28.284 --> 30:30.453
Everything's gonna be okay.

30:30.537 --> 30:33.289
We're gonna keep you safe,
all right? All right?

30:33.915 --> 30:35.542
Me and that nice man.

30:38.711 --> 30:40.171
You'll always be…

30:41.923 --> 30:42.799
safe.

30:54.352 --> 30:55.895
Come on! This is the way.

30:56.437 --> 30:57.605
[somber music playing]

30:57.689 --> 30:58.690
I have to go back.

31:00.108 --> 31:00.984
Are you crazy?

31:01.067 --> 31:02.569
No, you need to take Gus.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.904
-You need to take Gus right now, okay?
-What?

31:04.988 --> 31:07.991
It's okay. I need to go back.
I need to get all of my research,

31:08.074 --> 31:09.701
and I need to burn the place down.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.703
That research and what we've been doing,

31:11.786 --> 31:14.581
in the wrong hands
will kill millions of people.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.124
[Gus crying]

31:16.207 --> 31:19.043
-You need to take Gus now.
-Listen, I just met you, all right?

31:19.127 --> 31:22.171
And you seem nice, but I can't do this.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.381
I'm nobody.

31:23.464 --> 31:27.719
Exactly, you're nobody, they won't come
looking for you, so you can keep Gus safe.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.846
-Oh, God.
-Did you hear? Keep him safe.

31:29.929 --> 31:33.141

It's okay. You're going to be safe. Okay.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.193
[Gus cooing]

31:45.278 --> 31:46.905
I don't know anything about babies.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.908
I don't know anything
about saving the world.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.910
-[gates rattle]
-[alarm blaring]

31:57.123 --> 31:58.041
I'll find you.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.670
[Gus crying]

32:10.345 --> 32:11.179
[Gus] Tell me!

32:11.262 --> 32:15.058
Don't ask questions
you don't want answers to.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.394
Tell me.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.527
It seems like these scientists

32:27.737 --> 32:30.073
may have created you.

32:34.535 --> 32:37.705
[Bear]
Hey. But this doesn't change anything.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.334
Yes, it does.

32:42.418 --> 32:43.878
It changes everything.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.215
That's why he never talked about her.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.717
Well, maybe he was trying to protect you.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.886
If scientists created me,

32:53.262 --> 32:55.264
I don't have a mom, do I?

32:56.766 --> 32:57.850
Or a dad.

32:57.934 --> 33:00.311
We don't know the whole story yet.

33:00.395 --> 33:04.065
But he did raise you on his own
and kept you safe.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.942
Most people wouldn't have done that.
Trust me.

33:06.025 --> 33:08.486
He lied to me! About everything!

33:09.153 --> 33:10.655
Gus, come on. Let's get some air.

33:10.738 --> 33:13.032
No! I'm not listening to you anymore.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.742
-You're not my dad, either.
