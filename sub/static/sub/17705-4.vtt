09:48.459 --> 09:50.083
- Game, is it?

09:50.125 --> 09:52.000
- Caribou.

09:52.042 --> 09:54.834
It's rather tough,

09:52.042 --> 09:54.834

10:05.083 --> 10:07.083

10:07.125 --> 10:09.542

10:19.042 --> 10:21.667

He has asked for a full report.

19:51.417 --> 19:54.626
Declan Harp.

He's in terrible danger.
