01:38.974 --> 01:41.768
Ellsworth:
He's down that hole for a fact.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.688
Pitiful as you pursued it,

01:45.856 --> 01:47.940
you better hope
he ain't got space enough

01:48.108 --> 01:52.069
to roll around holding his sides,
bust a gut laughing.

01:54.782 --> 01:58.993
Tell all the other woodchucks
at the club this afternoon.

01:59.995 --> 02:03.915
He might not even call it an escape.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.543
Might just call it
his "morning's entertainment."

02:07.711 --> 02:11.464
Dan:
Hey! Hey, Ellsworth!

02:11.632 --> 02:13.466
Hey, Dan Dority!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.259
(whimpers)

02:15.427 --> 02:17.845
Where's the great prospector?

02:18.013 --> 02:20.515
I guess Brom slept in this morning.

02:20.682 --> 02:24.143
Suppose his enthusiasm's
on the wane?

02:24.311 --> 02:26.103
That's always possible.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.273
He shows up,
you tell him I quit waitin'.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.068
- Sure will.
- See ya at The Gem.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.237
Always possible.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.615
(yells)
Go on!

02:41.495 --> 02:44.664
Reverend: "The earth is the Lord's,
and the fullness thereof;

02:44.832 --> 02:46.999
the world, and they that dwell therein.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.335
For He hath founded it upon the seas,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.379
and established it upon the floods.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.340
Who shall ascend
into the hill of the Lord?"

02:54.508 --> 02:57.134
- (sneezing)
- "Or who shall stand in His holy place?

02:57.302 --> 03:02.265
He that hath clean hands,
and a pure heart;

03:02.432 --> 03:04.475
who hath not lifted up his soul

03:04.643 --> 03:07.395
- unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully."
- (sneezes)

03:07.563 --> 03:10.314
"He shall receive
the blessing from the Lord,

03:10.482 --> 03:13.943
and justice from the God
of his salvation.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.362
Lift up your heads, O ye gates;

03:16.530 --> 03:18.656
and be ye lifted up,
ye everlasting doors;

03:18.824 --> 03:21.617
and the King of glory shall come in.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.870
Who is the King of glory?

03:24.037 --> 03:26.873
The Lord of Hosts,
He is the King of Glory.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.875
Selah."

03:29.042 --> 03:31.502
(man yells) Let me see them titties!
What's your name?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.880
What's your name?

03:36.174 --> 03:38.384
(men hooting)

04:02.200 --> 04:04.035
Pull that sign a little to the right.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.412
No no no. That way, that way.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.085
(whispers)

04:19.593 --> 04:23.220
"Everyone proud in heart
is an abomination to the Lord.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.974
Though hand join in hand,
he shall not be unpunished."

04:27.142 --> 04:28.351
(sneezing)

04:28.518 --> 04:30.436
"By mercy and truth is inequity purged.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.023
And by the fear of the Lord,
do men depart from evil.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.442
A man's ways please the Lord

04:36.610 --> 04:40.696
when he maketh even his enemies
to be at peace with him."

04:44.284 --> 04:46.118
Amen.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.454
Amen.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.667
Thank you.
Thanks for your help.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.002
May we edify
my readers, Mr. Bullock?

04:55.170 --> 04:57.088
I don't know what "edify" means.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.090
Can we talk about
last night's gunfight?

04:59.257 --> 05:00.508
No.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.762
We can't talk about last night's
gunfight either.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.228
- What the fuck?!
- EB: All's I can speculate, Al,

05:12.396 --> 05:14.397
is whoever these
Bella Union people are,

05:14.564 --> 05:17.066
they bought
Artie Simpson's place on the quiet.

05:17.234 --> 05:21.445
- Pre-arranged turnin' it into a joint.
- This no-good fucking Judas!

05:22.990 --> 05:26.117
- Hey, fucknut!
- Just take it easy, Al.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.702
How long you been hatching this?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.788
I made a practical
goddamn business decision.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.207
No chance for me to match
their fucking offer?

05:33.375 --> 05:36.252
You couldn't have. You'd have
killed me before you'd matched.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.254
But it's between you and them now.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.339
Drive careful, cocksucker!

05:40.507 --> 05:43.009
Don't think I haven't
taken precaution.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.469
Don't think I don't know your mind!

05:51.643 --> 05:53.436
I hate to press you
on that lot, Mr. Swearengen.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.021
I ain't ready to settle yet.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.024
- We're anxious to build.
- If you want an answer now, it's no.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.653
Two.

06:08.076 --> 06:11.871
Same for me, only better.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.540
And three to the dealer.
The dealer draws...

06:14.708 --> 06:18.252
trench mouth.
Opener bets.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.671
Well damn, Wild Bill.

06:20.839 --> 06:24.091
Even a stopped clock's
gotta be right sometime.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.886
Common law just says you gonna
win one sooner or later.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.972
But I'm gonna keep
pushin' my luck.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.892
What do you got there? $8.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.312
Are you ready to stand any more
credit to Wild Bill, Tom?

06:36.480 --> 06:38.522
I didn't hear him ask for any.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.358
You want me to just bet eight, Bill?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.073
Cover my call.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.410
Aw, Bill, I can't
let you put your gun up.

06:51.578 --> 06:55.998
That Colt's worth more than
my raise by a good 40 bucks.

06:56.166 --> 06:59.085
- Are you takin' the bet?
- I tell you what,

06:59.252 --> 07:03.714
I'll add 40 bucks to my raise
to make the bet fair.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.550
And then 50 more,

07:06.718 --> 07:08.677
if you'll put up a set.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.773
(laughs)

07:22.275 --> 07:24.443
Pot's right.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.660
Would a nine-high straight
do the trick?

07:36.164 --> 07:38.290
Pot to the club flush.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.545
Well, that's one in a row
for you, Wild Bill.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.464
Who's hungry?

07:45.632 --> 07:47.591
What in the hell damn time
is it anyway?

07:47.759 --> 07:50.386
Sure you wanna
quit playing, Jack?

07:51.888 --> 07:54.723
The game's always between you
and getting called a cunt.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.226
Meeting's adjourned, fellas.
Take it outside.

07:57.394 --> 08:01.272
That dropped eye of yours looks like
the hood on a cunt to me, Jack.

08:01.439 --> 08:05.734
When you talk, your mouth
looks like a cunt moving.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.654
I ain't gonna get
in no gunfight with you, Hickok.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.782
But you will run
your cunt mouth at me...

08:13.410 --> 08:16.162
and I will take it to play poker.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.292
Tom:
I'll tote up accounts, Mr. Hickok.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.837
We'll do whatever business
we need to next you're in.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.549
Anyone wants to
can find me at the Grand Central.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.102
- Jane: She's warm, isn't she?
- Charlie: She ain't talk yet, neither.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.272
That's beside the point.
You shut up!

08:43.440 --> 08:45.608
She will get a fever,
bein' wolf bit.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.194
The reason we risked
bringin' her into camp.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.362
You don't need to fear
the saloonkeeper.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.032
- He's not a danger to her no more.
- He's not?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.618
Saloonkeeper worried
that the little one

08:55.785 --> 08:57.953
said road agents killed her people--

08:58.121 --> 09:00.331
who the road agents
might say they worked for.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.625
Meaning him?

09:02.792 --> 09:06.045
He took a different
approach to the problem.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.881
She would do better indoors.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.384
I told Jane she could take
my room with the little one

09:12.552 --> 09:14.136
and I'd move back in with Bill.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.431
I will not stay in no fuckin' hotel!
They won't give me a room!

09:17.599 --> 09:20.476
You two keep your voices down.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.323
What'd I say about noise?

09:34.491 --> 09:37.243
He snores the whole fuckin' night!

09:38.495 --> 09:41.330
Snoring's past a person's control.

09:42.415 --> 09:46.460
I was a field nurse during the war,
at Shiloh and Second Manassas.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.921
That was a good deal of violence.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.423
Is that when you got your calling?

09:51.591 --> 09:54.843
Yes, it was, sir.
Out of that crucible--

09:55.011 --> 09:58.180
out of all that horror,
to come to God's grace.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.183
A man's heart deviseth his way,

10:01.351 --> 10:05.437
but the Lord directeth his steps.

10:05.605 --> 10:09.942
He directeth all our steps,
Mr. Bullock. All of us.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.027
If you're preaching at me, Reverend,

10:12.195 --> 10:14.738
you need to put some more
light on the text.

10:14.906 --> 10:18.158
If I am preaching at you, sir,
I do you a disservice.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.494
Good morning, Mr. Star.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.204
Good morning, Reverend.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.581
Seth: Did we get the lot?
Can we start building?

10:24.749 --> 10:27.376
- The reverend's come to help.
- We're still hangin' fire.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.421
- What's the damn holdup?
- New gambling outfit come into town.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.590
- Time wasn't right to push him.
- I got all the lumber cut.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.885
- And I warned you that was premature.
- You said 98%

10:37.053 --> 10:39.680
after your last conversation
with that son of a bitch.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.849
98 is not 100.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.226
God damn it!

10:45.603 --> 10:48.564
- Good day, sirs.
- Sol: Good day, Reverend.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.152
Jane:
I said they'd find a way to stop me.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.113
If it's raising room rates,
you have to go ahead and raise 'em.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.491
Rates aren't the only factor.
There's a waiting list for occupancy.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.535
You undertaker-looking
son of a bitch,

11:01.703 --> 11:04.121
this little girl's doctor
ordered her to live indoors,

11:04.289 --> 11:06.373
and I'm assigned
to change her dressings!

11:06.541 --> 11:09.335
A sad story...
that's none of my affair, "madam,"

11:09.502 --> 11:11.253
if I guess your sex correct.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.297
What's the problem, innkeeper?

11:13.465 --> 11:15.841
Mr. Hickok.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.510
Little one took fever
in that wagon last night, Bill.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.013
And I thought Jane and her
could stay in my room

11:21.181 --> 11:22.765
and I'd move back in with you.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.309
EB: I'm not in opposition, sir.
Just the opposite.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.686
Who wouldn't want
to accommodate a sick girl?

11:27.854 --> 11:29.938
But the Simpson Hotel's
closed its doors.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.774
If Mr. Utter's vacating,

11:31.941 --> 11:35.277
shouldn't these people that have been
trying me all morning get first call?

11:35.445 --> 11:37.196
Isn’t that simple fairness?

11:37.364 --> 11:40.449
He don't give fuck all for fairness!
He just don't want me in here.

11:40.617 --> 11:44.161
How 'bout if he stays in his room
and the lady moves in with me?

11:44.329 --> 11:46.288
That way no one's vacating nothing.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.957
That would outflank
the checkout issue.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.959
But it might raise
questions of decorum.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.713
- With who?
- No one of consequence, I suppose.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.507
Let her in.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.842
I'm going to get some breakfast.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.807
There will be a rate adjustment!

12:07.727 --> 12:10.145
Good morning.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.315
I've heard the stories, madam,
I tell you that at flagfall

12:13.483 --> 12:15.776
you are here on sufferance.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.112
Kiss my ass!

12:19.364 --> 12:21.365
Cocksuckers.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.409
Where were they
when Dan and me were

12:23.576 --> 12:26.412
chopping trees in this gulch?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.996
Hands all blistered,

12:28.164 --> 12:31.458
bucktooth fucking beavers
rolling around in the creek,

12:31.626 --> 12:35.712
slapping their tails in the water
like we was hired entertainment.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.173
I'd have paid a nickel
to see you chopping wood.

12:38.341 --> 12:41.009
Yeah. Don't think I wasn't
blow for blow with Dan.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.137
I can play that shit when I have to.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.351
But I've been to Chicago too.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.064
How do I look?

12:54.232 --> 12:56.900
Like Christ crucified.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.914
Al:
Guess this ain't a hotel no more.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.168
Come see us tonight when we open,

13:14.335 --> 13:16.462
we'll find you a place to lay down.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.672
And someone to keep
your feet warm.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.383
I'm Al Swearengen.
I own the joint across the street.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.510
- Man: The Gem?
- That's it.

13:23.678 --> 13:24.761
Cy Tolliver, Al.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.556
Ed Sawyer, Joanie Stubbs.

13:27.724 --> 13:31.727
You people must've
trained with the heathens.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.688
Yeah, you know, you come up
on us unbeknownst.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.565
How long you been in camp, Al?

13:36.733 --> 13:39.359
This year, Cy, since March.
I was here last year too,

13:39.527 --> 13:42.738
- but the fucking cavalry drove us out.
- Put all the whites out, didn't they?

13:42.906 --> 13:46.116
Deep fucking thinkers in Washington
put forward that policy.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.244
This year though, so many
soldiers deserting to prospect,

13:49.412 --> 13:51.497
gave up the ghost, let us all back in.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.041
And of course,
Custer sorted out the Sioux for us,

13:54.209 --> 13:56.418
so now we're all as safe
as at our mothers' tits.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.629
Did a job for our side,
didn't he, Al?

13:58.796 --> 14:01.256
Al: How about that long-haired
fucking blowhard, huh?

14:01.424 --> 14:03.467
I'll tell you this, son,
you can mark my words,

14:03.635 --> 14:05.385
Crazy Horse went into Little Bighorn,

14:05.553 --> 14:07.763
bought his people one good,
long-term ass fucking.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.432
You do not want to be
a dirt-worshipping heathen

14:10.600 --> 14:12.267
from this fucking point forward.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.521
- Pardon my French.
- Oh, I speak French.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.609
Well, here we are,
settling the world's problems.

14:20.777 --> 14:24.613
And I've been wondering, Cy,
um, perhaps we should

14:24.781 --> 14:28.367
talk about our areas of overlap
so we're not at each other's throats.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.453
- Give me a for instance, Al.
- Uh, women.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.539
Would we want to agree on rates?

14:33.706 --> 14:37.501
Well, far as pussy, Al, we'll want
to let the market sort itself out.

14:37.669 --> 14:41.046
Sounds to me like I'm up
against specialty acts.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.132
How about table games,
any overlap there?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.301
We'll be featuring craps, Al.

14:46.469 --> 14:49.471
I played that in Chicago.
I don't offer it myself,

14:49.639 --> 14:53.058
gets these hoople-heads
confused, hmm?

14:54.185 --> 14:56.770
That's one area of overlap avoided.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.897
- What about faro?
- We'll have it.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.691
Al: That decision hard and fast?

15:00.858 --> 15:03.819
Cy: I don't see overlap being a problem,
Al, even where we duplicate.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.071
We're offering
different atmospheres.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.491
You're a pioneering type,
a trailblazer type.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.743
You're gonna draw
a trailblazing element.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.954
Meaning I get the ones
that don't wash?

15:14.122 --> 15:17.624
Must cut through the stink when they
walk in with those sacks full of gold.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.711
Oh, the money spends, definitely.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.547
Anyways, thanks for
the neighborly visit.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.133
Yeah, good to meet you.
Very good luck to you.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.093
You're opening at 8:00, huh?

15:28.261 --> 15:30.137
That's what we're aiming at.

15:30.305 --> 15:33.265
8:00.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.726
Good for you.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.437
Wouldn't set a fire right away.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.356
Come to case us though.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.400
He would set a fire.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.030
The way you tell it, mister,

15:48.197 --> 15:51.450
the man didn't sell you that claim
holding a gun to your head.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.368
Frankly, Mr. Hickok,

15:53.536 --> 15:55.746
being a novice in these matters,
I was duped.

15:55.913 --> 15:59.124
And now the seller's disappeared.
You checked into his room.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.001
It sound like you're up shit's creek.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.170
The seller had accomplices, gentlemen.

16:03.338 --> 16:06.298
Men of-- what passes
for position in this place.

16:06.466 --> 16:10.218
I would pay a handsome bounty if they
were brought to make restitutions.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.387
Sorry you lost your money, mister,

16:12.555 --> 16:15.474
but I ain't for hire to rob it back.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.476
I make no terms as to method.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.479
You don't figure a good talking-to
would do the trick?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.651
I'm not leaving camp

16:25.818 --> 16:27.444
without my money.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.988
Mister, that fella you said
had my room before me?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.658
A man named Tim Driscoll,
yes, pure charlatan.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.161
Fresh stain on the floor
when I moved in.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.873
He may have checked out
short a useful amount of blood.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.833
It wouldn't surprise me in the least.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.753
That would make these accomplices
you're talking about

16:44.921 --> 16:46.880
dangerous people to deal with.

16:47.048 --> 16:50.342
Yes, I quite take your point--
no honor among thieves.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.012
Well...

16:54.180 --> 16:56.390
thanks for your time.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.434
I'll pursue my remedies
in some other fashion.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.690
I don't think he took your point...

17:04.857 --> 17:06.316
quite.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.652
I think he quite missed it.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.281
I believe I'll pass out, Charlie.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.034
I guess you were
playing poker all night, huh?

17:16.202 --> 17:17.911
Yes, sir.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.373
When we was coming into camp
I saw that Montana fella

17:21.540 --> 17:23.375
you seem to like.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.377
Bullock.
Had my back again last night.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.964
Well, he was seeing
to the result this morning.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.049
Man has an active conscience.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.052
What would you think of us
and him and his friend

17:34.220 --> 17:37.013
- having dinner tonight?
- Why?

17:37.181 --> 17:39.391
People gotta eat, don't they, Bill?

17:39.559 --> 17:42.227
And maybe you'd enjoy
sitting with someone

17:42.395 --> 17:45.021
who wasn't looking
to beat you at cards.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.483
Or blow your fucking head off.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.527
True enough.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.864
Mark me down for a yes.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.291
- I want to know who did their legwork.
- EB: You hit the nail square, Al.

18:04.459 --> 18:07.085
Whoever went between them
Bella Union people

18:07.253 --> 18:09.880
and Artie Simpson would be
a prime source of information.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.882
Do not repeat back to me

18:12.049 --> 18:15.510
what I just said
in different fucking words!

18:16.679 --> 18:19.306
And I wanna know who cut the cheese.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.187
I'll tell you this for openers--

18:25.354 --> 18:27.522
we are gonna set off
an area on the balcony.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.566
And God help whoever doesn't use it,

18:29.734 --> 18:32.778
because the next stink
I have to smell in this office,

18:32.945 --> 18:35.572
and whoever doesn't admit to it
is going out the window

18:35.740 --> 18:37.949
into the muck
onto their fucking heads

18:38.117 --> 18:41.495
and we'll see how they like
farting from that position, okay?

18:41.662 --> 18:44.414
"I hate to press you
on the lot, Mr. Swearengen."

18:44.582 --> 18:46.166
Wouldn't that be a setup?

18:46.334 --> 18:48.502
If they were all
of the same fucking party?

18:48.669 --> 18:50.712
You think them
hardware guys and Hickok

18:50.880 --> 18:53.632
might be the advance party
for them saloon operators?

18:53.800 --> 18:56.384
You did the same fucking thing
I told you not to.

18:56.552 --> 19:00.347
Get them too, say I'm ready
to conclude on their offer.

19:00.515 --> 19:04.226
Stop at Wu's on the way. Tell him he
feeds his pigs Persimmon Phil tonight,

19:04.393 --> 19:09.481
- or I serve them raw loin of Oriental.
- I thought you forgot all about that.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.609
I thought it just sorta
slipped through the cracks.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.739
The faro dude at the new joint--

19:17.907 --> 19:20.992
dope-fiend.
Tall guy, skankly red beard.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.495
You want me to get next
to him, Mr. Swearengen?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.956
Let me take a few dollars,
I'll go play at his table.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.457
Stop hustling.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.877
I'll give you dope when you
bring that cocksucker here.

19:31.045 --> 19:34.172
He's as good as standing in front
of you, Mr. Swearengen.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.175
No.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.970
Stick around.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.603
Help me measure
where their loyalties lie.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.772
These hardware guys?

19:53.818 --> 19:56.236
The burden falls on me, Alma.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.572
That much is now clear.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.866
Do you think there's
any possibility

20:01.033 --> 20:03.451
that Mr. Hickok might reconsider?

20:03.619 --> 20:05.370
None.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.039
Nor was I sure that, if he'd agreed,

20:08.207 --> 20:11.334
the man before me at that breakfast
table was equal to the task.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.304
Promise me one thing then, Brom.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.181
Don't ask me to amend my purpose.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.393
That before seeing
Mr. Swearengen,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.562
you take your walk.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.485
To clear my head and reflect?

20:37.653 --> 20:40.071
If only to perfect your arguments.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.240
I see.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.912
I accept the suggestion

20:47.079 --> 20:49.664
and a feeling for its author.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.500
Thank you.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.422
If I'm stooped when
next you see me, Alma,

20:57.590 --> 21:01.009
it won't be worry weighing me down
but bags of our recovered gold.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.680
Take your walk, dear.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.331
It's Hickok, Alma.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.667
- Unconscious.
- I see.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.836
I take this as proof
my reservations were well founded.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.424
(door closes)

21:50.142 --> 21:52.268
Too considerate to disturb us?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.729
Wouldn't have truck with that...

21:54.897 --> 21:56.982
room clerk ghoul to get
let into Charlie's,

21:57.149 --> 22:00.527
rather sleep in the fucking hallway,
that's the kind of man he is.

22:00.695 --> 22:03.905
Aw! I owe you
another fucking penny.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.658
I owe you another one.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.370
I don't know if you
ever should learn English,

22:10.538 --> 22:12.455
never mind foul.

22:12.623 --> 22:15.500
Spare you knowing
how ignorant people are.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.463
But then I couldn't
tell you about Bill...

22:20.631 --> 22:24.592
sleeping in the hallway
out of thought for others.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.513
And I know some other
fucking stories too--

22:29.890 --> 22:32.142
owe you another penny.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.356
Seth:
Look at that jackass.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.275
Help you with anything?

22:40.443 --> 22:43.361
I tell you who's being done
a favor at this exact moment.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.530
Or would you care to take a guess?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.240
A favor in this tent.

22:47.408 --> 22:51.244
I'd guess it's you doing one for
yourself, considering the quality goods.

22:51.412 --> 22:54.164
The favor here's being done
for Wild Bill fucking Hickok.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.749
What are you talking about?

22:55.916 --> 22:58.418
'Cause if I'm out
prospecting in the hills,

22:58.586 --> 23:00.587
then he ain't getting
his just desserts--

23:00.755 --> 23:04.007
at the poker table or otherwise.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.051
Don't ask me what I mean
by the last part.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.802
What do you mean?

23:07.970 --> 23:09.763
I said you'd do better not asking.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.431
Get outta here.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.391
I'll buy this one.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.018
What's the price on that?

23:15.186 --> 23:17.187
You ain't buying nothing.

23:18.189 --> 23:19.647
I know you.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.400
- Where I know you from?
- Can't help you with that, partner.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.944
You follow him around.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.698
Hey!

23:30.409 --> 23:31.534
(groans)

23:32.620 --> 23:35.038
That tent's shut to you.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.207
Don't come back there.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.169
Fuck you...

23:41.337 --> 23:43.963
and any plans I might've
had to buy something,

23:44.131 --> 23:46.382
or prospect.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.931
I'd be lousy at retail.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.266
I guarantee you that much.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.560
Wouldn't have the patience for it.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.896
I'm not sure how much
future he's got.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.981
Charlie:
Anyways, I want to tell you fellas,

24:02.149 --> 24:04.275
several days I'll be
going back to Cheyenne--

24:04.443 --> 24:06.778
to try and secure a mail route.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.905
I operate a freight business
outta there.

24:09.073 --> 24:12.450
You need resupply, I'll be
bringing several wagons back.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.661
That's good to know.

24:16.497 --> 24:19.582
And, uh, I was, uh,
half wondering too if...

24:19.750 --> 24:22.752
if you'd want to join
Bill and me for dinner.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.088
Tonight or some other time.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.257
Let's do it tonight.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.178
I feel like I should've brung posies.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.305
Afternoon.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.432
Can I help you find something?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.768
Mr. Swearengen wants to see ya.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.975
I only hope you understand
me being short with you

25:19.143 --> 25:21.644
- out in the street this morning.
- You had a lot on your mind.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.771
I had a lot on what's left
of my fucking mind,

25:23.939 --> 25:25.523
these new interests coming in.

25:25.691 --> 25:28.276
I only hope you understand
and see my thinking

25:28.444 --> 25:30.236
in not selling you that lot outright.

25:30.404 --> 25:31.946
What's your thinking today?

25:32.114 --> 25:35.950
Gets dead set at the fucking point,
which I like in most situations.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.291
Do you know these
new saloon interests?

25:43.459 --> 25:45.627
- Are you acquainted with them at all?
- Nope.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.712
Not them and not Bill Hickok.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.298
And all we want to do is
run a hardware business.

25:50.466 --> 25:54.510
I have got to be satisfied.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.721
See, I'm the simple-type cocksucker

25:56.889 --> 25:59.098
that when he sees lightning,
readies for thunder.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.601
And takes the thunder if it
comes from the same storm.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.603
Why wouldn't ya, Mr. Swearengen?

26:03.771 --> 26:06.564
Thank you for saying that,
even if you don't fucking mean it.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.067
What would make you
comfortable selling to us?

26:12.446 --> 26:14.072
1,000.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.575
Plus right of first refusal
on any further sale.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.410
Accepted.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.080
And right to buy back
at the original price,

26:22.248 --> 26:24.958
- plus the cost of your improvements.
- Sol: Accepted.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.751
No gambling
on the fucking premises.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.754
No association of any kind
with these Bella Union cocksuckers.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.631
- Accept--
- We can't sell 'em our goods?

26:31.799 --> 26:32.840
No.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.592
What do you think of that?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.719
Accepted.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.888
What do you think?

26:43.727 --> 26:45.520
Accepted.

26:48.899 --> 26:53.403
Or, they could buy your wares

26:53.570 --> 26:57.115
in your normal course
of your normal fucking business.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.867
I'd guess it's okay to transact
with these cocksuckers.

27:00.035 --> 27:03.037
- We can sell them our wares?
- Your normal fucking wares.

27:03.205 --> 27:05.498
No gambling, whoring or whiskey

27:05.666 --> 27:08.668
on the fucking premises
is the chief fucking point.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.003
Agreed.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.879
Al: I spit in my hand.

27:14.341 --> 27:17.051
Will that drive you
screaming into the hills?

27:24.977 --> 27:28.187
The thousand would be nice.

27:29.189 --> 27:33.985
- Sol: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.
- A happy outcome.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.445
20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

27:36.447 --> 27:38.364
A shooting exhibition!

27:38.532 --> 27:41.159
That idea for Mr. Hickok has
been had and acted upon

27:41.327 --> 27:42.827
by a few people before you.

27:42.995 --> 27:47.540
And, then afterward,
we cut the bullets out

27:47.708 --> 27:50.835
and the fucking playing cards
he was using as targets.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.962
That's the point I was trying to get to.

27:53.130 --> 27:56.257
How about the tree bark behind
the fucking playing card targets, huh?

27:56.425 --> 27:59.886
Hell, yeah,
we'll sell the fucking bark.

28:00.054 --> 28:01.929
- What do you say, fellas?
- We got our lot.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.598
Hooray for you boys.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.850
Two days for me
to get the word out.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.436
10¢ to watch, and we'll charge
for the souvenirs.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.855
I ain't taking you up on that, mister.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.066
- Another 20 for you on the quiet.
- No.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.568
And the talk between us is over.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.487
Soap!

28:17.654 --> 28:18.821
Soap with a prize inside.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.407
Soap!

28:21.575 --> 28:23.201
Got that man to sell, huh?

28:23.369 --> 28:25.661
Never had to strain so
to spend $1, 000.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.997
Will you let us outta dinner?

28:28.165 --> 28:31.000
You'd as soon not do it, huh?

28:31.168 --> 28:32.794
We'd like to get to building.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.838
Will we see you tomorrow
for breakfast?

28:36.006 --> 28:37.924
Sure.

28:38.092 --> 28:40.843
Maybe we'll catch Bill
coming back from cards.

28:41.011 --> 28:43.721
Well, congratulations
to both of you.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.348
Thanks, Mr. Utter.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.892
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.231
Looks like we're in business.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.358
Huh?

29:02.741 --> 29:05.118
My goodness.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.537
My heavens.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.330
My goodness gracious.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.710
Heavens to Betsy.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.380
What do you think, Hiram,
ever seen a craps layout?

29:17.548 --> 29:19.799
- My first.
- Shall I show you how it works?

29:19.967 --> 29:21.342
I might could follow.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.010
I do read and cipher.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.931
Well, you're well
in advance of the pack.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.683
Tell me what this says.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.018
C-O-M-E.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.603
It says "come."

29:32.771 --> 29:34.730
You really can read, can't ya?

29:34.898 --> 29:36.899
I wasn't raised to lie.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.403
(softly)
I'm liable to be killed, Eddie.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.447
He's on my scent and closing.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.116
Curious tactics,
your coming here then, EB.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.869
To remind you
secrecy is of the essence.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.662
Al Swearengen's a dangerous man.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.664
Let him doubt those he's trusted,

29:51.832 --> 29:53.458
this camp will run red with blood.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.418
Argues for raising your room rates,

29:55.586 --> 29:57.545
at least make the game
worth the candle.

29:57.713 --> 30:00.256
I wonder how cavalier
your attitude will be...

30:00.424 --> 30:02.550
with a pig gnawing through your vitals.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.760
Bet on me screaming for mercy.

30:04.928 --> 30:08.389
EB: I turned down your offer to buy
and pointed you to Artie Simpson.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.600
The whole damn extent
of my involvement.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.977
And I'm staring straight at extinction.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.272
He may get you anyway, EB,
but if your nerve goes,

30:16.440 --> 30:18.357
he'll get you sure.

30:21.612 --> 30:24.530
Now, dope is not my own
preferred form of relaxation,

30:24.698 --> 30:27.742
but I did try the shit
and believe me... I nearly converted.

30:27.910 --> 30:30.661
Jimmy said you'd do right
by me, Mr. Swearengen.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.748
Everything... that goes on
at that place.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.875
I'll give you a daily report.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.044
Yeah.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.895
Here's the type
I'd wanna know about.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.855
Just left your joint.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.941
Judas goat-looking fella.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.568
Hey, you see him?

31:02.736 --> 31:04.946
Coyote-moving type?

31:05.113 --> 31:07.156
- You see him?
- The short guy?

31:07.324 --> 31:11.994
Yeah, with his paws always damp
like a just shit fucking turd.

31:12.162 --> 31:15.164
That's the type
I'd wanna know about.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.127
Comings, goings,
any dealings with your bosses.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.129
I'll keep a special eye on him.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.131
- Al?
- Yeah.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.342
That cherry New York dude

31:26.510 --> 31:28.678
- is downstairs asking for ya.
- No good.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.888
Charlie him the fuck out.

31:37.062 --> 31:40.022
He keeps talking
about the Pinkertons.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.945
Dan Dority thought you were dead.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.489
Yes, I didn't go
to the claim this morning.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.408
You should've told him.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.536
I've had him here
the last several hours in tears.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.746
Dan, look!

31:55.914 --> 31:58.082
- He's alive.
- Thank God.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.126
Brom:
Yes, I chose not to go to the claim.

32:00.294 --> 32:01.419
Whiskey, Brom? Snatch?

32:01.587 --> 32:05.464
Frankly, Al, I'm here to speak with you.
And I'm not to be distracted.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.217
Then proceed, my son. Speak frankly.

32:08.385 --> 32:11.554
We needn't reach the question
of whether my claim has "pinched out,"

32:11.722 --> 32:14.890
as the saying goes, or whether it was
a sham proposition to begin with.

32:15.058 --> 32:18.311
Let's just say,
I've lost faith in the property.

32:18.478 --> 32:21.355
- Al: Have you?
- And I want my $20,000 back.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.733
In the heat you've confused
me with Tim Driscoll.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.944
I think we're both aware, Al,
that Driscoll's no longer in camp.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.488
And because I believe you
colluded with Tim Driscoll

32:29.656 --> 32:32.116
and perhaps were in cahoots
with other parties as well,

32:32.284 --> 32:34.285
I require satisfaction from you.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.953
It's the heat again, Brom.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.080
I don't collude and I don't cahoot.

32:38.248 --> 32:42.585
Al, are you familiar
with the Pinkerton Agency?

32:46.423 --> 32:48.758
- Why?
- Pursuing its business interests,

32:48.925 --> 32:51.844
my family's had several occasions
to engage the Pinkertons.

32:52.012 --> 32:56.223
We maintain friendly relations.
I'd prefer we settle this as gentlemen,

32:56.391 --> 32:59.894
but if need be, the Pinkertons
can be made a party to our dispute.

33:01.730 --> 33:04.357
Has he asked you to reconnoiter
the rims with him at all?

33:04.524 --> 33:07.151
- Never.
- Did he ask to and you refused?

33:07.319 --> 33:10.655
Didn't get around to it, Al.
I thought he was in for the long haul.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.698
What are you talking
about specifically?

33:12.866 --> 33:16.661
The gold you found washed down from
somewhere, that's the law of gravity.

33:16.828 --> 33:21.499
And your claim runs rim to rim
the width of the fucking gulch,

33:21.667 --> 33:24.710
so the original deposit
the gold you found washed down from

33:24.878 --> 33:28.130
is likely on your claim above,
near one of the rims.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.800
That's what you feel
I should reconnoiter?

33:30.967 --> 33:33.344
First place the Pinkertons would look.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.513
Unless I'm fucking wrong.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.973
No, that's how they operate.

33:38.141 --> 33:40.518
So if he asks you,

33:40.686 --> 33:43.145
would you reconnoiter
the rims with him?

33:43.313 --> 33:45.690
Al, I waited out there
all morning for him--

33:45.857 --> 33:47.942
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Yeah.

33:48.110 --> 33:50.611
I'd be happy to reconnoiter
the rims with him.

33:50.779 --> 33:53.114
And if Dan's and mine
good faith reconnoitering

33:53.281 --> 33:56.409
don't show the source of the gold,
do you then make restitution, Al?

33:56.576 --> 33:58.828
Or do I have recourse
to the Agency?

33:58.995 --> 34:01.997
If at that point you ask,
yes, I'll make restitution,

34:02.165 --> 34:05.710
all rights and wrongs aside, 'cause
you've got me by the fucking balls.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.878
Let me go home and change.

34:10.297 --> 34:12.591
Uh, do I need climbing gear?

34:12.759 --> 34:15.719
You might want to bring a pickaxe.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.722
Goodbye, then.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.684
Make it look like an accident.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.522
Ain't this a pretty picture?

34:26.690 --> 34:28.524
I can't wake people
I don't know about.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.694
- Passed out in the public hallway.
- He never knocked on the damn door.

34:31.862 --> 34:33.904
By the time I looked out
he was already snoring.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.322
Did you want me to drag him in
by the damn heels?

34:36.491 --> 34:40.411
I say leave him where he is
and go about your own business.

34:40.579 --> 34:44.540
He's up. I hope you're happy.
Congratulations, cocksucker.

34:44.708 --> 34:47.168
Dinner's been canceled, Bill.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.545
All right.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.714
Them two fellas got their lot bought

34:51.882 --> 34:54.507
and they're started right ahead
with the building.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.092
Sure.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.846
I was that shocked seeing
you sleeping out here, Bill.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.848
First saw you maybe an hour ago.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.267
Didn't want to disturb me
and the child, Charlie.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.562
He must've sought entry to your room,
wherever the fuck you were at.

35:06.730 --> 35:10.441
I'd like to know where that goddamned
innkeep was! He could've let Bill in.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.946
You're not gonna let me sleep, are ya?

35:16.114 --> 35:19.033
I'd have let you sleep
as long as you wanted, Bill.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.791
(sighs)

35:28.126 --> 35:30.461
- How's that little one?
- Good.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.839
She's napping.
More than I can say for you.

35:34.007 --> 35:36.759
Are those hardware boys
looking for extra hands?

35:36.927 --> 35:39.720
In a roundabout way.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.681
I don't agree with this plan.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.100
Reconnoitering the rims
is exactly the sort of

35:45.268 --> 35:47.520
due diligence that Father
would ask if I've done.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.022
Nor do I see the need
to involve your father.

35:50.190 --> 35:53.526
It was my mention of the Pinkertons,
Alma, which brought Swearengen around

35:53.693 --> 35:56.487
and the Pinkertons can't come
into this unless Father does as well.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.572
I wouldn't even know
where to look for them.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.826
Oughtn't we possibly to take
a different view of this, Brom?

36:01.993 --> 36:05.079
Consider we've had an adventure
costing us $20,000

36:05.247 --> 36:06.997
and let matters rest there.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.250
Let them rest?

36:09.417 --> 36:12.628
Yes. If you still want
to see more of the West,

36:12.796 --> 36:14.630
let's go now and see it.

36:14.798 --> 36:17.007
Or else return to New York.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.968
I don't think we should linger here.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.720
I have no abiding affection
for this camp, Alma.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.931
But I won't leave
without my money.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.232
Why do you take
that medicine?

36:33.400 --> 36:36.402
You know why,
to relieve my headaches.

36:36.570 --> 36:39.530
The other day I had a whopper
of a headache and I sampled a bit.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.448
I would hardly call

36:41.616 --> 36:45.327
the dull, numb, floating feeling
I experienced "relief."

36:50.917 --> 36:55.671
Perhaps the sexes experience
the medicine differently.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.174
In any case, I, um...

36:59.342 --> 37:01.719
hope you feel better.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.472
Thank you.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.309
(people chatting)

37:28.705 --> 37:30.706
(EB clearing throat)

37:38.798 --> 37:40.299
EB.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.135
Thanks for coming.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.970
Whistle-- (whistles)

37:45.138 --> 37:47.932
--and I'm underfoot.
Loyal as a damn dog.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.685
I tell you what, Al, you got a helluva
nice turnout downstairs.

37:51.853 --> 37:54.188
Hell of a nice Monday crowd.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.908
EB:
Jesus Christ Almighty!

38:07.535 --> 38:11.038
- Go ahead in, EB.
- I'm not in dutch, am I, Al?

38:11.206 --> 38:13.207
Go ahead in.

38:39.484 --> 38:42.194
Man:
Mr. Hickok?

38:42.362 --> 38:45.614
I'm Nathan Gordon.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.701
I come up from
Murfreesborough and...

38:48.868 --> 38:51.036
- How are you, Nathan?
- Fine.

38:51.204 --> 38:53.539
See, I'll tell you
this much, Mr. Hickok,

38:53.707 --> 38:56.041
and I'd say the same
to the angels in heaven.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.711
As a stage performer,

38:58.878 --> 39:01.296
you cannot act
a single damn lick.

39:01.464 --> 39:04.216
I'd call that a fair judgment.

39:04.384 --> 39:07.177
I saw you on a stage
in Hartford, Connecticut.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.222
And I'd have bet US currency
that you'd been strangled

39:10.390 --> 39:12.975
and killed, and you just didn't
know you was dead yet.

39:13.143 --> 39:18.105
Was you born patient, Montana,
or did you cultivate it?

39:18.273 --> 39:20.774
I guess I'm patient for labor.

39:20.942 --> 39:23.277
Now why the fuck tell him
that type story?

39:23.445 --> 39:25.696
Why, I saw him perform
with Buffalo Bill Cody

39:25.864 --> 39:29.742
and Texas Jack Omohundro
on a stage in Hartford, Connecticut.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.368
Who gives a fuck?

39:31.536 --> 39:34.788
You think he was put on Earth
to hear you run him down?

39:34.956 --> 39:36.373
I'm all right, friend.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.375
No, why don't you get
outta my sight

39:38.543 --> 39:40.919
before I do something
I'll fucking regret?

39:41.087 --> 39:43.714
I'll tell whatever kinda story
I feel like telling.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.050
That's right, tell it walking.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.928
Anyways, me and Sol are sure
grateful you and Mr. Utter

39:50.096 --> 39:51.597
are taking the time to help.

39:51.765 --> 39:54.516
Man #2: Go ahead
about your work, Mr. Hickok.

39:54.684 --> 39:56.435
He won't bother you no more.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.104
Charlie encourages me
being in your company.

39:59.272 --> 40:02.232
He feels you're a positive influence.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.444
Man #2:
No reason you'd remember me

40:05.612 --> 40:08.030
but I saw you marshal in Abilene.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.783
Saw you blow one cocksucker's head

40:10.950 --> 40:13.160
right the fuck off his neck.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.579
I also saw you...

40:15.747 --> 40:18.165
dead center three bullets
on an ace of spade

40:18.333 --> 40:20.793
playing card at 25 goddamned paces.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.921
Some other loudmouth like
this loudmouth I just sorted out

40:24.089 --> 40:27.758
said you'd doctored that playing card
before you ever tacked it to that tree.

40:27.926 --> 40:31.136
- And did you sort him out too?
- Goddamned right.

40:31.304 --> 40:33.806
Well, thanks for all that help.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.766
Now it's time you moved along.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.227
I sorted him out proper.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.438
Gouged out the both
of his fucking eyes.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.733
- Charlie: All right, friend!
- I'm tired of listening to you.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.194
You're tired of listening?

40:47.362 --> 40:49.905
- That's what he said.
- Oh.

40:50.073 --> 40:52.199
I guess everybody's
talking to me now.

40:52.367 --> 40:53.951
Get the fuck outta here!

40:54.119 --> 40:55.786
All right, I hear you, Wild Bill.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.664
You don't need to insult me twice.

41:03.628 --> 41:06.171
I'll tell you what, I hope you get
what's coming to you

41:06.339 --> 41:08.799
and I hope it's sooner
rather than later.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.635
I hope they sort you out!

41:11.803 --> 41:14.138
And I get to see it!

41:14.305 --> 41:16.849
I hope you're gut shot
and die slow!

41:17.016 --> 41:19.601
And I hope they
get you in this camp!

41:28.319 --> 41:30.571
Hand me-- hand me some
of them pegs, would you?

41:30.738 --> 41:33.323
Hey, want some pegs, Bill?

41:35.910 --> 41:37.995
I'm gonna desert you.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.589
Play some poker.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.341
Drink some whiskey.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.385
Thanks for your help.

41:53.553 --> 41:56.430
See ya later, Charlie.

41:56.598 --> 41:58.473
All right, Bill.

41:58.641 --> 42:01.268
Ready, lift.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.688
Oh, there we go.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.573
For having nothing to do with him,

42:14.741 --> 42:17.451
these hardware cocksuckers
sure seem to be joined

42:17.619 --> 42:19.119
to Hickok at the hip.

42:19.287 --> 42:21.246
You made your judgment
on that situation

42:21.414 --> 42:23.123
and I believe you judged correct.

42:23.291 --> 42:24.917
No connection
between them and him?

42:25.084 --> 42:28.712
Or between any of them
and these new saloon people?

42:28.880 --> 42:32.382
You saw it like that and I did too,
to the best of the both of our thinking.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.635
- Which was important to me.
- Which was?

42:34.802 --> 42:36.720
- What?
- When you said "which was,"

42:36.888 --> 42:38.722
I didn't follow
what you were asking.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.265
I wasn't asking nothing.

42:40.433 --> 42:43.685
I was saying.
I didn't have full information

42:43.853 --> 42:45.938
so your impression
on this was important.

42:46.105 --> 42:48.440
Someone I could trust.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.153
What's wrong?

42:53.321 --> 42:54.821
What's the matter?

42:54.989 --> 42:57.366
- My palms are damp.
- They're always damp.

42:57.533 --> 43:00.786
- Yes, sir.
- So is something wrong?

43:00.954 --> 43:03.538
No no.

43:12.048 --> 43:16.051
Well, the great prospector's
found his second wind.

43:18.888 --> 43:20.430
You tell me, Al.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.557
Have you a doubt or misgiving?

43:22.725 --> 43:24.226
You tell me.

43:24.394 --> 43:27.813
Generally, if I have
a misgiving or a doubt,

43:27.981 --> 43:31.483
I kill the cocksucker I have
a doubt and misgiving about.

43:31.651 --> 43:33.610
But these are special circumstances.

43:33.778 --> 43:36.863
I don't know what you mean
by "special circumstances."

43:37.031 --> 43:39.616
If I want to, I can burn
the whole fucking camp down.

43:39.784 --> 43:41.785
- Yes, you can.
- Cut your throat first,

43:41.953 --> 43:45.080
and then burn down
the whole fucking camp.

43:45.248 --> 43:48.583
- You can--
- So I don't know what you mean.

43:48.751 --> 43:50.752
I mean, short of burning it all down,

43:50.920 --> 43:52.963
you gotta trust someone.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.474
- What were you doing over there?
- Where?

44:04.642 --> 44:06.226
- Where?
- At the Bella Union?

44:06.394 --> 44:07.936
Get an impression, scouting.

44:08.104 --> 44:10.814
Listen to me, listen to me.

44:10.982 --> 44:14.735
I was the go-between, it was me.
But without malicious intention.

44:29.125 --> 44:30.709
Well...

44:30.877 --> 44:32.961
I confess to being winded.

44:36.049 --> 44:37.883
Oh no, Dan.

44:38.051 --> 44:39.259
No.

44:39.427 --> 44:40.969
No.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.931
Mother.

44:49.520 --> 44:53.190
Simple greed. One less hotel in camp,
shorten up the room supply.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.525
No conspiracy, no betrayal.

44:57.195 --> 45:00.030
If you're gonna murder me,
I'd appreciate a quick dying.

45:00.198 --> 45:02.324
And not getting ate by the pigs--

45:02.492 --> 45:05.327
in case there is
resurrection of the flesh.

45:12.377 --> 45:14.461
Stay friendly
with them cocksuckers.

45:14.629 --> 45:16.671
With them Bella Union people?

45:16.839 --> 45:18.882
Can't help yourself, can you?

45:28.393 --> 45:30.435
(wheezing)

45:43.866 --> 45:46.910
You fell, but you'll be all right.

45:47.078 --> 45:49.871
I'm gonna take care of you.

45:50.039 --> 45:52.040
Hold on a second.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.750
No hollering.

46:26.784 --> 46:28.368
I'll take care of you.

46:29.412 --> 46:30.787
Now, hush.

46:32.165 --> 46:34.124
(grunts)

46:38.796 --> 46:41.673
(piano music playing)

46:41.841 --> 46:45.927
Tina and Molly can be quiet
if you want him kept company.

46:46.095 --> 46:49.139
That man's already
doing all he wants to.

46:50.516 --> 46:52.517
If I send him anyone, it'd be you.

47:05.990 --> 47:07.365
Are you loaded, Leon?

47:07.533 --> 47:09.326
Well on the path, Mr. Tolliver.

47:09.494 --> 47:11.870
That man at The Gem
has got some serious shit.

47:12.038 --> 47:14.789
I know when you'd make
your first report on us to him,

47:14.957 --> 47:18.126
you'll remember to say thanks.

47:18.294 --> 47:21.880
I hope you're not too fucked up
to deal the deuce for us, Leon.

47:22.048 --> 47:24.216
Opium ain't been made yet, Mr. Sawyer,

47:24.383 --> 47:26.218
that can fuck me up that bad.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.347
I'll tug his reins.

47:30.515 --> 47:34.893
- I hope our hero wins.
- Count on it.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.110
If Bill comes,

47:44.278 --> 47:46.947
I'm gonna move you

47:47.114 --> 47:50.367
to that nice pallet over there,

47:50.535 --> 47:53.203
only 'cause he's far too big
for it and so too would I be.

47:53.371 --> 47:57.207
So if you wake up on the pallet,
that's what happened.

47:57.375 --> 47:59.042
And him and me being where we are

47:59.210 --> 48:01.211
is the circumstances
of the room, period.

48:01.379 --> 48:03.129
And the grownups are just sleeping.

48:03.297 --> 48:07.467
But don't be afraid to--
to-- to wake me up.

48:10.429 --> 48:11.805
All right.

48:16.269 --> 48:19.980
Sweetheart, go to sleep.

48:25.111 --> 48:26.736
I'm right here.

48:39.333 --> 48:42.002
Not too fucking deep, huh?

48:42.169 --> 48:43.670
I won't.

48:43.838 --> 48:45.547
Trust.

48:46.632 --> 48:48.800
Hell of a way to operate, huh?

48:48.968 --> 48:51.595
Learning at all the ins
and outs of getting killed.

48:53.681 --> 48:56.224
Not too fucking deep.

49:04.984 --> 49:07.611
Every fucking beating
I'm grateful for.

49:07.778 --> 49:09.779
Every fucking one of them.

49:10.948 --> 49:13.617
Get all the trust beat outta you.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.330
Then you know what
the fucking world is.

49:19.498 --> 49:20.624
(knocks at door)

49:20.791 --> 49:23.543
Al, open up, it's me, it's Dan!

49:25.463 --> 49:27.881
You're gonna wanna
hear this, open up!

49:32.386 --> 49:34.346
Come here, sit down.

49:45.983 --> 49:48.818
- Well, it's a mixed report.
- You just tell me, is it done?

49:48.986 --> 49:50.987
Oh, it's done.

49:51.155 --> 49:52.530
Yeah, he's gone.

49:52.698 --> 49:54.115
So what's the mixture?

49:54.283 --> 49:57.494
He went owning one hell
of a fucking gold strike.

50:05.795 --> 50:07.587
Where's the dude now?

50:07.755 --> 50:09.631
Splattered at
the bottom of the ridge.

50:09.799 --> 50:12.092
Ride back out.
Bring him back in at dawn.

50:12.259 --> 50:13.885
All right.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.809
Trixie!

50:28.150 --> 50:30.443
You want the other foot?

50:30.611 --> 50:31.903
Yeah.

50:32.071 --> 50:34.030
Please.
