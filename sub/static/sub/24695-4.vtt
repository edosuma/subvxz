00:30.270 --> 00:31.940
- Having problems
with that foot again?

00:32.008 --> 00:34.011
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:34.079 --> 00:36.881
Your alignment's all off--
I just assumed....

00:36.949 --> 00:38.215
Never mind.

00:38.283 --> 00:40.284
Thanks, background.

00:40.351 --> 00:43.451
- I told you not
to call me that.

00:43.519 --> 00:45.120
- But that's what you are.

00:45.188 --> 00:46.522
- [claps]

00:46.590 --> 00:49.526
All right, places.

00:49.594 --> 00:53.622
Ten days till curtain.
Lots of work to do.

00:53.690 --> 00:57.213
I'd like to see jessalyn
up first.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.448
Are you ready? And...
[snaps fingers]

01:02.516 --> 01:03.448
[dramatic ballet music]

01:03.516 --> 01:05.683
- Reach up. Good.

01:05.751 --> 01:08.153
Forward and back
to jete.

01:08.221 --> 01:11.322
Nice.
One, two, down, go.

01:11.390 --> 01:13.725
- [groans]
- stop. You see that?

01:13.793 --> 01:15.126
[music stops]
see how she hesitated?

01:15.194 --> 01:16.660
- But my foot--
I--

01:16.728 --> 01:19.462
- Jessalyn, no excuses.
Fall back. You're not ready.

01:19.529 --> 01:20.963
- Please,
let me try again.

01:21.030 --> 01:26.666
- You're...Not...Ready.

01:31.470 --> 01:32.937
Take over.

01:34.573 --> 01:36.673
[snaps fingers]
and...

01:36.741 --> 01:38.809
[music plays]
good.

01:38.876 --> 01:40.643
[voice on tape]
yes. Beautiful.

01:40.711 --> 01:45.013
See how she's centered
and almost floating midair?

01:45.080 --> 01:47.981
[music paused]
it's delicate and powerful

01:48.049 --> 01:49.482
All at the same time.

01:49.550 --> 01:52.017
Now, let's learn
from each other.

01:52.085 --> 01:55.087
[music plays]
riley, assess jessalyn.

01:55.155 --> 01:57.055
- Well, her legs are straining.

01:57.122 --> 01:58.856
- Fair. What else?

01:58.924 --> 02:01.024
- And her head's
not centered, so...

02:01.092 --> 02:03.059
- Her problem is that
she's terrified.

02:03.126 --> 02:04.493
I mean,
look at those eyes.

02:04.561 --> 02:05.661
She's totally holding back.

02:05.728 --> 02:08.529
- Okay, and why do you think
that is?

02:08.597 --> 02:13.666
- She blames everything--
her foot, all of us.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.201
She needs to just suck it up
and do the work herself.

02:24.508 --> 02:26.542
[jessalyn breathing
erratically]

02:26.610 --> 02:28.677
- Jessalyn, it's okay.

02:28.744 --> 02:31.445
- It's bad enough my parents
diss me all the time.

02:31.513 --> 02:33.347
Now her!

02:33.414 --> 02:35.849
- No, no, it will get better.
You'll see.

02:35.916 --> 02:38.951
- No...
Not while that bitch is here.

02:41.254 --> 02:42.654
[passionate breathing]
- you're so good.

02:42.721 --> 02:43.688
You're so good.

02:43.755 --> 02:45.656
- Yeah, I know.
- You're so good.

02:45.724 --> 02:47.024
You're so good.
- I know.

02:47.091 --> 02:49.926
- You're so good.
[moaning]

02:49.993 --> 02:52.561
[catching breath]

02:54.797 --> 02:56.764
Stay with me.
- I can't.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.534
- Who--
who is it this time?

03:01.602 --> 03:03.936
That wannabe dj kid?

03:04.004 --> 03:06.705
- You don't own me.

03:06.772 --> 03:09.573
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I upsetting you?

03:09.641 --> 03:14.110
- It's just that I'd hate
for this to end badly.

03:38.664 --> 03:42.366
- Who is this? Huh?
Who is this?

03:42.434 --> 03:44.801
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Let's go.

03:44.869 --> 03:46.369
- Let go of me.
- Let's go!

03:46.437 --> 03:47.804
- Let go of me!

03:47.872 --> 03:49.305
- Let's go.

03:49.373 --> 03:50.573
- Cole, let go of me!

03:50.641 --> 03:52.941
- Aah!
Get in the car.

03:53.009 --> 03:55.209
- Let go of me.

03:56.311 --> 03:58.111
Don't ever grab me
like that again.

03:58.179 --> 04:00.079
- Who the hell is this "e"
calling you?

04:00.147 --> 04:02.114
- It doesn't matter.

04:02.182 --> 04:03.382
- Long as we're together,
it does!

04:03.450 --> 04:05.283
- We're done.

04:05.351 --> 04:06.550
- What do you mean we're done?
Come here.

04:06.618 --> 04:10.553
[laughing]
come and catch me.

04:10.621 --> 04:12.621
- Aah!

04:12.689 --> 04:13.755
- [laughing]

04:13.823 --> 04:17.523
- [grunts]
alona. Alona!

04:32.032 --> 04:34.199
[clatter]

04:40.304 --> 04:41.905
- What now?

05:12.406 --> 05:15.906
Sub by Adriano_CSI
http://www.addic7ed.com/

05:57.707 --> 05:59.807
- Custodians found her
around 7:00 a.M.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.109
She's a student here
at the schuman.

06:01.176 --> 06:03.243
Her name's alona landau.

06:03.311 --> 06:05.312
- [sniffing]
hmm.

06:05.380 --> 06:08.182
She was doing
some heavy drinking last night.

06:08.249 --> 06:11.818
Yeah, she reeks
of alcohol.

06:11.886 --> 06:14.355
- There's an obvious blow
from something with an edge.

06:14.422 --> 06:17.491
- Mm-hmm.
- Her clothes are intact.

06:17.558 --> 06:18.691
Slight bruising
on the pelvic bone,

06:18.759 --> 06:20.393
But no blood,
no obvious signs of rape.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.094
- All right,
look at these legs.

06:22.162 --> 06:25.532
Very well-toned
and muscular.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.001
Looks like a dancer.

06:27.069 --> 06:28.436
T.O.D.?

06:28.504 --> 06:30.237
- Well, by rigor
and lividity,

06:30.305 --> 06:31.738
I would guess between 1:00
and 4:00 a.M.

06:31.806 --> 06:35.609
Look how she's flat on her back,
body almost concave.

06:35.677 --> 06:37.978
Landed
with the velocity of--

06:38.046 --> 06:41.382
- Of somebody
who was pushed.

06:41.450 --> 06:42.650
- I'm guessing she knew them.

06:42.718 --> 06:43.750
- Yeah, she must have known
a whole bunch of people

06:43.818 --> 06:46.720
Right here at the schuman.

06:46.787 --> 06:48.755
A good place to start.

06:48.822 --> 06:50.756
- Get it done. Go.
Do it now.

06:50.824 --> 06:52.958
- Excuse me,
is this your class?

06:53.025 --> 06:55.060
- Ethan johns,
department head.

06:55.128 --> 06:57.362
I'm pretty busy.
What's up?

06:57.430 --> 07:01.399
- Your student, alona landau,
was murdered

07:01.467 --> 07:03.834
On campus last night.

07:06.504 --> 07:08.404
- Let's, uh,
talk somewhere private.

07:08.472 --> 07:09.472
- Shall we?

07:13.943 --> 07:16.712
- So gifted.

07:16.779 --> 07:19.316
I can't believe this.

07:19.383 --> 07:22.452
- Some people might have
envied her...Gift.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.987
Anybody that you'd describe
as her enemy?

07:25.055 --> 07:27.956
- People come here
to perfect their art.

07:28.024 --> 07:30.458
And students clash
as part of the process.

07:30.526 --> 07:33.560
- I see. Was clashing part
of yesterday's process?

07:33.628 --> 07:36.229
- We had evaluations,
rehearsals...

07:36.297 --> 07:38.264
Everything was fine.
Are we about done?

07:38.331 --> 07:41.033
I have a roomful of students
I have to deal with.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.769
- We'll be done when you tell us
what you did last night.

07:43.837 --> 07:46.204
- [chuckles]

07:46.272 --> 07:50.875
I'm done when I decide
to stop speaking.

07:50.942 --> 07:52.108
But in the interest
of cooperation,

07:52.176 --> 07:55.044
I was here,
as I am every night,

07:55.112 --> 07:57.146
Honing our performance.

07:57.214 --> 07:59.348
- Was there anybody with you?
- Yes.

07:59.416 --> 08:01.850
My set designer,
till about 2:00 a.M.

08:04.688 --> 08:07.055
Now, I have a roomful
of dancers

08:07.123 --> 08:09.257
Who need me more
than you do.

08:14.797 --> 08:17.466
- "people come here
to perfect their art."

08:17.534 --> 08:19.001
What a pompous idiot.

08:19.069 --> 08:22.571
- Yeah, let's,
let's go see how alona lived

08:22.639 --> 08:25.307
While perfecting her art.

08:30.781 --> 08:33.182
- Well, I owe my daughter
an apology.

08:33.250 --> 08:36.317
Her room is pristine
next to this.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.652
What's that smell?

08:37.719 --> 08:39.751
There's a sickly sweet smell,
like rotten fruit.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.052
- Yeah, it's something--
what is that?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.354
It's like, uh...
Is it cheap rfume?

08:43.421 --> 08:46.087
- I don't think so.
She shopped like an heiress,

08:46.155 --> 08:47.255
Not a student.

08:47.323 --> 08:49.557
You got chanel,
hermes, la mer.

08:49.624 --> 08:51.224
- Huh...

08:51.291 --> 08:55.492
- Hmm...What's this?

08:55.559 --> 08:57.525
Someone was stroking
this girl's

08:57.593 --> 08:58.926
Already healthy
self-esteem.

08:58.994 --> 09:00.692
Clearly, she thought
a lot of herself.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.524
- Well, you have to,
getting into a school like this.

09:03.592 --> 09:04.858
- I almost went here myself.

09:04.926 --> 09:06.592
My parents considered me
a piano prodigy.

09:06.660 --> 09:08.661
- Must've been fun.

09:08.729 --> 09:10.262
- Uh, it was tolerable,

09:10.329 --> 09:11.762
If you exclude
command performances

09:11.830 --> 09:13.496
At all their cocktail parties.

09:13.563 --> 09:15.630
- Ooh.

09:17.331 --> 09:19.264
- [sniffs]

09:19.332 --> 09:22.267
What is that--
a vomit stain.

09:24.337 --> 09:25.470
What's all this?
What, is she fighting

09:25.537 --> 09:27.738
A flu or a stomach thing?

09:27.806 --> 09:29.706
- I'd guess purging.
I had a good friend who danced.

09:29.774 --> 09:31.407
What they do
to their bodies,

09:31.475 --> 09:33.310
They practically torture
themselves.

09:33.378 --> 09:36.881
- Yeah?
Well, not tortured enough

09:36.949 --> 09:39.084
To skip a party.

09:41.589 --> 09:44.925
So  leco...Cole?

09:44.993 --> 09:49.496
We understand that you were at
this club last night with alona,

09:49.564 --> 09:51.998
And the bouncer there
told us that

09:52.066 --> 09:53.833
You got a little bit, uh,
rough.

09:53.901 --> 09:55.734
- He said she was kicking
and screaming,

09:55.802 --> 09:58.036
Trying to get away from you.
- I don't care what he said.

09:58.104 --> 10:00.071
I loved alona.
- Your love do that?

10:00.139 --> 10:01.740
Looks pretty fresh.

10:01.807 --> 10:04.542
- What we had together
was hot.

10:04.609 --> 10:08.044
- Hmm, so if we find your dna,
no surprise.

10:08.112 --> 10:11.012
- Look, there was some guy
named "e"

10:11.080 --> 10:13.514
That kept calling her
over at the club.

10:13.582 --> 10:14.849
That's why we fought.

10:14.916 --> 10:17.551
- Oh, that's
a nice jacket, eh?

10:17.618 --> 10:21.553
Jeez, it looks like a tear.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.421
A little scrape.
This happen during the fight?

10:23.489 --> 10:25.422
- Tore it when I fell over
a curb.

10:25.490 --> 10:26.690
- Right.

10:26.758 --> 10:29.092
- Before I came home,
I went to il vento's.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.527
They know me at the bar.
I was there for a while.

10:31.595 --> 10:33.729
- We're going to take this.
Okay? Thank you.

10:33.796 --> 10:36.364
- Look, I didn't do this.

10:36.432 --> 10:37.998
All right?

10:38.066 --> 10:39.199
I cared about alona.

10:39.267 --> 10:40.867
I gave her something
that no one

10:40.935 --> 10:42.601
At that school ever could.

10:42.669 --> 10:44.503
- Oh, yeah?
What's that?

10:46.672 --> 10:48.472
- I gave her freedom.

10:53.643 --> 10:56.678
- C.O.D. Was a puncture wound
to the skull.

10:56.746 --> 10:58.479
Brain hemorrhaging was
so severe

10:58.547 --> 11:00.815
That the impact with the ground
just finished the job.

11:00.883 --> 11:03.417
- Thoughts
on the wound pattern?

11:03.484 --> 11:06.519
- Well, it's a deep fracture
consistent with a sharp blow.

11:06.587 --> 11:07.921
Tools and debris
left at the scene

11:07.988 --> 11:09.588
Would have left
a larger bruise.

11:09.656 --> 11:11.223
- Right.
This has a direct--

11:11.290 --> 11:13.357
Direct point of entry.

11:13.425 --> 11:15.726
Why is that?
It's like it's the--

11:15.793 --> 11:18.494
It was just the tip--
the tip of something.

11:18.562 --> 11:20.495
- Mm-hmm. Something metal
and very heavy.

11:20.563 --> 11:22.397
- What did the tox screen say?

11:22.465 --> 11:24.599
- Large quantities of alcohol,
no drugs.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.468
But she'd been vomiting
for a few weeks.

11:27.536 --> 11:28.936
The stomach lining's inflamed,

11:29.004 --> 11:30.470
And there are acid stains
on her teeth.

11:30.538 --> 11:32.472
- Have you done a full panel?

11:32.540 --> 11:35.241
- Yeah, it's in the works.
Could take a few days.

11:35.309 --> 11:41.646
But I did managed to pull
two semen samples.

11:41.714 --> 11:43.247
- So you don't like
the boyfriend as the killer.

11:43.315 --> 11:44.581
- Il vento's gives him
an alibi

11:44.649 --> 11:46.182
That pretty much covers
the time of death.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.852
- Cole talked about calls
she got from someone named "e."

11:48.919 --> 11:51.253
Now, alona landau's phone
records show six calls

11:51.321 --> 11:52.922
From ethan johns last night--

11:52.989 --> 11:54.823
One close to the time
of her death.

11:54.891 --> 11:55.924
- Did he offer an alibi?

11:55.991 --> 11:57.158
- Well, he said he worked
till 2:00

11:57.226 --> 11:58.359
"honing a performance."

11:58.426 --> 12:00.093
Set designer confirms it.

12:00.161 --> 12:02.162
- I still think we should get
a dna sample from him.

12:02.229 --> 12:03.163
- It's not gonna be voluntary.

12:03.230 --> 12:04.364
Last time we talked to him,

12:04.432 --> 12:05.932
He was about half an inch
from lawyering up.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.835
- So? You must know
a friendly judge.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.803
- Oh, yeah, a dance instructor
who hits on his students...

12:11.871 --> 12:15.072
We'll get a subpoena.

[dramatic piano music]

12:36.860 --> 12:40.463

12:40.531 --> 12:43.366
- [sighs]
my foot!

12:43.434 --> 12:45.369
I still get scared.

12:45.437 --> 12:46.804
- There's nothing
to be afraid of, okay?

12:46.872 --> 12:48.706
You can hit that
without an extra step.

12:48.773 --> 12:50.542
- You're so confident.

12:50.610 --> 12:54.546
- Hey, come here.
Come here.

12:54.614 --> 12:58.212
All my confidence, okay?
It's yours.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.280
I'm giving it to you
right now.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.284
Right now.
Can you feel that?

13:03.351 --> 13:05.386
Okay? Okay?

13:05.454 --> 13:07.889
And now, take it.
Go on. Go on.

13:07.957 --> 13:11.093
Starting from the previous
measure, all right?

13:11.161 --> 13:14.297
Okay.

- [laughing]

13:26.309 --> 13:28.310
- Yes. Yes!
Look at you!

13:28.377 --> 13:32.379
[laughing and chattering]

13:38.678 --> 13:40.112
- He might be demanding,

13:40.179 --> 13:43.181
But mr. Johns is generous
with his time.

13:43.249 --> 13:44.816
His door is always open.

13:44.884 --> 13:46.017
- And his time is only
about dance?

13:46.085 --> 13:48.284
- Yes.

13:48.351 --> 13:50.618
- What is that, for the--
the tummy?

13:50.686 --> 13:52.920
You okay?
- I'm fine.

13:52.988 --> 13:54.755
- Riley, we need
the true picture here.

13:54.823 --> 13:56.323
- Look, I've said
what I know.

13:56.391 --> 13:57.924
I can't get involved.

13:57.992 --> 14:00.126
- Oh, riley,
you're already involved.

14:00.194 --> 14:02.395
Everybody knows
you're talking to us.

14:02.462 --> 14:07.933
What do you suppose they imagine
that you're saying?

14:08.001 --> 14:09.701
- There was a bad scene
the day alona was killed.

14:09.769 --> 14:12.170
It's very competitive.

14:12.238 --> 14:14.772
Only with alona and jessalyn,
it was more than that.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.142
- Jessalyn...
- Jessalyn kerr.

14:18.209 --> 14:19.543
- Kerr?
What, the two of them, uh--

14:19.611 --> 14:22.546
There was tension?
- They were always fighting.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.014
Trying to one-up
each other.

14:24.081 --> 14:27.016
Jessalyn started getting
really paranoid.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.217
- About what?

14:29.285 --> 14:30.585
- She hurt her foot
a while back--

14:30.653 --> 14:32.020
Cut it real bad
on something,

14:32.087 --> 14:34.355
And started saying
alona did it.

14:34.422 --> 14:38.559
Maybe rigged her shoes.

14:38.627 --> 14:42.028
[mellow piano music]

<i>Brahms' symphony no. 3.</i>

15:07.581 --> 15:10.050
- Not brahms.
I wrote it.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.251
- You wrote that?
[chuckles]

15:12.319 --> 15:15.854
Well, you know, you may have
altered it slightly.

15:15.922 --> 15:18.423
Here, take mr. Brahms'
opening phrase--

15:18.491 --> 15:19.491
It goes like this.

15:19.558 --> 15:22.193
[humming and playing notes]

15:22.261 --> 15:23.294
And I think you did this.

[hums, plays slightly
altered version]

15:29.400 --> 15:33.702
So what is that,
writing or appropriation?

15:33.770 --> 15:34.903
What do you think, peanut?

15:34.971 --> 15:37.271
- I'll find mr. Johns.

15:37.339 --> 15:40.874
- No, we're actually here
to see jessalyn.

15:40.942 --> 15:42.009
- Me? Why?

15:42.077 --> 15:45.446
- I'll be right outside.

15:50.851 --> 15:52.018
- So, jessalyn kerr,

15:52.086 --> 15:55.654
We heard that you
and alona landau were, uh--

15:55.722 --> 15:57.022
Were fightin'.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.522
- It wasn't a fight.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.790
She crossed a line
during truth circle.

16:00.858 --> 16:02.124
- Truth circle?

16:02.192 --> 16:05.027
- When we watch rehearsal tapes
and critique each other.

16:05.094 --> 16:09.130
- Oh, that sounds,
uh, cold.

16:09.198 --> 16:11.532
- It's just a part
of the creative process.

16:11.599 --> 16:14.768
But alona made it
personal.

16:14.835 --> 16:16.035
Especially with me.

16:16.103 --> 16:19.039
- So you don't deny that
you two were rivals?

16:19.107 --> 16:20.540
- Alona was everyone's rival.

16:20.608 --> 16:21.575
But that's the way
she wanted it.

16:21.642 --> 16:24.043
Look, I was
in my dorm room

16:24.110 --> 16:25.310
All night that night.

16:25.378 --> 16:27.645
You can check
with my r.A., okay?

16:27.713 --> 16:30.313
- [claps hands]
jess, you're late for stretch.

16:36.186 --> 16:37.953
I'll tolerate
the disruptive efforts

16:38.020 --> 16:39.086
Aimed at my person,

16:39.154 --> 16:41.287
But try not to impact
these young people

16:41.355 --> 16:44.857
And their dedication
to art.

16:47.326 --> 16:50.995
- That doesn't
make him guilty.

16:51.063 --> 16:53.564
- A first-rate athlete
smashed on the head

16:53.632 --> 16:54.932
And tossed two stories
to the ground?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.100
- All right.

16:56.167 --> 16:57.801
- Easy task for
a well-toned dance instructor.

16:57.869 --> 17:00.937
- Or--or another
first-rate athlete.

17:01.005 --> 17:03.573
The schuman is
intensely competitive, right?

17:03.641 --> 17:05.707
These girls are under
a lot of pressure.

17:05.775 --> 17:09.179
It's not a stretch to imagine
that one of them just cracked.

17:09.247 --> 17:10.280
- I'm not denying that.

17:10.347 --> 17:11.646
I know how teenage girls
can be.

17:11.714 --> 17:13.751
All the wild emotions,
the crazy insecurities.

17:13.818 --> 17:15.821
- That's right.
And this murder was impetuous

17:15.888 --> 17:17.089
And passionate.

17:17.156 --> 17:19.957
Ethan johns, he's like
the choreographer type.

17:20.023 --> 17:21.791
You know, those guys are
into order and control.

17:21.859 --> 17:24.359
- Right. Which gives him
all the power.

17:24.428 --> 17:26.596
I think he couldn't control
alona, so he snapped.

17:26.663 --> 17:29.898
- Why are you so certain
about this guy's guilt?

17:29.966 --> 17:32.234
- In my first year
of college,

17:32.301 --> 17:35.603
I thought I could
do anything, be with anyone.

17:35.671 --> 17:38.072
I was dumb enough
to get involved with someone

17:38.139 --> 17:43.009
Who was talented
and charming and...

17:43.076 --> 17:46.678
Anyway, I'll go talk
to callas.

17:46.746 --> 17:48.315
We should get
the rehearsal tapes and records

17:48.383 --> 17:50.784
On all the students
from the schuman.

17:50.851 --> 17:52.618
And I'm checking priors.

17:52.686 --> 17:55.354
I'm betting ethan johns
has a history.

17:59.191 --> 18:04.562
- You seem the least disturbed
by recent events.

18:04.630 --> 18:06.731
That's a tribute
to your dedication.

18:16.073 --> 18:18.007
You'll take alona's role
next week.

18:18.074 --> 18:19.975
- [gasps]

18:20.042 --> 18:21.409
[chuckles]

18:21.477 --> 18:22.877
Really?

18:22.945 --> 18:26.280
- You're ready, jessalyn.
It's time.

18:26.347 --> 18:27.447
- Yeah.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.920
- Alona's movement
was superior,

18:33.987 --> 18:38.624
But you're far more
beautiful.

18:38.691 --> 18:41.026
And with my help...

18:41.094 --> 18:44.463
You'll be a star.

18:46.666 --> 18:48.567
- I won't disappoint you.

18:48.634 --> 18:50.836
I swear.

18:59.578 --> 19:03.114
I sent you my feelings when
he told me I was dancing lead.

19:03.182 --> 19:05.250
- I felt him coming on
to you,

19:05.318 --> 19:07.052
Like I knew just
what you were going through

19:07.119 --> 19:08.119
Right at that moment.

19:08.187 --> 19:10.422
- I knew you were thinking
of me too.

19:10.489 --> 19:12.791
- Nobody has what we have.

19:12.859 --> 19:15.594
- We're so close.
Sometimes it's like...

19:15.661 --> 19:17.128
Both: We're the same person.

19:17.196 --> 19:20.865
- Yes.

19:20.933 --> 19:23.134
[laughter]

19:23.201 --> 19:26.570
- Oh, this is so amazing!
We have to celebrate.

19:26.638 --> 19:29.807
- Mm. Ugh...I forgot!

19:29.874 --> 19:31.776
I have this stupid dinner thing
with my parents.

19:31.844 --> 19:34.178
- I thought you hated
your parents.

19:34.246 --> 19:35.746
- I do, but they pay
for all this,

19:35.814 --> 19:38.516
So I have to play nice
once in a while.

19:38.583 --> 19:42.353
- Oh, um...
Yeah, all right.

19:42.420 --> 19:45.956
Well, okay, we'll just
celebrate some other time.

19:46.024 --> 19:47.825
- What are you talking about?

19:47.893 --> 19:51.461
If I'm stuck with them,
so are you.

19:51.529 --> 19:53.696
[giggles]

20:11.010 --> 20:12.307
- Priors?

20:12.375 --> 20:14.072
- Nothing.

20:14.140 --> 20:16.337
- You know, sometimes
we hate the innocent

20:16.405 --> 20:17.603
And like the guilty.

20:17.671 --> 20:19.968
- He's a bad guy.

20:20.035 --> 20:21.934
- But here--

20:22.000 --> 20:24.301
Here, I found this student
with history--

20:24.369 --> 20:25.936
Paulette bartol.

20:26.003 --> 20:29.271
We met her with jessalyn.

20:29.339 --> 20:33.007
This says, basically,
that she has been troubled.

20:33.075 --> 20:36.776
- Not bad trouble if the schuman
still let her in.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.078
- Well, she could have--

20:38.145 --> 20:39.646
On the application,
she could have concealed that.

20:39.713 --> 20:41.414
- But I reviewed
the dorm files.

20:41.481 --> 20:43.615
Both were checked in
by 10:30 that night.

20:43.683 --> 20:45.250
- Oh, yeah, but sneaking out
of your college dorm--

20:45.317 --> 20:46.651
[cell phone ringing]

20:46.718 --> 20:48.352
For creative students,
that's, uh--

20:48.420 --> 20:50.387
That's no houdini move,
you know.

20:50.454 --> 20:53.557
- Ethan johns' mitochondrial dna
matches one

20:53.625 --> 20:55.659
Of the two semen samples.

20:55.726 --> 20:57.827
He doesn't need priors.

20:57.895 --> 20:59.228
We have physical evidence,

20:59.296 --> 21:00.997
Witness testimony,
phone records.

21:01.064 --> 21:03.800
It's all here.

21:07.741 --> 21:11.446
- Okay.
Let's run it by the d.A.

21:11.514 --> 21:16.121
And see if we can get
an arrest warrant.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.161
[door slams shut]

21:23.230 --> 21:24.597
- Your alibi checks out.

21:24.665 --> 21:26.231
- Of course.

21:26.299 --> 21:27.699
I was working on
finishing the sets

21:27.767 --> 21:29.100
Until 2:00 in the morning.

21:29.168 --> 21:31.603
- Right, and then
you were working on...

21:31.670 --> 21:34.939
Miss cynthia tussley...
Till well after 7:30.

21:35.006 --> 21:37.574
You know, you have an affair
with a rich socialite,

21:37.642 --> 21:40.143
And then word gets out
that you're being questioned...

21:40.211 --> 21:44.181
- Suddenly her attorney calls
wanting to protect his client.

21:44.249 --> 21:45.516
Humiliating.

21:45.583 --> 21:48.018
- [chuckling]

21:48.086 --> 21:50.954
- I can see why you'd like
to keep it a secret.

21:51.022 --> 21:53.490
- It doesn't matter.

21:53.558 --> 21:55.893
It's not a crime.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.228
You can't hold me.

22:00.932 --> 22:05.835
- I know it's one role,
but things are changing.

22:05.903 --> 22:09.038
I'll probably be dancing lead
from now on.

22:09.106 --> 22:11.006
- Just don't get ahead
of yourself.

22:11.074 --> 22:12.741
You know how dramatic
you can be.

22:12.809 --> 22:16.377
- Still a long road
before abt.

22:16.445 --> 22:17.745
- Mm. There's more foie gras,
paulette.

22:17.813 --> 22:19.580
- Um, I'm fine, thank you.

22:19.648 --> 22:21.782
- You know we can't eat
this crap!

22:21.850 --> 22:23.416
- Excuse me?

22:23.484 --> 22:25.351
- I'm two pounds over.

22:25.419 --> 22:28.421
Maybe if you cared at all,
you'd know that.

22:28.488 --> 22:30.456
- This is not the time
or the place.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.758
- Since I was five, I've dreamed
of being a dancer.

22:32.825 --> 22:34.993
That's all I've wanted.

22:35.060 --> 22:37.361
All you do is ruin it
and make it ugly.

22:37.429 --> 22:41.064
But ethan johns believes in me,
even if you don't.

22:41.132 --> 22:42.766
That's all that matters.

22:49.939 --> 22:54.975
Paulette, I'll wait here
all night if I have to.

22:58.312 --> 22:59.812
- [crying]
I did it all for you.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.113
I did it all for you!

23:01.181 --> 23:04.716
- Slow down.
Just talk to me.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.885
- You were supposed
to be happy!

23:07.953 --> 23:09.820
<i>I just wanted
to make you happy!</i>

23:09.888 --> 23:12.422
Because I thought that
if you were happy,

23:12.489 --> 23:15.424
Then we could
be happy together.

23:15.492 --> 23:18.727
But it's all wrong!

23:18.795 --> 23:22.431
Everything's wrong!

23:22.498 --> 23:24.499
Now you're gonna go
with ethan,

23:24.567 --> 23:26.334
And I'm gonna
be alone again!

23:30.438 --> 23:36.042
I'm gonna
be alone again.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.477
But I did it for you,
jessalyn.

23:38.545 --> 23:41.847
I did it for you.

23:41.915 --> 23:44.649
Please say something.

23:44.717 --> 23:47.284
- I don't have to.

23:47.352 --> 23:51.989
You know what I'm feeling.

24:01.016 --> 24:02.616
- That was beautiful.
Beautiful.

24:02.684 --> 24:05.319
Very good.

24:05.386 --> 24:07.787
- So we've got physical
evidence, phone records,

24:07.855 --> 24:09.856
A dominating personality,

24:09.923 --> 24:11.857
But a witness who places him
somewhere else.

24:11.925 --> 24:13.692
- The dna may not
get him indicted,

24:13.760 --> 24:14.826
But it could serve
another purpose.

24:14.894 --> 24:16.528
- A guy like him,

24:16.596 --> 24:17.796
Feeling empowered,
as he does,

24:17.863 --> 24:20.298
There could be more than
one student in his past.

24:20.366 --> 24:23.401
Riley thorson got
a little jumpy

24:23.468 --> 24:25.269
When we brought up
his name.

24:26.236 --> 24:27.837
- Yeah, don't release him
just yet.

24:27.905 --> 24:31.373
And see if she's willing
to talk.

24:31.441 --> 24:35.343
- Let's skip right to it.
Were you sleeping with him?

24:35.410 --> 24:37.678
- It was six months ago.

24:37.746 --> 24:41.015
Before he took up
with alona.

24:41.083 --> 24:42.850
I'm so embarrassed.

24:42.917 --> 24:45.319
[gasps]

24:45.386 --> 24:47.120
- Uh, what's the matter?
You okay?

24:47.188 --> 24:48.488
- Just this stomach thing.

24:48.556 --> 24:50.691
It comes and goes.
Everyone's got it.

24:50.758 --> 24:54.527
- Maybe food poisoning?
- That's what my doctor said.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.862
But I don't know...
It feels different.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.530
- Different like what?

24:58.597 --> 25:00.764
- I'm wheezing
all the time.

25:00.832 --> 25:04.701
And I can't get rid
of this really weird taste.

25:04.769 --> 25:06.769
- Strange.
Let me smell your breath.

25:08.605 --> 25:10.005
- Okay, I guess.

25:10.072 --> 25:11.206
- Do, like, a...
[exhales quickly].

25:11.273 --> 25:13.807
- Breathe out for me.
- [exhales]

25:18.178 --> 25:20.779
- Smell her breath.
Smell her breath.

25:20.847 --> 25:23.515
- [exhales]
- [sniffs]

25:25.416 --> 25:27.516
Yeah, I know that smell.

25:27.584 --> 25:29.984
- It's from alona's room.

25:30.051 --> 25:32.352
- What is it?

25:32.419 --> 25:34.920
- Ethylene glycol is
a dihydroxy alcohol derivative.

25:34.988 --> 25:36.354
- It's antifreeze.

25:36.422 --> 25:37.789
- It was masked
in the first tox screen

25:37.856 --> 25:38.990
Because she'd been drinking.

25:39.058 --> 25:41.425
- Mm.
- Just how elevated was she?

25:41.493 --> 25:42.660
- Well, trace amounts.

25:42.727 --> 25:46.162
But even a small mouthful
can throw the body off.

25:46.230 --> 25:48.930
Skin goes pale,
breath rate increases.

25:48.998 --> 25:50.832
- Pale skin, breath--
riley thorson.

25:50.900 --> 25:54.568
And, according to her,
everyone else.

25:54.636 --> 25:59.777
Jessalyn kerr
and paulette bartol...

25:59.845 --> 26:02.080
They didn't mention it.

26:02.148 --> 26:05.783
- [laughing]
this is so crazy!

26:05.851 --> 26:08.853
In one week,
I'll be dancing lead.

26:08.921 --> 26:11.188
[giggles]

26:11.256 --> 26:12.189
Can you believe it?

26:12.257 --> 26:14.258
- The world is yours.

26:14.325 --> 26:18.127
- No, ours.
The world is ours.

26:21.898 --> 26:23.765
What's in there, anyway?

26:23.833 --> 26:25.933
Can I see?

26:26.001 --> 26:28.602
- Well, I'll show you
a few things.

26:28.669 --> 26:29.736
- [chuckles]

26:29.804 --> 26:32.105
Hmm.

26:35.810 --> 26:38.846
"today is the day.
I've never felt more free.

26:38.914 --> 26:42.218
Because I know now
what I must do."

26:45.622 --> 26:50.525
Uh, is this the day you...

26:53.396 --> 26:54.963
What if someone finds out?

26:55.031 --> 26:58.167
- Hey, come here.

26:58.235 --> 27:01.470
Nobody knows anything, okay?
She's gone.

27:01.538 --> 27:05.307
Gone.

27:05.375 --> 27:09.544
[laughter]

27:11.380 --> 27:12.780
- Paulette bartol
may be talented,

27:12.848 --> 27:14.615
But she's also
emotionally unstable.

27:14.682 --> 27:16.183
- She was kicked out
of high school

27:16.251 --> 27:18.151
For stalking
another student.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.052
- And her latest obsession,
jessalyn kerr,

27:20.120 --> 27:21.487
Was the victim's rival.

27:21.554 --> 27:22.754
- I thought the school backed
their alibis.

27:22.822 --> 27:24.923
- Bed check had them
in their rooms.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.659
- We're not happy with that.

27:26.726 --> 27:28.394
- Well, jessalyn has
a past drug problem.

27:28.461 --> 27:30.663
She requires a second bed check
from the resident advisors.

27:30.730 --> 27:32.798
They confirm she was in
all night.

27:32.866 --> 27:33.832
- Yeah, she was in.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.637
But paulette bartol...
Different story.

27:36.704 --> 27:39.439
Look at this.
Look at the tv.

27:39.507 --> 27:41.942
Watch this.
Okay, teacher ethan.

27:42.009 --> 27:44.144
Paulette bartol,
she has that tray of drinks.

27:44.211 --> 27:46.946
She gives one to poor alona,
to this other girl in the pink.

27:47.014 --> 27:50.049
And now she gives one
to jessalyn, and no--

27:50.116 --> 27:53.151
She gives her water.
Water, okay?

27:53.219 --> 27:56.189
Those sweet, sugary
sports drinks

27:56.256 --> 27:58.791
Could cover the sweet taste
of ethylene glycol,

27:58.859 --> 28:01.060
But you can't hide that
in water.

28:01.128 --> 28:05.398
- She poisoned everyone
but jessalyn.

28:05.466 --> 28:08.234
Good. That's very good.

28:08.302 --> 28:10.802
So go on. Go see what else
she might be hiding.

28:14.103 --> 28:16.503
So it was around 11:45. Ok,

28:16.504 --> 28:20.504
so it turns out Paula was
 a no show at classes today 

28:20.505 --> 28:23.404
and Jessalyn father
pulled her out of school.

28:32.224 --> 28:33.527
- What's this?

28:33.594 --> 28:34.963
What's in here?

28:39.931 --> 28:41.233
You see all that?

28:41.301 --> 28:44.602
Paulette has no idea that
she's being so helpful.

28:44.670 --> 28:47.571
- You think?
I'm gonna check the bathroom.

29:21.271 --> 29:23.706
Hey, you should get in here.

29:26.210 --> 29:28.746
- What's up?
- Wastebasket.

29:28.813 --> 29:31.549
Had receipts for antifreeze.

29:49.134 --> 29:53.437
- I don't think
that's all we've got.

29:53.505 --> 29:55.606
- You can't do this.

29:55.674 --> 29:57.742
I will kill myself
if you keep me from paulette.

29:57.809 --> 30:01.179
- You will not
be seeing her anymore!

30:01.246 --> 30:04.782
- Honey,
it's for your own good.

30:04.850 --> 30:07.619
[gasps]
oh, god!

30:07.687 --> 30:09.888
- I can't believe
you just did that.

30:09.956 --> 30:11.789
I'm calling paulette.
This is--

30:11.857 --> 30:13.690
- No contact.
Do you hear me?

30:13.758 --> 30:16.257
None!

30:19.327 --> 30:22.829
- Oh, I hate you!

30:49.619 --> 30:51.453
[knock on window]

30:55.725 --> 30:57.992
How did you get here?
- Hi.

31:02.363 --> 31:03.730
- I was thinking about you.

31:03.798 --> 31:05.231
I'd hoped you'd come
and get me.

31:05.299 --> 31:07.333
- I knew you needed me.
- Let's run away somewhere.

31:07.401 --> 31:09.668
- Anywhere you want to go.
- I have a trust.

31:09.736 --> 31:11.236
I can get money.
- No, no, it's okay.

31:11.304 --> 31:14.172
As long as we're together...
- Nothing can stop us.

31:16.141 --> 31:19.009
- Okay, go get your coat.

31:19.077 --> 31:20.544
No.

31:20.611 --> 31:23.579
- Let's go. Hey, you two,
come on. Let's go.

31:23.647 --> 31:25.347
- No!
- Don't leave me, please!

31:25.415 --> 31:29.184
[girls screaming]

31:29.252 --> 31:31.119
- Quiet down.
- Quiet down.

31:31.187 --> 31:33.287
- Jess, wait! No! Stop!

31:33.355 --> 31:35.322
- Let go! Let go!
[girls screaming]

31:35.390 --> 31:37.724
- Let me go!

31:52.247 --> 31:53.547
- You are crazy.

31:53.615 --> 31:56.250
First the drugs, now this.

31:56.318 --> 31:58.685
Do you realize the trouble
that you are in?

31:58.753 --> 31:59.919
- Galen, please.

31:59.987 --> 32:02.388
- No, this is over!

32:02.456 --> 32:05.525
I will not let you
do this.

32:05.593 --> 32:07.627
You will not ruin
the hopes and dreams

32:07.695 --> 32:10.597
That we have built for you.

32:10.665 --> 32:12.533
Our lawyer is on his way.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.033
We'll discuss some deal.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.301
Whatever you want.
- There's no deal, mr. Kerr,

32:16.369 --> 32:19.636
Until jessalyn tells us
everything she knows.

32:19.704 --> 32:22.872
- I don't have
to say anything.

32:22.939 --> 32:25.407
- We've got physical evidence,
paulette.

32:25.475 --> 32:26.642
- It doesn't matter.

32:26.709 --> 32:31.245
Only jessalyn and I
know the truth.

32:31.313 --> 32:34.349
And we'll never tell.

32:36.652 --> 32:38.453
I'm sharing that
with her right now.

32:40.856 --> 32:43.758
[door opens]

32:43.825 --> 32:45.993
- What?

32:46.061 --> 32:47.328
What did you do?

32:47.395 --> 32:50.264
- Get her out of here.

32:50.332 --> 32:51.800
- No. No, I came
to help you.

32:51.867 --> 32:55.104
- Get her out!
Get her out!

32:55.171 --> 32:58.872
Now! Go!

33:03.743 --> 33:04.843
- This whole thing
is my fault.

33:04.911 --> 33:08.413
I should have kept her away
from all this.

33:08.481 --> 33:13.751
This is not good for someone
as sensitive as paulette.

33:13.819 --> 33:16.654
- You were a dancer once too?

33:16.722 --> 33:18.956
- Yeah.

33:19.023 --> 33:20.557
But I couldn't afford
a sitter,

33:20.625 --> 33:23.360
So I would take her with me
to the theater,

33:23.427 --> 33:27.629
And she would watch
for hours.

33:27.697 --> 33:33.967
But can't pay the bills
as background, so I stopped.

33:34.035 --> 33:37.801
- You had a child to raise.

33:41.535 --> 33:43.802
- So what's gonna happen next?

33:43.870 --> 33:45.504
- We are gonna use
jessalyn kerr's testimony

33:45.571 --> 33:46.604
To build a case
against paulette.

33:46.672 --> 33:49.640
- That may be tough.
- Why?

33:49.708 --> 33:50.808
- At this point,
she's committed

33:50.876 --> 33:52.176
To being part
of the murder itself.

33:52.243 --> 33:53.710
- Yeah, but the evidence
will prove otherwise.

33:53.778 --> 33:55.312
- These girls don't care
about evidence...

33:55.379 --> 33:57.080
Or reality.

33:57.147 --> 33:59.615
What's going on between them
is all that really matters.

33:59.683 --> 34:00.916
- That's right.

34:00.984 --> 34:02.451
They've escaped into this
whole world of fantasy.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.552
- They're bonded
beyond all reason.

34:04.619 --> 34:05.652
- They're in love, you mean?

34:05.720 --> 34:07.287
They're in love,

34:07.355 --> 34:09.188
But I think it's more
than that.

34:09.257 --> 34:12.058
- Well, I don't know
what that is,

34:12.126 --> 34:15.228
But we hand over two defendants
where only one is guilty,

34:15.295 --> 34:16.795
And paulette's lawyer
is gonna use that

34:16.864 --> 34:18.797
To confuse the hell
out of the jury.

34:18.866 --> 34:20.833
It is a perfect setup
for endless mistrials.

34:20.900 --> 34:22.734
- Look, more than anything,
they want to be together.

34:22.802 --> 34:24.034
I think we should allow it,

34:24.103 --> 34:27.237
And then land on them
with reality.

34:27.306 --> 34:28.739
[knock on door]
- yeah. Come on.

34:28.806 --> 34:32.342
Good. Use that.

34:32.411 --> 34:33.844
- It's okay.
We're gonna go to paris.

34:33.911 --> 34:36.246
- [whispering]
ah, paris. This is just a test.

34:36.313 --> 34:37.481
- Yes.

34:37.549 --> 34:39.850
- Nothing is ever going
to tear us apart.

34:39.918 --> 34:43.887
We just have to
get through this.

34:47.358 --> 34:49.393
- I tell you, I've been going
through this book.

34:49.460 --> 34:52.897
Wow, it's really inspiring.

34:52.964 --> 34:56.766
It's obvious you got
a lot of talent.

34:56.833 --> 34:59.502
- We know.

34:59.570 --> 35:01.237
- Oh, I was talking
about paulette.

35:01.305 --> 35:04.106
I meant paulette.

35:08.411 --> 35:10.812
This is yours, isn't it?

35:10.880 --> 35:13.580
<i>- It's ours.</i>

35:13.648 --> 35:15.315
Jessalyn's a part
of everything I do.

35:15.382 --> 35:18.648
- Oh, yeah, I can see
you're very close.

35:21.150 --> 35:24.915
- We can communicate in ways
others can't understand.

35:24.983 --> 35:28.551
- Well, now,
what does that mean, exactly?

35:30.253 --> 35:32.687
- We can feel
each other's energy,

35:32.755 --> 35:37.024
And send thoughts
back and forth.

35:37.092 --> 35:38.359
- Oh, what is it,
like mind-reading?

35:38.427 --> 35:42.895
Sort of? Yes?
Really?

35:42.963 --> 35:45.096
Can you read my mind?

35:45.164 --> 35:47.731
- There has to be
an emotional bond.

35:51.201 --> 35:53.602
- Well, it's just so amazing
that you two have found it.

35:53.669 --> 35:57.672
- Nothing will ever
take it away.

36:00.042 --> 36:01.709
- But you need to guard
against jealousy.

36:01.777 --> 36:05.646
I meant your jealousy
of alona.

36:05.713 --> 36:07.814
What was it
she called her?

36:07.882 --> 36:09.450
It's in the journal there
somewhere.

36:09.517 --> 36:10.751
- "the dark queen."
here it is:

36:10.818 --> 36:13.488
"today is the day.
I've never felt more free.

36:13.556 --> 36:15.824
"because I now know
what I must do.

36:15.892 --> 36:20.964
The dark queen has struck
for the last time."

36:21.032 --> 36:23.100
That's the day
that alona was murdered.

36:23.167 --> 36:26.303
- And what happened,
paulette?

36:26.371 --> 36:30.007
The antifreeze didn't
make her sick enough?

36:30.075 --> 36:31.609
- Antifreeze?

36:31.676 --> 36:35.846
- Paulette was poisoning
the other dancers, jessalyn.

36:35.914 --> 36:40.451
Giving them just enough
to weaken their skills.

36:40.519 --> 36:45.122
- Everybody...But you.

36:47.692 --> 36:51.628
- So she did it for me,
and I love her.

36:51.696 --> 36:55.867
- Paulette doesn't feel
the same way.

37:00.608 --> 37:05.479
- This is so small...

37:19.795 --> 37:25.866
Yet it's so...
Powerful.

37:25.934 --> 37:29.170
- We found this
in your room, paulette.

37:29.237 --> 37:31.472
The imprints and blood samples
match the wound

37:31.539 --> 37:33.274
On alona's head.

37:33.342 --> 37:35.244
[loud bang]

37:35.312 --> 37:36.847
We know you had
a second bed check.

37:36.915 --> 37:38.952
You weren't there.

37:39.020 --> 37:42.525
- It's cruel, paulette,
letting jessalyn go down

37:42.592 --> 37:45.394
For something
that she didn't do.

37:48.596 --> 37:50.695
- This is not the first time
you've hurt her,

37:50.763 --> 37:52.563
Is it?

37:52.631 --> 37:55.064
- I love jessalyn.

37:55.132 --> 37:57.333
- Well, maybe you love
what she is.

37:57.400 --> 38:01.069
What you know
you can never be.

38:01.136 --> 38:03.903
- [sighs]
I don't understand.

38:03.971 --> 38:06.339
What are they talking about?

38:06.407 --> 38:08.475
- That day four months ago.

38:08.542 --> 38:09.542
You knew there was
something wrong

38:09.610 --> 38:10.643
As soon as you came down
on your toe.

38:10.711 --> 38:12.244
- When you found
that shard of glass,

38:12.312 --> 38:14.078
You must have been horrified.

38:14.146 --> 38:16.246
- That was alona!
She did that.

38:16.314 --> 38:17.814
- Well, look at here.
Oh, there it is.

38:17.882 --> 38:21.848
"alona wants to
take jessalyn down.

38:21.916 --> 38:23.048
"she's threatened by her.

38:23.116 --> 38:25.182
"I told alona
I'd do anything to help.

38:25.250 --> 38:29.150
"so I broke up a bottle,
and I took one of the pieces--"

38:29.218 --> 38:30.885
- No, no.
That's--that's wrong.

38:30.952 --> 38:33.686
That's a lie.

38:33.754 --> 38:36.054
They're trying to tear us apart.
Can you feel that?

38:36.121 --> 38:41.456
Just tell them that
it's not true.

38:41.524 --> 38:44.825
- You can never understand.

38:44.893 --> 38:48.860
- All right.

38:48.928 --> 38:52.029
Well, then, help us.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.698
Help us to understand,
paulette.

38:55.766 --> 38:59.734
- It feels so lonely
when you walk into a room

38:59.802 --> 39:02.537
And no one turns around.

39:02.604 --> 39:05.072
But with them--

39:05.140 --> 39:08.942
With them,
it's like the world shifts.

39:09.009 --> 39:11.110
I wanted to feel that,
just once.

39:11.178 --> 39:12.846
To know that I was
really special.

39:12.913 --> 39:15.751
- That's the only thing
you've ever wanted...

39:15.818 --> 39:16.819
Since you were
a little girl,

39:16.886 --> 39:18.654
And you saw your mother
up on the stage.

39:18.722 --> 39:21.593
- But your mother never
had the lead part,

39:21.661 --> 39:23.162
Did she?

39:23.230 --> 39:26.633
She never had that glory,
and that's what you want--

39:26.701 --> 39:29.068
To be, uh,
up in the front.

39:29.136 --> 39:32.071
- Your mother's dreams died.

39:32.138 --> 39:34.373
You wouldn't let
that happen to you.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.441
- So you attached yourself
to jessalyn,

39:36.509 --> 39:40.645
You attached yourself
to alona--the real stars.

39:40.713 --> 39:45.049
- She was ungrateful.

39:45.117 --> 39:47.251
- Alona?

39:47.319 --> 39:50.988
- I risked everything.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.389
I could have been expelled.

39:52.457 --> 39:54.158
And then she turned on me!

39:54.225 --> 39:56.260
- She humiliated you.

39:56.328 --> 39:59.129
- She told me
I went too far.

39:59.196 --> 40:02.263
She kept screaming,
"what kind of crazy freak

40:02.331 --> 40:03.930
Puts glass
in someone's shoes?"

40:03.998 --> 40:05.131
I'm not a freak.

40:05.199 --> 40:07.899
- And after that
she dumped you for ethan,

40:07.967 --> 40:09.734
And you moved on
to jessalyn.

40:11.169 --> 40:13.837
All this time--

40:13.905 --> 40:16.807
All this time,
you have been using me.

40:16.874 --> 40:19.875
- No, jessalyn, no.
I was finally happy.

40:19.943 --> 40:21.310
I didn't need
to be great anymore.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.311
I just wanted
to be with you.

40:23.378 --> 40:27.580
I couldn't let her hurt you...
Or us.

40:27.648 --> 40:32.350
- I thought I knew
everything about you.

40:32.418 --> 40:35.052
We were the same person.

40:35.120 --> 40:38.388
- No...
No, we still are.

40:38.456 --> 40:40.057
- No, not now.

40:40.124 --> 40:41.324
Not after everything
you've done.

40:41.392 --> 40:45.929
- No, no, no.

40:45.996 --> 40:48.097
[whispering]
I can feel you leaving me.

40:48.165 --> 40:52.868
- I'm sorry.
I have to.

40:52.936 --> 40:55.571
- [crying]
no.

40:55.638 --> 40:58.908
- I--I think--

40:58.975 --> 41:00.443
Can I go now?

41:04.448 --> 41:07.083
- Jessalyn?
Jessalyn!

41:11.354 --> 41:13.122
[shouting]
jessalyn!

41:29.673 --> 41:30.606
- We're gonna wait here
a minute.

41:30.674 --> 41:33.274
Someone's coming down
for you.

41:39.340 --> 41:40.736
- Please.

41:40.804 --> 41:43.337
- Okay, give them a minute.

41:56.820 --> 41:58.254
- [whispering]
I'm so sorry.

41:58.322 --> 42:01.758
[sobbing]
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

42:15.471 --> 42:17.105
- You all right?
