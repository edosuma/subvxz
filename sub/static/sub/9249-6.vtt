WEBVTT

00:05.652 --> 00:08.087
All right,
how does this sound?

00:08.087 --> 00:10.022
"At 11:13 a.m., Officer Biggs,

00:10.023 --> 00:13.025
"while purchasing a jumbo
chili dog with the works,

00:13.026 --> 00:15.761
noticed the suspect checking
for unlocked cars."

00:15.762 --> 00:17.463
It's a police report.

00:17.464 --> 00:19.999
You don't need to tell them
I was getting a chili dog.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.033
What? It's no secret...
look at your shirt.

00:22.936 --> 00:25.371
You're just jealous
I got the collar.

00:25.372 --> 00:26.705
Yeah, y-you got the collar,
y-your tie

00:26.706 --> 00:28.006
and the back of your pants.

00:29.376 --> 00:31.477
Seen triple homicides
with less splatter.

00:31.478 --> 00:35.514
Hey, if your jersey's not dirty,
you didn't play hard.

00:35.515 --> 00:37.083
You want some
more coffee?

00:37.084 --> 00:38.350
That's your third cup.

00:38.351 --> 00:40.085
It tastes good today
for some reason.

00:40.087 --> 00:42.154
Yeah? "Some reason" being
that cute rookie

00:42.155 --> 00:43.722
whose desk is
right by the break area?

00:43.723 --> 00:46.559
I'm a married man, I don't
notice that kind of stuff.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.426
Yeah? You didn't notice
those big beautiful brown eyes?

00:48.428 --> 00:50.896
They're blue.
No further questions, Your Honor.

00:50.897 --> 00:53.631
Got it, one sugar,
three thumbtacks.

00:56.503 --> 00:57.570
You're amazing.

00:57.571 --> 00:59.238
Excuse me?

00:59.239 --> 01:00.573
That's your third
cup of coffee,

01:00.574 --> 01:03.109
and you haven't gone
to the bathroom once.

01:03.110 --> 01:05.111
Eh, that comes from
being out on the beat.

01:05.111 --> 01:07.546
You stop to tinkle,
people could die.

01:07.547 --> 01:09.181
I have so much
to learn.

01:09.182 --> 01:10.416
(chuckles)

01:10.417 --> 01:12.885
Eh, you'll get there, it's
just mind over bladder.

01:12.886 --> 01:15.488
Oh, my God, is that blood
on your shirt?

01:15.489 --> 01:17.490
Well, until the boys
in the lab test it,

01:17.491 --> 01:18.791
we'll never
really know.

01:18.792 --> 01:20.759
But right now all the
evidence points to chili.

01:20.760 --> 01:21.927
Let me get
that for you.

01:21.928 --> 01:23.429
Oh, you don't
have to do that.

01:23.430 --> 01:25.431
I don't mind.

01:25.432 --> 01:27.399
You're a mess.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.868
What are we gonna
do with you?

01:28.869 --> 01:30.401
I don't...

01:32.606 --> 01:35.607
What the hell
did you do?

01:37.077 --> 01:39.078
Are you okay?

01:39.079 --> 01:42.515
Yeah, uh,
just can't sleep.

01:42.516 --> 01:45.350
I told you all that coffee was
gonna get you into trouble.

02:18.175 --> 02:19.509
Mmm, something
smells good.

02:19.510 --> 02:20.844
Bacon, but save your breath,

02:20.845 --> 02:23.478
he's not sharing.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.181
I am making a special
breakfast for Molly

02:25.182 --> 02:27.717
to show her that I care and
that I'm thinking about her,

02:27.718 --> 02:29.552
and her only, 24-7.

02:29.553 --> 02:32.555
Hey, I gave her life,
you give me bacon.

02:32.556 --> 02:34.390
Hey!

02:34.391 --> 02:37.259
That was a warning, the next one
comes with hot grease.

02:38.295 --> 02:39.429
Morning.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.363
Oh, there she is.

02:40.364 --> 02:41.965
My one and
only true love.

02:41.966 --> 02:43.099
Oh, wow.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.032
Wow.

02:44.034 --> 02:47.470
Get out of there,
you vultures!

02:47.471 --> 02:49.071
Hey, uh, I-I made you breakfast.

02:49.073 --> 02:52.809
I unloaded the dishwasher,
only broke three glasses.

02:52.810 --> 02:54.811
Glad you're wearing shoes.

02:54.812 --> 02:56.144
Thank you, sweetie,

02:56.146 --> 02:57.780
but I don't really
have time to eat.

02:57.781 --> 02:58.982
Well, everybody has time
for breakfast.

02:58.983 --> 03:00.650
It's the most important
meal of the day.

03:00.651 --> 03:01.918
That's why he has two.

03:01.919 --> 03:03.453
Ah!

03:03.454 --> 03:06.556
No, I'm writing at the library,
and if I don't get there early,

03:06.557 --> 03:08.658
then I have to go
in the kids' section,

03:08.659 --> 03:09.959
and Tuesday's story day,

03:09.960 --> 03:12.194
and I always get sucked
into those puppet shows.

03:12.196 --> 03:14.264
Well, can't you take
the day off?

03:14.265 --> 03:15.632
We can play hooky together.

03:15.633 --> 03:17.567
Pack a picnic, take a walk, huh?

03:17.568 --> 03:20.703
I might even be willing
to choke down a museum, huh?

03:20.704 --> 03:22.272
Aw, that's sweet, but I-I can't.

03:22.273 --> 03:24.574
I'm, like, this close
to finishing the book.

03:24.575 --> 03:25.608
That's great.

03:25.609 --> 03:26.876
No, I mean, I-I...

03:26.877 --> 03:30.013
I still have this much
of the book to write.

03:30.014 --> 03:33.016
Come on, I feel like
I haven't seen you in weeks.

03:33.017 --> 03:35.018
Well, this is
my job now.

03:35.019 --> 03:36.920
If you want to keep
frying up the bacon,

03:36.921 --> 03:39.121
Mama's got to keep
bringing it home.

03:40.257 --> 03:42.592
Aw, you tried.

03:42.593 --> 03:44.427
You're a terrific
husband.

03:44.428 --> 03:45.528
And handsome.

03:45.529 --> 03:46.996
And smart.

03:46.997 --> 03:49.197
Just eat the bacon.

04:08.886 --> 04:12.221
Carl, you want some coffee?

04:12.222 --> 04:13.990
Yeah, I could go for a cup.

04:13.991 --> 04:15.291
Good, uh, get me one, too.

04:15.292 --> 04:17.493
I like the French
vanilla creamer.

04:17.494 --> 04:19.062
I thought you were getting it.

04:19.063 --> 04:20.196
Well, since you're getting up.

04:20.197 --> 04:21.863
I'm not getting up.

04:22.967 --> 04:24.467
I thought you wanted
some coffee.

04:24.468 --> 04:25.768
When you were getting it.

04:25.769 --> 04:28.537
If I got to get it,
I don't want it.

04:35.079 --> 04:37.045
But I want some.

04:37.047 --> 04:40.315
Well, as long as you're going...
cream, two sugars.

04:41.785 --> 04:44.087
Fine, but the next time
you lose your gun,

04:44.088 --> 04:46.021
you're looking for it
on your own.

04:49.493 --> 04:52.161
(humming innocently)

04:52.162 --> 04:53.162
Hey.

04:53.163 --> 04:55.131
Hey!

04:55.132 --> 04:57.199
I was wondering when
you were gonna come visit me.

04:57.201 --> 05:00.670
Not visiting, just
getting coffee.

05:00.671 --> 05:04.172
Hang on, I have something
naughty to show you.

05:04.174 --> 05:06.442
I-I don't want
to see that.

05:06.443 --> 05:09.779
French vanilla
caramel creamer.

05:09.780 --> 05:12.448
It's kind of decadent, but
we can cheat a little, right?

05:12.449 --> 05:14.649
No. No, we can't.

05:15.452 --> 05:17.219
Come on,
I won't tell anybody.

05:17.221 --> 05:20.556
Well, that doesn't
make it right.

05:20.557 --> 05:22.358
Just take a sip.

05:22.359 --> 05:24.293
Listen,

05:24.294 --> 05:27.463
I'm sure that's wonderful,
but I have to pass.

05:27.464 --> 05:29.665
Okay, if I led you to believe
that I was interested

05:29.666 --> 05:31.968
in another creamer,
I apologize.

05:31.969 --> 05:34.270
Come on.

05:34.271 --> 05:36.272
Just take
a little sniff.

05:36.273 --> 05:37.440
(sniffs)

05:37.441 --> 05:38.807
Oh, God, that's good.

05:41.178 --> 05:42.478
We can't do this!

05:42.479 --> 05:44.179
I got to go!

05:51.488 --> 05:54.457
That's just ridiculous.

05:54.458 --> 05:57.126
Why would someone that beautiful
work in a dump like this?

05:57.127 --> 05:58.761
Did you see her back tattoo?

05:58.762 --> 06:01.797
Working here ain't
the first bad choice she's made.

06:01.799 --> 06:04.233
Yeah, you don't need
to read Chinese

06:04.234 --> 06:06.936
to know that tat says
"damaged goods""

06:06.937 --> 06:07.970
Do you mind?

06:07.971 --> 06:09.005
That's someone's daughter.

06:09.006 --> 06:10.473
The pierced tongue tells me

06:10.474 --> 06:14.276
Daddy hasn't been in the picture
for quite a while.

06:14.278 --> 06:17.814
Well, she could sit on my lap
and tell Papa Carl all about it.

06:17.815 --> 06:19.115
What are you doing?

06:19.116 --> 06:20.315
You got a girlfriend
at home.

06:20.317 --> 06:21.684
Yeah, and if
she was here,

06:21.685 --> 06:24.020
I wouldn't be saying
any of this stuff.

06:24.021 --> 06:25.921
I mean, that's why we
have guys' night, right?

06:25.923 --> 06:27.957
Yeah, we've been treating women
like people all week.

06:27.958 --> 06:30.425
Can't we have one day off?

06:30.427 --> 06:32.562
Don't you think
it's a little inappropriate

06:32.563 --> 06:35.130
to be leering at other women
while our wives are at home?

06:35.132 --> 06:36.799
Hey, just 'cause I'm in
a committed relationship

06:36.800 --> 06:39.334
doesn't mean I gave up
the right to be creepy.

06:41.004 --> 06:42.972
If anything, it gives us
the right to be creepier

06:42.973 --> 06:44.306
because we know
it's not going anywhere.

06:44.308 --> 06:46.975
Yeah, it's...
it's just fantasies.

06:46.977 --> 06:49.112
Well, I'm single...
I still have a shot.

06:49.113 --> 06:50.446
(scoffs)
See?

06:50.447 --> 06:51.814
Fantasies.

06:51.815 --> 06:53.081
(laughs)

06:53.083 --> 06:55.952
Can we talk about something
other than women, please?

06:55.953 --> 06:58.820
Sports, politics, religion...
anything at all.

07:04.495 --> 07:06.695
The weather. Anything.

07:06.697 --> 07:09.798
Well, the weather's been nasty
and needs to be spanked.

07:11.335 --> 07:13.569
You're a pig.
We're all pigs,

07:13.570 --> 07:16.505
and if I can't roll around
in my own filth, I'm leaving.

07:18.442 --> 07:21.344
Wait, you're going, too?
Oink, oink, my friend. You coming?

07:21.345 --> 07:22.812
No, Molly's working late.

07:22.813 --> 07:23.980
I'm gonna stick around
with Samuel.

07:23.981 --> 07:26.649
Mm, I'm leaving, too.

07:26.650 --> 07:28.351
I've seen enough.

07:28.352 --> 07:30.219
For what I need.

07:30.220 --> 07:32.388
Fine, beat it.

07:32.389 --> 07:33.922
I intend to.
Get out.

07:36.493 --> 07:38.094
Anything else I
can do for you?

07:38.095 --> 07:41.029
Yes, make good choices.

07:41.031 --> 07:43.365
Says the guy
drinking alone.

07:43.367 --> 07:45.433
Good point...
can I get another beer?

07:54.077 --> 07:56.278
If it isn't
Officer Creamer.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.081
Hey, wh-where did
you come from?

07:59.082 --> 08:00.582
Oh, Oklahoma.

08:01.485 --> 08:03.886
No, I mean
here, tonight.

08:03.887 --> 08:05.021
Oh, the station.

08:05.022 --> 08:07.023
They said this was
a good place to grab a drink.

08:07.024 --> 08:08.491
It is, it is, uh...

08:08.492 --> 08:10.860
I was just on my
way out, so, uh...

08:10.861 --> 08:12.727
Okay.

08:14.326 --> 08:15.464
What the hell?

08:15.465 --> 08:16.899
I can sit
for one beer.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.201
Great.

08:18.202 --> 08:19.936
Will you bring us
a pitcher?

08:19.937 --> 08:23.138
Don't worry, I know where
all the checkpoints are.

08:28.612 --> 08:30.613
Oh, I always wanted
to be a cop.

08:30.614 --> 08:32.515
In grade school
I was a hall monitor.

08:32.515 --> 08:35.484
The badge, the fear
in a third grader's eyes

08:35.485 --> 08:36.818
when they didn't have
a hall pass.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.486
(chuckles)

08:38.488 --> 08:41.022
God, I loved
the power.

08:41.024 --> 08:44.327
Well, my dad was a
cop, so I'm a cop.

08:44.328 --> 08:45.961
That's the only
reason?

08:45.963 --> 08:47.430
Well, that and
the uniform.

08:47.431 --> 08:50.066
I don't like thinking about
what I have to wear every day.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.133
Mailman never
crossed your mind?

08:52.135 --> 08:53.769
I like the
shorts idea,

08:53.770 --> 08:56.906
my head's too big
for a safari hat.

08:56.907 --> 08:59.140
I'll be right back,
I'm gonna run to the restroom.

08:59.142 --> 09:00.376
Hang on, you
got a pass?

09:00.377 --> 09:02.544
As a matter of fact, I do.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.587
Make good choices.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.400
Mmm, something smells good.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.534
It's not for you,
it's for Mike.

09:30.536 --> 09:33.103
What is it with you two
and bogarting the bacon?

09:34.440 --> 09:35.840
He was out really late
last night,

09:35.841 --> 09:38.009
and I have a feeling he's
gonna need a hangover helper.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.344
Morning!

09:39.345 --> 09:40.545
See you tonight.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.080
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.181
Come on, party man,
sit down.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.117
You know, I should
really get going.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.752
Well, it's 8:30 in the morning.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.953
What's so important at work?

09:48.954 --> 09:51.623
Nothing,
there's nothing at work.

09:51.624 --> 09:54.692
Well, then you have time
for a nice breakfast.

09:54.693 --> 09:57.060
Why are you so good to me?

09:57.062 --> 09:59.230
You made me that great
breakfast yesterday,

09:59.231 --> 10:00.864
and I just ran out.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.867
Well, hey, I mean,
you got things to do.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.169
You're an important writer lady.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.537
I'm just a stupid, stupid cop!

10:08.774 --> 10:10.475
All right, calm down.
They're just eggs.

10:10.476 --> 10:11.643
I don't deserve eggs.

10:11.644 --> 10:12.844
I don't deserve anything.

10:12.845 --> 10:14.546
Mike!

10:14.547 --> 10:15.814
What...

10:15.815 --> 10:17.982
What's with him?

10:17.983 --> 10:20.217
Maybe he's still drunk.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.221
Lucky son of a bitch.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.431
Want to stop by
Abe's for breakfast?

10:34.433 --> 10:35.500
Not hungry.

10:35.501 --> 10:36.634
Oh, you eat at home?

10:36.635 --> 10:38.503
No, I'm just not hungry.

10:38.504 --> 10:39.838
I don't mean to alarm you,

10:39.839 --> 10:41.072
but the last time you
skipped breakfast,

10:41.073 --> 10:43.174
you were six days into
that obstructed bowel.

10:43.175 --> 10:44.776
Just drop it.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.411
I'm trying
to process something, okay?

10:46.412 --> 10:48.379
Can I do it
in silence, please?

10:48.380 --> 10:50.581
Of course.

10:52.384 --> 10:54.985
Is it about us?
No.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.188
I wish I could believe you.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.391
All right, I'll tell you,

11:00.392 --> 11:01.825
but you can't say anything.

11:01.827 --> 11:02.894
Of course.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.862
You know that new rookie, Stacey?
Yeah.

11:04.864 --> 11:07.364
She kissed me.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.301
What, on purpose?

11:11.303 --> 11:14.005
Yeah, after you left
the bar last night, she came in.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.673
We had a couple of drinks,
and she planted one on me.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.910
Was it a friendly
kiss or a sexy kiss?

11:18.911 --> 11:20.445
Show me on my hand.

11:20.446 --> 11:22.013
Get out!

11:22.014 --> 11:23.147
Well, then what'd you do?

11:23.148 --> 11:24.349
I ran my ass out of there.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.682
All right, then you
did nothing wrong.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.317
Well, then why do I feel
like crap?

11:27.319 --> 11:28.820
Maybe because you been flirting
with her all week,

11:28.821 --> 11:30.188
you didn't leave the bar
when you should have,

11:30.189 --> 11:32.422
and you ended the night
smooching up on some strange.

11:32.424 --> 11:35.158
Oh, God, how am I gonna
tell Molly about this?

11:35.160 --> 11:37.195
You don't.
You don't say a word.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.630
You keep those
kissable lips shut.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.764
But... I just...
Shut. Shut it.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.132
Not a peep.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.436
I got to say, it's kind of nice,

11:45.437 --> 11:46.771
you being the one
that's in trouble

11:46.772 --> 11:48.605
and me sitting on the high horse
for a change.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.076
Ride 'em, Carl boy.

11:52.077 --> 11:54.278
(clicking tongue)

11:59.752 --> 12:01.286
Meet me at the coffee pot.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.587
Okay.

12:02.588 --> 12:04.355
Bring your cup;
this has to look natural.

12:04.356 --> 12:06.523
Sorry.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.629
Look, we need to get something
very, very clear, okay?

12:11.630 --> 12:14.631
Those do not touch these
ever again.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.668
I know, I know.
I have absolutely no idea

12:16.669 --> 12:17.701
why I did that.

12:17.703 --> 12:20.404
Well, it's not
a complete mystery.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.875
Look, I just got out
of a horrible relationship,

12:23.876 --> 12:25.309
and you were so nice to me.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.810
Drink.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.782
Mmm, coffee.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.083
Yum.

12:37.222 --> 12:40.757
Look, we are coworkers
and nothing else, okay?

12:40.759 --> 12:43.328
I am a happily married man,
and I love my wife

12:43.329 --> 12:45.062
more than anything in the world.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.698
Understood.
Great.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.600
Can I say one thing?
What is it?

12:48.601 --> 12:52.236
The fact that you're so loyal
is a really big turn-on for me.

12:52.237 --> 12:53.605
Hey.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.839
You need to control yourself,

12:54.840 --> 12:57.040
'cause this prime rib
is off the market.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.316
(groaning)

13:05.317 --> 13:07.685
I don't want to.

13:07.686 --> 13:09.487
<i>Out.</i>

13:09.488 --> 13:11.589
Out, damn spot.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.357
Molly, can you help me
with this?

13:13.359 --> 13:16.126
Sorry, old bean,
busy with the book.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.062
(bell dinging)

13:18.063 --> 13:19.364
I can help you with that.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.332
No! No, go away!

13:21.333 --> 13:23.935
Michael, is there something
I should know?

13:23.936 --> 13:25.670
No, nothing.

13:25.671 --> 13:28.539
Your tie is growing;
I know you're lying.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.241
(typing)

13:30.242 --> 13:32.843
Show her on my hand, man.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.478
Carl, get out of here!

13:34.480 --> 13:35.613
You should have beat it
when I did.

13:35.614 --> 13:37.048
I know.
Remember,

13:37.049 --> 13:39.883
it doesn't mean anything
if they kiss you.

13:39.885 --> 13:41.485
(dinging continues)

13:41.487 --> 13:43.721
No!

13:43.722 --> 13:45.723
(gasps)

13:45.724 --> 13:47.758
(groans)

13:47.760 --> 13:49.961
Molly, I love you,
I love you so much.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.829
I love you, too, sweetie.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.364
And the last thing
in the world

13:53.365 --> 13:55.767
I would ever want to do
is hurt you.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.034
Okay.

13:57.036 --> 14:00.103
And if I could undo what I did,
I would.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.907
What the hell did you do?

14:05.844 --> 14:07.245
Technically, nothing.

14:07.246 --> 14:08.680
It was, it was done to me,

14:08.681 --> 14:10.615
but I should've never been there
to let it happen.

14:10.616 --> 14:13.750
Okay, what's the "i""
that we're talking about?

14:13.752 --> 14:16.420
A kiss by a girl.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.221
Wait, you kissed someone?

14:18.223 --> 14:19.890
No, no, no, she kissed me.
Who kissed you?

14:19.892 --> 14:21.258
A girl at work.
Where?

14:21.260 --> 14:25.029
At the bar.
No, on your body!

14:25.030 --> 14:27.431
Well, on the lips.
Where else would she kiss me?

14:27.433 --> 14:28.700
I don't know!

14:28.701 --> 14:30.568
I don't even know what's
going on right now.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.135
Okay, the new rookie

14:32.137 --> 14:33.871
from work came out to the bar
last night,

14:33.872 --> 14:35.672
and we were just talking
about police stuff.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.642
Next thing I knew, she gets up
to go to the bathroom,

14:37.643 --> 14:39.076
and she plants one on me.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.377
Did you kiss her back?

14:40.379 --> 14:41.512
No! I don't know!

14:41.513 --> 14:43.481
It happened so fast.
I was so stupid.

14:43.482 --> 14:44.981
I should've left
when the guys did.

14:44.983 --> 14:46.483
Yeah, well, why didn't you?

14:46.485 --> 14:48.586
Well, because you weren't home
and I didn't want to be alone.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.421
Oh, so this is my fault?

14:50.422 --> 14:51.756
No, no, no, no.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.391
No, no, no, no, this is on me.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.226
It doesn't matter
that you haven't been around.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.829
I haven't been around 'cause
I'm trying to finish a book

14:57.830 --> 14:59.096
which is for us.

14:59.098 --> 15:01.398
I know,
I've just missed you lately.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.967
Well, I missed you, too.
You don't see me

15:02.968 --> 15:04.769
running around,
kissing other people.

15:04.770 --> 15:06.336
Look,

15:06.338 --> 15:09.340
from the bottom of my heart,
I am sorry.

15:09.341 --> 15:12.309
I will never let anything
like this happen ever again.

15:12.311 --> 15:15.012
You are the most important thing
in my life.

15:15.013 --> 15:17.681
I don't want to lose you.

15:17.683 --> 15:21.384
Oh, for God's sakes, you're
not gonna lose me, dummy.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.424
I am not happy...

15:26.425 --> 15:28.625
about this.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.498
I know.

15:33.499 --> 15:36.833
You need to keep those
stupid lips in your pants.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.171
I will, I promise.

15:40.172 --> 15:42.372
(sighs)

15:43.275 --> 15:46.477
And the next time
that you are...

15:46.478 --> 15:48.780
feeling a little lonely or...

15:48.781 --> 15:51.682
you know, underappreciated,

15:51.683 --> 15:53.818
will you just come
and talk to me

15:53.819 --> 15:57.522
and not put yourself
in an awkward situation?

15:57.523 --> 15:59.723
I won't.

16:01.226 --> 16:03.728
Thanks for being
so understanding.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.097
Well, it happens.

16:06.098 --> 16:08.866
I learned that lesson
at my writer's workshop.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.903
I mean, you may be just
looking for a shoulder rub,

16:11.904 --> 16:14.070
but there's always someone

16:14.072 --> 16:17.240
that's looking to
rub something else.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.679
Wait, what?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.014
I told you about that.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.149
No, you didn't.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.617
I didn't?

16:26.618 --> 16:28.252
Huh.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.287
Well, I forgive you.

16:41.308 --> 16:42.822
Thanks for the advice, Carl,

16:42.823 --> 16:45.290
because I did
the exact opposite.

16:45.292 --> 16:48.093
I told Molly what happened,
and now everything's fine.

16:48.095 --> 16:49.395
I always knew
you were gonna tell her.

16:49.396 --> 16:51.564
You just needed a little push
in the wrong direction.

16:51.565 --> 16:52.898
Where is she?

16:52.899 --> 16:54.734
Are you her, huh?

16:54.735 --> 16:55.868
Hey, no, Mol.
Are you her?

16:55.869 --> 16:57.236
Mol, no.
No?

16:57.237 --> 16:59.605
Ah, how about you? Oh-ho-ho.

16:59.606 --> 17:01.207
How about you?

17:01.208 --> 17:02.975
Hey! Hey.

17:02.976 --> 17:04.210
Hey.

17:04.211 --> 17:05.743
Over by the coffee.

17:05.746 --> 17:09.881
Good, because that would be
a tall tree to take down.

17:13.185 --> 17:14.686
Hey.

17:14.688 --> 17:16.622
I'm just here visiting my man.

17:16.623 --> 17:19.625
Did you hear that,
"my man"?

17:19.626 --> 17:20.893
We haven't met.

17:20.894 --> 17:22.027
I'm-I'm Stacey.

17:22.028 --> 17:23.595
I know who you are.

17:25.732 --> 17:28.467
And I know what you are,
and I want you to keep your lips

17:28.468 --> 17:32.303
and your whore creamer
away from my husband.

17:34.474 --> 17:36.442
Yeah.

17:36.443 --> 17:40.111
That's what I thought.

17:46.353 --> 17:48.154
See you at home!

17:48.155 --> 17:49.687
(whispering):
I'm watching you.

17:51.291 --> 17:53.057
God, I love that woman.
