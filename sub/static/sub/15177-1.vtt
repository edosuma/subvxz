Aw, no fuckin' cheese.

-Man: Yeah.

(panting)

04:21.329 --> 04:23.731
-Okay. Here we go.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.533
One, two, three.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.570
(laughing)

04:29.670 --> 04:30.871
-Wait.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.840
(laughing)
Oh. No, no, no.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.342
(laughing)

04:34.408 --> 04:36.577
Very good.
Good job there.

-Ooh, look at that.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.057
-(laughing)
-Whoa.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.426
What do you call it
when people burn up like that?

04:53.861 --> 04:55.496
-No working during lunch.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.031
-You liar.
That's not what
you call it.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.004
-Oh, you--
-(laughing)

05:04.104 --> 05:05.839
-Very funny!
Give me that.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.710
-Oh, I dropped it.
-Stop.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.695
-Well, the Paradise
definitely makes our list

05:27.795 --> 05:29.697
for Best of
the and Sleazy in LA.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.133
-Hey, I knew
you'd make us late.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.868
-That's research.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.570
-Well, that's great
for you old-timers,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.005
but I'm new.

05:39.473 --> 05:42.610
-Hey, we're partners.
We look out for each other.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.481
-So what about tonight?

05:48.416 --> 05:50.050
-What happened
to that, uh,

05:50.150 --> 05:52.620
no strings attached,
let's have fun?

05:53.921 --> 05:56.490
What? You'd really like
to meet my parents tonight?

05:56.590 --> 05:58.426
-Yes.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.028
-Okay.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.931
-Okay.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.833
Listen, I was thinking
maybe I could do a story

06:05.933 --> 06:07.735
on that woman who burned.
-Let's go.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.138
-(cars honking)

06:19.012 --> 06:20.948
-Listen, I really
want to do a story

06:21.048 --> 06:23.451
on that woman who burned.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.519
-I don't think
it's right for the Eye.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.021
-I'm sick of being
at the calendar.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.523
I want to be a reporter.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.792
You could get Eli
to give me a chance.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.296
-(quietly) Not really
the kind of story we do here.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.566
-Hank, he'll listen to you!

06:41.001 --> 06:42.503
-(whispers)
Okay.

06:48.976 --> 06:52.079
-Male Reporter:
Police continue to investigate
the bizarre suicide

06:52.179 --> 06:55.749
that occurred earlier...
-Boy, she was a pretty
hot one, huh?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.050
-Where you been?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.919
-Tried a new restaurant.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.788
-Yeah, what was the special?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.523
Chicken Ã  la Kim?

07:02.623 --> 07:04.758
-(laughing)
-Aw, come on, man.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.861
-(indistinct conversation)

07:09.763 --> 07:11.665
-He's back.
-Hey.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.502
-Huh?

07:14.535 --> 07:16.336
-Male Reporter:
Our captivating top story:

07:16.504 --> 07:18.138
police are still investigating

07:18.238 --> 07:20.608
the strange and bizarre
incident that occurred...
-Eli: Weird.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.009
-Hank: No ID.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.812
They said they
know nothing about her.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.413
-Hi, Eli.
-Hi.

07:26.514 --> 07:29.149
-This would make
a great story.
-Spontaneous combustion.

07:29.249 --> 07:32.152
-Yeah, this sort of thing's
been documented.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.656
It's kind of bizarre,
some good material there.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.891
-You know, maybe we
should do something on this.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.694
-I was thinking maybe I--
-Hank, why don't you jump on it?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.563
-It could be a lead-off
on a cover piece.

07:42.663 --> 07:46.567
You know, like, "Incredible,
Unexplained Mysteries,"
you know, uh...

07:46.667 --> 07:49.570
spontaneous combustion.
-The Devil's Triangle.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.539
-How about those
little pyramids that
sharpen razor blades?

07:51.639 --> 07:53.541
-Just stop.
-Why do you hate me?

07:53.607 --> 07:56.076
-Hey, a woman just
died here!

07:56.176 --> 07:58.378
This is bullshit!

07:58.546 --> 08:01.549
-I get--
I get images of flames.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.051
-You give something a name
and that explains it?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.786
A woman died here!

08:05.886 --> 08:09.256
Spontaneous combustion,
that means nothing!

08:11.191 --> 08:13.561
-Oh, Kim, uh, classifieds.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.163
Um, have you
gotten them posted today?

08:17.565 --> 08:18.932
-Yes.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.634
-Good, good, good job.
Come on in, guys.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.571
-Listen, I've been working
real hard around here--

08:23.637 --> 08:27.675
-I haven't seen
anybody work harder
their first month.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.778
-Eli, maybe...

08:30.878 --> 08:32.279
-Oh, um...

08:32.379 --> 08:34.881
Could you make
some fresh coffee, please?

08:34.982 --> 08:36.884
Thanks.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.291
-Boys will be boys.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.930
Have a little patience.
-Yeah.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.800
The only way to get
anything around here is
if you have a dick.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.836
-So how are things
going with Hank, anyway?

08:56.937 --> 08:58.071
-I don't know.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.674
-I'm supposed to have dinner
with his folks tonight.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.044
-So are you gonna go?

09:06.614 --> 09:08.816
-Damn it, Janice!
Why do we need men anyway?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.925
Newitt Street?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.843
I'm gonna do it anyway.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.645
-Huh?

10:04.171 --> 10:06.874
-(distant chattering)

10:14.047 --> 10:15.382

10:22.756 --> 10:25.793
-Did you see it?
-Does not work.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.128
-Did you see what
happened last night,

10:28.228 --> 10:29.697
the girl jumped,
did you see that?

10:29.797 --> 10:32.666
-Can not help but see it,
live upstairs.

10:32.766 --> 10:37.070
Too much noise:
siren, police, reporter.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.673
-Who was she?

10:39.773 --> 10:42.175
-She not from
around here.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.077
(shouts)

10:49.783 --> 10:52.686
She burned,
scorched real good.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.655
Nothing left,
waist down.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.029
-How did she
get up to the roof?

11:02.129 --> 11:05.232
-Through building,
from any apartment in building.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.901
What you think
she do up there?

11:08.001 --> 11:10.170
Could be hooker, huh?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.048
-(bell rings)

12:14.567 --> 12:16.804
-Thank you
and Merry Christmas.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.379
-(gasps)
-(books clatter)

12:26.479 --> 12:28.015
-Excuse me.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.488
(gasps)

13:18.465 --> 13:21.869
-Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

13:24.404 --> 13:26.306
-No, Ricky.
Now you go back up.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.344
-Hey, I'm really sorry.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.146
-He really ought
to be institutionalized.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.781
Can I help you?

13:34.882 --> 13:37.284
-I'm looking for
a book on...

13:38.451 --> 13:40.087
spontaneous combustion.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.456
-You were in
the right place.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.259
"Unexplained
Natural Phenomena."

13:50.097 --> 13:50.931
-Thank you.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.265
-This wouldn't have
anything to do

13:52.365 --> 13:54.134
with the woman
who died last night?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.304
-(sighs)
I'm sorry. I'm Kim Levitt.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.907
I'm not undercover
or anything.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.909
Um, I work for the LA Eye.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.977
I'm an investigative reporter.

14:04.077 --> 14:08.048
I'm doing a story
on the suicide.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.118
-Yes, the natural
combustion.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.087
I'm Fima.
I own this place.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.793
-Oh, is it true that
I can get to the roof

14:20.928 --> 14:22.395
from any of
the upstairs apartments.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.931
-Yes.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.466
There's an access
at the end of the hallway.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.800
I live upstairs.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.937
Oh, would you like some?

14:30.003 --> 14:33.006
-Yes, thank you.
I haven't had any lunch.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.551
Did you know her?

14:44.651 --> 14:47.387
-No.
-(cash register beeps)

14:47.487 --> 14:49.456
-Did you ever
see her before?

14:49.556 --> 14:53.093
-No. $9.56.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.965
Oh, let me.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.339
-The guy down the street
thinks maybe she was a hooker.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.242
-The butcher?
-Mm-hmm.

15:11.144 --> 15:14.114
-He thinks all women
are whores.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.984
-There's got to be
some logical explanation
for the burning.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.319
-No, there is no
logical explanation.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.889
-Oh, not this one, thank you.

15:22.990 --> 15:26.259
-Oh, read this.
I think you'll find
this really useful.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.362
-I don't think
there's anything in here on
spontaneous combustion, though.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.198
-I didn't charge you for it.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.000
It's a gift.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.267
-I can't.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.669
Thank you.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.139
-Why don't you
come to our picnic tomorrow?

15:40.073 --> 15:42.009
I'll write down
the address?

15:51.351 --> 15:53.453
And this will be
your invitation.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.189
-Thank you.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.029
-I hope you'll come.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.400
-Could you show me
up to the roof, please?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.735
-Oh, sure.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.104
Katherine, will you
cover for me please?

16:11.204 --> 16:13.240
Come with me.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.060
That's the roof access.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.528
I don't think you'll
find any clues left.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.297
The police
were very thorough.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.066
-Thanks.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.438
-(door closes)

16:45.538 --> 16:47.307

Ugh.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.142
-(phone ringing)

20:10.243 --> 20:11.878
-Voicemail:
Hello, this is Kim.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.146
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.316
-Hey, Kim. Hank.
Where are you?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.251
My mom cooked
this whole dinner.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.852
I can't believe
you haven't called.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.721
Please call me
when you get this message.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.222
-Ooh.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.689
(gasps)

20:56.789 --> 20:58.591
(grunts)

21:04.397 --> 21:07.400
-Damn it.
-(phone ringing)

21:07.500 --> 21:10.236
-What?
-Hank: What are you doing?
Are you coming or what?

21:10.337 --> 21:13.640
-Yes, I'm coming.
I'm changing.
Five minutes.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.383
-Why don't you
try one of these?

21:23.483 --> 21:25.418
I think you will
really like them?

21:26.085 --> 21:27.520
-Oh, thank you.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.656
-(Christmas music playing)

21:34.361 --> 21:36.563
-Their from an
old family recipe.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.701
-Delicious.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.438
-Hank:
I'd like to propose
a toast.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.740
Merry Christmas to everybody,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.676
and welcome, Kim.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.478
-Merry Christmas.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.713
-Hank's mother:
Welcome, Kim.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.715
Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

22:02.989 --> 22:06.393
-(burps)
Honey.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.602
(sighs)
Do you know where
all that beer goes?

22:16.869 --> 22:18.405
-Excuse me?

22:18.438 --> 22:20.873
-Neither do I.
(laughing)

22:20.973 --> 22:25.545
(laughing)

22:25.645 --> 22:27.279
-What can I say?

22:27.414 --> 22:29.482
-(Hank's father laughs)

22:30.149 --> 22:31.451
-That's a new one, Dad.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.820
-Yeah, well, I told that
to you last year.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.522
It always works.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.761
-What's in there?
-Ask him.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.433
-So you excited?

22:46.499 --> 22:47.600
-Yeah.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.769
Do you have
your tree up yet.
It's almost Christmas.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.303
-Not yet.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.005
-Lonnie, Kim's Jewish.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.508
-Oh, Jesus.

22:55.608 --> 22:58.511
-What is it, dear?

22:58.611 --> 23:00.312
-So you don't
have the tree or Christmas.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.582
-She celebrates Chanukah.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.485
-Actually,
I'm not religious.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.687
It's the time
of year, really.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.088
See, all kinds of cultures

23:09.188 --> 23:11.458
have always celebrated
something at this time

23:11.491 --> 23:14.093
and Chanukah and Christmas
are just different holidays

23:14.193 --> 23:15.895
that deal with it
in different ways.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.697
-Bullshit.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.569
-Gus.
-No, bullshit.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.136
-Dad.

23:27.740 --> 23:31.944
-So, uh, you work
on the newspaper with Hank?

23:32.044 --> 23:34.481
-Well, we don't exactly
work together.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.182
-Kim works on the calendar,

23:36.282 --> 23:38.618
and she also
does the classifieds for us.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.252
-Right.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.489
-Sounds interesting.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.824
-Well, I think a woman's
place is in the home,

23:44.924 --> 23:46.693
raising a family.

23:48.495 --> 23:49.762
-These are really good.

23:49.862 --> 23:54.200
-You know,
woman was made from
the rib of man.

23:54.300 --> 23:57.303
I, uh, I think that's
in your bible too.

23:57.504 --> 24:00.006
-Dad, that's a myth.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.510
It's an allegory.
It's all relative.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.912
-You know, that's the trouble
with you kids today.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.515
You think everything
is relative.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.583
Well, let me tell
you something, pal.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.353
It is God-damned real

24:14.521 --> 24:16.623
and you had better
believe that.

24:21.728 --> 24:25.064
-Kim, don't take it
so seriously.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.733
-Hey, it doesn't matter.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.669
-You're right.
It doesn't matter.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.671
They're from
a different world from us.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.641
-You know, I think
you're from a different
world from us.

24:34.741 --> 24:37.610
I still can't believe
you took that story from Eli

24:37.710 --> 24:39.178
and you didn't
even want it.

24:39.278 --> 24:41.814
You didn't even
want to do it.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.584
And then you just
ignored what we were
talking about.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.555
-Kim, he's the boss.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.759
-You didn't even
stand up for me.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.596
-Kim.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.805
Come on,
let's go back
to my place.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.454
-Get off of me!
What is wrong with you?

25:22.589 --> 25:25.424
Why are you always
jumping on top of me?

25:25.592 --> 25:27.026
You're like
a dog in heat.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.896
-What's the matter with you?

25:29.996 --> 25:32.599
-I'm just as good
as you, you know,

25:32.665 --> 25:35.835
you and Eli and Jeff,
and I'm sick of it.

25:35.935 --> 25:39.706
I'm gonna do what I want
whether you like it or not.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.208
And I'm gonna do
the story I want to do.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.913
-You know,
with an attitude like that,
you're gonna lose your job.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.248
-Oh, yeah,
well, fuck my attitude,

25:49.348 --> 25:51.618
and fuck the job,
and fuck you!

25:51.651 --> 25:53.085
-(door slams)
-(engine starts)

25:53.185 --> 25:55.454
-Kim.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.624
Kim!
-(tires screech)

27:07.159 --> 27:09.829
-(chirping)
-(gasps)

27:41.928 --> 27:44.731
-(chirping)

27:51.871 --> 27:54.741
(squelching)

27:57.944 --> 27:59.245
-(whimpering)

27:59.345 --> 28:01.914
(groans and gasps)

28:02.014 --> 28:04.984
(gasping)

28:09.321 --> 28:11.390
(moaning)

28:15.127 --> 28:17.797
(gagging)

28:18.965 --> 28:21.100
(coughing)

28:23.936 --> 28:25.772
(vomits)

28:34.246 --> 28:36.115
(coughs)

28:57.169 --> 28:58.805
-(knocking)
-Janice: Kim?

28:58.871 --> 29:01.207
-(knocking)
-Kim, are you all right?

29:01.307 --> 29:03.509
-(knocking)
-(phone beeping)

29:06.045 --> 29:08.080
-(coughs)
-(knocking)

29:09.015 --> 29:11.818
-Janice:
Kim, open up!
It's me!

29:12.384 --> 29:13.452
-Janice?

29:13.552 --> 29:16.055
-Kim, it's me, Janice.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.633
-What's the matter?

29:27.867 --> 29:29.135
-(sighs)

29:29.235 --> 29:30.970
-What happened?
Are you all right?

29:33.139 --> 29:35.674
I'm worried about you.
I tried your phone,
but it was out.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.844
-(beeping continues)

29:45.217 --> 29:47.186
(beeping stops)

30:05.972 --> 30:07.506
-What's been
going on here?

30:07.606 --> 30:10.076
-It must have
been something I ate.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.013
-Have you seen a doctor?

30:14.113 --> 30:16.883
-It's nothing like that.
I don't need a doctor.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.085
Thank you.

30:19.185 --> 30:21.921
-Do you want a ride to work?

30:24.390 --> 30:25.858
-I don't think so.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.093
Um...

30:27.193 --> 30:28.394
I'll be in a little later.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.229
I'm working on
something right now.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.998
-Oh, boy.

30:34.366 --> 30:35.767
Eli was pissed as hell

30:35.868 --> 30:37.469
when you didn't show up
for work yesterday afternoon.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.305
-(chuckles)

30:39.405 --> 30:41.340
Boys will be boys.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.088
-Welcome to our party.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.961
It's the solstice.
-It's so pretty here.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.363
Here, I brought
this for you.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.198
-Oh, thank you.
Perfect.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.100
Come on.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.505
Look what Kim brought?
-Ah.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.474
-Katherine,
did you meet Kim?
-No.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.609
-Kim, this is
Katherine Harrison.

31:50.709 --> 31:53.179
She's our wise mother.

31:53.279 --> 31:54.981
-Old crone, really.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.615
I think I saw you
at the store.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.017
So happy to meet you.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.551
-It's nice to
meet you too, Katherine.

31:59.651 --> 32:03.589
-This is Jane E. Na.
Jane teaches dance
at the music center.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.992
-I'm glad you could join us.
-Thank you.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.659
-I'm so glad
you could make it.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.128
I thought you
might have to work.

32:09.228 --> 32:12.064
-Well, in a way,
this could be construed as work.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.733
-Katherine:
You're a reporter?

32:15.001 --> 32:16.802
-Yeah.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.337
Kind of.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.838
You know,
I'm really interested

32:20.006 --> 32:21.373
in the suicide
at your building.

32:21.473 --> 32:24.110
I don't know
what it is about that
woman burning,

32:24.210 --> 32:27.246
but when I first saw that,
I could almost feel it.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.150
-I never heard a thing.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.420
-You were there?

32:34.520 --> 32:37.256
-Yes, I spent
the night at Fima's.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.561
-What do you think
could have possibly
caused something like that?

32:42.661 --> 32:45.164
-She wasn't strong enough.

32:48.034 --> 32:52.038
-You knew her?
-No. No, we didn't.

32:53.039 --> 32:55.307
You like the wine?
-Yes, thank you.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.647
(giggles)
You know, Fima,

33:01.747 --> 33:03.049
that book you gave me,

33:03.149 --> 33:04.716
there's a picture
of a woman

33:04.816 --> 33:07.153
with nothing but
fire from the waist down.

33:07.253 --> 33:10.056
-Lilith, she was
Adam's first wife.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.591
She was made
from the same dirt,

33:12.691 --> 33:14.193
but she wouldn't
let him lay on top of her.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.895
-Lilith?
-She left Adam

33:17.063 --> 33:19.765
and consorted with
Power of Night.

33:19.865 --> 33:22.401
-She was the serpent
that tempted Eve.

33:22.501 --> 33:25.137
-Spirit of all that crawls.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.506
-(gasps)

33:30.509 --> 33:34.080
It's my job.
I think it's driving
me crazy, literally.

33:36.082 --> 33:38.417
You know, I'll probably
lose my job because of this.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.086
-Katherine:
What do you mean?

33:40.186 --> 33:41.987
-Well, Eli didn't
give me this story.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.655
I'm just doing it myself.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.225
-Katherine: Good for you.

33:46.325 --> 33:47.726
-You know what?
I don't really think I care

33:47.826 --> 33:49.428
if I do lose my job.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.498
I'm ready for a change.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.233
-To Kim.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.602
-At solstice.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.737
-The turning point.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.173
-The turning point.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.880
-Do you want
to go for a walk?

34:09.114 --> 34:10.149
-Sure.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.984
Do you want to come, Kim?
-No thanks.

34:13.119 --> 34:15.221
I think I've had
too much to drink.

34:15.321 --> 34:16.422
-Okay.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.504
-I'm glad you came.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.079
-Hank: Kim!

35:14.180 --> 35:15.814
What the hell
are you doing?

35:16.815 --> 35:19.751
Come on, let's go.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.221
Eli's having
a shit-fit.

35:35.967 --> 35:39.238
Eli, she was
out on an interview.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.307
-(sighs)

35:42.474 --> 35:44.643
We have a way
of doing things around here.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.111
-Exactly.

35:46.212 --> 35:48.214
-Assignments come
from my desk.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.216
-I asked Janice.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.651
Kim's already finished
the Classifieds

35:52.751 --> 35:54.320
and the calendar
for the whole week.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.323
-Hank, uh, really feels
that you'd be invaluable

35:57.423 --> 35:59.591
on the spontaneous
combustion story.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.328
And if you can do it

36:02.428 --> 36:03.929
and keep up
with your other work,

36:04.029 --> 36:06.932
I guess I don't
really have any objections.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.536
-Hey.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.671
You could have
said something.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.673
-How did you
know where I was?

36:14.773 --> 36:16.575
-I asked Janice.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.345
Hey.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.516
-Janice,

36:24.616 --> 36:26.318
did you tell Hank
where to find me?

36:27.519 --> 36:28.854
-Did you have
a good time?

36:28.954 --> 36:31.257
-How did you
know where I was?

36:34.560 --> 36:36.094
-Well, you told me.

36:36.262 --> 36:38.364
-That's funny.
I don't remember
saying anything.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.702
Listen, Eli gave me
that assignment.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.272
-That's what you wanted.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.509
-Yeah, that's what
I wanted.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.383
-Okay, listen.
I'll take the picture.
You handle the text.

36:57.483 --> 37:00.486
I'll give you
first position
on the byline.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.722
-Fima's the woman
who owns the bookstore.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.724
-Is that the woman
from the park.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.293
-Yeah, she lives upstairs.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.127
-Does she have
any idea what happened?

37:09.328 --> 37:11.330
-She said she doesn't.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.602
That's where she jumped from.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.371
-How do you get up there?

37:52.404 --> 37:54.606
Well, someone's
been living up here.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.482
The cops said
there were no witnesses.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.561
Kim...

38:25.737 --> 38:27.439
I'm sorry.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.442
I'm really sorry.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.713
Sometimes
I just don't think.

38:38.116 --> 38:40.652
Will you give me
another chance?

39:13.419 --> 39:17.489
-Listen, thank you
for helping me with Eli today.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.026
-I care about you.

39:23.762 --> 39:26.264
Let's go.

39:26.432 --> 39:29.034
-I want to stay up here
a little while.

39:29.134 --> 39:30.669
-You think you can
find something else?

39:30.769 --> 39:32.471
-Who knows?

40:04.436 --> 40:06.137
Fima?

40:15.581 --> 40:17.449
-(knocking)

40:21.820 --> 40:23.589
-Kim?

40:23.689 --> 40:26.091
-So you do live
behind this door, huh?

40:26.191 --> 40:28.927
-What a nice surprise?

40:31.463 --> 40:34.032
Come in.
-Thank you.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.502
I had a wonderful
time today.

40:36.602 --> 40:37.903
-I'm glad.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.543
I was hoping
you'd stop by.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.479
I just made a pot of tea.
Would you like some?

40:47.579 --> 40:49.080
-I would love some.
Thank you.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.583
-Good.
Make yourself at home.

41:09.535 --> 41:11.436
You left so abruptly.

41:11.537 --> 41:14.906
-Yeah, well,
the job, you know.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.275
-Did you lose it?

41:17.543 --> 41:19.444
-Huh, no, actually,

41:19.545 --> 41:21.680
I got just what I wanted.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.549
-Good.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.787
So you see...

41:30.355 --> 41:31.857
you have to be careful
of what you want

41:31.957 --> 41:33.992
because you might just get it.
-Might just get it.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.694
-It's true.

41:35.794 --> 41:37.162
-So I've heard.

41:38.564 --> 41:39.898
-Come on, sit down.

41:44.302 --> 41:48.874
You see the imagination
is a powerful thing.

41:48.974 --> 41:52.010
If you don't limit it with
narrow-minded thinking and fear

41:52.110 --> 41:54.212
virtually anything
is possible.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.416
Elder bark.

41:58.617 --> 42:00.652
I think you'll like it.

42:13.999 --> 42:15.200
-Hmm, it's bitter.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.035
-Oh, you'll get used it.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.674
So, have you found
what you're looking for?

42:24.075 --> 42:26.344
-I'm feeling
a little nauseous.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.814
-Oh, that'll pass.

42:31.817 --> 42:34.853
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-Mm-hmm.

42:36.822 --> 42:39.024
-You remind me
so much of my daughter.

42:40.626 --> 42:42.260
She was a beautiful child,

42:42.360 --> 42:44.730
so bright
and so full of life.

42:44.830 --> 42:47.633
But I stayed
with my husband
for too long.

42:50.636 --> 42:52.103
Her name was Lily.

42:53.772 --> 42:56.041
I wanted us
to be so close, but...

42:57.042 --> 42:59.477
no matter what I tried,
she always resisted

42:59.645 --> 43:01.246
and we ended up fighting.

43:01.346 --> 43:06.084
And of course Bill,
he always blamed it on me.

43:06.184 --> 43:08.319
It wasn't until
she left school

43:08.419 --> 43:10.756
and she ran away
with her boyfriend...

43:10.856 --> 43:13.058
It was like she was
trying to remove

43:13.158 --> 43:16.494
every last trace
of self-respect.

43:16.662 --> 43:19.698
And it wasn't until then,
that I realized...

43:21.332 --> 43:24.670
that it was
all Bill's fault.

43:28.273 --> 43:29.875
Tell me...

43:34.813 --> 43:37.482
I bet you and--
What's your boyfriend's name?

43:37.716 --> 43:39.050
-Hank?

43:40.451 --> 43:43.121
-Yes, I bet you and Hank
have great sex.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.692
-Well, sure we do.

43:47.893 --> 43:49.527
-And yet when it's over,
you have the feeling

43:49.695 --> 43:51.362
that something is missing?

43:53.098 --> 43:55.701
-Nothing's perfect, you know?

43:58.804 --> 44:02.708
-Yes, there is this
perseity quality to men.

44:04.009 --> 44:06.444
And you have to get it out
in order to gain power

44:06.712 --> 44:08.413
of your own self.

44:10.415 --> 44:11.983
Now look what
you've done.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.384
Take this.

44:14.986 --> 44:17.055
No, under the saucer.

44:18.724 --> 44:20.325
Okay, okay,
that's enough.

44:20.425 --> 44:22.127
Not on the table.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.730
Give it to me.

44:35.741 --> 44:37.342
(huffs)

44:38.509 --> 44:40.812
Take one of these.
It'll help.

44:49.387 --> 44:51.189
Kim, eat it.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.301
-(groans)

45:03.401 --> 45:05.136
(gasps)

45:05.236 --> 45:06.404
-Here.

45:08.039 --> 45:09.775
-(moans)

45:13.845 --> 45:17.115
(groaning)

45:47.478 --> 45:49.414
-(laughing)

45:51.082 --> 45:53.952
(laughter echoes)

46:10.368 --> 46:12.904
-It's completely normal.

46:41.099 --> 46:42.600
-(moans)

46:42.868 --> 46:44.903
-Katherine:
Good.

46:48.206 --> 46:50.075
-Good.

46:58.349 --> 46:59.550
-(moans)

47:04.355 --> 47:06.958
-(moans)

47:36.988 --> 47:38.556
-Now, Ricky.

47:47.065 --> 47:48.934
-(chittering)

47:54.372 --> 47:56.007
-(Kim groans)

47:57.508 --> 47:59.277
-Earth to earth.

48:00.411 --> 48:03.114
Mother to daughter.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.589
-(screeching)

48:14.625 --> 48:16.194
-Katherine:
Enter.

48:18.263 --> 48:19.797
-(screeches)

48:19.965 --> 48:23.201
-(screams)
-(creature chitters)

48:23.301 --> 48:26.972
-(screaming)

48:29.407 --> 48:32.043
(screaming continues)

48:36.681 --> 48:38.984
(gasps)
-Make your fear real.

48:40.051 --> 48:41.619
Get it out.

48:44.322 --> 48:47.325
-(gagging)

49:05.243 --> 49:08.346
(gasping)

49:11.682 --> 49:14.152
-(screeching)

49:47.085 --> 49:48.686
(gasps)

50:43.774 --> 50:46.043
-(door opens)

50:50.648 --> 50:52.817
-Don't leave.

50:54.185 --> 50:57.054
-No!
-What's the matter?

50:58.623 --> 51:00.558
-You're not
leaving are you?

51:00.658 --> 51:02.460
-Just leave me alone?

51:02.560 --> 51:04.562
-Oh, but you seemed ill.

51:04.662 --> 51:06.597
Dear, you fell asleep.

51:07.798 --> 51:09.267
Are you all right?

51:09.367 --> 51:12.203
Come on, you don't
have to leave.

51:13.204 --> 51:15.240
-You have to finish,
you know?

51:16.207 --> 51:18.176
-What do you
want from me?

51:19.610 --> 51:21.746
-I want my daughter back.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.350
-(gasps)

51:38.363 --> 51:39.530
-Get Ricky.

51:39.630 --> 51:41.299
-(grunts)

51:57.382 --> 51:59.184
Hank?

52:10.595 --> 52:12.230
Hank?

52:14.632 --> 52:16.834
-Kim, where you been?

52:18.436 --> 52:20.271
What time is it?

52:28.413 --> 52:29.847
What's going on?

52:30.881 --> 52:32.383
Are you okay?

52:39.790 --> 52:41.392
Have you
been drinking, Kim?

52:42.427 --> 52:43.794
-I want my key back!

52:43.894 --> 52:45.530
I can't deal with this,
understand?

52:45.630 --> 52:47.332
-What?

52:48.533 --> 52:49.534
-(keys jingle)

52:50.601 --> 52:53.338
-I feel sick to my stomach
and I have a headache.

52:53.438 --> 52:54.339
-Well...

52:54.439 --> 52:55.473
-Don't crowd me!

52:55.573 --> 52:58.243
Don't you understand?
I need some room!

53:01.946 --> 53:03.748
-(keys jingle)

53:03.848 --> 53:05.750
-(rattling)

53:05.850 --> 53:07.352
-Kim?

53:07.452 --> 53:08.953
Kim, stop it!

53:12.857 --> 53:15.260
-(flushes)
-Just calm down.

53:21.532 --> 53:22.900
What are you doing?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.635
-(gagging)
-Stop it!

53:24.735 --> 53:26.003
Stop it!

53:26.271 --> 53:28.406
Stop it!
-(gags)

53:29.374 --> 53:30.475
-(glass shatters)

53:37.815 --> 53:39.884
-(crying)

53:44.855 --> 53:47.292
-It's gonna
be all right.

53:52.430 --> 53:53.964
(sobbing)

54:01.806 --> 54:03.040
(sobs)

54:03.308 --> 54:05.310
-Hey, it's okay.

54:05.376 --> 54:07.345
-(crying)
-It's okay,
go ahead and cry.

54:07.445 --> 54:09.880
-(muffled crying)

54:09.980 --> 54:11.516
-It's okay.

54:12.917 --> 54:14.419
It's gonna be all right.

54:14.519 --> 54:16.521
-(whimpering)

54:42.847 --> 54:45.416
Hank, is that you?

54:47.051 --> 54:49.620
What are you doing here?

54:51.088 --> 54:53.424
-What happened tonight?

54:54.659 --> 54:56.761
-It's strange.

55:05.970 --> 55:08.038
You were sleeping.

55:18.115 --> 55:20.518
You look like
a little boy in this.

55:23.921 --> 55:25.456
Hmm.

55:33.398 --> 55:35.733
I wish you hadn't woken up.

55:53.117 --> 55:55.620
I like to touch you
when you're sleeping,

55:55.720 --> 55:57.722
make you hard.

55:59.490 --> 56:01.091
(moaning)

56:04.995 --> 56:08.165
Relax, relax.

56:08.433 --> 56:10.535
Don't be so tense.

56:10.635 --> 56:12.537
Close your eyes.

56:19.677 --> 56:22.447
I want to fuck you
while you're sleeping.

56:26.451 --> 56:27.785
Be still.

56:31.956 --> 56:33.791
-(water running)

56:45.536 --> 56:47.838
-(Kim moaning)

56:59.484 --> 57:00.685
-Hmm?

57:04.755 --> 57:06.156
-(clicks)

57:07.525 --> 57:10.561
-Laura: And roller skates...
-(Kim pants)

57:11.261 --> 57:13.498

-(moans)

57:13.531 --> 57:15.332
-(Ricky laughs)
-Laura:
...a Micky Mouse watch,

57:15.566 --> 57:16.934
and a doll.

57:17.034 --> 57:19.203
(Laura screams)
-Kim. No, don't stop.

57:23.674 --> 57:26.110
-Come back.
-Who the fuck are you?

57:29.914 --> 57:32.617
-Santa Claus killer.
-(screaming)

57:32.717 --> 57:34.619
Get the hell of here.

57:36.587 --> 57:39.524
-Dr Newbury:
Laura, Laura, okay, all right,
you're dreaming.

57:39.590 --> 57:41.792
-Kim?
-Dr Newbury: You're back now.

57:41.892 --> 57:44.161
It's all right.
All right.

57:45.530 --> 57:47.932
-Hey, Kim, come on.
We got to go.

57:51.969 --> 57:53.337
-You leave her alone.

57:53.538 --> 57:56.106
-What'd you do that for?

57:56.206 --> 57:58.543
-Go on!
Get out of here!

58:01.311 --> 58:02.780
Now, I don't know
who you are,

58:02.880 --> 58:04.348
but I want you
out of here.

58:04.582 --> 58:05.950
-No, man.

58:06.050 --> 58:07.585
She's got to come with me.

58:10.888 --> 58:11.956
(grunts)

58:12.923 --> 58:14.158
(grunts)

58:15.826 --> 58:18.663
-(thudding)

58:35.813 --> 58:37.682
-(thudding)

58:52.262 --> 58:54.198
-Don't fuck with me.

58:56.701 --> 58:57.935
-(groans)

59:01.706 --> 59:03.007
-Come on out now!

59:16.120 --> 59:17.922

-(Hank coughs)

59:30.367 --> 59:32.102
-Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!

59:32.202 --> 59:34.071
Get away from there.

59:34.171 --> 59:35.239
-Ow.

59:35.339 --> 59:38.843
-What do you think I am?
Dumb or something?

59:38.943 --> 59:41.478
-Please just stop, stop!

59:41.646 --> 59:44.114
Stop! Just leave her alone.

59:44.214 --> 59:45.783
-Oh, like you own her.

59:45.883 --> 59:48.686
-(phone ringing)

59:48.786 --> 59:50.921
-Kim: Hello, this is Kim.
I'm not home right now,

59:51.021 --> 59:52.356
Leave a message.
-(beeps)

59:52.456 --> 59:55.259

where are you?
Are you home?

59:55.359 --> 59:57.361
-(indistinct chatter)

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:04.001
-Janice! Janice!
Call the police! Hurry!

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:07.071
Call the police!
(screams)

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:13.377

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:17.347
Let me go!

01:00:18.182 --> 01:00:19.383
Let me go!

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:24.989

Oh! Let go!

-(gargled screams)

01:01:19.944 --> 01:01:21.912
-Come on out now.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.859
-(whimpering)

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.296
-(door opens)
-Janice: Kim, are you here?

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:40.965
-Oh, shit!

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:01.151
-Are you crazy?

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:09.794
Kim.
-He was all over me.

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:24.008
-He killed Hank.
-I had to!

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:26.010
He hit me first.

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:28.846
-Are you okay?

01:02:29.814 --> 01:02:31.548
I want you to
go back with Ricky now.

01:02:31.816 --> 01:02:33.117
He won't hurt you.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.252
You have to finish.

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:38.956
They're waiting for you.

01:02:43.027 --> 01:02:44.528
Come on, come on now.

01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:46.330
I'll clean up.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.032
Go straight over there.

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:50.200
She's not gonna
give you any more trouble.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.269
-Well, I'm taking this.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.976
-(door closes)
-(sighs)

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.388
-(banging echoes)

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:13.323
-Let me out!

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:18.863
-(liquid splatters)

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.149
(splattering continues)

01:03:42.887 --> 01:03:43.888
-(cries)

01:03:47.124 --> 01:03:48.558
(sobs)

01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:54.531
(sobbing)

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:01.505
-(women whisper)
-Woman: She is awake.

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:04.008
-(whispering continues)

01:04:09.914 --> 01:04:11.615
-Woman:
Let's get her to drink.

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:21.425
She's drinking.
-Fima: There we go.

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:24.028
-(women whispering)

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:31.535
It's almost time.

01:04:39.944 --> 01:04:41.946
(whispering continues)

01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:47.351
-See? I told you
everything was
gonna be okay.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:54.959
-Daughter of Isis,
fire of Lilith...

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:57.394
-As above, so below.

01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:59.296
-Why do we have
to do it in here?

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.331
-(women laugh)

01:05:08.973 --> 01:05:11.976
-Horus, son of Isis,
lover of Isis...

01:05:13.477 --> 01:05:16.013
-Bring down
the dark rule.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:19.016
-(women moan)

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:24.188
-(oil squelches)

01:05:25.189 --> 01:05:27.992
-It's not easy
to give birth to yourself.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:35.599
-(screams)

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:41.205
(crying screams)

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:45.575
-(triumphant shouts)

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:48.012
-(screaming)

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:55.352
(screaming)

01:06:20.044 --> 01:06:21.411
(groans)

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:44.301
(groaning)

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.405
(screams)

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.577
-(crunching)
-(creature chittering)

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:56.680
-(screams, panting)
-(screeching)

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.821
-(grunts)

01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:06.623
(shouts)

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:12.096
(screaming)

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:22.439
-(crunching)

01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:59.743
-(screeches)

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:40.184
-(speaking foreign language)

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:58.468
You have been initiated.

01:08:58.568 --> 01:08:59.969
You go.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:01.069
Now.

01:09:01.205 --> 01:09:03.540
(speaking foreign language)

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:12.616
-(typing)

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.822
(continues typing)

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:23.292
-Lily.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.265
-Lily?

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:33.403
The woman who jumped.

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:37.474
-Yes.

01:09:39.376 --> 01:09:41.245
She was my daughter.

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:47.251
She was too weak.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.423
But now you've come
to take her place.

01:10:02.266 --> 01:10:05.302
-What did you do to me?

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:07.804
-Well, you did it.
-And we're very proud of you.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:09.306
-You're one of us now.

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:11.775
-You're free of men
and the parasite of fear

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:13.477
they bring us.
-(laughs)

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:15.879
I don't believe this.
This isn't real.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:18.848
I've been hallucinating.
You drugged me.

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.984
-No, it's not hallucinations.

01:10:22.486 --> 01:10:23.853
You...

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.656
gave form
to the fear inside you.

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:31.395
You created these things
from the power of magic

01:10:31.495 --> 01:10:32.996
within you.

01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:37.301
-What about Hank?
Did he really die?

01:10:39.703 --> 01:10:41.538
-Hank's just a man.

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:50.280
-But you're not finished.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.750
We need a life
to feed your fears.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.820
-Hank had a brother, a boy.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.221
-Lonnie?

01:10:58.322 --> 01:11:00.424
What are you
talking about?

01:11:00.524 --> 01:11:01.691
-Power...

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.728
is responsibility.

01:11:05.829 --> 01:11:08.632
You have to
nurture your power.

01:11:10.334 --> 01:11:11.535
-Bring us the boy.

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:14.704
-I can't.
-Ricky'll help you.

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:15.939
-No!

01:11:18.342 --> 01:11:19.943
-You have to
or the fire will destroy you.

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.778
-You're crazy!

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.350
-The boy!
-(door closes)

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:31.721
-There's no evidence
of anything going on here.

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:34.691
-He was killed in here.
I saw it.

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:37.026
He was stabbed.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.398
-I don't see anything.

01:11:42.566 --> 01:11:44.000
There's no blood.

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:49.072
-He stabbed
the door, come on.

01:11:58.047 --> 01:11:59.849
The mirror.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:24.641
-Ma'am,
are you in therapy?

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.478
-No! I'm not in therapy!

01:12:31.648 --> 01:12:34.551
-Well, would you like me
to recommend somebody for you?

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:38.154
-Merry Christmas.

01:12:38.422 --> 01:12:39.889
-Hank's not here, is he?

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:41.825
-Hank's out of town
on assignment.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:43.660
You knew that.
-No, I didn't know that!

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.261
I don't know what
you're talking about!

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:47.130
-You got his job, right?

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:49.466
-That's what
you wanted, wasn't it?

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.770
-Ho ho ho, if it isn't
the Virgin Mary.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:54.904
(laughing)

01:12:58.442 --> 01:12:59.909
-You look wonderful.

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:02.446
Welcome to the family.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:05.649
Now, you have to
bring us the boy.

01:13:58.835 --> 01:13:59.836
-(knocking)

01:14:01.571 --> 01:14:03.507
(banging)

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:12.882
-(sighs)

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:22.759
-You have no choice.

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:27.396
You must bring the boy.

01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:29.365
You must defeat your fears

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:31.835
or they'll feed on you.

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:39.208
-(groans)

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:01.698
Help me!
Please, help me!

01:15:01.798 --> 01:15:03.667
-Do what she says
and it'll stop.

01:15:03.767 --> 01:15:06.402
-Okay, I'll do
what she says.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:08.872
(panting)

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.944
It stopped.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.648
I'll do what she says.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.588
(coughing)

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:30.226
-(static crackles)

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:34.130
-Gus: Hey, come on, smile.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.999
Ho ho ho,
come on.

01:15:36.099 --> 01:15:38.001
-Great.

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:40.036
-Well, what
the hell's the matter?
Don't you like it?

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:41.204
-I said I liked it.

01:15:41.304 --> 01:15:42.505
-Well, smile a little bit.

01:15:42.606 --> 01:15:44.608
Will you?
-Gus! You know,
I think there's

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:47.143
another package
under that tree
with your name on it.

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:49.613
-Let me see
if I can find it, hmm?

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.726
-Well?

01:16:05.962 --> 01:16:07.363
-No, no, not like that.

01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:08.965
I'll get him.

01:16:14.938 --> 01:16:16.172
What are you doing?

01:16:16.272 --> 01:16:17.774
-I'm gonna back you up.

01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:19.809
-No.
Just wait here.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:34.123
-Hank?
-Hah.

01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:35.725
-Oh, I don't think

01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:37.827
Hank's gonna be
able to be with us
this Christmas, Lonnie.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:41.030
-Well, at least he could
have had the decency to call.

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:44.133
-Maybe it is him.
-Gus, please.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.769
-Hey, no, Lonnie!
I told you

01:16:45.869 --> 01:16:48.905
not to answer the door
by yourself late at night.

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:51.107
-Hank?
-Merry Christmas.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.509
-Hi, Hank's not
with you, is he?

01:16:53.677 --> 01:16:54.577
-Sure he is.
He's out in the car.

01:16:54.678 --> 01:16:55.979
Do you want to come out
and talk to him?

01:16:56.079 --> 01:16:57.113
-I knew it.

01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:04.888
Hank?

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:12.061
Where is he?

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:13.730
-Um, he'll be right back.

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:16.599
So what do you
want for Christmas?

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.702
Will you just
go out there and get him

01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:19.936
and bring him
back in here?

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:21.871
I want to get
some more pictures
under the tree.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:24.708
-Lonnie?
-This is great.

01:17:25.441 --> 01:17:26.810
This is just great.

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:28.945
-Merry Christmas.

01:17:29.045 --> 01:17:30.579
-(screams)

01:17:30.714 --> 01:17:32.816
-Hey, what the hell
is going on there?

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.819
Jeez!
-Just relax, man.

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:40.523
-Come on,
you filthy scum!
Get up!

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:42.025
Come on!

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:43.026
-(screaming)
-Come on, you--

01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:44.894
(screaming)

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:48.832
No! No! No!

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:54.738
(choking)

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:57.941
(gagging)

01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:08.985
-(dog barking)
-I got to go back.

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:11.154
-No, wait, you can't.

01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:15.091
-(car engine runs)
-Hey, wait!

01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:19.763
-Let me out!

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:39.382
No!

01:18:40.817 --> 01:18:42.051
Let me go!

01:18:55.799 --> 01:18:58.835
What are you doing?

01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:00.236
Don't hurt me!

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:09.813
No!

01:19:10.513 --> 01:19:12.215
You have to kill him.

01:19:12.315 --> 01:19:15.118
-What are you
doing to me?

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:27.096
-Remember,

01:19:27.196 --> 01:19:29.432
your fears aren't real.

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:33.436
-(screeching)

01:19:40.844 --> 01:19:42.511
-Go on, Lily, do it now.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:47.150
-Kill the man.

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:49.485
Become a whole woman.

01:19:49.585 --> 01:19:52.188
-But he's just a boy.

01:19:54.057 --> 01:19:55.691
-You have no choice.

01:19:55.859 --> 01:19:58.161
You made the decision
when you came to me.

01:19:58.261 --> 01:20:00.196
This is the final step!

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:02.866
Do it now.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:10.206
-Kill him.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:17.546
-I knew she wouldn't.

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.815
-Why do you
always defy me?

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:22.318
What's the matter
with you?

01:20:22.418 --> 01:20:25.955
After all that I have
done for you!

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:36.499
-Kill him.
-Do it.

01:20:36.599 --> 01:20:39.202
-I can't.
-Kill him.

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.371
Kill him now.

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:44.874
-No!

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:49.946
-(women grunting)

01:20:52.982 --> 01:20:54.283
-Fima?

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:58.988
-Run, Lonnie!

01:21:18.641 --> 01:21:21.010
-No, man,
don't hurt her.

01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:23.079
(groans)

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.649
(whimpers)
-(bones crunching)

01:21:28.184 --> 01:21:30.419
-(strangled grunts)

01:21:30.519 --> 01:21:34.090
-(creatures screeching)

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:39.963
-(gasping)

01:21:48.304 --> 01:21:49.738
-You see?

01:21:49.973 --> 01:21:52.141
Didn't I warn you?

01:21:53.176 --> 01:21:55.344
Why didn't you
listen to me?

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.447
Now you're
going to burn

01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:01.250
and I won't
have a daughter.

01:22:02.685 --> 01:22:04.387
-You never cared about me.

01:22:04.487 --> 01:22:06.589
You never cared
about your daughter

01:22:06.689 --> 01:22:08.857
or anyone else
but yourself!

01:22:08.992 --> 01:22:11.660
Well, I'm not like you!

01:22:21.304 --> 01:22:23.072
-But you are me.

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:24.673
You are.

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:37.653
-No, I'm not you!

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:41.724
I'm not gonna
die for you either!

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:45.028
-(grunts)

01:22:46.529 --> 01:22:48.497
-(shrieking)

01:22:52.168 --> 01:22:56.105
(screaming)

01:22:58.107 --> 01:22:59.708
(screams)

01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:31.407
-Lonnie?

01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:40.149
It's all over now.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.472

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:53.216
