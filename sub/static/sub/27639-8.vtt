[panting]

00:03.170 --> 00:04.536
Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.938
Enrique.
Why you running?

00:06.941 --> 00:08.240
High cholesterol.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.376
Also, some kids
on the corner are
being very aggressive.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.410
[Appa] Uh-huh.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.147
Do you have
any protein bars?

00:15.215 --> 00:17.116
-Bottom shelf.
-Ah. Okay.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.085
Okay. Can you
help me, please?

00:20.153 --> 00:21.253
Just stop running.

00:21.321 --> 00:22.554
I have to keep
my heart rate up.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.390
Then come back
and buy protein bar
after you finish.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.025
Well, it'll be dark
by then

00:27.094 --> 00:29.862
and the kids most likely
will get more aggressive
after dark.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.133
Ah, I love almonds.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.136
But all the water
that they use to grow them
is an outrage.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.471
-Did you know that in a sin...
-Banana. Final offer.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.340
Great! I had one
yesterday, but great.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.310
Sorry, I don't have
anything smaller.

00:47.314 --> 00:48.247
No problem.

00:53.087 --> 00:56.488
-Six, eight, ten.
-Okay.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.923
-Twenty.
-Great.

00:58.425 --> 00:59.491
Thirty.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.095
-Forty.
-All right.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.430
-[Appa] Eight.
-[Enrique] Hoo!

01:04.498 --> 01:06.231
-Nine.
-Okay.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.833
-Fifty.
-Thank you.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.168
-Merry Christmas.
-[coins jingling]

01:10.570 --> 01:12.871
All right. Looks like
this is going to be
an expensive run.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.539
No pain, no gain.

01:14.608 --> 01:15.707
Yeah!

01:15.775 --> 01:17.709
[theme music playing]

01:36.397 --> 01:37.963
[Pastor Nina]
I'd never caught
a home run before,

01:38.031 --> 01:40.065
but since it was
the other team,
I threw it back.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.533
-Good for you.
-Mmm.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.002
And then I saw the
little girl standing there
with her glove out.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.204
Oh. So you look
like a monster.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.473
-Little bit.
-Mmm.

01:48.943 --> 01:49.942
Hi.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.579
-Nice sign.
-Oh, thank you.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.683
Yeah. I learn from YouTube
how to do bubble letter.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.152
Make word dance
like a cartoon, uh?

02:00.220 --> 02:01.353
Oh!

02:01.421 --> 02:03.488
[Appa] Uh, not really dance,
just look like.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.724
No. You are missing
the letter "O".

02:06.593 --> 02:07.892
Oh.

02:07.962 --> 02:11.062
It's okay. People understand
word is "discount".
No big deal.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.198
Well, in this case,
it's kind of a big deal.

02:13.266 --> 02:14.900
What's a big deal?

02:14.968 --> 02:20.038
Okay. So, there are words
that refer to
certain female genitalia.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.707
Like genitalia, or loins,

02:22.776 --> 02:23.842
or lady garden.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.677
Yeah?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.379
Look, it is
a part of my body

02:27.447 --> 02:28.980
and God created it
and it is good,

02:29.049 --> 02:31.082
but then there are
other words for that

02:31.151 --> 02:33.118
-which are offensive. Like...
-[door bell jingle]

02:33.187 --> 02:35.020
Oh, Pastor Nina!
Good to see you.

02:35.088 --> 02:36.421
Hi, Mrs. Kim.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.490
Yobo, what you doing?

02:38.559 --> 02:40.392
Ah, talk about
Pastor Nina vagina?

02:40.460 --> 02:41.760
[Umma]
Why you talking about that?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.628
-Sorry, Pastor Nina.
-It's all right.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.765
No. You say it's good.
God make.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.768
Anyway, I should go. Away.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.603
From this conversation.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.338
-Bye.
-Have a good one.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.040
-[door bell jingles]
-Bye, Pastor Nina.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.708
[door closes]

02:56.776 --> 02:59.411
-Why you make this?
-Okay, I change.

03:01.147 --> 03:04.283
Why make such a big deal
for such a small "O", huh?

03:05.652 --> 03:06.652
There, I fix.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.755
Maybe I make sign
from now on, no?

03:09.823 --> 03:10.789
[Appa] Yes.

03:17.131 --> 03:20.198
-You took it down?
-Yeah. No more discount today.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.600
Nothing good ever lasts.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.773
That's awesome, babe.
I knew you could do it.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.475
Did you finally kill
the spider in the shower?

03:30.543 --> 03:33.378
Oh, stop reminding me
about that thing.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.914
Gerald got shortlisted
for a photography internship.

03:35.982 --> 03:37.816
[Gerald] I don't even
remember applying.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.184
Wow. That's weird.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.685
[Chelsea] I'm not surprised.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.220
Maybe I should
cancel my credit cards.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.423
No, don't.
I applied for you.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.558
Why would you do that?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.860
Because you wouldn't.
And look how it turned out.

03:48.928 --> 03:51.463
She's right.
Everything happens
for a reason.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.331
And that reason is me.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.867
[Gerald] Yeah, but it's
become this whole thing.

03:55.935 --> 04:01.006
Like... Like... I have to
get a bunch of stuff,
like a reference letter.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.574
You're just making it a thing.
It's one letter.

04:02.642 --> 04:04.009
-[Chelsea] Mmm-hmm.
-[Gerald] To you.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.944
I've got a lot going on
over the next few days.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.413
I was going to do
some groceries,
curling's on,

04:08.482 --> 04:11.016
my sister emailed.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.784
-You're in the weeds, babe.
-[Gerald] Mmm.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.886
Figure it out, Gerald.
I had to
figure out your password.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.955
Which I'll be changing.

04:17.023 --> 04:19.891
You know,
soon as I get a chance.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.028
Still, I'm proud of you
for getting this far.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.365
Ya little keener.
[chuckles]

04:31.371 --> 04:33.138
Well, hope you and your mom
enjoy the extra space.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.439
[Kimchee] Will do.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.708
And tell her it's not a problem
that I offered up my room.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.809
[Kimchee] Done.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.078
Just gonna be staying
on Janet's couch.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.080
Sounds good, bud.

04:42.148 --> 04:44.549
Okay. Well, uh,
have a good visit.

04:44.551 --> 04:45.984
[door opens and closes]

04:54.427 --> 04:56.394
[door opens and closes]

04:56.463 --> 04:59.698
-Uh, hey.
-Yo.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.867
Uh, I just wanted to
hold this in my hands

05:02.870 --> 05:04.369
to remember to
show it to my mom.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.104
Ah! Great memories.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.039
Yeah, I love that picture.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.108
I mean, not so good
of Umma and Janet, but.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.344
'Kay, I'm just going to
go grab a toothbrush.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.781
-Uh, Kimch?
-Ya, bro?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.483
Why is my toothbrush
in the garbage?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.186
Yours is old.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.689
I thought I'd get you a new
one as a thank you for giving
up your room.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.625
Wait, hold up.
What is going on?

05:26.693 --> 05:30.495
-Uh...
-When did we become
such responsible adults?

05:30.497 --> 05:33.098
Me giving up my room,
you replacing my toothbrush.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.400
-What?
-Yeah!

05:35.468 --> 05:37.135
-We're adulting hard.
-Yeah.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.670
Get outta here!

05:38.738 --> 05:40.272
-Kay. Bye-ee.
-Bye-ee!

05:40.807 --> 05:42.140
[door closes]

05:44.611 --> 05:46.277
Good price for waffle cookies.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.314
Best price. Very good deal,
but won't last long.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.183
Lots of other good deal, too.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.418
Almost too good to be true.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.554
-How do we do it?
-Yeah.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.722
Lots of nice sign.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.591
Okay. I going to wholesale.

05:59.659 --> 06:01.193
Uh, we almost out of corn.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.528
-Maybe you can spell for me.
-C-O-R--

06:03.597 --> 06:04.963
I said maybe!

06:06.666 --> 06:09.000
He a little bit upset.
Funny story.

06:09.068 --> 06:12.804
Mr. Kim make sign before
and he make such big mistake.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.274
Oh, English is
such a hard language.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.176
That's why I'm taking classes.

06:18.244 --> 06:19.711
I understand.

06:19.779 --> 06:22.480
You know, I been here
so long time now,

06:22.483 --> 06:24.916
my English is almost
better than my Korean.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.619
Yes, it's quite good.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.254
Mmm. Some say very good.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.856
Oh. I see
Mr. Kim's mistake now.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.625
"Bean" is B-E-A-N.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.527
This been is
past tense of being.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.028
Oh, yeah.
[chuckles nervously]

06:37.096 --> 06:39.964
I leave sign up
so Mr. Kim don't feel so bad.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.566
-Oh, that's nice.
-Mmm.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.402
Oh. This one, too.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.103
He spelled "off" with one "F".

06:45.171 --> 06:47.472
Oh, I used to
do that a lot, too.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.340
I know!

06:49.409 --> 06:52.177
Uh, but Mr. Kim
don't know, obviously.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.012
So embarrass for him.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.680
And this sign.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.349
Yeah, "pop" should have
a capital "P".

06:58.251 --> 06:59.484
No. That's not...

06:59.552 --> 07:01.619
Okay. Write down
all mistake you see

07:01.688 --> 07:03.221
and I tell Mr. Kim
and he fix.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.324
"He will fix."

07:06.326 --> 07:07.459
Yeah. He fix.

07:16.669 --> 07:19.738
It's so nice of you to give
your roommate and his mom
the whole apartment.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.673
Without asking us first.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.608
Remember the time
you did that, Gerald?

07:23.676 --> 07:26.377
And the person
came to stay with us,
for like, forever?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.413
God, those people
are the worst!

07:28.481 --> 07:30.148
Honestly, it's not
that big of a deal.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.616
Kimchee's mom
doesn't visit that often,

07:31.684 --> 07:33.785
so thought I'd
give them some space.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.420
He's trying to suck up to her.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.222
Kimchee's mom isn't a big fan.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.723
Oh?

07:38.791 --> 07:40.692
What are you talking about?
Angie loves me.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.627
In a love-hate kind of way.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.696
Or maybe I'm
thinking of Mrs. Pyo.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.564
-Barely knew Mrs. Pyo.
-Or Mrs. Chan.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.034
Or Mrs. Park. Or Mrs. Yang.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.268
Do all the moms not like you?

07:50.270 --> 07:53.204
Mrs. Song likes him.
She has a thing for bad boys.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.506
-So does this one.
-[chuckles]

07:55.441 --> 07:56.608
Kimchee's mom likes me.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.376
Yeah. I shouldn't get involved.

07:58.444 --> 08:00.245
-That'd be a first.
-[Chelsea] Ooh.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.546
Why? What'd she do?

08:01.548 --> 08:03.415
I got Gerald an internship.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.649
[Jung] Oh. Brutal.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.418
That's a good thing.
For Gerald.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.553
I still don't know how you
figured out my password.

08:08.621 --> 08:12.257
Oh, Gerald, don't you know
not to question the...

08:12.325 --> 08:14.659
Ah! What do you call it
with the strings
and the Pinocchio guys?

08:14.728 --> 08:15.794
Puppeteer.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.028
Ah, not the word
I was looking for,

08:17.030 --> 08:18.563
but yeah, Janet's the puppeteer

08:18.631 --> 08:21.466
-and we're all her little...
-Puppets.

08:21.534 --> 08:24.236
No. Anyway, Janet's that.
You get it.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.205
Yeah. Like how she
maneuvered everything to
always get the good chair.

08:27.273 --> 08:28.573
What?

08:28.641 --> 08:31.743
She leaves jellybeans
on this side table
so Gerald sits there.

08:31.811 --> 08:34.045
-Is that true?
-Hey, this is not
the good chair.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.947
And she puts the power bar here
so I'll charge my phone.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.683
-[chuckles] Brutal.
-[Chelsea] Mmm-hmm.

08:38.751 --> 08:42.821
That's a really elaborate plan
for a chair with a blanket
and lots of leg room.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.690
Oh! Marionette! Marionette.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.325
Kay, puppets.
I'm going to crash.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.399
-[camera clicking]
-[Angie] My son, the manager.

08:54.401 --> 08:55.700
Assistant manager.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.302
Oh, close enough.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.903
[Shannon] Still on tour?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.939
Should I do
my thing again?

09:01.007 --> 09:04.309
Exits, here and here,
with bathrooms in the rear.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.610
Oh, wait. Sorry. That way.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.178
Oh, I'm all mixed up.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.347
Still good. A little funnier
the first time.

09:09.415 --> 09:12.284
Anyways, enjoy your lunch.
I'm taking off.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.486
Oh. Turbulence.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.722
You should easily be able
to take her job.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.490
She's actually super-qualified.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.593
-We should go.
-Okay.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.795
But I gotta go make my bladder
a little gladder.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.463
Don't always need to know,
but thanks.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.067
Hey, man.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.969
Jung, what are you doing here?
It's your day off.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.470
I just came to say hi
to your mom.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.972
Unless you're avoiding me,
or something.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.108
What? Get outta here
with that talk.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.010
Seriously, go on, get out.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.679
What's going on?

09:40.681 --> 09:43.615
Okay. You're my best friend,
so I need you to work
with me on this one, okay?

09:43.683 --> 09:46.918
There's a guy in the ladies'
talking to his mom.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.887
-I'll go later.
-[Kimchee] Jung Kim!

09:48.955 --> 09:52.023
Of all the car rentals,
you had to walk into mine.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.692
Hey, oh! Mom,
you remember Jung Kim.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.027
Hi, Mrs. Han.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.329
I thought you were in prison.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.097
Ah, no.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.565
Haven't seen each other
in how long?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.700
A day?

10:02.769 --> 10:05.203
Three months and seven years.
[chuckles]

10:05.271 --> 10:07.005
Just before they locked you up.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.040
Okay.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.541
You know, the last time
I saw you,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.477
you were hiding pot
under Kimchee's bed

10:12.545 --> 10:15.146
and stashing pornos
in our ceiling tiles.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.715
-Sorry?
-And stealing my jewelry.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.684
-I forgot about that.
-[exhales]

10:19.752 --> 10:21.853
Look, I know
I wasn't perfect back then.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.622
Jung, it was so good to see you.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.791
Good luck with the car
you rented. Ah, don't steal it.
[chuckles]

10:26.860 --> 10:28.893
Hey, Jung. Why are you here
on your day off?

10:28.961 --> 10:32.664
Obviously his day off from
working at another company.

10:32.666 --> 10:36.734
But he happens to know Terence,
who happens
to know his schedule.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.037
I also know where
we keep all the good pens.
Hello.

10:39.105 --> 10:42.374
Actually, I could use some help
with the car I rented
out in the lot.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.941
Want to help me
with that, Kimchee?

10:44.010 --> 10:46.444
Ha! When was the last time
I was able to help you out
with something, huh?

10:46.512 --> 10:49.247
Seven years, three months
and a day! I mean, come on.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.016
Okay. See you.

10:52.752 --> 10:54.218
-[door opens and closes]
-[tinkling door chimes]

10:54.221 --> 10:56.054
Hey, Appa. Is Umma around?

10:56.122 --> 10:57.055
[tinkling door chimes]

10:59.225 --> 11:01.192
Okay, I get it!
I'll check back later.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.227
Stop!

11:02.796 --> 11:03.962
What you need from Umma?

11:04.030 --> 11:05.596
I give her message.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.765
I could, but where's
the mystery in that?

11:07.768 --> 11:10.201
Leave a message
after beep. BEEP.

11:10.269 --> 11:14.372
Oh. Okay: Hey, Umma. It's Janet.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.374
-What you doing?
-I was just playing along.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.977
This not a game.
Hurry up, Janet.
What's message?

11:19.045 --> 11:20.178
Oh, my God.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.580
Okay, I submitted
an application
for Gerald

11:22.648 --> 11:24.449
and now he needs
a reference letter
for, like,

11:24.517 --> 11:26.551
the next stage, so I thought
maybe Umma could write it.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.520
-Oh.
-Cause she was his
previous employer

11:28.588 --> 11:30.722
and he also took her photo
so she knows him

11:30.790 --> 11:32.390
both as an employee
and a photographer.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.293
I was a previous employer.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.296
-You were.
-And he take my photo.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.464
He did.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.100
So why you not
ask me to write
a referee letter?

11:43.269 --> 11:44.402
Well, I thought about it

11:44.470 --> 11:46.938
but then I thought about
how busy you are
with the store

11:47.006 --> 11:49.774
and... Golf...

11:49.842 --> 11:52.310
You don't think
I am good
at write English.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.812
No! Your English is great.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.215
Tell you what:
why don't I write
the letter,

11:57.217 --> 11:59.084
then you sign it. Teamwork!

11:59.152 --> 12:00.418
No. Tell you what.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.923
I write letter
then I sign. Hmm?

12:05.592 --> 12:06.657
Okay.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.594
I will write good letter.
You'll see.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.695
-Umma will see.
-[keyboard clacking]

12:11.531 --> 12:13.798
Everyone will see.

12:13.866 --> 12:15.700
-Why would everyone--
-Beep. Machine full.

12:23.943 --> 12:25.143
You weren't supposed to be here.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.612
Apparently, I wasn't
supposed to be
in your life at all.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.980
What the hell?

12:28.982 --> 12:31.048
My mom hates you. Always has.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.718
Huh. Maybe 'cause
of the pot I stashed
under your bed?

12:33.786 --> 12:34.686
Probably.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.953
Or the porn I hid
in your ceiling?

12:36.022 --> 12:37.288
Well, that definitely
didn't help.

12:37.356 --> 12:38.589
Except I never did those things!

12:38.658 --> 12:40.158
-Maybe you just forgot!
-Kimch!

12:40.160 --> 12:42.494
Okay. Sorry!

12:42.562 --> 12:44.495
[sighing] You were
already the bad kid!

12:44.564 --> 12:47.298
The first time Mom found porn
she asked me if they were yours.

12:47.366 --> 12:49.901
I didn't say no.
Everyone did it.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.670
Wait. Is that why
all the moms
hated me?

12:52.738 --> 12:55.072
Except for Miss Song.
She loves bad boys.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.141
I wanted to tell
my mom the truth.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.010
But the truth is
super complicated.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.311
Because of all the lies?

13:00.379 --> 13:03.147
Huge factor. But the lies
made me look good.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.816
And my mom is
so proud of me.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.851
It's just easier this way.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.419
Easier for you.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.355
Did you even buy me
a toothbrush?

13:10.423 --> 13:12.223
Had trouble landing
on the right colour.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.892
I'm not living a lie
because you hid pot

13:13.960 --> 13:15.359
under your bed
like an amateur.

13:15.362 --> 13:18.029
Why would my mom
look in a box hidden
under my bed?

13:18.097 --> 13:19.463
Are you hearing yourself?

13:19.532 --> 13:21.532
She's only here one more day.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.234
She's had such a great time.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.203
Do you really want
to take that away from her?

13:25.672 --> 13:26.737
One more day.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.708
So, would you have buried
the pot in the backyard

13:30.776 --> 13:32.677
or the suitcase with
false-bottom situation?

13:35.448 --> 13:36.914
[Frank] "To whom
it may concern..."

13:36.917 --> 13:38.883
Hmm. Sounds serious.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.219
Hmm. I've been on
the receiving end
of a few of those. Hmm.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.188
What's the difference
between who and whom?

13:44.257 --> 13:45.423
It's like he and him.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.293
Would you say it may be
a concern to he?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.961
Maybe. Does he have a problem?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.395
Who?

13:51.464 --> 13:52.796
Whoever you talking about.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.933
No, no, no. The word
"whom" is like "him"
and "who" is like "he".

13:55.936 --> 13:57.735
And he is whoever
you talking about.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.938
And him is whomever
you're talking about.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.741
Wow. This is
a doozy of a letter.

14:03.809 --> 14:05.343
Oh. So you think
my English is okay.

14:05.411 --> 14:08.212
I do? I see you're asking.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.282
Ah, just a little typo here
before "recommend."

14:11.350 --> 14:13.685
-"Definitely not" is two words.
-Yeah. Okay.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.152
And just a personal preference,

14:15.155 --> 14:18.022
but the term "sweety"
might be a little informal.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.957
Oh. Is supposed to be sweaty.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.759
Ah! That makes more sense.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.161
And to my eye,
lazy's probably fine
all by itself.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.964
You don't need all the verys
and underlines and caps.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.833
Well, everyone have
their own style.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.636
[clears throat] Yeah.
How you spell sincerely?

14:32.505 --> 14:34.839
S-I-N-C-E-R-E-L-Y.

14:34.841 --> 14:38.142
Don't mean to brag, but I'm
a three-time spelling bee
champion's ex- husband.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.711
Just clean up a few typos,

14:39.779 --> 14:42.480
you got yourself
a heck of a hack-job
on this Gerald kid.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.648
Okay. Thank you, Frank.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.391
I think we have enough sign.

14:53.459 --> 14:57.028
I find good marker,
so I decide to change,
make more upscale.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.830
Sound like a lots of work.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.932
Easy for me.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.734
Yeah. Yeah.

15:02.802 --> 15:06.470
Oh, Gerald! What you want?
I already give you letter.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.005
I wanted to thank you in person.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.007
So, thank you.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.608
It's a great letter.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.876
Okay.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.679
I mean, it's very honest,
which I'm not exactly used to.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.881
So, uh... not too many mistake?

15:16.950 --> 15:19.617
None that I could see.
It was excellent.

15:19.619 --> 15:23.688
Ah. So glad to hear is
a very, very excellent letter

15:23.690 --> 15:25.623
with no mistake.

15:25.691 --> 15:29.327
And it felt good
to hear how
you feel about me.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.629
It felt good
to write down.

15:31.698 --> 15:35.333
I never thought of myself
as capable. Or inspiring.

15:35.401 --> 15:36.834
I not say those thing.

15:36.902 --> 15:40.004
I know. You wrote them,
which is even nicer.

15:40.072 --> 15:41.039
Ah. Give to me.

15:43.109 --> 15:48.145
"Gerald is the most
qualified photographer
and best employee

15:48.214 --> 15:51.215
His work ethic is matched
only by his

15:51.217 --> 15:53.952
co... Collab...
Collaborative soul."

15:55.121 --> 15:57.989
Hearing you read it
is even more powerful.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.057
Where you get this?

16:00.026 --> 16:01.392
You gave it to me.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.394
Well, Janet gave it
to me for you.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.063
-Sneak attack.
-What?

16:05.131 --> 16:07.632
Here.
Janet doing like that, hmm?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.001
I give to her this letter.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.570
"Gerald is never on time...

16:12.572 --> 16:14.872
Has trouble with even
most simple instruction.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.240
Yawn too much."

16:16.308 --> 16:20.845
Well, um, this one is...
More honest.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.219
Oh. Hello, Janet.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.222
Gerald and I just
having tea and hang out.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.289
Uh-huh.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.824
Do join us, Janet.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.093
Yes, do.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.828
I just sitting here
and charge phone

16:37.831 --> 16:40.431
and you take best chair.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.802
And I think we all know
why I sat here.

16:44.871 --> 16:48.906
I don't want to interrupt
your... Whatever this is.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.875
Come. We celebrate!

16:50.877 --> 16:53.611
Gerald sending in
a big application package.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.747
Yeah, Janet.
For the internship
I was shortlisted for.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.316
You were shortlisted
for an internship?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.853
Well, yeah. The, um,

17:01.921 --> 17:02.953
the one... The one that...
That--

17:02.956 --> 17:04.455
Obviously, I know
what you're talking about.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.257
Well, then, you'll be glad
to know that we included

17:06.325 --> 17:07.925
the reference letter
written by your dad.

17:07.993 --> 17:09.894
We definitely wanted
to include that.

17:09.962 --> 17:10.961
The one I gave you?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.197
Yeah. The one I gave you.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.765
'Cause Janet
gave me your letter.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.934
As long as
it's the one
I gave you.

17:16.936 --> 17:20.471
I think we can all agree
that we sent in the letter
that Mr. Kim wrote.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.039
-The one I gave you?
-[Kim] Janet,

17:22.108 --> 17:23.274
we know you sneak attack!

17:23.342 --> 17:24.408
Yeah, Janet.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.177
And now we sneak attack you!

17:26.245 --> 17:28.346
Yeah. By sending
your dad's
original letter.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.181
Hmm.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.283
Well, that's one way
to guarantee you don't
land the internship.

17:32.351 --> 17:33.851
Or get hired. Ever.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.253
Well, that's a pretty
small price to pay to have
out-meddled you, okay?

17:36.256 --> 17:39.090
The puppet
has now become
the marionette.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.825
You is just like you Umma.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.494
I am not like Umma.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.664
Sneak attack
disguise as help
actual way to control.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.933
Yeah! And you can't control me
anymore, Janet, okay?

17:48.935 --> 17:50.835
See? My strings have been cut.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.837
[jellybeans clattering]

17:52.905 --> 17:53.938
Uh...

17:54.006 --> 17:57.108
See? I say he's clumsy
in a letter.

17:57.176 --> 18:01.312
Well, actions speak
louder than words. Hmm.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.013
[door slams]

18:03.082 --> 18:04.315
[woman] How's
the rest of your day?

18:04.383 --> 18:05.483
Pretty crazy.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.052
I mean, Jung Kim.
Out of the blue, right?

18:08.121 --> 18:10.020
Well, you used to be close.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.989
Yeah, and I figured
I might be able
to help him out.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.124
Wow.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.325
Yeah. Guy's been
down on his luck

18:14.393 --> 18:16.627
and I figure
my rent's pretty high

18:16.695 --> 18:18.529
and he's been living
in a car, so...

18:18.932 --> 18:20.131
So generous.

18:20.834 --> 18:21.966
I got it from my mom.

18:22.735 --> 18:26.170
And... You've run into Jung

18:27.140 --> 18:28.873
quite a few times
over the years.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.076
Angie, I find more photo
under Jung's bed.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.344
Mostly naked girl

18:33.412 --> 18:35.746
but Kimchee is there, too.
Hi, Kimchee!

18:35.814 --> 18:38.349
I put food in freezer
for you and Jung.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.217
Young-mi and I were
just catching up, too.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.319
-[door opens]
-Oh.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.488
Hey, Kimch. Oh, wow.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.856
What a great place.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.659
But, hey, anything off
the street is a step up
for me, right?

18:50.229 --> 18:51.695
Oh, my God.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.697
My umma's your
cleaning lady? Huh!

18:53.766 --> 18:54.765
It's like this was meant to be.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.333
Stop. Both of you.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.202
They found my party box.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.437
And all your naked picture.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.540
-What?
-Yeah, under your bed.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.709
Oh. Naked pictures
of other people.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.845
[sighs] So, I guess you know
all those terrible things
Jung did,

19:07.914 --> 19:09.313
he didn't really do.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.916
-Some weird kid
who died in a fire did.
-Kimchee!

19:11.918 --> 19:14.518
I know. It was me. I'm sorry.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.855
It's just that I figured
I'd disappointed you enough.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.323
I didn't want to make it worse.

19:19.325 --> 19:23.060
So, Jung didn't force
you to get an eyebrow ring
in Grade 9?

19:23.128 --> 19:25.196
I was trying to look
badass for Mrs. Song.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.731
Oh, yeah, Mrs. Song!

19:26.799 --> 19:28.032
She is a worst umma.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.868
Always coming over and smoking
her cigarette behind my store

19:30.870 --> 19:32.236
making it look like me.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.340
Oh. Can you believe?
Such a dirty habit.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.541
I know.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.076
And she used
to come over
to my house

19:39.078 --> 19:42.246
and leave all these
strange men's clothes
in my bed.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.815
So weird.

19:44.883 --> 19:47.117
Mrs. Song is very bad lady.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.119
Worst umma ever.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.955
I don't know.
She always likes
my selfies.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.624
Likes?

19:59.098 --> 20:02.466
Oh, Mrs. Ada.
Bouillon cube
still have discount.

20:02.534 --> 20:03.868
I see that.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.903
And your signs are
much improved!

20:05.971 --> 20:07.070
Yeah?

20:07.140 --> 20:11.242
Before you had
the apostrophe
incorrectly placed.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.644
I was telling Mrs. Kim
I take English lessons.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.412
Top of class.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.647
Uh-huh.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.315
Anyway, good work.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.483
[tinkling door chimes]

20:19.551 --> 20:22.186
-Oh, Mrs. Ada! How you doing?
-Good.

20:22.255 --> 20:25.122
She just tell me
how my sign have
no mistake.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.191
Oh, yeah. Good.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.227
Because Mrs. Ada help.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.128
Oh, yeah. Good.

20:31.196 --> 20:32.830
Well, I should get going.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.165
Class is in 15 minutes.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.668
Today is conjunctions

20:37.670 --> 20:40.170
AND I want to be on time

20:40.239 --> 20:42.273
BUT the bus might be late

20:42.275 --> 20:44.842
OR I might walk. YET--

20:44.910 --> 20:45.876
-Just go.
-Okay.

20:50.482 --> 20:51.582
-[door opens]
-[tinkling door chimes]

20:51.950 --> 20:53.183
Hey.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.486
Delightful afternoon, Janet.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.888
Oh, you look
exceptionally
jaunty today.

20:59.692 --> 21:00.791
What's going on?

21:00.859 --> 21:04.728
Yeah, we just decide
to ameliorate
our vocabulary.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.298
You probably flabbergast
right now.

21:07.366 --> 21:10.267
Yah! Because you speak
only one language.

21:10.336 --> 21:11.635
But we master two.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.904
Yah. Keep up, Janet.

21:13.972 --> 21:15.639
Oh! I know good word
for you, Janet.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.808
Ah... Unilingual.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.143
Or in Korean...

21:23.049 --> 21:25.016
