WEBVTT

00:18.745 --> 00:21.548
: Ambush,
ambush! Checkpoint Danny Boy.

00:22.551 --> 00:24.848
Outnumbered. Two men down.
Request backup.

00:24.883 --> 00:26.421
:
Received. Backup deployed.

00:26.456 --> 00:27.752
Three Warriors.

00:27.787 --> 00:29.622
: Heavy incoming!
- : Whisky 2-2

00:29.657 --> 00:31.096
five minutes away.

00:36.895 --> 00:38.301
:
This is Whisky 2-2

00:38.336 --> 00:39.566
approaching
Checkpoint Danny Boy.

00:39.601 --> 00:41.337
RPG and gunshot incoming.

00:41.372 --> 00:43.735
I don't like it.
- Just sit tight, mate, OK?

00:43.770 --> 00:45.143
You're gonna be alright.

00:47.741 --> 00:50.445
: Woody, listen up.
Enemy are dug in.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.348
Your orders
are to leave the vehicle.

00:52.383 --> 00:55.252
Sorry, say again, Stick. You
want us to dismount into that?

00:55.287 --> 00:57.089
They've got two men down.
They need help.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.387
So prep the boys for dismount.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.192
What's he saying?

01:06.892 --> 01:09.266
We're gonna dismount
and close with the enemy.

01:09.301 --> 01:11.169
:
What, here? Just us?

01:12.766 --> 01:14.832
After me.
Be quick about it, yeah?

01:32.258 --> 01:34.357
: How does it feel
to be accused of war crimes?

01:34.392 --> 01:35.193
It's Brian Wood.

01:37.329 --> 01:39.362
-

01:46.173 --> 01:48.437
: A boy at school
says you're a murderer.

01:48.472 --> 01:50.175
:
And that's what's upsetting you?

01:50.210 --> 01:51.308
That is upsetting.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.545
Come here, little man.

02:00.385 --> 02:03.188
Say you're not.
- Not what?

02:03.223 --> 02:04.156
Dad.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.488
Bailey...

02:08.195 --> 02:09.590
do I look like a murderer
to you?

02:10.725 --> 02:14.529
The inquiry's terms of reference
are as follows, and I quote:

02:14.729 --> 02:17.532
"To investigate and report
on the allegations made

02:17.567 --> 02:20.172
by the claimants against
British soldiers

02:20.207 --> 02:24.275
on the 14th and 15th
of May 2004."

02:24.310 --> 02:28.279
Corporal Wood, do you understand
how matters will proceed?

02:30.008 --> 02:32.382
I do, sir, yes.

02:43.659 --> 02:45.263
:
OK, lads, you're on your own.

02:45.298 --> 02:46.561
You ready for this?

02:46.959 --> 02:48.893
Rushy, you ready for this?
- Yes!

02:48.928 --> 02:50.928
Spud? Let's do this! Go, go, go!

03:07.881 --> 03:10.354
Ah, Jesus, babe.

03:13.623 --> 03:15.887
Do you ever get that thing,
you wake up

03:15.922 --> 03:17.724
and you haven't
got a bloody clue where you are?

03:18.826 --> 03:20.331
No.

03:26.603 --> 03:28.273
Want me to tell you
where you are?

03:28.935 --> 03:30.242
I know now.

03:31.773 --> 03:32.838
Want me to tell you?

03:34.941 --> 03:35.841
:
Yeah, go on, then.

03:37.713 --> 03:40.285
You are in London.
- Yeah?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.947
To meet the Queen.

03:43.719 --> 03:45.389
And why's that then?

03:45.424 --> 03:48.755
Because you're a hero and she
wants to pin something on you.

04:01.473 --> 04:03.440
: Come on, wee man,
come on. Let's go find your mum.

04:03.475 --> 04:05.310
- Here we go, come on.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.246
She's in there. Go and see her.
On you go, son.

04:07.776 --> 04:10.381
Ho-ho!
Look at this smart wee laddie.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.647
:
Wahey! Alright, Bailey boy?

04:12.682 --> 04:14.550
How did you like spending
the night with Nana and Grandad?

04:14.585 --> 04:16.750
Hello!
- He wants to see his mum.

04:16.785 --> 04:18.686
Did you forget your kecks?
- Is that a problem?

04:18.721 --> 04:21.689
He's got great legs.
Look at my lovely boy!

04:21.724 --> 04:24.054
He's our lovely boy.
- Are you our lovely boy?

04:24.089 --> 04:26.496
Are you our lovely boy?
- Are you two not ready yet?

04:26.531 --> 04:28.399
Do you know what time it is?
- : Er, tranquillo.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.763
Dad, be honest,
is this tie straight?

04:29.798 --> 04:31.468
It's straight.
Come on, get a move on.

04:31.503 --> 04:33.569
Don't muss him all up, you. Took
me forever getting him dressed.

04:33.604 --> 04:35.098
You might have
to do the same for Brian.

04:35.133 --> 04:36.935
Wouldn't be the first time.
Give that here

04:36.970 --> 04:39.707
and get your trousers on.
- Right, that's it. Chop chop.

04:39.742 --> 04:42.314
I'm putting you two
on the clock. T-minus ten.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.495
:
23 years in the Army, son.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.090
It never took me
to places like this.

05:13.809 --> 05:16.975
: On the 14th of May 2004,
Lance Corporal Brian Wood

05:17.010 --> 05:18.746
was sent to the aid of comrades

05:18.781 --> 05:21.551
ambushed under enemy fire
at Checkpoint Danny Boy.

05:22.785 --> 05:24.081
In recognition
of his leadership

05:24.116 --> 05:25.687
courage and selfless action

05:25.722 --> 05:28.052
during some of
the fiercest fighting in Iraq

05:28.087 --> 05:31.330
Lance Corporal Wood receives the
Military Cross for gallantry.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.863
:
Come on, Brian. Keep up.

05:36.898 --> 05:39.734
: He does know other
stuff, but mainly he's keepers.

05:39.769 --> 05:41.736
: Don't tell me they
have a coach just for goalies.

05:41.771 --> 05:43.738
: Anyway, he asked me
to be the one taking penalties

05:43.773 --> 05:45.773
for the goalies to have
penalty-taking practice

05:45.808 --> 05:47.709
cos he said they can never
tell where I was gonna go

05:47.744 --> 05:49.711
and also I could put it
where I wanted it to go.

05:49.746 --> 05:51.713
Whereas a lot of the
other kids just froze up

05:51.748 --> 05:53.616
when it came to spot kicks,
or looked at the keepers

05:53.651 --> 05:55.387
and lost their concentration.
And he said--

05:55.422 --> 05:58.390
OK, OK, Brian.
- "Keep it brief."

05:58.425 --> 05:59.820
:
Keep it brief.

06:00.592 --> 06:02.592
So, you wanted
to come out running.

06:02.627 --> 06:05.023
Let's see what you're made of.
- Yeah?

06:05.058 --> 06:06.090
:
Yeah.

06:06.664 --> 06:07.828
Alright.
- Yeah!

06:07.863 --> 06:08.796
Alright!

06:19.446 --> 06:20.841
:
It begins with R, Brian!

06:25.012 --> 06:26.616
Resilience.

06:28.917 --> 06:30.081
Dad!

06:51.775 --> 06:53.775
: Alright, Woody?
Where's your medal?

07:21.574 --> 07:22.870
:
Sir, what's it like

07:22.905 --> 07:25.070
jumping out of a Warrior
under fire?

07:25.105 --> 07:26.874
That's a good question.

07:26.909 --> 07:29.239
It's, er, Johnno, right?
- Sir.

07:31.749 --> 07:33.144
Johnno,
I'm here today to tell you

07:33.179 --> 07:34.519
all about the realities of war.

07:37.524 --> 07:40.283
And maybe one of the realities
of war is it's not so easy

07:40.318 --> 07:41.724
to stand up and talk about it.

07:44.894 --> 07:46.256
And you're gonna
have guys out there

07:46.291 --> 07:48.258
who are making a big song
and dance about what they did

07:48.293 --> 07:49.666
getting their
names in the paper.

07:49.701 --> 07:50.997
Good luck to them.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.933
I'll let you make your
own judgment about that.

07:52.968 --> 07:54.231
I've got nothing
to say about that.

07:56.708 --> 07:58.235
You know what I was focusing on?

08:00.173 --> 08:02.679
Eh? Anyone?

08:04.342 --> 08:06.617
I wasn't thinking
about being brave

08:06.652 --> 08:09.213
being a hero,
or winning medals.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.589
I was focusing
on destroying the enemy

08:11.624 --> 08:13.591
and keeping myself
and my men alive.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.023
I was fighting my own fight.

08:18.026 --> 08:20.290
I wasn't worried about
what everybody else was doing.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.666
Alright? That's a sure-fire
way to get yourself--

08:22.701 --> 08:24.668
- Corporal Wood?

08:26.199 --> 08:27.605
Yeah?

08:34.273 --> 08:36.713
Spencer.
HE CLEARS THROAT

08:47.286 --> 08:49.121
I'm teaching. What's this about?

08:49.893 --> 08:51.189
We just want
a little chat with you.

08:51.224 --> 08:52.630
A little chat?

08:53.391 --> 08:55.765
Congratulations
on the medal, Corporal.

08:55.965 --> 08:57.569
Are you gonna tell me
what this is about?

08:58.330 --> 08:59.802
We will, yeah.

09:10.309 --> 09:13.750
You just take a seat here
for me, please, Corporal Wood.

09:16.018 --> 09:18.084
We're gonna show you photos,
Corporal

09:18.119 --> 09:21.758
from the Battle of Danny Boy,
from its aftermath.

09:21.793 --> 09:23.826
You tell us if you
recognise anyone in them.

09:25.291 --> 09:26.565
OK?

09:42.044 --> 09:43.109
And this one?

09:46.686 --> 09:48.081
What's this about?

09:48.116 --> 09:51.018
Just whether you know
who these people are, Corporal.

09:51.053 --> 09:52.085
No.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.096
That's my unit.

10:05.331 --> 10:06.363
:
Him?

10:08.972 --> 10:10.873
Do you recognise this detainee,
Corporal Wood?

10:16.045 --> 10:17.143
Yeah, I, um...

10:18.344 --> 10:19.783
I took him prisoner.

10:19.818 --> 10:21.015
And what was
the manner of that?

10:23.481 --> 10:26.185
Do you recall the rules of
engagement, Corporal Wood?

10:29.421 --> 10:32.290
Yes.
- So you took this man prisoner.

10:35.229 --> 10:38.263
Tell me about the use of force.
- He gave himself up.

10:38.298 --> 10:39.737
He was armed?

10:40.839 --> 10:43.004
Was he just a man
in a field, or...?

10:43.039 --> 10:44.808
No, he was armed.

10:44.843 --> 10:46.711
The CSM shouted,
"Drop your weapons," and he did.

10:46.746 --> 10:47.877
The CSM just shouted--

10:47.912 --> 10:49.747
"Drop your fucking weapons,"
yeah.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.345
You'd drop 'em, wouldn't you?

10:54.754 --> 10:56.413
You met the CSM.

10:56.855 --> 10:58.888
Was he barefoot
when you took him prisoner?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.928
Yeah.
- Did you plasticuff him?

11:07.096 --> 11:09.899
No, no, not at the time, no.
- Did you offer him water?

11:13.267 --> 11:15.003
Not that I recall.

11:15.038 --> 11:16.807
I'd have thought that date
was printed on your memory.

11:20.879 --> 11:21.977
It is.

11:27.215 --> 11:29.050
So, did you offer him water...

11:31.054 --> 11:32.317
Corporal Wood?

11:36.026 --> 11:37.355
Did you?

11:39.766 --> 11:41.293
Did you offer him water?
- Corporal Wood--

11:41.328 --> 11:42.701
Or were you not there?

11:56.409 --> 11:59.377
Sorry, say again, Stick. You
want us to dismount into that?

11:59.412 --> 12:01.753
: They've got two
men down. They need help.

12:01.788 --> 12:02.820
Prep the boys for dismount.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.187
OK, lads. You're on your own.

12:07.222 --> 12:08.859
You ready for this?
-

12:08.894 --> 12:10.795
Rushy, you ready for this?
- Yes.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.094
Spud? Let's do this! Go, go, go!

12:33.545 --> 12:35.578
: Enemy, bridge line.
We close with the enemy

12:35.613 --> 12:37.283
we take position one, yeah?

12:37.318 --> 12:39.120
:
But that's 120 metres away!

12:41.421 --> 12:42.486
Right, he's firing us in!

12:42.521 --> 12:45.324
Five, four, three,

12:45.997 --> 12:47.227
two, one!

12:53.004 --> 12:53.970
On me!

12:57.844 --> 12:58.810
50 metres!

13:03.949 --> 13:05.080
:
Go, go, go!

13:10.450 --> 13:12.824
Get your hands up now!

13:13.420 --> 13:15.090
On the ground now!

13:15.125 --> 13:18.027
Get the fuck on the ground now!
You fucking... Shut the fuck up!

13:22.033 --> 13:23.232
:
Where'd the rest of them go?

13:23.268 --> 13:25.034
: They could be back
any minute. Get the cuffs on.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.468
Position one.
Not a scratch on us, boys.

13:30.503 --> 13:32.338
British fighting spirit
done that, mate.

13:32.373 --> 13:34.076
Here we go, lads. Get in.

13:51.491 --> 13:54.228
Wait there, wait there.
I'll be right down.

14:00.533 --> 14:01.873
Morning.

14:02.337 --> 14:04.271
Put this intercom
and security in

14:04.306 --> 14:05.976
because of all
the threats against us.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.571
It doesn't work properly

14:08.112 --> 14:11.047
so I spend all my time running
up and down these stairs.

14:11.544 --> 14:13.511
It won't be the nutjobs
that kill me.

14:13.546 --> 14:15.117
It'll be the exhaustion.

14:15.152 --> 14:17.185
Thanks for coming
up to the office to see me.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.550
It'll give you a chance to see
the job the way it really is.

14:20.091 --> 14:21.585
Of course, I'm too bloody busy

14:21.620 --> 14:23.895
to get up to the university
at the moment.

14:25.558 --> 14:28.262
Some of you will end up
in big fuck-off law practices

14:28.297 --> 14:31.265
in the City with smoked glass
and neck massages

14:31.300 --> 14:34.268
but the vast majority
of lawyers work like this.

14:34.303 --> 14:36.270
You'll need to get
your brains around that.

14:36.305 --> 14:38.371
Right, straight through,
in here, come on.

14:39.605 --> 14:42.573
My advice is go running

14:43.543 --> 14:46.951
do yoga, start flower-arranging.

14:47.382 --> 14:49.954
Anything to give you
a sense of perspective.

14:51.254 --> 14:52.418
This job will eat you up

14:52.453 --> 14:54.189
and spit you out
if you're not careful.

14:54.224 --> 14:55.553
Who wants tea?
- Me.

14:55.588 --> 14:57.588
Ah. What's your name?

14:57.623 --> 14:59.095
Deena.
- Sugar?

14:59.460 --> 15:00.558
Two, please.
- Ah.

15:01.495 --> 15:03.495
Oh, shit. There is none.

15:04.399 --> 15:09.369
Er, right. So, you want
to be human rights lawyers.

15:09.767 --> 15:12.537
What's the first quality
you're going to need? Hm?

15:14.145 --> 15:16.046
Got some sachets here somewhere.

15:16.510 --> 15:17.949
Come on, I won't bite.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.116
Compassion?
- Compassion? OK.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.085
Anything else?

15:23.385 --> 15:25.055
Empathy?
- A thick skin.

15:25.486 --> 15:27.552
You're going to need
a thick skin.

15:27.587 --> 15:29.257
And why do I say that, Deena?

15:29.292 --> 15:30.720
Because some of the things
we might be doing--

15:30.755 --> 15:33.228
Because people will tear you up.

15:33.263 --> 15:36.132
Politicians, the press,
the establishment.

15:36.629 --> 15:39.971
It doesn't matter
how clear it is to you

15:40.006 --> 15:41.698
that human rights are sacrosanct

15:41.733 --> 15:43.535
and you have a duty
to protect them

15:43.570 --> 15:45.042
whoever's they might be.

15:46.210 --> 15:48.309
Other people
will tell you different.

15:48.344 --> 15:50.212
They'll tell you
you're a bleeding heart

15:50.247 --> 15:51.378
they'll tell you you're naive

15:51.413 --> 15:53.116
they'll tell you
you're money-grubbing.

15:53.151 --> 15:55.118
Why do they say those things?

15:55.153 --> 15:56.746
Hm? Mush?
Why do they say those things?

15:58.090 --> 16:00.222
Who? The--
- Because now and then

16:00.257 --> 16:02.026
you're going
to have to tell them things

16:02.061 --> 16:04.061
they really don't want to hear.

16:05.328 --> 16:06.591
And here's one of them.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.595
British soldiers
get away with murder.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.237
Who's heard of Baha Mousa?

16:14.403 --> 16:18.306
Couple of years ago, Iraqi lad,
worked in a hotel in Basra.

16:18.539 --> 16:20.473
About the same age as you lot.
He's, uh...

16:21.839 --> 16:25.016
He's a father of two kids
aged two and four.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.315
He's dead, right?
- He is now, yes.

16:27.713 --> 16:29.317
Brace yourselves.

16:30.221 --> 16:34.058
That's him after a period
at Her Majesty's pleasure.

16:36.557 --> 16:40.823
So, on behalf of his family,
I respectfully argued in court

16:40.858 --> 16:44.233
that Baha Mousa,
in British custody in Iraq

16:44.268 --> 16:46.664
had the same human rights
as any other prisoner

16:46.699 --> 16:49.271
in any other British jail.

16:49.306 --> 16:52.637
Doesn't matter if it's
in Basra or in Birmingham.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.573
Anyone want to argue with that?

16:54.608 --> 16:56.377
The MOD.
- Ha!

16:56.412 --> 16:58.742
The Ministry of Defence,
very good, they did indeed

16:58.777 --> 17:02.119
because it made their
job much more difficult.

17:02.154 --> 17:05.782
But the High Court and the
Court of Appeal agreed with me.

17:05.817 --> 17:10.160
British law applies wherever
British soldiers have command.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.327
Anybody want to
argue with that principle?

17:13.297 --> 17:14.791
Well, you want
to be human rights lawyers

17:14.826 --> 17:16.265
so I bloody well hope not.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.762
But here's my question.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.733
Tell you what, everyone,
come here. Put your drinks down.

17:22.768 --> 17:25.043
Come round here.
Come on, chop chop.

17:25.606 --> 17:26.605
Over here.

17:27.740 --> 17:28.805
Right.

17:29.643 --> 17:31.247
Here's Baha Mousa.

17:31.678 --> 17:35.713
Face-down in the dirt with
British soldiers all around him

17:35.748 --> 17:38.452
with their SA80s
pointed down at him.

17:38.487 --> 17:42.258
That's you lot, come on.
SA80s pointed down at him.

17:45.527 --> 17:46.526
Now...

17:48.299 --> 17:51.828
we teach our soldiers how
to kill other soldiers in a war

17:51.863 --> 17:53.863
and there's
nothing wrong with that.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.866
But the judge found
that Baha Mousa died

17:56.901 --> 18:00.573
as a result of 93 injuries

18:00.608 --> 18:05.182
incurred over a 36-hour period
in British Army custody.

18:06.779 --> 18:08.482
I proved that case.

18:09.353 --> 18:12.123
But not one soldier
was found guilty of murder

18:12.158 --> 18:14.554
or even manslaughter
or unlawful killing.

18:15.656 --> 18:17.821
Is it right you guys
get away with murder?

18:18.527 --> 18:19.889
Put your guns down.

18:22.894 --> 18:26.830
So how come it's me
that's a disgrace to my country?

18:42.815 --> 18:45.519
Shh!
- Bloody push-ups?

18:45.818 --> 18:47.257
-

19:00.800 --> 19:02.470
Say if I'm
buttering too loud for you.

19:04.804 --> 19:07.871
Brian, I just thought you might
call out to him or something.

19:07.906 --> 19:09.708
I've been up with him
since four.

19:09.743 --> 19:11.446
I, uh...
HE COUGHS

19:12.317 --> 19:14.218
I tried to get up for him
but he didn't want me.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.519
It's gonna take time.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.557
You want him like this,
don't you?

19:25.660 --> 19:26.758
You want him all yours.

19:27.827 --> 19:29.596
I'm not starting all that again.

19:29.631 --> 19:32.236
If it's a problem at work,
let's talk about it.

19:59.463 --> 20:01.661
Who is it?
- Is that Phil Shiner?

20:03.929 --> 20:05.500
Who wants to know?

20:05.535 --> 20:07.502
David Monaghan.
I'm a journalist.

20:07.867 --> 20:08.899
You agreed to meet me.

20:18.075 --> 20:19.250
Did I?

20:21.518 --> 20:22.913
The Battle of Danny Boy.

20:24.818 --> 20:25.850
Right.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.292
Right.

20:30.692 --> 20:34.562
Iraqi farmers, apparently,
at work in their fields

20:35.565 --> 20:37.895
when the Princess of Wales
Regiment happened along.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.637
With Baha Mousa,
you proved a single act

20:43.672 --> 20:46.002
of terrible inhumanity.
This could be 20.

20:47.313 --> 20:48.873
It's not a head count.

20:48.908 --> 20:51.876
Footage of the dead bodies
was filmed by Al Jazeera and...

20:53.451 --> 20:55.715
there's some trophy photos
floating around

20:55.750 --> 20:57.420
taken by British soldiers.

20:58.016 --> 20:59.653
The Red Cross
demanded an inquiry

20:59.688 --> 21:01.622
within days of what happened.

21:01.657 --> 21:03.690
Military Police picked it up
but it's going nowhere.

21:05.122 --> 21:07.364
Loads of inconsistencies
in what they did find.

21:08.895 --> 21:10.026
Something stinks.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.032
Make your programme.
Get it on the screen.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.968
Tell the world.
- I intend to.

21:19.741 --> 21:21.510
So why do you need me?

21:21.545 --> 21:24.073
I don't need you, Phil.
These people might.

21:27.144 --> 21:30.079
Have you got any idea the
amount of work this would take?

21:30.114 --> 21:32.290
How busy I am already?
- Just read it.

21:32.754 --> 21:33.885
What have you got to lose?

21:52.774 --> 21:53.674
Night, Phil.

21:55.007 --> 21:56.380
Night.

22:45.090 --> 22:46.496
Mazin, hi.

22:48.599 --> 22:50.126
Yeah, thanks
for getting back to me.

22:52.834 --> 22:55.406
That's right, that's right.
Listen, I might need you

22:55.441 --> 22:58.409
to go back to Iraq for me.
Something new.

22:58.444 --> 22:59.806
Same arrangement?

23:00.578 --> 23:02.479
Same arrangement
as before, only...

23:03.680 --> 23:05.944
the scale of this thing
could be huge

23:05.979 --> 23:08.749
so I'd need you
to track down witnesses

23:08.784 --> 23:11.081
sound them out,
and I'll meet them in Istanbul.

23:13.624 --> 23:14.623
Right.

23:51.992 --> 23:53.222
:
Babe.

23:53.928 --> 23:54.993
Babe.

23:55.864 --> 23:57.468
He went to sleep. Shh!

23:57.503 --> 23:59.503
:
He went to sleep! Oh!

24:01.804 --> 24:02.869
You're a star.

24:04.103 --> 24:05.608
Come on!

24:05.808 --> 24:07.610
That's the first time
he's went to sleep for me.

24:09.108 --> 24:11.009
:
I mean it, you're a star.

24:11.044 --> 24:13.682
You're getting there with him.
- The sleep master.

24:19.085 --> 24:21.250
What?
- Nothing.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.088
Nothing...
- No, babe, what?

24:28.127 --> 24:29.962
You were like you
used to be just then.

24:30.833 --> 24:32.470
When you came through that door.

24:33.066 --> 24:35.869
Can't we have a happy moment?

24:36.740 --> 24:38.069
I just took my son up to bed.

24:38.104 --> 24:39.642
I got him off to sleep
for the first time.

24:39.677 --> 24:41.512
That's me, I'm being a dad,
I'm being a proper dad.

24:42.075 --> 24:43.877
I am happy.

24:43.912 --> 24:44.845
You don't look happy.

24:47.179 --> 24:48.849
I was at the doctor today

24:48.884 --> 24:50.950
getting a prescription
for sleeping pills.

24:51.315 --> 24:54.085
Every other night, you're waking
up not knowing where you are.

24:54.989 --> 24:57.858
Yeah, well, no doubt about
where I am before I'm waking up.

24:58.190 --> 24:59.926
OK.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.897
Come on. Let's talk about that.

25:06.066 --> 25:07.769
What's going on, Brian?

25:09.069 --> 25:11.168
You really think, don't you

25:11.203 --> 25:14.237
that if you don't say anything's
wrong then nothing's wrong?

25:30.288 --> 25:31.760
I feel like you
don't want me home.

25:33.599 --> 25:34.290
OK?

25:38.131 --> 25:40.670
And I feel like every
fucking thing I do is wrong.

26:12.297 --> 26:13.934
I don't know
any more than you do.

26:24.144 --> 26:25.110
Ho!

26:26.344 --> 26:27.783
We going
on this run, or what?

26:56.473 --> 26:58.044
I thought we
were running together.

27:01.412 --> 27:04.787
Fifteen years retired, I am.
- Not whingeing, are we?

27:06.791 --> 27:08.890
It wasn't cruelty
I was teaching you, Brian.

27:09.992 --> 27:12.388
It was resilience.
- Yeah, I know that, Dad.

27:13.226 --> 27:14.764
I got that. You did that.

27:19.804 --> 27:20.737
Look, son...

27:22.070 --> 27:23.366
Your mother's worried about you.

27:24.468 --> 27:25.973
Is everything OK
with you and Lucy?

27:27.438 --> 27:29.273
Yeah. No, it's, um...

27:30.749 --> 27:33.849
You know,
one minute I was in Al Amara

27:33.884 --> 27:36.181
and the next minute
I was going in through the door

27:36.216 --> 27:39.085
and seeing my baby boy
for the first time, so...

27:39.285 --> 27:40.724
You know, it's gonna, um...

27:42.959 --> 27:44.662
You know, it's gonna be a...

27:55.202 --> 27:56.399
You never killed anybody.

27:58.139 --> 27:59.336
No.

28:03.276 --> 28:04.748
It never fell to me to do it.

28:06.147 --> 28:07.113
But if it had, I woulda.

28:08.215 --> 28:10.985
Mind you, it was Northern
Ireland, it's different.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.789
You couldnae tell who
was friend, who was foe.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.516
And it's Northern Ireland.

28:14.551 --> 28:16.793
They're our own people,
it's the UK.

28:16.828 --> 28:19.829
You know, I trained for it,
and I did it and it works

28:20.766 --> 28:22.095
and you think...

28:22.361 --> 28:25.494
"Fuck," you know,
"I'm alive and he's dead."

28:26.464 --> 28:27.969
And then after...

28:35.176 --> 28:37.044
You know we're
here for you, right?

28:37.882 --> 28:40.817
Yeah. Then the RMP
come knocking on your door--

28:40.852 --> 28:43.314
The RMP? Are you kidding?

28:43.349 --> 28:45.756
A decorated war hero?
Tell 'em to piss off!

28:45.791 --> 28:48.759
You can't just tell them... They
get your head in a spin, Dad.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.057
You start thinking what you did

28:50.092 --> 28:53.093
or didn't--
- You did a good job, son.

28:53.799 --> 28:54.864
That's what you did.

28:56.131 --> 28:57.328
Hey.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.332
For 300 years

29:01.906 --> 29:03.400
this family served this country.

29:04.337 --> 29:05.743
Twelve generations.

29:06.372 --> 29:07.470
Those guys...

29:08.946 --> 29:10.407
they're right here with us.

29:16.019 --> 29:16.886
OK.

29:20.353 --> 29:21.385
Brian?

29:22.554 --> 29:25.257
Aye, he's alright. Just
doesnae like losing, that's all.

29:25.292 --> 29:26.797
He's not the only one.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.491
:
Come on. In we go.

29:37.502 --> 29:39.139
...your fucking mouth, mate!

29:39.174 --> 29:41.779
Shut your mouth!
- I tell you right now, mate.

29:45.543 --> 29:46.817
Get a blindfold on him!

29:49.151 --> 29:50.414
Where'd the rest of them go?

29:50.449 --> 29:52.119
They could be back any minute.
Get your cuffs on.

29:52.154 --> 29:53.153
Blindfolds! Blindfolds!

29:54.387 --> 29:56.387
- Are we good?

29:57.159 --> 29:59.060
Everyone OK?
- All good.

30:00.426 --> 30:03.262
Boys, keep your heads down.
Remember, two-way range.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.499
Is the battlefield clear?
- No, sir.

30:10.172 --> 30:11.105
No.

30:13.010 --> 30:16.110
Right. Leave this shower
to your men. You come with me.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.101
:
Woody, walk on!

31:36.060 --> 31:38.423
We're over-committed.
Woody, back this way, come on.

31:39.998 --> 31:41.393
Drop your fucking weapons!

31:41.428 --> 31:44.000
- Put your fucking hands up now!

31:44.266 --> 31:45.232
Now! Here!

31:46.235 --> 31:47.663
Hands up! Get your hands up
right now! To me.

31:49.271 --> 31:51.073
You.
- Arms.

31:54.012 --> 31:55.638
He's good. To me now.
- Come here.

31:55.673 --> 31:57.574
To me. Do you speak English?

31:58.148 --> 31:59.048
Stay there.

32:02.053 --> 32:03.448
He's clean.

32:03.483 --> 32:05.285
Move, now!
- Go!

32:07.058 --> 32:08.321
Why didn't they shoot us?

32:10.655 --> 32:13.656
Hey! Why didn't you shoot us?
We never even saw you.

32:16.298 --> 32:17.528
What kind of soldiers are you?

32:22.601 --> 32:23.974
Go, go!

32:25.043 --> 32:26.977
Keep going!
-

32:27.012 --> 32:28.077
Lose our lives
over a flip-flop?

32:29.212 --> 32:31.949
Lose this again,
I'm throwing it!

32:36.516 --> 32:39.088
Go! Go!
-

32:40.157 --> 32:41.519
Yeah, in English, mate.

32:41.554 --> 32:43.455
Farmer!
- Farmer?

32:43.490 --> 32:45.127
He's a farmer?

32:45.162 --> 32:46.755
You're farmers,
I'm a fucking Brigadier, mate.

32:48.165 --> 32:49.428
How old are you?

32:49.760 --> 32:52.332
- Stay there.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.303
16!

32:56.668 --> 32:57.700
:
Stay there!

32:58.175 --> 32:59.438
Get a move on.
- Go.

33:01.310 --> 33:02.474
Go.

33:35.740 --> 33:38.576
:

33:56.893 --> 34:00.466
:

34:00.501 --> 34:01.830
Has he had his expenses?

34:02.536 --> 34:04.536
:

34:06.672 --> 34:08.078
His mother has.

34:08.113 --> 34:11.609
Istanbul interviews, day two.
Time, 9:30am.

34:17.683 --> 34:21.487
He was face-down in the ditch.
He could hear soldiers coming.

34:21.819 --> 34:26.393
Take him back to the beginning.
Family set-up and all that.

34:28.628 --> 34:30.661
Mother and sister hated Saddam

34:30.696 --> 34:33.334
because Saddam
killed their uncle and cousin.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.700
All family happy to see
British soldiers when they came.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.405
Friends bringing freedom.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.210
Does he work? School?

34:56.161 --> 34:58.524
School in the mornings,
farm in the afternoons.

34:58.559 --> 35:01.098
That day he had to cut
fresh grass for his cow.

35:01.958 --> 35:03.562
Did he have a gun with him?

35:13.772 --> 35:17.213
For wolves, for bandits.
Kalashnikov.

35:19.679 --> 35:23.252
Er, Iraqi men in black clothes
with guns got out of trucks

35:23.287 --> 35:24.946
and spread in the field
near the farm.

35:29.392 --> 35:31.623
: And when the British
came past, there was shooting

35:31.658 --> 35:33.856
and he lay down in the ditch,
facing the ditch.

35:40.403 --> 35:43.635
He was bleeding, crying,
asking them, "Please, stop."

35:43.670 --> 35:46.176
They drag him a long, long way

35:46.211 --> 35:48.409
throw him in the vehicle
with dead bodies.

35:49.940 --> 35:50.939
And...

35:52.349 --> 35:53.942
what... what happened
to his weapon?

36:01.787 --> 36:03.226
He didn't have weapon.

36:05.758 --> 36:08.495
He said just now he did.
A Kalashnikov?

36:12.996 --> 36:14.831
He had weapon but only at home.

36:16.604 --> 36:19.374
I need to know whether he was
carrying the weapon that day.

36:20.872 --> 36:25.413
Hm? Ask him, because in
his previous statement, here...

36:31.014 --> 36:32.948
:
Here. He said he had it.

36:32.983 --> 36:35.720
Now, if he's gonna
chop and change

36:35.755 --> 36:37.557
he'll be no good to me
in the witness box.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.826
:
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.866
-

36:50.671 --> 36:52.033
What's he saying?

36:52.068 --> 36:53.870
He says he's been waiting
two hours and he needs to eat.

36:53.905 --> 36:56.004
Oh, does he need money for food?

36:57.040 --> 37:00.481
:

37:00.516 --> 37:02.252
No, he doesn't need money.
I'm telling him

37:02.287 --> 37:05.651
we're not finished with this guy
yet, but he's insisting.

37:05.851 --> 37:07.015
Maybe we are...

37:07.622 --> 37:10.326
Maybe we are finished here.
Thank you.

37:15.465 --> 37:16.695
Thank you. Please.

37:23.770 --> 37:24.967
Please.

37:28.379 --> 37:30.907
And your name is...?
- Hussein.

37:30.942 --> 37:32.249
:
Hussein.

37:34.748 --> 37:36.913
And were you at
the Battle of Danny Boy?

37:37.421 --> 37:39.685
Yes.
- And why were you there?

37:45.121 --> 37:47.022
He is saying that he is--

37:47.057 --> 37:48.661
Not fighter.

37:48.894 --> 37:51.466
I am farmer. Farmer.

37:57.606 --> 37:59.034
: Come on, then.
The guys are out the back.

37:59.069 --> 38:01.509
Hey, you alright?
Yeah! Just go through.

38:01.544 --> 38:02.376
Hi.

38:04.140 --> 38:05.909
:
Nice one, Bailey, keep bouncing!

38:14.590 --> 38:17.492
It's not like you, hanging back
when there's meat on the grill.

38:17.989 --> 38:20.627
Just taking it all in,
you know? A happy family.

38:27.636 --> 38:29.900
Y'know, I'm only here cos
of what two guys did out there.

38:31.376 --> 38:32.903
What, your mates had your back?

38:33.807 --> 38:35.004
It was Iraqis.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.643
Could've killed me, but didn't.

38:38.548 --> 38:40.009
What sort of soldier's that?

38:40.946 --> 38:42.352
What sort of soldier

38:42.387 --> 38:43.749
won't even fire his weapon?
- Brian--

38:43.784 --> 38:45.388
What sort of soldier
wears flipflops and a dishdash?

38:45.423 --> 38:46.323
Brian.

38:48.019 --> 38:49.359
You might only be here

38:49.394 --> 38:50.954
because of those two guys,
but you are here.

38:50.989 --> 38:53.121
No.
- No?

38:53.156 --> 38:54.659
I'm here because
they didn't do what I did.

38:58.568 --> 39:00.095
You said you'd have killed
if you had to.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.838
Well, that's when you decide
who's who.

39:09.007 --> 39:10.512
That moment decides for you.

39:15.453 --> 39:17.013
The dead have
questions for you, Brian.

39:19.490 --> 39:20.753
You need to answer them.

39:28.158 --> 39:29.762
:
Brian!

39:35.803 --> 39:37.132
Deep breaths, babe,
deep breaths.

39:37.167 --> 39:39.068
You're doing great, babe,
you're doing amazing.

39:39.103 --> 39:40.509
Deep breaths, babe, in and out.

39:43.712 --> 39:45.547
I want my mum.
- She's on her way.

39:45.582 --> 39:47.549
I can't do this.
- Yes, you can, babe.

39:47.584 --> 39:48.880
You don't know
what I can and can't do.

39:48.915 --> 39:50.486
I do, babe! I know you.

40:06.097 --> 40:07.965
:
It is our contention

40:08.000 --> 40:11.067
that British soldiers
abused and mistreated Iraqis

40:11.102 --> 40:12.970
on the battlefield at Danny Boy

40:13.005 --> 40:17.007
and afterwards at their base,
at Camp Abu Naji.

40:18.945 --> 40:20.109
More than that...

40:21.378 --> 40:25.180
we believe that many of those
killed, injured or detained...

40:26.755 --> 40:28.183
were not soldiers at all.

40:29.659 --> 40:32.528
There were farmers there,
and innocent bystanders

40:32.563 --> 40:34.222
going about
their daily business.

40:35.500 --> 40:39.700
We believe that the Army
carried out unlawful killings.

40:39.735 --> 40:42.098
Perhaps up to 20.
-

40:43.805 --> 40:45.475
Any questions, please?

40:45.708 --> 40:47.202
:
So the Iraqis were executed?

40:48.304 --> 40:49.941
: That's what
we need to find out.

40:51.307 --> 40:53.648
It's normal in that
lawless part of Iraq

40:53.683 --> 40:55.716
for farmers to carry guns, but

40:56.147 --> 40:57.619
does that make them soldiers?

41:00.987 --> 41:03.251
: British soldiers
are held to high standards

41:03.286 --> 41:04.890
and rightly so.

41:04.925 --> 41:08.124
I see it as part of my job
to hold them to that.

41:08.159 --> 41:10.896
And in my view,
there is powerful evidence

41:10.931 --> 41:14.196
that on the day in question,
they let this country down.

41:14.231 --> 41:16.099
:
So categorically, you're saying

41:16.134 --> 41:18.739
British soldiers
killed civilians in cold blood?

41:18.774 --> 41:21.038
: What I'm saying
is the Army's own

41:21.073 --> 41:23.909
Military Police investigation
closed too soon.

41:23.944 --> 41:25.240
It wasn't good enough.

41:26.410 --> 41:28.914
That's why we've
called upon the government

41:28.949 --> 41:31.587
to set up
a full public inquiry.

41:31.622 --> 41:33.622
:
Brian's phone. Leave a message.

41:33.657 --> 41:35.118
We don't want
to be talked about

41:35.153 --> 41:36.955
in the same way as the Japanese

41:36.990 --> 41:40.090
in the Second World War,
or the Americans at My Lai.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.730
We need to get this
all out in the open

41:42.765 --> 41:45.535
and only a public inquiry
can do that.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.163
:
Several years have passed

41:47.198 --> 41:49.198
since the Battle of Danny Boy,
and the Ministry of Defence

41:49.233 --> 41:51.200
insists the allegations
are unfounded

41:51.642 --> 41:53.301
but has promised
its full cooperation.

41:56.141 --> 41:57.877
It's a summons
to a public inquiry.

42:02.213 --> 42:04.048
This guy, Shiner--
- He's all talk.

42:05.018 --> 42:07.557
Well, he's not all talk, is he?
- It'll come to nothing.

42:09.253 --> 42:10.659
:
You're not looking!

42:12.861 --> 42:13.761
:
Smile!

42:16.062 --> 42:18.062
You know how you
used to complain about me

42:18.097 --> 42:19.536
not wanting to know
what you'd done

42:20.264 --> 42:22.539
when you got your medal?
- I was always joking.

42:23.674 --> 42:27.104
It's you I wanted,
not your medal.

42:27.139 --> 42:28.171
Yeah, I know.

42:29.845 --> 42:30.844
Do you?

42:35.015 --> 42:36.179
Yeah.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.150
Good.

42:56.872 --> 42:59.675
Right, show me
that fucking thing!

42:59.710 --> 43:01.611
:
Gavin! The baby.

43:02.845 --> 43:03.646
The baby.

43:05.683 --> 43:06.308
Sorry, love.

43:07.817 --> 43:08.750
Aye, he's lovely.

43:10.985 --> 43:11.852
Hi.

43:14.791 --> 43:16.252
:
Give you a medal wi' one hand

43:16.287 --> 43:17.660
and knock your teeth oot
wi' the other.

43:18.256 --> 43:19.761
They accuse
you of these things

43:19.796 --> 43:22.027
our own government
accuses you of these things

43:22.062 --> 43:23.633
on the say-so of what?

43:23.668 --> 43:25.030
The men who
were trying to kill you?

43:26.264 --> 43:28.704
"In the Northern engagement,
you participated in

43:28.739 --> 43:30.871
witnessed or were aware of,"
I mean, which one is it?

43:30.906 --> 43:31.938
Jesus Christ.

43:33.711 --> 43:35.139
There's 11 counts here.
You must've been busy.

43:35.174 --> 43:36.305
That's all I can say.

43:38.045 --> 43:39.814
They probably sent the
same letter to all of us, Dad.

43:39.849 --> 43:41.178
No, no way. Look.

43:42.346 --> 43:44.654
"In the course of clearing
the trench with CSM Falconer

43:44.689 --> 43:47.151
and others, you were..."
Blah-blah-blah. You.

43:47.186 --> 43:48.350
Nobody else. You.

43:50.728 --> 43:53.421
The solicitors for the Iraqis
are saying that they were, um...

43:55.095 --> 43:56.666
farmers and not militia.

43:56.701 --> 43:58.668
Are they trying to tell me
you wouldnae know the difference

43:58.703 --> 43:59.900
between a farmer
and a trained killer

43:59.935 --> 44:01.132
working for what-was-his-name?

44:01.167 --> 44:02.364
Muqtada al-Sadr.
- God's sake.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.070
Public inquiry.

44:05.875 --> 44:06.907
The world's gone mad.

44:27.193 --> 44:28.489
:
Listen up. New orders.

44:28.524 --> 44:29.996
We've got to pick up
the enemy dead

44:30.031 --> 44:31.162
and bring them back with us.

44:32.365 --> 44:34.330
Intel reports person
of interest in the field today.

44:34.805 --> 44:36.134
Whose orders is this?

44:37.071 --> 44:39.973
: No one does this.
We shouldn't be doing it.

44:42.912 --> 44:44.208
Fuck this!

44:44.243 --> 44:46.749
They think some local warlord
is among the dead.

44:46.784 --> 44:48.509
So we're taking the
bodies back for ID-ing.

44:48.544 --> 44:50.049
Falconer picked us out for it.

44:52.284 --> 44:54.757
Right, I'll pick him up.

44:54.792 --> 44:56.385
You yank his trousers back up.

44:56.959 --> 44:58.090
What?

44:59.896 --> 45:01.357
Who did all that?

45:03.559 --> 45:07.429
Chain gun could do that.
A 30mm tank shell.

45:10.467 --> 45:12.137
Killing someone's one thing.

45:13.877 --> 45:16.405
Picking them up after,
looking them in the eye...

45:19.278 --> 45:20.915
Tell you what I don't see.

45:20.950 --> 45:23.280
I don't see any village elders
who sent these kids out here

45:23.315 --> 45:26.448
with rifles against a company
full of tanks and Warriors.

46:33.649 --> 46:35.055
:
Drop your fucking weapons!

46:36.355 --> 46:38.124
Killing someone's one thing.

46:38.159 --> 46:39.994
Picking them up after,
looking them in the eye...

46:40.524 --> 46:42.293
Why didn't they shoot us?

46:42.328 --> 46:43.998
Why didn't you shoot us?
We never even saw you.

46:44.396 --> 46:45.494
What kind of soldiers are you?

46:53.240 --> 46:54.910
:
Hey. Hey.

46:55.143 --> 46:56.912
Come on. Come here.

46:56.947 --> 46:59.046
Come on. Hey, come on.

47:00.181 --> 47:01.246
It's alright.

47:01.281 --> 47:02.412
It's alright.

47:03.888 --> 47:06.383
I'm here. Come on. Come inside.

47:07.991 --> 47:08.957
Inside.

47:30.046 --> 47:32.211
: When the judges
approved our judicial review

47:32.477 --> 47:36.248
they slammed the Military Police
and the Ministry of Defence

47:36.283 --> 47:38.184
for not going far enough.

47:38.384 --> 47:41.220
Took our side
on every point of substance.

47:42.091 --> 47:45.422
Left the government no option
but a full public inquiry.

47:45.655 --> 47:47.094
Listen to this, Patrick.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.459
It's not some
Guardian editorial.

47:49.494 --> 47:51.560
This is from
the judge's own ruling.

47:51.595 --> 47:53.969
"In our view, the
Military Police investigation

47:54.004 --> 47:56.367
relating to allegations
of murder and torture

47:56.402 --> 47:59.271
was deficient."
It wasn't fit for purpose.

47:59.702 --> 48:02.043
No major incident room.

48:02.078 --> 48:05.981
Failure to identity or interview
relevant personnel.

48:06.313 --> 48:10.018
Failure to seize all
contemporaneous records.

48:10.053 --> 48:11.954
Failure to interview
the detainees.

48:11.989 --> 48:13.549
Well, you've done
an amazing job, Phil

48:13.584 --> 48:15.254
no one's doubting that.

48:15.289 --> 48:18.092
Getting a public inquiry awarded
is an extraordinary achievement

48:18.127 --> 48:19.390
for a practice this size.

48:20.261 --> 48:21.359
But?

48:22.197 --> 48:23.394
But nothing.

48:23.429 --> 48:26.001
So, the eminent barrister's
coming on board?

48:26.036 --> 48:28.234
Coming on with
the legal team who, uh...

48:28.269 --> 48:29.301
Hang on.

48:30.073 --> 48:31.270
Where is it?

48:31.305 --> 48:34.075
How did the judges
describe us, Deena?

48:34.110 --> 48:36.077
They said we were
greatly outnumbered

48:36.112 --> 48:37.540
by the Secretary of State's
legal team

48:37.575 --> 48:41.082
but persisted with requests
for disclosure skilfully

48:41.117 --> 48:42.644
and with
commendable determination.

48:42.679 --> 48:44.514
Commendable determination,
Patrick.

48:44.549 --> 48:46.516
Couldn't have put it
better myself.

48:46.551 --> 48:49.057
That war shames
our nation, Patrick.

48:49.092 --> 48:50.619
That's not what
the inquiry is about.

48:52.392 --> 48:54.689
Ever thought of getting
a bigger office, Phil?

48:55.098 --> 48:57.527
Having the walls closing in
concentrates the mind.

48:57.562 --> 49:00.068
Doesn't it, Deena?
- That's the theory, yes.

49:00.103 --> 49:02.235
Right, so, what have you got?

49:02.600 --> 49:04.699
"We", Patrick. We. Come on.

49:06.340 --> 49:09.638
We've got 20 dead Iraqis
taken off the battlefield.

49:09.673 --> 49:11.211
Taken why?

49:11.246 --> 49:12.773
The Army says
they needed to ID the bodies

49:12.808 --> 49:14.742
but our witnesses say
at least some of them were alive

49:14.777 --> 49:16.282
when they left the battlefield.

49:16.317 --> 49:18.581
And some of them were beaten
and shot back at the camp

49:18.616 --> 49:20.253
after they were detained.

49:20.288 --> 49:23.091
More to the point, the Army
say they were combatants

49:23.126 --> 49:24.587
and the families say
they weren't.

49:24.622 --> 49:26.754
What are you looking for?
- The trophy pictures.

49:26.789 --> 49:28.360
Over there.
-

49:29.099 --> 49:31.726
Shift your arse, Patrick.
You're sitting on Exhibit A.

49:31.761 --> 49:33.398
: Public Interest
Lawyers. Hi, Carrie.

49:33.433 --> 49:35.136
Is that...?
- Yeah.

49:35.171 --> 49:36.467
Show these to Patrick.

49:36.502 --> 49:38.007
I'll pass you over to him.

49:38.042 --> 49:39.767
Carrie? Hi, yes, I've got...

49:39.802 --> 49:42.209
So these are photos
taken by soldiers on the day.

49:42.244 --> 49:44.343
You can see blood on
the soldiers' hands in this one.

49:45.115 --> 49:47.181
Why do the Army need
to take dead Iraqis for ID-ing

49:47.216 --> 49:48.776
if they had all these
cameras in the field?

49:48.811 --> 49:51.647
Exactly! Carrie, I'm gonna
pass you back to Deena.

49:51.682 --> 49:53.319
One second.
- Oh.

49:54.157 --> 49:56.586
Hi, Carrie...
- There were cameras everywhere.

49:56.621 --> 49:58.357
It doesn't make sense.

49:58.656 --> 49:59.996
Look at these.

50:01.165 --> 50:03.131
Look at the condition of
these prisoners. It's shameful.

50:03.430 --> 50:05.100
I interviewed this guy
in Istanbul.

50:05.135 --> 50:07.762
He's willing to testify.
He's just a farmer.

50:07.797 --> 50:09.269
Almost all of them

50:09.304 --> 50:11.040
say they were denied water.
-

50:11.075 --> 50:12.239
They've clearly
been knocked about.

50:12.274 --> 50:13.834
It's a fucking disgrace,
Patrick

50:13.869 --> 50:15.572
and it's our chance
to expose it.

50:15.607 --> 50:17.376
Our duty to expose it.

50:17.411 --> 50:18.674
:
Phil, that's another delivery.

50:18.709 --> 50:20.214
Well, can you deal with it?

50:20.249 --> 50:22.381
The Iraqi witnesses,
what's your process there?

50:22.416 --> 50:24.515
Er, vetted by my man in Iraq.

50:24.550 --> 50:26.484
If he thinks
they've got what it takes

50:26.519 --> 50:28.090
then I meet them

50:28.125 --> 50:30.158
on neutral ground in Istanbul.
-

50:30.490 --> 50:31.621
The funding?

50:31.656 --> 50:33.326
:
The High Court ordered the MOD

50:33.361 --> 50:35.757
to reimburse all our costs
getting us this far.

50:35.792 --> 50:37.066
:
Door's open, come on up.

50:37.101 --> 50:38.562
You know how many
gallantry awards

50:38.597 --> 50:39.596
went to the soldiers
at Danny Boy?

50:40.236 --> 50:41.268
Ten.

50:41.600 --> 50:42.830
And to a man,
they'll be saying

50:42.865 --> 50:44.667
the Iraqi witnesses are liars.

50:44.702 --> 50:47.175
That the men they killed
were soldiers, shot in battle.

50:47.210 --> 50:49.111
No one was mistreated.
- : Course they will.

50:49.839 --> 50:51.872
But you and I know
what British soldiers

50:51.907 --> 50:53.808
are capable of doing
to detainees.

50:53.843 --> 50:56.184
Baha Mousa proved that.

50:56.219 --> 50:58.186
And this is just as
grave and important as that.

50:59.387 --> 51:02.256
Only more sprawling.
- That's an understatement.

51:03.787 --> 51:06.689
It's an uphill struggle,
Patrick, I get that.

51:06.724 --> 51:08.229
It always is.

51:08.264 --> 51:10.660
There's 40 shipping
containers of disclosure

51:10.695 --> 51:11.760
for us to wade through.

51:11.795 --> 51:14.103
: Signature, please.
- Hm? Oh.

51:15.634 --> 51:18.404
This is the MOD
sending us a haystack, saying

51:18.439 --> 51:20.340
"Good luck finding
the needle." Thanks.

51:20.375 --> 51:21.836
Do you want this job
or don't you?

51:21.871 --> 51:24.113
Cos, as you can probably see

51:24.148 --> 51:25.708
we've got a lot of work
to get through.

51:27.184 --> 51:28.711
I'll start with a sandwich.
- Hm?

51:30.451 --> 51:32.847
Well, they've got crusts on,
Patrick.

51:32.882 --> 51:34.486
Do you think you
can cope with that?

51:38.756 --> 51:41.394
You struggling, Dad?
- Are you havin' a laugh?

51:41.627 --> 51:44.265
Think I cannae
handle a couple of suitcases?

51:44.300 --> 51:46.366
I'll put you through
some proper PT, boy.

51:46.401 --> 51:48.236
Now don't you be worrying,
either of you.

51:48.271 --> 51:49.798
Not gonna worry.
- Call us any time.

51:49.833 --> 51:51.173
Alright.
- We're off.

51:51.208 --> 51:53.175
Good luck.
- See you when I see you.

51:53.210 --> 51:54.671
I'll give you a bell
when we get back.

51:54.706 --> 51:56.838
What's going on, little man?
- : He loves that boy.

51:56.873 --> 51:58.444
Loves them both.

51:58.479 --> 51:59.874
Alright, hen?
You heard what Margaret said.

52:01.350 --> 52:02.613
Get him back for me.

52:04.617 --> 52:06.188
Getting angry at
what's happening to him...

52:07.488 --> 52:09.257
It's not the same
as getting him through it.

52:18.499 --> 52:20.466
Are you trying to tell me
how to father my son?

52:22.470 --> 52:25.405
You've done a very good
job of fathering him, Gavin.

52:25.440 --> 52:29.178
He's just like you.
He's a soldier, like you.

52:29.213 --> 52:31.180
He keeps it all in-house,
like you.

52:31.908 --> 52:33.611
He doesn't let on
what's going on up here

52:33.646 --> 52:35.184
and he really thinks
that's working.

52:36.781 --> 52:38.220
He's like you.

52:38.684 --> 52:39.947
He's just like you.

52:46.692 --> 52:48.758
:
Point two, Charlie, eh?

52:50.234 --> 52:53.235
Point two. Oh! Is that
the one you want to hear?

52:53.666 --> 52:54.995
OK.

52:55.030 --> 52:56.337
Point two.

52:56.372 --> 52:58.405
"That you've given...

52:59.276 --> 53:02.508
an untruthful
and/or inaccurate account

53:03.478 --> 53:06.644
in suggesting that the
Iraqis you apprehended

53:06.679 --> 53:08.679
had with them
any weapons at all.

53:09.550 --> 53:12.485
You're incorrect
to suggest or imply

53:12.520 --> 53:17.259
that they had been
shooting at... British troops."

53:17.294 --> 53:19.624
Three.

53:20.627 --> 53:23.430
"Any failure to
report the misconduct or...

53:25.500 --> 53:28.765
or the allegations of misconduct
of which you were aware

53:29.064 --> 53:31.405
is the direct result...

53:31.440 --> 53:33.968
...by you, deliberately...

53:35.873 --> 53:37.906
to conceal the misconduct
of others."

53:50.426 --> 53:51.854
What kind of soldiers are you?

53:52.824 --> 53:54.659
What's that?
- Hm?

53:56.597 --> 53:57.827
What was what, sir?

54:00.029 --> 54:03.437
See you got a letter, then,
Woody. That from the inquiry?

54:03.670 --> 54:05.670
Yeah. I did, sir.

54:06.673 --> 54:07.573
Me too.

54:09.346 --> 54:10.675
How's that sitting
with you now, then?

54:12.877 --> 54:14.008
I love soldiering, sir.

54:15.649 --> 54:16.780
I do, but...

54:17.750 --> 54:18.947
right now, it's...

54:20.357 --> 54:22.324
Train you up,
send you out to fight

54:22.359 --> 54:23.820
then you get back
for questioning.

54:23.855 --> 54:26.020
I mean, what's that about?
- Yeah, they were firing at us.

54:26.055 --> 54:27.956
Yeah, live rounds.

54:28.530 --> 54:31.762
And, no, I didn't...
gouge anyone's eye out.

54:33.634 --> 54:34.831
You had all that, too?

54:35.801 --> 54:36.866
Yeah.

54:38.903 --> 54:40.309
Still think about them days?

54:41.345 --> 54:42.641
Danny Boy and the rest?

54:43.512 --> 54:44.907
Five years ago now. More.

54:48.682 --> 54:50.011
I do, sir.

54:50.948 --> 54:51.947
Yeah.

54:53.423 --> 54:54.389
Tough days.

54:56.085 --> 54:57.084
Punchy days.

54:59.594 --> 55:00.593
Yeah.

55:01.728 --> 55:03.024
Immense.

55:07.602 --> 55:09.470
Who do you talk to
about them days?

55:11.870 --> 55:13.100
Prefer to just sort of...

55:14.774 --> 55:17.478
you know,
keep it where it is, sir.

55:17.513 --> 55:18.611
For the time being.

55:18.646 --> 55:20.448
Got a shifting cargo,
though, Woody.

55:20.813 --> 55:21.944
You sure that's a good idea?

55:24.179 --> 55:25.486
Ever thought
about knocking on a door

55:25.521 --> 55:26.718
and getting some help with that?

55:27.820 --> 55:29.457
I'm fine, sir.

55:29.492 --> 55:30.821
You were just a kid then, Woody.

55:32.594 --> 55:33.560
But you're not now.

55:35.498 --> 55:36.629
Knock on a door.

55:39.535 --> 55:40.600
I did.

55:56.585 --> 55:58.684
OK. Stress test.

55:59.148 --> 56:00.917
Their claims against ours.

56:01.524 --> 56:02.688
Deena.

56:02.954 --> 56:04.954
The orders
to take away the bodies.

56:04.989 --> 56:06.560
Everything flows from that.

56:06.958 --> 56:08.727
If they were dead,
like the Army says

56:08.762 --> 56:11.598
removing them is unprecedented
and needs a better explanation.

56:11.633 --> 56:13.864
If they were alive,
like the families say...

56:14.933 --> 56:16.097
then they must've
been executed.

56:16.539 --> 56:18.902
Hm. So who gave that order?

56:20.004 --> 56:21.509
No one seems to know.

56:23.172 --> 56:25.678
If the dead bodies
needed ID-ing

56:25.944 --> 56:28.516
why didn't they
photograph them there? Hm?

56:30.047 --> 56:31.684
Instead of transporting them.

56:32.522 --> 56:35.556
The trophy pictures show
that there were cameras present.

56:38.154 --> 56:39.153
If you were an Iraqi mother

56:39.188 --> 56:40.891
searching through
shredded bodies

56:40.926 --> 56:42.530
in a morgue two days later

56:42.565 --> 56:44.191
you would suspect
something very bad.

56:45.095 --> 56:46.831
Lots of unanswered questions.

56:48.835 --> 56:49.867
Patrick.

56:50.936 --> 56:52.199
Bit of balance?

56:53.477 --> 56:54.575
Well, the inquiry
will want to test

56:54.610 --> 56:56.038
the credibility
of the witnesses.

56:56.073 --> 56:57.644
When did their injuries occur?

56:57.679 --> 56:58.843
How can anyone be sure

56:58.878 --> 57:00.075
they weren't members
of a militia group?

57:00.110 --> 57:01.208
And the dead, too,
for that matter--

57:01.243 --> 57:02.682
The militia stuff...

57:03.951 --> 57:05.817
Neither side can prove that.
That's our word against theirs.

57:05.852 --> 57:07.984
It's not "our" word, Phil,
it's the witnesses'.

57:08.690 --> 57:11.526
We present their evidence
to the inquiry, we don't own it.

57:12.254 --> 57:13.561
Very noble, Patrick.

57:15.829 --> 57:17.961
Why did the Military Police
drop their investigation?

57:19.668 --> 57:21.096
Incompetence or cover-up?

57:21.131 --> 57:22.603
OK, what do we say to that one?

57:22.638 --> 57:24.770
We say incompetence
or cover-up. Anything else?

57:24.805 --> 57:26.673
As I'm reading, I'm trying
to put myself in the position

57:26.708 --> 57:28.708
of the Army soldiers.
- Useful exercise.

57:28.743 --> 57:30.270
If you're fired up
and you've been shot at

57:30.305 --> 57:32.074
and you're charging
across a field

57:32.109 --> 57:33.548
and someone puts
their hands up...

57:34.848 --> 57:36.716
where does the war bit stop

57:36.751 --> 57:38.883
and the arrest
and restraint bit start?

57:38.918 --> 57:40.918
: That's the inquiry's
focus in a nutshell.

57:40.953 --> 57:42.623
What happens after
the war bit stops?

57:42.658 --> 57:45.021
It's grey... It's a grey area.

57:45.595 --> 57:46.253
OK.

57:47.223 --> 57:49.058
It is. So, you're fired up

57:49.962 --> 57:51.258
you've been shot at

57:51.634 --> 57:54.998
you've taken a guy
with his hands up prisoner

57:55.704 --> 57:57.902
and you live that grey area,
you're in it.

58:00.071 --> 58:02.236
Maybe you knock him about.
Is that what you're saying?

58:02.271 --> 58:04.645
Why wouldn't you?
- I guess.

58:05.010 --> 58:07.175
Hm. Well, here's your answer.

58:09.212 --> 58:11.080
Because
they're British soldiers.

58:11.852 --> 58:12.884
They're trained

58:12.919 --> 58:14.985
to be better than that.
- Right.

58:15.020 --> 58:17.053
I mean, either they are
or they aren't. Right?

58:18.188 --> 58:20.628
Either they are better
than that or they're not.

58:24.898 --> 58:26.227
Sorry. Have to take this.

58:27.263 --> 58:29.098
Hello? Yeah.

58:29.573 --> 58:30.968
And...

58:32.873 --> 58:34.642
Go on.
-

58:34.677 --> 58:37.645
The arrangements we used
to gather our witnesses

58:37.680 --> 58:39.306
the fact that we've
operated through a middleman

58:39.341 --> 58:41.616
some of the financial
arrangements...

58:41.651 --> 58:42.518
What?

58:45.380 --> 58:48.216
Well... is all of that
definitely OK?

58:50.924 --> 58:52.990
We literally had no choice.

58:54.895 --> 58:59.161
Either we let the killings of
20 potentially innocent Iraqis

58:59.196 --> 59:02.604
go unchallenged,
or we do what we did.

59:03.068 --> 59:04.298
What choice did we have?

59:05.840 --> 59:07.543
If we win,
it'll all be forgotten.

59:08.370 --> 59:10.172
If we lose,
it'll all be irrelevant.

59:22.725 --> 59:24.593
: Can't abide
the coffee they have here.

59:25.728 --> 59:27.695
But if I leave my
good coffee in the kitchen

59:27.730 --> 59:28.795
everyone drinks it.

59:29.699 --> 59:31.325
I've had your statement typed up

59:31.360 --> 59:34.603
into the same basic form
as the other soldiers.

59:34.638 --> 59:36.132
I want you to
read it through now

59:36.167 --> 59:38.266
and say if it's an accurate
reflection of what you told me.

59:41.073 --> 59:42.842
Let's have it out loud.

59:43.042 --> 59:44.613
There's a good chap.

59:44.648 --> 59:45.372
It's good practice.

59:45.946 --> 59:46.978
Yeah.

59:57.320 --> 1:00:02.224
"I deployed to Iraq
on the 8th of April 2004

1:00:02.259 --> 1:00:04.699
in support of Operation TELIC 4.

1:00:06.703 --> 1:00:10.903
I deployed as a Lance Corporal
with A Platoon, C Company

1:00:10.938 --> 1:00:13.367
1st Battalion, the Princess
of Wales's Royal Regiment.

1:00:16.713 --> 1:00:19.076
This was my first
deployment to Iraq.

1:00:19.111 --> 1:00:21.342
My role was as
dismount commander

1:00:21.916 --> 1:00:24.048
and I would rarely
get out of the Warrior

1:00:24.083 --> 1:00:26.083
as we would be
vulnerable to incoming fire.

1:00:26.118 --> 1:00:28.987
The plan was to go
to the side of trench one

1:00:29.022 --> 1:00:30.659
and take the enemy by surprise.

1:00:30.694 --> 1:00:32.056
Three of us returned fire

1:00:32.091 --> 1:00:34.256
in an attempt to
suppress the enemy position.

1:00:34.291 --> 1:00:35.829
When I reached the trench

1:00:35.864 --> 1:00:38.700
there were still four
enemy combatants within it.

1:00:38.735 --> 1:00:41.098
One of them
was shouting in Arabic.

1:00:43.135 --> 1:00:45.806
: He had his hands in
the air and continued to shout.

1:00:45.841 --> 1:00:47.643
Get down! Get down!

1:00:47.909 --> 1:00:50.844
I shouted back at him
something along the lines of...

1:00:51.176 --> 1:00:52.780
Get your fucking hands up!

1:00:52.815 --> 1:00:54.078
:
"Put your fucking hands up."

1:00:54.751 --> 1:00:56.311
The detainees were
grabbed by their clothes

1:00:56.346 --> 1:00:58.379
or arms and forced down.

1:00:58.414 --> 1:01:00.447
There was a large
number of weapons.

1:01:00.482 --> 1:01:02.053
Once the search
had been completed

1:01:02.088 --> 1:01:03.351
the detainees' hands
were plasticuffed

1:01:03.386 --> 1:01:04.485
and they were blindfolded.

1:01:04.521 --> 1:01:07.058
CSM Falconer took
charge of the situation

1:01:07.093 --> 1:01:08.455
and said that he and I
were to advance

1:01:08.490 --> 1:01:09.689
to trench two
to check it was clear.

1:01:09.725 --> 1:01:13.031
I saw an enemy combatant
stand up and aim at CSM Falconer

1:01:13.066 --> 1:01:14.299
who reacted very quickly.

1:01:14.334 --> 1:01:17.167
Immediately after this,
I saw another aimed at me.

1:01:17.202 --> 1:01:19.708
I fired two rounds at him
and saw him drop to the ground.

1:01:19.743 --> 1:01:21.072
As we were walking back

1:01:21.107 --> 1:01:22.843
two enemy emerged
with their hands up.

1:01:23.076 --> 1:01:25.780
We had not seen them
or been aware of them at all.

1:01:25.815 --> 1:01:27.507
It was lucky for us
that they chose to surrender

1:01:27.542 --> 1:01:28.750
rather than engage.

1:01:34.219 --> 1:01:36.692
The order to collect the dead
was an unusual order.

1:01:37.761 --> 1:01:39.827
It would be normal to leave
the dead on the battlefield.

1:01:42.260 --> 1:01:44.425
I had not been in
such a situation previously

1:01:44.933 --> 1:01:47.098
and collecting the dead
was a horrible job

1:01:47.133 --> 1:01:48.495
that no one wanted to do.

1:02:01.785 --> 1:02:03.114
I was not offered
any counselling

1:02:03.149 --> 1:02:04.445
when I returned from my tour.

1:02:05.514 --> 1:02:07.217
I do not recall
attending any debrief

1:02:07.252 --> 1:02:08.515
at the end of my tour either.

1:02:10.860 --> 1:02:13.289
I believe the facts in this
witness statement are true."

1:02:18.197 --> 1:02:19.229
:
OK.

1:02:23.334 --> 1:02:24.465
Well done.

1:02:36.281 --> 1:02:37.412
You alright?

1:02:44.058 --> 1:02:44.991
Hang on.

1:02:56.037 --> 1:02:57.333
Isn't he home?

1:02:57.368 --> 1:02:59.071
He's usually home by now.

1:02:59.106 --> 1:03:00.270
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

1:03:02.978 --> 1:03:04.142
You haven't knocked?

1:03:11.250 --> 1:03:12.216
You were right.

1:03:14.319 --> 1:03:15.582
You were right in what you said.

1:03:18.928 --> 1:03:19.993
OK.

1:03:21.898 --> 1:03:23.524
Do you wanna come in?
- No, just...

1:03:23.559 --> 1:03:25.592
Just get Brian out here for me,
will you, love?

1:03:51.653 --> 1:03:53.026
Brian.
- Dad.

1:04:07.009 --> 1:04:08.272
You know I love you, son.

1:04:11.046 --> 1:04:12.474
Up to now, maybe.
Is that what you're saying?

1:04:12.509 --> 1:04:14.443
See, that's just exactly it.
That's...

1:04:15.149 --> 1:04:17.413
That's exactly it. That's where
Lucy's got her head screwed on

1:04:17.448 --> 1:04:19.987
and me and you havnae.
That's... See, that's what it...

1:04:20.022 --> 1:04:21.923
That's where
she's exactly right.

1:04:21.958 --> 1:04:23.287
Lucy? Dad...

1:04:23.322 --> 1:04:25.190
Keep it all in-house,
keep it in the headspace.

1:04:25.225 --> 1:04:26.389
What's the fucking point, eh?

1:04:33.068 --> 1:04:34.430
I can see what
you're doing, Brian

1:04:34.465 --> 1:04:35.871
and you took your cue from me.

1:04:37.171 --> 1:04:39.039
And it's no good.
It's no good at all.

1:04:39.976 --> 1:04:41.910
I shouldnae have done it
and you shouldnae be doing it.

1:04:41.945 --> 1:04:43.978
All that, "I'm a tough guy"
bollocks.

1:04:44.013 --> 1:04:46.244
Cos that's what it is.
Total bollocks.

1:04:47.511 --> 1:04:49.544
There's naebody tough.
None of us.

1:04:49.579 --> 1:04:52.250
No' me. No' you.
No' Arnie bloody...

1:04:52.285 --> 1:04:53.383
Schwarzenegger.

1:04:54.287 --> 1:04:55.451
Aye.

1:05:03.065 --> 1:05:04.658
You remember how I told you
about my pal

1:05:04.693 --> 1:05:07.661
who got shot by the IRA?
Shot and killed by the IRA?

1:05:08.433 --> 1:05:09.663
Yeah.

1:05:10.866 --> 1:05:12.633
And how I got promoted to
Lance Corporal cos he was dead.

1:05:14.010 --> 1:05:15.537
Right after the funeral.

1:05:16.012 --> 1:05:17.440
They even give me his callsign.

1:05:20.082 --> 1:05:22.346
I didn't... I didn't know that.
- Aye, well, now you do.

1:05:29.091 --> 1:05:31.025
I didnae even think about it.
I was 20 years old.

1:05:31.753 --> 1:05:33.522
But see, later,
that gnawed at me.

1:05:36.362 --> 1:05:37.592
It gnawed at me.

1:05:38.496 --> 1:05:40.232
You know, his dying
and me just stepping up

1:05:40.267 --> 1:05:42.366
and saying to the major,
"Aye, sure, gimme his stripes.

1:05:42.401 --> 1:05:43.664
I'll take his callsign."

1:05:45.107 --> 1:05:46.403
It's like I wiped him
off the record.

1:05:46.438 --> 1:05:48.174
No thought about anything else.

1:05:48.209 --> 1:05:50.143
"Just gotta get these
tapes sewed on." That was it.

1:05:55.447 --> 1:05:56.952
But he found his way back in.

1:05:59.649 --> 1:06:00.582
And rightly so.

1:06:03.191 --> 1:06:05.521
There's never been a day
from that moment to this

1:06:05.556 --> 1:06:08.161
that I havnae thought about him,
but did I tell anybody?

1:06:09.329 --> 1:06:10.757
Dad--
- You know what it...

1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:13.661
You know what it felt like?
It felt like...

1:06:16.600 --> 1:06:19.106
It felt like I had
to live my life and his.

1:06:20.043 --> 1:06:21.042
That's what it felt like.

1:06:23.475 --> 1:06:26.014
That's what I meant when I said
the dead have questions for you.

1:06:28.678 --> 1:06:30.249
You see, when you join the Army

1:06:30.284 --> 1:06:31.646
you're part of
something massive.

1:06:31.681 --> 1:06:33.252
You know,
"We're all in this together."

1:06:33.287 --> 1:06:35.386
But see, when it comes
to the knocks you take, we're...

1:06:35.586 --> 1:06:36.750
we're all a closed book.

1:06:39.227 --> 1:06:40.391
OK.

1:06:43.132 --> 1:06:44.791
I'm not a good example, Brian.

1:06:45.530 --> 1:06:46.694
And that hurts me.

1:06:48.368 --> 1:06:50.434
It hurts me to see you
following that example.

1:06:53.670 --> 1:06:56.209
OK. Come in now, Dad. Come on.

1:06:56.244 --> 1:06:58.046
No, no, no.
I've said what I came to say.

1:07:07.816 --> 1:07:09.552
I couldn't be
more proud of you, son!

1:07:11.688 --> 1:07:13.193
I couldnae be more proud of you.

1:07:15.890 --> 1:07:17.164
It's me I'm ashamed of.

1:07:17.892 --> 1:07:19.529
For not saying it to you sooner.

1:07:22.567 --> 1:07:25.535
I said to your mother, I said
I couldnae even contemplate...

1:07:25.570 --> 1:07:27.438
Aye, sure, I served 23 years

1:07:27.473 --> 1:07:29.770
but I cannae even contemplate
what my son went through.

1:07:32.445 --> 1:07:33.741
I'm in awe of that.

1:07:37.747 --> 1:07:39.219
I have no experience of that.

1:07:43.753 --> 1:07:45.258
And that hurts, as a father.

1:07:48.461 --> 1:07:50.428
I sent you places
I've never been.

1:07:58.801 --> 1:07:59.833
You were there, Dad.

1:08:04.246 --> 1:08:05.278
You were there.

1:08:20.328 --> 1:08:21.228
Oh, no!

1:08:22.759 --> 1:08:24.462
- Babe.

1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:25.859
What did you say to him?

1:08:29.502 --> 1:08:31.469
I said he should tell you
what was on his mind.

1:08:33.671 --> 1:08:34.868
And did he?
- Yeah.

1:08:36.410 --> 1:08:38.212
Well, that's a good start then,
isn't it?

1:08:38.247 --> 1:08:39.114
Yeah.

1:08:42.614 --> 1:08:43.679
Alright, Bailey boy.

1:08:44.418 --> 1:08:46.781
You beat your mum.
Can you beat your dad?

1:08:48.554 --> 1:08:49.883
That was a good shot.

1:08:49.918 --> 1:08:50.884
And again.

1:08:51.491 --> 1:08:53.755
Oh-ho-ho. Oh!

1:09:02.832 --> 1:09:04.832
Dad!

1:09:08.409 --> 1:09:09.573
Bastard.

1:09:24.018 --> 1:09:26.260
:
A public inquiry opens today

1:09:26.295 --> 1:09:27.921
into some of the
most serious allegations

1:09:27.956 --> 1:09:29.725
to have emerged
from the Iraq war.

1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:31.925
It'll examine claims
that British troops

1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:33.729
murdered up to 20 Iraqis

1:09:33.764 --> 1:09:35.731
following a gun battle in 2004

1:09:36.371 --> 1:09:38.404
and that nine detainees
were mistreated.

1:09:38.439 --> 1:09:39.768
:
The inquiry is expected

1:09:39.803 --> 1:09:40.967
to last for around a year.

1:09:41.002 --> 1:09:42.804
Stop, please, sir.
Thank you.

1:09:42.839 --> 1:09:44.806
Just a few last-minute thoughts.

1:09:45.413 --> 1:09:48.777
Oh. Even more last-minute
than your 2am email?

1:09:49.043 --> 1:09:51.681
The inquiry's terms of
reference are as follows

1:09:51.716 --> 1:09:55.652
and I quote: "To investigate
and report on the allegations

1:09:55.687 --> 1:09:59.293
made by the claimants
against British soldiers.

1:09:59.328 --> 1:10:01.724
It is also necessary to examine

1:10:02.331 --> 1:10:04.925
the broad circumstances
of the battle, the conduct

1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:07.730
and the actions of the soldiers
and Iraqis involved

1:10:07.765 --> 1:10:09.963
and the manner
and cause of death.

1:10:09.998 --> 1:10:12.768
: Why is this
inquiry taking place?

1:10:12.803 --> 1:10:15.903
This is a legitimate question
for all participants to ask

1:10:15.938 --> 1:10:17.410
in light of the public expense

1:10:17.643 --> 1:10:19.610
and resources
inevitably involved.

1:10:20.976 --> 1:10:22.448
There is a clear answer

1:10:22.483 --> 1:10:24.912
and that is because
of the credible allegations

1:10:24.947 --> 1:10:28.223
of unlawful killing by British
soldiers of Iraqi civilians...

1:10:28.489 --> 1:10:29.653
Tank chaser.

1:10:31.624 --> 1:10:33.261
You care to repeat that?

1:10:33.296 --> 1:10:34.856
Why do you hate us so much,
Mr Shiner?

1:10:36.893 --> 1:10:38.662
I've represented more soldiers

1:10:38.697 --> 1:10:40.301
than any other lawyer
in the country.

1:10:40.336 --> 1:10:42.028
:
Disaffected soldiers, maybe.

1:10:42.063 --> 1:10:44.833
Is there any other kind,
really? In the end?

1:10:53.943 --> 1:10:55.910
: A boy at school
says you're a murderer.

1:10:56.814 --> 1:10:58.418
And that's what's upsetting you?

1:10:58.651 --> 1:10:59.749
That is upsetting.

1:11:01.423 --> 1:11:02.752
And what'd you say?

1:11:02.952 --> 1:11:04.358
He didn't say it to me.

1:11:05.394 --> 1:11:06.459
He just said it.

1:11:06.494 --> 1:11:08.395
Well, he must've
said it to somebody.

1:11:16.031 --> 1:11:17.701
Come here, little man.

1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:21.837
Say you're not.

1:11:23.071 --> 1:11:24.807
Not what?
- Dad.

1:11:25.909 --> 1:11:26.941
Bailey...

1:11:28.813 --> 1:11:30.549
do I look like a murderer
to you?

1:11:33.587 --> 1:11:34.421
Hm?

1:11:35.083 --> 1:11:36.555
Come on. Get to bed.

1:11:40.462 --> 1:11:41.725
Right, goodnight.

1:11:53.068 --> 1:11:55.541
Did you forget your kecks?

1:11:55.576 --> 1:11:56.674
Is that a problem?

1:12:02.748 --> 1:12:03.879
You OK?

1:12:05.553 --> 1:12:06.552
Yeah, I'm OK.

1:12:08.754 --> 1:12:10.017
Sure you don't want me to come?

1:12:10.558 --> 1:12:11.392
Yeah.

1:12:12.186 --> 1:12:13.658
Yeah, no, I'll be fine.

1:12:14.859 --> 1:12:15.990
I'll be thinking about you.

1:12:20.733 --> 1:12:23.503
Babe, I'm taking Bailey
to school before I go to London.

1:12:24.539 --> 1:12:25.604
OK.

1:12:31.579 --> 1:12:32.809
Cheers.

1:12:36.881 --> 1:12:38.782
Yo, let's get a move on.

1:12:40.082 --> 1:12:42.984
Hey, you be good for your mum
now, little man. Yeah?

1:12:43.019 --> 1:12:45.492
And you be good for me too.

1:12:45.527 --> 1:12:47.692
Yeah. I'll be as
good as gold, babe.

1:12:49.190 --> 1:12:50.464
Yo.

1:12:52.831 --> 1:12:55.634
Love you. Have a good day.
- Thanks.

1:13:01.576 --> 1:13:02.674
So...

1:13:03.777 --> 1:13:06.106
someone at school said
that I was a murderer, yeah?

1:13:09.012 --> 1:13:10.583
Do you think
they'd say that to my face?

1:13:11.619 --> 1:13:13.520
Huh? Why not?

1:13:14.688 --> 1:13:16.116
Cos you're bigger than them.
- Yeah?

1:13:16.987 --> 1:13:19.757
And who's bigger? Them or you?

1:13:20.661 --> 1:13:21.759
Them.

1:13:21.794 --> 1:13:22.892
Yeah.

1:13:24.962 --> 1:13:25.994
Don't come to school, Dad.

1:13:28.768 --> 1:13:30.064
Hey. Come here.

1:13:33.003 --> 1:13:34.101
Look...

1:13:35.544 --> 1:13:36.840
for the record, Bailey...

1:13:38.745 --> 1:13:39.909
I did kill people.

1:13:40.945 --> 1:13:43.077
In Iraq... in a battle.

1:13:45.279 --> 1:13:46.652
But I'm a soldier

1:13:47.556 --> 1:13:49.490
and sometimes,
that's what soldiers have to do.

1:13:54.123 --> 1:13:55.188
What do you think about that?

1:14:04.001 --> 1:14:05.099
OK.

1:14:07.906 --> 1:14:12.139
There's a difference between
that and being a murderer.

1:14:13.307 --> 1:14:14.548
What is it?

1:14:16.849 --> 1:14:19.047
That's what I'm going
to London today to talk about.

1:14:38.134 --> 1:14:39.474
Who's up today?

1:14:40.103 --> 1:14:42.169
Brian Wood and...

1:14:42.776 --> 1:14:43.841
Chris Broome.

1:14:48.782 --> 1:14:50.045
What's that?

1:14:58.924 --> 1:15:00.627
Who sent this?

1:15:00.926 --> 1:15:03.960
The inquiry wanted an audit
of evidence for disclosure

1:15:03.995 --> 1:15:07.293
from all the different teams.
This just turned up.

1:15:07.328 --> 1:15:10.670
Turned up? From where?
From our side?

1:15:10.705 --> 1:15:12.298
Maybe it was at the
bottom of a pile somewhere.

1:15:15.578 --> 1:15:17.138
So the local warlord

1:15:17.778 --> 1:15:20.680
lists all Iraqi dead
and detainees as his soldiers.

1:15:21.045 --> 1:15:22.176
Everyone there on the day.

1:15:25.346 --> 1:15:26.554
Shit.

1:15:29.889 --> 1:15:32.021
If they were soldiers,
not farmers

1:15:32.056 --> 1:15:33.924
the inquiry won't believe
anything else we say.

1:15:35.092 --> 1:15:36.564
Why didn't we know about this?

1:15:37.864 --> 1:15:39.765
We should have known about this!

1:15:42.396 --> 1:15:43.263
Phil!

1:15:48.776 --> 1:15:50.171
For all we know, it's...

1:15:50.844 --> 1:15:52.811
it's complete bullshit. It's...

1:15:53.913 --> 1:15:58.179
propaganda put about
by local Iraqi militia.

1:15:59.655 --> 1:16:01.688
Turning them into martyrs.
It's...

1:16:01.723 --> 1:16:03.283
The judge will
throw it out as irrelevant.

1:16:03.318 --> 1:16:05.384
Will he?
How can you know that?

1:16:05.419 --> 1:16:08.024
Cos Patrick will point them
in that direction. It's obvious.

1:16:08.059 --> 1:16:10.862
You told me a case is only as
strong as its weakest evidence.

1:16:10.897 --> 1:16:12.732
This casts doubt
on our witnesses!

1:16:12.767 --> 1:16:14.360
I'll tell you
what's not in doubt.

1:16:14.395 --> 1:16:16.362
They're a bunch
of lads with Kalashnikovs

1:16:16.397 --> 1:16:18.870
that British troops
threw 13,000 rounds at.

1:16:19.136 --> 1:16:20.641
That's what they are.

1:16:20.676 --> 1:16:23.369
Lads at breakfast,
soldiers at teatime

1:16:23.404 --> 1:16:25.844
lads again by bedtime,
if they lasted that long.

1:16:26.275 --> 1:16:27.681
I'll brief Patrick.

1:16:57.273 --> 1:16:58.712
What did they say?
- About the list?

1:16:58.747 --> 1:16:59.438
What do you think?

1:16:59.473 --> 1:17:01.110
They're taking it at face value?

1:17:01.145 --> 1:17:03.178
Inquiry's already underwhelmed
by some of our witnesses

1:17:03.213 --> 1:17:05.719
and it's on headed paper,
it's got a bloody rubber stamp.

1:17:05.754 --> 1:17:08.216
It's probably just a boast,
not a fucking employment record.

1:17:08.251 --> 1:17:10.889
Our witnesses have most probably
never even seen that list.

1:17:10.924 --> 1:17:12.088
Yeah, shame we hadn't either.

1:17:12.123 --> 1:17:13.958
It makes no difference.

1:17:14.191 --> 1:17:16.928
It makes no difference at all
to the human rights issues.

1:17:16.963 --> 1:17:18.897
It makes no difference
to what's important.

1:17:18.932 --> 1:17:21.262
It's one piece of evidence
amongst a mountain of stuff.

1:17:21.297 --> 1:17:22.703
It's not one piece,
though, is it?

1:17:22.738 --> 1:17:24.331
It's part of a picture
that's emerging.

1:17:24.366 --> 1:17:26.333
A picture that's not
the one you wanted to see.

1:17:26.368 --> 1:17:29.171
It doesn't mean that terrible
things didn't happen that day

1:17:29.206 --> 1:17:31.140
or that everything
our witnesses say is lies.

1:17:31.175 --> 1:17:32.911
I know that, Phil.

1:17:32.946 --> 1:17:35.111
But things like this,
you start to look at best naive

1:17:35.146 --> 1:17:36.343
and at worst mendacious.

1:17:37.786 --> 1:17:38.983
It came out of nowhere!

1:17:39.018 --> 1:17:41.051
It came out of
somewhere you didn't look.

1:18:46.855 --> 1:18:48.789
: Some evidence
has just come to light.

1:18:49.924 --> 1:18:52.485
An official list
from the local Iraqi militia.

1:18:53.422 --> 1:18:56.423
It clearly identifies all
the dead and all the detainees

1:18:57.525 --> 1:18:59.393
as members of their armed group.

1:19:00.968 --> 1:19:03.265
It looks like they
weren't just farmers, Brian.

1:19:31.394 --> 1:19:33.064
You know what my
vehicle commander said?

1:19:34.595 --> 1:19:37.068
At Danny Boy, when it was over?

1:19:39.842 --> 1:19:41.468
He said he didn't
see the elders there.

1:19:45.045 --> 1:19:46.341
Didn't see the ones in charge

1:19:46.376 --> 1:19:48.442
who'd sent these kids out
in flip-flops to fight us.

1:19:52.052 --> 1:19:53.282
Then sent them
halfway round the world

1:19:53.317 --> 1:19:54.580
to fight us again in court.

1:19:56.386 --> 1:19:58.122
Where are they
when shit hits the fan?

1:20:00.489 --> 1:20:01.829
Well, quite.

1:20:01.864 --> 1:20:04.062
If these people wanna go
and make war a crime

1:20:04.097 --> 1:20:05.624
that's up to them

1:20:05.659 --> 1:20:07.560
but I didn't do anything
to be ashamed of in Al Amara.

1:20:09.135 --> 1:20:10.431
I fought for my country.

1:20:12.105 --> 1:20:13.401
And I'm proud of what I did.

1:20:23.116 --> 1:20:24.819
But not doing
anything to be ashamed of...

1:20:27.186 --> 1:20:29.021
doesn't stop me
from feeling ashamed.

1:21:17.302 --> 1:21:19.335
-

1:21:19.370 --> 1:21:21.139
Who's that?

1:21:21.174 --> 1:21:22.371
: How does it feel
to be accused of war crimes?

1:21:22.406 --> 1:21:23.504
:
Brian Wood.

1:22:01.049 --> 1:22:04.545
leaves are falling...

1:22:07.418 --> 1:22:08.648
Corporal Wood?

1:22:53.266 --> 1:22:54.397
Who's going to be there?

1:22:55.829 --> 1:22:57.202
Lawyers, mainly.

1:22:57.237 --> 1:22:58.302
Um...

1:22:59.107 --> 1:23:00.370
Some soldiers.

1:23:00.768 --> 1:23:01.976
People from Iraq.

1:23:03.111 --> 1:23:05.045
Because you killed people?

1:23:05.278 --> 1:23:08.114
Well, not just me. There was
a lot of people killed, mate.

1:23:10.811 --> 1:23:13.680
And when you've talked about it,
then what?

1:23:14.749 --> 1:23:18.553
Well, when I've finished
talking about it, then, er...

1:23:22.493 --> 1:23:24.196
then I've finished
with being a soldier.
