WEBVTT

00:17.017 --> 00:20.455
Double-lock the cuffs.Yes, sir.

00:20.498 --> 00:21.760
Officer, you're on this cell.

00:21.804 --> 00:22.979
I want you to secure
your weapon.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.111
Got it.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.073
Enough. Enough.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.249
You guys, settle down.In the cell. Settle down.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.208
Come on.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.777
61s. 61s.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.127
I got it. Thanks, Sarge.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.088
Officer. When you're done
with these two,

00:45.132 --> 00:47.873
they're going up to the
detective squad. You got it?

00:50.789 --> 00:53.009
Okay, what time was this?

00:53.053 --> 00:55.011
I don't know, half an hour ago?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.273
You take this route a lot?

00:56.317 --> 00:58.841
Sure. But it was
so dark tonight.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.757
Would you be able to identify
the person that robbed you?

01:01.800 --> 01:06.153
No, not really.
He just, he came out of nowhere.

01:06.196 --> 01:09.678
When I tried to fight him off,
he started screaming.

01:09.721 --> 01:10.940
What was he screaming?

01:10.983 --> 01:14.857
He said... he said I was

01:14.900 --> 01:18.165
a drunk little whore
who was asking for it.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.385
What were you asking for, Leah?

01:23.735 --> 01:25.520
To be raped.

01:25.563 --> 01:29.132
Did he?

01:29.176 --> 01:33.615
No, he just stuck his hand
up my shirt, down my pants,

01:33.658 --> 01:35.399
grabbed my bag and ran away.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.708
I drank too much.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.710
I shouldn't have
gone out so late.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.886
I should've gone home
with my roommate.

01:43.929 --> 01:47.716
You know what?
How about we not blame you?

01:47.759 --> 01:50.936
How about we blame the guy
that did this to you?

01:50.980 --> 01:52.590
Does that sound good?

01:57.073 --> 01:58.509
Yeah.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.821
At least watching paint dry, you
know there's nothing you can do.

02:05.864 --> 02:07.910
GORMLEY:
Well, you can do what I'm doing.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.390
You're just staring
out the window.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.218
Not just. I'm thinking
what smart policing

02:11.261 --> 02:13.002
our protocol is.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.395
Each patrol
borough commander

02:14.438 --> 02:17.572
responsible for his territory
during a blackout.

02:17.615 --> 02:18.964
Except that the
smartest guy in the room

02:19.008 --> 02:20.227
is left out of the loop.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.576
That doesn't make sense to me.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.578
It's an antiquated protocol.

02:23.621 --> 02:26.494
I see no reason why we can't
be involved here.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.931
GORMLEY: Boss, the boots on the
ground have to call the shots.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.803
Up here, we're compromised
in terms of incoming intel flow.

02:31.847 --> 02:32.978
From where I sit,

02:33.022 --> 02:34.937
I'm not compromised.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.765
We have a generator,
we have lights.

02:36.808 --> 02:37.983
One PP is fully functional.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.464
GORMLEY:
In a post 9/11 New York,

02:40.508 --> 02:43.946
you got to go local and
retail, in some situations.

02:43.989 --> 02:46.601
Is that a quote from the last
commissioner's autobiography?

02:46.644 --> 02:48.777
BAKER:
And a blackout hardly compares

02:48.820 --> 02:49.995
to a terrorist attack.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.214
You want to rewrite our system

02:51.258 --> 02:52.520
for the state of emergency?

02:52.563 --> 02:54.739
After tonight, I might.

02:56.611 --> 02:59.004
Oh. Power's back on.

03:01.529 --> 03:04.967
And back where it belongs.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.839
Let's get to work.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.246
DANNY: So we got nothing?OFFICER: Not much.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.856
DANNY: And let me guess, the
cameras couldn't see anything

03:24.900 --> 03:26.206
in the blackout, either?

03:26.249 --> 03:27.685
Just as dark as the
rest of the city.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.210
Shoes off, poured herself
a glass of wine.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.299
Looks like she just got home
from a long day at work.

03:32.342 --> 03:33.604
DANNY:
We got a name yet?

03:33.648 --> 03:36.825
No identification on her,
no phone, nothing.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.261
There must be a name
on the apartment.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.915
There is,
but it's not her apartment.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.004
Whose apartment is it?Name's, uh, Ben Wilson.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.179
He's upstairs.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.920
Good. We'll talk to him.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.798
Ben Wilson.

03:53.842 --> 03:58.150
Detective Reagan,
Detective Baez.

03:58.194 --> 04:01.153
This your place?Yeah. I, uh,

04:01.197 --> 04:03.678
came home, found her,
called 911.

04:03.721 --> 04:06.028
Uh-huh. You came home
from where?

04:06.071 --> 04:07.290
JFK.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.292
British Airways
179 from London,

04:09.336 --> 04:11.729
where I've been on business
the last two weeks.

04:11.773 --> 04:13.949
Ah, okay. Who's the girl?

04:13.992 --> 04:15.298
I have no idea.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.691
What do you mean?
I mean

04:16.734 --> 04:18.127
I've never seen her before
in my life.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.172
You're saying you've never seen
this girl ever,

04:20.216 --> 04:21.304
in your entire life?

04:21.348 --> 04:22.479
Never.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.089
Anyone else have access
to your apartment?

04:24.133 --> 04:26.135
A friend, girlfriend?

04:26.178 --> 04:27.702
No. No one.

04:27.745 --> 04:30.313
I live by myself.
No one else has keys.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.402
So you're telling us that
that is a complete stranger

04:32.446 --> 04:34.578
lying dead in your apartment
downstairs?

04:34.622 --> 04:36.798
That's exactly what
I'm telling you, Detective.

04:41.585 --> 04:44.588
♪

05:03.259 --> 05:04.782
I don't see what
the problem is.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.741
We have Ms. Dowd on video,
driving to and from the robbery.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.091
Under duress
because of her husband.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.049
Doesn't look that way
in the surveillance tape.

05:11.093 --> 05:14.357
I have another tape
that might change your mind.

05:14.401 --> 05:17.142
SHELLY :
No, Mike. Please.

05:17.186 --> 05:20.232
MIKE: You're driving me,
or I'll kill you.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.625
Don't you dare
screw this up for me.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.584
She could've gone
to the cops.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.629
It's not that simple.Sorry, but no deal.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.065
It must happen a lot.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.458
I'm sorry?

05:28.502 --> 05:31.026
He must threaten you a lot
if you're recording him.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.857
She's made
half a dozen tapes like this.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.641
Has he ever cashed in
on those threats?

05:37.685 --> 05:39.034
Yes.I have pictures

05:39.077 --> 05:40.427
from the hospital

05:40.470 --> 05:42.298
of what he's done to her.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.833
This still doesn't
excuse driving your...

05:57.182 --> 05:59.271
So why not just go to the cops?

05:59.315 --> 06:02.187
Because of what
he'll do to our son.

06:04.102 --> 06:05.930
You're really thinking
about letting her walk?

06:05.974 --> 06:08.672
She acted under duress.
It's a non-starter.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.065
At-at least give me a shot.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.719
A shot at what?

06:11.762 --> 06:13.895
More grief than she's
already been through?

06:13.938 --> 06:15.810
I thought we were
the prosecutors here.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.638
And it's our responsibility
to seek out justice,

06:17.681 --> 06:19.248
not just more convictions.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.597
But she aided an armed robbery.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.252
We are dropping the charges,
and that's final.

06:28.039 --> 06:31.521
I can call a press conference,
or I can make you available

06:31.565 --> 06:34.045
to a select few, but
it's not gonna matter.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.091
They've all got
the same question.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.875
Where were the cops
in the poorer neighborhoods?

06:37.919 --> 06:42.010
And in the poorer neighborhoods
would be the answer.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.404
Not exactly.
Not on the Lower East Side.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.015
There's also evidence
of gerrymandered deployment.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.712
Where?

06:48.756 --> 06:50.279
Specifically,
the Vladeck Houses.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.455
Every small business owner
in a ten-block radius

06:52.499 --> 06:54.109
is cursing our name

06:54.152 --> 06:56.546
to any media outlet
that'll listen.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.548
Which would be all of them.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.898
Exactly. And there's threats
from the community.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.465
What kind of threats?They knocked
the headlights

07:02.509 --> 07:05.773
out of a dozen patrol cars
in the 15th this morning.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.905
Oh, great. Blacking us out.
Cute, huh?

07:07.949 --> 07:11.474
There truth to any of this?

07:11.518 --> 07:13.215
Of course not.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.260
Well, the public doesn't
understand our protocol.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.262
GORMLEY:
Which was followed to a T

07:17.306 --> 07:19.917
by our more than qualified
borough commanders.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.092
And we're sure of this how?

07:21.136 --> 07:22.746
It's a population-based
system.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.444
Science, not art.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.446
Nothing personal,
nothing biased.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.839
That's a guess, not a fact.
I want a 49

07:28.883 --> 07:32.060
on the manpower deployments
for Manhattan South.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.062
Hopefully, that will show
that the areas

07:34.105 --> 07:37.587
with the highest population
densities were served first.

07:40.634 --> 07:43.593
You want me to undermine
Chief Russo?

07:43.637 --> 07:46.509
No, I want you to make sure
the protocols were followed.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.686
You undermine a leader from
above, he's dead as a leader.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.518
Russo's a friend of yours.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.042
Yes. But more importantly,
he's a great cop.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.131
Let's find out if he was
last night.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.656
Just because a couple
of citizens are throwing a fit

08:02.699 --> 08:05.746
doesn't mean we should go
question a chief's judgment.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.400
To be fair, it's more like
a few dozen citizens.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.054
Just saying.

08:10.098 --> 08:12.404
Boss, you and I both know
you've been waiting

08:12.448 --> 08:14.319
for your window
to change this policy.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.625
This has nothing
to do with that.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.801
Well, I just wouldn't
want to see a good cop

08:17.845 --> 08:21.022
get caught in a grinder
making that change happen.

08:22.545 --> 08:25.287
Neither would I.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.518
JANKO: He waits till
the early hours of the morning,

08:38.561 --> 08:40.084
looking for women
who've been drinking

08:40.128 --> 08:41.912
and walking home alone.Yeah, yeah.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.784
We get it. So he can
grab their handbag.

08:43.827 --> 08:46.047
Well, that's not all.
He assaults them.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.570
He goes straight for skin,

08:47.614 --> 08:49.354
first on top, then on bottom.

08:49.398 --> 08:50.660
Didn't you patent that move?

08:52.096 --> 08:53.054
Not funny.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.708
Lighten up, sunshine.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.492
He doesn't stop there.
He calls them names,

08:56.536 --> 08:58.712
then he grabs their belongings
and runs.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.801
It's not your typical
street robbery.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.803
So you're saying that all this
is the same guy?

09:02.846 --> 09:04.152
Exactly.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.415
Good luck with that.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.158
DAVIS:
Officer Janko?

09:10.201 --> 09:11.551
Yeah?

09:11.594 --> 09:13.422
Detective Davis
from BRAM Unit.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.728
I, uh...

09:14.771 --> 09:17.252
I overheard the good work
you've been doing.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.167
You did?Sounds like a pattern

09:19.210 --> 09:21.169
to me, too.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.692
Why don't you, uh...

09:22.736 --> 09:24.564
why don't you
tell me more about it.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.479
Okay.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.612
CHATWAL:
So, her husband

09:29.656 --> 09:31.875
yells at her, and you
want to let her walk?

09:31.919 --> 09:33.964
He threatened their son's life,

09:34.008 --> 09:35.879
not to mention
all the physical abuse.

09:35.923 --> 09:38.273
Did he put a gun to her head
and force her behind the wheel?

09:38.316 --> 09:40.318
He might as well have.No.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.712
He put it to the owner
of that bodega's head instead.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.409
She committed that crime
under duress.

09:44.453 --> 09:48.588
I have a legal and ethical
responsibility not to prosecute.

09:48.631 --> 09:52.069
You have a professional one
to try.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.680
Your actions reflect

09:53.723 --> 09:55.333
directly on this office now.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.469
Mistakes included.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.558
What happened?

10:04.647 --> 10:07.215
She got arrested again?

10:07.258 --> 10:08.433
Shortly after her release.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.827
This time for selling drugs
to a minor.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.263
She has no history with drugs.

10:12.307 --> 10:15.136
That makes no sense.

10:15.179 --> 10:18.618
Why would she risk a second
chance to be with her son?

10:18.661 --> 10:20.620
Erin, I know where
your heart is.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.665
Really, I do.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.102
It's bleeding on your sleeve
for all to see.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.887
But you need to stop
playing defense attorney

10:26.930 --> 10:30.020
and start prosecuting.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.331
Right over here.

10:36.374 --> 10:37.462
Hey.

10:37.506 --> 10:40.335
Hey. Still waiting
on DNA from the lab.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.336
Who's this?

10:41.379 --> 10:42.816
This is Evan Walker.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.732
He was filing a missing person's
with the desk sergeant.

10:45.775 --> 10:48.430
Description he gave sounded
similar to our Jane Doe.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.040
Oh.

10:50.084 --> 10:53.043
Take a look at her.
Tell me if you recognize her.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.441
:
Oh, my God.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.964
Who is it?

11:01.008 --> 11:02.444
Michelle.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.054
Michelle who?

11:04.098 --> 11:06.056
Hopper.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.015
M-My fiancée.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.061
She's dead?

11:11.105 --> 11:13.324
I'm so sorry. Yes.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.635
What happened?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.071
We're trying to figure that out.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.334
But we need your help
in order to do that.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.467
When's the last time
you spoke with her?

11:25.510 --> 11:28.992
I don't know.
Uh, maybe t

11:29.036 --> 11:31.168
Two days ago.
What'd you two talk about?

11:31.212 --> 11:32.692
Nothing important.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.345
Who did this to her?

11:34.389 --> 11:35.999
We don't know yet.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.479
Did she mention
anyone threatening her?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.002
Anything unusual?

11:39.046 --> 11:40.525
No.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.223
What was Michelle
doing in the city?

11:42.266 --> 11:45.835
She was in town for some,
uh, job interviews,

11:45.879 --> 11:47.837
and she just got an offer.

11:47.881 --> 11:51.754
I flew in from Ohio
to, uh, surprise her.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.364
We were gonna, uh, move here.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.540
The, uh,

11:55.584 --> 11:59.719
apartment she was staying in
belonged to a Ben Wilson.

11:59.762 --> 12:00.720
Do you know him?

12:00.763 --> 12:02.896
Ben.Ben Wilson.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.767
Yeah.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.595
Yeah, I talked to him.

12:06.638 --> 12:07.901
You did?

12:07.944 --> 12:09.859
I arranged for her
to stay at his apartment

12:09.903 --> 12:11.208
through House Swap.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.906
House Swap?

12:12.949 --> 12:15.082
It's an app. You can, uh,
rent people's apartments

12:15.125 --> 12:16.300
when they're out of town.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.737
Okay. So this Ben Wilson knew

12:17.780 --> 12:19.477
that she was staying
at his place?

12:19.521 --> 12:20.914
We exchanged half a dozen
e-mails about it.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.437
You have proof of those e

12:24.700 --> 12:26.310
Just take it.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.324
So you're going forward
with the robbery charges?

12:40.368 --> 12:42.674
In light
of these new charges, yes.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.154
Are you at least going
to offer us a deal,

12:44.198 --> 12:45.634
considering the duress?My office

12:45.677 --> 12:46.809
will be pursuing this case

12:46.853 --> 12:48.855
to the fullest extent
of the law.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.204
Then there's nothing more
to discuss.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.251
I thought
you cared about your son.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.166
I do. He-He's all I care about.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.690
Then why would you put yourself
at risk again?

12:58.734 --> 12:59.996
I...

13:00.040 --> 13:01.432
I don't know.

13:01.476 --> 13:02.738
You think
he's gonna accept that

13:02.782 --> 13:04.044
as an answer when he's older?

13:04.087 --> 13:06.220
He'll thank me.For not being around?

13:06.263 --> 13:07.874
For not having to grow up
in foster care

13:07.917 --> 13:09.963
like I did.How is going to prison
gonna keep him

13:10.006 --> 13:11.442
out of foster care?

13:11.486 --> 13:13.531
Because if...

13:16.360 --> 13:18.841
What are you not telling me?

13:20.712 --> 13:23.454
Can you give us a deal
on the robbery charges?

13:23.498 --> 13:24.629
If I could?

13:24.673 --> 13:26.588
We'd need a guarantee.

13:28.372 --> 13:31.636
I need to know
the information first.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.117
Then we have nothing else
to say.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.175
Ten-hut!

13:53.920 --> 13:55.269
At ease.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.879
You all look

13:56.923 --> 13:58.402
like crap.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.578
Been a long night, huh?

14:00.622 --> 14:02.537
Thank you for
your good work.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.104
I need each one of you

14:04.147 --> 14:06.715
to relay your patrol posts
from the blackout.

14:06.758 --> 14:07.890
Starting at this end.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.196
Patrol Post 1.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.720
West side of Orchard Street,
Broome to Delancey.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.722
Patrol Post 3.
North side of Essex Street,

14:13.765 --> 14:15.158
Stanton to Houston.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.551
Very good.Patrol Post 2.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.161
South Orchard Street.Nice.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.163
Patrol Post 6. Grand Street.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.904
Patrol Post 5.
Seward Park.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.558
Patrol Post 8.
East Broadway.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.125
Rutgers
to Montgomery.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.474
Mm-hmm.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.824
Anybody assigned
to Madison Street?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.130
By the Vladeck Houses?

14:31.261 --> 14:32.219
Oh, come on.

14:32.262 --> 14:33.524
No one?

14:33.568 --> 14:34.917
SARACENO:
I sent

14:34.961 --> 14:37.398
a few guys home
after an 18-hour tour.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.748
Just the ones patrolling
the Vladeck Houses?

14:39.791 --> 14:42.055
Um, I'd have to check that.I'm gonna need

14:42.098 --> 14:44.231
to see your duty rosters
from the blackout.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.929
Yeah, of course.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.801
Thank you, Officers.

15:03.859 --> 15:04.947
Commissioner, sir.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.776
As you were, Captain.

15:09.299 --> 15:12.302
Can I ask,
what's this about?

15:12.346 --> 15:14.739
I think you know
what this is about.

15:14.783 --> 15:18.134
I heard some patrol cars
were vandalized this morning.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.788
Well, with all due respect, sir,

15:19.831 --> 15:22.834
that's not really anything
out of the ordinary down here.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.272
I heard it's linked
to the Vladeck Houses.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.969
The majority of the crime
we see down here

15:27.013 --> 15:28.362
can be linked to those projects.

15:28.405 --> 15:31.278
I am talking about what happened
in this instance.

15:31.321 --> 15:34.498
I'm talking about a reaction
to a lack of police coverage

15:34.542 --> 15:37.023
during the blackout.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.546
I'm sorry, sir.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.504
I, uh...

15:44.073 --> 15:46.380
If you've got something
to share,

15:46.423 --> 15:48.904
I suggest you share it.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.518
I was just following orders.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.783
Whose orders?

16:01.873 --> 16:06.008
Chief Russo contacted me
right after the lights went out.

16:08.358 --> 16:12.014
Told me to focus
our deployment on...

16:12.058 --> 16:14.103
certain neighborhoods.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.019
You saying he had a list?

16:21.023 --> 16:24.244
More or less.

16:29.684 --> 16:30.902
I've never even
used House Swap.

16:30.946 --> 16:33.122
Really?

16:33.166 --> 16:35.124
Then whose profile is that?

16:35.168 --> 16:36.517
I have no idea.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.605
That's your apartment, isn't it?

16:37.648 --> 16:38.693
Yes.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.129
But the building
has strict policies

16:40.173 --> 16:42.523
against subletting
and extended stays.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.612
Well, then how come there are
a half dozen other apartments

16:44.655 --> 16:45.787
on the app?

16:45.830 --> 16:46.831
I have no idea.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.181
Then get one.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.705
Look, Detective,
I make real money.

16:50.748 --> 16:53.099
I don't need to rent
my apartment out.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.274
Uh-huh.I never talked

16:54.317 --> 16:56.537
to this... what's his name.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.408
Evan.Evan.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.584
But you e-mailed with him.I never e-mailed with him.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.370
Really?

17:03.413 --> 17:05.589
Then how do you explain that?

17:05.633 --> 17:07.983
That's not my
e-mail address.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.419
Oh, my God. You're
a real slick character.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.813
Got an alibi
for everything, don't you?Look,

17:11.856 --> 17:13.119
Detective,

17:13.162 --> 17:15.251
I can afford a serious lawyer,

17:15.295 --> 17:17.471
and I haven't asked for one.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.473
I don't know this Evan.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.910
I don't know
who made this profile.

17:21.953 --> 17:25.348
I do know it wasn't me.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.706
What else
is there to tell?

17:35.750 --> 17:37.839
Shelly copped
to the charges.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.537
A little too easily,
if you ask me.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.108
Lisa Dowd?

17:46.152 --> 17:48.241
Yes.Hi.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.113
A.D.A. Erin Reagan. This
is Detective Abetemarco.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.767
Just wondering if we could
ask you a few questions

17:52.810 --> 17:54.247
about your
daughter-in-law.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.597
Well, I-I already told
the police everything.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.165
We just want to make sure
we got our facts straight.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.427
Oh, fine.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.950
Certainly. Um...

18:01.993 --> 18:04.344
So, Shelly came here
after she was released?

18:04.387 --> 18:06.346
Uh, yes. Asking me for money.

18:06.389 --> 18:07.564
Again.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.871
I take it you
didn't give her any.No.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.090
No, of course not.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.570
Um, we got into an argument.

18:13.614 --> 18:14.963
And the next thing
I know,

18:15.006 --> 18:16.791
I see her out
in the school parking lot,

18:16.834 --> 18:18.662
selling pills to students.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.143
And you saw her

18:21.187 --> 18:22.971
selling drugs from here?

18:23.014 --> 18:24.407
Well, I could see
the body language.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.105
I knew what
she was doing.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.368
Sh-She was
desperate for money.

18:28.411 --> 18:30.152
That's quite a leap.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.850
Well, they found the pills
on her, didn't they?

18:32.894 --> 18:34.330
Has she done anything
like this before?

18:34.374 --> 18:35.984
Anything like this?

18:36.027 --> 18:37.246
Um,

18:37.290 --> 18:39.379
practically every move
she makes.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.163
My son deserves better.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.599
And your grandson?

18:42.643 --> 18:43.861
Yes. Yes.

18:43.905 --> 18:46.081
She's not fit
to take care of him.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.214
Who's taking care of him now?

18:48.257 --> 18:49.998
I-I am. I am.

18:50.041 --> 18:54.089
I'm the only... free and
responsible family member left.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.395
Okay. Well, great.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.092
Thank you
for your time.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.486
Sorry for wasting yours.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.705
How-how did you
hurt your arm?

19:01.749 --> 19:05.274
Oh, I-I started biking again,
for the workout.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.276
And I broke
my collarbone

19:07.320 --> 19:09.322
getting run off the road.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.324
I did that in college.
It hurts like hell.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.282
They give you anything?

19:13.326 --> 19:14.718
Well, I never filled out
the prescription.

19:14.762 --> 19:17.634
I-I would rather live
with the pain than that fog.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.201
Yeah, I understand.
Well, thank you again.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.681
And I hope you feel better.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.596
Thank you.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.169
You were right.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.822
The pills Shelly
was caught with

19:31.866 --> 19:34.042
traced back to her
mother-in-law's prescription.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.217
She planted them.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.697
Looks like it.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.830
And all this just to get custody
of her grandson?

19:39.874 --> 19:41.528
But why wouldn't Shelly
fight the charges?

19:41.571 --> 19:43.704
To keep her son out
of foster care.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.184
If her mother-in-law
goes into prison,

19:45.227 --> 19:46.707
then the whole family's
in the system.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.752
So now Shelly can walk.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.755
No, she can't. I mean,
the drug charges will go away,

19:51.799 --> 19:53.844
but the robbery charges
will stay.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.411
You're not gonna drop 'em?

19:55.455 --> 19:57.718
I have direct orders
to prosecute.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.676
Since when have orders
stopped you?

19:59.720 --> 20:02.157
Since they've been coming
straight from the D.A.,

20:02.201 --> 20:05.726
complete with sarcasm
and not-so-veiled threats.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.858
So Shelly's stuck.

20:08.946 --> 20:09.904
Yes.

20:09.947 --> 20:13.037
And so is her son.

20:16.954 --> 20:19.087
Allen Castillo.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.610
Doorman,

20:20.654 --> 20:23.265
165 East 7th Street.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.440
Is that right?

20:24.484 --> 20:25.702
Yes, sir.You probably know

20:25.746 --> 20:27.269
your tenants
pretty well then.

20:27.313 --> 20:28.923
Some of them I do.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.359
What about Ben Wilson?
You know him?

20:30.403 --> 20:32.796
I know him. But no
better than the rest.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.711
No, I think you know him
very well.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.452
What do you mean?Well, Mr. Wilson

20:36.496 --> 20:38.802
has a profile
on the House Swap app.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.457
The number and the e-mail
on the account

20:41.501 --> 20:43.111
are the same number and e-mail

20:43.154 --> 20:44.547
used on the accounts

20:44.591 --> 20:45.940
of other tenants
in your building

20:45.983 --> 20:48.464
who happen to have profiles
on that app as well.

20:48.508 --> 20:51.075
And when I ran the number,

20:51.119 --> 20:52.207
guess where they led me to.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.909
It was just to make
some extra cash on the side.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.391
What happened to Michelle?

21:02.435 --> 21:03.697
I don't know, I swear.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.307
You knew she was staying there.I was renting

21:05.351 --> 21:07.309
my tenants' apartments,
but I'd never murder anyone.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.832
Except this time.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.791
The power went out, and you
knew the security cameras

21:10.834 --> 21:12.532
would be down.When the power
went out,

21:12.575 --> 21:14.751
I was at home,
helping my family.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.753
Our power took twice as long
to come back on.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.929
Right. So you were home
with your family.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.061
My family,
my neighbors' families--

21:20.104 --> 21:21.323
they can all vouch for me.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.846
Hope so.
I'll be paying them a visit.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.413
Who else would have access
to the apartment?

21:24.457 --> 21:26.241
Maybe somebody you
rented it to before,

21:26.285 --> 21:28.896
maybe they had copies
of the keys made?

21:28.939 --> 21:30.550
This is the first time
I rented it.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.334
Ben never left town
long enough before.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.641
Before what?He and his girlfriend split up.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.556
Ben had a girlfriend?

21:36.599 --> 21:39.385
A nightmare of one.
They used to fight all the time.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.647
Uh-huh.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.649
And things ended bad?

21:42.692 --> 21:44.694
Horrible. Their last fight
spilled into the hallways.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.696
I almost had to call the cops.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.133
That was the last time
I ever saw her.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.009
JANKO:
So, are we the kind of couple

21:55.052 --> 21:57.403
that talks about the office,
or do we leave

21:57.446 --> 21:59.187
the office talk
back at the office?

21:59.230 --> 22:01.407
Actually, I did want to talk
to you about something.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.843
Okay.I heard about

22:02.886 --> 22:04.018
the undercover assignment

22:04.061 --> 22:05.628
that Detective Davis
wants you to work.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.108
It's a great opportunity, right?

22:07.151 --> 22:08.979
I don't think you should do it.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.851
What?I think you should steer clear

22:10.894 --> 22:12.592
of Davis
and the undercover assignment.

22:12.635 --> 22:15.072
Uh, why would I do that?

22:15.116 --> 22:17.161
Eddie, it's dangerous.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.380
Well, I think
it's more dangerous

22:18.424 --> 22:19.816
having that guy
out on the street.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.383
And we'll get him,
but not like this.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.863
I don't think so.
I'm perfect for this.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.734
I fit the profile
of every one of his victims.

22:26.606 --> 22:29.783
Wait, is this, like...
an order?

22:29.826 --> 22:31.262
No. I wanted to tell you here,

22:31.306 --> 22:33.308
because I didn't want
to muddy the waters like that.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.050
Okay. Good.But I am your sergeant.

22:36.093 --> 22:38.748
I'm aware.And I respect your judgment.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.533
Well, my judgment says
I gotta work this case.

22:40.576 --> 22:41.882
"Gotta"Do you have

22:41.925 --> 22:43.884
any idea how many times
I've walked home

22:43.927 --> 22:46.234
late at night alone,
couple of drinks in me?

22:46.277 --> 22:47.496
How many time I've thought
maybe this is it,

22:47.540 --> 22:49.542
tonight's the night
I become the victim?

22:49.585 --> 22:51.370
So you make yourself a victim?

22:51.413 --> 22:55.025
The answer is:
no, you don't know.I don't see why

22:55.069 --> 22:56.113
you should hang yourself
out there

22:56.157 --> 22:57.550
like a piece of bait
for some creep.

22:57.593 --> 22:58.855
Of course you don't,
because you've never been afraid

22:58.899 --> 23:01.205
to walk home alone at night.
You have no idea

23:01.249 --> 23:03.033
what that feels like.I'm not saying I do.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.252
Well, then...

23:04.295 --> 23:07.342
respectfully, back off.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.039
All right. Fine.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.737
You know what, you do
whatever you want.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.260
You know,
you could just be supportive.

23:12.303 --> 23:13.566
I can't be supportive of Davis.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.915
Because I think he's reckless.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.090
And I've been
clocking his work

23:16.133 --> 23:17.134
since before you came
to the precinct.

23:17.178 --> 23:18.440
Okay, so you're afraid for me,

23:18.484 --> 23:19.963
so now you're
gonna blame it on Davis?No.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.182
That's not it.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.705
You're better than this.

23:22.749 --> 23:24.185
And you're smarter than this.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.366
You know, I'm gonna sleep
at mine tonight.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.672
Thanks for dinner.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.473
Not five minutes
after the lights go out,

23:51.517 --> 23:53.475
my cell goes off--
restricted caller, it says.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.998
I never pick those up.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.870
Well, neither do I,
but it's a blackout.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.393
What am I supposed to do?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.310
It's the mayor.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.704
Exactly. And she's got,
like, this shopping list

24:04.747 --> 24:07.097
of blocks where she
wants extra manpower.

24:07.141 --> 24:08.795
And it's the mayor--
you can't exactly...

24:08.838 --> 24:10.884
Exactly. So I say,
"Thank you, Madam Mayor.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.320
I'll get right on it."

24:12.363 --> 24:14.148
I mean, what
else could I do?

24:14.191 --> 24:15.497
She says, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"

24:15.541 --> 24:17.151
And if I say,
"No, this has to go

24:17.194 --> 24:18.457
through the PC,"
what am I doing?

24:18.500 --> 24:20.807
Throwing the PC
into the wood chipper.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.243
Exactly.

24:22.286 --> 24:25.725
Except that the blocks
around the Vladek Houses...

24:26.856 --> 24:27.944
Yes.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.380
That's the problem.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.034
It's all a
problem, Sid.

24:31.078 --> 24:32.775
But what am I gonna do,
tell the mayor

24:32.819 --> 24:34.516
that there's these
Dollar Stores and bodegas

24:34.560 --> 24:36.997
that take precedent
over her donors and her cronies?

24:37.040 --> 24:38.259
I mean, we all serve

24:38.302 --> 24:40.304
at the pleasure of the mayor,
am I right?

24:40.348 --> 24:42.002
:
Pretty much.

24:42.045 --> 24:44.395
Plus, I'm saving the boss
this headache.

24:44.439 --> 24:47.398
You did the right thing, Vinny.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.662
Under the circumstances.

24:49.705 --> 24:52.273
You got my back on this, right?

24:53.666 --> 24:56.146
I got your back, Vinny.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.235
And he's nothing if not fair.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.545
How many blocks?

25:03.589 --> 25:04.546
Just a few.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.721
What's a few?

25:05.765 --> 25:07.680
Ten, 13.

25:07.723 --> 25:08.811
Which is it?

25:08.855 --> 25:10.334
Maybe 15.

25:10.378 --> 25:15.035
So, you left one of the most
dangerous housing projects

25:15.078 --> 25:18.691
in this city
totally unsupervised.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.736
Not totally, sir.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.043
But definitely undermanned.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.740
Yes. Definitely.

25:24.784 --> 25:25.567
Regrettably.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.917
Yes. But it was the mayor.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.531
My thought process, sir,
if I may?

25:32.574 --> 25:34.097
It was either me taking the heat

25:34.141 --> 25:36.578
or kicking it up to you
and handing you the headache,

25:36.622 --> 25:38.580
and I think
I made the right choice.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.540
You think?

25:42.628 --> 25:44.455
I hope.

25:44.499 --> 25:47.023
So you think it's your job

25:47.067 --> 25:49.373
to step out
of the chain of command,

25:49.417 --> 25:53.595
break protocol, in order
to save me from a headache?

25:53.639 --> 25:55.728
Well, no, you put it that way.

25:55.771 --> 25:57.338
You got another way to put it?

25:57.381 --> 26:01.734
We all serve
at the pleasure of the mayor.

26:01.777 --> 26:04.737
Well, you got that wrong.

26:11.091 --> 26:14.747
And we both serve
all the people of this city,

not just the ones
with a hook at City Hall.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.104
Yes, sir.

26:26.323 --> 26:28.238
That's all.

26:44.559 --> 26:47.518
Boss, he-he was in a tough spot.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.346
You know?
And it was the mayor.

26:49.390 --> 26:52.262
It was not like a favor
he could call the chips in.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.787

are not in the mix here, Sid.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.310

26:56.353 --> 26:59.313

certainly not by this fiasco.

Okay. Suppose the president
calls you directly

27:02.490 --> 27:04.927
and asks you for a favor,
you gonna do it?

27:04.971 --> 27:06.712
If I can.Well, that's all Vinny did.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.409
But only if it is in bounds.

27:08.452 --> 27:11.281
All right. I know
you'd like to think that.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.328
What's thatmean?

27:14.371 --> 27:16.417
Actually, I take it back.
You canthink that way,

27:16.460 --> 27:17.940
'cause you'd
probably get away with it.

27:17.984 --> 27:20.508
I don't try to get away
with stuff, Sid.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.162

Boss, I've watched you
up close for years.

You've got something
the rest of us don't.

be my boss.

30:17.728 --> 30:18.729
Me, too.Yeah,

30:18.773 --> 30:19.992
not exactly the same.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.689
FRANK:
Hey.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.691
Any time you want
to talk about it.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.693
But it'd have to be
pretty convincing

30:25.736 --> 30:29.479
to pull an ace off the field
and park him behind a desk.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.351
Shucks, Dad.

30:31.394 --> 30:32.569
That's right, Ace.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.746
Wow.

30:39.925 --> 30:43.058
Where's her motherShe was arrested this morning

30:43.102 --> 30:45.669
for planting the drugs
and framing your client.

30:45.713 --> 30:46.801
KEVIN:
So the drug charges

30:46.845 --> 30:48.107
against my client
have been dropped?

30:48.150 --> 30:49.369
That's correct.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.284
And the charges
for abetting the robbery?

30:53.460 --> 30:54.591
Are they dropped?

30:54.635 --> 30:57.638
My office will be proceeding

30:57.681 --> 30:58.857
with the prosecution.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.684
My husband threatened
my son's life.

31:00.728 --> 31:02.512
I thought you understood that.

31:02.556 --> 31:06.168
A judge and jury will decide
if you were under duress.

31:06.212 --> 31:08.736
And until then, wh...
what happens to my son?

31:08.779 --> 31:10.042
He will be picked up

31:10.085 --> 31:11.870
from the neighbor's house

31:11.913 --> 31:14.655
by the Administration
for Child Services.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.135
So he's going to foster care.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.920
Pending the outcome
of this case. That's correct.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.182
This is why

31:20.226 --> 31:21.749
I didn't come forward
about the drugs.

31:21.792 --> 31:24.534
This is the one thing that
I didn't want to happen.

31:26.449 --> 31:29.278
Why are you doing this to us?

31:33.239 --> 31:35.806
I'm sorry.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.991
You didn't think to mention
your ex

31:46.034 --> 31:47.340
Clarissa?
Yeah, Clarissa.

31:47.383 --> 31:48.732
She doesn't matter.

31:48.776 --> 31:50.604
Of course she matters;
you told us nobody else

31:50.647 --> 31:51.953
had access to
this apartment.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.433
And I was telling the truth.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.565
BAEZ: Castillo said she
practically lived here.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.002
Trust me, no way

31:57.045 --> 31:59.178
I was letting her keep
those keys when we broke up.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.179
Because she's dangerous?

32:00.222 --> 32:02.398
No. Just controlling.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.226
Had a hard time letting go.

32:04.270 --> 32:06.925
Really? Where the hell
does she live now?

32:06.968 --> 32:10.363
You guys really think she had
something to do with this?

32:10.406 --> 32:11.625
Just tell us where.

32:11.668 --> 32:12.800
Look, Clarissa's crazy,

32:12.843 --> 32:14.280
but there's no way
she murdered someone,

32:14.323 --> 32:16.412
especially not some
random woman.A random woman,

32:16.456 --> 32:18.675
living in her ex-boyfriend's
apartment,

32:18.719 --> 32:20.764
with an engagement ring
on her finger.

32:20.808 --> 32:23.724
Now tell us where
the hell she lives.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.360
♪

33:03.068 --> 33:04.983
♪

33:24.350 --> 33:26.265
♪

33:44.587 --> 33:46.502
♪

34:07.219 --> 34:09.525
Give me the bag, slut.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.398
You think this is a game, huh?

34:13.747 --> 34:14.835
No. No.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.793
Stop. No.

34:16.837 --> 34:19.057
Oh.

34:27.326 --> 34:28.414
Give me your hands.
Give me 'em.

34:28.457 --> 34:29.458
Give me your hands.

34:29.502 --> 34:30.720
All right. Move it. Move in.

34:30.764 --> 34:33.114
JAMIE:
Come on. Back.

34:33.158 --> 34:36.204
All right. We got 'em.Sergeant Reagan, what the hell?

34:36.248 --> 34:40.078
Hey, you fall asleep?!
You fall asleep?

34:40.121 --> 34:42.428
I had to get him on
the assault charge.

34:42.471 --> 34:44.517
No, you didn't. You had him
on attempted robbery.

34:44.560 --> 34:45.779
Not enough.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.128
JAMIE: Which is
enough to get him

34:47.172 --> 34:48.695
in the lineup,
which is all you needed.

34:50.827 --> 34:52.699
Are you okay?

34:52.742 --> 34:54.222
JamieOn your feet. You all right?

34:54.266 --> 34:56.268
What are you doing...

34:56.311 --> 34:58.400
What are you doing here?

34:59.967 --> 35:01.925
What are you doing

35:01.969 --> 35:03.275
Are you okay?
Yeah.

35:20.727 --> 35:23.991
You know what? I should've
told Ben not to call Clarissa.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.645
Why would Ben
call Clarissa?

35:25.688 --> 35:27.255
To tip her off.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.344
It's his ex, why would
he tip off his ex?

35:29.388 --> 35:31.216
He was with her for years.

35:31.259 --> 35:33.043
Yeah, and he said
she was crazy.
Yet...

35:33.087 --> 35:35.045
There's no reason for
him to tip her off....he still dated her.

35:35.089 --> 35:37.831
And then there were
probably booty calls.

35:37.874 --> 35:41.661
I mean, toxic relationships
like that never just end.

35:41.704 --> 35:42.836
Huh.

35:42.879 --> 35:44.533
Maybe you should call Ben

35:44.577 --> 35:46.274
and tell him not to
tip off Clarissa.

35:59.461 --> 36:01.333
Anything?

36:01.376 --> 36:02.551
Straight to voice mail.

36:02.595 --> 36:03.813
Great.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.554
I'd love to know what
this Clarissa knows

36:05.598 --> 36:07.513
before we knock
on her door.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.708
You're good to go, Officer.

36:28.751 --> 36:29.709
Thanks.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.675
Let's just forget
about it, okay?

36:39.719 --> 36:42.025
Would it really have been so bad
to just take my advice?

36:42.069 --> 36:43.940
You were being overprotective.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.638
It's my job to protect you.

36:45.681 --> 36:48.206
As my sergeant or as my fiancé?

36:50.469 --> 36:51.644
In this case, as your sergeant.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.429
I call BS.
You got to choose.

36:54.473 --> 36:57.737
Because we agreed that we would
separate work from home.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.260
I wouldn't let any of
my officers go undercover

36:59.304 --> 37:00.522
with Detective Davis.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.307
Jamie, you lost your
judgment because of me.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.877
It's exactly what we
said we weren't gonna do.

37:07.921 --> 37:09.270
I'm still gonna
have your back, Eddie.

37:09.314 --> 37:10.793
Jamie, I was fine without you.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.578
You couldn't see
the next ten seconds.

37:12.621 --> 37:13.883
You don't know
what might've been next,

37:13.927 --> 37:15.537
and Davis was waiting
on assault.

37:22.805 --> 37:24.720
Jamie, I'm fine.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.029
Well, thank God.

37:49.136 --> 37:50.920
BAEZ:
This is Detective Baez.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.183
I have a jumper in front of
412 Meyers Street.

37:53.227 --> 37:56.186
I'm gonna need an MLI
at this location.

38:02.149 --> 38:03.498
No.

38:03.542 --> 38:04.760
Hey, Ben. Hey.

38:04.804 --> 38:06.196
Hey! Hey!What!

38:06.240 --> 38:07.720
Slow down,
don't go any closer.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.504
It's Clarissa?
It's Clarissa.
Yeah.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.853
She...

38:10.897 --> 38:12.333
Apparently, she jumped.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.379
I called her.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.294
I told her I knew all
the best lawyers.

38:16.337 --> 38:17.860
I told her not to freak out.

38:17.904 --> 38:20.210
There's nothing you can do
about it now, okay?

38:20.254 --> 38:21.429
It's too late.

38:21.473 --> 38:24.563
There's nothing
you can do for her.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.349
It's not your fault, Ben.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.525
Then whose?

38:32.266 --> 38:34.964
Oh, God.

38:52.286 --> 38:55.245
A.D.A. Reagan,

38:55.289 --> 38:57.378
congratulations on
unraveling the Dowd case.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.381
Those detective genes
really paid off.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.644
I'm not sure congratulations
is in order here.

39:02.688 --> 39:03.645
Of course it is.

39:03.689 --> 39:05.430
Shelly was threatened

39:05.473 --> 39:07.083
and abused by her husband,

39:07.127 --> 39:08.911
and set up by
her mother-in-law.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.783
But she was no saint.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.698
Doesn't make her
a criminal, either.

39:12.741 --> 39:17.398
You are still planning
to prosecute, correct?

39:17.442 --> 39:20.053
No. I can't.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.968
You can't?If I have to compromise

39:22.011 --> 39:24.927
what's right to do this job,
then I don't belong here.

39:24.971 --> 39:27.365
Well, perhaps you could
consider the greater good.

39:27.408 --> 39:29.584
Consider what it will do
to this office

39:29.628 --> 39:31.238
once this story
hits the press.

39:31.281 --> 39:34.284
Any decent reporter's gonna see

39:34.328 --> 39:36.112
that Shelly is the victim here.

39:36.156 --> 39:39.202
Or that she is the Bonnie
to her husband's Clyde.

39:39.246 --> 39:40.465
They're gonna see that she did

39:40.508 --> 39:42.554
what she had to do
to protect her son.

39:42.597 --> 39:45.644
So you think
we should drop the charges?

39:45.687 --> 39:48.560
It's the right thing to do.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.432
Well... I can see

39:51.476 --> 39:54.000
what Monica was dealing with
all these years.

39:55.871 --> 39:58.265
Well, maybe she should
have warned you.

39:58.308 --> 39:59.527
She did.

40:01.268 --> 40:03.836
I took the leap anyway.

40:03.879 --> 40:07.492
Take the leap
with me on this.

40:09.624 --> 40:10.843
You owe me.

40:14.194 --> 40:17.066
And I collect with interest.

40:30.819 --> 40:35.868
Did you think terminating
Chief Russo was a suggestion?

40:35.911 --> 40:36.869
No.

40:36.912 --> 40:39.001
Do I actually have to say...?

40:39.045 --> 40:40.263
That's an order? No.

40:40.307 --> 40:42.657
But you didn't slap an ASAP
on it, either.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.616
Look at me, Sid.

40:47.140 --> 40:50.491
Yes, I thought maybe
you might...

40:50.535 --> 40:53.059
walk in his shoes, reconsider.

40:53.102 --> 40:56.018
Pretty confident
you made a case?

40:56.062 --> 40:58.456
I just figured once in a while
you don't really mean

40:58.499 --> 41:01.459
what you say gets taken like
Moses walked down the mountain

41:01.502 --> 41:03.417
with it chiseled on a tablet.

41:05.593 --> 41:07.682
What the hell's got into you?

41:07.726 --> 41:09.510
Same thing
that was always there.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.120
Same thing you hired me for.

41:11.164 --> 41:12.644
I stick up for our cops

41:12.687 --> 41:15.516
even when everyone else
has fled the scene.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.173
And I don't?

41:20.216 --> 41:24.046
I didn't say that
and I would never say that.

41:27.136 --> 41:31.401
You can offer him a demotion
or early retirement.

41:31.445 --> 41:33.708
A-S-A-P.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.405
Demotion to what?

41:35.449 --> 41:37.669
I don't know; I'm gonna
leave that up to you.

41:37.712 --> 41:40.323
But enough of a demotion
sends a signal to the rest

41:40.367 --> 41:44.023
of the department that those
kind of favors, we do not do,

41:44.066 --> 41:47.766
and if you do them,
you will pay dearly. Copy?

41:47.809 --> 41:49.419
Copy.

41:51.857 --> 41:55.295
And I don't have a Teflon suit.

41:55.338 --> 41:57.297
Everything gets to me.

41:57.340 --> 42:00.082
Every time one of ours is hurt,
or jammed up,

42:00.126 --> 42:04.739
or he's in over his head,
it gets to me.

42:04.783 --> 42:08.526
I just don't show it,
'cause I can't show it,

42:08.569 --> 42:11.311
'cause nobody wants or needs

42:11.354 --> 42:14.488
a "sensitive"
police commissioner.

42:17.099 --> 42:18.274
Okay.

42:18.318 --> 42:20.538
So screw you.

42:20.581 --> 42:22.931
Yes, sir. That an order, too?

42:22.975 --> 42:24.759
Yeah, that's an order.

42:24.803 --> 42:27.936
Screw me-- I'm on it, boss.
