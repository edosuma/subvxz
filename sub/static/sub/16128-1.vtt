00:28.550 --> 00:31.144
Looters. Speculators.

00:31.342 --> 00:32.639
Grave robbers.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.019
This is how Prehistorians 
are perceived.

00:35.175 --> 00:38.349
"The meek shall inherit the Earth."

00:38.550 --> 00:42.635
Not those who arrogantly seek
to explain the miracle of Creation.

00:42.842 --> 00:47.552
But our quest is for
the Origins of Mankind.

00:47.717 --> 00:49.310
Think then of the peril

00:49.467 --> 00:52.971
should your children
be exposed to their heresy.

00:53.175 --> 00:57.260
It is imperative that we raise
the standing of our infant science,

00:57.425 --> 01:00.554
as the great Charles Darwin
has done for Natural History.

01:00.717 --> 01:03.345
Anyone who does not confess

01:03.550 --> 01:06.224
that the world and all things in it...

01:06.383 --> 01:09.592
are created for the glory of God:

01:10.842 --> 01:12.890
let him be anathema,

01:13.342 --> 01:15.219
cast out from the Church.

01:40.842 --> 01:43.140
My name is Maria Sautuola.

01:44.550 --> 01:48.475
When I was nine years old,
my world was torn apart.

01:49.258 --> 01:53.058
Even so, I don't regret 
for what we did,

01:53.467 --> 01:55.140
for what we discover.

01:55.758 --> 01:58.841
It all began when 
Papa went to Paris

01:58.967 --> 02:02.551
to hear the greatest 
archaeologists of the age.

02:03.175 --> 02:06.429
Papa was a scholar and a scientist,

02:06.883 --> 02:11.218
but above all a fearless 
seeker of truth.

02:11.883 --> 02:15.808
Don Marcelino, are we looking
at our primitive ancestors?

02:16.717 --> 02:19.140
Only a few steps from the cave.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.553
I was trying to imagine
how I would behave if my house

02:21.758 --> 02:23.681
were on display like a zoo.

02:25.508 --> 02:26.600
We should go.

02:26.758 --> 02:29.477
The lecture will be packed.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.894
We must be rigorous, methodical,

02:37.008 --> 02:38.760
scientific in our work,

02:38.883 --> 02:41.636
or the forces of Reaction 
will crush us.

02:47.383 --> 02:49.226
Good speech, Cartailhac.

02:49.550 --> 02:52.053
Allow me to introduce my 
friend, Mister Sautuola,

02:52.217 --> 02:54.219
a keen recruit to our field.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.101
Another Jesuit?

02:56.258 --> 02:57.805
No, sir.

02:58.133 --> 03:01.763
A beginner, an enthusiast 
without prejudice.

03:02.050 --> 03:04.473
I'm learning so much
from your journal, sir.

03:05.008 --> 03:07.932
It's men like you 
we academics rely on.

03:08.092 --> 03:11.596
The honest amateur 
is our foot soldier.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.724
Only do not let his 
dogma infect you.

03:18.842 --> 03:20.515
Please, its for you.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.389
Papa, papa.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.302
Be careful with those, Maria.

03:43.925 --> 03:44.972
Mero!

03:49.758 --> 03:52.432
Oh, Marcelino, is that a hat?

03:52.842 --> 03:54.185
From Paris?

03:54.383 --> 03:56.886
- Yes... I mean, no.
- Thank you.

03:57.050 --> 03:58.552
Forgive me, Conchita!

03:58.717 --> 04:00.685
It's for my orchid collection and...

04:01.300 --> 04:02.973
I shall wear it to church?

04:03.133 --> 04:05.761
See what my husband 
has brought from Paris.

04:06.258 --> 04:09.011
We are joining Cartailhac's army.

04:09.175 --> 04:10.802
Marcelino, you've only just arrived.

04:10.925 --> 04:14.134
Can I come? I must be 
old enough by now.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.302
See how tall I am. Let's go.

04:16.466 --> 04:19.516
No one is going hunting
or joining any armies.

04:19.675 --> 04:22.599
- What beautiful they are!
- Maria, time for practice.

04:26.717 --> 04:27.889
Maria Justina!

04:28.050 --> 04:30.144
You practice, then we'll go.

04:50.425 --> 04:54.055
NATURAL AND PRIMITIVE HISTORY 
OF MAN EMILE CARTAILHAC

04:54.717 --> 04:57.561
And Father Tomas says I 
should be confirmed this Autumn

04:57.717 --> 04:59.594
or it will be too late.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.886
Too late! Why's that?

05:02.050 --> 05:04.473
Because I ask too many questions.

05:04.633 --> 05:05.759
Do I, Papa?

05:07.008 --> 05:09.557
It's impossible to ask
too many questions

05:09.883 --> 05:12.227
as long as you pay attention
to the answers.

05:24.633 --> 05:27.842
The primitives lived 
over 10,000 years ago.

05:28.342 --> 05:31.095
So by digging down, we look back

05:31.300 --> 05:33.519
a telescope of time.

05:36.842 --> 05:40.392
This must have been a good place.
Sheltered.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.848
Did they sleep on the mud?

05:43.383 --> 05:46.842
And these were skilled craftsmen.

05:47.258 --> 05:48.976
They could make what they needed.

05:51.383 --> 05:53.852
What does it say in Genesis?

05:53.967 --> 05:56.061
"Thou art dust and..."

05:56.258 --> 05:58.431
"And to dust thou shalt return."

05:58.675 --> 06:02.179
Even here, protected 
from the elements,

06:02.675 --> 06:05.975
only the hardest things 
survive the ages:

06:06.508 --> 06:09.136
stone, shells,

06:09.383 --> 06:10.475
bone.

06:12.550 --> 06:14.268
Now listen.

06:16.717 --> 06:18.640
That muddy cave!

06:20.092 --> 06:21.685
Prayers, Missy.

06:24.925 --> 06:27.348
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

06:28.425 --> 06:29.096
Amen.

06:34.383 --> 06:37.842
- Oh, she's asleep.
- No wonder. Exhausted.

06:38.050 --> 06:39.973
I'm not asleep. Show me now!

06:46.592 --> 06:49.846
Maria, look through 
this little window.

06:51.133 --> 06:52.350
Ready?

06:54.925 --> 06:57.098
Papa bought it in Paris.

06:57.758 --> 06:59.601
Moving pictures.

06:59.800 --> 07:00.847
Magical!

07:01.175 --> 07:02.392
But how?

07:02.842 --> 07:04.389
Twelve mirrors.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.186
As the cylinder turns, 
the reflections

07:07.342 --> 07:09.219
give the illusion of motion.

07:09.383 --> 07:10.851
Why are there rainbows?

07:10.967 --> 07:14.517
A prism, where the light
is bent by the glass-

07:18.008 --> 07:20.511
It wants to grow that way.

07:21.217 --> 07:22.844
Well,

07:26.008 --> 07:27.430
if that's what it wants,

07:29.300 --> 07:31.018
we can move the path.

07:32.550 --> 07:33.927
Why not?

07:34.842 --> 07:36.264
C'mon. Come here.

07:38.633 --> 07:41.182
Yeah, right here. 
Throw a line over here.

07:41.842 --> 07:42.684
Over here.

07:44.050 --> 07:46.929
We cannot fight nature, Mero.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.264
To the right, to the right.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.927
What if no one comes?

07:51.092 --> 07:52.435
I hope no one comes.

07:52.592 --> 07:53.935
Ah, don't say that!

07:54.467 --> 07:56.640
I only want to look at you.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.552
The Marquesa did promise...

07:59.008 --> 08:00.055
No, no.

08:00.258 --> 08:01.475
Not this time.

08:01.925 --> 08:04.144
De Los Rios is coming.

08:04.592 --> 08:06.310
You won't argue with him.

08:06.550 --> 08:10.054
The Great Sage of Cantabria, wise
on every subject, informed on none.

08:10.217 --> 08:12.720
Marcelino, please. Stop! Be serious.

08:13.175 --> 08:16.224
Not a word. Unless he says
something very foolish.

08:16.383 --> 08:18.681
Or should I say until? Yes, until.

08:54.133 --> 08:58.013
Gentlemen, it is all ready for you.
Will be just a few more minutes.

08:58.425 --> 09:02.601
Our ancestors lived
more than 10.000 years ago

09:02.800 --> 09:05.053
in what is called the Old Stone Age
or Paleolithic Era.

09:05.467 --> 09:09.267
We don't know the age
of our planet or when mankind...

09:09.425 --> 09:11.974
Nonsense. It has been 
calculated beyond a doubt

09:12.633 --> 09:14.727
that the Earth is
eighteen million years old.

09:14.842 --> 09:15.843
You can read it in my writings.

09:16.050 --> 09:18.052
Calculated, yes,

09:18.425 --> 09:21.679
beyond a doubt, no, 
Señor De Los Rios

09:22.008 --> 09:24.511
There are many who think
it may be a great deal older.

09:24.717 --> 09:25.809
And as to the Origins of Man...

09:25.967 --> 09:28.390
Doesn't the Bible tell us
what to think about Creation,

09:28.550 --> 09:30.473
- Father Tomas?
- Yes, Doña Elena.

09:30.633 --> 09:31.759
God created the World,

09:31.925 --> 09:35.680
but Biblical time cannot 
be reckoned like a calendar.

09:36.258 --> 09:37.601
Thank you, Father Tomas.

09:37.758 --> 09:39.977
- Time for some more music?
- Some music.

09:40.175 --> 09:42.849
Everything we learned as
children is out of date.

09:43.008 --> 09:45.431
New discoveries are being 
made at such a rate

09:45.592 --> 09:46.935
it's wise to keep an open mind.

09:47.092 --> 09:49.094
An open mind is an empty mind.

09:49.258 --> 09:52.467
And, to quote Plato, "an empty
vessel makes the most noise."

09:52.633 --> 09:54.101
Who makes the most noise here?

09:54.467 --> 09:55.844
Excuse me. What you said?

09:56.050 --> 09:59.725
Dear friends,
I hope you will indulge a mother.

09:59.842 --> 10:01.515
My daughter Maria Justina,

10:01.675 --> 10:05.179
will play Iradier's Habanera 
"La Paloma".

10:05.342 --> 10:08.141
I can't bear performing children.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.686
They're worse than 
trained monkeys.

10:18.800 --> 10:22.384
Can I be sorry for my anger
and still be angry?

10:22.550 --> 10:23.767
No, you can't.

10:23.925 --> 10:27.179
- Then I don't want to confess it.
- That's naughty, Maria.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.477
My dear, how are you?

10:31.633 --> 10:32.850
Hello, Elena.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.509
Take no notice of 
Señor De Los Rios.

10:36.675 --> 10:38.552
I'm sure nobody else does.

10:38.717 --> 10:39.843
What do you mean?

10:40.050 --> 10:41.472
It's nothing.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.721
Only he's telling everyone
that his quarrel with Don Marcelino

10:44.842 --> 10:46.719
was the highpoint of the evening.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.969
Monsieur Ratier.

11:01.133 --> 11:02.726
Madame, this is an honor.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.301
Good day.

11:04.467 --> 11:06.765
This is my husband, 
Don Marcelino,

11:06.925 --> 11:08.598
and our daughter, Maria.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.973
It's in a poor state, isn't it?

11:12.133 --> 11:13.931
Well, yes, it is.

11:14.092 --> 11:15.309
You are truly an artist.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.143
The colours are most impressive.

11:19.050 --> 11:20.347
Maria.

11:20.550 --> 11:21.802
You want to look at the carvings?

11:21.967 --> 11:24.015
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good day.

11:24.175 --> 11:25.768
I'll join you later.

11:25.967 --> 11:28.015
It's so beautiful.

11:29.092 --> 11:30.844
You know the trouble with anger?

11:31.758 --> 11:33.931
It's a pistol that backfires.

11:34.092 --> 11:37.426
It hurts you more
than the person you aim at.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.093
Excuse me.

11:41.925 --> 11:43.643
May I look?

11:48.133 --> 11:51.763
- Is it Paleo...
- Paleolithic.

11:52.925 --> 11:54.472
And it's perfect.

11:56.342 --> 11:58.470
Making a cutting edge like this

11:58.633 --> 12:01.842
requires of a very 
sophisticated technique.

12:03.842 --> 12:04.843
Thank you.

12:05.050 --> 12:08.509
Please, where did you find it?

12:16.258 --> 12:17.350
Good morning.

12:17.550 --> 12:19.177
Modesto Cubillas.

12:19.342 --> 12:22.312
You remember, sir?
I showed you the cave before.

12:22.467 --> 12:23.719
Yes, indeed.

12:23.842 --> 12:25.185
You found a way in...

12:25.592 --> 12:27.310
No, it was the dog.

12:28.050 --> 12:30.519
I'm hunting rabbits 
and he gets lost.

12:30.675 --> 12:32.723
Then I search all over and then...

12:32.842 --> 12:33.968
Woof, woof!

12:34.175 --> 12:35.677
I pull back these brambles

12:35.800 --> 12:38.724
and see the rocks have fallen in.
I put my head in and...

12:38.842 --> 12:41.265
"Are you there?"

12:42.300 --> 12:44.428
Up he jumps and 
licks my face, sir.

12:44.633 --> 12:45.930
Let me see this.

12:53.383 --> 12:54.851
Want to take a look?

13:01.800 --> 13:03.768
Pedro, Nero, come here.

13:04.133 --> 13:05.476
Widen the entrance a little more.

13:06.258 --> 13:08.431
I would like to get in tomorrow.

13:10.717 --> 13:11.593
Thank you, gentlemen.

13:11.758 --> 13:12.975
Maria, let's go.

13:13.133 --> 13:14.976
- Bye, Maria.
- Bye.

13:15.633 --> 13:17.385
They were big animals.

13:17.633 --> 13:20.182
The woolly mammoth
was bigger than an elephant,

13:20.342 --> 13:23.266
the aurochs, a cow 
like a cart horse.

13:23.425 --> 13:24.051
Why?

13:24.258 --> 13:27.967
It was very cold, 
the end of the Ice Age.

13:33.967 --> 13:35.219
It's broken.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.432
See how they split the bone
to reach the marrow fat,

13:39.592 --> 13:40.935
the richest part.

13:42.050 --> 13:43.472
Where did you find it?

13:43.800 --> 13:44.847
There.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.019
Moving pictures!

15:26.133 --> 15:27.555
Maria?

15:29.842 --> 15:31.264
Maria!

15:43.550 --> 15:45.473
Oxen, Papa, oxen!

15:46.217 --> 15:47.560
Look, Papa.

15:47.675 --> 15:50.474
- Dancing drawings, papa.
- Let's go back. It's cold in here.

15:50.633 --> 15:53.102
No! See? They move.

15:53.258 --> 15:55.010
Let's see, my dear. What moves?

15:55.758 --> 15:57.055
The stones!

15:57.258 --> 15:59.761
What is it? The stones 
look like oxen?

15:59.925 --> 16:01.802
No, look.

16:19.508 --> 16:21.135
There are many.

16:30.258 --> 16:31.726
It's wet.

16:32.383 --> 16:33.555
Wet.

16:37.633 --> 16:38.976
What is this?

16:39.175 --> 16:41.303
It's a whole herd, Papa.

16:41.467 --> 16:45.677
This one's standing and 
this one isn't finished yet.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.851
- Who painted them, Papa?
- I don't know.

16:51.050 --> 16:52.347
Was it the primitives?

16:53.050 --> 16:54.973
I don't know, Maria.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.519
"Sealed up like a tomb"?

17:25.925 --> 17:27.801
And you let our 
daughter go inside?

17:28.008 --> 17:30.477
It was thousands of 
years ago, a landslide.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.762
There could be another 
landslide at any moment.

17:34.258 --> 17:35.635
How could you...?

17:36.800 --> 17:39.349
Do you forget what 
day it is tomorrow?

17:39.633 --> 17:41.601
Our baby's name day.

17:43.258 --> 17:45.306
Of course I don't forget.

17:47.175 --> 17:49.553
I know how you feel, my love,

17:50.008 --> 17:52.431
but if we took no risks at all,

17:52.592 --> 17:54.720
not even sensible, careful risks,

17:54.842 --> 17:56.810
our lives would be very poor.

17:56.967 --> 17:59.265
Maria made a real discovery today.

17:59.633 --> 18:02.807
The wall paintings
in the church are very old.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.810
But these paintings 
are older, perhaps.

18:04.967 --> 18:05.763
How old?

18:06.133 --> 18:08.101
Ten thousand years. Maybe more.

18:08.717 --> 18:13.143
This is even before the time
of Adam and Eve. How can that be?

18:14.592 --> 18:17.596
You truly believe your cave people
could have been painters?

18:17.717 --> 18:20.061
Whoever did this was a great artist.

18:20.217 --> 18:21.810
As great as any in history.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.219
Miss Maria.

18:23.383 --> 18:25.101
Conchita, it's a miracle.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.552
It's incredible.

18:26.675 --> 18:28.769
If I wouldn't have seen it
with my own eyes...

18:28.925 --> 18:30.677
I have to talk Professor Vilanova.

18:30.967 --> 18:33.937
And then we should get
in contact with Cartailhac.

18:34.092 --> 18:36.561
- This discovery is worthy of his genius.
- Enough!

18:37.758 --> 18:39.806
- Yes, Cartailhac.
- Maria!

18:43.300 --> 18:47.180
My discovery is worthy
of Cartailhac's genius.

18:47.342 --> 18:48.844
What do you say to that?

18:49.342 --> 18:51.140
Never heard of him.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.307
Papa told you about the oxen?

18:57.508 --> 18:59.727
Yes. And that you found them.

18:59.842 --> 19:01.844
You're not cross with me?

19:02.008 --> 19:03.976
Of course not, darling.

19:07.592 --> 19:11.426
And you're not cross with Papa
about Adam and Eve?

19:12.925 --> 19:15.269
Don't worry about such things.

19:15.675 --> 19:17.177
Go to sleep.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.770
Paleolithic, Palaeolithic.

21:22.008 --> 21:25.717
Will you show me your 
"long haired oxen", young lady?

21:26.008 --> 21:29.137
They aren't hairy oxen, Professor,

21:29.300 --> 21:33.726
but bison which inhabited
this region during the Ice Age.

21:33.842 --> 21:35.685
Ahah! A young archaeologist.

21:44.842 --> 21:46.560
Look at this.

21:47.383 --> 21:49.181
And over here.

21:53.717 --> 21:55.310
Look at this.

21:57.008 --> 21:59.181
Look at his head.

22:01.217 --> 22:03.720
It looks as if it were 
painted yesterday.

22:03.925 --> 22:06.553
I wonder if this dark cave
may have preserved them

22:06.675 --> 22:08.348
perfectly down the centuries.

22:08.508 --> 22:11.557
Dating the work is problematic
without geological layers.

22:11.717 --> 22:13.640
The cave was sealed 
and we have found

22:13.800 --> 22:16.098
nothing more recent
than the Upper Paleolithic,

22:16.508 --> 22:18.602
10,000 years by your calculations.

22:18.758 --> 22:22.513
There are carvings and 
engravings from this period

22:22.717 --> 22:26.096
but they're small, portable, much like
the work of primitive peoples today.

22:26.258 --> 22:27.475
Nothing like this.

22:27.592 --> 22:31.347
We found this shell
just there by the wall.

22:33.425 --> 22:35.348
Traces of colour.

22:36.467 --> 22:38.640
Which could be red ochre.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.723
Yes, yes, it's quite possible.

22:47.550 --> 22:50.520
So, Professor Vilanova,
what is your opinion?

22:52.508 --> 22:54.636
I've never seen anything like it:

22:55.175 --> 22:57.348
I don't believe anyone has.

22:57.550 --> 23:01.430
It simply doesn't fit our 
ideas of Prehistoric Man.

23:01.550 --> 23:03.723
Perhaps all our ideas are wrong.

23:10.925 --> 23:12.552
Gentlemen, please!

23:12.758 --> 23:14.852
Respect for our distinguished visitor.

23:16.508 --> 23:20.593
Some of you have yourselves 
seen the evidence of the cave:

23:21.092 --> 23:25.393
a polychrome wall painting
of extinct creatures

23:25.508 --> 23:27.510
in pristine condition.

23:27.633 --> 23:29.635
There is no other example

23:29.800 --> 23:32.724
of such work from the 
Paleolithic Era anywhere.

23:32.842 --> 23:34.765
Because they aren't Paleolithic.

23:36.425 --> 23:37.768
Sir.

23:39.425 --> 23:41.974
This is Paleolithic.

23:46.842 --> 23:51.143
And... this is Paleolithic.

23:53.008 --> 23:54.681
I have an extensive collection

23:55.717 --> 23:58.220
which the Council is 
very welcome to see,

23:58.383 --> 24:01.683
having made prehistory
my study for several years.

24:02.342 --> 24:05.926
I realise this is a profoundly
shocking discovery.

24:06.092 --> 24:08.641
Or an absurd mistake
which will make us Cantabrians

24:08.800 --> 24:11.223
the laughing stock 
throughout the world.

24:11.383 --> 24:15.058
May I ask, sir, how you 
would account for the paintings?

24:17.550 --> 24:18.767
Certainly.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.223
They are the work

24:30.550 --> 24:32.393
of runaway slaves

24:32.717 --> 24:35.641
when this was a Roman province

24:35.800 --> 24:37.973
some two thousand years ago.

24:38.175 --> 24:40.394
No doubt this beasts

24:40.758 --> 24:43.841
were still prevalent
in their barbarian homeland.

24:44.008 --> 24:47.342
There isn't one shred of 
evidence to support that.

24:47.508 --> 24:50.933
There's nothing in the cave
less than ten thousand years old.

24:51.092 --> 24:54.221
Nothing that you've presented,

24:54.383 --> 24:55.851
but how can we be sure?

24:56.050 --> 24:58.098
Do you think I would
distort the evidence?

25:00.133 --> 25:00.759
Sir?

25:00.925 --> 25:03.644
Gentlemen, please!
Allow the Professor to finish.

25:07.592 --> 25:12.598
I know what we are suggesting
appears extraordinary

25:13.383 --> 25:14.851
but these are the facts.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.681
That's monkeys with paintbrushes!

25:20.925 --> 25:23.553
We believe that if the cave

25:24.550 --> 25:26.302
is properly cared for,

25:27.258 --> 25:30.717
the international experts we 
have invited to see the paintings

25:30.842 --> 25:33.140
will share our view

25:33.342 --> 25:35.811
that this discovery,

25:36.300 --> 25:38.177
in our province,

25:38.342 --> 25:42.677
is of enormous significance
in the History of Mankind.

25:57.175 --> 25:59.348
- Isn't that the wife?
- Yes.

26:00.008 --> 26:01.601
A good woman,

26:01.758 --> 26:03.226
devout,

26:03.633 --> 26:06.637
a great supporter of our church.

26:08.633 --> 26:11.307
She must be in need of guidance.

26:19.175 --> 26:20.848
Extraordinary.

26:21.008 --> 26:22.476
Consider this:

26:22.633 --> 26:26.558
a complete novice takes up
the latest Paris fashion

26:26.717 --> 26:30.472
and immediately it makes an 
"extraordinary" discovery on his very doorstep.

26:31.133 --> 26:33.852
Don't you smell a fish?

26:35.050 --> 26:38.259
Professor Vilanova is a true 
friend of the Church.

26:38.633 --> 26:42.718
He exposed the wild assumptions
made by the Darwinists

26:42.842 --> 26:44.765
to support their theory.

26:44.925 --> 26:49.010
I am surprised he should be 
party to such rash speculation.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.722
Exactly.

26:50.842 --> 26:54.597
Only a child could be taken in
by such nonsense.

26:54.758 --> 26:56.351
"Oh, my clever papa!"

26:56.467 --> 26:57.559
Excuse me.

26:57.758 --> 27:00.637
Father Tomas, Monsignor.
I hope you don't think...

27:00.842 --> 27:02.765
Tush, tush.

27:02.967 --> 27:05.595
Glory, glory, my child.

27:07.050 --> 27:08.973
You'll come to me.

27:21.842 --> 27:24.391
Listen to this. Tablanca writes:

27:24.633 --> 27:28.638
"Sautuola seems more 
interested in personal glory

27:28.800 --> 27:31.303
than allowing proper investigation."

27:31.425 --> 27:34.053
Who is this Tablanca?

27:34.425 --> 27:36.519
His column is very popular.

27:37.008 --> 27:39.807
A moral commentary 
on affairs of the day.

27:41.008 --> 27:44.638
An immoral commentary.
Every word is twisted.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.973
No reply from Cartailhac.

27:50.425 --> 27:53.019
Perhaps he disagrees with you.

27:57.508 --> 28:00.057
No one can believe 
it till they see them.

28:05.133 --> 28:06.510
You know?

28:06.675 --> 28:08.143
I was thinking

28:08.842 --> 28:13.177
if I sent some 
well-executed paintings.

28:13.342 --> 28:17.176
My rough sketches give no idea
of the colours, the artistry.

28:18.425 --> 28:21.269
That painter you have working
at the church,

28:22.092 --> 28:23.184
what's his name again?

28:23.342 --> 28:25.060
Paul?

28:25.300 --> 28:26.347
Paul Ratier.

28:26.842 --> 28:28.719
You want me to ask him?

28:32.258 --> 28:33.225
Yes.

28:40.008 --> 28:41.555
Monsieur Ratier.

28:42.008 --> 28:44.636
- Madame, what a pleasure.
- Good day.

28:45.258 --> 28:46.680
How is our mother, Eve?

28:46.842 --> 28:49.186
Very cheerful

28:49.342 --> 28:52.425
for someone about to bring
disaster on all Mankind.

28:52.925 --> 28:54.848
Just wonder if I should 
lessen her smile?

28:56.592 --> 28:59.141
It's her last moment safe
in the Bliss of God.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.803
Don't take that from her.

29:03.217 --> 29:06.426
- I knew you would have the answer.
- Are you allowed to change it?

29:06.592 --> 29:10.096
Maria, I am sure Monsieur Ratier
knows what he is doing.

29:10.258 --> 29:11.475
No, it's a good question.

29:11.633 --> 29:13.806
Sometimes a painting 
is so faded or broken

29:13.967 --> 29:15.640
it's hard to know 
what was intended.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.144
You see here, at the 
corner of her mouth.

29:18.425 --> 29:21.634
Is that a curving lip
or a crack in the plaster?

29:22.133 --> 29:24.010
But you'll be changing History.

29:25.092 --> 29:27.015
Well, improving it a little.

29:28.175 --> 29:30.553
Did you come to see Father Tomas?
I think he's in the sacristy.

29:30.717 --> 29:34.301
No, it's you I wanted to see.

29:37.508 --> 29:38.384
Me?

29:39.467 --> 29:41.390
Isn't he handsome?!

29:41.633 --> 29:43.601
Maria Justina!

29:44.175 --> 29:46.177
It's a plain fact, Mama.

29:46.342 --> 29:49.551
One need not be afraid 
of stating facts.

29:49.717 --> 29:53.392
A lady should avoid stating
facts whenever possible.

29:53.508 --> 29:55.385
It's most unbecoming.

29:55.550 --> 29:59.680
Did you know that earthworms
can dig up to six feet underground?

29:59.842 --> 30:01.219
Really?

30:01.383 --> 30:03.636
That's what Mr. Darwin says.

30:04.175 --> 30:05.427
Did your father tell you that?

30:05.592 --> 30:07.640
Only about the earthworms.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.848
He never tells me 
anything about evolution

30:10.008 --> 30:12.386
and those things you fight about.

30:13.508 --> 30:15.010
Wait here.

30:19.425 --> 30:22.224
The Bible speaks clearly
about Adam and Eve.

30:22.383 --> 30:23.430
Correct.

30:23.592 --> 30:26.015
And who gave you 
your power of reason?

30:26.842 --> 30:27.934
God.

30:28.133 --> 30:30.352
So how could they be in conflict?

30:30.467 --> 30:34.517
If Faith and Reason seem at 
odds, isn't terribly important.

30:34.675 --> 30:36.769
Our Holy Father instructs us

30:36.925 --> 30:41.806
that False Opinion has taken
the place of True Reason.

30:42.467 --> 30:46.142
I think of Galileo and his 
punishment by the Church,

30:46.300 --> 30:48.018
which now we know 
to have been wrong.

30:48.175 --> 30:49.301
Quite so,

30:49.425 --> 30:53.805
Galileo revealed the true workings
of the Divine Universe,

30:54.217 --> 30:57.346
but for the Darwinists
here is no Divine Being,

30:57.842 --> 31:01.016
no plan for Humanity or Creation,

31:01.175 --> 31:04.429
only the random workings of Nature,

31:04.633 --> 31:07.102
poorly described by science.

31:07.508 --> 31:09.852
As we understand more,

31:10.008 --> 31:12.136
might not they too be proved right?

31:12.300 --> 31:15.383
This is not about the 
orbit of Earth and Sun,

31:15.550 --> 31:21.011
this is Man setting his puny intellect
against the majesty of God.

31:21.217 --> 31:22.594
Rationalism...

31:23.008 --> 31:27.138
seeks to destroy the deepest
foundations of human society:

31:27.300 --> 31:29.769
Love, Honour, Family.

31:29.925 --> 31:33.054
What use for them
in a purely rational world?

31:34.842 --> 31:37.186
I do worry that Maria...

31:37.342 --> 31:40.516
My husband... He takes
such a part in her education...

31:40.925 --> 31:42.552
My dear child,

31:43.217 --> 31:45.515
I share your concerns.

31:49.050 --> 31:50.597
Deeply.

32:06.508 --> 32:07.976
Who made the world?

32:08.175 --> 32:09.597
God made the world.

32:09.758 --> 32:10.429
Who is God?

32:10.592 --> 32:13.596
God is the Creator of 
Heaven and Earth

32:13.758 --> 32:15.351
and of all things.

32:15.508 --> 32:16.930
What is Man?

32:17.092 --> 32:20.596
Man is a creature composed
of body and soul,

32:20.758 --> 32:23.011
made in the image of God.

32:24.092 --> 32:26.686
Why did God make you, Maria?

32:26.842 --> 32:29.641
God made me to know 
Him, to love Him

32:30.050 --> 32:32.348
and to serve Him in this world.

32:33.550 --> 32:35.598
And does God want 
you to serve Him

32:36.258 --> 32:38.135
with half of your wits?

32:38.550 --> 32:40.097
With one hand in the air?

32:40.342 --> 32:41.514
No, Father.

32:41.675 --> 32:44.394
No, He does not.

32:44.592 --> 32:47.186
I was admiring his 
Creation, Father.

32:47.300 --> 32:50.349
Did you know the very same 
bones we have in our hands

32:50.508 --> 32:53.102
are in dolphins' flippers 
and bats' wings?

32:53.258 --> 32:54.851
Isn't that marvellous?

33:04.092 --> 33:06.845
- Who made the world?
- God made the world.

33:07.050 --> 33:08.097
Who is God?

33:31.800 --> 33:33.302
That's not good.

33:34.133 --> 33:35.430
Your wife?

33:35.633 --> 33:36.805
She sounds good to me.

33:36.967 --> 33:38.514
Scarlatti.

33:38.925 --> 33:40.598
Only in times of strife.

33:41.092 --> 33:42.469
Wagner is the worst though.

33:43.217 --> 33:44.719
Then it's better not to be here!

33:45.217 --> 33:46.469
Thank you for the warning.

33:47.467 --> 33:48.969
A bowl?

33:49.175 --> 33:50.722
A discus?

33:53.967 --> 33:56.311
We are groping in the dark.

34:29.382 --> 34:31.601
Paleolithic. Paleolithic.

35:06.842 --> 35:09.140
Professor Vilanova, 
Monsieur Paul Ratier.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.847
- How do you do, sir?
- A great artist.

35:11.217 --> 35:13.219
Perhaps you can persuade my wife

35:13.342 --> 35:15.140
to come and see the real thing.

35:15.592 --> 35:17.139
I don't think so, no.

35:17.925 --> 35:18.972
Please, come in.

35:20.342 --> 35:23.642
Like this they seem random
but each one is placed carefully

35:23.800 --> 35:26.269
in exact relation to 
the rock formation.

35:28.008 --> 35:30.511
What of the quality? As an artist,

35:30.925 --> 35:32.427
what's your opinion?

35:33.758 --> 35:35.260
To be honest,

35:36.175 --> 35:38.223
I find them astonishing.

35:38.550 --> 35:41.679
There is an understanding 
of movement, an energy,

35:41.842 --> 35:44.971
a direct observation of Nature
that seems wholly modern.

35:45.717 --> 35:49.517
I have to rethink everything
I had assumed about art.

35:49.675 --> 35:51.427
This is quite a shock.

35:51.592 --> 35:53.811
Hardly the work of monkeys then?

35:53.967 --> 35:55.264
Certainly not.

35:55.383 --> 35:57.351
Do you see, dear lady, 
what this means?

35:57.633 --> 35:59.385
Ten thousand years ago

35:59.550 --> 36:02.144
Mankind was as we are now,

36:02.258 --> 36:05.137
created with a soul in God's image.

36:05.258 --> 36:08.182
We have not evolved into Humanity,

36:08.425 --> 36:10.348
we have always been so.

36:10.508 --> 36:14.342
Do you think that the paintings
might be in accord with our faith?

36:14.508 --> 36:16.181
Faith and True Reason.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.677
Conchita, my dear.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.640
If we are correct,

36:21.258 --> 36:23.636
then, the Primitive Man,

36:24.342 --> 36:29.644
at this time had the ability
to describe what he saw in paint.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.427
That's all we know.

36:31.633 --> 36:35.263
We shouldn't try to fit 
the facts to a set of beliefs.

36:37.175 --> 36:40.224
We have to wait for Cartailhac.

36:40.342 --> 36:42.811
If the mountain will not 
come to Mahomet...

36:43.467 --> 36:44.969
With your permission

36:45.300 --> 36:48.099
I would like to present 
our findings

36:48.258 --> 36:51.592
at the International Conference
of Prehistory in Lisbon

36:51.758 --> 36:53.305
next month.

36:53.508 --> 36:55.931
It will be easy for the delegates
to come here afterwards.

36:56.092 --> 36:58.094
- You'll do that? Really?
- Of course.

37:00.592 --> 37:03.675
- Thank you, my friend.
- And you should come.

37:04.383 --> 37:05.726
Thank you.

37:07.383 --> 37:08.930
Conchita,

37:14.092 --> 37:15.969
you think...

37:16.758 --> 37:20.592
you think religion and science

37:20.758 --> 37:22.852
can't coexist, right?

37:23.050 --> 37:24.267
Right?

37:25.342 --> 37:26.594
My love,

37:28.550 --> 37:29.972
imagine...

37:30.508 --> 37:33.842
imagine that I am science

37:36.008 --> 37:37.931
and you

37:38.092 --> 37:39.469
are religion.

37:40.675 --> 37:41.767
Yes.

37:53.342 --> 37:55.219
I don't know if that's science,

37:55.383 --> 37:58.262
but it is definitely not religion.

38:02.633 --> 38:05.432
Water is denser than air,

38:05.592 --> 38:08.596
so as the light passes
 through each drop,

38:09.050 --> 38:11.394
it bends, the colours split

38:12.217 --> 38:14.094
and we see a rainbow.

38:14.800 --> 38:18.850
So Noah's rainbow was only 
reflections, not a promise?

38:19.425 --> 38:22.508
If we explore the 
mystery of Creation,

38:23.133 --> 38:25.261
discovering how it works,

38:25.967 --> 38:27.844
does that destroy its wonder?

38:28.008 --> 38:31.842
You know that a piece of music
is made of notes, chords,

38:32.008 --> 38:35.474
crotchets and rests, but that
doesn't stop it sounding lovely

38:35.675 --> 38:38.428
or inspiring beautiful thoughts.

38:38.592 --> 38:41.015
It does when I have to learn it.

38:41.633 --> 38:44.307
- My dear.
- This came by special messenger.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.222
From Cartailhac?

38:48.092 --> 38:50.470
Open it, Papa, open it.

38:50.633 --> 38:51.555
Please.

38:58.675 --> 39:00.518
It seems that...

39:01.050 --> 39:02.677
His Majesty,

39:03.258 --> 39:04.851
holidaying in the region,

39:05.050 --> 39:06.518
would like to see the paintings.

39:06.675 --> 39:10.054
- The King! Oh, Papa!
- Precisely.

39:10.175 --> 39:12.223
The King! Alfonso XII.

39:22.342 --> 39:24.140
This are our workers.

39:24.550 --> 39:26.177
Very good work.

39:26.300 --> 39:27.472
Congratulations.

39:27.675 --> 39:31.600
Beg pardon, but this is the
dog that found the cave.

39:31.758 --> 39:33.180
And I am the dog's owner.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.552
So by rights I should get...

39:34.717 --> 39:37.266
Please, there is nothing 
to worry about.

39:37.425 --> 39:38.927
It is only a sheep dog.

39:39.133 --> 39:40.851
A now royal sheep dog.

39:41.342 --> 39:42.343
A dog!

39:42.508 --> 39:45.682
Yes, it was sheer 
fluke this discovery.

39:45.842 --> 39:49.301
De Los Rios, your 
most humble servant.

39:50.133 --> 39:51.430
As you may know, Your Majesty,

39:51.633 --> 39:55.137
I myself have made many
important finds in the region.

39:55.258 --> 39:56.305
Marquesa!

39:57.925 --> 40:00.678
Sir, this is my wife, Conchita.

40:01.133 --> 40:02.601
- Señora Sautuola.
- Your Majesty.

40:02.758 --> 40:05.261
Your husband has given Spain
something to be proud of.

40:05.842 --> 40:08.311
The whole world must know of this.

40:08.467 --> 40:09.684
Thank you, sir.

40:09.842 --> 40:11.936
And you must be 
the little bull-finder.

40:12.092 --> 40:13.059
Bravo!

40:14.342 --> 40:16.185
A photograph, please.

40:16.675 --> 40:17.847
Come along.

40:20.633 --> 40:21.600
Don Marcelino,

40:21.758 --> 40:24.728
congratulations once again
in your important discovery.

40:24.842 --> 40:26.560
Long live to the King!

40:39.300 --> 40:41.302
I was just thinking,

40:41.467 --> 40:43.811
before it was our secret.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.432
When you go to Lisbon
and tell Monsieur Cartailhac

40:47.592 --> 40:49.265
everyone will know.

40:49.842 --> 40:54.143
But it's good to share 
knowledge, isn't it?

40:54.508 --> 40:55.851
Yes.

40:58.550 --> 41:00.268
Listen, Maria,

41:00.467 --> 41:03.437
When I first visited the cave,

41:03.633 --> 41:05.635
I saw nothing.

41:05.800 --> 41:09.850
When I went back, 
we discovered the bison.

41:10.050 --> 41:13.099
Now, what was the difference?

41:14.800 --> 41:17.428
You went to Paris and learned
from Monsieur Cartailhac.

41:18.383 --> 41:19.430
No.

41:20.592 --> 41:24.847
The difference was that
you were there.

41:26.133 --> 41:29.342
You looked without prejudice.

41:31.050 --> 41:34.259
It will always be 
your discovery, Maria.

41:41.550 --> 41:42.642
Shall we?

41:44.258 --> 41:45.430
My lady.

42:20.508 --> 42:22.931
Monsieur Ratier.

42:39.008 --> 42:40.385
Monsignor.

42:41.092 --> 42:42.469
Isn't it good?

42:42.633 --> 42:43.429
Very good.

42:43.633 --> 42:46.386
We made a wise choice 
in Monsieur Ratier.

42:47.217 --> 42:49.845
I'm sorry you missed
the King's visit.

42:50.050 --> 42:52.644
More excitement than any 
of us can remember.

42:53.383 --> 42:55.681
You enjoyed yourself, I'm glad.

42:55.842 --> 42:58.391
But beware vain, glory,

42:58.550 --> 43:01.599
pride, intellectual pride or...

43:02.050 --> 43:04.678
a desire for worldly honour

43:04.842 --> 43:06.719
is a trap

43:06.842 --> 43:08.594
for the most pious.

43:08.925 --> 43:11.804
Remember the 
Scribes and Pharisees.

43:30.758 --> 43:33.136
Is this good enough 
for Lisbon next week?

43:33.633 --> 43:35.931
Do you still need to go?

43:36.092 --> 43:37.594
Now the King has been.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.849
It's the largest ever
conference of prehistory.

43:41.842 --> 43:45.722
Professor Vilanova does me
great honour to invite me.

43:45.842 --> 43:47.719
And they'll come on here?

43:48.633 --> 43:51.102
To begin the proper work
of examination, yes.

43:52.425 --> 43:54.143
They are atheists.

43:54.342 --> 43:56.811
It's a scientific meeting.

43:57.175 --> 43:59.803
We don't discuss such questions.

44:00.342 --> 44:03.391
What more can you need to know?

44:05.175 --> 44:07.052
Everything.

44:07.675 --> 44:09.052
Everything.

44:10.133 --> 44:12.181
How were they achieved?

44:13.008 --> 44:14.635
Were paintings common,

44:14.800 --> 44:17.849
but all lost or 
undiscovered until now?

44:19.050 --> 44:21.553
Or is this the work 
of a lone genius,

44:21.717 --> 44:25.267
the Leonardo of the Paleolithic?

44:26.133 --> 44:28.511
The paintings are of bison,

44:28.717 --> 44:33.143
yet we haven't found one 
single bison bone fragment

44:33.300 --> 44:34.677
in the cave.

44:34.842 --> 44:36.640
What was their purpose?

44:37.967 --> 44:40.561
Are we looking at a history?

44:41.092 --> 44:42.765
Celebration?

44:42.925 --> 44:44.393
Religion?

44:44.967 --> 44:47.641
Do you agree with 
Professor Vilanova?

44:47.800 --> 44:50.679
You want to find the souls
of your cavemen.

44:50.842 --> 44:53.095
I want to understand 
the evidence.

44:55.675 --> 44:57.518
You should come to church.

45:21.092 --> 45:22.594
F sharp!

45:22.758 --> 45:23.975
F sharp.

45:25.217 --> 45:26.594
Pay attention.

45:32.383 --> 45:33.726
Mama.

45:35.092 --> 45:38.551
Monsieur Paul said I 
could go drawing with him.

45:38.967 --> 45:40.139
May I?

45:40.300 --> 45:43.429
Drawing? Yes, I suppose so.

45:43.592 --> 45:46.391
But I don't want you in that 
cave anymore. Don't be long.

45:46.550 --> 45:48.143
Yes, mama.

45:55.675 --> 45:58.019
Do you know how to do that?

45:59.758 --> 46:01.260
What are you doing?

46:01.842 --> 46:04.061
We need colours to paint.

46:06.008 --> 46:09.387
Did you know the world
used to be frozen all over,

46:09.550 --> 46:11.143
even the seas?

46:11.842 --> 46:14.436
So I could have walked
from here to America?

46:14.800 --> 46:16.143
Skated.

46:16.300 --> 46:17.847
Do you want to go to America?

46:18.050 --> 46:19.302
Doesn't everyone?

46:19.467 --> 46:21.310
Mama and Papa don't.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.518
They have everything 
they want here.

46:23.675 --> 46:24.801
Don't you?

46:27.092 --> 46:29.936
I'm really glad to have an 
expect guide like you, but...

46:30.217 --> 46:32.595
I hope I'm not taking you
from your lessons.

46:32.800 --> 46:35.974
Papa thinks the best 
way to learn is by doing.

46:36.592 --> 46:37.764
He's right.

46:38.592 --> 46:40.640
He's a very wise man, 
you know?

46:40.800 --> 46:42.848
Was your father a painter?

46:43.550 --> 46:44.472
And his father too.

46:45.133 --> 46:49.092
Perhaps your great great great
great great great grandfather

46:49.300 --> 46:50.973
was a cave painter?

46:53.633 --> 46:55.806
I never thought about that.

46:55.967 --> 46:57.469
I like the idea.

46:58.258 --> 46:59.475
Let's make a cave painting.

47:03.633 --> 47:06.386
The cave master must 
have planned it very well.

47:11.758 --> 47:13.055
I can't.

47:13.258 --> 47:14.726
Of course you can.

47:15.467 --> 47:18.141
Painting is looking. That is all.

47:20.925 --> 47:23.769
You know? You'll always be the girl

47:23.925 --> 47:26.474
who discovered the oldest 
paintings in the world.

47:26.633 --> 47:29.682
Not many people do anything in their
whole life that comes close to that.

47:31.425 --> 47:33.553
Let alone at nine years old.

47:34.258 --> 47:36.260
Is it true? Tell me.

47:36.425 --> 47:37.426
Yes.

47:37.842 --> 47:38.968
Try it.

47:43.217 --> 47:44.764
This is too much.

47:44.925 --> 47:46.427
I'll give you some.

47:47.175 --> 47:48.768
It's late.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.518
I must go home.

47:57.258 --> 47:58.510
Hide your hands.

48:01.258 --> 48:02.760
Good evening, sir.

48:10.175 --> 48:11.552
What a face!

48:11.758 --> 48:12.975
I would like to paint him.

48:13.092 --> 48:16.221
He's a horrid old cave bear!

48:25.133 --> 48:27.010
- Oh, no!
- What?

48:27.383 --> 48:28.930
Wagner.

48:36.550 --> 48:37.676
Thank you.

48:39.758 --> 48:41.305
Maria! Maria!

48:44.592 --> 48:46.094
Bravo!

48:46.258 --> 48:47.805
Au revoir.

49:29.758 --> 49:31.305
That's what I have been told.

49:32.175 --> 49:34.553
That your husband does 
not believe in the Bible.

49:35.717 --> 49:38.971
That he's using the paintings
to harm the Church.

49:39.133 --> 49:40.350
He would never...

49:40.508 --> 49:42.681
He doesn't think like that, Elena.

49:43.342 --> 49:44.810
I'm just telling you

49:44.967 --> 49:46.935
so it doesn't catch you unaware.

49:47.050 --> 49:48.222
Father Tomas.

49:48.383 --> 49:50.431
I am glad you are here, my child.

49:50.633 --> 49:51.976
I am always here, Father.

49:52.092 --> 49:54.094
You have been working
for him in that cave.

49:54.675 --> 49:56.018
Don't deny it.

49:56.258 --> 50:00.343
The Monsignor has a special
message from the Bishop,

50:00.508 --> 50:02.761
in the light of all the recent...

50:02.967 --> 50:04.560
disturbance.

50:05.342 --> 50:06.844
Your husband is coming?

50:07.008 --> 50:10.091
He's preparing his findings
to present to the world's experts.

50:12.633 --> 50:14.977
For the greater glory of God.

50:16.175 --> 50:19.429
Beware those who 
fall into the Abyss

50:20.508 --> 50:23.352
of materialism and atheism.

50:23.508 --> 50:26.717
They labour to destroy
the deepest foundations

50:27.425 --> 50:29.519
of human society.

50:30.050 --> 50:33.805
They call the Divine 
Scripture "mythology".

50:34.092 --> 50:36.561
They deny the Virgin Birth.

50:36.717 --> 50:38.560
They attack the Holy Family.

50:38.717 --> 50:40.264
Think then of the peril

50:40.425 --> 50:43.975
should your children be 
exposed to their heresy.

50:44.925 --> 50:48.600
These are grave and bitter evils.

50:48.842 --> 50:52.051
Anyone who does not confess

50:52.217 --> 50:54.936
that the world and 
all things in it

50:55.050 --> 50:58.304
are created for the glory of God,

51:02.175 --> 51:04.269
let him be anathema,

51:05.508 --> 51:07.510
cast out from the Church.

51:25.675 --> 51:27.473
I'm going to the cave.

51:47.550 --> 51:50.599
The primitives didn't 
have an easy life.

51:50.925 --> 51:53.599
No one has an easy life, Maria.

52:02.925 --> 52:04.142
Visitors.

52:06.050 --> 52:07.973
We weren't expecting you.

52:08.175 --> 52:09.722
Edouard Harlé,

52:10.425 --> 52:11.768
at your service.

52:12.925 --> 52:13.926
Sautuola.

52:14.092 --> 52:16.641
You have come on behalf 
of Monsieur Cartailhac?

52:16.800 --> 52:17.847
Oh, yes.

52:17.967 --> 52:20.641
You are very welcome. 
Very welcome indeed.

52:20.800 --> 52:22.928
You are on the way to 
Lisbon, to the conference.

52:23.092 --> 52:24.514
That's the one.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.517
Ratier.

52:29.467 --> 52:31.845
Please, won't you come in?

52:32.008 --> 52:34.511
It will give me great pleasure
to show you the cave.

52:34.675 --> 52:38.179
I would prefer to see for myself,

52:38.383 --> 52:39.680
if you permit.

52:42.342 --> 52:43.844
As you wish, yes.

52:44.550 --> 52:45.847
Yes, please.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.143
You're gonna need this.

52:50.967 --> 52:52.435
Of course.

53:05.842 --> 53:07.844
Look at the depth of colour,

53:08.050 --> 53:09.802
the definition.

53:09.925 --> 53:12.849
There is no sign of weathering.

53:20.383 --> 53:23.353
The paint is actually fresh!

53:29.008 --> 53:30.134
Half an hour.

53:30.467 --> 53:31.969
What are they doing there?

53:33.883 --> 53:36.181
That's good, a deer.

53:36.342 --> 53:39.972
Whoever did paint this
he has quite a talent.

53:40.425 --> 53:43.304
- Ratier.
- But those tiny legs...

53:44.258 --> 53:47.387
He has the proportion all wrong.

53:48.092 --> 53:50.561
It is all too evident he has 
never seen an aurochs.

53:50.717 --> 53:52.640
It's not an aurochs. It's a bison!

53:52.800 --> 53:54.973
- Damn child again.
- Who is she?

53:55.133 --> 53:56.555
What are you doing in here?

53:56.717 --> 53:59.015
You are spying. Out! Go on!

54:00.758 --> 54:01.759
Get out!

54:02.092 --> 54:03.639
What are you doing here?

54:04.842 --> 54:06.515
- This is my cave.
- Get out!

54:06.675 --> 54:07.972
Go on!

54:08.467 --> 54:10.515
Typical crackpot nonsense,

54:10.675 --> 54:13.144
allowing a childplay in here.

54:13.300 --> 54:15.177
This child made the discovery.

54:15.342 --> 54:16.935
Whereas you, sir,

54:17.092 --> 54:18.685
no one invited you here.

54:18.842 --> 54:21.186
So take your malicious 
opinion and get out.

54:21.425 --> 54:22.677
Out!

54:30.842 --> 54:34.221
He's a liar. And the other one
is an idiot who knows nothing!

54:34.383 --> 54:35.179
Enough.

54:35.342 --> 54:37.219
This is a very important visit

54:37.383 --> 54:39.306
and it must be conducted
in a scientific manner.

54:39.467 --> 54:40.559
Sir, please.

54:40.717 --> 54:41.684
But they don't understand-

54:41.842 --> 54:43.310
Ratier, please take her outside.

54:43.467 --> 54:44.434
- Please, come.
- They don't.

54:44.592 --> 54:45.764
Come with me. Come.

54:46.925 --> 54:48.051
Shut up!

54:48.717 --> 54:50.594
The rest of the cave. Sir, please.

55:14.342 --> 55:15.810
Were have you been?

55:18.550 --> 55:20.644
Maria, darling, are you alright?

55:56.008 --> 55:57.385
Papa!

56:55.508 --> 56:57.385
The air in that cave is bad.

56:57.550 --> 57:00.303
- It's an evil place.
- There are other cases in town.

57:00.467 --> 57:04.017
- They haven't been in the cave.
- Everyone's been in that hateful cave.

57:04.633 --> 57:06.135
See what you've done,

57:06.300 --> 57:08.223
digging up things 
best left alone!

57:08.383 --> 57:09.635
Best left alone. Why?

57:09.800 --> 57:12.269
So that we can continue
in ignorance and error?

57:12.425 --> 57:14.143
You have no respect
for the way things are.

57:14.342 --> 57:16.936
No. If they're wrong, no.

57:17.383 --> 57:19.477
You're so arrogant.

57:19.675 --> 57:21.552
You think anyone who 
disagrees with you is a fool.

57:21.758 --> 57:24.477
- No. But this blinkered dogmatic view...
- Dogmatic?

57:25.092 --> 57:27.595
You've lost your Faith
and you want to take mine.

57:27.758 --> 57:29.700
It has nothing to do 
with Faith, only logic.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.801
If your Faith gives you comfort...

57:31.008 --> 57:33.102
Don't treat me like a child.

57:33.258 --> 57:34.700
Do you think it's
easy to believe?

57:34.800 --> 57:36.894
To believe in a loving

57:37.050 --> 57:38.802
all-powerful deity

57:38.967 --> 57:42.392
who want only destroys his 
Creation. No, I don't think it's easy.

57:42.592 --> 57:44.811
You hate God for taking our babies.

57:44.925 --> 57:47.474
I didn't say that, 
don't twist my words.

57:47.675 --> 57:49.803
You should not have 
care of a child.

57:49.967 --> 57:52.436
It's not me that fills her head
with Sin and Hell.

57:52.592 --> 57:53.593
I won't listen to this.

57:53.758 --> 57:55.886
Because you have no arguments
on your side, my dear.

57:56.092 --> 57:58.811
Please stop. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

57:59.008 --> 58:00.931
It's alright, It's alright.

58:01.342 --> 58:04.141
Go. Go back to your cave.

58:51.592 --> 58:52.889
Professor.

58:53.050 --> 58:54.393
Marcelino.

58:56.592 --> 58:58.936
It isn't better to reveal them
in your lecture?

58:59.092 --> 59:01.700
I am told there is some resistance.

59:01.800 --> 59:05.805
The very idea of paintings 
of this age is difficult to grasp.

59:06.633 --> 59:08.761
It's going to be a sensation.

59:09.467 --> 59:11.185
Esteemed colleagues.

59:14.008 --> 59:16.602
So many distinguished experts.

59:18.675 --> 59:21.929
Perhaps we in Spain 
can't claim the...

59:22.092 --> 59:24.140
eminence of France

59:24.300 --> 59:28.225
but the good Lord has seen fit to 
bless us with a miraculous discovery.

59:30.425 --> 59:33.269
From this day we 
must begin again,

59:33.425 --> 59:37.225
to construct a new 
history of Mankind.

59:39.800 --> 59:43.759
This discovery is a profound
challenge to my own beliefs.

59:47.800 --> 59:50.974
But it is not for me
to tell you about our findings.

59:51.967 --> 59:53.514
You don't know him yet,

59:53.717 --> 59:57.642
but I am sure he will soon be 
a famous name around the world

59:57.758 --> 01:00:01.388
Gentlemen, 
Don Marcelino Sautuola.

01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:02.767
Marcelino, come!

01:00:13.508 --> 01:00:16.307
Thank you, Professor Vilanova.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.517
I...

01:00:24.508 --> 01:00:26.010
Gentlemen,

01:00:27.383 --> 01:00:30.717
this is a very great 
honour, indeed.

01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:35.928
I'm only a foot soldier

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.392
but here I am,

01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:40.348
addressing the generals!

01:01:01.592 --> 01:01:04.436
It seems quite 
plausible to suggest

01:01:05.217 --> 01:01:07.811
that these remarkable paintings,

01:01:08.008 --> 01:01:10.887
which mainly represent
animals not seen in the region

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:12.552
since the last Ice Age,

01:01:12.925 --> 01:01:14.973
these masterpieces

01:01:16.133 --> 01:01:18.727
date from the same period.

01:01:22.467 --> 01:01:23.719
Thank you.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.759
I take my hat off to you,
Professor Vilanova.

01:01:33.008 --> 01:01:34.681
You have astonished us.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.055
I do not blame Monsieur 
Sautuola, a mere amateur,

01:01:39.217 --> 01:01:43.973
for his failure to understand
the basic principles of our science.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.302
We do not expect miracles,

01:01:46.467 --> 01:01:48.720
those went out 
with the Enlightenment.

01:01:49.967 --> 01:01:54.052
We have now a very complete 
record of Prehistoric Man.

01:01:54.217 --> 01:01:56.015
I must inform you, sir,

01:01:56.425 --> 01:01:59.884
that this record does not include
any evidence of wall painting,

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:01.802
not even a stick man.

01:02:02.008 --> 01:02:05.137
That's why we urge 
you to visit the cave.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.768
We were as amazed as you.

01:02:06.925 --> 01:02:08.643
It is quite impossible 
that primitive man,

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:10.010
with his rudimentary brain,

01:02:10.217 --> 01:02:12.891
could create such 
elaborate works.

01:02:14.092 --> 01:02:15.810
Do you deny evolution, sir?

01:02:16.925 --> 01:02:18.552
Indeed not.

01:02:18.717 --> 01:02:19.718
But if there is evidence...

01:02:19.883 --> 01:02:23.558
Show me this evidence that sweeps
aside the whole of prehistory

01:02:23.717 --> 01:02:25.890
as we, poor fools, understand it.

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:27.893
That's what we're trying to do.

01:02:28.258 --> 01:02:30.977
It's all there, in the cave.

01:02:31.717 --> 01:02:33.310
But... Hold on.

01:02:35.967 --> 01:02:36.968
This.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.473
You will see the same animal

01:02:39.633 --> 01:02:41.510
in the same style

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:44.056
on a small stone

01:02:44.717 --> 01:02:45.764
found on the site.

01:02:45.925 --> 01:02:47.723
We are not discussing 
portable works

01:02:47.883 --> 01:02:52.639
but a vast fresco painted by
a Paleolithic Michelangelo

01:02:52.925 --> 01:02:55.053
or perhaps a tribe 
of Michelangelos.

01:02:55.217 --> 01:02:58.801
You don't want to admit evidence
that challenges your beautiful theory,

01:02:58.967 --> 01:03:00.969
but that is not good science, sir.

01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:03.428
This is a very serious matter.

01:03:03.925 --> 01:03:05.802
Monsieur Harlé has 
examined the paintings

01:03:06.008 --> 01:03:08.602
and they are nothing more
than crude forgeries.

01:03:09.258 --> 01:03:10.931
- What?
- C'est un scandal!

01:03:11.383 --> 01:03:12.805
Monsieur Harlé reports

01:03:13.008 --> 01:03:16.717
that the paintings could not have 
been made without artificial light

01:03:16.883 --> 01:03:20.262
and yet there are no 
soot marks on the ceiling

01:03:20.425 --> 01:03:23.429
as would be inevitable
with primitive torches.

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:28.017
Furthermore, in ancient rock paintings,
the pigment sinks into the stone,

01:03:28.175 --> 01:03:31.975
but here it's on the 
surface and quite fresh.

01:03:32.133 --> 01:03:35.683
In places the pigment has even been
laid on top of a layer of calcite.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.474
But in other places
it is beneath the calcite...

01:03:38.633 --> 01:03:39.304
Evidence!

01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:41.811
Here is the evidence. 
Found at the site.

01:03:42.467 --> 01:03:43.764
Fresh paint!

01:03:43.967 --> 01:03:44.809
What is this?

01:03:46.508 --> 01:03:49.136
Please, this is not the case.

01:03:50.342 --> 01:03:54.222
I agree the freshness
of the paintings is surprising

01:03:54.425 --> 01:03:56.143
but when you consider
that the cave was closed

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.927
for thousands of 
years, possibly...

01:03:58.092 --> 01:04:01.016
A painter was seen painting
in the Altamira cave.

01:04:01.175 --> 01:04:02.597
Do you deny it? 
Do you deny it?

01:04:02.758 --> 01:04:05.352
I don't know what 
you are saying, sir.

01:04:06.383 --> 01:04:07.976
Sir, you can't 
close your eyes.

01:04:08.133 --> 01:04:09.976
It's against science, 
against truth,

01:04:10.133 --> 01:04:11.680
Monsieur Cartailhac,

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.098
this could be the greatest
discovery of our age!

01:04:14.258 --> 01:04:16.511
Won't you even look, sir?

01:04:17.342 --> 01:04:19.060
I know what I would find, sir.

01:04:19.217 --> 01:04:20.685
You are a forger.

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:23.927
You should be ashamed.

01:06:14.258 --> 01:06:15.805
Papa?

01:06:26.925 --> 01:06:30.099
I deeply regret any 
trouble I caused, sir.

01:06:30.592 --> 01:06:32.219
Your concern comes too late.

01:06:32.383 --> 01:06:33.475
The damage is done.

01:06:33.633 --> 01:06:36.557
You left a trail like a 
murderer's bloody footprints!

01:06:36.675 --> 01:06:38.973
They were technical studies.
I never thought they would twist it.

01:06:39.133 --> 01:06:42.933
It's as if you worked for them, you
made it so easy to prove their case.

01:06:43.425 --> 01:06:46.429
Every other objection
we could have answered...

01:06:47.133 --> 01:06:48.635
Except the light.

01:06:49.175 --> 01:06:50.518
The light.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:56.184
I don't understand why 
there are no soot marks.

01:06:59.967 --> 01:07:02.891
I was trying to follow your own 
method and experiment, that's all.

01:07:03.883 --> 01:07:05.430
I can only say I'm sorry.
What else can I do?

01:07:05.592 --> 01:07:06.593
Nothing, nothing.

01:07:07.133 --> 01:07:09.386
You've already done 
more than enough.

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:11.644
What are you doing? No.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.973
Please!

01:07:17.008 --> 01:07:19.056
Stop it, stop it!

01:07:20.008 --> 01:07:21.351
He only did as you asked.

01:07:21.508 --> 01:07:23.727
Don't shoot your anger at him.
I made us paint there,

01:07:23.883 --> 01:07:25.476
I upset that horrid cave bear.

01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:28.512
I found the bison. 
It's all my fault.

01:07:29.258 --> 01:07:32.387
You hate him because 
he loves Mama.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.347
Maria!

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:43.560
Go to your room.

01:07:46.133 --> 01:07:47.806
Go to your room, now!

01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:50.519
I hate it, I hate your cave.

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:53.227
I wish I'd never seen it.

01:07:58.467 --> 01:08:01.186
I hate you, I hate you, 
I hate you.

01:08:04.925 --> 01:08:06.222
Maria!

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:09.718
Maria!

01:10:29.675 --> 01:10:31.552
I am so sorry.

01:10:31.925 --> 01:10:34.929
Madame, I have met forgers

01:10:35.342 --> 01:10:39.802
and those who commission forgeries
in my line of work, it's inevitable.

01:10:40.008 --> 01:10:40.930
I know you wouldn't...

01:10:41.092 --> 01:10:44.596
Yes, but a forgery is always
an expected piece,

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.644
one of a series or 
like existing works.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.802
So that the market will want it.

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:53.974
But no one would ever fake

01:10:54.175 --> 01:10:56.269
something so original,

01:10:56.425 --> 01:10:58.723
so unlikely

01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:01.223
as the bison of Altamira.

01:11:05.675 --> 01:11:07.473
Thank you, Paul.

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:10.302
You are a good man.

01:11:17.342 --> 01:11:19.140
He is a good man.

01:11:20.925 --> 01:11:22.643
A visionary.

01:11:23.758 --> 01:11:27.638
This kind of man always
attract the envy of little man.

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.928
I've written to Ratier

01:12:00.217 --> 01:12:01.469
to apologise.

01:12:01.592 --> 01:12:03.890
I must apologise to you.

01:12:05.175 --> 01:12:09.180
I spoke to Monsignor
of my fears for Maria.

01:12:09.342 --> 01:12:10.059
You're right.

01:12:10.258 --> 01:12:12.932
I never meant you're 
not fit to be a father.

01:12:13.092 --> 01:12:14.765
I shouldn't be near her.

01:12:15.592 --> 01:12:17.265
I am a fool.

01:12:18.383 --> 01:12:20.977
Or worse, a liar.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.769
In all these years 
I have known you

01:12:27.967 --> 01:12:31.517
I have never heard you say one 
word that you knew to be untrue.

01:12:31.675 --> 01:12:32.801
Please, Conchita...

01:12:32.967 --> 01:12:35.311
Why would you choose 
to start now?

01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:44.261
To make a name for myself.

01:12:45.675 --> 01:12:49.179
Make fools of other Prehistorians.

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:55.804
To garner glory for Spain.

01:12:56.717 --> 01:12:58.310
Spain.

01:12:58.967 --> 01:13:00.935
Beautiful and...

01:13:01.717 --> 01:13:03.560
so unfair.

01:13:06.133 --> 01:13:10.764
To pretend an 
important discovery

01:13:11.883 --> 01:13:15.342
could be made by 
a mere Spaniard.

01:13:15.508 --> 01:13:18.227
None of those could 
possibly be your motive.

01:13:18.633 --> 01:13:21.102
Conchita, I believed in science

01:13:21.258 --> 01:13:23.431
with a dogmatic Faith,

01:13:24.383 --> 01:13:26.556
forgetting it is made by men

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.473
in their own image.

01:13:31.258 --> 01:13:34.808
I risked everything I hold dear

01:13:35.008 --> 01:13:36.806
for nothing.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.518
Forgive me.

01:13:54.175 --> 01:13:56.018
- Where are we going?
- Confession.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.177
Did you just sin?

01:13:58.342 --> 01:14:00.140
To the church, please.

01:14:07.633 --> 01:14:10.136
Bless me, Father, 
for I have sinned.

01:14:10.592 --> 01:14:13.516
It is two days since 
my last confession.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:18.259
Since then I've discovered
your treachery, Father.

01:14:19.633 --> 01:14:22.386
Or should I say 
"Señor Tablanca"?

01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:24.177
Shame on you.

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.056
How dare you come 
here and accuse me?

01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:34.470
You accepted my confidences

01:14:34.592 --> 01:14:36.435
and then used them 
against my husband,

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:38.052
that's treachery...

01:14:38.217 --> 01:14:40.515
We did not speak under 
the seal of the confessional.

01:14:40.675 --> 01:14:41.972
Oh, you and your rules!

01:14:42.133 --> 01:14:43.555
To twist my words,

01:14:43.717 --> 01:14:45.890
to accuse him of 
"perverting a child's mind."

01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:48.303
What does your husband do
but stir upon thinking minds

01:14:48.467 --> 01:14:49.969
to doubt the teachings
 of the Church?

01:14:50.133 --> 01:14:53.763
His cave obscures the pure 
light of Divine Reason

01:14:53.925 --> 01:14:55.268
with muddy accident.

01:14:55.425 --> 01:14:58.395
I read your articles, 
Monsignor Tablanca.

01:14:58.925 --> 01:15:02.384
I don't care to hear them repeated,
however nice your phrasing.

01:15:02.508 --> 01:15:05.261
My duty is to protect
the Faith of the Church.

01:15:05.425 --> 01:15:09.305
My duty is to my husband,
who hasn't one deceitful bone in.

01:15:09.467 --> 01:15:11.435
You place your 
husband before God?!

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.804
Not before God, before you.

01:15:16.925 --> 01:15:19.474
It's time to make your 
confession, my child,

01:15:19.633 --> 01:15:22.386
before you sink deeper in error.

01:15:22.967 --> 01:15:24.969
Confess to you, Monsignor?

01:15:25.133 --> 01:15:27.682
And read my sins 
in tomorrow's paper?

01:15:45.467 --> 01:15:47.561
Mama, have you got the fever?

01:15:48.467 --> 01:15:50.890
No, quite cool.

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.177
Not a word to papa.

01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:20.259
Carried out by a mere amateur,

01:16:20.425 --> 01:16:23.634
this research may yet 
help men of science

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:27.100
tear aside the veil of ignorance

01:16:27.258 --> 01:16:30.307
and prove beyond doubt

01:16:30.425 --> 01:16:35.431
that these paintings
are of truly ancient origin.

01:16:52.342 --> 01:16:53.810
What is that?

01:16:54.092 --> 01:16:55.594
Marrow fat.

01:16:55.758 --> 01:16:58.386
Makes the best lamp oil.

01:16:58.508 --> 01:16:59.885
Why?

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:02.769
Clear and steady.
And no soot marks.

01:17:02.967 --> 01:17:04.935
Why no soot marks?

01:17:05.092 --> 01:17:06.890
It's a good question.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.677
A very good question, indeed.

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:18.259
Excuse me, Pasi. May I 
borrow that for a moment?

01:17:22.717 --> 01:17:24.094
Maria.

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:55.270
A lamp?

01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:58.427
This is science.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:01.344
An idea.

01:18:01.925 --> 01:18:03.893
An experiment.

01:18:04.508 --> 01:18:05.680
A proof.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.098
Do you see how 
beautiful that is?

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.598
Yes, Papa.

01:18:12.883 --> 01:18:15.227
If you're a good scientist,

01:18:15.675 --> 01:18:18.349
no one can ever take 
the truth from you.

01:18:18.758 --> 01:18:20.305
Amen to that.

01:18:22.925 --> 01:18:25.519
Now you can tell Monsieur 
Cartailhac he's wrong.

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:27.810
He must apologise.

01:18:28.425 --> 01:18:30.098
It won't be enough.

01:18:30.425 --> 01:18:32.177
He accused you, in public.

01:18:32.342 --> 01:18:35.312
No, he has all the more to lose.

01:18:35.883 --> 01:18:40.059
It's not so easy to change direction
when you're set on a course.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:43.060
I know.

01:18:49.133 --> 01:18:50.726
Think of the garden.

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:56.099
If branches grow 
across our path,

01:18:57.508 --> 01:18:59.636
we just have to move the path.

01:19:01.883 --> 01:19:03.385
Marcelino,

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:09.226
will you... will you take 
me to the cave?

01:20:04.508 --> 01:20:07.307
You never told me 
the artists were women.

01:20:13.592 --> 01:20:15.014
Close you eyes.

01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:25.143
Are you ready?

01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:27.552
Open you eyes.

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:39.393
Have you decided what to say?

01:21:39.717 --> 01:21:42.561
I always admired his 
attention to detail,

01:21:42.717 --> 01:21:44.344
rare in an amateur.

01:21:45.508 --> 01:21:47.351
Will he demand 
a public apology?

01:21:47.508 --> 01:21:49.886
He has never written
to complain in public.

01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:53.054
Then your reputation
will be safe, professeur.

01:21:57.425 --> 01:21:58.927
Here we are.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.474
Let humility be 
your watchguard.

01:22:12.383 --> 01:22:13.600
Emilio.

01:22:13.758 --> 01:22:15.135
Mama.

01:22:32.758 --> 01:22:33.884
Mesdames,

01:22:34.092 --> 01:22:36.186
I am the Abbé Breuil.

01:22:36.883 --> 01:22:38.351
This is Monsieur 
Émile Cartailhac.

01:22:39.008 --> 01:22:40.260
Dear Ladies.

01:22:40.425 --> 01:22:41.392
Monsieur.

01:22:42.425 --> 01:22:45.053
You are just as 
I always imagined.

01:22:45.717 --> 01:22:48.140
We have waited too long.

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.176
Indeed.

01:22:50.175 --> 01:22:52.269
I should have come long ago.

01:22:54.967 --> 01:22:58.221
Señor Sautuola will have 
heard of the cave paintings

01:22:58.342 --> 01:23:00.595
discovered in the 
Dordogne this last year.

01:23:01.008 --> 01:23:03.511
There is no doubt 
of their antiquity,

01:23:03.675 --> 01:23:05.723
since they were covered 
by layers of earth

01:23:05.883 --> 01:23:08.352
more than ten 
thousand years old.

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:11.019
And this is what 
brings you to our door.

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:14.804
Twenty years after you ruined
my husband's good name.

01:23:15.383 --> 01:23:18.262
I sincerely wish 
to make amends

01:23:18.383 --> 01:23:20.977
for any injustice I did him.

01:23:24.633 --> 01:23:26.931
May I apologize in person?

01:23:29.633 --> 01:23:30.805
Papa.

01:23:31.217 --> 01:23:33.015
He is here.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.139
Cartailhac.

01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:56.974
You cannot tell my 
husband, Monsieur.

01:23:58.675 --> 01:24:00.643
You can tell the world.

01:24:09.758 --> 01:24:11.351
Please, Mero.

01:24:43.092 --> 01:24:45.186
After you, gentlemen.

01:26:30.217 --> 01:26:35.178
"After Altamira all is decadence.
We have invented nothing" - Pablo Picasso

01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:39.387
Modern techniques date the 
paintings up to 35,000 years ago,

01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:41.803
even older than Marcelino 
Sautuola imagined.

01:26:43.425 --> 01:26:45.894
In the years that 
followed the discovery,

01:26:46.342 --> 01:26:50.472
my father and all our family
endured great sadness

01:26:51.175 --> 01:26:54.224
as humiliation and 
public rejection

01:26:54.383 --> 01:26:58.183
followed the injustice
of accusations of forgery.

01:26:59.425 --> 01:27:02.474
My father died in 1889.

01:27:04.258 --> 01:27:07.102
Thirteen years later, in 1902,

01:27:07.217 --> 01:27:10.141
after the discovery
of several caves in France,

01:27:10.467 --> 01:27:13.437
Émile Cartailhac 
visited Altamira

01:27:13.592 --> 01:27:17.677
and published his famous apology:
"Mea Culpa d'un Sceptique",

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:23.136
recognizing his errors, the honesty
of Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.100
and the authenticity
and age of the paintings.

01:27:28.675 --> 01:27:32.100
His honor was finally restored.

01:29:12.383 --> 01:29:14.636
Dedicated to the memory of
D. Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.802
and his great-grandson,
Emilio Botín-Sanz de Sautuola y Ríos,

01:29:16.967 --> 01:29:18.685
who shared his passion
for the arts and education,

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.768
his curious mind and deep intuition.

01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:23.803
In loving memory of Jose Antonio Lasheras
for a life dedicated to Altamira.
