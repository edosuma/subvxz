01:16.521 --> 01:18.255
Number eleven.

01:18.257 --> 01:22.092
Some players increase their
chatter when nervous or anxious.

01:22.094 --> 01:25.462
This usually happens with
extroverts who find great

01:25.464 --> 01:28.565
comfort in babbling
to reduce tension.

01:30.468 --> 01:32.135
Number twelve.

01:32.137 --> 01:34.571
Furrowing of the forehead.

01:34.573 --> 01:37.574
Furrowing of the forehead is a
good indicator that something is

01:37.576 --> 01:42.179
amiss or the person is insecure.
It is also seen when people

01:42.181 --> 01:45.349
are concentrating or trying
to make sense of something.

01:46.251 --> 01:50.621
It is usually associated with
doubt, weakness or concern.

01:50.623 --> 01:54.658
Number thirteen.
Sneaking a nose touch.

01:54.660 --> 01:59.363
Sneaking a passifying touch by
ever so slightly rubbing the

01:59.365 --> 02:01.498
nose with the index finger...

02:55.286 --> 02:56.386
Hello.

02:56.388 --> 02:58.021
Hey Gerry.

02:58.023 --> 02:59.556
How's the knee?

02:59.558 --> 03:01.658
Ughhh.
It's getting there.

03:04.429 --> 03:06.396
Good luck.

03:15.506 --> 03:17.140
Hey Gerry.

03:21.312 --> 03:23.413
That was
you on Saturday.

03:23.415 --> 03:24.381
Parking ticket.

03:24.383 --> 03:24.381
What for?

03:24.383 --> 03:29.453
They said the cops...

03:38.197 --> 03:39.363
Anyone know the
spread on the hawkeyes game?

03:39.365 --> 03:41.098
Six points.

03:42.433 --> 03:44.634
Gettin'
warm out there.

03:44.636 --> 03:46.536
It's just weather.

03:46.538 --> 03:49.239
What does that
mean, "it's just weather?"

03:49.241 --> 03:52.542
Warm, cold...
It's just weather, baby.

03:52.544 --> 03:55.645
I like that.

03:55.647 --> 03:58.448
"It's just weather, baby."

04:00.385 --> 04:02.085
Yeah, well,
it's just poker, baby.

04:02.087 --> 04:03.620
How's that?
You like that one?

04:05.556 --> 04:07.724
Anybody see that
rainbow yesterday?

04:07.726 --> 04:10.460
Table seven,
looks like heaven.

04:10.462 --> 04:12.763
How's everybody feeling tonight?

04:14.265 --> 04:17.034
That's okay by me.
Let's play some cards, huh?

04:17.036 --> 04:18.802
Iowa.

04:18.803 --> 04:21.571
Hit me with some Iowa trivia.
Tell me something I don't know.

04:22.306 --> 04:23.573
Like what?

04:23.575 --> 04:25.342
Aces are good right?

04:34.352 --> 04:35.585
Raise.

04:35.587 --> 04:37.220
Six-hundred total.

04:43.561 --> 04:44.828
Call.

04:45.563 --> 04:47.497
Call.
Heads up.

04:49.534 --> 04:51.201
Aces, huh?

04:57.208 --> 04:58.675
Fold.

04:59.677 --> 05:01.678
Thank you very much.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.413
Anybody over
here need any drinks?

05:03.415 --> 05:04.247
Bloody Mary.

05:04.249 --> 05:05.315
Bourbon.

05:05.317 --> 05:06.450
What is the bourbon?

05:06.452 --> 05:07.751
It's just
the cheap stuff.

05:07.753 --> 05:09.086
Make mine a woodford.

05:09.088 --> 05:10.253
Umm, I'm not sure
we have that...

05:10.255 --> 05:11.588
Hey, friend,
you want a woodford?

05:11.590 --> 05:12.656
Aww, no, no no.

05:12.658 --> 05:14.191
Bring him a woodford too.

05:14.193 --> 05:15.559
Uh, no no no.
Cheap stuff's fine with me.

05:15.561 --> 05:16.726
It's fine.
I got it. I got it.

05:16.728 --> 05:17.861
Great.

05:19.497 --> 05:22.299
My old buddy, Tony Roundtree,
does anybody know Tony?

05:23.267 --> 05:25.535
Hosts a high rollers game every
other month in new Orleans.

05:25.537 --> 05:27.304
Anyway, I knew him
up in Detroit...

05:27.306 --> 05:28.405
Are you from Detroit?

05:28.407 --> 05:28.405
Me? Naww.

05:28.407 --> 05:32.175
I'm from all over but I knew
Tony Roundtree in Detroit.

05:32.177 --> 05:35.512
This guy he loved to play
poker but he kept dodging my

05:35.514 --> 05:39.683
invitations to play in the
casinos. Apparently Tony, he

05:39.685 --> 05:41.785
had a little bit of a gambling
problem before I met him.

05:41.787 --> 05:43.620
You guys know about the
disassociated persons list?

05:43.622 --> 05:43.620
You have that in Iowa?

05:43.622 --> 05:47.757
Okay, well in some states you
can put yourself on this list if

05:47.759 --> 05:51.161
you're trying to quit gambling,
which means that you are legally

05:51.163 --> 05:53.597
banned from all
casinos in the state...

05:53.599 --> 05:53.597
- for life.

05:53.599 --> 05:56.800
For life. So you know what
I'm talking about, right,

05:56.802 --> 05:59.803
makes sense. Right? Well, pfft.
Not to Tony.

05:59.805 --> 06:02.606
He puts himself on this list to
show his girlfriend that he's

06:02.608 --> 06:04.674
serious about changing his ways.

06:04.676 --> 06:06.409
Well, a couple
months go by and...

06:06.411 --> 06:07.911
Of course...

06:07.913 --> 06:09.846
She dumps him.
For a guitar player.

06:09.848 --> 06:11.314
It's always a guitar player.

06:11.316 --> 06:13.550
It is always a
guitar player, isn't it?

06:13.552 --> 06:14.918
Why is that?

06:14.920 --> 06:16.853
Nice hands.

06:16.855 --> 06:19.523
- So he's lonely.
- He's depressed.

06:19.525 --> 06:23.293
And he starts getting the
itch to play poker again.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.262
Walks into mgm,
"sorry buddy."

06:25.264 --> 06:27.330
Goes over to Greek
town, "no can do amigo."

06:27.332 --> 06:30.634
Motor city, "no dice pal."
What does he do?

06:30.636 --> 06:31.868
Disguise.

06:31.870 --> 06:34.371
Yes! He puts on
a disguise. Yeah.

06:34.373 --> 06:37.607
Sunglasses, fake
mustache, a wig.

06:37.609 --> 06:39.609
C'mon. A wig?

06:39.611 --> 06:42.279
He walks right through
the doors, blows past security,

06:42.281 --> 06:45.782
sits down at the poker
table and he is in heaven.

06:45.784 --> 06:47.384
He is brand...

06:47.386 --> 06:49.553
- we didn't have woodford,
so sorry about that.

06:49.555 --> 06:51.755
But that is our top shelf.
It's bulleit bourbon.

06:51.757 --> 06:53.823
- Alright.
- I'm not paying for his though.

06:53.825 --> 06:53.823
Excuse me?

06:53.825 --> 06:58.495
Well I said his woodford is on
me and that's not a woodford...

06:59.864 --> 07:02.365
I'm just kidding. I'm
kidding lady. I'm joking.

07:02.367 --> 07:05.302
Here c'mon. Thank you.
Keep the change.

07:05.304 --> 07:05.302
Very cute.

07:05.304 --> 07:08.338
Alright, good
luck to you my friend.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.973
Thank you.
Thank you.

07:10.975 --> 07:12.809
Better than
the cheap shit right?

07:46.277 --> 07:49.012
Yeah, not bad.
Placed third.

07:49.014 --> 07:50.814
Congrats.

07:50.816 --> 07:52.882
What's the payoff on that?

07:52.884 --> 07:56.353
Nine-hundred dollars.
What's the score?

07:56.355 --> 07:58.688
Not sure.
Have a seat.

07:59.657 --> 08:01.558
The usual for ya?

08:02.927 --> 08:05.295
Actually, have you got woodford?

08:05.297 --> 08:07.664
- We have that.
- Yeah.

08:07.666 --> 08:10.400
C'mon. Let's get one of those.
Let's get a woodford.

08:11.902 --> 08:15.605
Okay, Oregon's up by six.
That's not so bad. That's okay.

08:15.607 --> 08:19.042
- How much you got on this?
- Uhhh, nine-hundred.

08:21.946 --> 08:24.781
- It's a woodford kindof night.
- What's that mean?

08:24.783 --> 08:27.884
The guy back there shooting
darts, he likes it too.

08:28.719 --> 08:31.788
Hey woodford man!
Next one on me!

08:33.857 --> 08:35.592
Poker man!

08:36.360 --> 08:37.760
I'm Curtis.

08:37.763 --> 08:40.297
Curtis. Nice, like, uh, Toby.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.698
No. Like Mayfield.
Curtis Mayfield.

08:42.701 --> 08:44.367
Okay. I'm Gerry.

08:44.369 --> 08:46.069
- Like Lewis.
- Nope.

08:46.071 --> 08:47.537
Jerry Lewis.

08:47.539 --> 08:50.707
Nope. Gerry, "G" Gerald.
Like Ford I guess.

08:50.709 --> 08:52.442
How'd it go for you tonight?

08:52.444 --> 08:54.444
- Not bad.
- What's not bad?

08:54.446 --> 08:55.812
Second.

08:55.814 --> 08:58.048
Get outta here that's
great. Second.

08:58.050 --> 08:59.883
Coulda been first. Coulda
been first if you didn't

08:59.885 --> 09:02.018
bully me outta that
Mountain before you left.

09:02.020 --> 09:04.087
I can never last in
those tournaments. I...

09:04.089 --> 09:05.588
Why'd you buy in?

09:05.590 --> 09:07.324
I like people.

09:07.326 --> 09:10.327
Yeah?

09:10.329 --> 09:12.729
You shouldda stuck around.
You're a good player.

09:12.731 --> 09:14.331
For a few hours maybe,

09:14.333 --> 09:15.899
but I-I-I don't have
the stamina for poker.

09:15.901 --> 09:17.667
- Yeah?
- Restless.

09:17.669 --> 09:19.002
What's your game.
What do you like?

09:19.004 --> 09:21.705
- Darts.
- Darts? Any good?

09:21.707 --> 09:23.840
I can hit the board. Sure.

09:25.376 --> 09:27.777
I gotta ask you, what...

09:27.779 --> 09:29.646
- What was I holding?
- Yeah.

09:31.015 --> 09:32.716
Pair a deuces.

09:34.985 --> 09:36.553
- Really?
- That's it.

09:36.555 --> 09:37.821
- That's all?
- That's all.

09:40.891 --> 09:43.960
Shit. Cause I'm usually
good at readin' people but

09:43.962 --> 09:46.429
you were all over the map.
I can't spot your tell.

09:46.431 --> 09:47.831
- You wanna know why?
- Yeah.

09:47.833 --> 09:47.831
I don't care about winning.

09:47.833 --> 09:51.034
- Oh that's bullshit.
- I really don't.

09:51.036 --> 09:53.636
I just like to play.
I really do.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.575
Did you see that
rainbow yesterday?

10:00.044 --> 10:03.012
Oh. Yeah. That was beautiful.

10:03.014 --> 10:04.614
Gorgeous.

10:04.616 --> 10:07.951
Wasn't that the most
fucking-amazing-I mean that

10:07.953 --> 10:10.720
- rainbow was beautiful.
- Best rainbow ever.

10:10.722 --> 10:12.555
How come I've
never seen you before?

10:12.557 --> 10:14.858
- Just passin' through.
- Where you headed?

10:14.860 --> 10:16.025
New Orleans.

10:16.027 --> 10:17.861
Awww, man. Man
I love new Orleans!

10:17.863 --> 10:19.162
Me too.

10:19.164 --> 10:21.631
Ohh. You're going to your
friend's home game right?

10:21.633 --> 10:23.700
Who? Tony Roundtree? No, I
don't have that kinda money.

10:23.702 --> 10:26.102
- Then why?
- What do you mean?

10:27.138 --> 10:29.939
What, you just head down to
new Orleans for the hell of it?

10:30.408 --> 10:31.808
Pretty much.

10:32.443 --> 10:33.777
That sounds alright.

10:33.779 --> 10:35.979
That's alright with me.
Dale! Dale.

10:35.981 --> 10:38.114
He just sits
there starin' at me.

10:38.116 --> 10:41.618
Okay buddy, pick a card.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.653
I'll let you see
either of these cards.

10:45.022 --> 10:47.123
Whichever card he
turns over he's gonna think

10:47.125 --> 10:48.758
it's a full boat.

10:50.428 --> 10:52.095
Aw that's beautiful.

10:52.097 --> 10:54.764
Yeah, it really was. Ha.

10:57.468 --> 10:59.903
Okay umm, heads or tails.

10:59.905 --> 11:01.037
Tails.

11:05.443 --> 11:07.977
Yeah. Again. Hold on.

11:10.214 --> 11:11.948
Aaand, call it.

11:11.950 --> 11:13.516
Tails.

11:22.092 --> 11:24.494
Where did you come from?

11:39.543 --> 11:40.844
Noo! Noo!

12:03.768 --> 12:05.602
Hey, Denise, do
you have any coconut oil?

12:05.604 --> 12:07.637
I have lotion.

12:12.743 --> 12:15.678
So, umm, your his, uh...

12:15.680 --> 12:17.714
Just friends.

12:20.651 --> 12:22.652
Thanks for the couch.

12:22.654 --> 12:23.786
You want breakfast?

12:23.788 --> 12:25.922
Dog races start at one.

12:26.790 --> 12:28.024
What time is it?

12:28.026 --> 12:29.158
Nine-thirty.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.261
Aww, shit.
Oh, shit.

12:31.263 --> 12:32.996
- What's wrong?
- I have work.

12:32.998 --> 12:34.197
You have a job?

12:34.199 --> 12:35.965
Yeah, where did I park the car?

12:35.967 --> 12:38.735
Hey, look at this.
See that?

12:40.004 --> 12:42.772
Look who's running the sixth
race: Dynamic Rainbow.

12:42.774 --> 12:42.772
Is that not our dog?

12:42.774 --> 12:46.042
Look me in the eye and
tell me that's not our dog.

12:46.044 --> 12:48.311
- That's a good name.
- That's a great name.

12:48.313 --> 12:49.812
Umm.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.754
Here.

13:00.925 --> 13:02.759
Go on, count it.

13:02.761 --> 13:04.260
Oh no, that's ok.

13:04.262 --> 13:05.662
Naw, that's alright.

13:10.568 --> 13:14.137
Thrusting a stranger, Gerry.
It's just one of those things.

13:42.866 --> 13:45.335
I think that I'm finally
starting to understand what

13:45.337 --> 13:47.337
you guys are after and
I think you're going to

13:47.339 --> 13:49.806
find this is a real winner.
Really.

14:17.001 --> 14:19.102
I am on my way.

14:19.104 --> 14:21.304
Aww, that's beautiful.
That's beautiful.

14:21.306 --> 14:23.306
You want me to place a
bet for you? They're saying

14:23.308 --> 14:25.775
that dynamic rainbow's
got forty-eight to one odds.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.076
That's terrible.

14:27.078 --> 14:29.646
That is what
makes it fun, Gerry.

14:29.648 --> 14:31.528
I'm laying fifty to win.
What do you want to do?

14:32.016 --> 14:34.651
Forty-eight to one,
geez. I don't know.

14:35.119 --> 14:37.086
Don't stress baby,
it's just dogs.

14:39.423 --> 14:42.825
You know what, put me
down for two hundred to place.

14:42.827 --> 14:44.193
Okay, you got it.

14:46.664 --> 14:48.398
Dynamic Rainbow.

14:52.302 --> 14:54.037
Heeeere comes Casey.

14:54.039 --> 14:56.039
And the greyhounds
are on the race track.

14:56.041 --> 14:56.039
Which one
is number four?

14:56.041 --> 14:59.075
Dynamic Rainbow number
four in the green. There we go.

14:59.077 --> 15:00.276
C'mon Rainbow! C'mon Rainbow!

15:00.278 --> 15:03.279
Go go go! Go Dynamic Rainbow!

15:03.281 --> 15:04.747
Around the first turn...

15:04.749 --> 15:06.849
- yeah! Rainbow!

15:07.184 --> 15:07.183
Beautiful.

15:07.185 --> 15:08.851
Look look look look look!

15:08.853 --> 15:10.119
Let's go Rainbow! C'mon.

15:10.121 --> 15:11.754
Yeah! Oh yeah!
He's bringing it up!

15:11.756 --> 15:15.158
- C'mon Rainbow!
- Go Rainbow! Go Rainbow!

15:17.261 --> 15:17.260
Dynamic Rainbow.

15:17.262 --> 15:20.430
Around the turn and down the
home stretch to the wire. It's-

15:21.934 --> 15:22.833
yeah!

15:22.834 --> 15:25.268
Dynamic Rainbow at the wire.

15:25.270 --> 15:26.936
We won!

15:26.938 --> 15:29.839
Of course we won.
Your damn right we won.

15:32.276 --> 15:34.477
Ahhh. Fuck! I'm an idiot.
I'm an idiot!

15:34.479 --> 15:36.846
I bet to place.
I should have listened to you.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.147
Aww, easy.
You still won big buddy.

15:38.149 --> 15:39.749
C'mon we just won a
whole bunch of money.

15:39.751 --> 15:41.718
Let's go celebrate,
we'll have some drinks.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.086
We'll meet some ladies.
We'll go to a show.

15:43.088 --> 15:43.086
Oh, no no no.
Look at this place.

15:43.088 --> 15:46.456
We can get drinks here. We
can meet ladies here. I'm sure.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.257
Gerry, come on. It don't
get any better than this.

15:48.259 --> 15:50.827
C'mon. Let's go. Let's
go have some fun. Alright?

15:50.829 --> 15:52.795
Hold on. Hold on. Wait.

15:53.897 --> 15:55.898
Next guy that comes
out of the bathroom,

15:55.900 --> 15:57.800
if... he's wearing glasses-
we stay.

15:57.802 --> 15:59.502
If he's wearing glasses-
just, just.

16:00.104 --> 16:01.871
You're on.

16:06.612 --> 16:07.511
Yes!

16:07.512 --> 16:07.510
I'll tell you what Gerry,

16:07.512 --> 16:13.015
never bet on a dog named
after a disabled president.

16:13.784 --> 16:15.218
I thought it was Teddy.

16:15.220 --> 16:17.854
Rollin' Roosevelt?

16:18.489 --> 16:20.056
It's a good name.

16:20.058 --> 16:22.158
No. No, it was not a good name.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.260
Next time you quit when
I tell you it's time.

16:27.298 --> 16:29.766
I used to know this guy back
in Kansas City, Archie Headdy.

16:29.768 --> 16:31.167
Never knew when to quit.

16:31.169 --> 16:33.302
Oh, yeah, yeah, I think
I know where this story is

16:33.304 --> 16:34.303
going, but you don't...

16:34.305 --> 16:36.205
Hey, listen, listen, Gerry.

16:36.207 --> 16:36.205
Okay.

16:36.207 --> 16:39.909
Archie, he owed every
poker player in town at least

16:39.911 --> 16:43.346
three hundred bucks. Minimum.
It got to point where he was

16:43.348 --> 16:46.149
asking his little nephews for
change out of their piggy banks.

16:46.151 --> 16:48.351
I see him at O'Hara's poker room
one day and I walk over to say

16:48.353 --> 16:51.287
hello. I see he's got a handsome
pile of chips in front of him,

16:51.289 --> 16:54.056
over five grand. Archie
starts bragging that he started

16:54.058 --> 16:55.958
the night with just sixty bucks.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.327
Sixty bucks that he borrowed
from some new chump by the way.

16:58.329 --> 17:01.831
So I pulled him aside and say,
"hey, listen. Cash. Out. Now."

17:01.833 --> 17:04.901
He's got enough there to pay
back everybody he owes and

17:04.903 --> 17:07.170
still get a slab at
Oklahoma Joes, right?

17:07.172 --> 17:09.070
"You're right.
You're right."

17:09.073 --> 17:11.808
He says, "I'll stop as soon
as the blind come throught."

17:11.810 --> 17:14.510
- Did he talk like that?
- Like a balloon with helium.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.412
Yeah. So I feel good
about myself, right.

17:16.414 --> 17:18.047
I'm smiling,
I go back to my table.

17:18.049 --> 17:20.183
Think I've done
a good deed here.

17:20.185 --> 17:23.853
The next thing I hear is
Archie's high-pitched screaming

17:23.855 --> 17:26.255
voice saying, "I'm all in."

17:27.290 --> 17:29.892
And he lost everything right?

17:29.894 --> 17:32.028
Of course he
lost everything. Yeah.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.462
But you know
what he says to me?

17:33.464 --> 17:36.999
Says, "don't worry, it
was just sixty bucks."

17:37.001 --> 17:39.168
Some guys are born to lose.

17:39.170 --> 17:42.371
You play? Hmm?
Pool. You play?

17:42.373 --> 17:44.874
Aww, not in a long time.

17:44.876 --> 17:48.244
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Twenty bucks on my buddy here.

17:49.379 --> 17:51.380
- Alright?
- What are you doing?

17:51.382 --> 17:52.949
I'm gonna watch you play
this big winner right here.

17:52.951 --> 17:52.949
You said you played.

17:52.951 --> 17:55.318
Yeah, but not in a long time.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.621
- So you'll lose.
- No,<i> you'll</i> lose.

17:58.623 --> 18:00.590
No, I'm not gonna lose,
I'm spending twenty bucks to

18:00.592 --> 18:02.124
watch you watch you
make a food of yourself.

18:02.126 --> 18:03.459
That's that's not losing.
That's entertainment.

18:03.461 --> 18:03.459
We gonna play or what?

18:03.461 --> 18:07.296
We're gonna play. Oh, we're
gonna we're gonna play.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.300
You want to be entertained?

18:11.969 --> 18:13.603
Fifty bucks let's play
for fifty bucks, huh?

18:13.605 --> 18:15.938
Hey, hey, hey, Gerry.
Play nice now.

18:15.940 --> 18:18.341
Okay? Fifty bucks.
You like that?

18:21.245 --> 18:22.345
Five hundred.

18:30.420 --> 18:33.189
Thousand. Let's
play for a thousand dollars.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.928
That's enough.

18:38.930 --> 18:41.163
You fellas don't
belong here do you?

18:41.165 --> 18:43.165
I'm really, I'm not very good.

18:43.167 --> 18:46.068
Okay. Hey, hey, hey,
hey. Easy. Easy.

18:46.070 --> 18:48.404
We're good.
We're good. We're good.

18:58.048 --> 19:00.116
What are you doing tomorrow?

19:03.520 --> 19:05.288
What are you doing tomorrow?

19:05.290 --> 19:07.356
Aww, I think it's
Machu Picchu time for me.

19:07.358 --> 19:09.091
Time, time for me
to hit the road.

19:09.093 --> 19:10.093
Oh, okay.

19:11.428 --> 19:13.429
Okay, well, it was
great to meet you.

19:13.431 --> 19:15.131
You too, ger.

19:15.133 --> 19:17.466
Hey, do you
want a ride some place.

19:17.468 --> 19:22.071
Naw, I'm gonna steal a bike.

19:36.486 --> 19:38.154
Hey.

19:39.189 --> 19:40.556
Hey.

19:40.558 --> 19:43.059
Can you, uhh, you got a light?

19:43.061 --> 19:44.527
Uhh, no.

19:46.064 --> 19:47.496
What's that for?

19:47.498 --> 19:48.664
Give me the money.

19:48.666 --> 19:50.666
I don't have any money.

19:50.668 --> 19:53.970
Bull shit. Thousand dollar bets?
Yeah, I heard you back there.

19:53.972 --> 19:56.072
- No, no.
- Just give it to me.

19:56.074 --> 19:57.740
Hey, I told ya,
I don't have any money.

19:57.742 --> 20:00.076
Okay, I lost it all
on rollin Roosevelt.

20:00.078 --> 20:02.378
- Don't make me cut you.
- Take it easy, buddy. Okay.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.246
Take it easy.
I'm gonna show you.

20:04.248 --> 20:05.514
Hurry up.

20:05.516 --> 20:07.750
Here, here, here.
See, I don't have any money.

20:07.752 --> 20:09.385
What? Do I look stupid?

20:10.521 --> 20:12.121
Ahhh!

20:12.123 --> 20:14.056
Damnit.

20:14.058 --> 20:15.591
Awww.

20:15.593 --> 20:17.426
Damnit.

20:17.761 --> 20:19.628
Shit.

20:22.432 --> 20:25.334
Hey you forgot
your knife asshole.

20:34.478 --> 20:36.145
Heyy.

20:36.747 --> 20:38.748
Gerry! Hey!

20:40.484 --> 20:44.053
It's great to see you, man.
How long has it been?

20:44.055 --> 20:46.022
I don't know,
a couple months.

20:46.024 --> 20:47.590
- Too long.
- Mmm.

20:47.592 --> 20:50.292
- It's been too long.
- Yeah, I know Sam.

20:51.094 --> 20:52.528
Have you been avoiding me Gerry?

20:52.530 --> 20:54.330
No. No way.

20:55.132 --> 20:57.099
Can I bring
you something to drink?

20:57.101 --> 20:59.068
Uhhh, yeah,
I'll take a coffee.

20:59.070 --> 21:01.337
Oh, forgive me
but I got here early.

21:01.339 --> 21:04.673
I ordered a salad. Order
whatever you want. It's on me.

21:04.675 --> 21:06.142
No, it's fine.

21:06.144 --> 21:08.177
Yeah, I know it's fine.
I insist.

21:08.179 --> 21:12.481
Okay, sure. I'll take a burger,
medium-rare, fries.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.550
Alright.

21:15.719 --> 21:17.486
Hey, how are you?

21:17.488 --> 21:22.324
You know, same old grind.
I would like to retire soon,

21:22.326 --> 21:26.095
but doesn't seem to be
heading in that direction.

21:26.596 --> 21:28.130
How's your real estate?

21:28.132 --> 21:30.533
Uhh, slow and low.

21:30.535 --> 21:32.134
I'm sure it'll pick up soon.

21:32.136 --> 21:34.403
Yeah, eventually.

21:41.845 --> 21:44.413
Don't make me ask Gerry.

21:49.419 --> 21:53.355
Sooo last night I had
eight hundred dollars,

21:53.357 --> 21:57.359
I go out into the parking lot,
fucking guy robs me.

21:57.361 --> 21:59.161
Meth-head with a knife.

21:59.163 --> 22:02.665
He stabs me in the gut. See?

22:02.667 --> 22:05.167
Oh God, Gerry. Put that down.
Honestly.

22:05.169 --> 22:06.836
You need to have
somebody look at that.

22:06.838 --> 22:08.671
Are you okay?

22:08.673 --> 22:10.539
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

22:10.541 --> 22:12.741
- I can't imagine.
- It was pretty scary.

22:12.743 --> 22:14.276
At least you're okay.

22:14.278 --> 22:16.145
Yes. Just a scratch.

22:16.147 --> 22:18.447
It could have been
a lot worse you know?

22:19.683 --> 22:21.550
Mm.

22:25.388 --> 22:27.423
Gotta take it.

22:27.757 --> 22:29.425
Hey.

22:29.427 --> 22:31.727
Awgh. Jesus. Lord. No.

22:31.729 --> 22:33.629
I'm not bringing
it to the school.

22:33.631 --> 22:35.598
I'm in a meeting.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.666
Ask you dad.

22:38.568 --> 22:41.337
I don't know where it is.

22:41.339 --> 22:44.273
Well you know it's not my
fault that you forgot it.

22:44.741 --> 22:46.242
Teenagers.

22:46.643 --> 22:48.511
Hey.

22:49.246 --> 22:52.181
Okay. I will.
I'm I'm gonna bring it.

22:52.183 --> 22:54.450
This is the last time though.

22:54.452 --> 22:56.819
Alright baby I'll be
there in half an hour.

22:56.821 --> 22:59.555
Do not keep me
waiting out front.

23:02.926 --> 23:05.694
You are so lucky you don't
have to deal with that shit.

23:05.696 --> 23:07.630
Gerry, I tell ya.

23:07.632 --> 23:08.664
Huhh.

23:13.336 --> 23:15.838
So, what do you
have for me today.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.242
It's about eighty dollars.

23:20.244 --> 23:21.610
I had the rest...

23:22.212 --> 23:23.879
- Meth-head.
- Fucking meth-head.

23:23.881 --> 23:25.814
- Dead beat.
- The worst.

23:27.684 --> 23:30.519
- Things will look up.
- They always do.

23:31.588 --> 23:34.223
Well, not always.

23:35.892 --> 23:39.428
Couple weeks. Couple of weeks.
Don't worry about it.

23:39.430 --> 23:41.630
- Tomorrow.
- Mmn-

23:41.632 --> 23:46.602
tomorrow. Gerry, I'll
send Ted to drop you a visit.

23:46.604 --> 23:49.672
Oh, no no there's no
need to bring him into all this.

23:51.741 --> 23:55.211
Couple of days I'll
have a commission and...

23:57.447 --> 23:58.981
- Get it together.
- I had the money.

23:58.983 --> 24:01.350
- Yeah.
- This time is wasn't my fault.

24:01.352 --> 24:02.952
I understand.

24:07.824 --> 24:09.425
Take care.

24:25.375 --> 24:27.943
- Gerry.
- Heyyy.

24:27.945 --> 24:30.679
Curtis, I know you're probably
half way to New Orleans...

24:30.681 --> 24:32.781
Crazy day, Gerry!
I ended up in Chicago.

24:32.783 --> 24:35.651
I w-won a ticket to the bulls
game shootin' dice this mornin'

24:35.653 --> 24:37.987
so I went. Now I'm back
in your neck of the woods.

24:37.989 --> 24:39.788
You are? Where?

24:39.790 --> 24:41.957
Same uh, same place
we met the other night.

24:46.630 --> 24:47.863
No.

24:49.800 --> 24:50.833
Gerry.

24:52.402 --> 24:54.870
Gerry, would you be so fine
as to order me a woodford?

24:55.805 --> 24:57.873
A woodford.
Two woodfords!

24:59.776 --> 25:01.777
You ever seen an
NBA game up close?

25:01.779 --> 25:03.412
Those guys are tall.

25:03.414 --> 25:04.780
Hey man.

25:05.282 --> 25:07.683
- It's a sign.
- What is?

25:07.685 --> 25:11.654
It's a sign. You walking in
the door when I'm calling you

25:11.656 --> 25:15.291
on the telephone is a sign.
I'm telling you it's a sign.

25:15.293 --> 25:15.291
Alright.

25:15.293 --> 25:19.028
Okay, look what happened
to me after you left last night.

25:20.330 --> 25:21.597
What is that?

25:21.599 --> 25:24.500
In the parking lot,
some guy cut me.

25:24.502 --> 25:25.601
Are you okay?

25:25.603 --> 25:26.869
It's not, it's
not, s-so serious.

25:26.871 --> 25:28.003
Did you know the guy?

25:28.005 --> 25:29.538
Yeah, yeah,
I knew him, yeah,

25:29.540 --> 25:31.440
w-we played some softball
on the weekends...

25:31.442 --> 25:31.440
That's a fair question.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.776
- No it's not a...
- Does that hurt?

25:33.778 --> 25:35.544
- He was mugging...
- That's gotta hurt like hell.

25:35.546 --> 25:38.080
It stings a little
bit but what I'm getting at...

25:38.082 --> 25:41.483
Shhhhh. Hey, Curtis what I'm
trying to get at here is that

25:41.485 --> 25:43.719
good things happen when you're
around and when you're gone.

25:43.721 --> 25:46.088
When you leave...
- you get stabbed.

25:46.090 --> 25:48.090
Yeah.

25:48.758 --> 25:51.060
I've been thinking.
You know that home game,

25:51.062 --> 25:53.762
New Orleans, dissasociated guy.

25:53.764 --> 25:56.532
- Tony Roundtree.
- Boom. I want in.

25:57.334 --> 26:00.102
That game has a twenty-five
thousand dollar buy-in, Gerry.

26:00.904 --> 26:03.672
- Which is a lot.
- Yup.

26:04.641 --> 26:07.676
- I got a plan.
- I'm listening.

26:07.678 --> 26:09.011
We go down the Mississippi.

26:10.413 --> 26:11.547
Okay.

26:11.549 --> 26:14.817
Yeah, we go,
down the Mississippi.

26:14.819 --> 26:17.553
Like huck-fuckin'-fin and Jim...

26:17.555 --> 26:19.388
On a raft?

26:19.522 --> 26:21.123
No, we take my car.

26:21.125 --> 26:21.123
Okay.

26:21.125 --> 26:24.727
Okay, but we
hit up all the action.

26:24.729 --> 26:27.796
Everything along the way. Cause
I know some weekly home games.

26:27.798 --> 26:28.864
Yeah.

26:28.866 --> 26:30.866
- Casinos.
- Sure.

26:30.868 --> 26:32.901
Then we got
the gambling towns.

26:33.603 --> 26:35.904
Memphis Tennessee.

26:38.641 --> 26:39.608
Tunica.

26:39.610 --> 26:41.577
Absolutely, Tunica.

26:41.579 --> 26:43.746
Now, I'm gonna be
straight with you.

26:43.748 --> 26:45.547
I'm in a little bit
of a hole right now,

26:45.549 --> 26:48.083
but I'm working my way back
out so all I need is for you to

26:48.085 --> 26:50.886
stake me fife hundred
out the gate-hey, look.

26:50.888 --> 26:53.389
It's not it's not,
I-it's an investment.

26:53.391 --> 26:56.425
Okay because I'll play,
you'll be my lucky charm.

26:56.427 --> 26:58.160
We split the winnings
even-Stevens.

26:58.162 --> 27:00.562
- What about your job?
- They won't miss me.

27:00.564 --> 27:02.464
Can I ask you
a personal question?

27:02.466 --> 27:04.700
Uhh, yeah.

27:04.702 --> 27:06.635
How much do you owe?

27:08.071 --> 27:09.538
A lot.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.006
To who?

27:14.778 --> 27:16.578
Everyone.

27:33.663 --> 27:36.498
I'll stake you two thousand
dollars. Your car, my cash.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.635
Hot damn. That's what I'm
talkin' about.

27:39.637 --> 27:42.037
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Come here.

27:42.605 --> 27:44.173
Easy.
Easy with that.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.676
Oh shit.

27:55.985 --> 27:57.553
Wish me luck.

28:05.495 --> 28:06.895
Heyyyy.

28:07.230 --> 28:09.164
- Let's go!
- Go, go, go, go.

28:09.166 --> 28:10.866
Is everything okay?

28:12.802 --> 28:15.571
Tony Roundtree he,
he once had a pet tiger.

28:15.573 --> 28:18.006
Won it playing baccarat
with an Arab prince.

28:18.008 --> 28:21.109
Cleans the guy out, the prince
wants to keep playing so

28:21.111 --> 28:23.745
he puts his tiger on the
table-not literally but...

28:23.747 --> 28:23.745
Yeah.

28:23.747 --> 28:26.682
Yeah, you know
jokes on Tony, though.

28:26.684 --> 28:28.884
Didn't' know he'd be
hemorrhaging money on this

28:28.886 --> 28:31.053
thing. He's got to register it
with the federal government,

28:31.055 --> 28:32.788
get a special permit.

28:32.790 --> 28:35.924
First time I met him was on a on
a bar car on an amtrack train

28:35.926 --> 28:38.060
from Denver to Albuquerque and
remember he was wearing this

28:38.062 --> 28:41.730
blue velvet smoking jacket and
drank from a copper flask.

28:44.601 --> 28:46.502
And the tiger?

28:46.504 --> 28:48.770
It was tranquilized.
Checked with the other cargo.

28:49.772 --> 28:52.007
He checked a
tiger on an amtrack train?

28:52.009 --> 28:53.709
Apparently,
they have a policy.

28:55.212 --> 28:57.546
Hey. Hey. You wan-you
wanna know what it costs

28:57.548 --> 28:59.748
to check a six-hundred
pound animal?

28:59.750 --> 29:02.551
Yeah. Yeah.

29:02.553 --> 29:04.186
Hold on a sec,
wh-what-what are

29:04.188 --> 29:04.186
we listening to here?

29:04.188 --> 29:08.090
Oh, this? <i> Two-hundred poker</i>
<i>tells</i> by Joe Navarro.

29:08.092 --> 29:10.192
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

29:11.227 --> 29:13.662
How, how often do
you listen to this Gerry?

29:14.731 --> 29:16.999
Whenever I drive.

29:17.001 --> 29:18.667
Are you gonna make me
listen to this the whole way

29:18.669 --> 29:20.702
to New Orleans?

29:21.971 --> 29:25.007
We don't have to listen to it.

29:30.823 --> 29:32.682
Hey there Gerry.

29:32.683 --> 29:37.653
Missed you at the office
today, hope everything's okay.

29:37.655 --> 29:41.823
Umm, anyway, it's all a bit
awkward but I feel I need to

29:41.825 --> 29:45.193
mention some of the petty cash
seems to have gone missing.

29:45.195 --> 29:48.931
Not that I'm accusing you of
taking it but Jenna says that

29:48.933 --> 29:52.668
when she left last night there
was over two-hundred in the box.

29:53.336 --> 29:55.971
Also, a friend of yours
named Tim stopped by,

29:55.973 --> 29:57.940
said he's looking for ya.

29:57.942 --> 29:59.341
...Fear.

29:59.343 --> 30:02.911
These soft areas will
quiver or twitch,

30:02.913 --> 30:05.280
revealing the persons
negative, emotional state.

30:07.885 --> 30:10.819
Sudden changes
in fortune triggers...

30:12.088 --> 30:13.288
Who's that?

30:13.990 --> 30:15.223
Nobody.

30:16.859 --> 30:18.760
You got any snacks?

30:18.762 --> 30:20.329
Yeah, I have
some jerky back there.

30:20.331 --> 30:21.830
Can you grab some for me too?

30:21.832 --> 30:23.165
Yep.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.167
Nice!

30:25.169 --> 30:27.302
You brought cigars?

30:27.304 --> 30:30.839
- Oh no, that's not...
- What's all this?

30:32.275 --> 30:35.010
An emergency fund.
Just in case.

30:35.012 --> 30:38.180
- In case of what?
- Emergency.

30:38.182 --> 30:39.948
A lot of watches Gerry.

30:39.950 --> 30:42.851
You collect baseball cards?

30:42.853 --> 30:44.119
That a wedding ring?

30:45.321 --> 30:46.822
Yeah.

30:46.824 --> 30:48.757
Get outta here.
You were married?

30:48.759 --> 30:50.759
Hard to believe, huh?

30:50.761 --> 30:54.196
I don't mean it like
that, just... What happened?

30:55.331 --> 30:57.165
She left.

31:04.073 --> 31:06.174
Wanna get any of that
jerky back there?

31:06.176 --> 31:08.910
Yeah. Yeah.
There it is.

31:10.213 --> 31:11.913
Jackpot.

31:13.082 --> 31:16.818
Yessir. That's what
I'm talking about.

31:51.354 --> 31:52.754
Well, hello.

31:52.756 --> 31:54.056
Hi.

31:54.424 --> 31:56.024
Can I help you with something?

31:56.026 --> 31:57.292
- I'm Curtis.
- Simone.

31:57.294 --> 31:59.161
- That's a nice name.
- Thanks.

31:59.163 --> 32:01.296
I'm uhh, I'm
looking for a for a woman.

32:01.298 --> 32:03.165
Sure what sorta
woman you looking for?

32:03.167 --> 32:06.168
She's about uhhh that tall.

32:06.170 --> 32:08.937
She's got cinnamon hair
and soft pale skin,

32:08.939 --> 32:08.937
devastating blue eyes.

32:08.939 --> 32:12.407
Funny but I think I've seen just
the woman you're looking for.

32:12.409 --> 32:14.076
- You have?
- Yeah.

32:14.078 --> 32:15.744
I've been tracking
her scent for Miles.

32:15.746 --> 32:17.913
Well. They say that
working class hound dogs

32:17.915 --> 32:19.481
have the best sense of smell.

32:19.483 --> 32:21.149
Woof. Woof.

32:23.019 --> 32:24.386
Woof, woof, woof, woof.

32:24.388 --> 32:26.388
Don't just stand there
you barking little doggie,

32:26.390 --> 32:28.990
come inside get
yourself a treat.

32:46.109 --> 32:48.376
Simone, this is Gerry.
Gerry, Simone.

32:48.378 --> 32:48.376
Hey.

32:48.378 --> 32:51.179
Alright, these were
the best that I could do.

32:51.181 --> 32:52.781
Did I ever tell
you how amazing you are?

32:52.783 --> 32:53.882
To often to feel sincere.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.517
Thank you.

33:01.224 --> 33:03.859
Don't be shy, Gerry,
we're all friends.

33:09.932 --> 33:12.334
So you guys play poker?

33:13.102 --> 33:15.103
No, we just work here, honey.

33:15.105 --> 33:16.938
What is it you do?

33:18.809 --> 33:22.344
We get paid for...
Our companionship.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.214
Oh yeah. Yeah.

33:27.784 --> 33:29.217
Hi.

33:30.086 --> 33:31.520
What happened there?

33:32.121 --> 33:33.789
Oh, it's nothing serious.

33:33.791 --> 33:35.490
Doesn't look like nothing.

33:35.492 --> 33:37.259
Gerry saved my
life in a knife fight.

33:37.261 --> 33:39.194
That's not true.

33:41.397 --> 33:43.031
Hey Curtis, how was Peru?

33:43.033 --> 33:45.367
Not yet, sweetie,
but soon. I promise.

33:46.068 --> 33:48.470
You can change in
there if you want to.

33:51.908 --> 33:53.475
Yeah, okay.

33:55.178 --> 33:57.112
Looking good, Mr. Bond.

34:06.989 --> 34:08.857
I tell
ya something Ger,

34:08.859 --> 34:11.426
first thing we do when we get to
New Orleans, we buy new suits.

34:11.428 --> 34:13.562
Aw, I don't really wear suits.

34:13.563 --> 34:13.562
Well, yeah,
your gonna have to.

34:13.563 --> 34:16.931
We're going to Tony Roundtree's
we can't go dressed like this.

34:16.934 --> 34:21.069
Well, in that case, I've
always wanted a white suit.

34:21.071 --> 34:22.603
You know like Glen Campbell.

34:22.606 --> 34:26.842
Mental note.
Next trip, open sea.

34:29.512 --> 34:31.413
Hey, what's up with Peru?

34:31.415 --> 34:34.081
I heard you talking to Vanessa,
what's that all about?

34:34.083 --> 34:37.284
I've been joking, you know.

34:37.286 --> 34:40.155
When I'm done with a person or a
place or it's time to move on,

34:40.157 --> 34:42.290
I'll say it's Machu Picchu time.

34:43.860 --> 34:45.560
Machu Picchu time?

34:47.096 --> 34:48.897
You might say it's,
it's kinda like the end of my

34:48.899 --> 34:52.367
rainbow, you know. Mysterious
and exotic, a place you just

34:52.369 --> 34:55.337
get lost and never come back
from. Plus it's fun to say,

34:55.339 --> 34:59.040
lotta fun to say. Machu Picchu.
Try it.

35:00.042 --> 35:01.443
- Machu Picchu.
- Machu Picchu.

35:01.445 --> 35:04.045
- Machu Picchu.
- Machu Picchu.

35:04.947 --> 35:06.081
Machu.

35:06.083 --> 35:07.916
Picchu.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.128
I'll be at
the bar if you need me.

35:49.125 --> 35:50.225
Excuse me.

35:51.260 --> 35:53.261
Scuse me.
Hey.

36:21.357 --> 36:23.591
Tell me something I
don't know about St. Louis.

36:24.226 --> 36:26.161
I've only been
here a few months.

36:26.163 --> 36:30.031
That's no excuse. I was
only in Iowa for a few days.

36:30.033 --> 36:32.400
I can tell you that Marion
Robert Morrison was born in

36:32.402 --> 36:35.136
Winterset, Iowa, 1907.

36:35.138 --> 36:37.305
Am I supposed
to know who that is?

36:37.307 --> 36:39.341
You might know him by
his stage name, John Wayne.

36:39.343 --> 36:41.209
John Wayne.

36:41.211 --> 36:43.979
I can also tell you
that Iowa is the only state

36:43.981 --> 36:46.748
in the country that
begins with two vowels.

36:46.750 --> 36:50.018
And that the national balloon
museum in Indianola Chronicles

36:50.020 --> 36:53.621
over two-hundred years
of-guess what-right.

36:53.623 --> 36:55.190
Ballooning history.

36:55.192 --> 36:57.192
Okay.

36:57.194 --> 37:00.061
Okay fine so-
I don't know if this is true.

37:00.063 --> 37:01.329
I don't care.

37:01.331 --> 37:03.298
But, you know when you're
in a hotel room and they

37:03.300 --> 37:06.267
put the little chocolate
on the pillows?

37:06.269 --> 37:09.671
That was started
in St. Louis by...

37:09.673 --> 37:11.706
You have nice legs.

37:11.708 --> 37:13.375
You're supposed to guess.

37:13.377 --> 37:15.010
Okay. Ben Franklin.

37:15.012 --> 37:17.479
Close.
Cary Grant.

37:18.314 --> 37:21.783
He was staying in the
Mayfair and wooing a certain

37:21.785 --> 37:24.652
lady friend by putting
chocolate on her pillow.

37:27.256 --> 37:28.456
Who told you that?

37:29.358 --> 37:30.592
A friend.

37:30.594 --> 37:31.726
Who?

37:31.728 --> 37:33.628
I don't remember.

37:33.630 --> 37:35.730
Take a guess.

37:35.732 --> 37:38.066
What are you getting at?

37:38.601 --> 37:41.302
Were you in a hotel room when
this friend told you about...

37:41.304 --> 37:42.804
I don't remember.

37:42.806 --> 37:45.073
...Cary Grant's
chocolate seduction technique?

37:45.075 --> 37:46.307
So what if I was?

37:50.679 --> 37:53.281
Six months is a
long time Curtis.

37:53.283 --> 37:55.150
Six months.
It hasn't Ben six months.

37:55.152 --> 37:57.552
Six months. September,
October, November,

37:57.554 --> 38:01.456
December, January, February,
march. Seven months.

38:09.598 --> 38:11.733
Seven months.

38:15.571 --> 38:18.473
Tell me something
else about St. Louis.

38:21.077 --> 38:22.510
Heads up.

38:40.096 --> 38:41.763
Five-hundred is the bet.

38:45.334 --> 38:47.235
Raised to one-thousand.

38:50.506 --> 38:51.539
Called.

38:55.711 --> 38:57.278
Heads up.

38:59.882 --> 39:01.483
Check.

39:11.627 --> 39:13.495
One-thousand
is the bet.

39:18.634 --> 39:20.135
Call.

39:26.308 --> 39:27.709
Heads up.

39:30.412 --> 39:31.679
Check.

39:42.558 --> 39:43.858
He's all in.

39:56.505 --> 39:59.941
How do you get a sweet
little old lady to yell,

39:59.943 --> 40:02.177
"go fuck yourself"?

40:06.215 --> 40:10.418
You get another sweet little
old lady to yell "bingooo."

40:16.559 --> 40:18.526
Bingo.

40:20.930 --> 40:22.463
Yeah, call.

40:22.465 --> 40:23.465
Call.

40:26.302 --> 40:27.835
Take it.

40:40.216 --> 40:42.383
It'a a trust gesture.

40:43.986 --> 40:46.321
I love that story.

40:46.323 --> 40:49.524
Back in in in England
there was you know, Earls.

40:49.526 --> 40:49.524
Yeah.

40:49.526 --> 40:53.761
Okay. There was an Earl of
sandwich. He was a gambler.

40:53.763 --> 40:56.864
He was standing at the
tables all day long.

40:56.866 --> 41:00.001
Aww, I'm a bit hungry. What
am I going to do? Uhh, I know.

41:00.003 --> 41:05.406
Hey, you know, buddy go put some
meat between a couple a bread.

41:05.408 --> 41:07.275
- Earl of sandwiches...
- There it is.

41:07.277 --> 41:07.275
The dumbest
name I've ever heard.

41:07.277 --> 41:10.745
What are you talking about
he came-he came up with it.

41:10.747 --> 41:12.667
You boys just
gonna sit there all night?

41:13.349 --> 41:14.616
Come dance.

42:32.628 --> 42:34.762
S... seeing. Seeing.

42:35.831 --> 42:38.333
I didn't know
that that meant Gails.

42:42.404 --> 42:43.905
First word.

42:44.039 --> 42:45.473
- Pitch.
- Throw.

42:45.475 --> 42:46.708
I'm gonna smoke a cigarette.

42:46.710 --> 42:48.643
He just won
seven thousand dollars,

42:48.645 --> 42:50.011
give the man a cigarette.

42:59.988 --> 43:02.056
Where did you find him?

43:02.624 --> 43:04.459
Poker table.

43:04.461 --> 43:06.427
It's a tournament with
a sixty dollar buy-in.

43:06.429 --> 43:09.630
He had a collared shirt
and a missing button.

43:09.632 --> 43:12.033
And you ordered him a woodford.

43:17.039 --> 43:18.973
What's he need the money for?

43:20.075 --> 43:23.444
He believes that
it will set him free.

43:24.913 --> 43:26.914
He's a good guy.

43:26.916 --> 43:28.683
That's what you
said about George.

43:28.685 --> 43:30.551
You mean Jorge?

43:30.986 --> 43:33.054
What do you have against Jorge?

43:33.056 --> 43:35.890
His name was George and
he was a liar and a thief.

43:35.892 --> 43:37.992
He was not.

43:38.761 --> 43:40.161
Okay.

43:41.430 --> 43:43.464
What's in this for you?

43:43.466 --> 43:45.833
The journey is the
destination, sweetheart.

43:45.835 --> 43:48.035
That's not an answer.
It'a bumper sticker.

43:48.037 --> 43:50.772
There's nothing
in it for me this time.

43:55.944 --> 43:57.779
Do you know
any magic tricks?

43:57.781 --> 43:59.847
No. Do you?

44:01.917 --> 44:03.484
Yeah?

44:03.486 --> 44:05.953
- You wanna see?
- Yeah! Yeah.

44:08.590 --> 44:11.759
Okay, but I'm just learning,
so you can't make fun of me.

44:11.761 --> 44:13.494
Oh, I won't make fun of you.

44:13.496 --> 44:14.996
Wait.

44:16.698 --> 44:18.466
- What's next?
- What?

44:18.468 --> 44:20.968
After new Orleans?
What then?

44:25.808 --> 44:27.508
You should come with us.

44:27.510 --> 44:28.609
Shut up.

44:28.611 --> 44:30.711
It would be so much fun.

44:30.713 --> 44:32.146
- I have school.
- Play hookie.

44:32.148 --> 44:34.849
Curtis, I can't
just, you know, like you,

44:34.851 --> 44:34.849
hit the road on a whim.

44:34.851 --> 44:38.553
Didn't your momma ever tell you
you can do anything you want?

44:38.555 --> 44:40.054
No she did not.

44:40.056 --> 44:42.056
Well I'm saying it for her.

44:47.963 --> 44:49.764
Okay.

44:49.766 --> 44:51.632
I'll come with you.

44:55.604 --> 44:58.840
Tell me what I need to pack
for this little mystery tour.

44:59.975 --> 45:01.175
Whatever you want.

45:01.177 --> 45:02.677
Should I bring a jacket?
Will I be cold?

45:02.679 --> 45:03.845
No.

45:03.847 --> 45:05.613
What about a bikini?
I love the beach.

45:05.615 --> 45:06.914
Definitely bring the bikini.

45:06.916 --> 45:08.115
Should I bring my running shoes?

45:08.117 --> 45:10.051
Will there be a gym
where we are going?

45:10.053 --> 45:11.586
We'll find one.

45:11.588 --> 45:13.187
And dresses?
Should I bring a dress?

45:13.189 --> 45:13.187
Will you help me
pick something out?

45:13.189 --> 45:17.258
And my high-heeled shoes.
And what about condoms?

45:18.527 --> 45:20.495
Am I going to have
to work on this journey

45:20.497 --> 45:22.230
and cover my expenses?

45:46.522 --> 45:48.155
- Okay.
- Mhmm.

45:56.131 --> 45:58.933
That's good.
That's good.

46:13.849 --> 46:15.182
What?

46:15.184 --> 46:16.984
Wow!

46:18.186 --> 46:21.255
That's amazing.
Where did it come from?

46:22.024 --> 46:25.026
I hid him earlier so I could
show you guys my trick tonight.

46:25.028 --> 46:28.095
Magicians not supposed
to reveal secrets, say...

46:30.999 --> 46:32.800
I'm still learning I guess.

46:32.802 --> 46:36.804
Hey, heyyy little buddy.
Oh, look at you.

46:38.740 --> 46:41.742
Hello kitty.
Okay. Okay.

46:41.744 --> 46:43.844
Yeah, you're okay.

46:47.916 --> 46:49.684
Your turn.

46:49.952 --> 46:51.953
I don't know any tricks though.

46:51.955 --> 46:55.957
C'mon I showed you mine.
You have to show me yours.

46:56.692 --> 46:57.758
Oh.

46:57.760 --> 46:59.660
No, it can be anything.

46:59.662 --> 47:01.696
Anything?

47:02.331 --> 47:04.065
Okay.

48:18.740 --> 48:20.241
Is that Vanessa?

48:20.876 --> 48:23.277
No, it must be your friend.

48:26.915 --> 48:29.216
I didn't know Gerry played.

48:34.356 --> 48:36.323
He's pretty good.

48:56.078 --> 48:57.945
I liked that.

49:07.489 --> 49:09.423
You married?

49:13.862 --> 49:15.396
Girlfriend?

49:18.734 --> 49:20.768
I have a little girl.

49:20.969 --> 49:22.903
That's cute.

49:22.905 --> 49:25.039
Do you have a picture?

49:27.509 --> 49:30.377
She lives with
her mom in little rock.

49:41.123 --> 49:43.324
I have a problem with money.

49:47.062 --> 49:49.497
Did I say anything about money?

49:49.931 --> 49:52.199
I didn't mean it like that.

49:58.507 --> 50:01.876
It's something I wanted
to tell you so I told you.

50:05.347 --> 50:07.782
I'm gonna do
something with my life.

50:10.285 --> 50:13.287
I might not have
that figured out yet but

50:13.289 --> 50:15.256
I'm gonna do something.

50:16.925 --> 50:19.393
Something I wanted to tell you.

50:19.395 --> 50:21.796
So I did.

50:31.807 --> 50:34.041
Hey, hey, J.P.

50:34.043 --> 50:37.311
Can you put me down for five
tonight on Hawaii over Gonzaga?

50:38.513 --> 50:41.115
That's bullshit.
No, bullshit.

50:41.117 --> 50:43.517
I have it, I have the money.
I literally have the money

50:43.519 --> 50:45.986
right here in my hand.
I'm looking at it.

50:47.489 --> 50:49.223
Oh, hey?
J.P.?

50:49.225 --> 50:51.592
J.P.?
Fucking asshole.

50:54.462 --> 50:55.963
Number one eighteen.

50:55.965 --> 50:58.132
Sitting lower and lower.

50:58.134 --> 51:01.535
Players who slip lower and lower
in their chars during a hand,

51:01.537 --> 51:04.572
are progressively
revealing their weakness.

51:04.574 --> 51:06.473
Most players are not aware...

51:06.475 --> 51:07.474
That's yours you know.

51:07.476 --> 51:09.410
Huh?

51:09.412 --> 51:11.579
You're a sloucher.
That's your tell.

51:11.581 --> 51:14.048
- You slouch when you worry.
- Get out of here.

51:14.050 --> 51:15.850
Hey, you're doing it right now.

51:18.086 --> 51:20.421
Seemed like Vanessa
was really into ya.

51:21.189 --> 51:23.257
Yeah, we had a great time.

51:23.259 --> 51:25.159
- Did you sleep with her?
- No.

51:28.563 --> 51:30.297
What?

51:30.599 --> 51:32.132
Why not?

51:32.134 --> 51:34.902
I just didn't-didn't-

51:34.904 --> 51:37.204
didn't feel like there
was that... You know.

51:37.206 --> 51:38.572
I thought you
knew how to read people.

51:38.574 --> 51:40.574
She was sending you
signals all night.

51:40.576 --> 51:43.210
Well, maybe I
didn't feel like it.

51:43.212 --> 51:45.179
- You like women?
- Yeah.

51:45.181 --> 51:47.314
- It's okay if you don't.
- Oh.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.184
What about you and Simone.
What's going on there?

51:50.186 --> 51:51.218
We had sex last night.

51:51.220 --> 51:52.519
No, that's not what I'm asking.

51:52.521 --> 51:54.455
Why are you
changing the subject?

51:54.457 --> 51:57.024
You know your voice goes up
an octive when you talk to her?

51:57.026 --> 52:00.461
All soft and dreamy.
You must really love that girl.

52:01.162 --> 52:03.163
You're avoiding
the subject Gerry.

52:03.165 --> 52:05.065
What are you doing?

52:05.067 --> 52:06.600
What are you afraid of?

52:06.602 --> 52:06.600
I'm not afraid of anything.

52:06.602 --> 52:09.470
What-what do ya
talking about afraid?

52:12.641 --> 52:15.175
- Your ex-wife.
- Mmmhmm.

52:16.011 --> 52:17.945
Yeah, that's what this is about.

52:17.947 --> 52:19.246
She she left you and
you want her back.

52:19.248 --> 52:20.948
I shouldda known it
was about a woman.

52:20.950 --> 52:23.150
It's not about-a woman.

52:23.152 --> 52:26.186
Yeah, it is.
You know how I know?

52:26.188 --> 52:28.055
You're slouching.

52:28.057 --> 52:28.055
You don't know anything.

52:28.057 --> 52:31.525
I've been on the road a long time.
I know what makes people tick.

52:31.527 --> 52:34.561
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a regular Oprah.
Doctor Phil. Right?

52:34.563 --> 52:37.197
I'm just sayin' that
that look, my experience has

52:37.199 --> 52:39.500
given me certain insights
into the human condition.

52:39.502 --> 52:41.368
Your experience.
How old are you?

52:42.938 --> 52:44.104
Forget it.

52:44.106 --> 52:46.373
- No, come on.
- No, forget it.

52:47.617 --> 52:48.576
How old are you?

52:48.577 --> 52:48.575
'Lright. Bullshit. I know what
you're doing, alright.

52:48.577 --> 52:53.180
Age is not the only indication
of life experience.

52:53.182 --> 52:54.982
See, I'm forty-four.

52:54.984 --> 52:57.084
- I'm thrity-nine.
- Bullshit.

52:57.719 --> 53:01.956
But I bet you for a hundred
bucks I can guess your age.

53:01.958 --> 53:04.692
You are on.

53:04.694 --> 53:07.061
Okay, take your glasses
off just for a second.

53:07.063 --> 53:08.529
Let me have a look.
Let me have a look.

53:08.531 --> 53:10.431
Oh, that's thirty-five.
You're thirty-five.

53:12.067 --> 53:14.001
I am thirty-five.

53:14.269 --> 53:15.703
How'd you know that?

53:15.705 --> 53:17.237
I told ya, I'm good with ages.

53:17.239 --> 53:18.672
My ass you're good with ages.
How'd you know that?

53:18.674 --> 53:20.708
I read your drivers license.

53:21.977 --> 53:23.310
When?

53:23.312 --> 53:25.279
This morning.
You were in the bathroom...

53:25.281 --> 53:25.279
Why?

53:25.281 --> 53:28.482
I wanna know you
are who you say you are.

53:28.484 --> 53:29.583
And what did you learn?

53:29.585 --> 53:31.218
Curtis Vaughn.
Thrity-five.

53:31.220 --> 53:33.387
Expired north Dakota
drivers license.

53:33.389 --> 53:36.256
Well holy shit.
That it?

53:36.758 --> 53:38.592
Well anything
else you wanna share?

53:39.327 --> 53:40.561
Nah.

53:44.632 --> 53:48.635
Muddy waters,
howlin' wolf, B.B. King,

53:48.637 --> 53:52.072
Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes,
there's even some famous

53:52.074 --> 53:54.641
white folk from Memphis
you might have heard of.

53:55.310 --> 53:59.546
Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis,
Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash.

54:00.682 --> 54:02.316
All those people from Memphis?

54:02.318 --> 54:04.251
And don't forget
about Justin Timberlake.

54:04.253 --> 54:05.786
Very impressive, my friend.

54:06.521 --> 54:06.520
Hey.

54:06.522 --> 54:08.789
- Hey.
- How we doing?

54:08.791 --> 54:10.524
I'm gonna get a burger.
You want one?

54:10.526 --> 54:13.227
Naww, I-I-I gotta get ready.
I gotta got to this game.

54:13.229 --> 54:14.795
Alright.

54:14.797 --> 54:17.798
...And bet
on midnight run, why? Why?

54:17.800 --> 54:19.400
What happened?

54:19.402 --> 54:20.501
How long
were you married?

54:20.503 --> 54:21.568
Eight years.

54:21.570 --> 54:22.703
That's a long time.

54:22.705 --> 54:24.338
Supposed to be longer.

54:24.340 --> 54:26.140
I like women
too much to marry one.

54:27.276 --> 54:29.109
Hey, you married pops?

54:29.111 --> 54:31.612
I've been married six
times but not at present.

54:31.614 --> 54:33.480
Here's to lucky number seven.

54:33.482 --> 54:35.382
- Thank you.
- If you want it.

54:35.750 --> 54:37.317
Miss the married life?

54:37.319 --> 54:41.088
Do I miss it?
Well, let me put it like this...

54:41.090 --> 54:43.590
I just know it's
better to not be alone.

54:46.061 --> 54:47.828
Amen.

55:59.901 --> 56:01.301
Ohh, shit.

56:03.404 --> 56:06.140
Ohhh,
Hawaii beat Gonzaga.

56:06.142 --> 56:06.140
Big time upset.

56:06.142 --> 56:09.409
I didn't even know
they had a basketball team.

56:09.411 --> 56:11.612
Rainbow Warriors.

56:41.676 --> 56:43.911
Re-raise.
Six-hundred.

56:43.913 --> 56:45.812
Raise, six-hundred.

56:58.927 --> 57:00.360
Call.

57:02.197 --> 57:03.263
Heads up.

57:16.744 --> 57:18.412
Fifteen-hundred.

57:22.817 --> 57:23.817
Call.

57:30.692 --> 57:31.959
I check.

57:40.235 --> 57:41.568
All in.

57:45.707 --> 57:48.442
She's all in at
ten-thousand, six-hundred.

57:48.843 --> 57:49.910
I'll call.

57:49.912 --> 57:51.845
She's got you covered.

58:02.790 --> 58:04.258
Heads up.

58:07.395 --> 58:08.762
Woahhh...

58:08.764 --> 58:10.464
Wow.

58:10.466 --> 58:11.865
That's a night.

58:11.867 --> 58:15.002
I did not deserve that.

58:15.004 --> 58:16.470
Sorry Gerry.

58:29.784 --> 58:31.018
Let's go again.

58:32.954 --> 58:34.655
Let's go again.

58:34.657 --> 58:36.390
Gerry, call it a night.

58:36.392 --> 58:38.425
Oh, come on, give me a,
just give me a thousand dollars.

58:38.427 --> 58:40.294
Dennis tell her I'm good
for a thousand dollars.

58:40.296 --> 58:42.863
It's a bad beat, Gerry.
Throw in the towel.

59:55.937 --> 59:57.971
One-hundred-thousand
dollars, right?

59:57.973 --> 01:00:00.574
The deal was that
slim had to get c-cup breast

01:00:00.576 --> 01:00:03.677
implants and leave them
in for exactly one year.

01:00:03.679 --> 01:00:05.078
Not only did he win the bet...

01:00:08.616 --> 01:00:10.751
...he met a woman, a
straight woman who loved

01:00:10.753 --> 01:00:13.387
his fake tits so much
that she married him.

01:00:13.389 --> 01:00:14.554
Get the fuck outta here.

01:00:14.556 --> 01:00:16.656
He's still got
'em. Perky as ever.

01:00:17.592 --> 01:00:19.112
There's someone
out there for everyone.

01:00:19.427 --> 01:00:21.561
Gerry, hey!
How'd it go?

01:00:21.563 --> 01:00:23.530
Good.
I won seven thousand...

01:00:24.932 --> 01:00:27.534
You sonuvabitch. That's great.
Come sit down with us, here.

01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:29.102
Have a, have a, have a
drink lets celebrate.

01:00:29.104 --> 01:00:30.771
And meet some
meet some people.

01:00:30.773 --> 01:00:33.173
Actually, if I could just
take moment of your time,

01:00:33.175 --> 01:00:35.008
and have a word with...
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:37.144
I'll be right back,
you beautiful losers.

01:00:43.084 --> 01:00:45.051
I don't know what it means.

01:00:45.053 --> 01:00:46.486
I don't know what it means.

01:00:46.488 --> 01:00:48.054
What, what means.

01:00:48.856 --> 01:00:50.123
Okay.

01:00:51.559 --> 01:00:53.160
This is gonna sound crazy.

01:00:53.162 --> 01:00:56.029
I was all-in, on this
monster pot, okay?

01:00:56.031 --> 01:00:58.899
I was down in the river.
I was gone.

01:00:58.901 --> 01:01:02.135
I mean I was wipped out and
all I needed was a queen.

01:01:03.004 --> 01:01:05.839
A queen.
Only thing that could save me.

01:01:05.841 --> 01:01:08.942
And I made myself a promise-
I know this sounds so stupid-

01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:12.212
but I made myself a
promise that if I got a queen,

01:01:12.214 --> 01:01:15.682
I'd go and I'd go and I'd go,
I'd go, I'd go to little rock.

01:01:15.684 --> 01:01:18.885
I'd make things right.
Yeah, with my queen.

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:20.220
You know what I mean?

01:01:20.222 --> 01:01:22.189
Your ex-wife.

01:01:22.191 --> 01:01:23.590
You were right.

01:01:23.592 --> 01:01:25.826
Course I'm right. A woman.

01:01:25.828 --> 01:01:27.461
Whad I tell ya, huh?
It's always a woman.

01:01:27.463 --> 01:01:29.596
But I don't know what to do.

01:01:30.131 --> 01:01:31.765
I know what to do.

01:01:32.633 --> 01:01:34.701
We go to little rock
that's what we do.

01:01:34.703 --> 01:01:36.536
Noo, it's out of the way.

01:01:36.538 --> 01:01:38.572
It just seems crazy.
Am I crazy?

01:01:38.574 --> 01:01:40.941
Oh, you're a fucking
lunatic. But I love it.

01:01:40.943 --> 01:01:40.941
You don't mind?

01:01:40.943 --> 01:01:46.680
Gerry, I don't-a
beautiful woman, right in there,

01:01:46.682 --> 01:01:48.081
asked me to go home
with her tonight.

01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:49.616
- And?
- I turned her down.

01:01:49.618 --> 01:01:50.550
You did?

01:01:50.552 --> 01:01:51.952
- Yeah
- why?

01:01:53.221 --> 01:01:56.723
When you come to a
fork in the road, you take it.

01:01:59.894 --> 01:02:01.828
Let's go to little rock.

01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:42.035
Gerry.

01:02:42.037 --> 01:02:43.904
Hey, Dorothy.

01:02:44.805 --> 01:02:46.706
What are you doing here?

01:02:48.609 --> 01:02:50.544
I was just
driving through little rock.

01:02:50.546 --> 01:02:52.012
Thought I'd stop by.

01:02:52.014 --> 01:02:54.247
Oh, you were just
stopping through little rock.

01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:56.850
Look, I don't
have to stay. I just-

01:02:58.286 --> 01:03:01.121
thought it would be nice to
see you know just for a minute.

01:03:03.658 --> 01:03:05.859
Come on in, I guess.

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:18.338
I was just making some tea.

01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:22.776
- You want some?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

01:03:42.263 --> 01:03:45.799
Hey, darlin'.
Did I wake you? I'm sorry.

01:03:45.801 --> 01:03:48.301
That's okay.
Where are you?

01:03:49.337 --> 01:03:53.239
We're, uhh, we're on a
little detour, in little rock.

01:03:53.241 --> 01:03:55.809
- Little rock?
- Yeah.

01:03:55.811 --> 01:03:55.809
What happened to New Orleans?

01:03:55.811 --> 01:03:59.613
No, I'm sitting in a
car right now outside Gerry's

01:03:59.615 --> 01:04:02.682
ex-wife's house and he just
went in there to win her back.

01:04:03.684 --> 01:04:06.019
And it got me
thinking about you.

01:04:06.654 --> 01:04:08.989
And me.
And St. Louis.

01:04:08.991 --> 01:04:11.691
Kansas City.
All kinds of places really.

01:04:11.693 --> 01:04:12.993
Where is she?

01:04:13.894 --> 01:04:15.195
School.

01:04:18.833 --> 01:04:20.367
That's good.

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:24.904
How are things with Gary.

01:04:24.906 --> 01:04:26.806
We got married.

01:04:27.108 --> 01:04:28.842
Oh. Oh.

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:31.645
Congratulations.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.148
Did you ever think
it was funny that you

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:37.150
traded me in for a Gary?

01:04:38.219 --> 01:04:41.221
You know, Gerry, Gary.
Wh-where is he?

01:04:43.691 --> 01:04:46.026
- Working.
- What's he do?

01:04:46.028 --> 01:04:47.293
He's an electrician.

01:04:47.295 --> 01:04:49.229
It's a good job.

01:05:01.308 --> 01:05:03.309
Wait a minute. Wait.

01:05:09.183 --> 01:05:12.018
I, that, that...

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.255
I used to be in this photograph.
That's my hand.

01:05:15.257 --> 01:05:16.790
You cut me out of this picture.

01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:19.159
Didn't want
you on my wall, Gerry.

01:05:19.161 --> 01:05:21.327
Well, okay but you,
you have to cut me out of

01:05:21.329 --> 01:05:22.862
my daughters life?

01:05:22.864 --> 01:05:24.330
Is that a joke?

01:05:25.733 --> 01:05:27.434
You cut yourself out years ago.

01:05:27.436 --> 01:05:29.102
- No.
- Yeah.

01:05:29.104 --> 01:05:31.137
When is the last
time you visited?

01:05:32.073 --> 01:05:34.741
Or sent a present
on her birthday?

01:05:34.743 --> 01:05:37.143
Well I have been having some
money difficulties, does that...

01:05:37.145 --> 01:05:38.912
It's not about the money.

01:05:40.114 --> 01:05:42.482
How about checking her homework
or making dinner, or, uhh,

01:05:44.251 --> 01:05:47.487
calling... To say "hi."

01:05:53.027 --> 01:05:54.327
You...

01:05:56.997 --> 01:05:59.265
Thank you for the tea.

01:05:59.767 --> 01:06:02.402
May I use the bathroom
on my way out please?

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.141
You know where it is.

01:06:17.384 --> 01:06:19.119
Teach me something.

01:06:19.121 --> 01:06:20.854
I'm tired, Curtis.

01:06:20.856 --> 01:06:23.289
C'mon, I just want to hear
your voice. Sing me a song.

01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:25.058
I'm not going to sing
you a song right now.

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:28.128
Please. Please? Pretty please?

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:30.263

01:07:09.436 --> 01:07:11.104

01:08:01.222 --> 01:08:03.156
Wanna talk about it?

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:06.559
No, it's fine.

01:08:13.167 --> 01:08:15.435
I love this place Gerry.

Tunica, Mississippi.

We're gonna be comped for days.

I'm not gonna let
anyone stab you.

01:08:27.014 --> 01:08:28.982
Welcome back
to players town.

01:08:28.984 --> 01:08:30.582
Thank you, Dora.

01:08:32.286 --> 01:08:34.654
I'm sorry, this expired
in two-thousand and nine.

01:08:34.656 --> 01:08:37.390
- Mm-mnnn.
- I'm afraid so.

01:08:38.292 --> 01:08:39.591
I don't see how that's possible.

01:08:39.594 --> 01:08:41.895
Can you try that again.
Go easy now.

01:08:43.265 --> 01:08:44.163
I'm sorry sir.

01:08:44.165 --> 01:08:49.035
Well I have to say I am
very disappointed in you Dora.

01:08:49.037 --> 01:08:50.670
Well, we do have some
suits available for

01:08:50.671 --> 01:08:52.238
three ninety-five a night.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.674
Can't you just, you
know, push the right buttons

01:08:54.676 --> 01:08:57.510
down there and, uhh, comp us
a suite for old times sake?

01:08:57.511 --> 01:08:58.544
Wadda ya say?

01:08:58.546 --> 01:09:00.078
I'm sorry, sir.

01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:02.916
What time do you get off?

01:09:02.917 --> 01:09:04.651
I'll be here 'til eleven.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.600
I want to meet you in the
players lounge at eleven fifteen

01:09:09.523 --> 01:09:10.990
I gotta man.

01:09:10.992 --> 01:09:12.457
What's your
man have to do with me?

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.194
That's a pretty ring.

01:09:17.531 --> 01:09:18.997
Okay look.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.200
I can get you the aarp discount.

01:09:21.202 --> 01:09:23.603
That's ten percent off.

01:09:24.337 --> 01:09:26.372
Gerry, hey.
What do ya say, huh?

01:09:26.374 --> 01:09:27.974
We can do one night.
We can afford one night.

01:09:27.975 --> 01:09:28.975
Let's just go someplace else.

01:09:28.977 --> 01:09:30.143
Why?

01:09:30.145 --> 01:09:32.011
Because...
How much is your regular room?

01:09:32.013 --> 01:09:32.011
Ninety-nine dollars.

01:09:32.013 --> 01:09:34.613
That's a little
steep don't you think?

01:09:34.616 --> 01:09:36.381
C'mon, just give me the money.

01:09:36.384 --> 01:09:38.283
Oh come, just one moment.

01:09:39.185 --> 01:09:41.421
Do you realize this guy is
the Mel Greene of Tunica,

01:09:41.423 --> 01:09:43.990
Mississippi? He has
a vip card so please can

01:09:43.992 --> 01:09:46.993
you just comp us for
one night, that's all.

01:09:46.995 --> 01:09:49.662
I'm sorry sir. I don't
have the authority to do that.

01:09:49.663 --> 01:09:52.465
Oh, that's-okay.
No. No. I'm gonna need

01:09:52.466 --> 01:09:54.000
to speak to a
manager. Right now.

01:09:54.002 --> 01:09:55.501
- Please don't do that.
- A manager!

01:09:55.503 --> 01:09:58.104
Hey! Gerry. Excuse us.
I'm sorry. One second.

01:09:58.106 --> 01:09:59.405
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:10:04.445 --> 01:10:05.745
Where's the money?

01:10:05.747 --> 01:10:07.180
What money?

01:10:09.249 --> 01:10:11.184
We're going to be fine.

01:10:11.752 --> 01:10:13.653
Gerry, your lips are
telling me me that we're going

01:10:13.655 --> 01:10:16.589
to be fine, but you're you're
slouching, like a kid who just

01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:20.093
pissed his pants in the sandbox.
Where we at, huh?

01:10:23.163 --> 01:10:24.664
Ger?

01:10:25.632 --> 01:10:28.334
Ground zero.
I tried to tell you before...

01:10:28.336 --> 01:10:30.136
Tried to tell me.

01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:33.172
Fucking cunt! I was
nailing her all night and

01:10:33.174 --> 01:10:35.041
she fucking turned
a queen on the...

01:10:35.043 --> 01:10:36.609
You lost in Memphis.

01:10:41.515 --> 01:10:43.716
What were we doing
in little rock?

01:10:53.494 --> 01:10:55.428
I can win it back.

01:10:55.662 --> 01:10:57.330
I can get it back.

01:10:57.332 --> 01:10:58.631
I can get us all the
way to twenty-five.

01:10:58.633 --> 01:11:00.500
It isn't about the money Gerry.

01:11:00.502 --> 01:11:02.602
Yeah, of course
it's about the money.

01:11:02.604 --> 01:11:06.139
C'mon, man what do you think
this is a vacation for me?

01:11:08.642 --> 01:11:10.410
You're a piece
of work, you know that?

01:11:10.412 --> 01:11:12.445
Hey, I did everthing right.

01:11:12.447 --> 01:11:14.614
I played it right.

01:11:14.616 --> 01:11:19.552
I just... I just can't catch
a break. I just can't win.

01:11:19.554 --> 01:11:22.121
This story doesn't
have a happy ending, Gerry.

01:11:22.123 --> 01:11:24.090
I think you should
go back home to Iowa.

01:11:24.092 --> 01:11:26.459
Nope. Nope. Nope.

01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:30.363
Can't do that.
Can't go back empty handed.

01:11:30.365 --> 01:11:32.398
- I can't do that.
- You can't try to lose.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.101
Oh, yeah, ye-yeah,
I'm tryin-yeah,

01:11:35.103 --> 01:11:37.437
I'm trying to-
fuckin-ahhh! Fuck!

01:11:38.439 --> 01:11:41.441
Ohhh. It's closed.
I'm not trying...

01:11:42.142 --> 01:11:44.777
I'm-ohhhh.

01:11:45.746 --> 01:11:48.781
What's up faggots.
What's up with these guys?

01:11:50.651 --> 01:11:52.351
Let's go find some girls.

01:12:07.734 --> 01:12:10.336
Dude! What the fuck!
Get off me bro.

01:12:11.205 --> 01:12:12.805
What's your problem asshole?

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.541
Where you going pussy?

01:12:16.243 --> 01:12:17.577
Oh you want some?

01:12:18.712 --> 01:12:20.179
You want to go?

01:12:53.547 --> 01:12:55.947
Where is she at?
I left something on her voicemail.

01:12:58.218 --> 01:12:59.785
Just.

01:13:00.921 --> 01:13:02.855
She with someone?

01:13:02.857 --> 01:13:05.491
Don't say that you don't know.
I know that you know.

01:13:05.493 --> 01:13:07.660
I'll tell
her that you called.

01:13:08.629 --> 01:13:11.364
You know what, forget that
forget that I called. Okay?

01:13:11.366 --> 01:13:14.267
- Curtis...
- I'm serious. Vanessa,

01:13:14.269 --> 01:13:16.702
listen to me. Don't tell
her I called okay? Don't.

01:13:16.704 --> 01:13:18.404
Okay.

01:13:18.406 --> 01:13:22.875
Can you do that for me?
Don't tell her, okay? Okay?

01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:25.645
- Okay.
- Are you gonna tell her?

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.214
No.

01:13:28.216 --> 01:13:31.484
Alll-righty.
I'll talk to you later.

01:13:41.195 --> 01:13:42.695
Hey buddy.

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:58.344
You know you're missing a pinky.

01:13:59.646 --> 01:14:01.480
How'd you do that?

01:14:01.482 --> 01:14:04.717
Some crazy bastard bit
if off in a bathroom brawl.

01:14:07.888 --> 01:14:09.222
Okay.

01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:18.831
When I was eight years
old, me and my sister, we went

01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:21.367
to live with our grandparents
for a couple years.

01:14:25.572 --> 01:14:29.442
It was this old house on a hill
and my job was to mow the lawn.

01:14:31.245 --> 01:14:33.980
It was one of these old, umm,
you know these, rotary blade,

01:14:33.982 --> 01:14:38.584
that you push it. And my little
sister she jumps out and she's,

01:14:39.553 --> 01:14:43.556
uhh, well she's screwing
around making fun of me,

01:14:43.558 --> 01:14:45.491
or whatever, you know
like little kids do.

01:14:46.393 --> 01:14:48.728
And she won't move so I give
her to the count of three.

01:14:49.463 --> 01:14:50.863
Fair warning.

01:14:50.865 --> 01:14:52.598
I thought so.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.569
But one, two, three goes
by and she doesn't move.

01:14:56.571 --> 01:14:59.338
So I ran over her foot.

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.008
She lost three toes.

01:15:08.415 --> 01:15:10.650
But what about your toe?

01:15:12.519 --> 01:15:15.354
My grandfather's
brilliant idea of justice.

01:15:28.835 --> 01:15:31.737
This morning my ex-wife
caught me stealing from her

01:15:31.739 --> 01:15:35.441
sock drawer.
Not the first time. Purple sock.

01:15:36.677 --> 01:15:38.844
Same sock she had
when we were married...

01:15:40.981 --> 01:15:43.416
I'm not a good person.

01:15:45.619 --> 01:15:46.886
I'm not.

01:15:48.689 --> 01:15:50.690
I don't deserve you.

01:15:56.963 --> 01:15:59.498
But you appeared.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.934
Like a Leprechaun.

01:16:03.537 --> 01:16:06.539
Like a big handsome Leprechaun
right there in Iowa,

01:16:06.541 --> 01:16:10.076
there you were. Boom!
And I had to follow you.

01:16:10.078 --> 01:16:13.079
I mean, boom! Magic.
Right there.

01:16:13.081 --> 01:16:15.414
And...

01:16:15.816 --> 01:16:17.817
I can't do it without you.

01:16:18.118 --> 01:16:19.852
We're in it together.

01:16:22.356 --> 01:16:24.023
I will tell you one thing,

01:16:24.025 --> 01:16:26.525
I didn't follow you down
this damn river to lose.

01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:33.366
Long way down ain't it Gerry.

01:17:38.765 --> 01:17:43.002
This is the horse.
Toto's revenge.

01:17:43.004 --> 01:17:44.737
Seven to one.
I don't know.

01:17:44.739 --> 01:17:47.206
Hey, it's
Toto's fucking revenge.

01:17:47.208 --> 01:17:49.875
Look, I saw we go with
the favorite here. Number one.

01:17:49.877 --> 01:17:51.811
- Mississippi grind?
- Just feels right.

01:17:51.813 --> 01:17:54.480
No, look. It's Toto.

01:17:55.582 --> 01:17:58.584
Curtis, Toto.
Dorothy, Rainbows.

01:17:58.586 --> 01:18:00.052
I mean this feels right.

01:18:01.888 --> 01:18:04.223
You want to blow
it all on a long shot?

01:18:04.225 --> 01:18:06.125
I want to win
it all on a long shot.

01:18:06.127 --> 01:18:07.660
Alright. Good.
Toto's revenge.

01:18:07.662 --> 01:18:08.928
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:10.229
I-I-I need you
to be with me on this.

01:18:10.231 --> 01:18:10.229
I'm with ya.

01:18:10.231 --> 01:18:13.866
No no, I-I, but I need you to
mean-I'm gonna ask you again,

01:18:13.868 --> 01:18:15.901
is this our horse?

01:18:15.903 --> 01:18:17.570
This is our horse.

01:18:17.572 --> 01:18:20.139
Aw, Curtis.
Is this our horse, Curtis.

01:18:20.141 --> 01:18:22.808
This is our horse Gerry.

01:18:23.977 --> 01:18:25.511
Say it like you mean it.

01:18:25.513 --> 01:18:26.612
Toto's revenge!

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.515
- That's our horse.
- Yes.

01:18:30.183 --> 01:18:32.585
Yeah. And... and it is.

01:18:51.938 --> 01:18:53.172
It's post time!

01:18:57.277 --> 01:18:58.911
Here we go.

01:19:11.725 --> 01:19:13.058
Go Toto!

01:19:13.793 --> 01:19:15.060
Hot, damn!

01:19:19.799 --> 01:19:22.001
Go! Go!
Go, that's it!

01:19:22.003 --> 01:19:24.103
Go Toto that's it.

01:19:26.239 --> 01:19:27.239
Yes!

01:19:28.642 --> 01:19:29.775
Yes!

01:19:31.144 --> 01:19:33.546
Yes! Yes!

01:19:35.148 --> 01:19:37.216
C'mon, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:19:37.218 --> 01:19:38.951
That's it. That's it.

01:19:38.953 --> 01:19:40.586
Go, number three. Go Toto.

01:19:44.925 --> 01:19:48.093
Run baby! Run baby! Run!

01:19:48.929 --> 01:19:51.096
Run you fucking horse!

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.114
It had to end this way Gerry.

01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:18.691
Here's a hundred bucks.

01:20:18.693 --> 01:20:21.026
Get yourself a bus
ticket and go home.

01:20:23.129 --> 01:20:25.064
You didn't bet it all?

01:20:25.066 --> 01:20:26.899
I saved one-hundred
each, just in case.

01:20:26.901 --> 01:20:28.300
So we got two-hundred.

01:20:28.302 --> 01:20:29.702
- No.
- We got two-hundred.

01:20:29.704 --> 01:20:32.104
You have a hundred
and I have a hundred.

01:20:35.942 --> 01:20:37.610
Stop it Gerry.

01:20:37.612 --> 01:20:40.613
You're not gonna believe this
but this is fucking amazing.

01:20:40.615 --> 01:20:44.283
Thunderclap is running in the
next race she is forty-to-one.

01:20:44.285 --> 01:20:45.918
- We're done.
- Forty-to-one. We bet that,

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.753
we're back.
It's over.

01:20:47.755 --> 01:20:50.623
We're right back.
I'm seri-we are right back.

01:20:50.625 --> 01:20:54.059
What about Tony Roundtree, huh?
W-wha? Hey.

01:20:54.061 --> 01:20:55.794
What about my white suit.

01:20:55.796 --> 01:20:57.630
Thank you for the ride.

01:20:58.732 --> 01:21:00.199
I'm sorry.

01:21:01.935 --> 01:21:03.969
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

01:21:37.203 --> 01:21:39.271

01:21:39.273 --> 01:21:40.673

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:01.086

01:23:01.088 --> 01:23:02.988
Darts?

01:23:03.523 --> 01:23:05.791

01:24:03.216 --> 01:24:05.117

01:24:10.023 --> 01:24:12.958
Are you hosting a poker

01:24:14.394 --> 01:24:16.161

01:24:20.034 --> 01:24:22.501

Something funny?

01:24:25.306 --> 01:24:26.905
I don't have it.

01:24:29.008 --> 01:24:30.943
You don't have the money?

01:24:31.311 --> 01:24:33.011
Uh, uh.

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.021
You're the Tony
Roundtree I'm looking for?

01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:47.025
You met Curtis on
an amtrack train.

01:24:47.027 --> 01:24:47.025
You were headed to Albuquerque.

01:24:47.027 --> 01:24:51.597
You had on a blue velvet smoking
jacket, and you were traveling

01:24:51.599 --> 01:24:56.501
with a tiger that you
won from an Arab prince.

01:25:04.444 --> 01:25:05.944
You know Curtis?

01:25:05.946 --> 01:25:08.947
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

01:25:11.252 --> 01:25:11.250

No, couldn't make it, but he
wanted me to let you know

01:25:15.422 --> 01:25:18.390
you really should let me in.

01:25:18.392 --> 01:25:19.591
Let you in.

01:25:19.593 --> 01:25:21.260

01:25:21.262 --> 01:25:25.397
I'm a little short on

01:25:25.399 --> 01:25:27.165

Travelers have a destination.

Oh, the journey is...

01:28:51.672 --> 01:28:53.472
The journey is the destination.

01:28:53.474 --> 01:28:53.472
The destination.

01:28:53.474 --> 01:28:57.142
I think I know
where you heard that.

01:28:58.377 --> 01:29:02.180
Anyway, it's good to see you.
You bring me anything?

01:29:02.182 --> 01:29:04.516
Oh, I didn't have time to stop.

01:29:04.518 --> 01:29:06.218
I know the feeling.

01:29:07.854 --> 01:29:09.554
You came alone?

01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:12.290
All by my lonesome.

01:29:12.292 --> 01:29:14.759
You should find somebody, baby.

01:29:14.761 --> 01:29:17.429
A man alone's half a man.

01:29:18.364 --> 01:29:20.532
Ehh, I think I'm doin' alright.

01:29:21.667 --> 01:29:23.702
Sure you are.

01:29:30.243 --> 01:29:32.177
Listen.

01:29:32.179 --> 01:29:34.579
This year's been
unkind to your momma.

01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:39.818
That's a good tone.

01:29:43.689 --> 01:29:46.691
I gotta get back to work.
Why don't you stick around

01:29:46.693 --> 01:29:50.529
for the next set and
I'll buy you a drink. Alright?

01:29:52.465 --> 01:29:54.766
Pete, take this for me.

01:29:56.302 --> 01:29:58.503
Life's a long grind, innit?

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.681
Alright, this one's for
my little boy over there.

01:31:22.421 --> 01:31:23.555
Pete.

01:31:26.259 --> 01:31:27.993
Make sure she gets this.

01:31:54.854 --> 01:31:56.955
Double-zero.

01:32:49.342 --> 01:32:50.875
Change, one-hundred.

01:33:07.693 --> 01:33:08.893
Bust.

01:33:14.567 --> 01:33:16.067
Dealer bust.

01:33:46.065 --> 01:33:47.966
Dealer bust.

01:33:58.411 --> 01:34:00.445
Two woodfords.

01:34:39.219 --> 01:34:40.785
Oooooo!

01:35:03.175 --> 01:35:05.710
Okay, here we go, here
we go, here we go.

01:35:05.712 --> 01:35:08.046
Hey, I got Simone.
I'm gonna take this.

01:35:08.048 --> 01:35:10.515
Oh make it quick!

01:35:10.517 --> 01:35:12.817
Hey baby. Listen to this.
Listen to this.

01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:19.691
Hooo, baby did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

01:35:19.693 --> 01:35:22.160
That right there is the
sweet sound of success.

01:35:22.162 --> 01:35:23.928
We made it.
We made it okay.

01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:25.597
Just pack your bags,
we're getting outta here.

01:35:25.599 --> 01:35:27.065
We're gonna go I don't
care where we're gonna go.

01:35:27.067 --> 01:35:29.667
W-w-we're going somewhere.
Pack your bikini, you pack

01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:31.736
your boots, your dress, whatever
you want and we're outta here.

01:35:31.738 --> 01:35:35.139
I'm sor-it's it's loud okay,
we can go, salt lake city.

01:35:35.141 --> 01:35:38.276
We can go to fucking, Las Vegas.
We can go to fucking Monte

01:35:38.278 --> 01:35:40.178
Carlo. I don't give a shit we'll
go wherever you want to go.

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:42.780
Okay? I want to tell you
something, I love you.

01:35:42.782 --> 01:35:44.549
I love you.

01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:48.052
You hear me?
Huh? I love you.

01:35:48.054 --> 01:35:49.687
We'll talk tomorrow.

01:35:49.689 --> 01:35:52.857
Alright, okay.
Call me tomorrow.

01:35:55.794 --> 01:35:57.095
We can't lose.

01:35:57.097 --> 01:35:59.097
No, we can't lose.

01:36:08.274 --> 01:36:11.843
Let's bet it all.
Double or nothing.

01:36:13.178 --> 01:36:14.579
Yeah.

01:36:14.947 --> 01:36:16.648
Bet it all.

01:36:16.650 --> 01:36:17.882
Wait. Wait. W-w-w-w.

01:36:17.884 --> 01:36:20.318
N-n-no no no. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:36:22.021 --> 01:36:24.188
- We can't lose.
- We can't lose.

01:36:25.624 --> 01:36:28.026
- We can't lose.
- We can't lose.

01:36:29.228 --> 01:36:30.995
- We can't lose.
- We can't lose.

01:36:31.664 --> 01:36:32.944
- We can't lose.
- We can't lose.

01:36:33.699 --> 01:36:34.999
We made it.

01:36:35.301 --> 01:36:37.669
Hey, we made it.

01:36:40.706 --> 01:36:42.140
I'm not afraid.

01:36:45.711 --> 01:36:47.211
We're gonna bet it all.

01:36:51.817 --> 01:36:53.117
Everything.

01:36:53.119 --> 01:36:54.652
On the floor.

01:36:55.688 --> 01:36:58.656
On the field,
everything on the field.

01:36:59.358 --> 01:37:00.758
Everything.

01:37:01.126 --> 01:37:02.794
Hundred-thousand.

01:37:03.162 --> 01:37:04.596
A hundred and fifty thousand.

01:37:07.766 --> 01:37:09.367
Two-hundred,
eighty-five thousand.

01:37:10.736 --> 01:37:12.704
Two-hundred,
eighty-five thousand.

01:37:17.009 --> 01:37:17.976
Okay.

01:37:17.978 --> 01:37:19.644
Your roll.

01:37:54.213 --> 01:37:56.180
I love this country.

01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:00.652
I just bet two-hundred
and eighty-five thousand dollars

01:38:00.654 --> 01:38:03.254
on the roll of a dice.

01:38:03.256 --> 01:38:06.958
A hero is nothing more
than the guy who pulls off what

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.694
the rest of us are scared to do.

01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:12.296
I was wrong about you Gerry.
I thought you were a sick pony,

01:38:12.298 --> 01:38:14.766
I thought I was gonna
have to put you down, but no.

01:38:14.768 --> 01:38:17.835
You're a hero.
A new American legend.

01:38:18.904 --> 01:38:20.238
What's wrong?

01:38:25.844 --> 01:38:27.812
Somethings not right with this.

01:38:27.814 --> 01:38:29.380
- The steak?
- Yeah.

01:38:29.382 --> 01:38:31.149
Here, try a little bit.

01:38:33.352 --> 01:38:34.919
- Oh my God.
- Right?

01:38:34.921 --> 01:38:36.320
No, that's delicious.

01:38:38.157 --> 01:38:40.124
There's nothing off
about that steak Gerry.

01:38:40.126 --> 01:38:41.359
Scuse me.

01:38:41.361 --> 01:38:42.827
Gerry.

01:38:43.671 --> 01:38:45.230
Can I get a cheeseburger?

01:38:45.231 --> 01:38:45.229
I'm sorry, is
something wrong with your steak?

01:38:45.231 --> 01:38:45.229
N-n-no. Don't worry about it.
It's perfect.

01:38:45.231 --> 01:38:50.268
I'm gonna eat it.
Thank you very much.

01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:53.337
- Okay. Cheeseburger?
- Yes, please.

01:38:53.339 --> 01:38:54.939
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

01:38:54.941 --> 01:38:56.307
Thank you.

01:38:59.111 --> 01:39:01.746
What, I-I-it
didn't taste right.

01:39:01.748 --> 01:39:03.448
What's the matter with you?

01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:05.450
You just won half
a million dollars.

01:39:05.452 --> 01:39:07.485
Cheer the fuck up.

01:39:07.487 --> 01:39:09.320
You know what I'm
gonna do tomorrow?

01:39:10.089 --> 01:39:11.723
First thing tomorrow
morning I'm gonna wake up and

01:39:11.725 --> 01:39:13.458
I'm gonna go see the Cadillac
man and I'm gonna buy me

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:15.727
a shiny, new, white Caddy.

01:39:15.729 --> 01:39:17.495
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:39:17.497 --> 01:39:19.964
What do you want, man?
You want a Cadillac?

01:39:21.834 --> 01:39:24.001
After you pay off your
debts, your ex-wife.

01:39:24.003 --> 01:39:25.937
Tell me whatchu want.

01:39:26.305 --> 01:39:28.372
First thing that
pops in your head. Go.

01:39:29.041 --> 01:39:31.142
What do you want Gerry.
Tell me. Hit, me.

01:39:31.144 --> 01:39:33.277
One, two, three. Lay it on me.
Boom! What do you want.

01:39:33.279 --> 01:39:34.846
Do something nice for Wendy.

01:39:34.848 --> 01:39:37.315
Good. Great.
Who's Wendy?

01:39:37.317 --> 01:39:37.315
Daughter. My daughter.

01:39:37.317 --> 01:39:41.786
You have a-shit you never
told me that you had a kid.

01:39:42.755 --> 01:39:44.021
I didn't?

01:39:44.023 --> 01:39:45.790
Nooo. That's great. I-I-

01:39:45.792 --> 01:39:47.825
wh-what-how old is she?

01:39:47.827 --> 01:39:51.195
Aww, she's seven.
Six. I think.

01:39:55.834 --> 01:39:57.235
She's six.

01:40:00.272 --> 01:40:01.973
Well there you have it.

01:40:02.775 --> 01:40:04.542
Tomorrow's a new day.

01:40:05.911 --> 01:40:07.879
So's the next.

01:41:44.209 --> 01:41:45.409
Gerry.

01:41:51.216 --> 01:41:54.185
I had a dream that we were
on a steamboat and the river

01:41:54.187 --> 01:41:56.254
bandits took all our money.

01:41:59.992 --> 01:42:01.425
Ger?

01:42:35.994 --> 01:42:37.261
Machu Picchu.

01:42:53.178 --> 01:42:55.313
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:42:55.315 --> 01:42:59.183
I'd like to check out of my
vip penthouse suite, Alice.

01:43:01.453 --> 01:43:05.356
It looks like everything
has been comped Mr. Vaugh.

01:43:05.358 --> 01:43:06.557
How was your trip?

01:43:06.559 --> 01:43:08.693
Spectacular,
thank you very much.

01:43:08.695 --> 01:43:10.661
Are you headed home today?

01:43:12.597 --> 01:43:14.999
- Peru.
- Peru?

01:43:15.001 --> 01:43:17.368
- I'm off to Peru.
- Wow. That sounds nice.

01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:19.070
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:19.538 --> 01:43:21.005
You wanna go with me?

01:43:36.355 --> 01:43:38.322
I got lucky.

01:44:12.492 --> 01:44:14.125
Number one ninty-nine.

01:44:14.127 --> 01:44:16.794
Relaxed and squared.

01:44:16.796 --> 01:44:20.531
Shoulders that are suddenly
relaxed and squared are saying,

01:44:20.533 --> 01:44:22.433
"I am confident."

01:44:22.435 --> 01:44:26.037
If someone goes from slumped
shoulders to squared relaxed

01:44:26.039 --> 01:44:30.141
shoulders I would be concerned
as they are likely to be strong.

01:44:34.447 --> 01:44:36.414
Number two hundred...
