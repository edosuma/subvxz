WEBVTT

00:23.059 --> 00:24.593
Lotta shit happened
this season, people.

00:24.593 --> 00:25.800
Lotta shit.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.251
So much shit, I'm compelled
to recap that shit for you.

00:28.251 --> 00:30.291
Also, I tested very well
as a character,

00:30.291 --> 00:31.861
so the producer
would like to shoehorn me

00:31.861 --> 00:33.234
into the show
whenever possible.

00:33.965 --> 00:35.232
Okay. Oh, man.

00:35.232 --> 00:36.933
This season's
been compellin' as fuck.

00:36.935 --> 00:38.201
Lots of twists and turns.

00:38.268 --> 00:40.271
Cable ACE Award-winnin' stuff.

00:40.338 --> 00:41.338
When we last left off,

00:41.405 --> 00:43.741
that tiny rat bastard,
Dr. Psycho,

00:43.743 --> 00:44.804
<i>had betrayed Harley.</i>

00:44.804 --> 00:46.530
<i>Turns out,</i>
<i>that tricky motherfucker</i>

00:46.530 --> 00:48.229
<i>was in cahoots</i>
<i>with the Riddler.</i>

00:48.229 --> 00:50.014
<i>And, with the help</i>
<i>of some bullshit technology</i>

00:50.014 --> 00:51.348
<i>straight out of a comic book,</i>

00:51.415 --> 00:53.850
<i>they now control a army</i>
<i>of blood-sucking parademons,</i>

00:53.917 --> 00:56.088
<i>courtesy of Darkseid.</i>

00:56.088 --> 00:57.255
Dark-side? I don't know
how to pronounce that shit.

00:57.255 --> 00:59.256
So, now, the only way
Harley can stop Psycho

00:59.258 --> 01:00.692
is with the help of
the Justice League.

01:00.759 --> 01:02.393
[gulps] But wouldn't you
fucking know,

01:02.393 --> 01:04.629
<i>they're trapped in</i>
the Queen of Fables' storybook.

01:04.695 --> 01:06.296
<i>Remember that shit</i>
<i>from Season 1?</i>

01:06.364 --> 01:07.965
Look at how intricately woven

01:07.965 --> 01:09.233
this storytellin' shit is.

01:09.299 --> 01:11.402
Peabody Award-level shit here.

01:11.468 --> 01:13.004
Further complicating
matters is,

01:13.069 --> 01:15.406
the only motherfucker
who knows where that book is,

01:15.472 --> 01:16.540
-is the Joker.
-[coughs]

01:16.542 --> 01:18.343
But, that dude's
a khaki-wearin' amnesiac,

01:18.409 --> 01:19.677
<i>who's somehow whiter now</i>

01:19.743 --> 01:21.945
<i>than when he was</i>
<i>the color of paint primer.</i>

01:22.013 --> 01:23.280
And now, our heroine,

01:23.281 --> 01:24.314
Ms. Harley Quinn,

01:24.316 --> 01:25.850
has gone against
her better judgement,

01:25.852 --> 01:27.718
<i>and has dumped the Joker</i>
<i>back into acid</i>

01:27.719 --> 01:29.387
<i>to jog that</i>
<i>motherfucker's memory,</i>

01:29.453 --> 01:30.954
so he can find the storybook,

01:31.022 --> 01:32.189
free the Justice League,

01:32.256 --> 01:34.158
and take down Psycho
and his fuckin' army.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.224
[whoops]

01:35.225 --> 01:36.927
This is some
George R.R. Martin,

01:36.927 --> 01:38.228
Emmy Award-winnin' shit.

01:38.230 --> 01:39.462
Now, get yourself some popcorn,

01:39.463 --> 01:40.564
and let's watch.

Oh. Sorry.

super power?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.000
Skin care.
He's my dermatologist.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.100
I get adult acne.

03:24.168 --> 03:25.704
Here it is. Oh!

03:25.770 --> 03:27.705

That's what's wrong.

is your problem, Harley?

03:31.810 --> 03:33.544
I should kill you for that.

03:33.610 --> 03:34.645
Good. You're back.

03:34.645 --> 03:35.847
Now, where's
the Queen of Fables' book?

03:35.847 --> 03:37.514
You had it in the tower,
the tower collapsed.

03:37.514 --> 03:38.550
What happened to it?

Oh, shit.

Who gives a shit?

04:50.687 --> 04:52.023
Where's the fucking book?

04:52.089 --> 04:53.223
I'm not helping you!

04:53.290 --> 04:54.391
You're the whole reason

04:54.399 --> 04:56.160
I ended up spending
six months of my life

04:56.161 --> 04:57.295
in khaki shorts,

04:57.360 --> 04:58.495
a Hawaiian shirt,

04:58.562 --> 05:00.665
and a cell phone clipped
to my belt!

05:00.665 --> 05:02.471
Yeah. Thought you might
say somethin' like that,

05:02.471 --> 05:03.935
which is why
I'm not giving you a choice.

05:03.935 --> 05:05.870
You can't tell me what to do!

05:05.870 --> 05:06.870
I'm the Joker,

05:06.870 --> 05:09.874
Gotham's clown prince of crime.

05:09.874 --> 05:10.874
I'm gonna--

05:10.874 --> 05:12.776
Blow up if you don't
help me find the book.

05:12.776 --> 05:14.045
Before you came to,

05:14.045 --> 05:15.545
I put a bomb in your head,

05:15.612 --> 05:17.415
and I got the clicker
right here.

05:17.482 --> 05:18.783
Hey! That's my bit.

05:19.283 --> 05:20.651
[beeping]

05:22.252 --> 05:23.855
[growls] Fine.

05:23.922 --> 05:26.922
I guess we're going
to Bethany's house.

05:27.257 --> 05:29.161
[Batman] I lost communication
with the Batplane

05:29.161 --> 05:30.161
around Wayne Tower.

05:30.161 --> 05:32.331
Master Wayne,
you know you don't have
to narrate for me.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.398
I'm quite adept
at context clue.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.100
If I can just get
a glimpse of it.

05:36.168 --> 05:37.901
I can use
the city surveillance systems

05:37.901 --> 05:38.735
and track it.

05:38.735 --> 05:40.805
-There! No.
-[clicking]

05:40.872 --> 05:42.940
No. No.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.814
[Alfred] We have a new OS.

05:50.882 --> 05:52.283
All you have to do is say,

05:52.350 --> 05:53.685
"Hey, Batcomputer,"

05:53.750 --> 05:55.386
and then whatever
you want it to do.

05:55.452 --> 05:57.088
Hey, Batcomputer.

05:57.088 --> 05:58.456
Zoom in on picture.

05:58.523 --> 05:59.656
Joker's back,

05:59.723 --> 06:01.324
and Harley's with him.

06:01.391 --> 06:02.860
They must be behind this.

06:03.593 --> 06:06.764
It's time
for Batman to... return.

06:06.831 --> 06:08.432
[sternly] No, Master Wayne.

06:08.499 --> 06:10.434
Come on, Alfred. I am ready.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.769
Oh, I'm not worried about you.

06:11.836 --> 06:14.237
I just haven't had a chance
to disinfect the Batsuit.

06:14.305 --> 06:16.507
Fine. Okay. Clean the suit...

06:16.574 --> 06:17.975
[softly] then Batman begins.

06:18.309 --> 06:19.711
Again.

[ominous music playing]

06:25.615 --> 06:26.850
[screeching]

06:27.685 --> 06:29.420
All right.
This all looks perfect to me.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.588
Can we go to
the dress fitting now?

06:30.588 --> 06:32.156
Babe, let's
at least have Debbie

06:32.223 --> 06:33.257
show us around.

06:33.257 --> 06:34.288
What's the rush?

06:34.288 --> 06:36.699
[nervously] What?
There's no rush.
There's no rush. I'm chillin'.

06:36.699 --> 06:39.396
So, I heard one of you
loves to fondue.

06:39.463 --> 06:41.766
Fon-do I ever!

06:42.634 --> 06:43.701
Fon-damn it!

06:43.767 --> 06:45.670
Oh. We'll figure out
a fix for that.

06:45.737 --> 06:47.504
Babe, are you sure

06:47.504 --> 06:49.007
you don't wanna
postpone the nupties?

06:49.007 --> 06:50.774
You know,
just until we get the whole

06:50.774 --> 06:53.778
"unpredictable flying demons"
sitch figured out?

06:53.845 --> 06:57.682
Like, I'm not even sure
I can kite down the aisle

06:57.682 --> 06:58.682
in these conditions.

06:58.682 --> 06:59.684
No! Absolutely not.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.052
I'm ready to
move forward with my life

07:01.052 --> 07:02.252
and leave some things behind.

07:02.252 --> 07:03.620
And, if we don't
do it right now,

07:03.620 --> 07:04.855
those things might
catch up with us,

07:04.855 --> 07:05.855
and we can't have that.

07:05.889 --> 07:07.692
[hesitatingly]
And... also, like...

07:07.692 --> 07:08.725
I wanna marr...

07:08.793 --> 07:10.560
You know, like,
love and marr...

07:10.627 --> 07:11.896
I wanna do that thing with you.

07:11.963 --> 07:14.732
[crying] That was
really touching.

07:14.798 --> 07:15.867
Thank you for saying that.

07:15.934 --> 07:17.233
I don't care what Psycho does,

07:17.300 --> 07:18.519
this wedding is happening.

07:18.519 --> 07:21.105
So, this, of course,
is where we'll
put the-- [gasps]

See, honey?
We're in great hands.

07:32.684 --> 07:35.418
[Joker] I can't believe
I spent six months

07:35.485 --> 07:38.322
being some
loser suburban stepdad.

07:38.389 --> 07:39.824
God damn it!

07:39.891 --> 07:42.862
I'm watering
the whole neighborhood.

07:46.064 --> 07:47.064
Get the fuck back!

07:47.064 --> 07:48.598
Hold on!
It's not what it looks like.

07:48.598 --> 07:49.834
Well, it looks like
he's the Joker,

07:49.834 --> 07:50.869
you're Harley Quinn,

07:50.869 --> 07:52.038
and you're here to rob me.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.038
Two out of three. Not bad.

07:53.038 --> 07:54.538
We're not here to rob you.

07:54.538 --> 07:55.538
There's a book.

07:55.540 --> 07:56.975
A big, fairytale book.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.076
It's hers. She needs it back.

07:59.076 --> 08:00.610
You're gonna
have to elaborate, clown.

08:00.677 --> 08:01.946

08:02.012 --> 08:04.314
You found me
in the rubble of Wayne Tower.

08:04.314 --> 08:05.314
We fell in love.

08:05.348 --> 08:06.668
I read your kids stories

08:06.668 --> 08:08.720
out of what I thought was
just a regular fairytale book,

08:08.786 --> 08:10.788
but it was really
an evil fairytale book.

08:10.855 --> 08:12.557
And it turns out
I was actually the Joker,

08:12.557 --> 08:13.557
but I lost my memory,

08:13.557 --> 08:15.192
then she threw me back in acid.

Now, I'm the Joker again.

08:20.630 --> 08:21.833
Is it any more ridiculous

08:21.899 --> 08:23.500
than pointing
that gun at my face?

The gun you think little Sofia
and Benicio don't know about?

08:47.958 --> 08:49.460
So, nothing we had was real?

08:49.527 --> 08:50.928
The trip we took
to the mountains,

08:50.928 --> 08:53.364
the walks we took at night
after the kids were asleep,

08:53.431 --> 08:55.331
<i>The Sopranos</i> rewatch we did?

08:55.399 --> 08:58.335
I guess. I mean,
I did kind of enjoy those.

08:58.402 --> 08:59.736
But, I didn't know who I was!

08:59.803 --> 09:01.038
I'm the Joker!

09:01.105 --> 09:02.874
Obviously, I'm not
going to date

09:02.941 --> 09:04.741
some suburban mom!

09:06.677 --> 09:07.812
That was a little harsh.

09:07.879 --> 09:09.179
I'm the fucking Joker!

09:09.246 --> 09:11.548
[chuckles] I mean, come on!
I mean, seriously.

09:11.615 --> 09:12.783
I thought we had something.

09:12.783 --> 09:14.500
But, if you're too much
of a coward to try,

09:14.500 --> 09:15.519
then here's your book.

09:17.421 --> 09:21.020
[dramatic music playing]

09:29.366 --> 09:30.500
[screeching]

09:31.735 --> 09:33.238
[shouting in Spanish]

09:35.605 --> 09:37.475
-[Harley] Shit!
-No shit.

09:39.844 --> 09:40.845
[call waiting music playing]

09:40.912 --> 09:42.546
[giggles] What's he saying?

09:42.613 --> 09:43.914
[shushes] I'm still on hold.

09:43.981 --> 09:45.950
[on phone] <i>Who interrupts</i>
<i>Darkseid's quest</i>

09:45.950 --> 09:47.985
<i>for the anti-life equation?</i>

09:48.052 --> 09:50.020
Uh, it's...
[clears throat]

09:50.087 --> 09:52.123
[in deep voice] ...Dr. Psycho.

09:52.190 --> 09:56.027
<i>Ah. The dwarf who</i>
<i>called Wonder Woman a slur</i>

09:56.094 --> 09:57.961
<i>that even I dare not utter.</i>

09:58.028 --> 09:59.998
God! That was, like,
two years ago!

10:00.065 --> 10:02.667
Also, "dwarf"
is considered a slur.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.634
Just FYI.
This isn't <i>Wizard of Oz.</i>

10:04.701 --> 10:06.238
[Darkseid]
<i>Darkseid does not care.</i>

10:06.238 --> 10:07.438
[sarcastically] Yeah.
Why would you?

10:07.438 --> 10:08.899
Okay, so, Mr. Darkseid, sir,

10:08.899 --> 10:11.275
I have recently
taken over Gotham City

10:11.342 --> 10:14.745
after organizing
all your parademons, and--

10:14.812 --> 10:16.181
<i>What is your request?</i>

10:16.181 --> 10:18.450
Okay, I'd like that deal that
you made with Harley Quinn.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.251
The one that said
if she took over Gotham,

10:20.317 --> 10:22.620
you'd help her
take over the world.

10:22.687 --> 10:25.956
<i>Darkseid is...</i>
<i>late for a meeting.</i>

10:26.024 --> 10:27.792
All right.
I'm gonna make this quick.

10:27.859 --> 10:28.993
<i>When I was a little boy,</i>

10:28.993 --> 10:30.861
<i>my mother brought me</i>
<i>to the county fair.</i>

10:30.861 --> 10:31.995
<i>There was a Ferris wheel.</i>

10:32.062 --> 10:33.298
<i>A big, beautiful thing,</i>

10:33.298 --> 10:35.366
<i>and you had to be</i>
<i>a certain height to ride it.</i>

10:35.366 --> 10:37.067
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>I was too short.</i>

10:37.067 --> 10:38.470
<i>But, my mother</i>
<i>would always say,</i>

10:38.470 --> 10:40.004
[in high-pitched voice]
<i>"Patience, Eddie.</i>

10:40.004 --> 10:42.673
<i>I'm sure next year</i>
<i>you're gonna be big enough."</i>

10:42.673 --> 10:43.740
<i>Let me tell you right now.</i>

10:43.807 --> 10:45.576
<i>The next year rolled around,</i>

10:45.576 --> 10:47.778
and I hadn't gotten any taller.

10:47.845 --> 10:49.147
<i>Years went by.</i>

10:49.214 --> 10:53.017
<i>I hung upside down</i>
<i>from my ankles for hours.</i>

10:53.083 --> 10:55.052
<i>I took growth hormones.</i>

10:55.120 --> 10:59.090
<i>Anything to ride</i>
<i>that big wheel in the sky.</i>

10:59.157 --> 11:00.591
<i>I never did get there.</i>

11:00.658 --> 11:01.658
<i>But, then, one day,</i>

11:01.725 --> 11:04.095
<i>somethin' very</i>
<i>unexpected happened.</i>

11:04.162 --> 11:06.331
[giggling] <i>All those people</i>

11:06.398 --> 11:07.966
<i>fell to their death!</i>

11:08.032 --> 11:09.801
[all screaming]

11:09.866 --> 11:12.736
[growling] <i>And it was a rush!</i>

11:12.803 --> 11:15.105
I thought it was so satisfying

11:15.173 --> 11:17.808
to watch all those people die!

11:17.875 --> 11:19.610
And, that's when
I decided to hate women.

11:19.677 --> 11:21.778
<i>I'm not sure that tracks.</i>

11:21.846 --> 11:23.815
But, you get
where I'm comin' from.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.950
[Darkseid] <i>I will end</i>
<i>this transmission now.</i>

11:26.017 --> 11:27.551
[softly] Wait! Wait! Wait!

11:27.618 --> 11:30.254
Most insomniacs who
stay up all hours of the night

11:30.322 --> 11:32.923
doing deep dives on Wikipedia
would tell you

11:32.990 --> 11:35.960
that 87% of apocalyptian
business transactions

11:36.027 --> 11:37.961
are fueled by revenge.

11:38.028 --> 11:40.398
So, I was thinking--

11:40.399 --> 11:41.399
-[laughing]
-What?

11:41.399 --> 11:43.600
Why are you
looking at me all weird?

11:43.668 --> 11:44.936
I just read your mind.

11:45.003 --> 11:47.038
What? That's creepy, man.

11:47.105 --> 11:51.975
Sir, what if I bring you
the head of Harley Quinn?

11:52.043 --> 11:53.410
I mean, she did break the terms

11:53.477 --> 11:55.179
of her
original agreement with you,

11:55.245 --> 11:57.481
and it seems like a good reason
to want her dead.

11:57.548 --> 11:59.518
[Darkseid] <i>You would</i>
<i>vanquish the woman</i>

11:59.518 --> 12:00.518
<i>who betrayed me?</i>

12:00.583 --> 12:02.620
[chuckles] Yeah! Of course.

12:02.620 --> 12:05.456
I mean, we're already
in the process of that.

12:05.456 --> 12:06.662
We're mid-vanquish.

12:06.662 --> 12:09.360
<i>Bring me the head</i>
<i>of Harley Quinn,</i>

12:09.360 --> 12:10.628
<i>and the Earth...</i>

12:11.229 --> 12:12.763
<i>is yours.</i>

12:12.830 --> 12:15.200
[excitedly] Yes! Fuckin' sweet!

12:15.265 --> 12:18.001
-I mean, it will be done.
-[cell phone beeps]

12:18.068 --> 12:21.572
Oh. Soon, the whole world

12:21.572 --> 12:24.174
is gonna bow before me.

12:24.241 --> 12:27.345
Bring me Harley Quinn!

12:27.412 --> 12:28.712
[screeches]

12:29.580 --> 12:31.349
God, your calves are huge!

12:31.349 --> 12:32.349
[squeaking]

12:32.615 --> 12:33.985
[screeching]

12:34.052 --> 12:35.220
[music playing on speaker]

12:38.222 --> 12:39.524
[Poison Ivy] What do you think?

12:41.058 --> 12:44.328
I think this is
highly against protocol.

12:44.395 --> 12:46.029
If my mother saw me seeing you

12:46.029 --> 12:47.365
in that dress
before the wedding,

12:47.365 --> 12:49.100
she would say something
very passive-aggressive

12:49.100 --> 12:50.301
that would bring me to tears.

12:50.368 --> 12:51.535
Where is Harley?

12:51.535 --> 12:53.136
She should be here. Not me.

12:53.203 --> 12:55.072
What? Forget about Harley.
She was busy,

12:55.072 --> 12:56.639
and I don't have
any other friends,
so you're up.

12:56.639 --> 12:59.076
Babe, did you and Harley
get into a fight or something

12:59.143 --> 13:00.544
at the ol' bach partay?

13:00.611 --> 13:02.879
It just feels like
you've been different
since then.

13:02.947 --> 13:04.782
What? No.
We're, like, totally fine.

13:04.782 --> 13:05.899
[stammering] We just... She...

13:05.899 --> 13:07.618
She's just got her things,
and I've got mine.

13:07.618 --> 13:10.187
It's a classic case of, like,
people just, you know,
havin' things

13:10.187 --> 13:11.822
that they do away from people.

13:11.822 --> 13:13.424
Plus, she's like
not good at this stuff.

13:13.424 --> 13:14.792
You know, it's like, you are.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.094
You are good
at this kind of thing.

13:16.094 --> 13:18.296
You are right about that.

13:18.363 --> 13:20.697
[inhales] Okay. Um...
[clicks tongue]

13:20.700 --> 13:22.799
Are you totally set on cream?

13:22.866 --> 13:23.868
What? What do you mean?

13:23.899 --> 13:25.635
-The... Isn't this just white?
-Nope.

13:25.702 --> 13:27.672
-[screeching]
-Oh, shit!

13:27.938 --> 13:29.240
[grunts]

13:30.408 --> 13:31.442
[screeching]

13:31.509 --> 13:34.846
[speaking slowly]
We don't speak your language.

13:34.912 --> 13:36.714
Is there another way

13:36.714 --> 13:39.183
we can communicate?

13:39.250 --> 13:40.750
You do know
that speaking louder

13:40.750 --> 13:42.386
will not help them
understand you.

13:42.453 --> 13:43.721
It... might.

13:45.755 --> 13:47.024
What the fuck?

13:47.091 --> 13:48.759
Shit nuts with a can!

13:48.826 --> 13:49.961
Oh, my God!

13:49.961 --> 13:51.395
I wasn't even sure
I wanted a backless dress,

13:51.395 --> 13:52.596
and now I'm stuck with it.

13:52.663 --> 13:53.865
Yeah. I was gonna say,

13:53.931 --> 13:56.667
a backless halter...
is a little rural.

13:56.734 --> 13:57.735
[growls]

13:59.003 --> 14:00.504
[growling] I've had it!

14:00.572 --> 14:02.874
I didn't care when
they were taking giant dumps

14:02.940 --> 14:04.142
all over the fuckin' city,

14:04.208 --> 14:07.077
but this is
a $13,000 Vera Wang!

14:07.144 --> 14:09.480
[nervously] Uh...
Okay. Thirteen...

14:09.548 --> 14:12.517
So, you know,
are we doin'
the traditional thing

14:12.517 --> 14:14.152
where the bride's parents
pay for the wedding?

14:14.152 --> 14:15.653
Dr. Psycho's dead.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.721
Hold my hair.

14:16.787 --> 14:18.022
Yeah. Sure, honey.

14:18.089 --> 14:21.688
[menacing music playing]

14:23.260 --> 14:24.461
[suspenseful music playing]

14:26.230 --> 14:27.365
[Harley shouts] Get down!

14:27.432 --> 14:28.899
[screeching]

14:28.966 --> 14:31.701
We're not going
to find this book.

14:31.769 --> 14:33.303
Ugh. This sucks!

14:33.303 --> 14:35.139
Why don't you just
blow my head up right now?

14:35.139 --> 14:36.408
[angrily] It's your fault
we're here.

14:36.408 --> 14:37.875
If you hadn't been
an asshole to your ex,

14:37.875 --> 14:38.942
she wouldn't have
chucked the book

14:38.942 --> 14:40.500
into the jaws of a parademon.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.645
She chucked the book

14:41.712 --> 14:43.081
because she's <i>loca.</i>

14:43.147 --> 14:45.082
She's got it tattooed
on her lower back

14:45.149 --> 14:46.918
next to a Tweety Bird.

14:46.984 --> 14:49.254
Although, we did have
some good times.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.754
Great. Uh, I don't give a shit.

14:50.754 --> 14:51.788
Let's find the book.

14:51.788 --> 14:52.724
[squelching]

14:52.724 --> 14:54.892
I might actually say

14:54.958 --> 14:57.095
it was the
most fulfilling relationship

14:57.095 --> 14:58.196
I've been in.

14:58.196 --> 15:00.498
Jesus Christ!
Are you gettin' sentimental?

15:00.565 --> 15:02.100
Where was that
when we were dating?

15:02.166 --> 15:04.501
You fell in love with me
when I was famous.

15:04.568 --> 15:07.705
When I looked like this.
[chuckles]

15:07.772 --> 15:08.940
Bethany fell in love with me

15:09.005 --> 15:11.308
when I was just
a square-looking barback

15:11.375 --> 15:13.711
with not a lot of prospects.

15:13.778 --> 15:15.513
Uh, that wasn't the real you!

15:15.513 --> 15:17.615
[shouting] You had forgotten
what a piece of shit you are!

15:17.615 --> 15:20.585
I can't believe
you were ever a therapist.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.489
I'm starting to wonder,

15:24.556 --> 15:26.957
did I screw
something up good

15:26.957 --> 15:28.460
with me and Bethany?

15:28.525 --> 15:29.562
Probably not.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.263
Just seeing you toss away
your chance at Ivy has...

15:32.330 --> 15:34.764
Has got me thinking
about my own love life.

15:34.831 --> 15:37.033
I mean, I don't wanna
biff it like you did.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.836
Hey! I told Ivy how I felt,

15:38.836 --> 15:39.836
and she didn't feel that way.

15:39.836 --> 15:40.836
[shouting] And end of story!

15:40.837 --> 15:41.905
Water under the bridge!

15:41.905 --> 15:43.240
Right. Right.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.842
[sarcastically]
The screaming about it at
the mere mention of her name

15:45.842 --> 15:47.578
certainly backs that up.

15:48.211 --> 15:53.017
[screeching in distance]

15:53.017 --> 15:54.184
Fuck, yeah!

15:54.451 --> 15:55.802
[snoring]

15:59.789 --> 16:02.494
Look at these hideous monsters.

16:02.559 --> 16:05.895
Oh, Bethany and I
used to cuddle just like that.

16:05.962 --> 16:08.265
God, we could just
sit on the couch

16:08.332 --> 16:10.400
<i>and talk about nothing</i>
<i>for hours.</i>

16:10.467 --> 16:13.437
<i>We just got each other.</i>

16:13.504 --> 16:15.440
<i>She always had my back.</i>

16:15.506 --> 16:16.606
[sentimental music playing]

16:17.908 --> 16:19.177
Good God!

16:19.243 --> 16:20.445
That's true love.

16:20.511 --> 16:22.113
Then you can't just give up.

16:22.179 --> 16:23.413
Love's a risk.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.048
It may not always
go in your favor,

16:25.115 --> 16:26.350
but if it's true love,

16:26.417 --> 16:28.186
you have to fight for it.

16:28.452 --> 16:29.721
[belches]

16:29.788 --> 16:31.322
That is foul.

16:31.389 --> 16:33.057
Ugh! Let's get
the hell outta here.

16:33.124 --> 16:37.173
[suspenseful music playing]

16:39.129 --> 16:40.298
[growling]

16:40.365 --> 16:42.033
Maybe it's T. rex rules.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.868
If we don't move,
they can't see us.

16:43.934 --> 16:46.270
[screeching]

16:46.336 --> 16:48.306
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
they can see us.

16:48.373 --> 16:49.707
[growling and screeching]

16:50.140 --> 16:51.241
[grunts]

16:51.308 --> 16:53.544
I can't run
in fucking wingtips.

17:10.094 --> 17:11.563
[shrieks]

17:13.163 --> 17:14.963
[screeching]

17:36.988 --> 17:37.988
[Joker grunts]

17:38.789 --> 17:40.592
[both panting]

17:40.924 --> 17:41.924
[screeching]

17:44.461 --> 17:48.261
Nice knowin' ya, Mistah J.

17:49.933 --> 17:51.035
[screeching]

17:51.102 --> 17:55.071
[dramatic music playing]

17:55.071 --> 17:57.141
So, you're all
in league with Psycho,

17:57.208 --> 17:58.844
and you've
gotten back with Joker.

17:58.910 --> 18:00.044
Oh for two, idiot.

18:00.111 --> 18:01.346
Jesus, Bats.

18:01.412 --> 18:02.814
Your time out of the game

18:02.815 --> 18:05.482
has really made
your detective skills
go to shit.

18:05.549 --> 18:06.584
[Batman] I doubt that.

18:06.584 --> 18:07.719
[Harley] We're trying
to save the city.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.220
Psycho's mind-controlled
my crew

18:09.287 --> 18:10.320
and all the parademons.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.422
And, in order to stop him,

18:11.422 --> 18:12.990
we're trying
to free the Justice League

18:13.057 --> 18:14.759
-from Queen of Fables' book.
-Oh.

18:14.826 --> 18:17.928
[growls] Oh!
That is not the book.

18:17.994 --> 18:20.365
What? Then the actual book is--

18:20.431 --> 18:21.766
[shouting] Still at Bethany's!

18:21.833 --> 18:24.201
Looks like we're
takin' a detour to suburbia.

18:24.268 --> 18:26.103
Bats, tell Zatanna
to meet us there,

18:26.170 --> 18:27.204
and bring her wand.

18:27.270 --> 18:29.140
-Who's Bethany?
-My girlfriend.

18:29.207 --> 18:31.809
-What?
-My ex-girlfriend!

18:31.809 --> 18:33.411
I'll explain on the way.

18:36.012 --> 18:37.114
[screeching]

18:37.181 --> 18:39.450
Okay. You're tellin' me

18:39.517 --> 18:41.018
that Harley and Joker

18:41.018 --> 18:42.854
were in the goddamn nest,

18:42.921 --> 18:45.088
but escaped with Batman?

18:45.155 --> 18:46.457
[screeching]

18:46.523 --> 18:49.527
And, they're headed east
in the fuckin' Batplane?

18:49.594 --> 18:51.429
-[screeches]
-Northeast. Whatever.

18:51.496 --> 18:53.196
Shit! What the hell
are we gonna do?

18:53.263 --> 18:55.799
-Batman was supposed
to be out of commission!
-[crashing]

18:56.667 --> 18:57.968
Hey, Psycho!

18:58.035 --> 18:59.837
You tiny-dicked asshole.

18:59.904 --> 19:02.173
I was tryin'
to just sit this one out,

19:02.240 --> 19:04.541
but you screwed with
my goddamn wedding.

19:04.608 --> 19:07.478
So, either ground
your goddamn parademons

19:07.545 --> 19:09.247
until the "I do's" are done,

19:09.313 --> 19:11.214
-or so help me--
-Oh!

19:11.281 --> 19:15.086
Actually, I'm so happy
you came, Ivy.

19:15.152 --> 19:18.154
I was really
in need of a friend.

19:18.221 --> 19:20.124
[whirring]

19:21.491 --> 19:23.894
[Batman] So, you, the Joker,

19:23.961 --> 19:26.530
were in a relationship
with a nurse practitioner.

19:26.597 --> 19:29.232
Technically, she was
in nursing school.

19:29.299 --> 19:31.435
And you professed
your love to Ivy.

19:31.501 --> 19:33.671
Ugh! Still don't know
why you brought that up.

19:33.671 --> 19:34.538
Oh, my God!

19:34.538 --> 19:35.869
It came up organically.

19:35.869 --> 19:38.241
It would've been awkward
if I didn't say anything.

19:38.308 --> 19:41.578
Look, we need to get that book
before Psycho kills us all.

19:41.645 --> 19:45.048
No. This is mine to do.

19:47.952 --> 19:49.086
[knocking]

19:50.520 --> 19:52.123
Didn't I tell you
to fuck off and get lost?

19:52.123 --> 19:55.660
Yes. Yes, you most definitely
said both of those things,

19:55.727 --> 19:56.728
but, um...

19:56.795 --> 19:59.964
I just can't stay away, Beth.

20:00.031 --> 20:02.968
You know, I thought
I had the perfect life

20:03.035 --> 20:04.368
before I met you.

20:04.434 --> 20:07.238
Maiming, killing,
causing general chaos.

20:07.305 --> 20:08.973
I thought I had it all.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.008
But, now, I realize...

20:11.075 --> 20:13.211
I was missing something.

20:13.277 --> 20:16.346
Love is what
makes life worth living.

20:16.413 --> 20:20.084
So, Joker went through
some changes over
the last few months.

20:20.151 --> 20:23.019
I don't wanna blow
what could be a great thing.

20:23.086 --> 20:24.923
Like a friend of mine did.

20:24.923 --> 20:27.224
I still have the remote
to blow up your fuckin' head.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.493
I wanna give this a shot.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.863
[speaking in Spanish]

20:31.930 --> 20:34.065
[gasps] Oh, baby!

20:34.131 --> 20:35.132
We need that book.

20:35.199 --> 20:37.714
Jesus! Read the fucking room!

20:42.740 --> 20:46.790
[suspenseful music playing]

20:49.480 --> 20:50.480
[both gasp]

20:50.548 --> 20:52.416
[weakly] Thank Hera!

20:52.482 --> 20:54.050
That place was hell.

20:54.117 --> 20:56.520
[softly] They made us listen
to the same songs

20:56.587 --> 20:59.758
[breath shudders]
over and over again.

20:59.824 --> 21:02.226
[trembling] Too soft.
Too hard. Never just right.

21:02.292 --> 21:04.028
Never just right.

21:04.896 --> 21:05.896
So, in summary,

21:05.896 --> 21:07.531
we have to take down
the parademon army

21:07.598 --> 21:08.866
and get to Dr. Psycho.

21:08.933 --> 21:10.468
No time to waste!

21:10.535 --> 21:13.403
[grunting and groaning]
Sorry! It's been a minute.

21:13.471 --> 21:15.973
I should probably
get back to Central City.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.240
[groans]

21:21.546 --> 21:23.381
I'll go make some coffee.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.548
So, is this your new life?

21:24.548 --> 21:25.750
You're gonna go coach
a little league team

21:25.750 --> 21:27.285
and get ice cream
after the game?

21:27.351 --> 21:28.819
[chuckles] No!

21:28.886 --> 21:31.455
Little Benicio's
lactose-intolerant.

21:31.521 --> 21:34.392
Look, lots of dads
are serial killers.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.326
I'm not gonna change who I am.

21:36.394 --> 21:38.462
I just have
a better reason to kill.

21:38.528 --> 21:41.066
I am in love!
[laughing]

21:41.133 --> 21:42.768
Now, it's your turn.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.803
I told you, I tried.
It didn't work.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.703
Ivy said no.

21:45.703 --> 21:47.704
Are you prepared
to live with that?

21:47.771 --> 21:49.874
I'm prepared for anything.

21:51.742 --> 21:54.377
Ivy! What're you doing here?

21:54.444 --> 21:57.048
I've got something to tell you.

21:57.115 --> 21:58.682
I am going to kill you.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.585
[dramatic music playing]

22:00.652 --> 22:02.319
-Damn! That shit was tense.
-[groans]

22:02.385 --> 22:03.721
See, now, this show is a comedy

22:03.788 --> 22:06.289
that combines both humor
and dramatic tension.

22:06.356 --> 22:07.992
-Can I get a Chiron?
-[buzzer sounds]

22:08.058 --> 22:09.292
See you all next week.

22:09.359 --> 22:10.627
Same Frank time,

22:10.694 --> 22:11.997
same Frank channel.

22:12.063 --> 22:14.365
I'm gonna get some popcorn
in anticipation.

22:14.432 --> 22:16.232
Hey, Chaz.
Hook a brother up!

22:16.299 --> 22:18.234
-[laughs]
-[slurping]

22:18.301 --> 22:19.703
[spits] There's butter on this!

22:19.770 --> 22:21.105
[shouting] What the fuck, Chaz?

22:21.173 --> 22:22.606
I'm watchin' my cholesterol.

22:23.540 --> 22:25.777
[theme music playing]
