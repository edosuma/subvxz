¶

01:24.083 --> 01:25.416
I don't know, Alex.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.952
I think I should be doing
something better with my life.

01:27.986 --> 01:30.021
You know, I've been thinking
about going to college.

01:30.055 --> 01:31.556
Really?

01:31.591 --> 01:33.925
Hey, that's great, Tony, I'm
glad to hear you talk like that.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.860
I only wish I knew
      how to go about it.

01:35.928 --> 01:37.896
Well, you find a college,
    you get an application,

01:37.930 --> 01:39.264
you make it out and send it in.

01:39.298 --> 01:40.932
Yeah, boy,

01:40.967 --> 01:43.901
nothing worthwhile
            comes easy, does it?

01:45.638 --> 01:47.238
Come on, let's get out of here,
        let's settle up.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.339
What does this
come to?
                Well, let's see,

01:48.373 --> 01:50.274
we had two pitchers of
         beer at 3.65 a pitcher.

01:50.309 --> 01:51.409
Uh-huh.

01:52.344 --> 01:54.279
Oh.

01:54.313 --> 01:55.614
Uh...

01:55.648 --> 01:57.516
3.65, three-sixty...

01:57.550 --> 01:58.683
Thank you.

01:58.718 --> 02:01.452
Uh...

02:01.454 --> 02:03.754
three-sixty-five

02:03.756 --> 02:06.257
times two,

02:06.291 --> 02:07.893
carry the seven.

02:07.927 --> 02:09.860
Um, they don't ask
       this kind of stuff

02:09.895 --> 02:11.963
on college applications,
            do they?

02:13.265 --> 02:15.000
Tony,

02:15.034 --> 02:17.969
you're making this
              far too difficult.

02:18.003 --> 02:21.006
There's a simple
                    and easy way

02:21.040 --> 02:23.008
to figure this out.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.010
Tommy?

02:25.044 --> 02:26.344
What do we owe you?

02:26.412 --> 02:28.112
Seven dollars and thirty cents.

02:29.148 --> 02:31.516
Sure, you went
to college.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.385
Thanks.
                      Hey, guys.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.520
Hey, Elaine.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.355
Well, I finally
                         did it.

02:37.389 --> 02:39.357
I made an appointment
      with my psychiatrist

02:39.391 --> 02:41.292
for this afternoon
           for Latka.

02:41.326 --> 02:43.461
Psychiatrist?
            Mm-hmm.

02:43.495 --> 02:45.630
You don't think it's really
     that serious, do you?

02:45.664 --> 02:46.664
Serious?

02:46.699 --> 02:49.467
Come on, the man changes
    personalities every day.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.403
I know, but he's
             harmless, isn't he?

02:51.437 --> 02:52.537
Yeah, besides,

02:52.571 --> 02:54.406
one of his personalities
is a friend of mine.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.374
And another one
owes me 50 bucks.

02:56.408 --> 02:57.742
(phone ringing)

02:57.777 --> 03:00.044
Guys, I think Latka should see
         Dr. Jeffries.

03:00.078 --> 03:02.047
Come on, no one can help him
            but us.

03:02.081 --> 03:04.749
What time are we leaving?

03:04.783 --> 03:06.317
Elaine, it's a phone call
            for you.

03:06.351 --> 03:07.852
It's your babysitter.

03:07.887 --> 03:08.787
Oh, okay.
                          TOMMY:
            Take it in the back.

03:08.821 --> 03:11.556
Wait, what...?
   As soon as I finish this.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.825
Come on, Alex, maybe this guy
        can help Latka.

03:13.859 --> 03:14.759
Aw.
Come on,

03:14.794 --> 03:16.361
don't you believe
in psychiatrists?

03:16.395 --> 03:18.830
Tony, I really don't have any
  opinion about psychiatrists,

03:18.864 --> 03:20.332
because I've never been to one.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.801
I've never really felt
      I had to go to one.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.670
I believe you can get through
 life by common sense, coping,

03:25.705 --> 03:28.540
and taking 30 showers a day.

03:28.574 --> 03:30.107
Oh, you know something?

03:30.142 --> 03:31.609
Those children of mine
   are gonna kill each other

03:31.643 --> 03:33.177
one of these days.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.481
Jason put Jennifer's Pokey doll
       in the microwave.

03:36.515 --> 03:38.116
Oh.

03:38.150 --> 03:39.783
Oh.
       And she found it.

03:39.818 --> 03:42.953
Now she's got to live
      with that nightmare.

03:42.988 --> 03:45.723
Elaine, I don't want to
              seem unsympathetic
               to your problems,

03:45.757 --> 03:47.826
but don't we have to get
              to an appointment?

03:47.860 --> 03:49.594
Oh, oh, Alex,
about that, uh,

03:49.628 --> 03:52.430
I promised Jennifer
I'd go home.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.599
Hmm?
Pokey's funeral is
this afternoon.

03:54.633 --> 03:55.900
Elaine!

03:55.935 --> 03:57.835
You're kidding-- you're
             indulging that kid!

03:57.869 --> 03:59.003
Pokey is a...

03:59.071 --> 04:00.771
Was Alex, was.

04:00.806 --> 04:01.706
Forgive me.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.009
Pokey was a rubber toy.

04:04.043 --> 04:07.912
With feelings and emotions
like any other rubber toy.

04:07.946 --> 04:10.415
What am I saying?

04:10.449 --> 04:11.783
Look, why don't I

04:11.817 --> 04:13.151
just give you
    Dr. Jeffries's address,

04:13.185 --> 04:14.352
and then you can...
                    No, no wait,
                         Elaine,

04:14.386 --> 04:16.021
I just promised...
Come on, Alex, come on, do this.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.488
Do this favor and I'll owe you
          a big favor.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.058
I'll see you.
           Bye, Tony.
                     Oh...

04:20.091 --> 04:23.027
now I'm stuck with this thing.

04:23.062 --> 04:26.364
I have to take Latka
       to a psychiatrist.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.000
So he hasn't been
             acting like himself
              lately-- big deal.

04:29.034 --> 04:30.835
Big deal.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.536
All right, I'll
                       take him.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.339
I'm telling you Tony, Elaine is
 making much too much of this.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.710
Are you finished, Arlo?

04:39.745 --> 04:41.746
Finished?

04:41.781 --> 04:43.748
Uh, partner, I'm
                     as finished

04:43.783 --> 04:45.249
as a white suit
                      on a sissy

04:45.284 --> 04:47.218
who's been wrestling a
         half-breed in pig slop.

04:51.156 --> 04:54.125
On the other hand, Elaine
    may have a point there.

04:54.159 --> 04:56.093
¶

05:10.275 --> 05:12.309
Congratulate me.

05:12.345 --> 05:15.246
This is my last
cigarette.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.918
Is, uh, toward you
masculine

05:19.952 --> 05:21.920
and away from me
feminine?

05:21.954 --> 05:23.754
I can never remember.

05:23.789 --> 05:25.723
Mmm.

05:28.794 --> 05:31.262
Would you like to know
how I quit?

05:31.297 --> 05:33.198
Why?

05:33.232 --> 05:34.299
(stammering)

05:34.333 --> 05:36.067
I just said to myself,

05:36.102 --> 05:38.069
I'm gonna do it all today.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.837
You know, the first day

05:39.872 --> 05:42.907
of the rest of your life
kind of thing.

05:42.942 --> 05:46.010
From now on,
it's no more cigarettes,

05:46.045 --> 05:49.080
no more promiscuity.

05:49.115 --> 05:52.751
No more Doris Marie Winslow
giving her phone number

05:52.785 --> 05:56.121
when it's listed
anyway.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.964
You know
I don't miss it.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.934
I thought this was
gonna be tough.

06:11.169 --> 06:13.438
My taste buds are returning.

06:13.472 --> 06:15.206
I admire your
                      willpower.

06:17.976 --> 06:19.611
Hello?

06:19.645 --> 06:21.312
Where am I?

06:21.346 --> 06:24.315
What-- why am I dressed
like the poop-kicker?

06:26.719 --> 06:28.653
Latka, is that you?

06:28.687 --> 06:30.421
Of course it is.

06:30.423 --> 06:32.157
Dr. Jeffries will be ready
      for you in a minute.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.558
Thank you.
Dr. Jeffries?

06:33.592 --> 06:34.759
Is somebody sick?

06:34.793 --> 06:35.927
He's a psychiatrist.

06:35.961 --> 06:37.629
Uh, remember, we made
                 an appointment?

06:37.663 --> 06:39.830
Oh, why do I need
a psychiatrist?

06:39.864 --> 06:41.499
Well, for, uh,
                    for openers,

06:41.533 --> 06:43.501
there's this split
              personality thing.

06:43.535 --> 06:46.036
Oh, no, no, that was
just a joke.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.672
Joke?
Joke, yeah,
take a joke.

06:47.706 --> 06:48.940
You mean you were
                   just kidding?

06:48.974 --> 06:50.508
Yeah, just telling
a joke.
                     Oh, really?

06:50.542 --> 06:52.544
Yeah.
                         Uh-huh.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.346
You mean, you Latka, were just
          pretending to be Arlo?

06:55.414 --> 06:57.148
Only pretend, yes.
                     Oh, really.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.549
Why don't you
                   just show me?

06:58.584 --> 06:59.784
Show you?
                 Yeah, prove it,
                         please.

06:59.818 --> 07:01.052
Prove it?
                           Yeah.

07:01.086 --> 07:02.720
Okay.
                       Go ahead,
                      right now.

07:02.754 --> 07:04.689
Prove it to you?
Yeah.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.636
All right, buckaroo.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.709
There is not room enough
in this town

07:24.743 --> 07:28.713
for the-the-the...
the both of us.

07:28.747 --> 07:30.715
There is no room.

07:30.749 --> 07:32.049
(grunting)

07:32.117 --> 07:33.918
Wait, wait a minute,
         wait a minute.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.921
This gets better.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.391
We both-both going to have to go
       to the other town.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.960
No, Latka, no.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.128
No good?
                           No.

07:44.162 --> 07:45.329
Come on, Latka.

07:45.363 --> 07:47.164
All right.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.733
Dr. Jeffries will see you now.

07:48.767 --> 07:49.867
Thank you.
   Oh, no,

07:49.902 --> 07:51.002
he will see my dust.

07:51.036 --> 07:53.338
No, no, no, no, wait,
               wait, wait, wait!

07:53.405 --> 07:56.774
Look, Elaine thinks this is
     important, and maybe it is.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.110
Latka, there's nothing
                to be afraid of.

07:59.144 --> 08:00.845
I mean, you-you have
                  a stomachache,

08:00.879 --> 08:02.413
you go to a doctor,
                          right?
  Yeah.

08:02.447 --> 08:04.415
You have a toothache,
            you go to a dentist.

08:04.449 --> 08:06.918
You have primary and
        secondary ego diffusion,

08:06.952 --> 08:08.753
you go to a psychiatrist.

08:08.787 --> 08:10.554
Look, Latka, you're here
                right now, okay?

08:10.589 --> 08:11.889
Just-just talk
                     to the man.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.224
All right.

08:13.258 --> 08:15.093
You know, I'm glad
you are my friend, Alex.

08:15.127 --> 08:16.661
I'm glad you are here
with me.
                         Latka,

08:16.695 --> 08:18.228
there's nothing I
            wouldn't do for you.

08:18.263 --> 08:19.363
Oh, good!

08:19.431 --> 08:20.731
Then I'm going
to need someone

08:20.766 --> 08:22.700
to cut these pants off.

08:26.271 --> 08:29.206
(sobbing)

08:35.514 --> 08:41.152
And I-I have never felt
    so emotional in my life.

08:41.186 --> 08:46.291
I cry and I cry
 every time I think about them.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.059
Latka, I think we were all moved

08:48.093 --> 08:52.030
when Prince Charles
        kissed Lady Di,

08:52.064 --> 08:55.232
but, uh, perhaps we ought to,
           you know,

08:55.267 --> 08:57.501
take this time
       to talk about you.

08:57.536 --> 08:59.971
Oh no, go on,

09:00.005 --> 09:01.606
I don't want to seem
          like a bore.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.240
No, no, no, no.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.843
No, I'd-I'd just--
                        I'd be--

09:05.877 --> 09:07.512
I'd be fascinated.

09:07.546 --> 09:08.646
Why don't you tell me

09:08.680 --> 09:11.349
what it was like growing
             up in your country?

09:11.383 --> 09:13.184
Well, it was--

09:13.218 --> 09:15.186
it was a full childhood.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.188
We had-- we had the wood,

09:17.222 --> 09:20.157
we had the bucket,
       we had the chair.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.394
Then when I was eight,
     my father got a raise,

09:24.429 --> 09:26.964
so we moved someplace indoors.

09:29.668 --> 09:33.270
Boy, I'm glad I got that
         off my chest.

09:33.304 --> 09:35.339
You're good.

09:39.344 --> 09:41.645
Were you happy
                     as a child?

09:41.680 --> 09:43.213
What's not to be happy?

09:43.282 --> 09:45.883
We had the wood, we had the
   bucket, we had the chair,

09:45.917 --> 09:47.651
and we had the mother
       who forced me to--

09:47.685 --> 09:49.319
oh, hello!

09:49.354 --> 09:51.222
This might be something.

09:51.256 --> 09:53.423
Yes, Latka, yes, go on.

09:53.459 --> 09:55.226
Oh, no, no, it is nothing.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.593
This is okay, Latka.

09:56.628 --> 09:59.097
If you don't feel like talking,
       you don't have to.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.799
But the more you talk,
        the more I can help you.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.634
(as Vic Ferrari):
     Okay, what do you want
         to talk about?

10:03.669 --> 10:05.736
I love talking to shrinks.

10:09.074 --> 10:12.110
Uh, we-we haven't met, have we?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.044
Vic, Vic Ferrari.

10:20.085 --> 10:21.986
Whoa!

10:22.021 --> 10:24.755
Somebody blew a bundle
at the Dodge City Sears.

10:24.789 --> 10:26.723
(laughs)

10:28.260 --> 10:29.994
Vic, uh...

10:30.028 --> 10:33.865
I'm-I'm Dr. Jeffries,
           Latka's psychiatrist.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.132
Oh, really, eh?

10:35.167 --> 10:38.069
What is this, the "I'm okay,
      you're okay" corral?

10:39.905 --> 10:41.939
Book this boy on Merv.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.943
Vic, it was great seeing you.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.280
But, uh, now I'd like
       to talk to Latka.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.615
Oh, Latka Gravas?
                            Yes.

10:50.649 --> 10:53.283
Hey, he's a cute little guy,
but between you and me, Doc, uh,

10:53.318 --> 10:56.286
he's all oatmeal north of the
eyebrows, you know what I mean?

10:56.321 --> 10:59.289
But, uh, if you want him,
          you got him.

10:59.324 --> 11:01.859
(as Latka):
  Why are you writing so fast?

11:01.894 --> 11:04.629
Huh?

11:04.663 --> 11:05.963
Uh, Latka?

11:05.997 --> 11:07.598
Yes?
        I just met Vic.

11:07.632 --> 11:09.033
Oh, yeah?

11:09.067 --> 11:11.969
Well, I have some messages
            for him.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.308
Latka, uh, you had the wood,

11:17.342 --> 11:19.810
you had the bucket,
       you had the chair,

11:19.844 --> 11:23.047
and you had the mother who--
           who what?

11:23.081 --> 11:24.916
Latka, I think you
                want to tell me.

11:24.950 --> 11:27.584
Well...

11:27.619 --> 11:30.721
she forced me to spend the
  summers with my Uncle Bobka.

11:33.392 --> 11:35.126
Listen, would--

11:35.160 --> 11:38.729
is it possible for me to speak
       with Uncle Bobka?

11:38.764 --> 11:41.632
Well, you can try,
   but you have to talk loud.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.600
You see, they buried him
         12 years ago.

11:46.004 --> 11:47.838
Well, uh, could you tell me

11:47.873 --> 11:51.141
what, uh, uh,
     Uncle Bobka was like?

11:51.176 --> 11:53.377
Oh sure, I can do that.

11:53.411 --> 11:54.645
I show you.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.813
(clears throat)

11:55.847 --> 11:57.849
He would say to me,

11:57.883 --> 12:00.517
(in deep voice):
"Don't be such
a crybaby, Latka.

12:00.552 --> 12:03.588
"I will make a man
of you.

12:03.622 --> 12:04.555
"Come with me.

12:04.589 --> 12:07.391
I will put hair on your yanick."

12:07.425 --> 12:10.795
Then he would take me
down to the river

12:10.829 --> 12:12.797
and pretend
to throw me in.

12:12.831 --> 12:15.633
(as young Latka):
"But I don't know how to swim,
Uncle Bobka."

12:15.667 --> 12:17.101
(in deep voice):
"Oh, come on,

12:17.135 --> 12:20.070
everybody knows how to swim
if they have to."

12:20.105 --> 12:22.506
Then, he would
     throw me up in the air

12:22.540 --> 12:25.575
and catch me at the last minute.

12:25.610 --> 12:29.146
You see, he had no children
     of his own to destroy.

12:30.882 --> 12:32.749
Every night
I would lie in bed

12:32.751 --> 12:36.854
awake and I would wish
     I was never been born.

12:36.888 --> 12:38.022
Yeah,

12:38.056 --> 12:39.924
what a terrible time
       you must have had.

12:39.958 --> 12:41.592
Well, not so bad.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.363
Some children never
    get to see their uncles.

12:45.397 --> 12:47.331
Latka, this, you know,

12:47.366 --> 12:49.599
this has been
     a remarkable session.

12:49.601 --> 12:52.203
Thank you very much.

12:52.237 --> 12:55.639
But, uh, now, I'd, uh,

12:55.674 --> 12:58.308
I'd like to see
      Alex Reiger, please.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.077
Okay.

13:00.112 --> 13:04.681
Could you send, uh,
    Alex Reiger in, please?

13:04.716 --> 13:05.950
(as ALEX):
Hi, Doc, Alex Reiger.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.551
Pleased to meet you.

13:09.487 --> 13:10.554
Excuse me.

13:10.588 --> 13:12.323
You're, you're Alex Reiger?

13:12.325 --> 13:14.591
That's right,
I'm a cab driver
and I don't mind.

13:16.161 --> 13:21.031
Well, Alex, uh,
                you know it's...

13:23.735 --> 13:25.435
...good meeting you.

13:25.470 --> 13:28.105
But I was just talking
               to Latka and I'd,

13:28.139 --> 13:29.907
I'd really like
               to see him again.

13:29.941 --> 13:32.310
Well, uh, I'd like
        to oblige, Doc,

13:32.344 --> 13:33.678
but I'm afraid
       that's impossible.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.279
You see, Latka's gone.

13:35.313 --> 13:36.313
He's gone?

13:36.348 --> 13:38.649
I see. Oh...

13:38.683 --> 13:41.618
Could I see Vic?

13:41.653 --> 13:43.454
Arlo?

13:43.488 --> 13:45.890
Anybody?

13:48.159 --> 13:50.661
Doctor Jeffries?
              Yes, yes, come in.

13:50.696 --> 13:53.331
Uh, could you excuse us
                       a minute?

13:53.365 --> 13:55.265
I, uh...

14:01.072 --> 14:02.807
I, uh...

14:02.841 --> 14:05.076
I'd like to have a word
         alone with your friend.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.577
Sure, Doc.
    I'll be waiting outside.

14:09.247 --> 14:10.714
Excuse me.

14:10.748 --> 14:12.549
Certainly.

14:18.556 --> 14:21.359
Doctor, excuse me.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.194
Who does he remind me of?

14:23.228 --> 14:25.362
Sit down.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.497
Uh, first of all, Mr. Reiger.

14:27.532 --> 14:29.366
Who was that guy?

14:29.400 --> 14:31.936
I just want to set your
              mind at ease that,

14:32.037 --> 14:35.139
uh, Latka, Mr. Gravas,
        is in no danger.

14:35.173 --> 14:36.340
It wasn't Arlo.

14:36.374 --> 14:37.741
It wasn't Vic.
                      And, uh...

14:37.775 --> 14:38.875
Who was he?

14:38.877 --> 14:40.277
Yeah, he'll, he'll be okay.

14:40.345 --> 14:42.179
Just as long as he has
        all his friends

14:42.214 --> 14:43.647
around him to give him support,

14:43.682 --> 14:44.781
as long as he--
             Fine.

14:44.816 --> 14:45.983
But who is he?

14:46.017 --> 14:49.719
Alex... he's you.

15:00.832 --> 15:02.466
Hi, Alex.
Hi, Tony.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.668
Alex, I'm worried.

15:04.702 --> 15:08.339
I got to take my college
    aptitude test next week.

15:08.373 --> 15:11.676
In my high school, they
  didn't even teach aptitude.

15:11.710 --> 15:15.378
Well, Tony, not everybody
     should go to college.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.748
That's what it said under
  my picture in the yearbook.

15:20.418 --> 15:21.885
It's so tough.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.286
You know, when
       I was in the ring,

15:23.321 --> 15:24.788
I knew that's
      what I wanted to be.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.024
Now, I don't know what I'm
   going to do with my life.

15:27.058 --> 15:28.725
Wait a minute, Tony.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.262
If you miss boxing so much,

15:31.296 --> 15:33.063
have you ever
considered being a ref?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.564
...eree?

15:36.200 --> 15:38.369
Yeah, you remember
                    the referee.

15:38.403 --> 15:39.937
He was the one in the ring

15:39.971 --> 15:42.707
who <i>wasn't</i>
     beating you senseless.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.875
(laughing)

15:44.909 --> 15:46.343
A ref, huh, Alex?
Yeah.

15:46.377 --> 15:48.412
You know, I like that idea.

15:48.446 --> 15:49.346
I'm gonna think about that.

15:49.381 --> 15:50.380
Thank you.

15:50.414 --> 15:52.316
A ref...

15:54.252 --> 15:56.620
(AS ALEX):
       Here you go, Lou.
              Ooh.

15:56.688 --> 15:58.589
Ooh!

15:58.623 --> 16:00.757
Another lollapaloosa night

16:00.792 --> 16:04.428
for Reiger number two!

16:04.463 --> 16:07.864
I kiss the day you went
off your nut, Alex.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.401
Hey, Lou, uh, what do you
        think of the human race?

16:11.436 --> 16:12.936
I'd like an outsider's opinion.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.544
Funnier than you.

16:22.647 --> 16:24.781
A buck and a half
for your thoughts.

16:26.551 --> 16:28.018
Inflation.

16:28.052 --> 16:29.220
Ah, it's nothing.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.921
I had a little problem,
            I got it all solved.

16:30.955 --> 16:32.423
I'm going to be a referee.

16:32.457 --> 16:33.991
Sure you want to be a referee?

16:34.025 --> 16:35.392
I don't know, I mean,

16:35.427 --> 16:38.128
the money ain't that great
             and fans hate them.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.464
Oh, why do you want
to be a referee?

16:40.498 --> 16:41.498
I don't know.

16:41.532 --> 16:43.600
Somebody thought it
                was a good idea.

16:43.634 --> 16:45.669
Sounds like terrible
advice to me.

16:45.703 --> 16:47.437
Me, too.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.609
A referee?

16:52.643 --> 16:55.179
I thought it was a good idea.

16:55.213 --> 16:56.480
Oh, hey, Alex?

16:56.514 --> 16:57.581
Yeah?

16:57.615 --> 17:00.451
Uh, no, no, no,
   not you, Alex, this Alex.

17:00.485 --> 17:02.286
Oh, right.
Oh, but that reminds me.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.420
Alex?
Yeah?

17:03.454 --> 17:04.688
Uh, no, no, no,
         not you, Alex,

17:04.722 --> 17:06.490
this Alex.
           Oh, right.

17:06.523 --> 17:08.992
That advice you gave me
worked out beautifully.

17:09.026 --> 17:11.328
I kept Jason and Jennifer
apart until they begged me

17:11.362 --> 17:12.963
to let them play
with each other again.

17:12.997 --> 17:14.964
Well, I'm just glad
         it worked out.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.433
Thanks.

17:16.468 --> 17:18.801
They're making you a card
     for your refrigerator.

17:20.271 --> 17:22.373
Now, Alex, guess what?

17:22.406 --> 17:24.974
I have two tickets to see
             Lena Horne tonight.

17:25.009 --> 17:26.143
You want to go?

17:26.176 --> 17:27.410
Uh, oh, no, I'm sorry Elaine,

17:27.444 --> 17:29.279
I, uh, I'm going to
the hockey game tonight.

17:29.313 --> 17:30.581
Sorry, I can't make it.

17:30.615 --> 17:31.882
Oh, that's okay.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.284
I-I can find somebody else.

17:36.387 --> 17:38.455
Um...

17:38.489 --> 17:40.423
I have two tickets
    for Lena Horne tonight.

17:40.458 --> 17:41.992
Would you like to go?

17:42.026 --> 17:43.060
Sure, great.

17:43.094 --> 17:44.461
I got tickets to
                the hockey game,

17:44.495 --> 17:46.663
but I'll just give
               them to some kid.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.538
I should have done that.

17:54.572 --> 17:56.806
Okay, Alex, then it's a date.

17:56.841 --> 17:59.309
Uh, take your ticket 'cause I
have to meet you there, okay?

17:59.343 --> 18:00.644
All right.
     Okay.

18:00.678 --> 18:02.279
Thank you.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.482
Elaine, Elaine!

18:05.516 --> 18:07.685
You just made a
                date with Latka!

18:07.719 --> 18:10.821
Uh, yeah, I guess I did, huh?

18:10.855 --> 18:12.956
I don't believe this!

18:12.991 --> 18:15.225
I don't believe that
you're not more concerned.

18:15.259 --> 18:17.360
You were the one that
got him to go to see

18:17.395 --> 18:19.029
a psychiatrist because
you were so upset.

18:19.063 --> 18:21.298
Yeah, I know, I, I did.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.867
You know, it's kind of strange,

18:22.901 --> 18:26.337
but, now that he's you,
          somehow it seems okay.

18:26.371 --> 18:27.804
Wait a minute!

18:27.838 --> 18:31.375
Are you making a case
 for multiple personality now?

18:31.409 --> 18:33.544
You know, you're getting
   awfully emotional about this.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.045
You're damn right I am!

18:35.147 --> 18:36.880
How would you like someone
living your life?

18:36.914 --> 18:38.449
And having more fun at it?

18:40.485 --> 18:42.119
I mean, I might
      not have been much,

18:42.153 --> 18:45.122
but at least I was
     the only one being me.

18:45.156 --> 18:47.024
How come he's smarter than I am?

18:47.058 --> 18:49.692
How come he's booking
     more money than I am?

18:49.727 --> 18:51.261
How come he's, uh...

18:51.295 --> 18:51.995
More fun.

18:52.029 --> 18:53.530
Thank you. More fun.

18:53.564 --> 18:56.700
Maybe I should be the
one giving up being me!

18:56.734 --> 18:58.102
You seem upset about
                something, Alex.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.771
Yes, I am!

19:00.805 --> 19:02.206
You know, I'm on my way
    to see Dr. Jeffries now

19:02.240 --> 19:03.540
and he's helped me a lot.

19:03.574 --> 19:04.774
Maybe he'll help you, too.
Oh?

19:04.809 --> 19:06.310
Would you like to come
        and talk to him?

19:06.344 --> 19:07.144
Would I like to come...

19:07.178 --> 19:08.579
(stammering):
Yes, right now.

19:08.613 --> 19:10.480
Hi, Alex.

19:10.514 --> 19:12.549
Hi, Jim.
    Hi, Jim.

19:15.987 --> 19:17.388
Where are they going?

19:17.422 --> 19:19.189
To see their psychiatrist.

19:19.223 --> 19:23.593
Boy, what do you think
         the odds are

19:23.627 --> 19:26.129
of two guys
     having the same name,

19:26.164 --> 19:27.797
in the same garage,

19:27.832 --> 19:30.067
going to see
     the same psychiatrist

19:30.101 --> 19:32.569
at the same time?

19:32.603 --> 19:35.406
Gotta be three to one.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.546
Dr. Jeffries,

19:42.580 --> 19:44.381
you've been seeing
Latka for a month now

19:44.415 --> 19:45.849
and I'm getting worried
about his health.

19:45.883 --> 19:47.217
Oh, I don't think there's

19:47.251 --> 19:48.785
any need to worry
      about his condition.

19:48.819 --> 19:49.786
Well, I do.

19:49.820 --> 19:51.021
I'm going to strangle that guy.

19:51.055 --> 19:52.656
Now, how long is this
         going to last?

19:52.690 --> 19:54.290
Well, from what I know about it,

19:54.325 --> 19:56.793
I'm surprised
    it's gone on this long.

19:56.828 --> 20:00.363
But this is a fascinating case.

20:00.397 --> 20:04.067
(chuckling):
        I'm a lucky guy.

20:06.070 --> 20:08.005
Hey,

20:08.039 --> 20:10.207
maybe you can help.

20:10.275 --> 20:10.941
Hmm?
                            Yes.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.376
Would you mind,

20:12.410 --> 20:14.944
would you mind staying
      through his session?

20:18.416 --> 20:19.483
All right.

20:23.921 --> 20:25.155
Uh, Mr. Reiger?

20:25.190 --> 20:27.791
Would you step in now please?

20:31.429 --> 20:34.097
Would you mind sharing
this session with him?

20:34.132 --> 20:36.300
Not at all.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.537
Don't hog the therapy.

20:41.806 --> 20:45.275
Well, Alex, what's it
            been like this week?

20:45.309 --> 20:46.643
Well, Doc,

20:46.678 --> 20:49.045
I've been thinking
            about my life a lot.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.182
Where does Alex Reiger
                   go from here?

20:52.217 --> 20:54.784
I mean, uh, I don't
                    want to crab

20:54.819 --> 20:57.054
uh, we're here,
                 we take a shot.

20:57.088 --> 20:59.289
But when you
examine my life,

20:59.323 --> 21:02.493
I had a bad marriage, my
        wife was cheating on me.

21:02.527 --> 21:03.660
Which was probably my fault,

21:03.694 --> 21:05.395
I mean, I should have
              caught her sooner.

21:07.331 --> 21:09.166
My daughter's grown, and, uh,

21:09.200 --> 21:11.101
we're not as close as I'd like.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.503
She does seem grateful,

21:12.537 --> 21:14.504
but, uh, I think
                that's primarily

21:14.538 --> 21:16.773
for not inheriting my nose.

21:16.807 --> 21:18.575
Are you self-conscious
        about your nose?

21:18.609 --> 21:20.610
No!
                Well, I sure am!

21:20.645 --> 21:22.412
I got a honker here
                that won't quit!

21:22.446 --> 21:24.514
I mean, who are we kidding?

21:24.548 --> 21:26.750
But forget about how
 I screwed up things right now.

21:26.784 --> 21:28.485
I was thinking just
                the other night,

21:28.520 --> 21:30.820
I got a mediocre job
           which I do very well.

21:30.855 --> 21:32.156
Yeah.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.091
But it doesn't stimulate me.
  That's right.

21:34.125 --> 21:37.093
I like my friends, but the
   nature of the relationship

21:37.127 --> 21:39.228
seems to be that I'm some
   kind of authority figure.

21:39.263 --> 21:40.431
Right.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.098
I listen to their problems

21:42.133 --> 21:43.534
and I'm not supposed
                    to have any!

21:43.568 --> 21:44.768
Yeah!

21:44.803 --> 21:48.639
I take pride in accepting
        things the way they are,

21:48.673 --> 21:51.007
but I just realized that
       maybe that's because, uh,

21:51.042 --> 21:53.276
it's an excuse for not
            having any ambition.

21:53.311 --> 21:55.579
(whistles)

21:55.613 --> 21:56.947
I'm starting to realize

21:56.981 --> 21:58.815
that my love for life
                  is unrequited.

21:58.849 --> 22:02.119
Oh, God, yes.

22:02.153 --> 22:04.888
Oh, he's pouring out
         my heart here.

22:06.691 --> 22:08.658
So, I was really down

22:08.692 --> 22:10.727
till suddenly it came to me.

22:10.761 --> 22:13.896
The exact thing
        that I should do

22:13.931 --> 22:16.099
to put my whole life in order!

22:16.133 --> 22:17.301
What's that?

22:17.335 --> 22:19.136
And I feel like
                a million bucks!

22:19.170 --> 22:20.537
What?

22:20.571 --> 22:22.139
And you know what it is?

22:22.173 --> 22:22.973
What?

22:23.007 --> 22:25.776
It's so damn simple!

22:25.810 --> 22:26.944
What, what, what, what, what?

22:26.978 --> 22:30.113
The answer to it all is...

22:30.147 --> 22:31.749
What?!
          What, what?!

22:31.783 --> 22:34.451
(as LATKA):
     So, we had the bucket,
       we had the wood...

22:34.485 --> 22:37.020
No, no, no, no!

22:37.055 --> 22:38.188
No, no, no!

22:38.222 --> 22:40.657
What was it? What?!

22:40.691 --> 22:43.127
(babbling)
                           No!

22:43.161 --> 22:44.361
Mr. Reiger.
         He almost had it,

22:44.395 --> 22:45.795
you heard him,
       he almost had it!

22:45.830 --> 22:47.064
What? What's simple?

22:47.098 --> 22:48.665
Alex, you're squeezing me.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.034
Huh? Oh.

22:51.068 --> 22:53.403
Thank you very much.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.807
What is this?

22:57.775 --> 22:59.876
Ooh, could I please go now?

22:59.911 --> 23:02.478
I think I have a good
seat to see Lena Horne.

23:02.513 --> 23:03.980
Yeah.

23:04.015 --> 23:07.184
I think we've accomplished
       a lot in one day.

23:07.218 --> 23:10.253
Yeah, must've been placed
here by a "put-pocket."

23:13.991 --> 23:16.126
Bye-bye.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.997
Thanks, Alex.

23:20.031 --> 23:21.398
Good seeing you again.

23:21.432 --> 23:23.200
Huh? Oh, yeah.

23:23.234 --> 23:24.634
It was good seeing you, too.

23:28.472 --> 23:32.976
Doctor, since there is time
     left in the session...

23:33.010 --> 23:35.645
Have a seat.

23:36.681 --> 23:38.915
(as LATKA):
      Thank you very much.

24:15.653 --> 24:17.354
WOMAN:
                     Good night,
                    Mr. Walters!
