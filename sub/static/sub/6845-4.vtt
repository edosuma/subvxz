- Oh, really?
- Yep.

17:00.424 --> 17:02.090
- Who put that in there?
- I did!

17:02.126 --> 17:03.859
I said I'm sorry. What else do you want?

17:03.894 --> 17:05.093
It's just careless

17:05.128 --> 17:06.828
to go around saying things like that.

17:06.864 --> 17:08.964
This is how rumors get started.

17:08.999 --> 17:11.133
I was just saying you
were being a little flirty.

17:11.167 --> 17:13.068
I didn't say you were
banging in the break room.

17:13.103 --> 17:15.037
Come on! Help me out here.

17:15.071 --> 17:16.071
Whoa!

17:16.073 --> 17:18.973
Oh, hey, guys.

17:19.009 --> 17:20.776
Now,<i> that</i> is how rumors get started.

17:20.817 --> 17:21.915
♪

17:23.339 --> 17:24.638
This is not how it looks.

17:24.641 --> 17:25.707
Really?

17:25.709 --> 17:27.175
'Cause it looks like you got a sex doll

17:27.176 --> 17:28.710
and you dressing it up to look like Amy.

17:28.712 --> 17:29.712
- Yeah.
- No.

17:29.713 --> 17:30.845
See, that sounds stalker-y,

17:30.847 --> 17:32.447
whereas I specifically bought this doll

17:32.449 --> 17:34.282
because it already looked like Amy.

17:34.284 --> 17:35.417
I'm walking away.

17:35.419 --> 17:37.318
Oh, good. More people.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.287
- Oh, my god!
- Is that supposed to be Amy?

17:39.289 --> 17:41.256
- No.
- Yes, yes.

17:41.258 --> 17:42.323
I wanted to get back at Amy,

17:42.325 --> 17:43.892
and there are no mannequins in the store

17:43.894 --> 17:44.993
that look remotely like her.

17:44.995 --> 17:46.661
Which, can we talk about that for a second?

17:46.663 --> 17:49.230
Why are there no spanish/latina
themed mannequins?

17:49.232 --> 17:50.899
Oh, no, no, no, we not talking about that.

17:50.901 --> 17:52.267
Let's talk about this.

17:52.269 --> 17:53.368
Jonah, what is happening?

17:53.370 --> 17:56.137
Do you own one of each of us?

17:56.139 --> 17:57.505
No!

17:57.507 --> 17:59.407
I went to a bunch of
different stores over lunch,

17:59.409 --> 18:01.509
and then I just happened
to pass this in the window

18:01.511 --> 18:04.279
of a sex shop, and look,
it looks just like Amy.

18:04.281 --> 18:05.281
All: Whoa!

18:05.282 --> 18:06.881
- Yeah, it does.
- Ew!

18:06.883 --> 18:08.783
Jonah, can you cover that up, please?

18:08.785 --> 18:11.586
It's completely inappropriate.

18:11.588 --> 18:12.721
All: Oh!

18:12.723 --> 18:14.556
- Problem solved.
- Are you kidding me?

18:14.558 --> 18:16.791
This is not a sexual thing.

18:16.793 --> 18:18.893
Amy, you've got a good butt.

18:20.230 --> 18:23.531
<i>[Upbeat music]</i>

18:23.533 --> 18:24.733
Cheyenne?

18:24.735 --> 18:26.835
We, uh... we let things

18:26.837 --> 18:28.703
get a little out of hand before.

18:28.705 --> 18:29.705
The important thing is,

18:29.706 --> 18:31.039
we are here for you no matter what,

18:31.041 --> 18:32.507
and we want to do whatever's best

18:32.509 --> 18:33.675
for your child.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.745
So that's why we've
agreed to share custody.

18:36.747 --> 18:38.179
- Huh?
- Yeah.

18:38.181 --> 18:39.948
We're gonna alternate nights and weekends.

18:39.950 --> 18:42.650
Yeah, and if both of us have to work late,

18:42.652 --> 18:45.053
then someone else can go home with it.

18:45.055 --> 18:46.554
Jonah. Amy.

18:46.556 --> 18:48.089
Garrett. We'd all trade off.

18:48.091 --> 18:49.624
Like the class hamster

18:49.626 --> 18:51.159
each child gets a turn taking care of,

18:51.161 --> 18:52.994
this would be kind of the store baby.

18:52.996 --> 18:54.496
Exactly.

18:54.498 --> 18:56.431
Thank you so much,

18:56.433 --> 18:58.967
but I think Bo and I are gonna keep it.

19:00.303 --> 19:01.469
You sure?

19:01.471 --> 19:03.505
Think what's best for the baby.

19:03.507 --> 19:06.241
That's what I'm doing.

19:06.243 --> 19:08.743
And you know what?

19:08.745 --> 19:10.712
I think we're gonna be fine.

19:12.983 --> 19:15.350
So this whole day was a
waste of my time, then.

19:24.194 --> 19:25.927
Hey. Glad I caught you.

19:25.929 --> 19:27.662
[Sighs]

19:27.664 --> 19:28.897
What is this?

19:28.899 --> 19:30.131
That is a receipt,

19:30.133 --> 19:32.600
which is proof that I returned the doll.

19:32.602 --> 19:35.103
Uh-huh. Wow.

19:35.105 --> 19:37.305
You paid a $400 restocking fee.

19:37.307 --> 19:39.307
Yeah, it was actually
more than the doll cost.

19:39.309 --> 19:41.309
Um, apparently there's not

19:41.311 --> 19:44.379
a huge after market for used sex dolls.

19:44.381 --> 19:46.080
Ew.

19:46.082 --> 19:52.086
Anyway, I figured out what
today was really about.

19:53.456 --> 19:54.489
You did?

19:54.491 --> 19:55.890
Mm-hmm.

19:55.892 --> 19:57.425
Did Garrett talk to you?

19:57.427 --> 20:00.094
Because that is ridiculous.
That is not what we...

20:00.096 --> 20:02.797
you were hazing me.

20:02.799 --> 20:04.499
Yeah.

20:04.501 --> 20:06.467
Yeah, hazing.

20:06.469 --> 20:08.002
That's... it's what we do to everybody.

20:08.004 --> 20:09.571
You got me. You got me.

20:09.573 --> 20:13.107
I mean, it got a little out
of control, but you passed.

20:13.109 --> 20:15.476
I passed! I passed the initiation.

20:15.478 --> 20:16.611
Congrats.

20:16.613 --> 20:18.680
So I'm, uh, part of the group now.

20:18.682 --> 20:20.949
- Yep, welcome, officially.
- Thank you.

20:20.951 --> 20:22.150
All right.

20:22.152 --> 20:23.518
I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.553
Yep, we'll see everyone tomorrow.

20:28.625 --> 20:29.958
Right there, big ol' wheels.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.392
Oh, this could be bangin'.

20:31.394 --> 20:32.994
- How about this one?
- Oh, yeah.

20:32.996 --> 20:34.662
We trick this thing out right, you know?

20:34.664 --> 20:36.798
Get my uncle to throw some
tint up on the sides here,

20:36.800 --> 20:38.400
so we don't have, like, people peeping in

20:38.401 --> 20:40.702
on shorty's little business going on here?

20:40.704 --> 20:42.036
Yeah.
