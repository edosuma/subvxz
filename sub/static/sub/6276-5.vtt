00:12.500 --> 00:14.500
Previously on  Ray Donovan...

00:14.583 --> 00:16.291
Try this one.
ABBY: You're a cop.

00:16.375 --> 00:17.917
Well, you never know when
you're gonna get in trouble.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.458
If you do, give me a call.

00:19.542 --> 00:20.166
We met today at the gun range.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.417
I'm going back there tomorrow.

00:25.458 --> 00:28.041
MICKEY: What'd your father say
about what happened?

00:28.125 --> 00:29.667
He was supposed to take me
to the kid's house to apologize.

00:29.750 --> 00:32.166
Donovans don't apologize.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.375
RE-KON:
It's your new birthday, son.

00:33.458 --> 00:35.250
You got a whole new life
ahead of you.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.458
Thanks, Re-Kon.

00:36.542 --> 00:37.792
BRIDGET: Jesus, Marvin,
what are you doing here?

00:37.875 --> 00:38.917
My dad will kill you.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.208
I miss you, Bridg.

00:40.291 --> 00:41.750
I've gone to some very bad
places in my life

00:41.834 --> 00:43.917
trying to be brave.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.083
So have I.

00:45.166 --> 00:46.750
LINDA:
So we have that in common.

00:46.834 --> 00:48.583
MICKEY: It's not the way
things are done, Sully.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.125
You kill a woman
for passion.

00:50.208 --> 00:51.834
This is business.
(gunshot)

00:51.917 --> 00:52.709
DEB:
This is Abby Donovan.

00:52.792 --> 00:55.458
Maybe your new neighbor.

00:55.542 --> 00:57.709
Oh, you're from Boston.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.500
I find it charming.

00:59.583 --> 01:00.917
Why are you talking like that?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.667
(flat American accent):
Whatever do you mean?

01:02.750 --> 01:04.458
(moaning)
KATE: Just because we fucked

01:04.542 --> 01:06.000
doesn't mean I won't do my job.

01:06.083 --> 01:07.500
Can I see you again?

01:07.583 --> 01:08.542
COCHRAN:
This asshole was fucking

01:08.625 --> 01:10.083
mouthing off to a detective.

01:10.166 --> 01:11.917
Said he was on the docks
the night that Sully got shot.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.166
Don't kill him.
COCHRAN: Who said anything
about killing anybody?

01:14.250 --> 01:15.375
(gunshot)

01:15.458 --> 01:16.125
(groans)

01:16.208 --> 01:18.917
Kate McPherson, Boston Globe.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.667
I got a story for you.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.041
I'll need to speak
with you in person.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.083
Can you meet me?
RAY: You talk to my father,

01:23.166 --> 01:24.625
your life is in danger.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.125
I'm texting you an address.

01:26.208 --> 01:26.709
Will you be there?

01:26.792 --> 01:28.667

(sighs)

02:26.625 --> 02:28.959
Go ahead, Con.

02:32.041 --> 02:34.542
(sighs)
Okay.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.625
I shouldn't have pushed
you down the stairs.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.667
But you did break my phone.

02:46.000 --> 02:46.583
(scoffs)

02:46.667 --> 02:48.917
Is that it?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.208
Go on.

02:50.291 --> 02:51.208
Go on, what? I said I
shouldn't have done it.

02:51.291 --> 02:55.834
I didn't hear the words,
"I'm sorry."

02:56.959 --> 03:00.291
Tell him you're sorry.

03:00.375 --> 03:02.291
Dad, it's okay. We're friends.
Hey.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.041
Is he gonna apologize or not?

03:06.375 --> 03:06.667
Conor.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.834
What?

03:08.917 --> 03:10.875
Say you're sorry.

03:10.959 --> 03:12.792
He shouldn't make me a bitch.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.125
Hey.
A bitch?

03:14.208 --> 03:16.458
Is this what you teach him?
You don't talk

03:16.542 --> 03:17.750
to us like that.
Relax.

03:17.834 --> 03:18.750
Look at me when I'm talking,

03:18.834 --> 03:19.583
you little dick.
This is over.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.959
Over?

03:22.041 --> 03:23.250
Come on, Con, let's go.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.583
He broke my kid's collarbone,
for Christ's sake.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.583
He's a menace!

03:28.667 --> 03:30.625
You're gonna hear
from my lawyer!

03:47.917 --> 03:49.208
(sighs)

03:55.625 --> 03:57.458
(exhales)

04:00.166 --> 04:02.375
You blocked me in
at the boxing gym.

04:03.875 --> 04:05.875
Ray sent me to watch you.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.375
I'm staying with
you all day.

04:07.458 --> 04:07.959
Have a bagel.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.917
I have things to do.

04:11.667 --> 04:14.125
Ray told me to show you this.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.208
You know who that is, right?

04:18.291 --> 04:19.375
Kenneth Benson.

04:19.458 --> 04:22.041
Tiny. He was part
of Sully's gang.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.083
Ray was not kidding.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.834
Things are dangerous now.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.125
I can take care of myself.

04:28.709 --> 04:31.625
(sighs)

04:39.000 --> 04:40.458
(phone rings)

04:42.333 --> 04:43.709
(chirps)
Yeah?

04:43.792 --> 04:46.000
Couple of guys took your father
last night.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.000
What do you mean, "took him"?

04:48.083 --> 04:48.792
Took him.

04:48.875 --> 04:51.458
They kidnapped him!

04:51.542 --> 04:53.041
They broke the
fucking door down!

04:53.125 --> 04:54.208
Those guys were pros!

04:54.291 --> 04:55.417
Hey, shut up.
Big time!

04:55.500 --> 04:56.875
Sit the fuck down.
Someone took Grandpa?

04:56.959 --> 04:57.792
Find him.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.959
Do your job.

05:00.041 --> 05:02.208
(sighs) What the fuck
do you think I'm doing?

05:02.291 --> 05:04.417
(softly):
Piece of sh...

05:04.500 --> 05:06.000
(sighs)

05:06.083 --> 05:07.125
Don't worry, Conor.

05:07.208 --> 05:08.375
That was his parole officer.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.542
He'll find him.

05:11.208 --> 05:12.542
Dad?

05:12.625 --> 05:14.834
Did he really kill somebody?

05:17.333 --> 05:20.041
I don't want
to talk about it, Con.

05:20.125 --> 05:23.083
It was a long time ago.

05:27.208 --> 05:30.041
Oh, I heard from
Senator Feinstein's office.

05:30.125 --> 05:33.792
We are set for the
fund-raiser tonight.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.000
Head table.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.250
Good.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.583
Oh, sweetie, look
at those scratches.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.417
Let me get you some Neosporin.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.709
You were a real
tiger last night.

05:49.792 --> 05:51.542
Never seen you
like that before.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.166
Ed, what's wrong?

05:55.250 --> 05:56.500
Loose ends. I just...

05:56.583 --> 05:57.917
I'm cleaning
them up today, though.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.542
That is right, babe.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.250
You don't let anything
distract you.

06:03.333 --> 06:07.125
You have to be on point tonight
with Senator Feinstein.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.542
She's a gun-hating liberal.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.000
She is the senior member
of the judiciary committee,

06:14.083 --> 06:15.917
and we are going
to need her support

06:16.041 --> 06:16.875
for your confirmation.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.083
Yeah.

06:18.166 --> 06:21.792
Eddie, keep your eyes

06:21.875 --> 06:23.792
on the prize.

06:23.875 --> 06:24.375
You're right.

06:24.458 --> 06:27.125
You're right, as usual.

06:27.208 --> 06:29.834
(laughing):
Hey, hey.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.750
Hey, Frank.

06:35.834 --> 06:38.959
Oh, fuck!

06:40.083 --> 06:41.000
Where's my father?

06:41.083 --> 06:43.083
I don't know!

06:43.166 --> 06:45.458
(grunts)
Your guys took him.

06:45.542 --> 06:46.333
Where'd you put him?
I don't know

06:46.417 --> 06:48.792
and I don't give a shit.
Yeah?

06:48.875 --> 06:49.625
(groaning)

06:51.333 --> 06:53.250
Oh! Fuck!

06:54.166 --> 06:56.000
(groans)

06:58.208 --> 06:59.583
Where is he, Frank?

06:59.667 --> 07:01.291
You think Cochran
tells me anything?

07:01.375 --> 07:02.792
He doesn't tell me shit.

07:02.875 --> 07:03.959
He tells you to kill people.

07:04.041 --> 07:05.583
He made me kill
that poor fat fucker.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.041
It was like killing
a fucking dog.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.709
Oh, fuck!

07:08.792 --> 07:10.000
Where's my father, Frank?

07:10.083 --> 07:11.583
I don't know!
Cochran's cut me out!

07:11.667 --> 07:13.750
Then give me something
I can use against him.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.000
I think he's clean.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.417
All right, all right! Fuck!

07:19.917 --> 07:21.542
There's a rumor that
he's fucking someone's wife.

07:21.625 --> 07:23.250
Who?
(panting)

07:23.333 --> 07:25.208
His ASAC, Volcheck.

07:25.959 --> 07:28.166
Fuck.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.583
(grunting)

07:30.667 --> 07:31.792
Fuck!

07:31.875 --> 07:33.208
That was for Tiny.

07:34.792 --> 07:35.500
(beeping)

07:35.583 --> 07:38.834
BRIDGET:
Mama, I'm getting sick.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.875
I think I should stay
home from school.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.500
Okay.

07:42.583 --> 07:43.625
Okay?

07:46.542 --> 07:47.083
What's that?

07:47.166 --> 07:49.709
It's a gun.

07:49.792 --> 07:51.667
Your father gave it to me.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.166
What's it for?

07:53.250 --> 07:56.041
I shoot it at a range.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.000
It's a sport.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.709
I really think I'm sick.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.625
Feel my head.

08:02.166 --> 08:04.625
Oh, it feels fine.

08:04.709 --> 08:06.291
You barely touched it.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.959
Do you want to see a doctor?

08:09.041 --> 08:10.333
No, but...

08:11.875 --> 08:13.125
So stay home.

08:13.208 --> 08:15.125
You're making straight A's.

08:17.166 --> 08:20.125
Don't you want to
check my temperature?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.208
There's a thermometer
in the bathroom.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.375
(chuckles)

08:50.458 --> 08:52.583
Mickey disappeared last night.

08:53.875 --> 08:54.959
Call Steve Davis.

08:55.041 --> 08:55.917
See if he knows anything.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.166
Okay, boss.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.959
You want me to check
the morgue, too?

08:59.041 --> 08:59.667
No, not yet.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.750
Yeah, Officer Steve Davis?

09:14.291 --> 09:16.458
Look at the time.

09:16.542 --> 09:17.583
What about it?

09:17.667 --> 09:19.709
Director of the Los Angeles FBI

09:19.792 --> 09:23.375
socializing with his ASAC
until 2:00 in the morning.

09:23.458 --> 09:24.959
Cochran's supposed
to be fucking her.

09:25.041 --> 09:26.291
See if you can find any proof.

09:26.375 --> 09:27.625
Okay.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.542
Excuse me, can you tell me where
Frank Barnes keeps his boat?

09:59.041 --> 10:01.041
Special Agent Barnes.

10:01.125 --> 10:04.333
I've been trying to talk to
you for the past few days.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.458
I'm a reporter for
The Boston Globe,

10:06.542 --> 10:08.208
and for some reason, your
boss won't let me near you.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.458
You want to tell me why?

10:10.542 --> 10:11.959
(sighs)

10:12.041 --> 10:13.166
No comment.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.542
Nobody could catch Sully,

10:19.625 --> 10:20.709
but you did.
You ought to get

10:20.792 --> 10:23.375
some attention for it,
not just a medal.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.750
Leave me alone.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.333
What happened to your face?

10:31.792 --> 10:33.417
I know your boss is lying.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.208
Sully didn't arrive in
L.A. when he said he did.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.500
I also know that Mickey Donovan
was on the docks

10:38.583 --> 10:40.834
the night Sully was killed.

10:40.917 --> 10:43.250
Maybe the FBI didn't have
a plan to catch Sully.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.542
Maybe they just got lucky.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.750
Come on, Frank.

10:47.834 --> 10:48.583
What is Cochran hiding?

10:48.667 --> 10:51.750
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

10:53.291 --> 10:53.792
What did you just say?

10:58.333 --> 11:00.250
Nothing.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.458
Frank!

11:08.542 --> 11:11.417
Why would someone want
to kill me?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.417
Who beat you up, Frank?

11:13.500 --> 11:14.875
Ask your fucking boyfriend.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.291
Are you talking
about Ray Donovan?

11:17.375 --> 11:19.458
(panting)

11:35.834 --> 11:38.500
(engine starts)

11:45.250 --> 11:48.125
(phone ringing)

11:52.625 --> 11:53.250
Yeah?

11:53.333 --> 11:55.875
She ditched me.

11:55.959 --> 11:56.875
I lost her.

11:56.959 --> 11:57.625
Damn it, Av.
What can I do?

11:57.709 --> 11:59.792
She jumped on a fucking boat!

12:01.875 --> 12:04.792
(phone rings)

12:04.875 --> 12:05.458
Conor?

12:05.542 --> 12:07.709
Dad? Did you find Grandpa?

12:07.792 --> 12:09.083
He's gonna be fine, Con.

12:09.166 --> 12:10.208
How do you know?

12:11.709 --> 12:13.333
There's no one out there
who wants to hurt him.

12:13.417 --> 12:14.834
You did!
I did what?

12:14.917 --> 12:15.625
You pistol-whipped him,
remember?

12:15.709 --> 12:17.583
Yeah, well, that was different.

12:17.667 --> 12:19.792
Are you really looking for him?

12:19.875 --> 12:22.834
Conor, your grandfather's
gonna be fine.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.000
(grunting)

12:52.000 --> 12:53.542
You like it? You like it?!

12:53.625 --> 12:54.792
Put me in a fucking cage!

12:54.875 --> 12:55.917
You think you can scare me?!

12:56.000 --> 12:59.417
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

12:59.500 --> 13:01.583
(gunfire)

13:31.125 --> 13:33.375
Are those real diamonds?

13:33.458 --> 13:34.750
(laughs)

13:34.834 --> 13:36.000
Of course they real, Shawty.

13:40.792 --> 13:43.458
You know, I don't need
both of these.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.041
Really?

13:46.125 --> 13:47.166
Come here.

13:48.542 --> 13:52.250
Take that one out.

13:59.208 --> 14:01.083
(quiet laugh)

14:01.166 --> 14:03.917
You wear one
and I wear one.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.875
What's this for?

14:05.959 --> 14:07.083
'Cause you're mine.

14:10.625 --> 14:11.125
I love it!

14:13.458 --> 14:15.542
Thank you.

14:18.375 --> 14:20.375
(phone chimes)

14:20.458 --> 14:22.542
Sorry.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.166
You want to go to a party?

14:56.959 --> 14:58.291
SHORTY:
What the fuck are you doing?

14:58.375 --> 15:00.917
I'm looking for
Mickey Donovan.

15:01.000 --> 15:01.917
What for?

15:02.000 --> 15:02.959
I'm a reporter.

15:03.041 --> 15:05.333
Oh, he was waiting
for you last night!

15:05.417 --> 15:06.375
Oh, he had
some important shit

15:06.458 --> 15:08.709
to tell you.

15:08.792 --> 15:09.834
Da Vinci Code-type  shit.

15:09.917 --> 15:13.583
Now, I don't know
where he's at.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.750
Maybe the Vatican.

15:15.834 --> 15:17.709
They're probably torturing him.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.834
He wanted to give you this.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.792
Well, I'll be on my way.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.000
You need to go back to Boston.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.542
Is this how you
get rid of girls?

15:39.625 --> 15:40.875
You're causing
a lot of headaches

15:40.959 --> 15:42.166
for some very dangerous people.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.166
I'm trying to protect you.

15:43.250 --> 15:46.208
When I was writing
about pedophile priests,

15:46.291 --> 15:48.625
I got death threats
all the time.

15:48.709 --> 15:50.417
That didn't stop me.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.625
Sully didn't die

15:52.709 --> 15:54.333
the way the FBI said he did.

15:54.417 --> 15:55.333
I can't finish

15:55.417 --> 15:57.500
my book until I know
what really happened.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.041
It really bothers
you, doesn't it?

16:02.125 --> 16:04.208
Not being in control?

16:16.875 --> 16:18.333
(cell phone ringing)

16:23.875 --> 16:24.709
Yeah?

16:24.792 --> 16:27.083
I know where he is.

16:27.166 --> 16:28.709
Where?

16:28.792 --> 16:29.792
It's gonna cost you.

16:29.875 --> 16:31.208
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:31.291 --> 16:34.208
Everything I'm doing
for you is illegal.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.208
I could lose my fucking job.

16:36.291 --> 16:37.709
What do you want?

16:38.917 --> 16:42.166
I was at the track yesterday.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.709
And I'm down.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.041
Seven grand?

16:47.875 --> 16:50.709
Go to my office.
The girl will give it to you.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.333
Now, where the fuck
is my father?

16:59.375 --> 17:01.458
(door closes)

17:04.375 --> 17:06.208
It's you.

17:08.542 --> 17:10.041
I want a lawyer.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.125
I know my rights.
I get to make a phone call.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.375
Who'd you call, Mick?

17:13.458 --> 17:14.750
I mean, who the fuck gives
a shit about you? Ray?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.750
For one.
Oh, yeah?

17:17.834 --> 17:20.000
Paid Sully $2 million
to have you killed.

17:20.083 --> 17:23.083
Eh, it's a complicated
relationship.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.959
Maybe you want to call

17:25.041 --> 17:26.333
that fucking reporter.

17:26.417 --> 17:28.875
Oh!

17:28.959 --> 17:30.083
You're spying on me!

17:30.166 --> 17:32.625
That's against the law.
That's against the law.

17:32.709 --> 17:33.709
There's no law here, Mick.
There's just me.

17:33.792 --> 17:36.750
I'm the law! Me!

17:36.834 --> 17:37.792
I'm about

17:37.875 --> 17:40.041
to become the number one
law enforcement officer

17:40.125 --> 17:43.834
in the United States, hell, in
the fucking free world, Mick!

17:43.917 --> 17:45.750
But you Irish Spring,
you Lucky Charms-eating

17:45.834 --> 17:47.417
pieces of fucking shit!

17:47.500 --> 17:49.333
You guys are gonna
bring me down.

17:49.417 --> 17:51.625
Top of the morning to you.

17:51.709 --> 17:52.750
You know, Mick,

17:52.834 --> 17:55.834
I have this ambition.

17:55.917 --> 17:57.875
I don't know where
it comes from.

17:57.959 --> 18:00.166
My whole life I've
been on this path

18:00.250 --> 18:02.792
towards greatness.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.125
I'm disciplined, too.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.166
I don't lie.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.709
I don't cheat on my taxes.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.041
I don't text when I drive.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.709
Regular Boy Scout.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.500
Why does Ray hate you so much?

18:15.583 --> 18:17.125
I wish I could tell you.

18:17.208 --> 18:18.291
You must've done
something to the guy.

18:18.375 --> 18:19.500
What did you do to him?

18:19.583 --> 18:21.667
I missed a few birthdays.

18:21.750 --> 18:22.917
Maybe.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.834
You two are the most
self-destructive,

18:25.917 --> 18:28.542
crazy motherfuckers
that I've ever met!

18:31.959 --> 18:35.125
Just us now, Mick.

18:40.834 --> 18:43.500
It's a statement.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.250
Saying that Ray told you

18:45.333 --> 18:48.041
that he killed Agent Van Miller.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.750
What, you think
I'd let that go?

18:50.834 --> 18:51.709
The murder of a brother agent?

18:51.792 --> 18:53.750
(quiet laugh)

18:53.834 --> 18:56.125
You want to pin it on Ray?

18:56.208 --> 18:57.875
Sign the statement.

18:57.959 --> 18:59.709
I'll send you back to Mexico.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.625
I'm not ratting out my son!

19:04.709 --> 19:07.583
Go fuck yourself.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.291
Okay, Mick.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.875
Enjoy the view.

19:15.959 --> 19:17.583
(door opens)

19:21.208 --> 19:22.709
Can I get some more bullets?

19:24.667 --> 19:26.417
Really getting
your target practice in today.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.291
Yeah. Listen.

19:29.375 --> 19:31.333
There's a cop who shoots here
sometimes, um...

19:31.417 --> 19:33.166
Uh, lots of cops shoot here.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.417
Is there a specific one
that you're interested in?

19:36.917 --> 19:38.333
You know, forget the bullets.
I-I got to go.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.792
Thanks.

19:44.875 --> 19:46.959
Oh.

19:50.709 --> 19:52.000
DEB: Hello?

19:52.083 --> 19:53.041
Hey, Deb.

19:53.125 --> 19:53.917
Hi, Abby.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.667
I want to see
the Trousdale house.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.583
Don't tell me you're having
second thoughts.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.667
No, I-I, I just want to see it.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.542
Can I get in?

20:01.625 --> 20:04.709
Cochran's holding him at the
FBI building in Westwood.

20:04.792 --> 20:05.458
We need to get him
out of there.

20:05.542 --> 20:07.583
We need a
superior court judge.

20:07.667 --> 20:08.583
You know one?

20:08.667 --> 20:10.583
Of course. He's a dear friend.

20:10.667 --> 20:11.083
What's his name?

20:11.166 --> 20:11.875
Raymond, I can't.

20:11.959 --> 20:14.458
I need a name, Ezra.

20:14.542 --> 20:15.542
He's a religious man!

20:15.625 --> 20:19.250
We study Torah together.
He won't break the law.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.375
I'll convince him.

20:20.458 --> 20:21.083
Tikkun olam.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.959
We've committed enough sins.

20:23.041 --> 20:25.417
Mickey's talking
to Cochran.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.709
He could tell him everything.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.709
Sean Walker, Van Miller,

20:28.792 --> 20:30.583
Black Mass, Colleen.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.166
We could go to jail, Ezra.

20:32.250 --> 20:33.458
Irving Salzman.

20:35.041 --> 20:38.709
(door opens)
I feel dirty.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.709
(hip-hop music playing)

20:43.959 --> 20:46.834
(indistinct chatter)

20:49.208 --> 20:50.792
Hey, there's Cookie.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.000
He just got home.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.041
From where?
I thought he was from L.A.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.166
(laughs) No.

20:57.250 --> 20:58.166
Prison, Shawty.

20:58.250 --> 21:01.166
Come on, let's say hi.

21:01.250 --> 21:04.583
Hey, Cookie!

21:04.667 --> 21:05.959
Boy, I love the way
you sing, my nigga.

21:06.041 --> 21:07.000
Hey. Thanks for these.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.041
It's three carats, baby.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.000
I want you to know I
appreciate the talent.

21:10.083 --> 21:13.458
This is my girl, Bridget.

21:13.542 --> 21:15.083
Hi.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.083
How you doing, snowflake?

21:19.208 --> 21:20.709
You know what that is?

21:20.792 --> 21:23.166
Glock 45.

21:23.250 --> 21:23.709
My dad has one.

21:23.792 --> 21:24.792
(laughs)

21:24.875 --> 21:27.125
What is he a cop?

21:27.208 --> 21:29.458
Not exactly.
Well, look here.

21:29.542 --> 21:30.208
You stay away from
guns, all right?

21:30.291 --> 21:33.792
(laughs)
Me and you, young fella?

21:33.875 --> 21:35.959
We need to talk
business real soon.

21:36.041 --> 21:38.125
Any time.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.375
She's cute.

21:41.458 --> 21:42.542
I know.

21:44.417 --> 21:45.208
Yeah, I don't, uh, think

21:45.291 --> 21:48.166
I'll be late tonight,
sweetheart.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.083
I have got a conference
this afternoon,

21:50.166 --> 21:52.542
but I don't think
that should go...

21:54.417 --> 21:56.375
WOMAN:
Irving?

21:56.458 --> 21:58.083
Are you there?

21:58.166 --> 22:00.709
(gasps) Um...

22:00.792 --> 22:03.375
I have to call you back.

22:03.458 --> 22:04.542
What is this?

22:10.291 --> 22:12.709
God!

22:12.792 --> 22:14.709
(cell phone ringing)

22:16.000 --> 22:18.458
Ezra, listen.

22:18.542 --> 22:20.000
Something terrible's
happened and...

22:20.083 --> 22:22.250
Irving, how could you?!

22:22.333 --> 22:23.583
How could I what?

22:23.667 --> 22:25.000
How could you send me this?!

22:25.083 --> 22:26.750
These are children!

22:26.834 --> 22:28.667
Do you know the danger
you've put me in?!

22:28.750 --> 22:29.333
Ezra, believe me.

22:29.417 --> 22:31.041
I didn't send this to you!

22:31.125 --> 22:33.583
This is some horrible mistake!

22:33.667 --> 22:34.792
It's a virus.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.250
What... what do I do?!
Calm down, calm, calm down.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.083
I know someone who can help you.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.166
I'll send him right over.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.625
You're a mensch.

22:43.834 --> 22:45.959
He's ready.

22:47.875 --> 22:48.375
Ray?

22:48.458 --> 22:51.959
He only pledged $5,000

22:52.041 --> 22:53.667
to the RGOCC.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.709
Squeeze him for another 20.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.583
I'll see what I can do.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.375
JUDY:
Hi, there.

23:20.458 --> 23:23.333
I saw your car
in the driveway.

23:23.417 --> 23:25.333
This is Lisa.
Hi.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.125
Hi.

23:27.208 --> 23:29.792
We got off on the wrong
foot the other day.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.458
Peace offering?

23:31.542 --> 23:33.041
(laughs) Sure.

23:33.125 --> 23:34.875
Why not?

23:34.959 --> 23:36.750
Let me find some glasses.

23:36.834 --> 23:40.667
It really is
a beautiful house.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.500
(door opens)

23:52.000 --> 23:54.375
This woman's body was found
in the oil fields

23:54.458 --> 23:56.625
two days ago.

23:56.709 --> 23:59.625
Why don't you tell me
what you know about her?

23:59.709 --> 24:01.208
I've never seen her
before in my life.

24:01.291 --> 24:04.166
Really?

24:04.250 --> 24:05.041
A week before she died,
you were with her

24:05.125 --> 24:07.625
at the, uh...

24:07.709 --> 24:08.166
the Four Seasons Spa.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.583
Don't ring a bell.

24:09.667 --> 24:13.583
Ballistics say the bullet
that killed her

24:13.667 --> 24:15.583
is a match to Sully's gun.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.542
Pretty, huh?

24:26.333 --> 24:29.500
Dogs were chewing on her.

24:29.583 --> 24:31.000
Did you fuck her, Mick?

24:31.083 --> 24:34.959
Yeah.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.834
But I didn't kill her.

24:39.917 --> 24:42.417
Sully did.
All comes back to Sully.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.250
And who brought Sully out here?

24:44.333 --> 24:45.709
Your fucking son.

24:45.792 --> 24:47.709
If he'd have left
Sully in Boston,

24:47.792 --> 24:51.458
she'd still be alive.

24:51.542 --> 24:53.375
And Van Miller.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.041
And Catherine Shaughnessy.

24:55.125 --> 24:55.875
And God knows how many more

24:55.959 --> 24:57.917
freaking bodies
are gonna pop up.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.375
Fucking Donovans,
you're like a...

24:59.458 --> 25:01.166
you're like a virus.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.709
She was a nice lady.

25:03.792 --> 25:05.834
She didn't deserve to
die the way she did.

25:05.917 --> 25:08.417
You don't deserve to spend
the rest of your life in prison.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.000
After all,
you've done your time.

25:10.083 --> 25:12.750
You bet I did.

25:12.834 --> 25:15.083
I can handle you, Mick.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.583
You're a simple man.

25:16.667 --> 25:20.125
You want to eat, drink,
fuck, enjoy your family.

25:20.208 --> 25:20.917
That's right.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.083
Maybe I don't need
to put you away.

25:22.166 --> 25:25.083
But Ray's a problem.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.500
He's out of control.

25:26.583 --> 25:30.083
And I'm not gonna
let him fuck up my plans.

25:30.166 --> 25:33.500
So, which one of you
goes to prison?

25:33.583 --> 25:33.792
You or Ray?

25:36.417 --> 25:39.333
You think about that, old man.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.375
I'll be back in an hour.

26:00.083 --> 26:02.834
I'm a religious man!
I don't visit that kind of site!

26:02.917 --> 26:04.917
I don't know how this

26:05.000 --> 26:05.959
got onto my computer!

26:06.041 --> 26:07.792
(spoofy '90s techno music plays
over laptop)

26:09.875 --> 26:11.166
Unfortunately, once it's
on your system,

26:11.250 --> 26:12.917
it's almost impossible
to get rid of it.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.083
Oh, my God.

26:14.166 --> 26:16.375
Ezra's pretty upset you put it
on his system as well.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.208
I didn't send this filth
to Ezra.

26:18.291 --> 26:21.166
I...
(sighs)

26:21.250 --> 26:22.125
Look...

26:22.208 --> 26:24.000
I have five grandchildren;
I worship them.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.333
You understand?

26:26.417 --> 26:27.709
This is the end of me;

26:27.792 --> 26:30.333
it's the end of my career.

26:30.417 --> 26:31.667
Oh, my God,

26:31.750 --> 26:33.583
what'll my wife think?

26:34.792 --> 26:35.208
(sighs)

26:35.291 --> 26:38.500
I didn't do this.

26:40.875 --> 26:42.375
I know you didn't.

26:44.792 --> 26:48.000
It's not gonna be easy,
but, uh...

26:48.083 --> 26:50.083
I can make this go away for you.

26:54.875 --> 26:57.375
You sons of bitches.

26:57.458 --> 27:00.709
What do you want?

27:00.792 --> 27:02.250
(women chuckling)
JUDY:
I want to do it.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.542
Oh, I, I-I need to
park my car.

27:04.625 --> 27:06.750
(laughing):
No...!

27:06.834 --> 27:08.583
(in Boston accent):
Park my car.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.709
(imitates accent):
Park my car.

27:10.792 --> 27:12.750
Yes, you're a Southie!

27:12.834 --> 27:13.959
(laughing):
Yes!

27:14.041 --> 27:14.375
(gasps)

27:14.458 --> 27:17.041
Oh, my God.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.041
I drank too fast,

27:18.125 --> 27:19.417
I think
I'm gonna throw up.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.041
Should we help you out
to your...

27:21.125 --> 27:22.083
(in Boston accent):
car...?

27:22.166 --> 27:22.458
(women laughing hysterically)

27:22.542 --> 27:24.250
Shut up!

27:24.333 --> 27:26.041
(gasps)
What?

27:26.125 --> 27:27.959
I'm sorry.

27:28.041 --> 27:29.542
(sighs)

27:29.625 --> 27:31.000
I don't feel good.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.500
I think this is a mistake;

27:34.583 --> 27:37.083
I-I don't even like this house

27:37.166 --> 27:38.709
anymore.

27:38.792 --> 27:39.875
Where do you shop?

27:39.959 --> 27:40.875
Where's the market?

27:40.959 --> 27:42.500
Where's the post office?

27:42.583 --> 27:43.542
Darling, it's Trousdale.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.250
I'm sure it's
a lot more convenient

27:45.333 --> 27:47.041
than Calabasas.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.458
But...

27:49.542 --> 27:50.709
it's not for everyone.

27:50.792 --> 27:53.417
What does that mean?

27:53.500 --> 27:54.458
We know all about
your husband.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.875
I mean, we know what he does.

27:56.959 --> 27:58.500
When you're ready
to ditch him,

27:58.583 --> 27:59.959
Blanche Blaylock is a

28:00.041 --> 28:01.291
personal friend of mine.

28:01.375 --> 28:02.500
She'll get you
a good deal.

28:02.583 --> 28:05.166
I'm not leaving
my fucking husband.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.000
Maybe that's what
you people do;

28:07.083 --> 28:08.542
where I come from,
we stick it out.

28:08.625 --> 28:10.542
Ray's a good provider--

28:10.625 --> 28:11.375
he's a loving father.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.625
Oh, honey,
let's face it...

28:12.709 --> 28:15.250
(laughing):
he's basically a street thug.

28:15.333 --> 28:17.750
(women screaming)

28:17.834 --> 28:21.583
(shouting): Who the fuck
do you think you are?!

28:21.667 --> 28:22.917
You let go of me!

28:23.000 --> 28:23.959
Call the police!

28:24.041 --> 28:25.291
Call the police.

28:25.375 --> 28:26.583
I'll call my fucking husband
and he'll kill you.

28:26.667 --> 28:28.834
JUDY:
You're in fucking trouble!

28:28.917 --> 28:30.458
You can't hurt me!

28:30.542 --> 28:31.500
(sighs)

28:31.583 --> 28:33.458
(gasps)

28:33.542 --> 28:35.625
(sighs)

28:43.667 --> 28:45.834
(panting)

28:45.917 --> 28:48.291
(phone clicking)

28:50.709 --> 28:52.709
Are you ready?

28:52.792 --> 28:54.291
Yeah, in a minute.

28:54.375 --> 28:55.166
Help me out here,
I can't...

28:55.250 --> 28:58.166
I can't reach.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.583
Come on.

29:00.333 --> 29:01.792
Last thing I need

29:01.875 --> 29:03.291
are for these things
to get infected.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.792
(sniffs)

29:05.875 --> 29:06.417
I usually...

29:06.500 --> 29:08.583
Get the bottom part, huh?

29:08.667 --> 29:09.709
(sighs)

29:09.792 --> 29:12.041
(grunts)
Yeah, that's it.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.208
Just get a...

29:13.291 --> 29:14.500
a little, uh,

29:14.583 --> 29:16.166
a little higher.

29:19.542 --> 29:21.917
I'm getting
tired of this.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.500
Really?

29:23.583 --> 29:25.000
So what?

29:25.333 --> 29:27.291
Come on.

29:27.375 --> 29:30.041
Let's go nail this

29:30.125 --> 29:31.667
leprechaun-loving
asshole.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.709
FBI AGENT:
This is an FBI operation.

29:35.792 --> 29:36.875
DETECTIVE:
We're stepping in.

29:36.959 --> 29:38.041
FBI AGENT:
Yeah, hold-hold on.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.125
DETECTIVE:
No, we're taking him.

29:39.208 --> 29:40.583
What the hell
is this?

29:40.667 --> 29:42.000
All right, what
is LAPD doing here?

29:42.083 --> 29:44.041
FBI AGENT:
You can't just come in here
and take a suspect.

29:44.125 --> 29:45.291
DETECTIVE:
I have a warrant, asshole.

29:45.375 --> 29:46.625
Whoa, what the fuck
is going on in here?

29:46.709 --> 29:48.166
LAPD,
we're taking him.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.375
No. No. No. This man
is in my custody.

29:49.458 --> 29:50.250
Have you
arrested him?

29:50.333 --> 29:51.125
We're holding him
for questioning.

29:51.208 --> 29:52.709
Mickey Donovan,
you're under arrest.

29:52.792 --> 29:53.834
I thought I already was.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.542
You have been remanded
into the custody of

29:55.625 --> 29:56.959
Judge Irving Salzman.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

29:57.041 --> 29:58.041
You have the right
to remain silent;

29:58.125 --> 29:59.333
Hey! Hey!
anything you say can

29:59.417 --> 30:00.333
and will be
used against you...
Back the fuck off!

30:00.417 --> 30:01.542
Judge Salzman's declared him
a material witness

30:01.625 --> 30:03.625
for one of his cases.

30:03.709 --> 30:05.041
I don't give a shit.
I'm the fucking FBI!

30:05.125 --> 30:06.417
The judge's order
trumps your authority.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.542
Let's go.

30:08.625 --> 30:10.208
You, you got to be
kidding me.

30:10.291 --> 30:12.166
And if you try to stop us,
you'll be obstructing justice.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.208
Well, I'll fucking
have your badge, pal.

30:13.291 --> 30:15.375
You'll be working security
at fucking Home Depot!

30:15.458 --> 30:18.208
You got me wrong, pal.

30:18.291 --> 30:19.333
I'd never give up my son.

30:19.417 --> 30:20.417
Go fuck yourself.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.875
(phone chiming)

30:22.959 --> 30:24.542
(sighs)

30:24.625 --> 30:25.125
Donovan.

30:25.208 --> 30:27.291
(scoffs)

30:27.375 --> 30:29.375
You motherfucker.

30:29.458 --> 30:30.625
You motherfucker!

30:30.709 --> 30:32.250
Sorry to spoil your party,

30:32.333 --> 30:33.500
but I need to see my father.

30:33.583 --> 30:34.750
I don't know
how you did this,

30:34.834 --> 30:36.625
but I promise  you
I'm gonna nail you for it.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.583
No, you're not;
you're gonna thank me.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.750
(hip-hop music playing)

30:40.834 --> 30:43.250
(indistinct conversations)

30:43.333 --> 30:44.500
So, uh, how long

30:44.583 --> 30:45.375
have you known Cookie?

30:45.458 --> 30:48.041
Mm, couple weeks.

30:48.125 --> 30:50.667
Since he got out.

30:50.750 --> 30:53.250
Why do you think
he gave you these earrings?

30:53.333 --> 30:54.750
They must've been
really expensive.

30:54.834 --> 30:58.417
Shawty, when you a,
when you a star,

30:58.500 --> 31:00.083
you know,
people give you shit.

31:00.166 --> 31:02.417
Don't be all
cynical, girl,

31:02.500 --> 31:05.125
it's all love.

31:05.208 --> 31:06.500
GIRL (sweetly):
Hi, Marvin.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.041
(sighs)

31:15.166 --> 31:16.750
Hey, Bridg,
what's wrong?

31:17.709 --> 31:18.792
Why would you want me

31:18.875 --> 31:21.709
when you can have
girls like her?

31:22.458 --> 31:24.625
Who'd I give that
earring to...

31:24.709 --> 31:26.959
her or you?

31:28.166 --> 31:29.333
I'm gonna
show you something.

31:35.709 --> 31:38.667
(coughs, laughs)
(laughs)

31:42.375 --> 31:44.750
Where ya taking me,
back to my shithole?

31:44.834 --> 31:47.417
No, we got to do
something first.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.083
I stood by you, Ray.

31:49.166 --> 31:51.083
Didn't give you up.

31:51.166 --> 31:52.458
You know, I would
never do that.

31:52.542 --> 31:53.333
Sure you would.

31:53.417 --> 31:54.917
I just got you
out of there in time.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.625
Ray Ray, when are you
gonna realize

31:56.709 --> 31:58.667
that I'm not the devil?

31:58.750 --> 31:59.500
All right.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.667
(sighs)

32:01.750 --> 32:04.000
I'll give you a chance
to prove it.

32:04.083 --> 32:04.709
All you got to do is
tell a little story.

32:04.792 --> 32:07.917
What's in it for me?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.083
(scoffs)
Christ, Mick,

32:10.166 --> 32:11.041
what do you want?

32:11.125 --> 32:13.083
I don't want to
peel carrots no more.

32:13.166 --> 32:14.834
It's humiliating.

32:14.917 --> 32:15.500
And I want a...
uh...

32:15.583 --> 32:17.625
what do you call it?

32:17.709 --> 32:18.959
A stipend.

32:21.750 --> 32:22.917
(softly laughs, sighs)

32:23.000 --> 32:24.500
That's it?

32:25.583 --> 32:27.875
And I want to see my grandkids.

32:32.709 --> 32:36.375
(phone clinks, dings)

32:36.458 --> 32:37.083
(phone chimes)

32:38.583 --> 32:40.625
Yeah.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.709
(sighs): I need you to
meet me somewhere.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.792
Why should I do anything
you ask me to do?

32:44.875 --> 32:47.917
Because I'm gonna give you
the end of your book.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.083
Kate?

32:50.166 --> 32:51.583
You still there?

32:51.667 --> 32:54.583
(hip-hop music playing)

32:58.291 --> 33:00.375
This is nice.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.083
Mm.

33:02.166 --> 33:03.417
Told you, didn't I?

33:03.500 --> 33:04.709
(inhales)

33:04.792 --> 33:06.417
I'm gonna go grab a soda.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.041
(chuckles)
All right, all right.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.000
(giggles)
I'll take a beer.

33:11.333 --> 33:13.875
Mm.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.125
(indistinct conversations)

33:21.291 --> 33:23.458
You're supposed to be
home studying.

33:23.834 --> 33:26.625
Well-well,

33:26.709 --> 33:28.000
we celebrating,
Cookie's back.

33:28.083 --> 33:29.709
Back from where, fool?

33:29.792 --> 33:30.875
Prison?

33:30.959 --> 33:32.000
That's where
you want to be?

33:32.083 --> 33:35.333
What you need to do,
is be working with that

33:35.417 --> 33:36.834
tutor I got for you.

33:36.917 --> 33:38.458
What's that shit in your ear?

33:38.542 --> 33:39.125
Cookie gave it to me.

33:39.208 --> 33:41.083
Well, give that shit back.

33:41.166 --> 33:42.625
I thought Cookie
and you was tight.

33:42.709 --> 33:44.375
Yeah, well, that was

33:44.458 --> 33:45.125
a long time ago, shit changes.

33:48.542 --> 33:49.750
(sighs)

33:49.834 --> 33:52.250
That's Ray Donovan's daughter.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.166
Yeah. So?

33:56.250 --> 33:57.834
Have you lost your
motherfucking mind?

33:57.917 --> 34:00.166
He almost killed you.

34:00.250 --> 34:02.166
And take her pasty,
white ass home.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.333
You know, I don't even got to
fucking listen to you.

34:04.417 --> 34:05.792
I'm making the
fucking money now.

34:05.875 --> 34:06.583
Marvin,

34:06.667 --> 34:09.041
I'm trying to
protect you, son.

34:09.125 --> 34:11.041
You need to listen to me.

34:11.125 --> 34:12.291
What's going on?

34:13.500 --> 34:16.625
Nothing.

34:16.709 --> 34:18.667
We got to go,
that's all.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.792
(mouthing)

34:37.375 --> 34:39.041
This better be good.

34:42.375 --> 34:43.625
EZRA:
What an honor

34:43.709 --> 34:46.166
to meet such a talented

34:46.250 --> 34:47.917
and award-winning writer.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.041
Are you Jewish?

34:49.125 --> 34:49.542
Uh, no.

34:49.625 --> 34:51.583
Too bad.

34:51.667 --> 34:53.709
The best writers
usually are.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.959
Bernard Malamud,
Philip Roth, Kafka.

34:55.041 --> 34:57.792
But I'm sure
you're good, too.

34:57.875 --> 34:59.583
Please, uh,

34:59.667 --> 35:01.375
help yourself
to coffee,

35:01.458 --> 35:02.375
seltzer, pastries...

35:02.458 --> 35:03.500
Look, can we get on
with this, please?

35:03.583 --> 35:05.583
I'm going to
excuse myself.

35:05.667 --> 35:06.417
Believe it or not,

35:06.500 --> 35:09.166
I have a wife
and a baby at home.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.417
Not my baby,
of course.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.166
(door closes)

35:12.250 --> 35:14.500
Take a seat.

35:24.792 --> 35:26.417
You were right...

35:26.500 --> 35:27.667
I've been lying to you

35:27.750 --> 35:28.750
and I've been trying to

35:28.834 --> 35:30.041
keep you from
talking to my father.

35:30.125 --> 35:32.583
But not for the reasons
you think.

35:38.542 --> 35:40.792
My father and I have been
working with the FBI.

35:48.625 --> 35:50.542
(indistinct radio transmission)

35:50.625 --> 35:52.250
(policemen speaking
indistinctly)

35:54.041 --> 35:55.875
Be safe.
I appreciate it.

35:55.959 --> 35:57.375
Owe you one.
Take care.

35:57.458 --> 35:59.333
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:04.291 --> 36:04.709
Hey, slugger.

36:04.792 --> 36:07.083
You all right?

36:07.166 --> 36:10.542
I should of
smashed her fucking face in.

36:10.625 --> 36:12.166
Am I under arrest?

36:12.250 --> 36:13.667
No. I talked them out of
pressing charges.

36:13.750 --> 36:16.417
Thank you.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.375
Now, let's get you home.

36:20.583 --> 36:23.041
Can you just come
sit beside me for a second?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.625
I don't want to go home.

36:39.375 --> 36:39.750
Can we go to a hotel

36:39.834 --> 36:41.875
and have sex?

36:41.959 --> 36:43.583
(laughs)

36:45.000 --> 36:46.458
I'm serious.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.417
I know.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.333
Look, I really like you.

36:52.417 --> 36:53.625
But I've been in

36:53.709 --> 36:55.417
situations
like this before;

36:55.500 --> 36:56.166
you're emotional.
(crying)

36:56.250 --> 36:59.291
I don't want to
take advantage.

36:59.375 --> 37:00.500
(whispers):
Hey.

37:04.208 --> 37:06.291
(sobs)

37:06.375 --> 37:08.000
(sniffs)

37:08.083 --> 37:10.166
Will you just
hold me, please?!

37:11.291 --> 37:12.625
(sniffs)

37:12.709 --> 37:16.125
(whimpers)

37:16.208 --> 37:17.208
(sniffs)

37:17.291 --> 37:17.917
(shudders)

37:18.000 --> 37:20.583
(laughing)
(softly laughs)

37:25.875 --> 37:27.625
We knew we'd never
get our hands on Sully,

37:27.709 --> 37:29.000
as long as
he was in Boston.

37:29.083 --> 37:30.792
We wanted him out here, where
he was isolated and....

37:30.875 --> 37:31.667
easier to grab.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.667
RAY:
And my father
was the bait.

37:33.750 --> 37:34.500
Tell her, Dad.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.583
You ever...

37:38.667 --> 37:41.125
you ever see a,
a worm on a hook?

37:42.083 --> 37:43.125
That was me.

37:43.208 --> 37:45.667
Sully was in hiding--

37:45.750 --> 37:47.083
how did you contact him?

37:47.166 --> 37:48.000
Mr. Donovan had a

37:48.083 --> 37:49.959
relationship with Sully

37:50.041 --> 37:51.417
that we felt that...
I got this one.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.959
(sighs)

37:53.041 --> 37:53.917
Me and Sully were
good pals,

37:54.000 --> 37:54.834
back in the day.

37:54.917 --> 37:57.333
We kept in touch...
If you and Sully

37:57.417 --> 37:58.709
were such good pals,

37:58.792 --> 38:00.750
then why did Mrs. Sullivan
call you a rat?

38:05.375 --> 38:07.959
That old broad is a racist.

38:08.041 --> 38:10.083
She hates me, because I
fell in love with a black woman.

38:10.166 --> 38:11.166
You ever been in love?

38:11.250 --> 38:12.667
She's not interested in
your love life, Mick.

38:14.917 --> 38:16.542
(sighs)

38:16.625 --> 38:17.542
Where was I?

38:17.625 --> 38:18.583
(deeply inhales)

38:18.667 --> 38:21.542
You let Sully know
you were in L.A.

38:21.625 --> 38:23.875
(sighs):
Right.

38:23.959 --> 38:25.500
Uh...

38:25.583 --> 38:27.792
I sent word
back to Sully...

38:27.875 --> 38:28.875
through channels.

38:28.959 --> 38:30.875
I told him about the sunshine
they got out here.

38:30.959 --> 38:32.875
About the girls
with the suntans,

38:32.959 --> 38:34.208
the fake tits...

38:34.291 --> 38:35.667
Uh, how about we skip
the travelogue, huh?

38:35.750 --> 38:37.333
Why are you
breaking my balls?!

38:37.417 --> 38:38.625
Stick to the facts.

38:38.709 --> 38:39.875
The plan for Sully,

38:39.959 --> 38:40.625
to get him
out of the country.

38:41.917 --> 38:43.500
Sure...

38:47.083 --> 38:48.667
I let it slip that

38:48.750 --> 38:49.667
I could arrange it.

38:49.750 --> 38:50.709
And sure as shit,
Sully bit.

38:50.792 --> 38:53.458
He was a mean motherfucker,
but not so bright.

38:53.542 --> 38:54.542
I arranged
the whole thing.

38:54.625 --> 38:55.625
COCHRAN:
Completely under

38:55.709 --> 38:56.917
the supervision
of the FBI, you understand.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.750
Where did Sully think
he was going?

39:03.250 --> 39:05.000
Maldives.

39:11.709 --> 39:14.041
The night it's all set,

39:14.125 --> 39:16.709
I go down to the
dock and I wait.

39:16.792 --> 39:19.917
Just standing there
like a rabbit in an open field.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.333
Sully shows.

39:21.417 --> 39:23.333
I lead him toward the boat...

39:23.417 --> 39:24.583
Where Special
Agent Barnes

39:24.667 --> 39:26.500
was waiting, like we'd planned.

39:26.583 --> 39:28.208
Why didn't he just arrest Sully
instead of shooting him?

39:28.291 --> 39:31.250
MICKEY:
Sully fired first.

39:31.333 --> 39:32.750
He knew it was a trap.

39:32.834 --> 39:33.542
He could smell a Fed
from a mile away.

39:33.625 --> 39:34.375
Special Agent Barnes
took down

39:34.458 --> 39:37.333
Sully and saved
Mr. Donovan's life.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.959
If you ask me,

39:39.041 --> 39:41.583
they were a little reckless
with my welfare.

39:41.667 --> 39:44.834
So you're the hero
behind the hero?

39:44.917 --> 39:46.291
You have no idea.

39:48.208 --> 39:51.792
If you're all working together,

39:51.875 --> 39:54.625
why did your father offer
to sell me his story?

39:56.375 --> 39:58.166
(laughs)

39:58.250 --> 40:00.166
He's an ex-con from Southie.

40:00.250 --> 40:02.458
Used to rob banks
for a living.

40:02.542 --> 40:03.834
We all have our shortcomings.

40:03.917 --> 40:05.959
I'm not opposed

40:06.041 --> 40:08.458
to making a few
bucks on the side

40:08.542 --> 40:09.500
if I can.

40:09.583 --> 40:10.458
I'm sorry.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.959
It was a...
it was a mistake.

40:14.041 --> 40:17.625
So, I'm the only journalist
who knows about this?

40:17.709 --> 40:19.041
Yeah.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.750
And I suppose you don't want me

40:20.834 --> 40:22.667
to use Mr. Donovan's name.

40:22.750 --> 40:23.792
That's right.

40:23.875 --> 40:24.959
Wait a minute.

40:25.041 --> 40:26.750
I risked my life!
I don't even get credit?

40:26.834 --> 40:28.166
She uses your name,

40:28.250 --> 40:30.625
every snake in Sully's gang

40:30.709 --> 40:31.583
who's still alive's gonna
come after you.

40:31.667 --> 40:33.333
We don't want that to
happen, Pop, do we?

40:33.417 --> 40:36.041
Want to keep you
nice and safe.

40:37.417 --> 40:38.166
Thank you, son.

40:38.250 --> 40:40.291
Means a lot to me.

40:40.375 --> 40:41.583
I think we're done here.

40:41.667 --> 40:44.542
What about Sully's girlfriend?
Do you know where she is?

40:44.625 --> 40:46.166
We're not gonna allow
Mr. Donovan to answer
that ques...

40:46.250 --> 40:47.458
She's in
witness protection.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.083
Hey.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.041
Where's Mom?

41:02.125 --> 41:04.250
Taking a shower.

41:05.291 --> 41:07.875
Did you apologize to Alex?

41:07.959 --> 41:09.125
No.

41:09.208 --> 41:11.625
His father called me a dick,
and Dad made us leave.

41:20.709 --> 41:23.709
Are you high?

41:23.792 --> 41:25.083
No.

41:25.166 --> 41:26.792
You're stoned!

41:26.875 --> 41:27.875
I am not!

41:27.959 --> 41:29.125
You better get
yourself straight

41:29.208 --> 41:30.125
before Dad comes home
and kicks your ass.

41:30.208 --> 41:34.083
What's in your ear?

41:34.166 --> 41:35.750
It's a diamond, you asshole.

41:35.834 --> 41:37.834
Looks totally stupid.

41:39.208 --> 41:41.625
KATE (in other room):
Bob?

41:41.709 --> 41:43.125
Yeah, I got what I needed.

41:43.208 --> 41:44.750
RAY:
Help yourself.

41:44.834 --> 41:46.333
KATE:
I'm taking the redeye tonight.

41:46.417 --> 41:48.667
You got yourself
a sweet piece.

41:48.750 --> 41:49.917
You don't know what
you're talking about.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.083
Don't I?

41:52.166 --> 41:54.208
I know Cochran's gonna be
a big cheese in Washington.

41:54.291 --> 41:56.291
And you and Ezra,
the two of you live in luxury.

41:56.375 --> 41:58.583
And what do I got? Nothing.

41:58.667 --> 41:59.917
I want to see my grandkids, Ray.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.041
We'll see.

42:02.125 --> 42:03.542
Can't you even do me one simple

42:03.625 --> 42:06.041
act of kindness?
I'm still your father.

42:06.125 --> 42:06.750
What's in me is in you.

42:06.834 --> 42:08.583
Nothing will ever
change that.

42:11.333 --> 42:14.250
Come on, I'm dropping you off.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.125
(phone chimes)

42:30.500 --> 42:31.750
(whooshes)

42:44.041 --> 42:46.166
(whooshes)

42:49.000 --> 42:52.166
(sniffs)

42:52.250 --> 42:54.375
(phone chimes)

43:01.208 --> 43:03.291
(laughs softly)

43:15.333 --> 43:17.625
(camera clicks)

43:19.542 --> 43:22.125
(laughs)

43:22.208 --> 43:24.166
(whooshes)

43:51.750 --> 43:54.709
RAY: Your first book
was about priests?

43:54.792 --> 43:55.875
Pedophile priests.

43:58.500 --> 44:00.875
What you write about them for?

44:04.458 --> 44:06.875
I don't know.

44:06.959 --> 44:08.166
At first, I thought I wanted
to help the victims.

44:08.250 --> 44:11.083
But it turns out,

44:11.166 --> 44:13.041
I just like
talking to sociopaths.

44:15.166 --> 44:16.834
They fascinate me.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.333
Did you read my book?

44:20.417 --> 44:23.083
No.

44:23.166 --> 44:24.208
Why not?

44:24.291 --> 44:27.166
Aren't you Catholic?

44:27.250 --> 44:28.792
Not anymore.

44:32.500 --> 44:35.166
Can I ask you something?

44:36.542 --> 44:37.750
Sure.

44:37.834 --> 44:39.959
Do you love your wife?

44:40.041 --> 44:41.875
Yeah.

44:44.375 --> 44:45.959
Anything else?

44:46.041 --> 44:48.000
Do you have any friends?

44:50.166 --> 44:52.583
You met Avi.

44:52.667 --> 44:55.083
He works for you.

44:55.166 --> 44:56.625
That doesn't count.

44:56.709 --> 45:00.125
I have trust issues.

45:00.208 --> 45:01.375
You think?

45:01.458 --> 45:03.542
(laughs)

45:07.166 --> 45:10.333
Me, too.

45:33.375 --> 45:34.834
I'm gonna miss you.

46:03.083 --> 46:05.500
SPORTSCASTER (on TV):
Boys in blue
are on a two-game skid

46:05.583 --> 46:08.625
heading into this evening's
showdown with Arizona...

46:08.709 --> 46:11.208
I deserve better than this!

46:11.291 --> 46:14.041
What?

46:15.333 --> 46:18.125
Nothing.

46:18.208 --> 46:21.000
You really think
it was the Vatican?

46:21.083 --> 46:23.458
Huh?

46:23.542 --> 46:25.166
That took you.

46:30.542 --> 46:32.625
I don't know.

46:32.709 --> 46:34.500
Do I have to keep
the door open?

46:34.583 --> 46:37.542
I'd like some privacy.

46:37.625 --> 46:40.417
Just for tonight.

46:40.500 --> 46:44.041
(sighs) Okay.

COCHRAN:
Is she gone?

47:40.500 --> 47:41.667
Yeah.

47:41.750 --> 47:43.917
Good work today. I'm impressed.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.375
Would've handled things a little
bit differently, but, uh...

47:46.458 --> 47:47.083
Like you handled Tiny?

47:47.166 --> 47:50.250
Oh, come on now, Ray. Let it go.

47:50.333 --> 47:52.125
You can't spend
your life nursing grudges.

47:59.792 --> 48:02.041
You look so handsome.
