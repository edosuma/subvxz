00:04.272 --> 00:07.075
[theme music]

00:08.642 --> 00:09.577
I'm gonna be 12.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.412
I don't want any
more babysitters.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.214
Becky and Darlene
were allowed to stay

00:13.247 --> 00:15.316
alone when they were my age.

00:15.349 --> 00:19.087
Well, that's because girls
mature faster than boys.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.222
So when do boys get mature?

00:21.255 --> 00:25.025
We'll let you know as
soon as your dad gets there.

00:25.059 --> 00:29.730
I heard that, and I
choose to respond thusly.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.566
[armpit noises]

00:34.635 --> 00:36.870
- Mom lied to me.
- Well, you're lucky, Deej.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.272
There are kids in
China whose mothers

00:38.306 --> 00:41.775
have no lies to give them.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.845
Mom says boys aren't
as mature as girls.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.180
Dammit, Roseanne.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.416
The boy keeps hearing all
this negative stuff about men,

00:48.449 --> 00:49.583
and it's just not true.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.386
He's every bit as mature
as the girls ever were.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.955
Well, your son wants to
stay home all by himself.

00:54.988 --> 00:55.856
No way!

00:55.889 --> 00:56.757
He's a boy.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.526
[phone ringing]

00:58.559 --> 00:59.760
I'm gonna get a lawyer.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.096
Kids can divorce their
parents for stuff like this.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.431
Oh, yeah?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.433
Well, you know that little
boy that divorced his parents?

01:05.466 --> 01:07.268
You know what he's doing now?

01:07.301 --> 01:09.770
Every night, he goes out
cruising the bars looking

01:09.803 --> 01:12.540
for new parents, and I
can't tell you the kind

01:12.573 --> 01:16.144
of garbage that's out there.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.112
DJ, run upstairs for a minute.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.913
I'm not done
talking about this.

01:19.947 --> 01:20.814
Go upstairs.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.049
I'm not finished!

01:22.082 --> 01:23.284
What's going on?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.185
It's Joan.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.219
She's calling about your dad.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.120
What happened?

01:26.154 --> 01:27.688
You never listen to me!

01:27.721 --> 01:28.922
DJ, get upstairs now!

01:32.926 --> 01:33.727
He died, honey.

01:40.468 --> 01:43.371
[music playing]

01:48.442 --> 01:51.845
[theme music]

02:35.856 --> 02:38.125
Uh, yeah, I'm here.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.893
It's Harris.

02:39.927 --> 02:40.794
Al Harris.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.396
He's my dad.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.031
Look, I just got through
telling this whole thing

02:44.064 --> 02:46.166
to somebody else.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.703
Well, all I want to know is if
his fight's coming in on time.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.672
No, not coach.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.275
Try baggage.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.477
Ask them about his
frequent flyer miles.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.411
He was a salesman.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.050
It would have been
very important to him.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.787
Jackie, can't you go and
get drunk or something?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.422
Yeah, I'm here.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.491
Listen, this is going to sound
kind of weird and everything,

03:10.524 --> 03:12.626
but is he going to be
coming down that conveyor

03:12.660 --> 03:13.527
belt with everybody's baggage?

03:17.965 --> 03:18.832
No.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.703
No, the mortuary picks him up.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.439
Oh, that's good
because I didn't think

03:25.473 --> 03:29.310
we could fit him in our truck.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.612
Well, I'm sorry you
don't think that's funny.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.581
Hey, I'm saving my best
jokes for the funeral.

03:36.049 --> 03:36.884
That's it.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.018
I'm not making any more calls.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.420
You do the rest of
the family list.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.556
I can't call people, Roseanne.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.391
Jackie, dial.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.795
I'm supposed to
be in mourning.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.063
Well, then wear a veil over
your face while you do it.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.406
Can't-- Auntie Barbara?

03:58.439 --> 04:00.007
It's Jackie.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.642
Jackie.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.243
I'm fine.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.245
Fine.

04:05.279 --> 04:08.048
I'm fine.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.717
I have some bad news.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.354
Dad is not with us anymore.

04:13.387 --> 04:17.558
I said, Dad has passed away.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.661
He's passed away.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.663
Dad is gone.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.633
Dad's dead.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.601
He's dead!

04:27.635 --> 04:30.604
No, dead!

04:30.638 --> 04:33.073
Dad!

04:33.106 --> 04:34.074
He's fine.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.544
He sends his love.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.545
Bye.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.012
I am not doing that again.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.483
You can't make me.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.417
BEVERLY: Hello, girls.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.988
Where have you been?

04:48.021 --> 04:49.423
Hi, Mom.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.958
Everybody doing OK?

04:50.991 --> 04:52.025
Yeah, we're doing fine.

04:52.059 --> 04:52.926
How are you doing?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.562
Oh, I'm not sure.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.598
You dream about this
moment, and then it happens.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.633
Then it's just not the same.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.535
Jackie, honey, you
look exhausted.

05:01.569 --> 05:05.906
Well, I had to talk
to Auntie Barbara.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.108
I think we should
all have some tea

05:08.141 --> 05:12.980
and then pour large
amounts of brandy into it.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.515
Darlene, will you
put on some water

05:14.548 --> 05:19.587
and then bring the brandy
down from your room?

05:19.620 --> 05:20.688
Very funny.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.089
Don't you think if I
had brandy in my room,

05:22.122 --> 05:25.626
I'd spend more time at home?

05:25.659 --> 05:28.295
So, did Joan
have more details?

05:28.328 --> 05:31.532
Or was she rushing out to
break up another marriage?

05:31.565 --> 05:34.402
He was on the road and
he had a heart attack.

05:34.435 --> 05:40.273
If there's any more, she'll
tell us at the funeral.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.342
At the funeral?

05:42.376 --> 05:43.310
She wants to be there.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.978
We can't stop her.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.749
Perhaps she and I can draw
straws over who gets to throw

05:48.782 --> 05:49.750
themself on the coffin.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.821
Well, if she gets
out of line, we'll

05:53.854 --> 05:57.825
drag her behind the chapel, and
we'll beat the crap out of her.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.193
Mom, are we out of tea bags?

06:00.227 --> 06:01.929
I think I put them
in the cupboard.

06:04.998 --> 06:10.971
You know, for such a rotten kid,
you're sure being a big help.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.840
I think I put away
most of the grief buffet.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.111
It's so bizarre how
people bring over all

06:18.145 --> 06:19.980
this food when someone dies.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.115
Yeah, like it's going to
make you feel any better.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.050
Hey, chocolate cake!

06:23.083 --> 06:23.884
When did that get here?

06:29.690 --> 06:33.594
Well, um, everything's
all crazy around her,

06:33.627 --> 06:37.431
and we haven't even had a
chance to talk or anything.

06:37.465 --> 06:40.000
Are you OK?

06:40.033 --> 06:43.303
Well, I feel bad that
I don't feel bad enough.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.539
I mean, I haven't
seen him in a while.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.875
I don't know.
It's weird.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.945
Well, you don't got to feel
nothing but what you feel.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.180
I just feel like I should cry.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.483
I haven't cried yet.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.316
That's OK.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.590
I've got cramps, though.

07:02.623 --> 07:07.294
Well, I think he
would've liked that.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.163
[music playing]

07:13.634 --> 07:16.203
Grandma, I'm really
sorry Grandpa died.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.404
I'm going to miss him.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.539
That's sweet, dear.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.174
Your grandfather loved
you too, and he's going

07:21.208 --> 07:25.145
to look very smart in this tie.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.080
This is for Grandpa?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.215
Absolutely.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.718
You're wearing the very
tie that will be buried

07:30.751 --> 07:33.186
with your grandfather tomorrow.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.154
Get it off me!

07:34.187 --> 07:35.088
Get it off!

07:40.561 --> 07:41.695
Darlene, would you let--

07:41.729 --> 07:42.530
No.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.234
Hey, Mom, wouldn't
it just be easier

07:47.267 --> 07:51.438
if you pealed your face off and
chased them around the block?

07:51.471 --> 07:54.174
Roseanne, I have
to tie this straight.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.376
You can't trust
those funeral people.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.045
They'll just throw
the tie on him.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.313
It has to be right.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.815
His tie will be
perfect, Mother.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.851
I'll make sure of it myself.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.619
The man will not
be buried under six

08:05.653 --> 08:08.622
feet of rocks, dirt, and crap
until his tie is perfect.

08:11.792 --> 08:12.960
Did you find the
picture of Dad yet?

08:12.993 --> 08:13.961
I can't decide.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.596
Well, you got
to hurry, Jackie,

08:15.629 --> 08:17.064
because the mortician
needs to see it

08:17.097 --> 08:19.099
so he can figure out what
Dad's supposed to look like.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.868
How about that one?

08:20.901 --> 08:24.004
That's his Navy
picture from 1944.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.406
Well, he looked so handsome.

08:26.439 --> 08:27.575
Yeah, well, I
think they're going

08:27.608 --> 08:29.342
to have a little bit of
trouble trying to sew

08:29.376 --> 08:30.443
his hand to his forehead.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.948
I can't take this anymore.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.483
My stomach hurts.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.985
OK, well, you don't
have to take it anymore

08:38.018 --> 08:39.486
because you can just
be the designated

08:39.519 --> 08:42.690
basket case this time, OK?

08:42.723 --> 08:44.257
OK.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.794
I love you, Roseanne.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.028
I love you too, weirdo.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.499
Come on.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.234
We got to hurry now because I
want to be back here by 3:00.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.569
How come?

08:55.603 --> 08:57.871
Well, because Joan
is getting in early

08:57.905 --> 09:02.576
and I want to invite
her over to the house.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.077
Well, jeez, Roseanne.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.179
Don't you think
that's a little odd,

09:06.213 --> 09:08.949
inviting Dad's other
woman over to your house?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.551
Well, hey, like it or not,
she's been part of his life

09:11.585 --> 09:13.153
for 22 years.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.655
Just seems like the
thing to do now.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.289
Well, fine.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.693
That's-- that's-- that's great.

09:19.727 --> 09:20.994
What, Jackie?

09:21.028 --> 09:23.530
JACKIE: Well, if you're so
comfortable with this woman

09:23.563 --> 09:25.432
in your house, it might
have been nice to invite

09:25.465 --> 09:27.601
them over when Dad was alive.

09:27.635 --> 09:31.404
Yeah, but then Dad
would've came with her.

09:31.438 --> 09:35.776
This way, I'm pretty sure
he ain't going to show.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.144
I'm just saying that I--

09:37.177 --> 09:40.380
I didn't get to see my father
for the last years of his life

09:40.413 --> 09:42.315
because of you, and now
here you are playing

09:42.349 --> 09:44.785
hostess to his mistress.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.387
You're not going to blame
me for you not seeing Dad.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.556
You made him so
unwelcome here,

09:49.589 --> 09:51.725
he never would have come visit.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.894
Just because you hated him, then
the whole rest of the family

09:53.927 --> 09:54.862
had to hate him too.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.863
You are so wrong.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.932
You are so selfish.

09:58.966 --> 09:59.833
Oh.

09:59.867 --> 10:00.901
Oh, I'm selfish.

10:00.934 --> 10:01.869
Right.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.036
Have you noticed
who's been doing all

10:03.070 --> 10:04.471
the planning for this funeral?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.606
Did you notice at all
that is wasn't you?

10:06.640 --> 10:09.076
That's because you don't
care, so it was no problem

10:09.109 --> 10:10.177
for you to handle everything.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.212
I loved him.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.981
Well, when did you
love him more, Jackie?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.548
When he'd come home and
beat us with the belt

10:15.582 --> 10:17.250
or when he didn't
come home at all?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.886
That was a long
time ago, Roseanne.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.688
You don't know what was
going on in his mind

10:20.721 --> 10:21.855
the last years of his life.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.961
You didn't even give him a
chance to say he was sorry.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.263
Well, you love him so
much, I'll tell you what.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.165
You go down to that funeral
home and you make the rest

10:32.199 --> 10:33.300
of the arrangements, OK?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.368
I'm selfish, and I don't
care, so I wash my hands

10:35.402 --> 10:36.269
of the whole damn thing.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.337
All right, fine.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.706
I will make the rest
of the arrangements.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.313
You're calling Auntie
Barbara with directions

10:46.346 --> 10:49.516
to the cemetery,
right, Roseanne?

10:49.549 --> 10:50.350
Roseanne!

10:55.756 --> 10:58.625
[music playing]

10:58.658 --> 10:59.592
DAN: Come on, Jacks.

10:59.626 --> 11:00.694
I'm here for you.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.362
Why do I have to
pick out a casket now

11:02.395 --> 11:03.596
when my Dad just died?

11:06.233 --> 11:07.400
It kind of happens
that way, Jackie.

11:11.705 --> 11:12.572
Hello.

11:12.605 --> 11:13.606
I'm Frank Benders.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.709
You-- you must be Roseanne.

11:15.743 --> 11:16.609
No, I am Jackie.

11:16.643 --> 11:17.911
I'm Roseanne's sister.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.780
I am going to make
the arrangements.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.581
How was that?

11:21.614 --> 11:22.482
Dan Connor.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.484
Nice to meet you.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.353
Look, we're not very good
at this sort of thing,

11:26.386 --> 11:27.721
so could we just sit
down and get through

11:27.755 --> 11:28.621
it as quickly as possible?

11:28.655 --> 11:29.757
Oh, certainly.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.459
I want to make this as
easy on you as possible.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.961
Would you like to see the body?

11:33.994 --> 11:36.363
Oh, God.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.697
I think no on that one.

11:37.731 --> 11:40.133
Thank you very much.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.268
I understand.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.137
He called Dad "the body."

11:44.171 --> 11:45.305
Jackie, you want
me to do this?

11:45.338 --> 11:46.506
No.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.175
I-- I said I was going
to make the arrangements,

11:48.208 --> 11:49.877
so let's start arranging.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.211
All right.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.446
Well, first off, we should
probably pick out the casket.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.595
They're all nice.

12:08.628 --> 12:09.429
Very nice.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.267
I like the white one.

12:14.301 --> 12:17.237
That is a lovely choice.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.505
Roseanne would
never pick white.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.007
She says it gets dirty too fast.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.947
I don't think that really
applies here, Jackie.

12:26.980 --> 12:27.781
She'd want the black.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.786
I'll take the white.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.121
White it is.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.823
JACKIE: And I would like one
of those satin pillows too.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.325
She'd hate that.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.794
Maybe we should ask
what this costs, Jackie.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.295
Well, since your
mother and father

12:42.329 --> 12:44.064
already bought their
adjoining plots,

12:44.097 --> 12:46.533
it shouldn't be that expensive.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.335
How much is not expensive?

12:48.368 --> 12:49.369
Well, let's see.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.770
The White Rose--

12:50.804 --> 12:53.706
Oh, the White Rose.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.743
$3,000.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.644
I guess that's a lot.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.312
That's a lot, isn't it, Dan?

12:59.346 --> 13:01.081
Yes, that is a lot.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.816
Maybe I should
look at some other.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.452
Oh, of course, but you
should realize that they

13:05.485 --> 13:08.388
are of lesser quality.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.558
So what you're saying is
that if she really loved him,

13:11.591 --> 13:13.460
she'd get the White Rose.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.996
And if she doesn't,
she'd get something

13:16.029 --> 13:17.764
with a twist tie and the
word "Hefty" on the side.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.006
No.

13:26.039 --> 13:26.874
No.

13:26.907 --> 13:27.807
No.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.376
I'm sorry.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.012
If cost is a consideration,
I'm sure that we

13:32.045 --> 13:35.348
can find something that you
can be comfortable with.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.816
JACKIE: Before we
go on, I just want

13:36.850 --> 13:39.887
you to know that I'm feeling
very irrational right now.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.389
I'm likely to buy
anything that you show me.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.125
And I'm also very
likely to take out a gun

13:45.158 --> 13:47.094
and blow your head
off if I think

13:47.127 --> 13:51.764
you're taking
advantage of me, so I

13:51.798 --> 13:56.403
would play me very carefully.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.838
That girl.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.674
[music playing]

14:06.513 --> 14:07.314
Roseanne?

14:09.649 --> 14:10.517
Hi, Joan.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.153
I'm glad you could come down.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.222
Well, thanks
for asking me out.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.824
I understand about not
coming to the house.

14:17.857 --> 14:22.295
Yeah, well, it looks
pretty much like this place.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.664
Let me order a
beer or something.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.799
Could I get you a second?

14:26.833 --> 14:31.538
Well, you could if you would
have gotten here an hour ago.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.640
I'll have what she's having.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.576
My pleasure.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.679
Wow, this is so weird,
sitting here drinking a beer

14:39.712 --> 14:42.482
with my dead father's mistress.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.416
It's funny.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.352
I'm not a mistress
in Kansas City.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.887
I'm only a mistress in Lanford.

14:47.921 --> 14:48.821
Oh, no, no, no.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.559
In Lanford, you're
something else.

14:52.592 --> 14:53.693
Really?

14:53.726 --> 14:57.564
I don't think you asked
me here to insult me.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.565
No, I didn't.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.133
I'm sorry.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.736
Uh, listen, what I
did I ask you here

15:03.770 --> 15:08.008
for is because I want to ask
you some stuff about my dad,

15:08.041 --> 15:09.376
you know?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.678
You're kind of the only person
that's really been with him

15:11.711 --> 15:14.147
for the last couple of years.

15:14.181 --> 15:19.086
I just wanted to know if there's
any time where he said anything

15:19.119 --> 15:21.754
about any mistakes
he might've made

15:21.788 --> 15:26.093
or, uh, any regrets
maybe that he had?

15:26.126 --> 15:27.360
Yeah.

15:27.394 --> 15:30.263
He really regretted what
happened between him

15:30.297 --> 15:33.133
and you girls.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.667
Oh, he really said that?

15:34.701 --> 15:36.569
Come on, Roseanne.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.539
You must have known
how unhappy he was.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.709
I just thought he
didn't give a damn.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.012
Didn't give a damn?

15:45.045 --> 15:48.015
He prided himself on what
a devoted father he was.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.955
You've got to be kidding me.

15:55.989 --> 15:59.059
He always said you girls never
appreciated what he did for you

15:59.092 --> 16:03.263
because he spoiled you so much.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.599
Well, if he meant
spoiled as in wreck--

16:06.633 --> 16:10.303
Roseanne, I know you're
upset with your father

16:10.337 --> 16:11.871
for having an affair.

16:11.904 --> 16:15.008
You think this is
about the affair?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.943
You don't know nothing.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.112
You don't know nothing
about my childhood.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.114
I could tell you
stuff about my dad

16:21.148 --> 16:23.916
that you couldn't even handle.

16:23.950 --> 16:28.455
Look, we shouldn't
be doing this.

16:28.488 --> 16:34.827
In spite of everything, your dad
did die knowing you loved him.

16:34.861 --> 16:35.662
I got to go.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.003
[music playing]

16:56.849 --> 16:58.285
Hello.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.019
I guess I'm a little early.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.288
I'm Beverly Harris.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.157
I know.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.226
You must be Joan.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.127
Yes.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.762
We finally meet.

17:09.796 --> 17:13.066
What a shame we don't have
some sort of flavored coffee

17:13.100 --> 17:15.368
to celebrate this
moment in our life.

17:20.973 --> 17:24.377
I understand how
you feel about me.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.913
Do you?

17:26.946 --> 17:28.948
Well, I think I'd
better go inside.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.717
BEVERLY: Not yet.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.985
I've waited a long
time for this moment,

17:33.019 --> 17:36.022
and you will not rob me of it.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.824
All right.
Go ahead.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.759
I think you should be shot.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.561
I long for the
days when we could

17:41.594 --> 17:44.231
brand someone like you
with a scarlet letter,

17:44.264 --> 17:48.000
leaving you a lonely,
miserable outcast.

17:48.034 --> 17:51.638
And if you ever contract an
incurable and very painful

17:51.671 --> 17:54.241
disease, I will not
be able to stop myself

17:54.274 --> 17:56.343
from dancing a jig of glee.

18:01.314 --> 18:04.083
Now, that being
said, I would like

18:04.117 --> 18:06.953
to sell you my burial plot.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.521
Are you serious?

18:08.555 --> 18:13.760
You love him so much, you
spend eternity next to the man.

18:13.793 --> 18:14.727
- Mom.
- Hello, dear.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.131
We're chatting.
Go away.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.799
Mom, do I have to
remind you we can

18:19.832 --> 18:23.570
only afford one coffin today?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.638
If I could just
have one moment.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.807
Before we close the
casket, I'm going to need

18:27.840 --> 18:31.411
someone to identify the body.
- I'll do it.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.246
OK, I think that's fair
because I got to pick

18:33.280 --> 18:36.115
the pillow and everything.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.584
Rosie, you want
me to go in there?

18:37.617 --> 18:38.985
No, I'm going to do it.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.187
Right this way, Mrs. Connor.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.828
Just a quick look, and
then I'll close it.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.064
Fine.

18:52.098 --> 18:52.899
That's all I need.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.606
Can I have a minute
in here by myself?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.374
Of course.
Take your time.

19:14.053 --> 19:17.990
Uh, Dad, I'm real sorry
that you died before I

19:18.024 --> 19:19.226
got to tell you some stuff.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.199
OK.

19:34.307 --> 19:38.245
I'm angry at you for
lying to me my whole life.

19:38.278 --> 19:43.082
I'm angry that I didn't ever
know who you really were.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.385
I'm mad that when I was
a kid, you ignored me,

19:45.418 --> 19:46.686
and when you did give
me any attention,

19:46.719 --> 19:49.689
it was usually violent.

19:49.722 --> 19:53.960
I'm mad that you left us
alone with a crazy mother.

19:53.993 --> 19:57.597
I'm mad that because of you
I grew up distrustful of men,

19:57.630 --> 20:00.032
and I couldn't even trust my
own husband for the first five

20:00.066 --> 20:03.035
years we were married.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.872
I'm mad at you because you did
all the same stuff to Jackie

20:05.905 --> 20:08.441
and because you made us feel
like we were never good enough.

20:12.044 --> 20:16.516
But now, I just need it to end.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.852
So Dad, I'm forgiving
you just because I need

20:19.886 --> 20:23.222
to move on with my
life, and I forgive

20:23.256 --> 20:24.791
myself for being so damn angry.

20:38.471 --> 20:41.808
[music playing]

20:48.348 --> 20:51.050
Thank you for your humor.

20:51.083 --> 20:51.951
I love you.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.653
Goodbye.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.989
[music playing]

21:04.397 --> 21:05.998
What do you want to do now?

21:06.032 --> 21:10.803
Mm, just sit out
here for a while.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.171
Wanna eat another casserole?

21:14.607 --> 21:15.408
Nope.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.512
It's kind of cool
sitting out here anyway,

21:19.546 --> 21:23.916
you know, looking at the stars,
listening to all the quiet.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.621
You know, it gives you
time to think about stuff.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.163
Wanna watch TV?

21:37.196 --> 21:38.064
God, yes.

21:38.097 --> 21:40.367
What's on?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.402
9:30.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.505
Oh, hey, it's time
for my favorite show!

21:45.538 --> 21:46.706
What?

21:46.739 --> 21:50.943
You know, that guy, that,
uh, Shecky Thomas guy?
