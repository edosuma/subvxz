01:40.733 --> 01:42.634
Dear Joshua.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.805
I know it's been nearly six
years since you heard from me.

01:48.508 --> 01:51.143
I can't believe you're
already in tenth grade.

01:51.678 --> 01:55.547
It's like time has
flown by and stood still

01:55.549 --> 01:57.149
all at the same time.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.752
It's usually a father's hope
that his son will follow

02:00.754 --> 02:05.190
in his footsteps. Thankfully,
that won't be the case with us.

02:06.593 --> 02:08.759
I never meant to
hurt you, Josh...

02:08.762 --> 02:12.331
But I have failed you
in every way possible.

02:14.834 --> 02:19.238
My intention with this letter is
to properly say good-bye to you.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.842
Why it's taken me so
long, I don't know.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.712
Maybe I'm a coward after all.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.616
Make your mark in
this world, son.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.318
Always be your mom's protector.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.555
And no matter what
you hear about me,

02:36.557 --> 02:39.658
you keep moving forward...
And never look back.

02:42.295 --> 02:43.896
Your father.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.203
Ooh, that
motherfucker hung himself, bro!

03:24.205 --> 03:26.405
Hell no, that
buster got deal with, homey!

03:26.773 --> 03:28.207
What happened, Lopez?

03:28.209 --> 03:30.375
Homey had issues, sir.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.612
-Suicide, my ass.
Stick Lopez in the hole.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.981
Photograph everything
before you take him down.

03:36.683 --> 03:37.616
No, wait.

03:39.485 --> 03:41.353
Don't do anything yet.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.456
Code four.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.630
Looks like two of you will be
leaving the block today, money.

03:52.432 --> 03:53.699
Let me get you outta here.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.001
This fucking mess
will take all day.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.911
Your gate money,
200, and your cdcr ID.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.380
Use it until you get
a new driver's license.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.954
The Van outside will take
you to the train station.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.259
Just take it one day
at a time, money.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.361
From the beast.

05:45.778 --> 05:47.379
What's up, wood?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.916
Man, good to see you, brother.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.052
Welcome.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.654
That's for you, man.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.923
Picked that out myself.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.624
Something in there just
to get you started.

05:59.626 --> 05:59.624
-Appreciate it.

05:59.626 --> 06:02.728
-Got a big night
planned for you, bro.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.831
Youngster ride there,
that's Howie.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.566
He's the man with the plan.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.536
-Should give you the
welcome home party.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.638
-Told you he'd
know who you were.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.674
Youngster's all star
struck and shit.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.409
Hey, he's a sniper though, man.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.111
Did work over there
in Afghanistan.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.747
Only job you got now
is staying clean.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.749
Roger that.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.418
Fuck, let's go eat,
man. Whatever you want is on me.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.719
Need a room, too.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.122
-Of course. Time to lose
those parole duds, right?

06:30.124 --> 06:32.491
Get you a whole new getup.
I got you, bro.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.874
Ed kutcher, parole.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.542
I got a tip
this sex offender has a

06:50.544 --> 06:52.511
14-year-old girl in his place.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.045
Waiting on the
damn warrant, though.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.747
-No worries,
Lenny's one of my cases

06:55.749 --> 06:57.115
so I'm your warrant.
-Good.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.604
Kutcher.
Come to the door, Lenny.

07:22.975 --> 07:24.609
Lenny, it's kutcher.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.844
Come to the door.
You know the drill.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.065
Drop it!

07:47.067 --> 07:50.001
Go, go! Shit!
10-3, shots fired!

07:50.003 --> 07:52.103
Repeat, shots fired!

08:05.852 --> 08:07.552
What's up, chop?

08:09.121 --> 08:10.822
What the hell, chopper?

08:12.758 --> 08:14.025
It's been a minute, huh?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.494
Welcome home, brother.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.496
-Jason horvath.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.763
It's an honor.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.766
How about the name chef, huh?
Name mean anything to you?

08:21.768 --> 08:23.835
Hell, every tweaker south
of folsom knows that name.

08:23.837 --> 08:28.073
Any one of these bitches in
here, they're all fucking

08:28.075 --> 08:31.676
dirt legs, dude. I'm telling
you, man. Every single one

08:31.678 --> 08:33.945
of them, man, they're fucking
cheerleaders, brother.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.214
You can literally do whatever
the fuck you want to them.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.683
You want a drink? Smoke?
I got you, brother.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.553
-He looks good, don't he?

08:41.554 --> 08:42.821
-He looks good.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.094
Hey,
you looking for a bathroom?

08:49.962 --> 08:51.296
Come on, I'll show
you one more private.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.735
Put your clothes on.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.674
I could just get you
one of the other girls,

09:35.676 --> 09:37.242
if you just tell me
which one you like.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.614
What's your name?

09:43.316 --> 09:45.016
Janie.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.652
How about you and me get
a drink sometime, Janie?

09:48.120 --> 09:49.754
Just not tonight.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.090
Howie and shotgun
have my number, or--

09:52.092 --> 09:53.325
i-I'll get it from them.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.131
I need a ride.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.733
Sure, money.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.934
Everything okay?

10:02.936 --> 10:03.802
Down!

10:07.907 --> 10:08.974
Who's down?

10:12.144 --> 10:13.645
Janie!

10:14.647 --> 10:16.715
No, Janie. No! No!

10:20.987 --> 10:22.120
No!

10:22.122 --> 10:25.190
Hey, hey, hey!
Money, we gotta go!

10:25.192 --> 10:26.992
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

10:31.163 --> 10:33.131
You ain't inked. Get him outta
here in case we're stopped.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.299
Come on!

10:34.967 --> 10:36.801
Go, go, go. Come on, move.

10:42.708 --> 10:43.975
Fuck!

10:45.144 --> 10:46.811
This ride clean?

10:46.813 --> 10:49.748
Insurance is up to
date, reg, everything.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.050
I need it tonight.
Tell me where to drop you off.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.352
I'll pull over here.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.354
Catch the bus.

11:02.028 --> 11:03.695
-They said you're not inked.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.064
Nothing.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.833
You answer only to me now.
You don't go near anyone,

11:08.835 --> 11:11.302
especially if they're validated,
unless I authorize it.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.337
You got it.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.810
Get two prepaid cells,
both of them different.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.046
Then be at my motel at 10 A.M.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.414
-Copy that.

12:18.270 --> 12:19.471
Charge. No basket.

12:19.473 --> 12:20.839
Charge?
It's a pick-up game.

12:20.841 --> 12:20.839
It's a foul!

12:20.841 --> 12:23.742
You can't take a little bump
'n grind, get off the court.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.243
It's all right.
Let's just play.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.044
Lower the shoulder.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.415
If greenman pulls that
shit again, I'm gonna kick

12:30.417 --> 12:32.117
his pussy citigroup ass.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.252
Yeah?
You bringing a stepladder?

12:35.788 --> 12:37.989
How is this an opportunity
for a short joke right now?

12:37.991 --> 12:40.425
Oh. Hirsch is predicting
Kelly will win if

12:40.427 --> 12:42.060
the dow gets above 10-4.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.161
Yeah, not in this market.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.063
But still, metzger's
a republican.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.464
Let's close him
asap, just in case.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.466
All right.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.101
Let's strategize tonight.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.882
You know the rules, bud.

13:06.418 --> 13:07.986
How was school today?

13:07.988 --> 13:10.255
We made masks
for president's day.

13:10.257 --> 13:10.255
Uh-huh.

13:10.257 --> 13:14.425
I picked Abraham Lincoln.
I also made his hat.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.861
That's so cool.
I can't wait to see it.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.266
Turn the TV back on
when you're done, okay?

13:21.268 --> 13:23.334
Mom upstairs?
- Yeah.

13:34.079 --> 13:35.180
Hey, babe.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.214
Hey.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.989
You know, we got 45
minutes before we pick up

13:44.991 --> 13:46.524
tom and Jennifer.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.528
I just showered, lover.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.564
I know. It's my favorite smell.

13:52.566 --> 13:53.865
Okay.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.600
Okay.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.539
It's not happening, is it?
-No.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.473
No.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.611
Oh, by the way, your
design looks amazing.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.847
Oh, thanks.
Did you see the floor samples?

14:08.849 --> 14:10.048
-Pennies, right?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.616
Finally, the
pennies are gonna fly.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.885
Yeah, but how
long is it gonna take?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.186
-To lay out the pennies?
-Yeah.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.621
It's gonna take
a really long time.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.389
That's why I have to ask
Jennifer for her help.

14:18.391 --> 14:18.389
I'm gonna butter her up tonight.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.159
Does everyone use the
same house for finals?

14:21.161 --> 14:23.328
Yes. Even playing field.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.496
Damn, I wanna live there.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.065
I know, right?

14:29.969 --> 14:30.602
Wait, wait, wait.

14:30.604 --> 14:31.402
What did I do?

14:31.404 --> 14:34.072
It's just-i just gotta--

14:34.074 --> 14:35.540
-i knew it. I felt that coming.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.574
You shouldn't have.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.311
Jennifer, I also want
to let you know that I've

14:40.313 --> 14:41.579
been eating asparagus.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.915
No! No!

14:43.917 --> 14:45.216
That's all I'm going to say.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.386
Can we get another bottle?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.054
You want one more?
Yeah, let's do it.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.456
-This is nice.
This is a good place.

14:51.458 --> 14:51.456
One more?

14:51.458 --> 14:55.360
See, I honestly don't think
that baseball constitutes a

14:55.362 --> 14:57.896
date night.
Like, that's not--

14:57.898 --> 15:01.299
but they're dugout club
seats on the third base line.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.002
-It's romantic,
and they're free.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.137
-What?
-It's free, guys.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.973
Okay, fine, fine, fine.
I will allow that, as long as

15:08.975 --> 15:11.409
it means that Jennifer
and I can pick the next two.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.477
Yes!

15:12.479 --> 15:12.477
-Two? How did you get two?

15:12.479 --> 15:15.446
Okay, we want John Mayer.
We get John Mayer.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.482
John Mayer's not
free in any way.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.350
-You are gonna brown-nose
your way into some

15:19.352 --> 15:20.952
John Mayer tickets.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.320
-Don't look at me.
Look at Jacob.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.389
He's got the best knee
pads in the office.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.490
And well used.

15:26.425 --> 15:26.424
-Guys.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.427
Wait until we close
the metzger account.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.262
We'll see whose butts
are getting kissed, right?

15:31.264 --> 15:32.530
-Yeah, that's right, partner.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.366
Honey, the light!
Watch out!

15:55.120 --> 15:56.321
No!

16:01.727 --> 16:04.662
No! No! Tom!

16:07.633 --> 16:10.368
Baby, no!
-Oh, my god!

16:41.767 --> 16:43.301
(Kutcher] Sit down.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.137
Your foreman called, Tony.
Why'd you miss work?

16:47.039 --> 16:49.040
Especially after I went on
the hook and got you the damn

16:49.042 --> 16:50.408
job in the first place.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.310
Look, I know, okay?

16:53.012 --> 16:53.011
Dante was sick, and my mom--

16:53.013 --> 16:57.248
hey, hey, I don't wanna
hear about any of that.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.617
No excuses.
You said you want a plan b,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.386
instead of wasting
the rest of your life.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.755
Look, it's hard, kutcher.
It's hard for me.

17:03.757 --> 17:06.457
Of course it's hard.
You're a convicted felon.

17:06.459 --> 17:09.060
Own the shit.
Rise above it.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.528
Or I'll bust your ass
right back inside.

17:10.530 --> 17:10.528
Don't think I won't.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.031
Look, I will, I will.
I'll rise above it.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.535
So, how's ed doing?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.503
I don't know if
it's hit him yet.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.739
Yeah, well, he saved that girl.
That's gotta feel pretty good.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.776
Still, three of the best?

17:24.778 --> 17:27.045
-Sorry for keeping
you waiting, Manny.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.212
No worries, bro.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.181
So, how you feeling, man?

17:30.183 --> 17:31.682
I'm good. You?

17:32.751 --> 17:35.153
For the record, everyone I know,
they high-fived after you put

17:35.155 --> 17:37.622
that Jester down. Especially
after that fucker shot you.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.593
You ready to catch
some cockroaches?

17:44.196 --> 17:45.563
Yeah. Bring it.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.500
-According to our ci, the beast
is doing an arms deal with this

17:49.502 --> 17:52.070
Southern Mexican in
the next 48 hours.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.639
He's ordered this guy, Jacob
harlon, goes by the street name

17:54.641 --> 17:55.840
of money, to handle things.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.275
Harlon hit the
streets yesterday.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.709
This harlon validated?

17:58.711 --> 18:00.711
No, but our ci says
he's a sleeper.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.346
The beast, huh?

18:02.348 --> 18:04.282
That dude's been running Cali
for the last 15 years...

18:04.284 --> 18:06.117
All from the fucking hole, too.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.253
You okay, ed?

18:09.788 --> 18:11.389
I'm good. Keep going.

18:12.124 --> 18:13.724
Come on, go.
I got work to do.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.761
All right.
Any specifics on the deal?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.196
Yeah.

18:18.198 --> 18:21.332
A thousand full-auto
ak-47s, and at least

18:21.334 --> 18:24.235
500 glocks smuggled
from Afghanistan

18:24.237 --> 18:26.370
none registered in the U.S.

18:26.372 --> 18:27.672
You alert atf ?

18:27.674 --> 18:30.174
-And let them take our collar?
Hell no.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.709
We're controlling
this one, brother.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.311
I love it.
So, what's the plan?

18:33.313 --> 18:35.346
Harlon faces strike three.
We nail that fucker,

18:35.348 --> 18:36.814
get him to flip
on the beast. Simple.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.783
Whole power structure
comes tumbling down.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.751
All right. I'll start pounding
the streets on the eses,

18:40.753 --> 18:40.751
see if anyone's talking.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.888
I'll set up on harlon.
Meet with him later today.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.423
Let's rock, fellas.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.496
Face directly ahead,
please.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.204
So, what's next?

19:33.206 --> 19:34.639
The arraignment, right?

19:34.641 --> 19:36.807
Yes. And I know
the prosecutor assigned to

19:36.809 --> 19:39.610
your case. This guy's
a hard-charger, Jacob.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.513
He only cares about his stats,
especially on dui manslaughter

19:42.515 --> 19:46.217
cases. He's going for the
maximum sentencing guidelines,

19:46.219 --> 19:49.854
four years plus an additional
three for great bodily injury

19:49.856 --> 19:52.490
enhancement since the other
driver broke his legs.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.692
We're talking about
seven years here, man.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.427
Seven years.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.599
Can we fight it?

20:02.935 --> 20:05.236
Yeah. I mean,
we can go to trial, but...

20:06.638 --> 20:09.774
I gotta be honest, man, the
evidence is pretty overwhelming.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.710
It didn't help the intersection
had a traffic camera, either.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.513
My advice is, you let me
go to the prosecutor now,

20:15.515 --> 20:15.513
get him to make a deal.

20:15.515 --> 20:19.717
Because if we go to trial, he
will stick to the maximums.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.719
That's what they do.
That's how it works.

20:21.721 --> 20:21.719
What kind of deal?

20:21.721 --> 20:24.956
Look, you agree to
a no-contest plea...

20:24.958 --> 20:27.358
I think I can get him
to two years on count one,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.560
reduce the great
bodily injury enhancement...

20:29.562 --> 20:31.762
To what's called
a dui with injury.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.599
Now, that drops the additional
three years to eight months.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.568
It means...

20:37.570 --> 20:40.404
Realistically you'd only
have to do 16 months.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.407
Yeah, 16 months. Ehm...

20:43.409 --> 20:45.309
It's your call, pal.

20:56.622 --> 20:57.622
Hey.

20:57.624 --> 20:58.889
Hi.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.459
Okay, so they accepted
the house as collateral.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.862
So I can bail you out,
get you outta there. Okay?

21:06.932 --> 21:09.333
What? Did something happen?
What?

21:13.305 --> 21:15.640
I know this is gonna
be hard to take...

21:15.642 --> 21:18.909
But Steve got them
to accept a deal.

21:20.345 --> 21:23.648
If I plead no-contest,
they'll agree to two years...

21:23.650 --> 21:24.815
-No!
-...Eight months.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.350
No, we're fighting this.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.286
If we do, I'm
facing seven years.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.554
If we win this, you face none.

21:30.556 --> 21:31.555
Kate...

21:31.557 --> 21:32.590
What?

21:32.592 --> 21:35.493
Honey, I blew a point .10.

21:36.561 --> 21:38.029
I ran the red.

21:40.932 --> 21:42.767
I killed tom.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.636
-It was an accident.
It was an accident.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.570
I know.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.606
-I don't care what Steve says.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.608
People don't go
away for accidents!

21:51.443 --> 21:55.513
Jennifer and Tina will
never see tom again.

21:55.914 --> 21:57.982
I'm responsible.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.918
Sixteen months,
it's nothing compared to

22:00.920 --> 22:02.553
what they're going through.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.623
No!

22:19.071 --> 22:20.971
Programmed my number into both.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.007
Erase it from this
one so it's clean.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.582
-Where are we heading?

22:31.584 --> 22:34.118
-East L.A.
Lola's flowers on Beverly.

22:42.661 --> 22:44.428
Any word about last night?

22:44.430 --> 22:45.629
I haven't heard anything yet.

22:45.631 --> 22:45.629
And the girl?

22:45.631 --> 22:49.567
She'll be okay. Luckily,
the round went through clean.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.001
She solid?

22:51.003 --> 22:53.671
Definitely.
Janie won't say shit.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.542
Put the word out,
anybody ID's me at that party,

22:58.544 --> 22:59.710
they're green-lit.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.579
Roger that.

23:17.529 --> 23:19.163
Can I help you?

23:19.165 --> 23:21.065
I'm looking
for Herman Gomez.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.068
Orale.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.637
It's been a long time, man.

23:28.173 --> 23:29.740
It sure has.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.810
Here you go, baby. We're
gonna be in the back, okay?

23:33.412 --> 23:34.779
Call me if you need me.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.419
I hate those pinches
coolers, man.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.754
Fucking hate them.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.190
In and out all
day from the cold.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.559
Makes my bones hurt.

23:49.528 --> 23:50.728
Have a seat.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.765
You have a beautiful family.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.834
Thank you, homes.
Appreciate it.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.737
What about you?
You got a lady, got kids?

23:59.739 --> 24:01.138
Used to.

24:02.073 --> 24:05.176
The world went on
without us, huh?

24:06.578 --> 24:08.512
Feel for you, homes.
I do.

24:08.514 --> 24:11.649
Spent 17 years total inside.
What a fucking waste.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.858
You know why I asked the
beast for you to handle this?

24:21.526 --> 24:22.793
You asked for me?

24:22.795 --> 24:24.094
Simón.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.164
To me, a man is only
defined by his actions.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.166
Appreciate it.

24:30.068 --> 24:32.036
I'm the one who's
gotta be grateful.

24:33.071 --> 24:34.839
Youngster out there,
he's the one with the guns?

24:34.841 --> 24:36.006
No.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.975
Your friends set the location?

24:37.977 --> 24:40.511
Midnight.
Pretty close to the salton sea.

24:41.079 --> 24:43.247
We're gonna get exact
coordinates one hour before.

24:50.956 --> 24:53.224
We both need this to go smooth.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.926
It will.

24:58.096 --> 25:00.097
Can't wait for
this cheese steak.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.833
Used to come here a lot?

25:04.135 --> 25:05.836
It's a short walk
from my office.

25:06.605 --> 25:10.274
Sorry, but I just can't
picture you in a suit.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.243
All Gordon gekko and shit.

25:12.245 --> 25:15.279
You were probably
what, 12 back then?

25:15.281 --> 25:16.747
-About that.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.522
Where you from?

25:24.524 --> 25:27.224
Small farm town, Pennsylvania.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.093
Boring as hell.

25:29.728 --> 25:32.296
So, you know, when
i came back...

25:32.298 --> 25:35.199
I decided to come out here
and check out the beach.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.536
How did you come
across the guns?

25:38.538 --> 25:40.070
Sheer luck.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.806
Dod was shipping plane-loads
of them to arm the

25:42.808 --> 25:47.044
Afghan security forces
but thousands went missing.

25:48.780 --> 25:52.182
Anyway, one night, my
unit hit a Taliban house.

25:52.184 --> 25:55.119
I was clearing a back
room, found a trap door...

25:56.555 --> 25:57.922
Boom.

25:57.924 --> 26:01.225
Whole cache of aks and glocks
were down in a hidden tunnel.

26:01.227 --> 26:01.225
All of them?

26:01.227 --> 26:04.061
Yeah.
They just piled them in there.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.730
So I sealed it up,
didn't tell my C.O.

26:08.333 --> 26:12.136
Fucking muj's, they'd just
used them against us anyway.

26:13.605 --> 26:16.907
So I found these contractor
dudes who agreed to load them

26:16.909 --> 26:19.276
in a container heading
back to the states.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.745
Cost me a hundred of the
aks---wait, wait.

26:22.347 --> 26:24.615
You're telling me
there's just 900 now.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.953
No.
There was 11 hundred to start.

26:28.955 --> 26:32.723
I figured a hundred was pretty
cheap to get them home but

26:32.725 --> 26:35.659
then again we're talking about
Soviet factory full-autos,

26:35.661 --> 26:38.629
not that cheap-ass Chinese
knock-off bullshit.

26:46.671 --> 26:48.939
He said he needed
to see you, money.

26:54.312 --> 26:56.814
Fucking knucklehead
skins from the party, man.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.616
I said to them,
i said, lay the fuck low.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.050
They didn't listen to me, okay?
They've been butting heads

27:00.052 --> 27:01.785
with these fucking
crippers from the beach.

27:01.787 --> 27:01.785
Those toads, they
knew that house.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.788
So you're telling
me it was a drive-by.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.256
I'm just telling
you what I told them--

27:06.258 --> 27:08.392
it sure didn't feel random,
that gun aimed at my face.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.661
Hey, look, it's on me.
This is fucking on me.

27:10.663 --> 27:10.661
But I'm gonna fucking hit them.

27:10.663 --> 27:10.661
I'm gonna check their fucking
asses, I'm gonna find out who

27:10.663 --> 27:14.999
took those shots and I'm
gonna fucking hit them.

27:15.001 --> 27:14.999
Not until the deal's done.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.835
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'm on it.

27:20.205 --> 27:21.905
Man, I know you like
the fucking kid.

27:21.907 --> 27:23.374
I like the kid, too, man.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.376
I mean, gi Joe over there
in fucking Afghanistan.

27:25.378 --> 27:26.877
But that's not
where we are, is it?

27:26.879 --> 27:28.912
You know who I am.
You know what I'm about.

27:28.914 --> 27:31.115
Now, I need to be with you. I
need to be on your fucking hip--

27:31.117 --> 27:34.218
you know I can't be seen
around anyone validated.

27:35.387 --> 27:39.056
Like I'm doing right now
in broad fucking daylight!

27:41.092 --> 27:42.760
Now, you get everyone in check.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.796
We got too much on the
line for any more bullshit!

27:49.134 --> 27:50.734
Just be careful.

27:53.805 --> 27:55.305
Fuck me!

28:04.049 --> 28:06.150
You were told to answer
to nobody but me.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.918
I'm sorry--
-shut your hole!

28:09.020 --> 28:10.921
Look at me.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.859
Everything you do in this
game has a consequence.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.064
If you defied my
order like that inside,

28:20.066 --> 28:21.965
I'd make you fucking bleed.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.835
I will walk the walk, money.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.170
I swear.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.239
Damn right you will.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.711
Open east gate.

28:59.938 --> 29:01.305
High security first!

29:02.207 --> 29:04.875
Look, man,
i know you're scared. All right?

29:04.877 --> 29:07.811
I would be scared.
But you need to know this-

29:08.279 --> 29:10.147
all violent crimes,
from domestic

29:10.149 --> 29:12.816
battery to capital murder,
get housed together.

29:14.352 --> 29:16.353
It means you'll be
with the big boys...

29:17.355 --> 29:20.057
And they will test you,
whether you like it or not.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.792
The rest
of you, single file.

29:22.827 --> 29:24.328
So you gotta
stand up for yourself...

29:24.330 --> 29:26.797
Because once you're
marked in there...

29:27.499 --> 29:29.166
It will never end.

29:59.097 --> 30:00.798
Yo, bring that in!

30:00.800 --> 30:02.332
This the real place.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.867
This the real place, yo!

30:05.069 --> 30:06.236
You gonna roll with us or not?

32:19.070 --> 32:21.204
Best check yourself, peckerwood!

32:22.507 --> 32:24.574
Looks like some lame
just stepped on a land mine.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.143
-Yo, motherfucker, move!

32:26.544 --> 32:28.445
I'm fucking about
to boot your ass!

32:30.381 --> 32:33.350
Get down! Get down!
Now, get down!

32:33.352 --> 32:35.385
Get the fuck down right now!
Everybody down!

32:35.387 --> 32:37.487
All right, break it up!
Get off him!

32:39.023 --> 32:40.290
Get on the ground!

32:40.292 --> 32:41.625
Spray 'em!

32:45.663 --> 32:48.265
Stay down. Stay down.
Just breathe.

32:51.602 --> 32:53.236
Fish has heart.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.174
Get on the wall.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.348
Step in.

33:10.054 --> 33:12.522
You throw any piss or shit...

33:12.524 --> 33:15.459
I'll leave you in here
for the whole 30, no rec.

33:16.427 --> 33:18.195
Leave your dirties by the door.

33:40.118 --> 33:41.551
Turn around.

33:52.597 --> 33:54.664
No new inks since your release?

33:54.666 --> 33:58.402
Thought I might
find a shamrock or ab.

33:58.404 --> 34:01.038
Only a select few
can wear that ink.

34:01.806 --> 34:03.306
I see.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.677
Get dressed.

34:09.347 --> 34:10.781
Need you to clear something up.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.784
Girl got shot last night
out in south bay...

34:14.786 --> 34:17.454
And someone reported
you were there.

34:18.422 --> 34:19.790
Then they got it wrong.

34:19.792 --> 34:22.525
I need an alibi.

34:22.527 --> 34:25.228
Got a room at the easy
stay motel near downtown,

34:25.230 --> 34:26.596
till I find an apartment.

34:30.268 --> 34:33.235
Says here you checked
in at 6:35 P.M.

34:34.272 --> 34:36.273
But the shooting
was after midnight.

34:36.275 --> 34:39.208
That's all I got.
Paid cash with the rest

34:39.210 --> 34:41.710
of my gate money for a
steak dinner at sizzler's.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.612
Hit the bunk after that.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.581
Not much of an alibi.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.784
Not much putting me
at the scene either.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.853
I figure you'd already be
giving me a one year bullet

34:49.855 --> 34:51.621
for breaking parole.

34:53.391 --> 34:55.158
Don't think I won't.

34:56.327 --> 34:58.295
When do I report in again?

34:58.297 --> 34:59.496
You don't.

34:59.864 --> 35:01.765
I check in on you.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.767
Got a cell phone yet?

35:03.769 --> 35:05.469
I wrote the number
down on the form.

35:05.471 --> 35:06.403
Good.

35:06.871 --> 35:08.605
Thank you.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.222
Wood.

35:26.357 --> 35:27.524
Come with me.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.633
The man you're about to meet
has the keys to this yard.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.568
Treat him with respect.

35:45.376 --> 35:47.177
I'm bottles.

35:48.379 --> 35:49.646
Jacob.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.581
Yeah, the stock
broker from Pasadena.

35:53.784 --> 35:57.854
When you come to yard, chow,
you take a shit, whatever...

35:57.856 --> 35:59.623
You stick to your own race.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.892
Why did you fight that toad?

36:02.693 --> 36:02.692
He challenged me first.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.529
You gonna go around kicking
it off with every buster

36:05.531 --> 36:05.529
that calls you out?

36:05.531 --> 36:08.498
I'm not looking for trouble, no.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.434
But I'm not taking
any shit either.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.439
The only thing we got
in here is our respect.

36:16.441 --> 36:18.341
The question is, what you gonna
do when you're out here slumming

36:18.343 --> 36:20.177
it with the rest of us?

36:20.179 --> 36:23.580
Cause the safety of these
numbers comes with a price.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.916
There are no free rides here.

36:25.918 --> 36:27.918
Everyone puts in work,
whether cliqued up or not.

36:27.920 --> 36:27.918
I understand.

36:27.920 --> 36:31.555
I'm not talking about helping
us with our computer skills.

36:33.224 --> 36:35.959
You'll get your fucking hands
dirty like the rest of us.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.428
Or you can go back to seeing
how that lone bullshit works

36:38.430 --> 36:39.663
out for you, money man.

36:55.580 --> 36:56.713
Hey.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.981
-Hi.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.255
Joshua made you a letter...

37:05.257 --> 37:08.425
And he's very excited
for you to read it.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.794
He did it all by himself, and...

37:10.796 --> 37:15.498
I wanted to give it to you, but
some guard up front took it.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.501
I know, I know, but
they'll get it back to me.

37:18.503 --> 37:19.502
Good.

37:19.504 --> 37:20.904
Can't wait to read it.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.473
I think you'll like it.

37:24.342 --> 37:25.642
How is he?

37:29.547 --> 37:31.314
-Ehm...

37:31.316 --> 37:32.749
He's really good.

37:38.756 --> 37:39.689
Sorry.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.394
-It's okay.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.498
It's good to see you.

37:50.801 --> 37:53.903
Kate, something's wrong.
What is it?

37:56.274 --> 37:59.576
Ehm, Jennifer's suing
us for wrongful death.

38:01.545 --> 38:03.013
I mean, I...

38:04.615 --> 38:07.484
I don't know what to
do with that, but...

38:08.853 --> 38:10.787
How much is in our checking?

38:10.789 --> 38:13.423
Three months, maybe.

38:13.425 --> 38:16.293
I called Lynn, 'cause I'm
gonna get my job back.

38:16.295 --> 38:20.463
No. No, you're not quitting
school when you're this close.

38:20.465 --> 38:21.765
I don't have a choice.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.034
I have to pay
bills, Jacob, so...

38:24.036 --> 38:25.902
Look, it'll take her at least
six months to get a court

38:25.904 --> 38:28.905
date and we have
some equity on the house.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.373
Yes.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.442
Use our equity line while
we put it on the market.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.311
I'm not selling our home.
I'm not.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.513
It's just a house, Kate.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.081
It'll help stretch things
long enough for you to

38:38.083 --> 38:40.450
get your design license,
and that's what matters.

38:40.452 --> 38:40.450
It's our home.

38:40.452 --> 38:44.321
Your life is not
stopping because of this.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.559
You promise me.

38:50.728 --> 38:51.928
Yeah?

38:53.798 --> 38:55.031
Yeah.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.734
Thank you.

39:15.820 --> 39:16.986
Kate?

39:17.788 --> 39:19.389
Shit.

39:20.424 --> 39:21.758
Jacob.

39:29.533 --> 39:32.369
Must feel good to be out...

39:33.771 --> 39:35.105
I would imagine.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.808
Drove by old house and...

39:39.877 --> 39:41.878
Doesn't look much different,
to tell you the truth.

39:43.748 --> 39:45.448
So, where are you working?

39:46.517 --> 39:48.985
I'm working in a legal firm.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.887
It's a...

39:50.889 --> 39:52.789
I'm a paralegal.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.991
Ever think about pushing your
interior designing again?

39:56.627 --> 39:58.061
No.

39:59.697 --> 40:02.499
No, there's no time for that.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.502
You know, it's just between
work and being a mom, it's...

40:06.570 --> 40:08.171
It's fine.
It is what it is.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.747
Why'd you send him that letter?

40:17.749 --> 40:20.550
Josh thought you were
committing suicide.

40:27.658 --> 40:29.092
This is for you.

40:30.528 --> 40:33.196
They're signature cards
to your new checking.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.031
Have them notarized,
then get them back to me.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.699
You're not gonna
answer my question?

40:36.701 --> 40:38.701
There's 178 grand in there.

40:38.703 --> 40:41.538
I don't know how you got that
money, and I don't care.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.706
You need to keep that.
I'm not taking it.

40:43.708 --> 40:44.707
No, it's yours now.

40:44.709 --> 40:45.708
I'm not taking
your gang money!

40:45.710 --> 40:45.708
Just keep it down.

40:45.710 --> 40:49.179
Don't tell me what to do.
You don't get to do that.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.582
I don't hear from
you for seven years.

40:53.651 --> 40:54.851
Nothing!

40:56.153 --> 40:57.821
I mean, how do you
even now where I live?

41:05.029 --> 41:07.096
I'm not trying
anything here, Kate.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.065
The money's clean.

41:09.067 --> 41:12.101
I just couldn't get it
to you until I was out.

41:12.103 --> 41:15.004
Okay. What is this?

41:15.606 --> 41:17.474
Is this my consolation prize?

41:18.476 --> 41:20.210
Give it to Josh then.
Whatever you want--

41:20.212 --> 41:23.513
you give it to Josh.
He deserves a dad.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.582
I wrote him that letter...

41:25.584 --> 41:28.918
Because I won't let my stink
affect him another day.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.821
He deserves better.

41:33.791 --> 41:35.658
And you deserve better.

41:37.595 --> 41:40.830
Once that's handled, it'll
be the last time you see me.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.792
Your order from the canteen?

42:37.021 --> 42:39.622
There's gonna be
a balloon in your canteen.

42:39.624 --> 42:41.558
You're responsible for it.

42:43.961 --> 42:45.061
What do I do with it?

42:45.063 --> 42:46.763
Take it to yard tomorrow.

42:46.765 --> 42:48.231
How?

42:48.233 --> 42:49.899
In your fucking ass, man.

42:51.302 --> 42:52.735
Make sure you lube-up, too.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.904
You don't want this shit
breaking off inside you.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.741
The fuck you looking
at the floor for?

43:00.010 --> 43:02.145
Is there a problem?
Hm?

43:02.147 --> 43:04.647
I get it. You think
you're bad ass 'cause you

43:04.649 --> 43:06.783
put your tips on
some fucking toad?

43:06.785 --> 43:09.018
Maybe I should get you
transferred into my side.

43:09.020 --> 43:11.020
I got a open door policy, bro.

43:11.022 --> 43:13.723
Find out how a white boy fights.
Would you like to find that out?

43:13.725 --> 43:14.958
We don't have a problem.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.593
No problem?
-No.

44:43.848 --> 44:46.416
No loitering, jinkins.
Let's go.

44:46.418 --> 44:48.017
Just keeping
good hygiene, sir.

45:23.954 --> 45:26.155
Keep putting it in
that work, money man.

46:25.182 --> 46:27.450
Fuck out of the way, man.
Don't you see me fucking coming?

46:27.452 --> 46:29.218
Fuck out of the way.

46:53.377 --> 46:55.578
We'll get the location
from the eses tomorrow

46:55.580 --> 46:58.514
night an hour before.
We got a problem here?

47:00.918 --> 47:02.852
No, man, there's no problem.

47:03.554 --> 47:06.522
No, it's just that's not
a lot of time, you know.

47:06.524 --> 47:08.391
We have no idea what
we're walking into.

47:08.393 --> 47:10.393
I'm just trying to
protect you, that's all.

47:10.395 --> 47:12.228
Shit, man, you got it.
You got it, bro.

47:12.230 --> 47:13.596
I'm here for you, man.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.832
I'm good.

47:21.205 --> 47:23.339
Stash still out in the I.E.?

47:23.341 --> 47:26.475
Moreno valley.
A storage unit.

47:26.477 --> 47:28.144
Anybody check it lately?

47:28.146 --> 47:30.413
I was out there yesterday.
It's good.

47:30.415 --> 47:33.583
Yeah. Shotgun knows
the on-site manager.

47:36.587 --> 47:38.621
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's
good, it's good. He's gonna

47:38.623 --> 47:40.990
cut the camera as soon as we
drive in. I'm on that shit.

47:40.992 --> 47:42.391
Let's keep vehicles
to a minimum.

47:42.393 --> 47:45.228
Just the moving truck and
a scout. Who's cleanest?

47:45.230 --> 47:47.496
Horvath. He's been
off parole for two years.

47:47.498 --> 47:50.266
You're scout. The rest of us
will load up in the truck.

47:50.268 --> 47:52.001
You know what's riding on this.

47:52.003 --> 47:54.237
Now, go home, lay low.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.285
Get a ride with chopper.

48:09.287 --> 48:10.419
Sure.

49:21.391 --> 49:24.527
I tried, man. He's not giving up
the exchange. He said he's gonna

49:24.529 --> 49:26.629
let us know an hour before,
that's what he said. I tried.

49:26.631 --> 49:29.131
I done everything you
asked me to do, man.

49:30.434 --> 49:31.567
Cool.

49:32.402 --> 49:33.736
Then you wear a wire.

49:33.738 --> 49:35.571
You can't ask me to
wear a fucking wire!

49:35.573 --> 49:35.571
Don't come to me with that!

49:35.573 --> 49:37.707
How you want me
to come at you?

49:37.709 --> 49:39.041
That means I'm a
fucking dead man!

49:39.043 --> 49:40.376
If I'm a dead man,
you ain't got shit!

49:40.378 --> 49:43.446
You chose this. So, unless
you produce, Monica stays

49:43.448 --> 49:45.715
locked up for trafficking,
and you're next.

49:48.352 --> 49:49.618
I'm trying to
help you out, man.

49:49.620 --> 49:50.753
And I'm here.

49:50.755 --> 49:53.622
I'm fucking here, man.
I'm fucking here.

49:53.624 --> 49:55.391
I done everything
you asked me to do.

49:55.393 --> 49:57.026
I can't help it if
he ain't giving me shit--

49:57.028 --> 49:58.561
and I can't help you
and your old lady if you

49:58.563 --> 50:00.029
don't give me shit.
It's simple.

50:01.231 --> 50:02.465
It's simple.

50:03.567 --> 50:05.267
What do you suggest
i do, frank, huh?

50:06.670 --> 50:08.571
You tracking my phone, right?

50:08.573 --> 50:10.639
Just do the phone thing, man.

50:11.541 --> 50:13.776
Just do the phone thing.

50:23.253 --> 50:25.087
Frank, listen to me.

50:25.089 --> 50:27.790
I'm gonna say it
one time, all right?

50:28.592 --> 50:31.160
If your fucking cell phone
loses its signal even for a

50:31.162 --> 50:32.762
millisecond- be quiet.

50:32.764 --> 50:36.298
Then I'm kicking your
trafficking charges up to DEA.

50:36.300 --> 50:38.701
All my friends there gonna
take care of you and Monica

50:38.703 --> 50:41.404
real well. Fair time.
You know what that means?

50:41.406 --> 50:44.240
A fucking mandatory
twenty right off the top.

50:45.308 --> 50:47.076
It's the position
you're putting me in.

50:48.445 --> 50:49.578
All right?

50:49.580 --> 50:51.080
-Yeah.

50:51.082 --> 50:52.048
Can I ask you something?

50:52.050 --> 50:53.249
What, frank?

50:53.251 --> 50:56.285
I deliver, she comes home.
I want your word.

50:56.287 --> 50:57.520
Yeah.

50:58.321 --> 50:59.688
I want your word, man.

50:59.690 --> 51:02.091
I said, yeah.

51:02.592 --> 51:04.360
You got my word.

51:04.362 --> 51:06.095
Look, man, she's
my life, okay?

51:07.097 --> 51:08.731
She's my fucking life, man.

51:08.733 --> 51:10.666
Ball's in your court, frank.

51:12.102 --> 51:14.170
Catch you later, frank.

53:01.945 --> 53:03.946
It's your turn,
money man.

53:05.649 --> 53:07.917
I know you're shitting
bricks right about now.

53:07.919 --> 53:10.419
Trying to rationalize
the morality.

53:10.421 --> 53:12.321
What will your
family think of you?

53:12.323 --> 53:14.690
How will they judge you?
All of that went through

53:14.692 --> 53:17.259
my head, too,
when I first broke my cherry.

53:17.261 --> 53:19.628
And then I realized
none of that matters.

53:21.865 --> 53:23.499
The only thing that matters
is you getting home to

53:23.501 --> 53:25.267
your family in one piece.

53:26.603 --> 53:28.671
This guy's a monster, brother.
Make sure you're with me.

53:28.673 --> 53:30.906
How can they know
he's really snitching?

53:30.908 --> 53:30.906
Doesn't matter!

53:30.908 --> 53:34.877
If we leave him breathing,
they'll whack us, okay?

53:40.984 --> 53:42.885
All right, they're popping 'em.
It's time.

53:45.422 --> 53:47.656
Come here! Come here!
We're doing this!

53:50.794 --> 53:52.628
All right, before
he hits the tier.

54:22.359 --> 54:23.726
Get him!

54:42.846 --> 54:45.547
-The fact is we all
started out as someone's

54:45.549 --> 54:47.016
little angel.

54:53.023 --> 54:56.659
And a place like this forces us
to become warriors or victims.

55:00.697 --> 55:03.399
Nothing in between
can exist here.

55:18.481 --> 55:20.849
And you've chosen
to be a warrior.

55:23.753 --> 55:25.954
Now it's up to
you to remain one.

56:10.400 --> 56:11.800
Did you get it notarized?

56:12.936 --> 56:14.903
Uhm yes. Yes, I did.

56:28.685 --> 56:30.619
I told you not
to bring him here.

56:30.621 --> 56:32.955
I know, but he wanted
to be here, so...

56:38.561 --> 56:40.929
I'm gonna stay by the car, okay?

56:40.931 --> 56:42.431
Okay.

56:52.842 --> 56:54.009
Look...

56:55.111 --> 56:57.413
I meant every word
in that letter, so...

56:57.415 --> 56:59.515
I don't have much else to say.

57:03.953 --> 57:06.755
You know, I used to love
getting your letters.

57:06.757 --> 57:09.658
I reread them like
a dozen times.

57:09.660 --> 57:13.195
And then nothing from you
for the past seven years.

57:14.597 --> 57:16.064
And then I get this one.

57:18.935 --> 57:20.669
Even when you knew you were
getting out, you still want

57:20.671 --> 57:21.804
nothing to do with your son.

57:21.806 --> 57:22.938
It's not that.

57:24.841 --> 57:27.042
Some things just don't
go back together again.

57:27.044 --> 57:27.042
They just don't.

57:29.179 --> 57:33.015
You, your mom, are on
your own trajectory now.

57:33.017 --> 57:34.650
I'm on another one.

57:34.652 --> 57:36.552
What, just wasting the
rest of your life, dad?

57:36.554 --> 57:38.220
It doesn't matter what I do!

57:39.656 --> 57:43.525
Your job is to take care
of yourself and your mom.

57:43.527 --> 57:46.628
Look, I get why
you pushed us away.

57:48.164 --> 57:49.898
It was to protect us.

57:51.734 --> 57:53.902
But, dad, you've
done your time now.

57:54.671 --> 57:56.038
It's over.

57:56.773 --> 57:59.041
Let us help you get
back on your feet.

58:00.043 --> 58:01.643
Please.

58:04.247 --> 58:05.581
You wanna help me?

58:05.583 --> 58:06.081
Yeah, I do.

58:10.253 --> 58:11.720
Then stay away.

58:14.190 --> 58:16.258
You're a fucking loser!

58:19.863 --> 58:21.563
Just get in the car.

58:22.265 --> 58:23.966
Oohh...

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:14.109
What can I get you today?

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.777
An order of pancakes...

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.080
Scrambled eggs and bacon,
and a cup of coffee, please.

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:19.114
All right.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:20.916
-Same for me.
-Okay.

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:22.751
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Please and thank you.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.987
I need another car.

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:26.722
Janie's Nissan's out front.

01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:28.323
It's a piece of
shit, but it's clean.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:30.759
Did my truck break down?

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.928
No. We'll pick it up tomorrow.

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.297
Get me shotgun's address.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.199
I'll pick him up myself.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.001
Will do.

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:45.774
How did you meet shotgun?

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:51.346
Did I do something wrong, money?

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.816
Just never told me.

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:04.259
A guy from my unit, he's
from huntington beach.

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:07.663
We were real tight.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.231
Yeah.

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:13.935
All he talked about was this
skinhead gang he was with

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:15.337
and surfing.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.305
Man...

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:20.175
He was gonna teach me
when he got back, but...

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.745
He got blown up.

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:29.685
When I went to the
funeral, I met Janie.

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:32.187
She's his sister. I told
her about the guns because

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.423
her brother and i
were gonna sell them.

01:01:34.425 --> 01:01:36.825
We were supposed to
sell them together.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:38.894
And she introduced
me to shotgun.

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.063
-Two coffees.

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.372
So shotgun...

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.476
He's jumping you in for this.

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:01.049
I don't wanna be
a part of a gang.

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.229
Who's with bottles?

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:20.302
-Herman Gomez. He's got the
keys to the yard for the eses.

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:23.872
His old man's royalty, bro.
Fucking ogma.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:26.475
Herman's solid, solid as fuck.

01:02:26.477 --> 01:02:29.244
You make sure you treat him
like he's one of our own.

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:34.249
Word already came
down from the beast.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.119
Eses kicking off
with the toads, bro.

01:02:37.121 --> 01:02:39.921
I'm fucking going with them.
Fucking live for this shit.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.823
-I heard that, brother.
-Fuck, yeah.

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:46.394
Damn,
i can't be part of a riot.

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:48.230
Don't expect a
hall pass, brother.

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:50.799
Whole wood pile's
expected to get down.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:58.006
Just don't go anywhere the cops
or cameras can single you out.

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.809
Stay in the middle,
keep swinging on dudes.

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.778
Unless there's something
obvious, they'll just put us on

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.379
lockdown like they always do.

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:07.082
Then you're home free.

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:39.915
Iron up.

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:23.558
Fuck these busters
and these blacks homies!

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.394
Go! Earn your ink!

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:29.531
Oh, shit!

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.099
They're moving! It's on!

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:08.370
Come on.

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.406
Aahh!!

01:06:07.998 --> 01:06:09.698
Get down!
Get down! Get down!

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:13.535
Stay down or I will shoot you!

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:15.704
I fucking owe you one.

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:18.740
-Nobody get up!
Stay where you are!

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:54.509
Please rise.

01:06:57.546 --> 01:07:00.448
Mr. harlon, with this
court finding you guilty of

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.784
assault by a prisoner
with a deadly weapon

01:07:02.786 --> 01:07:05.453
I'm sentencing you to the
middle term of four years.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:09.124
In addition, having been found
guilty of committing this crime

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.526
in association and for
the benefit of a gang,

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:14.229
I'm sentencing you to an
additional five years to

01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:18.500
run consecutively. Penal
code 667.5 requires that you

01:07:18.502 --> 01:07:22.270
serve a minimum of 85
percent of these terms.

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:25.140
Both will run concurrently
with your initial sentence.

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:35.450
It's over.
Forget I exist.

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.761
You'll be locked
down 23/7 in the security

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:48.696
housing unit with
one hour yard time.

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:50.598
Three showers a week.
You will not be allowed in the

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.468
same open area as any other
inmate, outside your cellie.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:55.403
And there will be
no warning shots.

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:57.705
You cliqued up with anyone?

01:07:57.707 --> 01:07:58.606
No.

01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:00.408
Why participate in the riot?

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:01.776
You know why.

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:05.413
You got your rules and
we got the gang's rules.

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:07.682
And theirs matter.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.722
Yeah, well, it cost you
a year of good time on top of

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:17.658
the new sentences and put you
with the heavy hitters, so...

01:08:19.127 --> 01:08:21.196
I hope it was worth it.

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:23.231
You know the deal,
ripper. Face the wall.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.571
Crack 13.

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:38.746
Close 13.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:44.185
Hands through the food port.

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:57.698
You can get up, ripper.

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:07.542
Welcome to the pad, money.
I'm ripper.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.546
Who's got the keys here?

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:13.148
Redwood, from the brand.

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.653
Open forward yard door.

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:47.442
Redwood, this is money.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.284
Heard how you got down at chino.

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:58.620
So did the beast.

01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:01.956
Appreciate it.
He still in the hole?

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:04.425
Four hundred yards to my six.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.427
Less nine years.

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:10.965
Little different than
the mainline, huh?

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:13.601
You could say that.

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:17.438
Make no mistake, brother,
they design places like

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.641
this to break men like us.

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.815
Eses and woods.

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:30.485
500 Navy seals.
Ripper, count 'em.

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:31.486
Ready!

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:33.521
Down!

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:35.757
One, two, three!

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:37.525
One!

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:38.626
Down!

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.062
One, two, three!

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:42.530
Two!

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:43.631
Down!

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:45.967
One, two, three!

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:47.669
Three!

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:48.836
Down!

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:51.072
One, two, three!

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:52.740
Four!

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.345
Whassup?

01:11:58.614 --> 01:12:00.615
Thought you were
posting up on your ci.

01:12:00.617 --> 01:12:02.483
-Since three A.M.

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.086
Figured I'd get some
chow and take a piss.

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:07.522
Any movement?

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:10.358
-Nada. You know, I can't
put my finger on it, Manny,

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.094
but there's more
to this harlon guy.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:15.063
What you mean,
like a power play?

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:18.866
Phil says his wife and
his kid show up to his motel,

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:18.866
slams the door in their face.

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:23.838
I mean, you talking about a guy
with a perfect life, all right?

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:26.374
A fucking envious life.

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:28.810
He's got not one prior.

01:12:28.812 --> 01:12:31.012
Can't even fucking spell
the word gangster, man.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.881
He gets fucked up on a dui
manslaughter, kills his friend.

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:36.384
Yeah, a dime will change you for
sure, but a guy like that...

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:38.052
Gets out, throws
everything away?

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:38.052
No.

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:41.823
Look, all I know is, once a
dude gets institutionalized,

01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:43.558
anything is possible, man.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.594
What you got?

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:48.363
Still squat on the eses.

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:52.834
But atf did pick up a call
from Mexico on the wiretap.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:55.803
Something about picking up
guns near the salton sea.

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.706
So at least we
know the area now.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.007
Who's the tap on?

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.711
Heavy hitter from
the sonora cartel.

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:07.115
And of course atf wants
any and all intel we got.

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:09.917
Sonora, huh?

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:10.551
Yeah.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:14.522
This thing just keeps on
getting bigger and bigger.

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.793
Maybe it's not a bad idea to
have atf out there with us.

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:24.699
Hey, you know what,
check it out, bro.

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:27.535
Why don't you just quarterback
this one from the office?

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:29.971
I mean, shit, what's it been,
a week since the shooting?

01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:32.640
Sit around with a thumb up my
ass? Come on, you kidding me?

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:34.942
That's worse, man.

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:41.682
Sure as hell have seen my
share of violence, man,

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:43.684
but when you're in it...

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:46.587
When you're on the other end...

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.793
That's a whole different
ball game, brother.

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:59.700
Look, man, I've never been in
an actual gunfight myself...

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:01.836
So I'm not gonna sit here and
tell you I know what you're

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:03.671
going through, because I don't.

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:07.141
But what I do know is that
there's a young girl out there

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:08.976
who's safe right now.

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:11.846
And that's because of you.

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:36.671
Goddamn, man.
It sucks.

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:38.873
It's good.

01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:41.042
I want her to move on.

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:01.028
Shit!
Get him on the ground!

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:03.798
Get him, money!
-Get down!

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.000
On the yard. One on one.
Enemy combat. Enemy combat.

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.804
Fuck that norteño up,
homie! Get him!

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:15.810
Money!
Money, let him go!

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:17.144
Rip that farmer's head off!

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:18.513
-Spray him!

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.548
Get down! Get down now!

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:32.760
One!

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.530
Two!

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:37.198
Three!

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.667
Hey.

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:42.069
Your counselor wants to see you.

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:49.977
Since when do you escort alone?

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.812
Why, you gonna be a problem?

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.581
No, sir.

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:21.042
Know who I am?

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.778
Yes.

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.080
They sent redwood to death
row after what happened.

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:31.652
It took him four months to
finally get that screw.

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:33.754
Fuck 'em.

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:36.357
These cops...

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.794
They need to understand...

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.063
That we run the show.

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:45.232
Some get it.

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:47.868
Like Roberts.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:53.207
But the rest think the
more they lock us down...

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:55.276
And isolate us...

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.713
It strips us of our power.

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:02.016
They even think we
closed the books.

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.652
We're a dying breed.

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.755
They're dead fucking wrong.

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:10.891
We're just real selective...

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:14.095
Who we choose to
call our brother.

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:17.932
So the question is...

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:22.269
Are you ready?

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.243
Yes.

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:33.781
What I wanted to hear.

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:37.318
But keep your ink clean so
they can't validate you.

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.887
That's how we lull
the enemy to sleep.

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:41.956
I understand.

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:44.392
You have the keys out here now.

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:46.927
Roberts will single-cell you.

01:17:46.929 --> 01:17:48.896
Get you some privacy.

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:51.065
Works for me.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.334
You like to read?

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:56.003
I got a good collection
on psychology.

01:17:57.272 --> 01:17:59.440
Just finished reading
the human animal.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.277
I'll send it over with
some of my favorites.

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.882
A warrior's deadliest weapon...

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:11.285
Is his mind.

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:16.090
Welcome to the family, brother.

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:50.384
Mr. harlon,

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:53.154
after serving 85
percent of your time...

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:56.357
Having a clean conduct record
with no infractions...

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:59.360
I recommend to the parole
board your release...

01:19:59.362 --> 01:20:00.995
30 days from today.

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.899
This is your parole packet.

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:06.433
Tells you who to report to.

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:10.204
Thank you.

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:43.337
Push send.
And I'll be back for it in 30.

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.592
You know shotgun?

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:08.295
He just sent word to me about
a heavy shipment of guns

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:10.497
a youngster smuggled
back from Afghanistan.

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:12.600
He wants permission to go
to Herman Gomez to offload

01:21:12.602 --> 01:21:15.536
them for a million five
to their cartel connections.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:17.137
Herman got his letters?

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:18.472
And he's out, too.

01:21:18.474 --> 01:21:21.075
Just like you'll be in 30 days.

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:25.045
I'll get word to Herman you're
handling the deal for us.

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:27.014
And fuck our usual cut.

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:29.250
Shotgun just bought himself
a full partner on this.

01:21:29.252 --> 01:21:29.250
I'll be on parole though.

01:21:29.252 --> 01:21:31.518
The fuck's that got
to do with anything?

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.953
Well, 10 years--

01:21:32.955 --> 01:21:34.655
you think the fucking
honor of being one of us

01:21:34.657 --> 01:21:37.491
ends at the gates? It ends
when you're six feet under.

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:39.894
Until then, you will keep
earning for your brothers.

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:39.894
I understand that--

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:43.330
before you say
another fucking word...

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:45.566
Think of your family
in this decision.

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:47.401
Excuse me?

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.403
Did I stutter?

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:59.113
I'll get word to shotgun,

01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:00.948
tell him shit's on
hold until I'm out.

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.217
Good answer.

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:56.971
Who is?

01:22:56.973 --> 01:22:59.239
It's money.
Open the door.

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:21.562
Howie's been calling you
all day. What the fuck?

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:23.764
Let's go!

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.101
The fuck you mean
he's been calling?

01:23:27.103 --> 01:23:28.302
He ain't been
calling- oh, fuck!

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:31.672
Aaahhh!!

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.540
Fuck!

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:49.590
What you tell kutcher?

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.561
Does Herman know you're a rat?

01:23:54.563 --> 01:23:56.530
Fucking stupid motherfucker!

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:58.732
Herman's the one who tried
to kill you, you fuck!

01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:02.469
No, you both did, or his crew
wouldn't have known I was there.

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:10.344
Go on and do what you gotta do.

01:24:10.346 --> 01:24:12.279
Go ahead.

01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:14.081
Go on and fucking do it.

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:17.785
Come on, fucking do it!

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:38.272
I ain't a-i ain't no punk.

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:12.439
Yeah. Anything?

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:15.576
Nothing.
It's almost four o'clock, too.

01:25:15.578 --> 01:25:17.377
All right, I'll
check in on shotgun.

01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:19.847
There's no need to tip harlon
off if we don't have to.

01:25:19.849 --> 01:25:22.516
-Okay, standing by.
-Copy that.

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:11.632
Frank, it's kutcher!

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:16.203
Frank!

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:03.417
Fuck!

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.555
Get in that room now.

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:20.734
Fuck!

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:25.505
Yeah.

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:28.609
Yeah, he left his cell
here, but he's fucking gone.

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:32.813
Hang on a minute.
Hang on.

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:39.720
Hang on.

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:50.330
Somebody in this deal thinks
shotgun's still alive, man.

01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:51.999
He texted them the
coordinates at 11:00.

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:16.083
Still can't track the
incoming calls to shotgun's.

01:29:16.085 --> 01:29:17.718
Must be off.

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.920
Fucking text better come
through, or we're screwed.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:02.896
Where's shotgun?

01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:05.632
You tell me. Went to pick him
up, he's a fucking no-show!

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:06.466
I'll call him.

01:30:06.468 --> 01:30:08.969
Yeah, you do that.
I can't do babysitting.

01:30:08.971 --> 01:30:10.504
Let's go. Give me the key.

01:30:19.448 --> 01:30:20.480
That's shotgun's.

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:24.484
It's a different number. 714.

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:46.873
Look at the Russian
serial numbers.

01:30:46.875 --> 01:30:50.143
And the glocks from
Austria, not the U.S.

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:55.048
Totally untraceable.

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:55.982
Nice.

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:57.918
Shotgun's still not answering.

01:31:01.522 --> 01:31:03.990
Pull your cell batteries,
in case he got pinched.

01:31:03.992 --> 01:31:06.726
You two, you ride in the back,
since you're both validated.

01:31:06.728 --> 01:31:07.861
Let's load up.

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:28.081
Well, our ci's dead.

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:31.251
Harlon's fucking Mia.
How was your day?

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:34.855
All right, so what do you wanna
do, hit the Indian casinos

01:31:34.857 --> 01:31:37.023
or what, you got a plan b?

01:31:37.025 --> 01:31:39.059
Because atf ain't
heard shit either.

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:42.863
A different cell called our
cis, what, two hours ago?

01:31:42.865 --> 01:31:45.832
We located it in moreno valley,
then it fucking disappeared too.

01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:47.767
Cockroaches are making moves.

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:58.912
Horvath caught back-up.

01:31:58.914 --> 01:32:00.213
He's right behind us.

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:02.249
What time is it now?

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:06.119
Eight minutes to eleven.

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:20.133
Yo, we're in business! Yo!

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:24.237
The original incoming cell just
passed palm desert on the 10.

01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:26.039
It's 10:54 now.

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.275
If we can just get the exact
location, we can set up on them.

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:38.018
Here.

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:48.028
About five miles out.

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:01.841
Got it.

01:33:01.843 --> 01:33:04.878
Let's go, we got the
coordinates! Let's ride out!

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:06.947
All right, load up!

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.654
It's half a mile up that way.

01:33:14.656 --> 01:33:16.790
All right, turn in and stop.

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:31.771
Turn your cell back
on, post up out here.

01:33:31.773 --> 01:33:33.206
Text me if you see anything.

01:33:33.208 --> 01:33:34.641
Will do.

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.361
Let me see your gun.

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:01.201
Keep driving.

01:34:01.203 --> 01:34:03.703
What! What's wrong, money?

01:34:03.705 --> 01:34:06.172
How many guns did you tell
shotgun you had total?

01:34:06.174 --> 01:34:07.874
Same as I told you!

01:34:07.876 --> 01:34:09.943
You lie to me again, I'll
blow your fucking head off!

01:34:09.945 --> 01:34:11.177
How many?

01:34:11.179 --> 01:34:14.914
Two. Two thousand aks.

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:18.284
Shotgun, right before
i met you, shotgun said

01:34:18.286 --> 01:34:20.887
that if I said anything
about the extra guns,

01:34:20.889 --> 01:34:23.156
he'd green-light me,
money. You gotta believe me.

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:24.324
Where are they?

01:34:24.326 --> 01:34:26.159
Shotgun's dead, isn't he?

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:28.228
Answer the fucking question.

01:34:28.230 --> 01:34:32.399
Second storage unit, number 246.

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.935
Does chopper or the others know?

01:34:35.937 --> 01:34:38.905
No. Shotgun and
i went out alone.

01:34:57.892 --> 01:34:59.759
This is what you're gonna do.

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:03.196
You're gonna forget
they're there...

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:06.766
And you're gonna fucking vanish.

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:10.336
Re-enlist, I don't
care what you do.

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:14.741
But if I ever hear
your name again...

01:35:14.743 --> 01:35:17.077
There won't be
anywhere you can hide.

01:35:17.079 --> 01:35:19.379
Do you understand me?
Do you understand?

01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:21.281
Yes. Yes.

01:35:25.119 --> 01:35:26.186
Jump.

01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:29.923
-But--
-open the door and jump.

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:46.566
Where's Howie?

01:36:46.568 --> 01:36:50.036
Dropped him off strapped quarter
mile back. Watch our six.

01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:52.572
Keep your eyes open.

01:37:04.852 --> 01:37:06.085
That's them.

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:12.859
Looking for shotgun?

01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:16.429
I know it was only business.

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:19.365
Just pick a better
shooter next time.

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:21.000
Orale.

01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:24.370
You should'a seen me crack
the whip on those fools.

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:30.343
What you don't know is you
made a deal with a rat.

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:34.180
He was gonna throw you
under the bus with me.

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:40.053
Has that been taken care of?

01:37:40.055 --> 01:37:43.189
-And the youngster who
stashed the extra guns.

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:46.059
Don't worry, I know
where they're hidden.

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:52.165
I figure, we make everyone
happy with this deal...

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:56.502
Then you and I split the rest.

01:38:02.977 --> 01:38:04.978
-I'm down with that.

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:26.266
Orale.

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:30.236
Tienes todas las armas?

01:38:30.238 --> 01:38:31.170
Simón.

01:38:31.672 --> 01:38:34.173
Aj, carga los cohetes.

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:38.378
Chopper, move the truck around.
You got the money?

01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:40.246
Un millón cinco.

01:38:40.248 --> 01:38:41.347
All right.

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:06.539
Get down! Get down!
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:12.412
Fuck, homie!
The flaca's dog!

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:23.289
Hands on your back!
Don't move!

01:39:38.105 --> 01:39:39.272
Drop the weapon!

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:42.275
He's got a gun!

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:44.410
Look away look away!!

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:46.346
Hands behind your back.

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:51.210
We're officially validating you.
Means you'll do the rest of your

01:40:51.212 --> 01:40:53.546
new life term here in the shu-
unless you wanna play ball.

01:40:53.548 --> 01:40:55.681
-Got nothing to play.
-Come on, harlon.

01:40:55.683 --> 01:40:57.050
Don't let your pride
get in the way.

01:40:57.052 --> 01:40:57.050
You don't owe these people--

01:40:57.052 --> 01:41:00.420
-save the speech.
We're done here.

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:20.073
What happens when we put you in
death row with all the low-lifes

01:41:20.075 --> 01:41:21.674
for murdering shotgun?

01:41:21.676 --> 01:41:23.543
Cause when it happens,
and it will...

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:27.180
Whatever offer me and my
guys are willing to make

01:41:27.182 --> 01:41:28.448
goes up in smoke.

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:33.820
That all you got?

01:41:34.388 --> 01:41:35.721
Bluffs?

01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:40.793
I already pleaded
guilty to the guns.

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:43.563
Let me do my time like a man.

01:41:43.565 --> 01:41:45.498
You see, that's
what I don't get.

01:41:46.733 --> 01:41:49.102
I've been around long enough
to know when a con's making

01:41:49.104 --> 01:41:51.437
moves simply to survive or
when it's that rare breed...

01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:55.341
The one that relishes
in the power.

01:41:55.343 --> 01:41:57.210
But that's not you.

01:41:57.212 --> 01:41:59.479
Not by a long shot.

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:02.115
Why you throwing
your whole life away?

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:08.121
Look, I don't know what
they're holding over you...

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:12.125
But I can offer you
something better.

01:42:12.626 --> 01:42:14.127
Something real.

01:42:15.562 --> 01:42:17.530
No bluffs, no bs.

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:20.800
You give me the beast...

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:23.703
And everyone involved...

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:25.771
And you walk.

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:31.410
I mean it.

01:42:31.412 --> 01:42:33.913
No protective custody,
no reduced sentence.

01:42:33.915 --> 01:42:35.448
Out.

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:37.683
Back in the free world.

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:41.254
Back with Katherine and Joshua.

01:42:41.256 --> 01:42:43.222
Nothing out there is free.

01:42:43.224 --> 01:42:46.359
Especially for a rat with
a target on his back.

01:42:46.361 --> 01:42:48.895
You know, harlon, when
i walk outta here...

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.198
The deal walks with me, man.

01:42:54.301 --> 01:42:56.202
Have a nice trip.

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:02.241
All right.

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:05.211
Good luck in here.

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.344
Come on, money.

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:00.993
Easy.

01:45:01.695 --> 01:45:02.828
Right there.

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:34.727
Now that we're
looking eye to eye...

01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:36.796
You're gonna answer something.

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:40.566
Shotgun's body was discovered
around five o'clock

01:45:40.568 --> 01:45:42.568
which means there's no way he
could've tipped off the cops

01:45:42.570 --> 01:45:44.870
with the location since
Herman didn't send you

01:45:44.872 --> 01:45:47.807
the coordinates until an
hour before the meet.

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:50.810
So explain to me how three
different agencies had time to

01:45:50.812 --> 01:45:53.079
set up and take everyone down.

01:46:00.854 --> 01:46:02.888
I gave you a gift...

01:46:04.624 --> 01:46:06.359
And you spit in my face.

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:11.397
How does it feel to
be the walking dead?

01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:15.434
No different than
the last 10 years.

01:46:15.436 --> 01:46:17.536
Oh, we'll see about that...

01:46:18.705 --> 01:46:21.440
When your old lady and
kid are lying in blood

01:46:21.442 --> 01:46:23.542
and you get to live with
knowing you're the cause.

01:46:23.544 --> 01:46:25.911
Get this lame away from me!

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.558
Cuff up, money.

01:46:42.396 --> 01:46:44.063
Cuff up, money.

01:47:15.195 --> 01:47:16.562
Okay, money.

01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:24.970
Okay!

01:47:28.074 --> 01:47:29.675
All right, easy!

01:47:31.711 --> 01:47:32.578
Easy.

01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.480
Drop your radio.

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:35.848
Easy.

01:47:36.683 --> 01:47:38.451
Easy, money.

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:41.086
Slowly.

01:47:51.998 --> 01:47:53.732
What the fuck, money?

01:47:57.604 --> 01:47:59.538
You knew they'd
put you back here.

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:02.975
That's why you lead
the cops to the bust...

01:48:03.877 --> 01:48:05.578
To get to me.

01:48:08.715 --> 01:48:10.149
Well played.

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:14.653
Let's get down, wood.

01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:06.205
Nobody's touching my family.

01:49:57.123 --> 01:49:59.224
We're gonna get a few
things straight here.

01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:04.363
I'm already doing life...

01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:08.133
So I could give a shit
about additional time.

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:13.172
But I'm not sitting on
death row waiting to be put

01:50:13.174 --> 01:50:15.074
down like some animal.

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:19.144
So you write it up that
he attacked me with the

01:50:19.146 --> 01:50:23.248
blade first. In return, your
arrangement with us stands...

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:26.885
Including the monthly
deposits into your account.

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:31.857
Reason I can guarantee
these terms is...

01:50:34.928 --> 01:50:36.762
I'm running the show now.

01:50:44.938 --> 01:50:46.271
Say it.

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.645
You're running the show.

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:39.258
Pop the battery and
break the sim card.

01:51:49.402 --> 01:51:51.203
You gotta be shitting me.

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:54.139
I still don't get this guy.

01:51:56.076 --> 01:51:57.910
But I fucking like him.

01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:25.237
Got some mail, money.

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:31.043
Thanks.

01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:14.386
Mom told me you've
gotten life without parole now.

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:18.090
I don't think I'll ever
understand why any of this has

01:53:18.092 --> 01:53:22.394
happened but I wanted you to
know that I've accepted reality

01:53:23.329 --> 01:53:26.031
which is why I will do what
you've asked me in your letter.

01:53:27.801 --> 01:53:29.568
I'm moving on with my life, dad.

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:33.138
I will learn from
your mistakes...

01:53:34.274 --> 01:53:36.975
And I will always
be mom's protector.

01:53:38.178 --> 01:53:40.045
But most importantly...

01:53:40.814 --> 01:53:42.414
I want you to know...

01:53:43.049 --> 01:53:44.483
That I've forgiven you.

01:53:45.852 --> 01:53:47.986
Your son, Josh.
