WEBVTT

00:03.333 --> 00:05.500
(Ryan) Previously on Mech-X4...

00:05.583 --> 00:06.792
That's the last of it.

00:08.125 --> 00:10.959
(distorted) I... need... power.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.125
-(Ryan) Did we do that?
-(Leo) No.

00:15.208 --> 00:16.333
No, that was something else.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.959
-You've got to get back to Bay City!
- We're on our way!

00:26.750 --> 00:29.208
(Harris) The city's power grid
is out of control!

00:29.291 --> 00:31.125
What's going on?

00:32.208 --> 00:34.083
(sirens wailing in distance)

00:35.375 --> 00:37.083
(Harris)
The whole power grid is glitching.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.583
It's crazy out there!

00:40.667 --> 00:43.000
-Any theories?
-No. Leo's trying to figure it out.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.917
One second everything's fine, the next,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.125
there's some sort of weird power surge.

00:47.208 --> 00:49.208
-Do you think it could be--
-Grey? Yeah, maybe.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.166
Or... okay?

00:51.250 --> 00:52.959
It could be a squirrel.

00:53.041 --> 00:56.166
They nibble on a few power lines and boom!

00:56.250 --> 00:57.583
It's blackout.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.208
Spyder could be right.

00:59.291 --> 01:00.375
It might not be Grey.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.125
"Spyder could be right."

01:02.208 --> 01:04.250
So, this, um, this is
what dignity feels like.

01:06.291 --> 01:07.959
It's okay!

01:08.041 --> 01:09.583
(loud rumbling)

01:10.458 --> 01:12.250
(rumbling continuing)

01:17.291 --> 01:18.625
That came from the power plant!

01:18.709 --> 01:20.500
The city lost all of its power!

01:20.583 --> 01:22.500
No squirrel did this.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.208
(theme song playing)

01:59.083 --> 02:01.792
I'm scanning the city
for power fluctuations.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.333
It looks like all the buildings
that have power

02:04.417 --> 02:06.500
-are running off generators.
-(console chimes)

02:06.583 --> 02:08.166
Hold on.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.959
Picking up a strange reading coming at--

02:12.083 --> 02:13.542
Veracity's house?

02:13.625 --> 02:15.792
-That's weird.
-What's weird?

02:15.875 --> 02:17.792
Other than you scanning a girl's house.

02:17.875 --> 02:20.166
And that you apparently know
Veracity's address by heart.

02:20.250 --> 02:22.625
I scanned every house in the city!

02:22.709 --> 02:24.625
Statistically, some of those
are girls' houses.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.000
Super creepy.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.625
Her house has more power
than any building in the entire city.

02:30.709 --> 02:32.000
Okay, you guys go there

02:32.083 --> 02:33.875
and figure out why
her house still has power.

02:33.959 --> 02:36.625
Maybe it can help us find out
how to restore power to the city.

02:36.709 --> 02:39.917
And in case Grey or Harper is behind this,
we need to get the power back on.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.709
Are you sure sending
Harris is a good idea?

02:42.792 --> 02:44.542
Since he and Veracity
are a few weapons away

02:44.625 --> 02:45.667
from a duel to the death.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.166
We work together when we have to!

02:47.250 --> 02:48.792
We're frenemies. You guys get that!

02:48.875 --> 02:50.291
-No, no.
-Weird way to put it.

02:51.417 --> 02:54.041
We got to go to the power plant
and see if Grey's behind this.

03:03.208 --> 03:04.583
(humming)

03:04.667 --> 03:06.125
(Ryan) All right! No one's around.

03:09.792 --> 03:11.458
Let's see what's going on.

03:11.542 --> 03:12.917
You seem different.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.083
Like... just less uptight.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.917
Yeah! I guess I am.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.500
Meeting my birth father took
a huge weight off my shoulders.

03:19.583 --> 03:20.959
Was he cool?
When do I meet him?

03:21.041 --> 03:24.000
I wish you could now,
but... it's not safe,

03:24.083 --> 03:27.041
as long as there's people out there
that can use him against us.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.041
All right, well, let's get these guys.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.917
Because the sooner your dad is safe,

03:33.875 --> 03:37.542
the sooner he gets to know
that you're Mark Walker's little brother.

03:38.041 --> 03:39.500
(chuckles)

03:39.583 --> 03:42.625
Yeah, I don't know how he went
that long without knowing that.

03:42.709 --> 03:44.208
(scoffs) Me either, man.

03:46.291 --> 03:48.625
-(Spyder) Veracity's having a party.
-(Harris) A party?

03:48.709 --> 03:51.291
(pop music playing)

03:53.750 --> 03:56.208
(lively chattering)

04:02.458 --> 04:03.917
It is a party!

04:04.417 --> 04:06.875
This is my first high school party.

04:07.834 --> 04:09.417
(girl) Hey!

04:10.291 --> 04:11.875
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

04:11.959 --> 04:14.458
She didn't invite us to her party?

04:15.083 --> 04:17.166
This is inappropriate frenemy behavior.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.917
Harris, I know you're hurting,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.500
and I want to be there for you...

04:21.625 --> 04:22.750
but party!

04:26.667 --> 04:28.458
Yo! Yo! Rock out!

04:36.500 --> 04:38.125
(clears throat)

04:39.041 --> 04:40.417
Oh, great.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.333
You're here, too. Bad to worse.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.834
Thanks for the invite, Her-Whiney Granger.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.792
-Nice.
-Thanks. Been working on that.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.250
But do you really think
I invited all of these people?

04:49.333 --> 04:52.208
Do I look like the "I want strangers
trashing my house" type?

04:56.125 --> 04:57.375
Whoo!

04:59.125 --> 05:01.000
No, that's a bit out of your character.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.667
They were at a party down the street,

05:02.750 --> 05:04.500
and when the blackout hit,
they just moved,

05:04.583 --> 05:06.583
and followed my lights
and planted the party here,

05:06.667 --> 05:09.667
like an unstoppable swarm of insects.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.375
But just dumber, much dumber.

05:12.834 --> 05:16.041
My dads are gonna kill me.
They're gonna kill me.

05:19.375 --> 05:21.041
(Wade) Whoo-hoo!

05:21.125 --> 05:22.500
What are you doing?

05:22.583 --> 05:24.750
Wow! Hey, guys!

05:24.834 --> 05:27.041
I found the dad clothes!

05:27.125 --> 05:29.709
(Crowd chanting):
Dad clothes! Dad clothes!

05:29.792 --> 05:31.500
Dad clothes! Dad clothes!

05:31.583 --> 05:33.291
(fabric rips)

05:33.375 --> 05:35.667
(chanting continues)

05:37.542 --> 05:40.125
Oh, man. I was gonna do that.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.625
-Oh, no, no, no, no.
-Whoa.

05:46.583 --> 05:47.750
What's in this case?

05:47.834 --> 05:50.166
-Is this keeping your power on?
-Hold it, spark plug.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.834
Why would I show it to you?

05:52.917 --> 05:55.709
Uh, because we're both
brilliant scientific minds?

05:55.792 --> 05:57.834
Eh, mine's a little bit
more brilliant than yours.

05:57.917 --> 06:00.375
-Is there a curve now?
-There's a little bit of a curve.

06:00.458 --> 06:04.500
(Spyder shouting)
Party people in the house!

06:05.291 --> 06:07.625
-Okay! Whoo!
-(music ends)

06:08.583 --> 06:12.667
Party people slightly
further away in the house!

06:12.750 --> 06:14.000
Okay.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.792
How 'bout this?

06:15.875 --> 06:18.917
I let Spyder off the leash
and let him clear out the party,

06:19.000 --> 06:20.667
and you show me how this thing works.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.959
How's Spyder gonna get
all these people to leave?

06:25.208 --> 06:27.083
(slow music playing)

06:27.166 --> 06:28.458
(Spyder) Oh, yeah.

06:29.583 --> 06:31.959
Dancing with myself. Awesome.

06:32.041 --> 06:35.166
Got it. Make it so.

06:36.542 --> 06:38.917
Hey, Spyder.
Someone in the other room says

06:39.000 --> 06:40.709
you can't fit your fist in your mouth.

06:40.792 --> 06:42.125
-What?!
-(music ends)

06:42.208 --> 06:44.041
Where's the butter? Where's the butter?

06:52.375 --> 06:54.083
It's so weird.

06:54.166 --> 06:55.625
Nothing's busted.

06:55.709 --> 06:57.375
No sign of a monster attack.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.000
Maybe Grey's not behind this.

07:00.709 --> 07:02.917
Yeah. About that?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.667
(liquid dripping)

07:10.834 --> 07:13.208
-(pop music playing)
-(lively chatter)

07:17.583 --> 07:19.333
Oh, yeah! Okay. Perfect.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.291
Mm! So good!

07:21.375 --> 07:23.375
I've been bare-handing
this bad boy all night.

07:23.458 --> 07:25.041
-Oh.
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.542
Whoo!

07:26.625 --> 07:29.125
Hey guys, this is, uh, this is J.J.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.834
He's got a lot of opinions

07:30.917 --> 07:33.792
on what's wrong with our generation,
so take it away, J.J.

07:34.709 --> 07:37.500
You all need to eat more corn.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.709
This country was built on corn!

07:46.041 --> 07:47.625
(feedback whines)

07:55.041 --> 07:56.959
(bass thumps)

08:01.500 --> 08:03.417
-(boy) Ow! My ears.
-(Spyder) Well!

08:03.500 --> 08:05.542
Who wants to talk
about our changing bodies?

08:05.625 --> 08:08.041
-I'm out of here!
-It's completely normal though.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.291
It's completely all a hundred percent...

08:12.917 --> 08:15.250
That's a lot of ooze.
It's definitely a monster.

08:15.333 --> 08:18.291
But what was it doing?
Why didn't it destroy anything?

08:18.375 --> 08:19.834
(electricity crackling)

08:23.166 --> 08:24.750
Hey look!

08:24.834 --> 08:26.625
The monster was drilling
into this reactor.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.250
You think it was stealing the power?

08:29.333 --> 08:31.917
A monster is sucking up energy?

08:32.500 --> 08:34.792
Then the one place in town
with the most energy...

08:34.875 --> 08:36.291
is Veracity's house!

08:39.667 --> 08:41.208
Okay! Wrap it up!

08:41.291 --> 08:43.583
I don't know where you're going,
but you can't stay here.

08:43.667 --> 08:47.709
Oh, FYI: The yellow punch
was not originally yellow, so...

08:47.792 --> 08:49.792
(whirring)

08:49.875 --> 08:50.917
A potato?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.083
One part potato generator,

08:52.166 --> 08:55.500
one part turbine-powered
by the Earth's magnetic field.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.583
It's got enough power for two weeks,
that's why I can't just turn it off.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.083
(Spyder) Yep, hi. I'm Spyder.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.834
Yeah, okay, as promised,
I will not call any of you.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.250
But my number is there
if you, uh, if you need it.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.583
That Spyder guy ruined the party.

09:08.291 --> 09:10.709
But it's still hilarious
we took over some nobody's house.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.250
Um...

09:15.166 --> 09:18.542
Yeah, uh...
so it charges things wirelessly.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.542
-And if you turn... Yeah.
-Hey.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.834
It's amazing.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.709
Look, don't let that Wade guy get to you.

09:26.792 --> 09:29.667
Like, I've seen him walk
into sliding-glass doors.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.542
-Multiple times.
-(Spyder) Let's go!

09:32.625 --> 09:34.792
-I saw him eat a rock once.
-(Spyder) Bye-bye.

09:34.875 --> 09:38.834
That's, like, the end of the story.
He just ate a rock for no reason.

09:38.917 --> 09:40.959
All right, I should go clean up.

09:41.041 --> 09:44.000
You can charge anything
you want, but just do it here.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.875
-All right? Cool.
-Okay.

09:49.834 --> 09:51.250
(distant roaring)

09:51.333 --> 09:52.667
What was that?

09:52.750 --> 09:55.583
(screeching)

09:55.667 --> 09:57.542
It's... Oh, man.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.542
(screeching)

10:10.875 --> 10:12.250
(roars)

10:12.333 --> 10:14.583
(electricity warbling)

10:19.000 --> 10:20.792
We have to warn Ryan!

10:20.875 --> 10:22.125
What is going on?

10:22.208 --> 10:23.291
Whoa.

10:33.417 --> 10:34.959
(monster roars)

10:35.041 --> 10:36.583
Can you turn on Spyder's weapons?

10:36.667 --> 10:38.709
The entire control panel is sticky.

10:38.792 --> 10:42.041
-Why is it stealing electricity?
-Why is this control panel sticky?

10:43.709 --> 10:44.792
(roars)

10:47.667 --> 10:49.333
(screams)

10:56.041 --> 10:57.750
(grunts)

11:04.166 --> 11:05.625
It's coming back!

11:06.583 --> 11:07.792
(roars)

11:10.166 --> 11:11.583
(screeches)

11:16.750 --> 11:18.583
Let's take down... Bug-osaur!

11:18.667 --> 11:20.417
Bug-osaur! Bug-osaur? Is that...?

11:20.500 --> 11:22.291
The Mosquito... dactyl?

11:22.375 --> 11:24.417
Insecta...

11:24.500 --> 11:26.834
You know, we're gonna let
Spyder name it after we kill it!

11:30.750 --> 11:32.041
(screeches)

11:32.125 --> 11:33.709
(screams)

11:33.792 --> 11:35.333
-(groans)
-Ryan!

11:35.417 --> 11:36.750
I'm okay.

11:37.583 --> 11:38.792
(monster growls)

11:44.041 --> 11:46.417
(power whines)

11:50.792 --> 11:52.792
Did that thing just suck out
Mech-X4's power?

11:52.875 --> 11:54.083
You are sharp.

12:00.625 --> 12:02.375
That's all the energy we need.

12:03.917 --> 12:05.959
(distorted) Time to come home.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.792
We need to get to the robot.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.917
Just... one thing first.

12:19.041 --> 12:20.375
Guys, are you seeing this?

12:24.542 --> 12:25.709
Harris.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.834
(whirring)

12:32.625 --> 12:35.834
Wow. Still generating power
even after the monster attack.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.417
Can we use it to jumpstart the robot?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.000
-I'm not sure.
-Hello!

12:39.083 --> 12:40.625
(all screaming)

12:40.709 --> 12:42.250
Where did you come from?

12:42.333 --> 12:44.125
There was darkness
everywhere, Ryan.

12:44.208 --> 12:46.208
-I fell asleep on a park bench.
-I hear that.

12:46.291 --> 12:48.291
Guys, the robot
is almost completely drained.

12:48.375 --> 12:49.917
Thanks, Mark. Awesome update.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.834
That's okay. We can recharge it.

12:51.917 --> 12:56.208
And this beautifully crafted generator
will do the trick!

12:56.375 --> 12:58.583
(chuckles) Amazing!

12:58.667 --> 13:00.917
You finally did it, Spyder.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.250
(all stammering)

13:02.333 --> 13:05.000
You proved yourself a worthy
and valuable member of the team.

13:05.083 --> 13:08.333
-Yes, he did!
-I... did not build that.

13:08.417 --> 13:10.375
-Oh.
-I did help steal it though.

13:10.458 --> 13:13.083
Well... at least you're consistent.

13:13.166 --> 13:17.375
Anyways, I should be able to get
everything online in a few hours.

13:17.417 --> 13:20.125
A few hours?
We need to find that monster now.

13:20.208 --> 13:23.709
Well, I could really ramp things up
if I had another potato.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.166
Let's-- Oh! Look at that.

13:25.250 --> 13:28.792
-Another potato!
-Why would you have a potato?

13:28.875 --> 13:31.208
How are we gonna track
a monster without a robot?

13:31.291 --> 13:33.834
It's a big, glowing mosquito
in the middle of a blackout.

13:33.917 --> 13:35.959
-We can find it.
-Whoa! Hold on.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.417
You can't just chase down
a monster on foot.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.834
That monster's carrying all
the city's power somewhere.

13:40.917 --> 13:43.917
We have to follow it, see where it goes,
and then come back with Mech-X4.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.333
What if you run into Grey?
She's, you know, super strong.

13:47.417 --> 13:50.041
Mech links. Antidote darts.

13:50.125 --> 13:52.792
Guys, we can take her down.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.333
She's been messing with us
since we started high school.

13:56.417 --> 13:59.667
With her gone, we're one step closer
to having normal lives.

14:00.959 --> 14:03.667
That was very emotionally stirring, Ryan.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.709
I'm really glad I woke up for that.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.083
Okay! I'll get the robot up working
as soon as possible.

14:09.166 --> 14:12.041
And we need to get out there
before we lose sight of the monster.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.500
(Ryan)
I can still see it! Over that ridge!

14:15.583 --> 14:17.083
So we're doing this low-tech?

14:17.166 --> 14:18.792
Eh, think of it as old-school.

14:18.875 --> 14:21.125
We destroyed our old school.
This is gonna be awesome.

14:21.208 --> 14:24.667
We're gonna catch Grey,
and... hey, Ptero-squito!

14:25.333 --> 14:27.792
-Nice!
-And that's why he names the monsters.

14:34.125 --> 14:36.417
(roars)

14:43.917 --> 14:45.417
(electricity crackling)

14:57.875 --> 14:59.250
(beeping)

15:02.083 --> 15:04.125
(machine chirping)

15:06.500 --> 15:07.875
(gasps)

15:08.917 --> 15:10.458
Now!

15:10.542 --> 15:11.917
(Ptero-squito roaring)

15:12.000 --> 15:13.250
(alarm blaring)

15:17.250 --> 15:19.834
(electricity crackling)

15:23.792 --> 15:25.375
Is that thing made of ooze?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.625
Whatever it is, it's not good
and we have to stop her.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.625
And we have to take that thing
out before it's fully charged.

15:33.208 --> 15:36.834
Grey! Whatever you're doing, it stops now!

15:39.583 --> 15:41.709
(distorted) You're too late!

15:43.041 --> 15:45.041
-She's running!
-Should we run?

15:47.917 --> 15:49.542
(crackling)

15:53.875 --> 15:55.667
(explosion)

16:00.250 --> 16:02.000
(screeches)

16:08.667 --> 16:09.834
(groans)

16:19.208 --> 16:22.875
Is this... form correct?

16:25.542 --> 16:29.125
Have I taken a proper form
so you will recognize me

16:29.208 --> 16:30.375
as your ruler?

16:31.041 --> 16:33.041
I don't like the way that dude's talking.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.458
Ryan, this guy's power readings
are off the chart.

16:36.542 --> 16:39.709
You will address me by my name, human.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.417
Traegar.

16:48.250 --> 16:51.750
You will address me as Traegar.

16:53.750 --> 16:54.834
Okay.

16:54.917 --> 16:57.125
(muttering)

16:58.750 --> 17:00.500
Okay.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.208
(grunts)

17:04.291 --> 17:05.375
Okay. Hook up the potato.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.625
Now, this is super dangerous,
so I better protect myself.

17:08.709 --> 17:10.250
Um... ah!

17:10.709 --> 17:12.125
Well.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
Good enough. Okay.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.709
(electricity crackles)

17:16.792 --> 17:18.792
-(power rumbles)
-Yeah! Whoo!

17:18.875 --> 17:20.333
Hot potato! That's right!

17:20.417 --> 17:23.333
(electricity crackling)

17:24.417 --> 17:26.625
-(beeping)
-The robot's ready.

17:27.458 --> 17:28.959
Then let's not take any chances.

17:33.625 --> 17:34.792
Come on!

17:43.417 --> 17:45.041
-(whooshing)
-Yeah, son!

17:50.458 --> 17:52.834
Let's squash this thing back
into the ooze it came from!

18:22.333 --> 18:24.041
-(beeping)
-What is that?

18:24.125 --> 18:27.291
When Ryan's done crushing it,
gum on our boot.

18:30.625 --> 18:32.250
(grunts)

18:34.291 --> 18:37.417
(grunting, panting)

18:39.834 --> 18:40.875
How is it stopping us?

18:40.959 --> 18:42.542
-Is that possible?
-Come on, stomp it.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.917
I'm trying. I can't move my leg!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.125
I need more power.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.500
I'm all out of potatoes.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.875
-(explosion)
-Whoo!

18:54.875 --> 18:56.291
(rumbling)

18:58.041 --> 18:59.500
(metal scrapes)

19:04.375 --> 19:05.542
(grunts)

19:10.458 --> 19:13.125
(alarm wailing)

19:21.166 --> 19:23.709
Come on, guys.
We got to get back in this fight.

19:25.166 --> 19:26.208
(grunts)

19:34.583 --> 19:36.625
(panting) It's gone.

19:36.709 --> 19:40.291
Oh, good. I mean,
that guy was way out of our league.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.959
He threw us like a chew toy.
Guys, come on.

19:44.041 --> 19:47.000
I don't understand.
Why not just waste us now?

19:47.792 --> 19:49.750
Because whatever it's planning,

19:49.834 --> 19:52.417
it's a lot bigger
than just beating up Mech-X4.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.208
What was that?

19:54.291 --> 19:56.208
He said his name was Traegar.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.583
And I have no idea how to stop him.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.625
(sighs)

20:10.709 --> 20:14.250
Seriously?! I specifically told you
not to take it out of the house.

20:14.333 --> 20:15.959
We had a few things to charge,

20:16.041 --> 20:18.125
so I tried to max it out
with an Idaho russet.

20:18.208 --> 20:22.125
An Idaho russet? Oh!
You could have destroyed the city.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.250
-I-- I thought that we were frenemies--
-We are.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.583
Kind of.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.709
(Spyder) It'd just make
my life a whole lot easier,

20:27.792 --> 20:29.166
if you two just got along.

20:29.250 --> 20:30.709
-Highly doubtful.
-No. No.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.917
Well, then you asked for it.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.041
-(romantic music plays)
-Mm-mm!

20:36.125 --> 20:38.250
-Dude, no.
-Please stop.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.625
-(Spyder) Oh, yeah!
-That's... very disturbing.

20:40.709 --> 20:42.417
You know what to do.

20:44.291 --> 20:45.625
I'm sorry.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.583
Accepted.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.959
I build bridges.

20:52.583 --> 20:54.709
-And so you know we're serious...
-Oh, yes. Okay.

20:56.375 --> 20:57.834
(whirring)

21:00.417 --> 21:02.458
Okay. You're trying.

21:02.542 --> 21:04.250
(Spyder chuckles)

21:05.250 --> 21:06.417
Come on!

21:06.500 --> 21:08.000
(Spyder) I'll try on the dad clothes.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.000
-(Harris) No, you're not!
-(Spyder) Yes, I am!

21:11.875 --> 21:13.417
Why didn't you end them?

21:13.500 --> 21:16.208
They're mosquitoes.
I can swat them whenever I want.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.083
But we had them right there, and--

21:19.291 --> 21:20.917
You are like me,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.500
empowered by the gel.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.959
And that gel is mine to control.

21:26.625 --> 21:28.333
I feel a debt to you.

21:28.834 --> 21:31.000
But do not forget your place!

21:33.291 --> 21:34.917
(panting)

21:36.458 --> 21:37.875
So, what's next?

21:39.166 --> 21:42.583
Next, we do that which I was born to do.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.208
Make this world my own.

21:52.959 --> 21:55.208
(theme music playing)

22:18.041 --> 22:19.166
(barks)
