09:22.528 --> 09:26.797
Did we learn nothing
from <i>Planet of the Apes?</i>

09:26.799 --> 09:29.266
So how do I make this right
for Lyndsey?

09:29.268 --> 09:33.604
Oh. Maybe you could paint
a smiley face on her vagina.

09:35.106 --> 09:37.875
If she had one wish,
what would it be?

09:37.877 --> 09:39.343
To be married to him.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.945
Okay, that's probably true,

09:40.947 --> 09:43.514
but she can't have Walden.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.716
And make sure she knows that.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.818
But I think you might
be on the right track

09:47.820 --> 09:49.720
that she would
like a commitment.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.121
Wow... a commitment.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.726
For years, I-I felt
I should marry Lyndsey,

09:55.728 --> 09:58.262
but, uh, it's never
the right time.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.965
Maybe now is the right time.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.734
I just...

10:03.736 --> 10:07.238

for an engagement ring.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.242
I'm not getting you an
engagement ring and a Ferrari.

Really? Where'd you get
your engagement ring for your ex-wife?

10:29.907 --> 10:32.040
Well, when I met Judith,
I was working at a funeral home.

10:32.042 --> 10:33.241
I'll let you

Oh. You know, I...

Uh, uh, "Want a

11:01.805 --> 11:03.205
Uh, uh, how about this one?

11:03.207 --> 11:05.073
If you're gonna
get down on your knees,

11:05.075 --> 11:06.842
you better be giving a BJ.

11:08.312 --> 11:10.078
We've heard them all, sir.

11:11.581 --> 11:13.381
So, what can we do for you guys?

11:13.383 --> 11:15.383
Uh, well,
to celebrate our divorce,

11:15.385 --> 11:17.552
I'd like to get my ex-husband
an engagement ring

11:17.554 --> 11:19.454
for his on-again,
off-again girlfriend.

11:19.456 --> 11:22.057
Oh, and I might need your card,
in case I propose

11:22.059 --> 11:24.092
to my girlfriend,
his ex-girlfriend,

11:24.094 --> 11:26.361
our social worker.

11:27.763 --> 11:29.831
Also, do you validate?

11:29.833 --> 11:32.067
We do.
So, what kind of cut

11:32.069 --> 11:33.401
were you thinking?

11:33.403 --> 11:37.539
Oh, well, a-a cushion cut
is <i>très</i> in vogue right now.

11:37.541 --> 11:39.674
Oh, on the other hand,
ever since I was a little boy,

11:39.676 --> 11:41.409
I had my heart set
on a princess cut.

11:41.411 --> 11:43.512
I think that she's asking
what Lyndsey would like.

11:43.514 --> 11:46.915
Oh, uh, right, um,
uh, the bride, uh, Lyndsey.

11:46.917 --> 11:49.718
Um, uh, well, you know,
she has very common taste,

11:49.720 --> 11:51.786
so, you know, probably round.

11:54.457 --> 11:56.558
Well, what do you think
of these?

11:56.560 --> 11:58.894
They are both a minimum
of four carats each.

11:58.896 --> 12:01.029
Oh, and, uh,
how much are they?

12:01.031 --> 12:02.831
Oh, dear Lord!

12:02.833 --> 12:06.268
I think I just dropped
four carats in my pants.

12:06.270 --> 12:07.936
Don't worry about the price.

12:07.938 --> 12:09.170
Just get what you want.

12:09.172 --> 12:10.939
Wow. Lyndsey is very lucky

12:10.941 --> 12:13.375
to have a man like you
in my life.

12:14.544 --> 12:16.745
So, do you
see anything you like?

12:16.747 --> 12:18.747
They all look good under
these showroom lights.

12:18.749 --> 12:20.382
I need something
that looks good

12:20.384 --> 12:21.983
in a rent-controlled
apartment in Van Nuys.

12:21.985 --> 12:23.652
Then I suggest this one.

12:23.654 --> 12:24.719
It's flawless.

12:24.721 --> 12:27.856
Oh. Well,
I'll take it.

12:27.858 --> 12:29.524
It'll remind her of me.

12:29.526 --> 12:31.993
Why? Does the diamond
fart a lot?

12:33.496 --> 12:35.330
I'll just go wrap this up.

to let Lyndsey and I live

12:52.115 --> 12:53.682
I mean,
that'-that'd be ridiculous.

12:53.684 --> 12:55.317
Wouldn't it?

12:56.620 --> 12:58.053
Wouldn't it?

12:58.055 --> 13:01.990

do this more often.

Why are you telling
us what year it is?

13:18.976 --> 13:20.976

providing some context,

missed the subtitle.

but I hope you didn't do
anything as silly as waste

18:50.573 --> 18:52.540
your wish on ring...

18:52.542 --> 18:55.009
I'm a princess!
I'm a pretty, pretty princess!

18:55.011 --> 18:56.411
Is that a yes?

18:56.413 --> 18:58.112
Yes!
Ah!

18:59.581 --> 19:02.283
That is so sweet.

19:02.285 --> 19:04.585
It's so beautiful.
So moving.

19:04.587 --> 19:06.654
So... romantic.

19:06.656 --> 19:08.823
In fact... Ms. McMartin,

19:08.825 --> 19:10.692
will you...?
No.

19:10.694 --> 19:11.859
Right, it's too soon.

19:11.861 --> 19:13.428
Don't leave me.

19:13.430 --> 19:14.595
I'm so happy.

19:14.597 --> 19:16.130
This is really
a new beginning.

19:16.132 --> 19:19.400
It is. We get our own place,
our own things, new jobs...

19:19.402 --> 19:20.735
Oh, perfect.

19:20.737 --> 19:22.203
Started the day
with a Ferrari,

19:22.205 --> 19:25.340
ended it with a
wife and a job.

19:25.342 --> 19:27.508
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

19:33.453 --> 19:35.521
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

19:35.523 --> 19:37.089
Thanks again
for the engagement ring.

19:37.091 --> 19:38.958
Thanks for being
such a great friend.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.493
Oh, please.

19:40.495 --> 19:42.495
You gave me
a new lease on life.

19:42.497 --> 19:45.663
I mean, after we lost Charlie,
I thought we were done.

19:45.687 --> 19:46.667
We?

19:46.667 --> 19:50.469
Well, you know, me,
uh, Berta, Jake,

19:50.471 --> 19:52.471
my mom, Lyndsey,

19:52.473 --> 19:56.042
all the crazy characters who've
walked into this amazing house.

19:56.044 --> 19:59.445
Yeah, it's been a pretty
wacky last four years, huh?

19:59.447 --> 20:00.780
Yeah.

20:00.782 --> 20:01.947
Had a lot of laughs.

20:02.266 --> 20:05.868
Imagine how weird
it would be without the laughs.
