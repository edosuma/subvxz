WEBVTT

00:00.923 --> 00:02.860
Previously on
<i>The Big Bang Theory...</i>

00:02.924 --> 00:05.307
We were worried
about you.

00:05.309 --> 00:07.309
Don't be melodramatic.

00:07.311 --> 00:08.928
I'm just getting on a train

00:08.930 --> 00:11.096
and leaving forever.

00:11.098 --> 00:14.350
So a few things
don't go your way

00:14.352 --> 00:15.684
and your best
decision

00:15.686 --> 00:18.320
is to ride the
rails like a hobo?

00:18.322 --> 00:20.606
Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

00:20.608 --> 00:21.690
Everything
is changing,

00:21.692 --> 00:24.109
and it's simply too much.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.778
I need to get away and think.

00:25.780 --> 00:27.279
Sheldon...

00:27.281 --> 00:29.114
Yes?

00:29.116 --> 00:31.000
I'm gonna miss you.

00:31.002 --> 00:33.836
Of course you are.

00:35.372 --> 00:37.957
You just made
that easier.

00:41.928 --> 00:44.096
Excuse me.

00:46.917 --> 00:48.884
Is it at all possible

00:48.886 --> 00:51.136
that you're knitting
a pair of pants?

00:52.772 --> 00:55.057
Oh, well, no, you're
understandably terrified.

00:55.059 --> 00:57.693
But, you know,
allow me to explain.

00:57.695 --> 01:00.813
45 days ago, um,
I embarked on

01:00.815 --> 01:02.314
a railroad journey
of healing

01:02.316 --> 01:03.699
because my university

01:03.701 --> 01:05.316
was making me do
string theory,

01:05.319 --> 01:07.903
and my favorite comic
book store burned down,

01:07.905 --> 01:09.738
and when my roommate
got engaged,

01:09.740 --> 01:11.991
my girlfriend wanted
to move in with me,

01:11.993 --> 01:14.660
which was no doubt
a ploy just to see my--

01:14.662 --> 01:17.246
well, excuse my language,
but my bathing suit parts.

01:20.917 --> 01:22.885
Uh, sir, may I
use your phone?

01:22.887 --> 01:24.920
I don't think so.
Yeah, well,

01:24.922 --> 01:26.672
I understand that
I'm half naked,

01:26.674 --> 01:28.557
but there is
a reasonable explanation.

01:28.559 --> 01:31.176
While I slept
in my sleeper car,

01:31.178 --> 01:32.978
all my possessions were stolen.

01:32.980 --> 01:33.980
Now,

01:33.981 --> 01:35.648
typically,
I wear pajamas,

01:35.650 --> 01:39.518
but I recently adopted
a hobo lifestyle

01:39.520 --> 01:43.272
and pajamas are the
sleep-pants of the Man.

01:45.191 --> 01:48.243
I'll have you know,
Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants

01:48.245 --> 01:50.162
and a nation rallied behind him!

01:50.164 --> 01:52.147
My good man...

01:52.149 --> 01:53.499
Now, before you walk away...

01:53.501 --> 01:55.367
I know that I may
appear deranged,

01:55.369 --> 01:57.870
but I am, in fact,
a world-renowned physicist.

01:57.872 --> 02:01.290
Ask me the difference
between a boson and a fermion.

02:01.292 --> 02:02.508
Go ahead, ask!

02:05.128 --> 02:07.046
Bosons have integer spin,

02:07.048 --> 02:09.431
fermions have half-integer spin!

02:09.433 --> 02:10.716
My legs are getting cold!

02:10.717 --> 02:13.485
Why won't anybody help me?

02:41.859 --> 02:43.677
(sniffs)

02:43.679 --> 02:44.679
Morning.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.213
Hi. Want to do
yoga with me?

02:46.215 --> 02:47.898
Um, let me just have
some coffee first,

02:47.900 --> 02:50.033
and then I'll have
the strength to tell you

02:50.035 --> 02:52.369
how much I won't be doing that.

02:52.371 --> 02:55.255
(phone ringing)

02:55.257 --> 02:56.506
Hello?

02:56.508 --> 02:58.392
Hello, Leonard.

02:58.394 --> 03:01.345
Hey, buddy.
Good to hear your voice.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.846
Uh, I'm in Kingman, Arizona,

03:02.848 --> 03:06.350
and, uh, I need you
to come pick me up.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.218
I'd love to.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.887
I'm just about
to do yoga with Penny.

03:12.657 --> 03:14.608
Leonard, I'm at
the police station.

03:14.610 --> 03:15.610
I was robbed.

03:15.611 --> 03:17.194
Th-They took my phone,

03:17.196 --> 03:19.363
my wallet, my iPad, everything.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.564
Oh, my God, are you okay?

03:20.566 --> 03:21.566
No,

03:21.567 --> 03:22.649
I'm not okay.

03:22.651 --> 03:24.534
I-I'm wearing borrowed pants,

03:24.536 --> 03:26.620
I-I don't have I.D.,

03:26.622 --> 03:28.038
and one of the officers here

03:28.040 --> 03:30.540
won't stop calling me
Chicken Legs.

03:30.542 --> 03:31.875
Okay.

03:31.877 --> 03:33.126
Uh, I'll-I'll
come get you.

03:33.128 --> 03:34.077
What's the address?

03:34.079 --> 03:35.128
Hey, what's going on?
Oh.

03:35.130 --> 03:36.713
He got all of
his stuff stolen.

03:36.715 --> 03:37.998
Oh...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.083
Okay...

03:40.085 --> 03:41.251
Sheldon, hang tight.

03:41.253 --> 03:42.919
Hey, do you want me
to bring anything?

03:42.921 --> 03:44.254
Oh, yes, please.

03:44.256 --> 03:45.422
A pair of pants.

03:45.424 --> 03:46.673
And my toothbrush.

03:46.675 --> 03:48.342
Yeah, and my mail.

03:48.344 --> 03:50.260
And a really good comeback
for Chicken Legs,

03:50.262 --> 03:52.346
because “I know you are,
but what am I?”

03:52.348 --> 03:55.015
was met with stony silence.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.900
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

03:56.902 --> 03:58.101
Is he okay?

03:58.103 --> 03:59.820
Yeah, he's fine, he's
just a little rattled.

03:59.822 --> 04:00.679
Oh...

04:00.703 --> 04:01.906
Feel like driving
to Arizona with me?

04:01.907 --> 04:03.240
I can't, I have
that job interview.

04:03.242 --> 04:04.608
Oh, right.
Besides,

04:04.610 --> 04:06.159
I don't need six hours of
“Your hair is different.

04:06.161 --> 04:07.444
“Why did you change your hair?

04:07.446 --> 04:09.946
I'm holding my breath
until your hair grows back.”

04:10.782 --> 04:12.499
All right, fine.

04:13.468 --> 04:14.868
Hey, can you
think of a reason

04:14.870 --> 04:16.249
I shouldn't invite
Amy to come with me?

04:16.274 --> 04:17.005
Nope.

04:17.005 --> 04:19.706
Come on, you didn't even try.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.959
Thanks for the lift.

04:22.961 --> 04:24.294
What's wrong
with your car?

04:24.296 --> 04:27.514
I'm having my windows untinted.

04:27.516 --> 04:29.349
Why?

04:29.351 --> 04:30.717
Got a hot girlfriend now.

04:30.719 --> 04:32.602
I want the haters to know.

04:32.604 --> 04:34.021
What are you talking about?

04:34.023 --> 04:35.639
No one's paying
attention to you.

04:35.641 --> 04:36.973
Wow.

04:36.975 --> 04:39.559
How's that Hater-Ade
taste, bro?

04:40.812 --> 04:42.479
Hey, this isn't
the way to work.

04:42.481 --> 04:45.565
I just want to pop in
and make sure Ma's okay.

04:45.567 --> 04:47.150
I thought Stuart
was looking after her.

04:47.152 --> 04:50.704
He was, but now that her cast
is off, he moved out.

04:50.706 --> 04:52.205
And honestly, I'm kind of glad.

04:52.207 --> 04:53.657
It was getting a little weird.

04:53.659 --> 04:54.875
How so?

04:54.877 --> 04:56.076
I don't know,
they're...

04:56.078 --> 04:58.745
chummy.

04:58.747 --> 05:00.330
Like us?

05:00.332 --> 05:01.832
No, not like us.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.166
Creepy chummy,

05:03.168 --> 05:05.469
like you and your dog.

05:05.471 --> 05:09.056
She feeds him out
of her own mouth?

05:10.091 --> 05:12.259
I mean, he calls
her Debbie,

05:12.261 --> 05:14.428
she calls
him Stewie

05:14.430 --> 05:16.146
and they're all giggly
around each other.

05:16.148 --> 05:18.231
And believe me,
when food goes in that mouth,

05:18.233 --> 05:19.933
it does not come out.

05:19.935 --> 05:21.852
So are you worried

05:21.854 --> 05:24.604
because he's replacing you
as a son

05:24.606 --> 05:27.407
or are you worried because
he's becoming her lover?

05:27.409 --> 05:30.110
First of all, no one can
replace me as a son.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.661
I'm her little matzo ball.

05:31.663 --> 05:33.580
And secondly,

05:33.582 --> 05:35.198
my mother is well past

05:35.200 --> 05:37.784
having any kind of sex life.

05:37.786 --> 05:39.586
Okay, okay.

05:40.621 --> 05:43.206
Although many older women
lead vibrant, active...

05:43.208 --> 05:45.125
I said well past it!

05:47.712 --> 05:50.297
Excuse me,
Officer Hernandez?

05:50.299 --> 05:53.350
Any leads on the person
who stole my belongings?

05:53.352 --> 05:54.384
Not yet.

05:54.386 --> 05:55.552
Well, perhaps I can help.

05:55.554 --> 05:57.437
Sherlock Holmes
always says

05:57.439 --> 06:00.557
when you eliminate
the impossible,

06:00.559 --> 06:02.859
whatever remains,
however improbable,

06:02.861 --> 06:04.194
must be the truth.

06:04.196 --> 06:07.447
Now, have-have you
tried doing that?

06:07.449 --> 06:09.316
Nope.

06:09.318 --> 06:12.903
Well, maybe you should.

06:12.905 --> 06:15.739
Th-Th-There's lots of books
called “Sherlock Holmes”

06:15.741 --> 06:18.408
and there's no books
called “Officer Hernandez.”

06:24.699 --> 06:26.833
Thanks again
for coming.

06:26.835 --> 06:29.219
Six hours was gonna be
a long drive by myself.

06:29.221 --> 06:30.504
My pleasure.

06:30.506 --> 06:33.173
And I'm not angry at all
that my boyfriend

06:33.175 --> 06:35.342
was in trouble
and called you instead of me.

06:35.344 --> 06:36.560
I love that!

06:38.312 --> 06:42.732
Yeah, time's gonna fly by.

06:43.901 --> 06:46.903
I haven't been on a job
interview in years.

06:46.905 --> 06:47.988
I'm really nervous.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.072
Don't be.

06:49.074 --> 06:50.991
You are built for
pharmaceutical sales.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.777
You're cute,
you're flirty and...

06:53.779 --> 06:56.580
Started that like there
were gonna be three things.

06:57.698 --> 07:00.033
I don't have
any experience in sales.

07:00.035 --> 07:02.953
Unless you count the bikini
car wash I did in high school.

07:02.955 --> 07:05.705
But you already made me
take that off my résumé.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.376
This job is a lot
like being a waitress,

07:09.378 --> 07:10.877
except instead of
pushing the fish tacos

07:10.879 --> 07:12.128
'cause they're
about to go bad,

07:12.130 --> 07:14.214
you're just pushing
our antidepressants

07:14.216 --> 07:16.933
before the FDA finds out they
may cause rectal bleeding.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.203
They do?

07:20.205 --> 07:22.639
Maybe.

07:23.808 --> 07:26.142
But like our lawyers say,
the world is full of things

07:26.144 --> 07:28.645
that can cause a
rectum to bleed.

07:30.147 --> 07:31.364
Anyway, I talked
you up to Dan.

07:31.366 --> 07:32.949
He's the guy who'll
be interviewing you.

07:32.951 --> 07:34.317
Oh, I really appreciate this.

07:34.319 --> 07:35.986
I just hope I'm not
in over my head.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.904
You'll be fine.
Just be yourself.

07:37.906 --> 07:39.539
I wish I felt more confident.
Penny,

07:39.541 --> 07:41.157
I wouldn't have put
you up for this job

07:41.159 --> 07:42.325
if I didn't think
you could handle it.

07:42.327 --> 07:44.694
Oh, thank you,
but maybe I should cancel.

07:44.696 --> 07:46.546
It's too late to cancel.
You're going.

07:46.548 --> 07:48.448
But I don't know anything
about pharmaceuticals.

07:48.450 --> 07:49.833
Oh, I understand.

07:49.835 --> 07:51.801
You want to do something
you're already good at.

07:51.803 --> 07:53.053
I know.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.721
Why don't I get
you a job at

07:54.723 --> 07:57.641
the Sitting Around All Day
Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?

08:01.596 --> 08:03.813
They're comfortable.

08:05.933 --> 08:09.352
Ma, I hope you're decent.
Raj is here!

08:09.354 --> 08:10.737
You just started seeing
naked women again,

08:10.739 --> 08:12.405
and I don't want you
to be confused

08:12.407 --> 08:13.857
about where the boobs should be.

08:15.026 --> 08:16.576
Oh, hey, guys.

08:16.578 --> 08:18.028
What are you
doing here?

08:18.030 --> 08:20.780
Uh... w-what are you doing here?

08:20.782 --> 08:21.948
I thought you moved out.

08:21.950 --> 08:23.867
Oh, yeah, I was going to,

08:23.869 --> 08:25.869
and then Debbie
and I got to talking

08:25.871 --> 08:27.454
over dinner
the other night.

08:27.456 --> 08:28.705
I didn't have anyplace to go,

08:28.707 --> 08:30.006
she likes having me around,

08:30.008 --> 08:32.759
so we both said, “Why leave?”
at the same time.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.960
(laughs)

08:33.962 --> 08:36.179
It was precious.

08:37.265 --> 08:39.633
It's not that precious.

08:39.635 --> 08:41.051
I'd like to
back you up,

08:41.053 --> 08:43.102
but it sounds like it
was pretty precious.

08:47.391 --> 08:50.560
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Stewie, I can't find my glasses!

08:50.562 --> 08:52.312
Be right there, Deb Deb!

08:54.031 --> 08:55.565
They're probably on her head.

08:56.901 --> 08:58.735
Or in her neck.
Listen.

08:59.987 --> 09:02.789
You staying here
seems like something

09:02.791 --> 09:04.908
she would've talked
to me about.

09:04.910 --> 09:07.577
Well, maybe if you called your
mother more often, you'd know.

09:11.132 --> 09:13.717
It wouldn't kill you
to pick up the phone.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:29.166 --> 09:31.034
Any word on my
stolen items?

09:31.036 --> 09:33.169
We're doing everything we can.

09:34.005 --> 09:35.672
You know, Sherlock Holmes

09:35.674 --> 09:37.907
liked to use cocaine
to sharpen his focus.

09:40.878 --> 09:44.381
But I'm sure those Cool Ranch
Doritos are doing the trick.

09:45.816 --> 09:47.017
Sheldon.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.618
(gasps)
Leonard!

09:48.620 --> 09:50.971
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

09:50.973 --> 09:53.089
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine.

09:53.091 --> 09:54.958
Why did you come?

09:56.427 --> 09:58.094
What do you mean,
why did I come?

09:58.096 --> 09:59.179
You're my boyfriend.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.880
I haven't seen you
in over a month.

10:00.882 --> 10:02.882
I just drove six hours
to help you out.

10:02.884 --> 10:04.467
Don't you have
anything to say besides,

10:04.469 --> 10:05.685
“Why did you come?”

10:06.687 --> 10:08.438
I do, but...

10:08.440 --> 10:10.140
I feel uncomfortable
saying it out loud

10:10.142 --> 10:11.891
in front of these
police officers.

10:13.394 --> 10:14.394
Fine.

10:14.396 --> 10:15.612
Whisper it.

10:20.317 --> 10:21.534
Shotgun.

10:34.262 --> 10:36.597
So, Sheldon, tell
us about your trip.

10:36.599 --> 10:38.015
Where'd you go?

10:38.017 --> 10:39.516
Where didn't I go?

10:39.518 --> 10:40.601
I went to New York,

10:40.603 --> 10:43.854
Chicago, Atlanta, Denver,

10:43.856 --> 10:45.322
Seattle.

10:45.324 --> 10:46.824
How were they?

10:46.826 --> 10:48.242
Oh, I have no idea.

10:48.244 --> 10:49.910
I never left
the train station.

10:51.413 --> 10:53.781
Hang on. You traveled
across the entire country

10:53.783 --> 10:55.666
and never left a train station?

10:55.668 --> 10:56.917
Why would I?

10:56.919 --> 10:58.869
That's where
all the cool trains are.

11:00.338 --> 11:02.706
I'm sorry, so you
never went outside?

11:02.708 --> 11:05.426
Or had a single
piece of fruit.

11:08.847 --> 11:09.880
So...

11:09.882 --> 11:11.015
why do you think
you'd make

11:11.017 --> 11:14.268
a good pharmaceutical sales rep?

11:14.270 --> 11:16.303
Well, I'm a people person.
Mm-hmm.

11:16.305 --> 11:17.471
People like me.

11:17.473 --> 11:19.690
Some of my favorite people
are people.

11:20.692 --> 11:22.610
I feel like I'm saying
“people” a lot.

11:22.612 --> 11:25.279
People, people, people, PE...
Okay, I'm done.

11:25.281 --> 11:26.730
You sure?

11:26.732 --> 11:27.898
People.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.867
Yes.

11:29.869 --> 11:31.735
Good!

11:31.737 --> 11:32.870
So, how do you feel

11:32.872 --> 11:34.905
your previous job experience
has prepared you

11:34.907 --> 11:36.824
for a career like this?

11:36.826 --> 11:39.960
Uh, well, as a waitress,
sales was a big part of my job.

11:39.962 --> 11:42.496
I mean, believe me, I convinced
a lot of very large customers,

11:42.498 --> 11:44.048
who should not be
eating cheesecake,

11:44.050 --> 11:45.966
to have more cheesecake.

11:45.968 --> 11:47.251
I mean,

11:47.253 --> 11:49.386
one of those chubsters
even had an insulin pump!

11:49.388 --> 11:52.089
Uh-huh!

11:53.174 --> 11:56.210
I have an insulin pump.

11:58.396 --> 12:00.597
People.
(quiet laugh)

12:03.184 --> 12:04.652
It's weird, right?

12:04.654 --> 12:08.105
A grown man in his 30s
living with my mother.

12:08.107 --> 12:09.440
That is weird.

12:09.442 --> 12:12.576
I thought he was, like, 45.

12:12.578 --> 12:14.611
Come on, you don't think
it's a little odd?

12:14.613 --> 12:16.747
I don't know!
I mean, she's lonely.

12:16.749 --> 12:18.115
He needs a place to stay.

12:18.117 --> 12:20.084
I doubt there's
any funny business going on.

12:20.086 --> 12:21.335
And even if there was,

12:21.337 --> 12:22.703
who cares?
They're both adults.

12:22.705 --> 12:24.288
“Who cares”?!
You wouldn't care

12:24.290 --> 12:26.256
if I slept with your mom?

12:26.258 --> 12:27.958
You know what?
You're my best friend,

12:27.960 --> 12:29.293
and she's in a bad marriage.

12:29.295 --> 12:31.378
I give you my blessing.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.630
This is stupid.

12:33.632 --> 12:36.967
I'm just gonna call my mother
and be honest with her.

12:36.969 --> 12:39.770
'Cause that's
what little matzo balls do.

12:41.890 --> 12:43.857
(line ringing)

12:43.859 --> 12:44.975
STUART:
This is Debbie!

12:44.977 --> 12:46.310
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
And this is Stuart!

12:46.312 --> 12:49.980
BOTH:
Just kidding!

12:49.982 --> 12:52.950
STUART:
Leave a message!

12:52.952 --> 12:55.119
(beeps)

12:56.287 --> 12:59.373
(whispers):
This is the part where you talk.

13:01.743 --> 13:03.827
All right, let's say
a physician was prescribing

13:03.829 --> 13:06.246
one of our competitor's drugs.

13:06.248 --> 13:08.298
How would you convince them
to switch to ours?

13:12.921 --> 13:15.155
Um...

13:15.157 --> 13:16.890
any chance his car needs

13:16.892 --> 13:20.227
to be washed by a girl
in a bikini?

13:20.879 --> 13:23.230
(quietly):
No...

13:23.232 --> 13:25.566
Okay, I'm really sorry
for wasting your time.

13:25.568 --> 13:28.152
Don't worry about it.
Thanks for stopping by.

13:28.154 --> 13:30.354
Okay, thanks.

13:31.740 --> 13:34.658
Um, I'm sor...
Listen, could you do me a favor

13:34.660 --> 13:37.528
and not tell Bernadette
how badly I blew this interview?

13:37.530 --> 13:38.846
She'll get upset.

13:38.848 --> 13:42.616
And honestly I'm a...
a little terrified of her.

13:42.618 --> 13:46.086
Wait, wait.
You're scared of Bernadette?

13:46.088 --> 13:47.704
Yeah, kind of.

13:47.706 --> 13:51.208
I thought it was just me!

13:53.128 --> 13:54.678
E-Everyone thinks she's so nice

13:54.680 --> 13:58.015
with that squeaky little voice.

13:58.017 --> 13:59.900
I know, but she's
kind of a bully!

13:59.902 --> 14:01.969
(stammers)
She is!

14:01.971 --> 14:03.470
I-I didn't even want
to meet you,

14:03.472 --> 14:07.057
but, uh, I was too scared
to say no to her.

14:07.059 --> 14:08.692
Me, too!

14:08.694 --> 14:10.394
Yeah, yeah!
One-one time, I had...

14:10.396 --> 14:12.062
Oh! (laughs)
I had to tell her

14:12.064 --> 14:13.564
we were cutting
the-the research funding

14:13.566 --> 14:15.315
for one of the drugs
she was developing.

14:15.317 --> 14:16.567
What happened?

14:16.569 --> 14:18.152
I couldn't do it!

14:18.154 --> 14:20.237
She's still working on it!
(laughs)

14:20.239 --> 14:22.573
(laughing)

14:23.541 --> 14:24.708
Oh!

14:24.710 --> 14:26.577
We're not gonna tell her
about this, right?

14:26.579 --> 14:28.912
Oh, my God, no!
No, no...

14:30.081 --> 14:32.382
At the hot dog stand
in the Denver train station--

14:32.384 --> 14:34.051
Heinz ketchup.

14:34.053 --> 14:35.219
At the hot dog stand

14:35.221 --> 14:36.753
in the Salt Lake City
train station--

14:36.755 --> 14:38.172
Heinz ketchup.

14:38.174 --> 14:41.809
At the hot dog stand in the
Indianapolis train station...

14:43.144 --> 14:45.729
I don't care.

14:47.599 --> 14:49.266
Wrong! Hunt's!

14:50.685 --> 14:52.102
Hey, Amy!
What do you say?

14:52.104 --> 14:54.321
You ready to move on
to the mustard round?

14:54.323 --> 14:57.191
Have you not noticed that
I've been sitting back here

14:57.193 --> 14:59.693
quietly stewing for
the past two hours?

15:00.528 --> 15:02.996
I just thought
you were bad at the game.

15:04.249 --> 15:05.999
I'm mad at you!

15:06.868 --> 15:08.502
How could you just
go away like that

15:08.504 --> 15:09.703
without even
saying good-bye,

15:09.705 --> 15:12.122
and then call Leonard
for help instead of me?

15:14.843 --> 15:15.959
Amy?

15:15.961 --> 15:18.128
May I please have
a moment of privacy

15:18.130 --> 15:20.264
to speak with my roommate?

15:20.266 --> 15:23.517
We're in a moving car!

15:25.553 --> 15:26.970
What do you expect me to do?

15:26.972 --> 15:29.022
Stick my fingers in my ears?

15:29.024 --> 15:30.691
Well, I was thinking
put your head out the window

15:30.693 --> 15:32.192
like a dog, but that'll work.

15:33.311 --> 15:35.112
Please? This'll be quick.

15:39.951 --> 15:41.568
Leonard?

15:41.570 --> 15:43.036
As soon as we get home,

15:43.038 --> 15:45.405
I want to have coitus with Amy.

15:52.664 --> 15:54.381
Okay, she can't hear.

15:57.335 --> 15:59.336
The reason I called you

15:59.338 --> 16:01.755
is because I didn't want Amy

16:01.757 --> 16:04.391
to know I couldn't make it
on my own.

16:04.393 --> 16:06.426
What's the big deal?

16:06.428 --> 16:08.896
Oh, of course it's
no big deal to you.

16:08.898 --> 16:11.398
You idolize me,
and nothing could ever knock me

16:11.400 --> 16:13.600
off that pedestal you put me on.

16:13.602 --> 16:15.686
Well, yeah, it's true.

16:15.688 --> 16:17.571
You-you are a god to me.

16:18.773 --> 16:20.357
Can I stop now?

16:20.359 --> 16:23.193
Just tell her.

16:24.245 --> 16:26.580
I called Leonard because...

16:26.582 --> 16:28.582
I failed.

16:28.584 --> 16:31.919
And I didn't want you
to think less of me.

16:32.754 --> 16:34.922
You were worried about that?

16:36.257 --> 16:38.458
Yes.

16:40.511 --> 16:42.879
Sheldon...

16:42.881 --> 16:46.383
it's okay with me that
you're not perfect.

16:50.305 --> 16:53.807
Can I have one more moment
with Leonard?

16:53.809 --> 16:56.026
Sure.

17:03.067 --> 17:06.536
Amy just hurt my feelings.
I want to break up with her.

17:09.290 --> 17:12.041
Now, I never thought
I'd say this, but I'm

17:12.044 --> 17:15.244
kind of excited to see Sheldon.

17:15.247 --> 17:18.498
I never thought I'd say this,
but Penny got a job today.

17:19.384 --> 17:20.784
She did?

17:20.786 --> 17:22.252
Well, the only reason she got it

17:22.253 --> 17:25.222
is 'cause the guy
who interviewed her loves me.

17:25.223 --> 17:26.973
(knocking)

17:27.925 --> 17:30.093
(clears throat)

17:31.095 --> 17:33.263
What do you want?

17:33.265 --> 17:36.149
I, uh, kind of got the feeling

17:36.151 --> 17:39.102
you might not be okay with me
staying at your mom's.

17:39.104 --> 17:40.354
You're right, I'm not.

17:40.356 --> 17:41.738
I think it's weird.

17:41.740 --> 17:42.773
Howie?

17:42.775 --> 17:44.074
It is. He's a grown man.

17:44.076 --> 17:45.659
He's just gonna
live there rent-free?

17:45.661 --> 17:46.943
How is that gonna motivate him

17:46.945 --> 17:49.079
to get off his butt
and get a job?

17:49.081 --> 17:52.032
I mean, do you even have a plan?

17:52.034 --> 17:54.501
Hey, you're not my father, okay?

17:54.503 --> 17:56.620
And besides, your mother
and I were talking...

17:56.622 --> 17:58.789
“Your mother and I”?
You're not my father!

17:58.791 --> 17:59.956
I didn't say I was your father!

17:59.958 --> 18:01.008
Well, I didn't say

18:01.010 --> 18:02.709
I was your father!
Okay, calm down.

18:02.711 --> 18:04.678
You're not his father,
he's not your father!

18:04.680 --> 18:07.547
Nobody's anybody's father.

18:07.549 --> 18:09.266
I-I'm sorry
you don't like my life choices,

18:09.268 --> 18:10.634
but it's my life!

18:10.636 --> 18:12.936
Well, it's my house,
it's my rules!

18:12.938 --> 18:14.971
Oh-oh! Okay, Dad!

18:14.973 --> 18:17.607
If I mow the lawn,
can I have my allowance?

18:17.609 --> 18:19.693
Hey, don't you take that
sarcastic tone with him!

18:19.695 --> 18:21.061
I don't have
to listen to you!

18:21.063 --> 18:22.312
Don't talk to her like that!

18:22.314 --> 18:23.897
That is my mother... Wife!

18:23.899 --> 18:25.816
My wife! I said my wife!

18:25.818 --> 18:27.484
You know what?

18:27.486 --> 18:28.869
This isn't getting us anywhere.

18:28.871 --> 18:31.571
When you're ready to apologize,
you know where to find me.

18:31.573 --> 18:33.824
Well, yeah, in my house!

18:33.826 --> 18:35.992
That's right, sucka!

18:38.996 --> 18:41.548
I wish I'd never
gone on that trip.

18:41.550 --> 18:44.167
I feel no better now
than when I left.

18:44.169 --> 18:45.669
But you still
accomplished something.

18:45.671 --> 18:47.387
Yeah. If you had
told anyone

18:47.389 --> 18:49.556
that you were going away
on a train by yourself

18:49.558 --> 18:52.175
across the country, do you
know what they would have said?

18:52.177 --> 18:54.177
That I couldn't do it?
Exactly.

18:54.179 --> 18:56.897
Right after they said, “Yay!”

18:58.182 --> 18:59.766
But you did do it.

18:59.768 --> 19:01.852
So what if it didn't
all go your way?

19:01.854 --> 19:04.154
That's what makes it
an adventure.

19:04.156 --> 19:06.156
That's a good point.

19:06.158 --> 19:09.776
Yeah, I'm a lot like
Gandalf the Grey.

19:09.778 --> 19:11.995
He fought the Balrog and emerged

19:11.997 --> 19:14.614
stronger than ever
as Gandalf the White.

19:14.616 --> 19:17.200
I was robbed
of my phone and pants,

19:17.202 --> 19:19.536
and I, too,
came back stronger.

19:19.538 --> 19:21.421
And whiter, too,
'cause I wasn't

19:21.423 --> 19:24.291
in direct sunlight
for six weeks.

19:24.293 --> 19:27.544
See? This trip
was good for you.

19:27.546 --> 19:29.096
Indeed.

19:29.098 --> 19:32.382
I was the world's
smartest caterpillar.

19:32.384 --> 19:36.219
And then after pupating
in our nation's railway system,

19:36.221 --> 19:37.721
I've burst forth

19:37.723 --> 19:40.941
as the world's
smartest butterfly.

19:41.893 --> 19:43.059
Butterfly could've
gotten himself

19:43.061 --> 19:45.612
home from Arizona.

19:47.031 --> 19:48.565
Yeah, I feel renewed.

19:48.567 --> 19:49.567
I'm ready

19:49.568 --> 19:50.700
to deal with any changes

19:50.702 --> 19:52.068
that come my way.

19:52.553 --> 19:54.404
Hey!
Hey!

19:54.406 --> 19:55.906
Look who's back!

19:55.908 --> 19:57.491
Your hair is different.
You changed your hair.

19:57.493 --> 19:59.976
I can't take this.
I'm out.

20:07.850 --> 20:09.901
Would you like to see pictures
from my trip?

20:09.903 --> 20:11.435
I thought your
phone got stolen.

20:11.437 --> 20:13.321
Yeah, it did,
but luckily all my photos

20:13.323 --> 20:15.423
got backed up to the Cloud.

20:15.425 --> 20:18.693
And you thought they
all had a silver lining.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.111
Here-- day one.

20:20.113 --> 20:21.462
Uh, this was the seat

20:21.464 --> 20:23.281
I was going to sit in but didn't

20:23.283 --> 20:26.033
because there were
cracker crumbs on it.

20:26.035 --> 20:29.387
As it was first class,
I suspect Ritz.

20:30.722 --> 20:33.908
This is the train bathroom.

20:33.910 --> 20:35.576
This is the Imodium I took

20:35.578 --> 20:38.312
so I would never have
to use the train bathroom.

20:38.314 --> 20:40.031
I cannot believe

20:40.033 --> 20:41.465
you traveled the
entire country

20:41.467 --> 20:42.934
and never left
the train station.

20:42.936 --> 20:44.886
I know.
You know, I almost died

20:44.888 --> 20:47.972
in a fire in Des Moines,
but I stayed put.

20:47.974 --> 20:49.640
FYI--

20:49.642 --> 20:51.409
that's when
the Imodium gave out.
