You're okay. You're okay.

[Betty on radio]
Loud and clear, Base station.

01:17.381 --> 01:20.123
I'm still a bumper sticker
on this shady-ass truck,

01:20.167 --> 01:21.646

01:21.690 --> 01:24.649
He's approaching the westbound
turn off at Exit 49.

01:27.783 --> 01:30.090
That's too far. Two more miles
and you'll be out of range.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.526
Hold on. He's pulling over.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.399
I'm going to park
and approach him on foot.

01:35.443 --> 01:40.622
Betty, just please,
please be careful.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.150
[Betty] Hey.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.633
[trucker] Didn't think
I'd come across anyone.

01:51.676 --> 01:54.853
Yeah, I'm just taking a break,
stretching my legs.

01:54.897 --> 01:58.683
It gets lonely out here
on the long, dark road.

01:58.727 --> 02:02.034
You want some company,
even for a little bit?

02:02.078 --> 02:03.384
What, in the woods?

02:04.211 --> 02:05.864
Or maybe back in my truck?

02:05.908 --> 02:07.214
That sounds good.

[suspenseful music plays]

Do you do this a lot?

02:14.743 --> 02:16.919
Pick up pretty girls
on the side of the road?

02:16.962 --> 02:18.355
[Betty chuckles]

02:18.399 --> 02:21.793
I guess I've had my fair
share of encounters, yeah.

02:23.143 --> 02:27.277
Uh, before we do this, uh...

02:27.321 --> 02:29.105
I just wanna make sure
that you've got cash.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.194
That's all I needed to hear.

-FBI, freeze!
-Don't move.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.633
What is this?

02:35.677 --> 02:38.027
FBI. We're taking you in
for solicitation.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.289
Okay, This is a mistake.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.465
I am also with the FBI.

02:41.509 --> 02:45.600
No, you're not, Betty.
You quit, remember?

02:48.385 --> 02:49.995
What the hell are you
doing out here?

02:50.039 --> 02:52.215
I'm trying to catch our killer.
What are you doing, Glen?

02:52.259 --> 02:54.174
I'm trying to clean up
the Lonely Highway.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.958
By entrapping young women?

02:56.001 --> 02:58.656
We should be helping them,
not arresting them.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.268
God, I should have stabbed you
harder when I had the chance.

03:01.311 --> 03:05.663
You do realize
it's illegal to impersonate
an FBI agent, right?

03:05.707 --> 03:07.752
You shouldn't have
that badge or a gun.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.233
Hand them over.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.365
Or should I arrest you?

03:41.830 --> 03:44.615
Compulsion, thy name is
Kevin of Finland.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.751
Does Eric have
chronic nightmares
that you know of?

03:49.794 --> 03:54.408
Yeah, but I mean
nothing like last night.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.757
Looks like he was living it.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.414
What about you?
Any nightmares since the war?

04:02.111 --> 04:04.896
Um, yeah, at first...

04:04.940 --> 04:06.550
but I haven't had one
in months.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.251
I've known
soldiers like Eric.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.600
They've crossed a Rubicon,

04:12.643 --> 04:14.515
the only way back is with
professional help.

04:14.558 --> 04:17.387
Well, wasn't there a recovery
place that Eric was supposed
to go to?

04:17.431 --> 04:19.781
Yeah, he tried calling a
bunch of times

04:19.824 --> 04:23.654
and they kept promising
him a spot, but still nothing.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.266
Well, don't give up.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.485
In the meantime, I'm going
to look into something else.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.492
What are those?

04:35.536 --> 04:38.365
Leads I got on the DL from
from one of my former
colleagues in New York.

04:38.408 --> 04:42.282
Names of fat cats with money
burning holes in their pockets.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.457
Potential investors.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.936
Branching out from jewelry?

04:44.980 --> 04:47.287
I need to start
making money, Reggie.

04:47.330 --> 04:51.769
Real money to replace
all the funds that Chad lost
in his pathetic Ponzi scheme.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.119
Funds, I'm responsible
for, the snake.

04:54.163 --> 04:57.732
So I'm getting back into
aggressive investment banking.

04:57.775 --> 05:00.256
Don't you have to be
on Wall Street to do that?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.649
A common misconception.

05:01.692 --> 05:06.131
All you need is two things.
This and names.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.699
Which means time
to make it rain.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.224
Good morning, Cheryl.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.487
Can I help you?

05:14.575 --> 05:16.403
No, no, no. Sweet Kevin.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.449
The question is,
can I help you?

05:19.493 --> 05:20.972
We saw each other in the woods.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.279
I was seeking inspiration
for my next sermon.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.412
But what about you?

05:25.455 --> 05:29.503
I thought you gave up cruising
after your latest violent
encounter in the steam room.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.548
I did, for a while.

05:31.592 --> 05:34.899
I see. Do you know
what I believe, Kevin?

05:34.943 --> 05:36.988
I don't think you were
just looking for a hook-up.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.774
I also think you were
looking for meaning.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.950
Peace.

05:41.993 --> 05:45.432
No, I'm pretty sure I was just
looking for a hook-up.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.261
Kev-Kev...

05:49.305 --> 05:53.614
I don't know if you've heard,
but my mother and I recently
started a ministry.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.659
Why don't you
come to a service?

05:55.703 --> 05:57.574
You might find the answers
you're looking for.

05:57.618 --> 06:01.622
No offense, Cheryl,
but that sounds like a
classic Blossom scam.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.451
Well, I can't speak
for Mumsy, but...

06:05.234 --> 06:06.757
for me, it's no scam.

06:06.801 --> 06:10.935
Understand my calling is
for a higher purpose.

06:10.979 --> 06:16.201
Since I began ministering,
I felt the best I have since...

06:16.245 --> 06:18.900
well, since the night
of that misbegotten key party.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.687
What's the harm in trying
one service?

06:23.731 --> 06:26.560
Okay, yeah. I'll come
just to check it out.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.740
You're lucky it was Glen
and not the Highway Killer.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.219
You would have been
on your own.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.526
Well, I didn't want to
lose him.

06:36.570 --> 06:39.399
Anyways. I doubt I'll be
spending much more time
on the lonely highway

06:39.442 --> 06:41.575
now that Glen's gunning for me.

06:42.750 --> 06:47.363
So maybe we bring the
Lonely Highway here...

06:47.407 --> 06:49.539
to Pop's, and the Whyte Wyrm.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.585
Go on.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.501
The Highway Killer is most
likely a trucker, right?

06:54.544 --> 06:58.983
-Mm.
-Well, what if we offer
something to lure truckers in?

06:59.027 --> 07:00.071
Entertainment?

07:00.898 --> 07:02.073
Smart.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.988
We're not going after
"truckers" plural,

07:04.032 --> 07:06.034
we're going after
one trucker in particular,

07:06.077 --> 07:09.559
or killer, who is targeting...
young women.

07:11.039 --> 07:14.259
Okay, crazy idea.
Have you ever seen Coyote Ugly?

07:14.303 --> 07:17.611
Um, please.
Can't Fight The Moonlight
is one of my karaoke go-to's.

07:17.654 --> 07:21.528
Okay, so maybe that's what
we need to tempt
our little friend.

07:21.571 --> 07:24.095
Riverdale's very own
Coyote Ugly.

07:24.139 --> 07:28.099
And we can wire Pop's
and the Wyrm
with close circuit cameras,

07:28.143 --> 07:31.842
and we could start compiling
a database that not even
the FBI has.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.105
Tracking regulars,
running license plates.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.630
Let's do it. Together.

07:37.674 --> 07:38.806
We'll talk to Fangs.

07:41.635 --> 07:42.984
Six hours.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.725
We wait six hours to see
someone and they tell us

07:44.768 --> 07:47.292
we haven't filled out
the right forms.

07:47.336 --> 07:51.035

happens every time I go
down to the VA.

Where did you get this idea
from, Uncle Frank?

08:14.363 --> 08:15.930
I've known a lot of veterans
who adopted pets.

back to civilian life.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.503
Where'd you get him?

08:23.546 --> 08:25.330
Got him out of
the shelter downtown.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.507
According to the vet,
they found him near a dumpster.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.683
[Eric] They tell you
what happened to his ears?

08:29.726 --> 08:31.728
No, they weren't sure.

08:31.772 --> 08:34.731
Hey, Arch, didn't you have
a dog last time I was here?
what was his name?

What happened to him?

08:37.255 --> 08:39.388
When I enlisted, Mom took him
to Chicago with her.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.695
He died while I was overseas.

Aah, damn.

in an IPO before?

you just need to know
how to close a sale,

10:02.123 --> 10:04.125

that we would love for you
to run by Toni.

Okay.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.985
If we want to attract
the Highway Killer,

10:38.028 --> 10:40.727
we have to give him
something enticing to look at.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.325
Again, my name is

11:14.369 --> 11:15.413
Sergeant Archie Andrews,

11:15.457 --> 11:16.327
I'm calling on behalf of

11:16.371 --> 11:17.546
Corporal Eric Jackson

11:17.589 --> 11:18.678
about getting him
some treatment.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.724
I've left my number
with you before,

11:21.768 --> 11:22.899
If you could give me
a call back,

11:22.943 --> 11:23.857
that would be great.

11:25.075 --> 11:25.946
Thank you.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.212
[sighs in exasperation]

11:32.082 --> 11:33.431
[Frank] How are you doing?

11:35.825 --> 11:36.957
Thinking about Vegas?

11:38.045 --> 11:39.220
No.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.004
I'm thinking about Bingo.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.266
Who's Bingo?

11:44.704 --> 11:45.617
Uh...

11:46.488 --> 11:48.795
He was this stray dog...

11:48.838 --> 11:50.405
that our platoon adopted.

11:52.015 --> 11:52.973
What happened to him?

11:53.843 --> 11:54.714
He didn't make it..

11:55.627 --> 11:56.759
Yeah.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.152
We don't like
talking about him much.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.544
It's probably why
Eric gets so happy

11:59.588 --> 12:00.937
about getting this new dog...

12:02.417 --> 12:03.897
to make up for Bingo.

12:04.898 --> 12:05.986
Yeah,

12:06.029 --> 12:07.248
that makes sense.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.296
[clock ticking]

12:12.340 --> 12:14.037
[Reggie] I want this for you,

12:14.081 --> 12:16.953
and more importantly,
you should want this
for yourself.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.042
You're a smart guy, Bobby,

12:19.086 --> 12:22.698
I mean, just think about
what this type of investment
could mean for your family.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.222
I'm talking
a down payment
on the house,

12:25.266 --> 12:28.356
college tuition
for your son or daughter,

12:28.399 --> 12:30.097
vacations you deserve

12:30.140 --> 12:32.273
but haven't been
able to afford.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.057
[inhales] You're in
at a hundred?

12:34.101 --> 12:36.320
[upbeat music plays]

12:37.278 --> 12:38.932
[breathes] Mr. Stone,

12:38.975 --> 12:41.891
I'm telling you,
you won't regret this.

12:41.935 --> 12:42.979
Hmm-mm.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.589
I'll email you the paperwork.

12:45.112 --> 12:45.939
Hm-mm.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.204
Very good, Reginald,

12:50.247 --> 12:51.988
you're a natural salesman.

12:52.032 --> 12:55.818
Welcome, officially,
to Pearls and Posh.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.255
Look, Cheryl, I don't mean
to offend you or anything,

12:58.299 --> 13:01.302
but your service
wasn't exactly my speed.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.434
To each his own.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.436
But there is a hole inside you

13:05.480 --> 13:07.134
that you're trying
to fill, Kevin,

13:07.177 --> 13:09.005
and I think I know
what it's about.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.138
Fangs...

13:11.181 --> 13:12.443
how you left things with him.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.447
[inhales]

13:16.491 --> 13:17.797
Breaking up with him...

13:18.623 --> 13:20.147
especially the way I did,

13:20.190 --> 13:22.845
is the worst thing I've done,

13:22.889 --> 13:23.933
maybe ever.

13:23.977 --> 13:24.804
Regret...

13:25.543 --> 13:26.762
it haunts you.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.679
I know because
it haunts me, too.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.030
Go to your man,

13:34.074 --> 13:35.466
try to make amends,

13:35.510 --> 13:36.903
say you're sorry,

13:37.512 --> 13:38.905
ask for clemency.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.298
Regardless of how he responds,

13:41.342 --> 13:43.083
you'll feel better
having tried.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.521
[knock on door]

13:50.046 --> 13:51.569
Kevin!

13:51.613 --> 13:53.702
Hey, uh, this...
this is a surprise.

13:54.355 --> 13:55.486
Hey, Fangs.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.489
I know we haven't
talked for awhile,

13:58.533 --> 14:00.274
but I got some stuff
to get off my chest.

14:00.317 --> 14:01.666
so I hope you'll hear me out.

14:01.710 --> 14:02.972
For sure, of course,

14:03.016 --> 14:04.626
uh, just right now
isn't a good time.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.106
If I don't say it now,

14:06.149 --> 14:07.411
I'm gonna lose my nerves.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.500
-Just, just, just...
-[Fangs sighs]

14:09.936 --> 14:10.762
Kev...

14:10.806 --> 14:12.721
More baguette to the rescue.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.419
-Oh, my God.
-Kevin!

14:15.463 --> 14:16.594
Oh, my God. Moose?

14:16.638 --> 14:17.682
Hey, it's been a while, huh?

14:17.726 --> 14:19.032
[Fangs] Kev, this isn't...

14:19.075 --> 14:20.772
This isn't what it looks.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.470
You're seeing Moose Mason?

14:22.513 --> 14:24.211
We just...
we just ran into each other.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.691
Kev, why don't you sit down?

14:26.735 --> 14:29.172
Have a glass of wine,
we can talk about this.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.565
[Kevin] Yeah, no, thank you.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.872
I've got to wake up
from this nightmare

14:32.915 --> 14:35.700
in which
my ex-boyfriends
are sleeping together.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.877
[dramatic music plays]

14:38.399 --> 14:39.487
Kevin.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.011
[bombs exploding,
machine-gun fire]

14:42.969 --> 14:44.971
[Jackson groaning]

14:46.407 --> 14:48.278
Hey, Eric,

14:48.322 --> 14:49.540
I know you're tired,

14:49.584 --> 14:50.933
but you gotta wait
until nightfall,

14:50.977 --> 14:52.717
and then I could
carry you out of here.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.371
Hey, we're gonna get you help,

14:54.415 --> 14:55.720
but you gotta keep
your eyes open.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.288
[dog barks, bomb explodes]

14:58.332 --> 14:59.768
-[dog whines]
-[Eric groans]

14:59.811 --> 15:01.161
[Jackson] I'm sure this is...

15:01.988 --> 15:03.032
Is that Bingo?

15:03.076 --> 15:03.990
-[dog barks]
-Yeah.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.034
I'm gonna bring him back.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.340
Where is he?

15:06.383 --> 15:07.645
He's in the middle
of no-man's land.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.473
[mutters] That's no good.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.214
You can't go out there,
you'll get shot.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.563
I can make it if I'm fast.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.087
[bullets whizzing]

15:14.130 --> 15:16.393
You can't go out there,
Sarge, no way.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.178
I can't just ignore him, Eric.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.919
You'll die.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.138
You're my only hope
of getting out of
this foxhole alive.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.749
I can get Bingo
and I can bring him back,
and I can take you both.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.664
We're in their crosshairs.

15:26.708 --> 15:27.927
You've gotta wait them out.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.102
I have to do it,

15:29.145 --> 15:30.842
I can't just leave Bingo
out there to die.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.280
[Jackson] Sarge, no,
I won't let you.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.586
[groans and thuds]

15:35.630 --> 15:37.240
Eric, what the hell?

15:37.284 --> 15:39.547
-Sarge, you gotta help.
The dog, he's gone.
-What?

15:39.590 --> 15:41.636
He's missing,
we gotta find him.

15:45.292 --> 15:46.728
How did he get out?

15:46.771 --> 15:48.904
Hey, guys, it's okay,
calm down, I found him.

15:48.948 --> 15:49.644
Where?

15:49.687 --> 15:50.819
Come here, check it out.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.215
[soft music playing]

-[door creaks]
-[Archie exhales]

16:00.568 --> 16:01.961
[Archie]
How'd he get in there?

16:02.004 --> 16:04.137
I don't know,
I guess the door was ajar.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.617
He was looking
for a place to hide.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.097
[dog whines]

16:10.360 --> 16:12.972
[upbeat music playing]

16:13.015 --> 16:17.193
Mr. Preston,
it's Reginald Mantle
from Pearls and Posh.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.456
Boy, do I have
an exciting proposition
for you.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.720
[Veronica] Yes, Mr. Gibbs,
we're smaller than some of
the New York firms,

16:22.764 --> 16:25.462
but it means we'll work
that much harder for you.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.116
And just to be clear,

16:27.160 --> 16:30.554
though I want your business,
I don't need your business.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.904
[rock music playing]

16:32.948 --> 16:34.645
[Reggie] Look, Nolan,
there's no judgment here,

16:34.689 --> 16:36.821
if you wanna go
the target mutual funds route.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.214
I get it, it's safe.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.476
But the truth is,

16:39.520 --> 16:41.043
scared money
doesn't make money.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.480
What I'm offering you
is a sure thing.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.482
Welcome aboard, Mrs. Artemis,

16:45.526 --> 16:48.746
you will surely be bragging
to your friends at tea time
this Saturday,

16:48.790 --> 16:50.487
speak to you very, very soon.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.054
Okay, bye, bye.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.318
I just closed my fifth client.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.799
I just closed my third...
we're killing it, Ronnie.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.714
We're proving ourselves
to be capable,

16:59.757 --> 17:01.672
that's for sure. But...

17:01.716 --> 17:02.847
we need more leads to call.

17:02.891 --> 17:05.241
I'm all tapped out of names.

17:05.285 --> 17:08.027
Ronnie, what's my commission
for all the fish I'm catching?

17:08.070 --> 17:09.941
Industry standard,
five percent.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.421
If I get us some fresh leads,

17:11.465 --> 17:12.857
will you bump me
to fifteen percent?

17:12.901 --> 17:15.686
If you can really
bring in new business,

17:15.730 --> 17:17.036
ten percent.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.299
Okay then,
but there's one caveat...

17:20.822 --> 17:23.042
the leads are from SoDale.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.435
SoDale?
What are you talking about?

17:25.479 --> 17:27.176
The thing about SoDale is...

17:27.220 --> 17:28.395
it doesn't exist.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.527
It's a muddy field
with no construction.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.094
Your dad sold his investors

17:32.138 --> 17:34.618
on a vision of something
that will never be built.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.534
He's using the money
to fund his crazy search
for palladium.

17:37.578 --> 17:40.233
What about his investors?
Aren't they asking questions?

17:40.276 --> 17:42.148
Constantly.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.628
But he's always got an excuse
for why the new houses
aren't finished.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.065
So, I'm thinking...

17:46.108 --> 17:49.546
What if we go after
my father's investors?

17:49.590 --> 17:52.201
And get them
to pull out of SoDale

17:52.245 --> 17:53.637
and invest with us?

17:54.638 --> 17:56.727
Reggie... you're a genius.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.209
[chuckles]

18:00.253 --> 18:02.255
[dog barking aggressively]

18:04.431 --> 18:07.042
[Frank] Hey, it's okay,
just calm down.
Put some pressure.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.696
Uncle Frank, Eric,
what the hell happened?

18:08.739 --> 18:10.567
Eric took the dog for a walk.
They ran into a bigger dog,

18:10.611 --> 18:12.700
Our guy freaked out,
Eric tried to calm him down...

18:12.743 --> 18:13.962
And he bit my arm...

18:14.005 --> 18:15.224
Okay, okay,
that's it, we're done.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.269
Where are you going?

18:16.312 --> 18:17.618
I'm calling the shelter.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.098
Arch, please,
this is all my fault...

18:19.141 --> 18:20.751
Just give me five minutes
to clean up Eric,

18:20.795 --> 18:22.144
and I'll explain everything.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.407
[dog barks]

18:24.451 --> 18:27.584
Okay, so how is a rescue dog
biting Eric your fault?

18:27.628 --> 18:30.457
The dog that I brought home
isn't an ordinary rescue,
Archie.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.155
The woman
at the shelter told me,
based on his injuries,

18:33.199 --> 18:36.115
he was very likely
part of a dog-fighting ring.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.204
Are you kidding?

18:38.247 --> 18:40.075
That's happening here
in Riverdale?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.642
Apparently,
they started popping up
a few years ago,

18:41.685 --> 18:42.947
after everyone
began moving away,

18:42.991 --> 18:44.819
leaving their pets behind.

18:44.862 --> 18:47.778
The shelter rescues
as many as they can but...

18:47.822 --> 18:49.258
some dogs just wind up
with the wrong people.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.521
Yeah, scumbags who pit dogs
against each other,

18:51.565 --> 18:54.655
and then bet on
which ones will win
and which ones will die.

18:54.698 --> 18:55.873
I'll be back.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.789
[dramatic music plays]

19:00.095 --> 19:02.445
Mrs. Rawald, you wouldn't
have happened to invest

19:02.489 --> 19:04.708
in SoDale LLC, by any chance?

19:04.752 --> 19:09.017
Uh-huh, and how is
that investment doing,
Mr. Barry?

19:09.060 --> 19:10.975
Have you seen any houses
in SoDale?

19:11.019 --> 19:12.847
Have you seen any blueprints?

19:12.890 --> 19:14.414
I'll be honest,

19:14.457 --> 19:16.459
construction's not happening
as quickly as I'd like.

19:16.503 --> 19:19.506
Mr. Barry, I have it
on very good authority

19:19.549 --> 19:21.595
that there will never be
a SoDale.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.292
So...

19:23.336 --> 19:27.209
might I suggest
you withdraw your funds
from SoDale LLC,

19:27.253 --> 19:29.820
and invest with us
here at Pearls and Posh?

19:29.864 --> 19:31.953
You're telling me
SoDale's a scam?

19:32.736 --> 19:34.173
Can you give me a minute,

19:34.216 --> 19:35.522
I'm just getting Hiram lodge
on the other line.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.871
Chris Barry,

19:36.914 --> 19:38.655
always a pleasure
to hear your voice...

19:38.699 --> 19:39.830
how's Cindy?

19:39.874 --> 19:41.789
I'm not happy.

19:41.832 --> 19:44.139
I have a source telling me
that I made a bad investment
with you...

19:44.183 --> 19:46.228
-[Chris] SoDale.
-Whoa!

19:46.272 --> 19:47.882
That's absurd.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.189
SoDale is the finest investment
you can put your money into.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.495
In fact,
you should double-down.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.237
How does thirty percent returns
over three years sound?

19:55.281 --> 19:57.021
He's selling me
on thirty percent

19:57.065 --> 19:58.632
at three years, Ms. Posh.

19:58.675 --> 19:59.937
Can you match that?

19:59.981 --> 20:04.333
How about
an ROY of 35% at three.

20:04.377 --> 20:07.031
And I'll throw in
a glamourge egg
as a closing bonus.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.119
But that's my final offer.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.947
What do you say, Chris?

20:09.991 --> 20:13.212
This is a onetime only
exclusive FOH,
Friends of Hiram offer.

20:13.255 --> 20:17.216
Thirty-five percent
and a glamourge egg.
Okay, I'm in.

20:18.521 --> 20:21.089
Thank you, Mr. Barry.

20:21.132 --> 20:24.223
You are in good hands
here at Pearls and Posh.

20:24.266 --> 20:29.532
Sorry Lodge, but I'm pulling
out of SoDale, and if I don't
get all my money back,

20:29.576 --> 20:31.404
I'll be calling
the state attorney's office.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.014

20:49.944 --> 20:52.425

20:52.468 --> 20:55.950
We take the night off
to help Betty and Tabitha,

20:55.993 --> 21:00.041
and then we keep doing
exactly what we're doing.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.264
[Cheryl] Fangs with Moose,
you say?

21:06.439 --> 21:09.093
Yeah, I caught them having
wine and cheese.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.574
Ew, that's diabolical.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.533
Kevin, you did nothing wrong.

21:13.576 --> 21:17.450
And you brought
your sacred truth
to his profane threshold.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.234
That alone is a victory.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.932
Then why do I feel so forsaken?

21:22.672 --> 21:23.543
Mm.

21:25.588 --> 21:30.289
In godless times like these,
instead of focusing
on yourself,

21:30.332 --> 21:34.467
perhaps the only way
to know true comfort
is by comforting others.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.774
Tonight, I'm assisting
Betty and Tabitha

21:37.818 --> 21:43.345
in the most ingenious ruse
to thwart the evil goings-on
of the Lonely Highway.

21:43.389 --> 21:48.394
Work with us on this, Kevin,
and perhaps in service,

21:48.437 --> 21:51.527
you will find peace
and meaning.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.966
[Betty] Okay, gather round,
people. This is it.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.794
Hopefully, it will be
a big night.

21:57.838 --> 22:01.972
We'll be checking
everyone's IDs,
aka, writing down their names,

22:02.016 --> 22:03.844
and driver's license numbers
regardless of their age.

22:03.887 --> 22:07.282
That's after my new cameras
catch their faces coming in.

22:07.326 --> 22:11.591
Mom, you'll be working the bar,
keeping an eye out for anything
and everything sketchy.

22:11.634 --> 22:12.896
As I usually do.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.290
Hey, shouldn't Fangs be here?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.510
Isn't he managing for Toni
these days?

22:17.553 --> 22:21.383
Yeah, but he's helping Archie
with some dog thing tonight,
so Toni asked me to step in.

22:21.427 --> 22:24.168
Veronica, Cheryl, Tabitha,
and I will be performing.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.170
While we keep
the truckers busy,

22:26.214 --> 22:30.174
our stealth team of Kevin
and Reggie will be
jimmying open their trailers,

22:30.218 --> 22:32.655
inspecting their trucks,
and looking for
anything suspicious.

22:32.699 --> 22:34.396
If you find something,
I'll come check it out.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.573
Our main goal of the night
is recon.

22:37.617 --> 22:41.360
Okay? Get names, get licenses,
and cardinal rule,

22:41.403 --> 22:44.841
no one goes off alone
with any truckers. Okay?

22:44.885 --> 22:46.234
Are we ready to do this?

22:50.543 --> 22:52.675

and it's true.

to bet on dogs.

the ringleader lives.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.772

of dogfights?

23:02.816 --> 23:04.121
Not for another
couple of weeks.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.515
Enough time to loop in
Sheriff Keller.

23:06.559 --> 23:09.823
Yeah, except we're not
looping in Sheriff Keller,
or my uncle.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.216
I don't want
this scumbag arrested.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.218

23:14.262 --> 23:16.830

is saving the dogs.

we can't settle up

33:28.789 --> 33:32.010
at which point,
we will hand him over.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.280
Arch,

33:41.323 --> 33:43.238
Eric told me
the truth about Bingo.

33:44.805 --> 33:45.806
You want to talk about it?

33:47.460 --> 33:49.070
What's there to
talk about, Uncle Frank?

33:49.114 --> 33:50.854
I've been to war, Archie.

33:50.898 --> 33:53.379
I know the impossible decisions
you have to make.

33:54.293 --> 33:55.337
To hear Eric tell it,

33:55.381 --> 33:57.383
if you had gone back for Bingo,

33:57.426 --> 33:59.602
you and Eric probably
wouldn't have made it either.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.301
You made a choice
in the moment,

34:02.344 --> 34:04.042
and it was the right choice.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.480
You can't save everyone.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.570
It feels wrong.

34:12.093 --> 34:14.269
Everything feels wrong.

34:14.313 --> 34:17.272
I'm trying to save this town,
but it is so...

34:18.143 --> 34:20.232
corrupt...

34:20.275 --> 34:23.322
broken, full of awful,
despicable people.

34:23.365 --> 34:25.585
I mean, the lowest
of the lows, dog fighters.

34:27.282 --> 34:30.372
Makes me think there's
nothing worth saving here.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.461
Don't lose sight of
what you're doing, Archie.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.816
[Cheryl] Kevin,

34:39.860 --> 34:41.862
I heard you being summoned
to Weatherbee's office.

34:41.905 --> 34:44.386
Were you fired on account of
your cruising ways?

34:44.430 --> 34:47.433
No, Cheryl, actually,
the opposite.

34:47.476 --> 34:49.783
I've just been named
Teacher of the Year.

34:49.826 --> 34:52.002
Oh, but that's incredible.

34:52.046 --> 34:54.222
So why the forlorn face?

34:55.049 --> 34:56.050
Is it Fangs?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.443
Yeah.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.836
But also it's my entire life.

34:59.880 --> 35:04.102
Like, I love being a teacher,
but it was never supposed
to be my life's calling.

35:05.451 --> 35:07.496
This award is
a painful reminder

35:07.540 --> 35:09.977
of all that I haven't
accomplished, okay?

35:10.020 --> 35:14.416
I'm supposed to be in New York
writing, performing, directing.

35:14.460 --> 35:17.680
Instead, I'm in Riverdale,
still cruising the woods.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.466
Unlucky in love.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.772
Being named
Teacher of the Year
at a dying high school, okay?

35:22.816 --> 35:25.253
This can't be my life.
It just it... it can't be.

35:25.297 --> 35:29.301
I think I have an idea
that might not fix
all of your problems,

35:29.344 --> 35:32.652
but will replenish
your artist's soul.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.917
[dogs barking]

35:38.005 --> 35:40.312
Well, what do you think?

35:40.355 --> 35:42.618
Not everybody in Riverdale
is rotten, Archie.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.491
Uncle Frank, how did
you guys pull this off?

35:45.534 --> 35:47.188
Eric and I called
a couple shelters.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.885
We told 'em
we had a bunch of dogs
that needed homes.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.191
Good dogs

35:50.235 --> 35:51.845
who maybe need a little more

35:51.888 --> 35:54.282
attention and rehabilitation
before they can get adopted...

35:54.326 --> 35:56.197
because of what
they've been through.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.025
Almost gives you
hope again, huh?

35:58.068 --> 35:59.157
Almost.

36:01.028 --> 36:03.204
No, this is good.
This is great.

36:03.248 --> 36:06.773
Hey, Sarge,
you think it'd be okay
if we call him Bingo?

36:06.816 --> 36:08.862
Wouldn't be disrespectful.
Would it?

36:08.905 --> 36:10.342
No, no. Hey!

36:11.386 --> 36:12.605
We love Bingo.

36:13.823 --> 36:14.955
I think he'd be honored.

36:23.355 --> 36:24.834
Brothers and sisters,

36:24.878 --> 36:29.883
this week, I learned
a simple yet profound truth.

36:31.145 --> 36:33.452
It is in making those around us

36:33.495 --> 36:36.759
feel good that we ourselves
may find salvation,

36:37.195 --> 36:38.326
comfort.

36:38.370 --> 36:41.111
[Cheryl] Yes, comfort,
my people.

36:41.155 --> 36:43.244
Isaiah, chapter 40, verse one.

36:43.288 --> 36:46.465
As a reminder of that lesson,
today's closing hymn will be

36:46.508 --> 36:51.644
Everything is Alright
from the iconic musical
Jesus Christ Superstar

36:51.687 --> 36:53.689
and singing with me
will be our ministry's
