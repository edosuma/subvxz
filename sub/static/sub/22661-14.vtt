WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:05.239
You guys are in for
our March Madness party
this weekend, right?

00:05.273 --> 00:07.075
Jen has to work,
but she's preapproved

00:07.108 --> 00:08.509
several party jokes
for me to tell.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.443
I have a fun one about

00:09.477 --> 00:11.579
an elephant who doesn't
have to pack a bag

00:11.612 --> 00:14.182
because he already has a--
You know what, I'll save it.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.250
Oh. (sputters)
I'll go

00:16.284 --> 00:17.718
if you let me try out your
new heated toilet seat.

00:17.751 --> 00:18.652
I've been waiting
my whole life

00:18.686 --> 00:22.256
for science to invent
something useful.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.258
No, I am not letting you
up there.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.294
You'll be on it all the time,
and I won't know

00:26.327 --> 00:28.196
if the heat is from the seat
or from you.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.364
(car horn honks outside)

00:30.398 --> 00:32.333
Kids! Come on!
Your ride's here!

00:34.135 --> 00:35.803
Bye!
Bye-bye.
See ya.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.438
Love you.
Bye. Love you, too.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.207
All right, have a great day.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.742
Bye? Wh-What's happening?
(door closes)

00:41.775 --> 00:43.277
Where are my babies going?

00:43.311 --> 00:45.179
To school.
Yeah, I got them in a carpool

00:45.213 --> 00:47.281
with what's-her-name,
that mom with the husky kid

00:47.315 --> 00:49.383
that always wears
the velour tracksuits.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.353
We call him Tiny Soprano.
(chuckles)

00:53.854 --> 00:55.323
And why can't you
drive them anymore?

00:55.356 --> 00:56.790
Because I have to leave
the office early

00:56.824 --> 00:59.227
to do afternoon pickup, and
as soon as I walk out the door,

00:59.260 --> 01:01.829
Don goes to the dog track.

01:01.862 --> 01:05.199
I do do that.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.368
I didn't think
he knew it.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.303
Well, we're all
learning things today.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.738
Mm. Yeah.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.207
A carpool would make
my life so much easier.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.376
Well, we should get
to work.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.810
Unless you'd allow me
a few minutes upstairs

01:16.844 --> 01:18.312
on your new hot potty.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.314
No way.

01:20.348 --> 01:23.217
Only one king sits
on that throne.

01:25.353 --> 01:28.756
Yeah, uh, honey, I'm not
so sure about a carpool.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.859
Okay? I mean, how will I know
if the kids get home safe?

01:31.892 --> 01:34.262
I don't get home
until 5:00.

01:34.295 --> 01:38.266
That gives the kidnappers
a two-hour head start.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.600
Morning, guys.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.602
Perfect timing.
Look, I know all about

01:41.635 --> 01:43.604
your unreasonable fear
of kidnappers.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.439
That's why
Rudy's here, okay?

01:45.473 --> 01:47.208
I got him to hook us up
with some cameras.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.210
He does security
at the stadium.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.279
I like this.
Yeah, yeah.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.447
The Steelers are way more
valuable than our kids.

01:53.481 --> 01:57.785
And so far, not one of them
has been kidnapped.

01:57.818 --> 01:58.886
ANDI:
So, with the cameras,

01:58.919 --> 02:01.422
I'll know if the
kids get home safe.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.292
I am finding this practical,
organized side of you

02:04.325 --> 02:06.460
very attractive.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.429
Well, buckle up, baby,

02:08.462 --> 02:11.632
because you can watch all
of the footage from the cameras

02:11.665 --> 02:13.467
on your iPad.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.404
Now, how does the footage get
from the cameras to your iPad?

02:16.437 --> 02:18.439
Don't ask Rudy,
because he'll tell ya,

02:18.472 --> 02:19.807
and it's very boring.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.443
Yeah, it is.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.677
You know, a
lot of people

02:23.711 --> 02:25.679
like to say
that nerds are cool again,

02:25.713 --> 02:27.181
but we're not.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.317
Anyways, I put one camera

02:29.350 --> 02:30.818
over your front door

02:30.851 --> 02:33.454
and one on the garage
facing the back door.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.323
Where would you like
the last one?

02:35.356 --> 02:36.790
Uh... (gasps) Let's put
it in the living room.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.527
Yeah. Yeah, then I can figure
out which one of the kids

02:39.560 --> 02:41.662
been eating my M&M'S
and stuffing the wrappers

02:41.695 --> 02:44.665
in the couch cushions. Huh?

02:44.698 --> 02:47.435
Or we could make sure
they're doing their homework

02:47.468 --> 02:48.636
so they can go to college.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.272
And afford
their own M&M'S.
Sure!

02:51.305 --> 02:52.906
Okay, well,

02:52.940 --> 02:54.174
I'll recheck everything
in a couple of days.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.511
If you're not home, I'll just
use the key behind your planter.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.846
How do you know
about that?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.581
Because I'm in security.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.583
It's my job to know
these things.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.252
Also, you told me.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.521
But mainly it's because
I'm in security.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.457
Uh, listen, thanks so much
for all your help, Rudy.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.359
Oh, sure thing. You know,
actually, I should get going.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.361
Joy's out of town for the week,

03:13.394 --> 03:15.896
and I bought a giant ham
for dinner. (chuckles)

03:15.929 --> 03:17.465
Yeah, we're
gonna have

03:17.498 --> 03:18.566
a session.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.269
I'm sorry, wh...

03:21.302 --> 03:22.470
why can't you eat that
when Joy's around?

03:22.503 --> 03:25.439
(sighs) Because I like it
too much and she gets jealous.

03:25.473 --> 03:28.309
"Why don't you put that ham
down and come over here

03:28.342 --> 03:30.311
and snuggle with me?"

03:30.344 --> 03:32.580
That's all I hear.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.016
(door opens, closes)

03:36.049 --> 03:38.852
Hmm. You know,
in a weird way,

03:38.886 --> 03:40.688
that was a very sweet story.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.690
Yeah, um, he...

03:42.723 --> 03:45.726
he's gonna eat
the ham, right?

03:48.996 --> 03:50.498
Hey. So, you'll never
guess what I saw

03:50.531 --> 03:51.765
the kids doing today
on the cameras.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.335
Were they eating
my M&M'S?

03:54.368 --> 03:57.505
Sorry, babe, that-that
case remains unsolved.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.708
They just came home and
started doing their homework

04:00.741 --> 04:03.010
without anybody telling them to.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.678
What?

04:04.712 --> 04:07.715
We're the greatest parents
in the world, and it's on video.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.585
Oh. Let me check
the back door footage. I, uh...

04:11.619 --> 04:13.421
I think a raccoon's
been digging up our flowers,

04:13.454 --> 04:15.289
and I don't want
to accuse him without proof.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.557
Otherwise, I'll look
like an idiot.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.326
Well, yeah.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.328
Oh, look.
(chuckles)

04:20.361 --> 04:22.496
You can see me doing dishes
in the kitchen window.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.532
Yeah. (chuckles)
(chuckles)

04:24.565 --> 04:26.567
Uh-oh.
Huh?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.437
Was this after the kids
went to bed last night?

04:29.470 --> 04:30.738
Mm-hmm.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.573
Oh.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.375
Am I about to come up
behind you?

04:38.446 --> 04:39.547
BOTH:
Oh, no!

04:39.580 --> 04:41.315
(both gasp)

04:41.349 --> 04:42.750
Oh!

04:42.783 --> 04:45.719
We accidentally made
an S-E-X tape!

04:45.753 --> 04:47.955
And here we go.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.823
Oh...

04:53.126 --> 04:55.529
Huh.

04:55.563 --> 04:58.632
Not bad.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.734
(chuckles)
Not bad yourself.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.736
I was talking about me.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.805
Oh, okay, let's start
it from the beginning.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.807
I want to watch it
when I'm not scared.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.842
(chuckles)

05:09.943 --> 05:12.546
*

05:23.056 --> 05:24.792
(phone rings)
Hey, honey.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.794
How's it going, movie star?

05:26.827 --> 05:30.431
(chuckles) Well, it's not
as exciting as last night,

05:30.464 --> 05:31.899
Best Supporting Actor.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.502
Supporting Actor?

05:34.535 --> 05:35.903
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.138
At one point,
I did have to support you.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.940
Any-Anyway,

05:39.973 --> 05:42.876
I left a present for you.
Check your downloaded videos.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.912
Huh?

05:45.913 --> 05:49.116
(gasps)

05:49.149 --> 05:51.985
(quietly):
Our secret video? You saved it?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.020
I thought you might like it.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.955
Well, meet me at home for lunch.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.957
I'll show you exactly
how I feel about it.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.959
I can't wait. (chuckles)

05:58.992 --> 06:00.461
Hold on, hold on.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.162
Are we gonna do
what I think we're gonna do?

06:02.195 --> 06:05.098
'Cause I don't want to skip
lunch just to get yelled at.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.401
(door opens)

06:07.435 --> 06:09.470
Ah, there she is.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.039
Huh? I'm a big fan.
I've seen all your movie.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.041
(laughs)

06:14.074 --> 06:16.644
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe this worked.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.912
Well, it did.
But after, delete this video.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.615
Or, or we have
a few cameras.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.184
We could do a whole series.
You love to binge watch.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.054
Okay the more you talk about
this, the less it's working.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.822
Okay, okay, you're right.
I promise I'll delete it.

06:28.856 --> 06:29.890
Let's keep this train moving.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.959
Okay.
Choo-choo!

06:31.992 --> 06:33.927
You're right, I'll save the
train noises for the bedroom.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.796
Oh...

06:47.074 --> 06:49.142
Uh, where's Mom's iPad?

06:49.176 --> 06:50.511
Uh, none of you guys
have it, do ya?

06:50.544 --> 06:51.912
'Cause private stuff on there.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.482
I mean, like, taxes, and...

06:54.515 --> 06:57.084
other grown-up words.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.119
Grandma came by
and borrowed it.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.455
Grandma has it?

07:01.489 --> 07:03.591
She said she was playing a mean
game of Words With Friends

07:03.624 --> 07:04.925
and broke hers.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.894
When did this happen?
Where was I?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.896
Upstairs with your
new toilet seat.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.531
(scoffs)

07:10.564 --> 07:12.500
Okay, Andi...
Hey.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.536
How are my perfect angels?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.938
Y-You're talking to us?

07:17.971 --> 07:20.508
Uh, Andi, I-I need a word.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.544
It's about the special
present on your iPad.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.945
Oh, what present?
I want to see!

07:24.978 --> 07:26.647
No, you don't.
You'll never be the same.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.850
What's wrong?

07:29.883 --> 07:31.519
You are gonna love this.
(chuckles)

07:31.552 --> 07:33.086
Remember that time you
told me to get milk,

07:33.120 --> 07:34.855
but I didn't?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.190
Well, we have a similar
situation here, okay?

07:37.224 --> 07:39.960
But the milk is
our naked bodies.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.730
And my mom has the milk.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.698
Wait, what?

07:44.732 --> 07:46.266
My mom took your iPad.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.569
Well, you deleted
the video, right?

07:48.602 --> 07:50.804
Yes, yes. I pulled you
out here on the porch

07:50.838 --> 07:52.873
to tell you
everything's fine.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.208
How could you not
delete the video?

07:55.242 --> 07:57.978
I-I thought it'd be fun to put
some music under it, you know?

07:58.011 --> 08:01.048
Like... like, uh...
like Chariots of Fire,

08:01.081 --> 08:02.816
or "For Those
About to Rock."

08:02.850 --> 08:05.085
You know, pretty
spicy, right?

08:05.118 --> 08:08.155
Spicy? What...
Where are you getting this?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.723
I was at the
dentist last week,

08:09.757 --> 08:11.258
reading one of those
women's magazines,

08:11.291 --> 08:14.127
and there was an article about
keeping relationships spicy.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.796
And one of the things
it said was,

08:15.829 --> 08:18.131
"Don't be afraid to
surprise your partner."

08:18.165 --> 08:21.001
So, surprise!

08:21.034 --> 08:22.970
Okay, honey,
I have told you,

08:23.003 --> 08:26.073
those women's magazines
are not for you.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.808
Okay?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.977
Those ideas, they go
inside your man brain

08:30.010 --> 08:32.680
and they bang around in there,
and then... and then

08:32.713 --> 08:35.148
they come out
all naked and dirty.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.318
I didn't hear you complaining
by the kitchen sink.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.820
Adam!

08:39.853 --> 08:42.155
We have to get
that video back right now.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.257
Okay, okay. I was just
trying to spice things up.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.560
And you got to admit,
for a minute, it worked.

08:46.594 --> 08:49.162
Well, it was definitely
more than a minute, but...

08:49.196 --> 08:51.164
that's just a figure
of speech.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.234
I don't have to tell you.
You were there. Okay.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.204
Hey, uh, where's Mom?

08:57.237 --> 08:59.006
She's right...

08:59.039 --> 09:02.309
Oh. I guess she went out.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.578
I'm watching soap operas
for no reason.

09:04.612 --> 09:07.214
Uh, have you seen
my iPad?

09:07.247 --> 09:09.316
She borrowed it,
and we need it back.

09:09.349 --> 09:12.019
Oh. Well, here you go.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.989
No, no, an iPad.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.059
That's a pad. I gave it to you.
Now it's your pad.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.763
No, it-it's like
a little computer.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.297
It's more of a tablet.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.332
Like the Ten Commandments?

09:27.134 --> 09:28.869
This could take years.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.138
It's that square thing
she's always yelling at.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.840
Oh, that.
Mm.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.042
Well, hers broke,
so she borrowed yours.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.044
We know.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.212
That's where we started.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.616
Well, then, give me that back.
It's my pad.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.017
(groans)

09:44.051 --> 09:46.887
Just... (chuckles) tell us
where the computer is.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.321
Well, she gave it to Don

09:48.355 --> 09:50.290
so Don could give it
back to you at work.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.259
Don?
Great.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.894
If he has it,
they're probably already

09:53.927 --> 09:55.996
selling it at truck stops.
Come on.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.300
Don! Don! Uh...

10:00.333 --> 10:01.869
Oh, no, no,
he's not here.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.837
He went over to Rudy's
to visit a ham.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.840
I don't ask questions anymore.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.977
Um, did he leave
my iPad by any chance?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.211
Oh, yes, it's right here.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.013
Oh, thank God.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.849
I do not enjoy tiny computers.
They make me feel like a giant.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.317
(chuckles)

10:17.350 --> 10:20.087
No, no, no.
This-this isn't mine.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.154
That's Lowell's.
Lowell was here earlier.

10:21.188 --> 10:24.324
I guess they got them mixed up,
and he took yours.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.894
Lowell? That's
worse than Don.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.228
I'm his hero.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.330
Nobody wants to see
Superman without his cape!

10:30.363 --> 10:32.866
Or his underwear.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.371
Lowell?
(clears throat)

10:38.405 --> 10:40.007
Hi.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.008
Hi.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.376
Hi. (chuckles)

10:43.410 --> 10:44.878
Hey.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.280
Oh, uh, i-is Lowell here?

10:47.314 --> 10:50.050
Uh, no, he's not here.
I'm Heather. I'm the new nanny.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.352
Outstanding.
Uh, listen, if you're looking

10:52.385 --> 10:54.354
for some extra work, I got
some gutters at my place...

10:54.387 --> 10:56.389
All right, all right, all right.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.026
Uh, we're Lowell's friends,
Adam and Andi,

10:59.059 --> 11:01.695
and he has my iPad.
H-Have you seen it?

11:01.729 --> 11:03.363
Oh, yes, he took it
with him to the gym.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.698
He said he'd bring it
by your party.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.701
That's not good enough.
I need it now!

11:07.735 --> 11:09.436
She-she just really
needs her computer, okay?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.271
She's an online
gambler. Yeah.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.240
And we don't like to talk
about it. It's very painful.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.274
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.411
We have to call Lowell
and track him down.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.980
Okay? O-Or...

11:20.013 --> 11:21.248
or we could report
his car stolen,

11:21.281 --> 11:23.016
let the cops do the work for us.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.317
We'll just get it
at the party.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.153
We don't need
to panic. Okay?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.821
We're married, and
we have children.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.390
The secret's out that we
like to bow-chicka-bow-bow.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.462
Okay, but word about this video
will spread, all right?

11:35.495 --> 11:37.798
It'll be the thing
that we become known for.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.133
I mean, people will read
my obituary, and they'll say,

11:40.167 --> 11:41.902
"Aw, Sex Tape Andi died.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.873
Yeah, and she's survived
by her husband, Sex Tape Adam."

11:45.906 --> 11:48.075
I don't want
to be Sex Tape Adam.

11:48.108 --> 11:51.011
Who's gonna marry Sex Tape Adam?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.345
You're getting married already?

11:52.379 --> 11:54.347
You just told me you're dead.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.316
If you don't find my iPad,

11:56.349 --> 11:58.886
I'm gonna be known
as Killed Her Husband Andi.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.487
Let's go.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.455
(sportscast playing,
excited shouting)

12:02.489 --> 12:04.057
Yes!
(knocking on door)

12:04.091 --> 12:07.460
Oh! That's Lowell.
Get it, get it, get it.
Okay.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.229
Rudy. Hey...

12:09.262 --> 12:11.331
Oh. Boy, you don't look so good.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.466
I need you to take my ham.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.970
I have no self-control
without Joy.

12:17.004 --> 12:20.007
I ate so much
that I went up a sock size.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.942
I-I'll put it in
the fridge for you.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.411
Uh, no-- that's okay.
I'll do it.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.446
She likes the middle shelf.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.916
(knocking on door)

12:28.949 --> 12:30.150
Oh.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.484
Lowell. H-Hey.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.986
Come on in, buddy.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.789
I'm marching in,
ready for madness.

12:35.823 --> 12:36.924
(laughs) Give me that.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.458
(chuckles)

12:38.491 --> 12:41.261
Listen, you have got to tell
people when you get a new nanny.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.796
I made an ass of myself.

12:42.830 --> 12:46.299
All right, eat something. Okay.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.335
I'm gonna miss you, baby.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.206
Okay, you dodged a serious
bullet here, mister.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.208
Now delete this video
so I can sleep in peace.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.810
Okay. Right, right,
right, right.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.812
(sighs)
What...

12:58.846 --> 13:00.848
Why'd you pause it
halfway through?

13:00.881 --> 13:03.283
My best moves
are at the end.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.518
Wha... What? No, I-I
didn't watch any of it.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.354
No, uh, see?
The video's been played,

13:07.387 --> 13:09.222
and then paused in the middle.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.358
That means someone
else watched it.

13:11.391 --> 13:15.228
Someone... in there.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.402
Maybe I should have just
driven the kids to school.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.437
You think?

13:32.345 --> 13:35.883
Okay. Your mom, Don and Lowell,
they all had my iPad.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.317
Any one of them could've
watched our movie.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.119
Well, maybe they didn't
know it was us.

13:43.190 --> 13:48.195
Adam, you named the file
"Andi Does Dishes and More."

13:48.228 --> 13:50.530
O-Okay, here's what we do:
we split up

13:50.563 --> 13:53.533
and find out
who watched it, then...

13:53.566 --> 13:56.236
we come up with a real plan.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.338
I'm in. Yeah, uh...

13:58.371 --> 13:59.907
Which one us has
to talk to your mom?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.241
Not it.
Not it! Dang it!

14:01.274 --> 14:02.575
Ah.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.111
Yeah. I'm quick.
(imitates gunshot)

14:04.144 --> 14:05.278
Talk to my mother.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.416
So, Lowell.

14:09.449 --> 14:13.586
(chuckles): I have seen
some crazy stuff on iPads.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.256
Now you say something.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.458
I like that shirt, Bev.
(chuckles)

14:18.491 --> 14:21.428
Did you buy it on the iPad?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.263
If you're talking
about your iPad,

14:23.296 --> 14:25.098
I only have one thing to say.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.635
What I saw on there
was deeply disappointing.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.403
BEV:
I know what you're getting at,

14:30.437 --> 14:32.272
and I don't want
to talk about it.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.308
I'm embarrassed enough as it is.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.311
Andi!

14:38.345 --> 14:39.479
Adam!

14:39.512 --> 14:41.314
Lowell definitely
watched it.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.449
Well, your mom
watched it, too.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.484
Wha...
Yeah. I think she no
longer thinks my meat loaf

14:44.517 --> 14:46.386
is the worst thing I've
ever done in the kitchen.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.021
(scoffs)

14:48.055 --> 14:50.357
What are you guys
doing in here?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.059
Nothing! W-We've never
done anything here,

14:52.092 --> 14:55.462
especially by the sink.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.231
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

14:58.265 --> 15:01.334
Look, we all know
what was on that computer.

15:01.368 --> 15:05.305
It's natural, it's human,
and yes, it was hot.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.409
Congratulations to you both.

15:16.283 --> 15:20.420
They all watched it!

15:20.453 --> 15:24.591
And my brother liked it.

15:24.624 --> 15:28.128
Oh, they're probably in there
talking about it right now.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.297
(laughter)

15:30.330 --> 15:33.533
Oh, okay, okay, no, no,
they're-they're not talking.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.302
(chuckles):
They're laughing.

15:35.335 --> 15:39.172
Andi, they're not talking,
they're laughing!

15:39.206 --> 15:41.241
Okay, well, y-you got to go
in there and-and clear the air.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.442
Otherwise, every time
we hear them laugh,

15:42.475 --> 15:44.111
we'll know they're
laughing at you.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.446
Wha...?

15:46.479 --> 15:49.649
Uh, what do you mean,
laughing at me?

15:49.682 --> 15:51.418
Oh, it's ju...
it's just, you know,

15:51.451 --> 15:53.020
you're so serious on the video.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.754
You know? It's like,
I'm having a good time,

15:54.787 --> 15:57.624
and-and you look like
you're trying to land a plane.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.395
I need Joy
to come home.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.432
Without her, I overeat,
I don't do laundry.

16:05.465 --> 16:10.003
I'm wearing a bathing
suit as underwear.

16:10.037 --> 16:13.040
Voice of experience:
when you run out of swim trunks,

16:13.073 --> 16:17.244
you'll start dipping
into her underwear.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.346
That's when it gets weird.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.684
(TV turns off)
Whoa, whoa!
Hey!

16:24.717 --> 16:27.520
All right, all right,
listen up, listen up. Um...

16:27.554 --> 16:31.324
Love is complicated,
so sometimes you have to do

16:31.358 --> 16:34.727
some pretty crazy stuff to keep
things spicy, am I right?

16:36.396 --> 16:39.466
I think this is how
swinger parties start.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.670
I'm gonna move slowly
towards the door

16:43.703 --> 16:45.705
and try not to look sexy.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.042
Lowell, it's not
a swinger party.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.277
My parents are here.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.379
Okay, look,

16:52.412 --> 16:54.481
big deal, we made a sex tape.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.615
You-you what?

16:55.648 --> 16:57.750
We know you saw it, Ma.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.386
I didn't see anything.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.755
But I'm sure
you were great, honey.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.558
Wha...? W-Why did you tell
me you were embarrassed

17:05.592 --> 17:07.460
to talk about my iPad?

17:07.494 --> 17:10.597
'Cause I spilled coffee on it,
thought I broke it.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.400
Oh. Well, unfortunately,
you didn't.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.468
It still plays fine.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.171
Why are you
telling us all this?

17:18.205 --> 17:19.339
Because you saw it.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.208
You said you were
disappointed.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.043
Andi was doing
the best she could.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.814
I was disappointed
because I read in your e-mails

17:27.847 --> 17:30.150
that you invited Don
to your March Madness party

17:30.183 --> 17:31.684
a full week before me.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.586
You went through
my e-mails?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.257
Hey, I'm not on trial here!

17:37.290 --> 17:39.259
You're the ones
with the sex tape.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.729
All right, I-I know
Don definitely saw it.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.397
Well, first of all,

17:44.431 --> 17:46.499
thank you for such a delightful
and moving speech.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.834
But...

17:47.867 --> 17:49.836
I have not seen
the film in question.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.404
You said it was hot.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.073
I was talking about
your heated toilet seat.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.511
Rudy told me you put in cameras
so I thought you saw me

17:58.545 --> 18:00.513
when I stopped by for a test
drive when you weren't there.

18:02.149 --> 18:06.119
Little tip:
don't turn it up to ten. Oof.

18:08.488 --> 18:12.492
Okay, so n-nobody
knew about the video,

18:12.525 --> 18:16.196
but now you do, because
we just told you.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.532
(chuckles) Look at Sex Tape Andi
trying to put it together.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.369
I told you they'd call
us that! I told you.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.604
JOE:
Don't be ashamed, son.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.141
Your mom and I, we-we made a
Super 8 back in the '70s, huh?

18:28.175 --> 18:30.543
We enjoyed it.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.845
We had some good times with it,
until I accidentally sold it

18:32.879 --> 18:34.214
at a yard sale.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.485
Best 50 cents
that guy ever spent.
Yeah.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.696
Hey, so if nobody
watched the video,

18:49.729 --> 18:51.931
why was it paused
halfway through?

18:51.964 --> 18:55.635
(scoffs) I don't know why anyone
would pause that masterpiece.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.304
It was probably a glitch.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.605
A glitch? Is that a thing?

18:58.638 --> 19:00.307
I'd like to think so. Yeah.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.608
(stammers)
You know, it doesn't matter.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.775
It's deleted.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.943
(sighs)

19:03.976 --> 19:06.879
But I will never delete it...
from here.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.815
(laughs)

19:08.848 --> 19:12.819
So, um, do you really think
we need to spice things up?

19:12.852 --> 19:15.622
I mean, I thought
we were pretty spicy already.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.492
Uh, we are, yeah, but there's
no such thing as too spicy.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.461
Huh? I mean, I only
have two moves:

19:21.494 --> 19:24.397
The Go Fast and
the Catch My Breath.

19:24.431 --> 19:25.532
(knocking on door)

19:25.565 --> 19:27.400
ADAM:
Hey, Rudy.
Hey, guys.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.535
How's it going?

19:28.568 --> 19:29.602
Not too good.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.672
I don't even have a fitted sheet
on my bed anymore.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.342
I've hit rock bottom,

19:35.375 --> 19:37.477
and I thought, "You know
what would be great down here?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.678
Some ham."

19:38.711 --> 19:40.580
Hey, uh...

19:40.613 --> 19:42.415
Buddy, I-I don't think we can

19:42.449 --> 19:45.218
give this back; you got a bit
of a self-control issue.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.254
I have a self-control issue?

19:47.287 --> 19:49.422
You won't even let
your wife do the dishes

19:49.456 --> 19:50.557
without jumping her bones.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.392
(gasps)

19:53.560 --> 19:55.362
You watched it?

19:55.395 --> 19:56.696
And it was you
who paused it.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.831
Why would you pause it?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.433
That's not important.
Go ahead, honey.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.870
Well, h-how did
you see it?

20:03.903 --> 20:06.373
Well, I came by to check
on the security system,

20:06.406 --> 20:08.575
and I opened your iPad
and up popped the video

20:08.608 --> 20:10.277
of you two getting freaky.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.446
Swinging a towel, and...

20:13.480 --> 20:15.282
bubbles flying everywhere...
ANDI: Okay, okay.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.016
That's enough.
Yeah, that towel thing

20:17.049 --> 20:18.918
just kind of came
to me in the moment.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.020
Yeah.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.389
I can't believe
this happened.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.456
So, anyways,

20:23.490 --> 20:25.658
I paused it-- sorry...

20:27.427 --> 20:29.596
...and then I left.
I wouldn't have said anything,

20:29.629 --> 20:31.731
but you guys started
ham-shaming me.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.304
Okay, I-I'll
tell you what.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.872
We'll give you this back

20:39.906 --> 20:42.409
if you swear to never
speak of that video again.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.943
Don't worry, everything
that happened this week,

20:43.976 --> 20:45.745
I am taking to the grave.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.480
Which could be pretty soon,

20:47.514 --> 20:49.682
because my heart is beating
twice as fast now.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.454
(door closes)

20:54.487 --> 20:55.655
Well, there goes a man

20:55.688 --> 20:57.990
who's gonna wake up
next to a ham.
Oh.
