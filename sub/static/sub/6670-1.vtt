WEBVTT

00:15.586 --> 00:19.356
Hundred years ago, the Titans
suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

00:19.527 --> 00:23.262
They eaten most of the humans and
caused the civilization to collapse.

00:24.470 --> 00:26.874
The remnants of this war with Titans

00:26.875 --> 00:29.345
build three huge walls

00:29.379 --> 00:33.787
in order to ensure stability
and peaceful life within.

00:34.256 --> 00:35.485
Eren!

00:35.859 --> 00:38.523
Don't be afraid, it's a dud.

00:38.664 --> 00:40.897
This blue color, that must be the ocean.

00:41.337 --> 00:43.239
It's really out there.

00:43.307 --> 00:46.711
The bird should have seen the ocean, right?

00:46.747 --> 00:48.016
We were born inside the walls

00:48.017 --> 00:49.383
does it mean we will also die there?

00:49.620 --> 00:50.645
Is that okay?

00:50.755 --> 00:52.247
We will soon begin to
scout outside the wall

00:52.459 --> 00:53.860
and we will find a new land

00:53.861 --> 00:55.558
where we will be able to live freely.

00:55.698 --> 00:57.258
Nobody knew

00:58.437 --> 00:59.837
that our peace was only...

01:02.344 --> 01:06.547
... a prelude to despair.

01:06.987 --> 01:08.854
The legends are true!

01:14.335 --> 01:16.498
I have personally seen
the end of the world.

01:17.408 --> 01:21.746
Filled with the smell of
blood, ugly, noisy hell.

01:23.887 --> 01:27.793
In the end where did they come from,
but also where are they going?

01:28.396 --> 01:29.864
Mikasa!

01:32.438 --> 01:36.970
At the edge of hell, Eren even lost Mikasa.

01:38.650 --> 01:40.346
With trampled promises,

01:41.723 --> 01:43.555
deprived of future

01:44.060 --> 01:45.688
and crushed dreams,

01:46.665 --> 01:50.469
we have however yet to give
up the last glimmers of hope.

01:50.606 --> 01:52.473
In order to retrieve the
land that was taken away,

01:52.643 --> 01:56.947
the repair of the damaged
wall is our priority.

01:57.052 --> 02:00.090
We would blow a part of the
wall and fill up the hole,

02:00.091 --> 02:01.651
that was is our mission.

02:01.695 --> 02:04.291
But how, even Scout Corps
have been wiped out.

02:04.434 --> 02:07.463
If we fail, the human race
would become extinct.

02:07.573 --> 02:10.739
Now we have the Three-dimensional
Maneuvering Equipment!

02:10.846 --> 02:14.341
We decided to challenge human destiny.

02:14.453 --> 02:15.922
Give your hearts!

02:16.992 --> 02:19.724
After all the darkness, is it
doubtful whether there will be dawn?

02:19.831 --> 02:22.301
No one wants to start loosing fight.

02:23.438 --> 02:24.770
A Titan's body is not immortal.

02:24.873 --> 02:29.645
Once sustained serious neck
injuries, it will be killed.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.922
Everyone was saved from the
Titans and despair by the hero

02:32.923 --> 02:34.090
Shikishima captain.

02:34.091 --> 02:36.585
You have to find a good woman
as a partner in this fight.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.091
And the one that stood beside him

02:40.103 --> 02:41.470
was Mikasa.

02:41.574 --> 02:43.042
The world is cruel.

02:43.477 --> 02:44.946
I just kill Titans, nothing more.

02:44.947 --> 02:48.751
Mikasa obviously changed
into a different person,

02:49.388 --> 02:51.722
leaving Eren confused and disappointed.

02:51.827 --> 02:53.956
Would you be my daughter's father?

02:54.866 --> 02:55.765
Hiana!

02:58.006 --> 02:59.133
I want to defeat the Titans.

02:59.709 --> 03:01.007
Then fly out.

03:02.748 --> 03:04.445
Our true enemy

03:05.888 --> 03:09.658
arenât those Titans, it is safety.

03:09.762 --> 03:13.862
Humans are constantly suppressed
by the invasion of Titans.

03:14.572 --> 03:15.904
Our remaining dynamite! - Don't!

03:16.008 --> 03:18.775
Helpless and aimlessly fleeing soldiers.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.375
I will not let you die in this place!

03:23.924 --> 03:24.914
Eren, he was

03:25.059 --> 03:26.357
eaten...

03:26.461 --> 03:28.897
The mission has not changed,
defeat the Titans!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.095
You can't! You're almost out of gas!

03:31.405 --> 03:34.400
Maybe we should just be annihilated

03:36.013 --> 03:37.607
Maybe that supposed to happen...

03:38.151 --> 03:40.987
I'll slaughter all of you!

03:46.802 --> 03:48.704
A Titan attacking a Titan?

03:52.446 --> 03:55.145
Look at his movements, he
has the ability to think!

03:55.452 --> 04:00.656
Even revenge cannot mend a broken heart.

04:01.530 --> 04:03.659
I'm seeing one like this
for the first time, ah!

04:03.801 --> 04:05.668
Gradually losing the true self.

04:05.805 --> 04:07.508
Is he on our side?

04:07.509 --> 04:08.910
There is no way he is with us.

04:08.911 --> 04:10.778
Compulsive feelings.

04:10.882 --> 04:11.815
Eren?

04:13.955 --> 04:15.424
Cut its neck!

04:15.558 --> 04:17.423
If you don't hurry up his
cells will be assimilated.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.795
Where did they come from?

04:21.904 --> 04:23.703
Where should we go from here?

04:26.646 --> 04:28.741
Should we continue to fight,
have the opportunity to win

04:29.185 --> 04:30.710
or will there be only a last survivor,

04:32.458 --> 04:33.585
which one will be it?

05:28.969 --> 05:30.871
It will hurt a little bit.

05:38.521 --> 05:39.784
Good boy.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.809
What are you doing to our son?

05:49.810 --> 05:52.543
Don't worry, the experiment was
successful on other children.

05:54.753 --> 05:58.055
I want to know the key to
trigger cell division.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.096
So are you still a father?

06:02.703 --> 06:04.001
Open the door!

06:10.851 --> 06:11.876
Open the door!

06:13.223 --> 06:14.919
Doctor, open the door.

06:16.229 --> 06:17.197
Open it now.

06:17.498 --> 06:18.633
Please, take care of Eren.

06:18.634 --> 06:19.624
I will.

06:27.752 --> 06:30.222
More books than in a library.

06:31.626 --> 06:32.821
Doctor

06:33.129 --> 06:36.101
it must have been hard to collect so many.

06:36.235 --> 06:38.968
For centuries we have swept so hard.

06:40.243 --> 06:41.233
Stop!

06:43.916 --> 06:44.815
Don't!

06:44.918 --> 06:46.683
It's a violation of the specific
knowledge protection law.

06:46.789 --> 06:47.848
Let me go!

06:48.659 --> 06:50.686
Stop!

07:43.033 --> 07:44.626
Silly,

07:46.039 --> 07:47.632
don't you think so?

07:49.779 --> 07:51.305
Humans

07:52.652 --> 07:55.317
troubles in this world has been endlessly.

07:55.925 --> 07:59.159
Someone always wanted be
stronger, richer than others.

08:00.334 --> 08:05.606
Thus the invention of weapons,
the development of science.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.145
The augmented knowledge.

08:10.788 --> 08:15.161
When will those conflicts stop?

08:19.705 --> 08:21.641
Others said in the past:

08:22.310 --> 08:24.847
"When a common enemy appears

08:24.848 --> 08:27.649
humanity will unite as one"

08:29.391 --> 08:31.384
Hundred years ago

08:31.896 --> 08:34.833
such an enemy really appeared,

08:35.937 --> 08:37.166
the Titans!

08:39.678 --> 08:41.212
With humanity endangered

08:41.214 --> 08:43.947
our ancestors erected high walls

08:44.086 --> 08:47.786
and imprisoned themselves inside.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.957
However it was good.

08:51.100 --> 08:54.339
Limited land, food, resources

08:54.340 --> 08:56.367
caused careful distribution of those goods.

08:57.179 --> 08:59.843
There were no disputes, we we're all equal.

09:00.686 --> 09:05.184
People bonded together.

09:05.328 --> 09:08.927
But in time our hearts became rich again.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.802
So we started to fight over

09:12.075 --> 09:14.913
sources of knowledge, science

09:14.914 --> 09:16.280
and technical specifications,

09:16.316 --> 09:21.725
thinking that eternal peace will come.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.365
But...

09:24.366 --> 09:27.133
if a human have become a
Titan, what do you do?

09:29.843 --> 09:31.244
I ask you,

09:32.248 --> 09:35.982
are you a human or a Titan?

09:41.733 --> 09:45.039
Are you a human or a Titan?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.839
I asked you a question.

09:52.087 --> 09:55.355
I'm human...

09:59.501 --> 10:05.776
If a human loses a limb
it will not regenerate.

10:20.476 --> 10:23.471
You became a Titan,

10:24.250 --> 10:26.053
you came out of a Titan,

10:26.054 --> 10:28.354
everyone saw you...

10:29.360 --> 10:31.091
I'm human!

10:31.831 --> 10:33.198
Right!

10:39.112 --> 10:40.809
I am a human, right?

10:51.069 --> 10:52.868
Where is captain Shikishima?

10:53.073 --> 10:58.539
He was last reported seen
falling dawn from a wall

10:58.885 --> 11:00.854
right after the failure with explosives.

11:02.091 --> 11:03.787
I'm very sorry...

11:06.233 --> 11:07.826
Shoot him.

11:08.504 --> 11:09.494
Hey!

11:27.140 --> 11:28.871
Eren, he is human.

11:29.144 --> 11:30.544
He is our fellow soldier.

11:30.882 --> 11:34.150
He cleared the surrounding area of Titians.

11:34.421 --> 11:35.411
I see...

11:39.030 --> 11:40.260
I can...

11:42.136 --> 11:43.901
beat Titians.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.145
By now we have sacrificed so many people,

11:47.146 --> 11:50.586
but we can win if Eren fights with us.

11:51.923 --> 11:55.453
Eren is humanity's last hope!

11:55.596 --> 11:58.033
Sir, I am against it!

11:58.135 --> 12:00.672
This boy is a very precious
observation subject.

12:00.673 --> 12:03.144
He is an intelligent Titian!

12:03.278 --> 12:05.544
We may be even able to unravel
the mystery of the Titans,

12:05.883 --> 12:08.855
also perform vivisections, that's so great!

12:09.190 --> 12:10.491
Hey, really that's enough.

12:10.492 --> 12:12.860
Nevertheless, how can we
fill the hole in the wall?

12:13.565 --> 12:16.035
Our remaining explosives are gone.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.506
We have no way to collapse the wall.

12:20.011 --> 12:22.277
No... there is a way!

12:33.437 --> 12:36.102
Don't be afraid, it's a dud.

12:36.410 --> 12:37.578
A dud bomb...

12:37.579 --> 12:39.071
Give me some details!

12:41.687 --> 12:44.420
Delaying tactics are useless.

12:44.559 --> 12:47.052
You are rebels.

12:47.966 --> 12:50.061
Rebels?

12:53.376 --> 12:56.508
This is something your partner left.

12:57.719 --> 13:01.158
Sir, this belongs to the bomb thief!

13:02.261 --> 13:05.256
Even in the past the central
government was aware

13:05.600 --> 13:09.939
that thereâre those who will attempt
to topple the institutional forces

13:11.179 --> 13:15.119
beginning with our weapons.

13:21.131 --> 13:22.566
Just like everyone worried

13:23.135 --> 13:28.043
the rebel forces sneaked into the base.

13:31.151 --> 13:35.251
The seeds of evil must be removed,

13:37.430 --> 13:39.662
before they start to blossom.

13:44.244 --> 13:45.473
Let it go.

13:46.181 --> 13:49.176
If you die, what will your brother do?

13:54.096 --> 13:55.155
Mikasa,

13:56.066 --> 13:57.159
what will you do?

13:59.607 --> 14:01.371
Will you abandon Eren?

14:28.096 --> 14:29.998
Well, then shoot me!

14:33.440 --> 14:37.210
My heart is already in pieces!

14:37.581 --> 14:38.709
Armin!

14:44.795 --> 14:47.289
Damn you old man!

14:48.270 --> 14:50.797
You don't have even the
courage to bet on me!

14:51.809 --> 14:54.041
There you have it, your true
nature finally revealed.

14:55.684 --> 14:57.677
Because I was born inside the walls

14:57.788 --> 15:00.419
I thought that this life has no meaning.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.538
Eren...

15:11.181 --> 15:15.281
I finally know what I'm supposed to do,

15:16.358 --> 15:21.323
so don't hinder me, please!

15:30.118 --> 15:32.054
Even the squad leader will defend him?

15:32.690 --> 15:35.320
He's a monster and will eat you.

15:36.297 --> 15:38.062
This guy is not wrong!

15:40.706 --> 15:44.236
Certain time after the cerebral
cortex begin to decompose

15:44.446 --> 15:46.746
instinct begins to control consciousness

15:47.319 --> 15:48.787
and after a little longer

15:49.390 --> 15:51.792
the body cells will be
assimilated by the Titan.

15:58.674 --> 15:59.733
Mr. Souda

15:59.843 --> 16:00.776
Uncle...

16:12.168 --> 16:14.138
A drunk talking nonsense.

16:20.317 --> 16:22.480
Eren... Eren...

16:28.533 --> 16:32.371
Your brother... he...

17:04.337 --> 17:05.327
Shot!

17:13.489 --> 17:15.652
Another "one like this" came out!

17:15.760 --> 17:17.662
Is now the time to say it?

17:18.832 --> 17:20.130
Sir!

17:20.234 --> 17:21.469
Commander Kubal has died.

17:21.470 --> 17:22.571
Now I'm in command!

17:22.573 --> 17:25.170
Don't shoot! You are not allowed to shoot!

17:26.847 --> 17:28.476
His skin is not the same.

17:44.883 --> 17:47.183
Eren! Eren!

17:47.221 --> 17:48.624
That boy is a precious observation subject!

17:48.625 --> 17:50.184
Rescue him! - Yes!

17:58.210 --> 17:59.508
He defends himself!

17:59.846 --> 18:01.315
The one is also conscious!

18:01.583 --> 18:04.646
Wait, all of you wait!

18:19.819 --> 18:20.878
It's useless!

19:07.846 --> 19:14.315
"Attack on Titan"

19:32.361 --> 19:33.624
Mr. Souda...

19:34.732 --> 19:35.962
in the end what were you trying to say?

19:42.013 --> 19:44.718
We now will go to Monzen

19:44.719 --> 19:45.584
take back the dud bomb and

19:45.721 --> 19:47.850
fill up the hole in the external wall.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.796
Let's go. -Yes.

19:53.403 --> 19:55.999
You really want to fix that hole?

19:58.379 --> 20:00.611
In addition to being almost wiped out

20:00.784 --> 20:02.616
where are we going to get explosives?

20:03.589 --> 20:05.025
Didn't you listen before?

20:05.026 --> 20:06.996
There is one in Monzen.

20:07.063 --> 20:08.861
It's there, right? The bomb!

20:10.069 --> 20:12.369
Can you really believe someone like that?

20:12.607 --> 20:14.474
And will people even go up this wall?

20:14.545 --> 20:15.706
I will go.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.351
We have to fix the wall.

20:18.352 --> 20:20.379
We already sacrificed too much and

20:20.557 --> 20:22.025
we can't let those sacrifices be in vain.

20:22.794 --> 20:26.028
That's impossible, I quit.

20:27.938 --> 20:29.497
Then go home!

20:31.845 --> 20:33.575
If you still have a person to go back to,

20:33.883 --> 20:35.819
that isn't between a Titans teeth.

20:46.941 --> 20:47.909
Move!

20:50.482 --> 20:53.921
You will have to drag my legs.

20:54.022 --> 20:55.514
Done.

20:57.095 --> 20:59.862
Hurry up, we have to leave
before the Titans spot us.

21:01.136 --> 21:02.468
Mikasa, what will you do?

21:08.584 --> 21:09.483
Mikasa.

21:10.822 --> 21:12.814
Don't you want to return to Monzen?

21:15.865 --> 21:17.164
Can I go back?

21:18.737 --> 21:20.138
You have to.

21:28.724 --> 21:31.422
Without me, you will certainly all die.

21:32.965 --> 21:35.094
Well, that's right.

21:37.709 --> 21:38.743
Who's left now...?

21:38.744 --> 21:40.646
That Titan's good friend

21:40.647 --> 21:42.139
will not return home?

21:42.217 --> 21:44.619
Eren was never an ally of Titans.

21:45.790 --> 21:48.819
Then why didn't the Titan eat him?

21:49.998 --> 21:51.092
That's...

24:03.962 --> 24:06.832
Why do the birds still sing?

24:09.774 --> 24:12.006
Clearly it's the end of the world.

24:15.251 --> 24:16.811
Captain...

24:25.671 --> 24:27.732
That song is meaningless.

24:29.212 --> 24:31.114
Why do you think the birds have to sing it?

24:35.191 --> 24:36.887
Because they know

24:38.063 --> 24:40.830
that the walls are not
the end of the world.

24:47.281 --> 24:48.841
What is this place?

25:01.642 --> 25:04.705
I followed the Titan that caught you

25:06.185 --> 25:08.120
and then I saved you.

25:13.900 --> 25:16.166
The Titan escaped.

25:21.949 --> 25:23.748
Thank you.

25:26.792 --> 25:27.919
Look...

25:28.963 --> 25:32.060
this is the way this world works.

25:56.985 --> 25:58.385
It's shocking...

26:00.124 --> 26:02.994
Titans are the true face of humanity.

26:04.066 --> 26:07.129
Titans are... human...?

26:08.040 --> 26:10.408
They were created by humans,

26:13.251 --> 26:15.687
they did not evolve,

26:16.089 --> 26:18.218
they were meant as a weapon.

26:20.097 --> 26:24.903
However a hundred years ago,
somehow they got out of control

26:25.374 --> 26:27.845
their numbers exploded.

26:30.317 --> 26:33.414
Many humans have turned into Titans.

26:42.041 --> 26:44.409
Nobody knew who may turn.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.712
Can you guess what happened next?

26:49.789 --> 26:53.091
Mankind began to mistrust
each other, kill each other

26:53.463 --> 26:55.159
and then to self-destruct.

27:00.242 --> 27:05.116
This used to be a big city.

27:16.006 --> 27:19.776
The people trapped inside these
walls never changed into Titans,

27:20.148 --> 27:22.779
later a small number of rulers emerged

27:23.221 --> 27:25.419
and governed the majority.

27:25.860 --> 27:29.162
In this way, a better world was born.

27:31.738 --> 27:32.831
Here?

27:34.911 --> 27:38.042
There are several rooms like this.

27:39.319 --> 27:42.758
Here the government was
able to monitor people,

27:42.994 --> 27:49.132
to forget and bury the sinful past.

27:53.481 --> 27:54.847
Abandon it...

27:55.852 --> 27:58.322
Abandon something you have to protect
and you will become stronger.

27:59.493 --> 28:01.223
That man told me so.

28:02.866 --> 28:08.173
I have nothing...
not even memories to discard.

28:08.945 --> 28:10.243
I understand...

28:14.188 --> 28:16.784
Now you are the Grim Reaper to Titans.

28:18.430 --> 28:21.994
I have too many things to protect.

28:28.115 --> 28:30.017
10 o'clock in the distance there're Titans!

28:30.353 --> 28:34.259
Eight, nine of them!

28:34.529 --> 28:35.997
They appear to be common Titans!

28:36.098 --> 28:39.127
So normal Titans, that's so boring.

28:43.178 --> 28:45.114
I really don't want to die.

28:45.816 --> 28:47.046
Hey...

28:49.925 --> 28:54.230
Captain Shikishima was only your savior

28:54.968 --> 28:58.874
and teacher... is that it?

29:10.298 --> 29:12.001
Two years ago, the destruction of the wall

29:12.002 --> 29:14.370
was an opportunity for the government.

29:15.141 --> 29:16.838
What happened at that time?

29:21.989 --> 29:24.186
It was just before the investigation
outside the wall began.

29:24.293 --> 29:27.857
Yes! People quickly forget
to fear the Titans.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.366
Loyalty to the government grows weaker.

29:31.307 --> 29:33.607
Even with the control of
intelligence, living space and

29:33.945 --> 29:36.415
the number of children one can have,

29:37.218 --> 29:39.087
humans began to try to go outside the wall.

29:39.088 --> 29:40.887
Then what happened?

29:49.442 --> 29:50.603
The Titan appeared!

29:50.912 --> 29:52.141
Correct.

29:54.352 --> 29:56.254
Everything occurred exactly as planned.

29:58.326 --> 30:02.528
People's resentment turned to the Titans

30:06.041 --> 30:09.572
But there were so many people that died!

30:09.649 --> 30:12.313
Unfortunately, that's how it is now.

30:14.391 --> 30:19.629
How many people must be
sacrificed to repair the walls?

30:21.472 --> 30:25.045
I saw those, who were
swallowed by the Titans,

30:25.046 --> 30:27.175
the horror images were engraved in my mind.

30:31.158 --> 30:35.326
Until when will such a thing continue?

30:36.668 --> 30:40.300
Do you really think the government
wants to repair exterior walls?

30:42.547 --> 30:45.416
Then for what purpose does this

30:46.087 --> 30:47.521
futile mission continue!?

30:47.690 --> 30:49.318
Don't you understand?

30:50.729 --> 30:52.426
You know.

30:55.672 --> 30:58.109
Sacrifice is necessary.

30:59.046 --> 31:00.147
Titans and fear

31:00.148 --> 31:02.311
must be rooted in the hearts
of future generations.

31:03.488 --> 31:06.460
People should no longer dare to have
ideas about going outside the wall.

31:06.561 --> 31:08.497
And to reduce the number of the brave.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.598
This is wrong!

31:14.042 --> 31:17.481
Therefore, let's end it all.

31:23.393 --> 31:25.158
I waited for you a long time.

31:26.199 --> 31:27.224
For me?

31:30.474 --> 31:33.079
You are different from other livestock.

31:33.080 --> 31:35.175
Even if you turn into a Titan,
you still retain consciousness

31:35.751 --> 31:37.380
This is the evolution.

31:38.223 --> 31:40.055
You are a new human being.

31:41.429 --> 31:43.797
You are the chosen man to

31:46.305 --> 31:50.679
end the era of slavery,
to open up a new era.

31:53.185 --> 31:55.748
Don't betray the hero inside you.

32:02.437 --> 32:04.031
Hero?

32:46.324 --> 32:47.622
But...

32:49.229 --> 32:51.426
can you rely on me?

32:52.235 --> 32:53.727
No self-confidence?

32:54.840 --> 32:56.365
Kind of...

32:59.149 --> 33:00.310
Come with me.

33:17.217 --> 33:18.846
Why did you volunteer to join the troops?

33:19.221 --> 33:21.715
People from the inner walls
don't need to join the corps.

33:24.231 --> 33:26.258
You can have a "Titan"
within the inner walls,

33:28.807 --> 33:30.537
with huge attitude,

33:31.178 --> 33:33.181
no matter what I said he always opposed,

33:33.182 --> 33:34.707
my crappy dad.

33:37.691 --> 33:39.684
At least you have a father.

33:39.895 --> 33:41.694
It isn't good at all.

33:44.438 --> 33:46.499
Better than nothing. - It isn't!

33:47.143 --> 33:48.635
This can be useful, right?

33:58.633 --> 33:59.658
Hey!

34:07.283 --> 34:08.409
That's...

34:08.585 --> 34:10.179
...the dud bomb.

34:13.594 --> 34:14.755
It's home.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.317
Be cautious,

34:29.391 --> 34:31.659
we will now enter Titans territory.

34:40.949 --> 34:41.938
Everyone!

34:47.228 --> 34:49.460
They are like-minded partners.

34:49.799 --> 34:51.268
Scout Corps...

34:52.272 --> 34:53.739
They haven't been wiped out...

34:55.411 --> 34:57.574
You shouldn't believe in
everything that people tell you.

34:59.686 --> 35:01.689
I just put that false information

35:01.690 --> 35:03.683
in order to keep the explosives.

35:21.662 --> 35:22.687
How is the movement of Titans?

35:22.898 --> 35:25.495
There are four in the far east.

35:26.639 --> 35:28.370
That is no problem.

35:31.782 --> 35:33.216
I have never seen such weapons before...

35:33.385 --> 35:35.378
Those are guns from time
before the Titan-War.

35:35.522 --> 35:37.583
The government kept them secret.

35:37.894 --> 35:41.731
Of course they are useless against Titans,
but very effective against people.

35:43.672 --> 35:46.872
This gun was prepared by the government
to be used against humanity.

35:57.266 --> 35:58.859
We are not livestock!

35:59.804 --> 36:04.211
Yes, you are your own masters.

36:16.370 --> 36:17.736
I miss it...

36:19.676 --> 36:21.646
the town where you were born in.

36:50.470 --> 36:51.665
By the way

36:53.343 --> 36:55.336
I heard that there are
still some explosives.

37:01.792 --> 37:03.819
Are you ready? I will throw the net.

37:09.742 --> 37:11.370
Everything's fine on this side.

37:11.478 --> 37:12.708
I tied it up.

37:14.852 --> 37:16.320
I'm ready, let us leave.

37:16.454 --> 37:18.321
This side looks good too.

37:18.425 --> 37:20.327
I must do something with that one.

37:20.462 --> 37:21.657
Jean, hurry up.

37:21.765 --> 37:23.860
Shut up, I know it.

37:26.041 --> 37:28.010
Good, I'm done.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.005
This one? -Make it a little tighter.

37:31.318 --> 37:34.484
I know! But will it hold?

37:36.795 --> 37:39.357
Come on, let's move before
the Titans find us.

37:39.968 --> 37:42.097
But how will we get it up the wall?

37:42.405 --> 37:44.375
We will all have to pull together.

37:46.513 --> 37:48.039
If only we could attach it to Eren.

37:48.384 --> 37:49.944
Even if he was there, so what?

37:50.722 --> 37:53.125
Would he listen to us, humans?

38:12.331 --> 38:13.424
For you.

38:36.813 --> 38:37.838
The front is okay.

38:37.948 --> 38:40.647
We have to figure it out how
to detonate the explosives.

38:40.721 --> 38:43.591
After we arrive at the outer wall
we will take this bomb and...

40:01.646 --> 40:02.773
Hey!

40:19.715 --> 40:24.053
A gun from before the war?
Just let me see it!

40:24.124 --> 40:28.623
MGL, yeah! What is this?
(Multiple Grenade Launcher)

40:28.767 --> 40:29.826
Mikasa!

40:30.971 --> 40:32.030
Eren!

40:33.977 --> 40:35.639
Eren! - Eren!

40:39.989 --> 40:41.116
I'm sorry I made you worry.

40:46.768 --> 40:48.328
The captain saved me.

40:55.318 --> 40:59.156
You saved us a lot of
trouble digging it up.

41:06.808 --> 41:08.971
Captain, who are these children?

41:09.847 --> 41:12.250
Hope for the future, right?

41:13.855 --> 41:17.124
Yes, Captain.
One more thing, what is this box?

41:17.262 --> 41:18.855
Air missiles.

41:19.032 --> 41:20.000
I knew it!

41:20.167 --> 41:21.569
Before the Titan war we had equipment

41:21.570 --> 41:24.667
that could easily hit a moving target.

41:24.910 --> 41:26.011
Not only that, but it will

41:26.012 --> 41:29.007
also guide us to victory!

41:29.653 --> 41:31.019
Take a look, enjoy it!

41:31.156 --> 41:35.723
Fantastic! This is not the RDS!

41:40.174 --> 41:41.164
Everybody!

41:41.911 --> 41:43.174
The time has come

41:44.882 --> 41:47.319
to take this large bomb!

41:49.659 --> 41:52.790
We will now rise up and
overthrow the government!

41:53.199 --> 41:56.661
We have the power to change this world!

41:56.806 --> 41:58.331
We will go to the inner wall!

41:58.810 --> 41:59.937
Inner wall?

42:01.916 --> 42:04.615
We will blow up the walls there!

42:05.958 --> 42:07.153
What's with what...

42:07.695 --> 42:08.890
The innermost wall.

42:08.997 --> 42:11.661
But the Titans will flood the city.

42:11.768 --> 42:14.969
It will be like a tsunami,
and that's the purpose!

42:15.376 --> 42:19.749
With our equipment and
the bomb you excavated

42:19.818 --> 42:23.781
we will destroy two walls, and the
Titans will spread to the center.

42:24.628 --> 42:26.655
We will defeat the current
system with one strike!

42:27.099 --> 42:29.331
The people from between the
walls will join us and

42:30.673 --> 42:34.009
after we destroy both walls,

42:34.079 --> 42:36.676
a new era of reformed humanity will begin!

42:39.858 --> 42:42.853
How about it? It doesn't sound bad, right?

42:43.832 --> 42:46.234
Eren has already joined us.

42:47.974 --> 42:50.240
Wait a minute, I didn't heard any of it!

42:51.113 --> 42:54.984
With the explosives we're
supposed to fix that hole.

42:59.964 --> 43:02.366
What? Are you so clueless?

43:03.203 --> 43:06.266
You hate those extremely selfish pigs.

43:07.879 --> 43:11.944
But there are also ordinary
people that did nothing wrong.

43:12.021 --> 43:14.082
Yes, because they didn't do anything

43:14.359 --> 43:17.297
others lived a hundred years as livestock.

43:17.365 --> 43:20.826
Contributing to an evil regime
isn't a sufficient crime?

43:21.373 --> 43:24.834
They will never change!

43:27.117 --> 43:31.114
Even so, people don't deserve to die.

43:33.229 --> 43:34.858
Beautiful words...

43:37.237 --> 43:39.070
Are you hearing yourself?

43:48.025 --> 43:50.862
Your hands are already dirty,

43:50.863 --> 43:52.765
didn't you kill a lot of Titans?

43:54.938 --> 43:58.035
Then are also guilty of murdering
ordinary human beings.

44:03.989 --> 44:06.688
Ladies and gentlemen, are
you happy in this world?

44:08.131 --> 44:10.762
You don't know freedom,
the freedom to live!

44:10.870 --> 44:12.304
You don't live free!

44:13.208 --> 44:15.702
Now is the time to stand
up to these inequalities

44:16.013 --> 44:17.812
with us!

44:18.819 --> 44:19.809
What?

44:20.255 --> 44:22.122
The Titians aren't our enemy,

44:22.860 --> 44:25.730
it's the government that
controls us with fear!

44:26.200 --> 44:28.966
Let us use the explosives and
end our lives as livestock!

44:29.306 --> 44:31.435
Now is the time to decide!

44:40.060 --> 44:41.323
Like I said

44:43.300 --> 44:46.329
nothing can be obtained unless
you abandon something else.

44:48.812 --> 44:50.075
I...

44:51.249 --> 44:52.478
The world is cruel.

44:52.785 --> 44:55.086
Eren is the last hope of mankind.

44:55.157 --> 44:57.184
Would you be my daughter's father?

44:57.261 --> 44:59.231
He left his girlfriend in front
of the Titans and ran away.

44:59.332 --> 45:00.900
If we could find a new land

45:00.901 --> 45:02.234
where we will be able to live freely.

45:02.305 --> 45:03.372
Are you human?

45:03.373 --> 45:04.308
Brother!

45:04.309 --> 45:05.777
Help us!

45:06.078 --> 45:07.314
That child was eaten...

45:07.315 --> 45:08.449
they tried to save only themselves.

45:08.450 --> 45:09.850
Please, take care of him.

45:10.220 --> 45:12.453
Eren...

45:25.116 --> 45:26.345
I will not abandon anything.

45:28.289 --> 45:32.457
I don't want to lose anyone again!

45:33.065 --> 45:34.226
What are you talking about?

45:35.068 --> 45:40.842
I won't let you reach your
target with that bomb.

45:44.488 --> 45:45.854
Never!

45:46.525 --> 45:47.993
How do you want to do it?

45:50.867 --> 45:53.394
I won't turn back!

46:00.485 --> 46:02.546
How is his man any good?

46:03.825 --> 46:06.194
You can't win against me.

46:06.531 --> 46:08.364
You know why?

46:19.857 --> 46:22.453
Because you can only complain.

46:23.297 --> 46:24.933
It's the walls fault, the era's fault

46:24.934 --> 46:26.197
the world's fault!

46:35.955 --> 46:38.016
You have so many excuses.

46:41.867 --> 46:43.336
Another laughable person!

46:47.177 --> 46:49.410
You don't have the heart to become a Titan.

47:02.909 --> 47:04.902
You really think you can
become a secret weapon.

47:05.146 --> 47:06.205
It's unwise.

47:17.169 --> 47:22.043
You don't know anything about me.

47:22.346 --> 47:26.047
I've heard much from you
ex-girlfriend there.

47:26.187 --> 47:28.020
Enough of it.

47:29.494 --> 47:30.655
I see...

47:31.631 --> 47:33.066
...you can't bear it?

47:33.502 --> 47:35.131
He was your first boyfriend.

47:55.278 --> 47:57.145
Ungrateful thing.

48:00.421 --> 48:03.655
Let go of her!

48:04.529 --> 48:06.431
You still don't understand me?

48:07.068 --> 48:09.368
You have nothing left.

48:12.979 --> 48:17.648
Take your dirty hands off, don't touch her!

48:33.453 --> 48:35.218
Can we help him?

48:41.035 --> 48:42.628
For example...

48:46.078 --> 48:48.173
but it's impossible.

49:01.441 --> 49:05.541
I'm tired of playing silly games with you.

49:26.658 --> 49:27.626
Who was it!?

49:28.495 --> 49:31.057
Who throw this?

49:34.206 --> 49:35.367
Don't move!

49:38.581 --> 49:40.312
If I press this button

49:40.418 --> 49:42.513
the bomb will explode!

49:43.124 --> 49:45.617
Don't act rashly, or we
will blow up together.

49:47.232 --> 49:48.495
Everyone, hurry up.

49:52.208 --> 49:53.437
Are you okay?

49:56.550 --> 49:57.677
You are an idiot!

49:58.119 --> 50:00.248
Who would believe such nonsense?

50:00.792 --> 50:03.058
This device is designed to detonate bombs,

50:03.564 --> 50:04.589
I made it!

50:06.169 --> 50:10.610
Right! Well, I give you
permission to do it.

50:10.845 --> 50:12.677
Come on, blow me up!

50:20.163 --> 50:23.602
So, it was a lie.

50:32.488 --> 50:33.717
What are you trying now?

50:36.896 --> 50:37.864
Sannagi!

50:37.865 --> 50:39.493
Armin, go!

50:39.902 --> 50:40.562
But...

50:40.837 --> 50:42.567
Hurry up, go!

51:01.811 --> 51:03.280
He has plenty of brute force.

51:03.649 --> 51:05.208
Stop him!

51:10.663 --> 51:11.858
Sannagi!

51:56.319 --> 51:57.810
That idiot...

51:58.723 --> 52:01.217
what will his brother and sister do now?

52:21.335 --> 52:22.325
Huh?

52:25.343 --> 52:27.836
Well done,

52:28.382 --> 52:30.375
you can work great together.

52:30.653 --> 52:32.213
However this is the end.

52:36.631 --> 52:40.594
This bomb will suffice to destroy the wall.

52:40.740 --> 52:42.607
What will you do alone?

52:43.545 --> 52:44.945
I'll let you know

52:45.950 --> 52:49.514
who is the true chosen one.

52:53.398 --> 52:55.869
To do this

52:59.042 --> 53:00.944
you must dedicate your own heart.

53:14.973 --> 53:16.408
Armin, drive!

53:16.610 --> 53:17.873
Everybody, hold on!

53:47.303 --> 53:48.602
Oh no,

53:50.511 --> 53:53.073
the strongest man is also
the strongest Titan,

53:53.415 --> 53:55.351
this is bad!

53:59.661 --> 54:01.324
You already knew?

54:03.536 --> 54:04.765
But I didn't expect...

54:08.345 --> 54:09.438
I'll deal with him!

54:10.316 --> 54:11.841
You take care of the outer wall!

54:14.925 --> 54:19.458
Stop it! Can you really become a Titan?

54:19.634 --> 54:21.296
I have no idea, got to try!

54:21.405 --> 54:23.807
You are not alone, you have
people around you now!

54:24.844 --> 54:26.677
As long as we will keep fighting together,

54:27.650 --> 54:29.448
we can't lose!

54:30.756 --> 54:32.749
We against him!

54:41.777 --> 54:42.972
That's...

54:49.125 --> 54:51.688
We will always be together.

55:05.691 --> 55:06.921
The Titans are gathering!

55:17.615 --> 55:18.605
There he comes!

55:46.939 --> 55:48.704
As expected, he's powerful.

55:51.548 --> 55:54.152
No matter how strong he
is, he has only two hands

55:54.153 --> 55:55.713
and two eyes, so target his weak spots!

55:55.857 --> 55:57.554
Everyone attack!

55:59.196 --> 56:00.688
Let's go!

56:21.941 --> 56:23.034
Mikasa!

56:30.892 --> 56:32.691
He has a blind spot on the left.

56:50.231 --> 56:52.463
I will finish him!

56:54.973 --> 56:56.704
Got you!

57:01.653 --> 57:03.178
Out of the way!

57:06.763 --> 57:07.594
Eren!

57:09.602 --> 57:10.661
Eren!

57:11.840 --> 57:13.433
For my sake...

57:42.199 --> 57:45.660
You will lose!

57:47.543 --> 57:48.876
It' a shame,

57:48.946 --> 57:51.883
I wanted to save the world with you.

58:34.068 --> 58:35.161
Eren!

58:53.673 --> 58:55.142
Did he lose?

58:58.149 --> 59:01.053
Never forget to deal a fatal
blow to the opponent.

59:37.993 --> 59:38.961
Too slow.

59:41.334 --> 59:42.700
You are too slow.

59:44.640 --> 59:45.334
That's it.

59:45.776 --> 59:47.301
Go, Eren!

01:00:10.324 --> 01:00:12.020
He has done it.

01:00:42.053 --> 01:00:44.023
You do remember the bomb, right?

01:00:44.358 --> 01:00:48.423
Stuff it into the cracks on top of the wall

01:00:51.037 --> 01:00:54.271
Does he understand what we're saying?

01:00:57.149 --> 01:01:00.519
That's too loud for us, dumbass!

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:05.961
We will use a timer to blow up
the bomb, that way it's safer.

01:01:07.169 --> 01:01:09.196
But be careful, don't use to much force.

01:01:11.911 --> 01:01:14.280
Okay, let's go.

01:02:00.106 --> 01:02:01.871
He seems very tired.

01:02:20.213 --> 01:02:23.310
Put it into the cracks, there.

01:02:34.107 --> 01:02:35.097
Eren?

01:02:57.386 --> 01:02:59.082
After coming all the way here.

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:00.549
Wake him up!

01:03:00.993 --> 01:03:01.860
How?

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.489
Cut his neck, but don't hurt Eren.

01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:05.091
Mikasa only you can do it!

01:03:25.508 --> 01:03:27.101
Don't cut in the middle!

01:03:38.133 --> 01:03:39.158
Mikasa!

01:03:46.884 --> 01:03:48.182
I'm saved.

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:55.597
As I thought, our pre-war military
vehicles are very reliable.

01:05:05.204 --> 01:05:06.331
Eren.

01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:08.907
Eren.

01:05:14.623 --> 01:05:15.648
Eren.

01:05:17.328 --> 01:05:18.421
Wake up!

01:05:29.051 --> 01:05:30.314
You promised me...

01:05:32.123 --> 01:05:33.956
Didn't you promise?

01:05:34.562 --> 01:05:35.530
The ocean.

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:39.998
The bird should have seen the ocean, right?

01:05:40.139 --> 01:05:41.266
Do you want to see it?

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:36.071
Don't worry, Armin is
taking care of the rest.

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:42.323
Sasha, can you help me hold down there?

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.593
So?

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:49.441
Now I have to mount this. Good.

01:06:49.442 --> 01:06:51.139
It will explode after five minutes.

01:06:52.081 --> 01:06:53.140
Let us leave.

01:06:58.627 --> 01:06:59.686
Are you okay?

01:07:14.325 --> 01:07:17.023
You worked so hard to reach this place.

01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:20.502
I didnât thought you had it in you.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:25.143
You are heroes who fixed the wall.

01:07:25.246 --> 01:07:27.616
You can live for the rest of your
lives within the inner walls,

01:07:27.617 --> 01:07:30.214
enjoying aristocratic benefits.

01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:34.291
But first you must hand
over your Titan friend,

01:07:34.598 --> 01:07:40.099
and promise to continue to guard the walls.

01:07:43.282 --> 01:07:44.375
We refuse!

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:49.554
We're not going to betray
Eren for something like that!

01:08:00.448 --> 01:08:01.815
Armin! - Armin!

01:08:10.535 --> 01:08:12.368
Idiots!

01:08:13.608 --> 01:08:16.645
What are you hoping for in life?

01:08:16.647 --> 01:08:20.176
We want to know the truth about this world!

01:08:20.254 --> 01:08:21.654
And what will you do with that knowledge?

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.529
People simply can't handle the truth.

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:31.710
Staying obediently behind the
wall, without knowing anything,

01:08:31.711 --> 01:08:33.703
that way you will be the most happiest.

01:08:34.482 --> 01:08:37.682
Therefore we should guard the wall!

01:08:38.457 --> 01:08:41.327
Walls are necessary!

01:08:42.365 --> 01:08:46.362
Outside the wall you will find hell!

01:08:46.805 --> 01:08:49.243
Instead of the slavery in heaven,

01:08:50.481 --> 01:08:52.609
I choose the freedom in hell!

01:08:52.785 --> 01:08:53.912
Is that alright?

01:08:54.321 --> 01:08:56.724
Outside you will only find helplessness,

01:08:57.193 --> 01:08:58.526
at least inside the walls...

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:06.403
Sasha

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.575
Sasha... it's dangerous!

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:44.215
It's a lie, right...?

01:09:44.653 --> 01:09:46.316
The commander is also a Titan.

01:09:47.326 --> 01:09:50.457
They want to rule us using fear.

01:09:55.909 --> 01:09:58.437
He prevented us from repairing the wall.

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:02.850
Give me a three-dimensional maneuvering
equipment with gas canisters.

01:10:16.783 --> 01:10:18.480
I've been waiting for this day.

01:10:27.672 --> 01:10:30.006
Damn, he's burning.

01:10:32.648 --> 01:10:34.014
Hold on!

01:10:36.556 --> 01:10:37.854
Don't be afraid.

01:10:55.025 --> 01:10:56.517
Come on, Eren!

01:10:58.933 --> 01:11:01.598
Don't touch the bomb!

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:06.342
Jean!

01:11:10.757 --> 01:11:13.387
Go to hell!

01:11:17.336 --> 01:11:18.736
Armin, get up!

01:11:33.735 --> 01:11:34.862
Eren, no!

01:11:52.572 --> 01:11:54.633
They actually had such kind of a thing!

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:31.910
It's almost time!

01:12:46.746 --> 01:12:48.807
Eren, run away!

01:12:52.156 --> 01:12:53.590
You'll die!

01:12:55.696 --> 01:12:57.461
Donât be silly!

01:12:59.003 --> 01:13:00.835
For Jean

01:13:01.741 --> 01:13:04.713
and for everyone I will take revenge!

01:13:07.051 --> 01:13:08.782
But the bomb will explode anytime now...

01:13:11.895 --> 01:13:13.022
It's time.

01:13:31.433 --> 01:13:32.594
Hey!

01:13:47.999 --> 01:13:49.467
It didn't explode.

01:13:49.569 --> 01:13:51.037
What went wrong?

01:14:02.628 --> 01:14:03.960
I will go.

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.432
Mikasa!

01:14:09.842 --> 01:14:11.903
Could you target the bomb with this weapon?

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:16.010
If you can hit the fuse, it will detonate.

01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:17.556
There we go...

01:14:17.658 --> 01:14:18.717
Wait!

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.559
Mikasa!

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:40.667
What now?

01:14:41.705 --> 01:14:43.265
What a shame

01:14:49.119 --> 01:14:51.021
they can hit the fuse

01:14:51.691 --> 01:14:53.854
but you will be blown to pieces.

01:15:07.689 --> 01:15:08.918
Please,

01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:10.727
don't take it away.

01:15:11.497 --> 01:15:13.900
It's useless, no matter how many
times the wall will be damaged

01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:15.996
they still will rebuilt it.

01:15:17.942 --> 01:15:20.539
Just to save themselves, it's pathetic.

01:15:25.992 --> 01:15:27.689
How about you...

01:15:36.546 --> 01:15:38.106
How about your walls?

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.941
Take that!

01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:59.174
I admire your tenacity

01:16:59.242 --> 01:17:01.770
but that's my prey!

01:17:08.193 --> 01:17:10.060
You have your good years ahead of you.

01:17:12.869 --> 01:17:13.801
Eren...

01:17:35.346 --> 01:17:37.111
The commander has been wiped out...

01:17:37.651 --> 01:17:38.778
How about the wall?

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:41.090
Don't worry! The first explosion vaporized

01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:43.761
halogen, boron, aluminum, silicon, etc.

01:17:43.762 --> 01:17:45.858
soon there will be a second explosion.

01:17:47.103 --> 01:17:48.799
Look, here!

01:18:04.771 --> 01:18:06.171
Amazing!

01:19:11.134 --> 01:19:12.397
Are you okay?

01:19:26.064 --> 01:19:27.293
The hole...

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.768
was filled up.

01:19:28.903 --> 01:19:30.429
Great!

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:37.209
Look

01:20:57.945 --> 01:20:59.379
Everything begins now.

01:21:42.599 --> 01:21:45.594
Attack on Titan 2: The end of the world

01:26:48.601 --> 01:26:51.471
I'm surprised,

01:26:52.777 --> 01:26:57.844
it seems that the two escaped
the experimental area.

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:05.223
I didn't expect it. Really interesting.
