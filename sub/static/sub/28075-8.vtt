00:01.625 --> 00:02.718
Cary, lean in.

00:02.765 --> 00:04.526
Brooky, hold Chasey so he doesn't fall.

00:04.595 --> 00:06.027
Now, let's get that bottle out of there.

00:06.096 --> 00:07.730
We don't want that bottle in the photo.

00:07.798 --> 00:09.937
Okay, say cheese.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.367
Aw, hell yeah, you guys are killing it.

00:12.435 --> 00:13.735
That is so fucking hot.

00:13.804 --> 00:15.114
And, uh, let's get that bottle in there.

00:15.169 --> 00:17.213
Need that bottle in the photo.

00:17.265 --> 00:19.848
- Okay, say Voss.
- Voss.

00:19.965 --> 00:22.911
Okay, great, and now one
with just my two stars,

00:22.980 --> 00:24.412
Brooky and Cary.

00:24.481 --> 00:25.981
Okay, great, and now one

00:26.049 --> 00:28.383
with just my two stars,
Chase and the water.

00:28.451 --> 00:29.683
Oh, that's perfect.

00:29.752 --> 00:31.151
This is going right in a frame.

00:31.220 --> 00:34.087
Can we get the other two out of frame?

00:34.156 --> 00:36.390
A little further.

00:36.458 --> 00:39.292

Can you believe that
this is a birthday party

00:49.371 --> 00:51.171
for a 14-year-old?

00:51.240 --> 00:54.307
I know, my 14th birthday
party was gumball-themed.

00:54.376 --> 00:56.644
We just, like, ate different gums.

00:56.712 --> 00:58.145
This is way better.

00:58.213 --> 01:00.380
That actually sounds so nice right now.

01:00.449 --> 01:02.982
Oh, did I tell you that
that Jeremy guy's coming?

01:03.052 --> 01:05.084
Wait, the drama teacher from Jersey?

01:05.154 --> 01:06.520
Yeah, he's in the city.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.655
I spent, like, literally
all day preparing.

01:08.723 --> 01:10.490
- Your butt?
- Yeah.

01:10.559 --> 01:12.259
I haven't eaten in 12 hours.

01:12.327 --> 01:13.760
I'm fucking starving.

01:13.828 --> 01:15.128
Can you promise he's gay?

01:15.197 --> 01:17.030
This isn't another roommate situation.

01:17.099 --> 01:19.166
Yeah, no, he's... he's definitely gay,

01:19.234 --> 01:20.900
and I'm really excited
about this because, like,

01:20.969 --> 01:23.470
when we first met, I was
all depressed about my career,

01:23.539 --> 01:26.139
but now I'm... I'm
definitely gaining traction.

01:26.208 --> 01:28.575
Well, your bouffant
is certainly blonder.

01:28.643 --> 01:30.625
- Tionna, wait.
- I am waiting.

01:30.695 --> 01:32.645
You're not waiting, you're walking.

01:32.714 --> 01:34.914
Oh, my God, who are all of these people?

01:34.983 --> 01:37.483
I gave Streeter the smallest guest list.

01:37.552 --> 01:38.718
I gotta go find him.

All right, I'm gonna go, uh...

01:49.230 --> 01:50.863
What is that? Where did you get that?

01:50.932 --> 01:52.131
They just had it over here for me.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.466
No, give me that.

01:53.534 --> 01:55.301
Give it. Absolutely not.

01:55.369 --> 01:58.037
You're not drinking alcohol tonight.
You're 14.

01:58.106 --> 02:01.307

obligated to drink Voss.

and Brooky to be mad.

02:15.623 --> 02:18.289
Why... why would we be mad?
It's a party.

02:18.358 --> 02:19.591
Okay, good. I took Molly.

02:19.660 --> 02:21.226
- What?
- Mona gave it to me.

02:21.294 --> 02:22.527
Hi, I'm Mona.

02:22.596 --> 02:24.329
- Hi.
- I effing love your mom.

02:24.397 --> 02:26.564
Mona said that I deserved it
because I've worked really hard

02:26.634 --> 02:29.001
and I've raised three children
and I deserve it.

02:29.069 --> 02:31.569
Well, you're still raising one.

02:31.638 --> 02:34.338
Don't worry 'cause, it
was, like, a super small dose

02:34.406 --> 02:37.207
and she can handle it 'cause
this lady's a rock star.

02:37.276 --> 02:39.710
Mona, I want to go over there.

02:50.690 --> 02:52.389
Parties aren't about friends, Brooke.

02:52.458 --> 02:53.624
They're about making sure

02:53.693 --> 02:55.392
strangers know that you had one,

02:55.461 --> 02:58.929
and that's why I invited all of
New York's hottest daughters.

the chip heiress,

03:01.934 --> 03:04.534

but I can't hang out, okay?

03:53.544 --> 03:54.843

05:28.503 --> 05:31.404
Oh, no, I went on
"Watch What Happens Live."

05:31.473 --> 05:33.006
- You did?
- Yeah.

05:33.075 --> 05:36.243

05:45.854 --> 05:48.255

05:48.323 --> 05:49.522
Or with Esther Lay.

05:49.591 --> 05:50.690
I just met her.

05:50.759 --> 05:52.392
She's really, really nice.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.761
I mean, it's weird that
she's here, but, you know,

05:54.829 --> 05:57.129
it's helpful to know people like that.

05:57.198 --> 05:58.698
Why, is she a director?

05:58.767 --> 06:00.633
No, she's a chip heiress.

06:00.702 --> 06:02.368
Oh.

06:08.476 --> 06:09.776

06:09.844 --> 06:12.912
Hey, go around. Just go around me!

06:12.980 --> 06:15.748
Can't believe I'm in line for
a party that I planned.

06:15.817 --> 06:17.016
I know what could cheer you up.

06:17.084 --> 06:18.818
Check out my new shoes.

06:18.887 --> 06:21.421
They're dry-erase, so you can
make 'em any kind you want:

06:21.489 --> 06:23.756
Nike, Adidas, red.

06:23.825 --> 06:26.325
Right now, they say,
"Happy birthday, Chase."

06:26.394 --> 06:29.261
Actually, they say "Hap irthda, Cha."

06:29.330 --> 06:31.663
I ran here.

06:31.732 --> 06:35.134
Yeah, someone named
@CaryDreamsFeet started

06:35.202 --> 06:40.139
following me, which is so weird
because my feet are fine.

06:40.207 --> 06:42.174
You should get the foot filter app.

06:42.243 --> 06:45.644
Yeah, it really smooths out
your feet and toes for pics.

06:45.712 --> 06:47.512
Oh, that's a good idea.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.214
I'm Jeremy, by the way.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.317
Oh, sorry, that's Jeremy.

06:51.385 --> 06:54.153
Hi, you're Jeremy?

06:54.221 --> 06:55.273
Yes.

06:55.343 --> 06:57.062
- Are you really gay?
- Yes.

06:58.559 --> 07:01.860
Cary, this is so good.

07:01.929 --> 07:03.962
Thanks, Mom.

07:04.030 --> 07:05.697
Mona, I wanna go over there.

07:05.766 --> 07:07.265
Okay.

07:07.334 --> 07:09.534
I love gay guys.

07:11.037 --> 07:13.572
So you been DVRing "RHONY"?

07:13.640 --> 07:15.273
No, Lance, I'm a businesswoman now,

07:15.342 --> 07:17.609
so I don't have time for
"Real Housewives of New York."

07:17.678 --> 07:19.277
That's why I DVR.

07:19.346 --> 07:20.679
Okay, two more.

07:20.747 --> 07:23.247
Oh, thank God. I have to pee so bad.

07:23.316 --> 07:24.816
Oh, ow.

07:24.885 --> 07:26.317
Remember to send Chasey down.

07:26.386 --> 07:28.787
I don't want him to forget
about me tonight.

07:28.856 --> 07:30.921
Or whatever.

07:30.991 --> 07:33.591
Why is the women's line so long?

07:33.659 --> 07:35.226
It's like, use the men's.

07:35.295 --> 07:36.794
That's what it's for.

07:36.863 --> 07:39.897
See, totally empty.

07:41.109 --> 07:43.676
- Oh, Chase.
- Little man.

07:45.818 --> 07:47.841
God, he looks like shit.

07:47.927 --> 07:49.193
Do you think anyone saw him?

07:49.261 --> 07:51.214
No, we took him out the back, B.

07:51.275 --> 07:53.408
No one will ever even know he left.

07:54.846 --> 07:57.167
Any minute now.

07:57.236 --> 07:59.169
This is ridiculous.

07:59.238 --> 08:02.572
I was downstairs for 30 minutes
and he got this wasted?

08:02.641 --> 08:04.407
You know, sometimes
I feel like I'm the only one

08:04.432 --> 08:05.452
that's looking out for him.

08:05.477 --> 08:06.777
What about Care?

08:06.846 --> 08:08.144
I mean, yeah, he's great,

08:08.213 --> 08:11.280
he's just... he's a little
orange right now.

08:11.305 --> 08:12.291
You mean like tan?

08:12.316 --> 08:14.851
No, like orange inside.

08:16.487 --> 08:18.755
I think he's just
going through something.

08:18.823 --> 08:20.356
He's not the only one.

08:20.424 --> 08:21.657
I didn't see my mom once tonight.

08:21.726 --> 08:23.359
Like, where the fuck was she?

08:25.797 --> 08:28.631
Girl, you are loving these nuts.

08:28.699 --> 08:31.768
You mom is my friggin'
spirit animal right now.

08:31.836 --> 08:33.602
Very cool, Mona.

08:33.671 --> 08:36.239
Wait, I have to tell you
what happened this week.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.908
I joined a gym, as you can see,

08:38.977 --> 08:41.409
and my first morning on the treadmill,

08:41.479 --> 08:43.804
one of my students got on next to me.

08:43.851 --> 08:45.247
- No.
- Yes.

08:45.315 --> 08:46.514
I was too embarrassed
to let him see me run,

08:46.583 --> 08:48.283
so I hid in the locker room

08:48.351 --> 08:50.451
and watched clips of dogs
feeling guilty on my phone.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.420
The same thing just happened to me.

08:52.489 --> 08:53.755
I had to start working out

08:53.824 --> 08:56.557
'cause I was on
"Watch What Happens Live."

08:56.626 --> 08:57.826
Yeah, you mentioned that.

08:57.895 --> 08:59.327
Yeah, I mean, like, it was stupid,

08:59.396 --> 09:02.597
but, you know, some people
said I was good on it.

09:02.666 --> 09:05.167
Well, I can't wait to watch it.

09:05.235 --> 09:07.468
Oh, I could pull it up right now.

09:07.537 --> 09:09.905
- Oh, um...
- Just... yeah, I mean, just...

09:09.973 --> 09:12.140
Just... yeah, okay, here we go.

09:12.209 --> 09:14.776
It's still loading.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.278
Still loading.

09:16.346 --> 09:17.745
I think it's taking a long time

09:17.814 --> 09:20.481
'cause I'm downloading
that foot filter app.

09:20.550 --> 09:22.983
I can't believe Chase's
first time getting drunk

09:23.052 --> 09:24.752
was in a club.

09:24.821 --> 09:26.821
I just wanted him to have
a typical teenage experience,

09:26.889 --> 09:29.256
- like mine.
- What was yours?

09:29.326 --> 09:31.326
I got wasted on a thing
of peach schnapps under my bed

09:31.394 --> 09:33.861
and my mom found the bottle
and grounded me

09:33.930 --> 09:36.331
and then I told her
I wished she was dead

09:36.399 --> 09:37.765
and we didn't talk for a month.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.900
Chase'll never get that.

09:39.969 --> 09:41.569
What, don't worry, cook Brooke,

09:41.638 --> 09:43.070
he'll have plenty of firsts.

09:43.139 --> 09:45.306
Maybe he'll lose his V-card
the way you did.

09:45.375 --> 09:46.741
To the drummer from Snow Patrol?

09:46.810 --> 09:48.209
Ew, Lance.

09:48.277 --> 09:50.462
Ew, Chase.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.313
Out, everybody out.

09:53.382 --> 09:56.416
No, sir, we're about
to get on the bridge.

09:56.485 --> 09:58.151
I don't care. Out!

09:58.220 --> 10:00.153
All right, it should
load better out here.

10:00.222 --> 10:02.489
Surpri... oh, God damn it.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.491
- Streeter?
- God damn it.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.226
Did you get Chase a car?

10:06.294 --> 10:08.294
Yes, I got him a car,
and it's a great deal too.

10:08.364 --> 10:11.197
He only has to say Chevy Camaro
in his next three songs.

10:11.266 --> 10:13.132
- Uber for Jordan?
- Uh, what?

10:13.201 --> 10:14.368
Uber for Jordan. I'm Jordan.

10:14.436 --> 10:16.035
This isn't an Uber.

10:16.104 --> 10:17.537
Sorry, I don't like it
when the drivers talk to me.

10:17.606 --> 10:20.073
Yeah, this is good. You're cute.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.174
Yeah, thanks.

10:21.243 --> 10:23.042
Should we go back inside?

10:23.111 --> 10:25.778
Oh, no, was it... was it weird
that I made you watch that?

10:25.847 --> 10:27.580
Yes.

10:27.648 --> 10:30.015
Okay, uh, well,
we want to go back inside.

10:30.084 --> 10:31.083
CaryDreams.

10:31.151 --> 10:33.051
You're not on the list.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.354
Try gay brother.

10:35.423 --> 10:36.689
That's crazy.

10:36.758 --> 10:39.057
Then I dated a guy who was only into me

10:39.126 --> 10:40.959
'cause I was Chase's sister.

10:41.028 --> 10:43.061
He wanted to do it to "Stink."

10:43.130 --> 10:44.864
- Same thing happened to me.
- What?

10:44.932 --> 10:46.465
Yeah, this girl wanted to sleep with me

10:46.534 --> 10:48.834
just 'cause I used to date
Chase's sister.

10:48.903 --> 10:51.537
Ew, how did she even find you?

10:51.606 --> 10:53.572
His fans can find anybody.

10:53.641 --> 10:56.509
Bunch of 'em followed my mom
too and her friend Connie.

10:56.577 --> 10:58.577
- You know Connie.
- Aw, how is Connie?

10:58.646 --> 10:59.945
She's a riot.

11:00.014 --> 11:01.946
Hey, did he puke on my back at all?

11:02.015 --> 11:05.417
Um, oh, barely.

11:05.485 --> 11:07.351
Well, a lot. He puked a lot.

11:07.421 --> 11:08.586
Yeah, I could feel it.

11:09.890 --> 11:12.990
Sorry we couldn't get back in.

11:13.059 --> 11:14.358
It's okay.

11:14.428 --> 11:16.127
I, uh, came here to spend time with you.

11:16.195 --> 11:18.496
I don't care where.

11:18.565 --> 11:21.098
I feel bad I didn't
say good-bye to Esther Lay.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.768
Yeah, I'm sure she's fine.

11:23.837 --> 11:25.336
Yeah.

11:29.275 --> 11:30.575
What's wrong?

11:30.644 --> 11:31.976
Not hungry or?

11:32.045 --> 11:36.814
No, I just wasn't eating in case we...

11:36.882 --> 11:39.483
and I was the, you know.

11:39.552 --> 11:41.685
Oh, yeah, oh, no.

11:41.754 --> 11:46.090
I wasn't gonna eat in case I was the...

11:46.159 --> 11:49.293
Well, one of us
can eat the pizza, right?

11:49.362 --> 11:50.727
Right, yes.

11:50.796 --> 11:52.330
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I mean, um...

11:52.398 --> 11:54.765
I'd prefer to eat the pizza.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.100
Oh, really?

11:56.169 --> 11:57.268
Yeah, but if you want to eat...

11:57.337 --> 11:59.270
No, no, you can eat the pizza.

11:59.339 --> 12:00.804
- Okay, I can, great.
- Uh-huh.

12:00.873 --> 12:03.207
- For tonight.
- Okay, cool.

12:04.844 --> 12:08.679
I feel like I should DM
Esther Lay good-bye

12:08.747 --> 12:11.414
just so she doesn't
think I'm rude, right?

12:11.484 --> 12:12.683
I don't want her mad at me or anything.

12:12.751 --> 12:14.117
Yeah, sure.

12:14.186 --> 12:17.287
Whoo, we're going on a ride now!

12:17.356 --> 12:18.856
Hey, I know him.

12:18.924 --> 12:20.457
Oh, my God, you're high.

12:20.526 --> 12:21.825
That's an Uber driver.

12:21.894 --> 12:23.560
This is not an Uber.

12:23.629 --> 12:25.195
There's a bow on it.

12:25.263 --> 12:27.564
Hey, can we just go back
to your place and have sex?

12:27.633 --> 12:29.967
Oh, now?

12:30.035 --> 12:32.482
- Yes, great, good, yes, okay.
- Yeah, good, uh-huh.

12:32.544 --> 12:33.732
What is happening?

12:33.771 --> 12:34.838
And my roommate actually sucks,

12:34.907 --> 12:36.640
so could we go to my brother's place?

12:36.709 --> 12:39.476
I know that's weird, but
they won't be back for hours.

12:39.545 --> 12:41.511
- O-Okay.
- Great.

12:41.579 --> 12:44.113
- Your brother's place, great.
- Yes.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.681
I love you, Streeter.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.217
And I love Chase.

12:48.285 --> 12:49.619
He's like a father to me.

12:49.687 --> 12:51.020
That's nice.

12:51.088 --> 12:54.223
I know everyone laughs at you,
but not me.

12:54.291 --> 12:55.357
I think you're great.

12:56.009 --> 13:00.396
- Whoo, we're going so fast.
- Whoo!

13:00.464 --> 13:02.765
- Everyone laughs at me?
- Whoo!

13:02.834 --> 13:04.433
Okay, I'm very much starting to get mad.

13:04.502 --> 13:06.168
Can we just go?

13:06.520 --> 13:08.098
You know, mad respect to Justin,

13:08.168 --> 13:09.926
but I do not get "The Leftovers."

13:09.989 --> 13:11.559
I think you just have to keep watching.

13:11.614 --> 13:12.814
Cary says it picks up.

13:12.882 --> 13:13.881
What season are you on?

13:13.951 --> 13:15.450
I just finished the third.

13:15.518 --> 13:17.518
Oh, then you just don't like it.

13:17.587 --> 13:20.121
Damn, but I love to like things.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.690
Aw, I know you do.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.683
You just put him down by the motorcycle.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.060
Think he's gonna puke again.

13:26.102 --> 13:27.197
He should probably be by a toilet.

13:27.222 --> 13:28.847
Yeah, well, the motorcycle is a toilet.

13:28.918 --> 13:31.852
Damn, for real?

13:31.921 --> 13:33.454
I got you, bro.

13:33.522 --> 13:34.624
This place is exactly

13:34.678 --> 13:36.190
what my house is gonna
look like when I'm rich.

13:36.259 --> 13:37.959
Wait, is there a 7UP hot tub?

13:38.010 --> 13:39.319
No.

13:39.374 --> 13:42.063
Okay, it's almost what
my house is gonna look like.

13:50.773 --> 13:52.005
Cary?

13:53.108 --> 13:54.107
What are you doing here?

13:54.176 --> 13:57.678
Oh, um, sex?

13:57.746 --> 14:00.481
Hell yeah, Care.

14:00.549 --> 14:01.882
That's what I'm talking about, Care.

14:01.907 --> 14:02.933
Thank you, Lance.

14:03.003 --> 14:05.819
Okay, well, we're here
because Chase got drunk

14:05.888 --> 14:07.788
and has been puking his guts out.

14:07.857 --> 14:09.050
- He did?
- Yes.

14:09.105 --> 14:10.128
Where was Mom?

14:10.175 --> 14:12.192
You'd think if your husband
was a full-blown alcoholic,

14:12.260 --> 14:14.460
you'd be more protective
of your kid in the club.

14:14.529 --> 14:16.796
What?

14:16.865 --> 14:18.030
Oh, shit.

14:18.099 --> 14:19.398
Nothing. Nothing, buddy.

14:19.423 --> 14:20.443
I was just joking.

14:20.468 --> 14:21.901
Hey, come on, man.

14:21.970 --> 14:23.035
Why don't we get you
back to your motorcycle?

14:23.104 --> 14:24.670
Whoa, I like your shoes.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.005
Thanks, homie.

14:26.073 --> 14:29.642
Hello, I'm home now!

14:29.711 --> 14:31.677
She's home.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.846
Mom, what are you doing here?

14:33.915 --> 14:35.648
I'm riding a horsey.

14:35.717 --> 14:37.449
Shh, it's just Streeter.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.320
It's just me. I'm not a horse.

14:41.389 --> 14:43.155
What are you guys doing?
You laughing at me?

14:43.224 --> 14:44.991
What? No, why?

14:45.059 --> 14:46.959
N-no reason. I was just checking.

14:47.028 --> 14:49.895
Wait, is this Justin Theroux's house?

14:49.963 --> 14:53.264
Why is my night so random?

14:53.333 --> 14:55.834
- Who are you?
- I-Isn't it fancy?

14:55.903 --> 14:58.169
My bedroom is a swimming pool.

14:58.238 --> 14:59.404
This place has a pool?

14:59.472 --> 15:00.772
Are you playing? Come on, man.

15:00.841 --> 15:02.473
The hits just keep coming.

15:02.543 --> 15:04.910
- Lance.
- Mama D.

15:04.978 --> 15:06.110
What is going on with Mom?

15:06.179 --> 15:07.546
Is she drunk too?

15:07.614 --> 15:10.782
No, she's on Molly
because she deserves it?

15:10.851 --> 15:11.883
What?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.686
Welcome to our house.

15:14.755 --> 15:17.221
It's better than our old house

15:17.290 --> 15:19.090
because my husband died there

15:19.159 --> 15:21.926
and that made me very sad.

15:21.994 --> 15:23.694
Mom, are you okay?

15:23.763 --> 15:25.863
But now I'm very happy!

15:25.932 --> 15:28.498
And now I'm very tiny.

15:28.568 --> 15:31.134
And now I have a secret for you.

15:34.106 --> 15:35.272
What did she say?

15:35.340 --> 15:36.707
That she wants to go over there.

15:36.776 --> 15:38.742
Okay.

15:38.811 --> 15:41.478
So why did we stop here?

15:43.382 --> 15:44.715
Mom, what you doing over here?

15:44.784 --> 15:49.386
Oh, my kids, I love you so much.

15:49.455 --> 15:53.156
Just know that I will always
be here to protect all of you.

15:53.225 --> 15:54.725
Oh, really, Mom, all of us?

15:54.794 --> 15:56.182
What do you mean?

15:56.237 --> 15:58.361
Okay, well, you know that
I'm Chase's assistant, right?

15:58.430 --> 16:00.263
- I'm not his mo...
- Brooke, maybe not right now.

16:00.332 --> 16:01.631
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

16:01.700 --> 16:03.533
You, haha, laughing at me?

16:03.602 --> 16:05.168
You know, my shirt
and my hair and all this?

16:05.237 --> 16:06.470
'Cause I'm in on it.

16:06.538 --> 16:08.938
No, we're having a family moment.

16:09.007 --> 16:10.440
I have so many nuts in my purse.

16:10.509 --> 16:12.476
Who put all these nuts in here?

16:12.544 --> 16:15.612
What, you did, you friggin' psycho.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.914
Oh, my God, that lady
is a friggin' psycho,

16:17.983 --> 16:21.151
- but I love her so much.
- Oh, crap.

16:21.220 --> 16:23.253
I gotta go save Chase.

16:23.322 --> 16:25.755
Yeah, and I should walk Lance out.

16:25.824 --> 16:29.658
I got nothing to do.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.327
Hey, sorry, Jeremy,

16:31.395 --> 16:33.496
I don't think now's
the best time for a photo.

16:33.564 --> 16:34.997
What?

16:35.065 --> 16:37.099
I just... he's feeling
kind of sick so...

16:37.168 --> 16:39.101
I wasn't asking for a photo.

16:39.170 --> 16:41.504
He was just bringing me water
'cause you guys were talking.

16:41.572 --> 16:43.972
Oh, sorry, I just...

16:44.041 --> 16:46.609
I knew you wanted a photo
with him for your students.

16:46.677 --> 16:49.845
I mean, I guess... I guess
I could take one with you.

16:49.913 --> 16:51.147
What?

16:51.215 --> 16:52.481
It's just... 'cause, you know,

16:52.550 --> 16:56.018
they might weirdly know who I am

16:56.086 --> 16:59.021
because of...

16:59.089 --> 17:00.289
I actually think I'm gonna go.

17:00.358 --> 17:02.324
What?

17:02.393 --> 17:04.859
I'm just feeling a little tired.

17:04.928 --> 17:06.194
Okay, yeah, no, cool.

17:06.262 --> 17:07.428
Cool, yeah, all right.

17:07.497 --> 17:09.731
I'll walk you out.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.732
Feel better.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.034
Thanks.

17:16.707 --> 17:19.406
Hey, thanks for all your help tonight.

17:19.476 --> 17:21.843
Of course. You know I got you, girl.

17:21.912 --> 17:23.511
Um, and as a thank-you,

17:23.579 --> 17:25.346
you can tell me what's
been happening on "RHONY."

17:25.415 --> 17:27.015
Oh, hell yeah.

17:27.084 --> 17:30.385
Okay, so on the last ep,
they all went to the Catskills

17:30.453 --> 17:32.688
and Ramona fell in the fireplace

17:32.756 --> 17:34.622
and they showed her whole butt.

17:34.692 --> 17:36.869
Whoa. They didn't blur it?

17:36.932 --> 17:39.799
No, I think it's 'cause it
didn't really look like a butt.

17:43.966 --> 17:47.068
Hey, is everything okay?

17:47.136 --> 17:49.870
Yeah, I just...

17:49.939 --> 17:53.908
I'm just not sure if I'm into
this whole new vibe.

17:53.976 --> 17:55.109
What do you mean?

17:55.178 --> 17:57.111
Is this 'cause of the picture thing?

17:57.180 --> 17:58.378
- No.
- 'Cause I...

17:58.447 --> 18:00.915
I just, uh...

18:00.983 --> 18:03.550
I know I don't know you that well,

18:03.619 --> 18:05.786
but it feels like you a month ago

18:05.855 --> 18:09.924
would make fun of you now.

18:09.992 --> 18:13.728
- Oh, yikes.
- I just...

18:13.796 --> 18:15.495
It feels like you don't

18:15.564 --> 18:18.257
really know who you are right now.

18:21.370 --> 18:24.904
Um, okay.

18:24.973 --> 18:28.208
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry?

18:28.277 --> 18:31.032
I... I guess you could
have eaten the pizza.

18:34.416 --> 18:36.116
Okay.

18:36.184 --> 18:38.084
- Okay.
- I...

18:38.153 --> 18:39.253
I... I'm sorry.

18:39.321 --> 18:41.755
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

18:49.797 --> 18:52.064
All right, I'm gonna bounce.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.967
Uh, but if you want
to watch the "RHONY" reunion,

18:55.035 --> 18:56.702

18:56.771 --> 18:58.671
But, heads-up, it's six nights.

18:58.740 --> 19:00.606

Cary. Cary?

20:43.363 --> 20:44.963
Just give him a second.

20:45.032 --> 20:47.232
He's doing "Call Me by Your Name."

20:47.300 --> 20:49.134
Oh, you know, I never saw that movie.

20:49.202 --> 20:50.947
Yes, you did. We went with Cary.

20:51.010 --> 20:53.438
Remember, he sat facing us
while we watched it.

20:53.507 --> 20:55.741
Oh, yes, that's right.

20:59.713 --> 21:02.247
Aw, they're so cute.

21:02.315 --> 21:04.249
You know, Cary just had
his 14th birthday party.

21:04.317 --> 21:05.486
It was gumball themed.

21:05.533 --> 21:06.885
It was gonna be dinosaurs,

21:06.954 --> 21:09.320
but Target had
a lot of gumball stuff so...

21:09.389 --> 21:10.889
But, hey, everybody loves a gumball,

21:10.958 --> 21:12.457
right, Chasey?

21:12.526 --> 21:14.425
Ugh, he just threw up on me.

21:14.579 --> 21:15.703
Seriously where is the bathroom?

21:15.704 --> 21:16.745
The bathroom is downstairs.

21:16.746 --> 21:18.801
- It is downstairs?
- It's downstairs.

21:18.826 --> 21:20.719
And it's good for both?

21:20.744 --> 21:22.995
- Yes, there's both.
- Okay, great.

21:23.994 --> 21:24.813
Bye buddy.

21:24.838 --> 21:27.412
Did he mean both pee and poop?

21:29.949 --> 21:31.948
Hey everyone, welcome
to "The Other Show."

21:31.973 --> 21:34.264
We're talking about episode eight today.

21:34.265 --> 21:36.546
And we are joined by
Drew and Helene, as always,

21:36.571 --> 21:38.476
and Josh Segarra, who plays Lance.

21:38.501 --> 21:41.042
- What's up guys?
- Yeah!

21:41.256 --> 21:42.507
- Hello!
- What about us?

21:42.532 --> 21:43.515
Hi, hello.

21:43.539 --> 21:45.037
I didn't know if I was
allow to stand up in the...

21:45.038 --> 21:47.369
I was so stressed to
high five on camera.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.024
Whoa! Sick ride, baby!

21:51.049 --> 21:52.131
I got it for Chase.

21:52.132 --> 21:53.782
I think he's wheely gonna like it.

21:53.807 --> 21:55.266
You know, 'cause the wheels.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.058
Hi, Lance.

21:57.059 --> 21:59.091
Now, you guys knew each other?

21:59.116 --> 22:01.912
We've known each other
for like a decade, yeah.

22:01.937 --> 22:03.700
Not super close, but man,

22:03.701 --> 22:05.075
we've been buddies ever since, man.

22:05.076 --> 22:06.199
Just from the theatre world, right?

22:06.200 --> 22:08.770
- 'Cause you do Broadway too, yeah.
- Because we do the theater,

22:08.795 --> 22:10.408
Josh and I know each other.

22:10.409 --> 22:12.896
Our show has so many
Broadway people in it.

22:12.921 --> 22:14.364
Like really trained people.

22:14.389 --> 22:15.411
- And Drew.
- And then Drew.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.255
- Of course.
- And Drew.

22:17.334 --> 22:18.292
I've never seen a stage.

22:18.293 --> 22:19.724
He's never seen a Broadway
show, you've never gone...

22:19.749 --> 22:21.916
Don't like plays. I hate 'em.

22:21.917 --> 22:23.524
You saw Angels in America Part One.

22:23.548 --> 22:25.704
- Yes.
- Did you see the second part?

22:25.729 --> 22:27.554
- I still haven't seen it.
- He came to set and was like,

22:27.579 --> 22:29.543
"I'm gonna go see the second part,"
we were like, "Mm-hmm."

22:29.544 --> 22:31.916
Still hasn't seen it as if it's running

22:31.917 --> 22:33.125
and it's a possibility.

22:35.209 --> 22:37.843
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, um...

22:38.976 --> 22:41.751
- Sex?
- Hell yeah, Care.

22:42.191 --> 22:43.792
That's what I'm talkin about, Care.

22:43.793 --> 22:45.458
Here's a weird thing we just remembered

22:45.459 --> 22:46.542
is that you auditioned for like

22:46.543 --> 22:48.034
a thousand different roles, didn't you?

22:48.059 --> 22:49.738
- I did.
- Sorry.

22:49.763 --> 22:51.409
No way, that was awesome though!

22:51.478 --> 22:53.517
Those are days that actors remember.

22:53.551 --> 22:55.534
You kidding me?
Now that it worked out this way.

22:55.559 --> 22:56.727
- Yeah.
- I remember that day for sure.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.039
I read three different parts.

22:58.064 --> 22:59.100
- I kept going...
- Do you remember it?

22:59.101 --> 23:00.140
Uh-uh, it was the flight attendant,

23:00.141 --> 23:01.124
then it was the roommate,

23:01.149 --> 23:03.015
and that was hilarious 'cause
now I know what happens.

23:03.016 --> 23:04.266
And that's super fun, right?

23:04.267 --> 23:07.168
Imagine that all the time and
that would've been very fun, buddy.

23:07.193 --> 23:08.754
Then they said,

23:08.779 --> 23:10.349
"Hey man, you wanna come
play with this one?"

23:10.350 --> 23:12.766
I said, "Heck yeah, I love this guy."
And it was awesome, man.

23:12.767 --> 23:16.083
We basically had to
make it fit you better.

23:16.108 --> 23:18.099
So we spent a little time with you,

23:18.124 --> 23:19.958
started hearing the words you said.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.391
Like "Oh, hell yeah."

23:21.392 --> 23:23.458
And that became a part...

23:23.483 --> 23:25.811
Your voice became a
part of the character.

23:25.836 --> 23:27.659
I don't know why you're
lying on camera, Sarah,

23:27.684 --> 23:29.890
because we all know that
Lance is your spirit animal.

23:29.891 --> 23:32.003
Lance has lived inside of you for years.

23:32.028 --> 23:33.292
Once I found it, it really came...

23:33.317 --> 23:35.680
I remember going up to you
on set on night and saying

23:35.705 --> 23:37.680
"Can you say, "Oh hell yeah," here?

23:37.705 --> 23:40.758
and you said, "Oh, hell yeah."

23:40.783 --> 23:43.890
No! Gimme that. Give it. Absolutely not.

23:43.891 --> 23:46.308
Not drinking alcohol tonight.
You're 14.

23:46.309 --> 23:48.902
Plus you're contractually
obligated to drink Voss.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.902
What did you do for your
birthdays when you were little?

23:50.927 --> 23:52.950
So in Orlando, where I grew up,

23:52.975 --> 23:55.517
for many years we went to this resort.

23:55.518 --> 23:58.388
So I remember, it's
either my 13th or 14th,

23:58.413 --> 24:01.371
and I remember men,

24:01.396 --> 24:05.076
just beautiful men, in Speedos.

24:05.755 --> 24:07.551
And I remember this pool being
like, "This is the best!"

24:07.576 --> 24:09.895
An arcade, they had
WrestleFest, the video game.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.851
They had an indoor pool,
outdoor pool, but men!

24:11.852 --> 24:14.076
So we go to the top of the slide,

24:14.101 --> 24:15.912
and I meet two men!

24:15.937 --> 24:16.952
Gorgeous men.

24:16.977 --> 24:20.974
And I say, "Guys, what's
going on here, man?"

24:20.975 --> 24:24.023
And it's the first time
I learned what Pride was.

24:24.538 --> 24:26.388
Pride is the weekend of June,

24:26.413 --> 24:28.888
and they were holding
Pride at that resort.

24:28.913 --> 24:30.779
And I was also having my birthday.

24:30.804 --> 24:32.677
So for your 13th
birthday you went to Pride.

24:32.702 --> 24:35.908
Pride at a pool with a slide, an arcade.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.830
- That's great.
- And I made some of the best friends.

24:37.855 --> 24:39.101
Wow!

24:39.102 --> 24:41.759
We grew up differently.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.425
Hey, did he puke on my back at all?

24:43.449 --> 24:45.206
Um... Oh.

24:45.253 --> 24:47.128
Uh, barely.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.115
Well, a lot. He puked a lot.

24:49.140 --> 24:50.350
Yeah, I could feel it.

24:50.351 --> 24:53.309
This is the episode
where these two characters

24:53.310 --> 24:55.893
reconnect, Brooke and Lance.

24:55.894 --> 24:57.392
And we really, when we were writing it,

24:57.393 --> 24:59.221
we were just like, what are...

24:59.246 --> 25:01.572
Almost leaning into
the rom-comness of it.

25:01.580 --> 25:02.679
A little bit of like...

25:02.704 --> 25:04.743
What are these iconic
places we can put them in?

25:04.768 --> 25:06.665
One of them was on the bridge.

25:06.690 --> 25:07.895
- On the Brooklyn Bridge.
- Yeah.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.924
And so we had to shoot...
We had to like sh...

25:09.949 --> 25:11.974
...shut down small part of the bridge

25:11.975 --> 25:14.974
and like redirect tourists
who were very eager

25:14.975 --> 25:17.332
to see who was shooting and then...
they didn't really care.

25:17.357 --> 25:18.996
We gotta be honest.

25:19.021 --> 25:20.043
They liked Case though.

25:20.068 --> 25:22.404
- Case got stopped many times!
- Case got recognized.

25:22.429 --> 25:23.662
Case would get stopped sometimes.

25:23.687 --> 25:25.834
A couple times filming,
people would come up

25:25.859 --> 25:27.964
to me and be like, "Who's
filming over there?"

25:27.989 --> 25:30.884
- And I'd kind of be like, "Uh, me."
- Me.

25:32.427 --> 25:33.597
"Hi, it's me."

25:33.622 --> 25:35.316
To take it down, you sort of think like,

25:35.341 --> 25:36.535
"Oh, I wanna be on a tv show."

25:36.560 --> 25:38.777
And then you're closing off
parts of the Brooklyn Bridge.

25:38.802 --> 25:40.409
You're there waiting
for the sun to go down,

25:40.434 --> 25:42.644
and you're like, "Whoa!"

25:42.669 --> 25:45.092
- It was crazy.
- That was such a special like...

25:45.093 --> 25:47.279
The scene watching those characters have

25:47.304 --> 25:48.385
separated from each other.

25:48.386 --> 25:50.644
You watched him help
your little brother,

25:50.669 --> 25:52.759
and that is, like, I think
something a lot of us

25:52.760 --> 25:54.843
can relate to with past relationships

25:54.844 --> 25:56.712
- is they become a part of your family.
- Of course.

25:56.737 --> 25:57.984
Yeah. Well, it's like you...

25:58.009 --> 25:59.469
I think that she thought that her life

25:59.494 --> 26:01.733
was gonna be this big thing,
and then she...

26:01.758 --> 26:04.134
you know, is faced with this
person who is a part of it,

26:04.135 --> 26:05.983
and she's like, "I don't need this."

26:06.008 --> 26:09.091
Then realizes how important
those simple things are

26:09.092 --> 26:10.422
- and that kind of a connection.
- Yeah.

26:10.447 --> 26:12.305
And not to be too dramatic
'cause this is a comedy thing,

26:12.330 --> 26:14.801
but we did talk about, 'cause we both
have a parent who died,

26:14.802 --> 26:18.091
and we talked about
relating to having an ex

26:18.092 --> 26:20.517
that knew our parent.
And then being like,

26:20.542 --> 26:21.791
we're breaking up with them,

26:21.816 --> 26:24.009
but you still feel a
connection because you're like,

26:24.049 --> 26:26.805
they knew me when I was
then or they knew them.

26:26.830 --> 26:28.572
- And they were there with me while...
- So it was like a homeliness.

26:28.596 --> 26:29.712
...that was happening.

26:29.737 --> 26:31.398
So we kind of liked that about
your character in the season.

26:31.399 --> 26:33.190
That you're introduced as a dummy,

26:33.191 --> 26:35.064
or introduced as a comic relief,

26:35.065 --> 26:37.115
- or as like a this guy.
- Yeah.

26:37.140 --> 26:39.899
But humanizing him throughout
and seeing that he is like

26:39.900 --> 26:42.565
a solid person, he is
like a rock and he is like

26:42.566 --> 26:43.607
- feels like home.
- Home to her.

26:43.608 --> 26:44.791
Yeah, and it's even like on the bridge,

26:44.816 --> 26:48.323
he says something about
his mom's friend's Connie.

26:48.347 --> 26:49.618
- And like, you know...
- Yeah.

26:49.643 --> 26:51.078
- Those are kind of easy connections.
- You just know there's a shorthand.

26:51.128 --> 26:52.648
That you know who Connie is, yeah.

26:52.649 --> 26:55.289
Yeah, in the middle of laughter
you see two people connect.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.821
You know, taking care
of their younger brother.

26:57.846 --> 26:59.158
- You know...
- Totally.

26:59.183 --> 27:01.390
You know, it's very easy to kind
of stay on the surface of stuff,

27:01.415 --> 27:03.523
but you get down to it,

27:03.524 --> 27:04.866
