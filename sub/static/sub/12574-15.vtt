<i>Richard Cypher,</i>

00:22.553 --> 00:25.886
( people coughing )

00:27.350 --> 00:28.448
Ohh.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.819
Seeker?

00:46.820 --> 00:48.251
Our prayers have been answered.

00:52.684 --> 00:53.916
What happened to these people?

00:53.917 --> 00:55.383
They're calling it
Keeper's Blight.

00:55.384 --> 00:57.418
Please, be careful.

00:57.419 --> 00:58.918
It only takes one touch
to pass it on.

01:01.150 --> 01:05.215
Rumor is, it was brought
to our world by banelings.

01:05.217 --> 01:08.251
Who needs a knife when you
can kill with your fingertips?

01:08.252 --> 01:11.085
The sick come here
'cause they believe

01:11.086 --> 01:15.518
that the Monument of Ardris
has the power to heal them.

01:15.519 --> 01:17.984
Most perish within days.

01:17.985 --> 01:19.385
Zedd, maybe the compass
led us here

01:19.386 --> 01:21.652
so we can help them.

01:25.188 --> 01:27.688
( chants in ancient tongue )

01:27.689 --> 01:28.688
( gagging )

01:28.689 --> 01:30.288
Zedd?

01:32.390 --> 01:33.790
This blight...

01:33.791 --> 01:37.154
It's indeed fueled
by powerful black magic.

01:37.155 --> 01:39.555
If I try to absorb it,
it'll kill me.

01:46.248 --> 01:48.181
( <i>ethereal theme playing</i> )

01:59.851 --> 02:02.151
(Kahlan)
No, don't, you'll be killed!

02:09.889 --> 02:12.823
You healed him.

02:12.824 --> 02:14.724
Who are you?

02:16.226 --> 02:17.659
I am the Creator.

02:21.663 --> 02:24.061
All will rejoice in my light.

02:41.604 --> 02:46.773
If she's the Creator,
I'm the Queen of Tamarang.

02:46.774 --> 02:48.206
She's healing people
I couldn't.

02:48.207 --> 02:51.674
Maybe, but the Creator lives
in the Spirit World.

02:51.675 --> 02:55.543
This woman is flesh and blood.

02:55.544 --> 02:57.611
I'm going to find out
who she really is.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.178
Kahlan, be careful.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.645
Whoever she is,
she's very powerful.

03:04.582 --> 03:05.815
May I speak with you.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.618
Of course, Kahlan.

03:09.619 --> 03:13.320
I miss our talks.

03:13.321 --> 03:14.621
I beg your pardon?

03:14.622 --> 03:17.123
You used to pray to me
to take care of your mother

03:17.124 --> 03:19.191
after she died.

03:19.192 --> 03:21.360
And to protect your sister
from your father's brutality.

03:23.729 --> 03:25.896
So many pray
for selfish reasons, Kahlan,

03:25.897 --> 03:27.797
but never you.

03:29.566 --> 03:30.866
(Kahlan)
<i>It's so hard to believe.</i>

03:30.867 --> 03:33.468
Faith is hard.

03:33.469 --> 03:35.870
It is all right
to have doubts.

03:35.871 --> 03:37.338
You wouldn't be
the Mother Confessor

03:37.339 --> 03:40.141
if you weren't inquisitive.

03:40.142 --> 03:43.076
You're wondering,
if I am who I say I am,

03:43.077 --> 03:45.711
why haven't I come
to this world sooner?

03:45.712 --> 03:48.646
Why have I allowed
so much suffering?

03:48.647 --> 03:50.113
The thought did cross my mind.

03:50.114 --> 03:54.482
I wish I could wave this hand
and make the darkness go away.

03:54.483 --> 03:57.484
The Keeper is as powerful
as I am.

03:57.485 --> 03:59.552
And now that the veil
has been torn,

03:59.553 --> 04:00.753
he's growing stronger.

04:00.754 --> 04:03.021
If you are the Creator,

04:03.022 --> 04:05.457
you could tell us where to find
the Stone of Tears.

04:05.458 --> 04:07.325
Even the Stone of Tears
won't save you

04:07.326 --> 04:09.059
if I don't first destroy

04:09.060 --> 04:10.794
the Keeper's
most powerful servant.

04:10.795 --> 04:13.163
Who?

04:16.200 --> 04:17.300
Richard Rahl.

04:17.301 --> 04:19.235
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

04:19.236 --> 04:21.303
Richard isn't a servant
of the Keeper.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.404
The Keeper is devious.

04:22.405 --> 04:24.605
He hides his servants well.

04:24.606 --> 04:26.407
But Richard's actions
clearly show him

04:26.408 --> 04:28.442
to be an enemy of the Light.

04:28.443 --> 04:29.676
But everything he's done--

04:29.677 --> 04:31.777
Has secretly been
to serve the Keeper.

04:31.778 --> 04:34.178
I don't believe that.

04:34.179 --> 04:35.279
Your love for Richard

04:35.280 --> 04:37.614
blinds you
to his true nature, Kahlan.

04:37.615 --> 04:40.783
Just as my love
for the Keeper once blinded me.

04:40.784 --> 04:43.152
You know my story.

04:43.153 --> 04:44.786
Your mother taught it to you.

04:44.787 --> 04:47.055
Yes.

04:47.056 --> 04:48.523
In a time before remembering,

04:48.524 --> 04:50.892
the Keeper's love
for the Creator

04:50.893 --> 04:52.360
brought our world into being.

04:52.361 --> 04:58.232
People were made in their image,
perfect and immortal.

04:58.233 --> 04:59.901
But the Keeper
soon grew jealous

04:59.902 --> 05:01.602
of the Creator's love
for her children.

05:01.603 --> 05:02.603
He made your kind mortal,

05:02.604 --> 05:06.440
so he could murder
our firstborn.

05:06.441 --> 05:07.541
He betrayed me,

05:09.443 --> 05:12.512
brought death and suffering
to the world we had created.

05:14.382 --> 05:17.484
I wept.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.619
So profound was my grief
that it took shape.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.154
The Stone of Tears.

05:21.155 --> 05:25.090
I used it to banish
the one I had loved,

05:25.091 --> 05:28.860
trapping him
in the Underworld for eternity.

05:28.861 --> 05:32.030
It was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.500
Just as seeing
Richard's true nature

05:34.501 --> 05:36.769
will be the hardest thing
you've ever done.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.337
I could have simply
destroyed Richard.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.439
But before I do, I need you

05:39.440 --> 05:41.241
and the First Wizard
to see the truth.

05:41.242 --> 05:43.246
So that he will name
a new Seeker,

05:43.247 --> 05:44.714
and you will agree
to come with me

05:44.715 --> 05:46.349
to a place
where you'll be protected.

05:46.350 --> 05:49.052
It is the only way
to ensure my Prophecy.

05:51.355 --> 05:55.325
"As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

05:55.326 --> 05:57.294
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

06:04.935 --> 06:06.969
People believe in Richard.

06:06.970 --> 06:11.240
He's the only one who's fought
for them in a very long time.

06:11.241 --> 06:13.909
And many of them wonder,
as I often have,

06:13.910 --> 06:16.111
if the Creator
has abandoned them.

06:16.112 --> 06:17.212
If you destroy Richard

06:17.213 --> 06:19.580
without giving him
a chance to defend himself,

06:19.581 --> 06:20.949
the people
may turn against you.

06:22.618 --> 06:25.354
Please.

06:25.355 --> 06:27.222
Please.

06:27.223 --> 06:29.090
Give me a chance to show you

06:29.091 --> 06:30.758
that his heart
and his motives are pure.

06:33.859 --> 06:35.730
You're very important to me,
Kahlan.

06:35.731 --> 06:38.666
You always have been.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.768
If it will help you
and others accept my decision,

06:40.769 --> 06:42.670
then I will hear
what you have to say.

06:42.671 --> 06:44.705
( whispers ):
Ah, thank you.

06:44.706 --> 06:48.776
But the Seeker
will face judgment.

06:48.777 --> 06:50.611
( sighs )

06:53.515 --> 06:55.583
It's a trick.
For all we know,

06:55.584 --> 06:58.454
she's an agent of the Keeper
sent to destroy Richard.

06:58.455 --> 07:01.355
She's telling the truth.

07:01.356 --> 07:03.356
Or at least she believes
what she's saying.

07:03.357 --> 07:06.125
You can't even read
a Mord-Sith.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.027
Yet somehow you know what a
woman this powerful is thinking?

07:09.028 --> 07:11.896
There's more to it.
She knows things.

07:14.066 --> 07:16.099
We should leave.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.134
Now.

07:17.135 --> 07:19.068
Resume the search
for the Stone.

07:19.069 --> 07:22.738
I can't let Richard
find the Stone.

07:22.739 --> 07:25.307
I've quelled the magic
of the compass.

07:29.011 --> 07:30.744
( indistinct chatter )

07:30.745 --> 07:33.480
Forget the compass. Go.

07:33.481 --> 07:36.348
I can repel her magic.

07:36.349 --> 07:37.716
( people gasping )

07:37.717 --> 07:39.518
I don't want to harm you,
Wizard.

07:39.519 --> 07:40.686
Zedd, no!

07:40.687 --> 07:43.222
She may be strong enough
to kill you both.

07:47.627 --> 07:49.261
And if we run,
the people will believe

07:49.262 --> 07:51.297
what she's saying about me.

07:54.101 --> 07:56.402
They'll turn against me,
and we'll never find the Stone.

08:03.743 --> 08:05.377
I've made mistakes,

08:05.378 --> 08:07.445
but I'm not an agent
of the Keeper.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.714
I don't know
if you're the Creator or not,

08:09.715 --> 08:13.818
but I'm not afraid
to be judged by anyone.

08:13.819 --> 08:16.988
Richard Rahl,
you claim to serve the Light.

08:16.989 --> 08:19.524
Tell us,
how have you done so?

08:19.525 --> 08:23.161
I found the Boxes of Orden.

08:23.162 --> 08:26.999
(Richard)
<i>And used them to kill</i>
<i>the tyrant Darken Rahl.</i>

08:27.000 --> 08:28.934
( <i>epic theme playing</i> )

08:34.707 --> 08:35.674
( shrieking )

08:47.820 --> 08:49.887
You say that
in destroying Darken Rahl,

08:49.888 --> 08:51.487
you were serving me,

08:51.488 --> 08:53.188
but tell us, Richard,

08:53.189 --> 08:55.591
what was the result
of Rahl's death?

09:01.730 --> 09:04.098
(Zedd)
This crack in the earth,
it's a tear in the veil

09:04.099 --> 09:06.901
that separates the Underworld
from the World of the Living.

09:06.902 --> 09:08.869
(Kahlan)
How could this have happened?

09:08.870 --> 09:11.505
In all my years as a Wizard,

09:11.506 --> 09:13.573
I've only known
one form of magic

09:13.574 --> 09:15.942
strong enough to tear the veil.

09:15.943 --> 09:18.678
The Power of Orden

09:21.882 --> 09:23.349
This happened
when I killed Rahl,

09:23.350 --> 09:26.953
when the Boxes of Orden
exploded.

09:26.954 --> 09:28.788
As long as it's open,

09:28.789 --> 09:31.057
there's no way to prevent
the Keeper of the Underworld,

09:31.058 --> 09:33.292
the great enemy of all
that walks, breathes,

09:33.293 --> 09:34.994
and grows in the Light,

09:34.995 --> 09:36.896
from sending his minions
to bring death

09:36.897 --> 09:39.031
to every living thing.

09:39.032 --> 09:40.799
Creatures from the Underworld,

09:40.800 --> 09:43.102
banelings
returning from the dead

09:43.103 --> 09:44.303
to terrorize the living.

09:47.107 --> 09:49.575
How many of you were aware
it was the Seeker

09:49.576 --> 09:51.577
who unleashed these horrors
upon the world?

09:51.578 --> 09:53.078
( indistinct muttering )

09:53.079 --> 09:55.314
I didn't do it intentionally.

09:55.315 --> 09:57.216
And I've sworn
to find the Stone.

09:57.217 --> 09:59.218
And if you should find it,
what will you do with it?

09:59.219 --> 10:00.719
Use it to seal the rift.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.689
Are you aware of a Prophecy
that says otherwise?

10:07.694 --> 10:09.428
Yes.

10:09.429 --> 10:11.597
(Richard)
<i>"In the time</i>
<i>of the tearing of the veil,</i>

10:11.598 --> 10:15.634
"should the son of Brennidon
seek the sacred stone,

10:15.635 --> 10:19.071
"he will find it,
only to deliver it

10:19.072 --> 10:21.273
to the Enemy of the Light."

10:21.274 --> 10:23.609
The Creator herself
gives us these Prophecies

10:23.610 --> 10:26.278
to guide our actions.

10:26.279 --> 10:28.147
And yet you continue
your search for the Stone.

10:28.148 --> 10:29.782
I don't believe in Prophecy.

10:29.783 --> 10:32.917
The Prophecy comes from me.

10:32.918 --> 10:34.818
Are you saying you don't
believe in the Creator?

10:34.819 --> 10:36.554
( crowd muttering )

10:42.093 --> 10:44.595
Open your shirt.

10:51.102 --> 10:52.702
Tell everyone what that is.

10:56.939 --> 10:58.707
It's the Mark of the Keeper.

10:58.708 --> 11:01.111
( all gasp )

11:01.112 --> 11:02.445
How did you receive it?

11:03.814 --> 11:06.016
RAHL:
<i>You are for the Keeper.</i>

11:07.585 --> 11:08.986
( screaming )

11:08.987 --> 11:11.154
What did Rahl mean,

11:11.155 --> 11:12.722
"You are <i>for</i> the Keeper"?

11:12.723 --> 11:16.860
Maybe Rahl marked him
because he wanted the Creator

11:16.861 --> 11:19.063
to believe that Richard
had turned against her.

11:20.732 --> 11:24.201
If you really are she,
apparently his plan is working.

11:24.202 --> 11:25.903
The Mark is only bestowed

11:25.904 --> 11:27.738
upon the Keeper's
most loyal servants.

11:27.739 --> 11:29.039
Maia!

11:30.174 --> 11:32.409
Thank the Spirits!

11:32.410 --> 11:34.044
I heard the Creator
had returned

11:34.045 --> 11:35.712
and knew in my heart
it must be you.

11:35.713 --> 11:37.313
Who are you?

11:39.449 --> 11:41.483
I'm her mother.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.954
It is wonderful
to see you again, Mother.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.667
You have a mother?

11:52.912 --> 11:55.179
I was born into this world
as all of you were.

11:55.180 --> 11:58.015
You say you're here
to destroy Richard,

11:58.016 --> 12:00.016
but he would've been
just a child when you were born.

12:00.017 --> 12:01.751
I could foresee the horrors

12:01.752 --> 12:04.185
that will one day
threaten the world.

12:04.186 --> 12:07.422
So 20 years ago, I caused myself
to be born to this woman,

12:07.423 --> 12:10.224
knowing my divine strength
would manifest when I needed it.

12:10.225 --> 12:12.025
That's absurd.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.294
What do you mean,
"manifest"?

12:15.295 --> 12:17.763
This mortal body
couldn't contain my powers

12:17.764 --> 12:20.632
until it came of age.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.801
Creator, more people suffering
from the blight

12:23.802 --> 12:27.238
have come for you
to heal them.

12:27.239 --> 12:30.107
As soon as I've done so,
we will resume.

12:32.743 --> 12:37.446
I always knew one day
she would embrace her divinity.

12:37.447 --> 12:38.614
She doubted it?

12:38.615 --> 12:41.083
It was a heavy burden
for a young girl.

12:41.084 --> 12:42.751
She wanted to be
like everyone else.

12:42.752 --> 12:44.719
But I always knew
my daughter

12:44.720 --> 12:47.422
was the living incarnation
of the Creator.

12:47.423 --> 12:49.790
The truth came to me in a vision
before she was born.

12:49.791 --> 12:52.093
When did you see her last?

12:52.094 --> 12:53.527
Two summers ago.

12:53.528 --> 12:57.097
She ran off with a boy
from our village, Jason.

12:57.098 --> 12:58.965
The Creator ran off
with a boy...

13:00.200 --> 13:01.200
She was at that age.

13:01.201 --> 13:02.634
I knew I had
to let her go,

13:02.635 --> 13:05.537
and have faith tt one day
she would see the truth.

13:05.538 --> 13:07.805
And now she has.

13:07.806 --> 13:09.172
And where is Jason?

13:09.173 --> 13:12.708
They lived in a cabin
south of Rivermore.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.243
Please excuse me.

13:14.244 --> 13:16.177
I want to be with my daughter.

13:16.178 --> 13:18.579
My Creator.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.384
They're both mad.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.086
Maybe so.

13:26.087 --> 13:28.287
Find this Jason.

13:28.288 --> 13:29.855
Mm.

13:29.856 --> 13:32.224
You've left a trail of corpses
in your search for the Stone,

13:32.225 --> 13:34.760
and yet you continue to kill,
knowing that every soul

13:34.761 --> 13:36.629
you send to the Keeper
makes him more powerful.

13:36.630 --> 13:39.231
I only kill
to protect my friends

13:39.232 --> 13:41.600
or other innocent people.

13:41.601 --> 13:43.735
And even then, I only do it
when there's no other choice.

13:43.736 --> 13:45.670
( men grunting )

13:48.409 --> 13:51.310
So you've never killed
for any other reason?

13:51.311 --> 13:55.614
Or when you could have defeated
an enemy some other way?

13:55.615 --> 13:58.385
Yes, once...

13:58.386 --> 13:59.820
( women screaming )

14:08.262 --> 14:12.232
(Richard)
<i>But I wasn't myself.</i>

14:12.233 --> 14:14.633
You could've taken those men
prisoner,

14:14.634 --> 14:16.000
but instead
you slaughtered them.

14:16.001 --> 14:19.232
They were slavers and murderers.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.634
And it wasn't Richard's fault.

14:21.635 --> 14:23.669
He was possessed
by an ancient spell,

14:23.670 --> 14:26.805
and I taught him
to control it.

14:30.843 --> 14:33.444
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

14:35.614 --> 14:37.547
Who dragged you into this fight?

14:37.548 --> 14:41.985
Who are you angry at?

14:44.054 --> 14:46.022
You.

14:46.023 --> 14:49.425
Now we're getting somewhere.

14:49.426 --> 14:51.293
All those years,
you knew who I was

14:51.294 --> 14:52.394
and you said nothing.

14:52.395 --> 14:55.329
You lied to me
about being my grandfather.

14:55.330 --> 14:57.063
You weren't ready for the truth.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.931
You took me out of Hartland.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.600
You named me the Seeker.

15:01.601 --> 15:06.172
You're the one who gave me
this damned Sword!

15:06.173 --> 15:07.573
Richard, no!

15:07.574 --> 15:09.207
No.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.709
He has to stop himself.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.144
Ahh! Uh.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.217
Uh.

15:20.218 --> 15:21.751
He may have refrained
from killing you,

15:21.752 --> 15:23.317
but that doesn't
change the fact

15:23.318 --> 15:24.784
that he sent
slavers and murderers

15:24.785 --> 15:28.553
to the Underworld to join
the Keeper's army of souls.

15:28.554 --> 15:32.323
Only because of the magic
that possessed him.

15:32.324 --> 15:34.591
But he was strong enough
to overcome it.

15:34.592 --> 15:35.926
So you were convinced
it was over,

15:35.927 --> 15:39.828
that Richard would never again
succumb to his rage?

15:46.901 --> 15:48.434
It's okay, Zedd.

15:48.435 --> 15:50.171
We're here to tell the truth.

15:50.172 --> 15:56.477
I did have some doubts.

15:56.478 --> 15:59.147
Kahlan, there's part
of the Minders' story

15:59.148 --> 16:01.416
I didn't tell him.

16:01.417 --> 16:04.886
Canton Rahl, the man who first
put the spell on the Minders,

16:04.887 --> 16:07.389
wasn't always bloodthirsty.

16:07.390 --> 16:10.959
He started out as a protector
and benefactor to his people.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.062
But then as his powers grew,

16:14.063 --> 16:16.364
he began to fight and to kill,

16:16.365 --> 16:17.933
and the more he killed,

16:17.934 --> 16:20.669
the more the blood lust
overtook him.

16:20.670 --> 16:22.104
He went mad with it.

16:22.105 --> 16:26.841
And now we know
that darkness is in Richard.

16:26.842 --> 16:29.845
(Kahlan)
But Richard learned
to control the Sword.

16:29.846 --> 16:31.647
He mastered his rage.

16:31.648 --> 16:33.248
Yes.

16:33.249 --> 16:35.784
He controlled the Sword today.

16:35.785 --> 16:37.286
But what about tomorrow?

16:40.823 --> 16:44.592
But my doubts were fleeting.

16:44.593 --> 16:47.995
I am convinced that any rage
Richard may still carry

16:47.996 --> 16:50.898
will never again
get the better of him.

16:52.167 --> 16:55.536
How can you be so sure?

16:55.537 --> 16:57.972
Because I've given up the magic
that fueled my anger.

17:00.208 --> 17:02.376
Tell us how you did that.

17:02.377 --> 17:04.678
(Woman)
<i>Say the words with me.</i>

17:04.679 --> 17:06.613
( chanting in ancient tongue )

17:20.761 --> 17:21.795
Uh!

17:23.631 --> 17:26.968
You were the most powerful
wizard born in 3000 years,

17:26.969 --> 17:29.603
yet you gave your powers
to someone you hardly knew.

17:29.604 --> 17:30.938
The magic would have killed me.

17:30.939 --> 17:32.540
I didn't have a choice.

17:32.541 --> 17:34.708
You could have stayed
at the Palace of the Prophets,

17:34.709 --> 17:37.077
mastered your wizard powers,

17:37.078 --> 17:39.480
learned how to use them
to serve me.

17:39.481 --> 17:41.216
The Sisters of the Light
told you this,

17:41.217 --> 17:42.383
but you didn't listen.

17:42.384 --> 17:43.583
They lied to me.

17:43.584 --> 17:44.984
Because they were afraid

17:44.985 --> 17:47.117
you would resume your mission
in service of the Keeper,

17:47.118 --> 17:48.385
which is exactly
what happened.

17:48.386 --> 17:49.853
I don't serve the Keeper.

17:49.854 --> 17:52.455
No? Tell us.

17:52.456 --> 17:54.557
This woman
you gave your powers to.

17:54.558 --> 17:56.625
Is she a Sister of the Light?

17:56.626 --> 17:58.293
No, she's a Sister
of the Dark.

17:58.294 --> 18:02.430
And whom do
the Sisters of the Dark serve?

18:02.431 --> 18:03.430
The Keeper.

18:03.431 --> 18:04.931
( crowd gasping )

18:04.932 --> 18:07.066
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

18:07.067 --> 18:09.735
You knew this, and yet you still
gave this woman your powers.

18:09.736 --> 18:13.339
I made sure she couldn't
keep using them.

18:28.658 --> 18:33.860
Now the Sisters
won't be able to follow you.

18:33.861 --> 18:37.629
All that power. Useless.

18:37.630 --> 18:39.498
With the rada'han
around her neck,

18:39.499 --> 18:41.432
she couldn't use my magic.

18:41.433 --> 18:46.969
So she was never able
to harm anyone, ever again?

18:46.970 --> 18:50.005
No. She escaped.
I don't know how.

18:50.006 --> 18:51.306
I do.

18:51.307 --> 18:54.243
The Keeper has agents
everywhere,

18:54.244 --> 18:55.944
and not all of them
walk on two legs.

19:23.736 --> 19:28.306
Your magic, your han,
was a divine gift from me,

19:28.307 --> 19:30.875
but you gave it willingly
to a Sister of the Dark.

19:30.876 --> 19:34.077
How can you expect us
to believe

19:34.078 --> 19:35.578
that you are not
an agent of the Keeper?

19:41.532 --> 19:43.666
Richard.

19:46.069 --> 19:50.805
Hey, what are you thinking?

19:50.806 --> 19:51.806
Honestly?

19:51.807 --> 19:54.442
Yeah.

19:54.443 --> 19:59.147
I'm thinking maybe
the Prophecy is true.

19:59.148 --> 20:02.784
Maybe I'll fail.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.420
You've always said
you don't believe in Prophecy.

20:05.421 --> 20:09.389
There was a Prophecy
that said I'd defeat Rahl.

20:09.390 --> 20:10.757
Maybe I can't ignore
this one

20:10.758 --> 20:13.094
just because I don't like
what it says about me.

20:13.095 --> 20:15.564
Richard, this woman,

20:15.565 --> 20:17.365
I don't know
if she is the Creator

20:17.366 --> 20:19.401
or some kind of charlatan.

20:19.402 --> 20:21.102
Cara's trying to find out.

20:21.103 --> 20:25.540
But whoever she is,
tomorrow,

20:25.541 --> 20:28.109
we're going to tell
your side of the story.

20:28.110 --> 20:30.211
She and everyone else here

20:30.212 --> 20:34.148
is going to see
what I have never doubted.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.550
Your heart is pure.

20:35.551 --> 20:41.222
You are and always will be
on the side of good.

20:43.558 --> 20:44.825
What if I'm not?

20:44.826 --> 20:47.260
How can you say that?

20:47.261 --> 20:49.229
I'd never willfully
do the Keeper's bidding.

20:49.230 --> 20:54.035
But what if I'm serving him
without even realizing it.

20:54.036 --> 20:55.702
Maybe that's what this is.

20:55.703 --> 20:58.604
Some way of controlling me.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.707
Making me think the wrong
decision is the right one.

21:04.112 --> 21:07.480
Maybe I'm an agent of the Keeper
and I don't even know it.

21:18.126 --> 21:19.427
Hello?

21:26.435 --> 21:28.469
Jason?

21:33.407 --> 21:35.341
( women grunting )

21:50.990 --> 21:51.956
( cries out )

21:58.397 --> 21:59.597
I'm guessing you're Jason.

21:59.598 --> 22:01.431
Are you going to kill me too?

22:01.432 --> 22:04.000
Not if you tell me the truth
about Maia.

22:08.641 --> 22:10.976
( gasps )

22:10.977 --> 22:13.879
What a pleasure this is.

22:13.880 --> 22:17.216
It's not often I'm fortunate
enough to enjoy the company

22:17.217 --> 22:22.121
of two such devout
Sisters of the Light.

22:22.122 --> 22:23.456
I would offer you the chance

22:23.457 --> 22:25.658
to return to the world
as banelings,

22:25.659 --> 22:29.295
but alas,
you're both far too pious

22:29.296 --> 22:31.465
to accept the Keeper's
generous proposal.

22:34.836 --> 22:36.835
Do your worst to us,
Darken Rahl.

22:36.836 --> 22:40.301
You and your Master
will soon be finished,

22:40.302 --> 22:42.000
now that the Creator
has returned

22:42.001 --> 22:44.134
to defeat all those
who serve the Darkness.

22:44.135 --> 22:46.069
Returned?

22:46.070 --> 22:48.304
How?

22:48.305 --> 22:49.639
Where?

22:49.640 --> 22:54.577
You will soon learn everything.

22:54.578 --> 22:56.546
But not from us.

22:56.547 --> 22:59.315
Then allow me
to loosen your tongues.

23:01.285 --> 23:04.053
( screaming )

23:05.791 --> 23:10.461
(Kahlan)
The Seeker is an agent
of light and justice.

23:10.462 --> 23:13.297
And I have faith
that every one of you

23:13.298 --> 23:16.767
will soon shed any doubts
that you may have about him.

23:16.768 --> 23:19.803
Every one of you.

23:19.804 --> 23:21.536
No one has slain more

23:21.537 --> 23:23.270
of the Keeper's servants
than Richard.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.503
Perhaps most terrifying of all

23:25.504 --> 23:29.138
was a creature
known as a screeling.

23:29.139 --> 23:31.539
Tell us what happened
when one of them

23:31.540 --> 23:32.707
crawled out of the rift.

23:32.708 --> 23:34.542
It attacked the people
of Ehrengard.

23:34.543 --> 23:37.112
( loud squealing )

23:37.113 --> 23:39.048
( men yelling and grunting )

23:41.485 --> 23:43.453
Hey!

23:43.454 --> 23:44.855
( <i>heroic theme playing</i> )

23:44.856 --> 23:49.461
You wanna rip somebody's
head off, take mine!

23:52.331 --> 23:55.766
Ahh!

23:57.135 --> 23:58.969
( grunting )

24:01.406 --> 24:04.275
Uh, Zedd, now! Ah.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.613
( screeching stops )

24:28.165 --> 24:30.232
( crowd cheering )

24:33.870 --> 24:35.604
Richard killed
the Keeper's pet,

24:35.605 --> 24:38.407
but the Keeper
has many fearsome servants.

24:38.408 --> 24:43.378
I'm sure by now
you all know about banelings.

24:43.379 --> 24:48.517
Ordinary people,
men, women, even children

24:48.518 --> 24:51.086
who have died but agreed to kill
for the Keeper every day

24:51.087 --> 24:53.188
in exchange for a second life.

24:53.189 --> 24:54.856
Tell us about the first time

24:54.857 --> 24:58.126
you encountered
this horrible new enemy.

24:58.127 --> 25:00.262
It was at a place
called Tothrayne.

25:00.263 --> 25:01.796
(Men)
Uhh!

25:01.797 --> 25:03.832
( men grunting and shouting )

25:06.469 --> 25:07.970
(Man)
They've all gone!

25:07.971 --> 25:10.372
(Richard)
Not all of us.

25:15.711 --> 25:19.780
Welcome back to Tothrayne.

25:19.781 --> 25:22.016
Ahh!

25:24.385 --> 25:26.318
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

25:34.128 --> 25:36.062
Ahh!

25:45.272 --> 25:46.773
Why would the Seeker
have slaughtered

25:46.774 --> 25:49.774
so many of the Keeper's minions

25:49.775 --> 25:52.310
if he himself
were an agent of the Keeper?

25:52.311 --> 25:54.045
What better way for Richard
to gain the trust

25:54.046 --> 25:55.779
of t Mother Confessor
and the First Wizard

25:55.780 --> 25:58.615
than to slay a few
of the Keeper's pawns?

25:58.616 --> 26:00.351
You may have destroyed
a few banelings,

26:00.352 --> 26:02.253
but isn't it true
that there are thousands of them

26:02.254 --> 26:04.455
wandering the land,
biding their time

26:04.456 --> 26:07.423
until they can make
their next kill?

26:21.138 --> 26:22.738
Lord Rahl.

26:22.739 --> 26:24.706
How may I serve you?

26:24.707 --> 26:27.473
I've been told that
the Creator has returned

26:27.474 --> 26:30.643
to the World of the Living
as flesh and blood.

26:30.644 --> 26:34.112
I'm instructing all my banelings
to search for her.

26:34.113 --> 26:36.351
If it's true, she shouldn't
be hard to find.

26:36.352 --> 26:38.655
Surely the deluded masses
will be abuzz

26:38.656 --> 26:40.158
with the news of her arrival.

26:40.159 --> 26:42.028
I will try to find her,
My Lord.

26:42.029 --> 26:45.032
But if it is true,
she will be trying to seal us

26:45.033 --> 26:48.234
back in the Underworld
for all eternity.

26:48.235 --> 26:50.469
If the Creator has been
foolish enough to return

26:50.470 --> 26:53.539
in a mortal body,
then she is vulnerable,

26:53.540 --> 26:57.675
and it is I who shall
extinguish Her Light

26:57.676 --> 27:00.811
for all eternity.

27:04.938 --> 27:06.338
Tell us, Seeker,

27:06.339 --> 27:08.740
have you seen Darken Rahl again,
since the day he marked you?

27:08.741 --> 27:11.942
Yes. In the Underworld.

27:11.943 --> 27:14.978
( crowd gasping )

27:14.979 --> 27:17.013
And how did you come
to be there?

27:17.014 --> 27:19.115
I was killed.

27:19.116 --> 27:21.118
Goodbye, Seeker.

27:23.488 --> 27:26.156
(Richard)
<i>And when I opened my eyes,</i>

27:26.157 --> 27:28.259
<i>I was in a sea of dead souls.</i>

27:29.661 --> 27:31.596
( souls grunting and yelling )

27:38.603 --> 27:42.538
How wonderful to see you again,
my brother.

27:42.539 --> 27:44.773
Welcome to the Underworld.

27:47.811 --> 27:50.779
And what did he say to you?

27:50.780 --> 27:52.148
He made me an offer.

27:52.149 --> 27:54.650
Become a baneling.

27:54.651 --> 27:57.320
Return to your body
before it's too late.

27:57.321 --> 27:59.155
You're a fool if you think
I'm going to kill

27:59.156 --> 28:00.990
to serve the Keeper.

28:00.991 --> 28:02.591
You've already killed
enough people

28:02.592 --> 28:04.760
to earn yourself
a place of honor here.

28:04.761 --> 28:06.328
What difference
will a few more make?

28:06.329 --> 28:08.798
I won't do the Keeper's bidding.

28:08.799 --> 28:11.500
You do the Keeper's bidding
every time you take a life.

28:11.501 --> 28:15.537
The reason you kill
doesn't make a difference.

28:15.538 --> 28:17.573
You want to see your beloved
Kahlan again, don't you?

28:17.574 --> 28:22.077
Kahlan will go on without me,
and so will Zedd.

28:22.078 --> 28:24.178
He'll name a new Seeker.

28:24.179 --> 28:28.182
They'll find the Stone of Tears
and seal the rift,

28:28.183 --> 28:29.184
and you and your master

28:29.185 --> 28:31.052
will be trapped
in this pit forever.

28:31.053 --> 28:33.421
Why would the Seeker
turn down an offer

28:33.422 --> 28:34.822
for a second chance at life

28:34.823 --> 28:38.926
if he is now, and was then,
an agent of the Keeper?

28:38.927 --> 28:42.462
We have only Richard's word
for what he and his brother

28:42.463 --> 28:44.497
said to each other that day.

28:44.498 --> 28:47.734
Even I cannot see
into the realm of Death.

28:47.735 --> 28:51.405
Would you have us believe that
Richard accepted Rahl's offer?

28:51.406 --> 28:52.940
That he is a baneling?

28:52.941 --> 28:56.042
No, the Keeper and his agents
are too clever.

28:56.043 --> 28:58.645
They knew Richard
would be brought back

28:58.646 --> 29:01.147
to the world
of the living by other means.

29:01.148 --> 29:02.681
Tell us how it is
that the Seeker

29:02.682 --> 29:05.317
is standing here again today

29:08.021 --> 29:11.125
We used magic to revive him.

29:17.565 --> 29:19.799
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

29:29.076 --> 29:30.943
Richard?

29:36.850 --> 29:38.985
( sighs )

29:40.854 --> 29:42.988
Richard didn't need
to become a baneling

29:42.989 --> 29:45.157
because he knew the people
he had tricked into loving him

29:45.158 --> 29:46.759
would stop at nothing
to bring him back.

29:46.760 --> 29:51.430
You have revealed
through Prophecy that

29:51.431 --> 29:53.566
"As long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

29:53.567 --> 29:55.301
the Keeper is doomed to fail."

29:55.302 --> 29:56.401
I have.

29:56.402 --> 29:58.403
Then it stands to reason

29:58.404 --> 30:01.440
that if the Seeker
were an agent of the Keeper,

30:01.441 --> 30:03.142
he would have killed
the Mother Confessor

30:03.143 --> 30:06.177
as so many of the Keeper's
minions have tried to do.

30:06.178 --> 30:13.084
And yet, the Seeker has done
precisely the opposite.

30:15.220 --> 30:16.954
Tell us, Mother Confessor,

30:16.955 --> 30:20.256
how many times
has the Seeker saved your life?

30:20.257 --> 30:24.193
More times than I can remember.

30:24.194 --> 30:25.694
The first was the day we met.

30:25.695 --> 30:26.995
Stay back!

30:26.996 --> 30:28.263
Shoot her.

30:30.033 --> 30:31.700
Ahh!

30:31.701 --> 30:33.636
Leave her alone!

30:33.637 --> 30:36.170
(Kahlan)
<i>He saved me again at Tothrayne.</i>

30:39.375 --> 30:41.109
Uh!

30:44.779 --> 30:46.747
<i>He did it again at Stowecroft.</i>

30:51.119 --> 30:55.289
The Mother Confessor's word
is final.

30:55.290 --> 30:57.624
These heroic deeds you describe,

30:57.625 --> 30:59.994
they all happened before
I revealed my Prophecy.

30:59.995 --> 31:03.698
Even after the Prophecy
was known to him,

31:03.699 --> 31:06.467
the Seeker protected
the Mother Confessor's life

31:06.468 --> 31:08.636
when it was threatened
by a Sister of the Dark.

31:08.637 --> 31:11.806
If you don't do as I say,
the Mother Confessor will die.

31:16.311 --> 31:18.947
We can't let her do this.

31:18.948 --> 31:21.048
She's using my life
as a weapon against you.

31:21.049 --> 31:22.817
Right now,
we don't have a choice.

31:22.818 --> 31:25.419
Zedd will find a way
to undo the spell.

31:27.288 --> 31:29.189
Whatever happens,

31:29.190 --> 31:31.591
do not let her get the stone.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.962
I won't let anything
happen to you.

31:35.963 --> 31:38.365
So you left the Mother Confessor
to go with a Sister of the Dark.

31:38.366 --> 31:39.967
Why?

31:39.968 --> 31:41.502
She cast a maternity spell.

31:41.503 --> 31:43.170
Anything that would happen
to the Sister

31:43.171 --> 31:44.338
would happen to Kahlan.

31:44.339 --> 31:46.273
I had to protect her.

31:46.274 --> 31:48.609
Then you found a way
to remove the spell?

31:48.610 --> 31:49.777
No. Zedd did.

31:49.778 --> 31:52.679
So it was in fact
the First Wizard

31:52.680 --> 31:54.648
who saved
the Mother Confessor's life

31:54.649 --> 31:56.650
while you used a pretext
to spend days alone

31:56.651 --> 31:57.751
with a Sister of the Dark.

31:57.752 --> 32:00.186
You're twisting
everything I say!

32:00.187 --> 32:01.721
If Richard
were working for the Keeper,

32:01.722 --> 32:03.689
why hasn't he simply
run me through with his Sword?

32:03.690 --> 32:06.191
Because he needs your help
to find the Stone.

32:06.192 --> 32:10.362
But if I allow him to find it,
he will no doubt kill you,

32:10.363 --> 32:13.865
deliver the Stone to the Keeper,
and the World will be lost.

32:13.866 --> 32:15.934
( crowd gasping )

32:18.271 --> 32:20.806
(Cara)
Richard! Kahlan!

32:20.807 --> 32:23.943
Don't listen to her.
This woman is a fraud.

32:23.944 --> 32:25.010
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

32:30.555 --> 32:33.522
This man is Maia's husband.

32:33.523 --> 32:34.823
They were living a quiet life

32:34.824 --> 32:40.293
until the Sisters of the Light
abducted her.

32:40.294 --> 32:41.460
I went with them willingly.

32:41.461 --> 32:44.195
Because they put
some kind of spell on you, Maia.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.197
That's not true, Jason.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.866
The Sisters
are my most devoted servants.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.701
Is that why they were
holding Jason prisoner

32:50.702 --> 32:53.670
and tried to kill me?

32:53.671 --> 32:54.804
They were protecting Jason,

32:54.805 --> 32:57.674
helping him accept my Light.

32:59.077 --> 33:03.581
Jason, tell us
about your life with Maia.

33:06.118 --> 33:09.554
We were so happy
until they came.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.263
Creator.

33:23.969 --> 33:25.470
At last we've found you.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.539
This is madness!

33:27.540 --> 33:29.207
The Sacred Scrolls told us
we would find you

33:29.208 --> 33:31.409
in this province on this day,
and here you are.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.211
Get out of our house!

33:41.386 --> 33:43.053
We both knew
this day might come.

33:43.054 --> 33:45.489
Because of your mother's
visions.

33:45.490 --> 33:48.658
She's out of her mind,
you told me so yourself.

33:48.659 --> 33:54.696
I tried to deny it, but I can
see now I was wrong.

33:54.697 --> 33:56.631
These Sisters have come for me,

33:56.632 --> 33:59.067
just as my mother
always said they would.

33:59.068 --> 34:02.604
Maia, you're not the Creator,

34:02.605 --> 34:04.539
you're my wife.

34:04.540 --> 34:07.042
I don't know what kind of spell
they've put on you,

34:07.043 --> 34:09.610
but I won't let you go.

34:09.612 --> 34:12.580
Creator,
I know you love this man

34:12.581 --> 34:15.049
as you love
all your children.

34:15.050 --> 34:17.585
And it would be dangerous for
him if he tried to follow us.

34:17.587 --> 34:20.755
Perhaps one of my Sisters
and I should stay behind,

34:20.755 --> 34:22.422
watch over him,

34:22.424 --> 34:26.628
help him to accept the truth
of who you really are.

34:29.697 --> 34:32.297
Maia?

34:38.038 --> 34:40.205
I'm sorry, Jason,

34:40.206 --> 34:43.475
but I must go with them.

34:43.476 --> 34:47.411
The fate of the world I created
depends on it.

34:47.411 --> 34:49.179
Maia.

34:51.417 --> 34:54.050
Maia.

34:56.685 --> 34:59.786
Jason, before that day, have you
ever seen Maia use magic?

34:59.787 --> 35:02.487
No.

35:02.488 --> 35:03.889
She was an ordinary girl.

35:03.890 --> 35:08.260
So how does an ordinary girl
suddenly become the Creator?

35:08.261 --> 35:11.797
I told you, my divine strength
could not manifest

35:11.798 --> 35:14.433
until my body was mature enough
to contain it.

35:14.434 --> 35:17.902
So tell us,
did the Sisters of the Light

35:17.903 --> 35:20.171
help you manifest
this divine strength?

35:20.172 --> 35:23.174
Yes,

35:23.175 --> 35:25.909
exactly as the ancient scrolls
predicted.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.582
The scrolls also tell us
you are to destroy

35:32.583 --> 35:35.951
the Keeper's deadliest servant,
the Seeker.

35:35.952 --> 35:38.322
Destroy the Seeker?

35:38.323 --> 35:39.592
Why?

35:39.593 --> 35:42.762
We tried to show Richard
the path to your light,

35:42.763 --> 35:44.197
but he refused us.

35:44.198 --> 35:47.767
You are the only one who will
have the power to stop him.

35:47.768 --> 35:51.237
What power
are you talking about, Prelate?

35:51.238 --> 35:52.771
I don't have any magic.

35:52.772 --> 35:55.140
This has always been
the holy purpose

35:55.141 --> 35:56.341
of the Sisters of the Light.

35:56.342 --> 35:57.843
For centuries,
we have been gathering

35:57.844 --> 36:00.211
the most powerful han
in the world,

36:00.212 --> 36:02.281
preparing for this day

36:02.282 --> 36:06.384
when we would return
that power to its divine source.

36:06.385 --> 36:08.152
You.

36:08.153 --> 36:11.054
One by one, the Sisters
surrendered their han to me.

36:11.055 --> 36:13.089
( chanting in ancient tongue )

36:20.561 --> 36:22.328
How many of them
gave you their magic?

36:22.329 --> 36:25.064
All of them.

36:25.065 --> 36:27.000
( chanting continues )

36:31.505 --> 36:34.407
You're not the Creator.

36:34.408 --> 36:36.711
The Sisters of the Light
created you.

36:38.314 --> 36:41.416
The Prelate lied to you,
just like she lied to Richard.

36:41.417 --> 36:45.053
Silence. There is another
agent of the Keeper among us.

36:45.054 --> 36:46.221
( crowd whispering )

36:48.925 --> 36:50.325
Baneling!

36:51.460 --> 36:54.062
Zedd!

36:54.063 --> 36:55.863
Ahh!

36:58.601 --> 37:01.235
You have nothing to fear.
Now that I have returned,

37:01.236 --> 37:04.772
all the servants
of the Keeper will be destroyed.

37:04.773 --> 37:06.340
All of them.

37:06.341 --> 37:07.375
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

37:12.536 --> 37:16.338
I sincerely hope your demise
was not in vain, Drago.

37:16.339 --> 37:19.943
No, My Lord. I found her.

37:19.944 --> 37:23.513
The Creator.
You're certain?

37:23.514 --> 37:24.748
Yes.

37:24.749 --> 37:26.317
She's at the Monument
of Ardris.

37:26.318 --> 37:31.389
She's there to pass judgment
on the Seeker.

37:31.390 --> 37:32.891
(Keeper)
<i>The Creator, are you certain?</i>

37:32.892 --> 37:36.328
As certain as I can be, Master.

37:36.329 --> 37:39.365
She has demonstrated
great power.

37:39.366 --> 37:40.933
She has cured the blight

37:40.934 --> 37:42.334
our banelings
have been spreading.

37:42.335 --> 37:45.004
(Keeper)
<i>Open a rift, bring her to me.</i>

37:45.005 --> 37:47.674
I will do as you command,
Keeper,

37:47.675 --> 37:51.612
but my baneling has told me
the Seeker is with her.

37:51.613 --> 37:54.682
If I open a rift
then he will die too,

37:54.683 --> 37:56.984
and we cannot let that happen,
not yet.

37:56.985 --> 37:58.018
He is too valuable.

37:58.019 --> 38:01.087
The Creator herself
has prophesied

38:01.088 --> 38:03.054
that he will deliver us
the Stone of Tears.

38:03.055 --> 38:05.555
(Keeper)
<i>Open a rift, Darken Rahl.</i>

38:05.556 --> 38:07.951
<i>I've been separated</i>
<i>from the Creator</i>

38:07.952 --> 38:09.484
<i>since the world began.</i>

38:09.485 --> 38:13.118
<i>I must know that this woman</i>
<i>is truly my beloved.</i>

38:13.119 --> 38:16.122
<i>Use all the power</i>
<i>I've bestowed upon you</i>

38:16.123 --> 38:19.725
<i>and bring her to me now.</i>

38:19.726 --> 38:21.193
The Sisters of the Light

38:21.194 --> 38:23.395
have been working against
Richard from the beginning.

38:23.396 --> 38:25.964
First, they trapped him
in their palace.

38:25.965 --> 38:29.167
Then they left him to die
in the Valley of Perdition.

38:29.168 --> 38:34.871
When they failed, they sent
a false Creator to execute him.

38:34.872 --> 38:38.674
This hearing is over.
My judgment is final.

38:38.675 --> 38:40.342
Richard Rahl is an agent
of the Keeper

38:40.343 --> 38:42.743
and will be destroyed.

38:42.744 --> 38:46.546
You're not going to lay a finger
on my grandson.

38:46.547 --> 38:47.947
Stand aside.

38:49.116 --> 38:51.850
All of you.

38:54.788 --> 38:57.023
( <i>epic theme playing</i> )

39:02.164 --> 39:03.831
Cara, no!

39:03.832 --> 39:06.567
Ah!

39:06.568 --> 39:08.803
( rumbling )

39:11.674 --> 39:13.608
(Woman)
What's happening?

39:13.609 --> 39:14.608
Maia?

39:14.609 --> 39:15.610
(Man)
Run!

39:15.611 --> 39:17.478
It's the Keeper.

39:17.479 --> 39:20.014
He's opening a rift
directly under us!

39:22.118 --> 39:23.919
Let's get these people
outta here!

39:23.920 --> 39:26.422
(Zedd)
Run back!

39:31.595 --> 39:32.929
Get down.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.431
Come on, come on, get up.

40:00.558 --> 40:01.959
We gotta get outta here,
come on.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.595
No. I can close the rift.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.235
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

40:31.354 --> 40:32.754
( panting )

40:32.755 --> 40:35.957
(Keeper)
<i>You have failed me,</i>
<i>Darken Rahl!</i>

40:35.958 --> 40:38.892
Forgive me, Master.

40:48.265 --> 40:51.165
Why did you push me
out of the way?

40:51.166 --> 40:53.435
I don't know
if you're the Creator or not,

40:53.436 --> 40:55.004
but either way
you're flesh and blood.

40:55.005 --> 40:57.340
That stone
would have killed you.

40:57.341 --> 41:01.076
The Seeker risked his life
to save yours,

41:01.077 --> 41:02.978
even after you condemned
him to death.

41:05.414 --> 41:07.148
The truth couldn't be clearer.

41:10.118 --> 41:12.020
Richard is good.

41:12.021 --> 41:13.588
You have to see that.

41:15.290 --> 41:17.458
You can't destroy him.

41:17.459 --> 41:21.861
I used all my han
to seal the rift.

41:21.862 --> 41:23.263
I couldn't destroy
the Seeker now,

41:23.264 --> 41:25.231
even if I wanted to.

41:25.232 --> 41:27.766
( sighs )

41:30.436 --> 41:33.404
But the Mother Confessor
is right.

41:33.405 --> 41:35.105
I can see now by his actions

41:35.106 --> 41:36.573
that the Seeker
is clearly on the side

41:36.574 --> 41:38.608
of good and Light.

41:42.546 --> 41:44.846
( compass chirps )

41:46.015 --> 41:47.382
(Richard)
It's working again.

41:47.383 --> 41:51.452
Without her powers,
Maia can't quell its magic.

41:51.453 --> 41:52.953
Which way is it telling us
to go?

41:52.954 --> 41:56.123
Maybe we don't need
to know.

41:56.124 --> 41:59.293
Maia, can you tell us
where to find the Stone?

41:59.294 --> 42:00.461
( crowd gasping )

42:00.462 --> 42:00.695
(Kahlan)
She's gone.

42:09.616 --> 42:11.984
The Creator?
She was just a deluded girl

42:11.985 --> 42:15.588
who was manipulated
by the Sisters of the Light.

42:15.589 --> 42:17.623
I can't explain
some of the things she knew

42:17.624 --> 42:19.324
about Richard and me.

42:19.325 --> 42:21.760
You were raised
by the Sisters of the Light,

42:21.761 --> 42:23.729
and Richard was a prisoner
in their Palace.

42:23.730 --> 42:26.264
They obviously told Maia
what they knew.

42:26.265 --> 42:28.333
Some of the things Maia knew
I never told anyone.

42:28.334 --> 42:33.070
With that much power, maybe
she could read our thoughts.

42:33.071 --> 42:36.475
There is another possibility.

42:36.476 --> 42:39.611
Maybe she was exactly
who she claimed to be.
