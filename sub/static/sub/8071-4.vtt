How long do we
have to stay here?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.952
Just till your dad gets back.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.088
Why?

00:20.121 --> 00:22.190
Do you have some date
with Mark or something?

00:22.223 --> 00:24.658
No, we're fighting.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.826
What about?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.261
Well, he's a pig.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.263
And the whole world
revolves around him.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.665
I swear, Mother,
I'm so sick of it.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.568
I'm thinking of
telling him to bug off.

Don't toy with me, Becky.

Hey, look!

00:47.115 --> 00:48.582
It's a little baby bike.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.352
Get off it, honey,
you'll kill it.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.154
Yeah, I thought it was
cute, so I took it in trade

00:53.187 --> 00:54.722
for that Triumph I rebuilt.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.657
That was a $7,000 bike.

00:56.690 --> 01:00.161
Oh my, then what am I doing
with those $8,000 check?

Oh, this is great, you guys!

01:07.201 --> 01:08.102
Can I get a car?

01:08.136 --> 01:09.737
No!

01:09.770 --> 01:11.505
But we just got
all this money.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.406
It's for us!

01:12.440 --> 01:16.377
Yeah, get your own money, see?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.379
So how much can we get
for this here scooter?

01:18.412 --> 01:19.647
I don't know, a
couple hundred bucks.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.283
It's well built, low
mileage, good engine.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.551
It's a good little scooter.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.354
Let's haul it out there
to the showroom floor.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.521
No.

01:27.555 --> 01:31.292
I don't want it out there
with the real bikes.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.093
- I'll take it.
- Huh, no way.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.328
Out of the question.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.729
Why not?

01:35.763 --> 01:37.097
I don't think
you can handle it.

Well, you don't know that
until you give me a chance.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.901
Becky, I gotta go
deal with a customer.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.703
The answer is no.
- Mom.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.272
- He said no.
- Hi.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.806
BECKY: This is so
hypocritical of you guys!

BECKY: Mom, Dad

01:49.810 --> 01:53.281
I mean, he must think that--

01:53.314 --> 01:55.283
Can I help you?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.585
Yeah, uh, I was thinking
about getting one of these.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.919
You ever ride before?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.288
No.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.490
Well, what we have here is
mainly restored classics, which

02:02.523 --> 02:05.559
is perfect for the first-timer.

Feel it.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.100
Dad, you're being
really unfair.

02:20.708 --> 02:21.975
BECKY: Give me one good reason.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.211
ROSEANNE: Because bikes kill.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.279
OK, Becky?

02:25.313 --> 02:27.548
I mean, just ask
your Aunt Jackie.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.750
When she was a cop, she
used to scrape kids like you

02:29.783 --> 02:31.051
off the street all the time.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.753
And don't think a helmet
is going to help, either.

your brains after they

02:34.722 --> 02:36.089

What happened to
bikes are dangerous?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.683
Well, I used to think that
till you said what you said.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.984
What'd I say?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.621
No daughter of mine
is going to ride a bike.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.155
That is what you said, Dan.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.457
No daughter of mine
is riding a bike.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.793
You know, like it's OK for
a boy but not for a girl.

04:19.827 --> 04:20.928
No.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.431
I meant Becky's my
daughter, and no daughter

04:23.464 --> 04:26.266
of mine, such as Becky, is
going to ride a motorcycle.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.167
Oh, bull.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.068
It's true!

04:28.101 --> 04:29.136
Oh, yeah?

04:29.169 --> 04:31.171
Well if DJ was 17
and he wanted a bike,

04:31.204 --> 04:32.105
would you let him have one?

04:35.543 --> 04:38.078
You really want Becky risking
her life on a motorcycle?

04:38.111 --> 04:40.147
Well, if the only reason
that you're saying no

04:40.180 --> 04:42.282
is because she's
a girl, then yes!

04:46.253 --> 04:47.655
What?

04:47.688 --> 04:49.156
I'm getting a motorcycle.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.057
No way.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.725
Uh-huh.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.127
Mom and Dad are going
to let you have a bike?

04:54.161 --> 04:57.164
It's not a matter of
letting me have it, Darlene.

04:57.197 --> 05:01.902
It's a matter of women being
exploited by men for centuries.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.236
ROSEANNE: I don't
believe you, Dan.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.272
You're still, like,
living in the '50s.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.342
Oh, go on, risk your
child's life just to spite me.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.677
I don't need your permission.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.484
Mom, I'm really sorry you had
to have that fight with Dad.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.385
It's, OK.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.218
I won.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.456
Well, I guess I shouldn't
pick up the scooter

05:22.490 --> 05:23.524
for a couple of days, huh?

05:23.557 --> 05:26.026
You know, let dad
get used to the idea.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.227
You're not getting any bike.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.265
Well, you were
just saying that--

05:32.299 --> 05:35.268
Forget what I said,
they're dangerous.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.203
Oh, for a girl.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.471
Is that it?

05:37.505 --> 05:40.441
If--if DJ was 17, and he
wanted a bike, you'd let him.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.242
No, I would not.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.244
But I would let Darlene,
so figure that one out.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.718
You know, you're
worse than Dad.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.753
Because you're a woman and
you should know better.

05:52.786 --> 05:56.156
Hey, Becky, if you want a car
then you can just go get a job

05:56.189 --> 05:59.927
and buy yourself a car, but
you're not getting a bike!

05:59.960 --> 06:02.596
And you, what is it with you?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.031
All you do is just
lay here on the couch

06:04.064 --> 06:05.966
staring at that stupid TV!

06:05.999 --> 06:07.668
One dumb rerun after another.

06:10.538 --> 06:14.207
And I do it as
well as any man.

JACKIE: Sorry I am late.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.424
Sorry.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.993
I got tied up at
trucking school.

06:33.026 --> 06:38.098
I am really enjoying it, and my
teacher told me that he thought

06:38.131 --> 06:39.132
I was doing really good.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.801
Only he's not sure
that I can handle

06:40.834 --> 06:43.837
the solitude that a trucker's
got to live with, right?

06:43.871 --> 06:49.510
So he dares me to sit in one of
the rigs for three hours alone.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.211
No one to talk to.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.179
No one's talking to me.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.417
For three hours.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.719
Alone.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.053
And I did it.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.022
And I feel great.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.156
Hip hip hooray, huh?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.060
Hello?

07:12.666 --> 07:16.303
You guys, you're just
screwing with me, right?

07:16.336 --> 07:20.207
We have had a fight, and we're
not speaking to each other.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.175
Oh.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.611
Well, what was the fight about?

07:23.644 --> 07:24.578
Maybe I can take a side.

07:35.856 --> 07:40.427
DJ, what did you
do in school today?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.629
Nothing.

07:41.662 --> 07:45.298
Oh, well, that must have
been really fun for you.

07:50.738 --> 07:54.341
Becky, you gonna, uh, you
gonna run for student council

07:54.374 --> 07:55.709
again this year?

07:55.743 --> 07:56.610
Oh, I can't.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.512
I got to get a job.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.413
Sure, student council would
help me get into college.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.281
But hey, who needs a future?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.786
Good.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.589
Good.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.725
Darlene, how's that first year
of high school treating you?

08:11.759 --> 08:12.860
Oh, don't drag me into this.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.130
You answer her, Darlene.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.398
Why?

08:18.431 --> 08:22.570
Because if you don't, she
will come after me next.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.605
High school is very
educational, Aunt Jackie.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.773
Did you make the
basketball team?

08:25.806 --> 08:27.274
Course she made it.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.742
I didn't make first string.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.744
Give it time, you're
only a freshman.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.479
When's your first game?

08:32.512 --> 08:33.647
I don't know.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.948
What do you mean
you don't know?

08:34.982 --> 08:38.218
I mean I don't know.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.052
I quit the team.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.391
What are you talking about?

08:44.424 --> 08:47.828
I am no longer on
the basketball team.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.863
You didn't talk to me first?

08:49.897 --> 08:52.766
Well, it's my
decision, isn't it?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.134
What happened?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.103
You didn't make first string,
so you're just bailing out?

08:56.136 --> 08:57.671
Look, I got other stuff to do.

08:57.705 --> 08:58.872
What other stuff?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.407
Hey, it's not like it
was going to be my career.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.409
Stop putting this
jock label on me.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.711
See, there you go again, Dan.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.145
You're doing it again.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.546
Oh, God, here we go.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.548
Roseanne, this has nothing to
do with Becky, or the scooter,

09:08.582 --> 09:10.417
or with women's lib.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.587
Oh, it's just so easy
for you isn't it, Dan?

09:13.621 --> 09:15.122
Darlene is the jock.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.824
And Becky's the brain.

09:16.857 --> 09:17.891
What am I?

09:17.925 --> 09:18.726
We don't know yet.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.697
Darlene's got a lot
of talent, Roseanne.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.066
She doesn't want to be
your little jock, Dan.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.936
So stop using her to fulfill
some of your fantasies

09:28.969 --> 09:31.104
about being some great
girl basketball player.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.342
Fine.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.476
Darlene, you want
to be a quitter?

09:36.509 --> 09:37.377
Be a quitter.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.679
I give up.

09:38.712 --> 09:39.512
Quitter!

09:47.054 --> 09:49.056
You know, I thought that was
a really good point you made

09:49.089 --> 09:50.590
about--
- Shut up, Jackie.

09:50.624 --> 09:53.994
[music playing]

09:59.066 --> 10:01.434
Mother, there are
absolutely no jobs out there

10:01.468 --> 10:03.036
that are right for me.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.238
I mean, I need something that
will leave me time to study

10:05.272 --> 10:06.807
and help around the house.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.242
I mean, you know, what if
you really need me here

10:09.276 --> 10:11.444
and I'm off at some stupid job?

10:11.478 --> 10:12.579
You know you're right, Becky.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.281
You should just forget
about the stupid job.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.482
Because you know what?

10:15.515 --> 10:17.651
Your father and I have
decided that we're

10:17.685 --> 10:21.388
just going to get you your
very own little convertible.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.289
Really?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.556
Yes.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.558
And you are going to be
able to drive it right up

to your palatial
four bedroom condo

It's Marcy.

10:48.782 --> 10:49.649
What she want?

10:49.683 --> 10:50.918
I know what she--

10:50.951 --> 10:52.419
she wants you to
pick up the phone.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.225
How'd that kitten
get so damn rude?

10:58.258 --> 10:59.259
She must get it from Dad.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.097
Hello?

11:04.131 --> 11:06.666
Oh, nothing.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.035
No.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.337
OK, bye.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.173
Well, gee Darlene, I wish you
could open up to me like that.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.544
What'd Marcy want?

11:17.577 --> 11:18.545
Nothing.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.914
Well, she called for nothing?

11:20.948 --> 11:22.049
She wanted to do something.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.350
I didn't feel like it.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.286
Yeah, well, so what
are you going to do?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.756
Nothing.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.490
That's what you
did last weekend.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.658
Yeah, well, I'm not finished.

11:36.063 --> 11:36.964
Come on, Darlene.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.065
It's a beautiful day.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.467
Why don't you go out
there and do something?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.969
I don't want to do something.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.771
Well, I want you to.
Now, go on.

11:43.804 --> 11:44.938
Go on.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.474
What should I do, mother?

11:47.507 --> 11:51.178
Well, OK, you need some
school clothes, right?

11:51.211 --> 11:54.214
I'm going to give you
my Rodbells charge card,

11:54.247 --> 11:55.715
and I want you go
down to the mall

11:55.749 --> 11:58.185
and pick yourself out something.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.019
What?

12:02.355 --> 12:03.423
I don't need the clothes, Mom.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.324
Here's the card.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.026
Just do it.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.194
What should I buy?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.428
I don't know.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.530
Go try to find something
to blend in with the couch.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.203
Oh, so that's the way
it works around here?

12:16.236 --> 12:20.841
You lie around like a hairball,
and you get free clothes?

12:20.874 --> 12:24.511
Maybe if I lapse into a
coma I'll get that car.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.915
[music playing]

12:29.516 --> 12:32.886
[music playing]

12:33.987 --> 12:35.122
Hi, here.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.156
Oh.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.257
Bye.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.193
Aren't-- aren't you
gonna say hi to Bonnie?

12:40.227 --> 12:41.261
Hello, Bonnie.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.230
Hi, Darlene.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.865
Let's see what you bought.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.967
OK, I'll miss the bus.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.536
Here, knock yourself out.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.604
OK, let's check it out here.

12:51.638 --> 12:52.472
OK.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.773
Wow.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.143
BONNIE: Wow.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.478
Mm-Hmm.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.348
Mmm.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.516
You didn't happen
to, uh, accidentally

13:03.550 --> 13:05.185
pick up Zorro's bag by mistake?

13:10.757 --> 13:13.193
Are you making some sort
of a statement here?

13:13.226 --> 13:14.995
No, I just like--

13:15.028 --> 13:16.263
What's the matter?

13:16.296 --> 13:17.797
Nothing, bye.

13:17.831 --> 13:18.899
No, you hang out a while.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.233
I'll give you a ride home.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.069
Well, how long
is it going to be?

13:22.102 --> 13:24.905
Leon, how much
longer till I'm off?

13:24.938 --> 13:28.241
Well, you're on the schedule
for one more hour, Roseanne.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.078
Oh, I'll just get my clothes.

13:31.111 --> 13:34.481
No, I'll walk.

13:34.514 --> 13:38.551
Boy, I wonder what's with her?

13:38.585 --> 13:41.221
She's been like this
for a couple weeks now.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.656
She just isn't into anything.

13:43.690 --> 13:44.992
You know what?

13:45.025 --> 13:48.795
Maybe she's having a hard
time adjusting to high school.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.497
Maybe, yeah, I don't know.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.266
Well, I don't know what
to tell you, Roseanne.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.435
Except, uh, if it's a boy.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.403
No.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.305
Because remember that Barry kid?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.140
Mm-hmm, Valentine's Day dance?

14:00.173 --> 14:03.243
Yeah, well, she's like really
mental over there for a while,

14:03.276 --> 14:04.611
right?

14:04.644 --> 14:06.279
So he drops by the other day
and she spends the whole time

14:06.313 --> 14:08.381
just watching TV and
totally ignoring him.

14:08.415 --> 14:12.319
I mean, OK, I used to watch
TV and ignore Dan, too.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.223
But only when we
were making out.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.824
What about her friends?

14:17.857 --> 14:21.428
What if she's hanging
around with a bad influence?

14:21.461 --> 14:25.665
No, Darlene always
was the bad influence.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.036
[music playing]

14:33.073 --> 14:35.442
[tv playing]

14:37.844 --> 14:38.645
Hey.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.849
You're watching basketball.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.684
Mm-hmm.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.718
Mind if I join you?

14:45.752 --> 14:46.553
Sure.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.891
I love preseason basketball.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.093
You get a chance
to watch guys that

14:53.126 --> 14:54.194
are going to be
on the next plane

14:54.227 --> 14:57.197
to the Italian league
in about 10 minutes.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.099
Oh, and he misses
the easy lay-up.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.433
Bonjourno.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.434
And look at this guy--

15:01.468 --> 15:03.070
Cut it out.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.204
What?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.073
I quit because I didn't
want to play, all right?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.307
I didn't say anything.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.109
Come on, Dad, just do it.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.010
Quitters never win.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.344
Winners never quit.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.546
I let go of that two
weeks ago, Darlene.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.447
Yeah, right.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.782
I did.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.217
Yeah, well then how come
you just sat down and started

15:17.250 --> 15:18.218
talking about basketball?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.953
It was on TV!

15:19.987 --> 15:20.920
No, that's not it.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.123
All we ever talk
about is basketball.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.792
No, any time I
try to talk to you

15:25.825 --> 15:29.029
about anything you turn it into
basketball and you run away.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.831
Face it, Dad, all we ever
used to do is talk about sports.

15:31.864 --> 15:32.732
Well I'm a big girl now--

15:32.765 --> 15:34.167
Right, right, and I label you.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.436
Well, that's crap.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.838
We used to talk
about everything.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.507
We could talk about anything.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.874
I still want to.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.010
Come on, pick a topic.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.177
I'll yak all night.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.213
Yeah, yak away just
leave me out of it.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.114
And there she goes.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.648
She's off!

15:48.681 --> 15:50.517
Around the couch
and up the stairs

15:50.550 --> 15:51.918
right into her
room, where she'll

15:51.951 --> 15:53.053
hide out like she always does.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.755
Well, let me tell you
something Little Missy,

15:55.788 --> 15:58.858
I don't need to stand here
and have you not talk to me!

15:58.891 --> 16:00.727
I got a wife and two other
kids that are perfectly

16:00.760 --> 16:03.463
happy not to talk to me!

16:03.496 --> 16:04.397
(WHISPERS) What?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.206
Where the hell have you been?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.174
What's with you?

16:14.207 --> 16:15.342
Darlene is turning
into a zombie,

16:15.375 --> 16:16.876
and you're doing nothing.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.412
I'm doing the best I can, Dan.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.214
And why is this about me?

16:21.248 --> 16:22.815
I didn't raise her alone, buddy.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.984
Yeah, well you let her do
whatever the hell she wants.

16:25.018 --> 16:28.321
If it was up to me Darling would
still be playing basketball.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.090
Basketball is not
her problem, Dan.

16:30.123 --> 16:30.990
I know that!

16:31.024 --> 16:31.958
You think I don't know that?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.660
What do you think I am, stupid?

16:33.693 --> 16:34.994
What are you
yelling at me for?

16:35.028 --> 16:36.329
Because I'm angry
and I need to yell,

16:36.363 --> 16:39.832
and you're standing in
front of me she's not!

16:39.866 --> 16:40.767
Huh, OK.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.335
Well, you keep yellin', honey.

16:42.369 --> 16:47.207
And then when it's my turn
to yell you just point at me.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.276
What are we going to do?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.411
Well, we'll just
talk to her calmly,

16:51.444 --> 16:57.150
and rationally, and
sensitively, until she cracks.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.551
Darlene!

16:58.585 --> 16:59.786
Nuh-uh, I already tried it.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.389
It's your turn.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.223
Darlene!

17:06.826 --> 17:07.694
What?

17:07.727 --> 17:08.595
Hi, honey.

17:08.628 --> 17:09.562
Sit down.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.131
Jeez, I just
did this with Dad.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.966
Oh right, like that
counts for anything.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.136
Here, sit down
and talk to mommy.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.970
Can we just get this
over with, please?

17:18.004 --> 17:22.142
OK, well, I'm really
worried about you, Darlene.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.677
You're, like,
withdrawn and distant

17:24.711 --> 17:27.747
and, uh, I just wondered
if there's anything

17:27.780 --> 17:29.716
that you want to talk about?

17:29.749 --> 17:31.418
No.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.352
Oh, come on, Darlene.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.620
Do you know how
impressed your dad

17:33.653 --> 17:35.122
would be if you'd tell me
what the problem is and I

17:35.155 --> 17:36.323
can fix it?

17:36.356 --> 17:39.092
Why is everyone so sure
that there's some problem?

17:39.126 --> 17:40.460
Well, because you
don't go any place.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.195
You don't do anything.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.796
You know, at least when
you had basketball--

17:43.830 --> 17:45.765
Basketball, here we go again.

17:45.798 --> 17:46.999
Oh, come on, Darlene.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.067
Come on back.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.303
I'm not telling you
to play basketball.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.872
I think it's about the stupidest
sport in the world, anyway.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.175
And I spent all four
years of high school

17:55.208 --> 17:57.777
pretending like I had cramps
so I didn't have to play it.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.680
But, I don't know, it seemed
like when you had basketball

18:00.713 --> 18:01.814
you cared about something.

18:01.848 --> 18:02.749
You know?

18:02.782 --> 18:04.451
What do you care about now?

18:04.484 --> 18:05.918
I care about being left alone.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.623
Are you doing drugs, Darlene?

18:10.657 --> 18:12.058
No!

18:12.091 --> 18:14.361
Would you tell me if you were?

18:14.394 --> 18:15.728
If I was, no, I
wouldn't tell you.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.831
But since I'm not,
the answer is no.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.300
Why should I believe you?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.068
Because I'm saying it.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.069
You can search my room.

18:23.102 --> 18:23.970
Give me a blood test.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.438
Do whatever you want.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.874
So, what is it, Darlene?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.409
Is it school?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.310
It's school.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.211
It's my friends.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.345
It's the way I look.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.246
It's you.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.147
It's dad.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.882
It's everything.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.518
Well, OK.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.253
I mean, I can really
relate to that.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.021
Because, you know, when I was--
- Please, Mom.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.523
- --your age.
- I don't want you to help me.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.825
I just want you
to leave me alone.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.695
Please.

18:48.728 --> 18:52.064
[music playing]

19:01.441 --> 19:04.244
God, what did you
do to the meatloaf?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.812
Well, I guess I burned it.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.280
Didn't I?

19:07.314 --> 19:09.282
But you can scrape
off the outside

19:09.316 --> 19:11.518
and still eat the inside.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.852
I don't like it.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.754
You didn't even taste it.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.923
I want peanut
butter and jelly.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.958
Hey, I'm not a restaurant, OK?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.093
You eat what I cook or
you don't eat at all.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.031
Jeez.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.471
[tapping plate]

19:42.449 --> 19:43.550
I want peanut
butter and jelly.

19:48.555 --> 19:52.392
Uh, I'm gonna go see if
Darlene wants to come down.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.394
I really should talk to her.

19:54.427 --> 19:58.998
Dan, just leave her alone.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.402
[music playing]

20:10.377 --> 20:13.746
[tv playing]

20:37.704 --> 20:41.073
[sighs]
