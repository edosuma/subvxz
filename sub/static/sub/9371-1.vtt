00:38.955 --> 00:47.087
Let the gates be opened.
Let me see and let me hear.

00:47.297 --> 00:51.633
Let my inmost being speak.

00:51.843 --> 00:59.433
Let my force, my hand, be filled
with strength, courage, hope.

00:59.642 --> 01:03.270
Hear me, show me.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.024
Your servant is calling.

01:07.233 --> 01:12.029
Your servant is listening respectfully.

01:12.238 --> 01:19.369
Let the gates be opened
in heaven and on earth.

02:13.174 --> 02:17.886
PRESENT TIME

03:26.748 --> 03:32.211
I'm alright. I've been busy
with moving and things.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.339
I've hardly had time
to think about the idiot.

03:35.548 --> 03:42.804
I'm starting to get back on my feet
again. Yes, me too, it's been ages.

03:43.014 --> 03:48.018
That's okay, just come when you can.
I'm on my way there now.

03:48.228 --> 03:53.774
Yes, I won't have time to go shopping
before you come. Love you, bye!

06:21.547 --> 06:26.426
You have one new message.

06:26.636 --> 06:31.098
Hi, it's me. I just wanted to check
if everything's okay.

06:39.899 --> 06:46.029
Listen, don't ever call me again!
I want nothing more to do with you.

06:46.239 --> 06:52.119
You're not interested in knowing how
I feel, you only care about yourself!

06:52.328 --> 06:56.998
Don't ever call again,
you're the one who left us!

07:33.911 --> 07:36.580
Hello?

09:24.355 --> 09:28.525
- You must be the new tenant?
- Yes.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.946
- Ullman. Elsa.
- Caroline. Menard.

09:33.155 --> 09:36.241
- I just wanted to welcome you.
- Thank you!

09:36.450 --> 09:42.789
That's how we do it here. Not so
many people move into this building.

09:45.376 --> 09:49.129
- I hope you'll both enjoy living here.
- It's only me.

09:49.338 --> 09:56.303
- Oh, I'm sorry, I just assumed...
- That's alright.

09:56.512 --> 10:00.432
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise!

10:04.103 --> 10:10.233
Perhaps you should put your name on the
door. The landlord isn't very reliable.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.279
Yes. Thank you!

12:33.544 --> 12:36.463
Where did you get those?

12:39.383 --> 12:46.556
- You must have left them in the lock.
- I see. Okay.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.977
Steiner.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.357
Johan Steiner.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.278
- I live right above you.
- Okay.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.367
That's good.

13:06.577 --> 13:09.704
I think you should leave now.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.500
Thank you.

15:08.032 --> 15:14.871
- I'm terribly sorry, I didn't see.
- That's alright, I didn't see either.

15:15.080 --> 15:19.417
But then I haven't done so
for the last two decades.

15:20.419 --> 15:25.423
I'm Frank Mandel
and this little furry friend is Udo.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.761
He doesn't bite, unless I ask him to.

15:29.970 --> 15:35.141
Caroline...Menard.
I just moved in here.

15:35.351 --> 15:40.313
You must be living in Vera Brandt's
old flat on the sixth floor then?

15:40.522 --> 15:43.066
Yes, I suppose so.

15:43.275 --> 15:48.905
- And you have a little child too?
- No. No husband, no children.

15:49.114 --> 15:53.660
- Pardon me, I just assumed...
- That's alright.

15:53.869 --> 15:57.705
- I have to get on here.
- Of course.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.083
Come on, Udo!

16:38.497 --> 16:41.290
Dammit... Ouch!

17:07.233 --> 17:10.028
Oh, what the...

19:48.145 --> 19:52.982
Hello! Mario's was closed
so I went with Lamberto's instead.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.570
- Was that okay?
- Just what I need.

19:57.779 --> 20:01.115
I bought Funghi as usual.

20:05.913 --> 20:10.666
- Have you been crying?
- I'm just feeling a bit pathetic.

20:10.876 --> 20:15.463
Sweetie...
That's the last thing you are.

20:15.672 --> 20:21.219
You're one of the strongest, toughest
women I know. If not the strongest.

20:21.428 --> 20:26.807
- Right now I just feel so...lonely.
- But you have so many around you.

20:27.017 --> 20:31.312
Sure, people who like, add,
hashtag and do thumbs up.

20:31.521 --> 20:38.319
- But no-one who really cares. But you.
- That's certainly not too bad, is it?

20:38.528 --> 20:41.405
No, you're the best.

20:49.331 --> 20:54.001
You must be joking!
Will the furniture come later?

20:54.211 --> 21:01.217
- No.
- That sucks. He kept it all, did he?

21:01.426 --> 21:04.804
Can we eat out of the carton?
I'm a bit short on plates.

21:05.013 --> 21:08.975
Sure. If you have scissors,
we can skip the cutlery too.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.353
Perfect!

21:12.562 --> 21:17.149
- For you.
- Oh... Thank you!

21:17.359 --> 21:23.322
- I don't know if I should drink...
- Liquid courage is just what you need.

21:24.366 --> 21:30.121
- Let's sit down in the sofa.
- You have a sofa. Congratulations!

21:31.999 --> 21:35.126
Yes, you're probably right.

21:35.335 --> 21:38.546
- It's been so long since I met Linda.
- Yes.

21:38.755 --> 21:43.217
She thought we were sisters. Remember
the drawings she made in pre-school?

21:43.427 --> 21:49.098
She drew a huge nose on me
and enormous, green, curly hair.

21:49.308 --> 21:54.437
I know I saved that drawing,
it must be lying somewhere at home.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.400
Hungry?

22:00.819 --> 22:05.406
That's enough for me.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.576
- Look into the camera.
- Alright.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.165
Like this?

22:19.713 --> 22:25.926
- Look how strange this turned out.
- That's exactly how I feel.

22:26.136 --> 22:32.266
All blurry. It's as if
I'm breaking up from the inside.

22:32.476 --> 22:37.688
I feel so small
and lonesome and lost that I...

22:37.898 --> 22:45.196
What a crappy year!
First it was mum and now all this.

22:45.405 --> 22:50.618
At least you can be glad you're rid of
"he-who-must-not-be-named".

22:50.827 --> 22:56.374
Yes. Although this wasn't exactly how I
thought everything would turn out.

22:56.583 --> 23:01.295
- But then things seldom are.
- No.

23:01.505 --> 23:07.301
I imagine my life like a jigsaw puzzle.
Some pieces don't fit together -

23:07.511 --> 23:11.764
- some are badly constructed
and some are missing.

23:11.973 --> 23:15.476
Whatever I do
the puzzle is never completed.

23:15.685 --> 23:22.358
Maybe some pieces came from another
jigsaw puzzle and ended up in your box.

23:22.567 --> 23:28.239
- That would explain "you-know-who".
- Defective life! I want a full refund.

23:28.448 --> 23:33.411
- And start over again?
- No, I wouldn't have the energy.

23:33.620 --> 23:38.791
That's the worst part. I'm too old.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.213
- Oh, stop it. Too old for what?
- For a second chance.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.216
To start a family.

23:57.102 --> 24:02.731
It's just important that you don't hide
in the dark and get stuck in the past.

24:02.941 --> 24:06.944
You should try to accept
what's happened and move on.

24:07.154 --> 24:11.157
I know that you mean well
and I love you for it, really I do.

24:11.366 --> 24:17.163
But I can't bare to talk more about
it now. I just want to forget it all.

24:19.666 --> 24:26.589
And that's why, on the sixth day,
God created alcohol. Cheers!

24:26.798 --> 24:29.550
You're probably right.

24:33.138 --> 24:38.350
Whoops! Good thing
I'm doing my laundry tomorrow.

24:38.560 --> 24:43.230
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- The light switch is inside.

24:50.947 --> 24:55.910
It's so nice to be here,
it's been so busy at work.

24:56.119 --> 25:02.875
Did I tell you that we looked at a
house outside town with a pool and all?

25:03.084 --> 25:05.961
Linda will love it,
she'll be so surprised.

25:06.171 --> 25:10.174
It's just the kind of house
we dreamed of when we were little.

25:10.383 --> 25:15.846
We were going to get married,
meet prince Charming and...

25:20.393 --> 25:24.146
Have they replaced
the plumbing here yet?

25:24.356 --> 25:28.943
Plumbing, neighbours...
All is not perfect in this building.

25:29.152 --> 25:33.322
It'll be fine. You just moved in,
everything will work out.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.367
Sure...

25:38.036 --> 25:45.334
I really have to get going now. Linda
has swimming practice in the morning.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.170
That's alright.

25:57.305 --> 26:02.893
- You know I'd have stayed if I could.
- Yes, I know.

26:03.103 --> 26:07.815
I made a spare set of keys.
I'd feel safe if you'd keep them.

26:08.024 --> 26:13.195
Of course I will.
And my phone. Thank you.

26:16.366 --> 26:21.245
- Are you feeling alright now?
- Yes, I'm alright.

26:23.582 --> 26:28.168
Sleep well. Make yourself
a cup of tea and then go to bed.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.380
It'll get better.

26:34.342 --> 26:39.138
- Love you! Thanks for this evening!
- Bye bye!

28:57.569 --> 29:00.863
Oh, dammit!

30:38.294 --> 30:40.921
You shouldn't be here.

33:27.380 --> 33:34.052
Hello, it's Caroline. I can't answer
right now, please leave a message.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.848
Eva from the psychiatric clinic
again. You missed your appointment -

33:38.057 --> 33:43.437
- so please call the reception
and book a new one.

34:59.305 --> 35:02.974
Unlucky in love,
lucky in laundry booking.

35:03.184 --> 35:06.269
That's always something.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.163
- Hello!
- Hello.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.213
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

36:15.423 --> 36:19.759
It was completely my fault.
I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

36:19.969 --> 36:25.056
How are you getting on, dear?
Are you settling in?

36:25.266 --> 36:27.767
I suppose so.

36:27.977 --> 36:33.356
I don't feel quite at home yet,
but I'm sure I'll like it here.

36:38.529 --> 36:41.573
Well...

36:42.783 --> 36:50.665
Of course it always takes a bit getting
used to new sounds and smells...

36:50.875 --> 36:53.793
Of course it does. Always.

36:54.003 --> 36:59.299
Personally, I don't think I could ever
get used to a flat like yours.

36:59.508 --> 37:05.722
- Is that so?
- Considering the tragic occurrences.

37:05.932 --> 37:12.103
- I don't quite understand.
- Although they happened in the '80s.

37:13.314 --> 37:18.151
Don't you worry about that, dear,
I'm just a superstitious old fool.

37:19.153 --> 37:25.367
Well, clean the filter if you use
the dryer, and here is my set of rules.

37:25.576 --> 37:29.871
- Of course.
- Goodbye.

38:27.763 --> 38:30.056
Hello?

38:30.850 --> 38:33.685
Hello...?

38:51.370 --> 38:54.956
- Hello!
- You startled me!

38:55.166 --> 38:58.251
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

38:58.461 --> 39:04.132
- I'm Caroline, I just moved in here.
- I know, I saw the sign on the door.

39:04.342 --> 39:08.970
- It was coming off so I put it back.
- How kind. Thank you!

39:09.180 --> 39:14.559
- My name is My. I can help you.
- Okay.

39:32.661 --> 39:36.373
Put the clothes in the...

39:40.795 --> 39:45.298
- You have very nice clothes!
- Do you think so?

39:45.508 --> 39:47.592
Thank you!

39:57.645 --> 40:00.897
- Will you live here now?
- That's the idea.

40:01.107 --> 40:04.150
- Good!
- Yes, isn't it?

40:04.360 --> 40:08.113
Have you built a little den?

40:08.322 --> 40:11.991
Yes, one would imagine so.

40:12.201 --> 40:16.746
There's the kitchen, here's the office
and there's the ice cream stand.

40:16.956 --> 40:21.209
That's nice.
Why don't you have any children?

40:24.004 --> 40:26.923
- It just didn't happen.
- Don't you want any?

40:27.133 --> 40:29.759
Yes, but...

40:31.220 --> 40:34.973
But you do have the toys.

41:23.898 --> 41:27.358
What's this?

41:27.568 --> 41:32.280
Is it yours? Where did you buy it?

41:32.490 --> 41:38.077
- It was given to me by a guy.
- That was kind.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.122
- Why don't you wear it?
- We're not together now.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.877
- Why not?
- Because...

41:46.086 --> 41:51.674
- Have you never been in love?
- Yes, but that was ages ago.

41:51.884 --> 41:56.262
- I bet it was hundreds of years ago.
- Yes, actually.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.973
Okay...

42:16.951 --> 42:22.539
I don't know if this is supposed to be
an item of clothing or something torn.

42:22.748 --> 42:26.834
Whatever it is, it's yours,
I found it in the dryer.

42:27.044 --> 42:32.840
However, I noticed that you
cleaned the filter. We do like that.

42:33.884 --> 42:39.806
- That's good.
- Indeed. Goodbye.

42:53.195 --> 42:55.822
My?

42:57.199 --> 43:02.996
- Why are you standing there, darling?
- I'm sorry, I thought it was her.

43:03.205 --> 43:06.291
- Who?
- My grandma.

43:06.500 --> 43:12.714
Can't I stay here with you
for a while longer? I can help you.

43:12.923 --> 43:15.133
Of course you can.

43:15.342 --> 43:19.137
But sooner or later
you have to go home. Or to Grandma.

43:19.346 --> 43:22.807
She'll worry otherwise
and wonder where you are.

43:23.017 --> 43:27.645
- It's as if I don't exist to her.
- Surely that's not true.

43:27.855 --> 43:33.484
- I see you.
- I know.

43:36.363 --> 43:40.408
Do you know what?
I have the perfect job for us.

43:54.173 --> 43:57.342
- Where are we going?
- To the attic.

43:57.551 --> 44:02.138
- I don't want to go there.
- Why not?

44:02.348 --> 44:05.475
My, wait!

46:19.985 --> 46:23.571
Come on, Udo. That's enough.

47:20.504 --> 47:25.216
And here comes miss Menard, I believe.
Isn't that right?

47:25.425 --> 47:29.846
- How did you know?
- That special gait.

47:30.055 --> 47:36.477
You put your left foot down while your
right drags slightly. Very distinctive.

47:36.687 --> 47:40.273
And, of course,
there's the perfume. I like it.

47:40.482 --> 47:44.861
Thank you! Or I mean...

47:45.070 --> 47:50.199
By the way, do you happen to know
whom the little girl is visiting?

47:50.409 --> 47:55.413
- A little girl, you say? How old?
- Seven or eight, I should think.

47:55.622 --> 47:58.416
She says she's visiting
her grandmother.

47:58.625 --> 48:03.754
I don't believe we have any
grandmothers in the whole building.

48:03.964 --> 48:09.760
- But we do have quite a few ghosts.
- Yes, right.

48:16.810 --> 48:20.271
Come on, Udo, let's go!

50:05.252 --> 50:07.628
- You've reached Emma...
- ...Pontus...

50:07.838 --> 50:10.631
- ...and Linda.
- We can't take your call...

50:10.841 --> 50:15.428
- ...but speak after the beep.
- Bye bye!

50:15.637 --> 50:21.600
Hello, Emma, it's me.
I just needed someone to talk to.

50:23.687 --> 50:28.399
I feel a bit lonely.
I know you have lots to do, but...

50:30.402 --> 50:33.404
I don't know, but it feels as if...

50:35.323 --> 50:39.535
Please call when you have the time.
Love you!

51:33.215 --> 51:35.549
Hello...?

51:37.677 --> 51:40.304
Hello?

58:30.048 --> 58:32.591
Does it hurt?

58:32.800 --> 58:37.054
Where did you come from?
You can't just turn up like this.

58:38.806 --> 58:42.976
- You have to go home now.
- But I am home.

58:44.479 --> 58:48.357
Oh dear, whatever
is the matter with you?

58:48.566 --> 58:55.197
Does this by any chance
happen to be your grandchild?

58:55.406 --> 58:59.743
- I beg your pardon?
- Isn't My here your grandchild?

58:59.953 --> 59:04.706
I have neither children
nor grandchildren.

59:06.668 --> 59:14.049
- But...
- Are you really feeling quite well?

59:15.468 --> 59:20.055
I think I need to
go and lie down for a while.

59:25.520 --> 59:28.230
My?

59:32.777 --> 59:36.989
- My?
- Please don't be angry with me.

59:37.198 --> 59:42.035
I'm not angry, I just need to try
to understand what's happening.

59:42.245 --> 59:48.333
I said I live here. I've lived here all
along, since long before you moved in.

59:55.550 --> 59:58.677
Let's take this
from the beginning, shall we?

59:59.554 --> 01:00:02.264
Who are you?

01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:09.313
My mum died when I was born,
so I had to live with Grandma.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:38.175
Let me see and let me hear.
Let my inmost being speak.

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:41.762
Let my force, my hand -

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:46.558
- be filled with strength,
courage, hope.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:56.318
"- Shall we go home to mum?"
"- Yes, we can have biscuits there!"

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:04.493
Grandma, where are you?

01:01:04.702 --> 01:01:10.832
- Are you coming soon?
- Yes...

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:17.631
- I'm just going to...
- That's what Alfie Atkins said.

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:26.264
Let me see and let me hear.
Let my inmost being speak.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:31.395
Let my force, my hand,
be filled with strength, courage...

01:01:34.148 --> 01:01:41.321
Let my force, my hand,
be filled with strength and courage.

01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:45.409
Your faithful...

01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:50.372
Your faithful servant is calling you.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:20.360
- Everything will be fine.
- How do you mean?

01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:51.933
I think she blamed me
for my mum's death.

01:03:05.364 --> 01:03:09.201
I woke up and everything
was so different.

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:12.704
I felt like the loneliest
person in the whole world.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:37.455
Grandma couldn't
live with what she'd done.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:43.962
I suppose that's why
she hanged herself.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:58.268
But darling, nobody
gets happy when someone dies.

01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:04.316
- But why me?
- You seemed sad and lonely, like me.

01:05:04.525 --> 01:05:11.156
Don't you want to share you life with
someone? Why shouldn't we have that?

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:16.244
And you did say you wanted a child.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:20.665
That's the worst part. I'm too old.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:26.004
- Too old for what?
- A second chance. To start a family.

01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:30.383
I'm a child and I want a real mum.
I want you.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:35.055
- But this isn't for real.
- But you're real, Caroline.

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:39.768
That's why I need you
- so that I feel real.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:46.566
You wanted a change, you said so. And
I don't want to be alone here anymore.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:49.945
Nobody wants to be with me.

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:58.578
Nobody ever listens to me or does what
I want! I want her and I will take her!

01:06:01.415 --> 01:06:06.795
I don't care what you want! You never
listen to me, so I won't listen to you!

01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:11.049
I'm the one in charge down here!

01:06:15.429 --> 01:06:20.767
She's mine! Mine, mine, mine...!

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.186
What's going on?

01:07:53.652 --> 01:07:56.946
Wake up.

01:07:57.156 --> 01:08:01.201
You're my mum now, for real.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:10.752
It's alright, don't be afraid.
Everything's fine now.

01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:14.547
I just had to help you
a little bit on the way.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.759
Miss Menard?

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:08.268
Or...?

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:16.526
Frank?

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:39.591
Come on, Udo!

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:24.802
- Hello, Caroline?
- Hello?

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:30.099
Are you there? I got your message
and tried to call several times.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:33.561
- Carro?
- Hello?

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:39.275
Hello? I'm on my way over now.

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:18.564
Carro...? Hello?

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:14.370
She can't see you.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.708
- Emma?
- She can't hear you either.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.405
Hello, dear.
I'm not buying anything, thanks.

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:53.576
Hello. No, I'm friends with
Caroline in the flat below.

01:12:53.786 --> 01:13:00.375
Have you seen her? She's been gone
for a few days and I'm a bit worried.

01:13:00.584 --> 01:13:06.172
What? I thought that flat
had been empty for years, dear.

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:16.099
Wait a second! What did you say
that you were selling? Hello?

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:20.223
We have each other now. Forever.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.561
Mum...?

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:47.500
Everything will be alright.

01:18:31.164 --> 01:18:33.833
Hello? Ms Ullman speaking.

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:38.212
Hello, my name is Katarina. Is the
advertised flat still available?

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:43.551
Yes, it's available.
You can move in straight away, dear.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.555
Given that you meet our criteria.

01:18:47.764 --> 01:18:54.353
- I'm a sincere, single professional.
- Lovely. I'm sure it'll go very well.

01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:19.003
