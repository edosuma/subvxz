[Doc] Ready, set... go!

[gasps]

01:08.068 --> 01:09.027
[all cheering]

01:09.110 --> 01:10.528
Nice shot.
Whoo-hoo!

01:10.612 --> 01:11.446
Yes!

01:11.529 --> 01:12.822
Nice one, Hallie.

01:12.906 --> 01:13.907
Thanks, Doc.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.159
They used to call me
"The Mistress of Marbles,"

01:16.242 --> 01:17.660
and I still got it.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.039
You're next, Lambie.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.752
Hey, wasn't there
just a marble
right there?

01:25.835 --> 01:27.629
Yeah, I think so.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.297
It must be
a marble monster!

01:29.380 --> 01:30.381
What?

01:30.715 --> 01:32.592
Oh, come on, Chilly.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.928
I'm sure there's
an explanation for--

01:35.678 --> 01:36.971
Hmm?
[laughing]

01:37.639 --> 01:40.558
Oh! Marble monsters!
I knew it!

01:41.810 --> 01:44.062
[faint laughter]

01:44.562 --> 01:47.649
I think we've found
our marble monsters.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.693
Oh, look.
It's Penny and her babies.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.320
[all] Hi!

01:52.403 --> 01:55.865
[laughs] The babies want to
come over and say hi
to everyone.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.492
[all] Hi! Hi! Hi!

01:58.034 --> 01:59.536
[laughing]

01:59.619 --> 02:01.079
How cute!

02:01.287 --> 02:02.497
Aw.
Hi, babies.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.666
How are the babies doing?

02:05.041 --> 02:06.292
They're a handful,

02:06.376 --> 02:08.044
but I wouldn't
trade them for anything.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.838
I just love them
so much.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.381
Wanna hold them?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.508
I thought you'd
never ask.

02:13.591 --> 02:14.717
Aw.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.512
Oh, can I hold one, too?

02:17.595 --> 02:18.930
Oh, sure.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.223
Aw.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.934
So that must be Pip,

02:23.601 --> 02:24.727
Flip...
[giggles]

02:25.270 --> 02:26.271
...and Trip.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.355
Oh!

02:27.730 --> 02:29.023
[baby possums giggling]

02:30.150 --> 02:32.152
Flip, stay close,
pumpkin.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.364
[laughing]

02:37.991 --> 02:40.326
Uh, I've never played
with a baby before.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.870
I hope they like me.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.456
Hi. I'm Chilly.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.711
Chilly.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.171
Oh, that is the cutest
thing ever.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.214
Come here, little guy.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.593
Oh, these are the sweetest
baby possum cheeks

02:56.676 --> 02:58.261
I've ever squeezed.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.679
[smooches]

02:59.762 --> 03:00.805
Mmm.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.765
More.

03:03.099 --> 03:06.686
Oh, you are making me
one happy lamb.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.063
[baby] Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Oh, that tickles!

03:09.147 --> 03:10.732
Roar! [laughing]

03:11.107 --> 03:13.151
[both] Roar!

03:13.234 --> 03:15.028
Again. Again!

03:15.361 --> 03:18.489
Wow. You want another
dragon roar?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.617
Well, here's one
coming right up.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.202
Roar! [laughing]

03:23.286 --> 03:25.330
[all three] Roar!
[laughing]

03:27.248 --> 03:29.167
[yawn]

03:30.168 --> 03:31.294
[yawn]

03:31.711 --> 03:35.048
Oh, these sweeties
look as sleepy
as a sloth in the sun.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.468
They sure do,
because it's naptime.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.886
[all] Aw!

03:41.930 --> 03:43.181
[yawn]

03:43.264 --> 03:45.725
With three little ones
running around all day,

03:46.267 --> 03:47.977
I could use a nap, too.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.146
Let's go, babes.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.856
[laughter]

03:57.862 --> 04:00.073
Wow. They really
stick with you.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.908
Those are my babies.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.119
[grunts]

04:05.954 --> 04:06.913
[snoring]

04:09.332 --> 04:12.168
Those babies
are so adorable.

04:12.502 --> 04:16.505
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's make a painting for them.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.632
They'll love it.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.216
[all] Yeah!

04:19.634 --> 04:21.469
Oooh, I'll get
some pretty paint.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.930
And I'll get
some pretty brushes.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.391
Or regular brushes,
whichever I find.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.647
[Hallie] Oh!

04:32.730 --> 04:34.107
Looks great, guys.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.567
[Penny]
Oh, no! Help! Help!

04:36.985 --> 04:38.403
Penny! What's wrong?

04:38.486 --> 04:39.404
Pip is gone.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.323
When I woke up,
he wasn't stuck
to my back,

04:42.407 --> 04:43.866
and I don't
see him anywhere.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.286
Poppin' possums,
that's a problem.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.870
But don't worry,
sugar.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.038
We'll find him.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.416
He couldn't have
gotten very far.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.584
Huh? The door's open!

04:53.668 --> 04:55.712
[gasps]
He could've gotten
farther than we thought.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.839
[Penny] Oh, no.
My little Pip!

04:58.339 --> 05:00.675
We have to find him
before he gets lost.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.303
I'll stay here
in case he comes
back, Doc.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.679
Thanks, Hallie.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.764
You guys,
come help me look.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.229
Psst.

05:16.357 --> 05:18.401
Be really quiet.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.278
[loudly] Quiet! Got it!

05:20.361 --> 05:21.904
Oh, you mean now?

05:21.988 --> 05:24.115
You mean, like,
being quiet now. Oh.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.078
[Lambie]
Any sign of him?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.663
[Donny]
Doc, are you up there?

05:31.372 --> 05:33.124
[Doc] No time to run.
Go stuffed!

05:33.207 --> 05:34.167
Whatcha doing, Doc?

05:34.250 --> 05:37.628
Oh, I was just playing
with my stuffed animals.

05:37.712 --> 05:41.716
We were, uh...
having a parade.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.635
I just beat Dad
at checkers.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.345
Want to try
to beat me?

05:46.679 --> 05:49.015
Uh, sure,
in a little while, okay?

05:49.307 --> 05:51.768
Okay, but I'm ready
when you are.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.228
[Pip] Roar!

05:54.520 --> 05:57.315
Hey, listen!
I hear something.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.400
[laughing]

06:00.109 --> 06:02.737
There he is!
Pip, come here.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.905
[Chilly]
We're coming!

06:05.323 --> 06:06.324
Mom!

06:08.409 --> 06:10.495
Hmm. Were you
calling me?

06:10.578 --> 06:12.663
Oh. Uh, no.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.333
I was just playing
with my toys.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.126
[possum laughs]
What was that?

06:17.210 --> 06:21.547
Mom!
Uh... Lambie really
wants a cuddle.

06:21.923 --> 06:22.799
[giggles]

06:22.882 --> 06:25.301
Trust me,
she really does.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.179
Well, everyone needs
a cuddle now and then.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.680
Mm-mm.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.559
Whew.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.269
Doc, did you see
where Pip went?

06:35.353 --> 06:37.855
No, but he's gotta be nearby.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.903
[Chilly]
Pip, Pip, Pippers.
[Lambie] Pippers?

06:44.654 --> 06:45.655
Pip!

06:47.740 --> 06:48.741
Hmm.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.161
Stuffy, remember when you roared

06:52.245 --> 06:54.789
and the babies
all roared?
Yeah.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.250
Well,
maybe if you roar again,

06:57.333 --> 06:59.377
Pip will roar
and we can find him.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.753
Sure thing.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.213
[clears throat]

07:02.922 --> 07:04.423
Roar!

07:05.633 --> 07:06.843
[Pip, faintly] Roar.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.594
[gasps] I hear him!

07:08.678 --> 07:09.804
Do it again.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.014
Roar!

07:13.933 --> 07:16.102
Doc! Doc!

07:16.436 --> 07:18.229
Pip, there you are.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.733
We have to get you
back to your mom.
She's so worried.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.153
Oh...

07:26.612 --> 07:27.613
Oh...

07:28.281 --> 07:29.282
[gasp]

07:30.158 --> 07:31.367
[Hallie] Pacin' possums,

07:31.451 --> 07:33.202
tell me you found
that little pipsqueak.

07:34.662 --> 07:35.663
Hi!

07:35.746 --> 07:36.664
[all] Pip!

07:36.747 --> 07:38.291
Oh, Pip.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.667
[laughter]

07:41.878 --> 07:42.920
[cooing]

07:43.379 --> 07:45.423
Oh, I was so worried
about you.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.550
You can't run off
like that.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.386
You're supposed to
stick to me.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.722
They are supposed to
stick with you...

07:53.514 --> 07:56.058
so how did Pip
get off your back?

07:56.350 --> 07:57.435
I don't know.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.604
They've never
fallen off before.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.231
Maybe there's a problem
with your back.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.858
What if it happens
again?

08:03.941 --> 08:05.193
Don't worry,
sweet mama.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.028
We'll make sure it doesn't.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.197
Yeah. We should
give you a checkup

08:09.280 --> 08:10.490
to see if something's wrong.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.326

Penny, it looks like
you're missing
one of the patches

08:44.857 --> 08:47.735
that holds your babies
onto your back.
Really?

08:48.110 --> 08:50.029
That's why Pip
wasn't stuck to you

08:50.112 --> 08:51.489
and why he
wandered off.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.575
[all chattering]

08:54.825 --> 08:56.953
Penny, I have a diagnosis.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.539
You have Nostick-olepsy.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.500
It means you're missing
one of the sticky parts

09:02.583 --> 09:04.377
that keeps your babies
close to you.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.295
Well, what can we
do about it?

09:06.671 --> 09:07.880
I have an idea.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.840
Hallie, the fabric
box, please.

[babies laughing]

09:15.137 --> 09:17.390
[uproarious laughing]

09:20.977 --> 09:22.603
Well, that looks like fun.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.230
Yes! [laughs]

09:24.313 --> 09:26.065
Yes, this is just
what we need.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.817
Hallie, the paste, please.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.235
All righty, Doc.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.862
Whoo whee.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.825
Let me see
your back, Penny.

09:43.666 --> 09:47.211
There. Now you little guys
should stay nice and close.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.214
Guys?
[Stuffy laughing]
Look at the fabric everywhere!

09:51.799 --> 09:52.675
Huh?

09:52.758 --> 09:54.510
[Doc] Stuffy, are
the babies with you?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.762
Huh? Oh, hmm.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.431
Uh, no,

09:58.514 --> 10:00.182
but they were here
a minute ago.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.435
Uh-oh. Missing possum alert.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.478
Aah! That hat is alive!

10:04.562 --> 10:06.731
Monster hat!
Monster hat!

10:06.814 --> 10:08.524
[Doc] I don't
think so, Chilly.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.068
[laughing]

10:12.403 --> 10:14.071
You wandered off again.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.159
You know, Penny, that patch
isn't always gonna keep
your babies

10:18.242 --> 10:19.368
from wandering away.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.454
They won't always
be attached to you.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.663
What do we do?

10:22.955 --> 10:25.583
One time, I went
to the shoe store with my mom,

10:25.666 --> 10:27.293
and I wandered
away from her.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.878
She found me
pretty fast,

10:28.961 --> 10:30.421
but we both
got scared.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.173
That does sound scary.

10:32.506 --> 10:35.134
She taught me
that it was important
to stay with her.

10:35.843 --> 10:36.886

Your paste should be
all dry, Penny.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.266
Let's try it out.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.185
Come here.
Come on, babies.

[grunting]

11:30.439 --> 11:32.149
[laughing]

11:34.985 --> 11:36.153
Yay!
They're sticking!

11:36.445 --> 11:38.155
[Stuffy] Doc,
you are so good.

11:38.447 --> 11:41.283
Penny, your Nostick-olepsy
is all cured.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.495
Those babies shouldn't wander
off again for a while.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.872
Oh, thank you
so much, Doc.

11:47.331 --> 11:48.666
You're welcome, Penny.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.710
Oh, and we have something
for the babies.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.009
[babies exclaiming]

12:00.094 --> 12:02.930
[Stuffy] I just have
one more thing to say.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.265
[clears throat]

12:04.682 --> 12:08.060
Roar! [laughing]

12:15.734 --> 12:17.153
[Doc reading]

12:19.071 --> 12:20.114
Oh, hi, Doc.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.366
Hi. What are
you guys doing?

12:22.450 --> 12:23.909
We're having
a yard sale.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.787
We're getting rid of
a bunch of old stuff
we don't need anymore.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.708
Alma, let's take one
more look in the closets,
see if we missed anything.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.626
Gotta go. Bye, Doc.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.879
Oh, you can look at
what we're selling.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.213
If you see anything
you want,

12:36.297 --> 12:37.548
you can totally
have it.

12:37.882 --> 12:38.883
Thanks.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.472
Hi, Doc.
Hi, Doc.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.848
Hi, guys.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.267
Oh. What is
all this stuff?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.187
Yeah. It almost looks
like it's a yard sale.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.732
Wait. It is a yard sale!

12:54.815 --> 12:57.151
Where kids sell the toys
they don't want anymore?

12:57.902 --> 12:59.570
Doc, you're not gonna...

12:59.653 --> 13:01.906
No, no. I'm not selling you.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.532
It's Emmie and Alma's yard sale.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.368
Whew.
Well, in that case,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.954
we should totally get this
wall-mounted singing turtle.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.122
It rocks!

13:10.748 --> 13:13.918
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Well, I'm a rockin' turtle</span>
<span style="style.default_1">That's what I am, thanks ♪</span>

13:14.001 --> 13:17.004
[giggles] Yeah.
I don't think so.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.422
[muffled]
Hello?

13:18.923 --> 13:20.049
Did you hear that?

13:20.633 --> 13:21.675
[muffled]
Hello.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.677
I think there's
a toy calling us.

13:23.761 --> 13:24.637
[muffled]
Hello?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.639
Oh, uh, this one!

13:28.057 --> 13:30.851
Well, I'm going in after her.
[shouts]

13:33.354 --> 13:34.772
Oh. Found her.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.816
[giggles] Hi.
I'm Doc McStuffins,

13:37.900 --> 13:40.694
and this is Lambie,
and you've met Stuffy.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.364
Nice to meet you.
My name is Pickles.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.657
Hi, Pickles.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.284
Pickles? Isn't that
a funny name for a bunny?

13:47.368 --> 13:51.497
Yeah, but Alma loved pickles
when she was little.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.790
That's when she got me.

13:52.873 --> 13:56.293
So she called me Pickles
because she loved me, too.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.920
We know Alma.

13:58.003 --> 14:02.132
You do? Oh, don't
you just love her?

14:02.216 --> 14:04.426
I do. She's my gal.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.427
[giggles]

14:05.511 --> 14:06.804
What is this place?

14:07.596 --> 14:10.015
[gasp] Is this a yard sale?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.518
It is, but don't worry.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.521
Don't worry?
I'm in a yard sale.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.148
They're...
getting rid of me!

14:18.232 --> 14:20.901
This is the only home
I've ever had.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.570
I don't want to leave it.

14:22.653 --> 14:27.241
I love Alma, and I thought
she loved me.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.034
I'm sure she loves you.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.370
I thought she'd
keep me forever.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.789
Now she's just
tossing me away?

14:34.206 --> 14:36.333
Oh, why would
she do that?

14:36.625 --> 14:38.210
I don't know.

14:38.544 --> 14:42.631
I guess there must
be something wrong with me.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.593
Oh, that's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

14:46.093 --> 14:50.180
I'm not sure who needs
this cuddle more, you or me.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.935
I think it's me.
[crying]

14:56.145 --> 14:58.522
Pickles, why don't you
come back to my clinic,

14:58.606 --> 15:00.065
and I'll give you
a checkup,

15:00.149 --> 15:02.735
see if I can find
anything wrong with you.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.320
That's okay, Doc.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.071
If Alma doesn't
want me anymore,

15:06.405 --> 15:09.366
I'll just pack up
a few things
and be on my way.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.535
But who's gonna
take care of you?

15:11.952 --> 15:13.454
I'll take care
of myself.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.624
That way, no kid
will ever break
my heart again.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.420
Oh, I'm gonna miss her.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.464
Why don't you
come stay with us?

15:23.547 --> 15:25.507
I'd love to have you
as a toy.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.927
Thanks, Doc,
but I was loved,

15:28.010 --> 15:29.470
and look where
it got me.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.764
I ended up
in a cardboard box

15:31.847 --> 15:34.183
with a tag that says
I'm for sale for...

15:35.976 --> 15:37.144
Twenty-five cents.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.147
Twenty-five cents!
That's all?

15:40.522 --> 15:43.484
[huffs] Nice to meet you.
Bye-bye.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.243
[Doc] Pickles, come back!

15:53.702 --> 15:55.371
[Lambie] Maybe we should
talk to her,

15:55.454 --> 15:57.873
stuffed animal
to stuffed animal.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.917
Sounds like a good idea.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.087
I'm counting on you guys
to bring her to the clinic.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.338
I'll be waiting.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.799
[Stuffy] You can trust us
to do the job, Doc.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.092
Come on, Lambie.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.718
[shouting]

16:10.552 --> 16:11.595
[giggles]

16:13.472 --> 16:15.391
I realize
it's hard to trust

16:15.474 --> 16:17.184
a dragon with
a can on his head,

16:17.267 --> 16:19.269
but we'll bring
Pickles back,

16:19.353 --> 16:20.729
no matter what.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.939
Thanks, Lambie.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.899
[chuckles] Sorry.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.693
You, too, Stuffy.

16:30.864 --> 16:31.699
[Stuffy] Pickles!

16:31.782 --> 16:32.783
Pickles, wait!

16:33.242 --> 16:34.785
We want to talk to you.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.203
[grunting]

16:38.580 --> 16:39.748
[Lambie] Oh, come on.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.750
[Stuffy] Here.
Let me give you a hand...

16:42.209 --> 16:43.419
And a tail.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.630
Stuffy, we don't want her
to climb the fence,

16:46.714 --> 16:47.631
remember?

16:47.881 --> 16:50.175
[gasps] Oh, yeah.
[grunts]

16:50.259 --> 16:51.677
Oops. Sorry, Pickles.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.680
It's okay, but you
can't change my mind.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.515
I'm heading off
on my own.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.852
Oh, Pickles, you need
friends right now.

17:00.144 --> 17:03.522
And Doc, she's
the greatest friend of all.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.190
But what if
she finds out

17:05.273 --> 17:06.942
there's something
wrong with me?

17:07.317 --> 17:09.069
Then she gets rid of me,

17:09.694 --> 17:11.238
just like Alma did.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.198
Doc would never do that.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.534
She loves us no matter what.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.536
That's what good friends do.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.913
Doc will love you, too.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.205
Come back with us.

17:21.623 --> 17:24.001
You guys would take me in?

17:24.417 --> 17:25.794
You bet we would.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.424
Hallie--
Hi!

17:30.716 --> 17:32.092
This is Pickles.

17:32.801 --> 17:35.929
[Hallie] Pickles,
Doc was telling me
all about you.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.183
You sure look like
you've seen a lot
of love in your day.

17:39.266 --> 17:42.186
[Pickles] It's true. I have.

17:42.269 --> 17:45.022
Doc, there's someone
here to see you.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.941
Thanks, Doc.
I should have known

17:48.025 --> 17:49.526
I couldn't get
the chicken pox.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.111
Only chickens get that.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.697
Oh, hi. I'm Chilly.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.158
This is Pickles.
She's Alma's toy.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.701
Alma put her in a

17:57.785 --> 17:58.827
[whispering]
yard sale.

17:58.911 --> 18:03.082
How could anyone sell
such a lovely love as you?

18:03.165 --> 18:05.542
Because there's something
wrong with me.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.878
I just don't know
what it is.

18:07.961 --> 18:11.090
That's why we're going to
do a checkup. Come on.

18:18.972 --> 18:19.848
Heartbeat?

18:20.265 --> 18:22.101
[heart beating]

18:22.434 --> 18:24.269
-Strong.
-Stuffing?

18:24.812 --> 18:25.646
[giggles]

18:25.729 --> 18:26.647
Seems full.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.773
Eyes?

18:29.817 --> 18:30.776
Clear.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.569
Nose?

18:33.529 --> 18:35.864
[Doc] Her nose!
That's it!

18:35.948 --> 18:37.616
What's wrong
with my nose?

18:37.699 --> 18:38.951
You don't have one.

18:40.160 --> 18:40.994
[gasp]

18:41.078 --> 18:42.454
It's gone!

18:42.538 --> 18:44.665
Oh, toys that are
missing parts

18:44.748 --> 18:46.125
are always
the first ones

18:46.208 --> 18:47.876
to end up
in a yard sale.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.712
That must be why
Alma got rid of me.

18:51.046 --> 18:54.049
I know Alma, and I know
how much she loves her toys.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.552
I just don't think
she'd get rid of you

18:56.635 --> 18:58.470
because of something
like a missing nose.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.055
I know I wouldn't.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.723
[exhales] That's good to hear.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.351
But let's give you
a new nose anyway.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.311
What did it look like?

19:06.603 --> 19:10.691
Well, it was plastic and blue

19:11.108 --> 19:13.861
and in the shape
of a triangle.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.989
Great. Now I know
what I'm looking for.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.033
Hallie, I need my box
of toy spare parts.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.493
Way ahead of you, Doc.

19:22.744 --> 19:23.954
Let's see.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.083
Pickles, I'm sorry.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.502
I don't have any
plastic noses right now,

19:30.711 --> 19:32.212
but what about a button?

19:32.296 --> 19:35.674
Oh, buttons are great.
I got two of them.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.011
I think a button
would look
baa-utiful.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.597
If you think so.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.099
[Doc] I only have
one button,

19:44.433 --> 19:45.559
and it's green.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.187
But what if she
doesn't love me

19:48.270 --> 19:50.439
when I have
a green nose?

19:50.898 --> 19:53.650
Pickles, she doesn't love you

19:53.734 --> 19:55.736
because of how you look
on the outside.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.113
She loves you
because of who you are

19:58.197 --> 19:59.406
on the inside.

I guess if Alma loves me,

20:51.124 --> 20:53.543
it won't matter what color
my nose is.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.337
Good. Let's put it on.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.047
Hallie, button nose, please.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.633
[Hallie] One
cute-as-a-cottontail
button nose

20:59.716 --> 21:00.550
coming right up.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.136
[Doc] There.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.514
You look cute
as a button.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.724
And that is pretty cute.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.559
Take a look.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.815
[gasps] I look so...
different.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.567
What if Alma
doesn't recognize me?

21:17.651 --> 21:19.152
Alma loves you.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.989
She'll know you
no matter what
color nose you have.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.158
Okay. I'm ready to find out.

21:25.701 --> 21:29.621
And thanks.
You guys helped me so much.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.499
Come on.
Let's go next door.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.420
Hey, Doc.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.631
Hi, Alma.
I found something

21:39.715 --> 21:41.675
when I was going
through your boxes.

21:41.758 --> 21:45.012
Pickles!
She's not supposed
to be out here.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.972
You weren't
getting rid of her?

21:47.055 --> 21:51.268
No! I love her.
I'd never get
rid of her.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.894
That's what I thought.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.063
Wait. How'd she get
this nose?

21:55.564 --> 21:58.150
Oh. I, uh,
gave it to her.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.610
I saw she was
missing her nose, and--

22:00.694 --> 22:04.614
It is so cute!
I love her green nose.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.200
Mom, Mom, what's
Pickles doing out here?

22:07.451 --> 22:08.618
I don't know.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.996
She must have
fallen in the box
by accident.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.956
You found her
just in time.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.250
The yard sale
is about to start,

22:15.334 --> 22:16.793
and I'm gonna
need your help.

22:17.085 --> 22:21.548
Okay. Doc, I don't want
to take any chances
with Pickles.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.759
Put her in my room
so she's safe.

22:24.092 --> 22:25.761
Yup. I'd love to.

22:36.104 --> 22:38.815
My room!
Oh, I'm home!

22:38.899 --> 22:41.318
Nice digs.
It's baa-utiful.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.380
Doc, you were right.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.509
Alma would never
get rid of me
because of how I look.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.720
She loves me
because of who I am.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.139
That's how I feel
about my toys.

23:11.598 --> 23:12.849
Aw.
Aw.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.768
I'll just get
snuggled up

23:14.851 --> 23:16.144
in my favorite spot...

23:16.812 --> 23:19.314
and wait for Alma
to come play with me.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.192
If you ever
need anything,

23:22.275 --> 23:23.610
you know who to call.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.112
Your friends.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.196
That's us.

23:26.780 --> 23:27.656
Bye!

23:27.739 --> 23:29.533
Don't be a stranger!

23:29.616 --> 23:30.617
[giggles]

23:32.911 --> 23:34.871
Hey, everybody. It's Doc here.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.873
<span style="style.default_1">Luca got a splinter</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in his finger.</span>

23:37.374 --> 23:39.835
<span style="style.default_1">What should you do</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if you get a splinter?</span>

23:39.918 --> 23:40.752
[Stuffy] Stomp! Stomp!

23:40.836 --> 23:42.170
[Doc]
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play dragon stomp</span>

23:42.254 --> 23:43.839
<span style="style.default_1">and knock down all your blocks?</span>

23:46.341 --> 23:48.969
<span style="style.default_1">Should you tell an adult</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so they can remove the splinter?</span>

23:50.262 --> 23:53.098
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play a game of throw</span>
<span style="style.default_1">cotton balls at Stuffy's tummy?</span>

23:55.225 --> 23:58.186
<span style="style.default_1">That's right. Get an adult</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to remove the splinter.</span>
