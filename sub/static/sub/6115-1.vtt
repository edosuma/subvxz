00:40.100 --> 00:43.937
Dogville was in the Rocky Mountains
in the US of A.

00:44.354 --> 00:50.860
Up here where the road came to its
definiteve end near the entrance to the old,
abandoned silver mine.

00:50.985 --> 00:56.991
The residents of Dogville were good,
honest folks and they liked their township.

00:57.116 --> 01:02.371
And while a sentimental soul from the East Coast
had once dubbed their main street ELM STREET,

01:02.371 --> 01:05.499
though no elm tree had ever
cast its shadow in Dogville,

01:05.541 --> 01:09.003
they saw no reason to change anything.

01:09.545 --> 01:15.009
Most of the buildings were pretty wretched;
more like shacks; frankly.

01:15.217 --> 01:18.428
The house in which Tome lived
was the best, though,

01:18.470 --> 01:23.308
and in good times might almost
have passed for presentable.

01:23.558 --> 01:27.646
That afternoon the radio was playing softly,

01:27.771 --> 01:35.904
for in his dotage Thomas Edison Senior
had developed a weakness for music of the lighter kind.

01:36.738 --> 01:41.534
[Radio Presenter] Ladies and Gentlemen...
the President of the United States...

01:42.243 --> 01:45.997
Tom, do me a favor, will you?
The radio!?

01:46.497 --> 01:50.626
Just because the music's over and
you might risk hearing something useful?

01:51.627 --> 01:54.213
I thought that's why we have the radio...

01:54.588 --> 01:57.007
Well, I need a rest, as you know.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.052
Mock me if you like.

02:00.803 --> 02:05.557
[Narrator] Tom's father had been a doctor
and now received a modest pension,

02:05.599 --> 02:11.396
so it was no great disaster for Tom
to drift about not doing anything in particular.

02:11.438 --> 02:16.192
Tom was a writer.
...at any rate by his own lights.

02:16.192 --> 02:22.907
Oh, his output as committed to paper
was so far limited to the words "great" and "small",

02:22.907 --> 02:25.034
followed by question mark,

02:25.076 --> 02:31.082
but nevertheless meticulously archived
in one of his many bureau drawers.

02:32.124 --> 02:33.292
'Bye, Dad.

02:38.255 --> 02:40.049
Evenin' Master Tom.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.134
Good evening, Master Olivia.

02:42.342 --> 02:43.969
Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow.

02:44.011 --> 02:45.220
Noooo

02:50.934 --> 02:56.106
[Narrator] In order to postpone the time
at which he would have to put pen to pater in earnest,

02:56.147 --> 03:01.110
Tom had now come up with
a series of meetings on moral rearmament

03:01.194 --> 03:04.614
with which he felt obliged to benefit the town.

03:04.697 --> 03:06.699
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Tom.

03:07.492 --> 03:08.868
Good evening Chuck.

03:09.243 --> 03:11.829
Will we see you at the meeting tomorrow?

03:11.954 --> 03:14.331
Well, I could do without your lectures.

03:14.373 --> 03:15.958
You know Vera.

03:16.333 --> 03:19.461
Wouldn't give me moment's peace
till I said yes.

03:21.588 --> 03:25.175
Who gave Moses that bone?
It's still got meat on it.

03:25.968 --> 03:27.094
Jason did.

03:27.177 --> 03:29.763
Jason gave that mutt a bone
with meat on it?

03:30.764 --> 03:33.016
When did we last see meat?

03:33.266 --> 03:36.645
Next time you waste good food,
I'll take your knife away.

03:36.645 --> 03:38.605
I would know it was you give'n meat to eat.

03:38.730 --> 03:41.691
Moses was meant to be hungry! To keep watch.

03:41.774 --> 03:43.860
Keep watch in Dogville?

03:44.277 --> 03:46.404
What's there to steal?

03:46.446 --> 03:48.990
These are wicked time, Tom Edison.

03:49.699 --> 03:52.785
Soon there'll be folks by
with even less than us.

03:59.708 --> 04:04.338
[Narrator] Indeed..Tom was busy enough,
even though, formally speaking,

04:04.463 --> 04:07.674
not yet busy with writing per se.

04:08.091 --> 04:12.304
And if a body found it hard to grasp
what profession he was busy at,

04:12.387 --> 04:15.348
he'd merely reply "mining".

04:15.515 --> 04:18.435
For although he did not blast
his way through rock,

04:18.476 --> 04:21.104
he blasted through what was even harder...

04:21.771 --> 04:26.526
namely, the human soul...
right into where it glistered!

04:27.360 --> 04:29.112
- Hey, Martha.
- Hello, Tom.

04:29.278 --> 04:31.948
Listen, they're all comin',
so you just have those benches ready.

04:32.031 --> 04:33.616
Yes, they're ready.

04:33.616 --> 04:37.244
Oh, but Tom, I repeat,
if you need to use my organ

04:37.286 --> 04:40.206
I got to get special permission
from the regional director, Tom.

04:40.206 --> 04:43.334
Martha, and I repeat,
we don't need the organ.

04:43.459 --> 04:46.837
We can be spiritual without singing
or reading from the Bible.

04:47.171 --> 04:50.215
It's almost seven.
Don't forget your bell now.

04:51.883 --> 04:54.094
I imagine that'll do Ma Ginger.

04:54.136 --> 04:57.722
I don't think it's good for the soil
with all the raking and hoeing.

04:58.723 --> 05:01.476
It's the soil that gave life to us all.

05:02.185 --> 05:05.438
Don't give me any of your lip,
Thomas Edison Jr.

05:05.605 --> 05:08.107
I'll hoe as I darn well please!

05:08.149 --> 05:12.612
Yeah, and spoil the whole thing!
I agree with Tom.

05:12.695 --> 05:15.031
Yeah, well he likes eating my pies,
don't you?

05:15.114 --> 05:17.867
Well they're tasty.
No doubt about it.

05:17.992 --> 05:20.953
Yeah. So when it comes to hoeing,
who's right, Tom, you or me?

05:21.078 --> 05:23.122
I'm not so sure it's that simple.

05:23.164 --> 05:24.999
He's got you there Ginger.

05:24.999 --> 05:28.127
You can not resist,
can you, Gloria?

05:28.544 --> 05:30.546
Hey, Ben, I'll get the doors!

05:30.587 --> 05:31.755
I'll be fine, Tom.

05:31.839 --> 05:34.258
Any news from the freight industry?

05:34.341 --> 05:36.343
Is everything going to hell there too?

05:36.385 --> 05:39.471
Don't poke fun at the freight industry.

05:44.184 --> 05:48.563
[Narrator] It was seven o'clock precisely,
as Martha chimed the hour,

05:48.646 --> 05:53.693
and Tom was due to play checkers
with his childhood friend Bill Henson.

05:54.110 --> 05:56.529
Bill was dumb and knew it.

05:57.155 --> 06:02.618
Far too dumb to qualify as an engineer,
he was certainly sure of that.

06:02.993 --> 06:11.085
After listening for a while to the piledriver
down the valley that Ben insisted was working
on the foundation of a new penitentiary,

06:11.210 --> 06:15.047
Tom headed for the Henson home
in order to inflict upon Bill

06:15.130 --> 06:18.842
yet another humiliating defeat at checkers.

06:19.801 --> 06:27.017
Some folks might say the opportunity
to meet Bill's older sister, Liz, was more of a draw
than the checkerboard,

06:27.058 --> 06:29.394
and they might be right.

06:29.978 --> 06:34.565
It was a fact that in the Henson home
lay another horizon.

06:34.899 --> 06:39.278
A horizon just as alluring
as the one beyond the valley.

06:39.987 --> 06:44.241
A horizon bound by Liz Henson's
luscious curves.

06:44.241 --> 06:49.163
- No one's getting it?
- A sweet, painful, seductive abyss.

06:49.163 --> 06:50.956
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Tom.

06:50.998 --> 06:55.085
Must you come by every single day?
Huh!?

06:55.127 --> 06:58.297
It'd be a lot more fun if someone
interesting appeared for a change.

06:59.172 --> 07:02.092
You know I really am so lonesome in this town.

07:03.385 --> 07:07.305
The moment my fiancee writes
that he's gotten that job in Bolder, I'm off.

07:07.389 --> 07:10.558
Then the whole lot of you will
have to find some other girls' skirts to peek up.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.685
Is.. uh.. Bill in?

07:13.186 --> 07:15.396
Well, isn't he always?

07:15.688 --> 07:18.441
He studies and I help out with the glasses.

07:18.483 --> 07:21.444
Even though everybody knows
that I'm the clever one.

07:21.944 --> 07:24.655
- Hey, Mrs. Henson.
- Good evening, Tom.

07:25.031 --> 07:27.950
Checkers time, Bill ol' Buddy.

07:29.702 --> 07:30.995
Was that..??

07:31.412 --> 07:33.580
You didn't hear the bell?

07:34.790 --> 07:39.461
[Narrator] As usual Bill tried to fake
his way around actually playing.

07:39.753 --> 07:44.466
He had not yet fully comprehend
this meeting business, he claimed.

07:45.550 --> 07:47.302
Maybe you should just let them be?

07:47.344 --> 07:48.970
I don't think so... I... I...

07:49.095 --> 07:51.514
What if they're just fine as they are?

07:51.556 --> 07:54.309
You think they're fine?
I don't think so.

07:54.350 --> 07:56.477
I think there is a lot
this country has forgotten.

07:56.561 --> 08:00.481
I just try and refresh folk's memory
by way of illustration.

08:00.690 --> 08:02.608
So... so the illustration for tomorrow?

08:02.608 --> 08:05.069
mmmh.. I don't know.

08:06.904 --> 08:10.491
See if the people of Dogville have
a problem with the acceptance.

08:10.574 --> 08:14.161
What they really need is something
for them to accept,

08:14.745 --> 08:18.123
something tangible,
like a gift.

08:19.082 --> 08:22.586
Why in the heck would someone
up and give us a gift?

08:22.586 --> 08:24.046
I don't know.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.214
I might have to do some thinking.

08:26.798 --> 08:33.596
Wait, wait, .. the ...
we're missing a piece.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.141
We won't be able to play.

08:44.816 --> 08:48.903
My mind is sharp tonight.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.831
'Night, Bill.

09:16.137 --> 09:19.849
[Narrator] Despite considerable effort
on his part to prolong things,

09:19.891 --> 09:23.728
Tom had achieved the triumph
at the checkerboard pretty quickly.

09:24.228 --> 09:27.940
It had started to rain and
the wind had become a regular gale

09:27.940 --> 09:31.068
when Tom strolled home through Elm Street.

09:31.777 --> 09:38.200
If Tom were to prove that the citizens of Dogville
had a problem receiving in his lecture in the next day

09:38.325 --> 09:42.704
he sorely lacked an illustration,
a gift.

09:42.996 --> 09:44.957
Bill might have been right.

09:44.998 --> 09:49.670
It hadn't exactly rained gifts
on this particular township.

10:27.539 --> 10:30.250
There was no doubt in his mind.

10:30.292 --> 10:32.544
They were gun shots.

10:32.753 --> 10:36.673
The pile driver in the marshes
didn't sound like that at all.

10:36.756 --> 10:38.967
The shots had come from down in the valley,

10:39.009 --> 10:43.179
or perhaps from Canyon Road some place
in the direction of Georgetown.

10:45.390 --> 10:51.521
He listened for more shots for ages.
But they were not repeated.

10:53.898 --> 10:59.111
A tad disappointed, Tom sat down
on the old lady's bench to think,

10:59.153 --> 11:02.823
to hang onto the feeling of danger
for a moment.

11:03.866 --> 11:08.829
But it wasn't long before his thoughts
were back on his favorite subjects again,

11:08.954 --> 11:15.001
and in the midst of the storm they metamorphosed
into articles and novels and great gatherings

11:15.043 --> 11:23.468
that'd listen in silence to Tom after the publication
of yet another volume that scourged and purged the human soul.

11:23.968 --> 11:27.847
And he saw men,
and among them even other writers,

11:27.889 --> 11:34.687
throw their arms round one another as,
through his words, life had opened up for them anew.

11:35.396 --> 11:37.231
It hadn't been easy.

11:37.356 --> 11:44.321
But by his diligence and application
to narrative and drama his message had gotten through,

11:44.530 --> 11:49.868
and asked about his technique he would
have to say but one word:

11:50.869 --> 11:52.913
"illustration".

12:11.931 --> 12:15.726
Tom could have spent another
half hour or more on the bench,

12:15.768 --> 12:19.563
but another unusual noise roused him.

12:19.689 --> 12:22.233
It was Moses barking.

12:22.358 --> 12:27.404
Oh, that wasn't unusual in itself,
but it was the way he barked that was new.

12:27.655 --> 12:31.033
His barking was not loud,
but more of a snarl,

12:31.116 --> 12:37.456
as if the danger was quite close at hand
and not merely a passing raccoon or fox.

12:37.748 --> 12:44.754
as if the dog were standing face to face
with a force to be taken seriously.

12:44.963 --> 12:51.052
Hey, Lady!
I wouldn't go up there if I were you.

12:53.179 --> 12:58.184
I know the mountain well,
I doubt if I'd get away with my life.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.186
It's a very nasty drop.

13:06.317 --> 13:08.360
Is there another way?

13:09.153 --> 13:10.195
Yeah.

13:13.991 --> 13:15.367
Where?

13:16.451 --> 13:20.539
Back down the way you came from.
Back down to Georgetown.

13:21.415 --> 13:23.625
Why do you need to get out of the mountain?

13:23.917 --> 13:26.962
Did you have anything to do
with those gunshots?

13:32.967 --> 13:35.303
Help me, help me please.

13:35.303 --> 13:37.889
You can hide in the mine,
in there!

13:47.022 --> 13:48.607
Hey, where's this road headed to?

13:48.691 --> 13:50.818
No where. It's a dead end.

13:50.859 --> 13:55.239
If you want to pass, turn around,
go back by way of Georgetown.

13:55.280 --> 13:58.158
This place... uh..
it's called Dogville.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.703
Dogville? Well it figures,
it's a stupid name if I ever heard one.

14:02.621 --> 14:04.790
Hey, we're looking for somebody...

14:04.831 --> 14:06.791
Oh, really, who might that be?

14:08.877 --> 14:11.337
My boss wants to talk to ya.

14:11.755 --> 14:13.715
- Young man.
- Yes, sir.

14:14.048 --> 14:20.012
I'm looking for a girl. She may have made
her way to your town in her confusion.

14:20.012 --> 14:25.059
I don't want any harm to come to her.
You see, she's very precious to me.

14:25.101 --> 14:28.521
Well sir, uh..
nobody's been through Dogville recently.

14:28.562 --> 14:32.441
Moses would have barked.
He's very suspicious of strangers.

14:32.525 --> 14:36.695
Ah ha.. That's very wise Moses.

14:36.779 --> 14:43.869
Please take my card and if perhaps..
uh.. you see a stranger,

14:43.952 --> 14:45.662
give me a call.

14:45.954 --> 14:49.958
I am in a position to offer
a considerable reward.

14:50.041 --> 14:52.961
Yes sir. Thank you.

14:53.753 --> 14:56.881
uh.. say was it you that fired those shots?

15:09.143 --> 15:16.650
Well they're gone.
You want to come out now?

15:26.076 --> 15:29.746
You want a cup of coffee
before you go mountain-climbing?

15:32.666 --> 15:35.085
That would be nice.

15:38.213 --> 15:41.507
[Narrator] The beautiful fugitive's name was Grace.

15:41.841 --> 15:46.846
She hadn't chosen Dogville from a map
or sought out the township for a visit,

15:46.888 --> 15:51.100
yet Tom felt right away that she belonged.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.853
Shall I take the bone?

15:59.608 --> 16:02.861
[Narrator] She could have kept
her vulnerability to herself,

16:02.945 --> 16:07.199
but she had elected to give herself up
to him at random.

16:08.617 --> 16:12.704
As.. yes.. a gift.

16:12.829 --> 16:16.958
"Generous, very generous",
thought Tom.

16:17.042 --> 16:23.590
You want to eat?
You must be hungry?

16:23.631 --> 16:25.091
I can't.

16:26.384 --> 16:28.845
I don't deserve that bread!

16:29.720 --> 16:34.725
I stole that bone.
I haven't stolen anything before.

16:35.851 --> 16:39.605
So now, now I have to punish myself.

16:39.647 --> 16:46.945
I was raised to be arrogant,
so I had to teach myself these things.

16:48.405 --> 16:54.077
Well, it may be best for your education...

16:55.078 --> 17:00.417
Grace, in this town in these times...

17:01.292 --> 17:05.338
it is very impolite not to eat
what's set before you.

17:07.298 --> 17:09.550
I'm so sorry.

17:20.644 --> 17:24.648
Who were the men in the car?
Why would they want to hurt you?

17:26.942 --> 17:32.072
The man in the back of the car,
he's the boss. I saw his face.

17:32.864 --> 17:37.786
He gave me his telephone number,
told me to call if I saw you.

17:37.911 --> 17:42.624
I'm sure he'd offered you a big reward
if you told him where I was.

17:42.707 --> 17:44.000
Yeah.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.131
Where's your family?

17:50.173 --> 17:52.008
I don't have a family.

17:52.049 --> 17:54.719
All I had was a father...

17:56.220 --> 18:01.142
but those gangsters took him away from me.

18:01.976 --> 18:04.728
What if I said you could stay here?

18:04.853 --> 18:06.188
Here?

18:06.230 --> 18:09.650
But even if you meant it, it's impossible.

18:11.777 --> 18:17.282
It's very small town, I have to hide.
People will ask questions.

18:17.491 --> 18:21.995
Well, it might not matter.
Not if they all wanted to help you too.

18:23.330 --> 18:26.166
Are you saying that everybody
in this town is like you?

18:26.166 --> 18:30.920
They're good people.
You know, they're honest people.

18:31.045 --> 18:33.464
They've all been in need themselves.

18:33.548 --> 18:36.259
They might well turn you down, but...

18:37.301 --> 18:39.929
I think it would be worth the trouble to ask.

18:39.929 --> 18:43.182
But I got nothing to offer them in return.

18:43.474 --> 18:47.102
No, I think you have plenty to offer Dogville.

18:55.027 --> 18:59.739
[Narrator] To call the mood of the audience
at Tom's morale lecture in the mission house the next day,

18:59.781 --> 19:05.036
"enthusiastic" would have been going to far,
but they had come.

19:05.036 --> 19:10.792
And Tom had launched himself fearlessly
into his endeavor to illustrate the human problem:

19:10.875 --> 19:12.877
To receive.

19:17.256 --> 19:22.887
The subject was obvious, but quite
dreadfully ill-considered by this young man.

19:23.012 --> 19:27.725
To compensate for his lack of preparation
Tom made diligent use of his technique

19:27.725 --> 19:32.020
of lashing out somewhat haphazardly
in all directions.

19:32.730 --> 19:36.650
His father peered around covertly
to gauge the mood,

19:36.650 --> 19:41.780
and sensing that the assembly was not
entirely happy with this rather direct criticism,

19:41.822 --> 19:44.866
he decided to forestall any protest.

19:44.866 --> 19:47.952
Now I'm sure that you wish us well, Tom,

19:48.244 --> 19:53.666
but um.. of any town, I believe this one has
a very fine sense of community.

19:53.791 --> 19:56.544
Living side by side we all know one another.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.546
I'm a pretty fair judge of character myself.

19:58.588 --> 20:01.299
Honestly, Tom, you've done it again.

20:01.299 --> 20:03.843
Made us come here to listen
to a lot of nonsense.

20:04.176 --> 20:07.096
What do you think you are,
some kind of philosopher?

20:07.138 --> 20:08.973
Observant, that's what I am.

20:09.014 --> 20:12.935
Lazy, I would say.
We shovel snow together.

20:12.935 --> 20:14.728
We shovel snow together?

20:14.770 --> 20:15.562
Yeah.

20:15.646 --> 20:18.523
Every household clears their own front walk.

20:18.565 --> 20:23.403
Yeah, I gotta allow that Tom's right on that.
If roads don't get
cleared properly...

20:26.198 --> 20:28.950
I'm sorry Tom, you're going to have to
come up with something better than that.

20:28.992 --> 20:34.622
But the whole country would be better served
with a greater attitude of openness and accenpance.

20:34.706 --> 20:38.084
You're suggesting that we all
wouldn't help out if someone needed help.

20:38.126 --> 20:39.794
No, that's not the point.
That's not the point.

20:39.836 --> 20:41.129
We care for human beings up here.

20:41.129 --> 20:44.382
We would probably never find out.

20:48.969 --> 20:53.057
Since nobody seems to want to admit
that there's a problem,

20:54.391 --> 20:56.643
let me illustrate.

20:58.187 --> 21:02.107
Now I'm not going to use something
that's already happened.

21:03.483 --> 21:07.028
I'm going to use something
that's just about to happen.

21:10.490 --> 21:16.746
[Narrator] And, after providing a quick summary
of the events of the previous evening
to the astonished people of Dogville,

21:16.829 --> 21:22.835
Tom went down to the mine to retrieve
the fugitive from her hideaway.

21:30.509 --> 21:36.765
Allow me to introduce Grace.
Grace, these are the citizens of Dogville.

21:37.725 --> 21:39.309
- Hello.
- Hello.

21:42.813 --> 21:45.482
Tom has told us about your predicament, Miss.

21:45.565 --> 21:48.318
I really don't want to put any of you
in jeopardy.

21:48.401 --> 21:50.111
Why don't you just go to the police?

21:50.153 --> 21:53.865
They can take care of gangsters!
It's their job.

21:53.865 --> 21:58.828
I, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
The transportation
business would uh...

21:58.870 --> 21:59.412
Ben!

22:00.204 --> 22:08.379
These men, they have powerful connections,
even with the police.

22:08.462 --> 22:11.424
Do you think we should give
sanctuary to a fugitive?

22:11.465 --> 22:16.595
A fugitive that gangsters wanna get a hold of.
That would put us in pretty pickle.

22:16.637 --> 22:18.389
Easy, Claire...
think of your asthma.

22:18.389 --> 22:21.183
Dogville is a good place to hide,
that's for certain.

22:21.266 --> 22:24.228
Exactly.
The only way up here is Canyon Road.

22:24.728 --> 22:31.401
That could easily be watched by Ma Ginger's
-excuse me-nosey cousin who lives
only yards from the turn off.

22:31.526 --> 22:34.529
She has a telephone.
Martha, you could ring the bell,

22:34.571 --> 22:37.032
tell the town if people were coming.

22:38.324 --> 22:43.288
But Tom, I chime the hours,
what if people get confused with all the ringing?

22:43.371 --> 22:47.667
Come now, Martha.
Surely we can use our old bell to save a life, if need be.

22:47.708 --> 22:50.086
Why should we?

22:50.544 --> 22:53.672
Because we care, Chuck.
We care for other human beings.

22:53.714 --> 22:55.257
No, that ain't what I mean.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.719
How do we know that this woman is
telling us the truth?

22:58.761 --> 23:03.640
Maybe these gangsters did shoot at her,
but that don't make her somebody to be trusted.

23:03.724 --> 23:09.021
He is right.
Why would you trust me?

23:09.688 --> 23:11.189
I trust you!

23:11.314 --> 23:14.192
Tom, we're not gangsters.

23:14.234 --> 23:19.572
We mind our own business
we don't ask nothin' from nobody.

23:20.865 --> 23:22.367
So at last you admit it!

23:22.450 --> 23:27.705
If only there were some way,
we wouldn't doubt the young lady's word.

23:27.789 --> 23:29.207
some way to know her..

23:29.248 --> 23:31.584
Then I think we would all ignore the risk.

23:32.752 --> 23:35.588
But there is a way!
You said it yourself.

23:35.671 --> 23:38.507
By living side by side with her.

23:39.133 --> 23:41.719
Dad, you are such a fine judge of character.

23:41.760 --> 23:45.222
How long would it take a good man
like you to unmask her?

23:45.347 --> 23:49.059
A week? Maybe two?

23:49.309 --> 23:51.728
Surely we can offer her two weeks.

23:52.896 --> 23:56.650
And if after that time so much as
one man cries out 'BE GONE!'

23:56.691 --> 24:00.570
I promise I'll happily send her
packing herself.

24:08.369 --> 24:12.707
Well, if Master Tom thinks this is right
for us, and for the
community,

24:12.707 --> 24:19.338
then that will do for me.
He might be young, but his heart is right.

24:19.588 --> 24:23.092
And I've known his heart
for as long las it's been beating.

24:32.559 --> 24:36.521
[Narrator] No more words were spoken
at the town meeting in the mission house.

24:36.605 --> 24:42.694
But it had been decided, they all felt,
that the fugitive would be given two weeks.

24:42.902 --> 24:46.114
And they would all be able to look
at themselves in the mirror and know

24:46.197 --> 24:52.787
that they had done what they could, indeed,
and perhaps more than most people would have done.

24:54.997 --> 25:03.714
So that very afternoon Tom took Grace on a stroll
down Elm Street to introduce her to the town "he loved".

25:03.797 --> 25:08.552
Well, this is where Olivia and June live.

25:08.552 --> 25:14.474
June is a cripple...
They live here as a token of my dad's broadmindedness.

25:14.683 --> 25:18.520
Chuck and Vera have seven children
and they hate each other.

25:18.895 --> 25:27.195
Next door we have the Hensons.
They make a living from grinding edges off
cheap glasses to try to make them look expensive.

25:27.237 --> 25:32.617
And here we have Jack McKay.
Now, Jack McKay is blind and the whole town knows it.

25:32.659 --> 25:37.413
But he thinks he can hide it
by never leaving his house.

25:37.497 --> 25:39.915
In the old stable Ben keeps his truck.

25:39.957 --> 25:46.797
He drinks and he visits the whorehouse
once a month and he is ashamed of it.

25:46.839 --> 25:53.679
Martha she runs the mission house
until the new preacher comes which will just never happen.

25:54.555 --> 26:01.186
That leaves Ma Ginger and Gloria.
They run this really expensive store,

26:01.228 --> 26:05.440
where they exploit the fact
that nobody leaves town.

26:05.940 --> 26:10.278
Used to leave to go vote,
but since they put on the registration fee,

26:11.237 --> 26:17.243
about a day's wage for these people,
they don't feel the democratic need any more.

26:20.705 --> 26:25.209
Those awful figurines say more about
the people in this town, than many words.

26:25.251 --> 26:29.755
If this is the town that you love,
then you really have a strange way of showing it.

26:31.298 --> 26:40.932
All I see, is a beautiful little town
in the midst of magnificent mountains.

26:41.641 --> 26:50.275
A place where people have hopes
and dreams even under the hardest conditions.

26:52.068 --> 26:56.698
And seven figurines that are not awful at all.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.453
[Narrator] Calling Dogville beautiful was
original at least.

27:02.954 --> 27:10.544
Grace was just casting one more look
at the figurines she herself would have dismissed
as tasteless a few days earlier,

27:10.836 --> 27:19.720
when she suddenly sensed
what would best have been described
as a tiny change of light over Dogville.

27:40.907 --> 27:43.993
They are keeping an eye on you.

27:43.993 --> 27:49.123
If you love them already,
they might need a little persuading.

27:50.666 --> 27:53.961
You've got two weeks
to get them to accept you.

27:54.378 --> 27:57.256
You make it sound like
we are playing a game.

27:58.006 --> 28:05.931
It is. We are. Isn't saving your life
worth a little game?

28:06.098 --> 28:07.891
What do you want me to do?

28:08.058 --> 28:10.018
Do you mind physical labour?

28:10.268 --> 28:12.228
No!

28:13.313 --> 28:16.483
Dogville has offered you two weeks.

28:17.901 --> 28:20.111
now you offer them...

28:35.167 --> 28:38.754
[Narrator] The next day was
a beautiful day in Dogville.

28:38.796 --> 28:42.966
The tender leaves on Ma Ginger's
goosberry bushes were unfurling

28:42.966 --> 28:47.804
despite wise Tom's misgivings
as regards her gardening methods.

28:48.138 --> 28:56.813
But more than that, this first day of spring
had also benn picked to be Grace's first ever day of work.

28:56.896 --> 29:04.195
The day in which she was to set off around
Dogville and ofeer herself one hour per household per day.

29:04.195 --> 29:05.446
Excuse me.

29:08.699 --> 29:13.662
I would like to offer you my help..
if there is anything that you need?

29:15.080 --> 29:19.710
Yeah.. A carburetor that don't leak..

29:21.837 --> 29:24.840
alright here, let me take that.

29:25.090 --> 29:27.467
Maybe I could help around your home?

29:28.635 --> 29:35.308
I don't really have a home.
Just the garage.

29:37.686 --> 29:40.563
I'm in the freight business.
The road is my home!

29:40.605 --> 29:42.649
I'm ready. Good morning!

29:42.690 --> 29:44.651
Miss Olivia has got a home.

29:45.360 --> 29:49.113
She is looking to help out
in somebody's home.

29:49.197 --> 29:51.657
A cleanin' lady for a cleanin' lady?

29:52.366 --> 29:55.536
You be talkin' nonsense, Mister Ben!

29:55.745 --> 29:56.912
Have a good day!

29:56.954 --> 30:00.291
Alright. See ya later on!

30:00.958 --> 30:05.087
[Narrator] And off Ben went to Georgetown
with the weekly shipment of glasses

30:05.087 --> 30:11.843
that Mr. Henson had so laboriously cleansed
with his polisher of any trace of their cheap manufacture.

30:16.139 --> 30:22.270
So Grace turned into the alley
which went by the exotic name, Glunen Street

30:23.646 --> 30:28.443
to knock on the door of the blind,
but only too vain, man.

30:30.278 --> 30:31.279
Yes?

30:32.572 --> 30:35.950
Good morning, Mr. McKay.
My name is Grace.

30:36.158 --> 30:40.496
I was wondering if there is anything
I can do for you?

30:41.247 --> 30:43.958
Oh, that's very kind of you, Grace,
but...

30:44.041 --> 30:48.670
I was thinking that perhaps because of
the situation that you are in...

30:49.296 --> 30:51.715
What situation am I in?

30:52.966 --> 30:59.806
Hmm... You are.. on your own.

31:01.683 --> 31:06.813
Oh, I have been on my own for so long.

31:07.438 --> 31:09.774
Anything that you might need?

31:11.317 --> 31:13.069
I'm sorry!

31:13.111 --> 31:19.325
Have you ever noticed the wooden spire
on the roof of the mission house?

31:19.325 --> 31:26.707
At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, it points
a shadow at Ginger's grocery store,

31:26.749 --> 31:34.214
right at the O in OPEN
on the sign in the window.

31:35.340 --> 31:39.010
Maybe it is telling people that it is time
to go shopping for supper.

31:40.220 --> 31:42.722
Goodbye, Mr. McKay.

31:44.015 --> 31:45.683
Bye, Grace!

31:46.059 --> 31:51.814
[Narrator] Grace's interview with Jack McKay
proved sadly
symptomatic of the attitude in Dogville.

31:52.982 --> 31:57.445
Reserved but friendly,
not without curiosity.

31:59.071 --> 32:03.826
Only Jack had expressed his "no"
consicely and precisely:

32:04.034 --> 32:09.373
Martha needed a monologue almost
an hour long to arrive at the same conclusion.

32:09.415 --> 32:13.043
Oh my goodness... I, I, I'd have to think of
work for you to do,

32:13.085 --> 32:15.545
because I have barely enough work myself.

32:16.254 --> 32:21.051
[Narrator] So not very much later Grace had
ended up next to Ma Ginger's gooseberry bushes

32:21.092 --> 32:24.846
in a mood that was not particularly good.

32:26.306 --> 32:29.392
She could not tell a gooseberry bush
from a cactus,

32:29.476 --> 32:33.146
but the meticulous order in the yard
appealed to her,

32:33.438 --> 32:37.733
such as the metal chains placed there
in order to shield the second and third bushes,

32:37.817 --> 32:44.323
lest anybody decided to make use of
the deplorably time-honored shortcut to the old lady's bency.

32:45.074 --> 32:50.079
Grace pulled herself together and
headed towards the store.

32:53.207 --> 32:54.249
Hello!

32:55.459 --> 33:00.922
Hello. We don't need any help here either.
I told that to Tom.

33:00.922 --> 33:05.427
Wow, it doesn't matter anyway,
because there is nothing I can do.

33:05.594 --> 33:08.096
I have never worked a day in my life, so.

33:11.808 --> 33:16.938
You know, if you put some aloe on
those hands of yours they'll be better by morning.

33:17.021 --> 33:20.608
It's the wood shavings.
I really do hate them.

33:22.026 --> 33:24.445
But I do believe I'll take your advice.

33:24.528 --> 33:27.948
Your hands are surely the most
alabaster hands I've ever seen.

33:27.990 --> 33:31.285
Here comes Tom, how lucky we are.

33:32.161 --> 33:37.499
Hi, all. Grace.. how is all going?

33:37.666 --> 33:39.960
- Not very well, I'm afraid.
- Really?

33:39.960 --> 33:42.087
No. Nobody needs any help.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.589
Well, I thought that might be the case.

33:44.714 --> 33:49.970
His plan to make everybody like me
has run into a few problems

33:50.053 --> 33:52.388
because nobody wants me to work for them.

33:52.388 --> 33:55.475
I would really like to offer something in return.

33:56.684 --> 33:59.729
You're all running a terrible risk
having me here.

34:00.980 --> 34:02.982
I mean, I am willing to learn.

34:03.065 --> 34:07.695
There must be someone who needs help.
Mr. McKay's sight is not good.

34:07.695 --> 34:12.283
Yes, I went to Mr. McKay.
I went to Martha and to Chuck and Vera's,

34:12.324 --> 34:14.910
and nobody seems to need any help.

34:15.035 --> 34:17.996
They all think everyone else needs
something, and not themselves.

34:18.038 --> 34:22.084
Funny, that's exactly what Tom said.
I supposed he's pleased.

34:23.627 --> 34:29.257
Just to prove him wrong,
maybe you can lend a hand here.

34:30.008 --> 34:33.261
But Ginger, there really isn't anything
we need done.

34:33.303 --> 34:35.597
Perhaps there's something
you don't need done?

34:36.139 --> 34:37.849
Anything we don't need done?

34:37.891 --> 34:43.813
Something.. something that you would like
done, but that you don't think is necessay.

34:43.980 --> 34:45.940
What on earth would that be?

34:45.982 --> 34:48.317
Maybe... maybe the gooseberry bushes.

34:48.359 --> 34:50.861
The gooseberries are just fine,
thank you very much.

34:51.028 --> 34:55.157
No. Not yours. The ones that planted
themselves in the tall grass.

34:55.824 --> 34:57.326
We don't grow anything there.

34:57.368 --> 35:01.079
Exactly. A bit of tiding up.

35:01.413 --> 35:05.459
Who knows, those bushes might
one day bear fruit.

35:05.542 --> 35:08.587
Yeah. That's true! Who knows..

35:08.670 --> 35:10.338
All right, girl.

35:11.506 --> 35:18.471
Those alabaster hands of yours are
hereby engaged to weed the wild gooseberry bushes.

35:19.764 --> 35:20.890
Thank you!

35:22.433 --> 35:25.228
Around.. like this, you see.

35:26.104 --> 35:29.398
Anything to close them...
just be careful, that's all.

35:31.233 --> 35:35.279
[Narrator] After a few of the wild little
gooseberry bushes had given up the ghost

35:35.279 --> 35:39.825
in the care of Grace's as yet
unpracticed alabaster hands,

35:39.867 --> 35:44.663
things began looking up
with the weeding and the town.

35:46.665 --> 35:54.381
In fact it turned out there were not so few things
that the other townsfold of Dogville didn't need doing either.

35:55.298 --> 36:01.846
As Ben had no home, Grace's domestic
experiments were absolutely things he didn't need,

36:02.472 --> 36:09.187
but he put up with them anyhow,
appearing with astonishing punctuality
when the act of domesticity had been completed,

36:09.228 --> 36:14.442
no matter how unpredictable business
hours in the freight industry might otherwise have been.

36:18.112 --> 36:22.950
Olivia didn't need anyone to help June
to the toilet while she was at work,

36:22.991 --> 36:28.997
as hitherto they had coped splendidly
with Olivia's excellent diaper arrangement.

36:30.666 --> 36:37.922
If Jack McKay had needed a partner
for conversation he would surely have gone out
and gotten one for himself in the town.

36:38.214 --> 36:43.261
So it was not out of need that he allowed
Grace to sit with him in his dark parlor

36:43.303 --> 36:51.853
with the dramatic drapes on one wall
for lengthy discussions regarding
the underestimated qualities of the light on the East Coast.

36:53.604 --> 36:59.443
As Martha wouldn't dream of burdening
the parish with wear and tear of the pedals and bellows,

36:59.485 --> 37:05.491
while waiting for the new priest to be appointed,
she practiced without a note ever leaving the organ,

37:05.532 --> 37:10.037
and was therefore not really
in need of anyone to turn her pages.

37:11.163 --> 37:17.252
And God knows that Mr. and Mrs. Henson's son
did not need any help with his books,

37:17.794 --> 37:21.965
and that the family had taken Grace
for her own sake.

37:26.761 --> 37:31.265
And although Liz's hands had improved
through Grace's good counsel,

37:31.391 --> 37:36.896
Thomas Edison was a doctor and
of indisputable health and he did not need care,

37:37.021 --> 37:41.192
or help with the pills from the medicine
closet with its many secrets.

37:45.446 --> 37:49.992
Actually Chuck was the only one
"not yet hooked", as Tom put it.

37:50.075 --> 37:56.373
Hooked? You sound so arrogant!
Arrogance is the worst thing!

37:56.665 --> 37:58.500
He doesn't like me.

38:00.252 --> 38:02.295
And he has every right to feel that way.

38:02.337 --> 38:08.468
Yeah. Listen!
Luckily I have prepared a Trojan horse.

38:09.135 --> 38:09.969
A what?

38:10.136 --> 38:12.847
Trojan horse.
We can get in by way of Vera.

38:12.972 --> 38:21.689
There is this.. lecture tomorrow
in Georgetown, given by some professor.

38:21.814 --> 38:25.985
Some intellectual thing.

38:26.610 --> 38:31.031
But not so intellectual he can't tour
the provinces with it, anyway, the point is,

38:31.365 --> 38:36.745
Vera she would do anything to go,
but she's got no one to mind Achilles while she is gone.

38:36.953 --> 38:42.709
She trusts the girls mastering their iambs
and pentameters, but not with the little one.

38:42.709 --> 38:48.089
So this is where you come in.
I said that you could watch him tomorrow afternoon.

38:48.214 --> 38:55.138
Now, I will try and stall her on her way home
and with a bit of luck, Chuck'll get back before she does

38:55.179 --> 38:59.892
and you can use the time and
all your charm to try and win him over.

38:59.934 --> 39:03.521
I'll happily mind Achilles if Vera will let me.

39:03.604 --> 39:07.024
But if he doesn't like me he doesn't like me.

39:08.025 --> 39:13.155
[Narrator] Tom really was enchanted by this
unusual, mysterious creature.

39:13.447 --> 39:18.910
And even though she did not satisfy
his curiosity by saying
anything about her past

39:18.952 --> 39:28.503
so as not to put anyone in danger,
she still fitted Tom's mission to educate Dogville
on the subject of acceptance like a glove.

39:29.129 --> 39:31.214
Tom felt content.

39:31.214 --> 39:36.928
Grace had been dangling over the edge,
and he had been the one to pull her back onto the path.

39:36.969 --> 39:43.225
It gave him a fine sensation of mastery,
new for him in terms of the opposite sex,

39:43.392 --> 39:48.147
and his feelings unleashed the best
in his burgeoning love.

39:59.157 --> 40:10.502
Hello. This is Dahlia, Olympia, Diana,
Athena, Pandora, Jason, Achilles.

40:15.048 --> 40:16.591
Your children are lovely.

40:16.716 --> 40:23.806
They are good kids. And I love them.

40:29.228 --> 40:34.358
Please don't say any such nice things
about the kids. I cry too easily.

40:36.276 --> 40:39.029
Both in sorrow and in joy.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.949
- Hey, Vera.
- Oh, hi!

40:42.324 --> 40:44.451
- Shall we go?
- I'm ready.

40:44.826 --> 40:47.120
Thanks for leaving the map out.

40:47.204 --> 40:51.333
I'd a plum forgot it, I'm sure.
How did you know I was going that far?

40:51.666 --> 40:56.337
The last time I saw the thermos,
it was on the doorstep and the map was beside it,

40:56.337 --> 41:01.676
so I just thought, when I saw the thermos
this time and no map, but...

41:03.719 --> 41:06.305
You are a sweet girl, Grace.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.724
Sweet as Miss Laura.

41:09.058 --> 41:10.351
Who's Miss Laura?

41:10.393 --> 41:12.853
You gave yourself again, Ben.

41:12.895 --> 41:17.566
I think Miss Laura is
what Ovid might call a Maenad.

41:22.112 --> 41:24.573
Oh, don't be ashamed, Ben.

41:25.032 --> 41:28.326
We all have the right to make the most of our lives.

41:28.410 --> 41:34.040
I'm sure that those ladies in those houses
they bring a lot of joy to a lot of men.

41:35.417 --> 41:41.130
Ain't nothing I'm proud of.
It really ain't.

41:58.981 --> 42:01.108
I know what you are doing here.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.111
You do?

42:05.279 --> 42:09.908
You want people to like you,
so you don't have to go away.

42:11.535 --> 42:13.286
You are very smart.

42:15.705 --> 42:18.458
Yes, I like it here in Dogville.

42:18.500 --> 42:24.130
Do you want me to read to you?
About the Cyclops?

42:24.714 --> 42:27.425
I don't like the Cyclops.

42:28.426 --> 42:34.515
Two eyes are pretties, like yours.

42:39.311 --> 42:45.275
If you want my Ma to like you, and let you stay.
You'll just have to be nice to me.

42:48.153 --> 42:50.530
Maybe you should help me clean up instead.

42:50.906 --> 42:55.827
Ma says I don't have to work,
'cept in my head.

42:55.994 --> 42:59.998
Oh, but what about if I ask you, please?

43:00.206 --> 43:01.166
Ok.

43:15.513 --> 43:16.847
What are you doing here?

43:16.972 --> 43:19.475
Didn't I tell you we don't need
no help from you?

43:19.517 --> 43:21.477
Ma asked her to mind me and Achilles.

43:21.477 --> 43:24.688
Quiet! Get out! The lot of you.

43:27.524 --> 43:29.276
The same nonsense!

43:29.943 --> 43:32.863
They'd have done just great in Antiquity,
no doubt.

43:33.989 --> 43:37.659
How is it going otherwise,
with the fooling act?

43:41.454 --> 43:43.373
I wasn't trying to fool anyone?

43:44.833 --> 43:48.211
I mean Dogville.
Has it got you fooled yet?

43:51.464 --> 43:55.426
I thought you were implying
that I was trying to exploit the town.

43:55.968 --> 43:58.012
Wishful thinking.

44:00.014 --> 44:03.934
This town is rotten from the inside out,

44:04.476 --> 44:07.354
and I wouldn't miss it,
if it fell into the gorge tomorrow.

44:07.813 --> 44:15.404
I see no charm here, but you seem to.

44:15.904 --> 44:19.032
Admit it you've fallen for Dogville.

44:20.200 --> 44:24.329
The trees, the mountains,
the simple folk.

44:24.913 --> 44:28.249
And if all that ain't got you fooled yet,
I bet the cinnamon has.

44:28.750 --> 44:32.336
That damned cinnamon
in those gooseberry pies.

44:33.212 --> 44:36.841
Dogville has everything that you ever
dreamed of in the big city.

44:37.091 --> 44:42.221
You are worse than Tom.
How do you know what I dreamed of?

44:46.892 --> 44:49.686
You're from the city yourself, aren't you?

44:49.812 --> 44:51.647
That was a long time ago.

44:51.897 --> 44:55.525
I am not that stupid anymore,
I found out that people are the same all over.

44:55.525 --> 44:57.110
Greedy as animals.

44:58.070 --> 45:00.822
In a small town they're just a bit
less successful.

45:00.822 --> 45:03.700
Feed 'em enough they'll eat
till their bellies burst.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.952
That's why you wanted to get rid of me...

45:06.661 --> 45:11.457
because you can't stand that I remind
you of what it was you came here to find.

45:19.507 --> 45:21.634
I'm telling you for the last time
to get out of my home.

45:21.759 --> 45:23.928
Moses don't like you.
And I don't like you.

45:24.428 --> 45:27.056
The kids are going crazy enough
from their ma's teachin'.

45:27.097 --> 45:28.766
Thank you, Grace!

45:47.117 --> 45:52.163
[Narrator] The two seeks had passed far too quickly.
Grace had enjoyed herself.

45:52.747 --> 45:56.209
All she could say was that
she was fond of them all,

45:56.292 --> 46:00.880
including the folk who had greeted her
with reluctance and hostility.

46:01.297 --> 46:07.344
Even though she might not have won everybody
over completely or even half way, as Tom put it,

46:08.095 --> 46:14.268
She cared for Dogville and she had shown
the town her face, her true face.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.728
But was that enough?

46:17.271 --> 46:23.610
During Jack McKay's long lecture that evening
she had found herself in a heart-searching mood.

46:24.027 --> 46:28.114
Whether heart-searching or
concern for her future was the cause,

46:28.198 --> 46:36.706
the result was that the otherwise so lovable
Grace indulged in a pretty shady piece of provocation.

46:36.706 --> 46:45.756
So you agree that the windows of St. Bridget's,
at the first time you saw them,
didn't live up to their reputation.

46:46.465 --> 46:52.221
I don't think it is the position of the church itself.

46:52.346 --> 47:03.190
Maybe it's the light in Los Angeles and
the mosaic glass in those windows they kind of collide,

47:05.192 --> 47:07.444
I remember thinking that.

47:09.237 --> 47:13.908
I think we've talked long enough about
the way we remembering seeing things.

47:14.117 --> 47:15.326
Don't you?

47:16.953 --> 47:22.959
Why don't we talk about something
that we can see right now?

47:23.668 --> 47:29.256
There is not much to see around here.
Wretched town.

47:30.591 --> 47:32.718
Why don't we talk about the view?

47:37.097 --> 47:45.522
I don't go out much.
The sun and my skin.

47:45.522 --> 47:48.817
Yesterday I was walking in Chuck's apple trees.

47:50.777 --> 47:57.659
If you go right up to the edge of the cliff
you just manage to peer round Ben's garage

47:57.659 --> 48:01.329
and you get a view of your house
from the side facing the gorge.

48:02.038 --> 48:07.793
I didn't realize that there was windows behind there.

48:08.628 --> 48:15.217
Huge windows.
There must be a wonderful view.

48:16.802 --> 48:19.221
Would you mind if I opened them?

49:00.761 --> 49:07.142
You're no fool, Miss Grace.
You're no fool.

49:08.810 --> 49:12.856
You probably see that those curtains
are hard to open.

49:12.939 --> 49:14.024
Sorry!

49:16.901 --> 49:23.491
And obviously concluded that it's because
they're not used very often.

49:25.743 --> 49:32.291
But the view's good, entrancing even.

49:36.128 --> 49:47.931
So, ask me, why a man who loves the light
hang these heavy curtains?

49:55.147 --> 49:59.567
Yes, I'm blind.

50:00.026 --> 50:07.158
Not weak sighted, not myopic: blind.

50:09.452 --> 50:20.880
So please go
and let me be that on my own.

50:27.553 --> 50:36.770
Is Switzerland they call it the Alpengulen.

50:38.188 --> 50:43.151
That's the light that reflects
from the highest peaks

50:43.568 --> 50:48.656
after the sun goes down behind the mountains.

50:50.908 --> 50:52.743
But now it's gone.

51:17.017 --> 51:22.188
[Narrator] It was in complete silence
that the people of Dogville turned up for the meeting
at the mission house

51:22.230 --> 51:26.359
two weeks to the day since the beautiful
fugitive had come to town.

51:28.820 --> 51:32.782
Grace was standing beside Tom,
watching them convene,

51:32.865 --> 51:40.081
and knew inside herself that this might well be
the last time she would see these now so familiar faces.

51:40.164 --> 51:45.794
She had at least two of them against her,
and even one would have been too many.

51:47.004 --> 51:49.840
Welcome good people of Dogville.

51:49.882 --> 51:57.514
Two weeks.... two weeks have passed
and it is time for your verdict.

51:57.889 --> 52:01.852
Is it right that she should be here while we talk?

52:01.893 --> 52:06.189
Well, Mrs. Henson, when Grace first came
she made no attempt to hide her weakness from us.

52:06.231 --> 52:14.405
So I think it is only right we be as open
with her, tell her to her face if we want her to leave.

52:14.947 --> 52:17.074
No, Mrs. Henson is right.

52:17.492 --> 52:22.621
Nobody should be prevented from
speaking their mind out of politeness.

52:23.706 --> 52:25.583
I'll wait at the mine.

52:26.208 --> 52:33.173
And if the vote says that I should leave,
then I'll take the path across the mountains, while it's still light.

52:34.216 --> 52:38.136
And the things I've borrowed, if you could,
return them to everybody.

52:38.262 --> 52:39.262
Of course!

52:39.262 --> 52:41.807
Nobody has to see me before I go.

52:42.265 --> 52:45.810
Martha, if you will just ring the bell
then I'll understand.

52:46.144 --> 52:49.147
I don't ... how do...
am I gonna ring the bell?

52:49.647 --> 52:53.484
Just ring it for every vote that lets me stay.

52:53.818 --> 53:00.575
I will count. And if it doesn't reach
fifteen, then I'll leave.

53:09.416 --> 53:15.255
Tom is anxious to speak in her behalf,
but I think he's had his allotted time.

53:15.339 --> 53:20.761
We know his view. We respect it.
And now he must respect ours.

53:21.803 --> 53:26.600
[Narrator] Grace pulled her bundle out from
under the bureau to change into her own clothes,

53:26.641 --> 53:31.354
only to discover that somebody had been
in it and left a loaf of bread.

53:33.356 --> 53:36.150
Next to it was a folded sheet of paper.

53:36.276 --> 53:39.112
It was a map Tom had drawn.

53:39.112 --> 53:42.782
He had known where the bundle was
and had put it there.

53:42.824 --> 53:45.201
It showed the path across the mountain.

53:45.243 --> 53:50.623
And all the dangerous spots were
furnished with witty horrific little sketches.

53:52.333 --> 53:54.126
But there was more.

53:54.209 --> 54:00.716
Several people had the same idea.
They had eased gifts into the bundle for her.

54:00.757 --> 54:05.637
Jason's beloved little penknife lay there,
all polished and shiny.

54:05.721 --> 54:11.851
And a pie from Ma Ginger and Gloria.
And some clothing and matches, and a hymnal.

54:12.227 --> 54:17.649
Grace opened it at number 18, where Martha
always had trouble with fingering.

54:19.067 --> 54:25.781
And between the pages lay a dollar bill
Martha alone could not have afforded it.

54:26.490 --> 54:31.162
Grace had friends in Dogville.
That was for sure.

54:31.203 --> 54:34.999
Whether they were few or many did not matter a jot.

54:35.207 --> 54:40.546
Grace had bared her throat to the town
and it had responded with a great gift:

54:40.963 --> 54:42.923
with friends.

54:48.220 --> 54:54.225
No gangster could deprive her of this
meeting with the township,
no matter how many guns in the world.

54:54.726 --> 55:00.607
And should the strokes of the bell did not reach 15,
she knew now that she meant something to the town

55:00.690 --> 55:03.860
and that her stay had been of significance.

55:03.901 --> 55:09.240
Not much, perhaps, but nevertheless,
a trace she had left.

55:10.157 --> 55:14.078
And the first in her young life
in which she took pride.

55:28.175 --> 55:31.803
Grace stiffened as the bell began its toll.

56:16.137 --> 56:19.516
Fourteen. Grace counted.

56:19.933 --> 56:27.899
So McKay must have voted for her after all,
and if so, why not Chuck, too?

57:09.939 --> 57:11.399
Everyone?

57:13.025 --> 57:14.610
- Chuck!
- Chuck!

57:14.944 --> 57:16.487
Everyone.

57:17.822 --> 57:20.491
I think they like you here.

57:39.176 --> 57:44.055
[Narrator] The period of spring and early summer
proved a happy one for Grace.

57:44.597 --> 57:47.851
Martha rang the hours,
conducting her through the day.

57:47.892 --> 57:52.855
So she could serve as eyes for McKay,
a mother for Ben,

57:53.856 --> 57:59.028
friend for Vera,
and brains for Bill...

58:08.579 --> 58:15.127
And one day it had occurred to Grace
to tread the pedals herself so to get Martha to agree

58:15.127 --> 58:18.505
to play a couple of paper notes,
just to empty the bellows naturally

58:18.547 --> 58:22.676
so that they wouldn't be left under pressure
and thus be spoiled.

58:23.426 --> 58:28.973
And now they had tacitly agreed that
as long as it was Grace who trode the pedals,

58:29.015 --> 58:32.185
Martha could play without feeling any guilt.

58:36.481 --> 58:41.819
To Tom's pop, the old doctor, who imagined
he had a new ailment every single day

58:41.819 --> 58:47.116
and was thus increasingly addicted to
the simpler coordination tests
from his medical school days,

58:47.116 --> 58:51.954
she had to be severe, telling him that
there was nothing wrong with him.

58:54.790 --> 58:59.628
And now, since the town had agreed that
everyone was to give according to his abilities

58:59.669 --> 59:05.800
she received wages, not much, but enough
to save up for the first of the tiny china figurines

59:05.800 --> 59:11.222
from the row of seven that had stood
for so long gathering dust in the window of the store.

59:12.432 --> 59:17.311
And she dreamed that in time she would
be able to acquire them all.

59:20.273 --> 59:28.239
Slowly those alabaster hands turned
into a pair of hands that could have belonged to
anyone in any little rural community.

59:29.448 --> 59:35.996
And three weeks later she triumphantly
moved into a place Tom and Ben had secretly restored,

59:36.038 --> 59:41.084
namely the old mill, which had once held
the town's ore crusher,

59:41.126 --> 59:45.380
but of which only the heavy
flywheel now remained.

59:52.595 --> 59:53.388
Thanks.

59:53.680 --> 59:56.474
That's what I am talking about
with the freight industry.

59:57.266 --> 1:00:00.603
Miss Laura had thrown that out,
it was no use to anybody.

1:00:01.896 --> 1:00:06.275
A good thing, in the wrong place.
But with my truck... You know.

1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:08.986
You shouldn't poke fun at
the freight industry, that's all.

1:00:10.362 --> 1:00:13.365
No, you're right, Ben.
They shouldn't.

1:00:19.830 --> 1:00:20.872
Grace!

1:00:22.958 --> 1:00:23.792
What?

1:00:24.584 --> 1:00:29.381
I just had to tell you that I had a really
selfish reason for voting to keep you in Dogville.

1:00:33.927 --> 1:00:35.094
What was it?

1:00:36.971 --> 1:00:42.351
It was such a relief when you turned up
and you were the one all the men had eyes for.

1:00:42.894 --> 1:00:48.524
You know, Tom and them.
I've had to put up with it for so long..

1:00:49.442 --> 1:00:52.736
Frankly, I just didn't have
the energy for it anymore.

1:00:53.112 --> 1:00:55.489
They'll always have eyes for you, Liz.

1:00:56.991 --> 1:01:03.413
You know that.. They will.
You are beautiful.

1:01:03.497 --> 1:01:04.373
Thank you.

1:01:06.041 --> 1:01:10.212
[Narrator] The very latest development,
now that summer was at its peak,

1:01:10.337 --> 1:01:14.049
was that Grace had been given leave
to help Chuck in the orchard.

1:01:14.799 --> 1:01:21.723
And every day at 5, once their work was done,
she could appreciate that actually McKay was right;

1:01:21.764 --> 1:01:27.395
the shadow of the spire did indeed
point at Ma Ginger's store.

1:01:31.190 --> 1:01:36.320
But today the tower did not only announce
that it was time to go shopping but also,

1:01:36.362 --> 1:01:43.035
by a signal which nobody despite Martha's
initial concern could have confused with the ringing of the hours,

1:01:43.243 --> 1:01:48.498
a warning that somebody was approaching
via Canyon Road from Georgetown.

1:01:48.665 --> 1:01:54.462
For the first time in living memory
law enforcers had come to Dogville!

1:02:03.554 --> 1:02:04.889
Evenin' sir.

1:02:07.308 --> 1:02:09.560
Is this the whole place?

1:02:10.728 --> 1:02:13.314
- There's a town hall?
- No.

1:02:13.564 --> 1:02:15.441
I got me a notice to paste up.

1:02:15.566 --> 1:02:18.527
We got the mission house.
That do you?

1:02:18.986 --> 1:02:20.154
Sure.

1:02:21.196 --> 1:02:22.406
What'd she do?

1:02:22.990 --> 1:02:28.120
Missing! That's all it says.
I guess somebody's been missing her.

1:02:28.287 --> 1:02:30.872
Heard tell she was last seen around here.

1:02:31.706 --> 1:02:34.042
We've putting these things
all over the county.

1:02:35.168 --> 1:02:37.212
And if somebody sees her,
they ought to go to the police?

1:02:37.962 --> 1:02:39.881
I guess that's the idea.

1:03:11.912 --> 1:03:14.456
These men were never gonna give in easily.

1:03:15.415 --> 1:03:19.878
Now these posters they hang
all over in the county.

1:03:21.504 --> 1:03:24.382
which means nobody suspects
she's right here with us.

1:03:24.424 --> 1:03:28.344
But it was a policeman, Tom.
Isn't it a duty to respond to the police?

1:03:28.344 --> 1:03:36.686
I mean, legally speaking.
I'm sorry, I just.. when I get upset.

1:03:37.311 --> 1:03:41.106
She's just a missing person.
She hasn't done anything. He even said so.

1:03:41.148 --> 1:03:42.775
I think you should vote again.

1:03:42.775 --> 1:03:48.363
Why? We can't resort to plebiscites
time and time again.

1:03:49.615 --> 1:03:56.246
Come on. Who's really got cold feet
because of her picture on a piece of paper?

1:04:19.226 --> 1:04:28.610
[Narrator] The 4th of July came with the huge
clouds of seeds from some remote meadow
gracefully floating down Elm Street in the early evening.

1:04:28.819 --> 1:04:34.574
Today was a day for celebration.
Nobody was to worry about the hard times.

1:04:34.700 --> 1:04:38.286
And Grace could stop at Ma Ginger's
window quite content:

1:04:38.662 --> 1:04:44.334
to ascertain that only two of the little china
figurines remained, and were thus the only two

1:04:44.334 --> 1:04:48.004
she had not yet been able to
save up enough to purchase.

1:04:52.425 --> 1:04:54.302
- It looks great, girls..
- Uh-huh..

1:04:56.512 --> 1:05:01.058
Grace, could you put in a couple of hours
with me in the orchard again today?

1:05:01.434 --> 1:05:04.186
It's really nice down there with the sunshine!

1:05:04.353 --> 1:05:09.942
Chuck, it's the fourth of July!
What are you talking about sunshine for?

1:05:11.151 --> 1:05:14.112
Have you turned into a romantic like me?

1:05:18.158 --> 1:05:19.701
We're gonna have fun.

1:05:20.952 --> 1:05:22.996
And in the winter we'll all starve...

1:05:23.705 --> 1:05:26.583
Even Ben's taking the day off.

1:05:28.251 --> 1:05:30.211
- Hi!
- Hi, Tom!

1:05:30.462 --> 1:05:32.338
Grace, you've got a moment?

1:05:34.674 --> 1:05:35.675
Now?

1:05:36.843 --> 1:05:40.388
Yeah. I've got something
interesting to tell you.

1:05:42.265 --> 1:05:44.266
Well, it has to be quick.

1:05:51.982 --> 1:05:54.234
I've got so much going on in my head...

1:05:55.652 --> 1:05:58.322
That must be very tiring for you!

1:05:59.489 --> 1:06:02.826
I think I've done a pretty good analysis
of the folks in this town

1:06:06.162 --> 1:06:12.168
and I think I understand them
in a meaningful way.

1:06:14.337 --> 1:06:20.093
But when I come to decipher you,
I get absolutely nowhere.

1:06:20.384 --> 1:06:25.056
You know Liz...
Liz is easy to read.

1:06:28.017 --> 1:06:30.853
And there was some attraction between us,

1:06:33.772 --> 1:06:36.275
but as I can see right through her,

1:06:37.067 --> 1:06:40.320
intellectually I mean, I can see right through her,

1:06:40.571 --> 1:06:48.203
my desire is purely of a physical nature.

1:06:50.747 --> 1:06:58.588
But with you, it's more...
it's more complicated.

1:06:58.588 --> 1:07:00.506
What are you trying to say?

1:07:03.843 --> 1:07:06.470
No, I should get it clear in my head first.

1:07:08.973 --> 1:07:11.559
Are you trying to say that ...

1:07:13.686 --> 1:07:15.938
you're in love with me?

1:07:17.815 --> 1:07:29.326
No, I wouldn't.. love is...
It's not... It's a big word...

1:07:29.367 --> 1:07:30.076
Yeah.

1:07:34.622 --> 1:07:35.874
Yeah.

1:07:38.001 --> 1:07:39.335
That's good!

1:07:43.297 --> 1:07:44.590
because ...

1:07:48.636 --> 1:07:51.972
I think that I am in love with you, too.

1:07:53.599 --> 1:07:55.643
Very interesting, isn't it?

1:07:57.519 --> 1:08:01.607
I mean it's interesting in a psychological...

1:08:07.946 --> 1:08:12.325
Did they call you?
I think they are calling you.

1:08:15.453 --> 1:08:17.330
I didn't hear them.

1:08:20.792 --> 1:08:21.960
No.

1:08:25.129 --> 1:08:29.258
You should probably get back anyway.

1:08:32.178 --> 1:08:35.598
I will see you at the wedding.
Next celebration..

1:09:10.631 --> 1:09:14.593
This year I didn't bring any notes with me.

1:09:14.969 --> 1:09:18.055
Because I'm not gonna pretend
I can read them.

1:09:19.890 --> 1:09:23.769
Which brings me to a point.
A point I wanna make.

1:09:24.728 --> 1:09:28.607
And that point is you, Grace.

1:09:29.566 --> 1:09:36.281
Yes. You have made Dogville
a wonderful place to live in.

1:09:37.032 --> 1:09:43.538
As a matter of fact, somebody tells me
they ran into grumpy old Chuck down the street

1:09:43.830 --> 1:09:45.999
and he was actually smiling.

1:09:47.917 --> 1:09:54.799
Well, I've never seen your smile, Grace,
but I will bet you I could describe it.

1:09:56.801 --> 1:10:05.100
Because it obviously has every color
that's reflected from the shiniest prism in the world.

1:10:05.934 --> 1:10:09.938
You probably have a face to match that.
Does she have a face to match that, Tom?

1:10:10.022 --> 1:10:12.190
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm..?
- Yes, sir.

1:10:12.274 --> 1:10:16.862
I bet she does.
We are proud to have you among us.

1:10:18.113 --> 1:10:24.327
And we thank you for
showing us who you are.

1:10:24.953 --> 1:10:26.871
Here to you, Grace.

1:10:27.705 --> 1:10:30.333
Stay with us as long as you damn please.

1:10:54.064 --> 1:10:58.485
A police car has just been seen in town and
it has just made the turn up Canyon Road!

1:10:59.152 --> 1:11:00.320
So he will be here any minute.

1:11:00.654 --> 1:11:02.072
Shall I ring the bell?

1:11:03.031 --> 1:11:05.950
No, Martha.
Grace probably heard.

1:11:07.285 --> 1:11:08.828
We'll get rid of 'em quickly.

1:11:10.038 --> 1:11:11.122
Don't worry.

1:11:24.802 --> 1:11:28.138
Should have been celebrating myself,
if this hadn't come up.

1:11:28.889 --> 1:11:31.517
Have to change this missing person notice.

1:11:32.851 --> 1:11:34.645
It's that lady again.

1:11:36.188 --> 1:11:37.939
That's why she disappeared.

1:11:40.025 --> 1:11:44.070
She's wanted in connection with some
bank robberies on the West Coast.

1:11:44.779 --> 1:11:47.157
When did these robberies take place?

1:11:47.615 --> 1:11:49.200
Last couple of weeks.

1:11:50.577 --> 1:11:52.829
You don't get much news up here,
do you?

1:11:52.954 --> 1:11:55.498
My dad's radio only plays music.

1:11:57.708 --> 1:12:00.586
Well, all know is that they say she's dangerous,

1:12:00.795 --> 1:12:05.216
and that anyone with any information
about her had better call us pronto.

1:12:05.633 --> 1:12:07.092
That's the law.

1:12:22.607 --> 1:12:27.529
Two weeks!
Can't be our girl, Tom.

1:12:27.988 --> 1:12:29.989
No, she's been here all the time.

1:12:29.989 --> 1:12:30.865
Right!

1:12:30.949 --> 1:12:33.326
She couldn't have done
what they are accusing her of.

1:12:34.535 --> 1:12:36.287
No, that's true, Tom,
you are right.

1:12:36.537 --> 1:12:39.540
Still it's an unpleasant business
just the same.

1:12:47.006 --> 1:12:50.217
[Narrator] Grace was the same
and so was the town.

1:12:51.010 --> 1:12:58.600
That the gangsters had fixed to have
charges made against Grace in their effort
to neuralize her came as no surprise.

1:12:59.851 --> 1:13:03.188
But everything had changed a little
yet again.

1:13:03.230 --> 1:13:10.070
I'm telling you, you have exactly the same
kind of little lump in exactly the same spot
on the other side of your back.

1:13:10.111 --> 1:13:10.904
Really!

1:13:10.904 --> 1:13:21.497
I can only assume that it belongs
on your body, but you're the doctor, so...

1:13:21.873 --> 1:13:28.212
Well, it's very unlikely, don't you think?
that a cancer would develop in such precise symmetry.

1:13:28.212 --> 1:13:34.051
- Mr. Edison, please. We've been
over this so many times.
- Anything is possible.

1:13:34.093 --> 1:13:41.683
I think you have to accept the fact
that you are an exceptionally healthy elderly gentleman.

1:13:42.225 --> 1:13:44.644
I'm gonna rest just the same.

1:13:44.728 --> 1:13:46.188
I'll see you in the morning.

1:13:46.646 --> 1:13:47.981
I hope so.

1:13:48.565 --> 1:13:50.900
What? What did they say?

1:13:51.109 --> 1:13:58.199
Well, they couldn't really argue
that anything had changed.

1:13:58.491 --> 1:14:03.413
But by not telling the police they felt
they were committing a crime themselves.

1:14:07.124 --> 1:14:09.001
- I think I should leave.
- No..

1:14:09.085 --> 1:14:10.419
Enough is enough.

1:14:10.461 --> 1:14:12.296
I suggested the opposite.

1:14:13.339 --> 1:14:14.465
You did?

1:14:14.965 --> 1:14:18.469
From a business perspective, ...

1:14:19.887 --> 1:14:26.309
from a business perspective,
your presence in Dogville has become more costly.

1:14:27.019 --> 1:14:30.480
Because it's more dangerous
for them to have you here,

1:14:30.647 --> 1:14:32.857
not that they don't want you,

1:14:33.566 --> 1:14:39.072
since they feel there should be
some counterbalance,

1:14:39.948 --> 1:14:41.991
some quid pro quo.

1:14:42.033 --> 1:14:44.911
That sound like words
that the gangsters would use...

1:14:45.119 --> 1:14:49.957
There is also more of an incentive
if you don't wanna stay.

1:14:52.001 --> 1:14:58.924
See, with all those wanted posters
hanging around the place, I can hardly
think of anywhere else you could hide.

1:15:01.009 --> 1:15:04.012
So what's the counterbalance
that you suggested?

1:15:07.766 --> 1:15:14.064
They wanted you to work longer hours,
but instead what I proposed is

1:15:14.064 --> 1:15:19.819
that you just pay a visit to folks
twice a day now.

1:15:19.944 --> 1:15:26.451
That way it would seem that you're willing
to contribute more, without actually
lengthening your day too much.

1:15:26.576 --> 1:15:29.537
It's just a way of heading off
any unpleasantness.

1:15:34.959 --> 1:15:41.965
Well, it sounds a little peculiar
and difficult to put into practice.

1:15:41.965 --> 1:15:43.967
That's what I thought.

1:15:44.384 --> 1:15:47.888
Martha she said she would ring
her bell every half hour,

1:15:47.971 --> 1:15:51.099
so you could keep track of
your new schedule.

1:15:53.977 --> 1:15:55.770
Then, they are all willing to let me stay?

1:15:55.812 --> 1:16:03.611
No. See, Mrs. Henson she also
thought we should cut your pay.

1:16:04.112 --> 1:16:12.787
Merely a symbolic gesture. You see...
the word dangerous on that poster worried her.

1:16:14.789 --> 1:16:21.587
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
If I have to work harder, longer hours for less pay,

1:16:21.629 --> 1:16:24.757
then I'm willing to do that.
Of course, I am.

1:16:26.508 --> 1:16:31.680
I just wanna be sure that they
wouldn't prefer that I left town.

1:16:31.722 --> 1:16:33.223
Of course not.

1:16:35.809 --> 1:16:38.103
You think this is for the best?

1:16:38.979 --> 1:16:40.855
I know it is.

1:16:44.317 --> 1:16:52.575
I have to get some sleep. My days are
gonna be much busier now.

1:16:52.617 --> 1:16:53.951
Sorry.

1:17:18.517 --> 1:17:25.065
Tom, I just need to know something...

1:17:27.692 --> 1:17:31.321
you know the card that the man
in the car gave you...

1:17:31.529 --> 1:17:32.447
Yeah.

1:17:38.369 --> 1:17:40.621
Did you show it to anyone?

1:17:41.330 --> 1:17:46.043
Come on, Grace!
I burned it first thing.

1:17:46.543 --> 1:17:50.130
I've been so silly.
Of course you did.

1:17:50.172 --> 1:17:51.632
It's alright.

1:17:52.382 --> 1:17:57.095
No, it's not alright. I hate it
for you to see me like this.

1:17:57.137 --> 1:17:59.431
I can't bare that I'm doubting you.

1:17:59.848 --> 1:18:02.601
I'm sorry.
Good night.

1:18:22.828 --> 1:18:27.625
[Narrator] Everybody was really against
any changes to Grace's working conditions at all

1:18:27.708 --> 1:18:30.627
when the subjuct occasionally
came up in conversation.

1:18:38.593 --> 1:18:42.931
Oh, Ben had declared in sympathy that
he wouldn't accept any more work than before,

1:18:43.056 --> 1:18:45.058
and Grace was grateful for that,

1:18:46.351 --> 1:18:49.062
even if he was a bit drunk
when he said so.

1:18:52.565 --> 1:18:59.030
Busy minute became busy hours,
and busy hours became busy days.

1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:06.412
and irrespective of whether they thought
the idea of increasing Grace's services had
any fairness and justification to it or not,

1:19:06.495 --> 1:19:09.582
it didn't seem to make anyone any happier.

1:19:09.707 --> 1:19:12.001
More to the contrary.

1:19:13.877 --> 1:19:17.506
Grace, oh.. You have to be more careful.

1:19:17.881 --> 1:19:21.718
Liz wasn't very careful either,
but she didn't break our glasses.

1:19:22.094 --> 1:19:28.141
I think you need to understand that Mr. Henson
works very hard to grind off any traces of moulds.

1:19:28.683 --> 1:19:32.687
and it makes the glass weak.
I thought you knew that.

1:19:32.771 --> 1:19:36.774
It won't happen again.
Of course, I'll pay for it.

1:19:37.525 --> 1:19:41.362
No, of course not. You don't have to
pay us for it. We'll get over it.

1:19:43.406 --> 1:19:49.453
[Narrator] And off she went to keep
her appointment with Chuck to free
the last tree trunks from the grass

1:19:49.453 --> 1:19:52.665
in order to keep the ever busy mice away.

1:19:53.457 --> 1:19:57.336
She was in a hurry and took the shortcut
between the gooseberry bushes,

1:19:57.377 --> 1:19:59.671
only to be brought up by a shout.

1:19:59.796 --> 1:20:01.715
- Grace!
- Yes!

1:20:04.468 --> 1:20:10.557
Oh, I didn't see that you just
raked the path. I'm sorry.

1:20:10.598 --> 1:20:12.726
It isn't that I've just raked it.

1:20:12.934 --> 1:20:17.647
The idea is that people can pass
around the bushes completely.

1:20:17.730 --> 1:20:19.857
I prefer it that way,
as you should know.

1:20:21.109 --> 1:20:26.614
I thought that these chains were put up
to make a path between the bushes.

1:20:26.614 --> 1:20:28.908
They were put up there to protect the bushes.

1:20:28.908 --> 1:20:30.785
It is not supposed to be a pathway.

1:20:30.868 --> 1:20:32.703
But everyone goes this way.

1:20:33.370 --> 1:20:36.999
Dear, that's right.
They have been living here for years.

1:20:37.041 --> 1:20:38.709
You haven't been here that long.

1:20:40.294 --> 1:20:46.717
Are you saying, that I am less entitled
to use the shortcut
because I haven't always lived here?

1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:47.592
No, of course not.

1:20:48.426 --> 1:20:52.180
"No, I just thought it pleased you
to be here, that's all."

1:20:52.806 --> 1:20:55.058
"Go on.
Go on, it's alright."

1:20:55.475 --> 1:20:57.227
I'll see you this afternoon..

1:20:57.310 --> 1:21:02.357
"and I'll rake those bushes like they've
never been raked before, I promise."

1:21:09.780 --> 1:21:14.243
I'm sorry about that branch.
There were so many apples on it.

1:21:16.161 --> 1:21:19.623
"I should have cut that brance,
but I got greedy."

1:21:20.874 --> 1:21:23.836
Is it greedy to want to feed your family?

1:21:29.549 --> 1:21:31.510
So how come you don't like me?

1:21:35.430 --> 1:21:37.640
Why do you ask me that?

1:21:38.349 --> 1:21:40.351
"When I get close to you,
you edge away."

1:21:42.353 --> 1:21:45.273
"- No, I don't.
- You did so."

1:21:46.274 --> 1:21:48.943
When we were thinning the seedlings
in the bottom row.

1:21:50.111 --> 1:21:53.489
How am I supposed to show you what I do
if I ain't allow to touch you?

1:21:55.574 --> 1:21:57.493
You tried to kiss me.

1:22:05.959 --> 1:22:11.298
Vera never took any interest in the apples.
She hates the orchard.

1:22:13.008 --> 1:22:18.346
"The is the first time I've ever met anyone,
who understand about the apples."

1:22:19.472 --> 1:22:21.641
Sorry... it made me so happy.

1:22:25.895 --> 1:22:27.063
It's alright.

1:22:27.105 --> 1:22:32.109
"No, it ain't alright. I reckon the stuff
about the apples is just words in your mouth."

1:22:33.277 --> 1:22:35.571
If you can't really share my pleasure...

1:22:36.155 --> 1:22:37.406
I do.

1:22:38.657 --> 1:22:42.745
Vera wants me to picking apples
from trees that are barely in the ground.

1:22:43.662 --> 1:22:46.081
Things take time. That's love!

1:22:46.790 --> 1:22:51.336
Seeing what they need and
respecting those needs.

1:22:51.461 --> 1:22:53.880
"If anyone understands that, it's you.
At least I thought so."

1:22:53.922 --> 1:22:55.298
I do understand that.

1:22:55.298 --> 1:22:57.551
But you edge away when I get close.

1:22:58.051 --> 1:23:01.888
- Why do you find me so repugnant?
- I don't find you repugnant.

1:23:04.015 --> 1:23:05.642
Don't be upset.

1:23:07.268 --> 1:23:11.439
I'm sorry if I doubted you.
It won't happen again.

1:23:13.482 --> 1:23:15.151
I promise you.

1:23:17.737 --> 1:23:20.531
I wouldn't make that promise if I were you.

1:23:26.704 --> 1:23:29.623
"When you fended me off,
a thought came into my mind"

1:23:29.832 --> 1:23:34.461
that made me ashamed.
A thought that you would hate me for.

1:23:35.379 --> 1:23:39.090
"I would never hate you, never."

1:23:44.137 --> 1:23:44.971
What?

1:23:47.473 --> 1:23:53.563
"Chuck, I've treated you unfairly.
It's alright to have angry
thoughts."

1:23:55.523 --> 1:23:58.442
I thought of turning you in!

1:24:00.403 --> 1:24:02.988
I thought of blackmailing you
into respecting me.

1:24:12.664 --> 1:24:18.003
"It means that much to you?
It does, doesn't it?"

1:24:20.463 --> 1:24:23.425
"You've really been alone up here,
haven't you?"

1:24:23.967 --> 1:24:30.765
You haven't had anyone to comfort you
and I should ask you for forgiveness.

1:24:38.272 --> 1:24:39.815
Still friends?

1:25:09.344 --> 1:25:12.472
- Sorry... Were you asleep?
- No.

1:25:13.473 --> 1:25:17.560
"- Do you want me to leave?
- No, I was just resting."

1:25:17.810 --> 1:25:25.234
"Awful lot to do here in Dogville,
considering nobody needs anything done."

1:25:27.236 --> 1:25:30.614
Jason wants to sit on my lap all the time.

1:25:34.451 --> 1:25:37.412
I think you're doing a wonderful job.

1:25:39.164 --> 1:25:43.543
You give us all so much.
What Mr. McKay said...

1:25:43.585 --> 1:25:47.130
right on the button..
right on the button.

1:25:47.672 --> 1:25:50.675
He tried to put his hands on my knee today.

1:25:50.717 --> 1:25:54.554
"Oh, he is blind, after all.
Probably an accident."

1:25:57.932 --> 1:26:05.064
And Ma Ginger got angry at me
for running across the gravel path.

1:26:07.358 --> 1:26:10.903
"Well good. She gets angry at me,"

1:26:12.988 --> 1:26:15.491
which just means that you're one of us now.

1:26:15.574 --> 1:26:18.368
"You can see through it all, can't you?"

1:26:34.384 --> 1:26:37.595
"I'll tell you, I'm gonna be asleep
in two minutes."

1:26:37.929 --> 1:26:40.473
What if I don't want you to go to sleep?

1:26:40.807 --> 1:26:43.100
I don't think you have a choice tonight.

1:26:54.361 --> 1:26:56.530
"I do love you, Grace."

1:26:57.906 --> 1:27:04.121
"I'm glad you love me.
I love you, too. I really do."

1:27:08.458 --> 1:27:14.381
"No, I mean, I yearn for you
when I am not with you."

1:27:18.676 --> 1:27:22.638
I yearn for you even
when we're alone like this.

1:27:24.891 --> 1:27:31.814
"I yearn to be even closer to you...
to touch you, the way that people..."

1:27:31.856 --> 1:27:34.733
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

1:27:37.736 --> 1:27:41.949
The thing that I love about you is
that you don't demand anything of me.

1:27:42.074 --> 1:27:46.286
That we can just be together.

1:27:46.495 --> 1:27:47.662
Yeah.

1:27:49.748 --> 1:27:53.168
Yearning will only make it better.

1:28:00.508 --> 1:28:06.222
"Thank you for your words,
your wise wise words."

1:28:08.266 --> 1:28:10.017
You're welcome.

1:28:13.187 --> 1:28:14.772
Do you want your shoes off?

1:28:41.256 --> 1:28:45.677
"Jason, what are you doing here?
That's wrong."

1:28:47.011 --> 1:28:49.806
The words have to be divided differently.

1:28:52.141 --> 1:28:53.309
Stop it.

1:28:53.684 --> 1:28:56.312
How's that for dividing the words?

1:28:58.606 --> 1:29:01.066
This is not a good day.
Everybody should leave.

1:29:01.108 --> 1:29:04.528
"Everybody except Jason.
Jason, I wanna talk to you alone."

1:29:04.862 --> 1:29:08.115
What is it?
What's going on?

1:29:09.408 --> 1:29:13.912
I can be very bad.
I bet my pa told you.

1:29:13.912 --> 1:29:17.874
I don't think that.
I think there is another reason for this.

1:29:19.334 --> 1:29:24.380
"I'd love to have you on my lap all the time,
but I can't, not with the others here."

1:29:26.174 --> 1:29:29.886
"When somebody can't do all the things
they'd like to do for others,"

1:29:30.428 --> 1:29:33.723
sometimes the people they promised get mad.

1:29:35.016 --> 1:29:37.435
That's what Mrs. Henson says.

1:29:39.437 --> 1:29:40.521
"Yes, that's true."

1:29:40.563 --> 1:29:43.774
I suppose I know why you won't let
me sit in your lap anymore.

1:29:45.109 --> 1:29:47.361
- Why?
- Because I've been mean lately.

1:29:47.402 --> 1:29:51.657
"Oh, come on. I'm sure you have
your reasons for that."

1:29:52.157 --> 1:29:56.912
"I have been mean to the others, too,
even baby Achilles."

1:29:57.204 --> 1:30:00.290
And he's so tiny he can't put up a fight.

1:30:01.750 --> 1:30:04.711
"- It's not right
- No, it's not."

1:30:04.836 --> 1:30:08.214
"I got it coming to me, I know."

1:30:08.923 --> 1:30:10.466
I deserve a spanking.

1:30:10.508 --> 1:30:13.886
What? I should hit you?
I'm not gonna do that.

1:30:14.846 --> 1:30:18.265
Your mother doesn't believe in
physical discipline. I'm not gonna hit you.

1:30:18.307 --> 1:30:22.853
I know. She'd be awful mad
if she found out you whipped me.

1:30:23.687 --> 1:30:25.940
"Oh, I just said I won't do that."

1:30:26.106 --> 1:30:32.988
"It's good having ma on your side, right?
It'd be pretty serious if she turned against you."

1:30:33.030 --> 1:30:35.991
"I am the way I am.
If people in this town don't like me,"

1:30:36.033 --> 1:30:38.994
then there is nothing I can do about that.

1:30:39.828 --> 1:30:42.414
I feel bad I need to be punished.

1:30:42.539 --> 1:30:45.917
"The fact is, I wouldn't have any respect
for you if you don't give me a spanking."

1:30:45.959 --> 1:30:48.920
I don't care how much fun you think it would be.

1:30:48.962 --> 1:30:51.714
"I'm not gonna spank you, Jason."

1:30:52.715 --> 1:30:59.263
"In that case, when Ma gets home
maybe I'll just have to tell her you hit me."

1:30:59.388 --> 1:31:00.890
But I just said that I wouldn't!

1:31:00.890 --> 1:31:03.517
I reckon Ma'll take my word for it.

1:31:04.852 --> 1:31:08.314
"If you give me that spanking,
nobody's ever have to know."

1:31:14.111 --> 1:31:17.072
Stop it. Get away from Achilles.
Stop it.

1:31:17.948 --> 1:31:22.202
I gave his crib a shove.
It's not my fault it didn't tip over.

1:31:22.244 --> 1:31:25.080
Don't you touch him.
Move away from the crib.

1:31:25.163 --> 1:31:27.540
"Stop it, Jason. Stop it!"

1:31:27.665 --> 1:31:29.584
All right. You want a spanking.
I'll give you a spanking...

1:31:29.626 --> 1:31:31.753
Come here.
Come here!

1:31:34.380 --> 1:31:37.550
- There! There we go.
- That wasn't hard.

1:31:37.884 --> 1:31:40.720
It's gotta be hard or it isn't punishment.

1:31:40.928 --> 1:31:43.472
- All right.
- Harder!

1:31:45.766 --> 1:31:48.477
"Oh, this is... come on.
All right, that's enough."

1:31:48.644 --> 1:31:49.895
That is enough punishment now.

1:31:49.979 --> 1:31:53.565
Maybe I should go stand in the corner
and be ashamed?

1:31:53.607 --> 1:31:57.069
I don't care.. Stand in the corner.
Do whatever you gotta do.

1:31:57.194 --> 1:31:58.779
"Hey, there is Pa!"

1:32:01.990 --> 1:32:05.202
He's early. I hope there is nothing wrong.

1:32:05.243 --> 1:32:12.792
"[Narrator] Just as Dogville had done from
its open, frail shelf on the mountainside,
quite unprotected from any capricious storms,"

1:32:12.917 --> 1:32:15.795
"Grace, too, had laid herself open."

1:32:16.713 --> 1:32:22.093
And there she dangled from her frail stalk
like the apple in the Garden of Eden.

1:32:22.468 --> 1:32:26.305
An apple so swollen that the juices almost ran.

1:32:28.140 --> 1:32:32.227
And once again the police
had come to Dogville.

1:32:34.146 --> 1:32:39.776
"I said I'd tell you, to save Martha
the confusion about the ringing. But I forgot."

1:32:39.818 --> 1:32:41.737
They're already down by Canyon Road.

1:32:41.737 --> 1:32:45.031
The fellow in the other car is from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1:32:45.073 --> 1:32:47.075
- You forgot!
- Yah.

1:32:47.867 --> 1:32:49.869
"It is the busy time for the apples,
you know."

1:32:49.869 --> 1:32:50.870
The FBI?

1:32:51.746 --> 1:32:55.542
"They were most interested in hearing
what I'd seen in the past six months,"

1:32:55.792 --> 1:32:58.378
anything related to that wanted poster.

1:32:58.753 --> 1:33:04.342
They asked me if I'd seen any signs
in the woods of anyone camping out there.

1:33:04.467 --> 1:33:07.261
God only knows
what that woman's capable of.

1:33:07.345 --> 1:33:09.430
"You know, she is not capable of anything."

1:33:09.430 --> 1:33:15.436
"Well, that's what you say.
But it sure didn't sound that way coming from the laws."

1:33:17.146 --> 1:33:19.648
That's why I felt I had to tell 'em
what I knew.

1:33:22.359 --> 1:33:24.027
What did you tell them?

1:33:24.569 --> 1:33:27.489
"Well, I thought I'd seen something
in the woods recently."

1:33:27.948 --> 1:33:30.408
An item of clothing to be exact.

1:33:30.575 --> 1:33:33.661
It turned out that it was just
an old hat Tom had lost.

1:33:33.995 --> 1:33:36.873
- But it could've been this.
-  Chuck.. give me..

1:33:36.873 --> 1:33:41.502
"Expensive, by the feel of it,
and your initials on it."

1:33:44.714 --> 1:33:48.384
I imagine they'd draw the same conclusion
from this as anybody would.

1:33:48.384 --> 1:33:53.139
I told the law it'd take me no time at all
to find this piece of clothing.

1:33:54.014 --> 1:33:59.353
"I reckon we got us ten minutes, maybe fifteen,
'fore they start knocking on doors."

1:33:59.603 --> 1:34:04.191
I wouldn't try to run away.
They are sure to see you.

1:34:04.483 --> 1:34:06.318
"Why would I wanna run away, Chuck?"

1:34:06.443 --> 1:34:08.278
"I wouldn't try to holler, either."

1:34:08.278 --> 1:34:10.197
Why would I wanna do that?

1:34:10.322 --> 1:34:12.365
It wasn't me who wanted you here.

1:34:12.449 --> 1:34:15.076
You were far to beautiful and frail
for this place.

1:34:16.619 --> 1:34:19.205
You tricked me into feeling that
I meant something to you.

1:34:19.289 --> 1:34:21.791
"It's your own damn fault.
I need your respect, Grace."

1:34:22.333 --> 1:34:25.545
- You have my respect.
- I want your respect.

1:34:25.670 --> 1:34:26.337
Don't...!

1:34:40.559 --> 1:34:42.519
This is wrong..

1:34:44.188 --> 1:34:49.901
"If I can force the flowers to bloom
early in spring, I can force you..."

1:34:51.027 --> 1:34:52.571
Please...

1:35:02.580 --> 1:35:07.627
"Stop it!
Please.. Please... Please, don't!"

1:35:07.835 --> 1:35:10.504
Please! Please...

1:35:11.088 --> 1:35:14.216
"Please look at me, talk to me."

1:35:14.508 --> 1:35:18.179
"We're friends, you and my family.."

1:35:21.849 --> 1:35:23.434
Stop it!

1:36:22.615 --> 1:36:24.325
Have you seen Grace?

1:36:24.993 --> 1:36:26.578
She's at my place.

1:36:27.036 --> 1:36:30.498
- Is she busy?
- Not anymore. Go right in.

1:36:55.605 --> 1:37:02.195
[Narrator] Yet again Grace had made
a miraculous escape from her pursuers
with the aid of the people of Dogville.

1:37:02.779 --> 1:37:07.325
"Everyone had covered up for her,
including Chuck, who had to admit"

1:37:07.367 --> 1:37:12.747
that it was probably Tom's hat he'd
mistakenly considered so suspicious.

1:37:27.803 --> 1:37:32.724
"That evening Tom had sensed at once
that something had taken place,"

1:37:32.724 --> 1:37:37.229
but had to plead with Grace for ages
before she finally broke down

1:37:37.437 --> 1:37:40.148
and unburdened herself.

1:37:40.190 --> 1:37:42.359
- I have to confront him. I mean.
- No!

1:37:42.484 --> 1:37:44.194
- I have no other choice.
- No.

1:37:44.277 --> 1:37:47.280
- No one will accept what he did to you. No one.
- I don't want you to.

1:37:47.405 --> 1:37:53.619
I came here with all these ideas
and these stupid prejudices.

1:37:56.497 --> 1:38:00.042
"He is not strong, Tom."

1:38:00.042 --> 1:38:02.545
"He looks strong, but he's not."

1:38:04.422 --> 1:38:07.883
I'm gonna start looking for a way
to get you out of here.

1:38:20.645 --> 1:38:22.814
[Narrator] The end of the summer had come.

1:38:22.939 --> 1:38:30.280
And in Elm Street the second clutch of
Dogville's scatty squirrels scooted in and out
of the legs of children and grown-ups alike

1:38:30.405 --> 1:38:34.367
searching in vain for Elm Street's non-existent elms.

1:38:35.952 --> 1:38:42.291
"The heat had turned the soil among the gooseberry
bushes to stone, but Grace did not complain."

1:38:42.333 --> 1:38:44.543
"She threw herself into her work,"

1:38:44.585 --> 1:38:49.131
happy that it was something you could
actually grasp between your fingers.

1:38:50.090 --> 1:38:51.508
"Hey, Liz!
Hey, Vera!"

1:38:51.592 --> 1:38:54.928
"Better watch out, Grace.
Vera's got it in for you today."

1:38:55.888 --> 1:38:57.764
What are you talking about?

1:38:59.266 --> 1:39:01.768
Maybe you thought he wouldn't tell me?

1:39:04.729 --> 1:39:05.856
Who?

1:39:07.357 --> 1:39:09.651
You hit Jason.

1:39:11.778 --> 1:39:13.029
I did.

1:39:13.404 --> 1:39:15.823
How could you do such a thing?

1:39:16.616 --> 1:39:20.953
"I know it sounds implausible,
but he was asking for it."

1:39:21.496 --> 1:39:24.790
"It's true, Vera. He's always asking for it."

1:39:26.792 --> 1:39:29.628
I should have done that myself
a long time ago.

1:39:30.171 --> 1:39:32.506
"- Liz!
- It's your fault, the way you've spoiled him."

1:39:32.631 --> 1:39:38.679
"I know how much you love him,
Vera. So do I..."

1:39:39.012 --> 1:39:42.975
It won't happen again.
It really won't.

1:39:43.100 --> 1:39:47.854
"No. I know it won't, because I'll
never leave them with you again."

1:39:48.605 --> 1:39:51.316
That'd be far too dangerous
for any child of mine.

1:39:51.399 --> 1:39:52.859
I've been tired.

1:39:52.901 --> 1:39:58.364
"Well, maybe you should see about
sleeping at night, like most folks do."

1:39:58.489 --> 1:39:59.866
Sleeping at night?

1:40:01.617 --> 1:40:10.668
Martha saw a certain Tom Edison Jr.
sneak out of her shed early this morning.

1:40:15.589 --> 1:40:18.967
"Grace, you won't hear anything from me
about whipping that idiot kid."

1:40:19.301 --> 1:40:23.513
And I'm also grateful to you for turning
Tom's wandering eye away from my skirts.

1:40:24.222 --> 1:40:27.017
"But on the other hand, I'd expected
more from you than that."

1:40:29.436 --> 1:40:32.814
"But if that's the kind of thing you're after,
then I'm sure, with your innocent look,"

1:40:32.856 --> 1:40:35.650
you will do just fine
in a place like Dogville.

1:40:35.734 --> 1:40:38.153
"- It's not what I'm after, Liz.
- Oh, no?"

1:40:38.278 --> 1:40:42.990
We all saw you take his hand to the picnic.
Maybe that wasn't flirting?

1:40:45.118 --> 1:40:48.829
Yes... Maybe I was flirting..

1:40:57.880 --> 1:41:04.178
[Narrator] Next day the weather changed.
The fog came rolling down from the mountains.

1:41:04.386 --> 1:41:10.725
"And althought there were no sunsets to be seen,
McKay thought it best that she sat by him anyway."

1:41:11.059 --> 1:41:14.562
"She had sat by Jack McKay so many times now,"

1:41:14.688 --> 1:41:18.858
but Jack had not got better
at judging the distance between them.

1:41:19.067 --> 1:41:23.946
"On the contrary, where fingers alone
had previously brushed her young flesh,"

1:41:24.030 --> 1:41:29.327
now it was a and that remained in place
throughout the allotted span.

1:41:31.829 --> 1:41:36.459
"The hour in the orchard were long now,
for the harvest was under way."

1:41:36.584 --> 1:41:42.589
"And Grace had long since given up arguing
with Chuck's perception that respect for cultivation,"

1:41:42.631 --> 1:41:47.970
"harvest, and fruit could be directly
measured in provision of carnality."

1:41:49.262 --> 1:41:54.351
"Though reluctant to leave Grace alone,
Tom wantered around quite often now,"

1:41:54.434 --> 1:41:58.938
lost in thought as he tried to crack
the problem of possible escape.

1:41:59.773 --> 1:42:05.445
"And as Grace's wages no longer found
their way to her purse he had stepped in,"

1:42:05.486 --> 1:42:12.451
and together they had triumphantly picked up
the last of the seven figurines
from Ma Ginger's windows.

1:42:22.336 --> 1:42:23.879
What's the matter?

1:42:24.963 --> 1:42:28.675
- Nothing.
- Are the police on Canyon Road again?

1:42:30.010 --> 1:42:36.892
No. This is just girl talk.

1:42:37.517 --> 1:42:41.563
"It's funny you should mention Canyon Road,
though... right, Martha?"

1:42:41.646 --> 1:42:44.482
- She was just there this morning.
- Yeah.

1:42:44.524 --> 1:42:48.444
"- On the way home from church...
- You see so much more on foot, you know."

1:42:48.528 --> 1:42:53.741
"When you're in a car you never notice
the apple orchard, for example."

1:42:56.535 --> 1:43:00.956
You can only see it from one spot
on Canyon Road.

1:43:01.373 --> 1:43:05.002
"- Do you know that spot, Martha?
- Yes I do."

1:43:06.670 --> 1:43:11.258
And did you stop there to enjoy
the view this morning?

1:43:11.383 --> 1:43:14.970
"It's harvest time, you know,
in the orchard after all."

1:43:15.095 --> 1:43:18.557
The old masters always loved
a good harvest theme.

1:43:18.598 --> 1:43:27.524
"Redolent, with fertility, not to mention
sensibility or even eroticism."

1:43:30.735 --> 1:43:36.157
"But how silly of me to ask you that, Martha,
because you already said you did."

1:43:39.535 --> 1:43:41.829
"She saw you, Grace.."

1:43:46.292 --> 1:43:49.336
She saw you..

1:43:51.588 --> 1:43:54.883
behind this pile of broken limbs..

1:43:56.468 --> 1:43:58.011
with Chuck...

1:44:01.681 --> 1:44:05.977
He said it wasn't the first time
you'd made advances towards him.

1:44:07.604 --> 1:44:12.066
He never told me before because
he wanted to spare my feelings.

1:44:13.693 --> 1:44:18.906
"He's a withdrawn and primitive man,"

1:44:21.659 --> 1:44:26.789
but at heart he's loyal
and he is good.

1:44:26.830 --> 1:44:30.167
What do you want with my husband?

1:44:31.585 --> 1:44:40.844
I don't want anything with
your husband or anybody.

1:44:40.886 --> 1:44:43.555
What about Tom and the hand-holding
at the picnic?

1:44:44.180 --> 1:44:46.558
That's different. I like Tom.

1:44:48.393 --> 1:44:50.562
But you don't like Chuck.

1:44:50.645 --> 1:44:56.317
"Liz and Martha are behind me, when I tell you
that I'm going to have to teach you a lesson."

1:44:56.317 --> 1:44:59.028
I believe in education.

1:45:02.990 --> 1:45:03.658
Vera!

1:45:03.991 --> 1:45:09.038
No. I believe smashing them is
less a crime than making them.

1:45:10.914 --> 1:45:14.918
Vera.. remember how I taught your children..

1:45:15.043 --> 1:45:18.922
"- What?
- Remember how happy you were, when I..."

1:45:19.089 --> 1:45:22.843
- When you what?
- When I taught your children
about the doctrine of stoicism

1:45:22.926 --> 1:45:25.136
and they finally understood it.

1:45:27.055 --> 1:45:29.391
"All right.. For that, I'm gonna be lenient."

1:45:29.391 --> 1:45:33.061
"I'm going to break two of your figurines first,"

1:45:35.772 --> 1:45:45.364
"and if you can demonstrate your knowledge
of the doctrine of stoicism by holding back your tears,"

1:45:45.698 --> 1:45:50.536
I'll stop.
Have you got that?

1:46:03.882 --> 1:46:09.179
"[Narrator] In her lifetime Grace had
considerable practice at constraining her emotions,"

1:46:09.179 --> 1:46:13.141
and would never have believed
it would be hard to control them now.

1:46:14.350 --> 1:46:21.649
But as the porcelain pulverized on the floor
it was as if it were human tissue disintegrating.

1:46:23.317 --> 1:46:28.072
The figurines were the offspring of
the meeting between the
township and her.

1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:34.995
"They were the proof that in spite of everything,
her suffering had created something of value."

1:46:35.746 --> 1:46:38.415
Grace could not longer cope.

1:46:39.625 --> 1:46:45.172
"For the first time since her childhood,
she wept."

1:47:14.617 --> 1:47:21.915
"Grace went to see Tom that very night,
and informed him that she was ready
to follow his advice and leave the township."

1:47:22.916 --> 1:47:29.214
"And since Tom had just made up his mind
that a third party would be needed
to ensure the success of an escape,"

1:47:29.423 --> 1:47:33.260
they agreed that Ben possessed
the greatest potential.

1:47:34.594 --> 1:47:38.515
"But it was a case where money
was required, Tom concluded,"

1:47:38.723 --> 1:47:45.605
"and estimated, that considering the times and all,
ten dollars would suffice for Ben and his truck."

1:47:45.688 --> 1:47:48.816
- But we don't have ten dollars.
- No. We borrow it.

1:47:50.735 --> 1:47:53.279
- From whom?
- From Dad.

1:47:54.155 --> 1:47:56.532
He has more than that in the medicine closet.

1:47:56.615 --> 1:47:59.201
I talk to him in the morning and arrange a loan.

1:47:59.952 --> 1:48:01.620
But you have a word with Ben...

1:48:01.745 --> 1:48:04.498
"It's the end of the week,
he's bound to be flat broke."

1:48:05.958 --> 1:48:08.543
Tell your father that I will pay him back.

1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:10.379
Of course.

1:48:15.091 --> 1:48:16.217
Thank you.

1:48:19.804 --> 1:48:23.266
You are always rescuing me.

1:48:27.061 --> 1:48:30.189
I can't believe that you go on
being there for me.

1:48:32.984 --> 1:48:34.026
Good night..

1:48:37.196 --> 1:48:38.739
You should get some sleep.

1:48:47.956 --> 1:48:50.792
[Narrator] Grace went to see Ben next morning.

1:48:55.088 --> 1:48:58.967
"When Grace presented the payment
as compensation between friends,"

1:48:58.967 --> 1:49:01.386
"Ben did not object too heartily,"

1:49:01.428 --> 1:49:07.016
considering the trouble he could receive
from the rest of the towns-people
when they realized what had happened.

1:49:07.183 --> 1:49:10.520
"Perhaps they'd all be relieved
that she was out of their lives,"

1:49:10.937 --> 1:49:14.398
but somehow Grace wasn't too sure of that.

1:49:15.024 --> 1:49:21.739
"Ben agreed to drive her, even though he wasn't
out to profit from other folks' misfortunes, as he put it."

1:49:21.739 --> 1:49:25.784
- I don't wanna profit from other folks' misfortunes.
- No..

1:49:25.868 --> 1:49:30.581
[Narrator] The fact was that Ben would have driven
to the gates of Hell and back for ten dollars

1:49:30.831 --> 1:49:34.960
And the criminal aspect bugged him less
than Grace would ever have guessed;

1:49:35.043 --> 1:49:38.463
he had freighted all kinds of things
in his day.

1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:42.384
The plan was for Grace to hide
among the apples.

1:49:42.509 --> 1:49:47.513
"Knowing the exact time to harvest is the
greatest art of all, Chuck had said,"

1:49:47.722 --> 1:49:52.685
and the time had come
for the apples and for Grace.

1:49:52.685 --> 1:49:54.687
"Grace, where've you been?"

1:49:54.812 --> 1:49:58.774
If I'd displayed the same indifference
to the timing of my chores I'd be in for a whippin'

1:49:58.816 --> 1:50:00.317
Now get a move on!

1:50:01.110 --> 1:50:04.905
"I'm sorry, Olivia.
I had to talk to Ben about something."

1:50:04.989 --> 1:50:06.323
June is near to bursting.

1:50:06.448 --> 1:50:09.118
"She can't use the pot on her own,
as you well know."

1:50:09.118 --> 1:50:12.996
It ain't fittin' to toy with her just 'cause
she's crippled and can't help herself.

1:50:17.334 --> 1:50:25.508
"[Narrator] The evening before the escape
Tom tactically thought it best not to press
his desires of the flesh too hard upon Grace,"

1:50:25.717 --> 1:50:30.096
and instead he adopted a more
sensitive approach.

1:50:32.015 --> 1:50:38.312
But there is a right and a wrong time
to plant seeds and you can't plant seeds in the winter.

1:50:39.563 --> 1:50:43.651
That's true.
But I love you...

1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:46.654
- I know.
- And you love me

1:50:46.987 --> 1:50:49.990
and we will meet again in love
and in freedom.

1:50:50.074 --> 1:50:51.867
Absolutely.

1:50:52.910 --> 1:50:56.872
"I shouldn't be ashamed wanting you, should I?
It's nothing to be ashamed of."

1:50:56.872 --> 1:50:58.123
No...

1:50:59.374 --> 1:51:03.044
- No.
- No.. no. It's lovely. It's lovely that we want each other.

1:51:05.046 --> 1:51:07.382
- But not this way.
- No.

1:51:07.716 --> 1:51:09.509
It's not right.

1:51:20.519 --> 1:51:25.316
"[Narrator] The next morning, when Grace
wanted to slip down to Ben's as invisibly as possible,"

1:51:25.441 --> 1:51:30.446
it seemed to Grace that the entire township
was up and about at the same time.

1:51:31.113 --> 1:51:33.490
"- Grace!
- Yes, Vera.."

1:51:33.740 --> 1:51:39.037
"If you think that by hitting my child you can
get out of working for me, think again."

1:51:39.162 --> 1:51:40.956
"Why don't you just come by as planned,"

1:51:40.956 --> 1:51:46.002
and we'll find something
where you won't be able to harm anyone.

1:51:46.127 --> 1:51:49.047
- At twelve o'clock?
- Yes.

1:51:49.214 --> 1:51:52.926
Why are you taking your copious
belongings around with you?

1:51:53.134 --> 1:51:55.094
Afraid you are gonna loose them?

1:51:55.303 --> 1:51:58.264
"Grace, Ben's hauling apples today
so we won't be loading glasses."

1:51:58.598 --> 1:52:02.476
But that don't mean you're off work.
Dad wants you to repack the whole last load.

1:52:03.185 --> 1:52:05.646
Maybe you can do it better
and we'll have an extra crate.

1:52:06.188 --> 1:52:10.734
"An old crate like that may not have much
value in your eyes, but this is Dogville."

1:52:11.026 --> 1:52:12.861
We're not wealthy here.

1:52:13.862 --> 1:52:17.950
"And if your hands get a bit red, well,
I've got a tip about something you can rub on 'em."

1:52:18.033 --> 1:52:21.078
"- Grace!
- Oh, Martha.."

1:52:23.413 --> 1:52:25.999
We have to wash the flagstones
at the foot of the steps again.

1:52:26.082 --> 1:52:28.793
Dirt has gone blown under the door.
I can't get the door open.

1:52:28.835 --> 1:52:34.048
Where have you been?
Harvest is the holiest time of the year.

1:52:34.632 --> 1:52:36.926
Does it not sound like something
you could have said?

1:52:37.802 --> 1:52:43.015
"I'll be down in a minute, Chuck.
I'll bring the crates down."

1:52:43.683 --> 1:52:44.559
Good.

1:52:45.351 --> 1:52:47.561
"[Narrator] As Grace hastened to the garage,"

1:52:47.687 --> 1:52:53.025
she grew more and more pleased with
the decision to keep her departure under wrap.

1:52:54.068 --> 1:52:58.405
There was actually quite a bit of work
Dogville didn't need doing

1:52:58.447 --> 1:53:02.618
that its residents would have to carry out
for themselves in future.

1:53:03.702 --> 1:53:09.082
"Yeah, er, Grace, I don't like having to say this,
but I'd like to ask if I could have the money up front."

1:53:09.791 --> 1:53:12.794
"See, it's always the way in the freight industry."

1:53:12.836 --> 1:53:17.382
"Once you deliver a load you ain't got much
to bargain with, if you catch my drift."

1:53:17.465 --> 1:53:19.342
Of course. Here's the money.

1:53:19.425 --> 1:53:22.428
"Not that this is a professional job,
of course."

1:53:22.470 --> 1:53:24.263
"- Don't get out...
- All right, Ben."

1:53:24.847 --> 1:53:25.973
'till I give the say-so!

1:53:47.202 --> 1:53:53.124
"[Narrator] Canyon Road snaked down the valley
and away, and Grace went too,"

1:53:53.458 --> 1:54:00.590
and with every bend the township and its noises
faded ever more mercifully behind her.

1:54:49.887 --> 1:54:51.764
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah.

1:54:52.431 --> 1:54:55.810
There are a hell lot of.. a lot of police up ahead.

1:54:57.478 --> 1:54:59.396
I wasn't expecting that.

1:55:00.773 --> 1:55:05.986
It's more dangerous than I thought.
We'll have to go back.

1:55:08.030 --> 1:55:09.948
No! we can't do that.

1:55:11.742 --> 1:55:12.784
It's just....

1:55:13.118 --> 1:55:20.125
"if this was a professional transport job,
you know, paid proper like...it'd be a lot easier, but..."

1:55:22.335 --> 1:55:24.254
But it's been paid for...

1:55:24.712 --> 1:55:32.511
"Yeah, but, in the freight industry carrying
dangerous load it cost more."

1:55:33.512 --> 1:55:35.890
"A surcharge, they call it."

1:55:37.016 --> 1:55:42.980
"If this were a professional job,
I could just charge you."

1:55:45.482 --> 1:55:48.193
"But Bun, I don't have any more money."

1:55:53.365 --> 1:55:55.992
"Oh, that's no good then."

1:56:00.121 --> 1:56:07.337
"You said once, you said once,
that there aren't many pleasures in my life."

1:56:10.298 --> 1:56:13.426
"And you know, I go to Miss Laura
once a week."

1:56:14.844 --> 1:56:21.851
And you got me to see that it weren't
nothing to be ashamed of.

1:56:26.522 --> 1:56:29.316
I was gonna go there tonight...

1:56:31.818 --> 1:56:35.697
and of course it costs me.

1:56:37.532 --> 1:56:41.786
"I mean, not as much as..."

1:56:43.621 --> 1:56:51.462
"not as much as a surcharge
for dangerous goods, but  still..."

1:56:54.173 --> 1:56:56.175
"it does cost me, you know."

1:56:56.884 --> 1:56:59.553
"No, Ben, no... please don't.."

1:57:00.096 --> 1:57:04.391
"It's not personal, Grace.
It's not personal. I just..."

1:57:06.143 --> 1:57:08.937
"I have to take due payment, that's all."

1:57:09.855 --> 1:57:12.983
I don't .. I don't have a choice.

1:57:13.859 --> 1:57:17.070
I can't buck the freight in this big craft.

1:57:20.615 --> 1:57:26.287
We're parked in the square in Georgetown.
Right outside the church.

1:57:27.622 --> 1:57:29.791
You'd better keep your voice down.

1:57:33.961 --> 1:57:35.546
"No, Ben..."

1:57:35.630 --> 1:57:41.344
"This ain't somethin' I'm proud of, Grace.
Don't go thinking that."

1:58:14.125 --> 1:58:22.383
"[Narrator] Grace fell asleep on the long highway,
thanks to her healthy ability to push
any unpleasantness around her far away."

1:58:22.425 --> 1:58:27.596
"A generous God had blessed her with
the rare talent of being able to look ahead,"

1:58:28.055 --> 1:58:30.057
and only ahead.

1:58:31.642 --> 1:58:38.523
"And later when the truck slowed down
about to reach its destination and she slowly
returned to consciousness,"

1:58:38.565 --> 1:58:42.194
she had no way of knowing how long she had slept.

1:58:42.235 --> 1:58:47.115
All she knew was that she would be
happy to see the light of day again.

1:58:49.617 --> 1:58:52.078
And then she heard the dog.

1:58:57.875 --> 1:59:01.379
All your fondness for apples seems
less and less believable.

1:59:02.213 --> 1:59:03.673
You've bruised 'em.

1:59:16.518 --> 1:59:19.521
We had a meeting last night
at the mission house.

1:59:21.898 --> 1:59:25.235
"They said you might be going to try to run away,"

1:59:25.318 --> 1:59:29.906
"so when I discovered you'd hidden
yourself away on my truck,"

1:59:31.324 --> 1:59:34.702
I didn't have no choice but
to bring you back to Dogville.

1:59:36.454 --> 1:59:39.415
In the freight industry we can't take sides.

2:00:23.750 --> 2:00:28.879
"[Narrator] It didn't help Grace that the first theft
ever registered in Dogville had taken place
the previous evening,"

2:00:28.921 --> 2:00:33.259
when most people were assembled
for the town meeting.

2:00:33.717 --> 2:00:39.098
Old Tom Edison Senior had a considerable
sum of money stolen from his medicine closet

2:00:39.139 --> 2:00:41.725
"and suspicion soon fell on Grace,"

2:00:41.725 --> 2:00:46.730
who had apparently been planning an escape
that would surely require funding.

2:00:47.105 --> 2:00:51.568
Grace chose to remain silent
in the face of these new charges.

2:00:52.944 --> 2:00:58.908
"And then Bill, who had lately improved his
engineering skills to an astonishing degree,"

2:00:59.159 --> 2:01:04.706
"had, by way of his first design, implemented
a kind of escape prevention mechanism."

2:01:05.123 --> 2:01:11.087
"Beautiful it might not have been,
but effective he dared say it was."

2:01:22.139 --> 2:01:26.602
"Grace, we don't like having to do this."

2:01:27.394 --> 2:01:32.149
We don't have much of a choice
if we are to protect our community.

2:01:32.482 --> 2:01:36.778
Could you... Do you mind moving?
Try moving.

2:01:57.006 --> 2:01:58.132
It works.

2:01:59.341 --> 2:02:05.681
We had to make this heavy enough so that
it can only move where the ground's level.

2:02:05.848 --> 2:02:09.226
And the ground is level in town.

2:02:14.439 --> 2:02:16.399
May I go now?

2:02:22.155 --> 2:02:25.658
I have to figure out
how I'm going to get into my house.

2:02:27.827 --> 2:02:31.497
"Or is that part of the punishment,
having to sleep outdoors?"

2:02:31.956 --> 2:02:34.584
"No, no no Grace."

2:02:34.625 --> 2:02:38.796
Don't think of this as punishment.
Not at all!

2:02:39.797 --> 2:02:44.885
"Bill, he made the chain long enough
so that you can sleep in your bed."

2:02:55.896 --> 2:02:57.439
"Grace, six o'clock."

2:03:00.734 --> 2:03:03.028
"Yes, Mrs. Henson."

2:03:31.722 --> 2:03:34.016
I couldn't run the risk of Dad turning me down.

2:03:34.057 --> 2:03:36.810
"But, they think it was me that took the money."

2:03:37.728 --> 2:03:39.771
'Cause I told them so.

2:03:43.858 --> 2:03:45.694
You did what?

2:03:46.361 --> 2:03:49.447
"First they suspected me, but then
I convinced them that it was you,"

2:03:49.489 --> 2:03:52.241
since you were the one
using the medicine closet.

2:03:53.701 --> 2:03:54.619
Why?

2:03:55.161 --> 2:03:57.038
Because I'm here to do the thinking for you.

2:03:57.079 --> 2:04:01.417
"If we are to have the slightest chance
of getting you out of
here,"

2:04:02.752 --> 2:04:05.629
they can never know how close we really are.

2:04:07.256 --> 2:04:10.843
They can't know I'm trying to help you.

2:04:13.011 --> 2:04:17.182
"If they knew it was me that took the money,
I wouldn't be here talking to you now."

2:04:20.185 --> 2:04:22.729
"Please don't disappear, Tom."

2:04:28.735 --> 2:04:30.445
I need you.

2:04:33.531 --> 2:04:36.951
I'll break this one...
with some thinking.

2:04:47.002 --> 2:04:54.510
"[Narrator] It was not Grace's pride that kept
her going during the days when fall came
and the trees were losing their leaves,"

2:04:54.551 --> 2:04:59.931
"but more of the trance-like state that descends
on animals whose lives are threatened,"

2:04:59.931 --> 2:05:04.311
"a state in which the body reacts mechanically,
in a low, tough gear,"

2:05:04.311 --> 2:05:07.355
without too much painful reflection.

2:05:07.397 --> 2:05:12.068
Like a patient passively letting
his disease hold sway.

2:05:13.111 --> 2:05:20.576
"And now that Vera had received proof that it was
in fact Chuck who'd forced his attentions on Grace,"

2:05:20.618 --> 2:05:22.954
she was meaner than ever.

2:05:26.332 --> 2:05:31.837
"Had Grace had friends in Dogville
they, too, fell like the leaves."

2:05:33.422 --> 2:05:40.387
The most towns-people of the male sex now
visited Grace at night to fulfill their sexual needs.

2:05:41.805 --> 2:05:44.683
It had occurred to the children
to give the bell an extra ring

2:05:44.766 --> 2:05:50.397
"every time such an act had been consummated,
much to Martha's confusion."

2:05:52.524 --> 2:05:57.487
But since the chain had been attached
things had become easier for everyone:

2:05:58.988 --> 2:06:02.825
"the harassments in bed did not have to be
kept so secret anymore,"

2:06:02.825 --> 2:06:06.412
because they couldn't really be
compared to a sexual act.

2:06:06.495 --> 2:06:11.417
"They were embarrassing in the way it is
when a hillbilly has his way with a cow,"

2:06:11.459 --> 2:06:12.918
but no more than that.

2:06:14.962 --> 2:06:16.839
Tom saw everything.

2:06:16.880 --> 2:06:22.219
"It pained him, and the sexual visits
were a particularly severe blow."

2:06:28.975 --> 2:06:34.397
"But he supported her as best he could,
the way a spider supports,"

2:06:34.439 --> 2:06:38.151
when it has been tangled
in its own web by the wind.

2:06:39.193 --> 2:06:40.278
Tom!

2:06:47.159 --> 2:06:50.037
Everything I tried to do went wrong.

2:06:51.163 --> 2:06:54.458
I can't come up with the answe
I was looking for.

2:06:54.500 --> 2:06:59.254
"You'll come up with it, you'll see.
You're very clever."

2:07:00.881 --> 2:07:05.886
- We provoked them.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

2:07:10.932 --> 2:07:14.769
We provoked them.
Now it is time for us to provoke ourselves.

2:07:14.853 --> 2:07:16.104
What do you mean?

2:07:16.146 --> 2:07:20.900
"I mean, by showing them some trust."

2:07:20.984 --> 2:07:25.363
"It all started with a meeting, so it will be
logical to end it with
one, too."

2:07:25.613 --> 2:07:29.825
You'll talk and they'll listen.
They can't refuse to listen.

2:07:31.869 --> 2:07:35.539
- What will I say?
- Everything. You'll say everything.

2:07:35.623 --> 2:07:38.542
"- Everything?
- Yeah, the truth. The Truth."

2:07:38.542 --> 2:07:41.211
Just the truth about each and
every one of them.

2:07:41.211 --> 2:07:43.464
I don't think they are gonna want to hear that.

2:07:43.464 --> 2:07:49.511
"I know, I know. It is like a child
who doesn't want to take his medicine."

2:07:50.929 --> 2:07:56.476
"They'll be furious at first, but in the end
they'll see it is for their own good."

2:07:56.518 --> 2:08:00.396
Just don't be hateful. Don't be reproving.

2:08:01.689 --> 2:08:04.317
"If anybody can do it,
Grace, you can."

2:08:05.109 --> 2:08:12.658
They'll all realize that this weapon and
this understanding and injustice
has only one true victim and that's you.

2:08:12.908 --> 2:08:16.704
And from there it is only
one small step to forgiveness.

2:08:17.872 --> 2:08:23.002
"You've done some hard thinking, Tom Edison."

2:08:23.752 --> 2:08:28.590
I'm sure it is an excellent plan.
I'm sure.

2:08:47.984 --> 2:08:53.239
"[Narrator] If forgiveness was close at hand
in the mission house, they were all hiding it well."

2:08:54.699 --> 2:08:57.535
It hadn't been easy for Tom to get them there.

2:08:58.077 --> 2:09:04.124
Appealing to consciences stowed farther
and farther away by their owners every day

2:09:04.249 --> 2:09:10.589
"as if they were as fragile as Henson's
glasses after polishing, had proved quite a task."

2:09:11.256 --> 2:09:15.218
"But if one was going, the others
might as well come along, too,"

2:09:15.260 --> 2:09:18.096
so nobody could talk behind anybody's back.

2:09:20.265 --> 2:09:23.727
Tom had set the scene for Grace's speech.

2:09:24.102 --> 2:09:29.649
"Now she'd have to sink or swim,
and sincerity be brought to bear."

2:09:31.401 --> 2:09:36.197
While Grace addressed the silent congregation
in the mission house on Elm Street

2:09:36.239 --> 2:09:40.451
the first of the early autumn snowstorms
embraced the town.

2:09:41.035 --> 2:09:47.374
The snowflakes dusted down over the old
buildings as if this were just any old town.

2:09:47.750 --> 2:09:51.837
"And they played in the brances and twigs
from which the apples had hung,"

2:09:51.962 --> 2:09:56.717
but luckily the harvest was home and
via the freight industry had found a market

2:09:56.758 --> 2:09:59.928
despite the ever disappointing prices.

2:10:00.178 --> 2:10:03.139
Grace had presented her story with clarity.

2:10:03.139 --> 2:10:06.267
She had not embellished or understated.

2:10:06.267 --> 2:10:11.356
"And just as she finished the snowflakes
all at once stopped tumbling down,"

2:10:12.148 --> 2:10:19.572
"leaving Dogville clad in the daintiest,
whitest blanket of snow imaginable."

2:10:38.090 --> 2:10:40.342
I don't think it went very well.

2:10:40.550 --> 2:10:43.428
It's fine. You did good.

2:10:51.477 --> 2:10:56.065
"[Narrator] The snow had come early,
perhaps too early."

2:10:56.190 --> 2:10:59.527
A misplaced augury of conciliation.

2:11:00.570 --> 2:11:03.364
"Tom looked around, worried:"

2:11:03.406 --> 2:11:07.451
Vera's teeth were clenched.
She was the first to speak.

2:11:07.493 --> 2:11:10.120
Copious lies. Just lies.

2:11:10.162 --> 2:11:14.750
"Yes, Tom. It doesn't accord with the perceptions
I got of this town and its residents."

2:11:15.584 --> 2:11:19.588
"I'm a doctor, damn it, I don't need
anyone to tell me if I'm sick or not."

2:11:19.588 --> 2:11:21.673
"What do you have to say for yourself, Tom?"

2:11:21.882 --> 2:11:24.176
Maybe it's time you picked sides!

2:11:24.801 --> 2:11:27.053
Are you for us or against us?

2:11:27.095 --> 2:11:29.973
Liz is right. We've been
far too indulgent with Tom.

2:11:30.014 --> 2:11:33.726
"Tom, I got to tell you.
Even I have trouble defending that girl."

2:11:34.269 --> 2:11:38.773
"With your help, which I prefer to think
was accidental, Tom,"

2:11:39.398 --> 2:11:46.197
she has managed to spread bitterness
and troubles throughout this whole town.

2:11:46.238 --> 2:11:48.866
"She has to go.
How do we get rid of her, Tom?"

2:11:48.866 --> 2:11:50.451
"So how do we do it, Tom?"

2:11:50.492 --> 2:11:54.872
"I agree, Tom. You brought her in here.
You got to figure out how to get her out."

2:11:54.913 --> 2:11:57.416
Without her lies and accusations spreading.

2:12:00.419 --> 2:12:02.629
I asked you here to listen.

2:12:05.715 --> 2:12:07.842
You only came to defend yourselves.

2:12:08.301 --> 2:12:12.680
I'm sorry
it's quite a blow to me...

2:12:14.015 --> 2:12:21.898
"to see all of my friends act this way,
so uncivilized."

2:13:16.700 --> 2:13:20.412
"Your plan didn't work out very well, did it?"

2:13:21.580 --> 2:13:24.207
"- You'll think of another one.
- No,"

2:13:26.376 --> 2:13:29.421
"No more plans, I promise."

2:13:34.801 --> 2:13:37.887
They asked me to choose between you and them.

2:13:40.098 --> 2:13:43.518
That's not difficult on a day like today.
I love you.

2:13:44.685 --> 2:13:51.525
"You may be stronger, it's true,
but the ideals, the ideals we share."

2:13:52.735 --> 2:13:58.240
You're exhausted. Lie down.

2:14:05.289 --> 2:14:11.044
"I've chosen, Grace.
I have chosen you."

2:14:15.590 --> 2:14:20.470
Now it is the time!
The time we've been waiting for.

2:14:25.516 --> 2:14:28.060
We free ourselves of Dogville.

2:14:34.483 --> 2:14:41.031
"You're right. You're right, Tom.
It'd be so easy to make love right now."

2:14:43.242 --> 2:14:49.122
They may kill us any minute..
It would be the perfect romantic ending.

2:14:49.206 --> 2:14:51.875
I know. I feel it too. I love you.

2:14:55.587 --> 2:14:58.298
"It would be so beautiful, but from ..."

2:14:59.674 --> 2:15:04.429
"from the point of view of our love,
so completely wrong."

2:15:08.599 --> 2:15:11.686
We were to meet in freedom.

2:15:24.406 --> 2:15:26.700
"You're cold now, Grace."

2:15:36.418 --> 2:15:40.880
I've just rejected everybody
I've ever known in your favor.

2:15:43.216 --> 2:15:48.513
"Wouldn't it be worth compromising,
just one of your ideals just a little to ease my pain?"

2:15:51.849 --> 2:15:55.102
"Everybody in this town has
had your body, but me."

2:15:56.187 --> 2:15:58.647
We're the ones supposed to be in love.

2:16:01.609 --> 2:16:03.944
My darling Tom.

2:16:07.656 --> 2:16:10.784
You can have me if you want me.

2:16:13.829 --> 2:16:16.289
Just do what the others do.

2:16:17.666 --> 2:16:19.292
Threaten me...

2:16:19.709 --> 2:16:25.548
"Tell me that you'll turn me in to the law,
to the gangsters and I promise you,"

2:16:26.883 --> 2:16:30.386
you can take whatever it is you want from me.

2:16:31.929 --> 2:16:33.890
I trust you...

2:16:36.350 --> 2:16:40.021
but maybe you don't trust yourself?

2:16:40.646 --> 2:16:47.194
"Perhaps you've been tempted, you've been
tempted to join the others and force me."

2:16:47.194 --> 2:16:50.322
Perhaps that's why you're so upset.

2:16:50.531 --> 2:16:53.116
All I've ever tried to do is help you.

2:16:53.575 --> 2:16:58.330
I'm just asking if you're afraid
that you could be so human.

2:16:58.455 --> 2:17:01.291
"No, I'm not afraid of that.
Not in the least."

2:17:02.626 --> 2:17:04.294
Good.

2:17:08.756 --> 2:17:11.843
Let tomorrow bring that it's gonna bring.

2:17:14.429 --> 2:17:20.101
"It's not a crime to doubt yourself, Tom.."

2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:24.814
but it's wonderful that you don't.

2:17:27.316 --> 2:17:29.360
I can't find the rest.

2:17:32.529 --> 2:17:35.240
Maybe I should go out
for a couple of minutes.

2:17:37.409 --> 2:17:39.870
Take a walk or something...
I don't know.

2:17:42.372 --> 2:17:44.583
To get it all out of my system.

2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:48.962
Trudge the streets..

2:17:49.963 --> 2:17:53.967
Listen to the wind as it passes through
the woods up through the valley

2:17:54.884 --> 2:17:56.427
and all that.

2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:02.308
"You go to sleep, though..."

2:18:06.103 --> 2:18:12.901
You go to sleep
and I will be back very soon.

2:18:20.826 --> 2:18:23.745
[Narrator] Of course it was all a load of nonsense.

2:18:23.829 --> 2:18:29.084
"If anybody was capable of keeping track
of ideals and reality, he was."

2:18:29.209 --> 2:18:34.923
"After all, it was his job.
Moral issues were his home ground."

2:18:35.798 --> 2:18:40.887
To think that he might doubt his own purity
was really to think very little of him.

2:18:41.762 --> 2:18:44.181
Tom was angry.

2:18:46.684 --> 2:18:50.271
"And in the midst of it all,
he discovered why."

2:18:50.938 --> 2:18:54.024
"It was not because of he'd been wrongly accused,"

2:18:54.066 --> 2:18:56.902
but because the charges were true!

2:18:58.445 --> 2:19:04.159
His anger consisted of a most unpleasant
feeling of being found out!

2:19:07.078 --> 2:19:10.332
It was all quite a blow to the young philosopher!

2:19:10.332 --> 2:19:17.088
"And realistically enough, he thought
that if the doubt was already present, it could grow."

2:19:17.130 --> 2:19:23.469
Perhaps so great that one day it would prove
detrimental to his entire moral mission.

2:19:23.719 --> 2:19:25.930
Tom stopped.

2:19:25.972 --> 2:19:31.393
He almost began to shake when the threat
to his career as a writer dawned upon him.

2:19:31.477 --> 2:19:37.232
It didn't take him long to agree with himself
that the risk was too great to run.

2:19:37.232 --> 2:19:41.904
The danger Grace was to the town
she was also to him!

2:19:42.070 --> 2:19:44.239
Tom did not like it.

2:19:44.281 --> 2:19:48.368
And he was man enough
to take action to prevent it.

2:19:50.829 --> 2:19:57.502
Fortunately Tom was as conscientious
as regards his future profession as he was practical.

2:19:57.544 --> 2:20:01.756
"He allowed sincerity and ideals
plenty of room in his life,"

2:20:01.798 --> 2:20:05.635
"without getting ""sentimental"" about it,
as he would put it."

2:20:06.511 --> 2:20:15.477
"Throwing away a document that might be
of significance to Tom and with him future generation
of readers as the basis of a novel or indeed a trilogy,"

2:20:15.644 --> 2:20:19.148
"was not an act he was so stupid to commit,"

2:20:19.148 --> 2:20:24.236
although he had to admit that in a moment
of weakness he might have said he would.

2:20:27.739 --> 2:20:34.454
"Before returning to the meeting that night
Tom opened the little drawer he had open
the night of Grace's arrival,"

2:20:35.205 --> 2:20:37.248
and found it still there:

2:20:37.582 --> 2:20:40.460
the card from the gangster in the car.

2:21:01.730 --> 2:21:05.484
"[Narrator] The next day the sun was shining
in the brisk autumn sky,"

2:21:05.609 --> 2:21:08.111
and the snow was long since gone.

2:21:10.155 --> 2:21:14.409
For the first time for ages the pile driver
could be heard in the marshlands

2:21:14.451 --> 2:21:20.832
as it hammered in the piles for what might
or what might not be a penitentiary.

2:21:20.999 --> 2:21:27.213
"Grace opened her eyes after an almost
unconscious sleep, and was confused."

2:21:27.255 --> 2:21:32.343
"Judging by the light coming through the cracks
in the walls, it had to be nearly midday."

2:21:32.426 --> 2:21:37.640
"The grey hour as Jack McKay
for some reason called noon in Dogville,"

2:21:37.807 --> 2:21:45.064
"being a man of many ideas and proclivities,
quite a few of which Grace would prefer to remain ignorant of."

2:21:45.981 --> 2:21:48.525
But why had nobody roused her?

2:21:48.525 --> 2:21:50.902
Nobody had hammered furiously at her door.

2:21:50.944 --> 2:21:56.199
Not a child had thrown mud into her bed
or broken her remaining windowpanes.

2:21:57.200 --> 2:21:59.536
Now she remembered.

2:21:59.536 --> 2:22:04.874
"She recalled the meeting the previous day,
and puzzled still more."

2:22:05.166 --> 2:22:10.755
Why had she not been confronted with
the outcome of that meeting? Or even killed?

2:22:11.339 --> 2:22:16.010
It was quite unlike Dogville to restrain
its indignation at any point.

2:22:16.218 --> 2:22:19.388
Perhaps things had turned out well after all?

2:22:19.388 --> 2:22:22.766
"- Good morning, Mrs. Henson.
- Oh.. good morning?"

2:22:22.808 --> 2:22:27.813
I would have come earlier. I overslept.

2:22:27.980 --> 2:22:31.358
"Oh, never mind.
Liz put her back into it htis morning."

2:22:32.818 --> 2:22:35.737
We thought some time off would be good for you.

2:22:39.241 --> 2:22:41.493
That was quite a speech you made yesterday.

2:22:41.785 --> 2:22:44.245
It gave us all something to think about.

2:22:48.416 --> 2:22:51.002
"- Hello, Liz!
- Hi, Grace.."

2:22:58.217 --> 2:23:00.511
I overslept.

2:23:01.429 --> 2:23:04.848
- Good morning Miss Grace?
- Good morning..

2:23:04.848 --> 2:23:08.936
- How are you this morning?
- I overslept.

2:23:08.936 --> 2:23:11.063
"Oh, that's all right."

2:23:17.027 --> 2:23:20.614
"Tom. Tom, I think it's Grace."

2:23:21.198 --> 2:23:26.703
"Hello, Grace. Two seconds..
Good news."

2:23:35.294 --> 2:23:37.713
I went back to the meeting last night.

2:23:39.548 --> 2:23:42.385
I wasn't going to let them get off so easily.

2:23:44.220 --> 2:23:47.056
But I'll be damned if the mood hadn't changed.

2:23:48.349 --> 2:23:52.895
"I wouldn't say we won exactly, not exactly,
but I think something very good can come out of this,"

2:23:53.020 --> 2:23:55.188
- something very good.
- Why didn't you come back and tell me?

2:23:55.230 --> 2:23:58.317
"I did, but you were asleep."

2:23:58.775 --> 2:24:01.236
"And you know,
you looked like you needed it.."

2:24:02.487 --> 2:24:05.699
and that made me suggest
that maybe you should have some time off.

2:24:05.740 --> 2:24:10.703
"And you know,
not one single person objected."

2:24:14.916 --> 2:24:16.626
That sounds wonderful.

2:24:16.751 --> 2:24:18.711
"I know it does, doesn't it?"

2:24:19.420 --> 2:24:22.840
The people of this town
they surprise me again and again.

2:24:24.216 --> 2:24:27.720
I might even have to revise
my theories a little bit.

2:24:27.761 --> 2:24:30.264
You know how much I hate
doing that kind of thing.

2:24:32.558 --> 2:24:40.982
"You know, Grace, last night when I came back
and I saw you lying there asleep so sweetly,"

2:24:41.358 --> 2:24:46.780
I was suddenly inspired.
I wrote the first chapter of a story.

2:24:46.905 --> 2:24:49.240
A story about a small town.

2:24:49.824 --> 2:24:51.868
Guess where I got the inspiration?

2:24:52.702 --> 2:24:55.705
But I haven't come up with a name
for the town yet.

2:24:56.873 --> 2:24:59.917
- Why not just call it Dogville?
- Wouldn't work.

2:25:00.668 --> 2:25:05.006
"No, it wouldn't work. It's got to be universal.
Lot of writers make that mistake, you see."

2:25:05.756 --> 2:25:07.925
"Hey, do you want me to read it to you?"

2:25:08.509 --> 2:25:11.095
"If there is any love in it, it comes from you..."

2:25:11.136 --> 2:25:14.056
"Would you be offended, if I said no?"

2:25:15.140 --> 2:25:19.519
"- No.
- If I really do have the day to myself, I..."

2:25:19.853 --> 2:25:22.272
No. No..

2:25:23.732 --> 2:25:28.069
Two people only hurt each other if they
doubt the love they have for one another.

2:25:29.863 --> 2:25:31.865
You can read it some other time.

2:25:33.408 --> 2:25:37.495
You sit down some place
and gaze out at the mountains.

2:25:37.829 --> 2:25:39.914
It's what the girl in my novel does.

2:25:43.292 --> 2:25:46.921
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you. Good news!

2:25:52.384 --> 2:25:57.389
"[Narrator] Sensibly, Grace chose to hope
for the best rather than fear the worst,"

2:25:57.473 --> 2:26:01.685
"and planned to spend the day calmly
washing her clothes and herself,"

2:26:01.727 --> 2:26:09.359
"which, for some reason or another, she was sure
none of the characters from Tom's
fictitious township would dream of doing."

2:26:12.946 --> 2:26:16.991
And then it was as if Dogville just waited.

2:26:18.076 --> 2:26:23.372
"Even the wind dropped,
leaving the town in an unfamiliar calm."

2:26:24.248 --> 2:26:28.377
"as if somebody had put a large
cheese dish cover over it,"

2:26:29.170 --> 2:26:34.091
and created the kind of quietness
that descends while you are awaiting visitors.

2:26:36.343 --> 2:26:43.642
"After two days off Grace had been put back
to work, but the quietness remained."

2:26:43.892 --> 2:26:52.859
Indeed it intensified until on the fifth day
it swelled into a strange mood

2:26:52.901 --> 2:26:57.030
"that, all of a sudden, brought all the citizens
to the street to listen."

2:26:59.574 --> 2:27:03.244
"They asked each other
if the phone was really still down,"

2:27:03.578 --> 2:27:08.499
or if they'd heard about Ben having had to turn
his truck around on his way to Georgetown

2:27:08.541 --> 2:27:13.003
that very morning on account
of a large tree blocking the road.

2:27:13.337 --> 2:27:15.297
They were not worried.

2:27:15.673 --> 2:27:21.887
"worried was not the right word,
and then Tom spotted the cars."

2:27:23.931 --> 2:27:26.016
Tom has binoculars.
But you can see 'em with the naked eyes.

2:27:26.099 --> 2:27:27.684
There must be at least eight!

2:27:27.684 --> 2:27:29.353
I thought the road was blocked.

2:27:29.394 --> 2:27:31.688
They must have come through
before the tree came down.

2:27:34.774 --> 2:27:38.445
June's bed! The sheets need changing.
I'll be there in a minute.

2:27:39.446 --> 2:27:40.697
"Hello, June."

2:27:43.032 --> 2:27:47.161
"[Narrator] Grace had just started on the bed,
which June had soiled yet again,"

2:27:47.495 --> 2:27:52.124
when an irritating feeling of wasting her time
forced itself upon her.

2:27:53.334 --> 2:27:56.670
And it was without thinking
she then said the words:

2:27:56.796 --> 2:27:59.131
Nobody gonna sleep here.

2:28:04.136 --> 2:28:06.763
"[Narrator] She didn't say them out loud,"

2:28:06.763 --> 2:28:11.977
but even so she was startled by the uttrance
that had urged itself upon her.

2:28:13.728 --> 2:28:17.023
Where had these ominous words come from?

2:28:26.324 --> 2:28:31.204
Darkness was falling as Grace made
her way home from work that evening.

2:28:31.412 --> 2:28:37.001
The people on the square overlooking the valley
had finally given up hope of seeing anything else

2:28:37.043 --> 2:28:39.086
now the light had faded.

2:28:39.128 --> 2:28:42.590
They trudged up Elm Street in disappointment.

2:28:47.261 --> 2:28:48.887
"- Tom?
- Hi, Grace."

2:28:48.887 --> 2:28:53.809
"There were some cars, but it's too dark,
we can't see any more."

2:28:53.934 --> 2:28:56.728
We haven't seen much of each other.

2:28:57.312 --> 2:29:00.357
"Yah, I know. I've been busy
with my book, you know."

2:29:00.357 --> 2:29:02.150
Can I ask you something?

2:29:03.026 --> 2:29:04.652
"Yeah, anything."

2:29:08.197 --> 2:29:11.075
"You couldn't bring yourself
to throw it away, could you?"

2:29:12.743 --> 2:29:16.205
The number he gave you that night.
You couldn't throw it away.

2:29:16.497 --> 2:29:21.502
I told yhou how dangerous that man was.
That was stupid.

2:29:27.800 --> 2:29:34.097
"[Narrator] Stupid or not, Tom was soon
a passionate spokesman for locking Grace
in her shed that night."

2:29:35.640 --> 2:29:40.395
If the vehicles were indeed a sign
that the call Tom had placed five days earlier

2:29:40.478 --> 2:29:45.191
on be half of the community to the number
indicated on the card from his bureau drawer

2:29:45.316 --> 2:29:47.277
"had at last led to action,"

2:29:47.318 --> 2:29:50.530
"and Grace was now to be eliminated from their lives,"

2:29:50.571 --> 2:29:54.784
it would surely look good
if the town had also locked her up.

2:29:56.953 --> 2:30:00.956
Grace was lying on the bed
when Jason was sent up with the key.

2:30:01.165 --> 2:30:03.709
"Grace heard it turn in the lock,"

2:30:03.751 --> 2:30:12.009
but she was deeply absorbed by arguments
and thoughts on matters she had otherwise
avoided for the best part of a
year now.

2:30:30.777 --> 2:30:35.156
From the moment when they'd finally heard
the sound of vehicles starting one after the other

2:30:35.198 --> 2:30:37.283
"from the direction of the edge of the woods,"

2:30:37.325 --> 2:30:39.827
things had moved rapidly.

2:30:40.286 --> 2:30:44.165
Tom had arranged a delegation
to provide a proper reception.

2:30:44.915 --> 2:30:50.337
"Dogville might be off the beaten track,
but it was hospitable, nevertheless."

2:31:03.350 --> 2:31:05.477
Welcome gentlemen. Welcome.

2:31:05.602 --> 2:31:08.063
The town places itself at your disposal!

2:31:08.104 --> 2:31:11.316
I should have a large key to give to you.
But I only have this small one.

2:31:11.357 --> 2:31:13.610
- Where is she?
- Secured by this very key.

2:31:13.651 --> 2:31:15.194
Where is she?

2:31:15.612 --> 2:31:18.823
Okay. If you are wondering about that sound.

2:31:18.865 --> 2:31:22.285
The driving piles for the new penitentiary.

2:31:22.326 --> 2:31:27.289
"Tell me, has the crime rate really gone up
in this country, as we are lead to believe?"

2:31:27.331 --> 2:31:33.671
"Maybe people just regard things as criminal,
because they envy their success?"

2:31:33.712 --> 2:31:37.508
What's your opinion on the subject?

2:31:38.133 --> 2:31:42.721
Maybe you have none.
I'll get the door... sorry.

2:31:45.390 --> 2:31:48.476
Voila! As the French might say.

2:31:48.685 --> 2:31:50.311
What the hell is this?

2:31:50.729 --> 2:31:52.230
Who did that?

2:31:52.313 --> 2:31:54.983
"Billy, put your hand up,
put your hand up."

2:32:03.658 --> 2:32:08.746
"We felt safer, when she had the chain on.
You are probably more adapted at handling her kind."

2:32:10.915 --> 2:32:16.295
None of us feel able to accept money
for just helping people.

2:32:16.378 --> 2:32:21.008
I mean not unless it would make you
feel better to diverst yourself.

2:32:21.008 --> 2:32:23.343
- Shut the hell up!
- Absolutely.

2:32:27.931 --> 2:32:34.687
"[Narrator] Grace was no expert in exclusive
automobiles, yet she recognized with no difficulty"

2:32:34.687 --> 2:32:39.734
the sound of vehicle that was rounding the corner
from Canyon Road at that very moment.

2:32:40.985 --> 2:32:48.909
"Alas, in Grace's memory the legendary purr
of the Cadillac series 355C was inextricably linked"

2:32:48.993 --> 2:32:52.621
"with another, rather less sophisticated sound:"

2:32:52.830 --> 2:32:56.750
that of gunfire directed against her person.

2:33:20.732 --> 2:33:21.941
Don't..!

2:33:46.340 --> 2:33:50.302
You need to justify your actions
before you shoot us.

2:33:51.678 --> 2:33:53.680
That's new.

2:33:57.726 --> 2:34:01.896
"That could be interpreted as weakness,
Daddy... I'm disappointed in you!"

2:34:02.939 --> 2:34:04.232
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

2:34:04.232 --> 2:34:06.401
You shot at me before.

2:34:06.776 --> 2:34:12.782
"Yes, I'm sorry. I regret that."

2:34:13.199 --> 2:34:14.950
You ran away.

2:34:15.326 --> 2:34:19.622
But shooting at you certainly
didn't help matters.

2:34:19.747 --> 2:34:22.916
"Of course not.
You're far, far too stubborn."

2:34:25.586 --> 2:34:28.005
"If you don't want to kill me,
then why did you come?"

2:34:28.005 --> 2:34:32.676
"Our last conversation, the one in which
you told me what it was you didn't like about me"

2:34:32.717 --> 2:34:36.221
"never really concluded, as you ran away."

2:34:36.263 --> 2:34:39.766
I should be allowed to tell you
what I don't like about you.

2:34:39.766 --> 2:34:45.605
That I believe would be
a rule of polite conversation.

2:34:45.730 --> 2:34:47.899
That's why you showed up?

2:34:50.776 --> 2:34:53.154
And you call me stubborn.

2:34:53.404 --> 2:34:57.575
You're sure you're not here to force me
to go back and become like you?

2:34:57.783 --> 2:35:04.164
"If I thought there was a chance of forcing you,
but of course that will never happen."

2:35:04.581 --> 2:35:12.673
You are more than welcome to return home
and become my daughter again anytime

2:35:12.881 --> 2:35:22.932
and I would even begin to share my power
and responsibility with you if you did.

2:35:23.141 --> 2:35:25.852
Not that you care.

2:35:25.977 --> 2:35:27.478
So what is it?

2:35:27.937 --> 2:35:31.065
"What is it, the thing...
the thing that you don't like about me?"

2:35:31.107 --> 2:35:33.568
It was a word you used that provoked me.

2:35:33.609 --> 2:35:36.153
You called me arrogant.

2:35:36.404 --> 2:35:40.324
"To plunder, as it were, a God given right.
I'd call that arrogant, daddy."

2:35:40.366 --> 2:35:43.577
But that is exactly what I don't like about you.

2:35:43.619 --> 2:35:45.329
It is you that is arrogant.

2:35:45.412 --> 2:35:47.664
That's what you came here to say?

2:35:51.084 --> 2:35:54.713
"I'm not the one passing judgement, Daddy.
You are."

2:35:55.797 --> 2:36:00.260
"You do not pass judgement,
because you sympathize with them."

2:36:00.302 --> 2:36:07.142
"A deprived childhood and a homicide
really isn't necessarily a homicide, right?"

2:36:07.684 --> 2:36:10.395
The only thing you can blame is circumstances.

2:36:10.436 --> 2:36:15.274
"Rapists and murderers may be the victims,
according to you."

2:36:15.358 --> 2:36:18.611
"But I, I call them dogs,"

2:36:18.653 --> 2:36:22.907
and if they're lapping up their own vomit
the only way to stop them is with the lash.

2:36:22.948 --> 2:36:25.201
But dogs only obey their own nature.

2:36:25.242 --> 2:36:27.786
So why shouldn't we forgive them?

2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:31.081
"Dogs can be taught many useful things,"

2:36:31.206 --> 2:36:36.461
but not if we forgive them
every time they obey their own nature.

2:36:48.014 --> 2:36:53.227
So I'm arrogant. I'm arrogant
because I forgive them?

2:36:53.269 --> 2:36:54.520
My God..

2:36:54.771 --> 2:36:58.691
Can't you see how condescending
you are when you say that?

2:36:59.150 --> 2:37:07.741
"You have this preconceived notion
that nobody, listne, that nobody can't possibly attain"

2:37:07.783 --> 2:37:11.995
"the same high ethical standards as you,
so you exonorate them."

2:37:12.079 --> 2:37:17.209
I can not think of anything
more arrogant than that.

2:37:17.251 --> 2:37:23.465
"You, my child... my dear child
you forgive others with excuses"

2:37:23.548 --> 2:37:26.301
that you would never in the world
permit for yourself.

2:37:26.301 --> 2:37:29.012
Why shouldn't I be merciful?
Why?

2:37:29.054 --> 2:37:34.392
"No no no.. You should be merciful,
when there is time to be merciful."

2:37:34.517 --> 2:37:39.981
But you must maintain your own standard.
You owe them that. You owe them that.

2:37:40.773 --> 2:37:47.029
"The penalty you deserve for your transgressions,
they deserve for their transgressions."

2:37:47.071 --> 2:37:48.531
They are human beings.

2:37:48.531 --> 2:37:52.993
No no no.. Does every human being
need to be accountable for their action?

2:37:53.035 --> 2:37:55.871
Of course they do.
But you don't even give them that chance.

2:37:55.913 --> 2:37:58.498
All that is extremely arrogant.

2:37:58.498 --> 2:38:01.877
I love you. I love you. I love you to death.

2:38:02.252 --> 2:38:06.172
But you are the most arrogant person
I've ever met.

2:38:06.214 --> 2:38:08.425
And you call me arrogant!

2:38:12.512 --> 2:38:16.557
I have no more to say.

2:38:19.394 --> 2:38:23.397
You are arrogant. I'm arrogant.
You've said it. Now you can leave.

2:38:23.397 --> 2:38:26.192
"And without my daughter, I suppose?"

2:38:32.156 --> 2:38:34.575
"- I said, without my daughter?
- Hmm, yes!"

2:38:35.993 --> 2:38:38.662
- Well..
- Yes.

2:38:38.745 --> 2:38:48.964
"Well, you decide. you decide...
Grace, they say you are having some trouble here."

2:38:49.673 --> 2:38:54.344
No. No more trouble than back home.

2:38:54.594 --> 2:38:57.055
I'll give you a little time to think about this.

2:38:57.096 --> 2:39:00.224
- Perhaps you will change your mind.
- I won't.

2:39:00.516 --> 2:39:04.937
"Listen, my love.. power is not so bad..."

2:39:05.021 --> 2:39:11.694
I am sure that you can find a way
to make use of it in your own fashion...

2:39:14.738 --> 2:39:16.740
Take a walk and think about it.

2:39:17.533 --> 2:39:28.877
The people who live here are doing their
best under very hard circumstances.

2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:31.004
"If you say so, Grace."

2:39:32.839 --> 2:39:39.971
But is their best really good enough?

2:39:41.848 --> 2:39:43.057
Do they love you?

2:39:53.317 --> 2:39:56.654
Grace had already thought for a long time.

2:39:56.695 --> 2:40:00.741
She had known that if she were not shot
when the gangsters arrived

2:40:00.741 --> 2:40:04.244
"she would be faced with her father's
suggestion that she return, to become"

2:40:04.328 --> 2:40:09.249
a conspirator with him and his gang of
thugs and felons and she did not need any walk

2:40:09.249 --> 2:40:11.918
"to reconsider her response to that,"

2:40:12.919 --> 2:40:18.925
even though the difference betwen the people
she knew back home and the people
she'd met in Dogville had proven

2:40:18.967 --> 2:40:22.136
somewhat slighter than she'd expected.

2:40:23.346 --> 2:40:28.309
Grace looked at the gooseberry bushes
so fragiles in the smooth darkness.

2:40:28.392 --> 2:40:31.771
"It was good to know
that if you did not treat them ill,"

2:40:31.896 --> 2:40:37.318
"they would be there, come sping as always,
and come summer they'd again be bursting"

2:40:37.359 --> 2:40:43.031
"with the quite incomprehensible quantity
of berries that were so good in pies,"

2:40:43.115 --> 2:40:45.200
specially with cinnamon.

2:40:46.869 --> 2:40:50.163
Grace looked around at the frightened faces
behind the windowpanes

2:40:50.247 --> 2:40:56.211
"that were following her every step, and felt
ashamed of being part of inflicting that fear."

2:40:57.962 --> 2:41:02.717
How could she ever hate them for
what was at bottom merely their weakness?

2:41:03.092 --> 2:41:06.763
She would probably have done things
like those that had befallen her

2:41:06.888 --> 2:41:09.390
"if she'd lived in one of these houses,"

2:41:09.474 --> 2:41:13.352
to measure them by her own yardstick
as her father put it.

2:41:13.686 --> 2:41:23.570
"Would she not, in all honesty, have done
the same as Chuck and Vera and Ben and
Mrs. Henson and Tom"

2:41:23.946 --> 2:41:26.907
and all these people in their houses?

2:41:30.369 --> 2:41:32.829
Grace paused.

2:41:33.205 --> 2:41:38.084
"And while she did, the clouds scattered
and let the moonlight through"

2:41:45.633 --> 2:41:49.887
and Dogville underwent another
of little changes of light.

2:42:03.150 --> 2:42:06.779
"It was as if the light,
previously so merciful and faint,"

2:42:06.779 --> 2:42:11.116
finally refused to cover up for the town any longer.

2:42:12.200 --> 2:42:17.205
"Suddenly you could no longer imagine a berry
that would appear one day on a gooseberry bush,"

2:42:17.205 --> 2:42:20.584
but only see the thorn that was there right now.

2:42:21.459 --> 2:42:28.758
The light now penetrated every unevenness
and flaw in the buildings... and in...the people!

2:42:32.011 --> 2:42:36.974
And all of a sudden she knew the answer
to her question all too well:

2:42:38.059 --> 2:42:44.231
"If she had acted like them, she could not have
defenced a single one of her actions"

2:42:44.273 --> 2:42:47.276
and could not have condemned them
harshly enough.

2:42:48.110 --> 2:42:54.032
It was as if her sorrow and pain finally
assumed their rightful place.

2:42:54.283 --> 2:42:59.287
"No, what they had done was
not good enough."

2:42:59.704 --> 2:43:04.209
"And if one had the power to put it to rights,
it was one's duty to do so,"

2:43:04.250 --> 2:43:08.713
"for the sake of the other towns,
for the sake of humanity,"

2:43:09.672 --> 2:43:15.720
"and not least, for the sake of the human being
that was Grace herself."

2:43:24.186 --> 2:43:30.484
"If I went back and became your daughter again,"

2:43:30.984 --> 2:43:33.737
when would I be given the power
you're talking about?

2:43:38.241 --> 2:43:40.786
- Now?
- At once!

2:43:41.077 --> 2:43:42.120
Why not?

2:43:48.251 --> 2:43:54.173
So that would mean that I'd also take on
the immediate responsibilities at once.

2:43:55.008 --> 2:43:57.593
I'd be a part in the problem solving...

2:43:59.095 --> 2:44:02.598
like the problem.. of Dogville.

2:44:08.479 --> 2:44:13.442
We can start by shooting a dog
and nailing it to a wall.

2:44:13.567 --> 2:44:20.490
"Over there beneath that lamp, for example.
Well, it might help. It sometimes does."

2:44:20.782 --> 2:44:26.871
"It would only make the town more frightened,
but hardly make it a better place."

2:44:29.082 --> 2:44:30.750
And it could happen again.

2:44:31.626 --> 2:44:43.638
"Somebody happening by,
revealing their frailty."

2:44:47.933 --> 2:44:51.228
"That's what I wanna use the power for,
if you don't mind."

2:44:54.940 --> 2:44:59.069
I wanna make this world a little better.

2:45:03.532 --> 2:45:07.160
"That damn kid won't shup up.
Says he wants to talk to you, Miss."

2:45:07.494 --> 2:45:09.371
Can we just shoot him now?

2:45:11.039 --> 2:45:12.874
Let me talk to him.

2:45:17.462 --> 2:45:19.505
What? What is it?

2:45:21.966 --> 2:45:26.262
"A man can't really be blamed
for being scared now, can he?"

2:45:26.595 --> 2:45:28.556
- No. That's true.
- No!

2:45:29.140 --> 2:45:31.016
"I'm scared, Grace."

2:45:31.267 --> 2:45:34.144
I used you. And I'm sorry.

2:45:34.228 --> 2:45:38.732
"I am stupid, I am.
Maybe even arrogant sometimes."

2:45:40.984 --> 2:45:42.444
"You are, Tom."

2:45:44.988 --> 2:45:49.367
"Although using people is not very charming,
I think you have to agree"

2:45:49.451 --> 2:45:54.289
that this specific illustration
has surpassed all expectations.

2:45:54.330 --> 2:45:56.416
It says so much about being human.

2:45:56.749 --> 2:46:01.337
"It's been painful, but I think you also have to
agree it has been edifying. Wouldn't you say?"

2:46:01.462 --> 2:46:05.341
"Not now, Tom.
Not now."

2:46:09.637 --> 2:46:13.766
"If there is any town in this world
would be better without, this is it."

2:46:20.189 --> 2:46:22.274
Shoot them and burn down the town.

2:46:26.862 --> 2:46:29.865
"What?
Something else, honey?"

2:46:30.824 --> 2:46:33.201
There is a family with kids...

2:46:36.037 --> 2:46:39.123
do the kids first and make the mother watch.

2:46:39.541 --> 2:46:43.503
Tell her you will stop if she can
hold back her tears.

2:46:47.507 --> 2:46:49.592
I owe her that.

2:46:56.098 --> 2:46:59.268
I'm afraid she cries a little too easily.

2:47:01.603 --> 2:47:04.314
We'd better get you out of here.

2:47:05.691 --> 2:47:08.777
"I'm afraid, you've learned
far too much already."

2:47:15.158 --> 2:47:18.870
"Are you cold, Sweetie.
Do you need a wrap?"

2:47:19.662 --> 2:47:20.872
I'm fine.

2:47:24.125 --> 2:47:27.462
You want the curtains opened?
You don't need them anymore.

2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:29.505
What do you think?

2:47:35.553 --> 2:47:41.517
I think we should open them.
I think it's appropriate.

2:49:38.796 --> 2:49:40.298
"Bingo, Grace!"

2:49:42.967 --> 2:49:43.884
Bingo!

2:49:46.303 --> 2:49:50.099
"I have to tell you, your illustration
beat the hell out of mine."

2:49:52.476 --> 2:49:57.230
"It's frightening, yes, but so clear."

2:49:58.607 --> 2:50:04.279
Do you think that I can allow myself
to use it as an inspiration in my writing?

2:50:13.579 --> 2:50:15.039
Goodbye Tom.

2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:46.820
- Somethings you have to do yourself.
- Really

2:50:50.365 --> 2:50:53.368
That one you're gonna have to explain
to me on the way home.

2:50:54.953 --> 2:50:56.829
[Narrator] Suddenly there was a noise.

2:50:56.954 --> 2:51:01.834
"Not so persuasive and powerful
as it had been on a rainy night in spring,"

2:51:01.959 --> 2:51:07.965
but loud enough to work its way through
the final sighs of the timber that was rapidly burning out.

2:51:09.091 --> 2:51:12.344
It came again.
Everyone heard it.

2:51:12.469 --> 2:51:14.555
Grace was the first to recognize it.

2:51:14.596 --> 2:51:15.973
"That's Moses,"

2:51:16.306 --> 2:51:19.393
"That's Moses, she said,
and jumped out of the car."

2:51:20.185 --> 2:51:27.234
"She quickly covered the distance to the dog pen
over what, now the buildings were gone,
could scarcely be
called a street,"

2:51:27.275 --> 2:51:32.405
"and certainly not Elm Street as there wasn't
a tree left on Dogville's little mountain ledge,"

2:51:32.489 --> 2:51:34.157
let alone an elm.

2:51:34.491 --> 2:51:36.367
It was Moses.

2:51:36.409 --> 2:51:39.829
His survival was astonishing.
A miracle.

2:51:41.080 --> 2:51:44.333
"No, just let him be."

2:51:45.001 --> 2:51:48.129
They will have spotted the flames
in Georgetown by now.

2:51:49.004 --> 2:51:51.257
Some one'll come and find him.

2:51:56.261 --> 2:51:59.765
He's just angry
because I once took his bone.

2:52:10.400 --> 2:52:16.823
"Whether Grace left Dogville or on the contrary,
Dogville had left her (and the world in general)"

2:52:16.865 --> 2:52:22.161
is a question of a more artful nature
that few would benefit from by asking

2:52:22.286 --> 2:52:25.122
and even fewer by providing an answer.

2:52:25.206 --> 2:52:28.501
And nor indeed will it be answered here!
