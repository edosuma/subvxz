WEBVTT

00:06.877 --> 00:08.577
I need full access to the comms,

00:08.612 --> 00:10.868
so I can send this out
to the people who can use it.

00:10.868 --> 00:13.636
<i>Anna is an outsider with direct access</i>

00:13.670 --> 00:15.638
to Sorrento-Gillis, and can show him

00:15.672 --> 00:17.640
who his deputy really is.

00:17.674 --> 00:20.510
Avasarala sent you the comms buffer.

00:20.544 --> 00:22.011
Yeah, she made it!

00:22.045 --> 00:24.413
This is Admiral Souther
of the UNN "Agatha King."

00:24.448 --> 00:26.716
<i>I have relieved
Fleet Admiral Nguyen of duties</i>

00:26.750 --> 00:28.184
<i>under charges of conspiracy.</i>

00:28.218 --> 00:30.353
I'll be transmitting proof
to both fleets.

00:31.288 --> 00:33.523
There's been a mutiny
aboard the "Agatha King,"

00:33.557 --> 00:35.892
and UNN ships are firing on each other.

00:35.926 --> 00:38.261
- Hammurabi out.
- Katoa, what are you building?

00:38.295 --> 00:41.364
- Soon, soon, soon!
- Sir, come with me, please.

00:41.398 --> 00:43.332
- Soon!
- You will transfer

00:43.367 --> 00:46.002
launch control of the hybrid
pods to my ship immediately.

00:46.036 --> 00:47.603
- Understood.
- Thank you.

00:47.638 --> 00:49.338
- For taking care of me.
- You can thank me

00:49.373 --> 00:51.007
if we get your little girl back.

00:51.041 --> 00:53.009
- Then we need another conduit.
- The one with the most

00:53.043 --> 00:56.712
similar genetic profile
would be Mei Meng.

00:58.215 --> 01:00.583
Any idea of the resistance inside?

01:00.617 --> 01:04.387
In terms of humans? No.

01:04.421 --> 01:06.556
They've launched the hybrids.

<i>They have target lock,

02:12.789 --> 02:14.257
<i>This is Admiral Nguyen. We have put down</i>

02:16.226 --> 02:19.362

return to the AO immediately</i>

02:19.396 --> 02:20.963

02:20.998 --> 02:23.199
The communications
said mutiny, goddamnit.

02:23.233 --> 02:26.002
I want to know what the hell is
going on out there, and now.

02:26.036 --> 02:27.770
I'm sorry, sir. The transmission delay

02:27.804 --> 02:29.505
to the A.O is 39-plus minutes.

02:29.539 --> 02:31.140
I'll let you know
the moment we have contact.

02:31.174 --> 02:32.775
We need to talk to Admiral Nguyen.

02:32.809 --> 02:34.277
Sir, we tight-beamed the "Agatha King,"

02:34.311 --> 02:35.878
but we're still awaiting their response.

02:35.913 --> 02:37.813
<i>Sat-com confirms, UNN "Jimenez"</i>

02:37.848 --> 02:40.283
<i>has been destroyed.
Fired upon, it appears,</i>

02:40.317 --> 02:41.384
<i>by the "Agatha King."</i>

02:41.418 --> 02:43.313
Jesus Christ.

02:43.921 --> 02:46.155
Our own ships, firing on one another.

02:46.189 --> 02:48.090
What the fuck is going on out there?

02:59.770 --> 03:02.004
The launcher is reloading.

03:04.841 --> 03:06.175
Another full salvo.

03:06.209 --> 03:07.843
Alex, blow them out of the fucking sky!

03:07.878 --> 03:09.545
I don't have a clear shot
on the launcher.

03:09.579 --> 03:13.049
<i>I can only shoot the pods down
once they're in the air.</i>

03:16.553 --> 03:18.554
PDC's on auto track.

03:43.647 --> 03:45.982
It's too many.

03:52.122 --> 03:53.556
Goddamnit!

03:53.590 --> 03:55.344
We're dry.

03:56.293 --> 03:58.427
<i>At least two dozen
of those things made it by us,</i>

03:58.462 --> 04:02.031
<i>but we weren't the only ones shooting.</i>

04:02.065 --> 04:04.533
UNN and MCRN ships
destroyed some as well.

04:04.568 --> 04:06.435
Naomi, where are they headed?

04:06.470 --> 04:08.437
Their engines and transponders shut down

04:08.472 --> 04:10.606
as soon as they cleared the gravity well.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.543
They're stealth tech.
The Roci can't track them.

04:14.578 --> 04:16.579
Mars.

04:16.613 --> 04:18.380
They're going to Mars.

04:18.415 --> 04:20.048
How the hell are you so sure about that?

04:20.083 --> 04:22.084
This station belongs to Jules-Pierre Mao.

04:22.119 --> 04:25.554
Errinwright owns him,
and this is his war.

04:25.589 --> 04:27.323
They have to be going to Mars.

04:27.357 --> 04:29.892
If any of those things
get down to the cities,

04:29.926 --> 04:31.761
they're going to be
nearly impossible to stop.

04:31.795 --> 04:33.295
They'll kill thousands.

04:33.330 --> 04:36.802
And contaminate everything
with Protomolecule.

04:37.701 --> 04:39.735
Mars could become another Eros.

04:39.770 --> 04:41.904
Everyone, get inside.

04:44.307 --> 04:46.675
Let's do what we came here to do.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.344
Those pods were launched from here.

04:48.378 --> 04:51.347
There's got to be a way to
abort them; we'll find it.

04:53.183 --> 04:55.418
That's a Martian Corvette.

04:55.452 --> 04:57.186
And the space suits, body armor, weapons.

04:57.220 --> 05:00.122
They're all MCRN.
It's a Martian assault team.

05:00.157 --> 05:02.958
And the "Agatha King"
just remotely launched

05:02.993 --> 05:05.428
the hybrid pods.

05:05.462 --> 05:06.957
It's over.

05:08.165 --> 05:10.633
Order everyone not to fight.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.168
No reason to get anyone else killed.

05:12.202 --> 05:14.303
But we can't just hand
everything over to them.

05:14.337 --> 05:16.305
That's exactly what we have to do.

05:16.339 --> 05:19.108
Maybe we can avoid
spending the rest of our lives

05:19.142 --> 05:20.709
- in a Martian prison.
- I think it's premature

05:20.744 --> 05:23.446
to hand over all your work
when we still have options.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.680
What options?

05:29.052 --> 05:31.320
The assault team is on
the far side of the station.

05:31.354 --> 05:33.289
Most of the systems are powered down.

05:33.323 --> 05:34.790
It's going to take time
for them to reach us.

05:34.825 --> 05:36.058
Time to do what?

05:36.093 --> 05:37.860
To get to our ships and launch.

05:37.894 --> 05:39.361
Why wouldn't they just shoot us down?

05:39.396 --> 05:41.867
We'll tell them
we have children on board.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.936
We can do this, but we have to go now.

05:48.572 --> 05:50.005
All right.

05:51.608 --> 05:53.175
Get on the radio.

05:53.210 --> 05:55.044
Tell everyone on that side of the station

05:55.078 --> 05:57.424
that the Martians intend to kill us all.

05:58.415 --> 06:00.983
- Fight for their lives.
- They'll get slaughtered, sir.

06:01.017 --> 06:02.551
Would you rather go with them?

06:02.586 --> 06:04.473
I can buy us even more time.

06:05.522 --> 06:08.057
Gather up the children,
and meet us at the shuttle bay.

06:08.091 --> 06:10.059
<i>Right away, Dr. Strickland.</i>

06:31.882 --> 06:34.150
Such a waste.

06:38.221 --> 06:40.923
But this is what you were made to do.

06:52.903 --> 06:56.539
<i>I'm getting heat signatures.
Not sure how many.</i>

06:56.573 --> 06:59.108
- It's weak.
- Can you tell if any of them

06:59.142 --> 07:01.076
- are children?
- No, but it's coming

07:01.111 --> 07:03.312
- from six levels down.
<i>- Are they armed?</i>

07:03.346 --> 07:06.248
There's no way to tell,
but it's a good guess.

07:36.213 --> 07:38.400
You ever get cramped in that thing?

07:39.182 --> 07:42.451
- You kind of grow into it.
- Like a plant.

07:42.485 --> 07:44.920
I grew a watermelon in a box once,

07:44.955 --> 07:46.255
for a science project.

07:46.289 --> 07:48.324
It came out square.

07:48.358 --> 07:52.294
<i>- About this wide, this high.
- Are they hypoxic?</i>

07:52.329 --> 07:53.829
<i>Guess it was more of a rectangle.</i>

07:53.863 --> 07:54.930
They're whistling in the dark.

07:54.965 --> 07:57.066
Still tasted the same.

08:04.341 --> 08:06.508
Take cover first, then shoot!

08:09.045 --> 08:10.312
Shit.

08:12.048 --> 08:14.216
- You got a count?
- Four.

08:18.088 --> 08:19.755
Clear.

08:29.232 --> 08:31.800
They don't look like soldiers.

08:31.835 --> 08:33.736
They shot at us.

08:33.770 --> 08:35.504
They made the choice.

08:47.517 --> 08:49.918
Fuck. Make this thing

08:49.953 --> 08:52.655
show me what's happening
in orbit, please.

09:07.470 --> 09:10.939
The "Agatha King." It's Souther's ship.

09:10.974 --> 09:13.745
I can put a scope on that. Hold on.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.351
What?

09:22.385 --> 09:25.354
That ship was hit with a hybrid pod.

09:25.388 --> 09:27.256
You don't want to be on it.

09:27.290 --> 09:30.759
The protomolecule is
spreading incredibly fast.

09:30.794 --> 09:32.828
Oh, my God.

10:30.873 --> 10:32.407
Jesus, what the fuck?

10:32.441 --> 10:34.843
He was crazy, you saw that.
He was trying to kill me.

10:34.877 --> 10:37.312
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down, okay?

10:37.346 --> 10:40.148
What's your name?

10:40.182 --> 10:42.650
- Larson.
- Okay, Larson.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.987
Take a minute, and tell me
what the hell happened here.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.590
We were fired on.
We got hulled below decks,

10:48.624 --> 10:50.658
and my damage control team,
we go down there to help out,

10:50.693 --> 10:52.026
and we see this,
this blue shit everywhere,

10:52.061 --> 10:53.495
and a bunch of guys killing each other.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.363
- Like the Lieutenant there?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:55.398 --> 10:57.432
We tried to get out, you know,
seal up the decks behind us.

10:57.466 --> 10:59.567
But there we're just so many
of them, and then...

10:59.602 --> 11:01.336
And then?

11:01.370 --> 11:03.538
They didn't make it.

11:03.572 --> 11:07.208
And then this crazy asshole
chases me all the way in here.

11:07.243 --> 11:10.078
Would have killed me too,
if it wasn't for you, so.

11:12.948 --> 11:15.183
Hey, how come they got
you in a restraint?

11:17.386 --> 11:19.687
What, what, what?

11:19.722 --> 11:21.423
Oh, god damnit, I got some of it on me.

11:21.457 --> 11:23.091
No, don't touch it!

11:24.493 --> 11:28.696
- Well, what is this shit?
- Let me loose, I'll help you.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.765
Tell me first.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.763
It's called protomolecule.

11:37.907 --> 11:41.209
- It's bad.
- Just tell me.

11:41.243 --> 11:45.313
Remember Eros? This is that shit.

11:45.347 --> 11:49.384
It kills everything it touches,
and it cannot be stopped.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.279
So, I'm...

11:55.257 --> 11:56.958
Yeah.

11:59.962 --> 12:03.565
Whoa, whoa, wait.

12:22.318 --> 12:25.920
But you're not dead yet,
and I need your help.

12:25.955 --> 12:27.989
We have to try to stop the infection

12:28.023 --> 12:31.759
- on this ship from spreading.
- It's too late.

12:31.794 --> 12:35.597
- You said so yourself.
- You're a sailor in the UNN.

12:35.631 --> 12:39.100
That has to mean something,
or you wouldn't be here.

12:47.042 --> 12:49.944
I don't even know
what we're fighting for.

13:54.910 --> 13:58.713
Got some small heat sources.
I'm betting it's the kids.

13:58.747 --> 14:00.114
Wait.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.184
There's something else.

14:07.456 --> 14:09.524
- It's a hybrid.
- Fall back to the "Roci."

14:09.558 --> 14:11.192
No, the kids are down that way.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.393
- Go get them.
- You can't.

14:12.428 --> 14:14.429
I'll lead it away. Go.

14:27.109 --> 14:29.210
<i>Bobbie, don't be an idiot.</i>

14:29.244 --> 14:31.212
This won't bring back your dead marines.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.747
Ma'am, for the first time in your life,

14:32.781 --> 14:34.649
please just shut the fuck up!

15:12.680 --> 15:14.314
Still no word from the "Agatha King"?

15:14.349 --> 15:16.650
No, sir, I'm sorry. We can confirm

15:16.684 --> 15:19.153
the ship is still in orbit around Io,

15:19.187 --> 15:20.487
but we haven't been able to

15:20.522 --> 15:22.923
re-establish contact with the C.I.C.

15:22.957 --> 15:24.658
What are these?

15:24.692 --> 15:26.760
Shortly after
the "Jimenez" was destroyed,

15:26.795 --> 15:29.830
there was a mass missile launch
from the surface of Io.

15:29.864 --> 15:33.000
And every ship in the A.O.
except the "Agatha King"

15:33.034 --> 15:34.500
was firing at them.

15:35.501 --> 15:38.005
- What was the target?
- We don't know, sir.

15:38.039 --> 15:40.841
We lost track of the missiles
as they left Io.

15:40.875 --> 15:44.244
We think they may have
some kind of stealth tech.

15:57.926 --> 16:00.861
<i>Launch defensive fire, defensive fire...</i>

16:05.900 --> 16:08.902
- Thought you'd left.
- I have one more thing to do.

16:14.576 --> 16:16.276
Well, if you're here to apologize,

16:16.311 --> 16:18.145
I honestly don't give a shit anymore.

16:18.179 --> 16:19.713
I am not.

16:19.747 --> 16:21.482
I want to refresh your memory.

16:21.516 --> 16:24.218
The words you said all those years ago.

16:24.252 --> 16:28.789
Just another protest, you said.
Do you remember?

16:28.823 --> 16:31.725
No greater symbol for
our cause than walking

16:31.759 --> 16:35.162
into a military base, arm in arm.

16:35.196 --> 16:38.632
It's no big deal.
We'd faced the cops before.

16:38.666 --> 16:42.903
But you knew they had orders
to fire on the crowd.

16:42.937 --> 16:45.947
You think I didn't want to warn everyone?

16:47.073 --> 16:49.176
- You know why I didn't?
- Takes a few martyrs

16:49.210 --> 16:51.945
to really solidify
a movement, doesn't it?

16:51.980 --> 16:53.580
Your words...

16:53.615 --> 16:56.650
Your words turned them into martyrs.

16:56.684 --> 17:00.754
Yes. That's my shame.

17:00.788 --> 17:04.590
But all those people who died
for what we believed.

17:04.626 --> 17:06.859
I never imagined
they would only be the first

17:06.895 --> 17:09.796
- in a long line for you.
- Oh, please, Anna.

17:09.830 --> 17:13.000
- For God's sake, let the past...
- Die?

17:13.034 --> 17:15.169
No, you're right. I want to be done

17:15.203 --> 17:16.803
with the past, too.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.474
I walked away once.

17:21.509 --> 17:23.442
This time...

17:24.811 --> 17:26.980
I'm not walking away.

17:27.405 --> 17:32.076
This time, you're going
to do the right thing.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.656
<i>Time is short, and I'll be brief.</i>

17:35.690 --> 17:38.025
<i>Martian Defense Minister
Kurshunov suffered</i>

17:38.059 --> 17:40.360
<i>a fatal heart attack
earlier this evening.</i>

17:42.330 --> 17:44.031
Clear!

18:04.118 --> 18:05.686
Prax.

18:13.595 --> 18:17.397
- She was right here.
- She can't be far.

18:17.432 --> 18:19.967
Let's keep looking.

19:11.019 --> 19:13.253
There's a corridor number.

19:15.690 --> 19:18.091
Got it.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.837
- Amos?
<i>- Are you coming or what?</i>

19:30.872 --> 19:33.006
They were bringing the kids
to a pair of shuttles.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.742
I opened the outer doors
to depressurize the bay.

19:35.777 --> 19:38.478
It won't hold them long
if they find vac suits.

19:38.513 --> 19:41.350
<i>Holden, you got access
to station controls?</i>

19:41.375 --> 19:43.976
What about the hybrid pods?
Any way to abort them?

19:44.011 --> 19:46.078
<i>Checking. Launch controls were</i>

19:46.113 --> 19:47.480
transferred to the "Agatha King."

19:47.514 --> 19:49.882
There's no way to stop them from here.

19:49.917 --> 19:52.351
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Jesus Christ.</i>

19:52.386 --> 19:54.153
Are you sure those things
are heading to Mars?

19:54.187 --> 19:55.655
- I'm sure.
- Holden.

19:55.689 --> 19:57.123
<i>There's got to be something.</i>

20:02.095 --> 20:04.830
There's someone here who should know.

20:04.865 --> 20:07.033
Let me go ask.

20:12.773 --> 20:14.574
What are you doing?

20:14.608 --> 20:16.342
Bringing the "Razorback" down from orbit.

20:16.376 --> 20:18.177
- Why?
- Because I am going to

20:18.211 --> 20:20.413
fly it up to the "Agatha King."
I'm going to find a way

20:20.447 --> 20:21.954
to stop those pods.

20:23.250 --> 20:26.352
You can't do it alone.
Keep an eye on our people.

20:26.386 --> 20:27.687
I will.

21:30.945 --> 21:33.446
Sir.

21:35.116 --> 21:36.737
You said it was urgent.

21:37.385 --> 21:40.420
<i>Simultaneously, the MCRN "Karakum,"</i>

21:40.454 --> 21:42.422
<i>dispatched by Kurshunov to take delivery</i>

21:42.456 --> 21:43.757
<i>of your protomolecule technology...</i>

21:43.791 --> 21:46.413
- How did you get that?
- Does it matter?

21:47.128 --> 21:49.596
Let's call it an act of God.

21:49.630 --> 21:52.098
You're not even going to deny it?

21:52.133 --> 21:56.548
- I meant every word I said.
- You just admitted to treason.

22:08.482 --> 22:11.251
- Was he always like that?
- Like what?

22:11.285 --> 22:13.686
Spineless and weak.

22:13.721 --> 22:15.989
Dignified face with nothing behind it.

22:16.023 --> 22:17.490
You're finished.

22:17.525 --> 22:19.492
He doesn't care about treason.

22:19.527 --> 22:22.595
That's just him parroting you
because you talked to him last.

22:22.630 --> 22:25.698
If he spoke to a janitor,
he'd be passionately declaiming

22:25.733 --> 22:29.702
about a fucking mop. It's agonizing.

22:29.737 --> 22:31.938
I've lost count
of how many times I stopped him

22:31.972 --> 22:33.840
from blundering into political suicide.

22:33.874 --> 22:36.643
And now, we have a chance to
assure the future of the Earth,

22:36.677 --> 22:38.812
and he's shitting himself
because he's afraid

22:38.846 --> 22:41.848
the history books
won't be flattering enough.

22:41.882 --> 22:44.150
He's changing for the better.

22:44.185 --> 22:45.718
If you've got anything to say to me,

22:45.753 --> 22:48.154
this is the last chance
you're going to get.

22:54.595 --> 22:56.942
I fought to save Earth.

22:57.331 --> 22:59.799
And you fought to save yourself.

23:02.169 --> 23:04.304
The planet deserves better than you.

23:12.413 --> 23:15.815
Secretary Errinwright
is under arrest for treason.

23:15.850 --> 23:18.184
Get him out of my sight.

23:42.610 --> 23:46.200
My legacy was going to be
a catastrophic war

23:46.881 --> 23:48.994
with millions dead.

23:50.217 --> 23:52.748
That's all on Errinwright now.

23:53.721 --> 23:55.855
Thank you.

24:11.071 --> 24:13.268
Someone's locked us out of the controls.

24:22.316 --> 24:23.716
Come with me.

24:23.751 --> 24:25.818
Kids, come on. Hold hands.

24:25.853 --> 24:28.388
- Don't make a sound...
- Leave the children.

24:28.422 --> 24:30.557
You'll be safer in here.

24:33.861 --> 24:36.162
Right, of course.

24:36.196 --> 24:38.565
Trade the children for our freedom.

24:38.599 --> 24:40.266
Or we open the doors to outside.

24:40.301 --> 24:42.135
Exactly, secure the airlock.

24:49.777 --> 24:52.512
It's okay, it's okay. I got her.

24:52.546 --> 24:55.448
The children are safe. Don't shoot.

25:00.354 --> 25:03.423
Prax? Oh, God.

25:03.457 --> 25:05.858
Oh, oh, thank God, it's you.

25:05.893 --> 25:07.460
Where's Mei?

25:07.494 --> 25:09.662
She's here, she's right here.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.587
Mei.

25:22.910 --> 25:24.811
- Mei.
- Daddy!

25:35.923 --> 25:37.657
Come on, guys. It's okay, you're safe.

25:37.691 --> 25:41.027
Come on, come on out. You're safe now.

25:57.378 --> 25:59.479
It's growing on the ship.

25:59.513 --> 26:01.714
I thought it only infected living things.

26:01.749 --> 26:03.516
Yeah, well, I guess it
learned some new tricks

26:03.550 --> 26:05.852
- pulling ships apart.
- If it can control the ship...

26:05.886 --> 26:08.154
We've got to get as close
to C.I.C. as we can.

26:11.025 --> 26:14.727
Damn, C.I.C. looks like
it's been hit hard.

26:14.762 --> 26:17.196
I'd prefer not to climb in
through a hole in the wall.

26:19.566 --> 26:22.435
There's a utility airlock
on the ship's bow.

26:22.469 --> 26:24.704
That'll do.

26:27.074 --> 26:29.075
Stop right there.

26:34.448 --> 26:38.651
Don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

26:44.625 --> 26:46.759
James Holden.

26:46.794 --> 26:48.628
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised it's you.

26:48.662 --> 26:52.532
Turn around, kneel.
Hands behind your head.

26:52.566 --> 26:54.638
How did you know to find me here?

26:55.803 --> 26:57.391
We didn't.

26:58.672 --> 27:00.907
Came for the children.

27:00.941 --> 27:04.210
- You're just a bonus.
- You should know.

27:04.244 --> 27:05.545
Everything done here has been

27:05.579 --> 27:08.314
to stop what's happening on Venus.

27:08.348 --> 27:10.917
Did you figure out a way to do that?

27:10.951 --> 27:12.585
Not yet.

27:12.619 --> 27:14.754
Can you stop the pods that were launched?

27:14.788 --> 27:16.422
No, the "Agatha King"...

27:16.457 --> 27:17.911
Then shut the fuck up.

27:18.959 --> 27:21.728
Get up. Pick up the data cores.

27:29.336 --> 27:31.270
Go.

27:31.305 --> 27:33.439
Move!

27:38.879 --> 27:41.948
Are you okay? Did they hurt you?

27:41.982 --> 27:43.583
I would never have let that happen.

27:43.617 --> 27:46.586
- They hurt Katoa.
- Basia's son.

27:46.620 --> 27:49.789
- Where is he?
- They did something to him.

27:49.823 --> 27:51.624
And he got blue and sick.

27:51.658 --> 27:54.093
- She just doesn't understand...
- Shut up!

27:56.964 --> 27:59.766
Are you okay? Did they hurt
you like they hurt Katoa?

27:59.800 --> 28:02.935
- Of course not.
- No, seriously.

28:02.970 --> 28:04.170
Shut up.

28:06.974 --> 28:09.175
Why didn't you come get me?

28:10.978 --> 28:12.966
I'm sorry, Mei.

28:13.881 --> 28:16.345
I'm so sorry.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.485
I love you, Daddy.

28:21.088 --> 28:23.122
I love you so much.

28:29.163 --> 28:30.830
Come.

28:34.401 --> 28:35.968
This is Amos.

28:36.003 --> 28:38.638
He's my best friend in the whole world.

28:38.672 --> 28:40.619
He helped me find you.

28:41.708 --> 28:44.710
Can you stay with Amos
for a minute, okay?

28:44.745 --> 28:47.250
I'll be right back, I promise.

28:48.015 --> 28:49.715
Okay.

28:55.389 --> 28:57.260
Hi.

28:58.592 --> 29:00.222
Hey.

29:01.195 --> 29:04.230
I just need to talk to
Dr. Strickland for a minute.

29:09.236 --> 29:11.024
I looked out for her.

29:12.039 --> 29:16.309
I protected her, even when I
could have been shot for it.

29:18.478 --> 29:21.214
I saved Mei's life.

29:21.248 --> 29:23.749
She would have died without me,
right there on Ganymede.

29:23.784 --> 29:27.053
But I went back for her,
and I got her out.

29:34.094 --> 29:35.966
Prax.

29:36.930 --> 29:39.632
I've known Mei since she was a baby.

29:39.666 --> 29:42.535
She loves me.

29:42.569 --> 29:43.870
And I love her.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.541
Please, I'm begging you.

29:49.576 --> 29:51.477
Please.

29:51.511 --> 29:54.113
Please?

30:04.591 --> 30:07.831
You're not that guy.

30:08.829 --> 30:11.297
You're not that guy.

30:23.677 --> 30:28.748
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you.

30:37.824 --> 30:39.892
I am that guy.

30:41.228 --> 30:42.762
No...

30:53.206 --> 30:56.275
- Where's Dr. Strickland?
- He's not coming with us.

30:56.310 --> 30:57.810
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

30:57.844 --> 30:59.278
Let's go, let's go.

31:27.462 --> 31:28.912
Jesus.

31:30.198 --> 31:31.957
What a mess.

31:36.805 --> 31:38.205
All right, you're going to want to find

31:38.240 --> 31:40.541
the weapon station.
It's going to be labeled

31:40.575 --> 31:42.209
Fire Control.

31:43.145 --> 31:44.545
Hey, look out!

31:49.384 --> 31:51.559
You're wasting your time.

31:52.387 --> 31:54.396
They can't be stopped.

32:50.011 --> 32:53.280
Come on, what are you waiting for?

33:34.890 --> 33:37.124
"Rocinante," this is Draper.

33:37.159 --> 33:40.127
Requesting emergency evacuation.

33:40.162 --> 33:43.130
Even if we can't abort, maybe
we can change their course.

33:43.165 --> 33:45.699
Doesn't matter how
sophisticated the pods are.

33:45.734 --> 33:48.736
- Orbital mechanics don't change.
- Right.

33:48.770 --> 33:50.929
Martians.

33:51.873 --> 33:54.742
You don't even know what you are.

33:54.776 --> 33:57.311
We train you not to know.

33:57.345 --> 34:00.981
Little Martian children
all lining up to be

34:01.016 --> 34:04.885
the best little cogs in the machine.

34:04.920 --> 34:08.489
You stopped being human
the day you claimed

34:08.523 --> 34:11.157
that miserable red planet.

34:12.226 --> 34:14.728
You're insects.

34:14.763 --> 34:18.831
Prideful insects, the whole hive of you.

34:18.867 --> 34:22.835
Scrambling to make their colony bigger.

34:22.871 --> 34:25.572
Whatever it costs.

34:25.607 --> 34:27.716
Whoever it costs.

34:32.781 --> 34:35.583
- You did it.
- That was just one.

34:35.617 --> 34:38.851
Changing all of them one at a
time is going to take a while.

34:38.887 --> 34:42.022
Well, it only takes one.

34:42.056 --> 34:44.891
And you'll never stop them all.

34:44.926 --> 34:49.897
You should thank me
for putting them down, Belter.

34:50.966 --> 34:54.902
They'd do the same thing
to you in a heartbeat.

34:54.936 --> 34:57.871
And pat themselves on the back.

34:57.906 --> 35:01.075
They're all so fucking smug.

35:01.109 --> 35:02.810
Well, bless his heart, I may just

35:02.844 --> 35:05.246
have to shoot this asshole.

35:08.283 --> 35:11.819
<i>To all ships in the vicinity of Io:</i>

35:11.853 --> 35:15.222
<i>Steer clear of the "Agatha King."</i>

35:15.257 --> 35:18.859
<i>The ship is infected
with a dangerous contagion.</i>

35:20.095 --> 35:22.062
The only way to stop it for sure

35:22.097 --> 35:25.232
is a nuclear explosion.

35:25.267 --> 35:30.237
So I'm overloading the reactor core now.

35:34.209 --> 35:37.945
Detonation should occur in...

35:40.949 --> 35:43.817
How the fuck should I know?

35:43.852 --> 35:47.154
I'm not an engineer.

35:47.188 --> 35:49.423
<i>Let's call it soon.</i>

35:49.457 --> 35:51.458
Naomi, I know that man.

35:51.493 --> 35:53.260
Get him on your comms.

35:53.295 --> 35:55.462
I can talk him out of this stupidity.

35:55.497 --> 35:59.867
There's no talk-back channel.
He must have shut it off.

35:59.901 --> 36:03.170
He doesn't want to be found. I'm sorry.

36:05.874 --> 36:08.976
<i>Well, Charanpal.</i>

36:09.010 --> 36:11.486
<i>I guess that makes us even.</i>

36:12.580 --> 36:14.615
<i>I, uh...</i>

36:14.649 --> 36:16.850
<i>I always thought
I'd have something clever</i>

36:16.885 --> 36:20.120
<i>to say in this moment.</i>

36:20.155 --> 36:24.658
<i>You know, something pithy.</i>

36:24.693 --> 36:28.169
<i>Even a little ironic, but...</i>

36:29.998 --> 36:31.799
<i>Memorable.</i>

36:37.539 --> 36:40.265
<i>But I can't think of a fucking thing.</i>

36:41.509 --> 36:43.977
Oh, well.

36:49.684 --> 36:53.420
<i>Warning. Magnetic containment breach.</i>

36:56.807 --> 36:58.066
<i>Warning</i>.

36:58.067 --> 36:59.755
Shit, we have about ten minutes

36:59.780 --> 37:01.447
- until we're a fireball.
- We can't leave now.

37:01.481 --> 37:03.015
We've got to knock out
the rest of those pods.

37:03.050 --> 37:04.864
Alex, we're out of time.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.990
We'll find another way, I promise.

37:07.025 --> 37:09.293
You're welcome to stay with me, Martian.

37:09.327 --> 37:10.594
I'm good company.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.329
Goddamnit.

37:19.637 --> 37:21.538
I should have let him shoot you.

37:21.572 --> 37:22.939
<i>Warning, reactor failure imminent.</i>

37:26.978 --> 37:30.580
<i>Reactor failure imminent.</i>

37:37.989 --> 37:40.791
We've got to warn Mars.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.292
Of course we do. But that asshole

37:42.327 --> 37:45.495
on the bridge was right.
They may not get them all,

37:45.530 --> 37:47.564
and it will only take a few.

37:52.837 --> 37:55.772
I think I have a better idea.

37:57.575 --> 37:59.643
<i>Jim, Amos?</i>

37:59.677 --> 38:01.545
- You guys okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

38:01.579 --> 38:03.246
<i>We couldn't reroute all of the pods,</i>

38:03.281 --> 38:05.982
<i>but we were able to turn
their transponders back on.</i>

38:06.017 --> 38:07.684
<i>Mars can target them now,</i>

38:07.719 --> 38:10.487
but we're worried that
they may not get them all.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.222
- Holden.
- Go.

38:12.256 --> 38:14.358
And if they don't, they'll blame Earth,

38:14.392 --> 38:17.160
- and this war will just go on.
<i>- I know.</i>

38:17.195 --> 38:20.197
<i>There's a way that we can
shoot all the pods down</i>

38:20.231 --> 38:22.075
before they reach Mars.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.669
Fred Johnson.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.904
<i>He has the missiles he stole from Earth.</i>

38:27.939 --> 38:30.941
<i>He can destroy those pods.</i>

38:30.975 --> 38:32.676
You want to send their transponder codes

38:32.710 --> 38:34.010
to Fred Johnson.

38:34.045 --> 38:36.046
<i>Tycho is near their flight path.</i>

38:36.080 --> 38:39.216
He could kill a lot.
Maybe even all, if we're lucky.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.852
And if he shoots them down
before they reach Mars,

38:41.886 --> 38:43.587
then the attack never happened.

38:43.621 --> 38:46.690
<i>Maybe a path to peace for both sides.</i>

38:46.724 --> 38:48.592
If he captures them, we're handing him

38:48.626 --> 38:50.861
<i>Another weapon.</i>

38:50.895 --> 38:55.065
I want to do this,
but we all have to agree.

38:55.099 --> 38:56.733
All of us.

39:00.605 --> 39:03.673
All right, I'm in.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.178
It's worth a shot.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.082
I agree.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.764
<i>The fleets near Jupiter</i>

39:27.799 --> 39:29.299
<i>are sustaining
heavy losses on both sides.</i>

39:29.333 --> 39:31.802
<i>Reports of a mutiny somewhere early</i>

39:31.836 --> 39:33.603
<i>in the battle have not been confirmed.</i>

39:33.638 --> 39:35.305
<i>Meanwhile, MCRN...</i>

39:35.339 --> 39:38.108
<i>Fred, I think I might have a way</i>

39:38.142 --> 39:39.743
<i>for the Belt to strengthen its position</i>

39:39.777 --> 39:41.745
<i>as an equal player in the system,</i>

39:41.779 --> 39:43.647
<i>and also do some good.</i>

41:37.128 --> 41:40.497
You're not staying, are you?

41:43.901 --> 41:46.102
It's time.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.644
What the fuck is that?
