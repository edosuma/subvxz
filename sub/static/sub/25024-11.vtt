00:12.637 --> 00:14.931
[heartbeat thumping]

00:15.015 --> 00:18.101
[Jim panting]

00:18.184 --> 00:21.396
[dogs barking in distance]

00:33.199 --> 00:35.035
[door bangs, glass shatters]

00:35.452 --> 00:37.996
[echoing] Jim! Are you okay?

00:38.079 --> 00:39.080
-[Jim grunts]
-[crash]

00:40.040 --> 00:41.291
[theme music playing]

00:49.841 --> 00:50.717
[roars]

01:05.857 --> 01:07.275
[roaring]

01:10.528 --> 01:12.655
-Please, I implore you!
-[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts]

01:12.739 --> 01:14.741
Cease this brutality at once.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.827
He cannot stand it much longer.

01:18.286 --> 01:22.707
Let this be a lesson.
This is what happens to those who defy us!

01:24.542 --> 01:28.171
-Why won't you fight?
-Won't fight Krubera.

01:28.254 --> 01:34.260
They are my brothers.
They follow orders from traitor.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.512
[guards growl]

01:35.762 --> 01:37.764
Me? A traitor?

01:37.847 --> 01:40.558
It is you who turned your back
on your kind.

01:40.642 --> 01:41.643
[growls]

01:48.274 --> 01:50.944
It takes a leader
to know how to survive.

01:51.611 --> 01:55.406
When to strike,
and when to make sacrifices.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.910
Like when I traded you
to the Gumm-Gumms.

01:58.993 --> 02:02.413
No. Gunmar raided village.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.583
Took me away from family.

02:05.667 --> 02:09.169
Gunmar didn't kidnap you.
You were selected.

02:09.253 --> 02:13.383
The Skull Crusher needed an army.
I gave him a champion.

02:13.466 --> 02:18.221
What's the lives of a few younglings
when the Krubera could rule alongside him?

02:18.847 --> 02:23.601
You don't care for Krubera.
Just yourself.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.311
I am the Krubera!

02:25.895 --> 02:27.313
[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts]

02:27.397 --> 02:28.648
Aaarrrgghh!!!

02:28.731 --> 02:30.358
[screaming]

02:32.861 --> 02:34.237
[growling]

02:37.031 --> 02:38.575
How dare you interfere?

02:38.908 --> 02:42.078
Stand down. I command you.
[grunts]

02:42.203 --> 02:43.621
You betray your queen?

02:44.831 --> 02:48.293
You stupid brutes!
I'll make you pay. I'll make you--

02:48.376 --> 02:49.419
[screaming]

02:51.254 --> 02:55.133
Help me, help me, you idiots!
I will, I'll make you pay.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.135
[screaming, blubbering]

03:03.308 --> 03:05.226
[grunts] Aaarrrgghh!!!

03:07.020 --> 03:11.274
-Our queen led us astray.
-We have done terrible acts.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.235
Killed for Gunmar. We are bad.

03:14.319 --> 03:18.114
Bad trolls can change. I know.

03:18.197 --> 03:21.284
-Well said, old chum.
-Thank you, outsiders.

03:21.993 --> 03:25.872
If allies you came for,
many you have found.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.665
[all ululating]

03:32.462 --> 03:35.798
[Blinky] I'm sure Master Jim
will be thrilled to hear of our success.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.009
-We now have an army!
-A short one.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.093
Ha-ha!

03:39.177 --> 03:41.554
-Our luck is beginning to change.
-[sniffing]

03:41.638 --> 03:42.472
Aaarrrgghh!!!?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.557
Troll.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.309
-Come again?
-Troll!

03:46.809 --> 03:48.061
Aaarrrgghh!!!, wait!

03:51.105 --> 03:52.273
[snarls]

03:52.857 --> 03:53.733
Step back, please.

03:53.816 --> 03:57.028
Tell me exactly what you gave my son,
or heaven help me, I will...

03:57.111 --> 04:00.823
A concoction you won't find
in your medical books, I promise you.

04:00.907 --> 04:05.245
"Promise?" "Promise?"
You promised to help Jim.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.455
-What has happened?
-Ask the wizard.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.373
[Claire] Um...

04:08.456 --> 04:10.708
Guys? He's waking up.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.463
[groans]

04:16.172 --> 04:18.423
Great grumbly Gruesome.

04:18.507 --> 04:21.928
-Honey, do you feel okay?
-[Jim groans]

04:22.178 --> 04:24.514
-He's fine.
-We're not asking you.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.141
I... I'm fine.

04:27.225 --> 04:30.770
-Ah! What's wrong with my hand?
-Nothing's wrong with your hand.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.481
It's just a little meatier.

04:33.564 --> 04:37.110
In a good way. [chuckles]
It's like you leveled up.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.319
[Aaarrrgghh!!! sniffing]

04:40.738 --> 04:41.739
[grumbles]

04:41.823 --> 04:44.409
No like. No like Troll Jim.

04:44.784 --> 04:49.205
My elixir transformed our Trollhunter
into something not quite human,

04:49.289 --> 04:51.499
not quite troll.

04:51.582 --> 04:54.210
-[Jim] Like a Changeling?
-No.

04:54.294 --> 04:58.673
Changelings switch
from fully troll to fully human.

04:58.756 --> 05:02.093
Jim is... neither.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.388
-[Jim grunting]
-[pans clattering]

05:07.807 --> 05:08.725
Aah!

05:09.100 --> 05:12.103
This isn't so bad.
You know, after a little haircut,

05:12.186 --> 05:15.648
we'll find you some sunglasses,
maybe a good dentist, huh?

05:15.732 --> 05:16.858
I know one.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.111
-You'll be right back to normal.
-I'm hideous.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.696
You're really not.

05:22.613 --> 05:28.077
Hmm. Troll.
Jim is troll... like Aaarrrgghh!!!

05:28.161 --> 05:30.621
[laughing] Jim troll!

05:31.164 --> 05:35.543
Forgive Aaarrrgghh!!! He's emotional.
And I'm at a loss.

05:35.626 --> 05:39.672
-Why would you do this to him?
-To prepare him for the final battle.

05:39.756 --> 05:43.342
He is now capable of feats
we never thought possible.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.844
Like what?

05:45.178 --> 05:48.097
[Blinky] Now then, we don't know
the limits of Master Jim's...

05:48.181 --> 05:50.767
or should I say
"Troll Jim's" new form,

05:50.850 --> 05:53.644
-so let's try to take this slowly.
-[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Good one.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.481
[chuckling] Troll!

05:58.483 --> 06:00.568
[Aaarrrgghh!!! chuckling]

06:00.777 --> 06:03.237
-Are you even listening?
-Sorry.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.155
Master Jim?

06:05.656 --> 06:07.325
I didn't feel a thing!

06:07.408 --> 06:11.287
I like new Jim. Troll Jim. [grunts]

06:12.872 --> 06:15.750
I got you. Troll Jim strong.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.169
[grunts] Troll Jim fun.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.588
[both chuckling]

06:23.966 --> 06:28.096
Half Troll, full Hunter.
You're welcome.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.889
[Aaarrrgghh!!! and Jim grunt]

06:32.934 --> 06:36.395
All right, you two. Playtime is over.
We're burning night.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.690
Let's see what else
our new Trollhunter can do.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.692
[chuckling]

06:42.777 --> 06:44.612
Troll Jim best!

06:47.865 --> 06:51.327
He seems to be
handling this well, right?

06:52.453 --> 06:53.704
Sure.

06:54.705 --> 06:55.915
What's wrong?

06:56.582 --> 06:59.627
It took me years to handle
the diverse emotions

06:59.710 --> 07:02.046
of either troll or human,

07:02.130 --> 07:05.133
but I've never had to deal
with both at once.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.427
Walter, will I ever get my son back?

07:09.637 --> 07:10.680
[Barbara cries]

07:11.472 --> 07:13.724
But I've been wrong before. Ha.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.145
What do I know about being human?

07:19.730 --> 07:22.024
Fair Claire, the challenge is simple.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.611
Land a strike
on your beloved Trollhunter.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.489
No problem.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.242
Um...

07:31.325 --> 07:32.160
[crash]

07:32.243 --> 07:33.828
-[Claire grunts]
-Whoa.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.830
[fighting grunts]

07:37.707 --> 07:38.833
Yes!

07:38.916 --> 07:41.752
Up high. Down low. Ooh. Too slow.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.547
Gotta go!

07:45.256 --> 07:48.509
-[Jim] Am I moving too fast for you?
-Playing hard to get, huh?

07:52.013 --> 07:52.889
Huh.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.474
[fighting grunts]

07:55.600 --> 07:58.227
Ha-ha! [grunting]

08:10.156 --> 08:11.908
[panting, grunts]

08:11.991 --> 08:13.493
Huh?

08:13.576 --> 08:15.828
[groans]

08:15.912 --> 08:19.123
-Still haven't hit me.
-No kisses. We're fighting.

08:20.833 --> 08:26.214
Jim? I can still find you.
[effort grunting]

08:31.928 --> 08:32.761
[grunting]

08:39.936 --> 08:40.852
[growls]

08:40.937 --> 08:42.313
[growling]

08:45.525 --> 08:47.568
Our time has come!

08:48.027 --> 08:51.113
Our Eldritch Queen has awoken

08:51.197 --> 08:54.867
to give trollkind what is rightfully ours!

08:56.786 --> 08:58.079
[Gumm-Gumms roaring]

09:02.083 --> 09:05.378
[Morgana] You've suffered long enough
under man's rule.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.674
Today, the sacrifice of a few
will bring forth the Eternal Night

09:09.757 --> 09:13.427
-and your freedom!
-Sacrifice?

09:13.511 --> 09:18.266
Dwo Krost dan otzulak
aka emp el-kloka emp bruzi.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.399
Stop this madness!

09:34.448 --> 09:36.701
[Toby and Blinky gasp]

09:38.327 --> 09:41.080
You felt that, right?
That wasn't just my stomach grumbling?

09:41.163 --> 09:45.543
I fear those are grumblings of something
far more sinister than your digestion.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.048
-He didn't come back?
-I thought he was with you.

09:51.132 --> 09:55.803
He was so fast, I lost track of him.
I can't find him with the Staff.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.014
It's like it doesn't recognize him
anymore.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.516
-[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Uh-oh.
-[Blinky sighs]

10:01.684 --> 10:04.478
[grunts] Heh. Claire?

10:06.606 --> 10:07.732
Claire!

10:23.372 --> 10:24.874
[loud rumbling]

10:26.459 --> 10:27.293
[yelling]

10:31.672 --> 10:33.799
-Hm.
-Whoa.

10:43.643 --> 10:48.814
-[River troll] Troll.
-Troll? Not troll. Human.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.902
Not human.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.447
[pained grunts]

10:58.199 --> 11:01.952
No. Troll.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.416
[yells]

11:13.631 --> 11:16.258
Jimbo! Where are you?

11:17.593 --> 11:18.427
[grunts]

11:23.849 --> 11:24.809
[Wumpa] Huh?

11:26.685 --> 11:28.396
[gasps] Toby, watch out!

11:29.939 --> 11:34.151
-Sorry. Any sign of Jim?
-[sighs] Nothing.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.821
This is nuts.
How can he just disappear out of no--

11:36.904 --> 11:39.198
Hey, is that Merlin?

11:41.617 --> 11:43.953
-What's "Captain Crazy-Armor" doing now?
-Ugh!

11:45.162 --> 11:45.996
[gasps]

11:47.123 --> 11:48.374
It's uh...

11:50.418 --> 11:52.795
You! It's all your fault.

11:52.878 --> 11:56.173
Jim's vanished.
Now my Shadow Staff can't find him.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.634
Are you even listening to me?

11:58.717 --> 12:01.846
You can't find Jim
because there is no Jim.

12:01.929 --> 12:06.851
-At least, not the one you knew.
-Listen up, puzzlemaster-- [yells]

12:07.810 --> 12:10.646
I don't know what you did to him,
but when this is all over,

12:10.730 --> 12:12.064
you're turning him back.

12:12.648 --> 12:13.649
"Back"?

12:15.484 --> 12:18.279
There is no "back." It's permanent.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.574
You can't just turn my boyfriend
into a troll.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.702
"Boyfriend"?
Time for a status update, huh?

12:24.785 --> 12:25.870
Good for you.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.664
He's half-troll, half-boyfriend.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.624
[both gasp]

12:30.708 --> 12:31.750
Hmm.

12:32.960 --> 12:33.794
Mm.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.630
Oh, yes, yes.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.217
Gross! What's your deal, dude?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.636
You trolled Jim. You lick cement.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.347
Are there any other secrets
you're keeping from us?

12:45.723 --> 12:48.100
-Oh, plenty.
-Tell us.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.894
But then they wouldn't be secrets.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.021
[wobbly grunting]

12:52.104 --> 12:53.189
[gasping]

12:57.485 --> 12:59.528
Are those quakes coming from Trollmarket?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.031
Worse. Morgana.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.366
We need to find the Trollhunter.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.160
[trolls groaning]

13:08.871 --> 13:10.581
You've killed them.

13:10.664 --> 13:16.086
By the dust of our dead,
I shall deliver the Eternal Night.

13:20.299 --> 13:24.595
No, Walt, I called the school.
They haven't seen him either.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.597
I don't know.
Maybe he left a note or a--

13:26.680 --> 13:28.224
[pans clattering]

13:30.476 --> 13:33.354
Oh, hey, Mom.
I hope you brought your appetite.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.522
Jim? [scoffs]

13:35.022 --> 13:39.193
Okay, Walt, I found him.
Just please tell the others.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.821
You know, we have been looking
all over for you.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.491
Oh, sorry. Lost track of time.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.494
I thought I'd come home
and make us a nice dinner.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.495
Dinner can wait.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.874
Okay? You can't run off like that.
You had us all worried sick.

13:54.416 --> 13:58.128
-We should talk about this.
-Can it wait? I'm starving.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.424
Ugh! [chuckles]
Just needs more salt.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.803
It's delicious, honey.
There's nothing wrong with it.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.180
[retches]

14:08.556 --> 14:13.269
-You wanted to talk?
-Yeah, well, you've been through a lot.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.605
More than any one kid
should have to go through.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.441
-And you're my kid.
-Mmm.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.987
I just want to make sure
you are processing all of this.

14:25.614 --> 14:30.244
[swallows] I seem to have dropped my fork.
I'll go get another.

14:32.329 --> 14:36.000
Walter said it was confusing
to be human and troll...

14:36.083 --> 14:37.084
[sniffing]

14:37.167 --> 14:41.005
...but he still has the ability
to choose one or the other,

14:41.171 --> 14:44.758
and I'm just worried
about how you're adjusting.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.096
-[kitchenware rattling]
-Honey, is everything okay in there?

14:49.179 --> 14:51.599
[mouth full] It is totally fine.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.229
Jim! Are you eating the blender?

14:58.105 --> 15:01.567
[swallows] Uh... Not all of it.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.823
-Ugh... I just wanted a normal dinner!
-Jim.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.327
Mom, please!
I need some time to think.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.163
Jim. Honey, Jim. Wait!

15:16.874 --> 15:18.000
[sighs heavily]

15:27.259 --> 15:28.469
Hmm.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.474
[effort grunting]

15:38.395 --> 15:40.064
Come on. Come on.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.025
[yells, grunts]

15:43.943 --> 15:44.818
[roars]

15:47.237 --> 15:49.490
[grunting]

15:49.990 --> 15:52.701
-Walt? It's just like you said.
-[Jim] No! No!

15:52.785 --> 15:54.745
I don't recognize my son.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.914
Just-- just please come quickly.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.262
[groans]

16:25.567 --> 16:26.652
[growls]

16:29.947 --> 16:31.615
Jim, are you okay?

16:34.868 --> 16:36.286
[gasps]

16:38.998 --> 16:41.291
-[door slamming]
-[footsteps approaching]

16:42.710 --> 16:43.794
Barbara!

16:47.297 --> 16:49.591
Toby, it's Barbara.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.511
There's somewhere I need you to look.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.472
school bell rings]

16:58.350 --> 17:00.310
[Strickler] Which tactics specifically?

17:00.394 --> 17:03.355
-[Jim] The, uh, winning ones?
-[students laughing]

17:03.439 --> 17:05.315
[Strickler] All right. Don't forget my...

17:05.398 --> 17:10.529
[Strickler] Jim, if you fancy Miss NuÃ±ez,
I submit that talking to

17:10.612 --> 17:12.948
will be much more effective
than staring at.

17:13.031 --> 17:16.577
-[Jim] Blinky said we can bring you.
-[Claire] To Trollmarket? Seriously?

17:16.660 --> 17:18.162
When? Are we going now?

17:18.244 --> 17:21.205
[Jim] After school.
But try not to let the whole world know.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.499
-[Toby] Jim?
-[gasps]

17:23.333 --> 17:24.167
Jim?

17:25.085 --> 17:27.046
Jim? You in here?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.340
Jim?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.386
Jim?

17:41.268 --> 17:42.686
Jimbo!

17:47.900 --> 17:50.736
-[clang]
-[gasps] Is that you?

17:52.154 --> 17:53.322
Jim?

17:54.907 --> 17:57.826
-I know you're there. [gasps] Jim.
-[clang]

17:58.160 --> 17:59.286
[Jim growling]

18:00.370 --> 18:01.455
[snarls]

18:01.538 --> 18:05.918
It's okay. It's me. It's Tobes.
Look, if you just...

18:06.835 --> 18:08.796
-Toby!
-He's here!

18:10.130 --> 18:11.298
Jimbo?

18:13.258 --> 18:14.510
Jim, wait.

18:15.427 --> 18:20.432
Don't you get it?
I'm not Jim anymore. Go away. [snarls]

18:21.100 --> 18:22.309
He's going to the roof!

18:25.979 --> 18:27.898
[Strickler] There! I see him!

18:29.483 --> 18:30.359
[snarling]

18:47.626 --> 18:48.460
Jim.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.839
Please, Jim, don't run away.

18:52.840 --> 18:53.715
Whatever you are...

18:55.050 --> 18:55.884
I love you.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.763
[sighs deeply]

18:59.847 --> 19:00.806
[panting]

19:01.557 --> 19:05.310
I love you, too, Jimbo,
but let's talk on the ground.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.064
I'm just a tiny bit tired
of running after you.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.859
[Claire] I understand
what you're going through.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.277
You're not Jim anymore.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.280
But you're still someone
we all care about.

19:16.780 --> 19:21.243
I can't fight Gunmar
and be the person you want me to be.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.328
We're here on this roof for you.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.498
Especially me, man.
I just climbed three stories for you!

19:26.582 --> 19:28.959
And maybe you feel like
everything has changed,

19:29.042 --> 19:30.836
but only the outside stuff.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.839
Inside, you're still you.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.591
And we're better for it, Jimbo.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.594
-[sighs]
-[Toby] Maybe your old life is over,

19:38.677 --> 19:41.513
but that doesn't mean
we can't be a part of your new one.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.973
[door opening]

19:43.056 --> 19:43.932
[Strickler] Huh.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.976
Jim.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.644
We're here for you.

19:49.271 --> 19:53.901
I can't live in your world anymore.
I can't be in the daylight.

19:53.984 --> 19:57.404
-I can't eat dinner.
-But you can let us help you.

20:03.869 --> 20:04.703
[sighs]

20:06.371 --> 20:09.499
Master Jim.
Where are you going in such a hurry?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.210
[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Uh, help.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.671
There seems to be
something different about you.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.966
Why, with a few more eyes and arms,
we could be related.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.927
Troll brother.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.261
[chuckles]

20:23.597 --> 20:26.183
What am I, Blinky?

20:26.266 --> 20:28.393
When I gaze upon you,
do you know what I see?

20:29.811 --> 20:32.731
I see a champion. A friend.

20:33.857 --> 20:34.775
A son.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.320
A magnificent son.

20:43.617 --> 20:47.871
-I'm scared.
-Goodness gracious, who isn't?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.374
He'll be fine now.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.918
Hey, think of it this way.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.753
-You're like a Nougat Nummy.
-A what?

20:54.836 --> 20:59.132
You know, a sweet, velvety nougat mixed
with a crunchy chocolate cookie crumble.

21:00.592 --> 21:04.930
You're one part best friend,
one part new friend.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.598
Troll Jimbo.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.107
[Merlin] Splendid.

21:15.857 --> 21:21.530
Team Trollhunter is back together.
I knew you would all figure it out.

21:21.738 --> 21:24.616
Ah. This has been rather heartwarming,

21:24.700 --> 21:27.286
but unless you plan
to hug Gunmar to death,

21:27.369 --> 21:29.329
I advise we make ready

21:29.413 --> 21:34.334
because, as you say these days,
"the fight is on."

21:38.714 --> 21:41.633
Dwo Krost dan otzulak...

21:42.676 --> 21:46.888
