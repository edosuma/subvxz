00:17.484 --> 00:22.721
- So if he likes
your pic, he likes you?

00:22.723 --> 00:25.024
- Not necessarily, but
it's definitely a click

00:25.026 --> 00:26.925
in the right direction.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.194
- I would just say something.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.863
- Wait.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.899
Like, if you were me,
or you for me?

00:36.169 --> 00:38.670
- Umm.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.773
Both, I guess?

00:40.775 --> 00:44.810
- Okay, no pressure,
but what would you say?

00:47.681 --> 00:51.884
- I... well...

00:53.186 --> 00:54.553
Dear...

00:55.856 --> 00:56.688
Brennan...

00:58.925 --> 00:59.858
Earthquake!

01:16.776 --> 01:19.011
- They're supposed to stay
inside, we can't go in there!

01:19.013 --> 01:20.079
- The only safe place!

01:20.081 --> 01:21.380
- Sadie!

01:21.382 --> 01:22.214
Sadie!

01:23.183 --> 01:25.451
It's your turn to present.

01:28.721 --> 01:31.323
- And so, with science and
multiple religions agreeing,

01:31.325 --> 01:33.826
I think it's safe to say
the apocalypse prophecies

01:33.828 --> 01:36.395
should be taken seriously.

01:36.397 --> 01:39.231
- Sadie, once again, you've
misunderstood the assignment.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.900
It's supposed to be a study
on the effects of religious

01:41.902 --> 01:45.604
government on economy and
society.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.373
- Can there be any bigger
effect than the complete

01:48.375 --> 01:50.209
demolition of both?

01:50.211 --> 01:52.778
I started doing my research
and discovered what many other

01:52.780 --> 01:54.546
people already know.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.216
How can I not do my
part and educate others?

01:57.218 --> 01:59.451
I have produced some
literature to help you

01:59.453 --> 02:00.586
ready yourselves.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.689
If we prepare, we can make it!

02:06.760 --> 02:10.762
In 30 days, the world is
going to end as we know it!

02:24.777 --> 02:26.812
My name is Sadie Mitchell.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.382
I'm keeping this log
so if I don't make it,

02:30.384 --> 02:32.951
whomever inhabits this world
in the future will have a sense

02:32.953 --> 02:37.089
of who we were and learn
from our unpreparedness.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.593
Human beings are
creatures of great denial.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.832
But we also have a vast sense of
fear.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.469
The powers that be know this,
so they pepper our brain

02:50.471 --> 02:53.605
waves with war-this and
economy-that.

02:54.741 --> 02:57.676
And a big thank you to main
street media for providing us

02:57.678 --> 03:01.847
teenagers with a perpetual
sense of inadequacy.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.618
I'm the first to say that
all that fear-mongering

03:06.620 --> 03:09.555
is just to keep our senses
engaged.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.259
But this predates media.

03:14.261 --> 03:15.827
It's millennia old.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.967
31 more days, disaster
will strike the world over

03:21.969 --> 03:25.571
and prom queen or geek,
everyone's fucked.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.809
But I'm going to survive.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.345
I know this because what
started as a school assignment

03:33.347 --> 03:35.847
has become a minor distraction.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.786
♪ Someday maybe they'll
change you, change you ♪

03:40.788 --> 03:45.023
♪ But don't let, don't let 'em
lead you, lead you astray ♪

03:52.966 --> 03:54.733
- Afternoon, Sadie.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.302
Only one more month
till doomsday.

03:57.304 --> 04:01.740
- And seven hours, 42 minutes,
and 16 seconds.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.874
- Yeah, but like you've
already bought everything

04:02.876 --> 04:05.177
in the store, so if anybody's
gonna survive, it's you.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.846
I mean, other than me.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.848
Wait, have you thought of
something else?

04:09.850 --> 04:12.884
- Early Christmas presents,
since there won't be one.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.353
- You're caring.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.688
Sadie, I have a question
for you.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.322
If the Mayan calendar is right...

04:18.325 --> 04:20.826
- and the Egyptians,
the Ching Dynasty...

04:20.827 --> 04:23.862
- Yeah, to name a few,
but whose side are you on?

04:23.864 --> 04:27.499
- I think if I had to pick
an MVP, I'd go with science.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.768
It's winter solstice and the
earth will fall in direct

04:29.770 --> 04:32.738
alignment with the sun
and the milky way galaxy.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.673
The sun will lash out
huge solar flares,

04:34.675 --> 04:36.742
which will destroy our
protective magnetosphere

04:36.744 --> 04:39.745
that will trigger geomagnetic
storms that agitate

04:39.747 --> 04:42.714
the earth's core, followed by
the obvious.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.250
- Super volcanoes
and earthquakes!

04:45.252 --> 04:47.386
- And subsequent tsunamis.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.956
- I'm still on the fence
about the entire earth's crust

04:50.958 --> 04:54.359
shifting around the core,
seems a bit far-fetched to me.

04:54.361 --> 04:57.362
- Yeah, but either way, the
whole thing goes "Kablow".

04:57.364 --> 04:59.131
- Not us, though.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.633
We'll see each other
when the dust settles.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.901
- You know it.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.205
- Do you think if everyone
was this prepared,

05:07.207 --> 05:09.975
they could survive it too?

05:09.977 --> 05:13.211
- Yeah, more could than will,
though.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.746
Ten bucks.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.615
- Ring me up.

05:20.454 --> 05:24.256
I've decided before there's
nothing and no one left,

05:24.258 --> 05:27.959
I need to make a list of a few
things I should accomplish.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.962
I have all my supplies,
I need to learn to knit,

05:30.964 --> 05:34.666
how to cook, you know, practical
stuff for when it's just me

05:34.668 --> 05:38.003
and the obliterated countryside.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.807
There's some personal stuff,
now please don't discredit me

05:41.809 --> 05:44.443
as a hormonal adolescent, but
there'll be no room for being

05:44.445 --> 05:47.312
a teenager in
post-apocalyptic suburbia.

05:47.314 --> 05:50.849
I should probably go
to a high school party.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.653
And I'm barfing too.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.524
I wanna kiss a boy.

06:04.564 --> 06:08.767
But most importantly,
I need my comrade in arms.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.670
I don't wanna be
the sole survivor.

06:13.339 --> 06:16.108
I want my best friend back.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.409
And by my side.

06:42.835 --> 06:47.105
November 26th, today I begin
to prepare for the end.

06:52.378 --> 06:55.080
- Morning, sweetie, ready
for another big week?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.815
- One of the last!

06:56.817 --> 06:58.550
- I should never have let
you convert your bedroom

06:58.552 --> 07:00.719
into an impenetrable bunker.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.487
Your mother...

07:02.489 --> 07:03.889
- what about me?

07:03.891 --> 07:07.659
- Nothing, honey, just
commenting on your beauty.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.696
- Now, I don't hate my parents
like every other 16-year-old

07:11.698 --> 07:14.399
girl, I just don't respect them.

07:16.636 --> 07:20.605
Mom! Can you please make sure
dad keeps his survival kit

07:20.607 --> 07:22.874
in the car at all times?

07:22.876 --> 07:24.876
- He's so big and strong!

07:24.878 --> 07:28.914
- Oh, if Vera was in
pictionary, they'd draw me.

07:29.749 --> 07:32.184
- He's such a sucker
for the marketing of youth,

07:32.186 --> 07:34.352
but is borderline a pensioner.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.921
I should call him gramps.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.757
I mean, he acts like one,
gives me what I want before I

07:38.759 --> 07:41.893
can ask, takes zero
responsibility, and offers the

07:41.895 --> 07:45.564
occasional uninvited piece of
Sage advice.

07:47.366 --> 07:51.369
- Honey, when I was a kid,
we didn't have anxiety.

07:51.371 --> 07:52.437
You know?

07:52.439 --> 07:54.706
So if you put a little
less emphasis on Facebook

07:54.708 --> 07:57.375
and craigslist. Coming,
you'd actually breathe

07:57.377 --> 07:58.810
in some fresh air.

07:58.812 --> 07:59.945
- Craigslisting?

07:59.947 --> 08:01.880
- Yeah, it exists!

08:01.882 --> 08:02.948
- And my Mom.

08:02.950 --> 08:06.051
Her Australian accent is
about as flaky as she is.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.653
She's never been overly
maternal, a failed search

08:08.655 --> 08:11.823
for a surrogate led to a
very successful C-Section.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.958
Exhibit... Me.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.629
- Honey, I'm so proud of
you for trying that diet

08:17.631 --> 08:19.764
I told you about!

08:19.766 --> 08:22.601
- Mom, I'm on a rationing
dry run.

08:23.769 --> 08:25.904
- Well, you could market that.

08:25.906 --> 08:29.941
You can "half" it all!

08:31.811 --> 08:34.011
- Brennan might be coming over
after school, if that's okay.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.581
- She hasn't been over for ages,
that's wonderful.

08:37.351 --> 08:38.650
- Gotta go!

08:38.652 --> 08:40.118
Merry Christmas!

08:43.389 --> 08:44.222
Love you!

08:46.259 --> 08:48.026
- I try to be at school
right on time.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.296
Not early, not late, just the
minimum amount of time I have

08:51.298 --> 08:54.499
to spend in that
precarious structure.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.206
Hiya, Teddy.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.807
- Wotcher, Sadie!

09:05.278 --> 09:07.045
You would not believe
my morning.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.881
Wait, can't you smell it?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.616
Disaster's in the air.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.851
- Please don't.

09:12.853 --> 09:13.685
- What?

09:16.956 --> 09:18.223
One more month.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.624
- 26 days actually.

09:19.626 --> 09:24.396
- Hey, hey, hey, you can
see history class from here.

09:28.668 --> 09:31.836
- You know I can't walk
through the old part of school.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.038
- It's 40 feet.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.640
- And earthquakes happen
in an instant,

09:35.642 --> 09:37.342
I will see you there.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.746
- Sadie, I really liked
your presentation yesterday.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.915
I think this place is
due for a soft reset.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.252
- Right? Are you readying
yourself?

09:47.254 --> 09:52.290
- No, I'm too, like,
here, for preservation.

09:55.194 --> 09:56.461
- Hi, Brennan.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.563
- Sadie.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.766
- How you been?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.168
- Fine.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.738
- It's good, good, I'm glad.

10:08.474 --> 10:09.674
Oh!

10:11.110 --> 10:12.210
Here.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.478
- What's this?

10:14.714 --> 10:16.348
- Early Christmas presents
since there won't...

10:16.350 --> 10:17.682
- be another one.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.418
- Yeah.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.621
- Thanks.

10:25.791 --> 10:26.825
- Oh!

10:28.227 --> 10:30.228
- What's up, Sadie?

10:30.230 --> 10:31.696
- I can't walk that way.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.498
- We both have classes that way.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.867
- Yeah, I go up and around.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.669
- We'll be late for class.

10:37.671 --> 10:38.670
- We could jog.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.739
- I don't want to jog.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.877
- You wanna hang out at
my house this afternoon?

10:45.879 --> 10:47.379
- What?

10:47.381 --> 10:49.080
Sadie, you evaporate.

10:52.818 --> 10:57.022
You can't just ask me to
hang like it never changed.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.026
- I'm just scared.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.428
- And I have a life to live.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.366
- Brennan, who cares
about finding cool music

11:08.368 --> 11:11.936
or cute boys anymore when
it's all going to be over?

11:11.938 --> 11:14.506
- I have fears, too.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.108
I'm sorry they don't
"matter" matter,

11:17.110 --> 11:18.777
but high school is my world.

11:18.779 --> 11:22.747
This is everyone's world
here, and one hallway whisper

11:22.749 --> 11:25.750
and it could all end
any day too.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.888
You better run
if you wanna make class.

11:34.794 --> 11:35.927
Brennan and I thought we'd be

11:35.929 --> 11:37.662
best friends forever.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.567
She's always been the bold one.

11:45.905 --> 11:46.938
Brennan!

11:46.940 --> 11:48.740
Why are we running?

11:50.309 --> 11:51.409
You stole all those?

11:51.411 --> 11:52.777
We have to take them back!

11:52.779 --> 11:55.547
- No, they used to be five
cents and now the same candies

11:55.549 --> 11:56.614
are ten cents.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.450
You bought them, I did the math.

11:58.452 --> 12:00.485
- But we're gonna be in so much
trouble!

12:00.487 --> 12:01.586
- Not if we don't get caught.

12:01.588 --> 12:02.454
Come on!

12:03.422 --> 12:05.123
I was always the anxious one.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.727
- Today, we start
the rest of our lives.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.795
If I don't get a locker
in the yellow hall,

12:10.797 --> 12:12.230
I will die.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.468
Don't worry, you look amazing.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.636
- You see, the
thing about anxiety is it just

12:18.638 --> 12:22.440
makes you more anxious.
It's a vicious festering cycle.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.109
- We should probably just
get our schedules first.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.176
- Okay.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.311
Your chest gets tighter,

12:26.313 --> 12:28.646
your stomach twistier,
your head smushier.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.750
- This is it, Sadie,
we're sophomores now,

12:31.752 --> 12:33.685
and you're coming with me
to this party this weekend.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.520
- I already have so much reading
to do.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.922
- Oh, I read, I get good grades,
but I also made out

12:37.924 --> 12:39.357
with Paul last weekend!

12:39.359 --> 12:42.594
Everyone saw. I got, like,
seven new followers on Sunday.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.495
Come on!

12:43.497 --> 12:44.529
Come have some fun!

12:44.531 --> 12:46.097
- I have fun!

12:46.099 --> 12:47.665
- Because we're not
minor niners anymore.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.634
We could be great.

12:49.636 --> 12:50.635
- We always have been great.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.669
- B!

12:51.671 --> 12:53.505
- Roberta banana!

12:53.507 --> 12:54.739
Come on.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.676
Well, I'm gonna be great.

13:03.516 --> 13:07.752
You find new interests,
and disinterests.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.793
- Hey.

13:16.028 --> 13:16.828
Who?

13:17.830 --> 13:19.998
I think that's out of
my cool range.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.400
Plus, I'm kinda busy
with that bedroom Reno.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.804
It's not a joke, Bren!

13:26.872 --> 13:29.307
Why don't you come over
tomorrow and check it out?

13:30.509 --> 13:32.777
Well, maybe's better than no.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.313
Yeah.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.614
'Kay, bye.

13:41.655 --> 13:45.223
Different languages, and the
words have been put through

13:45.225 --> 13:47.325
Google translate so many
times that their meaning

13:47.327 --> 13:48.793
is completely lost.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.252
So maybe right now,
Brennan doesn't want

14:14.254 --> 14:16.855
anything to do with me.

14:16.857 --> 14:20.091
But there's still
a lot to accomplish.

14:21.427 --> 14:22.794
Ms. nickel,
my teacher I eat lunch

14:22.796 --> 14:25.730
at the park near school with,
is showing me how to knit.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.599
I'm supposed to call her Connie.

14:27.601 --> 14:29.601
- Surprised you came to
me to learn how to knit.

14:29.603 --> 14:32.871
Nothing says "Connie" like
boring, scratchy wool.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.539
I like Connie,

14:34.541 --> 14:35.907
but she makes me think
that maybe it's better

14:35.909 --> 14:38.243
I don't grow up in this world.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.477
She's engaged.

14:39.479 --> 14:43.381
They both have good jobs,
but she seems lonely at school.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.284
And her lunches are more
depressing than mine.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.889
I've mastered everything
from Cornish game hens

14:50.891 --> 14:52.790
to Creme Brûlée.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.659
I figure being skilled
with a blowtorch

14:54.661 --> 14:56.895
is a double whammy.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.931
I also explored
survivalist cuisine.

15:02.101 --> 15:07.005
I even skipped a class,
by an accidental sleep-in.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.440
I hate this rickety bridge.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.477
I'm gonna be home a bit late.
I got detention.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.446
- Wow, that's great, so normal.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.148
- What's normal?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.349
- Sadie, sort of.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.119
Maybe she'll even use
our abandoned pool.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.588
- Yeah, so when
a 9.9 earthquake hits,

15:23.590 --> 15:25.657
I can instantly drown.

15:26.692 --> 15:29.560
- Chlorine's bad for your hair,
anyway, honey.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.499
- Thanks, Mom.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.135
Well, this was very rewarding
family time,

15:37.137 --> 15:39.671
but I gotta go.
See ya later.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.442
But on the Richter scale
of my list,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.811
I've barely felt a tremble.

15:48.847 --> 15:50.515
I haven't gone to a party.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.017
I don't venture anywhere
unnecessary.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.186
- Sadie, I'm spinning at
mod night this weekend,

15:55.188 --> 15:58.623
you've got to come,
you lonesome dove.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.158
- 11 days to the Armageddon,
it's my last weekend

16:00.160 --> 16:01.492
to get everything organized.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.261
- Oh, don't be such a potato!

16:03.263 --> 16:06.030
Say, do you cool cats
wanna twist your hips

16:06.032 --> 16:07.165
this weekend?

16:09.702 --> 16:13.438
- Is this gonna be, like,
weird music my dad listens to?

16:13.440 --> 16:14.539
- Possibly.

16:15.674 --> 16:19.377
- Okay, well, I'll, uh, make
sure to check my calendar.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.652
- Blimey, as if your
doomsday paraphernalia

16:27.654 --> 16:30.521
wasn't perfectly in check.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.458
Alright, well your name's
at the door as always.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.662
Nope, definitely haven't
kissed a boy.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.997
- Toodle-pip.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.832
Say, have you heard...

16:43.802 --> 16:46.037
- And I don't
have my best friend back.

16:49.775 --> 16:50.842
Hi.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.010
- Hey, Sadie.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.887
Not an obvious stain, which
is worse because people stare

17:02.889 --> 17:05.757
trying to figure out if
it is, in fact, a stain.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.258
- Lighting?
- Bummer.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.760
- But worse than the stain
is the smell.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.328
I smell like brine.

17:10.329 --> 17:13.931
- And on top of that,
or maybe that is on top of this,

17:13.933 --> 17:16.200
Calvin and I,
I think we're done.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.367
- You think?

17:17.369 --> 17:20.938
- Well, we broke up,
but it's not instantaneous.

17:20.940 --> 17:25.777
- No, it's like, a wavering
Jenga Tower, kind of.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.845
We don't carefully
dismantle what we built.

17:27.847 --> 17:31.716
We'll both just be left
with heaps of rubble.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.620
- Maybe you can try and
slide a piece or two back in.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.288
- We'll try.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.556
We always try.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.592
Update me on the list.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.895
- I've gotten nowhere on
the personal side of things.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.930
- Sadie, I told you that you
have to try...

17:45.932 --> 17:49.901
- I know, I know, but as much
as I'd like to have fun

17:49.903 --> 17:52.036
and participate in my
adolescence, the mere thought

17:52.038 --> 17:53.871
of it makes me nauseous.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.973
Like I'll screw up,
or it'll screw me up.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.776
- Now, I am no certified
guidance counselor or anything,

17:58.778 --> 18:01.779
but I think that's
a normal feeling to have.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.781
- But for me, it's debilitating.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.451
I'm sure getting wasted
and blotto is a hoot, but...

18:06.453 --> 18:09.087
- no one's gonna get wasted
with you if you say "hoot".

18:10.889 --> 18:13.825
- But that loss of control
feels like it'll crush me.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.560
I think if I can just
get Brennan back,

18:15.562 --> 18:18.563
then I can at least get my
proverbial foot in the door.

18:18.565 --> 18:23.234
We were so close forever,
but then my usual anxiety

18:23.236 --> 18:29.240
morphed into this, and I
guess we drifted apart.

18:29.242 --> 18:32.410
- I think maybe
you drifted away.

18:37.416 --> 18:38.950
- Yeah.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.619
But she turned
into someone else, too.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.088
I just wish I could fix it.

18:44.090 --> 18:47.091
Or that we could start
a new game of Jenga

18:47.093 --> 18:49.227
and not remove a single piece.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.263
- Maybe it's
a different game now.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.379
- Jack, just barely made it.

19:19.959 --> 19:24.896
- Please, make use
of your time here.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.408
- So, whatcha get busted for?

19:38.343 --> 19:39.677
- Skipped.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.779
- Oh, bad-ass.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.482
- Mm, no, I slept in.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.249
You?

19:46.385 --> 19:50.321
- Well, I painted the inside
of my locker hunter green.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.323
- Why would you do that?

19:52.325 --> 19:54.926
- Well, I wasn't gonna
paint it chartreuse.

19:59.231 --> 20:02.700
- I saw you with
Brennan Chartrin today, right?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.335
- Uh, yeah.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.572
- So, are you, like,
in that clique now?

20:07.574 --> 20:10.107
- In that clique now?

20:10.109 --> 20:11.876
This isn't a lunchroom
movie scene,

20:11.878 --> 20:14.011
that's not really a thing.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.814
Aren't you, or were,
best friends?

20:17.950 --> 20:21.252
- Yeah, but stuff happened.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.255
- Like what kind of stuff?

20:25.190 --> 20:27.758
I'm prying, go on.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.095
- I did this project
about natural disasters, and...

20:32.364 --> 20:34.398
it consumed me.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.733
The end.

20:36.535 --> 20:38.736
So now I wear this vest
every day,

20:38.738 --> 20:43.808
I guess I was always,
air-quotes, prone to anxiety.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.843
- Well, I like the vest.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.813
It's very vintage-y.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.584
- Fashion.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.754
It's where I keep my
field supplies, you know?

20:56.756 --> 21:00.625
Flashlight, iodine tablets,
reflective blanket,

21:00.627 --> 21:02.260
whistle, the basics.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.963
- So, the 21st, huh?

21:08.033 --> 21:11.068
It's all gonna be over.
Why worry now?

21:11.070 --> 21:12.803
- Because it's happening now!

21:12.805 --> 21:15.473
Natural disasters went up
150 per year in the '80s

21:15.475 --> 21:17.808
and now it's up to 370.
It's like the planet's

21:17.810 --> 21:19.610
warming up to bat!

21:19.612 --> 21:21.412
I don't wanna get caught
off-guard before the big one.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.047
Then there's the Apocalypse,
the fish dying...

21:23.049 --> 21:24.415
- so, how does it work?

21:24.417 --> 21:28.319
- Well, the winter solstice happens
on December 21st, like, once a...

21:28.321 --> 21:30.988
- no, no, I mean like, your
life, how does it work now?

21:32.791 --> 21:34.925
- I go to school.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.662
But I spend as little time
in the building as possible.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.130
I wait outside
until the last Moment

21:39.132 --> 21:40.765
and enter as the bell rings.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.700
- Sounds good, less school.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.136
- Except I can't go in the
old part of the building.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.504
- Well, I mean,
it's too dangerous!

21:46.506 --> 21:47.872
- Exactly!

21:47.874 --> 21:50.174
Most important, when inside I
always know my exit strategies

21:50.176 --> 21:52.677
and have at least three
land routes home.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.745
- Okay, right now,
what would we do?

21:54.747 --> 21:56.881
- Well, main library door's
the closest,

21:56.883 --> 21:58.849
but the turnstiles could get
twisted and present a problem.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.885
You'd think the back fire exit,

22:00.887 --> 22:03.287
I don't like
those top-heavy stacks.

22:03.289 --> 22:04.288
Nope.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.690
Through the office,
out the faculty exit,

22:05.692 --> 22:08.826
that's for me, then it's a
straight-shot to the front doors.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.127
- Wow.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.929
And outside is better?

22:13.965 --> 22:17.535
- Of course, no falling beams,
shards of glass,

22:17.537 --> 22:18.669
you have to watch out
for the trees, though,

22:18.671 --> 22:19.737
I mean, unless you can get
to my house,

22:19.739 --> 22:21.339
then my bunker's
the safest place I know of.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.740
That's where I'll be.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.575
- Wait, your what now?

22:26.511 --> 22:29.880
- I converted my bedroom
into a bunker.

22:30.982 --> 22:34.752
- Well, you showed up
and I got Pilates, so...

22:45.764 --> 22:47.098
- To the bunker?

22:47.100 --> 22:48.866
- Huh?

22:48.868 --> 22:52.169
- Well, when the time comes I'm not
just gonna run blindly into this oasis.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.938
I gotta make sure
it's up to scratch.

22:55.907 --> 22:57.274
- Okay.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.754
- Wow!

23:09.756 --> 23:11.789
This is kind of awesome!

23:14.893 --> 23:17.261
- Makes me feel secure.

23:17.263 --> 23:18.729
Gives me hope.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.231
- These air tanks?

23:20.233 --> 23:21.799
- If the water doesn't recede
after the Tsunami,

23:21.801 --> 23:23.934
I'll need air to surface.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.170
Life raft.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.072
- Wow.

23:29.574 --> 23:34.478
Man, I wish I thought... or,
knew, the world was gonna end.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.948
Look at this guy!

23:37.950 --> 23:40.751
- More people need to prepare.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.919
- Well, no.

23:42.888 --> 23:47.258
I mean, if it's all gonna end,
then, so what?

23:47.260 --> 23:50.661
Then I wouldn't have
to worry about everything.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.730
Wouldn't have to worry
about getting good grades,

23:52.732 --> 23:54.765
so I can get
into a good college,

23:54.767 --> 23:56.801
so I can get an SUV
instead of a minivan,

23:56.803 --> 23:58.969
so I can still feel like
I have some control

23:58.971 --> 24:00.538
in my life.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.473
I could travel.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.576
Or I could just sleep in
and not feel

24:05.578 --> 24:07.845
so guilty about it, you know?

24:08.747 --> 24:09.847
Just feel free.

24:11.016 --> 24:13.317
- Believe me,
doesn't make you feel free

24:13.319 --> 24:15.653
or I wouldn't have my list.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.254
- Your what, now?

24:18.123 --> 24:20.958
- It's okay, you can go.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.960
Don't waste your inner monologue
on me.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.096
"How did I end up in this
crazy girl's bunker?

24:26.098 --> 24:27.598
How can I get out?"

24:27.600 --> 24:31.702
- Trust me, that's not what
my inner monologue is saying.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.405
What's, what's this list?

24:35.373 --> 24:38.275
- Things to be completed
before the world ends.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.444
- Oh, well, I think we all
have one of those bouncing

24:40.446 --> 24:42.713
around in the back of our heads.
It's called a bucket list.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.848
- Not a bucket list.

24:43.850 --> 24:47.218
It's a list for before
everyone else dies.

24:47.220 --> 24:48.819
- Dark.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.987
Alright.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.489
Let's hear it.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.600
Time capsule?

25:11.309 --> 25:14.512
- I can cross detention
off the list.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.986
Go to a high school party,
sneak into a bar,

25:21.988 --> 25:23.921
get my best friend back...

25:23.923 --> 25:24.855
- Sadie, you know...

25:28.593 --> 25:30.895
Sadie, you know what would
make this list

25:30.897 --> 25:32.029
a lot easier?

25:32.898 --> 25:36.567
Is if you just, you know,
let loose. Okay?

25:37.569 --> 25:40.471
Let yourself feel free.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.778
You know,
I think we can do this.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.216
- We?
- Yeah, I wanna help.

25:56.121 --> 26:00.591
- I, I think I need to
revise the list anyway.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.226
Brennan looks at me like
I'm a bug-eyed hermit

26:02.228 --> 26:04.461
crawling out of the woods.

26:04.463 --> 26:06.130
She snubbed me.
That's not a friend.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.264
- What?

26:07.266 --> 26:08.933
Oh, come on.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.068
I mean, sure, Brennan might
have turned into a bit of

26:11.070 --> 26:14.605
a tumbler-scrolling stereotype,
but I mean,

26:14.607 --> 26:16.740
you kinda just
faded into the small print

26:16.742 --> 26:18.609
without even saying goodbye.

26:19.744 --> 26:23.080
If you want this fixed,
it's kind of up to you, Sadie.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.816
Luckily, you have me.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.352
- You can't say anything to her.

26:28.354 --> 26:31.288
- Oh, I wasn't planning
on doing the talking.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.625
I was just gonna throw you
into the fire.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.193
- Terrifying.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.902
- Bunker girl, stop looking
so lonely.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.837
- Says the man with no friends.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.138
- You're right.

26:48.140 --> 26:51.275
I am a man and I choose not to
befriend these philistines!

26:51.277 --> 26:54.244
They don't get me, nay,
and I don't get them.

26:54.246 --> 26:57.848
I've got mates,
they're just not at the school.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.950
- Debating whether or not sting
was the right casting choice

26:59.952 --> 27:03.821
at <i>quadrophenia</i> in the record
store is not friendship.

27:03.823 --> 27:04.989
- Venomous.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.690
Are you out to destroy
all your relationships,

27:06.692 --> 27:08.759
or you taking a piss?

27:08.761 --> 27:09.994
I'm joshing.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.162
- I've got it.
- Chlamydia?

27:12.164 --> 27:13.197
- What? No.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.898
- I hear it's going around.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.670
- So, a bunch of people
including Brennan

27:19.672 --> 27:21.639
are headed to the beach
after school.

27:21.641 --> 27:24.141
It's like a group thing,
like dogs, right?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.210
Once you guys get used to
being around each other

27:26.212 --> 27:30.614
and intentions lighten,
we'll get you off your leash.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.149
- I can't go to the beach,

27:32.151 --> 27:33.851
nor am I a canine.

27:33.853 --> 27:34.885
- Why, why not?

27:34.887 --> 27:36.320
It's outside,
I thought outside was okay.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.956
If I may, proximity to water,

27:38.958 --> 27:41.158
unseen underwater earthquakes,
the water recedes

27:41.160 --> 27:44.028
at a rapid rate
and it's too late.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.698
- My mediator's succinct.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.033
Sorry.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.367
But thank you.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.870
- Challenge accepted, Sadie.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.172
Anyway, I gotta hand in
this paper before nine

27:55.174 --> 27:57.675
so I can apply
to some far-off institution

27:57.677 --> 27:59.810
that will define what I do
for the rest of my days,

27:59.812 --> 28:02.713
all before I can vote,
by the way.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.715
Or I'll get grounded.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.017
Brainstorm Sesh after school?

28:07.019 --> 28:08.352
In the bunker?

28:08.354 --> 28:09.520
- Okay.

28:14.092 --> 28:17.161
- So, Jack Daniels just
pops over to the batcave

28:17.163 --> 28:18.495
all of a sudden.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.664
- His last name is Diaz,
and he's helping me

28:20.666 --> 28:22.833
figure things out with Brennan.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.902
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.105
It's go time!

28:30.909 --> 28:32.209
Hi!

28:32.211 --> 28:34.111
- I'm gonna be alone
for the rest of my life.

28:34.113 --> 28:37.214
- I got home last night and
Calvin's clothes were gone,

28:37.216 --> 28:38.916
like he caught me cheating,
which I didn't,

28:38.918 --> 28:40.217
and then there was
this note there saying,

28:40.219 --> 28:41.852
"have fun on the Cabo trip!"

28:41.854 --> 28:43.520
Our Christmas Cabo trip!

28:43.522 --> 28:44.922
It's so dramatic!

28:44.924 --> 28:46.790
Like, if we're growing apart,
it should be slow,

28:46.792 --> 28:50.627
depressing,
no grand malevolent gestures.

28:50.629 --> 28:51.895
Don't put all your eggs
in one basket

28:51.897 --> 28:53.464
so early in life like I did,
Sadie.

28:53.466 --> 28:55.132
Or they'll go bad,
you won't be able to procreate,

28:55.134 --> 28:57.534
and no one will want you.

28:57.536 --> 29:00.771
I'm kidding.
Your eggs have decades,

29:00.773 --> 29:03.640
and young love is a
beautiful passionate thing.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.778
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

29:07.780 --> 29:09.246
- Not really.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.115
- What about
that Teddy pipsqueak?

29:11.117 --> 29:14.051
- Oh, no no no,
he's just a hall friend.

29:14.053 --> 29:17.221
But I do have a new boy friend!

29:17.223 --> 29:19.556
- Who?
- Jack Diaz.

29:19.558 --> 29:24.461
- Oh, yeah, disarmingly charming,
funny, but not, "I'm funny."

29:24.463 --> 29:25.829
Teacher crush.

29:25.831 --> 29:27.931
Please, they have 'em
in elementary school.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.768
- He's helping me
get Brennan back.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.436
- Is that all?

29:32.438 --> 29:33.570
- Yeah.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.411
- Okay.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.614
So, the green are safe zones?

29:43.616 --> 29:44.748
- Yeah.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.350
- And the red are no fly zones.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.951
- Mm-hm.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.620
- Okay, well I'll just take
the old part of the school

29:49.622 --> 29:51.121
and the cafeteria,
and you just take

29:51.123 --> 29:52.956
the new part of the school.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.192
- So, we just follow her?

29:55.194 --> 29:56.994
It seems a bit creepy.

29:57.996 --> 30:00.931
- Do you use the Internet?

30:00.933 --> 30:05.536
Creeping is, like, like a
hallmark teenage pastime.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.504
It's reconnaissance.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.640
Now, if only
we had walkie-talkies.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.342
- You do realize
who you're dealing with?

30:13.211 --> 30:15.479
- Of course
you have walkie-talkies.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.285
- So are people actually going
to that kid Teddy's mod party?

30:21.287 --> 30:24.521
- Honestly, I don't really care!

30:24.523 --> 30:25.889
- The marsupial's on the move.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.726
- Marsupial?

30:29.728 --> 30:31.829
It's too many syllables.

30:33.064 --> 30:35.365
- The possum's on the move.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.837
- Perfect.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.706
- Still a marsupial.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.842
- I have a visual.

30:44.844 --> 30:45.876
- Is mod a thing?

30:45.878 --> 30:47.544
Like, is it coming back?

30:47.546 --> 30:48.846
- When was it here?

30:48.848 --> 30:51.381
- Isn't it 21 and over?

30:51.383 --> 30:54.484
- That does give it a
Monday morning bad-ass cred.

30:54.486 --> 30:58.388
It's kind of crazy how he DJs
at a bar when he's only 17.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.691
- I don't think we have time
to go to the bean today.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.993
Should we just grab a
drink in the cafeteria?

31:04.329 --> 31:07.264
- Well, let's make it quick. I
don't wanna be seen in the Caf!

31:07.266 --> 31:09.199
Bean, def tomorrow!

31:12.537 --> 31:14.438
- Think we found
our possum's tree.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.683
Holy... where'd you get this?

31:26.685 --> 31:28.452
- It's my dad's.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.953
- What was he,
an action hero or something?

31:29.955 --> 31:31.221
- Nah, a mid-life crisis.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.690
Just gotta make sure
I don't Bueller this thing.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.225
- No, I don't wanna get ya
in trouble.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.027
- Ah, don't worry about it.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.729
When your dad places
all his unfulfilled dreams

31:38.731 --> 31:41.865
on your shoulders, you're
kind of always in trouble.

31:41.867 --> 31:42.799
- I didn't realize that...

31:42.801 --> 31:44.935
- alright, so,
have you thought about

31:44.937 --> 31:46.536
what you're gonna say?

31:46.538 --> 31:50.774
- Umm, I'm gonna talk
things through with her?

31:50.776 --> 31:53.944
- Long verbose declamation,
or short and earnest?

31:53.946 --> 31:55.312
- I didn't plan a speech.

31:55.314 --> 31:56.313
- Spontaneity!

31:56.315 --> 31:58.081
Straight from the heart.
I like it!

32:00.985 --> 32:02.219
Good luck.

32:05.156 --> 32:06.890
- So I checked the hashtag
everywhere,

32:06.892 --> 32:09.559
and mod definitely has a "nobody's
doing it" type of feel,

32:09.561 --> 32:11.662
but nobody's doing it.

32:13.965 --> 32:16.900
- Are, uh, you girls heading
to the bean?

32:16.902 --> 32:18.502
- Yeah.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.904
- Uh, well, I only have room
for one.

32:20.906 --> 32:22.739
Brennan, you want to ride along?

32:22.741 --> 32:24.741
- Oh!
- Oh.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.343
- Uh, sure.

32:32.250 --> 32:35.185
- Oh, my god.
- Good for her.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.054
- No. Good for her, totally.

Not for each other.

Double-suey.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.395
Shit, not supposed
to suggest suicide to students.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.362
Especially not one
who's obsessed

34:26.364 --> 34:27.898
with the world's
population dying.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.367
It's my obsession
with everyone dying

34:30.369 --> 34:33.402
that nurtures my extreme will
to survive.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.705
- Phew, that could've been
a lawsuit.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.040
- And you'd feel bad.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.574

34:40.110 --> 34:41.110
So you were sucking?

34:41.112 --> 34:42.612
Oh my god,
I have to stop doing that.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.982
- I can't figure it out!

34:45.984 --> 34:48.819
It's like I don't know how to
have relationships anymore!

34:48.821 --> 34:50.420
As soon as I get a Moment
to talk to Brennan,

34:50.422 --> 34:52.289
I just filled
with so much anxiety

34:52.291 --> 34:55.058
and shrank into nothingness!

34:55.060 --> 34:56.793
- On the flip side,
I called Calvin last night.

34:56.795 --> 35:00.997
Bared my soul, blubbered, wailed,
and I think I even gag-heaved.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.834
There's no green side
on our lawn.

35:26.023 --> 35:28.925
- It's the Friday
before the final Friday,

35:28.927 --> 35:31.962
and I resigned myself to myself.

35:31.964 --> 35:34.197
They don't need me
and I don't need them.

35:34.199 --> 35:36.333
There's a lot to be done.

35:39.637 --> 35:40.837
I know weeks from now
I'll be digging

35:40.839 --> 35:43.540
through rubble, hopelessly
searching for survivors.

35:47.778 --> 35:48.945
And I'll have to make peace
with the fact

35:48.947 --> 35:51.781
that I didn't sort
things out with Brennan.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.818
But I might as well get
ready for a life of solitude.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.886
At least I'll have a life.

35:59.657 --> 36:00.924
- And that is Uranus.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.192
You got it?

36:02.194 --> 36:05.629
Neptune is the outermost planet
and the third most massive.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.831
It's similar to Uranus
but it's a darker blue color.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.167
Alright, fire alarm.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.501
Let's line up at the front
of the class for a headcount.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.170
- Excuse me!
- Sadie, let's wait for the class.

36:13.172 --> 36:15.405
- My way's more efficient!

36:42.767 --> 36:44.367
- Sadie!

36:44.369 --> 36:45.335
Sadie, Sadie, it's okay!

36:45.337 --> 36:50.540
It's not your responsibility.
You can't... you don't have to...

36:50.542 --> 36:53.009
- shhh, it's just a false alarm.
- It's okay.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.477
- I'm sorry.

36:55.513 --> 36:57.214
- It's okay. I get it.

36:58.583 --> 37:04.054
- No, I got so wrapped up,
I didn't know I lost you.

37:04.056 --> 37:07.190
And then when I did,
it was too late.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.230
- You don't think I missed you
too?

37:13.232 --> 37:15.232
I couldn't wait forever.

37:21.339 --> 37:24.808
- You! You!

37:26.110 --> 37:29.613
- Slow down!

37:29.615 --> 37:32.315
- I thought I was gonna die!

37:32.317 --> 37:34.618
- Wait, you orchestrated this?

37:34.620 --> 37:36.052
That's so sweet!

37:38.022 --> 37:39.122
I guess I can still hang
with someone

37:39.124 --> 37:41.925
who doesn't have
a yellow locker.

37:46.797 --> 37:49.032
- You pulled the fire alarm,
and I get

37:49.034 --> 37:51.368
a full lunch detention
on Wednesday.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.802
- You totally deserved it.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.738
- Hey, look, I risked my
baby-making bits

37:54.740 --> 37:57.007
pulling that one, alright?

37:58.809 --> 38:00.410
- Connie, come join us!

38:00.412 --> 38:02.379
- You're gonna get detention
for that one, Sade.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.880
- Later.

38:03.882 --> 38:07.384
- Um, you call Ms. nickel
by her first name, Sade?

38:07.386 --> 38:08.852
- We eat lunch together.

38:08.854 --> 38:11.755
She's a bit quirky,
but I like her.

38:12.723 --> 38:14.858
- I can't believe
you guys did all that.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.894
And thanks, Jack, for
pushing her off the cliff.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.562
- Nah, she jumped.

38:21.565 --> 38:23.733
She's gonna do it.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.336
Oh my god, she's gonna do it!

38:26.338 --> 38:28.805
Yeah, Crustaceous Rose!

38:28.807 --> 38:31.741
That's the darkest shade yet!

38:31.743 --> 38:36.613
Been practicing.

38:37.748 --> 38:40.183
- 'Kay, so, it's Friday.

38:40.185 --> 38:41.918
What should we do tonight?

38:41.920 --> 38:44.888
- I say we each commit
three dollars and see

38:44.890 --> 38:47.991
who can find the weirdest,
slash funniest, buys

38:47.993 --> 38:49.559
at 99 cent store.

38:52.029 --> 38:54.764
- Or, we could stay
in the bunker!

38:54.766 --> 38:58.068
Hazard vest, huh?

38:58.070 --> 39:00.036
So funny, slash weird!

39:00.038 --> 39:02.205
- Sadie, outside is okay.

39:05.576 --> 39:08.011
- It's an unnecessary excursion.

39:08.013 --> 39:12.749
- Sade, remember how we got so
bored lying around our rooms

39:12.751 --> 39:15.652
we'd take an hour and a
half to walk the four blocks

39:15.654 --> 39:17.387
and back to the dollar store?

39:17.389 --> 39:18.388
- Yeah.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.756
- Well, the longer we take
to get there,

39:19.758 --> 39:21.391
the closer we are to the bunker,

39:21.393 --> 39:22.692
and when we get there
we'll know the bunker

39:22.694 --> 39:24.661
is just a few blocks away.

39:27.064 --> 39:29.332
- And so here's the real kicker.

39:30.134 --> 39:32.802
My Mom threw out
my lucky underwear!

39:32.804 --> 39:34.938
My lucky pair!
They're gone.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.140
- That actually is the most
embarrassing first ever date.

39:37.142 --> 39:38.942
- Well, aren't they all?

39:38.944 --> 39:40.610
Sadie, what's yours?

39:40.612 --> 39:45.348
- Oh, um, I actually
haven't been on a date.

39:46.784 --> 39:48.818
- Mine was pretty awful.

39:50.621 --> 39:53.690
- Soda Sam?

39:53.692 --> 39:56.926
- Yeah, I had the hugest crush
on Sam.

39:56.928 --> 40:00.964
Like, school started and
he was a different person.

40:00.966 --> 40:03.099
So, a bunch of us were going
to the movies

40:03.101 --> 40:04.667
but Sam asked me to go with him.

40:04.669 --> 40:07.337
- The one where the girl
takes off her glasses

40:07.339 --> 40:08.505
and she's hot.

40:08.507 --> 40:09.973
- Gotcha.

40:09.975 --> 40:13.643
- I'm excited and nervous
and have all the feels.

40:13.645 --> 40:16.679
So, Sam and I sit two rows
away from everyone else.

40:16.681 --> 40:17.781
- Wait, and you were there?

40:17.783 --> 40:20.417
- Yes, now let her
tell the story!

40:20.419 --> 40:22.786
- Okay, sorry, sorry,
I like a full picture!

40:22.788 --> 40:25.455
- So, the movie starts,
cool guys made a bet,

40:25.457 --> 40:27.657
but I'm barely paying
attention because I can't

40:27.659 --> 40:29.058
slow my heart rate.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.960
Guys, why am I telling you
this story?

40:30.962 --> 40:32.796
- Oh, no no no, c'mon,
it's cute.

40:32.798 --> 40:34.330
- Is it?

40:34.332 --> 40:36.366
- Yes, continue.

40:36.368 --> 40:37.667
- Ugh, okay!

40:37.669 --> 40:41.604
So, I notice his hand
moves past the kernels

40:41.606 --> 40:43.773
and I realize he's reaching
for my hand,

40:43.775 --> 40:45.708
so I reach out to meet
him halfway but it's like

40:45.710 --> 40:47.343
I've lost control of my limbs,

40:47.345 --> 40:51.514
and my hand flies towards him
and barrels

40:51.516 --> 40:54.517
into the giant coke
and pours all over him!

40:56.288 --> 40:57.987
Okay, no, I can't do it!

40:57.989 --> 40:59.122
- No, no no, you have to,
come on.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.024
- Sadie, just finish it!

41:01.892 --> 41:05.195
Sam leaps up,
his pants are all wet,

41:05.197 --> 41:08.631
and Brennan grabs some napkins
and starts

41:08.633 --> 41:11.668
mopping 'em up!

41:11.670 --> 41:16.573
And Sam gets
noticeably... excited...

41:16.575 --> 41:17.807
- No, no, he...!

41:17.809 --> 41:19.609
- Yes.

41:20.411 --> 41:22.679
- It was pretty awful.

41:22.681 --> 41:23.713
- Yeah.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.782
- Okay, and then what happened?

41:25.784 --> 41:28.384
- Actually, Sadie had a
severe allergic reaction

41:28.386 --> 41:30.687
to peanuts, so we had
to rush her out of there,

41:30.689 --> 41:31.988
and thankfully a near-death
experience

41:31.990 --> 41:34.757
outshines the awkwardness
at school on Mondays.

41:34.759 --> 41:36.392
- Eventful.

41:36.394 --> 41:40.063
So, um, so, Sadie, do you
have your epi-pen on you?

41:41.232 --> 41:42.499
- Hm?

41:42.501 --> 41:44.067
- You're eating
chocolate-covered peanuts.

41:44.069 --> 41:46.202
- Sadie! Spit it out,
spit 'em out!

41:46.204 --> 41:47.804
Are you okay?

41:48.339 --> 41:49.739
- She's not allergic.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.207
- Okay, Jack, this is serious!

41:51.209 --> 41:52.375
- He's right.

41:54.378 --> 41:55.545
- You faked it?

41:56.747 --> 42:00.583
- You were standing there,
your face was Crustaceous rose.

42:00.585 --> 42:02.819
What was I supposed to do?

42:04.588 --> 42:06.289
- Alright, ladies.

42:06.291 --> 42:09.025
By the looks of the moon,
if I don't head home now,

42:09.027 --> 42:11.461
I will turn into a werewolf.

42:12.229 --> 42:14.397
- Goodnight.
- Night!

42:14.399 --> 42:16.299
- Goodnight, ladies.

42:21.805 --> 42:23.473
- Thanks for saving me.

42:23.475 --> 42:24.941
- It was my pleasure.

42:24.943 --> 42:31.281
Oh, but hiding my nutty legumes
from you for years sucked.

42:31.283 --> 42:33.483
- So, tomorrow?
- Hm?

42:33.485 --> 42:35.485
- Let's do stuff.

42:35.487 --> 42:38.922
We'll do things, or nothing,
I don't know.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.692
- Sounds perfect.

42:45.863 --> 42:46.963
This is cool.

42:49.099 --> 42:50.567
Us like we were.

42:52.036 --> 42:54.404
- Yeah, we're getting there.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.780
I think I'm in the best mood
I've been in

43:03.782 --> 43:07.250
since I learned about
the planet's expiry date.

43:07.252 --> 43:10.853
I leave you with one of my
favorite songs.

43:14.024 --> 43:16.593
- If I were a dude, would I
be like a hot action hero,

43:16.595 --> 43:18.661
or an endearing cute nerd?

43:19.463 --> 43:22.599
- A suave international spy.

43:24.702 --> 43:27.370
- If I were a post-apocalyptic
heroine, which I will be,

43:27.372 --> 43:30.306
would I be more like
tank girl or Katniss Everdeen?

43:30.308 --> 43:32.775
- Linda Hamilton in Terminator.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.777
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

43:34.779 --> 43:38.581
- Guys, I think we have a plan.

43:38.583 --> 43:40.049
- I like planning.

43:40.051 --> 43:42.652
But yours make my stomach bark.

43:42.654 --> 43:45.722
- Teddy's mod night is tonight.

43:45.724 --> 43:48.024
- Not happening.

43:48.026 --> 43:49.892
- It's 21 and over anyway.

43:49.894 --> 43:51.461
- Don't worry about it!

43:51.463 --> 43:52.695
- I'm not!

43:52.697 --> 43:55.264
I'm worried
about everything else.

43:55.266 --> 43:57.634
- Look, I've got it covered,
alright?

43:57.636 --> 43:59.636
I went to the club today,
and I told them

43:59.638 --> 44:01.404
that I drunkenly forgot
my credit card there

44:01.406 --> 44:04.040
the night before.
My dad does it all the time.

44:04.042 --> 44:07.644
They couldn't find it.
I must have been hammered.

44:07.646 --> 44:10.213
You want your exit routes?

44:10.215 --> 44:11.748
You got 'em.

44:11.750 --> 44:15.084
So, the club is located in an
alleyway, with a main entrance

44:15.086 --> 44:17.153
in the front and then
a second in the back.

44:17.155 --> 44:20.757
Once we're in the club, we
have our bathroom to the left,

44:20.759 --> 44:25.261
along with our coveted
emergency exit.

44:25.263 --> 44:26.562
- What was the structure like?

44:26.564 --> 44:28.131
Converted factory space.

44:28.133 --> 44:31.067
- So, wide ceilings,
horizontal supports?

44:31.069 --> 44:32.435
Ain't happening.

44:32.437 --> 44:35.405
- No, no, it was vertical supports
with great thick pillars.

44:40.444 --> 44:43.079
- I'd have to inspect it first.

44:43.081 --> 44:45.181
- So, what would we wear?

44:47.017 --> 44:48.551
- Mod clothes?

44:55.260 --> 44:56.793
- Looks hygienic.

44:57.594 --> 44:58.628
- Looks fun.

44:59.730 --> 45:02.699
- Looks like it could cave in
without an earthquake.

45:03.967 --> 45:05.768
- Sorry, you can't get in.

45:09.773 --> 45:12.675
- Well, you only live once
and stuff.

45:12.677 --> 45:15.178
- Let's do it.
- Really?

45:15.180 --> 45:17.814
- You'll go in?
- Totally!

45:17.816 --> 45:19.348
Act cool.

- Yeah, what I'd do to get in
there...

46:37.128 --> 46:39.562
- Well, then I guess
it's a good thing that I

46:39.564 --> 46:44.534
used the bathroom today and I
taped the backdoor lock open.

46:44.536 --> 46:45.468

46:53.710 --> 46:56.245
- No, it is on the list,
I just, I just, I just,

46:56.247 --> 46:59.415
I think I exaggerated
my determination.

47:00.585 --> 47:01.350

there and there.

47:42.193 --> 47:43.960

47:46.763 --> 47:48.631

48:44.889 --> 48:46.522
Well, I've gotta go
while the needle's hot.

48:46.524 --> 48:48.557
Let me know if you geezers
wanna hear anything.

- So you use that pocket
watch to time travel?

49:47.385 --> 49:51.520
- Not just travel through time,
my dear, but space and time.

49:51.522 --> 49:54.190
Have you ever read
"a wrinkle in time"?

49:54.192 --> 49:55.725
- Yeah.

49:55.727 --> 49:56.926
- Some people think
it's a kid's book,

49:56.928 --> 49:59.762
but it's actually a how-to
guide on time travel.

49:59.764 --> 50:01.097
- How so?

50:01.099 --> 50:02.832
- The Tesseract.

50:02.834 --> 50:05.468
The phenom
of the fifth dimension.

50:05.470 --> 50:11.140
It is like folding the fabric
of space and time,

50:11.142 --> 50:14.010
barreling through the universe,

50:14.012 --> 50:17.646
transporting you
to someplace totally new.

50:24.254 --> 50:25.621
Oh!

50:25.623 --> 50:28.624
- I'm gonna go request a song.

50:28.626 --> 50:30.426
- Have you seen the future?

50:30.428 --> 50:31.660
- Future?

50:31.662 --> 50:34.330
When I go to other planets,
who knows what year it is?

50:34.332 --> 50:35.865
But here on earth, no, never.

50:35.867 --> 50:39.001
- That's because
it's gonna end in six days.

50:39.003 --> 50:40.202
At least, as we know it.

50:40.204 --> 50:41.437
- The 21st.

50:41.439 --> 50:44.640
Could be, if the it wins.

50:44.642 --> 50:45.841
- The it?

50:45.843 --> 50:48.477
- You know, the darkness,
the mind control.

50:48.479 --> 50:51.580
It's trying to win, but the
artists, the philosophers,

50:51.582 --> 50:56.852
the groovy cats like these,
they're trying to fight it.

50:56.854 --> 51:00.022
Everywhere you look, the it
is trying to control your mind,

51:00.024 --> 51:02.725
it's trying to distract
you from what is real,

51:02.727 --> 51:05.294
it's trying to make you
fear the inane.

51:05.296 --> 51:07.229
- Yeah.
- It's everywhere.

51:07.231 --> 51:09.065
You can't sit on the John
without seeing those,

51:09.067 --> 51:12.401
those toilet seat covers
provided for your protection,

51:12.403 --> 51:14.136
by management.

51:14.138 --> 51:15.538
Safety guard.

51:15.540 --> 51:18.808
All I know is I plan
to tesser out with this

51:18.810 --> 51:20.376
for a little bit come Friday.

51:20.378 --> 51:22.211
- Lucky you.
- Mmm.

51:22.213 --> 51:24.680
In the words of Madame lengle,

51:24.682 --> 51:29.085
"love, that is what she had
that the it did not have."

51:29.087 --> 51:30.886
- How did you two get in here?

51:30.888 --> 51:32.455
- Oh! Bye, Burt!

51:33.423 --> 51:35.357
- A straight line is not
the shortest distance

51:35.359 --> 51:37.827
between two points.

51:45.402 --> 51:46.802
- You joshing?

51:46.804 --> 51:50.005
Destiny's child is not
the kind of R&B I play here!

51:52.042 --> 51:55.911
- Getting arrested
was not on my list, Jack!

52:01.852 --> 52:03.085
Brennan!

52:06.957 --> 52:08.457
We shouldn't have
left her there.

52:08.459 --> 52:10.626
- We didn't really
have a choice.

52:10.628 --> 52:12.628
I mean, maybe her and Teddy
hit it off.

52:12.630 --> 52:14.463
I'm sure he'll help her out.

52:14.465 --> 52:17.066
- Teddy is oblivious
to other people,

52:17.068 --> 52:18.734
especially when he's listening
to music!

52:18.736 --> 52:22.571
- Okay, then we'll see
her when she gets out.

52:22.573 --> 52:23.772
Okay, we'll wait here.

52:23.774 --> 52:25.441
Sadie, that was a rush!

52:25.443 --> 52:27.143
Didn't that make you feel free?

52:27.145 --> 52:28.711
- Fearing I may spend
the night in the slammer

52:28.713 --> 52:30.546
does not make me feel very free.

52:30.548 --> 52:35.284
- So, should I call your
parents, or maybe the cops?

52:35.286 --> 52:36.719
They decide.

52:38.555 --> 52:41.257
- I wish I could tesser
through time.

52:41.259 --> 52:45.661
I'd happily take time on
Uriel with the archangels.

52:45.663 --> 52:48.898
- Yeah, that Burt guy
was a trip.

52:48.900 --> 52:51.667
Do you think he was
on something?

52:52.636 --> 52:54.637
- I thought he was interesting.

52:59.277 --> 53:00.809
- Hey, hey, security!

53:00.811 --> 53:02.811
We've got some rockers
ready to brawl at the front!

53:02.813 --> 53:04.513
It's Kobe Bryant all over again!

53:05.448 --> 53:07.616

when he said,

53:20.932 --> 53:22.765
"a straight line is not
the shortest distance

53:22.767 --> 53:24.366
between two points"?

53:27.704 --> 53:34.310
- Maybe when something happens,
or you do something...

53:37.180 --> 53:40.015
it doesn't always

No! No!

55:51.414 --> 55:54.350
- This is why
I should've just let it be.

55:54.352 --> 55:56.652
Feeling like I had lost
Brennan was good prep

55:56.654 --> 55:58.821
for the great loss to come.

55:59.756 --> 56:03.258
Before, I was just
a bad friend who drifted.

56:03.260 --> 56:05.494
Now, I've really hurt her.

56:06.763 --> 56:08.664
The shortest distance
between two points

56:08.666 --> 56:10.833
is not always a straight line.

56:10.835 --> 56:13.702
I had no idea she liked Jack.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.505
I had no idea he liked me.

56:16.507 --> 56:19.141
And until he almost kissed me...

56:19.143 --> 56:21.377
I had no idea I liked him.

56:22.312 --> 56:23.879
But now I don't.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.781
And I hope he doesn't.

56:25.783 --> 56:28.417
- Honey,
there's a Jack here to see you.

56:40.730 --> 56:42.131
- Hey.

56:42.133 --> 56:43.365
- Hi.

56:47.670 --> 56:48.837
- I'm trying to follow
your lead here

56:48.839 --> 56:52.074
of not preparing speeches,
winging it.

56:54.310 --> 56:55.844
Your way sucks.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.379
- Yeah, 'member?

56:57.381 --> 57:00.182
Didn't work so well
for me either.

57:03.052 --> 57:06.789
- Or, grand romantic gesture,
yes!

57:06.791 --> 57:09.158
Um, mental rewind.

57:27.610 --> 57:33.115
- Oh sweet angel, a cherub
who will deliver us all

57:33.117 --> 57:36.218
at the hour of the great demise!

57:36.220 --> 57:39.688
And continue on the fight
after the rapture!

57:39.690 --> 57:44.092
Oh, angel of death,
send me high!

57:44.094 --> 57:45.761
- Angel of death?!

57:47.864 --> 57:51.533
- No, no, it's a good thing.
- Like Sunday school?

57:51.535 --> 57:52.768
Saint Michael brought
a whole bunch of people

57:52.770 --> 57:55.237
up to heaven after the rapture.

57:56.372 --> 58:00.142
- So, I'm gonna kill everyone
and I'm a dude?

58:00.144 --> 58:03.412
- How did religious metaphor
work so well for Romeo?

58:03.414 --> 58:07.115
- He did have Shakespeare
workin' for him.

58:07.117 --> 58:11.353
- Well, I mean, I didn't have
a lot of time to prepare.

58:19.929 --> 58:23.198
Neither of us knew, Sadie.

58:26.436 --> 58:27.936
It's not our fault.

58:28.605 --> 58:31.006
- There's no more time.

58:31.008 --> 58:34.176
Brennan made me realize
this makes no sense.

58:34.178 --> 58:36.778
I can't open up to somebody
who I'm just gonna lose

58:36.780 --> 58:38.380
in a few days.

58:40.683 --> 58:42.317
I'm no good for you.

58:48.825 --> 58:50.726
- But I climbed a tree!

58:58.502 --> 59:02.170
So this is what
teenage angst feels like.

59:10.980 --> 59:12.347
- Brennan!

59:13.483 --> 59:15.183
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

59:15.185 --> 59:16.451
- Of course you didn't.

59:16.453 --> 59:17.819
You don't blab to everyone
around school

59:17.821 --> 59:19.888
about the boy you like
because you look pretty stupid

59:19.890 --> 59:22.925
if he finds out and he
doesn't like you back.

59:25.828 --> 59:28.397
- Well, why didn't you tell me?

59:35.171 --> 59:36.872
- Sadie, fourth grade,
miss grange's class,

59:36.874 --> 59:37.839
who was my crush?

59:37.841 --> 59:39.074
- Matt Dylan, no relation?

59:39.076 --> 59:41.310
- Our first summer at camp
Wonagan, who did we stalk?

59:41.312 --> 59:43.245
- Christopher creepy-hands,
which I never understood, but...

59:43.247 --> 59:46.248
- you knew those things because
you were my best friend.

59:46.250 --> 59:48.650
You lost those privileges.

59:48.652 --> 59:49.952
See ya.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:13.609
- No, look, I am here in
the old part of school

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:15.277
for you!

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:20.115
- No, Sadie, it's about you.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.652
This is about jumping
into your delusional void.

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:26.788
You need to figure out
you before there's an us.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.023
None of this is about me.

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:30.325
- Yes, it is.

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:33.261
Brennan, I am trying!

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:35.097
I just wanna make things right
before Th...

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:36.732
- ugh, before!

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.834
I don't wanna hear "before"
or "when"!

01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:41.703
The world isn't gonna end,
Sadie!

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:43.739
You need to free yourself
because break

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:47.376
will come and go and we'll
all be back at school.

01:00:47.378 --> 01:00:50.412
This hallway
you're so afraid of,

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:52.547
it's just a bunch of walls
you built

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:54.716
because you're too
afraid to live your life.

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:56.752
- You're wrong.

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:58.120
- Fine.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:00:59.888
The world is gonna end.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.790
Super volcanoes fill
the atmosphere with ash

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:04.493
while tsunamis cover the earth
in water.

01:01:04.495 --> 01:01:06.094
You're gonna make it
through that?

01:01:06.096 --> 01:01:08.664
You and your little bunker box?

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:11.133
- I am prepared.

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:13.235
- But why, Sadie?

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:15.837
Why won't you live your
life while you have one?

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.740
What would be left that's
worth being there for?

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:33.055
- Please work or read quietly.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.802
- You don't have detention.

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.538
- Chartreuse.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.643
Principal said
if I painted my locker

01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:57.546
one more shade of green,
he'd suspend me.

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:02.651
C'mon, Sadie.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.088
Talk to me.

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:09.825
I like you...

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:14.830
and I'm pretty sure
that you like me.

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:19.868
And look, I get it,
chicks before dicks,

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.737
and I feel bad
about Brennan too,

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:26.074
but she'll get over this
before you know it, okay?

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.710
That's, that's how
these things work.

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.813
She's gonna walk down
the hall and see someone

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:34.116
she's seen a million times.

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:38.854
And one day, she'll just
see them differently.

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.889
Know they're a match.

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:43.792
Like I did.

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:52.868
- Even if there was time,
I couldn't do that to her.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:57.205
- Sadie, but that is what's
so great about being with you!

01:02:57.207 --> 01:02:59.441
There is no time!

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:04.246
I get to live my life like
the world is gonna end.

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:05.514
I'm not worried
about this detention

01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:07.482
being on my transcript.

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:11.787
Do you know that last
week was the first time

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:14.289
that I didn't lie awake in bed
thinking of all the ways

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.459
I could have hurt
my college chances?

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:22.964
Instead, I drifted off
thinking about you.

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:29.905
Look, Sadie, maybe it has
nothing to do

01:03:29.907 --> 01:03:32.140
with the end of the world.

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:38.180
Maybe you can't open up
to someone...

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:43.752
well, because you can't
open up to yourself.

01:03:43.754 --> 01:03:46.454
- I'm, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:50.425
- Where do you think
you're going?

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:53.595
Go.

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:03.205
- Sadie, Sadie!

01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:16.651
- Love.

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:22.023
That was what she had
that it did not have.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.794
No thanks.

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:28.830
It's better if I just stay away.

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:30.398
I'm only causing pain.

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:35.570
If this is it for them, they
should enjoy their last Moments

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:38.039
without me screwing things up.

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:02.664
- FG is a force of attraction,

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:05.934
and g is the constant
gravitational pull.

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:15.810
The acceleration
between two objects

01:05:15.812 --> 01:05:18.747
is shown by at and a2.

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:26.521
- Everyone under your desks!

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:03.892
- Is everyone okay?

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:12.100
- The big one's coming!

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:26.081
- This is it.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.084
A preview.

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:33.455
A precursor to something
much bigger.

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:37.125
Time to double-check
the inventory.

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:52.307
- You're out of
water-purifying tablets?!

01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:53.842
- Yeah, look, we're out
of a lot of things, all right?

01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:55.510
- But I need some!

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:58.246
- Sadie, you keep a
larger stock than I do.

01:06:58.248 --> 01:06:59.748
You'll be fine.

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.149
- You have iodine pills?

01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:03.618
I'll give you 50 for a bottle.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.353
A hundred!

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.591
- 80 bucks.

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:10.759
- What?!

01:07:10.761 --> 01:07:12.794
- 80 bucks.

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:29.010
Forget the list.

01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:31.079
Time to say my goodbyes.

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:45.693
Only minor injuries

01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:49.164
were sustained during
yesterday's 7.6,

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:51.866
but some experts worry
this quake may just be

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:55.770
a foreshock of something
much bigger to come.

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:58.073
There is still an Amber alert
on the red Toyota pick-up...

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.340
- Morning, sweetie.

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.009
Last seen at crimson...

01:08:01.011 --> 01:08:02.510
- Have a good day, honey.

01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:04.045
- Wait.

01:08:04.047 --> 01:08:09.284
You guys can... should stay
in the bunker tonight.

01:08:09.286 --> 01:08:11.753
- Why would we do that?

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:15.256
- Aw, my, my. Come on, honey.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.759
Come on,
I thought this was done with.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:20.060
You've come so far!

01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:21.796
This will be all over tomorrow.

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:23.163
- Roger.

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:26.367
- There was a massive earthquake
yesterday.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.004
But I'm sure
we'll be fine sleeping

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:31.272
in our own beds tonight,
sweetheart...

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.506
- but you...

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:36.344
- but if anything should happen
when the clock strikes 12,

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:40.180
we will be in that bunker
faster than you can say...

01:08:40.183 --> 01:08:41.950
- Apocalypse.

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:45.886
- Come here.

01:08:45.889 --> 01:08:48.523
- No one can say
you're not committed.

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:53.862
- I love you.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.596
- We love you, too.

01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:16.651
- I just wanted to say thank you

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:20.321
for... distracting me.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:24.259
- It is one of
my finer qualities.

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.962
Sadie, tomorrow's
forecast of doom

01:09:27.964 --> 01:09:30.131
has me noodle stewing.

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.899
Maybe you're right.

01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:33.801
- I have been telling you...

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:34.769
- no!

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.671
About how records aren't mates.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:38.473
I mean, they are, but they
shouldn't be

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:40.241
my only friends.

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:41.676
I think I started running
in the hallways

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:43.478
with you 'cause I thought
this old fish

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.813
would swim backwards upstream.

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.081
No offense.

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:48.515
- Eh.

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:51.819
- I figured with all
your nutter ideas,

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:53.354
you couldn't possibly
cast me off

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:54.789
as a radio rental.

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.659
Mental.

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:02.497
But I learned you're smashing.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.035
Anyway, maybe I've got
this front

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:09.904
because I'm afraid people
won't accept me.

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:13.875
- Hm, that's very mature...

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:18.446
or wise of you, I think, Teddy.

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:19.681
But you're you.

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:21.950
A really great you.

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:24.719
And that's no front.

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:30.391
- I'm not British.

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.397
- Well, I figured I could be
someone new in high school,

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:40.668
and if people can pick their
clothes, why not their accents?

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:45.340
- That's... fair, I guess.

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:47.542
- You know, if I didn't
say that out loud,

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:48.843
I would've just buried it
back down

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:51.312
once tomorrow comes and goes.

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:53.114
Whichever way it goes.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.884
Thanks.

01:10:56.886 --> 01:10:58.419
- I'm glad I could help, Teddy.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.021
- I'm throwing a party tonight,
and it's for people

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:01.889
I actually go to school with.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:06.694
- "One last bash
before the big smash."

01:11:08.265 --> 01:11:10.898
Better hurry,
or we're gonna be late.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.167
- One last history class, huh?

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:15.970
I can groove with that.

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:22.944
Did somebody die?

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:25.513
- No, no one died.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.049
"The end is near."

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:31.552
So now they believe.

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:36.691
Crap, bye Teddy!

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:44.392
Hi.

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:50.431
I know you don't wanna
talk to me, but I...

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:55.636
- there was an earthquake
yesterday.

01:12:55.638 --> 01:12:56.971
I know.

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.674
You told me so.

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:04.312
- No, I just...
- I wanted to say goodbye.

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:08.549
- Bye.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.057
- Bye.

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:25.700
- There she is.

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:27.568
- You know what to do, right?

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:28.803
- What are you guys
talking about?

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:30.405
- Can we stop it?

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:31.506
- The apocalypse.

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:33.040
Aren't you the expert?

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:37.378
- Umm, I dunno, I mean,
I know some.

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.013
- So what can we do?

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.650
- Nothing now!

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.822
You might just wanna
say your goodbyes.

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:50.358
- What?
- Goodbyes?

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.592
- Look, you have supplies.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.528
Can, can we have some?

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.830
- I only have enough
for myself and...

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:59.233
I have to go.

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:03.204
Sorry I couldn't do more
to help.

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:07.608
Hide under a strong table
or door frame.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.011
Fill all your jugs with water.

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:13.915
Goodbye!

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.593
- Goodbye.

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.163
- Goodbye.

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:46.848
- Sadie,

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:49.650
I can't tell you how much
you meant to me.

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.452
I built my whole life
around Calvin,

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:54.956
and I forgot to keep any
friends in the process.

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:59.660
But then I met you on the
bleachers, and I made a new one.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:02.597
You're smart, funny,
and so damn strong

01:15:02.599 --> 01:15:04.465
I wanna punch your xiphoid.

01:15:04.467 --> 01:15:06.467
There's your last
anatomy lesson.

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:08.936
I want you to use
that foresight of yours

01:15:08.938 --> 01:15:11.439
and not make the same mistakes
I did.

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:15.243
Your fight for survival
has made me realize

01:15:15.245 --> 01:15:18.579
maybe I don't have to fear
being alone at the end.

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:20.781
It's time to enter the void.

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.651
I don't know
what will happen tomorrow,

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:26.420
but at least I won't be here.

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:29.090
Goodbye, Sadie.

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:30.625
Always,

01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:32.093
Connie.

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:35.997
- Dad, I need you to drive me!

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:37.431
Dad, go faster!

01:15:38.902 --> 01:15:41.168
The white one! The grey...
white... right, right, right!

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:01.989
- Sadie!

01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:10.998
- Sadie! What the fuck?!

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.433
- You can't kill yourself!

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:16.170
- You'll meet other guys,
you can't just hide away

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:19.140
and plan your own pity party,
Connie!

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:24.045
You are hilarious and brassy
in the best of ways!

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:26.814
It's not your choice
to leave the world behind,

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:29.750
and removing yourself
from it like that is, is

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:32.820
the most selfish thing you could
do!

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:35.323
- Sadie, what are you
talking about?

01:16:35.325 --> 01:16:37.758
- You left me a suicide letter!

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.627
If I hadn't gotten here
on time and you did it,

01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:43.965
just think of the long-term
damage I could've sustained!

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:46.033
Wait, have you already done it?

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.702
Connie, spit them out!

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:49.670
- Sadie, Sadie.

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:51.639
Okay.

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:55.509
I left you that letter
because I didn't

01:16:55.511 --> 01:16:57.545
see you at school today.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:02.717
- But you said, "I won't be
here."

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:05.820
- I won't be here!

01:17:05.822 --> 01:17:07.655
Yesterday's quake
got me thinking.

01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:08.589
If it is the end tomorrow,

01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:10.992
I don't wanna be
lying in bed wallowing.

01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:12.526
I'm gonna be sitting on a beach
in Cabo,

01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:14.862
enjoying my vacation
without Calvin.

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:18.699
That letter was a
"just in case" goodbye.

01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:20.067
- Oh.

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:21.836
Wait, the pills!

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:24.171
- Have you ever tried to
find Motrin PMS in Mexico?

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:29.644
Sadie, did you hear anything
you just said to me?

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:31.479
- Excuse me?

01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:33.381
- I meant what I wrote.

01:17:33.383 --> 01:17:35.249
You are so strong.

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:37.785
But don't be stubborn.

01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:40.788
There is a big what-if
hanging in the air,

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:42.857
and if it is your last night,
then,

01:17:42.859 --> 01:17:45.159
then go out there and have fun.

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:47.695
- I can't.

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:51.766
- Yes, you can.

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.435
Life can always end.

01:17:54.437 --> 01:17:56.804
That's the point of living.

01:17:56.806 --> 01:17:58.973
So take the risk
and live your life.

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:02.877
High school's gonna throw
so much crap at you.

01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:05.446
It's gonna get better and
worse in different ways.

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:07.648
Meet it head-on.

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:09.150
- But I'm crummy!

01:18:09.152 --> 01:18:11.652
- Are you kidding me?

01:18:11.654 --> 01:18:13.621
You have a boy who's
head-over-heels for you.

01:18:13.623 --> 01:18:15.356
You show Brennan
that there's more to life

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:17.625
than the reach-over
social media brand.

01:18:17.627 --> 01:18:20.528
Then the Teddy kid, he's there.

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.197
You affect people.

01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:27.301
- I guess I do.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:29.437
- So let them affect you.

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:32.306
The world can wait a few hours.

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:34.675
- You're right.

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:37.411
- Now, quick.

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:39.146
Demure blue or trampy red?

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:41.816
What's the saying?
Sluts have more fun?

01:18:41.818 --> 01:18:44.719
- Mm, not sure
I've heard that one.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.658
Have a great trip, Connie.

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:56.230
But when that wave comes, it's
easier if you don't fight it.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.933
- Morbid, Sadie, morbid.

01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:00.201
Come here.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.520
- Oh, also!

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:21.455
I broke a window!

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:23.023
Sorry, bye!

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:25.092
- So charming, okay.

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:29.096
Alright.

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:33.601
- Sadie.

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:36.470
- Right, you're here.

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:38.005
- Everything okay?

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:40.741
- Yeah.

01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:43.611
Actually, things are
pretty great, dad.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:47.548
- So, you want a ride home?

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:53.187
- Mm... sure.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.733
Love you dad, thanks!

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:54.742

01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:07.855
we have pin the tail
on the Mayan calendar!

01:22:07.857 --> 01:22:09.156
- How does it work?

01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:11.859
- You pin the tail
on December 21st.

01:22:11.861 --> 01:22:14.628
- Shouldn't people
be blindfolded?

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:16.730
- No one actually knows
how to read it, so...

01:22:16.732 --> 01:22:17.965
Everyone drinks!

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:22.803
- Yay!

01:22:22.805 --> 01:22:25.339
You've really outdone yourself.

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:28.008
Is there a back door?

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:30.744
- Exit strategies,
right, of course!

01:22:30.746 --> 01:22:32.746

01:22:32.748 --> 01:22:36.350
And, Sadie,
you look totally dishy.

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:39.920
Hot!

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:50.531
Now, who's ready for the end
of the world?

01:22:52.001 --> 01:22:53.634
Don't touch that.

01:23:19.461 --> 01:23:21.128
- No, not yet!

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:33.273
- Emoticons were,
like, analog emojis.

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:35.776
Also, I'm, like,
really intimidated by...

01:23:35.778 --> 01:23:37.144
- Sadie.

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:43.517
Why are you on the ground?

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:44.952
- I took a dive.

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:54.161
- I'm so sorry
I stepped on your foot.

01:23:54.163 --> 01:23:55.763
- Please.

01:23:55.765 --> 01:23:56.964
- I am.

01:23:56.966 --> 01:24:00.267
- No, I mean you have
nothing to be sorry about.

01:24:00.269 --> 01:24:02.703
- Oh, big picture.

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:07.975
- Brennan, I didn't intend
on becoming this way.

01:24:07.977 --> 01:24:09.777
It just sorta happened
gradually over the course

01:24:09.779 --> 01:24:12.346
of that natural disaster
project.

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:15.516
You have always been
so adventurous,

01:24:15.518 --> 01:24:19.119
and you were so patient
as I tested the waters.

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:22.122
- Felt like I was rising
to the occasion.

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:26.593
- But one day, I looked up
and I couldn't hang out

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:30.631
at the mall under
a glass ceiling anymore, and...

01:24:30.633 --> 01:24:32.699
I felt like you ditched me.

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:37.237
And now I realize
that I ran away from you.

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:42.142
You know I would never
intentionally hurt you.

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:49.650
- Sade.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:52.419
I love who you are.

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:58.292
I was never angry that
you became this way.

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:03.730
I was angry that you
didn't let me in.

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.201
- I'm sorry.

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:12.239
- We're all afraid.
- I'm scared my tits are falling

01:25:12.241 --> 01:25:14.575
and you're worried the sky is.

01:25:14.577 --> 01:25:15.976
Tomatoes, to-mah-toes.

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:27.087
And I'm over Jack.

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:29.423
I met a new guy.

01:25:29.425 --> 01:25:31.658
And I already kissed him.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.327
I think you know him?

01:25:33.329 --> 01:25:34.761
- Who?!

01:25:34.763 --> 01:25:37.664
- Teddy!

01:25:37.666 --> 01:25:39.733
- No way!

01:25:39.735 --> 01:25:41.869
That's amazing!

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.371
And weird.

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:45.639
- I know.

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:48.408
Did you know
he's not actually British?

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:51.712
He's so culturally fluid.

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:55.682
I was hoping you'd come tonight.

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:58.986
I really wanted
to tell my best friend.

01:26:04.959 --> 01:26:07.694
- So, do you wanna sleep
over at my place tonight?

01:26:07.696 --> 01:26:09.429
I got a cot with
your name on it.

01:26:09.431 --> 01:26:10.731
- Then I'm in, cap'n.

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:13.000
We'll brave a new world
together.

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:16.737
But seriously, Jack.

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:19.740
Go get him.

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:24.745
- You don't think
I blew it already?

01:26:24.747 --> 01:26:27.548
- I think he'd wait outside
your house in an earthquake.

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:29.049
Go!

01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:33.587
11:54.

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:37.791

01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:44.798
- No, but you wanna try
the beer-cano?

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.300
- Not really.

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.842
Jack Diaz, you seen him?

01:26:55.844 --> 01:26:57.778
- Uh, I think he's
in the sun room.

01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.012
- Thanks.

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:01.915
