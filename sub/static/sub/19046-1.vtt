[ Dennis ]
Mac, you gotta see
this movie, dude.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.437
[ Dee ]
Really? I thought
it was boring.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.206
Boring? It's about
the end of the world, Dee.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.540
Inconvenient Truth
is not about the end
of the world.

00:08.542 --> 00:12.378
It is about how if we don't stop
global warming, we are going
to destroy this environment.

00:12.380 --> 00:16.348
I think it sounds cool.
I'll check it out.
It is. It's awesome.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.051
Dude, come on.
What the hell is that?

00:19.053 --> 00:21.186
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

00:21.188 --> 00:24.590
What is the big deal, Dennis?
What is the big deal?
Are you nuts?

00:24.592 --> 00:26.759
It's like you see a movie,
and now you're crazy
about the environment.

00:26.761 --> 00:32.231
Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe I would
actually like to do some good in
this world, make a difference.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.166
You wanna do good?
Yes.
You can't do good.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.401
You're not good at that.
I can do good.
No.

00:35.403 --> 00:39.304
- I am capable of doing good.
- No, you just screw people over
for your own benefit.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.607
You guys are gonna be so angry
when you look back
and you see...

00:41.609 --> 00:46.345
that the world looks
at Dennis Reynolds and says,
"Dennis, you are a good person.

00:46.347 --> 00:49.114
You are making a di"--

00:49.549 --> 00:52.317
- Holy shit.
- What?

00:52.319 --> 00:55.788
There's a baby
in this Dumpster.

01:28.655 --> 01:33.325
- [ Raspberries ]
- [ Mac ]
What the hell is it doing?

01:33.327 --> 01:35.661
We gotta call somebody.
Who?

01:35.663 --> 01:37.262
The police? The mother?
I mean, think, Dee.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.766
Somebody threw this baby
in the trash. We can't just
put it back into the system.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.434
It is a terrible system.
It's a horrible system.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.671
We live in a throwaway culture
where everyone's just lookin'
for the easy way out.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.307
You don't wanna carry
your Big Gulp anymore?
Throw it in the street.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.476
Don't wanna take care
of your baby?
Throw it in a Dumpster.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.278
- [ Giggling ]
- I just can't take it.
Charlie, you're harpin' on it.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.915
Well, I'm sorry.
I'd like to know whether or not
I share a bed with my father.

01:56.917 --> 02:00.886
I'm tellin' you,
I am not your father.
Then take a stupid blood test.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.421
I'm not takin'
no blood test.
It's so easy.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.624
It's a little prick--
Look, I've had enough of this.
I'm not even gonna talk--

02:05.626 --> 02:10.729
- What the hell is that?
- It's a baby
we found in the trash.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.898
Well, put it back.
It doesn't belong to you.

02:12.900 --> 02:13.832
We're not gonna
put it back.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.401
Well, give it to the cops.
Get it outta here.
It's bad for business.

02:16.403 --> 02:19.838
Oh, that's great, Frank.
Pass the buck. Just passin'--
Everybody passin' the buck.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.342
You know, it's time we started
taking responsibility
for the refuse we're creating.

02:23.344 --> 02:27.946
Oh, my God, dude. Are you
still harpin' on that stupid
global heating movie you saw?

02:27.948 --> 02:31.517
"Global warming,"
Charlie.
Yeah. Right.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.852
Like the earth
is magically
getting hotter.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.655
All right, stop!
Clearly this is not the right
environment for a child.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.526
I will take care of the Dumpster
baby until we figure out
what to do with it.

02:40.528 --> 02:43.362
Dee, you're helping me.
What? No, I'm not.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.397
You see what's happening here?
Do you see this?

02:45.399 --> 02:49.334
Family values in this country
are going down the toilet, and
it's because of people like you.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.372
Men and women raising a child
together is a proven system
a thousand years old.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.908
There are parental roles that
need to be filled here, right?

02:55.910 --> 02:58.510
Otherwise,
the kid winds up
roaming the streets,

02:58.512 --> 03:00.846
having unprotected sex
with multiple partners--
[ Groans ] Mm-hmm.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.349
sharing needles and
contracting the H.I.V. virus,
and it's all your fault.

03:04.351 --> 03:10.856
Are you happy, Dee? Is this
what you wanted? You just gave
this baby full-blown AIDS.

03:17.897 --> 03:20.966
What the hell
are these scrubs doing, dude?
They're activists, Charlie.

03:20.968 --> 03:24.937
They're sifting
through the trash looking
for recyclable materials.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.672
Recycling.
What a waste.

03:26.674 --> 03:31.643
Frank, we are trying
to make a difference.

03:31.778 --> 03:35.914
You see? He has no problem
not callin' me "Dad."

03:36.249 --> 03:39.284
Uh, hey, man. Where can I get
one of those recycle bags?

03:39.286 --> 03:42.821
Get lost, narc.
Excuse me?

03:42.989 --> 03:46.658
What we're doing is
completely legal, so why don't
you just leave us alone?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.994
Oh. No, I'm not a cop, man.
I just wanna help out.

03:48.996 --> 03:52.397
[ Chuckles ] Sure you do.
I saw you pull up
in that Range Rover.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.433
Is everything okay, Sage?
Yeah. No, everything's fine.

03:54.435 --> 03:58.770

to your friend that I--
I want to help you guys out.

with your moussed-up,

04:06.814 --> 04:08.914
This isn't just
a hobby for us.

04:08.916 --> 04:13.752
So why don't you take
your phony, suburban,
half-assed bullshit...

04:13.754 --> 04:16.255

04:21.361 --> 04:23.829
I'll take that, hippie.

04:23.831 --> 04:27.899

04:41.782 --> 04:45.450
Dude, it's amazing!
Look at this. Bro, you can chop
a camel right in the hump...

04:45.452 --> 04:47.653
and drink all its milk
right off the tip
of this thing, man.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.956
That is a find, man!
That's spectacular.
This is an Ali Baba sword, dude.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.792
Come on, you guys.
Let's get out of here.
Look, Dennis. Look at this.

04:53.794 --> 04:57.062
I don't care about that,
all right? You guys are
makin' me look like an asshole.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.665
I'm out here tryin'
to make a difference,
and you're over here...

04:59.667 --> 05:01.066

like a couple of narcs, okay?

05:01.068 --> 05:07.072
You can't just come down here
with your mainline, cashmere,

05:07.074 --> 05:09.675
and start bein'
like a suburban tool.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.343

You can't--

05:11.345 --> 05:14.379
Are you feeling all right?
What are you saying?
Did you even look at this?

05:14.381 --> 05:18.950
I don't know.
I think I just got punked out
by a couple of hippies.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.520
I gotta do somethin'
about this.

[ Door Closes ]

05:22.189 --> 05:25.424
Goddamn,
this Dumpster baby's heavy.
No, no, it's good for your back.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.660
All right.
So we got the diapers
and the wipes and the powder.

Shit, this raisin' babies
is easy, huh?
Huh?

05:30.698 --> 05:34.666

gonna kick back, grab a beer

to do this with you.

- Hey, if we're gonna raise
this baby together,

05:57.424 --> 05:59.658

we at least try
to make it work, so...

when you're done with the bath,
why don't you go out
and get some beer,

06:02.996 --> 06:04.830
and, um, a pack of smokes
would be good.

06:04.832 --> 06:08.867

For the sake of the baby,

I gotta find
that Ali Baba sword.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.418
Pour me a shot there, Dee.
I am the man.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.688
Why are you so chipper?
Well, I got punked out
by this peace activist.

20:57.690 --> 21:01.826
So what I did is, I infiltrated
his organization, I banged
his girlfriend, and then I--

21:01.828 --> 21:05.763
- Hey, Frank! You recognize
this young man right here?
- Interrupt me. All right.

21:05.765 --> 21:10.701
Or should I say, "Hey, Dad"?
Yeah. That's right, everybody.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.637
Who would like to hear
a mind-blowing story?

21:12.639 --> 21:16.374
Nobody. Give us back our baby
so we can paint it.
Oh, you're gonna paint it, huh?

21:16.376 --> 21:19.610
Well, be careful painting it,
'cause you'll be painting
my brother.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.812
But I guess
you already knew that,
didn't you, Dad?

21:21.814 --> 21:23.581
What the hell
are you talkin' about,
Charlie?

21:23.583 --> 21:26.584
I'm talkin' about you
and the waitress dumpin'
your baby in a Dumpster!

21:26.586 --> 21:30.421
And the abortion that you
tried to make my mom have?
Well, guess what, Frankie.

21:30.423 --> 21:35.293
It didn't take.
I'm an abortion survivor, Dad!
I survived the abortion, Dad!

21:35.295 --> 21:39.497
Charlie! First of all,
it takes nine months
to have a baby.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.765
That is not my baby.

21:40.767 --> 21:45.369
Second of all, your mother
is feedin' you a line of crap!

21:45.371 --> 21:47.605
Holy shit. You guys
kept the Ali Baba sword?

21:47.607 --> 21:50.541
Gimme the sword!
That's the sword I want.
Back off, man.
