WEBVTT

00:22.379 --> 00:23.999
- Okaaaay, what is goin' on?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.413
Why is everyone upset?

00:26.551 --> 00:27.792
Did Coach Dangle

00:27.793 --> 00:29.172
wear his short shorts
again today?

00:33.068 --> 00:34.274
- Kenzie, you tell her.

00:34.275 --> 00:35.550
- Yeah, she needs to know.

00:35.551 --> 00:36.688
- Why?

00:36.689 --> 00:39.517
My parents never told me
when my turtle died.

00:40.724 --> 00:42.861
They just said he was resting...

00:42.862 --> 00:44.344
and decomposing.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.757
- All right...

00:47.758 --> 00:48.895
Somebody tell me what's going on

00:48.896 --> 00:51.585
or I bust this boy's finger.

00:51.586 --> 00:52.757
- She'll do it!

00:52.758 --> 00:53.792
She's crazy!

00:53.793 --> 00:55.310
- Okay...

00:56.758 --> 01:00.930
Y'know, life's weird, isn't it?

01:00.931 --> 01:02.516
Like...

01:02.517 --> 01:06.688
one minute everything's
all peanuts and sweet custard,

01:06.689 --> 01:08.171
then the next thing ya know,

01:08.172 --> 01:09.930
your dad's out of work

01:09.931 --> 01:12.103
and your turtle's decomposing.

01:13.172 --> 01:14.481
- Owwww... help!

01:14.482 --> 01:15.482
Please tell her!

01:15.483 --> 01:17.412
- All right!

01:17.413 --> 01:20.654
Mason Kendal
is moving to Florida.

01:20.655 --> 01:21.793
- Ha...

01:25.793 --> 01:28.343
You're a liar.

01:28.344 --> 01:29.550
- Babe...
- She lies!

01:29.551 --> 01:32.827
Why do you lie
like a lying liar?!?

01:36.758 --> 01:39.826
- I'm so sorry, sweetie.

01:39.827 --> 01:41.654
- Uh... I just want
to let you know,

01:41.655 --> 01:44.620
my finger had nothing
to do with this.

01:48.724 --> 01:50.516
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

01:50.517 --> 01:53.171
I mean, sure...

01:53.172 --> 01:56.136
I'm bummed that...

01:56.137 --> 01:59.826
that Mason Kendal
is moving away...

01:59.827 --> 02:02.930
far from me... but hey...

02:02.931 --> 02:05.378
I'm gonna go to my locker...

02:05.379 --> 02:06.758
and get my jacket...

02:13.931 --> 02:16.620
- Looks like she's
gonna be oh-kay.

02:28.517 --> 02:29.482
- Babe...

02:29.483 --> 02:31.619
come help me
test this new level.

02:31.620 --> 02:33.137
- Comin'...

02:35.896 --> 02:37.412
- Okay, I'll do the ski jump,

02:37.413 --> 02:40.033
and you can watch the virtual
experience on my monitor

02:40.034 --> 02:42.723
and that way you'll see
what I'm seeing.

02:42.724 --> 02:44.862
- Wow, a monitor, so cool.

02:50.275 --> 02:53.102
- Whoooaaaaaaa!

02:53.103 --> 02:56.792
'Kay, here goes me!

02:56.793 --> 02:58.240
Woooooooo!

02:58.241 --> 03:00.136
Ho yeah baby!
This is amazing.

03:00.137 --> 03:02.033
Ha... ho ha ahhhh!

03:02.034 --> 03:03.379
TREE!

03:05.310 --> 03:07.344
- Trees are great.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.447
- Ulch... hey!

03:12.448 --> 03:14.205
I'm working my aspirin off here,

03:14.206 --> 03:15.585
coding this game,

03:15.586 --> 03:17.826
and you're not even
paying attention.

03:17.827 --> 03:20.896
- Thanks, just order me
a Cobb salad.

03:23.862 --> 03:25.757
What... dude!

03:25.758 --> 03:27.205
- Florida?

03:27.206 --> 03:28.654
Okay, why are you looking

03:28.655 --> 03:30.655
for apartments
for rent in Flor...

03:32.172 --> 03:34.205
Ohhhh Babe.

03:34.206 --> 03:38.516
- I've always loved Florida!

03:38.517 --> 03:41.171
- What you "love"
is Mason Kendal.

03:41.172 --> 03:43.205
- Soo? If I could stop
loving Mason Kendal

03:43.206 --> 03:44.896
don't you think I would?!?

03:46.793 --> 03:49.516
- This is just sad.

03:49.517 --> 03:51.309
- You wanna know
what I did last night?

03:51.310 --> 03:52.862
- I don't think I do.

03:54.931 --> 03:56.551
- I made this.

03:58.827 --> 04:02.517
- Yeah. This is
my virtual reality.

04:04.965 --> 04:07.171
- Hey... y'know what?

04:07.172 --> 04:09.586
- No, I don't know
anything anymore.

04:11.586 --> 04:13.723
- What if I told you
that there's a way

04:13.724 --> 04:15.274
for you to be with Mason Kendal

04:15.275 --> 04:17.205
whenever you want,
as much as you want?

04:17.206 --> 04:19.171
- What, you mean like kidnap him

04:19.172 --> 04:21.757
and then take him
to a cabin in the woods?

04:21.758 --> 04:23.205
- Seriously?

04:23.206 --> 04:25.688
- Nooo.

04:25.689 --> 04:28.240
But if I was serious,
would you help me do it?

04:28.241 --> 04:30.033
- Do you wanna hear
my idea or not?

04:30.034 --> 04:31.102
- Yeah, what, tell me.

04:31.103 --> 04:32.654
- Okay...

04:32.655 --> 04:35.136
Since we have
all this cool stuff

04:35.137 --> 04:38.481
to make virtual reality games,

04:38.482 --> 04:40.861
we could use it to create
Virtual Mason Kendal.

04:40.862 --> 04:42.378
- Nah. You talkin' crazy.

04:42.379 --> 04:44.136
- Think about it.

04:44.137 --> 04:45.688
If we get Mason to come here,

04:45.689 --> 04:47.481
and I can get him on video...

04:47.482 --> 04:49.481
- Then we could use the video

04:49.482 --> 04:52.274
to create my very own
Mason Kendal Experience.

04:52.275 --> 04:53.723
- Yeeeaaahhh.
- Nooooooooo.

04:53.724 --> 04:54.999
- Why?
- 'Cuz!

04:55.000 --> 04:56.585
If we ask Mason to do that

04:56.586 --> 04:58.447
then he's gonna think my
obsession with him is creepy.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.930
- It's way creepy.

05:00.931 --> 05:02.723
- I know, but he doesn't
need to think that.

05:02.724 --> 05:04.274
- Look, we'll just tell him

05:04.275 --> 05:06.033
that we're making a game
about ski jumping,

05:06.034 --> 05:07.412
which is true,

05:07.413 --> 05:09.205
and we'll ask him to be in it.

05:09.206 --> 05:10.999
- Okay...

05:11.000 --> 05:13.447
Okay, that could work.

05:13.448 --> 05:15.895
- Aww... Toot toot!

05:15.896 --> 05:17.033
- Heyyyyyy...

05:17.034 --> 05:18.379
- Beep beep!

05:19.896 --> 05:20.758
- That's right!

05:20.759 --> 05:22.550
I got a falcon on my shoulder!

05:24.068 --> 05:27.481
- Are you sure it's even
legal to have a falc...

05:27.482 --> 05:29.964
Ow!

05:29.965 --> 05:32.895
- Sorry, I hit that
sound-effect by mistake.

05:32.896 --> 05:34.378
- Baaaahhhh!!!

05:37.448 --> 05:39.343
- Awww... Baaaa!

05:39.344 --> 05:40.723
Look at what your
facacta sound effect

05:40.724 --> 05:42.862
made the bird do on my jacket!

05:44.206 --> 05:46.379
Nope! Uh-uh...

05:49.103 --> 05:50.585
- For real?!?
- What?

05:50.586 --> 05:52.826
- Why'd you throw
that jacket away?

05:52.827 --> 05:55.758
- 'Cuz I'm not gonna
wear a bird toilet.

05:58.344 --> 05:59.481
- Well, then can I have it?

05:59.482 --> 06:01.378
- Uhhh....
Alright, 20 bucks.

06:01.379 --> 06:02.481
- Deal.

06:02.482 --> 06:04.481
- Dad, for real?
- What?!?

06:04.482 --> 06:07.136
- You threw that jacket
in the garbage.

06:07.137 --> 06:08.516
- And now that Hudson wants it,

06:08.517 --> 06:10.171
you're gonna make him
pay for it?

06:10.172 --> 06:11.757
- Uh, n-noooo.

06:11.758 --> 06:14.137

06:59.551 --> 07:01.240
Kenzie and I, the Game Shakers,

07:01.241 --> 07:04.551
we're, uh, making a new
V.R. game about ski jumping.

07:06.344 --> 07:07.619
Ya like ski jumping?

07:07.620 --> 07:09.689
- It's all right.
- Yeah, me too.

07:11.689 --> 07:13.931
Anyway, uh, we need
a hot guy... uhhh...

07:15.482 --> 07:18.343
"a male", person...
like yourself...

07:18.344 --> 07:21.654
to be one of the
ski jumper... dudes.

07:21.655 --> 07:23.240
Ya know what I'm sayin'?

07:23.241 --> 07:25.481
- No.

07:25.482 --> 07:27.861
- Cool.
Help us anyway?

07:27.862 --> 07:29.481
Y'know before you go to Florida.

07:29.482 --> 07:32.482
- Sure.
- Okay, let's get goin' then!

07:34.344 --> 07:35.689
This way, come along.

07:38.344 --> 07:40.412
Now, Mason,
you just stand here, 'kay?

07:40.413 --> 07:42.585
Okay...

07:42.586 --> 07:44.033
Here I am, put it on my head.

07:44.034 --> 07:45.586
- Okay...

07:50.344 --> 07:51.689
- Now, just look up...

07:53.517 --> 07:54.826
- How do I look?

07:54.827 --> 07:56.516
Do the cameras make
my head look fat?

07:56.517 --> 07:58.724
- I dunno Babe.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.585
- Hey Mason, look.

08:02.586 --> 08:03.964
Like these cool cameras
on my head?

08:03.965 --> 08:06.654
- I don't judge people
by their hats.

08:06.655 --> 08:09.033
- Okay.
- Now Mason...

08:09.034 --> 08:11.343
you're playing the role
of the ski jump attendant.

08:11.344 --> 08:12.861
And when I say action,

08:12.862 --> 08:14.550
I want you to look
right at Babe and say:

08:14.551 --> 08:16.930
"Next skier...
You're clear to jump."

08:16.931 --> 08:19.309
- Cool.

08:19.310 --> 08:22.240
- And...

08:22.241 --> 08:23.551
ACTION!

08:25.034 --> 08:27.964
- Next skier...
You're clear to jump.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.136
- 'Kay.

08:30.137 --> 08:31.103
- Perfect.

08:31.104 --> 08:32.516
Okay, we got that line.

08:32.517 --> 08:33.964
- Now Mason, this time,

08:33.965 --> 08:35.965
you say the same line,
but closer to me.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.827
- Closer.

08:42.275 --> 08:43.862
- Closer.

08:47.517 --> 08:50.102
- We're almost touching noses.

08:50.103 --> 08:52.724
- Yeah...

09:02.034 --> 09:04.205
- You see, that's the problem
with a Cobb salad.

09:04.206 --> 09:05.550
They put chicken on it...

09:05.551 --> 09:07.447
and then put
hard boiled egg on it.

09:07.448 --> 09:09.999
Now think about that.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.447
A chicken's a mom,
and an egg is a chicken's baby,

09:12.448 --> 09:14.033
both layin' on the same salad,

09:14.034 --> 09:16.586
like some kinda sick
chicken family funeral.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.654
Hey, did you hear a word I said?

09:20.655 --> 09:22.516
- Nah, man.

09:22.517 --> 09:25.171
I'm too busy playing
with my new marble.

09:25.172 --> 09:27.310
- Lemme see that thing.

09:29.413 --> 09:31.275
This is a glass eyeball!

09:33.482 --> 09:34.862
- Hmmm...

09:36.758 --> 09:38.447
- Oh, there he is, next to Trip.

09:38.448 --> 09:40.826
- Oh hey Dad, I didn't know...
- Get that boy outta the chair

09:40.827 --> 09:42.240
so I could check his pockets.

09:42.241 --> 09:43.827
- Sure Dub.
- Okay!

09:47.689 --> 09:49.688
- Dad, what are you lookin' for?

09:49.689 --> 09:52.654
- Ronald Reagan's eyeball!

09:52.655 --> 09:54.378
- Who's Ronald Reagan?

09:54.379 --> 09:56.034
- Aw nooo!
- Seriously?!

09:57.482 --> 09:58.930
- Ronald Reagan used to be

09:58.931 --> 10:00.378
President of the United States.

10:00.379 --> 10:03.136
- He passed a few years ago.

10:03.137 --> 10:04.827
- "Passed" means "died"!

10:07.931 --> 10:10.067
- Reagan was one of
our top 40 presidents!

10:10.068 --> 10:12.723
So I bought his glass eyeball
for half a million dollars.

10:12.724 --> 10:14.274
And I know I left it
in that jacket!

10:14.275 --> 10:15.654
- Wait...

10:15.655 --> 10:17.619
is this what you're looking for?

10:17.620 --> 10:18.654
- Yeah, that's it!
Give it to me!

10:18.655 --> 10:20.447
- Nope-dee-dope.

10:20.448 --> 10:23.310
- He just said nope-dee-dope!

10:25.655 --> 10:27.309
- C'mon man, that glass
eyeball belongs to me!

10:27.310 --> 10:31.481
- Challenge.
- Challenge?!

10:31.482 --> 10:32.930
- According to
New York State law,

10:32.931 --> 10:36.619
when Party A legally transfers
an item to Party B

10:36.620 --> 10:38.033
via sale, trade, or donation

10:38.034 --> 10:41.343
Party B becomes the rightful
owner of the item

10:41.344 --> 10:44.206
and all contents
contained within.

10:46.068 --> 10:46.965
- He's right, Dub!

10:46.966 --> 10:49.724
- Looks like Hudson's gotcha.

10:51.586 --> 10:53.792
- Alright, "Mister Hudson"...

10:53.793 --> 10:57.033
how much ya want
for that glass eyeball?

10:57.034 --> 10:59.310
- Oh, I wouldn't
sell this for money.

11:00.724 --> 11:02.827
- Dang it!

11:06.758 --> 11:10.309
- Why do you want me
on my motorcycle?

11:10.310 --> 11:11.964
- 'Cuz... that's the new thing.

11:11.965 --> 11:13.654
Y'know, ski jumping,
in the snow,

11:13.655 --> 11:16.274
on a... motorcycle.

11:16.275 --> 11:21.000
- Yeah, they call it...
"snowdercycling."

11:23.206 --> 11:24.412
- So Mason, uh...

11:24.413 --> 11:26.413
you just pretend you're
riding your motorcycle.

11:27.758 --> 11:30.102
- And then you
turn around and say:

11:30.103 --> 11:32.792
"Hold on to me tight,
and never let go."

11:32.793 --> 11:35.343
- Where are you gonna be?

11:35.344 --> 11:38.688
- Hmmm, how 'bout...

11:38.689 --> 11:41.585
here?

11:41.586 --> 11:43.827
- Okay, rolling.

11:45.793 --> 11:48.619
- Hold on to me tight.
And never let go.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.103
- I won't baby.

11:54.517 --> 11:56.412
- Okay, that was great.

11:56.413 --> 11:57.792
Babe, we need anything else?

11:57.793 --> 11:59.654
- Uh, yeah...

11:59.655 --> 12:02.930
Mason, just look at me and say:

12:02.931 --> 12:06.343
"I love... ukuleles."

12:06.344 --> 12:07.792
- All right.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.619
- But, take a pause
between "u" and "kuleles."

12:10.620 --> 12:11.895
- Why?

12:11.896 --> 12:13.964
- It's the traditional...

12:13.965 --> 12:16.516
Hawaiian pronunciation.

12:16.517 --> 12:18.241
Whenever you're ready.

12:21.517 --> 12:23.516
I love you...

12:23.517 --> 12:25.585
kuleles.

12:25.586 --> 12:27.619

12:27.620 --> 12:29.241
kuleles.

12:30.413 --> 12:32.827
- All right, k'cut.

12:34.586 --> 12:36.931

12:37.896 --> 12:38.964

Can't ya stay?

12:38.965 --> 12:40.619
I'll make you a sandwich.

12:40.620 --> 12:41.654
What's your favorite
kind of sandwich?

12:41.655 --> 12:43.654
Ham? Go get ham.

12:43.655 --> 12:45.516
- Nah, no ham.

12:45.517 --> 12:47.068
I love pigs.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.757
I gotta pack for Florida.

12:50.758 --> 12:52.137

13:14.206 --> 13:15.757

13:15.758 --> 13:17.550

13:17.551 --> 13:19.999
- Gross!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.516
I don't wanna hold something

13:21.517 --> 13:22.999

a famous man's head.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.481
- Whatever.

13:24.482 --> 13:26.241
I'm gonna go show my
eyeball the cafeteria.

13:27.551 --> 13:29.516
- Why?

13:29.517 --> 13:30.655
- He hasn't seen it yet.

13:34.793 --> 13:36.033
- Kenz! Hey...

13:36.034 --> 13:37.102

Now, just wait for Mason to...

14:00.103 --> 14:02.724
- Shhh, stop talking!

14:04.172 --> 14:06.792
What do I do next?

14:06.793 --> 14:08.481
- Ask Mason a question.

14:08.482 --> 14:11.136
- Uh okay, uh...

14:11.137 --> 14:14.102
Hey Mason.
