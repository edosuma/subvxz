Cue "Love Sick," Bob Dylan,

00:55.570 --> 00:57.938
track one, "Time Out of Mind."

01:02.311 --> 01:03.944
♪ I'm walking... ♪

01:03.946 --> 01:07.280
Yeah, that's good.

01:07.282 --> 01:09.783
♪ Through streets
that are dead... ♪

01:09.785 --> 01:12.786
That's real good.

01:14.356 --> 01:16.357
We open tight on a man.

01:16.359 --> 01:19.325
Oh, hold up, hold up, hold up,
hold up, let me rephrase.

01:19.327 --> 01:22.762
We open on our hero.

01:22.764 --> 01:26.266
We push in on his face.

01:26.268 --> 01:28.869
Motherfucker,
I said push in on that shit.

01:30.339 --> 01:32.607
Mid-20s, handsome, gay...

01:32.609 --> 01:34.607
gay in that cool
cat kind of way.

01:34.609 --> 01:36.410
Gay like
"Billy on the Street" gay.

01:36.412 --> 01:40.280
Gay like, "It's who I am,
it's not all I am, baby."

01:40.282 --> 01:44.251
Yeah, that's one
cool cat we got over here.

01:44.253 --> 01:47.754
But right now,
this cat's anything but cool.

01:47.756 --> 01:49.390
This cat's in crisis.

01:49.392 --> 01:52.259
I feel ashamed, I guess.

01:52.261 --> 01:55.262
I know this doesn't
make me look very good,

01:55.264 --> 01:59.066
but it's, uh,
breaking me, and, um...

01:59.068 --> 02:00.235
Let it go, brother,

02:00.237 --> 02:01.869
let it go like a proud asshole.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.771
Let it go, let it go.

02:03.773 --> 02:05.372
I just...

02:05.374 --> 02:08.074
He and I have been
together for so long.

02:08.076 --> 02:11.311
I know it sounds cliché,
but I guess...

02:11.313 --> 02:13.714
I like knowing he's
on my team, you know?

02:13.716 --> 02:15.849
I know, my brother.
I hear you, my brother.

02:15.851 --> 02:17.952
Let it go.

02:17.954 --> 02:19.620
Well, this new guy
has come along.

02:19.622 --> 02:20.754
Hmm, proceed.

02:20.756 --> 02:22.823
He's new, he's exciting,

02:22.825 --> 02:26.026
and he's so much younger.

02:26.028 --> 02:28.130
Aw, ain't no shame, brother.

02:29.898 --> 02:32.066
I know I can't stick
with someone out of loyalty.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.935
And you know this.

02:33.937 --> 02:35.835
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

02:35.837 --> 02:38.104
I'm gonna put Sterling Shepard
in my flex wide receiver spot

02:38.106 --> 02:39.941
and drop Larry Fitzgerald

02:39.943 --> 02:42.609
and maybe I'll pick up
Miami D off waivers, too.

02:42.611 --> 02:44.110
Say what now?

02:44.112 --> 02:46.180
Henry.

02:46.182 --> 02:49.449
You know we've talked about how
obsessing over fantasy football

02:49.451 --> 02:52.853
can't simply replace
obsessing over food.

02:52.855 --> 02:54.254
Okay, my bad.

02:54.256 --> 02:57.924
That motherfucker
is not our hero.

02:57.926 --> 03:00.694
Look at that pretty
therapist over there.

03:00.696 --> 03:04.998
Calming his anorexic fantasy
football-loving ass down.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.967
Push in on her for a sec.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.436
Okay.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.871
I said push in, man! Come on!

03:11.873 --> 03:14.074
Oh, yeah.

03:14.076 --> 03:16.075
Now I'm seeing it.

03:16.077 --> 03:18.746
That's a hero right there.

03:18.748 --> 03:22.549
Amazing smile,
the silky smooth hair.

03:22.551 --> 03:25.053
Let me look at you, girl.

03:25.055 --> 03:28.156
Whoo! That's what
I'm talking 'bout.

03:28.158 --> 03:30.891
Now we in bidness,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:30.893 --> 03:34.861
We got ourselves a hero.

03:34.863 --> 03:37.198
♪ And I wonder... ♪

03:37.200 --> 03:40.501
Now, like any great hero,
our hero wasn't perfect.

03:40.503 --> 03:42.436
She smoked, first of all,

03:42.438 --> 03:44.972
which they normally don't
let you show in movies anymore,

03:44.974 --> 03:47.206
even though we all
still smoke sometimes.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.309
You know you smoke sometimes.

03:49.311 --> 03:51.378
You and the wife
have a date night,

03:51.380 --> 03:53.580
you each have two martinis,
you guys are feeling wild

03:53.582 --> 03:56.084
so you buy a pack of
smokes on the way home

03:56.086 --> 03:58.352
and you each smoke one
in the 7-Eleven parking lot.

03:58.354 --> 04:00.420
Then she makes you
throw out the pack,

04:00.422 --> 04:03.524
but instead of throwing it
out, you hide it in a plant,

04:03.526 --> 04:05.827
and some nights,
you sneak out and have one.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.728
But she smells
that shit on you

04:07.730 --> 04:10.063
like she's
a nicotine detective.

04:10.065 --> 04:12.099
She smells that shit on you

04:12.101 --> 04:15.235
like she's Mariska Hargitay
on "Law & Order: SVU,"

04:15.237 --> 04:16.970
- Hey.
- Marg Helgenberger on "CSI,"

04:16.971 --> 04:18.071

04:38.727 --> 04:40.861
Probably a little banged up,
but she's gonna be fine.

07:55.825 --> 07:57.890
Will loved his
wife Abby with an intensity

07:57.892 --> 07:59.660
usually reserved for stalkers.

07:59.662 --> 08:03.030
She was everything a man
could ask for in a wife.

08:03.032 --> 08:05.064
She was nurturing
and she was beautiful,

08:05.066 --> 08:07.333
and she ate any kind of
sushi the chef served to her,

08:07.335 --> 08:09.169
even the uni.

08:09.171 --> 08:11.205

08:11.207 --> 08:13.907
Abby Dempsey was
absolutely perfect.

08:13.909 --> 08:16.075
At least back then she was.

- ...for, like, a month.
- Because... I know,

08:33.428 --> 08:35.395
- because I'm in a phase.
- I can't hear this, like,

08:35.398 --> 08:37.030

Everybody just wrote him off.

08:50.847 --> 08:53.046
They said you don't come
back from the crazy he had,

08:53.048 --> 08:54.447
and then boom.

08:54.449 --> 08:56.550
'97, "Time Out of Mind."

08:56.552 --> 08:59.353
He won three Grammys,
including Album of the Year.

08:59.355 --> 09:02.254
He beat Radiohead
and Paul McCartney.

09:02.256 --> 09:05.057

unexpected genius.

09:05.059 --> 09:07.460
Just hard and dark and...

09:13.736 --> 09:15.301

everyone to eat a dick.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.622
- But you said that...
- We're gonna be late.

10:41.624 --> 10:43.223
You said that we could
listen to Smash Mouth after.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.124
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did.

10:45.126 --> 10:47.329
Hey.

10:48.831 --> 10:50.229
Are you pregnant?

10:52.068 --> 10:54.000
What's going on here?

You ever gonna

12:09.444 --> 12:12.080
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.182
That's good to know.

12:16.184 --> 12:18.218
All right.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.287
I'll see you around.

12:20.289 --> 12:22.489
Abby, I'm waiting
for the right moment

12:22.491 --> 12:23.956
'cause when I ask you out,

12:23.958 --> 12:25.994
there's not gonna be
any turning back for me.

12:28.297 --> 12:31.331
I'm not gonna date anybody
else for the rest of my life,

12:31.333 --> 12:34.033
I'm not gonna love anybody
else for the rest of my life,

12:34.035 --> 12:36.136
I'm not gonna really
care about anything else

12:36.138 --> 12:38.508
for the rest of my life.

12:40.042 --> 12:43.442
I'm waiting for
the right moment, Abby,

12:43.444 --> 12:46.080
'cause when I ask you out,

12:46.082 --> 12:50.149
it's gonna be the most
important moment of my life.

12:50.151 --> 12:53.354
And I just want to make
sure that I get it right.

13:10.072 --> 13:13.172
So, how you doing today, Will?

13:13.174 --> 13:15.441
Will.

13:15.443 --> 13:17.744
Sorry. Did you say something?

13:17.746 --> 13:20.281
Yes, I said,
"How are you doing?"

13:20.283 --> 13:22.282
Uh... you know.

13:22.284 --> 13:24.051
Same.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.489
Okay.

13:28.757 --> 13:30.856
I tried masturbating
the other day.

13:30.858 --> 13:33.893
I tried thinking of Abby, but
I couldn't really get it done,

13:33.895 --> 13:37.129
so then I, um...

13:37.131 --> 13:40.533
I tried thinking of you...

13:40.535 --> 13:43.802
but, you know,
you jerk off to your therapist,

13:43.804 --> 13:45.873
you should be
institutionalized.

13:45.875 --> 13:49.008
You were institutionalized.

13:49.010 --> 13:50.847
Touché.

14:00.956 --> 14:03.456
She left six months ago today.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.624
That's right.

14:05.626 --> 14:07.694
And you've been in a facility

14:07.696 --> 14:09.396
for almost half that time,

14:09.398 --> 14:12.802
and now I, I can't
help but wonder...

14:16.304 --> 14:18.241
Will, are you listening to me?

14:19.475 --> 14:21.074
Okay.

14:21.076 --> 14:22.942
So, I'm just wondering
how you're doing

14:22.944 --> 14:25.744
being back in the world again.

14:25.746 --> 14:28.617
Uh, you know. Same.

14:30.586 --> 14:34.488
I did the writing exercise
you asked me to do.

14:34.490 --> 14:36.757
Really? I'm surprised.

14:36.759 --> 14:39.058
You've been so resistant
to writing down your feelings.

14:39.060 --> 14:41.795
Oh, no, I didn't do that.
I wrote a movie instead.

14:41.797 --> 14:45.398
I did, like, uh, like, well,
like, five pages of a movie.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.167
It was very bad.

14:48.169 --> 14:50.503
Abby and I always talked about
writing a screenplay together.

14:50.505 --> 14:52.004
Like a...

14:52.006 --> 14:54.173
husband and wife
Tarantino, you know?

14:55.711 --> 14:57.377
...I'm "Super Fly T.N.T."

14:57.379 --> 14:59.144
You wouldn't have liked it.

14:59.146 --> 15:01.181
My screenplay.

15:01.183 --> 15:03.816
You were in it, kind of.

15:03.818 --> 15:07.924
Abby wasn't, which, you know,
I know was the whole point.

15:10.893 --> 15:14.293
I met this guy,
when I was institutionalized.

15:14.295 --> 15:17.297
This really sweet guy.

15:17.299 --> 15:19.599
Horrible life.

15:19.601 --> 15:22.835
All he could talk about without
crying was fantasy football,

15:22.837 --> 15:25.274
so he talked about it a lot.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.008
I liked that guy.

15:29.010 --> 15:30.344
Great face.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.180
A movie star face, you know.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.514
Oh, poor motherfucker
was the only guy there

15:35.516 --> 15:37.149
that seemed worse
off than I was.

15:37.151 --> 15:39.152
We'd have dinner
every night together.

15:39.154 --> 15:41.120
And then one night
he didn't show up,

15:41.122 --> 15:43.556
which sucked for him
'cause it was pizza night.

15:43.558 --> 15:45.558
Turned out he'd...

15:48.597 --> 15:51.100
How'd that make you feel?

15:52.800 --> 15:54.903
Happy for him.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.672
Or at least relieved.

15:59.674 --> 16:02.341
I mean, you know,
he was pretty miserable.

16:02.343 --> 16:04.411
And I'm no doctor,

16:04.413 --> 16:06.779
but I don't think he's
ever gonna feel any better.

16:06.781 --> 16:09.849
Okay, well, that brings me
back to my initial question.

16:09.851 --> 16:11.320
How are you feeling?

16:13.722 --> 16:16.523
Uh, you know. Same.

16:16.525 --> 16:18.325
You keep saying that.

16:18.327 --> 16:20.259
I keep meaning it.

16:20.261 --> 16:24.299
Have you spoken to her,
Will, since you've been out?

16:25.768 --> 16:27.835
Abby, please,
can you come back to me?

16:27.837 --> 16:30.269
- I'm sorry.
- This sucks, man.

16:30.271 --> 16:32.638
- This fucking sucks.
- I got to go. I'm sorry.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.639
- I got to go.
- Please.

16:35.610 --> 16:37.411
No.

16:37.413 --> 16:41.648
Have you been to your
parents', like we discussed?

16:41.650 --> 16:43.850
I don't want to.

16:43.852 --> 16:46.753
Will, part of the reason
that you were discharged

16:46.755 --> 16:48.321
and put into my...

16:48.323 --> 16:50.793
I don't want to!

16:54.896 --> 16:57.163
Sorry. That was weird.

16:57.165 --> 17:01.634
Yesterday, you said that
you'd been feeling aimless.

17:01.636 --> 17:05.438
Well, I usually have
pretty good aim, so...

less than a year.

Yeah, I know.

18:01.095 --> 18:02.762

incredible restraint

18:02.764 --> 18:04.263

Say yes.

- No, I don't.

18:08.169 --> 18:10.003
You want to say
yes so bad it hurts.

18:10.005 --> 18:13.340
- You're cocky.
- I'm right.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.042
Say yes.

18:15.044 --> 18:16.376
Say yes.

Stop it.

18:23.119 --> 18:25.185
Please say,
"Yes, I'll marry you,"

18:25.187 --> 18:26.386
or I'll fucking shoot myself...

18:26.388 --> 18:28.421
- Stop! Will!
- Say, "Yes, I'll marry you."

18:28.423 --> 18:30.490
Stop!

18:30.492 --> 18:32.394
Sorry. That was weird.

18:35.730 --> 18:38.965
I love you.

18:38.967 --> 18:42.836
You're the love of my life,
I'm sure of it.

18:42.838 --> 18:47.107
But sometimes it scares
me how much you feel.

18:47.109 --> 18:48.774
You know?

18:48.776 --> 18:50.542
It's not something
I ever thought I would...

18:50.544 --> 18:52.515
be scared of, but...

18:57.119 --> 19:02.224
I may not be equipped
to be loved this much.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.594
I'll find another way.

19:08.596 --> 19:10.362
- No...
- I'll find another way.

19:10.364 --> 19:12.032
Hey. I will.

19:12.034 --> 19:13.599
I will love you

19:13.601 --> 19:17.303
however you're best
equipped to handle it, Abby.

19:17.305 --> 19:18.871
I will love you...

19:18.873 --> 19:22.143

I mean, I want kids, too,

20:36.584 --> 20:38.120
Okay.

20:39.987 --> 20:42.188
Dog first. Small dog.

20:42.190 --> 20:43.625
Yeah.

20:46.261 --> 20:49.795
My parents died young;
it makes me sad sometimes.

20:49.797 --> 20:52.064
I know.

20:52.066 --> 20:54.900
It'd probably make me
a terrible mother.

20:54.902 --> 20:57.538
I disagree, but... okay.

20:59.207 --> 21:00.773
Mainly, my big
thing is the dog.

21:00.775 --> 21:03.243
Small dog.

21:03.245 --> 21:06.015
I am totally on board
with the dog idea.

21:08.883 --> 21:11.019
Okay, I'll marry you.

21:14.723 --> 21:18.657
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:18.659 --> 21:20.327
You want to meet my parents?

21:22.264 --> 21:24.198
Sure.

21:28.136 --> 21:30.306
Cool.

21:37.411 --> 21:39.081
Thanks.

21:41.149 --> 21:43.582
- How are you?!
- Oh, my God, Abby!

21:43.584 --> 21:44.984
Look at you!

21:44.986 --> 21:46.017
- Oh...
- Oh, you look beautiful!

21:46.019 --> 21:47.087
- How are you both?
- Great.

21:47.089 --> 21:48.355
- Everybody's good?
- Yeah.

21:48.357 --> 21:49.421
- Hey, buddy boy.
- Hey, Pop.

21:49.423 --> 21:51.057
- Look at you!
- How are you, man?

21:51.059 --> 21:52.192
- Good.
- Oh, my...

21:52.194 --> 21:53.259
- You're positively...
- Revolting.

21:53.261 --> 21:55.261
- No! Stop. No.
- Yeah. And gassy.

21:55.263 --> 21:57.263
- You popped.
- She is, Mom. She's really gassy.

21:57.265 --> 21:59.299
- That means it's gonna be a boy.
- Really?

21:59.301 --> 22:00.867
Yeah. I practically
needed a hazmat suit

22:00.869 --> 22:01.801
when your mother was
pregnant with you.

22:01.803 --> 22:03.002
Stop that!

22:03.004 --> 22:04.103
- It's true.
- Farts mean it's a boy!

22:04.105 --> 22:05.137
That almost makes
them worth it.

22:05.139 --> 22:06.472
Anything happening down there?

22:06.474 --> 22:08.742
Linda, I'm afraid to
ask, but did you make that...

22:08.744 --> 22:10.944
Meat loaf is coming
out of the oven right now.

22:10.946 --> 22:12.744
- Oh, yeah!
- I have never craved anything

22:12.746 --> 22:14.813
like this in my life. Lead me
to that meat loaf and...

22:14.815 --> 22:16.249
I hate fucking meat loaf.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.283
...and backhanded
compliment me all day long.

22:18.285 --> 22:20.552
I'm just grateful she didn't
burn down the fucking kitchen.

22:20.554 --> 22:22.388
What'd you do to get the foot

22:22.390 --> 22:23.889
- unstuck from the...
- You just push.

22:23.891 --> 22:25.425
I'm not a big fan of, like,

22:25.427 --> 22:26.859
when the face goes like this...

22:26.861 --> 22:27.959
Dog dishes.

22:27.961 --> 22:29.395
...against the
outside of the belly.

22:29.397 --> 22:31.130
- It's like an alien.
- How do you know it's the face?

22:31.132 --> 22:32.831
- Looks like an alien.
- You actually see the face?

22:32.833 --> 22:34.567
- I'm pretty sure it's a face.
- No, I don't... that's creepy.

22:34.569 --> 22:35.901
Is it possible
that it's clawing out?

22:35.903 --> 22:37.670
This is... Mom.

22:37.672 --> 22:40.106
You're aware that the baby's
not gonna actually live with

22:40.108 --> 22:41.340
- you guys, right?
- I got a little carried away.

22:41.342 --> 22:43.209
- This one's very cute.
- Sue me.

22:43.211 --> 22:44.543
- Isn't that cute?
- Yes.

22:44.545 --> 22:46.346
You better eat some of this
before she gets it all.

22:46.348 --> 22:47.480
- Okay.
- Baby clothes, baby jumpers.

22:47.482 --> 22:48.982
Tell me something,
what the hell's

22:48.984 --> 22:52.284
a baby jumper for, anyway?

22:52.286 --> 22:54.153
Why does a baby need to jump?

22:54.155 --> 22:55.353
All I know is I spend all day

22:55.355 --> 22:57.791
breaking down
the goddamn Amazon boxes.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.091
Oh, shush, you.

22:59.093 --> 23:00.793
Here, honey, a little
bit more. Come on.

23:00.795 --> 23:02.329
He's good. He's good.

23:02.331 --> 23:04.597
- Ay. Ay-yi-yi.
- There's two, there's two of me.

23:05.767 --> 23:07.533
- Oh.
- Oh, piggy-wiggy.

23:07.535 --> 23:09.869
I can't believe
I'm gonna be a grandma!

23:09.871 --> 23:11.370
I still can't believe it.

23:11.372 --> 23:12.938
- All right, settle down.
- Still can't believe it.

23:12.940 --> 23:14.072
- Abby?
- Mm-hmm?

23:14.074 --> 23:15.440
Don't take this the wrong way.

23:15.442 --> 23:16.943
- Oh, here it comes.
- Yep.

23:16.945 --> 23:18.610
But, selfishly speaking,

23:18.612 --> 23:20.746
I'm just so glad
your parents are dead.

23:22.184 --> 23:24.082
- And... boom.
- Oh, stop it.

23:24.084 --> 23:25.819
Abby knows what I mean.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.320
Really, yeah?
She does? You do?

23:27.322 --> 23:28.987
She's gonna explain.

23:28.989 --> 23:32.391
What I mean is...
all I ever wanted

23:32.393 --> 23:34.593
was for Will to marry a
woman with dead parents,

23:34.595 --> 23:36.262
so I wouldn't have to
share the grandchildren,

23:36.264 --> 23:37.330
and, and he did.

23:37.332 --> 23:40.332
I mean, my prayer came true.

23:40.334 --> 23:42.034
Jesus Christ, Mom!

23:42.036 --> 23:44.070
It's okay!
She knows what I mean.

23:46.041 --> 23:47.874
- Hey, Abby, by the way...
- Mm.

23:47.876 --> 23:49.908
...did you get a look at
that book I sent you yet?

23:49.910 --> 23:50.976
No.

23:50.978 --> 23:52.111
It's really good.
It's about preschool

23:52.113 --> 23:53.480
- and anxiety separation.
- Oh, good.

23:53.482 --> 23:56.215
That feels like a first
priority thing.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.417
'Cause when you...

23:58.419 --> 24:01.120
Sorry, I will, I will admit.
I admit, I'm sorry.

24:01.122 --> 24:02.888
Just talk about
her dead parents again, Mom.

24:04.325 --> 24:06.024
Thank you.

24:06.026 --> 24:07.760
- It's about separation anxiety.
- Yeah.

24:07.762 --> 24:09.661
So when you drop 'em off at
preschool for the first day...

24:09.663 --> 24:12.197
...and they, they go
nuts and they go limp.

24:12.199 --> 24:14.166
- Yeah.
- Live your own life!

24:14.168 --> 24:15.767
- Mind your own fucking...
- Shush. Shush.

24:15.769 --> 24:18.236
When you drop
the kid off at preschool,

24:18.238 --> 24:20.039
if they get hysterical
and inconsolable...

24:20.041 --> 24:21.707
Both Abby's parents

24:21.709 --> 24:24.610
died in a car accident
when she was a little girl.

24:24.612 --> 24:28.447
Abby was in the car.
She was seven.

24:28.449 --> 24:31.417
Okay.

24:31.419 --> 24:33.852
"Okay" seems kind of
like a strange response

24:33.854 --> 24:36.288
to that new information.

24:36.290 --> 24:38.925
Well, I was caught
a little off guard.

24:38.927 --> 24:41.060
You don't talk
about Abby a lot.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.995
You don't ask about her a lot.

24:43.997 --> 24:46.866
Will, I ask about
her constantly.

24:46.868 --> 24:49.735
Tomato, potato.

24:49.737 --> 24:51.471
Tomato, to-mah-to.

24:51.473 --> 24:54.506
Let's just call
the whole thing off.

24:54.508 --> 24:57.843
Well, the sessions
are mandated, so...

24:57.845 --> 25:00.647
No. Uh, the...

25:00.649 --> 25:02.215
- ...the song, the...
- What? I... I'm not following.

25:02.217 --> 25:03.849
Oh, my God,

25:03.851 --> 25:06.185
this is some kind of
rhythm we have, huh, Doc?

25:06.187 --> 25:08.790
Maybe this is why
I can't jerk off to you.

25:10.725 --> 25:12.891
Sorry, that was
very inappropriate.

25:12.893 --> 25:14.359
I was institutionalized.

25:14.361 --> 25:16.763
Why don't you just
tell me about Abby.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.064
What, what was she like?
I'd like to hear about her.

25:19.066 --> 25:20.934
You want me to tell
you about Abby?

25:20.936 --> 25:23.436
Well, then you've come
to the right place, Doc,

25:23.438 --> 25:27.040
because I am the foremost
expert on all things Abby.

25:27.042 --> 25:28.944
Or... I was.

25:30.012 --> 25:31.410
No, I still am.

25:31.412 --> 25:32.946
I mean, it's not like somebody
else has learned more about

25:32.948 --> 25:33.980
her in the last six months.

25:33.982 --> 25:35.080
Or I guess somebody could have.

25:35.082 --> 25:37.550
I mean... I've been locked away

25:37.552 --> 25:40.219
and Lord knows what she's
been up to, wherever she is.

25:40.221 --> 25:42.288
- Will?
- Right.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.322
You want to know about Abby.

25:43.324 --> 25:44.523
Let me tell you about Abby.

25:44.525 --> 25:46.292
You got it.
Last one. Last one.

25:46.294 --> 25:51.296
Abby Lesher was
born June 30, 1985.

25:51.298 --> 25:54.266
Legend has it that,
when she was born,

25:54.268 --> 25:57.336
she didn't make a single peep.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.473
For five minutes, little
Abby just laid there

26:00.475 --> 26:02.541
taking in the world around her,

26:02.543 --> 26:05.311
- not so much as a single cry.
- Hi.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.513
In the years to come, her
parents would always say,

26:07.515 --> 26:09.682
"There wasn't anything
wrong with little Abby."

26:09.684 --> 26:13.552
She just didn't have
anything to say yet."

26:13.554 --> 26:16.088
Now keep in mind, I'm
getting all this secondhand.

26:16.090 --> 26:18.659
I've never met any of the
people here, except for Abby.

26:20.428 --> 26:23.663
Her parents died pretty soon.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.565
Long before I come
into the picture.

26:26.567 --> 26:28.568
- No, I know.
- And it's not like

26:28.570 --> 26:30.135
I know the doctor
or the nurses here.

26:30.137 --> 26:31.370
- Why would I?
- Right.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.205
Please continue, Will.

26:33.207 --> 26:34.642
Okay.

26:36.044 --> 26:40.480
By all accounts, Abby's
childhood was a happy one.

26:40.482 --> 26:42.048
Family, I've gathered you
here today 'cause I, I need

26:42.050 --> 26:45.118
to talk about something very
serious, so no laughing.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.985
Uh, as you may have noticed,

26:46.987 --> 26:49.855
I... have developed a bit
of a drinking problem.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.657
Her parents,
Jack and Elizabeth,

26:52.659 --> 26:55.427
were kindhearted and openhearted

26:55.429 --> 26:56.862
and all the other
kinds of "hearted."

26:56.864 --> 26:58.598
They were literally both
elementary school teachers.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.968
That's actually how
they, how they met.

27:09.276 --> 27:12.012
Mind if I sit?

27:13.480 --> 27:15.048
If Abby's mother knew

27:15.050 --> 27:17.483
that she would meet her future
husband at exactly that moment,

27:17.485 --> 27:19.752
you think she would have
taken such a big old bite

27:19.754 --> 27:22.021
of that peanut butter
and jelly sandwich?

27:22.023 --> 27:23.925
Um...

27:26.460 --> 27:29.561
- Would you like some water?
- Mm.

27:29.563 --> 27:32.865
Wow. You fit half the
sandwich in your mouth.

27:35.602 --> 27:38.103
So strange to think about.

27:38.105 --> 27:40.807
How a completely random moment
involving peanut butter,

27:40.809 --> 27:44.510
a moment that happened
way before I was born,

27:44.512 --> 27:46.579
would shape my entire life.

27:47.948 --> 27:50.485
Are you glad it happened?

27:53.420 --> 27:57.256
Ah, well, Dr. Morris,
that is the big question.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.358
Isn't it? Because if
it hadn't happened,

27:59.360 --> 28:00.693
Abby's parents would
never have met.

28:00.695 --> 28:03.128
They'd never have married,
they'd never have

28:03.130 --> 28:05.430
honeymooned in Aruba
where they conceived Abby.

28:05.432 --> 28:07.233
They'd never have seen her

28:07.235 --> 28:08.734
come into the world
without a peep.

28:08.736 --> 28:11.204
They'd never have watched
her blonde hair turn brown

28:11.206 --> 28:12.605
as she got older.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.940
They'd never have watched her
become obsessed with dancing

28:14.942 --> 28:16.007
and then soccer

28:16.009 --> 28:19.244
and then horses and,
of course, Christmas.

28:19.246 --> 28:20.679
Always Christmas.

28:20.681 --> 28:23.948
The lights, the gifts,
and above all, the Rockettes.

28:23.950 --> 28:26.385
So obsessed with the
Rockettes was Abby

28:26.387 --> 28:28.655
that every year,
every single year,

28:28.657 --> 28:30.523
her parents would have
to drive her into town

28:30.525 --> 28:31.991
to watch the Rockettes perform.

28:31.993 --> 28:35.429
Every single year,
except that one year...

28:39.100 --> 28:41.132
Abby's parents died instantly.

28:41.134 --> 28:43.735
Abby was trapped
in the backseat of the car

28:43.737 --> 28:47.372
with them for over an hour
before they got her out.

28:47.374 --> 28:48.709
Her father...

28:50.611 --> 28:53.715
...her father was decapitated
by the steering column.

28:55.850 --> 28:57.783
I know, right?

28:57.785 --> 28:59.819
That's the detail that
always gets everybody.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.821
I mean, the story in and of
itself is tragic of course,

29:01.823 --> 29:04.657
but when you give
someone that image,

29:04.659 --> 29:07.292
that singular image of
a seven year old girl

29:07.294 --> 29:09.161
trapped in the
backseat of a car

29:09.163 --> 29:10.629
with her decapitated father,

29:10.631 --> 29:14.602
well, then it really
just lands, doesn't it?

29:16.772 --> 29:20.438
Anyhoo, you wanted to
know about Abby, so...

29:20.440 --> 29:22.442
I'll continue,
but be forewarned,

29:22.444 --> 29:24.077
her next decade isn't so great.

29:26.547 --> 29:29.815
Abby's parents didn't
plan on dying together,

29:29.817 --> 29:32.185
so there was no will and
there was no plan for Abby.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.320
And seeing as all her
grandparents were deceased,

29:34.322 --> 29:37.659
Abby's Uncle Joe got custody.

29:41.728 --> 29:43.730
Now, Uncle Joe
wasn't a nice man.

29:43.732 --> 29:45.531
And when I say he
wasn't a nice man,

29:45.533 --> 29:47.300
I don't mean like
he didn't hug her.

29:47.302 --> 29:49.702
I mean, he bought her a
puppy and then he killed it

29:49.704 --> 29:51.036
when it chewed up his couch.

29:51.038 --> 29:52.771
I mean, he sporadically
molested her

29:52.773 --> 29:54.473
for the better
part of six years,

29:54.475 --> 29:56.641
until, at 15 years old,

29:56.643 --> 29:58.676
Abby borrowed a gun from
some wannabe gangbanger

29:58.678 --> 30:00.946
from her high school, she
pointed it at Uncle Joe's head

30:00.948 --> 30:03.649
and said in no
uncertain terms...

30:03.651 --> 30:05.850
I'll fucking kill you if
you ever touch me again.

30:05.852 --> 30:07.453
And then she shot
him in the knee,

30:07.455 --> 30:08.553
so he knew she wasn't playing.

30:10.858 --> 30:12.590
Fuck! Ow!

30:15.362 --> 30:17.362
It's like a movie, right?

30:17.364 --> 30:20.765
I always pictured a young
Natalie Portman playing her.

30:20.767 --> 30:22.935
I don't know who that is.

30:22.937 --> 30:25.338
You don't know who
Natalie Portman is?

30:25.340 --> 30:27.506
- No.
- Doc, you got to get out more.

30:27.508 --> 30:29.140
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

30:29.142 --> 30:30.208
I'll tell you what.

30:30.210 --> 30:31.644
One of these nights,
we'll do, like, a marathon

30:31.646 --> 30:33.245
of early Portman.

30:33.247 --> 30:35.514
Beautiful Girls,
The Professional.

30:35.516 --> 30:37.050
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

30:37.052 --> 30:38.850
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:38.852 --> 30:41.420
Right.

30:41.422 --> 30:43.955
Okay, well, uh...

30:43.957 --> 30:45.925
well, things got
better from there.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.760
Obviously, damage
had been done.

30:47.762 --> 30:49.829
Decapitated father, molesting
uncle, you don't just, like,

30:49.831 --> 30:51.996
bounce back from
that shit, but...

30:51.998 --> 30:57.102
Abby was smart, determined,
a dreamer, a reader.

30:57.104 --> 31:00.807
She hunkered down, she
got herself into college,

31:00.809 --> 31:02.774
started seeing a
therapist on campus

31:02.776 --> 31:05.645
who truly changed her life.

31:05.647 --> 31:07.182
She even made a
very close friend.

31:19.126 --> 31:21.260
You're gonna get me kicked out.

31:21.262 --> 31:23.227
Could you please stop?

31:23.229 --> 31:25.598
I'm so sorry.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.867
Oh, my God, Doc,
look. Oh, my God.

31:27.869 --> 31:30.002
Look.

31:30.004 --> 31:31.637
Oh.

31:31.639 --> 31:34.139
Look at me. This is what
I looked like in college.

31:34.141 --> 31:37.076
I have 491 more pages.

31:37.078 --> 31:40.079
Oh, my God, look
how young I look.

31:40.081 --> 31:42.380
No, no, I think you look
very much the same.

31:42.382 --> 31:44.850
Oh, well, I think I look like
a completely different person.

31:44.852 --> 31:47.552
Yeah, tomato, to-mah-to.

31:47.554 --> 31:50.822
Doc, look at us.

31:50.824 --> 31:52.757
Maybe we have a
chance after all.

31:52.759 --> 31:54.827
Yeah.

31:54.829 --> 31:58.997
Anyway, Abby really came
into her own in college.

31:58.999 --> 32:01.032
My aim.

32:01.034 --> 32:03.569
She engaged in
the outside world,

32:03.571 --> 32:05.705
she became extremely popular,

32:05.707 --> 32:07.907
she even fell in love.

32:07.909 --> 32:11.209
Not to toot my own
horn, but toot, toot!

32:11.211 --> 32:13.779
She graduated top of her class
with an English lit degree.

32:13.781 --> 32:15.880
Yeah, she wrote
her thesis on...

32:15.882 --> 32:17.616
The Unreliable Narrator!

32:17.618 --> 32:19.451
The Unreliable Narrator.

32:19.453 --> 32:20.820
- What's that?
- My thesis.

32:20.822 --> 32:22.254
Hey, guys, what's up?

32:22.256 --> 32:25.190
Unreliable narrators are
considered a device, right?

32:25.192 --> 32:26.658
Don't answer.
They are. They are.

32:26.660 --> 32:28.494
And they don't get a
lot of literary analysis

32:28.496 --> 32:30.094
because it's a
gimmick, it's a trick.

32:30.096 --> 32:32.630
I mean, "Canterbury Tales"
gets a, gets a shout-out

32:32.632 --> 32:34.265
because, you know, it's good,

32:34.267 --> 32:37.802
but then typically, it's used
for popcorn crime novels

32:37.804 --> 32:39.906
and thriller movies, like
Agatha Christie, Usual Suspects,

32:39.908 --> 32:40.973
- so on and so forth.
- Right.

32:40.975 --> 32:43.675
But I'm gonna argue
that every narrator,

32:43.677 --> 32:46.779
by its very definition,
is unreliable.

32:46.781 --> 32:48.447
Because when you tell a story,

32:48.449 --> 32:49.814
there's always an
essential distance

32:49.816 --> 32:51.716
between the story
itself and the telling

32:51.718 --> 32:53.218
of said story, right?

32:53.220 --> 32:57.822
So, therefore, every story
that has ever been told

32:57.824 --> 32:59.992
has an unreliable narrator.

32:59.994 --> 33:02.028
The only truly reliable
narrator would be

33:02.030 --> 33:04.263
someone hypothetically
telling a story that unfolds

33:04.265 --> 33:06.064
before our very eyes, which
is obviously impossible.

33:06.066 --> 33:08.567
So, what does that tell us?

33:08.569 --> 33:11.236
That the only truly
reliable narrator

33:11.238 --> 33:14.339
is life itself.

33:14.341 --> 33:19.077
But life itself is also a
completely unreliable narrator

33:19.079 --> 33:21.379
because it is
constantly misdirecting

33:21.381 --> 33:23.382
and misleading us and
taking us on this journey

33:23.384 --> 33:25.551
where it is literally
impossible to predict

33:25.553 --> 33:27.386
where it's gonna go next.

33:27.388 --> 33:29.988
And that is my thesis!

33:29.990 --> 33:33.492
Life as the ultimate
unreliable narrator.

33:33.494 --> 33:36.795
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

33:36.797 --> 33:38.363
It'll make more sense when
I write it. I love you.

33:38.365 --> 33:40.632
Bye, guys.

33:40.634 --> 33:42.134
I love you.

33:42.136 --> 33:44.703
- You're up.
- I love her, Chuck.

33:44.705 --> 33:46.004
Yeah. Come on.

33:46.006 --> 33:48.440
- Holy shit.
- Your turn.

33:48.442 --> 33:51.145
I love you, Abby!

33:53.814 --> 33:55.648
Hey, before, when I
invited you over to watch

33:55.650 --> 33:56.916
Natalie Portman movies,

33:56.918 --> 33:58.684
you know I was just
being funny, right?

33:58.686 --> 34:00.552
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

34:00.554 --> 34:02.788
'Cause I'm still married, so...

34:02.790 --> 34:04.456
At least I think I am.

34:04.458 --> 34:06.457
I mean, I haven't signed
any papers or anything yet,

34:06.459 --> 34:08.960
so I don't really know
how the whole thing works.

34:08.963 --> 34:12.295
Will, it's fine. Okay?

34:12.297 --> 34:15.033
Take a deep breath.

34:15.034 --> 34:19.072
And you can tell me
about your marriage now.

34:25.378 --> 34:27.545
You want me to tell
you about my marriage?

34:27.547 --> 34:29.380
Yeah.

34:29.382 --> 34:30.882
So, you haven't, you haven't
really been listening

34:30.885 --> 34:32.784
to me, then, because...

34:32.786 --> 34:34.452
it doesn't matter what
I tell you, don't you...

34:34.454 --> 34:36.054
I don't... Why
can't you lean into this

34:36.056 --> 34:37.389
- just one fucking time?
- You see that, right?

34:37.391 --> 34:39.123
Doesn't matter what I say,
'cause I could tell you

34:39.126 --> 34:40.626
every detail about our marriage.

34:40.628 --> 34:42.092
I could tell you every detail

34:42.094 --> 34:44.495
about the day that
she left me, but...

34:44.496 --> 34:47.364
why, why would my memory
even be remotely accurate?

34:47.367 --> 34:49.135
- I'm going through a phase!
- Yeah, but why do I

34:49.137 --> 34:50.668
- have to listen...
- And I'm asking you, just...

34:50.670 --> 34:52.036
Maybe...
maybe I'd actually

34:52.039 --> 34:54.005
been smothering her for years.

34:54.007 --> 34:56.007
- No. Stop.
- Smothering her with my love

34:56.010 --> 34:58.843
and my dreams and a baby
that she wasn't ready for.

34:58.845 --> 35:00.312
Crushed him.

35:00.314 --> 35:03.215
Maybe I was just
another guy that was in her life

35:03.217 --> 35:04.850
that seemed like I
was gonna save it,

35:04.852 --> 35:06.955
but really I was just
there to ruin it.

35:09.122 --> 35:11.423
Maybe she was really
unhappy and this dream girl

35:11.425 --> 35:13.425
that I created in my
mind's eye was just like

35:13.427 --> 35:17.932
a narrative trick, to get us
through a life, you know?

35:29.075 --> 35:31.008
I mean, this is really some

35:31.010 --> 35:33.611
deep philosophical shit
we're talking about here.

35:33.613 --> 35:37.084
Yes, it is. It is.

35:40.186 --> 35:41.221
Will...

35:43.490 --> 35:47.725
we've been seeing each
other for a while now.

35:47.727 --> 35:51.796
And today, you're talking about
Abby a lot for the first time.

35:51.798 --> 35:54.466
And it's good.

35:54.468 --> 35:56.001
It's really good.

35:56.003 --> 35:59.474
So, tell me about that day.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.908
You had a nice
morning with Abby...

36:02.910 --> 36:04.943
- No, no.
- ...talking about Bob Dylan.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.079
I didn't. I didn't.
That's not what I fucking said.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.981
I just said that it may not
have been a nice morning.

36:08.983 --> 36:10.115
- Okay.
- I said that it could've been

36:10.117 --> 36:11.383
a smothering, horrible morning.

36:11.385 --> 36:14.019
Okay. It could've been a
smothering, horrible morning.

36:14.021 --> 36:17.088
You talked about Bob Dylan,

36:17.090 --> 36:19.091
then you went over to your
parents' house for lunch,

36:19.093 --> 36:21.896
and then what happened?

36:23.597 --> 36:27.099
Then she just left me.
Then she just left me.

36:27.101 --> 36:28.901
Will, she didn't
just leave you.

36:28.903 --> 36:30.839
She just left. Yes, she did.

36:33.073 --> 36:37.345
Have you seen Abby since
you've been released, Will?

36:39.046 --> 36:41.113
Come
back to me, Abby.

36:41.115 --> 36:43.314
Please come back to me.
I'll, I'll do anything.

36:43.316 --> 36:44.550
- Will?
- Just give me another chance.

36:44.552 --> 36:46.017
Will?

36:46.019 --> 36:49.887
I'm talking to my fucking wife!

36:49.889 --> 36:52.993
But your wife wasn't
there, was she?

37:01.668 --> 37:04.336
I don't know. What am I
doing? What are you doing?

37:04.338 --> 37:05.640
Will...

37:06.907 --> 37:08.974
...you're not well yet.

37:08.976 --> 37:11.776
Okay? You're mixing meds.

37:11.778 --> 37:14.248
You're, you're not yourself.

37:17.785 --> 37:20.622
Tell me about that day.

37:30.162 --> 37:32.564
We talked about Bob Dylan.

37:32.566 --> 37:34.534
Okay.

37:35.970 --> 37:38.370
We laughed.

37:38.372 --> 37:40.575
Okay.

37:43.910 --> 37:47.111
Go ahead.

37:47.113 --> 37:49.682
We almost crushed the dog.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.653
Okay.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.921
We went to my parents' house.

37:56.923 --> 37:59.126
Right.

38:01.528 --> 38:03.896
We ate meat loaf.

38:03.898 --> 38:05.798
Oh, my God, my mom's crazy.

38:05.800 --> 38:06.865
- She's totally fucking nuts.
- She is.

38:06.867 --> 38:07.999
We're never
gonna do that again.

38:08.001 --> 38:09.267
Oh, gosh.

38:09.269 --> 38:11.602
- How you feeling, my love?
- I ate too much.

38:13.206 --> 38:15.207
- You think?
- Just a little bit.

38:15.209 --> 38:17.276
You freakin' ate
the gross national

38:17.278 --> 38:19.178
meat loaf product
of a small nation.

38:19.180 --> 38:22.180
I think we might have a meat
loaf instead of a human baby.

38:22.182 --> 38:23.280
You're giving
birth to meat loaf?

38:23.282 --> 38:25.050
Yeah, we're having meat loaf.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.220
- Cab?
- No.

38:28.222 --> 38:29.354
- Walk it off?
- Yes, please.

38:29.356 --> 38:30.321
All right, let's walk it off.

38:30.323 --> 38:32.356
My heart's on fire.

38:32.358 --> 38:34.825
Not in a good way.

38:47.140 --> 38:50.276
The baby's a girl, Will.

38:50.278 --> 38:51.475
What?

38:51.477 --> 38:53.477
I know we weren't
gonna find out,

38:53.479 --> 38:57.284
but then the nurse slipped up,
and now I feel shitty knowing.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.289
In about three weeks,
you're gonna have a daughter.

39:04.590 --> 39:06.560
Say something.

39:08.561 --> 39:11.896
What?

39:11.898 --> 39:14.001
I know what you
want to name her.

39:15.970 --> 39:18.970
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:18.972 --> 39:20.604
Yeah, I think so.

39:20.606 --> 39:22.608
I know you don't like
his music, but...

39:22.610 --> 39:24.008
I love it.

39:24.010 --> 39:25.878
Big fan.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.245
I think it's cute.
I think it's...

39:32.387 --> 39:34.653
I was smothering her.
I was smothering her.

39:34.655 --> 39:36.290
That's why she left me.

39:38.258 --> 39:42.026
Will, listen, you
suffered a trauma.

39:42.028 --> 39:43.128
It was horrific.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.162
- Can you fucking help me?!
- Horrific.

39:45.164 --> 39:47.265
Help me, please!

39:47.267 --> 39:50.234
You thought
about killing yourself.

39:50.236 --> 39:54.273
You... you were in
treatment for months

39:54.275 --> 39:56.541
to keep you safe.

39:56.543 --> 39:59.111
And now you're,
you're constructing a story

39:59.113 --> 40:02.250
that somehow makes it bearable.

40:04.651 --> 40:07.720
Will... you have a baby.

40:07.722 --> 40:09.653
All right?

40:09.655 --> 40:11.258
Your baby lived.

40:12.693 --> 40:17.629
For whatever reason,
miraculously, she's alive.

40:17.631 --> 40:22.103
Now, Will, wouldn't Abby want
you to be there for that child?

40:23.537 --> 40:26.671
Now, why haven't you
gone to your parents'?

40:26.673 --> 40:28.407
Will, look at me.

40:28.409 --> 40:31.378
Why haven't you seen that baby?

40:33.313 --> 40:35.213
I think it would help you.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.283
- Okay.
- That's why you're out,

40:37.285 --> 40:39.852
and that's why you're
seeing me, to get you there.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.720
I, I think you're ready.

40:41.722 --> 40:43.424
Okay.

40:45.659 --> 40:47.524
I'm gonna go.

40:47.526 --> 40:49.461
No, hang on, Will.
Will, hang on.

40:49.463 --> 40:51.396
No, I don't want you
to leave yet. Let's...

40:51.398 --> 40:53.432
That's not the right story. No.

40:53.434 --> 40:55.399
I'm not really the
hero of the story.

40:55.401 --> 40:57.301
This is, trauma
is vicious, Will.

40:57.303 --> 40:59.637
I'm sorry. You're very nice.

40:59.639 --> 41:01.506
You're very nice.

41:01.508 --> 41:03.408
I don't want to
be here anymore.

41:03.410 --> 41:05.042
Look, just sit
down. We can...

41:05.044 --> 41:06.477
Let me talk you
through this.

the grossest

42:03.470 --> 42:05.738
and also a little bit douchey.

42:05.740 --> 42:08.407
She was literally born
of death and tragedy.

42:09.977 --> 42:11.776
Six months into

42:11.778 --> 42:13.945
her father started
locking in the pattern.

42:15.381 --> 42:17.284

How you feeling, kiddo?

43:16.376 --> 43:19.343
I feel like my whole
life is gonna be

43:19.345 --> 43:22.814
marked by death and tragedy.

43:22.816 --> 43:24.850
She did not
say this, of course,

43:24.852 --> 43:26.818
but if she could verbalize
what she was feeling

43:26.820 --> 43:28.922
at eight years old,
she would've.

43:32.693 --> 43:35.359
I crave a happy life, Grandpa.

43:35.361 --> 43:37.695
I have a almost
desperate craving

43:37.697 --> 43:40.198
for stability and happiness,

43:40.200 --> 43:42.166
the way fat people
crave chocolate

43:42.168 --> 43:44.436
or lost hikers crave rescue.

43:44.438 --> 43:48.372
I want to live a big,
great, fantastical life,

43:48.374 --> 43:50.209
but I'm concerned that

43:50.211 --> 43:52.443
the tragedy
that seems to follow me,

43:52.445 --> 43:54.379
the tragedy that birthed me

43:54.381 --> 43:56.847
will prevent that
from ever happening.

43:56.849 --> 43:59.017
And I don't know
if I can withstand

43:59.019 --> 44:00.888
another body blow like this.

44:02.021 --> 44:04.455
But what she really said was...

44:04.457 --> 44:07.225
How you feeling, kiddo?

44:07.227 --> 44:10.095
Are you gonna die, Grandpa?

44:10.097 --> 44:13.633
Yes. I am.

44:15.802 --> 44:19.137
Probably sooner than
you'd like, kiddo...

44:19.139 --> 44:21.071
if I'm being honest.

44:21.073 --> 44:24.075
I'm gonna fight like hell
to stick around for you

44:24.077 --> 44:28.280
as long as possible,
to prevent one more death

44:28.282 --> 44:31.515
from coming anywhere
near your doorstep.

44:31.517 --> 44:33.417
I'm gonna get on
the fucking treadmill,

44:33.419 --> 44:36.588
cut back on the red meat.

44:36.590 --> 44:38.457
I'm gonna do my best.

44:38.459 --> 44:40.490
Get you through
your teenage years

44:40.492 --> 44:44.562
without losing
one more goddamn thing.

44:44.564 --> 44:47.532
Gonna do it for
your mother and father.

44:47.534 --> 44:50.102
I'm gonna do it
for your grandmother.

44:50.104 --> 44:53.441
Most of all, I'm gonna do
it for you, granddaughter.

44:55.175 --> 44:57.843
I'm gonna squeeze
out ten more years

44:57.845 --> 45:02.213
from this decrepit old body,
for you, my girl.

45:02.215 --> 45:04.883
My angel.

45:04.885 --> 45:07.251
Again, Irwin
expressed this all with...

45:07.253 --> 45:10.357
No. No more dying
around here, kiddo.

45:14.595 --> 45:18.399
- Okay?
- Okay.

45:28.041 --> 45:31.575
The Dylan Dempsey
transformation years.

45:31.577 --> 45:33.510
The years brought puberty.

45:33.512 --> 45:36.013
Puberty brought sexuality.

45:36.015 --> 45:41.186
Sexuality brought anger
and fear and confusion.

45:41.188 --> 45:42.954
And when the smoke cleared,

45:42.956 --> 45:45.557
where that sweet
little girl once stood,

45:45.559 --> 45:47.158
there remained only a woman

45:47.160 --> 45:50.896
who scared the absolute
shit out of everyone.

45:50.898 --> 45:55.934
♪ You took a part of me
that I really miss ♪

45:55.936 --> 46:01.573
♪ I keep asking myself how long
it can go on like this ♪

46:01.575 --> 46:04.675
♪ You told yourself a lie ♪

46:04.677 --> 46:07.781
♪ That's all right, mama,
I told myself one, too... ♪

46:11.718 --> 46:14.318
Come in.

46:14.320 --> 46:16.387
♪ Still a million
miles from you. ♪

46:16.389 --> 46:18.523
Hey.

46:18.525 --> 46:21.024
Hey. I'm going out.

46:21.026 --> 46:22.459
With who?

46:22.461 --> 46:25.262
Just with some friends.

46:25.264 --> 46:27.664
Cigarettes.

46:27.666 --> 46:29.767
Grandma used to say
it's a nasty habit

46:29.769 --> 46:33.338
of people lighting little
fires under their noses.

46:33.340 --> 46:35.640
Cool.

46:35.642 --> 46:39.778
You aren't even gonna try
and hide them from me?

46:39.780 --> 46:42.379
Aren't we both
better than that?

46:42.381 --> 46:44.481
I don't know.

46:44.483 --> 46:46.751
You hear Vermont's
made them illegal?

46:46.753 --> 46:49.023
Remind me never
to go to Vermont.

46:54.093 --> 46:56.327
- Can I have one?
- No.

46:56.329 --> 46:59.231
Just one?

46:59.233 --> 47:01.168
No, these things will kill you.

47:07.106 --> 47:09.908
Was hoping we could
talk about college.

47:09.910 --> 47:13.410
We talked about it last night.

47:13.412 --> 47:15.247
- Didn't get very far.
- Yes, we did.

47:15.249 --> 47:18.582
We just didn't get
where you wanted it to go.

47:18.584 --> 47:20.986
I'm 21, Irwin.
Give up on the dream.

47:20.988 --> 47:23.421
I've almost saved enough
to get out of your hair.

47:23.423 --> 47:25.557
I promise.

47:25.559 --> 47:27.557
Promise you'll
be home by 11:00?

47:27.559 --> 47:29.494
I'd rather not lie to you.

47:29.496 --> 47:32.233
- Please lie to me.
- I'll be home by 11:00.

47:34.066 --> 47:36.070
Dylan.

47:39.706 --> 47:42.709
Happy 21st, kiddo.

47:55.956 --> 47:57.588
Some sugar.

47:57.590 --> 47:58.958
Mwah.

48:03.162 --> 48:05.131
Peace!

48:54.680 --> 48:56.715
Hey.
Hey, everyone.

48:56.717 --> 48:59.015
We're PB&J.

48:59.017 --> 49:01.419
Yeah!

49:01.421 --> 49:03.954
Um...

49:03.956 --> 49:06.725
Uh, this first song
is kind of personal.

49:06.727 --> 49:08.059
Um...

49:08.061 --> 49:10.729
My mom died
21 years ago today, and...

49:10.731 --> 49:12.363
Take it off!

49:17.738 --> 49:19.870
They tell me she used
to listen to Bob Dylan.

49:19.872 --> 49:22.106
Show us your tits!

49:28.447 --> 49:30.881
Whatever.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.253
Hey!

51:15.255 --> 51:16.789
What the fuck?

51:21.128 --> 51:22.794
Hey!

51:22.796 --> 51:25.899
Hey, you owe me
a new phone, bitch.

51:27.666 --> 51:29.533
Yeah. You're right, I'm sorry.

51:29.535 --> 51:32.169
That, uh...
I shouldn't have done that.

51:32.171 --> 51:34.372
Uh, it's just been
a really weird day for me.

51:34.374 --> 51:36.541
Um...

51:36.543 --> 51:39.276
Let me see what I have on me.
Can you hold that a second?

51:39.278 --> 51:40.778
I'm so, so sorry.

51:45.385 --> 51:47.521
You think that's funny?
You fucking filming me?!

51:49.756 --> 51:51.756
Dylan!

51:51.758 --> 51:53.390
I'm fine. I'm fine!

51:53.392 --> 51:54.725
I'm fine.

52:50.249 --> 52:52.749
The baby's a girl, Will.

52:52.751 --> 52:54.885
What?

52:54.887 --> 52:57.120
I know we weren't
gonna find out,

52:57.122 --> 53:01.191
but then the nurse slipped up,
and now I feel shitty knowing.

53:01.193 --> 53:05.162
In about three weeks,
you're gonna have a daughter.

53:05.164 --> 53:07.231
Actually, Daddy's gonna
blow his brains out

53:07.233 --> 53:09.566
before he even meets me, so...

53:09.568 --> 53:11.202
Say something.

53:11.204 --> 53:13.070
I know what you
want to name her.

53:13.072 --> 53:14.771
I know you don't
like his music...

53:14.773 --> 53:16.341
Might want to look
to your right, lady.

53:16.343 --> 53:17.341
I love it.

53:17.343 --> 53:19.376
- Big fan.
- Mom.

53:19.378 --> 53:21.879
- I think it's pretty cute.
- I think it's gonna be...

53:21.881 --> 53:24.017
Mom, Mom, look out!

53:43.669 --> 53:46.606
Are you okay?

53:49.108 --> 53:51.277
Does it matter?

53:53.012 --> 53:54.845
If Rodrigo Gonzalez

53:54.847 --> 53:56.981
had really been
there that night,

53:56.983 --> 53:58.816
he might have told
the stoned young woman

53:58.818 --> 54:01.151
sitting in front of him that
it mattered quite a bit to him

54:01.153 --> 54:04.291
that Dylan Dempsey was okay.

55:03.082 --> 55:05.082
Bueno. Bueno. Hombre.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.218
- No, sir.
- No, right.

57:10.043 --> 57:11.311
No, señor.

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:11.084
Ay, ay ay.

01:06:26.932 --> 01:06:28.899
At exactly this moment,

01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:30.934
a mere 4,000 miles away,

01:06:30.936 --> 01:06:33.070
Abby Dempsey,
then Abby Lesher,

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:36.539
had just finished the first
draft of her college thesis.

01:06:36.541 --> 01:06:38.209
"But life
itself proves to be

01:06:38.211 --> 01:06:40.410
"the most unreliable
of narrators,

01:06:40.412 --> 01:06:41.778
"forever taking us
on a journey

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.812
"where it is impossible
to predict

01:06:42.814 --> 01:06:45.249
what might happen next.
Life its..."

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.117
Okay. This next part gets a
little flowery...

01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:48.151
Read, woman.

01:06:48.153 --> 01:06:49.787
I know, but I feel
like it's getting away

01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:51.254
- from literary crit...
- Read!

01:06:51.256 --> 01:06:52.856
Life itself tricks us.

01:06:52.858 --> 01:06:54.524
It misleads us.

01:06:54.526 --> 01:06:58.260
It paints one man a hero
when he may well be a villain.

01:06:58.262 --> 01:07:00.097
Hero or villain?

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:03.533
Villain or hero?

01:07:03.535 --> 01:07:04.434
Or maybe neither.

01:07:04.436 --> 01:07:05.635
Maybe life is playing the role

01:07:05.637 --> 01:07:08.271
of unreliable trickster
yet again.

01:07:08.273 --> 01:07:09.372
Maybe those it paints

01:07:09.374 --> 01:07:11.474
as the heroes and
villains of our stories

01:07:11.476 --> 01:07:14.644
are actually just day players
in a much bigger movie.

01:07:14.646 --> 01:07:16.178
Maybe they're simply extras,

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.983
filling the frames
so the real heroes

01:07:18.985 --> 01:07:21.421
can have bodies
crossing in the background.

01:07:23.356 --> 01:07:26.021
And then it sort of says
that over and over again...

01:07:26.023 --> 01:07:28.559
You...

01:07:28.561 --> 01:07:30.794
...are so much smarter than me.

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:34.463
I really am, aren't I?

01:07:36.869 --> 01:07:39.704
Abby's thesis
was a total disaster.

01:07:39.706 --> 01:07:42.439
Her favorite and
most trusted professor argued,

01:07:42.441 --> 01:07:44.307
as she feared he might,

01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:46.276
that she had strayed
from literary criticism

01:07:46.278 --> 01:07:48.345
and had veered into
an unwieldy cross

01:07:48.347 --> 01:07:52.916
of creative writing and
17th-century French philosophy.

01:07:52.918 --> 01:07:55.452
Then Abby's favorite
and most trusted professor

01:07:55.454 --> 01:07:57.254
tried to fuck her.

01:07:57.256 --> 01:08:00.691
Which, one might argue,
proved Abby's thesis after all.

01:08:09.501 --> 01:08:11.233
A continent away,

01:08:11.235 --> 01:08:14.439
Javier González was
worried about none of this.

01:08:16.774 --> 01:08:19.341
Javier González
didn't philosophize

01:08:19.344 --> 01:08:23.312
and he never wondered
what life had in store for him.

01:08:23.314 --> 01:08:26.350
Javier González knew
where he was going.

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:28.519
He'd known all along.

01:08:36.728 --> 01:08:38.294
Oh.

01:08:44.435 --> 01:08:46.903
Isabel Diaz
had been taught from birth

01:08:46.904 --> 01:08:49.004
to expect a very average life.

01:08:49.006 --> 01:08:51.041
She was one of six sisters

01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:53.408
and was openly considered
to be the fourth prettiest.

01:09:05.624 --> 01:09:07.160
Bravo.

01:09:17.768 --> 01:09:19.069
Ooh.

01:10:12.924 --> 01:10:14.193
No, no.

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.773
Una...

01:10:29.775 --> 01:10:31.173
Dos...

01:10:31.175 --> 01:10:33.877
- Y...
- Y tres!

01:12:01.332 --> 01:12:02.601
America.

01:12:08.005 --> 01:12:09.806
Isabel could
no longer remember

01:12:09.808 --> 01:12:12.876
when Mr. Saccione first started
coming over to visit Rodrigo.

01:12:14.513 --> 01:12:17.881
She only knew that the visits
had become more consistent,

01:12:17.883 --> 01:12:19.548
usually in the
middle of the day,

01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:21.987
always when Javier
was in the fields.

01:12:37.268 --> 01:12:38.536
- Si, si.
- No, no, no.

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.795
No!

01:14:32.451 --> 01:14:34.550
Javier González
was a simple man,

01:14:34.552 --> 01:14:36.485
but not a stupid one.

01:14:36.487 --> 01:14:38.989
And that day,
he began doing something

01:14:38.991 --> 01:14:43.459
he'd never done before:
planning a family vacation.

01:14:43.461 --> 01:14:45.560
To a place that
he had just learned

01:14:45.562 --> 01:14:49.501
his son desperately wanted
to visit with someone else.

01:15:31.543 --> 01:15:33.944
- Hello.
- Hola.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.145
- Hola.
- Hola.

01:15:35.147 --> 01:15:36.913
Hola. Hola.

01:15:36.915 --> 01:15:38.551
Hey, little guy. Look.

01:15:40.418 --> 01:15:42.918
Where'd it go? Look.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.419
- Whoa.
- There it is.

01:15:44.421 --> 01:15:45.758
Where are you from?

01:16:08.414 --> 01:16:10.849
A pregnant woman
eviscerated by a bus.

01:16:13.284 --> 01:16:15.985
A grown man
weeping desperately.

01:16:15.987 --> 01:16:17.889
Bystanders screaming.

01:16:19.823 --> 01:16:22.358
It was only about
20 seconds of footage,

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.427
but it would replay on a loop

01:16:24.429 --> 01:16:27.900
in little Rodrigo González's
brain for years to come.

01:16:32.137 --> 01:16:33.906
Mamá!

01:17:26.124 --> 01:17:27.293
Rigo!

01:17:40.304 --> 01:17:41.404
Mamá!

01:17:53.918 --> 01:17:55.487
- No!
- Rigo.

01:19:51.402 --> 01:19:52.036
Hm-mm.

01:20:32.509 --> 01:20:34.976
Months passed.

01:20:34.978 --> 01:20:37.846
Mr. Saccione's visits
were no longer restricted.

01:20:37.848 --> 01:20:39.715
His gifts no longer withheld.

01:20:39.717 --> 01:20:42.319
Wow.

01:20:42.321 --> 01:20:43.752
Ooh. Hola, Oli.

01:20:43.754 --> 01:20:47.355
And now,
in English.

01:20:47.357 --> 01:20:49.025
My name is...

01:20:49.027 --> 01:20:51.127
Rodrigo...

01:20:51.129 --> 01:20:51.796
González.

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.932
But I like to be called Rod.

01:20:56.934 --> 01:20:59.635
- Or Rigo.
- Yeah.

01:20:59.637 --> 01:21:00.903
Oh.

01:21:00.905 --> 01:21:02.739
I am from Spain.

01:21:02.741 --> 01:21:04.273
Keep going.

01:21:04.275 --> 01:21:06.641
I was sad

01:21:06.643 --> 01:21:09.378
for a long time.

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.448
But my uncle got me a bird,

01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:15.187
which helps.

01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:12.991
Hola.

01:27:07.237 --> 01:27:09.038
If we've
learned anything by now,

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.474
it's not to get attached
to new heroes.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:13.208
They tend to disappoint.

01:27:14.778 --> 01:27:17.079
But damn if little
Rodrigo González

01:27:17.081 --> 01:27:20.016
didn't look like
the real deal.

01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:33.457
Rodrigo...

01:29:16.666 --> 01:29:18.236
Ay, ay, ay!

01:29:44.394 --> 01:29:45.729
Rigo.

01:31:12.415 --> 01:31:15.050
Rodrigo entered
college a visiting freshman,

01:31:15.052 --> 01:31:18.087
and as he'd been doing for
most of the previous decade,

01:31:18.089 --> 01:31:19.890
he thrived.

01:31:21.424 --> 01:31:24.627
He lettered in two sports.

01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:25.961
...proportional to the ratio...

01:31:25.963 --> 01:31:29.166
His marks were
at the very top of his class.

01:31:31.035 --> 01:31:33.235
He even embarked
on a relationship

01:31:33.237 --> 01:31:35.738
with a 20-something
from Long Island

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:37.308
named Shari Dickstein.

01:31:43.613 --> 01:31:47.416
She made him laugh...
usually not intentionally.

01:31:47.418 --> 01:31:50.019
Oh, my God. You've never
been to Whole Foods?

01:31:50.021 --> 01:31:51.653
- No. But what is that?
- Okay, I'll take you there.

01:31:51.655 --> 01:31:53.788
It's like a dream.
It's like a...

01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:56.425
She wasn't his great
love, but she was company.

01:31:56.427 --> 01:31:58.961
And great love wasn't
his priority at the moment.

01:31:58.963 --> 01:32:01.462
...clean eating, vegan dream.

01:32:01.464 --> 01:32:03.097
What's-what's vegan?

01:32:03.099 --> 01:32:04.467
Oh, my God, you're adorable.

01:32:04.469 --> 01:32:06.437
I love that
you don't know things.

01:32:07.972 --> 01:32:09.805
He saved every dollar,

01:32:09.807 --> 01:32:11.507
coveted every vacation.

01:32:11.509 --> 01:32:14.510
Rodrigo González
had an internal compass,

01:32:14.512 --> 01:32:16.347
and it always pointed
in the same direction.

01:32:19.717 --> 01:32:22.353
- En Nueva York?
- Si.

01:32:29.927 --> 01:32:30.891
- Shari?
- Shari.

01:32:30.893 --> 01:32:31.927
Shari Distin.

01:32:31.929 --> 01:32:32.931
Shari Dickstein.

01:32:42.839 --> 01:32:44.472
- No.
- Si. Si, si, si.

01:32:44.474 --> 01:32:46.609
Like so many of
the biggest years of our lives,

01:32:46.611 --> 01:32:47.876
it flew by.

01:32:47.878 --> 01:32:50.878
But in truth,
that year was just a setup,

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:55.851
a preamble to the biggest day
of Rodrigo González's life.

01:33:11.067 --> 01:33:14.136
Where are you going?

01:33:14.138 --> 01:33:17.373
I'm just going for a quick run.

01:33:17.375 --> 01:33:19.940
- Miarma.
- Huh?

01:33:19.942 --> 01:33:24.279
When we first started dating,
you used to call me "Miarma."

01:33:24.281 --> 01:33:26.181
You would've said,

01:33:26.183 --> 01:33:29.051
"Just going for
a quick run, Miarma."

01:33:29.053 --> 01:33:32.756
It always made me feel like
Kelly Ripa.

01:33:35.293 --> 01:33:36.858
Shari...

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.696
I'm pregnant.

01:33:39.664 --> 01:33:43.298
I know. Obvi,
lots to talk about.

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:45.833
Hey, will you
take me for brunch?

01:33:45.835 --> 01:33:48.270
There's this place
I really want to try.

01:33:48.272 --> 01:33:49.770
It's Vietnamese,
which I'm assuming

01:33:49.772 --> 01:33:52.041
is kind of like
dim sum or something.

01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:54.877
We can talk at brunch,
at the Vietnamese place.

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:56.546
I really want to try it.

01:33:58.950 --> 01:34:01.382
So, I just started feeling
shitty a few weeks ago.

01:34:01.384 --> 01:34:03.452
I thought I was just getting
a really bad period.

01:34:03.454 --> 01:34:04.919
Ever since I got off the pill,

01:34:04.921 --> 01:34:07.523
I have been having
bananas periods, you know?

01:34:07.525 --> 01:34:10.258
But it wasn't stopping,
so I went to my gyno,

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:12.560
and he was like,
"Are you sexually active?"

01:34:12.562 --> 01:34:13.962
So I told him about you,

01:34:13.964 --> 01:34:16.664
and then he did the
test thing and blammo!

01:34:16.666 --> 01:34:18.867
I hadn't even thought
to try an at-home test.

01:34:18.869 --> 01:34:20.302
For whatever reason,

01:34:20.304 --> 01:34:22.570
my brain did not go there
whatso-fucking-ever.

01:34:22.572 --> 01:34:25.039
Anyways, I know that we haven't
been together very long,

01:34:25.041 --> 01:34:27.842
and clearly this is as
"what the fuck" as things get.

01:34:27.844 --> 01:34:30.278
I mean, I don't know what your
deal is with religious stuff,

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:35.950
but I'm thinking that I should
probably just get an abortion.

01:34:35.952 --> 01:34:38.787
Are you, like, are you, like,
super against that? Abortion?

01:34:38.789 --> 01:34:41.088
I know abortion's a really
big deal for Christians.

01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:44.426
There should, like, be,
like, a pill or something

01:34:44.428 --> 01:34:46.528
for something like this,
like, unplanned pregnancy.

01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:47.928
'Cause if you're
Christian, I'm...

01:34:49.799 --> 01:34:51.632
Anyhow, we don't have to
decide any of this right now,

01:34:51.634 --> 01:34:53.235
but I would like
to make the call early,

01:34:53.237 --> 01:34:54.535
just before
the thing has, like,

01:34:54.537 --> 01:34:55.971
a head and stuff, you know?

01:34:55.973 --> 01:34:57.642
Oh, hey, there we are!

01:35:05.215 --> 01:35:09.583
So, the way I see it,
we have, like, three options.

01:35:09.585 --> 01:35:11.453
Option one: we have it.

01:35:11.455 --> 01:35:12.954
I mean, a mixed-race baby

01:35:12.956 --> 01:35:15.090
with our skin complexions
would be amazeballs.

01:35:15.092 --> 01:35:17.426
My family have batshit money,

01:35:17.428 --> 01:35:20.694
so we could get
nannies and stuff.

01:35:20.696 --> 01:35:22.898
I don't know,
it's probably a bad idea.

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:25.633
Option two: abort.
But again, I would like to make

01:35:25.635 --> 01:35:27.569
that call sooner
rather than later.

01:35:27.571 --> 01:35:31.340
Or option three:
we can just both agree

01:35:31.342 --> 01:35:34.775
that this is all
an insane April Fools' joke!

01:35:34.777 --> 01:35:35.780
Ah!

01:35:37.147 --> 01:35:39.079
What?

01:35:39.081 --> 01:35:41.382
April Fools', bitch!

01:35:41.384 --> 01:35:43.450
Wh-What is that?

01:35:43.452 --> 01:35:45.220
Seriously?
You don't know April Fools'?

01:35:45.222 --> 01:35:47.521
No, I don't.

01:35:47.523 --> 01:35:50.958
Well, I didn't know that.

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.260
So there is no baby?

01:35:52.262 --> 01:35:54.229
Dude! Ew, no.

01:35:54.231 --> 01:35:56.931
Of course not.

01:35:56.933 --> 01:35:58.667
Oh, come on.

01:35:58.669 --> 01:36:01.503
You have to admit, that was,
that was pretty funny.

01:36:03.874 --> 01:36:05.576
Shari...

01:36:08.378 --> 01:36:10.014
Oh, fuck.

01:36:12.549 --> 01:36:14.283
You're gonna break up
with me, aren't you?

01:36:14.285 --> 01:36:16.351
He was.

01:36:16.353 --> 01:36:17.852
Yes, I am.
I'm-I'm sorry...

01:36:17.854 --> 01:36:19.553
Obviously,
nothing thus far

01:36:19.555 --> 01:36:20.922
had indicated
that this would be

01:36:20.924 --> 01:36:23.458
the most important day
of Rodrigo's life.

01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:25.159
No.

01:36:25.161 --> 01:36:28.462
Sometimes the most important
days of our lives begin,

01:36:28.464 --> 01:36:30.398
and we're not even
there to see it.

01:37:07.304 --> 01:37:07.839
Isabel.

01:37:40.137 --> 01:37:41.104
No.

01:38:01.592 --> 01:38:03.561
Hola, Bella.

01:38:12.236 --> 01:38:14.802
Mr. Saccione
was a letter writer.

01:38:14.804 --> 01:38:16.904
He always had been.

01:38:16.906 --> 01:38:19.608
He believed in the power
of the written word,

01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:21.409
the force of
actually sitting down

01:38:21.411 --> 01:38:23.080
and writing
to someone by hand.

01:38:49.106 --> 01:38:51.405
And with that,
Mr. Saccione's letters

01:38:51.407 --> 01:38:54.775
found a new recipient.

01:38:54.777 --> 01:38:57.346
A man whose only request
was that he be kept up to date

01:38:57.348 --> 01:38:58.783
on those he had abandoned
but still cherished.

01:39:38.488 --> 01:39:40.124
Hola, Bella.

01:40:02.278 --> 01:40:04.014
Hola.

01:40:05.014 --> 01:40:07.115
Hola.

01:41:52.789 --> 01:41:56.091
When critics reviewed
Abby Dempsey's favorite album,

01:41:56.093 --> 01:41:59.895
Bob Dylan's 1997 release,
"Time Out of Mind,"

01:41:59.897 --> 01:42:01.762
the song
"Make You Feel My Love"

01:42:01.764 --> 01:42:03.664
was a source
of much criticism.

01:42:08.671 --> 01:42:10.504
Every track on the album

01:42:10.506 --> 01:42:14.010
brimmed with unrelenting
melancholy and sadness.

01:42:15.946 --> 01:42:19.114
But there,
smack in the middle of it all,

01:42:19.116 --> 01:42:22.382
sat an unabashedly
populist hit song,

01:42:22.384 --> 01:42:24.151
a love song...

01:42:24.153 --> 01:42:26.521
a song that in years
to come would be covered

01:42:26.523 --> 01:42:29.992
by Garth Brooks, of all people.

01:42:29.994 --> 01:42:32.526
Critics argued that putting
an on-the-nose love song

01:42:32.528 --> 01:42:35.529
in the middle of an album
about despair and tragedy

01:42:35.531 --> 01:42:38.365
was Dylan's only misstep.

01:42:38.367 --> 01:42:41.569
Others argued
that it was his point.

01:42:41.571 --> 01:42:43.437
Are you okay?

01:42:54.518 --> 01:42:57.454
Hola.

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.927
My father,
Rodrigo González,

01:43:06.929 --> 01:43:10.765
officially met my mother,
Dylan Dempsey, that day...

01:43:10.767 --> 01:43:13.133
the most important
day of his life.

01:43:13.135 --> 01:43:14.970
Hi.

01:43:14.972 --> 01:43:18.440
They would not
spend a single night apart

01:43:18.442 --> 01:43:21.409
for the next 42 years.

01:43:21.411 --> 01:43:24.078
They would go on
to have four children,

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:28.082
seven grandchildren.

01:43:28.084 --> 01:43:31.752
A love story for the ages.

01:43:31.754 --> 01:43:34.021
My grandmother, Abby Dempsey,

01:43:34.023 --> 01:43:36.623
argued in her
failed college thesis

01:43:36.625 --> 01:43:42.530
that life itself is our
most unreliable narrator.

01:43:42.532 --> 01:43:47.034
She argued that no one knows
where their story is going,

01:43:47.036 --> 01:43:50.307
nor who the heroes
in it are going to be.

01:43:52.509 --> 01:43:56.310
And while it's true that life
has often made it difficult

01:43:56.312 --> 01:43:58.812
to pinpoint the heroes
of my family's story,

01:43:58.814 --> 01:44:04.088
my parents have always made
it incredibly easy for me.

01:44:05.821 --> 01:44:08.190
They found the one
populist love song

01:44:08.192 --> 01:44:12.026
in our family's often
very melancholy album.

01:44:12.028 --> 01:44:14.127
Unlike my grandmother Abby,

01:44:14.129 --> 01:44:17.399
my grandmother Isabel
was neither a writer

01:44:17.401 --> 01:44:19.301
nor a philosopher.

01:44:19.303 --> 01:44:21.935
But sometimes I wonder
if she didn't understand

01:44:21.937 --> 01:44:23.837
exactly what Bob Dylan
was going for.

01:44:26.876 --> 01:44:29.976
Spanish does not often
translate perfectly,

01:44:29.978 --> 01:44:31.745
but what Isabel said
to my father

01:44:31.747 --> 01:44:35.882
the day she sent him away,
it required no translation.

01:44:35.884 --> 01:44:37.921
Mamá...

01:44:40.889 --> 01:44:43.192
Enough.

01:44:45.594 --> 01:44:47.428
Listen to me.

01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:53.434
Rigo, you have had many
ups and downs in your life.

01:44:53.436 --> 01:44:56.072
Too many.

01:44:57.941 --> 01:45:00.941
And you will have more.

01:45:00.943 --> 01:45:03.310
This is life.

01:45:03.312 --> 01:45:06.980
And this is what it does.

01:45:06.982 --> 01:45:10.217
Life brings you to your knees.

01:45:13.156 --> 01:45:18.062
It brings you lower
than you think you can go.

01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:24.798
But if you stand back up...

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:29.436
and move forward...

01:45:29.438 --> 01:45:35.075
if you go just
a little farther...

01:45:35.077 --> 01:45:38.615
you will always find love.

01:45:44.853 --> 01:45:48.391
I found love in you.

01:45:50.626 --> 01:45:54.462
And my life, my story,

01:45:54.464 --> 01:45:58.632
it will continue
after I'm gone.

01:45:58.634 --> 01:46:01.637
Because you are my story.

01:46:05.375 --> 01:46:09.209
You are your father's story.

01:46:09.211 --> 01:46:12.814
Your uncle's.

01:46:16.152 --> 01:46:22.090
Rigo, my body fails me.

01:46:22.092 --> 01:46:25.062
But you are me.

01:46:29.965 --> 01:46:31.833
So you go now.

01:46:34.670 --> 01:46:39.907
Give me a beautiful life.

01:46:39.909 --> 01:46:43.043
The most beautiful life ever.

01:46:43.045 --> 01:46:45.249
Yeah?

01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:51.321
And if life brings
us to our knees...

01:46:54.758 --> 01:46:57.760
you stand us back up.

01:47:01.464 --> 01:47:04.865
You get up.

01:47:04.867 --> 01:47:07.571
And go farther.

01:47:11.775 --> 01:47:15.176
And find us the love.

01:47:15.178 --> 01:47:17.648
Will you do that?

01:47:34.531 --> 01:47:38.099
I'm not sure whose
story I have been telling.

01:47:38.101 --> 01:47:40.868
I'm not sure if it is mine,

01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:43.439
or if it's some character's
I have yet to meet.

01:47:45.741 --> 01:47:47.943
I'm not sure of anything.

01:47:47.945 --> 01:47:52.079
All I know is that,
at any moment,

01:47:52.081 --> 01:47:55.283
life will surprise me.

01:47:55.285 --> 01:47:59.887
It will bring me to my knees.

01:47:59.889 --> 01:48:01.823
And when it does,

01:48:01.825 --> 01:48:03.126
I will remind myself...

01:48:04.826 --> 01:48:06.694
I will remind myself

01:48:06.696 --> 01:48:09.800
that I am my father.

01:48:12.434 --> 01:48:16.003
And I am my father's father.

01:48:16.005 --> 01:48:18.840
I am my mother.

01:48:18.842 --> 01:48:21.109
And I am my mother's mother.

01:48:24.915 --> 01:48:26.379
And while it may be easy

01:48:26.381 --> 01:48:30.051
to wallow in the tragedies
that shape our lives,

01:48:30.053 --> 01:48:32.886
and while it's natural
to focus on those

01:48:32.888 --> 01:48:38.258
unspeakable moments
that bring us to our knees,

01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:39.860
we must remind ourselves

01:48:39.862 --> 01:48:42.329
that if we get up,

01:48:42.331 --> 01:48:45.568
if we take the story
a little bit farther...

01:48:56.411 --> 01:49:00.047
If we go far enough,

01:49:00.049 --> 01:49:01.752
there's love.

01:49:05.955 --> 01:49:07.221
Hey.

01:49:09.625 --> 01:49:11.693
Hey.

01:49:11.695 --> 01:49:14.495
Goddamn.
