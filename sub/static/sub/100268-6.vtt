[mellow electronic music plays]

00:33.575 --> 00:36.786
Hey, easy! We’re moving out,
not robbing the joint!

00:40.540 --> 00:41.374
[gasps]

00:42.250 --> 00:45.211
You wanted me to tell you
when the team arrived.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.547
-Hey, what’s going on?!
-[music fades]

00:47.881 --> 00:48.757
They're here.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.592
She’s robbing the joint!

00:51.092 --> 00:56.055
We’re not robbing anything! I paid for
all of this! And the operation is over.

00:57.515 --> 00:58.975
Hey! [gasps]

00:59.059 --> 01:01.936
Aww! You’re taking the nacho dispenser?

01:02.020 --> 01:03.688
[sobs, whimpers]

01:03.772 --> 01:06.524
I’m afraid this is "nacho" cheese anymore .

01:06.608 --> 01:09.778
[Ms. Nowhere sniggers] It's funny, Gary!

01:09.861 --> 01:12.864
Easy, big guy. Never let 'em see you cry.

01:13.531 --> 01:17.160
Why are you pulling the plug?
We know the cars are the keys!

01:17.243 --> 01:21.164
Yeah, and Frostee’s been captured!
He’s still out there!

01:21.247 --> 01:26.211
This is why I wanted to leave before
they returned. I always have to explain.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.673
Congratulations, you found out
that the cars were the keys.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.634
What do you want, a cookie?

01:32.717 --> 01:33.635
Well, too bad!

01:33.718 --> 01:38.264
Because you also blew your cover and,
yes, I know Frostee’s still out there!

01:38.348 --> 01:42.185
And who’s gotta bring him home to his moms
and clean up your mess?

01:42.268 --> 01:46.064
I do! And I hate cleaning.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.778
I’m really sorry about Frostee,
but it was great meeting you all.

01:51.861 --> 01:56.407
-I hope we can spy together in the future.
-[Ms. Nowhere] Gary! Hauler! Now!

01:57.659 --> 01:59.536
Yo, not the cars, too.

01:59.619 --> 02:04.165
Yes, the cars. Those upgrades
are property of the US government.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.836
We’ll be sure to ship them back
after we remove the spy gear.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.796
Also, we don’t cover shipping.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.091
[panting]

[engine revs]

02:23.101 --> 02:25.019
Okay, good, I found you!

02:25.103 --> 02:27.730
-Layla...
-I can’t believe you took Frostee!

02:27.981 --> 02:31.234
I didn’t know that would happen!
You gotta believe me!

02:31.609 --> 02:33.069
-I don’t.
-Me neither.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.365
Shashi crossed a line taking him.
I ditched them the first chance I got.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.701
Why didn’t you get Frostee out?

02:40.285 --> 02:41.119
I couldn’t...

02:41.494 --> 02:44.873
And you came here to apologize?
Sounds suspicious to me.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.959
I didn’t come to apologize,
I came to warn you.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.085
About what?

02:49.169 --> 02:52.130
-I know what the cars unlock.
-What did you say?

02:52.547 --> 02:57.802
Together the five cars open a vault and
inside is something called Skeleton Key.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.430
Please! Take her.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.390
[Layla] Wait!

03:02.974 --> 03:04.976
[grunts] You have to listen to me!

03:05.059 --> 03:07.937
[Ms. Nowhere] It’s too early
for a bedtime story.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.023
What? You’ve heard of this thing?

03:10.440 --> 03:15.778
Supposedly Skeleton Key can control any
technology within a several-mile radius.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.113
But it’s just a myth.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.532
It’s real! No, think about it.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.994
Those billionaires had access
to top minds and money.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.372
They created it.
Skeleton Key exists. [grunts]

03:26.456 --> 03:29.709
A device that controls technology?
Doesn’t sound so bad.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.879
Bad doesn’t come close
to the apocalyptic catastrophe

03:32.962 --> 03:34.839
the Skeleton Key could unleash.

03:35.882 --> 03:40.178
[Gary]  A person with that power could
lead armies with the wave of a hand.

03:40.261 --> 03:45.099
They could rain down fiery vengeance
on anyone from anywhere at anytime.

03:45.850 --> 03:50.521
Skeleton Key could turn a mere mortal
into an all-powerful god!

03:53.650 --> 03:56.152
Okay, melodramatic much?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.654
I think they get it.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.365
If Skeleton Key exists
and the cars unlock it

04:00.448 --> 04:02.533
then there’s only one thing to do:

04:02.617 --> 04:04.285
destroy the last key car.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.120
How? Do you know where it is?

04:06.204 --> 04:09.707
What is this, twenty questions?
I know exactly where it is!

04:09.791 --> 04:13.086
The last key car
was owned by billionaire Cleve Kelso.

04:13.169 --> 04:17.382
He begged the military to look after it
with all these thefts going on.

04:17.465 --> 04:20.510
He won't be happy
that I’m going to destroy it...

04:20.843 --> 04:24.639
But what about Frostee?
You can’t leave him with that psychopath!

04:24.847 --> 04:29.018
Intelligence agents and the military
are searching for him as we speak.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.438
I've no intention of leaving him
but we must prioritize!

04:32.522 --> 04:34.565
Frostee should be your priority!

04:34.649 --> 04:37.235
Let me give you all a word of warning:

04:37.318 --> 04:41.239
making decisions based on emotions
leads to trouble.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.742
That’s how I ate
six pints of ice cream last night.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.078
-[truck engine starts]
-Let’s go.

04:57.714 --> 05:01.843
Yo, we’ll get him back, Cisco.
We never leave family behind.

05:01.926 --> 05:05.138
I can’t help but worry about
my Frost-bite, you know?

05:05.221 --> 05:07.974
Poor Tee-tee. He’s all alone.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.518
Are these new nicknames, or...?

05:10.601 --> 05:13.521
And I know he annoyed me
something crazy, but...

05:14.439 --> 05:18.735
[sobs] I’d do anything
to have him here annoying me now.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.656
-Nuh-uh-uh! Step away from the Yoka!
-[siren blares]

05:23.740 --> 05:25.825
Nuh-uh-uh! Step away...

05:25.908 --> 05:28.036
Wow, you kinda got your wish.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.997
I just... I just miss him so much!

05:31.914 --> 05:33.958
There you are! What are you doing?

05:34.042 --> 05:37.295
Just having a nice quiet moment
thinking about Frostee.

05:37.378 --> 05:40.256
Come on. I got an idea
on how to get him back.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.133
Here's the plan:

05:42.508 --> 05:46.888
steal the key car from Ms. Nowhere
and exchange it with Shashi for Frostee.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.264
What do you think?

05:48.347 --> 05:49.891
That might actually work.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.102
Are you cool giving Shashi
the key to a super weapon?

05:53.352 --> 05:54.771
We don’t have a choice.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.441
Frostee is family.
We won't wait for Ms. Nowhere to save him.

05:58.941 --> 06:03.488
I love it! Man, for Frostee, I’d give
the key car to a monkey on a motorcycle.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.532
Would the monkey need a car
if it had a motorcycle?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.117
I don’t know. Rainy days?

06:08.201 --> 06:11.329
We’ll worry about
Shashi using Skeleton Key later.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.706
Step one is finding the car.

06:14.165 --> 06:17.460
Maybe if I had a tracker...
Nah, too late for that.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.129
-M-Maybe satellites and hacking?
-Like what?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.130
[Cisco groans]

06:21.380 --> 06:23.966
I don’t know. It's what Frostee would say.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.134
Let's think quick.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.846
Ms. Nowhere is headed off
to destroy our only bargaining chip.

06:28.930 --> 06:29.847
[Echo] Got her.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.768
-“Steppin’ On Up”?
-It tracks Ms. Nowhere’s steps.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.561
It also tracks her location.

06:35.853 --> 06:40.399
Oh, man, privacy. What happened to it,
you know what I’m saying?

06:40.483 --> 06:41.317
Where is she?

06:41.400 --> 06:44.070
Currently, in the desert
outside of the city.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.154
Wait, hold up.

06:45.613 --> 06:49.492
[Echo] It’s blacked out.
It must be a military base or something.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.995
How are we going to get into
a military black site,

06:53.079 --> 06:56.958
get the last key car and get out?
We don’t even have our cars.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.419
[stirring music intensifies and fades]

07:00.503 --> 07:03.422
[Shashi] You'll do anything for family,
won’t you?

07:04.006 --> 07:04.841
It’s a deal.

07:05.383 --> 07:09.011
If you can get me that last car,
I’ll give you Frostee back.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.596
There’s one catch.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.599
To pull off this heist,
we’ll need our tech man.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.394
We gotta have Frostee behind a computer.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.025
[Frostee groans, gasps]

07:23.109 --> 07:27.113
Tony, Echo, Cisco! [laughs]
Man, it’s good to see you guys!

07:27.196 --> 07:29.824
Frostee, are you okay?
Are you eating enough?

07:29.907 --> 07:32.577
Blink twice if your mattress is too soft!

07:32.660 --> 07:35.872
I’m okay for a kid
who’s been handcuffed and kidnapped

07:35.955 --> 07:37.748
and whose life is threatened.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.793
Except I am totally bored.

07:41.210 --> 07:45.715
Come, on guys... I spy
with my little eye something that is gray.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.134
He hasn’t stopped talking for 12 hours.

07:48.509 --> 07:53.764
It has a keyboard attached to it
and rhymes with "flomputer"!

07:53.848 --> 07:56.350
We need help
breaking into a military base.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.437
Huh! Sounds exciting! When do we start?

07:59.520 --> 08:00.354
Immediately.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.440
Computer! [laughs]

08:02.523 --> 08:05.526
Yes! I got it! [scoffs]

08:06.277 --> 08:08.279
[military drum music plays]

08:22.001 --> 08:23.836
It’s time to destroy the car.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.254
Hang on there, missy.

08:25.713 --> 08:26.547
Excuse me?

08:26.923 --> 08:30.009
This car is the private property
of Cleve Kelso,

08:30.092 --> 08:34.263
and I don’t think he handed it over
to us just so we could blow it up.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.684
Besides, the way I see it,
we got the car and we got Layla Gray.

08:38.768 --> 08:42.188
If we find Dhar’s location
we get the rest of the cars

08:42.271 --> 08:44.524
and take Skeleton Key for ourselves.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.901
General, that’s not the plan.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.695
Yeah, well maybe it’s time
the plan changed.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.199
Get Gray to an interrogation room.
Find out what she knows.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.408
That won't happen.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.871
All due respect, no one waltzes in here
and tells me what to do.

08:58.955 --> 09:03.167
Well, I can assure you, General,
that I’m not no one, I’m Nowhere.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.378
Ms.  Nowhere.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.755
That supposed to mean something to me?

09:08.506 --> 09:09.674
[drums play]

09:09.757 --> 09:12.969
It means I have full authority
over this operation,

09:13.052 --> 09:17.056
and as my first act
I hereby relieve you of duty.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.600
This is my base now.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.894
Agents, get him out of my sight.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.563
[tense music plays]

09:24.021 --> 09:28.317
Now excuse me
while I "waltz" wherever I please.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.114
Although I’m more of a cat daddy lady.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.450
Gary, let’s destroy that car.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.369
[Tony]  We’re in position.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.163
[knuckles crack] Let’s make it happen.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.755
[car engine in the distance]

09:53.926 --> 09:56.178
There's movement beyond the perimeter.

[rock music plays]

10:09.066 --> 10:11.819
-You'd better not be messing with me!
-I’m not!

10:11.902 --> 10:16.490
Help us do this and you’ll have the
sweetest one-of-a-kind ride on the block.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.242
[Mitch] All right.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.202
-[Mitch] Hey, Echo?
-Yeah?

10:20.286 --> 10:21.120
Be careful.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.496
Toughen up, outlaw.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.586
Pull over immediately!
You are in a restricted area.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.051
[screams]

10:37.011 --> 10:38.054
[Echo]  I’m on!

10:43.643 --> 10:48.189
[soldier] Just a Flat Earther with a
homemade rocket. We’re heading back.

10:48.272 --> 10:51.525
[atmospheric music plays]

11:02.119 --> 11:02.953
[gasps]

11:05.706 --> 11:09.710
Okay, so this is a secure facility,
so step one is to blend in.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.671
[gasps]

11:15.091 --> 11:16.592
Now that’s some respect.

11:17.259 --> 11:21.764
Step two: intercept and up-link the main
security hub to me so I have access.

11:21.847 --> 11:25.684
The station you need to get to
is across the base, so stay hidden.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.229
[alarm rings]

11:29.647 --> 11:31.565
[man] Ma’am, can I see some ID?

11:33.609 --> 11:38.197
Ms. Nowhere, a snot-nosed officer
fresh out of the academy is harassing me.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.117
Permission to release the laser-bees?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.284
[screams] No!

11:44.829 --> 11:48.624
Okay, I said stay hidden, but you do you.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.377
The main building has
an annex attached to it.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.213
That’s where you'll intercept
the transmission.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.472
-[power surges]
-[alarm sounds]

12:06.976 --> 12:10.646
Nice job, Agent Echo!
Now I can control everything on the base.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.193
Layla’s not welcome anywhere these days.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.741
Okay, I got eyes and ears everywhere.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.870
[both pant and grunt]

12:30.458 --> 12:32.960
[Frostee laughs]
You're past the landmines.

12:33.377 --> 12:37.173
Actual landmines?! There were landmines
and you didn’t tell us?

12:37.256 --> 12:42.136
[Frostee]  Yeah. I knew you might get
nervous and accidentally blow yourself up!

12:42.219 --> 12:44.180
So, you’re welcome!

12:44.263 --> 12:47.099
-Oh... Uh, thanks? [gasps]
-[door opens]

12:50.603 --> 12:51.437
Phew!

12:55.191 --> 12:56.692
[Echo] I hope these fit.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.363
-[music fades]
-[power surges]

13:06.076 --> 13:09.705
The government spent a billion dollars
on a watermelon juicer.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.290
Your tax dollars at work.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.083
It’s an incinerator!

13:13.167 --> 13:18.339
I’m excited to use it on something other
than melons and photos of old boyfriends.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.008
Also, I can do without the sass.

13:21.800 --> 13:26.305
I’m starting to question whether it was
a good idea to keep Layla so close.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.808
Great. Thank you
for the thoughtful reflection.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.769
Get the key car in place.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.729
[low tense music plays]

13:35.731 --> 13:36.565
Turn right.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.823
[Echo] I got eyes on the hauler.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.409
[Cisco groans] What size is this outfit?

13:47.493 --> 13:50.913
And what’s it made out of?
It’s a polyblend, isn’t it?!

13:50.996 --> 13:53.207
It’s making me sweat like crazy.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.210
-More than your normal nervous sweating?
-Yes!

13:56.293 --> 13:58.587
-[tearing]
-Whoa. That’s a lot of sweat.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.298
-[tearing]
-[sighs] That's better.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.509
I’ll check the hangar’s clear.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.221
[loud beeping]

14:08.055 --> 14:09.223
Come on...

14:09.306 --> 14:11.809
Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?

14:12.184 --> 14:14.645
-[Cisco laughs nervously]
-[beeping]

14:14.728 --> 14:16.146
Let me get that for you.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.233
There you go.

14:19.316 --> 14:23.821
My wife suffers from sweaty palms, too.
A hand deodorant works nicely.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.865
[gasps] Thank you!

14:26.282 --> 14:27.908
[Echo and soldier grunt]

14:27.992 --> 14:30.953
Aw, why’d you do that? He was so helpful.

14:31.412 --> 14:36.792
Well, then let’s put him somewhere nice
and he’ll wake up rested and refreshed.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.549
Ready? There's not much time.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.471
I'm ready.

14:52.850 --> 14:53.684
I'm set.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.060
[knuckles crack]

14:58.314 --> 14:59.148
I'm go.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.774
Let's make some noise.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.864
[upbeat music plays]

15:07.907 --> 15:08.741
Yeah!

15:17.750 --> 15:20.544
[Echo whoops and laughs]

15:20.628 --> 15:22.838
[Echo] Yeah, that's right! Take that!

15:22.922 --> 15:25.299
[Echo whoops and laughs]

15:43.275 --> 15:45.527
[alarm rings]

15:52.159 --> 15:54.578
It’s SH1FT3R! Stop them!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.874
[pants]

15:59.541 --> 16:01.126
[groans]

16:01.835 --> 16:06.131
Tony Toretto.
I’m actually impressed... with myself!

16:06.215 --> 16:10.219
Don’t destroy the car.
Shashi might hurt Frostee. [groans]

16:10.552 --> 16:13.847
What did I say about
emotions clouding your judgement?

16:14.223 --> 16:17.601
I will destroy the car.
And you will go to jail.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.478
[Layla and Ms. Nowhere grunt]

16:19.561 --> 16:21.689
[music intensifies]

16:21.981 --> 16:25.651
I can’t believe you let Layla out.
You know she’s a wild card.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.445
She’s the only card we got.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.198
Get the car and get out.
I’ll hold her off!

16:31.657 --> 16:34.201
Oh, she’s helping us! Yes!

16:34.284 --> 16:38.330
Layla Gray, so unpredictable.
That’s what I love about her.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.082
You think you can take me?

16:40.165 --> 16:44.628
I do Pilates three times a week and
tae kwon do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.965
Yeah, well I grew up in Gum Neck,
North Cackalacka.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.511
Maybe it'll be a scrap after all.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.310
Go! Go!

17:09.153 --> 17:11.488
What are you waiting for, Toretto?

17:11.572 --> 17:14.700
-He doesn’t want to leave Layla.
-It’s her or you.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.996
[Layla] I said, go!

17:20.372 --> 17:22.041
[power surges]

17:27.588 --> 17:28.422
[music fades]

17:29.673 --> 17:30.841
Wild card.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.760
[upbeat music plays]

17:43.353 --> 17:45.189
Whoo! That’s right!

17:45.564 --> 17:47.733
Frostee, find a getaway vehicle?

17:48.984 --> 17:50.527
[gasps] Coming right now!

18:08.921 --> 18:10.380
Whoa!

18:13.634 --> 18:15.427
I’ve flown a lot of drones,

18:15.511 --> 18:18.639
but it's my first time
piloting a flying cruise ship.

18:18.722 --> 18:23.018
This is the craziest heist ever!
I can't believe you guys are still alive.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.061
I know, right?

18:24.144 --> 18:26.897
[thrilling music plays]

18:32.653 --> 18:33.862
How are we looking?

18:33.946 --> 18:37.407
[Echo]  As much as I like it,
I can’t hold them off forever!

18:39.576 --> 18:41.954
We’re looking good! Tony’s got the car!

18:42.037 --> 18:44.998
[Frostee]  And I got the plane!
Line up to load up!

18:47.042 --> 18:48.961
[music intensifies]

18:50.754 --> 18:52.047
[guns fire]

19:22.703 --> 19:23.537
Argh!

19:26.165 --> 19:29.168
Do not let the cars
make it aboard that plane!

19:31.920 --> 19:35.382
The plane’s exposed.
I must get to the runway and take off!

19:35.465 --> 19:37.384
[Tony] Do it! We’re coming!

19:44.641 --> 19:47.352
Guys, get in the hauler! I’ll ram through!

19:51.815 --> 19:52.858
Get on the plane.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.069
-[Tony] See you there!
-Whatchu doin', T? Come on!

19:56.153 --> 19:57.446
I won't leave Layla!

20:04.203 --> 20:05.913
Tony, I can’t stop the plane!

20:05.996 --> 20:07.873
Do not go back there, Toretto!

20:10.250 --> 20:11.835
Don’t worry. I’ll make it!

20:25.807 --> 20:28.185
-[music fades]
-[Layla grunts]

20:33.023 --> 20:36.485
You came back. I guess I’m family now.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.111
Don’t push it. Let’s go.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.156
Where am I supposed to sit?

20:42.366 --> 20:44.368
[thrilling music plays]

20:49.331 --> 20:52.542
-The plane’s about to take off!
-We better get on it!

21:04.972 --> 21:05.806
What?

21:24.616 --> 21:26.243
[Layla] Whoo-hoo-hoo!

21:55.397 --> 21:56.231
[all gasp]

21:58.066 --> 22:00.736
[Tony] We made it! Frostee, we’re coming!

22:00.819 --> 22:01.778
[all cheer]

22:08.452 --> 22:10.704
Bring me my jet.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.957
