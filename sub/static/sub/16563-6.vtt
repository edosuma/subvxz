00:00.062 --> 00:01.567
Previously, on Pitch...

00:01.577 --> 00:03.296
- You two have met?
- Hey!

00:03.331 --> 00:04.864
Mike Lawson and I have
been seeing each other.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.299
- Just for a few weeks.
- Now I'm going to L.A.

00:06.334 --> 00:08.286
where I have to see my
pain the ass ex-wife,

00:08.296 --> 00:10.163
who's just hell-bent on ruining my life.

00:10.173 --> 00:13.370
I got hacked. Pictures.
Selfies that we took from the road.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.501
- I quit.
- I will go with you!

00:15.511 --> 00:18.211
All this attention and celebrity,
it's only gonna get worse.

00:18.247 --> 00:20.247
So you better find a
friend and let 'em in.

00:20.282 --> 00:23.850
All right? 'Cause all of this
is way too much for one person.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.510
- I guess you've seen the video.
- The whole world's seen the video.

00:38.967 --> 00:42.035
I'm... not a regular
therapist, you know.

00:42.608 --> 00:44.958
So you can't just run down the clock.

00:45.157 --> 00:46.606
Game's gonna start eventually.

00:46.642 --> 00:48.742
Well, then we should get started,

00:48.777 --> 00:51.878
because you've been asked to
talk to me about last night,

00:51.914 --> 00:54.715
and I've been asked not
to leave until you do.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.350
So, I'm... I'm just supposed to

00:56.385 --> 01:00.170
talk about my darkest secrets
and my deepest fears, and all that?

01:00.346 --> 01:01.535
You will.

01:02.170 --> 01:03.835
But let's start easy.

01:04.072 --> 01:06.960
What have the last 48 hours
been like for Ginny Baker?

01:22.578 --> 01:24.778
Strike!

01:34.156 --> 01:35.622
Ginny!

02:08.187 --> 02:10.056
Pretty standard.

02:11.560 --> 02:16.944

02:27.242 --> 02:29.443
- Congratulations.
- Yeah. Whoo!

02:33.182 --> 02:35.282
- Thanks.
- Whatever you need, Ginny.

02:35.317 --> 02:37.284
And speaking of what you might need

02:37.319 --> 02:39.719
to play baseball in style...

02:46.361 --> 02:48.299
Ta-da.

02:48.309 --> 02:49.558
Wow.

02:49.568 --> 02:51.565
We know you may want
to break in the glove, but...

02:51.600 --> 02:53.800
we'd love it if you could
slip it on for a few shots

02:53.836 --> 02:55.635
at the signing party in Los
Angeles tomorrow night.

02:55.671 --> 02:56.903
I'm not sure this goes with the dress

02:56.939 --> 02:58.238
Amelia's promised.

02:58.273 --> 02:59.731
It matches your shoes perfectly.

02:59.741 --> 03:01.508
Not an accident.

03:01.543 --> 03:03.143
Not an accident.

03:03.586 --> 03:05.819
Now, we'd love to show you some mock-ups

03:05.854 --> 03:07.454
from the campaign we discussed.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.785
It's all about breaking barriers,

03:13.795 --> 03:15.829
paving the way for others.

03:15.864 --> 03:19.065
"The first black man in
Major League Baseball."

03:19.101 --> 03:21.301
"The first woman in space."

03:22.338 --> 03:25.505
"The first black president."

03:25.540 --> 03:27.274
And...

03:29.845 --> 03:32.812
"A new day is dawning in sports."

03:45.101 --> 03:47.627
But seriously, no pressure.

03:47.663 --> 03:49.696
- I love it.
- Me too.

03:49.731 --> 03:51.364
Thank you so much.

03:53.969 --> 03:55.368
It's hit to the shortstop,

03:55.404 --> 03:57.170
he leaps to make the catch!

03:57.426 --> 03:58.838
Can you shut it off if
you're not watching?

03:58.874 --> 04:00.507
I'm still working here.

04:00.542 --> 04:02.042
It's soft enough
to be able to time it...

04:02.077 --> 04:03.610
Must be casual Tuesday.

04:06.415 --> 04:10.115
So, if it's okay, Ginny invited
me to her thing tomorrow night.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.622
I probably should've invited you.

04:16.307 --> 04:18.791
Probably. But I don't bruise easy.

04:18.827 --> 04:20.994
That's a lie. Anyway,
if you thought the whole "us" thing

04:21.029 --> 04:23.229
would be weird for her,
she invited me, so...

04:24.263 --> 04:27.734
You think she's fine because
she acted like she was fine?

04:27.769 --> 04:31.137
You really don't
understand women, do you?

04:31.173 --> 04:33.506
- I think I understand women quite well.
- Oh?

04:33.542 --> 04:35.119
What's that saying? Uh...

04:35.129 --> 04:37.883
"True wisdom is knowing
how much you don't know."

04:38.433 --> 04:40.700
Unless you really do know...

04:40.735 --> 04:42.802
everything.

04:42.837 --> 04:44.103
Why is that charming?

04:44.138 --> 04:45.304
Why is that charming?

04:45.339 --> 04:48.407
See? I do know women.

05:21.943 --> 05:24.009
What's wrong?

05:24.045 --> 05:25.277
What time is it?

05:25.313 --> 05:27.012
Calm down.

05:27.048 --> 05:28.814
Just try to breathe normally.
I'll be right there.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.082
What's going on?

05:30.118 --> 05:31.517
Everything's okay.

05:31.552 --> 05:32.985
It's okay, but she can't breathe?

05:33.020 --> 05:35.621
She's just... having a panic attack.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.858
Got it handled.

05:44.481 --> 05:46.165
I'm just tired.

05:48.069 --> 05:50.536
Tired, but I can't sleep, you know?

05:50.571 --> 05:52.238
I know it well.

05:54.308 --> 05:56.675
What's keeping you up?

05:56.711 --> 05:58.544
I don't know.

06:01.315 --> 06:03.349
Just...

06:04.986 --> 06:07.153
Is it too late to go with someone else?

06:09.993 --> 06:12.491
The appropriate time to
have had that discussion

06:12.527 --> 06:14.860
was two days ago.

06:15.369 --> 06:16.848
When we had it.

06:16.858 --> 06:18.729
Remember, you loved

06:18.879 --> 06:20.566
that they viewed you as an athlete,

06:20.601 --> 06:24.036
treating you the same
as LeBron or Serena,

06:24.071 --> 06:27.406
and not using that workout
gear to hypersexualize you.

06:28.372 --> 06:30.176
You made the right call.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.665
Rest easy on that.

06:33.449 --> 06:34.665
I know...

06:36.984 --> 06:39.585
That's a big sweatshirt.

06:39.620 --> 06:40.920
I borrowed it.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.193
I'm sorry I woke you.

06:48.558 --> 06:50.196
Want me to stay for a bit?

06:50.231 --> 06:52.426
No. I'm fine.

06:53.395 --> 06:54.567
Really, I'm fine.

07:12.579 --> 07:14.886
Can you tell me about
your start yesterday?

07:14.896 --> 07:16.989
You can check the box score online.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.559
Well, I'm trying to
make it easy for you,

07:20.595 --> 07:23.462
but it's not multitasking if
you are just doing one thing.

07:23.497 --> 07:25.231
Don't take it personally, Doc.

07:27.902 --> 07:29.134
You are a "doc"?

07:29.170 --> 07:30.870
I am.

07:30.905 --> 07:32.404
Two kinds of doc, in fact.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.939
And a sports expert.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.641
Mm. Sports fan.

07:35.676 --> 07:38.377
But I'm an expert at stressful jobs.

07:38.412 --> 07:40.662
I was an army psychiatrist.

07:44.118 --> 07:45.584
Overseas?

07:46.312 --> 07:47.887
I spent some time in
Schweinfurt, Germany,

07:47.922 --> 07:51.490
and stateside, but yeah.
Some time in Iraq.

07:51.868 --> 07:54.960
My job was... hard.

07:54.996 --> 07:57.997
Too hard at a certain point, and...

07:58.032 --> 07:59.832
took a while to admit that to myself.

08:01.135 --> 08:03.335
Hmm. I get it.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.905
Want to know why I couldn't sleep?

08:06.990 --> 08:09.079
I don't belong with those people.

08:09.378 --> 08:10.776
Real heroes.

08:10.811 --> 08:12.444
I am a number five starter.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.948
I'm not the first woman...
I'm not even the first black woman...

08:15.983 --> 08:17.249
To pitch professionally.

08:17.285 --> 08:18.817
But no one remembers Peanut Johnson.

08:18.853 --> 08:20.085
Everyone's celebrating me?

08:20.121 --> 08:21.620
I mean, my...
my achievements are modest.

08:21.656 --> 08:23.522
Your stats are modest,

08:24.246 --> 08:26.846
but make no mistake.
Getting to the majors is historic.

08:26.856 --> 08:29.417
But I don't deserve to
be in that company.

08:29.690 --> 08:32.332
I don't feel like I deserve any of this.

08:36.172 --> 08:38.013
There, I said it.

08:38.739 --> 08:40.472
Did I have my breakthrough?

08:40.508 --> 08:42.508
Anyone who thinks that
they belong in that group

08:42.543 --> 08:44.877
would be having a different
conversation with me.

08:44.912 --> 08:48.180
And no... I don't think you're
going to have a breakthrough

08:48.215 --> 08:50.549
until you sit down and talk with me.

08:50.584 --> 08:52.685
All right. Well...

08:56.057 --> 08:57.790
I'm gonna go for a run.

08:57.825 --> 08:59.825
Okay, well...

08:59.860 --> 09:01.660
I'll tag along, and, uh...

09:01.696 --> 09:03.862
maybe you can tell me
about your last start.

09:04.416 --> 09:07.514
Two more runs come around to score.

09:07.524 --> 09:09.568
Baker's getting hit hard today.

09:09.603 --> 09:11.926
That puts the Pads in a six-run hole,

09:11.936 --> 09:13.872
with just one out,
here in the second inning.

09:13.908 --> 09:15.908
Lawson out to talk it over.

09:15.943 --> 09:17.343
Why are you changing the calls?

09:17.378 --> 09:19.211
- You shook me off.
- You never change the calls.

09:19.246 --> 09:21.914
Then why'd you shake me off?

09:21.949 --> 09:23.983
You having trouble breathing?
What are you...

09:24.018 --> 09:27.720
- You having a panic attack or something?
- What? I'm fine. It's 97 degrees.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.178
Why'd you just ask me that?

09:32.727 --> 09:33.759
You hurt?

09:33.794 --> 09:35.761
- I'm fine.
- Good, because

09:35.796 --> 09:37.062
our bullpen got wiped out yesterday,

09:37.098 --> 09:38.731
and you got to eat some innings for us.

09:38.766 --> 09:40.332
We're playing for tomorrow, kid.

09:40.368 --> 09:41.767
You got to wear it today.

09:41.802 --> 09:43.107
You got it, Skip.

09:47.894 --> 09:51.377
Come on, Lawson! If you
haven't said it yet, it's got to wait.

09:57.713 --> 09:59.546
Ginny!

09:59.581 --> 10:00.680
What happened?

10:00.690 --> 10:02.952
I just didn't have it today.

10:02.962 --> 10:04.794
Couldn't get my screwball
over for a strike.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.053
Ginny, any trouble with your arm?

10:07.089 --> 10:09.856
I've got no excuses. I just sucked.

10:11.793 --> 10:14.741
She had a bad game after four
quality starts. What's the problem?

10:14.751 --> 10:17.019
She came into my office the
day of the trade deadline

10:17.029 --> 10:18.600
to tell me not to trade her friend.

10:18.610 --> 10:20.237
First time I've ever
had a player do that.

10:20.247 --> 10:22.214
Well, you could've told me.
That's something I need to know.

10:22.249 --> 10:24.716
So I'm wondering if now is
the best time for this party.

10:24.752 --> 10:26.652
Maybe she shouldn't have
so many distractions.

10:26.687 --> 10:27.719
- What party?
- She signed a deal with Nike.

10:27.755 --> 10:29.588
The ad agency's throwing her a party.

10:29.623 --> 10:31.323
Lawson and Sanders are going, too.

10:31.358 --> 10:33.926
Look, I got in enough trouble
for treating her different.

10:33.961 --> 10:35.427
It sounds like everybody's
going to this party.

10:35.463 --> 10:37.930
Would you be so concerned
if Baker wasn't a girl?

10:37.965 --> 10:39.865
- Would you be so protective?
- Guys, look,

10:39.900 --> 10:41.066
she had two bad days, all right?

10:41.101 --> 10:42.835
It's a very limited data set.

10:42.870 --> 10:44.436
Now, if we tell her she can't go,

10:44.472 --> 10:46.605
it makes something that may
be nothing into a thing.

10:47.035 --> 10:48.240
So let's just...

10:48.275 --> 10:49.641
let it be.

10:51.672 --> 10:53.637
Why wasn't I invited to the party?

10:54.782 --> 10:57.349
- Okay, just look down.
- Ah...

10:57.384 --> 11:00.519
Really? A baseball flying at
you at 100 miles an hour,

11:00.554 --> 11:03.050
you breathe steady,
but mascara makes you shake?

11:03.060 --> 11:05.791
I can't believe I told Amelia that you're
as good as a professional makeup artist.

11:05.826 --> 11:07.392
You've literally poked me
in the eye every time.

11:07.428 --> 11:09.361
Well, I wouldn't if you just held still.

11:09.396 --> 11:11.196
- Putting it away.
- Thank you.

11:11.232 --> 11:12.931
Ah, that's Amelia with the dress.

11:12.967 --> 11:14.900
Uh-oh, what'd she do now?

11:14.935 --> 11:17.870
- Mike Lawson.
- What?

11:17.905 --> 11:21.355
- Blip figured it out.
- Ginny?

11:23.777 --> 11:25.377
I had to pull strings,

11:25.412 --> 11:27.279
twist arms and threaten lives,

11:27.314 --> 11:28.914
but someone was eventually

11:28.949 --> 11:32.451
generous enough to entrust
you with this $10,000 loan.

11:32.486 --> 11:34.453
Let me see, let me see, let me see.

11:34.488 --> 11:36.537
I wish Ginny was that excited.

11:39.994 --> 11:41.670
Ow.

11:42.119 --> 11:42.995
Holy crap, Ginny,

11:43.030 --> 11:46.131
that is the face of God.

11:46.141 --> 11:49.401
I mean, you're gonna look like, well...

11:49.872 --> 11:53.194
the tens of millions of dollars
that you're about to earn.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.634
Sounds good.

12:01.967 --> 12:05.017
You know, I stopped
expecting an-an attagirl.

12:05.052 --> 12:08.453
I'm just doing my job,
after all, but maybe tonight

12:08.489 --> 12:11.939
you can let loose a little, just...
give me a teeny smile?

12:13.609 --> 12:15.923
You're right.
You're just doing your job.

12:15.933 --> 12:19.464
And I'd like some reassurance
that whatever goes on here...

12:19.500 --> 12:21.787
and whatever goes on wherever
it is you and Mike do

12:21.797 --> 12:24.670
whatever it is you do, is separate.

12:27.241 --> 12:28.840
I'm gonna...

12:28.876 --> 12:31.843
not excuse myself,
'cause I want to hear this.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.685
I would never say anything to anyone

12:39.720 --> 12:42.082
about what's happening in your life.

12:43.223 --> 12:46.158
He was just there when you called.

12:48.362 --> 12:49.695
Point taken.

12:50.998 --> 12:52.965
You're not the person
I call in that situation.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.050
You negotiate contracts
and borrow pretty dresses.

12:56.937 --> 12:58.670
So let's leave it there.

13:10.584 --> 13:12.884
- You don't have to talk to me.
- Good.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.087
But you have a headache
that's not going away

13:15.122 --> 13:17.622
and I'm Tylenol. I suggest you take me.

13:19.323 --> 13:21.693
Okay, I admit that one got away from me.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.558
Why didn't I pitch well?

13:35.201 --> 13:38.010
I didn't get enough sleep, I...

13:38.045 --> 13:39.511
didn't have a feel for my screwball,

13:39.546 --> 13:40.746
blah, blah, blah.

13:40.781 --> 13:42.180
I was just terrible.

13:42.216 --> 13:43.749
Yeah, well, your terrible is

13:43.784 --> 13:46.251
still better than 319 million Americans.

13:46.286 --> 13:48.331
Doesn't make it not terrible.

13:48.719 --> 13:50.348
Tell me about the waitress.

13:58.999 --> 14:00.032
Over here!

14:00.067 --> 14:01.133
Ginny! Look over here!

14:01.168 --> 14:02.434
Ginny!

14:06.974 --> 14:07.973
- Mike!
- Mike Lawson!

14:08.008 --> 14:08.974
Mike Lawson!

14:09.009 --> 14:10.575
Mike, over here!

14:10.611 --> 14:11.810
Mike Lawson!

14:13.180 --> 14:14.913
Can we get a few of you together?

14:18.352 --> 14:19.651
You look really nice.

14:19.687 --> 14:21.586
Did you think of that on your own

14:21.622 --> 14:23.088
or did you hear Amelia say it?

14:23.123 --> 14:25.590
- I'm sorry, really.
- Mm-hmm.

14:25.626 --> 14:26.946
Ginny, over here!

14:29.296 --> 14:31.730
Well, it looks like
the main event is here.

14:31.765 --> 14:33.265
Ooh, good nickname.
Keep that one for you.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.933
- Main event?
- Excuse me, Blip?

14:34.968 --> 14:36.835
Can we get a few shots
with your teammates?

14:36.870 --> 14:39.171
Uh, he's not taking any photos
for you unless you pay him.

14:39.206 --> 14:40.639
Mm.

14:40.674 --> 14:42.074
Mm.

14:42.109 --> 14:43.975
We probably could've got some swag.

14:44.011 --> 14:45.651
Big picture, babe.

14:45.661 --> 14:47.115
Main event.

14:49.236 --> 14:50.782
Ah!

14:52.909 --> 14:54.786
- I...
- Damn, Ginny.

14:54.822 --> 14:57.322
- The dress is something.
- Uh, it's not just the dress.

14:57.357 --> 15:00.526
Yeah, it's also that six-foot
wide head of yours, too.

15:00.536 --> 15:03.696
- We're so proud of you.
- Breaking barriers and making bank.

15:03.706 --> 15:06.021
This is so crazy.
I don't even know what I'm doing.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.433
Just smile, have a drink,
or five, and enjoy it.

15:08.469 --> 15:09.957
Excuse me.

15:10.133 --> 15:11.499
Oh, sure.

15:13.974 --> 15:15.207
Oh, I just wanted

15:15.242 --> 15:16.341
your drink order.

15:16.376 --> 15:17.376
No.

15:18.312 --> 15:19.778
I'm sorry.

15:19.813 --> 15:21.379
Um... surprise me.

15:27.054 --> 15:28.687
You know, I didn't see that coming.

15:32.726 --> 15:34.826
- What?
- She knows we know.

15:34.862 --> 15:37.629
Look, don't give it another
thought. Tonight is about you.

15:37.664 --> 15:39.865
How could I forget?

15:41.769 --> 15:43.201
What's so important?

15:43.237 --> 15:45.470
Uh, so, um...

15:46.310 --> 15:48.206
something...

15:48.242 --> 15:49.813
happened on the mound today.

15:50.015 --> 15:51.209
You and I...

15:51.482 --> 15:54.037
what we're doing...
might've cost us the game.

15:54.047 --> 15:55.680
You know what? It's-It's okay.

15:55.716 --> 15:57.516
- What?
- We don't have to do a whole thing.

15:57.551 --> 15:59.251
I've seen the end of this movie.

15:59.286 --> 16:00.852
- No, I was just...
- You don't want to do this anymore.

16:00.888 --> 16:02.187
No, that's not what I'm saying.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.055
- I mean, I...
- Okay, then I'll say it.

16:04.091 --> 16:05.423
I've gotten used to being the bad guy.

16:05.459 --> 16:07.159
It's just... it's...
complicated, with Ginny...

16:07.194 --> 16:10.744
Yeah, see, this is the whole
part that I was hoping to skip.

16:11.726 --> 16:14.246
You know, your head wasn't
really in it, anyway.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.075
You should figure out where it's been.

16:18.205 --> 16:20.505
In the meantime, get a drink...

16:20.541 --> 16:22.774
and enjoy the party that I've
spent every waking minute

16:22.810 --> 16:25.043
of the last two years trying to throw.

16:27.981 --> 16:29.915
What are we drinking?

16:29.950 --> 16:31.516
We can toast to being the people

16:31.552 --> 16:33.718
assisting the people
making all this happen.

16:33.754 --> 16:35.086
Oh, I like where your head's at,

16:35.122 --> 16:36.955
but you don't want what I'm having.

16:37.389 --> 16:38.886
Is it super girly?

16:38.896 --> 16:41.693
Because I get down with a
French 75 or Lemon Drop.

16:41.728 --> 16:43.261
I'd do a daiquiri of any type.

16:43.297 --> 16:45.096
I go crazy for Blue Hawaiians.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.533
I thought you were just flirting,
but now I think you actually

16:48.569 --> 16:50.793
like neon-colored drinks.

16:50.803 --> 16:52.871
Thank you.

16:54.975 --> 16:58.143
I guess an assistant's work
is literally never done.

16:58.525 --> 17:00.023
Nope.

17:06.619 --> 17:08.198
Oh, thanks, man.

17:08.208 --> 17:10.555
- They were both for me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

17:11.417 --> 17:14.092
Listen... now that the
cat's out of the bag,

17:14.127 --> 17:15.660
I got to say this: at first,

17:15.695 --> 17:17.561
I wasn't sure about this
whole Amelia thing,

17:17.598 --> 17:19.431
but now I think it's a good idea.

17:19.465 --> 17:21.433
She might be a shark,
but you're no guppy.

17:21.468 --> 17:22.800
She's age appropriate.

17:22.836 --> 17:24.069
She's strong.

17:24.104 --> 17:26.738
I figured you weren't dating
anybody else seriously

17:26.772 --> 17:28.840
because, you know,
you weren't over Rachel yet,

17:28.876 --> 17:30.876
but if this means you are,

17:31.537 --> 17:32.799
good on you.

17:36.470 --> 17:38.573
You just broke up with her, didn't you?

17:41.397 --> 17:45.023
Here. You need this more than I do.

17:45.377 --> 17:48.126
- What, I think I hear Evelyn call...
- Mm.

17:49.529 --> 17:51.831
Ginny, can I get a picture with you?

17:51.841 --> 17:54.032
Yeah, sure.

17:54.067 --> 17:55.700
Ginny, we love you!

17:55.736 --> 17:57.736
Hey, Ginny! Me, too.

18:01.541 --> 18:03.708
Ginny, over here.

18:03.744 --> 18:05.110
Ginny, can I get a smile?

18:05.145 --> 18:07.512
Ginny! Ginny! Ginny!

18:21.061 --> 18:22.530
There you are.

18:22.540 --> 18:23.695
Here.

18:23.730 --> 18:25.386
I call it a KGB Mule.

18:25.396 --> 18:28.566
It's a Moscow Mule,
but covert in a rocks glass.

18:35.208 --> 18:38.543
- Thank you.
- I'm Cara, by the way.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.584
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Ginny.

18:44.594 --> 18:46.718
It's been awhile since I had
to introduce myself to anyone.

18:46.753 --> 18:48.887
Seems like everyone I
meet already knows me.

18:48.922 --> 18:52.222
No, they don't know you.
They think you're that person.

18:52.759 --> 18:55.560
Eliot, have you seen Ginny?

19:00.172 --> 19:02.367
- Do you want to get out of here?
- I couldn't.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.002
There's no way.

19:06.518 --> 19:07.901
You got a car?

19:13.681 --> 19:16.851
She's my age, but she's
working my launch party.

19:18.585 --> 19:19.845
But she just...

19:19.855 --> 19:21.810
walked out on her job like
there were no consequences

19:21.820 --> 19:23.898
because there were none.

19:25.029 --> 19:27.337
She just graduated college.

19:33.763 --> 19:36.247
I actually had a ride to NC State.

19:37.237 --> 19:39.202
- So, what happened?
- I got drafted by the Padres

19:39.238 --> 19:41.118
before my freshman year.

19:41.128 --> 19:43.576
I thought about playing
college ball first.

19:43.586 --> 19:45.947
Ever wonder what might've been?

19:46.599 --> 19:48.578
- No.
- Really?

19:49.251 --> 19:51.815
You never thought,
"What if I'd gone to college?"

19:54.724 --> 19:56.856
It all led back to this.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.891
After my dad died,
everything felt so uncertain.

19:58.926 --> 20:00.893
I couldn't gamble and...

20:00.928 --> 20:03.009
and not get drafted again.

20:05.066 --> 20:08.466
I know "dead dad" is probably
a hot button topic for you.

20:08.903 --> 20:11.732
- You probably want me to talk about him.
- Actually...

20:11.742 --> 20:14.940
I want to talk about why you put
on those sneakers last night.

20:20.047 --> 20:21.284
Freedom.

20:21.294 --> 20:22.515
Will you get fired for leaving?

20:22.550 --> 20:23.549
Probably,

20:23.584 --> 20:25.217
but that job sucked. You know,

20:25.253 --> 20:27.186
you'd think those rich people
would be good tippers,

20:27.221 --> 20:29.784
but half the time they
don't even notice I exist.

20:29.794 --> 20:31.335
So...

20:31.634 --> 20:33.659
what are we doing with a night off?

20:34.729 --> 20:37.263
I probably need to get
back to San Diego.

20:37.298 --> 20:38.364
I need to be up early.

20:38.399 --> 20:39.532
Are you pitching?

20:39.567 --> 20:41.033
Wait, you're a pitcher, right?

20:41.068 --> 20:42.935
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:42.970 --> 20:44.436
But no, I'm not pitching.

20:44.472 --> 20:46.705
I just... I just got to
stick to my routine.

20:46.741 --> 20:47.907
Game starts at 1:00,

20:47.942 --> 20:49.608
so I need to be at the stadium at 8:00

20:49.644 --> 20:50.776
to get my work in.

20:50.812 --> 20:52.745
- Probably sounds brutal.
- No.

20:52.780 --> 20:55.114
It sounds nice to know

20:55.149 --> 20:56.415
why you're getting up in the morning.

20:56.450 --> 20:58.651
Yeah, sometimes, I open my eyes

20:58.686 --> 21:01.554
and I don't even know why I'm
supposed to get out of bed.

21:01.589 --> 21:03.389
That sounds...

21:03.424 --> 21:04.590
like a vacation.

21:04.625 --> 21:07.126
Anyway, that's tomorrow's problem.

21:07.161 --> 21:09.236
What are we doing tonight?

21:09.774 --> 21:11.096
Uh...

21:12.133 --> 21:13.574
I want to do...

21:14.769 --> 21:16.669
whatever you'd do if I wasn't with you.

21:19.275 --> 21:20.742
Okay.

21:23.845 --> 21:26.312
Blip. Hey, have you guys seen Ginny?

21:26.639 --> 21:28.491
- Not in awhile.
- Oh.

21:30.274 --> 21:32.785
- Have you seen Ginny?
- Uh, she's all over the place.

21:32.820 --> 21:35.287
- In person?
- Oh, no.

21:35.323 --> 21:36.822
Amelia. Have you seen Ginny?

21:36.858 --> 21:39.358
Oh, I just saw her in the ladies' room.

21:40.073 --> 21:41.193
Have you seen Ginny?

21:41.229 --> 21:43.629
- Nope. Listen...
- Nope.

21:53.474 --> 21:55.297
Do you want to change?

21:55.307 --> 21:57.276
I can't. My agent would
kill me if I lose it.

21:57.311 --> 21:59.160
- Okay.
- Is it weird?

22:00.446 --> 22:02.248
Not in a bad way.

22:03.751 --> 22:04.884
All right.

22:07.688 --> 22:09.021
Hey, guys.

22:09.056 --> 22:10.489
This is my friend, Ginny.

22:10.524 --> 22:12.391
Cara!

22:15.314 --> 22:16.328
No way.

22:16.364 --> 22:17.796
You're Ginny Baker.

22:17.832 --> 22:18.964
That's what I hear.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.666
Weird.

22:22.402 --> 22:23.527
It's L.A.

22:31.699 --> 22:33.913
You didn't finish your coffee.

22:33.948 --> 22:36.515
And since you're not into
ambitious cocktailing,

22:36.550 --> 22:39.418
maybe I could take you
out for a, uh, slow-pour,

22:39.453 --> 22:41.186
six dollar cup of coffee?

22:41.222 --> 22:43.322
Yeah, that sounds really nice.

22:43.357 --> 22:45.824
Hey, good for you, seizing the moment.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.505
I know, right?

22:47.515 --> 22:48.521
Oh.

22:48.531 --> 22:51.270
_

22:51.365 --> 22:53.766
- You need to deal with that?
- Nope, I'm good.

22:54.867 --> 22:57.427
_

22:57.437 --> 22:59.986
Ooh, it's, uh... really an emergency.

22:59.996 --> 23:02.441
- It's okay if you have to respond...
- Like...

23:02.476 --> 23:05.511
- an emergency-emergency.
- I-I get it.

23:05.546 --> 23:07.212
I mean, it's okay if your
job is important to you.

23:07.248 --> 23:08.714
But-but it's not, it, God...

23:08.749 --> 23:10.215
It's... just the thing

23:10.251 --> 23:11.948
I literally spend all my time doing.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.619
This isn't a good look on me, is it?

23:13.654 --> 23:15.120
Only if you don't own it.

23:16.036 --> 23:17.230
I should...

23:17.240 --> 23:19.258
get back to the office, anyway.

23:24.611 --> 23:27.299
- Where the hell are you?
- On my way.

23:28.664 --> 23:30.469
Oh...

23:31.025 --> 23:32.938
Okay, come on. Come on, Ginny.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.212
What else you got?

23:50.458 --> 23:52.458
Ha!

23:56.530 --> 23:57.930
What else you got?

24:10.044 --> 24:12.277
I need shoes.

24:13.481 --> 24:15.314
Can I borrow those?

24:20.721 --> 24:22.621
Ball me.

24:23.956 --> 24:26.625
- Wait, what about the dress?
- I can dunk in a dress.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.961
That's not what I meant.

24:54.855 --> 24:56.288
What else you got?

25:03.998 --> 25:05.929
That dunk's gonna be
all over the Internet.

25:05.939 --> 25:09.040
It already is.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.342
Man, I hate cameras.

25:11.378 --> 25:13.311
Yeah, well, overcome your fears.

25:13.346 --> 25:14.746
What do you mean?

25:14.781 --> 25:17.515
- I mean, hi. I'm Cara.
- Oh, my God.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.424
She's soaking wet, and, uh...

25:20.434 --> 25:21.920
Okay, first of all...

25:21.955 --> 25:25.056
First of all, this is gonna
be our new TV show...

25:25.091 --> 25:27.638
Oh, my God.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.664
Why did you have her phone, anyway?

25:32.699 --> 25:35.867
Because even at $10.000,
that dress does not have pockets.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.053
Uh-oh.

25:41.063 --> 25:42.941
How "Uh-oh"?

25:42.976 --> 25:45.049
Maybe not while you're driving.

25:51.785 --> 25:54.085
- Wait, what about the dress?
- Show me.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.960
- I can dunk in a dress.
- That's not what I meant.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.564
Can you find her from this?

26:06.599 --> 26:08.909
Now seems like a good time
to renegotiate my contract.

26:08.919 --> 26:10.902
- Eliot!
- On it.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.354
Oh, man.

26:31.491 --> 26:33.291
Hey, Rach, I was just, uh...

26:33.326 --> 26:35.458
You know, I was in the neighborhood.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.756
- Why didn't you call?
- Uh...

26:36.766 --> 26:38.695
you would have told me not to come.

26:38.705 --> 26:39.731
So you, uh...

26:39.766 --> 26:41.265
you put in motion sensor lights.

26:41.301 --> 26:42.767
- Uh, yeah. David did that.
- Ah.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.135
- He move in?
- No. He's

26:44.170 --> 26:45.770
trying to protect me from crazy people.

26:47.395 --> 26:48.673
- There he is.
- Mike.

26:49.329 --> 26:51.342
- David. it's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

26:51.642 --> 26:54.445
Yeah. Sorry, uh,
didn't mean to interrupt.

26:54.481 --> 26:56.781
Oh. Well, you're here.
Want to come in for dessert?

26:56.816 --> 26:59.150
Major League.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.147
Of course. I, uh... I know what you do.

27:01.157 --> 27:03.187
No, no, the movie.
This literally happens.

27:03.223 --> 27:05.957
Um, Tom Berenger shows up at his ex's

27:05.992 --> 27:07.658
during a dinner party.

27:08.359 --> 27:11.262
Look, uh, it's awkward if you leave,

27:11.297 --> 27:13.431
and it's awkward if you stay,

27:13.466 --> 27:15.767
so maybe you should come in.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.702
Well, it didn't go great in the movie,

27:17.737 --> 27:19.604
but my Uber already drove off.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.506
So... why not?

27:21.541 --> 27:22.507
Great.

27:22.542 --> 27:23.875
Great.

27:27.365 --> 27:29.506
No, but honestly, I-I think it's great

27:29.516 --> 27:32.462
that you and Mike are able to
still be friends like this.

27:32.472 --> 27:34.872
I hope that we can be friends
like this when we get divorced.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.455
Well, that says a lot
about Mike's maturity

27:37.490 --> 27:38.823
that he could be here tonight.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.992
You know, if I remember that scene,

27:41.027 --> 27:44.795
I think Rene Russo says he was
one of the best in baseball

27:44.831 --> 27:47.198
before he had the
problems with his knees.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.519
Yeah, that part you remember.

27:49.529 --> 27:51.669
I don't want to be weird,
but you're Mike Lawson.

27:51.704 --> 27:54.156
I can hardly believe
it myself sometimes.

27:54.166 --> 27:55.206
Can we...

27:55.241 --> 27:56.841
- Mm-hmm. Mm, yeah.
- Yeah?

27:56.876 --> 27:58.376
Oh, come on.

27:58.411 --> 28:00.311
All right, guys, squeeze in.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.179
Oh, that's a little too
close. There we go.

28:02.215 --> 28:03.848
- Even better.
- That's good.

28:03.883 --> 28:06.598
- Awesome. Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.890
Come on, Ginny.

28:13.262 --> 28:15.560
Why'd you put on the sneakers?

28:16.654 --> 28:18.376
They want me to wear their glove.

28:18.386 --> 28:20.007
So what's wrong with that?

28:20.580 --> 28:23.196
My glove's the last
thing my dad gave me.

28:26.141 --> 28:28.873
There's that hot button again.

28:29.420 --> 28:32.043
- I know you want me to talk about him.
- Not really.

28:32.053 --> 28:34.720
You're the one who
keeps bringing him up.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.923
So why not stop skating around the issue

28:36.958 --> 28:39.767
by pressing the dead dad
button and tell me...

28:40.754 --> 28:42.628
why'd you wear the sneakers?

28:47.001 --> 28:48.868
There's nobody here.

28:48.903 --> 28:50.703
Are you sure this is the place?

28:50.738 --> 28:53.588
How accurate is Instagram's
geotagging anyway?

28:57.566 --> 29:00.780
Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty
sure this is the place.

29:05.481 --> 29:09.331
Damn it. Now she's probably, like,
running around somewhere naked.

29:09.824 --> 29:11.724
You know, after all the time

29:11.759 --> 29:13.623
I put into getting her this night...

29:13.633 --> 29:16.529
All the time we put into
getting her to this night.

29:20.702 --> 29:24.356
I always put other people ahead
of everything in my life.

29:24.366 --> 29:26.698
That's why I'm living in a hotel.

29:26.708 --> 29:28.841
120 miles away from my friends,

29:28.876 --> 29:31.877
my band, my girlfriend.

29:34.048 --> 29:37.079
I-I didn't know that
you had any of those.

29:37.089 --> 29:39.285
I don't anymore!

29:41.048 --> 29:44.448
I know you made a big sacrifice
when you left the agency,

29:44.690 --> 29:46.822
but I made sacrifices, too.

29:46.903 --> 29:48.569
Now, I stopped expecting a "thank you"

29:48.604 --> 29:50.471
for just doing my job,

29:50.506 --> 29:53.708
but I do a lot more than that.

29:57.133 --> 29:58.612
Fine.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.216
I will give you a raise.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.253
And a job title.

30:06.820 --> 30:09.590
Director of Social Media.

30:11.756 --> 30:13.077
Fine.

30:14.787 --> 30:18.132
Just get your head on straight
and help me fix this thing.

30:19.202 --> 30:21.775
What was your band's name, anyway?

30:21.785 --> 30:23.904
Uh, Rick's Prom Dress.

30:23.940 --> 30:26.107
We sucked.

30:26.546 --> 30:28.943
- Should we call the LAPD?
- Her agent's trying to find her.

30:28.978 --> 30:30.376
Technically, the only rules

30:30.386 --> 30:33.614
she's violated so far involve
a trampoline and a basketball.

30:33.649 --> 30:36.417
Still, I think we have to
ask the hard question.

30:36.452 --> 30:37.885
Do we think she has the
makeup to handle this?

30:37.920 --> 30:39.520
Maybe it is her handling it.

30:39.555 --> 30:40.955
Maybe we need to let her
deal with it her way.

30:40.990 --> 30:42.423
Or maybe we should consider

30:42.458 --> 30:44.225
letting her get her head
straight in triple-A,

30:44.260 --> 30:46.227
- away from the spotlight.
- What a surprise.

30:46.262 --> 30:47.628
The exact opposite of what I want.

30:47.663 --> 30:49.029
You know, I used to think
you were just doing

30:49.065 --> 30:50.464
what Frank told you,
now I'm not so sure.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.899
- Al, enough.
- Guys...

30:51.934 --> 30:54.602
we have both a moral
and economic imperative

30:54.637 --> 30:56.904
to protect her,
and I'm thinking that maybe

30:56.939 --> 30:59.339
we don't have the tools to solve this.

30:59.617 --> 31:01.976
So I'm gonna make a call.

31:09.152 --> 31:11.552
Mm... Man, you can eat.

31:11.587 --> 31:13.120
Body's a machine, it needs fuel.

31:13.156 --> 31:15.022
Yeah.

31:17.026 --> 31:20.227
I want to go to the beach.
See the sunrise.

31:20.263 --> 31:22.163
You can't see the sunrise
on the west coast.

31:22.198 --> 31:24.298
'Cause the sun rises in the east.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.601
I want to go to the beach anyway.

31:30.039 --> 31:31.839
You know I live ten
minutes from the beach,

31:31.874 --> 31:33.599
and I still haven't seen it?

31:33.609 --> 31:36.493
- So let's go.
- Wait, don't you have to be in at 8:00?

31:36.503 --> 31:38.186
That's tomorrow's problem.

31:39.584 --> 31:40.815
Let's go to the beach!

31:40.850 --> 31:43.450
- Yay!
- Okay!

31:51.375 --> 31:55.579
- You don't have to do that.
- Oh, I'm happy to.

31:56.595 --> 31:58.850
So David left pretty early.

31:58.860 --> 32:01.134
Yeah, he has surgery in the morning.

32:01.144 --> 32:03.854
Oh, no. Is he okay?

32:04.296 --> 32:06.631
I do not understand why
you keep making me repeat

32:06.641 --> 32:08.407
"pediatric heart surgeon."

32:08.443 --> 32:10.543
Maybe I need to be
reminded how you found

32:10.578 --> 32:12.745
- a good guy this time.
- Oh.

32:12.780 --> 32:15.080
I didn't know the pity parade
was running this late.

32:15.116 --> 32:16.982
Oh, God.

32:17.604 --> 32:20.886
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry I didn't call.

32:20.922 --> 32:23.541
I really don't want
to disrupt your life.

32:24.970 --> 32:26.358
Then don't.

32:28.763 --> 32:30.296
I'm still in love with you.

32:34.454 --> 32:37.136
You only want me because
you can't have me.

32:38.193 --> 32:39.472
And because you're drunk.

32:39.507 --> 32:41.006
You're wrong.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.442
Take me back and I'll prove it.

32:43.612 --> 32:46.812
Mike... you like chasing.

32:46.848 --> 32:48.314
You don't like having.

32:49.155 --> 32:50.349
The second you get what you want,

32:50.384 --> 32:52.690
you figure out a way to throw it away.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.320
You didn't start fighting
for me until I was

32:54.355 --> 32:55.855
halfway out the door.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.590
That's too late to start
fighting for someone.

32:57.625 --> 33:00.293
- I'm an idiot.
- Well, obviously.

33:01.811 --> 33:03.591
So, what do I do?

33:07.956 --> 33:09.763
Have some coffee.

33:10.799 --> 33:12.587
Go home, and...

33:14.339 --> 33:16.420
figure out what you really want.

33:16.957 --> 33:20.907
But sort yourself out before you
drag anyone else into your garbage.

33:24.930 --> 33:27.386
I have a habit of doing that.

33:29.530 --> 33:30.956
Well, I know I don't...

33:31.918 --> 33:34.994
deserve it, but I really
do appreciate the advice.

33:36.489 --> 33:38.898
Well, you don't deserve it.

33:42.203 --> 33:43.936
But it's very helpful.

33:55.147 --> 33:57.416
This is not helpful.

34:16.571 --> 34:19.304
Oh, thank God.

34:21.969 --> 34:25.469
Yeah. I had a feeling you didn't
really want to miss today.

34:37.214 --> 34:38.252
Thank you.

34:38.262 --> 34:39.792
- Oh, it was nothing.
- No.

34:39.827 --> 34:42.360
Not nothing. Thank you.

34:48.402 --> 34:50.469
I'll, um...

34:50.504 --> 34:52.338
I'll see you around, Ginny Baker.

34:58.639 --> 35:00.816
Hey, maybe get your car washed.

35:12.793 --> 35:14.460
How bad is it?

35:15.551 --> 35:18.704
I've seen the video of
your skills contest dunk.

35:18.714 --> 35:21.094
I mean, luckily, I was able to
shut down all the cell towers

35:21.104 --> 35:22.568
in the area before it hit the Internet.

35:22.603 --> 35:25.463
- Really?
- No. Ginny, I'm not Batman.

35:25.473 --> 35:26.939
The video is everywhere.

35:26.974 --> 35:29.108
Good news is that people love it.

35:29.143 --> 35:32.643
The bad news is that you were
wearing New Balance sneakers.

35:33.874 --> 35:36.015
- This is a disaster.
- You're gonna buy 100 tickets

35:36.050 --> 35:38.283
for veterans, each game, this weekend,

35:38.319 --> 35:41.185
and you're gonna give each
of them a Nike duffle bag

35:41.195 --> 35:43.980
- filled with Nike gear.
- I would have done that anyway.

35:43.990 --> 35:45.269
Um...

35:45.279 --> 35:47.296
Now, it's PR.

35:48.829 --> 35:50.829
Amelia, thank you.

35:52.647 --> 35:54.433
For everything.

35:54.468 --> 35:56.835
Everything you do for me.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.939
Just doing my job.

36:04.478 --> 36:07.435
I let down my... my teammates,

36:07.445 --> 36:10.849
my manager, my ball club, again.

36:10.885 --> 36:14.286
I... I know I'm a
representative of the team,

36:14.321 --> 36:16.955
and the game.
I take that very seriously.

36:16.991 --> 36:19.841
That's good. But we want
to discuss the video.

36:21.211 --> 36:23.511
I was just blowing off some steam.

36:23.521 --> 36:25.484
I didn't go to college.
I... I was just cramming

36:25.494 --> 36:27.503
four years' worth of
partying into one night.

36:27.513 --> 36:30.113
Yeah, we're not talking
about that video.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.407
I don't think I've ever done
anything like that before.

36:40.417 --> 36:42.514
- No?
- No. Is that... is that

36:42.550 --> 36:44.850
just like what your life is like?

36:44.885 --> 36:46.585
Oh, yeah. That's just,
like, a typical Wednesday.

36:46.620 --> 36:47.853
Wow.

36:51.124 --> 36:52.825
I can't believe I have to go back.

36:55.763 --> 36:58.130
I don't want to go back.

37:08.743 --> 37:11.343
I don't want to go back.

37:13.581 --> 37:15.581
I don't want to...

37:16.145 --> 37:17.850
I just don't want to do it
anymore. I just don't...

37:17.885 --> 37:20.219
I don't want to, like...
I don't want to take secret exits.

37:20.254 --> 37:24.040
I don't want to give careful
quotes. I don't want to...

37:27.182 --> 37:30.829
I don't want to smile when
I don't want to smile.

37:37.808 --> 37:39.834
She put this on the Internet?

37:39.844 --> 37:41.273
No.

37:41.308 --> 37:44.891
She gave it to us because
she was concerned about you.

37:46.495 --> 37:49.181
I watched her delete it,
even off the cloud.

37:52.450 --> 37:55.437
Not every person you meet
is out there to hurt you.

38:02.417 --> 38:04.296
I know what it looks like, but I'm...

38:04.331 --> 38:05.931
There are no buts.

38:05.966 --> 38:08.133
We've heard all the
excuses over the years.

38:08.169 --> 38:11.143
Hell, I've made most of them.

38:11.153 --> 38:13.238
Look, you mean a lot to
the Padres, and more

38:13.274 --> 38:15.407
than just dollars and cents.
We're all here for you.

38:15.442 --> 38:17.943
So, for starters,
I've called a psychiatrist,

38:17.978 --> 38:20.946
who specializes in high pressure
situations that you can speak with.

38:21.458 --> 38:24.016
Guys, I appreciate the concern.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.484
But, really, I'm fine.

38:25.519 --> 38:26.785
No.

38:27.269 --> 38:28.687
You're not.

38:43.025 --> 38:44.570
No, I'm not.

38:49.643 --> 38:52.346
I'll talk to your, um...

38:53.667 --> 38:55.414
your shrink, or whatever.

38:58.469 --> 39:00.018
Good.

39:00.054 --> 39:02.387
She's waiting for you in my office.

39:20.686 --> 39:22.674
Okay.

39:22.710 --> 39:25.177
Let's get started.

39:33.805 --> 39:36.477
Listen, I know I had...

39:36.513 --> 39:39.447
a breakdown in that bathtub.

39:39.482 --> 39:41.215
No. Crying in the bathtub was probably

39:41.251 --> 39:43.918
the healthiest thing you
did before talking to me.

39:47.157 --> 39:50.591
Man, I liked being around them.

39:50.627 --> 39:52.760
Normal girls, my age.

39:52.796 --> 39:54.262
Why?

40:05.308 --> 40:06.741
I know what I'm doing today,

40:06.776 --> 40:09.811
I know what I'm doing tomorrow.
I know what I'm doing...

40:09.846 --> 40:12.432
maybe even ten years from now.

40:12.442 --> 40:14.361
Well, some people might
be relieved to know that.

40:14.371 --> 40:16.617
But what if I don't want to do it?

40:24.127 --> 40:26.527
What if I don't want to play baseball?

40:26.563 --> 40:28.329
I mean, I can't quit.

40:28.918 --> 40:30.299
I'm the first woman in the majors.

40:30.309 --> 40:32.511
I can't just decide
to do something else.

40:32.521 --> 40:33.630
Why not?

40:39.437 --> 40:42.143
Because I'm not just me.

40:44.247 --> 40:46.347
I'm... I'm also...

40:48.318 --> 40:51.334
that, that person in the ad,

40:51.344 --> 40:53.955
the in-quotes Ginny Baker.

40:54.238 --> 40:55.710
I'm not that.

40:57.060 --> 40:59.193
I'm just me.

41:05.457 --> 41:07.902
And I don't know if I want to do this.

41:15.678 --> 41:17.678
Hey, look.

41:17.714 --> 41:19.480
The sky didn't fall.

41:23.019 --> 41:25.720
It's hard to reconcile those two things,

41:25.755 --> 41:29.023
the image that they put out
there and who you really are.

41:29.638 --> 41:32.167
- Yeah.
- And if you can't,

41:32.299 --> 41:35.863
you might act out to destroy that image.

41:39.202 --> 41:41.343
Like...

41:41.353 --> 41:43.671
putting on the wrong sneakers
after an endorsement deal

41:43.706 --> 41:46.340
- with everyone watching?
- Maybe like that.

41:46.376 --> 41:47.942
Yeah.

41:48.652 --> 41:50.244
Hey.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.948
You finally asked yourself the
question you've been afraid to ask.

41:54.551 --> 41:56.918
And that's a really good start.

41:57.675 --> 41:59.720
Now, comes the hard work.

42:00.585 --> 42:03.791
It's a good thing that you're
not afraid of hard work.

42:19.909 --> 42:22.910
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

42:22.946 --> 42:24.478
Really.

42:28.818 --> 42:30.477
I don't want to spoil that.

42:34.432 --> 42:37.065
Just rip off the Band-Aid, Amelia.

42:39.662 --> 42:42.964
The selfies hacked from Trevor's
computer have surfaced.

42:45.515 --> 42:47.001
You're kidding.

42:47.036 --> 42:48.982
Unfortunately not.

42:48.992 --> 42:52.106
The pictures are being released.

43:05.989 --> 43:07.688
Okay.

43:07.724 --> 43:09.057
What else you got?

43:09.067 --> 43:12.626
