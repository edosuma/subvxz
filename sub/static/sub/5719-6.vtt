WEBVTT

00:00.264 --> 00:02.163
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.183 --> 00:05.600
I made a lot of mistakes
in my life. A lot.

00:07.721 --> 00:10.523
And I appreciated the second
chances that I got.

00:10.558 --> 00:13.760
Hi. I'm Adam Barker.
I'm the math tutor.

00:13.794 --> 00:17.130
- Okay. This is Georgie.
- Yeah, we've met.

00:17.164 --> 00:18.998
Jade knows that guy
he's in one of her classes

00:19.033 --> 00:23.437
and she cannot stand him.
He's an arrogant ass.

00:23.971 --> 00:27.707
Amy? He's hurt.
Do you see all the blood?

00:27.742 --> 00:31.029
- A bear attack maybe.
- Yeah, that's definitely a bear.

00:31.049 --> 00:34.648
Hey, maybe that's what
we'll call him. Bear.

00:34.682 --> 00:38.056
- That kinda suits him.
- Yeah.

00:43.124 --> 00:45.125
Go.

00:45.159 --> 00:48.161
Whoa...

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:09.684 --> 01:12.852
Good boy, Bear.

01:21.696 --> 01:23.830
All right.

01:23.864 --> 01:26.566
Back, Bear. Back.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.635
Good boy.

01:28.669 --> 01:31.571
Back, back, back.

01:31.605 --> 01:34.841
Back, Bear. Whoa...

01:34.875 --> 01:38.093
Back, Bear. Back, back.

01:38.379 --> 01:40.013
That's it! Good boy!

01:40.047 --> 01:41.915
Teaching him to be a roper?

01:41.949 --> 01:45.819
Yeah. Dad wants to use him
in his rodeo school.

01:45.853 --> 01:47.287
Where's Caleb?

01:47.321 --> 01:49.956
Shouldn't Tim get Caleb
to do what you're doing?

01:49.990 --> 01:51.358
They're both out of town,

01:51.392 --> 01:53.960
so Dad just asked me to teach
Bear to work the rope.

01:53.994 --> 01:58.631
Tim gets you to help him, then he
takes off to a rodeo with Casey.

01:58.666 --> 02:01.868
You know what? I don't mind.
Bear is doing amazing.

02:01.902 --> 02:04.270
He's picking up on this
so quick.

02:30.131 --> 02:31.898
Lou! You're not gonna
believe this...

02:31.932 --> 02:33.600
You're right. I don't.

02:33.634 --> 02:37.537
Is that what I think it is?
Your final marks?

02:37.571 --> 02:39.839
- It's not what it looks like.
- Well, that's a relief.

02:39.874 --> 02:41.941
Because it looks like
you lied to me.

02:41.976 --> 02:44.110
Well, not exactly.
The school did say

02:44.145 --> 02:46.546
they were sending out marks
late this year...

02:46.580 --> 02:48.014
But then it came.

02:48.048 --> 02:50.483
- Georgie...
- I was going to tell you soon, I promise!

02:50.518 --> 02:54.387
But I'm... kind of scared
to open it.

02:54.422 --> 02:56.856
Okay, I get that.

02:56.891 --> 02:58.224
But you worked hard,

02:58.259 --> 03:00.593
and that's what's most
important.

03:00.628 --> 03:02.195
So whatever is in this envelope,

03:02.229 --> 03:04.831
we're gonna get through it
together.

03:15.275 --> 03:18.978
- "B" minus!
- In math?

03:19.013 --> 03:22.215
Oh, Georgie! Muah!
I am so proud of you!

03:22.249 --> 03:23.883
See? Obviously,
working with Adam

03:23.917 --> 03:26.185
is really starting to pay off.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.087
Wait. Wh-What do you mean,
"starting to"?

03:28.122 --> 03:29.956
This just proves
I don't need a tutor anymore!

03:29.990 --> 03:33.226
Okay, I admit that this is a positive
step in the right direction.

03:33.260 --> 03:36.195
But, honey, next year's gonna
be even more challenging.

03:36.230 --> 03:38.431
Just think how well you'll do
if you work with him all summer.

03:38.465 --> 03:41.100
So are you gonna force me
to have a stupid tutor forever?

03:41.135 --> 03:43.436
I will make you a deal.

03:43.470 --> 03:45.371
We can revisit this issue
when you're back in school

03:45.406 --> 03:47.206
if you keep your marks up.

03:47.241 --> 03:50.109
Well, I do have a way to get
extra credit in science.

03:50.144 --> 03:51.944
That's great. How?

03:51.979 --> 03:54.313
Volunteering at the Wildlife Reserve.

03:54.348 --> 03:56.149
I know I'm supposed to babysit
Katie tomorrow,

03:56.183 --> 03:58.051
but Bob's having a clean-up day.

03:58.085 --> 04:00.219
- Bob Granger?
- Yeah. He talked to the school

04:00.254 --> 04:01.587
and he's arranged for student
volunteers

04:01.622 --> 04:04.323
to get extra credit
during the summer,

04:04.358 --> 04:05.458
- so I signed up.
- I don't know, Georgie.

04:05.492 --> 04:06.859
That's...

04:06.894 --> 04:08.728
Well, it's an easy way
to boost my mark.

04:08.762 --> 04:12.065
Jade signed up, she's going.
She just texted me.

04:12.099 --> 04:14.901
And you'll keep working
with Adam?

04:14.935 --> 04:16.269
Okay, fine.

04:16.303 --> 04:18.004
Hello?

04:18.038 --> 04:20.740
Oh, yeah, speaking.

04:20.774 --> 04:24.043
Uh... a-a week early?

04:24.078 --> 04:25.878
Yeah, no, no, no,
that-that's fine.

04:25.913 --> 04:28.815
I-I just um...

04:28.849 --> 04:30.983
Okay. Thanks for
letting me know.

04:31.018 --> 04:32.452
Bye.

04:34.088 --> 04:36.856
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I just um...

04:36.890 --> 04:39.158
They moved Katie's ballet
recital up a week earlier

04:39.193 --> 04:43.329
and now I need to find a time
to make her costume.

04:44.765 --> 04:46.165
How's training going?

04:46.200 --> 04:48.768
Really good, actually.
He's being a good boy.

04:48.802 --> 04:50.236
Ty?!

04:50.270 --> 04:53.239
Ty, I really need your help,
man.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.877
I reintroduced this guy into
the wild a few months back.

04:57.911 --> 04:59.278
He's not moving much.

04:59.313 --> 05:01.247
No. It's been that way
since yesterday morning.

05:01.281 --> 05:02.949
His mate's been back
and forth, she seems fine

05:02.983 --> 05:05.952
but he hasn't left the nest...
not as far as I can tell.

05:06.286 --> 05:08.020
So you put a camera
in there.

05:08.055 --> 05:10.423
Two, actually.
Infrared for night viewing

05:10.457 --> 05:12.091
and live video streams online.

05:12.125 --> 05:15.227
- Well, what for?
- Well, to raise awareness, mainly,

05:15.262 --> 05:16.695
and viewers can make a donation,

05:16.730 --> 05:18.697
so it earns a few bucks
for the Reserve.

05:18.732 --> 05:22.401
Well, I'm not sure
what I can do.

05:22.436 --> 05:25.471
I wanna hire you just...
to check it out.

05:25.505 --> 05:27.193
Why don't you go?

05:27.213 --> 05:29.909
Well, I've organized this
clean-up day at the Reserve.

05:29.943 --> 05:32.111
I have some student volunteers
showing up.

05:32.145 --> 05:33.979
Georgie's one of them, actually.

05:34.014 --> 05:35.648
It was a hassle arranging it
all with the school,

05:35.682 --> 05:38.584
so I really don't wanna
reschedule unless I have to.

05:38.618 --> 05:41.520
Thing is, bad weather's
supposed to move in.

05:41.555 --> 05:43.622
It could make the eagle's
situation worse.

05:43.657 --> 05:45.491
Somebody needs to get there
before that happens.

05:45.525 --> 05:47.326
Where's the nest?

05:50.230 --> 05:51.630
Right here.

05:51.665 --> 05:53.499
Uh, two paths in the mountain
to get there.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.034
This is a scenic route.

05:55.068 --> 05:57.770
This is a shortcut,
but it's a little trickier.

05:57.804 --> 06:00.339
It only takes an hour on quad
to get there from the road,

06:00.373 --> 06:03.409
so probably a couple of hours
on horseback.

06:03.443 --> 06:05.544
Look, I'm-I'm in a jam here, Ty,

06:05.579 --> 06:08.347
and if this eagle can't fly,
he's in real trouble.

06:08.381 --> 06:11.117
So... you in?

06:17.683 --> 06:21.576
S09E06
Over and Out

06:21.778 --> 06:26.020
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:57.969 --> 07:02.032
Okay. So now we pour
the mixture into cups...

07:02.052 --> 07:04.136
- And I put the stick thing!
- That's right!

07:04.171 --> 07:07.293
Okay, ready?
Whoa. Oh, I spilled.

07:07.313 --> 07:08.507
'Kay, go ahead.

07:08.842 --> 07:11.777
Hey! Who was that I saw
driving in earlier?

07:11.811 --> 07:16.014
That was Bob Granger.
He was here to see Ty.

07:16.049 --> 07:18.684
So what, they talked
and now everything's fine?

07:18.718 --> 07:20.686
Well, Bob paid for his mistakes.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.688
Ty was satisfied with
what he had to say,

07:22.722 --> 07:24.790
and I guess he's willing
to move on.

07:24.824 --> 07:27.693
Well, it's just Georgie is planning
on volunteering at the Reserve,

07:27.727 --> 07:29.795
and frankly, I'm worried.

07:29.829 --> 07:32.764
Well, if Ty's okay with him,
that's good enough for me.

07:34.467 --> 07:35.834
- Hey!
- Hi!

07:35.869 --> 07:38.570
- We're making freeze pops!
- You are?

07:38.605 --> 07:40.372
Well, that sounds like fun.

07:40.406 --> 07:42.941
Lisa, thank you so much
for picking up groceries.

07:42.976 --> 07:44.510
Uh, dinner's gonna be
ready soon.

07:44.544 --> 07:46.778
No problem. I was in town already.

07:46.813 --> 07:49.281
This... this is for you and me.

07:49.315 --> 07:52.584
- My place after dinner tonight maybe?
- Count me in.

07:52.619 --> 07:55.621
And you, little lady, this is for you!

07:55.655 --> 07:58.657
Oh, Lisa, you shouldn't have!

07:58.691 --> 08:00.692
I used to have a tambourine.
I saw this one,

08:00.727 --> 08:02.861
- I remembered how much loved it!
- Ooh! Tambourine!

08:05.899 --> 08:08.433
Wasn't that nice of Lisa
to bring you a present?

08:08.468 --> 08:09.768
Uh, honey...

08:09.802 --> 08:11.103
- What do we say to Lisa?
- Thank you!

08:11.137 --> 08:13.038
- That's right.
- You're welcome.

08:15.542 --> 08:18.677
It's so cool
you get to go too.

08:18.711 --> 08:21.713
So just the two of you on a beautiful
mountain trail together, alone?

08:21.748 --> 08:23.190
Well, Scott can't make it.

08:23.210 --> 08:24.597
We're pretty swamped
at the clinic right now, so.

08:24.617 --> 08:26.485
Mm-hmm. Sounds like
a real tough assignment.

08:26.519 --> 08:28.954
I don't want him going alone.

08:28.988 --> 08:31.323
Besides, it will be good to see how
Bear does in the open country.

08:31.357 --> 08:32.957
Oh, I wish I could go.

08:32.991 --> 08:34.592
I thought you were excited
about going to the Reserve?

08:34.626 --> 08:36.461
I am. I can't wait!

08:36.496 --> 08:38.830
So, it looks like I need
a babysitter for tomorrow.

08:38.865 --> 08:41.700
- Lisa, I don't suppose...?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, no, of course.

08:41.734 --> 08:43.635
Spend quality time
with my goddaughter?

08:43.669 --> 08:45.671
Hello?

08:45.705 --> 08:47.940
Hey now, you two,
you be careful tomorrow.

08:47.974 --> 08:49.708
That area can be rough in spots.

08:49.742 --> 08:52.344
Yeah, for sure we will.

08:52.378 --> 08:55.314
Hey, Amy, I'm gonna go get us all
packed up for tomorrow, okay?

08:55.348 --> 08:57.616
- Okay. I'll be out in a bit.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

08:57.650 --> 09:00.319
- What's wrong?
- I have to run into Maggie's.

09:00.353 --> 09:02.654
- Go. We'll put her to bed.
- Are you sure?

09:02.689 --> 09:04.756
- I know you two had plans.
- Don't worry about it.

09:04.791 --> 09:07.459
- Get on your way.
- Okay. Thank you. See ya.

09:15.435 --> 09:17.669
Wait!

09:18.735 --> 09:20.305
Well, is that for me?

09:20.340 --> 09:22.641
- It's for the picnic!
- Oh, well, thank you!

09:22.675 --> 09:25.877
That's very nice of you,
Katie.

09:25.912 --> 09:28.714
You know, I'm not sure we're
gonna have time for a picnic.

09:28.748 --> 09:30.382
I know, but it'll be beautiful
up there,

09:30.416 --> 09:32.751
and just the two of you.
You should make the most of it.

09:32.785 --> 09:34.851
Well, I think before sunset.

09:34.871 --> 09:36.855
Well, I'll get a few things done
in the loft while you're gone.

09:36.889 --> 09:38.890
I'm not gonna wait for Tim
to get back.

09:38.925 --> 09:41.627
Thanks, but, I mean,
I'll be back so I can help you.

09:41.661 --> 09:43.996
- Oh, I'll take you up on that.
- Okay.

09:44.030 --> 09:45.931
You two are gonna be tired
when you get back.

09:45.965 --> 09:48.367
- You wanna come for dinner?
- We'd love to. Absolutely.

09:48.401 --> 09:49.701
Have fun.

09:49.736 --> 09:52.504
- See you tonight.
- All right!

10:00.880 --> 10:03.582
Aww! Is that the coyote puppy
Ty brought?

10:03.616 --> 10:05.651
Yeah. He's on the mend.

10:05.685 --> 10:09.388
Gonna release him back into
the wild in a couple months.

10:09.422 --> 10:12.257
Ah, can you believe we're doing
this for extra credit?

10:12.291 --> 10:14.793
This is gonna be awesome!

10:14.827 --> 10:16.728
Oh, here comes
the other recruit.

10:18.765 --> 10:21.099
I didn't know you two
would be here.

10:21.134 --> 10:23.769
Ditto.

10:40.319 --> 10:44.890
Well, I think this is it.

10:53.066 --> 10:56.401
I've never been here before.
This place is amazing.

10:56.436 --> 10:58.403
Don't say I never take you
any place nice.

11:04.711 --> 11:07.045
Come on.
Step down. Come on.

11:10.750 --> 11:14.753
Okay. Can I see the map?

11:14.787 --> 11:16.988
- Yup.
- All right.

11:27.066 --> 11:29.668
Looks like this is the path
we take.

11:40.012 --> 11:42.647
Okay. So...

11:42.682 --> 11:44.783
the deal with these puppies...

11:44.817 --> 11:46.752
is that you gotta be on
the same channel.

11:46.786 --> 11:49.154
So everyone go to 22.

11:49.188 --> 11:50.455
Okay.

11:50.490 --> 11:53.959
So now you press this to speak.
Hello, hello, hello, hello!

11:53.993 --> 11:55.794
Then you gotta take
your finger off

11:55.828 --> 11:57.395
to hear what the other guy says.

11:57.430 --> 11:59.364
Got it? Groovy gravy.

11:59.398 --> 12:01.466
So I got a bunch of chores
and cleaning I need done,

12:01.501 --> 12:03.602
but before you guys do that,
the skunk needs some water

12:03.636 --> 12:05.604
and the llamas need some hay...

12:05.638 --> 12:07.005
Oh, sorry. I gotta take this.

12:07.039 --> 12:08.406
You guys figure out
who's doing what, all right?

12:08.441 --> 12:10.742
Cool. Bob Granger.

12:10.777 --> 12:12.177
Who needs these ancient things?

12:12.211 --> 12:13.578
We all have cell phones.

12:13.613 --> 12:15.981
Walkies convert speech
into radio signals,

12:16.015 --> 12:17.682
so they are much more reliable
than cell phones in an emergency

12:17.717 --> 12:19.785
because they use radio
frequencies and not cell towers.

12:19.819 --> 12:22.821
Okay, Einstein, we get it.

12:22.855 --> 12:25.924
Fine. I don't care what I do
so you guys pick.

12:25.958 --> 12:27.859
Well, if you don't care,
then why are you here?

12:27.894 --> 12:31.463
Because the volunteer experience looks
better on my university application.

12:31.497 --> 12:33.632
University? That's eons from now.

12:33.666 --> 12:35.567
My mom's a professor
at the U of C.

12:35.601 --> 12:38.303
She says it's never too early
to start.

12:38.337 --> 12:42.908
Okay, well, we've got the
llamas, you can take the skunk.

13:09.268 --> 13:10.936
Lou, you're heading
to the Dude Ranch?

13:10.970 --> 13:13.338
Uh, yeah, that is my first stop.

13:13.372 --> 13:16.141
I have to get the cabins ready
for check-ins and then...

13:16.175 --> 13:17.375
I have a ton of errands.

13:17.410 --> 13:19.678
Well, you don't have anything
to worry about here.

13:19.712 --> 13:21.079
Katie and I are gonna be
just fine.

13:21.113 --> 13:23.662
Are you sure? I mean,
I know it's a lot to ask,

13:23.682 --> 13:25.016
especially after last night.

13:25.051 --> 13:27.018
No. Not at all. I wanna help.

13:27.053 --> 13:29.254
Okay. Oh, Grandpa,
where is my sewing machine?

13:29.288 --> 13:31.823
I swear I left it in the loft
and now I just...

13:31.857 --> 13:34.459
Aww, Tim moved all that stuff
out of there.

13:34.493 --> 13:36.227
- I'll take a look.
- Okay. Thank you.

13:36.262 --> 13:38.730
- That would be a big a help.
- Sewing machine for what?

13:38.764 --> 13:41.800
For, uh, making Katie
a ballet costume

13:41.834 --> 13:43.068
because she has a recital
coming up.

13:43.102 --> 13:45.637
Lou, do you have time for that?

13:45.671 --> 13:47.672
Oh, I'll make time. I used to love
making my own clothes as a teenager.

13:47.706 --> 13:49.641
Have you seen my phone?
I just...

13:49.675 --> 13:52.010
Well, I love to bake,
but if I'm busy,

13:52.044 --> 13:53.678
I'm gonna go to the bakery
and buy dessert

13:53.712 --> 13:55.847
so my guests can come
to their own conclusions.

13:55.881 --> 13:58.216
You know what?
They never know the difference.

13:58.250 --> 14:00.618
Okay, but you know, it's not
really the same thing, Lisa,

14:00.653 --> 14:02.654
because this is for Katie, and
I'm not the only mom doing it.

14:02.688 --> 14:03.988
Some of the other mom's are too.

14:04.023 --> 14:05.857
Well, that is fine for them,
Lou,

14:05.891 --> 14:09.661
but how many of those women are running
two businesses all by themselves?

14:09.695 --> 14:11.863
Um... I have to go.

14:14.033 --> 14:17.068
Well.

14:17.103 --> 14:21.072
Bob said the nest should be
visible from here.

14:38.257 --> 14:42.327
Well, I see the eagle.
He's on the ground.

14:46.298 --> 14:47.966
He looks injured.

14:52.799 --> 14:54.226
Oh, Katie, honey.

14:54.244 --> 14:55.477
It's almost time
for your ballet class.

14:55.511 --> 14:56.608
Do you need help getting ready?

14:56.628 --> 14:58.380
Nope! I can do it all by myself!

14:58.414 --> 15:01.583
Oh, good girl.
All right, you go do that.

15:01.618 --> 15:05.113
Whoops! All right. Ah...

15:05.521 --> 15:07.356
I don't think we're gonna get
any time to ourselves.

15:07.390 --> 15:09.558
Have you seen this schedule?

15:09.592 --> 15:13.462
Ballet classes, trick-riding,
tutoring sessions, just... wow.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.498
Well, Lou is just trying
to keep everybody on track.

15:16.532 --> 15:19.468
Well, no wonder. Who could
maintain a schedule like this?

15:19.502 --> 15:22.204
Hard enough if you don't own
a Dude Ranch or a diner.

15:22.238 --> 15:25.140
Not to mention everything
she does around here.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.209
Something's gotta give.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.513
Even these frozen treats
are homemade!

15:33.182 --> 15:37.219
Well, yeah. Well, we've gotta
cut her some slack.

15:37.253 --> 15:39.288
Just... Well, she's still
figuring things out.

15:39.322 --> 15:40.789
Oh, I get that.

15:40.823 --> 15:43.191
I mean, but she already needs
help covering,

15:43.226 --> 15:44.459
and then she's adding
something else.

15:44.494 --> 15:45.927
Like sewing those ballet
costume?

15:45.962 --> 15:48.030
Is a lot of extra work.

15:48.064 --> 15:49.815
I love lending a hand,
you know I do,

15:49.835 --> 15:53.869
but I get the sense that we are gonna
be needed more and more and more.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.205
Oh, can you believe that guy?

15:57.240 --> 16:00.776
Ugh! He drives me crazy.
Talk about arrogant.

16:00.810 --> 16:04.279
- Tell me about it.
- But he is kind of cute.

16:04.314 --> 16:06.448
- What?! You like him?
- No, of course not!

16:06.482 --> 16:08.383
He's way too young for me.

16:08.418 --> 16:11.486
If a guy isn't older, tortured,
or completely unavailable,

16:11.521 --> 16:13.221
apparently I'm not interested.

16:13.256 --> 16:14.990
But I'm not blind, either.

16:15.024 --> 16:17.526
And don't get me started on that
weird walkie-talkie monologue.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.361
I mean, why does he go on
like that?

16:19.395 --> 16:21.196
I don't know,
but he does it all the time.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.813
It's the worst.

16:22.833 --> 16:26.226
Well, he's got about a zero percent chance
of ever getting a date.

16:26.246 --> 16:30.472
I tried to get rid of him, but I'm stuck
with him tutoring me the whole summer.

16:30.506 --> 16:32.459
I've gotta ace
my first few tests.

16:32.479 --> 16:36.178
It's the only way Lou will ever let me
get rid of that stuck-up know-it-all.

16:36.212 --> 16:39.114
That kind of
attitude does not impress most girls.

16:39.148 --> 16:42.150
No kidding! and he's
a complete control freak.

16:42.185 --> 16:44.820
He's always trying
to tell me what to do.

16:44.854 --> 16:48.290
Yeah, I can't believe that guy.

16:55.064 --> 16:57.366
There he is.

17:01.337 --> 17:04.271
- Get the slicker?
- Yeah.

17:08.266 --> 17:11.279
- Ty, be careful.
- Yeah.

17:13.849 --> 17:15.650
Okay.

17:15.984 --> 17:18.318
Easy, boy.

17:19.794 --> 17:21.755
We're here to help you.

17:23.159 --> 17:25.542
- He's beautiful.
- Yeah.

17:26.028 --> 17:27.838
Easy...

17:28.664 --> 17:30.618
Easy now.

17:31.868 --> 17:33.202
Easy, boy...

17:33.903 --> 17:35.771
Easy...

17:36.839 --> 17:38.573
Easy now.

17:40.443 --> 17:43.078
Okay.

17:44.447 --> 17:46.314
- Get his wing?
- Yup.

17:46.349 --> 17:48.116
There.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.552
Easy, boy. Easy.

17:53.856 --> 17:55.891
Easy...

17:55.925 --> 17:57.359
Okay.

17:59.881 --> 18:03.355
Do you wanna hold him?
I could use your help.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.333
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:05.368 --> 18:06.968
Put your arm underneath him.
Yeah, yeah. Easy, boy.

18:07.003 --> 18:13.108
- Hey, bud. I know.
- Just put this arm down here.

18:13.142 --> 18:16.778
You're okay.
You're all right. I know.

18:16.813 --> 18:18.671
Okay.

18:19.382 --> 18:22.984
- Hey!
- Hello!

18:23.019 --> 18:26.288
Oh, Grandpa, you found it!

18:26.322 --> 18:28.356
I didn't expect you back so soon.

18:28.391 --> 18:30.792
Yeah, I finished up early,

18:30.827 --> 18:32.194
and I thought I would spend
the afternoon with Katie.

18:32.228 --> 18:34.362
Well, she's still out with Lisa.

18:34.397 --> 18:37.466
- What? Ballet ended hours ago.
- I don't know.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.501
I heard something about
shopping.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.337
I wish that Lisa had
checked with me first.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.440
Well, c'mon, Lou.
You can't ask Lisa to help you,

18:45.475 --> 18:47.976
then be upset with
how she goes about it.

18:48.010 --> 18:50.345
I am trying to make the most
out of what little time

18:50.379 --> 18:52.314
I have to spend
with my daughters.

18:52.784 --> 18:55.283
You do seem to have a lot
on your plate these days...

18:55.318 --> 18:57.319
Look, I'm trying to keep
the girls busy.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.766
I just, I want things to be
as normal as possible.

18:59.786 --> 19:01.370
Yes, I get that,

19:01.390 --> 19:04.893
but maybe you should think about
pulling back a little bit.

19:04.927 --> 19:07.528
Seems like you're taking on
more and more all the time.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.031
Is that keeping things normal?

19:14.003 --> 19:16.204
All right.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.506
Next, I need you guys to open up
the gates to three enclosures

19:18.540 --> 19:20.059
on the west side of the property.

19:20.079 --> 19:22.076
You're gonna have to hoof it though.
It's all there in the sketch.

19:22.111 --> 19:25.280
- How far is it?
- On foot?

19:25.314 --> 19:26.598
Fifteen minutes give or take.

19:26.618 --> 19:28.836
I'd drive you guys but I gotta
stick around here for a bit.

19:28.856 --> 19:30.486
I got a greater short-horned
lizard on the way in.

19:30.506 --> 19:33.354
Cool! They shoot blood
out of their eyes.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.756
I'm impressed.

19:34.790 --> 19:36.319
I could use a hand
with the delivery.

19:36.339 --> 19:38.626
- One of you wanna hang back and help out?
- I'll do it!

19:38.661 --> 19:41.396
All right. Fine by me.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.664
So you two are on your own,
for now.

19:42.698 --> 19:44.594
You cool with that?

19:47.269 --> 19:48.670
Is there a problem?

19:48.704 --> 19:51.472
- No, no. We're on it.
- Okay.

19:51.507 --> 19:54.309
Come on.

20:03.126 --> 20:05.000
Hey, where are you going?

20:05.194 --> 20:06.461
Where do you think?

20:06.496 --> 20:08.430
Trying to get this over with
so I can clear out of here.

20:08.464 --> 20:10.565
Well, you might wanna try
going the right direction.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.702
- Who says I'm not?
- You can go your way if you want, but...

20:13.736 --> 20:15.737
I've been here before.

20:15.772 --> 20:18.273
Fine. You lead the way.

20:21.811 --> 20:24.379
What're you doing?
It's too far to walk.

20:24.413 --> 20:27.623
Well, Bob never said anything
about taking an ATV.

20:28.951 --> 20:30.819
You can't just take it;
that's stealing.

20:30.853 --> 20:32.954
It's not stealing.
It belongs to the Reserve.

20:32.989 --> 20:35.323
- I'm just borrowing it.
- That's not the point.

20:35.358 --> 20:37.058
You said you wanted
to get out of here, right?

20:37.093 --> 20:38.994
- Yeah. So?
- So this'll save us some time.

20:39.028 --> 20:41.930
Besides, no one's using it.

20:41.964 --> 20:43.465
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

20:43.499 --> 20:45.700
Fine. Walk if you want.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.430
Wait.

20:54.377 --> 20:57.045
If you're gonna do this,
at least use a helmet.

21:06.382 --> 21:10.058
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

21:17.733 --> 21:19.701
Hold on!

21:23.272 --> 21:25.907
- Woo-hoo! Yeah!
- Hey, slow down!

21:25.942 --> 21:28.009
Chill out,
I know what I'm doing!

21:28.044 --> 21:29.945
Georgie, I think you're going too fast!

21:29.979 --> 21:33.548
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

21:37.053 --> 21:40.622
- Woo-hoo!
- Yeah, this is a blast! Woo!

21:48.064 --> 21:50.765
He's emaciated.

21:54.871 --> 21:58.274
Looks like he damaged a tendon
in his wing.

21:58.294 --> 21:59.527
It's all right.

21:59.547 --> 22:01.960
He could possibly need
some surgery.

22:02.478 --> 22:05.847
- Is he gonna be okay?
- If the surgery goes well,

22:05.882 --> 22:08.483
I'd say his chances
are pretty good.

22:08.517 --> 22:09.818
But that's all we can do
for him here,

22:09.852 --> 22:11.453
so we should take him back
with us.

22:11.487 --> 22:14.589
- Okay. You got him?
- Yeah.

22:14.624 --> 22:17.559
Okay, got the cage ready.

22:17.593 --> 22:19.274
Okay.

22:20.930 --> 22:24.759
Okay. Yeah, easy, boy... easy.

22:25.234 --> 22:27.035
- There you go.
- Easy...

22:29.405 --> 22:31.239
Okay.

22:32.842 --> 22:35.911
Can you hold that?

22:37.380 --> 22:39.447
There we go.

22:42.018 --> 22:45.754
Well, it's gonna be dark soon.

22:45.788 --> 22:47.122
Probably take the shortcut?

22:47.156 --> 22:49.291
Yeah, I think that's
our best bet.

22:49.325 --> 22:50.759
Unless you wanna spend
the night under the stars.

22:50.793 --> 22:52.594
Oh, I can think of worse things.

22:53.963 --> 22:56.665
Oh, hi, guys!

22:56.699 --> 22:59.768
Oh! You were gone
a long time!

22:59.802 --> 23:01.903
We got a little carried away,
didn't we, Katie?

23:01.938 --> 23:04.539
Mommy, I got you a present!

23:04.573 --> 23:07.636
Really. What is it?

23:09.145 --> 23:11.613
Oh! I was talking to Katie's
ballet teacher today, and...

23:11.647 --> 23:13.815
Really. Uh...

23:13.849 --> 23:16.351
Lisa, you knew I was planning
on making this for Katie.

23:16.385 --> 23:19.921
Yes. Yes I did.
And you're right. Um, I...

23:19.956 --> 23:21.923
I looked at your crazy schedule
and I just thought...

23:21.958 --> 23:23.425
Lisa, I don't mean to be harsh,

23:23.459 --> 23:27.762
but I would really prefer if...
if you take this back.

23:27.797 --> 23:31.032
Oh, come on. Don't you think
that's being a little ridiculous?

23:31.067 --> 23:32.504
I'm just trying to help.

23:32.524 --> 23:35.196
I'm sorry, but that's not
what it feels like right now.

23:35.216 --> 23:37.716
- You are not...
- What's going on in here?

23:37.736 --> 23:38.981
Katie, honey, can you please stop?

23:39.001 --> 23:41.910
I'm gonna get some air.
I need to take a drive.

23:41.944 --> 23:44.546
Katie, Mommy said stop!

23:44.580 --> 23:48.350
No! I don't want you!
I want Lisa!

23:58.228 --> 24:01.696
- Why are you stopping?
- I didn't.

24:04.047 --> 24:05.648
I don't believe this.

24:06.702 --> 24:09.504
- What happened?
- I-I don't know.

24:09.538 --> 24:10.972
You must have done something.

24:11.007 --> 24:14.342
No, I didn't!
The motor, it just died.

24:14.377 --> 24:17.645
Yeah, because it's out of gas.
You didn't check it?

24:17.680 --> 24:20.515
No, I didn't know
I was supposed to.

24:20.549 --> 24:23.351
Well, this totally sucks. Now what?

24:23.386 --> 24:26.688
I don't know! You tell me.
You're good at that!

24:31.460 --> 24:36.331
- Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no!
- Oh man, we're in so much trouble.

24:36.365 --> 24:38.096
No.

24:51.514 --> 24:53.481
Just hold up a second here.

24:53.516 --> 24:56.087
What's wrong?

24:57.019 --> 24:59.599
We should have been
at the road by now.

25:00.623 --> 25:02.850
I'm gonna check the map.

25:13.969 --> 25:15.603
- Whoa!
- Hey, whoa!

25:15.638 --> 25:17.739
Harley!

25:17.773 --> 25:21.609
Harley! Oh! It's steep! No!
Agghhh!

25:25.481 --> 25:26.923
Ty!

25:33.028 --> 25:34.629
Ty, hold on.

25:34.791 --> 25:37.111
I'm coming to get you.

25:46.322 --> 25:47.756
I know.

25:47.776 --> 25:49.443
Hey, Bear.

25:50.946 --> 25:53.547
Okay. I need you to do
something for me, all right?

25:53.582 --> 25:57.151
It's okay. It's all right.
Good boy. Whoa.

25:59.731 --> 26:01.389
Good boy.

26:01.623 --> 26:05.092
Okay. You're gonna help us,
all right?

26:05.126 --> 26:07.027
You can do it.

26:09.598 --> 26:13.665
Good boy. You're a good boy.

26:14.402 --> 26:19.212
Okay, stand nice and easy now.
Easy... It's okay.

26:19.875 --> 26:21.175
Easy...

26:21.209 --> 26:22.843
Easy...

26:24.579 --> 26:26.490
Easy...

26:30.418 --> 26:32.786
Ty, I'm coming! Hang on!

26:39.194 --> 26:41.528
Okay, Bear, come on.

26:41.563 --> 26:43.530
Good boy.

26:43.565 --> 26:46.100
Good boy. Come on.

26:48.970 --> 26:52.606
Come on. That's it, that's it!

26:52.641 --> 26:54.842
Good boy!

27:01.850 --> 27:03.884
Ty! Hey.

27:03.919 --> 27:06.954
Hey, it's okay.
Whoa, Bear! Whoa.

27:06.988 --> 27:08.689
Okay, come on. You're okay.

27:08.723 --> 27:11.025
Ow, my head is killing me.

27:11.059 --> 27:13.494
Oh, yeah, you got a...
You got a good bump there.

27:13.528 --> 27:16.430
- Yeah, ahh...
- It's okay, it's not bleeding.

27:16.464 --> 27:18.699
Does anywhere else hurt?

27:18.733 --> 27:20.634
- No.
- You sure?

27:20.669 --> 27:23.470
- Yeah. I'm good.
- Okay. We're gonna get you outta here.

27:23.505 --> 27:27.408
- Okay.
- Hey, no. You stay right here, all right?

27:27.442 --> 27:29.843
I'm gonna go back up first and
I'll send you down the line.

27:29.878 --> 27:32.079
- Okay.
- All right?

27:32.113 --> 27:33.380
Yeah.

27:33.415 --> 27:34.982
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:35.016 --> 27:36.684
- Be careful.
- I will.

27:38.086 --> 27:40.487
Hey, Bear,
come on.

27:40.522 --> 27:42.690
Back, Bear!

27:49.468 --> 27:50.712
That's it, Bear!

27:50.732 --> 27:53.334
- Careful, Amy!
- Come on! Back!

27:54.769 --> 27:56.870
Back, Bear.

27:56.905 --> 27:58.541
Back!

27:59.407 --> 28:01.041
My dad is gonna kill me!

28:01.076 --> 28:03.744
I could be charged with theft
or property damage.

28:03.778 --> 28:06.347
My whole future's on the line, here!

28:06.381 --> 28:08.749
And it's your fault.
I told you not to take it!

28:08.783 --> 28:11.285
It's not like I forced you!

28:11.319 --> 28:12.953
Bob's going to freak!

28:12.988 --> 28:15.622
No, he won't.
He's actually kind of cool.

28:15.657 --> 28:16.991
Yeah, right. Like you know
anything about him.

28:17.025 --> 28:20.561
Actually, I do.
My friend Ty used to work here.

28:20.595 --> 28:22.296
I looked after a wolf puppy
for him, once,

28:22.330 --> 28:25.991
and right now, Ty's rescuing
an eagle for Bob.

28:26.868 --> 28:28.268
People only see
three basic colours,

28:28.303 --> 28:32.539
but eagles see five. It helps
them when they're hunting.

28:32.574 --> 28:36.410
- Why do you always do that?
- Do what?

28:36.444 --> 28:37.678
Act like a "stuck-up
know-it-all"

28:37.712 --> 28:39.046
or "a total control freak"?

28:39.080 --> 28:41.515
- You heard me.
- That, and a lot more.

28:41.549 --> 28:45.019
- You were spying on me?
- As if. Get over yourself.

28:45.053 --> 28:47.488
You must've hit the "talk" button
on your walkie by mistake.

28:47.522 --> 28:51.558
Look, I'm really sorry. I shouldn't
have said any of that stuff.

28:51.593 --> 28:55.362
I know what it's like to be
talked about behind your back.

28:55.397 --> 28:57.226
Yeah, it sucks.

28:58.133 --> 29:02.403
But you aren't totally wrong. I
am some of those things, but...

29:02.437 --> 29:03.804
hey, you're some of them
yourself.

29:03.838 --> 29:05.506
You can be pretty bossy
sometimes, and...

29:05.540 --> 29:07.574
I'm not a stuck-up know-it-all!

29:07.609 --> 29:12.190
No, you're not.
Neither am I. Not really.

29:12.714 --> 29:14.848
I don't-I just...
I can't help it.

29:14.883 --> 29:17.451
When I'm nervous,
I start spewing random facts.

29:17.485 --> 29:19.427
It's... it's part of my charm.

29:22.902 --> 29:24.577
Oh, no.

29:29.870 --> 29:31.665
You ready?

29:32.935 --> 29:35.107
Here, Bear. Here.

29:38.173 --> 29:40.574
Good boy. Whoa...

29:40.608 --> 29:42.943
Got it!

29:45.380 --> 29:48.682
- You sure you can do this?
- Yeah, I'm good.

29:48.716 --> 29:53.687
Okay. Back, Bear. Back. Back.

29:53.721 --> 29:56.590
Back. Good boy. Back.

29:56.624 --> 29:59.493
All right.

30:01.830 --> 30:03.597
- Back.
- Okay.

30:03.631 --> 30:07.084
Back, Bear. Back. Back.

30:07.902 --> 30:09.803
- All right.
- Back.

30:09.838 --> 30:13.373
Good boy.

30:13.408 --> 30:15.742
Good boy! Whoa... Whoa...

30:15.777 --> 30:18.712
Okay.

30:18.746 --> 30:20.180
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.

30:20.215 --> 30:21.982
- Whoa... whoa!
- Okay.

30:22.016 --> 30:23.517
Oh, it's all right, it's okay.

30:23.551 --> 30:25.085
- Yeah.
- I got you.

30:30.592 --> 30:33.060
Someone has something
they wanna say to you.

30:33.474 --> 30:36.730
I'm sorry that I hurt
your feelings, Mommy.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.100
Mmm...

30:41.836 --> 30:44.138
I'm sorry too, sweetheart.

30:44.172 --> 30:46.073
Thank you.

30:51.212 --> 30:52.412
So where'd Lisa go?

30:52.447 --> 30:55.372
Oh, well, she went back
to her place for a bit

30:55.392 --> 30:57.985
to give everyone a little space.

30:58.019 --> 31:00.554
I am screwing everything up.

31:03.023 --> 31:06.460
Now don't put too much stock
into what Katie said.

31:06.494 --> 31:08.295
It wasn't about Lisa.

31:08.329 --> 31:11.832
She just wants to get her
own way like every other kid.

31:11.866 --> 31:16.136
Well, I am a little jealous of the
relationship she has with Lisa,

31:16.171 --> 31:18.071
and I know it's silly.

31:18.106 --> 31:22.776
You know, Katie is lucky.
Lisa is so good to her.

31:22.810 --> 31:25.646
Maybe a little too good at times.

31:25.680 --> 31:29.883
It just means that you're the one
that has to make all the tough calls.

31:29.918 --> 31:34.488
You know, being a parent can
be a thankless job sometimes.

31:34.522 --> 31:36.356
The way I see it,

31:36.391 --> 31:40.494
it's not about doing more
or even doing everything right.

31:40.528 --> 31:42.062
It's about showing up,

31:42.096 --> 31:46.567
being there for your kids
day in and day out.

31:46.601 --> 31:49.636
Yeah, you're right.
But that's... that's it.

31:49.671 --> 31:51.972
I haven't been here.
I've been too busy

31:52.006 --> 31:54.675
and I'm relying on you
and Lisa too much,

31:54.709 --> 31:56.977
and this just proves it.

31:57.011 --> 32:00.013
You know, maybe I'm no good
at this... on my own.

32:00.048 --> 32:02.616
Well, that's where
you're wrong, Lou.

32:02.650 --> 32:04.418
You and the girls are getting
pretty used to

32:04.452 --> 32:06.353
not having Peter around
that much.

32:06.387 --> 32:10.891
Sure, Peter was away a lot,
but we were still a unit.

32:10.925 --> 32:13.760
It feels different now, Grandpa.

32:13.795 --> 32:15.996
I'm on my own.

32:16.030 --> 32:19.032
I'm officially a single parent...

32:19.067 --> 32:23.337
and it is... way harder
than I thought it would be.

32:28.109 --> 32:29.876
I thought I was pretty clear
about hoofing it.

32:29.911 --> 32:31.678
So what's the deal taking the ATV?

32:35.516 --> 32:37.751
The whole thing was my idea.

32:37.785 --> 32:39.519
No, that's not true.
It was my fault.

32:39.554 --> 32:43.457
It was a stupid thing to do,
and I'm really, really sorry.

32:43.491 --> 32:45.792
I don't know what happened.
I saw it and I-I took it.

32:45.827 --> 32:47.928
If one of you guys got hurt,
that'd be on me, okay?

32:47.962 --> 32:50.430
I am busting my butt off just
trying to keep this place open.

32:50.465 --> 32:53.400
Something like this
could shut it down for good.

32:53.434 --> 32:54.835
Do you understand that?

32:54.869 --> 32:57.204
If you could just give me
another chance,

32:57.238 --> 33:00.674
I promise I won't do anything
stupid again. I promise.

33:02.076 --> 33:04.611
Okay. Fine.

33:04.646 --> 33:06.647
You guys were lucky this time,

33:06.681 --> 33:08.382
but you have to respect
the rules around here.

33:08.416 --> 33:11.618
It's non-negotiable. We clear?

33:11.653 --> 33:13.720
Give me your helmets.

33:16.491 --> 33:18.392
Unbelievable.

33:27.174 --> 33:28.799
Thank you for calling.

33:28.973 --> 33:30.070
Look, Lisa...

33:30.104 --> 33:33.073
I've been leaning on you
and Grandpa a lot lately,

33:33.407 --> 33:36.643
and, uh, the truth is, I don't
know what I would do without you.

33:36.677 --> 33:40.213
So... I don't tell you that
enough. Thank you.

33:40.247 --> 33:43.116
- You know we love to help.
- I know you do, but...

33:43.150 --> 33:46.319
I've been taking it
for granted. I'm sorry.

33:46.354 --> 33:47.821
Well, I appreciate you saying that,

33:47.855 --> 33:51.725
because it was me that went
too far. I overstepped,

33:51.759 --> 33:53.660
and it's not the first time.

33:55.162 --> 33:58.064
I had no business buying
that costume and it...

33:58.099 --> 33:59.499
I'm happy to take it back if it...

33:59.533 --> 34:01.101
if you wanna make a new one.

34:01.135 --> 34:03.803
It's beautiful. It really is,

34:03.838 --> 34:07.173
and Katie loves it, so...
thank you.

34:07.208 --> 34:08.875
That's the best part
of being a godmother.

34:08.909 --> 34:11.777
I can spoil her and then I don't
suffer any of the consequences,

34:11.812 --> 34:14.280
which isn't really fair to you,
so...

34:14.315 --> 34:17.717
I'm gonna rein it in a little bit.

34:17.752 --> 34:21.054
But you know that I didn't buy
that dress just for Katie, right?

34:21.088 --> 34:23.623
- What do you mean?
- Well, I bought it for you, too, Lou.

34:23.658 --> 34:27.092
I mean, I couldn't do
what you're doing every day.

34:27.128 --> 34:29.029
And I know you're trying
to adjust still,

34:29.063 --> 34:32.732
but you're doing a really
great job, Lou, you are,

34:32.766 --> 34:34.967
and those girls are thriving.

34:35.002 --> 34:39.844
I think you could relax
and really enjoy that.

34:40.373 --> 34:43.009
- Thank you.
- I want you to squeeze one more thing

34:43.043 --> 34:45.277
into that busy schedule
of yours.

34:45.312 --> 34:47.013
What?

34:47.047 --> 34:49.248
A little Lou time.

34:58.159 --> 35:00.160
Well, he seems to be doing okay.

35:00.194 --> 35:02.762
And how are you?

35:02.797 --> 35:04.798
Hey, hey...
I'm all right. I'm all right.

35:04.832 --> 35:06.299
I just need...
I just need a minute.

35:06.333 --> 35:09.002
- Okay, you need rest.
- Oh, yeah.

35:09.036 --> 35:12.205
And to eat something.

35:16.744 --> 35:19.112
Here.

35:21.215 --> 35:24.017
Let me take the trail mix.

35:24.051 --> 35:26.352
Okay.

35:28.756 --> 35:31.357
- Oh man...
- Still no service.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.994
- Yeah, lie down.
- Yeah.

35:38.766 --> 35:41.067
Watch your head.

35:41.102 --> 35:42.869
'Kay.

35:42.903 --> 35:45.338
Amy, it's me again.
Are you guys okay?

35:45.372 --> 35:46.673
I thought you were coming
for dinner.

35:46.707 --> 35:48.308
Just call me back.

35:48.342 --> 35:51.878
Okay, Bob. I'll keep you in the loop.

35:51.912 --> 35:53.813
Well, they are not at the trailer

35:53.848 --> 35:55.885
and Bob hasn't heard from 'em.

35:55.905 --> 35:58.651
Neither has Scott, and Amy's cell just
keeps going straight to voice-mail.

35:58.686 --> 36:01.688
Well, it's probably outta cell range.

36:01.722 --> 36:04.023
Do you think we could reach
them if we had walkie-talkies?

36:04.058 --> 36:06.226
I heard they're more reliable
than in emergencies,

36:06.260 --> 36:09.763
because they us radio frequencies
and not cell towers.

36:09.797 --> 36:11.164
Well, that is good thinking,

36:11.198 --> 36:13.299
but they have a limited range too,

36:13.334 --> 36:16.469
and it'd probably be worse
in the mountains.

36:16.504 --> 36:18.138
We have to do something.

36:18.172 --> 36:20.974
Well, there's no point in
getting all worked up about it.

36:21.008 --> 36:24.410
Maybe it got late
and they decided to stay put.

36:24.445 --> 36:26.179
Katie's fast asleep.

36:26.213 --> 36:30.301
Ty. Hey.

36:31.799 --> 36:34.154
Come on, it's been a couple hours.

36:34.188 --> 36:36.322
All right.

36:36.357 --> 36:39.058
- Is it time for more questions?
- Yes.

36:39.093 --> 36:41.928
You could have a concussion.

36:41.962 --> 36:44.898
So... do you remember
what happened?

36:44.932 --> 36:47.767
I uh...

36:47.802 --> 36:49.702
I think I fell down a cliff.

36:49.737 --> 36:51.638
Yes, you did.

36:53.340 --> 36:59.112
And then this beautiful woman
rappelled down and saved me.

36:59.146 --> 37:00.847
- Do you know where she went?
- Hey!

37:00.881 --> 37:02.982
Okay, you can go back to bed.

37:03.017 --> 37:06.319
Okay, good.

37:07.922 --> 37:10.957
All right. You got enough
blanket there?

37:29.679 --> 37:31.644
- Ty?
- Over here.

37:34.682 --> 37:36.049
He's doing pretty good.

37:36.083 --> 37:38.251
- You seem better.
- Well, I feel it.

37:38.285 --> 37:41.788
The bump's still there, but...

37:41.822 --> 37:43.890
it hurts a lot less.

37:43.924 --> 37:46.092
You shoulda seen the other guy.

37:46.126 --> 37:50.964
- We should probably head out.
- Yeah, we need to find cell service.

38:00.674 --> 38:02.942
Hello?

38:02.977 --> 38:06.079
Oh my god, Amy!
Where are you guys?

38:07.897 --> 38:09.849
He what?

38:10.243 --> 38:11.918
Is he okay?

38:12.476 --> 38:14.721
Okay, good. Uh...

38:14.934 --> 38:17.375
Okay. Yup, we'll see you soon.

38:17.661 --> 38:19.452
They're fine.
Uh, they lost light

38:19.472 --> 38:21.550
so they decided to stay put.

38:21.570 --> 38:22.629
Well, smart move.

38:22.663 --> 38:25.212
- Uh, but Ty had a bit of a fall.
- A fall?

38:25.232 --> 38:27.300
Yes, apparently he's okay,
but they're stopping off

38:27.334 --> 38:30.403
at the doctor's on the way home
just to be safe.

38:43.150 --> 38:45.151
You two really had us worried.

38:45.185 --> 38:48.621
- It was kind of a crazy night.
- What'd Dr. Virani say?

38:48.655 --> 38:50.790
She said I married the
greatest woman in the world.

38:50.824 --> 38:53.092
Hey, be serious.

38:53.126 --> 38:55.828
I'm fine, I'm fine. I just have
to take it easy for a few days.

38:55.862 --> 38:57.563
So how's the eagle?

38:57.597 --> 38:59.065
Good. Bob picked him up in town,

38:59.099 --> 39:00.666
but he's doing pretty well,
all things considered.

39:00.701 --> 39:02.716
That's awesome! I'm gonna
go unload the horses.

39:02.736 --> 39:03.650
Okay.

39:03.670 --> 39:06.605
Oh, thanks, Jack.

39:08.141 --> 39:09.508
I'm so glad you guys are safe.

39:09.543 --> 39:12.211
Hey, thanks for making us
take that picnic.

39:12.245 --> 39:14.413
Pfft! It hardly turned out to be the
romantic day I hoped you'd have.

39:14.448 --> 39:16.382
Well, it definitely got us
through the night.

39:16.416 --> 39:18.184
You always take care
of everyone,

39:18.218 --> 39:20.419
even when you don't know it.

39:20.454 --> 39:23.322
Come here. Thank you.

39:32.923 --> 39:34.400
Here is.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.340
Okay, so what else are
we bringing on our picnic?

39:36.360 --> 39:40.558
- My tambourine!
- Okay, well you better get it then.

39:40.592 --> 39:42.894
- Hey!
- Hey!

39:42.928 --> 39:44.662
Have you heard anything
about the eagle?

39:44.696 --> 39:46.431
Yeah. The surgery went really well

39:46.465 --> 39:48.766
and Bob thinks he'll make
a full recovery.

39:48.786 --> 39:49.878
Awesome!

39:49.898 --> 39:52.036
Hey, uh, do you wanna come
with me and Katie on a picnic.

39:52.070 --> 39:53.771
Uh, no, I got some stuff to do.

39:53.806 --> 39:57.708
Okay. Guess it's just me
and Katie then.

39:57.743 --> 40:00.478
Okay, honey, let's go!

40:00.512 --> 40:04.482
So, it sounds like that roper
came in pretty handy out there.

40:04.516 --> 40:07.452
He was incredible, Grandpa.

40:07.486 --> 40:09.787
Actually, I've been thinking...

40:11.256 --> 40:13.925
Bear might make a good police horse.

40:13.959 --> 40:15.827
I checked out the application
process online,

40:15.861 --> 40:17.962
and he's exactly
what they look for.

40:17.996 --> 40:20.064
You really think he's made
of that kind of stuff?

40:20.098 --> 40:21.699
Well, he has the right temperament.

40:21.733 --> 40:23.801
He doesn't spook at anything.

40:23.836 --> 40:25.736
He's a special horse.

40:25.771 --> 40:28.072
I-I knew that before,
when he led us to Buddy,

40:28.106 --> 40:31.175
but when Ty was lying out there
and...

40:32.845 --> 40:34.712
I just couldn't have done it
without him.

40:34.746 --> 40:37.181
Well, then, I say go for it.

40:39.485 --> 40:41.519
What?

40:41.553 --> 40:43.688
You're something else,
you know that?

40:43.722 --> 40:45.289
You just never stop.

41:03.942 --> 41:06.444
- Need a hand?
- No, thanks, Grandpa, I'm good.

41:06.478 --> 41:08.412
- There you go.
- Okay, we won't be long.

41:08.447 --> 41:10.840
Have fun! Bye!

41:13.485 --> 41:17.688
- Are we finally alone?
- By golly, I think we are.

41:17.723 --> 41:19.690
You know what time it is?

41:19.725 --> 41:23.561
- Yes! It's five o'clock somewhere.
- Yes it is.

41:23.595 --> 41:26.664
Oh, Jack, listen.

41:26.698 --> 41:28.165
To what?

41:28.200 --> 41:30.167
Exactly.

41:39.478 --> 41:41.779
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What part of take it easy

41:41.813 --> 41:43.604
don't you understand?

41:43.624 --> 41:46.517
I feel fine, Amy. I'm just hanging
up some light fixtures upstairs.

41:46.552 --> 41:48.619
What, on a ladder? Really?

41:48.654 --> 41:51.222
I'm sitting around
and I'm going crazy up there.

41:51.256 --> 41:54.992
Okay, but I still think
you should be lying down.

41:55.027 --> 41:57.929
- Really?
- Doctor Virani's orders.

41:59.923 --> 42:03.434
Oh. Well, if the doctor
ordered me to lie down,

42:03.468 --> 42:06.037
- I should probably lie down.
- I think so.

42:10.876 --> 42:13.344
That sounded pretty good.

42:13.378 --> 42:16.781
Hey, do want Mommy to show you
a thumb roll?

42:16.815 --> 42:19.617
Okay. Hold it like this.

42:19.651 --> 42:21.752
You gotta get your thumb wet.
Ready?

42:25.857 --> 42:27.925
That's cool! Let me try!

42:27.960 --> 42:30.761
All right. You wanna hold it
in your left hand.

42:30.796 --> 42:33.064
You don't wanna press too hard
with your thumb.

42:33.098 --> 42:34.498
Oh!

42:34.533 --> 42:36.500
Nice!

42:38.103 --> 42:39.470
Georgie!

42:39.504 --> 42:42.974
Hey. I thought you had
stuff to do.

42:43.008 --> 42:45.242
Well, Katie and I are just glad
you're here.

42:45.277 --> 42:47.011
Aren't we, Katie?

42:47.045 --> 42:49.747
- You hungry?
- Starving.

42:49.781 --> 42:51.949
- This has got your name on it.
- Thank you.

42:51.984 --> 42:55.052
Hey, you know, I never got a chance
to ask you about the Reserve.

42:55.087 --> 42:56.621
- How did it go?
- Okay.

42:56.655 --> 42:58.756
Actually, pretty educational.

42:58.790 --> 43:01.726
- Yeah? Tell me about it.
- Maybe later.

43:01.760 --> 43:05.029
Georgie, do you know how
to do a thumb roll?

43:05.063 --> 43:07.565
- What's that?
- Mommy, show her!

43:07.599 --> 43:09.600
All right. Ready?

43:12.337 --> 43:13.804
That's so cool!
How do you do that?

43:13.839 --> 43:15.106
All right. Hold out your hand,

43:15.140 --> 43:17.908
nice and easy, not too tight.

43:17.943 --> 43:20.511
You wanna cross your thumb softly
around the edge.

43:20.545 --> 43:22.647
Oh, I think
Katie better show you how.

43:22.681 --> 43:25.383
She's really good at it.
'Kay.

43:25.417 --> 43:27.585
Wanna try again, Katie?

43:27.619 --> 43:30.521
All right, you try again.
