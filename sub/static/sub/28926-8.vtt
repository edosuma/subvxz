I'm sorry, have my translation skills
been letting you down?

Let's get her on this side, on this side.

-Easy, easy, easy, easy.
-[Robin] It's, uh...

01:12.155 --> 01:15.075
You know, it's not actually that bad.
There was a...

01:15.158 --> 01:17.285
The goalie on my soccer team,
Beth Wildfire,

01:17.368 --> 01:19.496
this other girl slid into her leg,

01:19.579 --> 01:21.873

-Robin.

-[sobs] Okay.
-[Jonathan] Need you to stay real still.

04:20.593 --> 04:23.429
[Mike] The Mind Flayer,
it built this monster in Hawkins,

04:23.721 --> 04:26.557
to stop El, to kill her
and pave a way into our world.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.477
[Nancy] And it almost did.
That was just one tiny piece of it.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.020
[Hopper] How big is this thing?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.522
[Jonathan] It's big. [murmurs]

04:32.897 --> 04:35.024
-Thirty feet, at least.
-[Lucas] Yeah.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.943
It sorta destroyed your cabin.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.695
Sorry.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.780
Okay, so, just to be clear, this...

04:40.863 --> 04:44.450
this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El,

04:44.534 --> 04:47.537
it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?

04:47.620 --> 04:50.039
-Yes.
-But instead of, like, screws and metal,

04:50.123 --> 04:51.958
the Mind Flayer made its weapon...

04:52.500 --> 04:53.543
with melted people.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.420
-Yes, exactly.
-[Steve] Yeah, okay.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.879
I-- Yeah, I'm just making sure.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.049
Are we sure this thing is still out there,
still alive?

05:00.133 --> 05:02.927
El beat the shit out of it,
but, yeah, it's still alive.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.555
-But if we close the gate again--
-We cut the brain off from the body.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.639
And kill it.

05:07.098 --> 05:07.932
Theoretically.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.018
[Murray] Yoo-hoo!

05:10.101 --> 05:11.519
[papers rustling]

05:11.602 --> 05:12.770
Yoo-hoo!

05:14.397 --> 05:17.025
Okay, this is what Alexei called
"the hub."

05:17.108 --> 05:19.110
Now, the hub takes us to the vault room.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.695
Okay, where's the gate?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.947
Right here.
I don't know the scale on this,

05:23.031 --> 05:25.241
but I think it's fairly close
to the vault room,

05:25.325 --> 05:27.035
maybe 50 feet or so.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.328
More like 500.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.206
What, you're just gonna waltz in there
like it's commie Disneyland or something?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.750
I'm sorry, who are you?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.501
Erica Sinclair. Who are you?

Murray...

05:37.253 --> 05:38.087
Bauman.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.881
Listen, Mr. Bunman,

05:39.964 --> 05:41.841
I'm not trying to tell you
how to do things,

05:41.924 --> 05:44.927
but I've been down in that shithole
for 24 hours.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.097
And with all due respect,
you do what this man tells you,

05:48.181 --> 05:49.307
you're all gonna die.

05:49.390 --> 05:53.061
I'm sorry, why is this four-year-old
speaking to me?

05:53.144 --> 05:55.563
Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard!

05:55.646 --> 05:57.315
-Erica!
-Just the facts!

05:57.398 --> 06:00.943
She's right. You're all gonna die,
but you don't have to. Excuse me.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.570
-Sorry, may I?
-Please.

06:04.739 --> 06:08.117
Okay, see this room here?
This is a storage facility.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.245
There's a hatch in here that feeds
into their underground ventilation system.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.415
That will lead you to the base
of the weapon.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.917
It's a bit of a maze down there,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.586
but between me and Erica,
we can show you the way.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.213
You can show us the way?

06:20.296 --> 06:22.924
Don't worry, you can do all the fighting
and the dangerous hero shit,

06:23.007 --> 06:24.008
and we'll just be your...

06:24.926 --> 06:25.885
navigators.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.095
No.

06:29.889 --> 06:30.723
Nope.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.062
[cocks assault rifle]

06:40.608 --> 06:42.443
[Erica] Well, that settles it.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.821
He's gonna die. They're gonna die.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.948
Yep, most likely.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.074
You guys survived.

06:48.699 --> 06:49.575
Barely.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.661
We could've really used you guys
down there.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.871
Could've used you up here, too.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.207
Yeah, man. We missed you, dude.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.626
Yeah. Big-time.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.337
I missed you guys, too.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.588
Big-time.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.590
Please don't cry, nerds.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.510
-Erica.
-Keep saying my name, see what happens.

07:07.593 --> 07:11.222
Hey, heads up. You can navigate,
just from someplace safe.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.099
-It's not that simple.
-The signal won't reach.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.726
Not with this. You need something
with a high enough frequency band

07:15.810 --> 07:17.311
to relay with the Russians' radio tower.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.064
But for that to work, you need someone
who has both seen their comms room

07:20.148 --> 07:22.900
and has access to a super-powered
handcrafted radio tower,

07:22.984 --> 07:26.237
one preferably already situated
at the highest point in Hawkins.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.155
Oh, wait.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.489
That's me.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.408
If you want us to navigate, you got us.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.742
But we need a head start.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.788
And a car.

["Goldrush" by Yello playing]

Oh, man, now this...

this is what I'm talkin' about!

07:45.214 --> 07:47.425
-"Toddfather"?
-[Steve] Oh, screw Todd!

07:47.508 --> 07:48.843
Steve's her daddy now.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.387
[Robin] Did you just talk about yourself
in the third person?

07:51.471 --> 07:54.223
-Did he just call himself daddy?
-All right, where are we going?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.600
-Weathertop.
-Weather-what?

07:55.683 --> 07:57.477
-Just drive.
-Okay. Jesus!

Listen to me, I need to end this,

08:18.789 --> 08:21.250
but I will be back before you know it,
okay?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.712
-I don't know, Mom.
-No, listen. You're gonna be safe there.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.797
It's-- It's far away from all this.

08:27.089 --> 08:30.551
You just stick close to your brother
and-- and do whatever he says.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.886
No matter what. Okay?

08:31.969 --> 08:34.805
I'm not worried about me, Mom,
I'm worried about you.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.683
Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.769
Okay? I'm gonna be fine.

08:41.938 --> 08:42.855
Okay, Mom.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.982

08:45.066 --> 08:46.692
-I'm gonna be fine.
-Okay.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.403

-My battery's low, but...
-[Will] You're suffocating me.

08:53.407 --> 08:54.951
...it will recharge.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.369
I know it will, kid.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.620
I know.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.205
I can fight.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.874
Better than any of us.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.085
But right now,

09:04.710 --> 09:05.962
I need you safe.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.465
This thing is after you.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.842
It's not after me.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.972
Do you understand?

09:17.682 --> 09:18.724
Hey...

09:21.102 --> 09:22.562
I need you to understand.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.025
[Hopper, quietly] Okay?

09:28.109 --> 09:28.943
[Mike] Hey.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.736
We should probably go.

[Hopper murmurs]

09:52.049 --> 09:52.925

Be careful.

[sighs]

10:11.319 --> 10:12.278
What?

10:14.655 --> 10:17.199
It's a two-man operation. Two!

10:17.283 --> 10:19.910
-Yeah, well, change of plans.
-Change of plans?

10:19.994 --> 10:23.080
-Yeah. Will you explain it to him, please?
-We have two options here, Jim.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.166
We can turn the machine off,
or we can explode it.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.293
-Oh, yeah, says who?
-Says the man who built it!

10:27.376 --> 10:30.087
-Yeah, and we wanna explode it!
-Or else our heroic efforts

10:30.171 --> 10:31.005
will be for naught!

10:31.088 --> 10:33.299
This is a three-man operation, Jim,
not two.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.051
-Yeah, three.

Didn't your mom just buy this car?

11:03.537 --> 11:05.164
Yes. I'm sure it's fine.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.832
-Did you leave the lights on?
-No.

Welcome to Hawkins, Indiana,

55:58.480 --> 55:59.814
a wonderful place to grow up,

56:00.482 --> 56:02.025
to raise your family,

56:02.108 --> 56:03.651
to walk your dog.

56:03.735 --> 56:05.153
-But then...
-[sirens wailing]

56:05.236 --> 56:08.782
...on July Fourth,
everything changed.

56:09.032 --> 56:11.451
A terrible tragedy struck
this small town.

56:13.078 --> 56:16.623
But this was not this small town's
first brush with tragedy.

56:17.207 --> 56:19.918
Mysterious deaths, government cover-ups,

56:20.460 --> 56:22.253

56:22.462 --> 56:23.463
Is it all linked?

56:23.546 --> 56:26.007
All a vast conspiracy?

56:26.091 --> 56:28.093
The fault of a disgraced,
corrupt mayor?

56:28.218 --> 56:31.262
Or is something more going on
in the heartland?

56:31.346 --> 56:33.890
-Can a town itself be cursed?
-[woman screams]

56:33.973 --> 56:36.142

is to blame.

-To find out,

56:38.269 --> 56:41.731

56:46.277 --> 56:47.362
[indistinct chatter]

56:49.072 --> 56:50.907
You put your mom down as a reference?

56:50.990 --> 56:53.743
Yeah. Why not?
She's, like, super well-respected.

56:54.911 --> 56:56.538
[Robin] You're such a dingus.

56:57.038 --> 56:57.872
[Steve] Wha--

56:58.623 --> 57:00.792
[Robin]  Uh, just to be clear,
we weren't fired, you know.

57:00.875 --> 57:04.045
The mall burned down and, like,
killed a bunch of people.

57:06.089 --> 57:08.007
Thanks for sharing.
Didn't know.

57:09.384 --> 57:10.718

57:10.802 --> 57:12.929
Uh...  The Apartment,

57:13.012 --> 57:15.432
Hidden Fortress, Children of Paradise.

You, go.

57:25.191 --> 57:26.234
Yeah. Uh...

57:27.402 --> 57:28.361
Star Wars.

57:28.445 --> 57:29.487
A New Hope?

57:29.571 --> 57:30.447
A new what-now?

57:30.530 --> 57:32.490
Which  Star Wars?

57:32.574 --> 57:35.034
The one with the teddy bears. Duh.
[squeals like an Ewok]

57:35.118 --> 57:38.413
No? Uh... Oh, the one that just came out.
The movie that just came out.

57:38.496 --> 57:40.790
The one with the DeLorean
and Alex P. Keaton,

57:40.874 --> 57:42.792
and he's trying to bang his mom.
[chuckles]

57:43.084 --> 57:44.127
The time...

57:45.086 --> 57:46.629
Yeah, those are my top three. Classics.

57:47.964 --> 57:48.840
You start Monday.

57:50.383 --> 57:51.509
You start never.

Will you just, um...
Will you give us a minute?

58:03.271 --> 58:05.398
All right, you have to understand, Keith,

58:05.690 --> 58:07.650
I know his taste is a bit pedestrian,

58:07.734 --> 58:10.236
but the dingus has other qualities.

58:10.320 --> 58:13.615
He's a douchebag of the highest order,
Robin.

58:13.698 --> 58:16.576
He was a bit of a prick to us
in high school, I'll grant you that,

58:16.659 --> 58:17.827
but he remains...

58:18.578 --> 58:19.662
a total chick magnet.

58:19.746 --> 58:22.373
Yeah, okay,
and this is relevant to me how?

58:22.457 --> 58:24.626
Uh, Earth to Keith.

58:24.792 --> 58:27.128
The ladies will come in just to see him.

58:27.212 --> 58:28.546
They'll come in in droves.

58:28.963 --> 58:30.173
Droves, Keith.

58:30.256 --> 58:31.966
We sold so much ice cream,

58:32.050 --> 58:34.177
they had to get a second shipment in
from Michigan.

58:34.260 --> 58:36.429
Goddamn Michigan, Keith.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.097
And these ladies... [inhales sharply]

58:38.181 --> 58:39.974
These ladies are hot.

58:40.600 --> 58:42.977
They're so very hot.

58:43.061 --> 58:45.647
And there are too many of them
for little Steve.

58:46.064 --> 58:47.315
He needs assistance.

58:47.649 --> 58:50.235
He needs  your  assistance, Keith.

58:52.487 --> 58:55.073
What's in it for you?
You got a thing for him or something?

58:56.407 --> 58:58.368

and you came into my life and...

1:07:33.466 --> 1:07:36.594
for the first time in a long time,

1:07:38.888 --> 1:07:41.057
I started to feel things again.

1:07:42.183 --> 1:07:44.101
I started to feel happy.

1:07:48.314 --> 1:07:51.275
But, lately, I guess I've been feeling...

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:54.403
distant from you.

1:07:55.780 --> 1:07:56.822
Like you're...

1:08:26.936 --> 1:08:28.312

1:08:30.481 --> 1:08:32.358
I don't want things to change.

1:08:36.529 --> 1:08:38.823

I came in here,
