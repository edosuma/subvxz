00:08.070 --> 00:09.389
mean:
Prey/ous/y on
scream...

00:09.410 --> 00:10.695
You can't do_
a slasher m_OV|e
as a tv series.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.235
Slasher movies
burn bright and fast.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.104
Nina, are you home?

00:14.110 --> 00:16.408
Noah:
By the time
the first body’s found. . .

00:16.410 --> 00:17.138
(screaming)

00:17.150 --> 00:19.710
wits only a matter of time
before the b/ooo’bath
commences.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.679
We're looking
for miss patterson's
ex-boyfriend, tyler o'neill.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.282
Maybe brandon james is back.

00:25.290 --> 00:26.143
Who's brandon james?

00:26.160 --> 00:28.583
He killed a bunch of students
20 years ago.

00:28.590 --> 00:30.114
You need to forget
it's a horror story.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.086
You have to care
if the hot //t teacher

00:32.090 --> 00:35.059
Seems a little too interested
in his female students.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.550
I feel ugly.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.889
Audrey:
You are heauuful.

00:37.900 --> 00:41.495
Noah:
You have to care
if the smart; pretty girl

00:41.500 --> 00:42.990
Forgives the dumb jock.

00:43.010 --> 00:43.999
You slept with nina.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.739
Noah:
You root for them.
You /0 ve them.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.777
So when they are
brutally murdered...

00:48.780 --> 00:50.099
(gasps)

00:50.580 --> 00:51.501
...It hurts.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.670
Everyone has secrets.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.739
Everyone tel/s lies.

00:56.150 --> 00:59.142
And everyone is fair game

01:01.720 --> 01:04.484
Unt/i theres no one left.

01:53.540 --> 01:56.475
-(cell phone ringing)
-(gasps)

01:59.980 --> 02:01.516
Hey.
Did you get home okay?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.841
Audrey: (voice distorted)
yeah, how are you doing?

02:03.850 --> 02:06.114
Uh, your voice sounds
kind of weird.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.350
Must be a had connection.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.156
How about now?

02:09.160 --> 02:10.388
Not really, but it's okay.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.881
I’ve been th/n/(Ing
about you a// night

02:12.900 --> 02:14.356
Must be a crap tv night.

02:17.870 --> 02:19.792
It's not just me.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.461
-Have you been online?
-./'gnore them.

02:21.470 --> 02:24.906
Yeah, you don't go
to a bitch-infested
catholic school.

02:24.910 --> 02:29.973
There’s a bitch infestation
at my school too, trust me.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.777
So, do you want some company?

02:31.780 --> 02:32.940
No. It's late.

02:32.950 --> 02:35.748
What if i’m already here?

02:35.750 --> 02:38.480
-(thudding)
-what was that?

02:40.090 --> 02:41.887
Audrey, that's not funny.

02:41.890 --> 02:44.984
My mom is gonna be home soon.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.055
Okay, if this is
a coming out
of the closet joke,

02:49.060 --> 02:52.598
It needs to be
significantly less creepy.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.535
Go ahead
Take a look.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.364
(sighs)

03:01.410 --> 03:03.105
Okay. You got me.

03:03.110 --> 03:05.044
-Where are you?
-(rattling)

03:05.050 --> 03:06.938
(door creaking)

03:08.650 --> 03:10.811
Audrey, you're scaring me.

03:10.820 --> 03:12.685
Just playing.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.210
Come out to our spot.

03:15.220 --> 03:17.313
Its a beautiful night.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.192
Audrey?

03:21.400 --> 03:24.119
Audrey, you're not out here.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.229
Romeo, you are certifiable.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.935
What can i say?

03:30.940 --> 03:33.238
You make me crazy.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.235
Audrey, where are you?

04:21.660 --> 04:23.252
P/per:
For aqr web radio,

04:23.260 --> 04:25.888
Welcome to_
autopsy of a crime.

04:25.890 --> 04:26.822
This Is piper shaw

04:26.830 --> 04:29.993
Podcasting
the murder in vestigation
of nine patterson,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.592
Day-by-day
as it unfolds.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.831
So, its been four days
since this brutal slaying

04:34.840 --> 04:36.569
And local shen'ff
clark hudson

04:36.570 --> 04:40.358

tyler o ’ne/ll,

04:40.380 --> 04:41.631
As a person of interest.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.676
With this town ’5
blood-soaked history,

04:43.680 --> 04:47.946
Echoes of lakewood s
homegrown psycho,
brandonjames,

04:47.950 --> 04:48.644
Are everywhere.

04:48.650 --> 04:51.039
Walking the streets,
you can hear terrified locals

04:51.050 --> 04:54.247
Wondering,
could he be back?

04:54.260 --> 04:55.386
Emma!

04:55.390 --> 04:56.357
Hey!

04:56.360 --> 04:57.611
You could answer
one of my texts.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.858
I know you're getting them.

04:58.860 --> 04:59.884
They say, "read."

04:59.900 --> 05:01.356
-Hi, riley.
-(sighs)

05:01.360 --> 05:02.759
What're you listening to?

05:02.770 --> 05:04.692
Uh, that true
crime podcast.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.167
They're covering
nina's murder.

05:06.170 --> 05:07.899
Aoc?
I'm addicted.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.390
They have, like,
a crazy huge following.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.560
I can't believe
that chick's here
talking about our nina.

05:11.570 --> 05:14.130
Oh, nina, always loved
to be the center of attention.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.836
Yeah, apparently,
even with will.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.909
Emma, wait.
Look, i'm sorry.

05:18.910 --> 05:22.812
I should not have
dropped will's indiscretion
like that at the party.

05:22.820 --> 05:25.482
No, you should've told me
when you found out.

05:25.490 --> 05:26.388
I know, i know,
i'm sorry.

05:26.390 --> 05:29.518
It's, just... You know
how nina could be
if you crossed her.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.350
I mean,
she'd terrorize you.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.328
Seriously, i was
scared of her.

05:36.730 --> 05:38.994
Em, i'm really sorry.

05:44.470 --> 05:45.402
Okay.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.833
I'm still pissed,
but you're on probation.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.729
Hey, i would do
community service for you.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.674
Iwould even_wear _
an ugly orange jumpswt
for you.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.874
(all chuckle)

05:54.880 --> 05:55.778
Well, i'm touched.

05:55.780 --> 05:59.079
Thank god, i can call off
the intervention.

05:59.090 --> 06:03.413
Hey, have you guys
gotten any weird
phone calls lately?

06:03.430 --> 06:06.786
Yeah, selling
generic sex pills from india.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.482
No, thank you.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.219
No, like creepy,
mysterious weird.

06:10.700 --> 06:11.826
I don't know.
This guy called

06:11.830 --> 06:13.923
And said something about
how we pretend to have

06:13.940 --> 06:15.066
Perfect lives online,

06:15.070 --> 06:16.537
On instagram and facebook.

06:16.540 --> 06:19.634
Well, he must be ancient
if he thinks
we're still on facebook.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.608
It's probably just
jake being a douche.

06:21.610 --> 06:22.770
Brooke: Maybe.

06:22.780 --> 06:25.408
Yeah, maybe.

06:27.650 --> 06:28.810
(indistinct talking)

06:28.820 --> 06:30.879
Sheriff hudson:
So, (sighs)

06:30.890 --> 06:31.743
Brandon james.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.183
I mean, you really think
it's healthy to have

06:33.190 --> 06:34.646
_ An obsession
With a serial killer?

06:34.660 --> 06:37.185
Brandon's actually classified
as a mass murderer.

06:37.190 --> 06:40.626
You know,
he killed them all
the same night.

06:41.460 --> 06:46.523
You ever contacted anyone
related to the events
of that evening?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.298
Halloween '94.

06:48.300 --> 06:53.602
When i was in seventh grade,
i was doing this report
on nature versus nurture,

06:53.610 --> 06:55.737
And brandon seemed like
the perfect subject.

06:55.740 --> 07:00.074
Yeah, so, i exchanged
a few e-mails
with his brother, troy.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.447
And, of course,
i've tried to identify
that mystery girl

07:03.450 --> 07:05.213
That brandon was in love with.

07:05.220 --> 07:07.040
-Well, any luck?
-No.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.381
None of my theories
panned out.

07:09.590 --> 07:11.729
You ever contacted
keVIn duval?

07:11.730 --> 07:12.981
Oh, no way!

07:13.000 --> 07:15.389
Survivor stalking
is seriously rude.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.424
Plus, emma's in my class.

07:16.430 --> 07:17.749
Not that i wouldn't
love to ask him

07:17.770 --> 07:21.069
What it was like to
just face off
against brandon james,

07:21.070 --> 07:23.868
But, you know,
boundaries.

07:23.870 --> 07:26.236
_ Plus he doesn't
live here anymore.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.402
And that.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.474
Okay, well,

07:35.480 --> 07:38.813
-I think we're done here.
-Okay. (sighs)

07:40.790 --> 07:45.625
Oh, hey, um,
thanks for saving my life.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.382
-(chuckles)
-you're welcome.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.354
So, you got
that house key?

07:51.370 --> 07:53.429
Oh, right, yeah.

07:53.870 --> 07:54.723
What was that about?

07:54.740 --> 07:56.696
I was at this thing
the other night.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.964
Some jocks dumped him
on a swim raft.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.572
No biggie.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.603
Who were the jocks?

08:05.050 --> 08:07.245
Sheriff, i'm your son.

08:07.250 --> 08:10.048
Not your
2] jump street
snitch.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.778
Thanks for the lift.

08:15.790 --> 08:19.328
I had to drink and ditch
the behemoth last night.

08:19.330 --> 08:22.049
Can't believe emma
still won't talk to me.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.666
Maybe that's a bullet
well-dodged.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.467
I mean, don't get me wrong,
emma's sweet and all,

08:27.470 --> 08:31.065
But i'm guessing
the sex was pretty amish.

08:31.070 --> 08:31.866
Jake, not helping, man!

08:31.870 --> 08:36.773
Look, the girls
just don't get how nina
was like a sexual sniper.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.476
When she targeted you,
you went down.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.472
Maybe i should try
a heartfelt apology.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.617
-Hell, yeah.
-(chuckles)

08:43.620 --> 08:47.818
Work that big smile
and that "aw, shucks" magic.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.378
(scoffs)
shut up.

08:49.390 --> 08:51.483
Just, everything
that's happened

08:51.490 --> 08:54.027
And this game on saturday,

08:54.030 --> 08:55.895
(sighs) i need her.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.754
Yo, grab some zen.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.761
Forget about
the scout from duke,

08:59.770 --> 09:00.862
Forget about emma

09:00.870 --> 09:04.636
And forget about
nina's murder.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.609
And any cyber-connection
to nina,

09:07.610 --> 09:10.477
'cause it doesn't exist.
Correct?

09:10.880 --> 09:12.472
Absolutely.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.074
We are oﬁ‘icia/ly
cerrado.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.217
That's closed.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.040
For business.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.659
(clears throat)

09:44.010 --> 09:45.648
Son of a bitch!

09:47.080 --> 09:48.718
(reading)
"i miss you nina bobina.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.870
"rest in prada.
Love, miranda."

09:50.890 --> 09:52.619
Isn't that the girl
nina fat-shamed

09:52.620 --> 09:55.088
Into some questionable
guatemalan liposuction?

09:55.090 --> 09:56.216
-Sounds like our nina.
-(scoffs)

09:56.220 --> 09:59.519
Piper: How would you
describe nina's relationship
with the other students?

09:59.530 --> 10:01.179
Teacher: As you can see,
she was loved.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.191
-Very popular.
-Yeah, yeah.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.098
Well, thank you
very much,

10:04.100 --> 10:05.761
-And have a wonderful day.
-You too.

10:05.770 --> 10:07.522
-Who's that?
-Piper: Thanks for your time.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.030
Absolutely.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.928
Hey, GUYS,
i'm piper shaw.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.168
I'm doing a story for...

10:12.170 --> 10:13.068
Autopsy of a cr/me.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.174
Yeah, your show
is completely addictive.

10:16.180 --> 10:16.999
Thank you.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.477
-Fellow crime geek.
-Totally.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.677
Uh, i'm noah foster.
This is audrey.

10:21.880 --> 10:22.710
She's shy.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.608
You look really familiar.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.941
You probably saw
my video.

10:26.960 --> 10:31.056
So, i'm trying to get past
all of the faux-bff bs

10:31.060 --> 10:34.757
And get a clear picture
of the real nina patterson.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.556
Did any of you know her?

10:35.560 --> 10:38.120
Yeah. Nina was
a stone-cold bitch

10:38.130 --> 10:40.223
Who got what she deserved.

10:41.170 --> 10:42.728
That is pretty clear.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.765
-Can i quote you on that?
-No!

10:44.770 --> 10:47.568
No, she's just
saying words.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.433
And what about you?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.772
Did you have any thoughts
on nina's murder?

10:50.780 --> 10:53.749
-You know, a few...
-Someone's ass is toast!

10:53.750 --> 10:56.878
But some other time
sounds good.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.812
-Jake: Noah!
-What's up?

10:58.820 --> 11:00.287
Was it you, nerd?

11:00.290 --> 11:01.439
Was this payback for the lake?

11:01.460 --> 11:03.815
-Was what payback?
-My truck.

11:03.830 --> 11:04.512
It went viral!

11:04.530 --> 11:06.259
-Well, i mean, you know...
-Can it, les-beast.

11:06.260 --> 11:07.158
Hey, hey,
leave him alone.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.855
-You know anything
about this?
-No.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.521
But, you know,
it is a sad statement

11:10.530 --> 11:11.895
Of the decline of
our public schools.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.299
-That's the wrong answer.
-Whoa!

11:13.300 --> 11:14.722
I swear i didn't
touch your truck.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.332
Jake: If i find out
you were lying,

11:16.340 --> 11:19.707
I swear to god
you are dead.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.564
I believe you.

11:25.580 --> 11:28.071
Misspelling douche
was an interesting choice.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.776
Yeah, well i should've
used the spray stuff.

11:30.790 --> 11:31.575
I got paint all over me.

11:31.590 --> 11:34.115
I looked like carrie at prom
by the time i got home.

11:34.120 --> 11:34.984
(both chuckle)

11:34.990 --> 11:36.252
I don't care
what the press says,

11:36.260 --> 11:38.114
Tyler's not some
closet slasher-psycho.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.155
I mean, i can't really
picture him doing it either,

11:40.160 --> 11:44.290
But if he's innocent,
why doesn't he come forward?

11:44.300 --> 11:45.597
I don't know.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.329
Maybe he's afraid.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.932
I just wish
he'd call me back.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.829
Hey, em,
did you get my texts?

11:51.840 --> 11:53.660
Good luck.
(chuckles)

11:53.680 --> 11:54.760
Yeah, i got your texts.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.032
Okay, well, i just want
a chance to explain, okay?

11:57.050 --> 12:01.498
This is gonna sound
like an excuse,
but, the thing with nina?

12:01.520 --> 12:05.342
I think she came onto me
because she felt threatened
by you.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.840
Like she wanted
some leverage.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.317
It's my fault
that you slept with nina?

12:09.320 --> 12:11.959
No, you know
how she played people.

12:11.960 --> 12:12.984
Yeah. We both knew.

12:12.990 --> 12:16.050
And i thought we had
something better than that.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.596
Em.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.361
This doesn't have to be over.

12:20.370 --> 12:21.792
Hey.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.691
Do you have a problem?

12:24.710 --> 12:26.837
Well, that's my locker.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.838
And i'm pretty sure
emma's done talking to you.

12:32.110 --> 12:34.749
Just stay out of this,
abercrombie.

12:37.650 --> 12:41.381
Do you want some
dueling pistols or something?

12:43.690 --> 12:45.226
(scoffs)

12:47.930 --> 12:48.919
Is that really your locker?

12:48.930 --> 12:50.989
Is that guy really
your boyfriend?

12:54.440 --> 12:55.566
And, um, fyi,

12:55.570 --> 12:59.358
I don't usually kiss
guys in greenhouses.

13:00.310 --> 13:02.301
I was upset.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.705
I'll see you around.

13:19.030 --> 13:21.021
Audrey, can we please talk?

13:21.030 --> 13:25.091
(sighs)
what's there to say?

13:25.900 --> 13:27.720
You and nina filmed
me and rachel.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.367
She posted it
all over the web.

13:29.370 --> 13:32.203
You lied about it
and now you feel guilty.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.132
There, we talked.

13:34.140 --> 13:34.834
You're right.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.775
I didn't stop nina
from filming you
and i should have.

13:37.780 --> 13:38.644
But...

13:38.650 --> 13:41.346
Hey, can we please
find a way to move on
from this?

13:41.350 --> 13:45.013
I mean, pretty soon,
there's gonna be
a new headline.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.317
Oh, so i should be
comforted by the fact

13:46.320 --> 13:49.312
That someone else
is bound to be
humiliated today?

13:49.320 --> 13:52.255
Those comments
aren't gorng away

13:52.260 --> 13:54.319
And rachel...

13:54.330 --> 13:56.719
Rachel can't ignore them
like i can.

13:56.730 --> 13:58.869
She won't even
text me back.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.269
(cell phone chimes)

14:00.270 --> 14:02.397
(cell phone chimes)

14:07.780 --> 14:09.839
(cell phones chiming)

14:11.080 --> 14:13.799
(all talking indistinctly)

14:14.850 --> 14:17.068
That's the brandon james mask.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.188
Guess you got
your new headline.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.179
Sheriff hudson:
Okay, mr. Mayor.

14:25.190 --> 14:28.728
The last thing we need
is the public seeing
that damn mask.

14:28.730 --> 14:29.992
Who leaked
the security footage?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.024
Nobody leaked anything,
all right?

14:31.030 --> 14:33.498
Someone filmed the murder
and posted it online.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.367
I got my tech guy
trying to trace it right now.

14:36.370 --> 14:37.029
Nina's autopsy.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.132
Have you seen the gif,
maggie?

14:38.140 --> 14:39.539
I mean, do you know
anything about this?

14:39.540 --> 14:41.428
I know i never needed
to see that mask again.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.432
(scoffs) well,
the press is in heaven.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.405
When o'neill put on that mask,

14:45.410 --> 14:47.947
He connected nina
to our Infamous past.

14:47.950 --> 14:49.838
You weren't there _
back when we were scraping

14:49.850 --> 14:52.148
"murderville"
off our town Sign.

14:52.150 --> 14:53.947
We now have real
economic development.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.885
People are moving here.
We have a bike path,
for crying out loud.

14:58.090 --> 15:01.526
Yes, tyler o'neill
is my main person
of interest, okay,

15:01.530 --> 15:04.749
But we don't know
for sure that that's him
behind that mask.

15:04.770 --> 15:06.920
Look, i talked
to his foster parents.

15:06.940 --> 15:07.599
They're worried.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.067
They don't think
he could have killed anyone.

15:09.070 --> 15:11.095
O'neill is hunkered
down somewhere

15:11.110 --> 15:13.237
And he is going to
make a mistake.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.437
You better be there
to catch him when he does.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.472
You okay?

15:23.850 --> 15:25.442
After that gif went viral,

15:25.450 --> 15:29.750
Our hotlines lit up
with brandon james
wannabes.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.681
Any of them
seem dangerous?

15:30.690 --> 15:32.487
No, we'll question
each and every one of them.

15:32.490 --> 15:35.493
Plus i'm pulling
the brandon james case files.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.695
I'm looking into
possible suspects.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.918
I'm gonna
keep you safe, okay?

15:39.940 --> 15:43.637
-(cell phone chimes)
-woman: Sheriff,
this just came in.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.130
Thanks.

15:45.340 --> 15:47.308
I got a call on kiley street.

15:47.310 --> 15:48.607
Me too.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.009
Oh, no!

15:51.750 --> 15:53.274
(sighs)

15:58.750 --> 16:01.287
Uh, hey,
riley, wait up.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.109
Hey.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.519
Uh, i saw that gif.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.679
Just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

16:04.690 --> 16:07.386
Yeah, i'm just a little
freaked out by it all.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.960
Kind of hard to concentrate
on computer saence

16:09.970 --> 16:11.153
With a deranged killer
on the loose.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.489
(chuckles)
tell me about it.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.899
Mid-term projects
are coming up,

16:13.900 --> 16:16.232
And i haven't decided
on my concept.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.969
You know, i'm actually
done with mine,

16:17.970 --> 16:19.107
If you need a hand.

16:19.110 --> 16:19.929
Oh, what're you doing?

16:19.940 --> 16:22.773
Uh, it's this app
that links into any
available downtime

16:22.780 --> 16:24.270
At the canberra dss
satellite array.

16:24.280 --> 16:28.842
Basically, lets you
tool around the universe
from any mobile deVIce,

16:28.850 --> 16:30.340
See the stars.

16:30.750 --> 16:31.318
Cool!

16:31.320 --> 16:33.948
But if you wanna stargaze,
maybe you should go outside.

16:33.960 --> 16:39.182
(chuckles) lie down
on the grass, look up.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.623
That's another way to go.

16:41.860 --> 16:43.623
If you wanna
try it sometime.

16:44.230 --> 16:46.960
Oh, so like
a you and me thing?

16:47.170 --> 16:50.059
Uh... (chuckles)
that sounds...

16:50.670 --> 16:52.399
Hmm. (chuckles)

16:52.410 --> 16:53.638
(chuckles)

16:53.640 --> 16:54.629
I'll see you in class.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.700
Okay, i'll see you in class.

16:59.550 --> 17:01.006
I have zero game.

17:01.020 --> 17:01.702
(bell ringing)

17:01.720 --> 17:02.948
All right, guys,
you know, phones down.

17:02.950 --> 17:06.010
But, the brandon james gif
put us on the map, mr. B.

17:06.020 --> 17:08.113
I mean, we've got like
seven of the top ten

17:08.120 --> 17:09.451
Trending hashtags
right now.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.212
You know,
maybe you should focus
more on your studies

17:11.230 --> 17:13.084
And less on
lakewood's web-buzz.

17:13.090 --> 17:14.489
Who can resist
a murder selfie?

17:14.500 --> 17:18.220
Which is what
the killer is counting on.

17:20.100 --> 17:25.333
All right, will graham,
what is this killer's design?

17:25.340 --> 17:29.174
Well, murder's a lonely game,
you know.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.831
I mean,
say you're the killer, okay.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.374
You sneak into
nina's house,

17:33.380 --> 17:35.268
You skulk around
and scare her

17:35.280 --> 17:37.145
And then you kill her.
Boom!

17:37.150 --> 17:37.844
But then what?

17:37.850 --> 17:39.078
You take a victory lap
around the pool?

17:39.090 --> 17:43.015
You just stand there,
watching the blood
spread out in the water,

17:43.020 --> 17:45.250
Thinking your
crazy guy thoughts.

17:45.260 --> 17:46.784
Creepy monolog alert.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.928
So maybe it's no good
if he's the only one
who's watching.

17:49.930 --> 17:50.692
Exactly, yeah!

17:50.700 --> 17:52.895
Uh, it's the age of instagram
and youtube and tumblr.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.438
-I mean, we need to share
the things we do...
-(cell phone chimes)

17:56.440 --> 17:58.567
...Or it's like
it never happened.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.128
Riley, phones off.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.129
Sorry, mr. B.

18:01.140 --> 18:04.007
My friend from
saint mary's texted.

18:04.210 --> 18:06.508
A girl that goes there died.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.401
Brooke: No way.
Who was it?

18:08.420 --> 18:10.047
Jake: How'd it happen?

18:10.250 --> 18:11.444
It doesn't say.

18:11.450 --> 18:14.214
Branson: I'm sorry
to hear that, riley.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.448
Uh, why don't we
get back to...

18:15.460 --> 18:18.918
I have, uh,
to go to the bathroom.

18:19.130 --> 18:20.028
(door slams shut)

18:20.030 --> 18:23.022
Branson: Actually, let's...
Let's all take a minute.

18:27.170 --> 18:28.319
(sobbing)

18:28.340 --> 18:30.433
Audrey, is everything okay?

18:32.170 --> 18:33.569
I called rachel
to check on her.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.879
(sniffles) her mom
answered her phone.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.179
They found her hanging
from her ceiling fan.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.444
She's dead.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.989
(noah sighs)

19:04.010 --> 19:07.161
Hey, you,
you going home?

19:07.180 --> 19:09.705
Uh, my dad's
coming to pick me up.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.928
I am officially distraught.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.508
Right.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.270
Um...

19:17.850 --> 19:20.580
I'm sorry about rachel.

19:21.590 --> 19:22.488
Yeah, well,

19:22.490 --> 19:24.185
Our relationship
wasn't even legal

19:24.190 --> 19:28.752
Under the bylaws of
lakewood municipal code, so...

19:29.100 --> 19:30.158
Gay rights joke.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.922
(chuckles)

19:38.440 --> 19:40.237
My friend, caden,
goes to saint mary's.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.438
Apparently, rachel
was just a train wreck
looking for a station.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.702
Brooke, she just
killed herself.
And it's because of me.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.268
You can't blame yourself
for that video.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.611
We were all there
that day.

19:49.620 --> 19:52.248
But, i was the one
in the parking lot
with nina.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.740
I let it happen.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.651
I'm sorry,
ijust need a minute.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.654
(sighs)

20:03.900 --> 20:05.925
(sniffling)

20:06.630 --> 20:08.427
Girl: So tragic.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.464
Whoever posted that video

20:09.470 --> 20:11.768
Has even more blood
on their hands now.

20:11.770 --> 20:14.864
Sounds like_
we got a new nina.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.018
Can i take that for you?

20:33.700 --> 20:36.328
I guess, i kind of
set up shop here.

20:36.330 --> 20:37.422
If your boss is
a squatter nazi,

20:37.430 --> 20:39.569
I can totally buy
a breakfast b_urrito
or something.

20:39.570 --> 20:43.495
I know your voice.
You do that
autopsy of a cr/me
podcast.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.298
Good ear.
I'm piper shaw.

20:47.410 --> 20:49.628
You're emma duval, right?

20:49.640 --> 20:52.177
Um, yeah,
how did you know that?

20:52.180 --> 20:54.546
Research.
I'm doing a profile...

20:54.550 --> 20:55.949
About the murder,
yeah, i heard.

20:55.950 --> 20:59.386
Um, well,
i'll let you get back to it.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.786
Your dad's kevin duval,

21:01.790 --> 21:04.884
The sole survivor of
the brandon james attacks?

21:04.890 --> 21:06.050
I actually don't talk
about that.

21:06.060 --> 21:09.393
Uh, sorry, i'm just
trying to see if
there's any connection

21:09.400 --> 21:12.221
Between what happened then
and what's happening now.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.767
No agenda,
just the truth.

21:15.270 --> 21:17.534
I also have a very serious
caffeine addiction,

21:17.540 --> 21:20.202
So you'll be seeing
a lot of me.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.603
Okay, well, you respect
my privacy

21:22.610 --> 21:26.046
And i will keep you
caffeinated.

21:26.050 --> 21:27.608
Fair enough.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.139
Good night.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.398
-(bottle rolling)
-hello?

21:56.140 --> 21:57.676
(coughs)

22:04.920 --> 22:06.319
(gasps)

22:11.690 --> 22:13.851
(rattling)

22:14.430 --> 22:16.318
(breathing heavily)

22:37.520 --> 22:39.112
Em! (grunts)

22:39.420 --> 22:40.614
VVhoa!

22:40.620 --> 22:41.712
Will!

22:41.720 --> 22:42.812
What are you doing here?

22:42.820 --> 22:44.583
Uh, i got your text.

22:44.590 --> 22:47.127
(heavy breathing)

22:52.200 --> 22:53.792
Em, are you sure
you're okay?

22:53.800 --> 22:56.064
I didn't send you
this text.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.628
Will: What?

22:58.540 --> 23:00.701
Someone is pretending
to be me.

23:00.710 --> 23:01.699
Hey, it's okay.

23:01.710 --> 23:03.371
Maybe it's just brooke
trying to play matchmaker.

23:03.380 --> 23:07.908
No. Brooke thinks
you need a little more
time on the bench.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.272
Great.

23:10.280 --> 23:11.816
Thanks, brooke.

23:11.820 --> 23:12.980
Em, (sighs) listen,

23:12.990 --> 23:18.110
I've been so busy explaining,
that i never apologized.

23:18.930 --> 23:19.988
I'm really,
really sorry.

23:19.990 --> 23:25.622
And there's no excuse,
it was stupid,
and thoughtless and crazy.

23:25.630 --> 23:29.259
The thing with nina,
it was just once.

23:30.470 --> 23:32.438
Okay. I mean,
i guess that's fair.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.338
The... (breaths deeply)

23:33.340 --> 23:36.878
The thing with
me and kieran
was just once, too.

23:36.880 --> 23:37.801
(scoffs)

23:37.810 --> 23:38.879
What thing with kieran?

23:38.880 --> 23:41.041
I kissed him at the party

23:41.050 --> 23:45.373
In the greenhouse
and it felt great.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.787
(scoffs)

23:51.760 --> 23:54.228
I guess, i deserve that.
(sighs)

23:54.600 --> 23:56.750
If i can't trust you,
i can't be with you.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.867
I know and...
I know i have to
earn that back.

24:02.300 --> 24:05.804
It would mean a lot
if you came
to the game tomorrow.

24:07.740 --> 24:10.675
My dad is out of control.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.878
I'm under a lot of pressure.

24:16.650 --> 24:18.242
I'll try.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.354
This is odd.

24:28.730 --> 24:32.689
Hey, i figured
you could use some caffeine.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.262
Look, honey,
i don't usually mind you
visiting me at work,

24:36.270 --> 24:38.864
But this one's
a little disturbing.

24:38.870 --> 24:40.735
Is that rachel murray?

24:42.140 --> 24:43.334
She was a cutter?

24:43.340 --> 24:46.707
Yeah, she had some
issues with depression.

24:46.710 --> 24:49.611
Yeah, yeah,
audrey knew her.

24:49.620 --> 24:50.279
They were close.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.784
Rachel's mom mentioned
something about
a cyber-bullying video.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.850
Was audrey the one
rachel was kissing?

24:56.860 --> 24:58.350
Yeah.

24:59.690 --> 25:02.989
(sobbing) nina was the
one who filmed them.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.761
I was there.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.188
I let it happen.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.734
What?

25:15.040 --> 25:16.769
Emma!

25:17.310 --> 25:19.005
I'm sorry.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.449
(laughing)

26:08.430 --> 26:11.593
Maggie: The injuries
don't make sense with
where we found her.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.022
You mean hanging from
a ceiling fan?

26:13.030 --> 26:15.066
Exactly.
Her neck snapped.

26:15.070 --> 26:16.662
She would have to
fall from much higher up
for that to happen.

26:16.670 --> 26:19.867
Which means
it's possible that rachel
didn't commit suicide.

26:19.870 --> 26:25.536
Well, i'd have to
finish the autopsy
to be sure, but yes.

26:26.910 --> 26:28.275
Hey...

26:29.720 --> 26:30.948
What?

26:30.950 --> 26:32.645
What is it?

26:33.920 --> 26:38.653
Emma confessed that
she could've stopped
that video that went viral.

26:38.660 --> 26:40.150
She blames herself
for this.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.151
But now, if rachel
didn't commit suicide...

26:42.160 --> 26:44.390
I mean, not that
that excuses
what she did...

26:44.400 --> 26:46.220
I get it. I get it.

26:46.470 --> 26:47.789
Take the time you need.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.860
_ If this death
is SUSplCIOUS, it's...

26:52.010 --> 26:53.500
It's your call.

26:53.510 --> 26:56.968
What if that call is
rachel murray was murdered?

26:57.180 --> 27:00.274
Then things just got
a lot more complicated.

27:04.050 --> 27:05.449
Announcer:
Welcome everyone,

27:05.450 --> 27:06.781
To george washington
high school.

27:06.790 --> 27:09.953
And welcome,

stanton bulldogs,

27:09.960 --> 27:15.751

lakewood lancers/

27:15.760 --> 27:17.899
Sportsball! Yay!

27:22.870 --> 27:23.859
You see the scout from duke?

27:23.870 --> 27:26.430
(sighs) maybe it's better
if i don't know
which one is him.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.136
How'd it go with emma?
Did it work?

27:30.240 --> 27:31.798
She's here.

27:33.410 --> 27:35.105
That's all that matters.

27:42.660 --> 27:46.528
Um, i'm gonna go get
some licorice whips.

27:46.730 --> 27:48.425
Be right back.

27:49.560 --> 27:50.094
Really?

27:50.100 --> 27:51.988
Who the hell do you kids think
you are? Give me that.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.558
Give it to me!

27:55.170 --> 27:58.230
Hey, you sure
you're up for filming
game highlights?

27:58.240 --> 28:00.128
'cause i'm happy
to do it.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.199
I need the distraction.

28:02.410 --> 28:03.809
So, riley still hasn't
texted me back.

28:03.810 --> 28:07.200
(sighs) i went full geek,
with the stargazing app,
right?

28:07.210 --> 28:10.543
Gosh, i wish there was,
like, a line on a gauge
somewhere.

28:11.220 --> 28:13.108
(cell phone beeping)

28:14.690 --> 28:15.213
Game on!

28:15.220 --> 28:19.213
Or, you know, i mean,
i can totally stay and keep
your batteries charged.

28:19.230 --> 28:21.255
Go. I can do this.

28:21.260 --> 28:22.420
You have other batteries
to charge.

28:22.430 --> 28:23.852
You are the definition
of da bomb.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.920
Hmm.
Make good choices.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.092
Have fun.

28:29.370 --> 28:31.634
Good evening,
lancer fans.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.465
Welcome.

28:32.470 --> 28:33.459
It has been
(sighs)

28:33.470 --> 28:35.438
An emotional week
for lakewood

28:35.440 --> 28:39.649
With the loss of
two lo ve/y young souls
in our community,

28:39.650 --> 28:42.676
Nina patterson
and rachel murray.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.309
-(camera beeps)
-lets have
a moment of s/lence.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.192
Riley!

29:09.240 --> 29:12.277
Uh, i'm here.
(chuckles nervously)

29:17.220 --> 29:18.915
Riley!

29:29.260 --> 29:31.558
(shouting)
riley!

29:37.970 --> 29:39.437
(sighs)

29:47.450 --> 29:51.011
-Just let
your eyes adjust.
-Oh, jeez!

29:51.020 --> 29:52.078
(stuttering)

29:52.090 --> 29:53.842
You're like a ninja!

29:53.850 --> 29:54.942
-That's racist.
-What?

29:54.960 --> 29:55.847
Oh, no. (stutters)

29:55.860 --> 29:58.283
-I didn't mean like...
-(laughs) come on!

29:58.960 --> 30:00.188
-Come on!
-(|aughing)

30:00.190 --> 30:02.624
-(whistle blowing)
-(cheering)

30:12.470 --> 30:14.062
(clears throat)

30:19.110 --> 30:21.977
How's it shaking,
mr. B?

30:22.750 --> 30:24.069
Good, thanks, brooke.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.548
Can i get a small popcorn?

30:28.320 --> 30:31.187
You know, you're not
making this any easier.

30:31.530 --> 30:35.921
I'm not the one
who discontinued
our study sessmns.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.795
When can we talk?

30:40.300 --> 30:41.790
Language arts.

30:41.800 --> 30:42.789
Third period.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.789
You know what i mean.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.098
(softly)
i miss you.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.900
Then grow a pair
and come get me.

30:51.910 --> 30:54.105
(cheering continues)

30:58.450 --> 30:59.678
Hey!

30:59.690 --> 31:01.317
Hi.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.380
Your boy's pretty good.

31:04.760 --> 31:05.749
You ever let him
plead his case?

31:05.760 --> 31:09.526
Yeah. Right after
i almost took his head off
with a two-by-four.

31:10.870 --> 31:11.620
I was, uh.

31:11.630 --> 31:13.495
I was closing up at work
and i'm pretty sure
someone was...

31:13.500 --> 31:17.891
I don't know,
trying to scare me
or something.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.229
And then he showed up?

31:19.240 --> 31:22.459
-(whistle blows)
-announcer:
Turnover
by the bulldogs.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.778
-Possession lancers.
-What?

31:24.780 --> 31:25.701
It's classic.

31:25.710 --> 31:30.113
Messes with your head
and then rescues you.

31:31.550 --> 31:32.881
No way.

31:34.760 --> 31:38.582
Did he ask you
for one little favor?

31:38.590 --> 31:42.082
Something that
tugged at your heartstrings?

31:45.770 --> 31:47.522
I thought so.

31:49.770 --> 31:54.639
Noah: Romance is always
shoe-horned into genre fare.

31:54.640 --> 31:55.834
I mean, seriously,

31:55.840 --> 31:58.331
Why would sarah connor
and kyle reese
sleep together

31:58.350 --> 32:02.207
If they have the terminator
chasing after them?

32:02.220 --> 32:03.573
Is that the new
terminator
mOVIe

32:03.580 --> 32:05.673
With the dragon chick
from
game of thrones?

32:05.690 --> 32:08.341
No, no,
it's the original!

32:08.360 --> 32:09.384
Ah! (chuckles)

32:09.390 --> 32:12.712
It's only, like,
my favorite movie.

32:12.730 --> 32:14.686
Maybe we can
watch it sometime.

32:14.700 --> 32:18.727
Sure or, you know,
i can loan you my blu-ray.

32:21.570 --> 32:22.320
(chuckles)

32:22.340 --> 32:23.864
Oh, what about
the walking dead?

32:23.870 --> 32:25.565
They're not rushing
the romance.

32:25.570 --> 32:27.162
They've spent
five seasons

32:27.170 --> 32:28.706
Letting claryl and carol
fall in love.

32:28.710 --> 32:30.735
Right. Because we're all
watching the zombie show

32:30.740 --> 32:34.403
To see if the hick
and the housewife
will sleep together.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.307
(scoffs)

32:35.320 --> 32:36.673
That's why i watch it.

32:36.680 --> 32:40.719
A girl loves
a little romance
With her gore.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.888
Um, these are really good.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.286
It's kind of herby.

32:47.290 --> 32:50.350
It's a basil cucumber martini.

32:51.530 --> 32:53.191
Always shaken.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.992
Never stirred.

33:01.510 --> 33:03.205
(chuckles)

33:04.410 --> 33:06.071
Noah,

33:06.280 --> 33:08.009
Are you a virgin?

33:08.020 --> 33:08.577
What?

33:08.580 --> 33:09.979
Uh.
(nervous chuckle)

33:09.980 --> 33:13.438
No, no,
i'm like a regular man-slut.

33:13.450 --> 33:16.817
Just like so many girl...

33:22.960 --> 33:26.623
-(cheering)
-announcer:
Ten seconds

33:30.340 --> 33:33.434
W/l/ be/mont for three!

33:34.840 --> 33:37.900
Final score, 47-46.

33:37.910 --> 33:43.177
Its your lakewood lancers
with the victory!

33:48.520 --> 33:50.056
Hey, thanks for being here.

33:50.060 --> 33:52.016
Yeah, everyone's here.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.180
You played a good game.

33:55.630 --> 33:56.949
Thanks.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.690
So what's up
with that guy, huh?

34:01.300 --> 34:02.119
Do you like him?

34:02.140 --> 34:04.938
Will, i don't wanna
have a fight.

34:06.710 --> 34:08.166
Good.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.068
'cause me neither.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.818
I miss that.

34:22.390 --> 34:24.278
Good night, will.

34:25.790 --> 34:28.281
Brooke, come on, let's go.

34:39.540 --> 34:41.098
Hi.

34:43.410 --> 34:49.246
I, uh, i liked the film
you made for rachel.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.713
Thanks.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.615
It was just some clips.

34:53.620 --> 34:55.611
It was really beautiful.

34:57.830 --> 34:58.580
Look, i...

34:58.590 --> 35:00.455
I know that_ rachel
had some issues.

35:00.460 --> 35:01.358
What, the cutting?

35:01.360 --> 35:03.521
Let me guess,
you're gonna tell me
that she killed herself

35:03.530 --> 35:06.419
-Because she was
depressed.
-No, no!

35:06.630 --> 35:08.393
I did this, okay?

35:08.400 --> 35:09.662
Whether the video
was a tiny part of it

35:09.670 --> 35:11.592
Or the thing that pushed her
over the edge,

35:11.610 --> 35:14.761
I am taking
full responsibility.

35:17.340 --> 35:19.945
You have every reason
to hate me.

35:47.470 --> 35:49.461
(alarm blaring)

35:49.480 --> 35:51.607
Automated voice:
Kitchen door.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.845
Kitchen door.

35:53.850 --> 35:56.569
-/(itchen door.
-(alarm stops)

36:09.430 --> 36:11.557
(telephone ringing)

36:14.400 --> 36:17.699
-Hello?
7Man: .
/-//, th/s /s
gpp security.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.190
We got an alarm notice
at your house.

36:19.210 --> 36:21.531
Can you give me your name
and code word?

36:21.540 --> 36:23.701
Um, my name is
emma duval,

36:23.710 --> 36:26.838
And the code word is,
uh, "amethyst."

36:26.850 --> 36:29.648
Um, i, ijust found
my kitchen door open.

36:29.650 --> 36:31.914
Just take
a deep breath, emma.

36:31.920 --> 36:32.739
We got a patrol nearby.

36:32.750 --> 36:34.945
l-le can be _there
In a few m/nutes.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.349
Should, i,
maybe go wait outside?

36:37.360 --> 36:38.258
You ’re safer inside.

36:38.260 --> 36:43.050
If someone tried to break in,
he probably took off
when the alarm sounded.

36:43.830 --> 36:47.266
Would you...
Would you stay
on the line with me

36:47.270 --> 36:48.862
Until somebody
gets here?

36:48.870 --> 36:50.565
Sure, i can do that.

36:50.570 --> 36:51.594
Sorry ifi sound paranoid,

36:51.610 --> 36:54.807
It's just, my family
has been harassed before.

36:54.810 --> 36:55.560
No worries.

36:59.610 --> 37:02.078
Um, how far away is he?

37:02.080 --> 37:05.675
D/spatch says
three minutes, tops.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.749
So, what’re you
doing home tonight?

37:07.750 --> 37:09.479
Watching some tv?

37:09.490 --> 37:10.411
Anything good on?

37:10.420 --> 37:12.615
Is this your way
of trying to distract me?

37:12.630 --> 37:15.121
(chuck/es)

right through me.

37:15.130 --> 37:16.449
Sorry, but it's not working.

37:16.460 --> 37:18.428
Come on.
Humor me.

37:18.430 --> 37:20.660
-What do you l/ke to watch?
-I don't know.

37:20.670 --> 37:23.730
Uh,

37:23.740 --> 37:25.367
Man:
How to get away
with murder?

37:25.370 --> 37:27.429
Yeah. That one's
pretty good, i guess.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.328
I l/ke a strong female lead

37:29.340 --> 37:30.739
You sound
pretty tough yourself

37:30.740 --> 37:32.378
If that guys
st/l/ in your house,

37:32.380 --> 37:33.870
Maybe he should be afraid.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.507
Don't even joke about that.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.544

37:38.790 --> 37:40.712
Comedy? Horror?

37:40.720 --> 37:41.539
Definitely not horror.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.256
Real life is scary enough
these days.

37:44.260 --> 37:46.012
I barely sleep anymore.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.225

solong?

37:57.270 --> 37:59.192
He’s getting close.

38:02.610 --> 38:04.339
What you should
really be asking Is,

38:04.340 --> 38:08.276
Did you just
lock me in or out?

38:09.420 --> 38:11.149
If you're in this house,
i swear to god.

38:11.150 --> 38:15.041
What? You gonna try
a little batting practice
on me?

38:15.060 --> 38:17.153
Yeah, you're damn right
i will.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.980
Gotta find me ﬁrst.

38:18.990 --> 38:20.981
And i could be anywhere.

38:21.190 --> 38:23.988
I've got your number.
I'm calling the police.

38:24.000 --> 38:24.728
By all means.

38:24.730 --> 38:27.290
They’ll reach a nice
confused man named art

38:27.300 --> 38:29.268
Who works at gpp security.

38:29.270 --> 38:31.795
And the cops w/l/
never get here in t/me.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.598
So i suggest
you talk to me.

38:35.610 --> 38:37.032
What do you want from me?

38:37.040 --> 38:38.200
To show you
the truth, emma.

38:38.210 --> 38:40.747
-About what?
-Who you really are.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.968
And trust me,
its gonna hurt.

38:42.980 --> 38:44.379
You don't know me.

38:44.380 --> 38:45.176
But i do.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.511
And thats the real
horror show.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.784
I know that
everyone you trust

38:49.790 --> 38:52.714
Is lying to you,
playing you.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.382
What are you talking about?

38:54.390 --> 38:56.585
Your two-faced friends,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.457
Your fraud of a fam/ly,

38:59.930 --> 39:02.160
Your whore of a mother.

39:02.170 --> 39:04.297
It all started with her,
emma.

39:04.300 --> 39:07.167
But its gonna
end with you.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.702

39:08.710 --> 39:10.632
