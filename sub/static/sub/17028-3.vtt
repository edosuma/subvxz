WEBVTT

00:02.844 --> 00:05.240
What the hell are we doing
here on a Tuesday afternoon?

00:05.241 --> 00:08.837
The only customer we had was
Earl and he forgot he works here

00:08.838 --> 00:10.215
and ordered lunch.

00:10.353 --> 00:12.596
First of all, you are
forgetting the pack of dogs

00:12.597 --> 00:15.413
that wandered in, had an orgy, and left.

00:15.763 --> 00:17.431
Probably easy for me to forget 'cause

00:17.432 --> 00:20.200
I wasn't the one they
tried to have sex with.

00:20.201 --> 00:22.803
And we still have to work
here because our dessert bar's

00:22.804 --> 00:25.105
only been open a week; we need income.

00:25.106 --> 00:27.708
I don't like working in the daytime.

00:27.709 --> 00:31.211
You can see freaky things in this light.

00:31.212 --> 00:33.580
Look, there's an ant carrying a stool.

00:33.581 --> 00:37.150
Look, there's a waitress
carrying nothing.

00:37.151 --> 00:39.553
Wow, Han, you have new-stool money?

00:39.554 --> 00:43.724
Are you in Forbes' "40 Under 4 Feet?"

00:43.725 --> 00:46.994
I didn't buy this. Lady
Luck threw me a bone.

00:46.995 --> 00:50.130
I'm sure she hated
herself in the morning.

00:50.131 --> 00:52.833
A beloved old man in
my building passed away,

00:52.834 --> 00:55.202
and after the neighbors
paid our solemn respects,

00:55.203 --> 00:56.803
we cleaned the dump out.

00:56.804 --> 00:59.439
Han, that is so disrespectful.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.908
We didn't get a text?

01:01.909 --> 01:04.611
Ooh, I forgot my sweet
hemorrhoid doughnut I scored.

01:04.611 --> 01:07.881
You don't need hemorrhoids to enjoy it.

01:07.882 --> 01:09.483
Hemorrhoid doughnut.

01:09.484 --> 01:12.986
All of the comfort and
none of the calories.

01:12.987 --> 01:16.089
Ooh! A new stool.

01:16.090 --> 01:19.393
2005 is shaping up to be a great year.

01:19.394 --> 01:21.361
That's Han's stool.

01:21.362 --> 01:24.131
Well, Han's stool just
bought a one-way ticket

01:24.132 --> 01:26.833
to Earl's butt.

01:26.834 --> 01:29.069
This the saddest episode
of Game of Thrones

01:29.070 --> 01:30.837
I've ever seen.

01:30.838 --> 01:33.840
Still, I'm rooting for the dwarf.

01:37.578 --> 01:43.947
<font color="#33FF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

01:48.850 --> 01:52.729
Tonight, we are hitting the
chic-est spot in Williamsburg

01:52.730 --> 01:54.297
to poach their chic-est patrons.

01:54.298 --> 01:56.666
If we start out with a cool clientele,

01:56.667 --> 01:58.235
models, gays,

01:58.236 --> 02:01.738
rich guys that want to have
sex with models and gays,

02:01.739 --> 02:04.340
we'll be an in-spot
for at least five years.

02:05.909 --> 02:07.978
Were you talking to me that whole time?

02:07.979 --> 02:09.741
Who else would I be talking to?

02:09.741 --> 02:10.765
You're the only one here.

02:10.767 --> 02:12.115
Oh.

02:12.116 --> 02:13.216
That was a Randy giggle.

02:13.217 --> 02:15.819
And that's Randy's penis.

02:15.820 --> 02:19.089
Not all of it. It's
a pretty small screen.

02:19.090 --> 02:21.491
Yeah, we decided to
continue our nonexclusive,

02:21.492 --> 02:24.561
long-distance, sexting thing.

02:24.562 --> 02:27.130
Is that the Oxford English
Dictionary definition?

02:27.131 --> 02:31.067
If Oxford likes to get
naked and squat over a phone.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.470
But your girl's running
out of sexting ideas.

02:33.471 --> 02:35.839
There's only four emojis
that look like penises.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.174
Five if you count the corn on the cob.

02:38.175 --> 02:40.176
Don't ruin the corn on the cob for me.

02:40.177 --> 02:43.013
I use that for barbecues
and farmers markets.

02:43.014 --> 02:46.416
That's what you were talking about?

02:46.417 --> 02:49.452
I've just been adding "in
my pants" to everything.

02:51.122 --> 02:53.990
"What do you think about climate change

02:53.991 --> 02:55.592
in my pants?"

02:55.593 --> 02:58.328
Come on, I need you focused tonight.

02:58.329 --> 02:59.696
No more sexting.

02:59.697 --> 03:01.788
Just put it away and
tell him to do the same.

03:01.789 --> 03:04.167
All right, let me just
find the eggplant emoji

03:04.168 --> 03:05.969
and, of course, the pants.

03:11.641 --> 03:13.276
Hey, girls.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.283
Oh, do you need a hand there, Soph...

03:17.284 --> 03:18.784
I can do it!

03:20.550 --> 03:23.720
Sophie, why the enormous
old-timey stroller?

03:23.721 --> 03:25.055
There better be a cartoon baby

03:25.056 --> 03:27.090
dressed like Al Capone in that thing.

03:27.091 --> 03:28.725
Hey, girls,

03:28.726 --> 03:32.963
can Barbara and me
stay down here tonight?

03:32.964 --> 03:35.131
Oleg and I can't have
sex for two more weeks

03:35.132 --> 03:37.367
and it's just getting
too steamy up there.

03:37.368 --> 03:40.236
So, that explains the heavy panting

03:40.237 --> 03:43.039
we're hearing through our
ceiling, our walls, and

03:43.040 --> 03:45.375
most disturbing of all, our drain.

03:45.376 --> 03:47.609
I gotta pee.

03:48.878 --> 03:51.081
I gotta go all the time now.

03:51.082 --> 03:52.716
You know, that's
something that you girls

03:52.717 --> 03:54.718
need to know about me.

03:54.719 --> 03:56.853
Any time that we talk,

03:56.854 --> 03:58.821
I'm peeing a little bit.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.991
Uh... yeah.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.664
Oh.

04:07.665 --> 04:11.601
There's daddy's little jock block.

04:11.602 --> 04:15.005
I tried to release my sexual
frustration creatively,

04:15.006 --> 04:16.539
but my erotic poetry

04:16.540 --> 04:19.009
was rejected by National Pornographic

04:19.010 --> 04:22.645
for being, quote, "just disgusting."

04:22.646 --> 04:24.814
My sexts are so lame.

04:24.815 --> 04:26.616
Why can't I be disgusting?

04:26.617 --> 04:29.719
There's a burrito stuck to
the side of your dresser.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.652
You're there.

04:33.757 --> 04:35.825
"Can't wait for you to put your butt

04:35.826 --> 04:37.727
"on top of... my butt

04:37.728 --> 04:40.263
in my pants"?

04:40.264 --> 04:42.866
Jeez, thanks for the nice
break from being horny.

04:42.867 --> 04:46.036
I am not proud of how not slutty it is.

04:46.037 --> 04:48.571
Now, give me back my phone.
It hasn't had its shots.

04:48.572 --> 04:51.141
- Sent.
- What?

04:51.142 --> 04:54.577
"Your testicles are two
glistening Cadbury Eggs,

04:54.578 --> 04:57.579
and Mama's got a sweet tooth."

04:59.049 --> 05:00.717
This mama's got puke in her mouth.

05:00.718 --> 05:04.287
I cannot believe you'd send
something so disgusting.

05:04.288 --> 05:05.791
You are dead to m...

05:05.792 --> 05:07.190
He likes it!

05:07.191 --> 05:08.858
You want to turn a man on?

05:08.859 --> 05:10.359
Heh, you call Oleg.

05:21.771 --> 05:23.807
I hope it doesn't make
you too jealous, but

05:23.808 --> 05:27.811
I was just sexting with Randy.

05:27.812 --> 05:28.912
Yeah?

05:28.913 --> 05:32.315
- Yeah?
- Oh...

05:35.453 --> 05:37.353
Caroline, get the hose.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.960
Okay, now remember, we're
targeting models, gays,

05:43.961 --> 05:46.830
and upwardly mobile millennials
with discretionary income.

05:46.831 --> 05:49.099
Basically anyone better than us.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.700
Were you talking to me that whole time?

05:50.701 --> 05:52.524
And yes, I was talking
to you that whole time.

05:52.525 --> 05:53.638
IDs, please?

05:56.106 --> 05:57.607
You know they don't force you to use

05:57.608 --> 05:58.741
the first picture they take.

05:58.742 --> 06:01.176
I'm eating a pickle in mine.

06:02.512 --> 06:05.181
I think you look great.

06:05.182 --> 06:07.183
Hi, I'm Jake.

06:07.184 --> 06:08.618
Hi, Jake.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.953
ID, Jake?

06:09.954 --> 06:11.354
He's about 27,

06:11.355 --> 06:13.189
lots of discresh income?

06:13.190 --> 06:15.325
27 exactly.

06:15.326 --> 06:18.328
Guess my weight and
I'll buy you a drink.

06:18.329 --> 06:22.365
So, um, how do you maintain
such a dork-less clientele?

06:22.366 --> 06:24.534
I need to know 'cause I
have a roommate situation.

06:24.535 --> 06:26.435
Watch and learn, pickles.

06:27.837 --> 06:29.005
Oh, sweet,

06:29.006 --> 06:31.741
I found Carmen Sandiego.

06:31.742 --> 06:33.805
I don't know where in the
world you're going, buddy,

06:33.806 --> 06:36.012
but it ain't in here.

06:39.015 --> 06:40.650
Oh, you got this.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.485
But do not let the guy in the overalls

06:42.486 --> 06:46.156
get out of here without me
calling him "Farmer Yawn."

06:46.157 --> 06:48.124
Max, I am killing it.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.893
Jake, you've met.

06:49.894 --> 06:52.795
Nahani and Ariel are models.
They can eat whatever they want.

06:52.796 --> 06:54.164
♪ Hate them ♪

06:54.165 --> 06:55.565
And then, this is Tad

06:55.566 --> 06:56.699
and Jameson, they're gay.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.401
I perform reenactments

06:58.402 --> 07:02.238
of the life and tragic death
of Amy Winehouse with Barbies.

07:02.239 --> 07:04.574
I work at Staples.

07:04.575 --> 07:07.576
Oh, power couple.

07:14.872 --> 07:17.274
None of New York's elite
are here, besides me.

07:17.275 --> 07:20.978
I guess I'm not going
backstage at Barbie Winehouse.

07:20.979 --> 07:23.659
You tried to make them come to this bar

07:23.660 --> 07:25.344
and they said, "No, no, no."

07:26.117 --> 07:29.126
My gay guys at 12:00.

07:29.127 --> 07:30.661
I spoke too soon.

07:30.662 --> 07:32.162
And you spat a little.

07:32.163 --> 07:33.931
Tad! Jameson!

07:33.932 --> 07:35.966
Welcome to the M and C Dessert Bar.

07:35.967 --> 07:38.269
No, you're not dreaming!

07:38.270 --> 07:41.005
If they were, we'd be shirtless dudes.

07:41.006 --> 07:42.673
This place is fabulous.

07:42.674 --> 07:44.975
Can I have one of these
cookie dough-tinis?

07:44.976 --> 07:46.243
It's my cheat night,

07:46.244 --> 07:48.244
that's why I'm with him.

07:54.118 --> 07:56.086
Hmm, not sure who these gals are.

07:56.087 --> 07:59.890
Max, did you talk about
this place at Pep Boys?

07:59.891 --> 08:02.859
I told Manny and Moe, but
I didn't say a word to Jack.

08:04.728 --> 08:06.730
Oh, Tad. Let me get you another one.

08:06.731 --> 08:07.731
It's fine, it's fine.

08:07.732 --> 08:08.999
- It is?
- No.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.833
That's gay for "we're leaving."

08:14.405 --> 08:16.707
They chased off my hot gay guys.

08:16.708 --> 08:18.042
I don't want to be rude here,

08:18.043 --> 08:20.911
but who invited these horrible women?

08:20.912 --> 08:23.280
Charlene's in the house!

08:24.783 --> 08:26.984
And there it is. Damn it, Max.

08:26.985 --> 08:28.466
Why did you invite your bouncer buddy

08:28.467 --> 08:30.250
when you know I'm trying
to cultivate a vibe?

08:30.251 --> 08:31.889
I didn't invite her.

08:31.890 --> 08:33.957
And I did not think she'd
be wearing gym shorts

08:33.958 --> 08:35.458
and a SUNY Albany sweatshirt.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.294
Hey, I know you guys were trying

08:37.294 --> 08:38.529
to get the cool crowd in here,

08:38.530 --> 08:39.863
so, you know,

08:39.864 --> 08:41.664
boom!

08:41.666 --> 08:43.767
And where are they? The cool people?

08:43.768 --> 08:44.802
All right. Take it easy.

08:44.803 --> 08:46.203
Maybe they are cool.

08:46.204 --> 08:48.204
Is that one eating a PB and J?

08:50.040 --> 08:51.442
All right!

08:51.443 --> 08:54.378
Who wants to take on Big Reba?

08:54.379 --> 08:55.813
Take on how?

08:55.814 --> 08:57.247
Max, you speak Goon.

08:57.248 --> 08:59.883
How? How... how?

08:59.884 --> 09:01.285
Not fluently.

09:01.286 --> 09:03.487
I only lived in Goon for a semester.

09:03.488 --> 09:04.888
You're on.

09:04.889 --> 09:06.156
On how?

09:06.157 --> 09:07.156
How... how?

09:09.660 --> 09:11.528
Oh good, they brought rope.

09:11.529 --> 09:14.765
I hope they brought some for me too.

09:14.766 --> 09:17.635
And they did not bring deodorant.

09:17.636 --> 09:19.103
Ladies, what is this

09:19.104 --> 09:21.505
and how can we make it stop?

09:21.506 --> 09:24.041
You got a front row seat
to New York City's elite

09:24.042 --> 09:25.809
underground ladies' arm wrestling.

09:25.810 --> 09:29.580
One, two, three,

09:29.581 --> 09:30.781
wrestle!

09:37.655 --> 09:38.789
Oh, my God.

09:38.790 --> 09:41.959
I own an arm wrestling bar.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.027
No, you don't.

09:43.028 --> 09:44.762
We own an arm wrestling bar!

09:49.701 --> 09:51.635
I hope you're texting
Charlene and the rest of

09:51.636 --> 09:56.473
her WWE Raw crowd to
never come back to our bar.

09:56.474 --> 09:58.776
Uh, you were sobbing
and begging them to stop.

09:58.777 --> 10:00.310
I think she got the message.

10:00.311 --> 10:02.413
I don't know if she was listening.

10:02.414 --> 10:05.616
She was carrying Big Reba
around on her shoulders.

10:05.617 --> 10:07.184
This is pitiful.

10:07.185 --> 10:09.653
I just sexted Randy a
picture of a penguin.

10:09.654 --> 10:12.823
I don't even think
penguins are that sexy!

10:12.824 --> 10:16.060
Oh, my God. Everything is turning me on.

10:16.061 --> 10:18.328
I just walked in on an
elderly lady in the bathroom

10:18.329 --> 10:20.931
and almost lost my mind.

10:20.932 --> 10:22.533
What were you doing in the ladies' room?

10:22.534 --> 10:24.634
All right, fine, it was a man.

10:26.070 --> 10:27.805
Yeah, we all have problems.

10:27.806 --> 10:29.540
I have sexter's block.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.909
Want me to take a stab at it?

10:31.910 --> 10:34.578
See, that's already better
than anything I have.

10:34.579 --> 10:35.882
Just write it down. I don't want

10:35.883 --> 10:37.681
your fingerprints on my phone.

10:37.682 --> 10:39.749
You think I still have fingerprints?

10:41.251 --> 10:42.586
Oh, my God.

10:42.587 --> 10:44.788
Are you really gonna
have sext with Oleg?

10:44.789 --> 10:46.757
I don't know why you
think I'm above this.

10:46.758 --> 10:49.460
Out of the way. Earl's looking for me.

10:49.461 --> 10:51.495
And as soon as he realizes he's outside,

10:51.496 --> 10:53.130
I'm in big trouble.

10:53.131 --> 10:55.699
Can you unfollow a person in real life?

10:55.700 --> 10:58.836
Where would he least
expect me to hide this?

10:58.837 --> 11:00.704
Up high?

11:00.705 --> 11:03.574
"Shorty wouldn't go
high," Earl would say.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.976
Oh, won't I, Earl?

11:05.977 --> 11:08.212
Han, you're talking to yourself.

11:08.213 --> 11:11.014
And why don't you
just buy another stool?

11:11.015 --> 11:12.950
Earl wants this one.

11:12.951 --> 11:15.552
And for once in his life, he's
not gonna get what he wants!

11:15.553 --> 11:19.089
I'll just keep it under here
till he forgets about it.

11:19.090 --> 11:20.791
Which should be in about an hour.

11:20.792 --> 11:24.194
Yesterday I caught him putting
pennies on his sandwich.

11:24.195 --> 11:26.596
Hide and seek, old timer.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.800
I don't know how it's possible,

11:29.801 --> 11:31.969
but he's getting weirder.

11:31.970 --> 11:34.671
Those wrestlers won't be
back tonight, right, Max?

11:34.672 --> 11:37.107
Right, God? Are you there, God?

11:37.108 --> 11:41.078
It's me, Caroline, the
one you forgot about?

11:41.079 --> 11:43.579
Where'd that turd hide my stool?

11:48.285 --> 11:49.419
Thanks, y'all.

11:49.420 --> 11:51.787
I knew Shorty wouldn't go high.

11:54.424 --> 11:55.859
Oleg, how you doing over there?

11:55.860 --> 11:58.828
You're gonna need a bigger data plan.

12:03.835 --> 12:06.103
Max, it's been two nights in a row.

12:06.104 --> 12:07.938
If we don't nip this in the bud,

12:07.939 --> 12:10.674
we're both gonna be lady
arm wrestlers' girlfriends.

12:10.675 --> 12:12.543
You're not exactly thriving

12:12.544 --> 12:15.212
not being a lady arm
wrestler's girlfriend.

12:15.213 --> 12:16.814
And I don't see what the problem is.

12:16.815 --> 12:18.115
They're paying customers.

12:18.116 --> 12:19.916
They're drinking beer.

12:21.218 --> 12:25.255
From a helmet they brought with them.

12:25.256 --> 12:26.857
Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:26.858 --> 12:30.527
Don't go, don't go. Please, please, sir.

12:30.528 --> 12:32.963
Well, the last of our vibe is leaving.

12:32.964 --> 12:35.765
Pretty sure all these ladies have vibes.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.570
Guessing vintage plug-ins.

12:39.571 --> 12:41.705
That's it. Everybody!

12:41.706 --> 12:43.340
Everybody!

12:43.341 --> 12:46.443
You cannot have your arm
wrestling meetings here anymore.

12:46.444 --> 12:48.278
Find a dock or a junkyard

12:48.279 --> 12:51.582
or a Buffalo Wild Wings.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.317
Who wants to drink where they work?

12:53.318 --> 12:56.286
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:56.287 --> 12:58.088
This is discrimination.

12:58.089 --> 13:00.157
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

13:00.158 --> 13:03.560
Look, miss, I am extremely pro-lesbian.

13:04.562 --> 13:07.297
Please be lesbians.

13:07.298 --> 13:08.966
We're not lesbians.

13:08.967 --> 13:11.000
Ooh, swing and a miss.

13:12.502 --> 13:14.738
Actually, I am.

13:14.739 --> 13:17.074
That's the first time I've
said that out loud, isn't it?

13:17.075 --> 13:20.110
Wow, that's freeing.

13:20.111 --> 13:23.547
I am just anti-arm
wrestling in my dessert bar.

13:23.548 --> 13:25.048
Well, tough ta-tas.

13:25.049 --> 13:27.317
Which happens to be my other nickname.

13:27.318 --> 13:29.218
Go ahead, take a shot.

13:30.387 --> 13:32.155
I'll pass.

13:32.156 --> 13:33.624
Hold on, um,

13:33.625 --> 13:38.195
is that an open offer
on the, uh, ta-ta punch?

13:38.196 --> 13:40.430
Will you at least order some drinks?

13:40.431 --> 13:42.099
Okay, we'll order

13:42.100 --> 13:43.333
12 waters.

13:43.334 --> 13:44.501
Tap.

13:46.404 --> 13:48.538
You guys, please, this is my dream.

13:48.539 --> 13:51.675
And my dream doesn't have
soda-stained sweatpants in it.

13:51.676 --> 13:55.045
It's jelly, but whatever.

13:55.046 --> 13:56.613
I'm a reasonable woman.

13:56.614 --> 13:58.982
Yes, that is true.

13:58.983 --> 14:01.919
She's more reasonable than the
Big Reba at the train station.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.987
Fine, we'll leave.

14:03.988 --> 14:06.857
If one of you can beat me arm wrestling.

14:06.858 --> 14:09.126
But if neither of you can,

14:09.127 --> 14:10.928
my squad and I stay.

14:12.397 --> 14:15.132
Getting real '80s movie up in here.

14:15.133 --> 14:16.667
Huh? Who's it gonna be?

14:16.668 --> 14:18.635
It has to be you, Max. I'm weak,

14:18.636 --> 14:21.638
fragile, beautiful, but approachable.

14:21.639 --> 14:23.674
Ready to get taught
a lesson there, Jugsy?

14:23.675 --> 14:26.977
School's in session, Reebs.

14:26.978 --> 14:28.879
But call me Max.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.813
Jugsy is my mother's name.

14:32.215 --> 14:33.784
Do it, Max.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.953
She is gonna take you down

14:35.954 --> 14:37.321
to downtown...

14:37.322 --> 14:38.221
Mmm.

14:38.222 --> 14:39.489
In a car,

14:39.490 --> 14:40.557
made of...

14:40.558 --> 14:43.093
pain.

14:43.094 --> 14:45.128
Maybe just watch.

14:45.129 --> 14:49.599
On my count. One, two, three, wrestle!

14:57.475 --> 14:59.509
Oh... oh!

14:59.510 --> 15:03.280
Wrist can't hold! Nothing in the tank!

15:03.281 --> 15:05.849
All the sexting!

15:05.850 --> 15:08.318
Fight, Max! Put your back into it!

15:08.319 --> 15:10.020
My back's shot too.

15:10.021 --> 15:11.254
Haven't you seen my front?

15:18.329 --> 15:21.298
We're staying, girls!

15:21.299 --> 15:22.499
Max, what are we gonna do?

15:22.500 --> 15:24.134
I think it's pretty clear.

15:24.135 --> 15:26.003
You're gonna have to
arm wrestle Big Reba.

15:26.004 --> 15:28.437
Can't I just marry her?

15:35.579 --> 15:37.347
Come on now, Caroline, you got this.

15:37.348 --> 15:40.350
You've been wrestling with
disappointment for years.

15:40.351 --> 15:42.618
And I'm losing.

15:43.293 --> 15:44.493
On my count.

15:44.494 --> 15:47.364
One, two, three,

15:47.365 --> 15:48.198
wrestle!

15:51.369 --> 15:52.636
Ya'll seen the stool?

15:52.637 --> 15:54.304
Han hid it again.

15:54.305 --> 15:56.673
What in the sweet name of
Jesus is going on in here?

15:56.674 --> 15:58.942
Earl, I'm trying to motivate Caroline.

15:58.943 --> 16:00.686
Do you remember any of
the lines from Rocky?

16:00.687 --> 16:03.447
I'm gonna tell you what I
tell three tourists a day.

16:03.448 --> 16:06.216
I am not Carl Weathers.

16:06.217 --> 16:08.318
Max, I'm losing it!

16:08.319 --> 16:10.320
- Help that poor girl.
- Uh, Caroline,

16:10.321 --> 16:12.189
look at all these arm wrestling ladies

16:12.190 --> 16:13.657
in your dream dessert bar!

16:13.658 --> 16:15.993
You were aiming for five years of class,

16:15.994 --> 16:17.527
you didn't even get an hour!

16:20.898 --> 16:25.769
Hey, I can't get the
carriage in the dessert bar!

16:25.770 --> 16:29.873
The only place it would
fit was the car wash.

16:29.874 --> 16:31.675
Hey, what is all this?

16:31.676 --> 16:33.577
Caroline is trying win our bar back,

16:33.578 --> 16:34.945
and I'm trying to inspire her

16:34.946 --> 16:36.580
by pointing out how bad her life is.

16:36.581 --> 16:39.082
And I didn't get a text?

16:39.083 --> 16:40.784
Max, help!

16:40.785 --> 16:44.287
Uh... you haven't had sex in a year!

16:44.288 --> 16:47.324
And I think you know I'm
being quite generous there.

16:48.793 --> 16:51.962
It's working. She's lonely.

16:51.963 --> 16:55.165
You chased a dollar onto
the third rail of the subway,

16:55.166 --> 16:56.099
and you didn't get it!

16:59.470 --> 17:01.738
You work as a waitress in a diner!

17:04.642 --> 17:06.910
Did you mention the waitress thing?

17:06.911 --> 17:08.444
Yes, I just did, Earl.

17:08.445 --> 17:11.948
Sorry, things are getting
to me a little late.

17:11.949 --> 17:14.617
Wait, did... did you
tell her that baby Barbara

17:14.618 --> 17:16.252
is gonna get married before she is?

17:19.057 --> 17:20.257
Caroline,

17:20.258 --> 17:21.525
six years ago,

17:21.526 --> 17:23.260
you had a billion dollars,

17:23.261 --> 17:25.127
and now... I'm gonna say it...

17:25.128 --> 17:26.628
Say it!

17:28.397 --> 17:30.300
Old Navy is out of your price range!

17:40.311 --> 17:42.345
I haven't heard from Randy.

17:42.346 --> 17:45.916
Oleg's graphic sexts
must've freaked him out.

17:45.917 --> 17:49.285
Even Siri covered her eyes
after that last one I sent.

17:51.588 --> 17:53.523
You ask Michelangelo to paint,

17:53.524 --> 17:56.660
and then you criticize the painting.

17:56.661 --> 17:59.763
Why are you bringing the
Ninja Turtles into this?

17:59.764 --> 18:01.698
I just want to know what to do now.

18:01.699 --> 18:04.034
I completely understand if you don't

18:04.035 --> 18:07.671
want to take love advice from
an arm wrestling champion,

18:07.672 --> 18:11.108
but why don't you just
say "hi" or "I miss you"?

18:11.109 --> 18:14.478
"Hi, I miss you"?

18:14.479 --> 18:17.314
No "in my pants"?

18:17.315 --> 18:19.081
Okay, fine. I'll give it a shot.

18:20.684 --> 18:21.952
Hey everyb...

18:26.356 --> 18:27.724
Damn it.

18:27.725 --> 18:29.126
Do you need a hand there, Sophie?

18:29.127 --> 18:31.126
No, I got it!

18:35.031 --> 18:37.434
You really don't.

18:37.435 --> 18:40.470
Earl, you can have the stool.

18:40.471 --> 18:43.240
I've had a really hard year,

18:43.241 --> 18:45.108
and I allowed myself
this one indulgence.

18:45.109 --> 18:46.209
But, if it's important...

18:46.210 --> 18:48.812
Sweet, I'll take it.

18:48.813 --> 18:50.413
Oof! Cold as ice.

18:50.414 --> 18:52.983
I didn't come here to make friends.

18:52.984 --> 18:55.352
No stool for you.

18:55.353 --> 18:57.387
Hey... hey, why don't we settle this

18:57.388 --> 19:00.056
the 80s movie way and arm muscle for it?

19:00.057 --> 19:03.226
At my age, only thing I
can beat is a little girl.

19:03.227 --> 19:04.793
So, yeah.

19:06.897 --> 19:09.099
Bring it on.

19:09.100 --> 19:12.836
This little girl's
tougher than she looks.

19:12.837 --> 19:14.504
You won't be able

19:14.505 --> 19:16.773
to sit on that damn thing
after the ass whooping

19:16.774 --> 19:19.943
I'm about to lay on you, Shorty.

19:19.944 --> 19:23.280
Shorty's ass can take a lot, old man!

19:23.281 --> 19:25.882
We don't want to hear about
your personal life, Han.

19:25.883 --> 19:30.352
One, two, three, wrestle!

19:33.990 --> 19:36.660
Have they started yet?

19:36.661 --> 19:39.062
When this is over,

19:39.063 --> 19:41.598
I'm gonna be wiped out.

19:41.599 --> 19:44.734
You gonna help me carry
my stool back up there?

19:44.735 --> 19:46.670
Here's an idea.

19:46.671 --> 19:48.672
Yeah, you say it, Han!

19:48.673 --> 19:51.006
Burn in hell!

20:05.488 --> 20:09.024
Remember when I used to
make you moan like that?

20:16.366 --> 20:19.603
You really turn me on.

20:28.078 --> 20:31.214
Barbara, you stay with your daddy.

20:31.215 --> 20:34.049
He's a very sexy man.

20:36.253 --> 20:38.788
Randy texted me back "I miss you."

20:38.789 --> 20:40.657
Aw, that's so sweet.

20:40.658 --> 20:43.460
Oh! In his pants!

20:43.461 --> 20:45.996
Damn, Han,

20:45.997 --> 20:49.665
I didn't realize bad breath
was your secret weapon.

20:54.438 --> 20:57.674
Stool me, Shorty.

20:57.675 --> 20:59.909
Who am I wrestling for
the hemorrhoid doughnut?

21:03.758 --> 21:09.722
