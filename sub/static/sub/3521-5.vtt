01:53.246 --> 01:56.749
How'd it go?
They got a 48- to- 52
male- female ratio,

01:56.749 --> 01:58.751
which is great,

01:58.751 --> 02:01.754
strong liberal arts program
and this cool
olin arts center for music.

02:01.754 --> 02:04.257
Usual programs abroad
are china, india--

02:04.257 --> 02:06.759
you're just applyin' here.
Already you're leavin'?

02:06.759 --> 02:09.762
It's an option, dad.
Junior year.

02:09.762 --> 02:13.766
What do you study
in india? How not
to get diarrhea?

02:13.766 --> 02:17.270
They don't require sat scores,
but mine will help
'cause they're high.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.272
Socially, i don't know.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.274
This one girl told me
there's a saying:

02:21.274 --> 02:24.277
"Bates is the world's
most expensive form
of contraception."
Hey.

02:24.777 --> 02:28.781
What kind of talk is that?
The girls at the other colleges
we been to, they just put out?

02:28.781 --> 02:31.668
Oh, my god.

02:34.170 --> 02:36.172
It's pretty, huh?

02:36.673 --> 02:38.675
Yeah.

02:38.675 --> 02:41.044
Two to go.
Colby up.

02:43.046 --> 02:45.048
Dad, how come
you didn't finish college?

02:45.048 --> 02:48.551
Well, i had that
semester and a half
at seton hall.

02:48.551 --> 02:50.553
Yeah, and?

02:51.554 --> 02:54.057
Your grandma and grandpa
didn't stress college.

02:54.057 --> 02:56.192
They were
working- class people.

02:56.192 --> 02:58.695
How come your parents
were anti- education?

02:58.811 --> 03:02.815
They weren't anti.
You can't lay it
all off on them.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.819
I got into
a little trouble
when i was a kid.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.821
I heard.
Mm- hmm.
You did?

03:08.955 --> 03:11.457
While in waterville,
dine at the stone house,

03:11.457 --> 03:14.460
serving the freshest
maine lobster since 1840.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.963
Come see our new salad bar,
featuring a wonderful--

03:29.475 --> 03:32.979
are you
in the mafia?

03:32.979 --> 03:36.232
- Am i in the what?
- Whatever you wanna call it.
Organized crime.

03:38.601 --> 03:40.853
That's total crap.
Who told you that?

03:40.853 --> 03:42.855
Dad, i've lived in the house
all my life.

03:43.356 --> 03:46.359
I've seen police come with
warrants. I've seen you going
out at 3:00 in the morning.

03:46.859 --> 03:50.363
You never seen doc cusamano
go out at 3:00 in the morning
on a call?

03:50.613 --> 03:53.116
Did the cusamano kids ever find
$50, 000 in krugerrands...

03:53.116 --> 03:56.119
and a. 45 automatic while they
were hunting for easter eggs?

03:56.119 --> 04:00.123
I'm in the waste management
business. Everybody immediately
assumes you're mobbed- up.

04:00.123 --> 04:02.625
It's a stereotype,
and it's offensive.

04:02.625 --> 04:05.128
And you're the last person
i would want to perpetuate it.

04:05.128 --> 04:08.131
Fine.

04:09.632 --> 04:11.634
There is no mafia.

04:20.777 --> 04:23.279
All right, look.

04:23.279 --> 04:26.282
Med, you're a grown woman,
almost.

04:28.284 --> 04:31.287
Some of my money...

04:31.287 --> 04:34.290
comes from illegal gambling
and wha-- and whatnot.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.549
How does that make you feel?

04:43.549 --> 04:47.053
At least you don't keep
denying it, like mom.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.555
Kids in school think
it's actually kind of neat.

04:49.555 --> 04:52.175
- They seen
the godfather, right?
- Not really. Casinowe like.

04:52.175 --> 04:54.177
Sharon stone,
'70s clothes, pills.

04:54.677 --> 04:57.814
I'm not askin' about those bums.
I'm askin' about you.

04:58.064 --> 05:01.067
Sometimes i wish
you were like other dads.

05:01.067 --> 05:04.570
Then, like mr. Scangarelo,
for example.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.573
An advertising executive
for big tobacco.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.827
Or lawyers? Ugh.
So many dads are full of shit.

05:10.827 --> 05:13.830
- And i'm not?
- You finally told
the truth about this.

05:18.701 --> 05:24.590
Look, med,
part of my income comes
from legitimate businesses.

05:24.707 --> 05:26.959
- Stock market, i--
- look, dad, please. Okay?

05:27.460 --> 05:29.462
Don't start
mealy- mouthing.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.970
How's my sweetheart?

05:37.970 --> 05:40.973
I'm so pissed
i can hardly see.

05:41.474 --> 05:45.111
- Why? You gettin' the flu?
- No, it's my cousin, svetlana.

05:45.228 --> 05:48.231
- The amputee?
- Two months
she's only in america,

05:48.231 --> 05:50.233
and she's already
getting married.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.986
You knew the deal. I got
two kids high school age.
We talked about this.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.622
Yes, and a wife
whenever you want.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.624
What do i have in my life?

05:58.991 --> 06:03.246
- Boy, am i glad i called.
- Fuck you, then! Hang up!

06:03.246 --> 06:05.381
How are the whirlpool jets?
They get'em in right?

06:05.381 --> 06:09.001
Don't throw up in my face
things you buy me, okay?

06:09.385 --> 06:12.388
Her prosthetic leg
fell off in a gap store,

06:12.388 --> 06:15.391
and he carries her out
like a knight...

06:15.892 --> 06:17.894
in white satin armor.

06:18.394 --> 06:21.397
I gotta go.
Uh, my daughter's comin'.

06:23.766 --> 06:25.768
Jesus.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.911
Yeah. How ya feelin'?

06:34.911 --> 06:37.914
Oh, better, actually.
Fever just broke.

06:37.914 --> 06:39.916
I miss you two.

06:39.916 --> 06:42.418
How's the interviews
going?
Good.

06:42.418 --> 06:45.037
Real good.
Oh, yeah?
Did she like bates?

06:46.038 --> 06:48.541
Anything to get her
off of this berkeley kick.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.543
What the fuck?

06:52.545 --> 06:54.680
Tony?

06:55.181 --> 06:57.683
Yeah, yeah.
Look, i'll call you back
from the motel.

07:14.317 --> 07:16.319
Meadow! Come on!

07:24.710 --> 07:28.214
Come on.
Get in.
Okay, okay!
What's the rush?

07:30.716 --> 07:33.219
Geez, dad!

07:38.841 --> 07:43.095
- What's going on?
- I think i saw
an old friend, that's all.

07:43.095 --> 07:47.099
- You know that guy
at the gas station?
- Maybe not.

07:47.099 --> 07:49.485
- Probably not.
- Then what?

07:50.603 --> 07:52.104
Dad, slow down!

07:56.108 --> 07:58.995
Dad, jesus,
what's with you?

07:59.245 --> 08:00.746
- It's all right.
-
fucking maniac!

08:01.247 --> 08:03.749
- What's going on? -

08:04.116 --> 08:05.868
just foolin' around.

08:09.372 --> 08:12.875
Dad-- colby. Turn.

08:13.376 --> 08:15.378
Colby. Turn left.
It's to the left!

08:15.511 --> 08:17.513
Left!

08:17.513 --> 08:20.016
Dad!

08:20.016 --> 08:22.018
See? That's'cause you're
talkin' to me so much.

08:29.025 --> 08:31.894
Hey, this gets us
toward colby anyhow.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.034
Dad, that's our motel.

08:38.534 --> 08:40.653
Hello. Our motel's
right there.

08:46.158 --> 08:49.045
- Do you know that guy?
- Nah. It wasn't him.

08:59.922 --> 09:02.425
Bada- bing.

09:02.425 --> 09:05.928
- Take this number down
and call me back.
- Now? It's pourin' down here.

09:05.928 --> 09:08.431
207- 555- 0185.

09:10.066 --> 09:13.569
Mmm. Bonjour.

09:13.569 --> 09:16.072
Room service
et arrivee.

09:16.072 --> 09:18.074
Oop.

09:21.077 --> 09:23.079
Why, thank you,
kind sir.

09:27.583 --> 09:30.586
- What? You said
poached eggs. -

09:32.588 --> 09:34.590
you're not gonna eat'em now,
after all that work.

09:35.091 --> 09:38.094
I guess my eyes
were bigger
than my stomach.

09:45.101 --> 09:48.604
Anthony, why don't you
go over to jason's,
play nintendo?

09:50.606 --> 09:53.859
Nope. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No kisses. Cooties.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.861
I'll be back
in, like, an hour.

09:55.978 --> 09:57.980
Okay.

10:10.126 --> 10:12.628
Oh, motherfucker.

10:14.130 --> 10:16.632
A real fuckin' shit.

10:20.002 --> 10:23.506
Hey. I'm not sure,
but i think i just saw
fabian petrulio.

10:23.506 --> 10:26.008
Refresh my memory.
Was he before your time?

10:26.008 --> 10:30.012
Made guy. Flipped about
ten years ago when he
got busted for peddlin' "h."

10:30.012 --> 10:33.649
Rat fuck
took out a lot of people,
a lot of people from our outfit.

10:33.649 --> 10:36.652
My old man was sick.
He never recovered
when he heard the news.

10:36.652 --> 10:39.655
- You saw this guy?
- That's what i'm sayin'.

10:39.655 --> 10:43.159
- I think i did,
but i'm not sure.
- Up in maine? What the fuck?

10:43.159 --> 10:45.661
He went into
the witness protection program.
Then they kicked him out.

10:46.162 --> 10:48.664
Now he goes to colleges and
gets paid all kinds of money...

10:48.664 --> 10:50.666
to talk about what
a big, bad mafioso he was.

10:50.666 --> 10:53.169
- Piece of shit.
- Febbie and me partied
a couple of times,

10:53.169 --> 10:55.171
but jackie aprile
knew him good.

10:55.171 --> 10:57.173
They did a couple of counts
together up in lewisburg.

10:57.173 --> 11:00.176
You know that bust that was
in his rec room of sinatra?

11:00.176 --> 11:02.678
Febbie made it for him
in a prison workshop.

11:02.678 --> 11:06.048
That was frank, that bust?
I always thought
it was shaquille.

11:06.048 --> 11:09.051
Fucker needs to practice
a little on lips.

11:09.301 --> 11:12.304
Yeah, i know. Anyway,
run these plates for me.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.308
Go ahead.
Maine,

11:16.442 --> 11:19.945
d- x- 6- 6- 9- 2- 0.
Call you back tonight
at 10:00. all right?

11:23.449 --> 11:25.951
Hey.
What's wrong
with the phone in your room?

11:25.951 --> 11:29.955
Nothin'. Takin' a walk,
saw the phone. Figured i'd
give christopher a call.

11:29.955 --> 11:32.458
Oh, yeah?
Everything okay?
Yeah.

11:32.958 --> 11:35.461
Yeah. They got a leak
in the roof, though.
Is that all right?

11:35.461 --> 11:37.963
Uh- huh.
Huh?

11:41.050 --> 11:44.303
Who is it?
Father phil.

11:44.303 --> 11:46.305
Just a second.

11:46.806 --> 11:48.808
Oh, jesus.

12:12.448 --> 12:14.450
Oh, my god.
Look at you!

12:14.450 --> 12:16.952
Oy!
I hope i'm not
barging in.

12:17.086 --> 12:18.954
Oh, no, i was,
uh, watching tv.

12:18.954 --> 12:20.956
Oh. I was over
at the clothing drive,

12:20.956 --> 12:22.958
and i thought
you were up in maine.

12:22.958 --> 12:25.461
Oh.
By the way,
your marchino
pedal pusher suit,

12:25.461 --> 12:27.463
it just
flew out of there.

12:27.463 --> 12:29.465
Oh, good, good, good.

12:29.465 --> 12:31.467
So anyway, jean cusamano
said you were ill.

12:31.967 --> 12:34.470
Yes, i was. The flu
that was going around?

12:34.470 --> 12:38.474
Yipes.
Yeah. I still have
a little fever, but, uh--

12:38.474 --> 12:40.976
i also have
a confession
to make, carm.

12:40.976 --> 12:43.479
Uh--

12:45.981 --> 12:47.983
i- i have a jones
for your baked ziti.

12:47.983 --> 12:50.986
Oh.
Sure. Any time.

12:50.986 --> 12:52.988
I have some in the freezer.
I can reheat it.

12:52.988 --> 12:56.492
It's so much better that way,
isn't it? The mozzarella
gets all nice and chewy.

12:56.492 --> 12:58.994
I like that too.
I was having
a little fernet.
Yeah.

12:59.495 --> 13:02.998
- Settles the system.
Would you like something?
- Some wine, if it's open.

13:02.998 --> 13:06.502
Mm- hmm.
So, how's med and
tony's trip going?

13:06.502 --> 13:11.390
I should know? He doesn't have
time to talk to me for two
lousy minutes.
Oh, geez.

13:17.396 --> 13:19.398
Dad, stop staring.
Why are you doing that?

13:20.900 --> 13:22.902
It's an exciting time.

13:22.902 --> 13:27.907
I can't tell you
how proud i am of you.
A real student at casa soprano.

13:27.907 --> 13:30.910
And she looks like
one of the models right out
of italianvogue.

13:30.910 --> 13:34.413
Italian, italian, italian.
Thank you.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.917
You're definitely
up to something.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.419
Oof! How'd you get
so cynical?

13:47.176 --> 13:49.178
That stuff
we talked about before.

13:49.178 --> 13:53.182
- How's that sittin' with you?
- Like i wasn't 90% sure
already.

13:53.182 --> 13:56.685
- What about your brother?
Does he know?
- I think so.

13:58.187 --> 14:00.189
There was a time
when the italian people...

14:00.189 --> 14:03.192
didn't have
a lot of options.

14:03.192 --> 14:06.195
You mean like mario cuomo?

14:06.195 --> 14:09.198
Sorry.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.202
You know, i put food
on the table.

14:13.202 --> 14:16.205
My father was in it.
My uncle was in it.

14:16.205 --> 14:19.208
Maybe i was too lazy
to think for myself--

14:19.208 --> 14:23.212
consider myself a...rebel.

14:23.212 --> 14:26.715
Maybe being a rebel in my family
would have been sellin'
patio furniture on route 22.

14:29.718 --> 14:32.221
In college,
nothing interested you?

14:32.721 --> 14:35.224
Nah, i barely got in.

14:35.224 --> 14:38.227
Well,
kind of liked history.

14:38.227 --> 14:40.229
Yeah?
Yeah.

14:40.229 --> 14:42.731
Napoleon,
the roman empire.

14:42.731 --> 14:45.234
The potsdam conference--
that kind of thing.

14:45.234 --> 14:48.737
- What's the potsdam conference?
- Pots- damned if i know now.

14:48.737 --> 14:50.739
Oh, my god.

14:55.744 --> 14:58.747
Dad, i have something
to tell you.

14:58.747 --> 15:00.749
Yeah?

15:03.252 --> 15:06.755
- You're not--
- no! Jesus!

15:10.759 --> 15:15.264
A couple of weeks ago,
me and some friends,
we were doing speed.

15:15.264 --> 15:18.267
- We did kind of a lot
of it for a while.
- You what?

15:18.267 --> 15:20.769
It was just between
homework and sats...

15:21.270 --> 15:23.772
and just general
pressure of life.

15:23.772 --> 15:26.275
- We needed something
to keep going.
- That crap'll kill you.

15:26.275 --> 15:29.278
- I know.
- I oughta slap the shit outta
you. Where did you get it?

15:29.778 --> 15:32.781
If i thought
this was gonna be a lecture,
i never would have told you.

15:32.781 --> 15:36.785
Take a reality check. What do
you think i'm gonna say?
Where did you get it?

15:36.785 --> 15:40.289
No way i'm telling you,
especially after this reaction.

15:40.289 --> 15:43.292
Why did you tell me?

15:43.792 --> 15:48.297
You were honest with me today.
I won't be doing it again.
It got too scary.

15:49.298 --> 15:51.300
Jesus, right under my nose.

15:52.801 --> 15:54.803
You think you'd know.

15:54.803 --> 15:56.805
No, dad, you won't.

16:03.812 --> 16:06.815
I'm glad you told me,
in spite of everything.

16:07.816 --> 16:09.818
I'm glad i did too.

16:09.818 --> 16:11.820
I'm glad we have
that kind of relationship.

16:19.695 --> 16:22.197
Tony hates
building fires.

16:22.197 --> 16:24.199
We have
this beautiful fireplace,
and those same three logs...

16:24.700 --> 16:26.201
have been in there
since lincoln split them.

16:26.702 --> 16:29.705
Fear of fire.
Good deterrent
to keep out of hell.

16:29.705 --> 16:33.208
Maybe there is hope for him.

16:33.709 --> 16:36.095
Oh. I got something for you.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.097
That's what
we were talking about.

16:38.597 --> 16:40.599
The chapter on buddhism
is spectacular,

16:40.599 --> 16:43.102
but i don't want you going
over to those zany zennies.

16:43.602 --> 16:47.606
Fat chance. It's funny.
I could never just sit on
the floor and think of nothing.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.109
- Thank you.
- Sure.

16:50.109 --> 16:54.613
You'll see how islam
has gotten a bad rap
in current culture, and--

16:56.115 --> 16:58.984
boy, this chianti, though,
is beyond reproach.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.236
- Word up.
-

17:05.874 --> 17:08.743
dad.
Thought you fell in.

17:10.746 --> 17:13.248
This is carrie
and lucinda.
How ya doin'?

17:13.248 --> 17:16.251
- They go to colby.
- Yeah? Why don't you
hang out with them?

17:16.251 --> 17:19.755
- Dad.
- What better way to learn
about the college?

17:20.255 --> 17:22.257
Yeah, maybe, but--

17:22.257 --> 17:25.260
no, no,
that'd be cool.
Please excuse him.

17:25.260 --> 17:27.762
No, really.
We love to dish
the school.

17:28.262 --> 17:30.265
- Well--
- go ahead.

17:30.265 --> 17:32.768
Okay.
Now, med,
no drinkin'.

17:32.768 --> 17:35.771
Girls, you see
that she sticks
to cokes.

17:35.771 --> 17:39.274
I'll come back for you
in an hour and a half.
Be good.

17:46.165 --> 17:47.783
Yo.
What do you got?

17:47.783 --> 17:49.785
- Wet shoes.
- You chose this life.

17:50.285 --> 17:52.287
You don't want
to work in the rain,
try out for the yankees.

17:52.287 --> 17:54.790
The car is registered
to fredrick peters,

17:54.790 --> 17:57.793
38 washington street,
waterville, maine.

17:57.793 --> 18:00.796
It's off route 201.
I looked it up.

18:00.796 --> 18:04.800
Fredrick peters.
Fabian petrulio.
Good match, huh?

18:04.800 --> 18:08.687
I guess. I don't know.
T, what are you gonna do?

18:08.687 --> 18:11.190
I don't know.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.193
I got meadow here.
Jesus.

18:14.443 --> 18:17.696
Fuckin' nightmare. You want,
i'll fly up and take care of it.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.699
You're a good kid.
You stay put.

18:20.699 --> 18:23.702
- Maybe call pussy or paulie.
- What, they can do it,
but i can't?

18:23.702 --> 18:27.206
Don't be sensitive. They had
a friend, jimmy, die in prison
on account of this scumbag.

18:27.206 --> 18:31.710
- All right, i'll let'em know.
- Fuck, i gotta do my homework
and positively i. D. This guy.

18:31.710 --> 18:35.714
- I thought you said it was him.
- I haven't seen him in
12 years. I gotta make sure.

18:35.714 --> 18:38.717
All right, i'll call you
around midnight. Sit tight.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.727
You think
i'm a schnorrer,
don't you?

18:48.727 --> 18:51.730
A who?
Yiddish.

18:51.730 --> 18:55.234
It means somebody
who always shows up
in time for free grub.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.736
Well, you're here a lot.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.239
And you're a man.
You like to eat.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.743
I can't get over you
with that yiddish.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.746
Oh, that's, uh--
my neighborhood
in yonkers was mixed.

19:07.746 --> 19:09.748
Jewish and italian,
you know?

19:09.748 --> 19:11.750
Eh, a heady brew.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.752
What does that mean,
"heady"?

19:14.253 --> 19:16.255
Mmm. Melting pot.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.757
Some vigor.
Oh.

19:23.762 --> 19:26.765
Hello.
Hello.
I'm calling for tony soprano.

19:26.765 --> 19:29.768
Cajun stuffed olives?
Who can i say
is calling?

19:30.269 --> 19:33.272
- This is dr. Melfi.
- His nurse?

19:33.272 --> 19:36.275
No. Is--
is this mrs. Soprano?

19:36.275 --> 19:38.277
Uh, that's right.
And you are again?

19:38.277 --> 19:40.279
Jennifer melfi.
Dr. Melfi?

19:40.779 --> 19:43.282
Jennifer.
Lovely name.

19:44.783 --> 19:48.787
No, he's not home.
Could i impose
on you to, uh,

19:48.787 --> 19:51.790
to tell him that
i need to reschedule
monday's appointment.

19:51.790 --> 19:54.793
- I'm down with the flu.
- Does he have your number?

19:54.793 --> 19:59.298
- Let me give it to you in case.
- I lost my pencil, up his ass.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.300
I'll tell him
you called.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.810
Why does he have to lie?

20:11.810 --> 20:15.314
Why couldn't he tell me
his therapist is a woman?
What is he hiding?

20:15.814 --> 20:18.817
- Maybe he did tell you, and you
didn't hear him clearly.
- Oh, please.

20:18.817 --> 20:22.321
Here's your fernet.
Why wouldn't he tell me,
unless he's screwing her.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.823
Carmela, please.

20:25.324 --> 20:27.326
And i thought
he was changing.

20:27.326 --> 20:31.330
I thought therapy was gonna
clear up the fuckin' freak show
in his head.

20:31.330 --> 20:35.334
Carmela. I'm sure
you're wrong about them.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.836
Therapy is a start.

20:37.836 --> 20:41.340
It's a good start,
but, yes, it doesn't
fix the soul.

20:41.340 --> 20:44.843
He's gonna need help
from other sources
to repair that.

20:44.843 --> 20:47.346
Well, then you
talk to him.
You help him.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.348
But, well,
there you go.

20:49.848 --> 20:51.850
W- will he listen?

20:54.970 --> 20:57.973
He must be
a very unhappy man.
He's unhappy!

20:57.973 --> 21:00.475
Sleep is my number one--
aw, shit.

21:02.477 --> 21:04.980
Why go into it?

21:22.798 --> 21:25.417
Good thing
it's full of air bubbles.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.421
- Mommy?
- Yes, bear?

21:29.921 --> 21:32.424
Would you put me to bed?
I'm scared.

21:32.424 --> 21:35.427
- Sure, honey. Hold on.
- I thought
she was sleeping.

21:35.927 --> 21:38.930
Yeah, well, she woke up.
Daddy's gonna come too,
sweetie.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.316
We'll both
put you to bed.

21:41.316 --> 21:44.936
Hurry, daddy.
Yeah, yeah.

22:18.053 --> 22:21.056
These red pepper flakes
really make all the difference.

22:21.056 --> 22:23.058
Mm. Spicy.

22:23.058 --> 22:25.060
Good as willem dafoe was,

22:25.060 --> 22:28.063
i cannot picture
that jesus looked like him.

22:28.063 --> 22:30.949
Could you
pass the cheese?

22:30.949 --> 22:32.951
Not that he didn't do
a good job, willem dafoe,

22:32.951 --> 22:34.953
but the story's
confusing.

22:34.953 --> 22:37.456
So he gets down
offthe cross?

22:37.456 --> 22:39.958
Mm.

22:39.958 --> 22:42.461
You know, originally,
bobby d. Was supposed
to have that role?

22:42.461 --> 22:44.963
Really?
Oof.
Mm- hmm.

22:44.963 --> 22:47.466
- Different picture.
- Oh, totally.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.970
You talkin' to me, pilate?

22:52.471 --> 22:57.342
You must be talkin' to me,
'cause i don't see nobody else
here, except barabbas here.

22:57.843 --> 22:59.344
You know
what's remarkable?

22:59.845 --> 23:02.347
If you take everything
jesus ever said,

23:02.347 --> 23:04.850
add it up, it only amounts
to two hours of talk.

23:05.350 --> 23:07.352
No.
Mm- hmm.

23:07.352 --> 23:10.355
No, but wait.
I heard the same thing
about the beatles.

23:10.355 --> 23:13.859
Except it was
if you add up all their songs,
it only comes to ten hours.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.864
Yes.

23:21.867 --> 23:24.369
Of course, it wasn't
just what christ said.
It was his deeds.

23:24.369 --> 23:26.872
See, that's my question.

23:26.872 --> 23:30.876
I understand what he did,
but a lot of what he said,
i don't get.

23:30.876 --> 23:34.379
Like,"the sun rises on the just
and the unjust alike"?

23:34.379 --> 23:38.884
Why?
Because. Christ was
saying that we're all--

23:39.134 --> 23:41.636
that whores will go to heaven
before a lot of the righteous?

23:41.636 --> 23:43.638
Uh- huh.
That's
not right.

23:44.139 --> 23:47.142
Let's face it, father.
We got some major
contradictions here.

23:49.144 --> 23:52.647
- It's about love.
Think about it like that.
- What does that mean?

23:53.648 --> 23:57.152
It means,
hopefully, someday,

23:57.152 --> 23:59.654
we will learn to tolerate,

24:00.155 --> 24:03.158
accept and forgive
those that are different.

24:07.045 --> 24:09.047
Change through love.

24:16.555 --> 24:19.057
Well.

24:19.057 --> 24:21.676
Well-- oh, man,
i better get going.

24:21.676 --> 24:23.812
Where you going?
You just got here.

24:24.312 --> 24:25.814
It's getting late.

24:26.314 --> 24:28.316
But it's pourin' rain out.

24:28.316 --> 24:31.820
And i know
you love that dvd player.
I gotremains of the day.

24:31.937 --> 24:34.940
Hmm.
See?
Do i know you?

24:34.940 --> 24:38.443
Anything with
emma thompson, i'm there.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.579
Father phil,
i didn't know you looked.

24:40.695 --> 24:42.697
What?

24:42.697 --> 24:46.201
To take in through the eyes
a beautiful woman?

24:46.201 --> 24:50.705
Is that so different
than a sunset, a douglas fir,

24:51.089 --> 24:53.458
or any of god's
handiwork?

25:44.142 --> 25:46.645
Hey, fred.
Hey, tanky.
What do you say?

25:46.645 --> 25:49.147
You gonna give away
any homemade cheese
this year?

25:49.147 --> 25:52.150
For what they get
for cream, i don't know.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.152
Listen, tank,
anybody been lookin'
for me...

25:54.152 --> 25:56.154
or askin'
any questions
about me?

25:56.154 --> 25:59.157
Big guy.
New york sounding?
Is there a problem?

25:59.157 --> 26:04.663
No, no. Nah, dipshit
hit me with his boat while
i was tubin' on caribou lake.

26:05.664 --> 26:07.666
Claims it was
my fault.

26:07.666 --> 26:10.168
If he shows up,
you want me
to give you a call?

26:10.669 --> 26:12.671
Yeah, i wouldn't mind.
Do that. Thanks.

26:21.179 --> 26:23.181
You ready?
Yeah. Let's go.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.104
No one was asking
for you, fred.

27:19.104 --> 27:21.106
All right, vitus.
Thanks.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.620
Hello, rat.

28:44.906 --> 28:47.409
Please leave me alone,
miss kenton.

28:47.409 --> 28:49.911
Why won't you
show me your book?

28:49.911 --> 28:52.914
This is my private time.
You're invading it.

28:52.914 --> 28:54.916
Oh, is that so?
Yes.

28:54.916 --> 28:58.420
I'm invading
your private time, am i?
Yes.

28:58.420 --> 29:02.791
What's in that book?
Come on. Let me see.

29:03.792 --> 29:06.795
Or are you protecting me?
Is that what you're doing?

29:07.796 --> 29:10.048
Would i be shocked?

29:11.549 --> 29:14.552
Would it ruin
my character?

29:16.054 --> 29:18.056
Let me see it.

29:39.461 --> 29:41.463
Father, turn it off.
I can't handle it.

29:42.464 --> 29:44.466
What?

29:44.966 --> 29:47.469
What is it?
Oh, father,
i'm a terrible person.

29:47.469 --> 29:49.471
Oh, no.

29:50.472 --> 29:53.475
You're a wonderful woman.

29:53.475 --> 29:56.978
Oh, it's been
building in me.
I need to get it out.

29:56.978 --> 29:59.981
There's so much in me,
i wanna-- i wanna--

29:59.981 --> 30:02.484
carmela,
if i can help.

30:02.484 --> 30:04.486
Please.

30:07.489 --> 30:09.491
How?

30:15.497 --> 30:17.999
How long has it been
since you last confessed?

30:19.000 --> 30:22.003
Uh-- uh--
i, uh--

30:23.004 --> 30:25.006
if you like,
i can do this with you.

30:27.509 --> 30:29.511
You mean right here,
father? Now?

30:29.511 --> 30:32.514
The whole world
is god's house.

30:32.514 --> 30:34.516
He hears and sees
everything.

31:00.041 --> 31:02.544
Forgive me, father,
for i have sinned.

31:03.545 --> 31:06.548
It has been four weeks
since my last confess--

31:06.548 --> 31:10.552
what am i
talkin' about?
That's a lie.

31:10.552 --> 31:13.555
I haven't
truly confessed
in tw- twenty years.

31:17.058 --> 31:19.310
Go on.

31:20.311 --> 31:22.313
I have forsaken...

31:24.315 --> 31:28.319
what is right...
for what is easy,

31:31.823 --> 31:35.326
allowing what
i know is evil
in my house;

31:37.829 --> 31:39.831
allowing my children--

31:40.331 --> 31:42.834
oh, my god,
my sweet children--
to be a part of it...

31:43.785 --> 31:45.787
because i
wanted things
for them.

31:46.170 --> 31:49.173
Wanted a better life,
good schools.

31:49.173 --> 31:52.176
I wanted this house.

31:52.176 --> 31:56.180
Wanted money in my hands--
money to buy anything
i ever wanted.

31:56.180 --> 31:59.300
I'm so ashamed.

32:07.809 --> 32:09.811
My husband.

32:11.312 --> 32:14.816
I think he has committed
hor- horrible acts.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.705
I think he has-- you know
all about him, father phil.

32:20.705 --> 32:23.708
I'm the same.
I've said nothing.
I've done nothing about it.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.712
I got a bad feeling.

32:30.214 --> 32:32.717
It's just a matter of time
before god compensates me...

32:33.217 --> 32:35.720
with outrage
for my sins.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.105
All right, come on.

32:56.607 --> 32:59.110
Oh, tequila breath.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.112
Whew!
Sorry, dad.

33:01.112 --> 33:03.614
It's all right, kiddo.
Just hang onto me.

33:03.614 --> 33:05.616
Don't throw up
on that dress,

33:05.616 --> 33:07.618
or i'll have to tell
your mother everything.

33:07.618 --> 33:10.121
This guy was giving me
tequila shooters.

33:12.123 --> 33:16.627
Oh-- oh, god,
everything is spinning.

33:17.628 --> 33:19.597
You're not mad,
are you, daddy?

33:19.597 --> 33:21.599
Little bit.
Where are the keys?

33:21.599 --> 33:24.469
- I gave them to you.
-

33:24.969 --> 33:27.221
i love you, dad.
- I know.

33:38.232 --> 33:40.651
You must
truly repent,

33:40.651 --> 33:43.021
genuinely
and honestly.

33:44.956 --> 33:47.742
And in the future,
you must renounce
all these actions,

33:47.742 --> 33:49.627
and then god
will absolve you.

33:53.631 --> 33:55.633
I don't know, father.
I'll try.

33:57.635 --> 33:59.637
But i still love him.

34:01.089 --> 34:03.091
I still believe
he can be a good man.

34:03.474 --> 34:06.978
Then you help change him
into a better man,

34:07.478 --> 34:09.981
and then you will have
done good in god's eyes.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.154
I think you should
take communion.

34:17.405 --> 34:19.657
Yeah.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.674
Why do you
have that with you?

34:36.674 --> 34:39.677
Unfortunately i had
to say mass for someone
in intensive care.

34:45.433 --> 34:49.937
Lord, i am not worthy
to receive thee.

34:49.937 --> 34:51.938
But just say the word,

34:51.938 --> 34:54.442
and i will be healed.
And i will
be healed.

35:14.462 --> 35:16.831
This is
the body of christ.

35:16.831 --> 35:18.833
It was broken
for you.

35:31.095 --> 35:34.599
This is
the blood of christ.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.567
It was shed for you.

35:59.590 --> 36:03.461
Accept the spirit of christ,
our lord and savior.

36:03.961 --> 36:05.463
Amen.

36:05.463 --> 36:08.466
In the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit.

36:09.967 --> 36:12.470
Amen.

36:30.488 --> 36:33.241
Dad?

36:33.241 --> 36:36.244
I booked a seat on
a boston flight, tomorrow, 4:00.

36:36.244 --> 36:39.247
- Best i could get.
- Don't come.

36:39.747 --> 36:42.250
I'll make sure you
and meadow clear the state
before anything happens.

36:42.250 --> 36:44.752
We don't ever meet
face to face.
This is my thing.

36:44.752 --> 36:49.390
I am your soldier, antonio.
This is my duty, like we're
always talkin' about.

36:49.390 --> 36:52.894
The way this went down,
this is my call.

36:52.894 --> 36:54.896
I gotta vouch
for this myself.

36:54.896 --> 36:58.399
Clippin' a famous rat
would put me a cunt hair away
from bein' made.

36:58.399 --> 37:00.902
He might have recognized me
at the gas station.
He could lam anytime.

37:04.906 --> 37:06.908
You stay put.
End of discussion.

37:09.911 --> 37:11.913
Why are you using
the pay phone again?

37:12.413 --> 37:14.415
These walls are
like paper. I didn't
want to wake you up.

37:14.415 --> 37:17.418
Dad, please don't lie
to me.
Let's go back
to bed.

37:17.418 --> 37:19.420
Lying down
made me throw up.

37:48.816 --> 37:50.818
Hello.

37:51.819 --> 37:53.821
Oh, hi, honey.

37:55.323 --> 37:57.325
Oh, yeah.
Was it fun?

37:58.826 --> 38:00.828
Oh, good.

38:03.831 --> 38:06.334
Oh, you-- you wanna
sleep over there?

38:09.837 --> 38:12.340
Okay. Love you.

38:35.863 --> 38:38.366
That was a. J.

38:38.366 --> 38:41.369
He's sleepin' over.
Oh, i see.

38:44.872 --> 38:47.375
He's at
a friend's house.

38:47.875 --> 38:49.877
Oh.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.882
The pucillos.
I don't know
if you know them.

38:56.884 --> 38:58.886
No, i--

39:00.888 --> 39:03.391
oh.

39:04.392 --> 39:07.395
Oh-- oh, i--
what?

39:07.395 --> 39:10.031
Oh!
Are you all right?

39:22.543 --> 39:24.045
Father phil?

39:24.545 --> 39:26.547
Are you
all right?

39:50.154 --> 39:52.656
Hello.

39:53.157 --> 39:55.159
Hello?

40:32.613 --> 40:34.615
Ow! Don't!

40:36.617 --> 40:39.620
Wanna stop and get
a beer? Huh?

40:39.870 --> 40:41.489
No?

41:28.035 --> 41:30.671
I'll pick you up
in a little while.
You knock'em dead.

41:30.671 --> 41:33.874
- Aren't you coming in?
- No, i left my watch
at the motel.

41:34.375 --> 41:36.377
I'll catch up
to you later.

41:36.627 --> 41:39.513
Grab me a student paper.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.562
You should have
some coffee.

42:32.566 --> 42:34.568
Last night--
yep.

42:36.570 --> 42:39.073
We didn't
do anything
out of line?

42:39.073 --> 42:41.575
There's nothing
to apologize about.

42:43.577 --> 42:45.579
Right.
That's right.

42:48.082 --> 42:52.086
I should
get dressed,
get goin'.

42:52.086 --> 42:54.088
Anthony junior
will be home soon.

42:54.088 --> 42:58.592
Oh, my god. My car's
been out there all night
in plain sight.

42:58.592 --> 43:01.095
If we didn't do anything wrong,
we didn't do anything wrong.

43:01.595 --> 43:03.597
Is there a commandment
against eating ziti?

43:06.100 --> 43:08.102
It's okay.
Take a shower,
get dressed.

43:08.102 --> 43:11.105
Don't forget
your sacrament kit,
whatever.

43:12.606 --> 43:15.609
I'm home!

43:20.614 --> 43:22.866
Carmela.

43:24.368 --> 43:26.870
I don't know
where to begin.

43:30.874 --> 43:34.878
It's-- it's not
that i don't have desire
for you in my heart.

43:34.878 --> 43:37.381
Marrone, father, please.
But last night...

43:37.381 --> 43:40.384
was one of
the most difficult tests
from god ever for me.

43:40.384 --> 43:42.886
What are you
talkin' about?
We're friends.

43:45.389 --> 43:48.392
What's that look about?
What, i look some way?

43:53.897 --> 43:57.267
I was just thinkin'
about when we watched
casablancalast week.

43:58.268 --> 44:00.270
That new print
is great, huh?

44:01.772 --> 44:03.273
You know when bogie says,

44:03.774 --> 44:06.777
"of all the lousy gin joints
in the world, why'd she
have to pick mine?"

44:08.278 --> 44:10.781
Of all thefinukpriests
in the world,

44:10.781 --> 44:13.283
why did i have to get
the one who's straight?

44:15.285 --> 44:17.421
Carmela--

44:17.921 --> 44:19.923
come on. It's a joke.

44:40.944 --> 44:44.448
I would have done it
myself last night,
but some people came along.

44:44.448 --> 44:47.951
But anyway,
it's a gray town car, new model.

44:47.951 --> 44:50.454
You pick'em up
on the colby campus.
Stay on'em.

44:50.454 --> 44:52.456
Where on
the colby campus?

44:52.456 --> 44:55.459
What'd i just say?
His kid's applyin'.
The fuckin' admissions office.

44:55.459 --> 44:57.961
Oh. Okay.
You follow'em.

44:58.328 --> 45:00.330
An hour outta town,
you pull up alongside--

45:00.330 --> 45:02.332
- boom! Twelve- gauge.
- Fuck that.

45:02.332 --> 45:06.837
Do what i ask,
or you'll never get
another bag off me.

45:10.724 --> 45:14.595
No, no. Fuck that.
Fuck that!

45:14.595 --> 45:17.598
You want the cops
to find out who burnt down
the historical house?

45:17.598 --> 45:20.601
Fuck you,
fuck- wad!

45:20.601 --> 45:23.604
We were volunteer firemen
together, asshole! I know!

45:34.364 --> 45:36.366
Yeah, is dougy in?

47:30.480 --> 47:33.116
Good mornin', rat.
Who are you?
What is this?

47:33.617 --> 47:36.370
Don't make me laugh.
You pimp! You fuck!

47:36.870 --> 47:40.374
- Teddy, there must be
something we can do--
- tony. It's tony, you fuck.

47:40.374 --> 47:44.378
You know how much trouble
you're in now? You took
an oath, and you broke it!

47:44.378 --> 47:47.381
I could've
killed you last night,
outside the motel.

47:47.381 --> 47:50.884
Your daughter was drunk,
remember? I was there
in the parking lot.

47:50.884 --> 47:52.886
I had a gun,
but i didn't do it.

47:52.886 --> 47:55.505
Because of her,
i told myself,
"it's just a coincidence.

47:56.006 --> 47:58.508
He's takin'
his little girl to college."

47:58.759 --> 48:01.762
One thing about us wiseguys,
the hustle never ends.

48:02.262 --> 48:04.765
You shot me at that motel,
your life would've been
flushed down thepiscia- do!

48:05.148 --> 48:06.650
Please, tony, i'm begging!

48:09.653 --> 48:12.272
Jimmy says hello
from hell, you fuck!

49:44.948 --> 49:47.451
Where have you been?
I went back
to the motel,

49:47.951 --> 49:49.453
they didn't have the watch.

49:49.953 --> 49:52.956
So i went to the restaurant.
They was closed. I had
to wait for them to open.

49:53.457 --> 49:56.843
Restaurant had your watch?
I took it off in the bathroom
when i was washing my hands.

49:57.844 --> 50:00.714
You ready?
Don't wanna be late
for bowdoin.

50:15.395 --> 50:18.148
Dad, what's up with that?

50:20.650 --> 50:22.652
Oh, uh,
the restaurant.

50:23.653 --> 50:26.656
I tried the back door.
There were puddles.

50:30.160 --> 50:32.162
It was dumb.
I know.

50:37.167 --> 50:41.671
Your hand is bleeding.
Dad, where did you go?
You saw that man, didn't you?

50:41.671 --> 50:45.675
I cut it on a screen door.
What man?

50:45.675 --> 50:48.562
The man you said
you didn't know.

50:48.562 --> 50:50.564
Ah, va a napoli.
What do you think
happened?

50:50.564 --> 50:53.066
I don't know.
You got in a fight?
You don't know.

50:53.066 --> 50:55.569
You're makin'
a big deal outta this,
and you don't know.

50:55.569 --> 50:58.071
You were on the pay phone
again last night
at 1:00 in the morning.

50:58.071 --> 51:01.074
I was on the pay phone
at 1:00 in the morning?

51:01.074 --> 51:03.076
Excuse me,
miss cuervo anejo.

51:03.076 --> 51:07.581
You can't be trusted to remember
what happened last night, 'cause
you were seeing pink elephants.

51:08.081 --> 51:10.200
I warned you not to drink.

51:14.704 --> 51:18.208
Dad, you're being honest
with me, right?

51:18.458 --> 51:21.962
Pretty soon here
you're gonna start
hurtin' my feelings.

51:21.962 --> 51:25.348
- We have that kind
of relationship, you said.
- That's right.

51:25.348 --> 51:29.352
We do or we don't.
Takes two to tango.

51:32.355 --> 51:33.857
- Dad--
- what?

51:39.479 --> 51:41.481
Nothing.

51:49.489 --> 51:51.491
I love you.

51:51.491 --> 51:53.994
I love you too.

51:59.499 --> 52:01.001
Where's my paper?

52:01.251 --> 52:03.253
I forgot.
She forgot.

52:10.260 --> 52:12.262
Miss soprano,
come on in.

52:15.765 --> 52:18.902
Shall we talk
about your future?

53:08.285 --> 53:11.288
Oh, here they are,
the two ivy leaguers.

53:11.288 --> 53:13.790
Mwah! How was it?
Do you's want something to eat?

53:13.790 --> 53:15.792
It was good.
I gotta call hunter.

53:15.792 --> 53:18.295
Hey.

53:18.295 --> 53:21.298
Gee, she spared me
no boring detail.

53:21.298 --> 53:24.301
I'll be back.
What a trip.

53:24.301 --> 53:27.304
I'm beat.
What, new england?
It's so gorgeous.

53:27.304 --> 53:31.808
Hmm. You still sound
a little nasal,
but you look better.

53:32.175 --> 53:35.178
Any cold pasta?
There was some ziti,
but it all got eaten.

53:37.681 --> 53:39.683
The whole tray?
From last sunday?

53:41.184 --> 53:43.603
Monsignor jughead was here.

53:43.603 --> 53:46.606
If you are referring
to father intintola,
yes, he was.

53:46.606 --> 53:48.608
Hmm.

53:48.608 --> 53:51.611
He spent
the night here.
Yeah, right.

53:52.612 --> 53:54.614
Okay.

53:57.117 --> 54:00.620
- The priest spent the night
here. What happened?
- Nothing.

54:00.870 --> 54:04.507
- Where was anthony?
- He was sleeping over
at jason's.

54:04.624 --> 54:07.127
The priest spent the night here,

54:07.127 --> 54:10.130
nothin' happened, and you're
tellin' me this because--

54:10.513 --> 54:15.018
you might hear something,
take it the wrong way.
His car was out front all night.

54:15.518 --> 54:19.522
You know what?
This is too fucked up
for me even to think about.

54:25.028 --> 54:28.531
What'd you guys do
for 12 hours? Play,
uh,"name that pope"?

54:29.532 --> 54:32.535
He gave me
communion.

54:32.535 --> 54:35.288
- Oh, i'll bet
he gave you communion.
- Excuse me?

54:35.288 --> 54:39.292
The guy spends the night
here with you, and all
he does is slip you a wafer?

54:39.292 --> 54:41.795
That's verging on sacrilege.

54:41.795 --> 54:44.164
- Oh, i didn't mean to verge.
- You think i'm lying?

54:44.297 --> 54:46.800
I don't know,
but the whole thing sounds--

54:46.800 --> 54:49.302
would i have told you about it
voluntarily if there had been
anything to be ashamed of?

54:49.302 --> 54:52.305
Do i look like
the friggin' thornbird
over here?

54:52.305 --> 54:55.308
He's a fag. That's it.

54:55.308 --> 54:57.811
'Cause otherwise,
i gotta question
what i'm hearin' here.

54:59.312 --> 55:01.815
Oh, tony, you are a sketch.

55:05.318 --> 55:08.321
Oh, by the way,
your therapist called.

55:09.322 --> 55:12.826
Jennifer?

55:15.829 --> 55:17.947
Carm.

55:18.948 --> 55:20.950
I just thought you'd
think it was weird...

55:20.950 --> 55:23.203
if i saw a woman psychiatrist,
that's all.

55:24.704 --> 55:28.708
Carm, come on!
It's just therapy, that's all.
We just talk!
