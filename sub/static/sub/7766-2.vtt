09:00.999 --> 09:01.999

the one that met Brittany first,

more serious these days.

to hiring couples at Sur

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999

my husband,

his flavor of the week

09:39.999 --> 09:41.000

Good luck.

for Lisa, you think?

- I still cannot wrap
my head around

41:55.999 --> 41:56.999
how any of this
is my fault.

41:56.999 --> 41:59.999
- I just feel like,
with you and I at this point,

41:59.999 --> 42:01.999
I can't be friends
with all parties anymore.

Ariana's on the road again
where she's like,

42:03.999 --> 42:05.999
"If you're friends with Kristen,
then we're done."

42:05.999 --> 42:06.999
- I mean, then that's
the bottom line.

42:06.999 --> 42:09.999
Scheana wants this whole
situation with James

42:09.999 --> 42:11.999
to be my fault
because then that would save her

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
from being able to admit
that this is actually

42:13.999 --> 42:15.999
about Tom and Ariana.

42:15.999 --> 42:18.999
It's not my fault that your
friends do what they do.

42:18.999 --> 42:20.999
- It's not my fault either!
- It's not, Scheana.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
- It's not.
- I'm not saying that.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.999
- It's so hard
to be friends with you, like--

42:24.999 --> 42:25.999
- It's not hard to be friends
with me because...

42:25.999 --> 42:26.999
- But it is!

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
- Your friends fááá
my boyfriends

42:28.999 --> 42:29.999
and hook up
with my boyfriends.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
They're the ones putting you
in this position, not me.

I was just having a breakdown.
