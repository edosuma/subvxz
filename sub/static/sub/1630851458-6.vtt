WEBVTT

00:47.600 --> 00:48.560
You'll break it.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.320
Ah. It's the casing.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.240
The casing?

01:11.800 --> 01:14.520
The last bullet is jammed in the magazine.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.560
It could've blown off the whole barrel.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.880
Where did you learn that?

01:24.080 --> 01:25.040
On my own.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.400
You don't seem like you've been alone.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.200
Huh.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.320
Here.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.240
-What if it happens when I'm shooting?
-Huh.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.240
-Let's hope it doesn't happen.
-If it happens, I'd like to be remembered.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.760
The way you remember.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.720
Thank you.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.480
Who's there? Help.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.000
Help! Help!

02:43.840 --> 02:45.440
Help me!

02:46.160 --> 02:47.880
Help! Hilfe!

02:48.440 --> 02:51.080
Help! Can anyone… anyone hear me?

02:54.080 --> 02:57.040
Help! Help! Help!

02:57.120 --> 02:58.880
Help! Help!

02:59.400 --> 03:01.400
Hello? Hello?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.360
Hello?

03:10.880 --> 03:11.800
Help.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.600
Help. Help.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.160
Hello? Help. Help.

03:22.840 --> 03:24.160
Anyone there?

03:25.040 --> 03:26.880
Anyone there… Anyone there?

03:26.960 --> 03:29.160
Oh! Thank God.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.800
Thank God.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.680
Untie me. Please. Please untie me
before they get back.

03:33.760 --> 03:34.720
-Don't go.
-Sh.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.040
Don't go. Please. Wait!

04:32.640 --> 04:33.640
Please help me.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.000
You have mistaken me for someone else.
Please help me.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.200
Help me. Help me.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.880
Please, help me.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.880
Help me. Please.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.240
I had surgery this morning. Surgery.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.000
Do you understand me?

04:51.080 --> 04:53.640
Do you understand?
I've lost a lot of blood.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.040
I need to go to hospital.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.680
It was all a mistake.
You've mistaken me for someone else.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.080
-Don't waste your energy lying.
-You have mistaken me for someone else.

05:02.480 --> 05:05.160
I'm Johann Lehgen.
That's my name. I'm not lying.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.040
-I'm Johann Lehgen. That's my name.
-Since when? Since the war ended?

05:09.640 --> 05:11.280
I've never been anyone else.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.360
I swear to you.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.640
You're making a mistake.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.680
Maybe. Maybe not.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.000
If you let me go, I won't tell the police.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.400
-This is all a mistake.
-No, it's not.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.000
Help!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.800
Help me!

05:31.880 --> 05:33.160
Help. Help!

05:33.960 --> 05:37.360
Help! Help me! Help me! Help!

05:37.440 --> 05:38.520
I'm Johann Lehgen.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.400
You are Aribert Heim,
and I'm Isabel Riaza.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.440
Don't you remember me?

05:48.520 --> 05:52.240
No. I don't feel well.
I need to go to a hospital.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.000
That's not going to happen, Dr. Heim.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.160
What are you going to do?

06:14.880 --> 06:16.000
What?

06:17.960 --> 06:20.120
I'm gonna give Mr. Lehgen a chance.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.960
No. No!

06:23.480 --> 06:25.160
No, no, no.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.440
Please don't.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.080
Don't. No. No! No!

06:31.680 --> 06:33.320
No, no.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.240
No.

06:40.680 --> 06:44.440
This is what you did to everyone
when they came to the camp.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.920
You shaved their hair
and then you skinned them like animals.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.360
The first time I saw this scar,
I was ten years old.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.600
I have a scar. So what?

07:18.680 --> 07:20.360
Huh? So what?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.120
That means nothing.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.360
How many Germans
have a scar like this, huh?

07:26.440 --> 07:30.080
I remember every time I served your food
at the commander's table.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.400
And how after eating,
you would reach for one of those candies

07:33.480 --> 07:35.040
and put it in your mouth.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.720
And when you chewed it,
your scar would move.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.000
Who are you?

07:41.680 --> 07:42.760
Huh?

07:44.080 --> 07:45.080
Mossad?

07:46.040 --> 07:46.880
CIA?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.760
Aren't you not Johann Lehgen?

07:51.560 --> 07:54.000
You can't kill me
like they did with Eichmann.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.520
We'll see.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.760
You're Spanish?

07:57.280 --> 07:59.760
Spaniards were the toughest.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.080
They never gave up.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.200
Other people in the camp couldn't last.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.560
They would throw themselves against
the fence to electrocute themselves.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.520
Do you know
how many Spaniards died like that?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.280
Zero.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.200
Not one said, "I can't take it anymore."

08:17.280 --> 08:20.840
The Spaniards were
the most difficult to kill.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.880
Do you know how I know that?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.880
I kept a list of my experiments,

08:25.400 --> 08:27.800
and one of the pieces of data
I always wrote down

08:27.880 --> 08:31.480
was exactly how long the patient managed
to survive after the first test.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.000
The top 20 on the list,
they were all Spaniards.

08:37.640 --> 08:41.600
I remember one boy
where I skinned half his body,

08:41.680 --> 08:43.600
and he didn't even close his eyes.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.640
I got angry he wouldn't stop
looking at me.

09:43.720 --> 09:44.800
What was his name?

09:55.560 --> 09:57.000
My father was Eugenio.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.840
They were gonna name me
after my grandfather,

10:13.920 --> 10:16.640
but then my father insisted
on naming me after himself.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.760
It's the only thing I have of him.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.320
Motherfuckers.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.160
At least you have a photo.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.920
Those of us who were there
only have our memories.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.160
I would give anything
to spend a moment with him.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.920
I have a way to feel close to my father.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.240
I close my eyes.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.560
I imagine him before we left Spain.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.760
Before the war,
when everything was better.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.760
And I remember his smell.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.120
How rough his hands felt.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.560
And how happy he was
when he called my name.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.520
Miguel.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.760
A NETFLIX SERIES

14:21.160 --> 14:24.720
My father was killed
the day we arrived at the camp.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.400
I-- I'm sorry.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.840
No, you aren't sorry.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.000
EPISODE 6 - THE MILL

14:33.080 --> 14:34.440
Do you know who killed him?

14:35.800 --> 14:36.920
How could I know?

14:38.840 --> 14:40.760
Your friend Bachmann. He killed him.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.200
-Bad things happen in war.
-No, that was not war.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.960
My father didn't die
fighting other soldiers.

14:52.880 --> 14:57.200
My brother did not die
while fighting other soldiers.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.960
My brother was 15 years old.

15:05.560 --> 15:06.480
Riaza.

15:11.640 --> 15:12.920
Riaza…

15:15.760 --> 15:17.840
I remember Riaza in Mauthausen.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.600
Your brother?

15:22.320 --> 15:23.160
Yes.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.400
You have the same eyes.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.360
I remember when he looked at me.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.560
You're lying.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.680
-No.
-Yes.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.080
He was the one
I was telling you about before.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.080
You killed too many people.
You wouldn't remember one in particular.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.680
Some of you earned
a place of honor in my memory.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.680
Your brother…

15:50.200 --> 15:51.280
he did that.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.840
It took him so long to die.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.280
I suppose that's why I remember him.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.760
He should have been dead
within a few minutes.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.000
And he held on for days.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.680
I injected benzene into his heart.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.520
Sodium chloride, everything.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.800
And he just kept on living.
He kept on breathing.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.800
So back then,
I didn't know he had a little sister.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.360
Riaza.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.120
I wrote his name down in my notebook.

16:34.160 --> 16:39.240
You know, I skinned half of his body,
down to the bone, and he was still alive.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.760
-You're lying.
-His eyes…

16:43.120 --> 16:46.000
His eyes, I remember them well.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.520
Because they annoyed me.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.560
They were like yours.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.240
I had to take them out.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.920
I had to take them out!

17:17.080 --> 17:18.400
Something wrong, Isabel?

17:20.760 --> 17:22.160
I've never danced before.

17:25.640 --> 17:26.480
What?

17:45.480 --> 17:47.400
Music is like any other emotion.

17:52.960 --> 17:53.960
Like fear.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.480
Like cold.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.120
Like hunger.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.040
But feeling it
doesn't mean we can't control it.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.160
If anybody knows
how to control it, it's us.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.280
Hm?

19:59.760 --> 20:02.040
If you keep pulling,
you're going to hurt yourself, miss.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.680
Who are you? Untie me.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.120
That man is fucked up, miss.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.520
You can see that a mile away.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.760
-And you were going to kill him.
-I wasn't. He wants to die.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.680
-She was going to kill me.
-That makes no sense.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.800
I haven't thank you yet
for saving my life.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.840
-Thanks.
-If you think I'm going to kill him,

20:18.920 --> 20:20.240
you can take my gun.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.120
-You can take it, but untie me now.
-I don't think so.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.280
The best thing to do

20:24.360 --> 20:26.200
-is go to the Civil Guard station.
-No, no, no.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.800
-They'll know what to do.
-No, no, no.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.800
-Why not? It seems sensible.
-They'll release him.

20:29.880 --> 20:33.120
-He's a murderer.
-If so, the Civil Guard will arrest him.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.400
-This man's name is Aribert Heim.
-No, no.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.680
-My name's Johann Lehgen. I'm a professor.
-They call him the Butcher of Mauthausen.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.480
-At the university.
-Doctor Death.

20:41.560 --> 20:43.240
-Take me to hospital.
-You know him.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.080
Please. Help me. Help me.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.680
-I need a doctor.
-Know what he did to the prisoners?

20:47.760 --> 20:49.560
-Lies
-He skinned them alive.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.800
He had a notebook

20:50.880 --> 20:53.040
where he wrote down
how long it took them to die.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.120
He did it to children!

20:54.720 --> 20:56.640
-He injected toxins into their hearts.
-A lie.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.360
Ammonia. Benzene!

20:58.440 --> 21:00.920
-She's lying.
-What kind of person would do that?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.600
-He's a murderer.
-I'm a scientist!

21:03.280 --> 21:05.320
-You did all that?
-For science.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.880
Everybody has reasons they go to war.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.760
The harm I did to those people

21:13.440 --> 21:15.560
-saved many more lives.
-You can't let him go.

21:15.640 --> 21:20.720
Isabel, science needs some people to die
so we can cure the living.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.360
What about all the Jews you killed
just because they were Jews?

21:23.440 --> 21:24.560
Because of their religion?

21:24.640 --> 21:28.040
The Jews were the obsession
of Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels…

21:28.640 --> 21:30.880
What I did was
to get something good out of their deaths.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.280
What did my brother teach you,
you son of a bitch?

21:34.080 --> 21:36.640
What did he teach you
while you were tearing his skin to shreds

21:36.720 --> 21:38.920
and pulling his eyes out of their sockets?

21:39.520 --> 21:41.840
We gave you special treatment.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.800
You son of a bitch.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.400
Thanks to those experiments,
we made major advances in medicine.

21:47.480 --> 21:51.560
I saved lives and helped save many more.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.960
Why don't you ask her? Huh?

21:58.240 --> 21:59.080
Isabel.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.840
Did your wound heal well? Hm?

22:03.080 --> 22:04.920
Why don't you show him your scar?

22:06.440 --> 22:08.800
Check her side. Go on, have a look.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.200
You'll feel better again soon.
You're in good hands.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.760
I don't want to keep you
from your research, Dr. Heim.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.120
Don't worry, Major.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.720
Is she really worth it? She's only a maid.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.080
Trust me.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.440
I decided to save your life.

23:16.360 --> 23:19.920
I was able to do so because of
what I learned from the people I killed.

23:29.040 --> 23:29.920
You didn't save me.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.120
You condemned me.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.760
You murdered my entire family.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.080
My father.

23:41.880 --> 23:42.880
My brother.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.280
They were all I had in the world.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.680
You know what the worst part is?

23:53.000 --> 23:56.040
That there is nowhere I can go
to mourn them.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.320
Nobody remembers them.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.520
When I die,
it'll be like they never existed.

24:17.920 --> 24:21.880
Yet here you are.
You're only alive because of me, Isabel.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.600
I'm alive?

24:29.640 --> 24:32.160
Life in Mauthausen was a living hell.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.720
And when you come out of that place,
you think the worst is over,

24:40.560 --> 24:42.880
that you can be a person
like everyone else.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.920
But you realize that you're not.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.800
You're not like everyone else anymore.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.400
What you did to us will haunt us forever.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.440
You took everything from us.

25:04.760 --> 25:08.080
Even our own feelings, deep inside.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.520
And you can't get that back.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.520
So no, I'm not going to thank you
for saving my life.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.720
I'm going to die.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.480
Please. I need you
to take me to a hospital.

25:23.560 --> 25:27.640
I can buy him some time, but you have to
get the first-aid kit from the ambulance.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.200
Don't trust--

25:30.280 --> 25:32.600
-He must be judged for what he did.
-Don't trust her.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.600
That's why he has to live.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.840
Don't trust her.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.680
You and I are not so different.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.800
We're both alone.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.520
We're both victims of war, Isabel.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.320
Are you?

25:54.720 --> 25:57.040
-Are you a victim?
-In a different way.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.920
I've been hiding for a long time.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.120
On the run.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.160
Like you.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.320
The difference is that there's
a good reason to chase you.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.160
We aren't criminals.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.360
I won't make it to that trial alive.

26:13.440 --> 26:16.160
You know that as well as I do.

27:45.320 --> 27:46.480
"J'attendrai."

27:51.440 --> 27:54.080
It's been years
since I listened to that song.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.400
"I will wait for you."

27:59.760 --> 28:00.920
"Day and night."

28:02.320 --> 28:04.000
"Wait for you to come back."

28:06.000 --> 28:09.640
You forced them to sing it while they led
their comrades to the gallows.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.680
They're going to judge you.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.480
And when they condemn you,

28:21.880 --> 28:23.080
I'll sing it to you.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.960
No. No, no.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.600
Not now. Not now. Not now!

28:44.600 --> 28:45.440
God damn it!

28:47.080 --> 28:49.680
-Come on.
-Come on, quick. Come on.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.440
I hope someday
you get justice for your family, miss.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.280
Oh, okay.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.280
Okay. Oh, God.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.200
I was saving these bullets.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.000
They have the name of my father's
and brother's murderer on them.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.440
I don't need them anymore.

30:29.320 --> 30:32.640
We need to protect ourselves.
No one is going to thank us for this.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.600
No one is going to remember us, Isabel.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.600
Jaguar.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.080
What?

30:48.440 --> 30:51.880
-You know who Cristino García Granda is?
-No.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.800
In France, he's a hero.
In Spain, he was executed.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.400
He and I were in the same outfit.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.960
-Hm.
-We risked our lives there.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.000
And nobody here remembers us.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.000
And I didn't understand…

31:05.080 --> 31:08.560
…why Cristino didn't care, until one day,
the bastard told me a long story

31:08.640 --> 31:11.240
about some Mexican warriors
called the "Jaguars."

31:11.320 --> 31:12.640
-Who?
-The Jaguars.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.800
Twelfth-century Aztec warriors
who fought for their people.

31:16.880 --> 31:20.200
They came from the people and they were
willing to die for their people.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.480
And then, there were
the other warriors of a higher rank,

31:23.560 --> 31:25.160
the Eagles, who were the elite.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.600
They never fought on the front lines,

31:28.320 --> 31:30.520
but they always got all the recognition.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.600
Whereas the Jaguars died
fighting for their people

31:35.680 --> 31:37.080
in complete anonymity.

31:39.320 --> 31:40.320
We're like them.

31:41.720 --> 31:42.720
We don't seek glory.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.280
We seek freedom.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.280
There will always be Eagles.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.120
And we'll always be Jaguars.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.520
Why are you smiling?

32:15.360 --> 32:17.160
"We swear before the whole world…

32:19.600 --> 32:23.320
in this public square,
this place of fascist cruelty…

32:26.760 --> 32:28.840
that we will never give up the struggle

32:28.920 --> 32:33.160
until the last of the guilty stand
before us and are judged by the people."

32:37.760 --> 32:40.480
You have the same blood as me.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.120
Tough luck for both of us.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.760
Isabel.

32:51.840 --> 32:52.920
Isabel!

32:53.560 --> 32:54.440
Is--

32:58.160 --> 33:01.160
Listen to me. Listen--

34:07.560 --> 34:08.760
I'm okay.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.760
I'm okay. I'm okay.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.360
-Where's Lucena?
-I don't know.

34:59.720 --> 35:00.600
Listen.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.680
I love this music.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.240
I believe in God, the Father Almighty…

36:39.760 --> 36:44.320
Creator of Heaven and Earth,
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son,

36:45.160 --> 36:46.280
our Lord,

36:47.440 --> 36:49.880
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,

36:50.600 --> 36:53.560
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,

36:53.640 --> 36:55.880
was crucified, died, and was buried.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.720
He descended into Hell.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.120
On the third day,
He rose again from the dead.

37:00.640 --> 37:01.920
He ascended into Heaven

37:02.000 --> 37:04.960
and is seated at the right hand
of God the Father Almighty.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.720
From there He will come
to judge the living and the dead.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.360
I believe in the Holy Spirit,

37:12.680 --> 37:15.600
the holy Catholic Church,
the communion of saints…

37:23.920 --> 37:26.840
…the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,

37:26.920 --> 37:28.280
and life everlasting.

37:32.080 --> 37:32.920
Amen.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.400
-Hello?
-Colonel Aguado?

39:43.240 --> 39:44.120
Yes.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.800
I would like to get contact
with Otto Bachmann.

39:49.640 --> 39:50.640
Who are you?

39:54.080 --> 39:55.440
You can call me Jaguar.
