00:05.785 --> 00:07.806
Some days is just like
any another day.

00:08.686 --> 00:10.006
Come on, Sean.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.254
Let's hear about
everybody's day. I'll go first.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.692
I went to work,
filled my purse with doughnuts,

00:14.727 --> 00:17.476
- Didn't sell a car, came home.
- There's doughnuts?

00:17.511 --> 00:19.842
Sorry. I hit a lot
of red lights on the way back.

00:19.877 --> 00:22.480
- All right, next.
- I didn't make the chess team.

00:22.651 --> 00:25.460
Turns out,
it's nothing like checkers.

00:25.981 --> 00:28.258
I finally sneezed
this eraser out of my nose.

00:28.293 --> 00:30.660
I did stuff. Whatever.

00:31.220 --> 00:32.921
I found a dinosaur bone.

00:34.577 --> 00:35.614
What?

00:35.649 --> 00:38.260
<i>Then again,
some days really surprise you.</i>

00:38.295 --> 00:40.042
Yeah, I was in
the south end of the quarry,

00:40.077 --> 00:41.129
And all of a sudden
I look down,

00:41.164 --> 00:43.998
And there's
this gnarled claw bone thing.

00:44.554 --> 00:45.658
Awesome!

00:45.693 --> 00:46.734
- Cool!
- That's not lame.

00:46.769 --> 00:49.435
At the commuty college,
have them come pick it up.

00:49.470 --> 00:52.734
What? You're gonna let them
take credit for your discovery?

00:52.769 --> 00:54.438
Mike,
this is a big deal.

00:54.473 --> 00:56.112
Dad, you should ll
the "ors herald."

00:56.147 --> 00:58.576
Maybe they'll put
your picture in the paper.

00:58.611 --> 01:00.636
Oh, they don't want
my picture in the paper.

01:00.671 --> 01:02.631
Well, they did that
whole article on the guy

01:02.666 --> 01:04.879
Who found the chicken nugget
shaped like texas.

01:05.056 --> 01:06.582
<i>I think you'll get in.</i>

01:06.890 --> 01:08.948
So mike called
the "orson herald"...

01:08.983 --> 01:10.503
<i>who called the local news...</i>

01:10.538 --> 01:12.349
<i>who called
the national news...</i>

01:12.384 --> 01:13.542
<i>and just like that...</i>

01:13.577 --> 01:15.555
So we gotta shut down
for four months

01:15.590 --> 01:18.540
To let
the paleontologists dig.

01:18.718 --> 01:20.591
<i>mike was out of a job.</i>

01:22.338 --> 01:24.148
Oh, you're home early.

01:24.183 --> 01:26.742
And you made dinner.
What a nice surprise.

01:26.777 --> 01:28.998
Yeah, well, it's really
more of a bad surprise.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.827
Aw, you forgot ketchup.
Ohh, this sucks!

01:32.862 --> 01:34.386
I'm out of a job.

01:34.578 --> 01:37.323
- What?
- Wait! found it.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.055
It was under
the french fries.

01:39.090 --> 01:40.901
They're closing the quarry down
for a few months

01:40.936 --> 01:43.172
So scientists can come in
and dig up the rest of it.

01:43.173 --> 01:44.828
- Dude!
- Yeah.

01:44.863 --> 01:48.509
Oh, my god. You lost your job.
Are we gonna be okay?

01:48.544 --> 01:49.756
Don't worry.
It's just a few months.

01:49.757 --> 01:51.019
We'll be fine.

01:51.054 --> 01:52.583
- Absolutely.
- Nothing to worry about.

01:52.618 --> 01:54.296
Hey, mike, can I see you
in the kitchen for a sec?

01:54.297 --> 01:55.612
Okay.

01:58.745 --> 02:00.628
Oh my God, Mike,
we are screwed.

02:00.663 --> 02:03.562
Oh, yeah. I would not
want to be us right now.

02:03.938 --> 02:06.160
At the dealership.

02:06.161 --> 02:08.229
That's just something I say
when the kids are in the room.

02:08.264 --> 02:10.524
We can't afford you being
out of work right now.

02:10.559 --> 02:11.730
What are you gonna do?

02:11.731 --> 02:14.118
Well, I thought
I might travel a little bit,

02:14.153 --> 02:16.401
Bike around europe.
What do you think I'm gonna do?

02:16.436 --> 02:18.452
I'm gonna find another job.
I got a lot of skills.

02:18.487 --> 02:21.800
- I'm not worried.
- Okay. then I'm not either.

02:25.038 --> 02:26.718
Mom, sign this.

02:30.082 --> 02:32.494
You're running
for school historian?

02:32.529 --> 02:34.702
What? I thought
you'd want me to run.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.493
Brick, every time
you sign up for something,

02:36.528 --> 02:38.830
- I end up doing it.
- That's not true.

02:38.865 --> 02:40.976
Mom, I entered
the science fair.

02:47.636 --> 02:50.418
We're having a party
for mr. Peterson's retirement.

02:50.453 --> 02:52.298
I signed up
to write him a song.

02:52.333 --> 02:55.960
# mr. Peterson,
you were really fun #

02:55.995 --> 03:00.644
# we're gonna miss you a ton,
mr. Peter-son #

03:04.790 --> 03:06.594
You won't have to do
a thing this time.

03:06.629 --> 03:09.523
I promise. All I need
is your signature.

03:09.558 --> 03:11.800
<i>Or I could have axl do
your signature.</i>

03:11.835 --> 03:13.382
He's really good at it.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.268
Hey, here's a job.

03:20.394 --> 03:22.570
"paleontologist's assistant.

03:22.605 --> 03:24.480
Must have master's degree."

03:24.481 --> 03:26.794
It's not fair.
You're totally qualified.

03:26.829 --> 03:28.182
You found the damn thing.

03:28.217 --> 03:30.391
Trust me, dad. I've been looking.
There's no jobs out there,

03:30.426 --> 03:31.994
No matter how awesome
you may be.

03:33.824 --> 03:36.570
Seriously, I texted my resume to,
like, Three places last week.

03:36.605 --> 03:38.903
You can't just text
your resume places.

03:38.938 --> 03:40.410
Times like these,
you gotta get out there,

03:40.445 --> 03:42.585
<i>Work the shoe leather.
Finding a job is a job.</i>

03:42.586 --> 03:44.586
I'd like to quit that job.

03:44.621 --> 03:46.836
Well, the only way to quit
that job is to get a job,

03:46.871 --> 03:48.474
And that's why
you're going with me

03:48.509 --> 03:50.556
To the orson job fair
this weekend.

03:50.591 --> 03:53.360
Oh, god! When do
I get time for myself?

03:53.395 --> 03:56.166
Job fair?
More like unfair.

03:58.912 --> 04:01.418
When a fine young man
like that can't get a job,

04:01.453 --> 04:03.690
What hope is there
for the rest of us?

04:06.780 --> 04:09.200
<i>And so mike was
officially on the job hunt.</i>

04:09.235 --> 04:12.836
<i>And he did look pretty snazzy
in his funeral blazer.</i>

04:12.837 --> 04:14.494
This is a line just to get in.

04:14.529 --> 04:16.779
Lot of people looking
for jobs.

04:16.814 --> 04:19.557
This is lame.
I'm the only one here under 100.

04:19.558 --> 04:21.052
hey, where's your resumes?

04:21.087 --> 04:22.708
How do you expect
to get any interviews?

04:22.709 --> 04:23.828
Dude, I'm on an interview
right now

04:23.863 --> 04:25.008
With the guy
from the movie theater.

04:25.043 --> 04:27.132
Do you want to see a picture
of his dog puking?

04:27.564 --> 04:30.576
Oh, look.
It's indiana bones.

04:30.998 --> 04:32.802
If you find anything
on the ground,

04:32.837 --> 04:34.770
Don't tell this guy.

04:37.658 --> 04:40.785
My interview's going great.
How do you spell "scrotum"?

04:45.704 --> 04:47.272
Aw, brick.

04:47.307 --> 04:49.917
This says your campaign flyers
are due tomorrow.

04:49.952 --> 04:51.035
Oh, really?

04:51.070 --> 04:53.209
Flyers are super important,
brick.

04:53.244 --> 04:56.236
I did flyers when I lost
for student council,

04:56.271 --> 04:57.952
And when I lost
for teen board,

04:57.987 --> 05:00.814
And when I lost for
junior high homecoming court.

05:00.849 --> 05:02.278
I just don't think
you get it.

05:02.279 --> 05:04.186
But I can't get 'em done
by tomorrow.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.868
I need paper
and a copier and...

05:07.502 --> 05:09.696
Oh, no.
Whatm I gonna do?

05:09.731 --> 05:12.412
oh, no.
Don't look at me.

05:12.447 --> 05:13.942
If you forgot
to make flyers,

05:13.977 --> 05:16.381
Then I guess you'll just be
the candidate without flyers.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.407
You know the deal, pal!
You are on your own.

05:19.442 --> 05:21.594
I am not doing it.

05:28.230 --> 05:30.832
Ooh, personal copies
on company time.

05:30.833 --> 05:32.570
- That is like a bad girl.
- Yeah.

05:32.571 --> 05:35.376
Momy likes to keep her job,
So could you watch the door?

05:35.411 --> 05:37.082
Sure. Don't worry.
I'm cool.

05:37.117 --> 05:39.206
sometimes
I sit on mr. Ehlert's desk

05:39.241 --> 05:40.922
With no pants on.

05:40.957 --> 05:44.272
Yep, every day,
a little victory.

05:48.944 --> 05:52.147
No funnel cake, no rides...
oh, this fair sucks!

05:52.182 --> 05:54.088
Let's just get our jobs
and get out of here.

05:54.123 --> 05:56.712
Axl, this is what you gotta do
to get a job.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.497
Now watch and learn.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.175
Welcome to cfb consulting.

06:00.210 --> 06:02.776
I'm charles f. Barnes,
a.K.A. "cfb."

06:02.811 --> 06:03.953
Hi. Mike heck.

06:03.954 --> 06:05.765
Well, mike,
let's see that resume.

06:08.605 --> 06:10.848
First of all, I'd say
you have a major font problem.

06:10.849 --> 06:11.970
What?

06:12.005 --> 06:13.567
Oh, it's a little dry.
Now I can give your resume

06:13.602 --> 06:15.984
A complete makeover for $100.
Now if you want

06:16.019 --> 06:17.860
A more comprehensive
career consultation,

06:17.895 --> 06:19.930
My weekend packages start
at $500.

06:19.965 --> 06:22.345
That's a better price than
any of these other booths.

06:22.346 --> 06:24.213
Wait.

06:27.157 --> 06:29.622
This is a racket.
There are no jobs here.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.316
You just lure people
who are out of work,

06:31.351 --> 06:33.714
So you can sell 'em crap
they can't afford.

06:33.749 --> 06:35.818
Just trying
to make a living.

06:38.008 --> 06:39.750
Told you, dad.
That's not how you get a job.

06:39.751 --> 06:41.322
There wasn't anything else
in the paper.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.369
Paper?
oh, that's hilarious.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.831
You know
how I got my last job?

06:44.866 --> 06:46.651
My friend on facebook
friended this other dude

06:46.686 --> 06:47.745
Who I.M.'ed me saying,

06:47.780 --> 06:49.395
"hey, you want
this stupid job at barnacles?"

06:49.430 --> 06:51.978
And I'm like...
"sweet."

06:53.125 --> 06:55.216
I can stop worrying
about america now.

06:55.251 --> 06:58.050
that's how it's done, dad.
<i>You gotta get online.</i>

06:59.599 --> 07:00.695
Right about then,

07:00.730 --> 07:03.813
<i>Mike was starting to feel
a bit like a dinosaur himself.</i>

07:03.848 --> 07:06.369
- Axl!
- What?

07:06.404 --> 07:08.497
This company's taking
job applications online.

07:08.532 --> 07:10.245
I need your help.

07:10.461 --> 07:13.013
You need a consult
with the ax man, do ya?

07:13.048 --> 07:14.555
Yeah. I'm never calling
you that.

07:14.590 --> 07:17.501
How do I get this
onto that?

07:17.536 --> 07:19.529
save it as a p.D.F.
And upload it.

07:27.305 --> 07:28.807
There.

07:28.842 --> 07:31.133
That's it? Thanks.

07:32.135 --> 07:33.514
Axl!

07:33.730 --> 07:36.607
What?

07:36.642 --> 07:38.889
They need a e-mail address,
and I only have the one at work,

07:38.924 --> 07:40.727
And that's down,
so what's yours?

07:40.762 --> 07:43.113
Rockinfreakshow@grungemail.Com.

07:50.227 --> 07:51.937
Here's your flyers.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.543
I'm out.

07:54.823 --> 07:57.327
Wait. You're actually doing
your poster on your own?

07:57.362 --> 07:58.531
Yep.

07:58.566 --> 08:00.543
And... I'm done.

08:02.995 --> 08:04.297
<i>Walk away.</i>

08:04.332 --> 08:07.047
<i>Just turn arnd
and walk away.</i>

08:08.955 --> 08:10.257
Axl.

08:10.258 --> 08:11.753
What?

08:11.788 --> 08:14.365
- I got a interview.
- Sweet.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.582
You got an interview?

08:15.617 --> 08:18.385
Yes, I did.
Honey, get me my tie.

08:18.420 --> 08:21.739
Okay, but what are we gonna yank
to turn the basement light on?

08:21.774 --> 08:23.975
Once I get this job,
baby, I'm gonna get you

08:23.976 --> 08:27.107
the best basement light bulb
money can buy.

08:28.907 --> 08:30.735
Hi. I'm mike heck.

08:30.770 --> 08:33.345
Ah, yes.
The rockin' freak show.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.847
Please, sit down.

08:35.337 --> 08:37.517
So tell me, mike,

08:37.552 --> 08:39.482
What brings you
to hoosier grain?

08:39.518 --> 08:41.451
Well, you called me,
told me to come in,

08:41.486 --> 08:42.703
And, uh, here I am.

08:42.738 --> 08:46.028
Okay. How about you tell me
a little about you?

08:46.251 --> 08:48.887
What are three words
you would use

08:48.922 --> 08:50.285
To describe yourself?

08:50.320 --> 08:52.713
Uh... Tall...

08:55.093 --> 08:56.392
Mike...

08:58.295 --> 08:59.632
Man?

08:59.667 --> 09:00.725
Okay.

09:00.760 --> 09:04.541
Well, what would you say
is your best quality?

09:05.853 --> 09:07.041
Tall?

09:07.076 --> 09:08.653
What's your worst quality?

09:08.688 --> 09:10.257
Why would I tell you that?

09:10.292 --> 09:12.293
That'd be stupid, right? I mean,
I'm trying to get a job here.

09:12.328 --> 09:16.764
if you were a color,
what color would you be?

09:17.759 --> 09:19.587
I guess I would stick
with the color I am.

09:19.622 --> 09:21.377
Are you even allowed
to ask me that?

09:21.412 --> 09:24.372
<i>See, mike just couldn't play
the game the way you have to</i>

09:24.407 --> 09:26.291
<i>In an interview.
He just didn't have it in him.</i>

09:26.292 --> 09:28.249
Look, I be a manager,
I'm a hardworker,

09:28.284 --> 09:31.289
I've never been late in my life.
What else do you need to know?

09:31.735 --> 09:34.879
What superhero quality
would you find

09:34.914 --> 09:36.923
Most valuable to you
in the workplace.

09:36.958 --> 09:39.179
Flying, invisibility

09:39.214 --> 09:42.787
<i>Or stretching
to extreme lengths?</i>

09:48.637 --> 09:50.493
<i>So brick forgot the flyers.</i>

09:50.528 --> 09:52.177
<i>Big surprise.</i>

09:52.212 --> 09:54.049
<i>I guess kinda my fault,
'cause I put them</i>

09:54.084 --> 09:57.281
<i>On top of his backpack
instead of inside it.</i>

09:57.316 --> 09:59.255
<i>When will I learn?</i>

10:02.456 --> 10:04.956
<i>Oddly enough,
whoever defaced the poster</i>

10:04.991 --> 10:06.927
<i>Put more work into it
than brick did.</i>

10:10.442 --> 10:12.125
Hey, pigtails.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.218
This your handiwork?

10:13.253 --> 10:15.921
No,
but it is pretty funny.

10:15.956 --> 10:18.560
You think it's funny, huh?
I n't think it's funny.

10:18.595 --> 10:20.876
You know why?
'cause brick's not a nerd.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.572
Doesn't make sense.
Not a good joke.

10:22.607 --> 10:25.456
Unless it's ironic.
Is that why you're laughing?

10:25.491 --> 10:28.358
Because of the extreme
not-nerdiness of my son?

10:28.966 --> 10:30.468
Are you a teacher?

10:31.090 --> 10:34.072
Yeah, you wish
I was a teacher.

10:34.522 --> 10:39.464
Your school laws don't
apply to me... Megan.

10:40.628 --> 10:43.348
So I assume brick can count
on your vote for historian.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.952
<i>Oh, yeah.
I'm in this thing now.</i>

10:56.578 --> 10:57.598
Okay, not too neat.

10:57.633 --> 10:59.714
It's gotta look like
an 8-year-old made it.

10:59.749 --> 11:01.788
Frankie, I took
advanced charcoal sketch

11:01.823 --> 11:04.890
At the learning annex.
I can't unteach my hands.

11:05.270 --> 11:06.806
Mom, I found some more markers
in the basement.

11:06.807 --> 11:07.842
Oh, good.

11:07.877 --> 11:09.274
And I couldn't find
any clean poster board...

11:09.309 --> 11:10.778
So I brought
some of my old ones.

11:10.813 --> 11:12.320
We can use the other side.

11:13.788 --> 11:16.253
Look. I put so much work
into these,

11:16.288 --> 11:18.932
And vicky hanson grows boobs,
and it's all over.

11:19.382 --> 11:20.618
I was robbed.

11:20.653 --> 11:23.498
<i>frankie,
do you want a glitter border,</i>

11:23.533 --> 11:26.242
<i>- Or is that too much?
- I think that is too much.</i>

11:27.826 --> 11:29.798
<i>I'm gonna need a new poster.</i>

11:30.336 --> 11:32.106
Mom,
if I've learned anything

11:32.141 --> 11:34.004
From
my 17 non-winning campaigns,

11:34.039 --> 11:36.410
The poster can
only get you so far.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.564
It's really all about
the speech.

11:42.248 --> 11:43.861
You're supposed to give
a speech?

11:43.896 --> 11:46.522
Yeah, Thursday at 2:30.
3 to 5 minutes.

11:46.557 --> 11:49.144
- Have you written it yet?
- I don't know the words yet,

11:49.179 --> 11:50.950
But I do know
what shirt I'm gonna wear.

11:54.674 --> 11:57.512
- Hi. How'd your interview go?
- Great, really great.

11:57.547 --> 11:59.068
Can I see you
in the kitchen for a sec?

12:02.618 --> 12:03.770
it was awful.

12:03.805 --> 12:05.910
She kept asking me
all these stupid questions

12:05.945 --> 12:07.756
That had nothing to do
with the job.

12:07.791 --> 12:10.816
How do I describe myself?
I don't.

12:11.474 --> 12:13.800
It was just stupid.
It was stupid,

12:13.835 --> 12:15.102
And I told her so.

12:15.137 --> 12:18.188
Mike, you have to learn
to play the game.

12:18.223 --> 12:20.368
You gotta suck it up
in these things.

12:20.403 --> 12:22.300
Look, you have
another interview tomorrow,

12:22.335 --> 12:24.300
And whatever crap job
they're offering you,

12:24.335 --> 12:26.742
You have to make them think
it's your passion.

12:26.777 --> 12:29.676
My passion is you
and the colts and the kids.

12:29.711 --> 12:31.911
Work is... Work.

12:31.946 --> 12:33.694
You can't tell them that,
mike.

12:33.729 --> 12:35.850
And thank you for putting me
above the colts.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.590
I'm telling you,
it's tough out there, frankie.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.206
I don't know
how anybody gets a job.

12:39.207 --> 12:40.764
Hey, I got a job!

12:40.799 --> 12:42.156
The guy from the movie theater
texted me.

12:42.191 --> 12:45.474
I work in the projector, and he says
I can have girls up there..

12:48.928 --> 12:50.414
<i>So mike went
to his next interview</i>

12:50.449 --> 12:55.032
<i>- Ready to play the game.
- So, mike, what iit about septic tanks</i>

12:55.067 --> 12:57.146
That appeals to you?

12:57.614 --> 13:00.222
gosh.
Where do I begin?

13:00.257 --> 13:03.466
Uh, I think
what you do is important

13:03.501 --> 13:04.918
For the community.

13:04.953 --> 13:08.178
Well, there are a lot of
important jobs out there, mike.

13:08.688 --> 13:09.916
Why this one?

13:10.354 --> 13:13.786
I just really like to work
with my hands, you know?

13:13.821 --> 13:15.678
Just get in there
and...

13:18.846 --> 13:21.526
Lot of jobs where you can
work with your hands.

13:21.940 --> 13:23.446
Why here?

13:25.058 --> 13:26.600
I just...

13:26.635 --> 13:28.895
Think of the reward...

13:28.930 --> 13:31.076
Of hosing out a tank

13:31.111 --> 13:35.234
And giving some lucky family
a fresh new start.

13:35.269 --> 13:37.848
I mean, you can't ever
really get to know somebody

13:37.883 --> 13:40.234
Until you've gotten to know
their waste.

13:40.269 --> 13:42.872
<i>But why septic waste?</i>

13:43.908 --> 13:45.514
Because...

13:46.520 --> 13:50.528
The idea of putting on
a rubber suit and goggles

13:50.563 --> 13:52.598
And wading
through human excrement

13:52.633 --> 13:55.534
Sounds like the adventure
of a lifetime!

13:56.226 --> 13:59.216
It's like being an astronaut
here on planet earth.

13:59.251 --> 14:02.372
I guess what
I'm really saying is that...

14:02.373 --> 14:05.538
Seotic waste is my passion.

14:11.499 --> 14:13.502
Okay, so in your speech,
you have to say

14:13.537 --> 14:15.540
Why do you want
to be school historian? So...

14:15.541 --> 14:17.520
Write was to be school historian.

14:17.555 --> 14:19.565
Just write
whatever you want.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.117
Brick,
I won't always be here.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.539
You know, if you want something,
you have to work for it.

14:24.574 --> 14:27.003
It doesn't just
magically come to you.

14:27.038 --> 14:28.582
Here's the rest
of the posters,

14:28.617 --> 14:29.689
And I made
this "brick" flag,

14:29.724 --> 14:31.551
In case you want to wave it
around at the assembly.

14:31.586 --> 14:34.477
Careful, 'cause
the paint's still wet.

14:36.257 --> 14:38.507
brick, why are you reading?

14:38.542 --> 14:39.723
Bob's bringing your posters,

14:39.758 --> 14:41.597
I'm sitting here
doing your speech.

14:41.598 --> 14:43.359
well, I didn't ask you to.

14:43.394 --> 14:46.685
- Well, somebody has to.
- God! You're suffocating me!

14:46.720 --> 14:48.175
Hey, break it up!

14:48.210 --> 14:50.735
would you come
with me for a second?

14:52.552 --> 14:54.672
Look, frankie,
if he doesn't get it done,

14:54.707 --> 14:57.116
He doesn't get it done.
It's not your job to save him.

14:57.151 --> 14:58.429
bob,
you don't know what hapened.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.231
They already think
he's a nerd.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.505
All right. I'm gonna
let you in on a little secret.

15:05.217 --> 15:06.669
I was a nerd.

15:08.049 --> 15:11.454
- Blows your mind, right?
- Yeah.

15:11.489 --> 15:13.829
Best thing my folks ever did
was let me fail...

15:13.864 --> 15:16.615
Everything. They didn't even put
training wheels on my bike.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.345
Broke my wrist three times,
but I learned.

15:19.380 --> 15:22.195
Now every time I-I think
I can't do something,

15:22.230 --> 15:24.933
I just listen to the click
of my wrist.

15:25.119 --> 15:28.213
<i>Clearly bob had
terrible, terrible parents,</i>

15:28.248 --> 15:31.389
<i>But there was a grain of truth
to what he was saying.</i>

15:34.193 --> 15:37.155
Look, honey,
I'm sorry.

15:37.190 --> 15:40.717
It's your speech,
so write it, don't write it...

15:40.752 --> 15:41.815
It's up to you.

15:41.850 --> 15:44.565
Okay, I won't write it.
Thanks, mom.

15:50.970 --> 15:52.885
hi, honey.
How was the interview?

15:52.920 --> 15:54.019
It went great.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.499
Really? You don't need
to see me in the kitchen?

15:56.534 --> 15:59.751
Nope. Bob,
what are you doing here?

15:59.786 --> 16:01.785
Ohwe just, uh,
put the kids to bed...

16:01.786 --> 16:02.861
Yeah.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.617
Thought we'd watch
a little tv.

16:05.477 --> 16:06.903
Can I get you a beer?

16:06.938 --> 16:08.993
Uh, no, thanks, bob.
I got it.

16:10.429 --> 16:11.859
Those my pajama bottoms?

16:11.860 --> 16:13.757
Oh, yeah.
I got paint on my pants,

16:13.792 --> 16:16.407
So they're in the wash,
so I grabbed a pair of yours.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.291
I knew
you'd be okay with it.

16:19.723 --> 16:21.158
Get out, bob.

16:22.765 --> 16:24.815
You sure? 'cause, uh...

16:24.850 --> 16:27.272
maroon 5's
on "kimmel" tonight.

16:27.307 --> 16:29.329
I don't know who that is, bob.
Drive safe.

16:33.783 --> 16:36.982
So?
It really went well?

16:37.017 --> 16:38.691
killed my soul.

16:38.726 --> 16:40.979
That's how you know
you're doing it righ

16:45.207 --> 16:47.594
<i>So the day of the election
had arrived,</i>

16:47.629 --> 16:50.021
<i>And I was ready
to let brick sink or swim,</i>

16:50.056 --> 16:53.047
<i>But if he really started sinkg,
i was prepared to pull a fire alarm.</i>

16:53.048 --> 16:54.717
Has been an excelent history.

16:57.048 --> 16:58.538
orson septic.

16:59.694 --> 17:01.662
I believe serving
in student council

17:01.697 --> 17:04.064
Is the best way for me
to give back to the school

17:04.098 --> 17:06.828
That gives me so much.
I would be honored

17:06.863 --> 17:09.318
With the great privilege
to tell our story

17:09.353 --> 17:12.886
For future generations to come.
Since the end of last year,

17:12.921 --> 17:15.291
I've been working tirelessly
day and night...

17:15.327 --> 17:16.606
And you sucked it up

17:16.641 --> 17:20.439
And everything.
Did he say why?

17:20.473 --> 17:23.529
Why, yes, he did. He said
he didn't believe anyone

17:23.564 --> 17:25.914
Could be that passionate
about septic tanks.

17:25.949 --> 17:28.685
He sensed a certain falseness
in my enthusiasm.

17:30.285 --> 17:31.808
Thank you.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.503
Thank you, ken.

17:33.538 --> 17:34.725
Our final candidate

17:34.760 --> 17:37.469
For school historian
is brick heck. Brick?

17:39.521 --> 17:41.408
brick?

17:41.443 --> 17:45.845
- How's his speech?
- I don't know. I didn't write it.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.178
What?

17:49.107 --> 17:51.123
Hi. I'm brick heck,

17:51.158 --> 17:53.993
Or, as most of you know me,
"nerd."

17:56.098 --> 17:58.086
I've spent a lot of time
locked in lockers

17:58.121 --> 17:59.716
Here at orson elementary,

17:59.751 --> 18:02.735
And that's given me
a lot of time to... Think.

18:04.223 --> 18:07.887
You may think I'm odd,
and maybe I am.

18:07.922 --> 18:10.084
Sure, I'm the kid who makes
you late for recess

18:10.119 --> 18:11.584
Because we have to walk
in a group,

18:16.456 --> 18:19.357
Sure, I talk
in a scottish accent sometimes.

18:19.392 --> 18:22.593
don't knock it
'til you've tried it!

18:26.009 --> 18:27.476
but aren't I
exactly what you want

18:27.511 --> 18:29.046
For your school historian?

18:29.081 --> 18:31.950
Someone who has no
social connections whatsoever?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.942
<i>Someone who will take
pictures of you</i>

18:33.977 --> 18:37.086
Doing fun things I have
no desire to be a part of.

18:37.121 --> 18:39.619
but the main reason
you should vote for me

18:39.654 --> 18:42.496
Is because I suck
at basketball...

18:45.554 --> 18:48.928
<i>And if I'm not elected,
I will try out for the team.</i>

18:48.963 --> 18:51.953
Do you really want that
on your conscience?

18:51.988 --> 18:53.556
I don't think so.

18:58.272 --> 19:00.382
<i>I was so worried
about trying to save brick,</i>

19:00.417 --> 19:01.630
<i>But he saved us.</i>

19:01.665 --> 19:04.060
<i>He took a day that
could've been a real lousy one</i>

19:04.095 --> 19:06.030
<i>And turned it
into one of our best.</i>

19:06.065 --> 19:09.332
<i>like I said,
some days really surprise you.</i>

19:10.822 --> 19:12.178
I won!

19:12.213 --> 19:14.898
You're kidding?
Wow, brick!

19:14.933 --> 19:16.766
I'm so happy for you!

19:17.982 --> 19:20.159
Mom, could I see you
in the kitchen for a sec?

19:23.410 --> 19:24.880
I can't believe he won.

19:24.915 --> 19:27.014
I have tried out
for a million things,

19:27.049 --> 19:28.590
And I have never gotten
anything.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.726
It's just not fair.

19:29.727 --> 19:32.233
I know it seens that way now,

19:32.268 --> 19:35.038
But you we right there
on the back of his poster,

19:35.073 --> 19:36.908
Pushing him...

19:36.943 --> 19:38.716
From behind.

19:39.524 --> 19:41.843
Uh, so in a way,
it's your victory, too.

19:41.878 --> 19:43.774
Well, I'm just worried
about him.

19:43.809 --> 19:45.897
If he got the first thing
he ted out for,

19:45.932 --> 19:47.958
How is he ever gonna grow
as a person?

19:47.993 --> 19:50.693
Actually I feel sorry
for him.

19:50.728 --> 19:51.930
We all do, honey.

19:51.965 --> 19:54.209
How about
that brother of yours, huh?

19:54.244 --> 19:56.094
Nailed it
on his first try.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.606
God, I'm proud
of that kid.

19:57.641 --> 19:59.886
I haven't felt like this
since axl went to regionals.

19:59.921 --> 20:01.824
I have character.

20:03.601 --> 20:06.834
Hey, I made dinner.
Whatever.

20:06.869 --> 20:09.560
Okay, what's this about?
Did you get suspended?

20:09.595 --> 20:10.930
Did you crash your car?

20:10.965 --> 20:12.898
No, I got paid,
and I wanted to treat.

20:12.933 --> 20:14.328
God! You're welcome.

20:14.363 --> 20:15.904
Thanks, buddy.

20:15.939 --> 20:17.778
12,000 more dinners
and we're even.

20:22.672 --> 20:24.264
<i>So mike picked himself up</i>

20:24.299 --> 20:26.100
<i>And got right back
into the game.</i>

20:26.135 --> 20:27.392
Honey, have you seen wh...

20:27.427 --> 20:28.784
I'm on an interview.

20:31.153 --> 20:32.748
<i>Besides,
