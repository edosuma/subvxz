(SINGING)
It seems today that all you see

00:05.172 --> 00:07.925
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.258 --> 00:11.762
But where are those
Good old-fashioned values

00:11.845 --> 00:14.264
ALL: On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:17.893
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.310 --> 00:21.605
Lucky there's a man
Who positively can do

00:21.688 --> 00:23.106
All the things that make us

00:23.190 --> 00:24.691
Laugh and cry

00:24.942 --> 00:29.988
ALL: He's a family guy!

00:34.993 --> 00:36.203
Hey, where's Cleveland?

00:36.286 --> 00:38.330
Doesn't he have a relative
in town or something?

00:38.413 --> 00:40.874
I don't know, but I ordered him
a beer and now it's just sitting there

00:40.958 --> 00:43.377
looking lonelier than
Alan Rickman's answering machine.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.254

Hello, Alan Rickman.

It's Alan Rickman

01:02.062 --> 01:05.732
reminding you to move
the pork chops from the freezer

01:05.899 --> 01:09.319
to the refrigerator
so they defrost properly.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.822

01:29.631 --> 01:32.467
Remember that turtle joke for the party.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.761
(CHUCKLES)

01:35.429 --> 01:38.265
Hey, y'all. I want you to meet
my cousin from Jamaica...

01:38.348 --> 01:39.600
Madame Claude.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.976
(IN JAMAICAN ACCENT) Nice to meet you all.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.395
You sound like the crab
from Little Mermaid.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.314
I had crabs once. It was awful.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.691
You got to buy that cream
that comes with the little comb.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.735
Of course, I can still use the comb.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.945
Well, that's Quagmire.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.740
And you know what else?
Madame Claude is psychic.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.117
She can tell you what
you were in a past life.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.745
I already know what I was.
A strawberry.

02:00.078 --> 02:04.208
Ah, it's another pleasant day for me...
Peter the strawberry.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.751
Hey, Mr. Worm.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.213
I welcome your arrival,
'cause we're all part of the same garden.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.089
-(NOISY CHEWING)
-Wait, what are you...

02:11.173 --> 02:13.509
Wait, hey! (BLOWING AIR)
Hey get out of here!

02:13.675 --> 02:17.804
Hey, uh... (SCREAMING)

02:18.597 --> 02:22.434
(CRYING) He was my neighbor
and he violated me!

02:23.352 --> 02:26.063
Now I'll never end up in a fancy pie!

02:26.647 --> 02:29.191
What do you say, Joe,
you want your past life read?

02:29.274 --> 02:31.443
-It'll be fun.
-Sure, why not.

02:32.945 --> 02:36.156
Okay, dear, close your eyes
and clear your mind.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.076
Okay, I'm seeing something...

02:39.826 --> 02:42.329
Joe, you were an octopus.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.666
Yes! Yes! this is so awesome!

02:45.874 --> 02:47.334
Damn it!

02:47.918 --> 02:50.504
Oh, that's so cool, that's so cool.
Do me next.

02:51.255 --> 02:54.299
I'm getting something.
I see you in London.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.260
I think it's the 1800's.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.304
Oh, my, you were Jack the Ripper!

03:03.016 --> 03:04.518
(FOOTSTEPS)

03:05.894 --> 03:07.271
Giggity.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.481
-What about Peter?
-Yeah, Peter next.

03:09.565 --> 03:12.359
Oh, I don't think there's anything
in the black bag for me.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.695
You're wrong, Peter. Let us begin.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.408
Oh my, you were a very important man.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.451
You were Griffin Peterson.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.495
The founder of the city of Quahog.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.455
Now wait a second, Cool Runnings.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.708
We learned in school that
Miles "Chatterbox" Musket

03:27.791 --> 03:30.377
founded Quahog after
he was saved by the Magic Clam.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.462
No, that is a myth.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.757
Peter, you were the founder of Quahog.

03:36.216 --> 03:40.179
I see... I see England a long time ago.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.356
MADAME CLAUDE: It is a crisp,
clear spring morning,

03:51.607 --> 03:55.652
and Griffin Peterson is riding
to the home of his beloved.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.951
Peterson, what are you doing here?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.328
Shouldn't you be down at your job

04:04.411 --> 04:06.788
making oblong bricks
out of manure and straw?

04:06.872 --> 04:08.749
No, we're off. It's Martin Luther Day.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.251
-(CHUCKLES)
-Yes, that's a very smart joke.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.212
Isn't that right, comedy professors?

04:13.545 --> 04:15.797
-Ah. Well done.
-Indeed.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.550
-Now what do you want?
-I want to marry your daughter,

04:18.634 --> 04:20.385
and I'm here to ask for your blessing.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.888
What could you possibly have
to offer my daughter?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.681
Well, I'm one of the few
guys in this town

04:24.765 --> 04:27.184
who isn't dying a slow,
painful diarrhea death.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.311
All right, come on in.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.274
Knock, knock. Lady Redbush?

04:34.858 --> 04:37.361
Griffin! It's so good to see you.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.738
I'm so horny. Kiss my hand.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.865
What are you doing here?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.034
I was just walking off
the rotted goose anus

04:44.117 --> 04:45.911
I had for breakfast,
and I thought I'd come by

04:45.994 --> 04:47.412
and ask you a little question.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.705
What's that?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.582
-Will you marry me?
-(GASPS)

04:50.666 --> 04:54.002
Oh, my God, yes! Yes, I will, Griffin.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.046
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.841
-Did you do it?
-I did it.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.384
(CHEERING)

05:01.510 --> 05:03.595
MADAME CLAUDE:
But in another partof London,

05:03.929 --> 05:06.723
there was a man who was not
in such good spirits.

05:07.099 --> 05:10.018
The King of England... Stewart the T'ird.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.313
Oh, I'm so bored.
I wish to be entertained.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.565
Where's my troupe of actors?

05:14.940 --> 05:16.567
(PLAYING FANFARE)

05:17.067 --> 05:20.696
Presenting the cast
of How I Met Your Mother.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.407
You told her I told you I kissed her?

05:23.490 --> 05:25.158
Dude, you broke the bro code.

05:25.242 --> 05:28.620
-That's not against the bro code.
-Yes, it is. Article 15-B.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.330
That's the heart of the bro code, man.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.457
Well, you're right.
I guess I did break the bro code.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.710
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.629
What is this? Are these jokes?

05:37.880 --> 05:40.382
Do people in other castles
think this is funny?

05:40.465 --> 05:43.719
Well, yeah, we get a pretty sizable
chunk of princes, 18 to 34.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.929
I think I'd like to delete
this from my TiVo.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.765
Are you sure you want
to delete this program?

05:48.849 --> 05:49.850
Yes.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.644
Bring me my mid-season
replacement fool.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.272
-Hi there.
-I want to hear some jokes, fool.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.441
Well, you know, I don't really tell jokes.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.401
I like to tell stories from my life

05:59.484 --> 06:02.279
and let the humor just flow organically
from everyday situations.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.614
(CLEARING THROAT)

06:03.697 --> 06:05.991
Yeah, my Aunt Frida was a real card.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.951
She always had the most
wonderful spirit.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.953
Even when her mind started to go.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.331
I remember once she wrote
a letter to my Uncle Tom

06:12.414 --> 06:14.625
from whom she'd been
divorced for several years.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.461
And in the letter she
misspelled his name T-O-M-M.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.963
And I said, "Frida, you've spelled
Tom's name wrong.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.757
"You need to take out
one of the M's."

06:21.840 --> 06:23.425
And she said, "Which one?"

06:24.176 --> 06:26.178
You know, you're going to be
(BLEEP) dead in five seconds

06:26.261 --> 06:27.930
if Aunt Frida doesn't throw
a pie at somebody.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.015
I mean, part of that is you sort
of have to know my family...

06:30.098 --> 06:31.099
Make me laugh!

06:31.183 --> 06:32.726
Hey, look, keys.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.144
(LAUGHING)

06:34.228 --> 06:36.980
That's so satirical.
What social commentary.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.693
Well, now I'm in a wonderful humor.
I wish to go for a walk into town.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.950
Hey, coachman, let's drive
on the left side of the road

06:48.033 --> 06:49.326
and see if that catches on.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.788
Good Lord! Who is that?

06:56.166 --> 06:57.292
That's Lady Redbush

06:57.376 --> 06:59.503
and her husband-to-be, Griffin Peterson.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.173
That piece of ass is marrying
that tall glass of poop juice?

07:03.257 --> 07:05.425
Well, not if I have
anything to say about it.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.886
A woman of that caliber
should be married to a king.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.304
Well, what are you
going to do about him?

07:09.388 --> 07:11.056
I'm the king, jester.

07:11.265 --> 07:14.393
I'm going to have him exiled
to the farthest corner of the world.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.228
And then she'll be all mine.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.772
Why is he such a jerk to everybody?

07:18.856 --> 07:21.275
Because he has a very, very small penis.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.610
I've seen it actually, and it's like,

07:23.694 --> 07:25.153
you don't even want
to make fun of it, you know.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.406
It's just medically fascinating.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.782
I kind of want to see it.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.993
Yeah, it's like that
one grape in the bunch

07:31.118 --> 07:32.870
that never got to be a grape.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.122
(CHURCH BELL RINGING)

07:38.333 --> 07:40.169
I wonder what's keeping Griffin?

07:40.252 --> 07:42.004
Oh, I'm sure he'll be along, sweetie.

07:42.087 --> 07:45.007
Remember he's tubby.
It takes him a while to move around.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.384
I hope he didn't get diarrhea and die.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.635
Can I feel those boobs?

07:48.719 --> 07:50.470
No, Daddy! What, are you sick?

07:50.554 --> 07:52.222
Hey, it's a different time.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.100
What a wonderfully exciting day.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.935
I'm young, I'm all dressed up

07:57.019 --> 07:59.188
and I'm on my way to marry
the woman I love.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.107
And there's 290 years
separating me

08:02.274 --> 08:03.817
from the films of Kevin Smith.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.360
KING STEWART: Hey, Peterson.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.157
-Who are you?
-I'm King Stewart.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.950
Don't you recognize me from the coins?

08:12.451 --> 08:13.869
Oh, yeah, the ones with your profile.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.121
You know, you look
really weird from the side.

08:16.205 --> 08:19.249
Well, that's something we didn't really
think out too well when we started.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.252
But never mind that!
You're going into exile, Peterson.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.214
I'm shipping you out
on the first boat to the New World.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.882
But I'm supposed to get married today.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.634
Oh, yeah? Where you going
for your honeymoon?

08:28.717 --> 08:31.220
-That medium-sized hill.
-Wrong. Seize him.

08:33.472 --> 08:37.100
MADAME CLAUDE: And King Stewart's
crueltywas only just beginning.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.394
Maybe he changed his mind.

08:39.478 --> 08:40.854
Maybe he's not coming.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.564
Oh, come on, now.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.650
There, feel better after I just said that?

08:44.900 --> 08:46.610
-Give me one little touch.
-No!

08:46.944 --> 08:49.780
I hate this! I... I... I hate my life!

I didn't vote for him.

Your Majesty, this is a real honor.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.998
Carter Redbush. Very glad to meet you.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.917
(AS PAUL LYNDE) Hello. Harry McAfee.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.711
As a citizen, I'm proud
to have you reign over me

09:04.795 --> 09:06.672
and the McAfee Fertilizer Company.

09:08.006 --> 09:11.051
Lady Redbush, I wish
I was here on a happier errand,

09:11.134 --> 09:14.763
but I'm afraid I must inform you
that Griffin Peterson is dead.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.139
(GASPS) What?

09:16.765 --> 09:19.017
Now that some time has passed,
do you want to go out?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.275
MADAME CLAUDE: With Griffin Peterson
exiled to the New World

09:26.358 --> 09:28.360
and Lady Redbush
believing he was dead,

09:28.443 --> 09:31.113
King Stewart was now free to marry her.

09:31.363 --> 09:34.283
The bride and groom
have written their own vows.

09:34.867 --> 09:38.412
Our love is like two figs
hanging from a fig tree,

09:38.787 --> 09:40.789
cradled by Cupid's own hand.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.457
You and I are like...

09:43.584 --> 09:47.212
Oh, I'm sorry. Is my wedding
interrupting your promotion?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.507
We're right in the middle
of our show, okay?

09:50.591 --> 09:53.343
Right now.
You have a time slot. Go there.

09:54.178 --> 09:57.181
Maybe finish this candy bar
before you open another one.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.683
Well, at least it wasn't
one of those promos

09:59.766 --> 10:02.311
where they have the whole cast
shoving each other playfully

10:02.394 --> 10:03.979
like they're all good pals.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.898
Oh, look, there we go.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.525
Oh, look at them jostling
each other around.

10:08.859 --> 10:12.279
Oh, they give each other a hard time,
but they're friends.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.489
-Is that a real show?
-No, it's just...

10:14.573 --> 10:16.366
No, somebody's making a joke. Forget it.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.204
MADAME CLAUDE: Meanwhile,
Griffin Petersonand the other exiles

10:20.287 --> 10:22.831
pass the time on the ship
to the New World.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.125
Aw, crap, a splinter.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.668
Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.378
So what'd you do to get exiled?

10:28.462 --> 10:30.339
I got caught pleasuring myself

10:30.422 --> 10:33.592
to a painstakingly-etched
engraving of "The Wife of Bath."

10:33.675 --> 10:34.927
What'd you do?

10:35.010 --> 10:37.930
I slept with an underage virgin
to cure my puff penis.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.724
Hey, fellas, you want to join me
in a game of mumble peg?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.018
-Oh, no thanks.
-Fine. I'll play by myself.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.521
(MUMBLING)

10:46.980 --> 10:48.357
One-nothing.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.401
MADAME CLAUDE: Eventually,
aftermany months at sea,

10:51.568 --> 10:55.572
Griffin Peterson and his shipmates
finally reached the New World.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.659
I declare this land Quahog.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.620
This place is nothing but a wilderness.
What are we going to do?

11:01.703 --> 11:03.664
We're going to build a new settlement.

11:03.914 --> 11:07.251
We'll have a happy new life
and we'll have equal rights for all.

11:07.668 --> 11:11.380
Except blacks, Asians, Hispanics,
Jews, gays, women, Muslims...

11:11.630 --> 11:13.549
Um, everybody who's not a white man.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.468
And I mean, white-white,
so no Italians, no Polish...

11:16.677 --> 11:18.887
Just people from Ireland,
England, and Scotland.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.515
But only certain parts
of Scotland and Ireland.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.100
Just full-blooded whites.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.311
No, you know what? Not even whites.
Nobody gets any rights.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.772
Ah, America.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.738
How's your stewed fox quail, my dear?

11:36.822 --> 11:40.033
Oh, it's quite good.
I'm also enjoying the turtled hen.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.368
Isn't the turtled hen good?

11:42.119 --> 11:44.580
So, listen. You and I need
to have a conversation

11:44.663 --> 11:46.415
about you not bearing me a son.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.250
Well, my lord, we've discussed this.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.919
We have to have sex in order
for me to bear you a son.

11:51.003 --> 11:54.464
Oh, I know. I've just been so tired
and I've had so much work,

11:54.548 --> 11:57.968
and I think I wanted to the other day,
but I couldn't find you, so...

11:58.051 --> 12:00.679
You know, it's like both of us
and our schedules, you know?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.556
Well, why don't we do it tonight?

12:02.806 --> 12:05.517
Maybe. Tonight might work. Yeah...

12:05.601 --> 12:07.477
Oh, no! I got that thing in the morning.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.396
Oh, how about tomorrow at 4:00?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.565
You know I'm with my mother
tomorrow at 4:00.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.985
Oh, darn it. I'm going to be
so horny tomorrow at 4:00.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.945
You know, I got to say,
I'm a little mad at you

12:17.029 --> 12:18.405
for not being more available.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.532
Well, we can have sex
right now on the table.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.201
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.869
We eat here.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.542
MADAME CLAUDE: Griffin Peterson
and the othercolonists

12:30.626 --> 12:32.044
worked day and night

12:32.127 --> 12:36.256
to build their new settlement
until finally, after much hard work,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.884
the colony of Quahog was complete.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.103
It didn't take long before Quahog

12:50.187 --> 12:53.690
was a thriving New World settlement,
bustling with life.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.443
Boy, everything's shaping up real nice.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.904
Yeah, and we finally finished
the town abortion clinic.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.788
MADAME CLAUDE: Time had helped
Griffinforget Lady Redbush

13:07.955 --> 13:10.749
and soon he found himself
a hearty new wife.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.501
Boy, that was fantastic.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.211
You must have had a lot of practice.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.381
No, not really.
I've been saving myself for marriage.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.049
(SIGHS)

13:19.132 --> 13:20.884
We should probably
open up some windows.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.306
I don't know what to do, Jester.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.475
I can't be married to the king anymore.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.270
My heart still belongs
to Griffin Peterson.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.355
-But he's dead.
-(SIGHS)

13:33.814 --> 13:35.816
-No, he's not.
-What?

13:36.024 --> 13:39.653
I was ordered to keep silent by the king
under threat of execution,

13:39.778 --> 13:41.405
but you're going to see this anyway.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.370
(GASPS) Oh, my God!

13:48.829 --> 13:51.874
He's alive!
Jester, I've got to get to him.

13:51.957 --> 13:54.001
I'll help you,
but only if I can go with you.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.670
If I stay here, the king will execute me
for telling you all this.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.881
Well, okay,
but how are we going to get there?

13:58.964 --> 14:01.592
We'll hitch a ride on one
of the slave ships tomorrow night.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.427
After an all new Shovin' Buddies.

14:06.305 --> 14:09.516
Followed by an all new
Slowly Rotating Black Man.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.190
MADAME CLAUDE: And so,
Lady Redbush sailed off

14:16.273 --> 14:18.567
to the New World to find her beloved.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.279
And the timing was good because
his new wifewas a pain in him ass.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.031
And then I finished scrubbing the kettle,

14:24.114 --> 14:27.409
but then I saw that I'd missed
a spot and, oh, I was so worried

14:27.492 --> 14:29.703
that the whole thing wasn't
clean enough, so I went back

14:29.786 --> 14:31.663
and started washing it again
and sure enough,

14:31.997 --> 14:33.248
I'd missed another spot.

14:33.332 --> 14:34.958
And there was a clump
of cornmeal under the rim

14:35.042 --> 14:38.045
-from when I made breakfast.
-Shut up, Meg! I prithee, shut up!

14:38.253 --> 14:39.421
Griffin!

14:39.546 --> 14:41.131
Lady Redbush.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.929
MADAME CLAUDE: And so,
Griffin Petersonand Lady Redbush

14:47.012 --> 14:48.472
were happily reunited.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.682
Of course, Griffin had to go through

14:50.766 --> 14:53.602
the complex, extensive
divorce procedure

14:53.685 --> 14:55.979
required by 18th century society.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.945
Gone? What do you mean, she's gone?

15:03.028 --> 15:06.156
Sire, Lady Redbush has been
gone these six months.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.075
-Six months?
-Yes.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.786
Forgive me, sire, but how
could you not be aware of this?

15:10.869 --> 15:12.829
Don't you share a bedchamber with her?

15:12.913 --> 15:14.957
Well, I mean, sometimes.
I mean, we sleep...

15:15.040 --> 15:16.375
We... We... We go to different...

15:16.458 --> 15:18.252
Uh, we got to bed at different times.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.504
We've both been so busy.
It's been ridiculous.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.631
I thought she was taking
a class or something.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.801
Oh, man, that sucks
because I'm so horny!

15:25.884 --> 15:29.012
Damn it! Oh, I wanted
to do sex to her tonight.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.848
Well, then, I guess
we've got to go get her.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.516
Yeah, all right.

15:34.768 --> 15:38.480
MADAME CLAUDE: Months rolled by
and Griffin and Lady Redbush

15:38.564 --> 15:41.567
continued to flourish happily
in the colony of Quahog,

15:41.859 --> 15:45.946
completely unaware that
King Stewart was on the march.

15:46.363 --> 15:49.867
(SINGING)
There was a peaceful town called Quahog

15:51.118 --> 15:54.580
Where people lived in harmony

15:55.747 --> 15:59.543
They never had no kind of trouble

16:00.752 --> 16:04.006
There was no hint of misery

16:09.136 --> 16:10.846
Then all at once the trouble started

16:12.431 --> 16:14.391
A pack of murderers and thieves

16:15.475 --> 16:17.352
Like swarms of locusts they descended

16:18.228 --> 16:20.814
Their aim to make the town folk flee

16:23.650 --> 16:24.902
They've got to be here somewhere.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.528
Where's my first lieutenant?

16:26.612 --> 16:28.280
Here I am, sir. Yes, sir. Right, indeed.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.199
Here, indeed. Yes, I am, sir.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.576
I want you to turn this
settlement upside down

16:32.659 --> 16:34.703
until you find Lady Redbush
and Griffin Peterson.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.121
That fat bastard thinks

16:36.205 --> 16:37.956
he can steal my bride
and get away with it?

16:38.040 --> 16:40.542
I wouldn't bet a corn
farthing on him escaping.

16:40.626 --> 16:43.420
No, I wouldn't. Not a corn
farthing would I bet. No, sir.

16:43.545 --> 16:44.588
What's wrong with you?

16:44.671 --> 16:48.217
Little wrong in the head, I am,
from eating some bad sausages.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.552
Yes, sir, bad sausages did I eat,
indeed, sir.

16:50.636 --> 16:53.096
Yes, I did. Some bad sausages, ate I.

16:56.850 --> 17:00.479
Oh, Griffin, this time together
has been the happiest of my life.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.980
Me, too, Lady Redbush.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.857
All those months I was without you,

17:03.941 --> 17:06.860
I never stopped seeing your face
in the back of my wife's head.

17:06.944 --> 17:09.863
And all those months
I was sailing for the New World,

17:09.947 --> 17:12.491
I saw your face in
every slave's stomach.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.243
Tell me we'll be together forever.

17:14.326 --> 17:15.494
We will.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.120
(BOTH GASP)

17:17.204 --> 17:19.164
I found 'em, Your Majesty.
Indeed, yes I did.

17:19.248 --> 17:21.416
Found 'em did I.
Indeed, yes, sir, I did.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.502
Yeah, okay, okay, whatever.
All right, Peterson,

17:23.585 --> 17:25.295
two things are gonna happen here.

17:25.379 --> 17:27.756
I'm gonna take my wife back
and then I'm gonna kill you.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.258
All right, all right, Mr. King, sir.

17:29.341 --> 17:32.970
You win. I'm sorry, Lady Redbush,
but he is your husband.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.807
Let me just, uh, walk over here
and get your things for you.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.351
Nyah-ha! All right, Your Majesty.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.353
If you want to leave with
your pal in one piece,

17:41.436 --> 17:42.938
I suggest you throw
down your weapons.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.606
-Aah!
-Go ahead and kill him, Griffin.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.149
You kill him and I'll kill her.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.943
Go ahead. You kill her, I'll kill him.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.319
Go ahead. You kill him, I'll kill her.

You kill her, I'll kill him.

You kill him, I'll kill her.

(LAUGHS) This is me before
Ultra Slim-Fast.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.785
You kill her, I'll kill him.

17:56.869 --> 17:59.454
Wait, wait! There's got to be
a better way to settle this.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.624
-Talent show?
-Talent show.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.172
Hear ye, hear ye.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.716
This talent competition will
decide rightful possession

18:10.799 --> 18:14.219
of the good Lady Redbush and
control of the Colony of Quahog.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.388
We first present King Stewart of England

18:16.471 --> 18:18.265
with some observational humor.

18:18.348 --> 18:19.558
Hi, there, everybody.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.186
You know,
my Aunt Frida was a real card.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.979
She always had the most
wonderful spirit...

18:24.313 --> 18:25.939
Even when her mind started to go.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.232
What the (BLEEP)

18:27.316 --> 18:29.526
I remember once she wrote
a letter to my Uncle Tom

18:29.610 --> 18:31.737
from whom she'd been
divorced for several years.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.698
And in the letter,
she misspelled his name T-O-M-M.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.034
This is my bit.
These are all my bits.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.203
-Shh. This is funny.
-Unbelievable.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.371
And I said,
"Frida, you've spelled Tom's name wrong.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.831
"You need to take out one of the M's."

18:42.915 --> 18:44.791
And she said, "Which one?"

18:44.875 --> 18:46.251

lived in peace and happiness.

Oh, Griffin, I love you.

And I want to be there when
you die giving birth to it.

of Griffin Peterson

20:39.615 --> 20:41.408
and the founding of Quahog.
