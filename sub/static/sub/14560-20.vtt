WEBVTT

00:14.448 --> 00:17.551
How did Larry escape
this moving day?

00:17.585 --> 00:20.121
He's at an astrophysics
conference at Berkeley.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.390
Oh, why didn't
I think of that.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.558
My first day
at Cal Sci

00:24.592 --> 00:26.127
I stood in this office
and Biederman

00:26.160 --> 00:27.328
sat right there
and he gave me

00:27.361 --> 00:29.463
the once-over
and he asked,

00:29.497 --> 00:33.567
"Are you the boy-genius
that everyone says you are?"

00:33.601 --> 00:36.137
Well, now Biederman's retired,
and you are the man.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.406
Oh, pardon me,
I mean man-genius.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.208
You know, before Biederman,
Newberry sat here.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.575
And before him
it was Knox

00:41.609 --> 00:43.777
and Hightower.

00:43.811 --> 00:44.978
All those guys broke new ground
in our field.

00:45.012 --> 00:48.116
It's like a torch being passed
from all the great minds.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.450
Well, maybe
those great minds

00:49.483 --> 00:52.186
will rub off on you
just by, uh, sitting there.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.228
Hey, that-that's it.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.363
You know, I've been dancing
around the idea

01:02.396 --> 01:04.432
of neural networks
for quite some time,

01:04.465 --> 01:06.134
and maybe
the whole time

01:06.167 --> 01:07.368
the answer I've been looking for

01:07.401 --> 01:09.103
has been right here
in front of me--

01:09.137 --> 01:11.105
a historical neural network.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.240
Think about it.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.208
There's hundreds of brilliant
people here at Cal Sci.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.709
What makes one academic,

01:15.743 --> 01:17.545
or one group of academics,

01:17.578 --> 01:18.879
generate revolutionary
advancements

01:18.912 --> 01:21.149
while others just...
just fizzle?

01:21.182 --> 01:23.217
I got to get this down.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.218
I'm sorry.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.753
Do you mind bringing in
the rest of the stuff?

01:25.786 --> 01:28.556
I don't want
to lose the flow.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.524
No, no, no,
oh, sure, sure.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.261
ALAN (clears throat):
He gets a breakthrough

01:33.294 --> 01:35.296
and we've got to bring in
40 more boxes.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.231
Okay.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.562
*

02:13.267 --> 02:14.402
(knocking)

02:14.435 --> 02:15.403
ALAN:
Charlie,

02:15.436 --> 02:17.371
you up all night?

02:17.405 --> 02:19.640
I, uh... lost track.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.209
I've been working.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.177
I'm actually on the verge
of a breakthrough. Hi.

02:23.211 --> 02:26.347
NIKKI: Hey, yeah, Charlie,
that's great,

02:26.380 --> 02:27.815
but we've been trying
to reach you all morning.

02:27.848 --> 02:28.816
I turned my
cell phone off.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.218
I'm sorry.
I-I forgot.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.385
You also forgot
the math

02:31.419 --> 02:32.920
you're supposed to
be doing for Don?

02:32.953 --> 02:35.456
The home invasion case.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.324
Home invasions?

02:36.357 --> 02:38.726
LAPD brought us
onto their task force.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.361
The same crew's
hit seven houses

02:40.394 --> 02:42.463
in seven days.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.498
Right. They want me
to generate a model.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.300
Profile some suspects--
their MO's.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.668
Including their habit

02:47.701 --> 02:49.670
of making false 911 calls.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.171
So, what you got?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.208
Um...

02:54.242 --> 02:55.376
You haven't even started yet?

02:55.409 --> 02:56.910
Well, no... No.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.847
In terms of analyzing
their MO's,

02:59.880 --> 03:01.282
I'll put together
a payoff matrix

03:01.315 --> 03:02.683
and that should do the trick.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.485
And the 911 calls?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.754
I can use Voronoi tessellations
to study the call patterns.

03:06.787 --> 03:07.888
And should be able

03:07.921 --> 03:10.624
to put together a program that
will give us a hot zone.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.826
I can also run
an analysis

03:12.860 --> 03:14.061
to profile the invaders,

03:14.094 --> 03:16.497
which will also tell us how many
invaders we're looking for.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.899
All right.
How soon can you be ready?

03:18.932 --> 03:20.501
I, uh...

03:20.534 --> 03:22.736
I guess I'll get to work on it
right now.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.443
MAN (on phone):
Three shots.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.611
You got to send someone please.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.779
WOMAN:
What's the address?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.947
MAN:
15462 Goldenrod Street.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.383
It's a white house.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.285
My neighbor's car
is parked in the driveway.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.886
A green Camry.
I know he's home.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.288
WOMAN:
Did you see anyone?

03:40.321 --> 03:41.389
Hot zone's getting smaller.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.657
MAN: By the time I got to my
window, they were gone.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.593
You got to hand it
to your brother.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.728
He came up with this math
pretty damn fast.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.398
Yeah, after screwing around
for two days.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.701
His model says that
we're looking for four guys.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.704
Smash and grab,
says maybe kids.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.640
So we've got our math
and we got our eyes in the area.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.409
Like my boy Tom Petty says,

04:01.442 --> 04:03.311
"The waiting is
the hardest part."

04:03.344 --> 04:05.313
Hm, Petty, huh?

04:05.346 --> 04:08.949
Yeah, Petty and Neil Young,
Springsteen.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.453
Oh, what, you pegged me
for Beyonce and Jay-Z?

04:12.486 --> 04:14.788
I wouldn't even begin
to try to peg you.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.425
David, this happens,

04:17.458 --> 04:18.692
you take point.

04:18.726 --> 04:19.760
Roger that.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.397
Wow, so the boss is giving
his new relief commander

04:23.431 --> 04:25.733
a few hours in the
pilot's seat, huh?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.768
You have flown before, right?

04:27.801 --> 04:31.839
Yes, with the same
lousy navigator.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.941
Well, the motor pool's
definitely not giving you

04:33.974 --> 04:35.075
any props for your bump.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.944
Got us in Grandma's
Crown Vic.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.680
Thought they retired these
things, like, a year ago.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.014
(groans)

04:41.048 --> 04:44.352
I don't want to when
they retired this thing.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.887
(phone ringing)

04:46.920 --> 04:48.422
Yeah, Bentancourt.

04:48.456 --> 04:51.692
Yeah, you got
a location?

04:51.725 --> 04:52.993
(keyboard clicking)

04:54.728 --> 04:55.496
All right, thanks.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.498
Aerial unit spotted
a gray van.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.032
Four guys entering a house.

04:59.066 --> 04:59.900
Sounds right.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.502
Hey, Colby, I'm sending
you an address.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.437
Copy that.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.407
All right, let's roll.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.376
(engine starts)

05:16.450 --> 05:17.785
All right,
what do you say, boss?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.887
You guys cover the back.
We'll take the front.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.904
(muffled scream):
No! No!

05:36.937 --> 05:37.938
FBI, FBI. Relax.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.610
(rustling)

05:42.643 --> 05:44.445
- Hey, you okay?
- (whimpers): Yes.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.245
Where are they?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.415
Out in the back--
the guesthouse.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.416
They've got my husband.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.551
FBI. Put your hands up slowly.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.420
Turn around.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.521
Gun!

05:54.788 --> 05:56.490
All right, come
here, come here.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.925
Stay in here.
Lock the door.

05:57.958 --> 05:58.959
Don't let anyone in.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.596
(automatic weapon firing)

06:27.488 --> 06:29.490
DON:
Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.793
(tires squealing)

06:34.628 --> 06:35.896
David, Colby, coming your way!

06:51.244 --> 06:52.179
(tires screeching)

06:55.716 --> 06:57.918
(tires squealing)

07:02.155 --> 07:03.491
You all right?

07:03.524 --> 07:04.492
Yeah, yeah.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.659
This is Sinclair.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.595
We have a gray van heading north
on Citrus.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.996
Need all available units.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.533
That's one way to retire a car.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.767
How is he?

07:13.801 --> 07:14.635
He's unconscious but alive.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.837
- I'll call it in.
- Uzis, Kevlar...

07:16.870 --> 07:18.972
These guys weren't
messing around.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.475
This is Eppes...

07:21.509 --> 07:22.576
(knife impacts, Don grunts)

07:40.160 --> 07:41.261
Hey, where is he?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.262
DAVID:
He's in the O.R., okay?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.997
The doctors took him to surgery
ten minutes ago.

07:44.031 --> 07:44.865
What happened?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.867
The bad guys had
some serious firepower,

07:46.900 --> 07:48.769
and we were outgunned.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.037
What about Don?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.705
There's a fifth man.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.240
He was hiding
in the guesthouse,

07:53.273 --> 07:54.908
and, uh, he surprised us.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.944
Hey. We just
heard the news.

07:56.977 --> 07:57.945
Are you all right?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.213
Yeah. A few stitches.
I still know my name.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.184
I was there-- I was supposed
to have his back.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.519
No, no,

08:05.553 --> 08:06.820
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.589
He's right, it's not...
it's not your fault.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.990
I predicted four invaders.
(phone rings)

08:10.023 --> 08:11.859
I didn't account
for a fifth man.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.527
Yeah. Sinclair.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.930
Fine. Get it to the lab, and
we'll take it from there, okay?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.866
All right, SID pulled
a partial print

08:18.899 --> 08:20.701
from a door handle
at the scene,

08:20.734 --> 08:21.669
but it's smudged.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.037
Could take a couple of days
to get results.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.973
Now, Charlie, I know you've
helped us

08:26.006 --> 08:27.207
with this kind of thing before.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.710
Yeah, using
a wavelet-based algorithm.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.645
Yeah, no, I want
to help you guys,

08:31.679 --> 08:33.781
- but my place is here.
- No, no, your place

08:33.814 --> 08:35.282
is where you're needed,
all of you.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.818
Just find these guys--
that's what Don would want.

08:37.851 --> 08:38.986
I'll call you when there's news.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.689
AMITA: Come on,
Charlie, let's go.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.959
(siren wailing)

08:45.993 --> 08:49.930
I-I didn't see their faces;
I didn't see much of anything.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.032
Okay, what about you,
Mrs. Fisher?

08:52.065 --> 08:53.667
They were on us before
we could even turn around.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.803
Well, did you hear anything?

08:55.836 --> 08:58.038
Maybe they called
each other by name,

08:58.071 --> 09:00.908
or... one of them had an accent.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.076
- I don't remember.
- Well, think harder--

09:03.110 --> 09:05.913
maybe you recognized a
voice-- a delivery man,

09:05.946 --> 09:07.781
someone who's done work
on your house.

09:07.815 --> 09:08.882
Um, I'm sorry.

09:14.154 --> 09:18.091
We'll have someone
come and get your statements.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.965
AMITA: We need to adjust
the parameters.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.567
At this rate, this
is gonna take days.

09:29.970 --> 09:33.040
I don't understand where
my predictive model went wrong.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.808
Th-This is where
my head was,

09:34.842 --> 09:37.110
instead of where
it was supposed to be.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.013
If I'd have committed more,
if I had spent more time...

09:40.047 --> 09:42.015
Well, you had the data you had.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.984
Yeah, and I let it
rule me.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.085
All I saw were
a bunch of kids

09:45.118 --> 09:46.119
pulling smash and grabs.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.387
Because I crunch numbers

09:47.420 --> 09:49.056
instead of looking
for the underlying truth.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.991
Look, Charlie...

09:51.024 --> 09:54.127
I can't begin
to imagine

09:54.161 --> 09:55.696
what you're going
through right now.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.799
But we need to focus
on what we can do now.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.669
Okay? If we can reconstruct
this print, then we can find

10:01.702 --> 10:03.136
the guy that attacked Don.

10:03.170 --> 10:06.139
Charlie, I can't
do this alone.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.177
(siren wailing)

10:18.919 --> 10:21.088
- How is he?
- He's, uh, he's in surgery.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.657
It's been, uh...

10:23.691 --> 10:25.258
five hours.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.795
I was in Portland.
I was at a conference.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.162
I got here, I'm sorry,

10:29.196 --> 10:31.098
I got here as fast as...

10:42.142 --> 10:44.111
Recovered the
getaway van.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.279
Stolen from a used car lot
two days ago.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.215
Bad guys wiped it down
and torched it.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.817
Man, this
doesn't add up.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.686
I mean, these guys break
into houses like pros,

10:52.720 --> 10:54.654
armed to the teeth,
leaving no witnesses?

10:59.727 --> 11:03.997
All they take is cash
and jewelry.

11:04.031 --> 11:07.100
Leave behind TVs, computers,
high-end electronics.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.736
Hard to blame Charlie

11:08.769 --> 11:10.037
for coming up
with the wrong profile.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.972
Well, there's plenty
of blame to go around.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.715
Four years in the LAPD,

11:21.749 --> 11:23.416
you telling me you never
got tagged before?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.418
Yeah, a few
times, sure.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.320
But I never
left my partner hanging.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.323
You go through enough doors,
the odds catch up with you.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.095
Don taught me that.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.735
When Don and I were dating...

11:41.769 --> 11:44.071
I was always afraid
he was gonna get hurt.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.139
He'd be too busy
worrying about me

11:46.173 --> 11:48.075
instead of himself.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.014
Things never go the way
we think they will,

11:54.047 --> 11:55.949
do they?

12:06.259 --> 12:09.229
CHARLIE:
Hey.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.030
So the wavelet analysis
came through.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.165
We reconstructed
the partial print.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.433
DAVID:
All right, did you run a search?

12:13.466 --> 12:15.335
The crime
databases failed

12:15.368 --> 12:18.772
to produce a result, so-so
we widened the scope.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.275
L.A. Unified School District.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.476
CHARLIE: Yeah, all teachers have
to be fingerprinted.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.246
DAVID:
Tom Kardum, 31.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.248
C... Chemistry teacher.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.184
2007 Teacher of the Year.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.886
Mayor's Heroes Award

12:32.920 --> 12:34.788
for his work with, uh,
underprivileged children.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.057
I mean, this guy doesn't
even have a parking ticket.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.425
Are you sure about the math,
Charlie?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.827
Uh, yeah.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.128
Amita and I tweaked
the parameters.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.997
I don't think we nudged it
too hard.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.532
Then again,

12:45.565 --> 12:47.134
I'm not having
the greatest week.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.003
Well, it can't hurt
to talk to the guy, right?

12:50.037 --> 12:51.271
(cell phone ringing)

12:51.304 --> 12:53.206
Oh, this is my dad.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.109
Hey.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.477
Okay, I'll be
right there.

12:57.510 --> 13:01.148
Um, Don's out of surgery.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.284
Look, you got
the wrong guy.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.086
I don't break
into houses.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.221
And the only gun I've ever
handled was on my Wii.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.023
How do you explain
the fingerprint?

13:10.057 --> 13:11.258
I can't.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.226
Though the work I do
with at-risk kids

13:13.260 --> 13:14.928
has taught me a
couple of things:

13:14.962 --> 13:16.296
cops, they
make mistakes,

13:16.329 --> 13:18.331
and those crime labs
aren't like the ones

13:18.365 --> 13:19.532
you see on those
dopey TV shows.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.034
You have anybody
that can

13:21.068 --> 13:22.836
vouch for your whereabouts
last night?

13:22.870 --> 13:25.472
Yeah, I had a game in Westwood,
finished up around 10:00.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.874
After that, I went to

13:26.907 --> 13:28.208
my girlfriend's house
in Cheviot Hills.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.877
You know, um,

13:29.910 --> 13:32.312
here's her number.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.482
You can talk to her yourself.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.217
Hey, thanks for your time.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.551
No worries.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.552
Hey, Tom,

13:39.586 --> 13:41.288
you, uh, you take
the freeway

13:41.321 --> 13:42.189
to see your girlfriend?

13:42.222 --> 13:43.223
Yeah.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.058
Cheviot Hills.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.126
That's the Robertson exit,
right?

13:47.294 --> 13:48.261
Uh, no, National.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.596
(chuckles)

13:49.629 --> 13:51.198
You know, the freeway was closed

13:51.231 --> 13:53.133
at the National exit last night.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.937
Someone made a phony 911 call.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.599
*

14:30.603 --> 14:33.306
Your son's a lucky man,
Mr. Eppes.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.342
The knife nicked
the pulmonary artery

14:35.375 --> 14:38.145
and collapsed a lung, but we
were able to get to him in time.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.546
How is he now?

14:39.579 --> 14:41.514
We repaired the arterial damage
with a synthetic graft,

14:41.548 --> 14:44.017
and we re-expanded
the lung.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.919
He's not out of the woods yet,
but I'm encouraged.

14:45.953 --> 14:49.056
(alarm beeping)

14:49.089 --> 14:50.623
I'm sorry.
You'll have to excuse me.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.259
- What's going on?
- Call a code blue!

14:52.292 --> 14:53.360
Get the crash cart!

14:53.393 --> 14:55.395
ALAN:
What's happening?

14:55.428 --> 14:57.397
DOCTOR:
Prepare the paddles.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.398
- What's his rhythm?
- V tach.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.100
Yeah, I'm paging him now.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.301
Start CPR.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.269
(alarm beeping)

15:02.302 --> 15:03.570
Charge to 360.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.705
- Charging to 360.
- Clear!

15:05.738 --> 15:07.440
Clear.
Clear.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.376
(alarm beeping)

15:09.409 --> 15:10.643
(flatline)

15:10.677 --> 15:11.578
Asystole.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.313
Open the line.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.416
Push an amp of epi
and an amp of atropine.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.185
Line's open.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.020
Pushing atropine.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.597
Please, just tell me he's okay.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.233
DOCTOR:
That knife did a lot of damage.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.468
Your son went into arrest
due to trauma--

15:35.502 --> 15:38.038
not just from his wounds,
but also the surgery.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.340
We were able
to bring him back.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.574
We're putting him
on anti-arrhythmia meds,

15:41.608 --> 15:43.210
but we'll need to keep
a close eye on him.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.212
What aren't you telling us?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.314
I expect a full recovery,

15:47.347 --> 15:50.450
but I can't guarantee that there
won't be another major event.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.252
The next 24 hours
will be critical.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.540
Alan called.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.076
Don is okay.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.710
Uh, at least for now.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.646
I mean...

16:21.748 --> 16:23.416
What do we have on Kardum?

16:23.450 --> 16:25.318
Guy's got another reason to run.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.155
Two weeks ago, Missing Persons

16:28.188 --> 16:29.556
interviewed him
about the disappearance

16:29.589 --> 16:31.258
of a Westside
financial adviser.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.225
Dennis Alessi?

16:32.259 --> 16:34.361
A witness saw
the two of them

16:34.394 --> 16:36.129
in a bar,
they left together.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.431
An hour later,
security cameras

16:38.465 --> 16:41.534
at Alessi's office building
show them going in.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.470
All right.
Kardum told police

16:43.503 --> 16:47.274
he was there to get
an investment prospectus.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.710
Checked the victims' names
against Alessi's client list,

16:50.743 --> 16:52.645
all eight of the names
are on here.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.551
All right, so, uh,
what are we thinking?

16:58.585 --> 16:59.619
Alessi is
bragging about

16:59.652 --> 17:01.554
his rich clients over drinks

17:01.588 --> 17:02.789
and Kardum sees an opportunity?

17:02.822 --> 17:04.224
NIKKI:
I still don't get how

17:04.257 --> 17:05.692
our teacher of the year
suddenly turns into

17:05.725 --> 17:06.626
a ten most wanted poster.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.263
No? Well, greed works for me.

17:17.404 --> 17:20.073
COLBY:
So, we searched your place.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.808
We found an automatic weapon.
(handcuffs clicking)

17:21.841 --> 17:24.244
We found Kevlar.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.478
We found bloodstains

17:25.512 --> 17:26.646
on a pair of shoes.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.182
Now, the question is,

17:29.216 --> 17:30.650
is that gonna match

17:30.683 --> 17:34.621
Agent Eppes or
Dennis Alessi?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.123
We know about Alessi.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.591
We know that you've been
targeting his clients.

17:40.693 --> 17:41.661
Tough guy.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.863
Just wait until we ID
the rest of your crew.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.133
This is your chance

17:46.166 --> 17:49.636
to give them up
before they give you up.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.239
An FBI agent

17:52.272 --> 17:54.141
is in the hospital; he may die.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.309
I had nothing to do with that.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.211
Yeah, that's right.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.812
You were too busy playing
with your Wii, weren't you?

18:02.149 --> 18:05.185
I want a lawyer.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.526
You actually might
need a doctor.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.728
'Cause there's
things that I can

18:15.762 --> 18:17.797
do to you,
won't even leave a mark.

18:17.830 --> 18:18.765
Let him go.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.133
Yeah.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.135
You're gonna need
meds just to get up

18:22.169 --> 18:23.770
and get out of bed in the
morning, you got that?!

18:23.803 --> 18:25.738
I said let him go.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.475
Granger!

18:28.508 --> 18:29.742
Take a walk.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.701
You know, you might want
to give me a heads up next time

18:54.734 --> 18:57.770
before you go
changing the playbook.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.207
Don's in a hospital,
breathing through a tube,

19:00.240 --> 19:01.774
because these guys
put him there.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.810
And we are gonna get them.
Not like this.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.445
We've done this before, David.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.780
I wasn't the boss before.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.317
Well, I can think of plenty of
times where we ran hard at a guy

19:10.350 --> 19:12.385
and Don just
looked the other way.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.424
I'm not Don.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.727
All right?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.662
I'm not him.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.243
(respirator pulsing
rhythmically)

19:38.778 --> 19:42.649
You know, it's not like I
didn't know this could happen.

19:42.682 --> 19:46.286
I just... didn't think
it would happen to Don.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.757
You know, he was born
in this hospital.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.661
Yeah, he was a handful
even then.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.895
Long labor,

19:55.928 --> 19:58.565
difficult delivery.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.300
You think he's
stubborn now?

20:00.333 --> 20:01.801
(laughs softly)

20:01.834 --> 20:04.904
I remember when my wife
was in recovery.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.840
They gave me him to... to hold.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.411
And, um, I hadn't been
around kids much,

20:11.444 --> 20:12.912
so I didn't know what to do.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.881
I... couldn't even
remember any lullabies.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.818
So for hours,
I sang Sgt. Pepper to him.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.823
The whole album,
start to finish.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.892
Must have been
half a dozen times.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.997
I guess what I'm trying
to say is that, uh,

20:31.030 --> 20:32.732
there is no way to prepare.

20:34.867 --> 20:38.405
You just hope
that when that call comes,

20:38.438 --> 20:40.507
you're strong enough to handle
whatever comes next.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.717
I know Missing Persons already
spoke to you about Mr. Alessi.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.419
I keep hoping
this is a bad dream

20:52.452 --> 20:53.920
and Dennis will walk
in that door tomorrow.

20:53.953 --> 20:57.023
Forensics on hair recovered
from your boss's condo

20:57.056 --> 21:00.493
matched blood on a pair of
shoes belonging to our suspect.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.529
So right now, it
doesn't look good.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.897
Why would someone
want to hurt Dennis?

21:04.931 --> 21:07.667
We think the person who did this
accessed your boss's files.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.869
I don't see how anyone
could gain access.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.738
The files are
on a hard drive.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.805
Dennis kept it
in his safe.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.710
(keypad beeping)

21:22.349 --> 21:24.083
This is the only one
that exists.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.986
Are you sure there's
nothing else missing in there?

21:29.121 --> 21:31.924
Dennis kept a key
to a deposit box in here.

21:34.026 --> 21:34.961
It's gone.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.996
- Maybe he had it with him?
- It's possible,

21:37.029 --> 21:38.865
but not likely;
the key belonged to a client.

21:38.898 --> 21:39.866
Who?

21:39.899 --> 21:41.501
Dennis told me
the man was

21:41.534 --> 21:43.936
a special client,
not on the regular list.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.572
He said not to concern myself.

21:48.908 --> 21:49.942
Thanks.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.850
You figure out where
you went wrong?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.521
Not yet.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.065
I guess we both got
a little cocky, huh?

22:13.099 --> 22:15.935
You, with your
math, and...

22:18.004 --> 22:22.609
Well, me, it's a constant state.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.910
It's usually Don who has
to protect me from myself.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.012
He's been doing that for me
my whole life.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.682
You were right
about our teacher of the year.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.118
So, you want to
go two for two?

22:32.151 --> 22:35.488
It's financial
guy's client list.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.756
Our bad guys have been
using it to pick targets.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.091
You're thinking I could use this

22:39.125 --> 22:41.461
to predict
where the next victim will be.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.462
Can you?

22:42.495 --> 22:44.397
(sighs)

22:44.431 --> 22:45.498
I could, um...

22:48.067 --> 22:51.604
I could search for commonalities
using a multi-attribute

22:51.638 --> 22:53.573
compositional model.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.107
Thanks.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.776
DAVID:
But what do we have on Alessi?

22:56.809 --> 23:00.012
At least half of his clients
run cash businesses.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.682
Most of them were in trouble
before Alessi took them on.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.518
They went from near-bankrupt
to flush within 18 months.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.887
Sign me up
for his investment seminar.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.121
He had to have been

23:09.155 --> 23:10.690
laundering money
through these businesses.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.791
No wonder none of our
victims are talking.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.493
They all have
something to hide.

23:13.526 --> 23:16.496
Nikki said Alessi's assistant
mentioned he had a client,

23:16.529 --> 23:18.565
kept some kind of stash
in a deposit box.

23:18.598 --> 23:19.666
Key's missing.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.200
We're checking digital files
from the security camera

23:21.233 --> 23:22.168
in Alessi's building,

23:22.201 --> 23:25.037
seeing if we can ID the guy,
and we've got

23:25.071 --> 23:27.707
Charlie working on
Alessi's client list,

23:27.740 --> 23:29.542
trying to find our next target.

23:29.576 --> 23:30.543
He better get a move on.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.145
These guys are due to
strike again tonight.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.986
When's the last time
you slept?

23:40.019 --> 23:42.021
Sleep's not
a priority.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.457
Did you run your analysis
of Alessi's client list?

23:44.491 --> 23:45.625
Yeah.

23:45.658 --> 23:49.462
I got the list of houses.
I set the target priorities.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.197
Who knows if it's right?

23:53.866 --> 23:56.168
I could use fresh eyes.

23:59.138 --> 24:03.175
You're using game theory,
a payoff matrix?

24:03.209 --> 24:05.077
I've analyzed professionals,

24:05.111 --> 24:08.247
thrill criminals, crackhead
smash and grabbers...

24:08.280 --> 24:10.550
None of our suspects
fit those profiles.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.918
Maybe your assumptions
are wrong.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.520
What do you mean?

24:13.553 --> 24:14.854
Maybe these are not robberies.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.690
Let's throw out
our preconceptions

24:17.724 --> 24:19.559
and walk through
the crimes again.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.828
Okay.

24:21.861 --> 24:26.966
So far, each break-in
has started the same way.

24:29.035 --> 24:32.071
The invaders disable
the alarm system

24:32.104 --> 24:35.775
at the master circuit box.

24:35.808 --> 24:39.045
They enter the house through
multiple access points.

24:42.715 --> 24:45.718
Moving through the house...

24:45.752 --> 24:47.019
(water running)

24:47.053 --> 24:50.557
...they use a classic
"seek and subdue" strategy,

24:50.590 --> 24:52.592
zeroing in on the occupants...

24:54.260 --> 24:56.028
(water running)

24:57.697 --> 24:58.598
...taking them by surprise.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.603
Hands.

25:04.637 --> 25:05.605
(grunting)

25:06.906 --> 25:08.608
(water running)

25:08.641 --> 25:10.543
(grunting)

25:12.111 --> 25:15.582
In every instance, they were
cautious, made zero mistakes.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.917
There was one significant
departure from their previous

25:17.950 --> 25:19.552
MO on the night
Don got hurt.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.654
The fifth man
in the guesthouse.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.022
What was he doing there?

25:23.055 --> 25:24.557
The police said
there was nothing of value,

25:24.591 --> 25:28.761
just some cans of food,
water, old clothes...

25:28.795 --> 25:30.296
A bed.

25:30.329 --> 25:33.700
A bed and a bathroom.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.669
A place to sleep.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.605
A place to wash up.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.713
- There it is.
- What?

25:46.746 --> 25:49.248
18 months ago, that guesthouse
underwent renovations.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.985
They retrofitted the walls
with concrete, three feet thick.

25:53.019 --> 25:56.355
They installed steel doors,
tempered glass windows.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.892
They turned that room
into a fortress.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.227
Robbery wasn't
their motive.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.730
CHARLIE:
They were after something else.

26:03.763 --> 26:04.764
AMITA:
The fifth man.

26:04.797 --> 26:08.601
CHARLIE:
He wasn't part of their crew.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.603
He was their target.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.338
(car engines starting)

26:22.414 --> 26:23.349
(elevator bell dings)

26:25.117 --> 26:26.218
Hey.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.120
Got the ID on the three bad guys
we picked up last night.

26:29.321 --> 26:33.760
Boris Ancic, Ivan Radman,
Milan Jankovic.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.195
Ancic is an engineer,
Radman a lab tech,

26:36.228 --> 26:38.130
and Jankovic a fireman.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.132
Just like our teacher,

26:40.166 --> 26:41.133
none of them have a record.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.636
They're all from the same small
town in Croatia,

26:43.670 --> 26:45.137
a place called Brezko.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.206
They immigrated to the
U.S. about 12 years ago.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.676
It doesn't explain why four guys
with no criminal records

26:49.709 --> 26:52.712
wait 12 years and then turn into
hardened crooks overnight.

26:52.745 --> 26:55.081
Yeah, well, I can fill in
some of those blanks.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.053
We went back.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.755
We took a look at
all the targeted homes.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.057
Each one of them underwent
a renovation of some sort

27:05.091 --> 27:07.059
whether it be to the attic,

27:07.093 --> 27:08.861
or the basement,
or the guesthouse.

27:08.895 --> 27:12.899
In each case, creating a panic
room, a secure place to hide.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.167
Okay, I'm not sure I understand
the significance, Charlie.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.737
All of the renovations
in all of the homes

27:17.770 --> 27:20.306
occurred within
the last 18 months.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.041
That's the same time frame

27:22.074 --> 27:23.676
Alessi started his most recent
money-laundering venture.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.878
The panic room,
the location of the houses

27:25.912 --> 27:28.180
on defensible terrain,
the multiple egresses--

27:28.214 --> 27:30.082
all consistent with safe houses.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.118
The man you and Don
ran into that night

27:32.151 --> 27:33.385
was not part of that crew.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.722
He was hiding out,
trying to escape.

27:35.755 --> 27:38.424
Alessi handpicked his clients,

27:38.457 --> 27:39.892
and not just because
they were willing

27:39.926 --> 27:41.027
to hide dirty money for him.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.929
But because they were willing
to hide something else.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.196
Someone else.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.331
The fifth man.

27:45.364 --> 27:48.134
NIKKI: It's time to have another
talk with our victims.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.102
COLBY: Maybe you want Nikki in
on this one.

27:50.136 --> 27:54.240
Seems like you and I have been
a little out of sync, you know?

27:54.273 --> 27:55.274
Look, man,
we're partners.

27:55.307 --> 27:58.811
But right now... I'm your boss,

27:58.845 --> 28:01.147
and I need you
to follow my lead.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.481
We have to play this one smart.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.150
Yeah, it's not easy
when I think about Don.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.120
I know.

28:08.154 --> 28:11.223
Look, man, the things I said,
uh, you know,

28:11.257 --> 28:12.291
about what Don would have
done...

28:12.324 --> 28:14.861
Forget about it.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.096
He'll be back soon enough
and you can give him crap.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.899
Come on.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.907
DAVID:
I got to hand it to you guys.

28:27.940 --> 28:31.110
You sure know how to pick
a financial adviser.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.479
Most people are losing money
these days.

28:33.512 --> 28:36.515
You two--
you're making it hand over fist.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.317
We've been
very fortunate.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.153
Yeah, well,
I think your luck just ran out.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.254
A year and a half ago,

28:42.288 --> 28:44.857
you were about to go belly-up
and lose your house.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.192
In walks Dennis Alessi.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.394
Suddenly everything
just turns around.

28:48.427 --> 28:51.263
The IRS is already
taking a hard look.

28:51.297 --> 28:55.501
We make a few calls and
things can go better for you.

28:55.534 --> 28:56.969
Or they could go worse.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.076
Okay, fine.
Have it your way.

29:06.478 --> 29:07.814
We had no choice.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.181
- Sarah!
- They know, Gil.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.082
It is over.

29:14.220 --> 29:15.988
Alessi said he had
a client in Europe

29:16.022 --> 29:16.823
that needed
to get money out.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.290
And we thought it would end
there.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.291
DAVID: But it didn't.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.292
He said his client needed

29:20.326 --> 29:22.428
somewhere safe to stay,
just for a little while.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.530
And then he retrofitted
the guesthouse.

29:24.563 --> 29:27.266
He turned it into this bunker.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.369
We were already in so deep.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.271
Who is he?

29:32.304 --> 29:33.439
Who were you hiding?

29:33.472 --> 29:34.807
No. He'll kill us.

29:34.841 --> 29:35.975
We can protect you.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.910
(snorting)

29:43.315 --> 29:46.986
Look, this guy tried
to murder an FBI agent.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.188
You harbor him now,
you're an accessory.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.025
You just want to be free
of this thing, don't you?

29:54.193 --> 29:58.230
All we want is a name.

29:58.264 --> 30:01.400
That's it.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.335
All right.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.273
All right.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.349
LIZ:
Slobodan Radovic, 48.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.251
He led a Serbian
paramilitary campaign

30:19.285 --> 30:21.387
of ethnic cleansing
during the Balkan War.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.490
Looting cities and towns
along the way, which is how

30:24.523 --> 30:26.525
- he met Alessi.
- Alessi helped Radovic smuggle

30:26.558 --> 30:28.227
his war profits
out of Serbia.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.362
A camera in Alessi's lobby

30:30.396 --> 30:34.200
recorded Radovic making his
customary visit last month.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.167
Now we know who his
special client is.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.103
The guy with the stash
in the deposit box.

30:37.136 --> 30:40.406
Okay, how does all this tie in
to Kardum and his crew?

30:40.439 --> 30:42.441
The Hague indicted Radovic two
years ago for his war crimes.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.276
He fled Serbia
before he could be arrested.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.445
Radovic was accused
of atrocities,

30:46.478 --> 30:50.016
including ethnic cleansing
of the village of Brezko.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.017
That's where Kardum is from.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.018
And the rest of his crew.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.653
So, they weren't out for money--

30:54.686 --> 30:56.388
they were out for revenge.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.392
I can't take it.

31:00.426 --> 31:03.095
I can't take seeing him
like this.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.939
Hey, Charlie, what's going on?

31:12.972 --> 31:15.107
One more robbery case,
one more white-collar fraud,

31:15.141 --> 31:18.110
one more string
of home invasions

31:18.144 --> 31:19.411
by what seems like
a bunch of kids.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.514
I whipped through the analysis
for this case.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.183
Charlie, what the hell
are you talking about?

31:24.216 --> 31:27.086
I'm saying this isn't about
a breakthrough

31:27.119 --> 31:28.287
in cognitive emergence.

31:28.320 --> 31:32.491
I'm saying that this is about
me venting my resentment.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.661
I'm saying
that I'm afraid that...

31:35.694 --> 31:37.663
this wasn't just a mistake.

31:37.696 --> 31:39.431
Beating yourself up
isn't going to help anybody.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.701
You have to decide
where your priorities lie,

31:42.734 --> 31:46.438
because this is the cost
of not deciding.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.519
The smash and grabs
were a cover.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.288
You were after Radovic.

32:02.321 --> 32:06.525
NIKKI: Guy burns down your town,
you want payback.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.160
Towns you can rebuild.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.329
Lives are lost forever.

32:10.362 --> 32:14.400
After the war, I came here
to build new memories.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.702
And then one night in
a bar, you see Alessi,

32:16.735 --> 32:18.971
Radovic's banker.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.239
I mean, I worked so hard
to make a new life.

32:20.272 --> 32:24.476
In that moment,
I could only think of one thing.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.545
Revenge.

32:26.578 --> 32:27.779
I bought him drink,

32:27.813 --> 32:30.449
told him that I was Serbian,
that I'd served with Radovic.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.617
Where did you take him

32:31.650 --> 32:33.352
after the bar?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.521
Does it matter?

32:35.554 --> 32:39.191
Alessi gave you
the list of safe houses,

32:39.225 --> 32:41.293
and then you killed him.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.163
Radovic murdered my family.

32:44.196 --> 32:48.034
Alessi saw to it that
he escaped justice,

32:48.067 --> 32:49.535
protected him.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.103
(spits)

32:53.505 --> 32:55.107
I did what I had to do.

32:55.141 --> 32:58.510
You know about the deposit box?

32:58.544 --> 33:02.381
Alessi tried to trade his life
for its contents,

33:02.414 --> 33:04.650
almost $2 million
in diamonds.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.518
- Where is it?
- A vault...

33:06.552 --> 33:09.455
some jewelry wholesaler.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.123
You have the deposit key,
don't you?

33:12.624 --> 33:15.361
For years...

33:15.394 --> 33:18.530
after the massacre,

33:18.564 --> 33:22.234
I woke at night and I saw
the faces of my family,

33:22.268 --> 33:26.072
and I wished that
I hadn't run.

33:26.105 --> 33:29.141
And I wished...

33:29.175 --> 33:31.410
that I had died with them.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.217
I have friends,

33:38.250 --> 33:41.587
others who wish to see justice
just like me.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.403
If Kardum's got
that key,

33:57.436 --> 33:58.504
he's not giving it up.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.505
Yeah. Search
his place again.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.573
Same for the
rest of his crew.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.275
What?

34:03.309 --> 34:06.312
The only people who know
that Alessi is dead

34:06.345 --> 34:07.646
are Kardum's crew and us.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.248
Now maybe Radovic

34:09.281 --> 34:10.816
thinks that Alessi
is sending his guys after him.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.085
To kill him so he can steal
his diamonds.

34:13.119 --> 34:15.587
And Radovic knows
that Alessi kept that key

34:15.621 --> 34:17.123
to the deposit box
in his safe.

34:39.845 --> 34:41.713
Kardum's right.

34:41.747 --> 34:44.250
Radovic needs
those diamonds.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.751
She couldn't give him
the answers he wanted.

34:45.784 --> 34:49.255
A guy who's gonna do this
isn't gonna give up easy.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.622
That's what I'm counting on.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.266
We searched Kardum
and his buddies' places

35:00.299 --> 35:01.567
for the deposit box key.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.202
No luck.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.471
If Radovic thinks Alessi
is trying to steal his diamonds,

35:05.504 --> 35:07.306
he's gonna keep his eyes
on the stash.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.474
Doesn't do us much good.
We don't have a key

35:08.507 --> 35:09.475
or a location.

35:09.508 --> 35:10.376
You said you had digital video

35:10.409 --> 35:11.777
of Alessi handing
the key to Radovic.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.879
Yeah, from the cameras
in Alessi's lobby.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.315
Show me.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.919
(computer trilling)

35:20.952 --> 35:22.788
All right, stop it there

35:22.821 --> 35:25.257
and zoom in on the key.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.761
(keyboard clicking,
computer trilling)

35:30.862 --> 35:33.199
What good is a picture of a key?

35:33.232 --> 35:35.701
With a little enhancement,
it's worth a thousand bits.

35:35.734 --> 35:39.405
The bumps and valleys
are a numeric bitting code

35:39.438 --> 35:40.606
that correspond to a lock,

35:40.639 --> 35:42.474
which can then be analyzed
from a photo

35:42.508 --> 35:44.576
using a key-bitting program.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.345
Think about how
scientists

35:46.378 --> 35:47.446
map the ocean floor.

35:47.479 --> 35:51.183
A ship on the surface uses sonar
to ping the seabed,

35:51.217 --> 35:53.852
creating a map of all its peaks,
valleys and contours.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.288
Now, a key-bitting program
does the same thing.

35:56.322 --> 35:59.258
Each pixel in the photo
represents a set distance

35:59.291 --> 36:00.559
from the camera
which we can measure,

36:00.592 --> 36:02.494
allowing us to accurately gauge

36:02.528 --> 36:03.929
the height and depth
of each key cut.

36:03.962 --> 36:05.764
Now string together
those measurements,

36:05.797 --> 36:07.466
you have all you need
to make a copy.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.368
That still doesn't tell us
where the box is.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.270
Path minimization should
help us there.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.572
Analyzing the most efficient
routes from point A to point B.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.607
Hey, some of this stuff sticks.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.311
So, we know the deposit box
is located

36:19.345 --> 36:21.447
within a one hour round-trip
from Alessi's office.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.883
We also know the location
of Radovic's safe houses.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.418
Right, if a guy cashes in
a diamond for ten grand,

36:26.452 --> 36:27.419
puts the money in his pocket,

36:27.453 --> 36:29.621
he's gonna want to get
home as quick as he can.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.523
That means we can narrow
our search.

36:31.557 --> 36:32.658
Good. The longer
Radovic is exposed,

36:32.691 --> 36:34.426
the more nervous
he's gonna get.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.899
AMITA:
Your key-bitting program worked.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.601
Galuski cut us a key

36:42.634 --> 36:43.969
on the engineering department's
laser lathe.

36:44.002 --> 36:46.738
He even etched in
the box number and

36:46.772 --> 36:48.507
the manufacturer's stamp
to match the original.

36:51.577 --> 36:54.012
What's the problem?

36:54.045 --> 36:56.582
I'm using Dijkstra's algorithm
and overlaying that

36:56.615 --> 37:00.386
with data from CalTrans
on, uh, on traffic flow,

37:00.419 --> 37:01.553
and it's not working.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.989
You need to rest,
Charlie.

37:04.022 --> 37:07.626
I need to catch
this guy.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.428
For Don or for yourself?

37:13.532 --> 37:16.535
Even if I get an answer, how do
I know if it's the right one?

37:16.568 --> 37:18.504
I don't want to send
David and the guys

37:18.537 --> 37:20.572
on a wild-goose chase
and waste more time.

37:22.474 --> 37:25.677
There's only one way to know
if I'm right.

37:28.714 --> 37:31.383
Don't try and be a hero.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.323
I think we could both use
some coffee.

37:41.493 --> 37:44.396
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

38:01.813 --> 38:03.048
Good book?

38:03.081 --> 38:05.384
No, I've read better.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.523
(computer trilling)

38:16.094 --> 38:17.863
(beeping)

38:22.468 --> 38:24.970
(keypad beeping)

38:25.003 --> 38:26.405
(touch-tones beeping)

38:49.628 --> 38:51.630
You give it back
when you're done.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.699
Thanks.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.550
Hey, Mr. Alessi's man is here.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.051
He's opening the box now.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.583
*

39:55.927 --> 39:57.696
I want my diamonds.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.566
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.703
I saw you leaving
the wholesaler.

40:04.736 --> 40:08.507
I know you work
for Alessi.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.041
You're just an errand boy.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.479
Is it worth your life?

40:16.548 --> 40:18.016
It's worth this moment

40:18.049 --> 40:19.184
right now.

40:19.217 --> 40:22.954
I wanted to see the face
of the man

40:22.988 --> 40:24.523
who stabbed my brother.

40:24.556 --> 40:25.491
Your brother?

40:26.725 --> 40:27.693
The FBI agent?

40:35.501 --> 40:39.237
You got about a second
to keep that knee.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.773
COLBY: Generally, she's a pretty
good shot.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.909
Although, sometimes
she'll miss a little high.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.723
(handcuffs clicking)

41:03.228 --> 41:04.730
Thanks for letting me
play decoy.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.765
We wouldn't have a key

41:06.798 --> 41:09.935
or a location
without you, Charlie.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.670
You earned it.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.038
Is that the only reason?

41:13.071 --> 41:15.774
No.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.110
Hey.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.982
Yeah.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.552
You-you gonna pick
these things up?

41:26.585 --> 41:27.886
Yeah.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.521
(chuckles)
(sighs)

41:29.555 --> 41:31.256
(gentle melody playing)

41:31.289 --> 41:34.726
* Love, love is a verb

41:34.760 --> 41:36.928
* Love is a doing word

41:36.962 --> 41:38.196
(laughs)

41:38.229 --> 41:40.932
Oh, no, another one.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.133
(laughing)

41:44.002 --> 41:45.904
It's not like there's
a lot of choice

41:45.937 --> 41:47.005
in the gift shop.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.541
So, uh, what's the word?

41:49.575 --> 41:50.542
They say

41:50.576 --> 41:51.743
I'm on my feet in a couple days.

41:51.777 --> 41:52.911
Back on all your asses

41:52.944 --> 41:54.913
a week after that, so watch out.

41:54.946 --> 41:55.847
But limited duty.

41:55.881 --> 41:57.315
I have it
in writing,

41:57.348 --> 41:58.617
notarized.

41:58.650 --> 41:59.685
As your relief
supervisor,

41:59.718 --> 42:01.820
you know, I just, I can't wait

42:01.853 --> 42:02.954
to have you back
on the job, so...

42:02.988 --> 42:04.923
It'll be good
having you back, man.

42:04.956 --> 42:05.857
Oh, look at this.

42:05.891 --> 42:08.293
(all laugh)

42:08.326 --> 42:10.962
I don't know how that gift shop
stays in business.

42:10.996 --> 42:12.898
(all laughing)

42:12.931 --> 42:16.167
Well, Charlie, I'm sure you have
some catching up

42:16.201 --> 42:17.769
to do with Don,
so, uh...

42:17.803 --> 42:20.806
Stale coffee in the cafe
on me for everybody.

42:20.839 --> 42:22.608
Bye.

42:22.641 --> 42:23.875
ROBIN:
I'll be back in a bit.

42:25.343 --> 42:27.979
Oh, hey, Donnie, um...

42:28.013 --> 42:29.014
a little
illicit brisket.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.682
Put it under
your pillow.

42:30.716 --> 42:32.283
I made it for you.

42:32.317 --> 42:34.019
I don't think
I can go there.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.787
(chuckles)

42:37.222 --> 42:39.591
So you're playing decoy, huh?

42:40.892 --> 42:42.260
I can't say
I want to do that again.

42:44.029 --> 42:47.032
When we were kids, man,
you had my back.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.936
Protected me.

42:53.004 --> 42:55.273
Charlie, I didn't want
this life for you.

42:55.306 --> 42:57.709
Makes two of us.

42:59.878 --> 43:02.013
All right, get your rest.

43:02.047 --> 43:03.114
You gonna eat this brisket?

43:03.148 --> 43:05.150
No. You take it.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.788
I'll see you at the office,
buddy.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.389
Yeah.

43:11.422 --> 43:12.891
You will.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.927
* Feathers on my breath

43:20.298 --> 43:24.803
* You're stumbling into harm

43:27.005 --> 43:31.877
* You're stumbling into harm.

43:34.379 --> 43:36.948
(song ends)
