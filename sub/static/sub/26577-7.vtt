10:45.860 --> 10:47.176
about what you bring into your house

10:47.200 --> 10:48.219
on the bottom of your shoes,

10:48.220 --> 10:50.440
and it kind of freaked me out.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.660
Oh, yeah, did you not
know the ground was dirty

10:52.670 --> 10:53.679
before reading that?

10:53.680 --> 10:55.159
[LAUGHS]

10:55.160 --> 10:58.620
But, um, still just rather
not take my shoes off,

10:58.630 --> 11:00.940
makes me feel shorter.

11:00.950 --> 11:03.640
I'd rather you would.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.980
Okay.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.060
Oh.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.390
Oh, let's just...

11:12.360 --> 11:16.830
So, I am making vegan paella, huh?

11:17.070 --> 11:20.640
So if you would like to
open up a bottle of wine,

11:20.670 --> 11:23.000
anything red on the bottom
row should be fine.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.280
Oh, this white looks pretty good.

11:25.310 --> 11:30.250
Oh, uh, actually, red
usually stands up better

11:30.280 --> 11:32.460
to a tomato-sauce base.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.020
Any bottle on the bottom row there.

11:34.050 --> 11:35.800
You know, the red.

11:35.850 --> 11:39.560
Uh, if you hate it, then
we can open up a white.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.620
Yeah, I just tried it in
my mind, and I hated it.

11:42.630 --> 11:44.560
[CHUCKLES]

11:44.600 --> 11:46.800
Well, try it in a glass.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.770
You might like it.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.240
Uh, how about I just
help you with the food?

11:51.270 --> 11:52.360
Sure, that would be great.

11:52.370 --> 11:53.780
You can stir the paella.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.110
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.310
Me, too.

12:09.050 --> 12:11.720
Huh?

12:11.760 --> 12:14.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:14.960 --> 12:18.230
It's better to add salt at the table.

12:18.260 --> 12:20.450
Well, let me just add a little,

12:20.460 --> 12:22.220
and you'll see that you like it.

12:23.280 --> 12:26.700
I tried it in my mind, and I hated it.

12:27.240 --> 12:30.440
You can't just grab something out
of my hand like I'm a child.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.980
I'm sorry.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.510
May I have the salt?

12:33.550 --> 12:35.600
- No.
- Please let go.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.460
- No, you let go.
- It's my salt.

12:37.480 --> 12:38.540
I'll buy you a new one.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.320
I asked you to stir, not season.

12:40.350 --> 12:41.760
I thought you're glad I'm here.

12:41.770 --> 12:44.520
I am. I'm just not
glad you're seasoning.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.520
Why are you fighting with me?

12:46.560 --> 12:47.830
I...

12:47.860 --> 12:50.030
Man, I spent hours
getting everything ready

12:50.060 --> 12:52.030
to show you a nice evening.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.870
Why can't you just
relax, enjoy yourself?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.270
Why can't you just let me enjoy myself

12:57.300 --> 12:59.370
the way I want to enjoy myself?

12:59.400 --> 13:01.740
Because the only way that
you can enjoy yourself

13:01.760 --> 13:04.480
is by making me not enjoy myself.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.450
Oh, well, I'm sorry I'm
ruining your evening.

13:07.460 --> 13:08.580
I'm getting my shoes.

13:08.610 --> 13:10.299
You can't wear them in here.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.650
I know.

13:12.260 --> 13:13.750
Well, where are you going?

13:13.790 --> 13:16.880
Home, to cook in my shoes
and salt everything.

13:19.620 --> 13:21.600
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hi.

13:21.640 --> 13:22.960
What are you doing here?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.470
I-I'm sorry. That sounded rude.

13:24.510 --> 13:26.640
Uh, what are you doing
here instead of David,

13:26.650 --> 13:28.740
who I wish was here instead of you?

13:28.760 --> 13:30.299
Well, he couldn't come,

13:30.300 --> 13:33.340
so I'll be going over the kids'
Christmas lists with you.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.720
I'll just wait for you at that table.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.450
Just throw something in a cup.

13:37.470 --> 13:38.740
I got to get out of here.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.540
The real reason I'm here

13:41.550 --> 13:44.510
is I'm having some problems with David.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.620
Mm.

13:46.630 --> 13:49.170
Well, look, I really don't
want to get involved,

13:49.200 --> 13:50.446
and I got to go back to the counter

13:50.470 --> 13:51.580
so someone doesn't grab my c...

13:51.600 --> 13:52.600
Oh.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.640
Thank you for doing something
you guys rarely do

13:54.670 --> 13:57.080
at the worst possible time.

13:57.220 --> 14:00.479
Okay, so, the problem with David

14:00.480 --> 14:02.380
is he's afraid to make decisions.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.280
It doesn't matter if
it's choosing a doctor

14:04.300 --> 14:06.100
or potato chips.

14:06.130 --> 14:07.870
How did you deal with that?

14:07.900 --> 14:09.370
I can't help you. I found the fact

14:09.400 --> 14:10.620
that he was born without a backbone

14:10.630 --> 14:12.259
one of his best features.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.860
[SCOFFS]

14:13.880 --> 14:16.600
I guess I'm just gonna have to
get him to see a therapist.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.039
Just don't over-fix him.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.856
There are guys that want
to make all the decisions,

14:19.880 --> 14:22.320
and that's way more annoying.

14:23.350 --> 14:25.120
You seem super tense.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.190
Uh, what ya doing there?

14:32.260 --> 14:34.900
I used to be a massage therapist.

14:34.930 --> 14:36.900
Are you dating a guy who's bossy?

14:36.930 --> 14:40.520
Uh, I-I really don't want to
talk about this with you.

14:40.540 --> 14:44.470
Sometimes saying it out
loud really helps.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.380
Just pretend like I'm not even here.

14:46.610 --> 14:49.280
Oh, I like that.

14:49.310 --> 14:51.510
Um...

14:51.550 --> 14:54.180
All right, uh, I started dating my boss.

14:54.220 --> 14:57.490
He's really controlling, and, you know,

14:57.520 --> 14:58.736
I don't think it's gonna work out.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.819
Well, one thing I learned
in a previous job,

15:00.820 --> 15:02.460
before massage therapy,

15:02.490 --> 15:05.960
is that people who have a
lot of responsibilities,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.570
secretly, they want to give
up control to someone else.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.960
Nobody I know.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.370
Oh, believe me.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.599
Once they were strapped
in and had the mask on

15:16.600 --> 15:19.650
and gave up total control to me,

15:19.680 --> 15:22.380
they... they seemed pretty happy.

15:22.410 --> 15:23.620
[LAUGHS]

15:23.630 --> 15:24.920
[CHUCKLES]

15:24.950 --> 15:27.420
Um, unless you were an anesthesiologist,

15:27.450 --> 15:30.320
I think you're telling me
you were a dominatrix.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.120
It was a long time ago,

15:32.160 --> 15:34.980
and I was the opposite
of an anesthesiologist.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.930
I, you know, brought a lot of pain.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.200
And the one thing I learned

15:43.230 --> 15:46.840
is that giving up control
can make people happier.

15:46.970 --> 15:48.410
Yeah, not this guy.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.800
He wouldn't even give up the salt.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.080
I'm talking about you.

15:53.110 --> 15:54.840
Give him a chance to lead.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.320
You might like it.

15:56.410 --> 15:59.180
Well, thanks for the advice.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.850
Oh, and by the way,

16:02.890 --> 16:04.860
now that I know you're a dominatrix,

16:04.890 --> 16:07.260
you and David make way more sense.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.230
I'm here to write you a
check for the Vespa parts.

16:13.730 --> 16:16.940
Heard you had a nice chat with Peter.

16:17.670 --> 16:19.800
We had a chat.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.600
What'd you talk about?

16:21.740 --> 16:24.340
Oh, we touched on a lot of things.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.880
We had a wide-ranging discussion
about a variety of topics.

16:29.500 --> 16:34.699
Did you threaten to loofah
his face with a brick wall?

16:34.700 --> 16:37.090
We may have covered that.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.950
And did you talk about how you think

16:38.960 --> 16:40.520
he's taking advantage of me

16:40.560 --> 16:42.780
and how I'm a stupid old woman?

16:42.800 --> 16:43.810
No.

16:43.820 --> 16:45.260
Have you noticed that I'm talking

16:45.300 --> 16:47.600
increasingly louder and louder?

16:47.630 --> 16:50.019
I... I had begun to notice that, yes.

16:50.020 --> 16:52.270
How dare you talk to my boyfriend

16:52.300 --> 16:54.880
about things that are
private between him and me?

16:54.910 --> 16:56.640
You're in denial about this guy.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.280
All you do is give, and
all he does is take.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.700
You're totally wrong.

17:00.810 --> 17:02.350
He treats me well, Dan.

17:02.380 --> 17:05.878
It's an equal relationship,
and he gives me so much.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.290
We have fun together.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.890
We talk. We... We... We discuss books.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.959
He brings me pancakes in bed.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.760
I don't think you understand
how much pancakes cost.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.279
You asked me to be a sounding board

17:18.280 --> 17:20.050
like Rosie used to be.

17:20.069 --> 17:21.730
I'm just doing what she would've done.

17:21.770 --> 17:24.700
Roseanne would've come to me first

17:24.740 --> 17:26.670
and tried to break down my self-esteem

17:26.700 --> 17:27.710
until I broke up with him,

17:27.720 --> 17:32.120
and you did not show
me the same respect.

17:32.180 --> 17:34.450
Look, I'm keeping my eye on this guy.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.900
I don't want to see you get hurt.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.360
Well, thank you for caring.

17:37.370 --> 17:39.260
I'm a grown woman. I can handle myself.

17:39.270 --> 17:40.840
- Do we understand each other?
- We do.

17:40.850 --> 17:42.399
And we both know that
we love each other.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.480
- We do.
- And if you ever do

17:43.490 --> 17:44.490
something like this again,

17:44.500 --> 17:47.040
I will move in here, and so help me,

17:47.130 --> 17:50.060
I will bring Mom with me.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.070
Morning.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.480
Good morning.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.880
Okay, come on. Are we gonna
talk about last night or what?

18:02.910 --> 18:04.540
Oh, not necessary.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.099
Last night was personal.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.100
This is business. Let's just work.

18:08.180 --> 18:09.820
If that's what you want.

18:10.690 --> 18:14.340
So, I know you wanted to
do a cover of mug shots,

18:14.360 --> 18:15.820
people who were all born this month

18:15.860 --> 18:17.900
and call it "Born Under a Bad Sign,"

18:17.960 --> 18:22.900
but I was thinking of doing
a grouping by hair color

18:22.930 --> 18:26.820
and calling it "Blondes Have More Guns."

18:30.940 --> 18:32.410
Sounds fine.

18:32.540 --> 18:35.980
That's a weird way of
saying something sucks.

18:36.010 --> 18:38.060
No, really. It's fine.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.250
Um, certainly not worth fighting over.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.090
Well, since you're in
such an agreeable mood,

18:44.120 --> 18:46.190
here's another idea I just had.

18:46.220 --> 18:49.000
We do an all-woman edition
under the headline

18:49.060 --> 18:50.900
"Bitches Be Crazy."

18:55.900 --> 18:57.530
That may not be well-received.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.740
I think you're pushing my buttons,

19:00.750 --> 19:01.800
but I'm not gonna give in.

19:01.820 --> 19:03.620
I'm just gonna sit here and try to find

19:03.630 --> 19:06.920
the pressure points that
my dominatrix taught me.

19:11.180 --> 19:12.510
More on that later.

19:12.550 --> 19:13.860
But...

19:13.880 --> 19:16.380
Come on. Let's talk about
last night, please?

19:16.420 --> 19:19.440
I am sorry that I got upset.

19:19.620 --> 19:21.890
You know, I'm just used
to being the only alpha

19:21.900 --> 19:23.160
in a relationship.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.390
Me too.

19:25.430 --> 19:28.300
Can two alphas have a
relationship that works?

19:28.330 --> 19:31.480
Both of us just have to let go.

19:31.540 --> 19:34.820
So, you're saying we
just have a relationship

19:34.900 --> 19:37.810
with no plan at all, no safeguards,

19:37.840 --> 19:39.640
nobody leading, just trust...

19:39.680 --> 19:41.920
Oh, I can't breathe.

19:43.150 --> 19:47.080
Okay, so, I am gonna trust you.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.620
You're gonna trust me.

19:49.650 --> 19:52.420
And we may end up ripping
each other's hearts out.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.260
I'm in.

19:55.690 --> 19:56.890
Me too.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.620
All right, let's get back to work.

20:06.660 --> 20:10.399
Hey, who tore the eyes
out of the hot blonde

20:10.400 --> 20:12.040
that was going on the cover?

20:13.710 --> 20:17.100
Could've been anybody. Bitches be crazy.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.340
HARRIS: Can I talk to
you guys for a minute?

20:22.690 --> 20:25.400
I have a question about relationships.

20:25.460 --> 20:29.000
[BOTH GROAN]

20:29.030 --> 20:31.890
Okay, so, there's this boy at
school that I want to date,

20:31.920 --> 20:33.430
but he wants me to be exclusive.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.480
How do I decide?

20:34.520 --> 20:36.690
Don't ask anybody about
your relationships.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.510
They just want to get all
up in your business.

20:38.540 --> 20:39.680
It's a big aggravation.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.340
Die alone. It's easier.

20:43.550 --> 20:44.570
Mom?

20:44.580 --> 20:46.250
Oh, man.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.820
Relationship dynamics
are so complicated.

20:48.850 --> 20:50.859
You zig, and then they zag,

20:50.860 --> 20:53.090
then you zig, and then they zig.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.400
It's all like one big cosmic yank.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.300
I guess I'll go ask Aunt Becky.

20:58.310 --> 20:59.440
