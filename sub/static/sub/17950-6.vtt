02:29.067 --> 02:30.500
- YOU MADE ME LOSE CONNECTION
WITH JO,

02:30.500 --> 02:32.400
AND SHE CAN'T CHAT
FOR ANOTHER HOUR.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.400
- OKAY, IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER

07:13.133 --> 07:15.700
SO DON'T GO ON KENDORK.COM,

07:15.700 --> 07:17.967
BECAUSE THAT WILL JUST

07:36.067 --> 07:37.500
- WELL,
'CAUSE THEY'RE JUST HATERS.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.800
AND WE KNEW THAT YOU'D
GET UPSET.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.133

07:49.800 --> 07:52.400
I LIKE TOUR BUS QUIET TIME,
SO GAME OFF, PLEASE.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
THANK YOU.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.333
- WELL,
I TRIED TO NAP,

07:56.333 --> 07:59.233
AND WE ALL REMEMBER HOW SUCKY
THAT TURNED OUT, HMM?

07:59.233 --> 08:02.500
- BUT I KNOW YOU LIKE NOISE,
SO I ADDED A LAYER OF COMFORT

08:02.500 --> 08:05.100
FOR BOTH OF US.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.633
[static and birds chirping]

08:07.633 --> 08:10.600

[static and birds chirping]

08:15.167 --> 08:17.733
ISN'T THAT NICE?

08:17.733 --> 08:18.667
- EEE!

08:20.833 --> 08:24.900
- OH, OKAY, SO NOW YOU'RE
UNAPPRECIATIVE AND NOT NICE.

08:24.900 --> 08:28.533
- NO, WHAT'S NOT NICE IS THAT
I DREW THE SHORT STRAW

08:28.533 --> 08:32.167
SIX DAYS IN ROW AND HAVE TO
SHARE THIS BUS WITH YOU.

08:32.167 --> 08:35.433
- RIGHT, YOU GUYS DRAW STRAWS
TO SEE WHO'S LUCKY ENOUGH

08:35.433 --> 08:37.400
TO RIDE WITH ME,
TO ENJOY MY COMPANY,

08:37.400 --> 08:40.333
AND MY TASTY SNACKS.

08:40.333 --> 08:44.400
- NO. IT'S THE LOSER THAT RIDES
WITH YOU, NOT THE WINNER.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.867
WE HATE RIDING WITH YOU.

08:49.333 --> 08:52.800
- I THINK I'D LIKE TO BE
ALONE NOW.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.067
[tires screeching]

08:59.633 --> 09:01.367
- FINE.
WE'RE STUCK IN TRAFFIC.

09:01.367 --> 09:04.200
SO YOU CAN HAVE THE BLUE BUS
ALL TO YOURSELF.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.533
WELL, JAMES I'M--
I'M NOT DONE TALKING WITH YOU.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.733

JAMES.

09:12.733 --> 09:14.833
I AM NOT DONE TALKING TO YOU.

09:14.833 --> 09:17.867
- OKAY, WELL,
IF THEY'RE JUST GONNA HATE US,

09:17.867 --> 09:20.733
THEN I'M GONNA COMMENT BACK
AND HATE THEM.

09:20.733 --> 09:21.900
HA!

09:21.900 --> 09:24.233
- HATING A HATER
MAKES YOU A HATER.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.767
- JAMES,
I'M NOT DONE TALKING TO YOU.

09:27.767 --> 09:28.800
JAMES.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.467
DO YOU GUYS DRAWS STRAWS
BECAUSE YOU HATE RIDING WITH ME?

09:39.067 --> 09:40.067
- MAYBE.

09:40.067 --> 09:42.767
- HATER!
- OH, I'M A HATER?

09:42.767 --> 09:45.933
- HEY, WHILE WE'RE ALL HERE,

09:45.933 --> 09:48.167
WHY DON'T WE MAKE
A LITTLE TOUR BUS VIDEO

09:48.167 --> 09:50.800
TO SHOW HOW MUCH FUN WE HAVE
ON THE TOUR BUS?

09:50.800 --> 09:53.667
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
THESE TOUR BUS RIDES WOULD BE

09:53.667 --> 09:55.300
WITHOUT ME?

09:55.300 --> 09:57.100
- UM...FUN.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.367
- CHEERIER,
A LITTLE CHEERIER.

09:59.367 --> 10:02.133
- I'M CHEERIER,
BECAUSE I'M ON THE BROWN BUS

10:02.133 --> 10:03.133
WITH BROWN BUS RULES.

10:03.133 --> 10:04.167
- VERY FUNNY.

10:04.167 --> 10:05.467
DID YOU EVEN NOTICE
THAT THERE IS

10:05.467 --> 10:06.667
A MASSIVE TRAFFIC JAM OUTSIDE,

10:06.667 --> 10:09.167
OR DO YOU NEED BAD BUSMATE LOGAN
TO POINT OUT

[horn honks]

10:38.000 --> 10:39.333

10:39.333 --> 10:40.400
YOU DIDN'T SAY "HONK BONK."

10:40.400 --> 10:41.400
- OW.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
- CHEESE.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.400
- ALTHOUGH I AM CLEARLY
NEEDED HERE,

10:45.400 --> 10:47.633
I REALIZE I AM NOT WANTED.

10:47.633 --> 10:50.200
SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY
GOOD-BYE...

10:50.200 --> 10:52.233
FOREVER.

10:52.233 --> 10:55.033
- I'M JUST GONNA TURN THIS OFF

10:58.000 --> 11:00.467
[horns honking]

11:00.467 --> 11:04.100

WHAT I'M GONNA SAY.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.067
[horns honking]

11:37.067 --> 11:38.700
- STILL NO RELIEF FROM THE HEAT,
SAN DIEGO,

11:38.700 --> 11:41.100
OR WHAT EVERYONE IS CALLING
TRAFFIC JAM-ZILLA.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.667
IT'S 7:15.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.300
- WE'RE MISSING VICTORIA

12:07.467 --> 12:08.833
QUICK,
ROLL UP THE WINDOWS.

12:08.833 --> 12:10.767
- HE'S JUST SELLING ORANGES
OUT OF A SHOPPING CART

12:10.767 --> 12:11.933
ON THE HIGHWAY.

12:11.933 --> 12:14.100
- WHY IS YOUR GENERATION
OKAY WITH THAT?

12:14.100 --> 12:16.067
ROLL UP THE WINDOWS.

12:45.633 --> 12:47.400
- THEY'RE STUCK ON THE HIGHWAY
IN JAM-ZILLA.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.333
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT.

12:50.367 --> 12:52.200
- HOW MANY ENCORES DO YOU NEED?

12:52.200 --> 12:55.467
- 2...5...

12:55.467 --> 12:57.067

- WHERE ARE MY GUYS?

13:06.967 --> 13:08.267
[horns honking]

13:19.133 --> 13:23.167
- DO YOU THINK IT'S EASY
RIDING WITH YOU AND YOUR STUFF?

13:23.167 --> 13:25.700
DO YOU THINK THE BUS
MAGICALLY CLEANS ITSELF?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.067
DO YOU THINK YOUR BREAD

13:29.067 --> 13:30.533
MAGICALLY DOESN'T HAVE
ANY CRUST?

13:30.533 --> 13:31.700
- MMM.

TO OCEAN BREEZE.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.100
- I WILL NEVER MISS THAT.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.567
- OKAY, WELL,
MAYBE THIS THING IS STUPID,

13:42.567 --> 13:43.700
BUT LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.433
WHENEVER YOU RIDE
WITH LOGAN MITCHELL,

13:45.433 --> 13:47.067
YOU RIDE IN FIRST CLASS.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.300
LOZENGES ARE ALWAYS LAID OUT
IN CASE OUR THROATS ARE SORE.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.500

14:18.633 --> 14:20.300
OH, WHAT'S UP, HATER?

14:20.300 --> 14:22.167
- I DO NOT HATE,

14:22.167 --> 14:24.800
WHICH IS WHY I'M SIMPLY POSTING
A STATEMENT

14:24.800 --> 14:28.133
ON IHATEBTR.COM
SIMPLY SUGGESTING

14:28.133 --> 14:30.100
THAT THEIR OPINION IS INCORRECT.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.100
- NO, YOU'RE JUST FUELING
THE HATER FIRE

14:33.100 --> 14:34.800
BY GIVING THEM WHAT THEY WANT.

14:36.533 --> 14:38.600
- "DEAR SIR OR MADAM,

14:38.600 --> 14:40.167
"I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE
WITH YOU

14:40.167 --> 14:42.767
THAT JO AND KENDALL
ARE AN 'EYEBROW' COUPLE."

14:42.767 --> 14:43.700

14:56.233 --> 14:57.433
[computer chimes]

14:57.433 --> 14:59.200
THAT WAS FAST.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.067

16:17.333 --> 16:19.100
[both chuckling]

16:19.100 --> 16:20.133
- FUNNY, RIGHT?

16:20.133 --> 16:21.967
- I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE SONGS.

16:21.967 --> 16:23.900
- YOU HAVE A CHRISTMAS ALBUM,
RIGHT?

16:23.900 --> 16:24.967
- GUSTAVO, IT'S JUNE.

16:24.967 --> 16:27.500
- BUT IT'S AN AMAZING ALBUM.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.267
NOW,
GET OUT THERE AND SING IT!

16:32.467 --> 16:34.433

REMEMBER?

16:34.433 --> 16:37.100
- RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT PLEASE LIPS?

16:37.100 --> 16:41.133

17:06.800 --> 17:09.067
- OKAY,
I MIGHT MISS FIRST CLASS.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.533
BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
YOU'RE NOT EASY

17:10.533 --> 17:12.167
TO TOUR BUS WITH EITHER.

17:12.167 --> 17:15.633
- FINE, I MIGHT ADMIT THAT
IF YOU APOLOGIZE.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.833
- DO I GET A SANDWICH?

17:21.433 --> 17:23.133
- YOU MIGHT.

17:23.133 --> 17:25.400
- THEN I APOLOGIZE.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.967
OOH.

17:26.967 --> 17:29.267
AND I PROPOSE A NEW
BLUE BUS RULE

THAT GAME?

17:47.500 --> 17:48.900
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.400
- SERIOUSLY?

17:50.400 --> 17:52.800
HOW DO THESE HATERS
NOT BOTHER YOU GUYS?

17:52.800 --> 17:55.433
- BECAUSE OF EMILYJ3.

17:55.433 --> 17:57.867
- WHO IS EMILYJ3?

17:57.867 --> 17:59.400
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.800
BUT SHE DID ONCE POST
THAT SHE HAD A BAD DATE,

18:02.800 --> 18:05.500
AND MY SINGING MADE IT BETTER.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.667

SHE SAYS I'M THE ONLY PERSON
THAT MAKES HER SMILE 24-7.

18:10.933 --> 18:13.433

- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

18:14.433 --> 18:16.300
DO YOU HAVE AN EMILYJ3?

18:16.300 --> 18:19.067
