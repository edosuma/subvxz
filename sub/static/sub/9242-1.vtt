Can you believe that? A musical
version of "Sweet Bird of Youth."

01:30.176 --> 01:33.373
- Who are they kidding?
- Thank God, you wanted to leave.

01:33.446 --> 01:37.177
Can you believe Madeline Ashton?
Talk about waking the dead.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.775

Whoo!

05:00.997 --> 05:03.261
Whoo!

05:04.500 --> 05:08.834
Wrinkled, wrinkled little star,

05:08.905 --> 05:12.637
hope they never see the scars.

05:18.415 --> 05:21.009
Your guests are here,
Miss Ashton.

05:21.085 --> 05:23.781
A Miss Helen Sharp
with a gentleman.

05:23.854 --> 05:27.153
- Ahh. How's she look?
- Who?

05:27.224 --> 05:29.624
Helen, you idiot.

05:29.693 --> 05:32.390
I don't know.
Smart, I guess, sort of classy.

05:32.464 --> 05:35.262
Classy? Really?
Compared to whom?

05:35.333 --> 05:39.565
Oh, shit.

05:56.555 --> 05:58.182
Mad!

05:58.257 --> 06:00.817
Hel!

06:03.396 --> 06:06.331
- I don't believe it.
- How are you?

06:06.399 --> 06:08.458
- It's been so long.
- I know.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.470
Don't you dare say how long.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.666
Mad, I'd like you to meet...

06:14.741 --> 06:16.709
Dr. Ernest Menville, my fiance.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.507
You were just wonderful.

06:19.579 --> 06:22.377
Ernest Menville? Dr. Ernest
Menville, the plastic surgeon?

06:22.449 --> 06:26.715
- Yes. You were so terrific!
- Ernest is quite a fan.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.551
- I've read all about you.
- That dance number. Boy, oh, boy.

06:29.623 --> 06:33.116
- I can't believe I'm meeting you.
- He never mentioned a Madeline thing.

06:33.194 --> 06:38.222
- We're both huge fans.
- I'm sure he doesn't have a... thing.

06:38.299 --> 06:41.359
Do you?

06:41.436 --> 06:46.965
Well, I'm so happy
for you... both.

06:47.041 --> 06:51.035
What ever happened to that,
um, writing thing?

06:51.113 --> 06:55.174
- Oh, well, um, I'm still trying.
- Helen, don't be modest.

06:55.250 --> 06:59.710
- She's a brilliant writer, Mrs. Ashton.
- Miss.

06:59.788 --> 07:02.154
Tell me, Doctor,

07:02.224 --> 07:05.682
do you think that
I'm starting to need you?

07:06.962 --> 07:08.327
Ahem.

07:08.397 --> 07:10.889
So...

07:12.469 --> 07:14.437
have you two set a date?

07:14.504 --> 07:16.870
- Yes... we have.
- No, actually--

07:18.408 --> 07:22.310
We see the upper
eyelid skin incision...

07:22.379 --> 07:25.815
from the medial canthus
to the lateral orbital margin.

07:25.882 --> 07:28.976
There are two fat compartments in the
upper eyelid, three in the lower.

07:29.052 --> 07:31.715
Oops. Look at all this bleeding.

07:31.789 --> 07:36.089
Needle-tip cautery. Quickly, please.

07:41.599 --> 07:45.000
For heaven's sake,
Helen, it was a dinner.

07:45.069 --> 07:47.765
The woman wanted
my professional opinion.

07:47.838 --> 07:51.070
Ernest, you don't know Madeline
the way I do.

07:51.143 --> 07:54.840
She wants you. She wants
you because you're mine.

07:54.913 --> 07:57.347
I've lost men to her before.

07:57.416 --> 08:01.443
She just turns on that flash
and that glitter and they're gone.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.580
That's why I wanted you to meet
her before we got married.

08:04.656 --> 08:09.457
I just had to see if you could
pass the Madeline Ashton test.

08:09.528 --> 08:13.124
Please...
Please, don't fail.

08:13.199 --> 08:17.192
I couldn't take it again.

08:17.270 --> 08:19.864
I don't know what I'd do.

08:19.939 --> 08:24.171
Do you know how
silly you're sounding?

08:25.478 --> 08:27.537
Oh, darling,

08:27.613 --> 08:32.176
I have absolutely no interest
in Madeline Ashton.

09:52.035 --> 09:55.562
Mrs. Helen Sharp? It's your landlord.
Open the door, please.

09:55.639 --> 09:58.574
I know you're in there!

09:58.642 --> 10:01.475
I have your final
eviction notice.

10:01.545 --> 10:03.604
If you don't come out,

10:03.680 --> 10:07.980
- I'm going to break the door.
- What are you doing here?

10:08.051 --> 10:11.419
I have the police. If you don't open,
we're going to break the door.

10:11.489 --> 10:16.392
- Well, speak!
- I'm going to charge you for it too.

10:16.461 --> 10:21.228
- Lady, let's go.
- You heard what he said.

10:25.536 --> 10:30.030
You're in trouble.

10:30.109 --> 10:34.375
Come on. Open it!

10:48.494 --> 10:52.659
Lady, listen. You have the
right to remain silent.

10:52.732 --> 10:55.166
If you give up the right
to remain silent--

10:55.235 --> 10:58.329
Are you nuts?

10:58.405 --> 11:00.737
Come on.
Get her outta here!

11:00.807 --> 11:02.968
So...

11:06.046 --> 11:08.139
What about you, Helen?

11:08.214 --> 11:12.083
We haven't heard from you
in a while.

11:12.153 --> 11:15.316
Is there anything...

11:15.389 --> 11:19.325
you'd like to...
talk about... with the group?

11:26.100 --> 11:28.068
Yes.

11:32.474 --> 11:36.274
I would like to talk about...

11:36.344 --> 11:39.609
Madeline...

11:39.681 --> 11:41.046
Ashton.

11:41.116 --> 11:43.346
Stop! Stop it!
Stop!

11:43.418 --> 11:46.216
No! No!

11:51.961 --> 11:54.327
Is this where we are, Helen?

11:54.397 --> 11:57.764
Six months of therapy.
You're not one pound lighter.

11:57.834 --> 12:00.735
And we are still talking
about Madeline Ashton!

12:00.803 --> 12:04.569
- You think I enjoy talking about her?
- Do you think I enjoy it?

12:04.640 --> 12:07.632
Is that what you think?
You better think again!

12:07.710 --> 12:12.375
Oh, Helen,
for you to have a life,

12:12.449 --> 12:15.850
for any of us to have a life,

12:15.919 --> 12:18.012
you have got to forget
about her.

12:18.088 --> 12:20.488
You have to erase her
from your mind.

12:20.557 --> 12:24.254
- You have to completely eliminate any--
- What?

12:24.328 --> 12:27.354
You have to completely
eliminate--

12:27.431 --> 12:29.922
You're right.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.366
What?

12:31.436 --> 12:35.236
You're absolutely right.

12:53.492 --> 12:55.426
Yes?

12:55.494 --> 12:59.396
I have a delivery for Madeline
Ashton and Dr. Ernest Menville.

13:34.535 --> 13:36.901
Good morning, madam.

13:36.971 --> 13:40.873
You look absolutely marvelous.

13:40.942 --> 13:43.342
Hey, wait a minute.

13:44.512 --> 13:46.946
Aren't you forgetting something?

13:47.014 --> 13:50.109
- It's only Thursday. I'm supposed to--
- Never mind.

13:50.185 --> 13:53.245
I think I need you
to say it every morning.

13:53.322 --> 13:55.483
Very well.

13:55.557 --> 13:58.117
Oh, madam,
you look younger every day.

13:58.193 --> 14:01.890
Thank you, Rose.
Thank you very much.

14:01.964 --> 14:04.091
It's so sweet--
What is this?

14:04.166 --> 14:08.500
Your tickets for
Helen Sharp's book party.

14:08.570 --> 14:11.369
They just came.

14:11.441 --> 14:14.740
Helen Sharp's book party!

14:14.811 --> 14:17.780
- "Forever Young"?
- I like that title.

14:20.516 --> 14:24.213
Oh, forever young!
Right.

14:24.287 --> 14:27.313
And eternally fat!

14:27.390 --> 14:32.055
Oh, clever little witch.
She sent seating assignments.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.898
I find it very hard
to believe...

14:35.966 --> 14:39.834
that he got up early
and made his side of the bed.

14:39.904 --> 14:44.238
- No, madam.
- So where did he sleep?

14:44.308 --> 14:46.401
Again?

14:48.779 --> 14:52.739
The beaver has always
been of interest to man.

14:54.886 --> 14:58.117
It is the second largest
rodent in the world.

15:04.763 --> 15:07.493
Dr. Menville?

15:07.565 --> 15:11.900
Dr. Menville?

15:14.440 --> 15:17.204
Is this an angel
I see before me?

15:17.276 --> 15:21.872
- Dr. Menville, you're so cute.
- Thank you, Rose.

15:27.219 --> 15:30.712
Oh!

15:30.791 --> 15:34.352
More vodka.

15:34.428 --> 15:36.828
An outstanding characteristic
of a beaver...

15:36.897 --> 15:41.925
is the large, flat tail.

15:47.975 --> 15:51.036
- Is it up yet?
- Yes, sir.

15:51.112 --> 15:53.910
It's in the bath.

15:53.982 --> 15:58.578
Your beeper was beeping.
It's Mr. Franklin again.

16:09.397 --> 16:11.992
Rose!
Oh, it's you.

16:12.067 --> 16:14.763
Fine, dear, thank you.
Like a rock.

16:14.837 --> 16:16.964
You're dressed.
Special occasion?

16:17.039 --> 16:18.973
- Work.
- Ghoul!

16:19.041 --> 16:22.033
Dr. Menville,
thank God.

16:22.111 --> 16:25.774
- I'm sorry to call at the last minute.
- Yes.

16:25.848 --> 16:30.309
He's completely prepped. Our top staff
have been summoned and are waiting.

16:30.387 --> 16:32.821
Good, I'm sure he'll be fine.
Just calm down.

16:32.889 --> 16:36.222
Calm? I am calm.
Everyone is calm here.

16:36.292 --> 16:38.817
- Who is it?
- Fernando Rivas, the actor.

16:38.895 --> 16:43.127
He drowned in his hot tub.
Very bloated, very swollen.

16:43.199 --> 16:46.327
He was making love
to his new fiancee.

16:46.403 --> 16:49.531
Eighteen years old, from Cuba.

16:49.606 --> 16:52.371
He's got this expression of happiness
that is completely inappropriate.

16:52.443 --> 16:56.675
Thank you, Mr. Franklin, we'll see if
we can't give him a little character,

16:56.747 --> 16:59.409
- a little depth.
- Depth?

16:59.483 --> 17:04.011
Oh, no, Dr. Menville, you can't
give him any character or depth.

17:04.088 --> 17:07.147
People have to recognize him.

17:07.223 --> 17:11.093
- Good afternoon, Miss Ashton.
- 3:00 with Anna.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.222
Yes, I know.
You may go down.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.473
Miss Ashton, how are you?
So good to see you!

17:23.541 --> 17:27.603
Listen, I've got a really
important party tonight.

17:27.679 --> 17:30.945
Really important.
You understand?

17:31.017 --> 17:34.612
You will be the best one!

17:34.687 --> 17:37.315
I have to be better than that.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.517
I am sorry,
but the plasma separation...

17:39.592 --> 17:42.220
is a very traumatic
process to the body!

17:42.295 --> 17:44.786
Our policy clearly prohibits...

17:44.864 --> 17:47.833
more than one
in a six-month period.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.426
So? It's been nearly
that long already.

17:50.504 --> 17:54.964
Miss Ashton, you had one
three weeks ago.

17:55.042 --> 17:58.603
- How about a nice collagen buff?
- "A collagen buff"?

17:58.679 --> 18:01.910
You might as well ask me
to wash with soap and water!

18:03.884 --> 18:06.785
Tonight is
very important to me.

18:06.854 --> 18:10.723
- I could do your makeup myself.
- Makeup is pointless!

18:10.792 --> 18:13.488
It does nothing anymore.

18:13.561 --> 18:15.825
Are you listening to me?
Do you even care?

18:15.897 --> 18:19.196
You stand there with your 22-year-old
skin and your tits like rocks...

18:19.267 --> 18:22.134
and laugh at me.

18:28.776 --> 18:31.007
Mmm.

18:31.080 --> 18:35.414
I could pay you extra.

18:35.484 --> 18:39.181
Something...
on a personal basis.

18:39.255 --> 18:42.088
You know what I mean?
How about that?

18:42.158 --> 18:45.127
Money is no object.
It means nothing to me.

18:45.194 --> 18:47.628
Ahem.

18:47.696 --> 18:51.428
I'm sorry, Mr. Chagall.
I'm really, really sorry.

18:51.501 --> 18:54.334
Anna, don't talk, just go away.

18:54.404 --> 18:56.838
Leave us alone, mmm?

18:56.907 --> 19:00.035
- I don't want to look at you anymore.
- Oh, okay.

19:00.110 --> 19:02.237
Thank you so much.

19:04.147 --> 19:06.775
Please.

19:08.485 --> 19:11.353
- I suppose I should apologize.
- Oh, no, no.

19:11.422 --> 19:16.086
I am very sensitive
to your torment.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.459
- Excuse me?
- But unfortunately we are mere mortals.

19:19.530 --> 19:24.900
We are restricted by the...
laws of nature.

19:24.969 --> 19:27.995
Well, what more
could one expect?

19:28.072 --> 19:30.974
Mmm, mmm, that depends.

19:31.043 --> 19:36.481
I could not help but overhear your
little joke about money being no object.

19:36.548 --> 19:39.449
- That was no joke!
- I see.

19:41.820 --> 19:44.186
I wonder, Miss Ashton,

19:44.256 --> 19:48.352
if perhaps you have
ever heard of...

19:50.530 --> 19:52.498
Lisle Von Rhuman?

19:52.565 --> 19:55.125
Ah... no.

19:55.201 --> 19:58.136
No, of course you haven't.
Very few have.

19:58.204 --> 20:00.331
Only a select group.

20:00.406 --> 20:03.307
She may be able to help you.

20:04.644 --> 20:08.205
Here is her address.

20:08.281 --> 20:10.682
She accepts callers day...
and night.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.184
Eh...

20:12.253 --> 20:16.553
It is a very, very select group,
you understand?

20:16.624 --> 20:19.058
Sure.

20:21.462 --> 20:25.330
I'm glad this happened,
Miss Ashton.

20:25.399 --> 20:29.733
We shall be seeing
more of you, I think.

20:29.803 --> 20:31.897
Yes, I think so.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.681
Weirdo.

20:47.755 --> 20:50.782
Could you just not breathe?

21:00.702 --> 21:03.865
Jesus, what'd she do?
Hire extras?

21:03.939 --> 21:05.907
Good evening.

21:08.610 --> 21:11.546
Evian, please.
No ice.

21:12.782 --> 21:15.182
- Dr. Menville?
- Yes.

21:15.251 --> 21:18.118
- Ernest Menville?
- Yes.

21:18.187 --> 21:22.453
- Hi, I'm Vivian Adams.
- Hi, h-h-have we met?

21:22.525 --> 21:24.959
Long ago. I never had
a chance to thank you...

21:25.027 --> 21:30.227
for the spectacular job
you did with my Aunt Esther.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.734
Oh, well, thank you very much.

21:32.803 --> 21:35.533
Her color, her tone.

21:35.606 --> 21:39.633
- You even brought out her cheekbones.
- Well, that's my job.

21:39.710 --> 21:42.406
It was almost a shame
to bury her.

21:42.479 --> 21:44.743
It's so sweet of you
to say that.

21:44.815 --> 21:47.716
Can I ask you
what your secret is?

21:47.784 --> 21:49.911
Spray paint.

21:51.289 --> 21:55.885
You see, you can't just use
regular makeup on dead skin.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.894
The pores are too dry.

21:57.962 --> 22:00.954
You've gotta use a palette
and grind the stuff in.

22:01.032 --> 22:04.468
One day I'm in the hardware store and
I think, "What about mannequin paint?"

22:04.536 --> 22:09.371
It's got its own chemical adhesive,
comes in a variety of flesh--

22:10.709 --> 22:13.371
Excuse me!

22:29.295 --> 22:31.491
Have you seen her yet?

22:31.565 --> 22:35.729
What a joke. She's not even here.

22:37.470 --> 22:41.600
- Oh, look over there.
- Wh--

22:41.675 --> 22:46.305
Oh, looks as though
she's lost a few pounds!

22:52.019 --> 22:55.250
- We're leaving.
- Nonsense. Let's go talk to her.

22:55.323 --> 22:59.487
No. I'll talk to her.

23:00.962 --> 23:05.558
I just want you to know
that I am at your disposal.

23:05.633 --> 23:08.966
You can call me day or night.

23:09.036 --> 23:11.699
I did give you all my numbers?

23:25.120 --> 23:26.451
Mad?

23:26.521 --> 23:29.354
Hel!

23:35.498 --> 23:38.990
I don't believe it!

23:39.068 --> 23:44.370
Helen, darling, 12 years!
12 long years!

23:44.440 --> 23:47.807
And look at you,
you have a... waist.

23:47.877 --> 23:51.041
Oh, you haven't changed.

23:51.115 --> 23:54.243
Gosh, I'm glad you came.
I didn't know if you would.

23:54.318 --> 23:56.786
I spoke to my P.R. woman
and she said,

23:56.854 --> 23:59.789
"Madeline Ashton goes
to the opening of an envelope."

23:59.857 --> 24:02.621
Those people can be so cruel.

24:02.693 --> 24:05.992
I fired her.
Well, I almost fired her.

24:06.063 --> 24:08.361
Well, that was
sweet of you, dear.

24:08.432 --> 24:10.492
- Would you mind?
- Not at all.

24:10.568 --> 24:15.198
- So, how's it been?
- Heaven, it's absolute heaven.

24:15.273 --> 24:18.208
- Ernest is a dream.
- I'm so happy for you both.

24:18.276 --> 24:21.143
I often thought to myself
"I don't deserve this"...

24:21.212 --> 24:24.306
because it came
at your expense.

24:24.382 --> 24:27.943
And that thought
made me feel... terrible.

24:28.019 --> 24:31.285
Listen, that was a long time ago.

24:31.357 --> 24:35.623
You didn't steal him.
He went to you.

24:35.695 --> 24:38.789
It wasn't you.
It was him.

24:38.864 --> 24:41.765
I want you to know something.

24:41.834 --> 24:47.295
I have never ever blamed you.
Never!

24:55.816 --> 25:00.150
- Do you believe how she looks?
- How old is she?

25:00.220 --> 25:02.848
- Fifty.
- Fifty?

25:02.923 --> 25:05.323
You've gotta be kidding.

25:05.392 --> 25:08.919
I wonder what her secret is.

25:31.053 --> 25:35.683
- Life has turned out as quite a party.
- You used to hate parties.

25:35.758 --> 25:38.955
That was when I was old.
You should see me now.

25:39.027 --> 25:42.428
I didn't know
you were so unhappy.

25:46.268 --> 25:48.759
Never could lie to you.

25:51.007 --> 25:55.410
I know about the kind of...
work you're doing now.

25:55.478 --> 25:57.639
It's not work.

25:57.714 --> 26:01.878
I would sell my soul
to be able to operate again.

26:01.951 --> 26:06.445
- Oh, Helen, I've wasted my life.
- No, Ernest.

26:06.523 --> 26:09.356
She's wasted you.

26:09.425 --> 26:12.418
She married
a brilliant surgeon...

26:12.496 --> 26:15.294
and turned him
into an undertaker.

26:15.366 --> 26:18.301
I want you to know something.

26:18.369 --> 26:21.998
I have never blamed you
for leaving me.

26:22.072 --> 26:25.235
I always knew it was her.

26:25.309 --> 26:28.176
She's a woman.

26:28.245 --> 26:31.875
A woman, Ernest.

26:31.950 --> 26:34.248
From Newark, for God's sakes.

26:34.319 --> 26:39.655
I will never forgive her
for what she's done to you.

26:41.359 --> 26:43.384
Never.

27:15.596 --> 27:17.962
Dakota!

27:18.031 --> 27:20.591
Oh!

27:20.667 --> 27:22.601
Oh!

27:25.005 --> 27:26.836
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

27:26.907 --> 27:28.966
I didn't know
you were coming over.

27:29.042 --> 27:31.603
- Oh, my God, you're not alone.
- Of course I am.

27:31.679 --> 27:34.477
- I'm completely alone.
- Dakota?

27:34.549 --> 27:37.712
Actually, completely
isn't quite what I meant.

27:37.785 --> 27:41.551
- How dare you make me feel cheap!
- Madeline, I forgot.

27:41.623 --> 27:44.615
- She's here to-- She's here to fix--
- Who is she?

27:44.692 --> 27:47.559
- I'm trying to tell you--
- Who is the little piece of meat?

27:47.629 --> 27:50.895
She's a friend of, of,
the guy who was here to--

27:50.966 --> 27:54.902
- Jesus, at least lie quickly!
- I am trying to.

27:54.970 --> 28:00.636
Look, you gotta believe me.
This is perfectly innocent.

28:14.624 --> 28:16.592
Hey, hey, hey.

28:16.660 --> 28:18.992
I'm sick of this shit,
you know that?

28:19.062 --> 28:21.724
- I am doing you a favor here.
- Doing me a favor?

28:21.798 --> 28:25.097
- I gave you--
- Yeah, you gave, I gave. Big deal!

28:25.168 --> 28:27.864
Somebody told me we look
ridiculous together.

28:27.938 --> 28:30.373
How do you think
that makes me feel?

28:30.441 --> 28:32.773
You never think
about my feelings.

28:32.843 --> 28:36.210
Go find someone
your own age, Madeline!

29:42.249 --> 29:46.049
Madeline! I need to speak
to Madeline at once!

29:47.187 --> 29:49.417
No.

29:52.494 --> 29:56.760
Madeline. I need to speak
to Madeline at once!

29:56.831 --> 29:58.890
Yeah.

30:39.142 --> 30:41.667
Geez.

31:00.097 --> 31:03.726
- Good evening. I hope it's not too--
- Not at all, Miss Ashton.

31:03.801 --> 31:06.497
Miss Von Rhuman's expecting you.

31:06.571 --> 31:09.768
She is?

31:18.350 --> 31:21.012
Wait here, please.

31:47.313 --> 31:50.306
Follow me, please.

32:18.446 --> 32:21.506
Excuse me.

32:23.351 --> 32:26.081
I hoped you'd come.

32:26.154 --> 32:30.558
Make some room for my friend,
for Christ's sake!

32:30.626 --> 32:35.256
But...

32:35.331 --> 32:37.856
keep your ass handy.

32:46.575 --> 32:51.980
May I say that
I've always thought yours...

32:52.049 --> 32:57.009
to be one of the most
beautiful faces...

32:57.087 --> 33:00.614
ever to grace
the silver screen.

33:00.691 --> 33:01.953
Oh.

33:02.025 --> 33:04.220
And that husband of yours,

33:04.294 --> 33:08.355
I can only say that
his reputation is unsurpassed.

33:08.432 --> 33:10.367
Oh.

33:10.435 --> 33:14.963
I just arrived in town.
I follow the spring.

33:15.039 --> 33:17.439
I haven't seen an autumn
or winter in years.

33:20.378 --> 33:22.938
We are creatures
of the spring, you and I.

33:23.014 --> 33:27.610
Uh-huh. I'm not really
quite sure why I came.

33:27.685 --> 33:31.019
You're scared as hell...
of yourself,

33:32.157 --> 33:35.820
of the body you thought
you once knew.

33:35.894 --> 33:38.419
I beg your pardon?

33:39.531 --> 33:43.023
I am the one who understands.

33:43.102 --> 33:46.902
I am the one
who knows your secret.

33:49.108 --> 33:51.270
Who is it?

33:54.514 --> 33:58.006
Madeline.
I need to speak to Madeline.

33:58.084 --> 34:00.314
She's not here.

34:00.386 --> 34:03.549
Ah, thank God!

34:08.094 --> 34:11.963
How did you get in?
I didn't hear the gate.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.831
I didn't want you to hear.

34:16.904 --> 34:19.031
Ernest, ask me to go.

34:19.106 --> 34:21.973
Ask me to leave
this house immediately!

34:22.042 --> 34:24.840
- You just got here.
- I know, I know.

34:24.911 --> 34:28.541
But it just took me a glimpse
and I was back where I started.

34:28.616 --> 34:30.880
Where's that?

34:30.952 --> 34:34.284
- Don't pretend you're not aware of it.
- Of what?

34:34.356 --> 34:38.759
You're a powerful
sexual being, Ernest.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.556
I am?

34:40.629 --> 34:42.426
Yes, you are.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.625
If I never told you before,
it's because...

34:45.699 --> 34:49.136
I wasn't the sort of girl
that could say the word...

34:49.204 --> 34:52.766
"sexual" without blushing.

34:55.545 --> 34:58.036
Well, I can now.

34:59.749 --> 35:02.775
Sexual.

35:03.519 --> 35:06.079
Sensual.

35:07.657 --> 35:09.818
Sexy.

35:11.261 --> 35:14.059
Sex.

35:14.131 --> 35:17.100
Sex.

35:17.167 --> 35:19.192
Sex!

35:23.040 --> 35:27.636
So warm, so full of life.

35:27.711 --> 35:31.876
And already
it ebbs away from you.

35:31.950 --> 35:35.078
This is life's
ultimate cruelty.

35:35.153 --> 35:38.816
It offers us the taste
of youth and vitality...

35:38.890 --> 35:42.917
and then makes us
witness our own decay.

35:44.262 --> 35:46.594
Well, it is the natural law.

35:46.664 --> 35:49.132
Screw the natural law!

36:42.723 --> 36:45.248
What is that?

36:45.326 --> 36:49.558
What you came for.

36:49.630 --> 36:52.623
A touch of magic...

36:52.701 --> 36:57.001
in this world
obsessed with science.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.274
A tonic.

37:02.911 --> 37:05.209
A potion.

37:06.949 --> 37:08.917
What does it do?

37:08.984 --> 37:12.477
How old would you guess I am?

37:15.391 --> 37:18.485
I wouldn't--

37:18.561 --> 37:21.325
Come on.
Don't try to flatter me.

37:21.397 --> 37:23.888
Thirty eight.

37:24.934 --> 37:26.993
Oh, twenty eight.
Twenty... three?

37:27.070 --> 37:30.768
I am seventy-one years old.

37:30.841 --> 37:34.174
That's what it does.

37:34.244 --> 37:37.702
It stops the aging process
dead in its tracks...

37:37.781 --> 37:40.011
and forces it into retreat.

37:40.084 --> 37:44.851
Drink that potion and you'll
never grow even one day older.

37:44.922 --> 37:50.259
Don't drink it... and continue
to watch yourself rot.

37:51.162 --> 37:53.096
How much is it?

37:55.667 --> 37:59.603
The sordid topic of coin...

37:59.671 --> 38:02.401
I'm afraid is not so simple.

38:02.474 --> 38:06.843
The cost, you see,
it's different for everyone.

38:06.911 --> 38:10.211
Well, for me, how much?

38:25.464 --> 38:30.596
Well, thank you very much.
I think I should be going.

38:30.670 --> 38:32.900
Sit!

38:47.854 --> 38:50.653
Hold out your hand.

38:54.362 --> 38:57.964
What are you, nuts?

38:58.098 --> 39:00.191
Watch.

39:26.994 --> 39:29.428
Check okay?

39:29.497 --> 39:31.432
Fine.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.128
But you must make me a promise.

39:34.203 --> 39:37.070
The secret that we share
must never become public.

39:37.139 --> 39:39.767
You may continue your career
for ten years,

39:39.842 --> 39:43.073
ten years of perfect,
unchanged beauty.

39:43.145 --> 39:47.844
But at the end of that time,
before people become suspicious,

39:47.916 --> 39:50.818
you have to disappear
from public view forever.

39:50.887 --> 39:53.082
You can retire.

39:53.156 --> 39:56.387
You can stage
your own phony death...

39:56.459 --> 39:59.019
or...

39:59.095 --> 40:02.622
as one of my clients
simply said,

40:02.699 --> 40:05.600
"I vant to be alone, yah."

40:05.668 --> 40:08.603
No! She's not!

40:09.773 --> 40:11.708
Wow!

40:38.003 --> 40:40.597
Bottoms up.

40:53.719 --> 40:57.815
- Now, a warning.
- Now, a warning?

40:57.890 --> 41:01.382
Take care of yourself.

41:01.461 --> 41:07.229
You and your body are going
to be together a long time.

41:07.300 --> 41:09.996
Be good to it.

41:11.705 --> 41:15.607
Siempre viva.
Live forever.

41:56.619 --> 42:00.749
I can't believe--
Did you--

42:00.823 --> 42:03.621
Oh... I'm a girl!

42:03.692 --> 42:06.991
Shh.

42:07.062 --> 42:10.396
Ernest, oh, we gotta stop.

42:10.467 --> 42:12.958
I know we-- I know we--

42:13.036 --> 42:15.402
Really, Ernest. Oh.

42:15.472 --> 42:17.963
Ernest, don't be angry with me.

42:18.041 --> 42:21.408
I'm fighting this as hard
as I can, but just--

42:21.478 --> 42:23.139
Look at you!

42:25.582 --> 42:28.346
She's already destroyed
your career.

42:28.418 --> 42:31.013
Now she's breaking your heart,

42:31.088 --> 42:33.818
stealing your pride,

42:33.891 --> 42:36.257
flaunting her lovers...

42:36.327 --> 42:39.694
- all over town.
- You know about that?

42:39.764 --> 42:43.359
Everyone does.

42:43.434 --> 42:47.029
At the party,
people spoke of nothing else.

42:47.104 --> 42:49.902
How can you love me, Helen?

42:49.974 --> 42:54.344
I've been so weak for so long.

42:54.413 --> 42:58.042
I should've divorced Madeline
a long time ago.

43:00.385 --> 43:04.344
By God, that is exactly
what I am going to do!

43:04.423 --> 43:06.618
The first thing
tomorrow morning,

43:06.692 --> 43:10.128
I am gonna go downtown and obtain
a divorce from Madeline Ashton.

43:10.196 --> 43:14.132
- Ernest?
- Monday. At the very least Tuesday.

43:14.200 --> 43:18.034
Divorce?
In California?

43:18.104 --> 43:22.006
That's exactly what
she wants you to do.

43:22.075 --> 43:24.407
You have no talent for poverty.

43:30.818 --> 43:33.582
You can't let her
get away with that.

43:35.055 --> 43:38.081
Then there's nothing I can do.

43:39.960 --> 43:42.588
Oh, yes, there is.

43:46.767 --> 43:49.201
Listen to me, Ernest.

43:49.269 --> 43:53.832
I've thought this through
carefully, and it's the only way.

43:53.908 --> 43:57.639
Tonight, while she's asleep,
you'll sneak downstairs quietly,

43:57.712 --> 44:02.376
and take one of each kind
of wine glass from the shelf.

44:02.450 --> 44:04.884
Then you'll take
this Narconal...

44:04.953 --> 44:07.353
and lightly coat each glass.

44:07.422 --> 44:11.484
As you know, Narconal is a very
powerful alcohol-base tranquilizer,

44:11.560 --> 44:13.528
so you won't need much.

44:13.596 --> 44:16.258
Tomorrow, I'll call Madeline
to say good-bye.

44:16.332 --> 44:21.269
- I'll get her to invite me to dinner.
- Why don't you come to dinner?

44:21.337 --> 44:25.330
Then, at dinner,
we propose a toast.

44:25.408 --> 44:27.672
No matter which glass
she drinks from,

44:27.743 --> 44:31.908
Narconal will be on the glass.

44:31.982 --> 44:35.418
You and I work together.
First, we finish dinner.

44:35.485 --> 44:38.852
Then we load her in the car, take
her to the top of Mulholland Drive,

44:38.922 --> 44:44.087
call the police and report we've seen a
drunk woman swerving close to the edge.

44:44.161 --> 44:47.722
Some drunk woman up here on Mulholland's
swerving dangerously close to the edge.

44:47.798 --> 44:51.462
We'll sit her up
in the driver's seat...

44:51.536 --> 44:53.401
and make it look like
she's had...

44:53.471 --> 44:57.430
just a little bit
too much to drink.

44:57.508 --> 44:59.738
We drop the car into gear,

45:01.479 --> 45:04.312
wedge her foot
down on the accelerator,

45:05.883 --> 45:08.909
clamp her hands
on the steering wheel...

45:08.986 --> 45:11.888
and send her on her way.

45:22.835 --> 45:25.736
By the time
they perform the autopsy,

45:25.804 --> 45:28.466
the Narconal will be
completely dissolved,

45:28.540 --> 45:31.305
leaving only traces of alcohol.

45:31.377 --> 45:35.814
She'll be classified
as just another drunk driver.

45:35.882 --> 45:41.411
- They'll check her blood alcohol...
- Point four-0. She had it coming.

45:41.488 --> 45:43.956
And think nothing more of it.

45:44.023 --> 45:48.722
The case is closed.
Madeline is dead.

45:48.795 --> 45:52.357
And we're free!

45:52.433 --> 45:55.231
What are we saying?

46:01.575 --> 46:05.511
- We can't go through with this, Helen.
- It's the only way.

46:05.579 --> 46:07.843
After she's gone,

46:07.915 --> 46:11.249
you can start your life
all over again.

46:11.319 --> 46:14.652
I can start my life
all over again.

46:14.723 --> 46:19.160
Oh, we'll be so happy!

46:21.797 --> 46:24.925
She's killing you.

46:26.668 --> 46:30.571
So... it would be
self-defense.

46:30.640 --> 46:34.132
Self-defense.

48:04.971 --> 48:08.429
My God, it's back!

48:17.985 --> 48:20.249
We have to talk.

48:20.321 --> 48:23.688
- Have another drink and go to bed.
- You'd like that.

48:23.758 --> 48:26.921
You'd like to see me drink
myself into an early grave.

48:26.994 --> 48:29.394
That is not going
to happen, by God!

48:29.463 --> 48:33.730
- You are not going to take my money!
- What are you talking about?

48:33.802 --> 48:37.033
When was the last time you
worked, Madeline? A real job?

48:37.105 --> 48:41.474
Anything you had left, you owed me
a long time ago. Your face owed me.

48:41.543 --> 48:44.034
You've changed your hair?

48:46.381 --> 48:48.474
What an eye.

48:48.550 --> 48:50.485
Don't wait up.

48:52.722 --> 48:55.020
Cheap.

48:57.927 --> 49:00.361
What did you say?

49:00.430 --> 49:02.898
I called you cheap.
That's what I think of you.

49:02.965 --> 49:05.433
Who do you think
you're talking to?

49:05.501 --> 49:08.163
You're a cheap,
tacky little tramp.

49:08.237 --> 49:10.536
Who do you think you are?

49:10.607 --> 49:14.008
- Nothing like the woman I married.
- You're nothing!

49:14.078 --> 49:17.570
- You're a broad!
- You're a tragic, boozy, flaccid clown.

49:17.648 --> 49:21.482
- Watch it, Madeline.
- That's it. Flaccid.

49:21.552 --> 49:23.577
- Watch what you say.
- Flaccid.

49:23.654 --> 49:26.248
I don't have to take
this any longer!

49:26.323 --> 49:29.224
You'll take everything I have to give!
You always have.

49:29.293 --> 49:31.728
You're not even a man anymore.
And I need a man!

49:31.796 --> 49:35.926
A real man, not some drunken,
broken-down flaccid undertaker...

49:36.000 --> 49:39.163
who is just as dead below
the waist as his clients are.

49:39.237 --> 49:42.001
Hey, I might have more fun
with one of your clients!

49:42.073 --> 49:45.509
At least I'd know I'd be
getting something stiff--

50:02.461 --> 50:05.430
Did you think that I was just going
to take it forever, Madeline?

50:05.498 --> 50:06.988
Did you?

50:07.066 --> 50:10.264
You cruel, vicious,
loathsome bitch!

50:14.741 --> 50:17.972
Please? Please?

50:20.647 --> 50:23.810
Oh, God! Oh!

50:23.884 --> 50:27.911
- Madeline, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, help me! Help me!

50:30.491 --> 50:32.789
Hurry!

50:32.860 --> 50:35.021
Help me!
Hurry up, you wimp!

50:59.087 --> 51:01.078
Oh, boy.

51:07.329 --> 51:10.993
Oh, oh.

51:11.067 --> 51:13.934
Oh.

51:15.705 --> 51:18.697
Oh, boy!

51:45.903 --> 51:48.269
Oh, boy!

51:59.084 --> 52:01.279
Suite 1110, please.

52:01.353 --> 52:04.186
Helen, it's me, Ernest Menville!
I did it!

52:04.256 --> 52:06.554
I didn't think I'd be able to,
but I did it!

52:06.625 --> 52:09.753
I pushed her down the stairs.
She is absolutely stone cold.

52:09.828 --> 52:13.287
She was saying the most
monstrous things and she's dead.

52:13.366 --> 52:15.960
I just had this feeling inside
of me that I couldn't contain.

52:16.035 --> 52:18.765
We're free, Helen. But I'm
afraid I'm gonna burn in hell.

52:18.838 --> 52:21.705
Her neck is broken and
there's no pulse and she's dead.

52:21.774 --> 52:25.403
Exactly which part of the plan
were you unclear on?

52:25.478 --> 52:29.039
- We went over it three times, Ernest.
- You don't understand.

52:29.115 --> 52:32.950
- Ernest, we went over it three times.
- You don't understand.

52:33.020 --> 52:35.284
It just happened.
It was an accident.

52:35.355 --> 52:37.653
It's better than an accident. At least
it's gonna look like an accident.

52:37.724 --> 52:40.056
- Have you called the police?
- No, I called you first.

52:40.127 --> 52:43.528
Ernest, you...
poor, sweet thing.

52:43.597 --> 52:48.057
If the police check the phone records,
don't you think it'll look unusual...

52:48.135 --> 52:52.266
- that you called me before them?
- Oh, my God.

52:52.340 --> 52:54.831
- You're right.
- Of course I'm right!

52:54.909 --> 52:56.843
- Should I call them right now?
- No.

52:56.911 --> 53:00.506
We have to decide what
you're going to say first.

53:01.749 --> 53:04.274
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

53:05.453 --> 53:07.580
Okay, I've got it.
Where's the body?

53:07.655 --> 53:11.422
- At the foot of the stairs.
- Good. Don't move her.

53:11.493 --> 53:14.018
- Soon as we hang up, call the police.
- Okay.

53:14.096 --> 53:17.827
Tell them you were on the phone with
me when you heard a terrible scream.

53:17.900 --> 53:20.869
You turned around and saw
Madeline fall down the stairs.

53:20.936 --> 53:23.029
- Right. Perfect.
- Stick to that story.

53:23.105 --> 53:26.268
If they check the phone records,
it'll confirm what you told them.

53:26.342 --> 53:29.106
- Got it.
- What about the time of death?

53:29.178 --> 53:32.808
- Could they prove the call came after?
- No, no.

53:32.882 --> 53:35.976
It's very difficult to determine
time of death within a few hours.

53:36.052 --> 53:39.818
- It's not an exact science.
- Ernest? Ernest!

53:39.889 --> 53:44.485
Ernest, you pushed me
down the stairs!

53:49.866 --> 53:52.301
Stay away from me!

53:52.370 --> 53:54.998
You bet I will!
Animal! Psycho!

53:55.072 --> 53:58.064
- Don't come near me.
- Wife pusher!

53:58.142 --> 54:02.806
Don't come near me,
follow me or talk to me.

54:02.880 --> 54:04.745
I don't intend to.

54:04.815 --> 54:07.716
I just have to make
a telephone call.

54:11.189 --> 54:15.057
I just have to make
a telephone call.

54:15.127 --> 54:17.288
9-1-1, right?

54:20.532 --> 54:24.366
You're in the shit
house now, pal!

54:25.404 --> 54:27.565
Madeline, look at yourself!

54:27.639 --> 54:30.507
- Huh?
- Look at yourself!

54:34.380 --> 54:36.678
Ernest!

54:36.749 --> 54:39.718
My ass!

54:39.786 --> 54:43.244
I can see...
my ass!

54:43.322 --> 54:48.282
- Something's wrong with your neck too.
- I would say so.

54:48.361 --> 54:53.095
I would friggin' well say so!

54:54.468 --> 54:57.528
Oh!
Are you okay, honey?

54:57.604 --> 55:00.402
Yeah. Oh.

55:04.178 --> 55:08.080
Ernest...

55:08.148 --> 55:10.447
what's wrong with me?

55:10.518 --> 55:13.749
It's a dislocated neck.
That's what it is.

55:13.822 --> 55:17.417
It could happen. I've never seen
it happen, but it could happen.

55:17.492 --> 55:20.928
Yeah, so? Fix it.

55:20.995 --> 55:23.793
- How?
- I don't know. Just do it!

55:23.865 --> 55:26.834
I wouldn't know where
to begin, Madeline.

55:26.901 --> 55:28.892
For God's sake!

55:34.777 --> 55:36.802
Ah!

55:36.879 --> 55:39.313
Oh!

55:43.886 --> 55:47.754
Honey, I think I need a doctor.

55:52.095 --> 55:55.365
- What's the matter with this guy?
- She's at death's door!

55:55.498 --> 55:57.363
Doctor, she's at death's door.

55:57.434 --> 56:00.460
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that?

56:00.537 --> 56:02.562
What seems to be the problem?

56:02.639 --> 56:05.073
I fell down the stairs.

56:05.141 --> 56:07.905
Whoopsie.
Anything broken?

56:07.977 --> 56:10.845
I don't think so. I mean,
it would hurt, wouldn't it?

56:10.915 --> 56:13.509
I should think so, yeah.

56:13.584 --> 56:18.021
Maybe my wrist,
but my neck feels sort of sore.

56:18.089 --> 56:20.649
Let's have a little look at you.
Which wrist is it?

56:20.725 --> 56:22.784
Right.

56:22.860 --> 56:25.658
- Does it hurt when I do this?
- No.

56:25.730 --> 56:28.722
- How about this?
- Nope.

56:30.736 --> 56:34.069
- Ah, okay, this?
-  Hmm, no, uh-uh.

56:35.073 --> 56:38.474
- This doesn't hurt?
- Uh-uh. No.

56:38.543 --> 56:41.376
Are you telling me
it doesn't hurt when I do this?

56:41.446 --> 56:44.108
It doesn't hurt.
I told you that.

56:44.182 --> 56:47.674
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

56:47.753 --> 56:51.019
Okay, what's this you're talking
about with your neck?

56:51.090 --> 56:54.423
It hurts when I kinda
turn it, you know?

56:54.494 --> 56:57.258
Maybe you just--

56:57.330 --> 57:01.061
Okay, right.
I see. Gotcha.

57:01.134 --> 57:05.400
- What about shock? Should we check?
- It could be shock.

57:05.471 --> 57:07.735
It could be shock.

57:22.523 --> 57:24.821
What is--

57:34.602 --> 57:36.866
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

57:36.938 --> 57:39.600
It's, uh, it's interesting.

57:39.674 --> 57:42.234
It's okeydokey.

57:42.310 --> 57:45.575
I think that
just about covers it.

57:45.647 --> 57:49.344
- Might I have a little sip of that?
- Of course.

57:51.754 --> 57:55.520
Well, I'll tell you what.
We, this, uh, odd thing.

57:55.591 --> 57:58.754
Your wrist,
as far as I can tell,

57:58.828 --> 58:02.229
it's fractured in three places.

58:02.298 --> 58:04.732
And you've shattered,
uh, two, uh, vertebrae.

58:04.800 --> 58:08.327
I can't really be certain
without an X ray.

58:08.404 --> 58:13.104
But the bone protrusion through
the skin, that's not a good sign.

58:13.176 --> 58:15.872
And, uh... your body temperature
is below 80...

58:15.946 --> 58:19.006
and, your, your, your...

58:19.082 --> 58:21.380
your heart's stopped beating.

58:21.451 --> 58:24.852
What the hell does that mean?

58:24.921 --> 58:27.287
Exactly! Exactly what--

58:27.357 --> 58:30.623
I think...
I'm gonna get a second opinion.

58:30.695 --> 58:32.458
Doctor?

58:32.530 --> 58:35.260
Well, could be worse.

58:35.333 --> 58:38.200
- I'm gonna examine you myself.
- No.

58:38.269 --> 58:40.533
- Sit still.
- Don't touch me.

58:40.605 --> 58:44.564
- My God, he's right.
- He is not right. Don't be ridiculous.

58:44.642 --> 58:46.735
- This is incredible.
- What would it mean if he were right?

58:46.811 --> 58:51.340
You're in violation of every
natural law that I know.

58:51.416 --> 58:53.441
I, I, I, I violated what law?

58:53.519 --> 58:55.612
In violation of every
natural law that I know!

58:55.687 --> 59:00.522
You're sitting there, you're
talking to me, but you're dead!

59:00.592 --> 59:02.787
I'm gonna get help!

59:08.299 --> 59:10.700
I need a doctor!
Room 147!

59:10.769 --> 59:15.138
Hey! Hey!

59:15.207 --> 59:20.804
Respiratory therapist
to E.R. Therapist to the E.R.

59:20.879 --> 59:24.576
Where are all the doctors?

59:30.457 --> 59:33.221
No, no, no!
Not that lab!

59:33.293 --> 59:36.262
Everyone clear.

59:36.329 --> 59:39.423
- What do we have now?
- No pulse!

59:45.739 --> 59:48.640
Where is she?

59:53.114 --> 59:56.140
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I know how difficult this must be.

59:56.217 --> 59:58.947
You don't understand.
She didn't--

59:59.019 --> 01:00:01.146
This is very hard to explain.

01:00:01.222 --> 01:00:04.157
I know it is.
How can anyone explain it?

01:00:04.225 --> 01:00:07.353
- Where did you put my wife?
- Don't worry about that now.

01:00:07.428 --> 01:00:09.828
Just give yourself
some time to grieve.

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:14.164
- Where did you put my wife?
- She's dead. She's in the morgue.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:18.036
The morgue!
She'll be furious.

01:01:26.978 --> 01:01:30.346
- Help!
- Yes, it's me, darling.

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:33.715
Oh, Ernest!

01:01:33.786 --> 01:01:37.916
I fainted and I woke up
and it was all dark.

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:40.788
I kept yelling
and yelling and yelling.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.658
Nobody heard me.
Nobody did anything.

01:01:43.729 --> 01:01:46.129
Then I didn't know where
I was and I got scared.

01:01:46.198 --> 01:01:49.690
It's okay.
It's all right.

01:01:49.768 --> 01:01:53.637
Ernest, I'm in the morgue.

01:01:53.707 --> 01:01:55.937
- Why am I in the morgue?
- Shh! It's okay. It's okay!

01:01:56.009 --> 01:01:58.443
Listen! I understand now.
It's incredible!

01:01:58.511 --> 01:02:01.571
It's physically impossible,
but now I understand it.

01:02:01.648 --> 01:02:05.744
- They think I'm dead, Ernest.
- Yes! But you're not!

01:02:05.819 --> 01:02:08.617
In the whole of recorded
medical history,

01:02:08.688 --> 01:02:11.920
this has never happened
to another single human.

01:02:11.993 --> 01:02:15.793
Yeah, so, why did it have
to happen to me?

01:02:15.863 --> 01:02:19.094
- Do you know what you are, darling?
- Uh-uh.

01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:23.296
You're a sign.
You're an omen, a burning bush!

01:02:23.371 --> 01:02:26.067
- I am?
- Of course you are.

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.007
We're being told that
we belong together.

01:02:29.076 --> 01:02:32.706
And I'm being called.
I'm being challenged.

01:02:32.781 --> 01:02:36.080
Don't you see, Madeline?
It's a miracle!

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:16.753
Oh, my God!

01:03:41.219 --> 01:03:45.280
Shit!

01:04:01.941 --> 01:04:03.909
Oh!

01:04:31.139 --> 01:04:33.266
Formaldehyde.

01:04:33.341 --> 01:04:36.606
What in God's name?

01:05:07.276 --> 01:05:09.244
Darn it.

01:05:14.517 --> 01:05:16.451
It's just not the right balance.

01:05:16.519 --> 01:05:19.545
- How's it goin', Ern?
- I don't wanna rush things, Madeline.

01:05:19.622 --> 01:05:23.251
Who keeps calling?

01:05:23.326 --> 01:05:25.794
- Huh?
- Who is that?

01:05:25.862 --> 01:05:28.922
I can't have these interruptions!

01:05:31.735 --> 01:05:35.398
I'm gonna need you
to hold very still.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.941
Oh!

01:05:38.008 --> 01:05:41.273
- What?
- Madeline!

01:05:41.345 --> 01:05:44.746
- I asked you to sit still.
- Mmm, what's the matter?

01:05:44.815 --> 01:05:47.807
- I need more turpentine now.
- Are we almost done?

01:05:47.885 --> 01:05:51.447
The highlights of your eyes are
unbalanced. Want people to stare?

01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:56.323
I can't use kerosene
because it'll affect the skin.

01:05:58.497 --> 01:06:01.864
Where is she?

01:06:05.237 --> 01:06:09.264
Oh, my gosh, Helen!
What are you doin' here?

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:11.833
What's that on your hands?
Blood?

01:06:11.911 --> 01:06:14.106
- Paint!
- Paint?

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.148
What would you be doing that
you have paint on your hands?

01:06:16.215 --> 01:06:18.581
- Painting.
- Ernest.

01:06:18.651 --> 01:06:21.814
Are you doing something funny
with Madeline?

01:06:21.888 --> 01:06:25.221
- Define funny.
- Oh, come on, Ernest. Cough her up!

01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:27.589
Shh, shh, shh, listen, Helen.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.026
- We should go outside and talk.
- Why are you whispering?

01:06:30.096 --> 01:06:34.534
- She's resting and in a foul mood.
- Are you nuts?

01:06:34.601 --> 01:06:37.399
- She's resting!
- She's not resting.

01:06:37.471 --> 01:06:41.931
She's dead, Ernest, just like we
wanted, just like we plotted together.

01:06:42.009 --> 01:06:45.877
Remember? You may have done it
alone, but I can't walk away now.

01:06:45.946 --> 01:06:48.813
- Not after you put us both in jeopardy!
- Shh!

01:06:48.882 --> 01:06:53.377
We have to bury her in Death Valley
and be done with her once and for all.

01:06:53.454 --> 01:06:56.946
- You have to listen to me.
- Stop waffling. She deserved it.

01:06:57.025 --> 01:07:01.553
She was a home wrecker.
She was a man-eater.

01:07:01.629 --> 01:07:04.530
And she was a bad... actress.

01:07:04.599 --> 01:07:10.003
- Would you please listen to me!
- Oh, stop it!

01:07:10.071 --> 01:07:12.597
Madeline is not ready
to be buried yet.

01:07:12.675 --> 01:07:15.200
- She's upstairs resting peacefully.
- Oh, fine!

01:07:15.277 --> 01:07:17.507
If she's not dead,
you tell her to come here.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.048
Tell her to come here,
walk right up to me...

01:07:20.115 --> 01:07:22.675
- and kiss me on the--
- Kiss you on the what?

01:07:24.386 --> 01:07:28.982
- Mad?
- Hel.

01:07:29.058 --> 01:07:31.960
- Darling.
- What have you two...

01:07:32.028 --> 01:07:36.124
been plotting down here
or should I say, what else?

01:07:36.199 --> 01:07:41.432
Are you angry, dear?
Are you very angry?

01:07:41.504 --> 01:07:46.168
- It's alive.
- Madeline?

01:07:46.243 --> 01:07:50.647
Oh, boy! Helen, I think you
should leave right away.

01:07:50.715 --> 01:07:54.617
I see a very bad
situation developing here.

01:07:54.685 --> 01:07:58.280
Dear? Madeline?

01:08:08.232 --> 01:08:10.326
I just want you
to know one thing, Hel.

01:08:11.903 --> 01:08:13.837
You brought this on yourself.

01:08:13.905 --> 01:08:18.841
Madeline!

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:23.210
Oh, my God!

01:08:23.282 --> 01:08:27.479
- What have you done?
- What have I done? Defended myself.

01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:29.816
You plotter, coconspirator!

01:08:29.888 --> 01:08:33.256
- She's dead!
- She is?

01:08:33.326 --> 01:08:37.854
These are the moments
that make life worth living.

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:41.161
My God, Madeline, that was horrible.
It was brutal.

01:08:41.234 --> 01:08:44.260
It was stupid!
The police, Madeline! The police!

01:08:44.337 --> 01:08:47.363
What are they gonna do? Put me
in the gas chamber? Big deal.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:50.535
Life in prison? Know what that
means to a person in your condition?

01:08:50.611 --> 01:08:55.742
- So negative. Let me enjoy the moment.
- What about the neighbors?

01:08:55.816 --> 01:09:00.377
Neighbors? In 12 years in Los Angeles,
have you ever seen a neighbor?

01:09:00.453 --> 01:09:03.514
Oh! I gotta think!
I gotta think!

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:05.581
One of us has to stay rational.

01:09:05.658 --> 01:09:10.153
I am completely rational.
We're going to bury her.

01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:12.721
In Death Valley.
You and I.

01:09:12.801 --> 01:09:15.234
I most certainly will not!

01:09:15.303 --> 01:09:20.434
Oh, no? Pretty strong words
for a murderer on the run,

01:09:20.508 --> 01:09:24.000
which is exactly
what you are, Ernest.

01:09:26.247 --> 01:09:29.613
What if the police should receive an
anonymous phone call about you...

01:09:29.684 --> 01:09:34.486
and find me on the floor
not breathing, no pulse?

01:09:34.557 --> 01:09:37.890
Ain't nobody can play dead
like me, Ernest.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:42.863
What will you tell them? You're going
to be very popular in prison.

01:09:42.932 --> 01:09:45.832
- Prison?
- Prison.

01:09:45.901 --> 01:09:50.099
Do you know what they do to soft,
bald, overweight Republicans...

01:09:50.171 --> 01:09:53.609
in prison, Ernest?

01:09:53.676 --> 01:09:55.845
I'll get the shovels, dear.

01:10:00.483 --> 01:10:03.281
And she even paid
for the hardware.

01:10:03.352 --> 01:10:07.379
Don't you just love it?

01:10:07.456 --> 01:10:10.585
Oh!

01:10:11.928 --> 01:10:14.488
- Are you just gonna sit there?
- What?

01:10:14.564 --> 01:10:17.533
- I won't be your accomplice by myself.
- I'll help.

01:10:17.601 --> 01:10:20.001
- I'm happy to help.
- Help me stretch this out. Get the end.

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:23.938
- I'm very happy to help.
- Put the body right here.

01:10:24.007 --> 01:10:26.737
Today really shaped up
in a hurry, didn't it?

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:30.177
Did you ever notice how some days
can start out so shitty--

01:10:33.184 --> 01:10:36.312
and then suddenly something wonderful
happens and your whole outlook...

01:10:36.387 --> 01:10:41.757
just suddenly... changes.

01:10:41.826 --> 01:10:45.353
That... was totally
uncalled-for.

01:10:59.711 --> 01:11:04.842
Look at me, Ernest, just look at me.
I'm soaking wet.

01:11:04.917 --> 01:11:09.513
And there seems to be something
wrong with your, uh, blouse.

01:11:11.157 --> 01:11:15.287
I have a hole in my stomach!

01:11:15.361 --> 01:11:18.125
Oh!

01:11:18.198 --> 01:11:21.258
I have a hole in my stomach!

01:11:21.334 --> 01:11:25.498
Yeah, and you're still alive.

01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:29.372
- It's another miracle!
- No, it isn't.

01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:39.517
Ha! Ah-ha!
You took the potion!

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.782
- How do you know about that?
- Oh!

01:11:41.856 --> 01:11:45.519
- You took the potion too.
- Well, I hardly needed it.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:49.461
So that's why you look
the way you do and you are dead.

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:53.194
- When did you take it?
- October 26, 1985. Way before you!

01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:55.634
- What are you talking about?
-  The potion!

01:11:55.704 --> 01:11:57.672
- How much did you pay?
- Everything I had.

01:11:57.739 --> 01:11:59.798
- And that was cheap!
- You took a potion?

01:11:59.875 --> 01:12:03.811
- Beauty book, my butt!
- Wait a second.

01:12:03.879 --> 01:12:06.643
I don't think this is
a miracle at all!

01:12:06.715 --> 01:12:10.082
You're a fraud, a walking lie
and I can see right through you!

01:12:10.152 --> 01:12:15.420
Speaking of which,
as a friend, some advice.

01:12:15.491 --> 01:12:19.222
I would stay out of
a bathing suit for a while.

01:12:19.295 --> 01:12:21.661
At least, a two piece.

01:12:21.731 --> 01:12:23.926
Or if I--

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:37.779
Damn. I just fixed this.

01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:48.758
En garde.

01:12:48.825 --> 01:12:50.623
- Bitch.
- Girls, girls!

01:12:50.695 --> 01:12:55.632
Let's just calm down. I'm sure we can
settle this peacefully-- Whoa!

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:59.033
You should learn not to compete
with me. I always win.

01:12:59.103 --> 01:13:01.333
Yah! Yah!

01:13:01.406 --> 01:13:04.375
You may have always won,
but you never played fair.

01:13:04.442 --> 01:13:07.536
Oh!

01:13:07.612 --> 01:13:10.480
Who cares how I played?
I won!

01:13:10.549 --> 01:13:13.017
I'll just be upstairs.

01:13:13.085 --> 01:13:17.488
That's 'cause you could
raise your legs higher than anyone.

01:13:17.556 --> 01:13:22.186
But look at you now! You couldn't
raise an eyebrow without surgery!

01:13:22.261 --> 01:13:24.695
I've raised a lot more
than an eyebrow in my day.

01:13:24.763 --> 01:13:27.391
You skinny, phony,
hollow bitch!

01:13:27.466 --> 01:13:29.559
You've lost
your one and only talent.

01:13:29.635 --> 01:13:33.128
Which was one more talent
than you had, you former fatso!

01:13:38.511 --> 01:13:42.174
- Aaah!
- Yes! No! Oh, damn!

01:13:42.249 --> 01:13:45.343
This is pointless!
Wait a minute, this is ridiculous!

01:13:45.418 --> 01:13:47.682
We can't even hurt each other!
We can't even inflict pain!

01:13:47.754 --> 01:13:49.984
Pain!

01:13:50.056 --> 01:13:53.754
I'll tell ya about pain!
Bobby O'Brien!

01:13:53.828 --> 01:13:57.423
Scott Hunter! Ernest Menville!
That's pain!

01:13:57.498 --> 01:14:00.296
I loved every one of them
and they loved me.

01:14:00.368 --> 01:14:03.531
I will not speak to you till
you put your head on straight.

01:14:06.774 --> 01:14:09.299
They were all I had and
you took them away from me.

01:14:09.377 --> 01:14:12.108
Not because you loved them,
not because you cared...

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:14.910
but just to hurt me on purpose.

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.974
- That is not true!
- Liar!

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:19.646
- You attacked me first!
- Me?

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:22.451
Do you think I was blind, deaf?

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:27.552
I couldn't hear what you and your
snotty friends were saying about me?

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:32.033
- You thought I was cheap.
- Oh, please. You're insane.

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:35.559
Then how come you never invited me to
one of those parties at your parents?

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.869
Because we didn't think
you'd feel comfortable.

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:42.206
- It wasn't usual for-- Stop that!
- I'm trying.

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:46.339
- It wasn't usual for us to have--
- Trash in the house!

01:14:46.416 --> 01:14:49.681
You're avoiding the issue. You stole
my boyfriends to hurt me on purpose!

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:51.687
- I did not!
- Admit it!

01:14:51.755 --> 01:14:55.418
No, you admit it.
You look me in the eye...

01:14:55.492 --> 01:15:01.226
and you admit
you thought I was cheap.

01:15:13.845 --> 01:15:19.306
Okay, I thought you were cheap.

01:15:24.356 --> 01:15:28.122
Well,

01:15:28.193 --> 01:15:30.754
I hurt you on purpose.

01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:35.631
and I'm... really sorry.

01:15:38.504 --> 01:15:41.006
I'm sorry too.

01:15:44.376 --> 01:15:46.640
Ern, darling.

01:15:46.711 --> 01:15:50.705
Helen and I want to apologize
for that little thing downstairs.

01:15:50.783 --> 01:15:55.152
- We've got it out of our systems now.
- Yeah, thank God.

01:15:55.221 --> 01:15:58.554
It was so awful hating you
and envying you at the same time.

01:15:58.624 --> 01:16:00.956
You envied me?
I envied you!

01:16:01.027 --> 01:16:03.291
- You did not!
- I did too.

01:16:03.362 --> 01:16:06.024
- Specifically, what part did you envy?
- Your grade point for one.

01:16:06.098 --> 01:16:08.999
Excuse me. Excuse me!

01:16:11.505 --> 01:16:17.239
I just wanted to tell you both that
I've come to a decision that's...

01:16:17.311 --> 01:16:21.611
very important
and long overdue.

01:16:21.682 --> 01:16:24.116
- I'm leaving.
- You're what? Leaving? No.

01:16:24.184 --> 01:16:27.210
- We need you.
- I promised Hel you would fix her.

01:16:27.287 --> 01:16:29.619
And Maddie needs work too.

01:16:29.690 --> 01:16:34.185
- You can go first.
- Oh, that's so sweet of you!

01:16:34.262 --> 01:16:36.287
Thank you. Ern?

01:16:36.364 --> 01:16:41.461
Come on. What do you say?
For old times sake.

01:16:41.536 --> 01:16:43.561
Please!

01:16:47.508 --> 01:16:52.412
On one condition.
When I'm done, I go.

01:16:54.316 --> 01:16:58.116
You don't look for me.
You don't ask about me.

01:16:58.187 --> 01:17:00.178
You don't even think
about me ever again.

01:17:00.255 --> 01:17:04.589
I have no problem with that.
Do you?

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.993
Not anymore.

01:17:22.145 --> 01:17:24.841
- Oh!
- Oh! It's amazing!

01:17:24.914 --> 01:17:27.747
- Oh!
- Not a blemish! Not a pore!

01:17:27.817 --> 01:17:32.448
Oh! Say what you will about Ernest,
but the man is a genius.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.821
He is. He's a genius.

01:17:34.892 --> 01:17:37.725
- Wait. You've got a little thing.
- Ooh!

01:17:37.795 --> 01:17:40.263
Probably shouldn't have done that.
Ha-ha!

01:17:40.331 --> 01:17:42.822
- I think it's still... wet.
- Can Ernest fix this?

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.891
- Yeah, I'll get him before he leaves.
- But wait a minute.

01:17:44.969 --> 01:17:46.459
What if this happens again?

01:17:46.537 --> 01:17:49.005
What if it fades? Chips?
What if it rains?

01:17:49.073 --> 01:17:51.201
- Will he come back for touch-ups?
- Even if he does,

01:17:51.276 --> 01:17:53.267
he's not gonna live forever.

01:17:53.345 --> 01:17:56.143
- That's not good.
- What are we gonna do?

01:17:56.214 --> 01:17:58.682
- He'll have to take the potion.
- Yeah!

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:00.718
We'll take him to Lisle's.
She'll talk him into it.

01:18:00.786 --> 01:18:03.516
He won't go to Lisle's. You heard him.
He's made up his mind about leaving.

01:18:03.588 --> 01:18:07.080
That's true.
We have to respect that.

01:18:07.159 --> 01:18:10.687
I know. We'll drug him.

01:18:10.763 --> 01:18:13.323
Ern, darling.

01:18:13.399 --> 01:18:15.924
My taxi here?

01:18:16.002 --> 01:18:19.665
We thought you might
like some breakfast.

01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:27.338
You know, I was just thinking.

01:18:27.413 --> 01:18:30.975
I was questioning myself.
I was wondering why...

01:18:31.051 --> 01:18:33.815
I didn't pack this thing
five years ago,

01:18:33.887 --> 01:18:37.379
six years ago, ten years ago,
instead of sticking around here...

01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:41.451
and suffering
every indignity and humiliation.

01:18:41.528 --> 01:18:45.294
I'll tell ya why.
Because I made a promise...

01:18:45.365 --> 01:18:47.356
and that meant
everything to me.

01:18:47.434 --> 01:18:51.201
Yes, it's all very noble
to keep your word.

01:18:51.272 --> 01:18:53.638
Ernest? Your drink?

01:18:53.708 --> 01:18:57.007
Do you know what they call someone who
sticks by their word no matter what?

01:18:57.078 --> 01:19:00.138
- At the cost of all else? Do you know?
- No.

01:19:00.215 --> 01:19:04.242
An idiot. From now on I'm gonna be
the kind of idiot I wanna be.

01:19:04.319 --> 01:19:07.220
An idiot with a modicum of pride,
because you know what?

01:19:07.288 --> 01:19:10.952
I finally realized something.
I've lived up to my promise.

01:19:11.026 --> 01:19:14.462
Till death do us part.

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:18.694
Well, you girls are dead.

01:19:18.767 --> 01:19:21.759
And I'm parting.

01:19:21.837 --> 01:19:24.067
Cheers.

01:19:25.641 --> 01:19:28.337
You know something else?

01:19:32.616 --> 01:19:36.712
I drink too much.

01:19:39.289 --> 01:19:41.257
What?

01:20:20.465 --> 01:20:25.960
I'm glad to see you're
awake, Dr. Menville.

01:20:32.512 --> 01:20:35.413
I hope you don't mind...

01:20:35.481 --> 01:20:39.474
that Harry and Dick
had to dress you.

01:20:39.552 --> 01:20:44.387
You were improperly
attired for the occasion.

01:20:44.457 --> 01:20:46.618
What occasion?

01:20:47.894 --> 01:20:51.296
I'm throwing a party upstairs.

01:20:51.365 --> 01:20:54.994
I throw one every spring
for my clients.

01:20:55.069 --> 01:20:57.833
All right.

01:20:57.905 --> 01:20:59.896
Okay.

01:21:06.313 --> 01:21:08.907
- What do you want with me?
- To you...

01:21:08.983 --> 01:21:14.149
I would like to give a present.

01:21:14.222 --> 01:21:17.089
The gift of life...

01:21:17.158 --> 01:21:21.652
and youth forever.

01:21:27.869 --> 01:21:32.330
I saw your wife and friend.

01:21:32.408 --> 01:21:34.535
You did brilliant work.

01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:36.544
Show me your hand.

01:21:39.949 --> 01:21:43.146
Come on.
I won't bite.

01:21:45.521 --> 01:21:49.321
What are you doing?

01:21:50.727 --> 01:21:53.787
I'm loving you.

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:47.651
My God!

01:22:50.256 --> 01:22:52.781
Oh, thank you.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:23:01.128
But don't be modest.
That's what you do.

01:23:01.201 --> 01:23:04.295
This is what
you've always done.

01:23:04.371 --> 01:23:08.330
Stopped time in people's
faces and in their hands.

01:23:08.408 --> 01:23:11.537
You are like Don Quixote,

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:15.912
tilting at nature's windmill.

01:23:15.983 --> 01:23:19.043
Drink it.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.089
Go on.

01:23:22.156 --> 01:23:27.219
It is the completion
of your life's work.

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:30.526
You gave other people youth...

01:23:30.599 --> 01:23:33.295
and wasted your own.

01:23:33.368 --> 01:23:35.666
Drink!

01:23:35.737 --> 01:23:38.900
You'll be able to work again...
forever.

01:23:38.974 --> 01:23:41.636
Drink.

01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:44.304
Drink!
Dr. Menville!

01:23:44.379 --> 01:23:49.248
You owe yourself
another chance. Drink!

01:23:49.317 --> 01:23:52.481
Make the right choice!
The only choice!

01:23:52.555 --> 01:23:55.820
Drink!
Siempre viva!

01:23:55.892 --> 01:23:58.588
Live forever!

01:23:58.661 --> 01:24:01.926
Then what?

01:24:01.998 --> 01:24:04.762
What?

01:24:04.834 --> 01:24:07.769
- Then what happens?
- What?

01:24:07.837 --> 01:24:11.706
I don't wanna live forever.

01:24:11.775 --> 01:24:15.871
It sounds good, but what am I gonna do?
What if I get bored?

01:24:15.946 --> 01:24:18.676
- What?
- What if I get lonely?

01:24:18.749 --> 01:24:20.876
Who am I gonna hang around with,
Madeline and Helen?

01:24:20.951 --> 01:24:23.044
What if something happens to me?
What if I get maimed?

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.146
What if I get shot?
What if somebody pushes me down--

01:24:26.223 --> 01:24:28.783
What if I fall down a flight
of stairs or something?

01:24:28.859 --> 01:24:32.352
- But you never grow old.
- But everybody else will.

01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:34.694
I'll have to watch
everyone around me die.

01:24:36.267 --> 01:24:38.258
I don't think this is right.

01:24:38.336 --> 01:24:41.032
This is not a dream.
This is a nightmare.

01:24:41.105 --> 01:24:43.437
You people all
have to be stopped.

01:24:43.508 --> 01:24:46.170
Dick, Tom, Harry.

01:24:47.545 --> 01:24:49.911
Get the potion from him!

01:24:55.554 --> 01:24:59.422
- Get him! Get him!
- Relax. He won't go far.

01:24:59.492 --> 01:25:01.927
Not at his age.

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:49.874
Welcome, everyone. Lisle will
be down in a few minutes.

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:59.313
First, I must remind all of you
who staged your own deaths...

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:02.220
of our very strict
policy against...

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:06.124
popping up in public
to grab a few headlines.

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:11.823
I won't name names.
You know who you are.

01:26:14.203 --> 01:26:17.570
I was just trying to
have some fun. That's all.

01:26:18.808 --> 01:26:20.799
Look!
There's Ernest!

01:26:22.512 --> 01:26:25.413
Oh, my God!
He still looks like hell.

01:26:25.481 --> 01:26:27.506
I don't think she gave him
the good stuff.

01:26:27.583 --> 01:26:30.314
Look!

01:26:30.387 --> 01:26:32.753
He's still got it!

01:26:34.658 --> 01:26:36.057
Let's go.

01:26:36.126 --> 01:26:38.492
Oh, everybody gather round.

01:26:38.562 --> 01:26:40.496
Lisle will be with us
in a very few seconds.

01:26:40.564 --> 01:26:43.328
Gentlemen, please,
seal the room.

01:27:06.357 --> 01:27:08.848
He's going up.

01:27:08.927 --> 01:27:10.793
Idiot!

01:27:28.814 --> 01:27:30.874
Aaah!

01:27:58.246 --> 01:28:00.339
Oh, boy!

01:28:51.402 --> 01:28:53.734
Ernest!

01:28:59.576 --> 01:29:02.511
Ernest!

01:29:02.579 --> 01:29:05.446
- Helen!
- Grab it!

01:29:08.719 --> 01:29:10.881
- I--
Ernest!

01:29:10.955 --> 01:29:13.082
Ernest! Grab it!

01:29:13.158 --> 01:29:16.093
Grab it!

01:29:16.161 --> 01:29:18.652
Grab it!
Grab it!

01:29:23.768 --> 01:29:27.329
Ernest! Do you still have the potion?
Do you still have it?

01:29:27.405 --> 01:29:30.135
Find it! Find it!

01:29:30.208 --> 01:29:33.542
It's the only way
you'll survive if you fall.

01:29:33.612 --> 01:29:36.012
Drink it!
Drink it or you'll die!

01:29:38.084 --> 01:29:39.984
- Oh!
- After you fall,

01:29:40.052 --> 01:29:43.044
you can put yourself
back together again.

01:29:44.857 --> 01:29:48.054
Drink it!

01:29:48.127 --> 01:29:50.926
- Drink it. Drink it!
- Drink it!

01:29:52.966 --> 01:29:55.526
Drink it! Drink it!

01:29:57.704 --> 01:30:00.264
You have to!

01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:02.968
We need you!

01:30:07.881 --> 01:30:10.111
I'm sorry, dears.

01:30:10.183 --> 01:30:12.880
You're on your own.

01:30:52.362 --> 01:30:54.296
So...

01:30:54.364 --> 01:30:56.855
are you gonna be
done soon or what?

01:30:58.601 --> 01:31:03.595
Oh, yes!
I'm gonna be done very soon.

01:31:08.344 --> 01:31:11.439
That was pretty neat.

01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:47.978
It'd be better for both of you
to get him back.

01:31:48.053 --> 01:31:52.115
- Yes?
- Nothing. It's too late. He got away.

01:31:52.191 --> 01:31:54.455
- Damn!
- I said we should go to the airport!

01:31:54.527 --> 01:31:57.189
- You said no such thing.
- I knew he wasn't coming back here.

01:31:57.263 --> 01:32:00.460
- You have all the answers, don't you?
- Ohh! Look!

01:32:00.533 --> 01:32:03.502
- I'm peeling already!
- Oh!

01:32:03.569 --> 01:32:07.130
- Me too!
- Who's gonna fix this?

01:32:07.206 --> 01:32:10.004
- We're in trouble. Ernest is gone.
- Uh-huh.

01:32:10.076 --> 01:32:14.173
We can't go back to Lisle's.
She told us to take care of our bodies.

01:32:14.248 --> 01:32:17.945
- And look at us! We're dead!
- Yeah!

01:32:18.018 --> 01:32:20.748
This is so embarrassing.

01:32:20.821 --> 01:32:25.315
You know what this is? This is simply
a question of, uh, maintenance!

01:32:25.392 --> 01:32:29.795
Yeah, this is upkeep. We just have
to be very careful with ourselves.

01:32:29.863 --> 01:32:32.196
We have to take
care of each other.

01:32:32.267 --> 01:32:36.294
I'll paint your ass;
you paint mine.

01:32:36.371 --> 01:32:38.532
- Who could have imagined?
- Yeah.

01:32:38.606 --> 01:32:41.336
- You and me... together.
- Yeah, I know.

01:32:41.409 --> 01:32:44.310
Depending on each other.

01:32:44.379 --> 01:32:47.439
Painting each other's asses.

01:32:47.515 --> 01:32:50.815
- Day and night.
- Oh, yeah. Forever.

01:32:50.886 --> 01:32:54.456
Forever.

01:33:01.530 --> 01:33:04.897
We're gathered here today
to honor the passing...

01:33:04.967 --> 01:33:09.165
of a man of courage
and of vision.

01:33:09.238 --> 01:33:14.142
Now, Dr. Ernest Menville
always felt life begins at 50.

01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:17.577
And since we know so little
of Ernest before that age,

01:33:17.647 --> 01:33:20.275
perhaps in his case,
it's really true.

01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:24.844
Because it wasn't until 50
he met his lovely wife, Claire,

01:33:24.921 --> 01:33:28.618
that he had two sons
and four daughters...

01:33:28.692 --> 01:33:32.060
and then like a
biblical patriarch...

01:33:32.129 --> 01:33:34.893
began to spread
his message of hope...

01:33:34.965 --> 01:33:39.527
to his adopted children
all around the world.

01:33:39.603 --> 01:33:44.233
A brilliant academic
as well as a rugged outdoorsman,

01:33:44.308 --> 01:33:48.244
Dr. Menville pursued with vigor
a variety of pursuits...

01:33:48.312 --> 01:33:52.079
not just to attain
some personal ambition...

01:33:52.150 --> 01:33:55.847
but to enhance
the world for us...

01:33:55.921 --> 01:34:00.483
and make it a better place
than he found it.

01:34:00.559 --> 01:34:03.084
Oh, and that he did.

01:34:03.161 --> 01:34:06.096
The Menville Marriage
Counseling Clinic,

01:34:06.164 --> 01:34:09.565
the Menville Center
for the Study of Women,

01:34:09.634 --> 01:34:15.198
and of course, Ernest's AA chapter
will carry on long after his death.

01:34:25.585 --> 01:34:29.521
was for him
a delightful adventure.

01:34:29.589 --> 01:34:34.050
Who among us never knew
Ernest the prankster? Hmm?

01:34:34.128 --> 01:34:36.528
Ernest the storyteller?

01:34:36.597 --> 01:34:42.160
We've all heard his tall tales about
the living dead in Beverly Hills.

01:34:42.236 --> 01:34:47.674
- Ah, but you see--
- Oh, what?

01:34:47.741 --> 01:34:52.270
- You're not crying, are you?
- I'm not crying.

01:34:52.347 --> 01:34:56.147
I have...
something in my eye.

01:35:00.054 --> 01:35:02.852
- Oh!
- Yech!

01:35:02.924 --> 01:35:06.189
Oh! Do you have
that number 9 acrylic?

01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:08.786
Look. I put it in your bag.

01:35:08.863 --> 01:35:10.991
- Oh!
- I must have dropped it somewhere.

01:35:11.066 --> 01:35:14.593
- No. I put it in your bag!
- Well.

01:35:14.670 --> 01:35:17.503
Who could drop a big can of
spray paint for God's sake?

01:35:17.573 --> 01:35:21.134
I had it
when we left the car, okay?

01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:23.838
Let's get the hell outta here.

01:35:23.913 --> 01:35:29.078
I, for one, honestly believe
this teacher, this benefactor,

01:35:29.151 --> 01:35:34.146
this man, had in his own way...

01:35:34.224 --> 01:35:38.627
learned the secret
of eternal life.

01:35:40.797 --> 01:35:46.702
And it's here, among us,
in the hearts of his friends.

01:35:46.770 --> 01:35:51.674
And the secret
of eternal youth right here...

01:35:51.742 --> 01:35:56.736
in the lives of his children
and his grandchildren.

01:35:56.814 --> 01:36:01.114
It is my opinion
that our beloved Ernest...

01:36:01.185 --> 01:36:04.951
is one man who will indeed...

01:36:05.022 --> 01:36:09.652
live forever.

01:36:09.727 --> 01:36:13.255
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:36:13.332 --> 01:36:16.028
What'd you do
with that spray paint can?

01:36:16.101 --> 01:36:19.537
Come on. Get off that. Let me see what
kind of a mess you've made of yourself.

01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:24.332
Oh, yeah, you're all runny.

01:36:24.409 --> 01:36:28.539
- I must look ridiculous.
- No, I don't think anyone will notice.

01:36:28.614 --> 01:36:31.675
But I think you're gonna need
a little bondo on the chin, babe.

01:36:31.751 --> 01:36:34.345
- I gotta get to the hardware store.
- Oh, now, come on!

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:36.615
How could you have lost
an entire can of spray paint?

01:36:36.689 --> 01:36:39.715
Why do I have to carry everything?
You get to carry a baby purse.

01:36:39.792 --> 01:36:42.192
- Where did you see it last?
- If I knew, I'd know where it was.

01:36:42.262 --> 01:36:45.288
- An entire can of spray paint.
- Get off it!

01:36:45.365 --> 01:36:47.890
Has that ever worked? When you ask
me where I last saw something?

01:36:47.967 --> 01:36:50.869
Yes. When you lost
your index finger.

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:54.396
- I didn't lose it. It broke off.
- That's because you crack--

01:36:56.710 --> 01:37:00.111
Help me! My legs aren't working!
Help me!

01:37:31.847 --> 01:37:35.684
Do you remember
where you parked the car?

01:37:36.305 --> 01:37:42.370
