00:02.880 --> 00:04.836
<i>My name's James Lester.</i>

00:05.200 --> 00:07.555
<i>Five years ago,
I was put in charge of the ARC,</i>

00:07.640 --> 00:09.551
<i>a top-secret government project</i>

00:09.640 --> 00:13.110
<i>investigating rips in time
known as anomalies.</i>

00:14.200 --> 00:18.193
<i>These anomalies allowed
long-extinct creatures from distant eras</i>

00:18.280 --> 00:20.350
<i>to cross into our own time.</i>

00:24.080 --> 00:27.356
<i>Our leading research scientist
was murdered</i>

00:27.440 --> 00:29.510
<i>by his insane wife Helen,</i>

00:29.920 --> 00:32.308
<i>who planned to wipe out humanity.</i>

00:33.720 --> 00:36.439
She's gone to kill the first human,
stop our evolution in its tracks.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.032
<i>Danny Quinn, Connor Temple
and Abby Maitland</i>

00:41.120 --> 00:43.509
<i>went through an anomaly to stop her.</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:45.875
<i>No one knows what happened to them.</i>

00:47.040 --> 00:51.113
<i>But as the human race survived,
we must assume they succeeded.</i>

00:53.200 --> 00:55.395
- This thing's just died.
- We don't know the route.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.038
We can't get home.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.951
<i>None of them ever returned,</i>

00:59.040 --> 01:02.237
<i>lost forever in a distant past,
with no way home.</i>

01:04.000 --> 01:06.230
<i>All attempts at rescue failed.</i>

01:08.360 --> 01:10.555
<i>A new team was put in place,</i>

01:11.080 --> 01:13.469
<i>and many changes made to the ARC.</i>

01:14.600 --> 01:16.431
<i>The battle continues.</i>

01:16.880 --> 01:19.030
<i>There is always a new threat.</i>

01:19.120 --> 01:21.588
<i>Whatever it is, we'll deal with it.</i>

02:34.240 --> 02:35.309
Talk to me, Jess.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.870
It's my fault. I released the airlock
in the menagerie too early.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.798
They were doing maintenance work
and the creature got out.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.074
God, I'm sorry.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.275
Concentrate, Jess.
Have you got a visual?

02:46.360 --> 02:48.510
It's moving into the corridor by Lab 3.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.509
Matt!

02:53.600 --> 02:54.794
I know.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.995
Backup needed, south corridor by Lab 3.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.718
<i>Backup to south corridor.</i>

03:01.800 --> 03:02.949
Hello.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.469
Easy.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.189
Oh!

03:28.480 --> 03:29.515
Are you okay?

03:31.360 --> 03:33.237
<i>Matt, can you hear me?</i>

03:34.360 --> 03:35.634
I'm fine.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.594
Get out of there, Jess.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.511
I've just got to back up the system.
This is all my fault.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.990
Forget about that and get out of there.
It's coming your way.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.879
After it.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.390
Would someone mind telling me
what on earth is going...

04:06.480 --> 04:07.549
on?

04:12.440 --> 04:13.555
Hey!

04:14.080 --> 04:15.672
Tranq guns, now!

04:16.440 --> 04:18.476
There, there. Nice dragon.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.039
Down, boy. Sit.

04:21.279 --> 04:22.269
Actually, it's a girl.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.309
Hey!

04:31.480 --> 04:32.993
Here, princess.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.394
Come on.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.555
Purely as a matter of interest,
what's it doing in here?

04:41.120 --> 04:43.031
We'll get to that later.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.348
Come on.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.715
No, no, no, no, not my office.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.959
Come on, girl.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.158
Here you go. Have a drink.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.034
Right.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.875
So, there was nowhere else it could go?

05:21.720 --> 05:23.836
- I was improvising.
- Oh.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.112
Oh, Connor, you scared
the hell out of me.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.679
You're getting sloppy.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.796
Yeah, well, I have to let you win
every now and then.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.314
What? You never even saw me coming.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.753
Oh, really?

06:42.840 --> 06:44.159
- Huh?
- Ha!

06:49.720 --> 06:51.312
I can take you any time I like.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.035
Keep still or I'll have your ear off.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.912
I hear tapping.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.472
It's just the wind.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.035
Yeah.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.190
One day, it'll be more
than just the wind.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.555
That anomaly's going to reopen.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.513
I mean it.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.673
We've got to keep believing that, right?
We can't...

07:55.760 --> 07:57.398
Can't lose faith.

07:57.480 --> 08:01.439
Connor, there is nothing we can do
to get ourselves out of here.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.598
But we can at least make sure
we stay alive.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.834
So peel.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.868
You know, when we do get home,
I'm going to write a cookbook.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.834
<i>1,001 Ways to Cook Roots and Bulbs.</i>

08:23.800 --> 08:26.837
I could be like
your Cretaceous celebrity chef.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.395
Hmm.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.952
Oh, I had a dream
about coffee last night.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.559
I would kill for a decent cappuccino.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.914
Connor, don't go there.

08:39.000 --> 08:39.989
Sorry.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.910
I should be thinking tasty roots,

08:43.120 --> 08:44.519
yummy bulbs.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.713
Go do some hunter-gathering, yeah?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.234
We will make it home, one day.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.715
Mmm.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.793
Yeah, I'm sure there's a perfectly
rational explanation for this.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.872
Um... Jess?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.834
- It was...
- My fault, James. Sorry.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.196
I was overseeing some maintenance
at the menagerie,

09:38.280 --> 09:42.034
there was a problem with the airlock,
dracorex got spooked and bolted.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.109
Won't happen again.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.914
You know, I could have been
ambassador to Moscow by now,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.036
maybe even Cabinet Secretary.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.593
Instead, I'm watching a dinosaur
trash my office.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.271
Still, no regrets.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.918
Becker's going to tranq it.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.513
Shouldn't be long now.

10:13.760 --> 10:14.909
Don't you think you should help him?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.230
Where would be the fun in that?

10:27.440 --> 10:30.477
I'll have Sleeping Beauty moved
to the menagerie.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.516
Good work. Meet me in the armoury
in half an hour.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.635
Why?

10:33.720 --> 10:36.473
Haven't you heard?
The EMDs have arrived.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.518
The electro-muscular disruption weapons?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.431
Oh, yes, the toy guns.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.992
If the toy guns had been here this
morning, this wouldn't have happened.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.709
Gotcha.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.119
Sorry, mate.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.475
Abby!

11:56.720 --> 11:57.835
Abby!

12:00.080 --> 12:01.559
- Abby!
- Connor!

12:04.440 --> 12:06.749
Everything inside! Quickly!

12:07.960 --> 12:09.234
Come on!

12:16.920 --> 12:18.069
Abby!

12:22.360 --> 12:23.588
Come on!

12:42.720 --> 12:43.709
We have to move camp.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.233
We can't leave the anomaly site.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.033
What if it opens up again
and we miss it?

12:48.120 --> 12:52.398
Spinosauruses are territorial, Connor.
Now it knows we're here, it'll be back.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.436
- We have to go.
- No.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.715
Abby, we could be missing
our only chance to get out of here.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.074
What chance?

13:01.880 --> 13:04.155
We've been here a year, Connor,

13:04.400 --> 13:05.594
a year,

13:06.200 --> 13:08.191
and nothing has happened.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.917
Just face it.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.238
We're stuck here,

13:14.920 --> 13:16.069
alone,

13:17.800 --> 13:19.074
forever.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.514
You're wrong.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.432
And we're not alone.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.073
We're together.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.192
If we stay here,

13:43.400 --> 13:45.630
that spinosaurus will kill us.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.951
Only a matter of time.

13:50.720 --> 13:51.835
Okay?

14:11.120 --> 14:12.473
You're late.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.596
Oh, excellent. Tasers.

14:15.080 --> 14:18.789
These are in a different league to
any Tasers you've ever used in the past.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.872
I wouldn't have designed it
if it didn't work.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.236
You need to remember
how many friends I've lost.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.992
I'm not going to risk any more lives
playing around with peashooters.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.113
The EMD can be adapted
to three basic levels,

14:33.200 --> 14:35.634
low, medium and high-voltage,
depending on what you're using it for.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.029
Yeah, I know what they do, Jess.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.911
I don't think he believes us.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.355
This is nothing like
you've ever experienced before.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.033
Okay, try.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.314
I mean it. Shock me.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.914
If I think it's an effective weapon,
I'll use it.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.915
If not, you back down.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.911
You really, really don't want me
to do that, Becker.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.274
Oh, I do.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.476
Come on, Matt, show me what you've got.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.955
Matt?

15:03.640 --> 15:04.959
You can't.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.797
Will you stop being such a pair of kids?

15:07.880 --> 15:09.359
He started it.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.272
It's okay. He'll live.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.149
Probably.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.912
Have you fired it...

15:19.320 --> 15:21.072
Are you okay?

15:21.160 --> 15:23.196
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.156
That was the lowest setting
on the smallest version of the weapon.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.869
The highest is designed
to bring down a Tyrannosaurus rex.

15:38.680 --> 15:39.908
How far do we have to go?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.877
A mile, maybe two.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.159
What was that?

15:46.080 --> 15:47.308
Raptor.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.516
Come on. Just leave it, come on.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.952
That's my blanket.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.359
Blanket?

16:45.440 --> 16:46.589
Abby!

16:48.600 --> 16:51.239
Are you absolutely sold on these EMDs?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.830
'Cause, you know,
I could always shoot you again.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.589
Idiot.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.030
How long until this wears off?

17:03.040 --> 17:07.157
Burning, a couple of hours.
Headaches, couple of days.

17:08.319 --> 17:13.473
The humiliation, well, that kind of
depends when I get bored of it, really.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.156
You're not really
a very funny man, Matt.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.510
Depends on your point of view.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.439
Look, Becker.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.472
I know you've lost friends,

17:25.480 --> 17:29.393
but I need you to understand that
I won't do anything to risk the team.

17:29.480 --> 17:33.268
After Sarah was killed,
I thought about quitting.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.677
Danny, Connor, Abby...

17:40.640 --> 17:44.713
And the one thing I can do here is
make sure that never happens again.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.994
It wasn't your fault. You know that.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.710
It was my job to look after them.
I failed.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.232
It was a year ago.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.837
You really need to let it go now, mate.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.912
You trust me, right?

18:03.280 --> 18:04.918
Yeah, with my life.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.709
You're not going to hug me now, are you?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.548
God, no.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.359
Just collect them in a pile, Cerys,
and I'll sort through them later.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.831
Another tantrum, James?

18:22.120 --> 18:25.635
Really must learn to control
that fiery temper of yours.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.234
Very amusing, Philip.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.312
Thank you, ladies.
Um, we'll resume, shall we?

18:31.440 --> 18:35.638
If you need any more help with these
creatures, all you have to do is ask.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.789
I think we can manage.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.393
Evidently.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.469
- I've just had lunch with the Minister.
- Really?

18:46.560 --> 18:50.155
I didn't, uh, hear about any lunch.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.674
Oh, it was arranged ages ago.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.875
He wants me to put another half-billion
into the anomaly project.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.394
Mmm, and what did you say?

18:58.480 --> 18:59.595
Oh, I agreed.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.274
I mean, if we're going to make these
private-public partnerships work,

19:02.360 --> 19:03.952
we entrepreneurs have to do our bit.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.919
Anything you need, James,
all you have to do is ask.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.151
All of Prospero's resources
are at your disposal.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.436
We're in this together.

19:27.480 --> 19:28.595
Jess?

19:28.800 --> 19:31.109
I need you to hack
into Philip's private diary.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.358
Next time he has lunch with
the Minister, I want to know about it.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.351
No private hacking.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.477
Excuse me?
Whatever happened to blind obedience?

19:48.680 --> 19:50.159
Morning, Matt.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.955
So, why did you cover for Jess?

19:56.560 --> 19:57.959
I had the logs checked.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.156
The airlock was opened
from her terminal.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.639
Yeah, I was using her computer.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.311
You're a terrible liar.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.114
To be honest,
I don't really need to know.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.270
Good management is about picking
the right people for the job,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.669
and letting them get on with it.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.598
Till they screw up.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.999
What's it doing?

20:29.080 --> 20:30.559
Building a bower.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.629
Eh?

20:31.720 --> 20:33.039
Oh, a nest.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.279
What's it want with our stuff?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.874
Well, he's trying to make it
as decorative as he can.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.678
Helps him to, uh...

20:41.680 --> 20:42.795
Pull.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.555
I was going to say "attract a mate"
but yes, pull.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.632
This time, he's going
to have to send her flowers.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.950
You can stay here. I'll go.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.389
Oops.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.469
Careful.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.709
Sorry.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.549
What have you got in here?

21:12.640 --> 21:13.629
My gloves.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.914
Connor!

21:15.120 --> 21:16.109
Wondered where they went to.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.475
You've got to get out of there.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.149
Abby!

21:26.240 --> 21:27.389
Get out of there, Connor!

21:30.400 --> 21:32.356
I don't believe it! Abby!

21:32.680 --> 21:33.795
Look.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.638
It's the anomaly device,
what's left of it, anyway.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.870
This must have been Helen's.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.599
Is it still working?

21:42.680 --> 21:43.795
Uh...

21:45.960 --> 21:47.075
Uh...

22:00.680 --> 22:01.749
Forget it, Connor. It's dead.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.479
No. No, it's going to work. It has to.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.113
Take the battery out
and shake it or something.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.431
- Oh, for...
- Well, whatever the equivalent is, then.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.909
Always worked with the TV remote.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.635
Fine.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.309
Abby?

22:27.640 --> 22:28.755
What?

22:33.160 --> 22:34.559
Oh, my God!

22:37.120 --> 22:38.189
You genius!

22:39.680 --> 22:40.715
Now do something brilliant.

22:40.800 --> 22:41.915
Okay.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.794
Where are you?

23:01.040 --> 23:02.359
Connor.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.594
Shall we?

23:22.720 --> 23:23.835
Yeah.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.997
Anomaly detected.
Stand by for data transmission readings.

23:42.080 --> 23:46.278
<i>Location details,
map coordinates 77425.</i>

23:46.560 --> 23:49.870
Distance 8.3 miles, heading 270.

23:50.440 --> 23:53.113
<i>Route downloaded to all black box units.</i>

24:02.760 --> 24:03.909
Okay.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.998
Chances of us nipping around the side
without him noticing?

24:06.080 --> 24:07.069
None.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.149
Yeah, that's pretty much what I thought.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.515
I don't care about long odds.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.470
I'm going to go through it.

24:17.840 --> 24:18.909
I've got an idea.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.110
Abby, no, that's insane. No! Abby!

24:23.200 --> 24:25.919
Estimated journey time, 11 minutes.

24:26.280 --> 24:29.829
Population density high,
49 structures within Q-radius.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.514
Average height, 19.8 metres.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.919
Come on, Abby.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.352
Hey! Yeah!

24:48.040 --> 24:49.996
That's it! Yeah!

25:14.520 --> 25:15.839
- Lovely work.
- Thanks.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.313
Okay.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.151
Okay, this is promising.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.959
Are we home?

25:47.520 --> 25:48.839
Connor.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.279
Are we back?

25:52.440 --> 25:56.513
Well, one good thing, I don't think
we're going to get eaten here.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.112
Keep your hands down
where we can see them.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.389
Down on the ground!

26:17.480 --> 26:18.708
- Face down!
- Okay!

26:18.800 --> 26:20.518
On the ground, now!

26:35.120 --> 26:37.759
I hope you brought me back a souvenir.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.915
Where the hell have you been?

27:01.080 --> 27:04.072
You know, we were in there.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.956
We would have called,
but the reception was terrible.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.271
We came looking for you.
We sent four missions.

27:11.440 --> 27:12.429
We tried everything.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.353
It doesn't matter now. We're back.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.797
And everything is going to bejust fine.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.038
- We did it.
- I know.

27:24.840 --> 27:25.875
Yes!

27:31.640 --> 27:33.756
Connor and Abby came through
the anomaly!

27:33.840 --> 27:35.717
They're back! They made it!

27:37.280 --> 27:39.271
What... What about Danny?

27:39.960 --> 27:41.439
So, where's Danny?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.118
Is he not with you?

27:45.520 --> 27:47.556
No, he never made it back.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.316
Matt, I'd like to introduce you
to two of my good friends.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.879
Abby Maitland.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.952
Connor Temple. It's great to meet you.
I'm Matt Anderson.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.632
I'll have someone escort you back
to the ARC.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.039
Keep three men on site
until the anomaly closes.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.394
And the rest patrolling
a half-mile exclusion.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.515
Great.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.352
Hang on, you don't need to wait
until it closes.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.192
I can do it for you.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.551
It works, believe me.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.552
He's done it before.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.998
Now you see it...

28:18.160 --> 28:19.559
Wait a sec.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.389
Yeah, that's not meant to happen.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.158
That's my blanket.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.874
- So sorry, mate.
- Don't worry about it.

29:01.960 --> 29:02.949
Jess.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.759
We've got a large theropod on location.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.592
I need to grid-map of the area.
Two miles radius.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.557
Downloading to your remote.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.551
Yeah, just give me the biggest
controlled space you can.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.790
- Stand by.
- Yeah, hurry up about it, Jess.

29:13.880 --> 29:14.995
Well, obviously.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.399
It's a spinosaurus, by the way.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.674
Thanks.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.918
Do you think they know
what they're doing?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.398
- What's going on?
- Creature incursion.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.472
Ah, trust Connor to bring
a pet back with him.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.831
- But they're all right, are they?
- So far.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.595
Good. Keep it that way.
I want them back here in one piece.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.755
Oi!

30:01.520 --> 30:03.033
We're going to have
to corral it somehow.

30:03.120 --> 30:06.317
Not in this.
We're going to need something bigger.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.070
I'm going to need to borrow your truck.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.592
What have you got for me, Jess?

30:25.680 --> 30:27.636
There's an arena
a mile to the northwest.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.551
Make sure the access doors are open.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.629
Already done.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.515
Becker, where are you?

30:35.600 --> 30:36.635
Two streets over.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.438
We're going to have to get it
into this arena.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.590
What if it decides it wants
to go somewhere else?

30:40.680 --> 30:41.954
Then persuade it otherwise.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.793
Is that phone insured?

30:53.880 --> 30:56.269
Good. And you, get a haircut.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.838
All right, Matt, here we are.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.194
<i>What now?</i>

31:24.400 --> 31:26.072
Your guess is as good as mine.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.229
Matt!

31:49.640 --> 31:51.551
Reverse. That way!

31:51.640 --> 31:52.755
Yup.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.429
- Go.
- Yeah.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.033
Go, go, go!

32:06.280 --> 32:07.633
They need to get into the arena now.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.792
Jess, need to raise comms
in Victor Sierra Alpha 7.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.951
You don't think that
you're driving too close to the kerb?

32:29.040 --> 32:31.713
Abby, Connor, this is the ARC.
Please respond.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.439
Uh, this is Connor Temple.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.317
Sorry about nicking your car.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.594
Don't scratch the paintwork.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.113
<i>I've got a message from Matt.</i>

32:41.200 --> 32:42.599
You need to lead the spinosaurus
to the arena.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.796
<i>I repeat, lead it to the arena.</i>

32:44.880 --> 32:46.791
The arena. Right, cool.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.355
Uh, what arena?
Where the hell is the arena?

32:50.400 --> 32:53.517
Maintain direction for 300 yards.
Take the second turn on the right.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.875
- Second turn on your...
- I'm not deaf, Connor.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.678
- Sorry.
- But thanks.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.918
Why aren't they back yet? They okay?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.592
They've stolen a car.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.877
Right, so they're fine, then.
Yeah, nobody speaks to me.

33:08.840 --> 33:11.229
Hands off. These are my controls.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.959
You can be replaced, you know.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.234
You're hilarious.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.390
Matt, the arena doors are open,
so you're good to go.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.072
Oh... Uh, sorry.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.593
As you were.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.268
If we can just open an anomaly...

34:20.280 --> 34:21.632
Maybe we should let them handle it.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.710
Just need a few minutes.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.592
Right, full plate attachments.

34:26.679 --> 34:28.318
Wait for my word.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.828
Come on.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.119
- Okay, stand by.
- All units into position.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.918
Fire on my command.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.518
Oh, come on.

34:48.440 --> 34:51.237
I can't use it here.
I need to get closer.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.592
Connor! No, wait!

34:54.960 --> 34:56.109
What the hell is he playing at?

34:56.199 --> 34:57.997
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.229
Does he do this kind of thing often?

34:59.320 --> 35:01.197
Yeah, every now and again.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.430
And how does it normally turn out?

35:03.520 --> 35:04.589
Mmm.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.588
Come on.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.638
We can't risk firing
with Connor in the way.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.113
Come with me.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.628
Come on!

35:38.120 --> 35:39.348
Come on!

35:42.680 --> 35:43.795
Ah...

35:45.920 --> 35:47.433
This is not so cool.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.508
Come on.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.918
Connor, get clear!

36:27.680 --> 36:28.908
Just give me a second.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.272
Connor! Grab hold!

36:35.440 --> 36:36.793
Take us up!

36:42.040 --> 36:43.393
- Connor!
- Hold on, I can do this!

36:43.480 --> 36:44.674
Grab me with both hands!

36:45.680 --> 36:46.669
We're clear!

36:46.760 --> 36:47.875
Fire!

36:56.880 --> 36:57.869
What was that?

36:59.560 --> 37:00.709
The line's jammed.

37:03.840 --> 37:04.829
No!

37:04.920 --> 37:06.558
Let go of the device
and grab me with both hands.

37:06.640 --> 37:07.789
Just need a little more time.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.791
We don't have any time.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.148
You don't know anywhere I can buy
a decent cappuccino, do you?

37:57.080 --> 38:01.039
Well, this is pretty sexy stuff.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.589
Don't tell me.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.638
You missed the last bus home
and had to walk.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.752
Something like that.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.116
It's so good to see you.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.268
Oh, oh.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.394
You, too.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.829
Ooh! I think your point's
been well made, don't you?

38:23.160 --> 38:24.434
Probably.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.633
Welcome back.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.197
- So, uh...
- Danny?

38:40.240 --> 38:42.151
He went on ahead of us.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.676
Whatever happened,
he must have taken Helen down with him.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.909
Right.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.629
Wow.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.557
Now, that is one serious upgrade.

39:01.360 --> 39:03.749
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Jess.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.476
So good to finally meet you guys.

39:06.560 --> 39:10.678
Becker's told me everything.
You guys are like legends around here.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.036
- Cheers, mate.
- Whatever. I thought you were dead.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.599
Where's Sarah?

39:16.320 --> 39:21.235
Abby, Connor, I can't tell you
what a relief it is to see you two.

39:21.920 --> 39:22.909
Forgive me.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.831
Philip Burton. I know.

39:26.040 --> 39:29.157
This is the man who invented
the room-temperature superconductor.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.996
- Huh?
- Um... Well...

39:32.080 --> 39:34.719
Wow. Yeah, he's like a living legend.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.592
If all the Fantastic Four
were just rolled into one,

39:36.680 --> 39:38.636
he'd kind of look a bit like this.

39:38.720 --> 39:42.349
But not be a superhero, obviously.
He's more of a science nerd.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.556
Thank you for the compliment, I think.

39:44.640 --> 39:47.916
Yeah. No, it was meant as a...
I'm just overexcited. Why are you here?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.912
After the catastrophe of your last trip,
the government decided

39:51.000 --> 39:54.356
the ARC would benefit from
private-sector management.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.034
Catastrophe?

39:56.120 --> 39:57.473
It was a bad time for all of us.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.356
There was a demand for new thinking,
you understand.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.953
More resources.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.313
Things had to change.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.437
But we can discuss all of this later.
Right now, you two need to be debriefed,

40:08.520 --> 40:10.829
and I want to hear every detail.

40:11.080 --> 40:14.789
I can't believe that I'm going
to be working with... Oh!

40:15.280 --> 40:16.633
Philip Burton!

40:19.640 --> 40:22.791
James, why don't we continue this
in your office?

40:33.600 --> 40:35.716
I'm sorry, but when
the ARC was reorganised,

40:35.800 --> 40:37.950
the decision was taken
to select operational staff

40:38.040 --> 40:39.393
with a military background.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.233
Front line is just no place
for amateurs.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.032
Amateurs, us?

40:44.920 --> 40:45.909
Perhaps that was the wrong word.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.389
Don't tell me you agreed to this.

40:48.760 --> 40:50.034
It was my idea.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.310
Take some personal time. Rest.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.269
Use the company apartment
for a few days.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.794
When you come back, we'll discuss
something away from the firing line.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.438
You don't get it.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.556
All the time we've just spent away,

41:03.640 --> 41:06.393
all the sacrifices we had to make,
it was all for this.

41:06.480 --> 41:09.950
So we could come back and carry on
with Professor Cutter's work!

41:10.040 --> 41:12.190
So we could fight until we actually won!

41:16.720 --> 41:17.755
So harsh.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.433
We can't quit now!

41:27.200 --> 41:28.679
Not after everything we've been through.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.075
It's for your own good, Connor.

41:33.440 --> 41:34.589
Is it?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.675
Your message sounded important.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.196
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.238
<i>Tacca chantrieri.</i>

42:20.400 --> 42:21.799
I've never seen one
outside of the tropics.

42:21.880 --> 42:24.394
Not endangered yet, but rare enough.

42:26.080 --> 42:28.150
Thank you. It's beautiful.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.194
So, what's happened?

42:36.280 --> 42:39.033
Connor Temple and Abby Maitland
are back.

42:39.800 --> 42:42.633
They survived 12 months
in the Cretaceous.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.992
That's remarkable.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.078
What about Quinn and Helen Cutter?

42:48.160 --> 42:49.195
No.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.039
What will happen to Connor and Abby now?

42:53.120 --> 42:56.590
They'll be debriefed in the morning.
After that, they're on their own.

42:56.680 --> 43:00.593
Connor Temple is gifted.
No one knows more about the anomalies.

43:02.160 --> 43:05.835
If they were inside the ARC,
you could keep an eye on them.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.391
It's out of my hands now.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.993
I'll monitor them,
see what they do next.

43:10.080 --> 43:11.195
Good.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.353
They may be the key to this whole thing.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.269
It's a beautiful world, Matthew.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.352
But for how much longer?

43:56.640 --> 43:58.437
- You're up early.
- Hi.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.193
You keeping watch?

44:03.280 --> 44:05.510
It still feels like one of us
has to keep guard.

44:06.800 --> 44:07.835
Yeah.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.119
Why don't I take the next shift?

44:17.080 --> 44:18.559
You get some rest.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.596
I'm happy here with you.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.352
- Come here.
- Mmm.
