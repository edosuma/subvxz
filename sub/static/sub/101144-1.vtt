<i>Good morning, everyone.
You are tuned to Planet Jazz.</i>

02:23.553 --> 02:24.784
Hmm?

02:30.918 --> 02:32.386
SamTeddy! SamTeddy!

02:34.586 --> 02:37.051
We're going to be late
for soccabasket!

02:38.486 --> 02:41.051
Stop hiding under the quilt,
you lazybones!

02:41.085 --> 02:43.253
Come on!

02:43.286 --> 02:46.253
- Morning, Mommy!
- Morning, my little hero!

02:48.586 --> 02:51.086
Morning, Daddy!
I'm off to play with my friends!

02:51.119 --> 02:52.286
Have fun!

02:52.319 --> 02:54.253
But stay away
from Planet Marth!

02:54.286 --> 02:56.751
Stay away from Planet Marth.
I know!

03:03.018 --> 03:05.486
Starbaby, breakfast is ready!

03:05.519 --> 03:08.086
Coming, honey!

03:08.119 --> 03:09.918
Have fun, SamSam!

03:21.386 --> 03:25.319
Something tells me
today's going to be the big day.

03:25.353 --> 03:28.286
I hate to sound like
a wet blanky, SamSam,

03:28.319 --> 03:32.152
but you say you're going to get
your first power every day.

03:32.186 --> 03:36.152
Today feels different.
Something's going to happen.

Mother, may I borrow your ship
to take Chomper for a walk?

04:03.985 --> 04:05.519
Certainly not!

04:05.553 --> 04:07.985
You know what makes
a truly great singer.

04:08.019 --> 04:10.486
Practice, practice, practice!

04:10.519 --> 04:14.985
Besides, you know your father
doesn't like you going out.

04:15.019 --> 04:18.019
Oh! Uh...

04:18.052 --> 04:20.286
Very well, but stay inside
the safety zone.

04:20.319 --> 04:22.985
Stay inside the safety zone.
I know!

04:40.152 --> 04:41.986
See you later!

05:16.386 --> 05:19.818
Oh, Chomper, I've had enough
of this silly safety zone.

05:21.486 --> 05:23.818
That's enough!
Stay, puppykins!

05:55.386 --> 05:58.453
Uh, sorry about the saucers.

05:58.485 --> 06:01.851
Don't worry, SamSam.
Can't say we're not used to it.

06:01.884 --> 06:05.751
Move yourselves! Thataway!

06:08.353 --> 06:10.485
- Can I play?
- Okay!

06:10.518 --> 06:12.818
SamSam, cut it out!

06:12.851 --> 06:14.986
Using your cape is cheating.

06:15.019 --> 06:17.152
You can only use your powers.

06:17.186 --> 06:19.353
But he hasn't got
any powers yet.

06:19.386 --> 06:22.119
You know that.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.452
Minimize!

06:27.485 --> 06:28.518
Whoa!

06:28.552 --> 06:30.052
Ow!

06:31.086 --> 06:32.286
Oh, dear.

06:33.585 --> 06:36.019
Brace yourselves.
Shake it!

06:36.052 --> 06:37.152
Whoa!

06:42.286 --> 06:44.485
Wow.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.152
Freedom at last!

07:35.219 --> 07:37.353
Children! Wow.

07:37.385 --> 07:40.019
I've never seen
real ones before.

07:40.052 --> 07:41.986
Catty says speedio!

07:45.319 --> 07:47.952

07:47.986 --> 07:50.986
Come on, puppy.
Gimme the ball.

07:52.485 --> 07:54.485
Yoo-hoo!

08:01.418 --> 08:03.819

08:06.253 --> 08:09.819
That's weird.
They don't look dangerous.

08:09.852 --> 08:11.518
Uh-oh.

08:11.552 --> 08:14.319
That means I have to go home.
Bye, guys.

08:14.352 --> 08:15.286
Same here.

08:19.585 --> 08:21.852
I'm going home too. Bye.

08:21.885 --> 08:24.319
Bye. Let's play
one last game, SweetPea.

08:24.352 --> 08:27.552
Uh, sorry, SamSam.
I promised MommyPea I'd...

08:27.585 --> 08:29.253
help her make
some mars-mallows.

08:29.286 --> 08:31.253
Can I borrow your ball
to practice with?

08:31.286 --> 08:33.485
Okay, but be sure
to give it back tomorrow.

08:33.518 --> 08:34.986

11:25.952 --> 11:27.518
If I kick the ball
through that hole,

11:27.552 --> 11:30.418
I really will get
my first power today.

11:30.452 --> 11:33.086
Hmm. Go on then.
You can do it.

11:37.418 --> 11:38.919
Oh, no!

11:48.553 --> 11:50.385
Shh.

11:51.553 --> 11:53.086
That kick didn't count.

11:53.118 --> 11:55.418
You put me off
by encouraging me.

11:55.452 --> 11:57.852
How much blame
can a teddy bear take?

11:59.952 --> 12:02.285
SamSam, time to go home.

12:10.019 --> 12:11.218
Yahoo!

12:11.252 --> 12:13.285
SamTeddy, did you see that?

12:18.318 --> 12:19.418
Oh, no!

12:19.452 --> 12:21.085
Never mind.
Time to go home.

12:21.118 --> 12:24.151
No! I promised SweetPea
his ball back,

12:24.185 --> 12:26.986
and I don't want
to let a friend down.

12:30.952 --> 12:32.118
"Friend?"

12:32.151 --> 12:34.318
What's a friend?

12:40.885 --> 12:42.385
Stop, SamSam!

12:42.418 --> 12:44.919
We're heading straight
for Planet Marth.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.318
Aah!

12:52.352 --> 12:54.553
Keep searching,
you useless cabbages,

12:54.586 --> 12:56.986

that giggling brat!

12:57.019 --> 12:59.752

are assassinating me!

13:28.885 --> 13:31.519

13:32.919 --> 13:33.919
Ohh!

13:35.018 --> 13:38.118
Help! Grab that thing!

13:40.885 --> 13:43.151
Give it back!

13:43.185 --> 13:45.051
Ooh! A little red elf.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.085
Red?

13:46.118 --> 13:47.952
What? It can't be.

13:47.986 --> 13:49.352
Give me that!

13:49.385 --> 13:51.151
Holy smokes!

13:51.185 --> 13:52.519
There's the culprit!

13:52.553 --> 13:57.151
A kid from Planet Sam
in a silly red mask.

14:02.252 --> 14:04.852
My revenge will be sweet.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.285
There we are.

14:14.318 --> 14:17.085
A super smelly-welly sock.

14:17.118 --> 14:22.185
What a dinky-stinky, mucky-yucky
sculpture I've made.

14:22.218 --> 14:24.218
Oh, poop. SamSam!

14:24.252 --> 14:26.819
My marvelous muck
is all blowing away.

14:26.852 --> 14:31.051
Come back, stinky sockies,
come back, come back.

14:31.085 --> 14:34.151
Sorry, Mucky Yuck.
I'll help you make a mess again.

14:34.185 --> 14:38.018
Thanks, SamSam.
You're a nice boy.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.018
You look down in my dumps.

14:40.051 --> 14:43.486
Mucky Yuck, how do you get by
without a cosmic power?

14:43.519 --> 14:45.885
What use would
a power be to me?

14:45.919 --> 14:48.386
I don't need any powers
to make my farty-art.

14:48.419 --> 14:49.852
Ta-ta-da!

14:49.885 --> 14:52.018
Here, have a fly-poop cookie.

14:52.051 --> 14:55.453
Uh, some other time.
Thanks.

15:06.951 --> 15:09.118
We mustn't tell
Mother and Father

15:09.151 --> 15:12.185
that we left the safety zone
and saw some children.

15:12.218 --> 15:13.951
Do you understand?

15:30.586 --> 15:31.885
Ahh!

15:34.185 --> 15:38.085
<i>Mega, remember you're
not allowed in this office.</i>

15:38.118 --> 15:40.918
And you remember
that if you tell on me,

15:40.951 --> 15:43.884
I'll tell Father you play
on the computer with Chomper.

15:51.553 --> 15:54.819
Computer, what is a friend?

15:54.852 --> 15:58.785
<i>A friend is a person you have
fun with and feel good with</i>

15:58.819 --> 16:02.785
<i>and share all your joys
and sorrows and secrets with.</i>

16:02.819 --> 16:05.453
Look! It's him!

16:05.486 --> 16:07.785
<i>It's SamSam and his friends.</i>

16:07.819 --> 16:10.252
<i>There he is with SamDaddy
and SamMommy,</i>

16:10.286 --> 16:12.353
<i>the fearsome cosmic heroes.</i>

16:12.386 --> 16:16.386
<i>And there's SamSam with his
friends at Cosmic Hero School.</i>

16:16.419 --> 16:18.386
What? He goes to school?

16:18.419 --> 16:22.453
<i>Yes, a special school for
children with cosmic powers.</i>

16:22.486 --> 16:25.118
<i>School is where people
make friends.</i>

16:25.151 --> 16:26.419
Wow.

16:33.453 --> 16:34.918
Aah!

16:36.918 --> 16:40.085
I don't understand why Father
says that children are horrible.

16:40.118 --> 16:42.118
They don't look...

16:42.151 --> 16:43.819
Quick!

16:43.851 --> 16:44.884

Marthial, I've told you
a thousand times.

17:58.519 --> 18:01.784
All the women in my family
have been opera singers

Well, I've told you
a thousand times,

18:09.985 --> 18:12.118
a real opera singer
doesn't quack like a duck.

18:12.151 --> 18:15.186
All Mega needs is some
professional training,

18:15.219 --> 18:17.219
which is why
I'm asking you again

18:17.253 --> 18:19.784
to let her study
at the School of Song.

18:19.818 --> 18:21.353
And the sooner, the better.

18:21.386 --> 18:24.051

18:31.951 --> 18:33.985
For once,
you agree on something.

any more presents!

19:08.586 --> 19:10.486
What I want...

19:10.519 --> 19:12.519
is a friend.

19:12.553 --> 19:16.085
Yes, Chomper,
I know you're my friend,

19:16.119 --> 19:19.253
but this is different.

19:34.586 --> 19:36.186
I know!

19:39.219 --> 19:40.918
Here it is.

19:40.951 --> 19:43.253
Cosmic Hero.

19:44.386 --> 19:45.918
- Mother?
- Yes.

19:45.951 --> 19:47.918
You know, I really
wanna be a singer.

19:47.951 --> 19:51.784
Oh, honey, deep down,
I always knew it.

19:51.818 --> 19:55.386
Father, you know, I really
wanna be a dictator.

19:55.419 --> 19:57.884
I always knew it, my dear.

19:57.918 --> 20:00.119
But I don't want to hurt
Father's feelings,

20:00.152 --> 20:02.918

Dictator School, okay?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.386

20:04.419 --> 20:06.419

so let's pretend I'm attending

all right, sweetie?

22:41.818 --> 22:43.152
Never mind.

22:45.419 --> 22:48.353
There you go.
Put this on.

22:48.386 --> 22:50.253
Oh, for goodness sake.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.453
Now go back to sleep

22:51.485 --> 22:53.086
and forget all about it,
my little hero.

22:53.119 --> 22:55.253
I'm not a little hero.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.452
I can't even crumble-mash
a Wettabed.

22:57.485 --> 23:00.086
SamSam, sweetie,
your powers are in you.

23:00.119 --> 23:03.319
Trust yourself and be patient.

23:03.353 --> 23:06.919
You'll find them very soon.
Don't you worry.

23:08.119 --> 23:09.353
Powers are in you,

23:09.386 --> 23:10.885
but your bottom's on me.

23:10.919 --> 23:12.052
Sorry, SamTeddy.

23:15.186 --> 23:19.186
SamSam, it's very dark in here,
don't you think?

23:19.219 --> 23:22.186
Heroes aren't
scared of the dark.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.852
Ow! Ouch!

23:27.885 --> 23:30.186
SamSam wet his bed again.

23:30.219 --> 23:34.052
Poor boy, he was so upset.
You should have seen his face.

23:34.086 --> 23:36.253
We should keep
a closer eye on him.

23:36.286 --> 23:38.784
How old were you
when you got your first power?

23:38.818 --> 23:41.986
The cosmic crush?
About one and a half, I suppose.

23:42.019 --> 23:45.418
Do you think SamSam
may not be like us?

23:45.452 --> 23:48.286
I mean, not a cosmic hero?

24:02.186 --> 24:06.186
My child, this is
your first day at school.

24:06.219 --> 24:10.418
You fill me with happiness
and pride.

24:10.452 --> 24:14.219
At Song School, you'll learn
how to sing like an angel.

24:14.253 --> 24:16.552
Uh, yes. Bye, Mother.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.852
- Bye, Father.
- Bye.

24:18.885 --> 24:20.784
Have a good time at...

24:20.819 --> 24:22.219
Dictator School.

24:35.319 --> 24:36.319
Hmm...

24:42.286 --> 24:45.352
As soon as I saw the Wettabeds,
I made the room shake,

24:45.385 --> 24:47.418
and they scrambled
out the window.

24:47.452 --> 24:49.552
Yeah, I used
my move-yourself power

24:49.585 --> 24:51.952
and got rid of them
just like that.

24:53.418 --> 24:55.785
SweetPea, you can have my ball.

24:55.819 --> 24:58.119
Sorry. I kicked yours
up to Marth.

24:58.152 --> 25:01.319
Kicked it to Marth?
Come on, that's impossible.

25:01.352 --> 25:03.119
Mm-hmm.

25:03.152 --> 25:05.086
Wow! Look!

25:05.119 --> 25:06.253
What is that?

25:06.286 --> 25:08.752
- Wow!
- Ooh!

25:16.452 --> 25:17.418
Stand back.

25:28.585 --> 25:30.318
Uh, hello.

25:30.352 --> 25:32.819
My name's Mega Lactic.

25:32.852 --> 25:33.885
- Who?
- What?

25:33.919 --> 25:35.286
Guys, what'd she say?

25:35.318 --> 25:38.286
I'm Mega Lactic.

25:38.318 --> 25:40.253
Hi, Mega Lactic.

25:40.285 --> 25:41.819
I'm SamSam.

25:41.852 --> 25:44.552
Hello, Mega.
I'm a little surprised.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.986
Nobody told me
you were joining our school.

25:47.019 --> 25:49.986
That's because my parents are on
a trip to another solar system.

25:50.019 --> 25:52.452
But they wrote you a letter.

25:52.485 --> 25:55.186
Wow! Your spaceship's
pretty awesome!

25:55.219 --> 25:56.385
Where are you from?

25:56.418 --> 25:58.385
Uh, really far away.

25:58.418 --> 26:02.785
Well then, Mega,
welcome to Cosmic Hero School.

26:02.819 --> 26:04.919
You can practice
your cosmic dance with Mega

26:04.952 --> 26:07.418
before we start our lessons.

26:07.452 --> 26:09.452
Hey, new girl,
you're like SamSam.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.119
You don't have any powers.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.285
I have tons of powers.

26:13.318 --> 26:15.919
So why aren't you
wearing any stars?

26:15.952 --> 26:19.552
I'm just too modest
to flaunt them, that's all.

26:19.585 --> 26:21.986
So what are your powers?

26:22.019 --> 26:24.819
It's a family secret.
I'm not allowed to say.

26:24.852 --> 26:27.119
Hey, everybody...

26:27.152 --> 26:30.485
there's no better way to make
friends than a cosmic dance.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.352
Yay!

26:46.452 --> 26:48.352
Come on, Mega, it's easy.

26:48.385 --> 26:50.385
Just let yourself go.

26:54.385 --> 26:56.518
Whoa, you need to loosen up.

26:56.552 --> 26:57.552
I can't dance.

26:57.585 --> 26:59.152
Okay, okay, chill.

26:59.186 --> 27:01.452
It's only the cosmic dance.

27:01.485 --> 27:03.452
I mean, whatever.

27:03.485 --> 27:05.052
Huh?

27:05.086 --> 27:08.218
If you like,
I could teach you the dance.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.318
Oh, yeah?
Why would you do that?

27:10.352 --> 27:12.418
Well, so we can be friends.

27:12.452 --> 27:14.952
You want to be my friend?

27:14.986 --> 27:17.452
Yes, so we can
help each other out.

27:17.485 --> 27:20.218
I'll teach you the cosmic dance,
and you can...

27:20.252 --> 27:21.385
I can what?

27:21.418 --> 27:23.418
You have a ton of powers,

27:23.452 --> 27:25.352
and I don't have any.

27:25.385 --> 27:27.852
I thought maybe you could
teach me how to find one.

27:27.885 --> 27:30.019
You mean, you help me
learn the dance,

27:30.052 --> 27:32.019
and I help you find a power?

27:32.052 --> 27:33.086
Cosmic deal?

27:33.119 --> 27:35.552
Okay, but on one condition.

27:35.585 --> 27:39.185
First the dance
and then the powers.

27:39.218 --> 27:42.785
It's strange.
Don't you ever smile?

27:42.819 --> 27:44.252
My father doesn't let me.

27:44.285 --> 27:46.518
He says,
"Smiling makes you ugly

27:46.552 --> 27:48.318
and laughing
gives you headaches."

27:48.352 --> 27:51.152
That's silly.
If we never laughed,

27:51.185 --> 27:54.552
we'd just be gloomy,
gray little things,

27:54.586 --> 27:56.485
as sad as stones.

27:58.318 --> 28:00.119
You smiled!

28:00.151 --> 28:01.452
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

28:01.485 --> 28:03.385
- Didn't.
- Did.

28:03.418 --> 28:04.852
Didn't!

28:15.819 --> 28:18.252
Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.
Guess what.

28:18.285 --> 28:19.785
I have a new friend at school.

28:19.819 --> 28:22.218
She has a ton
of mega-cosmic powers,

28:22.252 --> 28:24.952
and she's going
to help me find mine.

28:24.986 --> 28:28.086
SamSam, you know nobody else
can help you find your...

28:28.118 --> 28:30.285
I know, I know.
You always say that.

28:30.318 --> 28:33.086
"My powers are in me.
I'll find them myself."

28:33.118 --> 28:34.952
But it's different with Mega.

28:34.986 --> 28:37.518
It doesn't work like that
where she comes from,

28:37.553 --> 28:40.285
and she's going to help me.

28:41.952 --> 28:45.185
- I feel a bit out of my depth.
- You are, dear.

28:45.218 --> 28:49.185
Hey, by the way, will you be
using the ship tomorrow?

28:50.352 --> 28:51.318
Up!

29:03.085 --> 29:04.919
Mega, my dear,

29:04.952 --> 29:09.352
I want to hear all about your
first day at the School of Song.

29:09.385 --> 29:10.785
It was great.

29:12.586 --> 29:13.919
Tell me more.

29:13.952 --> 29:16.019
I learned to sing ahhs...

29:16.052 --> 29:17.819
and oohs...

29:17.852 --> 29:20.185
and even ooh-la-las.

29:20.218 --> 29:21.919
- Oh!
- Mother...

29:21.952 --> 29:24.285
there's a Marthian boy
in my class.

29:24.318 --> 29:26.385
I didn't know there were any.

29:26.418 --> 29:29.352
There aren't.
I mean, yes,

29:29.385 --> 29:32.352
there are some Marthian children
out in the galaxy,

29:32.385 --> 29:34.252
but not on Marth anymore.

29:34.285 --> 29:36.252
Your father asked them all
to leave.

29:36.285 --> 29:37.986
You know,
because of his headaches.

29:38.019 --> 29:41.352
What is this Marthian boy's
vocal repertoire?

29:41.385 --> 29:44.151
He does "Cosmic Song."
It's the new big thing.

29:44.185 --> 29:46.519
You should try it.

29:46.553 --> 29:49.486
For the time being,
practice your scales.

30:06.453 --> 30:08.418
Oh, I gotta go!

30:08.453 --> 30:10.385
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

30:13.252 --> 30:16.151
Hi, Mega.
Ready to trade?

30:16.185 --> 30:17.919
Dance for powers.

30:17.952 --> 30:20.085
Hmm.

30:20.118 --> 30:21.919
Let's do it.

31:50.885 --> 31:52.553
Wow! That really rocks.

31:52.586 --> 31:54.419
It makes me shake all over.

31:54.453 --> 31:56.085
It's funny you should say that

31:56.118 --> 31:58.885
'cause my parents say
I sing like a duck.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.985
Your home doesn't sound like
much fun. Try mine.

32:02.018 --> 32:06.218
You're all invited to
my birthday party on Saturday!

32:06.252 --> 32:07.486
- Yay!
- I'll be there.

32:07.519 --> 32:09.218
You'll come, won't you, Mega?

32:09.252 --> 32:11.486
Uh, to a Marthian home?

32:11.519 --> 32:13.819
Are you prejudiced?

32:13.852 --> 32:15.819
- No, not at all.
- So you'll come?

32:15.852 --> 32:18.085
Aye-aye, Marthial.

32:18.118 --> 32:20.252
Don't say that name.
Not even in fun.

32:20.285 --> 32:22.985
Now, children, make sure
you're on time tomorrow.

32:23.018 --> 32:24.353
We're going on a field trip

32:24.386 --> 32:27.151
to practice our cosmic powers
in outer space.

32:27.185 --> 32:28.486
- Yay!
- Hooray!

32:28.519 --> 32:30.519
- So cool!
- A space trip!

32:30.553 --> 32:33.519
Mega, this is awful.
What can I do?

32:33.553 --> 32:36.951
We haven't worked on my power,
not even once.

32:36.985 --> 32:39.051
Sorry, SamSam,
I can't just now.

32:39.085 --> 32:41.218
I promised my parents
I'd go straight home.

32:41.252 --> 32:43.085
You said they were away
on a trip.

32:43.118 --> 32:47.085
No. I mean yes, they were.
They're coming home today.

32:47.118 --> 32:50.218
So when will you help me?
Tomorrow before school?

32:50.252 --> 32:52.951
Okay, perfect.
Trust me, SamSam.

33:03.252 --> 33:05.386
I'm in deep trouble.

33:05.419 --> 33:08.486
How am I going to find a power
for SamSam and for me?

33:08.519 --> 33:10.486
I don't have any powers either.

33:10.519 --> 33:13.419
Help me, Chomper.
We have to think of something.

33:15.185 --> 33:16.151
You got it!

33:16.185 --> 33:17.519
<i>Good thinking, Chomper.</i>

33:17.553 --> 33:18.918
<i>He'll help me.</i>

33:18.951 --> 33:21.253
Hmmph! Mm-hmm.

33:32.151 --> 33:33.553
- Father.
- Mega!

33:33.586 --> 33:36.985
How was your day
at Dictator School, my dear?

33:37.018 --> 33:39.951
Very good, thank you.
Which reminds me,

33:39.985 --> 33:42.085
I have to give a presentation
on power tomorrow.

33:42.118 --> 33:44.453
Can you give me some ideas?

33:44.486 --> 33:46.085
Why, of course.

33:46.118 --> 33:49.785
Power is your daddy's specialty,
after all.

33:49.818 --> 33:52.085
My girl, it's time
you knew the truth.

33:52.118 --> 33:54.018
Truth? What truth?

33:54.051 --> 33:56.118
Follow me.

33:56.151 --> 33:58.219
<i>Who wants to go down?</i>

33:58.253 --> 34:02.253
Open up, stupid!
It's me, Marthial the First.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.518
Whoa! Aah!

34:26.286 --> 34:28.453
- What is this?
- This is where the cloud

34:28.485 --> 34:32.150
that keeps you
safely out of sight is made.

34:36.219 --> 34:39.485
It gets a teeny bit bumpy
from here on.

34:55.386 --> 34:56.553
Ouch!

34:56.585 --> 34:57.818
Stupid system.

34:57.851 --> 35:00.419
Mega, are you all right?

35:00.453 --> 35:02.519
Yes, but where are we?

35:02.553 --> 35:06.219
My power is here,
right behind this door.

35:06.253 --> 35:09.553
<i>By order of the great
King Marthial the First,</i>

35:09.586 --> 35:11.486
<i>identify yourself.</i>

35:11.519 --> 35:13.884
It's me, you pesky portal!

35:15.085 --> 35:18.519
Welcome to my secret laboratory.

35:22.985 --> 35:25.186
Hiya, Marthial.

35:26.386 --> 35:28.419
A brat!
A brat on Planet Marth!

35:28.453 --> 35:30.051
Don't be a child.

35:30.085 --> 35:34.119
I'm not. I'm not a child,
but she is.

35:34.152 --> 35:36.851
Mega? Her?
She's not a child.

35:36.884 --> 35:39.018
She's your future dictator.

35:39.051 --> 35:42.553
This way, my dear.
Watch and learn.

35:42.586 --> 35:45.985
Wettabeds.

35:46.018 --> 35:48.319
- Icky-sicks.
- Eww!

35:48.353 --> 35:50.386
Thingamaboobs.

35:50.419 --> 35:52.553
What are all these monsters for?

35:52.586 --> 35:54.353
For scaring children!

35:54.386 --> 35:57.186
To stop them laughing.

35:57.219 --> 36:01.085
Their horrid giggles
make my head explode.

36:01.119 --> 36:03.253
I have to protect myself.

36:03.286 --> 36:07.018
But my headaches will
soon be a thing of the past.

36:07.051 --> 36:11.486
Thanks to our new
super-powered monster...

36:11.519 --> 36:14.553
The fruit of years of toil
and research.

36:14.586 --> 36:16.818
The Spookadook!

36:19.152 --> 36:21.951
Do you really want
all children to be

36:21.985 --> 36:25.419
miserable, gray little things,
as sad as stones?

36:25.453 --> 36:28.486
Yeah, that's exactly
what I want.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.453
Help! It's kissing me!

36:42.486 --> 36:45.486
- Do something!
- Your Majesty, close your eyes.

36:47.486 --> 36:49.319
Holy smokes!

36:49.353 --> 36:52.152
That Kissy-wissy creature
wouldn't scare a fly!

36:52.186 --> 36:55.319
Not to worry, your Maj.
I'll tweak the formula.

36:55.353 --> 36:58.152
A bit less kissy,
a bit more scary.

36:58.186 --> 37:00.152
It's a winner.

37:00.186 --> 37:01.486
- What's that?
- That?

37:01.519 --> 37:03.018
Oh, that.

37:03.052 --> 37:05.985
It's my super
anti-monster spray.

37:06.018 --> 37:08.453
It turns monsters
into confetti.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.319
Daddykins?
Uh, Your Majesty,

37:12.353 --> 37:15.286
you really are the best dictator
in all the galaxy.

37:15.319 --> 37:16.818
Duh! I know.

37:16.851 --> 37:19.152
I'm gonna work
on my presentation now.

37:19.186 --> 37:20.553
See you Later.

37:20.585 --> 37:23.884
<i>Come again soon,
Miss Mega the First.</i>

37:25.219 --> 37:27.186
My daughter's a genius.

37:27.219 --> 37:30.818
All we have to do is
stop children laughing.

37:30.851 --> 37:34.253
Make 'em gloomy
forever and ever.

37:34.286 --> 37:37.286
Get working,
you spinach-haired geek.

37:37.319 --> 37:39.486
Not on my bottom!

37:48.918 --> 37:51.152
Are you sure
this is going to work?

37:51.186 --> 37:52.884
Don't I need to practice first?

37:52.918 --> 37:56.286
No need. Your power is in you.
You said it yourself.

37:56.319 --> 38:00.286
As soon as we see a monster,
do exactly what I tell you.

38:00.319 --> 38:03.286
Your power will come to you
all by itself.

38:03.319 --> 38:04.951
I don't like the black hole.

38:04.986 --> 38:08.219
Children, need I remind you
that no super powers

38:08.253 --> 38:10.219
can help you get out
of a black hole.

38:10.253 --> 38:13.519
Nothing has ever escaped
from one.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.353
Now concentrate

38:15.386 --> 38:17.453
because we're coming
to a cloud of Icky-sicks

38:17.486 --> 38:20.784
that escaped from
Marthial the First's stockpile.

38:20.818 --> 38:22.286
This is our exercise for today.

38:22.319 --> 38:24.851
I want you to use your powers
to get past them all

38:24.884 --> 38:27.219
without letting them
make you feel sick.

38:30.086 --> 38:31.453
Makeover rainbow!

38:37.286 --> 38:40.552
Wow! I don't get seasick!

38:40.585 --> 38:41.518
Wahoo!

38:43.219 --> 38:45.918
SamSam, shut your eyes
and concentrate.

38:45.952 --> 38:49.986
Now take a really deep breath
and repeat these cosmic words:

38:50.019 --> 38:52.486
monster-to-confetti.

38:52.518 --> 38:54.286
Monster-to-confetti.

38:54.319 --> 38:57.784
Louder! Concentrate harder.
And shut your eyes tighter.

38:57.818 --> 39:01.052
Monster-to-confetti!
Monster-to-confetti!

39:05.485 --> 39:07.485
Monster-to-confetti!

39:07.518 --> 39:09.952
Monster-to-confetti!

39:09.986 --> 39:11.386
You did it!

39:11.419 --> 39:13.353
I really did it?

39:15.052 --> 39:17.286
Minimize!
Minimize!

39:17.319 --> 39:18.919
Supersize!

39:18.952 --> 39:21.052
Oh, no!

39:28.086 --> 39:30.851
SamSam, I'm happy
you finally found

39:30.885 --> 39:32.885
your first power!

39:32.919 --> 39:37.452
What's more,
it's one I'd never heard of.

39:37.485 --> 39:38.986
Awesome!

39:39.019 --> 39:42.186
You guys can turn monsters
into confetti?

39:42.219 --> 39:44.919
Mega, you shared your power
with a friend,

39:44.952 --> 39:47.452
and that's the most cosmic
quality of all.

39:47.485 --> 39:50.219
You're both cosmic heroes now.

39:50.253 --> 39:53.119
- Friends?
- For life.

40:03.485 --> 40:07.353
Daddy, Mommy, SamTeddy!

40:07.386 --> 40:09.986
I did it! I got one!

40:10.019 --> 40:12.386
- One what?
- Oh, SamSam, it came?

40:12.418 --> 40:14.418
- You got your first power?
- Yes.

40:14.452 --> 40:17.952
- Well done, my little hero.
- So what is it?

40:17.986 --> 40:20.052
Monster-to-confetti.

40:20.086 --> 40:22.952
- Monster-to-confetti?
- What's that?

40:22.986 --> 40:24.319
It's all thanks to Mega,

40:24.353 --> 40:27.386
my mega-cosmic, mega-brilliant
new best friend.

40:27.418 --> 40:30.819
She taught me the magic words,
bing-bang-blllluh!

40:30.852 --> 40:33.019
The Icky-sicks
all turned into confetti.

40:33.052 --> 40:34.986
Monster-to-confetti?

40:35.019 --> 40:38.385
Well, your son has at least
one cosmic thing about him.

40:38.418 --> 40:41.152
- His imagination.
- True.

40:41.186 --> 40:44.819
I'm a real cosmic hero now,
thanks to Mega Lactic.

40:44.852 --> 40:46.353
Mega this, Mega that.

40:46.385 --> 40:48.152
Mega weird, if you ask me.

40:48.186 --> 40:51.518
Aw, come on. I don't need
a jealous teddy bear.

40:51.552 --> 40:54.919
In fact, I don't need
a teddy bear at all anymore.

40:54.952 --> 40:59.052
I'm a cosmic hero now.
Ha ha ha!

40:59.086 --> 41:01.353
I said no more teddies.

41:20.518 --> 41:21.819
Hello, GrannyPea.

41:21.852 --> 41:24.286
Oh, hello, SamSam.

41:24.319 --> 41:27.785
Let me see
that first star of yours.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.452
Splendid!

41:29.485 --> 41:32.885
SweetPea's expecting you.
Go join the party.

41:32.919 --> 41:34.086
Mega!

41:43.885 --> 41:45.052
Hi, SamSam.

41:45.086 --> 41:46.352
Hi.

41:53.318 --> 41:55.552
SamTeddy, what are you
doing here?

41:55.585 --> 41:58.052
I'm invited too,
in case you didn't know.

41:58.086 --> 42:00.919
- Hello, I'm Mega.
- I'm SamTeddy,

42:00.952 --> 42:04.086
SamSam's closest companion
and cosmic best friend.

42:04.119 --> 42:06.019
You still have a teddy bear?

42:06.052 --> 42:09.286
I had him when I was young,
but he's really clingy.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.253
He still follows me around.

42:11.286 --> 42:12.952
I live my own life.

42:12.986 --> 42:15.852
Guys, who's up for a slide?

42:15.885 --> 42:16.986
Great!

42:17.019 --> 42:19.119
Great!

42:19.152 --> 42:20.318
Yeah, I'm in.

42:20.352 --> 42:21.352
Let's go.

42:30.052 --> 42:31.219
Whoo-hoo!

42:35.452 --> 42:37.518
Hold tight, Mega.

42:37.552 --> 42:40.219
Whoo-hoo! Whee!

42:45.919 --> 42:49.452
Hmm. Someone who has
such a big rocket

42:49.485 --> 42:52.252
must have something big
to hide.

43:01.418 --> 43:03.152
Very interesting.

43:04.219 --> 43:05.518
Oh! What's that?

43:07.552 --> 43:09.852
Who are you?

43:12.385 --> 43:16.418
♪ SweetPea birthday to you
SweetPea birthday to you ♪

43:17.852 --> 43:20.485
Good health to you,
young Marthian.

43:20.518 --> 43:24.252
May your laughter
make Marthial's head split.

43:26.186 --> 43:27.186
Uh...

43:29.318 --> 43:31.986
It's a traditional saying
in the Pea family.

43:33.052 --> 43:35.919
Gather round, gather round!

43:35.952 --> 43:39.352
Shall I tell you what
Marthial the Meanie was like

43:39.385 --> 43:40.819
when he was young?

43:40.852 --> 43:41.885
Yes, GrannyPea!

43:41.919 --> 43:43.252
You knew my...

43:43.285 --> 43:44.819
You knew King Marthial
the First?

43:44.852 --> 43:46.518
Oh, yes.

43:46.552 --> 43:52.485
I was his nanny
for 663 years.

43:52.518 --> 43:57.252
Marthial was
a very merry little boy,

43:57.285 --> 44:00.052
always clowning
and prancing around

44:00.086 --> 44:02.485
to make his friends laugh.

44:02.518 --> 44:06.119
It's hard to believe now,
isn't it?

44:06.152 --> 44:08.052
Well, you see,

44:08.086 --> 44:12.518
some other children started
teasing him about his lisp,

44:12.552 --> 44:17.418
so young Marthial
turned in on himself,

44:17.452 --> 44:22.518
and over the years,
his sadness turned to anger,

44:22.552 --> 44:26.885
and his anger
turned into meanness.

44:26.919 --> 44:28.885
When he became king,

44:28.919 --> 44:33.485
he drove all the children away
from his planet.

44:33.518 --> 44:39.218
So I had to leave Planet Marth
with all my babies.

44:40.485 --> 44:44.785
It must be a very sad place now

44:44.819 --> 44:48.285
because a planet
without children's laughter

44:48.318 --> 44:50.852
is a planet without a heart.

44:50.885 --> 44:53.819
Yes! All sadness to Marthial,

44:53.852 --> 44:56.553
the nasty, silly dictator
of Marth.

44:56.586 --> 44:59.518
King Marthial the First
isn't nasty or silly.

44:59.553 --> 45:03.919
He's a good, strong,
sensible king!

45:04.986 --> 45:06.352
Huh?

45:09.952 --> 45:12.785
Uh, trust Mega
to come up with a joke.

45:12.819 --> 45:14.952
Uh, of course I was joking.

45:14.986 --> 45:18.418
Who would ever stick up
for silly old Marthial?

45:18.452 --> 45:20.418
Here's my present, SweetPea.

45:20.452 --> 45:22.252
SweetPea birthday.

45:22.285 --> 45:25.352
Nice box,
but what's the M for?

45:25.385 --> 45:28.151
Uh... M for Mega.

45:28.185 --> 45:31.118
Wow! It's my ball.

45:31.151 --> 45:35.218
SamSam, you told me you lost it
on Planet Marth.

45:35.252 --> 45:37.352
Where did you find it?

45:37.385 --> 45:39.819
Who cares?
It's only a gift.

45:39.852 --> 45:42.185
If you don't like it,
I'll take it back. No problem.

45:42.218 --> 45:45.318
Some things we can never forget.

45:45.352 --> 45:49.986
And this is the royal M
of Marthial the First.

45:50.019 --> 45:51.151
I'm positive.

45:54.285 --> 45:56.752
You're Marthial's sister?

45:57.852 --> 46:00.185
No! I'm his daughter.

46:01.285 --> 46:03.151
Mega, I'm confused.

46:03.185 --> 46:04.418
Who are you really?

46:04.452 --> 46:05.852
I'm Mega Lactic.

46:05.885 --> 46:07.852
I'm half-Marthian,
half-Saturnian.

46:07.885 --> 46:09.118
And a mega fibber.

46:09.151 --> 46:11.285
A mega dictator's daughter.

46:11.318 --> 46:13.019
Who plays mega-mean tricks.

46:13.051 --> 46:16.952
And is going right back
to her mega-mean daddy.

46:20.385 --> 46:22.919
SamSam, it's true.

46:22.952 --> 46:24.919
I am Marthial's daughter.

46:24.952 --> 46:27.019
But I'm also your friend.

46:27.051 --> 46:31.852
No, you're not.
Friends don't lie to each other.

46:31.885 --> 46:35.218
Oh, yeah?
Well, you know what?

46:35.252 --> 46:38.418
I'd rather be the real daughter
of a great dictator

46:38.453 --> 46:40.252
than a fake cosmic hero

46:40.285 --> 46:44.118
with a silly little cape
and a teddy bear.

46:55.852 --> 46:57.819
Are you okay, SamSam?

46:57.852 --> 47:00.819
No, I'm not.
Can't you understand some people

47:00.852 --> 47:02.852
just aren't as cosmic as you?

47:02.885 --> 47:06.185
Come on, SamTeddy.
We're leaving.

47:06.218 --> 47:09.352
SamTeddy? SamTeddy?

47:31.118 --> 47:35.453
Didn't I warn you
that children are nasty?

47:35.486 --> 47:37.085
You mean you...

47:37.118 --> 47:38.885
You know where I've been?

47:43.852 --> 47:45.952
You've been spying on me
all along?

47:45.985 --> 47:48.453
Correction.
I've been training you

47:48.486 --> 47:50.386
so that you'd see for yourself

47:50.419 --> 47:53.018
what mean little beasts
children are.

47:53.051 --> 47:58.085
They were mean to me,
and now they're mean to you.

47:58.118 --> 48:00.819
But thanks to your good advice,

48:00.852 --> 48:04.519
we're going to get
our revenge!

48:04.553 --> 48:07.919
But first, pull that bear out
from under the seat.

48:07.951 --> 48:09.051
Huh?

48:17.386 --> 48:18.951
SamTeddy, where are you?

48:18.985 --> 48:20.386
Hi, SamSam.

48:20.419 --> 48:23.252
We weren't sure how to tell you,
so take a look.

48:23.285 --> 48:26.852
Mega flew back to Marth?
As if I didn't know.

48:28.218 --> 48:30.453
SamTeddy?
What's he doing there?

48:30.486 --> 48:32.051
He may have had no choice.

48:32.085 --> 48:35.018
It's obvious to me.
Mega kidnapped him.

48:49.586 --> 48:51.985
SamTeddy,
I'll never abandon you.

49:04.985 --> 49:08.085
I tried your recipe
for cabbage with broccoli.

49:08.118 --> 49:11.486
It's not bad,
but I think a dash of spinach

49:11.519 --> 49:13.218
would give it more flavor.

49:13.252 --> 49:16.819
It could, but spinach
disagrees with me.

49:16.852 --> 49:18.752
- It gives me gas.
- Yeah, me too.

49:20.218 --> 49:21.453
Hey, it's the brat!

49:38.453 --> 49:40.118
What? Aah!

49:45.286 --> 49:46.519
Hello, SamSam.

49:46.553 --> 49:50.319
Oh, SamSam!
Good of you to drop in.

49:50.353 --> 49:51.951
Why did you kidnap SamTeddy?

49:51.985 --> 49:56.386
Ask him why he stowed away
on my rocket.

49:59.185 --> 50:02.151
Nastiness is such a tonic.

50:03.884 --> 50:06.151
I love special effects!

50:06.185 --> 50:09.851
Today is the greatest day
of my life.

50:09.884 --> 50:12.018
Thanks to Mega's advice,

50:12.051 --> 50:15.151
I've finally figured out
how to make a monster

50:15.185 --> 50:18.519
that will stop children laughing
forever and ever.

50:20.085 --> 50:23.884
All I have to do is turn you
into miserable,

50:23.918 --> 50:27.018
gray little things,
as sad as stones.

50:27.051 --> 50:29.918
Children will always laugh.

50:33.319 --> 50:35.851
Quiet!

50:37.553 --> 50:40.185
Laughing time is over.

50:40.219 --> 50:41.784
Behold!

50:41.818 --> 50:46.453
The devilish
Gloomyglob monster!

50:54.553 --> 50:58.253
The devilish Gloomyglob monster
is made of a mixture of...

50:58.286 --> 51:00.985
slug slime,
stingy toothpaste...

51:01.018 --> 51:01.985
sting...

51:02.018 --> 51:03.118
dead tree bark...

51:03.151 --> 51:04.118
bang...

51:04.151 --> 51:06.286
and moldy old car tires.

51:06.319 --> 51:09.918
It's easy to use
and extremely effective.

51:09.951 --> 51:12.085
It is attracted
to bright colors,

51:12.118 --> 51:16.151
such as cheerful clothes
and rosy cheeks.

51:16.186 --> 51:19.118
And then it bombards them
with gloomyglobs

51:19.151 --> 51:21.085
that gloomify them
on the spot.

51:21.118 --> 51:26.386
And from then on, all you brats
will sit around at home alone,

51:26.419 --> 51:28.386
staring at your screens.

51:28.419 --> 51:30.453
Goodbye, fun and games.

51:30.486 --> 51:33.118
Hello, grayness and gloom.

51:33.151 --> 51:34.918
But in order to work,

51:34.951 --> 51:37.186
it needs one more
tiny ingredient,

51:37.219 --> 51:39.784
which doesn't exist
on Planet Marth.

51:39.818 --> 51:41.386
The tear of a child.

51:41.419 --> 51:42.818
I'll never cry for you.

51:42.851 --> 51:45.851
You won't?
Then how will we manage?

51:45.884 --> 51:49.152
Who stings? We sting.
Who do we sting? You!

51:49.186 --> 51:52.118
If you think I'm scared
of your stupid bouncing blobs,

51:52.152 --> 51:53.186
you're wrong!

51:53.219 --> 51:54.519
Stupid, but stingy.

51:54.553 --> 51:57.486
Release all the Thingamaboobs!

51:57.519 --> 51:58.918
Stingy, stingy, stingy!

51:58.951 --> 51:59.918
Stop. Wait.

51:59.951 --> 52:02.386
I can make him cry.

52:03.985 --> 52:05.985
SamSam, dear,

52:06.018 --> 52:10.319
you really are the smallest
of the smallest cosmic heroes.

52:10.353 --> 52:12.219
You know what your friends say?

52:12.253 --> 52:14.486
They say if it weren't
for your parents,

52:14.519 --> 52:17.253
you wouldn't have been admitted
to Cosmic Hero School.

52:17.286 --> 52:18.884
Does it hurt
to hear the truth?

52:18.918 --> 52:20.851
Enough to make you cry?

52:20.884 --> 52:22.486
'Cause you're going to cry.

52:22.519 --> 52:28.018
And thanks to your tears,
no child will ever laugh again.

52:28.051 --> 52:30.319
But look on the bright side.

52:30.353 --> 52:35.419
No child will ever laugh at you
again either, SamSquirt.

52:35.453 --> 52:38.286
You're meaner than I would ever
have dared to imagine.

52:43.086 --> 52:44.951
Wonderful!

52:44.985 --> 52:48.286
Come to me, sad little drip.

52:51.486 --> 52:55.119
I may be the least cosmic person
in the universe,

52:55.152 --> 52:56.951
but if I cried,

52:56.985 --> 53:01.018
it would be because I lost my
best friend, a girl named Mega,

53:01.051 --> 53:03.419
who used to enjoy laughing
and dancing

53:03.453 --> 53:06.884
and singing with me
and all our friends.

53:06.918 --> 53:09.051
Who's a lucky monster?
You are!

53:09.086 --> 53:10.386
There!

53:17.419 --> 53:19.985
It's not supposed
to gloomify me.

53:20.018 --> 53:23.386
It can't, Your Marthialty...
uh, Majesty.

53:23.419 --> 53:27.286
Gloomyglobs
don't affect Marthians.

53:27.319 --> 53:28.985
Isn't that amazing?

53:29.018 --> 53:30.286
Yeah, fascinating.

53:30.319 --> 53:32.486
But I've got a child
to deal with.

53:32.519 --> 53:36.419
Gloomyglob monster,
gloomify that boy!

53:51.186 --> 53:52.186
Eww!

53:52.219 --> 53:53.219
Yes! What?

53:55.486 --> 53:56.419
Sabotage!

53:59.286 --> 54:00.386
Friends for life.

54:00.419 --> 54:01.818
Quick!

54:01.851 --> 54:03.152
Look out, Marthial!

54:03.186 --> 54:05.152
The little red devils
are getting away!

54:08.419 --> 54:10.052
Where did they go?

54:10.086 --> 54:14.386
Get moving and gloomify them
for badness sake!

54:22.851 --> 54:24.353
Halt!

54:25.951 --> 54:27.353
Whoa!

54:35.186 --> 54:36.884
SamSam, what are you doing?

54:36.918 --> 54:38.152
Monster-to-confetti!

54:39.253 --> 54:41.152
Confetti?

54:42.219 --> 54:44.286
Monster-to-confetti!

54:44.319 --> 54:45.986
Confetti?

54:48.152 --> 54:50.286
No! SamTeddy!

54:50.319 --> 54:52.519
I feel as sad as a stone.

54:55.884 --> 54:58.851
I don't understand.
Why isn't my power working?

54:58.884 --> 55:00.884
Because everything
that comes from Mega

55:00.918 --> 55:02.784
is a big, bad, ugly lie.

55:02.818 --> 55:06.186
I'm afraid you have
no power, SamSam.

55:10.219 --> 55:11.884
Confetti.

55:11.918 --> 55:14.419
You and your stink bombs
stay down there.

55:19.952 --> 55:22.818
Yikes! It's flying!
And super fast!

55:25.486 --> 55:27.486
I can't fly home

55:27.518 --> 55:30.386
or he'll follow us and gloomify
the whole Planet Sam.

55:30.419 --> 55:32.952
Just drop me off over there.

55:32.986 --> 55:35.486
Wait a minute.
Good idea!

55:35.518 --> 55:37.052
Hold tight, SamTeddy.

55:52.552 --> 55:56.386
I'm sorry to harp on,
but SamSam still isn't home.

55:56.419 --> 55:58.485
We agreed to trust him,
remember?

55:58.518 --> 56:01.919
But I'll check on him
just in case

56:01.952 --> 56:03.784
Locate SamSam.

56:03.818 --> 56:06.919
<i>Locating SamSam.
Please wait.</i>

56:06.952 --> 56:08.851
<i>SamSam located.</i>

56:08.885 --> 56:11.518
What's he doing
near the black hole?

56:11.552 --> 56:13.751
What? Oh, no!

56:32.452 --> 56:34.119
Confetti?

56:38.552 --> 56:40.952
- No!
- No.

56:40.986 --> 56:42.152
Oh, cheer up, my dear.

56:42.186 --> 56:43.784
We've lost our monster,

56:43.818 --> 56:46.286
but our scientists will go
right back to work.

56:46.319 --> 56:49.219
Get cracking! Build us
a new Gloomyglob monster.

56:49.253 --> 56:53.219
The day of wicked monsters
and gray little children

56:53.253 --> 56:55.818
is about to dawn.

56:57.186 --> 56:58.919
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

56:58.952 --> 57:01.052
Oh, I've given myself
a headache.

57:01.086 --> 57:02.319
Drat!

57:02.353 --> 57:05.518
Oh, I need my comfort song.

57:23.119 --> 57:24.952
There's SamSam!

57:24.986 --> 57:26.019
Yippee!

57:28.253 --> 57:29.253
SamSam!

57:32.518 --> 57:34.286
Are you all right?

57:34.319 --> 57:37.385
Where's your spacesuit?
There's a spare one back there.

57:37.418 --> 57:39.319
Mommy, you should have seen me.

57:39.353 --> 57:41.286
I trapped a big monster
in the black hole,

57:41.319 --> 57:45.152
and then I escaped by
leaving my costume in my saucer.

57:45.186 --> 57:47.353
He's attracted by colors.

57:49.353 --> 57:52.019
SamSam, you don't have
to tell tall stories

57:52.052 --> 57:53.319
to make us love you.

57:53.352 --> 57:54.952
- But...
- This one's true though.

57:54.986 --> 57:57.253
SamTeddy, you're all gray.

57:57.286 --> 57:59.852
SamSam's new friend did it.

58:04.253 --> 58:06.919
- Watch out!
- Cosmic shield!

58:09.152 --> 58:10.518
Maximize!

58:12.919 --> 58:14.852
- What's that?
- It's him.

58:17.119 --> 58:20.086
SamSam, is that your monster?

58:20.119 --> 58:21.418
It wasn't as big as that.

58:21.452 --> 58:23.785
Is that your cosmic suit
it has on?

58:23.819 --> 58:26.086
I left it in my saucer
to distract the monster.

58:26.119 --> 58:28.952
Your cosmic suit is designed
to fit whoever wears it.

58:28.986 --> 58:31.318
On a child,
it gives you basic powers,

58:31.352 --> 58:34.286
but on a monster like that,
it makes it invincible.

58:34.318 --> 58:37.052
None of our cosmic powers
will affect it.

58:37.086 --> 58:39.286
We'll need something else
to get rid of it.

58:39.318 --> 58:42.119
- Synchronize target!
- Synchronize target!

58:42.152 --> 58:44.286
I know how to make it go back
into the black hole.

58:44.318 --> 58:47.019
- Don't worry.
- SamSam, come back!

58:51.986 --> 58:52.952
Oh, no!

58:52.986 --> 58:54.019
Daddy, Mommy!

58:54.052 --> 58:55.318
Whatever.

58:55.352 --> 58:57.219
I'm tired of saving
the universe.

58:57.253 --> 58:59.119
Yeah, me too.
Come on, doll.

58:59.152 --> 59:02.253
Let's go home and sit around
eating taco chips.

59:02.285 --> 59:04.385
Confetti?

59:06.253 --> 59:07.285
Icicle-ize!

59:11.418 --> 59:13.819
Confetti!

59:13.852 --> 59:17.318
Whoa!

59:19.285 --> 59:22.086
You only score
when you're not playing.

59:22.119 --> 59:24.418
Isn't that sad?

59:26.186 --> 59:29.285
This new-style Gloomyglobosaurus
is amazing.

59:29.318 --> 59:30.986
Change of plan.

59:31.019 --> 59:33.385
You're going to build me
a mega anti-monster bomb.

59:33.418 --> 59:36.986
Negative! I take my orders
from King Marthial the First.

59:37.019 --> 59:40.186
You're going to learn to take
orders from Mega the First.

59:40.219 --> 59:42.852
I decide and you obey.

59:42.885 --> 59:45.086
Now get to work.

59:47.152 --> 59:48.986
Confetti?

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:24.986
Confetti?

01:01:20.586 --> 01:01:22.052
Oh, no.

01:01:25.052 --> 01:01:26.852
School's out forever.

01:01:26.885 --> 01:01:29.019
No one will ever
learn anything here again.

01:01:30.252 --> 01:01:31.418
Uh-oh.

01:01:31.452 --> 01:01:34.019
Confetti!

01:01:35.518 --> 01:01:38.452
Put me down right now,
you big brutey-woot,

01:01:38.485 --> 01:01:41.385
or I'll call my friend SamSam!

01:01:41.418 --> 01:01:44.986
Nuff of that.
Geronimo!

01:01:53.285 --> 01:01:55.819
SamMommy, SamDaddy, save me!

01:01:57.052 --> 01:01:59.019
Ask somebody else,
Mucky Yuck.

01:01:59.052 --> 01:02:01.151
We're too busy doing nothing.

01:02:04.452 --> 01:02:06.252
Confetti?

01:02:08.418 --> 01:02:10.318
- Move-yourself!
- This is awful.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:12.285
Should we go see
SamSam's parents?

01:02:12.318 --> 01:02:13.285
Wait, look!

01:02:13.318 --> 01:02:15.452
Now don't you worry.

01:02:15.485 --> 01:02:19.019
I'll mix up a nice drink
of stinky sock juice.

01:02:19.052 --> 01:02:21.052
- Where's SamSam?
- I don't know.

01:02:21.085 --> 01:02:23.485
Let's check
the soccabasket field.

01:02:42.352 --> 01:02:45.553
SamSam, there's a giant monster
attacking Planet Sam.

01:02:45.586 --> 01:02:47.318
A mega monster!

01:02:47.352 --> 01:02:49.118
I know.

01:02:49.151 --> 01:02:51.019
And it's going
to gloomify us all.

01:02:51.051 --> 01:02:53.352
So it isn't all
bad news then.

01:02:53.385 --> 01:02:55.085
We need to lure it to Marth.

01:02:55.118 --> 01:02:57.486
The Marthiantist is making
a bomb to destroy it.

01:02:57.519 --> 01:03:00.118
Are you sure it's not us you
want to lure there and capture?

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:02.051
And why should we trust you?

01:03:02.085 --> 01:03:05.952
Everything that's happened is
because of you and your lies.

01:03:05.986 --> 01:03:08.852
Hey, guys,
it's really our fault

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:11.118
because we all rejected her.

01:03:11.151 --> 01:03:13.252
I trust you, Mega.

01:03:13.285 --> 01:03:17.051
Thanks, SamSam,
but we'd better hurry before...

01:03:23.218 --> 01:03:25.252
Confetti?

01:03:26.418 --> 01:03:27.453
No!

01:03:27.486 --> 01:03:28.785
Ugh.

01:03:31.486 --> 01:03:33.352
No!

01:03:33.385 --> 01:03:34.952
Join the club.

01:03:34.986 --> 01:03:36.486
This can't be happening.

01:03:36.519 --> 01:03:39.185
Gloomyglobs aren't supposed
to affect Marthians.

01:03:39.218 --> 01:03:42.318
But you're half-Marthian,
half-whatever.

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:44.519
The grayness seems
to work slower on you.

01:03:47.885 --> 01:03:49.519
Run, guys!
I'll cover you.

01:03:49.553 --> 01:03:51.385
I'm 100% Marthian.

01:04:03.486 --> 01:04:06.218
Confetti!

Fathola dear,
did you see that?

01:04:17.419 --> 01:04:19.185
My monster, it's come back!

01:04:19.218 --> 01:04:21.519
And hasn't it grown?

01:04:26.453 --> 01:04:30.386
Marthial, why is your monster
chasing after our daughter?

01:04:36.586 --> 01:04:39.118
SamSam, look out.

01:04:44.386 --> 01:04:46.352
Oh, no, not the flowers!

01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:52.085
Yikes! I'm in for it now.

01:04:52.118 --> 01:04:54.519
Marthial, get off
your royal behind

01:04:54.553 --> 01:04:57.051
and go rescue our daughter
right now!

01:04:57.085 --> 01:04:58.951
Certainly!
Right away, Fathola dear.

01:04:58.985 --> 01:05:01.852
This is King Marthial
the First calling.

01:05:01.885 --> 01:05:03.519
Pulverize the monster!

01:05:03.553 --> 01:05:06.085
Launch all the rockets!

01:05:10.419 --> 01:05:13.453
Calling all squadrons.
Attack formation.

01:05:20.252 --> 01:05:21.918
Fire at will!

01:05:30.486 --> 01:05:32.852
Help!

01:05:32.885 --> 01:05:35.118
Holy smokes,
we're up against it.

01:05:35.151 --> 01:05:37.319
But don't worry.
I have another idea.

01:05:37.353 --> 01:05:39.085
My Marthiantist!

01:05:39.118 --> 01:05:40.453
Your Marth-what?

01:05:40.486 --> 01:05:43.852
Wait and see.
After you, Fathola dear.

01:05:49.319 --> 01:05:51.486
Quick!
Make an anti-monster bomb.

01:05:51.519 --> 01:05:53.918
What do you think
I'm making, cupcakes?

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:55.419
Aah! What's that?

01:05:55.453 --> 01:05:57.252
Huh? Oh, her? Ignore her.

01:05:57.285 --> 01:05:59.252
It's nobody.
She's only my wife.

01:05:59.285 --> 01:06:02.319
How's the battle going?

01:06:02.353 --> 01:06:04.353
What?

01:06:04.386 --> 01:06:06.985
What's that?

01:06:07.018 --> 01:06:09.151
Confetti?

01:06:14.453 --> 01:06:17.386
Confetti!

01:06:23.118 --> 01:06:24.918
Huh?

01:06:24.951 --> 01:06:27.453
A child. Catch them!

01:06:27.486 --> 01:06:29.353
Confetti?

01:06:33.819 --> 01:06:35.752
SamSam, quick.

01:06:38.586 --> 01:06:41.386
Brats!

01:06:46.851 --> 01:06:50.218
Aah! My rockets! My nose!
It's broken everything!

01:06:50.253 --> 01:06:52.486
Marthial, your nose
is irrelevant.

01:06:52.519 --> 01:06:55.018
When will this
anti-monster spray be ready?

01:06:55.051 --> 01:06:57.218
Abracadabra.

01:06:57.253 --> 01:06:59.253
An anti-gloomyglob monster bomb,

01:06:59.286 --> 01:07:02.353
made out of fizzy candy,
tickly feathers

01:07:02.386 --> 01:07:04.785
and Christmas cracker jokes.

01:07:04.818 --> 01:07:06.818
Isn't that amazing?

01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:09.985
Would you do the honors,
Madam Marthial the First?

01:07:10.018 --> 01:07:11.851
Oh, golly!

01:07:11.884 --> 01:07:14.085
Quick, Marthy, the video!

01:07:14.118 --> 01:07:16.286
Show some respect.

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:20.951
Now the roof, Your Maj.

01:07:28.051 --> 01:07:30.985
One little push
on the button and boom!

01:07:42.486 --> 01:07:47.051
Ah... ah... ah...

01:07:47.085 --> 01:07:48.519
Ah-choo!

01:07:48.553 --> 01:07:50.118
Aww...

01:07:51.519 --> 01:07:54.353
Holy smokes!
Your recipe doesn't work.

01:07:54.386 --> 01:07:56.784
It's gloomifying
my Marthians, too, now!

01:07:56.818 --> 01:07:58.353
Find me a solution
and be quick about it!

01:07:58.386 --> 01:08:00.553
No, no, I can't work
under this stress.

01:08:00.586 --> 01:08:04.419
Mother, Father, look.
I've changed color.

01:08:04.453 --> 01:08:07.884
I've always been sad,
but now it shows.

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:10.386
Mega, my darling child.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:14.051
Quick, cook up an antidote
for my daughter, lickety split!

01:08:14.085 --> 01:08:16.319
It looks more like
we need a cosmic hero.

01:08:16.353 --> 01:08:18.453
Confetti!

01:08:18.486 --> 01:08:21.051
Chomper, look after SamTeddy.

01:08:21.085 --> 01:08:22.818
Marthial, quick,
shut the lid.

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:26.018
Marthial.
I order you to obey SamSam.

01:08:26.051 --> 01:08:28.219
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Right away, right away!

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.185
Whoa!

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:45.850
Whoa!

01:08:45.884 --> 01:08:48.486
Confetti?

01:08:48.519 --> 01:08:50.486
Mommy! Whoa!

01:08:50.519 --> 01:08:51.453
- Ow!
- Oops.

01:08:54.586 --> 01:08:56.118
- Oops.
- Oops?

01:08:57.353 --> 01:08:58.850
- Whoops.
- Oops.

01:08:58.884 --> 01:08:59.984
Oops?

01:09:00.018 --> 01:09:02.051
Mega!

01:09:02.085 --> 01:09:04.118
Stay here.
I'll deal with this.

01:09:05.553 --> 01:09:08.085
Uh-oh. Stinger alert!

01:09:08.118 --> 01:09:10.286
♪ Pee-pee in their undies
Pee-pee in their beds ♪

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:11.553
Teddy gonna pee-pee!

01:09:11.586 --> 01:09:13.118
Don't touch my teddy!

01:09:14.386 --> 01:09:16.783
Aah! It's the deadly Kissybug.

01:09:18.818 --> 01:09:19.984
Mambo!

01:09:21.185 --> 01:09:22.783
Mambo?

01:09:31.118 --> 01:09:32.386
Aah!

01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:33.519
Stinga-butty!

01:09:33.553 --> 01:09:35.051
Aah!

01:09:35.086 --> 01:09:36.419
Stinga-stinga-stinga!

01:09:43.252 --> 01:09:45.917
I think I get it.

01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:48.783
To beat the monster,
we have to make it laugh.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.486
Who wants to wee-wee?

01:09:52.419 --> 01:09:54.185
Aaah!

01:09:54.219 --> 01:09:57.052
Teddy pee-pee!
Teddy bear pee-pee!

01:09:57.086 --> 01:09:58.386
Teddy bear pee-pee!

01:10:00.052 --> 01:10:01.353
Pee-pee Marthial!

01:10:01.386 --> 01:10:04.119
Oh ho ho ho!
Hee hee hee!

01:10:05.553 --> 01:10:07.519
Pee-pee, wee-wee!

01:10:07.553 --> 01:10:09.784
Whoa!

01:10:11.152 --> 01:10:12.386
Aaah!

01:10:16.018 --> 01:10:18.519
Waahh!

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:23.985
Mega, SamTeddy,
your colors are coming back.

01:10:24.018 --> 01:10:28.784
SamSam, quick!
Get the anti-monster sprays.

01:10:31.419 --> 01:10:33.319
Ah! Thanks, SamSam.

01:10:38.319 --> 01:10:40.553
Majesty,
we have to make it laugh.

01:10:40.585 --> 01:10:43.419
- I don't even know to be funny.
- Yes, you do.

01:10:43.453 --> 01:10:45.884
GrannyPea told us.
When you were a boy,

01:10:45.918 --> 01:10:48.386
you were always clowning around
and making people laugh.

01:10:48.419 --> 01:10:52.019
No, no, I can't.
It makes my head hurt.

01:10:52.052 --> 01:10:54.353
Yes, you can.
It's easy. Watch.

01:10:58.152 --> 01:11:00.119
It's working, SamSam.
Keep it up.

01:11:04.585 --> 01:11:06.086
Is that funny?

01:11:06.119 --> 01:11:08.119
I've got an idea.
Trust me.

01:11:08.152 --> 01:11:10.818
No, no, no!
Let me down! Let me down!

01:11:14.052 --> 01:11:16.219
SamSam, put me up again.

01:11:16.253 --> 01:11:20.552
Oh, no, not the cannonballs.
Not the cannonballs!

01:11:22.585 --> 01:11:24.186
You've got it, Your Majesty.

01:11:24.219 --> 01:11:25.918
- You're funny.
- Am I?

01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:27.286
- Catch!
- Huh?

01:11:27.319 --> 01:11:30.186
Not Icky-sicks.
They stink!

01:11:32.818 --> 01:11:35.186
It's working, SamSam!

01:11:35.219 --> 01:11:36.918
- Go for it, Dad!
- Hooray!

01:11:42.319 --> 01:11:44.152
Hmm? Ugh!

01:11:44.186 --> 01:11:47.552
My sock juice could do
with a few more boogers.

01:11:47.585 --> 01:11:49.419
Hee-yah!

01:11:49.453 --> 01:11:51.918
Hey, kids, everything okay?

01:11:54.986 --> 01:11:59.186
I'm grand and glorious
and powerful!

01:11:59.219 --> 01:12:00.419
SamSam, the lever.

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:05.186
But watch me now be laughable!

01:12:06.552 --> 01:12:08.986
Hooray!

01:12:21.851 --> 01:12:22.986
Confetti.

01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:26.485
Aah, SamSam, the monster!

01:12:26.518 --> 01:12:28.919
Yes, but it's teeny-weeny.

01:12:28.952 --> 01:12:30.851
I hate teeny-weeny things.

01:12:30.884 --> 01:12:32.186
Confetti.

01:12:32.219 --> 01:12:33.286
In you go!

01:12:33.319 --> 01:12:35.552
Yeah, about time too!

01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:37.286
Mega, darling.

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:39.119
Mommy.

01:12:39.152 --> 01:12:41.319
Hey, that's my scepter!

01:12:41.353 --> 01:12:44.119
SamSam, Daddy, you did it.

01:12:44.152 --> 01:12:46.518
Oh, my dictator girl.

01:12:46.552 --> 01:12:49.152
You've got your colors back.

01:12:53.585 --> 01:12:55.353
Are you quite finished?

01:12:55.386 --> 01:12:57.851
One itsy-bitsy monster,

01:12:57.885 --> 01:13:00.419
one tear of joy
from a dictator,

01:13:00.452 --> 01:13:02.818
and shazam!

01:13:02.851 --> 01:13:05.885
Goodbye dreary, hello cheery!

01:13:05.919 --> 01:13:07.919
Confetti!

01:13:07.952 --> 01:13:10.152
Cheery.
That's how I like you.

01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:13.552
SamSam, you're the greatest
cosmic hero of all.

01:13:13.585 --> 01:13:16.552
Thank you for rescuing
our little Mega.

01:13:16.585 --> 01:13:19.386
- Confetti.
- Marthial!

01:13:19.419 --> 01:13:21.552
Thank you, SamSam.

01:13:21.585 --> 01:13:23.885
Good job, SamSam.

01:13:30.885 --> 01:13:34.253
SamSam, you defeated
the most powerful monster

01:13:34.286 --> 01:13:35.818
in the universe.

01:13:35.852 --> 01:13:38.986
There was no ready-made
cosmic spell to do it.

01:13:39.019 --> 01:13:42.152
You had to find other,
better ways to beat it.

01:13:42.186 --> 01:13:47.019
You used courage, good thinking,
and above all, friendship.

01:13:47.052 --> 01:13:50.219
Friendship is
your first power, SamSam.

01:13:50.253 --> 01:13:54.019
- Hooray! Whoopee!
- Bravo!

01:13:54.052 --> 01:13:56.485
- Well done!
- Good job, SamSam!

01:13:56.518 --> 01:13:58.518
Thank you,
thank you, everybody.

01:13:58.552 --> 01:14:00.319
It's been a great adventure.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:03.819
This star is beautiful,
and I'm really glad to have it.

01:14:03.852 --> 01:14:08.019
But the next one will be
for a real mega cosmic power.

01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:11.485
Something tells me I might
get it today or tomorrow.

01:14:11.518 --> 01:14:13.353
Sometime soon, anyway.

01:14:13.385 --> 01:14:16.452
- Hooray! Whoopee! Bravo!
- Well done, SamSam!

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.784
