02:31.693 --> 02:33.695
Come on, Doc, dance with us.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.947
Oh, um... No.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.491
Lambie, there's something
I have to...

02:38.741 --> 02:40.535
Ooh, there is
something wrong!

02:40.827 --> 02:42.912
I didn't do it! Um...

02:43.204 --> 02:44.914
What is it
I didn't do again?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.916
I don't know,
but look at Doc's face.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.378
I know worried,
and that is a face
that is worrying.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.548
So, now I'm worrying.
Doc, what's going on?

02:54.215 --> 02:57.010
Well, sassy sunshine,
the snowman is right.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.595

tell us anything, Doc.

to show you something.

Doc, what happened?

03:29.834 --> 03:33.212
Lambie, I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.465
We were dancing
in the living room,

03:35.548 --> 03:37.175
and I was
spinning you around,

03:37.800 --> 03:40.053
and you got caught
on something.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.179
Oh...

03:41.262 --> 03:43.014
Do you forgive me?

03:45.642 --> 03:47.644
Of course,
I forgive you, Doc.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.979
I know you'd never hurt me
on purpose.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.776
I wouldn't.
And thanks, Lambie.
I feel awful about this.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.947
You're my best friend,
and I totally forgive you.

03:59.822 --> 04:03.368
But, could we fix this?
Maybe now?

04:04.285 --> 04:05.536
I'm on it, Lambie.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.497

04:18.882 --> 04:19.841
[Doc] Hmm...

04:19.926 --> 04:21.636
I don't like
the sound of that.

04:21.761 --> 04:25.974
I can't find a loose thread
that I can use to pull
Lambie's rip closed.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.768
Okay, I don't like
the sound of that!

04:29.102 --> 04:31.187
[sighs] What's wrong, Doc?

04:31.521 --> 04:35.858
Your rip isn't going
to be as easy to close
as I thought.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.903
It's okay, Doc.
You don't have
to be embarrassed

04:38.987 --> 04:40.488
to ask for a little help.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.365
I'm sure I can think
of something.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.367
Oh! How about
we use some tape?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.035
Uh... I don't think...

04:46.119 --> 04:47.870
Chilly, there's
some tape on my desk.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.622
Can you bring it
on in here?

04:50.039 --> 04:50.957
[clattering]

04:51.040 --> 04:52.041
Here's the tape.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.546

but now it's gone!

05:07.015 --> 05:08.891
Chilly, you're not
growing anything.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.102
You and Squeakers
are taped together.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.895

Oh...

05:13.021 --> 05:15.315
I guess that explains
where the tape went.

Please?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.992

-[Doc] Lambie, I think
that you need--
-How about these?

05:52.727 --> 05:55.313
Oh, Stuffy.
I don't think that...

05:55.396 --> 05:59.067
You've ever heard
a more brilliant idea?
I know.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.280
You look fabulous!

06:06.657 --> 06:08.326
Work it! Work it!

06:10.203 --> 06:11.496
Ooh! Take cover!

06:11.913 --> 06:15.833
This isn't working.
Doc, I need you.

06:17.085 --> 06:21.297
But, Lambie, there's only
one way I can think of
to fix your rip.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.591
Well, what is it?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.218
You need stitches.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.469
[all gasp]

06:26.552 --> 06:27.762
I can't listen!

06:28.179 --> 06:30.556
Are you sure
that's the only way?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.058
I'm sure.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.394
Sometimes,
when a cut is really big
or really deep,

06:35.728 --> 06:38.272
we have to hold it together
with something like thread.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.775
It's the only way
for it to heal well.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.153
I know it's scary.
But, when we're done,

06:44.529 --> 06:46.197
you're going
to be good as new.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.908
You'll barely be able
to see it was ever there.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.368
Are you sure?

06:50.827 --> 06:53.871
Yep. You know,
I got stitches once.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.124
You did? Where?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.584
Right here on my finger.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.878
I fell and cut it on a rock.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.548
Oh, I can hardly see it.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.217
Your scar is kind of cute.

07:06.676 --> 07:10.471
I know!
That's because I got stitches
when I needed them.

07:11.722 --> 07:16.769
Okay, do it if you must!
[sighs] I'm ready!

07:17.270 --> 07:18.104
Oh...

07:18.187 --> 07:20.731
Lambie.
I can't do the stitches.

07:20.815 --> 07:21.983
You can't?

07:22.066 --> 07:23.818
No. I can't sew.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.487
So, we're going to have
to see a specialist.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.239
Oh! I'm pretty special.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.366
I'd be happy
to stitch you up, Lambie!

07:32.076 --> 07:33.453
[grunting]

07:37.123 --> 07:39.000
Just give me a sec.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.629
Don't worry.
Stuffy's not going to do it.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.757
-Oh, good!
-I think we need
to see my mom.

07:46.841 --> 07:50.553
She's a doctor,
and really, really good
at taking care of kids

07:50.887 --> 07:52.096
and stuffed animals.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.556
As good as you?

07:54.015 --> 07:54.849
Definitely.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.226
I wouldn't take you
to her if she wasn't.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.769
Will you be with me?

07:59.020 --> 08:03.608
Of course. I'll be
right there holding your paw
the whole time.

08:04.233 --> 08:08.321
Okay then. [sighs]
I guess we should go.

08:08.738 --> 08:13.034
Doc won't let
anything happen to you.
She loves you. We all do.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.244
Thanks, Stuffy.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.413
Bye, everyone.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.707
[Stuffy] Don't be scared.
[Hallie] Feel better,
little lamb.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.585
Oh, is she done
talking about yicky stuff?

08:23.503 --> 08:24.962
Oh! Bye!

08:27.048 --> 08:30.176
I'm talking
too loud, right?
[chuckles]

08:32.511 --> 08:36.307
You ready? I promise,
I'll be right here.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.730
Mom, I need your help.

08:43.313 --> 08:44.732
Sure, sweetie. What is it?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.568
I have a kinda hard case.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.779
Hmm. Let me take a look.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.323
Oh, I see Lambie's got a rip.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.534
We'll have to sew
that right up.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.118
That's what I thought.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.079
Let's do it in my office.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.623
This should be no problem.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.834
I just have to find
the right thread,
and we'll sew...

09:04.210 --> 09:06.837
I mean, stitch Lambie
right back up.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.175
[gasps] Doc, I'm scared.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.594
I know.
Do you need a cuddle?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.557

09:17.848 --> 09:20.059

10:14.947 --> 10:16.824
Going stuffed now.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.995
Okay, kiddo.
Let's get Lambie fixed up.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.207
Great. And be careful, okay?

10:26.083 --> 10:28.502
Lambie's really special,
you know?

10:29.378 --> 10:33.758
I know. And sweetie,
I promise she'll be
as good as new.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.636
Doc, I'm going
to need you to assist.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.430
Just hold the sides
of the rip together.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.099
Great!

10:43.893 --> 10:45.561
That should do it.

10:45.936 --> 10:46.937
Ah.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.315
Wow. Nice work.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.110
I can barely see
where the rip was.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.445
Thanks, Mom.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.031
I couldn't have done it
without you, Doc.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.699
We make a pretty great team.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.787
Now, would you
take the patient
to the recovery room

11:02.995 --> 11:05.164
and watch after her
till she's feeling better?

11:05.539 --> 11:06.624
I sure will!

11:10.503 --> 11:11.796
How'd it go, Doc?

11:11.879 --> 11:13.005
Great.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.301
Is it over?

11:17.551 --> 11:18.552
Yep.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.054
Come on. Turn around.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.684
You used pink thread.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.646
Oh!
I can barely see it!

11:29.021 --> 11:30.064

11:30.147 --> 11:33.442

It's baa-utiful!

Henry, I can't hear you

Can you hear me?

No! My walkie-talkie's
not working.

making a weird noise.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.419
I've got spy goggles

And whoody-who do we have
for a checkup today?

13:37.858 --> 13:40.319
Oh, I didn't bring
any broken toys with me.

just hang out
with her best friends?

[Chilly] Yes, you can!
[Lambie] Of course!

14:03.008 --> 14:03.968
Aah!

14:04.093 --> 14:05.469
What's wrong, Chilly?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.055
There's something out there!

14:10.099 --> 14:11.809
I don't see anything.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.937
Oh. I could have sworn
I saw something.

Why, Gracie! My other half!

are you in there?

Gracie, can you
hear me, sweetheart?

15:05.112 --> 15:09.325
Um, excuse me.
I'm Doc, and you're...

15:09.783 --> 15:10.951
Walter. The name's Walter.

15:11.327 --> 15:15.122
Walter. I'm Doc McStuffins.
Everyone calls me Doc.

Gracie's my better half!

When I talk, she listens.
When she talks, I listen.

15:26.508 --> 15:30.387
Oh, right,
you're walkie-talkies.
She must be the other one.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.140
Yeah, and I'm useless
without her.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.267
But I can't find her!

15:35.351 --> 15:38.395
Donny was playing with us,
but when he stopped,
Gracie was...

15:39.104 --> 15:40.272
Gracie was gone.

It's this piece.

18:09.963 --> 18:13.425
Both walkie-talkies

from far away.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.512
Walter is missing
his antenna,

18:17.054 --> 18:21.350

Walter's antenna could have
fallen off anywhere,

21:55.897 --> 21:58.567
Doc and these fine folks
helped me get my antenna back,

21:58.650 --> 22:00.360
so we could hear
each other again.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.197
Thank you for bringing
my Walter back to me!

22:04.865 --> 22:06.074
You're welcome!

22:08.660 --> 22:09.786
[Donny giggles]

22:17.919 --> 22:21.590
Special Agent Hedgehog,
I spy our target!

22:22.591 --> 22:24.801
Me, too! Let's get closer!

22:25.177 --> 22:26.887
[leaves rustling]

22:27.054 --> 22:28.930
Quick! Everyone, go stuffed!

22:34.352 --> 22:35.353
[both] Gotcha!

22:35.979 --> 22:38.815
You got me all right!
Never saw you coming!

22:39.232 --> 22:41.860
Whew! Good thing that
we had our spy goggles!

22:42.069 --> 22:43.361
Definitely!

22:43.487 --> 22:45.280
You might want
to try these, too!

22:45.655 --> 22:50.077
Hey! Cool! Walkie-talkies
and spy goggles.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.204
We can spy on anyone!

22:52.662 --> 22:53.830
But wait, they don't...

22:54.206 --> 22:55.082
Just try 'em.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.668
Special Agent Hornet,
the walkie-talkies are fixed.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.922
I repeat.
The walkie-talkies
are fixed!

23:02.380 --> 23:04.424
Awesome! Thanks, Doc!

23:04.716 --> 23:06.218
Let's go spy on my dad.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.762
Cool! Thanks!

23:10.680 --> 23:14.059
Special Agent Hornet,
I see my dad!

23:14.142 --> 23:15.060
[snores]

23:15.143 --> 23:17.854
[Donny]
Let's sneak up on him!
Do you read?

23:18.855 --> 23:19.856
[chuckles]

23:19.940 --> 23:22.526
I read you loud and clear!

23:23.693 --> 23:24.945
[leaves rustling]

23:25.112 --> 23:26.238
[snoring]

23:26.488 --> 23:28.365
[Donny yells]
Whoa!

23:28.532 --> 23:30.158
[all laughing]

23:32.953 --> 23:34.746
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:35.705 --> 23:38.041
<span style="style.default_1">To keep from spreading germs</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to your friends,</span>

23:38.125 --> 23:39.584
[squeaking]

23:40.210 --> 23:41.211
<span style="style.default_1">what should you do?</span>

23:42.212 --> 23:43.713
<span style="style.default_1">Wash your hands?</span>

23:45.340 --> 23:46.341

23:47.843 --> 23:48.969
[groans]

23:49.302 --> 23:51.012
<span style="style.default_1">-Or have a tickle fest?</span>
-[all laughing]

23:53.640 --> 23:56.059
<span style="style.default_1">That's right!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Wash your hands.</span>
