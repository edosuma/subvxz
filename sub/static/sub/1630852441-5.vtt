00:14.625 --> 00:15.625
Come on!

00:16.208 --> 00:20.375
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-The party's just begun</i>

00:20.458 --> 00:23.916
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-Maths is so much fun</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:24.833
All right!

00:24.916 --> 00:27.041
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-Everyone</i>

00:27.125 --> 00:29.291
<i>-Party!</i>
<i>-Maths is fun</i>

00:29.375 --> 00:30.625
<i>We're the babies</i>

00:30.708 --> 00:32.083
<i>You're the big kids</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:35.416
<i>Teach us all the maths you know</i>
<i>One, two, three, let's go</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:36.333
<i>Zu ba!</i>

00:36.416 --> 00:37.750
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:37.833 --> 00:39.833
<i>The party's just begun</i>

00:39.916 --> 00:45.208
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-This party's number one!</i>

00:45.291 --> 00:46.791
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:55.458 --> 00:59.208
<i>The babies are ready</i>
<i>to wake up from their naps.</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:02.916
<i>But wait. Where are the babies?</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:07.750
Peek-a-pop!

01:08.708 --> 01:12.166
-We surprised you.
-We already woke up.

01:12.250 --> 01:15.125
And we're making a plan for playtime.

01:15.208 --> 01:20.416
I have these really pretty beads
to make friendship bracelets.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.541
That's because we are all friends.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.166
-Pretty, pretty colours.
-Yeah.

01:27.250 --> 01:29.750
Green! That's my favourite colour.

01:29.833 --> 01:33.750
My favourite is purple. See?

01:33.833 --> 01:35.208
I like blue.

01:35.291 --> 01:38.708
Oh, yeah. Blue is nice. But, oh, green.

01:38.791 --> 01:39.958
Oh, purple.

01:40.541 --> 01:43.291
What's your favourite colour, big kids?

01:45.041 --> 01:48.041
<i>What's your favourite colour?</i>
<i>I'm asking you</i>

01:48.125 --> 01:51.666
<i>Clap two times</i>
<i>If your favourite colour's blue</i>

01:52.666 --> 01:54.000
<i>Blue!</i>

01:54.083 --> 01:57.250
<i>What's the nicest colour you've ever seen?</i>

01:57.333 --> 02:00.750
<i>Clap and dance</i>
<i>If your favourite colour's green</i>

02:01.625 --> 02:02.708
<i>Green!</i>

02:02.791 --> 02:06.000
<i>Is your favourite colour orange?</i>
<i>I'm asking you</i>

02:06.083 --> 02:09.583
<i>Clap and dance if you love orange too</i>

02:10.625 --> 02:11.791
<i>Orange!</i>

02:11.875 --> 02:14.916
<i>The colours of the rainbow</i>

02:15.000 --> 02:21.083
<i>-Are all so beautiful to me</i>
<i>-The colours of the rainbow</i>

02:21.166 --> 02:25.541
<i>Are so beautiful to see</i>

02:25.625 --> 02:26.958
<i>Colours!</i>

02:27.041 --> 02:28.416
<i>Colours!</i>

02:28.500 --> 02:29.875
<i>Colours!</i>

02:29.958 --> 02:31.458
<i>Colours!</i>

02:32.375 --> 02:33.208
So cool!

02:33.291 --> 02:35.625
<i>Green! Blue! Don't forget red!</i>

02:35.708 --> 02:38.083
<i>The colours of the rainbow</i>

02:38.166 --> 02:43.250
<i>Are all so beautiful to me!</i>

02:43.333 --> 02:45.750
The song is done, Kippie.

02:48.583 --> 02:49.833
Clickety Clock!

02:51.083 --> 02:54.000
We know, Clickety. It's time to play!

02:54.083 --> 02:58.000
-Let's go! Cheetah speed!
-Yeah! Let's go!

02:58.083 --> 03:02.958
But first,
let's give the big kids some kisses.

03:03.041 --> 03:03.958
One.

03:05.875 --> 03:06.791
Two.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.500
Three.

03:12.333 --> 03:16.083
<i>Yī, èr, sān.</i>

03:16.708 --> 03:19.333
Three kisses for you.

03:20.458 --> 03:21.458
Let's go!

03:23.750 --> 03:25.166
Okay.

03:25.250 --> 03:31.958
To make bracelets, you just slide beads
onto the string, one after another.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.208
Like this!

03:36.291 --> 03:39.166
I want to do it! Me!

03:42.291 --> 03:45.750
Let's use all purple beads!

03:45.833 --> 03:47.166
<i>Zsè.</i>

03:47.250 --> 03:50.666
No. I want to use all green beads.

03:50.750 --> 03:51.750
<i>Lsè.</i>

03:52.500 --> 03:57.125
Well, our friendship bracelets
should look exactly the same.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.416
-Right?
-I think that's right.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.333
<i>Shì.</i>

04:00.416 --> 04:03.791
Well, then, all green beads.

04:03.875 --> 04:06.125
No! All purple beads.

04:06.208 --> 04:07.750
No. Green.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.333
-Purple!
-Green.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.708
-Purple!
-Green!

04:10.791 --> 04:11.958
-Purple!
-Green.

04:15.083 --> 04:18.833
Let's not fight. It's not nice to fight.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.125
Okay. But just to tell you,

04:22.625 --> 04:26.166
I don't want to make
friendship bracelets any more,

04:26.250 --> 04:30.125
because Kip is not my friend.

04:30.625 --> 04:31.750
What?

04:31.833 --> 04:32.958
What?

04:35.041 --> 04:37.375
Well… Well, that's okay,

04:37.458 --> 04:41.791
because I also don't want
to make friendship bracelets any more,

04:41.875 --> 04:45.541
because, well, Lulu is not my friend.

04:46.041 --> 04:47.250
What?!

04:47.333 --> 04:48.416
What?!

04:53.458 --> 04:55.708
Wait. Kip, don't…

04:56.958 --> 05:00.500
Now we really need
these friendship bracelets.

05:00.583 --> 05:01.708
Yeah.

05:03.416 --> 05:09.416
Okay. We've got to use colours
that both Kip and Lulu like.

05:09.500 --> 05:14.250
Right. And we need the same number
of beads in the same order.

05:14.333 --> 05:15.166
Oh yes.

05:15.250 --> 05:19.000
So it needs to be something like this
or that or…

05:20.500 --> 05:22.958
I'm not sure what I'm drawing.

05:24.541 --> 05:28.041
But wait, did you say "number"?

05:28.791 --> 05:29.625
Yeah.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.125
This is a maths problem!

05:34.208 --> 05:37.375
Maths Molly!

05:40.291 --> 05:45.083
Come on! We've got to go
and get Kip and Lulu! Let's go!

05:47.041 --> 05:50.416
Noodles, you're my friends.

05:50.916 --> 05:54.000
You like purple, don't you?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.625
You're nice.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.500
Wait! Where are you going, noodles?

06:08.916 --> 06:12.625
Lulu, come on! We're going to fix
this friendship problem.

06:12.708 --> 06:14.416
Maths Molly will help.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.250
Okay.

06:17.250 --> 06:18.375
Bye, noodles.

06:18.875 --> 06:20.958
But I'm not talking to Kip!

06:24.875 --> 06:29.833
You're my friend, star pillow.
You like green beads, right?

06:29.916 --> 06:33.791
Yeah. You're a good listener.
Not like that--

06:36.291 --> 06:37.583
Kip!

06:38.500 --> 06:39.583
Come with us!

06:39.666 --> 06:43.375
We're going to fix this,
and Maths Molly will help.

06:43.458 --> 06:46.500
Well, okay,
but I'm still not talking to Lulu!

06:46.583 --> 06:47.416
Come on.

06:51.958 --> 06:55.416
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

06:57.916 --> 07:02.000
A friendship problem.
The most important kind.

07:02.583 --> 07:05.500
And we really need your help.

07:10.500 --> 07:15.250
That's one, two, three, four.
Four green beads.

07:15.333 --> 07:18.916
Yeah, green. The best colour.

07:23.583 --> 07:28.208
And that's one, two, three, four.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.750
Four purple beads.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.833
Pretty, pretty purple.

07:33.916 --> 07:35.500
The best.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.958
Look! Green, purple,

07:44.041 --> 07:46.708
green, purple,

07:46.791 --> 07:49.625
green, purple!

07:49.708 --> 07:52.291
Yeah. It's always the same order.

07:52.916 --> 07:55.333
Big kids, what's that called?

07:58.250 --> 07:59.708
<i>A pattern.</i>

08:01.000 --> 08:02.500
What's a pattern?

08:02.583 --> 08:08.125
<i>Babies, a pattern is when the order</i>
<i>of something repeats based on a rule.</i>

08:08.791 --> 08:13.791
So, the rule here is green, then purple,

08:13.875 --> 08:16.250
green, then purple,

08:16.333 --> 08:18.458
over and over again.

08:18.541 --> 08:23.000
So, if we use this pattern
for our bracelets,

08:23.083 --> 08:26.791
there would be green and purple beads?

08:26.875 --> 08:29.291
And the same number of each.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.208
-I like that!
-I like that!

08:32.291 --> 08:34.375
-You like that?
-You like that?

08:34.458 --> 08:35.500
-Yes!
-Yes!

08:37.000 --> 08:40.041
So, are you friends again?

08:42.208 --> 08:47.875
I'm sorry, Kip. You are my bestest,
better-than-noodles friend.

08:48.833 --> 08:53.625
I'm sorry, Lulu. You're my bestest,
better-than-stars friend.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.250
Now we can make our friendship bracelets!

09:03.833 --> 09:05.833
But first…

09:05.916 --> 09:09.833
-Maths Party!
-Yeah!

09:11.750 --> 09:13.166
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:13.250 --> 09:14.666
<i>We did math</i>s

09:14.750 --> 09:16.833
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:17.750 --> 09:20.666
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

09:20.750 --> 09:24.125
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

09:24.208 --> 09:25.041
Yeah!

09:25.125 --> 09:26.750
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:26.833 --> 09:28.166
<i>We did maths</i>

09:28.250 --> 09:30.500
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:31.166 --> 09:33.833
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

09:33.916 --> 09:38.666
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

09:38.750 --> 09:41.291
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

09:41.375 --> 09:44.291
<i>We love maths!</i>

09:49.458 --> 09:50.791
All done!

09:52.541 --> 09:56.250
Friendship bracelets made with a pattern,

09:56.333 --> 10:00.750
one purple, one green,
then again and again.

10:00.833 --> 10:04.500
-Five bracelets.
-For five friends.

10:05.375 --> 10:06.583
-One.
-Two.

10:06.666 --> 10:08.375
-Three.
-Four.

10:08.458 --> 10:09.833
Five!

10:11.041 --> 10:15.125
We're five friends again.
Can we play the five babies game?

10:15.208 --> 10:17.541
-Yes!
-Can we? Right now!

10:17.625 --> 10:20.666
Let's take off our bracelets
so we don't break them.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.875
Okay. Good idea, Franny.

10:24.125 --> 10:27.916
-There. Safe and sound.
-Pretty, pretty bracelets.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.416
Let's go hop, skip and slide!

10:33.958 --> 10:35.500
<i>Five babies hopping</i>

10:35.583 --> 10:37.875
<i>Hop-hop-hopping round a tree</i>

10:38.750 --> 10:40.958
<i>Kip hop-hoppity hops away</i>

10:41.041 --> 10:42.583
Look! A bumblebee!

10:43.583 --> 10:47.625
<i>Four babies tapping</i>
<i>Tap-tap-tapping on our knees</i>

10:48.541 --> 10:53.083
<i>Let's all get a snack in</i>
<i>Pass the ice cream please</i>

10:53.166 --> 10:55.333
<i>Tilly leaves to take a bath</i>

10:55.416 --> 10:57.291
<i>Now we're only three</i>

10:57.958 --> 11:02.041
<i>Three babies skipping</i>
<i>Skip-skip-skipping on their toes</i>

11:02.625 --> 11:06.750
<i>Skipping round the garden</i>
<i>Bailey stops to smell a rose</i>

11:06.833 --> 11:11.541
<i>So now there's two babies sliding</i>
<i>Slide-slide-sliding down a slide</i>

11:12.333 --> 11:16.375
<i>-Lulu keeps on sliding</i>
<i>-Franny takes off for a ride</i>

11:16.458 --> 11:17.291
See you later!

11:17.375 --> 11:21.125
<i>One baby dancing</i>
<i>Dance with Raffe round the room</i>

11:21.833 --> 11:25.750
<i>Everybody join the fun</i>
<i>So I'm not the only one</i>

11:25.833 --> 11:26.666
Come on!

11:26.750 --> 11:30.750
<i>One, two, three, four, five</i>
<i>Count, everyone</i>

11:31.541 --> 11:35.708
<i>-Five, four, three, two, one</i>
<i>-And now we're done</i>

11:38.500 --> 11:40.791
Not really. We're not done.

11:40.875 --> 11:43.375
-We're right here!
-Hi, big kids!

11:43.458 --> 11:47.083
Thanks for helping us
make friendship bracelets today.

11:47.166 --> 11:50.000
You are our bestest, better-than-noodles…

11:50.083 --> 11:51.666
Better-than-stars…

11:51.750 --> 11:53.500
Friends!

12:01.833 --> 12:04.583
<i>The babies are having a dance party today.</i>

12:06.666 --> 12:09.791
And I'm painting them while they dance.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.708
But everyone keeps moving.

12:15.958 --> 12:18.500
Pretty, pretty pattern.

12:19.208 --> 12:23.208
Orange, green, purple.

12:23.291 --> 12:27.375
Orange, green, purple.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.208
Yep. It's a pattern.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.250
Hey, Lulu. Let's make up new dances.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.541
-Okay.
-This one's called The Wallaby Hop.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.041
Okay, watch this.

12:37.125 --> 12:40.666
Hop, hop, spin!

12:41.458 --> 12:45.250
Hop, hop, spin!

12:46.708 --> 12:49.125
-Lulu has a dance too.
-Oh yeah?

12:49.208 --> 12:51.125
It's The Funky Noodle.

12:53.041 --> 12:56.125
One slide and two wiggles.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.958
One slide and two wiggles.

13:00.875 --> 13:02.541
You try it, Tilly.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.416
You're dancing.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.666
Tilly's got the moves!

13:14.458 --> 13:16.041
Dance, Tilly, dance!

13:19.041 --> 13:22.750
All that dancing made me hungry.

13:24.083 --> 13:28.333
That's good, because Cookitybot's here.
It's snack time!

13:32.958 --> 13:33.791
Let's see.

13:33.875 --> 13:38.541
One, two, three, four, five.

13:39.041 --> 13:43.375
-Five blueberry muffins for five babies.
-Yum!

13:43.458 --> 13:45.666
-Thanks, Cookity.
-Thank you.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.041
Wait.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.458
One, two,

13:50.541 --> 13:53.500
three, four babies.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.291
Not five babies. Where's Tilly?

13:59.541 --> 14:03.625
What's wrong, Tilly?
Don't you want to eat your snack?

14:08.375 --> 14:10.458
Tilly wants to do another dance.

14:10.541 --> 14:14.875
-Well, let's do the silly dance.
-Yeah. Being silly is fun. Come on.

14:14.958 --> 14:15.958
Okay.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.333
<i>Bù!</i>

14:18.125 --> 14:21.750
"No"? You don't want
to do the silly dance?

14:22.333 --> 14:26.125
Kip, Tilly doesn't know
<i>how</i> to do the silly dance.

14:26.791 --> 14:31.083
Well, then we'll teach her.
Hey, Tilly, you stay here and watch us.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.875
Okay, come on. Yeah.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.833
<i>-Can you say silly?</i>
<i>-Silly!</i>

14:41.916 --> 14:43.625
<i>-Can you say dance?</i>
<i>-Dance!</i>

14:43.708 --> 14:45.333
<i>-Silly!</i>
<i>-Dance!</i>

14:45.416 --> 14:46.541
<i>Silly, silly dance!</i>

14:46.625 --> 14:50.041
<i>Let's do the silly</i>
<i>Really, really silly, really silly dance</i>

14:50.125 --> 14:53.250
<i>Stomp your feet, knock your knees</i>
<i>And shake your silly hands</i>

14:53.333 --> 14:56.375
<i>You don't need a silly shirt</i>
<i>To be a silly-pants</i>

14:56.458 --> 15:00.750
<i>Do the silly, really silly</i>
<i>Extra silly, really silly dance</i>

15:00.833 --> 15:01.875
<i>Jump like a frog</i>

15:01.958 --> 15:03.916
<i>-Ribbit</i>
<i>-Wag your tail like a dog</i>

15:04.000 --> 15:06.583
<i>-Woof, woof!</i>
<i>-I'm a bird, my wings are flapping</i>

15:06.666 --> 15:08.208
<i>-Cheep, cheep!</i>
<i>-Fly like a plane</i>

15:08.291 --> 15:09.166
<i>Vroom!</i>

15:09.250 --> 15:10.791
<i>And wiggle like a worm</i>

15:10.875 --> 15:14.083
<i>Get your head a-shaking</i>
<i>And your hands a-clapping</i>

15:15.666 --> 15:17.291
<i>Wear a silly hat</i>

15:17.375 --> 15:18.875
<i>Make fishy lips</i>

15:18.958 --> 15:20.583
<i>Wiggle your ears</i>

15:20.666 --> 15:22.291
<i>Just like this</i>

15:23.208 --> 15:26.833
<i>Let's do the silly</i>
<i>Really, really silly, really silly dance</i>

15:26.916 --> 15:30.083
<i>Stomp your feet, knock your knees</i>
<i>And shake your silly hands</i>

15:30.166 --> 15:33.250
<i>You don't need a silly shirt</i>
<i>To be a silly-pants</i>

15:33.333 --> 15:39.916
<i>Do the silly</i>
<i>Really silly, really silly dance</i>

15:42.458 --> 15:45.875
That was so much fun.
Did you like it, Tilly?

15:46.458 --> 15:47.625
Tilly?

15:48.375 --> 15:49.708
Where did she go?

15:50.708 --> 15:56.500
Oh no. Our silly dance was too silly,
and we sillied Tilly away.

15:57.125 --> 16:00.083
I think Tilly just walked away.

16:00.583 --> 16:05.083
Maybe she felt left out
because she couldn't dance with us.

16:05.166 --> 16:07.666
Oh no. We better find her.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.375
This sounds like a job for…

16:11.791 --> 16:14.083
Detective Kip!

16:15.583 --> 16:18.000
Let's see. Looking for clues.

16:20.583 --> 16:21.791
Hi.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.500
Look! On the table!

16:29.041 --> 16:30.416
There are only--

16:30.500 --> 16:34.666
one, two, three, four--

16:34.750 --> 16:36.500
four blueberry muffins here.

16:36.583 --> 16:43.250
And there were five blueberry muffins
for five babies.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.625
Is Tilly eating her snack?

16:47.750 --> 16:49.625
This is really messy.

16:50.416 --> 16:52.375
It's also a clue!

16:53.250 --> 16:55.708
Tilly left us a trail.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.000
Let's follow it.

17:02.708 --> 17:04.583
Look! Crumbs!

17:05.250 --> 17:06.916
-Yeah.
-Follow me.

17:07.916 --> 17:11.166
-She's got to be around here somewhere.
-Right.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.583
There she is!

17:16.666 --> 17:21.750
Tilly? Are you sad because you couldn't do
the silly dance with us?

17:24.750 --> 17:27.250
I'm sorry you felt left out, Tilly.

17:29.666 --> 17:35.166
Hey! You couldn't do my dance,
but, well, what if we learned your dance?

17:35.250 --> 17:39.083
You can teach us
your very own Tilly dance!

17:39.166 --> 17:40.416
Yeah!

17:40.500 --> 17:44.583
-Then we could dance together.
-Yeah!

17:47.833 --> 17:49.291
Tilly's fast.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.958
Hey! Wait for us!

17:52.458 --> 17:54.083
-Wait!
-Coming, Tilly!

17:56.375 --> 17:58.000
We're here.

17:58.916 --> 18:01.541
Okay, Tilly. Show us your dance.

18:04.916 --> 18:06.833
Dance!

18:12.333 --> 18:14.041
We're not hopping any more.

18:14.125 --> 18:19.250
-Doing robot moves now.
-Okay. Is that right, Tilly?

18:19.333 --> 18:20.333
Robot.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.541
Which one is this?

18:29.916 --> 18:34.583
We can't do your dance, Tilly.
You keep doing something different.

18:34.666 --> 18:37.375
Yeah. We don't know what comes next.

18:38.208 --> 18:42.000
Maybe your dance should have a pattern.

18:42.083 --> 18:46.541
Yeah. Yeah, if your dance repeats
like a pattern, we can follow you.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.666
Yeah.

18:55.625 --> 18:56.916
Tilly doesn't get it.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.833
Let's call Maths Molly.

19:01.916 --> 19:04.000
-She can help us.
-Yeah.

19:04.958 --> 19:07.625
Maths Molly!

19:10.000 --> 19:13.583
-Let's go!
-We're coming, Maths Molly!

19:15.083 --> 19:18.458
Come on, Tilly.
Maths Molly will help us learn your dance.

19:20.416 --> 19:23.541
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

19:23.625 --> 19:26.375
Yes. And we need a pattern.

19:29.916 --> 19:32.708
That's my dance, The Wallaby Hop!

19:32.791 --> 19:34.375
Is this a pattern?

19:41.625 --> 19:42.541
<i>Yes.</i>

19:43.041 --> 19:46.916
Yeah. Hop, hop, spin.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.833
Hop, hop, spin.

19:50.916 --> 19:52.458
Thank you.

19:52.541 --> 19:56.333
What about my dance? The Funky Noodle.

19:56.416 --> 20:00.000
Big kids, was my dance a pattern?

20:06.916 --> 20:07.916
<i>Yes.</i>

20:08.958 --> 20:13.125
Oh yeah. One slide, two wiggles.

20:13.208 --> 20:16.000
One slide, two wiggles.

20:16.833 --> 20:21.125
Yeah. Hey, Tilly,
can your dance have a pattern?

20:25.375 --> 20:26.208
<i>Yī.</i>

20:28.208 --> 20:29.541
"One" jump.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.000
One!

20:32.000 --> 20:33.041
<i>Èr.</i>

20:35.166 --> 20:36.666
"Two" claps.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.375
Two claps.

20:39.333 --> 20:40.291
<i>Sān.</i>

20:42.208 --> 20:43.958
"Three" stomps.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.833
One, two, three.

20:46.583 --> 20:49.416
And then we repeat those moves?

20:50.875 --> 20:52.708
Well, that's a great dance.

20:52.791 --> 20:55.500
-Should we all try it?
-Yeah!

20:58.416 --> 21:00.541
<i>Let's do Tilly's pattern dance</i>

21:00.625 --> 21:02.916
<i>-It's such a fun dance to do</i>
-Yeah!

21:03.000 --> 21:04.916
<i>We'll follow Tilly's pattern</i>

21:05.000 --> 21:07.083
<i>You can do it too</i>

21:07.166 --> 21:08.708
And it goes like this!

21:09.250 --> 21:11.416
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

21:11.500 --> 21:13.875
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

21:13.958 --> 21:15.916
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

21:16.000 --> 21:18.375
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

21:18.458 --> 21:20.750
<i>Can we change it a little?</i>
<i>Put a hop in the middle?</i>

21:20.833 --> 21:22.750
<i>Spin around and pretend to climb?</i>

21:22.833 --> 21:25.375
<i>But that's not Tilly's pattern</i>

21:25.458 --> 21:29.416
<i>A pattern does the same thing every time</i>

21:30.166 --> 21:31.666
Here we go!

21:31.750 --> 21:34.083
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

21:34.166 --> 21:36.541
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

21:36.625 --> 21:38.708
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

21:38.791 --> 21:41.541
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

21:41.625 --> 21:43.833
<i>That's Tilly's pattern</i>

21:46.625 --> 21:50.166
-Stomp one, two, three.
-Stomp, stomp, stomp!

21:50.916 --> 21:52.916
Tilly, your dance is fun.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Yeah, it's Tilly-rific!

21:56.666 --> 21:58.666
I really like the pattern.

22:00.708 --> 22:05.208
Maths Molly? Why are you here?
We already learned maths today.

22:05.291 --> 22:09.458
Lulu knows what Maths Molly wants.
A Maths Party!

22:09.541 --> 22:11.541
We forgot to have one!

22:11.625 --> 22:13.625
-Yeah!
-Oh yeah!

22:15.083 --> 22:16.500
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

22:16.583 --> 22:18.000
<i>We did math</i>s

22:18.083 --> 22:20.166
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

22:21.083 --> 22:24.000
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

22:24.083 --> 22:27.458
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

22:27.541 --> 22:28.375
Yeah!

22:28.458 --> 22:30.083
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

22:30.166 --> 22:31.500
<i>We did maths</i>

22:31.583 --> 22:33.833
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

22:34.500 --> 22:37.166
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

22:37.250 --> 22:42.000
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

22:42.083 --> 22:44.625
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

22:44.708 --> 22:47.541
<i>We love maths!</i>

22:49.250 --> 22:52.916
-Pretty, pretty balloons!
-Come here, balloon.

22:53.666 --> 22:56.750
Tilly just wants
to thank you for all your help.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.416
Bye, big kids!

22:58.500 --> 22:59.791
<i>Zàijiàn!</i>
