00:37.238 --> 00:38.339
ASH, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.141

OUT IN THE HALLWAY.

00:40.174 --> 00:43.077
- HEY, JILL, GREAT PARTY.
DO YOU HAVE A BLACK MARKER?

00:43.111 --> 00:45.113

A BLACK MARKER FOR?

[laughter]

00:47.615 --> 00:49.250

00:56.190 --> 00:58.226
- HEY!

00:58.259 --> 01:00.528
- I FOUND HER PASSED OUT.
SHE'S FAIR GAME.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.530
- GIVE ME THAT MARKER--
- NO. NO!

01:02.563 --> 01:04.598
NO ONE IS NEXT!
NO ONE IS NEXT!

01:04.632 --> 01:06.467
GET OUT!
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

01:06.500 --> 01:08.436
- SERIOUSLY,
GET THE HELL OUT, OKAY?

01:08.469 --> 01:09.737
- IS SHE SERIOUS?
- SHE'S SO LAME.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.572
- FUN HATER.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.107

01:13.907 --> 01:15.576

- OH...[laughs]

01:15.609 --> 01:16.744
CAITLIN.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.280
TIME TO WAKE UP
AND GO HOME.

[gasps]

01:24.318 --> 01:26.387
BLOOD!

01:28.389 --> 01:30.258
OH, MY GOD.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.861
DANNY...CALL 911.

01:33.894 --> 01:36.430
- THIS HOW YOU FOUND HER?
- YEAH, WITH HER SHIRT RIPPED.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.831
SHE'S SHORT
HALF A PINT OF BLOOD

01:37.865 --> 01:39.767
FROM THE SLASH
ON HER SCALP.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.537
- HER NAME'S CAITLIN LAMARCK.
26. FROM BROOKLYN.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.506
HERE'S WHERE
SHE STARTED BLEEDIN'.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.441
PERP RAMMED HER HEAD
INTO THIS MIRROR

01:47.475 --> 01:49.777
THEN THREW HER OVER
ONTO THOSE COATS AND GOT BUSY.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.612
- YEAH. WITH DOZENS OF PEOPLE
IN THE NEXT ROOM.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.814
UH, YOU...

01:53.847 --> 01:55.516
YOU THREW THE PARTY?
- YES. I'M JILL.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.418
- OKAY, JILL,
WE'RE GONNA NEED THE NAMES

01:57.451 --> 01:58.886
OF EVERYONE
WHO WAS HERE TONIGHT.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.421
- I CAN GIVE YOU
MY EVITE LIST,

02:00.454 --> 02:02.190
BUT CAITLIN WASN'T ON IT.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.226
- ANYONE HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH HER CRASHING YOUR PARTY?

02:05.259 --> 02:07.195
- PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.197
- OKAY, TELL THE E.R. DOCS
NOT TO WASH HER FACE.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.299
- READY TO ROLL, CLARK.
LET'S GO.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.866
- ALL RIGHT,
CLEAR A PATH, PEOPLE.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.302
- COME ON!

03:07.255 --> 03:08.656
- HEY, CAN I JUST
COME TO WORK WITH YOU?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.824
- CALVIN, YOU ALWAYS SAY
YOU'RE BORED AFTER TEN MINUTES.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.261
- IT'S BETTER THAN SCHOOL.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.495
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.364
ONE DAY YOU'RE GONNA LOOK BACK

03:16.397 --> 03:19.367
AND THINK THAT SCHOOL WAS
THE MOST FUN YOU EVER HAD.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.934
- OH, YOU REMEMBER BACK
THAT FAR?

03:20.968 --> 03:23.604
- [laughs]
OH! LISTEN TO YOU.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.605
VERY FUNNY.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.540
HERE YOU GO.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.245
- OLIVIA.
- YEAH.

03:31.279 --> 03:34.248
- DO YOU THINK
THAT MY MOM'S DEAD?

03:34.282 --> 03:35.749
- NO, CALVIN,
I DON'T THINK THAT.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.852
HONEY, SIT DOWN HERE.
COME HERE, SIT DOWN.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.523
I AM LOOKING FOR HER
EVERY DAY,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.525
AND YOUR DAD TOO.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.495
YOU DON'T EVER REMEMBER
YOUR MOM MENTIONING HIS NAME?

03:47.528 --> 03:50.531
- ONCE SHE SAID, "DAVID...

03:50.564 --> 03:52.032
GET OUT
OR I'M CALLING THE COPS."

03:52.065 --> 03:55.669
- YOUR MOM TOLD ME THAT HE LEFT
RIGHT AFTER YOU WERE BORN.

03:55.703 --> 03:59.340
- HE--HE STOPS BY, BUT...

03:59.373 --> 04:01.342
THEY ALWAYS END UP
IN A FIGHT.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.579
- WELL, ANYWAY, YOU...

04:05.613 --> 04:08.582
NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL
SO YOU CAN SHOW YOUR PARENTS

04:08.616 --> 04:11.419
HOW SMART YOU'VE GOTTEN
NEXT TIME YOU SEE 'EM.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.421
- NICE TRY.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.289
OH, WAIT.
I MADE THIS FOR YOU

04:15.323 --> 04:17.491
YESTERDAY IN ART CLASS.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.496
IT'S YOU.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.765
- CALVIN, IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

04:24.798 --> 04:26.567
- I EVEN SIGNED IT.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.869
- "CALVIN BENSON."

04:28.902 --> 04:32.540
- 'CAUSE YOU RESCUED ME.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.545
- GO TO SCHOOL.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.586
- SO HOW LONG
IS THIS GONNA GO ON?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.622
- WHAT, CALVIN PAINTING?
- YOU PLAYING MOM.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.725
- COME ON, EL.
THE KID'S BEEN THROUGH HELL.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.827
- OKAY.
- HE'S GOT A JUNKIE MOTHER,

04:53.861 --> 04:56.364
BEING ABANDONED--
I'M JUST TRYING TO GIVE HIM

04:56.397 --> 04:58.666
SOME STABILITY IN HIS LIFE.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.733
[ding]

04:59.767 --> 05:02.069
- NO LUCK FINDING HIS DAD?

05:02.102 --> 05:04.572
- FIRST NAME'S DAVID.
THERE'S NO LAST NAME.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.575
THERE'S NO FATHER
ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE, SO...

05:07.608 --> 05:09.009
I TOOK A BUCCAL SWATH
FROM CALVIN,

05:09.042 --> 05:11.345
SENT IT TO THE LAB
TO RUN FOR A FAMILIAL MATCH.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.713
I HAVEN'T HEARD BACK YET.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.649
- DOC, IS OUR VICTIM AWAKE YET?

05:15.683 --> 05:18.051
- I HOPE NOT.
SHE'S IN THE MORGUE.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.556
- CAITLIN LAMARCK DIED FROM
A MASSIVE SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.792
- PARAMEDIC SAID
IT WAS JUST A SCALP CUT.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.795
- WHEN HER HEAD HIT THE MIRROR,
IT CAUSED HER BRAIN TO BLEED.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.897
SHE SEIZED AND STOPPED
BREATHING IN THE E.R.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.500
DOCS COULDN'T RESUSCITATE HER.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.468
- THINK THE PERP MEANT
TO KILL HER ON PURPOSE?

05:34.502 --> 05:35.736
- FIND THE PRICK AND ASK HIM.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.371
TILL THEN,
I'M RULING IT A HOMICIDE.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.839
- WAS SHE RAPED?
- SLIGHT VAGINAL TEARING.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.608
[cell phone rings]
BUT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

05:40.641 --> 05:41.842
FROM ROUGH SEX.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.678
CAN'T TELL IF HE DID IT BEFORE
OR AFTER HE KNOCKED HER OUT.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.481
Benson: FIND FLUIDS?
- YEAH. BUT IT'S NOT SEMEN.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.750
- CONDOM LUBRICANT?

05:49.783 --> 05:51.685
- NEVER SEEN ONE THAT'S BLUE.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.121
ALSO SOME KIND OF
MICRO-PARTICULATE IN IT.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.624
I SENT A SAMPLE OFF TO THE LAB
FOR ANALYSIS.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.126
- OKAY. SO ALL WE HAVE
IS A DEAD GIRL WHO NOBODY LIKED.

05:59.159 --> 06:02.796
- YEAH. AND MUNCH AND FIN
JUST TRACKED DOWN WHY.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.565
- "MY LAY LIST:

06:04.598 --> 06:07.801
"A SCHOLARLY TREATISE
ON OFFICE RELATIONSHIPS

06:07.835 --> 06:10.037
BY CAITLIN LAMARCK."

06:10.070 --> 06:11.905
- IT'S A 32-PAGE
POWERPOINT DOCUMENT

06:11.939 --> 06:14.942
ON THE 15 DUDES SHE SLEPT WITH
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS.

06:14.975 --> 06:18.145
- WITH THEIR NAMES, PHOTOS...

06:18.178 --> 06:19.680
PROS AND CONS IN THE SACK?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.615
OH, AND A BAR GRAPH
OF PENIS SIZE.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.584
- YOU WERE EXPECTING
A PIE CHART?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.753
- PROBLEM IS,
CAITLIN DID THIS AS A GOOF

06:25.786 --> 06:27.154
ONLY FOR HER FRIENDS
TO SEE.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.889
- YEAH, LET ME GUESS.
TILL ONE OF THEM PUT IT ONLINE.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.658
- YEP. SHE WAS BOMBARDED
WITH HATE MAIL.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.160
MOST OF HER FRIENDS
ON FACEBOOK DROPPED HER.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.028
- AND THEN SHE WAS AXED
FROM HER AD AGENCY

06:35.062 --> 06:37.130
FOR GENERATING
NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.699
- REALLY? ANY OF THE GUYS
LOSE THEIR JOBS?

06:38.732 --> 06:41.134
- NOT THAT I CAN TELL.
- IT'S THE SAME OLD SONG.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.903
GUYS WHO SLEEP AROUND
ARE CONSIDERED STUDS,

06:42.936 --> 06:45.439
AND GIRLS WHO DO IT ARE
CONSIDERED SLUTS.

06:45.473 --> 06:48.075
- OKAY. SO OUR VICTIM
BLOGS ABOUT WHO SHE BANGED,

06:48.108 --> 06:49.610
BECOMES AN OUTCAST.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.578
NOW, HOW'D SHE END UP
AT THE PARTY

06:50.611 --> 06:52.012
WITH ALL HER FORMER FRIENDS?

06:52.045 --> 06:55.549
- WELL, HERE'S THE EVITE LIST
THAT JILL SENT US.

06:55.583 --> 06:59.086
I CROSSED IT WITH CAITLIN'S
CATALOGUE OF CONQUESTS.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.791
- SO LET'S GO ASK THE GUYS
ON HER LAY LIST

07:03.824 --> 07:05.759
WHO WERE THERE LAST NIGHT.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.098
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO INVITED CAITLIN.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.100
- DIDN'T STOP YOU FROM
HUMILIATING HER WITH A MARKER

07:13.133 --> 07:14.668
AFTER SHE ARRIVED.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.604
- PARTY 101--YOU PASS OUT,
YOU GET CHIEFED.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.838
HAPPENED TO ME
PLENTY OF TIMES.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.640
- EXCEPT THAT CAITLIN
DIDN'T PASS OUT.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.842
SHE WAS WHACKED SO HARD
OVER THE HEAD,

07:21.875 --> 07:23.677
IT KILLED HER.

07:23.711 --> 07:24.444
- NOW, YOU SURE
YOU DIDN'T TAP THAT

07:24.478 --> 07:26.213
BEFORE YOU CALLED IN
YOUR PALS?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.548
WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME, RIGHT?

07:27.581 --> 07:28.916
- LOOK, A LOT OF PEOPLE
WERE UPSET

07:28.949 --> 07:31.018
ABOUT CAITLIN MAKING THAT LIST--
NOT ME.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.120
- YOU SURE? 'CAUSE UNDER CONS

07:33.153 --> 07:36.223
IT SAID THAT YOU FELL ASLEEP
IN RECORD TIME AFTERWARDS.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.691
- AND SHE ALSO VOTED ME
BIGGEST PENIS.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.159
YOU KNOW HOW MANY CHICKS
FRIENDED ME

07:39.192 --> 07:40.360
BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE WROTE?

07:40.393 --> 07:42.696
- I LOST A LOT OF FRIENDS
'CAUSE OF CAITLIN'S STUPID LIST.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.698
- AH, I WONDER WHY...
"MY NEXT LAY, RYAN,

07:44.732 --> 07:47.267
"IS THE HOTTEST
PHOTOGRAPHER AT THE FIRM.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.569
"SO I LURED HIM
INTO THE DARKROOM

07:48.602 --> 07:49.937
"TO SEE WHAT WOULD DEVELOP.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.705
TOO BAD HE SHOOTS
WITH A VERY SHORT LENS."

07:51.739 --> 07:53.140
- OUCH.
- THAT BITCH IS A LIAR.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.642
- SO YOU INVITED THAT BITCH
TO THE PARTY

07:54.675 --> 07:56.577
TO TEACH HER
NOT TO OPEN HER BIG MOUTH

07:56.610 --> 07:58.812
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE WIENIE.
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.047
I DIDN'T MEAN BITCH, OKAY?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.915
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW CAITLIN
WAS AT THE PARTY

08:01.949 --> 08:04.017
UNTIL DANNY TOLD ME.
I WAS TOO BUSY TAKING PHOTOS.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.253
HERE--THEY'RE ON HERE.
YOU CAN CHECK THE TIME STAMPS.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.955
- DON'T MIND IF WE DO.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.690
- DO YOU MIND?
I'M ON MY LUNCH BREAK.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.158
- WELL, WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

08:11.191 --> 08:13.060
WHO MURDERED CAITLIN LAMARCK.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.562
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.629
Benson: WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
START BY TELLING US

08:15.663 --> 08:18.599
WHO INVITED HER TO THE PARTY.
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.968
HER FRIENDS STOPPED
TALKING TO HER MONTHS AGO.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.603
- AFTER SHE PUBLISHED
HER LAY LIST.

08:22.636 --> 08:23.971
- THE ONE THAT YOU
APPEAR ON...

08:24.004 --> 08:26.940
UNDER THE TITLE
"A HOT PIECE OF ASH."

08:26.974 --> 08:30.277
- CAITLIN AND I PARTNERED
ON AN AUDI CAMPAIGN LAST YEAR.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.080
WE WERE TOTALLY WIPED AFTER
WORKING THREE NIGHTS IN A ROW.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.315
I HAD A BOTTLE
OF TEQUILA IN MY DESK.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.416
BEFORE THAT MOMENT,

08:36.449 --> 08:38.719
I NEVER THOUGHT OF HER
AS ANYTHING BUT A COWORKER.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.621
- THAT'S NOT HOW
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.156
"I'VE BEEN CRUSHING
ON ASH ALL YEAR.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.559
"JUST MY LUCK
THAT HE'S THE ONLY GUY HERE

08:45.593 --> 08:47.160
WHO HAS A STEADY GIRLFRIEND."

08:47.194 --> 08:49.162
- IF SHE HADN'T BLABBED
ABOUT YOUR FLING,

08:49.196 --> 08:50.831
COULD HAVE STAYED YOUR SECRET.
- I TOLD YOU,

08:50.864 --> 08:52.165
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO CAITLIN.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.002
- WE?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.971
- ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.673
- WHY WOULD I INVITE CAITLIN?

08:59.707 --> 09:01.742
SLUT ALMOST RUINED
MY RELATIONSHIP.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.011
- BY BANGING YOUR BOYFRIEND
AND THEN BRAGGING ABOUT IT.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.980
- EXACTLY.
EVERYONE HATED HER AFTER THAT.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.849
I WAS HAPPY SHE FELL OFF
THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.250
- WELL, THAT'S WEIRD,

09:10.283 --> 09:11.819
'CAUSE YOU WORD IT
A LITTLE DIFFERENT

09:11.852 --> 09:13.687
IN THE TEXT
YOU SENT TO HER PHONE.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.989
"CAITLIN, SORRY I FORGOT
TO PUT YOU ON THE LIST.

09:16.023 --> 09:20.227
FORGET THE HATERS.
COME TO THE PARTY."

09:20.260 --> 09:21.695
- COME ON, NOW.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.631
IS THAT A LIP QUIVER
COMING FROM THE GIRL

09:23.664 --> 09:25.365
WHO SET THE TRAP FOR THE SLUT?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.000
HMM?

09:27.034 --> 09:28.736
AND THEN YOU ACT ALL HORRIFIED

09:28.769 --> 09:31.639
WHEN YOU FIND YOUR FRIENDS
DRAWING ON HER FACE?

09:31.672 --> 09:34.708
- YOU'RE THE HATER, JILL.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.243
THAT'S WHY YOU KILLED CAITLIN.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.711
- NO, I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR HER TO DIE!

09:37.745 --> 09:40.147
OKAY? I JUST WANTED
TO HUMILIATE HER

09:40.180 --> 09:41.749
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.353
- WELL, YOU DID
A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.760
- SHE WENT TO THROW
HER COAT IN THE BEDROOM,

09:52.793 --> 09:55.095
AND I FOLLOWED HER.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.666
WE ARGUED,

09:58.699 --> 10:02.069
AND I GRABBED HER...

10:02.102 --> 10:04.705
AND HER SHIRT RIPPED.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.809
THEN I SHOVED HER,

10:08.842 --> 10:10.878
AND HER HEAD BROKE THE MIRROR.

10:10.911 --> 10:14.181
AND WHEN I SAW BLOOD,
I PANICKED.

10:14.214 --> 10:18.318
I THREW HER ON THE BED SO PEOPLE
WOULD THINK SHE WAS DRUNK.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.853
- AND THEN YOU SODOMIZED HER

10:19.887 --> 10:22.155
'CAUSE SHE SCREWED
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

10:22.189 --> 10:24.091
- NO! GOD, I ONLY SHOVED HER.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.694
THEN I WENT BACK TO MY FRIENDS.

10:26.727 --> 10:27.895
- SO YOU ALL WERE JUST
BOOZING IT UP

10:27.928 --> 10:29.697
WHILE CAITLIN
WAS LYING THERE FOR AN HOUR

10:29.730 --> 10:31.732
BLEEDING INTO HER BRAIN.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.401
THAT'S SOME PARTY.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.704
- PLEASE...

10:36.737 --> 10:40.173
I NEVER WANTED HER TO DIE.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.009
- YOU BELIEVE HER?

10:42.042 --> 10:43.811
- I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT YEAH.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.312
NOW THAT WE KNOW
HOW SHE DIED,

10:45.345 --> 10:46.413
WE STILL LOOKING FOR
A RAPIST?

10:46.446 --> 10:49.649
- IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY GUY
WHO WAS AT THAT PARTY.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.221
- IT WASN'T.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.957
THE BLUE SUBSTANCE
IN THE MICRO-PARTICULATE

10:56.990 --> 10:58.726
I FOUND INSIDE YOUR VICTIM--

10:58.759 --> 11:01.294
LAB FIGURED OUT
WHAT IT WAS.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.764
- DEFIBRILLATOR
TRANSMISSION GEL

11:03.797 --> 11:07.935
AND SILICA POWDER
FROM A LATEX MEDICAL GLOVE.

11:07.968 --> 11:11.404
- ONE OF THE PARAMEDICS
RAPED CAITLIN.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.179
- MIKE O'DOOLE. 56.
OUT OF BROOKLYN.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.480
MARRIED WITH THREE CHILDREN.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.382
BEEN ON THE JOB 32 YEARS.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.151
TWO PRESCOTT MEDALS

11:24.184 --> 11:26.720
AND NUMEROUS PRE-HOSPITAL
SAVE CITATIONS.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.221
- OKAY. SO IN OTHER WORDS,
HE'S SQUEAKY CLEAN.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.758
- HIS PARTNER, NOT SO MUCH.
CLARK TINTA. 31.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.394
IN '07, 911 RECEIVED A CALL

11:34.427 --> 11:36.196
FROM HIS PLACE
IN PELHAM PARKWAY.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.397
HIS GIRLFRIEND TOLD DISPATCH

11:37.430 --> 11:39.199
THAT HE HAD FORCED HER
TO HAVE SEX.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.935
NOW, BY THE TIME PATROL
GOT THERE, SHE CHANGED HER TUNE

11:41.969 --> 11:43.771
AND SAID THEY WERE
JUST ROLE-PLAYING.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.106
- THEN LAST YEAR HE'S ACCUSED
OF INAPPROPRIATE CONTACT

11:46.139 --> 11:47.474
WITH A HIT-AND-RUN VICTIM.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.442
SHE CAME TO
IN BACK OF THE BUS,

11:49.476 --> 11:51.144
AND HE HAD HIS HANDS
IN HER CROTCH.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.046
HE BLAMED IT
ON A BUMPY RIDE.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.283
- SO THIS GUY GETS OFF FORCING
HIMSELF ON INJURED WOMEN.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.318
- WE NEED TO PUT TINTA
IN THE BACK OF THAT AMBULANCE

11:58.351 --> 12:01.321
WITH CAITLIN.
- UNTIL WE MAKE THE CASE,

12:01.354 --> 12:03.290
THESE GUYS
ARE OUR FDNY BRETHREN.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.292
JUST...TREAD LIGHTLY.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.763
- HEY, GUYS.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.065
HEY. GOT A MINUTE?

12:12.099 --> 12:14.201
- DETECTIVE, UH, STABLER,
RIGHT?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.336
FROM THE PARTY CALL IN SOHO.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.838
- YOU GOT IT.
THIS IS BENSON.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.406
- OH, YOU TRADED UP.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.041
- OH, FIN'LL BE CRUSHED
TO HEAR THAT.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.175
- SO WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?

12:22.209 --> 12:24.511
- IT'S ABOUT THE GIRL
THAT YOU TRANSPORTED THAT NIGHT,

12:24.544 --> 12:27.114
THE ONE WHO PASSED OUT
ON ALL THOSE COATS.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.082
- OH. HEARD ABOUT HER.
SHE MORTED IN THE E.R.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.084
SHAME.
- YEAH, YEAH, SHE WAS A CUTIE.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.886
- YEAH, ACTUALLY,
THE CUTIE HAD A NAME.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.321
IT WAS CAITLIN.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.057
NOW, OUR M.E. SAYS
THAT SHE WAS RAPED.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.993
- SO WHAT. YOU'RE, UH...
TALKING TO US BECAUSE--

12:40.027 --> 12:42.195
- WELL, WE WERE WONDERING IF
SHE CAME TO ON BOARD YOUR BUS.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.997
MAYBE SHE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT THE PARTY?

12:44.031 --> 12:45.565
MAYBE MENTIONED
A GUY'S NAME?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.034
- WHAT DO YOU SAY, MIKE?

12:47.067 --> 12:50.003
YOU WERE IN THE BACK
ON THAT RUN, RIGHT?

12:50.037 --> 12:51.438
- GIRL NEVER SPOKE.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.173
- MAYBE YOU JOTTED DOWN
SOMETHING YOU FORGOT ABOUT.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.142
DO YOU MIND IF WE TAKE
A LOOK AT YOUR RUN SHEET?

12:55.175 --> 12:57.044
- YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY,
WE'RE BACKED UP ON PAPERWORK.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.345
IT'S HARD TO GET FIVE SECONDS
[horn blares]

12:58.378 --> 13:00.080
AROUND HERE WITHOUT
THAT HORN GOING OFF AGAIN.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.048
- LIKE THAT.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.416
- YEAH.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.086
[horn continues blaring]

13:08.255 --> 13:10.858
[siren wailing]

13:10.891 --> 13:12.893
- NOW, AM I CRAZY,
OR DID OUR BRETHREN

13:12.926 --> 13:14.227
JUST LIE STRAIGHT TO OUR FACES?

13:14.261 --> 13:15.162
- WHAT THE HELL KIND OF MAN

13:15.195 --> 13:18.231
COVERS FOR A PARTNER
WHO'S RAPING GIRLS?

13:18.265 --> 13:20.133
- THE KIND WITH HIS OWN
SKELETONS IN THE CLOSET.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.135
THESE ARE CALLS O'DOOLE
AND TINTA RESPONDED TO

13:22.169 --> 13:23.570
IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.106
THESE ARE THEFTS REPORTED
AT THE SAME ADDRESSES

13:26.139 --> 13:27.207
SHORTLY THEREAFTER--

13:27.240 --> 13:30.043
WATCHES, JEWELRY,
CASH LEFT OUT.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.245
- PARTNERS IN CRIME.
TINTA RAPES, O'DOOLE ROBS.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.181
- YEAH. AND ONE COVERS
FOR THE OTHER.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.583
- THAT'S PRETTY BALLSY,
STEALING IN PLAIN SIGHT.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.919
- CAPTAIN, YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY
THESE CRIME SCENES ARE--

13:38.952 --> 13:41.088
COPS TRAMPLING THROUGH,
NOSY NEIGHBORS,

13:41.121 --> 13:43.056
KIDS CRYIN' AND SCREAMIN'.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.892
- I SEE VALUABLES LYING OUT
ALL THE TIME.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.160
IF I HAD STICKY FINGERS,
I'D BE TEMPTED.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.096
- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE
WEARING RUBBER GLOVES.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.297
- HOW COME NOBODY'S
EVER PUT IT TOGETHER?

13:50.330 --> 13:53.233
- FDNY IS RUNNING AN INTERNAL
INVESTIGATION ON O'DOOLE.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.635
WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT HIS
PARTNER MAY BE RAPING PATIENTS,

13:55.668 --> 13:58.171
THEY GAVE ME EVERYTHING THEY HAD
AND THEY SAID, "GO WITH GOD."

13:58.205 --> 13:59.339
- O'DOOLE IS THE WEAK LINK.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.108
WE HIT HIM,
HE'LL FLIP ON TINTA.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.209
- HIT HIM HARD.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.212
JOHN, FIN, TAKE CSU AND SEE
WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT

14:05.245 --> 14:08.848
FROM THE LAST PEOPLE
WHO REPORTED A THEFT.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.452
- I HAD A HEART ATTACK.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.154
- LARRY...YOU HAD
A PANIC ATTACK.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.923
WE'RE BEING FORCED TO SELL,

14:15.956 --> 14:18.491
AND YESTERDAY
WAS OUR FIRST OPEN HOUSE.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.128
- FORCED TO SELL?

14:21.161 --> 14:22.662
- MY HUSBAND
MADE SOME BAD INVESTMENTS.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.532
- BERNIE MADOFF.
HE CAN KISS MY WRINKLED ASS.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.969
- THE PARAMEDICS CAME,
TOOK LARRY TO THE HOSPITAL...

14:29.002 --> 14:31.071
WHERE THE DOCTORS
GAVE HIM A SEDATIVE.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.940
THANK GOD.
- WHEN DID YOU FIRST NOTICE

14:32.973 --> 14:34.174
THAT YOUR WEDDING RING
WAS MISSING?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.176
- AROUND MIDNIGHT.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.245
OH, WE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE
IN HERE YESTERDAY--

14:38.278 --> 14:40.513
MAKES ME SICK TO THINK
ONE OF THEM TOOK IT.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.215
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HERE TO FIND OUT.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.617
- YOU KNOW, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THE NYPD RESPONDS LIKE THIS

14:44.651 --> 14:46.519
FOR ONE STOLEN RING.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.923
- MA'AM, WE TAKE CRIME
VERY SERIOUSLY.

14:49.957 --> 14:53.093
- YOU THINK I SWIPED
SOME OLD LADY'S RING?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.394
- NO. WE KNOW YOU DID IT,
O'DOOLE.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.329
- WHAT ABOUT THE 30 OTHER
PEOPLE IN THE APARTMENT?

14:56.363 --> 14:58.198
NONE OF THEM ARE SUSPECTS?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.632
- THEY WERE THERE
FOR AN OPEN HOUSE.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.169
YOU WERE THERE
TO FILL YOUR POCKETS.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.603
- [laughing]
THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.505
I MEAN, WHAT, DID TINTA
PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

15:05.538 --> 15:07.407
- TINTA. WE'LL GET TO HIM
IN A MINUTE,

15:07.440 --> 15:09.242
BUT FIRST YOU NEED TO TELL US

15:09.276 --> 15:10.677
WHY YOU WENT ALL THE WAY
TO THE BACK

15:10.710 --> 15:12.112
OF THE DONOHOS' APARTMENT

15:12.145 --> 15:14.014
WHEN LARRY COLLAPSED
IN THE FRONT ROOM.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.249
- I NEVER WENT IN THE BACK.
- THEN WHY DID CSU

15:16.283 --> 15:18.485
FIND YOUR PUBIC HAIR
STUCK TO THE TOILET

15:18.518 --> 15:20.553
IN THE MASTER BATHROOM...

15:20.587 --> 15:23.323
15 FEET FROM WHERE
ARLEEN'S RING DISAPPEARED?

15:23.356 --> 15:26.326
- AND DON'T TELL US
IT WAS THE BREEZE.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.999
- OHH...NOW I REMEMBER.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.201
SEE, I HIT THE HEAD.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.236
LADY OF THE HOUSE
GAVE ME PERMISSION.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.138
- NO. ACTUALLY, SHE POINTED
YOU TO THE BATHROOM

15:38.171 --> 15:39.372
RIGHT OFF THE KITCHEN.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.741
- WELL, I GUESS I USED
THE WRONG JOHN.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.842
- SO THAT'S YOUR M.O., HUH?

15:42.875 --> 15:46.279
YOU ASK TO USE THE JOHN,
AND YOU GO TO THE WRONG ONE,

15:46.313 --> 15:48.115
KEEPING YOUR EYES OPEN
FOR BOOTY ALONG THE WAY?

15:48.148 --> 15:50.183
- ANYBODY LOOKS AT YOU FUNNY,

15:50.217 --> 15:52.085
TINTA'S RIGHT THERE
TO BACK YOUR PLAY, HUH?

15:52.119 --> 15:53.386
- MM-HMM. LIKE YOU BACKED HIS

15:53.420 --> 15:56.189
WHEN WE CAME
ASKING ABOUT CAITLIN LAMARCK.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.960
WE KNOW HE WAS IN THE BACK
WITH HER--NOT YOU.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.264
- LOOK...COME ON.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.399
WE'RE ALL BROTHERS HERE.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.268
- NO, DON'T EVEN.
DON'T EVEN.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.605
- ALL RIGHT.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.174
ALL RIGHT, UH...

16:14.207 --> 16:16.376
MAYBE I TOOK A FEW THINGS
I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.745
LOOK, I GOT TWO KIDS
WHO LOST THEIR JOBS.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.713
THEY MOVED BACK HOME.
I GOTTA PAY MY BILLS.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.115
- BY TURNING A BLIND EYE
TO A PARTNER

16:22.149 --> 16:24.451
WHO'S RAPING WOMEN?
- NO! NO, NO, NO.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.286
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TINTA'S
DOING BACK THERE.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.221
I JUST KNOW SOMETIMES
HE BLOCKS THE WINDOW,

16:28.255 --> 16:29.589
BUT I--
- YOU DON'T KNOW!

16:29.622 --> 16:31.258
- NO!
- YOU DON'T KNOW--

16:31.291 --> 16:33.093
THAT MAKES YOU THE BIGGEST
IDIOT IN THE WORLD.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.628
IF YOU DO KNOW,
IT MAKES YOU AN ACCOMPLICE.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.134
SO WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.402
HMM?

16:42.435 --> 16:44.404
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:44.437 --> 16:47.040
I'M AN IDIOT, OKAY?

16:47.074 --> 16:50.377
I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.
I SHOULD HAVE--AH, GOD.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.812
I--[laughs]
COME ON, THERE'S GOTTA

16:52.845 --> 16:55.182
BE SOME WAY
TO MAKE THIS RIGHT, NO?

16:55.215 --> 16:58.051
- YEAH, THERE IS.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.553
HELP US NAIL
THE SON OF A BITCH.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.125
- OKAY, SO WE GOTTA GET
O'DOOLE BACK

17:05.158 --> 17:06.726
BEFORE THEIR SHIFT STARTS
IN AN HOUR.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.129
- BEFORE TINTA GETS ANOTHER
GIRL IN THE BACK OF THAT BUS.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.131
[cell phone rings]
OLIVIA BENSON.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.800
- YOU BREAK O'DOOLE?
- DID YOU DOUBT WE WOULD?

17:13.833 --> 17:14.901
- GUY'S DIRTY.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.737
IT WOULD HELP IF WE HAD SOME
HARD EVIDENCE ON TINTA.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.506
- YEAH, WE'RE WORKING
ON THAT PLAN RIGHT NOW.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.807
- ARE YOU GONNA HATE ME
IF I FLAKE?

17:20.840 --> 17:23.343
CALVIN GOT IN A FIGHT
AT SCHOOL.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.413
- GO. WE'LL GET IT DONE.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.781
HEY, FIN, YOU WANT IN
ON BRINGING DOWN

17:28.815 --> 17:30.717
THAT DIRT BAG TINTA?
- THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.819
LET ME GO PUT THIS
IN EVIDENCE FIRST.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.671
- SHE NEVER SENT IT IN.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.212
- YOU'RE AWFUL QUIET.
YOU STILL WITH ME?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.847
- YEAH.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.516
JUST HOPE WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING
THESE TWO FOR DAYS

18:03.550 --> 18:05.285
BEFORE WE GET WHAT WE NEED.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.286
- YOU KNOW, UH,

18:06.319 --> 18:09.122
CLARK...

18:09.156 --> 18:10.323
I GOTTA SAY--

18:10.357 --> 18:14.127
YOU REALLY OWE ME FOR LYING

18:16.663 --> 18:18.298
- WHAT, LIKE I NEVER
LIED FOR YOU?

18:18.331 --> 18:20.533
- OH, NO, NO, NO, I--

18:20.567 --> 18:23.303
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT IT WAS...

18:23.336 --> 18:26.139
PFFT...HA.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.308
- YEAH.
NAW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.709
I DO OWE YOU.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.744
YOU KNOW, THAT CAITLIN CHICK,
SHE WAS REAL SWEET.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.446
- REALLY, HUH?
- YEAH.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.482
- HA HA.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.584
BUT, UH--[ahem]
BETTER THAN THE OTHERS?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.552
- OH, NO.
NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.454
CUTIE IN THE CAR WRECK
LAST WEEK...

18:41.488 --> 18:43.156
SHE WAS A NICE PIECE.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.791
- OH...YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- OH, OH!

18:44.824 --> 18:46.659
- WHAT?
- THAT BLONDE...

18:46.693 --> 18:48.295
THAT ODed, REMEMBER?
- OHH...YEAH.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.562
- YEAH, YEAH.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.198
THAT BITCH EVEN PUT UP
A BIT OF A FIGHT.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.866
- NO. REALLY?
- YEAH. SHE WAS NICE.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.902
YOU KNOW WHAT, MIKE?
THAT'S WHY...

18:55.935 --> 18:58.371
THAT'S WHY YOU AND I
MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.839
RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.342
- WE LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.
[clink]

19:09.382 --> 19:11.918
WHY ARE THESE CLOWNS BACK?
- I DON'T KNOW. WHO?

19:21.361 --> 19:22.795
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

19:22.829 --> 19:25.232
- OKAY, TINTA.
LET'S MAKE THIS EASY.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.868
- EVERYBODY STAY DOWN!

19:33.406 --> 19:35.308
- TINTA, FREEZE!

19:37.977 --> 19:38.978
- OPEN UP!

19:39.011 --> 19:41.314
- TINTA, OPEN THE DOOR.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.749
TINTA...TINT--

19:46.018 --> 19:47.387
OH, MY GOD.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.955
TINTA, DON'T.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.323
TINTA, DON'T!

19:52.392 --> 19:53.726
TINTA, DON'T!

19:53.760 --> 19:56.596
- AAH!

20:05.705 --> 20:07.374
[knock at door]

20:08.775 --> 20:11.010
- OH. EL.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.646
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.
- GOT NEWS.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.282
- YEAH. FIN ALREADY CALLED.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.450
TINTA GAVE HIMSELF
AN AIR EMBOLISM?

20:17.484 --> 20:19.452
THAT'S CRAZY.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.987
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY I'M HERE.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.855
CSU FINISHED RUNNING
THE FINGERPRINTS

20:22.889 --> 20:23.923
FROM THE DONOHO PLACE.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.326
- THE COUPLE
WHO HAD THE OPEN HOUSE.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.296
- YEAH. NONE OF THEM POPPED
EXCEPT FOR A THUMBPRINT

20:29.329 --> 20:31.698
OFF THE MEDICINE CABINET.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.970
- VIVIAN WAS THERE?

20:38.004 --> 20:41.374
- LOOKS LIKE CALVIN'S MOM
WAS CLOSER THAN WE THOUGHT.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.419
- I THOUGHT WHEN VIVIAN
DISAPPEARED

20:52.452 --> 20:53.586
THAT SHE SKIPPED TOWN
FOR GOOD.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.654
- SHE WAS WITH HER FRIEND
SARAH.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.756
CSU FOUND HER PRINTS
IN THE DONOHOS' LIVING ROOM.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.024
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING
AT AN OPEN HOUSE?

20:58.057 --> 20:59.526
IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE LOOKING TO BUY.

20:59.559 --> 21:00.693
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

21:00.727 --> 21:01.928
JUNKIES HIT OPEN HOUSES
ALL THE TIME

21:01.961 --> 21:03.563
LOOKING FOR
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.998
LET'S GO TALK
TO THE DONOHOS.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.368
- WELL, THAT'LL SEND US
ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE.

21:08.401 --> 21:11.037
- OR IT'LL GIVE US A CHANCE
TO MAYBE FIND VIVIAN.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.872
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE DRAGGING YOUR FEET?

21:12.905 --> 21:14.841
- EXCUSE ME?

21:14.874 --> 21:16.609
- LOOK, YOU'VE HAD
FOUR CUPS OF COFFEE,

21:16.643 --> 21:18.044
YOU CLEANED OUT YOUR IN-BOX--

21:18.077 --> 21:20.313
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT'S HAPPENED IN A MONTH--

21:20.347 --> 21:21.681
ALL BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANNA GO OUT THERE

21:21.714 --> 21:23.783
AND TRY AND FIND THE WOMAN
THAT MURDERED BURLOCK.

21:23.816 --> 21:26.319
- OKAY, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT SHE MURDERED BURLOCK,

21:26.353 --> 21:28.087
AND IF SHE DID,
WE SHOULD GIVE HER A MEDAL.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.689
- I AGREE WITH YOU,
SO LET'S FIND HER

21:29.722 --> 21:30.690
AND PIN IT ON HER CHEST.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.425
LOOK, WE CAN'T STALL ON THIS

21:32.459 --> 21:35.362
THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN STALLING
ABOUT FINDING CALVIN'S DAD.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.396
- WHAT?

21:36.429 --> 21:37.930
- [clears throat]

21:37.964 --> 21:39.632
I FOUND THE SWAB YESTERDAY.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.901
I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T SEND IN
CALVIN'S DNA TO THE LAB.

21:41.934 --> 21:43.670
- YOU'RE SNOOPING
THROUGH MY DESK?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.440
- YOU LEFT YOUR DRAWER OPEN.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.908
I WENT TO CLOSE IT.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.677
THERE IT WAS.
THAT'S IT.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.779
- I THOUGHT
THAT I SENT IN THE SWAB,

21:52.812 --> 21:56.015
SO IF I DIDN'T,
I FORGOT AND I MADE A MISTAKE.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.917
I'LL SEND IT IN NOW.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.353
- I ALREADY DID.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.021
- GOOD.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.624
ELLIOT, DO ME A FAVOR.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.626
LET ME TAKE POINT ON THIS.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.596
IF VIVIAN IS RIPPING OFF
PEOPLE'S MEDICINE CABINETS,

22:09.629 --> 22:10.930
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE HER HEAD IS.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.065
I JUST DON'T WANT HER
TO DO ANYTHING STUPID.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.001
- YOU GOT IT.
I'LL FOLLOW, YOU LEAD.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.069
COME ON.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.772
- OLIVIA.

22:19.806 --> 22:20.740
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.709
- I'M NOT?

22:22.742 --> 22:24.811
- YOU HAVE CUSTODY
OF OUR SUSPECT'S SON.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.979
- AND YOU THINK
THAT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.180
- HER ATTORNEY WILL.

22:28.214 --> 22:30.750
A SMART ONE MIGHT EVEN SAY
YOU RIGGED THE GAME ALL ALONG,

22:30.783 --> 22:33.520
EXERTED UNDUE INFLUENCE SO YOU
COULD GET YOUR HANDS ON CALVIN.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.855
- VIVIAN SIGNED HIM
OVER TO HER.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.990
- A CONFUSED MOVE BY AN ADDICT

22:38.024 --> 22:39.826
BEING MANIPULATED
BY A DETECTIVE

22:39.859 --> 22:41.628
DESPERATE TO START
HER OWN FAMILY.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.829
- IS THAT HOW YOU SEE ME?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.731
- ONLY MATTERS
HOW A JURY SEES YOU.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.699
- I DIDN'T ASK ABOUT A JURY.
- AND I'M NOT ASKING YOU

22:46.733 --> 22:49.536
TO STAND DOWN.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.704
[cell phone vibrates]

22:53.540 --> 22:54.974
- OLIVIA BENSON.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.643
WHAT?

22:56.676 --> 22:58.645
WELL--[sighs]

22:58.678 --> 23:00.513
YES. YES.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.981
I'M ON MY WAY.

23:02.014 --> 23:05.718
CALVIN JUST GOT
IN ANOTHER FIGHT,

23:05.752 --> 23:06.919
SO, UH, YOU WIN.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.556
I'M OUTTA HERE.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.828
- IS YOUR PARTNER OKAY?
- YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.164
SHE'LL BE BETTER ONCE
VIVIAN ARLISS IS IN CUSTODY,

23:18.197 --> 23:20.166
SO WE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I TRACK HER DOWN.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.768
- YOU'RE OFF THE CASE TOO.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.837
- WHO IS GOING TO ACCUSE ME
OF STEALING ANYONE'S KID?

23:24.871 --> 23:26.539
I ALREADY GOT FIVE OF MY OWN.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.207
- YOU'VE ALSO HAD
DETECTIVE BENSON'S BACK

23:28.240 --> 23:29.542
FOR OVER A DECADE.

23:29.576 --> 23:30.777
JURIES SEE HOW CLOSE
PARTNERS GET.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.079
SOME ARE TIGHTER
THAN MARRIED COUPLES.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.714
- ELLIOT, LET'S NOT SCREW
OUR CHANCE

23:34.747 --> 23:37.784
TO GET VIVIAN
FOR BURLOCK'S MURDER.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.053
FIN. I NEED YOU.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.689
- YES, SHE WAS HERE,

23:42.722 --> 23:45.792
BUT SHE CALLED HERSELF CLAIRE,
NOT VIVIAN.

23:45.825 --> 23:49.195
HA. MY WIFE THOUGHT
SHE WAS A LITTLE SEEDY,

23:49.228 --> 23:51.197
AND WHAT WITH THE TATTOOS,
BUT...

23:51.230 --> 23:53.766
- CLAIRE HAVE A FRIEND WITH HER?
- NICE GIRL TOO.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.468
THOUGH SHE DID
TALK MY EAR OFF.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.804
- RUNNIN' INTERFERENCE
WHILE VIV SACKED THE JOINT.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.572
- MR. DONOHO,
DID YOU HAVE A SIGN-IN BOOK

23:59.606 --> 24:00.773
FOR YOUR OPEN HOUSE?

24:00.807 --> 24:03.576
WE'D LIKE TO FIND OUT EXACTLY
WHEN THESE TWO DROPPED BY.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.978
- YEAH. THEY CAME BY AT, UH...

24:08.147 --> 24:09.749
AH. 2:35.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.785
DIDN'T THE LADY COP
TELL YOU ALL THIS?

24:12.819 --> 24:15.187
- LADY COP?
- CAME BY 20 MINUTES AGO.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.624
NAME WAS, UH...BENSON?

24:17.657 --> 24:19.959
SHE ASKED MY WIFE
ALL THESE SAME QUESTIONS.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.260
- LIV FAKED GETTING THAT CALL.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.695
SHE WASN'T GOING TO
CALVIN'S SCHOOL.

24:22.729 --> 24:25.131
- SHE WANTED A HEAD START
FINDING VIVIAN.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.501
[pinging]
- COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

24:28.535 --> 24:31.504
TWO WOMEN CAME OUT OF
262 CENTRAL PARK WEST.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.105
BUILDING SECURITY CAMERA
CAUGHT 'EM

24:33.139 --> 24:34.173
GETTING INTO YOUR CAB.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.275
- YEAH. HOT GIRLS.
GOOD TIPPERS.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.144
- YEAH? CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE YOU DROPPED THEM?

24:38.177 --> 24:40.647
- CRAPPY PART OF TOWN.
- BE MORE SPECIFIC?

24:40.680 --> 24:43.816
- SOUTH BRONX.
THE PLACE LOOKED CONDEMNED.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.021
[distant sirens wailing]

25:06.973 --> 25:08.608
- SARAH?

25:10.643 --> 25:12.879
SARAH?

25:15.314 --> 25:19.018
HOPE YOU GOT US
SOMETHIN' TO EAT.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.924
OLIVIA.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.093
[sniffs]
IS THAT REALLY YOU?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.862
- IT'S REALLY ME.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.602
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID,
VIVIAN...

25:35.635 --> 25:37.036
PLEASE.

25:37.069 --> 25:40.006
- LITTLE LATE FOR THAT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

25:40.039 --> 25:41.941
- NO.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.309
[knife clatters]

25:43.342 --> 25:44.811
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

25:44.844 --> 25:48.981
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, VIVIAN,
TO HELP YOU.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.986
- YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN HELP ME?
LEAVE. PLEASE LEAVE.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.956
- I DO THAT, AND YOU DIE.

25:56.989 --> 26:00.326
- THE BIGGEST HELP OF ALL.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.730
- TURN AROUND.
I GOTTA CUFF YOU.

26:03.763 --> 26:04.931
- NO, NO!

26:04.964 --> 26:08.200
EVERYTHING! YOU!
YOU RUIN EVERYTHING!

26:08.234 --> 26:10.703
WHEREVER MY HOME IS,
YOU--YOU COME IN

26:10.737 --> 26:12.138
A-AND YOU PISS ALL OVER IT!

26:12.171 --> 26:13.873
- THIS IS YOUR HOME?

26:13.906 --> 26:15.675
- OH, I'M SORRY
IT'S NOT AS NICE

26:15.708 --> 26:16.776
AS YOUR HOME, MAYBE,

26:16.809 --> 26:19.779
BUT IT'S WHERE MY--
MY HEART IS, MINE AND SARAH'S.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.048
AND YOU WALK IN HERE,

26:22.081 --> 26:23.683
AND YOU STOMP ON IT!
- CALM DOWN, VIVIAN.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.818
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE I WAS IN
A BAD PLACE BEFORE YOU MET ME,

26:25.852 --> 26:28.020
BUT AT LEAST
I KNEW WHO I WAS.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.355
AT LEAST I KNEW
WHERE I CAME FROM.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.957
A-AND YOU STOLE THAT
AWAY FROM ME!

26:30.990 --> 26:33.893
- THE TRUTH IS HARD, VIVIAN,
I KNOW THAT.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.062
- STOP! STOP SAYING
YOU KNOW WHO I AM

26:36.095 --> 26:37.363
AND THAT WE'RE SO MUCH ALIKE

26:37.396 --> 26:39.265
BECAUSE BOTH OF OUR DADDIES
WERE RAPISTS.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.734
I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:41.768 --> 26:44.637
I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU!

26:44.671 --> 26:46.673
- VIVIAN ARLISS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

26:46.706 --> 26:47.940
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.209
- LISTEN TO ME, JUST WALK AWAY.
- ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL

26:50.242 --> 26:52.044
BE USED AGAINST YOU
IN A COURT OF LAW.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.413
- SARAH AND I ARE HAPPY.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.983
I SWEAR WE'RE NOT GONNA
DO ANYTHING TO ANYONE.

26:57.016 --> 26:57.917
- VIVIAN, LISTEN TO ME.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.186
YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS!

27:00.219 --> 27:02.054
- AND YOU--

27:02.088 --> 27:04.924
YOU DESERVE CALVIN.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.126
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
ISN'T IT?

27:07.159 --> 27:09.428
YOU WANNA KEEP HIM.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.732
IF YOU WALK AWAY RIGHT NOW,
I PROMISE YOU CAN HAVE HIM.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.901
CALVIN CAN BE YOUR
LITTLE BOY FOREVER--

27:14.934 --> 27:16.836
I-I PROMISE YOU, OKAY?

27:16.869 --> 27:19.438
OKAY? COME ON, OLIVIA, PLEASE.
- STOP THIS TALK AND JUST--

27:19.471 --> 27:22.374
- OKAY, OLIVIA,
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.143
AND THAT'S WHY
I LEFT HIM WITH YOU,

27:24.176 --> 27:27.013
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
HE WOULD BE HAPPY WITH YOU.

27:27.046 --> 27:30.116
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT?
YOU WANT CALVIN TO BE HAPPY.

27:32.819 --> 27:36.255
RIGHT?

27:36.288 --> 27:38.057
Stabler:
WELL, LIV, MAKE A DECISION.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.068
YOUR CALL.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.109
- IT'S TIME TO TELL US

27:57.143 --> 27:59.211
WHAT HAPPENED
TO WALTER BURLOCK, VIVIAN.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.280
COME ON.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.783
LET'S GO.
- PLEASE...

28:06.185 --> 28:08.821
WHAT'S THERE TO TELL?
I DON'T KNOW.

28:10.422 --> 28:13.159
I, UM...

28:13.192 --> 28:16.295
I KNOCKED ON
HIS FRONT DOOR AND...

28:16.328 --> 28:18.998
HE ANSWERED WITH THIS
BIG GRIN ON HIS FACE.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.900
HE MIGHT HAVE EVEN
LICKED HIS LIPS.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.869
- DID YOU INVITE
YOURSELF IN?

28:22.902 --> 28:25.972
- MM-MM.
HE INVITED.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.974
HE TOLD ME TO SIT

28:28.007 --> 28:30.509
WHILE HE GRABBED US
A COUPLE OF BEERS.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.444
AND I SAID, UM...
[clears throat]

28:32.478 --> 28:34.981
I SAID A WOMAN
SHOULD SERVE A MAN.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.215
HE LIKED THAT.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.052
AND THEN I...WALKED INTO
THE KITCHEN

28:40.086 --> 28:43.022
AND SAW THE FRYING PAN
ON THE STOVE.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.293
- AND YOU PICKED IT UP?

28:49.095 --> 28:52.431
- AFTER I PUT ON AN OVEN MITT.

28:52.464 --> 28:56.068
AND THEN BURLOCK WALKED IN
AND...

28:56.102 --> 28:58.871
SMASHED HIS SKULL.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.908
AND THEN HE FELL ON THE CARPET

29:01.941 --> 29:05.044
AND STARTED MAKING THESE WEIRD
GURGLING NOISES AND STUFF,

29:05.077 --> 29:06.879
AND THEN...

29:06.913 --> 29:09.916
I HIT HIM AGAIN,
AND HE STOPPED.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.086
I KILLED THE BASTARD.

29:17.323 --> 29:20.960
THE FACT THAT HE WAS MY FATHER
ONLY MADE IT BETTER.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.300
- BOTH OF YOU OUT. NOW.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.471
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING?

29:32.504 --> 29:35.507
COULD I HAVE BEEN ANY CLEARER
ABOUT YOU STANDING DOWN?

29:35.541 --> 29:37.209
- I'M SORRY.
- SORRY IS NOT EVEN

29:37.243 --> 29:39.245
IN THE BALLPARK
OF WHERE YOU NEED TO BE.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.813
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?

29:40.847 --> 29:41.981
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO COLLARED VIVIAN.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.415
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE WANTED?

29:43.449 --> 29:45.084
- YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
ESCAPE A RIP HERE?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.119
YOU DEFIED A DIRECT ORDER
JUST LIKE SHE DID.

29:47.153 --> 29:50.589
AND YOU TWO KNEW SHE WAS AWOL
AND YOU CALLED HIM, NOT ME.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.024
- WE JUST TRIED TO MAKE
THE PLAY, CAPTAIN.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.893
- THIS IS ON ME.
IT'S NOT ON THEM.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.427
- PLAYING THE MARTYR
IS NOT GONNA WORK HERE.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.096
EVERYBODY'S GETTING BURNED
THIS TIME.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.064
- EVEN THOUGH IT'S A WIN?

29:58.097 --> 29:59.966
BECAUSE VIVIAN
JUST TOLD US THE WHOLE STORY

29:59.999 --> 30:01.934
ABOUT KILLING BURLOCK.
- ANY HALF-ASSED ATTORNEY

30:01.968 --> 30:03.970
WILL HAVE HER RECANTING
THAT CONFESSION

30:04.003 --> 30:07.206
BEFORE SHE LEAVES THAT ROOM.
- GOOD.

30:07.239 --> 30:08.908
- SARAH.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.010
- BECAUSE VIVIAN
DIDN'T KILL WALTER BURLOCK.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.815
- I DID.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.326
- I'M GLAD I DID IT.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.628
- SO YOU ADMIT
TO KILLING WALTER BURLOCK?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.063
- ABSOLUTELY.

30:31.097 --> 30:33.299
- AND VIVIAN CONFESSED
TO A CRIME YOU COMMITTED

30:33.332 --> 30:34.533
BECAUSE...

30:34.566 --> 30:39.071
- I LOVE SARAH.

30:39.105 --> 30:41.540
HER HEART IS...SO PURE.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.610
- WHEN SHE'S NOT
MURDERING MEN.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.546
- SHE ONLY DID THAT
BECAUSE SHE LOVES ME.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.548
- VIVIAN IS THE ONLY PERSON

30:49.581 --> 30:52.484
WHO ACCEPTS ME
FOR WHO I AM.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.555
I KNEW WE WERE SOUL MATES
THE MOMENT WE MET

30:56.588 --> 30:58.624
EIGHT YEARS AGO IN REHAB.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.659
- AND HOW'D THAT WORK OUT?

31:00.692 --> 31:04.530
- WE'VE HAD OUR SLIPS...
OBVIOUSLY.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.234
BUT VIVIAN WOULDN'T HAVE
SLIPPED THIS TIME

31:08.267 --> 31:09.335
OR RUN AWAY

31:09.368 --> 31:12.404
IF SHE HADN'T JUST FOUND OUT
WHO HER REAL FATHER WAS.

31:12.438 --> 31:15.141
- SARAH KILLED BURLOCK

31:15.174 --> 31:18.410
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT
IT WOULD TAKE MY PAIN AWAY.

31:18.444 --> 31:21.280
- AND DID IT?

31:22.581 --> 31:25.417
- I'LL NEVER BE FREE OF PAIN.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.620
- VIVIAN FEELS MORE DEEPLY

31:28.654 --> 31:31.590
THAN ANYONE
YOU'LL EVER KNOW.

31:31.623 --> 31:34.526
PAIN.

31:34.560 --> 31:38.364
LOVE.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.267
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.472
BUT I'D FOLLOW HER ANYWHERE.

31:46.505 --> 31:50.642
- WE'LL ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.

31:50.676 --> 31:53.179
EVEN IF WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.649
FOREVER.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.988
- CODEPENDENT
AND DRUG DEPENDENT.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.956
[click]
IT'S LIKE SID AND NANCY.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.724
EXCEPT THEY'RE BOTH NANCY.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.726
- VIVIAN NEVER ONCE
MENTIONED CALVIN.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.361
Stabler: STRUNG OUT AS SHE IS?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.697
I'D BE SURPRISED IF SHE'D
EVEN REMEMBER HIS NAME.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.332
OKAY, SO SARAH'S GOING DOWN
FOR OFFING BURLOCK.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.733
WHAT ABOUT VIVIAN?

32:14.766 --> 32:17.469
- I'LL CHARGE HER FOR STEALING
DRUGS FROM THE DONOHOS.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.571
COURT WILL ORDER REHAB
AT THE VERY LEAST.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.340
- OKAY.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.542
- VIVIAN GOT MONEY
WHEN HER MOM DIED.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.345
SHE'LL MAKE BAIL
IN FIVE MINUTES.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.714
- AND BE BACK ON DRUGS
IN TEN.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.155
- ON THE CHARGE OF MURDER

32:36.188 --> 32:37.589
IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

32:37.623 --> 32:39.658
HOW DOES THE DEFENDANT PLEAD?

32:39.691 --> 32:41.327
- MY CLIENT PLEADS NOT GUILTY,
YOUR HONOR.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.129
HER CONFESSION WAS COERCED
WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.364
- THE PEOPLE
WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY

32:45.397 --> 32:46.765
PROVING MS. HOYT'S GUILT
WITHOUT IT.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.135
- BAIL, MS. HARDWICKE?
- $500,000.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.637
MS. HOYT HAS ALREADY PROVEN
THAT SHE'S A FLIGHT RISK.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.740
- REMEDIED WHEN SHE VOLUNTARILY
TURNED HERSELF IN TO THE POLICE.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.042
WHICH WAS ILL-ADVISED,

32:56.075 --> 32:57.576
SEEING AS ONE OF
THE ARRESTING OFFICERS,

32:57.609 --> 33:00.179
DETECTIVE OLIVIA BENSON,
HAS A SPECIAL INTEREST

33:00.212 --> 33:01.547
IN KEEPING MY CLIENT IN JAIL

33:01.580 --> 33:03.682
BECAUSE SHE HAS CUSTODY
OF THE SON--

33:03.715 --> 33:04.550
- ARE WE ARGUING THE CASE
ALREADY?

33:04.583 --> 33:07.686
- MR. HUNTER,
SAVE IT FOR THE JURY.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.788
BAIL IS SET AT $300,000.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.390
[taps gavel]

33:11.423 --> 33:12.691
- DON'T WORRY, BABY.

33:12.724 --> 33:14.160
I'LL GET YOU OUT, OKAY?

33:14.193 --> 33:16.462
- [whimpering]

33:29.441 --> 33:31.643
- HEY, YOU GO GET
THE CAR, OKAY?

33:31.677 --> 33:34.012
I'LL JUST BE A SECOND.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.551
I THOUGHT YOU GOT
KICKED OFF THE CASE.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.687
- I DID.
PROSECUTORS HAVE IT NOW.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.156
- SHE'S NOT GONNA WIN.
WE ARE.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.825
- VIVIAN, I JUST CAME
TO SEE IF...

33:46.858 --> 33:49.695
IF YOU'RE OKAY.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.297
- I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.665
'CAUSE I WANNA SEE CALVIN.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.670
- I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S
A GREAT IDEA, VIVIAN.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.573
CALVIN'S DOING REALLY WELL.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.609
- AND I'M HIS MOTHER,
AND I LOVE HIM.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.611
- MORE THAN YOU LOVE SARAH?

34:05.644 --> 34:08.747
OR DRUGS?
- IS THAT WHO I AM?

34:08.780 --> 34:10.216
- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.251
- HA HA.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.752
MAYBE I DON'T LOVE CALVIN.

34:13.785 --> 34:14.586
MAYBE I DON'T LOVE ANYONE

34:14.620 --> 34:16.855
UNLESS I CAN GET
WHAT I NEED, RIGHT?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.590
- WHAT YOU NEED
IS TO GET HELP, VIVIAN.

34:18.624 --> 34:19.791
LIKE I GOT.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.793
- NOT EVERYONE
CAN BE HELPED, OLIVIA.

34:21.827 --> 34:25.063
SOME OF US
ARE JUST TOO DAMAGED.

34:27.366 --> 34:30.469
NOT THAT YOU DID ME ANY FAVORS.
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

34:30.502 --> 34:33.639
[gunshots]

34:33.672 --> 34:35.741
- STAY HERE!

34:37.576 --> 34:38.710
SVU PORTABLE TO CENTRAL.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.213
SHOTS FIRED.
[horn blaring]

34:41.247 --> 34:42.614
WEST COURTHOUSE STEPS.

34:42.648 --> 34:45.217
I NEED BACKUP AND A BUS NOW.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.785
- SARAH?

34:47.786 --> 34:49.721
[horn stops]

34:49.755 --> 34:50.722
NO!
- NO, NO, VIVIAN--

34:50.756 --> 34:52.391
- SARAH!
- DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.625
- SARAH!

34:53.659 --> 34:55.627
THIS IS BECAUSE OF YOU!

34:55.661 --> 34:58.230
EVERYTHING BAD
IS BECAUSE OF YOU!

34:58.264 --> 34:59.598
- I'M SORRY, VIVIAN.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.102
- CHECK THIS OUT.

35:07.173 --> 35:08.274
- JASON GAMBEL.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.576
THAT GUY WAS TERRORIZED
BY HIS CELLMATE WALTER BURLOCK.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.244
- NO OTHER CAMERAS
IN THE GARAGE,

35:12.278 --> 35:13.745
BUT THIS DOORWAY IS 50 FEET

35:13.779 --> 35:15.614
AWAY FROM WHERE SARAH
WAS GUNNED DOWN.

35:15.647 --> 35:16.782
GAMBEL'S OUR GUY.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.618
- SO SARAH KILLED BURLOCK
FOR RAPING VIVIAN'S MOTHER,

35:19.651 --> 35:24.390
AND NOW GAMBEL KILLS SARAH
FOR MURDERING HIS MASTER.

35:24.423 --> 35:25.724
- EVEN IN DEATH,

35:25.757 --> 35:28.760
BURLOCK STILL HAS AN IRON GRIP
ON HIS PRISON BITCH.

35:28.794 --> 35:29.928
- BUT I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.630
- SARAH HOYT DOESN'T COUNT
AS ANYONE?

35:31.663 --> 35:34.400
ONLY BURLOCK MAKES THE GRADE
IN YOUR SAD LITTLE WORLD?

35:34.433 --> 35:37.569
- NO. I HATED BURLOCK.
I STILL DO.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.305
- WELL, GAMBEL,
WE CAUGHT YOU ON TAPE

35:39.338 --> 35:40.539
HAULING ASS FROM THAT GARAGE

35:40.572 --> 35:41.873
AFTER YOU PUMPED
THREE SLUGS INTO SARAH.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.942
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
I WAS OUTSIDE COURT TODAY.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.577
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIE?

35:45.611 --> 35:46.912
WELL, MY PARTNER
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.547
- I STAYED BACK.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.616
ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS FIND
THE GIRL WHO KILLED BURLOCK.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.219
SHE SET ME FREE.
I CAN FINALLY SLEEP AT NIGHT.

35:53.252 --> 35:55.654
BUT BEFORE I COULD,
A GUY WALKED UP TO HER CAR.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.223
I COULD ONLY SEE HIM
FROM THE BACK.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.924
HE SHOT THREE TIMES,

35:58.957 --> 36:00.492
AND THEN HE LEANED
INTO THE WINDOW

36:00.526 --> 36:01.660
AND SPIT IN HER FACE.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.562
THEN HE TURNED TOWARDS ME,
SO I RAN.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.664
- I TELL YOU WHAT--YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

36:05.697 --> 36:07.866
TO TELL THAT STORY TO A JURY,
AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BELIEVE YOU

36:07.899 --> 36:09.701
AS MUCH AS I DO.
- NO! I SWEAR

36:09.735 --> 36:12.971
I DIDN'T KILL THAT GIRL!
- HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.607
- BURLOCK GET HIS HOOKS
INTO YOU TOO?

36:15.641 --> 36:16.975
- DNA DID.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.545
FROM THE SALIVA WE FOUND
ON SARAH HOYT'S FACE.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.680
- IT'S NOT A MATCH
TO THAT GUY?

36:21.713 --> 36:23.549
- NOT EVEN CLOSE.

36:23.582 --> 36:26.818
BUT IT MATCHES HALF OF ANOTHER
DNA SAMPLE I JUST GOT BACK,

36:26.852 --> 36:28.587
THE ONE YOU DROPPED OFF?

36:28.620 --> 36:30.989
THE MAN WHO SHOT SARAH HOYT--

36:31.022 --> 36:33.425
- IS CALVIN'S FATHER.

36:33.459 --> 36:35.327
DAVID DRUCKER!

36:35.361 --> 36:36.928
WE HAVE A WARRANT
FOR YOUR ARREST.

36:36.962 --> 36:38.497
- DON'T WORRY.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.766
I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT YOU.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.734
THERE'S THE GUN
I SHOT HER WITH.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.236
IT'S UNLOADED.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.605
Benson: STAND UP.
HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE 'EM.

36:49.575 --> 36:51.743
OH, SO YOU'VE BEEN
WAITIN' FOR US.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.679
- I KNOW WHAT I DID WAS WRONG.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.447
- WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
FIGURED THAT OUT

36:55.481 --> 36:57.015
BEFORE YOU KILLED SARAH.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.651
- SHE STOLE VIVIAN FROM ME.

36:59.685 --> 37:00.886
AND MY SON.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.954
- VIVIAN SAID YOU DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT CALVIN.

37:02.988 --> 37:04.423
- AND YOU BELIEVE HER?

37:04.456 --> 37:06.925
THE WAY SHE IS NOW?

37:06.958 --> 37:09.495
MAYBE AT FIRST I WASN'T
TOO GOOD A DAD,

37:09.528 --> 37:11.430
BUT I GOT CLEAN.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.432
CONVINCED HER TO GO
TO REHAB TOO.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.867
- WHERE SHE MET SARAH.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.404
- I COULDN'T GIVE VIVIAN
WHAT SHE COULD.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.971
- 'CAUSE THEY'RE BOTH
STILL ADDICTS.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.474
- SARAH PULLED VIVIAN

37:22.508 --> 37:24.610
BACK DOWN THE HOLE.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.378
AND THEN THEY TOOK OFF.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.947
THEY TOOK CALVIN WITH 'EM.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.616
EVERY TIME I TRACKED
VIVIAN DOWN,

37:30.649 --> 37:32.484
I-I PLEADED WITH HER...

37:32.518 --> 37:35.954
PLEASE JUST...COME HOME.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.957
AT LEAST...
LET ME TAKE THE BOY.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.328
SARAH WOULDN'T LET HER.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.829
S-SHE JUST KEPT

37:43.862 --> 37:47.566
FILLING VIVIAN UP
WITH DRUGS.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.769
- THEN YOU SAW THE NEWS REPORTS
OF SARAH'S ARREST.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.040
- THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

A MISTAKE.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.736
THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE
BECAUSE THAT WOMAN RIGHT THERE

38:57.769 --> 38:59.505
IS A CRIMINAL

39:37.208 --> 39:39.177
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
SHIPPING HIM OFF TO VERMONT.

IT'S THE BEST THING FOR HIM.
