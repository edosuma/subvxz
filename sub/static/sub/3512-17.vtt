WEBVTT

00:00.437 --> 00:03.035
This is heaven.

00:03.069 --> 00:05.454
This is absolute heaven.

00:05.521 --> 00:07.955
Yeah, you mean spending the day
with your future husband?

00:07.990 --> 00:09.241
No, no. Not that.

00:09.275 --> 00:10.726
Not that?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.544
No, no, no. I mean, not only that.

00:12.595 --> 00:13.896
It's 2:00.

00:13.930 --> 00:14.880
I'm in my P.J.s.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.632
We're reading the newspapers.

00:16.666 --> 00:17.933
I never get to do this.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.401
Because you never take any time off.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.086
All we have to do is loaf around.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.939
There's no work, no goals other
than to waste hours on end.

00:23.973 --> 00:25.724
Okay. Stop describing my life.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.510
Though there is one thing
we should get done today.

00:28.545 --> 00:31.780
We need to pick a font
for our "save the date" cards.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.432
Really? We're gonna do that?

00:33.466 --> 00:35.317
We don't even have a venue yet.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.603
Yeah. I find deadlines... inspiring.

00:37.637 --> 00:38.887
How about this one?

00:38.922 --> 00:40.656
No. It's too frilly.

00:40.690 --> 00:41.657
Agreed.

00:41.691 --> 00:44.476
And this...
ooh, this is... far too severe.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.445
You will save the date <i>now.</i>

00:48.014 --> 00:50.365
Oh, I like that one. You?

00:50.400 --> 00:51.867
Mm, I'm not really feeling it,

00:51.901 --> 00:54.720
though I guess, uh,
you could convince me.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.972
I bet I could.

00:57.006 --> 00:58.941
Yeah, I mean,
you'd have to work pretty hard

00:58.975 --> 01:00.242
to win me over, but, um...

01:00.260 --> 01:01.927
Well, I'm prepared to do just that.

01:01.961 --> 01:05.531
Because it's clear to me
that what we both need right now

01:05.565 --> 01:07.015
is a really good font.

01:07.050 --> 01:09.017
Yes, we do. That's so true.

01:09.869 --> 01:12.187
Oh!

01:12.222 --> 01:14.189
And worst timing ever.

01:17.293 --> 01:19.445
Beckett.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.996
Detective, how soon can you get here?

01:21.014 --> 01:23.265
Uh, sir, I'm actually not on call today.

01:23.299 --> 01:25.267
I'm aware of that,
but something has come up,

01:25.301 --> 01:26.318
and I'm afraid it can't wait.

01:26.369 --> 01:28.087
Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.

01:28.938 --> 01:30.906
One more thing... come alone.

01:30.940 --> 01:33.058
Do not bring Mr. Castle.

01:33.109 --> 01:34.877
Uh... Yes, sir.

01:36.045 --> 01:37.062
So, what's Gates up to

01:37.113 --> 01:38.997
aside from sabotaging
our domestic bliss?

01:39.032 --> 01:39.965
I don't know.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.950
- But I got to go.
- Huh.

01:41.985 --> 01:43.035
I don't suppose I could convince
you to just...

01:43.086 --> 01:44.470
- No. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.938
Yeah. Don't worry. It's fine.

01:45.972 --> 01:48.073
Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.109
I'll just, uh... I'll do some writing...

01:50.160 --> 01:53.445
If I can... manage to focus.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.585
Yo, Beckett. I thought you were off.

01:59.636 --> 02:01.203
Was that the deputy commissioner?

02:01.221 --> 02:02.738
Yeah, there's been more brass
through here

02:02.772 --> 02:03.805
than a marching band. What's going on?

02:03.823 --> 02:05.157
It's all need-to-know,

02:05.208 --> 02:06.875
and we didn't make the list.
But whatever's happening

02:06.893 --> 02:08.372
is going down in that conference room.

02:08.411 --> 02:09.511
Detective.

02:09.545 --> 02:10.262
- Yep.
- Yep.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.581
- Beckett.
- Sorry.

02:12.615 --> 02:14.316
Yeah.

02:14.350 --> 02:15.851
Detective Beckett,

02:15.885 --> 02:17.919
Captain Fowler, head of narcotics.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.205
Thank you for coming, detective.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.656
Mm-hmm.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.492
What I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

02:23.526 --> 02:25.160
Yeah. Understood, sir.

02:25.178 --> 02:28.396
These six victims had their throats cut.

02:28.414 --> 02:30.682
They were mid-to upper-level
drug dealers.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.683
Two were teenagers.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.569
They were all murdered
in the past few months

02:33.603 --> 02:35.003
when a new drug ring muscled in

02:35.038 --> 02:37.439
and took over most of the uptown
heroin and cocaine trade.

02:37.473 --> 02:38.874
A new drug ring?

02:38.908 --> 02:40.609
Well, who are they?

02:40.643 --> 02:42.611
The commissioner asked me
to find that out

02:42.645 --> 02:44.997
and shut them down, but they're
invisible, these guys.

02:45.031 --> 02:47.316
They don't use banks,
so we can't follow the money.

02:47.350 --> 02:48.884
They make sure their street dealers

02:48.918 --> 02:50.018
never meet their suppliers.

02:50.053 --> 02:51.052
So, when you bust a dealer,

02:51.070 --> 02:52.550
he doesn't know who he's working for.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.488
Exactly.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.274
So, three months in,
and we have nothing.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.277
We don't even know any of their
names, except for Lazarus.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.295
- And who is Lazarus?
- The leader.

03:00.330 --> 03:02.381
Not his real name, of course.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.566
Then yesterday, a phone intercept

03:04.584 --> 03:08.303
led us to this woman... Elena Markov.

03:08.338 --> 03:10.889
She copped to being a low-level
drug courier in the ring.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.258
Born in Russia, she came here
as a mail-order bride,

03:13.293 --> 03:14.726
divorced her husband.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.828
She learned to speak English
better than we do

03:16.880 --> 03:19.147
and was getting by
as a freelance translator.

03:19.182 --> 03:22.267
She'd never been in trouble
before, at least not till now.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.722
<i>I needed work, and I heard
about a way to make money.</i>

03:26.756 --> 03:29.441
<i>All I had to do</i>
<i>was call a number, so I did.</i>

03:29.475 --> 03:31.843
<i>But once I got in, I couldn't get out.</i>

03:31.878 --> 03:33.545
<i>Who was your contact in the ring?</i>

03:33.580 --> 03:35.030
<i>I didn't have one.</i>

03:35.064 --> 03:37.532
<i>I would get a text</i>
<i>with a time and a place,</i>

03:37.550 --> 03:39.201
<i>and I'd get a package</i>
<i>with a note hidden inside</i>

03:39.235 --> 03:40.569
<i>that would tell me where to take it.</i>

03:40.603 --> 03:42.571
<i>Did you ever, um, see anyone?</i>

03:42.605 --> 03:44.773
Did you ever interact <i>with anyone?</i>

03:44.791 --> 03:46.074
<i>No. Everything was anonymous.</i>

03:46.092 --> 03:47.759
<i>I don't know them. They don't know me.</i>

03:47.794 --> 03:50.362
<i>It... it needs to stay that way.</i>

03:50.396 --> 03:56.001
<i>Look, I... I just want to get my life back.</i>

03:56.052 --> 03:57.619
It looked like another dead end.

03:57.637 --> 04:00.221
Then this morning, Elena got
another text from the ring.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.258
This time, they wanted to meet
her to offer her a promotion.

04:03.292 --> 04:06.078
Which would give you guys a
chance to get eyes on someone.

04:06.112 --> 04:07.679
It's the break we've been waiting for.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.631
So, we leveraged Elena to take the meet,

04:09.666 --> 04:11.366
but she tried to commit suicide.

04:11.401 --> 04:14.119
She's in intensive care
under police guard.

04:14.153 --> 04:16.036
Sir, I'm sorry to hear about that,

04:16.055 --> 04:18.305
but what does this all
have to do with me?

04:20.515 --> 04:21.875
The meeting is set for 5:00 today,

04:21.894 --> 04:24.062
and a chance like this
is not gonna come back around,

04:24.097 --> 04:27.332
so we combed the NYPD database
for someone about Elena's age

04:27.383 --> 04:29.735
and appearance
who speaks fluent Russian,

04:29.769 --> 04:32.170
in case that's relevant.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.223
Only one name came up... yours.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.726
You want me to go in her place?

04:37.760 --> 04:38.810
To the Widmark.

04:38.845 --> 04:41.079
Show up, meet your contact, and leave.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.214
In and out.

04:42.265 --> 04:44.283
What if they found out
that you turned Elena

04:44.317 --> 04:45.751
and that this is all a trap?

04:45.785 --> 04:48.086
Then they wouldn't be meeting
at the Widmark Hotel.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.237
We were very careful.

04:49.271 --> 04:51.373
No one knows she's made contact with us.

04:51.391 --> 04:54.343
Still, there's the risk that
they could see detective Beckett

04:54.377 --> 04:56.128
and realize that she's not Elena.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.430
In the text, they asked Elena
to wear a red scarf,

04:58.464 --> 05:00.716
which tells us that they don't
know her on sight.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.669
My people will be in place
watching every move you make.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.971
We can even fit you with
a monitored mike, if you like.

05:06.022 --> 05:07.039
I...

05:07.073 --> 05:10.692
Detective, something big
is going on out there,

05:10.727 --> 05:12.627
and this is our best chance
to find out what.

05:12.662 --> 05:18.216
But the meeting's in two hours,
so I need your answer.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.671
<i>Reinforcements.</i>

05:22.705 --> 05:24.573
Castle.

05:24.607 --> 05:27.693
Wow. You sound like you are
getting a lot of writing done.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.910
I blame you for that.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.211
When are you coming back?

05:30.229 --> 05:31.863
Uh, I don't know. A couple hours?

05:31.914 --> 05:33.332
I have a meeting.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.216
A... and don't ask me what it is.

05:35.234 --> 05:37.419
Well, now I have to ask.

05:37.453 --> 05:39.671
It... Look, I... I have to get going.

05:39.722 --> 05:40.989
I should be back in time for dinner.

05:41.024 --> 05:42.323
Maybe we can have
a glass of wine together.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.309
I will decant something amazing.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.795
Okay. I love you. Bye.

05:47.997 --> 05:49.348
I have to tell you I don't care

05:49.382 --> 05:51.550
for Captain Fowler's hard-sell tactics.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.335
This is a narcotics operation.

05:53.369 --> 05:54.503
It's not your problem,

05:54.537 --> 05:56.257
so you can walk away
and I'll take the heat.

05:56.271 --> 05:57.832
Thank you, sir, but I... I can handle this.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.825
Then they're ready to review the plan

05:59.876 --> 06:01.393
and give you a final briefing.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.864
Remember, don't move like a cop.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.653
You're Elena. You're intimidated
by these guys.

06:11.687 --> 06:14.873
They've been leveraging you
for two months.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.682
There will be five plainclothes
officers in the lobby

06:23.733 --> 06:25.984
and more throughout the hotel.

06:28.604 --> 06:30.956
Head to the north elevator
and go to the 11th floor.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.426
The meet is in room 1123.

06:34.460 --> 06:37.679
Undercover officers up there
will have your back.

06:37.713 --> 06:41.083
Stay calm, memorize names
and faces of whomever you meet,

06:41.117 --> 06:42.784
and you'll be out in no time.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.622
- Hello.
- Hi.

06:47.656 --> 06:48.723
Which floor?

06:48.757 --> 06:50.825
11.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.061
Okay.

06:57.967 --> 07:00.435
Don't move a muscle.

07:04.273 --> 07:06.908
Elevator just got to 11.

07:10.580 --> 07:11.613
It's empty.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.082
She's not here. She is not here.

07:15.901 --> 07:20.401
Castle 6x17 - In the Belly of the Beast

Sync and corrections by atrn97g

07:24.436 --> 07:26.807
This is detective Kate Beckett.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.064
If you can hear me, I've been abducted.

07:29.098 --> 07:31.066
I'm in a white cube van,
New York plates.

07:31.100 --> 07:34.069
We've been traveling
for about 20 minutes.

07:34.103 --> 07:36.021
We've been making a lot of turns,

07:36.055 --> 07:38.607
but I think we're headed east.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.742
Captain Fowler, if you can hear me,

07:40.777 --> 07:43.245
this is seriously ruining
my dinner plans.

07:43.279 --> 07:45.614
You promised me that you had her back.

07:45.665 --> 07:46.615
What happened?

07:46.666 --> 07:48.607
We were set up for a simple meet,

07:48.638 --> 07:50.491
not an orchestrated kidnapping.

07:50.506 --> 07:52.788
The security cameras... did they
get a shot of who did this?

07:52.812 --> 07:54.507
They were disabled momentarily
throughout the hotel.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.258
What about the mike Beckett had on?

07:56.292 --> 07:58.794
We stopped receiving audio
after she got in the elevator.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.846
The signal strength drops
in enclosed spaces.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.431
And let me guess...

08:02.465 --> 08:06.736
whoever was in room 1123
didn't know about a meeting

08:06.770 --> 08:08.938
because there never was gonna be one.

08:08.972 --> 08:10.272
Look, we've issued a limited alert.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.857
Limited alert?!

08:11.908 --> 08:13.576
We need to call in the cavalry here.

08:13.610 --> 08:16.612
We know the drug ring
tracks police radios.

08:16.646 --> 08:19.248
Sending up a flare
could make things worse.

08:19.282 --> 08:21.650
They must have known
that your girl rolled on them,

08:21.668 --> 08:22.668
or they made Beckett.

08:22.703 --> 08:23.786
Either way, she's dead

08:23.820 --> 08:26.088
if we don't find her immediately.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.711
Gentlemen, we have a situation.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.349
We've been driving for about
an hour now, maybe more.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.684
Uh, two-lane road,
not a lot of traffic, um...

08:42.672 --> 08:44.173
We're slowing down.

08:47.044 --> 08:48.611
We've stopped.

08:48.645 --> 08:50.363
I've got to get rid of this thing.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.648
<i>Get on your knees and face</i>
<i>the wall toward the cab.</i>

08:52.682 --> 08:54.450
<i>Do not move.</i>

09:00.323 --> 09:03.225
Don't turn around.

09:09.616 --> 09:12.568
Time to see if you're wearing a wire.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.387
I'm not wearing a wire.

09:14.438 --> 09:16.772
Yeah, we'll see about that.

09:55.378 --> 09:56.979
This is detective Kate Beckett.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.698
<i>I'm unavailable at the moment,</i>
<i>but please leave a message.</i>

10:02.285 --> 10:06.422
Well, I know you have plans
with Katherine this evening,

10:06.456 --> 10:09.258
so I'm going to make myself scarce.

10:09.292 --> 10:11.043
Oh, very nice.

10:11.094 --> 10:13.462
I'm off to a revival
of "Brighton Beach Memoirs."

10:13.496 --> 10:15.014
Ha. Pray for me.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.099
What's the matter?

10:17.134 --> 10:19.001
I... I can't get ahold of Beckett.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.853
I texted her. I left messages.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.054
This isn't like her.

10:22.065 --> 10:23.585
Maybe she got tied up at the precinct.

10:23.607 --> 10:24.887
Have you tried Ryan or Esposito?

10:24.891 --> 10:26.642
I called them both...
just go straight to voice-mail.

10:26.676 --> 10:31.096
Just... something is not right.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.913
So, what happens now?

11:03.947 --> 11:07.166
It's not my call.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.323
Is that who we're waiting for?

11:14.357 --> 11:17.209
They're in that room?

11:17.244 --> 11:19.595
You sound worried.

11:21.698 --> 11:23.232
Should I be?

11:23.266 --> 11:26.969
What the hell makes you so special?

11:27.003 --> 11:28.137
I'm not special.

11:28.171 --> 11:31.140
I don't know anything.
I just move packages.

11:31.174 --> 11:32.925
I'm not a threat to anyone.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.060
You can just drop the act.

11:50.327 --> 11:52.361
Let's go. You're up.

12:45.114 --> 12:48.334
You are Elena Markov?

12:53.923 --> 12:56.075
Yes.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.266
It's good to finally meet you.

13:04.301 --> 13:09.054
You can call me Mr. Jones,
and this is Mr. Harden.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.356
Hey.

13:10.407 --> 13:12.675
I'm sorry for the lengths
we go to to have a meeting,

13:12.709 --> 13:14.576
but these are the times we live in.

13:14.611 --> 13:16.545
Uh, can I get you anything? A drink?

13:16.579 --> 13:18.781
No. Thank you.

13:18.815 --> 13:20.799
Good. To business, then.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.706
You should know how much
we value your services,

13:27.741 --> 13:29.758
Lazarus in particular.

13:29.793 --> 13:32.895
Well, I do the best I can.

13:32.929 --> 13:34.713
But always as a freelancer.

13:34.764 --> 13:36.048
What we want to do

13:36.082 --> 13:38.951
is offer you a permanent position

13:38.985 --> 13:42.004
with our organization.

13:48.878 --> 13:51.413
That's per week, of course.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.785
How does that strike you?

13:56.820 --> 13:59.888
It's very generous.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.942
But I'm gonna need to meet Lazarus.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.949
That's not an option.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.002
I need to know
who I'm doing business with.

14:14.037 --> 14:15.621
It's a matter of trust.

14:17.841 --> 14:19.341
All right.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.176
I'll pass along the request,

14:21.211 --> 14:24.596
but you'll remain our guest here
until I get an answer.

14:24.647 --> 14:27.116
Please see Miss Markov to a bedroom.

14:27.150 --> 14:29.868
Sir, can I have a word, please?

14:29.903 --> 14:31.070
Sure.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.871
Would you excuse me, please?

14:32.906 --> 14:34.689
Yes.

14:50.907 --> 14:52.591
- What's the problem?
- She's the problem.

14:52.625 --> 14:53.659
She's all wrong.

15:03.586 --> 15:05.537
Look, I've been watching her.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.873
She acted like she didn't know
why she was here.

15:10.026 --> 15:11.760
Esposito.

15:11.794 --> 15:12.778
Javi, Javi, it's me.

15:12.812 --> 15:13.862
Beckett, where are you?

15:13.897 --> 15:15.614
We've got half the force
looking for you? Hey!

15:15.648 --> 15:18.250
No. Listen. Get a trace on this phone.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.601
Get eyes on me.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.904
I don't know where I am
or who the hell Elena Markov is,

15:21.938 --> 15:24.339
but her story is a lie.

15:24.373 --> 15:27.009
She is more than just
a low-level courier.

15:27.043 --> 15:29.828
You never like it
when we bring new people in,

15:29.879 --> 15:31.163
especially above you.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.915
That's not what it is, not this time.

15:32.949 --> 15:33.916
Okay, she was afraid.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.152
All right, you keep an eye on her,

15:37.186 --> 15:38.370
and if she is wrong,

15:38.404 --> 15:40.639
then you get to do the honors, okay?

15:44.661 --> 15:46.828
Let's go.

15:55.690 --> 15:58.338
Are you telling me that
we can't trace Beckett's call?

15:58.378 --> 16:01.280
It's a voice-over-Internet line
fed through an anonymizer.

16:01.315 --> 16:03.399
Okay, but can we at least narrow it down

16:03.417 --> 16:05.384
to the area where the call was made?

16:05.419 --> 16:07.453
No, it was routed through the Ukraine,

16:07.487 --> 16:08.721
bounced all over Europe.

16:08.755 --> 16:10.039
These guys know security.

16:10.057 --> 16:13.059
Captain, why did Beckett tell us

16:13.093 --> 16:17.079
that Elena Markov
was more than just a courier?

16:17.114 --> 16:19.181
I have no idea.

16:19.216 --> 16:21.217
So, there's nothing about her
that you haven't told us?

16:21.251 --> 16:22.652
Absolutely not.

16:22.686 --> 16:24.971
Every part of her story
checked out, but...

16:25.005 --> 16:26.389
But what?

16:26.423 --> 16:28.524
We didn't have enough time to go deep,

16:28.558 --> 16:30.126
not with things moving this fast.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.912
We didn't even know miss Markov
until yesterday.

16:32.946 --> 16:35.348
Well, maybe you didn't know her at all.

16:35.399 --> 16:36.482
Looks like we can fix that.

16:36.516 --> 16:37.800
The hospital just called.
She's conscious.

16:37.834 --> 16:39.485
Go talk to her.
Get to the bottom of this.

16:39.519 --> 16:42.121
I'll go with you. She knows me.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.876
Hey, you guys have not been
returning my calls.

16:46.910 --> 16:48.343
Where's Beckett?

16:50.113 --> 16:54.967
Mr. Castle, why don't you
come into my office?

17:11.318 --> 17:12.535
- Hurry it up!
- Quickly.

17:13.970 --> 17:17.106
- Over here. - Let's go.
- Come here.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.724
Do we have any idea where she is?

17:19.792 --> 17:22.127
Traffic-cam footage caught a white van

17:22.162 --> 17:24.714
heading away from the Widmark
right when she was abducted.

17:24.748 --> 17:27.817
We think she was in it, and
we're trying to track it down.

17:27.851 --> 17:29.752
There are reasons for hope here.

17:29.786 --> 17:32.071
I'd love to hear them.

17:32.122 --> 17:34.774
First of all,
they didn't make her as a cop.

17:34.808 --> 17:37.793
They think she's Elena Markov,
which buys us time.

17:37.827 --> 17:39.145
She's pretending to be Elena

17:39.179 --> 17:40.946
when she doesn't know who Elena is?

17:40.981 --> 17:42.631
She can't keep that up forever.

17:42.665 --> 17:44.550
Well, hopefully, she won't have to.

17:44.584 --> 17:47.520
Once Elena tells us everything
that she knows about this,

17:47.571 --> 17:49.738
it could lead us to Beckett.

17:49.756 --> 17:52.258
Miss Markov regained
consciousness about an hour ago.

17:52.309 --> 17:54.643
She's stable, so we transferred
her out of ICU.

17:54.678 --> 17:55.895
Has she said anything yet?

17:55.946 --> 17:57.267
Just that she's glad to be alive.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.581
So, she's lucid?

17:58.615 --> 18:00.833
Yes, but she's also
extremely weak from her ordeal,

18:00.867 --> 18:03.052
so, please, I'd ask that you
limit your time with her

18:03.086 --> 18:04.186
as much as possible.

18:04.221 --> 18:06.272
We need answers,
so we're gonna question her

18:06.306 --> 18:07.273
as long as it takes.

18:07.324 --> 18:10.559
Room's just up here... 3410.

18:10.594 --> 18:12.278
I thought you had
an officer guarding her.

18:12.329 --> 18:14.196
We do. He must be inside with her.

18:15.315 --> 18:17.316
Elena Markov, NYP...

18:17.350 --> 18:18.818
son of a bitch.

18:18.869 --> 18:21.103
We have an officer down! Officer down!

18:21.138 --> 18:22.138
Elena's gone.

18:22.172 --> 18:23.572
Either she killed him and fled...

18:23.607 --> 18:25.141
Or someone else did
and they grabbed her.

18:25.175 --> 18:27.827
If they took Elena, that means
Beckett's cover's blown.

18:29.012 --> 18:30.062
She's as good as dead.

18:38.155 --> 18:40.639
<i>Dear Rick,</i>

18:40.674 --> 18:43.425
<i>I don't know how much time I have,</i>

18:43.460 --> 18:45.311
<i>even to write this letter.</i>

18:45.362 --> 18:47.730
<i>What I do know now is that I'm in this,</i>

18:47.764 --> 18:50.116
<i>and the only way</i>
<i>I'm gonna make it out alive</i>

18:50.150 --> 18:51.617
<i>is to see this through.</i>

18:51.651 --> 18:52.902
<i>I'm sure everyone is looking for me,</i>

18:52.936 --> 18:54.453
<i>and if they figure out I was here,</i>

18:54.488 --> 18:56.972
<i>CSU's gonna search this house.</i>

18:57.006 --> 19:00.392
<i>They're gonna look for blood,</i>
<i>and they will find it,</i>

19:00.427 --> 19:03.179
<i>which will lead them to this letter.</i>

19:03.213 --> 19:04.930
<i>Babe, it's your letter,</i>

19:04.981 --> 19:07.032
<i>and I hope you never</i>
<i>have to read this...</i>

19:07.083 --> 19:09.185
<i>that I can tell you</i>
<i>all of these things in person,</i>

19:09.219 --> 19:13.022
<i>but if something happens</i>
<i>and I don't make it,</i>

19:13.056 --> 19:16.058
<i>I need you to know that our partnership,</i>

19:16.092 --> 19:17.960
<i>our relationship</i>

19:17.994 --> 19:22.998
<i>is the greatest thing</i>
<i>that has ever happened to me.</i>

19:23.033 --> 19:24.283
<i>You're an amazing man,</i>

19:24.317 --> 19:27.820
<i>and I love you with all of my heart.</i>

19:27.854 --> 19:29.655
<i>Always.</i>

19:36.062 --> 19:39.815
Mr. Jones wants a word.

19:51.227 --> 19:54.313
Let's go.

20:03.256 --> 20:05.374
I've got surprising news.

20:05.408 --> 20:07.493
Lazarus agreed to meet with you

20:07.527 --> 20:09.511
<i>if</i> you agree to an assignment.

20:09.546 --> 20:13.115
What assignment?

20:13.149 --> 20:15.618
You complete the assignment,
you get the meeting.

20:15.652 --> 20:17.369
Take it or leave it.

20:18.872 --> 20:21.840
Deal. What do I have to do?

20:23.826 --> 20:25.628
What you do best.

20:27.214 --> 20:28.347
Kill him.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.967
Make it clean.

20:37.712 --> 20:39.290
We're here.

20:39.341 --> 20:40.610
Where's here?

20:40.634 --> 20:43.347
All you need to know is that
the target's in that house.

20:43.378 --> 20:44.561
Is he alone?

20:44.596 --> 20:45.948
As far as I know.

20:45.964 --> 20:47.261
Use this.

20:47.285 --> 20:49.570
Lazarus doesn't want it to be
connected to your other kills.

20:51.423 --> 20:53.390
Well, he's got to be important.
Who is he?

20:53.408 --> 20:55.392
He's the next name on the list.

20:55.427 --> 20:58.379
What does he do?

20:58.413 --> 21:01.965
Why are you so curious all of a sudden?

21:03.539 --> 21:05.173
You ever hear of recon?

21:05.207 --> 21:07.208
I like to know what I'm walking into.

21:07.243 --> 21:09.310
Is he a cop, is he a drug dealer,

21:09.345 --> 21:10.945
are there guns in the house?

21:10.980 --> 21:12.497
Curiosity keeps me alive.

21:12.531 --> 21:15.099
The guy's a civilian, a nobody.

21:15.117 --> 21:16.367
If he's a nobody,
then why are we killing him?

21:16.402 --> 21:19.020
Because they told us to.

21:23.269 --> 21:24.909
Look, is there...
is there a problem here?

21:24.927 --> 21:26.844
Yeah, there's a problem.
I don't work like this.

21:26.879 --> 21:29.113
I do my homework,

21:29.148 --> 21:31.566
I control the variables,
and this is sloppy.

21:31.617 --> 21:34.569
You know, maybe Lazarus wanted
to see how well you improvise.

21:34.603 --> 21:37.755
You know, maybe I do, too.

21:37.789 --> 21:42.844
Now... are you gonna kill him or what?

22:33.395 --> 22:35.463
Who in the hell are you?!

22:49.511 --> 22:50.628
It's done.

22:53.816 --> 22:55.049
Show me.

22:55.084 --> 22:56.050
What?

22:56.085 --> 22:58.836
No. We don't have time for this.

22:58.854 --> 23:00.238
I said show me.

23:00.272 --> 23:03.191
Now.

23:15.204 --> 23:17.088
Like I said.

23:23.479 --> 23:26.347
I'm done auditioning.

23:26.382 --> 23:28.549
You tell Lazarus he wants to play games

23:28.600 --> 23:29.734
and this deal's off.

23:35.341 --> 23:37.541
Yeah, we should get back.

23:45.217 --> 23:47.385
Just got off with
the hospital security again.

23:47.403 --> 23:48.736
The building's locked down.

23:48.787 --> 23:51.172
We got teams going through,
but there's no sign of Elena.

23:51.223 --> 23:52.774
And we still have no idea
who this woman really is.

23:52.825 --> 23:53.991
I'm afraid we do.

23:54.026 --> 23:56.160
Security video shows
her leaving her room alone,

23:56.178 --> 23:57.528
and the officer's throat was cut

23:57.563 --> 23:59.663
in the same exact manner
as the murdered drug dealers...

23:59.682 --> 24:02.600
same angle, same left-handed
stroke favoring the carotid.

24:02.618 --> 24:04.502
That's what those
text messages meant

24:04.536 --> 24:06.003
about packages being delivered.

24:06.037 --> 24:07.588
She wasn't a courier for the ring.

24:07.623 --> 24:08.823
She was their contract killer.

24:08.857 --> 24:09.940
A contract killer?!

24:09.958 --> 24:11.993
That's who Beckett
is out there impersonating

24:12.027 --> 24:13.778
- and you didn't know?
- Mr. Castle...

24:13.812 --> 24:15.563
And now this woman
is out there somewhere?

24:15.597 --> 24:17.632
Do you have any idea
what's gonna happen to Beckett

24:17.666 --> 24:18.983
when the real Elena shows up?

24:19.017 --> 24:20.301
We're doing everything we can.

24:20.335 --> 24:21.436
Well, it's not enough.

24:21.470 --> 24:22.737
Hey, come on, man.

24:22.771 --> 24:24.989
This is Gates.

24:25.023 --> 24:27.058
What?

24:27.092 --> 24:29.711
Where?

24:41.557 --> 24:46.577
She told me
to get down on the floor,

24:46.595 --> 24:48.712
and then she said she was a cop

24:48.731 --> 24:50.782
and that if I wanted to live,

24:50.816 --> 24:53.468
I had to do exactly what she said.

24:53.502 --> 24:56.487
And then she went to the kitchen
and she came back with ketchup

24:56.521 --> 24:58.706
and... and... and beet juice and...

24:58.757 --> 25:02.210
and she told me
to lie as still as possible

25:02.244 --> 25:04.028
and to hold my breath.

25:04.062 --> 25:05.563
Mr. Potter,

25:05.597 --> 25:07.648
did she say anything else
about where she was,

25:07.699 --> 25:08.866
<i>where they were keeping her?</i>

25:08.901 --> 25:11.569
Yeah. She said it was
some kind of a compound.

25:11.587 --> 25:12.870
She didn't know where

25:12.904 --> 25:15.673
but that she would try to get
<i>a message out soon.</i>

25:15.707 --> 25:16.858
At least we know she's still alive.

25:16.892 --> 25:20.094
<i>This guy who was with her.</i>

25:20.129 --> 25:21.629
<i>Did you see his face?</i>

25:21.663 --> 25:23.297
No. I had my head down.

25:23.348 --> 25:24.932
Do you have any idea
why members of a drug ring

25:24.967 --> 25:26.317
would want you dead?

25:26.335 --> 25:28.102
No. That's not my world.

25:28.137 --> 25:30.371
You're an attorney
at Tyre, Potter, and Langston.

25:30.405 --> 25:31.973
What kind of law do you practice?

25:32.007 --> 25:34.075
It's mostly corporate...

25:34.109 --> 25:35.626
trust administration.

25:35.661 --> 25:37.761
Do you do any criminal law?

25:37.780 --> 25:38.996
<i>No, none.</i>

25:39.031 --> 25:41.432
I hate this.

25:41.467 --> 25:42.667
She's out there somewhere,

25:42.701 --> 25:44.452
has no idea how much danger she's in,

25:44.503 --> 25:45.503
and I can't help her.

25:45.537 --> 25:48.239
No, you can't.

25:48.273 --> 25:51.993
But this is Beckett we're talking about.

25:52.027 --> 25:54.796
But she's also a damn good cop,
so don't sell her short.

25:54.847 --> 25:58.115
She'll figure out a way
to let us know what's going on,

25:58.150 --> 26:01.803
and when she does, we'll get her out.

26:01.837 --> 26:06.257
What if it's not in time?

26:46.949 --> 26:50.368
So, how did it go?

26:52.237 --> 26:55.406
The package was delivered
without any issues.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.992
Good.

26:58.043 --> 27:00.328
Clean yourself up.

27:00.379 --> 27:02.830
Lazarus wants to see you.

27:27.926 --> 27:32.313
You're getting out of here... alive.

27:33.898 --> 27:36.367
Sorry. I really have to pee.

27:36.401 --> 27:37.885
Do you mind?

27:37.919 --> 27:38.886
No, it's fine.

27:38.937 --> 27:41.589
Thank you.

27:42.791 --> 27:46.894
Great gig, huh?

27:46.928 --> 27:47.828
Yeah, it's amazing.

27:47.862 --> 27:49.163
I don't know who these guys are,

27:49.197 --> 27:50.614
but they sure like to spend money.

27:52.567 --> 27:55.010
Come on. He's waiting.

28:01.684 --> 28:04.019
This way.

28:32.863 --> 28:35.131
You keep him in the basement?

28:35.165 --> 28:36.499
He likes it there.

28:36.533 --> 28:38.985
He thinks it suits him.

28:39.019 --> 28:42.338
After you.

29:01.875 --> 29:02.975
What's the matter?

29:03.010 --> 29:05.294
You've never seen
a counting room before?

29:05.329 --> 29:06.629
Yes.

29:06.663 --> 29:08.865
But never to this scale.

29:08.899 --> 29:11.300
Lazarus is a man of enormous appetites.

29:12.836 --> 29:15.771
I'm impressed you've been able
to hide this from the feds.

29:15.789 --> 29:18.307
You don't know the half of it.

29:41.014 --> 29:42.164
Wait here.

30:04.721 --> 30:07.623
He's ready. Come in.

30:11.695 --> 30:15.281
I apologize for the delay.

30:15.332 --> 30:18.267
I had to resolve a business matter.

30:18.301 --> 30:20.369
Of course.

30:20.403 --> 30:24.090
I don't usually do this...
meet like this.

30:24.124 --> 30:26.125
But for you, I'll make an exception.

30:26.159 --> 30:28.794
Between our needs and your skill set,

30:28.829 --> 30:31.864
this could be
a very profitable arrangement.

30:31.949 --> 30:34.267
I agree.

30:34.301 --> 30:36.068
Good.

30:36.119 --> 30:38.371
So, now that we've met,

30:38.405 --> 30:42.341
why don't we formalize our arrangement?

30:44.561 --> 30:46.846
You are not Elena.

30:49.666 --> 30:51.233
What do you mean?

30:51.268 --> 30:53.235
I know you.

30:53.270 --> 30:55.748
No. No, I don't think you do.

30:55.750 --> 30:59.135
No, no, no. I never forget a face.

30:59.169 --> 31:00.954
Detective Beckett.

31:00.988 --> 31:02.722
Oh, no, no, no.

31:04.858 --> 31:06.459
She is a cop?

31:06.510 --> 31:09.345
Homicide out of the 12th.

31:09.380 --> 31:11.047
Last time I saw you,

31:11.081 --> 31:13.883
you tried to put me through a wall.

31:13.918 --> 31:17.353
Accused me of murdering your mama.

31:17.388 --> 31:21.891
And from the look on her face,
she remembers me.

31:21.909 --> 31:23.927
Don't you, detective?

31:26.063 --> 31:28.615
Vulcan Simmons.

31:28.649 --> 31:31.334
You're Lazarus?

31:46.767 --> 31:49.285
Yo, guys. It's her.

31:49.319 --> 31:50.787
It came in from an unknown number.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.605
But that's her badge number.
It's got to be her.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.990
"Addr is 5."

31:54.024 --> 31:55.008
She was trying to send an address.

31:55.042 --> 31:55.992
Looks like she got cut off.

31:56.026 --> 31:57.060
Run that phone number.

31:57.127 --> 31:59.178
Find out who owns it
and find out where it is.

31:59.213 --> 32:00.263
Right.

32:14.712 --> 32:18.114
Let's do it without all this
Kabuki theater, detective.

32:18.148 --> 32:20.717
It's undignified.

32:20.751 --> 32:23.186
Tell me what I want to know,

32:23.220 --> 32:25.088
and I'll give you a proper death

32:25.122 --> 32:27.523
without all this messy suffering.

32:35.549 --> 32:36.849
Now...

32:39.486 --> 32:41.387
...what was your mission

32:41.422 --> 32:44.440
and what do they know about Lazarus?

32:44.458 --> 32:48.577
Do you want undignified?

32:48.595 --> 32:51.447
Then wait till you see what I do to you.

32:51.498 --> 32:55.184
You know, you're just like your mom...

32:55.202 --> 32:57.920
both playing in worlds
where you don't belong.

33:02.459 --> 33:04.427
Your mother paid for it with her life.

33:04.461 --> 33:06.579
So will you.

33:06.630 --> 33:08.981
But first...

33:14.671 --> 33:19.275
...tell me what I want to know.

33:26.366 --> 33:27.850
Yo. Just got off with the carrier.

33:27.885 --> 33:29.218
Any idea whose phone it is?

33:29.252 --> 33:30.670
It's a pre-paid. There's no way
to identify the owner.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.354
I got a hit.

33:32.372 --> 33:35.891
The signal originated
from a tower in Scarsdale.

33:35.909 --> 33:37.243
Great. Can you lock on the location?

33:37.277 --> 33:39.562
No. The message pinged off
a single tower.

33:39.596 --> 33:40.836
Without a second or third tower,

33:40.864 --> 33:42.732
there's no way to narrow it down.

33:42.766 --> 33:43.926
Depending on signal strength,

33:43.951 --> 33:45.418
it could have originated anywhere

33:45.452 --> 33:46.769
within this 10-mile radius.

33:46.804 --> 33:48.604
It would be easier to find
a needle in a haystack.

33:48.622 --> 33:49.922
Can you ping the GPS?

33:49.957 --> 33:52.625
It's off, and it looks like
the phone's off, as well.

33:52.659 --> 33:54.761
I'm sorry. I've got no other way
to trace it.

33:54.812 --> 33:56.812
That's the best I can do.

34:07.624 --> 34:10.326
I know your lungs are burning.

34:10.360 --> 34:15.081
I can feel the panic in your soul.

34:15.114 --> 34:18.034
All you want is for this to end.

34:18.068 --> 34:21.036
And I promise I will end it.

34:21.071 --> 34:24.123
Just tell me what I want to know.

34:38.972 --> 34:40.940
Scrub the place.

34:43.310 --> 34:46.594
Find a patch of dirt to put her in...

34:46.612 --> 34:49.598
somewhere where she won't be found.

34:52.646 --> 34:54.730
I love these woods.

34:54.764 --> 34:58.901
My daddy used to take me hunting
up here when I was a kid.

34:58.936 --> 35:02.288
I spent days
learning every rock, every tree,

35:02.306 --> 35:05.141
all the secret little places to hide.

35:05.175 --> 35:07.860
Over the years, it's come in handy.

35:20.607 --> 35:21.641
You know, I had you made

35:21.675 --> 35:22.942
from the moment
you walked through the door.

35:22.976 --> 35:24.677
I could see it in your eyes.

35:24.711 --> 35:26.779
I thought, "no way
this woman's a killer."

35:26.797 --> 35:28.664
No.

35:28.699 --> 35:30.917
You don't want to kill me, Harden.

35:30.951 --> 35:32.401
You know that I'm a cop.

35:32.436 --> 35:33.636
Yeah, I've killed cops before.

35:33.637 --> 35:35.872
In fact, a few of them
are your new neighbors.

35:35.906 --> 35:37.874
My people will hunt you down.
They will kill you.

35:37.908 --> 35:39.959
But we can make a deal.

35:39.993 --> 35:43.713
You help me take down Lazarus,
you can set any deal you want.

35:43.747 --> 35:46.365
No, I'm good with the deal I got.

35:46.383 --> 35:47.733
Thank you.

36:02.216 --> 36:05.001
Elena.

36:05.035 --> 36:07.186
You got balls. I'll give you that.

36:13.393 --> 36:14.994
You're not gonna kill me?

36:15.028 --> 36:18.080
He sent me because he owed you.

36:18.115 --> 36:19.999
He said he wanted you to live.

36:20.033 --> 36:22.518
Who sent you?

36:22.552 --> 36:24.887
Who wanted me to live?

36:24.922 --> 36:27.540
Lazarus.

36:36.583 --> 36:39.118
Tactical teams
raided the compound

36:39.136 --> 36:41.854
at 0600 this morning,
shortly after your call.

36:41.888 --> 36:44.240
The place was empty. Everything's gone.

36:44.274 --> 36:46.959
The mansion itself
is held in a trust

36:46.994 --> 36:48.527
by an offshore corporation.

36:48.595 --> 36:50.915
It'll be months before we find
out who the real owners are.

36:50.930 --> 36:52.615
If ever.

36:52.649 --> 36:54.400
And what about Vulcan Simmons?

36:54.434 --> 36:57.386
My team picked him up this
morning in Washington Heights...

36:57.421 --> 36:58.771
nowhere near the compound.

36:58.805 --> 37:01.590
They've been questioning
him all morning, but...

37:01.625 --> 37:03.526
He had an alibi for last night.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.978
We'll go after him,
but without evidence,

37:06.013 --> 37:09.148
it will difficult to make
any of your allegations stick.

37:09.166 --> 37:12.234
Are you saying we have nothing?

37:14.204 --> 37:15.788
No, not nothing.

37:24.214 --> 37:26.232
Future Forward?

37:26.266 --> 37:28.768
Yeah, part of the
money-laundering operation...

37:28.802 --> 37:29.935
whatever it was,

37:29.970 --> 37:32.505
they are funneling a lot of cash
into that account.

37:40.947 --> 37:42.715
See what happens when I leave you alone?

37:42.733 --> 37:44.650
Babe, I wasn't alone.

37:44.668 --> 37:46.886
When they were interrogating me,

37:46.920 --> 37:51.023
the only thing that kept me
going was thinking about you,

37:51.091 --> 37:54.043
about our future, the wedding.

37:54.077 --> 37:57.847
You were with me the whole time.

38:01.685 --> 38:05.204
Well, at least it's not a total loss.

38:05.238 --> 38:07.606
Now that the police know
that Vulcan Simmons is Lazarus,

38:07.640 --> 38:08.741
they'll be watching him.

38:08.775 --> 38:10.676
He will not be able
to rebuild his operation.

38:10.710 --> 38:13.195
He's not Lazarus.

38:13.246 --> 38:15.815
If he was, then I would be dead.

38:15.849 --> 38:18.667
Vulcan Simmons is just a figurehead.

38:18.702 --> 38:21.053
Someone else is behind this,
someone higher up,

38:21.088 --> 38:23.923
someone who wanted me alive.

38:23.957 --> 38:25.691
Who?

38:27.494 --> 38:29.595
Someone bigger.

38:29.629 --> 38:30.796
This can't be right.

38:30.814 --> 38:32.231
I'm afraid it is, sir.

38:32.265 --> 38:34.385
You're saying that's
what Future Forward is...

38:34.418 --> 38:35.468
a political super pac?

38:35.502 --> 38:37.203
That's where the money was going?

38:37.237 --> 38:39.205
Yeah, and that's a connection
to Evan Potter,

38:39.239 --> 38:40.439
our would-be victim.

38:40.474 --> 38:42.308
Potter did all the legal work
to establish the super pac

38:42.342 --> 38:44.610
for a client of his...
a wealthy hedge-fund manager

38:44.644 --> 38:47.179
with significant political
connections named Jason Kochler.

38:47.214 --> 38:49.681
It would appear as if drug money
were being funneled

38:49.699 --> 38:51.350
into Future Forward's accounts.

38:51.385 --> 38:54.003
Nearly $160 million
in the past several months.

38:54.037 --> 38:55.104
It was then legally laundered,

38:55.138 --> 38:56.472
passing through an anonymous shell corp

38:56.506 --> 38:57.587
and second secret super pac.

38:57.607 --> 38:59.258
What do you mean "legally laundered"?

38:59.292 --> 39:01.127
- Where's that money now?
- It's gone.

39:01.161 --> 39:02.282
Federal tax and banking laws

39:02.295 --> 39:03.815
that regulate these kind of super pacs

39:03.847 --> 39:05.431
make it impossible for us to find out

39:05.465 --> 39:07.233
where that money
actually came from or went.

39:07.267 --> 39:08.834
Well, someone must be able to tell us.

39:08.869 --> 39:09.819
Evan Potter.

39:09.853 --> 39:11.170
No. He just set up the pac for Kochler.

39:11.204 --> 39:12.438
He didn't run it.

39:12.472 --> 39:14.490
Then we need to bring
Jason Kochler in here.

39:14.524 --> 39:15.574
We can't.

39:15.592 --> 39:17.643
He died of a heart attack this morning.

39:17.677 --> 39:19.779
That's why you couldn't find the money.

39:19.813 --> 39:23.199
Someone's using it to build
a massive political war chest.

39:23.233 --> 39:24.533
But who?

39:24.584 --> 39:26.102
It's impossible to know.

39:26.136 --> 39:28.654
<i>Those of you who know me</i>

39:28.688 --> 39:31.023
<i>know that I've gotten where I am today</i>

39:31.057 --> 39:33.826
<i>by doing whatever it takes</i>
<i>to get the job done.</i>

39:33.860 --> 39:36.729
<i>That is the kind of leadership</i>
<i>this country needs,</i>

39:36.763 --> 39:39.732
<i>and that is why I am forming</i>
<i>an exploratory committee</i>

39:39.766 --> 39:42.668
<i>for a run for the presidency</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

39:45.205 --> 39:47.473
<i>Senator Bracken,</i>
<i>an early front runner,</i>

39:47.507 --> 39:50.042
<i>is rumored to have significant funding</i>

39:50.076 --> 39:52.812
<i>already lined up</i>
<i>from major contributors.</i>

39:52.846 --> 39:55.714
Hiding behind Vulcan Simmons,

39:55.749 --> 39:57.566
funding his campaign with dirty money,

39:57.601 --> 39:59.201
killing whoever gets in his way,

39:59.236 --> 40:00.719
just like he did with my mom.

40:00.754 --> 40:03.689
It's him.

40:03.707 --> 40:08.194
And we have no way of proving it.

40:08.228 --> 40:11.430
Maybe the feds will find something.

40:11.464 --> 40:14.066
No. Bracken is so well-insulated.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.801
It's genius, actually.

40:15.836 --> 40:18.420
He has all the campaign funds
that he needs

40:18.455 --> 40:20.372
without having to compromise
or be beholden

40:20.406 --> 40:21.857
to any special-interest groups.

40:21.892 --> 40:23.692
But if it really was him,

40:23.727 --> 40:27.112
why wouldn't he just let you die
in the woods?

40:27.147 --> 40:28.647
Why would he send Elena to save you?

40:28.681 --> 40:32.701
Because when I stopped
the assassination last year,

40:32.736 --> 40:33.869
I saved him.

40:33.904 --> 40:37.156
And he told me that he owed me.

40:37.190 --> 40:40.292
And now we're even.

40:40.327 --> 40:44.213
So the next time
that we see each other...

40:55.425 --> 40:57.059
Come to bed.
