WEBVTT

00:00.254 --> 00:03.023
What's up, Marlatans?
Welcome to "The Marlon Way."

00:03.024 --> 00:04.376
You know, a man's place

00:04.377 --> 00:06.145
should reflect who the man is.

00:06.146 --> 00:07.794
When you look around here, you say,

00:07.794 --> 00:10.529
"Damn, that man is divorced as hell."

00:10.530 --> 00:12.298
In my kitchen, I don't even know

00:12.299 --> 00:13.966
where the damn pots are,

00:13.967 --> 00:16.201
but I know where
that Foreman grill is, though!

00:16.202 --> 00:18.836
Then there's my miscellaneous drawer

00:18.837 --> 00:20.338
full with mystery things,

00:20.339 --> 00:23.308
like mystery keys,

00:23.309 --> 00:25.176
mystery sauce packets,

00:25.177 --> 00:27.111
and, oh, look!

00:27.112 --> 00:29.447
Mystery panties.

00:29.448 --> 00:30.615
Ain't mine.

00:32.518 --> 00:34.252
And in my living room,

00:34.253 --> 00:35.687
there's a nasty old couch

00:35.688 --> 00:37.855
with a nasty old man that lives on it.

00:40.926 --> 00:42.560
As cool as this place is,

00:42.561 --> 00:44.529
it just ain't me anymore.

00:44.530 --> 00:46.531
It's time to make some changes
up in here.

00:46.532 --> 00:48.766
But I'm keeping
that Foreman grill, though!

00:48.767 --> 00:51.035
Now who wants some dry-ass sliders?

00:51.036 --> 00:52.804
I do!

00:57.421 --> 01:03.141
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

01:04.983 --> 01:06.584
Tomorrow morning?

01:06.585 --> 01:08.019
Perfect.

01:08.020 --> 01:09.554
Thank God for plumbers.

01:09.555 --> 01:11.222
I thought you said Marlon fixed

01:11.223 --> 01:12.724
that sink upstairs.

01:12.725 --> 01:13.992
He fixed it, all right.

01:13.993 --> 01:16.394
That's why I had to call the plumber.

01:16.395 --> 01:19.030
And since Marlon is going away
to Vegas this weekend,

01:19.031 --> 01:21.032
he'll never know I fixed his fix.

01:21.033 --> 01:23.468
Well, ignorance is bliss,

01:23.469 --> 01:24.902
which is why Marlon's always got

01:24.903 --> 01:31.743
that stupid grin on his face.

01:31.744 --> 01:33.611
Hi, Ashley.

01:33.612 --> 01:36.581
Hi, Trashley.

01:36.582 --> 01:38.283
I thought you were going to Vegas.

01:38.284 --> 01:39.951
I was, but I wanted to stop by

01:39.952 --> 01:42.253
and say a few things. Number one,

01:42.254 --> 01:44.389
I wanted to get "Trashley"
off my plate.

01:44.390 --> 01:47.625
Been sitting on that one
for quite some time.

01:47.626 --> 01:49.627
And number two, I got big news.

01:49.628 --> 01:51.529
We're buying our house!

01:51.530 --> 01:52.797
We?

01:52.798 --> 01:57.769
Negro, you can't even afford
a birdhouse.

01:57.770 --> 02:00.338
The owner of the house
I'm renting is selling it,

02:00.339 --> 02:01.572
and I got first dibs.

02:01.573 --> 02:03.007
Oh, really?

02:03.008 --> 02:04.642
But you always said that neighborhood

02:04.643 --> 02:07.111
was full of stuck-up,
recycling douchebags.

02:07.112 --> 02:10.580
Yeah, I did say that,
but the asexual, sad-sack nerd

02:10.582 --> 02:11.616
who does my taxes

02:11.617 --> 02:13.885
said I need a big deduction.

02:13.886 --> 02:16.587
I believe the term I used
was "write-off."

02:18.791 --> 02:22.093
Now all we need is the approval
of the homeowners' association,

02:22.094 --> 02:23.461
so we're throwing a little shindig

02:23.462 --> 02:25.063
on Monday night
so Marlon can win them over.

02:25.064 --> 02:27.298
Yes, and the lady
who runs the committee

02:27.299 --> 02:29.200
is married, so I gotta be careful.

02:29.201 --> 02:30.201
You know, there's a fine line

02:30.202 --> 02:31.502
between charming Marlon

02:31.503 --> 02:33.538
and smash-able Marlon.

02:33.539 --> 02:36.374
I want to be a homeowner,
not a homewrecker.

02:38.210 --> 02:40.511
Okay, Daddy, will you please tell Zack

02:40.512 --> 02:42.714
the odds of winning in Vegas
are staggeringly low?

02:42.715 --> 02:43.781
She don't know that.

02:43.782 --> 02:44.782
Okay, listen.

02:44.783 --> 02:46.417
Put this dollar on black.

02:46.418 --> 02:47.685
No, red.

02:47.686 --> 02:49.053
No, black.

02:49.054 --> 02:50.888
- No, red.
- Irregardless

02:50.889 --> 02:52.323
of where he puts it,

02:52.324 --> 02:54.625
your bad-luck daddy's
going to lose that cash.

02:55.928 --> 02:57.161
"Bad-luck daddy" sounds like

02:57.162 --> 02:58.696
your father's autobiography.

03:01.233 --> 03:04.335
Sorry. It was good.

03:04.336 --> 03:05.970
You know what, Marlon? I'm excited

03:05.971 --> 03:07.305
about you buying that house.

03:07.306 --> 03:08.906
I've always liked the bones of it.

03:08.907 --> 03:10.475
Yeah, and you know, I always loved

03:10.476 --> 03:11.976
the bones of this house.

03:11.977 --> 03:13.578
Remember that one we did
right there on the counter?

03:13.579 --> 03:15.346
Oh-ho-ho!

03:15.347 --> 03:17.415
Right there! Ha, ha, ha!

03:17.416 --> 03:19.517
I'm just hoping
for a more comfortable couch

03:19.518 --> 03:22.587
once Marlon redecorates.

03:22.588 --> 03:24.288
You're redecorating?

03:24.289 --> 03:26.657
No, I'm just moving
some things around.

03:26.658 --> 03:27.925
Nothing big.

03:27.926 --> 03:30.094
Well, why didn't you ask for my help?

03:30.095 --> 03:31.195
This is my lane.

03:31.730 --> 03:33.197
Plus, we decorated
this house together,

03:33.198 --> 03:34.399
so I know your style.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.967
Yeah, but you know,

03:35.968 --> 03:39.070
you... you're busy.
You know, with the kids...

03:39.071 --> 03:41.072
She's a professional designer, Marlon.

03:41.073 --> 03:42.573
You'd be a fool to say no.

03:42.574 --> 03:44.876
And I'd be happy to help. In fact,

03:44.877 --> 03:46.077
I insist.

03:46.078 --> 03:47.945
Marlon, she insists.

03:47.946 --> 03:49.781
I believe the phrase
you're looking for is

03:49.782 --> 03:51.983
"Thank you, Ashley.

03:51.984 --> 03:54.452
"That's what I wanted you to say.

03:54.453 --> 03:58.289
Mm, girl, I'm so thankful."

03:58.290 --> 03:59.590
Oh, my God! I'm so excited.

03:59.591 --> 04:01.292
- Yeah...
- All right, so while you guys

04:01.293 --> 04:03.027
are in Vegas,
Yvette and I'll swing by,

04:03.028 --> 04:05.363
take some measurements,
and when you get back,

04:05.364 --> 04:06.931
we can discuss the mood board

04:06.932 --> 04:08.800
that is percolating in my mind.

04:08.801 --> 04:10.301
Oh!

04:10.302 --> 04:12.170
Yeah, this is great.

04:12.171 --> 04:15.206
Ah, Ashley's going to decorate
my house.

04:16.608 --> 04:18.176
This is terrible.

04:18.177 --> 04:20.077
Ashley's going to decorate my house.

04:20.077 --> 04:21.446
Why are you so upset?

04:21.447 --> 04:22.447
Stevie,

04:22.448 --> 04:24.081
Ashley don't know what I like.

04:24.082 --> 04:26.617
We were married.

04:26.618 --> 04:28.786
And let me tell you something:
When "we" decorated

04:28.787 --> 04:30.421
"our house," hmph.

04:30.422 --> 04:32.190
I just "mm-hm" and "yeah, baby"

04:32.191 --> 04:35.660
my way through the entire thing.

04:35.661 --> 04:37.128
Now I'll be stuck with bed skirts

04:37.129 --> 04:39.697
and itchy throws and pillow shams.

04:39.698 --> 04:42.266
I am not mad at a nice sham.

04:42.267 --> 04:43.734
Stevie,

04:43.735 --> 04:46.871
I want my house
to reflect who I am now.

04:46.872 --> 04:48.673
You know, I want it to reflect
single Marlon.

04:48.674 --> 04:49.674
You know?

04:49.675 --> 04:51.609
Grown and sexy Marlon.

04:51.610 --> 04:53.978
Threesome Marlon.

04:53.979 --> 04:55.746
Ain't no girls gonna walk in my house

04:55.747 --> 04:56.981
and be excited by pillow shams.

04:56.982 --> 04:59.250
Like, "Oh, my God! Lisa!

04:59.251 --> 05:01.118
"Girl, he got shams!

05:01.119 --> 05:04.388
"Get ready to take your panties off!

05:04.389 --> 05:06.157
"Oh, hold on, girl!

05:06.158 --> 05:07.825
"Are those coasters?

05:07.826 --> 05:09.193
"Ooh, you mean to tell me,

05:09.194 --> 05:10.461
"you don't leave circles

05:10.462 --> 05:12.463
"on good wood and countertops?

05:12.464 --> 05:15.399
"Oh, he about to get it today!

05:15.400 --> 05:18.402
Being my first..."

05:18.403 --> 05:19.837
Well, okay, if you didn't like

05:19.838 --> 05:21.639
Ashley's style,
why don't you just tell her?

05:21.640 --> 05:23.441
Because, Stevie, when you're married,

05:23.442 --> 05:24.775
you gotta keep the peace

05:24.776 --> 05:26.143
at all costs.

05:26.144 --> 05:27.678
You know, you could keep it real,

05:27.679 --> 05:29.680
but you can't keep it
really, really real.

05:29.681 --> 05:32.049
You know, it's just
the politics of marriage.

05:32.050 --> 05:33.885
But Marlon,

05:33.886 --> 05:35.519
you're divorced.

05:38.524 --> 05:40.291
Wow, Stevie.

05:40.292 --> 05:41.726
You're right.

05:41.727 --> 05:44.729
Me and Ashley are just friends,
like me and you,

05:44.730 --> 05:46.531
and I always keep it real with you.

05:46.532 --> 05:48.566
A little too real.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.701
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't keep it so real

05:50.702 --> 05:52.069
about my insecurities.

05:52.070 --> 05:53.037
Come on, no.

05:53.038 --> 05:56.440
You love it, Mommy Hips.

05:56.441 --> 05:58.175
You got them hips
that back in the day,

05:58.176 --> 06:01.712
they'd go, "That's a good woman!

06:01.713 --> 06:03.447
She got them birthing hips!"

06:04.516 --> 06:05.750
You know what?

06:05.751 --> 06:06.884
I'ma talk to Ashley,

06:06.885 --> 06:08.419
I'ma be like, "You know what?

06:08.420 --> 06:11.122
I don't need your help
redecorating my house."

06:11.123 --> 06:13.424
That's exactly what I'ma do,

06:13.425 --> 06:15.226
as soon as we get back.

06:18.497 --> 06:19.830
â™ª Hella

06:21.767 --> 06:25.770
Maybe you should've
texted her from the car.

06:28.015 --> 06:32.809
What in the Summer's Eve
commercial is this?

06:32.810 --> 06:34.469
Oh, no!

06:34.470 --> 06:37.525
You guys ruined the surprise!

06:37.526 --> 06:39.816
Why are you back from Vegas so soon?

06:39.817 --> 06:43.470
Ashley, it looks like
your vision board just...

06:43.471 --> 06:45.727
percolated over my house.

06:45.728 --> 06:46.828
Yeah, sorry.

06:47.421 --> 06:48.616
I-I know I jumped the gun
a little bit,

06:48.617 --> 06:50.774
but I figured since your HOA party

06:50.775 --> 06:52.999
is tomorrow, we should
get it done before then.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.457
Hey, Stevie, look.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.051
Shams!

06:57.052 --> 07:00.272
Remember, no more politics.

07:00.273 --> 07:01.834
You are gonna love what we did

07:01.835 --> 07:03.161
with the second bedroom.

07:03.162 --> 07:05.885
Wait, there's a second bedroom?

07:05.886 --> 07:08.508
Now, b-b-b-but ladies, wai-ha-ha-ha.

07:08.509 --> 07:10.501
Uh, before we continue with the tour,

07:10.502 --> 07:13.490
um, I want to thank you for
your hard work,

07:13.491 --> 07:15.549
and tell you how much I appreciate it.

07:15.550 --> 07:17.375
However, um,

07:17.376 --> 07:19.402
there's just a few little things

07:19.403 --> 07:21.659
that... that really don't jive

07:21.660 --> 07:23.320
with my persona, per se.

07:23.321 --> 07:25.146
Oh, okay.

07:25.147 --> 07:26.475
Like which ones?

07:26.476 --> 07:28.567
Mm, just like...

07:28.568 --> 07:35.707
Alllllll...

07:37.000 --> 07:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:14.995 --> 08:21.835
Alllll....

08:21.836 --> 08:23.496
All this.

08:25.523 --> 08:27.680
But Marlon, that's everything.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.142
Yeah, that's...

08:29.143 --> 08:31.333
that's the word I was looking for.

08:31.334 --> 08:32.727
Everything.

08:32.729 --> 08:37.975
But it's hard to say
"everythiiiing..."

08:38.938 --> 08:41.163
I see.

08:41.164 --> 08:43.322
Ashley, but wait... I-I do like this.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.351
This is nice. Look.

08:44.352 --> 08:45.813
It reminds me of you.

08:45.814 --> 08:47.929
It looks like you on a roller coaster

08:47.930 --> 08:49.723
when it goes upside-down.

08:49.724 --> 08:51.052
And this is when you get off,

08:51.053 --> 08:52.380
and your hair's all messed up,

08:52.381 --> 08:54.272
and this is after you get it relaxed,

08:54.273 --> 08:55.373
and it's like, hey.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.790
Marlon, that's the one thing
I kept that was yours.

08:59.853 --> 09:01.579
It's not that it's all bad.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.539
It's... it's just not for me.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.763
You know? It's too well-put-together.

09:05.764 --> 09:07.955
It looks like the set
of a white sitcom,

09:07.956 --> 09:10.213
like you walk in,
and corny theme songs

09:10.214 --> 09:11.376
start playing.

09:11.377 --> 09:13.567
â™ª What do we do, baby

09:13.568 --> 09:16.058
â™ª Without us

09:16.059 --> 09:18.715
â™ª Sha-la-la-la

09:23.366 --> 09:26.254
Marlon, it's fine.

09:26.255 --> 09:28.014
I'm good. It's good.

09:28.015 --> 09:29.176
I'm fine.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.704
Ooh, Ashley. Ashley!

09:30.705 --> 09:32.332
Ashley!

09:33.660 --> 09:36.217
Oh, and it's not fine.

09:36.218 --> 09:39.969
Or good, "brah."

09:39.970 --> 09:41.398
Hey.

09:42.062 --> 09:45.018
Your "brah" stank.

09:46.446 --> 09:48.172
This is messed up, Stevie.

09:48.173 --> 09:49.567
Very messed up.

09:49.568 --> 09:51.825
I've been sleeping
on a couch for three years

09:51.826 --> 09:54.847
when you have a second bedroom!

09:58.335 --> 10:00.027
Hello, Ashley.

10:00.028 --> 10:03.482
Becky with the bad breath.

10:03.483 --> 10:05.242
Can I talk to you, please?

10:08.464 --> 10:10.057
I hope she cusses him out

10:10.058 --> 10:12.548
with his inconsiderate ass.

10:12.549 --> 10:13.975
He's merely trying to engage

10:13.976 --> 10:15.803
in an honest discourse
with his ex-wife.

10:15.804 --> 10:17.595
Well, irregardless,

10:17.596 --> 10:20.119
he's still an ass.

10:21.216 --> 10:23.873
Did you say "irregardless"?

10:23.874 --> 10:26.363
Did I stutter?

10:26.364 --> 10:31.245
Ir-re-gardless.

10:31.246 --> 10:32.673
Listen,

10:32.674 --> 10:33.774
I'm sorry.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.399
I just figured that now
that we're divorced,

10:36.400 --> 10:38.270
that I could express my true feelings

10:38.271 --> 10:40.096
in a way that I couldn't
when we were married.

10:40.097 --> 10:43.716
Oh, so you lied when we were married?

10:43.717 --> 10:46.041
Come on, Ashley.
You never held back anything

10:46.042 --> 10:47.668
for the sake of our relationship?

10:47.669 --> 10:49.262
I didn't.

10:49.263 --> 10:52.749
You never held back anything?

10:52.750 --> 10:54.111
Of course not.

10:54.112 --> 10:58.660
You never held back anything?

10:58.661 --> 11:00.088
You dress like a middle-aged cop

11:00.089 --> 11:01.550
going undercover at a high school.

11:01.551 --> 11:04.007
Ah.

11:04.008 --> 11:06.764
Looking like "42 Jump Street"
up in here.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.981
I like that. That was good, girl.

11:10.982 --> 11:12.476
You've been holding
that one in the chamber

11:12.477 --> 11:14.268
for a while, right?

11:14.269 --> 11:15.664
Okay, okay, yeah.

11:15.665 --> 11:18.188
I'll admit it.
That did feel kind of good.

11:18.189 --> 11:19.848
Yeah, see, I told you it would.

11:19.849 --> 11:21.508
See, now that we're divorced,

11:21.509 --> 11:23.634
we just gotta keep it real. You know?

11:23.635 --> 11:24.963
Do what the kids say.

11:24.964 --> 11:27.353
We keep it one-hun'e.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.213
Are you serious?

11:29.214 --> 11:31.339
Ashley,

11:31.340 --> 11:33.664
we're divorced, right?

11:33.665 --> 11:35.689
We don't have time
to be playing no games.

11:35.690 --> 11:37.416
Are you sure
you can handle this, Marlon?

11:37.417 --> 11:39.441
And you know this.

11:39.442 --> 11:40.704
Fine.

11:41.734 --> 11:43.161
A plumber was here this weekend

11:43.162 --> 11:45.619
to fix the sink upstairs.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.514
Good, 'cause I fell asleep

11:47.515 --> 11:49.936
under the sink. I ain't even touch it.

11:53.809 --> 11:55.639
One old-fashioned for Roberto.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.257
- Thank you, sir.
- And a mai tai

11:57.258 --> 11:59.142
- for his lovely wife, Diane.
- Oh, thank you.

11:59.143 --> 12:02.633
You better be careful.
She "mai tai" you up later.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.757
Oh!

12:04.758 --> 12:05.827
Oh.

12:05.828 --> 12:07.480
It is so nice to finally
meet you, Marlon.

12:07.481 --> 12:08.875
Well, likewise,

12:08.876 --> 12:11.397
and I want you and the entire HOA

12:11.398 --> 12:13.523
to know how much I enjoy being a part

12:13.524 --> 12:15.383
of this darling community.

12:15.384 --> 12:19.235
Oh, well, I love
what you have done in here.

12:19.236 --> 12:20.696
Who is your designer?

12:20.697 --> 12:23.286
Oh, well, that would be me.

12:23.287 --> 12:24.947
- Ooh.
- And Yvette.

12:24.948 --> 12:27.571
Hello. And I'm glad someone loves it,

12:27.572 --> 12:29.298
because Marlon sure doesn't.

12:29.299 --> 12:31.423
Oh. I am sorry I brought it up.

12:31.424 --> 12:34.212
Oh, it's okay.
He already told me he hates it.

12:34.213 --> 12:37.234
Yeah, Ash and I...
we have a very honest divorce.

12:37.235 --> 12:38.364
You know?

12:38.365 --> 12:40.722
We just keep it one-hun'e, right?

12:40.723 --> 12:42.814
See, y'all married people,
y'all gotta abide

12:42.815 --> 12:44.948
by the politics of marriage.

12:44.949 --> 12:46.650
We don't have to do that
anymore, right?

12:46.651 --> 12:47.884
Nope.

12:47.885 --> 12:49.986
Because I kicked his ass to the curb!

12:52.622 --> 12:54.855
She sure did.

12:54.856 --> 12:56.624
She had my bags packed so fast,

12:56.625 --> 12:58.425
I had to give her a tip, right?

13:00.528 --> 13:03.162
Okay, keeping it 100. Interesting.

13:03.163 --> 13:04.830
Yeah, it's hun'e.

13:04.831 --> 13:07.665
Hun'e. We should try that.

13:07.666 --> 13:09.266
Yeah. Sounds like something I'd hear

13:09.267 --> 13:10.734
on your YouTube channel, Marlon.

13:10.735 --> 13:12.235
I'm a huge fan, by the way.

13:12.236 --> 13:14.537
Rrrroberto!

13:14.538 --> 13:16.871
TÃº este mi amigo.

13:16.872 --> 13:19.207
You just became my favorite neighbor.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.375
You know what? Roberto,

13:21.376 --> 13:24.444
you have just earned yourself
hot tub privileges.

13:25.546 --> 13:26.813
That's right.

13:26.814 --> 13:27.846
And Carl,

13:27.847 --> 13:29.114
I'm revoking yours,

13:29.115 --> 13:30.548
'cause you left a ring in my tub!

13:31.917 --> 13:34.551
There's a hot tub in here?

13:34.552 --> 13:37.387
Ashley, he must crack you up
all the time.

13:37.388 --> 13:39.021
What's your favorite
"Marlon Way" video?

13:39.022 --> 13:40.989
Oh, that's easy. Th-this is easy.

13:40.990 --> 13:43.624
I know... help you.
Her favorite one is called

13:43.625 --> 13:44.858
"How to Tell Black People

13:44.859 --> 13:46.693
to be Quiet in the Movie Theater."

13:46.694 --> 13:48.195
It's a real quick video.

13:48.196 --> 13:49.695
It's just cameras on me, and I go,

13:49.696 --> 13:50.830
"You don't!"

13:54.133 --> 13:56.100
Well, that must be a new one,

13:56.101 --> 13:57.868
because I stopped watching your videos

13:57.869 --> 13:59.169
like, three years ago.

13:59.170 --> 14:00.737
I just scrub through till the end

14:00.738 --> 14:02.338
so you get credit for the view.

14:02.339 --> 14:04.339
I call it "The Ashley Way

14:04.340 --> 14:06.007
of Watching 'The Marlon Way.'"

14:09.611 --> 14:13.213
I'm just keeping it 100.

14:13.214 --> 14:14.680
Yeah, and so was I

14:14.681 --> 14:16.348
when I said you turned my house

14:16.349 --> 14:18.149
into the set of "The Golden Girls."

14:19.785 --> 14:23.353
Yeah, â™ª Thank you for being a friend â™ª

14:23.354 --> 14:24.687
Oh, well, you know,

14:24.688 --> 14:27.623
I didn't realize
when I decorated your house

14:27.624 --> 14:29.491
that you wanted the "midlife crisis,

14:29.492 --> 14:32.926
clinging to my youth,
free on Craigslist" look.

14:32.927 --> 14:34.561
Damn!

14:34.562 --> 14:37.830
My girl is keeping it two hun'e!

14:37.831 --> 14:40.799
Yeah.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.100
Which is about 190 more

14:43.101 --> 14:44.935
than you paid for that cheesy dress.

14:47.071 --> 14:48.838
Well, irregardless,

14:48.839 --> 14:50.539
you're the one who started this,

14:50.540 --> 14:52.941
and now, you can't handle it.

14:52.942 --> 14:54.876
She's right, Marlon.

14:54.877 --> 14:56.910
Thin skin never wins.

14:58.379 --> 14:59.946
Aha. Okay.

14:59.947 --> 15:01.680
Oh, okay. Oh!

15:01.681 --> 15:03.082
This is what we do, huh?

15:03.083 --> 15:05.750
Oh, it's Gang Up On Marlon Day?

15:05.751 --> 15:07.252
All right, let's do this.

15:07.253 --> 15:09.052
Marlon, we're just saying, you know?

15:09.053 --> 15:11.721
No, no, no. You grin, you're in.

15:11.722 --> 15:13.189
Let's do this.

15:13.190 --> 15:14.323
Oh, Stevie!

15:14.324 --> 15:15.857
Since we being one hun'e,

15:15.858 --> 15:17.793
how about you tell Yvette

15:17.794 --> 15:20.761
how much you hate
the way her wretched mouth

15:20.762 --> 15:22.796
messes up the Queen's English

15:22.797 --> 15:26.732
with words like, mm, "irregardless."

15:26.733 --> 15:29.133
What's wrong with "irregardless?"

15:29.134 --> 15:31.469
Nothing. It's cute.

15:31.470 --> 15:33.336
It's just not a word!

15:33.337 --> 15:36.006
Yes, and neither is

15:36.007 --> 15:37.673
"pecifically,"

15:37.674 --> 15:38.808
"brecfix,"

15:38.809 --> 15:41.176
"supposabably."

15:41.177 --> 15:43.444
"aksed," or "aks."

15:44.946 --> 15:46.747
Say "libary." Mention "libary."

15:46.748 --> 15:48.514
"Libary."

15:48.515 --> 15:51.149
He a lie.
And how dare you talk about me

15:51.150 --> 15:52.350
behind me back?

15:52.351 --> 15:53.819
I tell you you're a broke nerd

15:53.820 --> 15:55.586
right to your broke nerd face.

15:55.587 --> 15:59.055
Oh, well, it's easy
to talk about this nobody

15:59.056 --> 16:01.291
and tell him he ain't nothing.
He knows that.

16:01.292 --> 16:03.892
That's why he's a grown man
sleeping on a couch.

16:03.893 --> 16:05.293
- Well...
- Okay?

16:05.294 --> 16:07.762
But I bet you you won't tell Ashley

16:07.763 --> 16:09.896
what you say about her to her face.

16:09.897 --> 16:11.231
- What?
- Marlon,

16:11.232 --> 16:12.832
now you're being ridiculous.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.233
Oh, really?

16:14.234 --> 16:15.334
Well,

16:16.202 --> 16:18.837
Yvette says she has to bring
her earbuds to church

16:18.838 --> 16:21.472
so she ain't got to hear you
sing your solo.

16:21.473 --> 16:24.373
Uh, he a lie, too!

16:24.374 --> 16:27.175
Uh, those are my Miracle-Ears

16:27.176 --> 16:28.477
so that I can, um,

16:28.478 --> 16:30.144
hear you better.

16:30.145 --> 16:32.079
Oh, she a lie!

16:32.080 --> 16:33.414
She said the notes you hit

16:33.415 --> 16:36.749
ain't even on a piano
or any other instrument.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.117
Not even the Indian sitars
with all the strings.

16:39.118 --> 16:41.486
Nothing!

16:41.487 --> 16:43.955
I can't sing?

16:43.956 --> 16:46.289
Well, you always stretch out

16:46.290 --> 16:48.424
the necks in my sweaters
when you borrow them.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.525
Did you hear that, or do you need

16:49.526 --> 16:50.726
your miracle buds?

16:50.727 --> 16:52.260
Oh, since you're keeping it real,

16:52.261 --> 16:54.128
why don't you tell her
how you said her weave

16:54.129 --> 16:55.163
smell like belly button?

16:55.164 --> 16:56.930
Oh-ho-ho!

16:56.931 --> 17:00.566
Ashley, lashing out
at Yvette isn't like you.

17:00.567 --> 17:01.667
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

17:02.369 --> 17:05.170
Don't sleep on the Queen
of Nice here, Stevie.

17:05.171 --> 17:07.471
Every time you drink coffee
at her house,

17:07.472 --> 17:08.571
she gets grossed out

17:09.406 --> 17:12.942
because you leave
little beard hairs in her cups.

17:12.943 --> 17:16.844
She calls them "face pubes."

17:16.845 --> 17:18.945
I'd never mock you behind your back.

17:18.946 --> 17:21.080
Oh, really?

17:21.082 --> 17:23.383
You specifically said

17:23.384 --> 17:25.150
that Ashley's hair color

17:25.151 --> 17:26.952
is way too close to her skin color

17:26.953 --> 17:30.922
and she look like a crayon.

17:30.923 --> 17:33.557
Beautiful crayon.
I said "beautiful crayon."

17:33.558 --> 17:34.924
Lies. He said you look

17:34.925 --> 17:38.327
like C-3PO with a wig.

17:38.328 --> 17:41.062
You know what?
Since we're keeping it 100,

17:41.063 --> 17:43.664
why don't you tell Diane and Roberto

17:43.665 --> 17:46.132
the real reason
you want to buy this house?

17:46.133 --> 17:47.200
Mm-hm.

17:47.201 --> 17:49.002
Oh, ha. Hey, hey.

17:49.003 --> 17:51.303
L-let's just pump the brakes
now, Ashley, huh?

17:51.304 --> 17:54.138
Oh, no, no, no, no.

17:54.139 --> 17:58.008
See, you grin, you're in.

17:58.009 --> 18:00.676
The only reason
Marlon wants to buy this house

18:00.677 --> 18:02.545
is because he needs a tax write-off,

18:02.546 --> 18:04.312
and he thinks that all of you

18:04.313 --> 18:07.080
are a bunch of stuck-up,
recycling douchebags.

18:07.081 --> 18:08.382
Mm-hm.

18:08.383 --> 18:10.050
That... that is not true.

18:10.051 --> 18:11.651
- Oh, really?
- That is not true,

18:11.652 --> 18:13.819
but I did say y'all look like
the auctioneers

18:13.820 --> 18:14.819
from the "Get Out" movie.

18:14.820 --> 18:16.354
I did say that. That was me.

18:17.757 --> 18:19.123
Then what is it?

18:19.124 --> 18:20.745
Why don't you tell us the real reason?

18:21.692 --> 18:23.326
I'm buying this house because I know

18:23.327 --> 18:25.707
there's no hope for me and you
ever getting back together.

18:33.868 --> 18:35.201
Mm.

18:35.202 --> 18:36.869
Face pube?

18:38.438 --> 18:40.338
Nasty.

18:42.818 --> 18:48.193
â™ª His eye is on the sparrow

18:48.194 --> 18:50.794
- Okay, I hear it now.
- Mm-hm.

18:50.795 --> 18:53.596
So why do I keep getting solos?

18:53.597 --> 18:58.800
Girl, pastor's trying to fornicate.

18:58.801 --> 19:00.434
You're fly.

19:00.435 --> 19:01.936
You just can't sing.

19:01.937 --> 19:04.771
Oh. Okay.

19:04.772 --> 19:06.305
Hello.

19:07.239 --> 19:09.540
I'd like to apologize to everyone.

19:10.676 --> 19:12.143
Keeping it 100

19:12.144 --> 19:13.778
was my idea,

19:13.779 --> 19:15.878
but my feelings got hurt.

19:18.380 --> 19:21.616
And I was.. childish... both: Mm-hm.

19:21.617 --> 19:24.219
And I was... what's that word, Stevie?

19:24.220 --> 19:26.453
- Petulant.
- I was petulant.

19:26.454 --> 19:27.988
Whatever the hell that means.

19:27.989 --> 19:30.890
It means childish.

19:30.891 --> 19:33.191
Marlon, can I talk to you
for a minute?

19:33.192 --> 19:35.060
Ashley, I just apologized,

19:35.061 --> 19:36.493
and... and used a white person word

19:36.494 --> 19:38.062
just so I could have
one of these long-ass talks

19:38.063 --> 19:40.530
on the couch.

19:40.531 --> 19:45.000
Now you made me
misuse the word "petulance."

19:45.001 --> 19:46.468
Marlon, I had no idea

19:46.469 --> 19:47.568
you were still thinking

19:47.569 --> 19:49.804
we might get back together.

19:49.805 --> 19:54.306
Girl, nobody checking for you.

19:54.307 --> 19:56.475
All right, look.

19:56.476 --> 19:59.344
When we first split up,

19:59.345 --> 20:02.179
I hoped it was gonna be temporary,

20:02.180 --> 20:04.914
so my place reflected that,

20:04.915 --> 20:06.649
but now that we're cool

20:06.650 --> 20:09.017
and I know that this is permanent,

20:09.018 --> 20:10.818
I want my place to reflect that.

20:12.219 --> 20:14.388
Well, keeping it 100, Marlon,

20:14.389 --> 20:16.089
I would never want you
to live somewhere

20:16.090 --> 20:17.523
you weren't comfortable.

20:17.524 --> 20:20.192
So why the hell you make me marry you?

20:20.193 --> 20:22.427
'Cause you knocked me up.
My daddy would've killed you.

20:22.428 --> 20:24.862
Good point.

20:24.863 --> 20:28.397
I saved your life.

20:29.499 --> 20:32.401
Listen, I was thinking, okay?

20:32.402 --> 20:34.435
Maybe keeping it 100,

20:34.436 --> 20:36.404
- we went too damn high.
- Mm.

20:36.405 --> 20:37.738
I mean, we black folk, we go there.

20:37.739 --> 20:39.706
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, we do.

20:39.707 --> 20:42.808
Maybe when we was married,
we kept at a phony 55.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.377
That wasn't cool,
so I think from now on,

20:45.378 --> 20:48.112
we just keep it a nice, balmy,

20:48.113 --> 20:51.215
77 with a slight breeze.

20:51.216 --> 20:52.714
Deal.

20:54.284 --> 20:57.085
You really didn't like my shams?

20:57.086 --> 20:58.753
77,

20:58.754 --> 21:00.588
they a'ight.

21:00.589 --> 21:02.155
And keeping it 100?

21:02.156 --> 21:03.757
Bitch, no.
