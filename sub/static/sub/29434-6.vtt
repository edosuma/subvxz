Pat Dolan.

00:08.089 --> 00:09.756
District attorney's dropping all charges

00:09.824 --> 00:12.192
regarding the murder of Cade Lasalle.

00:12.260 --> 00:14.061
You're a free man. Uncuff him.

00:15.096 --> 00:18.031
I-I don't understand.

00:18.099 --> 00:20.534
You alibied out.

00:20.601 --> 00:23.036
But... I killed him.

00:23.704 --> 00:26.273
I brought you the murder
weapon and-and confessed.

00:26.941 --> 00:28.842
We found holes in your story.

00:28.910 --> 00:30.610
Ai-Ain't no holes.

00:30.678 --> 00:31.878
Cade sought me out.

00:31.946 --> 00:33.380
He wanted to know more about the...

00:33.448 --> 00:36.783
opioids I was running with Stan Jenkins.

00:36.851 --> 00:39.119
Cade confronted you
outside Milner's Tavern.

00:39.187 --> 00:40.787
You two exchanged words.

00:40.855 --> 00:41.955
You pulled a knife.

00:42.023 --> 00:43.957
Stabbed him three times.

00:44.025 --> 00:45.792
It's like I said before, I-I didn't...

00:45.860 --> 00:48.462
mean for it to go that far, but it did.

00:48.529 --> 00:50.063
- I panicked.
- Yeah.

00:50.131 --> 00:52.371
Stashed his body in your truck,
drove it out to the woods

00:52.395 --> 00:54.034
and burned it. We know.

00:54.102 --> 00:55.869
It's all here in your...

00:55.937 --> 00:57.270
"confession".

00:57.338 --> 00:59.906
Exactly.

00:59.974 --> 01:02.976
I can't live with this on my conscience.

01:03.044 --> 01:05.612
Why I brought in the knife.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.882
Whatever judgement comes my way,

01:08.950 --> 01:10.951
His will be done.

01:12.453 --> 01:13.987
How do you explain this?

01:14.055 --> 01:16.256
Nothing to explain. It's me

01:16.324 --> 01:17.958
at Milner's Tavern.

01:18.026 --> 01:21.228
Security cameras placed
you there between

01:21.295 --> 01:22.562
7:00 p.m. and midnight.

01:22.630 --> 01:23.964
So what?

01:24.032 --> 01:25.165
Cade didn't receive burns

01:25.233 --> 01:27.100
across his entire body.

01:27.168 --> 01:28.902
Livor mortis

01:28.970 --> 01:30.804
was present,

01:30.872 --> 01:33.240
and my coroner determined
a time of death

01:33.307 --> 01:34.908
from the knife wounds

01:34.976 --> 01:38.011
between 9:00 and 11:00.

01:38.079 --> 01:41.481
How'd you manage to stab him?

01:41.549 --> 01:43.517
Never left the bar.

01:43.584 --> 01:45.952
I killed that man.

01:46.020 --> 01:48.355
I'm ready to pay for my crimes.

01:48.423 --> 01:49.790
Why are you confessing to a murder

01:49.858 --> 01:51.368
- you didn't commit?! Huh?!
- Christopher.

01:51.392 --> 01:52.993
- Hey, hey.
- Who gave you that knife?!

01:53.061 --> 01:55.095
- Who are you covering for?! Huh?!
- Christopher.

01:59.567 --> 02:00.801
You got anything else to add,

02:00.868 --> 02:03.437
Mr. Dolan?

02:09.009 --> 02:10.610
We're done here.

02:10.678 --> 02:13.180
You see the look on Dolan's face?

02:13.247 --> 02:15.382
He's scared to leave.

02:15.450 --> 02:17.970
Like he's more afraid of the
person he's covering for than he is

02:17.994 --> 02:19.619
of a potential life sentence.

02:19.687 --> 02:21.955
Maybe he's explaining
to whoever he's calling

02:22.023 --> 02:24.357
- why he's been cut loose.
- Yeah.

02:24.425 --> 02:27.027
Got Patton tracking calls in the area.

02:28.177 --> 02:30.554
See if he gets a hit
on who he's talking to.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.801
All right, Dolan.

02:34.869 --> 02:38.238

03:00.328 --> 03:01.361
No.

Has Patton found out who Dolan contacted

03:36.998 --> 03:38.431
as soon as he was set free?

03:38.499 --> 03:40.367
Call went to another unknown number.

03:40.434 --> 03:42.369
Patton tried to remotely tap it, but...

03:42.436 --> 03:45.438
the battery must've been
stripped before Dolan hung up.

03:45.506 --> 03:47.641
Any idea why Dolan killed himself?

03:47.708 --> 03:49.609
His confession didn't stick.

03:49.677 --> 03:51.478
And it appears that taking a fatal dive

03:51.546 --> 03:53.547
is an easier way out than failure.

03:53.614 --> 03:54.781
Who would he be failing?

03:54.849 --> 03:56.550
Whoever's pulling the strings.

03:56.617 --> 03:59.419
We have yet to meet the
great Oz behind the curtain.

03:59.487 --> 04:00.654
Okay, what can we do to help?

04:00.721 --> 04:01.888
Need you to dig into

04:01.956 --> 04:03.790
Pat Dolan.

04:03.858 --> 04:05.725
He took extreme action
to protect someone.

04:05.793 --> 04:08.962
Got to be a bread crumb
that'll lead us to who.

04:09.030 --> 04:10.510
Okay, no problem. We're on it, Pride.

04:10.534 --> 04:13.066
Sebastian, grab your kit.

04:13.134 --> 04:14.801
Need you to meet me and Lasalle here.

04:14.869 --> 04:18.171
He's searching Dolan's apartment
now, but we could use your help.

04:18.238 --> 04:19.599
Yeah, I can be there in two hours.

04:19.623 --> 04:21.391
Hurry.

04:32.486 --> 04:34.154
Excuse me, ma'am...

04:44.398 --> 04:45.565
- Aah! Help!
- Hey.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.633
- Help! Somebody call the police!
- Hey, calm down.

04:47.657 --> 04:49.336
Calm down. I am the police. Calm down.

04:49.403 --> 04:52.172
- You gonna let go of me?
- Look. Look. Yes, look.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.873
NCIS?

04:53.941 --> 04:55.181
- Sounds fake.
- Well, it's not.

04:55.243 --> 04:57.043
All right? I'm a federal agent

04:57.111 --> 04:59.045
investigating a murder.

04:59.113 --> 05:01.214
Hey, look, I'm, I'm sorry for running.

05:01.282 --> 05:04.050
But it's what you do when
you find a strange man

05:04.118 --> 05:05.885
inside your boyfriend's apartment.

05:06.753 --> 05:08.622
You're Pat Dolan's girlfriend?

05:08.689 --> 05:09.723
What's your name?

05:09.790 --> 05:11.358
Sue-Ann Hughes.

05:11.425 --> 05:13.994
Well, what are you
doing here, Ms. Hughes?

05:14.061 --> 05:16.329
Well, I just came by to
get Pat a shirt and tie

05:16.397 --> 05:18.064
for his arraignment.

05:18.132 --> 05:20.567
He's due before a judge this afternoon.

05:22.637 --> 05:25.639
Pat killed himself earlier today.

05:28.209 --> 05:29.976
He-He's d...

05:30.044 --> 05:31.811
he's dead?

05:33.680 --> 05:35.248
I'm sorry, ma'am.

05:38.386 --> 05:41.254
Damn it, I knew this would happen.

05:41.322 --> 05:44.591
You were afraid he would commit suicide?

05:44.659 --> 05:47.160
I was afraid he was in over his head.

05:47.228 --> 05:48.528
Over his head how?

05:48.596 --> 05:50.530
With his-his new friends.

05:50.598 --> 05:52.265
They're a bad influence.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.333
What friends?

05:53.401 --> 05:55.702
The same ones who got him wrapped up

05:55.770 --> 05:57.730
in some murder he didn't
have anything to do with.

05:59.507 --> 06:01.274
Cade Lasalle.

06:03.444 --> 06:06.012
Your badge.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.315
Agent Lasalle.

06:10.751 --> 06:13.086
He was my brother.

06:13.454 --> 06:15.522
Here you go.

06:17.158 --> 06:18.291
Please,

06:18.359 --> 06:19.959
you have to know...

06:20.027 --> 06:22.629
Pat, he didn't have no
appetite for murder.

06:22.697 --> 06:24.197
I know he didn't kill my brother.

06:24.265 --> 06:25.865
Finally somebody believes me.

06:25.933 --> 06:28.535
But he did cover up for the real killer.

06:28.602 --> 06:30.603
Why would he do that?

06:30.671 --> 06:32.439
I don't know.

06:32.506 --> 06:36.076
But he was anxious these past few weeks.

06:36.143 --> 06:38.912
It started just as he was
hanging around those guys.

06:38.979 --> 06:40.246
But who are they?

06:40.314 --> 06:42.415
Did he ever mention synthetic opioids?

06:42.483 --> 06:43.917
Look, I didn't know the details.

06:43.984 --> 06:46.419
I just knew they were up to no good.

06:46.487 --> 06:49.789
Did Pat ever say how they connected?

06:49.857 --> 06:51.391
What any of 'em looked like?

06:51.459 --> 06:53.326
I'm sorry. I don't know.

06:54.862 --> 06:56.229
But he did meet up with them

06:56.297 --> 06:57.931
a few days ago.

06:57.998 --> 06:59.032
How do you know that?

06:59.100 --> 07:01.134
Pat and I were on our
way to see a movie.

07:01.202 --> 07:02.902
He got a call.

07:02.970 --> 07:04.904
Told me the movie would have to wait.

07:04.972 --> 07:08.241
He flipped the car around and
drove us out to the country.

07:08.309 --> 07:09.609
Where'd he take you to?

07:09.677 --> 07:11.344
Some cabin in the middle of nowhere.

07:11.912 --> 07:13.680
All these antlers everywhere.

07:13.748 --> 07:14.881
Hunting cabin?

07:14.949 --> 07:16.950
Sure, I guess.

07:17.017 --> 07:18.457
Well, he told me to wait in the car,

07:18.481 --> 07:20.754
but I heard him talking
to somebody inside.

07:20.821 --> 07:22.122
You hear what they said?

07:22.189 --> 07:24.491
Not a word.

07:26.494 --> 07:29.696
Can you remember anything
else that might help?

07:29.764 --> 07:31.765
Uh...

07:33.768 --> 07:35.168
Wait.

07:35.236 --> 07:36.436
Yeah, when Pat walked out,

07:36.504 --> 07:38.438
he was carrying a knife.

07:38.506 --> 07:41.374
But he didn't have no
knife when he walked in.

07:41.442 --> 07:43.610
Must be the murder
weapon he surrendered.

07:43.677 --> 07:46.179
Can you take me to this cabin?

07:46.247 --> 07:48.047
Look, Pat was driving.

07:48.115 --> 07:49.435
I wasn't exactly paying attention

07:49.503 --> 07:50.503
to where we were headed.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.718
Sue-Ann, please,

07:52.786 --> 07:54.586
try to remember.

07:54.722 --> 07:58.024
Okay, my brother... I
need to find his killer.

07:58.092 --> 07:59.559
He deserves justice.

08:01.228 --> 08:04.130
Sebastian will be here
within the hour, Christopher.

08:04.198 --> 08:05.732
Hold tight and I'll come join you.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.301
Might take a while to
find this cabin, King.

08:08.369 --> 08:10.303
You and Sebastian can
process Dolan's apartment

08:10.371 --> 08:12.338
while I look for it with his girlfriend.

08:12.406 --> 08:14.040
I know what you want,

08:14.108 --> 08:16.410
but rushing the
investigation won't help.

08:16.477 --> 08:19.179
Hey, whoever's behind this keeps
being one step ahead of us.

08:19.246 --> 08:21.381
All right, if Cade was
killed at that cabin,

08:21.449 --> 08:23.416
I can't afford to lose the crime scene.

08:23.484 --> 08:24.584
We can't.

08:24.652 --> 08:27.020
- You're not doing this alone, Chris.
- I know,

08:27.087 --> 08:28.121
and I appreciate it.

08:28.188 --> 08:29.489
Take Route 45.

08:29.557 --> 08:31.758
- We took that toward the state line.
- I'll check in

08:31.826 --> 08:34.327
once we get closer to
finding this cabin.

08:34.395 --> 08:36.195
Tell me if you and
Sebastian turn up anything.

08:36.219 --> 08:37.620
Will do.

08:47.741 --> 08:50.376
Yep. This is it.

08:50.444 --> 08:52.044
You sure?

08:52.068 --> 08:54.228
That cabin was a horror
movie in the daylight.

08:54.348 --> 08:56.049
I'm sure.

08:57.852 --> 08:59.719
- Christopher?
- Hey, Pride. We found it.

08:59.787 --> 09:02.355
Have Sebastian lock in on the location.

09:02.423 --> 09:04.343
All right, Chris, hang tight.
We're minutes away.

09:04.367 --> 09:05.491
Roger that.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.698
You see that?

09:12.365 --> 09:13.700
See what?

09:13.767 --> 09:15.668
Stay in the truck.

09:53.173 --> 09:55.241
It's just me.

09:55.309 --> 09:57.644
What part of "stay in the
truck" was confusing to you?

09:57.711 --> 09:59.979
Sorry. I got scared out there alone.

10:00.047 --> 10:01.748
Dang near took your head off.

10:01.815 --> 10:04.484
Did you find anything?

10:04.552 --> 10:05.818
Yeah.

10:05.886 --> 10:06.919
Oh.

10:06.987 --> 10:09.022
Oh, geez.

10:10.189 --> 10:11.591
Do you think that's where...

10:11.659 --> 10:14.427
It has to be.

10:14.495 --> 10:15.695
This is where Cade was killed.

10:17.698 --> 10:18.698
Sue-Ann!

10:32.394 --> 10:33.603
Christopher?

10:36.817 --> 10:38.251
God, no.

10:42.523 --> 10:43.990
Christopher.

10:48.562 --> 10:49.929
Call 911.

11:00.228 --> 11:02.596
- Incoming.
- Female, single GSW

11:02.663 --> 11:04.931
to the left shoulder.
BP 120/80 and steady.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.759
- Send her to Trauma 3.
- Male, multiple GSWs

11:06.783 --> 11:08.168
to abdomen and right arm.

11:08.236 --> 11:09.536
BP 80/60 and falling.

11:09.604 --> 11:10.704
Watch the door...

11:10.772 --> 11:12.372
Get him to the OR
and call Dr. Hernandez.

11:12.396 --> 11:14.107
- Yes, ma'am.
- Trauma 3. This way.

11:14.175 --> 11:16.153
- Pride, Pride, you can't go back there.
- Sir, sir, you have to stay back.

11:16.177 --> 11:17.554
- You can't go back there.
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:17.578 --> 11:18.778
- Christopher?
- Pride, listen.

11:18.802 --> 11:20.447
Let go of me, Sebastian! Let go of me!

11:20.515 --> 11:22.115
You can't do any more, Pride. Stay back.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.150
Let 'em work,

11:23.217 --> 11:25.118
come on.

11:25.186 --> 11:27.220
- 100%.
- Okay, let's open him up.

11:27.288 --> 11:29.523
- I need to see the damage.
- Forceps, Doctor.

11:29.590 --> 11:33.126
We've got bullet fragments
all over the place in here.

11:36.531 --> 11:37.864
Hey.

11:37.932 --> 11:39.232
Is he out of surgery?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.134
We don't know yet.

11:41.202 --> 11:42.535
Who's the trauma surgeon on duty?

11:42.603 --> 11:44.504
- Dr. Hernandez.
- Oh, good.

11:44.572 --> 11:46.840
He's in the right hands. And Dwayne?

11:46.908 --> 11:48.908
He's outside the OR waiting on any word.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.523
Hey, uh, they-they...

11:52.547 --> 11:54.648
They just, uh, closed him up,

11:54.715 --> 11:57.384
and it's a waiting game now, so...

11:59.253 --> 12:02.889
I-I got to him too
late, Loretta. I... I...

12:02.957 --> 12:07.794
You airlifted him to the best
trauma center in three states.

12:08.830 --> 12:10.764
Yeah.

12:10.832 --> 12:12.933
Uh, Christopher's, uh, stepmother?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.368
Already contacted Rose.
She's on her way now.

12:15.436 --> 12:17.537
I called Kelly and Will.
They're sending up prayers.

12:17.605 --> 12:18.872
Hunting cabin.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.540
Local PD and the FBI are on the scene.

12:20.608 --> 12:21.952
I'm in direct contact. They're
gonna keep me updated

12:21.976 --> 12:23.487
- every hour.
- I need the names and numbers

12:23.511 --> 12:24.788
of every team leader on
the ground, all right?

12:24.812 --> 12:26.179
Yeah, we can make that happen.

12:26.247 --> 12:27.714
Yeah, I'll see if I can get

12:27.782 --> 12:29.583
a courtesy update from

12:29.650 --> 12:31.418
- the surgical team.
- Okay. Hey,

12:31.486 --> 12:33.553
thank you, Loretta.

12:33.621 --> 12:35.856
Volunteer Services to Oncology.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.591
Sebastian.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.760
You okay?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.296
Uh...

12:43.664 --> 12:45.465
I-I'm covered in my-my friend's blood.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.200
Yeah.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.571
We'll get you cleaned up,
get you some fresh clothes.

12:50.638 --> 12:52.583
- All right?
- What I... what I need to do is

12:52.607 --> 12:54.407
I need to... I need to
get back to that cabin,

12:54.475 --> 12:56.710
- you know, process the scene.
- We got half a dozen

12:56.777 --> 12:59.112
law enforcement agencies
scouring the area for suspects,

12:59.180 --> 13:01.481
three different CSU teams tearing

13:01.549 --> 13:03.884
- that cabin apart.
- None of 'em are me.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.152
Well, you're not really
you right now, baby.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.588
They'll pass along whatever they find.

13:08.656 --> 13:10.123
- Okay?
- Okay.

13:10.191 --> 13:12.893
Okay, well, I-I should, um...

13:12.960 --> 13:15.228
I should go to Chris's place.

13:15.287 --> 13:17.007
- You know, I should pack him a bag.
- Okay.

13:17.031 --> 13:18.842
You know, he's gonna need clothes,
he's gonna need a-a shave kit,

13:18.866 --> 13:20.306
- other stuff before he-he...
- Yeah.

13:20.330 --> 13:21.690
...you know, he walks out of here.

13:21.714 --> 13:22.852
Sure. Great.

13:26.207 --> 13:28.308
You're thinking, "If
he walks out of here".

13:30.678 --> 13:33.313
I don't even know what
I'm thinking right now, but...

13:35.883 --> 13:37.817
I know Lasalle's a fighter, and...

13:37.885 --> 13:40.520
he'll pull through.

13:40.588 --> 13:42.656
Can't promise that.

13:42.723 --> 13:44.524
Of course I can't promise that.

13:44.592 --> 13:47.093
But I have faith in him,

13:47.161 --> 13:51.464
the same way he's always
had faith in all of us.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.801
All right, you've got this,
Sebastian. You ready?

13:54.869 --> 13:56.937
Ready as Tony Stark when
he burst out of that cave

13:57.004 --> 13:58.371
in the Mark 1 suit.

13:58.439 --> 14:00.273
- Ready? Set.
- Yeah.

14:00.341 --> 14:02.175
Go.

14:02.243 --> 14:03.777
Nice. Nice.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.713
Head on a swivel.

14:07.592 --> 14:08.592
Nice. Knees bent.

14:08.616 --> 14:10.016
Smooth.

14:10.084 --> 14:11.217
Smooth.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.688
Moves fast. Here we go.

14:14.755 --> 14:16.690
Tactical reload. Tactical reload.

14:16.757 --> 14:18.158
Yes.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.627
Go, go, go, go! Yes.

14:24.398 --> 14:26.232
- Wooo!
- That's what I'm talking about!

14:26.300 --> 14:27.968
Like a deadly gazelle.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.536
So?

14:29.604 --> 14:30.971
New record.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.239
90% hit-rate.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.177
- What?
- NCIS REACT Team's gonna be

14:35.202 --> 14:36.767
lucky to have you, Sebastian.

14:36.811 --> 14:39.412
- Ah.
- But you know what?

14:39.480 --> 14:41.648
90 ain't 100.

14:41.716 --> 14:43.483
- Back to one.
- Are you serious?

14:43.551 --> 14:44.715
Yeah, I'm serious, let's go,

14:44.740 --> 14:46.275
- roll, roll, come on.
- Well, I-I...

14:49.256 --> 14:51.024
We performed an emergency laparotomy,

14:51.092 --> 14:54.894
and his vitals are stable... for now.

14:56.397 --> 14:58.064
He's not out of the woods yet.

14:58.132 --> 15:00.100
Far from it.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.036
We extracted all the fragments
from one of the bullets,

15:03.104 --> 15:06.006
but the other is lodged in his spine.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.841
Oh, can't you remove it?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.876
Eventually.

15:09.944 --> 15:11.711
There was a lot of internal damage.

15:11.779 --> 15:15.615
Attempting surgery at this
juncture would prove more risky

15:15.683 --> 15:17.884
than just letting it be for now.

15:17.952 --> 15:20.453
The next 24 hours are critical.

15:20.521 --> 15:23.056
But the fact that he's
still here with us?

15:23.124 --> 15:25.258
He wants to hold on.

15:27.762 --> 15:29.729
Dwayne?

15:29.797 --> 15:32.932
T-shirt. You need to
change your clothes.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.602
I'll sit with him.

15:35.670 --> 15:37.037
You need to take a break.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.206
Wash your face, get some fresh air.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.375
Look, I'm-I'm... I'm okay,
Loretta. I can stay...

15:42.443 --> 15:44.444
Dwayne Pride.

16:02.063 --> 16:05.432
Dr. Nelson, dial 9812.

16:05.499 --> 16:07.500
Dr. Nelson, 9812.

16:08.869 --> 16:10.937
There you go, boss.

16:11.005 --> 16:12.405
I was going to get some coffee.

16:12.473 --> 16:14.507
Wanted to know if you want anything.

16:16.510 --> 16:19.512
No, no, I... I-I-I'm
okay, Patton, thanks.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.282
Doubt if you remember the last time

16:22.349 --> 16:25.985
you was in there... but I sure do.

16:26.053 --> 16:29.255
I was in that room,
three holes in my chest.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.158
Gave us more than a scare.

16:32.226 --> 16:33.793
But you pulled through.

16:33.861 --> 16:35.662
So will Lasalle.

16:37.398 --> 16:39.432
I'm on the other side with you now.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.336
No longer the patient,
just the agonized family.

16:43.404 --> 16:46.306
We've both made our fair
share of hospital visits.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.974
But when it's family...

16:48.042 --> 16:49.509
Yeah, it's different.

16:50.544 --> 16:52.479
You afraid?

16:55.148 --> 16:56.616
Yeah, I am.

17:11.732 --> 17:14.400
Christopher, I'm here.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.236
Hey there.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.071
We were all so scared.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.040
I missed you.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.210
We missed you.

17:24.278 --> 17:26.279
Yeah.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.117
Let's go fishing, Cade.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.028
Christopher, no!

17:42.096 --> 17:44.536
Code Blue!
Code Blue! Room Four! Code Blue.

17:44.598 --> 17:46.766
Coming in. Crash cart to Room Four.

17:46.834 --> 17:50.403
Give me hands for trauma.
Prep one amp of epi.

17:50.471 --> 17:52.739
- No pulse.
- Behind you. I'll bag him.

17:52.807 --> 17:55.041
- Commencing CPR.
- Let's start with 200.

17:55.109 --> 17:56.442
Charged.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.845
Clear!

17:58.913 --> 18:00.046
V-fib. No response.

18:00.114 --> 18:01.581
Dwayne, you can't go in...

18:01.649 --> 18:04.017
- O2 at high flow.
- Let's go again.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.919
- Give me 300.
- Charged.

18:05.986 --> 18:07.420
Clear!

18:09.356 --> 18:11.124
Nothing. Patient's decompensating.

18:11.192 --> 18:12.192
Increasing bitrate.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.194
Go up to 360.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.508
Charged.

18:15.733 --> 18:16.953
Clear!

18:17.197 --> 18:18.565
Come on.

18:18.633 --> 18:19.721
- No response.
- Come on.

18:19.746 --> 18:21.033
Flatline on all leads, Doctor.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.505
Okay.

18:26.707 --> 18:30.143
Okay. That's enough.

18:31.283 --> 18:32.923
No, no, no, no, please,
there-there's got,

18:32.947 --> 18:34.427
- there's got to be something.
- Time?

18:34.451 --> 18:35.368
- Time?
- Something...

18:35.392 --> 18:36.912
There's got to be something you can...

18:36.936 --> 18:38.484
- 7:02.
- No.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.027
No. No.

18:40.752 --> 18:42.579
Please, no.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.023
- I'm sorry.
- No, there's got to be

18:44.047 --> 18:45.083
something that you can...

18:45.127 --> 18:46.826
I'm sorry, Agent Pride.

19:10.327 --> 19:12.929
I don't understand.

19:12.997 --> 19:14.631
Doctor said he was stable.

19:15.499 --> 19:18.000
And he was...

19:18.068 --> 19:20.303
until he wasn't.

19:58.775 --> 20:00.910
We need to get Christopher home.

20:03.748 --> 20:06.182
I'm gonna take him back to my morgue.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.784
Loretta, you don't have to do that.

20:07.852 --> 20:10.821
Oh, yes, I do. He deserves
a proper autopsy.

20:11.789 --> 20:14.224
But you don't need to be
the one to perform it.

20:14.292 --> 20:15.859
He was murdered, Dwayne.

20:16.227 --> 20:19.029
This isn't some simple heart attack.

20:19.096 --> 20:20.597
And I'm the one most qualified

20:20.665 --> 20:22.399
to perform the necessary autopsy.

20:24.234 --> 20:26.102
You're right.

20:30.007 --> 20:31.141
Hey, boss,

20:31.208 --> 20:33.176
we need to talk about Sue-Ann Hughes.

20:33.744 --> 20:34.978
What? Dolan's girlfriend?

20:35.046 --> 20:36.446
She witnessed Lasalle's murder.

20:36.514 --> 20:38.782
That's why I think her
meeting him was no accident.

20:38.850 --> 20:40.550
Well, she did arrive at the apartment

20:40.618 --> 20:43.387
right when... when
Christopher was there, but...

20:43.454 --> 20:46.757
And the shooter was waiting for
him to show up at that cabin.

20:46.824 --> 20:48.792
You thinking he was led into a trap?

20:48.860 --> 20:51.094
I'm thinking their
relationship was a fraud.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.122
- What are you talking about?
- Lasalle had me dig

20:53.146 --> 20:54.831
into Dolan when he
was finding the alibi.

20:54.899 --> 20:57.968
So if he was dating Sue-Ann,
they was doing it on the DL.

20:58.036 --> 20:59.836
What makes you think that?

20:59.904 --> 21:02.406
There's nothing in Dolan's
file that connects to Sue-Ann.

21:02.473 --> 21:04.441
No text message, no phone calls.

21:04.509 --> 21:06.977
That means that Sue-Ann's
got a story to share.

21:07.545 --> 21:09.979
And I'm gonna hear it.

21:10.047 --> 21:11.481
Thanks.

21:15.753 --> 21:18.655
You're that federal agent, right?

21:20.357 --> 21:22.625
You and the tall one brought me here?

21:22.693 --> 21:24.260
Special Agent Pride.

21:24.328 --> 21:25.829
NCIS.

21:25.896 --> 21:28.431
How's Agent Lasalle?

21:30.267 --> 21:33.002
Special Agent Lasalle is dead.

21:33.070 --> 21:35.505
I'm so sorry.

21:37.541 --> 21:38.908
Are you, Ms. Hughes?

21:40.244 --> 21:41.978
Well, what do you mean?

21:42.646 --> 21:45.682
You showed up at Pat Dolan's apartment

21:45.749 --> 21:47.750
just as Chris...

21:50.688 --> 21:52.655
...just as my agent was there.

21:52.723 --> 21:54.624
Well, I didn't even know Pat was dead

21:54.692 --> 21:56.292
until Agent Lasalle told me.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.061
Okay.

21:58.128 --> 22:00.897
But then you guided
him to a hunting cabin

22:00.965 --> 22:03.967
where someone was lying
in wait to kill him.

22:04.034 --> 22:06.035
Now, some might call that

22:06.103 --> 22:08.504
a coincidence.

22:08.572 --> 22:11.374
Well, that same coincidence
almost got me killed, too.

22:11.442 --> 22:12.882
I think you're covering for someone.

22:15.279 --> 22:17.146
Who shot my agent, Sue-Ann?

22:18.549 --> 22:20.516
You know.

22:20.584 --> 22:21.885
- Tell me.
- Excuse me.

22:21.952 --> 22:24.821
Who are you?

22:24.889 --> 22:25.969
Special Agent Dwayne Pride.

22:25.993 --> 22:27.757
Who the hell are you?

22:27.825 --> 22:29.826
Eddie Barrett.

22:29.894 --> 22:31.594
NCIS, yes.

22:31.662 --> 22:33.730
You brought my daughter
here. I can't thank you

22:33.797 --> 22:35.899
and the other agents enough.

22:35.966 --> 22:39.669
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

22:39.737 --> 22:43.006
He thinks I got his agent killed.

22:43.073 --> 22:45.541
I didn't know he died.

22:45.609 --> 22:47.110
Passed earlier this morning.

22:47.177 --> 22:49.846
I'm so sorry.

22:49.914 --> 22:52.282
But how is that Sue-Ann's fault?

22:52.349 --> 22:53.669
Pat Dolan was protecting a killer

22:53.693 --> 22:55.385
and your daughter is, too.

22:55.452 --> 22:57.087
I loved Pat.

22:57.155 --> 22:59.289
Well, that's a lie, Sue-Ann.

22:59.457 --> 23:01.324
Because there's no digital
evidence to suggest

23:01.492 --> 23:03.660
the two of you were dating.

23:04.028 --> 23:05.262
W-Why are you doing this?

23:05.330 --> 23:07.097
You need to tell me
who was at that cabin.

23:07.364 --> 23:08.698
- Okay.
- Tell me.

23:08.766 --> 23:09.766
That's enough.

23:10.033 --> 23:12.035
Can we talk outside?

23:12.102 --> 23:13.503
Please?

23:15.105 --> 23:16.806
Look, your daughter knows

23:16.874 --> 23:18.141
who the shooter is.

23:18.208 --> 23:19.542
She doesn't.

23:19.610 --> 23:21.144
And what you don't know

23:21.211 --> 23:24.881
is that her last boyfriend
was an abusive stalker.

23:24.949 --> 23:27.116
He found out Sue-Ann was dating again,

23:27.184 --> 23:29.152
and didn't take it well.

23:29.219 --> 23:30.720
I suggested to her and Pat

23:30.788 --> 23:32.822
they keep things quiet
until he cooled off.

23:32.890 --> 23:34.090
This ex-boyfriend have a name?

23:34.158 --> 23:35.458
Cameron Jones.

23:35.526 --> 23:39.796
He hurt Sue-Ann for years,
until she was finally saved.

23:39.863 --> 23:42.165
- Does Mr. Jones have a record?
- A long one.

23:42.232 --> 23:45.301
Sue-Ann is terrified of him.

23:45.369 --> 23:48.972
I didn't want to risk anything
happening to her or Pat.

23:49.039 --> 23:50.740
I will follow up on that.

23:50.808 --> 23:52.308
I get that you're angry.

23:52.376 --> 23:54.744
I could just as easily be
standing in your shoes,

23:54.812 --> 23:57.480
and I'd be angry, too.

23:57.548 --> 23:59.248
But accusing her like you just did

23:59.316 --> 24:01.017
isn't gonna bring your agent back.

24:05.022 --> 24:06.522
Thank you.

24:06.590 --> 24:08.491
I'll... I'll take care of him.

24:08.559 --> 24:10.093

ought to been there... ♪

24:27.878 --> 24:29.512

24:31.684 --> 24:32.748
Not expecting,

24:32.816 --> 24:35.385
but I was a little bit
disappointed there weren't any.

24:35.452 --> 24:36.686
- Oh.
- Thank you.

24:36.754 --> 24:38.454
Oh. Hey, I want to thank you

24:38.522 --> 24:40.256
for taking me up on my offer to visit.

24:40.324 --> 24:41.422
It means a lot.

24:41.447 --> 24:43.817
I enjoyed the preacher's
message very much.

24:43.861 --> 24:46.229
This month, we've been going
through the Beatitudes.

24:46.296 --> 24:48.798
Ah. They've been very close to my heart.

24:48.866 --> 24:50.533
Love and humility.

24:50.601 --> 24:52.761
- It's a good guidebook for life.
- You got that right.

24:52.785 --> 24:54.837
I could see the love
of the congregation.

24:54.905 --> 24:57.140
I can understand why you're
so connected to them.

24:57.207 --> 24:58.908
Yeah, everyone here accepted me

24:58.976 --> 25:01.577
with open arms in my time of need.

25:01.645 --> 25:03.346
After Savannah's death?

25:03.414 --> 25:05.415
Yeah, I was spinning out of control.

25:05.482 --> 25:07.550
And they didn't judge.

25:07.618 --> 25:09.018
Offered me a sanctuary.

25:09.086 --> 25:10.820
This community never gave up on me.

25:10.888 --> 25:14.023
Mm. They say, "Blessed
are the peacemakers,

25:14.091 --> 25:16.325
for they shall be called
the children of God".

25:16.393 --> 25:19.162
Look at you quoting Scripture.

25:20.898 --> 25:22.098
That's next week's sermon.

25:22.166 --> 25:23.866
Oh, come on.

Thank you, Christopher.

25:51.795 --> 25:53.729
Hello.

25:53.797 --> 25:55.731
- Sebastian.
- Yeah.

25:55.799 --> 25:58.134
I need a list of every individual

25:58.202 --> 26:00.803
who was in physical contact with Lasalle

26:00.871 --> 26:02.872
after he left the cabin.

26:02.940 --> 26:04.874
Okay. What's happening?

26:04.942 --> 26:08.978
We need to start
eliminating DNA samples.

26:09.046 --> 26:11.114
- You got one?
- Yes.

26:23.861 --> 26:25.995
- Oh, Pride.
- Sorry.

26:26.063 --> 26:28.097
I didn't mean to scare you.

26:28.165 --> 26:30.933
I just... I-I wanted to see
if you found anything

26:31.001 --> 26:32.735
on Sue-Ann's ex-boyfriend.

26:32.803 --> 26:34.937
Yeah, that guy's a scumbag.

26:35.005 --> 26:39.275
Uh, she had got a restraining
order against him.

26:39.343 --> 26:40.743
So that could explain

26:40.811 --> 26:42.912
- her careful relationship with Dolan.
- Yeah.

26:42.980 --> 26:45.314
What do you got on the cabin?

26:45.382 --> 26:47.350
Elderly owner hadn't
used it in a decade.

26:47.417 --> 26:51.487
FBI and local PD are scouring
every route in and out.

26:51.555 --> 26:53.623
Yeah. That's a lot of woods to cover.

26:53.690 --> 26:56.359
I feel like Hannah and I
should get out there and...

26:56.426 --> 26:57.593
and join the search.

26:57.661 --> 27:01.330
I... just... it's really best...

27:01.398 --> 27:03.199
How long has it been since you slept?

27:03.267 --> 27:06.702
Well, same as you. What does it matter?

27:06.770 --> 27:08.037
You're no good to the team

27:08.105 --> 27:09.672
if you're walking around like a zombie.

27:09.740 --> 27:11.574
Yeah. Go-go lie down.

27:11.642 --> 27:13.202
- I'll make the coffee.
- No, it's fine.

27:13.226 --> 27:14.310
- I...
- I got it.

27:14.378 --> 27:15.938
- I got it. I got it.
- I'll make the...

27:15.962 --> 27:16.979
I got it.

27:18.373 --> 27:19.606
God.

27:19.950 --> 27:22.685
You know, you don't always
have to take care of us.

27:27.391 --> 27:30.393
Why don't you tell me
how are you holding up?

27:33.797 --> 27:36.132
Trying to get closure...

27:36.200 --> 27:38.734
by catching Lasalle's killer.

27:38.802 --> 27:41.804
But will it... bring closure?

27:41.872 --> 27:44.340
It'll bring justice for Chris.

27:44.408 --> 27:46.976
And after that?

27:47.044 --> 27:50.046
What are you getting at, Gregorio?

27:52.816 --> 27:54.450
He's gone.

27:56.453 --> 27:59.455
I know you want to fix
that, but you can't.

28:03.961 --> 28:05.761
All right, then.

28:05.829 --> 28:08.664
All right.

28:08.732 --> 28:11.734
You make the coffee.

28:11.802 --> 28:14.670
Guys, we got something.

28:19.009 --> 28:21.944
Chris may have just
handed us his killer.

28:22.012 --> 28:25.114
Our boy's working his own murder
case from beyond the grave.

28:25.182 --> 28:27.950
Wade found broken fingernails
on Chris's right hand

28:28.018 --> 28:29.919
and foreign skin cells beneath.

28:29.987 --> 28:31.220
Sebastian get a DNA match?

28:31.288 --> 28:32.922
Just sent the files.

28:32.990 --> 28:35.424
Oh, that's Sue-Ann's father.

28:35.492 --> 28:37.627
I met him at the hospital.

28:37.694 --> 28:40.062
He-he said his name was Eddie.

28:40.130 --> 28:42.698
Edward Barrett, 42 years old.

28:42.766 --> 28:44.700
But Eddie doesn't have any children.

28:46.136 --> 28:47.603
I had him.

28:49.106 --> 28:51.774
He was right there under my nose.

28:53.710 --> 28:55.111
Let's get this son of a bitch.

29:02.725 --> 29:04.459
Need you to blast out BOLOs

29:04.527 --> 29:06.061
across the entire region, Captain.

29:06.129 --> 29:07.796
Every neighboring state.

29:07.864 --> 29:08.997
Yeah, thank you.

29:09.065 --> 29:10.832
NOPD missed them at the hospital?

29:10.900 --> 29:14.870
Sue-Ann was discharged
to Eddie a few hours ago.

29:14.938 --> 29:18.840
And he paid her $20,000
hospital bill in cash.

29:18.908 --> 29:20.948
If Eddie was walking around
with that kind of money,

29:20.972 --> 29:22.511
he was definitely connected

29:22.579 --> 29:24.499
to that opioid ring that
you and Chris took down.

29:24.523 --> 29:26.548
Patton's trying to track
the vehicle they left in,

29:26.616 --> 29:29.751
but what have you two found
out about Edward Barrett?

29:29.819 --> 29:31.186
He had a rough go of it as a kid.

29:31.254 --> 29:33.032
He was abandoned as an
infant outside of a church.

29:33.056 --> 29:34.416
He entered the foster care system,

29:34.440 --> 29:35.924
shuttled around different homes.

29:35.992 --> 29:38.227
Take it he didn't grow
up to be a model citizen.

29:38.294 --> 29:41.597
No. Got a lengthy arrest record
for petty thefts, assault...

29:41.664 --> 29:43.532
Most recent of which landed him

29:43.600 --> 29:44.833
in prison for manslaughter.

29:44.901 --> 29:46.068
He served his full sentence,

29:46.135 --> 29:47.836
but he was released three years ago.

29:47.904 --> 29:49.864
- What's he been up to since?
- Nothing.

29:49.888 --> 29:52.107
Because he disappeared,
dropped entirely off the map.

29:52.175 --> 29:54.176
- Must've found something.
- Except we haven't.

29:54.244 --> 29:56.912
There's no driver's license,
no current address,

29:56.980 --> 29:59.281
no tax returns, no bank
accounts, nothing.

29:59.349 --> 30:01.049
It's like Eddie Barrett
didn't even exist.

30:01.117 --> 30:03.552
But he does.

30:03.620 --> 30:05.454
I exchanged words with
him at the hospital.

30:05.521 --> 30:07.089
And I let him walk away.

30:07.156 --> 30:08.556
We can't let Eddie disappear again.

30:08.591 --> 30:09.725
He's clearly skilled

30:09.792 --> 30:11.426
at not leaving a trail.

30:11.494 --> 30:12.928
Every second counts.

30:12.996 --> 30:14.529
All right, we'll focus

30:14.597 --> 30:16.437
on the mysterious gap
in his life after prison.

30:16.499 --> 30:18.934
Figure out how he's
connected to Sue-Ann.

30:19.002 --> 30:21.303
He's been living some
kind of life since prison.

30:21.371 --> 30:23.371
There's got to be a trail
that'll help us find him.

30:23.439 --> 30:25.079
All right. I'll check
back in with Patton.

30:25.107 --> 30:28.477
See if he's caught sight
of the car anywhere.

30:35.518 --> 30:37.386
Are you in or are you out?

30:37.453 --> 30:38.720
- Whoa. What is this?
- Ah.

30:38.788 --> 30:40.165
This is everything you need to do

30:40.189 --> 30:41.509
to fall in love with New Orleans.

30:41.533 --> 30:42.624
Mimi's in the Marigny.

30:42.692 --> 30:44.059
- Yes.
- Locals only.

30:44.127 --> 30:46.395
No tourists. And Paulie will make you

30:46.462 --> 30:48.096
the only Sazerac you need to know.

30:48.164 --> 30:50.232
He's not lying. It changed my life.

30:50.300 --> 30:52.501
- Seriously.
- What is this all about, Chris?

30:52.568 --> 30:56.338
It's about you finally letting
this city get under your skin.

30:57.807 --> 30:59.341
I struggle with that.

30:59.409 --> 31:01.410
I know you do.

31:01.477 --> 31:03.912
It's easier to cut bait and run
than to stay put and grow.

31:03.980 --> 31:05.780
Wow. Just put me in a
nutshell, why don't you.

31:05.804 --> 31:07.949
Uh, you put yourself there.

31:08.017 --> 31:10.085
Everything that has shifted

31:10.153 --> 31:12.988
in the squad room, you're
the only one who sees it.

31:13.056 --> 31:16.491
All we see is the same
agent we like working with.

31:16.559 --> 31:17.999
Kinda hard to turn it off, you know?

31:18.061 --> 31:19.361
I'm not saying you should.

31:20.763 --> 31:22.998
But try to remind yourself

31:23.066 --> 31:25.300
that there's more to life
than just catching bad guys.

31:27.036 --> 31:28.476
All right, you've got your daughter.

31:28.504 --> 31:30.839
- You got us.
- And...

31:30.907 --> 31:34.509
you get to start this new
life in this incredible place.

31:34.577 --> 31:37.045
But only if you open yourself up to it.

31:40.049 --> 31:42.050
Hannah?

31:42.118 --> 31:44.286
You okay?

31:44.354 --> 31:48.657
I know I didn't know him
as well as you guys did.

31:48.725 --> 31:50.892
But he left an impression.

31:50.960 --> 31:53.995
He went out of his way
for me. He didn't need to.

31:54.063 --> 31:56.064
Because that's who he was.

31:57.967 --> 31:59.968
I was able to follow Eddie's car

32:00.036 --> 32:01.737
on various cameras.

32:01.804 --> 32:04.506
Heading east, but I lost them
once they left outside the city.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.141
Well, it's a start.

32:06.209 --> 32:08.977
I'll update the BOLO
to focus the search.

32:09.045 --> 32:11.246
I already did. And I
set an algorithm loose

32:11.314 --> 32:13.482
across the traffic cam network

32:13.549 --> 32:15.016
to scan for his vehicle dimensions.

32:15.584 --> 32:16.985
Patton.

32:19.555 --> 32:21.089
I know you and Christopher were close.

32:21.157 --> 32:23.158
I failed him, man.

32:23.226 --> 32:25.227
What does that mean?

32:25.294 --> 32:28.029
Why didn't I look into Sue-Ann
when he first mentioned her?

32:28.097 --> 32:30.532
He died because I didn't do my job.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.134
Patton, stop.

32:34.447 --> 32:35.447
I said stop.

32:35.471 --> 32:36.705
Okay?

32:36.773 --> 32:39.241
I'm not gonna let you
do this to yourself.

32:39.308 --> 32:40.575
Pride, I could've...

32:40.643 --> 32:42.377
Could've what?

32:42.445 --> 32:45.013
There's a million variables
that led up to what happened.

32:45.081 --> 32:47.349
Okay? And nothing...

32:47.417 --> 32:49.818
nothing was gonna stop Chris
from going to that cabin.

32:51.421 --> 32:53.355
And he got shot.

32:53.423 --> 32:56.525
And he died.

32:56.592 --> 32:58.360
And you can't take responsibility

32:58.428 --> 32:59.561
for something you had

32:59.629 --> 33:01.363
no control over.

33:01.431 --> 33:03.532
You know that's not
making me feel any better.

33:03.599 --> 33:05.700
I'm not saying it to
make you feel better,

33:05.768 --> 33:08.236
but to keep you focused on...

33:08.304 --> 33:10.439
things you can control.

33:10.506 --> 33:13.041
Finding Eddie.

33:13.109 --> 33:14.443
Pride,

33:14.510 --> 33:16.545
the problem is all we got

33:16.612 --> 33:18.814
is a direction of him
leaving out of town.

33:19.381 --> 33:21.816
Eddie could be anywhere.

33:25.888 --> 33:27.823
The hunting cabin.

33:27.890 --> 33:29.324
What about it?

33:29.392 --> 33:30.826
Hannah was right.

33:30.893 --> 33:32.394
Eddie's a ghost,

33:32.462 --> 33:34.629
but he's been existing somewhere.

33:34.697 --> 33:36.932
He knew that cabin was there.

33:36.999 --> 33:38.900
He knew it was abandoned.

33:38.968 --> 33:40.735
Means he knows the area.

33:40.803 --> 33:42.137
Maybe he's from there.

33:42.205 --> 33:44.506
There's not a lot of camera
networks out in them sticks,

33:44.574 --> 33:45.894
but I'mma focus my program there.

33:45.918 --> 33:49.578
Yeah, we only need to catch
him on one to get closer.

33:49.645 --> 33:52.013
Ask and ye shall receive.

33:59.322 --> 34:01.256
Yeah, we got him.

34:01.324 --> 34:03.525
That was northbound on
Route 11, past Ozona.

34:03.593 --> 34:05.026
Okay. Keep tracking him.

34:05.094 --> 34:06.528
The rest of the team and I

34:06.596 --> 34:08.163
will head out in that direction now.

34:12.001 --> 34:13.668
Finish your eggs, darling.

34:15.237 --> 34:17.105
Need your strength.

Good for him.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.527
Edward Barrett.

34:38.594 --> 34:39.860
You're under arrest

34:39.929 --> 34:41.730
for the murder of a federal agent.

34:41.797 --> 34:44.498
Is that all, Agent Pride?

34:44.567 --> 34:47.168
And the murder of Cade Lasalle

34:47.235 --> 34:48.596
and the production and trafficking

34:48.620 --> 34:50.472
- of a schedule I narcotic.
- Whew.

34:50.540 --> 34:52.641
That's a mouthful, isn't it?

34:52.708 --> 34:55.143
You think this is funny?

34:55.210 --> 34:58.580
I think this is what
was always meant to be.

34:58.648 --> 35:00.649
You armed?

35:00.716 --> 35:02.083
I'm not.

35:02.151 --> 35:04.152
Would you prefer I was?

35:04.220 --> 35:06.421
- Maybe.
- Would give you the excuse

35:06.489 --> 35:08.056
you're looking for, wouldn't it?

35:09.926 --> 35:12.027
To get that ultimate
justice for your friend.

35:12.094 --> 35:14.296
You're welcome to make a sudden move.

35:17.133 --> 35:19.134
Forgot to ask if I was armed.

35:21.737 --> 35:24.105
You pull that trigger, you leave
this place in a body bag.

35:24.173 --> 35:25.941
Least you'll leave with me.

35:26.008 --> 35:27.542
I can get a clean shot, Pride.

35:27.610 --> 35:28.677
No.

35:28.744 --> 35:30.946
No one has to die today.

35:31.013 --> 35:35.417
But if we did, what a
glorious way to go.

35:35.484 --> 35:37.619
That's enough, Sue-Ann.

35:40.022 --> 35:42.157
Don't you worry now.

35:44.193 --> 35:46.795
This isn't how this ends.

36:02.697 --> 36:05.265
He'll be remembered for his...

36:05.333 --> 36:09.302
long and dedicated career as
a law enforcement officer,

36:09.370 --> 36:12.973
but we'll miss his big heart

36:13.040 --> 36:15.642
and his bright smile.

36:17.645 --> 36:20.680
None of us knows how long we'll be here,

36:20.748 --> 36:23.316
which is why Christopher

36:23.384 --> 36:26.820
spent every day in service...

36:27.822 --> 36:30.357
Service. In the service.

36:30.425 --> 36:32.359
In service.

36:36.697 --> 36:39.633
"Service of his fellow man".

36:39.700 --> 36:41.635
Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Hey, uh,

37:09.764 --> 37:11.231
yeah, I-I...

37:11.299 --> 37:13.400
I thought I was gonna be alone.

37:13.468 --> 37:16.303
You trying to sneak off to Belle
Chasse for your big promotion?

37:16.370 --> 37:17.971
Well, not sneaking off. Just...

37:18.039 --> 37:20.307
not wanting to make
a big deal out of it.

37:20.374 --> 37:22.008
Well, why not?

37:22.076 --> 37:25.545
You becoming the new SAC is a big deal.

37:25.613 --> 37:29.382
Guess I just don't really like
the thought of things changing.

37:29.450 --> 37:31.685
Well, nothing stays the same forever.

37:31.752 --> 37:33.887
If it did, wouldn't really be living.

37:33.955 --> 37:36.690
Yeah. Can't argue with that.

37:36.757 --> 37:39.693
I brought you a going-away present.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.562
Huh? Oh, come on, Chris,
you don't need to do that.

37:47.401 --> 37:49.503
- Is that...?
- Yeah, the same challenge coin

37:49.570 --> 37:52.506
you gave me when you
recruited me to join NCIS.

37:52.573 --> 37:54.875
Well, that's a long time ago.

37:54.942 --> 37:58.345
Can't forget those days when
it was just a two-man shop.

37:58.412 --> 38:00.947
Well, we built this place together.

38:01.015 --> 38:02.616
Yes, we did.

38:03.851 --> 38:05.652
Yes, we did.

38:07.255 --> 38:10.123
Thank you, Christopher.

38:10.191 --> 38:12.592
Don't you worry about this place.

38:12.660 --> 38:14.361
We'll be just fine.

38:14.428 --> 38:17.130
- You did your job.
- Mm.

38:17.198 --> 38:19.099
Proud of you, King.

38:58.906 --> 39:03.276
None of us knows how long we have here,

39:03.344 --> 39:05.178
which is why Christopher...

39:07.181 --> 39:11.718
...spent every day in
service of his fellow man.

39:13.754 --> 39:15.422
He treated all of us...

39:17.425 --> 39:20.360
...as he sought to be treated,

39:20.428 --> 39:22.596
with love and forgiveness.

39:26.067 --> 39:29.069
Special Agent Christopher Lasalle.

39:30.104 --> 39:32.105
Out of service.

39:35.543 --> 39:37.844
