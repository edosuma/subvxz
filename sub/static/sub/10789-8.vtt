WEBVTT

00:01.333 --> 00:03.625
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,
PACEY AND AUDREY BROKE UP,

00:03.625 --> 00:04.542
BUT JOEY AND AUDREY
ARE FIGHTING.

00:04.542 --> 00:06.542
YES, MAJORLY.

00:06.542 --> 00:08.500
DAWSON, YOU'VE GOT
TO CALL MORE OFTEN.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.166
HOLD ON A SECOND, OK?

00:10.166 --> 00:13.500
A: THE GUY HAS OBVIOUSLY
BEEN REALLY BUSY, OK?

00:13.500 --> 00:15.000
AND B: I MEAN...

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
SHE'S--SHE'S--
SHE'S EXAGGERATING,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.333
'CAUSE NOBODY'S BROKEN
ANY NAILS YET.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.333
IT'S MORE LIKE THEY'RE

00:20.333 --> 00:21.542
KEEPING THEIR DISTANCE
FROM EACH OTHER.

00:21.542 --> 00:24.083
THANK YOU.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.083
NO PROBLEM.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.000
YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THAT

00:26.000 --> 00:27.333
IF WE COULD GET THEM
IN THE SAME ROOM,

00:27.333 --> 00:29.291
THEY WOULD WORK
THINGS OUT JUST FINE.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.625
JOEY AND AUDREY?

00:30.625 --> 00:33.458
NO, PACEY AND AUDREY.
DUH.

00:33.458 --> 00:35.834
HERE WE GO.

00:35.834 --> 00:38.041
UH, NO--
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

00:38.041 --> 00:38.792
WHAT ABOUT
YOU, LOVE?

00:38.792 --> 00:40.083
CAN I GET
YOU ANYTHING?

00:40.083 --> 00:42.083
UH, NO, THANKS.
I CAN'T STAY THAT LONG.

00:42.083 --> 00:42.959
OH.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.291
OH, YEAH,
LET ME GUESS. UH...

00:45.291 --> 00:46.291
SHE'S NOT WORKING TONIGHT,

00:46.291 --> 00:47.417
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.834
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU STAY
AND HAVE A CHEESEBURGER?

00:49.834 --> 00:51.583
COME ON, DAWSON,
WE NEVER GET
TO SEE YOU ANYMORE.

00:51.583 --> 00:53.208
REALLY, I HAVE TO GO.

00:53.208 --> 00:54.083
DAWSON.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.542
I CAN'T, I SWEAR.
I GOT TO GET BACK.

00:56.542 --> 00:57.917
TODD THINKS I'M RUNNING
AN ERRAND RIGHT NOW,

00:57.917 --> 01:00.417
WHICH, TECHNICALLY...

01:00.417 --> 01:02.375
I AM.
WHAT IS THIS?

01:02.375 --> 01:03.333
IT'S A PRESENT.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.375
OH, YOU FEEL SO BAD
'CAUSE YOU DON'T CALL,

01:05.375 --> 01:06.208
YOU GOT TO GIVE
US PRESENTS.

01:06.208 --> 01:08.959
JUST OPEN IT.
IT'S NOT A GUILT OFFERING.

01:08.959 --> 01:09.542
I'D USE IT MYSELF
IF I COULD.

01:09.542 --> 01:11.625
OH, MY GOD!

01:11.625 --> 01:12.792
THESE ARE TICKETS
TO THE NO DOUBT CONCERT.

01:12.792 --> 01:15.375
DAWSON, THIS IS AMAZING.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.917
THERE'S LIKE
10 TICKETS IN HERE.

01:16.917 --> 01:18.041
ARE YOU SURE
THAT THIS IS OK?

01:18.041 --> 01:19.542
ABSOLUTELY.
TODD GOT THEM FOR FREE.

01:19.542 --> 01:20.750
I THINK HE KNOWS
THE BAND OR SOMETHING.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST, UH--

01:22.000 --> 01:24.417
DON'T GIVE THE MAN
A CHANCE TO CHANGE
HIS MIND THERE, ALL RIGHT?

01:24.417 --> 01:25.917
ANYWAY, GO, ENJOY IT.
HAVE FUN.

01:25.917 --> 01:27.583
AND, UH, LET ME KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS ONCE YOU GET

01:27.583 --> 01:29.458
PACEY AND AUDREY
IN THE SAME PLACE
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:29.458 --> 01:31.375
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:31.375 --> 01:33.708
THANKS, MAN.

01:38.583 --> 01:41.542
HEY.
HEY.

01:41.542 --> 01:42.917
I'M SORRY.
I WAS JUST, UH--

01:42.917 --> 01:46.000
OH, DON'T APOLOGIZE.
UM...ARE THEY--

01:46.000 --> 01:48.291
YEAH, THEY'RE BACK THERE.
JACK AND JEN...

01:48.291 --> 01:52.041
OH, GOOD. I WAS HOPING
FOR SOME COMPANY.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.208
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

01:55.208 --> 01:56.792
GREAT.

01:56.792 --> 01:58.250
REALLY GREAT.
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.708
GREAT.

02:00.708 --> 02:02.458
HEARD YOU AND AUDREY
HAD A FIGHT.

02:02.458 --> 02:03.917
YEAH...

02:03.917 --> 02:06.333
THOSE THINGS HAPPEN,
I GUESS.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.625
PEOPLE FIGHT.

02:11.083 --> 02:13.250
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU.

02:13.250 --> 02:16.083
DAWSON, THEY'RE
YOUR FRIENDS, TOO.

02:16.083 --> 02:17.458
YEAH, I KNOW.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.542
I JUST--I GOT TO GO.

02:19.542 --> 02:20.667
IT'S NICE SEEING YOU.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.417
YOU, TOO.

03:18.834 --> 03:21.500
NO DOUBT?
YEAH.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.125
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S
KIND OF A SCHLEP
TO WORCESTER,

03:23.125 --> 03:25.125
BUT THEY'RE TOTALLY
AMAZING LIVE,

03:25.125 --> 03:27.250
AND YOU DO
HAVE A CAR.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.333
WORCESTER?

03:28.333 --> 03:29.875
YEAH, IT'S ONLY LIKE
AN HOUR FROM HERE.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.875
I KNOW, I KNOW.
SO ON OUR DATE TONIGHT,

03:32.875 --> 03:34.625
YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE
YOU TO WORCESTER?

03:34.625 --> 03:36.708
CORRECT.

03:36.708 --> 03:37.667
AND WHEN WE GET THERE,

03:37.667 --> 03:39.625
ALL YOUR FRIENDS
WILL BE THERE.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.708
WELL,
NOT ALL OF THEM...

03:41.708 --> 03:43.375
OK, MOST.

03:44.875 --> 03:47.708
SO HOW IS THAT A DATE?

03:47.708 --> 03:51.708
WHAT MAKES IT A DATE
IS THAT I'M THERE...

03:51.708 --> 03:53.625
AND YOU'RE THERE.

03:53.625 --> 03:54.959
AND IF YOU PLAY
YOUR CARDS RIGHT,

03:54.959 --> 03:56.875
YOU MIGHT JUST GET
A KISS AT THE END
OF THE EVENING.

03:56.875 --> 03:57.333
A KISS?

03:59.667 --> 04:01.041
YEAH, THAT'S USUALLY
HOW THE WHOLE
FIRST-DATE THING

04:01.041 --> 04:03.708
TRADITIONALLY
SHAKES OUT.

04:03.708 --> 04:05.458
YOU KNOW,
YOU WALK ME
TO MY DOOR,

04:05.458 --> 04:07.166
YOU KISS ME,
YOU LEAVE.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.000
BUT I'VE ALREADY
GOTTEN A KISS.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.208
2, ACTUALLY.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.333
AND I DON'T KNOW
THAT I'M PREPARED

04:12.333 --> 04:14.834
TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY
TO WORCESTER FOR, WHAT?

04:14.834 --> 04:19.375
FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME
MEASLY LITTLE GOOD-NIGHT KISS?

04:19.375 --> 04:20.959
THERE IS ANOTHER
OPTION ON OFFER

04:20.959 --> 04:23.625
FOR THE END
OF THE EVENING.

04:23.625 --> 04:25.750
YES?

04:25.750 --> 04:27.834
YOU WALK ME
TO MY DOOR,

04:27.834 --> 04:30.208
WE SHAKE HANDS,

04:30.208 --> 04:32.875
AND I REIMBURSE YOU
FOR GAS MONEY.

04:32.875 --> 04:33.917
NICE.

04:33.917 --> 04:36.542
SO ARE YOU IN OR OUT?

04:36.542 --> 04:37.834
I'M IN.

04:38.959 --> 04:39.959
Todd: IS IT JUST ME,

04:39.959 --> 04:43.083
OR, UH, IS THERE
SOMETHING WEIRD
ABOUT THIS DAY?

04:43.083 --> 04:46.458
UM, THE FACT THAT
WE FINISHED ALL OUR
DAY WORK BEFORE LUNCH,

04:46.458 --> 04:47.625
AND NOW WE'RE JUST
PAYING ALL THESE PEOPLE

04:47.625 --> 04:50.208
TO STAND AROUND DOING NOTHING
UNTIL THE SUN SETS?

04:50.208 --> 04:51.917
OH, THERE ISN'T
SOMEPLACE YOU'D
RATHER BE, IS THERE?

04:51.917 --> 04:53.166
NO, BUT LOOK AROUND.

04:53.166 --> 04:54.917
EVERYBODY'S EXHAUSTED,
INCLUDING YOURSELF.

04:54.917 --> 04:57.041
ALL THESE NIGHT SHOOTS
HAVE FINALLY CAUGHT UP
WITH US.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.792
OH, I SEE.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.917
SO YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD
GIVE UP 2 NIGHT EXTERIORS
I REALLY NEED

05:01.917 --> 05:04.458
SO THE CREW CAN KNOCK OFF
4 HOURS EARLY ON A FRIDAY?

05:04.458 --> 05:07.458
4 HOURS, 35 MINUTES,
WOULD BE EVEN BETTER.

05:07.458 --> 05:08.792
THERE'S A BLOODY POOL GOING?

05:08.792 --> 05:09.166
BIG ONE.

05:09.166 --> 05:09.959
THINK ABOUT IT.

05:09.959 --> 05:10.959
I MEAN, HONESTLY,

05:10.959 --> 05:13.083
YOU WRAP
EARLY TONIGHT,

05:13.083 --> 05:14.959
EVERYBODY COMES IN
MONDAY COMPLETELY
REFRESHED.

05:14.959 --> 05:17.625
EVERYONE, INCLUDING YOU?

05:17.625 --> 05:18.792
SURE.

05:18.792 --> 05:19.792
AND NATASHA?
SURE.

05:19.792 --> 05:22.291
I GET IT.

05:22.291 --> 05:23.959
SO ALL THIS
FRIEND-TO-THE-CREW STUFF

05:23.959 --> 05:25.375
WAS JUST AN EXCUSE
TO GET THE NIGHT OFF

05:25.375 --> 05:26.875
SO YOU COULD TAKE HER
TO THAT CONCERT?

05:26.875 --> 05:27.792
I'LL SPLIT
THE MONEY WITH YOU.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.583
(LAUGHS)

05:30.583 --> 05:33.291
NOT NECESSARY.
I ALREADY WON 500

05:33.291 --> 05:36.208
IN THE WHEN-WILL-
DAWSON-AND-NATASHA-START-
SHAGGING-AGAIN POOL.

05:38.417 --> 05:38.917
HERE.
WHAT ARE THESE?

05:38.917 --> 05:40.500
MY TICKETS.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.875
THEY'RE MUCH BETTER THAN
THE ONES I GAVE YOU.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.583
AND I THINK THERE'S SOME
BACKSTAGE PASS IN THERE, TOO.

05:44.583 --> 05:45.667
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

05:45.667 --> 05:47.375
BETWEEN YOU AND ME?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.625
I'M OLD...

05:51.625 --> 05:53.000
AND TIRED,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.792
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO WRAP
4 HOURS AND 35 MINUTES EARLY,

05:55.792 --> 05:59.834
ALL I WANT TO DO IS GO HOME
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

05:59.834 --> 06:02.834
GO GET 'EM, TIGER.

06:09.083 --> 06:12.208
SO, YOU'RE COMING, RIGHT?
I MEAN, IF THE BAND CAN

06:12.208 --> 06:15.375
OVERCOME THEIR COMPLICATED
ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENTS
AND STILL BE FRIENDS,

06:15.375 --> 06:18.417
THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO
IS ALL GET ALONG FOR ONE NIGHT.

06:18.417 --> 06:20.875
ALL RIGHT, I AM
WILLING TO GRANT

06:20.875 --> 06:23.208
THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN
KARMIC APPROPRIATENESS

06:23.208 --> 06:24.083
TO SEEING ONE'S
EX-BOYFRIEND

06:24.083 --> 06:26.542
FOR THE FIRST TIME AT
A NO DOUBT CONCERT.

06:26.542 --> 06:26.959
YOU'RE BENDING.

06:26.959 --> 06:29.542
I'M NOT BENDING.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.959
OH, COME ON,
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.667
EMPOWERED FEMALE.
INCREDIBLE FASHION SENSE.

06:36.542 --> 06:39.625
I SUPPOSE MOJO JOJO
WILL BE ATTENDING.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.208
OH, COME ON,
IF YOU CAN--

06:41.208 --> 06:42.625
IF YOU CAN BE WITH HER IN THAT
TINY LITTLE DORM ROOM OF YOURS,

06:42.625 --> 06:46.792
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
JUST FINE IN A CROWD
OF 14,000 STRANGERS.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.708
SO SHE'S BRINGING
THAT GUY, RIGHT?

06:49.708 --> 06:51.542
MM-HMM,

06:51.542 --> 06:53.250
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
TO SIT NEXT TO THEM.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.250
WE'RE USING THE GAYS
AS A BARRIER

06:55.250 --> 06:57.583
BETWEEN THE BREEDERS
AND THE BITTER, SINGLE GIRLS.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.291
SO, WHAT?

06:59.291 --> 07:01.542
ARE THEY, LIKE,
DATING NOW?

07:01.542 --> 07:02.750
LOOK AT YOU.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.083
YOU WANT THE GOSSIP
SO BAD IT'S KILLING YOU.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.500
I DON'T WANT THE GOSSIP.
I JUST...I DON'T KNOW--

07:07.500 --> 07:10.875
I WANT TO HEAR THAT
SHE HAS A PIMPLE OR SOMETHING.

07:10.875 --> 07:14.250
I WANT THERE TO BE
ONE TINY LITTLE CHINK
IN HER ARMOR OF PERFECTION.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.041
I MEAN, HAS THAT GIRL
EVER MADE A MISTAKE? EVER?

07:17.041 --> 07:19.250
YEAH, ACTUALLY,

07:19.250 --> 07:20.417
THE SAME ONE
THAT YOU DID.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.458
SHE DUMPED PACEY.

07:22.458 --> 07:23.917
THAT'S FUNNY.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.208
YOU KNOW, THE WAY
I ALWAYS HEARD IT,
HE DUMPED HER.

07:26.208 --> 07:27.208
OH, WHATEVER.

07:27.208 --> 07:29.333
WHO KNOWS? WHO CARES?

07:29.333 --> 07:32.000
HONESTLY,
THE IMPORTANT THING IS

07:32.000 --> 07:34.291
IS THAT THEY'RE
STILL FRIENDS...

07:34.291 --> 07:35.583
LIKE US.

07:37.417 --> 07:38.417
DO YOU MEAN THAT?

07:38.417 --> 07:40.000
YES, I DO.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.250
(SIGHS)

07:42.250 --> 07:43.542
SO YOU COMING?

07:44.750 --> 07:46.834
I'M COMING.
YAY!

07:46.834 --> 07:47.583
I'M SO GLAD.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.458
YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO REGRET THIS.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.166
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE NIGHT.

07:51.166 --> 07:51.875
OH, MY GOD.
I AM SO SORRY.

07:51.875 --> 07:52.917
HI.

07:52.917 --> 07:55.208
HI. HI.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.250
HI.
HEY.

07:57.250 --> 07:58.458
I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST...

07:58.458 --> 08:00.792
NOT LOOKING
WHERE I WAS GOING.

08:00.792 --> 08:02.583
YEAH, YOU SEEMED
PRETTY EXCITED THERE.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.208
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE
ACTUALLY GOING TO
A NO DOUBT CONCERT TONIGHT.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.708
COOL.

08:07.792 --> 08:08.667
WELL, HAVE FUN.

08:10.041 --> 08:13.083
WELL, SEE 'YA.

08:15.083 --> 08:19.583
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO PRETEND THAT NOTHING
HAPPENED BETWEEN US, AND...

08:19.583 --> 08:22.041
AND I ALSO DON'T
WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL
OUT OF THE...

08:22.041 --> 08:24.708
NOTHING THAT DID
HAPPEN BETWEEN US. UM...

08:26.125 --> 08:28.000
HERE, IF YOU WANT TO COME.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.750
YOU'RE GIVING ME
A TICKET TO THE NO DOUBT
CONCERT?

08:29.750 --> 08:31.291
YEAH, I MEAN,
JACK'S GOING, AND DAVID,

08:31.291 --> 08:32.417
AND ALL OF US, REALLY,

08:32.417 --> 08:35.417
SO IT'S--IT'S NOT LIKE A DATE.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.500
NO, I DIDN'T
THINK IT WAS.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.875
GREAT. GREAT.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.041
WELL, UM...

08:43.041 --> 08:44.417
LIKE I SAID,
COME IF YOU WANT.

08:44.417 --> 08:46.875
ALL RIGHT,
I'M PICKING YOU UP
AT 7:00. NO BAILING, OK?

08:54.333 --> 08:56.708
SO, WERE YOU EVER GOING
TO CALL ME BACK?

08:56.708 --> 08:58.333
I THINK THAT THE ANSWER
TO THAT

08:58.333 --> 09:00.083
WOULD BE
FAIRLY OBVIOUS.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.208
YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

09:11.208 --> 09:14.291
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
WE WERE GREAT, YOU KNOW?

09:14.291 --> 09:17.083
AND WE'LL PROBABLY
WIN SOME SORT OF AWARD
FOR MORAL FORTITUDE

09:17.083 --> 09:19.125
AND THE PROPER USE
OF BIRTH CONTROL.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.458
I DON'T SEE WHAT
THE BIG DEAL IS HERE.

09:20.458 --> 09:21.542
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S
MY GIRLFRIEND, OK?

09:21.542 --> 09:23.583
YEAH? WELL, NEITHER AM I.

09:23.583 --> 09:25.792
I'M JUST...

09:25.792 --> 09:26.208
I'M AN IDIOT.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.417
OH, SO, WHAT?

09:28.417 --> 09:29.959
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO PRETEND LIKE
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED?

09:29.959 --> 09:31.333
YES,

09:31.333 --> 09:33.125
AND UNLESS YOU WANT
ME TO KILL YOU,

09:33.125 --> 09:34.959
YOU WILL, TOO.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.750
Man: TICKETS.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.458
DISGUSTING, ISN'T IT?

09:56.458 --> 09:57.083
WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T KEEP
THEIR HANDS OFF EACH OTHER?

09:57.083 --> 09:58.083
YEAH.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.834
JUST, UH, YEAH.

10:01.750 --> 10:02.917
TICKETS.

10:02.917 --> 10:03.917
TICKETS, PLEASE.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.208
I HAVE THEM. I DO.

10:05.208 --> 10:06.250
I MUST HAVE THEM.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.834
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

10:07.834 --> 10:08.750
NO. I WAS LEAVING,

10:08.750 --> 10:11.625
I PUT THEM IN
MY COAT POCKET, AND...

10:12.250 --> 10:14.792
I WORE MY OTHER COAT.

10:14.792 --> 10:16.417
A FASHION TRAGEDY. NEXT.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.208
CRAP!
TICKETS.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.333
OK, BUT ARE YOU SURE
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE THEM
IN THE CAR OR SOMETHING?

10:19.333 --> 10:21.875
YES, I'M POSITIVE.
THEY'RE...

10:21.875 --> 10:22.917
THEY'RE IN MY OTHER COAT,

10:22.917 --> 10:25.083
WHICH IS SITTING ON MY BED
BACK IN MY DORM ROOM.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.542
WELL, DON'T PANIC
OR ANYTHING.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.959
WE'LL JUST
GO BACK FOR THEM.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.333
YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING
TO DRIVE MORE?

10:29.333 --> 10:30.458
HEY, YOU'RE
PAYING FOR GAS.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.000
NO, IT'LL TAKE US AN HOUR
JUST TO WALK BACK TO THE CAR.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.875
SO?

10:34.875 --> 10:35.917
SO WITH THAT,
PLUS TRAFFIC,

10:35.917 --> 10:37.083
THEY'LL BE ON
THEIR THIRD ENCORE

10:37.083 --> 10:38.125
BY THE TIME WE GET BACK.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.166
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

10:39.166 --> 10:41.125
YOU JUST WANT TO FORGET
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING?

10:41.125 --> 10:42.333
NO.

10:42.333 --> 10:43.458
I DON'T KNOW.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.917
LOOK, YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO TO THIS CONCERT,
DON'T YOU?

10:45.917 --> 10:48.083
YES.

10:48.083 --> 10:51.917
I'M A DORKY FAN, I ADMIT IT,
BUT I LOVE THIS BAND.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.750
THEN WE'RE GOING.

10:55.375 --> 10:56.458
EDDIE, IT'S GOING
TO TAKE US--

10:56.458 --> 10:57.458
SILENCE...

10:57.458 --> 10:59.291
BEFORE I COME
TO MY SENSES
AND CHANGE MY MIND.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.583
COME ON.

11:10.291 --> 11:14.000
ARE YOU GUYS
GOING OR WHAT?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.291
SORRY. SO TACKY
WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T
KEEP THEIR HANDS

11:16.291 --> 11:16.834
OFF EACH OTHER
IN PUBLIC.

11:16.834 --> 11:18.417
SORRY.
TICKETS, PLEASE.

11:18.417 --> 11:19.375
HERE YOU GO.

11:19.375 --> 11:20.500
WRONG NIGHT, ROMEO.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.000
EXCUSE ME?
THESE ARE FOR SATURDAY.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.458
NO, THEY CAN'T BE.
THESE ARE--CRAP.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.458
GOOD SEATS, TOO.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.417
REALLY WOULD HAVE
IMPRESSED YOUR
GIRLFRIEND HERE.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.125
NEXT!

11:29.125 --> 11:30.125
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS.

11:30.125 --> 11:31.500
THIS IS--I--

11:31.500 --> 11:32.542
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER
THAN TO TRUST TODD.

11:32.542 --> 11:33.625
THE GUY PROBABLY THINKS
TODAY IS SATURDAY.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.583
WE STILL HAVE
THE BACKSTAGE PASSES
THOUGH, DON'T WE?

11:35.583 --> 11:36.750
YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T
GET IN WITH THOSE.
WE NEED THE TICKETS.

11:36.750 --> 11:37.834
UH, HOLD ON.

11:37.834 --> 11:38.959
HUMOR ME.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.333
I HAVE SPECIAL SKILLS
IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.667
Jen: YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO REGRET THIS, I SWEAR.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.542
YOU'RE HERE,
YOU'RE NOT IN A SUIT.

11:45.542 --> 11:48.333
THIS IS GOOD.
THIS IS VERY, VERY GOOD.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.583
WHERE IS EVERYBODY ELSE?

11:49.583 --> 11:51.208
THEY'RE AT
THE CONCESSION STAND.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.542
JACK AND EMMA,
AND, UH...

11:53.542 --> 11:56.375
THE GUY
AND THE GUY'S FRIEND.

11:56.375 --> 11:57.458
YEAH, WELL,
HIS NAME IS DAVID,

11:57.458 --> 11:58.083
WHICH YOU MIGHT
WANT TO REMEMBER.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.083
I THINK
HE'S GOING TO STICK.

12:00.083 --> 12:01.959
WHAT, YOU POSSES
THE PSYCHIC ABILITY

12:01.959 --> 12:03.375
TO SEE INTO THE FUTURE
OF RELATIONSHIPS NOW?

12:03.375 --> 12:05.875
YES, JUST NOT MY OWN.

12:05.875 --> 12:06.959
AH.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.333
SO WHERE ARE
THESE SEATS ANYWAY?

12:08.333 --> 12:09.208
IS THAT WHERE
WE'RE GOING NOW?

12:09.208 --> 12:10.208
YEAH.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.625
THEY'RE--

12:11.625 --> 12:12.500
THEY'RE THAT WAY.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.333
I MEAN, THEY'RE IN THAT
GENERAL DIRECTION.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.083
COOL.
OK, UM...

12:18.000 --> 12:21.625
AND WHEN YOU GO IN THAT
GENERAL DIRECTION...

12:21.625 --> 12:23.667
YES?

12:23.667 --> 12:25.667
THERE'S--THERE'S GOING
TO BE SOMEBODY THERE

12:25.667 --> 12:27.875
WHO WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

12:31.959 --> 12:32.875
OH, COME ON.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.542
YOU DID NOT
JUST DO THIS TO ME.

12:34.542 --> 12:37.291
YEAH, WE DID,
BUT OUT OF LOVE.

12:37.291 --> 12:40.083
TRUST ME, WHEN YOU
LOOK BACK ON THIS EVENT
IN A FEW YEARS,

12:40.083 --> 12:41.625
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
VERY GRATEFUL,

12:41.625 --> 12:43.083
BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE
DONE THE MATURE THING.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.125
(SIGHS)

12:45.125 --> 12:47.208
COME ON.

12:47.208 --> 12:50.166
GO. YOU KNOW
YOU WANT TO.

13:09.458 --> 13:10.959
EXCUSE ME.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.417
SURPRISE.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.125
HEY.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.375
I DID CALL YOU, YOU KNOW.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.333
I KNOW.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.792
AT LEAST I FIGURED THAT
I SHOULDN'T TALK TO YOU

13:21.792 --> 13:22.291
UNTIL I HATED YOU
A LITTLE LESS.

13:22.291 --> 13:25.041
OH, WELL...

13:25.041 --> 13:25.458
HOW'S THAT GOING FOR YOU?

13:25.458 --> 13:27.542
IT'S GOING, YEAH.

13:27.542 --> 13:29.917
THE PROBLEM IS NOW
I KIND OF HATE MYSELF,
BUT, UH...

13:33.708 --> 13:34.959
AUDREY,
CAN WE GO TALK A WALK?

13:34.959 --> 13:37.208
MAYBE TALK SOMEPLACE
THAT'S A LITTLE QUIETER

13:37.208 --> 13:41.667
AND SLIGHTLY MORE PRIVATE
BEFORE ALL THE MADNESS STARTS?

13:41.667 --> 13:43.000
(CHUCKLES)

13:43.000 --> 13:44.917
YOU REALLY ARE
AN OLD MAN, AREN'T YOU?

13:46.417 --> 13:47.542
SURE.

13:47.542 --> 13:48.000
OK.

13:50.166 --> 13:51.417
EXCUSE US.

13:51.417 --> 13:52.667
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU,

13:52.667 --> 13:55.166
I'M NOT TRYING
TO SNEAK BACKSTAGE, OK?

13:55.166 --> 13:57.166
I'M NOT SOME KIND OF
DERANGED FAN.

13:57.166 --> 13:57.917
I JUST NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE WHO WORKS HERE.

13:57.917 --> 14:01.041
IS IT ME?
NO, VERY FUNNY, THOUGH.

14:01.041 --> 14:01.917
GOOD-BYE.

14:01.917 --> 14:03.542
NO, I JUST NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE FOR--

14:09.125 --> 14:11.000
JUST TO LET YOU
KNOW, WE CAN STOP
THIS AT ANY POINT.

14:11.000 --> 14:11.542
BUT IT'S GOING SO WELL.

14:11.542 --> 14:14.208
OH, I CAN SEE THAT.

14:14.208 --> 14:15.875
LOOK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO HARASS
SOME POOR GUY

14:15.875 --> 14:17.208
JUST TO IMPRESS ME.

14:17.208 --> 14:18.708
THIS WHOLE THING IS
MY FAULT, ANYWAY.

14:18.708 --> 14:22.166
BELIEVE ME, IF THIS WORKS,
YOU WILL NOT BE IMPRESSED.

14:23.041 --> 14:25.792
HEY, MORE PEOPLE.
THIS IS GOOD.

14:25.792 --> 14:28.250
UH, THIS IS GOOD.
I'M GONNA GO ASK THEM--

14:28.250 --> 14:30.041
OH, NO.
NO, YOU'RE NOT!

14:30.750 --> 14:33.333
OK, THIS IS
TOTALLY GONNA WORK,

14:33.333 --> 14:34.917
BUT YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.
IT'LL WORK BETTER

14:34.917 --> 14:37.834
IF YOU PRETEND YOU'RE LIKE
MY BROTHER OR SOMETHING.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.417
YOU DID NOT
JUST DO THAT.

14:39.417 --> 14:41.041
DO YOU WANT TO GET
INTO THIS THING OR NOT?

14:41.041 --> 14:42.083
I'D BE PERFECTLY HAPPY
IF WE WENT RIGHT BACK
TO THE CAR--

14:42.083 --> 14:44.000
HEY!
IT'S OUR NIGHT OFF.
WE'RE GOING.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.834
HI.

14:52.834 --> 14:54.375
HI.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.458
NOT THAT I CARE--

14:55.458 --> 14:57.208
SHH! HE'LL SEE US.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.208
WHO?

15:06.542 --> 15:08.125
THAT'S THE GUY
FROM THE MOVIE SET.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.458
YES.

15:10.375 --> 15:11.667
AND THE GUY
FROM THE MOVIE SET

15:11.667 --> 15:12.458
IS THE FRIEND
WHO GAVE YOU THE TICKETS.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.542
YEAH, KIND OF.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.542
AND NOW WE'RE HIDING.
WHY?

15:16.542 --> 15:19.750
I DON'T KNOW.
GUT INSTINCT.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.333
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
COME ON.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.750
COME ON.
JUST WAIT TILL--

15:23.750 --> 15:26.667
NO, NO, COME ON,
COME ON!

15:29.333 --> 15:31.875
YEAH, IF, UH...

15:31.875 --> 15:35.417
THAT'S TONIGHT'S LIST,
WE SHOULD BE ON IT.

15:38.750 --> 15:42.041
CARR, TODD CARR,
DAMAGE, INC.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.625
BIG VIDEO DIRECTOR.

15:43.625 --> 15:46.875
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
PROBABLY SPELLED
HIS NAME WITH A "K."

15:49.917 --> 15:51.959
AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME
TO TELL YOU THIS, LADY,

15:51.959 --> 15:53.750
IF YOU'RE NOT THE LIST,
YOU'RE NOT ON THE LIST.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.917
WELL, ISN'T THERE
SOME OTHER LIST?

15:55.917 --> 15:57.083
NOT TONIGHT
THERE'S NOT.

15:57.083 --> 15:58.166
OH, WELL, MAYBE
THEY MESSED UP

15:58.166 --> 15:59.333
AND PUT US
ON TOMORROW'S LIST.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.125
I MEAN, THAT COULD HAPPEN,
THAT'S POSSIBLE RIGHT?

16:01.125 --> 16:02.417
I MEAN, WHY ELSE
WOULD WE HAVE
THESE BACKSTAGE PASSES?

16:02.417 --> 16:03.333
NOT MY PROBLEM.

16:03.333 --> 16:03.917
WELL--UGH!

16:03.917 --> 16:05.417
CAN'T WE WORK
THIS OUT?

16:05.417 --> 16:09.875
AFRAID NOT.

16:09.875 --> 16:12.583
I DIDN'T KNOW
AUDREY WAS INVOLVED
WITH ANYBODY.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.208
WELL,
THEY JUST BROKE UP,

16:14.208 --> 16:16.375
WHICH IS WHY I THINK
SHE'S BEEN SO CRAZY
RECENTLY.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.000
I THINK THAT
SHE'S JUST HAVING
A HARD TIME DEALING.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.291
YEAH, THINGS LIKE
THAT CAN BE TOUGH.

16:21.291 --> 16:21.792
YOU WANT ANYTHING?
NO, I'M FINE.

16:21.792 --> 16:22.792
JUST ONE COKE,
THANKS.

16:22.792 --> 16:24.875
YOU KNOW,
TO BE HONEST,

16:24.875 --> 16:26.667
SHE SEEMED KIND OF
SINGLE TO ME.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.750
WHY, CAUSE OF THAT
NIGHT AT THAT PARTY?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.750
YEAH, THAT,
AND OTHER THINGS.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.834
YOU KNOW, SHE JUST
GOT CONFUSED.

16:32.834 --> 16:35.166
IT HAPPENS TO
THE BEST OF US.

16:35.166 --> 16:37.041
YEAH, IT DOES.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.708
YOU KNOW, FOR TWO PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T SEEING EACH OTHER,

16:42.708 --> 16:45.834
WE END UP ALONE
AN AWFUL LOT OF THE TIME.

16:45.834 --> 16:46.959
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING

16:46.959 --> 16:48.500
MAYBE WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THAT.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.041
NO, I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK THAT
THAT IS NECESSARY.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.166
NO,
'CAUSE I FEEL BAD,

16:52.166 --> 16:53.750
AND I DON'T WANT
TO END UP
FEELING WORSE.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.583
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU HAVE THE WRONG
IMPRESSION OF ME.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.750
NO. NO, I MEAN,
THERE WAS NO ROOM
FOR AMBIGUITY

16:58.750 --> 17:00.000
WHEN YOU REFUSED
TO KISS ME, SO--

17:00.000 --> 17:02.500
OK, OK, HOLD ON.
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK THAT I'M

17:02.500 --> 17:03.708
PLAYING GAMES WITH
YOU OR SOMETHING.

17:03.708 --> 17:04.916
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT?

17:04.916 --> 17:07.083
NO, I'M NOT.
I'M ACTUALLY...

17:07.083 --> 17:09.333
INTERESTED
IN SOMEBODY ELSE.

17:10.791 --> 17:11.250
OH.

17:15.290 --> 17:16.375
I SEE,
SO, ALL THAT STUFF

17:16.375 --> 17:19.165
ABOUT NOT BEING
READY TO DATE...

17:19.165 --> 17:20.834
JUST APPLIED TO ME.

17:20.834 --> 17:21.834
NO, JEN,
I MEANT ALL THAT.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.125
I DID. I'M NOT READY
TO BE SERIOUS
WITH SOMEBODY.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.791
THIS OTHER GIRL...

17:26.708 --> 17:28.667
KIND OF TOOK ME
BY SURPRISE.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.041
IT JUST KIND OF
HAPPENED. I MEAN,

17:30.041 --> 17:30.959
WE WERE AT THE WRONG
PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME,
THINGS ESCALATED.

17:30.959 --> 17:33.375
DID YOU SLEEP
WITH THIS GIRL?

17:35.875 --> 17:38.875
WOW, SO,
SLEEPING WITH PEOPLE

17:38.875 --> 17:40.750
DOESN'T VIOLATE
YOUR MORAL CODE,

17:40.750 --> 17:42.792
BUT DATING THEM DOES.

17:42.792 --> 17:44.208
JEN, LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU--

17:44.208 --> 17:45.959
NO, YOU HAVE.
REALLY WELL, TOO.

17:45.959 --> 17:49.000
AND FOR
FUTURE REFERENCE,

17:49.000 --> 17:50.375
WHEN THINGS ESCALATE
WITH A GIRL,

17:50.375 --> 17:52.750
THAT GENERALLY MEANS
THAT SHE'S
INTERESTED IN YOU.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.000
YEAH, EXCEPT
WHEN SHE'S KIND OF
MESSED UP,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.208
ALREADY HAS
A BOYFRIEND.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.875
JEN, I THINK
YOU'RE GREAT.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.041
I THINK YOU'RE
A GREAT PERSON.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.000
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A VERY GOOD FRIEND

18:03.000 --> 18:04.750
TO AUDREY,
TO EVERYBODY.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.291
WHAT...

18:07.500 --> 18:09.583
WHAT DOES AUDREY HAVE...

18:11.792 --> 18:16.375
OH, MY GOD. IT WAS AUDREY.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.250
YOU SLEPT WITH AUDREY.

18:17.250 --> 18:20.708
IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK,
ALL RIGHT, SHE--

18:21.500 --> 18:24.166
I MESSED UP.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.917
SO, THANK YOU

18:33.917 --> 18:34.291
FOR THE T-SHIRT.

18:36.959 --> 18:38.875
WELL, IT IS
THE LEAST I CAN DO

18:38.875 --> 18:40.083
FOR ACTING
LIKE A SWINE.

18:40.083 --> 18:43.708
YOU WEREN'T A SWINE.
YOU WERE JUST...

18:43.708 --> 18:45.583
A GUY.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.208
I'D LIKE TO THINK
THAT I GET GRADED

18:47.208 --> 18:48.458
ON A DIFFERENT CURVE
THAN THAT.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.959
PERHAPS
THE HUMAN BEING ONE.

18:50.959 --> 18:53.667
IT'S NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO MAKE ME HAPPY, PACEY.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.041
IT'S MINE.

18:55.041 --> 18:57.166
WELL, LET'S BE HONEST.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOING

18:57.166 --> 18:59.250
SUCH A BANG-UP JOB OF
THAT LATELY, AUDREY.

18:59.250 --> 19:02.083
I MISS YOU, OK?

19:02.792 --> 19:05.208
I MISS YOU, TOO.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.125
AND HONESTLY,
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH MORE

19:09.125 --> 19:11.917
OF THIS BEING DOWN
ON YOURSELF STUFF
I CAN TAKE.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.583
YEAH, WELL, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

19:14.583 --> 19:16.708
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
TO MAKE YOU FEEL
BETTER, AREN'T I?

19:16.708 --> 19:18.250
BY FORCE,
IF NECESSARY.

19:18.250 --> 19:21.708
AAH! PACEY,
NO ROUGH-HOUSING
IN PUBLIC!

19:21.708 --> 19:23.291
WHO'S THE OLD MAN
NOW, HUH?

19:23.291 --> 19:26.041
SERIOUSLY,
WE MIGHT BE LOST.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.792
I THINK WE SHOULD'VE
LEFT LIKE A TRAIL
OF POPCORN OR SOMETHING.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.041
WE CAN'T BE LOST.
IT'S AN ARENA.

19:30.041 --> 19:32.542
SPEAKING OF,
THERE'S JEN. JEN!

19:32.542 --> 19:34.500
JEN!

19:34.500 --> 19:36.708
HEY. SO,
IS IT STARTING?

19:36.708 --> 19:39.041
YEAH, ALMOST.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.250
WELL, EXCELLENT.
LET'S GET IN THERE,

19:40.250 --> 19:42.625
BECAUSE I PERSONALLY
DO NOT WANT TO MISS

19:42.625 --> 19:45.875
A SINGLE SOLITARY
SECOND OF...

19:45.875 --> 19:47.875
NO DOUBT.
IT'S ON THE T-SHIRT.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.792
RIGHT.
NO DOUBT IT IS.
SO, LET'S GO.

19:49.792 --> 19:52.875
YOU KNOW, WOULD YOU MIND
GOING IN AHEAD,

19:52.875 --> 19:54.750
AND AUDREY AND I
ARE JUST GONNA
HAVE A LITTLE CHAT?

19:54.750 --> 19:57.375
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
GIRL TIME. I'LL
SEE YOU IN THERE.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.417
WHAT?

20:02.417 --> 20:04.250
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU
THAT I KNOW

20:04.250 --> 20:06.291
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND C.J.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.041
JEN...

20:12.041 --> 20:13.625
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
YOU LIKED HIM SO MUCH.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.417
LIKE, I THOUGHT
THAT YOU DID, BUT I--

20:15.417 --> 20:16.375
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.417
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I KNOW.

20:22.875 --> 20:25.834
JEN, NO, SERIOUSLY, WAIT.

20:25.834 --> 20:27.083
LET'S--LET'S DO
TALK ABOUT IT.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.166
I DON'T KNOW, YELL AT ME,
DO SOMETHING, JUST--

20:28.166 --> 20:30.166
I DESERVE IT.
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.458
I'M SORRY.
IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

20:32.458 --> 20:35.417
YEAH,
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

20:35.917 --> 20:39.083
SO, THEN YELL AT ME.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.000
I DON'T WANT TO
YELL AT YOU.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.625
I DON'T
HAVE IT IN ME
TO YELL AT YOU.

20:43.625 --> 20:44.542
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
HOLDING BACK LATELY

20:44.542 --> 20:47.125
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY
HAD SOME SYMPATHY
FOR YOU.

20:47.125 --> 20:51.875
I THOUGHT, "AUDREY--
SHE'S JUST CONFUSED.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.542
SHE'S JUST MESSED
UP," BUT YOU'RE NOT.

20:54.542 --> 20:55.959
YOU'RE JUST SAD.

21:08.542 --> 21:11.166
(BAND PLAYING HELLA GOOD)

22:29.500 --> 22:32.959
WOULDN'T NOW BE
A GOOD TIME TO ADMIT
THAT WE'RE LOST?

22:32.959 --> 22:35.625
WE'RE NOT LOST.

22:35.625 --> 22:38.708
EDDIE, WE SEEM
TO BE MOVING AWAY
FROM THE MUSIC.

22:38.708 --> 22:41.125
OH, SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

22:41.125 --> 22:43.583
WELL, IS THERE
A REASON I SHOULD?

22:43.583 --> 22:45.041
HAVE YOU DONE
ANYTHING
TO DEMONSTRATE

22:45.041 --> 22:45.834
THAT YOU'RE
IN THE LEAST
TRUSTWORTHY?

22:45.834 --> 22:49.750
WOW. TRUST ISSUES.

22:49.750 --> 22:50.834
I GUESS WE ARE LEARNING

22:50.834 --> 22:52.667
A FEW THINGS ABOUT
EACH OTHER TONIGHT, HUH?

22:52.667 --> 22:54.667
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE LEARNING
THINGS ABOUT ME.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.375
OK, WAIT HERE.

22:58.375 --> 23:01.250
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING ME ALONE
IN THIS PLACE.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.083
I'M PRETTY SURE
FREDDY KRUEGER'S
SECOND HOME

23:02.083 --> 23:03.375
IS RIGHT AROUND
THE CORNER.

23:03.375 --> 23:08.125
2 SECONDS, OK?
2 SECONDS, I SWEAR.

23:09.625 --> 23:10.959
I'M SORRY, JO,
BUT YOU'RE
JUST GONNA HAVE TO

23:10.959 --> 23:13.500
TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.291
FINE.

23:15.750 --> 23:17.625
OK.

23:47.041 --> 23:49.208
OK. WE'RE ALL SET.

23:49.208 --> 23:51.208
SO YOU GONNA
TELL ME WHAT'S
GOING ON NOW?

23:51.208 --> 23:52.917
OK, YOU KIDS
READY TO GO?

23:52.917 --> 23:55.750
UH, YEAH.

23:55.750 --> 23:59.083
JOEY, THIS IS MY DAD.
DAD, JOEY.

23:59.083 --> 24:02.041
YEAH. IT'S--
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.208
YOU, TOO.

24:08.750 --> 24:11.041
WHAT?

24:11.041 --> 24:12.708
NOTHING.

24:15.041 --> 24:19.166
SO HOW DOES THIS
WHOLE SCALPING THING
WORK EXACTLY?

24:19.166 --> 24:20.750
I DON'T KNOW. I FIGURED
IF I STOOD HERE LONG ENOUGH

24:20.750 --> 24:22.625
WITH $600 IN MY HAND,
SOMEBODY WOULD
COME UP TO US

24:22.625 --> 24:24.708
AND MUTTER "TICKETS"
UNDER THEIR BREATH.

24:24.708 --> 24:25.125
HEH!

24:25.125 --> 24:27.959
WELL, I'M COLD.

24:27.959 --> 24:31.375
WHERE'D YOU GET ALL
THAT CASH, ANYWAY?

24:31.375 --> 24:33.083
WHAT, JUST BECAUSE
I'M A GLORIFIED P.A.,

24:33.083 --> 24:34.667
YOU THINK I CAN'T AFFORD
TO TAKE MY GIRLFRIEND

24:34.667 --> 24:35.959
TO TOWN EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE?

24:35.959 --> 24:38.875
OH, MY GOD.
YOU WON THE POOL,
DIDN'T YOU?

24:38.875 --> 24:40.125
WELL...

24:40.125 --> 24:43.208
NO, WAIT.
YOU FIXED  THE POOL.

24:45.917 --> 24:49.583
YOU'RE A LOT
CRAFTIER THAN PEOPLE
GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR.

24:49.583 --> 24:50.792
YOU KNOW, I'M
STARTING TO THINK

24:50.792 --> 24:51.792
YOU HAD
THE RIGHT IDEA

24:51.792 --> 24:55.083
WHEN YOU SUGGESTED
BAILING
ON THIS EVENT.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.917
ARE YOU MAKING ME
AN OFFER I CAN'T REFUSE,

24:56.917 --> 24:58.834
OR ARE YOU JUST COLD?

24:58.834 --> 25:00.667
UM, BOTH.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.500
PLUS, DATING'S
FOR SHMUCKS,

25:02.500 --> 25:05.041
AND WHAT WE'RE DOING
IS MUCH MORE FUN.

25:05.041 --> 25:07.500
WHAT, SNEAKING AROUND
AT WORK?

25:07.500 --> 25:10.000
I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED SNEAKING
AROUND AT WORK.

25:10.000 --> 25:10.750
OH, I DO, BUT WE'RE
NOT FOOLING ANYBODY.

25:10.750 --> 25:14.792
SURE WE ARE. WE'RE
FOOLING OURSELVES,

25:14.792 --> 25:16.000
WHICH IS
WHAT MAKES IT ALL

25:16.000 --> 25:19.417
SO INCREDIBLY
DANGEROUS.

25:20.708 --> 25:21.834
AND SEXY.

25:23.834 --> 25:24.834
AND FUN.

25:33.792 --> 25:35.834
(HORSE NEIGHS)

25:38.417 --> 25:41.667
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S BLACK BEAUTY.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.083
HEY, BOY!

25:46.542 --> 25:49.083
YOU KIDS HAVE ANY
REASON TO BE HERE,

25:49.083 --> 25:49.542
OTHER THAN
THE OBVIOUS ONE?

25:49.542 --> 25:51.208
Dawson: UH, NO, SIR.

25:51.208 --> 25:52.291
WELL, YEAH,
ACTUALLY, WE DO.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.250
WE THOUGHT WE HAD--
WELL, WE DID HAVE
TICKETS BUT--

25:54.250 --> 25:55.667
BUT YOU SOLD THEM?

25:55.667 --> 25:57.875
NO, WE DIDN'T--
WE DIDN'T SELL THEM.

25:57.875 --> 25:59.542
IT TURNED--THEY WERE
FOR TOMORROW,

25:59.542 --> 26:01.125
BUT WE GOT THE DATES
MESSED UP.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.542
AND THAT EXPLAINS
WHY YOU'RE CARRYING

26:02.542 --> 26:03.959
SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT
OF CASH ON YOU?

26:03.959 --> 26:05.333
EXCUSE ME?

26:05.333 --> 26:07.542
YOU HAVE SEVERAL
HUNDRED DOLLARS
THERE, SON.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.583
NO--YEAH, I DO,
BUT IT'S--

26:09.583 --> 26:11.208
IT'S NOT FOR THAT,
IT'S FOR THE--

26:11.208 --> 26:13.458
ME. IT'S FOR ME.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.708
HE WAS TRYING
TO SHORT ME,

26:15.708 --> 26:17.542
AND I TOLD HIM,
"NO WAY.

26:17.542 --> 26:19.542
"NO WAY AM I GONNA
DO YOU IN THIS
PARKING LOT

26:19.542 --> 26:21.375
FOR A PENNY LESS
THAN $600."

26:21.375 --> 26:23.542
WHAT'S THIS, SOME KIND
OF GAME TO YOU, MISS?

26:23.542 --> 26:24.875
NO, IT'S NOT.
THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE--

26:24.875 --> 26:28.417
LOOK, I CAN--
I CAN EXPLAIN THIS,
REALLY, I CAN.

26:28.417 --> 26:32.417
AND YOU WILL
AT THE STATION.

26:32.417 --> 26:34.959
I NEED A CHECK-BY
IN THE SOUTHWEST
CORNER, OVER.

26:34.959 --> 26:36.250
YOU'RE ARRESTING US?

26:36.250 --> 26:37.750
NO, I'M TAKING
YOU WITH ME.

26:37.750 --> 26:40.959
IF SHE SAYS ONE MORE WORD,
I'M ARRESTING YOU.

26:43.083 --> 26:46.083
COOL! LET'S GO.

26:46.083 --> 26:49.166
(CHILD-LIKE VOICE)
BYE, HORSEY!

26:49.166 --> 26:51.458
COME HERE.

27:12.458 --> 27:15.041
(BAND PLAYING
UNDERNEATH IT ALL)

29:24.750 --> 29:25.917
GO AWAY!

29:25.917 --> 29:27.166
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.333
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.
DON'T YOU GET THAT?

29:29.333 --> 29:31.834
IT WAS A MISTAKE,
A GIGANTIC MISTAKE.

29:31.834 --> 29:34.125
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU HAD A BOYFRIEND?

29:34.125 --> 29:35.583
JUST LEAVE HIM
OUT OF THIS, OK?

29:35.583 --> 29:36.875
NO, COME HERE,
COME HERE.

29:36.875 --> 29:37.291
C.J.
COME HERE.

29:37.291 --> 29:40.417
C.J., STOP!

29:40.417 --> 29:41.625
YEAH, WELL, HE'S
IN THIS, WHETHER
YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

29:41.625 --> 29:44.083
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S NOT!

29:44.083 --> 29:45.208
HE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

29:45.208 --> 29:47.333
OK, AND THE REASON
YOU CAME HOME WITH
ME THE OTHER NIGHT

29:47.333 --> 29:48.125
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO OVERWHELMINGLY
HAPPY WITH HIM.

29:48.125 --> 29:51.250
UGH!

29:51.250 --> 29:52.583
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT
TRYING TO MESS
WITH YOUR HEAD HERE.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.166
I JUST--I LIKE YOU,
AUDREY,

29:55.166 --> 29:56.125
AND YOU'RE
THE ONLY REASON
I CAME HERE TONIGHT.

29:56.125 --> 29:59.000
WELL, THEN I GUESS
THAT WAS YOUR
FIRST MISTAKE.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.959
I KNOW THINGS
ARE COMPLICATED,

30:00.959 --> 30:02.250
BUT YOU GOTTA
UNDERSTAND

30:02.250 --> 30:04.000
THAT I HAVEN'T FELT
LIKE TOWARD SOMEONE
IN A LONG TIME.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.333
NO, IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME
SINCE YOU HAD SEX,

30:05.333 --> 30:08.792
AND YOU'RE INCREDIBLY
GRATEFUL BECAUSE YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY MESSED UP,

30:08.792 --> 30:10.875
WHICH SHOULD'VE BEEN
OBVIOUS FROM THE SECOND
JEN MET YOU,

30:10.875 --> 30:13.291
BECAUSE GENERALLY,
PEOPLE WHO ARE INTO
HELPING OTHER PEOPLE

30:13.291 --> 30:15.041
ARE ABOUT 10,000 TIMES
MORE MESSED UP

30:15.041 --> 30:16.125
THAN THE PEOPLE
THEY'RE HELPING.

30:16.125 --> 30:17.375
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.500
BUT THAT DOESN'T
CHANGE THE FACT
THAT I LIKE YOU.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.417
YOU HAVE GOT TO
STOP THIS.

30:21.417 --> 30:22.834
I AM SURE THAT
UNDER THERE SOMEWHERE

30:22.834 --> 30:24.667
THERE IS A NICE GUY,
AND YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY

30:24.667 --> 30:26.583
JUST TRYING
TO HELP ME OUT,

30:26.583 --> 30:28.792
BUT WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN US, IT'S JUST--

30:28.792 --> 30:30.375
IT'S THE WAY
THAT THE WORLD WORKS, OK?

30:30.375 --> 30:32.041
PRETTY MUCH
ALL THE TIME,
GIRLS RUN AROUND

30:32.041 --> 30:33.458
AND FEEL BAD
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.875
THEY'RE EITHER TOO WEAK
OR TOO STUPID TO GO HOME ALONE.

30:35.875 --> 30:39.125
SO, SOMETIMES GUYS
JUST WIN THE LOTTERY.

30:39.125 --> 30:41.542
THAT'S IT. IT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

30:58.875 --> 31:02.834
HEY, YOU'VE BEEN
GONE A YEAR.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:02.834 --> 31:04.375
NOTHING. I'M SORRY.

31:06.083 --> 31:07.500
YOU GUYS--YOU GUYS
HAVING A PROBLEM OUT HERE?

31:07.500 --> 31:09.708
NO. WE BARELY
KNOW EACH OTHER.

31:09.708 --> 31:11.000
YEAH, RIGHT.

31:11.000 --> 31:11.917
EXCUSE ME?

31:11.917 --> 31:13.166
NOTHING. I JUST THINK
IF YOU TOOK CARE

31:13.166 --> 31:14.625
OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND
A LITTLE BIT BETTER--

31:14.625 --> 31:16.500
IF I DID WHAT?

31:16.500 --> 31:18.708
NOTHING. HE SAID NOTHING.
GO AWAY, C.J.

31:18.708 --> 31:20.000
YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE
WITH THIS GUY

31:20.000 --> 31:20.291
THAT MAKES YOU
SO MISERABLE?

31:20.291 --> 31:22.750
YES. NOW.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.000
IS THIS A JOKE?
DID HE REALLY JUST
SAY THAT TO ME?

31:24.000 --> 31:26.834
C.J., PLEASE,
IF WHAT YOU SAID
WAS TRUE ABOUT ME,

31:26.834 --> 31:29.208
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT,
THEN YOU WILL JUST
LEAVE, WALK AWAY.

31:29.208 --> 31:29.583
WAIT. WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT?

31:29.583 --> 31:32.041
AND IF I DON'T?

31:32.041 --> 31:34.917
C.J., LEAVE, NOW!

31:34.917 --> 31:36.166
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE
HAPPIER WITH HIM

31:36.166 --> 31:38.291
THAN YOU OBVIOUSLY
WERE WITH ME?

31:50.708 --> 31:51.417
YOU GUYS!

31:51.417 --> 31:53.458
COME ON, BREAK IT UP,
BREAK IT UP.

31:53.458 --> 31:55.708
COME ON,
BREAK IT UP.

32:13.917 --> 32:19.083
(BAND PLAYING
MAGIC'S IN THE MAKEUP)

33:32.375 --> 33:34.375
YOUR DAD SEEMS NICE.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.583
HE SAID FOUR WORDS
TO YOU,

33:37.583 --> 33:39.250
AND HE THINKS
YOUR NAME IS JOSIE.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.542
I DON'T MIND.

33:41.834 --> 33:44.125
HE IS...NICE.

33:44.125 --> 33:44.834
YOU KNOW,
HE WORKS HARD,

33:44.834 --> 33:46.000
PUTS FOOD
ON THE TABLE,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.959
DOESN'T CHEAT
ON MY MOM, SOLID,

33:48.959 --> 33:50.750
STEADY,
ALWAYS AROUND.

33:50.750 --> 33:53.083
SOUNDS MORE LIKE
THE SECOND COMING.

33:53.083 --> 33:54.917
YEAH. YEAH, HE'S JUST

33:54.917 --> 33:55.959
NOT TOO BIG ON
THE ENCOURAGEMENT FRONT.

33:55.959 --> 33:59.291
NOT REAL INTO
HIGHER EDUCATION.

33:59.291 --> 34:01.792
AND THAT EXPLAINS
WHY YOU DIDN'T GO
TO COLLEGE.

34:01.792 --> 34:04.083
OH, I WENT
TO COLLEGE.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.125
YOU DID?

34:05.125 --> 34:08.542
YEAH. YEAH,
ONE SEMESTER.
DROPPED OUT.

34:08.542 --> 34:11.875
THINGS HAVE TO
HAPPEN TO YOU

34:11.875 --> 34:13.833
AT THE EXACT RIGHT
TIME IN YOUR LIFE,

34:13.833 --> 34:15.500
OR THEY'RE
MEANINGLESS.

34:15.500 --> 34:18.000
MEANINGLESS?

34:18.000 --> 34:21.208
YEAH. LIKE THIS.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.625
LIKE RIGHT NOW.

34:22.625 --> 34:25.125
I MEAN, THIS COULD'VE
HAPPENED YESTERDAY

34:25.125 --> 34:27.458
AND BEEN MEANINGLESS.

34:27.458 --> 34:30.833
BUT IT'S NOT, IS IT?

34:37.917 --> 34:40.041
NO, IT ISN'T.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.417
YOU JUST HAD TO GET US
KICKED OUT, DIDN'T YOU?

35:40.417 --> 35:42.417
COULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE WAITED TILL
AFTER THE ACOUSTICAL SET?

35:42.417 --> 35:43.250
FEEL FREE
TO GO BACK ANY TIME,

35:43.250 --> 35:44.250
BECAUSE
YOU'RE REALLY
NOT NEEDED HERE.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.667
WELL, I DID FIGURE
I MIGHT DECREASE THE ODDS

35:46.667 --> 35:49.208
OF ANOTHER ONE IN YOUR GROUP
EITHER HAVING SEX

35:49.208 --> 35:50.542
OR POSSIBLY BEATING
EACH OTHER TO A PULP.

35:50.542 --> 35:52.125
YOU DON'T THINK
I HAD THE RIGHT
TO PUNCH THAT GUY?

35:52.125 --> 35:54.792
SHE'S NOT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE, MATE!

35:54.792 --> 35:57.083
NOT THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT OK
EVEN IF SHE WERE.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.875
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF HER!

35:58.875 --> 36:00.250
HE SAW THAT SHE WAS
MESSED UP

36:00.250 --> 36:01.667
AND HE PREYED ON HER,

36:01.667 --> 36:02.875
WHICH IN MY BOOKS
MAKES HIM ONE NOTCH
BELOW POND SCUM.

36:02.875 --> 36:04.959
RIGHT, RIGHT,
MUST BE THAT,

36:04.959 --> 36:06.375
BECAUSE WOMEN ARE
SUCH HELPLESS IDIOTS

36:06.375 --> 36:07.959
THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY
MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION

36:07.959 --> 36:09.834
ABOUT WHO THEY SLEEP
WITH, COULD THEY?

36:09.834 --> 36:10.834
I KNOW AUDREY.
THIS IS NOT HER.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.667
I CANNOT BELIEVE
SHE WOULD SLEEP
WITH THAT GUY.

36:12.667 --> 36:15.458
IS IT SO DIFFICULT

36:15.458 --> 36:18.000
FOR YOU JUST TO ADMIT
THAT SHE HURT YOU?

36:18.000 --> 36:19.208
OR THAT YOU MIGHT FEEL
A LITTLE GUILTY

36:19.208 --> 36:21.875
ABOUT THE WAY THINGS
ENDED, OR THAT POSSIBLY,

36:21.875 --> 36:24.500
DESPITE ALL YOUR
PROTESTATIONS TO THE CONTRARY,

36:24.500 --> 36:27.375
THAT YOU STILL WANT TO
SAVE THIS GIRL?

36:28.000 --> 36:31.166
OF COURSE,
IT'S DIFFICULT.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.500
IT JUST IS.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.917
WOULD YOU
QUIT SQUIRMING?

36:39.917 --> 36:41.542
YOU'RE LUCKY I'M EVEN
TALKING TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

36:41.542 --> 36:44.417
THIS IS BRINGING YOU
A GREAT DEAL OF
SATISFACTION, ISN'T IT?

36:44.417 --> 36:47.083
NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

36:47.083 --> 36:48.542
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
TO YOURSELF RIGHT NOW

36:48.542 --> 36:49.792
THAT I DESERVE THIS?

36:49.792 --> 36:53.708
NO. YOU AND AUDREY
ARE BOTH ADULTS,

36:53.708 --> 36:55.792
AND I AM NOT GONNA
SIT HERE AND APPLY

36:55.792 --> 36:58.333
SOME RIDICULOUS
DOUBLE STANDARD
TO THE SITUATION,

36:58.333 --> 37:00.417
JUST BECAUSE MY FEELINGS
GOT A LITTLE BIT HURT.

37:02.333 --> 37:05.417
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I WISH THAT HADN'T
HAPPENED.

37:05.417 --> 37:06.458
YEAH, I KNOW.

37:09.542 --> 37:11.708
YOU KNOW, ALL THAT STUFF
THAT YOU'VE BEEN SAYING

37:11.708 --> 37:13.250
IS FINALLY STARTING
TO SINK IN,

37:13.250 --> 37:15.041
ALL THAT STUFF THAT
YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME
ABOUT YOURSELF,

37:15.041 --> 37:17.959
AND I GUESS
THAT IF IT'S TRUE,

37:17.959 --> 37:20.667
THEN IT PROBABLY
REALLY SUCKS
TO BE YOU RIGHT NOW

37:20.667 --> 37:24.083
BECAUSE NO MATTER
HOW NOMINALLY TOGETHER

37:24.083 --> 37:25.917
YOU THINK YOU ARE,
IF YOUR FONDEST DESIRE

37:25.917 --> 37:27.792
IS TO START HANGING OUT
WITH AUDREY,

37:27.792 --> 37:30.208
THEN CHANCES ARE,
IT'S NOT GONNA
STAY THAT WAY.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.041
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF I EVER GOT IT
INTO MY HEAD

37:32.041 --> 37:34.250
TO DO WHAT YOU DO,
YOU KNOW,
TO HELP PEOPLE,

37:34.250 --> 37:36.708
I WOULD BE A HELL OF
A LOT BETTER AT IT

37:36.708 --> 37:37.500
THAN YOU ARE.

37:42.542 --> 37:44.083
SO YOU REALLY
DON'T MIND
TAKING AUDREY HOME?

37:44.083 --> 37:46.333
WELL, SURE, I MIND,

37:46.333 --> 37:47.959
BUT, YOU KNOW,
MY INNER DRAMA QUEEN
RESPECTS HER REFUSAL

37:47.959 --> 37:50.417
TO COME OUT
OF THE BATHROOM

37:50.417 --> 37:50.959
TILL JEN
AND PACEY LEAVE.

37:50.959 --> 37:53.458
HEH HEH HEH!
THANKS, MAN.

37:53.458 --> 37:54.417
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
DITCH JEN, YOU KNOW.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.333
I MEAN, I DON'T
THINK THIS EVENING
TURNED OUT

37:57.333 --> 37:58.667
QUITE THE WAY
SHE PLANNED.

37:58.667 --> 38:01.667
HMM. YEAH.
I KNOW THE FEELING.

38:01.667 --> 38:04.417
SO, WE'RE, UH,
NOT DOING TOO WELL
AT THIS, ARE WE?

38:04.417 --> 38:05.750
WELL, THE HANGING OUT
HAS BEEN GOOD.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.875
BUT THE DATING?

38:07.875 --> 38:09.959
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY

38:09.959 --> 38:11.542
THAT WHEN TWO GAY GUYS
GO ON A DATE,

38:11.542 --> 38:13.834
AND EACH ENDS UP
GOING HOME
WITH A HOT BLOND GIRL,

38:13.834 --> 38:15.083
SOMETHING'S DEFINITELY
NOT WORKING.

38:15.083 --> 38:15.959
YEAH.

38:15.959 --> 38:18.792
QUICK, MAKE A BREAK
FOR IT BEFORE HE COMES!

38:18.792 --> 38:19.792
I CAN'T--

38:19.792 --> 38:22.959
I CAN'T--YOU ARE
STILL NOT TAKING
THIS SERIOUSLY.

38:22.959 --> 38:25.125
WE DIDN'T GET ARRESTED.
THEY JUST GAVE US
A WARNING.

38:25.125 --> 38:27.375
THEY GAVE US
ONE PHONE CALL.

38:27.375 --> 38:31.333
OHH! THEY WERE
HAVING FUN, LIKE US.

38:31.333 --> 38:33.375
OH, COME ON!
THIS ENTIRE EVENING
HAS BEEN FUN,

38:33.375 --> 38:38.208
FROM START TO FINISH,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

38:38.208 --> 38:40.458
YES,
THIS HAS BEEN FUN.

38:40.458 --> 38:41.750
I'M STARTING
TO THINK YOU MIGHT
BE INSANE, BUT--

38:41.750 --> 38:45.125
BUT WHAT? YOU HAVEN'T
EVER GONE OUT WITH
AN INSANE PERSON BEFORE?

38:45.125 --> 38:48.708
NO, I HAVE, JUST...
NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

38:48.708 --> 38:50.542
MMM.

38:52.792 --> 38:56.708
OK, SHAGWITS,
TO THE CAR!

38:56.708 --> 39:00.333
LET'S GO!
CHOP, BLOODY CHOP!

39:00.333 --> 39:03.208
OR AM I GONNA HAVE TO THROW
COLD WATER ON YOU BOTH?

39:04.166 --> 39:05.500
Dawson:
I THINK HE'S MAD.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.750
REAL MAD.

39:07.834 --> 39:09.500
FOR THE RECORD,

39:09.500 --> 39:11.458
NEVER LET IT BE SAID

39:11.458 --> 39:13.417
THAT TODD CARR IS A MAN
WHO'S NOT IN LOVE

39:13.417 --> 39:15.417
WITH BEING IN LOVE.

39:15.417 --> 39:17.917
I THINK BOTH MY MOVIES
AND MY LIFE

39:17.917 --> 39:20.542
REFLECT MY DEEP
AND ABIDING COMMITMENT

39:20.542 --> 39:23.667
TO GETTING TWO GOOD-LOOKING
YOUNG PEOPLE TOGETHER

39:23.667 --> 39:25.667
AND HAVING A BIT OF FUN
NOW AND AGAIN.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.208
HOWEVER...

39:30.417 --> 39:31.500
AS LEERY HERE
BLOODY WELL KNOWS...

39:31.500 --> 39:35.083
YOU'RE ALSO A MAN
WHO'S IN LOVE
WITH SLEEP.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.583
TO THE CAR. NOW.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.458
(SUPPRESSING LAUGHTER)

39:44.458 --> 39:46.291
(IMITATING TODD)
TO THE CAR.

39:46.291 --> 39:48.250
HEH HEH HEH!

39:51.542 --> 39:54.041
SO...THIS IS IT?

39:54.041 --> 39:56.667
YEAH.
YEAH.

39:56.667 --> 39:58.667
YEAH.

39:59.917 --> 40:01.708
END OF THE NIGHT.

40:01.708 --> 40:02.959
YEAH.

40:02.959 --> 40:06.083
HEH HEH.

40:16.208 --> 40:17.834
HEH HEH!

40:21.208 --> 40:22.542
SO YOU NEVER
DID TELL ME
WHAT YOURS IS LIKE.

40:24.875 --> 40:26.208
MY DAD?

40:26.208 --> 40:28.166
YEAH.

40:28.166 --> 40:30.083
WELL, COME ON.
I SHOWED YOU MINE.

40:30.083 --> 40:32.250
MMPH. LET'S JUST

40:32.250 --> 40:34.834
CALL HIM THE OPPOSITE
AND LEAVE IT AT THAT.

40:34.834 --> 40:35.583
OPPOSITE.

40:35.583 --> 40:40.625
AS IN NOT SOLID,
NOT HARD-WORKING.

40:40.625 --> 40:43.792
UM...

40:43.792 --> 40:45.834
HE'S A BIG FAN OF
CHEATING ON MY MOM.

40:45.834 --> 40:48.625
UM, HE'S DEFINITELY
NOT THE TYPE

40:48.625 --> 40:50.750
TO DO SOME BACK-BREAKING
JOB FOR 25 YEARS

40:50.750 --> 40:51.708
WHEN THERE'S EASY MONEY
TO BE MADE

40:51.708 --> 40:54.834
IN THE LESS LAW-ABIDING
SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY.

40:54.834 --> 40:57.291
YOU MAKE HIM SOUND
LIKE A CRIMINAL.

40:57.291 --> 41:00.083
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS
CALL HIM.

41:00.083 --> 41:01.792
HMPH. I STILL
THINK OF HIM AS DAD.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.417
WOW.

41:06.125 --> 41:08.917
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HE MUST'VE DONE
SOMETHING RIGHT.

41:10.291 --> 41:12.291
WHY? 'CAUSE I TURNED OUT
SO WELL?

41:12.291 --> 41:13.542
WHAT, YOU THINK
BEING ENTOMBED

41:13.542 --> 41:17.583
IN THESE HALLOWED
HALLS EQUALS
TURNING OUT WELL?

41:17.583 --> 41:20.458
WELL, IT'S A START,
ISN'T IT?

41:20.458 --> 41:22.917
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO
MORE WORK ON YOU
THAN I THOUGHT.

41:22.917 --> 41:26.291
YOU THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THESE HALLOWED HALLS?

41:26.291 --> 41:28.667
NO. NOT IF YOU'RE HERE
FOR THE RIGHT REASON.

41:29.959 --> 41:32.375
WELL, MY DAD...

41:32.375 --> 41:33.500
WHEN HE ACTUALLY
WAS AROUND

41:33.500 --> 41:37.291
WAS VERY GOOD ON
THE ENCOURAGEMENT PART

41:37.291 --> 41:39.875
IN THAT "DREAM-BIG,
LITTLE-GIRL,

41:39.875 --> 41:42.708
YOU-CAN-BE-ANYTHING
YOU-WANT-TO-BE"
SORT OF WAY.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.750
I SEE.

41:47.166 --> 41:50.333
AND WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT TO BE,
LITTLE GIRL?

41:50.333 --> 41:53.250
HMPH!

41:53.250 --> 41:55.291
I DON'T KNOW.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.583
GUESS I'M
A WORK IN PROGRESS.

42:29.041 --> 42:30.083
GOOD NIGHT.

42:30.083 --> 42:31.750
GOOD NIGHT.
