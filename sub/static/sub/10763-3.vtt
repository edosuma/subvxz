WEBVTT

00:09.609 --> 00:11.111
Oh, hello, Dad. Hi, Niles.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.612
May I get my usual, please?

00:12.612 --> 00:14.603
Niles, we're playing
squash in 20 minutes.

00:15.115 --> 00:16.104
Where are your togs?

00:16.616 --> 00:18.118
Oh, yes, I had to hide
them in my briefcase.

00:18.118 --> 00:19.619
I told Daphne I was
seeing patients all day.

00:19.619 --> 00:21.121
It was the only way I could get out

00:21.121 --> 00:22.110
of driving her to this flower show.

00:22.622 --> 00:23.623
It's two hours there and back.

00:23.623 --> 00:25.125
I see; well, we could have rescheduled.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.615
Did you really have to lie?

00:27.127 --> 00:28.617
Did I mention we'd be
joined by Daphne's mother,

00:29.129 --> 00:30.630
who's suffering from
some female complaint

00:30.630 --> 00:32.131
and can't get it through her head

00:32.131 --> 00:33.531
that I'm not a gynecologist?

00:33.767 --> 00:38.071
Ah. Well, then, you
had to save yourself.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.440
so, please, don't tell anyone
we're playing squash today.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.442
I can't have it getting back to Daphne.

00:42.442 --> 00:43.443
Right. Hey, guys.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.432
I'm so glad you're here.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.146
You can meet my new boyfriend.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.447
He's the hottest guy
I've dated since.. .

00:47.447 --> 00:48.448
Frasier.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.439
Okay, the hottest guy

00:51.151 --> 00:53.453
(cracking up) ; since Frasier.

00:53.453 --> 00:55.155
That's Alistair Burke.

00:55.155 --> 00:56.144
I know!

00:56.322 --> 00:58.258
Who's Alistair Burke?

00:58.258 --> 00:59.247
He is only the head of
the seattle Opera Guild

00:59.559 --> 01:01.261
and one of the finest
directors in the world.

01:01.261 --> 01:02.562
His productions are brilliant.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.263
He staged a Philip
Glass opera last year,

01:04.263 --> 01:05.561
and no one left.

01:06.266 --> 01:07.563
Alistair, uh, it's, it's Frasier Crane.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.569
Uh, we met last year
at the fund-raiser.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.570
Of course.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.272
You're on the radio.

01:12.272 --> 01:12.567
Yes, yes.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.262
And you're... don't tell me.

01:15.575 --> 01:18.178
All right, tell me.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.146
Niles Crane.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.215
Yes, we've both got
ticket s to your premiere,

01:22.215 --> 01:23.216
and, oh, we can't wait to see

01:23.216 --> 01:24.517
what magic you'll work with La Boheme.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.519
Well, I would be content

01:26.519 --> 01:29.522
if my Mimi would just
lay off the cheeseburgers.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.524
I sat her down yesterday and I said,

01:31.524 --> 01:33.526
'You're dying of consumption, dear,

01:33.526 --> 01:35.221
not overcon sumption. "

01:35.528 --> 01:36.517
(both guffawing)

01:37.230 --> 01:39.232
FRAsIER; Oh, that's hilarious!

01:39.232 --> 01:40.233
It's funny because it's bitchy.

01:40.233 --> 01:41.234
How well you're looking.

01:41.234 --> 01:42.535
Oh, thank you.

01:42.535 --> 01:43.229
I like your suit.

01:43.536 --> 01:44.537
Well, you're too kind.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.539
And it's nice to see you again.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.241
Bye-bye.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.243
Take care.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.437
Wow, that was thorough.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.870
Find any polyps up there?

01:56.816 --> 01:59.385
We were merely paying due respect

01:59.385 --> 02:02.322
to one of the giants of the opera world.

02:02.322 --> 02:03.690
Hey! Barry, hi.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.181
This is Frasier and Niles...

02:06.693 --> 02:07.694
and Martin.

02:07.694 --> 02:08.695
Hi. Hi.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.697
Whoa, strong handshake.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.365
You look like you work out a lot.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.458
He practically lives at the gym.

02:15.168 --> 02:16.157
Well, it's my church .

02:16.469 --> 02:18.460
Oh, this blouse looks amazing on you.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.873
Yes, it's very chic, Roz.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.374
Well, Barry picked it out.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.876
He's the women's wear buyer at Bidwells.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.878
He spent a whole day last
week going through my closet

02:24.878 --> 02:27.881
and throwing out all the
stuff I shouldn't wear anymore.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.383
You should have seen what
she was still hanging on to.

02:30.383 --> 02:31.372
Culottes.

02:31.684 --> 02:33.753
stop it.

02:33.753 --> 02:35.755
Well...

02:35.755 --> 02:37.757
one wonders what's
been in Barry's closet

02:37.757 --> 02:38.746
a little too long.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.928
What are you talking about?

02:44.264 --> 02:45.856
Oh, come on. He didn't seem gay to you ?

02:46.366 --> 02:47.867
That guy's not gay.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.858
You know how you can tell?

02:50.370 --> 02:52.304
The muscles.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.575
Good point, Dad.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.566
second tip-off; no poodle.

02:59.445 --> 03:02.282
so, isn't he fabulous?

03:02.282 --> 03:05.885
Yes, yes, uh, fabulous
sums it up in a word.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.388
I think he's perfect
for you, Roz--

03:08.388 --> 03:11.255
good-looking, friendly
and not gay at all.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.593
Who said he was gay?

03:13.593 --> 03:14.594
Not me.

03:14.594 --> 03:15.583
He's not gay.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.285
All right, Roz, but you can see

03:17.597 --> 03:19.299
how someone might get that impression.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.300
Why, because of his job?

03:20.300 --> 03:21.597
Because he takes care of himself?

03:22.302 --> 03:24.304
That is just such lazy, stereotypical...

03:24.304 --> 03:26.306
You're right; it was a
shallow knee-jerk assumption

03:26.306 --> 03:27.607
and unworthy of us both

03:27.607 --> 03:28.869
as psychiatrists and men about town.

03:31.411 --> 03:33.379
We better go. We're
going to miss the movie.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.681
Right. Bye.

03:34.681 --> 03:35.670
No biscotti for you?

03:36.382 --> 03:37.371
Please. I'm a house.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.382
(no audio)

03:48.494 --> 03:49.495
Can't you walk any faster?

03:49.495 --> 03:50.997
I'm moving as fast as I can

03:50.997 --> 03:52.498
in these ridiculous shorts of yours.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.000
You wouldn't need them

03:54.000 --> 03:55.501
if you hadn't burs t out of your own.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.490
I did not burst out of them.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.504
My laundress simply over bleached them

03:58.504 --> 04:01.007
till they had the tensile
strength of a cobweb.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.008
If you're in such a hurry,

04:02.008 --> 04:03.509
you should have brought your own car.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.011
Daphne needed it for her flower show.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.013
And remember... Yes, yes.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.503
You were seeing patients.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.516
We did not play squash.

04:10.516 --> 04:12.006
Is that Roz's boy friend ?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.356
Oh, you don't suppose she told him

04:16.356 --> 04:17.656
what we were saying about him?

04:17.656 --> 04:19.425
No, I can't imagine she would do that.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.414
Let's just act natural.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.665
Where did he go?

04:25.665 --> 04:27.530
Odd. He was just here.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.303
"Bad Billy's?"

04:31.804 --> 04:33.294
What sort of place do you think that is?

04:33.806 --> 04:35.308
Well, let's see.

04:35.308 --> 04:37.810
Tuesday is leather night,

04:37.810 --> 04:40.643
so it's probably some
sort of shoe outlet.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.284
It's a gay bar, you idiot.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.585
Come on. Let's go.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.287
What?! No!

04:47.287 --> 04:48.588
I told Daphne

04:48.588 --> 04:50.283
I was seeing patients until 7:00.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.292
If I'm late, she might get suspicious.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.993
Niles, Roz is my friend.

04:53.993 --> 04:54.994
I'm not going to let her get hurt

04:54.994 --> 04:56.996
by some man who's lying
to her about himself.

04:56.996 --> 04:58.486
I'll be just a minute.

05:05.004 --> 05:07.507
Excuse me. Uh, I'm looking for a guy.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.873
Yeah, I kind of got
that from the shorts.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.333
It's a particular guy.

05:12.845 --> 05:13.846
He's about 35 years...

05:13.846 --> 05:14.847
Frasier?

05:14.847 --> 05:16.349
Eduardo!

05:16.349 --> 05:20.353
My furniture polisher.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.355
Don't tell me you put
away paste and chamois

05:22.355 --> 05:23.356
for life as a barkeep.

05:23.356 --> 05:24.957
I just do this on the side.

05:24.957 --> 05:27.527
Oh, well, bet you're
surprised to see me in here.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.154
Okay.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.922
All right, look,

05:32.398 --> 05:33.900
I thought I saw a friend
of mine come in here.

05:33.900 --> 05:37.631
He's, uh, mid-30s, uh,
wavy hair, good build.

05:37.904 --> 05:38.971
Yeah, I think he's in the bathroom.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.473
Oh. Oh.

05:40.473 --> 05:41.462
(music blaring)

05:41.974 --> 05:43.464
Can I get you a drink?

05:47.480 --> 05:48.970
sherry, please.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:00.493 --> 06:02.495
Oh, hi, Niles.

06:02.495 --> 06:03.792
Hey, Barry.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.501
Frasier. Barry's not here.

06:19.812 --> 06:20.801
I just saw him. What?

06:21.514 --> 06:22.503
Barry's not here. Let's go.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.807
He's in the bathroom.

06:24.183 --> 06:25.451
No, he's not.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.119
Can we just go, please?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.587
What did you say?

06:27.587 --> 06:28.576
Daphne's expecting me.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.089
Let's go.

06:30.089 --> 06:31.579
 Come again? Oh, for God's sake..

06:32.091 --> 06:32.580
(music stops)

06:33.092 --> 06:35.083
I'm begging you, please take me home!

06:43.803 --> 06:47.507
You see, actually, he and I are...

06:47.507 --> 06:49.498
(music begins)

07:03.523 --> 07:04.991
You can rationalize your actions

07:04.991 --> 07:06.925
all you want to, kevin. The truth is,

07:07.593 --> 07:08.895
you're just not being honest, are you?

07:08.895 --> 07:10.696
I guess I'm not.

07:10.696 --> 07:12.198
But it's not like you're so honest

07:12.198 --> 07:14.200
about everything in your life.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.601
I beg your pardon.

07:15.601 --> 07:19.594
Well, you've never told
your audience you're gay.

07:21.741 --> 07:22.765
Excuse me?

07:23.209 --> 07:26.579
I saw you in a gay bar last night.

07:26.579 --> 07:30.016
Oh. Oh, I see.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.618
(chuckling); Yes, in fact,

07:32.618 --> 07:35.888
I did pop into Bad Billy'? yesterday.

07:35.888 --> 07:38.024
You see, I thought

07:38.024 --> 07:41.093
I had seen a gentleman I wished
to speak with go in there,

07:41.093 --> 07:43.095
and I'd certainly never
been in that bar before.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.461
Then how come you knew
the bartender by name?

07:45.965 --> 07:48.601
And why were you wearing
those tight little shorts?

07:48.601 --> 07:50.102
Well, they...

07:50.102 --> 07:52.104
They were not my shorts.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.607
You see, I'd been playing squash,

07:54.607 --> 07:57.076
and I borrowed them from my...

07:57.076 --> 07:59.946
uh, from my friend who is slim-hipped.

07:59.946 --> 08:03.177
Yeah, kind of like that
nervous guy you picked up.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.139
Look, I did not pick anybody up.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.643
All right, I am going to
put an end to this discussion

08:08.120 --> 08:09.622
because there is nothing to discuss.

08:09.622 --> 08:14.126
On my way home from the gym,
I popped into Bad Billy's

08:14.126 --> 08:18.529
Iooking for a man I was
hoping was in the bathroom.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.768
I had a quick sherry
with my French polisher,

08:22.768 --> 08:24.770
and then I left.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.273
As to how I got into
another man's shorts,

08:27.273 --> 08:28.262
that is no one's business.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.635
And we're off the air.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.134
Oh, dear God.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.640
That man you thought you
saw going into Bad Billy's--

08:40.152 --> 08:41.153
that wouldn't be Barry, would it?

08:41.153 --> 08:43.155
All right, Roz.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.155
I-I saw him on the
street, and I turned,

08:44.155 --> 08:46.158
and the next thing I knew, he was gone.

08:46.158 --> 08:47.147
You know what Barry was doing

08:47.660 --> 08:49.161
from 1 0:00 until midnight last night?

08:49.161 --> 08:50.651
Me, that's what!

08:52.665 --> 08:54.656
He's not gay, whereas you, Miss Marple,

08:55.167 --> 08:56.168
you've just been outed.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.670
Outed?

08:57.670 --> 09:01.173
Frasier.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.162
I am so sorry.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.165
I thought that last call was appalling.

09:04.677 --> 09:05.166
Thank you, Gil.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.179
You poor man.

09:07.179 --> 09:10.671
How long you must have dreaded
this dark yet inevitable day.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.587
I so wish you could have
been allowed to come out

09:14.587 --> 09:16.589
in a time and manner
of your own choosing

09:16.589 --> 09:19.091
instead of being
wrenched from your closet,

09:19.091 --> 09:21.582
your voice cracking, your
cheeks crimson with shame.

09:22.094 --> 09:24.564
Gil, I am not gay.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.065
Oh, Frasier, you can't play coy

09:26.065 --> 09:29.068
once you've been caught
traipsing around Bad Billy's

09:29.068 --> 09:31.070
in shorts that left
little to the imagination.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.572
They were not my shorts.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.074
I simply borrowed them
because my own had split

09:35.074 --> 09:36.576
when I bent over...

09:36.576 --> 09:38.578
Oh, please!

09:38.578 --> 09:41.080
We don't need to know everything.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.082
I just want to say that your kACL family

09:43.082 --> 09:44.584
will be here for you

09:44.584 --> 09:46.074
as you take your first brave steps

09:46.586 --> 09:47.587
on that yellow brick road

09:47.587 --> 09:49.589
to pride and self
- acceptance and...

09:49.589 --> 09:52.080
Oh, shut up, you big queen!

09:55.294 --> 09:58.263
I see kitty has claws.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.738
Another latte to go, please.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.239
And you can take it
out of there, thank you.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.741
 I-I didn't order these

10:08.741 --> 10:11.232
They're from those guys over there.

10:16.248 --> 10:18.739
Oh, Dad. You care for a coffee ?

10:19.251 --> 10:20.753
Nah. I can see where you might think

10:20.753 --> 10:21.754
I would, though.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.756
A guy walks into a coffee bar,

10:23.756 --> 10:25.747
he can't blame people for
thinking he likes coffee.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.760
Yes, Dad.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.762
Course, uh, if he didn't like it,

10:29.762 --> 10:31.263
he could make that clear to people.

10:31.263 --> 10:34.266
He might say, "I am
not a coffee drinker"

10:34.266 --> 10:36.769
or "I have never

10:36.769 --> 10:38.771
tried coffee even once. "

10:38.771 --> 10:40.272
Yes, all right, Dad.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.775
"I am not even curious about... "

10:42.775 --> 10:45.266
Yes, all right!

10:45.778 --> 10:47.268
Thank you.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.786
Frasier.

10:53.786 --> 10:54.787
I see you caught my show.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.288
Mm-hmm.

10:56.288 --> 10:57.289
Go ahead. Let's hear it.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.792
I'm not going to tease
you. I'm grateful.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.260
You could have ratted me out to Daphne,

11:01.260 --> 11:03.262
but instead, you protected me...

11:03.262 --> 11:05.753
just like a big sister should.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.759
You know, I'm glad this tickles you.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.772
I shouldn't make fun.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.274
You people have been
persecuted long enough as it is.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.263
Are you done?

11:16.776 --> 11:18.778
I'm done. I'll return those
shorts to you tomorrow.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.269
No, keep them. You'll
want them for the parade.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.783
I'm done. Now I'm done.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.785
Frasier.

11:25.785 --> 11:29.288
Oh, Alistair. so sorry to
hear about your ordeal today.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.290
Oh, boy... You heard my show then?

11:31.290 --> 11:32.279
No, I heard the replay

11:32.792 --> 11:35.283
on kiki and Mel's Drivetime Circus.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.798
If it's any comfort,

11:38.798 --> 11:41.300
I went through the
same thing myself once.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.803
Really? Yes, I was a
guest on a call-in show,

11:43.803 --> 11:46.305
and an angry ex-boyfriend phoned in.

11:46.305 --> 11:50.309
Everything came out;
names, dates, birthmarks.

11:50.309 --> 11:53.813
Had quite a chat with
the wife that night.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.314
Very frank.

11:55.314 --> 11:56.303
Very expensive. Oh.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.716
How awful for you. Of
course, in my case...

11:59.218 --> 12:01.721
I know what might rally your spirits.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.710
I'm giving a small party

12:03.222 --> 12:05.224
after the premiere
of my opera next week.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.225
Are you free to come?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.227
I'd be delighted.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.228
splendid.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.230
Well, I must get to rehearsals.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.732
Oh, how are things coming?

12:12.732 --> 12:13.721
You can tag along,

12:14.233 --> 12:16.001
see for yourself if you like.

12:16.001 --> 12:17.737
FRAsIER; I would love that.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.739
Let me just grab my coffee.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.728
Good-bye, Dad.

12:21.040 --> 12:21.734
Niles.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.749
Did you see that?

12:29.749 --> 12:32.051
I would kill to go to that party.

12:32.051 --> 12:34.019
I was at that gay bar too, you know.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.024
Let's see...

12:39.024 --> 12:41.427
One of my sons just
got picked up by a guy.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.418
My other son is jealous.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.422
Yep, life is good.

12:51.203 --> 12:54.206
Dad, please clean up that
debris around your chair.

12:54.206 --> 12:55.207
Alistair is coming by.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.903
"Oh, Alistair. "

12:58.210 --> 12:59.905
That's all we've heard
around here all week.

13:00.212 --> 13:02.214
Alistair this, Alistair that.

13:02.214 --> 13:03.983
m DAPHNE; You can't blame hi

13:03.983 --> 13:05.084
for being excited.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.786
It's fun having a famous friend.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.522
When I lived in England...

13:09.522 --> 13:11.056
Do you know the actor Peter O' Toole?

13:11.056 --> 13:12.558
sure.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.561
I always thought it would be
fun to be friends with him.

13:15.561 --> 13:18.063
(doorbell rings)

13:18.063 --> 13:20.065
Now, that's him.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.056
Everyone just act natural.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.059
Frasier! Alistair!

13:27.573 --> 13:29.975
ALIsTAIR; You smell fantastic.

13:29.975 --> 13:30.976
Oh, it must be my new conditioner.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.979
sandalwood with just a hint of...?

13:33.979 --> 13:34.980
Cloves.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.515
The man's amazing.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.484
He has the musical panache
of Leonard Bernstein

13:38.484 --> 13:42.488
and the nose of a Tuscan truffle hog.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.989
You turn my head, sir.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.854
(laughing); Oh, well...
come and meet my father,

13:46.258 --> 13:47.293
Martin Crane.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.994
Well, how lovely to meet you, Martin.

13:48.994 --> 13:49.929
How are you?

13:49.929 --> 13:50.963
Niles. Hello.

13:50.963 --> 13:51.964
Love the tie.

13:51.964 --> 13:52.965
Charvet.

13:52.965 --> 13:56.068
And I'm Daphne , Niles' wife.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.559
No.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.473
We're expecting.

14:01.473 --> 14:04.844
Can't say I was.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.209
How lovely to meet you, Daphne.

14:06.912 --> 14:07.913
Likewise.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.216
Frasier, this apartment is stunning.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.205
Thank you.
The view--

14:11.917 --> 14:12.918
breathtaking.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.220
The art--
perfect.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.916
The chair--
hilarious.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.193
(phone rings) Damn. so sorry.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.888
I have to take this call.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.059
Hello?

14:24.463 --> 14:26.966
Placido!

14:26.966 --> 14:27.967
Placido Domingo?!

14:27.967 --> 14:28.956
Yes.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.527
I'm here with Frasier.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.531
Yes, he's the one I told you about.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.464
Oh, stop.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.502
Oh, oh, yes, uh... in the kitchen

14:39.945 --> 14:42.448
Well, you'll meet him next
month at the concert in Madrid.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.940
Oops, now I've spoiled the surprise.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.921
He's taking me to Madrid!

14:54.927 --> 14:57.259
You just met him last
week. What's going on?

14:57.496 --> 14:58.053
He kissed you.

14:58.497 --> 14:59.999
Well, he's a man of the theater.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.500
He kisses everyone.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.002
It's not like he's the first
gay friend I've ever had.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.027
It's the first one who
thinks you're gay, too.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.340
gay. He does not think I'm

15:08.340 --> 15:12.003
He thinks I'm gay, and I'm
standing next to my pregnant wife.

15:14.179 --> 15:16.515
Have you told him you're straight?

15:16.515 --> 15:20.085
I don't have to. I mean, it's obvious.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.588
We are just friends.
He is not courting me.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.089
Is that a new watch?

15:24.089 --> 15:26.023
so what if it is?

15:28.594 --> 15:31.130
Jewelry. Ooh, he's a keeper.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.999
stop that!

15:33.999 --> 15:35.000
My friendship with Alistair

15:35.000 --> 15:36.502
is the best thing that's
happened to me in months.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.003
I will not have you sully it

15:38.003 --> 15:39.071
by making it out to
be something it's not.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.698
sorry, my angel.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.311
Well, we'd best get to that tailor.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.312
Oh, yes, yes.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.013
We're having new tuxes made

15:48.013 --> 15:50.015
for Alistair's premiere
part y this weekend.

15:50.015 --> 15:51.583
To which you are all invited.

15:51.583 --> 15:52.675
(gasps) ; Thank you.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.622
Will Peter O'Toole be there?

15:56.622 --> 15:58.613
No... and he knows why.

16:01.193 --> 16:03.195
These are amazing.
Where did you get them?

16:03.195 --> 16:04.196
I made them myself.

16:04.196 --> 16:05.698
No...

16:05.698 --> 16:08.200
Is there anything this man can't do?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.566
Time will tell.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.553
Look at this crowd.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.054
It's like a Who's Who

16:29.054 --> 16:33.058
of the creme de la
creme of the upper crust!

16:33.058 --> 16:35.060
Frasier. Alistair.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.563
Your production was a triumph!

16:37.563 --> 16:38.564
Wasn't it?

16:38.564 --> 16:40.054
smile.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.570
Welcome, welcome. Thank you.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.071
There are so many people here

16:46.071 --> 16:47.573
I'm dying for you to meet,

16:47.573 --> 16:49.074
but I have to make a
little announcement first.

16:49.074 --> 16:52.578
Glinka, darling, come and meet Frasier.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.580
Frasier, finally.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.582
Oh, Glinka, it's such
an honor to meet you.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.084
I have all your recordings.

16:59.084 --> 17:02.087
so, I hear that you and
Alistair are quite an item.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.078
Oh, no, no, no, we're
just very good friends.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.580
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.093
Everyone,

17:08.093 --> 17:10.596
? . could I have your attention, please

17:10.596 --> 17:14.098
I have to announce that
our very own Nigel Fry

17:14.098 --> 17:16.157
is retiring and giving up his seat

17:16.335 --> 17:18.069
on the Opera board...

17:18.069 --> 17:19.070
(all sigh sadly)

17:19.070 --> 17:22.241
...but I am thrilled
to name as his successor

17:22.241 --> 17:25.243
a tireless supporter
of opera in seattle,

17:25.243 --> 17:27.178
Dr. Frasier Crane.

17:28.313 --> 17:31.316
Oh! Oh, my! Oh, I never dreamed...

17:31.316 --> 17:33.318
Oh, thank you, thank you!

17:33.318 --> 17:35.309
Congratu... Iations.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.823
stunning couple, aren't they?

17:37.823 --> 17:41.122
I'm more stunned by them each day.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.463
Oh, Daph. Quite an honor.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.165
Oh, my God! Isn't it thrilling?

17:46.165 --> 17:47.332
Frasier, can we talk to
you for a moment? Yes.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.300
Do you realize that
every person in this room

17:49.802 --> 17:51.804
thinks that you're Alistair's boyfriend?

17:51.804 --> 17:53.795
 Listen, I can't help it if
people think we're a couple

17:54.306 --> 17:55.808
The point is I'm enjoying myself,

17:55.808 --> 17:56.797
and if you're too jealous
to be happy for me,

17:57.309 --> 17:58.310
then that's your problem.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.311
Jealous?!

17:59.311 --> 18:00.813
Yes, that's right.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.714
All my life I have dreamed

18:02.714 --> 18:04.204
of being half of a power couple,

18:04.716 --> 18:06.707
and I finally am.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.723
Is it perfect? No.

18:11.723 --> 18:14.226
. But it's fun, and
I don't want it to end

18:14.226 --> 18:15.727
Don't you worry at all

18:15.727 --> 18:17.729
that Alistair might be falling for you?

18:17.729 --> 18:19.720
Oh, please. The man has
not even made a move on me,

18:20.232 --> 18:21.233
and do you know why?

18:21.233 --> 18:23.735
Because we are friends.

18:23.735 --> 18:26.238
Famous, fabulous friends.

18:26.238 --> 18:27.739
Oh, uh, Alistair.

18:27.739 --> 18:28.740
Congratulations.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.242
It was a stunning production.

18:30.242 --> 18:31.743
Oh, thank you, Niles.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.745
It must be awfully hard
work putting on an opera.

18:33.745 --> 18:35.747
It is utterly draining.

18:35.747 --> 18:36.748
In fact, when I'm in rehearsals,

18:36.748 --> 18:39.751
I devote every ounce of strength to it.

18:39.751 --> 18:42.254
No exercising, no jogging.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.756
I even abstain from sex.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.247
re. Well, you can ask Frasier he

18:48.694 --> 18:51.686
My poor, dear, patient Frasier.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.702
Care to dance?

18:56.702 --> 18:58.704
I would love to.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.695
Don't go far.

19:08.213 --> 19:11.216
Well, looks like Nigel
won't be the only one

19:11.216 --> 19:13.207
giving up his seat tonight.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.224
I could scratch your eyes out

19:19.224 --> 19:21.715
and not one person here
would find it strange.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.720
I'm sorry.

19:27.232 --> 19:30.724
Damn my fatal allure.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.740
Alistair... when you're
finish with this dance...

19:34.740 --> 19:36.241
Oh, no.

19:36.241 --> 19:37.731
Be my guest.

19:42.247 --> 19:45.250
Frasier, do you have any idea

19:45.250 --> 19:48.253
how sexy you look in that tux?

19:48.253 --> 19:50.244
Yes, I do.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.258
Alistair...

19:53.258 --> 19:55.260
I'm afraid I may have given you

19:55.260 --> 19:56.762
the wrong impression about myself.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.764
You seem nervous. Don't be.

19:58.764 --> 20:01.266
And I want to thank you for waiting.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.268
Oh, no, the waiting was
good. I enjoyed the waiting.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.771
Oh, me too.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.774
How it sharpens the appetite.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.776
How it builds.

20:10.776 --> 20:13.779
The intensity, the heat, the desire.

20:13.779 --> 20:14.780
Can you feel it?

20:14.780 --> 20:17.783
Oh, yes, there it is.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.273
Alistair, um...

20:22.287 --> 20:23.789
Listen, I-I...

20:23.789 --> 20:26.280
I'm afraid I have to
tell you something, uh...

20:27.292 --> 20:29.294
I'm not gay.

20:29.294 --> 20:30.295
Oh, Frasier, please don't tell me

20:30.295 --> 20:32.297
you're still strugglin
g with those issues.

20:32.297 --> 20:35.801
Well, I-I like you so much,
and I love our friendship.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.804
But I'm afraid I can never
really be more than friends.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.305
Would three weeks on Capri

20:40.305 --> 20:43.297
in Bertolucci's villa change your mind?

20:51.316 --> 20:53.318
It's worth a try.

20:53.318 --> 20:54.808
No, no...

20:55.287 --> 20:58.390
No.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.692
It-it wouldn't. I'm sorry.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.694
(sighs) ; Well, then...

21:02.694 --> 21:04.696
I'm so sorry.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.391
so am I.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.400
Could I ask a small favor of you?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.668
Of course. Anything.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.370
Would you mind staying tonight

21:11.370 --> 21:12.671
until my other guests have gone?

21:12.671 --> 21:15.674
I'd hate my friends to
think I'd been jilted.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.376
Of course.

21:17.376 --> 21:18.677
It won't be very late.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.346
Around about 3:00 it's
down to the core crowd,

21:21.346 --> 21:23.348
and we'll all relax and unwind.

21:23.348 --> 21:24.349
It's after midnight, sir.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.684
shall I fire up the hot tub?

21:25.684 --> 21:27.686
Absolutely.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.381
I'm afraid I don't have a bathing suit.

21:29.688 --> 21:36.355
Then you'll fit right in.
