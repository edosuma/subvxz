Warrior Gum...
the last gum you'll ever need.

01:04.989 --> 01:06.260
Damn.

01:06.330 --> 01:09.460
Dang, that was violent...

01:09.530 --> 01:10.360
and magical.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.900
l'm gonna get me some
of that gum.

01:13.870 --> 01:15.240
How's that gum,
Meatwad?

01:15.300 --> 01:17.240
Mmm. Kicks butt.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.500
The flavor go on and on.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.910
Also, l joined the Marines.

01:21.980 --> 01:22.810
You did what?

01:22.880 --> 01:24.350
l joined the Marines.

01:24.410 --> 01:25.940
Well, that was very
dumb of them to take you.

01:26.020 --> 01:26.910
Yeah, l know.

01:26.980 --> 01:30.350
l can't do one push-up, man,
but they said that's okay.

01:30.420 --> 01:31.480
They'd teach me.

01:31.550 --> 01:34.960
And then they say my face will
see the inside of a toilet

01:35.020 --> 01:39.050
and the inside of a fire-ant
hill and maybe Germany.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.760
But what about
your singing career?

01:40.830 --> 01:43.200
l guess we'll just
have to wait till my...

01:43.270 --> 01:44.290
tour of dookie ends.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.230
Music does not wait.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.130
lt lives on.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.300
l know.

01:48.370 --> 01:49.430
That's what l said.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.840
But my drill sergeant said,
"you don't say that.

01:51.910 --> 01:52.840
You give me 20."

01:52.910 --> 01:54.930
And l couldn't do one,
you understand?

01:55.010 --> 01:56.980
But he said, "that's okay.
We'll teach you."

01:57.050 --> 02:00.540
And then he said my face will
see the inside of a toilet

02:00.620 --> 02:01.840
and the inside of
an anthill and...

02:01.920 --> 02:04.150
Meatwad, Meatwad,
l heard you the first time, okay?

02:04.220 --> 02:05.450
Well, look here, maggot.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.680
You drop your
and grab your socks.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.820
We shipping out in three hours.

02:08.889 --> 02:09.720
We?

02:09.789 --> 02:11.230
Yeah, you, devil dog.

02:11.290 --> 02:12.990
And you, too, fart sack.

02:13.060 --> 02:15.590
'Cause l get a free coupon if l
sign up two of my friends.

02:15.670 --> 02:17.900
This is for
frigging gum.

02:17.970 --> 02:18.930
Gum?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.830
You keep getting Marines and gum
mixed up, man.

02:20.900 --> 02:21.870
Yeah, l know.

02:21.940 --> 02:23.340
l'm gonna pay for it big time, too.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.270
Look, man,
l'll see y'all later.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.270
l'm going to Canada.

02:26.340 --> 02:28.710
Whoa, fart sack,
my maggots and my jarhead and

02:28.780 --> 02:30.640
my leathernecks,
we sit out there

02:30.710 --> 02:33.200
on that wall protecting keyboard
jockeys like you.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.480
You want me on that wall.

02:34.550 --> 02:35.740
You need me on that wall.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.950
No, l don't.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.450
Alright, see you later.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.390
Well, pack your things, maggot.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.150
We going to the Middle East.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.280
Hell, no.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.330
Let's see the Marines try to
take me like this.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.420
Shake, no!

02:49.570 --> 02:50.690
Unbelievable!

02:50.770 --> 02:51.630
They took me like this.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.670
You smoking and
joking with these potatoes

02:53.740 --> 02:55.070
or are you peeling them, maggot?

02:55.140 --> 02:57.160
You want me to
peel root vegetables?

02:57.240 --> 02:59.230
How about l peel this root
vegetable for you?

02:59.310 --> 03:00.740
lt's all l can do to not burst

03:00.810 --> 03:02.840
into masturbation right now as
we speak.

03:02.910 --> 03:04.400
l'm lonely out here, all right?

03:04.480 --> 03:05.780
Very lonely.

03:05.850 --> 03:06.820
Well, my men are hungry.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.440
You peel potatoes or you give me 20.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.820
You don't outrank me.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.180
No, l don't.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.590
l'm, uh, the same rank.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.820
We're both maggots.

03:13.890 --> 03:14.720
What are you reading?

03:14.790 --> 03:17.120
"Seven ways to
make your skin look younger."

03:17.190 --> 03:19.590
l want to read
that after you're done with it.

03:19.660 --> 03:22.530
Private Shake, are you done
peeling them taters,

03:22.600 --> 03:23.530
you maggot?!

03:23.600 --> 03:24.860
Oh, yeah.

03:24.930 --> 03:28.060
Yeah, you can say l'm "well
done" with these potatoes.

03:28.140 --> 03:31.330
And you can kiss my privates.

03:31.410 --> 03:33.430
He said we supposed
to clean this

03:33.510 --> 03:34.740
so good we can eat
out of it.

03:34.810 --> 03:37.400
But l don't think that's what
people are gonna do.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.780
l think people gonna poop in it.

03:38.850 --> 03:40.040
No, l, uh...

03:40.120 --> 03:41.410
l'm pretty sure l heard him say,

03:41.480 --> 03:43.540
"guard this and make sure no
terrorists come out."

03:43.620 --> 03:44.710
No, l remember.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.720
He said clean it so good we can
eat out of it.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.120
Okay, you do that,

03:48.190 --> 03:51.520
and l'm gonna do what l heard,
which is guard it.

03:51.590 --> 03:52.790
And we'll see who is right.

03:52.860 --> 03:54.060
Okay, l'm done.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.760
That's as clean as it's gonna get.

03:55.830 --> 03:57.660
This is not
clean enough.

03:57.730 --> 03:59.830
He said to clean it so we can
eat off of it.

03:59.900 --> 04:00.770
l heard him.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.460
Shut up eat them potatoes.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.200
He said we have to finish them off

04:04.270 --> 04:08.070
so we can grow big and
strong into a hearty M.C.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.080
Killing machine.

04:09.150 --> 04:09.980
Hoo-hah!

04:10.050 --> 04:11.780
Ho-ho-ho.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.410
l get... l get... l get hoo-hah
and Santa Claus mixed up.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.040
Listen, when we dock,

04:16.120 --> 04:17.550
l'm getting a tattoo of an
anaconda

04:17.620 --> 04:19.880
that's coming up out of
my groin region.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.720
lt's gonna say "badass" in
ancient script,

04:22.790 --> 04:24.230
like Egyptian, maybe.

04:24.290 --> 04:25.190
What are you getting?

04:25.260 --> 04:26.590
Well, l want a butterfly

04:26.660 --> 04:29.430
with wispy yellow
wings on my shoulder.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.630
And underneath,
it will say "Sammy"

04:31.700 --> 04:34.470
'Cause l...
l wish that was my name.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.730
Yeah seriously,
when are we getting these tattoos?

04:36.810 --> 04:38.030
Just eat them potatoes.

04:38.110 --> 04:38.940
No.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.480
They make me gassy.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.340
Look, if you mash them,
they'll flush.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.040
No one will have a clue.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.770
Oh, man, they ain't flushing.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.510
Well, press it again.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.810
Obviously, you're not pressing
it hard enough.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.910
This is all snafu.
lt's fubar.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.220
Oh, god,
this ain't working.

04:54.290 --> 04:56.880
Why didn't we go to Canada
like Frylock?

05:04.030 --> 05:07.630
Uh, uh, where am l?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.260
Welcome to Canada, Frylock.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.000
The key to the trap on your head

05:11.070 --> 05:13.800
is implanted in your skull just
behind your right eye.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.070
On the table in front of you

05:15.140 --> 05:17.040
is a grapefruit
and a grapefruit spoon.

05:17.110 --> 05:17.940
Do the math.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.480
Wait, wait, wait!

05:19.550 --> 05:21.310
What's the grapefruit for?

05:21.380 --> 05:22.820
l'm not sure, actually.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.220
l forgot.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.310
You think you could maybe...

05:25.390 --> 05:27.320
grab your jaw and just sort of
rip your head open?

05:27.390 --> 05:29.520
l want to see inside there.
Rip your head open.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.420
We should just
go to Canada right now.

05:31.490 --> 05:32.620
That's a good idea.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.890
lt's not too late, right?

05:33.960 --> 05:35.160
No, l don't think so.

05:35.230 --> 05:36.760
Sure, l mean,
we can go any time.

05:36.830 --> 05:37.660
Why not?

05:37.730 --> 05:39.720
lt ain't like this
is the Marines or nothing.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.170
What? lt's not?

05:41.240 --> 05:42.070
l thought it was.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.010
Well, it ain't.

05:45.070 --> 05:46.060
What the hell?!

05:46.140 --> 05:47.770
lncoming!

05:47.840 --> 05:49.670
Wait, maybe it is.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.040
But either way, l mean,

05:51.110 --> 05:54.240
we should be able to leave if
we're not happy here.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.150
And l'm not.

05:55.220 --> 05:56.980
Yeah, and if
we're not happy,

05:57.050 --> 05:58.540
there's no reason
for us to be around.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.210
Nobody wants somebody
who's not happy.

06:00.290 --> 06:02.050
l don't like being
fired upon.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.750
Do you?
- Of course not.

06:04.830 --> 06:05.820
So we should go.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.520
So, should we tell someone?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.220
Oh, they'll figure it out.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.460
l'll just text them...

06:10.530 --> 06:12.090
from that big wave over there.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.570
Let's go.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.000
Ooh-rah!

06:18.840 --> 06:20.430
Are you enjoying our little game?

06:20.510 --> 06:21.870
Yeah, it's over.
l just took it off.

06:21.940 --> 06:22.770
You have 60 seconds.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.510
Wait, what are you talking about?

06:25.580 --> 06:27.070
l just took it off.
Here it is.

06:27.150 --> 06:27.980
See? Right here.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.350
Oh, wow.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.440
Shoot.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.710
lt was only a twist tie.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.410
From my whole-wheat bread loaf.

06:33.490 --> 06:35.920
You found it. Bring it to me.

06:35.990 --> 06:37.890
You have 60 seconds.

06:37.960 --> 06:38.790
Where are you?

06:38.860 --> 06:39.890
l don't know.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.690
l'm a doll.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.820
Well, hell,
you must be somewhere.

06:42.900 --> 06:43.730
There's a camera on you.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.130
There's a camera on me?

06:45.200 --> 06:46.130
For real?

06:46.200 --> 06:47.790
Well, what do l look like?

06:47.870 --> 06:49.270
Am l pretty?

06:49.340 --> 06:51.030
ls this all y'all do up in Canada?

06:51.110 --> 06:54.980
We speak French... sometimes.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.670
Pretty much this, though.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.410
Look, l'm going back
to the United States, okay?

06:58.480 --> 07:00.680
Wait, um, why don't you, uh,

07:00.750 --> 07:03.380
jam that grapefruit spoon in your eye...
is that cool?

07:03.450 --> 07:05.420
Uh, let me think about that.
No.

07:05.490 --> 07:06.320
Come on, man.

07:06.390 --> 07:11.520
Don't be a dick.
Do it... or else.

07:11.590 --> 07:12.990
Or else what?

07:13.060 --> 07:14.030
Or else that.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.620
See what that did?

07:15.700 --> 07:18.500
What if you were eating that
when that happened?

07:18.570 --> 07:19.800
Nightmare.

07:19.870 --> 07:21.270
l am out of here.

07:21.340 --> 07:22.170
Wait.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.260
That key is still in your head.

07:23.340 --> 07:24.170
No, it's not.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.870
Damn it, just hack
your foot off.

07:25.940 --> 07:27.640
Wait, Frylock.
Come on, don't go.

07:27.710 --> 07:29.370
We have universal health care here.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.780
lt's free if you're a citizen.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.110
Frylock:
Nope. No, thanks.

07:32.180 --> 07:33.340
Come on, man. Hang out.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.780
l'm lonely.

07:34.850 --> 07:37.820
Frylock, we found you!

07:37.890 --> 07:39.910
l missed your beautiful face.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.220
How was Canada?

07:41.290 --> 07:42.280
Canada?

07:42.360 --> 07:43.690
Uh, Canada sucks.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.620
Yeah, so does the Marines.

07:45.690 --> 07:46.560
You know what?

07:46.630 --> 07:48.760
l did not like being confined in
the bowels

07:48.830 --> 07:52.460
of a military ship or
being fired upon by my enemies.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.370
lt sucks, man.

07:53.440 --> 07:57.170
And yet, l love crepes, and horses,

07:57.240 --> 07:59.540
and l certainly
enjoy curling.

07:59.610 --> 08:04.410
You know, Canada may not be for
everyone, but, hell,

08:04.480 --> 08:07.970
l'm willing
to give it a try.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.380
Uh, Canada's over here, Shake.

08:10.450 --> 08:11.280
Where are you going?

08:11.350 --> 08:13.910
l know where Canada is,
all right?!

08:13.990 --> 08:16.720
l'm familiar with it.
l can point to it on a map.

08:16.790 --> 08:17.690
What's in here?

08:17.760 --> 08:18.750
Why don't you go find out?

08:18.830 --> 08:20.060
Okay.

08:20.130 --> 08:21.990
l'll do anything.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.490
Want to play a game?

08:23.570 --> 08:24.860
No, thank you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

08:24.930 --> 08:25.800
Don't go. Don't go.

08:25.870 --> 08:28.000
Come on, man,
l got all the Rush records.

08:28.070 --> 08:29.130
Come on, man, please?

08:29.210 --> 08:31.870
Just come hang out with me.

08:33.610 --> 08:34.440
Damn.

08:34.809 --> 08:36.140
All right, let's go home.

08:36.210 --> 08:37.510
Boy, l can't go back there.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.510
The Marine corps is looking for
me, man.

08:39.580 --> 08:42.280
Let's go somewhere where there's
a TV.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.350
This summer,
take your family to Canada.

08:47.420 --> 08:48.650
Come for the crepes.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.590
Stay for the curling.

08:52.260 --> 08:55.090
Canada...
que sera, sera.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.060
You know,

08:56.130 --> 08:58.760
it kind of makes me think twice
about visiting Canada

08:58.830 --> 09:00.630
after watching that ad.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.540
lt's kind of like they're
promoting the horror

09:03.610 --> 09:05.340
more than
the natural beauty.

09:05.410 --> 09:06.340
Come on, Shake.

09:06.410 --> 09:08.340
TV makes everything look good.

09:08.410 --> 09:09.380
Let's at least look into it.

09:09.450 --> 09:11.910
Aren't y'all, uh,
AWOL?

09:11.980 --> 09:14.950
Aren't you all a-hole,
semper fry,

09:15.020 --> 09:16.140
do or shut up?

09:16.220 --> 09:19.050
Look, l'm just saying,
Shake, it's a law, you know.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.420
Well clearly l fought the law,
and l won.

09:21.490 --> 09:22.510
We did our time.

09:22.590 --> 09:23.850
l served with
much distinction.

09:23.930 --> 09:24.760
Peeling taters.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.490
Look at this serpent.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.760
Looks like a
hamster to me.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.090
l did not pick that one,

09:29.160 --> 09:30.960
and that's why l'm
having it lasered off tomorrow!

09:31.030 --> 09:32.470
l'm born hard!

09:32.530 --> 09:34.590
Yeah, we in huge
trouble with the Marines.

09:34.670 --> 09:37.330
Who l am suing,
l'll have you know...

09:37.410 --> 09:39.770
completely anonymously because
they must not know

09:39.840 --> 09:43.540
where the hell l am at this
juncture in the legal process.

09:43.610 --> 09:45.310
This is the United States
military.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.470
Please step out of the cave
immediately.

09:47.550 --> 09:48.570
You are AWOL.

09:48.650 --> 09:50.140
We are not leaving without you.

09:50.220 --> 09:51.210
Oh, man.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.380
The Marines found us.

09:52.450 --> 09:54.480
Alpha team,
go to night-vision mode.

09:59.430 --> 10:00.520
Oh, yeah, they found us.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.960
God, they're good.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.400
They won't take us
if we're gay.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.330
Hurry... do the YMCA thing.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.230
Seriously?

10:06.300 --> 10:07.130
All right.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.070
You do the "M."

10:08.140 --> 10:10.330
l do not comprehend.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.030
What are you trying
to convey to me?

10:12.110 --> 10:14.370
What the hell are you
Kansas City doing?

10:14.440 --> 10:15.670
They're not buying it!

10:15.740 --> 10:17.680
Look, there's only one friggin'
way out of this.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.150
We got to make out like furied
monkeys.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.180
Hold me in your arms
and kiss me deep.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.080
Let's go.

10:23.150 --> 10:24.880
Stick your tongue
down my throat.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.450
l sure do like this.

10:29.530 --> 10:31.760
Mother of god,
they're gay now!

10:31.830 --> 10:32.690
Let's get out of here!

10:32.760 --> 10:36.420
Everybody, evacuate back to
our wholesome, non-gay base!

10:36.500 --> 10:37.400
Phew.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.690
They're gone.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.230
Hey.
Hey, man, they're gone.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.230
You can get off me now.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.130
Aw, come on, guys.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.030
You're rehashing.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.300
That's the same joke we did in
the movie,

10:44.370 --> 10:46.140
