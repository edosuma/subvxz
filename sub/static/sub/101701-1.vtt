M_I_SForEver

01:05.146 --> 01:09.117
You don't have to do this, please.
Help, somebody help.

01:10.986 --> 01:13.189
Ah, fuck.

01:16.925 --> 01:19.194
Amy!

01:19.227 --> 01:23.899
You are going to burn for
this. Fucking burn.

01:23.932 --> 01:26.135
No!

01:37.078 --> 01:39.414
Let me go.

02:01.036 --> 02:03.272
What's wrong
with you people?

02:03.304 --> 02:06.074
Prepare the sacrifice!

02:24.993 --> 02:29.298
Tonight we welcome our God.

02:55.056 --> 02:59.461
I've got a job for you.
There are two types of knowledge

02:59.493 --> 03:03.898
Screaming!

06:24.365 --> 06:26.701
There are two
types of knowledge.

06:26.735 --> 06:30.605
Explicit and tacit. Explicit
knowledge, one

06:31.038 --> 06:34.375
Explicit knowledge, one person
can explain to another

06:34.408 --> 06:37.245
for example
two plus two equals four,

06:37.511 --> 06:42.350
but tacit knowledge can not be
explained it has to be

06:42.384 --> 06:46.321
experienced first-hand.

06:46.353 --> 06:49.991
can anyone give me an example of
what tacit knowledge would be?

06:50.859 --> 06:53.662
Come on come on somebody's got
an answer.

06:53.694 --> 06:56.564
Yes Brook.

06:56.598 --> 06:58.701
Sex.

07:00.701 --> 07:02.470
Very
elegantly put Brook.

07:02.504 --> 07:05.708
However she
was in fact correct.

07:06.040 --> 07:09.276
Yes, although it is important
that we continue to educate

07:09.309 --> 07:14.281
ourselves we cannot forget the
value of experiencing life

07:14.314 --> 07:16.083
first hand.

07:16.117 --> 07:18.687
That's tacit knowledge everyone.

07:20.287 --> 07:23.225
Don't forget, paper is
due next week.

07:23.258 --> 07:25.560
and Monday we'll be studying
sexual dysfunction,

07:25.593 --> 07:28.196
so try to come.

07:34.134 --> 07:36.237
so, you going to
Seth's party tonight?

07:36.271 --> 07:38.739
Of course.
I hear Jake's gonna be there.

07:38.773 --> 07:40.609
I didn't know you were into him.

07:40.641 --> 07:45.646
I'm not I'm just looking for a
little tacit knowledge.

07:46.314 --> 07:50.486
Besides he has a nice ass
and a hot car.

07:51.518 --> 07:53.321
Whore.

07:53.353 --> 07:55.156
Skank.

07:56.458 --> 08:00.462
Hey,
so what times the party tonight?

08:04.499 --> 08:07.836
Oh my god. Did I just hear
little miss perfect ask if she

08:07.869 --> 08:09.504
wanna go to a party?

08:09.537 --> 08:12.239
Since when have you ever wanted
to go out drinking?

08:12.273 --> 08:15.343
All through high school
I played it safe.

08:15.376 --> 08:17.479
Focused on school.

08:17.511 --> 08:20.715
We're in college now and I don't
wanna look back with regrets

08:21.549 --> 08:23.685
No objections here.

08:24.384 --> 08:28.623
Ladies are you guys
ready to party tonight?

08:29.023 --> 08:31.225
Wouldn't miss it

08:31.593 --> 08:34.529
So how about you guys come to my
house to get ready later?

08:34.561 --> 08:37.465
Yeah me and Jake here will pick
up you beautiful ladies

08:37.498 --> 08:38.799
at around nine.

08:38.832 --> 08:40.868
That would be perfect.

08:40.900 --> 08:44.138
Look forward
to seeing you later.

08:45.806 --> 08:47.575
See ya.

08:48.609 --> 08:49.810
What the hell was that?

08:49.843 --> 08:51.278
What are you talking about?

08:51.311 --> 08:53.747
Keep your eyes
to yourself princess.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.016
Excuse me.

08:55.049 --> 08:58.620
So, how about you guys both come
to my place to get ready at 7pm?

08:58.652 --> 09:00.821
Okay?

09:00.854 --> 09:02.523
What should I wear?

09:02.556 --> 09:04.892
Just show up at Heather's I'll
have something for you

09:04.925 --> 09:06.393
to wear.

09:06.426 --> 09:07.896
Should I be worried?

09:07.929 --> 09:10.265
Just make sure you're
both at my place by 7pm.

09:10.298 --> 09:12.534
Tonight's gonna
rock bitches.

09:42.396 --> 09:45.766
Is it really necessary
to take out all of my clothes?

09:46.534 --> 09:48.237
Yes.

09:49.670 --> 09:52.273
I'm excited you decided
to come out tonight.

09:52.306 --> 09:53.941
It's been way too long.

09:53.974 --> 09:56.344
How time flies.

09:57.045 --> 10:00.681
Come on you guys,
you're my two best friends.

10:00.714 --> 10:03.417
Can you promise me that
you'll try to get along?

10:04.084 --> 10:06.854
I just
wanna have a good time.

10:06.887 --> 10:10.258
Can we call a truce?

10:11.626 --> 10:14.496
Fine. I'll play nice.

10:14.529 --> 10:16.364
Perfect.

10:16.396 --> 10:20.468
But, she has to wear this.

10:28.709 --> 10:31.245
I'm not wearing that.

10:43.591 --> 10:46.761
So,
ready to get lucky.

10:46.794 --> 10:48.963
You know something I don't.

10:48.997 --> 10:52.766
Actually, I hear on good
authority that Brook wants to

10:52.800 --> 10:54.368
get in your pants man.

10:54.401 --> 10:57.973
Yeah well she's,
she's not my type.

11:00.474 --> 11:02.643
What are you talking about,
have you seen her?

11:02.676 --> 11:04.879
I got my eye
on someone else okay.

11:06.613 --> 11:08.583
Maryssa?

11:09.318 --> 11:14.223
Okay, alright you like those
good girl closet type freaks eh?

11:17.525 --> 11:19.627
Get out of the car.

11:32.607 --> 11:33.507
Hey.

11:33.540 --> 11:35.544
Hey.

11:36.410 --> 11:38.313
I love your car.

11:40.948 --> 11:43.251
Wow!

12:02.502 --> 12:05.773
Why do I feel like I should
be standing on a corner?

12:05.806 --> 12:08.442
You look incredible.

12:08.476 --> 12:10.479
Thanks.

12:15.016 --> 12:17.986
Okay. Here come on, guys lets
get this party moving okay.

12:18.019 --> 12:20.389
After you.

12:56.491 --> 12:58.025
Ah, everyone's here.

12:58.059 --> 12:59.727
How you doin man?

12:59.761 --> 13:02.963
Hey hey alright mate, come here.

13:02.997 --> 13:06.001
how was South America man?

13:07.501 --> 13:08.902
Life changing.

13:08.935 --> 13:11.439
Is a, everything okay?

13:11.472 --> 13:15.677
Yeah man, hell of a trip.

13:15.709 --> 13:18.512
Let's get inside,
I got something far

13:18.545 --> 13:21.083
out to show everybody.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.901
Where are the drinks man?

13:42.636 --> 13:45.540
I got a surprise amigo.

13:48.543 --> 13:51.012
When I was in South America
I went with a group of people

13:51.045 --> 13:52.881
to see a shaman.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.484
He introduced us to an ayahuasca
based drug.

13:57.517 --> 14:01.054
A new form of changa that
allowed us to go on a wild

14:01.088 --> 14:03.190
spiritual journey.

14:03.223 --> 14:06.493
It opens your mind to a
whole new level of

14:06.526 --> 14:08.662
consciousness.

14:09.997 --> 14:12.968
Come on man. You know
I can't mess with this shit.

14:13.334 --> 14:16.003
That's the best part man.

14:16.036 --> 14:18.672
It's all natural and the main
ingredient is a chemical

14:18.705 --> 14:21.142
already produced in the brain.

14:21.910 --> 14:26.982
Think of it as
tapping into your third eye.

14:31.549 --> 14:32.686
Oh, I'm in.

14:34.121 --> 14:36.757
Come on baby
it'll be fun.

14:42.229 --> 14:45.199
Okay fine, fine. Alright,
let's do this, okay.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.135
Okay, but if this comes
back to bite me in the ass

14:47.168 --> 14:48.904
I'm gonna kill you.

14:50.804 --> 14:52.774
So how bout it bro?

14:53.141 --> 14:54.876
You say it's okay?

14:55.876 --> 14:58.078
Yeah I'm in.

14:59.981 --> 15:02.150
I don't think so guys.

15:02.183 --> 15:03.684
Oh, come on.

15:03.718 --> 15:06.788
I thought you
wanted to let loose tonight.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.122
It's alright,
you don't have to do it

15:08.155 --> 15:09.624
if you don't feel
comfortable.

15:09.656 --> 15:12.893
Figures miss goody-goody
would chicken out.

15:13.861 --> 15:17.165
Fine. Fuck it let's do this.

15:17.198 --> 15:19.034
Yes.

15:19.699 --> 15:21.770
Alright.

16:00.308 --> 16:01.977
Wannabe.

16:20.126 --> 16:22.830
What a drama queen.

16:24.165 --> 16:26.233
You can be a real bitch.

19:11.499 --> 19:14.035
Jake!

19:14.401 --> 19:16.438
Maryssa!

19:23.376 --> 19:27.315
No, no, no, no,
not now.

19:33.386 --> 19:36.724
Where the hell are you guys?

19:38.459 --> 19:42.097
Maryssa?

19:45.265 --> 19:47.367
Is that really you?

19:50.404 --> 19:54.876
I need, I need you and Jake back
in the other room.

19:58.311 --> 20:03.117
We should, we
should really get back.

20:18.065 --> 20:22.370
Aaahh.

21:13.253 --> 21:15.122
Maryssa!

21:16.522 --> 21:19.026
Maryssa!

21:20.094 --> 21:21.996
Hello.

22:30.396 --> 22:32.433
Maryssa.

22:33.099 --> 22:35.102
Maryssa.

22:36.235 --> 22:38.004
Maryssa.

22:38.038 --> 22:40.040
Maryssa
open the door. Eh.

22:42.608 --> 22:44.913
Maryssa open the door!

22:45.847 --> 22:48.648
Alright stay back.
I'm coming in alright.

22:48.682 --> 22:50.284
No.

22:50.317 --> 22:52.520
Open the door.

22:52.552 --> 22:54.588
Maryssa open the door.

22:54.620 --> 22:57.090
Okay I'm
coming in stay back

22:57.124 --> 22:59.126
Noooo!

23:03.563 --> 23:06.099
What the hell.

23:09.103 --> 23:11.572
What the hell?

23:11.605 --> 23:14.275
You alright? What happened?

23:15.242 --> 23:20.447
I was in this horrible place and
there was this creature

23:21.749 --> 23:25.420
It held me down
and it wouldn't let me go.

23:25.819 --> 23:27.320
You're hallucinating,
alright.

23:27.354 --> 23:28.756
It didn't happen.

23:28.789 --> 23:30.590
It was
so real where did all this blood

23:30.624 --> 23:33.160
Where did all this
blood come from?

23:33.193 --> 23:36.129
Maryssa. Why are you
covered in blood?

23:38.132 --> 23:41.769
I, I dunno I,
I don't think it's mine.

23:49.276 --> 23:51.379
Oh.

23:58.819 --> 24:01.021
What the hell happened?

24:04.223 --> 24:06.193
Brook,
what happened to his face?

24:06.225 --> 24:09.363
I don't know.

24:12.532 --> 24:17.338
No no,
no, it wasn't me it wasn't me.

24:44.330 --> 24:45.732
What do we have here?

24:45.765 --> 24:47.634
It's a hell of a mess.

24:47.667 --> 24:49.771
Sounds
like drugs are involved.

24:56.242 --> 24:59.379
What kind of bath
salt shit is this?

26:44.952 --> 26:46.953
Good morning everyone.

26:46.986 --> 26:51.391
I uh, I know we're all aware of
the,

26:51.425 --> 26:55.695
um, the tragedy that happened to
one of your classmates

26:56.495 --> 26:59.732
I've been
asked to remind you that there

26:59.765 --> 27:03.603
are counselors available at the
school if you need anyone to

27:03.636 --> 27:08.643
talk to I will also be available
to talk or anything right so uh,

27:13.680 --> 27:16.483
two ten please.
Books to two ten.

27:16.515 --> 27:18.551
Get started.

27:39.373 --> 27:41.709
It's time to take your pills.

27:56.723 --> 27:59.226
Mouth open.

28:00.926 --> 28:02.963
Okay.

28:46.906 --> 28:49.443
This is fucked.

28:50.911 --> 28:51.812
Please don't.

28:51.846 --> 28:53.847
Who invited the
psycho chick anyways man?

28:53.879 --> 28:56.617
Hey! This isn't the
time or the place.

28:56.649 --> 29:00.320
Really then when's the right
time or place to discuss this?

29:01.922 --> 29:04.091
There's enough
blame to go around.

29:04.124 --> 29:07.528
I worked my
ass off to get here okay.

29:08.261 --> 29:10.664
I'm no math wiz,
I'm no English scholar.

29:10.696 --> 29:12.498
I play football,
that's all I know.

29:12.531 --> 29:14.534
We'll find a way.

29:16.036 --> 29:19.106
You don't understand my parents
can't afford to take me to

29:19.138 --> 29:22.542
school kay, they're
relying on me for this

29:29.816 --> 29:32.553
Whatever I'm gonna
go talk to coach,

29:32.586 --> 29:34.822
see if I can
salvage my scholarship.

29:39.059 --> 29:41.695
I can't stay here.

29:42.462 --> 29:43.629
I can take you home.

29:43.663 --> 29:48.035
No. I just wanna
be alone right now.

29:56.076 --> 29:58.112
I guess that
just leaves us then.

30:00.914 --> 30:03.451
I gotta go.

30:08.120 --> 30:11.023
You wouldn't let a
girl walk home feeling all alone

30:11.057 --> 30:13.694
and vulnerable would you?

30:14.594 --> 30:16.463
Are you serious?

30:16.495 --> 30:18.998
After everything
that's happened do you ever

30:19.031 --> 30:22.535
Do you think about anyone
but yourself?

30:32.913 --> 30:34.915
Maryssa?

30:58.838 --> 31:02.608
Calm down, calm down.
It's okay, it's okay.

31:02.642 --> 31:06.180
What's going on?
Are you okay?

31:16.223 --> 31:19.426
Coach!

31:34.573 --> 31:37.444
Is anyone in here?

32:43.976 --> 32:45.812
Come on.

33:12.271 --> 33:17.278
I've always commended
humanity's drive to compete

33:26.853 --> 33:31.859
However, even
Achilles had a weakness.

33:55.248 --> 33:58.919
What are you?
What are you?

34:00.686 --> 34:04.791
I am what hell fears.

34:27.379 --> 34:30.050
Orderly restrain her.

34:30.081 --> 34:33.953
Ma'am please calm down.

34:38.456 --> 34:41.060
Get her up on the bed.

34:51.203 --> 34:55.007
Tyson, I'm so sorry.

35:24.437 --> 35:26.406
Please help me
to understand something

35:26.439 --> 35:29.009
I have two dead students that
were killed in ways

35:29.042 --> 35:32.846
I've never seen before a
suspect, near catatonic

35:32.879 --> 35:36.383
in an asylum, that couldn't have
committed the second murder.

35:36.415 --> 35:38.685
What
the hell is going on?

35:41.955 --> 35:44.357
I saw Maryssa earlier that day.

35:44.390 --> 35:47.961
You, saw Miss
Clarke earlier that day?

35:49.394 --> 35:51.097
Yes.

35:51.698 --> 35:54.468
I find that very hard to
believe considering she's been

35:54.501 --> 35:57.838
under constant supervision since
she arrived at the asylum.

36:00.106 --> 36:04.278
Now
what's really going on here?

36:12.417 --> 36:13.854
Hey!

36:13.886 --> 36:18.024
You know the routine,
don't leave town.

36:20.426 --> 36:22.863
Let's go talk to Maryssa.

36:51.457 --> 36:53.127
Woah.

36:53.493 --> 36:54.962
Sorry.

36:58.564 --> 37:03.771
It's not you. My mind
was somewhere else.

37:06.506 --> 37:08.575
Are you sure
it's a good idea to go see her?

37:08.607 --> 37:10.443
I need answers.

37:10.475 --> 37:12.412
I saw Maryssa
around the time Tyson died,

37:12.444 --> 37:15.381
yet according to the detective
she's been locked away.

37:15.414 --> 37:17.817
Did you
actually see her?

37:17.850 --> 37:20.019
What's that
supposed to mean?

37:20.053 --> 37:23.957
I'm just saying
you seem to have it out for her.

37:24.957 --> 37:28.961
Prince charming to the rescue.

37:31.196 --> 37:34.600
Does that make you feel better
taking shots at people?

37:34.633 --> 37:36.969
How
little do you think of me?

37:37.002 --> 37:40.240
Since when do you care what
anyone thinks?

37:48.548 --> 37:50.917
I'm sorry.

37:51.785 --> 37:54.555
I just don't understand
what you have against Maryssa.

38:02.461 --> 38:06.465
Heather is my only real friend.

38:07.265 --> 38:09.401
Her and Maryssa grew up
together, so whenever

38:09.435 --> 38:12.873
I'm around...

38:13.673 --> 38:15.943
I just
feel like the third wheel.

38:17.977 --> 38:20.013
She has the perfect life.

38:20.046 --> 38:21.615
No ones perfect.

38:23.548 --> 38:26.219
She's good enough for you.

38:59.551 --> 39:01.588
Who are you?

39:04.222 --> 39:08.527
What's the matter don't you
recognize yourself?

39:08.560 --> 39:10.463
Who are you?

39:10.495 --> 39:13.133
So demanding!

39:13.165 --> 39:18.138
I descend from
a darkness long forgotten.

39:18.171 --> 39:22.107
I caused the fall of
the angels, the creation of

39:22.140 --> 39:26.578
demons, I am Belial.

39:26.611 --> 39:29.115
Please, don't hurt me.

39:29.147 --> 39:31.184
Why won't
you leave me alone.

39:31.216 --> 39:35.955
You are my deliverer. I've been
imprisoned in the bowels

39:35.988 --> 39:39.358
of hell for an eternity.

39:39.392 --> 39:42.930
Until
you came along.

39:43.430 --> 39:47.334
Now I'll show
this world true evil.

39:47.367 --> 39:50.736
If I'm the one that freed
you then leave my friends alone.

39:50.769 --> 39:54.507
Your friends think
you're a killer.

39:57.642 --> 40:00.579
I will continue
to kill your friends

40:00.613 --> 40:03.415
and consume their souls.

40:03.448 --> 40:08.088
No, no, no.

40:11.691 --> 40:13.694
That's enough!

40:15.127 --> 40:17.430
There are
people here to see you if you

40:17.463 --> 40:21.401
can refrain from another
outburst, I will allow it.

40:21.434 --> 40:24.403
Nod, if you have an
understanding.

40:37.617 --> 40:41.521
We uh, we have some
bad news about Tyson.

40:44.756 --> 40:47.426
He was
found torn apart at the school.

40:49.629 --> 40:51.431
How do you know that?

40:51.464 --> 40:56.470
I had a visitor today. A
creature called Belial.

41:00.372 --> 41:03.309
When we did the drug, we
opened a gateway between his

41:03.341 --> 41:07.646
world and ours. Now
he's gonna kill us off.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.750
One by one.

41:11.383 --> 41:13.152
There's no creature.

41:14.120 --> 41:18.625
We've all been through something
traumatic, its just your mind

41:18.658 --> 41:20.060
trying to cope.

41:20.093 --> 41:21.493
Speak for yourself.

41:21.526 --> 41:24.363
Something came after me,
and it looked like you.

41:24.763 --> 41:27.700
Somehow,
the creature and I are linked.

41:28.468 --> 41:32.539
I watched through the creatures
eyes each time he's come after

41:32.571 --> 41:34.374
one of you.

41:34.406 --> 41:39.345
I watched Seth
and Tyson die.

41:39.377 --> 41:42.348
And there was nothing
I could do about it.

41:44.550 --> 41:47.453
Do you hear yourselves?
You sound-

41:47.486 --> 41:49.289
Crazy?

41:52.658 --> 41:53.760
I, I don't...

41:53.792 --> 41:55.227
What are we gonna do?

41:55.827 --> 42:00.300
Find out whatever you can about,
Belial we need to learn more

42:00.332 --> 42:02.334
about what we're dealing with.

42:04.202 --> 42:07.773
I will, try to find a
way out of here.

42:18.651 --> 42:20.587
Hang in there.

42:42.707 --> 42:46.646
You don't understand my
friends are in danger.

42:46.678 --> 42:48.381
They're going to die.

42:48.680 --> 42:50.516
I agree.

42:51.716 --> 42:52.885
What did you say?

42:52.917 --> 42:57.789
You and your friends opened a
gateway to Belial's realm.

42:57.823 --> 43:01.361
And now you are
his link to this world.

43:03.662 --> 43:05.498
How do you know that?

43:06.399 --> 43:10.502
If he collects enough souls
he'll be freed into this world

43:10.535 --> 43:12.804
and bring
his followers with him.

43:12.838 --> 43:14.406
I'm sorry, we, we didn't know.

43:14.439 --> 43:17.309
Your stupidity
will bring hell on earth.

43:24.517 --> 43:26.819
What can I do to stop him?

43:27.153 --> 43:31.825
The only way to stop Belial, is
to sever the link.

43:32.492 --> 43:36.696
So in other words I have to die.

43:39.731 --> 43:41.733
Not necessarily.

43:41.767 --> 43:45.672
There is a ritual you can do,
but time is running out.

43:45.937 --> 43:50.209
Once Belial has enough souls
he'll be able to come to this

43:50.243 --> 43:51.811
world at will.

43:51.843 --> 43:55.481
Here's a list of
ingredients and instructions.

43:55.513 --> 43:58.251
You'll also
have to distract Belial.

43:58.984 --> 44:03.189
Once the ritual begins,
he will know.

44:06.459 --> 44:08.361
Are you an angel?

44:13.265 --> 44:18.271
There are many realms and gods,
you primitive hairless ape.

45:03.082 --> 45:05.984
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
believe you back there, but,

45:06.017 --> 45:10.423
God,
demons, other dimensions.

45:11.055 --> 45:14.327
You didn't take the drug, you
didn't see what I did.

45:14.359 --> 45:15.727
I'm trying.

45:15.760 --> 45:17.997
Feels like judging.

45:20.031 --> 45:25.037
Look, we've all lost a lot and
you're right, I don't know what

45:26.104 --> 45:28.407
you're going through.

45:29.542 --> 45:33.546
I'm here I'm not going anywhere.

45:35.981 --> 45:39.285
I won't let anything
happen to you.

45:50.028 --> 45:53.032
Hey. I think
you found something.

45:53.432 --> 45:56.068
Come on, take a look

46:01.506 --> 46:03.842
It says here that Belial
was the angel that convinced

46:03.876 --> 46:06.345
Lucifer to
rise against God.

46:07.013 --> 46:09.015
He then later turned on Lucifer
in hell because he did

46:09.048 --> 46:11.984
not believe Lucifer was worthy
enough to follow.

46:14.086 --> 46:17.557
He's the angel of
darkness and those that followed

46:17.589 --> 46:21.428
him were known
as the angels of destruction.

46:22.194 --> 46:25.131
Okay so he's the
worst of the worst.

46:25.164 --> 46:27.834
It is prophesied that he will
come to this world and be

46:27.867 --> 46:31.338
known as the anti-christ.

46:52.425 --> 46:54.493
Jake.

47:12.711 --> 47:13.913
Brook!

47:13.946 --> 47:15.481
Brook!

47:15.513 --> 47:18.517
Hey, hey, hey.
Brook!

47:21.019 --> 47:22.554
Wake up.

47:32.897 --> 47:35.734
It's okay.

47:42.508 --> 47:45.145
Maryssa.

47:47.146 --> 47:48.914
Great timing.

47:48.948 --> 47:51.818
I'm sorry did I interrupt
something?

47:53.818 --> 47:54.920
How did you get out?

47:54.953 --> 47:56.222
Someone helped me.

47:56.254 --> 47:57.490
Brook are you okay?

47:57.522 --> 47:59.524
I'll survive.

47:59.557 --> 48:01.193
Wait, what do
you mean somebody helped you?

48:01.227 --> 48:03.830
Listen I can explain
everything on the way.

48:03.863 --> 48:08.701
I have a plan to defeat Belial
but I will need your help.

48:09.301 --> 48:11.638
We need the items on
this list.

48:13.805 --> 48:15.574
I have some of this stuff here.

48:15.607 --> 48:17.609
Yeah, the rest we can pick up.

48:17.642 --> 48:18.877
What do you need this stuff for?

48:18.910 --> 48:20.512
A ritual.

48:20.546 --> 48:21.747
Belial's bound to me.

48:21.781 --> 48:24.750
The person who helped me escape
told me how to sever the link.

48:24.783 --> 48:27.653
And you believed him?

48:27.685 --> 48:30.789
If you have a better solution,
I'd like to hear it.

48:32.758 --> 48:34.694
I'm gonna need to change.

48:34.727 --> 48:37.062
You can change in my room.

48:38.030 --> 48:39.631
Wait,
what was his name again?

48:39.664 --> 48:41.700
He didn't say.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.203
Right.

50:00.011 --> 50:02.147
Well, this is awkward.

50:06.017 --> 50:08.820
I owe you an apology.

50:08.854 --> 50:13.091
I was a jerk before, not
believing you and Maryssa.

50:13.124 --> 50:14.960
Yeah, you were.

50:15.760 --> 50:16.928
I'm sorry.

50:16.961 --> 50:19.230
I'm over it.

50:19.263 --> 50:21.099
It's just that..

50:21.133 --> 50:23.736
Just stop talking.

50:36.015 --> 50:37.950
Uh, we got
everything we could here.

50:37.982 --> 50:39.885
Good,
we'll get the rest on the way.

50:39.917 --> 50:42.354
You look, different.

50:42.388 --> 50:45.658
I've been through hell.

51:13.419 --> 51:14.687
Here are the supplies.

51:14.720 --> 51:15.855
Perfect.

51:15.888 --> 51:18.090
Okay, explain
this plan to me again.

51:18.122 --> 51:20.191
Okay, we
go back to Seth's house.

51:20.225 --> 51:23.328
You guys will do the ritual and
I'll distract Belial.

51:23.961 --> 51:25.697
And how do you
plan on doing that?

51:25.731 --> 51:27.867
I will retake the drug.

51:27.899 --> 51:28.867
Are you nuts?

51:28.901 --> 51:29.836
Do you have a better idea?

51:29.868 --> 51:31.269
Okay listen,
let's just get Heather and then

51:31.303 --> 51:32.271
we can discuss it later.

51:32.303 --> 51:33.271
What's to discuss?

51:33.305 --> 51:34.807
I'm just saying.

51:34.839 --> 51:36.175
We're not going
back to that house.

51:36.207 --> 51:37.276
I didn't say that we should.

51:37.309 --> 51:38.843
Okay, don't you guys get it?

51:38.877 --> 51:43.883
The longer we wait the more
change that, that...

51:44.883 --> 51:46.085
What's wrong?

51:46.118 --> 51:47.853
We need to get to
Heather, Now!

51:47.885 --> 51:49.254
Hurry!

52:21.787 --> 52:24.323
Hello.

52:47.812 --> 52:49.749
Heather!

52:53.818 --> 52:56.088
Tyson?

53:00.926 --> 53:03.496
Come to me.

53:10.935 --> 53:13.939
I missed you so much.

53:14.472 --> 53:18.143
Join me. Be with me.

53:19.477 --> 53:21.914
I don't know how.

53:42.533 --> 53:45.872
What, no kiss?

53:48.240 --> 53:52.345
He calls for you while
he suffers all alone.

53:54.078 --> 53:58.551
I'll unite you,
for all of eternity.

54:00.352 --> 54:02.421
No!

54:08.193 --> 54:12.531
Take your life child,
and be with him.

54:14.031 --> 54:16.035
No. I can't.

54:20.472 --> 54:22.908
That's it.

54:29.881 --> 54:34.053
There's only one way
you'll ever see him again.

54:36.655 --> 54:38.557
That's it.

54:38.990 --> 54:44.196
One thrust is all it takes and
the pain starts to melt away.

54:47.432 --> 54:48.868
I can't.

54:48.901 --> 54:51.904
As you speak
he screams your name.

54:51.937 --> 54:54.574
I can't do it.

54:55.540 --> 55:00.213
There there, you
look like you could use a hug.

55:08.053 --> 55:11.624
Pain is merely a form of
pleasure, which you will learn

55:11.656 --> 55:15.026
to embrace.

55:24.002 --> 55:25.371
Heather!

55:25.403 --> 55:27.071
It's okay, it's okay.

55:27.104 --> 55:28.673
No, no no no.

55:28.707 --> 55:30.676
Heather.

55:30.709 --> 55:32.243
Please, no.

55:32.276 --> 55:33.444
Heather.

55:33.477 --> 55:35.481
No, please, no.

55:38.082 --> 55:40.485
We're too late.

55:41.586 --> 55:44.156
Please, no. Please.

55:47.725 --> 55:50.363
Let's continue on.

56:51.423 --> 56:54.392
okay, let's keep going.

57:02.133 --> 57:05.437
If Seth has any more
of that drug, it'll be in here.

57:13.745 --> 57:16.115
You can always count on
Seth to have what you need.

57:16.147 --> 57:17.515
Is it there?

57:21.452 --> 57:22.720
Got 'em.

57:22.754 --> 57:25.691
Okay, let's
get set up.

57:34.499 --> 57:38.236
Okay remember once I take the
drug, time is of the essence.

57:38.269 --> 57:39.271
If Belial figures out
what were-

57:39.303 --> 57:41.339
We know what we need to do.

57:43.207 --> 57:46.077
Adrenaline, in case we
need it.

57:49.714 --> 57:51.450
Are you sure?

57:51.482 --> 57:54.319
We need it for the ritual.

58:19.611 --> 58:22.147
So gross.

58:27.151 --> 58:29.421
Good luck.

58:34.792 --> 58:36.528
Give 'em hell.

58:39.798 --> 58:42.267
I'll distract
him as long as I can.

58:43.301 --> 58:45.304
Be careful.

58:52.510 --> 58:55.346
Here goes nothing.

59:06.290 --> 59:08.327
Let's get started.

01:02:26.591 --> 01:02:31.597
Aperta portae inferi
ut transiret.

01:02:32.731 --> 01:02:35.466
Oh my God.

01:02:38.403 --> 01:02:41.040
Well don't stop,
we have to keep going.

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:43.542
Police, don't move.

01:02:44.175 --> 01:02:46.845
It's a, it's
not what it looks like.

01:02:46.877 --> 01:02:49.414
Not what it looks like, you
devil worshiping Bonnie and

01:02:49.446 --> 01:02:50.649
Clyde little fucks.

01:02:50.682 --> 01:02:51.750
Look, we can explain.

01:02:51.783 --> 01:02:54.353
Enough! I knew there was
something wrong with you,

01:02:54.385 --> 01:02:55.353
back away from the girl.

01:02:55.386 --> 01:02:56.187
You don't understand.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.722
You have the right to
remain silent-

01:02:57.756 --> 01:02:58.824
She needs our help.

01:02:58.856 --> 01:02:59.724
one more word-

01:02:59.758 --> 01:03:01.393
if you don't stop we're all
gonna die.

01:03:01.426 --> 01:03:04.096
One more word
and I will shoot you!

01:03:26.484 --> 01:03:29.888
So, you gonna shoot me
or make me part of your sick

01:03:29.921 --> 01:03:30.955
sacrifice.

01:03:30.988 --> 01:03:34.792
I don't wanna kill
you, but I will if I have to.

01:03:38.696 --> 01:03:40.699
Finish the ritual.

01:03:57.214 --> 01:04:00.419
So gross.

01:05:00.879 --> 01:05:02.781
Hello?

01:05:03.214 --> 01:05:05.484
Is somebody there?

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.956
Heather?

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.096
How is this possible?

01:05:19.129 --> 01:05:21.966
I escaped.

01:05:21.999 --> 01:05:24.669
Where is
Seth and Tyson?

01:05:25.769 --> 01:05:28.906
Tyson, your boyfriend.

01:05:30.707 --> 01:05:33.479
I found a way out.

01:05:34.245 --> 01:05:39.017
Wait Heather, Heather, Heather!

01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:51.864
Slow down. Heather!

01:05:59.037 --> 01:06:02.140
Heather.

01:06:16.687 --> 01:06:18.990
How did we get here?

01:06:19.022 --> 01:06:22.693
Don't worry, you're safe.

01:06:24.629 --> 01:06:27.232
You
have nothing left to fear.

01:06:31.803 --> 01:06:34.071
Is this some kind of dream?

01:06:34.104 --> 01:06:38.075
Relax.

01:06:44.281 --> 01:06:48.252
Stop. What are you doing?

01:06:49.287 --> 01:06:52.591
Stop it. Please.

01:07:07.972 --> 01:07:10.309
Where are you going?

01:07:21.352 --> 01:07:24.022
Just let go.

01:07:24.055 --> 01:07:26.925
We have so many
wonders to show you.

01:08:48.772 --> 01:08:53.310
Belial! Where are you?

01:08:55.879 --> 01:09:00.084
Welcome back child.

01:09:09.926 --> 01:09:14.933
To what do I owe the pleasure?

01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:19.703
I've come to free the
souls of my friends.

01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:24.075
Is that so.

01:09:26.444 --> 01:09:29.113
Yes!

01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:39.957
What do you have
to offer in return?

01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:42.394
You can take me instead.

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:48.232
You would give up yourself
so willingly?

01:09:48.265 --> 01:09:50.035
Yes.

01:09:53.037 --> 01:09:57.042
You are the anchor.

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:04.316
As long as you live,
you will bring me souls.

01:10:08.151 --> 01:10:13.158
Besides, that's not why
you're really here is it?

01:10:17.227 --> 01:10:18.428
What do you mean?

01:10:18.462 --> 01:10:22.399
You thought you could distract
me while your friends performed

01:10:22.432 --> 01:10:26.537
While your friends
performed their ritual. I have

01:10:28.338 --> 01:10:32.209
I have existed for an eternity.

01:10:32.776 --> 01:10:37.281
Did you really think
you could fool me?

01:10:38.481 --> 01:10:42.386
Their souls belong to me now.

01:10:44.154 --> 01:10:49.160
However, if you're so
determined to see your friends

01:10:52.596 --> 01:10:56.200
Then so be it.

01:11:06.543 --> 01:11:09.346
No.

01:11:35.172 --> 01:11:39.177
A taste of
what's to come.

01:11:40.578 --> 01:11:44.082
No, no stop it.

01:11:44.915 --> 01:11:49.253
They have you to
thank for their fate.

01:11:53.156 --> 01:11:57.361
My friends will finish the
ritual and you will rot here.

01:12:01.097 --> 01:12:06.104
Did you really
think the ritual would help you?

01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:15.445
What do you mean?

01:12:15.479 --> 01:12:19.950
The ritual will
break the veil between two

01:12:19.984 --> 01:12:24.990
worlds and we will
bring endless suffering.

01:12:34.297 --> 01:12:37.167
No, no.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.207
You really shouldn't talk to
strangers little girl.

01:13:11.635 --> 01:13:13.204
Don't Stop.

01:13:13.236 --> 01:13:15.406
There's only one
way you can help her now.

01:13:19.176 --> 01:13:24.048
Per dominum nostrum jesum
christum mundi per dominum

01:13:26.150 --> 01:13:31.156
nostrum Jesum christum mundi
sacrificii copulari.

01:13:39.696 --> 01:13:42.100
You're both
gonna burn in hell.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.704
I couldn't agree more.

01:13:48.506 --> 01:13:50.307
Finish it.

01:13:52.176 --> 01:13:57.182
Veni inquit
diaboli et manifestabo,

01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:05.356
Veni inquit diaboli et
manifestabo!

01:14:16.167 --> 01:14:19.070
You've doomed us all!

01:14:40.658 --> 01:14:45.597
Foolish boy, you
have damned your world.

01:14:57.842 --> 01:15:00.078
Maryssa!

01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:02.212
Jake

01:15:02.245 --> 01:15:05.182
No. Get the hell off me!

01:15:13.223 --> 01:15:18.229
My fallen brethren, we have
been imprisoned for far too

01:15:20.297 --> 01:15:25.303
long. It is time we rise!

01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:30.440
And
bring suffering to the race he

01:15:30.473 --> 01:15:35.480
chose over us. Rise!

01:15:35.712 --> 01:15:40.549
Rise my brothers. Rise!

01:15:41.552 --> 01:15:43.755
Brook!

01:15:54.664 --> 01:15:58.602
Embrace the horror child.

01:15:59.169 --> 01:16:03.675
All of this was
made possible by you.

01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:24.162
The only way to stop him is
to sever the link.

01:16:25.428 --> 01:16:27.431
Stop her!

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:36.207
No!

01:16:46.449 --> 01:16:49.287
This is not possible!

01:16:52.756 --> 01:16:56.160
I will not be defeated.

01:16:56.461 --> 01:17:00.832
No! No!

01:17:20.784 --> 01:17:24.955
No, no. Maryssa.
Maryssa!

01:17:28.758 --> 01:17:30.794
No, your not gonna die.

01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:34.798
Come back to us.

01:17:35.966 --> 01:17:37.501
Wake up!

01:17:37.534 --> 01:17:40.371
Move!

01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:54.586
Maryssa.

01:17:58.689 --> 01:18:00.557
I'm glad you're okay.

01:18:04.595 --> 01:18:06.564
I
thought we'd lost you.

01:18:07.664 --> 01:18:12.436
Hey, where
do you think you're going?

01:18:22.812 --> 01:18:24.882
Glad you're okay.

01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:37.729
Is somebody gonna help me up
here or-

01:18:38.729 --> 01:18:40.897
Let's get out of here.

01:18:40.931 --> 01:18:43.934
Are you sure, I mean I
could leave you guys here if you

01:18:43.967 --> 01:18:46.037
need some alone time.

01:18:50.074 --> 01:18:53.278
I think I likes her better when
she was dead.

01:18:54.345 --> 01:18:56.547
Come on.

01:19:39.957 --> 01:19:43.361
Six more bodies
washed up on shore today.

01:19:44.828 --> 01:19:47.897
This comes after a cargo ship
was found abandoned just

01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:50.901
off the coast
earlier this week.

01:19:58.809 --> 01:20:00.910
In what
has become an all too familiar

01:20:00.944 --> 01:20:05.915
scene emergency crews are now
cleaning up after the most

01:20:05.949 --> 01:20:08.986
recent attack on domestic soil.

01:20:09.919 --> 01:20:14.658
It is the third attack in as
many weeks and no one has yet

01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:17.561
taken responsibility.

01:20:18.495 --> 01:20:23.033
A local community is devastated
after their church became the

01:20:23.065 --> 01:20:27.837
most recent victim of increasing
religious hate crimes around the

01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:32.877
globe. Fifteen are dead and one
remains in hospital for

01:20:34.744 --> 01:20:36.913
observation.

01:20:37.614 --> 01:20:41.051
Heat continues to
grow on government leaders for

01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:45.889
action as many are turning to
the church for answers.

01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:51.863
The vatican has yet to comment.

01:21:53.589 --> 01:21:56.092
Quetzalcoatl.

01:22:00.998 --> 01:22:02.633
Subtle.

01:22:03.699 --> 01:22:07.504
I was feeling a little homesick.

01:22:12.275 --> 01:22:15.979
Why do you hide your true form?

01:22:16.012 --> 01:22:18.716
Humans are easier to manipulate

01:22:18.748 --> 01:22:21.551
when
they're not cowering in terror.

01:22:23.986 --> 01:22:27.790
Perhaps.

01:22:27.824 --> 01:22:31.128
You let the ritual fail.

01:22:31.962 --> 01:22:37.068
I am free that is
all that matters.

01:22:38.569 --> 01:22:41.772
You promised us an army.

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.043
Try and hold yourself together.

01:22:46.443 --> 01:22:49.613
You will have your army.

01:22:49.645 --> 01:22:53.984
This is just the beginning.
