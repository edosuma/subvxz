WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.434
(siren wails)

00:03.434 --> 00:06.006
(mutters indistinctly)

00:06.006 --> 00:07.178
OH!

00:07.178 --> 00:09.009
(whispers) LET'S SEE. MAYBE...

00:10.081 --> 00:12.143
(gasps)
(woman) OHH.

00:12.143 --> 00:13.244
CRAP.

00:13.244 --> 00:14.615
(Callie) DOCTORS NEVER MEAN
TO SCREW UP.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.217
(monitor beeping rapidly)
CRAP, CRAP, CRAP. CRAP!

00:16.217 --> 00:17.618
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO CALL FOR--
CRAP, CRAP, CRAP.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.789
NO! THERE'S NO TIME.

00:18.789 --> 00:20.691
YOU MAKE A BAD CALL, AND...

00:20.691 --> 00:22.553
THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS.

00:22.553 --> 00:23.694
CAN I HELP YOU?
(packaging crinkles)

00:23.694 --> 00:25.126
UH... (clears throat)
(box thuds)

00:25.126 --> 00:27.128
YEAH, DO YOU HAVE ANY
JUST, UM, REGULAR PANTY HOSE?

00:27.128 --> 00:29.260
(woman) WE CAN'T DO THAT.
WELL, WE HAVE TO. LAP PADS!

00:29.260 --> 00:31.262
BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T--
I DON'T CARE!
WE'RE CLOSING HIM UP.

00:31.262 --> 00:34.165
ZERO VICRYL.
ZERO VICRYL NOW.

00:34.165 --> 00:35.806
AM I NOT BEING CLEAR? WHY DO YOU
LOOK SO CONFUSED? WHY--

00:35.806 --> 00:38.139
WHAT ABOUT THESE?
THEY'RE POPULAR. THEY SHIMMER.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.640
NO. NO, NO SHIMMER.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.442
NO FOOTLESS TIGHTS

00:41.442 --> 00:42.573
OR FREAKY LITTLE
TOE SOCK THINGIES.

00:42.573 --> 00:44.775
I JUST--I JUST WANT PANTY HOSE,
BASIC NUDE.

00:44.775 --> 00:46.417
I USED TO BUY THEM
AT THE GROCERY STORE.

00:46.417 --> 00:48.579
THEY COME--THEY COME IN A LITTLE
PLASTIC EGG KIND OF PANTY HOSE!

00:48.579 --> 00:49.750
THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT I NEED!

00:49.750 --> 00:51.752
IS THAT REALLY SO HARD
TO UNDERSTAND?!

00:51.752 --> 00:53.224
IT'S NOT LIKE WE DO IT
ON PURPOSE.

00:53.224 --> 00:55.556
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WANT
TO HURT ANYONE.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.088
BUT SOMETIMES WE DO.

00:57.088 --> 00:58.489
SOMETIMES WE MAKE MISTAKES.

00:58.489 --> 01:00.060
I'M...

01:00.060 --> 01:01.562
(sighs deeply)
I'M SORRY.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.195
AND WHEN WE BLOW IT,
WE'RE SORRY.

01:04.195 --> 01:05.636
THAT WAS--THAT WAS
INAPPROPRIATE.

01:05.636 --> 01:07.098
I'M... (sighs deeply)

01:07.098 --> 01:08.769
I'M JUST--I'M UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW,

01:08.769 --> 01:10.641
AND I HAVE A REALLY BIG DAY
TOMORROW.

01:10.641 --> 01:12.443
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S FINE.

01:12.443 --> 01:14.505
THESE ARE--THESE ARE--
THESE ARE FINE. THESE ARE GREAT.

01:14.505 --> 01:16.347
ACTUALLY, I'LL TAKE ALL THESE.

01:16.347 --> 01:17.808
I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA TAKE 'EM ALL.

01:17.808 --> 01:19.310
REALLY?
YEAH.

01:19.310 --> 01:20.481
JUST, UH, RING ME UP.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.153
EVEN THESE, THE ONES WITH
THE RHINESTONES?

01:22.153 --> 01:24.084
EVEN THOSE. (laughs)
OKAY.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.856
NOT THAT BEING SORRY
REALLY MATTERS.

01:25.856 --> 01:27.358
NOT ANYMORE.

01:27.358 --> 01:29.390
NO APOLOGY IN THE WORLD
MATTERS NOW.

01:29.390 --> 01:33.464
BRAIN MAPPING IS NOT
AN EXACT SCIENCE YET.

01:33.464 --> 01:36.167
BUT THIS ARRAY BRINGS US
ONE STEP CLOSER.

01:36.167 --> 01:38.569
DR. TORRES AND I HAVE HAD
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS SO FAR,

01:38.569 --> 01:40.371
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,

01:40.371 --> 01:42.503
WE ARE MOVING
FROM AN ANIMATED HAND

01:42.503 --> 01:44.705
TO A ROBOTIC ONE.
(murmuring)

01:44.705 --> 01:46.877
OH, SHE'S ON THE STAGE.
I'M SORRY, SIR. ARE YOU LOST?

01:46.877 --> 01:49.440
SORRY. I'M LOOKING FOR...
DR. TORRES?

01:49.440 --> 01:50.441
YES. HI.

01:50.441 --> 01:52.183
GREAT. YOU'RE BEING SUED.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.545
(murmuring)
LOVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE,
BY THE WAY.

01:54.545 --> 01:57.188
ROBOT HANDS. (chuckles) FREAKY!

01:57.188 --> 01:58.149
(lowered voice)
WHO IS THAT FROM?

01:58.149 --> 01:59.350
(Callie) TRAVIS REED?
(Cristina) UH-HUH.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.851
AS IN THE TRAVIS REED,
THE SNOWBOARDER?

02:00.851 --> 02:02.653
UH, HE NEEDS A NEW HIP.

02:02.653 --> 02:03.794
I TOLD HIM HE WANTS YOU.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.156
WAIT. HOW DO YOU EVEN
KNOW HIM?

02:05.156 --> 02:06.397
I WAS A SECOND-YEAR RESIDENT.

02:06.397 --> 02:09.360
HE WAS MY FIRST
SOLO VALVE REPLACEMENT.
WOW.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.502
YEAH, AND SIX MONTHS BEFORE
HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE

02:11.502 --> 02:14.165
AND WON ALL THOSE GOLD MEDALS
ON THE HALF-PIPE.

02:14.165 --> 02:16.237
I BELIEVE MY VALVE IS
WHAT GIVES HIM HIS EDGE.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.238
MM-HMM.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.540
HIS HEART IS MY "MONA LISA."
(laughs)

02:19.540 --> 02:20.841
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.244
EXCUSE ME. WHERE'S
THE ONESIE DECORATING STATION?

02:23.244 --> 02:25.776
(bird cries in distance)
THERE ISN'T ONE.

02:25.776 --> 02:26.917
THERE'S A MARGARITA DECORATING
STATION, THOUGH.

02:26.917 --> 02:28.219
(clicks tongue) MM.
WHAT?

02:28.219 --> 02:29.420
LIMES.
MM-HMM.

02:29.420 --> 02:30.651
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT KIND OF BABY SHOWER...
SALT.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.882
DOESN'T HAVE
A ONESIE DECORATING STATION?

02:31.882 --> 02:33.824
I MEAN, I HAD ALREADY
FIGURED OUT MY DESIGN.

02:33.824 --> 02:34.855
IT WAS GONNA BE A STAR
AND A MOON,

02:34.855 --> 02:36.887
AND IT WAS GONNA SAY "McDREAMY."
(laughs)

02:36.887 --> 02:38.158
GET IT? THAT'S CUTE, RIGHT?
EXCUSE ME.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.491
IS IT TIME TO OPEN THE GIFTS
YET? I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

02:40.491 --> 02:43.434
MY FEET ARE LIKE SAUSAGES.
OH, COME ON, MER.

02:43.434 --> 02:44.695
OH, LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S ALL GLOWY AND PREGNANT.

02:44.695 --> 02:46.367
(Callie) WITH SAUSAGE FEET.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.369
LET'S HAVE A BABY.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.640
WHAT?

02:49.640 --> 02:51.171
WAIT. WAIT, WHAT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.943
WE'VE HAD SUCH A HARD YEAR
SINCE THE CRASH,

02:52.943 --> 02:54.745
AND... (inhales deeply)
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE

02:54.745 --> 02:56.547
TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW AND HAPPY
TO THINK ABOUT?

02:56.547 --> 02:58.449
YES. YES. BUT, UM, I--

02:58.449 --> 03:00.211
AND, YOU KNOW, I COULD CARRY--
I COULD CARRY THIS TIME.

03:00.211 --> 03:03.214
AND THEN THAT WAY, ONLY ONE OF
OUR FEET WOULD BE SAUSAGES.

03:03.214 --> 03:03.914
ARIZONA...
(giggles)

03:03.914 --> 03:05.216
SO... YOU WANT TO?

03:05.216 --> 03:07.187
YES! OH, MY GOD, YES!
(laughing)

03:07.187 --> 03:08.789
(Cristina) YOU SEEM HAPPY.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.622
OH, I AM HAPPY.
I AM REALLY, REALLY HAPPY.

03:11.622 --> 03:12.923
(Cristina and Callie giggle)

03:12.923 --> 03:14.365
HE IS SO MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
IN PERSON.

03:14.365 --> 03:16.227
I GOT HIM TO SIGN MY BOARD.
I GOT HIM TO SIGN MY BRA.

03:16.227 --> 03:18.429
(man) YEAH, SIGN MY CAST!
SO ARE THEY. (laughs)

03:18.429 --> 03:20.200
(all speaking at same time)

03:20.200 --> 03:23.374
CRISTINA YANG!

03:23.374 --> 03:25.806
OH!
OH! (laughing)

03:25.806 --> 03:28.839
OH, YOU LOOK BETTER AND BETTER
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU.

03:28.839 --> 03:30.441
DUMP YOUR HUSBAND.
RUN AWAY WITH ME.

03:30.441 --> 03:33.213
OH, COME ON. DON'T YOU
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
OH, WE'VE GOT A DEAL.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.485
I'M ALLOWED TO FLIRT
WITH HOT DOCTORS

03:34.485 --> 03:35.886
WHO'VE HAD THEIR HANDS
INSIDE MY CHEST.

03:35.886 --> 03:37.888
IT'S A VERY SHORT LIST.
(laughs)

03:37.888 --> 03:39.890
HEY, I'M TRAVIS.

03:39.890 --> 03:41.352
HI.
YOU'RE THE ORTHO GOD?

03:41.352 --> 03:43.954
CALLIE TORRES.
I PREFER GODDESS.
RIGHT ON.

03:43.954 --> 03:47.227
READY TO BUILD ME
A NEW HIP?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.859
(man) HE NEEDS TO BE ABLE
TO DO THIS.

03:48.859 --> 03:50.901
SEE? RIGHT... THERE.

03:50.901 --> 03:51.932
CAN A NEW HIP DO THAT?

03:51.932 --> 03:54.365
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WILL HE BE
DOING IT BY DECEMBER?

03:54.365 --> 03:55.706
HE'S GOT OLYMPIC QUALIFIERS
COMING UP.

03:55.706 --> 03:57.007
YOU MENTIONED A CRASH
LAST YEAR?

03:57.007 --> 03:58.509
THEY SAID IT GAVE ME
ARTHRITIS.

03:58.509 --> 04:00.311
(man) HE CAN'T WIN THE GOLD
WITH ARTHRITIS.

04:00.311 --> 04:01.672
I WANT THE PETERSON HIP.

04:01.672 --> 04:03.414
(paper rustles)
BUDDY OF MINE
GOT THIS ONE.

04:03.414 --> 04:04.915
HE WAS BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN
IN NO TIME.

04:04.915 --> 04:06.517
THIS IS WHAT I NEED.

04:06.517 --> 04:07.718
OKAY. (chuckles)

04:07.718 --> 04:09.520
EVEN IF I DID AGREE
THAT A HIP REPLACEMENT

04:09.520 --> 04:11.251
IS THE RIGHT COURSE
OF TREATMENT,

04:11.251 --> 04:12.823
I-I'VE NEVER EVEN USED,
THE, UH,

04:12.823 --> 04:14.024
PETERSON RESURFACING
HIP JOINT.

04:14.024 --> 04:17.588
I DOUBT YOU OR YOUR TEAM
WANT YOU TO BE MY FIRST.

04:17.588 --> 04:19.390
SHE MAKES A GOOD POINT.

04:19.390 --> 04:21.532
I WAS YANG'S FIRST VALVE
REPLACEMENT. THAT WORKED OUT.

04:21.532 --> 04:24.295
(chuckles)
I WAS THE FIRST GUY TO LAND
A TRIPLE CORK IN COMPETITION.

04:24.295 --> 04:25.666
NOW IT'S PRACTICALLY
STANDARD.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.868
YOU'RE THE FIRST ORTHOPEDIC
SURGEON TO GROW CARTILAGE

04:27.868 --> 04:28.869
OUT OF NOTHING.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.372
THE REASON
WE ARE WHO WE ARE,

04:31.372 --> 04:33.544
IS 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT
SCARED OF FIRSTS.

04:37.808 --> 04:39.980
(exhales deeply)

04:39.980 --> 04:41.352
(papers rustle)

04:41.352 --> 04:43.584
I'LL RESEARCH THE JOINT.
I'LL LEARN WHAT I CAN.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.055
I'M NOT MAKING ANY PROMISES.

04:45.055 --> 04:46.587
I'M NOT WORRIED.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.489
YOU'RE GONNA SAY "YES."

04:48.489 --> 04:50.921
(Callie) FOR
THE HUNDREDTH TIME, NO.

04:50.921 --> 04:52.523
I AM NOT ADMITTING
TO NEGLIGENCE

04:52.523 --> 04:54.024
WHEN THERE WAS
NO NEGLIGENCE. I--

04:54.024 --> 04:56.427
THEY'RE WILLING TO CALL YOU
A "NONPARTY AT FAULT."

04:56.427 --> 04:59.029
JURY PAYOUTS ARE ALWAYS BIGGER
THAN PRETRIAL SETTLEMENTS.

04:59.029 --> 05:00.701
IF THIS GOES SOUTH--

05:00.701 --> 05:02.032
DO YOU THINK IT'LL
GO SOUTH?

05:02.032 --> 05:04.004
(stammers) THERE WAS A MINOR
COMPLICATION DURING SURGERY

05:04.004 --> 05:05.376
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT
THE PATIENT HAD DEVELOPED

05:05.376 --> 05:06.807
A PULMONARY EMBOLUS.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.510
POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS ARE
A COMMON RECOGNIZED RISK.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.912
EVERYBODY--
AND THAT'S WHEN THE JURY'S EYES
WILL GLAZE OVER.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.014
ALL THEY'RE GONNA HEAR IS
A BUNCH OF BIG WORDS

05:14.014 --> 05:16.587
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
AND WHAT THEY WILL SEE

05:16.587 --> 05:19.620
IS THAT YOU MADE A MISTAKE,
AND YOUR PATIENT PAID THE PRICE.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.823
NO, IT WASN'T A MISTAKE, GREG.
I'M NOT SETTLING.

05:25.556 --> 05:26.597
OKAY.

05:26.597 --> 05:27.658
OKAY.

05:27.658 --> 05:29.329
OKAY.
OKAY.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.961
(man and woman
speak indistinctly)

05:30.961 --> 05:32.763
THEN THERE ARE THINGS
TO REMEMBER TOMORROW--

05:32.763 --> 05:35.005
LET THE JURY SEE YOUR FACE.
YOU WEAR A SUIT.

05:35.005 --> 05:36.937
DARK NOT BRIGHT.
SKIRT NOT PANTS.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.569
MINIMAL JEWELRY, HEELS,

05:38.569 --> 05:39.810
PANTY HOSE--
PANTY HOSE?

05:39.810 --> 05:41.812
PROFESSIONAL BUT FEMININE.

05:41.812 --> 05:43.574
YOU STILL HAVE
YOUR WEDDING RING?

05:43.574 --> 05:44.845
YES.
WEAR IT.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.018
JURIES RESPOND BETTER TO
MARRIED WOMEN WITH FAMILIES.

05:48.018 --> 05:49.950
NOW THERE'LL BE WATER
IN FRONT OF YOUR SEAT.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.051
YOU DRINK IT SPARINGLY.

05:51.051 --> 05:51.952
THERE ARE
NO BATHROOM BREAKS

05:51.952 --> 05:53.554
TILL THE JUDGE
CALLS FOR RECESS.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.426
I DON'T OWN
ANY PANTY HOSE.

05:55.426 --> 05:57.057
I-I-I HAVE TO GO SHOPPING.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.088
(loudly) DID YOU FLUSH?

05:58.088 --> 05:59.890
I DIDN'T-I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU FLUSH.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.962
OH, AND WASH YOUR HANDS!
IT'S ALMOST TIME TO GO!

06:01.962 --> 06:04.495
HEY, I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
THERE WAS TRAFFIC.

06:04.495 --> 06:05.796
NO, NO, IT'S FINE.
SHE'S READY.

06:05.796 --> 06:07.468
WELL, SHE WAS UNTIL
SHE DECIDED SHE HAD TO WEAR

06:07.468 --> 06:09.039
THE PURPLE DRESS INSTEAD
OF THE HEART DRESS.

06:09.039 --> 06:09.970
AND THEN
SHE HAD TO GO POTTY

06:09.970 --> 06:11.071
BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT HELP
GOING POTTY. SOFIA!

06:11.071 --> 06:12.403
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO CHECK

06:12.403 --> 06:14.044
AND MAKE SURE
SHE'S OKAY IN THERE.

06:14.044 --> 06:15.946
WHAT--ARE YOU OKAY?
UH, I HAVE NO IDEA.

06:15.946 --> 06:18.008
HEY, LISTEN, I KNOW YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOFIA TONIGHT,

06:18.008 --> 06:20.951
BUT IF IT'D BE EASIER FOR YOU
TO SPEND SOME TIME ALONE

06:20.951 --> 06:22.983
OR IF YOU'D RATHER NOT
BE ALONE THEN, YOU KNOW,

06:22.983 --> 06:25.085
YOU JUST TELL ME, AND WHATEVER
YOU NEED THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.458
OKAY, THANKS.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.922
WHAT?

06:31.922 --> 06:34.064
NOTHING.

06:36.627 --> 06:38.028
YOU PUT YOUR RING BACK ON.

06:38.028 --> 06:39.930
THEY TOLD ME TO.

06:39.930 --> 06:42.773
ANYWAY, GOOD LUCK TODAY.

06:42.773 --> 06:45.536
THANKS.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.685
YOU READY?

06:54.685 --> 06:55.846
(bell dings)
SURE.

06:55.846 --> 06:57.588
(reporters shouting
at same time)

06:57.588 --> 06:58.919
EXCUSE ME. NO COMMENT.

07:00.491 --> 07:02.923
(screams) UH...

07:02.923 --> 07:04.194
DOCTOR, WHAT HAPPENED?
GREG? GREG?!

07:04.194 --> 07:05.996
STEP ASIDE. GOOD MORNING.
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

07:05.996 --> 07:07.998
UH, A BUNCH OF US
ARE TAKING SHIFTS.

07:07.998 --> 07:10.461
WE WANTED YOU TO HAVE
AT LEAST ONE PERSON

07:10.461 --> 07:12.432
IN COURT WITH YOU
THE ENTIRE TIME.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.004
I HAD TO FIGHT BAILEY
FOR THIS FIRST SHIFT.

07:14.004 --> 07:16.807
TURNS OUT SHE PUNCHES PRETTY
HARD FOR SUCH A LITTLE PERSON.

07:16.807 --> 07:18.939
EXCUSE US! THANK YOU.
DR. TORRES!

07:18.939 --> 07:22.473
(sighs) I CAN'T EVEN SWALLOW.
MY MOUTH IS SO DRY.

07:22.473 --> 07:25.175
YOU CAN DO THIS. I WILL BE
SITTING RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

07:25.175 --> 07:26.917
OKAY?
(Greg) WE'RE UP HERE.

07:28.979 --> 07:31.051
(gallery murmuring)

07:34.885 --> 07:36.957
(sighs)

07:36.957 --> 07:38.188
CALLIE?

07:38.188 --> 07:39.560
(muffled) HMM?

07:44.935 --> 07:46.897
(whispers) OH, DAMN IT!

07:48.969 --> 07:50.501
(door opens)

07:53.744 --> 07:56.476
(murmuring)

08:07.057 --> 08:08.218
(door opens)

08:08.218 --> 08:11.061
ALL RISE!

08:17.497 --> 08:18.569
WOULD IF I COULD.

08:18.569 --> 08:19.770
(laughter)

08:21.201 --> 08:32.082
(under breath) CRAP.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.287
THIS CASE IS ABOUT A MAN
THAT YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW--

08:37.287 --> 08:39.089
AT LEAST BY REPUTATION,
MR. TRAVIS REED.

08:39.089 --> 08:40.751
(Alex) I GOT HERE AS SOON
AS I COULD.

08:40.751 --> 08:43.293
MY NEPHRECTOMY WENT LONG.
WHAT'D I MISS?

08:43.293 --> 08:45.195
THEY'RE STILL ON
OPENING STATEMENTS.

08:45.195 --> 08:46.557
THIS GUY'S BEEN GOING
FOR A WHILE.

08:46.557 --> 08:49.199
HE'S DOING THAT
FOLKSY CHARM THING,

08:49.199 --> 08:50.931
AND THE JURY
IS EATING IT UP.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.202
NOW SERVING AS A JUROR

08:52.202 --> 08:54.705
IN A MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASE
ISN'T EASY.

08:54.705 --> 08:57.007
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT Y'ALL,
BUT I'M NO DOCTOR.

08:57.007 --> 08:59.670
HELL, I BARELY MADE IT THROUGH
HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY, SO...

08:59.670 --> 09:00.841
(jury laughs)

09:00.841 --> 09:04.745
BUT YOU ARE GOING TO GET
A CRASH COURSE EDUCATION

09:04.745 --> 09:08.649
IN ORTHOPEDIC MEDICINE
AND POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS.

09:08.649 --> 09:12.853
AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR WORDS
LIKE "PSEUDOMONAS" AND "EMBOLI."

09:12.853 --> 09:15.686
DON'T LET THAT INTIMIDATE YOU.

09:15.686 --> 09:19.660
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IS THE EVIDENCE.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.861
(lowered voice) THOSE THINGS
ARE PART OF THE EVIDENCE.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.262
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
SHH.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.234
AND THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE
WILL FOCUS ON

09:24.234 --> 09:26.236
A 16-DAY PERIOD LAST SPRING.

09:26.236 --> 09:30.200
AND DURING THIS TIME WE WILL
ESTABLISH THAT DR. TORRES

09:30.200 --> 09:34.574
AGREED TO PERFORM A SURGERY
SHE DID NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.577
WE WILL ESTABLISH THAT
DR. TORRES MADE A SERIES

09:37.577 --> 09:41.251
OF FAULTY DECISIONS, EVENTUALLY
COSTING MR. TRAVIS REED--

09:41.251 --> 09:45.585
A THRIVING, HEALTHY
OLYMPIC ATHLETE--

09:45.585 --> 09:47.688
HIS LEGS.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.691
AND WE WILL ESTABLISH THAT
ALL OF THIS STARTED

09:50.691 --> 09:54.224
BECAUSE OF ONE CARELESS MISTAKE
MADE IN SURGERY.

09:54.224 --> 09:55.726
(monitor beeping steadily)

09:55.726 --> 09:58.228
IMPLANT'S IN PLACE.
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

09:58.228 --> 10:00.070
NOW I JUST
NEED TO IRRIGATE--
(monitor beeping erratically)

10:00.070 --> 10:01.772
HIS HEART RATE JUST JUMPED
TO THE 150s.

10:01.772 --> 10:03.333
HAVING TROUBLE VENTILATING.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.805
INCREASING HIS OXYGEN
TO 100%.

10:04.805 --> 10:05.736
DAMN IT. ALL RIGHT,
COULD BE A P.E.

10:05.736 --> 10:07.037
WE'VE GOTTA GET HIM
OFF THIS TABLE.

10:07.037 --> 10:08.178
ALL RIGHT, LET'S START CLOSING.
IRRIGATION, PLEASE.

10:08.178 --> 10:09.609
WAIT, THE SPONGE COUNT
IS OFF.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.881
WE'RE MISSING ONE SPONGE.

10:10.881 --> 10:13.143
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WE CAN'T CLOSE UNTIL
WE FIND IT.

10:13.143 --> 10:15.986
SATS ARE CONTINUING TO DROP.
SWITCHING TO MANUAL VENTILATION.

10:15.986 --> 10:17.117
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOTTA
BE ON SOMEONE'S SHOE

10:17.117 --> 10:18.288
OR SOMETHING.
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.

10:18.288 --> 10:19.690
YOU WANT ME TO CALL
FOR A PORTABLE X-RAY?

10:19.690 --> 10:20.951
NO, THAT'LL TAKE TOO LONG.
HE COULD GO INTO SHOCK.

10:20.951 --> 10:22.152
(man) B.P.'S DROPPED
TO 70 OVER 40.

10:22.152 --> 10:23.754
(Callie) OH, CRAP, CRAP,
CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP.

10:23.754 --> 10:25.796
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO CALL FOR--
NO, THERE'S NO TIME.

10:25.796 --> 10:26.927
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE CLOSING HIM UP.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.098
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

10:28.098 --> 10:29.660
WELL, YOU KNOW, UH, WE HAVE TO.
LAP PADS.

10:29.660 --> 10:31.401
WE STILL HAVEN'T--
I DON'T CARE.
WE'RE CLOSING HIM UP.

10:31.401 --> 10:33.103
ZERO VICRYL.

10:33.103 --> 10:34.765
ZERO VICRYL NOW!

10:34.765 --> 10:37.037
NOW!

10:37.037 --> 10:40.270
(man chuckles) HANG ON,
HANG ON, HANG ON.

10:40.270 --> 10:43.814
ARE YOU SAYING THAT DR. TORRES
KNEW SHE LEFT A SPONGE

10:43.814 --> 10:45.846
IN MR. REED'S BODY,
AND SHE DIDN'T CARE?

10:45.846 --> 10:48.779
NO, OF COURSE
SHE CARED BUT--
NO, BUT STILL,

10:48.779 --> 10:50.981
SHE KNOWINGLY
LEFT BEHIND A SPONGE.

10:50.981 --> 10:54.184
THE PATIENT WAS RUNNING
OUT OF TIME. HE WOULD HAVE--

10:54.184 --> 10:57.257
HON, HON, IT'S A YES OR NO
QUESTION. THANK YOU.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.730
DID SHE KNOWINGLY
LEAVE A SPONGE?

11:02.362 --> 11:04.995
YES.

11:04.995 --> 11:08.038
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT A--
I'VE GOT A BOY IN COLLEGE.

11:08.038 --> 11:09.169
GOOD KID.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.941
AND I WENT TO VISIT HIM
LAST MONTH,

11:10.941 --> 11:13.774
AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
THE SPONGE I FOUND IN HIS SINK.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.675
I MEAN, THERE'S NO TELLIN'
WHAT WAS GOING ON--

11:15.675 --> 11:16.747
OBJECTION. IRRELEVANT.

11:16.747 --> 11:18.178
SUSTAINED.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.710
(man) ALL RIGHT, LET'S
FAST-FORWARD TO THE NEXT TIME

11:19.710 --> 11:20.881
YOU SAW MR. REED.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.412
ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER.

11:22.412 --> 11:23.784
AND HOW WAS HE THEN?

11:23.784 --> 11:27.287
WAS HE... GOOD? HAPPY?
RECOVERING WELL?

11:27.287 --> 11:30.761
HE HAD AN INFECTION.

11:30.761 --> 11:32.462
(Callie) HI, THERE.

11:32.462 --> 11:34.694
TRAVIS, I HEAR YOU GOT
QUITE THE FEVER.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.466
TEMP'S 103. I'M JUST
STARTING HIS WORKUP.

11:36.466 --> 11:37.928
HE'S BURNING UP.
HE WON'T EAT.

11:37.928 --> 11:39.429
I HAD TO FORCE HIM
TO COME IN.

11:39.429 --> 11:40.731
(Callie) HOW ARE YOU
FEELING, TRAVIS?

11:40.731 --> 11:41.772
I'VE SEEN WORSE.

11:41.772 --> 11:44.775
DR. TORRES, YOU WANNA
TAKE A LISTEN TO THIS?

11:44.775 --> 11:45.776
YEAH.

11:45.776 --> 11:48.038
(whispers) OKAY.

11:48.038 --> 11:49.840
(exhales)

11:51.912 --> 11:52.943
IS THAT A MURMUR?

11:52.943 --> 11:55.015
A SMALL ONE.
TRAVIS, I'M JUST GONNA

11:55.015 --> 11:57.717
TAKE A LOOK AT
YOUR INCISION SITE, OKAY?

11:57.717 --> 12:00.821
(monitor beeping steadily)

12:02.452 --> 12:03.754
OH, WOW.

12:03.754 --> 12:04.995
OH, WOW?
WHAT DOES "OH, WOW" MEAN?

12:04.995 --> 12:06.997
WHITNEY, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY.

12:06.997 --> 12:08.859
THE WOUND LOOKS
A LITTLE INFECTED.

12:08.859 --> 12:10.901
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA GO IN
AND CLEAN IT ALL OUT, OKAY?

12:10.901 --> 12:12.202
YEAH.
OKAY.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.037
OKAY, GET HIM ON VANC
AND CLINDA, STAT.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.438
CALL UPSTAIRS. I NEED
AN O.R. RIGHT NOW.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.739
WHAT ABOUT THE MURMUR?

12:19.739 --> 12:20.941
COULD THE INFECTION HAVE
TRAVELED TO HIS HEART?

12:20.941 --> 12:22.072
HIS VITALS ARE STABLE.
SO FIRST,

12:22.072 --> 12:23.343
WE'VE GOT TO CLEAN OUT
THAT JOINT, OKAY?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.474
WE CAN'T AFFORD ANY DELAYS.

12:24.474 --> 12:25.776
OKAY. SHOULD I CALL YANG?

12:25.776 --> 12:27.377
(sighs) ALL RIGHT,
IF SHE'S NOT AVAILABLE

12:27.377 --> 12:29.449
IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES,
SHE WAITS UNTIL POST-OP.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.521
WE'VE GOT TO GET IN THERE
AND KILL THIS INFECTION

12:31.521 --> 12:33.123
BEFORE IT SPREADS
ANY FURTHER.

12:33.123 --> 12:35.826
I AM NOT TURNING AN OLYMPIC
ATHLETE INTO A DOORSTOP.

12:37.487 --> 12:40.430
YEAH, THE INFECTION'S GOING
THROUGH THE FASCIA

12:40.430 --> 12:41.531
DOWN TO THE PROSTHESIS.

12:41.531 --> 12:42.933
GET IN HERE AND IRRIGATE
BEFORE WE MOVE ON.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.364
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S PUS
IN THE ACETABULUM.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.837
OH, DAMN IT!
(suction gurgling)

12:46.837 --> 12:48.068
NO, THERE'S NO WAY
TO SALVAGE THE JOINT.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.539
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
REMOVE THE WHOLE THING.

12:49.539 --> 12:50.871
AND JUST... LEAVE HIM
WITH NO HIP?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.102
WELL, FOR NOW.

12:52.102 --> 12:53.874
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET
THIS COMPLETELY CLEANED OUT.

12:53.874 --> 12:54.975
OSTEOTOME AND MALLET?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.176
(man) THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY NASTY.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.547
POST-OP INFECTIONS ARE
VERY COMMON.

12:57.547 --> 12:58.809
THEY HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

12:58.809 --> 13:00.010
IS THAT YOUR
PROFESSIONAL OPINION?

13:00.010 --> 13:01.351
IT IS.
I SEE.

13:01.351 --> 13:04.154
AND IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL
OPINION, IS IT ALSO COMMON

13:04.154 --> 13:06.857
FOR A POST-OP INFECTION TO
RESULT IN A DOUBLE AMPUTATION?

13:06.857 --> 13:08.318
DOES THAT HAPPEN
ALL THE TIME, TOO?

13:08.318 --> 13:09.489
NO, BUT, UH--

13:09.489 --> 13:11.421
NO, UH, NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

13:11.421 --> 13:13.023
THAT'S NOT FAIR! YOU'RE NOT
LETTING ME FINISH.

13:13.023 --> 13:14.064
(judge) THAT'S ENOUGH,
DR. WILSON.

13:14.064 --> 13:15.425
BUT I NEED TO EXPLAIN--

13:15.425 --> 13:18.829
ANOTHER WORD OUT OF TURN,
AND I'LL HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT.

13:18.829 --> 13:20.300
(gavel bangs)
(murmuring)

13:21.801 --> 13:23.173
(shoes clatter)

13:23.173 --> 13:24.875
(exhales deeply)

13:24.875 --> 13:26.506
(grunts)

13:26.506 --> 13:29.379
OH, TELL ME
I PACKED A SPARE PAIR.

13:29.379 --> 13:32.012
OH, THANK GOD. (crying)

13:32.012 --> 13:34.014
OH, HI. I'M SORRY.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.316
I-I'LL COME BACK.
(voice breaking) NO, NO, NO,
IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.548
I'M JUST, UM, I HAVE TO SIT
IN THERE AND LISTEN TO THAT GUY.

13:38.548 --> 13:42.222
AND I CAN'T REACT OR THAT'LL
MAKE ME LOOK UNLIKABLE OR PETTY.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.454
BUT HOW THE HELL
AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO REACT?

13:44.454 --> 13:45.595
HE'S AWFUL.

13:45.595 --> 13:47.157
AND HE'S MAKING ME SOUND AWFUL.

13:47.157 --> 13:48.899
(exhales and grunts)

13:48.899 --> 13:52.332
UM, I-I THINK
I HAVE SOMETHING

13:52.332 --> 13:54.264
THAT WILL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.
(unzips bag)

13:54.264 --> 13:58.909
SO SOFIA DREW THIS
IN THE CAR THIS MORNING.
(exhales and sniffles)

13:58.909 --> 14:01.841
AND SHE SAID THAT
IT'S OF A JELLYFISH

14:01.841 --> 14:04.344
AND A RAINBOW MERMAID.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.515
I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE
IS WHICH. (chuckles)

14:05.515 --> 14:08.448
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE IT.
AND THEN WHEN YOU

14:08.448 --> 14:10.550
FEEL LIKE SCREAMING,
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE JELLYFISH

14:10.550 --> 14:11.952
AND THEN IT WILL
CALM YOU DOWN.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.324
OH. (chuckles)

14:16.586 --> 14:20.260
(sniffles) I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE HERE.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.062
THANKS.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.563
THANK YOU.

14:23.563 --> 14:29.639
UGH. I SHOULD GET BACK.
OH, GOD.

14:29.639 --> 14:32.472
UM, CALLIE?

14:32.472 --> 14:34.504
YES?
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU
WANNA WEAR, UM,

14:34.504 --> 14:36.006
RHINESTONE BUTTERFLIES
IN COURT?

14:36.006 --> 14:38.578
I MEAN, IT'S--IT'S
YOUR CHOICE.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.010
IT'S A STRANGE ONE.

14:40.010 --> 14:43.213
BUT I SUPPOSE THAT LOTS OF
PEOPLE LIKE BUTTERFLIES SO...

14:43.213 --> 14:44.314
YEAH. (chuckles)

14:44.314 --> 14:47.117
THEY'RE CUTE.
(laughing)

14:47.117 --> 14:48.618
WHAT?
WHAT?

14:48.618 --> 14:51.521
(both laughing)

14:51.521 --> 14:53.893
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:53.893 --> 14:57.998
NO MORE RIDICULOUS THAN
VETOING EVERY GUY UNDER 6'3".

14:57.998 --> 15:00.300
WE ARE NOT CHOOSING
OUR SPERM DONOR

15:00.300 --> 15:02.572
BASED ON HIS TASTE IN MUSIC.

15:02.572 --> 15:06.276
WELL... OH, LOOK.
OH, THIS ONE'S CUTE.

15:06.276 --> 15:08.608
OH, THAT'S
A SUPER CUTE BABY.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.509
HE WOULD MAKE
SUPER CUTE BABIES.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.041
YEAH!
MM-HMM.

15:11.041 --> 15:12.682
OKAY, SO. HERE... OH.
HMM?

15:12.682 --> 15:14.484
HMM.
HE'S A COLLEGE DROPOUT.

15:14.484 --> 15:15.986
PASS.
PASS.

15:15.986 --> 15:17.487
OKAY, UH--OOH, I'M EMPTY.

15:17.487 --> 15:20.690
NOW THIS ONE SAYS
HE'S A MATHEMATICIAN

15:20.690 --> 15:22.552
WITH A GRADUATE DEGREE.
OH, WOW.

15:22.552 --> 15:23.653
AND...

15:23.653 --> 15:25.555
(singsongy)
HE RUNS MARATHONS.

15:25.555 --> 15:26.626
OH, PICTURE?

15:26.626 --> 15:27.697
(clears throat)

15:27.697 --> 15:29.659
OH.
(inhales sharply)

15:31.231 --> 15:32.562
OKAY, UM...

15:32.562 --> 15:35.065
WELL, I STILL LIKE
THE IVY LEAGUE POET.

15:35.065 --> 15:36.436
OKAY, LET'S--
SMART AND CREATIVE.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.607
OKAY.

15:39.569 --> 15:41.341
YOU THINK I'LL LIKE
BEING PREGNANT?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.473
OH, YEAH. IT'S THE BEST.

15:43.473 --> 15:46.646
OH, EXCEPT FOR THE NAUSEA.
OH, AND THE STRETCH MARKS.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.547
AND THE PEEING.
MM.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.549
AND THE LACK OF SLEEP,
THE EXHAUSTION.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.621
OH, AND THEN THE--
THE NO BOOZE.

15:51.621 --> 15:53.383
(car horn honks in distance)

15:53.383 --> 15:55.425
NO BOOZE.
MNH-MNH.

15:55.425 --> 15:57.627
OHH.
MM-HMM.

15:57.627 --> 16:01.591
OH, I WILL MISS YOU
MOST OF ALL.

16:01.591 --> 16:04.594
(siren wailing in distance)

16:09.669 --> 16:11.201
(sets down bottle)

16:16.546 --> 16:18.748
(ring clatters)

16:18.748 --> 16:21.311
(knock on door)

16:21.311 --> 16:23.613
ARIZONA?

16:23.613 --> 16:26.016
YOU'RE, UH, YOU'RE EARLY.
I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT

16:26.016 --> 16:29.259
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T BRINGING
HER BY TILL AFTER DINNER.

16:29.259 --> 16:31.661
(gasps) DADDY.

16:31.661 --> 16:32.662
MIJA.

16:34.524 --> 16:36.996
(sighs deeply)

16:36.996 --> 16:39.199
MMM.
(kisses)

16:44.174 --> 16:45.235
YOU MENTIONED THE TRIAL
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

16:45.235 --> 16:46.206
IT'S NEVER NOTHING.
(chuckles)

16:46.206 --> 16:48.178
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE BEEN SUED?

16:48.178 --> 16:50.180
MY LAWYER'S ON SPEED DIAL,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

16:50.180 --> 16:53.083
HE'S VERY GOOD. TECHNICALLY,
HIS TACTICS ARE LEGAL.

16:53.083 --> 16:56.146
(laughs)
YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO
COME ALL THIS WAY.

16:56.146 --> 16:58.248
OF COURSE I DID.
OF COURSE I DID.

16:58.248 --> 16:59.389
MY BABY'S IN TROUBLE. MM.
(siren wailing in distance)

16:59.389 --> 17:03.223
BUT FIRST, WHERE'S MY GRANDBABY?
MM-HMM. COME ON, NOW.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.654
ABUELO NEEDS A HUG.

17:06.256 --> 17:08.198
DON'T TELL ME
SHE'S ALREADY ASLEEP.

17:08.198 --> 17:09.659
NO. N-NO.

17:09.659 --> 17:11.161
SHE'S, UM...

17:11.161 --> 17:12.402
(clicks tongue)
SHE'S--WELL, SHE'S NOT HERE.

17:12.402 --> 17:14.304
(chuckles)

17:14.304 --> 17:16.236
ARIZONA'S GONNA BRING HER
BY IN AN HOUR.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.768
OH, ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:18.768 --> 17:20.140
WH-WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:22.672 --> 17:25.415
WE SPLIT UP. SHE CHEATED ON ME.
IT'S BEEN BAD.

17:25.415 --> 17:27.417
I REALLY DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT. (clears throat)

17:27.417 --> 17:29.249
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.181
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
I JUST, I DIDN'T WANNA
GET INTO IT, DAD.

17:31.181 --> 17:34.184
I-I FOUGHT SO HARD JUST TO
GET YOU TO ACCEPT US.

17:34.184 --> 17:36.186
MOM HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME
SINCE THE WEDDING.

17:36.186 --> 17:39.229
AND I JUST... APPARENTLY,
I MARRY PEOPLE WHO CHEAT ON ME.

17:39.229 --> 17:41.691
IT'S PATHETIC.

17:41.691 --> 17:43.193
I AM PATHETIC.

17:43.193 --> 17:45.495
NO.

17:45.495 --> 17:47.467
WHEN THAT O'MALLEY KID
CHEATED ON YOU,

17:47.467 --> 17:49.539
I WAS READY
TO KNOCK HIS TEETH OUT.
MM.

17:49.539 --> 17:51.541
MM? NOW--NOW
I WON'T HIT A LADY

17:51.541 --> 17:53.473
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.445
I KNOW PEOPLE. JUST SAY
THE WORD, ALL RIGHT?

17:55.445 --> 17:59.209
NO, DAD. (scoffs) GOD, NO.

17:59.209 --> 18:00.280
ALL RIGHT.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.481
(exhales deeply)

18:01.481 --> 18:03.313
LOOK AT ME.

18:03.313 --> 18:05.255
MIJA, LOOK AT ME.

18:05.255 --> 18:08.288
(sighs)

18:11.391 --> 18:14.264
NOTHING ABOUT YOU
IS PATHETIC.

18:22.232 --> 18:23.473
DON'T HATE ME!

18:23.473 --> 18:24.804
I KNOW I SAID I WAS GONNA
COOK DINNER TONIGHT,

18:24.804 --> 18:26.206
BUT I'VE STILL GOT A LOT
OF WORK TO CATCH UP ON.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.107
SO...
(singsongy) WHO WANTS PIZZA?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.540
(gasps) HEY, SWEETIE.
WHERE'S MOMMY?

18:30.540 --> 18:31.641
(Arizona) CALLIE?

18:31.641 --> 18:32.782
(keys clatter)
YEAH. HI, I'M HOME!

18:32.782 --> 18:35.114
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.286
CALLIE!

18:36.286 --> 18:40.290
(siren wailing in distance)

18:40.290 --> 18:42.252
ARE YOU OKAY?
IS EV-EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

18:47.797 --> 18:49.699
WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

18:49.699 --> 18:51.301
(laughs)
(screams)

18:51.301 --> 18:54.304
MY BOOBS WERE HURTING, AND--
AND THEN I THOUGHT... MAYBE?

18:54.304 --> 18:56.406
BUT I'M ONLY A DAY LATE
AND I-I DIDN'T EVEN THINK

18:56.406 --> 18:58.638
THAT IT WOULD SHOW UP ON A TEST
SO SOON.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.610
WE'RE HAVING A BABY!
WE'RE HAVING A BABY!

19:00.610 --> 19:02.272
(Callie laughs)

19:02.272 --> 19:05.215
OH!

19:05.215 --> 19:06.346
(whispers) HI.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.318
HI, SWEET BABY.

19:08.318 --> 19:11.181
MMM. MMM. MMM.

19:11.181 --> 19:12.752
(door opens)

19:12.752 --> 19:14.784
(sighs)

19:20.690 --> 19:23.263
(woman over P.A.)
DR. HERNANDEZ TO ONCOLOGY.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.664
DR. HERNANDEZ TO ONCOLOGY.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.236
ALL RIGHT,
GONNA MAKE THIS QUICK.

19:26.236 --> 19:27.697
I KNOW WE ARE ALL BUSY.

19:27.697 --> 19:29.199
CALLIE, I THOUGHT YOU UNDERSTOOD
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

19:29.199 --> 19:30.340
I KNOW. (clears throat)

19:30.340 --> 19:31.241
I KNOW IT'S A CONFLICT
OF INTEREST.

19:31.241 --> 19:32.572
I JUST--I WANTED
TO SAY SOMETHING

19:32.572 --> 19:34.244
BEFORE YOU GET STARTED.

19:34.244 --> 19:36.276
TRAVIS REED IS SUING BOTH
ME AND THE HOSPITAL.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.308
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF SETTLING WITH HIM,

19:38.308 --> 19:39.279
BUT THE HOSPITAL SHOULD.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.281
AS AN OWNER AND A MEMBER
OF THE BOARD,

19:41.281 --> 19:42.312
I KNOW HOW HARD IT'S BEEN

19:42.312 --> 19:43.783
TO GET THIS PLACE
BACK ON ITS FEET.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.216
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO
JEOPARDIZE THAT BECAUSE OF ME.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.322
(door opens)

19:52.322 --> 19:53.493
(door closes)

19:53.493 --> 19:54.664
(Derek) WHAT DID
OUR LEGAL TEAM SAY?

19:54.664 --> 19:56.926
UM, YEAH, THEY SAID THAT
WE SHOULD SETTLE

19:56.926 --> 19:58.298
NOW, QUICKLY AND QUIETLY.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.799
WHAT IF WE DON'T?
WELL, THIS THING
GOES TO TRIAL

19:59.799 --> 20:00.970
AND THERE'S A JUDGMENT
AGAINST US,

20:00.970 --> 20:02.302
WE COULD OWE MILLIONS

20:02.302 --> 20:03.433
OR WE COULD SETTLE THIS
FOR MUCH LESS.

20:03.433 --> 20:04.774
IF WE GO TO TRIAL,

20:04.774 --> 20:06.436
WE RISK BANKRUPTCY
ALL OVER AGAIN.

20:06.436 --> 20:07.977
ONLY IF WE LOSE.
THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO THIS.

20:07.977 --> 20:10.480
IF CALLIE ISN'T SETTLING,
MAYBE NEITHER SHOULD WE.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.911
UH, NO. I WAS THERE.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.943
I SAW FIRSTHAND WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THIS PATIENT.

20:13.943 --> 20:15.915
AND HE HAS A CASE.
A GOOD CASE.

20:15.915 --> 20:16.986
WE SHOULD SETTLE.

20:16.986 --> 20:19.549
AND, FRANKLY,
CALLIE SHOULD, TOO.

20:19.549 --> 20:21.591
DR. YANG, WHAT IS YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH TRAVIS REED?

20:21.591 --> 20:23.453
UH, TRAVIS FIRST
CAME TO ME SIX YEARS AGO

20:23.453 --> 20:26.526
WITH A BICUSPID AORTIC VALVE.
I REPLACED THE VALVE,

20:26.526 --> 20:28.458
AND HAVE OVERSEEN
HIS CARDIAC CARE EVER SINCE.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.660
AND IT WAS YOU, I BELIEVE, WHO
RECOMMENDED HIM TO DR. TORRES.

20:30.660 --> 20:31.831
IS THAT RIGHT?

20:31.831 --> 20:34.264
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY WAS THAT?

20:34.264 --> 20:36.306
BECAUSE WAS THE BEST
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON I KNEW.

20:36.306 --> 20:39.269
WAS?
(gallery chuckles)

20:39.269 --> 20:40.540
AS IN PAST TENSE?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.942
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
SHE'S THE BEST ANYMORE?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.316
(monitor beeping rapidly)
THERE ARE VEGETATIONS
ALL OVER HIS AORTIC VALVE.

20:46.316 --> 20:47.477
WHY DIDN'T YOU PAGE ME
SOONER?

20:47.477 --> 20:48.978
WE JUST HEARD THE MURMUR
THIS MORNING.

20:48.978 --> 20:50.520
THIS MORNING?
YEAH.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.682
LOOK AT THIS GROWTH.
YOU KNEW HE WAS A HEART PATIENT.

20:52.682 --> 20:53.923
THIS DIDN'T CONCERN YOU?

20:53.923 --> 20:56.255
OF COURSE IT DID.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.558
SO WHAT DO WE DO?
THE INFECTION IS EATING AWAY
AT HIS GRAFT.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.790
BEST CASE--I GO IN,
CLEAN IT OUT, AND REPAIR IT.

21:00.790 --> 21:03.032
WORST CASE--HE NEEDS
A WHOLE NEW VALVE.

21:03.032 --> 21:04.994
DR. TORRES,
YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.

21:04.994 --> 21:08.638
I WAS CHANGING HIS COMPRESSION
SOCKS AND I SAW THIS.

21:08.638 --> 21:10.840
HIS LEG'S GRAY, COLD.
I CAN'T FIND A PULSE.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.001
OKAY, WHERE'S WHITNEY?

21:12.001 --> 21:13.473
I TOLD HER SHE HAD TIME
TO GRAB LUNCH

21:13.473 --> 21:14.504
BEFORE TRAVIS WOKE UP.

21:14.504 --> 21:16.346
ALL RIGHT, YOU NEED TO
GO FIND HER

21:16.346 --> 21:18.678
AND TELL HER THAT TRAVIS
NEEDS ANOTHER SURGERY.
OKAY.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.510
(instrument beating
rhythmically)

21:20.510 --> 21:21.981
OKAY, I'VE GOTTA GO IN AND DO
AN EMBOLECTOMY ON THIS LEG--

21:21.981 --> 21:23.553
UNH-UNH, NO. I GOTTA GO IN
AND FIX HIS HEART.

21:23.553 --> 21:24.984
YOU CAN DO THAT LATER.
I NEED TO DO THIS NOW.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.357
LATER? IT'S ALREADY LATER.
HE HAS LOST BLOOD FLOW!

21:27.357 --> 21:29.519
HE'S CLEARLY THROWING EMBOLI
INTO HIS EXTREMITIES.

21:29.519 --> 21:30.690
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
THE EMBOLI IS COMING FROM?

21:30.690 --> 21:31.721
HIS INFECTED HEART.

21:31.721 --> 21:33.363
CRISTINA--
HEY, HEY, HEY!

21:33.363 --> 21:34.824
I CAN HEAR YOU TWO FROM
ALL THE WAY THE DAMN HALLWAY.

21:34.824 --> 21:36.966
WILL YOU TELL CALLIE TO BACK OFF
AND LET ME DO MY JOB?

21:36.966 --> 21:38.067
YEAH, TELL CRISTINA TO BACK OFF
AND LET ME DO MINE.

21:38.067 --> 21:39.699
IF I DON'T TRY
THIS EMBOLECTOMY,

21:39.699 --> 21:41.531
HE COULD LOSE HIS LEG.
WELL, HE CAN LIVE
WITHOUT A LEG.

21:41.531 --> 21:42.802
HE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT
A FUNCTIONING HEART.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.734
LOOK, IF YOU DO
THE HEART TOMORROW,

21:44.734 --> 21:46.305
IT GIVES HIM AN EXTRA DAY
ON ANTIBIOTICS, ALL RIGHT?

21:46.305 --> 21:47.337
HE'LL BE MORE STABLE,

21:47.337 --> 21:48.978
AND THE HEART SURGERY
WILL BE LESS RISKY.

21:48.978 --> 21:50.880
CRISTINA, THIS IS TRAVIS REED
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.682
LET ME TRY TO SAVE HIS LEG.

21:52.682 --> 21:55.345
(Cristina) DR. TORRES PERFORMED
THE EMBOLECTOMY THAT AFTERNOON.

21:55.345 --> 21:56.816
AGAINST YOUR WISHES?

21:56.816 --> 21:59.318
WE HAD A PROFESSIONAL
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.791
YOU KNOW, IN MY OFFICE,
IF ONE OF MY CO-WORKERS

22:01.791 --> 22:04.654
WAS SHOUTING AT ME SO LOUDLY
THAT YOU COULD HEAR HIM

22:04.654 --> 22:05.995
ALL THE WAY DOWN THE HALL,

22:05.995 --> 22:07.026
IT WOULD MORE THAN JUST
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.558
IT WOULD BE GROUNDS
FOR A DISMISSAL.

22:08.558 --> 22:11.330
WE ARE PASSIONATE
ABOUT OUR WORK.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.434
AND IN THE END, I AGREED
WITH DR. TORRES,

22:14.434 --> 22:15.865
THAT THE HEART SURGERY
COULD WAIT.

22:15.865 --> 22:17.407
YOU AGREED?
YES.

22:17.407 --> 22:18.768
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WEREN'T BULLIED?

22:18.768 --> 22:19.939
OBJECTION.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.110
(Callie) YEAH, I KNOW.

22:21.110 --> 22:22.642
THE EMBOLECTOMY COULD NOT
HAVE GONE BETTER.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.843
I MEAN, HIS LEG WAS ALREADY
PINKING UP BY THE TIME

22:23.843 --> 22:25.014
I SAW HIM IN RECOVERY
LAST NIGHT.

22:25.014 --> 22:26.345
WHAT'S HIS TEMP?

22:26.345 --> 22:28.548
OH, HE WAS FEBRILE OVERNIGHT
BUT HIS WHITE COUNT'S STABLE.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.481
(Travis breathing heavily)

22:31.481 --> 22:33.352
WHAT'S GOING ON?
TRAVIS?

22:33.352 --> 22:34.984
WHAT AREN'T YOU TELLING ME?
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:38.758 --> 22:40.059
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH MY LEGS?!

22:49.669 --> 22:50.740
(beep)
ARE WE LOSING THIS CASE?

22:50.740 --> 22:52.141
IT'S... TOO EARLY
TO PANIC.

22:52.141 --> 22:53.843
(sighs deeply)
WE HAVEN'T PRESENTED
OUR SIDE.

22:53.843 --> 22:56.646
THERE SHE IS.

22:56.646 --> 22:58.848
RICHARD! WELL,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

22:58.848 --> 23:01.380
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM,
BUT HE INSISTED ON COMING.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.812
IT'S A MIRACLE
I MADE IT HERE AT ALL.

23:02.812 --> 23:05.715
KEPNER'S A TERRIBLE DRIVER.

23:05.715 --> 23:06.786
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

23:06.786 --> 23:10.089
(man) YOU KNEW IT WAS BAD.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.663
(Whitney) HIS LEGS WERE BLACK.
I KNEW IT WASN'T GOOD.

23:13.663 --> 23:15.825
THEY CUT THEM OFF THAT NIGHT.

23:15.825 --> 23:17.567
NOW DID YOU HAVE
ANY INDICATION

23:17.567 --> 23:18.828
THAT DR. TORRES
WAS EVEN WORRIED

23:18.828 --> 23:20.099
ABOUT SOMETHING
LIKE AMPUTATION?

23:20.099 --> 23:22.502
I MEAN, DID SHE EVER MENTION
THAT IT MIGHT BE EVEN A RISK?

23:22.502 --> 23:23.773
NO.

23:23.773 --> 23:25.134
BUT SHE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT IT.

23:25.134 --> 23:28.107
SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IT
WOULD DO TO HER REPUTATION.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.779
(lowered voice) WHAT IS
SHE TALKING ABOUT?

23:29.779 --> 23:32.011
(man) NOW WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT?
I-I HAVE NO IDEA.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.983
I HEARD HER TALKING
IN THE HALLWAY.

23:33.983 --> 23:35.745
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
I COULD HEAR HER.

23:35.745 --> 23:38.688
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

23:38.688 --> 23:41.591
SHE SAID, "I CAN'T BE
THE DOCTOR WHO TURNS

23:41.591 --> 23:43.192
AN OLYMPIC ATHLETE
INTO A DOORSTOP."
(speaks inaudibly)

23:43.192 --> 23:45.825
(gallery gasping and murmuring)

23:45.825 --> 23:47.096
ALL RIGHT, QUIET DOWN!
(banging gavel)

23:47.096 --> 23:48.958
QUIET DOWN, EVERYONE!

23:48.958 --> 23:51.030
QUIET DOWN!

23:51.030 --> 23:52.502
(Arizona) DO WE KNOCK?

23:52.502 --> 23:53.633
NO, THERE'S AN OPEN HOUSE
ON SUNDAY.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.634
WE CAN COME BACK THEN.

23:54.634 --> 23:55.735
OH, OH! THERE'S A SWING SET!

23:55.735 --> 23:58.437
OH, AND A POOL! A POOL!
CALLIE THERE'S A POOL!

23:58.437 --> 23:59.739
OOH! YEAH?

23:59.739 --> 24:01.170
OH, I CAN JUST SEE US

24:01.170 --> 24:03.573
PLAYING WITH THE GIRLS
IN THIS YARD,

24:03.573 --> 24:05.945
HAVING A PICNIC,
AND SWINGING ON THE SWINGS.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.748
OHH. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE'RE HAVING ANOTHER GIRL?

24:08.748 --> 24:10.219
COME ON.

24:10.219 --> 24:12.081
CAN YOU GET OFF OF THAT THING
FOR FIVE SECONDS

24:12.081 --> 24:13.823
AND LOOK AT THIS PLACE?
YEAH, I KNOW,
HOLD ON A SECOND.

24:13.823 --> 24:15.755
I'M JUST, UH, I'M FOLLOWING UP
ON THAT CLINICAL TRIAL

24:15.755 --> 24:17.456
IN GERMANY USING
PETERSON HIP JOINTS.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.758
I'M TRYING TO GET THEM
TO SEND ME THEIR DATA.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.760
WELL, THEY'RE NOT GONNA RELEASE
ANYTHING UNTIL IT'S PUBLISHED.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.032
EH. IT'S WORTH A SHOT.
(typing)

24:23.032 --> 24:25.835
THERE, SENT. ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU
CAN SHOW ME THE SWING SET.

24:25.835 --> 24:26.736
OKAY. OH! OOH.

24:26.736 --> 24:28.197
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

24:28.197 --> 24:29.869
YOU ALL RIGHT?
I GOT IT.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.701
(Travis) I'VE GOT IT.

24:31.701 --> 24:35.244
(whirring)

24:40.610 --> 24:43.482
(whirring stops)

24:51.591 --> 24:53.222
DO YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH,
THE WHOLE TRUTH,

24:53.222 --> 24:54.594
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?

24:54.594 --> 24:57.597
I DO.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.768
HEY, TRAVIS.

24:58.768 --> 24:59.799
HEY.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.501
YOU KNOW, I'M, UH...

25:02.501 --> 25:05.635
I'M THINKING ABOUT SNOWBOARDING.

25:05.635 --> 25:07.737
IN FACT, I PICKED UP A BOARD--
A BURTON BLUNT.

25:07.737 --> 25:09.609
YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT ONE?
THAT'S A GOOD BOARD.

25:09.609 --> 25:10.810
THERE'S BETTER BOARDS
FOR BEGINNERS.

25:10.810 --> 25:11.781
WHAT SIZE SHOE ARE YOU?

25:11.781 --> 25:13.843
I'M A 13.

25:13.843 --> 25:15.685
YOU MIGHT WANNA LOOK
INTO AN EXTRA WIDE,

25:15.685 --> 25:17.116
SO YOUR TOES DON'T HANG OVER
TOO MUCH.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.287
A LITTLE OVER HANG'S FINE,

25:18.287 --> 25:19.889
BUT TOO MUCH IS GONNA
CAUSE DRAG.

25:19.889 --> 25:21.290
AND DRAG'S BAD?
WELL--

25:21.290 --> 25:22.892
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
WHERE'S THIS GOING?

25:22.892 --> 25:25.595
LOOK, I'M SIMPLE CONSULTING
AN EXPERT ON SNOWBOARDING

25:25.595 --> 25:26.726
ABOUT A SNOWBOARD.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.758
I MEAN, WHO SHOULD I TRUST MORE,
THIS GUY OR THE KID

25:28.758 --> 25:30.529
WHO'S HELPING ME OUT
AT R.E.I.?
(gallery laughs)

25:30.529 --> 25:32.061
GET TO THE POINT,
MR. HAMILTON.

25:32.061 --> 25:34.664
TRAVIS, WHEN YOU FIRST MET
DR. TORRES,

25:34.664 --> 25:36.866
DID YOU ASK HER ABOUT
A CERTAIN KIND OF JOINT?

25:36.866 --> 25:38.067
THE PETERSON JOINT.

25:38.067 --> 25:39.969
I'D HEARD IT WAS GOOD
FOR ATHLETES.

25:39.969 --> 25:41.811
YOU KNOW, QUICKER RECOVERY,
BETTER RANGE OF MOTION.

25:41.811 --> 25:45.174
SO YOU WERE CONSULTING
AN EXPERT ON JOINT REPLACEMENT

25:45.174 --> 25:47.046
ABOUT A JOINT.
YEAH.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.218
IS IT TRUE THAT DR. TORRES
HAD NEVER ACTUALLY DONE

25:49.218 --> 25:51.050
AN OPERATION WITH THIS
KIND OF JOINT BEFORE?

25:51.050 --> 25:52.121
IT'S TRUE.

25:52.121 --> 25:53.252
BUT YOU WENT AHEAD
WITH IT ANYWAY.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.854
SHE SAID SHE HAD DONE
A LOT OF RESEARCH.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.085
SHE SAID SHE WAS CONFIDENT.

25:56.085 --> 25:59.729
SO YOU TRUSTED HER TO USE
HER EXPERTISE TO ADVISE YOU,

25:59.729 --> 26:00.790
AND TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

26:00.790 --> 26:04.694
WHEN, IN FACT, WHAT YOU GOT
WAS A BOTCHED SURGERY,

26:04.694 --> 26:06.936
AN INFECTION,
A REVISION SURGERY,

26:06.936 --> 26:08.167
A HEART SURGERY...
(murmuring)

26:08.167 --> 26:11.641
AND... (sighs)

26:11.641 --> 26:13.202
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU NOW.

26:13.202 --> 26:15.705
(Whitney) JUST LET ME PULL UP
THE BLANKET.

26:15.705 --> 26:20.650
WHY? SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM?

26:20.650 --> 26:23.783
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.815
(exhales)

26:25.815 --> 26:27.256
(door slides open)

26:28.658 --> 26:29.959
IS IT HER?

26:33.823 --> 26:35.765
HEY, TRAVIS.

26:35.765 --> 26:36.896
TELL HER TO GO.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.699
I DON'T WANNA SEE HER.
I DON'T WANNA TALK TO HER.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.974
(voice breaks)
UM, I JUST BROUGHT YOU

26:44.974 --> 26:47.336
SOME INFORMATION
ON SUPPORT GROUPS.

26:47.336 --> 26:51.110
UM, TRY TO GET HIM TO GO.
AND, OH, ON THE BACK,

26:51.110 --> 26:52.381
THERE'S A NAME
OF AN INCREDIBLE PROSTHETIST--

26:52.381 --> 26:55.845
TELL HER TO GET OUT.
I TRUSTED HER.

26:55.845 --> 26:59.749
I TRUSTED HER COMPLETELY,
AND...

26:59.749 --> 27:02.321
YOU KNOW, I GET THAT PEOPLE
LIVE WITHOUT LEGS

27:02.321 --> 27:05.154
AND IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD, BUT...

27:05.154 --> 27:08.157
IT'S THE END OF MY WORLD.

27:08.157 --> 27:10.960
I'VE BEEN SNOWBOARDING
SINCE I WAS 5.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.962
I USED TO STEAL
CAFETERIA TRAYS FROM SCHOOL

27:12.962 --> 27:14.764
AND RIDE 'EM DOWN
MY PARENTS' DRIVEWAY.

27:14.764 --> 27:16.836
SNOW OR NO SNOW,
I DIDN'T CARE.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.808
IT WAS THE THING I DID
FOR FUN.

27:18.808 --> 27:21.811
THEN IT BECAME MY JOB
AND MY WORLD.

27:21.811 --> 27:24.073
AND NOW IT'S...
EVERYTHING--

27:24.073 --> 27:26.716
MY FAMILY, MY FRIENDS.

27:26.716 --> 27:28.878
WITHOUT IT...

27:28.878 --> 27:31.951
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.

27:31.951 --> 27:35.254
AND NOW IT'S GONE.
IT'S JUST...

27:35.254 --> 27:38.688
GONE.

27:44.333 --> 27:46.335
AND IT'S DR. TORRES' FAULT.

27:46.335 --> 27:50.439
(murmuring)

27:54.043 --> 27:55.845
YOU FEEL VERY STRONGLY
ABOUT THAT.

27:55.845 --> 27:56.906
IT'S NOT JUST A FEELING.

27:56.906 --> 27:58.908
I KNOW IT. SHE TOLD ME.

27:58.908 --> 28:00.910
WHAT, SHE ADMITTED
THAT SHE WAS AT FAULT?

28:00.910 --> 28:02.081
YES, SHE DID.

28:02.081 --> 28:05.214
THE DAY SHE CUT OFF MY LEGS,
SHE CAME INTO MY ROOM,

28:05.214 --> 28:06.415
SHE'D BEEN CRYING.

28:06.415 --> 28:08.818
SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS SORRY.
OBJECTION!

28:08.818 --> 28:11.120
IT IS ILLEGAL TO USE
A PHYSICIAN'S APOLOGY

28:11.120 --> 28:12.822
AGAINST THEM AS EVIDENCE
OF GUILT.

28:12.822 --> 28:15.164
YOUR HONOR,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE APOLOGY.

28:15.164 --> 28:18.728
THIS IS ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE
SHE SAID WITH THE APOLOGY.

28:18.728 --> 28:20.870
(judge) I'LL ALLOW IT.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.735
TRAVIS, I KNOW
THIS IS GONNA BE PAINFUL

28:25.735 --> 28:29.278
SO YOU TAKE YOUR TIME.

28:29.278 --> 28:32.281
WHAT ELSE DID
DR. TORRES SAY?

28:32.281 --> 28:36.916
SHE SAID IF THERE WAS ANYONE
TO BLAME, IT WAS HER.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.718
SHE SAID THIS NEVER
SHOULD'VE HAPPENED.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.850
SHE SAID
IF THERE WAS ANY WAY

28:40.850 --> 28:42.421
SHE COULD CHANGE THINGS,
SHE WOULD.

28:42.421 --> 28:46.425
THOSE WERE HER EXACT WORDS?

28:46.425 --> 28:49.428
YES, THEY WERE.

28:53.162 --> 28:58.808
THE PROSECUTION RESTS.

28:58.808 --> 29:01.811
(murmuring)

29:10.279 --> 29:11.520
(Sofia fussing)
YES, WE HAD SO MUCH FUN
TODAY. BIG HUGS.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.824
MWAH. I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.
(grunts) I KNOW! (whines)

29:14.824 --> 29:16.926
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, HONEY.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

29:16.926 --> 29:18.427
HEY, YOUR DAD'S MAKING ME
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

29:18.427 --> 29:19.789
YEAH, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GO NOW.

29:19.789 --> 29:20.960
DEFINITELY GO NOW.
YEAH.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.461
BYE!
BYE!

29:22.461 --> 29:24.133
BYE-BYE.
BYE-BYE!

29:24.133 --> 29:28.137
(sighs) THANK YOU FOR NOT
SAYING ANYTHING TO HER.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.172
IF MY GRANDBABY HADN'T BEEN
STANDING RIGHT THERE,

29:33.172 --> 29:34.974
BELIEVE ME,
I WOULD'VE SAID PLENTY.

29:34.974 --> 29:38.077
DAD, DON'T START RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE TO BE IN COURT SOON.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.248
I HAVE TO TAKE THE STAND TODAY,
AND I'M JUST...

29:39.248 --> 29:41.410
YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE BEEN
MARRIED 38 YEARS.

29:41.410 --> 29:43.182
YOU THINK IT'S BEEN EASY?
NO, DON'T.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.253
YOU THINK WE HAVEN'T
HAD TROUBLES?

29:44.253 --> 29:46.355
DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T START COMPARING. DON'T.

29:46.355 --> 29:49.258
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
"GOOD MAN IN A STORM" BALONEY?

29:49.258 --> 29:51.190
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
SHE SHOULD BE HERE

29:51.190 --> 29:52.291
EVERY DAY
TRYING TO FIX IT.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.263
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

29:54.263 --> 29:55.464
OH, NO?
THE HELL IT ISN'T.

29:55.464 --> 29:57.226
SHE HURT YOU. AND NOW
SHE'S TOO MUCH OF A COWARD

29:57.226 --> 29:58.327
TO EVEN--
TO EVEN FACE YOU.

29:58.327 --> 29:59.969
NOW SHE'S RUNNING AWAY
ABANDONING HER FAMILY.

29:59.969 --> 30:02.301
NO, SHE'S NOT RUNNING AWAY,
ALL RIGHT? I KICKED HER OUT.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.133
IT WAS MY CHOICE TO SPLIT UP.
IT WAS MINE.

30:04.133 --> 30:07.006
ALL RIGHT,
SO JUST DROP IT, OKAY?

30:07.006 --> 30:09.278
YOU CHOSE TO BREAK UP
YOUR FAMILY?

30:09.278 --> 30:13.212
DAD, NOT NOW.

30:13.212 --> 30:17.286
DID YOU EVEN TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT?
DAD.

30:17.286 --> 30:18.948
(Callie) I KNEW
WHAT I WAS DOING.

30:18.948 --> 30:21.250
I DID EXTENSIVE RESEARCH
ON THE PETERSON HIP.

30:21.250 --> 30:22.421
I EVEN SPOKE WITH THE TEAM
WHO INVENTED IT.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.895
EVERYONE AGREED THAT TRAVIS
WAS AN IDEAL CANDIDATE.

30:25.895 --> 30:28.357
AND THE SURGERY?
IT WENT SMOOTHLY?

30:28.357 --> 30:33.002
THE CUT POSITION AND THE FEMORAL
RESURFACING WERE PERFECT.

30:33.002 --> 30:34.603
WHAT WASN'T PERFECT?

30:34.603 --> 30:36.365
WELL, AT THE END OF SURGERY,
THE PATIENT DESATTED--

30:36.365 --> 30:39.939
WHICH MEANS HIS OXYGEN LEVEL
WENT DOWN AND HIS HEART

30:39.939 --> 30:43.112
WAS BEATING REALLY FAST,
WHICH IS REALLY DANGEROUS.

30:43.112 --> 30:44.944
WE THOUGHT HE MIGHT
HAVE A CLOT IN HIS LUNGS,

30:44.944 --> 30:47.176
SO IT WAS VITAL WE FINISH
THE SURGERY QUICKLY.

30:47.176 --> 30:48.447
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU LEFT
THE SPONGE.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.548
YES.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.250
AND I WOULD DO IT AGAIN.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.283
(murmuring)

30:55.484 --> 30:57.426
WELL, THE PATIENT'S LIFE
WAS AT RISK.

30:57.426 --> 31:00.629
I-I BELIEVE THAT THE SPONGE
WOULDN'T COMPROMISE THE JOINT.

31:00.629 --> 31:02.491
I MADE A CALL,
AND I WAS RIGHT.

31:02.491 --> 31:03.933
IT WAS THE RIGHT CALL.

31:03.933 --> 31:05.564
SO LEAVING THE SPONGE
WAS DELIBERATE.

31:05.564 --> 31:06.865
NOT A MISTAKE.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.868
YOU WEREN'T BEING CARELESS
OR DISTRACTED.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.140
(water running)

31:11.140 --> 31:12.401
MAKE SURE HIS B.P.
AND O-2 SATS STAY STABLE.

31:12.401 --> 31:15.204
AND BRING ME HIS POST-OP X-RAY.
I WANNA LOCATE THAT SPONGE.

31:15.204 --> 31:17.406
GOT IT.

31:17.406 --> 31:18.577
(Arizona) OH!

31:18.577 --> 31:21.410
YOU MISSED OUR APPOINTMENT.
HMM?

31:21.410 --> 31:24.183
(gasps) OH, DAMN IT!

31:24.183 --> 31:26.255
I-I'M SO SORRY. I--
MY SURGERY WENT LONG,

31:26.255 --> 31:28.257
AND I COMPLETELY FORGOT.
HOW'D IT GO?

31:28.257 --> 31:30.389
I MEAN, I KNOW THE ULTRASOUND'S
JUST A BLOB AT THIS POINT

31:30.389 --> 31:31.560
BUT STILL...

31:31.560 --> 31:33.392
DID YOU GET A PICTURE
OF THE BLOB? (chuckles)

31:33.392 --> 31:37.296
THERE'S NO PICTURE.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.628
AND NO HEARTBEAT.

31:39.628 --> 31:41.300
WHAT?

31:41.300 --> 31:45.174
SHE DID THE ULTRASOUND
AND SHE LOOKED AND SHE LOOKED.

31:45.174 --> 31:47.336
BUT THERE'S NO HEARTBEAT.

31:47.336 --> 31:52.511
(whispers)
WE LOST THE BABY?

31:52.511 --> 31:56.185
(Callie) I REMEMBER THE DAY
VERY CLEARLY.

31:56.185 --> 31:58.247
I WASN'T DISTRACTED.

31:58.247 --> 32:01.350
SURE, I HAD OTHER THINGS
GOING ON.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.292
BIG THINGS, ACTUALLY.

32:03.292 --> 32:06.555
BUT... (sighs) IT'S MY JOB
TO PRIORITIZE MY PATIENT,

32:06.555 --> 32:08.297
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I DID.

32:08.297 --> 32:10.429
I WASN'T FOCUSED
ON ANYTHING OR...

32:10.429 --> 32:13.932
ANYONE OTHER THAN
MY PATIENT.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.104
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THIS EMBOLECTOMY.

32:15.104 --> 32:18.507
DR. YANG WANTED TO DO
THE HEART SURGERY FIRST.

32:18.507 --> 32:20.469
YOU WANTED TO WORK ON
TRAVIS'S LEG.

32:20.469 --> 32:22.671
YES.
WHY?

32:22.671 --> 32:24.273
WELL, HIS FOOT
WAS TURNING GREY,

32:24.273 --> 32:28.177
WHICH IS AN INDICATION THAT
THE LIMB IS STARTING TO DIE.

32:28.177 --> 32:30.449
AND I WANTED TO RESTORE
BLOOD FLOW.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.682
ONCE A LIMB TURNS BLACK,
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

32:33.682 --> 32:35.724
ACCORDING
TO DR. YANG'S TESTIMONY,

32:35.724 --> 32:37.386
SHE WANTED TO GO FIRST
BECAUSE THE INFECTION

32:37.386 --> 32:40.559
HAD MOVED TO TRAVIS'S HEART,
THROWING OUT EMBOLI--

32:40.559 --> 32:45.264
OR CLOTS--ALL OVER HIS BODY.
AND SHE KNEW THAT THE HEART

32:45.264 --> 32:47.436
WOULD KEEP THROWING OUT CLOTS
UNTIL IT WAS REPAIRED. SO--

32:47.436 --> 32:48.597
DO YOU COOK?

32:51.100 --> 32:52.171
UH, A LITTLE.

32:52.171 --> 32:54.743
OKAY,
LET'S SAY YOU'RE COOKING,

32:54.743 --> 32:57.146
AND YOU START A GREASE FIRE
IN YOUR KITCHEN.

32:57.146 --> 33:00.349
AND THEN IT SPREADS
TO YOUR CURTAINS.

33:00.349 --> 33:02.511
WHAT DO YOU DO?

33:02.511 --> 33:04.383
DO YOU PUT OUT
THE GREASE FIRE?

33:04.383 --> 33:05.584
OR DO YOU EXTINGUISH
THE CURTAINS?

33:05.584 --> 33:09.488
WHICH DISASTER DO YOU
TACKLE FIRST?

33:09.488 --> 33:11.260
IF I HADN'T TREATED
THE EMBOLI WHEN I DID,

33:11.260 --> 33:12.691
TRAVIS WOULD'VE LOST
HIS LEG FOR SURE.

33:12.691 --> 33:15.394
I WAS JUST PICKING
WHICH DISASTER TO TACKLE FIRST.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.497
(Callie) I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU'RE
PICKING THIS FIGHT RIGHT NOW!

33:18.497 --> 33:19.768
I'M NOT TRYING
TO PICK A FIGHT.

33:19.768 --> 33:21.630
I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU
HOW I FEEL.

33:21.630 --> 33:23.202
OKAY, WELL,
I FEEL LIKE CRAP, TOO.

33:23.202 --> 33:24.503
OKAY? IT WASN'T JUST
YOUR KID.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.476
I KNOW. I KNOW THAT.

33:30.739 --> 33:34.012
LOOK, WE JUST--WE'LL JUST,
LOOK, WE DON'T--

33:34.012 --> 33:35.144
WE DON'T HAVE TO TRY AGAIN
RIGHT AWAY, ALL RIGHT?

33:35.144 --> 33:36.215
WE CAN WAIT A WHILE
BEFORE WE TRY AGAIN.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.716
NO.
WE--

33:37.716 --> 33:39.388
NO, NO.
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.

33:39.388 --> 33:40.689
WHAT POINT?

33:40.689 --> 33:42.291
I CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER LOSS,
CALLIE.

33:42.291 --> 33:44.323
I CAN'T HANDLE IT!

33:44.323 --> 33:47.326
I CAN'T--I CAN'T THINK ABOUT
THIS RIGHT NOW.

33:47.326 --> 33:52.101
IT'S JUST--IT'S TOO HARD.
IT'S JUST TOO HARD!

33:52.101 --> 33:56.205
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

33:56.205 --> 33:59.508
NOW YOU DON'T WANT
ANOTHER BABY?

33:59.508 --> 34:01.340
ANSWER ME.

34:01.340 --> 34:05.043
I DON'T KNOW.

34:08.347 --> 34:11.180
I HAVE TO GO CHECK
ON MY PATIENT.

34:11.180 --> 34:12.351
TELL HER TO GET OUT!
TRAVIS--

34:12.351 --> 34:15.124
I DON'T WANT HER HERE.
KICK HER OUT, WHIT, NOW!

34:15.124 --> 34:16.625
GOD KNOWS I CAN'T DO IT
BY MYSELF.

34:16.625 --> 34:19.658
SO GET HER THE HELL
OUT OF HERE!

34:19.658 --> 34:22.431
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!
WHY AREN'T YOU DOING ANYTHING?!

34:22.431 --> 34:25.164
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH!
(breathing heavily)

34:25.164 --> 34:28.167
WHITNEY, GO TO THE FAMILY LOUNGE
AND GET A SNACK.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.568
WE NEED A MINUTE, OKAY?

34:43.712 --> 34:46.355
DON'T YOU DARE
TAKE THIS OUT ON HER.

34:46.355 --> 34:50.659
YOU ARE HURT AND ANGRY
AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT

34:50.659 --> 34:51.720
TO FEEL THOSE THINGS.

34:51.720 --> 34:55.264
BUT WHITNEY HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

34:55.264 --> 34:56.825
YOU--YOU WANNA TAKE YOUR CRAP
OUT ON SOMEBODY,

34:56.825 --> 34:58.197
YOU TAKE IT OUT ON ME,
ALL RIGHT? I CAN HANDLE IT.

34:58.197 --> 35:01.570
YOU--YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO BLAME?
THEN BLAME ME. GO ON.

35:01.570 --> 35:04.373
YELL ALL YOU WANT.

35:07.436 --> 35:10.209
THIS NEVER SHOULD'VE HAPPENED
TO YOU.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.340
(voice breaking) AND IF THERE
WERE ANY WAY,

35:11.340 --> 35:14.213
THAT I COULD MAGICALLY
CHANGE THINGS,

35:14.213 --> 35:16.245
BELIEVE ME, I WOULD.

35:16.245 --> 35:20.249
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO.

35:20.249 --> 35:22.291
I WISH I COULD
FIX THIS. (crying)

35:26.525 --> 35:31.500
I TRIED.
I TRIED SO HARD.

35:31.500 --> 35:36.265
(whispers)
I'M SO SORRY, TRAVIS.

35:36.265 --> 35:40.839
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

35:40.839 --> 35:43.272
YES, I APOLOGIZED.

35:43.272 --> 35:46.745
I UNDERSTOOD
WHAT TRAVIS WAS FEELING.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.417
I WENT THROUGH THE SAME THING
WITH MY WIFE.

35:48.417 --> 35:51.180
SHE... SHE LOST HER LEG
LAST YEAR,

35:51.180 --> 35:53.322
AND, UM, IT'S CHANGED US.

35:53.322 --> 35:57.356
(voice breaking) IT'S, UH,
COST US IN WAYS THAT I...

35:57.356 --> 35:59.458
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO UNDERSTAND.

35:59.458 --> 36:02.631
I WOULDN'T WISH
THIS EXPERIENCE ON ANYONE.

36:02.631 --> 36:05.364
AND NOW IT WAS HAPPENING
TO MY PATIENT.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.367
OF COURSE I WAS SORRY.

36:08.367 --> 36:12.170
I STILL AM.
I'M--I'M SO, SO SORRY

36:12.170 --> 36:13.872
THIS HAPPENED TO YOU,
TRAVIS.

36:13.872 --> 36:18.347
TH-THAT MAKES ME HUMAN.
THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME NEGLIGENT.

36:18.347 --> 36:20.549
AND IF I CAN'T FEEL FOR MY
PATIENTS WITHOUT GETTING SUED,

36:20.549 --> 36:23.352
THEN I GUESS I'M JUST GONNA
KEEP ON GETTING SUED,

36:23.352 --> 36:25.254
BECAUSE THAT'S WHO I AM.

36:25.254 --> 36:27.886
I WON'T APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.889
(murmuring)

36:33.562 --> 36:35.924
(chuckles)
DAD, WE'RE HOME.

36:35.924 --> 36:37.496
(Bailey fussing)
WE'RE BACK. OH, I GUESS
HE'S STILL OUT IN THE PARK

36:37.496 --> 36:40.299
WITH THE GIRLS.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.400
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA TAKE

36:41.400 --> 36:42.631
FOR THE JURY
TO COME BACK?

36:42.631 --> 36:46.935
I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE DAYS,
SOMETIMES WEEKS.

36:46.935 --> 36:48.777
WHAT'S THAT?

36:48.777 --> 36:53.542
I THINK IT'S FROM A CLINICAL
TRIAL ON THE PETERSON HIP.

36:53.542 --> 36:55.314
I THOUGHT I NEVER
HEARD BACK.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.746
UH... (muttering)

36:57.746 --> 36:59.217
"ENCLOSED IS THE DATA
YOU REQUESTED.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.819
"BUT PLEASE BE ADVISED,
WE'VE CURRENTLY PUT A STOP

37:00.819 --> 37:03.221
"TO OUR TRIAL.
THERE'VE BEEN FIVE INSTANCES

37:03.221 --> 37:05.954
OF INFECTION CAUSED BY
THE PSEUDOMONAS BACTERIA."

37:05.954 --> 37:10.799
(siren wailing in distance)
"WE'VE TRACED THE SOURCE
BACK TO THE PETERSON JOINT."

37:10.799 --> 37:12.731
WHAT'S THE POSTMARK
ON THAT?

37:12.731 --> 37:15.304
(paper rustles)

37:15.304 --> 37:18.737
THREE WEEKS BEFORE
TRAVIS' SURGERY.

37:23.612 --> 37:24.743
I CAN'T JUST SIT ON THIS.
I HAVE TO TELL THEM, RIGHT?

37:24.743 --> 37:26.515
I WOULDN'T. YOU DIDN'T
WILLFULLY IGNORE ANY DATA.

37:26.515 --> 37:28.847
YOU DIDN'T ACT IRRESPONSIBLY
OR MALICIOUSLY.

37:28.847 --> 37:31.520
YOU WORKED OFF THE INFORMATION
YOU HAD AT THE TIME.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.622
AND THEN
AN ACT OF GOD HAPPENED.

37:33.622 --> 37:35.554
THE LETTER FELL BEHIND
THE BOOKCASE.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.886
IT COULD'VE JUST AS EASILY
GOTTEN LOST IN THE MAIL.

37:37.886 --> 37:39.358
BUT IT DIDN'T.
ACCIDENTS HAPPENS.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.659
(scoffs)
IT'S THE JOB.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.731
THIS ONE HAPPENED IN YOUR
LIVING ROOM, NOT IN THE O.R.

37:42.731 --> 37:45.464
I--YOU KNOW, I-I WAS DISTRACTED.
I-I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.895
I SHOULD'VE FOLLOWED UP
WHEN I NEVER HEARD BACK.

37:46.895 --> 37:48.567
YOU FEEL BAD
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED,

37:48.567 --> 37:49.898
AND ANYBODY WOULD.

37:49.898 --> 37:51.700
BUT THAT ENVELOPE IS NOT
A MAGIC CURE.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.642
IT'S NOT GOING TO GROW
HIS LEGS BACK.

37:53.642 --> 37:55.874
(groans)
BUT WHAT IT COULD DO?
IT COULD SWAY A JURY.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.046
IT COULD MAKE A JURY THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT YOU,

37:58.046 --> 38:00.349
AND THAT COULD
END YOUR CAREER--

38:00.349 --> 38:01.480
NOT BECAUSE
YOU WERE NEGLIGENT

38:01.480 --> 38:03.051
AND NOT BECAUSE
YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG,

38:03.051 --> 38:05.484
BUT BECAUSE YOU FEEL BAD?
BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY?

38:05.484 --> 38:08.587
LET'S NOT CONFUSE EMOTION
WITH FACT.

38:08.587 --> 38:12.290
AND THE FACT IS,
YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.922
(siren wailing in distance)
YES, I DID.

38:13.922 --> 38:16.294
(cell phone rings)

38:16.294 --> 38:18.427
(beep)
HEY.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.400
OKAY. THANKS.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.571

38:22.571 --> 38:24.873

I-IT'S NOT ENOUGH. JUST BECAUSE
SHE SAYS SHE'S SORRY...

40:00.128 --> 40:01.800
YOU'RE MARRIED.
YOU TOOK A VOW.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.433
YOU DON'T WALK AWAY
FROM THAT.

40:04.433 --> 40:06.675
IF THINGS GET HARD,
YOU WORK HARDER.

40:06.675 --> 40:09.708

40:10.809 --> 40:12.511

40:15.183 --> 40:16.545

40:16.545 --> 40:17.746
I CHEATED ON YOUR MOTHER.

40:17.746 --> 40:19.548
(siren wailing in distance)
WHAT?

40:19.548 --> 40:20.949
(sets down glass)
I-I'M SORRY. WHAT?!

40:20.949 --> 40:22.090
A LONG TIME AGO.

40:22.090 --> 40:24.593
WE--WE--WE WERE YOUNG.
I WAS STUPID.

40:24.593 --> 40:25.894
UH...

40:25.894 --> 40:28.056
BUT YOUR MOTHER FOUND IT
IN HER HEART TO FORGIVE ME.

40:28.056 --> 40:30.559
WHY? (scoffs)
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

40:30.559 --> 40:33.832
WHY? BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED WE
WERE STRONGER THAN ONE MISTAKE,

40:33.832 --> 40:36.965
AND I THANK GOD EVERY DAY
SHE DID.

40:36.965 --> 40:40.669
BECAUSE OTHERWISE,
I WOULDN'T HAVE YOU.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.112
38 YEARS.

40:44.112 --> 40:46.074
WE'VE SHARED A LIFE.

40:46.074 --> 40:50.018
AND IT ALL STARTED AFTER
THAT ONE MISTAKE.

40:51.580 --> 40:53.451
NOW THINGS BETWEEN YOU
AND ARIZONA MIGHT NOT WORK OUT.

40:53.451 --> 40:57.155
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO FIX IT.

40:57.155 --> 41:00.058
BUT HOW WILL YOU KNOW
IF YOU NEVER TRY?

41:08.797 --> 41:10.499
(sighs)

41:11.600 --> 41:13.572
(Arizona, singsongy)
JUST A SECOND!

41:13.572 --> 41:15.744
HI--

41:15.744 --> 41:17.245
OH, YOU'RE NOT BRINGING ME
EXTRA PILLOWS.

41:17.245 --> 41:18.947
YOU DID SOMETHING IMPULSIVE,

41:18.947 --> 41:20.879
AND, UH, YOU WERE THINKING
ABOUT YOURSELF.

41:20.879 --> 41:23.952
IT SEEMED RIGHT AT THE TIME,

41:23.952 --> 41:25.714
AND, UH...

41:25.714 --> 41:27.516
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

41:27.516 --> 41:28.987
ONE MISTAKE.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.259
DO WE HAVE TO
GET INTO THIS NOW?
I DID SOMETHING LIKE
THAT TODAY.

41:31.259 --> 41:33.762
OH. OKAY.

41:33.762 --> 41:35.864
LOOK, I HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK,
AND, UH,

41:35.864 --> 41:37.926
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE
SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.

41:37.926 --> 41:40.769
I DON'T NEED AN ANSWER TONIGHT,
BUT I-I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW...

41:43.071 --> 41:44.903
IF YOU'LL COME HOME.

42:03.151 --> 42:07.726
(exhales deeply)

42:07.726 --> 42:10.158
YOU SHOULD GET DRESSED NOW

42:10.158 --> 42:12.000
AND LEAVE.
