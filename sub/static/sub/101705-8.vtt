They even had a nightcap

- Not yet.

He's probably got

you raped my sister?

20:43.067 --> 20:45.113
I know it was you.
I was there too.

20:45.156 --> 20:48.638
- How old were you?
- Nine.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.294
- If I saw you two
walking together,

20:52.338 --> 20:53.382
I'd have thought
you were twins.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.863
- So it's finally
coming back to you?

20:55.906 --> 20:58.126
- Maybe.

20:58.169 --> 21:01.390

what's the word?

21:01.434 --> 21:03.523
My MO.

21:05.176 --> 21:08.441
- Just admit it.
You raped me.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.663
- It's a possibility.

21:13.707 --> 21:16.362
I was drinking a lot then,
so all I can say

21:16.405 --> 21:19.669
is, yeah, sounds familiar.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.858
- I appreciate you coming,
Nora.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.426
- She came here
to hear you out.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.953
- You read all my letters?
- I did.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.346
I only got them this morning.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.826
- All I could do
is write them, Nora.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.784
The rest is out of my control.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.832
I don't mean to sound
like I'm ducking blame.

- I want to listen to her.

Do you have something
you want to say to me?

21:59.883 --> 22:02.625

22:03.409 --> 22:07.456
You remember that night,
how you acted like a good guy?

22:07.500 --> 22:10.329
I thought you were so nice.

22:12.113 --> 22:13.810
And since then,
I've never been able

22:13.854 --> 22:16.247
to trust my own instincts.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.774
You took away my road map.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.778

22:26.519 --> 22:28.434
Thank you for trusting me
enough to be here.

22:28.477 --> 22:31.698
- Don't get ahead of yourself.
- Of course.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.572
Anything else you want
to say to me, Nora?

22:36.616 --> 22:39.096
Please say it.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.622
- And, Jimmy, I think
there were some things

22:42.665 --> 22:46.190
you wanted to say to Nora?
- Right.

22:47.757 --> 22:50.281
Thank you, Chaplain.

22:52.458 --> 22:57.506
Nora, I've traveled a hard path
to get to where I am now.

22:57.550 --> 23:01.641
A lot of soul searching,

23:03.425 --> 23:07.342
And here I am at this table
sitting across from you...

Asking for your forgiveness.

23:13.174 --> 23:16.699
Can you do that?

I'm not ready.

23:19.006 --> 23:20.181
- You don't have to answer.

23:20.224 --> 23:23.837
- Nora, but I am truly sorry.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.851
- You did tell your cousin
not to wave at us

23:37.894 --> 23:40.244
when Xavier gets here, right?
- She's prepped, Carisi.

23:40.288 --> 23:42.464

this guy down.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.481
- Hey.
- Good to see you.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.962

- Of course.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.529
What's going on?

24:03.572 --> 24:06.227
You're upset with me.
- I think you know why.

24:06.270 --> 24:09.622
- Honest to God, I'm not sure.
Whatever it is, just tell me.

24:09.665 --> 24:12.581
Remember we talked about
how important honesty is?

24:12.625 --> 24:13.626
- Okay.

24:13.669 --> 24:16.193
It's about
when we were making out.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.021
Didn't you hear me
say, "slow down"?

24:18.065 --> 24:19.327
- And I did, right?

24:19.370 --> 24:21.808
- At first,
then I changed my mind.

24:21.851 --> 24:24.288
I said, "stop."
Tried to push you away.

24:24.332 --> 24:27.466

But if you're saying
you said that, I believe you.

24:28.945 --> 24:31.600
- And you didn't listen?
- First times are awkward.

24:31.644 --> 24:34.473
- Awkward--I said stop.
You kept going.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.344
- I'm sorry you're upset,

24:36.387 --> 24:37.954
and I don't want
to upset you anymore.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.434
I should probably go.
- Please don't.

I didn't mean to imply--
- She's losing him.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.959

24:43.003 --> 24:47.486

a substantial person.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.053
There was a real spark
between us.

Mr. Gunn.

32:07.142 --> 32:10.058

that you've made good use

32:10.102 --> 32:12.582

32:12.626 --> 32:15.063

on your crime and the effects

32:15.107 --> 32:16.586
that it had on your victim.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.414

by your attempts

32:18.458 --> 32:21.722
at reparations
even within your limited means.

32:21.765 --> 32:23.419

to make a statement--

33:09.639 --> 33:11.250
Nora Anderson.

33:11.293 --> 33:12.642
- We've already
talked privately.

She doesn't need
to forgive me here.

I listened to his apology.

33:29.964 --> 33:33.794
Took me a moment to realize,
but it's all a fake.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.753
The only reason he met
with me is to make sure

33:36.797 --> 33:39.713
I didn't speak
against him today.

33:39.756 --> 33:44.065
What he showed you just now,
the nice guy Jimmy Gunn...

33:44.109 --> 33:46.589

seven years ago.

33:46.633 --> 33:50.941

sensitive, sweet,

33:50.985 --> 33:54.902
someone I could
fall in love with...

33:54.945 --> 33:57.948
until he conned his way
into my apartment,

33:57.992 --> 34:01.430
shoved me down,
called me a bitch,

34:01.474 --> 34:03.998
and then raped me.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.827
And that's the real Jimmy Gunn.

34:08.829 --> 34:13.312
The hatred,
the anger in his eyes.

He--he wanted to destroy me.

Ever since then,

whatever you wanted.

It was like I was invisible.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.936

from then on.

35:55.979 --> 35:59.113

for not protecting you.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.898
I think that's why she
didn't want you to testify.
