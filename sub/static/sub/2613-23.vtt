01:04.697 --> 01:09.502
(phone ringing)

01:09.502 --> 01:11.671
(ringing)

01:11.671 --> 01:15.334
(phone continues ringing)

01:18.611 --> 01:20.340
Grissom.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.512
I'll be right there.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.621
Please tell the doctor that I have to
reschedule

01:28.621 --> 01:31.055
She should be
right with... you.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.312
Any I.D. Yet?

01:52.512 --> 01:55.504
Nothing
but a blanket.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.087
She live here?

02:01.121 --> 02:04.113
We don't know. Patrol called it in.

02:06.126 --> 02:23.276
Well, whoever she is, she's not talking.

02:23.276 --> 02:27.440
I think she just
ratted herself out.

04:00.673 --> 04:03.509
Drug use?

04:03.509 --> 04:05.378
No visible track marks.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.447
Tox screen
came up empty

04:07.447 --> 04:09.148
except for botulin.

04:09.148 --> 04:09.916
Food poisoning?

04:09.916 --> 04:13.253
I'll know more when I
cut open her stomach.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.454
Heard about the rat.

04:14.454 --> 04:16.822
Hope it didn't
have any children.

04:16.822 --> 04:22.328
Take a look at these tiny
puncture wounds in her forehead.

04:22.328 --> 04:24.597
Indicates
repeated injections.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.698
You're sure she's homeless?

04:25.698 --> 04:27.700
Sometimes I'm not sure
of anything.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.225
Educated guess: Beautification.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.006
She was injected
with pig botulism.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.775
Botox...
the ultimate wrinkle cream.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.411
How did it get into
her bloodstream?

04:38.411 --> 04:39.979
Bad doctor.

04:39.979 --> 04:40.780
Missed the muscle.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.950
Shot directly into her
supratrochlear vein.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.885
Amazing the advances
we make in science,

04:45.885 --> 04:48.321
and the primitive uses
we find for them.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.790
People are still animals.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.825
Signs of
possible torture.

04:52.825 --> 04:55.061
A lot of scarring... some old, some new.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.063
What about the crater
in her check?

04:57.063 --> 04:58.798
The dovetail abrasion of the margins

04:58.798 --> 05:02.068
was caused by the scraping
of the handle of some weapon.

05:02.068 --> 05:06.903
Tells me the blade was
completely inserted...
more than once.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.012
There's no ligature marks anywhere.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.276
I'd think she would need to be restrained

05:15.315 --> 05:18.307
Give me a few hours;
I'll know more.

05:20.586 --> 05:23.256
Show and tell.

05:23.256 --> 05:23.990
Who?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.992
Showing but not telling.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.290
I found a day planner
in the shopping cart.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.293
It's written in code.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.299
"'T' to the third power.

05:33.333 --> 05:38.338
C 1023 minus ten
OK equals zero."

05:38.338 --> 05:40.306
Looks like gink work.

05:40.340 --> 05:44.299
It's the kind of thing
speed freaks do when they've been up
for ten days straight,

05:44.344 --> 05:46.312
and they've already
taken apart the radio.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.849
Yeah. I write everything down in shorthand.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.316
Shorthand?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.285
Keeps things in order.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.322
You're not a control freak
or anything?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.517
No.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.027
Sara...

06:01.027 --> 06:04.297
what's a homeless woman
doing with a day planner

06:04.297 --> 06:07.323
and a $300 handbag?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.736
That handbag cost $300?

06:09.736 --> 06:11.328
Yeah.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.339
How'd you know that?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.608
I bought one for
an ex-girlfriend once.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.303
Oh.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.881
Dusty, we got no hits on the fingerprints

06:21.881 --> 06:25.339
and no one fitting her description has been
reported missing.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.054
Oh, she's not missing? She's in my world.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.691
I'm just mirroring some good
cheek on top of some bad cheek.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.318
Okay.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.329
I'll fix her forehead.

06:41.768 --> 06:44.259
And her chin...

06:47.940 --> 06:49.737
What a mess.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.709
I'm going to do
a little cloning here.

06:55.515 --> 06:59.007
She actually had
a really nice complexion.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.958
Perfect porcelain face.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.427
What can you do about the hair?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.763
It's a macro. What kind of hair
do you want her to have?

07:10.763 --> 07:13.065
Blond, like Courtney Love?

07:13.065 --> 07:14.434
Sounds good to me.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.803
Let's give her some eyes...
blue.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.208
I know her from somewhere.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.276
You do?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.437
Yeah.

07:25.978 --> 07:28.412
Why are you showing me this?

07:28.448 --> 07:31.350
The cover girl,
Ashleigh James...

07:31.350 --> 07:34.410
she's your girl in
the shopping cart.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.023
P.D.'s tracking down
her agency now.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.058
Somebody wanted her dead.

07:39.058 --> 07:40.760
Yeah.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.695
They also wanted her ugly.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.007
It's called
gentrification.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.976
It's not doing anything to gentrify them.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.110
Tell that to the mayor.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.712
The landlord's on vacation.

07:59.712 --> 08:00.546
It's a good thing

08:00.546 --> 08:02.982
because he's got a swimming pool
in his basement.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.145
Ashleigh James' apartment.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.020
Who turned
the water off?

08:08.020 --> 08:10.790
The first officer on the scene
found the door open.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.190
After that, he didn't touch a thing.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.854
- Captain? - Yeah? What have you got?

08:40.620 --> 08:44.155
Well, Narcissus would be proud.

08:44.155 --> 08:49.924
Very much a woman,
yet still a little girl.

08:54.934 --> 08:58.404
I thought Doc Robbins
said the victim's tox screen

08:58.404 --> 08:59.539
came back negative.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.905
No, she wasn't a user.

09:03.209 --> 09:07.976
But maybe the boyfriend was.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.510
Let's hope he nick ed himself.

09:14.153 --> 09:16.644
Smells like mint.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.219
Hey.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.196
Find anything?

09:24.196 --> 09:25.527
No. Nothing.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.533
Anything out front?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.058
Just a couple of homeless guys.

09:32.271 --> 09:35.007
You, uh... you sure
this is the vic's?

09:35.007 --> 09:37.635
You are what you eat.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.992
Blood in the sink.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.893
None on the floor.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.707
Enema.

10:07.707 --> 10:10.509
The secret life of women.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.568
Don't generalize.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.580
It's not very scientific of you.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.605
You're right. I'm sorry.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.590
Catherine...

10:34.967 --> 10:36.628
Hey.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.772
Ooh! Pretty girl.

10:44.143 --> 10:49.137
Yeah. Dangerous being
a pretty girl in this town.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.185
Listen to this:

10:53.185 --> 10:57.056
"Babe, he's not
good enough for you.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.225
"He doesn't have
the history we do.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.426
"You mean the world to me.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.896
I know you'll live to regret this decision."

11:03.896 --> 11:06.330
Hmm.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.535
(camera clicks)

12:18.437 --> 12:21.702
Not exactly the victim's style.

12:25.177 --> 12:28.781
What? You don't
like cupcakes?
Candy bar s?

12:28.781 --> 12:30.683
Hey, Griss!

12:30.683 --> 12:32.118
- Grissom! - Hey

12:32.118 --> 12:34.286
- Where's he going? - I don't know.

12:34.286 --> 12:35.253
(whistles)

12:36.756 --> 12:38.524
Somewhere.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.424
Come on.

12:48.634 --> 12:52.297
With eyes afire

13:03.449 --> 13:06.680
I am drawn

13:08.988 --> 13:14.358
I am drawn to her

13:16.162 --> 13:20.332
Like a moth to flame

13:20.332 --> 13:23.893
She leaves me now

13:29.008 --> 13:31.210
Unbound.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.946
What are
you doing here?

13:33.946 --> 13:35.181
Contextualizing.

13:35.181 --> 13:38.484
Shopping cart in the lab
is like a lion in a zoo.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.152
I needed to see it
in its natural habitat.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.121
Question:

13:42.121 --> 13:44.521
How did Ashleigh James

13:44.557 --> 13:46.725
get from her loft
to this underpass?

13:46.725 --> 13:48.488
She didn't walk.

13:48.527 --> 13:51.496
I'm pretty sure
she was pushed.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.806
Grissom...

14:00.840 --> 14:03.240
Is that Ashleigh James?

14:05.778 --> 14:08.547
She was under her
own billboard.

14:08.547 --> 14:10.115
Coincidence?

14:10.115 --> 14:12.709
Somebody was making a point.

14:33.572 --> 14:36.442
Hey.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.841
You like crossword puzzles.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.539
How are you at deciphering codes?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.616
Aren't you putting the shopping cart before

14:43.616 --> 14:46.652
In order
to decipher a code, you need to know the

14:46.652 --> 14:51.055
In order to know the alphabet,
you need to know the author.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.624
So, what's the cart telling us?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.888
About the victim?

15:00.900 --> 15:04.996
Well, the victim had no
relationship to the cart except for the
fact that we found her in it.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.233
I'm more interested in the person who used

15:08.274 --> 15:11.869
Well, aside from the leather day runner and

15:11.911 --> 15:15.314
which appear to be from
Ashleigh James' world... you got mostly
collectibles.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.908
Newspapers, Review Journals, The Sun...

15:18.250 --> 15:21.220
various editions
going back several months.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.586
A couple of tennis
rackets, a broom,

15:23.622 --> 15:25.886
an umbrella, a pot...

15:25.925 --> 15:28.416
I guess some kind of
glove or something.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.831
I stand corrected.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.913
I have a feeling
whoever owned this cart...

15:47.947 --> 15:50.609
was an Ashleigh James fan.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.953
Or a fanatic.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.930
Well, it looks like lover boy isn't home.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.626
Maybe he wrote her a letter and split.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.800
It's trash day.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.935
I don't know, man. We don't even have a

16:13.973 --> 16:16.942
It's on the street. It's fair game.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.768
What did you find?

16:42.768 --> 16:45.202
Photographic paper.

16:59.651 --> 17:02.620
That's Ashleigh James.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.638
The cow says, "Moo."

17:20.638 --> 17:22.003
I can hold my
breath, I swear.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.376
Lola, if you exhale,
you'll burst the bloody seams.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.278
Rod, I'm sorry. I...

17:26.278 --> 17:28.146
The fitting
was two days ago.

17:28.146 --> 17:28.881
Are you telling me

17:28.881 --> 17:31.750
you couldn't keep your face
out of the trough

17:31.750 --> 17:32.818
for48 hours?

17:32.818 --> 17:34.253
You want me
to be your agent,

17:34.253 --> 17:37.017
then start doing
your part, all right?

17:38.424 --> 17:39.789
Rod Darling?

17:40.592 --> 17:41.827
Las Vegas Police.

17:41.827 --> 17:44.396
You're here
about Ashleigh, right?

17:44.396 --> 17:44.997
Yeah.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.800
Sorry about what happened, but she wasn't

17:47.800 --> 17:49.392
I drop ped her a
couple of months ago.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.936
Did you forget to pack?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.773
We found men's clothing
and personal items at her place.

17:54.773 --> 17:58.177
She was a screwed-up kid
looking for a father figure.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.345
One minute, booking a photo shoot.

18:00.345 --> 18:03.576
The next minute,
she's screaming for Daddy.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.820
You son of a bitch!

18:07.820 --> 18:09.121
Come on, that's enough.

18:09.121 --> 18:11.690
He killed her! He killed her!

18:11.690 --> 18:13.749
He's a psycho!

18:15.094 --> 18:17.062
Rod did everything he could

18:17.096 --> 18:20.466
to make her dependent on him,
and only him.

18:20.466 --> 18:22.201
She shut me out.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.066
Is that why you

18:24.103 --> 18:25.904
tore up her photograph

18:25.904 --> 18:27.769
and tossed it in the trash?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.432
You just don't get it, do you?

18:29.475 --> 18:32.069
No, I don't.
I mean, I don't know.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.079
I care about a woman,
I put her picture in a frame...

18:34.113 --> 18:36.081
maybe put it on my desk...

18:36.115 --> 18:39.448
but to tear it up and throw it in the garbage
with old cole slaw...

18:39.518 --> 18:41.884
that just doesn't say "love"
to me.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.190
If you were in love
with an amazing woman,

18:45.190 --> 18:47.090
and you knew

18:47.126 --> 18:50.796
she was throwing away everything
that was amazing about her

18:50.796 --> 18:53.094
on some scum...

18:53.132 --> 18:57.091
would you still want her picture
on your desk?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.037
What did you use
to cut up the picture?

18:59.037 --> 19:01.106
Same knife you
were waving
around at Rod?

19:01.106 --> 19:04.803
The same knife you used
to cut up Ashleigh's face?

19:05.511 --> 19:06.411
If you're suggesting

19:06.411 --> 19:08.180
I was sleeping with her,
I wasn't.

19:08.180 --> 19:11.016
You run out of drawer space
in your place?

19:11.016 --> 19:13.109
I was protecting my asset.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.854
I don't know what that means.

19:15.854 --> 19:16.488
(sighs)

19:16.488 --> 19:18.056
You can't drive a mile
in this town

19:18.056 --> 19:20.490
without seeing her face
on a billboard,

19:20.559 --> 19:23.119
on the side of a bus, up in lights.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.130
The mantra in
this business

19:25.164 --> 19:29.123
is you protect what's bankable
in this business.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.171
So you didn't sleep with her. You just

19:32.171 --> 19:36.308
You brought a change of clothes, razor
blade, toothbrush,

19:36.308 --> 19:36.909
Yeah.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.044
She needed constant attention...
supervision.

19:39.044 --> 19:43.572
Leave her alone for a minute...
fill in the blank.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.121
I got crabs.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.153
Excuse me?

19:52.191 --> 19:55.490
I got crabs. Take a look.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.162
Phthirus pubis.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.168
Feeds on human blood.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.437
They prefer the pubic and perianal regions

20:05.437 --> 20:09.208
because their legs are adapted to grasp

20:09.208 --> 20:12.109
They don't usually nest in clothing.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.879
But, when the clothing is being worn

20:13.879 --> 20:16.177
by someone with substandard personal

20:16.215 --> 20:18.183
Like one of the victim's neighbors.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.219
We have a high-end handbag found

20:20.219 --> 20:21.987
in a street person's shopping cart,

20:21.987 --> 20:24.182
a jacket covered in crabs

20:24.223 --> 20:26.953
in a closetful of designer clothes. What

20:27.226 --> 20:29.094
Tells me the victim not only had a visitor,

20:29.094 --> 20:31.187
but that visitor was most likely homeless.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
Tells me that whoever is missing
a shopping cart

20:33.232 --> 20:35.564
is also missing his jacket.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.628
Good stuff in here.

21:06.565 --> 21:09.501
Hey, you got a smoke?

21:09.501 --> 21:11.203
No. Sorry.

21:11.203 --> 21:14.434
So, what good are you?

21:15.707 --> 21:17.809
It depends.

21:17.809 --> 21:18.910
Oh, hey.

21:18.910 --> 21:23.315
Don't even think that you can play me, my

21:23.315 --> 21:24.683
I'm not playing.

21:24.683 --> 21:28.779
I got a gal named Sara, and she would love

21:30.422 --> 21:31.890
What do you say?

21:31.890 --> 21:34.950
Trade me.

21:35.527 --> 21:37.791
Yeah. What the hell.

21:47.072 --> 21:48.807
Hey.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.008
Hey. Hey, mister.

21:50.008 --> 21:51.476
Hey, mister, that
is Tookie's scarf.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.312
That is his scarf.
I gave it to him.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.146
That is Tookie's.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.315
Are you a taker, or are
you a giver, mister?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.050
I'm a trader.

21:58.050 --> 22:01.281
I traded Tookie my jacket
for this scarf.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.156
Yeah, and fleas can tell time.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.091
I think fleas can
tell time.

22:06.091 --> 22:08.389
(muttering)

22:09.428 --> 22:11.229
That's a nice ring.

22:11.229 --> 22:14.756
I'll trade you.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.332
I'll trade your kit too

22:22.174 --> 22:23.971
Ow.

22:26.712 --> 22:29.848
Now I can see
what the dark looks like.

22:29.848 --> 22:33.181
I've been trying
to do that for years.

22:40.492 --> 22:43.028
Greg ran the blood
on this scarf.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.325
It matches the victim's.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.331
How about the blood
on the knife?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.934
Yeah, we got a
match, too, but it's not the vic's.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.333
Yeah, McBride

22:50.369 --> 22:53.372
clip ped Rod Darling's right hand
during his little hissy fit.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.106
Blood's his.

22:54.106 --> 22:59.100
And McBride's knife does not
match these wounds.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.272
(sighs)

23:03.382 --> 23:05.350
The tools of the trade.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.352
The weapons of beauty.

23:07.386 --> 23:11.256
Yeah. If people inflicted
as much torture as women inflict upon

23:11.256 --> 23:13.058
there would be lawsuits.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.061
Someone forgot to clean these,
too, for a long time.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.393
Positive for blood
all over the place.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.436
Grissom...

23:24.436 --> 23:26.405
I, uh... ran the DNA

23:26.405 --> 23:28.540
on the epithelials
from the homeless lady's ring.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.075
Cassie's?

23:30.075 --> 23:31.510
It's like
Prince
and the Pauper.

23:31.510 --> 23:33.375
No. Princess and the Pauper.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.280
The princess is a dead supermodel.

23:35.280 --> 23:35.914
Yeah.

23:35.914 --> 23:39.714
And her pauper sister could
be the killer.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.577
Hot dog?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.529
Relish?

23:50.529 --> 23:55.398
No. With all those
preservatives? No, no, no.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.402
I... I don't want
to be preserved,

23:57.436 --> 23:59.404
thank you very much. No.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.769
I mean,
do you know what...

24:00.806 --> 24:03.108
what relish can do
to your insides, huh?

24:03.108 --> 24:04.405
I'd have to investigate.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.877
Yeah, well, you know,
you should.

24:05.877 --> 24:06.711
I mean, you know,

24:06.711 --> 24:09.407
because our insides...
they can kill us.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.983
So, you're pretty careful
about what you eat?

24:11.983 --> 24:14.052
Yeah, you know,
you-you have to be
careful, you know,

24:14.052 --> 24:15.821
'cause what goes
down, you know,

24:15.821 --> 24:17.289
it's got to come out.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.957
It's got to come up.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.125
Out.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.226
(chuckles)

24:21.226 --> 24:23.662
Newton's theory twisted again.

24:23.662 --> 24:26.426
Everybody's twisted.

24:29.267 --> 24:30.902
How about your sister?

24:30.902 --> 24:33.271
My... my sister
didn't have a sister.

24:33.271 --> 24:34.840
Protein's good,
you know?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.341
Carb...carbs are bad.

24:36.341 --> 24:37.576
This is bad.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.066
That's bad.

24:42.881 --> 24:47.452
Hey, Cassie, you know that scarf
you gave Tookie?

24:47.452 --> 24:49.443
Yeah, I know it.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.150
Did your sister give that
to you, or...

24:52.491 --> 24:55.221
did you steal it from her?

24:55.494 --> 24:57.729
I should have stole it.

24:57.729 --> 25:01.533
Because sh-sh-she stole from me.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.434
What did she steal from you?

25:05.504 --> 25:08.496
My life.

25:13.445 --> 25:16.147
I admit I gave up on Cassie.

25:16.147 --> 25:17.182
Washed my hands.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.018
Ashleigh was the only one
who still gave a damn.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.420
Get together with her
every couple of weeks...

25:22.420 --> 25:26.525
make sure she had a decent meal,
shower, clothes on her back.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.493
And what did you do
for her?

25:28.527 --> 25:30.495
Let me
tell you something.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.520
For every piece of meat,
there has to be a butcher.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.233
So, you led her
to the slaughter?

25:35.233 --> 25:36.067
Free will.

25:36.067 --> 25:38.900
Recognize this one?

25:39.538 --> 25:42.029
That's Cassie.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.305
It's the homeless sister.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.512
How long ago
was this taken?

25:47.546 --> 25:48.513
Three years.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.283
See, Cassie got deep
into freebase.

25:51.283 --> 25:54.514
No shortage of sleazebags around
to keep her supplied.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.522
I knew she had the sister
in Wichita Falls.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.291
All right, Cassie,
let's go.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.458
Come on,
chin up, chin up.

26:00.458 --> 26:03.428
Colin, will you get in
there and get her hair out of her face?

26:03.428 --> 26:05.730
Don't touch me! I hate this!

26:05.730 --> 26:06.998
I hate this place!

26:06.998 --> 26:08.033
I hate it!

26:08.033 --> 26:08.867
I hate this place!

26:08.867 --> 26:10.232
Get away from me!

26:19.578 --> 26:21.546
One look...

26:21.580 --> 26:23.548
and that was it.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.550
Camera ate her up.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.553
So, in Cassie's mind,
she was a victim here.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.555
Makes sense that she'd be angry.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.557
Angry was five flights up.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.559
Cassie was an obsessed basehead.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.561
Cocaine already
had her paranoid.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.330
Once Ashleigh
started modeling,

26:38.330 --> 26:40.560
everything became
this big conspiracy.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.634
Naturally,
yours truly was Satan.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.235
Cassie threw her life away,

26:44.235 --> 26:46.371
and her sister Ashleigh
recycled it.

26:46.371 --> 26:48.974
It's like a crossword
puzzle, isn't it?

26:48.974 --> 26:51.443
Once you pick it up,
you can't put it down.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.544
And go home? No way.

26:52.544 --> 26:56.281
You know, this Day Runner
belonged to Ashleigh.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.183
"BFJ3".

26:58.183 --> 27:00.583
BF: Bellagio fountain.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.590
J3? Date?

27:05.590 --> 27:07.859
January 3rd?
June 3rd? July 3rd?

27:07.859 --> 27:10.528
Uh... third "J" month? July?

27:10.528 --> 27:12.163
That's what I
thought at first.

27:12.163 --> 27:14.332
Parking space
in a parking garage?

27:14.332 --> 27:17.135
Nope. Once you pick it up,
you can't put it down.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.770
J3... J3...

27:18.770 --> 27:21.306
City or state grid map?

27:21.306 --> 27:22.603
You're cold.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.610
What's one thing
a model always knows?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.112
Who's shooting her.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.780
Three Js. Jay Jay Jarrett.

27:28.780 --> 27:29.748
Who?

27:29.748 --> 27:31.416
Famous photographer.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.318
Compliments of P. D:

27:33.318 --> 27:35.587
Ashleigh James's
employment contracts
for the last year.

27:35.587 --> 27:36.611
And, as an aside,

27:36.655 --> 27:39.324
she stopped working
two months ago.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.125
Why?

27:40.125 --> 27:42.327
Good question.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.161
)
Sighs
(

27:43.161 --> 27:46.995
Maybe the answer
is in one of these pages.

27:50.869 --> 27:54.839
Nobody could blame you
for being mad, Cassie.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.609
I mean, your sister
took your career,

27:57.609 --> 27:59.911
and you wanted
to get back at her.

27:59.911 --> 28:03.081
If you couldn't have success,
she couldn't either.

28:03.081 --> 28:03.948
Isn't that right?

28:03.948 --> 28:07.519
The victims have victims, too.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.654
So, which one of you
is the victim?

28:09.654 --> 28:14.392
I-I know... you know,
I know, I tried to warn her.

28:14.392 --> 28:16.027
About the in-in
and-and outing

28:16.027 --> 28:18.229
and the...
and the pick- pick.

28:18.229 --> 28:19.864
And the-and the
and the counting

28:19.864 --> 28:21.354
the counting and the counting.

28:21.399 --> 28:22.661
I mean, I did, I tried.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.270
That's why I tried to really,
really save her. I mean, I tried to save her.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.338
You tried to save her? Your sister?

28:27.338 --> 28:29.374
Right. She could
never be, you know...

28:29.374 --> 28:31.672
she could never be...
pretty enough.

28:31.710 --> 28:35.046
And she could never
b-be...
skinny
enough.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.549
And sh-she could never be...
perfect enough.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.144
And sh-she could never be
any-anything enough.

28:43.922 --> 28:45.719
Hey, fat girl.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.693
I got what you need.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.388
I got it.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.369
You all right?

28:58.369 --> 28:59.996
One more.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.640
Good girl.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.009
I mean, that's why I did, I did.

29:05.009 --> 29:06.878
I tried to stop her.

29:06.878 --> 29:09.938
(choked up)
I tried to stop her.

29:11.282 --> 29:14.217
I tried to stop.

29:18.389 --> 29:22.655
(whimpering)

29:25.764 --> 29:28.366
She's a needle freak. She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

29:28.366 --> 29:29.667
Yes, she does.

29:29.667 --> 29:30.802
(moans)

29:30.802 --> 29:34.038
You tried to stop yourself,
didn't you?

29:34.038 --> 29:35.173
But you couldn't.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.342
(yelling incoherently)

29:37.342 --> 29:39.377
It's you! It's you!

29:39.377 --> 29:40.311
(yelling)

29:40.311 --> 29:41.613
(yelling)

29:41.613 --> 29:45.379
That's enough!
Read her her rights.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.764
I found blisters in
the back of her throat.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.766
What? Forced oral?

30:01.766 --> 30:03.757
That's what I thought

30:03.802 --> 30:07.472
until I noticed worn
enamel on the tooth

30:07.472 --> 30:11.242
in conjunction
with this red mark

30:11.242 --> 30:13.767
on the knuckle
of her middle finger,

30:13.812 --> 30:16.781
which made me realize
it wasn't sexual abuse.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.477
Eating disorder.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.889
She was bulimic and anorexic.

30:24.889 --> 30:28.426
Which explains
the down on her skin.

30:28.426 --> 30:29.861
Lanugo.

30:29.861 --> 30:33.661
Characteristic of premature
babies and anorexics.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.502
She doesn't seem that skinny.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.837
Not this week.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.406
Last week, or the week before,
who knows?

30:41.406 --> 30:42.273
Binge -and- purge.

30:42.273 --> 30:45.176
Till her entire system
is in a state of shock.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.044
You know what's next.

30:46.044 --> 30:48.808
Body starts feeding
on its own muscle.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.815
Is that what killed her?

30:50.849 --> 30:55.687
Uh... starvation and purging
weaken the immune system.

30:55.687 --> 30:59.390
But cause of death: Failed
kidney, fueled by septicemia.

30:59.390 --> 31:00.857
Blood infection.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.928
Caused by the injuries
to her face?

31:03.928 --> 31:07.131
Probably, but she's been septic
for at least a month.

31:07.131 --> 31:09.434
She has anemia
borne of chronic disease.

31:09.434 --> 31:12.537
Her red cell count's low,
iron's low.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.835
ESR is extremely high.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.841
So she didn't just die.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.867
She's been dying
for a long time.

31:30.221 --> 31:33.091
(knocking on door)

31:33.091 --> 31:35.787
What do you know that's good?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.864
Cassie James' psych profile.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.903
Classic paranoid schizophrenic.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.272
Which explains why
the interrogation room

31:47.272 --> 31:48.172
was too hard on her.

31:48.172 --> 31:51.175
For schizophrenics,
you know, the tighter the space,

31:51.175 --> 31:53.578
the more unbearable
the feelings can become.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.445
Well, if you ask me,

31:54.445 --> 31:57.248
that's not the only
psych evaluation we need.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.049
Ashleigh James?

31:58.049 --> 31:59.117
(sighs)
That poor girl.

31:59.117 --> 32:02.520
Definitely lacking
in the self-image department.

32:02.520 --> 32:07.558
She suffered from septicemia,
indicative of chronic abuse.

32:07.558 --> 32:09.794
But...
what if Cassie

32:09.794 --> 32:13.398
wasn't the one who inflicted
Ashleigh's facial wounds?

32:13.398 --> 32:16.000
Well, we know it's not
the ex-boyfriend...

32:16.000 --> 32:16.701
no evidence.

32:16.701 --> 32:20.271
Not the agent...
wouldn't jeopardize an asset.

32:20.271 --> 32:24.409
And, if it's not Cassie,
who's left?

32:24.409 --> 32:26.775
I don't know.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.465
(sighs)

32:47.465 --> 32:51.799
T/3. 1834 BC.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.798
48 BF.

33:16.561 --> 33:18.997
T 3...

33:18.997 --> 33:23.034
1834 BC...

33:23.034 --> 33:25.662
48 BF.

33:33.044 --> 33:39.017
2 evo'd... 8G...

33:39.017 --> 33:40.917
1 TU.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.523
You must have been so desperate.

33:50.395 --> 33:53.531
Cassie James' prints
from Booking on the left.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.901
Prints from the loft faucet on the right.

33:56.901 --> 33:59.995
Do we have a prom date?

34:04.075 --> 34:06.703
All right, well...

34:09.647 --> 34:14.777
Cassie James was
definitely in her
sister's apartment.

34:16.219 --> 34:19.791
Hey, man.
What you eatin'?

34:19.791 --> 34:21.690
Little college cuisine.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.056
That stuff will
kill you, you know.

34:23.094 --> 34:24.795
Hasn't killed me yet.

34:24.795 --> 34:28.027
Greggo, find any time between meals to

34:28.065 --> 34:30.068
You mean Ashleigh's
fingernail scrapings?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.735
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.036
And?

34:33.036 --> 34:34.205
Got a match.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.139
To Cassie, her sister.

34:36.139 --> 34:37.475
No. To the vic.

34:37.475 --> 34:38.737
Ashleigh?

34:39.077 --> 34:42.513
Yeah. The DNA under her
fingernails was her own.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.246
Excuse me.

34:45.116 --> 34:49.087
So what I realized was
bulimia is a zero sum disease.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.289
That's why she has a plus sign
over here

34:51.289 --> 34:53.024
and a minus sign over there.

34:53.024 --> 34:56.050
Whatever went in
had to be exactly canceled

34:56.094 --> 34:57.862
by what went out.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.057
You're talking about BDD:

35:00.098 --> 35:02.066
Body Dysmorphic Disorder.

35:02.066 --> 35:04.635
Yes. One theory suggests
it's neurobiological.

35:04.635 --> 35:05.503
Another, psychological...

35:05.503 --> 35:09.040
that people with extreme sexual
or emotional anxiety

35:09.040 --> 35:10.975
unconsciously displace
their feelings

35:10.975 --> 35:14.112
into the arena of appearance,
because it's more manageable.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.081
You feel like crap,
blame your face.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.083
Or your skin,
or your hair

35:19.117 --> 35:21.252
or that zit
on your forehead.

35:21.252 --> 35:22.053
I knew this dancer.

35:22.053 --> 35:25.456
Every night, she'd stare
at herself in the mirror
for three hours.

35:25.456 --> 35:28.626
Meticulous groom ing,
when a person suffers from BDD,

35:28.626 --> 35:30.828
becomes
a destructive compulsion.

35:30.828 --> 35:32.897
There's one line
in her daybook

35:32.897 --> 35:35.092
that keeps repeating
over and over

35:35.133 --> 35:37.101
and over again: "I'm not even."

35:37.135 --> 35:40.104
So you're saying she knew
she was slipping.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.107
No. She literally means even.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.109
A large number of BDD sufferers

35:45.143 --> 35:46.878
are convinced that
they're not symmetric.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.881
That one side of their body or their face

35:49.881 --> 35:52.111
All animals prefer symmetry
in their mates.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.086
The male Japanese scorpion flies
with the most symmetrical wing s

35:55.086 --> 35:56.287
gets the most mates.

35:56.287 --> 35:57.488
So, really,

35:57.488 --> 35:59.924
we're not talking about
being beautiful at all.

35:59.924 --> 36:00.791
In terms of entomology,

36:00.791 --> 36:03.123
being beautiful
is about being even.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.130
It signals the fitness
to procreate.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.132
So, we're not really
talking about looks.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.835
We're talking about
survival of the species?

36:10.835 --> 36:12.132
The bottom line
is the same:

36:12.170 --> 36:14.839
Control and perfectionism.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.864
That's what her
code was all about.

36:20.011 --> 36:27.852
Let's take "HBWC/3, 1590 BC,
90 BF, 3930 S, 114 TC."

36:27.852 --> 36:30.121
Three hamburgers with cheese.

36:30.121 --> 36:33.925
Content 530. 530 times three

36:33.925 --> 36:36.155
is where she gets 1590 BC.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.863
That's BC for "bad calories."

36:38.863 --> 36:40.531
And, at 30 gram s a pop,

36:40.531 --> 36:42.266
90 grams of BF.

36:42.266 --> 36:43.467
Bad fat?

36:43.467 --> 36:44.535
Yeah.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.162
The rest of her formula

36:46.204 --> 36:48.172
involves sodium,
total carbohydrates

36:48.206 --> 36:51.175
and the actual weight
of everything she ate.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.177
And so,
she was, uh...

36:53.211 --> 36:55.179
operating like a scientist,

36:55.213 --> 36:58.182
seeking a perfect formula
to take her pain away.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.184
Or disappear altogether.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.187
Which brings me to
the minus side of her equation.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.122
She would write down
the number of times

37:05.122 --> 37:09.183
she t'u'd, threw up,
in this case twice... or evo'd.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.895
"Evo'd"?

37:10.895 --> 37:12.192
Moving her bowels.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.198
The directions
on her disposable enema box

37:14.198 --> 37:15.893
use the term "evacuate".

37:15.933 --> 37:18.169
So, after
her burger binge,

37:18.169 --> 37:23.107
she "3 evo'd, 14 G,
2 t'u'd, 9 G, 3 #1."

37:23.107 --> 37:24.574
She evo'd three times,

37:24.609 --> 37:27.203
but her calculations
didn't stop there.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.214
"G" stands for grams.

37:35.886 --> 37:37.655
14 gram... Wait a minute.

37:37.655 --> 37:39.957
You're telling me that
she weighed her bowel...?

37:39.957 --> 37:41.117
Yeah.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.092
We bag ged it.

37:47.131 --> 37:49.133
Input and output

37:49.133 --> 37:51.226
down to the last quarter gram.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.138
Well, that makes sense
why the blood and skin

37:54.138 --> 37:57.942
under Ashleigh James's
fingernails is a perfect match to Ashleigh

37:57.942 --> 37:59.933
She attacked herself.

38:00.478 --> 38:02.241
I mean, Ashleigh was convinced

38:02.280 --> 38:04.248
that everything about her
needed to be fixed.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.017
But the real problem
was inside her head.

38:06.017 --> 38:09.248
She couldn't deal with that, so she tried
to fix the outside.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.257
Hence, the digging and picking
and purging and bleeding.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.026
To us, it would be torture.

38:15.026 --> 38:19.196
To her... some sort of release.

38:19.196 --> 38:22.366
Which is why Rod cut her loose.

38:22.366 --> 38:24.960
She was no longer bankable.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.971
Also why Frank was so angry
at Rod.

38:28.005 --> 38:30.875
Yeah, he destroyed
Frank's vision of her.

38:30.875 --> 38:34.211
So the victim and the killer
became one and the same.

38:34.211 --> 38:37.214
The very nature
of addiction...

38:37.214 --> 38:39.273
whether it be self- medicating
or self- mutilating...

38:39.317 --> 38:41.979
is that the very behavior
we use to survive it

38:42.019 --> 38:44.283
becomes the behavior
that ends up killing us.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.291
But wait. That
still doesn't answer

38:47.325 --> 38:51.284
how Ashleigh ended up in
a shopping cart by the freeway.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.991
Well, the fingerprints
explain that.

39:08.612 --> 39:10.978
(crying)

39:14.919 --> 39:17.717
I think Cassie was trying
to take care of her sister.

39:18.723 --> 39:22.124
She pushed her to a place where she
thought

39:22.360 --> 39:25.062
Where she thought
she could see herself

39:25.062 --> 39:27.292
for how beautiful
she really was.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.374
What happened to these girls?

39:49.387 --> 39:52.022
I'm sorry about your sister,
Cassie.

39:52.022 --> 39:54.125
The dead don't bleed.

39:54.125 --> 39:58.619
True. Death does have
some advantages.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.366
Would you like me to help you
get into a shelter?

40:02.366 --> 40:05.136
No. I would need shelter
from the shelter.

40:05.136 --> 40:08.172
No, no, no. Out here,
I can hunt and I can range

40:08.172 --> 40:10.367
and I can find the things that I need
out here.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.367
I mean, you never know
what you need until you find it.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.074
Or until you lose it.

40:19.083 --> 40:23.087
I mean, all we are
is what we try
to get rid of.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.189
Fat and newspapers

40:25.189 --> 40:28.092
and loneliness
and cat food cans.

40:28.092 --> 40:31.162
And there are going-away people
and there are left-behind people

40:31.162 --> 40:32.463
but, you know,
everybody's secrets...

40:32.463 --> 40:35.364
everybody's secrets
are the same.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.701
Were you and your sister's
secrets the same?

40:37.701 --> 40:40.397
My sister didn't
have secrets. Her secrets had her.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.407
That... I told you I didn't...
I don't know.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.410
I mean, you know, y-y-you-you
can pick through a million lives

40:46.444 --> 40:49.311
and never have one of your own.

40:52.016 --> 40:55.619
Looking for things,
analyzing them...

40:55.619 --> 40:59.557
trying to figure out the world...
that's a life.

40:59.557 --> 41:03.461
You never know what you
need until you find it.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.728
And, the next
thing I find,

41:04.728 --> 41:08.966
it might be the thing
that changes everything.

41:08.966 --> 41:13.337
What will you do
when you find it?

41:13.337 --> 41:16.040
Sleep...

41:16.040 --> 41:20.033
the most perfect sleep.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.916
(muttering)

42:21.705 --> 42:25.197
(muted tires screeching)

42:32.483 --> 42:37.655
Obviously, most of crime scene
investigation is about seeing.

42:37.655 --> 42:41.025
But much of it
is about hearing, as well.

42:41.025 --> 42:42.192
Listening.

42:42.192 --> 42:43.523
Knowing how to listen.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.230
Not just to what people
are saying,

42:46.230 --> 42:48.221
but how they say it.

42:48.566 --> 42:51.068
How their tone of voice matches
their facial expressions

42:51.068 --> 42:52.570
or body posture.

42:52.570 --> 42:59.310
So, even if I read lips,
and know
what
they're saying...

42:59.310 --> 43:02.012
it's not enough.

43:02.012 --> 43:04.537
We're both scientists,
Mr. Grissom,

43:04.582 --> 43:07.244
so let me
tell you the science.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.620
You've got otosclerosis.

43:09.620 --> 43:12.323
Basically, this means
a bony growth

43:12.323 --> 43:15.554
has begun to form around
the base of the stapes.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.829
What this does is prevent
the stapes from moving

43:18.829 --> 43:21.498
and passing vibrations
to the inner ear,

43:21.498 --> 43:25.169
effectively neutralizing
sound waves.

43:25.169 --> 43:27.771
It's hereditary...
my mother.

43:27.771 --> 43:29.363
Most doctors think so.

43:29.607 --> 43:33.566
But there's no way to know when it's going

43:33.611 --> 43:36.847
and there's no way to reverse it
once it does.

43:36.847 --> 43:38.576
Right.

43:41.852 --> 43:44.184
How long, do you think?

43:45.656 --> 43:48.216
I don't have that answer.
