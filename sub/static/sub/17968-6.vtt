00:53.094 --> 00:54.727
Excuse me.

00:54.813 --> 00:56.179
Excuse me!

00:56.264 --> 00:58.014
Hey... excuse me.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.265
Excuse me!

01:01.352 --> 01:04.187
You guys sound so good.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.322
I'm a record producer, and I've
been looking for two drummers

01:06.357 --> 01:07.990
for a project that I'm starting.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.243
Oh my god.

01:10.328 --> 01:12.662
- This is it.
- Are you serious?

01:12.697 --> 01:14.697
No, I'm not serious.

01:14.749 --> 01:16.666
I work here, and I need you guys to leave.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.169
Time to go.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.589
Four! Four!

01:31.766 --> 01:33.883
I love "Scarface," dude.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.434
We just watched that.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.636
Cocaine and incest, baby.

01:36.721 --> 01:37.720
Can't get enough.

01:37.772 --> 01:39.272
Wait, what about "Food, Inc."?

01:39.357 --> 01:40.640
That's supposed to be
like really life-changing

01:40.725 --> 01:43.059
and eye-opening and like a
really important film to see

01:43.144 --> 01:44.610
about where our food comes from and stuff.

01:44.696 --> 01:48.064
And then the whole corn issue.

01:48.116 --> 01:50.983
Sometimes it's the less you
know, though... you know?

01:51.069 --> 01:52.068
No.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.452
Dude, I wonder what kind of food

01:53.538 --> 01:54.754
they're going to have
at the dog wedding today.

01:54.789 --> 01:56.038
Let's watch the e-vite again.

01:56.124 --> 01:57.173
Yeah!

02:05.683 --> 02:06.933
I love it!

02:06.968 --> 02:08.800
It really is a masterpiece.

02:08.853 --> 02:09.801
Oh my god.

02:09.887 --> 02:11.304
Why is that shot in there?

02:11.356 --> 02:13.439
It's animated, it didn't
need to be in there at all.

02:14.559 --> 02:15.975
Not to be like a downer

02:16.027 --> 02:19.278
but did you know that
people steal people's dogs

02:19.314 --> 02:20.563
and then sell them?

02:20.648 --> 02:22.865
There's a "Judge Judy" episode
about that where this guy is

02:22.951 --> 02:25.451
like reunited with his dog, who was taken.

02:25.486 --> 02:27.486
- Yes, baby boy!
- Yes!

02:27.538 --> 02:29.405
Wait, is "Judge Judy" still on right now?

02:29.490 --> 02:31.240
We should watch that.

02:33.661 --> 02:35.161
Holy (Bleep), dude.

02:35.246 --> 02:37.630
"Judge Judy" ran for 18 seasons.

02:37.665 --> 02:39.749
Jesus Christ!

02:39.834 --> 02:41.751
Judge Judy's net worth is...

02:47.008 --> 02:48.307
... dollars.

02:48.343 --> 02:49.642
Wait, keep that face.

02:49.677 --> 02:52.728
I gotta take a pic and capture your deep,

02:52.814 --> 02:54.263
deep Judy discovery.

02:56.017 --> 02:57.316
Oh, so good.

02:57.352 --> 02:58.517
I'm gonna 'gram it.

02:58.569 --> 03:01.020
- No filter.
- All right, fine.

03:03.574 --> 03:04.824
Whoa...

03:13.620 --> 03:15.400
_

03:43.164 --> 03:44.313
What up, my queen?

03:48.486 --> 03:49.735
Ahh! Ahh!

03:49.821 --> 03:51.737
Jesus, I forgot you
were in the (Bleep) room!

03:51.789 --> 03:53.456
Holy (Bleep), dude, how did we forget

03:53.541 --> 03:54.990
that we were here together?

03:55.076 --> 03:56.459
What is wrong with us?

03:56.544 --> 03:57.793
I feel like I blacked out.

03:57.879 --> 04:00.246
We were so tapped into
the worldwide bloodstream,

04:00.331 --> 04:03.416
we fell into the lint roll matrix.

04:03.468 --> 04:05.051
What time is it?

04:07.255 --> 04:08.254
Oh god.

04:08.339 --> 04:11.140
All right, we need to go outside for real

04:11.225 --> 04:14.093
and live like normal people.

04:14.178 --> 04:17.012
Let's just get dressed
and go to the wedding.

04:17.098 --> 04:20.015
Dude, can you imagine if
we left our phones here?

04:20.101 --> 04:22.234
We would be totally off the grid.

04:22.270 --> 04:25.604
It would be like breathing
air for the first time.

04:25.690 --> 04:26.822
Right?

04:26.908 --> 04:29.325
It's like all we do is
wake up, sign in and...

04:30.661 --> 04:33.195
We are plugged into the matrix all day.

04:33.281 --> 04:36.499
Gmail, Grindr, Facebook,
Facetime, Insta, Grindr,

04:36.584 --> 04:37.500
Tumblr, Twitter, Dlisted.

04:37.585 --> 04:38.868
Jesus Christ!

04:38.953 --> 04:40.920
And then we have to rip
the plug out to go to sleep,

04:40.955 --> 04:42.755
rub one out, rinse and repeat.

04:42.790 --> 04:44.957
We have these auto-responses programmed...

04:46.010 --> 04:47.176
Hello?

04:47.261 --> 04:48.094
Hey, what up, Ilana?

04:48.129 --> 04:49.628
Hey, boy, what up?

04:49.680 --> 04:50.513
Do you know if your brother's wearing a tie

04:50.598 --> 04:51.597
to the wedding today?

04:51.632 --> 04:53.299
Dude, I'm not my brother's keeper.

04:53.384 --> 04:54.767
I'm just trying to gauge the dress code.

04:54.802 --> 04:56.135
I don't want to be overdressed,

04:56.220 --> 04:58.220
but I really don't want to be underdressed.

04:58.306 --> 04:59.805
You think a dog tie is too on the nose?

04:59.891 --> 05:00.890
No, it's perfect.

05:00.975 --> 05:02.975
You look great in themed clothing.

05:03.060 --> 05:03.976
Thank you.

05:04.061 --> 05:06.061
And... I'm not patronizing you,

05:06.147 --> 05:08.697
but did you remember the rings?

05:08.783 --> 05:10.483
Well, not to "patronize" you,

05:10.535 --> 05:12.485
but of course I have the rings.

05:12.570 --> 05:14.320
They're on Abbi's toes.

05:14.405 --> 05:15.321
See you there.

05:15.406 --> 05:16.572
- Top dog.
- Later.

05:21.496 --> 05:22.878
Welcome to another installment of

05:22.964 --> 05:24.413
"How To" with Dr. Whiz.

05:24.499 --> 05:25.965
Today I'm gonna show you how to tie

05:26.000 --> 05:27.049
a Windsor knot.

05:27.135 --> 05:28.050
Let's begin.

05:28.136 --> 05:29.502
Take the little guy

05:29.554 --> 05:30.970
and place him in front of your neck.

05:31.005 --> 05:32.171
Clap if you understand.

05:34.392 --> 05:37.009
Ab-dude, we should roll to the wedding.

05:37.094 --> 05:39.645
We'll take in more nature faster.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.597
Yes. These are Jaime's.

05:41.682 --> 05:43.015
We got these after hurricane Wanda

05:43.100 --> 05:44.266
for future emergencies.

05:44.352 --> 05:46.152
They'll obviously be huge, but...

05:46.187 --> 05:48.320
Yeah, I mean, we can maybe
stuff some newspaper in

05:48.356 --> 05:49.822
around my negative space
in my foot or something,

05:49.857 --> 05:51.357
or sponges, if we have.

05:51.442 --> 05:52.908
You know, you could wear a bunch of socks

05:52.994 --> 05:55.077
or cotton balls.

05:55.163 --> 05:56.529
They... they fit me.

05:56.581 --> 05:57.780
They're a little snug, actually.

05:57.865 --> 05:59.698
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.201
Uh, I knew that... I knew that they would.

06:02.286 --> 06:05.454
I was just being optimistic.

06:05.540 --> 06:07.373
No, that's cool, dude.

06:07.425 --> 06:09.091
That's cool.

06:09.177 --> 06:10.543
Yeah.

06:10.628 --> 06:11.544
That's cool.

06:34.702 --> 06:36.452
Man, this is great.

06:36.537 --> 06:37.820
I love breezes.

06:37.905 --> 06:40.322
Nature is seriously amazing.

06:41.375 --> 06:42.708
So where's this dog wedding?

06:42.743 --> 06:43.909
Oh my god.

06:43.995 --> 06:44.960
I don't know.

06:45.046 --> 06:46.328
We gotta go back and get our phones.

06:46.414 --> 06:48.747
No, you're not going back
to that life right now.

06:48.799 --> 06:49.632
Come on, we can do this.

06:49.717 --> 06:50.916
Yeah, you know what?

06:51.002 --> 06:54.336
If our foremothers can find
countries without phones,

06:54.422 --> 06:56.639
we can find a dang dog wedding.

06:56.724 --> 06:57.840
Exactly.

06:57.925 --> 06:59.341
We are addicted to the matrix, dude.

06:59.427 --> 07:01.427
Admitting it is the first
step in the road to recovery.

07:01.512 --> 07:03.512
I mean, all I'm thinking about
right now is my (Bleep) phone.

07:04.599 --> 07:05.931
I miss the blue light.

07:06.017 --> 07:07.933
Ooh, I wanna marry the blue light.

07:08.019 --> 07:09.768
But you know what? We need to be present.

07:09.854 --> 07:11.737
We can go a couple
hours without our phones.

07:11.772 --> 07:13.272
What are we, teenagers?

07:13.357 --> 07:15.157
Boys!

07:15.243 --> 07:16.659
Yum.

07:16.744 --> 07:19.962
Oh my god, look at their... bodies.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.081
If I had my phone right now,

07:22.133 --> 07:24.166
I would Tinder the (Bleep) out of like

07:24.252 --> 07:26.385
all those beefcakes.

07:26.421 --> 07:28.387
You don't need Tinder for these dudes.

07:28.423 --> 07:30.590
You've got Tinder right here, IRL.

07:31.476 --> 07:32.725
Wanna "fook"?!

07:33.895 --> 07:34.944
What? Ilana!

07:35.029 --> 07:37.697
Oh, it's not big, it's like wanna "fook"?

07:39.234 --> 07:40.533
I am not down for that.

07:40.568 --> 07:43.286
Oh my god, somebody's gonna love...

07:43.371 --> 07:44.537
Wanna "fook"?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.039
You are insane.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.574
We're in a park right now.

07:48.626 --> 07:49.792
Ab, try it.

07:49.878 --> 07:50.793
Live in the moment.

07:50.879 --> 07:52.128
You just said that to me.

07:52.213 --> 07:55.498
Our foremothers didn't pin
dudes on (Bleep) Tinder.

07:55.583 --> 07:57.416
They'd spray their pheromones all over

07:57.468 --> 07:59.051
and yell, "wanna 'fook'?"

07:59.087 --> 08:00.386
Come on.

08:00.421 --> 08:02.588
All right.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.590
Wanna "foooook"?

08:06.261 --> 08:07.510
Yes, dude, it worked.

08:12.150 --> 08:14.016
- I got it!
- Cute.

08:16.571 --> 08:18.354
Oh... Jesus.

08:19.774 --> 08:20.856
I'm good!

08:22.527 --> 08:25.778
Man, my first impression
is always better on Tinder.

08:25.863 --> 08:28.247
I suck without the Internet, dude.

08:28.283 --> 08:31.834
It's like I'm too real for it, you know?

08:31.920 --> 08:33.001
Being off the matrix is gonna make us

08:33.087 --> 08:34.837
plug in more consciously.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.205
Like that day we went off sugar.

08:36.291 --> 08:37.506
How much sweeter were
sour straws after that?

08:37.592 --> 08:38.506
So much sweeter.

08:38.592 --> 08:39.875
God, you're right.

08:39.961 --> 08:41.010
One day off the matrix is gonna make us

08:41.095 --> 08:42.211
so much stronger.

08:42.297 --> 08:43.179
Dude, I think we're going too fast.

08:43.264 --> 08:44.212
We're gonna have to bail.

08:44.299 --> 08:45.681
- What do you mean, bail?
- Bail!

08:45.767 --> 08:47.183
- Bail!
- What do you mean, bail?

08:47.268 --> 08:49.268
Oh (Bleep), I can't stop!

08:49.304 --> 08:51.854
Ilana! Abbi!

08:58.370 --> 09:00.836
Oh my god. Are you okay?

09:00.921 --> 09:02.504
My foot really hurts.

09:02.589 --> 09:05.056
- I think I sprained it.
- Oh my god, dude.

09:05.142 --> 09:08.093
Jaime's blades were too big
for your bony, dainty feet.

09:08.178 --> 09:09.344
Yeah, that was it.

09:09.396 --> 09:11.513
My feet were probably too small for them.

09:11.598 --> 09:14.433
That's what... that's what did it.

09:14.518 --> 09:15.851
Ilana, this is really deep.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.319
I don't think I can climb out.

09:17.354 --> 09:19.187
And we don't even have our phones.

09:19.239 --> 09:20.689
We can't even call for help!

09:20.774 --> 09:22.157
What if I jump down in there,

09:22.192 --> 09:23.692
and then we scream for help together?

09:23.744 --> 09:25.360
No, you need to go get help.

09:25.412 --> 09:26.695
Are you kidding?

09:26.780 --> 09:27.996
God, I wish we had our
phones so we could Facetime

09:28.031 --> 09:29.030
while I go get help.

09:30.367 --> 09:31.867
Ilana, what?

09:31.919 --> 09:33.869
Okay, we got this.

09:33.954 --> 09:35.587
NBD, sister.

09:35.672 --> 09:38.507
I need you to smoke two joints
for the pain, immediately.

09:38.542 --> 09:40.792
We got nuts and figs for sustenance,

09:40.878 --> 09:42.511
and lanyard for entertainment.

09:42.546 --> 09:44.346
You mean gimp?

09:44.381 --> 09:45.680
You wanna argue about
what it's called right now?

09:45.716 --> 09:46.681
You, in the hole?

09:46.717 --> 09:48.216
No.

09:48.268 --> 09:50.552
Okay, I'm gonna BRB.

09:50.604 --> 09:52.103
I'm going to find Eliot and Lincoln stat.

09:52.189 --> 09:53.054
We're going to get you out of the hole.

09:53.140 --> 09:54.473
I don't want these figs.

09:54.558 --> 09:56.191
I don't like the little beads in 'em.

09:58.061 --> 09:59.778
Why is there a hole here?

09:59.863 --> 10:00.946
Jeez!

10:01.031 --> 10:01.980
Okay, I'll be right back.

10:02.065 --> 10:03.114
Be good.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.199
Wait, Ilana.

10:07.454 --> 10:08.737
Yeah?

10:08.789 --> 10:09.988
I do want the figs.

10:10.791 --> 10:11.740
Good choice.

10:25.672 --> 10:27.422
Hey, d... d... d... do not touch that!

10:27.508 --> 10:28.673
Those are the dog quiche!

10:28.759 --> 10:31.643
I'm sorry I snapped, I'm very sorry.

10:31.728 --> 10:34.312
Somebody switched the dog quiche

10:34.398 --> 10:35.347
with the human quiche.

10:35.432 --> 10:36.398
It's okay, man.

10:36.433 --> 10:37.599
We'll just switch 'em back.

10:38.819 --> 10:39.985
I just checked in with the bride.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.737
Her heart is racing,
but that's not unusual.

10:42.773 --> 10:44.356
Chihuahuas' hearts always race.

10:44.441 --> 10:46.908
They were bred as like a joke.

10:46.944 --> 10:49.494
She may just have a case of cold paws.

10:50.747 --> 10:52.447
Cold paws is a very serious disease

10:52.499 --> 10:53.832
in the chihuahua community.

10:53.917 --> 10:55.250
Poor toe circulation.

10:55.285 --> 10:57.252
It's the number-one killer of chihuahuas.

10:59.957 --> 11:01.957
Cold paws, cold feet, you get why I...

11:02.042 --> 11:04.292
This wedding is a disaster.

11:04.378 --> 11:06.761
I'm sweating my (Bleep) nuts off.

11:06.797 --> 11:09.264
I need you to block me from Brandon

11:09.299 --> 11:10.799
so that he doesn't see
my enormous sweat glands.

11:10.851 --> 11:12.884
Eliot, relax, man.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.603
This is a beautiful setup you got here.

11:14.638 --> 11:16.187
I've never been to a dog wedding before,

11:16.273 --> 11:18.306
but I'd get married here in a second.

11:18.358 --> 11:19.858
Hey, don't tell Ilana I said that.

11:19.943 --> 11:21.393
- I'm just running my mouth.
- That's right.

11:21.478 --> 11:22.894
Ilana.

11:22.980 --> 11:23.945
She has the rings.

11:23.981 --> 11:25.363
Where is my sister?

11:25.449 --> 11:27.816
So now Abbi's stuck and I
need to get to the wedding.

11:27.901 --> 11:29.818
- Where's the wedding?
- Near the lake.

11:29.903 --> 11:30.869
Well, the lake is huge. What part?

11:30.954 --> 11:33.622
Oh my god, forget it!

11:35.492 --> 11:36.491
Hey, you asked me!

11:37.544 --> 11:39.995
Ow... oh...

11:40.080 --> 11:41.580
Okay.

11:41.665 --> 11:43.882
Pain is in the brain.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.634
Ow! Pain is in the brain.

11:45.719 --> 11:47.252
Pain is in my stupid, stupid brain.

11:51.508 --> 11:53.258
I'm down the shore with my family.

11:55.763 --> 11:57.095
Yeah.

11:57.147 --> 11:59.648
We're at the beach and it's fine.

11:59.733 --> 12:00.982
No, (Bleep) that.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.517
(Bleep) that!

12:02.603 --> 12:05.904
I am at dinner with Elijah Wood.

12:05.939 --> 12:08.940
And people are saying that
we're so cute together.

12:10.277 --> 12:12.277
And all we get is dessert.

12:12.363 --> 12:14.279
No, (Bleep) that.

12:14.331 --> 12:18.617
I am at an extravagant flea market

12:18.702 --> 12:21.036
with Mark Ruffalo.

12:21.121 --> 12:22.087
Yes!

12:23.457 --> 12:27.125
All we want is some wooden milk crates

12:27.211 --> 12:31.847
to line our office/maybe nursery one day.

12:31.932 --> 12:34.049
But we don't
say that to everybody.

12:34.134 --> 12:35.133
No!

12:35.219 --> 12:37.352
I am in Turks and Caicos right now...

12:38.439 --> 12:39.388
... with Taye Diggs.

12:41.058 --> 12:43.608
There's no pain when you're
getting your groove back.

12:46.313 --> 12:48.480
Okay, I can do this.

12:48.565 --> 12:50.449
I have nature skills.

13:08.051 --> 13:11.336
Eliot!

13:13.006 --> 13:15.507
Eliot?

13:54.598 --> 13:56.097
Wait.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.016
What am I doing?

13:58.051 --> 13:59.684
Eliot!

13:59.720 --> 14:00.685
Eliot!

14:00.721 --> 14:01.153
El!

14:06.600 --> 14:08.410
_

14:10.563 --> 14:11.562
Whoa.

14:17.069 --> 14:18.735
What is this?

14:22.208 --> 14:24.291
Oh, Jesus, turn it off.

14:35.054 --> 14:37.054
What the (Bleep)?

14:50.819 --> 14:52.519
Come on, what's happening?

14:52.605 --> 14:53.654
Come on.

14:53.739 --> 14:55.022
All right.

14:55.107 --> 14:56.356
Okay.

15:08.420 --> 15:10.003
Poppi, look.

15:10.089 --> 15:11.838
Okay, one more. Ready?

15:11.924 --> 15:13.290
And then boom.

15:13.375 --> 15:14.841
Look, I don't want to freak out right now,

15:14.927 --> 15:17.794
but that bitch, she
won't keep her dress on.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.630
It's a Vera Wag.

15:19.715 --> 15:20.764
God, I'm sweating like a beast.

15:20.799 --> 15:22.349
- I hate myself.
- Whoa, whoa.

15:22.434 --> 15:25.352
Everyone... specifically
you... needs to relax.

15:25.437 --> 15:28.812
This is a special moment for your... son?

15:28.824 --> 15:30.357
Grandson.

15:30.443 --> 15:32.276
Your grandson is getting married today.

15:32.328 --> 15:33.610
Get yourself together, man.

15:33.662 --> 15:34.661
I'm trying, I just...

15:34.747 --> 15:36.747
I don't want Brandon to see me like this.

15:36.782 --> 15:37.915
Sweaty.

15:37.950 --> 15:39.700
Oh...

15:39.785 --> 15:40.784
You like Brandon.

15:40.870 --> 15:41.952
- Yeah.
- Okay, I got this.

15:42.004 --> 15:43.170
Take a few deep breaths,

15:43.255 --> 15:46.206
and then you dab your t-zone, lightly.

15:48.844 --> 15:49.843
I think we should get started

15:49.929 --> 15:51.545
before Poppi changes her mind again.

15:51.630 --> 15:53.964
Okay, but, Monica, we
don't have the rings yet.

15:54.050 --> 15:57.017
Ordinarily, I would not
say this, but they're dogs.

15:57.103 --> 15:59.136
Well, you just lost one star on dog Yelp.

15:59.221 --> 16:00.220
No.

16:02.224 --> 16:05.841
Hey, can you get the dress
back on the dog, please?

16:06.729 --> 16:07.644
I'll talk to her.

16:08.681 --> 16:10.931
Okay, Poppi, what are you doing here?

16:11.017 --> 16:12.233
How many times are we gonna do this?

16:12.318 --> 16:13.517
I like Eliot,

16:13.569 --> 16:14.602
but if you're not into Atticus,

16:14.687 --> 16:16.020
I need you to tell me now 'cause

16:16.072 --> 16:17.021
I can't afford more alimony.

16:19.242 --> 16:20.491
El?

16:20.526 --> 16:21.826
Eliot?!

16:23.362 --> 16:24.528
Yes!

16:28.201 --> 16:30.034
Oh, dog wedding gazebo!

16:30.119 --> 16:32.453
Yes! Maps rule!

16:32.538 --> 16:34.038
Foremother's a bitch!

16:34.090 --> 16:35.206
Sacagawea!

16:42.098 --> 16:43.180
Come on.

16:46.219 --> 16:47.468
Hello?

16:47.553 --> 16:48.803
Hello!

16:48.888 --> 16:50.805
Oh my god, thank you so much.

16:51.306 --> 16:55.060
_

16:55.061 --> 16:57.740
- _
- _

16:57.750 --> 16:59.897
- What?
- No English.

16:59.982 --> 17:01.031
Sorry.

17:01.067 --> 17:02.566
Uh, auffen...

17:02.618 --> 17:04.819
Are you gonna call?

17:04.904 --> 17:07.570
Oh, you're taking a photo of me.

17:07.656 --> 17:08.739
Yeah... no, no.

17:08.825 --> 17:10.074
No!

17:18.584 --> 17:20.584
Sir...

17:20.636 --> 17:22.553
I'm afraid we're never
gonna get out of this place.

17:27.593 --> 17:30.227
I think we can
all agree it's clear.

17:30.263 --> 17:32.763
There's a lot of love here,

17:32.849 --> 17:35.316
and it was communicated
to me before this ceremony

17:35.325 --> 17:39.280
how important trust is
in this relationship.

17:39.281 --> 17:41.570
Atticus and Poppi's* dads

17:41.574 --> 17:43.607
taught love from a very young age.

17:43.693 --> 17:46.577
And now, without the rings,

17:46.612 --> 17:49.246
do you, Poppi, take Atticus

17:49.282 --> 17:51.365
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

17:51.450 --> 17:53.284
She does.

17:53.336 --> 17:55.452
And do you, Atticus,

17:55.538 --> 17:57.955
take Poppi to be your lawfully wedded wife?

17:58.624 --> 18:00.291
Wonderful.

18:00.376 --> 18:04.178
If anyone here objects to this
union, speak now or foreve...

18:04.263 --> 18:05.129
Wait!

18:05.214 --> 18:06.380
Hold up!

18:06.465 --> 18:09.300
Stop the wedding, stop the wedding!

18:09.385 --> 18:11.018
She's always gotta make it about her.

18:12.605 --> 18:15.272
This was once Abbi's shirt that
I re-purposed to make cooler.

18:15.308 --> 18:16.607
Come on, boy, that's her scent.

18:16.642 --> 18:18.642
- She's a girl.
- Oh.

18:18.728 --> 18:20.110
We'll treat her differently, then.

18:20.146 --> 18:23.397
Oh god, this was the worst
day to go off the grid.

18:23.582 --> 18:27.952
Brazil nut, I gotta say
your pitch is fantastic.

18:27.987 --> 18:29.737
You have some star quality.

18:29.822 --> 18:31.121
I can't speak for the other judges

18:31.157 --> 18:33.324
but we'll see what they to say, okay?

18:36.329 --> 18:39.663
No, I completely disagree.

18:39.715 --> 18:40.748
Are you kidding me?

18:40.833 --> 18:42.049
She put her heart out there.

18:42.134 --> 18:43.300
She put her soul out there.

18:43.336 --> 18:45.169
You are complete overlooking

18:45.254 --> 18:48.672
the level of commitment
that performance took!

18:48.724 --> 18:50.341
Abbi!

18:50.426 --> 18:51.842
Abbi!

18:51.928 --> 18:55.312
I'm pretty sure she's this way,
but let's split up to be sure.

18:55.398 --> 18:56.931
Okay, meet back, meet back.

18:58.517 --> 19:00.317
Abbi!

19:01.604 --> 19:03.570
Congratulations, spool stick.

19:03.656 --> 19:05.739
You're going to Hollywood, my friend.

19:09.195 --> 19:10.494
Yeah, it's her!

19:10.529 --> 19:11.779
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

19:11.864 --> 19:14.615
Abbi's wearing my backpack as a diaper.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.583
Dude, I was gone for like 25 minutes.

19:16.669 --> 19:18.369
Half-hour tops.

19:18.421 --> 19:20.704
It felt like a lot longer.

19:20.756 --> 19:22.122
Abbi, that foot is jacked-up.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.674
You should put some ice on it.

19:23.709 --> 19:24.708
I know.

19:24.760 --> 19:25.793
I'm practically a doctor.

19:25.878 --> 19:27.094
But you're not.

19:27.179 --> 19:28.512
I am a doctor, and I
have a lot of experience

19:28.547 --> 19:29.680
with sprains and breaks.

19:29.715 --> 19:32.132
No offense, but it's more like

19:32.218 --> 19:34.134
you drain fluid from their butt sacks.

19:34.220 --> 19:36.887
Uh, none taken, but I work several species.

19:36.973 --> 19:38.555
None of which are human.

19:38.607 --> 19:40.391
Look, the truth about cats and dogs is...

19:40.476 --> 19:41.976
So is the ambulance coming soon?

19:42.061 --> 19:43.682
Yep, it's on its way.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.260
Oh, wow, there they are.

19:45.611 --> 19:47.478
- Oh, those are beautiful.
- You know what?

19:47.563 --> 19:49.363
We'll get them when the swelling goes down.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.148
Which I'm sure will be very soon.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.149
- 48 hours.
- In about one to two weeks.

19:56.584 --> 19:58.590
And now, without further ado,

19:58.619 --> 20:01.458
by the powers vested in me
by the state of New York,

20:01.477 --> 20:05.585
I now pronounce you, dog
husband, and dog wife.

20:06.418 --> 20:08.888
Ok, kiss.

20:10.081 --> 20:11.992
Yay!

20:18.059 --> 20:19.999
So I guess, we're related now.

20:20.008 --> 20:22.052
- Hm-mmm.
- Can in-laws hook up?

20:22.052 --> 20:26.198
- Yeah, it's like soft incest.
- Whoa, that's so royal.

20:26.870 --> 20:29.311
I think I've seen all
I needed to see today.

20:29.431 --> 20:31.753
Take her outta here, boys.

20:46.664 --> 20:51.806
Fig!
