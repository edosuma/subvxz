[phone chimes]

13:59.964 --> 14:03.300
So, it's been a year now, which...

14:03.759 --> 14:05.344
feels kind of crazy. [chuckles]

14:05.845 --> 14:06.887
And...

14:06.971 --> 14:09.932
I mean, it's not that
I don't think about stealing...

14:10.766 --> 14:11.725
I just...

14:12.017 --> 14:13.936

14:14.019 --> 14:16.105
you know, there are ways to cope.

Thank you.

Um...

I'm Tabitha.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.714
[all] Hi, Tabitha.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.302
And I'm a shoplifter.

14:48.637 --> 14:52.224
Yesterday I lifted something,
and I guess I feel...

14:52.933 --> 14:54.018
kind of shitty.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.105
Stealing used to feel like...

14:59.273 --> 15:01.483
getting gifts on Christmas or something.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.907
But once you find out Santa's not real,
it's kind of hard to pretend that he is.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.535
I mean, I guess I'm just...

15:14.872 --> 15:18.042
I guess I'm just tired of pretending that
things are perfect when they're not.

15:20.502 --> 15:23.005
It feels like everyone expects me
to be a certain way.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.636
But what if I stopped?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.477
It's depressing enough
we have to be here...

15:36.936 --> 15:39.897
You'd think they'd not
put out the same shitty snacks.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.190
Hey.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.609
[Moe] Yo, you all right?

15:44.860 --> 15:46.946
Yeah, I guess I'm just...

15:48.530 --> 15:50.741

15:50.824 --> 15:52.284
Not just that, it's...

15:52.743 --> 15:54.536
my entire family is fucked.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.830
And I feel like I'm just now starting
to realize that.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.707
-Better late than never.
-Yeah.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.336
I mean, I know I'm supposed to be mad at
my dad for cheating and everything, but...

16:02.795 --> 16:04.755
I just look at my mom
and I want to scream,

16:04.838 --> 16:06.840
"Wake up. What's wrong with you?"

16:10.552 --> 16:11.595

16:14.682 --> 16:16.266

16:16.350 --> 16:17.393
It's fine.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.397
Girls hate their moms. You don't have
to break some age-old tradition

16:21.480 --> 16:22.606

16:36.203 --> 16:37.079
Hey.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.039
Hey.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.250
Um, look, I'm...

You must really miss her.

17:08.485 --> 17:09.695
She's beautiful.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.743
How'd she pass?

17:18.078 --> 17:19.872
Um, a car accident.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.374
We were hit by a drunk driver.

It doesn't make...

It's...

17:37.139 --> 17:38.098

Now I have to...

17:41.351 --> 17:44.813

And I just...

I can't relive it.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.405
I'm so sorry.

17:54.698 --> 17:55.866
You don't have to be sorry.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.872
I haven't driven since the accident.

18:02.956 --> 18:03.999

18:04.750 --> 18:07.419
behind the wheel when it happened.

Driving the other day...

18:11.715 --> 18:12.883
really freaked me out.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.471

I'm sorry that I put you
in that situation.

I haven't...

20:09.291 --> 20:10.209
yet.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.585
I'm really offended.

Good, 'cause I really need a groupie.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.468
I'm sure you have a million.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.386
You can never have too many.

20:24.806 --> 20:27.768
What are my duties as groupie?

20:27.851 --> 20:29.436
-Just so I know.
-Oh, it's easy.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.521
You just go everywhere I go,

20:31.605 --> 20:34.608
and do everything I say to do.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.571
You can even make it to head groupie
if you play your cards right.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.824
I think I can manage that.

when you wear the pin.
