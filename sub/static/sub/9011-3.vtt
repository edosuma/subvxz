it the bone train.

Would you like to ride
the bone train, Miss?

15:30.972 --> 15:32.514

15:32.599 --> 15:34.099
How about you, Morty?

Would you like to
ride the bone train?

15:37.145 --> 15:38.353
Why are you doing this bit?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.063
We're gonna die! Let's go!

15:42.150 --> 15:45.068
Well... I can see you're busy.

here and operate it manually.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.920
I-It was a dick move for me
to even pause like that.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.047
This is all my fault.

I'm almost there, Morty!

Reports from all over the
country have been coming in

16:45.963 --> 16:48.256
about what appears
to be a giant,

creating a new Anatomy Park.

Dr. Bloom's work.
