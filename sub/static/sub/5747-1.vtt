Congratulations.

Well...

05:52.763 --> 05:55.015
I guess we really did it, huh?

05:56.475 --> 05:59.186
You and Betty have been inseparable...

05:59.394 --> 06:01.480
since you met in Dr. Scott's courses.

06:01.730 --> 06:06.485
Tell you the truth, Brad, that was
the only reason I came in the first place.

06:07.694 --> 06:10.781
- I mean...
- Okay, guys, this is it! You ready?

06:10.989 --> 06:13.784
Look, Betty's gonna throw her bouquet.

06:18.664 --> 06:19.998
I got it!

- I got it!
- Hey, big fella.

06:22.626 --> 06:25.170
Looks like it could be your turn next.

06:25.420 --> 06:26.922
Who knows.

06:27.172 --> 06:29.216
So long. See you, Brad.

06:32.719 --> 06:34.429
Come on, hop in.

06:38.642 --> 06:40.560
See you, Brad.

06:53.865 --> 06:57.619
Brad, wasn't it wonderful?
Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful?

06:57.869 --> 07:00.831
Just an hour ago she was
plain old Betty Munroe.

07:01.081 --> 07:05.502
And now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt.

07:08.088 --> 07:11.341
- Yes, Janet. Ralph's a lucky guy.
- Yes.

07:12.050 --> 07:15.095
Oh, I always cry at weddings.

07:16.722 --> 07:19.725
Everyone knows Betty's
a wonderful little cook.

07:19.975 --> 07:21.351
Yes.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.484
Ralph will be in line
for promotion in a year.

07:29.693 --> 07:30.944
Yes.

07:34.156 --> 07:36.158
- Hey, Janet.
- Yes, Brad?

07:38.410 --> 07:40.329
I've got something to say.

07:42.914 --> 07:44.708
<i>I really loved</i>

<i>You beat the other girls</i>

<i>To the bride's bouquet</i>

07:57.011 --> 07:58.946
Oh, Brad.

08:01.892 --> 08:04.936
- <i>The river was deep but I swam it</i>
- <i>Janet</i>

08:05.145 --> 08:07.773
- <i>The future is ours, so let's plan it</i>
- <i>Janet</i>

08:08.023 --> 08:10.901
- <i>So please don't tell me to can it</i>
- <i>Janet</i>

08:11.151 --> 08:14.529
<i>I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, Janet</i>

08:14.780 --> 08:16.615
<i>I love you</i>

08:18.283 --> 08:20.869
- <i>The road was long but I ran it</i>
- <i>Janet</i>

08:21.078 --> 08:24.581
- <i>A fire's in my heart and you fan it</i>
- <i>Janet</i>

08:24.790 --> 08:27.292
- <i>There's one fool for you and I am it</i>
- <i>Janet</i>

08:27.542 --> 08:30.629
<i>I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, Janet</i>

08:30.879 --> 08:32.381
<i>I love you</i>

08:34.841 --> 08:36.842
<i>Here's a ring to prove</i>

08:37.052 --> 08:38.929
<i>That I'm no joker</i>

08:40.889 --> 08:42.057
<i>There's three ways</i>

08:42.265 --> 08:45.811
<i>That love can grow</i>

08:47.104 --> 08:48.939
<i>That's good, bad</i>

08:49.147 --> 08:52.067
<i>Or mediocre</i>

08:52.859 --> 08:55.112
<i>Oh, J-A-N-E-T</i>

08:55.362 --> 08:57.698
<i>I love you so</i>

08:59.032 --> 09:02.536
- <i>Oh, it's nicer than Betty Munroe had</i>
- <i>Oh, Brad</i>

09:02.744 --> 09:06.081
- <i>Now we're engaged and I'm so glad</i>
- <i>Oh, Brad</i>

09:06.290 --> 09:08.875
- <i>That you met Mom and you know Dad</i>
- <i>Oh, Brad</i>

09:09.126 --> 09:12.087
<i>I've one thing to say and that's
Brad, I'm mad</i>

09:12.337 --> 09:14.381
<i>For you too</i>

09:16.967 --> 09:19.177
<i>Oh, Brad</i>

09:19.636 --> 09:22.097
<i>Oh, damn it</i>

09:22.389 --> 09:25.017
<i>I'm mad</i>

09:25.726 --> 09:28.562
<i>Oh, Janet</i>

09:28.770 --> 09:30.856
<i>For you</i>

09:31.064 --> 09:33.775
<i>I love you too</i>

09:34.860 --> 09:39.698
<i>There's one thing left to do
Ah-ooh</i>

09:40.741 --> 09:43.619
- <i>And that's go see the man who began it</i>
- <i>Janet</i>

09:43.869 --> 09:46.913
- <i>When we met in his science, exam it</i>
- <i>Janet</i>

09:47.164 --> 09:50.042
- <i>Made me give you the eye, then panic</i>
- <i>Janet</i>

09:50.250 --> 09:53.587
<i>Now I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, Janet</i>

09:53.837 --> 09:57.382
<i>I love you</i>

09:57.633 --> 10:00.510
<i>Damn it, Janet</i>

10:00.761 --> 10:03.639
<i>Oh, Brad, I'm mad</i>

10:03.889 --> 10:06.516
<i>Damn it, Janet</i>

10:06.725 --> 10:11.730
<i>I love you</i>

10:28.705 --> 10:32.501
I would like, if I may...

10:32.751 --> 10:37.589
to take you on a strange journey.

10:50.394 --> 10:53.480
It seemed a fairly ordinary night...

10:53.730 --> 10:58.402
when Brad Majors and
his fiancée, Janet Weiss...

10:58.652 --> 11:01.613
two young, ordinary, healthy kids...

11:01.822 --> 11:05.534
left Denton that
late November evening...

11:05.784 --> 11:09.538
to visit a Dr. Everett Scott...

11:09.788 --> 11:13.166
ex-tutor and now friend to both of them.

11:15.794 --> 11:20.382
It's true there were
dark storm clouds...

11:20.632 --> 11:24.094
heavy, black and pendulous...

11:24.344 --> 11:26.805
toward which they were driving.

11:27.180 --> 11:30.183
It's true also that the spare tire
they carried...

11:30.434 --> 11:32.477
was badly in need of some air.

11:32.686 --> 11:36.231
But they, being normal kids and...

11:36.481 --> 11:37.983
on a night out...

11:38.233 --> 11:42.863
they were not going to let a storm
spoil the events of their evening.

11:44.740 --> 11:47.034
On a night out.

11:48.910 --> 11:50.621
It was a night out...

11:50.871 --> 11:52.914
they were going to remember...

11:53.165 --> 11:56.418
for a very long time.

12:05.177 --> 12:08.305
<i>I have never been a quitter.</i>

12:09.097 --> 12:13.226
<i>To leave office before my term
is completed is abhorrent...</i>

12:13.477 --> 12:15.604
<i>to every instinct in my body.</i>

12:16.897 --> 12:18.523
<i>But as president...</i>

12:18.774 --> 12:22.903
<i>I must put the interests
of America first.</i>

12:24.237 --> 12:28.033
<i>America needs a full-time president...</i>

12:28.283 --> 12:30.827
<i>and a full-time Congress...</i>

12:31.203 --> 12:33.287
<i>particularly at this time...</i>

12:34.665 --> 12:37.542
Gosh, that's the third motorcyclist
that's passed us.

12:37.793 --> 12:41.088
They sure do take their lives
in their hands.

12:41.338 --> 12:44.967
Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap
to that type.

12:51.848 --> 12:53.767
What's the matter, Brad, darling?

12:55.936 --> 12:58.146
We took the wrong fork a few miles back.

12:58.355 --> 12:59.189
Oh.

12:59.398 --> 13:01.650
Where did that motorcyclist come from?

13:03.652 --> 13:05.946
I guess we'll just have to turn back.

13:11.368 --> 13:12.369
What was that bang?

13:12.828 --> 13:14.413
We must have a blowout.

13:15.330 --> 13:18.959
Damn it! I knew I should've gotten
that spare tire fixed.

13:20.252 --> 13:22.129
You stay here and I'll go for help.

13:22.379 --> 13:24.548
We're in the middle of nowhere.

13:29.428 --> 13:32.014
Didn't we pass a castle
a few miles back?

13:34.057 --> 13:36.518
Maybe they have a telephone I could use.

13:36.893 --> 13:37.811
I'm going too.

13:38.270 --> 13:42.983
- Both of us don't need to get wet.
- I'm coming with you.

13:45.152 --> 13:48.614
Besides, the owner of that phone
might be a beautiful woman...

13:48.864 --> 13:51.116
and you might never come back again.

14:34.076 --> 14:36.828
<i>In the velvet darkness</i>

14:37.079 --> 14:39.331
<i>Of the blackest night</i>

14:39.581 --> 14:42.417
<i>Burning bright</i>

14:43.335 --> 14:46.797
<i>There's a guiding star</i>

14:49.466 --> 14:52.469
<i>No matter what</i>

14:52.719 --> 14:54.721
<i>Or...</i>

14:55.764 --> 14:58.684
<i>who you are</i>

15:01.269 --> 15:04.314
<i>There's a light</i>

15:05.607 --> 15:09.653
<i>Over at the Frankenstein place</i>

15:09.903 --> 15:12.823
<i>There's a light</i>

15:16.702 --> 15:20.372
<i>Burning in the fireplace</i>

15:20.998 --> 15:26.128
<i>There's a light, light</i>

15:26.420 --> 15:30.090
<i>In the darkness</i>

15:30.340 --> 15:35.178
<i>Of everybody's life</i>

15:44.730 --> 15:49.151
<i>The darkness must go</i>

15:49.401 --> 15:52.070
<i>Down the river</i>

15:52.279 --> 15:56.033
<i>Of nights dreaming</i>

15:57.200 --> 16:00.454
<i>Flow morphia slow</i>

16:00.704 --> 16:02.956
<i>Let the sun</i>

16:03.206 --> 16:06.084
<i>And light come streaming</i>

16:06.335 --> 16:09.588
<i>Into my life</i>

16:12.090 --> 16:15.844
<i>Into my life</i>

16:20.265 --> 16:23.769
<i>There's a light</i>

16:24.936 --> 16:28.398
<i>Over at the Frankenstein place</i>

16:28.649 --> 16:31.902
<i>There's a light</i>

16:35.489 --> 16:39.409
<i>Burning in the fireplace</i>

16:39.826 --> 16:42.496
<i>There's a light</i>

16:42.996 --> 16:45.248
<i>Light</i>

16:45.874 --> 16:49.670
<i>In the darkness</i>

16:49.920 --> 16:55.050
<i>Of everybody's life</i>

17:01.890 --> 17:03.475
And so...

17:04.101 --> 17:08.438
it seemed that fortune
had smiled on Brad and Janet...

17:08.689 --> 17:13.193
and they had found the assistance
that their plight required.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.695
Or had they?

17:18.406 --> 17:21.117
Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold and I'm frightened.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.829
Just a moment, Janet.
They may have a phone.

17:43.307 --> 17:44.683
Hello.

17:46.435 --> 17:49.688
Hi! My name's Brad Majors.

17:50.397 --> 17:53.358
This is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.

17:53.900 --> 17:57.863
I wondered if you might help us.
Our car broke down up the road.

17:58.113 --> 17:59.948
Do you have a phone we might use?

18:01.325 --> 18:03.076
You're wet.

18:04.995 --> 18:07.831
Yes, it's raining.

18:08.874 --> 18:09.916
Yes.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.628
Oh.

18:17.257 --> 18:21.595
I think, perhaps,
you better both come inside.

18:25.432 --> 18:27.225
You're too kind.

18:42.658 --> 18:45.160
I'm frightened.
What kind of place is this?

18:45.410 --> 18:49.539
It's probably some kind of
hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

18:55.128 --> 18:56.421
This way.

19:01.426 --> 19:03.929
Are you having a party?

19:05.764 --> 19:08.558
You've arrived on
a rather special night.

19:08.809 --> 19:12.312
- It's one of the master's affairs.
- Oh.

19:12.562 --> 19:14.398
- Lucky him.
- You're lucky.

19:14.648 --> 19:19.569
He's lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky!

19:33.542 --> 19:35.877
<i>It's astounding</i>

19:36.128 --> 19:38.755
<i>Time is fleeting</i>

19:39.631 --> 19:42.801
<i>Madness takes its toll</i>

19:44.845 --> 19:46.680
<i>But listen closely</i>

19:46.888 --> 19:50.017
<i>Not for very much longer</i>

19:50.726 --> 19:55.022
<i>I've got to keep control</i>

19:55.522 --> 19:57.941
<i>I remember</i>

19:58.191 --> 20:00.861
<i>Doing the time warp</i>

20:01.570 --> 20:02.946
<i>Drinking</i>

20:03.196 --> 20:05.699
<i>Those moments when</i>

20:05.949 --> 20:08.368
<i>The blackness would hit me</i>

20:08.577 --> 20:11.288
<i>And the void would be calling</i>

20:13.457 --> 20:16.251
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

20:17.878 --> 20:21.173
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

20:24.217 --> 20:26.595
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

20:28.513 --> 20:32.267
- <i>And a step to the right</i>
- <i>With your hands on your hips</i>

20:33.769 --> 20:36.229
<i>You bring your knees in tight</i>

20:36.480 --> 20:38.815
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

20:39.066 --> 20:41.735
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

20:42.861 --> 20:47.157
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

20:48.450 --> 20:52.454
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

20:53.080 --> 20:55.123
<i>It's so dreamy</i>

20:55.374 --> 20:58.418
<i>Oh, fantasy free me</i>

20:58.627 --> 21:00.420
<i>So you can't see me</i>

21:01.213 --> 21:03.131
<i>No, not at all</i>

21:03.590 --> 21:05.968
<i>In another dimension</i>

21:06.218 --> 21:08.845
<i>With voyeuristic intention</i>

21:09.096 --> 21:11.765
<i>Well secluded</i>

21:12.182 --> 21:14.017
<i>I see all</i>

21:14.267 --> 21:16.645
<i>With a bit of a mind flip</i>

21:16.937 --> 21:19.690
<i>You're into the time slip</i>

21:20.190 --> 21:24.486
<i>And nothing can ever be the same</i>

21:24.736 --> 21:27.322
<i>You're spaced out on sensation</i>

21:27.531 --> 21:30.534
<i>Like you're under sedation</i>

21:31.326 --> 21:35.330
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

21:36.456 --> 21:40.752
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

21:41.545 --> 21:44.089
<i>I was walking down the street
Just having a think</i>

21:44.298 --> 21:46.967
<i>When a snake of a guy
Gave me an evil wink</i>

21:47.175 --> 21:49.303
<i>He shook a me up
He took me by surprise</i>

21:49.553 --> 21:52.389
<i>He had a pickup truck
And the devil's eyes</i>

21:52.597 --> 21:54.975
<i>He stared at me
And I felt a change</i>

21:55.225 --> 21:57.394
<i>Time meant nothing
Never would again</i>

21:57.811 --> 22:01.940
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

22:03.317 --> 22:07.362
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

22:07.613 --> 22:09.156
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

22:11.074 --> 22:14.911
- <i>And then a step to the right</i>
- <i>With your hands on your hips</i>

22:16.496 --> 22:18.915
<i>You bring your knees in tight</i>

22:19.166 --> 22:21.668
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

22:21.877 --> 22:24.546
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

22:25.631 --> 22:29.343
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

22:31.094 --> 22:35.390
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

22:53.742 --> 22:57.829
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

22:59.122 --> 23:03.293
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

23:03.543 --> 23:04.836
<i>It's just a jump to the left</i>

23:07.005 --> 23:10.634
- <i>And then a step to the right</i>
- <i>With your hands on your hips</i>

23:12.386 --> 23:14.179
<i>Bring your knees in tight</i>

23:14.721 --> 23:16.848
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

23:17.516 --> 23:19.935
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

23:21.311 --> 23:25.440
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

23:26.692 --> 23:30.946
<i>Let's do the time warp again</i>

23:43.166 --> 23:44.626
Say something.

23:45.752 --> 23:49.881
Say! Do any of you guys know
how to Madison?

23:54.261 --> 23:59.057
- Brad, please, let's get out of here.
- Keep a grip on yourself, Janet.

23:59.266 --> 24:02.769
- But it seems so unhealthy here.
- It's just a party, Janet.

24:03.020 --> 24:06.732
- Well, I want to go.
- We can't till I get to a phone.

24:06.982 --> 24:09.610
- Then ask the butler or someone.
- Just a moment.

24:09.818 --> 24:12.154
We don't want to interfere
with their celebrations.

24:12.362 --> 24:14.448
This isn't the Chamber of Commerce.

24:14.656 --> 24:17.409
They're probably foreigners
with different ways.

24:17.659 --> 24:20.370
They may do some more folk dancing.

24:22.581 --> 24:25.000
I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.

24:25.208 --> 24:28.211
I'm here, there's nothing
to worry about.

24:33.091 --> 24:35.093
<i>How do you do</i>

24:35.344 --> 24:37.429
<i>I see you've met</i>

24:37.679 --> 24:40.682
<i>My faithful handyman</i>

24:41.016 --> 24:43.268
<i>He's just a little brought down</i>

24:43.518 --> 24:46.563
<i>Because when you knocked</i>

24:46.813 --> 24:49.691
<i>He thought you were the candyman</i>

24:51.318 --> 24:53.278
<i>Don't get strung out</i>

24:53.528 --> 24:55.530
<i>By the way I look</i>

24:55.781 --> 24:59.201
<i>Don't judge a book by its cover</i>

24:59.451 --> 25:01.703
<i>I'm not much of a man</i>

25:01.954 --> 25:03.705
<i>By the light of day</i>

25:03.956 --> 25:07.834
<i>But by night I'm one hell of a lover</i>

25:08.085 --> 25:11.588
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

25:13.131 --> 25:16.009
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

25:16.259 --> 25:19.262
<i>Transylvania</i>

25:21.807 --> 25:23.725
<i>Let me show you around</i>

25:23.976 --> 25:26.812
<i>Maybe play you a sound</i>

25:27.104 --> 25:30.565
<i>You look like you're both
Pretty groovy</i>

25:30.774 --> 25:33.527
<i>Or if you want something visual</i>

25:33.777 --> 25:35.988
<i>That's not too abysmal</i>

25:36.238 --> 25:39.533
<i>We could take in an old
Steve Reeves movie</i>

25:40.784 --> 25:43.287
<i>I'm glad we caught you at home</i>

25:44.121 --> 25:45.998
<i>Could we use your phone?</i>

25:46.498 --> 25:48.959
- <i>We're both in a bit of a hurry</i>
- <i>Right</i>

25:49.167 --> 25:51.003
<i>We'll just say where we are</i>

25:51.253 --> 25:54.589
- <i>Then go back to the car</i>
- <i>A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Furter</i>

25:54.840 --> 25:57.050
<i>We don't want to be any worry</i>

25:57.759 --> 26:01.221
<i>Well, you got caught with a flat</i>

26:01.430 --> 26:03.140
<i>Well, how about that</i>

26:03.390 --> 26:06.852
<i>Well, babies, don't you panic</i>

26:07.102 --> 26:09.396
<i>By the light of the night</i>

26:09.646 --> 26:11.648
<i>It'll all seem all right</i>

26:11.898 --> 26:15.736
<i>I'll get you a satanic mechanic</i>

26:15.944 --> 26:19.156
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

26:20.782 --> 26:23.744
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

26:23.994 --> 26:27.497
<i>Transylvania</i>

26:29.541 --> 26:31.627
<i>Why don't you stay for the night</i>

26:32.044 --> 26:34.171
- <i>Night</i>
- <i>Or maybe a bite</i>

26:34.421 --> 26:35.255
<i>Bite</i>

26:35.505 --> 26:38.717
<i>I could show you
My favorite obsession</i>

26:39.343 --> 26:42.095
<i>I've been making a man</i>

26:42.596 --> 26:44.723
<i>With blond hair and a tan</i>

26:44.973 --> 26:48.185
<i>And he's good for relieving
My tension</i>

26:48.435 --> 26:51.897
<i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>

26:53.857 --> 26:56.526
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

26:56.777 --> 27:00.030
<i>Transylvania</i>

27:01.073 --> 27:01.907
Hit it! Hit it!

27:02.115 --> 27:06.954
- <i>I'm just a sweet transvestite</i>
- <i>Sweet transvestite</i>

27:07.204 --> 27:10.248
<i>From Transsexual...</i>

27:10.457 --> 27:12.584
<i>Transylvania</i>

27:17.339 --> 27:19.883
<i>So come up to the lab</i>

27:20.759 --> 27:23.720
<i>And see what's on the slab</i>

27:24.930 --> 27:25.973
<i>I see you shiver</i>

27:26.181 --> 27:28.350
<i>With antici...</i>

27:30.268 --> 27:31.311
- <i>pation</i>

27:32.604 --> 27:34.523
<i>But maybe the rain</i>

27:35.816 --> 27:37.567
<i>Is really to blame</i>

27:38.360 --> 27:41.071
<i>So I'll remove the cause</i>

27:45.367 --> 27:46.910
<i>But not the symptom</i>

28:00.465 --> 28:01.508
Thank you.

28:05.429 --> 28:06.763
Thank you very much.

28:09.683 --> 28:10.726
Brad!

28:10.976 --> 28:15.314
We'll play along for now and pull out
the aces when the time is right.

28:16.523 --> 28:20.402
Slowly, slowly.
It's too nice a job to rush.

28:20.819 --> 28:25.741
Hi. My name's Brad Majors and
this is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.

28:29.578 --> 28:30.662
You are...?

28:30.912 --> 28:34.291
You are very lucky to be invited
up to Frank's laboratory.

28:34.541 --> 28:38.170
Some people would give their
right arm for the privilege.

28:38.420 --> 28:40.547
People like you, maybe?

28:40.797 --> 28:42.841
I've seen it.

28:47.095 --> 28:50.766
Come along. The master doesn't
like to be kept waiting.

28:51.058 --> 28:53.268
Shift it!

29:08.325 --> 29:11.828
Is he...? Frank, I mean,
is he your husband?

29:12.454 --> 29:16.416
The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think he ever will be.

29:16.667 --> 29:19.252
- We are simply his servants.
- Oh.

30:03.922 --> 30:05.215
Magenta.

30:06.425 --> 30:07.926
Columbia.

30:08.593 --> 30:10.846
Go and assist Riff Raff.

30:12.597 --> 30:14.391
I will entertain...

30:19.479 --> 30:22.649
Brad Majors and this is
my fiancée, Janet Vice.

30:22.899 --> 30:25.027
- Weiss.
- Weiss?

30:27.696 --> 30:29.615
<i>Enchanté.</i>

30:29.906 --> 30:32.534
Well, how nice.

30:32.826 --> 30:35.704
And what charming underclothes
you both have.

30:35.954 --> 30:39.458
But here, put these on.

30:39.708 --> 30:43.211
They'll make you feel less vulnerable.

30:44.504 --> 30:46.965
It's not often we receive visitors here.

30:47.215 --> 30:49.968
Let alone offer them hospitality.

30:50.218 --> 30:54.848
Hospitality! All we wanted to do
was use your telephone. Goddamn it!

30:55.098 --> 30:57.392
A reasonable request you have ignored!

30:57.643 --> 31:00.896
- Don't be ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!

31:01.396 --> 31:04.066
How forceful you are, Brad.

31:04.316 --> 31:08.695
Such a perfect specimen of manhood.
So dominant.

31:12.366 --> 31:15.702
You must be awfully proud of him, Janet.

31:16.203 --> 31:18.622
Well, yes, I am.

31:19.623 --> 31:22.793
- Do you have any tattoos, Brad?
- Certainly not.

31:23.001 --> 31:26.129
Oh, well. How about you?

31:26.421 --> 31:28.632
Everything is in readiness, master.

31:28.882 --> 31:31.969
We merely await your word.

31:40.268 --> 31:44.606
Tonight, my unconventional
conventionists...

31:45.524 --> 31:48.026
you are to witness a new breakthrough...

31:48.235 --> 31:51.405
in biochemical research.

31:51.655 --> 31:55.826
And paradise is to be mine!

32:00.539 --> 32:02.833
It was strange the way it happened.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.127
Suddenly...

32:05.961 --> 32:07.421
you get a break.

32:08.839 --> 32:12.217
All the pieces seem to fit into place.

32:12.592 --> 32:16.388
What a sucker you've been. What a fool.

32:16.680 --> 32:19.349
The answer was there all the time.

32:19.599 --> 32:24.104
It took a small accident
to make it happen.

32:25.022 --> 32:27.691
- An accident!
- An accident!

32:27.941 --> 32:30.485
That's how I discovered the secret.

32:31.111 --> 32:34.072
That elusive ingredient.

32:34.323 --> 32:36.783
That spark...

32:37.034 --> 32:40.078
that is the breath of life.

32:42.748 --> 32:44.041
Yes.

32:45.751 --> 32:49.046
I have that knowledge.

32:50.088 --> 32:52.424
I hold the secret...

32:52.674 --> 32:55.719
to life itself!

33:11.193 --> 33:12.361
You see...

33:12.903 --> 33:15.197
you are fortunate.

33:15.447 --> 33:18.492
For tonight is the night...

33:18.742 --> 33:23.872
that my beautiful creature
is destined to be born.

34:02.035 --> 34:06.206
Throw open the switches
on the sonic oscillator.

34:11.295 --> 34:14.547
And step up the reactor power input...

34:14.755 --> 34:17.509
three more points!

34:40.072 --> 34:41.283
Oh, Brad!

34:41.533 --> 34:43.327
It's all right, Janet.

36:30.726 --> 36:32.936
Oh, Rocky!

36:38.275 --> 36:43.238
<i>The sword of Damocles
Is hanging over my head</i>

36:44.364 --> 36:48.035
<i>I've got the feeling someone's
Gonna be cutting the thread</i>

36:52.039 --> 36:53.707
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

36:53.957 --> 36:56.877
<i>My life is a misery</i>

36:57.127 --> 36:59.338
<i>Oh, can't you see</i>

36:59.588 --> 37:02.549
<i>That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer</i>

37:05.636 --> 37:09.056
<i>I woke up this morning with a start
When I fell out of bed</i>

37:09.306 --> 37:11.433
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

37:11.683 --> 37:15.187
<i>And left from my dreaming
Was a feeling of unnameable dread</i>

37:15.437 --> 37:17.689
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

37:17.940 --> 37:20.567
<i>My high is low</i>

37:21.193 --> 37:23.695
<i>I'm dressed up with no place to go</i>

37:23.946 --> 37:26.615
<i>And all I know</i>

37:26.865 --> 37:30.994
<i>Is I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer</i>

37:33.705 --> 37:36.166
- <i>That ain't no crime.</i>
- <i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

37:36.416 --> 37:39.169
- <i>That ain't no crime.</i>
- <i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

37:39.378 --> 37:42.047
Oh, my baby!

37:44.967 --> 37:48.303
<i>The sword of Damocles
Is hanging over my head</i>

37:48.553 --> 37:50.806
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

37:51.014 --> 37:54.393
<i>I've got the feeling someone's
Gonna be cutting the thread</i>

37:54.643 --> 37:57.187
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

37:57.437 --> 38:00.232
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

38:00.482 --> 38:02.818
<i>My life is a mystery</i>

38:03.068 --> 38:05.821
<i>And can't you see</i>

38:06.071 --> 38:09.408
<i>That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer</i>

38:12.577 --> 38:15.414
- <i>That ain't no crime.</i>
- <i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

38:16.581 --> 38:18.458
<i>That ain't no crime</i>

38:37.352 --> 38:38.395
Well, really!

38:39.479 --> 38:42.316
That's no way to behave
on your first day out.

38:46.153 --> 38:50.657
But since you're such
an exceptional beauty...

38:51.033 --> 38:53.368
I'm prepared to forgive you.

38:58.832 --> 39:00.792
Oh, I just love success!

39:01.043 --> 39:03.420
- He is a credit to your genius.
- Yes.

39:03.670 --> 39:05.672
- A triumph of your will.
- Yes.

39:05.922 --> 39:07.299
He's okay.

39:11.595 --> 39:12.971
Okay?

39:15.766 --> 39:16.892
Okay?!

39:18.685 --> 39:21.313
I think we can do better than that.

39:25.651 --> 39:28.028
Now, Brad and Janet...

39:28.278 --> 39:30.280
what do you think of him?

39:30.948 --> 39:32.366
Well...

39:32.783 --> 39:36.328
I don't like men with too many muscles.

39:37.663 --> 39:40.290
I didn't make him for you!

39:41.416 --> 39:44.962
He carries the Charles Atlas
seal of approval.

39:56.139 --> 40:01.353
<i>A weakling weighing 98 pounds</i>

40:01.853 --> 40:04.564
<i>Will get sand in his face</i>

40:04.773 --> 40:07.359
<i>When kicked to the ground</i>

40:08.944 --> 40:11.905
<i>And soon in the gym</i>

40:12.155 --> 40:14.908
<i>With a determined chin</i>

40:15.534 --> 40:17.661
<i>The sweat from his pores</i>

40:20.205 --> 40:23.875
<i>As he works for his cause</i>

40:24.751 --> 40:26.962
<i>Will make him glisten</i>

40:28.297 --> 40:30.340
<i>And gleam</i>

40:30.841 --> 40:33.302
<i>And with massage</i>

40:33.552 --> 40:38.682
<i>And just a little bit of steam</i>

40:42.936 --> 40:45.355
<i>He'll be pink</i>

40:45.856 --> 40:48.609
<i>And quite clean</i>

40:48.859 --> 40:53.155
<i>He'll be a strong man</i>

40:54.114 --> 40:58.702
<i>Oh, honey
But the wrong man</i>

41:00.370 --> 41:04.041
<i>He'll eat nutritious high protein</i>

41:04.291 --> 41:06.752
<i>And swallow raw eggs</i>

41:07.002 --> 41:08.754
<i>Try to build up his shoulders</i>

41:09.004 --> 41:12.090
<i>His chest, arms and legs</i>

41:12.341 --> 41:17.095
<i>Such an effort
If he only knew of my plan</i>

41:17.346 --> 41:20.724
<i>In just seven days</i>

41:20.974 --> 41:25.604
<i>I can make you a man</i>

41:28.357 --> 41:31.026
<i>He'll do press-ups and chin-ups</i>

41:31.234 --> 41:33.403
<i>Do the snatch, clean and jerk</i>

41:34.446 --> 41:37.074
<i>He thinks dynamic tension</i>

41:37.282 --> 41:39.576
<i>Must be hard work</i>

41:39.826 --> 41:41.703
<i>Such strenuous living</i>

41:41.954 --> 41:44.206
<i>I just don't understand</i>

41:44.456 --> 41:48.961
<i>When in just seven days
Oh, baby</i>

41:49.169 --> 41:54.049
<i>I can make you a man</i>

42:01.765 --> 42:03.100
Eddie!

42:23.996 --> 42:26.832
<i>Whatever happened to Saturday night</i>

42:27.082 --> 42:32.379
<i>When you dressed sharp, felt all right
Don't seem the same since cosmic light</i>

42:32.629 --> 42:36.174
<i>Came into my life
I thought I was divine</i>

42:36.425 --> 42:41.513
<i>I'd go for a ride with chicks who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio</i>

42:41.722 --> 42:44.308
<i>A saxophone was blowing
On a rock 'n' roll show</i>

42:44.558 --> 42:49.187
<i>We climbed in the back seat
We really had a good time</i>

42:49.438 --> 42:52.065
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

42:52.608 --> 42:54.860
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

42:55.527 --> 42:58.238
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

42:58.488 --> 43:01.283
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

43:20.052 --> 43:21.637
Lovely party!

43:27.726 --> 43:30.354
<i>My head used to swim
From the perfume I smelled</i>

43:30.604 --> 43:33.440
<i>My hands kind of fumbled
With her white plastic belt</i>

43:33.649 --> 43:36.443
<i>I'd taste her baby pink lipstick
And that's when I'd melt</i>

43:36.693 --> 43:39.613
<i>She'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mine</i>

43:39.863 --> 43:44.826
<i>Get in front and put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his last song</i>

43:45.077 --> 43:48.080
<i>With your arms around your girl
You tried to sing along</i>

43:48.330 --> 43:52.793
<i>It felt pretty good
Really had a good time</i>

43:53.251 --> 43:56.171
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

43:56.421 --> 43:58.215
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

43:59.132 --> 44:01.593
<i>Hot patootie, bless my soul</i>

44:01.843 --> 44:04.554
<i>I really love that rock 'n' roll</i>

45:46.448 --> 45:48.575
One from the vaults.

45:59.294 --> 46:01.088
Oh, baby!

46:08.804 --> 46:10.681
Don't be upset.

46:12.808 --> 46:15.269
It was a mercy killing.

46:15.727 --> 46:19.231
He had a certain naive charm...

46:19.439 --> 46:21.650
but no muscle.

46:24.319 --> 46:26.989
<i>But a deltoid</i>

46:27.239 --> 46:30.325
<i>And a bicep</i>

46:30.575 --> 46:35.622
<i>A hot groin
And a tricep</i>

46:35.872 --> 46:38.250
<i>Makes me...</i>

46:39.334 --> 46:40.502
<i>shake</i>

46:40.752 --> 46:44.464
<i>Makes me want to take Charles Atlas</i>

46:44.673 --> 46:47.551
<i>By the hand</i>

46:47.801 --> 46:50.929
<i>In just seven days
Oh, baby</i>

46:51.179 --> 46:56.226
<i>I can make you a man</i>

46:59.271 --> 47:03.317
<i>I don't want no dissension</i>

47:04.860 --> 47:09.531
<i>Just dynamic tension</i>

47:11.033 --> 47:15.329
<i>I'm a muscle fan</i>

47:15.579 --> 47:18.874
<i>In just seven days</i>

47:19.249 --> 47:24.171
<i>I can make you a man</i>

47:25.088 --> 47:29.301
<i>Dig it if you can</i>

47:29.843 --> 47:33.055
<i>In just seven days</i>

47:33.263 --> 47:37.142
<i>I can make you a man</i>

47:50.530 --> 47:54.952
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!

48:09.841 --> 48:13.762
There are those who say
that life is an illusion...

48:14.012 --> 48:17.683
and that reality is simply
a figment of the imagination.

48:18.392 --> 48:22.062
If this is so, then Brad and Janet
are quite safe.

48:23.063 --> 48:27.109
However, the sudden departure
of their host...

48:27.359 --> 48:30.237
and his creation...

48:30.487 --> 48:33.657
into the seclusion
of his somber bridal suite...

48:33.907 --> 48:38.787
had left them feeling
both apprehensive and uneasy.

48:39.037 --> 48:42.708
A feeling which grew
as the other guests departed...

48:42.958 --> 48:47.504
and they were shown
to their separate rooms.

49:25.417 --> 49:28.003
Who is it? Who's there?

49:31.506 --> 49:33.425
It's only me, Janet.

49:33.925 --> 49:36.345
Brad, darling, come in.

49:38.513 --> 49:40.515
Oh, Brad!

49:41.850 --> 49:43.644
Yes, my darling! But what if...?

49:43.936 --> 49:45.938
Everything's going to be all right.

49:46.188 --> 49:49.483
Oh, I hope so, my darling.

49:52.110 --> 49:56.573
- It's you!
- I'm afraid so. But isn't it nice?

49:56.865 --> 50:01.286
You beast, you monster!
What have you done with Brad?

50:01.536 --> 50:04.498
Well, nothing.
Why, do you think I should?

50:04.790 --> 50:08.168
You tricked me! I wouldn't have.
I've never, never...

50:08.460 --> 50:10.671
Yes. Yes, I know.

50:10.963 --> 50:13.256
But it isn't all bad, is it?

50:14.132 --> 50:17.636
I think you'll really find it
quite pleasurable.

50:18.387 --> 50:20.806
- So soft, so sensual.
- Stop! I mean, help!

50:21.056 --> 50:22.849
Brad. Oh, Brad!

50:23.976 --> 50:28.188
Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you like this?

50:28.480 --> 50:32.025
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame!

50:32.234 --> 50:34.528
I was saving myself.

50:34.987 --> 50:39.116
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.

50:39.825 --> 50:41.618
Promise you won't tell Brad?

50:41.827 --> 50:44.955
Cross my heart and hope to die.

52:35.691 --> 52:38.652
Oh, Brad, darling, it's no good here!

52:38.944 --> 52:40.487
It'll destroy us.

52:40.779 --> 52:44.032
Don't worry. We'll be away from here
in the morning.

52:44.283 --> 52:47.369
Oh, Brad, you're so strong
and protective.

52:51.540 --> 52:53.000
You!

52:53.208 --> 52:55.961
I'm afraid so, Brad. But isn't it nice?

52:56.211 --> 52:59.298
Why you...
What have you done with Janet?

52:59.548 --> 53:02.009
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?

53:02.301 --> 53:07.180
You tricked me. I wouldn't have.
I've never, never, never!

53:07.472 --> 53:10.142
Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?

53:10.392 --> 53:14.479
Not even half bad.
I think you'll really quite enjoy it.

53:15.397 --> 53:18.358
- So soft. So sensual.
- No, stop.

53:18.650 --> 53:20.110
Oh, Janet.

53:20.902 --> 53:22.195
Janet!

53:22.821 --> 53:26.825
Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?

53:27.075 --> 53:31.163
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame.

53:31.413 --> 53:33.498
I thought it was the real thing!

53:33.749 --> 53:35.542
Oh, come on, Brad, admit it.

53:35.834 --> 53:37.628
You liked it, didn't you?

53:37.919 --> 53:41.214
There's no crime in giving yourself
over to pleasure.

53:41.506 --> 53:45.344
Oh, Brad, you have wasted
so much time already.

53:45.594 --> 53:49.097
Janet needn't know. I won't tell her.

53:49.848 --> 53:51.808
You promise you won't tell?

53:53.018 --> 53:55.354
On my mother's grave.

53:56.521 --> 54:00.275
<i>Master, Rocky has broken his chains
and vanished.</i>

54:00.525 --> 54:04.446
<i>The new playmate is loose
and somewhere in the castle grounds.</i>

54:04.696 --> 54:08.075
<i>Magenta has just released the dogs.</i>

54:10.452 --> 54:12.454
Coming!

54:16.625 --> 54:20.045
What's happening here? Where's Brad?

54:20.712 --> 54:22.881
Where's anybody?

54:31.556 --> 54:33.642
Oh, Brad!

54:34.226 --> 54:39.356
Brad, my darling, how could I
have done this to you?

54:50.492 --> 54:53.662
Oh, If only we hadn't made this journey.

54:54.579 --> 54:57.249
If only the car hadn't broken down.

54:58.417 --> 55:03.422
If only we were amongst friends
or sane persons.

55:04.673 --> 55:06.883
Oh, Brad.

55:09.344 --> 55:11.096
What have they done with him?

55:17.102 --> 55:20.647
Brad, how could you?

55:45.380 --> 55:47.341
But you're hurt.

55:48.634 --> 55:51.094
Did they do this to you?

55:54.056 --> 55:55.974
Here. I'll dress your wounds.

55:57.809 --> 56:00.062
Baby, there. Oh.

56:11.239 --> 56:15.494
<i>"Emotion: agitation or disturbance
of mind...</i>

56:15.744 --> 56:19.873
vehement or excited mental state."

56:21.667 --> 56:25.712
It is also a powerful
and irrational master.

56:25.921 --> 56:30.759
And from what Magenta and Columbia
eagerly viewed on their TV monitor...

56:31.009 --> 56:34.680
<i>there seemed little doubt
that Janet was indeed...</i>

56:34.930 --> 56:36.390
<i>its slave.</i>

56:37.099 --> 56:40.102
Tell us about it, Janet.

56:42.938 --> 56:46.775
<i>I was feeling done in</i>

56:47.442 --> 56:49.278
<i>Couldn't win</i>

56:50.612 --> 56:54.074
<i>I'd only ever kissed before</i>

56:56.201 --> 56:57.661
You mean she...?

56:57.953 --> 57:01.581
<i>I thought there's no use getting</i>

57:01.790 --> 57:04.960
<i>Into heavy petting</i>

57:05.210 --> 57:09.506
<i>It only leads to trouble</i>

57:09.715 --> 57:11.883
<i>And seat wetting</i>

57:12.384 --> 57:15.345
<i>Now all I want to know</i>

57:16.138 --> 57:18.473
<i>Is how to go</i>

57:18.724 --> 57:21.727
<i>I've tasted blood and I want more</i>

57:21.977 --> 57:23.770
More, more, more.

57:24.396 --> 57:27.065
<i>I'll put up no resistance</i>

57:27.316 --> 57:29.568
<i>I want to stay the distance</i>

57:30.402 --> 57:32.487
<i>I've got an itch to scratch</i>

57:33.488 --> 57:35.782
<i>I need assistance</i>

57:36.074 --> 57:38.535
<i>Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me</i>

57:38.827 --> 57:41.413
<i>I wanna be dirty</i>

Down, down, down.

58:03.769 --> 58:08.732
<i>And that's just one small fraction
Of the main attraction</i>

58:09.858 --> 58:12.069
<i>You need a friendly hand</i>

58:12.361 --> 58:14.613
<i>Oh, and I need action</i>

58:14.863 --> 58:17.532
<i>Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me</i>

58:17.783 --> 58:20.327
<i>I wanna be dirty</i>

Creature of the night.

58:50.399 --> 58:52.526
Creature of the night?

58:53.151 --> 58:55.028
Creature of the night.

58:55.821 --> 58:57.197
Creature of the night.

58:58.573 --> 59:00.450
Creature of the night.

Creature of the night.

<i>Creature of the night</i>

59:15.257 --> 59:17.551
Mercy!

59:20.262 --> 59:21.972
How did it happen?

59:22.264 --> 59:25.892
I understood you were to be watching.

59:26.184 --> 59:29.271
I was only away for a minute, master.

59:29.521 --> 59:34.443
Well, see if you can find him
on the monitor.

59:41.450 --> 59:42.826
Master.

59:43.118 --> 59:46.330
Master, we have a visitor.

59:51.627 --> 59:52.794
Hey, Scotty!

59:55.047 --> 59:56.131
Dr. Everett Scott.

59:56.381 --> 59:59.718
You know this earthling... this person?

59:59.968 --> 01:00:04.097
I most certainly do. He happens
to be an old friend of mine.

01:00:04.389 --> 01:00:06.141
I see.

01:00:06.892 --> 01:00:10.103
So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.

01:00:10.562 --> 01:00:12.940
You came here with a purpose.

01:00:13.482 --> 01:00:17.152
I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.

01:00:17.402 --> 01:00:19.905
I know what you told me, Brad.

01:00:20.155 --> 01:00:24.910
But this Dr. Everett Scott,
his name is not unknown to me.

01:00:25.577 --> 01:00:27.704
He was a science teacher at Denton High.

01:00:27.996 --> 01:00:30.165
And now he works for your government.

01:00:31.083 --> 01:00:33.877
He's attached
to the Bureau of Investigation...

01:00:34.086 --> 01:00:37.673
of that which you call UFOs!
Isn't that right, Brad?

01:00:37.923 --> 01:00:40.342
He might be. I don't know.

01:00:40.592 --> 01:00:43.679
The intruder is entering
the building, master.

01:00:46.515 --> 01:00:50.394
He'll probably be in the Zen Room.

01:00:57.442 --> 01:01:01.196
Shall we inquire of him in person?

01:01:35.897 --> 01:01:36.773
Great Scott!

01:01:48.994 --> 01:01:50.245
Frank N. Furter.

01:01:51.413 --> 01:01:52.748
We meet at last.

01:01:54.666 --> 01:01:56.293
Dr. Scott!

01:01:56.752 --> 01:01:58.879
Brad! What are you doing here?

01:02:00.172 --> 01:02:02.507
Don't play games, Dr. Scott.

01:02:03.342 --> 01:02:06.428
You know perfectly well
what Brad Majors is doing here.

01:02:06.762 --> 01:02:08.805
It was part of your plan, was it not?

01:02:09.097 --> 01:02:12.893
That he and his female
should check the layout for you?

01:02:13.518 --> 01:02:18.023
Well, unfortunately for you all,
the plans are to be changed.

01:02:19.524 --> 01:02:22.527
I hope you're adaptable, Dr. Scott.

01:02:22.778 --> 01:02:25.030
I know Brad is.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.368
I assure you, Brad's presence
comes as a complete surprise to me.

01:02:29.618 --> 01:02:31.495
I came here to find Eddie.

01:02:32.537 --> 01:02:34.706
- Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
- Eddie?

01:02:34.957 --> 01:02:36.792
What do you know of Eddie?

01:02:37.876 --> 01:02:40.545
I know a great deal
about a lot of things.

01:02:40.796 --> 01:02:43.840
You see, Eddie happens to be my nephew.

01:02:49.137 --> 01:02:50.681
Dr. Scott.

01:02:54.893 --> 01:02:56.520
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!

01:02:56.812 --> 01:02:58.063
- Janet!
- Brad!

01:02:58.313 --> 01:02:59.398
Rocky!

01:02:59.648 --> 01:03:01.316
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!

01:03:01.566 --> 01:03:03.026
- Janet!
- Brad!

01:03:03.318 --> 01:03:04.403
Rocky!

01:03:08.657 --> 01:03:12.369
Listen! I made you...

01:03:12.661 --> 01:03:16.331
and I can break you just as easily.

01:03:19.167 --> 01:03:22.296
Master, dinner is prepared!

01:03:25.173 --> 01:03:26.508
Excellent.

01:03:27.676 --> 01:03:32.389
Under the circumstances,
formal dress is to be optional.

01:03:35.183 --> 01:03:39.688
Food has always played a vital role
in life's rituals:

01:03:39.938 --> 01:03:44.526
The breaking of bread,
the last meal of the condemned man...

01:03:44.776 --> 01:03:48.155
and now this meal.

01:03:48.697 --> 01:03:51.617
<i>However informal it might appear...</i>

01:03:51.867 --> 01:03:56.204
<i>you can be sure there was to be
very little bonhomie.</i>

01:05:12.864 --> 01:05:13.865
A toast.

01:05:15.784 --> 01:05:17.953
To absent friends.

01:05:18.453 --> 01:05:20.455
To absent friends.

01:05:24.042 --> 01:05:26.712
And Rocky.

01:05:35.804 --> 01:05:37.514
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:05:37.806 --> 01:05:39.683
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:05:39.975 --> 01:05:41.935
<i>Happy birthday, dear Rocky</i>

01:05:42.227 --> 01:05:44.104
- <i>Happy birthday...</i>
- Shall we?

01:06:02.831 --> 01:06:05.709
We came here to discuss Eddie.

01:06:06.001 --> 01:06:07.336
Eddie!

01:06:11.673 --> 01:06:13.342
It's a rather tender subject.

01:06:14.092 --> 01:06:16.136
Another slice, anyone?

01:06:22.267 --> 01:06:24.061
Excuse me.

01:06:35.948 --> 01:06:39.618
I knew he was in with a bad crowd,
but it was worse than I imagined.

01:06:39.868 --> 01:06:41.495
Aliens!

01:06:41.787 --> 01:06:42.704
Dr. Scott!

01:06:43.455 --> 01:06:45.123
Go on, Dr. Scott.

01:06:46.375 --> 01:06:49.670
Or should I say Dr. Von Scott?

01:06:50.545 --> 01:06:53.048
Just what exactly are you implying?

01:06:53.298 --> 01:06:54.508
It's all right!

01:06:54.716 --> 01:06:56.468
That's all right, Brad.

01:06:59.972 --> 01:07:02.391
<i>From the day he was born</i>

01:07:05.227 --> 01:07:08.063
<i>He was trouble</i>

01:07:10.065 --> 01:07:12.859
<i>He was the thorn</i>

01:07:14.403 --> 01:07:17.864
<i>In his mother's side</i>

01:07:19.825 --> 01:07:23.078
<i>She tried in vain</i>

01:07:26.081 --> 01:07:30.377
<i>But he never caused her
Nothing but shame</i>

01:07:31.336 --> 01:07:34.673
<i>He left home...</i>

01:07:34.923 --> 01:07:38.135
<i>the day she died</i>

01:07:38.427 --> 01:07:40.596
<i>From the day she was gone</i>

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.724
<i>All he wanted</i>

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.852
<i>Was rock 'n' roll porn</i>

01:07:47.519 --> 01:07:49.980
Und <i>a motorbike</i>

01:07:50.606 --> 01:07:53.108
<i>Shooting up junk</i>

01:07:54.192 --> 01:07:57.321
<i>He was a low-down, cheap little punk</i>

01:07:57.613 --> 01:08:02.701
<i>Taking everyone for a ride</i>

01:08:03.619 --> 01:08:06.288
<i>When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy</i>

01:08:06.538 --> 01:08:08.999
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

01:08:09.291 --> 01:08:12.085
<i>But when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife</i>

01:08:12.377 --> 01:08:13.754
- <i>What a guy</i>
- <i>Makes you cry</i>

01:08:13.962 --> 01:08:15.422
Und <i>I did</i>

01:08:15.964 --> 01:08:18.800
<i>Everybody shoved him</i>

01:08:19.051 --> 01:08:22.095
<i>I very nearly loved him</i>

01:08:22.386 --> 01:08:25.057
<i>I said, hey, listen to me</i>

01:08:25.307 --> 01:08:28.185
<i>Stay sane inside insanity</i>

01:08:28.477 --> 01:08:33.564
<i>But he locked the door
And threw away the key</i>

01:08:33.814 --> 01:08:35.692
<i>But he must've been drawn</i>

01:08:37.402 --> 01:08:39.029
<i>Into something</i>

01:08:40.322 --> 01:08:42.448
<i>Making him warn me</i>

01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:44.368
<i>In a note which reads:</i>

01:08:44.576 --> 01:08:46.078
<i>What's it say? What's it say?</i>

01:08:46.328 --> 01:08:47.703
<i>"I'm out of my head</i>

01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:52.334
<i>Oh, hurry, or I may be dead</i>

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:58.048
<i>They mustn't carry out
Their evil deeds"</i>

01:08:59.341 --> 01:09:02.135
<i>When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy</i>

01:09:02.344 --> 01:09:04.136
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

01:09:04.845 --> 01:09:07.515
<i>When he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife</i>

01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:09.434
- <i>What a guy</i>
- <i>Makes you cry</i>

01:09:09.685 --> 01:09:11.103
Und <i>I did</i>

01:09:11.353 --> 01:09:13.814
<i>When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy</i>

01:09:14.022 --> 01:09:16.441
<i>You knew he was a no-good kid</i>

01:09:16.692 --> 01:09:19.944
<i>But when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife</i>

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:25.617
- <i>What a guy</i>
- <i>Woe, woe, woe</i>

01:09:25.867 --> 01:09:30.497
- <i>Makes you cry</i>
- <i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

01:09:30.788 --> 01:09:34.209
Und <i>I did</i>

01:09:34.459 --> 01:09:38.255
<i>Hey</i>

01:09:39.881 --> 01:09:40.924
Oh.

01:09:52.477 --> 01:09:53.895
Oh, Rocky!

01:09:56.064 --> 01:09:58.233
How could you?!

01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:08.035
This way! This way!

01:10:10.996 --> 01:10:12.289
Shut up!

01:10:13.832 --> 01:10:17.002
<i>I'll tell you once
I won't tell you twice</i>

01:10:17.252 --> 01:10:20.797
<i>You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss</i>

01:10:21.089 --> 01:10:24.426
<i>Your apple pie
Don't taste too nice</i>

01:10:24.676 --> 01:10:28.013
<i>You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss</i>

01:10:34.853 --> 01:10:38.315
<i>I've laid the seed
It should be all you need</i>

01:10:38.607 --> 01:10:40.484
<i>You're as sensual as a pencil</i>

01:10:40.776 --> 01:10:42.361
<i>Wound up like an E or first string</i>

01:10:42.611 --> 01:10:45.155
<i>When we made it
Did ya hear a bell ring?</i>

01:10:45.864 --> 01:10:48.951
<i>You got a block
Well, take my advice</i>

01:10:49.201 --> 01:10:53.288
<i>You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss</i>

01:10:53.705 --> 01:10:57.209
<i>The transducer
Will seduce ya</i>

01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:02.089
My feet! I can't move my feet!

01:11:02.381 --> 01:11:05.425
My wheels!
My God, I can't move my wheels.

01:11:06.969 --> 01:11:09.137
It's as if we were glued to the spot.

01:11:09.638 --> 01:11:11.223
You are.

01:11:11.682 --> 01:11:15.018
So quake with fear, you tiny fools.

01:11:16.561 --> 01:11:17.854
We're trapped.

01:11:18.522 --> 01:11:22.484
<i>It's something you'll get used to
A mental mind fuck can be nice</i>

01:11:22.693 --> 01:11:23.527
No!

01:11:23.777 --> 01:11:26.989
You won't find Earth people
the easy mark you imagine.

01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:29.199
This sonic transducer...

01:11:29.449 --> 01:11:33.870
it is some kind of audio-vibratory,
physiomolecular transport device?

01:11:34.162 --> 01:11:35.664
- You mean...?
- Yes, Brad.

01:11:35.914 --> 01:11:39.376
It's something we ourselves
have been working on for a while.

01:11:39.668 --> 01:11:43.463
But it seems our friend here has found
a means of perfecting it.

01:11:43.755 --> 01:11:47.009
A device capable
of breaking down solid matter...

01:11:47.259 --> 01:11:50.637
and then projecting it
through space, and who knows...

01:11:50.887 --> 01:11:54.433
perhaps even time itself!

01:11:54.683 --> 01:11:57.102
He's gonna send us to another planet?

01:11:57.352 --> 01:12:00.480
Planet schmanet, Janet.

01:12:01.106 --> 01:12:04.109
<i>You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss</i>

01:12:04.401 --> 01:12:08.363
<i>You'd better wise up
Build your thighs up</i>

01:12:08.572 --> 01:12:10.073
<i>You'd better wise up</i>

01:12:10.365 --> 01:12:12.451
And then she cried out:

01:12:12.743 --> 01:12:14.453
Stop!

01:12:18.624 --> 01:12:23.754
<i>Don't get hot and flustered</i>

01:12:24.546 --> 01:12:28.800
<i>Use a bit of mustard</i>

01:12:29.051 --> 01:12:31.720
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

01:12:32.012 --> 01:12:34.681
<i>But you'd better not...</i>

01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:37.976
<i>try to hurt her</i>

01:12:38.477 --> 01:12:39.603
<i>Frank Furter</i>

01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:43.398
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

01:12:43.649 --> 01:12:46.443
<i>But you'd better not...</i>

01:12:46.735 --> 01:12:49.655
<i>try to hurt her</i>

01:12:50.072 --> 01:12:51.490
<i>Frank Furter</i>

01:12:52.658 --> 01:12:54.826
<i>You're a hot dog</i>

01:12:57.245 --> 01:13:01.166
My God! I can't stand any more of this.

01:13:01.416 --> 01:13:06.338
First, you spurn me for Eddie, then you
toss him like an old coat for Rocky.

01:13:06.964 --> 01:13:10.300
You chew people up
and then you spit them out again.

01:13:11.134 --> 01:13:12.427
I loved you.

01:13:13.095 --> 01:13:14.888
Do you hear me? I loved you.

01:13:15.097 --> 01:13:18.642
And what did it get me?
I'll tell you, a big nothing.

01:13:18.934 --> 01:13:23.063
You're like a sponge. You drain
others of their love and emotion.

01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:24.898
Well, I've had enough!

01:13:25.148 --> 01:13:29.236
Choose between me and Rocky, so named
because of the rocks in his head.

01:13:40.038 --> 01:13:42.833
It's not easy, having a good time.

01:13:51.133 --> 01:13:54.303
Even smiling makes my face ache.

01:13:57.723 --> 01:14:00.559
And my children turn on me.

01:14:01.059 --> 01:14:04.313
Rocky's behaving just the way
that Eddie did.

01:14:07.065 --> 01:14:08.317
Maybe I made a mistake...

01:14:08.567 --> 01:14:11.403
splitting his brain
between the two of them.

01:14:11.653 --> 01:14:13.947
I grow weary of this world!

01:14:14.197 --> 01:14:17.451
When shall we return to Transylvania?!

01:14:18.577 --> 01:14:20.162
Magenta...

01:14:20.829 --> 01:14:24.458
I am indeed grateful to both you
and your brother, Riff Raff.

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:27.252
You have both served me well.

01:14:27.502 --> 01:14:31.548
Loyalty such as yours
shall not go unrewarded.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.428
You'll discover that when the mood
takes me, I can be quite generous.

01:14:36.637 --> 01:14:39.765
I ask for nothing, master.

01:14:40.265 --> 01:14:44.353
And you shall receive it in abundance!

01:14:46.438 --> 01:14:49.775
Come. We are ready for the floorshow.

01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:23.016
<i>And so, by some extraordinary
coincidence...</i>

01:15:23.225 --> 01:15:26.144
fate, it seemed, had decided
that Brad and Janet...

01:15:26.395 --> 01:15:30.274
should keep that appointment
with their friend Dr. Everett Scott.

01:15:30.565 --> 01:15:32.442
But it was to be in a situation...

01:15:32.734 --> 01:15:35.862
which none of them could have
possibly foreseen.

01:15:36.071 --> 01:15:40.534
And just a few hours
after announcing their engagement...

01:15:40.784 --> 01:15:44.413
Brad and Janet had both tasted...

01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:47.332
forbidden fruit.

01:15:48.834 --> 01:15:50.502
This in itself was proof...

01:15:50.752 --> 01:15:54.131
that their host
was a man of little morals...

01:15:54.423 --> 01:15:57.342
and some persuasion.

01:15:58.093 --> 01:16:02.764
What further indignities
were they to be subjected to?

01:16:03.098 --> 01:16:07.978
And what of the floorshow
that had been spoken of?

01:16:08.604 --> 01:16:11.356
In an empty house...

01:16:11.607 --> 01:16:14.568
in the middle of the night?

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.571
What diabolical plan...

01:16:17.821 --> 01:16:21.950
had seized Frank's crazed imagination?

01:16:23.869 --> 01:16:25.912
What indeed?

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:30.125
From what had gone before,
it was clear...

01:16:30.375 --> 01:16:33.879
that this was to be no picnic.

01:17:02.407 --> 01:17:06.203
<i>It was great when it all began</i>

01:17:06.495 --> 01:17:11.166
<i>I was a regular Frankie fan</i>

01:17:11.416 --> 01:17:14.836
<i>But it was over when he had the plan</i>

01:17:15.128 --> 01:17:19.299
<i>To start working on a muscleman</i>

01:17:19.508 --> 01:17:23.262
<i>Now the only thing that gives me hope</i>

01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:28.058
<i>Is my love of a certain dope</i>

01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:30.894
<i>Rose tints my world</i>

01:17:31.186 --> 01:17:34.982
<i>Keeps me safe
From my trouble and pain</i>

01:17:36.483 --> 01:17:40.404
<i>I'm just seven hours old</i>

01:17:40.654 --> 01:17:43.657
<i>Truly beautiful to behold</i>

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.495
<i>And somebody should be told</i>

01:17:48.787 --> 01:17:52.708
<i>My libido hasn't been controlled</i>

01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:57.045
<i>Now the only thing I've come to trust</i>

01:17:57.462 --> 01:18:01.633
<i>Is an orgasmic rush of lust</i>

01:18:01.967 --> 01:18:03.510
<i>Rose tints my world</i>

01:18:03.802 --> 01:18:08.098
<i>And keeps me safe
From my trouble and pain</i>

01:18:10.559 --> 01:18:14.396
<i>It's beyond me</i>

01:18:14.646 --> 01:18:18.775
<i>Help me, Mommy</i>

01:18:19.067 --> 01:18:22.738
<i>I'll be good, you'll see</i>

01:18:22.988 --> 01:18:26.450
<i>Take this dream away</i>

01:18:27.242 --> 01:18:29.703
<i>What's this</i>

01:18:29.995 --> 01:18:31.872
<i>Let's see</i>

01:18:32.164 --> 01:18:35.626
<i>I feel sexy</i>

01:18:37.085 --> 01:18:39.796
<i>What's come over me</i>

01:18:40.255 --> 01:18:43.008
<i>Here it comes again</i>

01:18:46.303 --> 01:18:50.057
<i>I feel released</i>

01:18:50.349 --> 01:18:53.560
<i>Bad times deceased</i>

01:18:53.769 --> 01:18:57.022
<i>My confidence has increased</i>

01:18:58.357 --> 01:19:01.485
<i>Reality is here</i>

01:19:01.693 --> 01:19:05.906
<i>The game has been disbanded</i>

01:19:06.156 --> 01:19:09.618
<i>My mind has been expanded</i>

01:19:09.826 --> 01:19:13.038
<i>It's a gas that Frankie's landed</i>

01:19:14.206 --> 01:19:18.794
<i>His lust is so sincere</i>

01:19:54.579 --> 01:19:56.456

<i>As it clung to her thigh</i>

01:20:12.097 --> 01:20:17.185
<i>How I started to cry</i>

01:20:18.645 --> 01:20:21.607
<i>'Cause I wanted to be dressed</i>

01:20:21.857 --> 01:20:26.153
<i>Just the same</i>

01:20:27.446 --> 01:20:29.615
<i>Give yourself over</i>

01:20:29.865 --> 01:20:33.910
<i>To absolute pleasure</i>

01:20:34.202 --> 01:20:37.247

01:20:37.539 --> 01:20:41.209

01:20:44.546 --> 01:20:48.300
<i>Beyond any measure</i>

01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:51.845
<i>And sensual daydreams</i>

01:20:52.137 --> 01:20:56.642
<i>To treasure forever</i>

01:20:56.892 --> 01:21:02.022
<i>Can't you just see it</i>

01:21:15.452 --> 01:21:18.497
<i>Don't dream it</i>

01:21:19.831 --> 01:21:22.668
<i>Be it</i>

01:21:22.918 --> 01:21:26.630
<i>Don't dream it</i>

01:21:27.589 --> 01:21:30.384

01:21:30.634 --> 01:21:33.720
<i>Don't dream it</i>

01:21:35.097 --> 01:21:36.932
<i>Be it</i>

01:21:45.607 --> 01:21:50.070
<i>Don't dream it</i>

01:21:50.362 --> 01:21:52.864
<i>Be it</i>

out of this trap...

01:22:37.743 --> 01:22:40.037

<i>Your mission is a failure</i>

01:24:51.710 --> 01:24:55.172

Wait!

01:25:17.569 --> 01:25:19.321
I can explain.

01:25:48.934 --> 01:25:53.063
<i>On the day I went away</i>

<i>Now I</i>

01:26:27.472 --> 01:26:32.561
<i>Blue skies through the tears</i>

01:26:33.729 --> 01:26:34.730
<i>In my eyes</i>

01:26:38.066 --> 01:26:40.360
<i>And I realize</i>

01:26:43.155 --> 01:26:45.991
<i>I'm going home</i>

01:26:50.162 --> 01:26:53.707
<i>I'm going home</i>

01:27:00.923 --> 01:27:04.551
<i>Everywhere it's been the same</i>

01:27:05.344 --> 01:27:09.056
<i>Feeling</i>

01:27:09.348 --> 01:27:12.726
<i>Like I'm outside in the rain</i>

01:27:13.018 --> 01:27:16.021
<i>Wheeling</i>

<i>That I'm going home</i>

01:28:00.482 --> 01:28:05.237
<i>I'm going home</i>

01:28:08.073 --> 01:28:11.493
<i>I'm going home</i>

01:28:16.415 --> 01:28:21.503
<i>I'm going home</i>

01:28:45.777 --> 01:28:48.822
How sentimental.

01:29:00.375 --> 01:29:02.544
And also presumptuous of you.

01:29:04.546 --> 01:29:07.591
You see, when I said "we"...

01:29:07.841 --> 01:29:10.427
were to return to Transylvania...

01:29:10.719 --> 01:29:13.055
I referred only to Magenta and myself.

01:29:14.056 --> 01:29:17.392
I'm sorry, however, if you found
my words misleading...

01:29:17.643 --> 01:29:18.685
but you see...

01:29:18.977 --> 01:29:21.772
you are to remain here.

01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:24.691
In spirit anyway.

01:29:26.318 --> 01:29:28.028
Good heavens, that's a laser.

01:29:28.236 --> 01:29:29.613
Yes, Dr. Scott.

01:29:30.405 --> 01:29:34.284
A laser capable of emitting
a beam of pure anti-matter.

01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:37.120
You're going to kill him?

01:29:37.746 --> 01:29:40.749
- What's his crime?
- You saw what became of Eddie.

01:29:40.999 --> 01:29:43.210
Society must be protected.

01:29:43.585 --> 01:29:45.754
Exactly, Dr. Scott.

01:29:46.004 --> 01:29:48.882
Now, Frank N. Furter, your time has come

01:29:49.591 --> 01:29:53.053
Say goodbye to all of this...

01:29:54.429 --> 01:29:58.350
and hello to oblivion.

01:30:15.701 --> 01:30:16.827
No.

01:30:17.369 --> 01:30:18.370
No.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:20.163
No!

01:31:50.295 --> 01:31:51.713
Good God!

01:31:52.965 --> 01:31:54.216
You killed them.

01:31:54.466 --> 01:31:59.221
But I thought you liked them.
They liked you.

01:31:59.888 --> 01:32:02.349
They didn't like me!

01:32:03.308 --> 01:32:05.686
They never liked me!

01:32:05.978 --> 01:32:07.771
You did right.

01:32:21.994 --> 01:32:25.080
A decision had to be made.

01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:27.791
You're okay by me.

01:32:28.917 --> 01:32:30.919
Dr. Scott...

01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:36.258
I'm sorry about your nephew.

01:32:36.508 --> 01:32:37.801
Eddie?

01:32:38.343 --> 01:32:41.555
Yes, well, perhaps it was for the best.

01:32:43.932 --> 01:32:48.020
You should leave now, Dr. Scott,
while it is still possible.

01:32:48.353 --> 01:32:51.023
We are about to beam the entire house...

01:32:51.273 --> 01:32:53.984
back to the planet of Transsexual...

01:32:54.276 --> 01:32:57.404
in the galaxy of Transylvania.

01:32:58.947 --> 01:33:00.115
Go.

01:33:01.366 --> 01:33:02.618
Now.

01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:19.301
Our noble mission is almost completed...

01:33:20.802 --> 01:33:23.055
my most beautiful sister.

01:33:23.889 --> 01:33:28.268
And soon we shall return
to the moon-drenched shores...

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:30.771
of our beloved planet.

01:33:32.481 --> 01:33:36.818
Sweet Transsexual.

01:33:37.903 --> 01:33:40.781
Land of night.

01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:46.828
To sing and dance once more
to your dark refrain.

01:33:52.084 --> 01:33:53.919
To take that...

01:33:55.754 --> 01:33:58.924
step to the right.

01:34:00.926 --> 01:34:03.720
<i>But it's the pelvic thrust</i>

01:34:04.012 --> 01:34:07.266
<i>That really drives you insane</i>

01:34:07.849 --> 01:34:10.811
And our world...

01:34:11.103 --> 01:34:16.024
will do the time warp again!

01:34:58.488 --> 01:35:00.490
<i>And crawling</i>

01:35:01.908 --> 01:35:04.452
