03:17.000 --> 03:18.585
It's happening!

03:22.755 --> 03:24.382
Wait up, guys!

03:32.765 --> 03:34.225
The baby's coming! The baby's coming!

03:34.350 --> 03:35.810
- Watch it!
- I'm having a baby!

03:35.935 --> 03:39.314
- Code Blue! Code Blue!
- Or pink if it's a girl!

03:39.439 --> 03:42.567
Having a baby! Having a baby!
I'm coming, Ellie!

03:42.984 --> 03:44.319
We got it!

03:58.374 --> 03:59.918
Ellie! Ellie!

04:00.043 --> 04:03.087
Ellie, where are you? Where am I?

04:03.212 --> 04:04.339
Manny?

04:05.381 --> 04:07.675
I told you it was just a kick.

04:10.803 --> 04:13.764
Right! Right! Wow.

04:14.932 --> 04:19.228
You really gave Daddy a scare!
Daddy got silly!

04:19.353 --> 04:22.606
Daddy fall down cliff
and go boom, boom, boom.

04:22.731 --> 04:25.525
Silly Daddy. Yeah.

04:29.863 --> 04:33.283
Sorry, folks! False alarm!
It was just a kick!

04:34.826 --> 04:38.288
- You know who I'd like to kick?
- That's the third false alarm this week.

04:38.413 --> 04:41.667
All right, show's over, break it up!
Break it up!

04:42.417 --> 04:45.337
I see someone else
who has a bun in the oven!

04:45.837 --> 04:47.589
I'm not pregnant!

04:48.757 --> 04:51.718
That's too bad.
You'd make a wonderful mother!

04:52.886 --> 04:57.808
Manny, I know you're excited. I am, too.
But you're getting a little carried away.

04:57.933 --> 05:02.688
Okay, okay!
Boy, you're starting to sound like Diego.

05:03.730 --> 05:06.024
Wait a second. Where is Diego?

06:01.704 --> 06:04.832
My hooves are burning, baby!
They are burning!

06:05.750 --> 06:07.710
Look at this. I got to tip-toe!
I got to tip-toe!

06:07.835 --> 06:09.587
Eat my dust, dingo!

06:13.007 --> 06:15.468
Now? Can I look now?

06:15.843 --> 06:18.387
Easy. Don't freak out the baby.

06:18.512 --> 06:22.266
The baby's fine. It's the freaked-out daddy
I'm worried about.

06:22.642 --> 06:24.227
No peeking!

06:25.478 --> 06:28.064
VoilÃ ! Playground for Junior!

06:29.815 --> 06:30.858
Wow.

06:38.491 --> 06:40.952
It's amazing!

06:52.296 --> 06:53.548
Manny.

06:53.673 --> 06:56.425
I made it myself. Our family.

07:02.974 --> 07:04.684
Hey, why aren't I up there?

07:04.809 --> 07:08.354
- You can be on ours.
- You'd fit right in!

07:09.063 --> 07:10.439
Thanks!

07:10.565 --> 07:15.361
Of course, it's still a work in progress.
A few rough edges here and there.

07:16.279 --> 07:19.490
I don't believe it.
You're trying to baby-proof nature.

07:19.615 --> 07:23.369
Baby-proof nature? Get out of here.
That's ridiculous.

07:26.497 --> 07:29.458
Manny, this is the world our baby's
gonna grow up in.

07:29.584 --> 07:30.751
You can't change that.

07:30.876 --> 07:34.130
Of course I can.
I'm the biggest thing on Earth!

07:34.255 --> 07:38.718
Okay, Big Daddy. I can't wait to see
how you handle the teen years.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.974
Come on, Sid!
I don't want you touching anything.

07:45.099 --> 07:47.977
This place is for kids. Are you a kid?

07:48.561 --> 07:50.353
Don't answer that.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.326
Diego! There you are.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.869
You missed the big surprise!

08:05.994 --> 08:08.872
Right. Right. I'll check it out later.

08:08.997 --> 08:10.540
Okay. See you.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.002
You know, I think there's
something bothering Diego.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.004
No, I'm sure everything's fine.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.214
You should talk to him.

08:17.339 --> 08:20.008
Guys don't talk to guys
about guy problems.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.969
We just punch each other
on the shoulders.

08:23.678 --> 08:25.013
That's stupid.

08:25.138 --> 08:29.184
To a girl. To a guy,
that's like six months of therapy.

08:30.769 --> 08:32.895
Okay, okay, I'm going.

08:37.107 --> 08:38.193
Hey.

08:41.905 --> 08:43.530
Why'd you do that?

08:43.990 --> 08:45.450
I don't know.

08:47.369 --> 08:48.787
So, listen,

08:49.412 --> 08:53.124
Ellie thinks there's
something bothering you. I told her...

08:53.250 --> 08:55.919
Actually, I've been thinking that soon

08:56.044 --> 08:58.713
it might be time for me to head out.

08:59.589 --> 09:03.385
Okay. So I'll just tell her that you're fine.
It was nothing.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.972
Look, who are we kidding, Manny?
I'm losing my edge.

09:07.097 --> 09:09.933
I'm not really built
for chaperoning play dates.

09:10.058 --> 09:11.393
What are you talking about?

09:11.518 --> 09:14.646
Having a family, that's huge,
and I'm happy for you,

09:14.771 --> 09:17.649
but that's your adventure, not mine.

09:18.441 --> 09:21.236
- So you don't want to be around my kid?
- No, no, no. That's...

09:21.361 --> 09:23.321
- You're taking this the wrong way.
- No, go.

09:23.446 --> 09:27.158
Go find some adventure,
Mr. Adventure Guy.

09:27.284 --> 09:31.788
Don't let my boring domestic life
hit you in the butt on the way out.

09:31.913 --> 09:35.750
Isn't Ellie supposed to be the one
with the hormonal imbalance?

09:35.875 --> 09:38.377
Manny, wait! No one has to leave.

09:39.962 --> 09:43.173
- So?
- That's why guys don't talk to guys.

09:43.299 --> 09:46.427
- Why? What happened?
- Diego's leaving.

09:50.306 --> 09:54.184
This should be the best time of our lives.
We're having a baby!

09:54.310 --> 09:56.645
No, Sid. They're having a baby.

09:57.646 --> 10:00.608
Yeah, but we're a herd, a family.

10:01.817 --> 10:05.446
Look, things have changed.
Manny has other priorities now.

10:06.488 --> 10:11.076
Face it, Sid. We had a great run,
but now it's time to move on.

10:12.620 --> 10:14.788
So it's just the two of us.

10:15.164 --> 10:17.625
No, Sid, it's not the two of us.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.128
Crash and Eddie are coming with us?

10:22.171 --> 10:23.631
Just Crash?

10:25.174 --> 10:26.592
Just Eddie?

10:28.677 --> 10:30.012
Bye, Sid.

10:42.191 --> 10:45.110
Okay, calm down. Calm down.

10:45.236 --> 10:49.740
I'm good at making friends.
I'll make my own herd. That's what I'll do.

10:49.865 --> 10:52.326
Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man...

11:02.670 --> 11:05.464
Well, at least you still got your looks.

11:16.850 --> 11:17.893
Great.

11:25.776 --> 11:28.861
Anybody here? Anyone?

11:49.048 --> 11:50.383
Hello?

11:57.724 --> 12:01.352
Poor guys. I know what it's like
to feel abandoned.

12:07.859 --> 12:10.737
Don't worry. You're not alone anymore.

12:43.478 --> 12:44.938
There you go.

12:51.444 --> 12:53.821
Okay, okay. I'm okay, I'm okay.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.955
Stay here. Stay here. And you,
you take care of your brother, now.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.623
Momma's gonna be right back.

13:03.748 --> 13:05.541
Momma's coming, baby!

13:12.674 --> 13:13.967
Gotcha!

13:17.344 --> 13:19.596
What did I just tell you kids?

14:26.705 --> 14:28.999
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

14:29.541 --> 14:31.126
Bad egg. Rotten egg!

14:31.251 --> 14:33.754
A heart attack you almost gave me!

14:34.087 --> 14:37.341
I'm sorry, darling.
It's just that I love you so much.

14:37.466 --> 14:40.552
Now, I want you to meet
your Uncle Manny and your Aunt Ellie.

14:40.677 --> 14:43.055
- Hi!
- Hello.

14:43.430 --> 14:47.226
I'd like to present Egbert, Shelly and Yoko.

14:47.643 --> 14:51.063
Sid, whatever you're doing, it's a bad idea.

14:51.980 --> 14:53.482
My kids will hear you!

14:53.607 --> 14:56.693
They're not your kids, Sid.
Take them back.

14:56.818 --> 14:59.238
- You're not meant to be a parent.
- Why not?

14:59.363 --> 15:01.865
First sign, stealing someone else's eggs.

15:01.990 --> 15:05.117
Second sign, one of them
almost became an omelet.

15:06.202 --> 15:09.038
Sid, someone's probably
worried sick looking for them.

15:09.163 --> 15:11.582
No. They were underground, in ice.

15:11.707 --> 15:15.419
If it wasn't for me, they'd be Eggsicles.

15:17.296 --> 15:19.549
Sid, I know what you're going through.

15:19.674 --> 15:21.926
You're gonna have a family, too, someday.

15:22.051 --> 15:25.638
You're gonna meet a nice girl
with low standards,

15:25.763 --> 15:28.891
no real options or sense of smell...

15:29.016 --> 15:30.351
What Manny means to say is...

15:30.476 --> 15:32.937
No, I get it. I'll take them back.

15:33.771 --> 15:38.025
You have your family,
and I'm better off alone, by myself.

15:39.819 --> 15:41.737
A fortress of solitude.

15:43.155 --> 15:44.782
In the ice

15:45.658 --> 15:47.076
forever!

15:47.785 --> 15:49.996
A lone, lonely loner!

15:50.997 --> 15:53.708
- That's a lot of aloneness.
- Precisely!

15:54.500 --> 15:58.629
- Sid, wait!
- No! No, it's okay. He'll bounce back.

15:59.005 --> 16:01.841
It's one of the advantages of being Sid.

16:11.350 --> 16:15.771
Why should I take you back? I love kids!

16:15.897 --> 16:19.108
I'm responsible, loving, nurturing.

16:20.401 --> 16:22.111
What do you think?

16:23.863 --> 16:25.823
I knew you would agree.

16:28.576 --> 16:31.954
Don't cry! Don't cry.

16:32.079 --> 16:33.748
I'll find a dry place.

16:37.710 --> 16:38.753
Okay.

16:40.087 --> 16:42.131
Here, let me just dry you off.

16:47.053 --> 16:50.097
I don't know.
Being a parent's a lot of work.

16:51.182 --> 16:53.017
Maybe I'm not ready.

18:30.780 --> 18:31.907
Momma!

18:32.032 --> 18:34.576
Momma! Momma! Momma!

18:38.288 --> 18:39.706
I'm a mommy.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.918
Where's Mommy?

18:46.170 --> 18:47.630
Here I am.

18:50.507 --> 18:52.968
There you go. Nice squeaky faces.

19:09.526 --> 19:11.320
I got it! I got it!

19:16.325 --> 19:19.495
No, no! Stop! Not me! No, stop, stop!

19:21.872 --> 19:23.457
Hey! No biting!

19:27.211 --> 19:30.923
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No. It's okay, it's okay. Don't cry.

19:31.048 --> 19:33.759
Why are you still crying? Are you hungry?

19:33.884 --> 19:36.887
Maybe you're hungry.
I know just the thing.

19:39.348 --> 19:43.686
Hush, hush
You mean, vicious animal

19:44.186 --> 19:48.857
I'm your baby and this is my milk

19:52.069 --> 19:54.530
I thought you were a female!

21:20.156 --> 21:24.661
I'm sorry, but you can't go in.
Manny says it's just for kids.

21:26.037 --> 21:28.248
Wait a minute. You are kids!

21:31.543 --> 21:33.753
Just don't break anything!

21:34.837 --> 21:37.465
The sloth says the playground's open!

21:38.883 --> 21:41.135
No, wait! Not for everyone!

21:46.266 --> 21:48.560
No, no, no! Don't touch that!

21:54.691 --> 21:57.819
- What are they?
- Who cares? They're fun!

21:57.944 --> 22:00.655
- Play nice!
- Mommy, he's not sharing!

22:00.780 --> 22:03.825
- Aren't you going to do something?
- Why? My kid had it first.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.285
- Did not!
- Did, too!

22:05.410 --> 22:06.744
- Did not!
- Did, too!

22:06.870 --> 22:09.664
- Did not!
- Liar, liar, fur on fire!

22:09.789 --> 22:11.332
What is the matter with you?

22:11.457 --> 22:15.670
I'm a single mother with three kids.
I could use a little compassion!

22:16.713 --> 22:18.256
Slow down! No!

22:18.381 --> 22:19.757
No, don't...

22:20.173 --> 22:21.800
Stop, stop, stop!

22:23.635 --> 22:26.096
- Ronald!
- That's a shame.

22:31.059 --> 22:33.186
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

22:34.062 --> 22:35.355
No! No!

22:37.566 --> 22:40.777
- Hold on, Little Johnny!
- I'm trying!

22:44.573 --> 22:48.493
You know, experts say you should
let the kids eat whatever they want!

22:49.369 --> 22:51.163
Do you think my ankles look fat?

22:51.288 --> 22:53.081
Ankles? What ankles?

22:57.586 --> 22:59.922
Ronald! Where did you come from?

23:02.341 --> 23:03.800
Oh, no.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.429
Okay, come on. Spit him out.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.431
If you don't spit out Little Johnny,

23:09.556 --> 23:11.850
we're leaving the playground this instant!

23:11.975 --> 23:13.143
One,

23:13.644 --> 23:14.937
two...

23:15.520 --> 23:17.814
Don't make me say "three"!

23:19.399 --> 23:22.069
There we are. A picture of health.

23:22.194 --> 23:24.655
- That's not Little Johnny.
- Well, better than nothing.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.740
Madison!

23:27.449 --> 23:30.077
- Come on, barf him up.
- Sid?

23:30.786 --> 23:32.871
Hey. Hey, Manny.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.457
Little Johnny!

23:39.294 --> 23:40.921
Wait! No, no...

23:43.674 --> 23:45.467
I'm really sorry.

23:51.974 --> 23:55.435
- This place is totaled.
- And we didn't wreck it.

23:55.561 --> 23:56.603
We're losing our touch, bro.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.646
We're losing our touch, bro.

23:58.814 --> 24:01.441
Well, the important thing is
that no one got hurt.

24:02.234 --> 24:03.527
Except for that guy.

24:03.819 --> 24:04.945
And those three.

24:06.196 --> 24:07.239
And her.

24:09.907 --> 24:13.160
I told you to take them back,
and you kept them!

24:13.286 --> 24:14.370
Now look what they've done!

24:14.495 --> 24:16.914
Okay, granted,
we do have some discipline issues.

24:17.039 --> 24:19.208
Eating kids is not a discipline issue!

24:19.333 --> 24:21.961
- But he spit them out.
- Well, that's super.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.964
Let's give him a gold star! Kid of the week!

24:25.423 --> 24:26.966
They don't belong here, Sid.

24:27.091 --> 24:30.928
Whatever they are,
wherever you found them, take them back.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.639
Manny! I'm not getting rid of my kids!

24:35.850 --> 24:37.476
Earthquake!

24:39.353 --> 24:42.148
It's okay, it's okay. Momma's here.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.527
Do earthquakes shriek?

25:15.139 --> 25:16.849
I thought those guys were extinct!

25:16.974 --> 25:20.519
Well, then that is one angry fossil. Sid!

25:21.854 --> 25:24.190
Come on, come on! Inside, inside, inside!

25:41.123 --> 25:44.043
Nobody move a muscle.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.993
No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.

26:20.787 --> 26:24.416
We are poor, little lambs
who have lost our way

26:37.637 --> 26:41.433
Sid! Give them to her! She's their mother!

26:41.558 --> 26:43.393
How do I know she's their mother?

26:43.518 --> 26:46.938
What do you want, a birth certificate?
She's a dinosaur!

26:47.063 --> 26:50.817
Well, I put in the blood, sweat and tears
to raise them!

26:50.942 --> 26:53.778
For a day! Give them back, you lunatic!

26:53.904 --> 26:56.198
Look, these are my kids,

26:57.199 --> 27:00.535
and you're gonna have to go through me
to get them!

27:06.082 --> 27:07.375
- Sid!
- Sid!

27:08.835 --> 27:10.128
Help!

27:16.509 --> 27:17.969
Run!

27:18.261 --> 27:20.555
Don't you have anything better to do?

27:25.143 --> 27:26.311
Sid?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.454
Sid must be down there.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.248
- Well, he's dead.
- Real shame.

27:47.373 --> 27:49.041
He will be missed.

27:49.625 --> 27:52.169
Oh, no, no, no. Not so fast.

27:52.294 --> 27:54.838
Okay, Ellie, this is where I draw the line.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.466
You, Crash and Eddie, back to the village.

27:57.591 --> 27:59.176
Yeah, that's gonna happen.

27:59.301 --> 28:03.138
Ellie, you saw that thing!
This is gonna be dangerous!

28:03.264 --> 28:04.598
Talk to the trunk.

28:04.723 --> 28:08.060
Great. After we save Sid,
I'm gonna kill him.

28:10.062 --> 28:12.231
- Ladies first.
- Age before beauty.

28:12.356 --> 28:14.525
- No pain, no gain.
- What pain?

28:25.536 --> 28:28.289
- Sid!
- Sid!

28:39.216 --> 28:43.220
Oh, no. No, no. Not good, not good.

28:45.389 --> 28:47.516
Ellie! Ellie, wait up!

28:50.769 --> 28:53.272
Okay, look, if you feel anything,

28:53.397 --> 28:56.775
even if it's nothing, you gotta tell me,
and then we're out of here.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.027
Okay.

28:58.485 --> 28:59.904
We need a code word!

29:00.029 --> 29:03.157
Yeah. Something that says,
"The baby's coming."

29:04.074 --> 29:07.870
How about, "The baby's coming!"
How's that?

29:08.621 --> 29:12.583
Too long. We need something
short and punchy, like...

29:12.708 --> 29:13.792
"Peaches!"

29:13.918 --> 29:16.253
- Peaches?
- I love peaches.

29:16.378 --> 29:20.424
They're sweet and round and fuzzy,
just like you.

29:20.549 --> 29:22.259
You think I'm round?

29:23.510 --> 29:26.722
Round is good. Round is foxy.

29:38.316 --> 29:39.651
Stay close.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.216
Are you guys
having the same dream I am?

30:03.341 --> 30:07.762
We've been living above an entire world,
and we didn't even know it.

30:31.286 --> 30:34.122
Run for it! Hurry!

30:41.087 --> 30:44.632
- Diego, what are you doing here?
- Sightseeing!

30:44.757 --> 30:48.011
- I'm looking for Sid, same as you.
- Well! Aren't you noble?

30:48.136 --> 30:52.015
This is not the time, guys!
We need all the help we can get!

31:02.817 --> 31:04.235
Never mind.

31:14.287 --> 31:17.749
Here, boy! Here! Come on!
Good boy! Come on!

31:18.458 --> 31:20.335
- Climb on.
- Are you nuts?

31:20.460 --> 31:21.669
We're not getting on that thing!

31:21.794 --> 31:24.422
It's either this dinosaur or that one!

31:27.633 --> 31:31.094
Pregnant lady wants to live!
Yabba-dabba-doo!

31:42.814 --> 31:45.817
Don't ever yabba-dabba do that again!

31:51.573 --> 31:56.161
- I feel so puny.
- How do you think I feel?

32:19.768 --> 32:21.311
Take cover!

33:09.818 --> 33:12.988
Dude, you're awesome!
You're like the brother I never had!

33:13.113 --> 33:14.447
Me, too!

33:27.335 --> 33:28.878
Can we keep him?

33:31.631 --> 33:33.090
- Buck!
- What?

33:33.341 --> 33:36.052
The name's Buck. Short for Buckminster.

33:37.261 --> 33:39.555
Long for "Buh."

33:41.933 --> 33:43.476
A little dull.

33:45.269 --> 33:46.938
What are you doing here?

33:47.063 --> 33:49.607
- Our friend was taken by a dinosaur.
- Well!

33:50.358 --> 33:54.403
He's dead. Welcome to my world.
Now go home.

33:54.737 --> 33:56.697
- Off you pop.
- Not without Sid.

33:56.822 --> 34:00.201
Ellie, wait.
Maybe the deranged hermit has a point.

34:00.326 --> 34:02.912
Manny, we came this far,
we're gonna find him.

34:03.037 --> 34:04.580
I got tracks.

34:06.999 --> 34:08.292
Let's go.

34:11.003 --> 34:13.214
If you go in there, you'll find your friend.

34:14.215 --> 34:16.007
In the afterlife.

34:16.509 --> 34:19.804
How do you know,
O Great and Wisely Weasely One?

34:28.103 --> 34:29.105
Yeah.

34:29.230 --> 34:34.025
Mommy dinosaur carrying her three babies
and some floppy green thing.

34:34.985 --> 34:37.405
Yeah, we're friends
with the floppy green thing.

34:37.530 --> 34:39.282
You got all that from the tracks?

34:39.407 --> 34:41.909
No. Not really.
I saw them come through here earlier.

34:42.034 --> 34:43.452
She's headed for Lava Falls.

34:44.911 --> 34:47.456
That's where they care for the newborns.

34:47.581 --> 34:51.793
To get there, you've got to go
through the Jungle of Misery,

34:51.918 --> 34:54.422
across the Chasm of Death

34:56.507 --> 34:58.968
to the Plates of Woe.

35:01.888 --> 35:05.932
Okay! Good luck with the slow
descent into madness.

35:06.057 --> 35:07.142
We're gonna go now.

35:10.937 --> 35:13.732
What, you think this is
some sort of tropical getaway?

35:14.357 --> 35:16.985
You can't protect your mate, mate.

35:17.569 --> 35:20.655
What are you gonna do
with those flimsy tusks

35:20.780 --> 35:23.158
when you run into the beast?

35:24.743 --> 35:26.286
I call him

35:26.786 --> 35:28.330
Rudy.

35:28.455 --> 35:32.167
Oh, good. Good. I was worried
it was something intimidating,

35:32.292 --> 35:35.003
like "Sheldon" or "Tim."

35:35.420 --> 35:38.924
Wait. You mean there's something
bigger than Mommy Dinosaur?

35:39.049 --> 35:40.425
- Aye.
- Eye?

35:40.842 --> 35:43.929
Aye, aye! He's the one that gave me this!

35:45.513 --> 35:49.601
- He gave you that patch?
- For free? That's so cool.

35:49.726 --> 35:52.187
Yeah. Maybe he'll give us one, too.

35:56.483 --> 35:58.235
Welcome to my world.

36:01.863 --> 36:04.741
Abandon all hope, he who enters there!

36:04.866 --> 36:06.826
All right! We get it!

36:06.952 --> 36:09.913
Doom and despair, yada, yada, yada.

37:23.611 --> 37:26.197
Sounds like a jungle of misery to me.

37:40.002 --> 37:43.422
- Hold on.
- Why? What's wrong? Peaches?

37:43.547 --> 37:47.801
What? No! It's just I got a funny feeling.

37:48.135 --> 37:51.472
You're hungry! Low blood sugar.
There's some fruit!

37:52.181 --> 37:55.142
- No! Manny!
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

37:55.809 --> 37:58.437
This isn't exactly your playground.

37:59.313 --> 38:01.899
Like I'm really gonna be afraid
of a pretty flower.

38:04.485 --> 38:06.195
Bet you didn't see that coming.

38:07.696 --> 38:10.658
- Manny!
- For the record, I blame you for this.

38:13.118 --> 38:15.454
Stop eating our friends, plant!

38:21.168 --> 38:23.504
That's it! I'm tearing it up from the roots!

38:23.629 --> 38:27.341
- Do that, and it will clamp shut forever.
- What?

38:27.466 --> 38:30.010
All right, preggers,
don't get your trunk in a knot.

38:30.135 --> 38:31.804
I'll have them out of there
before they're digested.

38:31.929 --> 38:33.180
Digested?

38:33.847 --> 38:35.683
They'll be nothing but bones
in three minutes.

38:35.808 --> 38:37.226
Well, maybe five for the fat one.

38:37.351 --> 38:38.978
I'm not fat!

38:40.562 --> 38:41.855
I feel tingly.

38:41.980 --> 38:44.023
Don't say that
when you're pressed up against me.

38:44.148 --> 38:46.067
Not that kind of tingly.

38:46.359 --> 38:48.194
I can feel it, too.

38:50.071 --> 38:51.990
Help! Someone help us!

38:52.282 --> 38:53.324
Hurry!

38:53.449 --> 38:55.201
It's time to get

38:55.535 --> 38:57.036
Buck Wild.

39:06.379 --> 39:08.006
Who's fat now?

39:31.696 --> 39:32.947
No!

40:13.655 --> 40:14.822
Tourists.

40:14.948 --> 40:16.950
Barfed on by a plant.

40:17.325 --> 40:18.618
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

40:19.327 --> 40:20.954
Say something.

40:22.497 --> 40:24.457
Thanks for saving us.

40:24.874 --> 40:27.794
Buck, will you help us find
the floppy green thing?

40:27.919 --> 40:30.504
- That's not necessary!
- Yes, it is.

40:32.839 --> 40:34.800
All right, I'll help you.

40:34.925 --> 40:36.385
But I got rules.

40:36.510 --> 40:39.763
Rule number one, always listen to Buck.

40:41.014 --> 40:44.268
Rule number two,
stay in the middle of the trail.

40:44.852 --> 40:46.478
Rule number three,

40:50.691 --> 40:53.777
he who has gas
travels at the back of the pack.

40:56.989 --> 40:59.157
Come on, then. Chop, chop!

40:59.575 --> 41:01.785
We should all have our heads examined.

41:01.910 --> 41:05.497
That's rule number four!
Now let's go find your friend!

41:26.977 --> 41:30.856
It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry.
We're gonna be fine.

41:30.981 --> 41:33.734
Please stop swaying. A little nauseous.

41:38.947 --> 41:41.992
See? She's putting us down...

41:44.578 --> 41:48.415
No! I'm too young to be eaten!

41:51.710 --> 41:54.922
Nice mucus.
And I don't say that to everyone.

42:08.602 --> 42:12.231
Listen, families get complicated!
Maybe we can work something out.

42:12.356 --> 42:14.441
I can take them Sunday to Tuesday!

42:14.566 --> 42:17.110
Wednesday to Friday? Weekends?

42:24.867 --> 42:27.620
It's okay! Momma's okay.

42:30.122 --> 42:32.917
If you eat me, it will send a bad message.

42:38.714 --> 42:40.758
Score one for the sloth!

42:46.055 --> 42:48.266
And the score's all tied up.

42:53.229 --> 42:55.273
Do you think the beast will find Sid?

42:55.398 --> 42:57.942
Or more importantly, us?

42:58.067 --> 42:59.986
Rudy? Are you joking?

43:00.403 --> 43:05.032
He's relentless.
He knows all, sees all, eats all.

43:06.492 --> 43:08.119
So that's a yes.

43:12.623 --> 43:15.585
Hey! Get off my lawn! Go on! Shoo!

43:21.173 --> 43:22.717
I knew that guy when he was a caterpillar.

43:22.842 --> 43:24.886
You know, before he came out.

43:27.096 --> 43:29.223
So you're just living down here
by your wits,

43:29.348 --> 43:31.809
all on your own, no responsibilities.

43:31.934 --> 43:35.521
Not a one. It's incredible.
No dependents, no limits.

43:36.189 --> 43:38.649
It's the greatest life
a single guy could have.

43:38.774 --> 43:41.569
Hear that? This is my kind of place.

43:41.694 --> 43:42.820
Hello?

43:42.945 --> 43:44.655
Yeah... No, look, I can't talk right now.

43:44.780 --> 43:46.949
Yeah. No, I'm trying to recover
a dead sloth.

43:47.074 --> 43:48.117
Yeah.

43:50.286 --> 43:51.829
No, they're following me!

43:51.954 --> 43:54.165
I know! They think I'm crazy.

43:54.749 --> 43:57.001
No... Okay, we're going
into the Chasm of Death.

43:57.126 --> 43:58.920
I'm... I'm going to lose you.

43:59.045 --> 44:00.213
Yeah, I love you, too.

44:00.338 --> 44:02.798
All right, good-bye. Good-bye! Good-bye.

44:02.924 --> 44:04.508
Okay! Follow me.

44:05.051 --> 44:07.135
That's you in three weeks.

44:25.237 --> 44:28.114
So, why do they call it
the Chasm of Death?

44:28.532 --> 44:32.869
Well, we tried "Big Smelly Crack,"
but that just made everybody giggle.

44:33.537 --> 44:35.163
Well, now what?

44:38.291 --> 44:39.543
Madame.

44:40.752 --> 44:42.212
She is not doing that!

44:43.588 --> 44:45.340
Rule number one.

44:48.843 --> 44:52.138
Come on, mammoth!
You're supposed to have a good memory.

44:52.264 --> 44:54.224
Always listen to Buck.

44:58.937 --> 45:02.732
Now, eyes forward, back straight, and...

45:02.858 --> 45:05.402
Oh, yes, breathe in the toxic fumes
and you'll probably die.

45:05.527 --> 45:06.611
Toxic fumes?

45:06.736 --> 45:10.240
- Just another day in paradise.
- Wait!

45:11.408 --> 45:13.410
Geronimo!

45:23.628 --> 45:26.798
- Ellie, you okay?
- You have to try this!

45:26.923 --> 45:30.552
All right, now pile on, everyone!
Couldn't be easier!

45:35.473 --> 45:36.892
Don't panic!

45:37.017 --> 45:39.561
Just some technical difficulties.

45:40.312 --> 45:42.314
Keep holding it in, boys!

45:45.817 --> 45:47.485
I can't take it anymore!

45:47.611 --> 45:49.237
He breathed it!

45:49.362 --> 45:51.281
And now I'm breathing it!

45:54.326 --> 45:56.452
Hey! We're not dead!

45:56.577 --> 45:58.078
You sound ridiculous!

45:58.204 --> 46:00.372
Me? You should hear you!

46:04.418 --> 46:07.296
All right, all right. And a one, and a two...

46:07.421 --> 46:09.965
Christmas, Christmas time is here

46:10.090 --> 46:12.134
Stop! Are you crazy?

46:14.512 --> 46:15.638
It's not poison.

46:22.353 --> 46:24.355
That is so disturbing!

46:26.774 --> 46:28.984
Stop laughing! All of you!

46:29.527 --> 46:31.820
"Stop laughing, all of you!"

46:34.365 --> 46:36.575
"What's rule number one?"

46:40.037 --> 46:42.331
They're just laughing.
What's so bad about that?

46:42.456 --> 46:44.375
They died laughing!

46:47.795 --> 46:49.255
Stop laughing!

46:49.713 --> 46:51.549
You know what's funny, though?

46:51.674 --> 46:54.009
We're trying to save Sid,

46:54.134 --> 46:56.262
and now we're all gonna die!

46:57.930 --> 47:01.600
- And I don't even like Sid!
- Who does? He's an idiot!

47:04.395 --> 47:08.190
Thanks for getting me into this mess.
It's the most fun I've had in years!

47:08.315 --> 47:12.444
Thank you for deserting the herd!
That was totally super!

47:19.618 --> 47:21.161
Stop that!

47:21.579 --> 47:24.290
Don't you see? We're all gonna die!

47:29.920 --> 47:32.047
We gotta do everything, huh?

47:39.096 --> 47:41.348
Sometimes I wet my bed!

47:41.473 --> 47:44.392
That's all right!
Sometimes I wet your bed!

47:56.946 --> 47:59.407
I'm not sure how much of that
you could hear.

47:59.532 --> 48:02.535
- I heard all of it.
- Right. Yeah.

48:03.036 --> 48:05.997
- You wet my bed?
- That was gas talk, dude.

48:06.748 --> 48:09.375
Well, better get moving.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.377
Aren't we forgetting something?

48:11.502 --> 48:13.755
Here, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!

48:15.173 --> 48:16.841
I'm so lonely.

48:35.068 --> 48:37.153
Okay. Here you go, guys.

48:45.453 --> 48:47.455
What? You're not gonna
eat your vegetables?

48:47.580 --> 48:51.376
How are you gonna become
big, strong dinosaurs?

48:55.838 --> 49:00.593
No. I've raised them vegetarian.
It's a healthier lifestyle.

49:00.718 --> 49:04.222
I mean, look at me.
I have the pelt of a much younger sloth.

49:05.348 --> 49:08.977
Excuse me!
I'm trying to have a conversation here.

49:15.483 --> 49:17.861
No, no, no. That's not for us, kids.

49:17.986 --> 49:20.738
It's way too feathery and fleshy and...

49:21.656 --> 49:23.116
And alive!

49:30.540 --> 49:35.252
No! No, no, we do not eat
live animals, period!

49:36.086 --> 49:38.005
Now, go! Fly!

49:38.130 --> 49:39.715
Be free,

49:41.800 --> 49:44.094
little flightless bird.

49:46.763 --> 49:48.015
My bad.

49:48.891 --> 49:50.976
Hey, where are you going?

49:51.101 --> 49:53.270
This is how you resolve conflict?

49:53.395 --> 49:55.397
No wonder you're single!

49:59.776 --> 50:02.029
Come on. Am I talking to myself here?

50:02.154 --> 50:04.698
I say, "They're vegetarian."
You say, "Grrr."

50:04.823 --> 50:07.284
I say, "Can we talk about talk this?"
You say, "Grrr."

50:07.409 --> 50:09.620
I don't call that communication.

50:09.745 --> 50:12.456
See? That's your answer to everything.

50:25.302 --> 50:28.263
What are you afraid of?
You're the biggest thing on Earth!

50:32.643 --> 50:34.102
Aren't you?

50:37.564 --> 50:38.649
Hey!

50:47.115 --> 50:49.952
They'll never survive.
It's dangerous by day.

50:50.077 --> 50:51.828
But it's even worse at night.

50:51.954 --> 50:54.164
Plus, their guide is a lunatic.

50:54.289 --> 50:56.583
What? You mean, Buck? He's wacko!

50:56.708 --> 50:57.751
I am not!

50:57.876 --> 50:58.919
Totally bonkers.

50:59.044 --> 51:00.170
And his feet smell.

51:00.295 --> 51:01.588
Shut up! You shut up.

51:01.713 --> 51:03.382
Oh, you little...

51:03.507 --> 51:04.716
Gotcha!

51:05.008 --> 51:06.885
He's strangling his own foot.

51:07.010 --> 51:09.304
- Shouldn't we get moving?
- What?

51:09.513 --> 51:12.266
And give Rudy a midnight snack?
Not likely!

51:12.391 --> 51:14.309
The skull's right.
Take a load off, mammals.

51:14.434 --> 51:15.811
We'll camp here.

51:15.936 --> 51:17.396
Now, who's hungry?

51:17.521 --> 51:18.522
I am!

51:18.647 --> 51:20.858
You don't need the calories!

51:25.528 --> 51:30.241
There I was, my back against the wall,
no way out,

51:31.576 --> 51:34.620
perched on the razor's edge of oblivion,

51:34.996 --> 51:39.333
staring into the eye
of the Great White Beast.

52:41.229 --> 52:44.106
- Were you killed?
- Sadly, yes.

52:44.232 --> 52:45.358
But I lived!

52:48.569 --> 52:52.865
Never had I felt so alive
than when I was so close to death.

52:53.908 --> 52:56.202
Just before Rudy could suck me
down his gullet,

52:56.327 --> 52:58.412
I grabbed hold of that gross,
pink, fleshy thing

52:58.538 --> 53:00.331
that dangles at the back of the throat.

53:01.457 --> 53:04.877
I hung onto that sucker, and I swung
back and forth,

53:05.044 --> 53:09.882
and back and forth, and back and forth,
and back and forth, and back

53:11.049 --> 53:12.968
and forth, and back and forth,

53:13.093 --> 53:16.721
until finally, I let go
and I shot right out of his mouth!

53:18.431 --> 53:22.102
I may have lost an eye that day,
but I got this!

53:23.144 --> 53:25.313
- Rudy's tooth!
- Dang!

53:25.981 --> 53:28.275
It's like the old saying, "An eye for a tooth,

53:28.400 --> 53:31.570
"a nose for a chin, a butt for a..."

53:32.654 --> 53:35.532
Well, it's an old saying,
but it's not a very good one.

53:35.657 --> 53:38.785
- You are Super Weasel!
- Ultra-Weasel!

53:38.910 --> 53:40.453
Diesel Weasel!

53:45.292 --> 53:46.793
What? He is.

53:47.127 --> 53:50.046
Now let me tell you about the time
I used a sharpened clam shell

53:50.172 --> 53:52.591
to turn a T-Rex into a T-Rachel.

53:53.008 --> 53:54.426
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

53:55.302 --> 53:57.596
That's enough fairy tales for one night.

53:57.721 --> 54:00.265
Come on, Ellie, you should rest now.

54:01.224 --> 54:02.392
Life of the party.

54:02.517 --> 54:05.228
All right, you guys get some shut-eye.
I'll keep watch.

54:05.353 --> 54:09.733
Don't worry, Buck. We got this.
Night time is possum time.

54:09.858 --> 54:12.152
Yeah! We own the night, baby.

54:26.708 --> 54:28.376
Good night, Rudy.

54:40.764 --> 54:42.891
Wait, wait. What about me?

54:58.031 --> 55:01.116
Sleep well, kids!
We have a busy day tomorrow.

55:01.575 --> 55:03.577
Foraging, hunting,

55:05.704 --> 55:07.623
missing my friends,

55:08.165 --> 55:10.668
who probably aren't missing me.

55:24.890 --> 55:26.976
You're a real softie, you know that?

55:50.833 --> 55:51.959
Manny?

55:56.714 --> 55:59.466
Crash? Eddie?

56:03.512 --> 56:04.805
Manny?

56:23.616 --> 56:26.118
What's going on? Are you okay?

56:27.620 --> 56:30.164
I'm sorry. I just wanted to keep you safe,

56:30.289 --> 56:33.626
and now you're in the most dangerous
place in the world.

56:33.751 --> 56:36.045
Hey. This isn't your fault.

56:36.170 --> 56:39.507
It's bigger than both of us.
We have to get Sid.

56:40.132 --> 56:43.177
Yeah, but if I had been
a better friend to him,

56:43.636 --> 56:46.096
- we wouldn't be here.
- Better friend?

56:46.347 --> 56:48.516
Are you plucking my whiskers?

56:48.641 --> 56:52.852
You risked your life, your mate
and your baby to save your buddy.

56:54.145 --> 56:57.607
Not the best husband or father,
but a darn good friend!

57:05.198 --> 57:06.324
Hey!

58:16.895 --> 58:18.521
Everybody, stop!

58:20.273 --> 58:21.983
I smell something.

58:27.155 --> 58:29.991
It smells like a buzzard's butt fell off

58:30.742 --> 58:33.369
and then got sprayed on
by a bunch of skunks.

58:33.494 --> 58:34.621
That's Sid.

58:34.746 --> 58:38.040
Mammals, we have ourselves
a crime scene.

58:38.624 --> 58:41.793
A tuft of fur. Half-eaten carcass!

58:42.461 --> 58:44.838
Hunk of... No!

58:45.297 --> 58:46.590
Broccoli.

58:47.549 --> 58:48.717
Here's what I think happened.

58:49.218 --> 58:50.344
Dinosaur attacks Sid,

58:50.469 --> 58:54.264
Sid fights back with piece of broccoli,
leaving dinosaur

58:55.599 --> 58:56.725
a vegetable.

58:56.850 --> 58:59.978
Are you nuts? Sid's not violent.
Or coordinated.

59:00.354 --> 59:02.397
Yeah. And where's the dinosaur?

59:02.523 --> 59:04.858
All right. All right, good point.

59:04.983 --> 59:06.193
Theory two.

59:06.318 --> 59:07.528
Sid's eating broccoli,

59:07.653 --> 59:08.946
dinosaur eats Sid,

59:09.071 --> 59:11.823
dinosaur steps on broccoli,
leaving broccoli

59:12.574 --> 59:13.825
a vegetable.

59:13.951 --> 59:16.203
Buck, when exactly
did you lose your mind?

59:17.079 --> 59:18.080
Three months ago.

59:18.205 --> 59:20.874
I woke up one morning
married to a pineapple.

59:20.999 --> 59:22.209
An ugly pineapple.

59:24.211 --> 59:25.546
But I loved her.

59:25.671 --> 59:28.882
Buck, I think you missed
a little clue over here.

59:30.259 --> 59:33.929
Well, your friend might be alive,
but not for long.

59:35.556 --> 59:37.224
Rudy's closing in.

59:38.267 --> 59:39.309
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

59:39.434 --> 59:42.896
You got it. The Plates of Woe.

59:43.355 --> 59:45.065
Or whatever's left of them.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.929
Single file, everyone! Head for Lava Falls.

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:15.696
- What's that sound?
- It's the wind. It's speaking to us.

01:01:16.322 --> 01:01:18.491
- What's it saying?
- I don't know.

01:01:18.616 --> 01:01:20.076
I don't speak Wind.

01:01:29.126 --> 01:01:32.463
- Ellie!
- I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.173
I'm just taking my...

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.219
Ellie!

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:43.015
- Manny!
- Get to the ledge!

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:01.158
Ellie!

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.412
Ellie! Where are you?

01:02:04.745 --> 01:02:07.123
It's okay! I'm up here!

01:02:07.498 --> 01:02:10.251
Hang on, Ellie! We'll be right there!

01:02:32.606 --> 01:02:34.816
Wait! Sloth down!

01:02:37.068 --> 01:02:39.654
Wait. Wait. Time out!

01:02:40.572 --> 01:02:44.451
Hold up. You guys are getting fast!

01:02:48.872 --> 01:02:52.751
It's not so bad down here.
Nice weather, friendly neighbors.

01:02:59.966 --> 01:03:01.468
Hi, neighbor.

01:03:04.804 --> 01:03:06.556
- Rudy.
- Rudy?

01:03:08.475 --> 01:03:11.102
- Never heard that kind of dino before.
- That's Sid!

01:03:11.561 --> 01:03:14.940
- We'll have to move fast.
- Manny! Pineapples!

01:03:15.482 --> 01:03:17.609
- Pineapples?
- She gets cravings.

01:03:17.734 --> 01:03:20.946
Pomegranates? Grapefruits! Nectarines?

01:03:21.071 --> 01:03:22.822
She's ordering a fruit cocktail.

01:03:22.989 --> 01:03:24.616
Come on, think!

01:03:25.575 --> 01:03:26.910
Peaches!

01:03:27.786 --> 01:03:29.079
Peaches?

01:03:29.746 --> 01:03:32.666
Peaches! The baby! What, now?

01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:34.584
This? Not good.

01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:36.086
The baby's coming!
Did you guys hear that?

01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:37.754
'Cause sometimes
I imagine it in my head, but...

01:03:37.879 --> 01:03:39.548
Can you try to hold it in?

01:03:39.673 --> 01:03:41.716
Can somebody slap him for me?

01:03:42.676 --> 01:03:44.135
Done and done.

01:03:44.511 --> 01:03:46.137
Just sit tight. We're coming!

01:03:46.263 --> 01:03:48.765
There's only one thing to do.
Possums, you're with me.

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:51.184
Manny, you take care of Ellie
until we get back.

01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:52.936
What? No, you can't leave now!

01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:55.397
She's off the trail!
What about rule number two?

01:03:55.522 --> 01:03:58.066
Rule number five says
you can ignore rule number two

01:03:58.191 --> 01:04:01.403
if there's a female involved,
or possibly a cute dog.

01:04:01.528 --> 01:04:03.446
You know I just make up these rules
as I go along.

01:04:03.572 --> 01:04:07.449
- Yeah, but, but she's... You have to...
- Manny, it's all right.

01:04:08.117 --> 01:04:09.785
I got your back.

01:04:11.495 --> 01:04:14.165
Now you're talking! Come on, lads.

01:04:16.792 --> 01:04:20.754
- Take care of our sister, mister.
- No pressure.

01:04:21.463 --> 01:04:23.132
What does that mean, "I got your back"?

01:04:23.257 --> 01:04:24.675
I mean, I'd rather they covered the front.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.343
That's where all the good stuff is, isn't it?

01:04:26.468 --> 01:04:28.137
We gotta move.

01:04:32.808 --> 01:04:35.102
Okay. All right. It's okay.

01:04:35.978 --> 01:04:38.105
Daddy's... Daddy's coming.

01:04:38.731 --> 01:04:41.775
I gotta say, sweetheart,
you really got timing.

01:05:02.171 --> 01:05:06.509
Go away! Go away!
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

01:05:19.188 --> 01:05:21.774
Don't worry. It's just lava.

01:05:22.942 --> 01:05:25.569
Deadly boiling lava!

01:05:41.293 --> 01:05:44.421
- Boys, are you ready for adventure?
- Yes, sir!

01:05:44.547 --> 01:05:46.423
- For danger?
- Yes, sir!

01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:47.925
For death?

01:05:48.634 --> 01:05:49.885
Can you repeat the question?

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:51.262
Jump!

01:06:02.105 --> 01:06:02.689
That's right! Come on!

01:06:02.689 --> 01:06:04.107
That's right! Come on!

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.611
Have you ever flown one of these before?

01:06:08.736 --> 01:06:10.822
No! First time, actually.

01:06:19.038 --> 01:06:21.124
- There she is!
- Ellie!

01:06:21.249 --> 01:06:22.458
Manny!

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:28.464
I need to get to her!

01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:30.466
Listen. I'll protect Ellie.

01:06:30.592 --> 01:06:32.135
- You stop those guys.
- But...

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.514
Manny, if they reach her, it'll be too late.
You have to trust me.

01:06:40.185 --> 01:06:42.145
All right. Let's do it.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.226
My paws are burning, baby!
They're burning!

01:07:21.351 --> 01:07:23.353
I got to tip-toe.
Tippy-toe. Tippy-toe.

01:07:23.478 --> 01:07:26.648
Excuse me, twinkle toes!
Giving birth here.

01:07:27.106 --> 01:07:30.026
Right. Sorry. You okay?

01:07:30.276 --> 01:07:33.530
Am I okay?
Do you know anything about childbirth?

01:07:33.655 --> 01:07:35.990
No, not really, but Manny's coming.

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:46.792
Diego, I'm scared. Can I hold your paw?

01:07:46.917 --> 01:07:48.877
Yeah, of course.

01:07:49.002 --> 01:07:50.838
Just go with the pain.

01:07:52.089 --> 01:07:54.341
- It's just a contraction.
- No!

01:08:07.187 --> 01:08:09.064
Look! He's right there!

01:08:09.189 --> 01:08:11.191
- Roger!
- No! Sid!

01:08:11.316 --> 01:08:12.818
I know! Roger!

01:08:12.943 --> 01:08:15.779
How about we get Sid first
and then go back for Roger?

01:08:16.529 --> 01:08:17.656
Never mind!

01:08:29.792 --> 01:08:31.086
Buck?

01:08:46.894 --> 01:08:50.522
No, no, Buck! Buck, wait! Sid's that way!

01:08:50.647 --> 01:08:52.441
Tell that to them!

01:08:54.234 --> 01:08:56.987
Bring it on, you chicken-headed freaks!

01:09:14.755 --> 01:09:17.716
Don't worry about a thing.
You're doing fine.

01:09:19.176 --> 01:09:20.844
It's going great.

01:09:21.678 --> 01:09:22.970
Excuse me.

01:09:26.058 --> 01:09:27.809
Just keep breathing!

01:09:28.143 --> 01:09:29.228
Diego!

01:09:29.353 --> 01:09:32.145
Just breathe! That's the important thing.

01:09:40.238 --> 01:09:41.863
Grab that ammo!

01:09:45.785 --> 01:09:47.745
Bogey, three o'clock! Fire!

01:09:56.462 --> 01:09:59.507
This is awesome!

01:10:02.885 --> 01:10:04.345
Light it up!

01:10:05.555 --> 01:10:07.682
- Yeah!
- Hasta la vista, birdy!

01:10:20.153 --> 01:10:21.946
Let's get our sloth!

01:10:22.071 --> 01:10:25.199
We're hit! We're hit! Mayday! Mayday!

01:10:25.324 --> 01:10:28.911
We're losing altitude! Hold these!

01:10:32.039 --> 01:10:33.624
Tastes like fish.

01:10:33.749 --> 01:10:35.877
Okay. That's just weird.

01:10:37.545 --> 01:10:40.464
- I love you, bro!
- I know!

01:10:41.174 --> 01:10:43.176
Snap out of it! Come on!

01:10:44.051 --> 01:10:45.261
Pull!

01:10:54.061 --> 01:10:57.690
This is the end of Sid the Sloth!

01:11:05.239 --> 01:11:07.492
- Help!
- No, Sid! It's me!

01:11:07.617 --> 01:11:09.368
- And me!
- And me!

01:11:09.494 --> 01:11:12.538
I don't want to panic anybody,
but who's flying this thing?

01:11:12.663 --> 01:11:13.664
Oops!

01:11:26.593 --> 01:11:28.678
No, no, wait! Wait! My kids!

01:11:32.098 --> 01:11:34.559
I never even got to say good-bye.

01:11:37.979 --> 01:11:40.690
You can do it! Push! Push!

01:11:40.815 --> 01:11:42.359
I can't do it!

01:11:42.484 --> 01:11:44.319
Just one more big push!

01:11:44.444 --> 01:11:47.239
You have no idea what I'm going through!

01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:50.909
Okay, forget I said that.
Let's do this together.

01:12:01.127 --> 01:12:03.630
I liked you guys better
when you were extinct.

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:10.262
Getting dizzy.

01:12:12.055 --> 01:12:15.934
Manny! Come on, buddy.
I think we're getting close.

01:12:51.178 --> 01:12:52.804
She's perfect.

01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:56.600
I think we should call her Ellie.

01:12:58.518 --> 01:12:59.853
Little Ellie.

01:12:59.978 --> 01:13:02.230
I got a better name. Peaches.

01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:04.524
Peaches?

01:13:04.649 --> 01:13:09.612
Why not? She's sweet and round
and covered with fuzz.

01:13:10.321 --> 01:13:11.614
Peaches.

01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:13.782
I love it.

01:13:17.328 --> 01:13:18.746
I saw that, tough guy.

01:13:18.871 --> 01:13:22.082
No, no. That last dino
caught my eye with a claw, and...

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:24.585
All right, so I'm not made of stone.

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:26.295
Incoming!

01:13:28.172 --> 01:13:29.507
It's Sid!

01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:36.847
- It's a boy!
- That's its tail.

01:13:36.972 --> 01:13:38.349
It's a girl!

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:43.854
Hi, sweetheart. Hello, hello!
It's Uncle Sid. Yes, it is.

01:13:43.979 --> 01:13:48.192
You're so beautiful. She is!
She looks just like her mother.

01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:50.402
Thank goodness.

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.406
No offense, Manny! No offense.
You're beautiful on the inside!

01:13:54.532 --> 01:13:56.242
It's good to have you back, Sid.

01:13:56.367 --> 01:13:59.995
Never thought I would say this,
but I missed you, buddy.

01:14:04.416 --> 01:14:06.710
Now I wish my kids were here.

01:14:07.086 --> 01:14:09.255
You could have been friends.

01:14:10.464 --> 01:14:11.590
Ellie!

01:14:15.427 --> 01:14:17.805
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:19.139
I didn't.

01:14:24.728 --> 01:14:27.606
I forgot what it was like
to be part of a family.

01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:30.276
What about you?
Ever thought about having kids?

01:14:34.071 --> 01:14:36.949
All right, mammals, let's get you home.

01:16:04.035 --> 01:16:07.539
This is it, mammals.
Right where you started.

01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:10.917
This was fun!
We could make it a regular thing.

01:16:12.043 --> 01:16:13.545
I don't know about that.

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:18.007
Right! Right. Yes, because of
all the mortal peril, of course.

01:16:19.259 --> 01:16:21.302
Well, the Buck stops here.

01:16:22.512 --> 01:16:24.389
We couldn't have done it without you.

01:16:24.514 --> 01:16:27.517
Well, obviously. But good times, just the...

01:16:29.143 --> 01:16:31.187
We're not alone, are we?

01:16:35.525 --> 01:16:36.860
Hello, Rudy.

01:16:45.994 --> 01:16:47.202
Run!

01:16:54.293 --> 01:16:56.753
Over here, you colossal fossil!

01:16:57.254 --> 01:16:59.214
Looking for something?

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:02.593
Why don't you come and get it!

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:04.428
To the cave! Go!

01:17:07.848 --> 01:17:10.642
- Stay with the baby.
- We'll be fine. Go.

01:17:18.275 --> 01:17:19.485
Wuss.

01:17:32.039 --> 01:17:33.832
Pop goes the weasel!

01:17:46.136 --> 01:17:47.804
Come on! Move!

01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:53.435
- Diego! Catch!
- Got it!

01:18:03.487 --> 01:18:06.031
Through the hole, over the valley.
One more loop...

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.617
Come on, lads! Heave!

01:18:23.674 --> 01:18:25.634
Better luck next time, snowflake.

01:18:25.759 --> 01:18:27.886
This isn't going to hold him long! Let's go!

01:18:28.011 --> 01:18:29.638
Hold up, guys!

01:18:52.201 --> 01:18:54.162
Way to go, Momzilla!

01:19:26.235 --> 01:19:28.988
Come here, kids.
Well, let me tell you something.

01:19:29.113 --> 01:19:31.032
You're where you belong now.

01:19:31.157 --> 01:19:35.244
And I'm sure you're going to grow up
to be giant, horrifying dinosaurs

01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:37.705
just like your mother.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.876
And Momma,

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:45.338
take good care of our kids.

01:20:13.533 --> 01:20:16.619
- You were a good parent, Sid.
- Thanks.

01:20:17.578 --> 01:20:19.455
- Can I baby-sit for you?
- Not a chance.

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:22.875
- Come on. I work cheap!
- All right, I'll think about it.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.168
Yes!

01:20:25.293 --> 01:20:26.753
Never happen.

01:20:30.674 --> 01:20:33.802
He's gone. What am I supposed to do now?

01:20:34.219 --> 01:20:36.847
That's easy. Come with us.

01:20:38.265 --> 01:20:40.267
You mean up there?

01:20:42.435 --> 01:20:44.312
I never thought of going back.

01:20:44.437 --> 01:20:47.649
I've been down here so long,
it feels like up to me.

01:20:47.774 --> 01:20:49.860
I'm not sure I can fit in up there anymore.

01:20:49.985 --> 01:20:53.947
So? Look at us.
We look like a normal herd to you?

01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:24.936
So long, big guy.

01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:39.201
That's our cue! Come on, Peaches.

01:21:40.744 --> 01:21:42.162
He's alive!

01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:45.040
Buck?

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:48.126
I... I got to...

01:21:49.419 --> 01:21:50.504
Yeah.

01:21:50.754 --> 01:21:54.174
Besides, this world should
really stay down here.

01:21:56.092 --> 01:21:58.094
Take care of them, Tiger.

01:21:58.345 --> 01:22:00.347
"Always listen to Buck."

01:22:01.264 --> 01:22:03.058
We're almost out!

01:22:09.898 --> 01:22:11.191
Rudy!

01:22:33.087 --> 01:22:34.797
Is everybody okay?

01:22:35.339 --> 01:22:36.882
Where's Buck?

01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:42.596
Don't worry. He's where he wants to be.

01:22:43.931 --> 01:22:46.725
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Are you kidding?

01:22:46.851 --> 01:22:50.729
Nothing could kill that weasel.
It's Rudy I'm worried about.

01:23:02.074 --> 01:23:05.327
I know this "baby makes three" thing
isn't for you,

01:23:05.452 --> 01:23:08.622
but whatever you decide to do...

01:23:08.747 --> 01:23:10.499
I'm not leaving, buddy.

01:23:10.624 --> 01:23:13.127
Life of adventure? It's right here.

01:23:13.544 --> 01:23:17.047
But I got a whole speech here.
I've been working on it.

01:23:17.173 --> 01:23:20.593
How can I show you
that I'm strong and sensitive?

01:23:20.718 --> 01:23:22.344
Noble yet caring?

01:23:24.513 --> 01:23:25.723
Thanks.

01:23:40.779 --> 01:23:42.740
They grow so fast, huh?

01:23:42.865 --> 01:23:44.492
Yeah. I mean, look at my kids.

01:23:44.617 --> 01:23:47.328
Seems like they were born one day
and then gone the next.

01:23:47.453 --> 01:23:48.954
They were, Sid.

01:23:49.079 --> 01:23:51.415
Yeah. That was a lot of work.

01:24:03.301 --> 01:24:06.846
That's right, sweetheart.
