WEBVTT

00:08.041 --> 00:11.471
Repeating what we know. Ms Reese has just
been arraigned of attempted murder charges.

00:11.471 --> 00:13.357
Bail was set at $1,200,000.

00:13.392 --> 00:14.112
Denny Crane.

00:14.133 --> 00:14.793
Barry Goal.

00:14.804 --> 00:16.576
Star of the popular
reality shows “The Phoenix,”

00:16.576 --> 00:17.942
entered a plea of not guilty.

00:17.942 --> 00:18.544
Denny Crane.

00:18.544 --> 00:19.076
Barry Goal.

00:19.076 --> 00:21.207
Both sides agreeing to
an immediate trial date.

00:21.207 --> 00:24.147
Why Ms Reese was carrying the gun,
we don't know.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.274
I thought he was gonna kill me.

00:26.274 --> 00:27.534
Did you recognize him?

00:27.534 --> 00:28.582
Well, not then.

00:28.583 --> 00:31.713
Now I know he's a photographer from
one of those celebrity stalker web sites.

00:31.713 --> 00:34.555
Fan-based web sites.
They track certain stars.

00:34.590 --> 00:37.712
Yeah, this one's called <i>getcourtney.com</i>.

00:39.169 --> 00:40.295
Denny Crane.

00:40.330 --> 00:41.421
Barry Goal.

00:41.511 --> 00:43.215
I'm sorry.
You'll have to forgive Denny.

00:43.215 --> 00:45.514
His eyes are bigger than
his shame, and frankly,

00:45.514 --> 00:47.614
I don't know what to make of Barry.

00:47.618 --> 00:51.526
So you said these web sites
actually track celebrities.

00:51.561 --> 00:52.747
They hunt us down.

00:52.748 --> 00:56.267
Anybody who spots me on the street just
text messages my location into the web site.

00:56.267 --> 00:58.018
Some of them even
get paid for a good tip.

00:58.018 --> 00:59.966
Now anybody… here.

01:00.001 --> 01:04.135
Anybody can track my every move,
every minute of the day.

01:04.908 --> 01:06.618
Terrible.

01:07.031 --> 01:08.787
Look at this.

01:08.822 --> 01:10.869
Oh, there's our building.
And it says you're here.

01:10.869 --> 01:11.960
And you're here.

01:11.995 --> 01:14.350
One of your assistants probably
just made 100 bucks for this tip.

01:14.350 --> 01:16.408
And the problem is, it's not
just fans who know where I am.

01:16.408 --> 01:18.599
It's stalkers… mentally ill people.

01:18.634 --> 01:21.008
I've had guys show up straight
from the psych ward to my door,

01:21.008 --> 01:23.978
saying I'm their ex-wife, and
they're gonna kill me for jilting them.

01:23.978 --> 01:26.641
And you thought this man
was coming to kill you?

01:26.641 --> 01:28.794
Yeah, I thought he…

01:28.829 --> 01:31.641
Mr Crane, I need you to
stop staring at me like that.

01:31.641 --> 01:33.947
Of course. Marry me.

01:33.982 --> 01:34.799
I beg your pardon?

01:34.799 --> 01:36.749
Your 15 minutes are almost up.

01:36.750 --> 01:40.523
Mine has lasted a lifetime. Tell her.

01:41.148 --> 01:43.543
Marry him.

01:50.128 --> 01:52.891
Lara and Joel Kohn to see
Marlene Stanger, 10:30.

01:52.891 --> 01:54.825
I think she stepped out of the building
for a few minutes.

01:54.825 --> 01:56.777
Let me try her cell.

01:58.047 --> 02:00.027
Are you here for Marlene Stanger?

02:00.042 --> 02:01.080
She was recommended to us.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.053
We made an appointment, but
she doesn't appear to be here.

02:04.053 --> 02:06.481
That doesn't sound like Marlene.

02:06.516 --> 02:09.887
I'm Denise Bauer. I work
very closely with Marlene,

02:09.922 --> 02:11.989
and I know that she is swamped.

02:12.024 --> 02:15.481
Um, why don't you come
in my office? We can talk.

02:20.775 --> 02:23.462
<i>Both sides have apparently
agreed to fast track this,</i>

02:23.462 --> 02:27.440
<i>the only issue being, did
 Ms Reese fear for her life, and if so,</i>

02:27.440 --> 02:29.097
<i>was that fear reasonable?</i>

02:29.097 --> 02:32.401
<i>Some speculation that Ms Reese was
simply fed up with the paparazzi,</i>

02:32.401 --> 02:34.750
<i>and this last encounter
was the final straw.</i>

02:34.750 --> 02:38.770
<i>So far, we have no indication of
where Ms Reese got the gun.</i>

02:38.804 --> 02:41.091
The good news, Courtney,
you're already beautiful,

02:41.091 --> 02:42.960
so we don't have to “Marcia Clark” you.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.588
The bad news is you're beautiful
and you shot a man.

02:45.588 --> 02:48.721
The only person I can see getting
away with that is Princess Die,

02:48.721 --> 02:51.855
who was herself killed
by the paparazzi.

02:51.890 --> 02:54.990
So by evoking her image,
we get a two-fer.

02:55.025 --> 02:58.035
I suggest this for
your first day of trial.

02:58.070 --> 03:00.625
A turtleneck in LA in the spring?

03:00.660 --> 03:01.776
Are you trying to kill me?

03:01.776 --> 03:03.898
We can mix and match,

03:03.899 --> 03:06.901
but it's critical you feel
comfortable in your wardrobe.

03:06.901 --> 03:08.694
The jury can sense comfort level.

03:08.694 --> 03:10.044
It's my own clothes or none at all.

03:10.044 --> 03:10.817
None.

03:10.818 --> 03:12.135
Courtney…

03:12.170 --> 03:14.581
Typically, we would want
the jury to relate to you.

03:14.581 --> 03:18.249
Typically, no juror would have been
carrying a gun into a restaurant,

03:18.249 --> 03:21.882
so perhaps the argument should be
they couldn't possibly relate to me.

03:21.882 --> 03:25.015
We'll get back to wardrobe,
let's talk victim.

03:25.050 --> 03:27.727
Our investigators are checking
into the photographer…

03:27.727 --> 03:30.265
his friends, family,
skeletons, the usual.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.768
What is important is that,
in the press,

03:32.803 --> 03:36.694
he looks like someone who
would attack Courtney in an alley.

03:36.729 --> 03:38.211
He did attack me in an alley.

03:38.211 --> 03:39.647
Legals?

03:39.648 --> 03:43.414
In order to prove self-defense, we need
to show that, in these circumstances,

03:43.414 --> 03:46.293
you reasonably felt
your life was in danger.

03:46.328 --> 03:49.949
The only person who can convey that
is you, so you'll need to testify.

03:49.949 --> 03:51.027
And I'll be right by your side.

03:51.027 --> 03:51.742
So will I.

03:51.743 --> 03:54.915
Neither of them will be.
You'll be sitting up there all alone,

03:54.915 --> 03:58.661
undoubtedly subject to
unrelenting cross-examination.

03:58.696 --> 03:59.654
I'm a big girl.

03:59.689 --> 04:01.269
Excellent.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.912
Now just for fun, try it
this way… I'm a bad girl.

04:03.912 --> 04:06.405
I just want to hear how it plays.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.527
I'm a bad girl.

04:07.562 --> 04:08.614
Very bad girl.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.992
Denny.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:20.142 --> 04:23.692
I can not believe you, of all people,
are here asking me for a favor.

04:23.692 --> 04:25.261
Well, it's not so much a favor as…

04:25.261 --> 04:27.113
Buzz Lightyear himself.

04:27.114 --> 04:28.040
Who calls me that?

04:28.040 --> 04:28.474
Not me.

04:28.509 --> 04:31.218
I look at you and see a Woody.

04:31.253 --> 04:32.458
She has no prison record.

04:32.458 --> 04:33.666
A boy is dead.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.498
Which is why we're willing to plead.
Three months is the right result.

04:36.498 --> 04:38.267
Whatever our differences, this is…

04:38.267 --> 04:39.966
Whoa, whoa, what… what differences?

04:39.966 --> 04:42.057
Are you referring to the time
I interviewed with you

04:42.057 --> 04:43.737
for a position at Crane, Poole & Schmidt,

04:43.737 --> 04:47.466
all the while, you surf the net to get
cheap ski lift tickets at Whistler?

04:47.466 --> 04:50.754
Do you think that that
would cause a rift between us?

04:50.789 --> 04:53.381
As if I'd even remember.

04:53.854 --> 04:56.048
I need your help.

04:56.611 --> 04:58.127
This is my niece.

04:58.162 --> 05:02.056
Now, you know this is
the right result. Please.

05:05.489 --> 05:09.272
On your knees.
And pretty please.

05:09.307 --> 05:10.618
What?

05:10.732 --> 05:12.707
Down on your knees. Do it.

05:12.742 --> 05:15.411
And… and button it with, um…

05:15.446 --> 05:18.203
beautiful goddess.

05:18.238 --> 05:19.778
You're not serious.

05:19.813 --> 05:21.319
I'm very serious.

05:32.347 --> 05:34.529
Pretty please.

05:37.258 --> 05:39.939
Beautiful… goddess.

06:04.107 --> 06:06.937
L.A. smog… not good.

06:13.401 --> 06:15.206
Denny…

06:16.204 --> 06:19.189
I consider myself a delightfully
lascivious person,

06:19.189 --> 06:21.768
and I often appreciate
that quality in others,

06:21.768 --> 06:25.281
but I need you to tone it
down a little with Courtney.

06:25.316 --> 06:27.534
She's the sexiest woman on earth.

06:27.569 --> 06:31.033
Unless, of course, you go for Pregos,
in which case, it's Angelina.

06:31.033 --> 06:34.462
This is a serious case, Denny.
She's up on attempted murder charges.

06:34.462 --> 06:37.462
It's a character builder.
She'll be fine.

06:37.497 --> 06:38.937
I'm gonna marry her, Alan.

06:38.937 --> 06:40.012
Courtney Reese?

06:40.013 --> 06:42.651
She's got Denny Crane
written all over her.

06:42.686 --> 06:45.324
And I'll tell you this,
when the time comes,

06:45.324 --> 06:47.934
she'll pull my plug…

06:47.969 --> 06:49.442
happily.

06:49.477 --> 06:52.776
Not to burst your bubble, as
unburstable as it appears to be,

06:52.776 --> 06:56.040
but I get the feeling Courtney's
interests lie elsewhere.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.147
What do you mean?

06:57.182 --> 06:59.807
I'm picking up on signals.

07:07.477 --> 07:09.343
Well, pick up on this…

07:09.378 --> 07:12.645
stay away from my sixth wife.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.114
Courtney Crane.

07:16.024 --> 07:18.362
I love it.

07:32.835 --> 07:34.934
Fish. Who knew?

07:34.969 --> 07:36.212
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

07:36.212 --> 07:37.949
Thank you.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.574
Everybody's smiling. Happy news?

07:41.609 --> 07:44.608
Denise just landed…
Dare I say it?

07:44.643 --> 07:46.075
A big whale.

07:46.110 --> 07:50.010
Citeradella Seafoods. They distribute
up and down the east coast.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.961
The Kohn family, right?

07:51.962 --> 07:53.343
Right.

07:54.327 --> 07:56.126
Huh.

08:08.041 --> 08:10.353
<i>The prosecution of Courtney Reese
for attempted murder begins…</i>

08:10.353 --> 08:11.523
Unbelievable.

08:11.558 --> 08:14.078
Wherever they go, they get the good stuff.

08:14.087 --> 08:16.130
Unbelievable.

08:16.922 --> 08:18.734
This isn't fair.

08:18.769 --> 08:20.466
<i>…a significant change in the works.</i>

08:20.466 --> 08:23.336
So I… I figured she might
come out the side alley.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.172
She often does. So I kinda
staked out a position.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.303
And at some point,
the defendant did come out?

08:28.303 --> 08:28.799
Yes.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.748
And what did you do?

08:29.748 --> 08:31.393
I approached to take a picture.

08:31.393 --> 08:32.519
Did you say anything?

08:32.519 --> 08:32.738
No.

08:32.739 --> 08:33.917
Did she say anything?

08:33.917 --> 08:35.974
Yeah, I think she yelled,
“back off.”

08:35.974 --> 08:37.542
And then what happened?

08:37.577 --> 08:39.111
I went to take a picture,

08:39.111 --> 08:41.494
and, uh… she shot me.

08:41.529 --> 08:44.294
Did she you warn you?
Did she indicate that she had a gun?

08:44.294 --> 08:47.462
No, no she just opened fire.

08:47.497 --> 08:49.972
It sounds like a terrifying encounter.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.557
Were you frightened, Mr Rice?

08:51.557 --> 08:52.841
Of course I was.

08:52.842 --> 08:54.296
I can imagine.

08:54.331 --> 08:57.740
By the way, can you imagine
that Ms Reese

08:57.775 --> 09:01.426
might have been terrified when
you charged at her in the alley?

09:01.426 --> 09:05.524
I think Ms Reese is familiar with
photographers trying to get her picture.

09:05.524 --> 09:07.607
You jumped out from behind
a dumpster, did you not?

09:07.607 --> 09:08.429
Yes.

09:08.430 --> 09:09.731
Was the alleyway lit?

09:09.766 --> 09:10.855
It was not lit.

09:10.856 --> 09:14.085
Mr Rice, you're a freelance
photographer, are you not?

09:14.085 --> 09:17.925
You submit your work to many
different magazines and newspapers?

09:17.936 --> 09:18.310
Yeah.

09:18.311 --> 09:21.819
And all these publications
prefer candid shots.

09:21.854 --> 09:24.535
A scared expression is worth more than

09:24.570 --> 09:27.880
say a picture where
a celebrity is smiling or posing.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.666
Which is why you leapt out from
behind the dumpster, to startle her?

09:30.666 --> 09:32.915
Yeah, I was trying to get
a candid shot of her, yes.

09:32.915 --> 09:35.197
But, again, they're used to that.

09:35.294 --> 09:39.131
By “they,” I imagine you mean
celebrities and other people who,

09:39.166 --> 09:43.004
at your discretion alone, have
forfeited their right to privacy.

09:43.004 --> 09:45.369
No, they signed up for it
when they chose to be famous.

09:45.369 --> 09:47.664
Did they sign up for having
their car run off the road?

09:47.664 --> 09:49.805
Because you've done that with
other celebrities, haven't you?

09:49.805 --> 09:51.600
Objection. The victim is not on trial here.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.181
The victim is very much on trial.

09:53.181 --> 09:54.957
He has three assault arrests…

09:54.992 --> 09:55.398
Objection.

09:55.398 --> 09:56.690
He's broken into houses…

09:56.690 --> 09:57.279
Objection.

09:57.279 --> 09:58.169
Spit at celebrities to provoke…

09:58.169 --> 09:59.086
Objection.

09:59.087 --> 10:00.491
The objections are sustained.

10:00.491 --> 10:02.988
This man's prior actions
are not relevant.

10:02.988 --> 10:07.305
But my client's state of mind is,
and many of the paparazzi,

10:07.340 --> 10:10.717
Mr Rice included, are criminals,
some very dangerous.

10:10.752 --> 10:14.823
Apparently, Filipino street gangs
have even got into the act. Why?

10:14.858 --> 10:15.614
Objection.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.275
Because ultimately, this is
about vast amounts of money.

10:18.275 --> 10:18.789
Objection.

10:18.789 --> 10:20.526
Sustained.

10:39.842 --> 10:42.224
I fired you! And I was as
expressly clear about that…

10:42.224 --> 10:43.180
As you are insane?

10:43.180 --> 10:43.875
My daughter!

10:43.875 --> 10:45.029
Who contributed to the death…

10:45.029 --> 10:45.354
No!

10:45.389 --> 10:45.680
Yes.

10:45.681 --> 10:47.254
How dare you go behind my back.

10:47.254 --> 10:48.758
It's Hannah's call, not yours.

10:48.758 --> 10:49.898
She's 16 years old.

10:49.904 --> 10:51.797
Exactly, she's got her
whole life ahead of her.

10:51.797 --> 10:53.596
Now three months is a good deal.

10:53.596 --> 10:55.516
She can serve it over the summer
and be back in time for school.

10:55.516 --> 10:56.869
As a convicted murderer?

10:56.869 --> 10:57.413
Manslaughter.

10:57.413 --> 10:57.888
Oh, my God.

10:57.888 --> 11:00.058
This is not about safeguarding
her college transcript.

11:00.058 --> 11:02.158
This is the best deal that
we could ever hope for.

11:02.158 --> 11:04.639
Now I got the DA to go along
with it, so for once in your life,

11:04.639 --> 11:06.679
just once, trust me.

11:06.714 --> 11:08.341
Oh, is that what this is all about?

11:08.341 --> 11:13.223
Getting me to finally trust you,
proving yourself to your big sister?

11:13.258 --> 11:16.373
At the risk of jeopardizing
our relationship any further,

11:16.373 --> 11:17.767
you got a frigging problem.

11:17.767 --> 11:20.189
For the past 16 years, your self-esteem
has been inextricably

11:20.189 --> 11:22.491
bound up with this idea
of having a perfect daughter.

11:22.491 --> 11:24.494
Well, she's not perfect.

11:24.529 --> 11:26.950
Her résumé, college transcript, and, yes,

11:26.950 --> 11:28.593
even her record,
they're all gonna be blemished.

11:28.593 --> 11:31.958
But this does not have
to destroy her life.

11:31.993 --> 11:37.594
If she takes this to trial, she could
go to jail for a year, maybe two.

11:37.629 --> 11:43.195
And you can't just wave your
magic wand to make this go away.

11:50.738 --> 11:54.030
Mario inadvertently found it
in the trash.

11:54.065 --> 11:54.950
Mario?

11:54.985 --> 11:56.354
Our night janitor.

11:56.355 --> 11:58.540
Really lovely gentleman. Helpful.

11:58.575 --> 12:01.744
I was so grateful when he found it
because I thought I'd misplaced it,

12:01.744 --> 12:04.068
but when I saw this…

12:05.719 --> 12:08.368
I was taking videos of my coworkers
to send to my family.

12:08.368 --> 12:09.735
I left it in the kitchen.

12:09.735 --> 12:14.320
I guess I accidentally left it on video
recording mode, and well, this happened.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.788
Oh, my.

12:15.823 --> 12:18.070
Maybe Denise thought she was playing
a practical joke,

12:18.070 --> 12:19.849
but I just don't think
it's all that funny.

12:19.849 --> 12:21.730
I mean, is that how the lawyers
treat each other here?

12:21.730 --> 12:23.830
Certainly not.

12:23.831 --> 12:26.494
I didn't think so, but somebody
should tell Denise,

12:26.494 --> 12:29.279
because she is full of little pranks.

12:29.314 --> 12:31.298
Other pranks?

12:31.618 --> 12:34.710
Again, I'm really so uncomfortable
with this,

12:34.745 --> 12:38.037
but I went out to greet my clients,
the Kohns, in the lobby the other day.

12:38.037 --> 12:39.836
Referrals from my old firm.

12:39.871 --> 12:43.309
I was late, I admit, as they were
scheduled in my personal calendar,

12:43.309 --> 12:45.366
but since it was in the trash…

12:45.401 --> 12:47.585
Anyway, I went out to get them,
and they were gone.

12:47.585 --> 12:50.427
It turns out Denise took them.

12:52.871 --> 12:55.141
Denise?

13:02.425 --> 13:07.657
You understand, Ms Guttman, that by
pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter,

13:07.692 --> 13:11.101
you stand convicted of a felony?

13:11.136 --> 13:12.645
Yes, sir.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.154
Very well.

13:14.313 --> 13:17.489
Ms Raines, the district attorney's office

13:17.524 --> 13:21.104
joins the recommendation of the defense
for three months at Rosenberg.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.512
We do, your honor.

13:22.547 --> 13:26.072
This is a very serious matter
involving the loss of a human life,

13:26.072 --> 13:28.378
but we are impressed
by the defendant's remorse.

13:28.378 --> 13:30.862
We're also mindful that she has
no previous criminal record,

13:30.862 --> 13:35.365
and we're satisfied that three months
constitutes a just punishment.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.648
Well… you might be satisfied,
but I'm not.

13:39.683 --> 13:43.283
See, I have to be cognizant not
only of the death of Ryan Klein,

13:43.283 --> 13:46.136
but also of the pandemic
of pharming drug parties

13:46.136 --> 13:48.919
going on in every town
all over this country,

13:48.954 --> 13:51.332
causing the loss of many lives.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.918
Three months is an insult to those lives.

13:53.953 --> 13:55.105
Your honor, this…

13:55.140 --> 13:56.258
I'm talking, counsel.

13:56.258 --> 13:59.887
The court rejects this and
will not entertain any plea

13:59.922 --> 14:03.516
which causes Ms Guttman
to serve less than three years.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.383
–What?
–Brad.

14:04.418 --> 14:05.789
I ask that your honor be recused.

14:05.789 --> 14:08.454
Denied. Now you want
to go to trial, fine.

14:08.489 --> 14:10.118
But you've got me,

14:10.153 --> 14:16.247
which means that I can impose
sentence now or later.

14:24.457 --> 14:28.498
I've received 17 death threats,
the latest coming 2 weeks ago.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.677
You received a death threat
just two weeks ago?

14:30.677 --> 14:34.604
Yes, I also get thousands of
letters from prison inmates,

14:34.639 --> 14:38.198
pledging their love and planning
to seek me out upon release.

14:38.198 --> 14:42.015
and I get many inappropriate, prurient
letters from people on the outside

14:42.015 --> 14:44.057
as well… sometimes doctors, lawyers.

14:44.057 --> 14:48.040
I've received three in the last day
from one of my own lawyers.

14:48.075 --> 14:52.023
You're clearly the object of a lot
of adoration and obsession.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.728
Which comes with celebrity
and fame, I realize,

14:54.728 --> 14:56.216
but this kind of fame…

14:56.251 --> 14:57.756
And… and add to that
the internet.

14:57.756 --> 14:59.867
What does the internet
have to do with this?

14:59.867 --> 15:03.572
With these celebrity stalker sites, everybody
can become a member of the paparazzi.

15:03.572 --> 15:06.783
I mean, they've all got cameras and
e-mail access with their cell phones.

15:06.783 --> 15:10.076
I go to the coffee shop for a latte,
it's instantly posted.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.174
It's become simple
to track my whereabouts.

15:13.209 --> 15:16.123
Obsessive people know
how to find me,

15:16.158 --> 15:19.149
which is why I got a permit
and now carry a gun.

15:19.184 --> 15:21.192
Which you were carrying
with you the other night.

15:21.192 --> 15:22.676
Yes.

15:22.677 --> 15:26.814
As I left the restaurant, a man
charged me in a dark alleyway.

15:26.849 --> 15:28.857
I called for him to stop.
He didn't.

15:28.857 --> 15:32.590
I saw black metal in his hand.
He raised it.

15:32.858 --> 15:37.457
I thought he was carrying a gun.
I reacted and shot first.

15:37.492 --> 15:41.425
A lot of people track you, follow you,
want to see you in person.

15:41.460 --> 15:43.577
That's the impression I'm getting, true?

15:43.577 --> 15:44.295
Yes.

15:44.296 --> 15:48.625
Most of these people, I'm guessing,
would be innocent fans

15:48.660 --> 15:50.831
just wanting to get close
to you. Also true?

15:50.831 --> 15:52.842
Or aggressive photographers.

15:52.877 --> 15:54.017
Yes.

15:54.018 --> 15:56.796
In fact, the other night when
you arrived at the restaurant,

15:56.796 --> 15:59.033
you were met by a slew
of paparazzi, weren't you?

15:59.033 --> 15:59.539
Yes.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.542
Also in fact, you had
an altercation on your way

16:01.542 --> 16:03.720
into the restaurant
that night, didn't you?

16:03.720 --> 16:04.569
Yes, I did.

16:04.604 --> 16:05.829
You'd had enough, hadn't you?

16:05.829 --> 16:06.429
Objection.

16:06.457 --> 16:07.502
This wasn't self-defense…

16:07.502 --> 16:07.774
Your honor…

16:07.774 --> 16:08.553
You were pissed off.

16:08.553 --> 16:09.297
I made an objection.

16:09.297 --> 16:09.946
Sustained.

16:09.981 --> 16:12.266
In particular, you had
a vendetta against this man.

16:12.266 --> 16:16.234
Objection. He just sustained
the objection.

16:18.407 --> 16:23.827
Ms Reese, you've encountered
Mr Rice before, haven't you?

16:24.928 --> 16:27.118
I didn't recognize him
at the time that I shot him.

16:27.118 --> 16:29.163
You didn't see him
going into the restaurant?

16:29.163 --> 16:31.906
I did, but I didn't know it was him
charging me in the alley.

16:31.906 --> 16:34.906
You once got a restraining order
against this man.

16:34.937 --> 16:37.690
I didn't know it was him when I fired.

16:37.725 --> 16:39.437
I see.

16:39.472 --> 16:40.402
You just got lucky?

16:40.402 --> 16:41.129
Objection.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.840
Sustained.

16:43.149 --> 16:45.772
Nothing further.

16:59.212 --> 17:01.371
Courtney, you should've told me
that you knew him.

17:01.371 --> 17:02.599
I don't really know him.

17:02.599 --> 17:05.117
There's a handful of paparazzi
who resort to terrorist tactics.

17:05.117 --> 17:06.826
And you knew him
to be one of them.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.464
I didn't recognize him in the alley.

17:08.464 --> 17:11.738
But you did recognize him
on your way into the restaurant.

17:11.738 --> 17:15.035
So you knew he was there.
You'd had previous run-ins with him.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.162
This could be construed
that you targeted him.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.297
I didn't.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.961
I believe you.

17:19.996 --> 17:21.394
Marry me.

17:21.429 --> 17:22.476
Does he have a mental problem?

17:22.476 --> 17:23.505
Yes.

17:23.506 --> 17:25.473
Are there any more surprises?

17:25.508 --> 17:26.179
Such as?

17:26.214 --> 17:28.388
Like are you really a man?

17:28.390 --> 17:29.181
I could live with that.

17:29.181 --> 17:32.940
Denny, go lust someplace else.

17:32.941 --> 17:36.001
How many run-ins have you had
with this particular photographer?

17:36.001 --> 17:38.588
Several, along with half a dozen
other photographers,

17:38.588 --> 17:41.108
but I didn't know it was him
when I fired.

17:41.549 --> 17:43.542
Right.

17:44.555 --> 17:46.791
I sincerely hope
the jury believes that.

17:46.791 --> 17:50.618
Otherwise, famous or not,
you're going to prison.

17:53.633 --> 17:56.562
There's nothing I can do.
It's his call. You know that.

17:56.562 --> 17:57.504
Why did he do this?

17:57.504 --> 17:58.053
I don't know.

17:58.053 --> 17:58.797
Did you tell him to?

17:58.797 --> 18:00.262
Of course not.

18:00.263 --> 18:01.103
Is this about my Whistler trip?

18:01.103 --> 18:02.242
Brad…

18:02.243 --> 18:03.473
Well, what happen?

18:03.614 --> 18:05.971
I called one of his former clerks.

18:05.972 --> 18:09.051
Evidently, judge Devon lost a teenage
daughter to a drug overdose.

18:09.051 --> 18:10.206
Maybe that's in play.

18:10.206 --> 18:11.293
–Great.
–I don't know.

18:11.293 --> 18:16.092
But he's a good judge. He's a fair one.
This seems way out of character.

18:17.862 --> 18:20.494
Also, for what it's worth,

18:20.529 --> 18:23.302
the clerk gave me some
additional back story.

18:23.337 --> 18:26.861
He had a little thing years ago
with one of your partners.

18:26.896 --> 18:27.677
Who?

18:27.712 --> 18:30.129
Shirley Schmidt.

18:33.414 --> 18:37.731
Marlene says that you conveniently
threw away her electronic planner

18:37.766 --> 18:41.474
the night before some of her
more critical appointments,

18:41.509 --> 18:44.650
including the one with the Kohns.

18:45.655 --> 18:50.480
First of all, I didn't poach
her clients. I did her a favor.

18:50.515 --> 18:56.666
And second of all, I didn't toss her precious
little device so she'd miss her appointment.

18:56.701 --> 19:00.848
I did it out of spite. Simple as that.

19:02.151 --> 19:06.210
I have to say, Denise, that personally,
I am very disappointed.

19:06.245 --> 19:07.229
Paul, you know me.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.980
Why else would I be disappointed?

19:09.981 --> 19:13.061
With the partnership vote this close,

19:13.096 --> 19:19.651
it amazes me that you would do
something so stupid to jeopardize it.

19:21.213 --> 19:21.996
Are you saying that…

19:21.996 --> 19:23.779
What I'm saying

19:23.780 --> 19:27.360
is that as of this moment,
your chances of making partner…

19:27.395 --> 19:30.121
have diminished.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.434
It's within the sentencing guidelines.

19:36.434 --> 19:38.813
It's not as if you can
argue abuse of discretion.

19:38.813 --> 19:41.122
But judges always allow
joint recommendations.

19:41.122 --> 19:43.809
But they're not bound by them,
Brad. You know that.

19:43.809 --> 19:45.183
She's 16 years old.

19:45.218 --> 19:49.073
Your only hope is to somehow
get him recused, but

19:49.108 --> 19:51.659
honestly, I wouldn't know how.

19:52.643 --> 19:55.433
I've been told that…

19:55.468 --> 19:59.672
You had a relationship
with this judge.

20:00.944 --> 20:03.373
Shirley, I would never try
to exploit this…

20:03.373 --> 20:06.121
Sure you would.
That's why you're here.

20:06.156 --> 20:08.242
I don't know what else to do.

20:08.277 --> 20:12.513
I won't get it overturned on appeal.
I don't know what else to do.

20:19.399 --> 20:21.399
She knew the paparazzi were there.

20:21.399 --> 20:23.329
She had an altercation on the way in.

20:23.329 --> 20:27.653
She had to know it was possible that
the man in the alley was a photographer.

20:27.653 --> 20:30.030
They ambush her all the time.
But what the hell?

20:30.030 --> 20:33.198
She opened fire anyway.
Figure in the darkness… Boom!

20:33.198 --> 20:36.900
Shoot first, ask questions later,
I guess.

20:36.935 --> 20:41.270
The truth is, celebrities like Courtney Reese
get away with things all the time.

20:41.270 --> 20:43.297
Tickets to the Rolling Stones concert,

20:43.297 --> 20:46.042
a table at a crowded restaurant
with no reservation.

20:46.042 --> 20:50.803
This is her life, all day, every day.
She gets away with things.

20:50.838 --> 20:56.387
And so when a photographer tries to
take her picture and she doesn't like it,

20:56.422 --> 21:01.558
and she happens to have a particular
grudge against this man,

21:01.593 --> 21:05.052
she thinks she can get away
with shooting him

21:05.087 --> 21:11.344
because fame is power, it is privilege,
it is a sense of entitlement.

21:12.363 --> 21:15.945
Now, I'm sure none of you want to live
in a world where there's one set of laws

21:15.945 --> 21:20.106
for the famous people and
another set for the rest of us.

21:20.141 --> 21:22.810
The facts in this case do not say

21:22.845 --> 21:28.843
that Courtney Reese is an actress or
a model or a world-famous celebrity.

21:28.878 --> 21:36.414
The facts in this case say that she's a criminal
who tried to murder somebody.

21:53.616 --> 21:59.532
A neurobiologist at Duke university
conducted an experiment

21:59.567 --> 22:03.267
where he gave a group
of thirsty monkeys

22:03.302 --> 22:06.052
a choice of either
having their favorite drink,

22:06.052 --> 22:08.734
which was some sort
of cherry juice concoction,

22:08.734 --> 22:11.194
or of having the opportunity

22:11.229 --> 22:16.679
to look at pictures of the dominant
celebrity monkey of their pack.

22:16.714 --> 22:22.663
Despite their thirst and the allure
of the cherry juice,

22:22.698 --> 22:24.713
they chose to look at the pictures.

22:24.713 --> 22:28.850
Apparently, monkeys have
a part of their brain

22:28.885 --> 22:35.570
that specifically responds
to the thrill of celebrity, as do we.

22:35.605 --> 22:37.551
Think about that for a moment.

22:37.586 --> 22:44.923
A part of our intricate, fantastic
and powerful, mental machinery

22:44.958 --> 22:50.187
specifically responds to
Courtney Reese and others

22:50.222 --> 22:53.359
who have achieved
her level of notoriety.

22:53.394 --> 23:00.430
We have hundreds of magazines and
web sites to follow them, track them,

23:00.465 --> 23:05.059
stalk them, not to mention cultivate
a public obsession for them.

23:05.094 --> 23:09.763
It is totally and utterly out of control.

23:09.798 --> 23:17.583
Her fear of being followed or assaulted
or even murdered is not an irrational one.

23:17.618 --> 23:23.457
She receives threats on her life,
obsessive declarations of love,

23:23.492 --> 23:29.297
psychotic musings about imagined
relations or phantom encounters.

23:29.332 --> 23:32.133
And because of celebrity stalker
web sites,

23:32.168 --> 23:35.724
her movements and whereabouts
can be tracked to the second.

23:35.759 --> 23:38.805
That's the world she lives in.

23:38.840 --> 23:41.816
So what happened that night?

23:41.851 --> 23:45.938
A man came towards her
in the dark, quickly.

23:45.973 --> 23:47.828
She told him to stop. He didn't.

23:47.828 --> 23:51.036
Fearing for her life,
she acted to protect herself.

23:51.071 --> 23:52.461
She didn't shoot to kill.

23:52.461 --> 23:54.910
She wounded him in the shoulder
to stop his charge.

23:54.910 --> 23:56.905
She was afraid.

23:57.442 --> 24:01.293
Was her fear reasonable?

24:03.756 --> 24:09.885
Some years ago, a young actress
named Rebecca Schaeffer

24:09.920 --> 24:16.383
was shot and killed by a fan
in front of her apartment building.

24:16.418 --> 24:21.687
Monica Seles was stabbed in the back
on a tennis court during a match.

24:21.722 --> 24:26.957
Gianni Versace was gunned down as
he stepped from his home in Miami.

24:26.992 --> 24:30.149
George Harrison was stabbed
in his home in the country.

24:30.149 --> 24:35.688
John Lennon was shot four times
in the back by a devoted fan.

24:35.723 --> 24:39.962
As he was coming home
in the evening with his wife.

24:39.997 --> 24:44.954
Courtney Reese carried a gun with her
because of all that had come before.

24:44.989 --> 24:48.185
And she didn't want to be next.

24:49.441 --> 24:53.987
That… is reasonable.

25:16.603 --> 25:18.115
Simon.

25:19.261 --> 25:23.496
<i>Ex-parte</i>, Shirley. You of all
people should know better.

25:23.531 --> 25:27.732
Yes. Let's file this meeting
under that category, then.

25:27.767 --> 25:30.766
“Things we should know better”.

25:31.082 --> 25:32.549
A boy died.

25:32.584 --> 25:37.171
So did a girl, 12 years ago.
Is that in play?

25:37.206 --> 25:39.218
You're out of line.

25:39.253 --> 25:42.167
A wise man once said to me,

25:42.202 --> 25:45.047
over a Martini, I believe,

25:45.082 --> 25:48.681
you can take all the facts of a case,
figure in all the lawyers,

25:48.681 --> 25:51.368
extenuating circumstances, and still,

25:51.403 --> 25:55.204
people forget, in the end, it all
really comes down to the judge.

25:55.204 --> 25:58.942
You said it with such
a charming twinkle.

25:58.977 --> 26:00.946
I was trying to get laid.

26:00.981 --> 26:03.368
And, boy, did you?

26:05.237 --> 26:10.408
A case in my office has fallen
into the hands of the wrong judge.

26:10.443 --> 26:14.185
This ruling can't bring
your daughter back, Simon.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.399
But perhaps it can stop
others from dying.

26:16.399 --> 26:17.918
Do you really believe that?

26:17.918 --> 26:21.420
What I believe is none
of your damn business.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.316
I came in to play nicely.

26:23.351 --> 26:25.218
You're wasting your time, Shirley.

26:25.218 --> 26:28.362
Actually, Simon, I'm not.

26:28.397 --> 26:33.104
I'm prepared to audit your sentencing
on drug cases to see if there's a pattern.

26:33.104 --> 26:37.085
I am prepared to make it very public
should there be a pattern.

26:37.120 --> 26:41.449
I'm also willing to expose
other patterns of a happily,

26:41.484 --> 26:46.042
perhaps unhappily married judge.

26:48.659 --> 26:49.710
Screw you.

26:49.745 --> 26:51.617
You did that already.

26:51.618 --> 26:54.514
Now you're doing it
to a 16-year-old girl.

26:54.549 --> 26:57.511
I will not allow for it, Simon.

26:57.546 --> 27:01.294
I will bring down upon you
the wrath of my entire firm,

27:01.329 --> 27:06.549
for which you will be
no match. No offense.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.318
That squid.

27:15.353 --> 27:16.538
I need you to talk to Paul.

27:16.538 --> 27:17.787
Me?

27:17.788 --> 27:19.776
Hey, he respects you.

27:19.811 --> 27:22.393
I'm not entirely sure
that would be appropriate.

27:22.393 --> 27:24.964
Why, because we're sleeping together?

27:24.999 --> 27:27.023
No, because it's a direct violation
of firm policy.

27:27.023 --> 27:30.423
I'm a partner. You're an associate.
It just wouldn't look good.

27:30.423 --> 27:33.431
Brad, this has nothing
to do with our sex life.

27:33.466 --> 27:36.983
It has to do with you knowing
I am an excellent lawyer,

27:37.018 --> 27:40.501
and I deserve to make partner.
It's as simple as that.

27:41.357 --> 27:43.264
You do deserve this.

27:43.299 --> 27:44.294
I'll talk to him.

27:44.294 --> 27:46.088
Thank you.

28:34.267 --> 28:38.299
Paul, Shirley, listen, before this
gets twisted by the wrong person,

28:38.299 --> 28:40.393
I just want you to know,
I am having sex with Brad.

28:40.393 --> 28:43.010
And while I did ask him to speak to you
on my behalf regarding partnership,

28:43.010 --> 28:45.220
that has nothing to do
with us having sex

28:45.220 --> 28:47.905
and everything to do with the fact
that I am an excellent attorney.

28:47.905 --> 28:50.140
Is that clear?

28:52.155 --> 28:55.041
My office, now.

29:00.922 --> 29:03.321
So we just wait?

29:03.356 --> 29:08.626
The judge said, “Don't leave”.
That means the jury is probably close.

29:15.236 --> 29:17.290
And if we lose?

29:18.285 --> 29:21.529
How much time
will I have to serve?

29:21.564 --> 29:24.031
There's no telling.

29:24.066 --> 29:27.606
A normal person would serve
maybe three, four years.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.463
But you're a figment.

29:30.498 --> 29:35.497
I'm not sure what
the sentence is for those.

29:36.928 --> 29:42.708
How odd it must feel to be
the object of so many…

29:42.743 --> 29:48.088
strangers… dreams and wantings

29:48.864 --> 29:53.670
I have little doubt you're able
to trade significantly on that.

29:54.304 --> 29:56.540
But?

29:58.160 --> 30:01.363
It has no currency with me.

30:04.235 --> 30:08.074
Well, lucky for me you're
more convincing in the courtroom.

30:08.109 --> 30:09.217
You do not believe me.

30:09.217 --> 30:11.976
No, I do not.

30:15.152 --> 30:20.180
All you ever really have to do
is snap your fingers, right?

30:20.215 --> 30:23.172
Oh, has it come to that?

30:23.754 --> 30:28.007
You actually gonna make me snap?

30:32.435 --> 30:35.292
As of five minutes ago,
all of this nonsense has stopped.

30:35.292 --> 30:38.292
The intrigue, the spying,
the tattling, the games…

30:38.310 --> 30:41.470
Marlene, don't turn your head away
when I'm speaking of you.

30:41.470 --> 30:42.897
Sorry, Shirley.

30:42.932 --> 30:47.016
Ever since you arrived at this firm,
there has been a current of spite.

30:47.016 --> 30:51.276
It will stop as well. If it doesn't,
consider it grounds for dismissal.

30:51.356 --> 30:56.139
Marlene, leave. Denise, stay.

31:03.535 --> 31:06.637
Denise, you will not be making partner.

31:06.672 --> 31:07.107
What?

31:07.142 --> 31:11.330
Regardless of all your other antics,
the fact that you have slept with Brad

31:11.330 --> 31:15.111
exposes this entire firm
to sexual harassment lawsuits.

31:15.146 --> 31:16.209
That's absurd.

31:16.244 --> 31:19.608
There are people sleeping with
each other all over this law firm.

31:19.608 --> 31:21.836
Alan Shore ‘mated’ two women

31:21.871 --> 31:24.028
and had them trying to murder
each other in the lobby.

31:24.028 --> 31:26.648
You're comparing yourself to Alan Shore now?

31:26.648 --> 31:28.625
How low are you going here?

31:28.660 --> 31:33.011
Shirley, don't you see,
she is ruining our family?

31:33.046 --> 31:38.849
This isn't a family.
It's a law firm.

31:38.884 --> 31:43.088
So Marlene's getting my spot.

31:44.036 --> 31:47.084
What spot?

31:47.424 --> 31:50.824
Denise, when Marlene was hired here,

31:50.859 --> 31:56.365
she brought in several major clients
and it was always our intention
to make her partner.

31:56.400 --> 32:00.205
Why did you think
you were competing with her?

32:02.575 --> 32:05.869
So that's it then?

32:06.598 --> 32:09.956
I'm afraid so.

32:47.243 --> 32:49.604
Hey, Guido.

32:58.253 --> 33:01.601
Madam Foreperson,
have you reached a verdict?

33:01.636 --> 33:03.546
We have, your honor.

33:03.581 --> 33:04.605
Be strong.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.629
I'll try.

33:05.630 --> 33:07.808
This is LA, it's always “not guilty”.

33:07.808 --> 33:12.576
We the jury find
the defendant Courtney Reese…

33:13.148 --> 33:15.699
not guilty.

33:18.850 --> 33:22.792
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this court
would like to thank you for your service.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.043
You are dismissed.

33:25.078 --> 33:27.598
This court is adjourned.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.092
Denny.

33:40.877 --> 33:41.994
Let's just keep moving.

33:41.994 --> 33:43.151
What about my statement?

33:43.151 --> 33:44.915
I'll make the statement.

33:44.950 --> 33:46.680
–My firm.
–My coast.

33:46.681 --> 33:49.726
You can both make statements.
We'll wait for you in the witness room.

33:49.726 --> 33:51.373
–Barry Goal.
–Denny Crane.

33:51.408 --> 33:53.104
Barry Goal.

33:59.926 --> 34:01.658
Thank you.

34:02.202 --> 34:04.348
My pleasure.

34:06.516 --> 34:09.228
So what happens now?

34:09.263 --> 34:11.023
You just…

34:11.058 --> 34:14.637
Hop on a plane and fly back to Boston?

34:15.241 --> 34:17.817
Immediately.

34:19.656 --> 34:25.902
Is it really so awful to admit
that you're attracted to me?

34:27.496 --> 34:29.565
No.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.635
But?

34:34.706 --> 34:38.985
Denny and I have
a little arrangement.

34:39.569 --> 34:42.940
He picked you first.

34:43.518 --> 34:48.255
I see. So… if he happened
to pick the love of your life first,

34:48.260 --> 34:52.922
you would just… go with it?

34:52.958 --> 34:55.371
You're not the love of my life.

34:55.407 --> 34:57.729
So far.

35:04.263 --> 35:07.931
We're not gonna kiss, are we?

35:07.966 --> 35:11.600
–Denny's girl.
–In his mind.

35:11.635 --> 35:14.836
Where it counts.

35:19.142 --> 35:21.342
Cheek?

35:21.377 --> 35:24.836
I'll give you a cheek.

35:42.342 --> 35:46.654
So if I ever shoot anybody else…

35:47.332 --> 35:51.114
You have my number.

36:07.344 --> 36:10.488
–So you're not dead?
–Not yet.

36:10.523 --> 36:13.598
I… you… you went away, and…

36:13.633 --> 36:18.533
I didn't hear anything, Switzerland…

36:18.568 --> 36:22.364
Are you dying… are you better?

36:22.399 --> 36:26.161
They were very, very, very good.

36:26.196 --> 36:28.450
But it was awful.

36:28.485 --> 36:34.165
Uh, you wouldn't have liked you to have
seen me. I was at least 7% less cute.

36:34.855 --> 36:37.042
Chocolate.

36:39.418 --> 36:42.180
This nonsense… I… I don't know
what I was thinking.

36:42.180 --> 36:45.886
Marlene and partnerships,

36:45.921 --> 36:48.757
office politics… none of it matters.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.612
Yeah.

36:50.613 --> 36:53.708
Whatever.

36:53.743 --> 36:56.803
Listen, uh…

36:59.771 --> 37:03.059
You want to marry me?

37:16.916 --> 37:20.042
Shirley, the judge reconsidered.
He gave us the three months.

37:20.042 --> 37:20.974
I'm glad to hear that.

37:20.974 --> 37:21.961
Thank you.

37:21.962 --> 37:23.046
What'd you do?

37:23.081 --> 37:25.374
I traded on an old friendship,
per your suggestion.

37:25.374 --> 37:26.457
I don't know what to say.

37:26.457 --> 37:29.510
You said, “thank you.”
That covered it.

37:29.684 --> 37:31.440
Denny, you're back.

37:31.475 --> 37:34.122
I am? I am. And I'm all here.

37:34.157 --> 37:36.389
Congratulations on your big victory.

37:36.424 --> 37:37.591
It's all over the news. Married?

37:37.591 --> 37:38.655
No.

37:38.656 --> 37:40.402
–You tried.
–I did.

37:40.437 --> 37:41.317
Where's Alan?

37:41.352 --> 37:44.396
Around. He said he had
something to take care of.

37:44.397 --> 37:45.447
Well, welcome back.

37:45.447 --> 37:47.419
Shirley…

37:47.420 --> 37:49.584
This is a Sweeps episode.

37:49.619 --> 37:51.245
I'm not kissing you.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.505
Shirley!

37:52.506 --> 37:55.958
I'm in my 70s. I'm still a physical
specimen, but you never know.

37:55.958 --> 37:57.747
What if I drop dead one day,

37:57.782 --> 38:01.305
and you never got that
last tonsil brushing?

38:01.340 --> 38:05.718
You always present the most
ethically challenging “what-ifers.”

38:05.753 --> 38:09.754
Your loss. And mine.

38:12.526 --> 38:14.672
Denny.

38:22.363 --> 38:25.505
Just in case.

38:40.846 --> 38:42.953
Mr Shore.

38:52.821 --> 38:54.980
Ah, it's okay.

38:55.015 --> 38:55.940
Springtime.

38:55.975 --> 38:59.056
I'm going to rewrite that office manual.

39:20.180 --> 39:23.603
Denny, I'm gonna need
a new glass top for my desk.

39:23.638 --> 39:25.741
What happened to you?

39:27.453 --> 39:30.268
There was a spider in my office.

39:30.303 --> 39:31.311
Shirley kissed me.

39:31.311 --> 39:33.118
Voluntarily?

39:33.119 --> 39:35.301
Of course.

39:36.978 --> 39:39.192
She still loves me.

39:39.227 --> 39:41.339
Maybe I should marry her.

39:41.374 --> 39:43.240
Shouldn't you first get over Courtney?

39:43.240 --> 39:45.776
Well, my interest in Courtney
was mainly… mmm.

39:45.776 --> 39:47.627
Firearms?

39:48.118 --> 39:49.407
She'd shoot you in the end.

39:49.407 --> 39:51.491
Perhaps before.

39:53.972 --> 39:56.145
I really didn't love LA.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.361
Full of false, <i>faux</i> people.

39:57.361 --> 39:58.261
You felt at home?

39:58.261 --> 39:59.652
I did.

40:01.653 --> 40:06.732
I used to love visiting LA.
Because it was so La-La.

40:06.767 --> 40:09.392
It made me appreciate Boston more.

40:09.427 --> 40:13.237
But lately, it seems the whole country
is a little La-La.

40:13.272 --> 40:15.719
Oh, not the red States.

40:17.282 --> 40:21.794
We're bubblegum nation, Denny,
Tinseltown especially.

40:21.829 --> 40:27.847
There used to be a day when the pandering
in our society was reserved for…

40:27.882 --> 40:29.792
Politicians.

40:31.632 --> 40:36.247
Maybe that's what bothers me. Hollywood
has sunk to the level of congress.

40:38.426 --> 40:41.253
You ever wonder
if you and I are La-La?

40:41.288 --> 40:46.502
Don't be ridiculous. We're flamingos…
And good ones.

40:46.537 --> 40:51.331
At least one thing remains constant.
I do enjoy traveling with you.

40:51.366 --> 40:57.012
And the best part is,
we always come home together.

40:57.047 --> 41:00.046
To more travels, Denny.

41:00.081 --> 41:01.093
To the mountains…

41:01.093 --> 41:02.901
Prairies…

41:03.143 --> 41:05.024
The whores.

41:05.059 --> 41:07.611
America the beautiful.

41:11.598 --> 41:14.292
To next season, my friend.

41:14.327 --> 41:16.154
Same night?

41:16.189 --> 41:17.982
God, I hope.

41:18.305 --> 41:24.814
