00:01.500 --> 00:03.417
YOU KINDA WANT
TO EASE INTO IT.

00:03.417 --> 00:06.250
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S A VERY GENTLE
KINDA GIVE AND TAKE...

00:06.250 --> 00:08.000
ACTION, ALL RIGHT?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.583
SO...YOU MIGHT WANT
TO DO IT RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

00:09.583 --> 00:12.333
WAIT! OH!

00:12.333 --> 00:15.500
OK, REMEMBER WHEN
I SAID THAT THING

00:15.500 --> 00:19.500
ABOUT STEPPING ON THE CLUTCH
BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY
TRY AND SHIFT?

00:19.500 --> 00:21.458
IS THAT
COMING BACK TO YOU?

00:21.458 --> 00:24.083
UM...SO YOU'RE
IN NEUTRAL NOW.
PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE CLUTCH--

00:24.083 --> 00:27.000
NO, NO.
THAT'S IT! OK?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
I DON'T WANT TO LEARN
TO DRIVE ANYMORE.
IT'S TOO HARD.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.750
OH, ARE WE THERE YET?

00:31.750 --> 00:36.333
LOOK, COME ON, KIDDIES.

00:36.333 --> 00:37.458
WE'RE BARELY HALFWAY
DOWN THE DRIVEWAY.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.041
WHAT ON EARTH HAVE
YOU GUYS BEEN DOIN' UP HERE?

00:39.041 --> 00:41.333
SEE, THIS IS
A SHINING EXAMPLE

00:41.333 --> 00:43.417
OF WHY FRIENDS
SHOULD NOT TEACH FRIENDS
TO DRIVE STICK.

00:43.417 --> 00:44.875
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
LLOYD DOBLER.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.375
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:46.375 --> 00:48.917
SAY ANYTHING,
JOHN CUSACK TEACHES
IONE SKYE HOW TO DRIVE.

00:48.917 --> 00:50.750
YEAH?
EXCEPT, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

00:50.750 --> 00:52.333
HE WAS QUITE THE PATIENT TUTOR.

00:52.333 --> 00:53.583
AS I REMEMBER,
SHE ACTUALLY LISTENED
TO HIS TUTORIAL.

00:53.583 --> 00:57.041
OK, KIDS, LET'S TRY AND FIND
THE LOVE UP THERE, SHALL WE?

00:57.041 --> 01:01.708
YOU KNOW, DAWSON,
WHAT SAY YOU AND I INVITE
MISS JOSEPHINE POTTER

01:01.708 --> 01:03.583
TO STEP OUT ON
THE TOWN WITH US TONIGHT?

01:03.583 --> 01:07.750
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'VE
GOT PRIOR VALENTINE'S DAY
PLAN WITH THE COLLEGE BEAU.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.041
NO, MASSIVE
MIDTERM CRISIS.

01:10.041 --> 01:11.333
EXCUSE ME?

01:11.333 --> 01:13.375
WHAT KINDA MORON
WOULD RATHER SHOVE
HIS NOSE IN A BOOK

01:13.375 --> 01:16.208
THEN TAKE HIS GIRL OUT
FOR VALENTINE'S DAY?

01:16.208 --> 01:18.250
PACEY, I KNOW
IT'S A HARD CONCEPT
FOR YOU TO GRASP,

01:18.250 --> 01:19.208
BUT SOME PEOPLE
ARE ACTUALLY DEDICATED

01:19.208 --> 01:22.417
TO THE PURSUIT
OF ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE.

01:22.417 --> 01:25.625
OK, SO THEN WHY DON'T
YOU JUST COME WITH US?
IT'LL BE FUN.

DEPENDS ON WHAT
GOOFUS AND GALLANT ARE
UP TO THIS EVENING.

01:28.250 --> 01:31.750
WELL, AS IT HAPPENS,
MATT CAUFIELD IS THROWING

01:31.750 --> 01:34.000
A MASSIVE
ANTI-VALENTINE'S DAY PARTY.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.917
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO GO TO A MATT
CAUFIELD PARTY?

01:35.917 --> 01:38.125
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM?
WHY WOULDN'T WE?

01:38.125 --> 01:40.834
HEH. WELL, THAT
SURPRISES ME, DAWSON.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.083
WHY?

01:42.083 --> 01:43.166
MATT CAUFIELD? HE'S NOT
EXACTLY OF YOUR TRIBE.

01:43.166 --> 01:45.750
HE'S A CREEP, AND
HIS PARTIES ARE INFAMOUS

01:45.750 --> 01:47.458
FOR COMPLETE AND
UTTER DEBAUCHERY.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.083
WHY ARE YOU COMIN' DOWN
ON A GUY

01:49.083 --> 01:52.375
FOR WANTING TO SHED HIS SKIN
AND HAVE SOME FUN FOR A CHANGE?

01:52.375 --> 01:53.542
WHY ARE YOU DRAGGING HIM
INTO A SEEDY, DEPRAVED WORLD

01:53.542 --> 01:56.208
RESERVED FOR BOTTOM-FEEDERS
LIKE YOURSELF?

01:56.208 --> 01:57.250
THIS TUG-OF-WAR OVER
MY MORALITY IS ENTERTAINING,

01:57.250 --> 02:00.250
BUT WE GOTTA GET GOING.
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.291
AS MUCH AS THE IDEA
OF WATCHING THE TWO OF YOU

02:01.291 --> 02:04.083
MAKE FOOLS OF YOURSELVES
IS APPEALING TO ME,

02:04.083 --> 02:06.208
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PASS
ON THE WHOLE PARTY THING...

02:06.208 --> 02:07.875
AND MAKE IT
A BLOCKBUSTER NIGHT.

02:07.875 --> 02:11.917
YOU KNOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT IDEA, JOE.

02:11.917 --> 02:14.333

TO DRIVE YA?

03:10.750 --> 03:14.208

CAN YOU IMAGINE THE LIFE
THAT THAT GUY'S LEADING?

03:14.208 --> 03:17.375
URBAN LEGEND HAS IT HE SLEPT
WITH 6 CHEERLEADERS
IN ONE WEEKEND.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.333
I'M TELLIN' YOU, MAN,
WE GOTTA GO TO THAT PARTY.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.959
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
MAYBE JOEY'S RIGHT.

03:21.959 --> 03:24.542
AW, WHAT IS THIS?
IS THIS DOUBT I'M HEARING,
YOUNG SKYWALKER?

03:24.542 --> 03:27.959
I'M NOT EXACTLY CUT OUT
FOR A CAREER
IN HEDONISM.

03:27.959 --> 03:30.959
DAWSON, PICK UP
THE PHONE ALREADY.
THIS IS YOUR CALL TO ACTION.

03:30.959 --> 03:34.625
OK? YOUR HERO'S JOURNEY
BEGINS NOW, MY FRIEND.

03:34.625 --> 03:37.417
PACEY WITTER,
THE POOR MAN'S YODA.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.417
YOU KNOW, I'VE ACTUALLY
ALWAYS SEEN MYSELF MORE
AS THE HAN SOLO TYPE.

03:39.417 --> 03:44.250
ROGUISH GOOD LOOKS.
DEVIL-MAY-CARE ATTITUDE.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.375

03:45.375 --> 03:47.375
HEY, HERE COMES
MY CHEWBACCA.

03:47.375 --> 03:48.417
WHAT?

03:48.417 --> 03:50.667
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
ANYWAY, HAVE ANY LUCK?

03:50.667 --> 03:53.250
YEAH, I TALKED TO SOME
OF THE GUYS ON THE TEAM,

03:53.250 --> 03:57.375
AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE LOCATION IS
COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.917
I GUESS CAUFIELD AND
SOME OF HIS BUDDIES WERE
AFRAID IF, YOU KNOW,

03:59.917 --> 04:03.208
THE COPS GET WIND OF IT
THEY'LL BUST IT UP.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.667
BUT I DID GET
THE PASSWORD.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.875
NICE!

04:07.875 --> 04:10.708
WHAT IS IT?

04:12.250 --> 04:14.750
I KNOW KUNG FU.

04:16.750 --> 04:17.959
I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY,
HENRY,

04:17.959 --> 04:18.834
YOU CAN ONLY SELL PLASMA
EVERY 72 HOURS.

04:18.834 --> 04:21.541
BUT I FEEL FINE.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.250
I KNOW THAT
HUGE HEART OF YOURS

04:23.250 --> 04:24.959
COULD PROBABLY FILL
HALF THE BLOOD BANKS
IN NEW ENGLAND,

04:24.959 --> 04:27.291
BUT I'M SORRY.

04:27.291 --> 04:29.166
PLEASE? I GOT A DATE
WITH AN ANGEL TONIGHT.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.917
AND EVERYTHING
IS ALMOST PERFECT.

04:31.917 --> 04:35.708
I SPENT THE LAST 2 WEEKS
WORKING AT HER FAVORITE
RESTAURANT TO PAY FOR THE MEAL.

04:35.708 --> 04:38.333
I--I'VE GOT A RESERVATION
AT THE BEST TABLE.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.083
NOW, IF I CAN JUST SELL
ONE MORE PINT,

04:40.083 --> 04:41.959
I'LL HAVE ENOUGH
FOR A GIFT.

04:41.959 --> 04:45.291
I CAN'T BEND
THE RULES.

04:45.291 --> 04:47.542
NURSE NICOLE,

04:47.542 --> 04:50.083
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
THERE'S A GUY

EVERY DAY

04:51.917 --> 04:55.417
AND DREAMS ABOUT YOU
EVERY NIGHT.

04:55.417 --> 04:59.542
A GUY WHO WOULD
SELL HIS BLOOD
JUST TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

04:59.542 --> 05:00.959
WELL, HE'S LATE.

05:00.959 --> 05:03.083
MAYBE HE'S STUCK.

05:03.083 --> 05:07.625
MAYBE SOMEONE WON'T...

05:07.625 --> 05:10.208
BEND THE RULES FOR HIM.

05:12.959 --> 05:16.291
ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVE.

05:16.291 --> 05:19.667
AND PROMISE ME
YOU'LL GET SOME REST

THIS DUBIOUS HONOR?

CAN'T A FELLOW
JUST WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH HIS BROTHER?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.250
DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE?

05:35.250 --> 05:38.667

THAT SATANIC RACKET
YOU GOT GOIN' IN THERE?

05:38.667 --> 05:39.625

05:39.625 --> 05:41.625
OH, LISTEN TO
THAT VOICE, PACEY.

05:41.625 --> 05:44.125
IS THAT NOT
A CAUSE FOR JOY?

05:44.125 --> 05:46.834
I MEAN, IS THAT
NOT THE VOICE OF A DIVA?

05:46.834 --> 05:49.125
DOUGIE, IF YOU
CONTINUE IN THIS MANNER,

05:49.125 --> 05:52.667
YOU ARE GOING TO FORCE
ME TO UNLEASH A SALVO
OF GAY STEREOTYPE HUMOR

05:52.667 --> 05:55.458
THAT WILL LEAVE YOU
BREATHLESS AND
QUIVERING. OK?

ALWAYS A PLEASURE,
PACEY, BUT I GOT
SOMEWHERE TO BE.

05:57.417 --> 05:59.917
WELL, LOOK, MAYBE
I COULD DO A RIDE ALONG
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.166

WANT TO DO THAT?

I LOOK UP TO YOU.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.333

BUT I THINK IT
WILL BE FASCINATING

BREATHE DEEPLY.

19:58.208 --> 19:58.834
HE'LL BE AT
ST. MATTHEW'S LATER.

19:58.834 --> 20:01.166
HE'LL BE FINE.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.750
GOD, HENRY,
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
YOU SOLD YOUR BLOOD.

20:03.750 --> 20:05.500
TWICE IN
A 48-HOUR PERIOD.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.125
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

20:07.125 --> 20:10.041
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
I DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE

20:10.041 --> 20:11.875
TO MAKE TONIGHT
UNFORGETTABLE.

20:11.875 --> 20:12.667
WELL, YOU DID. HA.

20:12.667 --> 20:15.959
AND I WANTED
TO BUY YOU THIS.

20:15.959 --> 20:18.625
HENRY...

20:21.375 --> 20:22.166
IT'S A RING.

20:22.166 --> 20:26.375
AND--AND--
AND IT'S ORANGE.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.750
IT'S HUNGARIAN RED.
TRY IT ON.

20:28.750 --> 20:29.959
OH.

20:31.792 --> 20:33.834
NO!

20:33.834 --> 20:35.291
HENRY, HENRY, PLEASE
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS.

20:35.291 --> 20:37.417
I RUINED IT.
I RUINED EVERYTHING.

20:37.417 --> 20:38.875
IT'S--IT'S--
HENRY, IT'S FINE.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.083
PLEASE DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.166
I WANTED--
I WANTED EVERYTHING
TO BE SO PERFECT.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.667
IT IS.
THIS IS PERFECT.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.417
IT--IT'S PERFECT.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.917
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

21:00.917 --> 21:03.417
REALLY?

21:03.417 --> 21:05.417
AND, UH...

21:05.417 --> 21:07.458
AND WHAT'S THAT?

21:07.458 --> 21:10.250
YOU'RE THE RESIDENT
CARETAKER.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.917
[CHUCKLES] THE WHAT?

21:11.917 --> 21:13.917
THE GANG'S NICE GUY.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.083
FREDDIE FRIENDLY.

21:16.083 --> 21:20.458
THE ONE WHO
VOLUNTEERS TO TAKE
HIGHLY EMOTIONAL

21:20.458 --> 21:23.583
AND PROGRESSIVELY
WASTED TYPES OFF
OF EVERYBODY'S HANDS

21:23.583 --> 21:26.291
SO THE OTHER BOYS
CAN GO AND HAVE FUN.

21:26.291 --> 21:28.625
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT LITTLE
OL' ME, DAWSON.

21:28.625 --> 21:30.917
I WILL PRESENT YOU
WITH NO BURDEN
WHATSOEVER.

21:30.917 --> 21:33.959
THIS PLACE IS HILLY.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.000
OH, WAIT.
WAIT A MINUTE.

21:37.291 --> 21:38.000
WHY WOULD YOU
ASSUME THAT?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.041
ASSUME WHAT?

21:40.041 --> 21:42.667
THAT I'M A NICE GUY.

21:42.667 --> 21:48.750
I MEAN, MAYBE I COULD BE
TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR SITUATION.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.542
[LAUGHS]

21:51.542 --> 21:53.291
AND YOU FIND THAT
HUMOROUS.

21:53.291 --> 21:57.125
I MAY BE DRUNK,
AND I MAY HARDLY
KNOW YOU,

21:57.125 --> 21:58.959
BUT THAT'S NOT YOU.

21:58.959 --> 22:00.041
IT ISN'T?

22:00.041 --> 22:02.083
NO. IT ISN'T.

22:03.375 --> 22:06.917
I MEAN,
FIRST OF ALL, WHO
IN A MILLION YEARS

22:06.917 --> 22:10.041
THAT WAS TRYING
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF MY SITUATION

22:10.041 --> 22:12.417
WOULD
USE THE EXPRESSION,

22:12.417 --> 22:15.333
"I'M TRYING
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR SITUATION"?

22:15.333 --> 22:17.000
[LAUGHS]

22:17.000 --> 22:19.125
[SIGHS]

22:20.875 --> 22:23.458
IS IT REALLY
TOO MUCH, HEH,

22:23.458 --> 22:28.375
TO ASK THE UNIVERSE
THAT--THAT ONCE,
J-JUST ONCE,

22:28.375 --> 22:31.959
JUST ONE SINGLE,
SOLITARY TIME

22:31.959 --> 22:35.208
CAN YOU CONSPIRE
WITH MY DESIRE
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME?

22:35.208 --> 22:36.959
QUIT WHINING.

22:36.959 --> 22:39.500
THERE ARE
PEOPLE DYING
IN THE BALKANS.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.625
YOU BE QUIET, OK?

22:42.625 --> 22:43.667
THIS IS BETWEEN ME
AND THE FATES.

22:43.667 --> 22:48.834
CALL ME LOCO,
BUT MAYBE IF
YOU JUST ACTED

22:48.834 --> 22:51.500
INSTEAD OF
HEMMING AND HAWING

22:51.500 --> 22:53.500
AND DEBATING
AND CONVERSING,

22:53.500 --> 22:55.500
THEN MAYBE
YOU'D ACTUALLY
SEE SOME RESULTS.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.708
[SIGHS] WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

22:58.708 --> 23:00.875
SIMPLY PUT...

23:00.875 --> 23:04.500
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE A NICE GUY, DAWSON,

23:04.500 --> 23:07.625
WHEN YOU TAKE A GIRL
INTO THE WOODS,

23:07.625 --> 23:11.208
DON'T TALK TO HER
ABOUT KISSING HER.

23:11.208 --> 23:12.333
KISS HER.

23:12.333 --> 23:14.708
E-ESPECIALLY
AFTER YOU'VE TOLD HER

23:14.708 --> 23:18.166
THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
IN THE WAY THAT BEAUTIFUL

23:18.166 --> 23:20.333
USED TO ACTUALLY
MEAN SOMETHING.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.917
IT'S THAT SIMPLE?

23:22.917 --> 23:24.375
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

23:33.417 --> 23:35.583
HOLD THAT IMPULSE.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.375
[COUGHING AND VOMITING]

23:42.208 --> 23:43.959
PERFECT.

23:43.959 --> 23:45.583
JUST...

23:45.583 --> 23:46.542
PERFECT.

23:58.542 --> 24:00.417
Grams:
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

24:00.417 --> 24:02.708
UNFORTUNATELY
NOT EARLY ENOUGH.

24:04.750 --> 24:05.750
THE HAGGARD GIRL THAT
YOU'RE LOOKING AT NOW

24:05.750 --> 24:08.583
IS STRAIGHT
FROM THE DATE
FROM HELL.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.250
SOMETHING FOR
YOU AND HENRY
TO LAUGH ABOUT

24:10.250 --> 24:11.708
ON YOUR
SECOND DATE.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.583
SADLY ENOUGH,
I DON'T THINK

24:13.583 --> 24:15.792
THERE'S GONNA BE
A SECOND DATE, GRAMS.

24:15.792 --> 24:18.417
BECAUSE
OF JUST ONE
SOUR EVENING?

24:18.417 --> 24:20.583
THIS WAS OUR
FIRST REAL DATE,

24:20.583 --> 24:24.250
AND TO CALL IT SOUR
WOULD BE A KIND REVIEW.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.542
JENNIFER, YOU HAVE
GOT TO GET OVER
YOUR PRECONCEPTIONS

24:26.542 --> 24:28.208
ABOUT WHAT A DATE
IS SUPPOSED TO BE.

24:28.208 --> 24:30.458
A DATE IS, EH--

24:30.458 --> 24:33.500
EVEN IF IT'S
A BAD ONE, IS
JUST ANOTHER MOMENT.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.458
IT'S JUST ANOTHER--
ANOTHER PEARL IN A--

24:35.458 --> 24:38.166
IN A GREAT,
WONDROUS NECKLACE.

24:38.166 --> 24:41.125
OK, BEFORE YOU
WAX GERIATRIC,

24:41.125 --> 24:41.750
LET ME JUST
CUT TO THE CHASE.

24:43.417 --> 24:45.458
HENRY IS RIGHT NOW
IN THE HOSPITAL

24:45.458 --> 24:48.125
BECAUSE HE
OVERSOLD HIS BLOOD

24:48.125 --> 24:50.125
IN ORDER TO BUY ME
A HUNGARIAN RED RING

24:50.125 --> 24:51.792
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
IS TOO SMALL.

24:51.792 --> 24:53.000
[SIGHS]

24:53.000 --> 24:54.917
SWEET, YES.

24:54.917 --> 24:57.458
ADORABLE, SURE.

24:57.458 --> 24:59.375
GRAMMAR SCHOOL,
DEFINITELY.

24:59.375 --> 25:02.333
HENRY NEVER
CLAIMED TO BE
THE SOPHISTICATED SORT.

25:02.333 --> 25:05.000
WHICH IS
EXACTLY MY POINT.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.667
I MEAN, WHY GO
FOR ALL THIS TROUBLE?

25:06.667 --> 25:11.291
WHY--WHY PLAN A DINNER?
WHY BUY ME JEWELRY,
IF THAT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE?

25:11.291 --> 25:14.375
MAYBE HE THINKS THAT'S
WHO YOU WANT HIM TO BE.

25:19.708 --> 25:23.500
Doug, over P.A.:
THIS IS THE CAPESIDE POLICE.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.583
WHOA, GUYS.

25:25.583 --> 25:28.375
YO, GUYS!

25:28.375 --> 25:30.750
WHAT, DID I
DO IT WRONG?

25:30.750 --> 25:32.959
HELLO?

25:46.792 --> 25:50.208
DO YOU GUYS
PARTY LIKE THIS
EVERY WEEKEND?

25:50.208 --> 25:53.333
'CAUSE I GOTTA SAY,

25:53.333 --> 25:58.792
THIS HAS BEEN
THE MOST FUN I'VE HAD
IN A REALLY LONG TIME.

25:58.792 --> 26:01.834
I MEAN, I AM JUST SO
OVER MY EX-BOYFRIEND
RIGHT NOW.

26:04.041 --> 26:08.542
[MOANS] I AM REALLY
GLAD TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT, KATE,

26:08.542 --> 26:11.917
'CAUSE I THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW.

26:11.917 --> 26:13.542
[WHISPERING]
You are not
gonna tell her

26:13.542 --> 26:14.959
in an enclosed
space.

26:14.959 --> 26:15.875
HEY, I HEARD THAT.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.208
TELL ME WHAT
IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE?

26:18.208 --> 26:20.166
HEY LOOK, I KNOW THIS
ISN'T THE OPTIMUM TIME
TO DO THIS, ALL RIGHT?

26:20.166 --> 26:22.542
BUT I...

26:22.542 --> 26:24.417
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.917
I--
OHHH...

26:26.917 --> 26:28.583
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

26:28.583 --> 26:30.458
YOU'RE NOT OVER ME,
ARE YOU, JACK?

26:30.458 --> 26:32.542
NO, NO,
TH-TH-THAT'S NOT IT.

26:32.542 --> 26:34.834
NOT TO SUGGEST
THAT YOU'RE EASILY
GET-OVERABLE

26:34.834 --> 26:37.166
OR ANYTHING, BUT...

26:37.166 --> 26:39.542
THE THING IS...I...

26:39.542 --> 26:40.542
OH, MY GOD.

26:40.542 --> 26:41.875
YOU'RE GAY, AREN'T YOU?

26:45.333 --> 26:47.208
[LAUGHS] OH, GOD!

26:48.917 --> 26:50.792
BUT WE HAD...

26:50.792 --> 26:52.458
YEAH.
YEAH, WE DID.

26:52.458 --> 26:53.875
AND YOU WERE GOOD.

26:53.875 --> 26:55.041
THANKS.

26:55.041 --> 26:56.875
BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY
HAVE ANY BEARING

26:56.875 --> 26:59.041
ON OUR CURRENT
SITUATION.

26:59.041 --> 27:00.000
I'M STILL GAY.

27:02.208 --> 27:04.417
ARE YOU GAY, TOO?

27:04.417 --> 27:07.041

27:07.041 --> 27:07.542
NO.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.792
ARE YOU SURE?

27:09.792 --> 27:11.959
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
ONLY GAY GUYS
WILL KISS ME.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.291
YOU KISSED HER?

27:15.291 --> 27:16.667
Kate: I...
[SIGHS]

27:16.667 --> 27:18.125
HE STARTED TO, BUT...

27:19.500 --> 27:23.333
MY LESS-THAN-IRON STOMACH
NAPALMED THE MOMENT.

27:23.333 --> 27:26.250
DAWSON, WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?

27:26.250 --> 27:28.583
I WASN'T.

27:28.583 --> 27:30.375
HA HA,
FOR A FLEETING MOMENT
I ACTUALLY WASN'T THINKING,

27:30.375 --> 27:32.625
AND IT FELT GOOD.

27:32.625 --> 27:36.125
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF A GIRL WHO WAS
DRUNK, VULNERABLE,

27:36.125 --> 27:37.458
AND CLEARLY
ON THE REBOUND?

27:37.458 --> 27:38.917
I MEAN, IS IT
JUST ME, DAWSON,

27:38.917 --> 27:41.083
OR IS THIS
JAW-DROPPINGLY
OUT OF CHARACTER?

27:41.083 --> 27:42.500
WHAT CHARACTER, JOEY?

27:42.500 --> 27:45.792
THE LITTLE SKETCH
IN YOUR HEAD THAT
YOU HAVE LABELED "DAWSON?"

27:45.792 --> 27:47.834
LOOK, THIS MIGHT
NOT BE THE ME THAT
YOU'RE USED TO,

27:47.834 --> 27:49.166
AND I MIGHT MAKE
A COMPLETE FOOL
OUT OF MYSELF,

27:49.166 --> 27:51.500
BUT YOU HAVE
TO START LETTING ME
MAKE SOME MISTAKES.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.458
HERE WE GO AGAIN, KIDDIES.

27:53.458 --> 27:59.375
FOR THE 476th TIME
THIS HOUR, OUR NUMBER ONE
BILLBOARD  CHART TOPPER,

27:59.375 --> 28:02.250
"THE BALLAD
OF DAWSON AND JOEY."

28:02.250 --> 28:04.500
WILL THOSE 2
CRAZY KIDS EVER GET
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?

28:04.500 --> 28:06.417
BOY, I SURE HOPE SO.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.000
LOOK, PACEY,
WOULD YOU
STAY OUT OF IT?

28:08.000 --> 28:11.375
OH, OF COURSE.
FAR BE IT FROM ME,

ON THE SANCTITY

OF THE DAWSON
AND JOEY DYNAMIC.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.500
I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST
THAT I FIND THE WAY
THAT YOU TREAT HIM

28:16.500 --> 28:18.959
SO FASCINATING, POTTER.

28:18.959 --> 28:20.291
AND HOW IS THAT,
DR. WITTER?

28:20.291 --> 28:25.458
LIKE HE'S SOME WEIRD,
NEUTERED, LITTLE
VIRGINAL CREATURE.

HUH.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.125
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

HERE TO OBSERVE
AND INTERPRET.

FOR THE SNAP, CRACKLE,

I DON'T REMEMBER IT

28:52.166 --> 28:54.291
AND IT'S NEVER
BEEN HURTFUL.

TAKEN SO SERIOUSLY.

TAKE IT SERIOUSLY,

TO DESERVE ALL THAT?

TO DESERVE THIS.

THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT SOMETIME SOON

29:29.750 --> 29:34.375
YOU COULD MAKE UP
YOUR MIND, PLEASE?

29:34.375 --> 29:37.750
YEAH, AND THE REVERENCE
THAT YOU TWO TREAT THIS
LITTLE SAGA OF YOURS WITH,

30:50.708 --> 30:53.959
HENRY, I THINK THAT
I MAY HAVE BEEN, UM...

30:53.959 --> 30:56.667
JUST A--A BIT
MORE ANXIOUS
THAN I--I LET ON

30:56.667 --> 30:58.291
ABOUT THIS
WHOLE THING.

30:58.291 --> 31:01.250
YOU? ANXIOUS,
REALLY?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.250
YEAH. UM...

31:05.500 --> 31:09.834
SEE, THE--
AT THE CHAPIN SCHOOL, UM,
VALENTINE'S WAS THE DAY

31:09.834 --> 31:12.000
WHEN THE GUY THAT
I WAS DATING WOULD

31:12.000 --> 31:15.792
TAKE OUT THE GIRL
THAT HE REALLY LIKED,

31:15.792 --> 31:17.500
GIVE HER PRESENTS,
AND CHOCOLATES--

31:17.500 --> 31:19.000
I--I DON'T
BELIEVE THAT FOR--

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
YEAH, WELL, IT'S TRUE.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.375
ALL RIGHT,
I'VE NEVER HAD A DATE
ON VALENTINE'S DAY...

31:24.375 --> 31:27.708
LET ALONE
A FIRST DATE, SO...

31:27.708 --> 31:30.875
I THINK THAT MY--
MY NEED TO FULFILL
THAT EXPERIENCE

31:30.875 --> 31:33.458
IS WHAT
GOT THE BETTER
OF BOTH OF US.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.166
THAT'S ONE WAY
TO PUT IT.

31:35.166 --> 31:36.959
[CHUCKLES]

31:38.458 --> 31:39.875
IF WE'RE GONNA
CONTINUE DATING,

31:39.875 --> 31:44.208
AND--AND I--
I'D LIKE THAT, UM,

31:44.208 --> 31:46.500
WHAT DO YOU SAY
THAT WE START ACTING
MORE LIKE OURSELVES

31:46.500 --> 31:48.250
AND LESS LIKE A COUPLE
IN OUR THIRTIES?

31:50.458 --> 31:52.500
DOES THIS MEAN YOU
WANT ME TO RETURN
THE RING?

31:52.500 --> 31:54.000
NOT ON YOUR LIFE!

31:54.000 --> 31:58.792
THIS IS THE BEST-LOOKING
HUNGARIAN RED PINKY-RING
I'VE EVER GOTTEN.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.750
AND BESIDES,
IT REMINDS ME OF YOU,

32:00.750 --> 32:03.959
WHICH MAKES IT
PRETTY INVALUABLE.

32:08.083 --> 32:09.959
MIND IF I DO?

32:12.333 --> 32:14.667
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT WE'RE DOING?

32:14.667 --> 32:17.125
WE'RE HAVING A DATE.

32:17.125 --> 32:20.625
NO FLOODS,
NO EARTHQUAKES,
NO LOCUSTS--

32:20.625 --> 32:22.750
SHH SHH SHH!

32:23.917 --> 32:26.250
LET'S JUST
NOT THINK ABOUT
WHAT COULD GO WRONG.

32:26.250 --> 32:29.875
LET'S JUST
EAT THE JELL-O.

32:30.875 --> 32:33.208
THERE'S ALWAYS
ROOM FOR JELL-O.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.250
SO YOU OK?

32:40.250 --> 32:42.291
YEAH.

32:42.291 --> 32:47.708
YA KNOW, I'M STARTING
TO REALIZE THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING KINDA COOL

32:47.708 --> 32:51.417
ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP NOT
WORKING 'CAUSE THE GUY
TURNS OUT TO BE GAY.

32:51.417 --> 32:55.959
I MEAN, SURE,
IT'S HEARTBREAKING
IN ITS OWN WAY,

32:55.959 --> 32:59.083
BUT...IT'S
NOT MY FAULT.

32:59.083 --> 33:00.583
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

33:00.583 --> 33:02.041
OF COURSE IT'S
NOT YOUR FAULT.

33:02.041 --> 33:03.750
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
EITHER.

33:03.750 --> 33:06.917
[EXHALES] I KNOW.

33:06.917 --> 33:08.625
DO YOU?

33:08.625 --> 33:09.458
WHY WERE YOU SO
AFRAID TO TELL ME?

33:09.458 --> 33:12.500
I DIDN'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU.

33:12.500 --> 33:15.542
MM-MMM. NOPE.
NOT BUYING IT.

33:15.542 --> 33:18.166
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO BETTER
THAN THAT, JACKERS.

33:18.166 --> 33:21.834
UH, HEH.
OK, UM...

33:23.834 --> 33:25.333
WHEN YOU AND I WERE
SEEING EACH OTHER,

33:25.333 --> 33:29.333
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THERE WAS SOMETHING
A LITTLE...OFF.

33:29.333 --> 33:33.125
I MEAN, I--I'VE
COME A LONG WAY,
BUT WHEN I SAW YOU,

33:33.125 --> 33:35.000
IT BROUGHT ME
BACK TO A TIME
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT

33:35.000 --> 33:37.208
THE FEELINGS THAT
I WAS HAVING WERE--
WERE WRONG,

33:37.208 --> 33:41.125
AND I GUESS
I THOUGHT THAT
IF I TOLD YOU,

33:41.125 --> 33:43.625
I'D BE SOMEHOW
DISAPPOINTING YOU.

33:43.625 --> 33:46.375
IN A MILLION YEARS
YOU COULD NEVER
DISAPPOINT ME, JACK.

33:46.375 --> 33:52.125
GAY OR STRAIGHT,
YOU'RE A WORLD-CLASS
HUMAN BEING.

33:53.625 --> 33:55.166
THAT'S WHY
I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

33:55.166 --> 33:59.542
YOU TAKE ME BACK
TO THIS NICE, SAFE PLACE

33:59.542 --> 34:02.500
WHERE CRUSHES NEVER END

34:02.500 --> 34:05.375
AND HEARTS
CAN'T BE BROKEN...

34:05.375 --> 34:07.667
AND I NEEDED THAT
THIS WEEKEND.

34:09.375 --> 34:11.875
GOOD. WELL,
I--I HOPE YOU
FOUND IT SOMEHOW.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.166
I DID.

34:14.166 --> 34:18.041
AND I'M GLAD
I GET TO GO HOME
KNOWING THE REAL YOU.

34:19.625 --> 34:20.917
COME HERE.

34:36.833 --> 34:40.250
THOUGHT THE SILENT
TREATMENT WAS A TACTIC
TYPICALLY EMPLOYED BY KIDS.

34:40.250 --> 34:43.333
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
THE SILENT TREATMENT.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.542
YOU'RE NOT TALKIN'
TO ME, EITHER.

34:45.542 --> 34:46.583
I WAS THINKING.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.792
ABOUT WHAT?

34:47.792 --> 34:48.958
MY SON.

34:48.958 --> 34:52.417
IT'S BEEN QUITE
A YEAR FOR YA.

34:52.417 --> 34:54.417
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34:54.417 --> 34:58.542
WELL, IT ALL STARTED OUT
WITH A WRECKED BOAT
AND A WILD PARTY.

34:58.542 --> 34:59.917
AND I WAS ANGRY.

34:59.917 --> 35:01.625
DAD--

35:03.291 --> 35:07.166
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO
IS GET BACK TO THE BASICS
OF BEING A KID.

35:07.166 --> 35:08.750
I MEAN--

35:08.750 --> 35:10.583
I'M 16,
AND IT WAS A PARTY,

35:10.583 --> 35:12.917
AND THOSE 2 THINGS
ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED.

35:12.917 --> 35:15.041
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH YOU GOING TO
PARTIES.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.583
I HAVE ZERO PROBLEM
WITH YOU BEING 16.

35:16.583 --> 35:20.000
I DO, I ADMIT,
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH,
OH, WRECKED BOATS,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.959
STRIPPERS
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE,

35:22.959 --> 35:26.750
AND FISHING YOU OUT
OF THE DRUNK TANK
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.291
FAIR ENOUGH.
BUT CAN YOU, UH...

35:29.291 --> 35:32.792
CHALK IT UP TO
YOUTHFUL EXUBERANCE?

35:32.792 --> 35:35.417
YES, I CAN.

35:35.417 --> 35:36.917
DAD...THANK YOU.

35:36.917 --> 35:38.959
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

35:38.959 --> 35:42.125
I'M NOT FINISHED.
SINCE YOU'VE
SUDDENLY DECIDED

35:42.125 --> 35:44.250
TO START ACTING
LIKE A KID,

35:44.250 --> 35:47.125
I GUESS I'M LEFT
WITH NO CHOICE BUT
TO START ACTING...

35:47.125 --> 35:48.708
LIKE A PARENT.

35:48.708 --> 35:51.792
AND UNTIL YOU DECIDE
ON A PATH FOR YOURSELF,
I'VE CHOSEN ONE FOR YA.

35:51.792 --> 35:52.917
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

35:52.917 --> 35:55.208
YOUR MOTHER'S PLANNING
ON BUYING A RESTAURANT.

35:55.208 --> 35:56.792
REALLY?

35:56.792 --> 35:58.166
AND YOU'RE GONNA
WORK THERE,

35:58.166 --> 35:59.417
DOING WHATEVER
SHE NEEDS YOU TO DO,

35:59.417 --> 36:02.375
AFTER SCHOOL,
EVENINGS, WEEKENDS,
WHATEVER,

36:02.375 --> 36:04.500
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS
UNTIL YOU BEGIN
TO UNDERSTAND

36:04.500 --> 36:06.291
THAT SUDDENLY DECIDING
TO BE A KID

36:06.291 --> 36:08.875
DOESN'T GIVE YOU LICENSE
TO BE RECKLESS...

36:08.875 --> 36:11.000
AND IRRESPONSIBLE.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.875
GOOD NIGHT, SON.

36:22.959 --> 36:24.500
AHEM.

36:24.500 --> 36:27.875
YOU WERE IN
RARE FORM TONIGHT.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.750
HOW BAD DO I SUCK,
HUH?

36:31.750 --> 36:34.625
SO WHAT SEEMS
TO BE THE PROBLEM?

36:36.166 --> 36:37.750
THERE'S NO PROBLEM,
DOUGIE.

36:37.750 --> 36:40.291
OH, COME ON, PACEY,
I FOUND YOU HANGING
FROM A TREE

36:40.291 --> 36:41.375
GETTING COMPLETELY
WASTED.

36:41.375 --> 36:45.166
HUH? SO WHAT IS IT,
A GIRL OR SOMETHING?

36:45.166 --> 36:47.500
WHAT? TCH.

36:47.500 --> 36:50.834
OK. SO IT'S A GIRL.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.083
WHO IS SHE?

36:52.083 --> 36:54.667
[SIGHS] YOU KNOW WHAT,
DOUGIE?

36:54.667 --> 36:57.166
IT'S REALLY NOT
THAT IMPORTANT, OK?

36:57.166 --> 36:57.542
OK.

37:01.208 --> 37:02.875
TELL YOU SOMETHING,
THOUGH.

37:02.875 --> 37:04.250
SHE'S REALLY,
REALLY ANNOYING.

37:04.250 --> 37:05.208
YEAH?

37:05.208 --> 37:07.291
YEAH. I MEAN,
THIS GIRL IS AMAZING.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.417
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE
SUBJECT ON THE FACE
OF THE PLANET

37:09.417 --> 37:12.041
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
AN OPINION ABOUT.
IT'S MIND-BOGGLING.

37:12.041 --> 37:14.208
WELL, THAT CERTAINLY
SOUNDS LIKE
A NIGHTMARE.

37:14.208 --> 37:16.542
NO, I MEAN--IT'S NOT
QUITE LIKE THAT.

37:16.542 --> 37:19.417
I MEAN,
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND THAT
THE GIRL'S REALLY SMART,

37:19.417 --> 37:21.041
SO SHE'S USUALLY RIGHT,

37:21.041 --> 37:24.333
AND WHEN SHE ARGUES,
IT COMES FROM THIS REALLY
BEAUTIFUL, PURE PLACE,

37:24.333 --> 37:26.375
SO HOW CAN YOU FIGHT
AGAINST THAT?

37:26.375 --> 37:27.875
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE
A SMART-ASS LIKE ME.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.333
IS SHE PRETTY?

37:33.250 --> 37:36.458
YEAH. SHE IS...PRETTY.

37:36.458 --> 37:40.333
SHE IS VERY, VERY PRETTY.

37:43.083 --> 37:45.583
SHE'S ACTUALLY THE...

37:45.583 --> 37:48.875
THAT KINDA PRETTY
THAT GIVES YOU BUTTERFLIES,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

37:48.875 --> 37:50.291
UH...YEAH.

37:50.291 --> 37:54.291
NEVER LOSE
THE BUTTERFLIES.

37:55.333 --> 37:56.708
WHAT?

37:56.708 --> 37:59.750
YOU KNOW, THAT'S MAYBE
WHAT SUCKS MOST ABOUT
GETTING OLDER.

37:59.750 --> 38:01.792
SOMEWHERE ALONG
THE LINE, YOU JUST...

38:01.792 --> 38:03.917
LOSE THE BUTTERFLIES.

38:03.917 --> 38:05.959
SO THE QUESTION IS,
LITTLE BROTHER,

38:05.959 --> 38:08.291
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT IT?

38:08.291 --> 38:09.333
DO?

38:09.333 --> 38:11.417
YEAH, DO, AS IN
DO SOMETHING.

38:11.417 --> 38:12.583
TAKE ACTION.

38:12.583 --> 38:13.875
NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE REALLY...

38:13.875 --> 38:17.458
PROPERLY GRASPING
THE GRAVITY OF THE
SITUATION, DOUGIE.

38:17.458 --> 38:20.291
YOU SEE,
IF I WAS ACTUALLY TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS,

38:20.291 --> 38:23.625
THERE IS THE STRONG POSSIBILITY
THAT THE SUN WOULD
CEASE TO SHINE.

38:23.625 --> 38:25.500
THE TIDES WOULD CEASE TO RISE.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.750
IN FACT, I'M BETTING
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE

38:27.750 --> 38:29.667
THAT THE VERY EARTH
WOULD CRACK OPEN

38:29.667 --> 38:32.708
AND CAPESIDE WOULD BECOME
HOME TO A HUGE HELLMOUTH

38:32.708 --> 38:36.667
THAT WOULD SPEW FORTH
ENDLESS HORDES OF
MONSTERS AND DEMONS

38:36.667 --> 38:38.959
THAT WOULD CHOKE
THE DENIZENS OF THE CITY,

38:38.959 --> 38:41.125
MAKING THEM FALL
TO THEIR KNEES

38:41.125 --> 38:44.583
AND PRAY FOR A RETURN
TO THE DAYS BEFORE
I TOOK ACTION.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.750
THAT'S REALLY WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.291
HUH.

38:49.291 --> 38:50.959
YEAH, MAYBE...

38:54.583 --> 38:57.291
LOOK, PACEY, UH...
AHEM.

38:58.291 --> 38:59.834
IN MY EXPERIENCE,

38:59.834 --> 39:02.000
YOU DON'T COME ACROSS
THAT MANY PEOPLE

39:02.000 --> 39:03.917
WITH THE ABILITY
TO GIVE YOU BUTTERFLIES.

39:03.917 --> 39:07.000
YOU JUST DON'T.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.500
AND IF YOU DON'T
TELL THIS GIRL
HOW YOU FEEL,

39:10.500 --> 39:13.458
WELL, IT'LL BE LIKE
SPENDING THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE

39:13.458 --> 39:14.500
IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL
PRISON.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.000
HEY, DOUG?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.625
YEAH.

39:20.625 --> 39:23.208
THANK YOU.

40:09.083 --> 40:11.750
WAIT, HOLD ON, PLEASE?

40:11.750 --> 40:12.750
JUST--

40:16.667 --> 40:20.708
WHAT I SAID LAST NIGHT
WAS WAY OUTTA LINE.

40:20.708 --> 40:23.834
AND...YES, I WAS DRUNK,

40:23.834 --> 40:27.583
BUT...MORE TO THE POINT,
I WAS JUST PLAIN WRONG.

40:27.583 --> 40:31.417
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M REALLY SORRY.

40:32.917 --> 40:35.458
WELL...

40:35.458 --> 40:38.083
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, TOO,
PACEY.

40:39.750 --> 40:40.708
ME?

40:42.125 --> 40:43.458
WHY?

40:45.000 --> 40:46.834
WELL...

40:48.500 --> 40:50.125
BECAUSE, I MEAN,

40:50.125 --> 40:53.708
SATAN HIMSELF COULD LEAD
DAWSON INTO THE FIERY
PITS OF HELL,

40:53.708 --> 40:56.750
AND HE WOULD STILL EMERGE
WITH HIS MORAL CODE
FIRMLY INTACT.

40:56.750 --> 40:57.542
BUT YOU...

41:01.542 --> 41:03.583
MAYBE I THINK THAT...

41:03.583 --> 41:06.083
NOBODY'S WORRYING
ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.250
SO, THEN...AHEM.

41:11.250 --> 41:13.750
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY
SAYING, THEN,
IS THAT...

41:13.750 --> 41:16.458
GIVEN THE HIGHLY
DYSFUNCTIONAL NATURE
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP,

41:16.458 --> 41:19.458
THIS IS ACTUALLY
HOW YOU EXPRESS
CONCERN FOR ME.

41:19.458 --> 41:22.333
YOU GOTTA LEARN TO READ
BETWEEN THE BANTER, PACEY.

41:24.959 --> 41:26.375
RIGHT.

41:34.375 --> 41:35.959
SO...

41:35.959 --> 41:38.333
SO ARE WE
ALL FINISHED HERE?

41:38.333 --> 41:40.041
NO.

41:40.041 --> 41:41.458
ACTUALLY. UM...

41:41.458 --> 41:44.333
THERE'S SOMETHING
ELSE.

41:44.333 --> 41:46.750
SOMETHING ELSE?

41:48.500 --> 41:49.750
YEAH.

41:51.834 --> 41:54.083
IT'S--IT'S JUST
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TELL YOU.

41:54.083 --> 41:57.708
UH...

41:59.834 --> 42:01.500
LOOK, UH...

42:03.917 --> 42:05.333
JOEY...

42:10.000 --> 42:11.834
YOU'RE LINGERING
ON YOUR CLUTCH, OK?

42:11.834 --> 42:13.959
I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU'RE JUST EASING
INTO THE GEAR,

42:13.959 --> 42:16.291
BUT...IT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

42:16.291 --> 42:18.250
MAYBE NOT TODAY
AND MAYBE NOT
TOMORROW,

42:18.250 --> 42:20.041
BUT SOON YOU'RE GONNA
DO A LOTTA DAMAGE
TO YOUR TRANSMISSION,

42:20.041 --> 42:23.125
SO WHAT I WAS THINKING
IF THAT IF YOU WANTED
TO, I COULD SHOW YA.

42:23.125 --> 42:25.166
NOW?

42:26.875 --> 42:27.959
YEAH.

42:27.959 --> 42:29.708
YEAH. HA.

42:29.708 --> 42:31.458
OK, PACEY.

42:31.458 --> 42:31.708
OK.

42:35.083 --> 42:36.125
