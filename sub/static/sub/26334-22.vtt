WEBVTT

00:03.977 --> 00:05.989
First, I want to say thank you
for coming down.

00:05.990 --> 00:09.658
I know it's not easy making time
in your busy day to help us.

00:09.727 --> 00:11.893
My pleasure. I'm happy to help.

00:11.962 --> 00:14.029
Well, before we take this
to the grand jury,

00:14.098 --> 00:16.231
I just want
to go through a few things.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.066
- No problem.
- So you were present

00:18.135 --> 00:22.537
at the location on the evening
of May 1, is that correct?

00:22.606 --> 00:23.905
Says you witnessed
the shooting.

00:23.974 --> 00:26.241
No. I heard a gunshot,
and I look around the corner,

00:26.310 --> 00:28.110
I saw a guy dead
on the sidewalk.

00:29.513 --> 00:32.147
Um... "I saw a man

00:32.216 --> 00:34.349
"about six feet tall
wearing jeans and a hoodie

00:34.385 --> 00:36.518
shoot the guy, and then
run toward the subway."

00:36.587 --> 00:39.254
That's the statement you gave
to the officer at the scene.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.789
I never said that.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.760
So what <i>did</i> you say?

00:44.828 --> 00:46.094
I said I heard shots,

00:46.163 --> 00:48.530
and then I saw a guy dead
on the sidewalk,

00:48.599 --> 00:50.799
and that I saw a guy
running away.

00:50.868 --> 00:53.301
And was the guy about six foot,
wearing a hoodie and jeans?

00:53.370 --> 00:55.103
He was too far away to tell.

00:55.172 --> 00:56.172
Did you see a gun?

00:56.240 --> 00:57.906
No. Just a guy
running to the train.

01:00.730 --> 01:03.631
Mr. Morris,
if I can ask you a question?

01:03.700 --> 01:06.100
Is it possible
that someone threatened you

01:06.169 --> 01:07.501
to change your testimony?

01:07.570 --> 01:09.009
No. No way.

01:09.010 --> 01:11.944
So the officer that took your
statement just got it wrong?

01:12.013 --> 01:13.112
That's right.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.316
Well, I'm gonna
get the officer down here

01:17.385 --> 01:19.530
and get to the bottom of this,
but if you have anything

01:19.554 --> 01:22.922
you need to clarify,
right now would be the time.

01:22.990 --> 01:24.623
I'm good.

01:24.692 --> 01:26.659
Okay. Well, thank you
for coming down.

01:29.864 --> 01:32.198
All right, get him
down here, Anthony.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.966
Her.

01:34.358 --> 01:35.424
So get <i>her</i> down here.

01:35.492 --> 01:37.926
Officer Edit Janko.

01:42.658 --> 01:45.377
It's P-I-E-C-E,
not P-E-A-C-E.

01:45.378 --> 01:47.946
No, it's "peace," like
"object to this marriage,

01:48.014 --> 01:49.881
or forever hold your peace."

01:49.950 --> 01:51.916
It's piece with the "I-E,"

01:51.985 --> 01:54.085
meaning your opinion is
the piece of the puzzle

01:54.154 --> 01:55.353
that makes it whole.

01:55.422 --> 01:56.721
You've said your piece.

01:56.790 --> 01:58.323
Oh, so it's like in church.

01:58.391 --> 02:01.392
"Piece be with you."
P-I-E-C-E.

02:01.461 --> 02:03.628
Yeah. Exactly.

02:05.498 --> 02:07.532
Well...

02:09.703 --> 02:10.881
...getting recognition
from the community...

02:10.882 --> 02:11.704
Good morning.

02:11.705 --> 02:12.870
Morning.

02:12.939 --> 02:14.606
Are we late?

02:14.674 --> 02:16.941
No. Baker's just going
over the new ideas

02:17.010 --> 02:19.777
for the social media
Crime Stoppers program.

02:19.846 --> 02:21.779
Was she?

02:21.848 --> 02:24.849
Boy, there's some good stuff
in there.

02:24.918 --> 02:26.284
Good work, guys.

02:26.353 --> 02:27.819
That's great.

02:27.887 --> 02:31.856
Well, we really need
to kick it around some more.

02:33.193 --> 02:34.525
Well, you know what?

02:34.594 --> 02:36.127
This is the perfect time.

02:36.196 --> 02:37.695
We could do the briefing later.

02:37.764 --> 02:38.896
I am jammed up.

02:38.965 --> 02:40.665
I have to write a speech.

02:40.734 --> 02:41.966
Open with a joke.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.916 --> 02:59.951
So, the big day is coming up.
You nervous?

03:00.020 --> 03:01.853
Absolutely terrified.

03:03.256 --> 03:04.256
And excited.

03:04.324 --> 03:05.724
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

03:05.759 --> 03:07.191
You're gonna be
a beautiful bride,

03:07.260 --> 03:08.926
and my brother is a lucky guy.

03:08.995 --> 03:10.928
Oh. Thanks.

03:12.165 --> 03:15.833
So, Eddie, the reason
I asked you down here

03:15.902 --> 03:18.436
is to help clear up
some confusion

03:18.505 --> 03:20.438
we have on the Morales murder.

03:20.507 --> 03:21.839
Okay. Uh, what's up?

03:21.908 --> 03:23.841
Well, in your report, you say

03:23.910 --> 03:26.678
Leo Morris witnessed
the shooting

03:26.746 --> 03:30.448
and gave a physical description
on the shooter.

03:30.517 --> 03:32.717
- That's right.
- Well, he says it's wrong.

03:34.187 --> 03:35.553
He says it's not true.

03:35.622 --> 03:37.288
That is 100% true.

03:37.357 --> 03:40.224
Well, one of you is
either mistaken or lying.

03:40.293 --> 03:43.094
Lying?

03:43.163 --> 03:45.730
Well... poor choice of words.

03:45.799 --> 03:47.732
What I mean is...

03:47.801 --> 03:50.101
What you mean is
you are taking the word

03:50.170 --> 03:52.370
of a complete stranger
over mine.

03:55.108 --> 03:56.974
Eddie, when I'm in this office,

03:57.043 --> 03:59.377
I only take one side--
the truth.

03:59.446 --> 04:02.046
Well, did you ask <i>him</i>
if he was lying?

04:02.115 --> 04:03.514
Matter of fact, I did.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.450
And he was quite convincing,
wasn't he?

04:08.555 --> 04:12.123
So... what?
Am I <i>not</i> convincing?

04:12.192 --> 04:13.324
That's not what I'm saying.

04:13.393 --> 04:15.493
That's kind of
what you're saying.

04:17.497 --> 04:20.832
What I wrote
in the report is exactly

04:20.899 --> 04:24.836
what Leo Morris stated to me
when I arrived on the scene.

04:24.904 --> 04:26.838
If he's saying
something different today,

04:26.906 --> 04:29.507
then he's the liar, not me.

04:29.576 --> 04:30.608
Eddie...

04:30.677 --> 04:32.877
I'm-a go back to work.

04:34.848 --> 04:36.848
Something
I almost never say to you.

04:37.917 --> 04:40.051
Should have let me handle it.

04:45.358 --> 04:47.258
So no roommate?
What about a girlfriend?

04:47.327 --> 04:49.660
I don't know.
I don't think so.

04:49.729 --> 04:51.362
Was he with anyone
last night?

04:51.431 --> 04:53.064
I don't know.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.499
I don't watch the door.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.501
But you have
security cameras, right?

04:56.569 --> 04:58.703
Surveillance camera
at the front entrance.

04:58.772 --> 05:00.538
Okay, well, we're gonna
need that footage.

05:00.607 --> 05:01.939
No.

05:02.008 --> 05:04.108
We're gonna need
to see that footage ASAP.

05:04.177 --> 05:05.309
You got something?

05:05.378 --> 05:06.611
Mm-hmm.

05:06.679 --> 05:08.613
He definitely had
a visitor last night.

05:17.791 --> 05:21.791
<b><font color="#00FF00">♪ Blue Bloods 9x22 ♪</font></b>

05:36.789 --> 05:38.055
Come in.

05:40.909 --> 05:42.842
Look, I can explain.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.080
I hope so.

05:47.149 --> 05:49.883
Sid, Baker wants
you to join us

05:49.951 --> 05:52.051
in my office.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.921
Don't you think it's better
we're all on the same page?

05:54.990 --> 05:56.267
Obviously, you're both
pissed at me.

05:56.291 --> 05:57.724
We're all part of
his inner circle,

05:57.792 --> 06:01.761
we all have access to him at any
time, but this is about policy.

06:01.830 --> 06:03.229
I know that.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.599
Chain of command.

06:06.668 --> 06:08.708
- Excuse me?
- I'm a lieutenant, you're a detective.

06:08.737 --> 06:10.003
Chain of command.

06:10.071 --> 06:12.906
Anything you run past the boss
got to first be cleared by me.

06:12.974 --> 06:14.908
Sid, it needs
to be cleared by me.

06:14.976 --> 06:16.776
No disrespect, Garrett,
but you're a civilian.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.011
Here we go again.

06:18.079 --> 06:19.157
Well, technically,
he's right, Garrett.

06:19.181 --> 06:20.880
Commissioner Moore
for right now.

06:20.949 --> 06:22.693
- Yes, Commissioner Moore.
- You really think

06:22.717 --> 06:23.917
that he's technically right?

06:23.985 --> 06:25.285
- Yes.
- A thousand percent.

06:25.353 --> 06:26.886
I suggest you both take a look

06:26.955 --> 06:28.688
at the Patrol
Guide because,

06:28.757 --> 06:30.290
as deputy commissioner,

06:30.358 --> 06:32.825
I hold the assimilated
rank of a three-star chief.

06:32.894 --> 06:35.195
- Seriously?
- Thousand percent.

06:35.263 --> 06:36.941
And technically, you're both
supposed to salute me.

06:36.965 --> 06:38.031
Fat chance.

06:38.099 --> 06:39.832
Chain of command,
just like you said.

06:39.901 --> 06:41.901
You report to him.

06:41.970 --> 06:43.036
You report to me.

06:43.104 --> 06:44.304
I don't know, Garrett.

06:44.372 --> 06:45.939
I work with you,
I report to the boss.

06:46.007 --> 06:48.208
As do I, and the only reason

06:48.276 --> 06:50.777
I showed the commissioner
my presentation was because

06:50.845 --> 06:54.581
he saw me working on it,
and <i>he</i> asked to see it.

06:54.649 --> 06:56.916
This office needs to
speak with one voice.

06:56.985 --> 06:59.786
We can't have things flying in
from all different directions.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.621
That's why before
anything lands

07:01.690 --> 07:02.956
on his desk,

07:03.024 --> 07:04.557
it has to be vetted first by me.

07:04.626 --> 07:06.492
- And me.
- You know what?

07:06.561 --> 07:08.294
I don't think
this has anything to do

07:08.363 --> 07:10.296
with chain of command.
I think this is

07:10.365 --> 07:12.865
bruised egos
and stepped-on toes.

07:14.402 --> 07:15.635
Let's run through it.

07:15.704 --> 07:17.503
Uh, just pretend
you're my sister.

07:20.742 --> 07:22.642
Well, you don't have
probable cause, Danny.

07:24.479 --> 07:27.413
And I'm not your rubber stamp.

07:28.650 --> 07:30.583
Meant figuratively,
not literally.

07:30.652 --> 07:32.986
But that was very funny, and...

07:33.054 --> 07:34.454
very accurate.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.623
Okay, so,
some time after 11:00,

07:36.691 --> 07:39.626
Patrick Harris and Rachel Wilson
have drinks together

07:39.694 --> 07:41.394
at a place called
"the Moomba Room."

07:42.497 --> 07:44.697
Now, at 0117 hours,

07:44.766 --> 07:46.466
we got an Uber charge here

07:46.534 --> 07:49.602
on Patrick's account taking him
from the bar to his apartment.

07:49.671 --> 07:51.604
At 142 hours,

07:51.673 --> 07:54.307
they arrive at Patrick's
place of residence.

07:57.078 --> 07:59.979
Now only two people
enter the building after them.

08:00.048 --> 08:01.614
They're both confirmed
as residents.

08:01.683 --> 08:03.116
There's no signs
of forced entry,

08:03.184 --> 08:06.286
so we know
it wasn't them, but...

08:06.354 --> 08:10.556
Rachel leaves the building
somewhere after 5:00.

08:10.625 --> 08:14.327
M.E. puts the time of death
between 4:30 and 5:30 a.m.

08:14.396 --> 08:16.396
Surveillance footage
doesn't show anyone else

08:16.464 --> 08:19.098
enter the building until after
Patrick's body is discovered,

08:19.167 --> 08:21.200
which means, there's only
one person on Earth

08:21.269 --> 08:23.002
who could have killed
Patrick Harris.

08:24.773 --> 08:25.972
Rachel Wilson.

08:26.041 --> 08:28.875
So, sis,
do I get a warrant or not?

08:30.512 --> 08:33.145
It's good, Danny Boy,
but it's not good enough.

08:33.214 --> 08:37.250
Of course, because nothing's
ever good enough for you, sis.

08:37.318 --> 08:38.429
More than good
enough for me.

08:38.453 --> 08:39.530
Detectives, I'm sorry.

08:39.532 --> 08:42.188
- This is...
- Patrick Harris's mother. Can we talk?

08:45.560 --> 08:48.761
They broke up over a year ago,
but she just couldn't accept it.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.196
She wouldn't leave him alone.

08:50.265 --> 08:52.498
Well, the video of them walking
into his apartment--

08:52.567 --> 08:55.101
they sure looked happy.

08:55.170 --> 08:56.869
He didn't look bothered
to be with her.

08:56.938 --> 08:58.037
So why would she kill him?

08:58.106 --> 09:00.106
My guess?

09:00.175 --> 09:02.709
He told her
that this was a one-time thing.

09:02.777 --> 09:04.043
But kill him?

09:04.112 --> 09:06.713
She looks like a sweet,
innocent little thing

09:06.781 --> 09:08.621
with all those stuffed animals,
but believe me,

09:08.683 --> 09:12.251
she's got a temper,
and a history of this.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.153
What type of history
are you talking about?

09:14.222 --> 09:15.621
When they broke up,

09:15.690 --> 09:18.891
first, she threatened
to kill herself

09:18.960 --> 09:20.860
if he didn't take her back.

09:20.929 --> 09:22.395
And when that didn't work,

09:22.464 --> 09:24.530
she threatened to hurt
anyone else he was with.

09:24.599 --> 09:28.801
And when all of that
failed to lure him back,

09:28.870 --> 09:31.170
that's when she showed
her true colors.

09:31.239 --> 09:33.239
What do you mean,
her true colors?

09:39.547 --> 09:41.347
"If I can't have
you, nobody can."

09:41.416 --> 09:43.816
"If you won't be with
me in this lifetime,

09:43.885 --> 09:47.587
then you will be with me
in the next lifetime."

09:50.525 --> 09:52.658
She called me a liar.

09:52.727 --> 09:55.228
Well, not exactly, right?

09:55.296 --> 09:57.296
She said, "One
of you is lying."

09:57.365 --> 09:59.298
Okay, look, I understand
that you're upset.

09:59.367 --> 10:02.001
I'm just clarifying, she didn't
actually call you a liar.

10:02.070 --> 10:05.505
She said, "Someone is
lying," and then she said

10:05.573 --> 10:07.407
the witness seemed credible.

10:07.475 --> 10:08.875
You do the math.

10:08.943 --> 10:10.583
Okay, I just think
that we should drop it,

10:10.645 --> 10:11.989
because I don't think
there's any upside

10:12.013 --> 10:13.157
to splitting hairs
about this.

10:13.181 --> 10:14.781
Okay.

10:14.849 --> 10:17.483
Look, I'm just surprised,
because it doesn't sound

10:17.552 --> 10:19.352
like something
that my sister would do.

10:19.421 --> 10:22.321
Well, maybe not to you, but
she is very intimidating.

10:22.390 --> 10:24.402
This is great. You know,
we're about to get married,

10:24.426 --> 10:25.591
and I'm just now finding out

10:25.660 --> 10:27.260
that you have a problem
with my sister.

10:27.328 --> 10:29.996
Of course I have a
problem with your sister.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.330
She's smart,

10:31.399 --> 10:33.166
she's confident,
she's accomplished,

10:33.234 --> 10:34.245
she's ridiculously beautiful.

10:34.269 --> 10:36.135
She is every woman's
basic nightmare.

10:36.204 --> 10:38.182
Do you think that <i>you're</i>
every woman's basic nightmare?

10:38.206 --> 10:39.472
How could I be?

10:39.541 --> 10:41.941
Because as far as I'm concerned,
you just described yourself.

10:43.578 --> 10:45.511
- Ha ha.
- It's the truth.

10:45.580 --> 10:47.780
Jamie.

10:53.521 --> 10:55.455
He's in a meeting.
We'll get right back to you.

10:55.523 --> 10:57.457
Thanks.

10:58.526 --> 11:01.093
That's funny.

11:01.162 --> 11:03.095
Sorry, I got to run.

11:06.968 --> 11:08.901
Come in.

11:10.338 --> 11:11.637
You know...

11:12.974 --> 11:15.274
Why didn't I have you write
the damn speech?

11:15.343 --> 11:17.276
It's a rehearsal dinner.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.011
You're making a
toast, not a speech.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.113
Just write from the heart.

11:21.182 --> 11:23.282
But start with a joke.

11:24.385 --> 11:25.852
You guys get your head together

11:25.920 --> 11:27.320
on that Crime Stoppers thing?

11:27.388 --> 11:29.288
Not yet. Top of the list.

11:29.357 --> 11:32.525
Did you see the big
drop in violent crime

11:32.594 --> 11:33.926
out in Crown Heights?

11:33.995 --> 11:35.728
It's time for a victory lap.

11:35.797 --> 11:37.864
- It is?
- It is.

11:37.932 --> 11:40.666
Our community policing effort
is the reason for the drop.

11:40.735 --> 11:42.602
We got to get that
message out there

11:42.670 --> 11:44.348
to encourage other
neighborhoods to be receptive

11:44.372 --> 11:45.505
to our program.

11:45.573 --> 11:47.306
Okay. What'd Sid say?

11:48.409 --> 11:50.076
Well, I-I didn't
discuss it with him.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.677
This is a public
relations matter.

11:51.746 --> 11:53.145
Garrett.

11:53.214 --> 11:55.214
I mean, you know
he's gonna have an opinion

11:55.283 --> 11:57.083
on what precincts we go to.

11:57.151 --> 12:00.019
Sure. I'll loop him
in on that aspect.

12:00.088 --> 12:01.854
Get him to make a list for me.

12:01.923 --> 12:03.756
Yeah. And, of course, Abigail.

12:03.825 --> 12:05.558
Abigail.

12:06.628 --> 12:08.394
Well, excuse me?

12:08.463 --> 12:09.996
She does my schedule.

12:10.064 --> 12:11.864
I'm not sure I'll even have time

12:11.933 --> 12:14.267
to do something like this
for a couple of weeks.

12:14.335 --> 12:18.070
So you're saying I have to get
Gormley and Baker's sign-off

12:18.139 --> 12:20.206
before I can set this in motion?

12:21.309 --> 12:23.109
I didn't say you had to.

12:23.144 --> 12:26.512
You're ordering me to vet
my idea with them first.

12:27.615 --> 12:30.483
Is there something
you need to tell me?

12:32.587 --> 12:34.220
No.

12:34.289 --> 12:36.989
It's fine.

12:38.660 --> 12:40.593
You're right.

12:41.696 --> 12:43.029
Great.

12:44.132 --> 12:45.665
I'll, uh...

12:45.733 --> 12:47.233
I'll-I'll get their thoughts.

13:07.822 --> 13:09.555
This is you, correct?

13:09.624 --> 13:11.657
- Yes.
- You mind

13:11.726 --> 13:12.970
telling us what happened
last night?

13:12.994 --> 13:14.393
We hung out.

13:14.462 --> 13:15.928
Is he your boyfriend?

13:15.997 --> 13:17.430
Well, kind of.

13:17.498 --> 13:21.267
We broke up a year ago,
but... we're soul mates.

13:21.336 --> 13:22.668
Uh-huh.

13:22.737 --> 13:25.938
So, last night was
make-up sex. Then what?

13:27.909 --> 13:29.508
Then what, Rachel?

13:29.577 --> 13:31.444
We slept a little, and then...

13:31.512 --> 13:33.646
I got up to go to work.
I have to be here at 5:00.

13:33.715 --> 13:35.514
And Patrick was
alive at that time?

13:35.583 --> 13:37.984
Oh, my God. Are you saying...?

13:38.052 --> 13:39.118
Mm-hmm.

13:39.187 --> 13:40.786
No.

13:40.855 --> 13:42.622
H-How?

13:42.690 --> 13:45.424
That's what we were hoping
you could help us with.

13:45.493 --> 13:46.792
Wait.

13:48.429 --> 13:50.229
No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:50.298 --> 13:53.833
No, I had absolutely nothing
to do with this.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.146
Well, then maybe you wouldn't
mind coming down to our office

13:56.170 --> 13:58.337
so we can rule you
out as a suspect.

13:58.406 --> 14:00.339
Suspect?

14:00.408 --> 14:01.273
Mm-hmm.

14:01.342 --> 14:02.475
Suspect?!

14:02.543 --> 14:04.543
Yeah, we'll just take
some elimination prints,

14:04.612 --> 14:07.847
a little DNA sample, and
you should be in the clear.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.049
I think
I should call my parents.

14:10.118 --> 14:11.517
And their lawyer.

14:11.586 --> 14:13.030
But you said you didn't
do anything, remember?

14:13.054 --> 14:14.987
I'm sorry.
I can't say another word.

14:23.260 --> 14:24.960
Thank you.

14:25.028 --> 14:28.063
Hey. What are you doing
in my neck of the woods?

14:28.132 --> 14:29.564
I just testified.

14:29.633 --> 14:31.933
- So, I spoke to Dad earlier.
- Yeah?

14:32.002 --> 14:34.636
Think he's really nervous
about delivering his speech.

14:34.705 --> 14:36.271
The guy delivers
five speeches a day.

14:36.340 --> 14:40.809
Not to his baby boy at his
rehearsal dinner, he doesn't.

14:40.878 --> 14:43.945
Think it's really sweet
that you asked him.

14:46.016 --> 14:48.884
So, what else is going on?

14:48.952 --> 14:50.719
Eddie told me you had her in.

14:50.787 --> 14:51.787
Uh-huh.

14:51.822 --> 14:52.921
That go okay?

14:52.990 --> 14:54.356
Went fine for me.

14:55.659 --> 14:56.858
Apparently not for her.

14:57.961 --> 14:59.461
I think she was hurt.

14:59.530 --> 15:02.063
Look, you think we should
be talking about this?

15:02.132 --> 15:03.565
Why not?

15:03.634 --> 15:06.801
When she's in my
office, she's a cop.

15:06.870 --> 15:08.837
And if I find discrepancies,

15:08.906 --> 15:11.151
then you better believe I'm
gonna get to the bottom of it.

15:11.175 --> 15:13.074
And if she can't
handle that,

15:13.143 --> 15:15.777
maybe she should find
a softer line of work.

15:15.846 --> 15:18.246
You sure this isn't
about something else?

15:18.315 --> 15:21.082
Like, maybe you're not
her biggest fan or...?

15:21.151 --> 15:23.185
Don't bring me into
your fiancée's dramas.

15:23.253 --> 15:26.154
- Okay? I like her just fine.
- "Like her just fine."

15:26.223 --> 15:28.523
Yeah. And I'll like her
a hell of a lot more

15:28.592 --> 15:31.393
when she starts fighting
her own battles.

15:34.932 --> 15:36.865
<i>Look,</i>

15:36.934 --> 15:38.411
short of her walking in here
and confessing,

15:38.435 --> 15:40.035
I don't know
what more we could do.

15:40.103 --> 15:42.270
- I see one thing.
- What?

15:42.339 --> 15:44.573
If her fingerprints
are on that knife...

15:44.641 --> 15:46.274
Well, she has no priors.

15:46.343 --> 15:48.023
She has no
prints in the system.

15:48.078 --> 15:50.078
True. But her fingerprints
are out there somewhere.

15:50.147 --> 15:51.947
And what makes you think that?

15:52.015 --> 15:53.548
You remember at her office.

15:53.617 --> 15:56.651
Every door was locked
with a palm print sensor.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.187
So her prints <i>are</i> on file.

15:59.256 --> 16:01.156
And that's something
we can get a subpoena for,

16:01.225 --> 16:02.936
and we don't have to get it
from your sister.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.426
Hmm.

16:12.469 --> 16:14.236
Garrett and Gormley.

16:14.304 --> 16:15.804
Let's have 'em.

16:20.244 --> 16:21.309
You, too, Baker.

16:31.154 --> 16:35.390
So, anything I need to know?

16:40.097 --> 16:42.030
Okay.

16:42.099 --> 16:44.032
All three of you are fired.

16:48.739 --> 16:51.506
If my inner circle
can't collaborate,

16:51.575 --> 16:54.342
I will find people who can.

16:54.411 --> 16:57.846
Personal feuds cannot have
a place in this building.

17:02.819 --> 17:05.353
Now...

17:05.422 --> 17:07.355
that is my plan B.

17:08.959 --> 17:11.559
Anyone want to hear plan A?

17:11.627 --> 17:13.127
I do.

17:13.195 --> 17:15.063
Me, too.

17:15.132 --> 17:16.364
Yes, boss.

17:22.539 --> 17:26.174
Sid, first thing in the
morning, you will report

17:26.242 --> 17:28.510
to the Office of the
Deputy Commissioner

17:28.578 --> 17:30.111
of Public Information.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.880
I'm gonna work for Garrett?

17:31.948 --> 17:34.916
No, you will be the acting DCPI.

17:34.985 --> 17:37.352
Baker, you will
take Sid's office.

17:37.421 --> 17:40.622
You will be the acting special
assistant to the commissioner.

17:40.691 --> 17:41.589
Seriously?

17:41.658 --> 17:42.869
- And Garrett...
- Frank,

17:42.893 --> 17:44.125
you made your point.

17:44.194 --> 17:45.860
I'm not answering phones.

17:46.963 --> 17:49.898
Oh, she does a lot
more than that.

17:51.468 --> 17:55.403
You will all report to your
new desks at 0600 hours.

17:55.472 --> 17:56.519
0600 hours?

17:56.520 --> 17:58.117
- 6:00 in the morning.
- It's military time.

17:58.141 --> 18:00.108
- I know what it means.
- At which time

18:00.177 --> 18:02.210
you will also have 24 hours

18:02.279 --> 18:05.914
to come to a consensus
about Abigail's program.

18:08.085 --> 18:09.651
That's a lot to ask.

18:11.755 --> 18:13.755
I ain't asking.

18:32.876 --> 18:34.576
You're still pissed.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.212
- You think?
- I told you

18:37.280 --> 18:38.446
that I was sorry

18:38.515 --> 18:40.093
and that I was just trying
to look out for you.

18:40.117 --> 18:42.817
And by doing so, you made me
look like a scared little girl

18:42.886 --> 18:44.452
who can't defend herself.

18:44.521 --> 18:46.788
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

18:46.857 --> 18:49.057
Two days ago,
Erin thought that I was a liar.

18:49.126 --> 18:51.393
And now she thinks
that I'm a liar and a wimp.

18:51.461 --> 18:53.194
Promise you,

18:53.263 --> 18:54.496
that was not my intention.

18:54.564 --> 18:56.531
Oh, I know that.
So, why do you think

18:56.600 --> 18:58.444
that you should go out there and
you should fight fights for me

18:58.468 --> 18:59.801
without ever asking me?

18:59.870 --> 19:01.903
Because we're getting
married, and I love you,

19:01.972 --> 19:03.571
and it's my job
to look after you.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.739
Not like that.

19:04.808 --> 19:06.040
Here's the thing.

19:06.109 --> 19:07.709
I want to marry you
more than anything,

19:07.778 --> 19:09.911
and by doing so,
I'm gonna become a Reagan.

19:09.980 --> 19:14.048
But I don't want
to <i>become</i> a Reagan.

19:14.117 --> 19:16.017
Does that make sense?

19:17.120 --> 19:18.453
No.

19:22.926 --> 19:24.526
Oh, my God. What...?

19:24.594 --> 19:25.860
- Remember this?
- What?

19:25.929 --> 19:27.862
No. What-what are
you doing here?

19:27.931 --> 19:29.230
You never saw this knife before?

19:29.299 --> 19:31.366
- No, I haven't.
- Your prints

19:31.435 --> 19:33.716
are all over the knife.
- How did you get my fingerprints?

19:33.770 --> 19:35.648
Your fingerprints are on file
here at the office.

19:35.672 --> 19:36.805
We got a subpoena.

19:38.108 --> 19:39.441
Care to explain?

19:39.509 --> 19:41.042
We were drinking.
I don't remember

19:41.111 --> 19:42.544
everything that I touched.

19:42.612 --> 19:44.679
Bad enough for you
to have to come with us.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.426
No, no, no. I talked
to my parents' lawyer.

19:46.450 --> 19:47.582
He said that I didn't have

19:47.651 --> 19:48.883
to say anything to you

19:48.952 --> 19:50.730
or go with you anywhere
unless I was under arrest.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.087
You <i>are</i> under arrest.

19:54.157 --> 19:55.068
No.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.259
Put your hands
behind your back, please.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.259
No!

19:57.260 --> 19:59.194
No, no, no, no, please.

19:59.262 --> 20:00.428
I swear. No, I swear.

20:00.497 --> 20:02.130
I didn't do anything.

20:02.199 --> 20:04.032
I didn't do anything
to hurt him.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.733
Please.

20:05.802 --> 20:08.036
- Okay.
- Please. I swear.

20:09.139 --> 20:10.605
Please.

20:10.674 --> 20:12.106
I loved him!

20:12.175 --> 20:14.175
Please, please, please, please.

20:49.775 --> 20:52.509
Anthony, what the hell
are you doing here?

20:52.578 --> 20:54.511
Same thing as you, I'm guessing.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.480
Staking out Leo Morris?

20:56.549 --> 20:57.314
Yeah.

20:57.383 --> 20:59.049
Oh.

20:59.118 --> 21:01.018
At least we're
in a nice, warm car

21:01.087 --> 21:02.753
with snacks.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.025
I just really want
to get this guy.

21:08.094 --> 21:09.360
I know. I don't blame you.

21:09.428 --> 21:12.897
I didn't fudge
my report, Anthony.

21:12.965 --> 21:14.899
He gave me that statement.

21:14.967 --> 21:16.233
I believe you.

21:16.302 --> 21:17.434
Erin doesn't.

21:17.503 --> 21:19.803
- That's not necessarily true.
- You heard her.

21:19.872 --> 21:21.772
When it comes to the job,
she's no-nonsense.

21:21.841 --> 21:23.941
Believe me, she would grill
her dead grandmother

21:24.010 --> 21:27.111
the same way she did you
if it would help the case.

21:27.179 --> 21:29.313
I didn't know that.

21:29.382 --> 21:31.248
Come on, they're
all like that.

21:31.317 --> 21:33.450
Who? Prosecutors?

21:33.519 --> 21:34.818
No, Reagans.

21:34.887 --> 21:36.220
And you should know that,

21:36.289 --> 21:38.255
because you're about
to become one of them.

21:38.324 --> 21:39.990
You make it sound
like they're...

21:40.059 --> 21:41.525
another species.

21:41.594 --> 21:43.360
Their entire life
is this job.

21:43.429 --> 21:45.932
And don't get me wrong, there's
no one better at it than them, but...

21:45.933 --> 21:48.232
it comes at a cost.

21:48.301 --> 21:49.900
Let me ask
you something.

21:49.969 --> 21:52.403
Anybody at that family dinner
you go to every week

21:52.471 --> 21:55.139
setting the world on fire
in their personal life?

21:55.207 --> 21:57.775
And I'm not saying
anything bad.

21:57.843 --> 22:00.411
I'm not trying
to talk you out of anything.

22:00.479 --> 22:04.348
I'm just saying,
open your eyes a little.

22:04.417 --> 22:07.117
Know what you're
getting yourself into.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.623
Can I quote you on that?

22:12.692 --> 22:14.992
Um... quote me?

22:16.162 --> 22:18.796
Can you excuse me for one sec?

22:21.634 --> 22:23.100
Thank you.

22:27.540 --> 22:28.906
Hello? I mean, uh,

22:28.975 --> 22:30.886
Commissioner Reagan's office.
How may I help you?

22:30.910 --> 22:32.509
Yeah, I need your help.

22:32.578 --> 22:34.445
Oh, it's you.
I got this reporter here,

22:34.513 --> 22:36.480
- Brett something or other, from...
- Brent.

22:36.549 --> 22:40.484
Alston. With <i>The New York Times.</i>

22:40.553 --> 22:41.485
Yeah, that guy.

22:41.554 --> 22:42.953
He wants to quote me.

22:43.022 --> 22:44.588
Absolutely not.

22:44.657 --> 22:46.590
That's what <i>I</i> thought.
Listen, any chance

22:46.659 --> 22:48.459
you could come here
and talk to this guy?

22:48.527 --> 22:50.160
- He's really intense.
- What was it

22:50.229 --> 22:52.496
you said to me
in the parking lot last night?

22:52.565 --> 22:53.831
"I spent my whole life

22:53.899 --> 22:55.459
"chasing bad guys--
you think I'm scared

22:55.501 --> 22:57.801
of some nerd reporter?"

23:00.840 --> 23:03.841
Seriously? What am
I supposed to do with all these?

23:03.909 --> 23:05.687
Those are your CompStat files.
You got to go through them

23:05.711 --> 23:06.944
and build a case.
Build a case.

23:07.013 --> 23:08.779
How exactly do I do that?

23:08.848 --> 23:10.481
You got to go
through all the files,

23:10.549 --> 23:12.127
scrutinize every
investigative step, right,

23:12.151 --> 23:14.685
and see what they missed.
- How will I know?

23:14.754 --> 23:16.798
Gee, Abigail, I don't know,
I'm just a ginormous head

23:16.822 --> 23:17.899
with half a brain, remember?

23:17.923 --> 23:19.790
Sid, come on.
I didn't mean that.

23:23.095 --> 23:24.361
Hello?

23:24.430 --> 23:25.529
Hey. It's me.

23:25.598 --> 23:27.664
Look, he-he's asking
for his schedule,

23:27.733 --> 23:29.366
and I think
I-I've accidentally deleted

23:29.435 --> 23:30.634
some of his events.

23:30.703 --> 23:32.736
Just go into
the "recently deleted" folder

23:32.805 --> 23:33.904
and retrieve them.

23:33.973 --> 23:36.073
But I'm locked out.

23:36.142 --> 23:38.575
I printed out
a piece of paper for you to use

23:38.644 --> 23:40.144
that had everything
you would need,

23:40.212 --> 23:42.846
including a super user password.
Do you have it?

23:42.915 --> 23:45.382
Can you just come here
and do it?

23:45.451 --> 23:47.017
Oh, but then I'd
be robbing you

23:47.086 --> 23:49.019
of the opportunity to
fully appreciate the fact

23:49.088 --> 23:50.888
that my job is
quite a bit more

23:50.956 --> 23:54.324
than answering phones, making
coffee and hanging Frank's coat.

23:54.393 --> 23:55.492
So that's a no?

23:55.561 --> 23:57.694
Yeah, a big fat one.

24:02.468 --> 24:05.069
Finally, a case served
on a silver platter.

24:05.137 --> 24:06.537
You're welcome.

24:06.605 --> 24:08.772
And this fingerprint thing,
that was your idea?

24:09.909 --> 24:12.142
Really great work, Detective.

24:17.016 --> 24:18.016
What?

24:18.084 --> 24:19.161
- Nothing.
- What is it with him?

24:19.185 --> 24:20.451
Shouldn't you be doing

24:20.519 --> 24:21.630
a Snoopy dance or something?

24:21.654 --> 24:23.720
Whoo-hoo.
He's having doubts.

24:23.789 --> 24:26.190
Doubts? You got this cold.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.959
When we went to collar her,
she fell to her knees

24:29.028 --> 24:31.295
and swore up and down
that she was innocent.

24:31.363 --> 24:32.796
Doesn't every perp do that?

24:32.865 --> 24:34.765
That's exactly
what I said.

24:34.834 --> 24:36.633
So what's the difference
with this one?

24:36.702 --> 24:39.636
What's different
with this one is that...

24:39.705 --> 24:42.206
I believed her.

24:59.558 --> 25:03.227
Leo. You forgot your pizza.

25:03.295 --> 25:05.629
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

25:05.698 --> 25:07.164
What is that?

25:07.233 --> 25:08.599
That is
your bank statement, Leo.

25:08.667 --> 25:09.766
I can explain.

25:09.835 --> 25:12.436
Yeah. I think you better.

25:33.526 --> 25:35.359
Mr. Moore, what's going on?

25:35.427 --> 25:38.195
Contemplating all the
bad decisions in life

25:38.264 --> 25:40.130
that led me to here.

25:41.567 --> 25:42.799
He's expecting you.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.706
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:49.775 --> 25:51.775
What'd I just see?

25:51.844 --> 25:53.844
Too soon to tell.

25:53.913 --> 25:56.079
Okay. I've been working
on my speech.

25:56.148 --> 25:58.515
Want to hear what I got so far?

25:58.584 --> 25:59.584
Sure.

26:00.853 --> 26:02.419
Okay.

26:02.488 --> 26:05.022
"For those of you
who don't know me,

26:05.090 --> 26:07.991
I'm the father of the groom."

26:08.060 --> 26:09.860
It's a small rehearsal
dinner, Dad.

26:09.929 --> 26:11.862
Everyone's gonna
know who you are.

26:11.931 --> 26:13.630
That's the funny part.

26:15.801 --> 26:17.801
You always start with a joke.

26:17.870 --> 26:19.736
Ah.

26:19.805 --> 26:21.538
You missed the funny part.

26:25.044 --> 26:26.276
Okay.

26:29.415 --> 26:30.747
Talk to me.

26:31.951 --> 26:33.283
Easing right into it, huh?

26:33.352 --> 26:35.686
Well, you hardly ever ask
to come up here,

26:35.754 --> 26:39.156
and I hardly ever make an exception
and let you come up, so...

26:41.126 --> 26:44.261
I guess it's what they
call "the jitters."

26:44.330 --> 26:47.231
But not you.

26:47.299 --> 26:48.932
Eddie.

26:49.001 --> 26:51.335
Why do you say that?

26:51.403 --> 26:55.072
Because I have never seen you
so unwaveringly certain

26:55.140 --> 26:56.506
of what you want,

26:56.575 --> 26:59.476
aside from late '60s
Detroit muscle.

27:02.181 --> 27:04.381
She seems a little spooked.

27:04.450 --> 27:06.450
What's she saying?

27:06.518 --> 27:08.352
A little all over
the place, but...

27:08.420 --> 27:10.153
she said one
thing that stuck.

27:10.222 --> 27:12.122
She doesn't want
to lose herself.

27:12.191 --> 27:14.424
That makes sense.

27:14.493 --> 27:15.792
It does?

27:15.861 --> 27:17.995
Yeah. Let me ask you,
how many times

27:18.063 --> 27:20.230
have you been over
to <i>her</i> family's house

27:20.299 --> 27:21.698
for Sunday dinner?

27:21.767 --> 27:23.634
Well, her brother's dead,
her dad's in jail,

27:23.702 --> 27:25.369
and her mom's not
really the type.

27:28.707 --> 27:32.009
Did you listen
to what you just said?

27:35.848 --> 27:38.081
She feels like she's
joining our family

27:38.150 --> 27:40.717
a lot more than
I'm joining hers.

27:40.786 --> 27:44.621
And not just any family,
it's us.

27:44.690 --> 27:47.090
Part ancient tribe,
part wolf pack.

27:47.159 --> 27:49.393
- Yeah.
- And she doesn't even have

27:49.461 --> 27:53.263
one of her own to walk her
down the aisle to seal the deal.

27:54.933 --> 27:57.868
Jamie...

27:57.936 --> 27:59.803
Jamie, don't...

27:59.872 --> 28:03.307
let her do all the work
adjusting to <i>us.</i>

28:04.910 --> 28:08.145
Find opportunities to lead us...

28:08.213 --> 28:10.614
into adjusting to her.

28:23.228 --> 28:25.562
We know that Patrick and Rachel
began their night together

28:25.631 --> 28:26.963
at the Moomba Room, right?

28:27.032 --> 28:29.433
But we never paid enough
attention to the fact

28:29.501 --> 28:32.002
that they didn't arrive at
the Moomba Room together.

28:32.071 --> 28:33.637
- They met there.
- That's right.

28:33.706 --> 28:35.466
Based on Patrick's reaction
to seeing Rachel,

28:35.507 --> 28:36.795
he didn't even know
she was coming.

28:36.796 --> 28:38.022
He was completely surprised.

28:38.046 --> 28:40.511
Okay, so they still
went home together,

28:40.512 --> 28:42.312
and he still wound up dead.

28:42.381 --> 28:44.147
So it got me to thinking.

28:44.216 --> 28:46.516
If he didn't know he was
gonna meet up with Rachel,

28:46.585 --> 28:48.952
what did he have planned
for earlier in the night?

28:49.021 --> 28:50.954
Okay, so what'd you find?

28:51.023 --> 28:52.422
Patrick...

28:52.491 --> 28:55.258
had a date with somebody else
two hours earlier.

29:19.469 --> 29:20.802
We're out of time.

29:20.871 --> 29:21.688
We did what he asked.

29:21.689 --> 29:24.188
She walked us through.
We chimed in with some notes.

29:24.257 --> 29:25.690
We were helpful, right?

29:25.758 --> 29:27.925
More than helpful.

29:27.994 --> 29:29.427
And you'll mention
that, right?

29:29.495 --> 29:30.595
Of course I will.

29:30.663 --> 29:32.330
Okay. There we go.

29:32.398 --> 29:33.798
I lied...

29:33.867 --> 29:36.033
when I said
the reason I didn't...

29:36.102 --> 29:37.802
share my idea with you first

29:37.871 --> 29:41.105
was because I didn't think
it was a big deal.

29:41.174 --> 29:42.540
I believed

29:42.609 --> 29:44.008
in this idea...

29:44.077 --> 29:46.174
and I wanted him
to know it was mine.

29:46.198 --> 29:47.112
I knew it.

29:47.113 --> 29:48.224
- See, Garrett?
- Yeah, I see.

29:48.248 --> 29:49.647
Can you blame her?

29:51.417 --> 29:54.552
Our behavior this week,
Abigail, it's embarrassing.

29:54.621 --> 29:58.322
Well, it takes two to tango,
and I was right there with you.

29:58.391 --> 30:00.925
And if I can be
totally honest...

30:00.994 --> 30:02.560
I felt threatened.

30:02.629 --> 30:03.961
I know how
smart you are.

30:04.030 --> 30:05.529
I know...

30:05.598 --> 30:07.131
how well you can do my job.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.901
Oh, please. I wouldn't
get out of the driveway.

30:09.969 --> 30:11.969
If we're all being all honest...

30:13.373 --> 30:16.173
I know I've just
been barely keeping my head

30:16.242 --> 30:17.775
above water around here.

30:20.046 --> 30:22.380
It's been like that
since day one.

30:27.153 --> 30:28.085
No, Sid.

30:28.154 --> 30:29.887
You...

30:29.956 --> 30:32.857
are the beating heart
of this place.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.093
Come here.

30:37.263 --> 30:38.829
Come on, get in here.

31:03.049 --> 31:04.455
Well?

31:04.928 --> 31:06.994
We have your revisions.

31:08.098 --> 31:09.764
Good.

31:11.134 --> 31:13.568
Though that was never my point.

31:29.939 --> 31:31.839
If it was against the law
to have a bad date,

31:31.908 --> 31:34.075
this entire city
would be behind bars.

31:35.511 --> 31:36.644
What's this?

31:36.713 --> 31:38.170
You're client's
cell phone pinged

31:38.171 --> 31:40.471
off the tower nearest
to Patrick's apartment building

31:40.540 --> 31:42.156
four hours after their date,

31:42.157 --> 31:43.490
because she waited outside.

31:43.558 --> 31:45.690
You've got surveillance
from the building's cameras?

31:45.691 --> 31:47.101
Does my client appear
in that footage?

31:47.125 --> 31:48.491
No, she doesn't.

31:48.527 --> 31:49.859
Didn't think so.

31:49.928 --> 31:51.406
- Because she wasn't there.
- But she does

31:51.430 --> 31:52.941
make an appearance
in the footage we pulled

31:52.965 --> 31:55.365
of the neighboring building's
alley.

31:55.434 --> 31:57.233
A very bloody appearance.

32:26.999 --> 32:28.264
You wanted to see me?

32:28.333 --> 32:29.599
Eddie, come on in.

32:33.872 --> 32:37.440
A $10,000 deposit into
Leo Morris's bank account.

32:37.509 --> 32:38.808
Nice work.

32:38.877 --> 32:40.810
Did you get him to
admit to the bribe?

32:40.879 --> 32:42.812
Well, for a guy who makes

32:42.881 --> 32:44.581
40 grand a year,
it was hard to explain.

32:44.649 --> 32:46.149
The defendant's brother

32:46.218 --> 32:49.119
and a fellow gang member
paid him for his silence.

32:49.187 --> 32:51.021
Well, what happens now?

32:51.089 --> 32:52.300
All three of them
are gonna be charged

32:52.324 --> 32:53.757
with bribery
and witness tampering.

32:53.825 --> 32:56.659
So, again, nice work.

32:56.728 --> 33:00.764
Well, I'm glad I was able
to see this one through.

33:00.832 --> 33:04.100
Same.

33:04.169 --> 33:06.803
Look, turns out
I owe you an apology.

33:06.872 --> 33:09.105
I thought you might say that,
but it's not true.

33:09.174 --> 33:11.041
No, I do.
I accused you of lying.

33:11.109 --> 33:12.976
Not exactly.

33:13.045 --> 33:14.644
You questioned me.

33:14.713 --> 33:15.979
I got insulted.

33:16.048 --> 33:17.647
I overreacted.

33:17.716 --> 33:20.216
And then I whined to Jamie
about it.

33:20.285 --> 33:22.886
Well, I think maybe you're being
a little hard on yourself.

33:22.954 --> 33:24.954
No, that's not even
the worst part.

33:25.023 --> 33:27.357
The worst part...

33:27.426 --> 33:31.061
is that I got mad at him
when he came to you.

33:31.129 --> 33:34.597
But, let's me honest,
part of me wanted him to.

33:34.666 --> 33:36.833
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have complained to him.

33:36.902 --> 33:38.835
Well, when you put it
that way...

33:38.904 --> 33:40.703
I don't want anyone else
fighting my battles.

33:40.772 --> 33:43.907
- I don't think you do.
- So I'm making a choice here.

33:43.975 --> 33:48.545
I've decided that you weren't
picking on me,

33:48.613 --> 33:50.680
you were treating me
as an equal.

33:52.584 --> 33:55.852
And coming from you, that's...

33:55.921 --> 33:58.521
a really big honor.

34:02.627 --> 34:05.862
Well, Eddie Janko,

34:05.931 --> 34:08.498
soon to be Reagan,

34:08.567 --> 34:11.301
you continue to surprise,
don't you?

34:13.304 --> 34:15.804
I'm just getting started.

34:26.251 --> 34:28.418
I must say
what I'm most

34:28.487 --> 34:30.018
struck by this evening

34:30.088 --> 34:31.588
is how well mannered,

34:31.656 --> 34:33.556
charming, welcoming,

34:33.625 --> 34:35.692
and strikingly handsome
you all are.

34:37.629 --> 34:38.895
The handsome part's all me.

34:41.099 --> 34:43.233
Hey, what are we, chopped liver?

34:43.301 --> 34:44.967
But what I most admire

34:45.036 --> 34:49.038
is your sincerity
and brutal honesty.

34:49.107 --> 34:50.974
You have no idea
how brutal.

34:51.042 --> 34:52.542
I assure you

34:52.610 --> 34:54.878
Edit and myself,

34:54.946 --> 34:58.047
who have both suffered from my
husband's glaring deficiency

34:58.116 --> 35:01.417
in that department...

35:01.486 --> 35:04.287
it is greatly appreciated.

35:04.356 --> 35:05.722
So to you, Jameson.

35:05.790 --> 35:08.791
Thank you for loving my daughter

35:08.860 --> 35:11.094
as much as I do.

35:11.163 --> 35:13.630
And I raise a toast

35:13.698 --> 35:16.566
to all of your
sublime qualities...

35:17.736 --> 35:18.835
...not the least of which

35:18.904 --> 35:21.471
is your wonderful family.

35:21.540 --> 35:22.805
- Cheers.
- Thank you, Lena.

35:22.874 --> 35:24.674
- Hear, hear.
- I'll drink to that.

35:24.743 --> 35:25.942
Cheers.

35:26.011 --> 35:27.011
Cheers.

35:27.045 --> 35:28.344
To Jamko.

35:28.413 --> 35:29.362
Jamko?

35:29.386 --> 35:30.548
What's Jamko?

35:30.549 --> 35:32.515
- Jamie and Janko.
- Yeah, Jamko.

35:34.085 --> 35:35.463
It's all right, I wasn't
following it, either.

35:35.487 --> 35:37.120
Why do you call
Eddie "Eh-deet"?

35:37.189 --> 35:38.922
It's Hungarian for Edith.

35:38.990 --> 35:40.390
Would you learn something,
numbnuts?

35:41.993 --> 35:43.986
She just made a comment
about our manners.

35:44.010 --> 35:45.212
Well, I'm just...
I'm breaking her in.

35:45.213 --> 35:47.263
Sorry, I'm breaking her in.

35:47.332 --> 35:48.531
Okay? All right?

35:48.600 --> 35:52.001
Ah, okay.

35:52.070 --> 35:53.303
Tomorrow morning,

35:53.338 --> 35:57.473
Edit is heading full tilt

35:57.542 --> 35:59.342
into the bravest act

35:59.411 --> 36:03.179
any cop I've ever known
has attempted.

36:03.248 --> 36:06.349
And I ain't just talking about
marrying Jamie.

36:06.418 --> 36:08.351
Ooh.

36:08.420 --> 36:09.819
Although,

36:09.888 --> 36:13.990
that would be plenty, for sure.

36:14.059 --> 36:17.894
You see... before the I-do's,

36:17.963 --> 36:22.332
she is walking down the aisle
by herself.

36:22.400 --> 36:26.703
She is bucking a nod to...

36:26.771 --> 36:30.540
an antiquated tradition,
a tradition

36:30.609 --> 36:32.775
of the father of the bride

36:32.844 --> 36:36.012
giving away his daughter.

36:37.415 --> 36:40.283
But, you see...

36:40.352 --> 36:45.455
Eddie isn't anyone's
to give away.

36:47.726 --> 36:50.360
She is her own woman.

36:50.428 --> 36:53.863
And her own life force.

36:53.932 --> 36:56.699
And I have seen it in action
on the job,

36:56.768 --> 36:59.535
and we have all seen it

36:59.604 --> 37:01.771
in action at our dinner table.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.006
Oh, yeah.

37:05.644 --> 37:09.545
And I so look forward
to seeing her in action

37:09.614 --> 37:12.248
as Jamie's life partner.

37:16.688 --> 37:20.957
And, hopefully, as a mother.

37:21.026 --> 37:24.927
And as a hurricane
of fresh air

37:24.996 --> 37:27.363
and candor and strength

37:27.432 --> 37:30.166
for our family.

37:32.037 --> 37:35.038
So... Lena...

37:38.476 --> 37:40.443
Edit...

37:41.946 --> 37:46.382
We are so very glad,

37:46.451 --> 37:50.553
and truly privileged
to have you join us.

38:04.969 --> 38:06.169
Where's Dad?

38:06.237 --> 38:07.837
Don't know. Gramps?

38:07.906 --> 38:09.505
Said he had to take a call.

38:09.574 --> 38:11.908
Well, he is
the police commissioner.

38:13.578 --> 38:14.744
Ah.

38:14.813 --> 38:15.956
You're sure you want
to go through with this?

38:15.980 --> 38:17.847
Yes.

38:17.916 --> 38:19.749
Truly sure?

38:19.818 --> 38:21.784
Uh, yes.

38:21.853 --> 38:24.654
Why are you asking me
about this right now?

38:24.723 --> 38:26.756
Because in over 2,000 weddings,

38:26.825 --> 38:28.925
I've only lost three to divorce

38:28.993 --> 38:30.993
and I don't want any more dents
in my record.

38:32.564 --> 38:35.164
Couldn't be more sure.

38:35.233 --> 38:36.499
Good.

38:36.568 --> 38:38.968
Then let's go.

39:24.516 --> 39:25.748
Danny, where is he?

39:25.817 --> 39:28.651
I don't know.
You know where he is?

39:37.962 --> 39:42.398
I really-- I really loved what
you said last night, but...

39:45.103 --> 39:47.203
Y-You really sure about this?

39:50.308 --> 39:53.409
Every night for the last month,

39:53.478 --> 39:57.013
I've been having the same
nightmare that I'm...

39:58.750 --> 40:03.152
I'm gonna trip over
the hem of my gown

40:03.221 --> 40:06.355
and face-plant
in front of everybody.

40:10.028 --> 40:13.229
I'll always have
your six o'clock.
