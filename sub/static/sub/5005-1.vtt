01:06.880 --> 01:10.839
<i>Happy birthday, dear Janice</i>

01:10.920 --> 01:14.356
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

01:16.400 --> 01:19.278
<i>It's my anorexic boss' birthday.</i>

01:20.520 --> 01:22.829
<i>This means there's a certain amount of</i>
<i>inter-office pressure</i>

01:22.920 --> 01:24.911
<i>to stand around the conference table</i>

01:25.000 --> 01:28.231
<i>eating crappy food</i>
<i>and pretending to worship her.</i>

01:29.920 --> 01:31.148
That's so good.

01:31.240 --> 01:35.392
<i>Acting for five minutes like Janice</i>
<i>doesn't make all our lives miserable</i>

01:35.480 --> 01:38.074
<i>is the hardest work I'll do all day.</i>

01:44.120 --> 01:46.350
<i>My job title is account manager.</i>

01:46.960 --> 01:50.350
<i>I used to be called</i>
<i>an account service representative,</i>

01:50.440 --> 01:53.716
<i>but a consultant told us we needed</i>
<i>to manage our clients</i>

01:53.800 --> 01:55.597
<i>and not service them.</i>

02:01.120 --> 02:04.271
<i>I have a girlfriend whom</i>
<i>I neither manage nor service.</i>

02:04.360 --> 02:07.830
<i>That's my best friend, Barry,</i>
<i>fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table</i>

02:07.920 --> 02:10.434
<i>I picked up for a really good price.</i>

02:12.280 --> 02:15.670
<i>I'm finding it hard to care about</i>
<i>anything these days.</i>

02:15.760 --> 02:20.788
<i>In fact, the only thing I do care about</i>
<i>is the fact that I can't care about anything.</i>

02:20.880 --> 02:22.518
<i>Seriously. It worries me.</i>

02:24.160 --> 02:26.390
<i>My name is Wesley Gibson.</i>

02:30.480 --> 02:33.711
<i>My dad walked out on my mom</i>
<i>when I was seven days old.</i>

02:33.800 --> 02:38.351
<i>Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked</i>
<i>into my baby blues eyes and asked himself,</i>

02:39.320 --> 02:43.950
<i>"Did I just father the most insignificant</i>
<i>asshole of the 21st century?"</i>

02:58.840 --> 03:02.992
Well, if you could get me the consignment
to me by the 28th... Yeah.

03:03.680 --> 03:06.399
Do you have the numbers in front of you?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.149
Relax.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.232
If your name had come up,
you'd be dead already.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.678
We've had some unexpected losses recently.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.037
We'd like to know

03:30.120 --> 03:32.918
where our competitor
is getting his munition.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.959
It's clean.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.554
Meaning?

03:46.040 --> 03:47.996
Meaning it's untraceable.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.635
Your competitor's very smart.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.074
Get down!

04:08.960 --> 04:10.188
Fuck it.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.708
No one leaves the Fraternity, Cross.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.112
<i>I have a new perspective on the Fraternity.</i>

05:39.200 --> 05:40.599
Careful.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.434
You don't destroy something that's been
around for a thousand years.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.353
<i>It's already destroyed.</i>
<i>He broke the code.</i>

05:47.600 --> 05:49.511
<i>I have to stop this.</i>

05:49.600 --> 05:51.477
- Really?
<i>- You know this.</i>

05:52.560 --> 05:54.949
So why don't you face me yourself?

05:57.680 --> 05:59.955
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.476
<i>They were just the decoys.</i>

06:04.120 --> 06:05.712
<i>Goodbye, Mr X.</i>

06:38.080 --> 06:40.355
<i>Never send sheep to kill a wolf.</i>

06:40.440 --> 06:42.510
They were just the decoys.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.068
Wesley!

06:46.160 --> 06:47.195
What is it?

06:47.280 --> 06:49.077
What do you mean, "What is it"? Listen.

06:51.480 --> 06:55.189
Well, how am I suppose to sleep
with all that fucking racket?

06:55.800 --> 06:59.509
When are we gonna move so we don't
have to wake up to that shit?

06:59.600 --> 07:01.238
I kind of like it.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.994
<i>It helps to drown out the sound</i>
<i>of your annoying, fucking voice.</i>

07:06.080 --> 07:08.116
<i>Now, please, let me sleep.</i>

07:08.200 --> 07:10.509
Have you even thought about our talk?

07:10.600 --> 07:11.635
Yes.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.273
Which one?

07:15.720 --> 07:17.676
Perfect. That's perfect.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.992
Feed Annabelle.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.589
Sorry.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.711
Oh, my fucking God.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.431
I hope that's not my billing report
sitting on your desk.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.875
Holy shit on an altar, it is.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.513
I want that report on my desk in one hour.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.990
Okay, everybody,
we're all gonna stay an extra hour...

08:23.080 --> 08:24.991
<i>Want to hear something sad?</i>

08:25.080 --> 08:29.551
<i>I need an ergonomic keyboard</i>
<i>to keep my repetitive stress injury in check.</i>

08:29.640 --> 08:33.996
<i>Just the fact that I repeat something enough</i>
<i>that it causes me stress is fucking sad.</i>

08:34.080 --> 08:36.275
Nice job, dude. You seen Barry?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.994
He had to go to the dentist. Again.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.828
Yes!

08:44.159 --> 08:45.229
Barry!

08:49.080 --> 08:51.469
You think they have that
morning-after pill here?

08:51.560 --> 08:53.073
That thing works.
Crush it up, put it in her omelette,

08:53.160 --> 08:56.869
"Hey, baby, breakfast in bed."
You can never be too safe.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.359
Oh, God.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.510
I lost my wallet somewhere.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.192
All this together?

09:06.160 --> 09:07.832
- No, no.
- Yes.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.233
He is the man.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.550
- How much is it?
- Oh. Plus this.

09:14.640 --> 09:15.834
$20.42.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.273
Watermelon.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.119
Chicks dig it.

09:24.000 --> 09:24.989
Thanks.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.475
See you next time.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.595
Have a good night.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.159
I love these energy drinks, man.

09:29.240 --> 09:32.073
I'm almost, like, kind of on
an energy drink cleanse,

09:32.160 --> 09:35.152
where I do one for breakfast
and then, like, two or three for lunch.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.468
<i>I'm the man?</i>

09:36.560 --> 09:38.710
<i> Yeah, right, Barry, I'm the man.</i>

09:38.800 --> 09:40.153
<i>In fact, I'm so much the man,</i>

09:40.240 --> 09:44.756
<i>I have a standing prescription for</i>
<i>medication to control my anxiety attacks.</i>

09:45.240 --> 09:47.800
<i>God, I wish I had something else</i>
<i>to relieve my stress.</i>

09:47.880 --> 09:49.393
Hello, Wesley.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.952
<i>You know, there are people,</i>
<i>beautiful people,</i>

09:55.040 --> 09:58.635
<i>you just wish they could see you</i>
<i>in a different setting, a different place,</i>

09:58.720 --> 10:01.075
<i>instead of where you are,</i>
<i>what you've become.</i>

10:01.160 --> 10:02.798
Nicole is so hot.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.428
What?

10:06.280 --> 10:08.271
Boom goes the dynamite.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.113
<i>But most of all,</i>
<i>you wish you weren't such a pussy</i>

10:11.200 --> 10:14.192
<i>for wishing for things</i>
<i>that will never change.</i>

10:16.760 --> 10:19.638
Good God A'mighty, you're over
here like it's spring fucking break,

10:19.720 --> 10:21.915
and I still don't have that billing report.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.468
Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?

10:25.160 --> 10:26.798
I'll get it done, Janice.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.236
Like I never heard that before.
"I'll get it done."

10:31.400 --> 10:33.436
"I'll get it done. I'll get it done, Janice.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.192
"I'll get it done."

10:46.080 --> 10:49.231
Why don't you have anything
to say for yourself?

10:49.680 --> 10:52.114
I'm sorry.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.199
Well, you're worthless.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.158
I'm the one who's sorry I hired your ass.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.910
<i>You know what the best thing is</i>
<i>about the end of the day?</i>

11:25.000 --> 11:27.833
<i>Tomorrow it starts all over again.</i>

12:36.760 --> 12:38.671
- Hi. How you doing?
- Good.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.628
- I'm sorry?
- You apologise too much.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.118
Sorry about that.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.917
I knew your father.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.113
My father left the week I was born, so...

13:16.120 --> 13:20.193
Your father died yesterday on the rooftop
of the Metropolitan Building.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.554
Sorry.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.238
Look, the liquor rounds
are just over there, so...

13:29.320 --> 13:31.834
Your father was one of the greatest
assassins who ever lived.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.434
The man who killed him is behind you.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.311
This guy's just shooting up...

14:58.880 --> 15:00.313
Sorry. Sorry.

15:25.160 --> 15:28.948
What... Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What the fuck just happened?

15:32.520 --> 15:34.715
Please! Please! Please drive faster.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.597
- Please be quiet.
- Please drive... Please drive faster.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.990
Please... Please understand
that I care about my life!

15:44.960 --> 15:47.076
I don't know what the fuck
you did to piss this guy off,

15:47.160 --> 15:49.116
but you're gonna have to let me out
and call the cops!

15:51.880 --> 15:53.108
Hey! Hey!

15:56.720 --> 16:00.315
What are you doing? Oh, shit!
Are you crazy?

16:04.120 --> 16:05.394
Oh, shit!

16:10.520 --> 16:12.476
I think we lost him. I think we lost him.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.597
Could you let me out
at the next corner, please?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.188
Shit!

16:21.040 --> 16:22.029
Fuck!

16:24.400 --> 16:26.038
Oh, shit!

16:28.160 --> 16:29.752
He's right there!

16:40.640 --> 16:43.677
Look, I'm an accountant.
I'm just an accountant.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.632
Oh, fuck!

16:49.280 --> 16:51.635
He's fucking persistent, you know.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.115
Fuck!

17:01.280 --> 17:03.032
You kick his ass!

17:07.680 --> 17:08.954
Shoot him!

17:10.119 --> 17:13.907
What are you doing?
What are you shooting our car for, huh?

17:15.560 --> 17:18.233
- Are you crazy?
- Grab the wheel.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.632
Where are you going?

17:22.240 --> 17:23.832
Get back in here!

17:25.240 --> 17:27.800
Oh, my God!

17:42.840 --> 17:44.796
Oh, damn! I'm sorry.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.399
- Gun!
- What?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.558
Under the seat!

17:59.640 --> 18:00.709
Here.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.514
Oh, shit!

18:30.080 --> 18:31.832
Shit!

18:37.760 --> 18:38.749
- Look out!
- Get out!

18:38.840 --> 18:40.990
Look out! Oh, my God!

18:41.080 --> 18:42.274
Shit!

18:49.880 --> 18:54.590
I'm sorry!

19:12.480 --> 19:13.959
Behind you!

20:38.240 --> 20:39.434
Fuck.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.199
Shit. Shit.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.349
Hello.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.510
I don't have any money or...

20:51.680 --> 20:53.432
I thought he'd be

20:53.720 --> 20:55.073
taller.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.428
Taller?

20:58.720 --> 20:59.914
Sir...

21:00.800 --> 21:05.112
Sir, I've been trying to explain
to the lady here that I'm an accountant.

21:05.200 --> 21:08.749
I'm an account service representative...
I'm an account manager.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.673
And I'm sure that if you call
my boss, Janice,

21:11.760 --> 21:14.513
she'd fill you in on whatever
has gone wrong.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.717
You can contact her by email or...
She'll put you straight.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.950
Shoot the wings off the flies.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.030
I don't know what that means.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.837
Shoot the wings off the flies.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.750
I really think you have me mixed up
with somebody else.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.553
On three.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.235
Either you shoot, or I do.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.235
One.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.355
Okay.

22:02.680 --> 22:03.749
Two.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.796
I can't even see them!

22:11.120 --> 22:12.314
Three.

22:29.080 --> 22:30.593
Okay. Okay.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.829
That's impossible.

22:51.920 --> 22:55.230
A lot of things for you
weren't possible before today.

22:55.960 --> 22:59.077
What you experienced, Wesley,
was not a panic attack.

22:59.720 --> 23:03.349
Your heart was beating in excess of
400 beats per minute,

23:03.440 --> 23:06.034
sending abundant amounts of
adrenaline into your bloodstream.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.157
This allows you to see and react faster
than normal.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.038
Only a few people in the world can do that.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.312
Your father could do it and you can do it.

23:16.240 --> 23:19.630
With a little work,
you can learn to control these attacks.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.438
Stay away from me.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.513
Just stay back from me.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.795
I have a gun, sir. All right?

23:27.680 --> 23:29.272
My name is Sloan.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.519
This is Fox.

23:31.920 --> 23:35.117
And the others you see around you
are all very good at killing.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.430
So, if I were you,
I'd keep the gun pointed at me.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.476
You don't wanna point it at any of them.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.073
That's better.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.513
- You're insane.
- No.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.591
Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing

23:44.680 --> 23:46.955
when you have the blood of a killer
flowing in your veins.

23:47.040 --> 23:50.396
Insanity is being shit on, beat down,

23:50.840 --> 23:52.831
coasting through life
in a miserable existence

23:52.920 --> 23:56.833
when you have a caged lion locked inside
and a key to release it.

23:57.960 --> 24:02.158
This gun you're holding is an Imanishi 17.
It belonged to your father.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.993
He could conduct
a symphony orchestra with it.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.914
And you're going to use it to kill the man
who shot him down in cold blood.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.595
- I can't...
- The same man who tried to kill you tonight.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.355
Your father was one of us.

24:18.440 --> 24:22.069
A fraternity of assassins.
The weapons of fate.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.398
We've transferred all of his assets
over to you.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.756
And let me assure you, they are substantial.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.196
It is your long-awaited destiny

24:35.280 --> 24:36.679
to join us.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.830
Back off. Back off.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.875
You don't know anything about me.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.919
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.036
You stay away from me?

25:00.120 --> 25:03.237
You stay away from me, please?
Will you let me through?

25:33.440 --> 25:36.750
<i>You know when you have a dream</i>
<i>and you're half awake,</i>

25:36.840 --> 25:38.796
<i>but it's still in the fringe of your brain?</i>

25:38.880 --> 25:42.509
<i>Then you open your eyes</i>
<i>and you're so damn glad it was a dream.</i>

25:49.880 --> 25:51.916
<i>This was nothing like that.</i>

26:17.320 --> 26:20.232
I'm sorry. Could you just give me
one second? Thank you.

26:29.520 --> 26:30.748
Oh, shit.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.954
Wesley.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.672
What's up with you?

26:48.200 --> 26:49.872
What do you mean?

26:50.560 --> 26:53.120
You're... You're here early.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.672
Is... You seem a little pepped up.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.149
- You all right?
- Well, yeah.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.155
Yeah.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.672
I guess I feel

27:05.640 --> 27:07.517
kind of different.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.560
Whatever. I'm gonna go get
some Post-it Notes. Do you want one?

27:10.640 --> 27:11.675
- No.
- Really?

27:11.760 --> 27:13.432
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.555
Jesus H. fucking Popsicle,
I still don't have my billing reports,

27:30.640 --> 27:33.438
but you've got time to sit here
and Google your ass off.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.999
Well, I know one thing.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.435
You've got your review
coming up next week,

27:37.520 --> 27:41.672
and I can't wait to start checking me off
some big fucking boxes.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.638
Attitude, poor! Performance, poor!

27:45.880 --> 27:47.836
Management skills, poor!

27:47.920 --> 27:51.071
Works well with others.
That's a fucking joke.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.674
What is this bullshit? Who's this prick?

27:54.760 --> 27:57.593
Some loser gets his head blown off
at the Metropolitan...

27:57.680 --> 27:59.796
Shut the fuck up!

28:07.440 --> 28:10.796
She has one single iota of tenuous power.

28:10.880 --> 28:13.599
She thinks she can push everyone around.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.712
You don't need this.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.233
I understand.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.873
Junior high must have been kind of tough,

28:26.960 --> 28:30.430
but it doesn't give you the right to treat
your workers like horseshit, Janice.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.795
I know we laugh at you, Janice.

28:33.280 --> 28:36.636
We all know you keep your stash of jelly
doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.711
But I want you to know

28:39.200 --> 28:43.159
if you weren't such a bitch,
we'd feel sorry for you.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.351
I do feel sorry for you.

28:48.280 --> 28:51.033
But as it stands, the way you behave,

28:51.840 --> 28:54.673
I feel I can speak for the entire office

28:55.200 --> 28:57.031
when I tell you

28:58.040 --> 28:59.758
go fuck yourself.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.559
Yeah. That was great, bro. Who's the man?

29:23.720 --> 29:24.789
I'm the man.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.191
That's a bad idea.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.878
Couldn't find your keys, huh?

30:06.960 --> 30:08.632
That could be handy.
You going to teach me that?

30:08.720 --> 30:10.358
I might need that.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.431
So, Fox, right? What is that?
Is that a call sign?

30:14.520 --> 30:17.114
Is it like Maverick in <i>Top Gun?</i>

30:17.640 --> 30:20.108
You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me?

30:20.200 --> 30:21.918
I'm just kidding.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.034
Peter!

31:32.800 --> 31:36.918
Check the shuttle rotation on this STB.
It should be 300 per minute.

31:37.200 --> 31:40.397
This kind of cotton weave,
the opposing thread count should be 4,000.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.756
Hey, this is pretty awesome, huh?

31:45.120 --> 31:46.599
Is it a front?

31:48.480 --> 31:50.994
- Front for what?
- I don't know.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.559
Assassinations.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.632
You may think this is a front for something,

31:57.440 --> 32:00.318
all I can tell you is this is a textile mill.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.198
And George...
George, go help Peter up there.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.349
Yeah.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.557
This is a textile mill.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.069
And a damn good one.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.833
Yeah, that's cute,
but that's bullshit, right?

32:11.920 --> 32:15.037
I mean, all these guys are killers,
aren't they?

32:17.280 --> 32:19.316
I think you owe me some answers.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.360
All right. Clearly I don't understand,

32:22.440 --> 32:25.159
but do you make sweaters
or do you kill people?

32:44.880 --> 32:47.838
That's an awful lot of questions over coffee.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.596
Are you sure you're ready for the answers?

32:58.680 --> 33:00.272
Yes, I'm sure.

33:01.160 --> 33:02.912
I can't go back.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.592
Not to my life.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.473
He's all yours.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.112
All right. We're up.

33:23.480 --> 33:24.993
How you doing?

33:26.080 --> 33:27.593
I'm The Repairman.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.352
What do you repair?

33:29.720 --> 33:33.599
A lifetime of bad habits.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.995
- Okay.
- Would you do me a favour?

33:36.080 --> 33:38.548
Just put your arms behind your back.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.949
- It's okay.
- I don't know...

33:41.040 --> 33:42.632
- Just behind your back.
- Is this okay?

33:42.720 --> 33:43.994
Just relax.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.752
Is this part of it?

33:46.880 --> 33:48.279
There we go.

33:48.640 --> 33:52.838
- You going to put a bag over my head?
- No. There's no need for a bag.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.992
- That's not too tight, is it?
- No, that's nice.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.352
Why did you come here, Wesley?

34:06.440 --> 34:09.112
Well, you brought me here, remember?

34:09.199 --> 34:11.395
What the fuck did you do that...

34:26.639 --> 34:28.232
How many punches
did The Repairman throw

34:28.320 --> 34:30.550
before he was counting sheep?

34:32.000 --> 34:35.993
Well, I haven't spent a lot of time
having my face smashed in before, all right?

34:36.080 --> 34:40.437
- Did you spend a lot of time with knives?
- At breakfast, lunch and dinner.

34:41.719 --> 34:42.869
Fuck.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.909
It was a rhetorical question, <i>culo.</i>

34:49.000 --> 34:52.150
You interrupt me again,
I use the business end.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.917
Here's what you need to know, <i>puto.</i>

34:55.000 --> 34:57.116
Knives are easy to hide.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.598
They don't jam and they never
run out of bullets.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.110
They come in handy

35:05.200 --> 35:07.714
when you have to do some
close contact work.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.518
What the fuck, man?

35:16.960 --> 35:19.076
- Come here. Come here.
- What?

35:20.640 --> 35:22.710
Now, try to cut me.
- What?

35:24.320 --> 35:26.197
Try to cut me. Hey!

35:26.640 --> 35:30.474
- Just stick me with that...
- Be careful with that. That's sharp.

35:30.560 --> 35:33.438
- Just stick and stick and stick.
- Why?

35:33.520 --> 35:35.988
- Seriously, man, I could hurt you.
- Hey!

35:36.080 --> 35:37.911
Okay, pussy.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.752
- I'm not a pussy.
- You're a pussy.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.398
- No, I'm not a pussy.
- You're a pussy!

35:41.480 --> 35:44.358
I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect
for the human condition.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.078
- Fuck that, you pussy!
- I'm not a pussy!

35:46.160 --> 35:47.275
- You're a pussy!
- I'm not a pussy!

35:47.360 --> 35:49.715
- Come on, pussy.
- I'm not a pussy!

36:11.040 --> 36:12.792
Hi. How you doing?

36:12.880 --> 36:14.950
What the fuck?

36:15.520 --> 36:16.589
The fuck!

36:16.680 --> 36:18.875
Just a moment. Just a moment.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.435
Sorry.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.317
Hello? Hey!

36:23.400 --> 36:25.391
Hey, come back! Hey!

36:26.000 --> 36:28.070
You must drink. Drink. Yeah.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.758
- What is this?
- This is the recovery room.

36:38.320 --> 36:42.677
This bath stimulates white blood cells
and speed up the process.

36:42.760 --> 36:46.116
In here, bruises, cuts, breaks
heal in hours, not days.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.152
You shitting me?

36:50.160 --> 36:51.798
- What is that? Vodka?
- Yeah.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.711
- Are you Russian?
- Yeah.

36:54.800 --> 36:55.994
Get up.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.113
This is The Gunsmith.

36:59.200 --> 37:03.990
He knows more about a piece than anybody,
and he's gonna teach you how to use one.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.275
- How you doing?
- Pretty good.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.075
- You know that Seltzer broke his leg?
- Oh, really?

37:11.160 --> 37:12.991
Yeah, in three places.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.793
How'd he do that?
- Jumped off a building.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.996
So, is he okay?
- Yeah. It's pretty bad, though.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.593
Oh, my God.

37:23.240 --> 37:26.118
Oh, my God, you guys, that is so realistic.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.029
He's been in recovery for, like,
three days now,

37:30.120 --> 37:33.112
and they say they're not even
gonna let him out.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.832
Oh, my God.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.473
Oh, my God.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.154
Oh, my God!

37:48.240 --> 37:51.516
Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman!
She might be somebody's mom...

37:53.560 --> 37:57.109
You need to know what it's like
to put a bullet in a body.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.272
Why are you here?

37:59.960 --> 38:04.112
You know, I thought I was learning to be
some kind of super assassin.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.629
You know, if I wanted to get beat up,

38:06.720 --> 38:09.598
I would have stayed in my cubicle,
you know.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.715
Fuck.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.510
All right, shoot the target.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.679
From there.

38:33.840 --> 38:37.879
- You want me shoot through Wilbur?
- I want you to curve the bullet.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.950
How am I suppose to do that?

38:41.040 --> 38:43.156
It's not a question of how,

38:43.520 --> 38:45.476
it's a question of what.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.597
If no one told you that bullets flew straight

38:48.680 --> 38:50.796
and I gave you a gun
and told you to hit the target,

38:50.880 --> 38:52.552
what would you do?

38:53.560 --> 38:55.790
Let your instincts guide you.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.516
How the hell did he do that?

39:11.600 --> 39:14.273
Can you do that? Can you do that? Hello?

39:18.400 --> 39:20.152
Hey, I think that's my old train.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.559
Still is.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.959
Shit! You fucking asshole!

39:33.040 --> 39:34.359
Come on!

39:38.600 --> 39:39.874
Let's go.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.269
Are you out of your fucking mind?

39:52.760 --> 39:56.230
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.955
Oh, God, I feel... I feel... I feel...

40:18.400 --> 40:20.152
I feel kind of good.

40:27.720 --> 40:31.793
He got Rictus.
Perfect shot. Impossible angle.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.268
Cross is taking us out one by one.

40:40.200 --> 40:43.112
And Wesley is the only one
who can get to him.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.115
Cross gets closer with each hour.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.112
Get back to work.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.588
See that?

40:56.080 --> 40:57.877
- It's a shuttle.
- Okay.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.309
I want you to try and catch it.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.918
You want me to stick my hand in there?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.036
Yes. I want you to catch it.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.754
You wanna put a gun to my head?

41:16.840 --> 41:18.637
I can just slow things down
like with the flies.

41:18.720 --> 41:21.632
You need to learn
to control that by yourself.

41:35.840 --> 41:37.432
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

41:38.000 --> 41:40.116
This is bullshit! Fuck this!

41:50.200 --> 41:52.077
How's it going today, Wesley?

41:52.160 --> 41:55.038
No. Fuck the loom and fuck The Repairman!

41:55.120 --> 41:58.795
I can shoot the wings off the back of a fly!
I'm ready!

41:58.880 --> 42:01.075
You're ready when Fox says you're ready.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.515
- Who put her in charge?
- I did.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.548
Wesley.

42:14.160 --> 42:16.958
People think you use cheese
to catch these beauties.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.634
But they go apeshit for peanut butter.

42:20.360 --> 42:24.148
Your father was a big fan of this. Watch.

42:27.560 --> 42:30.120
Plastic explosive and peanut butter!

42:30.880 --> 42:32.393
Sorry, Mickey.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.958
Five, four, three, two, one.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.551
Hey. Hey, Russian.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.518
Good for one. Yeah.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.589
Imagine if you had a thousand.

42:55.480 --> 42:58.199
They really fucked you up, didn't they?

42:58.840 --> 43:00.910
What the hell did they do to you?

43:02.120 --> 43:04.270
Throw you in front of a moving train
for no reason?

43:04.360 --> 43:06.351
Beat the shit out of you?

43:07.240 --> 43:12.268
You know, you can say it,
this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?

43:12.360 --> 43:13.634
Bullshit!

43:22.200 --> 43:24.156
Repairman. Five minutes.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.830
Heads up out of the question?

43:34.400 --> 43:35.594
Fuck.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.989
You're a waste of my fucking time!
Why are you here?

43:38.080 --> 43:39.991
I don't know, so hit me.

43:48.920 --> 43:52.435
- Why are you here?
- I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I?

43:54.160 --> 43:56.355
I wanna kick your fucking ass!

43:57.320 --> 43:59.072
Tell me what you want me to say.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.549
- Why are you here?
- I don't know!

44:04.440 --> 44:06.078
Why are you here?

44:07.360 --> 44:09.635
- Why are you here?
- I don't know why I'm here.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.358
Why are you here?

44:14.280 --> 44:15.429
Why are you here?

44:15.520 --> 44:18.432
I don't know who I am.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.395
- What did you say?
- I said...

44:26.360 --> 44:28.476
I said I don't know who I am.

44:42.360 --> 44:45.079
Do you really want to know who you are?

44:56.800 --> 44:58.631
Yeah. It's my room.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.355
No.

45:02.040 --> 45:04.110
This was your father's room.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.233
What happened?

45:19.080 --> 45:21.719
A member
of this fraternity went rogue.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.309
Cross.

45:25.880 --> 45:29.429
He started by killing
the one man who was better than him.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.039
Your father.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.630
Blindsided him on a rooftop.

45:37.440 --> 45:38.873
Betrayed him.

45:41.880 --> 45:43.950
Everything in this room,

45:44.040 --> 45:47.476
books, weapons, clothes,

45:48.040 --> 45:49.712
belonged to him.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.711
Now they belong to you.

45:52.840 --> 45:55.479
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.

45:56.760 --> 45:59.832
It may be the only way
of finding out who you are.

46:18.800 --> 46:22.554
<i>Now I know why I could never care</i>
<i>about anything before this.</i>

46:23.480 --> 46:25.198
<i>I was living a lie.</i>

46:26.720 --> 46:30.156
<i>Finally, I have a chance to step</i>
<i>into my father's shoes.</i>

46:30.240 --> 46:33.596
<i>Grow a pair. Live the life I was born to live.</i>

46:34.360 --> 46:38.399
<i>I've been pissing it all away</i>
<i>like it was another fucking billing report.</i>

46:38.480 --> 46:40.072
<i>I have to train harder.</i>

46:40.160 --> 46:42.628
<i>I have to be as good as my father.</i>

46:50.920 --> 46:54.754
On these shelves, Wesley,
are the records of the Fraternity kills,

46:54.840 --> 46:57.912
everything you will need to kill your target.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.434
<i>To kill Cross,</i>

47:00.520 --> 47:05.116
<i>the man who betrayed the Fraternity</i>
<i>and murdered my father, I must prepare.</i>

47:05.200 --> 47:09.352
<i>I have to become his student,</i>
<i>memorise every move he ever made,</i>

47:09.440 --> 47:11.749
<i>every attack he ever executed.</i>

47:18.960 --> 47:23.431
<i>When he dropped a patient in an airtight</i>
<i>room surrounded by Secret Service agents.</i>

47:23.520 --> 47:26.193
<i>When he took out that</i>
<i>businessman in the elevator.</i>

47:26.280 --> 47:28.316
<i>His bullets untraceable, of course.</i>

47:30.680 --> 47:35.117
<i>Or how no matter what the weapon</i>
<i>or how he eliminated his target,</i>

47:36.600 --> 47:39.194
<i>he was always one chess move ahead.</i>

47:40.560 --> 47:42.357
<i>One move more prepared.</i>

47:42.800 --> 47:44.438
<i>One step quicker.</i>

47:44.680 --> 47:46.398
<i>One shot more precise.</i>

47:47.000 --> 47:51.312
<i>In fact, in all my research,</i>
<i>I found that he never missed a target.</i>

47:52.160 --> 47:53.639
<i>Not until me.</i>

48:58.359 --> 48:59.474
Yeah!

49:45.319 --> 49:49.392
First time in your life, Wesley,
you're in control.

50:26.159 --> 50:27.751
Shoot the target.

50:39.159 --> 50:40.592
You're crazy.

51:27.519 --> 51:29.589
Welcome to the Fraternity.

51:41.039 --> 51:43.633
We call this the Loom of Fate.

51:55.279 --> 51:59.636
After today,
you will never set foot in here again.

51:59.719 --> 52:00.993
Why not?

52:01.399 --> 52:03.355
Because, like an apostle,

52:03.919 --> 52:07.912
your task is not to interpret, but to deliver.

52:10.399 --> 52:13.357
Every culture in history has a secret code,

52:13.679 --> 52:16.398
one you won't find in traditional texts.

52:17.639 --> 52:19.630
<i>A thousand years ago,</i>

52:19.719 --> 52:23.871
<i>a clan of weavers discovered</i>
<i>a mystical language hidden in the fabric.</i>

52:25.319 --> 52:28.550
They called themselves the Fraternity.

52:28.639 --> 52:31.153
I'll be honest with you, all I see are threads.

52:32.239 --> 52:33.558
Come here.

52:37.479 --> 52:38.832
Look there.

52:39.999 --> 52:41.910
Do you see that one thread
that missed the weave

52:41.999 --> 52:43.478
and lies on top of the others?

52:43.559 --> 52:46.471
- Like a mistake?
- No, it's a code.

52:47.359 --> 52:50.556
If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one.

52:51.639 --> 52:53.869
If it's below, it's a zero.

52:54.919 --> 52:56.398
Binary code?

52:56.959 --> 52:58.312
What does it say?

52:59.039 --> 53:00.472
It's a name.

53:01.359 --> 53:02.712
A target.

53:04.879 --> 53:06.995
Where do the names come from?

53:07.799 --> 53:10.472
Come out of a necessity, Wesley.

53:10.559 --> 53:13.471
A necessity to maintain balance
in the world.

53:13.999 --> 53:16.593
They are orders that must be executed,

53:16.999 --> 53:22.232
entrusted to us so that we
might forge stability out of chaos.

53:24.679 --> 53:26.590
This one is yours.

53:30.559 --> 53:31.912
I don't...

53:33.719 --> 53:36.313
Look, I thought you brought me here
to kill Cross.

53:36.399 --> 53:37.627
You will.

53:37.719 --> 53:39.038
In time.

53:40.559 --> 53:42.629
This is your first assignment.

53:42.719 --> 53:44.789
The loom provides,

53:44.879 --> 53:46.710
I interpret,

53:46.799 --> 53:47.948
you deliver.

53:49.199 --> 53:51.429
You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?

53:53.919 --> 53:55.193
Not me.

53:56.639 --> 53:57.754
Fate.

54:04.879 --> 54:08.554
The target will be in the conference
room, sitting at the head chair.

54:08.639 --> 54:10.470
There are six windows.

54:10.959 --> 54:13.348
You will shoot through the fifth.

54:22.759 --> 54:24.238
Fifth window.

54:31.439 --> 54:32.554
Now.

54:55.479 --> 54:57.913
<i>What did he do</i>
<i>that he deserves to die?</i>

54:58.919 --> 55:00.432
<i>You don't know.</i>

55:01.439 --> 55:04.909
I don't know if he was bad,
I don't know if he was evil.

55:05.479 --> 55:07.754
I don't know anything about him.

55:08.879 --> 55:11.109
We get our orders from a loom.

55:11.959 --> 55:13.028
Fate.

55:13.359 --> 55:17.511
And we're supposed to take it on faith
that what we're doing is right.

55:18.999 --> 55:21.593
Killing someone we know nothing about,

55:23.679 --> 55:25.829
I don't know if I can do that.

55:37.719 --> 55:39.391
About 20 years ago,

55:40.799 --> 55:42.676
there was this girl.

55:43.759 --> 55:46.592
Her dad was a federal judge,

55:46.679 --> 55:51.195
so she probably had it in her mind
that she was gonna follow in his footsteps.

55:56.399 --> 55:58.549
<i>So she's home one Christmas,</i>

55:58.639 --> 56:01.517
<i>and her dad's on this big racketeering case.</i>

56:01.759 --> 56:04.717
<i>The defendants want to get a softer judge.</i>

56:05.159 --> 56:07.070
<i>One they can buy off.</i>

56:08.079 --> 56:10.035
<i>So they hire this guy,</i>

56:11.439 --> 56:12.997
<i>Max Petridge,</i>

56:14.439 --> 56:16.873
get him to pay her father a visit.

56:19.839 --> 56:22.399
And the way he pays people a visit

56:24.239 --> 56:25.228
<i>is to break in</i>

56:27.079 --> 56:29.388
<i>and tie up their loved ones,</i>

56:29.479 --> 56:31.674
<i>and force them to watch</i>

56:32.759 --> 56:35.227
<i>while he burns his targets alive.</i>

56:44.159 --> 56:47.390
And then he takes a wire hanger
and twists it round

56:48.479 --> 56:52.995
and brands his initials into each
one of them so they will never ever forget.

56:57.639 --> 57:00.392
After I was recruited into the Fraternity,

57:00.679 --> 57:03.671
I found out that Max Petridge's name
had come up

57:03.999 --> 57:06.877
weeks before the federal judge was killed,

57:07.559 --> 57:11.552
and that a Fraternity member
had failed to pull the trigger.

57:15.399 --> 57:18.755
We don't know how far
the ripples of our decisions go.

57:20.999 --> 57:23.115
You kill one, and maybe,

57:23.879 --> 57:25.437
save a thousand.

57:26.599 --> 57:29.193
That's the code of the Fraternity.

57:29.279 --> 57:32.715
That's what we believe in,
and that's why we do it.

57:52.999 --> 57:54.068
Now!

58:36.999 --> 58:38.227
Cross.

58:38.319 --> 58:39.547
Not yet.

58:42.199 --> 58:44.349
<i>Your target will be in a black limo.</i>

58:44.439 --> 58:47.033
<i>He always travels the same</i>
<i>six blocks of Halsted.</i>

58:47.119 --> 58:49.075
<i>You have three blocks to kill him.</i>

58:57.239 --> 58:58.388
Shit.

59:39.879 --> 59:41.790
I'm sorry.

59:58.999 --> 01:00:01.433
Barry! Could you feed Annabelle?

01:00:02.359 --> 01:00:03.633
Barry!

01:00:06.919 --> 01:00:11.709
Wesley. Hey, where have you been?
I have really missed you, man.

01:00:14.439 --> 01:00:17.670
Look at the big man.
You fucking asshole! What?

01:00:17.759 --> 01:00:18.908
What? You don't show up for weeks,

01:00:18.999 --> 01:00:21.513
now you're just gonna stop by
and use the bathroom?

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:23.988
You think you're a real big shot now, huh?

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.354
No. You know what? You are nothing!

01:00:26.439 --> 01:00:28.714
No, you are less than nothing.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:31.957
You're not even half the man that Barry is.

01:00:32.399 --> 01:00:36.312
Barry, he pleases me in ways
that you've never even heard of!

01:00:40.239 --> 01:00:43.231
Who the hell is she, Wesley?
Your new whore?

01:00:43.319 --> 01:00:46.436
Is that what it takes now?
You're paying for it?

01:01:17.639 --> 01:01:18.913
Wesley?

01:01:20.359 --> 01:01:21.792
He's the man.

01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:32.350
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:35.795
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- Go sit down. I'm gonna find a car.

01:01:35.879 --> 01:01:38.598
Big night. I got to get into recovery.

01:01:54.279 --> 01:01:55.428
Shit.

01:02:00.999 --> 01:02:02.114
Fuck!

01:03:38.599 --> 01:03:39.952
Bull's-eye.

01:03:41.999 --> 01:03:43.637
What's he doing here?

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:03.949
- Come on!
- Come on. Just stay with us.

01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:05.392
Pull back his jacket.

01:04:09.839 --> 01:04:12.558
Breathe. Breathe, all right?

01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:19.034
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:20.234
A thousand.

01:04:20.319 --> 01:04:21.638
Come on!

01:04:23.319 --> 01:04:25.275
- Come on!
- No! No! Stay with us.

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:26.428
- Come on.
- Open your eyes!

01:04:26.519 --> 01:04:27.793
Come on!

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:29.834
Come on!

01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:32.392
Come on!

01:05:20.639 --> 01:05:24.075
This bullet is the first traceable bullet
he's ever used.

01:05:25.519 --> 01:05:28.591
It was made by this man.
His name is Pekwarsky.

01:05:28.679 --> 01:05:32.035
He works out of what is now
a monastery in Eastern Moravia.

01:05:32.119 --> 01:05:34.917
This place is where the Fraternity was born.

01:05:39.759 --> 01:05:41.636
He's taunting me.

01:05:41.719 --> 01:05:43.675
He's sending me a message.

01:05:43.759 --> 01:05:45.192
I'm gonna send him one back.

01:05:45.279 --> 01:05:47.110
He's trapping you.

01:05:47.199 --> 01:05:49.474
Leading you to a place he knows very well.

01:05:49.559 --> 01:05:51.356
Look, I know this. I...

01:05:53.399 --> 01:05:55.867
This is what you trained me for.

01:05:55.959 --> 01:05:57.278
You can't go alone.

01:05:57.359 --> 01:06:00.351
I go alone or he doesn't show.
He's not stupid.

01:06:00.719 --> 01:06:05.190
Look, a member of the Fraternity
is dead because of me.

01:06:10.479 --> 01:06:11.548
Okay.

01:06:13.799 --> 01:06:14.868
Go.

01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:19.952
Thank you.

01:06:27.479 --> 01:06:29.947
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:06:39.319 --> 01:06:41.071
Your next assignment.

01:07:38.239 --> 01:07:39.513
Pekwarsky?

01:07:54.079 --> 01:07:55.148
Shit.

01:08:02.799 --> 01:08:04.710
What are you doing here?

01:08:05.919 --> 01:08:07.511
Lower your gun.

01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:19.356
You recognise this?

01:08:20.038 --> 01:08:21.267
I pulled this out of my shoulder.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:23.827
The guy who put it there killed my father.

01:08:23.919 --> 01:08:26.035
Now, I know you made it,
so tell me where he is.

01:08:26.118 --> 01:08:29.907
I did mould this, but I can't be responsible
for the people who use them.

01:08:29.999 --> 01:08:32.877
I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is.

01:08:32.959 --> 01:08:34.551
Look at my finger.

01:08:36.198 --> 01:08:39.077
I can try and arrange a meet.

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:04.317
Have you ever thought about
doing things differently?

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:05.957
How do you mean?

01:09:06.038 --> 01:09:07.518
I don't know.

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:10.549
Being somebody else.

01:09:11.519 --> 01:09:13.430
Somebody normal.

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:21.314
No.

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:28.154
Shit.

01:09:29.919 --> 01:09:31.432
Out of the way!

01:10:00.519 --> 01:10:01.668
Stay.

01:10:21.639 --> 01:10:22.708
Hey!

01:10:24.919 --> 01:10:26.637
He's on the train.

01:10:27.039 --> 01:10:28.392
<i>He's alone.</i>

01:10:28.799 --> 01:10:30.152
Thank you.

01:10:52.599 --> 01:10:54.112
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!

01:10:54.199 --> 01:10:56.588
Sir, sit down! Nobody's gonna get hurt.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.638
Sir, sit... Sit down! Sir, sit down!

01:11:11.199 --> 01:11:13.952
Get out of the way! Sit down!
Stay down! Stay down!

01:11:14.039 --> 01:11:15.791
Stay down! It's okay! Sit down!

01:11:25.879 --> 01:11:27.107
Wesley.

01:11:35.439 --> 01:11:37.634
Out of the way! Out of the way!

01:12:46.119 --> 01:12:47.711
No, no, no!

01:15:17.119 --> 01:15:19.713
Wesley, listen to me.

01:15:19.799 --> 01:15:21.676
Shut the fuck up!

01:15:21.759 --> 01:15:23.829
You don't get to talk to me.

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.398
You don't get to talk to me.

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:28.152
Everything they told you was a lie.

01:15:28.999 --> 01:15:32.196
Shut up, you lying piece of shit.
You shut the fuck up.

01:15:33.119 --> 01:15:34.677
You are my son.

01:15:39.519 --> 01:15:41.111
What did you say?

01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:43.635
What did you say to me?

01:16:14.119 --> 01:16:15.552
Is it true?

01:16:18.119 --> 01:16:19.234
Yes.

01:16:23.399 --> 01:16:24.832
Why did you make me do this?

01:16:24.919 --> 01:16:27.991
Because you are the only person
he wouldn't kill.

01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:34.477
You knew, God damn it.

01:16:34.799 --> 01:16:36.755
You knew the entire time.

01:16:37.839 --> 01:16:39.670
Well, his name came up.

01:16:41.599 --> 01:16:43.157
So did yours.

01:17:27.479 --> 01:17:29.549
No, it was okay. Never mind.

01:17:30.919 --> 01:17:33.433
No. No, it was complete shit.

01:17:53.279 --> 01:17:55.429
I promised your father
I'd bring you back here.

01:17:55.519 --> 01:17:56.998
What the fuck?

01:17:58.119 --> 01:18:01.031
He said it was the only way you'd believe.

01:18:08.039 --> 01:18:11.270
Your father was never more than
a camera click away.

01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:28.953
That's me.

01:18:32.999 --> 01:18:34.671
He was my father.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:38.517
And I killed him.

01:18:38.599 --> 01:18:42.672
To your father, protecting you
was worth giving up his life.

01:18:43.879 --> 01:18:45.232
Protect me?

01:18:45.999 --> 01:18:48.274
He was trying to fucking kill me!

01:18:48.359 --> 01:18:51.874
No. He wasn't trying to kill you.

01:18:52.599 --> 01:18:54.669
He was trying to rescue you.

01:19:00.399 --> 01:19:02.788
<i>When Cross left the Fraternity,</i>

01:19:02.879 --> 01:19:04.756
<i>Sloan hunted you down.</i>

01:19:06.519 --> 01:19:11.195
<i>Ever since Fox had her teeth in you,</i>
<i>he's been trying to separate you from them.</i>

01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:17.235
<i>Your father never wanted you</i>
<i>in the Fraternity, Wesley.</i>

01:19:18.359 --> 01:19:20.919
<i>He wanted a different path for you,</i>

01:19:25.999 --> 01:19:28.593
with things that he could never have.

01:19:29.279 --> 01:19:30.553
A home.

01:19:31.479 --> 01:19:33.071
- Peace.
- No.

01:19:33.679 --> 01:19:36.512
He hoped you would find your own way.

01:19:42.839 --> 01:19:45.069
Your father got hold of this.

01:19:46.959 --> 01:19:48.870
Decipher it yourself.

01:19:55.799 --> 01:20:00.111
Sloan began manufacturing targets
of his own for profit years ago.

01:20:02.039 --> 01:20:04.269
Your father found out about it.

01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:06.989
And he was going to do something about it
on his own, right?

01:20:07.079 --> 01:20:09.798
But Sloan turned everyone against him.

01:20:09.879 --> 01:20:12.234
My father's name
never even came up, did it?

01:20:12.359 --> 01:20:15.237
No. Holding to the code made him a target.

01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:20.748
Yes.

01:20:34.599 --> 01:20:36.874
- You want me to run?
- No.

01:20:37.519 --> 01:20:39.237
I want you to live.

01:20:40.559 --> 01:20:43.198
You can have a different life, Wesley.

01:20:44.079 --> 01:20:46.513
Like your father wanted for you.

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:11.511
We trained him well.

01:22:53.599 --> 01:22:55.794
<i>My father was wrong</i>
<i>about one thing.</i>

01:22:55.879 --> 01:22:58.473
<i>Everything they told me wasn't a lie.</i>

01:22:58.559 --> 01:23:01.710
<i>They taught me how to kill,</i>
<i>how to feel no pain,</i>

01:23:01.799 --> 01:23:05.587
<i>and most importantly,</i>
<i>that every job has a perfect weapon.</i>

01:23:08.999 --> 01:23:11.467
<i>Well, I'm the perfect weapon.</i>

01:23:13.439 --> 01:23:15.430
<i>And I'm supposed to run?</i>

01:23:15.519 --> 01:23:17.987
<i>No, I've been doing that my entire life.</i>

01:23:18.519 --> 01:23:19.838
<i>So I say no.</i>

01:23:20.759 --> 01:23:24.195
<i>I say kill them all</i>
<i>and let fate sort out the mess.</i>

01:24:16.839 --> 01:24:18.067
Kill him.

01:25:08.999 --> 01:25:10.318
He's here!

01:28:12.599 --> 01:28:13.827
Pussy.

01:28:15.119 --> 01:28:16.791
Pussy, pussy.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:32.038
Pussy, pussy.

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:38.107
Pussy.

01:29:40.839 --> 01:29:43.034
Sloan!

01:30:00.239 --> 01:30:02.469
My father wasn't a traitor.

01:30:05.759 --> 01:30:07.511
This is a kill order.

01:30:10.079 --> 01:30:12.309
And it's got Sloan's name on it.

01:30:15.599 --> 01:30:17.510
What did you say to me?

01:30:18.159 --> 01:30:20.309
It's a name. It's a target.

01:30:23.279 --> 01:30:25.509
I don't want this person dead.

01:30:26.359 --> 01:30:27.792
Fate does.

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:33.195
Fate wanted you dead.

01:30:35.159 --> 01:30:36.751
And he couldn't take it.

01:30:36.839 --> 01:30:40.718
So he started manufacturing
his own targets for his own gains.

01:30:41.359 --> 01:30:45.352
And that's when my dad found out
and decided to stand against him.

01:30:46.359 --> 01:30:49.954
And that's when you sent a man's son

01:30:50.039 --> 01:30:51.870
to kill his father.

01:30:54.799 --> 01:30:57.518
You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan.

01:30:59.279 --> 01:31:01.918
You're just a thug who can bend bullets.

01:31:17.799 --> 01:31:19.278
Is that true?

01:31:25.959 --> 01:31:27.995
Here is what the truth is.

01:31:31.879 --> 01:31:33.392
Your name came up.

01:31:44.159 --> 01:31:45.797
Your name came up.

01:32:00.439 --> 01:32:02.111
Your name came up.

01:32:04.039 --> 01:32:05.313
Your name.

01:32:06.839 --> 01:32:08.192
Your name.

01:32:08.839 --> 01:32:10.113
Yours.

01:32:11.239 --> 01:32:13.434
Everyone in this room.

01:32:18.759 --> 01:32:21.148
If I had not done what I did,

01:32:23.399 --> 01:32:25.310
you would all be dead.

01:32:27.839 --> 01:32:29.750
I saved your lives.

01:32:31.359 --> 01:32:35.147
Now look where we are.
We are stronger than ever.

01:32:36.319 --> 01:32:39.197
Changing the course of history as we see it.

01:32:41.119 --> 01:32:43.394
Choosing the targets we select.

01:32:45.319 --> 01:32:49.073
We can redistribute power where we see fit.

01:32:51.519 --> 01:32:53.032
The wolves rule.

01:32:54.879 --> 01:32:56.358
Not the sheep.

01:32:58.319 --> 01:33:01.516
Now, if any of you feel
the need to follow the code

01:33:01.599 --> 01:33:03.954
of the Fraternity to the letter,

01:33:05.879 --> 01:33:08.347
I invite you to take your gun,

01:33:08.439 --> 01:33:11.192
put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.

01:33:15.119 --> 01:33:17.235
That is what Wesley demands.

01:33:18.839 --> 01:33:20.158
Otherwise,

01:33:20.759 --> 01:33:22.556
shoot this motherfucker

01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:25.790
and let us take our
Fraternity of Assassins to heights

01:33:25.879 --> 01:33:28.393
reserved only for the gods of men.

01:33:32.119 --> 01:33:33.472
You choose.

01:33:47.919 --> 01:33:49.432
Fuck the code.

01:34:50.599 --> 01:34:52.351
Sloan!

01:35:16.519 --> 01:35:18.908
Sloan!

01:35:34.719 --> 01:35:38.268
<i>Six weeks ago,</i>
<i>I was ordinary and pathetic.</i>

01:35:40.319 --> 01:35:41.877
<i>Just like you.</i>

01:35:44.959 --> 01:35:46.551
<i>But who am I now?</i>

01:35:48.959 --> 01:35:50.517
<i>Account manager?</i>

01:35:52.799 --> 01:35:54.073
<i>Assassin?</i>

01:35:55.999 --> 01:36:00.038
<i>Or just another tool who was</i>
<i>mind-fucked into killing his father?</i>

01:36:01.959 --> 01:36:03.551
<i>I am all of these.</i>

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:06.397
<i>And I am none of these.</i>

01:36:09.039 --> 01:36:10.552
<i>Who am I now?</i>

01:36:40.719 --> 01:36:43.233
<i>This is not me fulfilling my destiny.</i>

01:36:48.199 --> 01:36:51.077
<i>This is not me following</i>
<i>in my father's footsteps.</i>

01:36:55.399 --> 01:36:58.232
<i>This is definitely not me saving the world.</i>

01:37:16.119 --> 01:37:18.758
Still trying to figure out who you are?

01:37:19.879 --> 01:37:21.870
<i>This is not me.</i>

01:37:24.639 --> 01:37:27.073
<i>This is just a motherfucking decoy.</i>

01:37:33.439 --> 01:37:34.758
Oh, fuck.

01:37:39.079 --> 01:37:41.388
<i>This is me taking control.</i>

01:37:42.759 --> 01:37:44.317
<i>From Sloan,</i>

01:37:45.079 --> 01:37:46.876
<i>from the Fraternity,</i>

01:37:47.239 --> 01:37:50.595
<i>from Janice, from billing reports,</i>

01:37:51.159 --> 01:37:53.275
<i>from ergonomic keyboards,</i>

01:37:53.359 --> 01:37:56.874
<i>from cheating girlfriends</i>
<i>and sack-of-shit best friends.</i>

01:37:58.599 --> 01:38:01.318
<i>This is me taking back control</i>

01:38:02.039 --> 01:38:03.518
<i>of my life.</i>

01:38:07.039 --> 01:38:10.007
What the fuck
have you done lately?
