09:58.913 --> 10:00.637
We gotta make a plan.

10:02.911 --> 10:04.321
Hotch: Go ahead, Kate.

10:04.323 --> 10:06.400
After we closed
the Riverside torso case,

10:06.402 --> 10:09.246
I couldn't let it go,
so I revisited the crime scenes

10:09.247 --> 10:11.232
and starting asking
questions.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.212
Aaron, you looked
at that case, too,

10:13.214 --> 10:14.363
and the evidence
indicated

10:14.365 --> 10:15.583
the torso killer
was working alone.

10:15.585 --> 10:16.926
Kate's working
a different tangent.

10:16.927 --> 10:18.881
I also kept tabs
on missing women.

10:18.883 --> 10:21.789
There was a female jogger
in Modesto, Eileen Banks,

10:21.791 --> 10:23.746
categorized
as voluntary missing,

10:23.747 --> 10:25.918
but oddly killed in a car accident
a few weeks later

10:25.920 --> 10:27.744
all the way in Maryland.
She was never autopsied.

10:27.746 --> 10:29.026
How is that
related to this?

10:29.028 --> 10:31.581
She had been flirting
on line with a young new boyfriend

10:31.583 --> 10:32.709
before she ran off,

10:32.733 --> 10:35.426
but it was the same Bobby
in that picture from Sam.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.664
It must have been the same group
that took the girls.

10:37.667 --> 10:40.037
If this is related to that case,
then these abductors are mobile.

10:40.038 --> 10:42.339
We'll get an emergency warrant,
we'll exhume the jogger's body

10:42.341 --> 10:43.459
and do an autopsy.

10:43.461 --> 10:44.580
I'll expedite it
with judge Lynch.

10:44.582 --> 10:46.023
They were taken
because of me.

10:46.025 --> 10:46.982
I was getting close.

10:46.984 --> 10:48.195
You were doing
your job, Kate.

10:48.197 --> 10:50.759
The unsub knew that grabbing
an FBI agent's daughter

10:50.760 --> 10:52.039
would bring a firestorm
down upon him.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.989
He's an extreme
risk-taker.

10:53.991 --> 10:55.625
Ok, I got the 411
on this Bobby photo.

10:55.627 --> 10:58.665
It originated 6 years ago.
Guy's name is Sven Sorensen,

10:58.667 --> 10:59.786
from Sweden.

10:59.788 --> 11:01.738
He's now 25.
He still lives in Europe.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.503
They used the picture
to lure the girls.

11:03.505 --> 11:05.583
Whoever did this
is most likely not a pedophile,

11:05.585 --> 11:07.148
but rather a preferential
adult offender

11:07.150 --> 11:08.590
and long-term
child abductor.

11:08.593 --> 11:10.348
But he targeted the girls.

11:10.350 --> 11:12.719
Yeah, because
I was targeting him.

11:14.355 --> 11:16.463
[Whispering] I don't know, Meg.
I don't know.

11:16.465 --> 11:18.765
If we don't, we're not
getting out of here alive.

11:18.766 --> 11:20.145
I can't.
You have to.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.154
Shut up!
Time to go.

11:22.157 --> 11:23.567
Why are you doing this
to us?

11:23.568 --> 11:24.878
You don't have to hurt us.

11:24.880 --> 11:25.869
Please, we'll be good.

11:25.871 --> 11:27.696
Shut up.

11:27.698 --> 11:29.107
[Grunts] Let's go.

11:29.109 --> 11:31.410
No--let go of me!
Meg! Meg!

11:31.411 --> 11:33.649
Not only did they wipe
the girls' devices clean,

11:33.652 --> 11:36.244
they went after Kate because she
was digging into missing persons cases.

11:36.246 --> 11:37.486
Because Kate
was onto something.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.898
Yeah, this isn't some loner

11:38.899 --> 11:40.623
who wants to keep girls
in a dungeon. This feels like trafficking.

11:40.626 --> 11:41.936
That's the worst-case scenario.

11:41.938 --> 11:43.409
Well, if it is trafficking,
the upside is

11:43.411 --> 11:45.487
we've got a better chance
of finding the girls alive.

11:45.489 --> 11:47.405
Yeah, but if they
don't comply,

11:47.407 --> 11:49.009
they'll be beaten
into submission

11:49.011 --> 11:51.602
or killed
if they try to escape.

12:08.116 --> 12:09.971
It went better than expected.

12:09.972 --> 12:12.686
You know, you've never
let me down, Paige.

12:12.688 --> 12:15.118
You'll always be my
most prized possession.

12:15.925 --> 12:17.519
Show me.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.136
Get up.

12:25.138 --> 12:27.307
Sit up.

12:31.828 --> 12:33.554
They're perfect.

12:33.556 --> 12:35.028
And no visible bruising.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.725
You're learning.

12:36.727 --> 12:38.452
I know what I'm doing.

12:39.382 --> 12:40.470
Let's go.

12:40.472 --> 12:41.682
Get rid of the van,

12:41.684 --> 12:43.125
meet us back at home
in about two hours.

12:43.127 --> 12:44.084
Uhh!

12:44.086 --> 12:45.266
Markayla, run!

12:45.268 --> 12:46.678
Kyle!

12:46.680 --> 12:48.759
You watch that one.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.468
Uhh!

13:02.326 --> 13:03.292
Kyle!

13:03.294 --> 13:05.403
Over here!

13:06.204 --> 13:08.312
Where the hell is she?

13:09.119 --> 13:11.196
You let her get away?

13:11.198 --> 13:12.923
It's dark. She's fast.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.297
You idiot.

13:14.299 --> 13:15.739
You've always been
a moron.

13:15.741 --> 13:19.483
Don't talk to me like that.
I've warned you--

14:02.709 --> 14:04.464
Help me! Help me, please!
Let me in!

14:04.465 --> 14:05.553
Get away from my house.

14:05.555 --> 14:08.591
I've a gun.
I'll shoot!

14:15.031 --> 14:17.362
Help me! Help me, please!

14:17.363 --> 14:19.792
Oh, God, honey,
what happened?

14:23.346 --> 14:24.948
She's frightened
and in shock,

14:24.949 --> 14:26.797
but doctors say
she'll be fine.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.693
Markayla.

14:28.695 --> 14:29.967
Mom!

14:29.969 --> 14:32.370
[Crying]

14:39.725 --> 14:41.610
He killed him.

14:41.612 --> 14:43.427
He killed him
right in front of me.

14:43.428 --> 14:47.076
JJ: It's ok, Markayla.
You're ok now.

14:47.078 --> 14:50.848
But we need to know, who were
you meeting at the library?

14:50.850 --> 14:52.898
It was supposed
to be Bobby.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.802
We were talking to him
for a few months online.

14:55.804 --> 14:57.181
He seemed so cool.

14:57.183 --> 14:59.642
He said he had tickets
to the 4for1 concert tonight,

14:59.644 --> 15:00.853
but he got stuck
at work,

15:00.855 --> 15:03.676
so his mom picked us up
instead.

15:03.678 --> 15:05.403
And she was driving
the van?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.731
Yes. And she seemed
nice, too,

15:07.733 --> 15:09.716
until we started
asking about Bobby.

15:09.717 --> 15:10.704
And what did she do?

15:10.706 --> 15:12.431
She locked the doors.

15:12.432 --> 15:14.831
Suddenly this guy
popped up from the back

15:14.833 --> 15:16.465
and stabbed us
in the neck.

15:18.164 --> 15:20.302
Can you describe
either of them?

15:20.304 --> 15:23.412
They were white
with brown hair.

15:23.414 --> 15:25.784
The creepy guy they gave us to
had a wide face.

15:25.786 --> 15:27.863
They're perfect.

15:27.865 --> 15:30.264
I'll get a sketch artist.

15:30.266 --> 15:31.414
We had a plan.

15:31.416 --> 15:32.501
What was the plan?

15:32.503 --> 15:34.862
Meg said Kate taught her
what to do.

15:34.864 --> 15:37.585
If they try to hurt us,
we buy time.

15:37.587 --> 15:40.176
We role play,
get into their heads.

15:40.178 --> 15:42.024
When they move us,
I'll distract them.

15:42.026 --> 15:45.190
It's our best opportunity
for you to run and get help.

15:45.191 --> 15:47.813
That's right. Kidnappers
are most vulnerable at transfer points.

15:47.815 --> 15:51.111
Did the older man say anything
about where he was taking you?

15:51.113 --> 15:53.221
No, he just said
he had plans for us.

15:53.223 --> 15:55.146
And then I ran. And that's when he
shot the younger guy

15:55.148 --> 15:57.993
for losing me.
Look, I didn't want to leave Meg,

15:57.995 --> 16:00.488
but she said you guys
would never stop looking for her.

16:00.489 --> 16:01.799
That's what she said.

16:01.801 --> 16:03.079
That's what she said.

16:03.081 --> 16:04.483
Ok.

16:08.650 --> 16:10.505
Did you get all that, Kate?

16:10.507 --> 16:12.040
I told Meg everything.

16:12.042 --> 16:14.596
I told her about sadists and that
the only way to undermine them

16:14.597 --> 16:16.199
was to not show fear.

16:16.201 --> 16:19.233
You taught her well, Kate.

16:19.235 --> 16:21.340
She can get through this.

16:21.342 --> 16:22.780
Meg Callahan
has been abducted

16:22.782 --> 16:24.695
by a sophisticated
sex trafficking ring.

16:24.697 --> 16:26.136
Canning:
It's a mobile operation.

16:26.138 --> 16:28.759
That's why it's gone
undetected for so long.

16:28.761 --> 16:30.131
Morgan: A broker
leads the ring

16:30.132 --> 16:32.752
with a male accomplice
and a female accomplice.

16:32.754 --> 16:34.644
Reid: They find victims
and tailor their abduction plan

16:34.646 --> 16:36.723
to each of their
vulnerabilities.

16:36.725 --> 16:38.703
Hotch: And then the victims
are sold, most likely online

16:38.706 --> 16:41.971
to buyers who've been
vetted by their team.

16:41.973 --> 16:43.374
If it's trafficking,

16:43.376 --> 16:45.257
couldn't the girl be on a ship
to Saudi Arabia by now?

16:45.259 --> 16:46.699
Well, we're hoping
they lay low

16:46.700 --> 16:48.201
until the searchers
are called off.

16:48.203 --> 16:49.643
A male accomplice
was shot dead by the broker,

16:49.646 --> 16:51.077
suggesting infighting
and tension.

16:51.079 --> 16:52.358
This could give us
an opening.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.700
We'll continue
going door to door.

16:53.701 --> 16:55.712
Someone out there knows
the leader of this ring.

16:55.714 --> 16:56.990
Don't be fooled
by his facade.

16:56.993 --> 16:58.746
He is a master
manipulator.

16:58.748 --> 17:02.174
And his female accomplice
is possibly a compliant victim,

17:02.175 --> 17:04.988
who trauma bonded with the unsub
after years in captivity.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.227
The group's sophistication
level suggests they're experienced,

17:07.230 --> 17:10.011
so we can expect them
to employ forensic countermeasures

17:10.012 --> 17:12.883
to hide and change
the appearance of the victims

17:12.885 --> 17:14.799
before he sells them off.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.525
How does she look?

17:18.067 --> 17:19.598
Great.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.893
He hasn't been
answering his phone.

17:32.401 --> 17:34.095
I told him to get rid
of the body.

17:34.097 --> 17:35.891

You killed Markayla?

17:35.893 --> 17:38.356
Oh, my God,
why would you kill her?!

she's home safely.

17:53.169 --> 17:54.669
Thank you.

17:54.671 --> 17:57.775
The FBI has confirmed
that one of the girls taken

17:57.778 --> 18:00.652
is in fact related
to a local BAU agent.

18:00.654 --> 18:03.304
The agent, we're hearing,
is a renowned profiler

18:03.306 --> 18:05.320
who used to be with the
Bureau's sex crimes unit.

18:05.322 --> 18:06.247
[Changes channel]

18:06.249 --> 18:07.850
As the nationwide search
intensifies,

18:07.851 --> 18:10.977
communities are asking
how could this happen here?

18:10.980 --> 18:13.672
It's been over 3 years
since a double abduction

18:13.674 --> 18:14.853
has occurred in the area.

18:23.331 --> 18:26.950
We've got flyers all the way up
to Massachusetts Av.

18:26.953 --> 18:29.576
I just got off the phone
with Garcia.

18:29.578 --> 18:32.900
She's checked every
sex trafficking website and nothing.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.836
This is all my fault.
I promised Liz

18:36.837 --> 18:38.439
that I would protect Meg
and look what happened.

18:38.441 --> 18:39.690
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

18:39.692 --> 18:41.992
She never even told me
that she liked a boy.

18:51.851 --> 18:55.652
Use it.
Meg is depending on you.

18:59.808 --> 19:02.338
A lot of assumptions were made
with this victim, Eileen Banks.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.318
Badly burned, smashed car.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.273
That's why they didn't
autopsy her.

19:06.275 --> 19:07.515
Correct.

19:07.517 --> 19:09.976
Turns out, she had
multiple penetrating lacerations

19:09.978 --> 19:11.515
to her chest and neck.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.049
They appear to be
antemortem.

19:13.051 --> 19:16.057
Maybe one of the traffickers
killed her and then staged the accident.

19:16.058 --> 19:17.621
That seems pretty elaborate.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.154
The wounds weren't
inflicted all at once.

19:20.155 --> 19:22.295
She was stabbed
over the course of several days.

19:22.297 --> 19:23.608
JJ: Sadistic traffickers.

19:23.610 --> 19:26.263
Or worse, the unsub
wasn't trafficking at all.

19:26.264 --> 19:27.835
What are you thinking?

19:27.837 --> 19:30.391
Garcia should re-evaluate
every voluntary missing person case

19:30.393 --> 19:32.762
followed by accidental
or sudden death.

19:32.764 --> 19:34.619

than we thought.

but 2,500 miles apart.
