00:21.500 --> 00:24.000
DOWNFALL

00:25.300 --> 00:30.800
I feel as if I should be angry
with that child, that...

00:31.400 --> 00:35.400
naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her...

00:36.100 --> 00:39.600
for not recognising the
nature of that monster.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.600
For not being aware of what
she was getting into.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.700
And especially that I went
along without thinking.

00:48.400 --> 00:54.300
Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said, in Berlin:

00:54.700 --> 00:59.200
'No, I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Führer's headquarters. '

01:00.400 --> 01:03.400
But I didn't do that.
I was too curious.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
I also didn't realise...

01:08.200 --> 01:13.200
that destiny would take me somewhere
I didn't want to be.

01:14.500 --> 01:20.000
But, nevertheless, I find it hard
to forgive myself.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.300
The ladies are here.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.900
It's confirmed.
- They can pass.

02:02.100 --> 02:05.100
'Wolfsschanze'
headquarters of the Führer

02:06.300 --> 02:07.800
November 1942
Rastenburg, East-Prussia

02:11.500 --> 02:13.500
Sit down, ladies.

02:15.200 --> 02:20.200
One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.

02:22.500 --> 02:27.000
Can you tell us... How are we supposed
to address the Führer?

02:28.200 --> 02:32.200
The Führer first speaks to you
and then you reply: Heil, mein Führer.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.300
And the Nazi salute?

02:34.400 --> 02:36.800
That won't be necessary...

02:37.100 --> 02:42.100
since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier, but for a secretary.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.300
Act as normal and calm
as you can.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.400
I'll see if
he has time for you.

02:52.700 --> 02:55.700
Mein Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.

03:14.600 --> 03:20.100
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.300
Sometimes, during a war,
one is not in control of time.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.000
Can I ask your name?
- Margarethe Lorenz.

03:31.700 --> 03:34.200
Where are you from?
- From Fulda.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.300
And what is your name?
- Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, mein Führer.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
No need for that.
Where are you from?

03:42.600 --> 03:44.600
Frankfurt am Main, mein Füh...

03:46.800 --> 03:48.800
Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.900
In Pankow, to be precise.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.600
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Schwaben.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.700
And you are?
- Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.500
A lady from Munich.

04:12.900 --> 04:16.399
Shall we start then,
Fräulein Humps?

04:27.500 --> 04:31.000
My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.

04:31.700 --> 04:35.200
She's much smarter
than most people.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
First, sit down, please.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.600
Don't be nervous. I make
many mistakes during dictation.

04:47.900 --> 04:51.300
You won't make nearly as many.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.300
You're very young.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.400
How old are you?
- 22, mein Führer.

05:12.300 --> 05:16.300
My German fellow-countrymen
and women...

05:17.500 --> 05:18.500
...fellow party members.

05:18.600 --> 05:23.100
It is, I think, rather special...

05:23.800 --> 05:29.800
that, after 20 years of service, a man still
stands in front of his supporters...

05:33.200 --> 05:39.700
...and that in all those 20 years, his
program never needed to be modified.

05:55.100 --> 05:58.600
I suggest we try it again.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I did it.
He hired me.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.300
Berlin - 20 April 1945
Hitler's 56th birthday

06:32.900 --> 06:34.400
two and a half years later

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Take cover.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.100
Hurry. Continue.
Get that off the street.

06:46.700 --> 06:47.700
Take cover.

07:00.900 --> 07:01.900
That's artillery fire.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.400
Don't be silly.
Where would it be coming from?

07:07.100 --> 07:09.600
You're right. These are no planes,
this is artillery.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.300
It's the Russians.
What a birthday present.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.600
Where is that cannon fire coming from?

07:22.200 --> 07:24.700
Happy Birthday,
mein Führer.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.400
The city centre of Berlin
is under fire.

07:28.700 --> 07:32.200
Grenades have hit near the Brandenburger
Tor and the Reichstag.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.200
Where did they come from?
- We don't know yet.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.800
I have Koller on the line.
- Give me Koller.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.400
Koller, do you know Berlin
is under artillery fire?

07:44.700 --> 07:47.200
No.
- Can't you hear the shooting?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.800
No, I'm in Wildpark-Werder.
- Berlin is chaotic.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.900
Apparently, the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.100
The enemy has no railway
artillery near the Oder.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.700
It's not long-range artillery.

08:00.800 --> 08:05.800
The anti-aircraft defence near the
Zoo-Bunker reports they're 10 to 12...

08:06.000 --> 08:10.400
...cm calibres. The Russians have
positions near Marzahn.

08:10.700 --> 08:15.200
That's only 12 kilometres from the centre.
Are the Russians that close?

08:15.900 --> 08:19.400
They should hang the entire
Luftwaffe leadership.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.700
This is unheard-of.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.800
The Russians are at 12 kilometres
from the city centre.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.400
Nobody told me anything.
I had to ask.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.100
Maybe it's long-range artillery,
after all.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.700
That railway bridge over the Oder...
- Nonsense.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.600
That Himmler,
such a pompous buffoon.

08:47.200 --> 08:52.700
Party bosses, everywhere.
They make me so sick.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.600
The Führer starts
'Clausewitz' today.

08:58.700 --> 09:02.200
Berlin as a front city.
He won't be able to keep the city.

09:02.900 --> 09:05.900
If the Führer stays here,
the Reich will go down with him.

09:06.500 --> 09:10.000
We have to talk him out of it.
Talk to Hewel.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.700
He's the only diplomat
with any influence on him.

09:14.300 --> 09:17.300
Hewel tried everything.
It's useless.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.500
Talk to your sister-in-law, then.

09:21.100 --> 09:26.100
Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.300
We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.500
You're still young.
You'll be a father soon.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.600
Do you want to die here?
- Absolutely not.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Gentlemen, the Führer.

09:54.900 --> 09:58.400
Everything out. Quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.800
What's going on?
- We're leaving.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.500
'Clausewitz' has started.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.500
All the ministries and departments
are leaving Berlin.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.300
And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?

10:22.400 --> 10:25.900
Don't ask me, professor.
- This is insane.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.800
Professor.

10:46.900 --> 10:48.900
I won't allow the
evacuation of my office.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.500
Is that so?
- Food supply would collapse.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.700
A good soldier can
always find food.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.900
And when there's fighting all over the city,
where does he get it? The population.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.900
It's irresponsible.
- It's an order from the Führer.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.700
As department head, I
report to the SS and to Himmler.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.200
But as a doctor, I'm part of the Wehrmacht
and they're not leaving yet.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.400
Keep that in mind.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.700
The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.000
We're leaving.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.100
Everything for Germany.
Heil, mein Führer.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.300
Führer, I...
Heil, mein Führer.

11:53.900 --> 11:56.400
They're in such a hurry
to get away from here.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
The brown nosing is the worst.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.100
They say 'Sieg Heil'. but they think
'Lick my... you know what. '

12:07.300 --> 12:11.800
Mein Führer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.
It is not too late yet.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.600
Too late?

12:16.200 --> 12:18.200
Hewel, come here for a moment.

12:18.900 --> 12:23.400
I'm sure you agree we should contact
the Allies...

12:24.100 --> 12:29.100
...and start conducting politics.
- Certainly. We need politics.

12:29.400 --> 12:33.300
Politics?
I don't do politics anymore.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.000
I'm fed up with it.

12:38.200 --> 12:42.200
When I'm dead, you'll have plenty
of time for politics.

12:42.900 --> 12:48.600
It's good, dear Himmler.
My loyal Heinrich.

12:48.800 --> 12:53.500
It's good.
Just go.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.700
He has no strength left.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.200
What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaller?

13:20.900 --> 13:24.300
Seriously, though, Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.500
Berlin will fall in a couple of days.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.600
When the Führer's dead, who will
the Allies negotiate with?

13:32.900 --> 13:35.800
Why do you think they'll
negotiate with you?

13:36.600 --> 13:39.600
The Nazi state and my SS are needed
to maintain order.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.800
One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.

13:43.900 --> 13:47.900
The first contact has been made.
- Careful, that's high treason.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.000
Fegelein, I have other concerns.

13:51.200 --> 13:56.200
Should I give Eisenhower the Nazi salute
or shake his hand?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.500
Look at that.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.200
The best guests
always arrive late.

14:09.700 --> 14:14.700
Leaving already, gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.

14:15.500 --> 14:20.000
The scorched-earth order...
- I really have to go now.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.200
Come and see me one day
in Hohenlychen.

14:25.900 --> 14:30.900
I'm going north to help with the
battle of Berlin there.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.500
You know, Speer... There's an
advantage to those bombings.

14:46.200 --> 14:51.200
It's easier to clean up debris
than to demolish everything ourselves.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.500
When the war will be over,
reconstruction will be quick.

14:58.200 --> 15:03.700
We spent thousands of hours
together with these replicas.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.500
You're a true genius, Speer.

15:10.200 --> 15:15.700
Yes, absolutely. Only you and I know that
the Third Reich would be inconceivable...

15:16.500 --> 15:21.000
...with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.

15:22.200 --> 15:26.200
This Third Reich will be a treasury
full of art and culture...

15:26.900 --> 15:29.900
...that will survive thousands of years.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.300
We see, before us, the ancient cities,
the Acropolis...

15:35.000 --> 15:37.500
We see the medieval cities...
the cathedrals...

15:37.600 --> 15:42.100
...and we know that the people
need that.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.000
Indeed, Speer.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.700
That was my vision...

15:54.300 --> 15:56.800
...and it still is.

15:59.500 --> 16:04.500
Mein Führer, if you want to realize
these plans, you must leave Berlin.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.000
Eva, you say something.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.600
He's the Führer.
He knows what's best.

16:17.300 --> 16:21.800
You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.500
I can't do that, my child.

16:25.100 --> 16:30.500
I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.

16:30.700 --> 16:36.100
I have to solve the problem,
here in Berlin, or perish.

16:37.900 --> 16:38.900
Speer...

16:41.600 --> 16:43.100
...what do you think?

16:44.700 --> 16:47.700
You have to be on the stage
when the curtain falls.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.200
Reload.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.700
Go away. Leave me alone.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.900
How old are you? Twelve?
And you? Fourteen?

17:24.500 --> 17:27.500
Why are you here?
To play at war? Go home.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.700
Who are you? What do you want?
I want my son. Alive.

17:32.300 --> 17:35.300
You should be proud.
He destroyed two tanks.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
The Führer will decorate him
for it, today.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.600
You're still young.
At which front did you fight?

17:43.800 --> 17:45.300
I haven't had
the honour yet.

17:45.900 --> 17:50.400
Count yourself lucky.
Send the children home.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.600
We'll defend this position
to the last man.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.200
Which position?
This is not a position, it's a trap.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.400
The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.100
We'll shoot back.
- What with?

18:05.200 --> 18:06.700
With the anti-aircraft guns.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.800
The Russians will arrive with several
armies, tanks and heavy artillery.

18:11.400 --> 18:15.400
Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?

18:16.100 --> 18:18.600
We promised the Führer.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.300
Don't you understand?
The war is lost.

18:22.900 --> 18:23.900
Coward.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.600
Go away. Right now.

18:32.300 --> 18:36.300
If you're still here when the Russians
arrive, you'll all be dead.

18:40.100 --> 18:45.600
The 9th army had to retreat
or they would have been decimated...

18:46.400 --> 18:51.400
We won't retreat the 9th army.
Busse must fight where he stands.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.600
Führer, then the 9th army is lost.

18:55.200 --> 19:00.200
We'll push back the Soviet armies
in the north and east...

19:00.500 --> 19:05.000
...with a ruthless, mighty attack.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.200
Using which units?

19:08.300 --> 19:12.800
Steiner will attack from the north
and join the 9th army.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.600
The 9th army is unable to move.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.200
The enemy outnumbers us ten times.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.800
Wenck's 12th army must
support them.

19:24.400 --> 19:29.400
The 12th army is approaching the Elbe.
- Then it must turn around.

19:30.200 --> 19:34.200
Then the western front would be open.
- Do you doubt my orders?

19:34.900 --> 19:38.400
I think I've been
clear enough.

19:40.100 --> 19:47.100
The Allies will see that only we
can stop the Bolsheviks.

19:47.900 --> 19:52.400
We have to keep Berlin and
make a deal with the Americans.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.900
Mohnke, you're here.
- Mein Führer.

20:16.600 --> 20:21.100
Today, 'Clausewitz' started.
Berlin will be a front city.

20:21.800 --> 20:26.300
You will be the commander of the
defensive circle around the citadel.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
We'll fight until the last man, in Berlin.

20:31.700 --> 20:35.700
There are still three million civilians
here. They have to be evacuated.

20:37.400 --> 20:43.400
I understand your concern, Mohnke.
But we have to be cold as ice.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.700
We can't spend any energy
on so-called civilians.

20:49.400 --> 20:53.400
With all due respect, what will
happen to the women and children...

20:54.100 --> 20:56.600
...and the thousands of wounded
and elderly?

20:57.200 --> 21:00.700
In a war such as this one,
there are no civilians.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.900
The Führer has lost all
sense of reality.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.500
He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.

21:08.200 --> 21:13.200
Gruppe Steiner has been scattered,
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.

21:13.900 --> 21:17.400
But why don't you tell him that?
- He doesn't listen to reason.

21:18.100 --> 21:22.100
Something has to happen.
- Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.

21:24.900 --> 21:28.400
We're soldiers.
We took an oath.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.000
Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?

21:31.600 --> 21:34.600
And that's coming from you?
A ruthless careerist?

21:35.800 --> 21:36.800
I beg your pardon?

22:02.100 --> 22:04.100
Where were you?
- None of your business.

22:13.100 --> 22:17.100
The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler-Jugend stand before you.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
I'm proud of you.

22:31.300 --> 22:35.300
This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.500
His name is Peter Kranz.
- So you're Peter.

22:42.800 --> 22:46.300
I wish my generals were
as brave as you.

22:56.300 --> 22:57.300
Very good.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.900
You've made history.

23:06.500 --> 23:11.000
And when Germania will rise
from these ruins...

23:11.700 --> 23:13.700
...you will be the heroes.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.400
Heil, to you.

23:47.200 --> 23:51.200
I don't know about you,
but I prefer air raids.

23:52.400 --> 23:56.900
What will happen to us?
- I could go if I wanted to.

23:57.600 --> 24:02.100
But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go, can we?

24:02.800 --> 24:04.300
I can't go either.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.600
I wouldn't know
where to go.

24:13.300 --> 24:17.800
My parents and all
my friends warned me.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.000
Don't get involved with the Nazis.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.300
What should I say:
'Hello, I made a mistake'?

24:24.500 --> 24:27.200
'When things went wrong,
I admitted my mistake. '

24:29.400 --> 24:31.900
Life will go on.

24:40.500 --> 24:43.500
What do you think, Herr Oberst?
- We have to go.

24:46.700 --> 24:49.700
Go where?
- I don't know.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.400
Wherever they need us.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.900
Let's go upstairs.
We'll party.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.600
Come on.

25:12.300 --> 25:13.300
Come, children.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.100
We should have fun today.

25:29.100 --> 25:34.100
Wherever the enemy goes,
all they find is destruction.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.800
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

25:39.500 --> 25:43.000
No power, no gas, no drinking
water, no coal, no traffic.

25:44.200 --> 25:50.700
If you destroy everything, our country
will go back to the Middle Ages.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.500
This order denies the people
any chance of survival.

25:55.700 --> 25:59.700
If the war is lost, what does it matter
that the people are lost too?

26:00.400 --> 26:05.900
The primary necessities of life of the
German people aren't relevant, right now.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.600
On the contrary.
We'd best destroy them ourselves.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.800
Our people turned out weak...

26:13.400 --> 26:16.900
...and according to the laws of nature,
they should die out.

26:17.600 --> 26:20.600
They're your people.
You're their Führer.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.700
What remains after this battle...

26:24.300 --> 26:28.800
...is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.

26:36.100 --> 26:39.600
Come along. You have to dance.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.300
Care to dance, Fräulein Braun?
- I'd love to.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.100
May I?
- Go ahead.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.200
What's wrong?

27:18.500 --> 27:21.500
We have to leave Berlin, Eva.
You must convince him.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.300
Or else, come with me.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.800
You'll die.

27:59.100 --> 28:02.100
Can somebody play some music?
I want to dance.

28:02.800 --> 28:03.800
Dance.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Do you have a request?
- As long as it swings.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.000
Traudl.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.400
It's all so unreal.

28:49.200 --> 28:54.600
It's like a dream you
can't get out of.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.800
It keeps on going.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.700
Gerda, I don't feel well.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.700
Traudl, come.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.400
I did not move...

30:05.500 --> 30:08.000
I did not move
my command post.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.500
To the west? How so?

30:12.600 --> 30:15.200
I'm at 1000 meters from the enemy.
- General.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.700
And, general?

30:37.900 --> 30:40.900
I'll be executed.
- What? Why?

30:42.100 --> 30:46.100
They think I moved my
command post to the west.

30:47.300 --> 30:49.800
Be sensible, general.
- Come along.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.000
Schenck.
- Mohnke.

31:09.600 --> 31:14.100
I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commander of the citadel now.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.800
I need help.
- That will be difficult. Everything's gone.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.500
My assistant and I are
the only ones here.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.600
You're a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes, an internist.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.200
Commandeer a car and
bring all the medication...

31:29.900 --> 31:32.400
...you can find, to me.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
I'll do my best.
- Thanks. Hurry.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.300
I need to talk to the Führer.

32:29.400 --> 32:33.000
What about?
- I'm going to be executed.

32:36.700 --> 32:37.700
Wait here.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.400
Your weapon, please.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.700
Not here.

32:52.300 --> 32:55.800
Guard post 2.
Understood.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.600
General...

33:02.200 --> 33:03.700
Not you.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.800
What's going on here?
Why am I going to be executed?

33:30.400 --> 33:34.400
You know that any evasive manoeuvre
towards the west is forbidden.

33:35.100 --> 33:39.600
Officers who don't obey,
must be executed.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.300
What do you mean?
My troops have been fighting for days.

33:44.500 --> 33:48.500
My command post
is a kilometre away from the front line.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.700
Continue.

33:50.700 --> 33:55.200
Do you see this? I don't want you
to use that tone with me.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
And now, do whatever
you feel you must.

34:00.600 --> 34:04.600
It's best if you tell this to the
Führer yourself. Come along.

34:20.100 --> 34:24.100
You can't pass, Oberst.
- Orders from brigade führer Mohnke:

34:24.400 --> 34:27.300
I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.500
There's nobody left.
They all took off.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.600
And the wounded?
- How should I know?

34:34.199 --> 34:36.199
I'm going to have a look.
You stay here.

34:36.500 --> 34:40.500
Be very careful.
There are lots of Russians here.

34:41.500 --> 34:46.000
See that? That's where the
Reich ends. Behind it, is Russkie land.

34:58.100 --> 34:59.500
May I?

34:59.700 --> 35:10.200
He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?

36:11.900 --> 36:15.300
I should have been back by now.
Are you sure the Führer still needs me?

36:16.100 --> 36:19.100
Drink.
- Führer's orders.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.600
You made a big impression
on the Führer.

36:23.300 --> 36:25.300
But you don't think Steiner
will attack, do you?

36:25.900 --> 36:28.400
I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything...

36:29.000 --> 36:31.500
...but you probably know that
better than I do.

36:32.700 --> 36:35.700
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin is lost.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.500
The Führer was impressed
with your report.

36:48.100 --> 36:52.100
He puts you in command of
the defence of Berlin.

36:53.300 --> 36:57.800
I'd have preferred it
if he executed me.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Let them get closer.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.900
Tank alert.

37:24.100 --> 37:28.700
Take it easy. Wait, kid.
They're still too far.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.200
Is it German artillery that I hear?
- I'm afraid not.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.900
But hasn't Steiner's
attack started?

38:28.600 --> 38:31.100
You have to go as fast as you can.
Time is running out.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.700
But the Führer has
the situation under control.

38:34.900 --> 38:36.400
Steiner will make
all the difference.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.500
He says it will change
military history.

38:41.100 --> 38:44.600
Everybody, but the Führer, knows
that's a fantasy.

38:45.300 --> 38:50.300
I even wonder if he believes it himself.
- Why would he be playing games?

38:51.000 --> 38:52.500
What does he have to lose?

38:54.200 --> 38:55.200
I don't believe a word of it.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.800
The enemy made a breakthrough.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.900
They took Zossen and are advancing
towards Stahnsdorf.

39:03.600 --> 39:07.100
They're at the northern city border,
between Frohnau and Pankow.

39:07.700 --> 39:12.700
In the east, they reached
Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.500
If Steiner attacks,
everything will be alright.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.700
Mein Führer...

39:23.400 --> 39:24.900
Steiner...

39:26.500 --> 39:29.000
Steiner didn't have enough force.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.100
The attack didn't take place.

39:48.600 --> 39:54.000
The following stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

40:08.900 --> 40:13.900
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

40:14.700 --> 40:18.700
How dare you
ignore my orders?

40:20.900 --> 40:23.400
Is this what it came to?

40:25.100 --> 40:30.100
The military, everybody lied
to me. Even the SS.

40:30.800 --> 40:35.800
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.600
I don't allow that...

40:39.200 --> 40:43.700
Cowards, traitors and incompetents.
- Führer, this is outrageous.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.900
The generals are the scum
of the German people.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.100
No sense of honour.

40:51.700 --> 40:55.700
You call yourself general because
you spent years at the academy...

40:56.900 --> 40:59.400
...where you only learnt
to use knife and fork.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
For years, the military
obstructed me.

41:04.700 --> 41:08.700
All you ever did is
thwart me.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.600
I should have had...

41:13.300 --> 41:17.800
...all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.200
I never went to the academy.

41:25.400 --> 41:31.800
But I conquered all
of Europe on my own.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.400
Traitors.

41:38.900 --> 41:43.500
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the start.

41:44.100 --> 41:48.700
Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

41:56.100 --> 41:58.100
They will drown
in their own blood.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.300
Calm, Gerda.

42:09.900 --> 42:13.400
All my orders have
been ignored.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.100
How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
It's over.

42:27.100 --> 42:30.100
The war is lost.

42:36.300 --> 42:39.800
But if you think this means
I'll leave Berlin...

42:40.400 --> 42:44.400
...you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.400
Do what you want.

43:12.300 --> 43:15.800
The Führer wasn't serious about
killing himself, was he?

43:16.500 --> 43:19.000
Frau Junge, Frau Christian.

43:22.800 --> 43:27.300
Get changed. In one hour,
a plane will take you south.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Everything is lost.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.500
Completely lost.

43:37.400 --> 43:40.800
You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.300
I'm staying too, mein Führer.

44:19.900 --> 44:20.900
Now what?

44:22.000 --> 44:23.500
Time to end this charade.

44:24.600 --> 44:28.600
Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.

44:29.300 --> 44:34.300
The Führer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.500
But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said: 'Do what you want'.

44:39.200 --> 44:42.200
Nobody can replace him.
He's the Führer.

44:42.900 --> 44:44.900
The Führer's confused.
He'll recover.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.500
Great.
And then what?

44:51.200 --> 44:54.200
No capitulation. That was
never his intention.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.900
We owe it to him.
- Hollow phrases.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
We have to act now.
Or it will be too late.

45:01.600 --> 45:04.100
You're only looking after yourself.
- Mind your words.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.900
Damn.

45:19.800 --> 45:23.800
We'll never get out of here alive.
It's all over.

45:24.400 --> 45:25.400
We've got to wait.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.400
Even the Führer doesn't believe in it
anymore. What will happen to us?

45:30.200 --> 45:34.200
Günsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.800
Why did you say
you wanted to stay with him?

45:38.500 --> 45:41.900
I don't know.
Honestly.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.200
It stopped.
Let's go for a walk.

46:29.100 --> 46:30.600
Traudl.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.700
Look here.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.700
I'm lighting another one.

47:15.700 --> 47:18.200
Let's go down again.

47:48.400 --> 47:52.400
Where do they come from?
- Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.500
They have to get
out of the field of fire.

47:59.300 --> 48:03.300
The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.

48:06.600 --> 48:10.100
I want them to go away from there.
This is insane.

48:11.300 --> 48:12.800
I'll take the responsibility.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.500
I think this is wrong.
- Great.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.700
Stop. Lights out.

48:31.300 --> 48:33.800
Stop. Stay where you are.

48:34.400 --> 48:37.400
Stay where you are.
- Alright, Germans.

48:41.600 --> 48:45.600
Help. They want to kill us.
- What is all this?

48:45.800 --> 48:49.800
A Greifkommando.
- You're kidding.

48:59.900 --> 49:02.900
Stop it.
Let those men go.

49:03.500 --> 49:06.500
What's this?
You have no authority here.

49:07.200 --> 49:11.700
These men are on the run.
Traitors will be killed.

49:12.400 --> 49:15.900
They're old men. Civilians.
You can't do this.

49:20.800 --> 49:23.300
Who's going to stop me?
You maybe?

49:25.500 --> 49:27.500
Stop it. That's enough.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.100
Dismissed.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.800
This man's a doctor.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.700
Can you operate?
- Not really.

51:41.900 --> 51:45.900
Don't let the children
take too many toys.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.600
And not too much nightwear.
That's no longer needed.

51:50.300 --> 51:53.300
Herr Minister...
- Frau Junge, my family will arrive soon.

51:53.900 --> 51:57.900
Can you look after them for a moment?
Thank you.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.100
Brigade führer, what can I do for you?

52:00.700 --> 52:03.700
Your Volkssturm is an easy prey
for the Russians.

52:04.300 --> 52:06.800
They have neither combat experience
nor good weapons.

52:07.500 --> 52:12.500
Their unconditional belief
in the final victory makes up for that.

52:12.700 --> 52:17.200
Herr Minister, without weapons
these men can't fight.

52:17.900 --> 52:19.400
Their deaths will be pointless.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.500
I don't pity them.

52:24.200 --> 52:26.700
I repeat:
I don't pity them.

52:27.300 --> 52:29.800
The people called this
upon themselves.

52:30.900 --> 52:34.400
This may come as a surprise to you.
Don't fool yourself.

52:35.100 --> 52:38.600
We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.

52:38.800 --> 52:42.300
And now they're paying for it.

52:59.400 --> 53:02.000
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.500
Don't be stupid.
This is about life and death.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.200
How can you say that?
Where are you?

53:08.400 --> 53:10.800
I decided
not to die in Berlin.

53:11.500 --> 53:15.900
Does my sister know where you are?
- Think about it. I'll call you back.

53:18.200 --> 53:20.800
Children, your room is to the right.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.400
Wait for me.

53:26.100 --> 53:29.500
Hello, Frau Goebbels.
- Good to see you, Frau Junge.

53:42.200 --> 53:44.200
Line up, children.

53:44.700 --> 53:46.700
Helga, come. Line up.

53:47.800 --> 53:52.400
Let's make ourselves look good and
then we go say hello to uncle Hitler.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.800
Do you remember the song?

54:38.500 --> 54:42.500
The best thing to do is to
shoot yourself in the mouth.

54:46.800 --> 54:49.800
You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead right away.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.500
I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.

54:54.100 --> 54:57.100
If I have to die,
at least without any pain.

54:57.800 --> 54:59.300
That's definitely painless.

54:59.800 --> 55:04.300
It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.

55:05.100 --> 55:06.600
A matter of seconds.

55:08.700 --> 55:11.700
Can I have one too?
- Me too.

55:17.000 --> 55:21.500
Himmler provided me well.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.600
Thank you.

55:42.700 --> 55:47.200
I would have liked to give you
a nicer present.

55:55.300 --> 55:59.300
Berlin, 23 April 1945.

56:03.100 --> 56:08.100
Dear sister. I'm sorry
to write you this.

56:08.900 --> 56:13.400
But this is how it is. It could
be over any moment.

56:14.100 --> 56:17.100
First of all: Hermann isn't with us.

56:17.700 --> 56:21.200
But I'm sure
you'll see him again.

56:21.900 --> 56:26.900
He'll get through this
and he'll fight from Bavaria.

56:27.600 --> 56:31.100
The Führer lost all hope
of a good outcome.

56:32.800 --> 56:36.300
Dear son. I don't know
if you'll receive this letter.

56:37.500 --> 56:42.000
Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.

56:42.800 --> 56:46.300
I stayed with daddy
against his will.

56:46.900 --> 56:49.900
Last Sunday, the Führer
wanted to help me escape.

56:50.600 --> 56:53.100
But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.

56:53.700 --> 56:57.200
I won't even think about it.
Our ideology's going down the drain...

56:57.900 --> 57:02.900
...and with it, everything that made life
beautiful and worthwhile.

57:03.600 --> 57:07.600
After the Führer and National Socialism,
there's nothing left to live for.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.300
That's why I brought
the children too.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
They're too good for the life
that awaits them.

57:14.600 --> 57:19.100
God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.

57:27.100 --> 57:31.100
I'll wear my bracelet with the green
stone until the very end.

57:31.800 --> 57:36.800
After that, I want
you to always wear it.

57:38.500 --> 57:42.000
Unfortunately, my diamond watch
is with the watchmaker.

57:42.700 --> 57:46.700
I included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.

57:47.900 --> 57:49.400
I want you to get it.

57:51.100 --> 57:54.600
You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.

57:55.200 --> 57:57.700
A birthday present
from the Führer.

57:59.400 --> 58:02.900
I owe some money
to the Heise company.

58:04.100 --> 58:08.700
There may be more debts, but
no more than 1500 Reichsmarks.

58:10.600 --> 58:16.600
All correspondence with
the Führer must be burnt.

58:18.900 --> 58:24.900
I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
The coffee is also for Lindner and Kathl.

58:25.600 --> 58:31.200
The cigarettes are for Mandi, the tobacco
for daddy, the chocolate for mummy.

58:32.100 --> 58:36.600
I can't think of anything else.
That's it for today.

58:37.800 --> 58:41.300
Dear sister, I wish
you lots of happiness.

58:41.800 --> 58:45.400
And remember,
you will see Hermann again.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.600
The warmest regards
and a kiss from...

58:50.200 --> 58:51.800
...your sister.

59:43.500 --> 59:45.500
Inge.

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:40.100
Listen, Keitel.
I want you to leave this evening.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.300
Go to Dönitz and help him
with the organisation.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Things have to be
started up again.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.700
I don't understand you.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.800
We have no more oil fields.
That's catastrophic.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:02.000
It makes any serious operation
impossible.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:08.700
When everything has been solved
here, we must get the oil fields back.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:16.700
Any questions?
- No, mein Führer.

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:19.800
Good.
Have a good trip.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.500
Min Fører, efter som du har besluttet
at blive i Berlin...

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.600
...do you agree that I take charge...

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.300
...with complete freedom of action?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
If I receive no reply
by 2200 hours...

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.500
...I'll assume you have
been incapacitated.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.600
I will then act on behalf
of the country and the motherland.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.300
That's high treason.
And betrayal of you.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.400
Göring's concerns are not
entirely unjustified.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:21.100
If our communication
system fails...

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:24.700
...we'll be cut off
from the outside world.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.400
We won't be able
to issue orders anymore.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.500
I think Göring wants to
seize the power.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.100
I never trusted his clique
on the Obersalzberg.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.800
This looks like a coup.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:40.800
The loser, the sponger.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.000
A parvenu, a lazy bastard.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.800
How dare he say
I'm incapacitated?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Hello.
- How did you get into Berlin?

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.200
It wasn't easy,
but I must speak to the Führer.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.300
If I were you,
I'd wait a bit.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.900
The Luftwaffe.
What did he turn that into?

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.600
For that alone,
he should be executed.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:13.700
This morphine addict
corrupted the country.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.500
And now this.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.100
He's betraying me.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.800
Me of all people.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:34.900
I want Göring stripped
of his power, right away.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.900
And, in case I don't
survive the war...

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.500
...he must be
executed immediately.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.200
What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Frau Junge, leave from
here before it's too late.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.600
The Führer wants to stay.
We can't leave him behind, can we?

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:05.300
He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. And least of all you.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.600
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
stay here. And the children.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.200
But the children...

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.900
I have always believed...

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.500
...that there was a way out.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400
Come in.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.600
Albert. Hello.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.200
You have a fever.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.800
Albert, I can't stand
it anymore.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.500
Why don't you leave with
the children, Magda?

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.600
Leave?
And go where?

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.800
I can arrange for you to be
taken to Schwanenwerder by barge.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:20.000
You can hide
until everything's over.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.600
It won't be long now anyway.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.200
I thought about it.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:31.900
My children cannot grow up
in a world without National Socialism.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.700
Think about it. The children
have a right to a future.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:48.600
If National Socialism dies,
there will be no future.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.700
I can't believe
you really want that.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.500
Go now.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.400
Come in.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.700
I knew you'd come.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.300
You wouldn't desert
the Führer.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.900
I've come to say goodbye to the Führer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.100
Of course, you must go.
Sit down.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I took some furniture
you designed.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:16.500
I couldn't leave it behind.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:21.100
Please, you must
not have eaten all day.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.800
That's true.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:33.600
It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.300
Did he ever doubt that?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.500
Lately, he often thought
you were against him too.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.600
I always said you'd come
and here you are.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:54.000
I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.600
I also think it's best.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:01.899
And, you know...

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
...it may sound strange...

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.200
...but I'm really happy here.
And I'm not afraid.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.700
You came.
- Mein Führer, I...

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.899
It's good.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.000
Let's sit down.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I had great plans
for the Germans and the world.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.800
Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.200
The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.000
Too late.

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:45.300
I can only be proud for openly
fighting the Jews...

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.100
...and for cleansing the Lebensraum
from the Jewish poison.

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:59.900
I don't find it hard to continue.
One brief moment...

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:10.100
...and then eternal peace.

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.900
But please spare the people,
mein Führer.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.400
If my people cannot endure
this ordeal...

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:26.500
...I won't shed a tear.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.200
They get what they deserve.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:35.300
They called this fate
upon themselves.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.800
For months...

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400
...I have to tell you this...

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.600
...for months I have sabotaged
your orders for destruction.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:12:00.300
I not only ignored your orders,
but even acted against them.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.300
I had to tell you.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.600
This never compromised
my personal loyalty to you.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.500
So you're leaving.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.400
Good.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.500
Goodbye.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.100
I wish you all the best.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.700
Eat well, gentlemen.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.100
Peter.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.800
It's alright, son.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.200
He has a fever.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.400
Yes, but he's alive.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.400
Loyalty and courage
still exist in this world.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Ritter von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch, how good...

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.200
...that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.400
Sit down.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.100
We came under heavy fire, but
still arrived in Gatow.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.300
From there,
we couldn't continue.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.400
We flew in a Fieseler Storch,
over the Russian lines...

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.100
...and landed on the
East-West axis, close to here.

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.200
Before landing, the Soviets
had a go at us.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.500
General Von Greim, I appoint you
supreme commander of the Luftwaffe.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.200
I hereby promote you
to General-Feldmarschall.

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.000
A big responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.600
You have to rebuild the
Luftwaffe from scratch.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.700
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.400
Life doesn't forgive weakness.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:26.100
This so-called humanity
is religious drivel.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:32.900
Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak...

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.200
...is a betrayal of nature.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:41.300
The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.600
Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.800
I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal...

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.400
...opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.700
Apes, for instance...

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:08.300
...kill all the odd ones.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.500
And what applies to apes,
must definitely apply to humans.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Himmler made an offer to surrender...

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.600
...to the allied powers.

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.800
Via Count Bernadotte.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.500
A message from the English radio.

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:45.300
Himmler.
Himmler of all people.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:53.500
The most loyal of my loyals.
That's the worst betrayal.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.600
Göring, he was corrupt.
Always has been.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:08.600
Speer, an absent-minded artist.
All the others: yes.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:14.900
But Himmler?
Has he gone insane?

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.600
He must have told
them I'm sick.

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.300
Maybe even dead.

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:33.200
Leave me alone with Ritter Von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch.

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:39.400
And get Fegelein.
- We don't know where he is.

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:43.600
What? He's Himmler's assistant.
He must be available.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:48.300
We haven't seen him for days.
- I want a report immediately.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.100
Please stay here, Doctor.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.400
You and Greim must go as quickly
as possible. Fly to Dönitz.

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:08.600
Tell him to do anything
it takes to punish Himmler.

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:13.300
We've decided to
die with you.

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.600
Thank you for this proof of loyalty.

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.800
But Himmler must die.
He committed treason.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.400
He's no longer privvy
to my plans.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.100
Mein Führer?

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:34.200
Do you think I'll sit and wait until
those Jewish swine slaughter me?

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:38.900
This is part of a huge decoy operation.
I've allowed the enemy...

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.100
...to invade the Reich and they
think they've won.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.300
But mark my words: they have
another thing coming.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.400
Dönitz is mobilising in the north.
Kesselring in the south.

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:57.100
We'll surround the enemy
and crush them.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:02.800
From Prague, three armies will attack
the Russians, simultaneously, from the back.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:08.600
I didn't know we still had
so many reserve troops.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.300
I made sure you'll soon have
a 1000 of the most modern...

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.500
...jets at your disposal.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.200
With those, you can make the
Luftwaffe ready for battle again.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.300
I kneel to your genius, at the
altar of the motherland.

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.000
Heil, mein Führer.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:50.100
You also request to leave Berlin?

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:55.800
Mein Führer, as you know,
all medical departments...

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.500
...that fall under the SS and Himmler,
have left Berlin.

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:04.700
Himmler is a traitor.
He won't escape punishment.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:10.100
Mein Führer, as Reichsarzt SS,
I have no more work here.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:14.800
Your request to leave Berlin
is unacceptable.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.500
My family...

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.200
If the Russians...
I must leave.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.300
You did nothing wrong.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:31.500
Future generations will thank you
for you medical research.

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.200
I take all the responsibility.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.000
We'll talk about it later.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:01.400
Gruppenführer Fegelein cannot
be found. He's not in the bunker.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.600
What, you can't find Fegelein?

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:09.800
Keep searching.
I need to talk to him. Immediately.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
If he left just like that,
that's desertion. Treason.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.200
Bring me Fegelein.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.300
Fegelein. Fegelein.

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:34.900
Daddy, why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:42.700
Ernst, is something wrong?
- No.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.900
Thank you.

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.000
Brigitte is hungry too.

01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:52.600
Ilse, you should
eat something as well.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.900
Thank you.
- There you go.

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.200
Thank you.

01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.800
What is it?
- Gruppenführer, you're under arrest.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.500
What?
- You're suspected of desertion.

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:06.100
Get dressed.
You'll come with us.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.900
Search the room.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.500
Let go of me.
You can't give me orders.

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:21.700
You can't have Hermann
executed, can you?

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.600
There's no doubt.
He wanted to flee.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.000
What does it matter?
Everything's over.

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.700
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant by Hermann.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.300
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.600
There's no mercy for traitors.
No compassion for them.

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.900
He'll be court-martialled
and executed.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
What's the point of that?

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.700
It is my wish.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.600
You're the Führer.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.500
Speak.

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.600
The Russians are advancing
more and more.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.200
There are no more reserves.
Supplies from the air are impossible.

01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:26.400
There is no ammunition coming
in anymore.

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:33.200
In the north, the Russians are standing
in front of the Weidendammer bridge.

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.800
In the east: Lustgarten.
South: Potsdammer Platz.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.900
West: Tiergarten, about 400 metres
away from the chancellery.

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:45.100
How long can you hold out?
- At most, two days.

01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:48.800
Including the government area?
- Yes.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000
As a soldier, I suggest we
flee Berlin. It's surrounded.

01:25:55.700 --> 01:26:01.700
The battle of Berlin killed about
20,000 of our best officers.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.400
That's what young people are for.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.600
What you suggest is insane.
Ridiculous.

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:13.300
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.900
Mein Führer, the orders have been written.
I give you my word...

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.100
The Führer cannot make a honourless
disappearance from world history.

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:27.800
Even if an advance is successful...

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.500
...I'll end up in another
troublesome situation.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.200
I'd have to stay in the open air
or on a farm...

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:39.400
...and wait for the end.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.500
Wenck is advancing with the 12th army.
He can join the 9th...

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:51.100
...and give the Russians
the final blow.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Wenck's an excellent fellow.
Send a telegram to Keitel:

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:04.800
Immediately report to me the following:
1. Where are Wenck's vanguard located?

01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:08.600
2. When will they attack again?

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:15.200
3. Where is the 9th army?
4. Where will the 9th make a breakthrough?

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:22.000
You'll see, gentlemen.
I'll be right.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.300
Wenck will come.

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.800
Wenck will come.

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.200
I want to know if Wenck
can do anything at all.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:56.300
It's unlikely that Wenck's
small amount of troops...

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:01.600
What's unlikely about the offensive?
- Wenck can't do anything anymore.

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:06.300
Then why don't you tell the Führer that?
Has everybody gone mad?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Do you think the Führer doesn't know?
He'll never surrender.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.100
And neither will we. I've been
through that once. Never again.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.800
Come along. I have to go.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.500
Stop right there.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.100
Heil Hitler.

01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:33.400
Excuse me. I fell asleep.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Did you get some rest, my child?

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:41.700
In shorthand.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.500
My political will.

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:57.700
More than 30 years have passed...

01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:02.400
...since I made my contribution
as a volunteer...

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.600
...during the first World War.

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:12.300
During those 30 years,
I learnt to think, act and live...

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
...out of love and loyalty
for my people.

01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:23.600
Excuse me. The shooting.
- Please sit down.

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.900
Centuries will pass...

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:34.700
...but from the ruins
of our cities and monuments...

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:40.200
...the hatred
of the people...

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:43.500
...who did this to us,
will continue to flare up.

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:48.200
International Judaism and
its allies.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.500
What is it, Herr Minister?

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:07.800
Imagine this.
The Führer wants me to leave Berlin.

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:10.900
He ordered it.

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:16.600
I've never ignored an order
from the Führer.

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:30.900
But I will ignore this order.
I'll stay with the Führer.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:36.900
Please, Frau Junge...

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:42.100
...I want to dictate my will to you.

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:47.300
I'm typing
the Führer's will.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.400
Good.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.100
I understand.
Some other time.

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:06.400
Mein Führer, according to the racial law
I'm obliged to ask you:

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:09.600
Mein Führer, are you
of Aryan descent?

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:17.100
Can I see your identity card?

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.400
You're talking to the Führer here.
- Alright then.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.500
And you, Fräulein Braun,
are you of Aryan descent?

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.500
Then there's nothing
to stop us.

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:33.600
I'm asking you now:
Do you, mein Führer, Adolf Hitler...

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:39.300
...take Eva Braun, present here,
as your wife? Answer 'yes'.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:45.100
Do you, Eva Braun, take Führer
Adolf Hitler, present here...

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.800
...as your husband?
Answer 'yes'.

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:53.500
Then I declare you
man and wife.

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.900
Two men here.

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:38.800
Everything will be alright.

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.300
You must go to the Führer right away.
- Now?

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.200
How long can we hold out?
- Twenty hours, no more.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:14.400
The Russians are close. At the moment,
we forced them to stop.

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.200
You know, Mohnke. The western
democracies are decadent.

01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:25.900
They'll succumb to
the people from the east.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.700
All the best. Thank you.

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.900
It wasn't just for Germany.

01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:57.900
A message from Keitel.

01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:04.300
1. Wenck's vanguard are
stuck south of Schwielowsee.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.500
2. The 12th army can't continue
the attack on Berlin.

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:13.200
3. The 9th army is
completely surrounded.

01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:38.300
What do we do when the last
ammunition reserves have been exhausted?

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.500
I'll never surrender. Never.

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:49.700
I forbid you, and the other
commanders, to surrender.

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:07.400
Listen, Günsche. My wife and I
are going to commit suicide.

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:12.200
I don't want my corpse
exposed by the Russians.

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.900
I don't want them to get me,
dead or alive.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:20.000
I want to be burnt
and never to be found.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.300
Günsche, I want you to promise me...

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000
...that you will do
all that it takes.

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.700
Mein Führer...

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.800
...this is a terrible order,
but I will execute it.

01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:10.300
Kempka.
- Erich, I need 200 litres of petrol.

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.900
Are you mad?
Where should I find them?

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.600
From the parked vehicles.

01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:20.200
What's all that petrol for?
- I can't say.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Come, please.
The Führer wants to see us.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.100
Should I tell the Führer
you're indisposed?

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.300
It's only my collapsed lung.

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.400
I'll die soon anyway.

01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:48.100
Excuse me.

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.800
Over here, Herr Professor.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:14.300
One moment, please.

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.100
Excuse me.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:02.600
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important work.

01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:07.300
Mein Führer, keep faith
in the final victory.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.500
Lead us
and we shall follow.

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.100
Come along.

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:27.300
Join the gang.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.200
Come. Have a drink.

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:36.700
Besides drinking, there's little we can do.
- Do sit down.

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:43.900
That's better.
Yes, the situation is pretty shitty.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.000
Can we sit down?
- Please do, Fräulein...

01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:56.500
Frau...
- That's Frau Hitler.

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.800
It's alright.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.600
A pity we can't go
outside anymore.

01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:09.100
Only if you want
to die a heroic death.

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:15.200
Fritz, control yourself a bit.
- Yes. Control.

01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.100
Take cover.

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:43.100
What are you doing here?
- I have to report to the Führer.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.800
You can't right now.
Sit down.

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.300
Sit. Drink.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.600
Let me introduce Frau Hitler.

01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:58.700
So young and so many decorations.
You must be proud.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.600
Excuse me.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:08.100
You can use our toilet.

01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:21.100
If your hand shakes, the bullet
might only hit an optic nerve.

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:26.300
That's why it's good
to also take the poison.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.500
When you bite through the capsule,
pull the trigger.

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.200
Will I have enough time?

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:37.800
The poison starts working
after one or two seconds.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.900
Tornow, you too.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.500
Come Blondi.

01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:42.800
You know, Frau Junge,
I've known...

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.500
my husband for
more than 15 years.

01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:51.600
But when I think about it,
I know nothing about him.

01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:54.300
Even though he likes to talk.

01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:02.000
I longed for Berlin,
but he's so different now.

01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:06.200
He only talks about dogs
and vegetarian food now.

01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:09.400
I hate Blondi.

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:16.100
I sometimes kick her and Adolf
then wonders why she acts strange.

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.700
I think he doesn't want anybody
to really know him.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.500
...he can be so caring
in his private life.

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:43.700
And then he uses
that rude language again.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
When he's the Führer, you mean?

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:51.600
Come, let's smoke another one.

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.000
I'm sorry.

01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:21.200
You have so many worries
and here I am, whining.

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.900
Frau Junge, I'm giving you this coat
as a goodbye present.

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:31.600
I like fashionable ladies.
I want you to enjoy it.

01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.300
What a surprise. Thank you.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.500
I just don't know where and when
I can wear it.

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.200
Please, try to get out of here.

01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:48.400
Promise me.

01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:22.500
Thank you. That was very good,
Fräulein Manziarly.

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:47.700
The time has come. It's finished.

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.600
The Führer wants to say goodbye.
Come with me.

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:03.700
You're the bravest mother
of the Reich.

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.400
Führer, you made me the happiest
woman in Germany.

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.600
Salute my beautiful Bavaria.

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.400
Children, what are you doing here?

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.500
We want to see aunt Eva
and uncle Hitler.

01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:07.600
Have you eaten anything yet?
- Only breakfast.

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.900
Stay here, I'll get something to eat.
I'll be right back.

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:26.700
Comrades, this is the
latest news from the outside.

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:32.400
Berlin is full of warehouses: There were
houses here, there were houses there.

01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:40.100
Herr Günsche,
I want to speak to the Führer.

01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:43.800
Please, I have to.

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.900
Frau Goebbels, the Führer
doesn't want to be disturbed.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Please, Günsche,
just for a moment.

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:52.100
Please.

01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:02.200
Mein Führer, Frau Goebbels is here.

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.200
What is it?

01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:14.300
Mein Führer, I beg you:
Leave Berlin.

01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:21.100
Don't leave us Führer.
What will become of us?

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:32.200
Tomorrow, I'll be cursed by millions,
but that's how it is.

01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:37.300
Get up. Come.

01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:41.900
Come.

01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:52.900
Aunt Traudl, I like it
when it thunders.

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:57.000
Why?
- Nothing can happen to us here.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.600
Can it?
- No.

01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:10.800
Gotcha.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:37.300
Reichsleiter, it's over.

01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.800
The Führer is dead.

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.600
There's daddy.

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:31.700
Are you crazy?
For that damned petrol of yours...

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:34.400
Erich, shut up.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.400
Stand back.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.400
Come on, continue.

01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:03.500
Continue.

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:36.100
No, don't.

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.500
Let grandpa go.

01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:49.400
Order. Order.
We must have order.

01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:53.100
Order has to return.

01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:11.500
This way. We know the way.
You can trust us.

01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:14.200
Hurry.

01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:23.400
I was on the side of
the Red Beasts.

01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:29.400
I supported the Bolsheviks.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.500
Let's hope the Russians
got our message.

01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:41.600
We'll soon find out.
- Or not.

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:49.900
What news do you have, General?

01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:55.600
Adolf Hitler and his wife
committed suicide in the bunker.

01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:02.900
The new government
authorised me...

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:08.200
...to start peace talks...

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:14.800
...between our countries, that both
suffered severe losses.

01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:20.600
General, if you were me,
would you make peace with you?

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:25.400
My government will never accept
unconditional surrender.

01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:32.100
Given the situation,
you have no other choice.

01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.900
Surrender? Never.
That's shameful.

01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:41.100
Years ago, I conquered
Berlin on the Reds...

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:45.700
...and I'll defend the city
to my dying day.

01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:49.400
In the short time I have
as Chancellor...

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000
...I'll never sign
a surrender treaty.

01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:57.700
It's for the sake of the people.
- The Führer's orders are final.

01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:01.900
This is crazy.
We have to start negotiations.

01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:05.500
I repeat, gentlemen:
I do not surrender.

01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:09.200
Send a message to Marshal Zhukov.
- Zhukov?

01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:12.300
What's happening?
- We're surrendering.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Then I must kill you.
The Führer forbids any surrender.

01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:39.200
How long does it work?
- Around four hours.

01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:21.600
Children, the doctor has the medication
I told you about.

01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:24.800
It's a bit bitter,
but it will work.

01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:28.000
A sip for everybody.

01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:31.500
Who wants to go first?

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:37.700
Heide, you're always so brave?

01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:45.100
Have another sip.

01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:50.300
See? That wasn't so bad.

01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:57.600
Well done.
Helmut.

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:05.300
This medication makes sure you don't
get ill in this humid bunker.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.500
But it's not humid
in the bunker.

02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:14.800
Well done.

02:00:24.100 --> 02:00:25.600
Helga.

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:29.400
I don't want to.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.400
What's that? Do you want to get sick?
- Please, mama. I don't want to drink it.

02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:42.200
Don't cry, baby.
That doesn't help.

02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:44.900
You have to drink the medicine.

02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:50.100
Helga.

02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:58.400
Come on, open your mouth.

02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:21.400
Goodnight, children.

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:35.100
One day the lie will fall apart...

02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:38.400
...and there will be light
in the darkness.

02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:41.000
Please read that.

02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:46.600
One day the lie will fall apart
and there will be light in the darkness.

02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:51.400
Let's do it differently.
One day the lie will collapse...

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.500
...and truth will triumph
once again.

02:01:57.300 --> 02:02:00.800
At that moment, we will
stand above everybody...

02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:03.400
...pure and...

02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:08.600
immaculate.

02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:18.600
We don't stand a chance.
- So what? I want to get away.

02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:20.800
How do we get
through the lines?

02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:23.900
Doesn't matter.
I'm not staying another minute.

02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:27.500
We'll die.
- It won't be that bad, surely.

02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:31.200
If we stay, the Russians
will get us for sure.

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:34.400
All the best.

02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:36.900
Come, let's go.

02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:12.300
On 30 April 1945, the Führer
committed suicide...

02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:18.100
...and in doing so, he deserted
everybody who was loyal to him.

02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:23.800
You, German soldiers, were loyal to
the Führer and were prepared...

02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:30.600
...to continue the battle for Berlin,
although ammunition was in short supply...

02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:35.900
...and further resistance
was pointless.

02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:40.100
I hereby declare an
immediate cease-fire.

02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:44.300
Each hour you continue fighting...

02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:51.500
...prolongs the suffering of the people
of Berlin and of our wounded.

02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:55.800
In agreement with the supreme
command of the Soviet troops...

02:08:56.300 --> 02:09:01.900
...I order you to stop
fighting immediately.

02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:09.600
Weidling, former commander
of the Berlin defence area.

02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:13.600
A glass of water, please.

02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:21.700
I don't need you anymore.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.600
The game's over.

02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:37.800
It's time.
- Don't you see what's going on here?

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:41.500
I insist that you help us,
as a doctor.

02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:44.800
Alright, then.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.500
Go. You did a lot.
Thank you.

02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:09.400
Schädle, hurry. Come on.
- I'm not going anywhere anymore.

02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:13.800
Come along.

02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.900
Are you alright?
- Keep going.

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:35.300
Sturmmann Krüger and his group
defended the Wolf Bridge...

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.500
...and he receives the Iron Cross.

02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:43.100
Sturmmann Wagner took out two
machine-gun nests...

02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:46.800
...and therefore, receives
the Iron Cross.

02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:51.000
Sturmmann Rauch has gotten
messages through the lines...

02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:54.100
...and receives the Iron Cross.

02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:27.400
The others are coming.

02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:36.200
Take cover, Müller.

02:14:55.900 --> 02:14:56.900
Who's that?

02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:06.600
A German.

02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:13.700
Herr Hewel?

02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:19.600
Thank God, you're alive.

02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:23.100
Where are the others?

02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:29.900
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere. Maybe.

02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:33.500
Most people from my group
must be dead.

02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:36.600
I should never
have left that bunker.

02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:41.800
I should have shot myself,
but I couldn't.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Eat something first.
There's always enough time to die.

02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:47.100
You stay with the women.

02:16:48.299 --> 02:16:49.900
Come along.

02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:06.000
The Russians have surrounded us.
- What's going to happen to us?

02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:09.100
Maybe you can get through.
You could try.

02:17:09.799 --> 02:17:11.299
I'm not taking another step.

02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:16.900
Think about it. The Russians
are after us.

02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:22.600
As a woman, you might have a chance.
Try it.

02:17:23.799 --> 02:17:25.299
Good luck.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000
When you walk past the Russians,
don't look them in the eyes.

02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:36.200
Remember that well. All the best.

02:17:45.299 --> 02:17:46.799
The Russians.

02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:02.000
Gerda, let's go.
- You go.

02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:05.600
I'm exhausted.
- Please.

02:18:07.799 --> 02:18:11.799
I have to give it a try.
Don't be angry with me.

02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:17.700
I'll be alright.

02:18:30.900 --> 02:18:32.400
Herr Doktor.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.500
My comrades want to surrender.
Can I join you?

02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:41.700
The Führer's dead. Do you want
to continue the war on your own?

02:18:42.299 --> 02:18:43.799
I'm obliged by my oath.

02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:48.900
Then you'd better go
to the Brigadeführer.

02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:19.200
The Russians are evacuating the square.
- So?

02:19:20.299 --> 02:19:22.299
No opposition.
No shooting.

02:19:22.900 --> 02:19:25.400
Then they'll be
here within the hour.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
What shall we do?

02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:32.600
We can't surrender.
- What exactly do you mean?

02:19:33.299 --> 02:19:36.799
When the Russians come,
we'll empty our weapons on them.

02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:41.799
The last bullets are for ourselves.
- That's radical.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:46.200
Is this prestigious murder and suicide
our only option?

02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:50.400
We're SS officers.
We can't survive the Führer.

02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:53.500
Who agrees with me?

02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:44.300
Come and sit down with me?
- Please.

02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:55.200
Why do you want to continue living?
- And you? Why do you want to die?

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
See this?

02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:02.600
The Führer gave it
to me personally.

02:22:03.300 --> 02:22:06.800
As a last decoration?
- Maybe.

02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:12.000
A goodbye present from Hitler.
I had to promise him something.

02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:17.100
If the Russians get me,
I have to kill myself.

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:23.400
Did he make you promise that?
But why?

02:22:24.100 --> 02:22:27.100
Maybe he didn't want
me to be forced...

02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:29.800
...to say anything bad
about him.

02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:34.400
But, as a diplomat,
you're under international protection.

02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:38.600
Who will benefit
if you stick to your deal?

02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:40.800
There they are.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.500
Don't shoot, comrades.

02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:03.900
We surrendered.
The war is over.

02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:07.100
It's over.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000

in German concentration camps.

02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:07.300

and avoid imprisonment.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.400
Hanna Reitsch survived the war
and would break many flying records.

02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:01.700
She died on 28 August 1979.

02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:07.400

suicide on 24 May 1945.

He was sentenced to
20 years, in Nuremberg.

02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:44.400

near the Lehrter Bahnhof.

02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:11.400
Rochus Misch was released
by the Soviets in 1955.

02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:14.200
He still lives in Berlin.

02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:17.300
Traudl Junge was classified
as a 'young follower'.

02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:20.900
She worked as a secretary and lived
in Munich, until her death in 2002.

02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:27.300
All the horror I heard about during
the Nuremberg trial...

02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:33.300
...the 6 million Jews, dissidents
or people of another race...

02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:39.500
...who died, shocked me deeply.

02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:45.400
But I hadn't made the connection
with my own past yet.

02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:51.100
I reassured myself by thinking
I wasn't personally guilty of it.

02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:56.900
And that I hadn't known
about the sheer size of it.

02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:03.500
But one day, I walked
past a commemorative plaque...

02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:07.800
...for Sophie Scholl,
here in the Franz-Joseph-Strasse.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.600
I saw that she was my age...

02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:17.700
...and that she was executed in
the year I joined Hitler.

02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:23.400
And only then did I realise...

02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:27.200
that youth is no excuse.

02:28:27.700 --> 02:28:33.700
And that it might have been
possible to find out the truth.

02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:13.100
DOWNFALL

02:31:14.305 --> 02:31:20.246
