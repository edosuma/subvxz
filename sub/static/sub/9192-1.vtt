SUBTITLES BY <i><b>LUIS-SUBS</b></i>

00:53.793 --> 00:57.197
This is Cody's special day,
November 11th.

00:58.299 --> 01:00.032
Jump.

01:00.234 --> 01:03.035
Dad! Dad!

01:03.237 --> 01:04.970
Well, there he is.

01:04.971 --> 01:07.105
Wait, is it your birthday today?

01:07.107 --> 01:09.842
You got to make it!
You got to make it!

01:11.312 --> 01:14.546
I told you.
I told you I would get it.

01:14.548 --> 01:15.981
Happy Birthday.

01:17.518 --> 01:21.987
Next birthday we'll have
a whole team of guys here.

01:21.989 --> 01:25.123
We'll all be playing
baseball together.

01:25.125 --> 01:27.426
Get set.

01:27.428 --> 01:28.927
Go!

01:30.897 --> 01:32.364
Argh!

01:33.600 --> 01:36.869
I pulled a muscle.
Got to do...

01:38.872 --> 01:41.073
What...
What the hell was that?

01:41.075 --> 01:42.908
- Cody?
- Cody?

01:42.910 --> 01:45.611
Cody? Cody!

01:45.613 --> 01:47.880
No!

02:06.966 --> 02:08.433
Nah, I don't think Hoyt
had anything to do with it.

02:08.435 --> 02:13.372
Uh, sad but true,
kids are kidnapped.

02:13.374 --> 02:16.541
Well, right after it happened,
'cause, you know,

02:16.543 --> 02:19.077
they had to, like, drag him
into court and all that stuff...

02:19.079 --> 02:21.413
so he's kind of forced to be around
everybody and all that stuff...

02:21.415 --> 02:25.050
there was a difference. And there was
some mean in him then, you know.

02:25.052 --> 02:28.921
I didn't consider him, up until
that time, a drunkard or anything.

02:28.923 --> 02:31.356
I didn't talk to him at length
about it, but, you know,

02:31.358 --> 02:34.593
we were delivering hay,
and he was just broke up.

02:34.595 --> 02:38.096
You know, show it to me
and then I'll believe it.

02:38.098 --> 02:41.333
You ask me, I think he's...
he's guilty.

02:41.335 --> 02:44.269
Maybe everybody's projecting
their fear on Hoyt.

02:44.271 --> 02:45.637
Maybe that's what's going on.

02:45.639 --> 02:47.639
That's why he's left alone.

02:47.641 --> 02:50.442
But he's staying there
until he finds his boy.

02:55.315 --> 02:57.349
I mean, it's sad.
It's sad as can be.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.318
I've got kids and grandkids.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.353
And if an 8-year-old grandkid
of mine disappeared, I'd be...

03:01.355 --> 03:03.989
Yeah, I don't know what I'd do.

03:03.991 --> 03:06.291
Cody was in my little girl's class.

03:06.293 --> 03:09.461
I've been having to go in and sleep
with her almost every night,

03:09.463 --> 03:12.197
you know, 'til she falls asleep.

03:12.199 --> 03:15.634
So, yeah, it's been hard.

03:15.636 --> 03:17.402
Of course, I know Cody, man.

03:17.404 --> 03:20.339
He's a good kid.
Funny.

03:20.341 --> 03:24.576
Little wiry. He was gonna grow
into them feet one day.

03:24.578 --> 03:26.511
Yeah, man.

03:28.281 --> 03:31.216
Yeah. I knew Cody.

03:36.255 --> 03:39.024
I mean,
I've followed it quite a bit.

03:39.026 --> 03:42.527
I don't really buy either one.
I'm not into the paranormal stuff.

03:42.529 --> 03:46.365
I've never seen that tape.
And I've never seen a wolf like that.

03:46.367 --> 03:48.233
Um...

03:48.235 --> 03:51.203
But it could happen.

03:51.205 --> 03:53.672
Could happen around here if
it's going to happen somewhere.

03:53.674 --> 03:57.776
That's... I don't believe
any of it, you know.

03:57.778 --> 03:59.544
I got to see something
to believe it.

03:59.546 --> 04:01.346
I've never seen anything like that.

04:03.116 --> 04:07.052
You stick around, man,
you'll see something.

04:24.170 --> 04:25.637
My name is Sam green.

04:25.639 --> 04:27.539
I'm a PH.D.
In socio-cultural anthropology

04:27.541 --> 04:30.342
from the university of Chicago.
I've been working for MDE

04:30.344 --> 04:32.344
for about six months as
a field scientist.

04:32.346 --> 04:34.112
Sorry.

04:39.719 --> 04:41.686
My man!

04:41.688 --> 04:43.388
Hey, Sam!

04:43.390 --> 04:44.589
How are you, buddy?

04:44.591 --> 04:45.657
- Good to see you, man.
- You, too.

04:45.659 --> 04:48.193
My name's Cameron Murphy. Um...

04:48.195 --> 04:50.328
I'm an investigative journalist
from Los Angeles.

04:50.330 --> 04:53.799
Sam and I grew up together.
He called me about a month ago.

04:53.801 --> 04:58.170
Told me he was heading up an investigation
to some strange cattle ranch.

04:58.172 --> 05:02.140
Asked me if I would come out and observe
it from a third party perspective.

05:02.142 --> 05:03.442
Hey, this is our
videographer Britain.

05:03.444 --> 05:05.210
Hey, man. Cameron.
Nice to meet you.

05:05.212 --> 05:08.280
My name's Britain Sloan.
I'm a freelance cameraman.

05:08.282 --> 05:10.715
Normally don't like to be
in front of the camera.

05:10.717 --> 05:12.617
So I'll make this short.

05:12.619 --> 05:16.354
I've done this kind of work
before with other groups.

05:16.356 --> 05:20.125
And we've never come across anything
strange or out of the ordinary.

05:20.127 --> 05:23.195
So I hope this trip
is a little different.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.362
Hey, man, would you grab
his bag for him?

05:24.364 --> 05:26.231
Yeah.

05:26.233 --> 05:28.133
- Thanks, man.
- How about a little tour of the grounds?

05:28.135 --> 05:29.468
- Yeah.
- All right.

05:30.603 --> 05:32.437
Hoyt!

05:32.439 --> 05:34.506
I want you to meet
my friend Cameron Murphy.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.241
- Hey, Cameron.
- Hoyt, pleasure.

05:36.243 --> 05:39.411
Hoyt Miller. That's my name.
Hoyt Miller.

05:39.413 --> 05:42.814
And, uh, I bought this, uh...

05:42.816 --> 05:47.486
This ranch, oh, four years...
little over four years ago...

05:47.488 --> 05:52.357
with the idea of turning it
into something, you know,

05:52.359 --> 05:57.496
special or... say, uh...

05:58.865 --> 06:01.633
Do I have to do this?

06:01.635 --> 06:05.470
Can I... do I have to talk
to the camera right now?

06:05.472 --> 06:07.606
I don't really feel like it.

06:07.608 --> 06:08.257
Nice to meet you.

06:08.283 --> 06:10.242
All right, you guys be
up in about 45 minutes.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.476
We'll have the ATV ready.

06:11.478 --> 06:13.178
- Sounds good.
- Come on, girl.

06:21.521 --> 06:23.522
This is our main vet tech Lisa.

06:23.524 --> 06:24.789
Lisa, Cameron.

06:24.791 --> 06:26.625
Oh, Cameron,
I heard a lot about you.

06:26.627 --> 06:30.495
My name is Lisa Moreau.
I'm the field veterinary tech.

06:30.497 --> 06:32.831
I've worked locally for years.

06:32.833 --> 06:35.934
I just started working with
MDE a couple months ago.

06:35.936 --> 06:38.436
This is my first big
case with them.

06:38.438 --> 06:42.207
They brought me on because I'm so familiar
with the cattle mutilations in the area.

06:42.209 --> 06:44.209
It's disturbing.

06:44.211 --> 06:47.379
I've seen a lot of sick and dead
animals in my line of work.

06:47.381 --> 06:51.449
But... The cattle mutilation
phenomenon is...

06:52.885 --> 06:56.254
I don't have an explanation for it.

06:57.356 --> 06:58.823
Is the horse still acting unusual?

06:58.825 --> 07:01.760
Uh, no. The horse's moods
have stabilized.

07:01.762 --> 07:03.895
Their behavior's been
completely erratic.

07:03.897 --> 07:07.432
So, it's fine now.
But talk to me in 10 minutes.

07:07.434 --> 07:09.334
- All right, I will.
- OK.

07:09.336 --> 07:11.469
Uh, you seen Matt?

07:11.471 --> 07:13.872
Yeah, I think Ray has him setting
up something behind the house.

07:13.874 --> 07:16.308
- Lisa, pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

07:18.311 --> 07:21.246
That's a long time
to be in Afghanistan, man.

07:21.248 --> 07:24.816
Actually, I was embedded with
a group of about 10 soldiers

07:24.818 --> 07:27.319
for a period of
nearly three months.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.854
- How's it going?
- You mean, motion sensor hell?

07:29.856 --> 07:31.856
Hi, I'm Matt Johnson.

07:31.858 --> 07:35.427
And I work in the media lab at MDE,
which is how I met Sam,

07:35.429 --> 07:37.329
who brought me onboard the project.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.864
We both share a passion
for the paranormal.

07:39.866 --> 07:43.268
And, uh, well,
I really hope that this project

07:43.270 --> 07:45.437
helps legitimize the
field a little bit.

07:45.439 --> 07:50.709
Also I'm here as the team's
driver, cook, and resident bitch.

07:51.311 --> 07:52.344
You ready?

07:53.413 --> 07:54.479
Copy.

07:56.917 --> 07:57.983
What was that?

07:57.985 --> 07:59.918
My hand, over.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.321
Walk in front of it,
you stupid ass.

08:04.557 --> 08:06.524
That's Ray.
Let's go meet him.

08:12.298 --> 08:15.333
Ray, I want you
to meet Cameron Murphy.

08:15.335 --> 08:16.601
Hey, man.

08:16.603 --> 08:19.004
You here to help
with the sensors, man?

08:19.006 --> 08:21.873
Ray Reed.
Ex-military.

08:21.875 --> 08:25.343
Here for the security
and wires and shit.

08:25.345 --> 08:29.748
If lady luck shines upon us, this place
is gonna be a God damn fortress.

08:30.783 --> 08:33.585
That's all I got.
We done?

08:33.587 --> 08:35.587
Hmm.

08:37.890 --> 08:39.624
How are the cameras coming?

08:39.626 --> 08:41.926
They're almost set up.
When you guys are done,

08:41.928 --> 08:43.761
why don't you pop on by
and I'll show you.

08:43.764 --> 08:45.330
Afternoon, Hoyt.

08:45.332 --> 08:46.831
Ready to roll?

08:46.833 --> 08:49.401
Let's go.

08:52.005 --> 08:54.839
All right.
Everybody in?

08:59.712 --> 09:01.513
Where we headed?

09:01.515 --> 09:03.515
Hoyt found a dead deer
on the property.

09:03.517 --> 09:04.983
Sam wants to check it out.

09:08.921 --> 09:10.922
What's the acreage?

09:10.924 --> 09:13.425
About 1,000 give or take.

09:19.765 --> 09:21.666
Well, it's not clearly defined.

09:21.668 --> 09:25.103
But parts of Southern Idaho,
the Uintah basin, four corners,

09:25.105 --> 09:26.738
all the way to Nevada
and California is considered

09:26.740 --> 09:28.707
the paranormal Mecca
of the United States.

09:28.709 --> 09:31.643
Local tribes won't even set foot
on this land to this day.

09:31.645 --> 09:33.111
There's evidence for this?

09:33.113 --> 09:36.081
We got, uh, evidence going
back to the 1800s

09:36.083 --> 09:38.483
with the first documented
UFO sightings.

09:38.485 --> 09:40.919
Roswell crash in '47.

09:40.921 --> 09:43.655
First reported cattle
mutilation in '67.

09:43.657 --> 09:46.091
Dugway is basically
the new area 51.

09:46.093 --> 09:47.625
Never heard of it.

09:47.627 --> 09:48.993
You passed it right
on the way up here.

09:48.995 --> 09:51.463
Ground zero for U.S.
military research.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.933
I mean, we're talking everything from
remote viewing to psychological warfare.

09:54.935 --> 09:57.836
Just over the ridge here.

10:29.135 --> 10:33.538
Sam, I'm sorry to burst your bubble.
But she died of natural causes.

10:33.540 --> 10:35.473
Do you see the discoloration
in the tongue?

10:35.475 --> 10:38.076
It's a classic case
of hemorrhagic disease.

10:38.078 --> 10:39.778
Take a sample anyway.

10:39.780 --> 10:41.713
Sure, whatever you want.

10:41.715 --> 10:44.783
Hey, uh...
We'd better get back.

10:44.785 --> 10:46.584
We got a big storm coming.

10:52.691 --> 10:53.725
Thanks, Hoyt.

10:53.727 --> 10:55.126
All right.

10:58.497 --> 11:00.999
All the feeds record directly
into the server here.

11:01.001 --> 11:03.968
Just in case, I got it
all backed up on the C-70.

11:03.970 --> 11:05.970
It's generator powered.

11:05.972 --> 11:08.473
It's all independently wired,
and it's set to record 24/7.

11:08.475 --> 11:11.476
Camera one's a wide
shot of the road

11:11.478 --> 11:14.446
so we can monitor everyone coming
in and out of the property.

11:14.448 --> 11:18.149
Camera two is wide of the house.

11:18.151 --> 11:21.820
Camera three is of
the Western pasture.

11:21.822 --> 11:24.489
Camera four is of the corral.

11:24.491 --> 11:26.858
Camera five is the barn exterior.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.461
And camera six is inside the barn.

11:29.463 --> 11:30.863
That's it for the exterior cameras.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.597
What happens at night?

11:32.599 --> 11:34.032
They all switch to infrared.

11:34.034 --> 11:37.969
This is the X-ray
I was talking about.

11:37.971 --> 11:39.571
Not really my thing.

11:39.573 --> 11:40.772
Oh, let me see it.

11:40.774 --> 11:42.607
Well, just pass it along.

11:42.609 --> 11:44.509
Thanks.

11:44.511 --> 11:47.178
If I could,
I'd like to propose a toast.

11:47.180 --> 11:50.882
Uh, I just want to, um...

11:50.884 --> 11:53.518
Thank you all for coming up here.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.019
Uh...

11:55.021 --> 11:56.788
Since my boy's been gone,

11:56.790 --> 12:00.024
the help's been
few and far between.

12:00.026 --> 12:04.596
And I just...
I really appreciate it.

12:04.598 --> 12:07.065
And I want you to know that

12:07.067 --> 12:10.502
whatever this thing is,
I believe it's still here.

12:10.504 --> 12:13.238
And it's really smart.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.006
As a matter of fact,

12:15.008 --> 12:18.743
I would bet my arm that
it's watching us right now.

12:18.745 --> 12:20.812
So...

12:23.015 --> 12:25.250
Oh, no.
Don't leave me up here.

12:26.886 --> 12:28.019
Cheers.

12:28.021 --> 12:29.787
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

12:29.789 --> 12:33.258
Where do you want me to go?

12:33.260 --> 12:34.726
Just walk and I'll find you.

12:34.728 --> 12:35.994
Copy.

12:37.596 --> 12:38.997
This is the living room?

12:38.999 --> 12:40.598
Yes.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.600
Say hi to big brother.

12:45.070 --> 12:46.237
Say it.

12:46.239 --> 12:47.739
Hi.

12:47.741 --> 12:50.108
Bedroom one.

12:53.879 --> 12:55.847
Bedroom two.

13:07.793 --> 13:09.727
The dining room.

13:12.164 --> 13:14.766
Kitchen.

13:14.768 --> 13:16.834
Hey, Matt, can you go downstairs
for me, please?

13:16.836 --> 13:18.303
You got it.

13:18.305 --> 13:20.004
Hoyt's room.

13:20.006 --> 13:22.740
Cody's room.

13:22.742 --> 13:24.609
Got the basement.

13:26.111 --> 13:28.112
And this is the old butcher room.

13:29.281 --> 13:31.182
Oh, my God!

13:31.184 --> 13:32.784
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:32.786 --> 13:34.819
I didn't mean...
just the cameras.

13:34.821 --> 13:36.854
And I thought you knew I was here.

13:36.856 --> 13:38.923
It's all right. Just don't
sneak up on people like that.

13:38.925 --> 13:40.658
I know. It was stupid.
I'm sorry.

13:40.660 --> 13:43.161
- All right.
- This works. God damn it, Ray.

13:43.163 --> 13:46.197
The blind spot's going
to be on you, man.

13:46.199 --> 13:48.600
If you guys need to review
any footage, just let me know.

13:48.602 --> 13:50.234
And I'll set it up
right here.

13:50.236 --> 13:52.170
I got motion detectors
across most of the property.

13:52.172 --> 13:54.372
So if something moves,
we're going to know about it.

13:54.374 --> 13:57.642
Also I programmed most of the sensors
to detect only large objects.

13:57.644 --> 14:00.712
I don't want the local wildlife
having us chase ghosts all night.

14:02.615 --> 14:04.382
All right.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.434
August 2nd.

14:56.436 --> 14:59.303
It's my first official night
here at the ranch.

15:00.340 --> 15:02.240
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:02.242 --> 15:04.342
Are you in here
talking to yourself?

15:04.344 --> 15:06.878
Um, no.
Actually it's the camera.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.846
I use it as a video journal.

15:08.848 --> 15:12.684
Oh. What happened to the days
of the mighty pen and paper?

15:12.686 --> 15:16.721
Is that still a thing, or...
Sadly, they are gone.

15:16.723 --> 15:18.723
Hmm. Well, as long as you
don't use this thing

15:18.725 --> 15:21.392
for any midnight photography...

15:21.394 --> 15:22.694
Scout's honor.

15:22.696 --> 15:24.862
Oh, good.

15:24.864 --> 15:27.298
- I got that on tape.
- You did.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.801
- And tape.
- Right.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.102
So how long have you known Sam?

15:31.104 --> 15:32.837
A couple months.

15:32.839 --> 15:36.941
Listen, uh, I actually would
prefer this to be off.

15:36.943 --> 15:38.276
It's actually this button.

15:38.278 --> 15:39.944
Well, that is good to know.

17:05.364 --> 17:07.365
What the hell was that?

17:11.837 --> 17:13.436
They're on the roof!

17:15.007 --> 17:17.340
Shh.

17:18.477 --> 17:19.911
What the hell is it?

17:19.913 --> 17:20.944
Is that the...

17:20.946 --> 17:22.313
shh.

17:24.483 --> 17:26.384
Shit.

17:36.862 --> 17:40.131
Oh, my God.
You guys. You guys!

17:46.205 --> 17:47.505
I'll get the ladder.

17:47.507 --> 17:49.240
Careful going up, Britain.

18:16.535 --> 18:18.102
Wait, Lisa, what...

18:18.104 --> 18:20.538
Matt, don't.
Rabies.

18:20.540 --> 18:23.174
You ever seen anything
like that before, Hoyt?

18:24.309 --> 18:27.078
Hell no.
Nothing like this.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.147
There's no trauma.
The internal organs are fine.

18:30.149 --> 18:34.185
It was definitely the tone
that messed with their sonar.

18:35.420 --> 18:37.622
Uh-huh.

18:37.624 --> 18:40.524
This is just the beginning.

18:48.935 --> 18:50.334
I'm gonna get some sleep.

18:50.336 --> 18:52.136
Good luck with that.

18:52.138 --> 18:53.537
I'm going to document it
as the tone.

18:53.539 --> 18:55.339
Yeah, absolutely.

18:55.341 --> 18:56.908
I need you to check more.

18:56.910 --> 18:59.110
We've already checked...

19:08.187 --> 19:11.989
hello. Please leave
a message after the tone.

19:11.991 --> 19:15.660
Hello, Mr. Miller, this is
Dr. David at white oak psychiatric.

19:15.662 --> 19:18.629
I wanted to talk to you about your
wife's progress over the last month.

19:18.631 --> 19:21.065
If you could give me a call
at your earliest convenience,

19:21.067 --> 19:22.266
I'd appreciate it.

19:32.244 --> 19:34.011
Oh, my God. Sorry.

19:34.013 --> 19:35.513
Ok. It's ok.

20:00.739 --> 20:03.441
- You guys all right?
- Yeah.

20:03.443 --> 20:06.177
Good. 'Cause I'm going to need you
to follow me out to the pasture.

20:06.179 --> 20:08.279
What's going on?

20:11.049 --> 20:14.652
MDE never mentioned anyone else
coming up to the property.

20:14.654 --> 20:16.554
I don't think that's them.

20:16.556 --> 20:20.024
He's been sitting out there
about 35, 45 minutes.

20:20.026 --> 20:22.994
There's no plates on it.
Is that thing military?

20:22.996 --> 20:24.595
I don't know.
It's hard to tell.

20:27.032 --> 20:29.400
Well, maybe it's someone
who got lost.

20:31.203 --> 20:34.071
He's on the move.
He's turning around.

20:44.349 --> 20:47.318
Sam, wait. Hang on.
I have a question.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.520
What do you think, Ray?

20:49.522 --> 20:51.355
I don't know.
But it's not right.

20:51.357 --> 20:53.124
No. It sure ain't right.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.593
I've never seen anybody
out there like that. No way.

20:57.730 --> 21:00.097
Look, I'm team leader
of this thing.

21:00.099 --> 21:04.168
If you are the team leader,
then you're supposed to know...

21:04.170 --> 21:07.738
look, Hoyt, I don't know every vehicle
that's going to come on to the ranch.

21:07.740 --> 21:10.808
Hey, calm down.
Listen, figure it out.

21:18.383 --> 21:21.085
OK, so I ran an analysis
on that tone from last night.

21:21.087 --> 21:23.254
Turns out there were actually
two sounds on that tape.

21:23.256 --> 21:27.491
There was that high-pitched noise that we
obviously know, the one that woke us up.

21:27.493 --> 21:29.293
But below that I found
traces of infrasound.

21:29.295 --> 21:31.395
Infrasound?

21:31.397 --> 21:33.831
Yeah, it's a frequency below the
audible range of the human ear.

21:33.833 --> 21:36.100
So what could cause
something like that?

21:36.102 --> 21:39.303
I mean, infrasound can occur
naturally or it can be manmade.

21:39.305 --> 21:41.205
You know,
at certain cycles per second,

21:41.207 --> 21:43.674
the military has actually
successfully tested infrasound

21:43.676 --> 21:47.411
to cause things like vertigo,
depression, fear, anxiety,

21:47.413 --> 21:51.749
physical lesions, throat pressure,
all sorts of awful side effects.

21:51.751 --> 21:54.085
And, I mean, those are just
the ones that we know about.

21:54.087 --> 21:56.554
Ok. And how about naturally?

21:56.556 --> 21:58.856
All the big natural disasters
that we know of...

21:58.858 --> 22:01.725
volcanoes, earthquakes, avalanches.

22:01.727 --> 22:05.329
It's why animals are able to detect
earthquakes before people do.

22:05.331 --> 22:06.797
They pick up the vibrations.

22:06.799 --> 22:09.333
Animals... whales...
they use inaudible sounds

22:09.335 --> 22:12.336
to paralyze and catch certain prey,
like, you know, fish.

22:12.338 --> 22:14.538
I'm just saying
that the sound we heard

22:14.540 --> 22:16.707
that Matt's talking about could've
been caused by a live animal.

22:16.709 --> 22:19.510
We have no idea what
we're dealing with here.

22:19.512 --> 22:22.646
How the fuck would
a whale get up here?

22:39.197 --> 22:40.598
So what are we doing out here?

22:40.600 --> 22:42.466
Oh, it's really well
documented that attempting

22:42.468 --> 22:44.602
to communicate with
paranormal energies directly

22:44.604 --> 22:47.138
really increases
likelihood of contact.

22:47.140 --> 22:49.540
Follow me.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.609
After you.

23:06.758 --> 23:10.861
Sam has asked me to come and do
a blessing on the property

23:10.863 --> 23:15.766
to communicate with the energy
that speaks from this earth.

23:15.768 --> 23:17.668
But you need to know.

23:17.670 --> 23:20.538
This land is forsaken by my people.

23:20.540 --> 23:23.174
And it's only to try and
bring you some protection

23:23.176 --> 23:25.676
that I've agreed to come.

23:25.678 --> 23:28.946
There are legends of warriors
hunting in this valley,

23:28.948 --> 23:33.851
returning to their tribe
disturbed and changed.

23:33.853 --> 23:37.788
Stories of whole tribes
disappearing.

23:37.790 --> 23:41.392
There is a darkness in this soil.

23:41.394 --> 23:44.795
I would not feel right if I
didn't suggest that you leave now

23:44.797 --> 23:49.801
or to say that this place has
nothing for you but suffering.

23:50.803 --> 23:54.672
I also know that you've
chosen to stay.

23:54.674 --> 23:58.742
And I'll do what I can to bring some
light here, no matter how small.

24:02.814 --> 24:07.218
I ask for silence now while I
reach out to my ancestors.

24:46.791 --> 24:49.860
Ahh. Ahh.

24:51.296 --> 24:54.898
Are you ok?
Can you breathe?

24:59.571 --> 25:01.639
Sam.

25:12.050 --> 25:15.586
There's nothing I can do for you.

25:15.588 --> 25:17.855
You need to get
the fuck out of here.

25:36.074 --> 25:39.543
Uh, 1:00 A.M. on the 4th.

25:39.545 --> 25:43.914
Um, already low on sleep after
the events of the other night.

25:43.916 --> 25:46.884
Sam seems to think we're close
to getting something concrete,

25:46.886 --> 25:49.053
some... some kind of evidence.

25:49.055 --> 25:51.755
I admit the sound, the dead bats...

25:51.757 --> 25:54.692
strange, certainly.

25:54.694 --> 25:57.561
Paranormal?

25:57.563 --> 25:59.530
I'm not so sure.

26:00.866 --> 26:02.900
Hang on.

26:06.037 --> 26:07.371
So what's up?

26:07.373 --> 26:08.939
Ray's got something.
Come on.

26:18.083 --> 26:19.717
So what do we got?

26:19.719 --> 26:21.485
Just a second ago,
something very large set off

26:21.487 --> 26:23.020
one of the sensors
in the blind spot.

26:23.022 --> 26:24.822
Zone three, specifically.

26:24.824 --> 26:26.957
So we're talking about
something bigger than a deer.

26:26.959 --> 26:29.593
Try the size of a
god damn helicopter.

26:40.071 --> 26:41.672
All right.

26:41.674 --> 26:43.974
Cameron, check the far
side of the field.

26:43.976 --> 26:46.643
The rest of you guys, come with me.

27:34.626 --> 27:36.994
Over here!

27:52.043 --> 27:54.778
This is not a natural death.

27:54.780 --> 27:56.880
What about an animal attack?

27:56.882 --> 28:01.118
Oh, no. There are no bite marks,
no claw marks.

28:01.120 --> 28:05.155
These incisions, they're perfect.

28:05.157 --> 28:07.090
Sorry, girl.

28:14.132 --> 28:15.599
No blood.

28:15.601 --> 28:18.001
It's almost surgical.

28:19.871 --> 28:21.205
Shit.

28:21.207 --> 28:22.940
All right,
I want to bag the whole thing.

28:22.942 --> 28:25.609
Matt, get the bag.

28:30.582 --> 28:32.516
What is it?

28:32.518 --> 28:35.018
Come on, Sam, if you're going
to do it, do it quick.

29:34.145 --> 29:35.679
Hi, Lisa.

29:35.681 --> 29:37.948
Hey, Sam.
Hey, Britain.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.216
Hey.

29:40.285 --> 29:41.852
Blood?

29:41.854 --> 29:44.988
Oh, yeah.
I had a nosebleed last night.

29:44.990 --> 29:46.990
You prone to nose bleeds?

29:46.992 --> 29:49.126
Uh, no.

29:49.128 --> 29:51.161
And I've had a couple
since I've been here.

29:51.163 --> 29:53.897
I'm thinking
it's just the elevation or...

29:53.899 --> 29:55.766
Maybe.

29:57.703 --> 29:59.303
Come on, Britain.

30:03.808 --> 30:07.844
And you knew to check the tape
because she had a few bloody noses?

30:07.846 --> 30:09.746
Just a hunch.

30:09.748 --> 30:11.949
I don't think we can tell him.

30:11.951 --> 30:14.117
Tell him what?
How would you even explain this?

30:14.119 --> 30:18.722
You don't. You want to see
something even crazier?

30:18.724 --> 30:22.059
This is a tape from the 9th.

30:22.061 --> 30:24.127
August 8th.

30:24.129 --> 30:26.730
Oh, my God.

30:26.732 --> 30:30.734
August 7th.
11:11 every night.

30:30.736 --> 30:32.169
Ray, what time is it?

30:32.171 --> 30:34.838
It's 11:09.

30:38.876 --> 30:40.644
What time is it, Matt?

30:40.646 --> 30:42.179
It's almost 10 after.
Ray, check the camera.

30:42.181 --> 30:43.981
You guys, what's going on?

30:43.983 --> 30:45.782
What are you guys doing?
Sam, what's going on?

30:45.784 --> 30:47.784
Matt, I need you to give me
an exact count up to 11:11.

30:47.786 --> 30:49.119
- You understand?
- All right, camera's good.

30:49.121 --> 30:50.988
- Why?
- Camera's good.

30:50.990 --> 30:53.090
- Where are we at right now?
- You're at a minute right now.

30:53.092 --> 30:54.758
- What are you guys doing?
- Can you come outside for just a second?

30:54.760 --> 30:56.326
Sure. Sure. Yeah. Wait a minute.
What are you guys doing?

30:56.328 --> 30:58.996
Wait a second! This is my house.
What are you guys doing?

30:58.998 --> 31:02.666
All right, look, the last couple
of nights at exactly 11:11,

31:02.668 --> 31:04.301
energy has moved through the house.

31:04.303 --> 31:06.003
Sam, you're at 45 seconds.

31:06.005 --> 31:09.706
- An energy in this house?
- Yeah.

31:09.708 --> 31:12.743
What do you mean "an energy"?
What are you talking about?

31:14.380 --> 31:16.279
- No, we don't need...
- You don't need the gun!

31:19.785 --> 31:21.284
Where we at?
30 seconds?

31:21.286 --> 31:23.186
All right, no matter what you see,

31:23.188 --> 31:25.722
no matter what you guys see,
the camera goes first.

31:25.724 --> 31:27.190
I'm putting it down.

31:27.192 --> 31:29.860
Okay.

31:29.862 --> 31:32.863
Ok, we're at
10... 9... 8...

31:32.865 --> 31:36.800
7... 6... 5...

31:40.204 --> 31:42.205
11:11.

31:45.777 --> 31:48.145
Nothing.

31:50.349 --> 31:53.750
Cody! Cody!

31:53.752 --> 31:55.819
Cody! Cody!

31:55.821 --> 31:58.388
Hey, Cody! Cody!

31:58.390 --> 31:59.956
Cody, buddy, it's daddy.

32:04.262 --> 32:05.996
Sam, get back.

32:10.468 --> 32:11.768
Cody!

32:12.870 --> 32:13.970
Cody.

32:31.189 --> 32:32.322
Cody!

32:33.324 --> 32:35.392
Cody?

33:02.954 --> 33:05.489
Matt, Lisa.

33:08.092 --> 33:09.993
Get in here.

33:11.329 --> 33:13.263
What the hell is this?

33:13.265 --> 33:15.398
Matt, you go get her kit.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.268
We need to cast all these prints.

33:18.270 --> 33:23.039
Look at all these tracks.
Where did they come from?

33:37.922 --> 33:39.956
These are definitely canine prints.

33:39.958 --> 33:41.892
But they're enormous.

33:45.963 --> 33:48.532
Anything?
Nothing yet.

33:48.534 --> 33:50.934
How's Hoyt?

33:50.936 --> 33:52.569
For better or worse, he's got
a lot of alcohol in him now.

33:52.571 --> 33:54.404
But it seems like he's calmed down.

33:57.809 --> 34:00.210
You guys, I got something.

34:09.219 --> 34:11.388
It says "for emergencies only."

34:28.306 --> 34:30.373
What the hell is that, Sam?

34:33.377 --> 34:36.580
Make a call right now.

34:36.581 --> 34:38.348
Sam!

34:38.350 --> 34:40.583
No one's picking up.

34:40.585 --> 34:42.252
Do you have another
number for them?

34:42.254 --> 34:44.254
No.

34:44.255 --> 34:45.522
- Sam, someone's...
- What do you want me to do, Lisa?

34:45.524 --> 34:47.958
I'm just saying...

34:50.428 --> 34:51.995
yeah.

34:51.996 --> 34:54.063
I did call, yes.

34:54.065 --> 34:56.166
Well, what we have...

34:56.168 --> 34:57.601
you're saying they were here?

34:57.603 --> 35:00.470
- From '67 to '71.
- Doing what?

35:00.472 --> 35:04.174
Look, you guys are looking
at this the wrong way, ok?

35:04.176 --> 35:05.876
They answered all my questions.

35:05.878 --> 35:07.477
They offered to provide
documentation.

35:07.479 --> 35:09.179
They're not trying
to hide anything.

35:09.181 --> 35:12.115
They did? They answered
your question... your questions?

35:12.117 --> 35:14.251
What the hell are
you talking about?

35:14.253 --> 35:16.119
They answered all my
questions, Hoyt.

35:16.121 --> 35:19.422
My goodness gracious, they did?

35:19.424 --> 35:21.391
They didn't find anything, ok?

35:21.393 --> 35:23.460
I want to talk to you for a second.

35:23.462 --> 35:25.462
They were here.
They were here.

35:25.464 --> 35:28.198
Wait. Wait.
Just listen to me one second!

35:28.200 --> 35:29.199
- Listen to me!
- Matt!

35:29.201 --> 35:30.533
They were here?

35:30.535 --> 35:32.202
You're telling me they were here.

35:32.204 --> 35:35.005
They were here before
my boy was taken.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.573
Better science.

35:36.575 --> 35:38.975
You're just talking.
You're just talking.

35:38.977 --> 35:41.111
You're not saying anything.
You just say, "blah, blah, blah."

35:41.113 --> 35:43.580
That's the way you live your life.
You just talk.

35:43.582 --> 35:45.548
I'm talking about something
real here.

35:45.550 --> 35:47.384
I'm talking about my boy.

35:47.386 --> 35:50.487
Look, we had no idea until I
just had that phone call.

35:50.489 --> 35:53.623
But them being here has
nothing to do with your boy.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.458
You understand, Hoyt?

35:55.460 --> 35:58.595
Why? Why does it have nothing
to do with my boy? Tell me.

35:58.597 --> 36:00.063
Do... do you have an answer?

36:00.065 --> 36:02.999
Excuse me.

36:03.001 --> 36:05.702
Lisa, you are a scientist.

36:07.638 --> 36:11.541
What are you investigating?
What are you trying to find?

36:11.543 --> 36:14.110
Are you trying to find my boy?

36:14.112 --> 36:16.513
Are you trying to find my son?

36:16.515 --> 36:19.950
Just look me in the eye and tell me
that you're trying to find my son.

36:19.952 --> 36:21.618
Are you trying to find my son?

36:21.620 --> 36:23.653
- I'm trying to help you.
- How you trying to help me?

36:23.655 --> 36:26.156
You're trying to help yourself.

36:26.158 --> 36:28.024
I'm on to you.

36:29.327 --> 36:32.128
You'd better watch out.

36:32.130 --> 36:34.698
You'd better watch yourself.

36:37.735 --> 36:39.669
Put it down.

36:48.346 --> 36:50.146
This is what I was
telling you about.

36:50.148 --> 36:52.282
Guys, I found two more
containers buried in the shed.

36:52.284 --> 36:54.150
Now, one was empty like
the first one I found.

36:54.152 --> 36:56.720
But the second had this in it.

36:56.722 --> 36:59.222
- What is this?
- It's a U-matic tape.

36:59.224 --> 37:01.758
Mostly used in the late
'60s and early '70s.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.626
And, Sam, that would correspond
to the timeframe

37:03.628 --> 37:06.129
that MDE said they were
originally on the property.

37:06.131 --> 37:09.399
I'm not sure offhand if we have
anything on site I can check this with.

37:09.401 --> 37:12.235
I'll see what I can
put together, all right?

37:17.175 --> 37:19.776
Late night.
August 12th.

37:19.778 --> 37:23.747
Apparently MDE was out here in the
'60s looking into this thing.

37:23.749 --> 37:28.718
The box we found in the shed
said "for emergencies only."

37:28.720 --> 37:31.321
And it was empty.

37:31.323 --> 37:34.124
I would, uh, probably be
more concerned about that

37:34.126 --> 37:37.427
if I hadn't seen what
looked like Hoyt's son

37:37.429 --> 37:39.529
tear through the house,

37:39.531 --> 37:42.799
go into a shed,
and completely disappear.

37:42.801 --> 37:46.803
He was gone.
I... I can't explain it.

37:46.805 --> 37:49.639
I feel like Sam is so obsessed
with finding evidence

37:49.641 --> 37:51.341
about what's happening here

37:51.343 --> 37:55.211
that he won't even
question MDE's motives.

40:28.399 --> 40:30.266
Aah!

40:43.847 --> 40:46.583
So, Lisa, you've never
seen anything like this?

40:46.585 --> 40:48.351
No.

40:52.656 --> 40:54.691
That's it, then.

40:54.693 --> 40:56.926
Let's go hunting.

41:18.415 --> 41:20.683
There should be tracks, right?

41:20.685 --> 41:23.786
I think we should be looking for
the tracks we found in the shed.

41:23.788 --> 41:26.256
It has to be the same animal.

41:26.258 --> 41:29.592
And just judging by the size
of the wolf we saw,

41:29.594 --> 41:32.729
I'd say it was easily 500 pounds,
which is five times larger...

41:32.731 --> 41:34.264
Guys!

41:35.032 --> 41:37.333
That thing is huge.

41:42.373 --> 41:43.840
Come on, let's go get it.

41:43.842 --> 41:45.975
Come on, that's what
we're here for. Go!

42:25.783 --> 42:28.451
We got to go the rest of the way
on foot, he's right out there.

42:28.453 --> 42:30.620
All right, let's go.

42:30.622 --> 42:33.323
Easy now.

42:35.025 --> 42:36.893
Easy now.

42:56.480 --> 43:00.416
Look at that.
I want to go back now.

43:04.955 --> 43:06.723
Ok.

43:06.725 --> 43:07.924
Easy. Wait. Slow down.
I'll be right there.

43:07.926 --> 43:09.559
Careful! Careful!

43:09.561 --> 43:11.761
Hoyt, where'd it go?

43:11.763 --> 43:15.832
I don't see it.
Be careful.

43:15.834 --> 43:17.934
Guys, over here!

43:17.936 --> 43:20.770
Wait, Sam, did you see the light?

43:22.573 --> 43:25.541
- What is it?
- There was a light.

43:27.711 --> 43:30.380
I bet it's a cave system.

43:30.382 --> 43:32.982
I got some ropes in my truck.
Let me go get 'em.

43:32.984 --> 43:35.385
- All right.
- You guys be careful.

43:35.387 --> 43:36.886
That thing's still
out here somewhere.

44:10.854 --> 44:12.889
Sam, you're gonna want to see this.

44:24.168 --> 44:26.469
How old do you think that is?

44:28.505 --> 44:31.040
Jesus, Sam, what's going on really?

44:31.042 --> 44:33.509
What the hell we even looking at?

44:40.083 --> 44:42.652
Ray, look at this!

44:44.955 --> 44:47.857
Looks like we found our artist.

44:49.827 --> 44:51.160
Shh. Shh.

44:57.167 --> 45:00.136
How the hell would that thing
even get down here?

45:01.606 --> 45:04.540
Oh, God! Go!
Come on!

45:08.179 --> 45:10.079
Matt!

45:10.081 --> 45:11.147
Come on! Come on!
I said hurry! Let's go!

45:11.149 --> 45:14.183
Matt, the rope!

45:14.185 --> 45:16.919
Britain first!
Come on, turn off the camera.

45:20.691 --> 45:24.126
August 13th.
We just...

45:28.699 --> 45:31.234
the wolf, I don't know...

45:34.172 --> 45:37.640
come and take a closer look
at the artwork in the morning.

45:40.010 --> 45:43.079
Could be a vimana, right?

45:43.081 --> 45:44.647
A what?

45:44.649 --> 45:46.182
A vimana.

45:46.184 --> 45:48.718
Huh?

45:48.720 --> 45:51.654
In India, they've uncovered
all these ancient texts

45:51.656 --> 45:54.891
and documents that describe a
flying spacecraft called a vimana.

45:54.893 --> 45:58.294
And I mean, it looks...
it looks just like this.

45:58.296 --> 46:01.063
Even though that stuff is,
like, 6,000 years old

46:01.065 --> 46:02.665
and a lot of people
think it's myth,

46:02.667 --> 46:04.767
experts in our field
think that, you know,

46:04.769 --> 46:07.169
based on the schematics and the
flight plans and the design

46:07.171 --> 46:11.207
that it's as modern as
anything you'd see today.

46:11.209 --> 46:14.744
Are you suggesting that
our native painted a spacecraft

46:14.746 --> 46:16.946
on the inside of this cave?

46:16.948 --> 46:18.814
Yeah.

46:20.317 --> 46:22.285
Just, I know everything we've seen.

46:22.287 --> 46:24.120
That just seems pretty astounding.

46:24.122 --> 46:25.821
- Well, it's, like, a perfect match.
- And the wolf?

46:25.823 --> 46:28.157
This is bigger than
a wolf or missing kid.

46:38.969 --> 46:40.736
How do you even know
he's back here?

46:40.738 --> 46:43.806
He's working on the ATV.

46:52.349 --> 46:57.253
Just wanted to say I completely
lost my perspective back there.

46:57.255 --> 46:58.955
And, uh...

46:58.957 --> 47:01.123
I'm really sorry.

47:02.893 --> 47:05.895
Stuff like that
happens sometimes, you know.

47:08.732 --> 47:11.133
You know, uh...

47:16.173 --> 47:20.376
Cody, on his birthday,
he woke his mother up

47:20.378 --> 47:25.014
with a handful of wildflowers he
picked in that field right out there.

47:25.016 --> 47:27.650
And she looked at him,
and she said,

47:27.652 --> 47:32.688
"son, what... it's your birthday.
Why... why you giving me flowers?"

47:32.690 --> 47:38.260
And he said, "well, because you're
the reason I got born, ma."

47:41.632 --> 47:43.366
That's the kind of kid he was.

47:43.368 --> 47:46.002
He is.

47:46.004 --> 47:48.204
That's Cody.

47:50.907 --> 47:55.144
Listen, um,

47:55.146 --> 47:57.947
I'm sorry I gave you a hard time
the other night at the table.

47:57.949 --> 48:00.783
It's just... I don't...

48:00.785 --> 48:04.820
I don't understand
your techniques. And, uh...

48:07.090 --> 48:09.692
I just want you to know
I appreciate you're here.

48:11.862 --> 48:14.697
And, um,

48:14.699 --> 48:18.134
I mean, it's the only thing
that gives me any hope.

49:07.217 --> 49:09.018
Nothing.

50:02.038 --> 50:03.939
That doesn't make sense at all.

50:04.942 --> 50:06.308
Shh!

50:24.427 --> 50:26.562
Aah!

51:41.605 --> 51:42.972
What's the problem?

51:42.974 --> 51:45.507
The pasture cam's down.

51:45.509 --> 51:47.509
Matt, take this walkie
and go out there.

51:47.511 --> 51:49.378
Won't even take you
two minutes, man.

51:49.380 --> 51:51.914
- All right, Sam, can you...
- Just do it, Matt!

51:53.284 --> 51:55.017
Take me through
all the exterior cams.

51:55.019 --> 51:56.218
All right.

52:02.959 --> 52:04.593
Do you copy?

52:04.595 --> 52:07.897
Give me 30 feet back for focus.
Thanks, buddy.

52:16.506 --> 52:18.440
Matt?

52:18.442 --> 52:19.909
Matt!

52:19.911 --> 52:21.243
Aah! Oh, my God!

52:21.245 --> 52:23.212
Go!

52:32.188 --> 52:34.690
Matt's up and about.

52:34.692 --> 52:38.460
He's pretty beat up,
but he should be fine.

52:38.462 --> 52:41.630
I have no explanation for
what happened to Hoyt's dog.

52:43.600 --> 52:46.068
Cameron, did you hear me?

52:46.070 --> 52:48.370
Yeah, I'm... sorry.

52:50.040 --> 52:53.175
Seriously, Sam, just back off.

52:53.177 --> 52:55.511
I mean it!

53:02.719 --> 53:04.219
Why are you doing this?

53:04.221 --> 53:05.521
What the hell is wrong with you?

53:05.523 --> 53:08.057
I was just picked up and thrown.

53:08.059 --> 53:10.492
And we don't have a single explanation
as to how that's even possible!

53:10.494 --> 53:12.661
Look, let me tell you
what's going down.

53:12.663 --> 53:14.730
I'm going to the E.R. then I'm
booking a flight out of here.

53:14.732 --> 53:17.399
And if you guys had, like,
an ounce of common sense,

53:17.401 --> 53:19.168
you'd all come with me!

53:19.170 --> 53:22.204
You need another driver so bad,
you hire someone else.

53:23.574 --> 53:26.008
Be careful, guys.
Seriously.

53:26.010 --> 53:28.510
You're an asshole, Sam!
You know that?

53:28.512 --> 53:30.646
Asshole!

53:36.319 --> 53:38.587
We still have Hoyt's truck.

53:40.757 --> 53:43.525
We can go in Hoyt's truck.

53:50.333 --> 53:52.568
So what's going on, Ray?

53:52.570 --> 53:56.505
Are you guys aware that Matt found
additional MDE materials in the shed,

53:56.507 --> 53:58.540
including a videotape?

53:58.542 --> 54:01.343
Yeah, he mentioned it. But I thought
it was too old to play up here.

54:01.345 --> 54:04.546
No. It turns out I was able
to find an old deck

54:04.548 --> 54:06.615
and transfer it to a hard drive.

54:06.617 --> 54:09.418
Ok. So what was on the tape?

54:12.288 --> 54:15.190
I think it's better if I
just play it for you guys.

54:47.791 --> 54:50.059
There. Right there.

55:12.415 --> 55:16.318
Rebecca, can you hear me?

55:42.378 --> 55:45.848
We're on our way back
in with Rebecca.

55:45.850 --> 55:49.118
About eight minutes out.

56:18.781 --> 56:21.383
Mommy? Mommy?

56:21.385 --> 56:23.218
Where's mommy?

56:23.220 --> 56:25.387
That's what we're trying
to figure out, Rebecca.

56:25.389 --> 56:27.523
You remember the last
time you were with her?

57:35.226 --> 57:36.825
How far out was she?

57:36.827 --> 57:39.228
Well beyond the pasture.

57:39.230 --> 57:41.663
And the dog?

57:41.665 --> 57:43.699
No.

57:56.613 --> 57:58.914
What's she doing?

58:05.755 --> 58:07.723
Michelle!

58:29.612 --> 58:31.546
Ahh.

58:31.548 --> 58:32.881
Aah!

58:32.883 --> 58:35.617
Aah!

58:35.619 --> 58:38.387
Aah!

59:43.886 --> 59:49.124
Ray played us the tape
that Matt had found in the shed.

59:50.860 --> 59:53.762
There's something
unexplainable out here.

59:53.764 --> 59:55.864
If that tape is to be believed,

59:55.866 --> 01:00:00.635
then I just witnessed the killing
of an entire team of people

01:00:00.637 --> 01:00:02.938
by something completely unknown.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.507
Why would they send us out here?

01:00:05.509 --> 01:00:07.709
Sam is so obsessed
with what's happening,

01:00:07.711 --> 01:00:10.412
we're hesitant to even
show him the tape.

01:00:10.414 --> 01:00:12.981
And Hoyt...

01:00:16.953 --> 01:00:19.821
I think we should go.

01:00:19.823 --> 01:00:21.857
We have to go.

01:00:25.995 --> 01:00:28.630
But I do not think that he is in a
place to make decisions right now.

01:00:28.632 --> 01:00:30.132
What the hell are we
supposed to do then?

01:00:30.134 --> 01:00:32.734
I say we leave tonight.
We have Hoyt's truck.

01:00:33.904 --> 01:00:35.837
Get behind me.

01:00:40.476 --> 01:00:42.043
Get in the truck.

01:00:42.045 --> 01:00:45.914
Get in the fuckin' truck!
Go! Get in the truck!

01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:48.083
Hey!

01:00:48.085 --> 01:00:49.484
Where is it?

01:00:49.486 --> 01:00:50.619
Lisa!

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:05.033
Shit!

01:01:07.838 --> 01:01:09.037
What the fuck is it doing?

01:01:09.039 --> 01:01:11.606
Ah, shit!

01:01:15.878 --> 01:01:18.447
Where did... where did it go?

01:01:18.449 --> 01:01:21.516
He just ran off.

01:01:22.618 --> 01:01:24.519
Are you OK, Lisa?
Are you OK?

01:01:24.521 --> 01:01:26.855
Aah.

01:01:26.857 --> 01:01:30.859
Lisa, no! No!

01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:33.628
What are you doing?
Stop it!

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:35.697
Lisa, stop!

01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:42.604
I don't remember anything.

01:01:42.606 --> 01:01:45.040
Nothing.

01:01:46.042 --> 01:01:47.742
We should've left with Matt.

01:01:47.744 --> 01:01:49.911
We're getting unprecedented
footage, guys.

01:01:49.913 --> 01:01:51.646
This is what we wanted.
This is why we came here.

01:01:51.648 --> 01:01:52.681
This is what we wanted?
People are getting hurt.

01:01:52.683 --> 01:01:54.149
What are you talking about, Sam?

01:01:54.151 --> 01:01:57.719
Look, I think the thing
is a single intelligence.

01:01:57.721 --> 01:02:00.188
Oh, for... you know something?

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.157
You're out of your mind.

01:02:02.159 --> 01:02:05.594
Look, we are so close.
We are right there.

01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:07.662
Close to what?

01:02:07.664 --> 01:02:11.132
What if this thing can turn into
an orb or a wolf or even Cody?

01:02:11.134 --> 01:02:12.667
Or me?

01:02:12.669 --> 01:02:15.203
Sam, seriously, it's fuckin' done.

01:02:15.205 --> 01:02:16.972
I don't want to be here
anymore, Sam.

01:02:16.974 --> 01:02:19.007
I can't be here anymore.

01:02:19.009 --> 01:02:20.775
Go pack your bag. I'll meet you at
the front door in five minutes.

01:02:20.777 --> 01:02:22.544
Ok, we are leaving.

01:02:22.546 --> 01:02:24.579
You're not going anywhere.
Cameron, please!

01:02:24.581 --> 01:02:28.083
Get your hands off me.
It's done, Sam!

01:02:28.085 --> 01:02:31.586
- Well, I'm not leaving!
- It's over! Stop!

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.007
Cody.

01:03:27.043 --> 01:03:28.610
Cody!

01:03:40.923 --> 01:03:42.891
I got your bag, Britain.

01:03:42.893 --> 01:03:44.359
I'm ready.

01:03:47.196 --> 01:03:48.663
We ready?

01:03:48.665 --> 01:03:50.131
What about Sam?

01:03:50.133 --> 01:03:51.166
He won't listen.
We'll send somebody back.

01:03:51.168 --> 01:03:53.101
Who gives a shit about Sam?

01:03:54.804 --> 01:03:56.004
Ray?

01:03:58.742 --> 01:04:02.377
What the fuck is this, Cameron?

01:04:02.379 --> 01:04:07.182
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:04:12.622 --> 01:04:15.757
Come on. Come on.
Let's go, Lisa!

01:04:15.759 --> 01:04:17.158
Go!

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.775
They're sending a van
first thing in the morning.

01:04:33.777 --> 01:04:35.210
In the morning?

01:04:35.212 --> 01:04:37.278
That's the soonest
they can get here, Lisa.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.980
That... that's great, Sam,

01:04:38.982 --> 01:04:40.782
considering we were just
out in Hoyt's driveway

01:04:40.784 --> 01:04:42.250
and his truck was
completely disassembled

01:04:42.252 --> 01:04:43.685
and we didn't hear
a God damn thing.

01:04:43.687 --> 01:04:45.654
- Leave anytime you want.
- How?

01:04:45.656 --> 01:04:48.857
Do you find it odd that the
moment we arrived on this ranch

01:04:48.859 --> 01:04:50.825
is when all this shit
started happening?

01:04:50.827 --> 01:04:52.360
He's right. We could be
part of a MDE experiment...

01:04:52.362 --> 01:04:54.162
what are you talking about?
You should know better.

01:04:54.164 --> 01:04:56.665
How do you explain what's
been happening here?

01:04:56.667 --> 01:04:59.968
How do you know MDE doesn't know
exactly what's here, Sam?

01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:01.936
I never should've asked you
to come here.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.374
Ok.
We're going to get home.

01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:09.344
Look at me.
We're going to get home.

01:05:52.988 --> 01:05:56.991
Cameron, there's something
wrong with Ray.

01:06:09.004 --> 01:06:10.438
Ray?

01:06:17.113 --> 01:06:19.481
Whoa. Put the gun down, Ray.

01:06:19.483 --> 01:06:22.016
All right?
Just... Ok.

01:06:22.018 --> 01:06:23.885
I don't want...

01:06:23.887 --> 01:06:26.187
No!

01:06:26.189 --> 01:06:28.990
Oh, my God!

01:06:42.104 --> 01:06:45.774
Aah.

01:07:01.824 --> 01:07:03.124
Go!

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.828
Come on now!

01:07:19.008 --> 01:07:20.942
Oh, God!

01:07:22.444 --> 01:07:24.212
Oh, shit.

01:07:30.553 --> 01:07:33.855
Listen to me. You go.
You get the ATV.

01:07:33.857 --> 01:07:36.491
Go! Go!

01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:44.465
Open the door!

01:07:44.467 --> 01:07:46.334
Open it!

01:07:46.336 --> 01:07:48.503
Get back!

01:07:55.011 --> 01:07:57.579
She's gone.
She's gone.

01:08:09.491 --> 01:08:11.860
In the barn.
Hurry!

01:08:16.398 --> 01:08:18.499
Sam!

01:08:21.871 --> 01:08:23.504
Whoa.

01:08:26.642 --> 01:08:29.010
Come on. Come on.

01:08:29.011 --> 01:08:30.178
Cameron!

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.180
Hang on, Sam!

01:08:40.022 --> 01:08:41.421
Sam!

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.667
Aah!

01:09:04.513 --> 01:09:06.481
Aah!
