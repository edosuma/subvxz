and I don't want to mess
with that, you know?

02:02.514 --> 02:04.289
Did you know she's working
with a life coach?

02:04.516 --> 02:07.126
Is that someone who coaches her

02:45.724 --> 02:47.482
27 years ago.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.669
But it's crazy.
I mean, maybe it's just a flyer

02:50.896 --> 02:52.671
for a Smashing Pumpkins concert.

02:52.822 --> 02:54.322
I already considered that.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.082
But I looked it up
and they're in Italy this week

02:56.235 --> 02:57.509
playing the pope's birthday.

02:57.661 --> 02:58.585
Okay, maybe you're right.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.678
Maybe this is about that day.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.346
But who would send this?

03:01.423 --> 03:03.407
I don't know.
What do we do? What do we do?

03:03.425 --> 03:05.517
Let me get you some lunch.
I think you're just hoopy.

03:05.669 --> 03:08.078
That's my expression
for hungry and loopy. Hoopy.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.597
Bob, Gayle needs a burger.
She's hoopy.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.766

through the pass-through at all.

03:14.937 --> 03:16.920

we would've had trouble hearing.

03:16.939 --> 03:18.030

03:30.860 --> 03:33.069

That's right.

Uh, kitchen.

-What? Why?

04:05.079 --> 04:08.247

who's messing with us.

04:08.398 --> 04:10.490

Throw 'em away. (grunts)

04:13.161 --> 04:15.403

hide your head in your butt

04:27.917 --> 04:30.936

terrible secret I told you about

-Don't go here.

07:28.465 --> 07:29.506
Bye.

07:29.599 --> 07:30.857
-Wait, no. Oh, my God.
-(door closes)

07:31.026 --> 07:32.842
We're officially
a "don't go there" place.

07:32.936 --> 07:34.177
You live
by the weird, old candy,

07:34.196 --> 07:35.954
you die by the weird, old candy.

07:36.105 --> 07:38.014
All right, we're closing
for a little bit.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.182
I'm gonna go buy
different candy.

07:39.201 --> 07:41.442
Stay here.
Lock the door behind me.

07:41.536 --> 07:42.869
You sweep, you dustpan,

07:42.963 --> 07:45.538
you, um, make sure
they sweep and dustpan.

07:45.691 --> 07:47.707
You know we're not gonna
do any of that stuff, right?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.301
I know, I know.
Just pretend, please.

07:49.452 --> 07:51.118
-I'm pretending we're done.
-Mm.

07:51.213 --> 07:54.121
Okay. "Who sent us
those letters?" brainstorm. Go.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.808
It has to be somebody
who saw us that night.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.868
But who?
We were so careful.

07:58.962 --> 08:00.870
I mean, were we?
Wait a minute.

08:00.889 --> 08:03.373
What about Marty Deblusio-Klein?
Remember?

08:03.466 --> 08:05.258
<i> We bumped into him</i>
<i> on our way out of school.</i>

08:05.410 --> 08:07.301
<i> GAYLE:</i>
<i> (gasps) That's right.</i>

08:07.321 --> 08:09.154
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> He came back because</i>
<i> he forgot his trumpet.</i>

08:09.347 --> 08:11.715
<i>We told him we were doing</i>
<i>marijuanas under the bleachers.</i>

08:11.883 --> 08:15.051
<i> -GAYLE: It was</i>
<i> the perfect alibi.</i>
<i> -LINDA: Or maybe</i>

08:15.070 --> 08:16.995
it wasn't.
Maybe he was suspicious.

08:17.222 --> 08:20.907
Hmm. Maybe we should pay
Marty Deblusio-Klein

08:21.001 --> 08:23.150
a little visit,
see if he sent us those letters.

08:23.228 --> 08:25.486
I heard he's living
at his mom's old house.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.005
Because he murdered her?

08:27.156 --> 08:28.840
No.
She moved to Florida.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.825
Because she murdered someone?

08:30.844 --> 08:33.345
No. Not everyone
murders someone, Gayle.

08:33.496 --> 08:34.738
That's not true.

08:34.756 --> 08:36.089
What is happening?

08:36.241 --> 08:38.408
GENE: We're exhausted
from watching the restaurant.

08:38.426 --> 08:40.260
How does it somehow
look worse in here?

08:40.354 --> 08:42.837
We actually did sweep a little,
but then we played in it.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.189
TINA:
We're taking a dirt nap.

08:44.340 --> 08:47.417
All right, so, I think
I did pretty good candy-wise.

08:47.510 --> 08:48.509
We want to trust you, Dad,

08:48.529 --> 08:49.936
but we don't want
to get hurt again.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.421
Are you sure it's candy
and not vitamins?

08:51.514 --> 08:54.407
I don't know.
Why don't you guys tell me.

08:55.093 --> 08:56.259
(kids exclaim)

08:56.278 --> 08:58.444
-Sour Sack Babies?
-Yeah, that's right.

08:58.597 --> 09:00.855
I asked a kid in the store
what the best candy was.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.432
His dad was concerned,

09:02.450 --> 09:05.043
but they both agreed
these were a huge get.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.120
I can't believe
these weren't sold out.

09:07.272 --> 09:09.196
Believe it, baby.
I found these three bags

09:09.216 --> 09:10.748
shoved back
behind some candy corn.

09:10.825 --> 09:13.777
Ugh. Now we have to give
these out to other people.

09:13.870 --> 09:16.279
It's not right.
(dry heaves)

09:16.448 --> 09:19.132
Tina, don't make that sound.
Look, how about this:

09:19.284 --> 09:20.725
whatever's left
at the end of the night,

09:20.877 --> 09:22.118
you kids can keep
for yourselves.

09:22.211 --> 09:24.454
-Deal.
-Yay!
-There he is. (sniffs)

09:24.547 --> 09:25.471
Whoa!

09:25.566 --> 09:27.399
Uh, okay.
Uh, take it easy, Louise.

09:27.550 --> 09:29.459
Give me some.
I want to rub them on my face.

09:29.461 --> 09:30.902
-Tina, stop.
-(whispering): Don't worry.

09:31.129 --> 09:32.404
We're gonna get you
out of there.

09:32.555 --> 09:33.479
Oh, my God.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.965
Wow, the house
hasn't changed a bit.

09:35.984 --> 09:37.483
They still have the cute
little bars on the windows.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.435
Wait, what are we
gonna say to him?

09:39.437 --> 09:41.154
Don't worry, Linda. I've been
working on talking to humans

09:41.306 --> 09:43.456
-with my life coach, Dane Kang.
-(doorbell rings)

09:43.642 --> 09:44.583
Happy Halloween.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.309
You didn't think we'd come here,

09:46.402 --> 09:48.069
-did you, Marty?
-Aah!

09:48.088 --> 09:50.422
You messed
with the wrong sisters.

09:50.573 --> 09:53.483
Wait, Gayle?
From high school? Linda?

09:53.576 --> 09:54.909
Hi, Marty.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.744
What is happening?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.004
You know what's happening.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.748
This is about
the pumpkin carving contest.

10:00.767 --> 10:01.933
What pumpkin carving contest?

10:02.085 --> 10:04.994
Uh, you know,
the one from 27 years ago?

10:05.013 --> 10:06.329
When we were in high school?

10:06.348 --> 10:07.847
Wait, you mean
the one that got canceled?

10:07.941 --> 10:10.166
Aha! Suddenly
Mr. "I Don't Know Anything

10:10.185 --> 10:12.185
About Pumpkin Carving Contests"

10:12.279 --> 10:15.447
knows a lot about a certain
pumpkin carving contest.

10:15.674 --> 10:17.431
So, you think I'm the one
who smashed all the pumpkins?

10:17.525 --> 10:20.267
And you waited 27 years
to confront me about it?

10:20.362 --> 10:21.845
I didn't do it, I promise.

10:21.863 --> 10:24.772
We know you didn't.
But you did write some letters,

10:24.866 --> 10:27.274
and we'd like to look
at your marker collection.

10:27.369 --> 10:28.501
Gayle, I'm starting to think

10:28.611 --> 10:29.961
that Marty
didn't write the letters.

10:30.188 --> 10:32.021
-What letters?
-Eh, maybe you're right.

10:32.115 --> 10:33.857
You know, I always thought
it was Scary Terry

10:33.875 --> 10:34.949
who smashed all those pumpkins.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.635
Huh.
Why would you think that?

10:36.786 --> 10:37.877
I mean, it's Scary Terry.

10:38.029 --> 10:39.045
And I heard
she entered the contest,

10:39.197 --> 10:40.530
so, you know, maybe she thought

10:40.548 --> 10:42.532
she wasn't gonna win,
so she smashed 'em all.

10:42.550 --> 10:45.310
(gasps) Maybe she's the one
who sent the letters.

10:45.461 --> 10:47.203
Do you know
where Scary Terry lives?

10:47.296 --> 10:48.963
I don't know where she lives,
but I know where she works.

10:49.132 --> 10:51.316
She's a pet groomer
down at To Groom It May Concern.

10:51.467 --> 10:54.227
-We're out of here.
-Aw, so nice to catch up
with you, Marty.

10:54.379 --> 10:56.546
I'm so glad we stopped by.
Love your costume.

10:56.564 --> 10:57.805
You're a great Smurf!

10:57.899 --> 11:00.884
I really hope Scary Terry's
not the one sending

11:00.902 --> 11:02.218
-those notes.
-I know.

11:02.311 --> 11:03.644
Remember
when she ate that spider?

11:03.738 --> 11:06.831
-Remember when she set
that bus stop on fire?
-Yeah.

11:07.058 --> 11:08.833
Oh, boy.
This is it.

11:08.985 --> 11:10.669
Huh. Doesn't look
like they're open.

11:10.820 --> 11:13.338
-Nobody's in there.
-Wait, look.
There's a dog in there.

11:13.489 --> 11:14.898
Or some kind of big squirrel?

11:14.916 --> 11:17.158
-I don't know. I'm a cat person.
-LINDA: That's creepy.

11:17.326 --> 11:19.068
It's just sitting there.
By itself.

11:19.162 --> 11:22.238
I guess they are open.
Should we go in?

11:22.331 --> 11:25.058
Hello?

11:26.335 --> 11:27.168
Oh, hello.

11:27.262 --> 11:29.412
-Aah!
-Aah!
-(dog barking)

11:29.505 --> 11:30.563
Oh, it is a dog.

11:35.086 --> 11:37.028
-Hi, Terry.
-Linda? Gayle?

11:37.221 --> 11:39.698
-Yeah. Yeah, it's us.
-Surprise.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.015
What are you doing here?

11:41.109 --> 11:43.535
And why are you backing away
from me?

11:43.704 --> 11:45.870
Uh, we're here 'cause, uh...

11:46.022 --> 11:47.613
-our car broke down.
-I have a UTI!

11:47.766 --> 11:50.542
-What?
-Yeah, we were driving
and then our car broke down

11:50.769 --> 11:53.861
and then Gayle's pee
was burning. Bad. Unrelated.

11:53.955 --> 11:57.106
So, we called a tow truck
and came in here to wait.

11:57.125 --> 11:59.776
(chuckles)
Anyway, what a surprise.

11:59.794 --> 12:01.277
You're here.

12:01.296 --> 12:03.871
Well, it's a real<i> treat</i>
to see both of you.

12:03.890 --> 12:04.872
Like "trick or treat"?

12:04.966 --> 12:07.450
(laughs loudly)

12:07.469 --> 12:08.560
I get it.

12:08.711 --> 12:10.970
(laughs loudly)
I like this.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.789
I better finish up
with Jasper here.

12:12.882 --> 12:14.399
Do you two want to sit?
We have chairs.

12:14.626 --> 12:17.218
I'd offer you something to eat,
but we only have dog treats.

12:17.295 --> 12:19.053
-I'll try a dog treat.
-Gayle, no.

12:19.147 --> 12:21.981
Uh, how long
you been grooming pooches?

12:22.133 --> 12:23.908
Long enough to do this.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.559
-Aah!
-Oh! (laughs)

12:25.728 --> 12:27.078
That's a fun trick

12:27.230 --> 12:29.973
that you shouldn't do again.

12:29.991 --> 12:31.491
I cut people hair, too.

12:31.659 --> 12:33.142
Not officially.
But I'll give you a great rate.

12:33.161 --> 12:35.086
Gayle, you look like
you could use a little touch-up.

12:35.313 --> 12:37.404
-Or Linda?
-No. More you.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.315
She seems like
she just got a haircut.

12:39.484 --> 12:42.076
-It looks great.
-Nope. Looks terrible. Awful.

12:42.170 --> 12:43.762
Uh, but we're fine.
We don't-we don't...

12:43.913 --> 12:44.988
we don't want
to take up your time.

12:45.006 --> 12:45.930
(whispers):
They're scared.

12:46.082 --> 12:46.948
(laughs)

12:47.008 --> 12:49.175
No, we're not scared.

12:49.327 --> 12:51.677
You know what?
On the house. Gayle, come.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.438
Come.
Come, come.

12:53.589 --> 12:54.773
(whimpers)

12:54.974 --> 12:57.275
Good girl.

12:57.502 --> 12:59.110
Oh, Gayle.

12:59.262 --> 13:00.427
Leave the bangs.

13:01.339 --> 13:02.781
-Happy Halloween.
-(door opens)

13:02.932 --> 13:04.674
I don't want to get ahead
of ourselves,

13:04.692 --> 13:06.175
but I think we might be turning
into a "do go there" place.

13:06.269 --> 13:08.177
Ugh.
We need to slow this down

13:08.271 --> 13:09.862
if we're gonna have
any left for us.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.956
Or we just go trick-or-treating
ourselves?

13:12.183 --> 13:13.440
No.
Later for that.

13:13.535 --> 13:15.776
Right now, we need to stay here
and figure out

13:15.796 --> 13:18.463
how to protect these poor,
innocent Sour Sack Babies

13:18.614 --> 13:20.632
from these horrible
actual babies.

13:20.859 --> 13:22.283
-Should we just give them cash?
-(door opens)

13:22.377 --> 13:24.952
Dang it. Here comes another one.
What's their problem?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.195
Trick or treat.

13:26.214 --> 13:27.806
Welcome.
Hope you like great candy,

13:27.957 --> 13:29.290
'cause we have Sour Sack Babies.

13:29.384 --> 13:31.309
-Yeah, I know.
-You know?
-(door opens)

13:31.460 --> 13:33.052
-Trick or treat.
-Trick or treat.
-Hey, there.

13:33.204 --> 13:34.887
Hang on. Just taking care
of grim reaper here.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.147
-Here you go.
-(door opens)

13:36.299 --> 13:37.723
-KIDS: Trick or treat.
-Oh, my God.

13:37.892 --> 13:39.075
You got to be
freaking kidding me!

13:39.077 --> 13:40.226
They're like ants.

13:40.378 --> 13:41.802
-Gimme, gimme, gimme!
-I want one!

13:41.822 --> 13:43.822
O-Okay, here. Everybody,
please, just wait your turn.

13:43.973 --> 13:45.381
Do you have
tropical Sour Sack Babies?

13:45.400 --> 13:49.052
-What?
-Tropical. Sour. Sack. Babies.

13:49.070 --> 13:50.236
No.
We have this kind.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.722
Y-You've done Halloween before,
right?

13:52.815 --> 13:53.832
Wait, grim reaper?

13:53.908 --> 13:55.074
-Y-You just took some.
-(door opens)

13:55.226 --> 13:56.650
-Thanks. Bye.
-KIDS: Trick or treat.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.670
Aah!
Make it stop!

13:58.821 --> 14:00.839
Good girl.
You're doing great.

14:01.066 --> 14:02.398
Yes, you are.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.676
You know, it's kind of funny

14:04.903 --> 14:08.713
that we're all together,
hanging out on Halloween.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.181
-What do you mean?
-Well,

14:10.333 --> 14:12.091
we were all
in that pumpkin contest

14:12.243 --> 14:14.744
that got canceled
back in high school.

14:14.762 --> 14:16.746
Oh, yeah.
That was a shame.

14:16.839 --> 14:18.748
You know, some people think

14:18.841 --> 14:21.934
that someone smashed
all the pumpkins on purpose.

14:22.087 --> 14:24.087
What? Who would
do something like that?

14:24.105 --> 14:26.197
Oh, I'm sure
they had a good reason.

14:26.349 --> 14:28.941
But if you knew who it was,
what would you do?

14:29.094 --> 14:31.761
Maybe send weird letters
to them?

14:31.779 --> 14:32.945
Something worse?
(chuckles)

14:33.098 --> 14:34.780
-(barks)
-Don't worry.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.023
Your daddy's coming soon.

14:36.117 --> 14:37.783
You guys know Mr. Rosenthal.

14:37.936 --> 14:40.269
Mr. Rosenthal?
Our principal from high school?

14:40.288 --> 14:42.696
Yeah. This is his dog.
He's on his way to pick him up.

14:42.716 --> 14:43.864
I'm sure he'd love to see you.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.050
FYI, he's older now.
It's noticeable.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.293
(chuckles):
Oh, wow.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.278
Yeah, yeah,
that'd be nice to see him.

14:49.297 --> 14:51.038
-Linda got older, too.
-You know what?

14:51.057 --> 14:53.224
Can I go get some product?
It's for wirehaired terriers,

14:53.301 --> 14:55.376
but your hair
has the same texture.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.895
Okay.

14:57.046 --> 14:58.730
-(squeak)
-BOTH: Aah!
-Dog toy.

14:58.957 --> 15:00.231
Gayle,
we got to get out of here.

15:00.458 --> 15:03.067
What? No. We got to figure out
if Terry sent the letters,

15:03.144 --> 15:05.128
and if she did,
we got to confront her

15:05.130 --> 15:06.905
and say "Stop it."
You'll do that part.

15:07.056 --> 15:08.740
Or my new plan.
We get out of here

15:08.967 --> 15:10.483
and send her
a strongly-worded email

15:10.577 --> 15:11.484
when we get home.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.802
And maybe
a negative Yelp review.

15:12.895 --> 15:14.137
KIDS: Trick or treat.

15:14.271 --> 15:15.896
-(indistinct chatter)
-I was here first.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.583
-Trick or treat.
-Ooh, Sour Sack Babies!

15:18.734 --> 15:21.310
Okay. Try-try and form a line.
Everyone.

15:21.404 --> 15:23.755
Parents, i-if you could
please control your kids?

15:23.906 --> 15:25.481
Grim reaper?
Are you serious?

15:25.500 --> 15:26.999
I can see that you just
put a baseball cap

15:27.168 --> 15:28.317
on top of your costume.

15:28.411 --> 15:29.835
Does your dad know
you're doing this?

15:29.988 --> 15:31.170
It's my dad's hat.

15:31.322 --> 15:33.005
Okay, fine.
Just take one.

15:33.158 --> 15:34.657
-But that's it.
-Father!

15:34.717 --> 15:36.842
Stop giving away candy!

15:36.937 --> 15:39.586
I can't help it.
It's stupid Halloween.

15:39.681 --> 15:40.846
Wait.
What's in Dad's bowl

15:40.999 --> 15:42.999
is our last bag!
We don't have any left

15:43.017 --> 15:44.350
for ourselves!
Somebody, do something!

15:44.444 --> 15:46.444
-Here. Here. Take it.
-There's just too many of them!

15:46.595 --> 15:48.504
-Here. Take it. Here.
-Why did Mom have
to leave us alone on the day

15:48.597 --> 15:50.931
-of the child zombie
candy-pocalypse?
-Here. Take it. Here.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.175
Gayle, come on.

15:52.193 --> 15:53.843
She's gonna come back
any second.

15:53.861 --> 15:55.436
No.
We're gonna see this through.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.621
What's she gonna do, kill us?

15:56.848 --> 15:59.106
I should trim your claws.
Uh, I-I mean, nails.

15:59.275 --> 16:01.275
Both of you.
I've got a great cutter.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.293
It's really sharp.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.854
-Yeah, okay, let's go.
-LINDA: Run. Run!

16:04.872 --> 16:07.023
-Run for the car!
-(barking)

16:07.192 --> 16:09.783
Oh!
And now the dog's chasing us!

16:09.803 --> 16:11.043
Hey!

16:11.196 --> 16:13.546
Run, Gayle, run!
We're gonna die!

16:13.640 --> 16:15.122
I'm too young to die!

16:15.141 --> 16:17.350
I'm so much younger than you!

16:21.389 --> 16:24.131
-Aah!
-Aah! Scary Terry!
-(barking)

16:24.225 --> 16:26.150
Linda! Gayle!
Jasper, come!

16:26.302 --> 16:28.711
Oh, God, why did we
park so far away?

16:28.730 --> 16:30.655
I don't know!
It seemed like a good spot!

16:30.806 --> 16:32.231
Wait.
Somebody's here.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.217
Help! Help!
We're being chased!

16:34.235 --> 16:36.219
Forget it, Gayle.
Let's just go!

16:36.237 --> 16:38.979
Linda? Gayle?
Is that you?

16:39.073 --> 16:41.982
Oh, hi, Principal Rosenthal.

16:42.076 --> 16:44.335
Well, hello.
I haven't seen you in years.

16:44.487 --> 16:46.245
-How are you?
-We're very good.

16:46.397 --> 16:48.172
You're still alive.
That's nice.

16:48.324 --> 16:51.067
It<i> is</i> nice.
I'm here to pick up my dog.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.568
He needed a haircut
'cause he's dressing up

16:52.661 --> 16:54.754
as James Spader from<i> Blacklist</i>
for Halloween.

16:54.906 --> 16:56.014
-(Jasper barking)
-Ja...

16:56.241 --> 16:58.074
-Jasper?
-LINDA: Oh, God,

16:58.092 --> 16:59.833
-here she comes!
-Help us.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.245
She's chasing us!
Aah!

17:02.263 --> 17:05.172
You come here, little man.
(kissing)

17:05.250 --> 17:07.767
I'm so sorry, Mr. Rosenthal.
He got out.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.193
Somebody opened his pen.

17:09.345 --> 17:11.512
Oh, sorry.
That was an accident.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.923
We were running because
we thought you were chasing us,

17:13.925 --> 17:15.700
but you were chasing the dog?

17:15.851 --> 17:17.017
No, I was chasing you, too.

17:17.111 --> 17:18.536
I have this great product.

17:18.687 --> 17:21.205
Remember? The thing I said
two seconds before you ran out?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.041
Why did you run out?
We were catching up.

17:23.268 --> 17:25.043
We were talking about
the pumpkin carving contest

17:25.303 --> 17:27.694
-that got canceled.
-Oh, God, I remember that.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.288
-Uh...
-You know, Linda,

17:29.382 --> 17:31.123
the sad thing is
we never got to announce

17:31.276 --> 17:34.277
-that you were...
-Shush, shush, shush,
shush, shush, shush, uh...

17:34.295 --> 17:36.612
Oh, I w... I-I was just gonna
say we were gonna announce...

17:36.705 --> 17:38.798
♪<i> Oh, we're singing</i> ♪

17:38.892 --> 17:42.209
-♪<i> Halloween, Halloween</i> ♪
-Oh, I was just gonna say
you were...

17:42.287 --> 17:45.246
-♪<i> It's such beautiful time</i>
<i> of year.</i> ♪
-What? What? What? What? What?

17:45.306 --> 17:47.290
-Linda, you're being weird.
-(Linda vocalizing)

17:47.308 --> 17:49.292
We never got to announce

17:49.310 --> 17:51.051
that you were the winner!

17:51.071 --> 17:53.796
-And you said it.
-Wait, what?

17:53.889 --> 17:56.074
-Linda was gonna win?
-Yeah.

17:56.301 --> 17:58.818
Linda, did you know
you were gonna win?

17:58.894 --> 18:01.079
I found out at school
the day before.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.322
<i> I was in the hall</i>
<i> on my way to poop</i>

18:03.474 --> 18:05.416
<i> when I heard</i>
<i> some teachers talking</i>

18:05.609 --> 18:07.476
<i> in the principal's office</i>
<i> about the pumpkin contest.</i>

18:07.495 --> 18:10.813
<i> Then I heard Mr. Rosenthal say</i>
<i>that I was gonna be the winner.</i>

18:10.832 --> 18:12.998
<i>That mine was the most creative.</i>

18:13.151 --> 18:15.318
-Creative?
-I knew you'd be crushed.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.002
I knew how hard
you worked on yours,

18:17.097 --> 18:18.429
and I just
couldn't let it happen.

18:18.581 --> 18:21.432
Wait, you dropped your pumpkin
on purpose?

18:21.659 --> 18:22.934
Sorta.
Yeah.

18:23.161 --> 18:25.085
So<i> you</i> smashed all the pumpkins?

18:25.105 --> 18:28.255
Sorry. If you want to arrest us,
I understand.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.366
Uh, I mean, me.
Gayle wasn't there.

18:30.426 --> 18:33.611
Wait a second. So, who sent us
those freakin' letters?

18:33.762 --> 18:35.855
-I don't know.
-MAN: I did.

18:36.007 --> 18:37.173
ALL:
Huh?

18:37.266 --> 18:39.117
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm life coach,

18:39.344 --> 18:41.101
personal trainer
and inventor Dane Kang.

18:41.195 --> 18:43.863
Hi, Dane Kang.
Wait, it was you?

18:43.957 --> 18:46.273
Yes, Gayle. Of course
I sent you the letters.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.941
And I'm proud of you.
You did it.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.869
I did?
What did I do?

18:49.963 --> 18:51.871
What the heck is going on?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.356
I knew the only way to get Gayle

18:53.374 --> 18:55.191
to confront her past
was to bring it back

18:55.284 --> 18:56.208
and shove it in her face.

18:56.361 --> 18:57.635
And if she rose
to the challenge,

18:57.862 --> 19:01.030
she could move forward
in all areas of her life

19:01.048 --> 19:02.715
<i> and</i> to the gold star level
of my program.

19:02.851 --> 19:04.124
Ooh.

19:04.202 --> 19:06.144
I didn't know
life coaches did that stuff.

19:06.295 --> 19:08.146
-Oh, they don't.
-Can I have your card?

19:08.297 --> 19:10.039
Well, why did you bring me
into all this?

19:10.132 --> 19:11.707
Gayle talks about you a lot.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.210
-No, not that much. Maybe once.
-We've had one session,

19:14.228 --> 19:16.212
and I feel like I've known you
all my life.

19:16.305 --> 19:18.138
Though I expected you
to be older and very ugly.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.324
Anyway, you're welcome.
You're all welcome.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.902
Now I got to go pretend to be
a client's long-lost love child.

19:23.054 --> 19:25.388
Bye, Dane Kang.
I'll call you Monday.

19:25.406 --> 19:26.722
Well, this was fun.

19:26.815 --> 19:28.891
You're gonna want to rub this in
with your fingertips.

19:28.984 --> 19:30.893
-Give me your hand.
-Okay.

19:30.986 --> 19:32.152
KIDS: Trick or treat.

19:32.246 --> 19:34.079
Here. Last one.
Yeah.

19:34.232 --> 19:36.657
No more Sour Sack Babies, okay?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.734
Oh, no. Don't-don't cry.

19:38.827 --> 19:41.754
Here. W-We have these.
Take as many as you want.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.848
-(sobbing)
-Oh, my God.

19:43.958 --> 19:45.165
Ugh.
Total disaster.

19:45.259 --> 19:47.076
And now we don't have
any Sour Sack Babies.

19:47.094 --> 19:48.744
This feels like rock bottom.

19:48.837 --> 19:50.188
I don't even know
if I have the energy

19:50.415 --> 19:51.597
to trick-or-treat anymore.

19:51.749 --> 19:54.600
I mean, we'll go,
but my heart won't be in it.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.693
Just my mouth.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.269
(sighs)
Well, good thing I saved

19:57.363 --> 19:59.363
three of these things
for you kids, huh?

19:59.515 --> 20:01.014
-TINA: Yay!
-GENE: Oh, my God!
-LOUISE: Yes!

20:01.034 --> 20:02.441
I could kiss you.
And I will.

20:02.593 --> 20:03.609
Give me those lips!

20:03.761 --> 20:06.779
I am never handing out
good candy again.

20:06.931 --> 20:09.040
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.
-Yep, yep, yep.

20:09.267 --> 20:11.116
I mean, what kind
of life coach does that?

20:11.211 --> 20:12.710
He's the best.
That's why

20:12.861 --> 20:14.286
-he's $400 a session.
-What?!

20:14.439 --> 20:15.880
But, you know,
the first two are free.

20:16.031 --> 20:17.289
And I think I'm fixed now,

20:17.442 --> 20:19.032
so I just need to cancel
your credit card.

20:19.126 --> 20:20.459
-Oh, God.
-(sighs) Linda,

20:20.611 --> 20:23.054
I wish you would've just told me
that you were gonna win

20:23.130 --> 20:24.889
that pumpkin carving contest.

20:25.116 --> 20:27.225
I know. But I guess
sometimes I don't tell you

20:27.452 --> 20:29.618
good stuff that happens to me
'cause I don't want to,

20:29.712 --> 20:31.062
you know, rub it in.

20:31.289 --> 20:34.306
When good things happen to you,
it<i> does</i> make me happy.

20:34.475 --> 20:35.716
Is this just because

20:35.735 --> 20:38.069
sometimes I fly
into violent rages of jealousy

20:38.220 --> 20:40.220
and cry in the closet
until I throw up?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.389
-Yeah, maybe.
-Well, I still want to know

20:42.408 --> 20:44.909
what's happening in your life.
I love you.

20:45.060 --> 20:46.911
You're my sister
and my best friend.

20:47.062 --> 20:48.579
And my archnemesis.

20:48.656 --> 20:50.139
I love you, too, Gayle.

20:50.232 --> 20:52.232
Also, my pumpkin
was way better than yours.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.402
Mr. Rosenthal's stupid.
Oh, speaking of pumpkins,

20:55.496 --> 20:57.070
look at those.
They're good.

20:57.164 --> 20:58.981
-Too good.
I want to go smash them!
