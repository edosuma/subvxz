02:21.014 --> 02:22.893
Morning, Kevin.

02:25.894 --> 02:29.230
Who do you love?

02:29.231 --> 02:31.190
What are you doing?

02:31.191 --> 02:34.193
I'm loving you the
way you love me.

02:34.194 --> 02:39.194
What do you mean?

02:45.038 --> 02:47.915
Gave you a little bit
of meds while...

02:47.916 --> 02:49.375
Ow. Ow.

02:49.376 --> 02:50.584
you were sleeping.

02:50.585 --> 02:52.712
That'll keep you
calm and cooperative

02:52.713 --> 02:54.255
and a little loopy.

02:54.256 --> 02:55.423
Don't worry about that.

02:55.424 --> 02:56.716
What, is this the fourth one?

02:56.717 --> 02:59.593
You know, I didn't want to put
your cell phone in the dryer.

02:59.594 --> 03:01.387
You text a lot,
but you really should use

03:01.388 --> 03:02.888
your delete key a
little more often.

03:05.892 --> 03:08.227
All right, give me that.
What are you...

03:08.228 --> 03:09.395
You want to tell me something?
What's that?

03:09.396 --> 03:11.480
What are you... okay.

03:13.483 --> 03:15.609
That's...

03:15.610 --> 03:18.195
okay, this is cute.

03:18.196 --> 03:21.574
Um...

03:21.575 --> 03:22.908
that's my phone.

03:22.909 --> 03:24.076
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

03:24.077 --> 03:25.536
You...

03:25.537 --> 03:28.039
are a cheater.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.624
I got you.

03:30.625 --> 03:32.126
What's this say?

03:32.127 --> 03:35.755
"I'm going 2 tell Sadie
it's over this weekend."

03:35.756 --> 03:37.965
When were you going
to tell me, honey?

03:37.966 --> 03:39.550
When were you going
to tell me it's over?

03:39.551 --> 03:41.385
After we were making
love a million times?

03:41.386 --> 03:42.803
After I sucked your dick?

03:42.804 --> 03:44.472
- Whoa, shush, shush. All right.
- What part of this weekend...

03:44.473 --> 03:46.932
what part of this weekend
were you going to tell me?

03:46.933 --> 03:49.268
Um...

03:49.269 --> 03:51.771
I know, okay?

03:51.772 --> 03:53.814
I made some texts,

03:53.815 --> 03:55.775
and they're fucking stupid texts.

03:55.776 --> 03:58.027
Yeah, they're stupid.
Here's one stupid text for you now.

03:58.028 --> 03:59.445
That's a dumb thing to fucking do.

03:59.446 --> 04:01.072
I'm going to read this
to you real quick.

04:01.073 --> 04:03.616
Last Friday, you text,

04:03.617 --> 04:06.327
- "I miss your magic pussy."
- You got to...

04:06.328 --> 04:09.121
What's magic about it, honey?

04:09.122 --> 04:10.456
Does she pull rabbits out of it?

04:11.917 --> 04:16.462
What the fuck happened to my head?

04:16.463 --> 04:20.800
You scorned me, Kevin.

04:20.801 --> 04:22.843
Oh, baby, I'm... I'm sorry.

04:22.844 --> 04:25.054
- You took my heart...
- I'm really sorry.

04:25.055 --> 04:26.806
and you...

04:26.807 --> 04:28.933
- you broke my heart.
- I'm sorry.

04:28.934 --> 04:31.644
And you did it with my
best friend Jennifer!

04:31.645 --> 04:34.438
I'm sorry, baby.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.315

04:40.320 --> 04:45.320
Thank you, handsome.

04:45.575 --> 04:48.285
That's, like, the second drink
he's given you on the house.

04:48.286 --> 04:49.662
Well, when you got it, you got it.

04:51.164 --> 04:53.624
Let the bartender know I'm the
one without the boyfriend.

04:53.625 --> 04:55.835
Yes, well,
I'll be without a boyfriend

04:55.836 --> 04:57.336
after this weekend.

04:57.337 --> 05:01.048
He'll be my fiancé.

05:01.049 --> 05:04.009
Really?

05:04.010 --> 05:07.555
I... I just don't see Kevin
as the marrying type.

05:07.556 --> 05:09.676
Yeah, well, clearly you've
never slept with me, honey.

05:12.185 --> 05:15.855
No, but really,
I have this gut feeling

05:15.856 --> 05:18.023
that Kevin picked this weekend

05:18.024 --> 05:22.570
and planned it all out
to propose to me.

05:22.571 --> 05:24.738
Sadie, I...

05:26.491 --> 05:28.534
You guys have been
together for, what,

05:28.535 --> 05:30.536
less than six months?

05:30.537 --> 05:32.246
You really think you
know him that well?

05:32.247 --> 05:36.876
Oh, I knew I wanted to marry
Kevin after our first date.

05:36.877 --> 05:40.129
He's the one.

05:40.130 --> 05:43.007
When you meet the
love of your life,

05:43.008 --> 05:46.802
you'll just know.

05:46.803 --> 05:50.890
I guess.

05:50.891 --> 05:54.018
Listen, Sadie, I really like Kevin.

05:54.019 --> 05:55.561
I do,

05:55.562 --> 05:58.647
but you guys fight an awful lot.

05:58.648 --> 06:00.649
I think...

06:00.650 --> 06:03.736
your mommy is jealous.

06:03.737 --> 06:06.363
I think you have a
massive crush on me,

06:06.364 --> 06:07.865
you want me to marry you,

06:07.866 --> 06:10.242
but unfortunately
neither of us are gay.

06:10.243 --> 06:12.453
Oh.

06:13.914 --> 06:17.249
Jen, you're my best friend.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.376
I love you so much.

06:19.377 --> 06:21.921
And if...

06:21.922 --> 06:25.257
when I get married...

06:25.258 --> 06:30.221
I want you to be my maid of honor.

I love that you're deep.

06:45.153 --> 06:46.904
So you don't love me for my mind?

06:46.905 --> 06:48.072
The crazy part, yeah.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.200
Well, you're in luck,

06:51.201 --> 06:54.411
'cause I feel like getting
crazy this weekend.

06:54.412 --> 06:56.205
Well, don't get too
crazy there, Sadie.

06:56.206 --> 06:58.040
I'll have to lock you
up in that prison.

06:58.041 --> 07:01.043
Ugh.
I hate passing that place.

07:01.044 --> 07:02.211
Always creeps me out.

- Christmas?

07:26.736 --> 07:29.530

not just for your money.

07:47.674 --> 07:50.467
Mostly for your gorgeous hair.

07:52.470 --> 07:54.555
Looks like a storm's rolling in.

07:54.556 --> 07:57.516
That's going to be so romantic.

07:57.517 --> 08:00.519
Oh, God.
You're going to get cancer.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.646
I don't inhale.

08:02.647 --> 08:06.525
Besides, they're not
as bad as cigarettes.

08:06.526 --> 08:09.194
These never bothered you when
we first started going out.

08:09.195 --> 08:10.821
You clearly haven't learned

08:10.822 --> 08:12.573
that girls put up
with a lot of things

08:12.574 --> 08:14.867
before they lock you in.

08:14.868 --> 08:16.493
I'm your girlfriend now.

08:16.494 --> 08:19.038
Things change, you know.

08:19.039 --> 08:21.373
I choose to defy you.

08:21.374 --> 08:24.251
Does that turn you on?

08:24.252 --> 08:26.545
No.

08:26.546 --> 08:28.380
But...

08:28.381 --> 08:33.217
this does.

08:33.219 --> 08:36.639
I have a feeling this is going
to be a whiskey weekend.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.099
You know what I mean?

08:39.100 --> 08:41.809
Capital idea.

08:41.811 --> 08:42.311
Mm-hmm.

08:50.779 --> 08:53.739
Now, I bet you...

08:53.740 --> 08:58.740
want to fuck me right now.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.750
Wait. You're right.

09:04.751 --> 09:07.044
You're going to have
to catch me first.

09:15.470 --> 09:15.970
Ow.

09:38.535 --> 09:40.786
Come on, old man.

09:40.787 --> 09:41.954
This is good for me,

09:41.955 --> 09:43.372
'cause I want to do
the Ironman next year...

09:43.373 --> 09:45.165
- Come on!
- ...and this kind of cardio

09:45.166 --> 09:47.292
is exactly what I need.

09:47.293 --> 09:52.293
Trying to kill me.

09:52.632 --> 09:53.799
Whoo!

09:53.800 --> 09:55.467
- All righty.
- I win.

09:55.468 --> 09:57.136
I guess since you won,

09:57.137 --> 09:58.554
you qualify for the victory swim.

09:58.555 --> 09:59.055
No!

10:23.997 --> 10:28.997
Come and get it!

10:29.461 --> 10:34.461
What's this?

10:38.428 --> 10:40.262
Kevin, do you love me?

10:40.263 --> 10:43.098
Of course I love you.

10:43.099 --> 10:44.600
Even though I'm crazy?

10:44.601 --> 10:48.187
I love you 'cause you're crazy.

11:04.287 --> 11:05.996
I think we should get out.

11:05.997 --> 11:07.623
No, no, I don't care.

11:07.624 --> 11:08.874
I don't care.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.542
If lightning strikes us right now,

11:10.543 --> 11:12.711
it'd be God's way of keeping
us together for eternity.

11:14.255 --> 11:15.756
Let's live a little longer,
shall we?

11:29.270 --> 11:30.604
You know what you get, don't you?

11:30.605 --> 11:32.147
What?

11:32.148 --> 11:33.732
What?

11:33.733 --> 11:34.942
What are you doing?

11:34.943 --> 11:37.361
- You're the winner.
- Oh, my God.

11:37.362 --> 11:41.865
On the behalf of the community,
we'd like to bestow this award upon you.

11:41.866 --> 11:43.659
You just came three minutes ago.

11:43.660 --> 11:45.744
Well, I'm not Superman.

11:45.745 --> 11:47.663
Yes, well, I am your Kryptonite,

11:47.664 --> 11:50.541
but I need to go dry our
messy, messy clothes.

11:50.542 --> 11:51.708
- Okay?
- Okay,

11:51.709 --> 11:54.920
- Leave me alone for five minutes.
- Yeah, all right. Fine.

11:54.921 --> 11:57.840
We'll be right out here.

12:44.554 --> 12:46.263
Kevin,

12:46.264 --> 12:49.391
tell me how much you love me again.

12:49.392 --> 12:51.727
Okay, I love you again.

12:51.728 --> 12:53.687
I'm serious.

12:53.688 --> 12:58.688
You know how much I love you.

12:59.527 --> 13:02.988
Do you think we're going
to grow old together?

13:02.989 --> 13:06.241
Sadie, you having a
girl moment right now?

13:06.242 --> 13:07.993
Is that what that is?

13:07.994 --> 13:09.536
Can you really be happy having sex

13:09.537 --> 13:11.496
with just one woman for
the rest of your life?

13:11.497 --> 13:13.999
As long as that one
woman was you, yeah.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.292
For the rest of your life?

13:15.293 --> 13:17.794
Starting today, the only pussy
you'll ever have is mine?

13:17.795 --> 13:22.795
As long as you're attached to it.

13:26.304 --> 13:28.972
So...

13:28.973 --> 13:30.849
you'll never cheat on me?

13:30.850 --> 13:33.644
Honey, you're too cute, all right?
Now cut it out, would you?

13:33.645 --> 13:35.479
Stop being so serious.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.022
Come over here and kiss me already.

13:37.023 --> 13:38.482
What's a fella got to do?

13:38.483 --> 13:41.610
Where are my cigarettes, honey?

13:41.611 --> 13:43.862
You give me so much grief
for smoking cigars,

13:43.863 --> 13:47.449
and you smoke that shit?

13:47.450 --> 13:49.826
You know how much I hate
that medication you take.

13:49.827 --> 13:51.703
We've had this argument.

13:51.704 --> 13:55.499
Yeah, I know, and for good reason.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.210
Psychs are paid by
pharmaceutical companies

13:58.211 --> 13:59.378
to prescribe that shit.

13:59.379 --> 14:04.379
It's a total scam.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.887
I think meds make
people more crazy.

14:08.888 --> 14:10.472
Some people need it.

14:10.473 --> 14:13.100
You've never been manic.
You don't understand.

14:13.101 --> 14:15.477
If you want me to get off my meds,

14:15.478 --> 14:17.854
get me pregnant.

14:17.855 --> 14:21.024
I'd stop taking 'em
if I was pregnant.

14:21.025 --> 14:23.360
I think we'd have to be
married first for that.

14:25.071 --> 14:30.071
Is that a proposal?

14:30.618 --> 14:35.618
I know what you want.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.459
I'm going to give you
what you really want.

14:39.460 --> 14:44.460
- All right.
- You're gonna love this, baby.

14:55.727 --> 14:56.893
You guys like it

14:56.894 --> 14:58.061
- when girls are angry...
- Ow.

14:58.062 --> 14:59.855
and pissed off when they're
giving you head, huh?

14:59.856 --> 15:01.481
- Really? Come on now.
- Yeah.

15:01.482 --> 15:03.150
That's how you like it.

15:03.151 --> 15:04.860
- You pervs like it like this.
- All right, that's...

15:04.861 --> 15:07.154
Ah, God!

15:07.155 --> 15:10.699
God! What the fuck?!
Ah, my eyes.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.701
God damn...
get me some water.

15:16.956 --> 15:19.956
No. No water.

15:29.635 --> 15:32.387
What the fuck happened
to my fucking head?

15:32.388 --> 15:35.849
You scorned me, Kevin.

15:35.850 --> 15:38.268
Oh, baby, I'm... I'm sorry.

15:38.269 --> 15:40.520
- You took my heart...
- I'm really sorry.

15:40.521 --> 15:43.815
and you...
you broke my heart.

15:43.816 --> 15:44.983
I'm sorry, baby.

15:44.984 --> 15:46.735
And you know how much
that was going to hurt me.

15:46.736 --> 15:48.862
Um...

15:48.863 --> 15:50.864
I knew.
I'm stupid.

15:50.865 --> 15:52.240
I'm really sorry.
I was just...

15:52.241 --> 15:53.784
You know what?
You know what?

15:55.703 --> 15:56.953
I love you.

15:56.954 --> 16:00.707
I love you.

16:00.708 --> 16:03.001
Do you know what I was going
to tell you this weekend?

16:03.002 --> 16:04.169
What?

16:04.170 --> 16:05.754
This weekend,
I was going to tell you

16:05.755 --> 16:08.632
that we're going to have a baby.

16:08.633 --> 16:11.301
I took a pregnancy test last week.

16:11.302 --> 16:15.138
I am growing an innocent little
baby right here in my tummy.

16:15.139 --> 16:16.932
And you know I could
never abort a baby.

16:16.933 --> 16:18.183
I could never harm an innocent life.

16:18.184 --> 16:19.768
- I'm going to be sick.
- You know that, right?

16:19.769 --> 16:22.521
- That's why I...
- All right.

16:22.522 --> 16:26.775
I stopped taking my lithium...
for you.

16:26.776 --> 16:28.401
- For you and the baby.
- I didn't know you were pregnant.

16:28.402 --> 16:31.029
That's right, 'cause you only cheat
on girls who aren't pregnant.

16:31.030 --> 16:33.031
That's right.
You are such an ethical man.

16:33.032 --> 16:35.200
I knew you had character, honey.

16:35.201 --> 16:38.203
I knew you had character.

16:38.204 --> 16:41.206
- Um...
- Go ahead, apologize.

16:41.207 --> 16:42.374
Tell me you're sorry.

16:42.375 --> 16:46.711
Tell me what a big fucking
mistake you made.

16:46.712 --> 16:49.131
I'm sorry.
That was a big mistake.

16:49.132 --> 16:52.717
Yes, it was.
But you know what?

16:52.718 --> 16:54.386
- I can fix it.
- Yeah.

16:54.387 --> 16:57.597
I sent Jennifer a text
message from your phone.

16:57.598 --> 16:59.891
You told her we broke up

16:59.892 --> 17:02.894
and I had a friend
come and pick me up

17:02.895 --> 17:05.646
and you have the house for
the rest of the weekend.

17:05.647 --> 17:07.858
And she was so excited about that.

17:09.068 --> 17:10.527
Oh. Hold on.

17:10.528 --> 17:12.487
Hold on.
You just got a message.

17:12.488 --> 17:13.696
It's from Jennifer.

17:13.698 --> 17:15.824
I'll read it to you word for word.

17:15.825 --> 17:19.411
"I can leave tonight after work."

17:19.412 --> 17:22.289
Then she wrote an X and an O

17:22.290 --> 17:24.624
and an X and an O, etcetera.

17:24.625 --> 17:27.252
Those are hugs and kisses.
I think she really likes you, honey.

17:27.252 --> 17:31.047
I really do.

17:31.048 --> 17:33.800
Oh. Another message from Jennifer.

17:33.801 --> 17:36.052
- "I can't wait to see you, Kevin."
- Come on.

17:36.053 --> 17:39.764
"PS, I'm going 2 B wearing
something extra naughty."

17:39.765 --> 17:43.185
Whoo! My goodness.
You two are frisky.

17:43.186 --> 17:45.103
You promised me a weekend.

17:45.104 --> 17:47.063
We're just going to
have a friend join us.

17:47.064 --> 17:50.734
Remember that time when you asked me
if I would be willing to do a threesome?

17:50.735 --> 17:53.486
That's the thing about
threesomes, of course.

17:53.487 --> 17:56.323
You got to do it all together.
You can't do it separately.

17:56.324 --> 17:58.617
- Fuck!
- Ooh.

17:58.618 --> 18:00.744
I got to learn how to tie
ropes a little better.

18:00.745 --> 18:02.454
- You fucking...
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

18:02.455 --> 18:04.331
Okay. You know what?
You know what?

18:04.332 --> 18:05.540
Come here. Come here.

18:05.541 --> 18:07.751
You're going to take this
whole damn bottle right now.

18:07.752 --> 18:09.461
Right now.

18:09.462 --> 18:11.671
Okay. Okay.

18:14.592 --> 18:16.301
Fuck!

18:16.302 --> 18:17.636
Oh, my fucking head.

18:17.637 --> 18:19.596
- Oh, my fucking head.
- Yeah.

18:19.597 --> 18:24.597
I'm about to bash your head in
again if you don't calm down.

18:25.436 --> 18:28.605
Okay. Oh.

18:28.606 --> 18:30.732
Okay.

18:30.733 --> 18:32.525
It's okay.

18:32.526 --> 18:36.321
It's okay.

18:36.322 --> 18:40.533
I really think I should get
you a cigar or something.

18:44.413 --> 18:44.454
He loves me.

18:44.455 --> 18:46.957
He loves me.

18:46.958 --> 18:50.502
He loves me not.

18:50.503 --> 18:53.421
He loves me.

18:53.422 --> 18:57.550
He loves me not.

18:57.551 --> 19:00.262
He loves me.

19:00.263 --> 19:05.263
He loves me not.
Honey, this is going to be so romantic.

19:07.228 --> 19:08.395
Ooh.

19:08.396 --> 19:09.896
Now, honey,
you shouldn't be drinking.

19:09.897 --> 19:12.607
Just...

19:12.608 --> 19:13.817
it's not good for you.

19:13.818 --> 19:16.820
You shouldn't be drinking, smoking.

19:16.821 --> 19:18.780
There's a baby in you now.

19:18.781 --> 19:20.865
Baby, my mama drank and smoked

19:20.866 --> 19:25.662
all through my pregnancy,
and I turned out all right.

19:25.663 --> 19:26.830
Want some more Vicodin?

19:26.831 --> 19:28.498
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.127
Here's one right here for later
and one right here for now.

19:32.128 --> 19:34.713
Hey, no! Ow.

19:34.714 --> 19:36.506
There we go.
That's better.

19:36.507 --> 19:38.758
Please, you got to stop.

19:38.759 --> 19:41.803
You need to stop asking me that.

19:41.804 --> 19:43.555
Look at how supportive I'm being.

19:43.556 --> 19:47.642
I set up the candles.
I got the flower petals here.

19:47.643 --> 19:49.853
I swear to God, you men never
appreciate anything women do for you.

19:49.854 --> 19:52.272
He loves me.

19:52.273 --> 19:54.399
He loves me not.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.568
He loves me.
He loves me not.

19:56.569 --> 19:58.570
I certainly hope
I end on "He loves me"!

19:58.571 --> 19:59.071
Me too.

20:16.088 --> 20:19.591
"Follow the rose petals."

20:19.592 --> 20:21.092
Hmm.

20:21.093 --> 20:26.093
"Follow the rose petals," Bootsie.

20:42.531 --> 20:46.493
Go to sleep here, little Bootsie.

20:49.372 --> 20:53.833
Mama's got a hot date.

20:53.834 --> 20:57.962
Don't mind if I do.

21:04.678 --> 21:09.678
"Take your clothes off."

21:18.484 --> 21:20.318
"Come in on your hands n knees"?

21:21.862 --> 21:22.362
Shit.

21:26.992 --> 21:27.492
Baby?

21:30.996 --> 21:35.996
Your naughty little puppy is here.

21:52.226 --> 21:54.936
Hello, sexy.

21:54.937 --> 21:57.397
Mmm.

21:57.398 --> 21:59.566
Take the gag off.

22:01.277 --> 22:03.194
Take the gag off.

22:03.195 --> 22:06.195
No.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.785
Take the gag off of me.

22:10.786 --> 22:13.455
Kevin, you're such a freak.

22:16.876 --> 22:18.376
Don't use the handcuffs.

22:18.377 --> 22:19.836
You don't need to
use the handcuffs.

22:21.255 --> 22:22.797
Bad dog.

22:27.303 --> 22:29.304
You're a cheater, Jennifer,

22:29.305 --> 22:30.889
just like Kevin.

22:30.890 --> 22:33.892
Sadie, this is crazy.

22:33.893 --> 22:35.643
Yeah, it is.

22:35.644 --> 22:37.604
We were friends.

22:37.605 --> 22:39.731
You were going to be my fricking
maid of honor, for Christ's sake.

22:39.732 --> 22:41.232
I know.

22:41.233 --> 22:45.320
I know, but we can talk
about this, right?

22:45.321 --> 22:48.698
No.

22:48.699 --> 22:50.617
I'm really sorry, Sadie.

22:50.618 --> 22:54.204
I know how this must look.

22:54.205 --> 22:59.205
Sadie, there's something
important you need to know.

23:02.546 --> 23:05.173
I'm sure there is,

23:05.174 --> 23:08.593
but I don't want to hear
anything from you right now.

23:08.594 --> 23:11.638
Kevin likes his women clean.

23:11.639 --> 23:14.682
Don't you, Kevin?

23:14.683 --> 23:19.270
Oh, I prescribed him some medicine.
He probably passed out again.

23:19.271 --> 23:24.271
Sadie, what are you doing?

23:26.111 --> 23:27.487
Hey! Hey!

23:27.488 --> 23:28.863
Hey! Hey!

23:28.864 --> 23:31.282
Come here.

23:31.283 --> 23:35.537
You know what they used to do
to cheaters in the medieval days?

23:35.538 --> 23:37.789
For one, they used
to cut off their hair.

23:37.790 --> 23:39.749
- No. No.
- You hold still,

23:39.750 --> 23:41.251
or I'll pop your fucking eye out.

23:41.252 --> 23:46.252
- Please don't.
- I have to.

23:58.143 --> 23:59.394
Please stop.

24:02.523 --> 24:06.276
Sadie.

24:06.277 --> 24:10.154
I want to explain everything to you.

24:10.155 --> 24:14.155
It should have been you
in that hospital, not me.

24:19.707 --> 24:22.707
Please.

24:25.004 --> 24:28.965
Jen, you look so beautiful.

24:28.966 --> 24:31.966
Kevin, she's all ready for you.

24:37.099 --> 24:39.017
Isn't she pretty, Kevin?

24:39.018 --> 24:41.603
You got to let us go.
This is...

24:41.604 --> 24:42.895
this is crazy.

24:42.896 --> 24:45.231
As crazy as you two
loving behind my back?

24:46.692 --> 24:49.694
I'm trying to make you feel better.

24:49.695 --> 24:52.280
No more guilt, no hiding.

24:52.281 --> 24:54.407
I'm going to watch.

24:54.408 --> 24:57.702
That way, neither of you are doing
anything behind my back anymore.

24:57.703 --> 24:59.704
It's all out in the open,

24:59.705 --> 25:02.707
no lies, no deceit.

25:02.708 --> 25:05.710
Don't you two feel cleaner now?

25:05.711 --> 25:08.588
Sadie, we don't want to do this.

25:08.589 --> 25:11.591
You don't have a say in this, Jen.

25:11.592 --> 25:14.344
Did I have a say when you started

25:14.345 --> 25:18.139
loving my boyfriend behind my back?

25:18.140 --> 25:21.684
You are a...

25:21.685 --> 25:22.852
skanky whore.

25:27.983 --> 25:29.734
Look, look, are you okay?

25:29.735 --> 25:33.321
I'm...

25:56.595 --> 25:59.806
Jennifer...

25:59.807 --> 26:03.768
you know I love Bootsie.

26:03.769 --> 26:05.937
Oh, my God.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.150
You two remember
that woman who tried

26:11.151 --> 26:12.671
to dry off her poodle
in the microwave?

26:13.946 --> 26:15.947
She should have read the instructions,
but women never do.

26:15.948 --> 26:17.615
For Christ's sake, Sadie,
this is a little dog.

26:17.616 --> 26:18.783
You can't do this.

26:18.784 --> 26:20.243
I think 10 minutes should suffice.

26:20.244 --> 26:21.869
Just cut the bullshit.

26:21.870 --> 26:25.289
You two...

26:25.290 --> 26:27.709
you two started the bullshit.

26:27.710 --> 26:30.086
Now, what I want you to do

26:30.087 --> 26:32.380
is oral her

26:32.381 --> 26:34.257
right now,

26:34.258 --> 26:37.009
or I will start this microwave,

26:37.010 --> 26:41.681
and her little doggy will
cook from the inside out.

26:44.518 --> 26:45.768
Three...

26:45.769 --> 26:47.979
two, one.

26:47.980 --> 26:49.355
Okay, okay. We'll do it.

26:49.356 --> 26:52.400
Just don't hurt the puppy.

26:55.446 --> 26:57.655
Eat her pussy.

26:57.656 --> 26:58.990
Do it now.

26:58.991 --> 27:03.991
It's okay, Kevin.
Just do it.

27:08.333 --> 27:12.795
She taste as good as I do?

27:12.796 --> 27:17.550
You better answer no.

27:17.551 --> 27:22.551
Be nice to have some
music right about now.

27:22.848 --> 27:25.308

bit closer, baby ♪</i>

27:25.309 --> 27:30.309

27:37.070 --> 27:39.530

Sex always makes me hungry.

28:13.774 --> 28:16.108
Don't pass out on me, Kevin.

28:16.109 --> 28:19.487
Oh, God, now I have to go easier
on those drugs I'm giving you.

28:19.488 --> 28:22.824
I just love eating outside.
I'm so glad it stopped raining.

28:22.825 --> 28:25.827
Watery tacos get all
mushy and nasty.

28:25.828 --> 28:27.328
Here you go, honey.

28:27.329 --> 28:32.329
Why don't you have some?
Eat it!

28:34.586 --> 28:37.380
Well, neither of you told
me how good my food is.

28:37.381 --> 28:40.758
I'm practically an expert
at making tacos.

28:40.759 --> 28:43.302
- How many times I made you tacos?
- A lot.

28:43.303 --> 28:45.054
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

28:45.055 --> 28:47.682
I'm pretty sure these are my best.

28:47.683 --> 28:50.351
You like 'em, Jennifer?

28:50.352 --> 28:54.105
Mm-hmm.

28:54.106 --> 28:55.857
Well, speak up, honey.
I can't hear you.

28:55.858 --> 28:57.608
I said yes.

28:57.609 --> 28:59.944
These tacos are good.
Okay, Sadie?

28:59.945 --> 29:01.112
You goddamn psycho!

29:01.113 --> 29:02.780
- Shh.
- Can you hear me now?!

29:02.781 --> 29:04.866
Your tacos are fucking great,

29:04.867 --> 29:06.868
you crazy, fucking bitch.

29:06.869 --> 29:08.202
Did you understand that?

29:08.203 --> 29:10.705
You need to relax.

29:10.706 --> 29:13.583
I'll relax when you stop
this shit and let us go.

29:13.584 --> 29:15.877
And can I have my fucking
clothes back, please?

29:15.878 --> 29:17.044
Shh. No, no, no.

29:17.045 --> 29:19.213
- What the fuck are you doing, Kevin?
- Don't make her angry.

29:19.214 --> 29:20.381
What the fuck is wrong with you?

29:20.382 --> 29:21.591
- Listen.
- Huh?

29:21.592 --> 29:23.259
Don't piss her off.
It's a fucking game.

29:23.260 --> 29:24.969
All right, calm down.
Let's just enjoy a nice dinner.

29:24.970 --> 29:27.263
Let's get back to the tacos.

29:27.264 --> 29:30.308
You know, I use a lot of spices.
I make 'em real spicy.

29:30.309 --> 29:32.310
If you use a meat
that's not the best,

29:32.311 --> 29:36.147
covers it up real well.

29:36.148 --> 29:37.982
You want some more
guacamole on your tacos?

29:37.983 --> 29:39.400
No. I'm fine.

29:39.401 --> 29:40.902
Here we go.
Come here.

29:40.903 --> 29:44.155
I love guacamole.

29:44.156 --> 29:45.990
Sadie, this is fucked up.

29:45.991 --> 29:49.119
Eat it.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.080
Right.

29:53.081 --> 29:54.582
You know what I was just thinking?

29:54.583 --> 29:57.251
I should start a taco stand.

29:57.252 --> 29:59.378
That's what I should do.

29:59.379 --> 30:00.922
I'd have to think of a
real good name for it,

30:00.923 --> 30:04.592
something catchy.

30:04.593 --> 30:09.055
Bootsie's Taco Stand.

30:09.056 --> 30:11.641
By the way, Jennifer,
have you seen Bootsie?

30:11.642 --> 30:14.518
I haven't seen that little doggy
since I started making dinner.

30:14.519 --> 30:16.687
Bootsie!

30:16.688 --> 30:18.397
Bootsie.

30:18.398 --> 30:20.942
Where are you, little doggy?

30:20.943 --> 30:22.818
Bootsie.

30:22.819 --> 30:26.781
Bootsie, where are you, honey?

30:30.661 --> 30:32.828
Oh, there he is.

30:32.829 --> 30:34.705
Come here, doggy.

30:34.706 --> 30:36.958
There's the little guy.

30:36.959 --> 30:40.378
Mwah.

30:40.379 --> 30:41.712
Oh.

30:41.713 --> 30:44.674
Did you guys spit out your food?

30:44.675 --> 30:46.968
I spent an awful lot of time
working on this dinner

30:46.969 --> 30:51.969
for you guys to spit it out.

30:53.225 --> 30:58.225
Aw, now, how could you think
I'd cook up little Bootsie here?

30:58.230 --> 30:59.397
Huh?

30:59.398 --> 31:01.357
I'm not some kind of animal.

31:03.402 --> 31:06.612
How fucking long is this
going to go on, okay?

31:06.613 --> 31:11.534
As long as it needs to.

31:11.535 --> 31:15.371
I told you, Kevin, you scorned me.

31:15.372 --> 31:18.708
You too, Jen.

31:18.709 --> 31:21.168
This little dog,
on the other hand,

31:21.169 --> 31:24.130
didn't do nothing to me.

31:24.131 --> 31:26.298
He's a good puppy.

31:26.299 --> 31:28.009
There you go.

31:28.010 --> 31:33.010
There you go. Oh.

31:36.101 --> 31:38.978
All units be advised,
we had an escape

31:38.979 --> 31:41.105
from the correctional
facility in Logan County.

31:41.106 --> 31:44.859
Suspect believed to be dangerous,
heading north.

31:48.071 --> 31:49.739
Five on the way.

31:49.740 --> 31:52.450
Dispatch, we've got
no sign of escapee,

31:52.451 --> 31:55.286
and we've covered two
miles south of 105.

32:14.097 --> 32:15.431
Now wake up, Kevin.

32:15.432 --> 32:17.725
I want both of you to hear this.

32:17.726 --> 32:21.562
Look what I found.

32:21.563 --> 32:26.563
All kinds of stuff in this house.

32:30.822 --> 32:35.822
Going to tell you guys a story
about when I was in the hospital.

32:37.662 --> 32:40.081
They thought I was sick.

32:40.082 --> 32:44.085
They wanted to cure me.

32:44.086 --> 32:47.588
They explained to me that...

32:47.589 --> 32:49.799
to change one's behavior,

32:49.800 --> 32:53.719
you must change their
thinking pattern first.

32:55.555 --> 32:58.474
They said that...

32:58.475 --> 33:01.727
electricity was good for that.

33:01.728 --> 33:03.854
They said it would cure me.

33:03.855 --> 33:06.232
I don't know about that.

33:06.233 --> 33:09.360
After their shocks, I'd just...

33:09.361 --> 33:13.489
get so mad.

33:13.490 --> 33:16.742
Mostly I'd just stare
out the window,

33:16.743 --> 33:21.163
sometimes for hours.

33:21.164 --> 33:24.750
If I really misbehaved,
they'd take me into this room,

33:24.751 --> 33:28.087
and they'd give me shock
after shock after shock.

33:28.088 --> 33:33.088
There was a certain point,
I guess I just stopped misbehaving.

33:33.718 --> 33:35.219
I don't know if I was cured,

33:35.220 --> 33:37.972
but I certainly didn't
feel like doing the things

33:37.973 --> 33:42.973
that made 'em give me the shocks.

33:43.103 --> 33:46.564
You two have misbehaved.

33:47.732 --> 33:50.901
You need to be cured of
wanting to fuck each other.

33:50.902 --> 33:52.695
All you need is...

33:52.696 --> 33:53.863
a little electricity.

33:53.864 --> 33:56.949
Oh, shit.

33:56.950 --> 34:00.202
I forgot.

34:00.203 --> 34:05.203
Could bite your tongue clean off
if you don't have protection.

34:05.750 --> 34:07.877
Sadie, please let us go.

34:07.878 --> 34:09.670
Shh now.

34:09.670 --> 34:11.755
Shh!

34:11.755 --> 34:13.507
It's all right.

34:13.507 --> 34:16.302
Come on, you just...

34:16.303 --> 34:17.636
please, you don't need to...

34:17.637 --> 34:18.804
- Shh.
- Come on.

34:18.804 --> 34:21.264
Okay.

34:21.266 --> 34:24.476
What's that?

34:24.476 --> 34:27.605
Oh, baby, you got a text.

34:27.606 --> 34:30.107
It's from your mother.

34:30.108 --> 34:32.775
Awful timing.

34:32.777 --> 34:36.739
She's asking how we're enjoying
our weekend at the house.

34:36.739 --> 34:38.949
I will respond for you.

34:38.949 --> 34:43.579
"Sadie n I are having
an awesome time.

34:43.580 --> 34:45.789
By the way,

34:45.790 --> 34:48.958
are u still sucking Dad's dick?"

34:50.962 --> 34:53.005
I put a little happy face.

34:53.005 --> 34:55.090
Oh, Kevin, honey, come on.

34:55.091 --> 34:57.092
You never did have
a sense of humor.

35:22.953 --> 35:25.120
You fucking cunt!

35:25.121 --> 35:27.998
You did all this because of
a fucking stupid affair?

35:27.999 --> 35:29.166
It was nothing!

35:32.504 --> 35:35.673
Jesus, Kevin, you're so hostile.

35:35.674 --> 35:37.132
I'm just trying to help you.

35:37.133 --> 35:39.843
Think of me as your doctor.

35:39.844 --> 35:41.971
Oh, honey...

35:41.972 --> 35:43.514
you peed your pants.

35:43.515 --> 35:44.974
It's okay.
It happens.

35:44.975 --> 35:46.433
Well, how do you feel, Kevin?

35:46.434 --> 35:49.019
Do you feel like sticking your
dick into Jennifer anymore?

35:49.020 --> 35:50.187
Let us go.

35:50.188 --> 35:52.273
Oh, sure, yeah, honey.
I'll get right on that.

35:52.274 --> 35:55.859
Would you like me to call
911 too while I'm at it?

35:55.860 --> 35:59.321
I was in the hospital till I was 18.

35:59.322 --> 36:01.365
I think you two are
getting off pretty easy.

36:01.366 --> 36:03.367
Hasn't this gone on
for long enough?

36:03.368 --> 36:08.368
What more are you
going to do to us?

36:08.456 --> 36:09.832
I don't know, Jennifer.

36:09.833 --> 36:12.209
I'm a girl.

36:12.210 --> 36:17.210
I don't read the instructions.
I'm just kind of winging it here.

36:17.716 --> 36:19.717
Ugh.

36:19.718 --> 36:20.884
What the hell?

36:20.885 --> 36:22.720
How do you fucking smoke
these things, baby?

36:22.721 --> 36:24.096
They taste like shit.

36:25.890 --> 36:27.641
Jeez.
Who the fuck is that?

36:29.436 --> 36:33.897
Help! Help!
We're out here by the...

36:33.898 --> 36:35.190
You two don't go anywhere.

36:35.191 --> 36:36.525
Have a cigar.

36:37.861 --> 36:40.529
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

36:50.749 --> 36:51.957
Hi there.

36:51.958 --> 36:53.459
Is Kevin here?

36:53.460 --> 36:56.879
I mean, I saw his car.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.631
Yes. Actually, he...

36:59.632 --> 37:01.425
is in the shower.

37:01.426 --> 37:03.344
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

37:03.345 --> 37:05.179
I live next door.
I'm Rita.

37:05.180 --> 37:07.348
I'm Sadie.

37:07.349 --> 37:08.849
Nice to meet you.

37:08.850 --> 37:10.601
- I'm Kevin's girlfriend.
- Oh.

37:10.602 --> 37:12.770
Actually, his fiancee.

37:12.771 --> 37:14.146
It's a secret.

37:14.147 --> 37:15.814
Shh. Don't tell anyone.

37:15.815 --> 37:17.941
Dear, I don't want
to bother you two.

37:17.942 --> 37:20.069
I just want to leave
some of my chili.

37:20.070 --> 37:23.947
It's been Kevin's favorite
since he was a kid.

37:23.948 --> 37:26.325
- Has it, now?
- Yeah.

37:26.326 --> 37:29.620
Well, how did you know
that chili is my favorite?

37:31.289 --> 37:32.748
Kevin!

37:32.749 --> 37:35.793
Rita just came over and
brought us some chili!

37:35.794 --> 37:38.087
Why don't you come in
and have some with us?

37:38.088 --> 37:41.423
Oh, dear, I've already
butted in too much already.

37:41.424 --> 37:46.424
No, no, no.
Rita, I insist.

37:48.598 --> 37:50.891
Bootsie!

37:50.892 --> 37:52.142
Bootsie!

37:52.143 --> 37:57.143
- Oh.
- Bootsie!

37:58.900 --> 38:01.193
All units, suspect last seen

38:01.194 --> 38:05.614
heading north of 415
toward Hilltop Road.

38:05.615 --> 38:06.824
That's a copy, dispatch.

38:06.825 --> 38:08.826
We've got units covering
the whole county.

38:08.827 --> 38:11.078
We've also got the state
police assisting.

38:25.009 --> 38:28.220
Why do dogs like to find
the muddiest puddles?

38:28.221 --> 38:33.221
I swear they're just like men.

38:38.189 --> 38:40.274
Oh, I don't know what
I would have done

38:40.275 --> 38:42.109
if Bootsie got away.

38:42.110 --> 38:43.694
He's never been to this house.

38:43.695 --> 38:45.863
Oh.

38:45.864 --> 38:50.864
You run along now.

39:01.379 --> 39:03.714
I have a gun in my bedside table.

39:03.715 --> 39:04.965
I'm swing to go get it.

39:04.966 --> 39:06.675
Meant nothing?

39:06.676 --> 39:07.843
Baby...

39:07.844 --> 39:11.346
Just shut up and get the gun.

39:11.347 --> 39:13.599
I love onions in my chili.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.894
Won't you please stay
and have some with us?

39:16.895 --> 39:19.855
Listen, dear, I still
remember what it was like

39:19.856 --> 39:22.274
when I was a young girl.

39:22.275 --> 39:26.236
You two don't need an old
coot like me around.

39:26.237 --> 39:27.821
Tell Kevin I said hi.

39:27.822 --> 39:30.822
Mm.

39:44.172 --> 39:45.380
Looking for this?

39:45.381 --> 39:46.924
All right, just...

39:46.925 --> 39:49.760
Honey, you told me the gun
was in the drawer, remember?

39:49.761 --> 39:51.929
Just put the fucking gun
down, okay?

39:51.930 --> 39:53.639
- This has gone far enough.
- No, it hasn't.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.350
Just come on!
Just stop it!

39:56.351 --> 40:01.351
Kevin, get back downstairs.

40:20.833 --> 40:23.919
Cumbersome motherfucker.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.420
Damn.

40:25.421 --> 40:28.674
I'll never see him again.

40:28.675 --> 40:31.718
I promise you that, Sadie.

40:31.719 --> 40:36.719
I have to teach you
to try not to escape.

40:37.767 --> 40:40.102
No.

40:40.103 --> 40:43.105
For God's sake...

40:43.106 --> 40:45.190
Don't you know there is no God?

40:45.191 --> 40:46.900
Or else why would he
let me do this to you?

40:46.901 --> 40:48.235
No, please.

40:48.236 --> 40:49.653
- Hey!
- Don't.

40:49.654 --> 40:51.363
- Hey!
- No. No.

40:51.364 --> 40:53.824
- Please!
- Don't fight it, cheater.

40:53.825 --> 40:56.118
I have to punish you
so that you learn

40:56.119 --> 41:01.119
not to loosen your
fingers like Kevin did.

41:01.583 --> 41:03.292
Come on, Sadie, look at me.

41:03.293 --> 41:05.544
It's me, Jen,

41:05.545 --> 41:08.338
your best friend
since second grade.

41:08.339 --> 41:12.384
I've learned my lesson,
I swear to God.

41:12.385 --> 41:14.052
I told you.

41:14.053 --> 41:16.221
There is no God.

41:16.222 --> 41:19.349
That's why I have to do this to you.

41:19.350 --> 41:21.810
You've lost your mind.

41:21.811 --> 41:26.811
I don't see you in you anymore.

41:28.610 --> 41:32.404
I don't know you.

41:32.405 --> 41:37.200
You know, you're right, Jen.

41:37.201 --> 41:42.201
Yeah, we're friends.

41:42.415 --> 41:43.874
We were friends!

41:54.093 --> 41:56.094
Ah, no.

43:24.976 --> 43:27.394
How can you fucking do that to her?

43:27.395 --> 43:29.312
Did you want to say something?

43:29.313 --> 43:32.816
How can you do that to her?

43:32.817 --> 43:35.318
Well, she's passed out now.
She doesn't feel anything.

43:35.319 --> 43:39.656
You seem awfully protective of her.

43:39.657 --> 43:41.074
I'm going to fucking kill you.

43:41.075 --> 43:44.494
That's no way to talk to
the mother of your child.

43:44.495 --> 43:48.999
No, I'm going to see to it
that you don't run away again.

43:50.585 --> 43:54.379
Do you remember our
favorite movie, baby?

43:54.380 --> 43:56.047
You got it on DVD.

43:56.048 --> 43:59.801
Oh, we saw a lot of movies, Sadie.

43:59.802 --> 44:04.802
Oh, I think it'll come to you.

44:05.683 --> 44:10.683
Kathy Bates was very good in it.

44:15.610 --> 44:19.530
"Misery."

44:20.531 --> 44:25.327
What's the scene that
everybody remembers?

44:25.328 --> 44:26.828
No.

44:26.829 --> 44:29.247
You... you can't do that.

44:29.248 --> 44:32.250
- It just creeped everybody out.
- No.

44:32.251 --> 44:34.961
I think they called it hobbling.

44:34.962 --> 44:36.755
No.

44:36.756 --> 44:38.757
Okay.

44:38.758 --> 44:40.550
You can't do this.

44:40.551 --> 44:42.594
What I can't do

44:42.595 --> 44:45.180
is have my man

44:45.181 --> 44:47.140
try to run away from me again.

44:47.141 --> 44:50.852
That's what I can't do.

44:50.853 --> 44:52.229
- No.
- I'm sorry, honey.

44:52.230 --> 44:54.564
This is... this is going to hurt.

44:54.565 --> 44:56.066
You're not going to...

44:56.067 --> 44:58.902
I'm sorry.

45:00.446 --> 45:02.072
Fuck!

45:07.328 --> 45:09.788
- Jesus, fuck.
- Oh!

45:09.789 --> 45:10.956
I'm sorry, baby.

45:10.957 --> 45:13.458
I'm sorry, Kevin.

45:13.459 --> 45:16.211
I don't think I could
break the other one.

45:16.212 --> 45:20.715
How the hell did she break
both of them in the movie?

45:20.716 --> 45:22.259
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

45:49.287 --> 45:50.453
Hey.

45:50.454 --> 45:55.454
Been asleep for almost an hour.

45:59.797 --> 46:01.506
Where is Kevin?

46:01.507 --> 46:03.300
He's upstairs.

46:03.301 --> 46:07.470
I felt really, really bad
after I crushed his ankle.

46:07.471 --> 46:09.848
I wrapped it and gave
him some Vicodin.

46:09.849 --> 46:11.391
He's totally knocked out.

46:13.561 --> 46:15.854
Will you please let me go?

46:15.855 --> 46:18.064
No.

46:18.065 --> 46:20.191
You should take some of these.

46:20.192 --> 46:23.028
I don't want to.

46:23.029 --> 46:27.032
The pain in my hand
is just numb now.

46:27.033 --> 46:29.367
Not for your hand.

46:29.368 --> 46:33.371
Trust me.
You're going to want 'em.

46:33.372 --> 46:35.373
Here. Here.

46:35.374 --> 46:36.875
Drink, drink, drink.

46:43.257 --> 46:45.884
When does this finish?

46:45.885 --> 46:49.554
When I'm finished.

46:49.555 --> 46:51.765
Did I...

46:51.766 --> 46:55.602
ever tell you the story
about when my sister

46:55.603 --> 46:59.439
took my little puppy's
love away from me?

46:59.440 --> 47:03.526
What are you talking about?

47:03.527 --> 47:07.238
I had just turned 11.

47:07.239 --> 47:12.239
My dad bought me the
cutest little puppy.

47:14.246 --> 47:16.539
My little sister

47:16.540 --> 47:19.209
played with it...

47:19.210 --> 47:22.671
and pet it...

47:22.672 --> 47:27.467
until that little puppy started to
love her more than it loved me.

47:27.468 --> 47:30.512
Maybe it didn't love her more.

47:30.513 --> 47:32.097
Maybe you just thought that.

47:32.098 --> 47:35.350
That's not true.

47:35.351 --> 47:36.810
One night, I went in her room,

47:36.811 --> 47:41.811
and that little puppy was sleeping,
curled up on her bed.

47:42.775 --> 47:45.944
I told you I killed that puppy.

47:45.945 --> 47:49.823
- That's why you went to the hospital.
- No.

47:49.824 --> 47:52.784
I didn't kill the puppy.

47:52.785 --> 47:55.412
You didn't?

47:55.413 --> 47:57.706
No.

47:57.707 --> 48:00.458
See, I couldn't blame
my little puppy.

48:00.459 --> 48:02.335
It wasn't his fault.

48:02.336 --> 48:06.923
He didn't know no better.

48:06.924 --> 48:10.260
It was my sister's fault.

48:10.261 --> 48:12.470
So the next day,

48:12.471 --> 48:17.471
she had a little
accident in the pool.

48:19.812 --> 48:21.688
I helped her drown.

48:21.689 --> 48:24.232
You told me you tried to save her.

48:24.233 --> 48:27.652
I told everyone that.

48:27.653 --> 48:32.653
It wasn't true, Jen.

48:35.536 --> 48:39.039
What I didn't tell you is that
the police didn't believe me.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.582
I was too young to go to jail,

48:40.583 --> 48:45.583
so, you know, they could
only keep me till I was 18.

48:45.588 --> 48:50.467
Listen, I've been thinking...

48:50.468 --> 48:55.468
Kevin is a lot like
my little puppy was.

48:56.140 --> 48:58.349
I can't really blame him,
you know?

48:58.350 --> 49:01.311
You and me, we always said
that men are like dogs.

49:01.312 --> 49:03.396
Someone just smiles at 'em,

49:03.397 --> 49:08.026
they'll jump up and
sleep in their bed.

49:08.027 --> 49:11.071
You...

49:11.072 --> 49:16.072
are beautiful, Jennifer.

49:17.745 --> 49:22.745
You have the most beautiful smile.

49:32.009 --> 49:36.221
Maybe if my sister...

49:36.222 --> 49:40.725
wasn't so pretty, my little puppy
would have stayed with me.

49:40.726 --> 49:43.728
You're beautiful, Sadie.

49:43.729 --> 49:45.522
Not as pretty a smile as Jennifer.

49:45.523 --> 49:46.940
That's not true.

49:46.941 --> 49:50.193
When we're at bars, guys always
want your number first.

49:50.194 --> 49:53.905
Let's not beat around the bush.

49:53.906 --> 49:56.116
Your dad's a dentist.

49:56.117 --> 49:57.408
Your teeth are perfect.

49:57.409 --> 49:59.869
I'm just going to chip one of 'em.

49:59.870 --> 50:01.121
What?

50:02.790 --> 50:05.083
Yeah. It'll work better
if you hold still.

50:05.084 --> 50:06.251
Hey!

50:06.252 --> 50:08.169
Hold still.
It'll go easier.

50:08.170 --> 50:09.712
Just stop struggling.

50:09.713 --> 50:11.506
I'm not going to
pull out your tooth.

50:11.507 --> 50:14.008
I'm just going to chip it.

50:19.181 --> 50:21.683
You do have nice teeth.

50:21.684 --> 50:26.684
Sorry, I must have
nicked your gums.

50:28.983 --> 50:32.527
I guess you're kind of pissed,
aren't you?

51:37.843 --> 51:42.013
Green tea's ready.

51:42.014 --> 51:46.643
Just don't forget the lemon!

51:47.937 --> 51:51.147
Two sugars, right?

51:51.148 --> 51:54.108
Oh! Bootsie.

51:54.109 --> 51:55.735
Oh, honey.

51:55.736 --> 51:57.403
Have you not had dinner yet?

51:57.404 --> 51:59.280
I'm so sorry.

51:59.281 --> 52:04.281
Here, have some chili.

52:05.204 --> 52:07.163
Oh, and, Kevin,

52:07.164 --> 52:12.164
you're going to love the little
polka-dotted dress I got for you.

52:22.221 --> 52:24.889
Didn't have any lemon,
so I had to use...

52:24.890 --> 52:28.851
lemon juice.

52:30.980 --> 52:35.980
Kevin, you look so pathetic.

52:38.862 --> 52:40.530
There, silly Willy.

52:40.531 --> 52:45.531
All yours.

52:49.540 --> 52:53.918
Kevin, you're never
getting out of here.

52:53.919 --> 52:58.919
You're all mine.

53:01.927 --> 53:04.137
Hmm.

53:04.138 --> 53:07.390
Do you like my dress?

53:07.391 --> 53:09.309
You think it's pretty on me?

53:09.310 --> 53:12.770
I brought it up here to
surprise you this weekend.

53:12.771 --> 53:17.525
Now I want you to take a good look.

53:17.526 --> 53:22.526
Get this picture of my
sexy panties in your mind.

53:34.877 --> 53:36.461
What are you going to do with that?

53:36.462 --> 53:41.462
Baby, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

53:42.092 --> 53:45.553
It wasn't your fault.

53:45.554 --> 53:48.473
You know, you cheating
on me with Jennifer.

53:48.474 --> 53:51.684
She was cute and sexy.

53:51.685 --> 53:54.479
And once you laid your eyes on her,

53:54.480 --> 53:58.191
it was impossible
for you to resist.

53:58.192 --> 54:00.526
But I have a way

54:00.527 --> 54:04.155
to make that never
happen for us again.

54:04.156 --> 54:07.283
You have wandering eyes, Kevin,

54:07.284 --> 54:11.162
and that's not good for
our relationship, baby.

54:11.163 --> 54:13.164
Haven't you done enough?

54:13.165 --> 54:14.791
All right? Come on.
I learned my lesson.

54:14.792 --> 54:15.958
Just please don't.

54:15.959 --> 54:18.503
I gave you the image
of the sexy underwear.

54:18.504 --> 54:20.171
Don't take my eyes.

54:20.172 --> 54:23.174
Now I'm just going to take
your wandering eyes away.

54:23.175 --> 54:24.967
- No, please.
- Just be quiet now.

54:24.968 --> 54:26.969
- Shh.
- Not my eyes.

54:28.138 --> 54:29.680
Just please don't take... please.

54:29.681 --> 54:30.848
Don't, don't.
Don't, please.

54:30.849 --> 54:34.560
Don't take my fucking eyes!

54:34.561 --> 54:37.561
Not my eyes.

54:43.362 --> 54:45.154
Come on.
Come on.

54:49.451 --> 54:52.203
- No!
- Jeez, baby.

54:52.204 --> 54:54.705
I wasn't trying to kill you,
just trying to blind you.

55:11.056 --> 55:14.058
Fucking bitch, no!

55:20.315 --> 55:22.775
Dispatch, this is unit 26.

55:22.776 --> 55:27.776
Motorist possibly spotted suspect
heading north of Sherwood.

55:34.746 --> 55:38.416
Better, you big baby?

55:46.049 --> 55:49.719
You're a fucking animal.

55:49.720 --> 55:52.972
I can barely see.

55:52.973 --> 55:57.101
That's the idea, silly.

55:57.102 --> 55:58.811
All right.

55:58.812 --> 56:02.523
Here is some Vicodin...

56:02.524 --> 56:04.984
for your pain.

56:04.985 --> 56:06.527
Here's hot tea.

56:06.528 --> 56:09.906
Careful.
It's still a little warm.

56:09.907 --> 56:14.907
Careful, baby.
Don't burn your lips.

56:17.498 --> 56:20.500
I think you've learned your lesson.

56:22.169 --> 56:27.169
I'm going to go check on Jen.

56:52.741 --> 56:55.034
You still here?

56:55.035 --> 56:57.745
Please...

56:57.746 --> 56:59.288
help me.

56:59.289 --> 57:01.874
I came down here to inform you

57:01.875 --> 57:06.087
that apparently Kevin doesn't
miss you anymore at all.

57:06.088 --> 57:07.672
That's okay.

57:07.673 --> 57:12.673
I just want to go home.

57:14.805 --> 57:16.514
Oh, that's not for you.

57:16.515 --> 57:18.558
There's a boat down at the lake.

57:18.559 --> 57:20.476
Got to fill it with gas.

57:20.477 --> 57:23.145
We're going boating.

57:23.146 --> 57:25.856
I know you don't like the water.

57:25.857 --> 57:29.777
Quite frankly, I've had some
lousy luck with it myself.

57:29.778 --> 57:34.778
But I hear drowning is
a painless way to go.

57:36.368 --> 57:39.120
At least I hope so.

57:39.121 --> 57:44.121
My poor little sister.

58:11.069 --> 58:13.321
If you let me go now,

58:13.322 --> 58:15.531
I won't tell anyone,

58:15.532 --> 58:17.533
like this never happened.

58:17.534 --> 58:18.993
Let you go?

58:18.994 --> 58:20.995
Come on, Jennifer.
You think I'm crazy?

58:20.996 --> 58:22.163
Yeah.

58:22.164 --> 58:24.415
You know what?
You are crazy.

58:24.416 --> 58:26.459
You're a fucking psycho bitch!

58:26.460 --> 58:28.419
What more could you
do to me, Sadie?

58:28.420 --> 58:32.048
Kill me?

58:32.049 --> 58:35.092
That's what you plan
on doing, right?

58:35.093 --> 58:36.886
We're friends.

58:36.887 --> 58:39.597
I thought I knew you.

58:39.598 --> 58:42.350
Nobody knew you, Sadie.

58:42.351 --> 58:44.894
I slept with Kevin.
Get over it.

58:44.895 --> 58:49.895
It's not the end of the
fucking world, okay?!

58:50.108 --> 58:53.819
You're a drama queen.

58:53.820 --> 58:56.697
Sit down, drama queen.

58:56.698 --> 58:59.698
Jesus.

59:19.638 --> 59:20.888
Come on, baby.

59:27.896 --> 59:32.896
Come on, fucker.

01:00:31.835 --> 01:00:33.043
Hey.

01:00:33.044 --> 01:00:35.755
Help! Help!

01:00:35.756 --> 01:00:40.301
Jennifer, get in the car
or I'll blow your tits off.

01:00:45.348 --> 01:00:48.058
<i>♪ Does love die... ♪</i>

01:00:48.059 --> 01:00:50.895

I don't know that I'm
right for anyone.

01:01:09.956 --> 01:01:14.460
Maybe that's not true.

01:01:14.461 --> 01:01:16.670
Maybe there is one person.

01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:21.175
Yeah?
Who would that be?

01:01:21.176 --> 01:01:23.636

Haven't I always been

01:01:38.485 --> 01:01:40.277
What if I told you

01:01:40.278 --> 01:01:43.155
I loved you?

01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:47.284

wouldn't it be?

01:01:55.293 --> 01:01:58.963
I don't want to die, Sadie.

01:01:58.964 --> 01:02:02.132

01:02:13.812 --> 01:02:18.812

- Sadie.

01:02:33.999 --> 01:02:36.834
Shit!

01:02:36.835 --> 01:02:39.336
<i>♪ Does love die? ♪</i>

01:02:39.337 --> 01:02:41.797
Fucking song wasn't even over.

01:03:05.113 --> 01:03:07.448
You don't really listen, do you?

01:03:07.449 --> 01:03:11.285
You know what, Sadie?

01:03:11.286 --> 01:03:15.497
Go ahead and kill me already.

01:03:15.498 --> 01:03:18.709
That's your plan, isn't it...

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:22.546
you flat-chested whore?

01:03:22.547 --> 01:03:25.049
You know why I was
your only friend?

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:28.552
Nobody liked you.

01:03:28.553 --> 01:03:30.471
Everyone thought you were a freak.

01:03:30.472 --> 01:03:33.057
Everyone thought you were nuts.

01:03:33.058 --> 01:03:37.603
The guys knew you'd put out,
so they went out with you.

01:03:37.604 --> 01:03:40.731
That's all you were good for, Sadie,

01:03:40.732 --> 01:03:43.732
good for an easy lay.

01:03:56.831 --> 01:04:01.831
You said you loved me, Jennifer.

01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:05.422
Or were you just lying
when you said that?

01:04:05.423 --> 01:04:08.008
Fuck...

01:04:08.009 --> 01:04:10.427
you.

01:04:10.428 --> 01:04:12.137
Luau

01:04:12.138 --> 01:04:15.265
am rescinding my request for
you to be my maid of honor!

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.430
Die!

01:04:53.304 --> 01:04:57.266
What the fuck?

01:04:57.267 --> 01:05:00.894
You're a tough fuck to kill.

01:05:00.895 --> 01:05:05.895
I'll be right back.

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:15.534
What's going on?

01:05:15.535 --> 01:05:17.036
Where were you guys
10 minutes ago

01:05:17.037 --> 01:05:18.871
when I was changing my tire?

01:05:18.872 --> 01:05:21.040
Can you check my tire
and make sure it's okay?

01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:23.500
Sure.

01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:27.838
Looks good.

01:05:27.839 --> 01:05:29.131
Where you headed?

01:05:29.132 --> 01:05:31.383
Oh, just went to get
some cigarettes,

01:05:31.384 --> 01:05:33.343
head back to the house
and my boyfriend.

01:05:33.344 --> 01:05:35.888
Shady habit.

01:05:35.889 --> 01:05:37.973
The cigarettes, not my boyfriend.

01:05:37.974 --> 01:05:39.892
There was an escape just
a few miles from here.

01:05:39.893 --> 01:05:42.853
We have extra squads out.
We'll find this guy.

01:05:42.854 --> 01:05:45.439
Once you get home, make
sure you lock your doors.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.858
If you see anybody or anything
that looks out of place,

01:05:47.859 --> 01:05:49.610
you call 911, okay?

01:05:49.611 --> 01:05:51.320
Thank you, Officer, both of you.

01:05:51.321 --> 01:05:52.696
Thanks for the warning.

01:05:52.697 --> 01:05:55.199
Help.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.200
What the hell?

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:07.461
Hel - hel ...

01:06:07.462 --> 01:06:07.962
Help.

01:06:20.767 --> 01:06:25.767
What the...

01:06:27.065 --> 01:06:29.066
There really is a God after all.

01:06:32.028 --> 01:06:35.030
Jeez.

01:07:35.466 --> 01:07:36.800
Need a lift?

01:07:36.801 --> 01:07:41.801
I sure do.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.945
Buckle up.

01:07:56.946 --> 01:08:00.866
Didn't think anybody'd stop
for me on a night like this.

01:08:00.867 --> 01:08:03.493
Guess it's your lucky day.

01:08:03.494 --> 01:08:04.828
Car break down?

01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:09.333
Uh, yeah, couple miles back there.

01:08:09.334 --> 01:08:10.918
How far you going?

01:08:10.919 --> 01:08:13.337
Wherever you're heading, I guess.

01:08:13.338 --> 01:08:17.299
I ran into some cops back there.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:22.300
They said a man escaped
from prison not far from here.

01:08:22.596 --> 01:08:27.596
I didn't know they had
a prison around here.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:33.064
I bet men in prison don't...

01:08:33.066 --> 01:08:35.859
get a lot of pussy.

01:08:35.859 --> 01:08:38.737
Guess not.

01:08:38.738 --> 01:08:43.242
Bet it's been a while for you, too.

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:46.662
Don't try to figure this out.

01:08:46.662 --> 01:08:51.662
I'm just a crazy, horny bitch.

01:08:55.546 --> 01:08:59.299
Really, really horny.

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:04.011
Oh, God. Oh.

01:09:04.013 --> 01:09:05.471
Come on.

01:09:05.473 --> 01:09:10.473
I want you to come.
I want you to come.

01:09:33.626 --> 01:09:35.585
Oh, baby.

01:09:35.586 --> 01:09:36.752
That was great.

01:09:36.754 --> 01:09:40.841
Uh-huh.
Yeah, it was.

01:09:40.841 --> 01:09:42.676
I want to thank you.

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:45.261
Oh, baby, you just did thank me.

01:09:45.263 --> 01:09:46.930
No...

01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:50.434
I want to thank you for my alibi.

01:10:07.076 --> 01:10:12.076
You get me all messy.

01:10:12.874 --> 01:10:15.874
Okay.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.219
Buckle up.

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.220
Okay.

01:10:58.336 --> 01:11:00.003
Kevin!

01:11:00.004 --> 01:11:05.004
Honey, I'm back!

01:11:18.356 --> 01:11:21.356
Shit.

01:11:57.562 --> 01:12:00.562
Kevin.

01:12:03.276 --> 01:12:06.403
Baby, where are you?

01:12:06.404 --> 01:12:08.905
Show your face.

01:12:22.336 --> 01:12:25.336
Damn.

01:12:30.011 --> 01:12:34.973
Damn it. Fuck.

01:12:46.402 --> 01:12:49.402
Oh!

01:13:36.744 --> 01:13:38.662
Hey!

01:13:38.663 --> 01:13:42.332
Eh! No!

01:13:42.333 --> 01:13:45.333
No!

01:14:40.558 --> 01:14:45.558
Oh, Kevin.

01:14:49.066 --> 01:14:54.066
I forgive you now.

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:57.530
I really do.

01:15:56.050 --> 01:16:01.050
He tried to drive away after
killing my friends and raping me.

01:16:07.228 --> 01:16:10.228
Bang.

01:16:15.403 --> 01:16:20.403
And you crushed my
hand in the vise.

01:16:24.328 --> 01:16:26.329
Ah, shit.

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:31.330
This is going to hurt.

01:17:02.783 --> 01:17:04.325
Fuck.

01:17:04.326 --> 01:17:05.952
Fuck.

01:17:05.953 --> 01:17:08.371
Fuck, that really hurt.

01:17:08.372 --> 01:17:11.040
Fuck.

01:17:15.546 --> 01:17:17.839
911. What is your emergency?

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.009
This man came to the house.

01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:23.386
He killed my boyfriend.

01:17:23.387 --> 01:17:25.054
He raped me.

01:17:25.055 --> 01:17:26.556
I'm sending help.

01:17:26.557 --> 01:17:28.391
I'm notifying the paramedics.

01:17:28.392 --> 01:17:30.518
Please, you got to send someone.

01:17:30.519 --> 01:17:33.188
Help is on the way.
Ls the man still there?

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:35.523
Oh, uh, yes.

01:17:35.524 --> 01:17:37.776
- Yes, he is.
- Where is the man now?

01:17:37.777 --> 01:17:39.736
He's dead.

01:17:39.737 --> 01:17:40.904
Uh...

01:17:40.905 --> 01:17:43.239
I managed to find a
revolver in the house

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.241
and... and shoot him.

01:17:45.242 --> 01:17:48.411
Okay. Just stay calm.

01:17:48.412 --> 01:17:51.873
I'm hurt really badly.
Please send... please send someone.

01:17:51.874 --> 01:17:53.416
Just stay with me, honey.

01:17:53.417 --> 01:17:56.419
I've got the paramedics
and police on the way.

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.087
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:17:58.088 --> 01:18:01.088
Fuck.

01:18:26.784 --> 01:18:28.827
I have to ask you a few
questions, sweetheart.

01:18:28.828 --> 01:18:32.622
It's very important.
Are you allergic to any medicines?

01:18:32.623 --> 01:18:35.375
Okay, because of your injuries,
I have to ask you.

01:18:35.376 --> 01:18:38.962
Are you pregnant?

01:18:38.963 --> 01:18:41.464
No, I'm not pregnant.

01:18:41.465 --> 01:18:43.800
Okay, we're going to get you to
the hospital as quick as we can.

01:18:43.801 --> 01:18:46.553
- Doctors are waiting.
- Thank you.

01:18:46.554 --> 01:18:48.137
Found this dog.

01:18:48.138 --> 01:18:49.806
Poor thing was hiding
in the back room.

01:18:49.807 --> 01:18:52.934
Bootsie!
There you are, sweetie.

01:18:52.935 --> 01:18:55.103
I'm so glad that man
didn't hurt you.

01:18:55.104 --> 01:18:57.355
Oh.

01:18:57.356 --> 01:18:59.190
Oh, you must still be scared.

01:18:59.191 --> 01:19:00.692
That's okay, baby.
Mama's here.

01:19:00.693 --> 01:19:02.777
Mama's here. I love you.

01:19:02.778 --> 01:19:05.238
We'll take the dog.
We'll take good care of her.

01:19:05.239 --> 01:19:10.239
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.831
And, Sheriff...

01:19:14.832 --> 01:19:19.832
I just wanted to ask
you a question.

01:19:20.254 --> 01:19:23.172
Was he the man who
escaped from prison?

01:19:23.173 --> 01:19:26.092
Yeah, we think it was.

01:19:26.093 --> 01:19:28.303
You were very brave
to do what you did.

01:19:28.304 --> 01:19:30.471
You saved your life.

01:19:30.472 --> 01:19:34.851
Yeah, I just wish I could
have saved my boyfriend.

01:19:34.852 --> 01:19:39.439
You made it.
You'll be okay now.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.192
Yeah.

01:19:43.193 --> 01:19:48.193
I think I will.

01:19:59.585 --> 01:20:01.294
I'll never get it.

01:20:01.295 --> 01:20:03.463
Longer I'm on the job,

01:20:03.464 --> 01:20:05.506
the more it baffles me.

01:20:05.507 --> 01:20:07.675
I just hope that poor girl...

01:20:07.676 --> 01:20:12.676
she can get through all this.

01:20:34.244 --> 01:20:36.788
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Hi, honey.

01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:40.917
Oh, and you, too, Bootsie.

01:20:40.918 --> 01:20:43.044
Can I get you anything?

01:20:43.045 --> 01:20:48.045
I'll have an iced tea, please.

01:20:49.635 --> 01:20:51.344
Nice ass.

01:20:51.345 --> 01:20:53.763
Sadie, you're the most
beautiful girl in the world.

01:20:53.764 --> 01:20:56.391
The whole wide world and
parts of the universe, too?

01:20:56.392 --> 01:20:58.893
Most parts.

01:20:58.894 --> 01:21:00.186
I love you, Sadie.

01:21:00.187 --> 01:21:03.231
You do?

01:21:03.232 --> 01:21:05.108
So you'd never cheat on me?

01:21:05.109 --> 01:21:07.235
A guy would have to be crazy
to even look at another woman

01:21:07.236 --> 01:21:08.778
when he's got a girl
as great as you.

01:21:08.779 --> 01:21:11.531
I suppose you're right.

01:21:11.532 --> 01:21:13.408
Besides, if you cheated on me,

01:21:13.409 --> 01:21:17.954
I'd have to kill you.

01:21:17.955 --> 01:21:21.791
Hey, why are the cute
ones always taken?
