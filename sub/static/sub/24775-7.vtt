00:41.040 --> 00:42.520
You killed one of my men.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.400
I know there are more of you.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.560
Did you kill Jean?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.520
I think our wires are getting crossed.

01:16.720 --> 01:20.280
In the old days, they thought
insanity resided in the teeth.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.000
Did you know that?

01:24.320 --> 01:26.760
They pulled out one tooth after another

01:26.880 --> 01:29.480
until the patient acted sane.
Fun to think about, right?

01:31.160 --> 01:32.760
I'm not trying to cure you.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.720
I just want you to tell me
where the others are, okay?

02:32.120 --> 02:33.800
Ready to leave when you are.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.880
Get out of my way. Cut it out.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.080
Have you seen Patrick?

02:55.480 --> 02:56.560
His stuff is gone.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.920
He's not here.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.280
His time here was up.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.680
He wasn't himself when...

03:05.760 --> 03:07.240
He tried to kill you.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.520
- What have you done?
- I had no choice but to kick him out.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Right?

03:12.480 --> 03:13.800
Help!

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120
Stay here.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.840
Help!

03:25.320 --> 03:26.320
Beatrice.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.640
She won't wake up.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.760
You have to do something.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.040
Stay there.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.880
- She needs help.
- Stay there.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.720
We have to get her to the lab.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.960
- Rasmus...
- Move!

03:58.520 --> 03:59.760
Rasmus, what happened?

04:01.320 --> 04:02.360
Don't touch her.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.120
- She suddenly felt sick.
- Rasmus...

04:05.200 --> 04:07.200
- There was this dog...
- A dog?

04:07.760 --> 04:09.200
Did it get close to you, too?

04:11.400 --> 04:12.400
I don't know.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.920
Come. Get out of there.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.519
- Rasmus, get out of there.
- Why won't you help her?

04:24.400 --> 04:26.040
Why won't you help her?

04:29.040 --> 04:30.520
Why won't you help her?!

04:36.920 --> 04:38.440
Why won't you help her?!

04:39.080 --> 04:40.120
He touched her.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.640
Why are you just standing there?

04:57.160 --> 05:00.680
He shouldn't be in there.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.600
They'll be back soon. They'll help you.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.040
He shouldn't be in there with her, Martin.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.440
Martin.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.160
Go away.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.400
Rasmus, she's dead.

06:29.880 --> 06:30.880
No.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.640
There's nothing you can do.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.680
She's not dead.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.760
You have to come out.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.400
She's not dead.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.120
You have to come out.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.920
You shouldn't be in here.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.640
I'm really sorry.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.040
She can't be dead.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.200
- Rasmus...
- No.

07:14.360 --> 07:19.360
You can't stay here, Rasmus.
You have to come with me.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.120
If she's not here,
I don't want to be here either.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.400
Don't say that, Rasmus.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.080
You have to.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.160
No.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.480
Leave.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.760
See you soon.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.360
That's a nice one.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.320
Look.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.440
How about another one?

08:32.360 --> 08:33.679
They're in the bunker.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.120
In an Apollon bunker.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.120
How did you get into the bunkers?

08:46.640 --> 08:47.800
It's Simone.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.280
She can access the bunkers.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.840
Her dad works for Apollon.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.160
I see.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.520
He's gone.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.280
He's gone.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.800
What?

11:26.280 --> 11:27.280
Rasmus?

11:33.600 --> 11:34.880
Rasmus?

11:34.960 --> 11:36.320
Rasmus?

11:44.080 --> 11:45.600
Where's his stuff?

11:48.640 --> 11:50.200
He took the walkie-talkie.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.960
- We need the drone.
- What are you gonna do?

11:55.720 --> 11:58.640
Stay with Martin. I'll go look for him.

12:13.880 --> 12:14.880
Hello?

12:17.680 --> 12:18.720
<i>Hello?</i>

12:18.800 --> 12:19.840
That can't be...

12:22.080 --> 12:23.280
Who are we talking to?

12:25.800 --> 12:26.920
I'm at the quarry.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.680
<i>You can probably see it on the map.</i>

12:32.960 --> 12:35.120
I want you to come here.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.640
I don't want to go on.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.400
He should be dead by now.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.040
What do you mean?

12:43.680 --> 12:46.040
Beatrice was infected
and Rasmus carried her.

12:46.120 --> 12:49.000
This guy? Did this guy
carry someone who was infected?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.480
Why isn't he dead?

12:52.160 --> 12:53.160
We're on our way.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.800
Rasmus.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.400
Was it you who carried the dead girl?

14:10.160 --> 14:11.160
When was that?

14:16.560 --> 14:17.680
I just want to die.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.280
Stand up.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
Good.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.360
That guy said you were
carrying around a dead girl.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.880
- Beatrice.
- Was she infected?

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
Was she infected?

14:56.200 --> 14:57.640
- How?
- I don't know.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.320
- Think.
- I don't know.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.240
Was there anyone else around?
People? Animals?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.040
A dog.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.560
A dog?

15:10.400 --> 15:13.720
- There was a dog. It licked our faces.
- Yours too?

15:17.440 --> 15:18.440
Answer me.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.360
Amazing.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.000
Martin, put this on.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.440
Come.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.400
She can't stay in there.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.280
You can do this. You can, and you must.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.600
It's not fair.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.320
No, it's not fair.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.720
- It isn't.
- It's not fair.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.680
Of course it's not fair.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.320
It's not fair...

15:59.240 --> 16:01.160
that someone I knew for six years...

16:02.840 --> 16:03.840
is dead.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.840
It's not fair what happened to Jean
or any of the others.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.360
But she shouldn't be in there.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.080
Come. Put this on.

16:16.960 --> 16:17.960
Come.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.840
Dear sweet Beatrice...

16:30.000 --> 16:31.560
I'm convinced...

16:32.480 --> 16:34.560
that neither death...

16:35.880 --> 16:36.880
nor life...

16:38.840 --> 16:41.960
nor anything in the present
or in the days to come...

16:44.160 --> 16:46.200
can separate us from God's love.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.560
She always knew she would...

16:54.320 --> 16:55.400
I'm sorry.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.800
She always knew she would die.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.520
That it was just how things had become.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.920
She was brave.
She dared death to come for her.

17:14.760 --> 17:15.760
And it did.

17:19.599 --> 17:20.960
But she's right here.

17:22.119 --> 17:23.280
And right here.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.440
And she will be there forever.

17:40.640 --> 17:41.880
You were so stubborn.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.240
They have Rasmus.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.400
- What?
- They have him.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.200
The Strangers.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.280
It can't be anyone else.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.840
It makes absolutely no sense
that he didn't die.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.680
But we have to save him.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.120
I'd prefer to kick his ass.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.320
Let's save him first.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.120
You can kick his ass after.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.760
There are four people there
besides Rasmus... if that's him.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.840
It makes sense
that he would go back there.

20:11.960 --> 20:12.960
Yes.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.120
Let's start with him.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.200
What are you giving him?

20:34.120 --> 20:35.120
Morphine.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.760
Need to keep him going
so we can leave for Apollon.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Patrick.

21:52.920 --> 21:53.920
<i>Hello?</i>

21:54.680 --> 21:55.680
<i>Anyone there?</i>

22:04.520 --> 22:06.280
Hello? Who the hell are you?

22:06.360 --> 22:07.560
We have one of your men.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.200
If you want to see him again,
we want our guy back.

22:13.760 --> 22:17.320
<i>We don't want to hurt or kill anyone.
We just want him back.</i>

22:18.720 --> 22:19.720
You can't.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.200
I'll get back to you tomorrow.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.880
The guy says your brother is immune.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.840
It would explain why he wasn't
contaminated when Beatrice was.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.800
That's insane.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.320
He's probably making it up.

23:20.960 --> 23:21.960
I'm sorry.

23:22.920 --> 23:23.920
For what?

23:24.920 --> 23:25.920
Rasmus.

23:26.720 --> 23:29.040
I was upset... you know?

23:30.400 --> 23:32.840
- You don't need to apologize.
- Yes, I do.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.240
No, you don't.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.040
You loved her.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.320
Do you know the feeling of knowing
something will end before it starts?

23:49.920 --> 23:50.920
It's like...

23:53.040 --> 23:55.160
I've always known it wasn't meant to be.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.560
It was just there.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.120
That's how it was.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.640
And now it's not anymore.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.880
We'll get him back.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.920
I promise.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.800
Martin, you have to forgive Patrick.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.200
Why do you want to die?

24:45.640 --> 24:46.640
<i>Hello?</i>

24:46.960 --> 24:47.960
<i>Are you there?</i>

24:49.960 --> 24:51.920
Yes, I'm here.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.280
Okay. Listen, nothing has changed.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.640
<i>You've taken our friend
and we want him back.</i>

24:58.120 --> 24:59.320
He came to us.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.800
- He came to you?
- Rasmus...

25:00.880 --> 25:03.160
Listen, you took him prisoner.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.440
<i>Is he free to leave?</i>

25:04.520 --> 25:07.400
I think we have the same goal.
We want to get out of here.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.800
- We should meet. Bring Rasmus.
- Hey.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.400
Rasmus?

25:12.480 --> 25:15.800
<i>I know why you left, but you can't
do that. We've come so far.</i>

25:17.360 --> 25:18.920
<i>We have to stick together.</i>

25:20.720 --> 25:21.920
Can you hear me?

25:24.640 --> 25:25.640
Say something.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.720
I don't want to be here anymore.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.440
<i>He doesn't want to talk to you.</i>

25:36.320 --> 25:37.600
I want to meet with you.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.800
- Alone.
- No.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.280
In the forest,
by the entrance to Sector Three.

25:43.440 --> 25:44.440
<i>On my way.</i>

26:13.400 --> 26:15.800
- I want my brother back.
- Your brother?

26:16.880 --> 26:18.160
He's sick as a dog.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.560
Stay out of it.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.680
I don't know how you intend to use him,
but forget it.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.440
- What if he's the one we think he is?
- The one you think...?

26:26.520 --> 26:27.520
If he's immune.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.920
If he is, he's the one we've been
looking for for four years,

26:32.000 --> 26:33.760
the one who can make all this go away.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.880
And how do you intend to do that?

26:37.760 --> 26:40.640
- By injecting him with the virus.
- No.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.040
That's not going to happen.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.880
- If he's immune...
- And if he's not?

26:44.960 --> 26:46.720
- He'll die.
- It's not going to happen.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.320
- Ready for the exchange?
- Ivan.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.080
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.160
He's just fine.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.000
Where's Rasmus?

27:01.720 --> 27:02.720
Answer me.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.440
Lea.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.040
Where did you get that?

27:10.800 --> 27:12.400
How important is he to you?

27:14.600 --> 27:15.960
I'll count to three.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
One!

27:22.560 --> 27:23.560
Two!

27:34.520 --> 27:35.760
Three!

27:35.840 --> 27:36.960
No, no! Okay.

27:49.720 --> 27:51.920
- Rasmus.
- Are you okay, Rasmus?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Come.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.360
Come, Rasmus.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.040
- Go back to your sister.
- Come, Rasmus.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.200
Come.

27:59.800 --> 28:00.800
Come over here.

28:02.800 --> 28:03.800
Go on.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
Rasmus.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.160
Just cross the bridge.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.320
Come.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.080
I don't want to.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.000
- Come, Rasmus.
- Leave me alone!

28:20.720 --> 28:23.440
I'll go with them, I'll get a shot,
and then I'll just...

28:23.520 --> 28:26.120
Shut the hell up! Do you hear me?

28:26.920 --> 28:28.840
All of this is because of you.

28:28.920 --> 28:33.040
People are gone because you needed
protection. Do you understand that?

28:53.880 --> 28:54.880
- No!
- Rasmus!

28:56.160 --> 28:58.040
No more people should die because of me.

28:58.880 --> 28:59.880
Stop!

29:29.160 --> 29:30.160
Rasmus.

30:08.800 --> 30:09.800
Rasmus.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.560
What the hell's happening?

30:22.600 --> 30:23.600
Rasmus.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.840
Look at me.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.120
Rasmus?

30:43.400 --> 30:44.400
It's him.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.560
Hi.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.280
Hi.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
We're...

31:26.080 --> 31:27.960
We're just here to get Rasmus.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.200
- Are you messing with me?
- Yeah.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.640
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.400
Fuck, that makes me happy to hear.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.840
- Are you coming?
- Oh, hell yes.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.960
Get me out of these, will you?

31:54.760 --> 31:56.120
This is crazy.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.520
Sorry about everything.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.400
So why are we going to Apollon?

32:26.360 --> 32:27.960
To do tests on him.

32:28.520 --> 32:31.360
If Rasmus is carrying the antidote
and it works,

32:31.680 --> 32:33.480
the others can leave the zone.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.560
You decide for yourself
what you want to do.

32:35.640 --> 32:36.760
Why should we trust you?

32:36.840 --> 32:39.680
Because deep down you know
we're all in the same situation.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.200
Rasmus.

32:51.760 --> 32:52.760
Hey.

32:53.305 --> 32:59.938
