OVER ONE ANOTHER]

39:32.457 --> 39:33.806
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

39:34.415 --> 39:35.764
YOU GUYS DRIVE SAFE.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.505
-MISS TAMALE, COME ON.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.289
-BYE, THANKS.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.162
-I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TURNED HIM DOWN.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.861
-I'M A LIFEGUARD,
NOT A HOT TAMALE.

39:45.992 --> 39:47.907
BESIDES, IT'S WINTER
TIME IN BRAZIL

39:48.037 --> 39:48.908
AND I'M READY FOR SUMMER.

39:49.691 --> 39:51.998
-I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT
PAOLO SAID ANYTHING

39:52.128 --> 39:54.043
ABOUT MY PORTFOLIO.
-AS A MATTER OF FACT--

39:54.174 --> 39:56.219
-HE HATED IT, I KNEW IT.
FORGET IT, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.787
-NO, NO, HE SAID YOU WERE
A VERY TALENTED DESIGNER

39:58.918 --> 40:00.659
AND THAT YOU SHOULD
STOP BEING SO INSECURE.

40:00.789 --> 40:01.877
YOUR TIME WILL COME.

40:02.008 --> 40:03.618
-MY TIME WILL COME, HUH?

40:03.749 --> 40:05.272
WERE THOSE HIS EXACT WORDS?

40:05.403 --> 40:08.275
-WELL, ACTUALLY, HIS
ASSISTANT WAS TRANSLATING,

40:08.406 --> 40:10.146
BUT I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT HE MEANT.

40:10.886 --> 40:11.844
HE'S RIGHT, APRIL.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.193
-THANKS, BRIDGET.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.022
-LADIES.
-APRIL: HEY.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.110
-HEY, CHIEF.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.677
-CHIEF: HI, MITCH.

40:18.807 --> 40:19.591
-WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
COUNTY'S COMMISSIONERS?

40:19.721 --> 40:20.679
-THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT.

40:20.809 --> 40:22.245
-HEY, HEY, HANG ON A SECOND.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.204
YOU PROMISED ME THEY
WOULD TOUR MY FACILITY

40:24.334 --> 40:25.553
BEFORE THEY MAKE A DECISION.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.381
-THERE'S NO
DECISION TO MAKE.

40:27.512 --> 40:30.776
BAYGUARD WITHDREW THEIR BID
WHEN ALEX RYKER RESIGNED.

40:31.646 --> 40:33.169
-ALEX RESIGNED.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.258
-I KNOW YOU TWO DIDN'T
ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.999
-THAT'S OKAY, I WISH
HER NOTHING BUT THE BEST

40:37.130 --> 40:38.653
DOWN THERE IN ORANGE COUNTY.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.960
-ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHAT I
CAME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

40:41.090 --> 40:44.006
NOW, THIS IN NO WAY IS
A REFLECTION ON THE JOB
THAT YOU'RE DOING.

40:44.137 --> 40:45.138
I MEAN, THE BEACH
HAS NEVER BEEN SAFER.

40:45.268 --> 40:46.705
-BUT.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.533
-BUT YOU'RE TWO MONTHS
BEHIND ON YOUR PAPERWORK

40:48.663 --> 40:51.057
AND 20% OVER BUDGET
AT LAST COUNT

40:51.187 --> 40:53.712
AND FRANKLY, I DON'T SEE
ANY SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT.

40:53.842 --> 40:55.409
I MEAN, WE BOTH KNOW THAT
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT

40:55.540 --> 40:57.890
YOUR STRONG SUIT, I MEAN,
YOU'RE A FIELD GENERAL.

40:58.804 --> 41:00.501
-A FIELD GENERAL.

41:00.632 --> 41:02.372
-EXACTLY WHICH IS WHY I'VE
DECIDED TO BRING ALEX IN AS A--

41:02.503 --> 41:03.939
-NO.

41:04.070 --> 41:04.984
-CHIEF: AS AN
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSULTANT--

41:05.114 --> 41:06.115
-DON'T YOU DO THIS TO ME.

41:06.246 --> 41:08.117
-ON A TEMPORARY BASIS.

41:08.248 --> 41:10.685
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT, WE'LL
TRY A DIFFERENT APPROACH.

41:10.816 --> 41:12.731
IN THE MEANTIME,
I BROUGHT HER BY

41:12.861 --> 41:14.297
TO SHOW HER THE HEADQUARTERS.

41:14.428 --> 41:15.777
-MORNING, CHIEF.
-CHIEF: MORNING.

41:15.908 --> 41:17.126
-LIEUTENANT BUCHANNON.

41:17.257 --> 41:18.258
-YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH. GOOD MORNING.

41:18.388 --> 41:19.912
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

41:20.042 --> 41:21.783
-NOW MITCH, COME ON,
WE'RE BOTH MATURE ADULTS.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.481
I'M SURE WE CAN TRY TO FIND
A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK

41:23.611 --> 41:24.830
FOR BOTH OF US.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.527
NOW COME ON, I
WANT A GRAND TOUR.

41:26.658 --> 41:28.529
YOU KNOW YOU LIKE
ME. COME ON.
