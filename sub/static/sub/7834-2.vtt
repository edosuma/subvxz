01:05.230 --> 01:07.199
D'oh!

01:23.483 --> 01:25.781
Here you go, boy.
Soup's on.

01:25.885 --> 01:27.785
Whoa!

01:29.889 --> 01:31.789
Hmm? Hmm?

01:31.891 --> 01:33.791
Hmm?

01:33.893 --> 01:37.192
Hey, if you're out here,
then who's in there?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.930
<i>Whoa, a badger!</i>

01:41.034 --> 01:43.264
Sorry, man.
You can't crash here.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.269
Come on, let's go.

01:47.373 --> 01:51.207
Well, boy, looks like you got yourself a roommate.

01:53.313 --> 01:56.214
Come on, Lise. There's gotta be a way
to lure that badger out.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.784
Well, according to
WhatBadgersEat. Com...

01:58.885 --> 02:03.083
"Badgers subsist primarily on a diet
of stoats, voles and marmots."

02:03.189 --> 02:05.419
Hmm, stoats.
Stoats.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.857
Stoats are weasels, Bart.
They don't come in cans.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.556
- Then what's this?
- That says "corn," Bart.

02:12.899 --> 02:15.390
- Must you embarrass me?
- Here we are.

02:15.502 --> 02:19.268
- " In a pinch, badgers have been
known to eat woodpeckers."
- Perfect!

02:19.372 --> 02:21.499
Hey, Todd. Can we
borrow your woodpecker?

02:21.608 --> 02:25.738
I guess so. But we need him back by 6:00.
It's his birthday.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.506
Okay.

02:32.619 --> 02:35.349
Ow!

02:38.224 --> 02:41.455
Hmm.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.431
- Television broken?
- No. There's a badger in there.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.434
Badger, my ass.
It's probably Milhouse.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.163
Milhouse.
Milhouse!

03:00.146 --> 03:03.309
It's a badger, all right,
or possibly a griffin.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.145
- Do you have any dynamite?
- Tons.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.811
- Get it.
- No, Dad. We don't want to kill him.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.821
- Let's call Animal Control.
- Great idea.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.652
Then we should call the doctor
about this.

03:11.758 --> 03:16.491
- How did the badger do that
without ripping your shirt?
- What am I, a tailor?

03:16.596 --> 03:18.393
Hmm!

03:20.667 --> 03:22.567
Hmm?

03:22.669 --> 03:25.069
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

03:25.171 --> 03:28.072
- Please make sure you have the correct area code.
- Area code?

03:28.174 --> 03:30.074
But it's a local call.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.076
The phone company
ran out of numbers...

03:32.178 --> 03:34.772
so they split the city
into two area codes.

03:34.881 --> 03:39.750
Half the town keeps the old 636 area code,
and our half gets 939.

03:39.852 --> 03:42.753
939?
What the hell is that?

03:42.855 --> 03:44.948
Oh, my life is ruined!

03:45.058 --> 03:47.424
Geez, you just have to remember
three extra numbers.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.927
Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge.

03:50.029 --> 03:53.226
Go away! We got bigger problems now!

03:53.333 --> 03:55.233
I'm not gonna stand for this.

03:55.335 --> 03:59.237
I'm gonna call the newspapers,
the TV stations, the gas stations, everybody!

04:13.820 --> 04:17.187
I hate this new area code.
Like I don't have enough to remember already.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.451
Is that right?

04:19.559 --> 04:22.790
Don't you miss
the old 636... Carl?

04:22.895 --> 04:24.419
I'm not sure which one's better.

04:24.530 --> 04:27.795
The six is closer to the three,
so you got convenience there.

04:27.900 --> 04:31.836
But the nine has less to do with Satan,
which is a plus in this religious world of ours.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.374
What really burns me up is
they didn't give us one word of warning!

04:35.475 --> 04:38.876
What do you mean? They ran those TV
commercials about it and that big radio campaign.

04:38.978 --> 04:41.378
Don't forget the leaflets
they dropped from the space shuttle.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.779
And the two weeks
we all spent at area code camp.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.351
Not a single word of warning.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.580
<i>And traffic's all backed up</i>
<i>due to a mattress on the freeway.</i>

04:49.689 --> 04:51.589
A mattress?
Uh-oh.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.591
Joan Collins must be in town.

04:56.529 --> 04:58.861
Oh, behave!

04:58.965 --> 05:02.128
Joan Collins?
That girl sleeps with everybody!

05:02.235 --> 05:05.466
Okay, time to give away
free concert tickets.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.471
What you talkin' about?

05:07.573 --> 05:10.474
What we're talking about, Gary, is the Who!

05:10.576 --> 05:13.477
We're giving away tickets
to next week's concert...

05:13.579 --> 05:16.514
at Springfield's historic
Yahoo Search Engine Arena!

05:16.616 --> 05:19.744
The Who? I love bands!

05:19.852 --> 05:22.753
And now we'll dial
our big winner at random.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.517
# Dialing at random #

05:25.625 --> 05:29.152
Okay, let's start with 5-5-5...

05:29.262 --> 05:33.096
0-1-1 and 3.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.531
That's my number!

05:35.635 --> 05:38.195
Ahoy-hoy!

05:38.304 --> 05:40.204
Hey, that's not me.

05:40.306 --> 05:43.207
Dad, we're not
in their area code anymore.

05:43.309 --> 05:47.006
Congratulations!
You're gonna rendezvous with the Who!

05:47.113 --> 05:49.707
Ohh! It's not fair!

05:49.816 --> 05:54.219
I've been a fan of the Who since the very beginning
when they were the Hillbilly Bugger Boys!

05:54.320 --> 05:57.346
- You should call that radio station
and let 'em have it!
- Good idea!

06:00.059 --> 06:02.289
Why, you little-

06:05.398 --> 06:08.595
Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:14.774 --> 06:18.835
I know that some of you are upset
about the area code change...

06:18.945 --> 06:21.846
especially those of you
covered with dynamite.

06:21.948 --> 06:27.250
First, let me reassure you your fears
are groundless and your complaints moronic.

06:27.353 --> 06:30.049
- That's good.
- This film will explain everything to you...

06:30.156 --> 06:32.124
in words that you can understand.

06:36.362 --> 06:40.264
Hi. I'm Phoney McRingring, mascot
and president of the telephone company.

06:40.366 --> 06:43.802
I'm here to explain why
the convenience of one area code in...

06:43.903 --> 06:45.803
<i>Your town.</i>

06:45.905 --> 06:49.068
Has been replaced by the convenience
of two area codes.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.075
Uh, I have a question, Phoney.

06:51.177 --> 06:54.510
- It's a movie, Dad.
- Quiet, honey. Daddy's asking the man a question.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.515
You're probably thinking,
"Sure, more area codes are great...

06:57.617 --> 07:00.518
"and I don't mind
paying the extra hidden fees...

07:00.620 --> 07:02.952
but how will I
remember all those numbers?"

07:03.055 --> 07:04.955
Whoa!

07:05.057 --> 07:09.460
Well, scientists have discovered
that even monkeys can memorize 10 numbers.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.723
Are you stupider than a monkey?

07:11.831 --> 07:14.265
How big of a monkey?

07:14.367 --> 07:17.029
Of course you're not.

07:17.136 --> 07:21.163
Well, I'm convinced. A professional-looking
film like that has gotta be right.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.141
I agree. Two area codes
is more convenient.

07:24.243 --> 07:26.143
- <i>I like it!</i>
- Wait a minute!

07:26.245 --> 07:29.214
We haven't heard from me yet,
the nut with the dynamite!

07:29.315 --> 07:32.409
The phone company is bamboozling you!

07:32.518 --> 07:36.113
I accuse the phone company
of making that film on purpose!

07:36.222 --> 07:38.349
Well, of course we did.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.858
Now, I'm not one to make trouble...

07:40.960 --> 07:43.952
but it seems to me that everyone
who got to keep the old...

07:44.063 --> 07:46.998
or "classic," 636 area code...

07:47.099 --> 07:50.091
lives on the rich side of town!

07:50.203 --> 07:52.831
- Oh, poppycock!
- I never!
- Eeeww.

07:52.939 --> 07:58.707
And as usual, weJoe Twelve-Packs
get the royal screw-job!

07:58.811 --> 08:02.440
Homer's right! We're gettin'
theJoan Collins special!

08:02.548 --> 08:05.073
- He's right!
- We're gettin' it but good!

08:05.184 --> 08:07.084
Well, I've had it!

08:07.186 --> 08:09.882
You rich snobs aren't
pushing us around anymore!

08:09.989 --> 08:12.753
And what are you pathetic slobs
going to do about it?

08:12.859 --> 08:14.759
Well, l-

08:14.861 --> 08:16.761
Huh?

08:18.865 --> 08:21.766
- Oh, nice wiring, Bart!
- Worked on the test corpse.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.768
Okay, plan "B."

08:23.870 --> 08:28.500
Fellow 939'ers, I say we break off
and form our own city!

08:28.608 --> 08:31.634
- Yes!
- We're with you, Homer!

08:31.744 --> 08:33.871
Come on! Let's go!

08:33.980 --> 08:36.039
<i>Viva la revoluci√≥n!</i>

08:36.148 --> 08:37.513
<i>Now who's stupid?</i>

08:41.754 --> 08:44.518
There.
We're officially a city.

08:44.624 --> 08:48.025
Now we just sit back and wait
for an N.F.L. Franchise.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.029
Say, I couldn't help but overhear.

08:52.131 --> 08:53.894
I represent the Arizona Cardinals.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.729
Keep walking.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.736
Good decision there, Homer.
You showed a lot of poise.

08:58.838 --> 09:01.534
Yeah. Maybe you oughta be
mayor of New Springfield.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.404
Mayor, eh?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.339
<i>The Mayor.</i>

09:10.650 --> 09:13.118
<i>Starring Homer Simpson.</i>

09:13.219 --> 09:17.986
I reluctantly accept this
highly-paid, glamorous job.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.123
Presenting our new plaque.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.821
I say the time for bitterness
has passed.

09:23.930 --> 09:28.264
Let us extend to our brothers
in New Springfield the olive branch of-

09:28.367 --> 09:30.267
New Springfield rocks!

09:30.369 --> 09:33.065
Go ahead and laugh.

09:33.172 --> 09:36.539
- We have a better town bird.
- Oh, yeah? What is it?

09:36.642 --> 09:39.202
- The bluebird.
- Damn it.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.542
<i>More wheat cakes,</i>
<i>Mr. Mayor?</i>

09:41.647 --> 09:44.377
Read my lips-
Yes.

09:44.483 --> 09:46.212
Dad, you got syrup
on your sash.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.719
No problem.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.721
- If you ask me-
- Stop right there.

09:50.823 --> 09:53.758
It's stupid to divide the city
over something as silly as an area code.

09:53.859 --> 09:56.623
It would be like you and Mom
splitting up every time you have a fight.

09:56.729 --> 10:00.927
Sweetie, you know your mother and I only
stay together for the sake of my political career.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.524
- That's not true!
- Big grins.

10:03.636 --> 10:07.003
That'll play great in the sticks.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.843
Oh, that was 50 already?

10:13.479 --> 10:15.709
Go long!

10:20.353 --> 10:24.187
Hey, look what I found.
A novelty flying disk.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.088
<i>Give it back!</i>
<i>That's</i> my <i>novelty flying disk.</i>

10:27.193 --> 10:29.787
You're in Olde Springfield now!

10:29.895 --> 10:33.194
Everything on this side
of the park belongs to us!

10:33.299 --> 10:36.427
- Hey, his pants are in our park too!
- Get him!

10:41.874 --> 10:44.172
My homework is in your park.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.676
- Let's do it!
- Yoink!

10:47.747 --> 10:49.305
What does freedom mean to me?

10:49.415 --> 10:52.748
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Root beer, bananas and toilet paper.</i>

10:52.852 --> 10:54.752
Fifty percent out-of-towners' tax.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.344
Out-of-towner tax?

10:56.455 --> 11:00.323
I'm sorry, Mrs. Simpson, but we have
to charge you foreign devils more.

11:00.426 --> 11:04.328
All right. But this better be
the best toilet paper I've ever had.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.627
Oh, no worries there.
That's Henderson's toilet paper!

11:07.733 --> 11:09.928
Ooh!
Why didn't you say so?

11:10.036 --> 11:12.596
- Hey, is there a bathroom here?
- Not for you.

11:14.707 --> 11:18.165
<i>I don't know why,</i>
<i>but I just didn't feel comfortable...</i>

11:18.277 --> 11:21.542
until I was back here in New Springfield
with my own kind.

11:21.647 --> 11:24.013
- Mom!
- They were looking at me...

11:24.116 --> 11:26.243
with their eyes.

11:26.352 --> 11:31.221
As expected, New Springfield's
bold experiment in slob rule is a disaster.

11:31.323 --> 11:33.951
Hey, the TV man is talking about us.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.554
A study shows their crumbling economy
is due to their lazy attitude and shoddy work.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.564
How the hell did they find that out?

11:40.666 --> 11:42.531
<i>Scientists say they're also</i>
<i>less attractive physically...</i>

11:42.635 --> 11:45.035
and while we speak
in a well-educated manner...

11:45.137 --> 11:48.971
they tend to use lowbrow expressions
like, "Oh, yeah?" and "C'mere a minute."

11:49.075 --> 11:52.442
Oh, yeah? They think they're better than us, huh?
Bart, c'mere a minute!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.376
- You c'mere a minute!
- Oh, yeah?

12:00.219 --> 12:02.744
Dad, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.755
Thank you, <i>Marge.</i>

12:04.857 --> 12:09.726
Now let's see how Olde Snob-field does
without electricity.

12:09.829 --> 12:12.696
Whoo-hoo!

12:14.100 --> 12:17.001
Oh, no.
You can't do heart surgery in the dark!

12:17.103 --> 12:20.266
- Sounds like a wager to me.
- I'll take a piece of that.

12:20.372 --> 12:25.002
I will now transport
Sir Isaac Newton into the modern day.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.271
<i>Warning! Power failure!</i>

12:28.380 --> 12:30.678
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>
<i>Sweet glayvin!</i>

12:30.783 --> 12:33.684
Oh, good God! Hey, wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Oh! Oh!

12:33.786 --> 12:35.777
Sir Isaac's legs are hurting!

12:35.888 --> 12:38.448
<i>In retaliation for the power outage...</i>

12:38.557 --> 12:42.687
Olde Springfield patriots have intercepted
a beer truck bound for New Springfield...

12:42.795 --> 12:45.195
and dumped all the beer in the river.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.959
Those rich, snobby Indians.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.831
- There's nothing like revenge
for getting back at people.
- I don't know. Vengeance is good.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.841
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>
<i>Blood for water!</i>

12:57.943 --> 13:01.174
They got us now!
Without water, we're doomed!

13:01.280 --> 13:04.909
Wait a minute. What's that gold-colored
substance in the riverbed?

13:05.017 --> 13:08.248
Why, that's gold.

13:08.354 --> 13:11.915
We're slightly richer!

13:12.024 --> 13:13.582
Eureka!

13:13.692 --> 13:15.592
With the money
made from the gold...

13:15.694 --> 13:20.290
Olde Springfield was able to buy the Evian
water factory and fly it over here from France.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.697
- Ohh!
- Thanks, Mayor Simpson.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.100
Because of you,
we're all takin' golden showers!

13:25.204 --> 13:26.171
What?

13:32.211 --> 13:33.940
We can't go on fighting
with Olde Springfield!

13:34.046 --> 13:35.445
These people are our neighbors.
We see them every day.

13:35.548 --> 13:38.449
You're right! We've got to block them
from our sight with a giant wall!

13:38.551 --> 13:41.145
- Like the one in Berlin?
- Good idea.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.244
We should call the guys they used.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.055
- Homer.
- It's ringing!

13:54.099 --> 13:58.468
<i>And I'd like to thank Low Ball Construction</i>
<i>for building this amazing wall...</i>

13:58.571 --> 14:01.369
<i>from 90% recycled materials.</i>

14:04.376 --> 14:06.367
- I'm so conflicted.
- About what?

14:06.478 --> 14:09.470
Loyal citizens of New Springfield...

14:09.582 --> 14:11.914
you stayed on my side of town...

14:12.017 --> 14:15.475
despite a total lack
of hospitals and schools...

14:15.588 --> 14:19.319
and a sewage nightmare
that threatens to consume us all.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.950
How will we get our food?
All the roads are blocked.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.552
Don't worry.

14:24.663 --> 14:28.190
We have plenty of supplies
to get through tomorrow.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.666
And then a wave of disease
should help to-

14:30.769 --> 14:33.795
Hey!
Stop streaming over the wall!

14:33.906 --> 14:36.204
At least wait till I'm through talking.

14:36.308 --> 14:39.436
Okay. Now as for food,
the following breeds of dog are edible-

14:39.545 --> 14:41.740
- See ya!
- <i>Bye, Homer!</i>

14:43.449 --> 14:47.545
Oh! I can't believe
all those rats fled my town.

14:47.653 --> 14:50.622
Guess it's just us
and the tumbleweed.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.816
Oh!

14:57.930 --> 15:00.831
Well, Dad, you're mayor
of a ghost town.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.334
I can't believe
those traitors abandoned us.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.904
They couldn't take one lousy famine.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.497
Dad, you're bleeding!

15:09.608 --> 15:11.508
No problem.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.041
Anyhow, those rats
will come crawling back.

15:17.149 --> 15:20.744
<i>Ha-ha. We've got the Who</i>
<i>playin'here tonight.</i>

15:20.853 --> 15:23.754
Dad, the arena's in Olde Springfield.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.790
- D'oh!
- Don't give up, Dad.

15:25.891 --> 15:28.291
Maybe we can get the Who
to play here instead.

15:28.394 --> 15:31.363
Hey, maybe we could.

15:31.463 --> 15:34.227
But we'll need some liquid persuasion.

15:38.003 --> 15:40.437
Come on, Bart.
We're gonna bring back the Who!

15:54.019 --> 15:55.919
Can I help you?

15:56.021 --> 15:58.546
- Uh-
- Dad! The chloroform!

15:58.657 --> 16:01.091
Huh?
Oh, right.

16:01.193 --> 16:04.651
I'll give you this bottle of chloroform
if you'll take us to the Who.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.958
- D'oh!
- Oh, so you wanna see the Who, huh?

16:07.066 --> 16:09.159
Well, I'll take you to the Who.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.395
Here's your Who!

16:13.739 --> 16:16.173
- I thought we fired that guard.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

16:16.275 --> 16:19.574
I got fired by the Who.
Whatever you say, pal.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.578
Wacko.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.046
Wow.
The Who!

16:26.151 --> 16:28.813
Whoo! Rock and roll!

16:30.923 --> 16:34.359
- What the hell are you doing?
- Duh! Trashing the hotel room.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.360
But we promised
the desk clerk we'd be good.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.589
Yeah. We don't want to lose
our pool privileges.

16:38.697 --> 16:41.894
Whatever.
The point is, I'm Homer Simpson.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.266
- The mayor of New Springfield?
- That's right.

16:45.371 --> 16:48.272
- The <i>crazy</i> mayor of New Springfield?
- That's right.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.468
And I implore you to move
your concert to our town.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.477
Don't play Olde Springfield...

16:53.579 --> 16:56.980
or as it is sometimes known,
Sun City.

16:57.082 --> 16:59.346
But we have a handshake agreement
with a concert promoter...

16:59.451 --> 17:01.351
and that's a sacred bond.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.148
Sacred bond.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.155
Come on.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.555
What happened to the angry, defiant Who
of"My Generation"...

17:07.659 --> 17:10.560
"Won't Get Fooled Again"
And "Mama's Got a Squeeze Box"?

17:10.662 --> 17:12.095
We know our songs, Homer.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.097
But those Olde Springfield squares...

17:14.199 --> 17:17.099
are just gonna make you cut your hair,
turn down your music...

17:17.202 --> 17:19.693
and wear frilly shirts
like Keith Partridge.

17:19.805 --> 17:22.535
Keith Partridge?
Who huddle!

17:26.845 --> 17:29.177
- We'll do it!
- Yeah!

17:29.281 --> 17:32.045
- Just send a cab for us.
- Is something wrong with your legs?

17:32.151 --> 17:34.346
You're right.
The walk will do us good.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.088
I opened for the Who at Woodstock.

17:39.191 --> 17:41.853
I came out in a Beatle wig
with a ukulele.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.691
Hendrix said he almost plotzed.
His exact words.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.392
Oh, I never tire of <i>that</i> story.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.900
Smithers, why did you iron a crease
in these dungarees?

17:51.003 --> 17:52.903
I look like a square.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.496
Uh, that crease is in your leg, sir.

17:55.607 --> 17:57.575
Oh, so it is. Yes.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.938
Hmm. It's not like the Who
to be tardy. I'm worried.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.812
What's that?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.818
Yarrr! 'Tis the Who.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.822
By my reckoning, they're in the scurvy depths
of New Springfield.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.825
Homer stole our rock performance!

18:14.927 --> 18:18.294
That fat, dumb and bald guy
sure plays some real hardball.

18:18.397 --> 18:20.422
Who's ready to riot?

18:23.202 --> 18:25.898
# I won't get to get what I'm after #

18:26.004 --> 18:29.337
#Till the day I die #

18:31.510 --> 18:33.501
How you doing out there, New Springfield?

18:39.585 --> 18:40.552
To be honest, it's a little chilly-

18:40.652 --> 18:41.619
- Oww!
- <i>Get out of the way, Marge.</i>

18:41.720 --> 18:43.187
We were expecting
a bigger crowd, Homer.

18:43.288 --> 18:47.418
Don't worry. They'll be here.
And then they'll see who's got the better town.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.723
Now, these are the tunes
I want you boys to play.

18:50.829 --> 18:52.729
Wait a minute.
Homer!

18:52.831 --> 18:55.061
A lot of these are
Grand Funk Railroad songs!

18:55.167 --> 18:57.067
And we don't know "Pac-Man Fever."

18:57.169 --> 18:59.296
Oh, come on.
It plays itself!

18:59.404 --> 19:01.269
# Pac-Man fever #

19:01.373 --> 19:02.772
# Doo-doo-doo-doo #

19:02.875 --> 19:06.811
# It's a-driving me crazy #

19:06.912 --> 19:08.880
Look, Lisa.
Daddy's in the Who.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.979
Ooh!

19:14.887 --> 19:16.787
Oww!

19:16.889 --> 19:18.880
Give us back our concert, Simpson!

19:18.991 --> 19:22.688
So, New Springfield's looking
pretty good now, isn't it...

19:22.794 --> 19:25.729
with our ample parking
and daily Who concerts?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.731
- Daily?
- We'll talk.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.325
All right, enough chitchat.
Let's see how you like flaming garbage!

19:36.408 --> 19:39.036
Ha-ha.
#You hit the tire fire #

19:39.144 --> 19:40.805
You'll have to do-
Oww!

19:40.913 --> 19:44.576
Oh, why me? Oh, oww!

19:44.683 --> 19:47.982
People, please,
what's all this fighting about?

19:48.086 --> 19:50.316
Apparently they have
two different area codes.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.515
Well, I'll be chuggered.
That's the sticky wicket?

19:52.624 --> 19:55.422
Why not just buy telephones
with auto ring-up?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.722
Or as you Yanks call it, "speed dial."

19:59.464 --> 20:02.627
- Radio Shack has some great ones.
- Oh, says you.

20:02.734 --> 20:05.931
- "Magic Bus"!
- Yeah, "Magic Bus"!

20:06.038 --> 20:09.997
Okay! We'll play "Magic Bus"
if you tear down this wall!

20:11.543 --> 20:13.306
"Pinball Wizard"!

20:13.412 --> 20:15.380
Oh, hell.
I'll do it meself.

20:29.661 --> 20:32.630
#Yeah #

20:34.533 --> 20:38.401
<i># I tip my hat to the new constitution #</i>

20:38.503 --> 20:40.403
#Take a bow for the new revolution #

20:40.505 --> 20:43.906
Well, Marge, looks like
your insane experiment is over.

20:44.009 --> 20:47.775
My experiment? You're the one
who came up with this whole idea-

20:49.881 --> 20:51.781
#Just like yesterday #

20:51.883 --> 20:56.115
<i># When I get on my knees and pray #</i>

20:57.656 --> 21:01.387
<i># Yeah #</i>

21:05.130 --> 21:08.964
<i># Meet the new boss #</i>

21:09.067 --> 21:11.228
<i># Same as the old boss #</i>

22:08.226 --> 22:11.195
Shh!

22:12.305 --> 22:18.633
