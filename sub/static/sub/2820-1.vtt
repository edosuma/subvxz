01:50.695 --> 01:53.396
- Come on.
- It's gonna hit my head.

02:00.739 --> 02:03.206
I'm scared.

02:24.596 --> 02:25.999
Looks like it's clearing up.

02:26.099 --> 02:27.533
Eric, stop.

02:27.633 --> 02:29.802
- Say mercy.
- Mercy!

02:29.902 --> 02:33.139
That's not how you play.
You go like this.

02:33.239 --> 02:34.941
And then you go like this.

02:35.041 --> 02:36.476
- Okay.
- Yeah.

02:36.576 --> 02:39.909
Oh, no. Say mercy.

02:42.112 --> 02:44.783
Say it. Say mercy.

02:44.883 --> 02:46.018
I'm not gonna.

02:46.118 --> 02:49.052
No, no, no! Okay, mercy, mercy.

03:29.694 --> 03:33.830
- Oh!
- This place is weird.

03:34.099 --> 03:36.535
You can say that again.

03:36.635 --> 03:39.102
Hmm.

03:40.105 --> 03:42.305
Bleh!

03:43.041 --> 03:45.775
Just imagine if you
had to live in here.

03:52.017 --> 03:56.853
- Who do you think lives in here?
- Probably, nobody anymore.

03:57.155 --> 03:59.591
There are holes in the wall.

04:00.191 --> 04:01.824
Yeah, dude.

04:06.131 --> 04:08.200
Whoa!

04:08.300 --> 04:10.600
Guys.

04:16.309 --> 04:18.875
Oh, do you smell that?

04:23.281 --> 04:24.850
It stinks.

04:49.074 --> 04:52.445
- What's with the sound effects?
- Well...

04:52.745 --> 04:54.714
It sounds like a bird falling
from the sky or something.

04:54.814 --> 04:56.515
Yeah, it sounds like a rock,
it doesn't sound like a bird.

04:56.615 --> 04:58.885
Birds are more like this.

04:59.385 --> 05:01.920
Well, maybe a dead
bird sounds like...

05:04.357 --> 05:08.394
What about the last sound effect?
That's like a missile.

05:14.866 --> 05:18.538
<i>Sing all the song of the song
It's the song of the song of the song</i>

05:18.638 --> 05:20.907
<i>With a friend</i>

05:21.007 --> 05:23.243
<i>And the dead bird</i>

05:23.743 --> 05:25.945
<i>I'm a little black
bird an awesome bird</i>

05:26.045 --> 05:27.780
<i>A little black bird</i>

05:27.880 --> 05:31.083
<i>I'm not little my friend and me</i>

05:31.183 --> 05:34.654
<i>The friend and the bird
the friend and the bird</i>

05:34.754 --> 05:38.487
<i>The dead little black bird,
my friend and me</i>

05:40.392 --> 05:43.094
It's like in the walls there's
spiders, like, all over.

05:43.194 --> 05:45.064
Ew!

05:45.164 --> 05:46.832
You're getting spiders on your hand.

05:46.932 --> 05:48.467
No. Don't play with me.

05:50.735 --> 05:52.635
Are you serious?

05:57.075 --> 06:00.142
This is nasty. Just...

06:02.847 --> 06:05.114
Just spiders all over.

06:09.821 --> 06:11.324
Oh, my God.

06:11.424 --> 06:13.890
I'm gonna break through the wall.

06:14.759 --> 06:17.330
Oh, God.

06:18.230 --> 06:20.899
Oh, there's a whole bunch
of spiders in there.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.266
That's nasty.

06:28.073 --> 06:32.041
There's, like, one right there.
Oh, watch your head. There really is.

06:33.945 --> 06:35.715
I killed it for you.
See, I just saved your life.

06:35.815 --> 06:37.880
What would you do without me?

07:12.317 --> 07:15.151
Ian, what is that thing?

08:10.275 --> 08:13.009
Guys, I have to show you something.

08:48.013 --> 08:49.914
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

08:50.014 --> 08:51.814
Guys.

08:54.352 --> 08:56.419
Guys.

08:57.455 --> 08:59.458
You have to promise not
to tell anybody about this.

08:59.558 --> 09:01.791
About what?

09:02.327 --> 09:04.496
Oh!

09:04.596 --> 09:06.662
Cool, right?

09:12.638 --> 09:15.438
Hey, don't. Don't. Give me it.

09:16.374 --> 09:18.441
Come on.

09:22.247 --> 09:25.314
Stop! It's my dad's.

09:29.053 --> 09:31.087
Give me it. Let go.

09:33.391 --> 09:35.895
- Give me the gun.
- Ian!

09:35.995 --> 09:37.363
- Where's it?
- He's coming. Hide it.

09:37.463 --> 09:41.197
Hey! You. Get over here.

09:42.433 --> 09:44.767
Come here, you.

09:47.205 --> 09:49.538
You two, stay there.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.581
Did you take that out of my shed?

09:56.681 --> 09:57.950
Dad, I'm...

09:58.050 --> 10:00.216
Did you load it?

10:00.518 --> 10:02.818
Don't lie to me. Did you load it?

10:05.925 --> 10:09.492
You should know better. You fucking
know you should know better.

10:10.461 --> 10:13.262
Get lost. Go cry in the woods.

10:14.933 --> 10:18.267
You two, get the fuck out of here
and don't say anything to anybody.

10:27.245 --> 10:29.445
Ian!

11:09.220 --> 11:12.091
Justin Jones,
in one minute and 13 seconds

11:12.191 --> 11:14.960
and that will make
the score 15 to 13,

11:15.060 --> 11:17.296
Kittatinny in front of high point.

11:17.396 --> 11:19.365
Franklin Sussex Honda sports beat.

11:19.465 --> 11:22.231
Let's take a commercial time out.

12:01.639 --> 12:04.540
What are you doing? Get out.

12:24.796 --> 12:26.966
- Come on.
- Come on, guys. You got this.

12:27.066 --> 12:28.667
- Connor, put him on the ground.
- Yeah.

12:28.767 --> 12:29.668
- Let's go. Take him down.
- Oh, you suck.

12:29.768 --> 12:32.705
- Come on, Colin.
- Pin him. Come on. Pin him.

12:32.805 --> 12:34.440
- Come on.
- Take him down, go on.

12:34.540 --> 12:35.975
- Take him to his back.
- Colin, fight.

12:36.075 --> 12:37.109
Let's go. Come on.

12:37.209 --> 12:39.745
Come on. Get it over with.

12:39.845 --> 12:42.181
- Come on. Hit him.
- Take him down.

12:42.281 --> 12:44.083
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:44.183 --> 12:46.418
Colin, you suck.

12:46.518 --> 12:47.519
- Who's next?
- Eric and Tristan. Get there.

12:47.619 --> 12:49.755
Let's go. Oh, let's go.

12:49.855 --> 12:52.091
- Tristan, come on, man.
- Come on, take him down.

12:52.191 --> 12:54.193
Come on, Tristan.
Get it over with. Pin him.

12:54.293 --> 12:55.960
Stop backing off.

13:01.099 --> 13:02.467
You gotta get out of that,
you gotta get out of that...

13:03.367 --> 13:04.403
Oh. Nice.

13:04.503 --> 13:05.704
- Good job, Eric.
- There you go.

13:06.604 --> 13:09.938
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

13:12.210 --> 13:14.079
- Let's go. Nice.
- What are you waiting for?

13:14.179 --> 13:16.540
- That was a nice one.
- Come on, go after it.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.748
- You gonna finish it?
- Come on, Chris.

13:25.656 --> 13:27.259
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:27.359 --> 13:29.695
- How are you?
- Great. What can I get you?

13:29.795 --> 13:32.564
A cheeseburger and...

13:32.664 --> 13:34.566
- Do you have lemonade?
- Yes.

13:34.666 --> 13:37.099
- Okay, a large lemonade.
- Okay.

13:42.306 --> 13:45.541
- It's $4.50.
- All right.

13:48.846 --> 13:50.816
There's $5.

13:57.455 --> 13:59.621
Thanks.

14:00.258 --> 14:01.560
Oh. Hey!

14:01.660 --> 14:04.596
What the fuck? I paid for that.

14:04.696 --> 14:06.098
I'll get you another one. Oh.

14:06.198 --> 14:08.797
Um, sorry.

14:56.247 --> 14:58.514
Come on, Eric.

14:58.983 --> 15:00.586
Eric, what are you doing? Come on.

15:00.686 --> 15:02.687
Oh.

15:02.787 --> 15:04.823
Shit.

15:04.923 --> 15:07.022
Isn't that your brother's friend?

16:10.288 --> 16:12.921
I'm sorry.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.798
What's so funny?

16:24.769 --> 16:26.768
Look at your brother.

16:28.005 --> 16:30.239
You look at him.

16:42.820 --> 16:45.020
Are you okay?

16:49.026 --> 16:51.927
Do you wanna talk about Ian, honey?

16:52.697 --> 16:54.796
No.

17:04.541 --> 17:06.775
Can I go to sleep?

17:08.346 --> 17:10.212
Okay.

17:20.458 --> 17:21.759
Do you want me to get the light?

17:21.858 --> 17:24.126
Sure.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.710
Hi, my name is Courtney

18:11.810 --> 18:14.977
and I went to school with
Ian ever since I was little.

18:15.413 --> 18:17.649
Ian was a very nice boy.

18:17.749 --> 18:19.951
He was always there to help.

18:20.051 --> 18:22.421
One day, we were taking a math test

18:22.521 --> 18:26.692
and my pencil broke,
so he gave me his.

18:26.792 --> 18:29.561
Also in gym class once,
we were playing dodgeball

18:29.661 --> 18:31.963
and I got hit in the arm.

18:32.063 --> 18:35.163
He came over just to
make sure I was okay.

18:35.566 --> 18:38.834
I can't remember one time
that he was mean to me.

18:39.904 --> 18:43.408
I miss Ian very much and
I know that his dad

18:43.508 --> 18:47.275
must be really sad right now,
and I hope he feels better soon.

18:51.949 --> 18:56.620
I hope that we all keep,
Ian's dad in our prayers.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.791
And in our hearts.

18:59.891 --> 19:03.959
And I just know that he's going
through a really tough time

19:05.830 --> 19:08.065
I guess it's a...

19:08.165 --> 19:10.766
Hard time for you, right?

19:14.205 --> 19:16.972
Well, you need to know that...

19:18.776 --> 19:20.175
The lord has a plan.

19:23.981 --> 19:27.082
The lord has a plan for Ian.
You know that, right?

19:30.054 --> 19:33.021
- Excuse me?
- He wanted this to happen?

19:33.891 --> 19:35.761
Did I want it to happen?

19:35.861 --> 19:38.460
- He, the lord.
- Oh, the lord.

19:39.096 --> 19:42.731
Well, he works in mysterious ways.

19:46.270 --> 19:51.707
And he has a plan for, bigger than any
of us could ever possibly understand.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.478
And sometimes things happen that...

19:57.114 --> 19:59.781
You know, life's just tough.

20:02.753 --> 20:05.020
No, the lord didn't want him to die.

20:06.257 --> 20:09.028
But he did die.

20:09.128 --> 20:14.095
He guides and protects us all,
so he was protecting Ian.

20:14.532 --> 20:16.067
You need to know that, young man.

20:16.167 --> 20:17.936
God bless you, sir. Good night.

20:18.036 --> 20:19.971
You too, Paul. Thank you
so much for coming.

20:20.071 --> 20:23.038
He's with the lord now, son.
Don't you worry.

21:10.754 --> 21:13.158
- Hi. Um...
- If this dog gets on my property again...

21:13.258 --> 21:15.791
I'll fucking shoot it, okay?

21:23.934 --> 21:27.035
Bad doggy.

22:41.111 --> 22:43.912
Hey, man, wanna go for a ride?

25:34.418 --> 25:37.419
I used to hate it when the
water turned cold all of a sudden.

25:37.955 --> 25:39.891
Because when I was little,

25:39.991 --> 25:42.657
that's where I used to think
all the monsters were.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.535
Do you ever think about dying?

25:51.635 --> 25:53.805
What?

25:53.905 --> 25:58.073
Like dying, someone killing you,
or you killing yourself.

26:00.010 --> 26:02.710
No, not really.

26:07.551 --> 26:09.717
I do.

26:11.288 --> 26:13.390
Why?

26:13.490 --> 26:16.458
I don't know, I just do.

26:17.394 --> 26:19.694
Are you sad?

26:20.964 --> 26:23.301
Yeah, I guess, a little.

26:23.401 --> 26:26.835
You wanna die, because you're sad?

26:36.647 --> 26:38.116
That's dumb.

26:38.216 --> 26:40.882
Ahh! Get off.

27:10.515 --> 27:12.616
Whoa. Tommy, cut it out.

27:12.716 --> 27:14.849
Daisy.

27:16.919 --> 27:18.786
Daisy.

27:19.022 --> 27:20.892
Daisy, what do you have?

27:21.292 --> 27:23.094
Shh! Come here.

27:29.533 --> 27:31.035
Come here, come here.

27:31.135 --> 27:33.201
Holy shit.

27:34.071 --> 27:36.337
Oh, my God.

27:39.142 --> 27:41.912
Tommy, take one of them.

27:43.146 --> 27:44.915
What?

27:45.015 --> 27:46.915
Grab one.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.321
An animal?

27:51.421 --> 27:55.125
Yeah. The cat.

27:55.225 --> 27:57.492
Trust me.

28:10.008 --> 28:13.408
Come on, Daisy.
Let's get out of here.

28:24.321 --> 28:26.454
Ew!

30:08.125 --> 30:11.728
Come on. Come on. Come on.

30:11.828 --> 30:13.998
Come on.

30:20.570 --> 30:23.938
It's okay. It's okay,
come on. Stay in.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.544
It's okay. It's okay.

30:26.644 --> 30:29.010
It's okay, come on.

31:20.197 --> 31:21.833
Damn.

31:22.733 --> 31:27.168
- Do you see something?
- There's a bunny.

31:29.639 --> 31:33.177
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

31:33.277 --> 31:34.910
Let go!

31:35.712 --> 31:37.845
Stop.

31:59.603 --> 32:01.669
Stop.

32:16.286 --> 32:18.820
Do you think you'll die if I shoot?

32:21.691 --> 32:23.758
I don't know.

32:25.328 --> 32:27.030
What if I held it to your head?

32:41.278 --> 32:43.177
Daisy!

32:45.815 --> 32:48.115
Daisy!

32:48.318 --> 32:50.651
Daisy!

32:52.989 --> 32:55.189
Daisy!

33:43.940 --> 33:45.509
- Let's go, Eric.
- Come on, Tristan.

33:45.609 --> 33:47.744
- Come on, go for his legs.
- Come on, Eric.

33:47.844 --> 33:49.547
Trip him.

33:49.647 --> 33:52.450
- Come on, Eric.
- Come on, Eric.

33:52.550 --> 33:53.618
- Come on, Eric.
- Come on, Tristan. Pull it off.

33:53.718 --> 33:56.320
- There you go.
- Come on.

33:56.420 --> 33:58.923
- Bitch, pin him.
- Come on, Tristan. Pin him.

33:59.023 --> 34:00.658
- There you go.
- Come on, Tristan, pin him.

34:00.758 --> 34:04.027
- Who's next?
- Eric, you suck.

34:04.127 --> 34:06.364
Here we go.

34:06.464 --> 34:09.567
- Connor, you got this.
- Come on, Colin, beat his ass.

34:09.667 --> 34:13.000
Go, right here. Come on, Connor.

34:14.904 --> 34:17.206
Connor, don't let him take you down.

34:34.958 --> 34:37.291
You coming in?

34:41.864 --> 34:43.400
Come on, it's not that deep.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.699
I'm fine.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.082
Come on.

35:32.182 --> 35:34.281
I'm okay.

35:34.784 --> 35:36.020
Let's go.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.185
No, Eric. I'm okay.

35:40.023 --> 35:42.890
No. I can swim.

35:44.627 --> 35:46.963
- Let's go.
- No. Eric.

35:47.063 --> 35:48.932
Eric, no.

35:49.032 --> 35:51.836
Eric? Eric! Eric!

35:51.936 --> 35:53.771
Eric, no. Stop.

35:53.871 --> 35:58.239
Eric, stop. Eric. Eric.

35:58.808 --> 35:59.761
It's just water.

35:59.861 --> 36:01.659
- Eric, stop.
- Alright, I'm gonna drop you,

36:01.759 --> 36:03.114
- and you're gonna swim.
- No, I can't swim. I'll drown.

36:03.214 --> 36:04.148
- One...
- Eric, don't do this!

36:04.248 --> 36:05.649
- Two...
- Eric, no.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.848
- Three.
- Eric...

36:10.654 --> 36:12.456
You all right?

36:12.556 --> 36:15.322
See? You're swimming.

36:17.026 --> 36:18.495
Sort of.

36:23.032 --> 36:26.200
This isn't so bad. Hmm?

36:41.518 --> 36:43.851
I just don't wanna be here anymore...

36:44.287 --> 36:46.454
You know?

36:49.626 --> 36:51.726
No one likes me here.

36:53.997 --> 36:56.197
I do.

36:57.767 --> 36:59.436
What?

36:59.536 --> 37:01.502
I do.

37:02.739 --> 37:04.207
You do what?

37:04.307 --> 37:06.176
I like you.

37:06.276 --> 37:07.911
You're my friend.

37:12.115 --> 37:14.148
What's that?

37:16.553 --> 37:18.154
What is what?

37:18.254 --> 37:20.354
That sound.

37:35.905 --> 37:38.973
Don't you ever wish
you were somewhere else?

37:40.977 --> 37:43.112
I don't know.

37:43.212 --> 37:46.080
I don't think so.

37:46.883 --> 37:49.550
Tristan, this is so dumb.

37:54.324 --> 37:56.423
I hate it here.

37:59.963 --> 38:02.062
You're my friend.

38:05.935 --> 38:08.068
I don't know.

38:12.242 --> 38:14.508
I gotta go, Eric.

38:17.246 --> 38:19.380
Bye, Eric.

38:41.104 --> 38:44.205
So you don't wonder
what it feels like?

38:45.408 --> 38:47.975
Well, sometimes I do.

38:48.211 --> 38:50.377
What about you?

38:52.315 --> 38:53.951
I guess so.

38:54.051 --> 38:56.417
I mean, yeah.

39:01.658 --> 39:03.624
Why do you think of this stuff?

39:05.662 --> 39:07.331
I don't know. It's just...

39:07.431 --> 39:09.864
It comes into my mind.

39:16.439 --> 39:18.572
Hmm.

39:21.344 --> 39:23.577
Hold on.

39:23.980 --> 39:26.146
What are you doing?

39:30.453 --> 39:32.620
What are you doing?

39:36.392 --> 39:38.094
Dude, what are you doing?

39:38.194 --> 39:39.663
See?

39:39.763 --> 39:41.662
We don't even have to touch.

39:46.869 --> 39:49.136
This is weird.

39:53.876 --> 39:55.379
It's not weird.

39:55.479 --> 39:58.012
It's pretty weird.

40:09.258 --> 40:11.325
Ready?

40:13.496 --> 40:15.963
Fine.

40:20.937 --> 40:22.006
It felt so weird.

40:22.106 --> 40:23.938
I didn't feel anything.

40:26.909 --> 40:29.176
Wanna try again?

40:30.179 --> 40:32.246
Fine.

40:35.384 --> 40:38.285
Eew. Oh, my God.

41:08.217 --> 41:10.617
Hey, guys. Hi, Eric.

41:11.087 --> 41:14.555
- Hey. How are you?
- Good. How are you?

41:14.791 --> 41:16.657
- Good.
- Good.

41:16.959 --> 41:19.363
You know, it's been hard

41:19.463 --> 41:21.899
- but we're getting there, I think.
- Yeah.

41:21.999 --> 41:24.101
Back to normal. How about you guys?

41:24.201 --> 41:25.702
Same.

41:25.802 --> 41:28.168
I couldn't do it.

41:28.938 --> 41:31.271
I wish I had someone to do it for me.

41:34.577 --> 41:37.414
Oh, Jesus! God!

41:37.514 --> 41:40.581
Eric. Excuse me.

41:42.318 --> 41:44.785
I'm so sorry.

42:35.638 --> 42:37.506
Daisy?

43:11.140 --> 43:13.109
Eric.

43:13.209 --> 43:15.275
Look.

43:19.081 --> 43:21.215
Why is she on this?

43:24.387 --> 43:27.354
I found her like that,
tied up on the street.

43:36.032 --> 43:37.831
Let's go.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.527
Eric?

44:10.199 --> 44:12.499
Eric!

47:29.598 --> 47:31.832
Are you alright?

47:37.373 --> 47:39.573
What's wrong with you?

47:41.477 --> 47:43.477
Let's go.

47:45.915 --> 47:47.416
Come on!

47:47.516 --> 47:49.750
Hold on.

48:03.432 --> 48:05.932
Oh, man, this is just...

48:07.770 --> 48:10.036
There we go.

48:29.992 --> 48:32.492
Okay, I'm gonna give
you some of this.

48:46.642 --> 48:48.708
You want some help, honey?

48:55.517 --> 48:56.520
What's the matter?

48:56.620 --> 48:58.155
What?

48:58.255 --> 48:59.922
What's wrong?

49:00.022 --> 49:02.556
It's just a stomach ache.

49:03.993 --> 49:06.893
Hmm. You're not gonna eat?

49:24.580 --> 49:26.582
What's wrong with your arm?

49:26.682 --> 49:28.849
It's fine.

49:31.987 --> 49:33.856
Why aren't you using it?

49:33.956 --> 49:36.256
Stop.

49:36.792 --> 49:38.295
Just let me see it.

49:38.395 --> 49:39.993
What's going on, guys?

49:42.031 --> 49:44.598
I hate it here.

49:45.434 --> 49:48.134
That's very nice.
Thank you very much.

49:48.504 --> 49:50.737
I do. You guys don't care.

49:52.375 --> 49:54.444
You know what, Eric?
That's bullshit.

49:54.544 --> 49:56.810
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

50:03.552 --> 50:05.654
Really?

50:05.754 --> 50:06.856
Why do you even care?

50:08.525 --> 50:11.558
'Cause I'm your father.
I'm your dad, okay?

50:11.694 --> 50:15.061
Something happens to your hand
and I don't know what happened?

50:28.644 --> 50:30.911
He's just doing that
to get attention.

50:37.986 --> 50:39.722
Hey, Tommy.

50:39.822 --> 50:42.291
The way he acts...

50:42.391 --> 50:45.327
that's not you, okay?

50:45.427 --> 50:47.694
Okay.

51:15.090 --> 51:17.190
Hey, get up.

51:23.832 --> 51:25.435
What?

51:25.535 --> 51:27.367
Get dressed. Come on.

51:28.670 --> 51:30.540
Why?

51:30.640 --> 51:32.939
It'll be fun, just come on.

51:35.611 --> 51:36.746
No.

51:36.846 --> 51:39.245
Fuck you. Come on.

51:42.451 --> 51:45.719
Get dressed and meet me outside.
And bring some food, okay?

53:05.501 --> 53:07.267
Hey, Tommy!

53:07.970 --> 53:10.704
Come here. I wanna
show you something.

53:16.879 --> 53:19.079
Look.

53:23.185 --> 53:25.819
It's for Ian.

53:25.921 --> 53:28.088
Yeah.

53:30.893 --> 53:32.859
What are you thinking about?

53:35.531 --> 53:37.363
I don't know.

54:09.932 --> 54:12.132
What's wrong?

54:15.037 --> 54:17.137
Nothing.

54:18.206 --> 54:20.406
You've been here before.

54:21.710 --> 54:23.409
You don't remember?

54:25.113 --> 54:29.315
There used to be train tracks here
but they don't use them anymore.

54:31.887 --> 54:33.989
It's kind of scary.

54:34.089 --> 54:36.222
Yeah.

54:37.025 --> 54:39.492
You don't have to go in,
if you don't want to.

54:46.735 --> 54:48.670
No, I want to.

54:48.770 --> 54:50.904
Okay.

55:23.138 --> 55:25.205
Eric?

55:32.447 --> 55:35.152
Eric no. Eric, stop.

55:35.252 --> 55:36.953
- Eric! Really!
- You're gonna go over!

55:37.053 --> 55:38.688
- I'm gonna push you!
- Eric, no!

55:38.788 --> 55:41.657
Eric, stop! Eric, really!

55:41.757 --> 55:43.957
Okay. Okay.

55:44.860 --> 55:47.493
It was just a joke. Calm down.

55:49.793 --> 55:51.993
I'm sorry.

55:53.669 --> 55:55.902
Why would you do that?

56:02.477 --> 56:05.782
It was just a joke. It... I didn't...

56:05.882 --> 56:08.214
I didn't think you were
gonna care that much.

56:26.268 --> 56:27.336
I'm hungry.

56:27.436 --> 56:29.569
No.

56:30.372 --> 56:31.608
What?

56:31.708 --> 56:33.573
What is this?

56:43.285 --> 56:45.320
It's...

56:45.420 --> 56:47.453
Why?

56:50.325 --> 56:53.059
Well, it's Ian's dad's.

56:54.896 --> 56:57.165
I took it cause I thought
he might want it.

56:57.265 --> 56:59.267
And...

56:59.367 --> 57:02.168
I'll throw it away someplace.

57:40.475 --> 57:42.078
It's rotten.

57:42.178 --> 57:44.243
Why are you burning it?

57:46.815 --> 57:48.817
No. No. No. Shit.

57:48.917 --> 57:51.351
Shit.

57:52.854 --> 57:55.221
God damn it.

58:14.409 --> 58:16.376
Have you ever thought about jumping?

58:18.880 --> 58:20.716
Yeah.

58:20.816 --> 58:22.150
A little.

58:22.250 --> 58:25.551
But I never would.

58:38.300 --> 58:40.400
What are you doing?

58:41.203 --> 58:43.603
I'm making a grave.

58:44.072 --> 58:45.841
For what?

58:45.941 --> 58:48.074
For the raccoon.

58:52.047 --> 58:54.113
Do you want to say something?

58:58.520 --> 59:00.720
It's kind of what people usually do.

59:04.025 --> 59:06.325
Okay.

59:14.636 --> 59:17.070
Dear raccoon,

59:17.639 --> 59:19.839
I'm sorry you died.

59:20.041 --> 59:23.242
And I'm sorry that my brother
burned you after you died.

59:27.015 --> 59:29.482
I hope you come back
as a better animal

59:30.118 --> 59:34.587
unless you liked being a raccoon,
then I hope you come back as that.

59:35.223 --> 59:36.424
Amen.

59:36.524 --> 59:38.724
Oh.

59:42.964 --> 59:45.198
Here.

59:51.907 --> 59:53.739
What if I roll off?

59:54.009 --> 59:55.544
You're not gonna roll off.

59:55.644 --> 59:57.777
I roll in my sleep.

59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.481
I'll hold you.

01:00:42.691 --> 01:00:44.724
Missed.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.393
It's all up to me.

01:00:53.735 --> 01:00:56.202
Wow.

01:00:57.739 --> 01:01:00.273
- Oh!
- Stupid.

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:19.692
What did he look like
when he fell... I guess?

01:01:23.198 --> 01:01:25.431
He, uh...

01:01:25.734 --> 01:01:28.501
He looked like Ian.

01:01:36.011 --> 01:01:38.377
Was he happy?

01:01:40.548 --> 01:01:42.782
I don't know.

01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:44.984
How was he before he died?

01:01:49.224 --> 01:01:50.923
He was mostly happy.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.461
That's what he looked like.
He looked happy.

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:10.643
Do you think he jumped?

01:02:14.082 --> 01:02:16.415
Who said he jumped?

01:02:18.787 --> 01:02:21.020
I don't know, people.

01:02:23.124 --> 01:02:25.825
You know, he... He could have fallen.

01:02:27.629 --> 01:02:29.996
Just playing around like a kid.

01:02:30.565 --> 01:02:32.765
Slipped.

01:02:37.338 --> 01:02:39.038
Do you think mom will get mad at us?

01:02:41.509 --> 01:02:43.676
I don't know. Who cares, man?

01:02:44.245 --> 01:02:46.279
Who cares what she thinks?

01:02:53.188 --> 01:02:55.354
Do you think it hurt?

01:02:56.558 --> 01:02:58.724
I don't know.

01:03:08.603 --> 01:03:10.736
I'm sorry.

01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:28.554
I'm sorry, man.

01:03:29.157 --> 01:03:30.692
You're my friend.

01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:33.059
Okay?

01:03:33.394 --> 01:03:35.428
Don't forget it.

01:05:49.597 --> 01:05:51.697
It's okay, Daisy.

01:05:54.035 --> 01:05:56.569
It's okay.

01:05:57.405 --> 01:05:58.741
It's okay.

01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:01.140
It's okay, I got you.

01:06:01.376 --> 01:06:03.242
I won't let you go.

01:06:14.289 --> 01:06:15.624
It's okay, Daisy.

01:06:15.724 --> 01:06:18.624
I got you.

01:06:18.926 --> 01:06:20.993
I got you, Daisy.

01:06:21.963 --> 01:06:24.196
Okay, Daisy.

01:06:24.732 --> 01:06:26.502
I'm gonna count to three

01:06:26.602 --> 01:06:29.602
and I'm gonna let go and
you're gonna swim, okay?

01:06:30.305 --> 01:06:32.171
Three...

01:06:32.707 --> 01:06:36.609
One, two, three.

01:07:04.872 --> 01:07:06.508
Knock him down, Tommy.

01:07:06.608 --> 01:07:09.912
Come on, Tommy. Take him down.
Come on, Tommy. In the circle.

01:07:10.012 --> 01:07:11.879
- Go, Tommy.
- Get him down already.

01:07:15.717 --> 01:07:17.816
Come on.

01:07:20.521 --> 01:07:23.088
Come on, Tommy. Let's go.

01:07:24.492 --> 01:07:26.859
Tommy, go. Come on, Tommy.

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:31.597
- Let's go.
- Go!

01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:38.270
- Nice job, old man!
- Nice, Tommy.

01:07:40.408 --> 01:07:42.308
Me and you, come on.

01:07:44.879 --> 01:07:46.515
- Eric, come on. Go Eric.
- Come on, Eric.

01:07:46.615 --> 01:07:47.949
Come on, Tristan.

01:07:53.588 --> 01:07:55.491
Get back in.
Come on, Eric. Get up.

01:07:55.591 --> 01:07:58.123
Let's go. Eric.

01:08:01.964 --> 01:08:04.300
Let's go, Eric. Get his legs.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.834
Oh, shit.

01:08:18.513 --> 01:08:20.648
Damn, man.

01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:22.649
Come on, Eric.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.883
Eric?

01:08:32.026 --> 01:08:34.727
Oh! Dude.

01:08:35.462 --> 01:08:37.363
- Yo, Tristan, watch out!
- Hey!

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.299
You fucking psycho!

01:14:20.941 --> 01:14:22.708
I'm sorry.
