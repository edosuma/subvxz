00:01.901 --> 00:06.270
<i>Oh! What a day! Huh, Mark?</i>

00:06.373 --> 00:09.536
Mark. Mark!

00:12.645 --> 00:14.306
Mark, what are you listening to?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.783
"Pus and Boots"?

00:18.585 --> 00:21.349
<i>With their new hit single,
Smell the Hell.</i>

00:22.655 --> 00:25.180
You gotta be kidding. Nice lyrics.

00:25.258 --> 00:28.227
"I hate you. You're garbage.

00:28.294 --> 00:30.626
I'm puking. You're garbage."

00:31.531 --> 00:34.694
Which reminds me,
you forgot to take out the garbage.

00:36.669 --> 00:38.159
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.138
Hi, guys.

00:40.206 --> 00:44.370
Look at this. Brad got a letter
from the University of North Carolina.

00:44.444 --> 00:48.210
<i>Here's an uplifting tune:
I Feel the Fungus.</i>

00:50.350 --> 00:52.375
It's from North Carolina.

00:55.455 --> 00:58.424
This is that scout
that was at practice the other day.

00:58.525 --> 01:01.016
He says he's looking at me
for a soccer scholarship.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.552
University of North Carolina?
That's not in Michigan.

01:07.867 --> 01:10.700
I have a chance at playing
for the Tar Heels. Awesome!

01:10.770 --> 01:12.704
- Awesome. All right!
- Yeah.

01:12.772 --> 01:17.300
This is great! Now remember though,
you have two more years of school.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.140
Keep that grade-point average up.

01:19.245 --> 01:23.113
That's right. It's like when those
technical schools were romancing me,

01:23.183 --> 01:25.276
I didn't want to let my grades go down.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.249
They couldn't go down.

01:31.224 --> 01:34.921
I'm gonna work harder than ever.
I've got something to shoot for.

01:34.994 --> 01:37.554
- Congratulations.
- I'm gonna call Jason.

01:37.664 --> 01:40.098
A scholarship.
Do you know what that would mean?

01:40.166 --> 01:42.259
He's gonna get a great education.

01:42.335 --> 01:44.997
Oh, yeah!

01:45.071 --> 01:49.838
But with the money we'd save,
I could start another hot rod.

01:49.909 --> 01:52.742
Tim, if Brad is lucky enough
to get a scholarship,

01:52.812 --> 01:56.339
we're not gonna be buying any cars.
We have two more kids times four more

01:56.416 --> 01:58.441
years of college. You do the math.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.850
I married you so I wouldn't
have to do the math.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074

02:55.575 --> 02:59.671
Hello?
It's Cathy and Greg.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.680
Oh, no. No.

03:01.748 --> 03:03.909
Hi.

03:03.983 --> 03:07.441
Uh... oh, you want to
get together next Friday?

03:07.520 --> 03:10.887
- No, no, no.
- No, we can't. We're busy.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.314
What are we busy doing?

03:13.960 --> 03:16.394
We're, uh, sawing wood.

03:18.798 --> 03:20.527
Dinner, Randy. Dinner.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.568
We're sawing wood for dinner.

03:22.669 --> 03:26.969
You see, we make a table,
then we eat off it. Yeah.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.270
No, no, no. We'll let you know
when we're free.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.708
OK. Bye-bye.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.042
- That was close.
- Yeah.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.673
Why are you trying
to avoid these people?

03:36.783 --> 03:39.946
Cathy Simms and Greg Clark,
the most annoying kids at school.

03:40.019 --> 03:43.250
They're like a married couple.
Since they heard we were together,

03:43.323 --> 03:45.291
they've been bugging us to double-date.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.881
I think they smell our fear.

03:50.296 --> 03:53.026
Randy, it's not
really nice to duck people.

03:53.099 --> 03:57.195
Oh, well, you would know, being one
of the all-time great couple-duckers.

03:58.204 --> 04:01.571
- Me? I am not a couple-ducker.
- Oh, come on, Mom!

04:01.674 --> 04:04.404
The Goodmans? For a month
we couldn't turn on our lights

04:04.477 --> 04:07.412
so they wouldn't know
we were back from vacation.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.846
We don't know what to do.
We're desperate.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.417
Now, I don't really condone this.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.613
But if you have to avoid somebody,
here's what you do.

04:15.688 --> 04:20.648
Whenever they want to get together,
be agreeable but vague.

04:20.726 --> 04:25.096
Use phrases like, uh, "after the
holidays" or "when things settle down."

04:25.164 --> 04:27.132
Oh, if you run into them unexpectedly,

04:27.200 --> 04:30.067
be sure that you have some emergency
you have to deal with.

04:30.136 --> 04:32.969
This family, you don't even
have to make that up.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.731
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.708
- You ready to go to the mall?
- Sure.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.713
- Oh, when are you guys gonna be back?
- Oh, you know, when things settle down.

04:47.020 --> 04:50.456
Honey, you should've seen Brad
at soccer practice. He was incredible!

04:50.523 --> 04:52.457
- I was the bomb!
- No, you were the man!

04:52.525 --> 04:55.289
- I'm the man! Ooh!
- Hey! Ow!

04:56.896 --> 04:59.126
Chest bumping.

04:59.198 --> 05:01.894
Something you'd never see two women do.

05:03.903 --> 05:06.269
I'd pay a lot of money
to see it though.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.841
Yeah. Coach Martino
seemed pretty excited

05:11.911 --> 05:14.402
- about that letter.
- We're all excited about it.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.040
But remember what he said.
They send out 300 letters,

05:17.116 --> 05:19.209
but only five kids get the scholarships.

05:19.285 --> 05:21.947
How do I make sure
I'm one of those five?

05:22.021 --> 05:25.115
Come on. You gotta
work harder than the other 295.

05:25.191 --> 05:29.855
- Pay attention to your trainer.
- I don't have a personal trainer.

05:29.929 --> 05:32.295
You do now. Drop and give me 20.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.768
Blow it out!
Seventeen! Come on! Eighteen!

05:36.836 --> 05:40.294
Push it! Nineteen!
Good! Twenty. Lock it up.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.534
Put another plate on.
One more set! Come on!

05:42.608 --> 05:46.135
- Dad, another set? I'm kind of tired.
- Tired? Look, we've got a goal.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.737
We've gotta do everything we can.
What do we want?

05:48.815 --> 05:51.283
- Scholarship.
- How are we gonna get it?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.046
- Hard work.
- I can't hear you!

05:53.119 --> 05:54.381
- Hard work!
- Can't hear!

05:54.454 --> 05:56.115
- Hard work!
- I can't hear you!

05:56.189 --> 05:57.884
I heard you!

06:00.560 --> 06:02.790
Does everybody know what time it is?

06:02.862 --> 06:05.797
<i>- Tool Time!
- That's right!</i>

06:05.865 --> 06:11.735
Binford Tools is proud to present
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor! Whoo!

06:17.877 --> 06:19.606
Thank you.

06:19.679 --> 06:22.648
Thank you, everybody.
Thanks for coming. Thank you, Heidi.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.616
Thank you, Heidi. Thank you, Heidi!

06:30.456 --> 06:34.415
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.</i>

06:34.494 --> 06:37.019
And of course you all
know my assistant, Al Borland.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.336
<i>Well, today Al and I join you
for our Tool Time salute...</i>

06:44.404 --> 06:45.769
Oi! My back!

06:45.872 --> 06:46.896
...to fitness.

06:48.775 --> 06:52.541
And who better to help us out than
those lean, mean construction machines

06:52.645 --> 06:55.614
from Bay City? The boys from
K&B Construction! Bring 'em out!

06:55.681 --> 06:58.115
Let's hear it
for Rock, Pete and Dwayne!

06:58.184 --> 07:00.448
Hey! Hey, buddy!

07:00.520 --> 07:02.545
- All right!
- How are you, buddy?

07:02.622 --> 07:04.351
All right.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.088
- It's good to see you.
- Always great to be here, Timmy.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.652
All right.
What do you guys do to stay in shape?

07:10.730 --> 07:15.292
Well, not as much
as you might think, Tim.

07:15.401 --> 07:19.565
Pete's idea of a workout
is the old one-armed doughnut curl.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.808
Is, um, fitness a big deal
at K&B Construction?

07:23.876 --> 07:28.245
Ah, it's job one, Timmy.
According to researchers at K&B R and D,

07:28.314 --> 07:31.943
being in shape can help
prevent injuries at the workplace.

07:32.018 --> 07:35.647
The only way I can prevent injuries in
our workplace is if Tim calls in sick.

07:35.721 --> 07:38.884
That's a good one, Al!

07:39.759 --> 07:44.787
You know, Tim, studies have shown that
hammering or any repetitive movement

07:44.864 --> 07:48.630
with the hand can
cause carpal tunnel syndrome.

07:48.734 --> 07:52.500
To prevent this, my exercise program
goes something like this.

07:58.277 --> 08:03.772
Be sure to consult a physician before
starting a strenuous exercise program.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.578
Rock, what do you do to stay in shape?

08:07.653 --> 08:10.520
Well, during lunch breaks,
I teach Jazzercise.

08:15.761 --> 08:18.696
That doesn't sound too manly, Rock.

08:18.764 --> 08:22.530
We do it 80 stories up
on a steel girder.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.001
Well, that'll put wind
in your leotard.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.906
Speaking of leotards,
it's time to introduce our guest,

08:28.975 --> 08:31.000
a professional bodybuilder.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.841
Not just a professional,
a three-time world champion.

08:33.946 --> 08:35.880
Here at Cobo Hall at the fitness show.

08:35.948 --> 08:39.008
Heidi, my bodybuilder, please.
Miss Cory Everson!

08:44.590 --> 08:46.683
Ah, it's very good
to have you on the show.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.727
- Thank you.
- Cory's here to show us how

08:48.794 --> 08:51.957
- to prevent injuries at work.
- Yes. One of the leading injuries

08:52.031 --> 08:54.090
in the workplace
is injury to the low back,

08:54.166 --> 08:57.465
because you're using improper
mechanics. Proper body mechanics.

08:57.537 --> 09:02.099
Use your legs to lift, not your back.
And never rotate and torque your spine.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.404
That's what happened.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.639
There's some men
that probably don't think

09:07.747 --> 09:11.046
women can lift the iron with the men,
you know? I'm not one of them.

09:11.117 --> 09:14.780
But just for the sake of argument,
do you want to go mano to womano?

09:14.854 --> 09:17.220
You want to compete against me?

09:17.323 --> 09:21.419
- Yeah.
- You do know I'm a professional?

09:21.494 --> 09:25.362
I could've gone pro. I wanted to keep
my eligibility open for the Olympics.

09:26.933 --> 09:30.699
What event was that? Synchronized
Gluing a Board to Your Head?

09:30.803 --> 09:34.261
I remember that! Yeah!

09:36.342 --> 09:39.903
Do you guys wonder why it's been three
years since I've had you on the show?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.246
- Let's get to it.
- Tim, she looks pretty strong.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.546
I think she could bench press us.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.144
And, by the way, anytime.

09:48.955 --> 09:52.118
OK, let's try a nice light weight.
Let's say 130 pounds.

09:52.224 --> 09:55.751
- OK, looks good to me.
- Use your legs.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.796
Come on, Timbo.

09:57.863 --> 10:00.923
Oh!

10:02.268 --> 10:05.101
- Yeah!
- All right, Timmy!

10:09.976 --> 10:11.876
Your turn, Cory.

10:29.762 --> 10:32.629
- What was that?
- What was what?

10:39.805 --> 10:42.103
Maybe you're not as strong
as you thought.

10:42.174 --> 10:45.143
Just hold on a second.
I just need a better grip.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.753
Maybe you need the help
of a big strong man?

11:09.969 --> 11:13.496
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Yeah!

11:13.572 --> 11:17.531
You shaved two seconds off your last
try. Now some ball-handling. All right?

11:17.643 --> 11:20.271
Use your eyes.
Use your eyes. Come on.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.611
- Yeah, yeah!
- Brad, it's Friday night.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.617
Wouldrt you rather be out having fun?

11:25.685 --> 11:29.177
No, Mom. Can't have fun.
Dad says I need work on my ball control.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.621
I'm gonna keep doing it
so I can score more goals.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.558
This kid's gonna
be a superstar, right, honey?

11:34.627 --> 11:37.118
- I guess so.
- I can't hear you!

11:38.230 --> 11:40.698
Tim, come inside.
I want to talk to you for a minute.

11:40.766 --> 11:43.291
- Don't slow down. I'll be right back.
- All right.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.828
Don't you think you're
being a little hard on him?

11:47.907 --> 11:50.467
He loves this stuff.
Keep your knees up!

11:50.576 --> 11:53.443
Soccer has been fun.
I don't want you working him to death

11:53.512 --> 11:55.139
and turning it into a chore.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.115
This is the difference
between you and me.

11:58.184 --> 12:01.847
You look at the glass, you say it's half
empty. I look at the glass and I say...

12:05.958 --> 12:07.585
...it's broken.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.028
Hi, sweetie.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.862
Mom, can you open this can?
My nails are still wet.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.528
Why did you paint your nails black?

12:20.606 --> 12:22.733
Why did you paint yours pink?

12:24.510 --> 12:27.070
Oh, OK. OK.

12:27.179 --> 12:30.342
I get it. I get it.
You're trying to express yourself.

12:30.449 --> 12:33.612
It's just part of growing up.
I think it's really cool.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.780
Yeah, in fact, you know what?
I think they look great.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.994
God help me!

12:46.365 --> 12:48.697
- Hi, guys. How's it going?
- Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

12:48.768 --> 12:53.102
Hey. Terrible. The couple we've been
avoiding cornered us after school.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.936
Yeah. We got a double-date
with Cathy and Greg tonight.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.100
What happened to the excuses I gave you?

12:58.177 --> 13:02.841
Shot down one by one. I should've
asked Dad how he ducks people.

13:02.915 --> 13:06.407
He doesn't have to worry about it.
He's the one people are ducking.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.353
Sorry I'm late.
Got hung up at work.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.549
We can catch
the second half of the game.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.321
- OK, I'm ready.
- Look what I had made.

13:15.394 --> 13:18.727
- "Goal Brad Goal."
- Hey.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.959
If your kid's a winner,
you gotta flaunt it.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.931
Right.

13:23.836 --> 13:27.169
- What are you doing home?
- Coach kicked me off the team.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.874
Why did the coach
kick you off the team?

13:33.946 --> 13:36.710
- I told him off when he benched me.
- Why did he bench you?

13:36.782 --> 13:39.945
More importantly,
who are you to tell your coach off?

13:40.052 --> 13:42.680
Mom, we were up
six to nothing thanks to me.

13:42.755 --> 13:46.020
Then our coach gets this idea
he should put in the crappy players.

13:46.091 --> 13:50.323
- The crappy players?
- I'm just trying to build up my stats.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.523
I had three goals
and it wasrt half-time.

13:52.598 --> 13:57.433
I don't care if you had three...
Three goals at half-time?

13:57.503 --> 14:00.734
I don't care if you had 600 goals.
The coach runs the team, Brad.

14:00.806 --> 14:03.240
The coach wouldn't
have a team without me.

14:03.309 --> 14:07.177
Me, me, me, me, me! When did you
become the center of your own universe?

14:07.246 --> 14:09.544
Why don't you ask your shirt?

14:13.452 --> 14:15.283
Shirts don't talk.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.652
Dad, we've worked so hard for this.
You gotta talk some sense into my coach.

14:20.726 --> 14:22.591
No way your father's going in to talk.

14:22.661 --> 14:24.526
- I'll talk to his coach.
- Thank you.

14:24.597 --> 14:27.862
I'll tell him my kid was wrong.
He deserves to be kicked off the team.

14:28.901 --> 14:31.233
- Now you're bailing.
- No. Don't start this.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.600
- I see how it is.
- Hold on.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.799
I thought we were in this together.
You know what? I was wrong.

14:38.244 --> 14:39.541
What is with him?

14:39.612 --> 14:42.581
Where did he get the idea I'd
approve of him disobeying coach?

14:42.681 --> 14:46.777
I don't know. Maybe it had something
to do with "Brad, you're awesome."

14:46.852 --> 14:50.515
"Brad, you're the bomb."
"I can't hear you!"

14:53.259 --> 14:55.819
Oh! You're blaming this on me?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.921
I'm not just blaming you.
I blame every man who thinks sports

14:58.998 --> 15:03.332
are the only thing that matters. I blame
the press for writing about winners.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.428
The networks for making
every game seem like life and death.

15:06.505 --> 15:10.874
I blame the advertisers who only care
about selling beer and $200 sneakers.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.244
You're a rather angry woman, aren't you?

15:17.583 --> 15:22.486
Seventeen, 18, 19...

15:24.490 --> 15:26.754
Easy there, neighbor.

15:27.960 --> 15:32.329
You might end up herniating your nucleus
pulposus and end up with articulopathy.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.526
- What?
- A pain in your butt.

15:36.635 --> 15:39.399
Is your
yoga class over, Wilson?

15:39.471 --> 15:42.406
Yeah. Thought I might continue on
with weight training.

15:42.474 --> 15:45.204
You know, firm and toned.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.404
Why don't you try
covered and hidden? Yah!

15:47.479 --> 15:52.143
So where's Brad?
I thought you were training him.

15:52.217 --> 15:56.586
I was. He got kicked off the soccer team
for mouthing off at the coach.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.590
I wonder if I'm putting
too much pressure on him.

15:59.658 --> 16:02.320
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

16:02.394 --> 16:05.727
You know, Tim, my father and I went
through the same thing together.

16:05.798 --> 16:10.360
- You played soccer?
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Bagpipes.

16:11.370 --> 16:14.464
You know, I was quite a prodigy,
but my father used to pressure me

16:14.540 --> 16:16.804
to practice five hours a day.

16:16.875 --> 16:20.003
And that pressure brought on
one of the darkest days of my life.

16:20.079 --> 16:23.913
Tim, at the Saint Patrick's Day Parade,
I showboated.

16:23.983 --> 16:28.352
Without shame, I drowned out
the entire All-City Leprechaun Choir.

16:31.857 --> 16:34.951
- That reminds me of the time...
- Tim, we're talking about me.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.357
Sorry.

16:37.429 --> 16:41.866
My father realized that his badgering
was partly the cause of my behavior.

16:41.934 --> 16:45.370
- What did he do about it?
- Well, he lightened up.

16:45.437 --> 16:49.396
Said, "Do your best. If you're not the
greatest bagpipe player in the world,

16:49.508 --> 16:53.842
it's OK." Oh, Tim, I felt
so much better. I sat right down.

16:53.912 --> 16:57.075
I wrote a letter of apology
to each and every leprechaun.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.953
Wow. Did you have
to write really, really tiny?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.182
No, Tim. I didn't.

17:09.161 --> 17:12.324
<i>Up against the wall, punk.
And spread 'em!</i>

17:14.465 --> 17:16.194
Very funny, Dad.

17:16.902 --> 17:19.871
Turn that thing off for a minute.
I want to talk to you.

17:19.938 --> 17:22.634
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Yeah, there is.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.472
I want to talk about teamwork.

17:25.577 --> 17:29.741
Um, you know Barry Sanders,
one of the greatest running backs alive.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.908
Not much without his offensive line.

17:31.984 --> 17:35.317
Michael Andretti, great driver.
Not much without his pit crew.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.720
Michael Jordan... Bad example. Um...

17:40.059 --> 17:43.153
I know what you're trying to say.
It's too late. I'm off the team.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.720
Listen for a minute. The reason
I wanted the scholarship so bad for you

17:46.799 --> 17:49.859
is because you have
great athletic ability.

17:49.935 --> 17:52.563
You know, I never played sports
when I was your age.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.129
Yeah, I know.
Grandma says you stunk.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.535
It wasrt because I stunk.
I wasrt interested in sports.

17:59.611 --> 18:02.079
Said you couldn't catch a ball
to save your life.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.206
- It wasrt because...
- Two left feet.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.751
Let me tell you something about Grandma.

18:06.819 --> 18:10.380
Grandma, great! What a role model!
Threw like a girl all the time!

18:10.456 --> 18:13.323
And oh, oh, oh! It was always
passed-down clothes for me!

18:13.392 --> 18:15.917
You try playing football
in tap shoes! Try that!

18:15.994 --> 18:17.757
Dad! Dad!

18:17.863 --> 18:19.763
- Let's forget about Grandma!
- Yeah.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.130
Her cube steak
and stewed tomato dinner...

18:22.201 --> 18:25.864
Going out to football games I
couldn't even think, I had so much gas!

18:26.939 --> 18:28.770
OK. OK.

18:33.545 --> 18:36.912
The reason I wanted you to do this
is because you're good at soccer.

18:36.982 --> 18:38.950
I wanted you
to realize your potential.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.815
- That's what I want.
- But none of that will happen

18:41.887 --> 18:44.856
unless you show good judgment
and respect for other people.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.518
- So I guess I blew it.
- No. We both blew it.

18:48.594 --> 18:52.826
I got too excited about this scholarship
and I put too much pressure on you.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.024
- So what do we do now?
- What do we do now?

18:56.101 --> 19:00.333
- I say we talk to your coach.
- What if he doesn't take me back?

19:00.405 --> 19:04.102
I think he will. You gotta apologize.
I do a little explaining. Huh?

19:04.176 --> 19:08.340
- Thanks, Dad.
- You bet. If it doesn't work out,

19:08.413 --> 19:11.780
I know a guy that can set you up
with a bagpipe scholarship.

19:16.455 --> 19:20.221
It's just really great that you guys
finally found the time to get together

19:20.325 --> 19:23.954
- with Greg and me.
- You're not an easy couple to pin down.

19:24.029 --> 19:28.261
And yet you managed to catch us.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.366
So how's your double-date going?

19:31.436 --> 19:35.372
Remember how I told you Cathy and Greg
were the most annoying people in school?

19:35.440 --> 19:38.068
- Uh-huh.
- They're the most annoying on Earth.

19:39.111 --> 19:43.138
Cathy and I can't wait to go bowling
with you guys. I have a 180 average.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.651
- Oh, Greg. You're so showy.
- I'm not showy.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.447
She always brings this up.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.748
- I do not.
- Please!

19:49.821 --> 19:52.449
Last Thursday night
with Dan and Irene? What was that?

19:52.524 --> 19:54.287
You know what?
Don't start with me.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.691
- You started with me.
- This is a nightmare.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.196
Well, look at the bright side.

19:59.264 --> 20:02.756
The bowling alley closes
in five-and-a-half hours.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.997
- Let's go bowling!
- This is it. We're sunk.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.703
So I'm ready to go bowling.
How about you guys?

20:09.808 --> 20:10.968
You're coming with us?

20:11.043 --> 20:14.945
Oh, I always go on all of Randy's dates.
A boy needs his mother.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.442
- That's right.
- Lauren, you're OK with this?

20:21.520 --> 20:24.887
Yeah, I think it's great.

20:24.990 --> 20:28.756
You know, on really special occasions,
his grandmother comes too.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.786
Just me and my women.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.262
- I realized I can't go bowling.
- You can't?

20:36.335 --> 20:39.270
- I forgot my shoe inserts.
- Oh!

20:39.338 --> 20:41.499
- We should do this another time.
- Yeah.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.370
Sometime after the holidays.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.807
- When things settle down.
- I'll call you.

20:45.877 --> 20:46.844
- OK.
- OK.

20:46.945 --> 20:49.209
- Bye-bye.
- It was nice to meet you.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.812
I don't think you'll have to worry
about ducking Cathy and Greg anymore.

20:55.921 --> 20:59.789
Thank you, Mrs. Taylor. You know,
you are so much cooler than my parents.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.155
- I am?
- Yeah.

21:01.226 --> 21:05.458
They have this thing about lying.
They think it's wrong.

21:09.468 --> 21:12.198
That's why I love my mom.

21:15.674 --> 21:18.165
<i>Three, four!</i>

21:18.243 --> 21:20.575
One, two, three, four!

21:20.646 --> 21:23.206
One, two, three, four!

21:23.315 --> 21:25.749
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer!

21:25.817 --> 21:28.285
And a Jack, jack, jack.
Jack, jack, jack.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.913
Saw, saw, saw, saw!

21:30.989 --> 21:33.822
And one, two, three, four!

21:33.892 --> 21:36.360
One, two, three, four!

21:36.428 --> 21:38.862
Rivetdance! Huh!

21:38.930 --> 21:41.899
Lord of the Rivets! Huh!

21:41.967 --> 21:44.595
And one and two and three and four
and five and six and seven, eight!

21:44.670 --> 21:48.606
One and two and three and four
and five and six and seven, huh!

21:59.418 --> 22:00.544
Whoo!
