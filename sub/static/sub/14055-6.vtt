WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.500
You married me
because I was pregnant.

00:02.501 --> 00:04.000
I married you
because I loved you.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
I've been working with him
side by side all this time.

00:08.000 --> 00:08.000
How could I have not known that

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
he was bribing this woman
from the city council?

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
I spoke with Renee Wheeler today.
I know about the affair.

00:14.001 --> 00:16.000
16 years is an
awfully long time

00:16.001 --> 00:18.000
to be paying
someone palimony.

00:18.000 --> 00:18.001
Unless there was a child.

00:19.000 --> 00:19.999
I'm talking too much,
as usual.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I just, I get nervous and
I start talking and then...

00:22.000 --> 00:22.001
nothing can shut me up.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
If you were to come forward
to the judge

00:25.001 --> 00:26.500
with the right documentation,

00:26.501 --> 00:28.000
the D.A. would drop
the charges,

00:28.001 --> 00:30.000
What are you doing here?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
What is the point of living
in Southern California

00:52.001 --> 00:54.500
if it's gonna be
this cold?

00:54.501 --> 00:57.000
50 degrees
in December, Cal.

00:57.000 --> 00:57.001
That ain't cold.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Well, my blood
must have gotten thinner.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Or you got ice
in your veins.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
This time next year,

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I could be spending
the holidays behind bars.

01:12.001 --> 01:13.000
Now, that gives me
a chill.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I don't know how you feel
about it.

01:17.000 --> 01:17.999
Warm and fuzzy.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
How do you think
it makes me feel, Sandy?

01:21.001 --> 01:24.000
What the hell else can I do?

01:24.000 --> 01:24.001
You can come forward.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Trial's right around
the corner.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.500
Renee's gonna plead the Fifth,

01:29.501 --> 01:32.000
and when she does,
you're sunk...

01:32.001 --> 01:34.000
unless you tell the truth.

01:34.000 --> 01:34.001
No, I can't.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.500
You know I can't.

01:36.501 --> 01:38.250
What about the child?

01:38.251 --> 01:40.000
Which child?
Lindsay?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
How do you know her name?

01:48.000 --> 01:48.999
But yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
What happens to her?

01:51.000 --> 01:51.999
Spare me.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.500
You're not trying
to protect Lindsay.

01:53.501 --> 01:55.250
You're trying
to protect yourself,

01:55.251 --> 01:57.000
'cause you know
once you come clean,

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
you're gonna get
what's coming to you.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Facing Kirsten and Julie
has got to be better

02:03.001 --> 02:05.000
than going to jail.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Kirsten, maybe.

02:08.001 --> 02:09.000
Not Julie.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Well... then this is it.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.000
I'm done.

02:15.001 --> 02:16.500
So are you.

02:16.501 --> 02:18.000
Happy holidays.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
SETH:
Mother?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Did you not clean out the
menorah from last year?

02:46.001 --> 02:48.000
The shammes is looking
a little bit waxy.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.000
Uh, sorry.

02:50.000 --> 02:50.999
I'll get right on that.

02:51.000 --> 02:51.999
Uh, Seth, a little
help here, please.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Thanks, Mom, 'cause we can't
afford to cut any corners.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Now, if my sense of a cultural
zeitgeist is accurate...

02:57.000 --> 02:57.001
Be careful.

02:58.000 --> 02:58.999
...and I do believe
it is...

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
this is the year that
Chrismukkah sweeps the nation,

03:02.000 --> 03:02.001
okay, people?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Ryan, it's so nice
to have someone

03:05.000 --> 03:05.500
to help around the house.

03:05.501 --> 03:06.000
You're absolutely right.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
It is, which is
why this year,

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I've created a Chrismukkah work wheel

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
so that everybody understands
his and her duties

03:13.001 --> 03:14.000
this holiday season.

03:14.001 --> 03:16.000
Voil?

03:18.000 --> 03:18.999
You're kidding me.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Does it look like I'm kidding?

03:20.001 --> 03:21.000
Let me guess what your job is.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.000
Uh, I'm supervising, smart ass.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.000
Well, that's big of you.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, but I'm also overseeing
licensing

03:25.000 --> 03:25.001
and merchandising, okay?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
T-shirts, mugs,
should it come to that,

03:28.001 --> 03:29.500
and I'm penning
a Chrismukkah hymn

03:29.501 --> 03:31.250
set to Death Cab's
"A Lack of Color."

03:31.251 --> 03:33.000
Ah, all the makings
of a classic.

03:33.000 --> 03:33.001
Is Death Cab a band?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Ooh, around we go on the wheel,

03:35.001 --> 03:36.000
and...
( grunts ).

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Mother, you're in charge
of interior decor, okay?

03:38.001 --> 03:39.500
Now, that's gonna mean,
uh, trimmings,

03:39.501 --> 03:41.250
ornaments, frosting
of the windows.

03:41.251 --> 03:43.000
Don't really know,
don't really care,

03:43.001 --> 03:43.500
just make it classy.

03:43.501 --> 03:44.250
I'll do my best.

03:44.251 --> 03:45.000
I've invited

03:46.000 --> 03:47.500
the Nichols
or the Cooper- Nichols

03:47.501 --> 03:49.000
or whatever
they're called these days.

03:49.000 --> 03:49.001
They're called gentiles

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
and a whole slew
of them at that.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Now, we're gonna have
to really put our heads together

03:54.001 --> 03:55.500
and do some serious
Jewcruitment. Ryan?

03:55.501 --> 03:57.000
Do you think you can
rope in some Hebrews?

03:57.000 --> 03:57.001
Blonde hair, blue eyes?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah, no problem. I'm a natural.

03:59.001 --> 04:00.000
Fair point, my Aryan friend.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Okay, where are we gonna find
some Jews in Orange County?

04:04.001 --> 04:05.000
Father!
I have

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
just discovered the ideal job
for you this Chrismukkah.

04:09.001 --> 04:10.000
Chrismukkah.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Oh, leave me out of it.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Oy, humbug.
Oy, humbug.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
( piano and acoustic guitar
strumming gentle melody )

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
* California, here we come *

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Ah, you know my dad
and the holidays.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Ah, you knHe likes a slow build,
and the holidays.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.001
doesn't want to peak
too soon.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It's a long holiday.
You gotta pace yourself.

05:00.001 --> 05:01.000
Hey!

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It's a marathon
of presents, not a race.

05:04.001 --> 05:06.000
To get through
this holiday season,

05:06.000 --> 05:06.001
you must set a pace.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Those are really
good lyrics for the song.

05:09.001 --> 05:10.000
Do you have a pen on you?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
You're not really
writing a song, are you?

05:12.000 --> 05:12.001
Hey, for Chrismukkah

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
to sweep the nation,
we're gonna need an anthem.

05:16.000 --> 05:16.999
And I'm thinking of having
Little Jo-Jo record it.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
So, in keeping with bringing Chrismukkah
to the masses, you're inviting Alex?

05:20.001 --> 05:22.000
Yeah, I did. She's away
with her folks. Uh-huh.

05:22.001 --> 05:23.000
Probably at some Club
Med tattoo parlor.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't know. What about you?
Uh, uh, is Lindsay around?

05:26.001 --> 05:27.000
Uh, yeah. I think she is.

05:27.001 --> 05:28.000
You gonna invite her?

05:29.000 --> 05:29.999
Ah, I can't.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I mean, it's kind
of a big step.

05:31.001 --> 05:32.000
And with Marissa there,
it'd just...

05:32.001 --> 05:33.000
it'd be too weird
for her, for Lindsay.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
That's the thing-- Marissa's
not gonna be there.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.500
I had my mom draw up
a seating chart,

05:36.501 --> 05:38.000
and she said she's gonna
be with her dad.

05:38.000 --> 05:38.001
Really?
Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, we just got things
to a good place, you know?

05:41.001 --> 05:43.000
I got a little mystery
back. Hmm. All right.

05:43.000 --> 05:43.001
Inviting her over
for the holiday.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
it feels like I might
be rushing things.

05:46.001 --> 05:47.000
Then don't do it, man.

05:47.000 --> 05:47.001
Do not do it.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
The last thing you want
to do is rush things.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
What are you doing?
We're gonna be late.

05:55.001 --> 05:58.000
( moaning )

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Are you sure
we're not rushing things?

06:02.001 --> 06:03.000
Well, you know...

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
we were married
for 17 years, so...

06:08.000 --> 06:08.999
Oh, it's just we've...

06:09.000 --> 06:11.500
It's been so long
since we've done this.

06:11.501 --> 06:14.250
Well, it's like...
it's like riding a bike.

06:14.251 --> 06:17.000
Well, an incredibly toned
and, you know,

06:17.001 --> 06:20.000
evenly tanned
and limber bike.

06:20.001 --> 06:23.000
You know, with
a really sharp mind

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
and an incredible sense

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
of, of, uh...
interior design.

06:29.001 --> 06:32.000
( moaning )

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Oh, slow down. I'm sorry.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
Uh... i-it's, just,
does this count,

06:40.001 --> 06:41.500
um, as, as adultery?

06:41.501 --> 06:43.000
Well, you know...

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
cheating on your husband
with your ex- husband?

06:46.001 --> 06:50.000
Technically, I-I think,
uh, it does, yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Oh...

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Wait, I'm sorry.
It's just... okay...

06:56.000 --> 06:56.001
What?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Caleb and I aren't
getting along.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.500
I mean, he hasn't
touched me in months.

07:00.501 --> 07:02.000
It's... he's probably
going to jail.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Well, it's wonderful how
maturely you're handling it all.

07:07.001 --> 07:09.500
I don't hear you
complaining.

07:09.501 --> 07:12.000
Well, do you
want to stop?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
No.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.500
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

07:25.501 --> 07:27.000
I don't have much
of a lunch break, so...

07:27.001 --> 07:29.000
Why did you want
to meet here?

07:29.001 --> 07:31.000
I've run out of
places to go.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I-I've had so many clandestine
meetings lately, I've...

07:35.001 --> 07:36.000
I feel like I'm in
an Oliver Stone movie.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I-I know you feel that
if you come forward,

07:40.001 --> 07:42.000
you're going to lose
your daughter.

07:42.001 --> 07:43.000
You may lose her
either way.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
The DA's convinced that
Caleb was bribing somebody

07:46.001 --> 07:47.000
in the City
Councilman's office,

07:47.001 --> 07:48.000
bribing you.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.500
And unless somebody
testifies differently,

07:51.501 --> 07:54.000
they have enough evidence
to send you to jail.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
How do I tell my daughter
that I've been lying to her

08:00.001 --> 08:01.000
her whole life?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.500
Inventing a father
she never had,

08:03.501 --> 08:05.000
keeping her from meeting
her family?

08:05.001 --> 08:06.000
Maybe it's time she met 'em.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Maybe it's time
to stop lying.

08:09.001 --> 08:11.000
Caleb won't come forward.

08:11.001 --> 08:12.000
I can't.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
You're our last hope.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I'm sorry.

08:26.000 --> 08:26.999
Hey.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.500
Hey.
So, you're gonna study

08:28.501 --> 08:30.000
through all the Christmas break?

08:30.001 --> 08:31.000
I hope so.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Keep me distracted from having to
remember it's actually Christmas.

08:34.001 --> 08:36.000
Not a fan of the holidays.

08:36.000 --> 08:36.001
Who is?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Uh, well, Seth, actually.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
He's even invented his own
super- holiday, Chrismukkah.

08:42.001 --> 08:43.000
Chrismukkah?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah.
( chuckles )

08:46.001 --> 08:48.000
Well, um, that's cute.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I guess. It's, uh,
it's eight days of gifts,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
followed by one day
of many, many gifts.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
We eat Chinese food
and watch Christmas movies.

08:58.001 --> 09:00.000
Although last year we watched
Over the Top.

09:00.001 --> 09:01.000
Mm. Well, a classic,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
any time of year.
That's what I'm saying.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.000
( chuckles )

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Me and my mom, we, um...

09:08.001 --> 09:10.000
stopped even
buying a tree.

09:10.001 --> 09:12.500
It always just
looked so sad

09:12.501 --> 09:15.000
with just two
gifts under it.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
When I was little...

09:18.001 --> 09:20.000
( chuckles )

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
uh, all my friends
were waiting

09:23.001 --> 09:26.000
for something from Santa,

09:26.001 --> 09:29.000
and... I was just... hoping

09:29.001 --> 09:32.000
for something...

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
anything from my dad.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Still waiting?

09:38.001 --> 09:40.000
Not anymore.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Every kid grows up,
stops believing in Santa.

09:46.001 --> 09:48.000
I stopped believing in my dad.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
And there's no pine
needles to clean up.

09:53.001 --> 09:54.000
So...

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Disappointed by your family
over the holidays.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I've been there.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
So, do what I did:

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
find another family
to spend 'em with.

10:05.000 --> 10:05.001
Um...

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
come over.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Come over for Chrismukkah?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
It'd be better
if you were Jewish.

10:13.000 --> 10:13.999
There's a ratio issue.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
( chuckles )
But it'll be fun,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.500
and Seth will keep you
very distracted.

10:18.501 --> 10:20.250
Do you think we can
watch Over the Top?

10:20.251 --> 10:22.000
I think I could watch
that movie 100 times

10:22.001 --> 10:23.000
and never get sick of it.

10:23.001 --> 10:24.000
( chuckles )

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Where's Zack?

10:28.000 --> 10:28.999
I'm not used to seeing
you without him.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
He left early for Christmas
in Cabo with his fam.

10:32.001 --> 10:35.000
He's been gone one day,
and I miss him already.

10:35.001 --> 10:38.000
DJ's in Sacramento
with his family for two weeks.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Well, this should be
a fun break.

10:41.001 --> 10:43.000
Me, you, Caleb
and my step-monster.

10:43.001 --> 10:44.500
Should be one
for the ages.

10:44.501 --> 10:46.000
We could start spi
Coop!

10:46.001 --> 10:47.000
Kidding.

10:47.001 --> 10:48.000
Kind of.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Actually, not really.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Last year the holidays
were so much fun.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah. I got rejected by Cohen
in a Wonder Woman costume,

10:59.000 --> 11:00.500
and you got caught shoplifting.

11:00.501 --> 11:02.000
Yeah. It was memorable, though.

11:02.001 --> 11:03.000
I guess it was.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Hey, can I get
a large coffee, please?

11:05.001 --> 11:06.000
Thanks.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Hey, guys.
Merry Chrismukkah.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.000
Don't remind us.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I forgot about your
festive little holiday.

11:12.001 --> 11:14.000
Okay. My color-coded
holiday alert system

11:14.001 --> 11:16.000
is attacking you two.

11:16.000 --> 11:16.001
You're Taupe.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Come on-- that's
a very dangerously

11:19.001 --> 11:20.000
low level of holiday cheer.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about, Cohen.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
I, for one, am looking forward
to dinner with my stepmom

11:27.000 --> 11:27.001
face down in
her Christmas ham.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
And I can't wait to be
on my dad's boat

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
and hear him talk about
how much he misses Hailey.

11:33.001 --> 11:34.000
Wait a second, guys.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Summer, Marissa,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
on behalf of Jesus
and Judah Maccabee,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
and the Cohens, I would like
to cordially invite you both

11:43.000 --> 11:43.001
and your dad, Marissa--

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
but not yours, Summer, because
he both scares and hates me--

11:47.001 --> 11:49.000
to come celebrate
a little holiday

11:49.001 --> 11:50.000
I like to call Chrismukkah.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
It's also sort of my way
for apologizing

11:54.001 --> 11:56.000
for the whole snow-sea debacle.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Sure, why not? Okay, I'm in. Whatever.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Hey, somebody just went
from taupe to putty.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Kirsten, are you ready
for the investors' meeting?

12:07.001 --> 12:10.000
I was, and I
attended the meeting...

12:10.001 --> 12:11.000
two hours ago.

12:11.001 --> 12:12.500
What? Two hours...

12:12.501 --> 12:14.000
( sighs ):
Oh!

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
My new assistant is constantly
putting the wrong numbers

12:17.001 --> 12:18.000
into my, my,
my Blackberry.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Mm. We tried to reach you
all morning.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.000
Well, my battery
must have died.

12:23.001 --> 12:25.000
( cell phone rings tune )

12:25.001 --> 12:26.000
Or not.

12:27.000 --> 12:27.999
( cell phone tune plays )

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
That's so funny that
that's Jimmy's favorite song.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.001
Is it?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Huh, I forgot.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
That's why you got
that ring tone.

12:34.001 --> 12:36.000
I got "Hungry Like The Wolf."

12:36.000 --> 12:36.001
He got "The Hustle."

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I was there when you
picked them out.

12:39.000 --> 12:39.001
Oh, it is Jimmy.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.500
Oh, nothing
gets by you, Kirsten.

12:41.501 --> 12:43.000
You've got a memory
like an elephant.

12:43.001 --> 12:44.500
You gonna answer it?

12:44.501 --> 12:46.000
Oh, no. It's just Jimmy.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I thought you two
were getting along

12:48.001 --> 12:49.000
really well.
What makes you say that?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Last week, when you said
that you and Jimmy

12:51.001 --> 12:52.000
were getting along really well.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.500
Julie, you okay?
You seem a little frazzled.

12:55.501 --> 12:57.000
Oh, well, you know,
I didn't get a chance

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
to blow my hair out
this morning, so, you know, I...

13:01.001 --> 13:04.000
I said "frazzled," not "frizzy."

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
SETH:
Hey, man.

13:07.001 --> 13:08.000
Is dinner ready yet?

13:09.000 --> 13:09.999
No. Your dad's
at the grill.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.500
( sighs heavily ):
Oh. I'm famished.

13:11.501 --> 13:13.250
All this planning
for the big day.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.000
Really taking it
out of ya, huh?

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Hey. Ye of little faith,
trust those of mixed faith.

13:20.001 --> 13:22.000
Okay, this year,
it's gonna be off the charts.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.000
It's gonna be cochise.

13:23.001 --> 13:24.000
What's cochise?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
It's the highest level
of holiday cheer

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
on my color-coded holiday
alert system, that's all.

13:29.000 --> 13:29.001
Cochise is a color?

13:30.000 --> 13:30.999
Yeah, it's in
the beige family.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.500
Couldn't go with, like,
blue, could you?

13:32.501 --> 13:34.000
Listen to me.
It's gonna be awesome, okay?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.500
I think especially now
that Marissa and Summer

13:36.501 --> 13:38.000
are coming...
Whoa, Marissa's coming over?

13:38.000 --> 13:38.001
I thought she was with her dad.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah, she was, but she's
all bummed out about it,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
and I figured since, you know,
you're not inviting Lindsay...

13:43.001 --> 13:44.000
Except I did invite Lindsay.

13:45.000 --> 13:45.999
That's awkward.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Seth... ( sighs )
what am I gonna do?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I can't have Lindsay and Marissa
hanging out together.

13:51.001 --> 13:52.500
It's too weird.
I agree.

13:52.501 --> 13:54.000
Not helping.
Oh, God.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
What if it's starting?
What if what's starting?

13:58.000 --> 13:58.999
The Christmukkah backlash.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
What if it's getting
too big and commercial?

14:01.001 --> 14:02.000
I have a feeling
I'm done studying.

14:02.001 --> 14:04.000
Dude, I knew this would happen.

14:04.000 --> 14:04.001
It's like it starts out

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
as this really cool
cult holiday.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
You know, flying beneath
the cultural radar,

14:09.001 --> 14:11.000
and then all of a sudden
it crosses over,

14:11.001 --> 14:12.000
and then there's
too much pressure.

14:13.000 --> 14:13.999
I mean, truthfully,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
can it really be
the next Thanksgiving?

14:15.001 --> 14:16.000
Can it top Halloween?
This feels off topic.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
The government, they're gonna be
asking me to create new holidays.

14:20.001 --> 14:22.000
"Seth, what about Eastover
or, or Kwanzaashanah."

14:22.001 --> 14:24.000
All right, we can't let
it happen. Hey, guys.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.001
Can't talk now, Dad.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
We have an emergency
on our hands.

14:26.001 --> 14:27.000
What's going on?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Nothing. Ryan invited
Lindsay over tomorrow,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
setting off a wildfire
that threatens man, woman,

14:32.000 --> 14:32.001
and Christmukkah.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
You invited Lindsay over here?

14:36.000 --> 14:36.500
Uh, yeah,
is that okay?

14:36.501 --> 14:37.000
Oh, sure.
You ask him.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I don't think
it's such a good idea.

14:42.000 --> 14:42.999
It isn't?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to impose.

14:45.001 --> 14:46.000
Well, no,
it's not that.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
You know we have a pretty
liberal open- door policy.

14:50.001 --> 14:51.000
It's, it's, uh...

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
How serious is it
between you guys?

14:56.000 --> 14:56.001
Uh, I don't know.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
You know,
there's still mystery.

14:59.000 --> 14:59.001
( clears throat )

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Well, maybe not mystery,
but suspense.

15:02.000 --> 15:02.500
So you really like her?

15:02.501 --> 15:03.000
He wants to see her naked.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Okay, I hate it
when you do this...

15:05.000 --> 15:05.001
Sorry.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm starting to.

15:08.000 --> 15:08.001
I mean, should I not?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Her mom's involved
with Caleb's case.

15:11.001 --> 15:13.000
It's, uh... the timing

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
is probably not great,
given everything.

15:16.001 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, yeah, okay.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.001
Okay?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Except, I mean,
what does Lindsay

15:21.001 --> 15:23.000
have to do with
Caleb's case?

15:23.000 --> 15:23.001
And what is she, like,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Caleb's hitman?
Drug dealer?

15:25.001 --> 15:27.000
Illegitimate love child?

15:27.001 --> 15:28.000
( utensil rattles )

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
This stays between us.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
At least until we make it
through these holidays.

15:51.001 --> 15:54.000
Come on.
Dinner's served.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
going somewhere?

16:00.000 --> 16:00.999
Somewhere?
Lindsay's.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Gotta un-invite her,
like your dad said.

16:03.001 --> 16:04.000
You are?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Well, she can't be here
if Caleb's gonna be here.

16:06.001 --> 16:07.000
No, hey, man.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
We thought her and Marissa
together would be awkward.

16:10.001 --> 16:12.000
And, uh, I need you
to do something for me.

16:12.001 --> 16:13.000
Yeah, sure.

16:14.000 --> 16:14.999
Dude, name it.
Anything.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I need you
to un-invite Summer.

16:16.001 --> 16:18.000
I can't do that.

16:18.000 --> 16:18.001
It's rude.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Well, I gotta tell Lindsay

16:21.000 --> 16:21.999
we're not doing
Christmukkah this year.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
If she then finds out that
Marissa and Summer came over...

16:24.001 --> 16:25.000
I see your point. Yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:26.999
Well, while you're out...

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
I mean, you're already gonna
have your speech down, anyway.

16:30.001 --> 16:32.000
Maybe you could go ahead
and stop by Summer's for me.

16:32.001 --> 16:33.000
Dude, please.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
She's not gonna take it
well, man. Neither is Lindsay.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
( sighs )

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Hi.
Hi.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.001
Oh.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Happy Christmukkah.

16:55.001 --> 16:56.000
Yeah. Can we talk?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Oh, yeah. But first,
I have to show you

16:58.001 --> 16:59.000
what I made for tonight.

16:59.001 --> 17:01.000
Oh, all right.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Hey, Merry Christmukkah, Cohen. Oh.

17:08.000 --> 17:08.001
Yes, it is.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
I think tonight is
gonna be so much fun.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah, it'll be great.
Can I talk to you for a second?

17:13.001 --> 17:15.000
Sure. But first,
can you help me

17:15.001 --> 17:17.000
pick out
a Christmas tree?

17:17.001 --> 17:19.000
I'm feeling
all festive today.

17:19.000 --> 17:19.001
Festive, huh?

17:20.000 --> 17:20.999
LINDSAY:
Okay, okay, I know everything

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
I said about not being into
the holidays, which is true.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.500
But then I start thinking
about Christmukkah,

17:25.501 --> 17:27.000
and hanging out with
you and the Cohens...

17:27.001 --> 17:28.000
Right, and about that...

17:28.001 --> 17:29.000
And I got inspired.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
And I stayed up all night.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
And you're gonna think
I'm a really big dork, but...

17:35.001 --> 17:37.000
Okay...
( sighs )

17:37.001 --> 17:38.000
Here.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
It's a yarmul-Claus!

17:42.001 --> 17:44.000
A yarmul-Claus.

17:44.001 --> 17:45.000
Wow.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
That's, wow.

17:48.000 --> 17:48.999
Yeah! Yeah, and I made
a whole bunch,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
and it was fun, and I never
have fun this time of year.

17:52.001 --> 17:54.000
And I don't know if it
was the new holiday

17:54.001 --> 17:56.000
or the idea of spending time
with a family

17:56.001 --> 17:58.000
who actually enjoys
the holiday, but...

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Oh, God.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Wow, um,
listen to me again.

18:05.001 --> 18:08.000
What did you want
to talk about?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Could you bring
eggnog tonight?

18:12.001 --> 18:14.000
Yeah. I'd love to.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Mm.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Fresh minty aroma,
symmetrical conical shape...

18:33.000 --> 18:33.001
Great. Let's go.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
A bit too bushy.
Moving on.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.500
Hmm...

18:39.501 --> 18:41.000
Huh.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Good needle
retention,

18:45.000 --> 18:45.001
nice scent.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Mm... feels a bit dry.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I don't think it's gonna
last much longer.

18:50.001 --> 18:51.000
Summer, neither am I, okay.

18:51.001 --> 18:52.500
All these trees look the same.

18:52.501 --> 18:54.000
Look, Cohen, when it comes to

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Haggadahs, dreidels
and guilt, you the man.

18:57.001 --> 18:58.000
When it comes
to Christmas trees,

18:58.001 --> 18:59.000
mm, a bit out
of your wheel house.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I'm just saying
we've been here for hours.

19:02.000 --> 19:02.001
You are right.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
If I don't pull
the trigger soon,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
we are gonna be late
to your house.

19:07.000 --> 19:07.001
Hey, about that, um...

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
You know, Cohen, I just
think it's really cool

19:12.000 --> 19:12.999
that you invited me tonight.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
You know, after everything
we've been through,

19:15.001 --> 19:17.000
you were able to put aside
our differences.

19:17.001 --> 19:20.000
I just think
you're really changing

19:20.001 --> 19:23.000
and that maybe
we're actually friends.

19:25.000 --> 19:25.999
Great.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
( clears throat )

19:28.001 --> 19:29.000
Mistletoe.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
( chuckles )

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
There something you wanted
to talk to me about?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
How do you feel
about making latkes?

19:45.000 --> 19:45.001
I'd love to.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
And could you just carry
this tree to my car?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Thanks.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Hey, buddy.

20:08.001 --> 20:09.000
Hello, friend.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
How'd it go with Summer?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.000
How did it go with Lindsay?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
She take it better
than expected?

20:15.001 --> 20:16.000
Uh, well... ( sighs )

20:16.001 --> 20:17.500
I couldn't do it.

20:17.501 --> 20:19.000
What? You wussed out?

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
It's just she's always miserable
during the holidays. Dude.

20:23.001 --> 20:25.000
She made a yarmul-Claus.

20:25.001 --> 20:27.000
A yarmu-what?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Holy Moses,
it's beautiful.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
At least Marissa and Summer
aren't coming.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.000
Yeah. About that, um...

20:38.001 --> 20:40.000
Hey, guys.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yarmul-Claus.

20:45.001 --> 20:46.500
Yarmu-what?

20:46.501 --> 20:48.000
It's so cute.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Well, if it isn't the Grinch
and Lady Grinch.

20:54.001 --> 20:55.000
I brought fruitcake.

20:55.001 --> 20:56.000
You shouldn't have.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
May I take your... coats?

20:59.001 --> 21:00.000
We talk?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
That's up to you.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Mmm.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Julie, sorry.
I couldn't resist.

21:09.000 --> 21:09.001
This orange chicken is...

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
God, I have missed you
all day.

21:13.001 --> 21:14.000
Still chewing.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I know.
I feel the same way.

21:17.000 --> 21:17.001
Oh, what are we doing?

21:18.000 --> 21:18.999
I can't stop
thinking about you.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I know, I know, I know.
You know what?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Meet me in the bathroom
in, like, 90 seconds...

21:22.001 --> 21:23.000
Julie, is there any room
in the refrig...

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Keep your fingers out of
the food till we eat, Jimmy.

21:26.001 --> 21:27.000
God. No manners.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Sorry,
I couldn't resist.

21:31.001 --> 21:34.000
I'm... gonna go wash up.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Yeah.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Thanks for the ride, Mom.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.500
Are you sure you
want to do this?

21:52.501 --> 21:54.000
I mean, we hate
the holidays.

21:54.001 --> 21:55.000
That's our pact.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Maybe it's time
to get over that...

21:59.001 --> 22:01.000
get over Dad.

22:03.000 --> 22:03.999
It's Christmukkah.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Ah, so you keep on saying.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
We can go see a movie,
double feature.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Have fun.

22:19.000 --> 22:19.999
Oh, hello.
Hi.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
You're Seth and Ryan's
friend, right?

22:22.000 --> 22:22.001
Uh, yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Me and Ryan are more
like lab partners, really.

22:25.001 --> 22:26.000
Well, come on in.

22:35.000 --> 22:35.999
Summer, come on.
I'm trying.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
That killer clown is
not gonna kill himself.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Faster. You've got to get
more aggressive, Summer.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Ki-kick him. Kick.

22:41.000 --> 22:41.001
Yeah.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You know, you can sit a
little bit closer. I don't bite.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Happy Chrismukkah.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
ALL:
Hey.

22:50.001 --> 22:51.500
Hi.
Hi.

22:51.501 --> 22:53.000
Hey.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
PlayStation?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Uh...
( chuckles )

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I love the holidays.

23:00.001 --> 23:01.000
Just...

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
bringing
everyone together.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.500
So, I've been
thinking about everything,

23:08.501 --> 23:12.000
about the whole family,
about the holidays.

23:12.001 --> 23:14.000
Where are we going
with this, Cal?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I need to tell the truth.

23:18.001 --> 23:20.000
I need to tell Kirsten.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Well, you've got a hell
of a sense of timing.

23:23.001 --> 23:25.000
Oh, there's no good time.

23:25.001 --> 23:27.000
That's true.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
So what are you gonna say?

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Well, I was hoping that you
could help me with that part.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Oh, hi, Renee.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
A-Are you looking for Lindsay?

23:42.001 --> 23:44.000
Actually, I was wondering...

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Can I talk to you?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
A glass of wine, maybe?

23:54.000 --> 23:54.001
No, thank you,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
and I know this
is a terrible time

23:57.001 --> 23:59.000
for me to be showing up.

23:59.001 --> 24:00.500
Oh, not at all.

24:00.501 --> 24:02.000
Is everything okay?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I'm gonna have a glass of wine.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
You have
a beautiful house.

24:13.001 --> 24:15.000
Thank you.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
A-And what I want to say to you,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
i-it should be Caleb
who's saying it.

24:23.001 --> 24:24.000
Well, he's here.

24:24.001 --> 24:25.000
He is?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Would you like me to go get him?

24:27.001 --> 24:28.000
No. Uh...

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
I should be...

24:30.001 --> 24:31.000
Uh, this-this...

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
This isn't
the right time.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Renee.

24:35.001 --> 24:36.000
Caleb.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
What are you doing here?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
She's doing what
you're about to do.

24:41.000 --> 24:41.001
I call dibs on dumplings.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
You now call dibs
on everything.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
When do we watch
Over the Top?

24:45.001 --> 24:46.000
Maybe you should
speak first.

24:46.001 --> 24:48.000
LINDSAY:
Mom.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Lindsay.

24:51.000 --> 24:51.999
Lindsay.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Um, have we met?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Lindsay, sweetie,
could you just, uh...

24:58.001 --> 24:59.000
just give
us a moment?

24:59.001 --> 25:00.000
Why? What's going on?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
That's what I'd like to know.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Uh, I-I'm gonna go.
This isn't right.

25:06.001 --> 25:07.000
No one's
going anywhere

25:07.001 --> 25:08.000
until someone tells me

25:08.001 --> 25:09.000
what the hell is going on.

25:09.001 --> 25:11.000
Hey, what's going on?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Good thing
the kitchen is roomy.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
Cal, why don't you
take it from here?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
I can't believe you
just showed up like this.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Did you really think we could
get away with it forever?

25:26.001 --> 25:28.000
Get away with what?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Dad, start speaking.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Well, does everyone
have to be here for this?

25:33.001 --> 25:34.000
Be here for what, Cal?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
( sighs )

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
I'm sorry it
had to happen

25:41.001 --> 25:42.000
like this, Lindsay.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Kirsten...

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I had hoped
that I could protect you both

25:49.001 --> 25:50.000
from this forever, but...

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
well, circumstances
being what they are,

25:54.001 --> 25:55.500
where your mother and I

25:55.501 --> 25:57.000
face going to prison,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
well, there really
is no choice.

26:00.001 --> 26:04.000
16 years ago, I made...

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I made an error in judgment,

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
one that almost
ruined my marriage.

26:15.001 --> 26:16.000
Oh, my God.

26:16.001 --> 26:17.500
Oh, my God.

26:17.501 --> 26:19.000
No way.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
RENEE:
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

26:22.001 --> 26:24.000
I should have told you.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
You're my father?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Lindsay, wait.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I don't know what to say.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Get out of my house.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Do you think I should go
and talk to her?

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
I think you should
be ashamed of yourself.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
I'll handle your mom.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Hi.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I should talk to Lindsay.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
I'm gonna go check
on my mom, you guys.

27:43.001 --> 27:44.000
Uh...
Just hang out.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
Suddenly, my family--
not so dysfunctional.

27:54.001 --> 27:56.000
You do know this
is my family, too.

27:56.000 --> 27:56.001
Right. Sorry.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.500
I forget sometimes.

27:58.501 --> 28:00.000
It's... it's confusing.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
You knew about this,
and you never told me?

28:03.000 --> 28:03.001
Oh, I couldn't.
You know that.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
Oh, attorney-client
privilege, Sandy.

28:07.000 --> 28:07.001
He cheated on my mom.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.500
I had a sister
I've never known.

28:09.501 --> 28:11.000
Oh, I know, and
we'll figure it out.

28:11.001 --> 28:12.000
What is there to figure out?

28:12.001 --> 28:13.000
Kirsten, please, listen...

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Oh, no. I never want
to see you again,

28:15.001 --> 28:16.000
you son of a bitch!

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
How could you
do that to me?! To Mom?!

28:19.001 --> 28:20.000
Kirsten, please. I can explain.

28:20.001 --> 28:22.000
Just get out!

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Kiki, honey, please.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
CALEB:
Kirsten!

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Now is not the
time, Cal. Please.

28:35.001 --> 28:37.000
Let me try to talk to her.
Grandpa,

28:37.001 --> 28:39.000
I think maybe you should leave.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
I'll be better off
going to prison.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Is she here?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
This isn't a good time, Ryan.

29:04.001 --> 29:06.000
I know. I just...

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I want to talk to her
and make sure she's okay.

29:09.000 --> 29:09.001
She's not.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Well, can I even talk
to her for a second?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
It's okay, Mom.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I can speak
for myself.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Hi.

29:30.000 --> 29:30.500
( sighs )

29:30.501 --> 29:31.000
So sorry.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
I know you want
to be alone

29:35.001 --> 29:36.000
right now, but, um,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
I want you to know I'm here.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Okay?

29:46.000 --> 29:46.999
( sniffles )

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
I think it's best...

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
if we don't see
each other anymore.

29:52.000 --> 29:52.999
I just...

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
I don't want to be

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
anywhere
near your family...

29:58.000 --> 29:58.999
Ever.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.500
Um, but... thanks

30:01.501 --> 30:04.000
for coming by.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Happy holidays, huh?

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
( door closes )

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
This year is getting even
weirder than last year.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.000
I know.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
My ex-boyfriend
is dating my...

30:40.001 --> 30:41.500
stepsister?

30:41.501 --> 30:43.000
I think.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
We have new boyfriends.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
And our ex-boyfriends
have new girlfriends.

30:50.001 --> 30:52.000
Is that what
they are--

30:52.001 --> 30:54.000
um, their,
uh, girlfriends?

30:54.001 --> 30:56.000
I think.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
And now my stepdad
could be going to jail.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Is there something
in the water?

31:08.000 --> 31:08.999
How'd it go?

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Hey. Is there,
anything we can do?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I think we have
to cancel Chrismukkah.

31:34.000 --> 31:34.999
Hey.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.500
How's Lindsay?

31:36.501 --> 31:38.000
Uh, not so good.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
How'd everything
go with your mom?

31:41.001 --> 31:42.000
Uh, we're at "Charcoal"

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
on my color-coded
holiday alert system.

31:45.001 --> 31:46.000
Your poor mom.

31:46.001 --> 31:47.000
Your poor mom.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah, of all the people
to feel sorry for here,

31:51.001 --> 31:53.000
she's not really
high on my list.

31:53.000 --> 31:53.001
So then Chrismukkah?

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Canceled. The way nature,
and apparently we, intended it.

31:57.001 --> 31:59.000
That is so sad.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.500
Chrismukkah is supposed

32:00.501 --> 32:01.000
to bring people together.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
It's the time of year that you
look forward to most, Cohen.

32:05.001 --> 32:07.500
Yeah, well, you know,
my mom throwing vases

32:07.501 --> 32:10.000
at my grandfather's head
kind of trumps it,

32:10.001 --> 32:12.000
even if it has
twice the resistance

32:12.000 --> 32:12.001
of your average holiday.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
RYAN:
You want a ride home, man?

32:15.001 --> 32:16.000
Yeah, actually, I do--

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
unless someone needs help
with a gi-normous tree

32:20.001 --> 32:21.000
strapped to her car.

32:21.001 --> 32:22.000
So that's it?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
You guys are just
gonna give up?

32:25.000 --> 32:25.999
Give up on Chrismukkah

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
when everyone
we know needs it the most?

32:28.001 --> 32:29.000
Okay, thank you, Tiny Tim.

32:29.001 --> 32:30.000
Ow!

32:31.000 --> 32:32.500
Okay, well, what do you
want to do, Summ?

32:32.501 --> 32:34.250
'Cause we can't
go back to the Cohens'.

32:34.251 --> 32:36.000
And Lindsay'll never
talk to me again.

32:36.001 --> 32:37.000
And I can no longer walk.

32:38.000 --> 32:38.999
Well, you guys can all give up,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
but I still believe
in a Chrismukkah miracle.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
And I have a plan.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
I've been looking for you
all over the house.

32:57.001 --> 32:59.000
I wanted to see if
Marissa was back yet.

32:59.001 --> 33:00.000
She's not.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.500
You can bet
she will make this about her

33:03.501 --> 33:06.000
and that we will suffer
the consequences

33:06.001 --> 33:08.000
for a very long time.

33:08.000 --> 33:08.001
I know.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
It's tough on everyone,

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
which is why I tried
to keep it a secret.

33:15.000 --> 33:15.999
You and your secrets, Cal.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
You need a walk-in closet
for all of your skeletons.

33:20.001 --> 33:23.000
I promise you...
this is the end.

33:23.000 --> 33:23.001
Yeah?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.500
You don't have an evil twin?

33:25.501 --> 33:27.000
You're not really an alien?

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
And now that the truth
is out there...

33:32.001 --> 33:33.000
the case will go away.

33:33.001 --> 33:34.000
I'll be free.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
I just can't believe
you cheated on your wife.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
It was hell, and it never
happened again, never will.

33:43.001 --> 33:46.000
I have everything I need
from this marriage.

33:46.001 --> 33:47.000
I hope you feel the same.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Don't put this
back on me, Cal.

33:50.000 --> 33:50.001
I wasn't.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
I was merely saying...

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
( sighs )

33:57.001 --> 33:58.000
Uh...

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
I don't know
what I'm saying anymore.

34:05.000 --> 34:05.999
I'm tired of lying.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I want this whole thing
to be over,

34:08.001 --> 34:10.000
and I... I need you
to forgive me.

34:10.001 --> 34:12.000
I'm going to go try
and find Marissa.

34:12.001 --> 34:13.000
Does that mean you forgive me?

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
I don't know.

34:22.000 --> 34:22.500
Hi.

34:22.501 --> 34:23.000
Hey.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
You went and saw Lindsay?

34:26.000 --> 34:26.001
Tried.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Oh, poor girl.

34:28.001 --> 34:29.000
How goes it here?

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
Fantastic. Kirsten's locked
herself in her closet.

34:33.001 --> 34:35.000
And other than requesting
a PowerBar be slid

34:35.001 --> 34:37.000
under the door,
she isn't speaking to me.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
But on the plus side, there's
plenty of mu shu available.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
I'm sorry.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Uh, I just, I want you to know
I'm sorry I didn't un-invite...

34:48.001 --> 34:51.000
Oh, kid, this is so far
from being your fault.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.500
Well, you don't
think it's yours.

34:52.501 --> 34:54.000
No, but no good deed
goes unpunished,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
which explains why my wife is
holed up next to a shoe rack.

35:00.000 --> 35:00.999
( sighs )

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Hey, you mind if
I talk to her?

35:03.001 --> 35:05.000
It's your life.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
KIRSTEN:
Go away.

35:12.001 --> 35:15.000
It's Ryan.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
I don't really feel like
talking to anyone right now.

35:20.001 --> 35:22.000
Uh...

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
I know, I...

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
was hoping we could
talk about Lindsay.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Is she okay?

35:34.001 --> 35:35.000
No.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
Well, not right now,
but I guess it depends.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
Depends on what?

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
On whether or not she
figures out she's...

35:49.001 --> 35:52.000
part of a family
that's pretty good

35:52.001 --> 35:54.000
at letting in new members.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.500
Good line.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.000
Thanks.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Just don't tell Sandy that
I came out for you, okay?

36:16.001 --> 36:19.000
Yeah, 'cause he wouldn't want
to hear that.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
( sighs )

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
You want to meet your sister?

36:26.001 --> 36:27.000
( sighs )

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
I don't know if I'm ready to
start referring to her as that.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
( sobbing ):
But Lindsay seems like

36:37.001 --> 36:38.000
a really great girl.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
She is.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Whoa. Coop, I cannot believe
your dad lives on a boat.

36:48.001 --> 36:49.000
That is so Miami Vice.

36:49.001 --> 36:50.000
You've seen Miami Vice?

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Repeats. My stepmom, she finds
the pastel colors soothing.

36:53.001 --> 36:56.000
Hmm. She's on some
interesting drugs these days.

36:56.001 --> 36:58.000
Hmm. Which I will be
keeping away from you.

36:58.001 --> 36:59.000
Hmm.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.500
Dad!

37:02.501 --> 37:04.000
Dad?

37:05.000 --> 37:05.500
Hi, girls.

37:05.501 --> 37:06.000
Hey.
Hey.

37:07.000 --> 37:07.999
How are you?
We're okay.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
We're just kind
of in a rush,

37:10.000 --> 37:10.999
and we were wondering:

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
do you have a generator
and an extension cord?

37:13.001 --> 37:15.000
Okay, I don't really like
the sound of that.

37:15.001 --> 37:16.000
Oh, it's really
important, Mr. Cooper.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
A Chrismukkah miracle
hangs in the balance.

37:19.001 --> 37:20.000
Mm-hmm. We'll explain later.

37:20.001 --> 37:21.000
Well, luckily,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
living on a boat requires one
to have such stuff.

37:25.001 --> 37:27.000
It's right around
the corner.

37:27.001 --> 37:28.000
Oh, got it.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
Now... have you,
have you spoken to your mom?

37:32.001 --> 37:34.000
She's worried sick
about you.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.000
Oh, really?
That's too bad.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
You've been talking to her
a lot lately.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
You're not, like,
becoming friends, or anything.

37:42.001 --> 37:45.000
Why? Would that, uh,
would that be so terrible?

37:45.000 --> 37:45.001
Yeah, for you.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
SUMMER:
All right.

37:47.001 --> 37:48.000
Got it, Coop. Let's go.

37:48.001 --> 37:50.000
Love you, Dad.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.000
Thanks, Mr. Coop.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Here, can you
take something?

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
This is going to be
excellent, Summer.

37:58.001 --> 38:00.000
I'm so excited.
Take it. Take it.

38:00.001 --> 38:01.000
Oh, take something?
Yeah.

38:01.001 --> 38:03.000
( sighs )

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
They're gone.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
( sighs ):
I don't suppose you heard

38:11.001 --> 38:12.000
any of that, did you?

38:12.000 --> 38:12.001
Please.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
It's almost a compliment
from her.

38:14.001 --> 38:18.000
What are we doing, Julie?

38:18.001 --> 38:19.000
Are we...

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
are we making
a huge mistake?

38:23.001 --> 38:27.000
Yeah.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
But I want to be with you.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
( waves crashing )

38:45.000 --> 38:45.999
Hey.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
What are you doing here?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Uh, your mom said I
could maybe find you here.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
She also said you're not in
the mood to see any friends.

38:55.000 --> 38:55.001
I'm not.

38:56.000 --> 38:56.999
Okay. I get that.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
But here's the
thing, Lindsay.

39:00.001 --> 39:01.000
You and I, we're kin.

39:01.001 --> 39:02.000
No. No, we're not.

39:02.001 --> 39:03.000
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Congratulations,
you're a Cohen.

39:06.000 --> 39:06.001
( sighs )

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Welcome to a life of insecurity
and paralyzing self doubt.

39:11.001 --> 39:14.000
It's a little soon to joke.

39:14.001 --> 39:15.000
Not for us Cohens.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It's what we do:
laugh through our tears,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
make jokes inappropriately
soon after a traumatic event.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
Sometimes we'll just make the
joke during the traumatic event.

39:26.001 --> 39:27.000
Yeah, "traumatic," Seth,

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
doesn't even begin
to describe this.

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
Look... I get that what happened
seems really overwhelming.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.000
Oh, do you?

39:39.001 --> 39:40.000
Yeah, I do.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
But I think you and I have
a lot to be grateful for.

39:43.001 --> 39:45.000
Most of all that we
didn't start dating.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
Oh, yeah, 'cause that would have
been gross on... several levels.

39:51.001 --> 39:52.000
Hey. There you go.

39:53.000 --> 39:53.999
That's what I'm
talking about.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
You are a Cohen, okay?
And I like that.

39:56.001 --> 39:58.000
You know what that
means, by the way?

39:58.001 --> 40:00.000
It means you get
one of these.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Enjoy.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Um...

40:08.000 --> 40:08.999
it says "Laura."

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
It's the only one
they had at the store.

40:12.001 --> 40:13.000
We'll fix it later.

40:13.001 --> 40:14.000
( giggles )

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
So, when did you come up with
this holiday, exactly?

40:18.001 --> 40:19.000
Oh, no, I didn't,
actually.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
Jesus and Moses, they put
it together over lunch

40:23.001 --> 40:25.000
a few years back now,
I think it was.

40:25.001 --> 40:27.000
What does Moses have to do
with Hanukkah?

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Wait, no, I think, actually,
you're missing the point

40:31.001 --> 40:32.000
of the holiday
completely.

40:32.001 --> 40:35.000
Which is...?

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Hi.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
I'm Kirsten.

41:03.001 --> 41:06.000
Hi.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.500
( sobs )

41:09.501 --> 41:11.000
Welcome.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
( voice breaking ):
This is really weird.

41:18.001 --> 41:21.000
Oh, it's our family.

41:21.001 --> 41:24.000
( chuckles )

41:26.000 --> 41:26.999
Thank you for doing this.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Oh, thanks
for coming forward.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
You did the right thing.

41:32.001 --> 41:33.000
Yeah?

41:33.001 --> 41:34.000
Mm-hmm.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
And maybe someday
Lindsay will forgive me.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
( sighs ): So, Summer
Roberts, you saved Chrismukkah.

41:48.001 --> 41:49.000
Kind of did, didn't I?

41:49.001 --> 41:50.000
I hope I can repay you.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
Well, you can start by carrying
my tree to my car later.

41:54.001 --> 41:55.000
Hmm?
( door opens )

41:55.001 --> 41:57.000
Hey, guys.

41:57.000 --> 41:57.001
Hey.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Eggnog, latkes.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
SETH: None for
Summer-- gives her gas.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
I figured you hadn't had
a Christmas tree for a while.

42:08.001 --> 42:10.000
I don't even know what to say.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
You don't have to say anything
right now.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Hey. I've got latkes.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
Oh, uh... that sounds
kind of disgusting.

42:21.000 --> 42:21.001
Yeah, I know.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Can we order pizza?

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
All right. Who's ready
to hear the Chrismukkah hymn?

42:27.001 --> 42:29.000
It's penned to Death Cab's
"A Lack of Color."

42:29.000 --> 42:29.001
MARISSA:
What is that?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
What? No one knows
what that song is, Cohen.

42:32.001 --> 42:34.000
Seth carrying a tune?
Now, that would be

42:34.001 --> 42:36.000
a Chrismukkah miracle.
Merry Chrismukkah.

42:36.001 --> 42:38.000
I'll tell you what else
you can carry--

42:38.001 --> 42:40.000
that negativity
out on the street.

42:40.000 --> 42:40.001
Miracles?
Chrismukkah fact...

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
All right, first...
Have an eggnog.

42:42.001 --> 42:43.500
Who ma...?
These are so shoddy.

42:43.501 --> 42:45.000
We'll have to work
on the...

42:45.001 --> 42:46.000
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Come on, come on.
Sing, sing, sing, sing.

42:48.001 --> 42:49.000
All right.
All right.

42:50.000 --> 42:50.999
En

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Moses and Jesus

42:52.001 --> 42:53.000
Yeah!

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
They both
have beards...

42:55.001 --> 42:56.000
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
