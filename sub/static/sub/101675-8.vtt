00:04.758 --> 00:05.846
<i>Hello, Mrs. Cooper.</i>

00:05.931 --> 00:07.105
I just wanted to let you know,

00:07.189 --> 00:08.487
with Dr. Sturgis away,

00:08.572 --> 00:11.012
I'll be available
should Sheldon need anything.

00:11.143 --> 00:12.424
<i>Now, I'm not terribly</i>

00:12.509 --> 00:13.854
experienced
around children.

00:13.939 --> 00:15.323
If he needs to use the restroom,

00:15.408 --> 00:17.384
I don't have to go in with him,
do I?

00:18.081 --> 00:19.675
I don't need you to babysit me.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.430
I'm perfectly self-reliant.

00:21.515 --> 00:22.741
Then it's good
I kept the receipt

00:22.825 --> 00:25.296
for this bottle of bubbles
shaped like a bear.

00:25.828 --> 00:28.094
Welcome to the world
of philosophy.

00:28.178 --> 00:29.617
I'm going
to teach you

00:29.701 --> 00:32.234
that you don't even know
what you think you know.

00:32.812 --> 00:34.100
Oh, boy.

00:34.343 --> 00:36.476
I'm not going to school.
Why not?

00:36.561 --> 00:38.367
Because I don't know
what's real.

00:39.232 --> 00:40.882
Nothing matters.

00:41.533 --> 00:42.992
George?!

00:47.197 --> 00:48.332
All right,

00:48.416 --> 00:49.420
what's the problem here?

00:49.504 --> 00:50.945
I don't know what's real.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.041
That's a fun thing to think
about on the way to school.

00:53.125 --> 00:54.391
Get up and get dressed.

00:54.476 --> 00:55.861
Maybe I'm already dressed.

00:55.945 --> 00:58.773
Maybe I'm wearing
a zoot suit and spats.

00:59.116 --> 01:01.570
That's a shoe covering that's
short for "spatterdasher."

01:01.699 --> 01:02.790
Or is it?

01:02.875 --> 01:04.217
There's no way to know.

01:04.301 --> 01:06.088
Here's what I know: I don't have
time for this nonsense.

01:06.172 --> 01:07.481
What is time?

01:07.565 --> 01:08.711
What is sense?

01:08.796 --> 01:10.273
What is "is"?

01:10.358 --> 01:11.617
Sheldon, I mean it.

01:11.702 --> 01:14.012
I remember
when things meant things.

01:14.311 --> 01:16.229
All right, I'm gonna count
to three. One...

01:16.313 --> 01:18.836
Believing in numbers...
That takes me back.

01:18.949 --> 01:20.891
- Two...
- To be or not to be.

01:20.976 --> 01:22.495
Shakespeare was onto something.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.328
It's your last chance.

01:24.804 --> 01:26.424
Have you ever wondered
if you're the tongue

01:26.509 --> 01:28.694
of a multidimensional being
trying to taste something

01:28.787 --> 01:30.656
you can never even understand?

01:31.286 --> 01:32.809
I have.

01:37.082 --> 01:38.632
I talked to him.

01:39.632 --> 01:41.036
Where is your mother?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.468
She had to leave for work.

01:42.625 --> 01:43.822
I have to work, too.

01:43.906 --> 01:45.911
You also get to take me
to school.

01:45.995 --> 01:47.652
What am I supposed to do
about your brother?

01:47.736 --> 01:48.914
Call me old-fashioned,

01:48.998 --> 01:50.350
but I say spank him.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.301
Your mom won't let me.

Sheldon won't get out of bed,
and I'm gonna be late for work.

02:17.357 --> 02:18.498
He's gonna be late
for school.

02:18.582 --> 02:20.718
So you want me
to get him up and drive him?

02:20.856 --> 02:21.888
Yeah.

Hey, Moon Pie.

02:28.232 --> 02:29.781
What's going on here?

02:29.865 --> 02:31.217
That's an excellent question.

02:31.301 --> 02:32.784
Too bad there's no answer.

02:32.868 --> 02:34.394
Well, you need
to get out of bed.

02:34.478 --> 02:36.224
I don't need to do anything.

02:36.393 --> 02:37.789
Okay, I'm gonna count to three.

02:37.873 --> 02:39.591
Dad already counted to three.

02:39.676 --> 02:40.935
Oh.

02:41.746 --> 02:43.185
Did he try the Texas thing?

02:43.269 --> 02:44.273
No.

02:44.357 --> 02:45.888
In that case,

02:46.255 --> 02:47.320
look at you,

02:47.404 --> 02:48.490
lyin' there.

02:48.575 --> 02:50.201
When a Texan gets
knocked off a horse,

02:50.286 --> 02:51.943
he gets right back on.

02:52.028 --> 02:53.717
That is the second most
important thing

02:53.802 --> 02:55.458
about bein' a Texan,

02:55.543 --> 02:58.826
right after thinkin' you're
better than everybody else.

03:00.034 --> 03:01.991
Maybe the horse
gets back on the Texan.

03:02.076 --> 03:03.120
Who's to say?

03:04.586 --> 03:06.243
I don't know what that means.

03:06.327 --> 03:08.279
That's because
you can't know anything.

03:10.150 --> 03:11.904
If you need
to stare at the ceiling

03:11.989 --> 03:13.908
and contemplate
the futility of existence,

03:13.993 --> 03:16.022
Missy's bed is available.

03:18.748 --> 03:19.786
Amazing.

03:19.871 --> 03:21.180
What is?

03:21.264 --> 03:23.878
I've been using this same pen
for seven months,

03:23.962 --> 03:25.402
and it's still going.

03:25.486 --> 03:27.146
That's your bar for amazing?

03:27.231 --> 03:28.794
Yeah.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.275
Sad.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.818
It's the same pen.

03:31.918 --> 03:34.302
It is too early in the morning for you.

03:35.670 --> 03:36.997
Hello.

03:37.454 --> 03:39.443
Yeah. I'll be down in a bit.

03:41.724 --> 03:43.083
Where ya headed?

03:43.169 --> 03:44.595
Principal's office.

03:44.679 --> 03:46.814
Ooh, you're in trouble...

03:46.898 --> 03:47.943
You're a child.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.422
I'd rather be a
child than in trouble.

03:51.941 --> 03:53.247
Shelly,

03:53.332 --> 03:55.724
Dr. Sturgis is
on the line for you.

03:55.927 --> 03:57.521
Maybe he is,
maybe he isn't,

03:57.637 --> 03:58.998
but very well.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.751
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Sheldon.</i>

04:00.836 --> 04:04.234
I hear you're going through
some sort of existential crisis.

04:04.419 --> 04:05.888
I suppose so.

04:05.973 --> 04:08.326
I just don't know if we can tell
what's real or not.

04:08.483 --> 04:10.091
And if nothing's real,
I don't know

04:10.176 --> 04:12.599
what to think
or if I'm even thinking at all.

04:12.785 --> 04:15.349
I went through
something similar once.

04:15.675 --> 04:17.463
Really? What happened?

04:17.624 --> 04:20.357
I was trekking
through the Amazon,

04:20.442 --> 04:22.578
and I saw two frogs,

04:22.764 --> 04:24.899
one hallucinogenic

04:25.023 --> 04:26.513
and the other not.

04:26.609 --> 04:30.553
I tried to lick the normal one,

04:30.638 --> 04:31.946
<i>and, by mistake,</i>

04:32.030 --> 04:34.435
I licked the hallucinogenic one.

04:34.717 --> 04:37.279
It really rocked my world.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.615
Why would you lick
either of them?

04:39.793 --> 04:42.521
I'm not sure.
Probably low blood sugar.

04:42.606 --> 04:43.930
But the point is,

04:44.015 --> 04:46.542
I also lost track of reality.

04:46.627 --> 04:47.977
How did you handle it?

04:48.062 --> 04:50.067
I saw a jaguar,

04:50.152 --> 04:54.359
and I realized I didn't care
if it was real or not.

04:54.444 --> 04:57.531
I just hauled my tushy out
of there.

04:57.632 --> 04:58.914
I appreciate the call.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.852
I'm giving you back
to my meemaw now.

05:01.211 --> 05:02.408
Bye!

05:05.665 --> 05:06.984
Hey, John,

05:07.069 --> 05:08.286
any luck?

05:08.441 --> 05:11.229
Not unless you have access
to a jaguar.

05:11.314 --> 05:12.797
I don't think I do.

05:13.044 --> 05:15.578
Really, any jungle cat will do.

05:15.841 --> 05:17.281
Hey, Tom.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.832
George.

05:18.932 --> 05:20.085
Sheldon's not here anymore.

05:20.170 --> 05:21.586
Thought it'd be a while
before I got called back

05:21.671 --> 05:23.151
into the principal's office.

05:23.432 --> 05:25.437
How's he doing?
I miss that kid.

05:25.684 --> 05:28.052
He took a philosophy class
and won't get out of bed

05:28.137 --> 05:30.139
'cause he doesn't know
what's real anymore.

05:31.153 --> 05:32.505
Anyway, uh,

05:32.769 --> 05:34.296
we need to talk about Georgie.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.232
Should've seen that coming.

05:36.492 --> 05:37.900
- What's wrong?
- Well,

05:37.985 --> 05:39.664
he's been cutting classes.

05:39.749 --> 05:40.666
Already?

05:40.751 --> 05:42.016
Semester's barely started.

05:42.272 --> 05:43.531
He's a go-getter.

05:43.624 --> 05:44.836
Mm.

05:45.210 --> 05:47.180
I'll talk to him.Thanks.

05:49.220 --> 05:51.095
How's the team looking
this year, George?

05:51.180 --> 05:54.196
We just had
one difficult conversation, Tom.

05:54.281 --> 05:56.008
Let's not have another.

05:56.093 --> 05:57.991
- Smart.
<i>- While</i> my meemaw

05:58.076 --> 06:00.647
wasn't able to acquire
a jungle cat,

06:00.732 --> 06:04.609
the idea of tormenting a child
did tickle her Texan fancy.

06:04.694 --> 06:07.265
Sheldon.

06:09.345 --> 06:12.264
I have someone else
who wants to talk to you.

06:12.380 --> 06:13.875
What are you doing
with that filthy thing?

06:13.960 --> 06:15.592
Why do you care?

06:15.677 --> 06:17.070
If nothing is real,

06:17.231 --> 06:19.204
then neither is the chicken.

06:21.735 --> 06:23.274
Oh. Good.

06:23.359 --> 06:25.500
We're standing now.
That's progress.

06:25.716 --> 06:26.938
Get her out of here.

06:27.023 --> 06:28.585
Well, I would, but...

06:28.669 --> 06:30.164
apparently,

06:30.249 --> 06:33.386
I can't know
what "here" is.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.516
So maybe I could just...

06:35.601 --> 06:36.984
set her on your bed.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.240
Okay! Okay.

06:38.325 --> 06:39.320
I'll get dressed.

06:39.405 --> 06:40.841
Make it snappy.

06:41.420 --> 06:44.035
This still doesn't solve
my existential crisis.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.170
Say what?
You want to hold her?

06:46.659 --> 06:47.781
No.

06:48.102 --> 06:49.585
Less talk.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.149

07:19.378 --> 07:21.192

you don't care about that.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.098
Now, sit.

07:50.105 --> 07:51.747
What the hell
you doin'?

07:52.059 --> 07:53.690
I cut a class.
Who cares?

07:53.775 --> 07:55.918
It was more than
one, and I care.

07:56.633 --> 07:59.033
You start flunking out, you're
gonna get kicked off the team.

07:59.286 --> 08:00.466
Fine.

08:00.825 --> 08:02.685
Now you don't care
about football?

08:02.965 --> 08:04.184
Not really.

08:05.264 --> 08:06.537
I don't know
what's going on with you,

08:06.621 --> 08:08.381
but you better get your head out
of your ass.

08:08.471 --> 08:10.041
Football's a waste of time.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.499
I have a job
I could be at.

08:11.584 --> 08:13.944
You made a commitment to the
team and you're gonna honor it.

08:16.527 --> 08:18.090
We done?

08:19.999 --> 08:21.645
Just get back to class.

08:23.916 --> 08:25.704
And I better see you
at practice.

08:25.937 --> 08:28.330
Well, I don't know if I can
find it with my head up my ass.

08:30.319 --> 08:31.410
So,

08:31.494 --> 08:33.542
according to de Broglie,
lambda equals "h"

08:33.626 --> 08:35.082
divided by "m" times what?

08:35.573 --> 08:36.631
Sheldon.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.035
Is it velocity?

08:38.121 --> 08:39.106
Yes. Now...

08:39.191 --> 08:40.587
Or is it a velociraptor?

08:40.938 --> 08:42.029
I'm sorry?

08:42.113 --> 08:44.030
Perhaps lambda
equals "h" divided

08:44.115 --> 08:45.859
by "m" times a velociraptor.

08:46.315 --> 08:48.106
Or a velveteen
rabbit.

08:48.191 --> 08:49.369
Ooh, or Velveeta.

08:49.454 --> 08:51.024
That's the cheese
my mom puts on broccoli

08:51.109 --> 08:52.866
when she's being fancy.

08:53.638 --> 08:55.556
Is this
from your philosophy class

08:55.687 --> 08:57.953
or perhaps that Ren & Stumpy
I've heard about?

08:58.061 --> 08:59.236
Philosophy.

09:00.087 --> 09:02.092
Mr. Cooper,
do you really believe

09:02.177 --> 09:04.981
that de Broglie's equation
contains Velveeta cheese?

09:05.136 --> 09:07.653
I don't know. Maybe he was just
trying to be fancy.

09:09.012 --> 09:10.143
Hello.

09:10.228 --> 09:11.395
Can I help you?

09:11.506 --> 09:13.223
Hi. I'm Connie Tucker.

09:13.308 --> 09:15.313
I'm Sheldon Cooper's
grandmother.

09:15.406 --> 09:17.942
Oh.
Nice to meet you.

09:18.193 --> 09:20.239
He is a remarkable young man.

09:20.324 --> 09:23.896
Yes, he is. He's also
a very impressionable young man.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.899
Kind of like a lump of clay
with a bow tie.

09:27.418 --> 09:30.114
All I did was teach him
about epistemology.

09:30.199 --> 09:31.725
Whatever it is
you're teaching him,

09:31.856 --> 09:34.817
it has made him
question everything.

09:34.902 --> 09:36.124
That's the goal.

09:36.261 --> 09:38.529
Lady, I had to threaten him
with a chicken

09:38.614 --> 09:40.278
so he'd put his pants on.

09:40.363 --> 09:42.238
I don't know
what's gotten into that kid.

09:42.323 --> 09:44.632
He's allowed to not
want to play football.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.811
Can you for once in your life
take my side, Wayne?

09:47.896 --> 09:49.944
Not my fault you're never right.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.450
So you think it's okay
he just quits?

09:52.664 --> 09:54.622
He doesn't get
that much playing time.

09:55.839 --> 09:57.786
Well, in my family,
we don't quit.

09:58.032 --> 10:00.951
Oh, I don't know. You quit
my book club pretty quick.

10:01.036 --> 10:02.715
I'm talking about football!

10:02.800 --> 10:04.989
Why is it so important
to you that he play?

10:05.411 --> 10:07.375
Are you sure you're a coach?

10:07.723 --> 10:11.629
Team sports provides confidence,
leadership, discipline.

10:11.714 --> 10:13.066
So does holding down a job,

10:13.247 --> 10:14.918
which he seems to shine at.

10:16.043 --> 10:18.051
Let's just eat in silence.

10:18.528 --> 10:20.028
Fine.

10:22.954 --> 10:25.369
I still think you should have
read The Color Purple.

10:25.489 --> 10:26.838
We were bawling.

10:28.418 --> 10:31.072
Although tasty, a brick
of cheese is not a number.

10:31.157 --> 10:33.395
Why are we still
talking about this?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.059
Maybe we're not talking at all.

10:35.411 --> 10:37.402
Okay, that's enough for today.

10:38.148 --> 10:39.849
Not your best lecture.

10:40.059 --> 10:42.064
It's fairly normal
for first-time

10:42.149 --> 10:44.989
philosophy students
to have their worldviews shaken.

10:45.149 --> 10:46.588
Do they snap out of it?

10:46.887 --> 10:48.590
Well, you hope.

10:48.918 --> 10:51.395
Professor Ericson,
I insist...

10:51.482 --> 10:53.923
Hello, Connie.
What a pleasant surprise.

10:54.117 --> 10:55.382
Hey.

10:55.467 --> 10:56.646
I'm sorry you're about to see me

10:56.730 --> 10:58.039
speak harshly to my colleague.

10:58.278 --> 11:00.196
Have at it. Professor Ericson,

11:00.295 --> 11:01.487
I insist that you speak
to this young man

11:01.572 --> 11:03.268
and explain to him
that reality is real,

11:03.353 --> 11:05.410
and it's possible
to know things as fact.

11:05.495 --> 11:08.277
The class is called
"Introduction to Philosophy."

11:08.399 --> 11:09.620
That's what I did.

11:09.705 --> 11:11.424
Well, un-introduce him.

11:11.509 --> 11:13.123
Yes, he's at this school
'cause of his brilliant

11:13.208 --> 11:14.817
scientific mind,
and he spent my last class

11:14.902 --> 11:16.733
talking about
processed cheese.

11:16.945 --> 11:18.209
Sheldon, is that true?

11:18.294 --> 11:19.559
Nothing's true.

11:19.933 --> 11:22.240
You see what you've done?
You broke him.

11:24.973 --> 11:26.379
Hey.

11:27.663 --> 11:29.885
How come you didn't want
to get out of bed this morning?

11:30.225 --> 11:33.318
If I can't know what's real,
what's the point?

11:34.080 --> 11:35.963
You have the right words.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.260
You're just saying them
wrong.

11:38.672 --> 11:40.996
It's not,
"What's the point?"

11:41.204 --> 11:43.078
It's, "What's the point?"

11:43.812 --> 11:45.406
I don't understand.

11:45.555 --> 11:48.259
Asking these questions
is exciting.

11:48.786 --> 11:50.586
It's what gets me
out of bed.

11:51.681 --> 11:53.579
That's interesting.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.108
Richard Feynman did say

11:55.193 --> 11:56.721
the greatest joy in life
is the pleasure of

11:56.806 --> 11:58.288
finding things out.

11:58.516 --> 12:00.913
Feynman...
He's the physics guy, right?

12:00.998 --> 12:03.539
Yes. And your
perfume is beguiling.

12:04.450 --> 12:06.542
It's all making sense to me
now.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.209
Thank you.

12:08.572 --> 12:09.962
I am happy to help.

12:10.166 --> 12:12.220
Dr. Linkletter,
I'm dropping your class

12:12.305 --> 12:14.005
and switching my major
to philosophy.

12:14.090 --> 12:15.787
Uh, what?

12:21.175 --> 12:23.691
It's funny. This morning,
I couldn't get out of bed,

12:23.776 --> 12:26.690
and now I stand before a whole
new exciting field of study.

12:27.019 --> 12:30.243
Well, maybe instead
of making this big switch,

12:30.327 --> 12:31.706
you could study both.

12:31.791 --> 12:34.666
You could be
physics-philosophy guy.

12:34.751 --> 12:36.643
You sound like
a logical positivist.

12:36.728 --> 12:38.429
That's a branch of philosophy
that maintains

12:38.513 --> 12:40.714
the best way to philosophize
is through science.

12:40.799 --> 12:43.057
Well, there you go.
Do that.

12:43.368 --> 12:45.042
It may be too early
to specialize.

12:45.127 --> 12:47.567
I've only been a philosopher
for 15 minutes.

12:48.374 --> 12:51.565
Did you notice Dr. Linkletter
didn't look too thrilled

12:51.650 --> 12:53.135
about you leaving science?

12:53.220 --> 12:54.730
He never looks thrilled
about anything.

12:54.814 --> 12:57.211
I think that's
just his face.

12:58.746 --> 13:00.534
That's the face.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.531
Why the hell weren't
you at practice?

13:06.616 --> 13:08.012
Can't talk right now.
I'm working.

13:08.334 --> 13:10.205
Well, you're gonna
talk about it.

13:11.308 --> 13:12.854
What do you want from me?

13:12.939 --> 13:15.089
I don't want to play football.
I want to work.

13:15.581 --> 13:18.004
You have your whole life
to hold down a job.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.776
Hey,
I like my job.

13:19.861 --> 13:21.682
It's not my problem
you hate yours.

13:27.802 --> 13:29.325
Do whatever you want.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.723
<i>To figure out</i>

13:31.808 --> 13:33.809
<i>which school of philosophy
suited me best,</i>

13:33.894 --> 13:36.421
<i>I decided to sample each one.</i>

13:36.506 --> 13:39.692
<i>The same way I determined
my favorite flavor of oatmeal...</i>

13:39.786 --> 13:41.223
<i>Plain.</i>

13:44.464 --> 13:45.848
What are you doing?

13:45.933 --> 13:48.187
I'm practicing the
philosophy of cynicism...

13:48.272 --> 13:49.544
The ancient Greek view

13:49.629 --> 13:51.895
that the rules of society
should be ignored.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.427
If you're gonna break rules,
you can do better than that.

13:54.512 --> 13:55.856
How?

13:58.094 --> 13:59.620
<i>Renaissance humanism is</i>

13:59.737 --> 14:02.743
<i>finding meaning

14:03.488 --> 14:05.238
- Can I move?
- No.

14:05.437 --> 14:06.833
But my butt itches.

14:06.918 --> 14:08.895
Scratch it on your own time.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.346
<i>Nihilists believe</i>

14:13.431 --> 14:14.741
<i>that there's no point
to anything,</i>

14:14.825 --> 14:16.633
<i>because it all ends
in nothingness.</i>

14:16.733 --> 14:18.219
Mind if I put on MTV?

14:18.304 --> 14:20.571
Doesn't matter.
We're all gonna die anyway.

14:20.672 --> 14:22.391
Deep thought, dingus.

14:22.476 --> 14:24.655
<i>Traditionalism is the philosophy</i>

14:24.740 --> 14:27.777
<i>that the best way of life
is a return to the past.</i>

14:27.862 --> 14:29.157
What are you doing?

14:29.242 --> 14:32.770
Making my own butter,
like in olden times.

14:32.923 --> 14:34.774
That's stupid.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.501
<i>My arms are still sore.</i>

14:37.896 --> 14:40.305
Altruism is the belief
that we should live

14:40.390 --> 14:42.831
only by bringing happiness
to others.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.102
These are for you.

14:44.198 --> 14:45.419
Thanks.

14:45.635 --> 14:46.944
What the hell?!

14:47.154 --> 14:48.751
<i>Egoism is the belief</i>

14:48.836 --> 14:51.665
that we should live only by
bringing happiness to ourselves.

14:51.755 --> 14:53.407
Mmm.
These are pretty good.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.503
<i>Transcendentalists were</i>

14:55.588 --> 14:58.159
<i>philosophers who believed
that our deepest connection</i>

14:58.244 --> 15:00.032
<i>is with nature.</i>

15:00.938 --> 15:02.180
Eh.

15:08.773 --> 15:10.485
I'm beautiful.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.448
And then Georgie accuses me

15:14.532 --> 15:15.805
of hating my job.

15:16.184 --> 15:18.555
Is this where
I thought I'd end up? No.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.579
Is this where
you thought you'd end up?

15:20.664 --> 15:22.815
I thought I'd be working

15:24.468 --> 15:25.995
My life turned out great.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.977
Well, good for you.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.711
The worst part is,
I think Georgie's right.

15:33.711 --> 15:34.954
You're not happy at work?

15:35.039 --> 15:36.739
I can see if my
dad's hiring.

15:36.993 --> 15:38.389
How are your sewing skills?

15:38.707 --> 15:40.782
It's not work.

15:42.510 --> 15:45.366
Honestly, I don't know
if I'm happy anywhere.

15:47.970 --> 15:51.019
Ugh. When I asked y'all

16:26.902 --> 16:28.695
I don't know

16:28.780 --> 16:30.500
but you're here
on a physics scholarship,

16:30.585 --> 16:33.635
and switching to philosophy
may not be well-received.

16:33.720 --> 16:34.902
Ordinarily, I'd be concerned,
