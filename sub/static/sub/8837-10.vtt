WEBVTT

01:55.156 --> 01:57.616
WHY ARE YOU BOUNCING
ON THE BED IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT?

01:57.784 --> 02:00.744
GOT TO GO TALK TO PA.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.997
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING YOUR
STOCKINGS IN YOUR SHOES?

02:04.165 --> 02:05.415
BECAUSE I WANT TO.

02:05.583 --> 02:09.086
BESIDES,
I ALWAYS DO IT, ANYWAY.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.504
YOU DO NOT.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.965
YES, I DO.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.508
IF I PUT MY STOCKINGS ON

02:14.676 --> 02:16.301
AND THEN PUT MY FEET
IN THE SHOES,

02:16.469 --> 02:22.391
IT WOULD BE THE SAME
THING AS PUTTING MY
STOCKINGS IN THE SHOES.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.769
THERE. HOW DO I LOOK?

02:25.937 --> 02:28.105
SAME AS WHEN
WE WENT TO BED...

02:28.273 --> 02:31.233
EXCEPT FOR THAT
DUMB-LOOKING NIGHTCAP.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.152
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.945
I'M TALLER.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.281
GO TO SLEEP.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.408
I WAS ASLEEP.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.381
PA?

02:54.549 --> 02:57.301
HEY, HALF-PINT,
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU
DOING UP THIS LATE?

02:57.468 --> 02:59.303
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.096
WELL, IT BETTER BE
DARN IMPORTANT.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.140
OH, IT IS.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.058
I'M GETTING
BIGGER, PA--

03:05.226 --> 03:07.519
MORE THAN
A WHOLE INCH BIGGER.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.479
FROM THE LOOKS OF YOU,
YOU'RE DOING
MOST OF YOUR GROWING

03:09.647 --> 03:11.315
ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.649
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT
TOMORROW MORNING.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.818
WHY DON'T YOU GET
SOME SLEEP?

03:14.986 --> 03:16.695
BUT YOU'RE
GOING HUNTING
TOMORROW MORNING.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.155
I WAS AFRAID
I MIGHT MISS YOU.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.698
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.617
EDWARDS IS TAKING
A FREIGHTING RUN TOMORROW.

03:21.784 --> 03:25.370
HE'S GOING TO DROP ME
OFF AT MORGAN CREEK.
I'LL WALK IN FROM THERE.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.663
NOW, COME ON, GIVE ME
A KISS GOOD NIGHT.

03:26.831 --> 03:29.458
I WANT YOU TO GET
SOME SLEEP.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.876
[KISSES LOUDLY]

03:31.044 --> 03:32.502
YOU LIKE HUNTING,
DON'T YOU, PA?

03:32.670 --> 03:34.755
WELL, IT'S KIND OF
A GOOD EXCUSE TO GET
TO THE MOUNTAINS.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.424
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
IS WE NEED THE MEAT.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.052
YOU SAID
THAT I COULD GO
WHEN I GOT BIGGER.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.679
WELL, YOU CAN.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.181
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.391
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
LAST TIME.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.019
WELL, WHAT I MEANT WAS,
WHEN YOU GET OLDER,
NOT BIGGER.

03:49.187 --> 03:53.941
WELL, I AM OLDER...
AND MORE THAN
A WHOLE INCH BIGGER.

03:54.108 --> 03:56.693
OH...

03:56.861 --> 04:00.113
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS
ALL ABOUT, HUH?

04:00.281 --> 04:03.492
I'M ALL CAUGHT UP
ON MY CHORES, AND
MY SCHOOLWORK, TOO.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.536
HALF-PINT, YOU KNOW
HOW YOUR MA FEELS ABOUT
GIRLS GOING HUNTING.

04:06.704 --> 04:10.123
IN YOUR MA'S BOOK,
A GIRL HAS A LOT MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.334
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
IN YOUR BOOK?

04:12.502 --> 04:15.254
IN MY BOOK, YOU'RE
PUTTING ME ON THE SPOT.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.048
THAT'S BECAUSE
I WANT TO GO.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.760
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL ASK YOUR MA.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.137
- THANKS.
- BUT OFF TO BED NOW!

04:24.305 --> 04:25.931
- OKAY.
- OKAY, GO!

04:44.033 --> 04:45.033
ARE YOU ALL FINISHED?

04:45.201 --> 04:47.577
YEP, ALL FINISHED.
I'M READY TO GO.

04:47.745 --> 04:50.289
GREAT. YOU GET
SOME SLEEP NOW.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.666
YEAH.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.918
OH, YOU KNOW, I ALMOST
FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.878
HALF-PINT IS
A WHOLE INCH TALLER.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.088
MM-HMM.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.882
HARD TO BELIEVE THE WAY
THAT GIRL IS GROWING.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.926
UH-HUH.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.595
I MEAN, YOU PRACTICALLY
SEE HER GROWING EVERY DAY.

05:05.763 --> 05:10.934
MM-HMM. I'LL LET
HER HEMS DOWN TOMORROW.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.187
WHY DON'T YOU LET HER
GO HUNTING TOMORROW?

05:14.355 --> 05:15.564
WHAT?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.566
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LET HER GO
HUNTING TOMORROW?

05:17.734 --> 05:18.942
AND SHE KNOWS HER WAY
AROUND THE WOODS.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.777
SHE CAN BE A BIG HELP
TO ME IN THE CAMP.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.237
I DON'T WANT HER
GOING HUNTING.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.781
WHY NOT?

05:24.949 --> 05:27.993
SHE'S TOMBOY ENOUGH
AS IT IS, CHARLES,
WITHOUT ENCOURAGING HER.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.411
THAT'S JUST THE POINT.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.163
SHE'S GOING TO BE
A WOMAN THE REST
OF HER LIFE.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.748
WHY DON'T WE LET HER
BE A TOMBOY
A LITTLE BIT LONGER?

05:32.915 --> 05:34.541
YOU MARK MY WORDS,
ONE OF THESE DAYS,

05:34.709 --> 05:36.752
SHE'S GOING TO WALK
IN THAT DOOR, SHE'LL
BE A FULL-GROWN WOMAN,

05:36.919 --> 05:39.671
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
"WHERE'S THAT LITTLE
GIRL I USED TO HAVE?"

05:39.839 --> 05:43.300
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
SHE'S A GIRL, NOT A BOY.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.968
I DON'T WANT HER THERE.
IT'S NOT PROPER.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.720
OH, CAROLINE,
I PROMISED HER,

05:46.888 --> 05:48.305
AND THEN SHE KEPT ASKING
ME, AND I PROMISED--

05:48.473 --> 05:51.475
Laura:
PA, DID YOU ASK HER?

05:51.642 --> 05:53.769
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

05:56.522 --> 05:58.732
WELL, IT'S YOUR DECISION.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.567
YOU TELL HER.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.049
Edwards:
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.343
RISKY THING,
TAKING A WOMAN ALONG
ON A HUNTING TRIP.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.303
HALF-PINT'S HARDLY
A FULL-GROWN WOMAN YET.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.721
THAT DON'T MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.516
FEMALE'S A FEMALE--
BIG, LITTLE, OR IN-BETWEEN.

06:32.683 --> 06:33.892
BAD LUCK.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.352
ALL BAD LUCK,
ARE THEY, HUH?

06:35.520 --> 06:38.480
WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S AN EXCEPTION
NOW AND AGAIN.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.357
I KNEW THIS INDIAN
ONE. CHEYENNE.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.442
HE USED TO TAKE HIS
SQUAW ALONG ON
HUNT TRIPS WITH HIM.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.027
THE FACT IS HE WOULDN'T
GO WITHOUT HER.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.362
WAS A REAL
GOOD HUNTER, HUH?

06:45.530 --> 06:46.988
OH, SKINNER.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.907
THAT SQUAW
COULD SKIN OUT AND DRESS

06:49.075 --> 06:51.201
4 OR 5 BUFFALOS BETWEEN
LUNCH AND SUPPER.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.911
YOU THINK I CAN PUT
HALF-PINT TO SKINNING?

06:53.079 --> 06:56.039
DON'T KNOW WHY NOT.
SHE'S LITTLE,
BUT SHE'S STRONG.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT, HALF-PINT?

06:58.668 --> 06:59.709
YUCK!

06:59.877 --> 07:02.003
[BOTH LAUGH]

07:26.654 --> 07:27.821
THAT'LL DO IT.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.906
GET MOVING, YOU TWO.
I GOT A LOAD TO MOVE.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.658
WE'RE MUCH OBLIGED
FOR THE RIDE.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.285
- SUNDAY, NOON, HUH?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.287
IF WE'RE NOT
HERE RIGHT AWAY,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT US.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.913
OH, WELL, I'LL JUST
FIGURE LAURA HERE

07:37.081 --> 07:39.040
AIN'T AS QUICK
WITH THAT SKINNING
AS SHE OUGHT TO BE.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.542
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT, HALF-PINT?

07:40.710 --> 07:41.751
- YUCK!
- YUCK!

07:41.919 --> 07:43.420
HERE. LET ME GIVE YOU
A HAND WITH THAT.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.589
HERE YOU GO.
SLIP YOUR ARM
RIGHT THROUGH THERE.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.424
OOPS! THE FLAP'S
OPEN BACK HERE.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.135
BETTER TIE
THAT DOWN.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.220
THERE. HOW'S
THAT FEEL?

07:52.388 --> 07:54.097
IT FEELS HEAVIER THAN
I EXPECTED IT TO BE.

07:54.265 --> 07:57.767
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS
LIKE THAT THE FIRST DAY--
HELP YOU DOWNHILL.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.187
THERE YOU GO.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.771
HAPPY HUNTING.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.064

WE'LL SEE YOU SUNDAY!

08:08.613 --> 08:09.946
BYE!

08:18.539 --> 08:19.581

08:19.749 --> 08:21.708

WAS AN FINE OLD MAN

08:31.594 --> 08:33.428

IN A FRYIN' PAN

08:33.596 --> 08:36.389

WITH A WAGON WHEEL...

COME ON, HALF-PINT!

08:51.030 --> 08:52.572
COMING!

08:58.788 --> 08:59.955
WE'LL DO MOST OF
OUR CLIMBING TODAY--

09:00.122 --> 09:01.998
ALL THE WAY UP
TO THE TOP OF THE RIDGE.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.667
CAN YOU HANDLE THAT
ALL RIGHT?

09:03.834 --> 09:06.294
- YES, SIR!
- GOOD.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.217
YOU SURE YOU'RE
NOT TOO TIRED?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.927
NO, SIR.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.389

THE LEAST BIT
TIRED AT ALL.

WHOA! OUCH!

09:22.019 --> 09:23.603
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:23.771 --> 09:25.564
I DON'T KNOW.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.024
THERE'S SOMETHING
HARD IN MY PACK.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.402
THERE CAN'T
BE NOTHING
HARD IN THERE.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.239
ALL I PACKED WAS
AN EXTRA CHANGE
OF CLOTHES!

TO BE NICE AND HOT.

BETTER AND TASTE BETTER

10:37.011 --> 10:39.512
WHEN YOU'RE OUT
IN THE WOODS LIKE THIS.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.432
IT SURE DOES.
I LOVE IT.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.892

10:44.060 --> 10:46.061
BEST TIME
I EVER HAD.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.937
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU TODAY.

10:48.105 --> 10:51.274
WE DID A LOT OF TRAVELING.
I WAS AFRAID FOR A WHILE
YOU WOULDN'T MAKE IT.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.776
WELL, SURE, I WOULD.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.445
I COULD WALK
ALL THE WAY TO CHINA
IF I HAD TO.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.740
I'M AFRAID YOU'D LOSE ME
ON A TRIP LIKE THAT.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.076
WELL, I WOULDN'T GO
WITHOUT YOU.

THIS IS DIFFERENT.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.254
IT'S JUST YOU
AND ME.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.799
IT'S NOT
LIKE AT HOME.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.677
PROMISE NOT
TO LAUGH IF I TELL
YOU SOMETHING?

11:18.844 --> 11:20.512
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ONE
OF YOUR CHERRY TREE JOKES.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.721
IT'S NOT.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.057
ALL RIGHT,
THEN I PROMISE.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.226
WELL...

11:26.394 --> 11:28.436
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

11:28.604 --> 11:32.190
I USED TO THINK
THAT I'D MARRY
YOU SOMEDAY.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.775

11:33.943 --> 11:36.528
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS SILLY,

11:36.696 --> 11:38.488

OF SILLY THINGS
SOMETIMES

11:38.656 --> 11:39.698
WHEN YOU ARE LITTLE.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.701
YEAH. I GUESS WE ALL DID.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.744
WELL, THEN I GOT
TO THINKING

11:44.912 --> 11:47.497
THAT I COULD GROW UP
TO BE A BOY.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.499
THAT WAY, WE COULD
HUNT AND PLOW,

11:49.667 --> 11:52.419
AND BE TOGETHER
ALMOST ALL THE TIME.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.671
BUT NOW THAT
I'M GROWN UP,

11:54.839 --> 11:57.424
I THINK
THAT'S SILLY.

11:57.591 --> 11:58.508
WELL...

11:58.676 --> 12:01.678
BUT BEING OUT HERE,
JUST YOU AND ME...

BOTH THOSE THINGS.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.724

WHAT I MEAN?

12:05.891 --> 12:07.517
I THINK SO.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.478
I CAN REMEMBER I USED
TO THINK SILLY THINGS
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

12:10.646 --> 12:15.650
I'LL TELL YOU, I WAS SURE
MY PA WAS THE STRONGEST
MAN IN THE WORLD,

12:15.818 --> 12:17.444
AND I KNEW MY MA
WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.362
I MEAN, SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
LIKE THE QUEENS

12:19.530 --> 12:22.907
OF THOSE COUNTRIES
IN EUROPE AND STUFF.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.202

YOU LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENT.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.956

IN THE BIG WOODS WHEN...

12:30.124 --> 12:31.833
WHEN I SAW YOUR MA.

12:32.001 --> 12:35.378

YOU TALK ABOUT PRETTY.

USE HER MYSELF.

A FEW DAYS LATE.

I WISH I COULD
OFFER YOU SOME, BUT
WE DIDN'T PACK ANY IN.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.296
OH, GLOVER WILL
BE HERE SOON ENOUGH.

14:41.463 --> 14:42.547
HE'S THE ONLY TRADER
IN THESE PARTS,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.132
SO WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH CHOICE.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.050
BUT WE GOT SOME GOOD
SMOKED MEAT IF YOU

YOU HAVEN'T HAD
A BITE TO EAT ALL DAY.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.049

I DON'T WANT NONE!

15:26.216 --> 15:28.593
SUIT YOURSELF.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.386

15:54.620 --> 15:56.829
WE GO THROUGH THAT
EVERY TIME, TOO.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.279

ALL THERE IS.

ONE AT A TIME.
