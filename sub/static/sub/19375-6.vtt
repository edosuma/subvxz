JUST A BIT, SO WE ADDED A
LITTLE TOUCH OF NICKEL PLATING

38:16.137 --> 38:17.586
TO BREAK UP THE PATINA.

38:17.586 --> 38:19.896
THAT COMBINED WITH THE LARGER,
COMMERCIAL HEADLIGHTS

38:19.896 --> 38:22.275
WE STOLE OFF A BIG TRUCK,
AND THE PAINT WE SPLASHED

38:22.275 --> 38:24.551
ON THE WHEELS, WELL, THIS
TRUCK'S REALLY SET OFF.

38:27.275 --> 38:29.103
KEEPING MOST OF THE ORIGINAL
LOOK OF THE EXTERIOR

38:29.103 --> 38:30.655
WAS THE RIGHT CALL,
BUT THE REST OF THE TRUCK

38:30.655 --> 38:32.344
WAS A DIFFERENT STORY.

38:32.344 --> 38:34.413
WE UPDATED THE CHASSIS
AND INTERIOR TO MAKE THIS

38:34.413 --> 38:37.241
THE MOST COMFORTABLE, BADASS
DRIVING '33 TRUCK AROUND.

38:38.896 --> 38:41.448
I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES BEFORE,
I WISH I COULD KEEP THEM ALL,

38:41.448 --> 38:43.482
BUT I'VE ALSO SAID MANY TIMES
BEFORE THAT I GOTTA SELL

38:43.482 --> 38:45.241
THESE CARS TO KEEP
THE BUSINESS GOING.

38:45.241 --> 38:46.965
SO IT'D BE COOL TO
KEEP THIS '33 AROUND

38:46.965 --> 38:48.310
TO USE AS A SHOP
TRUCK, BUT YOU KNOW

38:48.310 --> 38:49.655
WHAT'S EVEN COOLER THAN THAT?

38:49.655 --> 38:51.241
A FAT STACK OF CASH IN MY HANDS.

38:51.241 --> 38:54.482
SORRY MONKEYS, NO
'33 TRUCK FOR YOU.
