WEBVTT

00:03.307 --> 00:04.700
Previously onMom...I just don'’t know
what to expect.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.528
Have any of you ever
dated a handicapped guy?

00:06.615 --> 00:09.139
When I was in high school,
my boyfriend had a glass eye.

00:09.226 --> 00:10.271
Was it a problem?

00:10.358 --> 00:11.794
No, I loved it.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.839
If I was having a bad hair day
or a giant zit,

00:13.926 --> 00:15.276
I'’d just stand
on his blind side.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.018
Bonnie, it'’s just dinner.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.194
I don'’t think you have to worry
about any of that stuff.

00:20.281 --> 00:22.500
Speaking of stuff,
what about his stuff?

00:22.587 --> 00:24.067
What if his stuff doesn'’t work?

00:24.154 --> 00:25.982
That doesn'’t mean
you can'’t have fun.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.550
Yeah. His tongue'’s
not in a wheelchair.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.988
Thanks. This is perfect.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.819
Do people always stare at you?

00:36.906 --> 00:38.603
[chuckles]
What are you talking about?

00:38.690 --> 00:40.170
They'’re staring at you.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.954
Stop.
I'’m serious.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.044
You'’re a giant.
They think you might eat them.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.439
I'’m gonna have a beer.
Does it bother you if I drink?

00:48.526 --> 00:50.659
Does it bother you if I walk?

00:50.746 --> 00:53.923
Not if you'’re in front of me.
I like the view from back there.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.838
Good answer.

00:57.318 --> 00:58.536
Yee-haw!

00:58.623 --> 01:00.538
[whoops]

01:00.625 --> 01:02.758
[laughing]
This is fun.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.934
Uh, hang on.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.936
Oh. Now you'’re
just showing off.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.939
[laughter]

01:10.026 --> 01:11.245
Tonight was great.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.942
Can we do it again?

01:13.029 --> 01:13.986
We better.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.684
Good.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.994
This is awesome.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.128
Makes getting stuff
from the kitchen so much easier.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.738
That'’s what I say every day.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.914
"This wheelchair
sure is convenient."

01:29.001 --> 01:31.134
I'’m sorry.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.093
Am I getting toocomfortable
with you?

01:33.180 --> 01:34.746
No, I like it.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.574
In fact, how would you feel

01:36.661 --> 01:38.881
about going away
with me for a few days?

01:38.968 --> 01:41.144
Really? What'’d you have in mind?

01:41.231 --> 01:43.755
A long weekend in Cabo.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.714
Ooh, sounds nice.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.803
Are we at that point
in our relationship?

01:47.890 --> 01:49.457
I'’m gonna go out
on a limb and say

01:49.544 --> 01:50.675
that we could
tolerate each other

01:50.762 --> 01:51.981
for four days
and three nights, babe.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.897
That sounds about right.

01:54.984 --> 01:58.292
Okay, challenge accepted.

01:58.379 --> 02:01.121
Oh, my God--
old people kissing. So cute.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.732
You ready to go?

02:03.819 --> 02:05.168
Oh, geez, it'’s 6:30.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.213
Where you going?

02:06.300 --> 02:07.518
We'’ve got a meeting.

02:07.605 --> 02:08.737
You just had
a meeting last night.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.130
I know, but then
I woke up today

02:10.217 --> 02:12.915
and I was still
an alcoholic.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.090
Why don'’t you hang
out till I get back?

02:14.177 --> 02:15.265
The meeting'’s only an hour.

02:15.352 --> 02:16.614
Really? Are we at
the "leave me alone

02:16.701 --> 02:18.312
in your apartment" point
of the relationship?

02:18.399 --> 02:20.966
Better you concern yourself
with how we share a bathroom

02:21.053 --> 02:23.186
in Mexico for four
days and three nights.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.710
I'’ll make sure
to bring matches and a candle.

02:25.797 --> 02:28.974
Oh, you'’re so romantic.
Oh.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.106
Let'’s roll.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.847
Be back before
you know it.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.153
Have fun not drinking.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.590
How doyou share
a hotel bathroom

02:35.677 --> 02:37.244
for four days
and three nights?

02:37.331 --> 02:39.724
You don'’t. You go to the
Starbucks in the lobby

02:39.811 --> 02:42.031
and destroy
the one there.

02:42.118 --> 02:44.033
♪

03:01.398 --> 03:04.358
Uh, I'’m Travis.
I'’m a drug addict.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.229
ALL:
Hi, Travis.

03:06.316 --> 03:10.842
I have, uh... five days sober?

03:12.931 --> 03:15.282
I don'’t really know
what I'’m supposed to say.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.371
You know things have gotten bad

03:17.458 --> 03:19.677
when your drug dealer tells you
you need help.

03:21.766 --> 03:24.378
This isn'’t the first time
I tried to get clean, either.

03:24.465 --> 03:28.643
I-I had a couple months
a while back.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.123
Even had a girlfriend.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.168
Life was pretty good.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.823
And then...

03:34.910 --> 03:38.348
I don'’t know.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.698
I thought I could get high

03:40.785 --> 03:43.527
every once in a while,

03:43.614 --> 03:47.575
and I convinced her
that she could, too.

03:47.662 --> 03:50.186
Some of you might
have known her.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.840
I think
she came to this meeting.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.798
I'’m...

03:53.885 --> 03:56.410
pretty sure that'’s
what she told me.Oh, God. Travis.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.976
My memory is...That'’s Jodi'’s
boyfriend.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.717
...messed up
these days.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.197
Anyway,

04:01.284 --> 04:04.722
I just can'’t live like this
anymore.

04:04.809 --> 04:06.942
Part of me is scared
I'’m gonna die.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.687
And part of me
is scared I won'’t.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.819
[sniffles]
That'’s all I got.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.738
Who else would
like to share?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.310
I don'’t know about
the rest of you,

04:27.397 --> 04:29.530
but I want to kick the
crap out of that guy.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.184
Yeah, like a hundred pounds
of you is gonna hurt somebody.

04:32.272 --> 04:36.276
Excuse me, but I have a beast
mode you don'’t know about.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.887
What have I always told you?
A lady doesn'’t use her fists.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.368
That'’s what
cars are for.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.544
That'’s not gonna
bring Jodi back.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.850
Yeah, but it might
stop that dirtbag

04:45.937 --> 04:47.330
from killing
someone else.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.767
Look, I miss Jodi
as much as you all do,

04:49.854 --> 04:51.856
but Travis didn'’t kill her.
Her addiction did.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.642
Why can'’t you be a normal person
and just hate?

04:54.729 --> 04:56.774
Oh, believe me,
I have my moments.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.690
Like every time
you open your mouth.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.867
Let'’s go, old woman.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.087
I will toss you
like a salad.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.785
Everybody
just settle down.

05:07.872 --> 05:09.221
Yeah, let'’s not forget.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.962
Travis didn'’t hold a gun
to Jodi'’s head

05:11.049 --> 05:12.616
and make her shoot up.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.792
Yeah, but he brought drugs
over to the apartment

05:14.879 --> 05:16.881
of someone who was
barely six months sober.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.188
Yeah, and now he'’s trying
to get sober,

05:19.275 --> 05:21.233
and our job is to help him.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.844
Which is why

05:22.931 --> 05:24.802
I encouraged him to come back.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.849
Wait. You told him to
come back to our meeting?

05:27.936 --> 05:29.111
Yes, I did.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.548
You know, we all
follow you around

05:31.635 --> 05:33.768
like you'’re this
great wise woman,

05:33.855 --> 05:35.639
but maybe you'’re
just a lunatic.

05:35.726 --> 05:38.120
You want to run him over
with a car, but I'’m the lunatic?

05:38.207 --> 05:40.601
Not run him over,
just send a message.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.038
Come on, back me up here.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.648
I'’m sorry.
I agree with Marjorie.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.129
[sighs]
Me, too.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.174
Okay, Christy, it'’s
just you and me.

05:49.261 --> 05:52.439
Oh, that'’s never
a good thing.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.314
Let'’s talk
about happy things.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.838
Bonnie, how'’s it going
with your boyfriend?

06:00.925 --> 06:02.840
[gasps]
I forgot my boyfriend!

06:04.886 --> 06:07.802
Oh, don'’t come home for a while.
I have some making up to do.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.896
I am so sorry.
Yeah, me, too.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.288
Please don'’t go.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.899
You said you'’d be right back.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.770
I'’m sitting in there
for three and a half hours

06:19.857 --> 06:22.251
with no booze
and nothing but basic cable.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.687
I-I know. I-I'’m-I'’m sorry.

06:23.774 --> 06:24.993
I just...
I got caught up in something.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.168
Yeah, well,
clearly these meetings

06:26.255 --> 06:27.212
are more important than me.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.649
Adam, wait.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.651
I did my waiting.
Three and a half hours.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.828
Come on, le-let me
make it up to you.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.917
What do you got in mind?

06:36.004 --> 06:38.702
Uh, how about I rock your world

06:38.789 --> 06:41.139
while you just lay back
and watch ESPN?

06:41.226 --> 06:43.925
You don'’t have ESPN.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.318
Fine. I'’ll just yell out scores.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.668
That'’ll work.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.453
Hey, instead of you

06:50.540 --> 06:52.324
sitting around,
wondering what I'’m doing

06:52.412 --> 06:54.152
at these meetings, why don'’t
you come with me one night

06:54.239 --> 06:55.545
and see for yourself?

06:55.632 --> 06:57.504
You want me to go
to an AA meeting?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.288
Yeah, just as
an observer.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.377
Huh.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.945
Uh, I don'’t want to jeopardize
the really hot sex

07:04.032 --> 07:08.166
we'’re about to have,
but that sounds just awful.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.299
Oh, come on.
It'’ll be fun.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.214
You'’ll meet some
interesting women,

07:12.301 --> 07:14.042
you'’ll hear a lot of
inspiring stories.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.435
You might even cry.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.654
Oh, God,
it'’s basic cable all over again.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.917
This way.Where are we going?

07:20.004 --> 07:21.919
We'’re gonna use the bed
in my grandson'’s room.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.791
Wow, way to talk dirty to me.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.314
[grunts]

07:27.882 --> 07:29.797
Here you go.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.581
Thank you.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.627
You have coffee and cookies
before the meeting

07:33.714 --> 07:35.411
and coffee and dessert after?

07:35.498 --> 07:37.805
Moderation'’s not
our strong suit.

07:37.892 --> 07:41.504
So, Adam, Bonnie tells me
you were a stuntman.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.245
Work with any big stars?

07:43.332 --> 07:45.900
I doubled Bruce Willis
on a few films.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.946
Really? Do you know how
to get in touch with him?

07:49.033 --> 07:51.645
[laughing]:
I think he'’s married.

07:51.732 --> 07:54.082
I didn'’t ask that.

07:55.431 --> 07:56.824
I think it'’s
just great

07:56.911 --> 08:01.698
you came to the meeting
to support Bonnie.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.918
but she can be very persuasive.

08:04.005 --> 08:06.747
Twice.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.750
Hey.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.969
How'’s it going?Good. You?

08:12.056 --> 08:13.188
Still breathing.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.277
Great. Good.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.061
Glad you'’re still breathing.

08:24.112 --> 08:26.027
I want you to know something.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.116
I was Jodi'’s sponsor,
and I really loved her,

08:28.203 --> 08:29.726
and I wish
she was still breathing,

08:29.813 --> 08:31.162
but because of you, she isn'’t,

08:31.249 --> 08:32.947
and I will never
forgive you for it.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.777
Got it.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.561
Yeah.

08:38.648 --> 08:41.912
Run away!
Like you did when she was dying!

08:54.142 --> 08:55.709
So, now that I'’m sober,

08:55.796 --> 08:58.538
I'’m able to take
care of myself and

08:58.625 --> 09:02.019
keep a job and pay my bills.

09:02.106 --> 09:06.546
In fact, after a lifetime
of riding the bus,

09:06.633 --> 09:10.637
I just bought myself
my first ever new car.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.466
Then it started having
all these problems,

09:14.554 --> 09:16.817
and I don'’t know what to do.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.166
How about take it
back to the dealer?

09:18.253 --> 09:19.471
It'’s still
under warranty.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.300
[shushing]When I start

09:22.387 --> 09:25.652
the car in the morning
and turn the heater on,

09:25.739 --> 09:28.437
cold air comes out.

09:28.524 --> 09:30.439
All cars do that.
The engine'’s cold.

09:30.526 --> 09:33.137
[shushing]But that'’s okay.

09:33.224 --> 09:37.011
I just bundle up
and ask God for guidance.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.665
You don'’t need God.
You just need to let

09:38.752 --> 09:39.970
the freakin'’
car warm up.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.495
We don'’t give advice.
We just listen.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.106
Then why are we here?

09:45.193 --> 09:46.150
Anyway,

09:46.237 --> 09:48.544
thanks for letting me share.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.633
[applause]

09:50.720 --> 09:52.592
Why is everybody
clapping? She'’s stupid.

09:52.679 --> 09:56.160
I mean...Shh!

09:57.727 --> 09:59.555
Hi, I'’m Jill.
I'’m an alcoholic.

09:59.642 --> 10:02.253
ALL:
Hi, Jill.

10:02.340 --> 10:06.257
I'’ve been feeling
really lonely lately.

10:06.344 --> 10:09.957
So I think I might adopt one
of those little Chinese babies.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.436
Oh, for God'’s sake...

10:17.573 --> 10:20.358
Okay. I just
got to say it.

10:20.445 --> 10:24.841
I have never wanted a
drink more in my life.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.497
Well, AA is
just not for you.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.412
How is it for anybody?

10:30.499 --> 10:32.762
Listening to people'’s problems
and then not helping them.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.243
It gives you perspective
on your own life.

10:35.330 --> 10:38.072
You realize you'’re not
the only one who has problems.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.509
Really? You thought other people
don'’t have problems?

10:40.596 --> 10:43.294
Do you get out much?
Have you met other people?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.907
There'’s more to it
than that.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.473
Hey, I got a great idea.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.562
Instead of blowing me off
to go to these meetings,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.869
you tell me your problems,
I won'’t help you,

10:52.956 --> 10:54.131
and then I'’ll clap.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.311
I'’ll tell you
my problem.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.487
My boyfriend'’s being
a real jerk.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.489
Hang on.

11:10.278 --> 11:13.150
Would anyone else
like to share?

11:13.237 --> 11:15.152
Anybody?

11:18.242 --> 11:19.548
Sorry.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.767
Where'’s Adam?

11:20.854 --> 11:23.334
He'’s, uh, processing
the meeting.

11:23.421 --> 11:24.379
What does that mean?

11:24.466 --> 11:26.381
He'’s at a bar drinking.

11:26.468 --> 11:29.645
Hey, did anybody see that Travis
boy at the meeting tonight?

11:29.732 --> 11:32.256
Yeah. He was out in the hallway
when I came in.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.432
Huh. I wonder
why he didn'’t stay.

11:34.519 --> 11:38.349
I wonder why we'’re not talking
about Jill'’s new Chinese baby.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.351
I'’m not 100%
on Chinese.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.485
I could see myself toting around
a little India baby.

11:43.572 --> 11:46.009
You know, you might want
to start by adopting a dog

11:46.096 --> 11:47.576
and see how that goes.

11:47.663 --> 11:51.406
Oh, no. Dogs are
so high-maintenance.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.930
Oh, damn it.

11:55.410 --> 11:58.630
Travis didn'’t come
to the meeting

11:58.718 --> 12:00.850
Oh, Christy.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.113
I'’m sorry,
I just couldn'’t help it.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.116
Well, you know
what you got to do now.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.684
No. I am not apologizing
to that kid.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.860
He can rot in hell
for all I care.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.732
Really? Is that the kind
of person you want to be?

12:12.819 --> 12:15.299
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.085
I'’m proud of you. I
wouldn'’t apologize either.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.958
[groans]

12:24.569 --> 12:27.442
Do I know my
little girl?

12:27.529 --> 12:29.444
[rock music playing]

12:36.538 --> 12:38.235
Hi. Travis?

12:38.322 --> 12:40.585
Seriously?

12:42.065 --> 12:43.588
What do you want?

12:43.675 --> 12:45.155
Can we talk?

12:45.242 --> 12:47.244
I'’m working.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.204
Fine. I'’m a customer.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.988
I want to get something pierced.

12:52.075 --> 12:53.337
What would you recommend?

12:53.424 --> 12:54.686
I don'’t know.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.601
Some people get their nose
or tongue.

12:56.688 --> 12:59.691
Both solid ideas,
but I have a job

12:59.779 --> 13:03.217
where people see me
while they'’re eating.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.480
How about another earring?

13:05.567 --> 13:07.177
Perfect.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.657
Take a seat.

13:11.486 --> 13:15.098
Okay, so, first of all,
I owe you an amends.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.797
I should never have said
those terrible things to you

13:17.884 --> 13:19.320
at the meeting.

13:19.407 --> 13:22.323
I'’m still pretty messed up
about Jodi, but...

13:22.410 --> 13:25.065
I shouldn'’t
have taken it out on you.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.458
Okay.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.373
Please keep going
to meetings.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.376
I don'’t care where,
I don'’t care when.

13:32.463 --> 13:34.030
You'’re welcome back
to ours. Just...

13:34.117 --> 13:35.989
Ow!

13:37.251 --> 13:39.340
No warning?

13:39.427 --> 13:42.560
"Ready, set, go" is
for people I like.

13:42.647 --> 13:43.910
Pay at the counter.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.005
Just so you know...

13:54.398 --> 13:56.574
...there is nothing
that anybody could say to me

13:56.661 --> 13:58.707
that'’s worse
than what I say to myself.

14:00.361 --> 14:03.059
For the rest of my life,

14:03.146 --> 14:05.409
I got to live with what I did.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.112
You didn'’t kill her.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.811
She used
because she was an addict,

14:15.898 --> 14:17.944
and that'’s what addicts do.

14:21.077 --> 14:24.341
Do you think it is even possible

14:24.428 --> 14:27.649
for someone as messed up as me
to stay sober?

14:34.221 --> 14:35.613
Come back to the meeting

14:35.700 --> 14:39.095
and I'’ll introduce
you to my mother.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.840
Hey. How do I know
you'’re not faking

14:44.927 --> 14:47.582
the whole paralyzed thing
so I'’m always waiting on you?

14:47.669 --> 14:49.889
Light the couch on fire
and see for yourself.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.282
[laughs]Listen,

14:52.369 --> 14:54.850
I feel kind of bad about
how I acted the other night

14:54.937 --> 14:58.767
after the meeting.Oh, please, don'’t.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.465
about so I can crap
all over it.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.772
[chuckles]Hey, I'’m trying
to apologize.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.426
And I'’m taking advantage of it.

15:05.513 --> 15:08.342
I also think the reason
you don'’t understand

15:08.429 --> 15:10.866
how important AA is to me
is because you don'’t know

15:10.953 --> 15:13.390
what I was like
before I got sober.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.610
What are you saying, there'’s
a crazier version of you?

15:15.697 --> 15:19.875
Let'’s go to the videotape
and find out.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.095
["Canon in D" playing]

15:22.182 --> 15:24.358
Let me fast-forward
to the good part.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.316
[dance music playing]

15:28.101 --> 15:30.277
Back off!

15:30.364 --> 15:33.889
Come on, you douche bags, dance!

15:33.976 --> 15:36.152
You'’re ruining
my daughter'’s wedding!

15:38.328 --> 15:41.462
All right, you'’re a little out
of control, but I'’ve seen worse.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.812
Oh, baby, I'’m
just getting warmed up.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.121
All right! Here we go!

15:48.208 --> 15:50.775
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

15:50.862 --> 15:52.299
Mine! Mine.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.822
Mine!

15:53.909 --> 15:55.171
Give it!

15:55.258 --> 15:57.391
Mine! Mine!

15:58.696 --> 16:01.003
Okay, that was a
little over-the-top.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.309
Wait for it.

16:04.311 --> 16:07.401
Congratulations,
Christy and Baxter!

16:07.488 --> 16:10.360
I'’m next, bitches!

16:14.321 --> 16:16.453
That ain'’t right.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.978
It also ain'’t over.

16:20.370 --> 16:23.721
I just want to apologize
to everyone.

16:23.808 --> 16:27.377
Obviously, this is not how
I wanted my wedding to turn out.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.640
Oh, come on! I had
to punch him!

16:29.727 --> 16:31.425
The bastard
stole my cocaine!

16:31.512 --> 16:33.949
Ask him!
[shouting]

16:35.037 --> 16:38.432
Baxter, why are you taping this?

16:45.178 --> 16:47.832
So, what do you think?

16:47.919 --> 16:51.097
Is there a meeting
now? I'’ll drive you.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.281
We'’re glad you came back
to the meeting, Travis.

17:01.368 --> 17:04.066
Thanks. I hope
I wasn'’t out of line trying

17:04.153 --> 17:05.849
to help that lady with her car.

17:07.983 --> 17:10.333
She just needs
to let it warm up.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.510
My boyfriend
is really gonna like you.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.166
Just so you know, we come here
after almost every meeting,

17:18.253 --> 17:19.994
if you ever want
to hang out.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.692
I'’d like that.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.521
Jodi was always talking
about these cool older ladies

17:24.608 --> 17:26.696
she knew
from the meeting.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.006
She told me a lot of stories.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.878
One of you
is really smart and kind

17:33.965 --> 17:35.750
and helps people
all the time.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.056
Guilty.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.712
And somebody punched a camel?

17:41.799 --> 17:43.714
It was a long time ago.
I was super drunk,

17:43.801 --> 17:45.760
and he wouldn'’t give me
a cigarette.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.763
Who cries all the time?

17:48.850 --> 17:50.765
Yeah, that'’s me!

17:50.852 --> 17:52.419
And she talked

17:52.506 --> 17:54.943
a lot about you, Christy.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.251
And how much she loved you

17:58.338 --> 18:01.819
and how you tried to stop her
from going out with me.

18:02.951 --> 18:05.736
What can I say?

18:05.823 --> 18:07.086
Nothing.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.786
I just wish she listened to you.
