00:07.190 --> 00:10.179
You want to, you know,
like last night?

00:12.974 --> 00:15.208
Global warming
is causing the planet

00:15.243 --> 00:16.410
to rotate more quickly.

00:16.445 --> 00:18.378
You see, time itself
is speeding up.

00:18.414 --> 00:20.480
I want the zero-impact family.

00:20.516 --> 00:22.416
They have a message of change.

00:22.451 --> 00:25.352
We'll rebook the zero-impact
family right away.

00:25.387 --> 00:27.654
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night, darling.

00:27.690 --> 00:30.156
Teddy, where are your pants?

00:30.192 --> 00:31.625
Oh, shit.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.293
- Is Teddy all right?
- He's fine.

00:33.329 --> 00:35.995
He's a hoarder.

00:36.031 --> 00:37.564
Good Lord.

00:37.599 --> 00:39.599
Is that my Queen Elizabeth mug?

00:39.635 --> 00:41.468
I do see you as a mentor.

00:41.503 --> 00:43.470
Like a father mentor.

00:43.505 --> 00:46.606
Sure. I hope to be on the
air someday just like you.

00:46.642 --> 00:49.343
It's healthy to have goals.

01:09.816 --> 01:11.483
Major...

01:11.518 --> 01:14.586
why does your new bidet
still have its bow on?

01:14.621 --> 01:17.489
I'm having second thoughts
about the bidet, Harry.

01:17.524 --> 01:19.290
But why, Major?

01:19.325 --> 01:22.594
All you've been clamoring
about is having your own bidet

01:22.629 --> 01:24.462
ever since we were in Davos.

01:24.498 --> 01:29.133
Well, with this drought,
it seems irresponsible.

01:29.168 --> 01:31.202
And to make matters worse,

01:31.237 --> 01:34.906
I have not delivered a message
of hope about the environment.

01:34.941 --> 01:38.877
Your staff did say such a message
would be difficult to convey, sir.

01:38.912 --> 01:40.678
Well, maybe tonight
will be the night.

01:40.714 --> 01:42.814
The zero-impact family are on.

01:42.849 --> 01:45.850
I know the way
they live is extreme,

01:45.886 --> 01:48.052
but it is those people
on the edge

01:48.087 --> 01:51.856
who will have a chance to
cause a shift in consciousness.

01:53.359 --> 01:55.326
Jesus Christ!

01:55.361 --> 01:58.029
You've made a terrible mess!

01:58.064 --> 02:00.031
You're so clumsy, Martin.

02:00.066 --> 02:01.900
I don't like a clumsy man.

02:01.935 --> 02:03.501
What's wrong with you?!

02:03.537 --> 02:04.769
Rosalie!

02:04.804 --> 02:06.137
Privacy, please.

02:06.172 --> 02:07.438
Walter, I didn't mean
to upset her.

02:07.473 --> 02:10.041
No, it's all right.
It's all right, son.

02:10.076 --> 02:14.045
Rosalie, why were you
berating Martin?

02:14.080 --> 02:16.881
He spilled coffee
all over the keyboard.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.851
And I just got a call.
Teddy's in the ER.

02:19.886 --> 02:21.252
The nurse said he fell.

02:21.287 --> 02:23.922
He's got three stitches
in his forehead.

02:23.957 --> 02:25.723
- Is he all right?
- I don't know.

02:25.759 --> 02:27.191
He's not answering his phone.

02:27.226 --> 02:29.761
I'm gonna go to Cedars
and pick him up.

02:29.796 --> 02:31.029
Is there anything I can do?

02:31.064 --> 02:34.065
No, it's all right.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.034
It's only three stitches,
Rosalie.

02:36.069 --> 02:38.636
I'm sure he's going to be fine.

02:38.672 --> 02:40.304
I don't know, Walter.

02:42.776 --> 02:45.142
I don't know.

02:45.178 --> 02:46.911
Listen, buddy, you're
not gonna get fired

02:46.947 --> 02:48.880
because you spilled
a cup of coffee.

02:48.915 --> 02:50.882
I'm not worried about that.

02:50.917 --> 02:53.651
It... it's Rosalie. I'm...
I'm worried about our friendship.

02:53.687 --> 02:55.453
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:55.488 --> 02:59.057
I'm going with Rosalie
to Cedars-Sinai to get Teddy.

02:59.092 --> 03:01.225
Nothing serious,
should be about an hour.

03:01.260 --> 03:02.994
Email me the script for A block.

03:03.029 --> 03:04.662
I'll look at it on my phone.

03:06.432 --> 03:08.132
What's that on your head?

03:08.167 --> 03:11.102
Oh, it's... it's just
my... my ostrich pillow.

03:12.939 --> 03:15.707
- What's on your face?
- Shaving cream.

03:15.742 --> 03:17.541
What did you think it was?

03:17.577 --> 03:19.376
Nothing... nothing.

03:21.615 --> 03:24.082
God damn it.

03:26.252 --> 03:29.053
Teddy checked himself out
against medical advice.

03:29.089 --> 03:30.822
He told them
he had to go to work.

03:30.857 --> 03:32.724
- He's retired.
- Of course.

03:32.759 --> 03:34.258
I think he must've gone home,

03:34.293 --> 03:36.160
but he's still not
answering his phone.

03:36.195 --> 03:38.262
I hope he hasn't
got a concussion.

03:38.297 --> 03:39.697
Let's go to your house then.

03:39.733 --> 03:41.733
Well, maybe you should
go back to the office.

03:41.768 --> 03:43.635
- You've still got a lot to do.
- No, we're in good shape.

03:43.670 --> 03:46.370
Jim and Celia can take care
of anything that comes up.

03:46.405 --> 03:47.972
Come on.

03:48.008 --> 03:50.441
Hey, the ladies are waiting for us
in the conference room.

03:50.476 --> 03:52.010
Okay.

03:52.045 --> 03:54.445
What's that thing for, anyways? Like
a pinched nerve in your neck?

03:54.480 --> 03:56.814
No, it's an ostrich pillow.

03:58.952 --> 04:01.519
Since I... I lost my nest,

04:01.554 --> 04:04.722
it's kind of a miniature
nest for me to hide in.

04:04.758 --> 04:08.559
I can relate. You know,
Rosalie's kind of like my nest.

04:08.594 --> 04:12.030
Or she was.

04:12.065 --> 04:14.899
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- Yeah.

04:14.934 --> 04:16.166
I like your top.

04:16.202 --> 04:17.500
Oh, thanks.

04:17.536 --> 04:19.103
Oh, yeah, we're matching.

04:19.139 --> 04:22.339
- Funny.
- Twinsies.

04:22.375 --> 04:24.676
But your breasts
look better than mine.

04:24.711 --> 04:26.377
What?

04:26.412 --> 04:28.212
- Don't be silly.
- It's true.

04:28.247 --> 04:29.981
I wish I had your breasts.

04:31.885 --> 04:35.119
My dad always said that
champagne-glass boobs were the sexiest,

04:35.155 --> 04:37.254
and I've never gotten
that out of my head.

04:37.290 --> 04:38.956
Did I just hear the word
"champagne-boob"?

04:38.992 --> 04:40.591
Oh, I like pointy boobs.

04:40.626 --> 04:43.795
You know, the ones that
look like magical elf shoes?

04:43.830 --> 04:45.296
Elf shoes?

04:45.331 --> 04:48.566
- You're turned on by elves?
- Oh, yeah.

04:48.601 --> 04:51.368
This is very strange.

04:51.404 --> 04:53.971
Where can he be? His car
is still in the driveway.

04:54.007 --> 04:57.008
God damn it, he's still not
answering his phone.

04:57.043 --> 04:58.710
Oh, Rosalie.

05:00.279 --> 05:01.713
Oh, well, he must've just left.

05:01.748 --> 05:03.647
Look, the ice in this drink
is not melted.

05:03.683 --> 05:05.883
Maybe he went for a walk
to clear his head.

05:05.919 --> 05:09.220
Maybe, but it's too early
for him to be drinking.

05:09.255 --> 05:10.521
Rosalie, what is going on here?

05:10.556 --> 05:13.390
Your home is never this untidy.

05:13.426 --> 05:15.659
Teddy keeps it
so neat, like Harry.

05:15.695 --> 05:18.029
I don't know what's going on.

05:18.064 --> 05:19.797
We had a fight last night.

05:19.833 --> 05:22.499
When I woke this morning,
he was gone.

05:24.370 --> 05:26.503
- Teddy?
- No, a receipt.

05:26.539 --> 05:30.007
Teddy and I have
a rideshare account.

05:30.043 --> 05:32.309
He took a car to Burbank.

05:32.345 --> 05:34.078
Oh, Burbank? Another woman.

05:34.114 --> 05:36.614
I hope so. Then he'd be safe.

05:36.649 --> 05:39.516
I'm just checking the address.

05:39.552 --> 05:41.485
It's a bar. The Britisher.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.387
They open early for alcoholics.

05:43.422 --> 05:45.589
Oh, Lord,
he's going on a bender.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.759
Well, he should've called me.

05:48.995 --> 05:51.796
Big...

05:51.831 --> 05:53.430
jug.

05:53.466 --> 05:55.432
So, what other kind
of boobs are there?

05:55.468 --> 05:57.534
Walter and Rosalie on line one.

05:57.570 --> 05:59.170
- I got it.
- Got it.

05:59.205 --> 06:01.372
- Hello, Walter. How are you?
- Hello, everyone.

06:01.407 --> 06:03.274
We'll be a bit longer
than I thought.

06:03.309 --> 06:06.410
Email us your pitches
and any tape you have

06:06.445 --> 06:07.745
so Walter can prep.

06:07.781 --> 06:11.082
And, Martin, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

06:11.117 --> 06:12.817
You didn't deserve that.

06:12.852 --> 06:15.486
It's all right. I still worship
you unconditionally.

06:15.521 --> 06:18.422
Thank you. You're a good man.

06:18.457 --> 06:20.491
Anything to add, Walter?

06:20.526 --> 06:23.261
Jim, you're in charge
until I get back.

06:23.296 --> 06:24.796
- Okay.
- What?

06:24.831 --> 06:26.397
Well, why aren't I in charge?

06:26.432 --> 06:27.965
Is it 'cause I'm a woman?

06:28.001 --> 06:30.201
- No, Jim's senior.
- Yes.

06:30.236 --> 06:31.702
If there was any gender bias,

06:31.737 --> 06:33.871
it was unconscious
and I apologize.

06:33.907 --> 06:35.706
Well, put me in charge, then.

06:35.741 --> 06:37.975
- Celia.
- I can't, Celia.

06:38.011 --> 06:40.778
It wouldn't be fair to Jim after
I just said he was in charge.

06:40.814 --> 06:42.780
- Thank you.
- May I speak to Harry?

06:42.816 --> 06:45.016
Yes, Major?

06:45.051 --> 06:46.884
Just wanted to hear
your voice, Harry.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.519
All right, good-bye, everyone.

06:48.554 --> 06:50.288
We'll be back
as soon as possible.

06:50.323 --> 06:51.622
- Bye, Walter.
- Bye.

06:51.657 --> 06:53.257
Bye, Rosalie.

06:53.293 --> 06:55.626
I'm just gonna...

06:55.661 --> 06:58.729
just scoot over here.

06:58.764 --> 07:02.834
Make it official, I guess.

07:02.869 --> 07:04.468
Anything I can do for you, sir?

07:04.503 --> 07:06.337
Something for
your coffee, perhaps?

07:06.372 --> 07:08.139
Uh, I don't, uh...

07:08.174 --> 07:10.541
no, no, thanks, Harry.

07:13.112 --> 07:16.380
So I suppose
I'm the new Rosalie.

07:16.415 --> 07:18.582
Okay.

07:20.820 --> 07:22.920
Get out. I want to be
in Celia's chair.

07:22.956 --> 07:24.421
Nope, too late.

07:24.457 --> 07:27.624
Why doesn't anyone want
to sit in the Jim chair?

07:27.660 --> 07:29.360
It feels sad over there.

07:29.395 --> 07:31.863
It's always moist.

07:31.898 --> 07:35.733
Excuse me, sir. We are looking
for a man, blonde,

07:35.768 --> 07:38.135
not much in the way
of cheekbones,

07:38.171 --> 07:40.371
tall, glasses, good posture.

07:40.406 --> 07:42.673
May have a bandage
on his forehead.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.476
- Kind of bemused look in the eye.
- Walter, that's enough.

07:45.511 --> 07:48.212
Well, I'm trying to give
an accurate description.

07:48.248 --> 07:51.548
Sir, I asked you a question.

07:51.584 --> 07:52.917
I don't answer questions.

07:52.952 --> 07:54.818
What do you mean you
don't answer questions?

07:54.854 --> 07:57.221
I mean, uh, this
is the Britisher Bar.

07:57.257 --> 07:59.223
I'm British. I have rights here.

07:59.259 --> 08:00.691
Whose drink was that?

08:00.726 --> 08:02.159
You know, you just asked
two questions,

08:02.195 --> 08:04.395
and I told you
I don't answer questions.

08:04.430 --> 08:07.198
I'd like you
to respect my boundaries.

08:07.233 --> 08:09.767
Walter, Teddy's in another car
less than a mile from here.

08:09.802 --> 08:12.036
He's on the move.
He must've just left.

08:12.071 --> 08:14.405
Yeah, thank you, sir,
for all your help.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.873
This is a fantastic
tracking device.

08:15.909 --> 08:17.942
Give me the keys. I will drive.

08:17.977 --> 08:21.145
Let's lead with the teachers'
unions protesting in Ohio.

08:21.180 --> 08:23.580
I do love a good
protest story...

08:23.616 --> 08:25.783
- ...as Walter says.
- Yeah.

08:25.818 --> 08:29.053
Oh, is that supposed to
be your Walter impersonation?

08:29.088 --> 08:34.058
I... I think we should start with the
Pentagon leaks 'cause he's always like,

08:34.092 --> 08:36.961
"I do love a good leak."

08:36.996 --> 08:38.962
No, he would want
to lead with the strike.

08:38.998 --> 08:40.932
He's pro teachers and pro union.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.832
I think Pentagon...

08:42.868 --> 08:45.269
because it's military and
I already sent it to him.

08:45.305 --> 08:46.470
What do you think, Shelly?

08:46.505 --> 08:47.771
Let's go with the strike.

08:47.807 --> 08:50.174
Celia had the better
Walter impression.

08:50.209 --> 08:51.375
Martin?

08:51.411 --> 08:53.010
Oh, I agree
with Shelly for once.

08:53.046 --> 08:54.778
Celia did have
the better impression.

08:54.814 --> 08:57.048
Yours just sounds
like Sean Connery.

08:57.083 --> 08:59.083
- Yeah, I thought that.
- Buddy, come on.

08:59.118 --> 09:00.584
She's English.

09:00.619 --> 09:02.553
Yeah, and I'm Indian.
What's your point?

09:03.990 --> 09:05.722
We're gaining on him, Walter.

09:05.758 --> 09:08.259
Oh, I'm an excellent tracker.

09:08.294 --> 09:10.227
I always get my man.

09:13.433 --> 09:16.633
Jesus Christ. Pull over, Walter!

09:16.669 --> 09:18.836
Sod it!

09:27.280 --> 09:30.814
- Damn it, Teddy's getting away.
- Oh, shit.

09:30.850 --> 09:33.384
Oh, my God, wait a minute.

09:33.419 --> 09:35.486
My license has been suspended.

09:35.521 --> 09:37.188
Rosalie, quick,
change seats with me.

09:40.759 --> 09:42.326
- Okay?
- Okay.

09:44.697 --> 09:46.097
Here, that's it.

09:48.734 --> 09:50.701
Oh, shit. Back, back, back.

09:50.736 --> 09:53.770
- What? What?
- Go back, go back, go back.

09:53.806 --> 09:56.707
- We gotta go back?
- Yes, go back.

09:56.742 --> 09:58.009
- Okay.
- Fuck.

10:00.113 --> 10:02.913
Hello, Officer.

10:02.948 --> 10:04.948
Just having a little
seat belt problem.

10:04.984 --> 10:06.517
You didn't see
that red light, sir?

10:06.552 --> 10:08.685
Yes, I did.
But you see, Officer,

10:08.721 --> 10:10.888
we are in pursuit
of my friend's husband

10:10.923 --> 10:13.324
who has suffered a head wound
and he's in a hired car.

10:13.359 --> 10:15.159
Hey, you're Walter Blunt.

10:15.194 --> 10:17.028
You kicked a member
of the LAPD in the balls...

10:17.063 --> 10:18.629
Look, I understand
your position, Officer,

10:18.664 --> 10:20.864
but your colleague is recovered

10:20.900 --> 10:23.067
and he has full use
of both testes.

10:23.102 --> 10:26.103
What I wanted to say,
Mr. Blunt...

10:26.139 --> 10:27.604
is thank you.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.073
Out here in Burbank,
we're not too fond

10:29.108 --> 10:31.642
of the Los Angeles
Pricks Department.

10:31.677 --> 10:34.678
So I'm not going
to impound you,

10:34.713 --> 10:39.083
but I am going to have to give the
lady who was driving a ticket.

10:39.118 --> 10:42.886
Thank you, Officer. A donation
will be made immediately

10:42.922 --> 10:46.057
to the Fraternal Order
of the Burbank PD.

10:47.993 --> 10:49.960
That went well.

10:49.995 --> 10:51.295
Oh, Rosalie, look.

10:51.330 --> 10:53.064
It's the zero-impact family.

10:53.099 --> 10:55.632
My God, they're riding
their bicycles to the studio.

10:55.668 --> 10:58.702
Mr. Adler!

10:58.737 --> 11:00.538
Mr. Adler!

11:02.108 --> 11:04.241
Oh, damn it. He didn't hear me.

11:05.878 --> 11:09.646
Oh, Rosalie, I have to
get back to the studio.

11:09.682 --> 11:12.749
Oh, where's he going now?

11:12.785 --> 11:14.685
Oh, Teddy.

11:14.720 --> 11:18.021
Thank you, gentlemen.

11:18.057 --> 11:21.225
A car will be here for you
in five minutes.

11:21.260 --> 11:24.061
- Where's Teddy now?
- He's hit the desert.

11:24.097 --> 11:26.630
You know, I hate that you have
to press on without me,

11:26.665 --> 11:28.031
but you understand.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.667
It's okay, Walter.
I can handle it.

11:30.703 --> 11:32.470
You're needed
back at the studio.

11:40.546 --> 11:42.813
- Rosalie, wait, wait, wait.
- No, I'm coming with you.

11:42.848 --> 11:44.315
Don't be ridiculous.

11:44.350 --> 11:47.351
You haven't missed
a broadcast in five years.

11:47.386 --> 11:49.653
And you have been
by my side for 20.

11:49.688 --> 11:53.090
- You're more important
to me than Blunt Talk. - I am?

11:53.126 --> 11:58.596
Well, I mean, it...
um, it... it's very close.

11:58.631 --> 12:00.097
Yes, you're more important.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.032
I keep saying
I have to help people.

12:02.067 --> 12:04.635
Then I should help you,
someone I love.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.275
Walter is on line one.

12:11.310 --> 12:12.743
Yes, Walter.

12:12.778 --> 12:14.578
- Listen up.
- Rosalie and I

12:14.614 --> 12:17.248
are not gonna make it back
for the broadcast tonight,

12:17.283 --> 12:20.717
so, Jim, I want you
to replace me on air.

12:20.753 --> 12:22.686
W-what? On the air?

12:22.721 --> 12:25.122
You told me that's your dream.

12:25.158 --> 12:27.858
Walter, this is now
conscious gender bias.

12:27.893 --> 12:29.760
I'd like to be on air.

12:29.795 --> 12:32.563
But you never
told me that, Celia.

12:32.598 --> 12:34.865
Uh, next time there is a crisis,
you can have my chair.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.900
I promise you that.

12:36.935 --> 12:39.236
But there is something
that you can do for me.

12:39.272 --> 12:40.737
Yes, Walter?

12:40.773 --> 12:43.974
Bump the zero-impact family.

12:44.009 --> 12:46.443
I want to have
that interview for myself.

12:46.479 --> 12:49.112
Apologize to them on my behalf.

12:49.148 --> 12:53.016
Tell Mr. Adler I will have
him on air as soon as possible.

12:53.052 --> 12:54.885
Oh, God.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.687
Uh, W-Walter, I...
I just want to say

12:56.722 --> 12:58.222
thank you for this opportunity.

12:58.257 --> 13:00.624
What's that, Jim?
I-I can't hear you.

13:00.660 --> 13:03.160
I wanted to thank you
for this opportunity.

13:03.196 --> 13:05.996
Um, but, this is
kind of overwhelming.

13:06.031 --> 13:08.399
I can't hear them. I think we've
lost the connection.

13:08.434 --> 13:10.033
- Yeah.
- Oh, Lord.

13:10.069 --> 13:12.936
I hope Jim
doesn't fail miserably.

13:12.971 --> 13:14.505
God, yes.

13:17.577 --> 13:19.310
Take this, sir.

13:25.884 --> 13:27.117
Well, if we're
gonna pull this off,

13:27.152 --> 13:28.686
we need to change your look.

13:28.721 --> 13:30.120
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

13:30.155 --> 13:31.255
What's wrong with my look?

13:31.290 --> 13:33.757
Plenty. Come with me, sir.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.659
Thanks, Harry.

13:38.764 --> 13:42.032
- Still not answering hiphone.
- What does the app say?

13:42.067 --> 13:44.167
Oh, he's just been dropped off.

13:44.203 --> 13:47.371
1100 Lonesome Canyon Road.

13:47.406 --> 13:49.373
- Oh, Lord, it's 20 miles away.
- What?

13:49.408 --> 13:51.675
Well, let's hope he stays put.

13:53.212 --> 13:57.348
Rosalie, has Teddy
been acting erratic lately?

13:57.383 --> 14:00.351
Walter, I... I'm not in the mood
for talking right now.

14:00.386 --> 14:03.254
I... I just
want to find him, okay?

14:03.289 --> 14:05.122
Yes, of course.

14:08.227 --> 14:12.963
You know, this desert
makes me think of Joshua Tree.

14:12.998 --> 14:15.932
- You remember?
- Of course.

14:15.968 --> 14:19.035
The party.

14:19.071 --> 14:21.538
- Teddy got loaded.
- Yeah.

14:21.574 --> 14:24.975
He started reciting
poetry naked.

14:26.312 --> 14:28.078
His body was
completely hairless.

14:31.550 --> 14:32.650
He was so happy.

14:32.685 --> 14:36.019
Well, those are two
things he loves...

14:36.054 --> 14:38.221
nudity and poetry.

14:38.257 --> 14:41.392
You know, when we
were starting Blunt Talk,

14:41.427 --> 14:43.994
he wrote down
a line of poetry for me.

14:44.029 --> 14:47.197
By Jack Gilbert.

14:47.232 --> 14:49.333
And I've carried it
around ever since.

14:50.417 --> 14:55.553
"I believe Icarus
was not failing as he fell,

14:55.589 --> 15:00.158
but just coming to
the end of his triumph."

15:00.193 --> 15:02.527
What does that mean?

15:02.562 --> 15:04.529
Well, that's what I asked Teddy,

15:04.564 --> 15:09.200
and he said,
"Don't be scared to fly."

15:23.951 --> 15:26.551
Oh, damn, there's no shampoo.

15:29.056 --> 15:30.188
Harry?

15:30.223 --> 15:32.290
Yes, sir.

15:32.325 --> 15:34.793
Uh, thank you.

15:36.697 --> 15:39.230
Are you sure this is really
necessary, Harry?

15:39.266 --> 15:40.866
Yes, Major.

15:40.901 --> 15:42.367
Did you just call me Major?

15:42.402 --> 15:44.335
Yes, Major...
I mean, sir.

15:44.371 --> 15:45.937
Sorry, sir. Force of habit.

15:45.973 --> 15:48.206
It's okay, just...
you can call me Jim

15:48.241 --> 15:49.507
like you used to, you know?

15:49.543 --> 15:52.644
With your change in status,
I prefer sir, sir.

15:52.680 --> 15:56.548
So, let's start the whipping.

15:56.583 --> 15:59.718
Would you like dialogue?

16:02.422 --> 16:03.922
Okay.

16:05.458 --> 16:06.992
You've been unclean, sir!

16:08.295 --> 16:10.662
Very unclean!

16:10.698 --> 16:12.998
Naughty!

16:13.033 --> 16:14.866
Naughty!

16:14.902 --> 16:15.967
What are you?

16:16.003 --> 16:17.102
I'm messy...

16:17.137 --> 16:18.469
You are messy!

16:18.505 --> 16:21.272
- Right, tidy your room!
- Tidy my room!

16:21.308 --> 16:22.741
Tidy your room!

16:22.776 --> 16:24.242
Tidy your room!

16:24.277 --> 16:27.746
Walter wanted me to convey
his most sincere apologies

16:27.781 --> 16:30.048
for bumping you
off the show again.

16:30.084 --> 16:32.751
I'm sorry,
I can't keep pretending

16:32.786 --> 16:35.187
that someone is not
howling in pain nearby.

16:35.222 --> 16:38.790
Oh, that. Oh, that's my, um...
my fellow senior producer

16:38.826 --> 16:40.726
is getting ready
for his broadcast debut.

16:40.761 --> 16:42.260
He's subbing for Walter.

16:42.295 --> 16:43.995
But why is he in agony?

16:44.031 --> 16:46.098
Well, um, Harry,
Walter's manservant,

16:46.133 --> 16:49.267
is leeching his body of toxins
by whipping him with a towel.

16:49.302 --> 16:51.203
That's my understanding.

16:51.238 --> 16:53.338
Well, we need to leech
our planet of toxins,

16:53.373 --> 16:56.742
which is why it's so crucial that
my family and I be on the show.

16:56.777 --> 16:58.309
I'm so sorry, as is Walter.

16:58.345 --> 17:01.012
But you will be on the
show again, I promise.

17:01.048 --> 17:03.148
Okay. Thank you.

17:03.183 --> 17:06.416
I'm not good at being assertive.
I have odd self-esteem.

17:06.453 --> 17:09.420
But it's very important
that I stress

17:09.455 --> 17:13.724
we need to get our message
out there to the people.

17:13.761 --> 17:15.926
Mankind is imbalanced
and needs to change.

17:17.664 --> 17:19.131
Oh, God! Oh, God!

17:19.165 --> 17:21.800
Walter has a manservant.

17:21.835 --> 17:24.335
Yes. Yes, he does.

17:36.069 --> 17:38.760
VACANCY
POOL - AIR CONDITIONED

17:46.794 --> 17:49.661
Well, there's no more
activity on the app,

17:49.696 --> 17:52.230
so he has to be here.

17:52.266 --> 17:55.733
God, what a desolate,
dreary place.

17:55.769 --> 17:57.269
Come on, Walter.

18:02.176 --> 18:04.276
Are you sure you don't want me
to shave your head, sir,

18:04.311 --> 18:05.844
so you can look like the major?

18:05.879 --> 18:08.746
It wouldn't take
much time at all.

18:08.782 --> 18:10.348
No, I'd like to keep
my hair, Harry.

18:10.383 --> 18:13.018
I really would.

18:13.053 --> 18:16.221
It's like a curtain for my head.

18:16.256 --> 18:18.656
I think a bald head
would suit you, sir,

18:18.692 --> 18:20.458
just as it does the major.

18:20.493 --> 18:22.260
But I defer to your wishes.

18:23.563 --> 18:25.563
Unhappily, I may add.

18:27.301 --> 18:29.201
Now, hold still, sir.
Deep breaths.

18:32.605 --> 18:33.872
No flinching.

18:35.142 --> 18:37.375
I don't feel comfortable
doing this.

18:37.410 --> 18:40.478
Our guests come here
for privacy and relaxation.

18:40.513 --> 18:43.715
Or for smoking meth,
but I'm cracking down on that.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.151
Your husband's
not a meth-head, is he?

18:46.186 --> 18:48.153
No, nothing stronger than booze.

18:48.188 --> 18:50.889
Meth? Thankfully, that's
one drug I've never tried.

18:50.924 --> 18:52.790
I hear it's very bad
for the teeth.

18:52.826 --> 18:56.261
Well, meth or no meth,
you gotta floss.

18:58.265 --> 18:59.998
Hello?

19:02.069 --> 19:05.237
- Hello?!
- Teddy, open the door, darling!

19:06.473 --> 19:08.273
Okay.

19:13.780 --> 19:16.214
Jesus, we're on
a wild-goose chase.

19:16.250 --> 19:20.451
He's not in the bathroom,
but he used it.

19:20.487 --> 19:22.320
And he didn't flush.

19:22.356 --> 19:24.356
That's not like Teddy.

19:24.391 --> 19:26.624
Actually, it is.

19:30.030 --> 19:32.063
May I present tonight's host

19:32.099 --> 19:34.966
of Blunt Talk, Mr. James Stone?

19:42.809 --> 19:44.976
Stop it, no.

19:45.012 --> 19:46.544
Okay. It's okay.

19:46.579 --> 19:48.079
- Turn around!
- Spin, yeah.

19:48.115 --> 19:50.648
- Really?
- Spin! Spin!

20:01.194 --> 20:03.628
More, more!

20:07.567 --> 20:09.267
Impressive moves, Jim.

20:09.303 --> 20:11.369
How about we save some of
that for the broadcast?

20:11.405 --> 20:14.472
Rosalie called and told me
about Walter's laryngitis.

20:16.509 --> 20:18.176
So I'm counting on you.

20:18.211 --> 20:22.147
This is your Super Bowl,
your Broadway debut.

20:22.182 --> 20:27.552
This is you coming out
of the birth canal.

20:27.587 --> 20:29.687
- I will.
- He's gonna be great.

20:29.722 --> 20:31.589
I mean, he's gonna... he's gonna
lead with Pentagon leaks...

20:31.624 --> 20:33.658
Yeah, but what I'm looking
for here is charisma,

20:33.693 --> 20:36.127
humanity, enunciation.

20:36.163 --> 20:38.563
- A-a masculine vibe.
- Yeah.

20:38.598 --> 20:40.731
And numbers.

20:40.767 --> 20:42.167
Really good numbers.

20:47.107 --> 20:49.107
Don't fuck up.

20:49.142 --> 20:50.608
I won't.

20:52.079 --> 20:53.811
No fear!

20:59.052 --> 21:01.052
I can't do this.

21:01.088 --> 21:03.088
- I can't do this.
- No, don't be ridiculous, Jim.

21:03.123 --> 21:05.056
You're just gonna read
off the teleprompter

21:05.092 --> 21:06.924
- and sit up straight.
- Right.

21:06.960 --> 21:07.892
- Yep.
- Okay. Okay.

21:07.927 --> 21:09.494
- That easy.
- Good.

21:12.065 --> 21:13.999
No, I'm sorry.

21:21.441 --> 21:22.773
Teddy?

21:22.809 --> 21:24.376
Teddy!

21:26.679 --> 21:29.947
The sun'll be gone soon and
he doesn't have his windbreaker.

21:29.983 --> 21:31.883
- Where is he, Walter?
- I don't know.

21:31.918 --> 21:33.684
- Teddy!
- Rosalie.

21:33.720 --> 21:37.822
- Teddy! - Rosalie, this is madness.
Look, he could be anywhere.

21:37.857 --> 21:39.190
We need to call the police.

21:39.226 --> 21:41.159
- No, we'll find him.
- Rosalie...

21:41.194 --> 21:43.194
- Teddy!
- Rosalie, stop it.

21:43.230 --> 21:45.363
Stop it.

21:45.399 --> 21:49.167
Y-you have to face up
to what's going on.

21:49.202 --> 21:50.635
What do you mean?

21:50.670 --> 21:53.505
All right, I'm gonna
say this straight out.

21:53.540 --> 21:56.441
Is Teddy showing
signs of dementia?

21:56.476 --> 21:59.444
No, please don't say
that word, Walter.

21:59.479 --> 22:04.015
- Rosalie...
- I don't want to watch Teddy...

22:04.051 --> 22:07.018
disappear in front of my eyes

22:07.054 --> 22:09.654
like my mother did

22:09.689 --> 22:11.889
till he's a stranger.

22:11.925 --> 22:14.725
- Rosalie...
- I'm not ready to lose him.

22:14.761 --> 22:18.596
I don't want to say good-bye.

22:27.174 --> 22:30.741
Right, now you two
get down there and spoon.

22:30.777 --> 22:34.345
That's what the major
and Rosalie do in a crisis.

22:42.322 --> 22:45.957
No, Celia is the big spoon,

22:45.992 --> 22:47.725
Jim is the little spoon.

22:56.536 --> 22:58.436
That's better.

23:08.014 --> 23:10.081
I'm not ready for this.

23:13.153 --> 23:14.685
Listen, Jim...

23:14.721 --> 23:19.056
I was hurt when Walter
chose you over me.

23:19.092 --> 23:21.159
But when you came out
of here before,

23:21.194 --> 23:25.062
I didn't see a guy
in hoarding recovery,

23:25.098 --> 23:29.400
I saw a very handsome,
capable news-man.

23:29.436 --> 23:32.570
You did?

23:32.606 --> 23:34.272
Yeah, I did.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.479
I like spooning.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.723
Is that...?

24:03.002 --> 24:04.802
Teddy!

24:06.506 --> 24:09.274
Teddy, what are you doing?

24:13.380 --> 24:16.648
Sweetheart, what are you
doing in the pool?

24:16.683 --> 24:18.883
It was hot.

24:18.918 --> 24:23.754
But why have you come
all the way out here to this motel?

24:25.425 --> 24:27.258
I needed to lie down.

24:35.502 --> 24:37.569
Okay, Jim, we're going live

24:37.604 --> 24:42.640
in five, four, three, two...

24:44.377 --> 24:46.411
Good evening. I'm James Stone

24:46.446 --> 24:48.779
filling in for Walter Blunt.

24:50.483 --> 24:55.119
Tonight, anonymous leaks
from inside the Pentagon

24:55.154 --> 24:58.022
send shock waves
through Washington.

24:58.057 --> 24:59.890
Are there more on the horizon?

24:59.926 --> 25:01.259
It's not good.

25:01.294 --> 25:02.793
His eyebrows
are losing their mind.

25:05.432 --> 25:08.666
The leaks included
internal emails

25:08.702 --> 25:11.502
detailing the CIA cyber-attack.

25:11.538 --> 25:13.538
Jim, just calm down.

25:13.573 --> 25:15.273
Remember the spooning.

25:15.308 --> 25:17.007
I'm rooting for you.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.881
The emails detailed
a CIA cyber-attack

25:23.916 --> 25:26.984
designed to disable
Iranian centrifuges.

25:27.019 --> 25:31.122
This ended up blacking out a significant
portion of southern Turkey.

25:31.157 --> 25:34.992
Officials in Ankara submitted
a formal complaint to the UN.

25:35.027 --> 25:39.163
This comes on the heels of allegations
regarding the use of US drones...

25:41.834 --> 25:43.901
- Well done, sir.
- Thank you, Harry.

25:47.641 --> 25:50.375
You know, we made pretty good
Walter and Rosalies.

25:50.410 --> 25:53.478
No, we make excellent
Jim and Celias.

26:11.498 --> 26:15.199
Can we just rest here for a while?

26:17.036 --> 26:18.803
Of course.
