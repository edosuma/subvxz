WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:04.172
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 All right, let's go!
 As you know, Jane and Michael

00:04.205 --> 00:06.640
were about to get married.
 And the wedding

00:06.674 --> 00:09.243
was going to be in
 Jane's house. Only, it flooded!

00:09.277 --> 00:11.312
So Rogelio rebuilt their house
 on the soundstage

00:11.345 --> 00:13.581
of his telenovela.
 What a dad, right?

00:13.614 --> 00:15.249
Unfortunately, things
 weren't as hunky-dory

00:15.283 --> 00:17.118
for Jane and Petra.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.187
See, Petra's twin
 Anezka showed up and started

00:19.220 --> 00:22.156
causing trouble for Jane. And
 Petra lied to protect her...

00:22.190 --> 00:24.392
My sister said she didn't
place that ad and I believe her.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.693
...leaving Jane reeling.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.395
You don't have to lie for me
anymore, Petra.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.197
I have nothing to say to you.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.332
Oh, and speaking of shady
 relatives, Rafael's mom

00:31.365 --> 00:33.534
was the crime lord
 known as Mutter.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.669
Oh, and his long-lost brother
 Derek showed up

00:35.703 --> 00:38.672
and tricked Rafael into making
 money off an insider trade.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.808
And now he was blackmailing him

00:40.841 --> 00:42.476
for control
 of the hotel next door.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.412
You sell me the Fairwick
for a dollar

00:44.445 --> 00:46.314
or I turn you in to the feds
for insider trading.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.816
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I know! Cray-cray, right?

00:48.849 --> 00:51.285
Anyway, Jane told Michael,
 and Michael wanted to help,

00:51.319 --> 00:53.721
only he'd lost
 his detective job.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.157
So he reached out
 to his old partner, Susanna.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.459
Derek Ruvelle is totally dirty,
and I've got proof.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.761
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And Michael was right!
 Because this happened.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.763
We'll have the Fairwick
by the end of the week.

01:02.796 --> 01:03.864
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which, friends,

01:03.897 --> 01:06.534
is where we left off.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.702
Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:08.736 --> 01:12.540
would never forget the moment
 she first saw him.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.676
The man who was destined
 to become

01:15.709 --> 01:19.447
her son's favorite
 children's party entertainer.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.482
This guy is amazing.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.784
I know.
Bobby's the best.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.353
What's his last name?
We were thinking about

01:25.386 --> 01:26.820
booking him
for Mateo's birthday.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.323
No last name.
He's like Beyoncé.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.525
Well, how do you get in touch
with him? Bella's obsessed, too.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.195
Talk to him here. Bobby
books out months in advance.

01:34.228 --> 01:37.165
When are Mateo and
Bella's birthdays?

01:37.198 --> 01:38.499
May 14.
May 14.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.571
Oh... so, were you thinking
about booking him?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.906
Nah. I... I'm actually

01:45.939 --> 01:48.509
thinking a magician
or a clown might be better.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.378
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It should be noted that Jane
 believed in fighting fair.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.313
Oh! Oh, hell, no.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.382
Jane, go!
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 But she also believed

01:54.415 --> 01:56.184
in fighting back.
Hey, Vanessa, is that
Brandi going towards

01:56.217 --> 01:57.485
the parking lot?
Oopsies!

01:57.518 --> 01:58.619
Bobby, big fan of your work.

01:58.652 --> 01:59.653
I'd like
to reserve your services

01:59.687 --> 02:01.155
for Saturday, May 14, and I can

02:01.189 --> 02:02.856
pay you the deposit
today. Thank you.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.358
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Can you blame her? A kid's

02:04.392 --> 02:05.859
first birthday
 is a pretty big deal.

02:05.893 --> 02:09.597
Which brings us here, now.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.663
Okay, Abuela, you're on
balloons. Mom, food.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.333
I got his outfit,
Michael,

02:12.366 --> 02:13.634
you're assembling
party favors, and

02:13.667 --> 02:15.236
remember to...
Put it in Mateo's

02:15.269 --> 02:17.271
birthday pile and not
the wedding pile.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.639
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, right. Jane has two

02:18.672 --> 02:20.241
big parties coming up.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.375
Right, Mom, wedding--

02:21.409 --> 02:22.776
I need you to update the RSVPs.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.678
Michael, did you
make sure that your groomsmen

02:24.712 --> 02:25.879
have suits?
I did.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.648
They do.
Okay. Good.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.250
I feel good.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, dear.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.551
Waiting for that ball to drop.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.919
(phone buzzes)
Oh, shoot.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.521
E-mail from Professor Donaldson.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.822
Feedback for my novella.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.590
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Here we go.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.660
She likes it.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.894
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 What?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.630
She says, and I quote,
"Really good.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.932
"This is approved
to develop into your thesis

02:44.965 --> 02:48.402
next year. Will discuss a few
last-minute tweaks in person."

02:56.677 --> 02:57.945
Oh, really?

03:00.881 --> 03:03.551
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 If Jane seems less than
 enthusiastic, it's because

03:03.584 --> 03:05.353
this is not the first time Alba
 has offered to introduce her

03:05.386 --> 03:08.389
to someone who
 "works in publishing."

03:08.422 --> 03:10.258
So, y-you work in publishing?

03:10.291 --> 03:13.227
Kind of. I work
at Barnes & Noble.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.996
Your grandmother says
that you're very talented.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.598
If you ever
get something published,

03:17.631 --> 03:19.433
I will put it right up front.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.903
Your grandmother
says you're very talented.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.373
If you ever make it out
to Belfast, I do hope

03:25.406 --> 03:27.775
you'll stop by the library
to pay me a visit.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.811
Your granny said...
I'm really talented,

03:30.844 --> 03:32.913
yeah, I know. And you're
an award-winning author?

03:32.946 --> 03:35.849
Yuppers. My Full House
fan fiction was voted top ten

03:35.883 --> 03:36.950
in the '90s Sitcom
category.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.252
And now everything I wrote

03:38.286 --> 03:39.353
has come true.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.826
Beverly Flores, Vice President.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.995
Simon & Schuster?

03:48.028 --> 03:51.332
Abuela, are you kidding me?
She works in publishing?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.435
And she said that
she'd read my material?

03:54.468 --> 03:56.270
Oh, my God. I can't
believe this.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.871
Do you have any idea
what this means?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.775
(squeals, laughs)

04:11.485 --> 04:13.020
I hate to break up the
celebration, but I got to go.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.622
I got the thing.
JANE: Right.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.956
Okay. Thank you, thank you.
Good luck. (kisses)

04:15.989 --> 04:17.491
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 What thing?

04:17.524 --> 04:19.026
Good luck with what?
 Oh, come on.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.628
Jane? Did you
see this?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.963
From Petra?

04:22.996 --> 04:25.566
What?

04:25.599 --> 04:26.834
You're not coming to my wedding?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.035
Of course not.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.036
Are you serious?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.471
We're in a fight.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.639
Exactly.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.341
When two people are in a fight

04:33.374 --> 04:35.008
and one person is so clearly
wrong, like you are,

04:35.042 --> 04:37.845
the person who is so clearly
wrong apologizes.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.913
I'm sorry.
Profusely.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.616
Really, really sorry.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.651
I am.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.686
Honestly.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.361
Why did you lie to me
about your sister?

04:54.895 --> 04:58.332
With the whole Mother's Day
thing, I was feeling...

04:58.366 --> 05:00.067
a little inadequate
compared to you.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.302
And, uh...

05:03.837 --> 05:06.340
I just didn't want you
to be right all the time.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.841
It's not a competition.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.877
Sometimes it can feel like one.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.613
I get that.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.548
Okay.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.717
Now is the moment that you ask
if there's anything

05:16.750 --> 05:19.119
that you can do
to make things better.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.622
Yes, yes.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.457
What can I do
to make it better?

05:23.491 --> 05:25.559
You can keep your sister
away from me.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.696
Maybe I could transfer her

05:28.729 --> 05:30.564
out of the restaurant
to housekeeping?

05:30.598 --> 05:32.733
Good idea.

05:32.766 --> 05:36.504
Now, I'd like you to reconsider
coming to my wedding.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.006
Because you're my son's
half-sisters' mother,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.841
which makes us family.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.110
And family shows up.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.613
MICHAEL:
 It's a family operation,
 it has to be.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.581
Derek is working for his mother.

05:47.615 --> 05:50.117
He was never on that boat
when he said he was, I know it.

05:50.150 --> 05:54.888
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm.
 Haven't seen her in a while.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.924
I'm not on the force.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.993
I can't get a warrant,
but you can.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.463
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh. Maybe this is what Jane
 was wishing him luck with.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.498
We need his cell phone
records, e-mails.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.600
Michael.
I...

06:06.634 --> 06:09.002
I took a leave of absence
to get away from this case.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.472
What happened the night
Sin Rostro died--

06:11.505 --> 06:12.873
it was traumatic.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.675
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah. No kidding.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.944
(grunting)

06:16.977 --> 06:18.612
(gunshot)

06:18.646 --> 06:20.848
I know. But believe
me, I wouldn't

06:20.881 --> 06:23.651
be asking if there was
another way.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.919
I'll think about it.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.555
DEREK: You've thought
 about it long enough.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.458
Time's up.
I want my hotel.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.060
Unless you prefer jail?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.728
No.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.497
Good choice.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.031
But I can't just hand over

06:38.065 --> 06:39.700
a multimillion dollar property.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.435
Okay? There's paperwork,

06:41.469 --> 06:44.037
and I need a story
to tell my accountants.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.607
You have 48 hours.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.846
(ticking)

06:56.584 --> 06:57.751
(knocking)

06:57.785 --> 06:58.986
Come in.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.156
Hey!

07:03.190 --> 07:06.059
How's my almost-
birthday boy?

07:06.093 --> 07:09.497
(kisses)
He's good, he's fighting
a little cold.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.899
Hey, anything left on your list
for the party?
Nope.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.768
All set.
And you-- how are you?

07:14.802 --> 07:17.538
Did you, uh, decide what
you're gonna do about the...

07:17.571 --> 07:19.072
(whispers):
Derek thing?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.542
Um, not yet.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.079
Look... I talked
to Michael about it.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.115
He wants to help,
and he said that

07:28.148 --> 07:30.050
Derek is the one
the police want.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.985
PETRA: It's much more
complicated than that.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.656
You don't think that
he should turn himself in?

07:35.689 --> 07:37.958
He got the money illegally,
he used that money.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.827
Yeah, and he'll
get a great lawyer.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.229
And he could still wind up
in jail. Look, I have a plan.

07:42.262 --> 07:45.232
A plan? Are you serious?
This is Rafael's future.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.602
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I'll point out now that
 this isn't a competition.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.872
I'm gonna talk to my lawyer

07:51.905 --> 07:53.006
and see what
my options are.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.008
I think
that's a great idea.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.110
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And I'll also point out

07:57.144 --> 07:58.612
Jane won.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.013
Yet again.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.282
MARLENE:
 So you're on the right track.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.817
Oh.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.118
I've got just a few small notes,

08:05.152 --> 08:06.820
then you're good to go.
Great.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.757
Because a pretty big opportunity
just fell in my lap.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.725
Yeah?
A VP at
Simon & Schuster

08:11.759 --> 08:13.260
agreed to read my work.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.228
What?
(giggles)

08:15.262 --> 08:16.864
You can't submit this
to a publisher.

08:16.897 --> 08:20.033
But you just said
it was in great shape.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.303
For a graduate thesis,
not for a publisher.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.839
You only get one shot
with someone like that.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.941
I just really don't think
you should use it

08:27.975 --> 08:29.943
when the work isn't ready.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.613
ROGELIO:
 Ready to go to work?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.948
Welcome, production
personnel, to this

08:34.982 --> 08:37.317
very special production meeting.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.086
With Dina away, I am thrilled

08:39.119 --> 08:41.688
to be your leader today.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.958
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Hmm. Guess they don't applaud
 at production meetings.

08:44.992 --> 08:48.762
All right, now, to the first
order of business--

08:48.796 --> 08:51.565
the Telemasivo Sexiest
Telenovela Star Alive

08:51.599 --> 08:53.867
Twitter poll.
You should all have

08:53.901 --> 08:55.636
voting guides.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.671
Vote early and as
often as you'd like.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.339
With your unwavering support

08:59.372 --> 09:00.941
I will vanquish Esteban

09:00.974 --> 09:03.043
for the second year in a row.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.114
Okay, moving on.
(clears throat)
Um, the, uh,

09:07.147 --> 09:09.883
crew and I have a matter
that we'd like to address.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.785
Of course, anything you need.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.887
I am here to lead.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.923
Our days are too long
and our pay is too low.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.991
Oh, you're gonna have to ask
someone else about that.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.894
I don't...
We want to unionize, but
the network refused, so...

09:20.928 --> 09:23.931
we plan to strike.
Strike?

09:23.964 --> 09:26.634
But Tiago
is a big happy family.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.102
Where does these radical
notions come from?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.691
BOTH:
 Sí, se puede,

09:50.724 --> 09:52.192
sí, se puede.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.962
ALL:
 Sí, se puede,
 sí, se puede!

09:54.995 --> 09:56.363
Picket lines go up next Friday.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.799
What? No.
Not next Friday.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.067
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 What's next Friday?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.835
JANE: Ma,

10:01.869 --> 10:04.037
I know Professor Donaldson
hates me, but this didn't

10:04.071 --> 10:06.373
feel personal.
(distant talking)

10:06.406 --> 10:08.976
Oh, let me call you back,
I'm at the studio.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.244
Dad wants to walk me
through the wedding layout.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.047
(indistinct conversations)
Dad, what's going on?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.717
This is madness.
The crew's going to strike.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.852
They want to join a union.
They're not in a union?

10:18.886 --> 10:21.789
That's terrible,
with the crazy hours they work?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.924
I know, but...
Dad, tell me that you
are supporting them.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.359
This is important. I
mean, fair is fair.
Exactly.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.928
Thank you, Jane.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.262
Did everyone hear that?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.665
Jane is on our side.
Uh, fair is fair.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.067
ALL (chanting):
Fair is fair!

10:34.101 --> 10:35.736
You don't understand!
(chanting continues)

10:35.769 --> 10:38.271
The picket lines go up Friday.
 Next Friday.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.874
As in the day before
my wedding?
Yes!

10:40.908 --> 10:42.275
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 No!

10:42.309 --> 10:44.144
Oh, we can't cross a picket line
for my wedding!

10:44.177 --> 10:46.379
Strike! Strike! Strike!
Your wedding is ruined.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.948
Ruined! Ruined! Ruined!

10:53.153 --> 10:54.888
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Hmm, I'm not sure
 who's freaking out more--

10:54.922 --> 10:55.889
Jane or Rogelio.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.758
I'm having chest pains!

10:57.791 --> 10:59.292
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Just kidding. It's Rogelio.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.895
I know, Dad. I know!

11:01.929 --> 11:04.464
Okay, I'll have to come up
with a contingency plan.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.133
Agreed.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.336
I will plant drugs on Jerry
and have him arrested!

11:09.369 --> 11:11.805
Stop. They have a valid cause.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.074
So you need to approach them
with compassion.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.210
Oh, I see. So you want me
to go full Ro-Cho.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.080
Well... full Ro-Cho.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.817
And maybe also find a way
to address their concerns

11:23.851 --> 11:25.352
so that they don't
have to strike.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.955
And in case
that doesn't work, I'll try

11:27.988 --> 11:29.823
to figure something out
for the wedding.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.391
Maybe a new venue?

11:31.424 --> 11:34.094
No, but you really wanted
to get married in your house,

11:34.127 --> 11:36.864
and I worked so hard
building that set.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.733
The crew worked so hard
building that set.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.369
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Hence the need for a strike.

11:42.402 --> 11:46.106
So maybe we move the wedding?
Until after the strike?
That could take months.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.507
No, no, I'm not pushing.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.009
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Thank God.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.377
I'd rather move it sooner.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.981
Maybe next week
before they vote, so, Thursday.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.850
As a last resort?
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of huge bummers...

11:56.884 --> 11:59.853
So, my lawyer said
they could go easy on me,

11:59.887 --> 12:03.757
or they could want to make an
example out of someone like me.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.894
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Rich, entitled,
 son of a crime lord.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.862
That's exactly
what I'm worried about.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.199
Look, I want to believe that
everything will work out okay

12:12.232 --> 12:15.068
if you're a good person and
you click your heels and wish

12:15.102 --> 12:18.438
on a star, but unfortunately, I
just don't think that's true.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.540
And neither does Jane.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.976
Please, just
hear my idea.

12:23.010 --> 12:28.115
Raf, you know I have no ulterior
motive except that I love you.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.951
As the father of my children.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.086
As my family.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.957
Krishna, hold my calls, please.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.892
JANE:
 Ma,

12:38.926 --> 12:40.828
any luck with the dress?
I'm still on hold.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.798
Tuesday. They can do
a fitting on Tuesday.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.801
Okay, hold it, and, Abuela,
keep Thursday at 5:00 for Mass.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.269
Okay, Lina's good to go,

12:49.302 --> 12:50.838
and she's telling our
friends to be prepared.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.105
I left messages
for both my parents,

12:52.139 --> 12:53.807
just got off the phone
with the tailor.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.475
If I'm there in 20 minutes,
they can fit me today.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.845
So what are you still doing
standing there?! Go! Go! Go! Go!

12:57.878 --> 12:59.847
Wait! Is my phone done charging?

12:59.880 --> 13:03.450
Yes, and you got a bunch
of missed calls.
Oh.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.318
Mwah.
Mwah.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.888
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
The Bobby? Beyoncé Bobby?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.356
Jane! It's Bobby.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.058
Listen, bit of a snafu here.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.425
I double-booked for Saturday.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.595
Call me ASAP
to confirm Mateo's party.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.164
Oh. no. Oh, no.
(phone chimes)

13:17.197 --> 13:19.332
Bobby again.
Still waiting to hear from you.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.834
Ugh!
(phone chimes)

13:20.868 --> 13:22.335
Listen,
the other person called back,

13:22.369 --> 13:24.938
and I haven't heard from you,
so... I have to cancel.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.606
No! Ugh!

13:26.639 --> 13:29.042
ROGELIO:
 I am confident
 we can find a solution.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.544
And I hope you love
the gift basket.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.485
You really thought

13:38.518 --> 13:40.854
a gift basket would make me
abandon my principles?

13:40.888 --> 13:43.924
Of course... not?

13:43.957 --> 13:45.392
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 He definitely did.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.394
It's a gesture
of solidarity.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.262
Oh, yeah?
So there's a raise

13:49.296 --> 13:50.964
and humane hours
under the beef jerky?

13:50.998 --> 13:52.332
Oh, come on, Jerry.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.101
I called the head
honchos and left word.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.502
Please don't strike.
It'll be disastrous

13:55.535 --> 13:57.137
for everyone involved
with the show.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.239
That's what
you're worried about?

13:59.272 --> 14:02.609
Of course?
Has nothing to do
with the fact that we just built

14:02.642 --> 14:04.577
a set for Jane's wedding,
and it's next week?

14:04.611 --> 14:07.981
Okay, fine! Yes, but
it's not only for Jane.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.150
Anyone's daughter can
use it, even yours!

14:10.183 --> 14:13.486
My oldest daughter is
15 years old, Rogelio.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.455
Look, it's not about that.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.125
You have no clue what this crew
goes through every day.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.060
Then clue me in.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.195
Let me walk in your shoes!

14:22.229 --> 14:23.563
What?

14:23.596 --> 14:26.433
I will join your
crew for the week.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.635
(laughs)
You wouldn't last a day.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.437
Would you care
to wager on that?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.372
What do you have in mind?

14:32.405 --> 14:34.541
If I last the week
as a crew member,

14:34.574 --> 14:37.945
you will postpone the strike
until after Jane's wedding.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.981
Okay. If you don't,

14:41.014 --> 14:44.985
you become the public face
of our strike. Deal?

14:45.018 --> 14:46.586
De...

14:46.619 --> 14:50.290
...ear God,
the calluses!

14:50.323 --> 14:54.227
Can I recommend a paraffin
treatment, which...?

14:54.261 --> 14:57.264
Sorry. I mean... deal.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.272
(clown laughing, Mateo crying)
Oh. Sweetie.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.708
I know. I know.
He's creepy.
(clown horns honk)

15:08.741 --> 15:11.711
Oh. This is a disaster.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.246
I ruined Mateo's
birthday because

15:13.280 --> 15:15.382
I was consumed by
my wedding, and now

15:15.415 --> 15:17.050
the only entertainers
available are...

15:17.084 --> 15:18.418
(quietly):
terrifying clowns
or porny clowns!

15:18.451 --> 15:21.588
What am I gonna do?!

15:21.621 --> 15:24.657
What?!

15:24.691 --> 15:27.160
No. It's his
first birthday.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.364
Abuela, stop. He deserves
a birthday party.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.202
He's having one, end of story.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.603
XIOMARA:
Okay, good news.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.405
The Din-o-mites
are available Saturday.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.340
Yes!
And they're apparently
performing at Flamingo Park

15:40.373 --> 15:43.043
tomorrow if you and Mateo want
to go check them out.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.045
Oh, no need.
Mateo's already seen them

15:45.078 --> 15:47.147
at his friend Ava's birthday.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.149
Book 'em. We're in.
Let me update Rafael.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.584
Sorry, he's been in a
closed-door meeting with Petra

15:51.618 --> 15:53.353
forever.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.189
With Petra?
An-Any idea what it's about?

15:56.223 --> 15:57.490
Nope. Closed door, so...

15:57.524 --> 15:58.758
Right. Okay.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.760
Thanks, Krishna.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.630
Can you watch Mateo?
I'll be right back. Mm.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.098
Wait. What's going on?
Where are you going?

16:05.132 --> 16:06.233
To make sure Petra doesn't

16:06.266 --> 16:07.234
corrupt Rafael's soul.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.537
Huh.
Jane. What a surprise.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.372
Well, I suppose you have a good
reason for barging in here.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.374
After a run, apparently.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.377
Birthday party crisis.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.711
Bobby canceled.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.247
Beyoncé Bobby?

16:20.280 --> 16:21.581
Oh, no. Do we have a backup?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.516
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.518
My mom found this other group,
the Din-o-mites.
PETRA: Doesn't sound like

16:25.552 --> 16:26.786
much of a crisis, then, right?

16:26.819 --> 16:29.122
Certainly not
a valid reason to disrupt

16:29.156 --> 16:30.423
a closed-door meeting. (laughs)

16:30.457 --> 16:32.659
No, but I did want to ask Rafael

16:32.692 --> 16:34.694
if he wanted to join Mateo
and me

16:34.727 --> 16:36.463
to see the Din-o-mites tomorrow.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.465
You know, just so that he
got comfortable with them

16:38.498 --> 16:41.568
and, uh... and didn't freak out
at the party.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.171
RAFAEL:
Yeah.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.173
Yeah, sure, I'll-I'll be there.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.042
That's it, then?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.277
No more urgent
birthday party business?

16:50.310 --> 16:53.046
No, that's it.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.816
Tomorrow.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.186
It's fine,
 I'll talk to him tomorrow.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.821
Petra won't be there
to lure him to the dark side.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.423
Use the force, Jane.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.125
Exactly, I will!

17:05.157 --> 17:07.594
And I'm going to convince him

17:07.627 --> 17:09.561
to turn himself in
and work with the police.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.364
Good. That's what
he should do.
Agreed.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.566
He won't have to go
to jail, right?

17:13.599 --> 17:16.069
Positioning himself as someone
who can help find a connection

17:16.103 --> 17:18.238
between Derek and
Mutter is his best bet.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.272
Even though the blackmail's not
necessarily connected to her?

17:20.307 --> 17:21.574
But it is, it has to be.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.210
It just doesn't make sense.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.811
Why would Derek blackmail
Rafael for a hotel?

17:25.845 --> 17:28.815
Instead of for cash.
Yeah, that is weird.
Exactly.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.084
Hey, does this make me,
like, your new partner?

17:31.118 --> 17:32.552
(laughs)

17:32.585 --> 17:34.087
Yeah, something like that.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.622
(both laugh, ringtone plays)

17:35.655 --> 17:37.257
Oh.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.858
Susanna.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.860
Oh, take it. Tell her
I've been covering for her,

17:40.893 --> 17:42.429
so it's all good.
Okay.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.796
SUSANNA:
 Okay.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.232
MICHAEL:
You're gonna help me?

17:45.265 --> 17:46.466
I want Mutter caught, too.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.135
So I got the case files.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.736
Tech decoded that flash drive

17:49.769 --> 17:51.504
with the criminals
whose faces were changed

17:51.538 --> 17:52.839
by Mutter and Sin Rostro,

17:52.872 --> 17:55.108
all 200 of 'em.
MICHAEL:
Great.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.310
That's... that's great.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.212
Yeah,
and at a million bucks a pop.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.747
That's $200 million
unaccounted for.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.715
I'll send you the names.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.784
Look for any connection
to Derek.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.588
(footfalls approaching)

18:08.621 --> 18:11.624
Jane? Oh, that face.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.593
You are even more
adorable in person.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.528
Wait. Do we...?
Oh, sorry, sorry.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.865
Your grandmother showed me so
many pictures. Beverly Flores.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.900
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Simon & Schuster
 Beverly Flores?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.203
Yes! Yes. Hi.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.504
Hi.
Hi.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.373
Such a pleasure to meet you.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.807
And you.
Oh.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.676
Honestly, I don't
read new writers,

18:29.709 --> 18:32.212
but your abuela
is such a hoot.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.281
She promised to pray for me
every night if I read your work.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.648
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 The work which

18:35.682 --> 18:37.217
Professor Donaldson said
 was just good?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.819
And your abuela says
it's just great.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.155
(sighs)
Michael.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.524
Oh, wow, you're so much
taller than I thought.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.825
Oh. (laughs)

18:45.858 --> 18:48.761
Okay, I will leave you
two lovebirds alone.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.499
I'll be looking for
you in my inbox, Jane.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.301
Waiting to be wowed.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.936
Terrific. Thank... thank you.
Thank you so much.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.938
(sighs)
Alba's publishing friend?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.673
Oh. What do I do?

19:00.707 --> 19:02.942
Professor Donaldson says
I shouldn't send it yet,

19:02.975 --> 19:04.811
but she does
hate romance.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.347
Do you think
it's ready?
I don't know.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.516
Will you read it?

19:09.549 --> 19:11.318
Of course. I'm dying to.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.720
But I need you to give
me an honest opinion.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.460
ROGELIO:
 Honestly?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.429
These shorts are amazing!

19:22.462 --> 19:25.432
It's like a purse, but in
pants form. So many pockets.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.734
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Looks like Rogelio is enjoying
 his new job.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.736
And I can display my calves,

19:29.769 --> 19:32.239
which are the best part
of my lower legs.
Okay.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.307
Well, you're an electric
today, so...

19:34.341 --> 19:36.676
finish wrapping up that cable,
put it over there.

19:36.709 --> 19:40.347
Wrap it in...
like newspaper?

19:40.380 --> 19:46.586
Pick it up, wind it up,
put it over there.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.956
Consider it wrapped. Wow.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.892
I got to get all
the lingo down.
Hmm.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.896
(sighs)

19:56.929 --> 19:58.865
Oh, boy, it's heavier
than I thought.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.334
* When you face
a scary challenge... *

20:01.368 --> 20:05.672
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, my God, it's the
 world-famous Din-o-mites!

20:05.705 --> 20:08.375
As soon as they take a break,
I am tackling that stegosaurus

20:08.408 --> 20:09.942
and triple-confirming
they're free tomorrow.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.812
Yes! Go, Team Mateo!

20:12.845 --> 20:14.347
Yay!

20:14.381 --> 20:16.983
(babbles)
Yes! Yes.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.352
Hey, so, listen,
I wanted to talk to you

20:19.386 --> 20:21.621
about the Derek,
um, situation.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.756
PETRA:
Oh, there you are!

20:23.790 --> 20:26.293
Petra.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.528
Why are you here?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.963
I know how competitive the baby
birthday party market can be,

20:30.997 --> 20:33.300
so...

20:33.333 --> 20:34.634
I wanted to check
out these, um,

20:34.667 --> 20:37.737
dragon whatevers
for Anna and Elsa.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.372
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Translation:
 she didn't want Jane

20:39.406 --> 20:40.807
to be alone with Rafael.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.475
They're dinosaurs,
not dragons.
Same thing.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.377
Only not really.
One existed.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.413
The other is a fictitious
monster that breathes fire.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.748
Well, they certainly
look similar.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.483
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Something tells me
 this argument

20:50.517 --> 20:54.287
is about more
 than dragons versus dinosaurs.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.889
And they weren't the only ones
 having a tough day.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.561
MAN:
Rogelio, over here.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.430
(sighs, fabric tearing)

21:06.499 --> 21:09.302
(sighs)

21:12.839 --> 21:14.407
Finished, boss.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.775
Really?
Uh-huh.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.076
Ran all the cable?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.378
ROGELIO:
Uh-huh.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.079
Okay.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.581
Hit the
lights.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.752
(chuckling)

21:25.785 --> 21:28.087
I work out with a trainer
three times a week,

21:28.120 --> 21:31.858
but I never knew true
physical exertion until today.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.628
(gasps)
Have you guys considered

21:35.662 --> 21:38.030
releasing
a grip-electric workout DVD?

21:38.064 --> 21:39.632
You'd make
a fortune!
De la Vega,

21:39.666 --> 21:41.501
go to the truck,
get some sandbags.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.371
Got it, boss!
Great for the glutes.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.374
It's time
we kick things up a notch.
Agreed.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.676
Let's make a little
schedule change.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.982
What is going on here?

21:56.015 --> 21:58.985
This is lit for my good side,
not my great side!

21:59.018 --> 22:00.086
ROGELIO:
What does that mean,

22:00.119 --> 22:02.054
Jerry?
It means
we relight

22:02.088 --> 22:03.456
the whole
damn thing.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.358
All that work you
did this morning,

22:05.392 --> 22:06.859
you have to do it again.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.661
Hey! No, no, no!

22:08.695 --> 22:11.731
Too late. I already
got a great shot.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.400
Don't you dare
tweet that.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.435
(bird chirps)
(gasps)

22:19.672 --> 22:22.909
All's fair in the battle
for Sexiest Telenovela Star.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.148
How you holding up?

22:29.181 --> 22:33.019
Well, I am filled
with rage, Jerry.

22:33.052 --> 22:38.057
Which I will channel
into my cable duties.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.961
Really? Crashing
a kids' festival?

22:41.994 --> 22:44.030
I'm here for the same
reason you're here.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.965
To find a musical act
for my son's birthday.
Oh, please.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.501
You're trying to convince
Rafael that you know best.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.802
I'm trying to stop him
from doing something dangerous

22:49.836 --> 22:51.170
and stupid.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.039
Good. 'Cause my plan is smart.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.541
(scoffs)

22:54.574 --> 22:55.642
You haven't even heard it.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.644
Fine, Petra, tell me the plan.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.813
* No, you don't go on a picnic
with a T. rex *

23:00.847 --> 23:04.751
* If you do, I guarantee
you're gonna be vexed *

23:04.784 --> 23:06.152
* You can fill up your basket

23:06.185 --> 23:08.588
* With fruits and treats
and sweets *

23:08.621 --> 23:10.657
* But once that T. rex sees ya *

23:10.690 --> 23:12.592
* You'll be
just his kind of meat *

23:12.625 --> 23:15.495
* Yum, yum, yum, delicious...

23:15.528 --> 23:16.963
That's insane!

23:16.996 --> 23:19.065
It won't work.
RAFAEL:
Really? You guys

23:19.098 --> 23:20.032
aren't done arguing yet?

23:20.066 --> 23:21.501
(overlapping arguing)

23:21.534 --> 23:22.702
Stop,

23:22.735 --> 23:24.003
please.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.572
Look, I thought
about it,

23:25.605 --> 23:26.773
and...

23:26.806 --> 23:28.875
I'm gonna go with Petra's idea.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.843
(Mateo babbling)

23:30.877 --> 23:34.213
Okay. All right.
All right, Mateo.
(sighs)

23:34.246 --> 23:37.183
You know, it might
not be a competition.

23:37.216 --> 23:41.187
But I must say, it feels
good to finally win.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.156
* Yum, yum, yum, delicious.
(clapping)

23:48.828 --> 23:50.229
Beautiful.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.766
So much hair
and not a single nit.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.168
Yes, well, shampoo.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.071
Can I just say

23:59.105 --> 24:01.608
I liking
that Rafael listened to you.

24:01.641 --> 24:04.977
Me, too. This way, he has a
chance to get out of this mess.

24:05.011 --> 24:09.048
No. Because I think he is
starting to love you again.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.852
What?

24:12.885 --> 24:14.120
No.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.622
Yes.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.857
This is something
I have been seeing.

24:17.890 --> 24:22.629
The way he is looking at you...

24:22.662 --> 24:24.130
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Huh.

24:24.163 --> 24:27.033
It would seem
 Petra is warming to this idea.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.869
(Mateo coughing over speaker)
Aw. Mateo's a little warm,
poor thing.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.205
I gave him some Tylenol
and put on a humidifier.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.008
Michael?

24:36.042 --> 24:39.646
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ooh. That is cold, Michael.

24:39.679 --> 24:43.149
(coughing continues)

24:43.182 --> 24:46.686
(coughs loudly)
Sorry.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.090
Oh, my God, I'm...

24:51.123 --> 24:52.959
I fell asleep. I'm so sorry.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.661
No worries. Totally get it.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.195
It's, uh, late. Ish.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.531
For Mateo.
Jane,

24:58.565 --> 25:00.066
it's not the writing.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.934
That's great.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.804
But, you know,
romance, it's just...

25:04.837 --> 25:06.606
it's not my thing.

25:06.639 --> 25:10.176
Sure. Although you did
stay up all night

25:10.209 --> 25:12.111
reading Angelique Harper.
And I think

25:12.144 --> 25:15.247
your exact words were
"I couldn't put it down."

25:15.281 --> 25:18.918
I promised you
that I'd be brutally honest.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.787
It's not as good
as Angelique Harper.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.856
But how could it be?
It's your first one.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.726
I'm sure it took Angelique
a few tries to become...

25:26.759 --> 25:29.028
Angelique, right?

25:29.061 --> 25:31.030
Right.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.632
(coughing continues)
Yeah.

25:32.665 --> 25:35.167
(sighs heavily)

25:35.201 --> 25:37.336
MAN:
 Everybody up!

25:37.369 --> 25:39.772
Up!

25:39.806 --> 25:41.608
Federal Bureau
of Investigation.
Hands off

25:41.641 --> 25:43.209
your computer, sir.
Put your hands up.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.344
What the hell?
We have
a warrant.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.647
Start with the computers.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.154
Why'd you do this?

25:55.187 --> 25:56.589
I didn't.
Let's go,

25:56.623 --> 25:58.591
Mr. Solano.

25:58.625 --> 26:01.994
Petra, call my lawyer now!

26:02.028 --> 26:03.930
(Mateo coughing)
MICHAEL:
 He feeling any better?

26:05.297 --> 26:06.132
Poor guy.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.199
I know.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.935
What'd your mom say?
Well,

26:08.968 --> 26:10.637
if we move the wedding
to Thursday,

26:10.670 --> 26:12.338
she'll miss the actual ceremony.

26:12.371 --> 26:15.041
You're kidding.
Her boss has
this huge deposition that day.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.777
It was supposed to be Friday,
but they already moved it
so she could make

26:17.810 --> 26:20.046
the rehearsal dinner.
We can't get married
without your mom.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.816
My dad has to come through.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.685
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And, fortunately, he was.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.219
Okay. What's
next, boss?

26:27.253 --> 26:30.289
I just need you to change out
one last lightbulb.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.692
Terrific. Changing out
a lightbulb, a job so easy

26:32.725 --> 26:35.161
there's a series of jokes
about how easy it is.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.664
(chuckles) Up there.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.666
At this point,
 I'll remind you that Rogelio

26:39.699 --> 26:42.368
has a debilitating fear
 of heights.

26:42.401 --> 26:45.004
And leprechauns.
 But that's less pertinent.

26:48.708 --> 26:49.976
Are you all right?

26:50.009 --> 26:52.845
Raf, you were gone
for hours.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.213
(elevator bell dings)

26:54.246 --> 26:56.983
(sighs)

26:58.885 --> 27:00.887
It went great.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.723
Derek definitely
bought it. I saw him

27:03.756 --> 27:05.925
pacing the halls,
looking completely freaked out.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.760
He'll confront you, you'll get
him to confess to bribing you,

27:07.794 --> 27:10.029
end of story.

27:10.062 --> 27:13.399
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 That's right.
 The whole FBI raid was a setup!

27:13.432 --> 27:15.034
(elevator bell dings)

27:15.067 --> 27:18.170
Those are
 some great poker faces.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.773
Rogelio's, not so much.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.274
JERRY:
It's time to say
uncle, Rogelio!

27:22.308 --> 27:23.876
There's no shame
in it, man.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.144
Come on. Let's get you down.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.779
I can't.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.147
Rogelio, come on!

27:28.180 --> 27:29.448
I mean...

27:29.481 --> 27:31.217
I really can't.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.757
(coughing, crying)
Okay, Mr. Sweetface.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.959
I know. Maybe we should call
the pediatrician.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.696
What do you think? Oh, baby.
(phone rings)

27:43.730 --> 27:47.033
Hello? Hi, Jerry.
What's going on?

27:47.066 --> 27:48.234
(drilling)

27:48.267 --> 27:50.236
You heard me.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.838
What's going on?

27:51.871 --> 27:54.373
It wasn't me.
Why would I call the feds?

27:54.406 --> 27:57.076
I don't get the hotel
if they freeze your assets.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.444
What's in it for me?

27:58.477 --> 28:01.047
You tell me. We had a deal.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.182
I know.
You give me the...

28:03.215 --> 28:05.251
(loud drilling)
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Shoot! I can't

28:05.284 --> 28:06.886
make that out!
 What's he saying?

28:06.919 --> 28:08.888
Uh-oh.
 I'm guessing the recorder

28:08.921 --> 28:10.289
didn't pick it up either.

28:10.322 --> 28:13.225
(drilling stops)

28:13.259 --> 28:15.261
So you're telling me
it's not your fault.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.963
That's what I said.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.965
Because of our deal.

28:18.998 --> 28:23.135
I give you the hotel,
you don't turn me in.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.771
What?

28:24.804 --> 28:26.172
Well, is that
what you're saying?

28:26.205 --> 28:29.375
Where's the recorder?

28:29.408 --> 28:31.110
Or I call

28:31.143 --> 28:32.311
the police.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.749
Nine... one...

28:36.783 --> 28:37.817
Fine.

28:45.157 --> 28:47.226
(sighs)

28:48.294 --> 28:49.796
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, dear.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.063
JERRY:
He won't budge.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.367
It's been...
two hours.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.236
Can you keep an eye
on Mateo? He's sleeping.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.539
Okay. I'm going up.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.109
(exhales)

29:05.411 --> 29:07.113
(groans)
(whimpers)

29:07.146 --> 29:10.016
(sighs)

29:10.049 --> 29:12.819
They asked me to
change a lightbulb,

29:12.852 --> 29:15.487
but I just can't do it.
And I know

29:15.521 --> 29:17.156
what you're gonna say,
that it doesn't matter,

29:17.189 --> 29:18.991
that you love me...
Wrong.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.993
You're doing it.
What?!

29:21.027 --> 29:25.264
Otherwise, Michael's mom
can't come to the wedding.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.534
So stop being a baby,
walk this catwalk,

29:28.567 --> 29:31.170
and change
that freaking lightbulb!

29:39.311 --> 29:41.113
Sí... se... puede.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.849
Sí...

29:42.882 --> 29:44.917
Oh.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.887
(grunts, panting)

29:47.920 --> 29:49.521
No way he makes it.

29:49.555 --> 29:52.591
Sí... se... puede.

29:52.624 --> 29:53.993
Okay, I just...

29:54.026 --> 29:54.593
(grunts)

29:54.626 --> 29:57.229
(panting)

29:58.564 --> 30:01.067
*

30:17.183 --> 30:19.085
(laughs)

30:27.593 --> 30:30.429
He's been coughing a lot,
kind of wheezing.
(coughing)

30:30.462 --> 30:32.331
(sighs)

30:32.364 --> 30:34.901
(coughing continues)
Oh, baby,

30:34.934 --> 30:37.203
you're really warm.

30:37.236 --> 30:40.306
You know what, I'm
gonna call the doctor.
(crying)

30:40.339 --> 30:42.474
Uh, what you did up there,
for your daughter,

30:42.508 --> 30:44.076
um, I'm impressed.

30:44.110 --> 30:47.213
I know that was hard
for you.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.915
So I'll make due on my promise,

30:48.948 --> 30:51.050
and, uh, we'll hold off
on the strike.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.352
Thank you, Jerry.
Sure.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.354
Oh. Huh.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.924
Dad, I just got off the
phone with the doctor.

30:57.957 --> 31:01.260
He said that I should bring
Mateo into the E.R.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.201
(coughing)
You did the right thing
bringing him in.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.337
With the high fever
and wheezing, we need to do

31:11.370 --> 31:14.173
a chest X-ray
to rule out pneumonia.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.175
And we're gonna need
to do some blood work

31:16.208 --> 31:19.311
to rule out bacterial infection.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.512
Who wants
to hold him down?

31:20.546 --> 31:22.381
What?
While I draw blood.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.183
(sighs)

31:24.216 --> 31:26.185
Uh, me. Me. I'll do it.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.921
Shh...
DOCTOR: Hold tight.
No jerking.

31:28.955 --> 31:31.290
(Mateo screaming)

31:43.970 --> 31:44.971
He's okay.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.005
They ruled out serious

31:46.038 --> 31:47.273
infection, it's not pneumonia.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.041
Oh, thank God.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.209
But they do want
to keep him

31:50.242 --> 31:51.310
overnight, watch his breathing,

31:51.343 --> 31:52.678
make sure he's hydrated.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.446
We'll all stay.
No, no, no, no.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.481
You guys go.

31:55.514 --> 31:56.582
Seriously, it's a tiny room.

31:56.615 --> 31:57.649
Rafael and I have it.

31:57.683 --> 31:58.684
Are you sure?

31:58.717 --> 32:00.352
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.422
All right,
let's go, guys.

32:03.455 --> 32:04.590
I love you.
I love you, too.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.628
He still asleep?

32:09.661 --> 32:12.398
Out like a light.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.069
Hey, you okay?

32:18.437 --> 32:20.406
I'm just angry at myself.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.274
I should have called
the doctor earlier.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.443
Hey, come on.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.045
He got worse quickly.

32:26.078 --> 32:28.314
Yeah, he was sick,
I took him out.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.581
It was so stupid.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.284
Yeah, well...

32:32.318 --> 32:33.719
we all do stupid things.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.424
Petra's plan didn't work.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.026
Derek caught on.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.327
Oh, no.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.595
I signed over The Fairwick.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.465
Then... so...

32:46.498 --> 32:48.534
what now?
You just hope that Derek

32:48.567 --> 32:50.002
never brings it up again?

32:50.036 --> 32:51.137
Well, he got what he wanted.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.471
But when does it end?

32:52.504 --> 32:55.474
I mean, what if he
wants something else?

32:55.507 --> 32:59.378
The guy is bad news,
and I care about you, I...

33:03.515 --> 33:07.786
I just... I just hope
this is the end of it.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.289
(phones beep)

33:11.123 --> 33:13.392
Oh, my God.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.229
He's officially one.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.131
I can't believe it.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.633
(both laugh)

33:21.667 --> 33:23.269
(sighs)

33:23.302 --> 33:24.236
What?

33:24.270 --> 33:25.404
His party.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.538
Oh, my God,

33:26.572 --> 33:28.440
we have to cancel Mateo's party.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.512
Oh, hello,

33:33.545 --> 33:35.647
dear network executives.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.516
What are you doing here
at this late hour?

33:37.549 --> 33:39.518
Those two are in charge
of replacing our crew

33:39.551 --> 33:41.253
when we fire everyone on Friday.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.388
Wait, what?

33:42.421 --> 33:43.522
Before they strike.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.824
Why not just listen
to their concerns?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.659
Because we don't have to.
We can do the show

33:47.693 --> 33:48.827
without them.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.729
By the way,
congrats, you won

33:50.762 --> 33:51.797
Sexiest Telenovela Star.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.432
Two years running.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.840
Okay, tracked down curly fries.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.209
I love you.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.714
Thank you.

34:08.746 --> 34:12.217
I officially canceled
Mateo's birthday,

34:12.251 --> 34:15.187
which I probably should
have done a few days ago.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.255
What do you mean?

34:17.289 --> 34:19.391
I was overwhelmed,
there was so much going on,

34:19.425 --> 34:20.792
and my grandma pointed out

34:20.826 --> 34:23.094
it wasn't so much for him
as it was for us.

34:23.129 --> 34:26.364
Yeah, so what
if it was for us?

34:26.398 --> 34:29.335
I mean, we got him
through a whole year.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.737
Don't we deserve
to celebrate that?

34:31.770 --> 34:35.206
Yeah, we do.

34:35.241 --> 34:37.676
I can't believe it's been

34:37.708 --> 34:39.311
a year.

34:39.344 --> 34:42.248
It feels like
just yesterday.

34:42.281 --> 34:43.715
* Show me

34:43.748 --> 34:47.686
* Who I am
and who I could be... *

34:47.719 --> 34:49.221
When he was just a peach.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.556
* Initiate...

34:50.589 --> 34:53.458
The fetus is around three
inches long right now,

34:53.492 --> 34:54.826
about the size of a peach.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.496
* Properly...

34:57.529 --> 34:59.831
And then seeing him
for the first time.

34:59.865 --> 35:03.335
* And I'll run the risk...

35:03.369 --> 35:05.637
He's beautiful.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.873
* Of being intimate
with brokenness... *

35:07.906 --> 35:08.907
He's crawling!

35:08.940 --> 35:10.342
* Through
this magnifying glass *

35:10.376 --> 35:11.243
Oh, my God!

35:11.277 --> 35:12.611
Oh, my God.

35:12.644 --> 35:15.314
Oh, my God, Mateo,
you're cruising!

35:15.347 --> 35:16.848
(laughs)

35:16.882 --> 35:18.450
(laughing):
And when you first saw Bobby,

35:18.484 --> 35:20.786
and you nearly clobbered
that other mom.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.654
* Of being intimate
with brokenness *

35:22.688 --> 35:24.223
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, right, this was just

35:24.256 --> 35:25.357
before Michael returned.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.358
Do you see that?

35:26.392 --> 35:27.893
We need him.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.661
Ugh, it's so extravagant.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.230
When she and Rafael were

35:31.263 --> 35:33.232
just about to get
 back together.

35:33.265 --> 35:36.202
Come on, Mateo
only turns one once.

35:36.235 --> 35:39.338
Just... find out how to
get in touch with Bobby.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.273
Huh?
(gasps)

35:41.307 --> 35:43.909
* A thousand fingerprints

35:43.942 --> 35:45.211
It's true.

35:45.244 --> 35:46.645
A lot changes in a year.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.514
We did it.

35:50.416 --> 35:53.352
(sighing):
Yeah, we did.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.254
* Who I am...

35:55.287 --> 35:56.788
(sniffles)

36:00.526 --> 36:03.161
And a lot doesn't.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.969
XIOMARA:
Knock, knock.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.671
Since you decided
to cancel the party,

36:12.704 --> 36:14.473
we decided to bring
the party here.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.674
(chuckling): Oh.

36:15.707 --> 36:16.708
Hi.

36:19.645 --> 36:20.812
(chuckling):
You guys are so sweet,

36:20.846 --> 36:22.414
I just wish that
you had texted

36:22.448 --> 36:24.483
'cause we're getting
discharged any minute.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.421
I had the art department

36:29.455 --> 36:31.957
make this.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.859
I paid them this time,
don't worry.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.594
Mateo will think he had

36:35.627 --> 36:37.696
a party to rival North West's.

36:37.729 --> 36:38.830
Oh.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.366
Oh, and he's wearing

36:40.399 --> 36:42.000
his special birthday outfit.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.335
Oh, that is so...

36:43.369 --> 36:44.570
cute and weird.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.938
Thank you.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.809
* Cumpleaños

36:50.842 --> 36:52.911
* Feliz

36:52.944 --> 36:57.616
* Cumpleaños feliz

36:57.649 --> 37:02.921
* Cumpleaños, Mateo

37:02.954 --> 37:05.924
* Cumpleaños feliz.

37:05.957 --> 37:09.861
Hey, look.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.906
(laughing)

37:24.910 --> 37:25.877
So, listen.

37:25.911 --> 37:26.878
Huh?

37:26.912 --> 37:28.013
I have some bad news.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.615
I know you wanted
your wedding

37:29.648 --> 37:31.550
on Saturday, but I have to join

37:31.583 --> 37:32.618
the picket line on Friday.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.586
But you changed the lightbulb.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.422
They were gonna
walk out on Sunday.

37:36.455 --> 37:39.325
Telemasivo executives plan
to replace them before that,

37:39.358 --> 37:40.892
and I can't let that happen.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.861
I get that.

37:42.894 --> 37:45.631
I'll just find another venue
so that Michael's mom can come.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.333
Oh, no, I figured
that part out.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.334
Kenny,

37:48.367 --> 37:49.501
our second AC,

37:49.535 --> 37:50.636
has a sister who
flies helicopters,

37:50.669 --> 37:52.304
so for just $3,500,

37:52.338 --> 37:54.440
she will pick up
Michael's mother

37:54.473 --> 37:56.508
after her deposition
and deliver her to church

37:56.542 --> 37:57.909
with time to spare.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.578
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It should be noted,

37:59.611 --> 38:00.912
that this was just this
 type of crazy spending

38:00.946 --> 38:03.014
that Jane had been
 trying to curb.

38:03.048 --> 38:06.585
What the heck?
This is my wedding, fly her in.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.054
Oh, stop, you don't
have to read it.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.589
Just go back to Derek's case.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.723
No, I'm reading your book.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.058
Yeah,

38:13.091 --> 38:15.861
okay, but I decided,
I could do better.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.563
You know, I mean,

38:17.596 --> 38:21.400
I've changed so much
this past year, and that?

38:21.433 --> 38:22.468
That's like a...

38:22.501 --> 38:24.069
first pancake, you know?

38:24.102 --> 38:26.004
A little off. I want to give
Beverly the second pancake,

38:26.037 --> 38:27.873
which I told her
in non-pancake terms.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.441
What'd she say?
Oh, that

38:29.475 --> 38:30.976
she'll look for it
in the future. We'll see.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.711
I just...
(clicks tongue)

38:32.744 --> 38:35.013
I want to dig deeper.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.815
What?

38:36.848 --> 38:39.351
Dig deeper, in my writing.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.687
Dig deeper.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.321
I... will.

38:44.723 --> 38:45.957
No, what if there

38:45.991 --> 38:48.894
is something underneath
the Fairwick.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.462
What if they dug tunnels...

38:50.496 --> 38:52.364
tunnels that are
connected to the Marbella,

38:52.398 --> 38:54.099
tunnels that
were filled in,

38:54.132 --> 38:55.701
when we found the
plastic surgery suites.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.103
Maybe that's why this
hotel is so important.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.872
Maybe this is where
the missing money is.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.108
Think about it, why else would
Mutter need the Fairwick?

39:03.141 --> 39:05.110
That's got to be where
she stashed the money.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.978
SUSANNA:
Cordero, we don't
have a warrant.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.648
You don't think Derek could take
200 million bucks and flee?

39:09.681 --> 39:11.149
Exigent circumstances.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.484
No warrant needed.

39:12.518 --> 39:15.120
Meet me there.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.725
Hello?

39:19.758 --> 39:21.092
Is anyone here?

39:21.126 --> 39:23.962
(metal banging)

39:30.536 --> 39:31.837
What the...?

39:31.870 --> 39:32.838
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Is it the money?

39:32.871 --> 39:37.042
Wait, no, it's...

39:43.214 --> 39:44.883
Don't worry.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.918
I left her in the Fairwick,
and I'm in the air...

39:46.952 --> 39:49.087
with the money.

39:50.589 --> 39:51.657
(knocking on door)

39:51.690 --> 39:52.924
JANE:
It's open!

39:57.463 --> 39:58.830
Oh, uh...

39:58.864 --> 40:01.467
I thought you were Rafael.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.069
I'm here to apologize...
profusely.

40:04.102 --> 40:05.103
(laughs)

40:05.136 --> 40:07.806
For, um...

40:07.839 --> 40:10.509
for snapping at you at the park.

40:10.542 --> 40:11.877
That was not...

40:11.910 --> 40:13.078
Din-o-mite?

40:13.111 --> 40:14.079
...kind of me.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.482
I know...

40:16.515 --> 40:17.716
it's not a competition.

40:17.749 --> 40:18.984
Yeah, well...

40:19.017 --> 40:20.919
I'm starting to think
it is, actually.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.120
Excuse me?

40:22.153 --> 40:23.154
And I do hope Rafael comes

40:23.188 --> 40:24.189
to me for advice more.

40:24.222 --> 40:25.791
What?!
Because

40:25.824 --> 40:26.992
I won't tell him to do

40:27.025 --> 40:29.027
crazy things like staging a fake

40:29.060 --> 40:31.096
FBI raid.
Well, I was trying
something at least.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.764
The wrong thing.

40:32.798 --> 40:34.232
Oh, will you
stop already?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.034
There is no right or wrong,

40:36.067 --> 40:37.736
Jane.
That is not true.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.437
So, you think it's right
for him to go to jail?

40:40.739 --> 40:43.174
Look, you're an
optimist, that's all,

40:43.208 --> 40:44.976
and I'm a realist,
and I'm getting tired of you

40:45.010 --> 40:46.845
assuming that you're
the better person.

40:53.819 --> 40:56.622
Which brings us here, now.

40:56.655 --> 40:57.989
How's it going, Petra?

40:59.024 --> 41:01.627
Perfectly, really.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.762
I think Rafael has
feelings for me again.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.565
He can see I'm the person
for him, not Jane.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.567
Very funny.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.969
(laughs)

41:11.002 --> 41:13.705
Well, I wanting to be sounding
like beautiful sister.

41:13.739 --> 41:15.140
Did it work?

41:15.173 --> 41:16.608
Yes.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.476
Well done, Anezka.

41:20.612 --> 41:23.882
Wig is not perfect,
but I do better next time.

41:27.185 --> 41:28.554
I can see what

41:28.587 --> 41:29.855
Petra seeing in
him, actually.

41:29.888 --> 41:30.856
He-he is

41:30.889 --> 41:33.258
being very charming.

41:33.291 --> 41:36.261
You stay away from that man.

41:36.294 --> 41:37.563
Don't worry.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.831
I won't mess up plan

41:39.865 --> 41:41.900
we have spent whole
year working on.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.035
Wow.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.503
Has it been year already?

41:47.005 --> 41:49.608
Time flies.
