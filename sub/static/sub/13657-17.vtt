11:22.549 --> 11:24.449
About a terror threat

The mercedes that blew up
this morning,

by that guy there.

to the dealership staff,

11:42.202 --> 11:44.235
The mercedes was on the lot
for five days.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.870
It was never
test-driven.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.173
And it had just been cleaned
and serviced two days ago.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.878
That he had never driven
without checking it out,

11:53.880 --> 11:55.914
Which means he wasn't
feeling that threatened.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.749
Or he wasn't the target
to begin with.

to drive it.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.129
Signing in downstairs.
Okay.

19:58.131 --> 20:01.032
Sharon, amy's waiting for me
to start my s.I.S. Briefing.

20:01.034 --> 20:04.635
Okay. Good luck.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.774
Sharon...
I can handle this.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.710
Please,
just...Don't worry.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.212
Right.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.547
[ telephones ringing ]

20:16.549 --> 20:18.549
[ indistinct announcement ]

20:18.551 --> 20:20.117
[ sighs ]

20:23.222 --> 20:24.722
Come on, sykes.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.159
We all know the real reason
you left s.I.S.

20:28.161 --> 20:30.828
Ah, you know, if amy worked
for me any longer,

20:30.830 --> 20:33.998
She would have shot too many
people to ever make captain.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.735
Lieutenant cooper will be
the s.I.S. Supervisor

20:37.737 --> 20:39.237
On your operation.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.072
You know what amy's
secret goal is, don't you?

20:41.074 --> 20:43.574
That she wants to be
part of the brass.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.509
And you don't get to be
all brassy

20:45.511 --> 20:47.545
By shooting people,
now, do you?

20:47.547 --> 20:52.283
So...This is our number one
for tomorrow, eh?

20:52.285 --> 20:53.884
What?
During the operation,

20:53.886 --> 20:56.120
Your radio call name
will be "number one."

20:56.122 --> 20:57.955
Oh. Beats being called
number two.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.858
Oh, you're very funny,
mr. Jump street.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.126
Yeah, all --
all I meant was that --

21:02.128 --> 21:04.695
Oh, very funny.
Now, sit down.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.763
Impress me.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.531
I want to be impressed

21:07.533 --> 21:10.901
Because there's no way I'm
putting some kid on the street

21:10.903 --> 21:14.739
Unless I know he's going to
cooperate with me 1,000%.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.374
Got that, jump street?

21:16.376 --> 21:19.543
I want to be impressed.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.313
Let's go, sykes.

21:23.882 --> 21:26.817
This is a map of the ground
you'll cover tomorrow.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.819
This is the condo.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.656
This is your one and only
driving route to the chess park

21:31.658 --> 21:33.324
And these are
the chess tables

21:33.326 --> 21:35.726
Inside your one and only
safe zone at the park.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.662
You will not deviate
from the route

21:37.664 --> 21:39.130
Or step outside
of the safe zone.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.932
Why?
Oh, excellent question.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.902
You see, any deviation
from your agreed-upon movements

21:44.904 --> 21:46.604
Will be interpreted as distress

21:46.606 --> 21:49.307
And an undercover element
will respond.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.108
And that response
can get people killed.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.978
You'll be under surveillance
by s.I.S. Here,

21:53.980 --> 21:55.479
Here, here,
here, and here.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.315
We call that
covering the compass.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.850
We do it right,
it should look and feel like

21:59.852 --> 22:01.252
You're completely alone.

22:01.254 --> 22:02.353
Alone?

22:02.355 --> 22:04.121
B-b-b-but what about you

22:04.123 --> 22:06.190
And lieutenant provenza
and detective sanchez?

22:06.192 --> 22:08.426
Rusty, we're trying
to draw the suspect out.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.027
He has to believe
you're not being watched

22:10.029 --> 22:11.529
Or he won't even try
to approach you.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.863
Now, there's every possibility

22:12.865 --> 22:14.665
He knows each detective
in major crimes.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.133
Wait, wait, wait.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.835
So, none of you guys
are even gonna be with me?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.770
Anyone you know will be
well outside of the perimeter.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.339
But don't you worry,
jump street.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.341
You will be fully covered
by my people.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.276
How will I know
who they are?
You won't.

22:25.278 --> 22:26.711
But what if I --
what if I need help?

22:26.713 --> 22:28.779
What if I have to do something
that's different

22:28.781 --> 22:30.548
Than what we had
originally planned?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.783
Listen, kid. There will be
no improvisation --

22:32.785 --> 22:34.452
You got that?
None whatsoever.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.620
That's what I'm trying to get
through your thick head.

22:36.622 --> 22:39.557
Now, if you don't want the name
rusty beck to be the subject

22:39.559 --> 22:41.492
Of a very sad
after-action meeting,

22:41.494 --> 22:43.894
You will do everything exactly
as I tell you.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.898
Ted sr.: The doctor just said
it was shock.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.668
I guess I wasn't ready
for something like this.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.470
Yeah, well, who is?

22:52.472 --> 22:54.705
My only child.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.340
[ sighs ]

22:56.342 --> 22:59.009
You mentioned
there was another bomb.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.344
Where is it?

23:00.346 --> 23:01.679
Well, we were hoping

23:01.681 --> 23:03.714
That you might be able
to help us with that.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.916
How?
Well, you could start

23:05.918 --> 23:08.986
By giving us a list of the
employees fired by your son.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.554
Ray: Oh, my god.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.057
You seem to have omitted
that yesterday, mr. Winters.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.693
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. The
police -- I lied to the police.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.896
They're going to arrest me.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Mr. Winters. Mr. Winters!

23:18.898 --> 23:20.364
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
It's fine.

23:20.366 --> 23:23.200
Lying to the police
is not against the law.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.903
Oh? Really?

23:25.905 --> 23:28.005
I...Did not know that.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.007
But we don't love it.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.409
Ted sr.: Don't blame ray.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.677
I told him
to withhold that information.

23:33.679 --> 23:36.947
I thought you might look
at the names of the people

23:36.949 --> 23:40.284
My son laid off
as a list of suspects.

23:40.286 --> 23:42.086
But no one, none of my employees

23:42.088 --> 23:45.022
Could not have had anything
to do with little ted's death.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.024
They only found out
they were being fired

23:47.026 --> 23:49.727
When they got their pink slips
yesterday, and by that time,

23:49.729 --> 23:51.629
That bomb was already
on that car.

23:53.865 --> 23:57.868
And that was his last act
on this earth.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.703
He gave them no warning!

23:59.705 --> 24:01.639
Some of those people
had been with me for decades.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.774
To let them go
during the holidays?

24:03.776 --> 24:06.477
[ sighs ]
I failed my son.

24:06.479 --> 24:07.945
I tried to get him to do
the right thing,

24:07.947 --> 24:09.613
But I failed him somehow.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.816
Mr. King,
your son was a grown man.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.051
You are not responsible
for his actions.

24:14.053 --> 24:17.555
Wasn't it my job to lead him
into a mature adulthood?

24:17.557 --> 24:20.124
Why did he start
turning everyone against me?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.793
His mother left him
her share of the business.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.161
My brother left him his.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.630
Somehow, after 40 years
of selling cars,

24:26.632 --> 24:27.765
Well, I don't know anything.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.099
We understand
that little ted

24:29.101 --> 24:31.769
Wanted to take more
of your business online.

24:31.771 --> 24:32.937
Which was bullshit!

24:32.939 --> 24:35.573
Uh, well, uh,
not exactly, big ted.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.942
On the beta test
that darren set up,

24:37.944 --> 24:40.778
Uh, people buying cars
from our website showed

24:40.780 --> 24:42.980
We would make an extra
$1 million a year, actually.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.182
We just deliver the car
from our inventory --

24:45.184 --> 24:47.351
And turn our dealership
into a parking lot.

24:47.353 --> 24:51.155
And losing some of my company
to his wife.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.524
No one in my family's
ever been divorced before.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.758
Awful!

24:54.760 --> 24:56.994
Yeah. And he left olivia
for a man.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.196
Well, I don't care about that.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.199
Some people like automatic.
Some people like manuals.

25:02.201 --> 25:05.436
But little ted's refusal
to keep his vows

25:05.438 --> 25:08.038
Was allowing olivia
to destroy our profitability!

25:08.040 --> 25:09.673
How?
What was olivia doing?

25:09.675 --> 25:14.111
Uh, s-she was suing

25:14.113 --> 25:18.115
To have a forensic accountant
look over our books.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.651
You see, ted king auto sales
is a corporation

25:20.653 --> 25:22.353
With several dba accounts.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.021
We don't do anything illegal,

25:24.023 --> 25:26.323
But some of our
floating inventory estimates

25:26.325 --> 25:27.825
Might confuse the irs.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.227
You know, big ted, if you
let us look at your books,

25:30.229 --> 25:32.663
They would then become evidence
in your son's death

25:32.665 --> 25:34.832
And it would take
a lot longer

25:34.834 --> 25:37.535
For olivia's accountants
to gain access.

25:37.537 --> 25:40.671
No, no, no, no.
We're not gonna let you do that.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.740
Look through my house
all you want.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.376
But I'll thank you
to stay out of my wallet.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.315
Excuse me.

25:51.317 --> 25:54.585
[ door opens, closes ]

25:54.587 --> 25:56.587
Lieutenant reid
located the second bomb.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.856
Oh, thank god.
Where was it?

25:58.858 --> 26:01.258
Underneath
ray winters' car.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.662
The comptroller.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.597
Do we know
if the second bomb

26:06.599 --> 26:08.699
Was remotely activated,
as well?

26:08.701 --> 26:11.368
Reid: Rather than drive
through the streets

26:11.370 --> 26:14.872
Towing an incendiary device
on the back of our vehicle,

26:14.874 --> 26:18.075
Perform a forced detonation
in the containment truck.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.777
He means we're blowing up
the bomb.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.612
Flynn: Hey, guys!

26:21.614 --> 26:25.049
Just finished the search of
olivia king's personal vehicle.

26:25.051 --> 26:28.919
No bomb, obviously.
But we did find this --

26:28.921 --> 26:32.089
An after-market key fob that
did not work on her own car.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.224
Lieutenant.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.593
Please proceed
with extreme caution.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.561
This could be the remote
detonator to our bomb.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.563
Well, there's one quick way
to find out.

26:39.565 --> 26:40.698
Hold on.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.832
We good?

26:42.767 --> 26:44.768
Okay.

26:51.476 --> 26:53.544
Can I give it a shot?

26:53.546 --> 26:57.448
I just tried it.
You saw me try it.

26:57.450 --> 26:58.482
Could be
the plastic bag.

26:58.484 --> 27:01.151
[ sighs ]

27:02.320 --> 27:04.388
I think the panic button
might work better

27:04.390 --> 27:06.724
And maybe if you move
a little closer.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.325
Watch it, mike, okay?

27:08.327 --> 27:09.793
Tao:
The bomb containment chamber

27:09.795 --> 27:11.395
Should give me
all the protection I need.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.429
Right, lieutenant reid?

27:12.431 --> 27:13.530
Uh, theoretically.

27:17.068 --> 27:18.435
Fire in the hole!

27:18.437 --> 27:20.638
[ clicking ]

27:20.640 --> 27:22.973
Eh? Eh?

27:24.109 --> 27:25.676
Maybe I'm out of range.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.344
And maybe
it's the wrong fob.

27:27.346 --> 27:31.015
All right, close enough.
Close enough!

27:31.017 --> 27:32.783
Okay.

27:32.785 --> 27:35.452
Well, fire in the hole?

27:35.454 --> 27:37.588
[ explosion ]

27:39.491 --> 27:40.524
[ chuckles ]

27:40.526 --> 27:42.693
Provenza:
All right, flynn.

27:42.695 --> 27:45.095
When is a bomb
not just a bomb?

27:45.097 --> 27:46.864
When it's a smoking gun.

27:55.573 --> 27:57.107
Buzz:
Say something, rusty.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.809
Something rusty.

27:58.811 --> 28:01.779
Oh. Highly original,
jump street.

28:01.781 --> 28:05.315
Now, what is the most important
thing you have to do?

28:05.317 --> 28:06.817
Stick with the plan.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.852
Where are you going today
and every day?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.521
To the park to play chess.
Good.

28:10.523 --> 28:12.389
Now, remember,
you will be covered

28:12.391 --> 28:14.558
The minute you leave
the garage downstairs.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.727
Just don't try to figure out
how or by whom.

28:16.729 --> 28:19.363
I will act
like a zombie.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.298
Now, you stay
in the prearranged safe zone

28:21.300 --> 28:24.234
And you signal distress
or threat by...

28:24.236 --> 28:28.672
Rubbing the back of my head
three times with my left hand.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.140
All right.

28:30.142 --> 28:34.244
You just graduated from
jump street to number one.

28:34.246 --> 28:37.748
Now, you do everything
exactly as I tell you,

28:37.750 --> 28:39.683
And we will catch
this son of a bitch

28:39.685 --> 28:41.018
Who's been threatening you.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.153
Okay.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.422
I can finish that.

28:45.424 --> 28:48.625
All right, buzz.
Let's do a radio check.

28:52.764 --> 28:54.565
Is this too tight?

28:54.567 --> 28:55.899
Um, you know what?
Yeah, yeah.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.167
Maybe just
a little looser.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.503
I kind of
can't feel my fingers.

28:59.505 --> 29:02.906
I thought so.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.275
There.
Now, relax your shoulders.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.711
Breathe.

29:07.713 --> 29:11.248
Both:
[ breathes deeply ]

29:13.384 --> 29:14.852
Believe it or not,

29:14.854 --> 29:17.387
Being a little nervous
is a good sign.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.523
It means that
you're taking this seriously,

29:19.525 --> 29:22.760
Which I really appreciate.

29:27.132 --> 29:30.868
Here is your jacket

29:30.870 --> 29:34.972
And your chess pieces
are inside your backpack.

29:34.974 --> 29:37.674
And your lunch.

And your pepper spray.

You ready?

Number one is on the move.

30:00.598 --> 30:02.132
Don't worry.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.935
The bad guy's probably not
gonna show up the first day.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.503
Probably.

30:41.606 --> 30:44.041
I have never seen that
thingamajig in my life.

30:44.043 --> 30:47.544
Ma'am, we used that fob
we found in your car

30:47.546 --> 30:49.513
To remotely detonate a bomb

30:49.515 --> 30:52.816
We removed from ray winters'
personal vehicle.

30:52.818 --> 30:55.352
What?! Ray?

30:55.354 --> 30:56.720
Why would I kill ray?

30:56.722 --> 30:58.555
God, as my attorney,

30:58.557 --> 31:01.458
Aren't you supposed to, like,
object to them or something?

31:01.460 --> 31:02.659
Not yet.

31:02.661 --> 31:06.363
The bomb found
in mr. Winters' car,

31:06.365 --> 31:09.366
Was it similar to the one
that, uh, blew up little ted?

31:09.368 --> 31:10.534
Identical.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.970
Both keyed
to remote detonation.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.806
Correct.
One moment.

31:15.808 --> 31:17.541
Mrs. King,
with your husband gone,

31:17.543 --> 31:19.910
Is it true that you now own
part of the business?

31:19.912 --> 31:23.046
Yes, but big ted already
offered to buy me out.

31:23.048 --> 31:26.216
So, um, you've decided
to sell to him.

31:26.218 --> 31:29.086
Well, I sued to get their books,
but it's gonna take forever

31:29.088 --> 31:31.054
To figure out
what everything's worth.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.422
There's so many accounts.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.665

31:41.667 --> 31:43.700
We do.
Two days ago,

31:45.070 --> 31:47.204
To turn over all
of the dealership's books.

31:47.206 --> 31:51.675
And according to this
transcript, a court reporter

31:51.677 --> 31:58.248
Has olivia on the stand
from 11:27 and 11:56 a.M.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.717
And little ted blew up
at...

32:00.719 --> 32:03.387

32:03.389 --> 32:04.688

United States or...

32:09.194 --> 32:11.228
More like
within 100 feet.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.931
Olivia was 15 miles away
at the time.

32:13.933 --> 32:16.033
So unless you can prove
to a jury

32:16.035 --> 32:17.768
That she was two places
at once --

32:17.770 --> 32:19.369
Thank you, gary.
That's right.

32:19.371 --> 32:20.804
Everyone thought

32:20.806 --> 32:22.439
I was coming into the dealership
that morning.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.974
I only pretended I was coming in
so they wouldn't know

32:23.976 --> 32:25.542
I was getting a court order
forcing them

32:25.544 --> 32:26.877
To turn over
all of their books.

32:26.879 --> 32:29.780
Okay, olivia.
Um, mr. Bridges?

32:29.782 --> 32:31.081
Mm-hmm.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.984
Um, we might be able
to look the other way

32:33.986 --> 32:38.989
On this "key fob responsible
for detonating a bomb" business

32:38.991 --> 32:40.891
Under one condition.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.764
You started the interview
with big ted already?

32:47.766 --> 32:49.733
Tao's bringing him in now.

32:50.935 --> 32:53.437
How's rusty doing
so far?

32:53.439 --> 32:55.672
Got a good appetite.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.607
Ray sr.:
<i>It's hard to believe</i>

32:57.609 --> 32:59.142
<i>Olivia would do</i>
<i>something like this</i>

32:59.144 --> 33:01.244
<i>To her own business.</i>

33:01.246 --> 33:04.147
But I guess when you screw
with the human heart,

33:04.149 --> 33:05.649
All bets are off.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.652
But would she try
and kill your comptroller?

33:08.654 --> 33:11.188
Because she got no sense.
Does she, ray?

33:11.190 --> 33:14.324
Yeah, well,
that's why we need your help.

33:15.526 --> 33:18.762
See, we've been going over
the dealership's bank accounts.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.832
Son of a bitch!
How did you get those?!

33:21.834 --> 33:23.767
Olivia gave us a little peek.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.535
Ray: Oh, god.

33:25.537 --> 33:26.770
Is that why you read us
our rights?

33:26.772 --> 33:28.538
Partly.

33:28.540 --> 33:32.109
Anyway, you've got a lot of
different business names here.

33:32.111 --> 33:35.178
Ted king automotive,
ted king motors, ted king --

33:35.180 --> 33:37.714
We do that for balancing
inventory over fiscal quarters.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.049
Standard industry practice.

33:39.051 --> 33:41.151
We're not really interested
in that,

33:41.153 --> 33:44.054
But we do have a question
about one of your accounts.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.456
"ted king auto."

33:46.458 --> 33:49.026
You mean
ted king auto sales.

33:49.028 --> 33:52.129
No, not ted king auto sales.
That's your primary account.

33:52.131 --> 33:56.800
The one we're interested in...
Is ted king auto.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.202
Well, there is no account
called ted king auto.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.904
Tell them, ray.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.706
Oh, uh, it's news to me.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.142
Ted king auto, huh?
No, never heard of that.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.410
Really?

34:06.412 --> 34:08.645
Because the ted king auto
account

34:08.647 --> 34:12.749
Has fairly consistent deposits
and withdrawals.

34:12.751 --> 34:16.453
Every week, $1,000 in,
$1,000 out.

34:17.688 --> 34:21.525
Well, maybe little ted kept this

34:21.527 --> 34:23.927
As kind of a slush fund
for that darren kid.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.430
Well, except...

34:26.432 --> 34:29.533
The ted king auto account
was opened 31 years ago,

34:29.535 --> 34:31.768
When little ted
was really little.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.570
Like 2.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.605
You add up all this money,

34:35.607 --> 34:40.544
And it comes
to $1,978,456.31.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.512
<i>We have</i>
<i>an electronic picture</i>

34:42.514 --> 34:44.214
<i>Of some of the checks</i>
<i>deposited</i>

34:44.216 --> 34:46.683
And they all say the same thing
<i>on the memo line.</i>

34:46.685 --> 34:48.351
<i>Can you read this,</i>
<i>mr. King?</i>

34:48.353 --> 34:51.021
Mm.
"lifetime warranty."

34:51.023 --> 34:54.257
Well, we try to sell one
of those with every vehicle

34:54.259 --> 34:57.294
Because it's a significant
source of revenue.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.129
Mainly because it doesn't cover
all the things

34:59.131 --> 35:00.697
That go wrong in the car.

35:00.699 --> 35:04.701
Because our automobiles
are 100% guaranteed pre-owned.

35:04.703 --> 35:08.772
Plus that covers free car washes
for life -- for life!

35:08.774 --> 35:11.641
Well, about once a week
when one of your customers

35:11.643 --> 35:14.578
Purchased a lifetime
or free car washes for $1,000,

35:14.580 --> 35:17.247
They were told to make
the check out to ted king auto

35:17.249 --> 35:18.915
Instead of the usual account.

35:18.917 --> 35:22.919
So, our question to you,
mr. Winters, is can you give us

35:22.921 --> 35:24.287
The name attached to
the cayman island bank account

35:24.289 --> 35:25.689
Where all this money went?

35:26.791 --> 35:29.759
[ chuckles ]
how should I know?

35:29.761 --> 35:31.394
Because
you're the comptroller.

35:31.396 --> 35:32.896
Aren't you in charge

35:32.898 --> 35:34.664
Of all the transactions
at the dealership?

35:34.666 --> 35:35.999

to all the accounts,

35:36.001 --> 35:37.334
Including
the corporate credit cards?

35:37.336 --> 35:39.336
Which were used
to purchase the material

35:39.338 --> 35:41.138
In the bomb
that killed little ted.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.639
Ray:
Now, I wasn't the only one

35:42.641 --> 35:44.407
Who had access
to little ted's credit cards.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.243
Olivia also had --
wait a sec.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.911
We didn't say
little ted's credit card.

35:47.913 --> 35:50.080
Just that it was
a corporate account.

35:50.082 --> 35:53.683
Oh, uh, did I -- did I misspeak?

35:53.685 --> 35:55.018
A little.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.820
Ted sr.: Wait a minute.
L-let's go back.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.488
I don't understand.
Why would ray --

35:58.490 --> 35:59.823
Tao:
It's very simple, sir.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.192
Ray here
was embezzling from you.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.693
Your son
was getting divorced.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.295
His wife hired an accountant

36:05.297 --> 36:07.330
To go over
your financial records,

36:07.332 --> 36:09.799
Which meant ray
was about to be found out.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.636
So he tried to halt
the process by...

36:12.638 --> 36:14.104
By blowing up my son?!

36:14.106 --> 36:17.607
I think that was more
of a panic response.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.476
The mercedes s.U.V.

36:19.478 --> 36:22.946
Was originally intended
for olivia.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.548
Tao: So, with her
out of the way, the divorce,

36:24.550 --> 36:26.850
The request to see
the dealership's books

36:26.852 --> 36:28.051
Would go up in smoke.

36:28.053 --> 36:29.519
But olivia wouldn't take
the mercedes.

36:29.521 --> 36:33.023
Am I right?
So you switched targets.

36:33.025 --> 36:36.960
The divorce would still go away
with little ted gone.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.629
Well, that doesn't make
any sense.

36:39.631 --> 36:42.966
There was a bomb on my car.
Someone was trying to kill me.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.068
No one was trying
to kill you.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.337
You put that bomb
on your own car

36:47.339 --> 36:49.839
To take suspicion
away from yourself.

36:49.841 --> 36:50.974
Ray?

36:50.976 --> 36:53.076
Now, now, now, now, big ted,

36:53.078 --> 36:55.078
They're just painting this
picture the worst possible way.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.714
You killed my boy
for a lousy $1,000 a week?!
Hey, let go of me!

36:57.716 --> 37:00.050
You son of a bitch!

37:00.052 --> 37:01.518
Such a lousy $1,000 a week,

37:01.520 --> 37:03.653
Why didn't you add it
to my paycheck?!

37:03.655 --> 37:04.988
You never
treated me right.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.556
Your son treated me
like a servant.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.425
The day little ted came in
to work, he acted like

37:08.427 --> 37:09.826
He knew better
than everyone else

37:09.828 --> 37:11.595
And you never bothered
to teach him

37:11.597 --> 37:13.897
The basics
of ordinary respect!
You have no right to talk --

I think I should get a lawyer

37:26.378 --> 37:28.011
And see if there's some way
to work all this out.

37:28.013 --> 37:31.848
Oh, I think that
we could get you a deal

37:31.850 --> 37:35.852
With a lifetime guarantee,
mr. Winters.

37:35.854 --> 37:40.423
First, of course, we'll have
to run it by our manager.

37:40.425 --> 37:43.560
Well, I'll see
what we can do.

Yeah, I could go
for another.

Okay.

Keep packing up.

Walk calmly.
Go to your car.

No. Amy, there's a guy
