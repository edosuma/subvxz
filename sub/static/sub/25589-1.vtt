[audience applauding and cheering]

00:36.578 --> 00:38.121
Hello, London!

00:38.247 --> 00:40.249
[audience cheering]

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
That's my town.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.006
Uh...

00:48.090 --> 00:49.967
This is my second home.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.385
[audience cheering]

00:52.678 --> 00:54.680
I lived here for ten years.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.098
I love London.

00:56.181 --> 00:59.226
I actually recorded
a couple of specials here before.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.938
When I lived here, I was broke.
I had no fucking money.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.275
And maybe like 12 years ago,

01:06.358 --> 01:07.776
I signed a contract

01:08.360 --> 01:12.114
for five comedy specials for £90,000

01:12.197 --> 01:15.325
with a record label over here,
which, when you're broke...

01:17.619 --> 01:20.414
sounds like a really good
fucking deal, right?

01:20.831 --> 01:23.625
I had no money
and someone offered me £90,000,

01:23.709 --> 01:26.670
I was like, "Fuck, yeah,"
for five comedy specials.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.548
But that is the worst deal
in record history.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.509
Five comedy specials for £90,000.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.596
Anyway, I was locked in.
I recorded one,

01:35.929 --> 01:39.391
and then I got offered
an HBO special in America.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.227
And so I went back to my record label
over here,

01:42.311 --> 01:43.937
and I said, "Hey, here's the deal.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.023
I just got offered a big deal in America.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.899
What I'll do is I'll go over there,

01:47.983 --> 01:51.737
I'll do the special then I'll come back
and do the other four specials with you."

01:51.820 --> 01:53.905
And then my record label here went,

01:53.989 --> 01:56.825
"You can't do that.
You're contracted to us,"

01:56.908 --> 01:59.453
and I went, "Oh, that's a shame."

01:59.911 --> 02:01.413
[audience laughing]

02:01.913 --> 02:04.666
Then I got on a plane
and I went to America.

02:07.002 --> 02:10.881
And then HBO said, "You sorted
that contract problem out, didn't ya?"

02:10.964 --> 02:12.883
And I went, "I sure did."

02:15.052 --> 02:17.471
And then I did the HBO special

02:17.554 --> 02:21.391
and then my record label here
sued me for £200,000,

02:21.475 --> 02:25.562
which is like, $300,000 American, right?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.981
But it doesn't matter,

02:28.065 --> 02:31.526
because HBO paid me $50,000, so...

02:31.610 --> 02:32.819
[audience laughing]

02:32.986 --> 02:35.697
So, you gotta spend money
to make money, you know?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.742
So I was a little bit in the hole.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.622
I had spent a lot of that earlier money
on drugs already.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.377
So now I'm...

02:48.835 --> 02:50.379
I'm poor and famous.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.715
See, everybody wants to be
rich and famous.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.218
And rich and famous is fucking amazing.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.179
Poor and famous sucks dicks.

03:00.722 --> 03:04.226
Have you ever been in a pound store
and been famous? That's...

03:06.311 --> 03:08.772
So anyways, I'm poor and famous, right?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.982
So I have sex with this American woman...

03:11.108 --> 03:14.152
Consensually! I asked her.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.613
She said yes, she enjoyed herself.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.739
Anyway...

03:19.741 --> 03:22.953
So I had sex with this woman,
and she thought, 'cause I was on the TV,

03:23.036 --> 03:24.079
that I had money.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.749
So she tried to extort me for $50,000.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.170
She goes, "I have a sex tape of yours,
and I'm going to sell it."

03:33.338 --> 03:36.049
And I went, "Fucking try."

03:36.133 --> 03:37.259
[audience laughing]

03:38.135 --> 03:41.513
"I don't know what the market is
for the podgy, pale Australian guy

03:41.596 --> 03:45.058
who lasts a minute and a half,
but see what you can fuckin' get."

03:47.519 --> 03:51.189
Then she goes, "Well, I have a photo
of you doing cocaine."

03:52.023 --> 03:54.693
And I went, "Everyone does!

03:56.611 --> 04:00.782
I've done cocaine off photos
of me doing cocaine."

04:00.866 --> 04:02.617
[audience laughing]

04:03.201 --> 04:05.036
"And you want to extort me?

04:06.621 --> 04:08.915
Why don't you get a picture of me
being nice to my mother

04:08.999 --> 04:11.668
or opening a door for a woman
or something off-brand?"

04:13.587 --> 04:16.005
Now, I used to do
a lot of misogynistic jokes.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.966
I'm not going to do as many of those.

04:18.048 --> 04:19.050
I'll do some.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.762
[audience laughing and cheering]

04:22.846 --> 04:24.723
There's a lot of problems at the moment.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.851
There's a lot of guys
that are raping people,

04:27.934 --> 04:31.980
and a lot of people in the entertainment
business are going down,

04:32.063 --> 04:35.817
some for more offensive things
than others, you know, but...

04:37.027 --> 04:38.320
I'm nervous.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.613
You know, I...

04:41.364 --> 04:44.993
I don't think I've done anything wrong,
but between the hours of nine and nine,

04:45.076 --> 04:46.328
I'm pretty blacked out.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.496
Anyway, so...

04:50.707 --> 04:55.253
Like, if James Bond was a real person,
he'd be super fucking nervous right now.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.088
[audience laughing]

04:57.422 --> 05:01.009
James Bond would be showing up to work,
like, "I'm here to see Q."

05:01.092 --> 05:02.969
"Actually, you're here to see HR."

05:03.053 --> 05:04.763
[grumbles]

05:08.141 --> 05:11.978
"We have 472 complaints
from a Miss Moneypenny."

05:12.062 --> 05:13.605
Ah!

05:14.439 --> 05:18.360
"Two Russian operatives say you used their
power against them and had sex with them."

05:18.443 --> 05:21.655
"I was trying to get information.
You're welcome."

05:23.615 --> 05:25.951
There's been like, Kevin Spacey went down.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.079
Kevin Spacey, he went down, and he goes...

05:29.204 --> 05:30.997
He goes, his defense was,

05:31.081 --> 05:34.292
"It's probably a good time to mention
that I'm gay."

05:37.128 --> 05:39.673
And we were like, "What?

05:40.924 --> 05:43.218
Kevin, say it's not true."

05:43.552 --> 05:44.427
Um...

05:45.512 --> 05:48.098
Yeah, Kevin gets a bit grabby.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.976
[audience laughing]

05:51.685 --> 05:53.270
From all reports,

05:53.395 --> 05:56.565
he reaches,
he touches your dick outside your jeans.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.150
For a little bit. He's a dick grabber.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.865
We all have that gay friend, don't we?

06:06.950 --> 06:09.411
We all have that gay friend
that every time you're drunk,

06:09.536 --> 06:11.872
you're like, "Get out of of it,
don't touch my dick."

06:13.415 --> 06:15.041
And they're like,
"I'll get you next time,"

06:15.125 --> 06:17.127
I'm like, "I'm sure you will,
but not today."

06:20.130 --> 06:23.383
But he paid the price, as people should
when they do things wrong.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.885
He paid the price.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.304
You know, he had a great career,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.514
and Netflix,
the network we're on right now,

06:29.598 --> 06:31.600
they fired him, and rightfully so.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.268
And he lost his job

06:33.351 --> 06:34.811
as a fake president.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.188
[audience laughing]

06:38.899 --> 06:41.151
Yet there is an actual president...

06:42.235 --> 06:45.280
with four times as many allegations...

06:45.655 --> 06:47.824
who still has his fucking job.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.910
[audience cheering]

06:53.413 --> 06:54.706
We have a guy...

06:55.624 --> 06:57.083
who said, and I quote...

06:57.417 --> 06:58.668
"I love women...

06:59.210 --> 07:00.921
when I see them, I kiss them.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.798
I don't even ask.
I can't help myself.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.385
I grab 'em by the pussy.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.263
When you're famous...

07:10.805 --> 07:11.723
they let you."

07:15.518 --> 07:17.187
[audience laughing]

07:17.646 --> 07:19.147
Now, I'm famous.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.069
And when I heard that,
I went out and I gave it a go.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.239
And I gotta tell you, they don't let you!

07:29.199 --> 07:31.576
You women are a sensitive bunch.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.994
Moody, if you will.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.120
Now...

07:34.871 --> 07:36.873
[audience laughing]

07:37.540 --> 07:40.168
The term "Grab 'em by the pussy,"
as soon as that happened,

07:40.251 --> 07:43.463
I started tweeting and saying
in interviews jokes about it.

07:45.715 --> 07:49.177
And people started writing me saying,
"Yes, well, you've said worse things,"

07:49.260 --> 07:51.972
and I have, and this evening,
I will say worse things.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.184
And that's why I agree
that I shouldn't be president

07:56.267 --> 07:58.061
of the United States of America.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.854
[audience laughing and applauding]

08:00.355 --> 08:01.773
I'm not qualified.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.693
Don't use me as your moral benchmark.

08:06.027 --> 08:10.031
Do you think I'm offended
by the term "Grab 'em by the pussy"?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.242
I'm not offended by it.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.369
I'm confused as fuck.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.954
[audience laughing]

08:16.121 --> 08:20.083
I've never heard those words grouped
together into a fucking sentence.

08:23.712 --> 08:27.590
If he said, "I grab 'em by the tit,"
I know what a tit-grab entails.

08:28.758 --> 08:32.679
I can picture a tit-grab.
I'm fully aware of what's going on there.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.432
"I grab their ass," I know that.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.933
Even if it was weird,
like "I grab 'em by the head,"

08:38.018 --> 08:39.436
I can picture a head-grab.

08:43.313 --> 08:45.275
"Grab 'em by the pussy," you see...

08:45.859 --> 08:48.445
the pussy is an inward thing.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.655
[audience laughing]

08:50.947 --> 08:53.783
If I said to you right now, "I met a girl,

08:53.867 --> 08:57.037
I grabbed her by the belly button."
How fucking confused are you?

08:58.621 --> 09:01.124
You'd be like, "Did you poke it?"
I'd be like, "Nah...

09:01.207 --> 09:03.418
I didn't poke it.
I grabbed the whole thing.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.254
Keep up!"

09:06.629 --> 09:08.631
[audience laughing]

09:08.715 --> 09:10.592
Like, if he said, "I palm their pussy,"

09:10.675 --> 09:12.594
I can picture a pussy-palming.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.680
Like if he just scooped his hand over.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.811
Or if he fingered a pussy.
We've all fingered a pussy,

09:21.895 --> 09:23.897
whether it be our own or someone else's.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.776
But to grab a pussy...

09:28.610 --> 09:33.448
that's gotta be one fucking meaty,
low-hanging fruit fucking pussy.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.577
That's gotta be a pussy
that's just given birth,

09:37.660 --> 09:39.079
is prolapsed.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.623
They haven't put the stitches in yet.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.584
Maybe that's what he does.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.338
Maybe he goes around to maternity wards
and goes, "Congratulations!

09:49.631 --> 09:52.300
It's a beautiful child.
Don't worry about it. I'm famous."

09:52.550 --> 09:54.552
[audience laughing and cheering]

09:58.598 --> 10:01.893
This has taken up far too much space
in my brain.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.315
I've been thinking about pussy grabbing
for over a year now.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.654
Like, he says they don't mind.
What is the scenario...

10:13.613 --> 10:15.281
where you can grab a pussy...

10:16.032 --> 10:17.283
and no one minds?

10:18.827 --> 10:21.204
I guess it has to be in a private area,

10:21.287 --> 10:23.498
'cause you can't do it
in the general public,

10:23.581 --> 10:25.333
because for the most part

10:25.750 --> 10:28.086
pussy grabbing is "frowned upon."

10:30.713 --> 10:33.758
If I jumped into the crowd right now
and grabbed a pussy...

10:34.217 --> 10:36.886
you'd all be like, "Stop that, Jim."

10:37.220 --> 10:39.222
[audience laughing]

10:39.556 --> 10:42.183
"Get back on stage. Finish the show."

10:44.519 --> 10:48.523
So I've thought of every scenario,
I've thought of every available option

10:48.606 --> 10:50.942
on how to grab a pussy
where everything's fine.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.069
This is the only one
I can think of, right?

10:53.987 --> 10:57.115
Okay, the woman has to feel
comfortable and safe.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.743
So I picture a woman who's like,
she's in her own garden.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.246
[audience laughing]

11:03.538 --> 11:05.123
She's feeling good. It's her garden.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.418
She feels safe, it's a secluded garden.
There's fucking hedges and shit.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.589
She's wearing a mini-skirt, no underwear.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.300
She doesn't give a fuck. It's her garden.

11:17.719 --> 11:18.970
And she's gardening.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.972
She's tending to soil.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.099
[audience laughing]

11:23.224 --> 11:24.684
She's potting a plant.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.688
And then you, the celebrity...

11:29.606 --> 11:30.940
[audience laughing]

11:31.524 --> 11:35.486
You have to creep into the garden,
almost cartoonishly, just...

11:40.950 --> 11:45.496
Then you get your hand like that,
so devil horns open up, flip around.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.957
[audience laughing]

11:49.250 --> 11:51.794
Now you want to be
a real good pussy grabber,

11:51.878 --> 11:54.214
'cause you're only going to get
one shot at this.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.425
and that thumb's going
straight into the asshole.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.762
So you're like, "Bang!"

12:00.845 --> 12:03.973
Right, to begin with, she's shocked.
"What the fuck's going on?"

12:05.016 --> 12:08.978
While she's in that state of shock,
lift her up, she's on her toes.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.189
She's not going anywhere.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.691
She's upset, but then she turns around,

12:13.775 --> 12:16.486
"Oh, you're famous,"
and everything's fine.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.739
[audience laughing and cheering]

12:24.786 --> 12:27.705
Now, I don't want to spend
too much time talking about

12:27.789 --> 12:30.124
American politics while I'm here.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.752
You've got your own issues.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.212
[audience laughing]

12:34.504 --> 12:35.713
All right, look...

12:36.422 --> 12:39.259
I know you broke away
from the European Union.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.344
I don't understand what happened.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.263
I know it's mixed, the opinion.

12:44.555 --> 12:48.059
I don't know what's going on,
but then when I talk to you people,

12:48.142 --> 12:50.228
you don't fucking know
what's going on, either.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.940
I'm never seen something
happening in a country,

12:54.023 --> 12:56.567
where you're all like,
"No idea what's happening."

12:56.651 --> 12:57.986
[audience laughing]

12:58.820 --> 12:59.946
There's so many things.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.408
Like, do you get rid of
the European people who are living here?

13:03.491 --> 13:09.372
Or, like... in your hospitals,
you have 250,000 nurses

13:09.455 --> 13:13.376
who are from like Spain and France
and all that type of bullshit, right?

13:13.459 --> 13:15.169
Do you get rid of those people?

13:15.503 --> 13:19.882
And if you do do that,
do you get back all the British people...

13:20.425 --> 13:22.802
who live in Spain and France and all that?

13:23.428 --> 13:26.597
'Cause I gotta be honest,
they're not your best people.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.933
[audience laughing and applauding]

13:29.142 --> 13:31.144
Right? Like...

13:32.437 --> 13:35.982
you should have a TV show every night
called <i>One In, One Out.</i>

13:36.482 --> 13:38.484
[audience laughing]

13:39.736 --> 13:41.821
And it's like, "And who are we
getting rid of today?

13:41.904 --> 13:44.782
Okay, well, first of all,
we're getting rid of Rosita.

13:44.866 --> 13:48.369
Rosita is a nurse
who took care of the elderly,

13:48.453 --> 13:50.121
who incidentally voted her out.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.292
And..."

13:54.792 --> 13:56.794
[audience cheering]

13:58.713 --> 14:02.925
"And who are we getting back?
We're getting...

14:03.301 --> 14:04.927
Barry!"

14:05.011 --> 14:06.637
[audience laughing]

14:06.846 --> 14:11.351
"Barry's a cab driver who won ten grand
on a scratchy and moved to Majorca."

14:17.148 --> 14:19.067
Feels like a fair swap you got there.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.950
See, immigrants are good.
You wanna have them, man.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.996
Unless they're fucking Mexicans.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.247
[yells]

14:33.873 --> 14:38.086
I live in LA, you wouldn't believe
the problems we have with Mexicans.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.463
Fucking dirty Mexicans.

14:41.047 --> 14:44.133
They come over the border,
and they're taking all the good jobs.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.095
They can't even speak English,
they're taking all the good jobs.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.181
I don't know how they do it, but they do.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.766
[audience laughing]

14:51.849 --> 14:54.018
Sometimes I look at my son, and I think...

14:55.144 --> 14:57.271
"If only he could pick fruit someday."

14:57.605 --> 14:59.607
[audience laughing]

15:02.318 --> 15:05.863
I have this woman who cleans my house
twice a week.

15:06.531 --> 15:10.159
You wouldn't believe the amount
of white people who applied for that job.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.244
Oh!

15:11.994 --> 15:14.038
They were queued around the fucking block,

15:14.122 --> 15:16.624
and I was like, "Get the fuck away
from my house.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.420
I don't like explaining everything twice."
[yells]

15:20.503 --> 15:22.505
[audience laughing]

15:26.592 --> 15:27.510
[chuckles]

15:27.802 --> 15:31.013
This is what Trump reckons.
Trump reckons that the Mexicans...

15:31.806 --> 15:33.266
are coming over the border...

15:34.142 --> 15:35.184
and they're raping.

15:37.562 --> 15:38.980
I don't know how, though.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.691
It just doesn't feel like
the opportune time.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.693
[audience laughing]

15:46.404 --> 15:50.867
You're trying to flee a country,
you're dehydrated, you're in the desert.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.119
[audience laughing]

15:55.079 --> 15:56.664
That would be the last thing on my mind,

15:56.747 --> 15:59.959
but that's because I'm not
as sneaky as a Mexican.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.343
"They're coming over the border
and they're raping."

16:10.344 --> 16:11.971
Sure, maybe some of them.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.015
You know, maybe.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.601
But some of every nationality rapes.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.479
It's not like it's a Mexican thing.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.900
It's not like if you go to
a really authentic Mexican restaurant...

16:23.983 --> 16:25.234
[audience laughing]

16:26.736 --> 16:29.864
And there's like a fucking sombrero
and a piñata,

16:30.281 --> 16:32.116
and you walk in with your wife and kids,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.535
like, "This is very nice.
This is a lovely restaurant."

16:35.077 --> 16:37.121
Then, a waiter takes you away
from your family...

16:38.414 --> 16:40.416
[audience laughing]

16:41.959 --> 16:44.086
Off to the special Mexican closet.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.758
You come back out,
your ass is like a Japanese flag.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.260
[audience laughing]

16:54.430 --> 16:57.475
You look at your wife, and you're like,
"Why do we keep coming here?

16:59.227 --> 17:00.144
Every week.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.231
If the food wasn't so good..."

17:05.816 --> 17:07.484
It's not a Mexican thing.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.654
Sure, some of them are rapey.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.490
Every nationality rapes.
You have British rapists,

17:12.573 --> 17:14.116
you have Australian rapists,

17:14.200 --> 17:16.743
or Australia wouldn't exist
in its current state.

17:16.827 --> 17:17.662
There's...

17:17.744 --> 17:19.121
[audience laughing]

17:20.373 --> 17:23.084
There's probably a Canadian rapist,
one fella.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.256
Polite bloke.
You know, a nice bloke.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.343
Where you're going for a jog,
and he just drags you into some bushes,

17:32.426 --> 17:35.721
like, [imitating Canadian accent]
"I'm so sorry about this. I'm so sorry."

17:37.014 --> 17:40.935
I won't be too long.
I don't want to ruin your day."

17:41.018 --> 17:42.770
[audience laughing]

17:46.190 --> 17:49.193
That's why I do believe
there should be a wall.

17:49.652 --> 17:50.820
There should be a wall...

17:51.445 --> 17:52.905
on the Canadian border.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.740
[audience laughing]

17:55.825 --> 17:58.661
So that when the Americans
run out of health care,

17:58.744 --> 18:00.955
they can't crawl over into Canada.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.750
I think the Canadians
should just make the wall three foot high.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.961
[audience laughing]

18:08.421 --> 18:09.839
Just to take the piss.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.591
[audience laughing]

18:12.341 --> 18:14.427
So that when the Americans
are crawling over,

18:14.510 --> 18:18.014
because their lungs are filled with coal
from getting all their jobs back.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.057
[audience laughing]

18:23.519 --> 18:25.813
Like, who the fuck...

18:26.731 --> 18:29.817
wants their job back in the coal mine?

18:30.651 --> 18:31.902
Like, what the fuck is...

18:31.986 --> 18:34.780
They're like, "We're gonna get
our coal mining jobs back."

18:34.864 --> 18:38.075
What the fuck?
I didn't even know coal was still a thing.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.454
As soon as Trump said it,

18:41.537 --> 18:43.581
I'm like,
"Is this is a fucking Dickens novel?

18:43.664 --> 18:44.749
What the fuck?"

18:46.125 --> 18:48.502
And why the fuck do these people
deserve to have a job?

18:48.586 --> 18:50.087
What, because their dad had a job,

18:50.171 --> 18:52.173
and their grandfather had
the same fucking job,

18:52.256 --> 18:54.091
and their great-great grandpappy...

18:54.842 --> 18:58.679
Have some fucking dreams,
you low aspirational fuck.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.222
[audience laughing]

19:00.389 --> 19:02.558
And they say things,
they're just like this,

19:02.642 --> 19:06.312
like, "If the coal mine shuts down,
then the whole town will shut down."

19:06.395 --> 19:08.397
Yeah, fuck your town. Fuck it.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.483
[audience laughing]

19:11.150 --> 19:12.026
Fuck it.

19:12.443 --> 19:13.361
In my lifetime,

19:13.444 --> 19:16.614
the population of the world has gone
from three billion to seven billion,

19:16.697 --> 19:19.492
and no one wants to move
to your fucking town. Take a fucking hint.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.577
[audience laughing]

19:29.168 --> 19:30.878
No, it's good. No hecklers, happy.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.338
I don't like the hecklers.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.424
I was doing the Edinburgh Festival
in Scotland.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.885
I have to say Scotland,
'cause American people are watching.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.095
Um...

19:40.221 --> 19:42.098
I was doing the Edinburgh Festival
in Scotland,

19:42.181 --> 19:45.559
and I was performing
in front of about 400 people.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.145
I was doing a routine
I've done in one of my older specials

19:48.229 --> 19:49.814
that I don't do any more,

19:49.897 --> 19:52.525
about how you have to
baptize your children,

19:52.608 --> 19:54.819
because if you don't
baptize your children,

19:54.902 --> 19:57.822
and they die in infancy,
then they don't get into Heaven.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.574
Because God's a good guy...

20:01.033 --> 20:02.410
[audience laughing]

20:03.035 --> 20:05.287
but he does have some rules.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.209
And if he lets one dead baby
into Heaven,

20:10.292 --> 20:13.212
then he has to let
all the dead babies into Heaven.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.839
And before you know it,

20:14.922 --> 20:17.758
Heaven's just filled
with fucking dead babies.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.720
[audience laughing and cheering]

20:24.306 --> 20:27.017
So I'm on stage
kicking dead babies around,

20:27.101 --> 20:28.227
as you do at work.

20:30.521 --> 20:34.358
And this woman in the fourth row,
very attractive, but she's in hysterics.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.903
She's crying, her eyes are bawling,

20:37.987 --> 20:39.947
and she just stands up and goes...

20:40.030 --> 20:41.991
[imitating Scottish accent]
"You fucking bastard!

20:43.033 --> 20:44.869
You bastard!"

20:45.453 --> 20:47.913
And then she just leaves the room
just in hysterics.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.999
[screams]

20:51.041 --> 20:53.294
I'm still fucking mid-kick, like...

20:53.878 --> 20:55.880
[audience laughing]

21:00.050 --> 21:01.635
And then her husband stands up...

21:02.428 --> 21:04.472
and he picks up her handbag,

21:04.555 --> 21:07.600
and he holds the handbag
like all men hold handbags.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.603
Two hands in front of the chest.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.396
[audience laughing]

21:13.022 --> 21:15.357
"I'm holding this for someone else, so..."

21:16.484 --> 21:19.111
Anyways, he picks up the handbag,
he holds it,

21:19.195 --> 21:21.071
we can still hear her screaming.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.949
She went out the door, she's screaming.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.785
The staff are trying to calm her down.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.870
She's screaming,

21:27.953 --> 21:30.206
and the husband stands up, and he goes...

21:30.790 --> 21:32.041
"I'm sorry, Jim.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.375
I'm sorry, everyone.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.005
We were expecting our first child

21:38.547 --> 21:41.634
and she miscarriaged at seven months.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.428
That was six weeks ago

21:44.845 --> 21:46.472
and the baby was due this week.

21:46.847 --> 21:50.142
So we decided to leave the house
for the first time

21:50.601 --> 21:52.311
and forget about our problems..."

21:52.561 --> 21:54.563
[audience laughing]

21:54.939 --> 21:56.732
"And to try to have a laugh."

21:58.025 --> 22:00.027
[audience laughing]

22:05.491 --> 22:08.702
"Anyway, Jim, the first half of the show
was really great."

22:08.786 --> 22:10.788
[audience laughing]

22:11.831 --> 22:13.582
And then he just leaves awkwardly,

22:13.666 --> 22:16.544
like, "Excuse me. Sorry."

22:16.627 --> 22:18.462
We can still hear her screaming.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.717
Men and women in the room
are crying their eyes out,

22:23.801 --> 22:26.053
which isn't good for comedy, and...

22:27.137 --> 22:29.557
and I'm trying to bullshit
my way out of it.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.101
I'm on stage going, "Hey...

22:33.727 --> 22:36.814
that joke was more about
the hypocrisy of religion

22:36.897 --> 22:40.276
rather than dead babies, per se."

22:40.442 --> 22:41.277
Uh...

22:41.819 --> 22:43.821
[audience laughing]

22:45.614 --> 22:47.867
And as I'm doing that, in the second row

22:47.950 --> 22:51.495
a Geordie fellow from Newcastle, England,
he stands up in the second row,

22:51.579 --> 22:54.582
and he points at me,
really angry like this, and he goes...

22:55.332 --> 22:56.584
"To be fair...

22:57.835 --> 22:59.044
she's fucking hot."

22:59.503 --> 23:01.505
[audience laughing]

23:08.554 --> 23:11.265
And this sentence fell out
of my mouth so fast,

23:11.348 --> 23:13.225
I couldn't put the words back in.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.645
I went, "Ah, well,
they get to keep their figure

23:16.729 --> 23:18.856
when they don't carry them full-term."

23:19.356 --> 23:21.525
[audience groaning]

23:22.109 --> 23:23.360
I'm not proud of this.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.654
I'm just reporting it.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.700
As soon as I said it,

23:30.534 --> 23:33.078
bottles just started getting thrown at me.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.539
Just fucking... Whoof!

23:35.831 --> 23:39.126
I'm like, fucking from <i>The Matrix,</i> like...
[yells]

23:39.919 --> 23:41.670
And I was just like, "Good night!"

23:42.004 --> 23:43.547
[audience laughing]

23:47.259 --> 23:48.677
That was many years ago.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.264
If you're watching this special at home,
I hope you had a kid since then.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.515
Um...

23:57.603 --> 23:58.520
[chuckles]

23:58.646 --> 23:59.813
What am I gonna do?

24:00.522 --> 24:03.400
Her miscarriage brought so much joy
to other people.

24:03.525 --> 24:04.526
Uh...

24:06.278 --> 24:08.280
[audience laughs nervously]

24:16.538 --> 24:18.290
I dislike deaf people.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.585
[audience laughing]

24:23.504 --> 24:27.383
Actually, I need to rephrase that.
I don't dislike deaf people.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.969
I hate sign language people.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.639
Sign language people fuck me up the wall.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.766
I don't mind the deaf.

24:36.141 --> 24:39.770
Individually,
deaf people can be a delight.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.106
[audience laughing]

24:42.314 --> 24:44.775
It's when deaf people get into packs,

24:45.234 --> 24:46.360
I don't like them.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.029
If you get a group of deaf people...

24:49.113 --> 24:51.115
If you get eight or more deaf...

24:51.198 --> 24:52.157
like a herd of...

24:52.741 --> 24:53.742
A...

24:54.493 --> 24:55.869
A gaggle or a...

24:57.538 --> 24:59.289
What can we all agree on? A murder?

24:59.957 --> 25:01.208
[audience laughing]

25:01.542 --> 25:04.837
If you get a murder of deaf,
if you get eight or more deaf,

25:04.920 --> 25:06.338
and I have no problem with them.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.340
I just want to say that right again.

25:08.424 --> 25:12.136
If you get eight or more deaf,
and you're in a theater in America,

25:12.219 --> 25:17.099
they will be seated like this...
They'll be seated four and four, right?

25:17.182 --> 25:19.977
'Cause what happens is,
if you get a murder of deaf,

25:20.728 --> 25:25.274
the American government will pay
for a sign language person.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.860
Probably not for much longer,
but at the moment it's a thing.

25:27.985 --> 25:28.819
Uh...

25:28.902 --> 25:30.362
[audience laughing]

25:30.779 --> 25:34.491
The American government will pay for
a sign language person to stand here.

25:34.616 --> 25:38.328
Now, the sign language person is normally
a frumpy chick who learned sign language

25:38.412 --> 25:40.914
so she could date a deaf guy
out of her league, but whatever.

25:40.998 --> 25:41.874
Anyway...

25:41.957 --> 25:43.584
[audience laughing]

25:44.418 --> 25:45.252
So...

25:48.630 --> 25:50.674
But no one ever tells me.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.261
They never say,
"Jim, there's a sign language person."

25:54.344 --> 25:56.096
They never fucking tell me.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.349
So I come out,
"Please welcome Jim Jefferies,"

25:59.433 --> 26:01.560
I walk out,
I see the sign language person,

26:01.643 --> 26:03.228
I'm like, "Ah, fuck me."

26:04.021 --> 26:05.647
'Cause I've never had a good show

26:05.731 --> 26:07.566
if a sign language person
is standing there.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.901
Never fucking happened.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.487
Because the deaf people
are having a horrible time.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.615
They've watched me on Netflix,
they've read my lips,

26:14.698 --> 26:17.618
and they've had the subtitles,
and they've seen the facial expressions.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.244
Now they're not even looking at me.

26:19.661 --> 26:23.791
They're looking at her,
and her comedy timing fucking sucks dicks.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.292
[audience laughing]

26:26.251 --> 26:28.670
And they can't modulate their sound,

26:28.754 --> 26:30.964
so they're just like,
"This is a shit show,"

26:31.048 --> 26:32.382
and I'm like, "No!

26:33.550 --> 26:34.676
It's not a shit show!

26:34.760 --> 26:37.137
And she's like, "Not a shit show."
Like that.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.264
[audience laughing]

26:41.517 --> 26:43.185
Now I know what you're thinking.

26:44.144 --> 26:47.439
"What's the big deal?
That's eight people out of thousands.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.774
Who gives a fuck?"

26:49.024 --> 26:50.109
I'll tell you why.

26:50.192 --> 26:55.447
You can't have a good comedy show
with a sign language person,

26:55.531 --> 26:58.492
because the human brain
isn't fully developed.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.077
If I swear,

27:00.911 --> 27:03.497
and there's a sign language person
standing there,

27:03.580 --> 27:07.417
every single fucking one of you will go,
"And what would that word be?"

27:07.918 --> 27:09.920
[audience laughing]

27:13.423 --> 27:15.551
I do it myself while I'm onstage.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.262
[audience laughing]

27:18.929 --> 27:20.556
So I'll teach you the word you wanna know.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.559
"Cunt," obviously.
You wanna know "cunt."

27:24.143 --> 27:26.145
[audience cheering]

27:27.354 --> 27:29.648
All right, so that's "vagina."

27:32.025 --> 27:33.152
This is "cunt."

27:34.361 --> 27:36.280
[audience laughing]

27:38.323 --> 27:40.993
Gotta give it a bit of attitude,
it needs to be a snap.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.413
[audience laughing]

27:44.913 --> 27:48.709
You ever see deaf person
look at you like, "You cunt!" Like that.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.715
That's a deafie who don't like you.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.721
Then there's fun ones,
like "bullshit," right?

28:00.804 --> 28:02.097
So you do, like, a bull's head...

28:03.015 --> 28:04.892
Cross it around, bullshit.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.227
It's adorable. Bullshit.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.897
I always feel sorry for deaf people

28:09.980 --> 28:12.274
who are in relationships
with other deaf people.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.235
Because occasionally,
you must be fighting.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.447
You're coming home from a party.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.450
You're trying to be a safe driver.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.078
And your wife's being a fucking bitch...

28:26.079 --> 28:28.081
[audience laughing]

28:35.631 --> 28:37.633
[audience applauding]

28:39.885 --> 28:40.719
Bullshit.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.679
[audience laughing]

28:45.599 --> 28:46.600
And then...

28:46.683 --> 28:48.518
Then there's things that are just like...

28:48.602 --> 28:50.395
There's different dialects
for sign language.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.397
'Cause I've done this whole thing, right?

28:52.856 --> 28:53.982
So in Britain...

28:54.816 --> 28:55.943
this is "Jew."

28:57.486 --> 28:59.488
[audience laughing]

29:01.823 --> 29:02.991
Seems bad, right?

29:03.325 --> 29:04.910
Wait till you see America.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.122
This is "Jew" in America...

29:10.415 --> 29:12.417
[audience laughing]

29:13.752 --> 29:15.128
I don't know why,

29:15.212 --> 29:17.631
but that is more offensive than that.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.926
So if you ever see a deaf person,

29:21.009 --> 29:22.594
like, "You Jew cunt!"

29:22.761 --> 29:23.762
Like that.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.268
That's a Trump-voting deaf
you got yourself there.

29:29.351 --> 29:30.394
[audience laughing]

29:31.728 --> 29:34.398
Then there's things where you feel like
the deaf aren't educated.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.567
Like, this is "gay men."

29:39.528 --> 29:40.821
[audience laughing]

29:46.034 --> 29:48.328
That's what the deaf think
the gays get up to.

29:48.537 --> 29:50.539
[audience laughing]

29:51.581 --> 29:52.582
[chuckles]

29:53.166 --> 29:55.794
They think they get in a room
and bash dicks together.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.462
[audience laughing]

29:58.797 --> 30:02.843
Now, I was... doing that routine

30:02.926 --> 30:05.887
in New Zealand or something,
I was doing that,

30:06.513 --> 30:08.807
and a guy yelled out,
"Oh, that's docking."

30:11.143 --> 30:14.104
I said, "What's docking?"
And then he didn't say anything.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.774
And then I went home
and I googled "docking."

30:19.026 --> 30:20.986
And wasn't that a waste of four hours.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.280
[audience laughing]

30:27.326 --> 30:29.828
Just a show of hands.
Who knows what docking is?

30:31.121 --> 30:33.290
Wow, it's a lot.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.210
For the rest of you,
you're in for a treat.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.299
This is docking: You need two men...

30:43.925 --> 30:47.137
And both of them have to have
erect dicks at the same time.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.723
It's already weird, isn't it?

30:53.101 --> 30:54.603
Anyway, one dick...

30:55.020 --> 30:56.355
ideally, to dock...

30:59.733 --> 31:00.859
[chuckles]

31:03.445 --> 31:06.281
One dick needs to be,
like, a circumcised dick.

31:07.324 --> 31:10.369
And the other dick needs to be
a European fella.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.454
[audience laughing]

31:14.414 --> 31:16.166
Let's talk about this very quickly.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.211
Okay, so...

31:20.754 --> 31:21.963
I'm circumcised.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.965
I know you are all not circumcised.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.509
I know you're not, right?

31:27.052 --> 31:29.846
I got my son circumcised. Right?

31:29.971 --> 31:31.264
When I got my son circumcised,

31:31.348 --> 31:34.518
I mentioned on a late night show
that I got my son circumcised,

31:34.601 --> 31:38.605
and I got a lot of hate mail
and people freaking the fuck out

31:38.688 --> 31:42.109
and saying I mutilated my kid
and all this type of stuff, and...

31:42.192 --> 31:46.154
Look, people do it for different reasons.
It's a personal thing. Right?

31:46.238 --> 31:49.991
Some people circumcise their children
for religious purposes.

31:50.075 --> 31:53.537
Some people do it for medical reasons.

31:53.912 --> 31:59.000
The reason I got my son circumcised
is so that when he is older,

31:59.626 --> 32:02.003
women will enjoy having
his dick in their mouths.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.631
[audience laughing]

32:07.175 --> 32:10.053
I did it because I love him.

32:11.721 --> 32:14.975
And your dicks are fucking disgusting.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.352
You fucking animals.

32:17.436 --> 32:21.898
How do you fucking look at your dick
and have any level of self-respect?

32:23.108 --> 32:24.901
Every fucking day,

32:25.360 --> 32:28.572
your fucking hooded, slimy fucking dicks.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.657
[audience laughing]

32:31.450 --> 32:32.868
My dick smells constantly.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.996
It's an eternal battle against that smell.

32:36.079 --> 32:39.458
I can't even imagine
what you accept in your life.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.837
Do you know that it's not in porn?

32:44.254 --> 32:47.424
It's not in fucking porn.
Uncircumcised isn't in porn.

32:47.507 --> 32:50.135
Because the people that make porn
are trying to run a business,

32:50.218 --> 32:53.638
and they don't want people fucking
vomiting when they're masturbating.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.517
You can't go into a porn site
and put "uncircumcised."

32:57.601 --> 32:58.602
It doesn't come up.

32:58.935 --> 33:03.982
Your dick is less of a fetish than feet,
you fucking disgusting animals.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.568
[audience laughing]

33:07.944 --> 33:09.488
Name me one time

33:10.530 --> 33:13.241
where extra skin on the body
is a good thing.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.701
[audience laughing]

33:15.452 --> 33:17.871
When someone gets old,
they get that turkey neck

33:17.954 --> 33:20.582
and they're like,
"Ooh, I've been looking forward to this."

33:21.708 --> 33:25.754
Some fucking 500-pound cunt
loses 300 pounds,

33:25.837 --> 33:28.006
has a big elephant ear of skin,

33:28.089 --> 33:31.301
and the doctor goes, "Oh, lucky you!

33:32.552 --> 33:33.887
Extra skin.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.265
Women love extra skin."

33:37.390 --> 33:39.392
[audience laughing]

33:41.102 --> 33:43.730
Anyway, so docking,
you need two dicks, right?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.398
[audience laughing]

33:46.441 --> 33:48.610
A lovely, pristine dick, and...

33:49.569 --> 33:50.695
a horrible dick.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.197
[audience laughing]

33:52.531 --> 33:54.199
Then you line the two dicks up...

33:55.450 --> 33:57.285
and with your slimy hood...

33:59.621 --> 34:03.250
you get that bit,
and you stretch it over the nice dick.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.876
- Now...
- [audience groans]

34:05.126 --> 34:06.545
that'll make a seal.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.922
Now, the only way to break that seal

34:09.005 --> 34:11.841
is to pop a bit of air out of the side
and gently release,

34:11.925 --> 34:13.426
like it's a Tupperware lid.

34:13.510 --> 34:14.636
[audience laughing]

34:15.428 --> 34:17.304
'Cause you can't just pull against it,

34:17.389 --> 34:19.641
'cause then it's like
a Chinese finger trap.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.688
Now that the dicks are docked...

34:27.524 --> 34:30.402
you just gently bash dicks.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.071
[audience laughing]

34:35.282 --> 34:36.866
There's probably kissing, isn't there?

34:36.949 --> 34:39.869
I imagine you'd kiss.
Your mouths are aligned, probably...

34:41.746 --> 34:43.748
[audience laughing]

34:45.917 --> 34:48.085
And then if you're into each other,

34:48.168 --> 34:51.297
you'll come simultaneously
on each other's dick heads.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.341
[audience groans]

34:53.842 --> 34:56.469
That'll make a cum bubble of sorts...

34:59.347 --> 35:01.391
that eventually will just go, "Blugh."

35:01.474 --> 35:02.642
[audience laughing]

35:05.437 --> 35:06.479
And that's docking.

35:09.941 --> 35:10.984
[chuckles]

35:13.278 --> 35:15.238
Now, it's weird, because...

35:17.741 --> 35:21.036
People... I sort of got more popular,

35:21.119 --> 35:24.998
because of a routine that I did
on gun control, and...

35:25.081 --> 35:27.334
[audience cheering]

35:29.586 --> 35:32.047
People come and see me
because of the gun control routine,

35:32.130 --> 35:34.633
and they want me to do
some political commentary

35:34.716 --> 35:36.885
or some social commentary,

35:36.968 --> 35:39.846
and then I just did, like, what was that,
ten minutes on docking.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.973
[audience laughing]

35:42.932 --> 35:44.934
And the thing about
the gun thing is weird.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.270
It's nice to have that as a calling card,

35:47.354 --> 35:49.731
that people want to see you
because they liked that routine,

35:49.814 --> 35:52.359
but then also,
it's a double-edged sword because...

35:52.442 --> 35:56.196
I get more popular after a massacre,
and that's really not what you want.

35:57.364 --> 36:00.283
It's not like you're sitting at home,
"Ooh, there's been a massacre."

36:00.992 --> 36:02.077
Uh...

36:03.328 --> 36:08.500
It's tough, because people think
if you talk about gun control in America,

36:08.583 --> 36:10.168
you're talking about banning guns.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.753
I'm not talking about banning guns.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.339
I'm talking about controlling guns.

36:14.422 --> 36:17.467
See, after what happened in Las Vegas...

36:18.218 --> 36:20.387
That guy shot all those people.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.807
I think he had 48 guns
or something like that.

36:23.890 --> 36:27.644
All the news people were like,
"Gun control wouldn't have done anything,

36:27.727 --> 36:29.604
because he bought all the guns legally."

36:30.146 --> 36:31.398
And you're like, "Yeah...

36:32.232 --> 36:34.401
gun control could have
fucking solved that.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.989
How about if we brought in a law
where you're allowed seven?"

36:40.490 --> 36:42.242
[audience laughing]

36:43.034 --> 36:45.495
"If you can't protect
your family with seven,

36:45.578 --> 36:47.497
you're no fucking good with the guns."

36:47.580 --> 36:49.582
[audience laughing]

36:50.417 --> 36:53.169
So this whole idea
that if you bring in gun control,

36:53.294 --> 36:55.463
you're going to ban guns,
is a load of bullshit,

36:55.547 --> 36:57.257
because there already is gun control.

36:57.841 --> 37:02.554
There's things like you can't put
a bayonet on the end of your gun.

37:03.012 --> 37:05.098
'Cause that would make
your gun too stabby.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.183
[audience laughing]

37:07.851 --> 37:11.104
And it's the right to bear arms,
it's not the right to bear guns.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.981
It's the right to bear arms.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.607
Arms are weapons.

37:14.691 --> 37:16.067
See, in Texas,

37:16.151 --> 37:20.697
you can open carry an assault rifle
on your back into Target.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.325
You can't walk into Target

37:24.951 --> 37:26.161
with a chainsaw.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.831
People would think that's fucking weird.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.500
You walk into Target...

37:32.584 --> 37:33.710
[imitates a chainsaw]

37:35.211 --> 37:37.839
Security would be like,
"What the fuck with the chainsaw, man?"

37:37.922 --> 37:40.967
You'll be like,
"This is my protection chainsaw!

37:44.429 --> 37:46.681
This is to protect me and my family!

37:48.141 --> 37:49.392
You'll be happy I'm here

37:49.476 --> 37:51.603
if a bad guy with a chainsaw comes in.

37:52.562 --> 37:54.898
'Cause the only way to stop
a bad guy with a chainsaw

37:54.981 --> 37:57.025
is a good guy with a chainsaw."

37:57.609 --> 37:59.778
[audience laughing and cheering ]

37:59.861 --> 38:00.820
See...

38:03.198 --> 38:08.036
this idea that all guns are for protection
is fucking bullshit.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.621
They're not all for protection.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.374
You can buy sniper rifles.

38:15.001 --> 38:17.003
[audience laughing]

38:17.629 --> 38:19.881
Rifles that can shoot two kilometers.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.759
How is that for protection?

38:23.760 --> 38:24.886
Who the fuck...

38:26.012 --> 38:28.097
is sitting in the front of their house...

38:29.599 --> 38:31.601
[audience laughing]

38:31.935 --> 38:34.479
looking at some cunt
two kilometers away...

38:36.272 --> 38:37.982
like, "Back down!"

38:38.191 --> 38:39.651
[audience laughing]

38:44.280 --> 38:46.741
But you know, I understand.
People love their families.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.243
They wanna fucking...

38:48.535 --> 38:52.163
I'm actually gonna say something now
that'll make some people upset.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.790
It's weird that I say it.

38:53.915 --> 38:58.044
I'm a single dad now.
I've been a single dad for over a year.

38:58.127 --> 39:00.797
When people hear it,
they go, "Oh, that's a shame."

39:00.880 --> 39:04.050
Not a shame.
Me and my ex weren't getting along.

39:04.133 --> 39:08.012
We're still good friends now.
I'll tell you how we broke up.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.973
This is literally how me
and my ex broke up.

39:10.056 --> 39:14.561
I bought a house five doors down
from my house,

39:14.644 --> 39:16.396
and she goes, "What did you get that for?"

39:16.479 --> 39:18.189
And I went, "For you to live in."

39:18.606 --> 39:20.233
[audience laughing]

39:24.320 --> 39:27.448
And she high-fived me
and skipped down there.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.075
She was happy to go as well.

39:30.451 --> 39:31.619
So now I'm a single dad,

39:31.703 --> 39:34.289
and the weird thing is about being
a single dad is, before that,

39:34.372 --> 39:38.084
I used to go on and on and on
about what a great parent I was.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.629
But I wasn't a great parent.
I wasn't.

39:42.547 --> 39:45.675
I was just a guy
who lived with a four-year-old.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.178
This is how I used to parent.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.847
I used to walk around the house,

39:50.930 --> 39:53.266
I saw my son playing with a toy,
I would be like,

39:53.349 --> 39:54.767
"What are you playing with there?

39:56.227 --> 39:57.061
Lego!

39:58.229 --> 39:59.480
Sounds fun. All right."

39:59.856 --> 40:01.858
[audience laughing]

40:02.692 --> 40:04.485
And then his mum would take him to bed,

40:04.569 --> 40:07.822
and I'd go,
"Good night, sweet dreams, my prince!"

40:08.948 --> 40:10.199
I was a shit parent.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.785
Well, now it's just me and him.

40:13.536 --> 40:17.832
And so I have this four-year-old
that comes once a... every...

40:18.124 --> 40:20.126
Every second week, I get my kid.

40:20.209 --> 40:23.796
He comes over, I try to make it
as normal a family life as we can,

40:23.880 --> 40:26.591
but the little cunt
only eats four different foods.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.426
[audience laughing]

40:28.509 --> 40:32.388
He eats macaroni and cheese,
chicken and fucking pizza and apples.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.143
I try to make him eat other things,
but his mother doesn't.

40:37.226 --> 40:39.771
It's a big argument, that's why
she lives in another fucking house.

40:39.854 --> 40:40.730
Anyway...

40:43.650 --> 40:47.278
But he comes over and I try to have
family meals with him, right?

40:47.362 --> 40:48.696
So it's just me and him

40:48.780 --> 40:50.990
so I make him chicken,
I have to bread it,

40:51.074 --> 40:54.035
I have to do things,
I have to make it a certain level,

40:54.118 --> 40:56.829
and then I cut up some apples,
and then I sit there,

40:56.913 --> 40:58.581
and then he comes
and eats dinner with me.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.375
And I'm not gonna make
two fucking meals,

41:00.458 --> 41:03.086
so I'm eating fucking chicken
and apples as well.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.380
[audience laughing]

41:07.340 --> 41:09.384
So we're sitting there eating a meal,

41:09.467 --> 41:11.719
and I don't let him watch TV
while we're eating.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.763
That's family time, so it's me and him.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.516
But I got to be honest,
I want to watch the TV.

41:18.017 --> 41:21.437
The conversation runs out
pretty fucking quick.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.940
He hasn't got a lot going on.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.776
I go to him, "How was your day?"

41:26.859 --> 41:29.445
And he goes, "I don't know,"
and I go, "What did you do at school?"

41:29.529 --> 41:32.240
He goes, "Drew a picture,"
and I'm like, "Fuck, this is a long meal."

41:32.323 --> 41:34.325
[audience laughing]

41:36.411 --> 41:39.414
Anyway, so I make him the chicken,
I make him the apples,

41:39.497 --> 41:42.625
and then I take him upstairs
for bedtime at 8:30,

41:42.750 --> 41:46.921
and he has a bath and I wash his hair
and I put him in some pajamas,

41:47.005 --> 41:48.464
and he's all fresh and clean.

41:48.548 --> 41:51.592
I put him in the bed,
I sing him the same song every day.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.887
And then I read him a story
and I wait till he falls asleep

41:55.555 --> 41:57.557
and then I go downstairs and watch TV.

41:58.141 --> 42:00.768
And then about two hours later,
about 10:30,

42:00.852 --> 42:02.061
I just hear screaming, just...

42:02.145 --> 42:04.981
[screams]

42:05.064 --> 42:08.234
I run up the fucking stairs,
I get up there, he's covered in vomit.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.529
He's vomited all over.
He's got vomit through his fucking hair.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.740
I pick him up, he's shitting.

42:13.823 --> 42:16.743
Right, he's shitting and vomiting onto me.

42:16.826 --> 42:18.077
So he's vomiting onto me,

42:18.161 --> 42:19.996
but he's shitting
in front of where I'm walking.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.664
So I'm walking through shit

42:22.331 --> 42:23.875
as vomit's coming onto me.

42:24.834 --> 42:27.879
I put him on the toilet.
I get him a bucket.

42:28.004 --> 42:31.215
He is now shitting
and vomiting simultaneously.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.216
Now,

42:32.300 --> 42:35.011
maybe I didn't cook
that chicken long enough.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.971
[audience laughing]

42:38.514 --> 42:39.348
Anyway...

42:41.726 --> 42:45.605
So he's just sitting there.
He's never had food poisoning before.

42:45.688 --> 42:46.814
I had the same meal.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.901
The little cunt's just got
a weak constitution. Anyway, so...

42:51.736 --> 42:55.531
He's sitting there shitting and vomiting
at the same time.

42:55.615 --> 42:58.284
The poor little fella, 'cause he's four,

42:58.367 --> 43:01.829
his brain doesn't compute
that this won't go on forever.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.208
He actually looked at me,
shitting and vomiting,

43:05.291 --> 43:07.877
he looks at me and goes,
"I guess this is me now."

43:08.252 --> 43:10.254
[audience laughing]

43:12.924 --> 43:15.343
I'm just laughing like,
"You'll be all right, fella.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.844
You'll be all right."

43:20.306 --> 43:22.767
Anyway, this goes on for a couple hours,

43:22.850 --> 43:24.435
where it's about midnight now.

43:24.519 --> 43:27.814
He's empty.
Everything's out of his body.

43:28.231 --> 43:30.483
I give him another bath,
and I wash him off,

43:30.566 --> 43:32.902
and I wash all the vomit
out of his hair,

43:32.985 --> 43:34.779
and I put him in some new pajamas,

43:34.862 --> 43:39.158
and I say, "Come sleep in my bed, mate.
Everything's going to be all right."

43:39.408 --> 43:42.870
And he sleeps in my bed,
and I pat his back until he goes to sleep.

43:43.412 --> 43:44.831
And then I go to sleep.

43:45.248 --> 43:46.707
And then two hours later,

43:47.041 --> 43:48.084
I shit the bed.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.002
[audience laughing]

43:51.546 --> 43:52.421
Now...

43:53.840 --> 43:55.091
this wasn't like...

43:55.716 --> 43:59.011
like I woke up with cramps and went...
[groans]

43:59.095 --> 44:00.346
And then I shit the bed.

44:00.429 --> 44:03.349
No, the shit and the waking up
was a simultaneous thing.

44:04.642 --> 44:05.893
I was lying there, and went...

44:05.977 --> 44:08.146
[makes a splat sound]
[groans]

44:10.106 --> 44:11.023
He's fast asleep,

44:11.107 --> 44:13.568
and I just shit the bed
next to a four-year-old.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.863
Which I assume is a crime.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.700
I've never felt so sick, and I get out,

44:20.783 --> 44:24.120
and I'm in my underwear,
there's just shit pouring down my thighs,

44:24.203 --> 44:25.163
and I'm like...

44:25.246 --> 44:26.539
[screams]

44:26.998 --> 44:30.001
And I vomit on the floor,
and I'm walking through my own vomit,

44:30.084 --> 44:32.003
and I'm shitting onto the vomit,

44:32.086 --> 44:34.297
and I make it all the way to my toilet...

44:35.047 --> 44:37.008
and I sit there and I'm shitting...

44:37.091 --> 44:38.259
I didn't have a bucket,

44:38.342 --> 44:42.054
so I'm just vomiting
into the fucking bathtub,

44:42.138 --> 44:43.222
and shitting,

44:43.306 --> 44:44.849
and I actually said out loud,

44:45.099 --> 44:47.018
"I guess this is me now!"

44:47.101 --> 44:48.477
[audience laughing]

44:49.437 --> 44:52.607
[audience cheering]

44:55.443 --> 44:57.778
Now, I'm there for a couple of hours.

44:58.738 --> 45:02.450
I've taken all my clothes off,
so now it's, like, five in the morning...

45:03.117 --> 45:05.995
and I'm fucking naked,
just still shitting and vomiting.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.956
And my son wakes up.

45:10.750 --> 45:12.418
He's feeling fresh as a daisy.

45:13.294 --> 45:14.378
[audience laughing]

45:14.629 --> 45:18.549
He comes in, his pajamas all clean,
his hair's all fluffy, he walks in.

45:18.633 --> 45:19.467
Holding his teddy,

45:19.550 --> 45:21.886
he walks around the pile
of shit and vomit.

45:21.969 --> 45:23.971
[audience laughing]

45:25.139 --> 45:28.768
He walks in to see his father
shitting and vomiting on the toilet.

45:28.851 --> 45:31.896
He looks at me and goes,
"We had a tough night, didn't we, Dad?"

45:31.979 --> 45:33.981
[audience laughing]

45:34.315 --> 45:36.317
[audience cheering]

45:40.613 --> 45:41.447
Now...

45:45.451 --> 45:46.535
I'm gonna tell you a story.

45:47.036 --> 45:49.622
Now, this story happened...

45:49.747 --> 45:50.665
uh...

45:51.624 --> 45:53.042
about a year and a half ago.

45:53.542 --> 45:55.461
I got booked to do a private party

45:56.170 --> 45:57.713
with a very famous...

45:59.465 --> 46:00.591
American singer.

46:01.217 --> 46:05.596
And I signed a contract to say
that I would never say who booked me,

46:05.680 --> 46:08.599
how much I was paid,
or who was at the party.

46:09.475 --> 46:13.437
But then I've just been telling people,
and nothing's happened, so...

46:14.105 --> 46:15.314
[audience laughing]

46:16.941 --> 46:19.944
So it's... Mariah Carey. Now...

46:21.612 --> 46:24.448
I get a phone call
from her management one day,

46:24.532 --> 46:27.660
and they say,
"Mariah Carey's a massive fan of yours."

46:28.119 --> 46:29.870
And I said, "No, she's not."

46:30.746 --> 46:31.872
They go, "How do you know?"

46:31.956 --> 46:34.792
I said, "I don't know the woman.
I've never met her.

46:35.042 --> 46:37.628
But I know this. There is no scenario

46:37.878 --> 46:40.631
where Mariah Carey finishes a concert,

46:40.715 --> 46:43.884
goes home, pours herself a bath,
lights a few candles,

46:43.968 --> 46:45.928
and goes, 'Put on a bit of Jim Jefferies.'

46:46.637 --> 46:49.807
And then sits there splashing around,
going, 'Women <i>are </i> cunts!'

46:49.890 --> 46:50.766
No."

46:51.434 --> 46:52.727
[audience laughing]

46:53.936 --> 46:55.396
I said, "She's not a fan."

46:58.941 --> 47:02.445
So they ring back and they go...
Her fiance at the time...

47:02.528 --> 47:04.655
"Her fiance, James Packer, is a fan."

47:04.739 --> 47:08.367
Now, James Packer is a very famous
Australian billionaire.

47:09.118 --> 47:13.539
And she wanted to purchase me
for his 50th birthday

47:13.622 --> 47:15.499
as a gift, right?

47:16.375 --> 47:20.338
Already weird, to be a human gift.

47:20.421 --> 47:21.839
[audience laughing]

47:22.048 --> 47:24.008
But I guess that's
what you buy billionaires.

47:24.091 --> 47:25.801
You can't buy them materialistic things,

47:25.885 --> 47:28.054
'cause they can purchase
whatever they want.

47:28.137 --> 47:30.598
You buy them
other human beings doing tricks.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.933
[audience laughing]

47:35.311 --> 47:37.313
So they ring me up, and they go...

47:37.980 --> 47:43.069
They go, "$15,000, 15 minutes.
You just gotta perform at a dinner party.

47:43.152 --> 47:46.489
She lives half a mile away from you.
Easy-peasy.

47:47.239 --> 47:48.616
And I said to my manager, Alex,

47:48.699 --> 47:51.369
I said, "Alex, that sounds
fucking horrible.

47:52.119 --> 47:53.496
I'm not gonna do that."

47:53.579 --> 47:55.790
And he rings back up ten minutes later,

47:55.873 --> 47:57.375
"$30,000...

47:58.584 --> 47:59.794
15 minutes."

48:00.419 --> 48:01.587
And I said, "Alex...

48:02.922 --> 48:04.006
I'm an artist."

48:04.590 --> 48:06.592
[audience laughing]

48:06.842 --> 48:09.595
"I never let money make decisions for me."

48:10.638 --> 48:12.848
Now, I think we all know
where this is headed.

48:12.932 --> 48:14.934
[audience laughing]

48:17.436 --> 48:20.606
They rang back, "$60,000, 12 minutes,"

48:20.689 --> 48:22.608
and I was like,
"Fuck it, what's your address?"

48:22.691 --> 48:23.943
[audience laughing]

48:25.528 --> 48:26.487
So three weeks later...

48:26.570 --> 48:29.657
So for three weeks
I was just dreading this gig,

48:29.740 --> 48:32.993
and then three weeks later, it's like,
all right, I show up at the house.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.538
I'm there in the middle of summer.

48:35.621 --> 48:37.623
I'm wearing a leather jacket
and fucking T-shirt,

48:37.706 --> 48:39.125
I'm sweating my ass off,

48:39.208 --> 48:40.918
and I'm there with my manager, Alex,

48:41.001 --> 48:44.588
and someone...
Mariah's assistant opens the door,

48:44.713 --> 48:46.966
and goes,
"Which one of you is Jim Jefferies?"

48:47.049 --> 48:48.759
- I'm like...
- [audience laughing]

48:49.343 --> 48:51.554
The fucking career is crushing it,
obviously.

48:51.637 --> 48:52.513
Uh...

48:53.722 --> 48:56.183
I said, "That's me," and she goes,
"We've been waiting for you,"

48:56.267 --> 48:58.853
and she goes, "You're not to be seen.
You're a surprise."

48:59.645 --> 49:02.314
And I get into the house, she's like,
"Oh! Take your shoes off!"

49:02.690 --> 49:04.108
Mariah's one of those cunts.

49:08.529 --> 49:10.030
Soon as you enter your house,

49:10.114 --> 49:12.867
you gotta feel uncomfortable,
take your fucking shoes off.

49:13.117 --> 49:16.787
I don't know if we have any of those
Nazi fucking pricks in this room,

49:16.871 --> 49:18.873
but you've lost
a lot of friends over this,

49:18.956 --> 49:20.749
you fucking lowlife cunts.

49:20.833 --> 49:22.126
[audience cheering]

49:22.293 --> 49:23.127
Anyway...

49:25.337 --> 49:26.839
So I take my shoes off.

49:26.922 --> 49:29.467
I'm the birthday surprise,
so no one's to see me,

49:29.550 --> 49:31.677
so they secretly get me into the kitchen.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.095
So I go into the kitchen.

49:33.179 --> 49:36.223
I'm sitting there, and then they give me
some rich people food,

49:36.307 --> 49:39.393
which is the same as poor people food
but has truffles on it.

49:39.477 --> 49:40.978
[audience laughing]

49:41.312 --> 49:43.981
I'm sitting there eating
my fucking truffley food...

49:44.940 --> 49:45.983
[chuckles]

49:46.609 --> 49:50.446
I look at my manager, like, "I shouldn't
be here. It's the worst idea I ever had."

49:50.529 --> 49:53.199
- I shouldn't do this."
- He's like, "It's going to be fine.

49:53.282 --> 49:54.700
It'll be great. You'll do great."

49:54.783 --> 49:57.786
At that stage,
Eddie Murphy walks into the kitchen.

49:59.872 --> 50:02.249
Now, Eddie Murphy,
and I want this on film,

50:02.333 --> 50:04.293
is my childhood fucking hero.

50:04.376 --> 50:06.795
<i>Delirious </i> was such a big deal to me.

50:06.879 --> 50:08.380
[audience cheering]

50:08.547 --> 50:13.302
And was the reason
that I tell these big long stories.

50:13.385 --> 50:15.971
He was the first comic I saw
who told long stories.

50:16.347 --> 50:18.349
Anyway, I'm gonna do
a terrible impersonation,

50:18.432 --> 50:21.477
but Eddie Murphy walks up
to one of the catering people,

50:21.560 --> 50:23.979
he goes, "I'm all dehydrated.

50:25.147 --> 50:28.067
I need a Gatorade or a Powerade
or something with 'ade.'

50:29.443 --> 50:31.737
I need electrolytes. My mouth is dry."

50:31.904 --> 50:33.906
[audience laughing]

50:34.865 --> 50:36.325
And I'm just staring at him, like...

50:39.411 --> 50:42.039
Then he points at me, he goes,
"Oh, I know you.

50:42.122 --> 50:44.625
You do the TV show with the disabled boy."

50:44.708 --> 50:48.170
And I said, "I <i>do </i> do the TV show
with the disabled boy!"

50:48.629 --> 50:50.923
And he goes, "I love that show.
It's a fantastic show.

50:51.006 --> 50:54.301
You're masturbating off a little disabled
boy in the sky. What a great show it was.

50:54.927 --> 50:56.095
What are you doing here?"

50:56.345 --> 50:59.223
And I said, "I'm gonna do stand-up
for the dinner party!"

50:59.306 --> 51:02.434
And he went, "There's no way that's
gonna work out," and he just fucked off.

51:03.519 --> 51:04.937
[audience laughing]

51:05.020 --> 51:05.896
[clears throat]

51:08.107 --> 51:11.944
So I just break out
into a fucking sweat, right?

51:12.403 --> 51:14.697
And then Mariah's assistant
comes up to me,

51:14.780 --> 51:16.156
and she goes, "It's time."

51:16.490 --> 51:18.033
Now, let me paint a picture for you.

51:19.952 --> 51:22.788
There's 20 people in a garden,
sitting at a long table,

51:22.871 --> 51:24.373
surrounded by tiki torches

51:24.456 --> 51:26.875
before tiki torches had
racist connotations.

51:28.919 --> 51:30.337
They're all famous people.

51:30.421 --> 51:33.549
They do not know
that there's any entertainment.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.177
Nor have I been announced.

51:38.721 --> 51:40.389
There is not a microphone.

51:41.432 --> 51:42.808
There is not a light.

51:44.685 --> 51:46.729
I'm walking out in my socks.

51:46.979 --> 51:48.981
[audience laughing]

51:50.024 --> 51:53.402
I just look like a guy
who's gotten onto the property...

51:53.485 --> 51:55.404
[audience laughing]

51:56.113 --> 51:59.074
And has a few things
that he wants to say.

51:59.158 --> 52:01.160
[audience laughing]

52:03.120 --> 52:05.914
See, the difference
between stand-up comedy

52:05.998 --> 52:07.499
and a drunk guy giving opinions?

52:09.126 --> 52:10.669
That's it.

52:10.753 --> 52:12.171
[audience laughing]

52:12.713 --> 52:15.466
So I walk out, and so,

52:15.549 --> 52:19.053
Mariah Carey's here, James Packer's here,
Eddie Murphy's here.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.388
Al Pacino's here, Warren Beatty's here,

52:21.472 --> 52:23.432
and it gets less and less
famous as we go along.

52:23.515 --> 52:25.059
[audience laughing]

52:25.517 --> 52:28.103
So I walk out, I've never done
a birthday party before,

52:28.187 --> 52:30.064
so I just treat it
like a kid's birthday party.

52:30.147 --> 52:34.151
So I walk up to a 50-year-old man,
and I go, "Hey, hey!"

52:34.610 --> 52:35.944
[audience laughing]

52:36.320 --> 52:37.988
"Happy birthday!"

52:39.615 --> 52:41.533
And he went, "Who are you?"

52:41.617 --> 52:43.786
And I went, "Who am I?

52:44.912 --> 52:47.331
I'm Jim Jefferies,
your favorite comedian!"

52:48.957 --> 52:51.293
And he goes, "I don't know you."

52:52.336 --> 52:55.297
And I pointed at Mariah,
and I said, "Mariah!"

52:55.839 --> 52:58.801
And Mariah's on her seventh Xanax
of the fucking day.

52:59.426 --> 53:01.011
[audience laughing]

53:01.345 --> 53:03.597
And she just looks over at him and goes,

53:03.681 --> 53:07.726
"Remember? We watched him
on the computer doing something."

53:08.727 --> 53:12.314
It was very clear that they were towards
the end of their relationship,

53:12.398 --> 53:15.693
because he was just like,
"Why do you talk?"

53:16.402 --> 53:18.404
[audience laughing]

53:21.573 --> 53:23.075
And I went, "Fuck it!

53:23.951 --> 53:26.370
I'll tell some jokes anyway, shall I?"

53:26.453 --> 53:27.788
[audience laughing]

53:28.247 --> 53:29.665
At that stage,

53:29.790 --> 53:33.377
Leonardo DiCaprio walks in
with three of the hottest chicks

53:33.460 --> 53:35.838
I've ever seen in my fucking life.

53:35.921 --> 53:37.965
He has it big,
'cause he just did that movie

53:38.048 --> 53:40.259
where he had sex with a bear.
I haven't seen it.

53:41.844 --> 53:44.054
He walks up. He stands next to me.

53:44.388 --> 53:47.599
Everyone greets him
like he's Norm from <i>Cheers,</i> right?

53:48.100 --> 53:50.936
Somehow, this cunt gets
to keep his shoes on.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.522
[audience laughing]

53:57.443 --> 54:00.362
And he just chats to the table
for three minutes.

54:01.029 --> 54:02.030
So for three minutes,

54:02.114 --> 54:04.324
I'm standing
next to Leonardo DiCaprio like this...

54:05.075 --> 54:07.077
[audience laughing]

54:10.748 --> 54:12.666
After three minutes,
he doesn't even look at me.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.419
He just points at me and goes,
"What's all this about?"

54:16.837 --> 54:19.465
And Warren Beatty went, "We don't know!"

54:19.590 --> 54:21.592
[audience laughing]

54:23.177 --> 54:26.346
Then Leonardo DiCaprio
took the women over,

54:26.430 --> 54:28.140
and sat on some garden furniture,

54:28.223 --> 54:30.601
and I was like,
"Fuck it, I'll just go do 12 minutes.

54:30.684 --> 54:34.146
No one says anyone has to laugh,
I just gotta fucking talk, right?"

54:34.229 --> 54:36.857
So I just started phoning in
some fucking jokes.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.985
I just looked at them and went,
"There's a turtle at my kid's school,"

54:40.068 --> 54:41.653
and I told the turtle routine,

54:41.737 --> 54:46.033
and I'm just fucking walking around
telling the fucking turtle routine.

54:46.700 --> 54:49.369
James Packer is getting angrier
and angrier, just like...

54:49.912 --> 54:51.038
"Fucking..."

54:51.413 --> 54:53.874
At one stage, he says to Mariah Carey

54:53.957 --> 54:56.794
at the same volume
that I'm talking next to him,

54:56.877 --> 54:59.797
he says, "Why did you think
I'd enjoy this?"

55:00.297 --> 55:01.256
Right?

55:03.550 --> 55:06.261
And I'm like, "Just keep smiling, Jim.

55:07.805 --> 55:10.390
Keep a song in your heart,
and they can't hurt you."

55:10.474 --> 55:12.476
[audience laughing]

55:15.521 --> 55:18.690
So I keep going,
and he's getting angrier and angrier,

55:19.107 --> 55:20.734
and he just goes like this...

55:28.534 --> 55:29.660
"Gun control!"

55:29.785 --> 55:31.245
And I said, "Yes!"

55:31.370 --> 55:33.372
[audience laughing]

55:33.622 --> 55:36.083
"I'm the gun control guy!"

55:36.166 --> 55:37.876
And he goes, "I love that bit.

55:39.628 --> 55:40.671
Do that bit."

55:40.754 --> 55:42.756
[audience laughing]

55:43.215 --> 55:45.425
And I said, "I haven't performed that
in over a year.

55:45.509 --> 55:47.135
I really don't know how it goes,"

55:47.219 --> 55:48.887
and he went, "Just fucking do it."

55:50.430 --> 55:51.849
And I went, "Okay!"

55:52.641 --> 55:54.643
So I started doing the gun control thing.

55:54.726 --> 55:57.980
So I'm like running across the lawn
to do the fucking safe thing.

55:58.063 --> 56:00.482
Now, that routine...

56:01.149 --> 56:03.068
is 16-and-a-half minutes long.

56:03.277 --> 56:04.778
[audience laughing]

56:05.112 --> 56:07.030
I go through it in eight minutes.

56:08.615 --> 56:11.285
'Cause it turns out,
it's shorter without laughter.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.453
[audience laughing]

56:13.537 --> 56:16.373
[audience cheering]

56:24.631 --> 56:26.466
I did get a laugh, though.

56:26.550 --> 56:28.802
I got a laugh from James Packer.

56:29.303 --> 56:32.139
At the halfway moment during the routine,

56:32.222 --> 56:36.560
he just gave this,
like, Australian billionaire...

56:37.102 --> 56:39.563
guttural fucking laugh.

56:39.646 --> 56:40.939
He just went, "Ha!"

56:41.273 --> 56:42.816
[audience laughing]

56:43.442 --> 56:46.737
This laugh is so distinctive
to my Australian ear,

56:46.820 --> 56:49.907
that if I was in the Outback,
and I heard it,

56:50.616 --> 56:51.992
I would become like Steve Irwin,

56:52.075 --> 56:54.953
and be like,
"Oh! That's the Australian billionaire."

56:55.037 --> 56:56.997
[audience laughing]

56:58.749 --> 57:01.251
And then he just went...
[guffaws]

57:02.127 --> 57:05.547
Because it was his birthday,
it was like a moment in a medieval film

57:05.672 --> 57:07.257
where the king started laughing,

57:07.382 --> 57:11.178
and the rest of the courtyard was like,
"The King is amused!"

57:12.387 --> 57:14.765
They all started laughing a little bit,

57:14.848 --> 57:17.601
and all of a sudden,
I wasn't having a good gig,

57:17.684 --> 57:19.227
but I was getting away with it.

57:19.311 --> 57:20.604
[audience laughing]

57:22.314 --> 57:25.442
So I finish up the show and I did
a routine that was on my last special

57:25.525 --> 57:28.236
about how I'm a five
in the looks department,

57:28.612 --> 57:31.365
but because I'm on TV
I get to fuck sixes and sevens,

57:32.115 --> 57:34.743
but because I'm an alcoholic,
I fuck fours and threes.

57:34.993 --> 57:36.995
[audience laughing]

57:39.414 --> 57:42.584
So I did that routine, then afterwards,
I'm standing around with my manager, Alex,

57:42.668 --> 57:44.086
and we're drinking,

57:44.169 --> 57:46.838
and Al Pacino and Warren Beatty
walk up to us

57:46.922 --> 57:49.174
and they're drunk as fuck, or...

57:49.716 --> 57:50.842
they're just old.

57:51.051 --> 57:52.844
[audience laughing]

57:54.388 --> 57:57.015
And Al Pacino walks up to me,

57:57.099 --> 57:59.977
and this is the exact words
he says, he went, "Oh!

58:01.603 --> 58:04.147
A couple of fives
are talking to each other."

58:04.898 --> 58:06.900
[audience laughing]

58:09.236 --> 58:11.613
And I forgot my routine,
I'm like, "Sorry?"

58:12.280 --> 58:13.991
And he goes, "I'm a five.

58:14.825 --> 58:16.660
You're also a five."

58:16.785 --> 58:18.578
[audience laughing]

58:19.246 --> 58:22.582
Then I remembered, I went,
"Well, I get to fuck sixes and sevens

58:22.666 --> 58:24.334
because I'm on the TV.

58:24.418 --> 58:27.087
I bet you're fucking crazy nines
and tens, right?"

58:27.170 --> 58:29.047
And he grabs one of the girls with Leo,

58:29.131 --> 58:31.425
and he drags her,
and he goes, "You're right."

58:31.591 --> 58:33.593
[audience laughing]

58:34.011 --> 58:35.721
Then he pushed her away,

58:35.804 --> 58:39.016
and then Harvey Weinstein tackled her
and dragged her into the bushes.

58:39.099 --> 58:41.101
[audience laughing and applauding]

58:44.813 --> 58:47.899
And then he goes like this,
he goes, "I like what you do.

58:49.359 --> 58:50.777
You tell stories.

58:51.903 --> 58:54.740
Nobody tells stories anymore."

58:55.490 --> 58:57.492
[audience laughing]

58:58.702 --> 59:01.329
"You tell a story, I'm enjoying myself.

59:01.413 --> 59:03.248
Oh, I'm enjoying myself.

59:04.207 --> 59:07.085
But then you get distracted
and go on a tangent,

59:07.169 --> 59:08.503
and I think, 'Oh, no...

59:10.422 --> 59:12.257
I'll never hear the end of this tale.'"

59:12.340 --> 59:13.800
[audience laughing]

59:14.384 --> 59:18.472
But then you come back to the story,
"and I'm like, 'Wow!

59:19.347 --> 59:21.099
He remembered the whole time.'"

59:21.349 --> 59:23.351
[audience laughing]

59:24.019 --> 59:26.021
[audience cheering]

59:28.148 --> 59:31.234
And then he kept talking
for, like, ten minutes

59:31.318 --> 59:33.695
and at the ten minute mark,
I hadn't said a word,

59:33.779 --> 59:35.489
and he literally said, he goes,

59:36.073 --> 59:37.741
"You haven't said anything!"

59:37.824 --> 59:39.326
[audience laughing]

59:40.285 --> 59:42.120
"Am I talking too much?"

59:42.913 --> 59:44.790
And I said, "Mr. Pacino,

59:45.165 --> 59:47.626
this is one of the greatest moments
of my life.

59:48.126 --> 59:49.961
Please keep talking till I come."

59:50.212 --> 59:52.380
[audience laughing]

59:57.344 --> 59:59.679
And he said, "A challenge!"

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.306
[audience laughing]

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.936
Then he said to me, he goes, "Do you act?"

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:08.855
Al Pacino says, "Do you act?"
and I'm like,

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.273
"I've acted.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:11.191
[chuckles]

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.610
I'm not an actor. I'm a comedian."

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:15.654
And he goes, "Oh!

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.573
I know a lot about acting,"

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.201
and I was like, "Yeah you do."

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.411
[audience laughing]

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:26.206
And he's like,
"You're going to be a great actor!

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.374
A great actor!"

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:30.168
And I'm like a fat chick being hit on.
I'm like...

01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:32.379
[audience laughing]

01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:38.593
Then he went, "No, fuck it!

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:39.970
Don't act!

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:42.597
You're better than us.

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:44.516
Acting's for idiots like me and him.

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:47.602
He points at Warren Beatty,
and Warren Beatty, at this stage,

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:50.021
is looking at a moth going
around a tiki torch, like...

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.523
[audience laughing]

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.735
He goes, "You're better than us.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:58.029
You tell stories.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:00.991
You're a director."

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:04.578
And I'm like, "All right."

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.498
He's like, "Say it for me.

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:11.710
Say, 'I'm a director.'"

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.506
[audience laughing]

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:19.551
I went "I'm a director."

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:21.344
[audience laughing]

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.555
And he went, "Say it again!"

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:27.642
And I went, "I'm a director."

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.188
And he goes, "One more time.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:36.693
But this time I need more passion
from you, George Jamison."

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:39.029
[audience laughing]

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:45.869
So I just got the fever and I went,

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.579
"I'm a director!"

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:50.040
Everyone there stopped
what the fuck they were doing.

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:52.792
They all stared at me, and I went,
"I don't know what's going on."

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:54.419
[audience laughing]

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.671
Warren Beatty's all confused.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.924
He leans over and goes, "Um...

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.302
What do you direct?"

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:07.849
You know when you're a kid in your teens,
you just lie all the time?

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:11.478
But you don't really lie past 30.
You lie to get yourself out of trouble.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:15.357
Lies like, "I don't know that girl,
I was somewhere else."

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.483
Right?

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.109
[audience laughing]

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:22.989
I just did one of those teenage lies.
He goes, "What do you direct?"

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:26.284
And I said,
"I've directed two independent films...

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:30.372
and I have a big budget film
in the works with Warner Bros."

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.208
[audience laughing]

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.920
And then Warren Beatty
looks at me and goes, "Um...

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.881
How can we stay in touch?"

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:42.425
And I just went...

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:46.596
"I'm fucking lying, man."

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.057
[audience laughing]

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.476
And before I could say anything else,

01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:54.062
my manager saw that I was
drowning in this conversation,

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:56.606
he swooped in, so Hollywood-y,
he goes,

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.317
"I love this.
Jim Jefferies, Warren Beatty,

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:01.236
you're gonna make a lot
of great films together.

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:04.322
Here's what we're gonna do.
You're gonna take my number, Warren,

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:06.283
I'm gonna take yours.
We're gonna stay in touch."

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.994
They start swapping numbers
and I'm standing off to the side,

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:10.954
like, "I don't know
what the fuck this is."

01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:12.038
[audience laughing]

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:14.708
Before I could say anything stupid,
Alex puts his arm around me,

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.293
and drags me out of the party.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:19.504
I'm like, "I don't know
what just happened, Alex."

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:22.882
He turned me and went, "You're gonna
have to learn how to direct."

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:26.803
[audience laughing and cheering]

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:38.148
Now, before we go, on all my specials,
I do this little bit at the end.

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:40.567
Um, I mention depression.

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:46.072
Depression has been something
that has been a major part of my life.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:49.075
Not just my life, but my father's life,

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.036
and it has sort of controlled...

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:54.414
um, everything for me.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:58.460
Now, if you're suffering
from depression...

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.172
As I hit 40, it's gotten a bit better.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.799
And it's gotten a bit better

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.802
because I was speaking to my dad,
who's 76,

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.763
and I said,
"Dad, why aren't you depressed?"

01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:11.139
And he said, "Ah...

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.308
what are you going to do?"

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:15.226
Now...

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.854
[audience laughing]

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:20.398
That actually said something to me.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.276
It said something big in my brain,
actually,

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.236
it flicked a switch.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:29.240
All right, 'cause I wasted my 20s
being depressed,

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:30.950
the prime years of my life.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.578
I wasted most of my 30s being depressed,

01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:35.663
and a lot of you
may have done that as well.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.916
But this is the thing, right?

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:43.296
The only reason we're depressed
in our 20s and our 30s and our 40s,

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.507
the prime of our life, is because of hope.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.094
[audience laughing]

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:55.892
'Cause we think that something better
is fucking coming, right?

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.938
You think you're gonna make it.
You think you're gonna be something.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:02.065
"What if I don't meet the woman
of my dreams?"

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.401
"What if I don't get the career I want?"

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:06.861
And then when you're old, you go, "Ha!"

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:11.116
[audience laughing]

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:13.993
"I guess none of that happened."

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:16.121
[audience laughing]

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:17.997
But then you're happy to be alive.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:22.794
See, I spent weeks, in my 20s,
in my fucking bed

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.589
going, "I don't want to live.
I can't get out of my fucking bed."

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:29.259
You know who doesn't do that?

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:31.678
People in their 90s.

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:35.974
You don't meet depressed people
in their 90s.

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:37.559
I used to be like, "I can't get up."

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:39.436
People in their 90s are like, "I'm up!"

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:40.854
[audience laughing]

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.730
"Did it again! Boom!"

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.984
[audience laughing and cheering]

01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:56.453
So all you have to do
is outlive your depression.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.538
[audience laughing]

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:04.669
And then embrace the things
that make you fucking weird.

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:08.173
All right, I'm 40, about to turn 41
in a few weeks, and...

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.049
[scattered cheers from crowd]

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:12.427
I'll tell you a weird thing about me.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:13.470
I have a passion.

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.138
My passion is this.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:18.892
I like little things
that look like they should be big things.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.311
I act like they're full-size,

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.812
but that I'm a giant.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.148
[audience laughing]

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:28.193
I'll give you an example.
When you're in a shitty hotel,

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.111
they give you
a little box of breakfast cereal?

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:32.864
I act like that's a full-size box
of breakfast cereal.

01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:35.742
Then I walk up to people and go,

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.453
"This is a full-size box
of breakfast cereal.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:40.580
I'm a giant!"

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:47.670
Like, my ex, Kate, she had to stop buying
cherry tomatoes and baby carrots,

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:49.714
'cause whenever we had them
in the house...

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:50.965
[audience laughing]

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:53.426
I was a pain in the ass.
I was always like, "Kate!

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:57.222
It's a regular size tomato!

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.725
I'm gonna eat it in one bite!

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.895
'Cause I'm a giant, Kate!"

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.857
Every time we went to a restaurant
and I ordered sliders,

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.734
she was like, "Fuck, here we go."

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:11.819
[audience laughing]

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.905
You don't wanna be sitting next to me
on a plane

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:16.282
when you get that little bottle of vodka.
I'm a nightmare.

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:19.953
I'm like... [yells]

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.580
"Everyone, I should be drunk!

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.625
I just drank a whole bottle of vodka.

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:28.545
But I'm not...

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:30.755
'cause I'm a giant!"

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:34.884
Now, this all came to a head
when my son was two.

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:38.179
We were trying to put him in preschool,

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:41.182
and we went around to the different
schools, we're taking the tours,

01:07:41.266 --> 01:07:44.477
and we were on this one tour,
at the school he actually ended up at,

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:47.272
and they were showing us the
play equipment in the classrooms,

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.148
and then we walked into the toilets.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.234
[audience laughing]

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:54.112
And they had these toilets
for two-year-olds,

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:57.156
which had little tiny bowls,
a little tiny seat,

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.492
a little tiny water thing,
and a little tiny flusher,

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.869
and as soon as I saw them...

01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:03.955
[audience laughing]

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.374
I was in heaven.

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:09.335
And the rest of the group kept walking,

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:11.921
and I acted like I was walking,
but I wasn't.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:14.090
'Cause I had to stick around,

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:17.176
because I had to do a shit
on a little toilet.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.761
[audience laughing]

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.470
I didn't even need to do a shit.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.682
This was an extra unnecessary shit.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.393
I had done a shit two hours earlier.

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:30.398
So I pull down my pants,
and I get on the little toilet, now,

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.984
maybe the happiest I've ever been.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.069
[audience laughing]

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:37.904
So I'm doing this shit,
and the hole's so small,

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:41.367
it only covers my asshole,
so my cock and balls are sitting up...

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.537
on the lip of the seat,

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:47.081
and I'm just beaming,
but then I reach a dilemma.

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:50.460
Often, when you shit,
you also need to wee.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.462
[audience laughing]

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.296
And my dick wanted to wee,

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:57.841
but I was just shitting,
so my dick was confused.

01:08:58.343 --> 01:09:02.471
My dick was like, "Name me a scenario
where shit is welcome and wee isn't."

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.015
[audience laughing]

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.977
I'm like, "We're just shitting right now."

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.854
It's like, "Fuck it, I'm gonna wee,"
and I'm like, "Please don't wee!

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.649
'Cause if you wee,
I'll become a sex offender,

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.609
and Hank won't get into the school...

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:17.194
and Kate won't get happy."

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:18.488
Now, at this stage,

01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:21.366
Kate realizes I've left the group.

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:22.950
[audience laughing]

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:24.327
And she walks back in

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:28.122
to see the father of her child
doing a shit on a little toilet,

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:30.582
with his cock and balls
sitting up on the lip.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:35.380
The look of disappointment
that just flooded her face...

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:38.049
I just looked at her like this.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:43.970
[audience laughing]

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:45.973
"I'm a giant, Kate!"

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:50.770
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.479
I loved every minute of it.

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:54.565
[audience cheering]

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:57.276
[rock music playing]

01:09:58.305 --> 01:10:04.239
