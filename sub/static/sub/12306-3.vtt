00:00.830 --> 00:04.323
[music playing]

00:04.330 --> 00:06.025
You ready?

00:06.040 --> 00:07.667
Ready.

00:46.270 --> 00:49.604
[cheering]

00:49.610 --> 00:51.044
Hi.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.404
[gunshot]

00:52.420 --> 00:56.243
[crowd screaming]

00:56.250 --> 00:59.413
No, no. Aah! Aah!

00:59.420 --> 01:01.616
[sobbing]

01:01.620 --> 01:06.421
Cara, cara baby.
Cara, cara.

01:18.310 --> 01:21.075
[indistinct chatter]

01:38.730 --> 01:40.152
A lot
of uniforms here.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.628
Janice told me this was
an open case,

01:41.630 --> 01:43.826
But I didn't get
all the details.

01:43.830 --> 01:45.628
Is the victim a cop?

01:45.630 --> 01:47.394
Daughter of one.
Jimmy lambert,

01:47.400 --> 01:48.890
Lieutenant downtown.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.334
Beth.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.762
Detective wilkes.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.636
My team's first
on the scene.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.710
This case started
with you,

01:54.710 --> 01:55.973
So if you could prep
my men here.

01:55.980 --> 01:57.072
It's still my case, trent.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.299
Of course,
and we're going to

01:59.320 --> 02:00.139
Assist you, ok?

02:00.150 --> 02:01.640
It's one
of our own, beth.

02:01.650 --> 02:02.845
All hands on deck.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.648
How's cara?

02:04.650 --> 02:05.742
Not good.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.388
Bullet passed right
through her skull.

02:07.390 --> 02:08.652
She's in surgery.

02:08.660 --> 02:09.786
You find the slug?

02:09.789 --> 02:12.179
You identify where
the shot came from?

02:12.190 --> 02:16.149
Rooftop across the street
to the west here.

02:16.170 --> 02:16.898
You sure?

02:16.900 --> 02:19.528
That's not
an easy shot.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.099
I'm sorry. Who--
who are you?

02:21.100 --> 02:23.034
Jack larsen.
New guy.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.235
Trent wilkes,
robbery homicide.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.834
Jack just transferred
to tau.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.639
Ok. Yeah. I'm sure
the shot came

02:29.650 --> 02:30.572
From that rooftop.

02:30.580 --> 02:31.945
We found a sniper's nest.

02:31.950 --> 02:33.247
He also left
some fibers behind

02:33.250 --> 02:34.399
From a screening mesh.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.319
Mesh?
Yeah.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.572
_That's what
military snipers use

02:36.590 --> 02:37.739
To camouflage
their locations.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.548
Right. Looks like he was
perched their for hours

02:39.560 --> 02:41.312
Just waiting, hiding.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.483
No, new york. I would
have led with that.

02:44.490 --> 02:46.379
Also no surveillance
footage.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.792
This guy's really good
at avoiding cameras.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.121
Anything you need, beth.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.367
What's his deal?

02:56.370 --> 02:57.064
Why?

02:57.070 --> 02:59.402
Eh. Get a weird vibe.

02:59.410 --> 03:00.536
It's you.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.304
You make
bad first impressions.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.745
Do I? Every time?

03:04.750 --> 03:06.343
Maybe I suck.
So I suck?

03:06.350 --> 03:08.148
The victim is
cara lambert, 24.

03:08.150 --> 03:09.675
Tau was called in
two years ago

03:09.690 --> 03:12.182
When her jock ex-boyfriend
paul watson decided

03:12.190 --> 03:15.182
He was gonna stalk her during
their senior year of college.

03:15.190 --> 03:16.589
He didn't take kindly
to the fact

03:16.590 --> 03:18.479
That she left him
to pursue women.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.958
Huh. That had
to hurt

03:19.960 --> 03:21.223
If the guy has
as fragile ego.

03:21.230 --> 03:22.755
Right. Well, there's
an apb out.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.898
Full manhunt's in effect.
We got to go.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.664
We have work to do.

03:38.710 --> 03:41.873
No. She's still
in surgery.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.709
You were supposed to
protect her.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.790
You told me I could
trust you.

03:47.790 --> 03:51.090
You're not helping
things, jimmy.

03:51.090 --> 03:51.989
I'm sorry.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.458
Tell that
to my baby.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.098
She came to you
for help.

03:55.100 --> 03:55.919
Come on, come on.

03:55.930 --> 03:57.694
You said you'd
handled this.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.599
Come on.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.592
Paul was there.
I saw him.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.431
At the wedding?

04:02.440 --> 04:04.909
A couple hours
before the ceremony.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.366
I saw him in front
of the hotel.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.337
He saw me,
and he ran scared.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.478
I thought that
would be it.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.800
He's not gonna get
away with this.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.278
We'll find paul.
Let us do our jobs.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.408
I did that,
and now my baby is

04:14.420 --> 04:16.946
On an
operating table.

04:16.950 --> 04:18.213
While we're looking
for paul,

04:18.220 --> 04:19.779
Is there anyone else
we should be looking at?

04:19.790 --> 04:21.952
You've got one job,
lady--find paul!

04:21.959 --> 04:23.780
They got to go
by the numbers.

04:23.790 --> 04:24.951
You know this.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.782
Jack: Anyone else you
and cara had a run-in with?

04:27.800 --> 04:28.551
No.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.652
Why are you
still here?

04:29.670 --> 04:31.149
You're a cop, lieutenant.
You can't tell me

04:31.170 --> 04:32.660
You haven't pissed
some people off.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.229
Any perps with grudges

04:34.240 --> 04:35.890
Or someone
you arrested recently,

04:35.900 --> 04:37.231
Anything like that?

04:37.240 --> 04:38.230
Why is he talking--

04:38.240 --> 04:39.503
Me and jimmy
used to ride together.

04:39.510 --> 04:41.535
The boys back - at the station
are going over our caseload.

04:41.540 --> 04:42.905
We'll reach out
to them.

04:42.910 --> 04:45.277
I'm telling you
it was paul.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.601
A couple weeks ago--

04:47.620 --> 04:49.475
A couple weeks ago,
cara said that she thought

04:49.490 --> 04:50.912
She was being followed.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.514
Did she see anyone?

04:53.520 --> 04:55.614
No.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.816
Why didn't you
say something to me?

04:57.830 --> 04:59.628
We didn't want
to believe it.

04:59.630 --> 05:02.349
We thought it was
all behind her.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.091
Let's take a walk.
Come on.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.005
Man: I thought she
was joking.

05:16.010 --> 05:20.345
Gay? How--how was
that even possible?

05:20.350 --> 05:22.773
We were doing it
regularly,

05:22.790 --> 05:25.612
And I'm telling
you, man.

05:25.620 --> 05:29.284
Is that why you put that tape
of you two having sex online?

05:29.290 --> 05:30.212
Nice try.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.482
No. I didn't
post it.

05:31.490 --> 05:33.356
Pfft. I'm not sorry
that it's out there.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.249
The dudes on my team
were saying

05:35.260 --> 05:37.319
That I turned
her gay.

05:37.330 --> 05:39.321
Now they
can see that

05:39.340 --> 05:43.163
I was laying it
down right.

05:43.170 --> 05:47.266
Cara: He was texting
me and calling me

05:47.280 --> 05:50.580
All through the night,
so I turned my phone off,

05:50.580 --> 05:51.843
And then at 2:00
in the morning,

05:51.850 --> 05:54.547
The fire alarm went off
in my building.

05:54.550 --> 05:57.144
I went outside,
and there he was

05:57.150 --> 05:58.311
Just staring at me.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.344
Ben: Did he
threaten you?

05:59.360 --> 06:01.988
No, but he had
this look in his eyes

06:01.990 --> 06:04.152
I had never seen before.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.719
It was like
he hated me.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.152
Ben: I need you
to leave her alone.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.252
I need her
to understand

06:08.260 --> 06:09.455
That she can't play
games with me.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.029
She's not playing
games, paul.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.520
She likes girls. She's
not interested in you--

06:12.530 --> 06:15.067
Then why was she with
me in the first place?

06:15.070 --> 06:16.162
Your feelings are hurt.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.729
No. I just don't like
being lied to.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.367
She doesn't get
to do that to me.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.530
Ben: Has he ever
been violent?

06:21.540 --> 06:24.032
No.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.506
But I can feel it.

06:25.510 --> 06:29.572
What--what can you
feel, cara?

06:29.590 --> 06:31.581
He wants to kill me.

06:31.590 --> 06:34.150
Beth: What do you think?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.413
This paul guy is not
winning me over.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.751
Ben: Patrol's sitting
on paul's apartment.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.855
S.I1.D. Recovered the slug
from the crime scene.

06:41.860 --> 06:42.998
They're running
ballistics.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.321
We retrieved cara's
stalker diary

06:45.330 --> 06:47.628
After the restraining
order was put in place,

06:47.640 --> 06:48.960
There was very little
contact with paul,

06:48.970 --> 06:50.699
But there are a couple of
recent entries where she states

06:50.710 --> 06:52.132
That she feels like
she's being watched,

06:52.140 --> 06:53.403
But she wasn't sure
it was paul.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.378
Beth: Did pd recover
paul's laptop

06:55.380 --> 06:56.302
From the apartment.

06:56.310 --> 06:57.732
Ben: Yeah. I'm still
going through it,

06:57.750 --> 06:59.070
But the browser history
shows that he was

06:59.080 --> 07:00.445
Looking at cara's
wedding announcement

07:00.450 --> 07:01.713
<i>In the ".A. Times"
a couple days ago.</i>

07:01.720 --> 07:03.119
That could have been
the trigger that

07:03.120 --> 07:04.417
Reignited
his obsession.

07:04.420 --> 07:05.546
I did the assessment.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.517
Paul was a howler.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.817
I mean, he made
e-mail threats,

07:07.820 --> 07:08.981
He texted her,
wanted attention,

07:08.990 --> 07:10.355
But there was never
any history of violence,

07:10.360 --> 07:13.455
No mental health issues,
no other legal misconduct.

07:13.460 --> 07:14.757
The victim's father
encountered paul

07:14.760 --> 07:16.250
At the wedding
locale this morning.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.692
You're saying I missed it?

07:17.700 --> 07:18.861
No. I'm not
saying that.

07:18.870 --> 07:20.622
That's what it sounds like.
That's what you heard.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.562
I didn't say that.

07:21.570 --> 07:22.890
Janice: We get over
300 cases a year

07:22.910 --> 07:26.505
You know how many of those
freaks go south without warning?

07:26.510 --> 07:27.602
Can we just find
paul watson?

07:27.610 --> 07:29.100
We're reaching out
to friends, family,

07:29.110 --> 07:30.373
Anyone that might know
his whereabouts.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.802
Ben: Paul modified
his behavior in response

07:31.810 --> 07:32.845
To the restraining order.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.705
He was afraid
of jeopardizing his future.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.710
This doesn't add up.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.382
The shooter sat
in a nest for hours,

07:38.390 --> 07:40.779
Waiting to take
one single shot.

07:40.790 --> 07:44.579
That takes training
and precision.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.024
Did paul have
experience with guns?

07:46.030 --> 07:47.782
Was he
a military boy?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.553
No. He grew up in
colorado hunting. That's it.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.289
That requires discipline.
It was unemotional.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.598
Ben: It doesn't fit
paul's harassment pattern.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.090
Paul was
a rejected stalker,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.101
Rash, impulsive, angry.

07:59.110 --> 08:00.362
And I'm agreeing
with you.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.905
Janice: Patrol's got
a lead on paul watson.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.470
A car with missing plates,
same make and model as his

08:04.480 --> 08:05.675
Was found near
an airport motel

08:05.680 --> 08:07.444
Where a man matching
his description

08:07.450 --> 08:08.713
Checked in,
paying cash.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.210
Get us two backup.
Don't let the location out.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.314
I don't want a bunch
of angry cops

08:12.320 --> 08:14.482
Showing up before I do.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.308
Jack: Hey! Stop!

08:55.100 --> 08:56.590
[sirens]

08:56.600 --> 08:58.694
Beth: Stop!

08:58.700 --> 09:00.395
Paul watson!

09:04.440 --> 09:05.703
Look. I didn't do it.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.462
Why are you running?

09:07.480 --> 09:09.403
Ugh! Unh!

09:09.410 --> 09:12.107
Let's stop with
the running, huh?

09:14.080 --> 09:16.071
[groans]

09:22.990 --> 09:23.855
Hey.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.350
Paul's ready.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.589
Is his lawyer here?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.592
He says he doesn't
need one.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.568
Beth: Thanks
for coming.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.823
Let's do this.

09:34.570 --> 09:37.562
Beth: Paul, this is
deputy d.A. Amanda taylor.

09:37.570 --> 09:39.629
Before you say anything,
I need you to acknowledge

09:39.640 --> 09:41.972
In her presence that
you waive your right to an--

09:41.980 --> 09:42.833
Yeah, fine.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.875
I don't need
a lawyer

09:43.880 --> 09:45.143
Because I didn't
shoot cara.

09:45.150 --> 09:46.640
You are aware that
everything you're saying here

09:46.650 --> 09:48.311
Is on record and can
and will be used

09:48.320 --> 09:49.446
Against you?

09:49.450 --> 09:50.349
Yes, I get it.

09:50.350 --> 09:52.239
I'd like to
acknowledge

09:52.250 --> 09:56.357
That paul watson understands
his miranda rights by law.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.509
He's all yours.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.180
Thank you.

09:59.190 --> 10:01.625
So you never went
to her wedding?

10:01.630 --> 10:02.825
No.

10:02.830 --> 10:03.922
We have a withess
putting you

10:03.930 --> 10:05.091
At the hotel
this morning, paul.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.499
I'm sorry. Yes.
I was at the hotel,

10:06.500 --> 10:07.820
But it was hours
before the wedding.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.797
Jack: Giving you time to
set up your little shiper's nest

10:09.810 --> 10:11.630
On the roof
across the street.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.402
No.

10:12.410 --> 10:13.536
So why did you
run from us?

10:13.540 --> 10:15.702
When I heard that
cara had been shot,

10:15.710 --> 10:18.179
I knew that her
father and every cop

10:18.180 --> 10:20.740
In I.LA. Would come
after me.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.149
Jimmy's a hardass.

10:22.150 --> 10:23.675
Beth: Why didn't
you come to me?

10:23.690 --> 10:26.011
Would you have
believed me?

10:26.020 --> 10:27.886
Do you believe me now?

10:27.890 --> 10:30.052
- We found a rifle
in your motel room.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.620
Yeah. To protect myself.

10:32.630 --> 10:33.859
Test it.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.999
I didn't shoot cara.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.593
Ben: There was no
gunshot residue found

10:37.600 --> 10:38.863
On paul's hands
or clothing,

10:38.870 --> 10:41.328
And his rifle wasn't
fired recently.

10:41.340 --> 10:42.592
Or he wore gloves
and dumped

10:42.600 --> 10:43.863
The actual rifle
he used.

10:43.870 --> 10:46.840
We have no recent evidence
of paul harassing cara.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.729
Beth: What were you doing
at the hotel this morning?

10:48.740 --> 10:52.802
I just wanted to apologize
to her for being an ass.

10:52.810 --> 10:55.211
You ever hear of a
text, tweet, or an e-mail?

10:55.220 --> 10:58.110
You violated your
restraining order.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.181
You and ben told me
to get some therapy.

11:01.190 --> 11:03.181
I did. It helped.

11:03.190 --> 11:04.282
That whole thing
with cara,

11:04.290 --> 11:06.588
It was the first time
in my entire life

11:06.600 --> 11:09.126
Where I couldn't
get my way.

11:09.130 --> 11:10.097
I was a spoiled jerk,

11:10.100 --> 11:11.966
And, yeah,
I did mess with her,

11:11.970 --> 11:13.392
But I get that now.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.959
So you show up
at her wedding?

11:14.970 --> 11:17.337
Look. I just wanted
one minute,

11:17.340 --> 11:19.365
One minute with her
before her wedding

11:19.370 --> 11:21.873
So I could
wish her well,

11:21.880 --> 11:23.735
And maybe I didn't
think it through.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.673
After everything that
went down between us,

11:25.680 --> 11:28.411
I--I thought it
would matter to her.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.172
Seems like he's actively
trying to get over cara.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.285
That's not typical
of a revengeful stalker.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.452
Yeah? Or he's
just lying.

11:35.460 --> 11:37.952
Beth: Ok.
What happened?

11:37.960 --> 11:42.955
I never even saw her because
her lunatic dad chased me away.

11:42.960 --> 11:46.919
I didn't shoot cara.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.390
Trent: We can't let
the guy walk.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.809
Well, we don't have
enough to hold him.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.562
Amanda: I can build
a circumstantial case

11:53.580 --> 11:56.777
A disgruntled stalker
with motive and opportunity.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.134
That's not enough
for trial.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.073
Trent: Put enough pressure
on him, he'll plead to it.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.447
For the last 9 years, I walked
homicide in new york city.

12:02.450 --> 12:04.009
I'm telling you,
this guy's not a liar.

12:04.020 --> 12:05.545
Why is it that new
yorkers remind us

12:05.550 --> 12:07.314
Where they're from?

12:07.320 --> 12:08.981
Jack: Now call me
unpopular,

12:08.990 --> 12:10.754
But I don't think
paul did it.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.023
Are you serious?
Yep.

12:12.030 --> 12:13.680
Beth: I'm with jack.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.883
Paul's an emotional
hothead,

12:14.900 --> 12:17.323
But we're looking for the
complete opposite of paul.

12:17.330 --> 12:18.889
And who would
that be?

12:18.900 --> 12:22.234
Male, ex-military, 30s,

12:22.240 --> 12:23.196
Precision sharpshooter,

12:23.210 --> 12:25.565
Maybe green beret
or some specialty team,

12:25.570 --> 12:28.801
Analytical, stoic,
outwardly not emotional,

12:28.810 --> 12:31.973
But internally, he's
eaten alive by his feelings,

12:31.980 --> 12:33.004
Consumed by them.

12:33.010 --> 12:36.742
The man's obsession
controls him, fuels him,

12:36.750 --> 12:39.185
Keeping him focused
and precise.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.885
He's obsessed,

12:40.890 --> 12:44.053
And my gut says
he's not done.

12:53.330 --> 12:54.559
The stick's
not working.

12:54.570 --> 12:56.891
Well, we have to
do it manually.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.004
Get the crane in.

12:59.010 --> 13:02.935
We did it. Now all we
have to do is gas up and go.

13:02.940 --> 13:06.570
Psst. Vrrrm, vrrrm.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.811
Hey. You didn't
finish your dinner.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.049
Are you hungry?

13:11.050 --> 13:12.848
No.

13:16.560 --> 13:20.428
We did it! Yes!

13:20.430 --> 13:21.682
Are you sure?

13:21.700 --> 13:23.156
Yes.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.025
Ok.

13:29.300 --> 13:33.601
Honey, you didn't
clean your room.

13:33.610 --> 13:36.500
What did I say, huh?

13:57.830 --> 13:59.798
[sighs]

14:01.640 --> 14:03.768
Boy: Mom, can you
come help me?

14:03.770 --> 14:06.239
All right, honey.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.459
I'm coming.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.194
So how'd you get
the spot?

14:34.200 --> 14:35.270
Excuse me?

14:35.270 --> 14:38.831
Tauis
a specialized unit.

14:38.840 --> 14:39.568
Elite.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.163
Was that insult
accidental

14:41.180 --> 14:42.670
Or intentional?

14:42.680 --> 14:43.829
No. Seriously.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.308
There were 300
applicants for your spot.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.620
Beth chose you.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.315
That's a good question.

14:50.320 --> 14:53.290
I'll have to ask her
sometime.

14:53.290 --> 14:56.316
Unless you were
a favor,

14:56.320 --> 14:59.824
Somebody owes
somebody something,

14:59.830 --> 15:01.753
You're the iou.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.695
Why don't you ask
beth yourself?

15:04.700 --> 15:06.395
I will.

15:11.610 --> 15:14.568
Janice: Beth, ballistics came
back on the slug from the rooftop.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.378
It's not a match
with paul's rifle.

15:16.380 --> 15:17.973
Well, that's not
a surprise.

15:17.980 --> 15:19.607
Right, but this is.

15:19.610 --> 15:21.339
Our bullet matches as lug
taken out of a gang member

15:21.350 --> 15:23.375
Who was shot and killed
in south central.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.243
When was he shot?

15:24.250 --> 15:26.446
Early this morning
before cara.

15:26.450 --> 15:27.849
Doesn't make
any sense.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.010
Work up a profile
on the new victim.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.213
Maybe it will give
us something.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.028
On it. His girlfriend
is in house for questioning.

15:33.030 --> 15:34.122
I'll talk to her.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.098
Get back to me.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.254
Boy: Vrrrm. Psshhht!

15:38.270 --> 15:40.625
Ok, honey.
It's time for bed.

15:40.640 --> 15:45.237
Let's put everything
away, please.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.560
Thank you.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.301
Daddy will be home
any minute, ok?

15:49.310 --> 15:51.130
Ok.

16:09.630 --> 16:10.449
Coffee?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.666
No. I been here
all day.

16:12.670 --> 16:13.967
I'm going home.

16:13.970 --> 16:15.119
I know this is
a tough time

16:15.140 --> 16:17.268
And answering all these
questions is a hassle,

16:17.270 --> 16:21.229
But if you know who shot
jesse, you can help me out.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.537
I told every cop here

16:22.540 --> 16:25.441
I straight up
don't know.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.975
Tiny, you know what
I really enjoy

16:29.990 --> 16:31.981
After a hard day
at work?

16:31.990 --> 16:32.912
Do I look like I care?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.342
There's this little bar
in silver lake

16:34.360 --> 16:36.055
<i>That makes the best
MOSCOW mule,.</i>

16:36.060 --> 16:37.550
I meeting my friend
there tonight.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.757
I think you know here--
cleo tate?

16:40.760 --> 16:41.488
Who?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.628
You probation officer.

16:43.630 --> 16:44.654
I didn't do
anything.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.799
Those track marks
on your arm say otherwise.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.029
You're a bitch.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.963
I prefer assertive.

16:50.970 --> 16:53.132
Sit down.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.710
I still don't know
who shot jesse.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.916
Anything out of the
ordinary happen lately?

17:02.920 --> 17:08.188
Did jesse ever talk about
being followed or watched?

17:08.190 --> 17:09.510
Yeah.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.749
He said he thought
there was someone

17:10.760 --> 17:12.159
In the apartment
one day.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.458
A couple of weeks ago, I
saw him looking of his shoulder,

17:14.460 --> 17:16.428
So I asked him
about it.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.648
He said it was nothing

17:18.670 --> 17:20.729
He thought he was
being paranoid.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.299
What did you think?

17:22.300 --> 17:24.439
He either was or wasn't.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.603
He was in a gang,
so he's been followed,

17:27.609 --> 17:31.979
Marked, had his ass
whupped more times...

17:31.980 --> 17:34.904
[crying]

17:37.280 --> 17:39.487
Nearly done.

17:39.490 --> 17:43.984
Do you know this man--
paul watson?

17:43.990 --> 17:46.357
No.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.227
This woman was shot today
with the same gun

17:49.230 --> 17:51.221
Used to kill jesse.

17:51.230 --> 17:52.425
What's her name?

17:52.430 --> 17:55.195
Cara lambert.
Do you know her?

17:55.200 --> 17:59.137
No, but I think jesse
said there's a cop

17:59.140 --> 18:00.767
With the same last name.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.636
Jimmy lambert?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.948
Yeah. Jimmy lambert.

18:05.950 --> 18:08.044
Janice, voice-over: Jimmy
lambert arrested the dead banger

18:08.050 --> 18:09.779
Jesse hightower
a few years ago

18:09.780 --> 18:10.975
When he was still
in the street.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.719
Used him as a c.I.
Instead of putting him away,

18:12.720 --> 18:14.518
But here's
the weird thing.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.919
They became friends.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.888
That's what
the girlfriend said.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.426
When jimmy was a kid,
he was on a bad track.

18:19.430 --> 18:21.353
A cop turned things
around for him.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.055
Jimmy was trying
to pay it forward.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.391
He tried to get
jesse out of the life,

18:24.400 --> 18:26.129
Encouraged him and his
girlfriend to get their geds.

18:26.130 --> 18:28.622
Jimmy would come by, check
in on him like he really cared.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.233
He was a work in progress,
but they had

18:30.240 --> 18:32.629
This odd father-son
relationship.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.005
Jimmy: Jesse hightower
is dead?

18:34.010 --> 18:37.105
Beth: We know you were
looking out for him.

18:37.110 --> 18:38.339
That kid had
a lot of potential.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.047
He was killed with the same
gun that was used on cara.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.313
Well, that doesn't
make sense.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.072
My daughter didn't
even know him.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.512
Why would paul
shoot jesse?

18:45.520 --> 18:46.840
Well, that's it.
He wouldn't.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.282
Maybe someone with an ax
to grind against you.

18:48.290 --> 18:50.384
Are you saying that I'm
the common denominator here?

18:50.390 --> 18:53.758
Yes. Does anyone have
a grievance against you?

18:53.760 --> 18:55.489
More importantly, who
else could be in danger?

18:55.500 --> 18:56.797
We need a list of
your family members.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.589
Uh, my sister and her family
are in town for the wedding.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.967
We're securing
everyone on the guest list.

19:02.970 --> 19:03.937
Who else?

19:03.940 --> 19:05.169
My brother in chicago.

19:05.170 --> 19:06.763
Ok. But there has to be
more family and friends.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.705
Maybe your old partner can
help put together a list for us.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.030
Jimmy, where's frank?

19:11.050 --> 19:14.202
We were told
he'd be with you.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.176
He just left.

19:15.180 --> 19:16.670
How close
are you guys?

19:16.680 --> 19:18.409
He's my closest friend.

19:18.420 --> 19:20.548
Get him
on the phone.

19:24.190 --> 19:25.487
It's going straight
to voicemail.

19:25.490 --> 19:26.787
What's his address?

19:26.790 --> 19:30.852
Uh, 1949 sterling drive,
studio city.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.828
I'll get uniforms
en route.

19:46.150 --> 19:48.608
Hey.

19:52.050 --> 19:56.590
He's a wreck.
Still at the hospital.

19:56.590 --> 19:57.489
And cara?

19:57.490 --> 19:59.151
There's no word yet.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.481
I tried calling you, but you
weren't picking up your phone.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.526
Yeah. They made me
turn my phone off at icu.

20:04.530 --> 20:06.567
Must have forgotten
to turn it back on.

20:06.570 --> 20:08.060
I'll make you
something to eat.

20:08.070 --> 20:10.368
Why don't you
go shower?

20:10.370 --> 20:11.667
Perfect.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.638
Thank you, baby.

[creak]

20:42.170 --> 20:43.797
Oh, ho ho! Hey.

20:43.810 --> 20:44.538
Hey, dad.

20:44.540 --> 20:45.701
What are you
doing up?

20:45.710 --> 20:48.168
I wanted to see you.

20:50.140 --> 20:51.437
You want a ride?
Sure.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.339
Come on.

20:54.510 --> 20:57.275
Agghhh!

21:10.100 --> 21:12.296
[knock on door]

21:22.210 --> 21:23.234
Can I help you?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.332
I'm lieutenant beth davis.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.977
Who's at home with you,
mrs. Santos?

21:25.980 --> 21:29.746
All right. Will you
step outside, please?

21:29.750 --> 21:31.514
Please.

22:21.770 --> 22:23.590
Aah!

22:30.210 --> 22:32.542
Jack?

22:32.550 --> 22:33.779
Jack.

22:33.780 --> 22:35.077
He's here.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.445
He's running!

22:36.450 --> 22:38.316
Move! He's running!

22:38.320 --> 22:39.412
You're bleeding.

22:39.420 --> 22:41.218
I'm fine.

22:45.630 --> 22:46.688
I didn't see
his face.

22:46.690 --> 22:48.158
He was built, under
6 feet, wiry, strong.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.049
Guy was fast. He knew
what he was doing.

22:50.060 --> 22:51.653
He sat in frank's closet
for hours?

22:51.670 --> 22:53.297
He sat on a rooftop
unseen for longer.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.997
He's special ops.
Has to be.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.297
Could be someone you
arrested or convicted.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.835
He's angry,
thinks you wronged him.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.060
Or he believes you hurt
someone he cares about.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.639
Beth davis.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.802
Think ex-military, proficient
with guns and knives.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.039
All right. Got it.

23:07.050 --> 23:09.041
Two guys you asked us
to check out,

23:09.050 --> 23:11.576
I keep a list of all
the people that have made

23:11.590 --> 23:15.288
Credible threats
against me in my office.

23:15.290 --> 23:17.452
I think there are a few
more that fit that profile.

23:17.460 --> 23:21.658
Those are from last year.
This is this year.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.319
Who's that in the photo
with you, jimmy?

23:26.330 --> 23:30.437
That's me and jesse at
the midtown youth center.

23:32.610 --> 23:34.908
And cara and frank.

23:34.910 --> 23:37.777
Yeah.

23:37.780 --> 23:41.899
Today's victims. What
are you thinking, jack?

23:46.820 --> 23:50.757
Jimmy at his desk.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.822
Look where I'm sitting.

23:54.830 --> 23:58.130
Who sits here?

23:58.130 --> 24:01.168
My officers, men
under my command.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.797
Not perps?

24:02.800 --> 24:04.632
Never.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.438
Are we looking
for a cop?

24:08.440 --> 24:10.374
One of my men?

24:10.380 --> 24:11.870
Someone who sat
right here staring

24:11.880 --> 24:14.577
At your loved ones
while you reprimanded him,

24:14.580 --> 24:17.948
Made him feel small.

24:17.950 --> 24:19.486
This is where it began.

24:19.490 --> 24:22.858
This where he started
plotting against you.

24:22.860 --> 24:25.454
Anyone work for you
who's ex-military?

24:25.460 --> 24:26.928
Most of my men are
ex-military.

24:26.930 --> 24:28.887
Someone who sat
right here, jimmy.

24:28.900 --> 24:32.120
And he's someone with
a grievance against you.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.993
Silas martin.

24:38.970 --> 24:41.701
I fired him
two years ago.

24:41.710 --> 24:42.677
Former special forces,

24:42.680 --> 24:44.205
Sharpshooter in afghanistan.

24:44.210 --> 24:45.769
Beth: Get me a last known
on silas martin,

24:45.780 --> 24:48.147
Former lapd,
metro division.

24:48.150 --> 24:49.379
Send patrol to his house.

24:49.380 --> 24:50.870
He's armed and dangerous.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.609
All right, jimmy.
What do we need to know?

24:53.620 --> 24:57.284
He killed a teenager in
a high-school parking lot,

24:57.290 --> 24:58.280
Said the kid
pulled a gun,

24:58.290 --> 25:01.351
But no weapon was recovered
at the scene.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.998
His military records
were clean,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.150
But when I did some digging,
I found that he was

25:05.170 --> 25:07.730
Treated for anxiety
as a kid,

25:07.740 --> 25:10.266
And I think there were
even more issues.

25:10.270 --> 25:12.932
The man was unstable.
I had to let him go.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.965
His appeal dragged
on and on,

25:14.980 --> 25:18.132
But his termination
was finalized 6 months ago.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.948
Did he ever
threaten you?

25:19.950 --> 25:23.375
No. He barely said
anything at his hearing.

25:23.380 --> 25:26.418
I knew he was upset,
but I would have never

25:26.420 --> 25:29.720
Beth: The dismissal
was just a trigger.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.017
The way he's
responding is tied

25:31.030 --> 25:33.351
To an underlying
psychosis.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.885
That son of a bitch.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.323
[cell phone chimes]

25:37.330 --> 25:40.265
We got an address.
Van nuys.

25:43.870 --> 25:46.669
[police radio chatter]

25:51.650 --> 25:53.345
Judging by the mail
piled up by the door,

25:53.350 --> 25:55.239
He hasn't been here
for a couple days.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.048
Janice: Found anxiety
meds in the bathroom.

25:57.050 --> 25:58.643
Doesn't look like
he's been taking them.

25:58.650 --> 25:59.981
Ben: He needs them.
He saw serious combat

25:59.990 --> 26:01.549
In afghanistan,
based on his records.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.190
Janice: You're gonna like
his taste in wallpaper.

26:29.050 --> 26:30.415
Janice: It's all
the legal filings

26:30.420 --> 26:32.479
From his hearings
and appeals.

26:32.490 --> 26:35.141
Diagrams of the shooting
that cost him his job.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.787
"Where's the gun?"

26:36.790 --> 26:38.610
He was trying to
prove his innocence.

26:38.630 --> 26:41.429
No local family, no
real friends, no girlfriend.

26:41.430 --> 26:43.057
Lapd was all
he had.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.721
Beth: So when his appeals
were rejected 6 months ago,

26:44.730 --> 26:46.220
He really did
lose everything.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.096
Stopped taking his meds,
his rational thinking

26:48.100 --> 26:52.970
Jimmy became the target
of his anger and frustration.

26:52.970 --> 26:54.062
He wants revenge.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.106
Not revenge. Revenge
is about damaging the enemy.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.407
This I resentful stalking.

26:58.410 --> 27:00.947
He needs retribution
against jimmy for firing him,

27:00.950 --> 27:03.749
But he also needs to
prove his righteousness.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.240
But resentful stalkers
rarely turn to violence.

27:05.250 --> 27:08.982
Ben: Listen to new guy.
He read the manual.

27:08.990 --> 27:10.810
Beth: Yeah, but this guy's
a soldier.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.355
Violence is in his nature.

27:12.360 --> 27:13.486
After his appeals
were rejected,

27:13.490 --> 27:14.855
He probably thought,
you know, he needed

27:14.860 --> 27:18.819
To escalate to regain some
power or control in his life.

27:18.830 --> 27:22.198
Janice: Guys, you need
to see this.

27:25.370 --> 27:28.408
S.I.D. Just
unlocked these.

27:30.740 --> 27:33.903
Silas was getting ready
for war.

27:35.350 --> 27:36.476
[sighs]

27:36.480 --> 27:38.642
Janice: But why target
jimmy's loved ones?

27:38.650 --> 27:41.711
Jimmy took away the
thing that silas valued most,

27:41.720 --> 27:42.983
His job,
his identity,

27:42.990 --> 27:46.051
So he's taking from jimmy
what he values most--

27:46.060 --> 27:49.553
The photos he saw every
time he went into jimmy's office.

27:49.560 --> 27:53.565
He must have thought about it over
and over and over a thousand times,

27:53.570 --> 27:56.267
<i>'Fantasized until
it wasn't enough.</i>

27:56.270 --> 27:58.193
He had to make it real.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.235
He planned and stalked
meticulously

28:00.240 --> 28:01.207
Over these last 6 months.

28:01.210 --> 28:02.700
And decided to turn
cara's wedding

28:02.710 --> 28:04.599
Into jimmy's day
of reckoning.

28:04.610 --> 28:06.999
Ben: Guys, check this out.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.715
I'm u.S. Special forces,
silas martin.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.712
I was a proud officer
of the lapd.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.621
I want to state officially
and for the record

28:19.630 --> 28:24.158
That you,
lieutenant james lambert,

28:24.170 --> 28:26.559
Dirtied my name
and my reputation.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.527
It's his manifesto.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.338
I showed up
at ever hearing

28:30.340 --> 28:32.707
Where I sat through
lie after lie.

28:32.710 --> 28:36.135
I trusted that the system
would vindicate me,

28:36.140 --> 28:39.849
But you, james lambert,
betrayed my faith.

28:39.850 --> 28:43.013
My name and my badge,
they were everything to me.

28:43.020 --> 28:44.112
You stole them from me.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.283
I was--heh--I was, what,
the innocent lamb

28:47.290 --> 28:48.985
In your evil lion's den?

28:48.990 --> 28:53.450
You drove me
to what I've become.

28:53.460 --> 28:54.484
This guy's lost it.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.128
I may not survive,
but I find solace

28:57.130 --> 28:59.224
I knowing that
in my final act

28:59.230 --> 29:03.189
I will reveal you
for the liar that you are,

29:03.200 --> 29:04.668
And then you and your lies

29:04.670 --> 29:08.561
Will be forever distinguished
on this plane.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.400
I will have my justice,

29:10.410 --> 29:13.072
And the truth will prevail.

29:14.620 --> 29:18.739
He made jimmy suffer, and
now he wants to confront him.

29:18.750 --> 29:19.911
He wants jimmy to
admit he lied

29:19.920 --> 29:21.888
To declare his
innocence.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.153
Where's jimmy now?

29:23.160 --> 29:25.288
With cara
at the hospital.

29:25.290 --> 29:27.054
I'll get back to you
with those stats.

29:27.060 --> 29:29.119
Ok.
Thanks.

29:44.140 --> 29:47.872
Hey. I'm still in here.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.670
Come on.
Not funny, guys.

29:52.690 --> 29:54.249
Unh!

30:11.100 --> 30:13.501
Would you like
a coffee?

30:13.510 --> 30:16.207
No. I'm good.

30:16.210 --> 30:18.702
I know I'm not what you
want for your daughter--

30:18.710 --> 30:19.802
Not now, terry, please.

30:19.810 --> 30:23.314
I'm sorry
about everything.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.311
Don't worry about it.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.685
You're off the hook.

30:26.690 --> 30:29.079
It's all my fault.

30:36.030 --> 30:37.259
I'm sorry.

30:37.260 --> 30:39.149
No worries.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.135

31:34.450 --> 31:35.588

31:35.590 --> 31:37.319
We have men all over
this place.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.810
Where's
jimmy lambert?

31:38.830 --> 31:40.855
I saw him around
20 minutes ago.

31:40.860 --> 31:41.850
He went down that hallway.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.658
I thought he had gone
to grab something to eat

31:43.660 --> 31:45.526
And that's the last
time you saw him?

31:45.530 --> 31:47.259
Yeah.

31:47.270 --> 31:48.522
Keep miss holt safe.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.861
You two, with me.

33:20.890 --> 33:21.652
[moans]

33:21.660 --> 33:24.027
Come on. Wake up.
No sleeping.

33:24.030 --> 33:26.089
We need to talk, jimmy.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.899
I think you have something
you want to tell me.

33:28.900 --> 33:31.460
Why are you
doing this?

33:31.470 --> 33:32.631
Unh!

33:32.640 --> 33:35.564
You know why.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.038
Your lies have
come home to roost.

33:38.050 --> 33:43.079
Huh? How's it feel?

33:43.080 --> 33:45.139
Got no fight in you
now, do you, huh?

33:45.150 --> 33:46.515
Are you ready to
tell me the truth?

33:46.520 --> 33:49.285
Because I really--
oh, god, jimmy!

33:49.290 --> 33:51.179
I need to hear
the truth.

33:51.190 --> 33:53.659
I know that that kid
had a gun.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.549
Wake up!

34:07.070 --> 34:09.232
Jimmy: Unh!

34:11.110 --> 34:12.998
Wake up, jimmy! Hmm?

34:13.010 --> 34:17.311
Come on, jimmy? What'd
you do with the gun, huh?

34:17.320 --> 34:18.969
Who moved the gun?
Tell me!

34:18.989 --> 34:22.415
I know that that kid--
that kid had a gun, jimmy.

34:22.420 --> 34:24.616
There was no gun.
We looked.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.826
You're lying, jimmy.

34:26.830 --> 34:28.127
Why do you keep lying?

34:28.130 --> 34:30.018
I saw a gun in his hand.

34:30.030 --> 34:32.748
He was gonna shoot me.

34:33.370 --> 34:36.396
Did my daughter have
a gun, too?

34:36.400 --> 34:38.129
Huh?

34:38.139 --> 34:39.699
That's your fault.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.168
That was your
fault, jimmy.

34:42.179 --> 34:44.672
That is your fault.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.399
You made me do that.

at your back.

34:52.820 --> 34:55.208
Turn around,
put your hands up.

your hands up.

for the swelling

36:30.550 --> 36:32.279
But they're hopeful.

36:32.290 --> 36:34.850
You ok, jimmy?
Doctors check you out?

36:34.860 --> 36:36.385
Yeah, I'm all right.

36:36.390 --> 36:37.880
I just can't help
thinking that--

36:37.890 --> 36:40.552
There is nothing more
you could have done.

36:40.560 --> 36:43.200
All that matters now
is that cara makes it.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.294
Well, she has to, and
when she wakes up,

36:45.300 --> 36:48.759
We're gonna have a
wedding, right, terry?

37:03.920 --> 37:05.513
Nice job, new guy.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.271
You think?

37:06.290 --> 37:09.681
I do. Have
a good night.

37:10.590 --> 37:14.322
Hey, ben. Your assessment
on paul was right on, man.

37:14.330 --> 37:17.527
I know. Good night.

37:21.070 --> 37:23.095
You got a second?

37:23.670 --> 37:25.934
No. There's nothing more
to talk about.

37:25.940 --> 37:27.305
You shouldn't have
followed me here.

37:27.310 --> 37:28.732
This isn't just
about you and me.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.970
This is
about our son.

37:30.980 --> 37:32.436
How is ethan?

37:32.450 --> 37:35.750
You're about 7 years
too late to play that card.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.378
I gave you two weeks, jack.
Time's ticking.

37:38.390 --> 37:42.509
Leave |.A., or I'm
gonna force your hand.

37:52.270 --> 37:56.798
Is there something I need to
know about you and amanda?

37:56.800 --> 37:58.359
No.

37:58.370 --> 38:00.099
So if I clocked |
some serious tension

38:00.110 --> 38:03.205
Between the two of you,
I'd be totally wrong?

38:03.210 --> 38:05.872
You know how I always make
a bad first impression.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.577
Right. Whatever it is,
fix it.

38:08.580 --> 38:11.880
I don't want it
poisoning my unit.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.540
You know,
I'm getting hungry.

38:13.550 --> 38:14.949
You want to grab
a bite to eat?

38:14.960 --> 38:15.984
No, thanks.

38:15.990 --> 38:19.756
Yes, and you don't
need to ask me again.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.080
What if I want to ask?

38:21.090 --> 38:23.855
<i>The answer
will always be no.</i>

38:23.860 --> 38:25.589
Got it.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.022
I know why you hate me.

38:27.030 --> 38:27.895
Yeah? Why's that?

38:27.900 --> 38:29.163
I was a favor.
My captain pushed

38:29.170 --> 38:30.729
My transfer
on your captain,

38:30.740 --> 38:31.639
And you had to take me.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.404
I know I wasn't
your first choice.

38:33.410 --> 38:34.832
Shocker.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.878
Or even your
second choice.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.939
I know you had
300 other applicants.

38:39.950 --> 38:45.309
372. You were not
even in the top 20.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.049
I'll try harder.

38:47.050 --> 38:49.212
Good thing you don't suck.

38:49.220 --> 38:52.451
Wait. You think I'm
doing a good job?

38:52.460 --> 38:55.225
Good night, jack.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.725
Good night.

39:46.780 --> 39:49.272
I saw someone outside.
