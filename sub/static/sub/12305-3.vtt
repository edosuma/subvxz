00:12.289 --> 00:17.127
a violent criminal who,this morning,beat
and robbed store clerk in hialeah.

00:30.641 --> 00:32.517
how do the defendants plea?

00:32.558 --> 00:33.936
Not guilty.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.395
Not guilty.

00:35.854 --> 00:37.356
Not guilty.

00:37.481 --> 00:40.567
Ms. Nevins,do the people
wish to be heard on bail?

00:40.609 --> 00:45.530
Your honor,this morning,defendants rentoria and
battle beat a store clerk within an inch of his life.

00:45.572 --> 00:47.950
Defendant monahan drove
them away from the scene.

00:47.991 --> 00:49.576
They don't deserve bail.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.161
no bail.

00:51.203 --> 00:55.165
The defendants are remanded to
custody,miami-dade department of detention.

00:55.999 --> 00:59.795
Next on the docket,state V.Kyle harmon.

00:59.836 --> 01:01.213
That's you,vato.

01:02.798 --> 01:06.009
sergeant tripp,the file
indicates you're the case I.O.

01:06.051 --> 01:08.136
Mr. Harmon was arrested for kidnapping?

01:08.178 --> 01:11.807
Your honor,the young man was not carrying
a weapon during the commission of the crime.

01:11.848 --> 01:13.892
He has no violent history.

01:13.934 --> 01:15.936
Therefore,he's not a threat.

01:16.019 --> 01:19.564
young man,are you kyle harmon?

01:19.606 --> 01:20.816
Yes,sir.

01:21.066 --> 01:26.530
You've been charged with unlawful
detention,kidnapping,a serious offense.

01:26.572 --> 01:28.198
Do you understand the charge?

01:28.282 --> 01:29.783
Yes,sir,I do.

01:29.866 --> 01:33.745
Which is why,even though you're
only 16,you'll be tried as an adult.

01:33.787 --> 01:35.330
How do you plea?

01:36.623 --> 01:38.333
in I plead not guilty,sir.

01:38.417 --> 01:40.294
Your next appearance
will be in department B.

01:40.335 --> 01:42.879
Until then,this court
remands you to custody.

01:47.342 --> 01:50.304
We've been told rentoria's
hearing has just adjourned.

01:50.387 --> 01:55.434
To put it lightly,there is a large crowd out
here anticipating his exit from the courthouse.

02:15.579 --> 02:18.540
Have you,uh,told kyle he's your son?

02:18.582 --> 02:20.500
I haven't yet.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.461
Take a look at this crowd.

02:22.502 --> 02:26.256
Must be at least a hundred knuckleheads
trying to get on television.

02:32.554 --> 02:36.975
I got two million
bucks,whoever can bust me out.

02:38.727 --> 02:40.646
Hey,baby,who's it gonna be?

02:40.687 --> 02:42.230
You could be the lucky winner.

02:42.272 --> 02:43.649
Hey,I got two mil,two million.

02:43.690 --> 02:45.150
Julio rentoria.

02:45.192 --> 02:47.402
Thinks he's the modern day jesse james.

02:47.444 --> 02:49.613
I got two mil,whoever can break me out.

02:49.655 --> 02:52.616
Hey,y'all,come on,two
mil,people. Who wants two mil?

02:53.200 --> 02:55.160
I love you,julio.

02:55.702 --> 02:56.828
Amy. That's my name.

02:56.870 --> 02:59.748
- Amy.
- Amy? Amelita,look me up.

03:01.291 --> 03:03.377
frank,you feel like taking a ride?

03:03.460 --> 03:04.253
On the bus?

03:04.294 --> 03:07.756
Yes. It looks like the
driver could use some help.

03:08.382 --> 03:09.424
I'm on it.

03:09.466 --> 03:11.051
Okay,frank.

03:42.291 --> 03:43.458
counselor.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.294
Horatio caine.

03:46.003 --> 03:49.131
So you're back in court
on this kyle harmon thing.

03:49.214 --> 03:50.507
Yeah,what about him?

03:50.549 --> 03:54.219
You are moving to try him as an adult.

03:54.261 --> 03:55.971
It was an adult crime,horatio.

03:56.013 --> 03:57.347
He kidnapped a woman.

03:57.389 --> 04:02.060
He is a child who was
blackmailed into the situation.

04:02.102 --> 04:04.062
Regardless,he made a bad choice.

04:04.104 --> 04:06.773
Children often do,don't they?

04:07.357 --> 04:11.862
Very clever,lieutenant,but he's
still going to be tried as an adult.

04:11.904 --> 04:13.071
Why do you care?

04:13.113 --> 04:14.573
I care...

04:17.284 --> 04:19.702
because it's my job.

04:23.957 --> 04:25.334
Good to see you.

06:21.325 --> 06:23.410
hey,let's go,let's go.

06:24.870 --> 06:26.121
Come on,move it,go.

06:26.163 --> 06:27.915
Let's get out of here.

06:31.209 --> 06:31.960
Guys,over here.

06:32.002 --> 06:33.295
Guys!

06:56.276 --> 07:00.530
India 2,100. 315.

07:00.697 --> 07:03.992
Two blocks east of biscayne courthouse.

07:04.618 --> 07:06.161
Shots fired.

07:25.472 --> 07:27.015
drop the gun!

07:58.213 --> 08:01.758
Confirming you have additional information
regarding escapees from the bus.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.467
Affirmative.

08:02.509 --> 08:03.635
Broadcast to follow.

08:03.677 --> 08:04.761
Frank.

08:04.803 --> 08:05.971
I'm fine.

08:06.013 --> 08:06.972
The prisoners.

08:07.014 --> 08:09.558
I got four escapees;
we're blanketing the city.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.852
Julio got his freedom,didn't
even have to pay for it.

08:11.893 --> 08:14.479
Where is kyle,frank?

08:14.563 --> 08:16.648
He's with 'em,horatio,he's gone.

08:16.690 --> 08:18.358
What do you want to do?

08:19.151 --> 08:20.527
I want to find him.

09:14.233 --> 09:15.484
How you doing?

09:17.403 --> 09:19.029
Fog of war.

09:19.196 --> 09:21.323
I didn't see that young lady till...

09:22.241 --> 09:23.450
you know.

09:26.036 --> 09:27.371
You talk to I.A.B.?

09:27.413 --> 09:29.373
No,but they're circling.

09:29.540 --> 09:31.375
I got two messages on my cell.

09:31.417 --> 09:35.629
Yeah,well,they can't do a shooting
review until we've processed the scene.

09:37.506 --> 09:40.551
I got a bad feeling about this,calleigh.

09:43.137 --> 09:45.055
I better get in there.

09:45.931 --> 09:47.766
You call me if you need me.

09:47.808 --> 09:49.268
I appreciate it.

09:55.232 --> 09:56.692
That mob did such a
number on this scene,

09:56.734 --> 09:58.486
I can't even find
tripp's expended casings.

09:58.527 --> 10:00.946
All this is either useless
or it's compromised.

10:00.988 --> 10:02.656
All right,well,let's start with
what we know- the vehicles.

10:02.698 --> 10:04.742
We know that the pickup
truck hit the bus.

10:04.783 --> 10:08.579
And dispatch called and said that
eyewitnesses saw a red suv flee the scene.

10:11.707 --> 10:15.252
so maybe we can find some
sort of evidence of that.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.467
You know what? As a matter of fact,

10:21.509 --> 10:23.052
I got some red substance on the bumper.

10:23.093 --> 10:24.136
Looks like paint.

10:24.178 --> 10:28.224
Okay,maybe our... red suv
clipped this on its way out.

10:28.265 --> 10:28.891
I'm gonna call horatio.

10:28.933 --> 10:30.768
He's gonna want to know the
color of the getaway vehicle.

10:30.810 --> 10:31.644
Okay.

10:53.374 --> 10:55.125
Hey,natalia.

10:59.004 --> 11:01.298
You know you can't be here. Right?

11:01.340 --> 11:02.550
Oh,come on,don't shoot.

11:02.591 --> 11:04.927
I come in peace here,all right?

11:05.052 --> 11:06.470
So listen.

11:07.471 --> 11:09.849
Guy named rich caprioto.

11:10.141 --> 11:11.517
Oh,that's the guy from the firing range?

11:11.559 --> 11:12.893
That's right,he's a real gunslinger,

11:12.977 --> 11:17.106
and he's willing to meet
with you,uh,this afternoon.

11:17.773 --> 11:22.570
Oh,well,I'M... I'm really busy.

11:24.446 --> 11:26.740
natalia,I really went
out on a limb here.

11:26.782 --> 11:29.827
I mean,this guy's
willing to do it for free.

11:31.203 --> 11:34.915
- okay,well,if-if I
can,I-I will,okay? - Okay.

11:34.957 --> 11:36.292
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

11:36.333 --> 11:37.793
Really,th-
okay.

11:37.835 --> 11:38.544
Good luck.

11:45.426 --> 11:46.886
Lieutenant caine.

11:52.516 --> 11:54.685
You made the right decision,kyle.

11:54.727 --> 11:56.645
Look,I only ran to get
away from those guys,okay?

11:56.687 --> 11:57.938
Julio and the other two.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.857
Did you see where they went?

11:59.899 --> 12:02.234
Well,I saw them leaving in a blue suv.

12:02.318 --> 12:04.612
Okay,'cause the witnesses said red suv.

12:04.653 --> 12:07.114
I'm just telling you what I saw,okay?

12:07.406 --> 12:09.241
Yeah,I believe you.

12:10.993 --> 12:12.203
look,I know this might sound weird,

12:12.244 --> 12:16.999
but if I go to jail,I
want you to walk me in.

12:18.959 --> 12:21.420
- We need to make a stop first.
- What do you mean?

12:21.462 --> 12:22.922
Get in. Trust me.

13:03.254 --> 13:07.883
Inside,you keep your eyes to
yourself and don't look for trouble.

13:07.925 --> 13:12.513
If it finds you- and it will-
you don't back down,no matter what.

13:12.555 --> 13:14.765
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

13:14.807 --> 13:15.724
What did I just say?

13:15.766 --> 13:17.643
Don't back down no matter what.

13:17.685 --> 13:19.979
Okay,there's one more thing. Come here.

13:35.035 --> 13:36.203
You ready?

13:36.871 --> 13:38.038
Yeah.

13:38.581 --> 13:39.999
Let's go.

13:46.714 --> 13:48.299
How you doing?

13:48.382 --> 13:52.178
This is as innocent as a victim gets.

13:52.219 --> 13:53.387
How so?

13:53.429 --> 13:55.264
Check this out.

13:56.724 --> 13:57.725
I don't understand.

13:57.766 --> 13:59.393
Her head is magnetized?

13:59.435 --> 14:00.436
Steel plate?

14:00.478 --> 14:01.812
It's a cochlear implant.

14:01.854 --> 14:05.941
Helps deaf people to receive
and process speech and sounds.

14:07.985 --> 14:11.113
It's surgically implanted
into the inner ear.

14:11.363 --> 14:13.616
It consists of a receiver that decodes,

14:13.657 --> 14:18.162
then transmits to an electrode
array,sending a signal to the brain.

14:21.207 --> 14:23.292
Wouldn't there be an external component?

14:23.334 --> 14:26.629
Oh,she must have lost
it before she was shot.

14:32.426 --> 14:34.053
well,that explains why she
didn't get out of there.

14:34.094 --> 14:36.180
She had no idea what was going on.

14:36.263 --> 14:39.892
Doubt that will help
ease tripp's conscience.

14:39.975 --> 14:41.268
No.

14:41.310 --> 14:42.812
Have you got any firearms evidence?

14:42.853 --> 14:43.938
Yeah.

14:43.979 --> 14:48.025
Recovered it from between the
third and fourth vertebrae.

14:49.401 --> 14:52.029
You know what? This might ease his mind.

14:52.112 --> 14:53.155
It's a. 45.

14:53.197 --> 14:55.324
Tripp only shoots a nine mil.

14:55.407 --> 14:57.284
So,tripp didn't shoot anyone?

14:57.326 --> 14:57.952
No.

14:57.993 --> 15:00.454
Hey,you want to call him,since you
were the one who found the round?

15:00.496 --> 15:01.413
Yeah.

15:02.581 --> 15:05.376
Hey,where are you going
with my projectile?

15:05.417 --> 15:08.170
To find out whose gun
this really came from.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.351
what's all this for?

15:22.434 --> 15:24.436
Standard operating procedure.

15:24.478 --> 15:25.771
For what?

15:25.813 --> 15:27.731
Murder of veronica eckland.

15:27.773 --> 15:31.443
Deaf girl,was an innocent bystander
at a jail bus breakout earlier today.

15:31.485 --> 15:35.281
A round from your. 45 has
ended up inside our victim.

15:35.322 --> 15:37.616
Wait. I was nowhere near that thing.

15:37.658 --> 15:38.868
Really?

15:39.326 --> 15:41.245
You have some fresh cuts on your hands.

15:41.287 --> 15:42.830
Are you sure you didn't
get caught up in the riot?

15:42.872 --> 15:44.498
'Cause we have a couple
of great witnesses.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.792
We could put you in a lineup.

15:48.961 --> 15:50.087
Okay.

15:50.129 --> 15:52.423
I heard about it on the news.

15:52.465 --> 15:55.843
This julio guy who was leading the parade was
yelling something about paying two million,

15:55.885 --> 15:57.595
whoever could bust him out.

15:57.636 --> 15:59.263
And you just happened to be in the area?

15:59.305 --> 16:01.140
For two million? You bet I was.

16:01.182 --> 16:02.475
When I rolled up,the
place was going off.

16:02.516 --> 16:04.059
They had the bus surrounded.

16:04.101 --> 16:05.853
I sneaked my bike up for a closer look.

16:05.895 --> 16:07.688
That's when I lost my gun.

16:20.326 --> 16:21.660
You see who picked your gun up?

16:21.702 --> 16:22.912
No.

16:22.995 --> 16:23.787
People were going crazy.

16:23.829 --> 16:25.414
I got out of there.

16:25.498 --> 16:29.418
Did you see julithand o e two
other fugitives leave in an suv?

16:29.502 --> 16:32.129
No,but I saw one of
them leave on my bike.

16:32.171 --> 16:33.839
They stole your motorcycle?

16:33.881 --> 16:35.549
Did you report it?

16:35.674 --> 16:38.302
If I did that,I'bed
the joke of south beach.

16:38.344 --> 16:39.804
We're talking about
two dangerous felons.

16:39.845 --> 16:42.056
Do you see me laughing?

16:42.890 --> 16:46.101
Attention,miami-dade units for
a stolen motorcycle broadcast.

16:46.143 --> 16:48.145
The vehicle is a 2007 harley-davidson.

16:48.187 --> 16:48.979
Black in color.

16:49.021 --> 16:52.233
Florida plate
4-5-5-1-4-0.

16:52.274 --> 16:54.819
Last seen in the area
of biscayne boulevard.

16:58.697 --> 17:00.991
oscar monahan,hold it right there.

17:01.033 --> 17:02.201
Oh,my god,thank god,man.

17:02.243 --> 17:03.702
You know how long I've
been waiting on y'all?

17:03.744 --> 17:05.829
You ain't never around when
a brother needs you,man.

17:05.871 --> 17:07.790
Right,and you just happened
to walk away from a motorcycle

17:07.832 --> 17:10.041
that was stolen from the
site of a bus breakout.

17:10.084 --> 17:10.960
What you talk...? The bike...

17:11.001 --> 17:12.502
man,I don't know
nothing about that bike.

17:12.545 --> 17:15.214
Look,why don't you just tell us where your
partners,julio and trevor,are hiding out,

17:15.256 --> 17:16.423
and we might be able to help you?

17:16.464 --> 17:17.967
Look,I ain't got no partners.

17:18.008 --> 17:20.426
And like I said,I don't
know nothing about no bike.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.516
look at that.

17:25.641 --> 17:28.602
Didn't we luck out that you
didn't throw those far enough?

17:35.025 --> 17:36.861
you better get a comb,oscar.

17:36.944 --> 17:39.321
You're getting ready to get
a whole new set of mug shots.

17:39.363 --> 17:40.531
Come on.

17:41.907 --> 17:44.160
hey,frank,look,I got to get
some time in at the range,

17:44.201 --> 17:45.953
'cause I've got to prep
for my firearms qualies.

17:45.995 --> 17:46.537
All right.

17:46.579 --> 17:48.330
I'll put oscar in a radio
car and wait for the tow.

17:48.372 --> 17:49.498
Go do what you have to do.

17:49.582 --> 17:50.666
- All right,thanks.
- Yeah.

18:04.555 --> 18:05.389
hey,natalia.

18:05.431 --> 18:06.140
Hi.

18:06.182 --> 18:06.849
Rich caprioto.

18:06.891 --> 18:07.600
Nice to meet you.

18:07.641 --> 18:11.187
Ryan says that you are the
best,so I'm hoping you can help me.

18:11.604 --> 18:13.814
Well,I haven't failed a client yet.

18:15.524 --> 18:16.484
okay.

18:16.525 --> 18:17.443
Send one across the bow.

18:17.485 --> 18:18.736
Okay.

18:18.819 --> 18:21.071
Any... any pointers before I do this?

18:21.113 --> 18:25.242
Yeah,be on time,especially when
someone's doing you a favor.

18:29.580 --> 18:30.414
yeah,I'm sorry about that.

18:30.456 --> 18:31.790
I'm right in the middle of a case.

18:31.832 --> 18:34.293
Actually have to get some evidence
to the lab right after this.

18:34.335 --> 18:35.377
You left it in your ride?

18:35.419 --> 18:38.130
Yeah. It's a county
vehicle,so it's secure.

18:39.256 --> 18:42.635
well,let's waste what's left in
the magazine,and we'll reschedule.

18:42.676 --> 18:43.761
Copy that.

18:44.303 --> 18:45.846
One quick hint.

18:46.055 --> 18:49.266
Squeeze the trigger,don't jerk it.

18:59.235 --> 19:03.656
Stealing the
motorcycle,oscar,is grand theft.

19:03.697 --> 19:05.574
Look,man,I know the charge,all right?

19:05.616 --> 19:06.784
I've had it before.

19:06.826 --> 19:11.413
Yes,but this is a third
strike for you,isn't it?

19:12.373 --> 19:13.415
So,what you getting at?

19:13.457 --> 19:16.877
I want to know where
julio and trevor are.

19:17.086 --> 19:18.796
Look,man,you got to
understand something.

19:18.838 --> 19:20.131
That bid we was up for?

19:20.172 --> 19:23.801
Look,I might have been with
them,but I was not with them.

19:24.301 --> 19:26.720
That's why I went the other
way when the bus crashed.

19:26.762 --> 19:31.559
My point is,that the theft charge
could be reduced to a misdemeanor.

19:34.603 --> 19:35.646
I'm listening.

19:35.688 --> 19:37.314
You say nothing.

19:37.356 --> 19:39.108
Nothing.

19:39.316 --> 19:41.485
Counsel for the defense.

19:41.610 --> 19:44.238
Counselor,this is an
opportunity for your client.

19:44.321 --> 19:46.574
Hear me out,and yomau y disagree.

19:46.907 --> 19:50.244
I've got an expert witness who will
dispute the legitimacy of any evidence found

19:50.286 --> 19:53.747
in or near the motorcycle
you're accused of stealing.

19:53.956 --> 19:56.167
He's a former csi.

20:00.421 --> 20:04.842
So,this conversation's over.

20:05.384 --> 20:07.845
To be continued,oscar.

20:08.971 --> 20:11.015
Let's talk in lockup.

20:47.968 --> 20:49.428
- hey.
- Hi.

20:54.683 --> 20:59.271
so,listen,I got a court order for
the,uh,evidence in the oscar monahan case.

20:59.313 --> 21:00.189
Yeah.

21:00.231 --> 21:03.150
Yeah,horatio told me that
you're working for the defense.

21:03.234 --> 21:04.610
Yup.

21:04.777 --> 21:07.071
What is that...? How do you think
that's going to get you back in the lab?

21:07.112 --> 21:12.368
Well,being an expert
witness pays $300 an hour.

21:12.618 --> 21:14.453
And I'm broke.

21:14.912 --> 21:16.789
And I know you hate it,so
just let me do my job.

21:16.831 --> 21:18.123
All right.

21:18.165 --> 21:21.127
I found oscar's epis on the key chain,

21:21.210 --> 21:24.547
so he stole the motorcycle
from the jail bus breakout.

21:25.256 --> 21:26.590
You know,how...?

21:27.633 --> 21:29.301
how are you going to
challenge my analysis?

21:29.343 --> 21:32.555
I'm not going to
challenge your analysis.

21:33.389 --> 21:36.142
I'm going to challenge your protocol.

21:37.309 --> 21:38.936
What do you mean?

21:39.979 --> 21:43.858
You didn't take the evidence
straight back to the lab,natalia.

21:44.024 --> 21:48.154
No,because I was running to the range
appointment that you set up for me.

21:51.031 --> 21:52.700
that you set me up for.

21:52.741 --> 21:54.326
What?

21:54.660 --> 21:55.995
You set me up.

21:56.078 --> 21:57.705
Wait. No. Wait a second.

21:57.746 --> 21:59.999
You think I'd actually do that?

22:00.082 --> 22:01.667
Are you kidding?

22:04.128 --> 22:07.339
just get me the evidence
so I can vet it,please.

22:26.775 --> 22:27.902
Thank you.

22:27.943 --> 22:29.487
You may put a fugitive
back out on the street.

22:29.570 --> 22:31.322
You proud of yourself?

22:47.465 --> 22:49.217
Right shoulder to the wall.

22:49.258 --> 22:50.802
Man walking.

22:50.927 --> 22:51.761
Listen up.

22:51.803 --> 22:55.807
When the last three digits of your
booking number are called,step forward.

22:55.848 --> 22:58.017
Jones,787.

22:58.059 --> 22:59.185
787?

22:59.227 --> 23:01.604
787,step up.

23:01.646 --> 23:03.397
Don't worry about your clothes.

23:03.439 --> 23:05.358
The trustees will tag them.

23:05.399 --> 23:07.652
No talking in the print line.

23:10.655 --> 23:13.366
Did you stop by the civilian range
before returning with the evidence?

23:13.407 --> 23:16.118
Yes,but show me where
that's not allowed.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.204
With ryan on the stand,tinhe
minds of the jury...?

23:18.246 --> 23:20.164
Yeah,but this is oscar
monahan's third strike.

23:20.206 --> 23:22.959
He stole a motorcycle to evade capture.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.294
That's incontrovertible.

23:25.378 --> 23:26.462
You screwed up,natalia.

23:26.504 --> 23:28.589
No,I didn'T. I...

23:30.550 --> 23:34.053
I had a friend turn on me.

23:34.303 --> 23:36.139
So return the favor.

23:36.430 --> 23:40.852
We discredit ryan,I may still
have a case against oscar.

23:45.481 --> 23:47.191
I can't do it.

23:47.942 --> 23:51.654
Just give me one negative on wolfe.

23:56.617 --> 23:58.202
I'm sorry.

23:58.995 --> 24:00.580
You should be.

24:00.663 --> 24:02.373
It's your career.

24:09.881 --> 24:13.301
I hear we may not be able to
put oscar on that motorcycle.

24:13.342 --> 24:14.969
Compromised evidence.

24:15.052 --> 24:19.515
So all we have left are trevor and
julio,and they escaped in the red suv.

24:19.557 --> 24:20.433
That's correct.

24:20.475 --> 24:22.310
Except for kyle said that it was blue.

24:22.351 --> 24:23.895
Correct,too.

24:23.936 --> 24:25.104
So one of them is lying?

24:25.146 --> 24:25.730
No.

24:25.771 --> 24:26.814
You're lying?

24:27.273 --> 24:29.984
No,it's a special paint.

24:30.067 --> 24:31.360
It changes colors.

24:31.402 --> 24:32.737
Like a chameleon?

24:32.778 --> 24:34.655
To the naked eye,yes.

24:34.697 --> 24:39.410
Most paint jobs,they have a clear
coating that goes over color layer.

24:43.289 --> 24:45.333
Oh,I see,to give it depth,right?

24:45.374 --> 24:50.713
This paint's second coat is filled with reflective
synthetic flakes that are about one micrometer thick.

24:50.755 --> 24:52.507
It creates a prism effect on the car.

24:52.548 --> 24:55.218
So it refracts a different
color at a different angle.

25:08.356 --> 25:12.443
the product's so new,there's only one place
in south beach that does this kind of work.

25:12.652 --> 25:14.946
Lummus detailing.

25:15.029 --> 25:20.034
I think we ought to take a ride and ask them what
cars they painted blue and red in the last week.

25:21.077 --> 25:22.286
Let's go.

25:28.543 --> 25:29.752
Check it out.

25:51.774 --> 25:53.442
Ah,Mr. Bedford.

25:53.484 --> 25:58.030
You have a pretty unique paint job and lummus
detailing tells us you're a very satisfied customer.

25:58.072 --> 26:01.534
Yeah,well,hard to stay ahead
of the trends in this town.

26:01.617 --> 26:03.703
Gotta do something to stand out.

26:03.744 --> 26:07.123
Like break people out of
jail for an easy payday?

26:07.165 --> 26:11.043
What,that,uh,$2 million
thing I heard about on tv?

26:11.085 --> 26:12.795
I had nothing to do with that.

26:12.837 --> 26:15.590
Paint transfer on the front
of your car says otherwise.

26:15.673 --> 26:17.633
Yeah,so do these.

26:18.384 --> 26:21.721
Looks like you cut the cuffs
off of julio and trevor.

26:27.643 --> 26:34.567
Look,you have to
understand,this is not like me.

26:35.610 --> 26:38.154
You've gote nic ahouse,a nice car.

26:38.321 --> 26:39.697
Doesn't seem like you need the money.

26:39.780 --> 26:41.824
Yes,I do.

26:42.158 --> 26:43.618
My brother is sick.

26:43.701 --> 26:45.244
He needs dialysis.

26:45.328 --> 26:47.955
I heard about that two
million,and i had to go for it.

26:48.039 --> 26:50.666
That's a life-saving amount of money.

26:53.169 --> 26:54.045
Guys,over here.

26:54.086 --> 26:55.046
Over here!

26:55.087 --> 26:56.839
That's two,two million,right?

26:56.881 --> 26:58.591
Man of my word,man,come on.

27:06.933 --> 27:08.976
where's the two million now?

27:31.165 --> 27:33.126
This looks like heroin.

27:33.459 --> 27:34.460
What is this?

27:34.544 --> 27:35.628
That's two million.

27:35.711 --> 27:38.047
Maybe more if you sell it right.

27:38.506 --> 27:40.883
You don't want it,you
don't have to take it.

27:40.967 --> 27:42.718
Get out of here,man.

27:43.678 --> 27:45.972
That's the last I ever saw of them.

27:46.013 --> 27:47.265
Lowlifes.

27:47.306 --> 27:49.809
What am I supposed to do
with a bag of pure heroin?

27:49.892 --> 27:51.352
Go to jail.

27:51.769 --> 27:53.563
Eight to 12.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.273
Let's go.

28:06.325 --> 28:08.536
well,if it's not benedict arnold.

28:09.620 --> 28:11.330
Hi,frank. You look well.

28:11.372 --> 28:12.373
What do you want?

28:12.415 --> 28:15.835
Well,as expert witness in
the oscar monahan theft case,

28:15.918 --> 28:19.338
I have a right to investigate
the alleged crime scene.

28:19.422 --> 28:21.090
- "Alleged"?
- Yeah.

28:21.132 --> 28:23.801
A guy stole a motorcycle
and dumped it here.

28:23.843 --> 28:27.013
Stay outside the perimeter
until I can get you an escort.

28:51.078 --> 28:53.122
oh,uh,frank.

28:54.373 --> 28:55.541
Yeah?

28:57.210 --> 28:59.003
That's a. 45.

28:59.170 --> 29:03.090
Same caliber as the bullet they
pulled out of the deaf girl.

29:03.132 --> 29:03.883
Yeah.

29:03.925 --> 29:05.593
Looks like the joke's on you.

29:05.635 --> 29:07.512
Oscar tossed the murder weapon.

29:17.730 --> 29:20.608
Yeah,listen,I have to follow
this through the processing.

29:20.691 --> 29:23.903
You do that. You're doing a
bang-up job for the defense,wolfe.

29:25.488 --> 29:26.864
That's a nice haircut.

29:26.948 --> 29:27.740
Have a good day.

29:27.782 --> 29:28.741
All right.

29:33.287 --> 29:34.664
Got something.

29:34.747 --> 29:36.666
- Did you already test fire the weapon?
- I did.

29:36.749 --> 29:41.003
Striations confirm the gun oscar tossed
was the one that killed veronica eckland.

29:41.045 --> 29:42.672
I also found soft tissue.

29:42.713 --> 29:44.882
So this is the skin from the. 45?

29:44.924 --> 29:47.385
Yeah,the hammer pinch trapped the skin.

29:51.973 --> 29:56.686
This will tell us who the shooter is.

29:57.311 --> 30:01.190
And then,maybe I can
testify for the defense.

30:01.440 --> 30:02.733
That would be fun.

30:02.775 --> 30:07.363
Listen,natalia,at least consider the fact that
I brought the gun to tripp's attention,will ya?

30:08.030 --> 30:11.450
You want points for
doing the right thing?

30:11.534 --> 30:12.535
Hey.

30:13.161 --> 30:14.453
Hey!

30:15.246 --> 30:20.084
I follow the evidence no
matter who pays me. Okay?

30:20.209 --> 30:22.962
I'm doing my job,I haven't sold my soul.

30:23.004 --> 30:27.550
If oscar's guilty,then
he's guilty. All right?

30:27.592 --> 30:28.384
he isn'T.

30:28.426 --> 30:29.552
What?

30:29.594 --> 30:30.636
He isn't?

30:30.678 --> 30:31.929
It's not his dna.

30:31.971 --> 30:34.932
He ended up with the
gun,but he never used it.

30:35.725 --> 30:37.935
Whose dna is it?

30:40.688 --> 30:45.485
Barry,you claim that you cut
your hands on the pavement...

30:45.568 --> 30:50.156
when in reality,you cut your
hand shooting veronica eckland.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.824
Didn't you?

30:53.701 --> 30:55.077
I know this,barry,

30:55.161 --> 31:02.543
because we recovered your skin from
the hammer of the. 45kihat tller her.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.848
All I could think about
was all that money.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.558
$2 million.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.018
I was trying to get closer to julio.

31:19.060 --> 31:20.520
I saw him on the news.

31:20.603 --> 31:24.357
I cleared a path and she motioned
for him to get into her car.

31:38.412 --> 31:41.290
sorry,dawg,what I need,I take.

31:44.418 --> 31:47.964
Couldn't let her get the two
million and not me,so I shot her.

31:49.257 --> 31:51.843
You said she motioned to julio.

31:51.926 --> 31:54.303
Tatted up guy,goatee.

31:54.846 --> 31:56.264
Yeah.

31:56.430 --> 31:58.432
Thank you,barry. Take him,please.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.228
- Yeah?
- Frank,our victim.

32:02.270 --> 32:03.896
- The deaf girl?
- Yes.

32:03.938 --> 32:06.899
Look into julio's background
and see if there's a connection.

32:06.941 --> 32:08.526
You think she was in
on the bus breakout?

32:08.568 --> 32:10.027
I do now.

32:19.714 --> 32:21.924
Just about to fume these
drug packets for prints,

32:21.966 --> 32:23.468
but I heard you wanted
to see them first.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.929
Chameleon car guy said that
julio gave him the packets,right?

32:26.971 --> 32:29.640
Yeah,as payment for helping
him flee the bus breakout.

32:29.682 --> 32:32.310
If julio was small-time,where'd
he get this amount?

32:32.351 --> 32:34.812
He had to get the heroin
from a third party.

32:34.854 --> 32:37.857
I swabbed the packets for
epithelials,there aren't any.

32:37.899 --> 32:39.901
Not where you're looking.

32:41.944 --> 32:43.237
You see this edge?

32:43.279 --> 32:47.450
It's amorphic,which means it was
sealed by hand,not by machine.

32:48.618 --> 32:50.578
Julio's drug connection is old school.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.955
It's an amateur
process,heat it,squeeze it.

32:52.997 --> 32:57.794
But as air sucks into
the packet,so does skin.

33:16.187 --> 33:17.396
joe lebrock.

33:17.438 --> 33:19.524
Been in dade detention
for the last six months.

33:19.565 --> 33:22.693
He may be locked up,but he still
owns property on the waterfront.

33:22.777 --> 33:24.529
Take a look as his two known associates.

33:24.612 --> 33:27.073
Julio re oriantand trevor battle.

33:27.115 --> 33:28.616
Our two bandits on the run.

33:28.658 --> 33:29.575
That's right.

33:29.617 --> 33:30.910
I'll let horatio know.

33:30.952 --> 33:32.078
Thanks.

33:40.878 --> 33:42.463
This is lebrock's warehouse.

33:42.505 --> 33:44.465
The suspects may be in the vicinity.

33:44.549 --> 33:45.925
Do we have any movement inside yet?

33:45.967 --> 33:47.218
None yet,sir.

33:47.260 --> 33:48.803
What's the plan,lieutenant?

33:48.845 --> 33:50.847
The plan is,is to keep
our eyes up,gentlemen.

33:50.888 --> 33:52.723
Somebody's coming out.

33:53.850 --> 33:54.809
He's got a weapon.

33:54.851 --> 33:55.935
It's one of our escapees.

33:55.977 --> 33:57.395
It's trevor battle.

33:58.312 --> 34:00.940
Hey,trevor,where's julio?

34:00.982 --> 34:02.400
Hey,don't worry about where julio's at.

34:02.442 --> 34:03.526
Why is that?

34:03.568 --> 34:05.319
Man,we got something you really want.

34:05.361 --> 34:07.196
What are you talking about,trevor?

34:07.238 --> 34:08.156
The kid.

34:08.197 --> 34:09.282
What kid?

34:09.322 --> 34:11.451
Kyle. From the bus.

34:11.492 --> 34:13.161
Man,we found out he's your son.

34:13.202 --> 34:15.371
That kid is back in custody,trevor.

34:15.413 --> 34:17.748
Yeah. And that's exactly
where we're gonna kill him.

34:17.790 --> 34:20.501
- trevor
- Take care,lieutenant caine.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.053
yes,uh,this is lieutenant horatio caine.

34:31.094 --> 34:33.723
I am looking for inmate kyle harmon.

34:33.806 --> 34:35.516
Kyle harmon?

34:38.561 --> 34:39.978
I got eyeballs on him now.

34:40.062 --> 34:41.688
Do not let him out of your sight.

34:41.731 --> 34:43.065
Horatio,you were right.

34:43.107 --> 34:45.650
Homicide found o ut the deaf
girl was engaged to julio.

34:45.693 --> 34:46.902
No wonder she tried to break him out.

34:46.944 --> 34:48.821
Frank,she read our lips.

34:48.862 --> 34:51.616
Have you,uh,told kyle he's your son?

34:51.657 --> 34:53.659
I haven't yet.

34:59.874 --> 35:03.503
Outside the courtroom is where
they found out about kyle.

35:09.467 --> 35:11.719
I need a third floor
prowler at main control.

35:11.761 --> 35:12.720
Excuse me.

35:12.762 --> 35:13.638
One second,lieutenant.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.431
Excuse me!

35:16.933 --> 35:18.434
Inmate kyle harmon.

35:18.476 --> 35:19.435
He's a miss-out,lieutenant.

35:19.477 --> 35:20.353
He can't be a miss-out.

35:20.394 --> 35:21.646
I just spoke to you on the phone.

35:21.687 --> 35:22.271
Where is he?

35:22.313 --> 35:23.815
Fight broke out. I had to break it up.

35:23.856 --> 35:24.816
The fight was staged.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.109
Do you monitor the phones?

35:26.150 --> 35:28.402
Absolutely. System logs each
call from the phone bank.

35:28.444 --> 35:29.612
Get me the logs.

35:29.654 --> 35:31.572
And lock this place down,you understand?

35:31.614 --> 35:33.074
Lock it down.

35:38.579 --> 35:40.706
So someone knew that kyle was inside.

35:40.748 --> 35:44.001
It had to be julio rentoria
that tipped them off,eric.

35:44.043 --> 35:47.463
We're looking for security
cameras and phone logs.

35:47.505 --> 35:49.507
All right,outbound phone numbers.

35:49.549 --> 35:51.259
You want me to write a
warrant and get the addresses?

35:51.300 --> 35:53.136
We don't have time.

35:53.302 --> 35:55.054
Hang on. Here you go.

35:55.096 --> 35:56.764
Wow,they're all clearing
out for this guy.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.183
That's what I call respect.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.560
Or fear.

36:00.643 --> 36:02.437
Guy looks pretty hard-core.

36:02.478 --> 36:04.397
Look at the wristband.

36:08.234 --> 36:09.777
Joe lebrock.

36:09.819 --> 36:12.447
That's the same guy whose place
we hit today at the waterfront.

36:12.530 --> 36:13.990
His dna was on the drugs.

36:14.031 --> 36:17.160
Okay,so he's our connection
to rentoria,isn't he?

36:17.243 --> 36:19.287
Julio must have an untraceable phone.

36:19.370 --> 36:21.164
untill now

36:21.205 --> 36:22.957
Track it,eric.

36:23.875 --> 36:25.126
What are you going to do?

36:25.168 --> 36:27.336
I'm going to go talk to joe.

36:35.970 --> 36:38.097
Where's the boy?

36:38.848 --> 36:41.350
You mean your little boy?

36:42.101 --> 36:44.562
I ain't telling you jack.

36:46.189 --> 36:49.984
It looks like somebody
marked you up pretty good,joe.

36:50.401 --> 36:51.986
Did they?

36:53.988 --> 37:00.161
Joe,I am attempting to give you
a chance,so work with me on this.

37:00.995 --> 37:04.207
I don't want it.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.666
Okay.

37:06.125 --> 37:09.420
Then we have a big problem.

37:09.504 --> 37:11.089
Yeah?

37:11.714 --> 37:13.591
And what would that be?

37:13.633 --> 37:18.596
I'm not leaving this
room without an answer.

37:27.682 --> 37:29.100
All right,got it.

37:29.142 --> 37:32.061
Okay. Thanks.

37:32.312 --> 37:36.316
Calleigh said that julio's cell phone
gps is in within a hundred-yard radius.

37:36.357 --> 37:38.276
I'll take the left flank.

37:38.318 --> 37:39.944
All right,let's go.

38:00.465 --> 38:01.424
Julio!

38:01.466 --> 38:03.092
Let's see some hands.

38:06.638 --> 38:07.680
Go ahead.

38:07.722 --> 38:09.432
Take your best shot.

38:09.474 --> 38:12.435
It doesn't work like that,but
I'll make you a promise.

38:12.477 --> 38:14.812
Oh,yeah,5-0,what's that?

38:14.854 --> 38:16.814
You're not going to get away twice.

38:16.856 --> 38:19.192
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,wait.

38:19.233 --> 38:21.069
I got something to deal.

38:21.527 --> 38:22.820
Kyle.

38:22.987 --> 38:24.447
Too late.

38:24.697 --> 38:27.533
Lieutenant caine's got his own methods.

38:28.284 --> 38:29.702
Let's go.

38:33.831 --> 38:37.752
H,yeah,I'm on my way.

38:52.767 --> 38:54.519
What's this?

38:54.852 --> 38:58.231
You know,we rounded up
all your friends,joe.

38:58.940 --> 39:00.566
Where's the boy?

39:14.956 --> 39:17.250
Ever been to brazil,joe?

39:18.418 --> 39:19.961
What?

39:21.754 --> 39:30.847
Not long ago,someone that we both cared for
greatly was killed by an animal like you.

39:31.889 --> 39:36.561
We went down to brazil to hunt him.

39:37.270 --> 39:40.231
He never left the country,joe.

39:42.859 --> 39:45.403
So what's that gotta do with me?

39:46.237 --> 39:54.120
If those scratches are from my son
and anything has happened to him,

39:54.162 --> 39:59.792
I'm going to come back to this
room and you will leave it in a bag.

40:01.044 --> 40:05.089
So,I'm going to ask you one more time.

40:05.173 --> 40:06.924
Where is he?

40:12.472 --> 40:15.141
He's in the pipe chase.

40:15.224 --> 40:18.853
Maintenance hallway between the cells.

40:19.479 --> 40:21.272
Block C.

40:42.168 --> 40:43.336
kyle!

40:43.711 --> 40:44.921
Kyle!

40:49.092 --> 40:50.134
kyle.

40:59.852 --> 41:01.145
kyle.

41:02.897 --> 41:04.482
I did what you said. I fought back.

41:04.524 --> 41:06.109
I know you did,son.

41:06.150 --> 41:07.485
I know you did.

41:07.568 --> 41:08.569
Why are you doing this?

41:08.611 --> 41:10.488
I'm doing this,kyle...

41:10.571 --> 41:13.241
because I'm your father,okay.

41:14.617 --> 41:15.910
You... what?

41:15.952 --> 41:18.538
I know you don't believe me,and
we can't talk about it now.

41:18.579 --> 41:20.248
But we will. Come on.

41:20.290 --> 41:24.419
We've got to get you back and keep
you away from the general population.

41:31.676 --> 41:34.053
Could I have a minute,please,gentlemen?

41:35.888 --> 41:37.890
Heard you got my third
strike kicked back.

41:37.932 --> 41:39.976
As a matter of fact I did,oscar.

41:40.018 --> 41:43.104
We all know there's no such thing as
a free lunch,so what do I gotta do?

41:43.146 --> 41:44.522
There was a kid on the bus.

41:44.564 --> 41:47.191
I don't want anything
to happen to him inside.

41:47.275 --> 41:48.276
What are you talking about,protect him?

41:48.318 --> 41:50.695
24/7- that's
your mission now.

41:50.737 --> 41:52.905
Hey,feel me,man,I can't
be with him all the time.

41:52.947 --> 41:54.449
Pass the word,oscar.

41:54.490 --> 41:57.410
That kid is untouchable from here on in.

41:57.452 --> 41:58.870
You understand?

42:01.164 --> 42:02.290
All right,you got a deal.

42:02.373 --> 42:03.249
Your boy is safe.

42:03.291 --> 42:05.835
And,oscar,if anything happens to him...

42:05.877 --> 42:07.128
I'm on my third strike.

42:07.170 --> 42:07.754
There you go.

42:07.795 --> 42:09.130
You're a smart man.

42:09.172 --> 42:10.715
Take him.
