WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.968
Jess, are you okay?

00:02.970 --> 00:05.838
Honey, you just fled to your
dad's house in Portland.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.606
What I did was a very tasteful,

00:07.608 --> 00:10.009
very understated skedaddle

00:10.011 --> 00:12.511
so I could get some much needed
space from Nick, and it worked.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.645
I'm fine.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.646
So, you're coming back?

00:14.648 --> 00:15.848
I would, but...

00:15.850 --> 00:17.049
Ashley's out of town,

00:17.051 --> 00:18.183
and the man doesn't do well
without his wife.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.651
I can't in good conscience

00:19.653 --> 00:21.053
leave my elderly father here

00:21.055 --> 00:22.488
without someone to help him

00:22.490 --> 00:25.057
steam-clean
his bowling trophies.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.892
Hey, Jess.
I think you should go home.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.061
Shut up, TV!
That was the TV.

00:29.063 --> 00:29.962
Hello?

00:29.964 --> 00:31.830
Go home? I just got here.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.165
And I-I love that.

00:33.167 --> 00:36.068
I love a surprise visit
for no reason at all.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.369
We had fun,

00:37.371 --> 00:40.039
but don't you think it's now,
it's time for you to, you know,

00:40.041 --> 00:42.674
get back to your life.

00:42.676 --> 00:43.976
Dad, you still need me.

00:43.978 --> 00:45.244
I mean...

00:45.246 --> 00:48.380
we really half-assed
those trophies!

00:48.382 --> 00:50.382
What? Th-They look great.
Look. Oh, this one.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.584
This one is fantastic.
See this one?

00:52.586 --> 00:55.020
This is the ball
that I won that trophy with.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.855
This ball right here.
Helen, I call...

00:56.857 --> 00:58.924
Oh! Dad!
(screaming)

00:58.926 --> 01:00.926
I-I waxed the holes.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.061
You waxed the holes?!

01:02.063 --> 01:03.662
Was I-I not supposed to?

01:03.664 --> 01:05.697
Not wise! Not wise!

01:05.699 --> 01:07.166
It's okay.
(whimpering)

01:07.168 --> 01:08.934
I'm right here,

01:08.936 --> 01:11.537
and I'm not going anywhere.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.938
(grunts)

01:12.940 --> 01:14.740
♪ ♪

01:17.178 --> 01:19.011
Oh, I'm so nervous
to meet your mom.

01:19.013 --> 01:20.946
I'm bad with
women and family.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.748
I wish she was a male stranger.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.116
NICK: You guys talking
about Charmaine?

01:24.118 --> 01:25.517
Yeah, my mom.
Charmaine is

01:25.519 --> 01:27.352
a tough lady.
My mom is

01:27.354 --> 01:29.188
just protective, okay?
My dad walked out on us

01:29.190 --> 01:30.689
when I was a baby.
I am her only son.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.524
Hey!

01:32.526 --> 01:33.525
What are you guys
doing here?

01:33.527 --> 01:35.260
Rude.
What are we doing here?

01:35.262 --> 01:36.795
Yeah, what are you doing here?
Why are you here?
What,

01:36.797 --> 01:39.364
just because we moved, we have
to justify our presence here?

01:39.366 --> 01:40.732
Well, you don't live here, so...

01:40.734 --> 01:42.401
We're allowed to be here
for no reason at all.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.736
Oh, I get it. You're sad
and lonely in your new house

01:44.738 --> 01:45.771
and you miss us.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.773
We do not need this.
If anything,

01:47.775 --> 01:50.142
you-you people need us.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.045
We are married homeowners.
Benefit from our wisdom.

01:53.047 --> 01:55.080
Okay! I got to go.

01:55.082 --> 01:58.117
Aly and I have
an invited guest to plan for.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.118
Oh.
NICK:
Good burn, Winston.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.919
You're getting better at those.
Thanks, man!

02:00.921 --> 02:02.421
Okay, I am off to my drug party.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.057
Reagan's, uh, pharm rep crew
is in town for a convention.

02:05.059 --> 02:08.260
Have fun. If you get too drunk
to drive, call me,

02:08.262 --> 02:10.062
'cause I will be, too,
and we can be twins.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.597
Wait, you're not going?

02:11.599 --> 02:12.631
Don't you
want to meet

02:12.633 --> 02:13.966
Reagan's friends?

02:13.968 --> 02:16.235
Mm, we never really talked
about it.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.903
Seems like something
that a married homeowner

02:17.905 --> 02:20.005
should weigh in on.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.106
How could you not talk about
such a major relationship step?

02:22.109 --> 02:24.409
Ugh, because we're not
all couple-y like you guys are.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.445
We don't talk
about every little tiny...

02:26.447 --> 02:28.347
We don't gab all day like
a couple of Italian grandmas

02:28.349 --> 02:29.314
hanging their laundry.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.249
SCHMIDT:
Talking is

02:30.251 --> 02:32.184
the lifeblood of
a relationship.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.820
Truth.
The problem is,
is neither one of you

02:34.822 --> 02:36.121
wants to take
the initiative.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.623
You're both
communication bottoms.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.092
One of you needs
to be the top.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.460
What does this have anything
to do with hamburger buns?

02:41.462 --> 02:44.096
Look, we do things in
our own way, right?

02:44.098 --> 02:46.098
It's not like I don't want Nick
to come with me.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.299
And for the record, I would love
to meet your friends.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.133
That would be great.

02:48.135 --> 02:51.103
So...

02:52.173 --> 02:53.472
All right, I'm going!

02:53.474 --> 02:55.040
Get off my back!

02:57.344 --> 02:58.343
So what are you guys doing here?

02:58.345 --> 03:01.113
Never. Never
in my entire life.
Okay.

03:01.115 --> 03:04.216
Never. Never.
My blood built this loft.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.718
Maybe as an icebreaker
we tell your mom about the time

03:06.720 --> 03:09.488
we actually arrested
Jay Leno for jaywalking.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.691
One small thing--
it's a footnote, really--

03:12.693 --> 03:14.693
my mom don't know I'm a cop.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.928
What?

03:16.897 --> 03:18.163
Winston, why?

03:18.165 --> 03:20.165
She's a-a protective single mom.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.134
She's always freaked out
at the tiniest thing.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.670
My baby! I turn my
head for one second.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.673
Lord, where is my baby?! Wh...

03:27.675 --> 03:29.141
I went to look
at bikes.

03:29.143 --> 03:31.076
Oh!

03:31.078 --> 03:32.744
She still thinks
I'm in sports radio.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.047
I still record
shows for her.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.882
You got to promise
not to blow my cover.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.084
Wait, what are you doing?
I have so much
police stuff.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.353
Now, I realize you're
getting caught up in a lie

03:41.355 --> 03:43.889
against your will, but...

03:43.891 --> 03:45.691
my mom is coming
to see you, okay?

03:45.693 --> 03:47.526
It won't even come up.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.861
But if it does,
you're my producer.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.530
Bishop!

03:51.532 --> 03:52.864
I'm-a hide that.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.166
I love him, I love him,
I love him,

03:54.168 --> 03:55.200
I love him, I love him...

03:55.202 --> 03:57.102
Pretty slim pickings
at the drugstore.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.837
All I got was, uh,
<i> Freckle Me Once:</i>

03:58.839 --> 04:00.906
<i> The Unauthorized</i>
<i> Lindsay Lohan Story.</i>

04:00.908 --> 04:02.274
Anyway, I got
all your stuff--

04:02.276 --> 04:03.609
your bandages,
your hydrogen peroxide,

04:03.611 --> 04:04.943
your gummy peaches...

04:04.945 --> 04:06.545
You're making too big a fuss out
of this.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.347
I mean, I've had so much worse.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.282
This is just a bruised toe.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.950
It's your index toe.
Very serious.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.752
That's the toe you point with.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.621
You've been great to me.
You've taken care of me.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.290
Now I'm gonna do something
for you.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.392
I'm gonna get you a ticket.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.028
Oh, here it is.
Portland to L.A.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.031
Dad, I am not leaving
you like this.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.966
Recovery is the most vulnerable
part of the process,

04:27.968 --> 04:31.036
and this house is full of
stairs and sharp corners.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.938
And you know how
slippery your bathtub is.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.973
I won't stand up!
I'll just roll out!

04:34.975 --> 04:38.677
Dad, I'm sorry, but I need
to show you a little tough love.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.512
Get in bed.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.814
Do it.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.952
"She was born
on the freakiest of Fridays..."

04:46.954 --> 04:49.288
Okay, we're in 42 markets,
big show coming up

04:49.290 --> 04:51.623
with Stephen A's brother
Stephen B,
B.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.293
our lead-in is a cooking show
called<i> The Ugly Dumpling...</i>

04:54.295 --> 04:55.294
So funny.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.728
Hey, is all of this necessary?

04:56.730 --> 04:57.996
That's just in case it comes up.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.231
Which, like I said...
(chuckles)

04:59.233 --> 05:01.266
it won't.
Mm...

05:01.268 --> 05:02.501
I feel like it might.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.835
Mother-in-law troubles, huh?

05:03.837 --> 05:05.137
Second mom drahm?

05:05.139 --> 05:06.505
Hey, seriously,
why are you still here?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.307
That's your most pressing
question right now?

05:08.309 --> 05:10.309
Not why did I sign up
for this ill-advised

05:10.311 --> 05:12.411
talk radio
alternative reality?

05:12.413 --> 05:13.612
Guys, we're trying to prep,
okay?

05:13.614 --> 05:14.680
So if you're gonna be
in our home,

05:14.682 --> 05:16.415
please, step back from the mic.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.284
That's radio lingo for when
someone's on the microphone

05:19.286 --> 05:21.186
and you don't want
them to be; you say,

05:21.188 --> 05:22.854
"Step away from..."
I got it.
CHARMAINE: Baby!

05:22.856 --> 05:24.156
You are a radio personality!

05:24.158 --> 05:27.092
You just can't leave
your front door open

05:27.094 --> 05:29.661
for any ol' Menendez
brothers to walk into.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.699
Ooh...!
(chuckling)

05:33.701 --> 05:36.301
(grunts, chuckles)

05:36.303 --> 05:38.103
This is Aly.
Hey!

05:38.105 --> 05:41.039
Long time listener,
first time visitor.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.607
Oh.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

05:42.609 --> 05:44.609
Radio. She
referenced radio.

05:44.611 --> 05:47.946
Uh, yeah, Mom, you know, we talk
about work all day long, so...

05:47.948 --> 05:49.715
Well, it's not work
when it's with your girl.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.316
Now, Aly, tell me,

05:51.318 --> 05:54.319
do you two ever sing
the call letters

05:54.321 --> 05:55.987
to each other to fall asleep?

05:55.989 --> 05:57.622
Mm-Mm-hmm.

05:57.624 --> 05:58.690
Yep.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.093
♪ KQWP... ♪

06:02.062 --> 06:03.128
Oh, I thought
you two moved.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.069
(whistles)

06:11.071 --> 06:13.305
Whoa, drug companies
have a lot of money.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.342
Well, this is great.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.745
I feel like you finally
brought me to your home planet.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.913
Yeah. I'm really glad you came.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.248
All right. So tell me about

06:23.250 --> 06:25.083
these pharm reps
I'm about to meet.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.319
I mean, I don't know what I can
really tell you about them.

06:27.321 --> 06:29.755
We sort of became friends
at these conventions,

06:29.757 --> 06:32.190
and we go from city to city
with each other.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.992
It's kind of like
camp friends?

06:33.994 --> 06:37.329
Except everybody's, uh,
slept together a whole lot.

06:37.331 --> 06:39.931
It's exactly
like camp friends, I guess.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.867
All these people have
had sex with each other?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.568
Mostly, yeah.
Mostly. And with you?

06:43.570 --> 06:46.705
You had sex with the...
Yeah? Why wouldn't you?

06:46.707 --> 06:49.941
Yeah.
Oh, you guys are like groupies,
but for yourself. I dig it.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.711
Are we gonna have to, like,
talk this out right now? Or...

06:52.713 --> 06:54.513
I'm good. Are you good?
Yeah.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.181
I'm cool.
Okay.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.917
Ah, I'm not a talker.
Talking's not my thing.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.118
Great. This is why we work.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.186
'Cause we're not
like Schmidt and Cece.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.188
We don't have to write
each other a love poem

07:03.190 --> 07:04.856
every time I go
into the other room.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.391
Oh, pass.
JACK:
Reags.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.560
Hey.
Hey.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.961
How are you?
Oh.
Oh.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.764
(laughs)
Off the ground.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.201
Jack.
I'm Nick and I-I might
win a raffle tonight.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.936
(laughing)

07:21.308 --> 07:23.542
So, Reagan, you gonna save me
a pas de deux tonight?

07:23.544 --> 07:25.444
Okay.
(laughter)

07:25.446 --> 07:27.145
What's going on?
What are you guys laughing at?

07:27.147 --> 07:28.613
I don't get the joke.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.981
Well, you do know that she was

07:29.983 --> 07:31.383
a professionally trained
ballet dancer?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.387
You never told me
you were a ballerina.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.422
I sort of shattered both
of my ankles in this thing

07:37.424 --> 07:39.257
I refer to as
"The Crackening."

07:39.259 --> 07:41.092
Your ankles?
Like, both your ankles?

07:41.094 --> 07:43.161
And both of my knees
and a little bit of my pelvis.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.564
What?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.332
I could be the Queen of Egypt

07:47.334 --> 07:49.000
and your mom wouldn't know,
because all she wants to do

07:49.002 --> 07:51.403
is talk about the radio
show that doesn't exist.

07:51.405 --> 07:53.438
That's on me.
Maybe I should have made

07:53.440 --> 07:55.474
my fake radio show
less intriguing.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.075
It's 7:12 and you know
what that means.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.811
Traffic on the 12 with Linda.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.179
(clears throat)

08:01.181 --> 08:03.448
(higher voice): It's just way
too much damn traffic out here.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.616
I can't get to work.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.984
(laughs)
Linda.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.153
Your big ass on the bus,
stop playing.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.155
Babe, how will I ever
break through to your mom

08:10.157 --> 08:11.923
if I keep lying to her?
This is crazy.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.625
That's on me, too.
I know it's on you.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.993
You're the only person
it could be on.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.195
And that is my bad.
I know it's your bad.

08:17.197 --> 08:21.132
Aly. You have seven identical
stripe long sleeve shirts?

08:21.134 --> 08:22.834
Yeah. I-I know it's strange.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.302
Um, it-it was a deal.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.670
Oh.
Buy five, get two free.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.639
You still got the receipt?
Of course I do.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.775
BB Taxx has the same items,
four for $20.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.211
Wait. Are you a DDS?

08:33.213 --> 08:35.547
DDS since '73.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.948
What? Are you both
secret dentists?

08:36.950 --> 08:39.384
CHARMAINE AND ALY:
Deep discount shoppers.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.153
Ooh.
OG price, $350.98.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.656
Uh-huh.
BB Taxx price, $72.99

08:44.658 --> 08:47.959
CHARMAINE:
Ooh.
$72.99!

08:47.961 --> 08:51.830
And someone didn't limit their
price match to California.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.965
Arkansas prices, y'all.
What do you say

08:53.967 --> 08:55.700
we get back in our cubbies

08:55.702 --> 08:58.470
and keep this
fashion show going.
Okay.

08:58.472 --> 08:59.838
I don't know why I'm just
putting this together,

08:59.840 --> 09:02.173
but you two are very cheap.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.142
You're about to feel
You don't know what
you're talking about.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.711
my cheap purse on your temple.
You do not know.
Easy now.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.980
What do you think, Nick?
Should she take it?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.716
Take what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.717
Reagan's big promotion.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.153
Her promotion?

09:15.155 --> 09:17.088
Should she take it?
I never...

09:17.090 --> 09:20.091
I didn't hear about it
until right now.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.027
It's just VP of
North American sales.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.862
VP?
It's not a big deal.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.764
It's just like a heartbeat
away from the president

09:25.766 --> 09:27.332
of North American sales, so...

09:27.334 --> 09:29.401
Seems like a pretty big deal.
Reagan, it's huge.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.170
You get to travel all the time.
So many hotel points.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.005
Mo' points, mo' problems,
that's what I always say.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.574
It's exciting
finding out this way.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.375
Most people would probably
tell their boyfriend

09:37.377 --> 09:40.579
when they first found out
about it, but that's cool.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.514
We don't talk, that's why
we work, and that's cool...

09:42.516 --> 09:44.583
And, uh, I'm really
bothered by this.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.718
Nick.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.787
(gasps)

09:54.695 --> 09:55.794
(ringtone plays)

10:01.435 --> 10:02.767
Hey, Jess, it's me again.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.202
Sorry to call you again.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.772
I just, I just really wish
you would call me back.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.574
I'm having a problem,

10:09.576 --> 10:11.610
and I feel like you really
like when I'm,

10:11.612 --> 10:13.144
you know, I'm having a problem.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.280
Not that you,
not that you like it, but,

10:15.282 --> 10:17.716
but that-that you like,
you like talking about it.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.751
Anyway, I'm just
coming apart here.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.721
I'm-I'm really a hundred percent
falling apart,

10:22.723 --> 10:25.290
and I really wish
you would call me back.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.158
(phone beeps)
All right.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.227
Hey, Schmidty, what's up?

10:29.229 --> 10:31.496
Just checking in.
Okay.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.797
(phone beeps)
Oh, hold on, I got another call.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.733
All of a sudden
my phone's blowing up.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.967
Hi. This is Nick Miller.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.736
Who am I speaking to
and why are you calling?

10:37.738 --> 10:39.437
Do you not have my number saved?
Who is this?

10:39.439 --> 10:40.972
Who is<i> this?</i>
Who am I speaking to?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.174
It's... it's Cece.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.309
Cece, why are you both
calling me?

10:44.311 --> 10:46.244
How do you not have
my number saved? I work for you.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.146
Cece, I already got Nick.
Let me patch you in.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.981
How am I supposed to learn to do
a patch if you never let me try?

10:49.983 --> 10:53.184
Nick, as the only person who
takes our advice, how you doing?

10:53.186 --> 10:55.687
Well, you were right.
Reagan and I never talk.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.123
We helped you.
Cece, we helped him.
I know, I heard.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.758
No. You messed everything up.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.359
You stupid idiots
made me realize

11:01.361 --> 11:03.094
that I need more than that.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.829
Now I got to go back
to this party

11:04.831 --> 11:06.865
with her friends and pretend
like it doesn't bother me.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.634
Those look fantastic.
CECE: Oh, honey,
that sounds so rough.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.136
I said ho-- one second, my man.

11:11.138 --> 11:14.139
In the middle of
a conversation.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.207
(Beethoven's
"Moonlight Sonata" plays)

11:25.018 --> 11:26.885
Dad, I know you got out of bed.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.286
No, I-I didn't, I didn't.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.188
I-I-I've been,
I've been sleeping.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.025
I found these little crummies
in the kitchen.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.994
You only gave me
a salad and tea.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.896
I-I-I-I wanted some fish sticks.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.065
Fish sticks are mostly pork
and you know it.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.233
Now, I'm gonna trim your nails.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.969
Oh, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.038
Uh, uh, uh, it's-it's
a little too short.
(clippers snap)

11:47.040 --> 11:50.308
It's too-- Ow, ow!
(screaming)

11:50.310 --> 11:52.010
I have a good thing going
with your mom right now,

11:52.012 --> 11:53.578
and I don't want to ruin that.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.979
We should just
tell her the truth.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.048
CECE:
Hey-o! Problem alert.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.017
Well, if you need help, you've
come to the right place.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.820
Share, share. Please. Tell us
what seems to be the problem.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.188
Here's what you're doing,
and it's not okay.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.989
You're inserting yourself
into a family matter.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.558
We can handle
this on our own.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.093
We're here if you need us.
Yeah, watch your front,

12:08.095 --> 12:09.260
'cause we've got your back.
We got your back.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.096
I just want you to know
that I respect that.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.098
I'm perceiving that.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.433
Um, I'm digesting that.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.268
It's in the machine.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.504
It's working its way down.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.006
And okay.
I think you're right.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.274
I think it'll
be really good

12:23.276 --> 12:25.076
for you to be honest
with your mom.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.078
No. See, um,
you're gonna come clean.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.546
I'm gonna stay dirty.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.715
Why?
CHARMAINE: Aly, I
found a roly-poly

12:30.717 --> 12:33.752
in these pants, they
gave me 89% off.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.786
Oh.
(laughs)

12:34.788 --> 12:36.087
That's sweet.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.023
Um, Charmaine, I have
to tell you something.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.962
I don't work in radio, I don't.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.831
I'm actually a cop.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.602
What?

12:50.604 --> 12:53.104
Man, you wearing a wire?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.739
Okay.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.541
(whispering):
Sorry.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.345
Well, I appreciate you
telling me the truth.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.816
The job is dangerous.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.051
But I do salute your courage.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.859
(exhales)
Okay. Um...

13:16.963 --> 13:18.396
You can salute me, too.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.098
'Cause, uh,

13:20.100 --> 13:21.966
I'm also a cop.
What?!

13:21.968 --> 13:23.601
Uh, uh, uh,
I'm-I'm not a super successful

13:23.603 --> 13:25.069
morning radio shock jock.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.771
There's no radio show?
No.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.673
I'm a... I'm an officer
of the law.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.141
What?!
That's not

13:30.143 --> 13:31.976
how you reacted when Aly said
she was a cop.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.646
Being a parent is like wearing
your heart outside your body,

13:34.648 --> 13:37.415
and now you're telling me
that my heart

13:37.417 --> 13:40.151
is on these streets by himself?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.620
Sampling drugs with a knife

13:42.622 --> 13:44.022
to see if it's really cocaine?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.423
My heart

13:45.425 --> 13:48.193
knows what cocaine tastes like?

13:51.431 --> 13:53.131
Oh, man.
(door slams)

13:53.133 --> 13:54.265
That's on you, man.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.600
Please shut up.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.168
REAGAN:
It isn't a dream job.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.603
Sure, it comes
with a great salary

13:58.605 --> 14:00.338
and a vaccination
for the coming elk flu.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.173
The flu that you're
gonna be hearing about

14:02.175 --> 14:03.441
for the next decade.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.876
But it also requires
too much travel,

14:04.878 --> 14:06.211
and I'm gonna turn it down.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.847
Are you happy now?
No. I'm not happy.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.115
'Cause this is the kind of talk
I wish we had before.

14:11.117 --> 14:14.285
These are the important talks.
This is so unlike you.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.321
Why are you being the
girl in this argument?

14:16.323 --> 14:18.723
I don't know, Reagan.
I don't know.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.825
But I do know you're being
heteronormative.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.894
Okay? I know that word-- it's
in the zeitgeist, and I know

14:22.896 --> 14:25.964
that word, too. I don't know
why I'm acting this way.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.332
ANNOUNCER: If you're
out there, Nick Miller,

14:27.334 --> 14:29.000
you're our raffle winner!

14:29.002 --> 14:31.402
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.472
I did spend $190 on tickets.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.108
$200.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.411
I spent $250 on tickets.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.146
That's it.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.815
I spent over $300 on tickets.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.054
"Deciding which house
to go to for Thanksgiving,

14:50.056 --> 14:52.156
she was stuck
in a real parent trap."

14:52.158 --> 14:54.759
Enough. Enough. Enough.
Oh, you're right.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.160
This chapter's dragging.
Jess, please.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.429
Let me move on.
I-I need my freedom.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.665
I need my judge shows,
my fish sticks.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.700
My-my naked time.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.336
Oh, please don't expand on that.
No, it's a good thing.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.006
Ashley showed me how
to embrace my body.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.108
And I... every day, for
about a half an hour,

15:10.110 --> 15:12.043
I walk around here naked.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.112
Fabulous.
Did you sit on this chair?

15:14.114 --> 15:17.916
Jess... now I'm gonna
show you some tough love.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.385
I want you to go
back to California.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.053
(sighs)

15:22.055 --> 15:24.289
Wh-What's going on?

15:25.625 --> 15:28.192
It's Nick. I...

15:28.194 --> 15:32.096
What?
I'm-I'm in love with him,
and I can't...

15:32.098 --> 15:36.134
I can't do anything about it.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.937
I'm sorry.
He's really happy
with someone else.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.204
I couldn't go back there.
Hey, hey, hey.

15:40.206 --> 15:43.207
It's okay.
You don't have to.

15:43.209 --> 15:46.144
You can stay here
as long as you want.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.380
You've been taking care of me,
now I'm gonna take care of you.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.950
You know what,
I'm gonna read you

15:51.952 --> 15:53.952
one of my favorite
books. See?

15:53.954 --> 15:57.555
Oh...
<i> Before the Web: The Story</i>
<i> of Telephone Operators.</i>

15:58.959 --> 16:01.592
"She sat by the switchboard,

16:01.594 --> 16:04.162
"anxiously awaiting...

16:04.164 --> 16:06.164
"the phone call.

16:06.166 --> 16:09.067
Ring. Ring."

16:12.172 --> 16:14.005
"Ring."

16:14.007 --> 16:16.841
I don't even understand
what we're arguing about.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.643
I'm mad about the promotion.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.144
And that you have
been sitting on it

16:20.146 --> 16:22.814
for a month and not telling me.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.415
I thought that you liked
that we have our own thing.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.950
I don't know, maybe I...
That we were two independent,

16:25.952 --> 16:27.485
different people
and we live our lives

16:27.487 --> 16:29.354
and then we come together
and we hang out.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.690
I just want more, I guess.
I want to talk about stuff,

16:32.692 --> 16:34.959
and I know while I'm saying this
I hate that I'm saying it,

16:34.961 --> 16:38.029
but I feel it.
Nick, we're
talking about stuff right now.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.364
No, we're not talking
about all the stuff.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.099
We're talking about
some of the stuff.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.967
How much stuff is there?
There's piles of stuff.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.036
There's piles upon
piles of stuff.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.838
Like, I want to talk about...
I want to talk about

16:46.840 --> 16:48.272
why we don't have
nicknames for each other?

16:48.274 --> 16:49.273
I mean, why don't
we call each other

16:49.275 --> 16:50.875
Mr. Cub and Sparky?

16:50.877 --> 16:52.276
Who's Mr. Cub? You're Mr. Cub?

16:52.278 --> 16:53.711
You think<i> I</i> would be Sparky?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.313
If we had nicknames
it would not be those.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.181
You just call me Nick,
is my point.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.183
That's your name.
I know, but I would like

16:59.185 --> 17:02.120
to talk about nicknames.
It doesn't matter.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.188
All this matters.
This is the stuff.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.557
I want to talk about why you
have a second apartment.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.326
We talked about that.
And it was weird then.

17:08.328 --> 17:11.062
We barely talked about it. I
also want to talk about the fact

17:11.064 --> 17:12.864
I've never been at my
best sexually with you.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.165
I've been, like, a seven,

17:14.167 --> 17:15.066
but, at other times in my life,

17:15.068 --> 17:16.567
I've been an eight-and-a-half.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.703
Okay.
But you've only seen
a seven.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.072
So you think of me
as a seven in bed.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.173
But I'm an eight-and-a-half.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.008
I'm really tired.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.543
Can you just write it all down
and I'll fill it out

17:25.545 --> 17:27.178
and I'll get it back to you.
All right,

17:27.180 --> 17:28.913
then just answer me this,
and then we'll be done.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.181
'Cause this is important.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.050
If we weren't together

17:32.052 --> 17:35.086
and you were offered
this same promotion,

17:35.088 --> 17:37.955
would you take it?

17:41.528 --> 17:44.228
Yes, I would take it.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.800
Then you should take
the job, Reagan.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.070
Okay, I'll take it.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.339
Are we cool?

17:57.110 --> 17:58.276
Yeah.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.278
Dream job.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.114
Good, I'm so happy for you.
This is awesome.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.016
Uh, okay.
(clears throat)

18:05.018 --> 18:07.118
But before we go to bed tonight,

18:07.120 --> 18:09.620
can you please just do something
about your raffle prize?

18:09.622 --> 18:11.856
His name's Stewart.
Why did you bring it home?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.891
I don't know, I won.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.259
(grunts)

18:15.261 --> 18:17.795
Hey, thought I might
find you here.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.964
Oh. Hiding your maybes?

18:19.966 --> 18:23.101
(chuckles)
Sometimes I hide mine
in a garbage can.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.869
A new one.

18:24.871 --> 18:28.106
Don't try to talk me
out of worrying about my son.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.975
I won't.
I just want you to know

18:30.977 --> 18:32.410
you're not alone.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.045
I'm out there worrying
about him, too,

18:34.047 --> 18:36.948
but we have got
each other's backs.

18:39.886 --> 18:43.154
How's that dress gonna fit you
when you ain't got no legs?

18:44.557 --> 18:47.825
Oh. I need to
tell you something.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.828
No, no, just... let me go first.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.265
This job has given me so much.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.568
Purpose, pride, my future wife,

18:57.570 --> 19:00.138
CPR certification--
against my will, I might add,

19:00.140 --> 19:03.074
because I truly believe
that it is witchcraft,

19:03.076 --> 19:04.075
but that's not the point.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.511
I have tried so many things.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.513
But being a cop
is the first time

19:08.515 --> 19:11.682
I've ever felt a calling.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.184
I'm proud of you.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.989
Yeah. I-I will deal
with my fears.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.925
Um... but there's
one more thing.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.301
Oh, my God.

19:30.303 --> 19:34.272
Mom, you've been a cop
this whole time?

19:34.274 --> 19:36.140
No.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.441
You're not a cop.
It was your dad's.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.343
He's a cop.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.546
Wherever the
hell he is.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.282
Wow. Um...

19:44.284 --> 19:47.718
You know, that's the first thing
you ever told me about him.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.987
So you know I got
a lot of practice

19:49.989 --> 19:52.056
worrying about
someone coming home.

19:52.058 --> 19:55.126
Maybe that's the reason I'm
so overprotective with you.

19:55.128 --> 19:58.029
He left this behind,
among other things.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.131
I just use it to
get out of tickets.

20:00.133 --> 20:03.134
And one time I did use it
for a discount on a...

20:03.136 --> 20:04.502
a rental car.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.337
Oh.
Take it.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.139
No, I don't want it.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.840
You're my dad.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.542
You're my mom and my dad.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.678
I know that.
And I'm not saying

20:13.680 --> 20:15.880
he's not a piece
of crap, either.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.748
But you should have this.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.659
We can talk about this later,

20:28.661 --> 20:31.629
but what was the rental car
company you used?

20:33.733 --> 20:36.033
(sighs)

20:36.035 --> 20:39.003
Well, I don't think me and
Reagan are working out.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.173
Really? Oh, bub,
I'm so sorry.

20:42.175 --> 20:43.841
Come lay your head
on my bosom.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.076
Come here.
No, I'll do hers

20:45.078 --> 20:46.677
if I was gonna
do either, but...

20:48.047 --> 20:49.914
Well, I'm really glad
you guys are here.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.951
Tell us everything.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.086
But first,
say that one more time.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.021
Oh, you really want me to?
Yeah.
Yeah.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.623
Oh. Uh, I'm really
glad you're here.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.890
We're really glad
that we're here, too.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.225
Very happy about it.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.194
All right.
One more time.

21:03.196 --> 21:04.228
The part about you being glad
that we're here.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.197
Making me regret it.
One more time.

21:06.199 --> 21:07.031
I feel like we talked
about everything.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.566
I'm gonna grab a beer.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.134
(Australian accent):
I like American football a lot.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.203
And you know who I like,
I like that Tom Brady.

21:12.205 --> 21:14.805
Uh, I like the way he looks,
I like the way he smells.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.140
Nick, shut up, man!

21:16.142 --> 21:18.042
I'm at... I'm at work.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.978
Mi-mi-mi, mi-mi-mi. Chacho.
(deep voice): Chacho.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.114
This is traffic on the 12.
Linda?

21:23.116 --> 21:25.549
"Move! Get your ass out the way!

21:25.551 --> 21:27.618
I'm trying
to get to work on time."

21:27.620 --> 21:29.620
Linda, you okay?
"I'm fine.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.289
"It's the reason why I'm late.
I'm in traffic

21:31.291 --> 21:33.057
"behind a damn Camry.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.925
If he don't move his ass
out the way..."

21:34.927 --> 21:35.993
Linda, all right,
that's enough of you.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.496
(laughs)<i> PG-13.</i>
