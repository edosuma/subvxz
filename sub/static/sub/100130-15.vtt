00:15.449 --> 00:17.838
All right, Jessup, let's go.

00:18.009 --> 00:21.638
- Where?
- Downtown. Evidentiary hearing.

00:21.849 --> 00:24.966
My hearing?
It's not supposed to be until next week.

00:25.369 --> 00:27.564
Got moved up.

00:27.769 --> 00:30.966
- Open up Bane Jessup.
- Opening up Jessup.

00:33.529 --> 00:35.281
I've never seen you guys before.

00:35.489 --> 00:37.639
Hey, look, it's your hearing,
you don't wanna go, fine.

00:44.009 --> 00:46.398
Garbage in, garbage out, huh?

00:48.289 --> 00:50.564
Litvack sent you, didn't he?

01:20.929 --> 01:22.248
Hey. Hey.

01:24.449 --> 01:26.087
Stop.

01:32.089 --> 01:33.408
Hey, what's going on here?

01:39.969 --> 01:43.041
Leo's mortal now and everything,
but for how long?

01:43.209 --> 01:46.281
I mean, how do I know he won't
want his wings back some day?

01:46.489 --> 01:51.483
And then there's Dan,
who is still great and normal.

01:51.649 --> 01:55.961
- Which is good considering I'm not.
- Twenty-eight minutes, 33 seconds.

01:56.169 --> 01:57.443
Really? We ran that long?

01:57.649 --> 02:00.004
No, I'm timing how long
you've been comparing Leo and Dan.

02:00.209 --> 02:03.360
I haven't been comparing,
I've just been talking.

02:03.569 --> 02:05.127
Non-stop.

02:05.289 --> 02:07.598
Well, so, you're my sister,
I have a problem,

02:07.769 --> 02:09.839
the least you could be
is more understanding.

02:10.049 --> 02:12.358
Piper, I am understanding.

02:12.529 --> 02:14.520
You're in love with two guys
who both love you.

02:14.689 --> 02:16.486
I get it. Totally.

02:16.649 --> 02:19.322
But what I don't get
is why you won't let me help you.

02:19.489 --> 02:22.561
Help me? What are you gonna do?
Take one of them off my hands?

02:23.169 --> 02:24.318
That's not an option.

02:25.209 --> 02:26.198
Look, you're stuck.

02:26.369 --> 02:28.644
You don't wanna string them along,
but you can't make a choice.

02:28.809 --> 02:32.438
You need help, assistance, a sign.

02:32.649 --> 02:34.480
- A sign?
- A spell.

02:34.649 --> 02:37.607
One that will point the magical arrow
in the direction of your true love

02:37.809 --> 02:39.765
and end the great debate
once and for all.

02:40.449 --> 02:43.202
Like that doesn't have personal gain
tattooed across its forehead.

02:43.369 --> 02:46.884
Not necessarily.
I've been working on my spells.

02:47.049 --> 02:50.200
I think I can write one for you
that's consequence free.

02:50.369 --> 02:52.166
It's all in the wording.

02:52.649 --> 02:55.686
- No. I can't.
- Why not?

02:55.889 --> 02:59.564
Because I can't expect magic
to solve my personal problems.

02:59.729 --> 03:02.118
But that's the beauty.
You don't have to. I'll do it for you.

03:02.289 --> 03:04.280
Hey, when did
my camera equipment get here?

03:04.449 --> 03:07.122
Oh, about an hour ago. I didn't wanna
wake you. Is everything there?

03:07.289 --> 03:09.280
Yeah, it looks like it.

03:09.769 --> 03:13.284
Jeez, Prue,
think you bought enough stuff?

03:13.489 --> 03:14.638
Yeah, I know. It's a lot.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.404
But so much of photography
has gone digital now

03:17.569 --> 03:20.766
that if I wanna seriously pursue it,
I have to have the right equipment.

03:20.969 --> 03:24.644
Wait, you're thinking of becoming
a professional photographer?

03:25.769 --> 03:29.079
Yeah. Why, you don't think
that I should?

03:29.289 --> 03:33.805
No, no, I mean, I think it's great
if it's what you wanna do, it's just...

03:34.529 --> 03:36.008
It's just what?

03:36.209 --> 03:41.078
Well, isn't photography just
a really dicey profession moneywise?

03:43.209 --> 03:44.324
You know, all I'm saying

03:44.529 --> 03:47.123
is that, how many women professional
photographers do you know?

03:48.249 --> 03:50.046
I know, and that is
a totally fair question,

03:50.209 --> 03:52.086
one that I've been
wrestling with a lot lately.

03:52.249 --> 03:54.717
Like, ever since I quit my job.

03:55.049 --> 03:58.519
Prue, you dreamt of winning the
Pulitzer in photography back in college.

03:58.689 --> 04:01.840
You never wanted to work in
the museum or at the auction house.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.284
That's something you did for us
so we could keep the house.

04:04.489 --> 04:07.287
So now it is your turn
to follow your dreams.

04:07.449 --> 04:10.441
Hey, maybe finding out you were
a photographer in your last life

04:10.609 --> 04:12.565
is some kind of sign.

04:13.929 --> 04:15.521
Speaking of signs.

04:17.849 --> 04:20.043
No. Wait. No.

04:33.329 --> 04:35.320
Portrait of a dreamer.

04:36.929 --> 04:40.001
Phoebe, you're not in there
writing a spell for me, are you?

04:40.729 --> 04:43.960
No. I'm in the bathroom.
Who writes spells in the bathroom?

04:44.169 --> 04:46.046
I'll be right out.

04:46.249 --> 04:49.685
Okay.
I beseech all powers above

04:49.849 --> 04:52.363
Send a sign to frame my sister's heart

04:52.569 --> 04:56.721
One that will lead her to her love

04:59.089 --> 05:01.080
Hello, Prue.

06:32.049 --> 06:34.438
- Well?
- Nothing.

06:34.649 --> 06:37.117
Okay, we have to keep trying
till you do get a premonition.

06:37.289 --> 06:39.086
We have to figure out
what happened to Prue.

06:39.929 --> 06:44.002
Piper, that crack that I made
about her becoming a photographer,

06:44.169 --> 06:46.285
I don't want that to be the last thing
I say to her.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.083
Phoebe, you're overreacting.
That is my department.

06:49.249 --> 06:51.399
All you have to do
is relax and concentrate.

06:52.409 --> 06:54.923
Here. Try the rag again.

07:05.889 --> 07:09.564
I got bad news and I got worse news.
Which do you want first?

07:09.729 --> 07:11.526
Phoebe.

07:14.249 --> 07:16.285
Does this have anything
to do with Prue?

07:16.849 --> 07:19.807
Unless she helped Bane Jessup
escape from county jail, no.

07:20.009 --> 07:22.318
Bane Jessup, why does
that name sound familiar?

07:22.489 --> 07:24.400
Because he's the guy
our favourite demon

07:24.609 --> 07:26.042
hired to eighty-six us, remember?

07:26.249 --> 07:29.047
- The one we thought Prue liked?
- Yes.

07:29.209 --> 07:30.403
When did he escape?

07:30.609 --> 07:33.646
This morning. We've already launched
a full-scale manhunt to...

07:34.289 --> 07:35.961
What is it? What's wrong?

07:36.129 --> 07:38.404
Prue is missing. We think
she may have been kidnapped.

07:38.569 --> 07:41.163
And we found this by the back door.

07:43.849 --> 07:44.838
Chloroform.

07:45.049 --> 07:49.725
We would've called you, but we didn't
know who or what had taken her.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.681
Be a pretty big coincidence
if it wasn't Bane,

07:51.849 --> 07:54.409
especially since you guys
are responsible for putting him in jail.

07:54.889 --> 07:56.845
Yeah, but why take just Prue?
Why not all of us?

07:57.289 --> 07:59.325
Well, maybe he's trying to lure us.

07:59.489 --> 08:01.445
Maybe another demon
hired him to trap us.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.643
Which might explain this.

08:04.169 --> 08:06.239
I found it when we swept
the prison lot this morning.

08:06.409 --> 08:08.081
It's actually the reason
why I came over.

08:08.249 --> 08:10.843
I wanted to see
if it looked familiar to you.

08:12.929 --> 08:14.157
Well, it's definitely demonic.

08:14.569 --> 08:15.604
Do you mind if we keep this

08:15.769 --> 08:17.964
so we can figure out
what demon we're dealing with?

08:18.369 --> 08:21.281
I can't exactly turn that in
to evidence inventory.

08:22.969 --> 08:26.041
Look, I gotta go.
Let me know if you find out anything.

08:26.209 --> 08:29.485
I think that your chances of
finding Bane are bigger than ours now.

08:29.649 --> 08:31.446
Yeah. And could you maybe
keep this quiet,

08:31.649 --> 08:34.322
because the bigger this thing gets,
the more danger she's...

08:34.929 --> 08:38.717
I know. Look, I'll keep it as quiet
as I can, for as long as I can.

08:39.249 --> 08:40.238
Thanks.

08:43.889 --> 08:48.724
Hi there. Gotta sign.
It's for Piper, Piper Halliwell?

08:51.969 --> 08:53.846
Can I see that?

08:54.929 --> 08:59.605
Leonardo's Boutique.
Bodega Bay, California.

09:00.169 --> 09:03.445
Yeah, Dan and I were there,
ordered some earrings. Thank you.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.360
The deliveryman said he "gotta sign."

09:13.169 --> 09:15.444
Leonardo's Boutique in Bodega Bay.

09:15.609 --> 09:19.887
Leo, short for Leonardo.
Bodega Bay, where Dan is from.

09:21.689 --> 09:23.919
Don't act blonde.
You cast that spell, didn't you?

09:24.129 --> 09:27.678
- Yes, I did.
- When I specifically asked you not to.

09:27.849 --> 09:30.522
- And at a time like this.
- I was just trying to help, Piper.

09:30.689 --> 09:35.285
- And it was before Prue disappeared.
- You, this, Book of Shadows, go.

09:41.649 --> 09:45.642
- What? What did you see?
- Prue, bound and gagged.

09:45.809 --> 09:47.003
And with Bane.

10:03.249 --> 10:06.446
- Don't scream.
- Why not?

10:07.449 --> 10:10.646
Because if you do,
we won't be able to talk.

10:10.809 --> 10:13.687
Besides, it won't help. The nearest
neighbour is about six miles away.

10:13.849 --> 10:16.079
Why not take off the blindfold?
What are you afraid of?

10:16.569 --> 10:20.403
Are you kidding? I've seen you use
your powers before. On me.

10:22.209 --> 10:26.680
All right, if you try anything,
the blindfold goes back on.

10:33.169 --> 10:34.966
What do you want?

10:35.689 --> 10:38.157
Your help. To save my life.

10:38.369 --> 10:40.724
Well, most people ask for it,
they don't kidnap for it.

10:40.929 --> 10:43.397
I'm not most people.
Neither are you.

10:43.609 --> 10:45.167
What makes you think
that I'll help you?

10:45.529 --> 10:48.168
I don't.
But without you and your sisters,

10:48.369 --> 10:50.644
I don't stand a chance
against this particular demon.

10:51.049 --> 10:53.643
Yeah, well, from where I'm sitting
that's a good thing.

10:55.009 --> 10:58.638
He tried to have me killed today, Prue.
I got lucky and barely escaped.

10:58.849 --> 10:59.964
And he's gonna keep trying.

11:00.129 --> 11:02.199
Why would he bother?
You're a mortal.

11:02.369 --> 11:06.123
A mortal that knows about demons.
He doesn't like that.

11:06.489 --> 11:08.639
Litvack, that's what they call him.

11:10.649 --> 11:11.923
Where are we?

11:14.689 --> 11:15.963
This yours?

11:16.689 --> 11:17.883
It was going to be,

11:18.049 --> 11:20.517
before you came along,
cut me off from my dreams.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.481
Because you tried to kill me.

11:23.209 --> 11:25.484
Well, that was before
I got to know you.

11:26.089 --> 11:27.522
You don't strike me as a dreamer.

11:28.009 --> 11:30.045
Well, there's a lot about me
you don't know.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.560
A few things that you need
to learn about me too.

11:37.769 --> 11:40.442
Like how I will never
put my sisters in danger.

11:40.609 --> 11:43.487
So you can forget about
any of us helping you.

11:48.889 --> 11:53.280
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to trust me, Prue.

12:18.569 --> 12:21.447
About freaking time.
What took you so long?

12:21.609 --> 12:26.524
- We had a little problem.
- Problem? What problem?

12:26.689 --> 12:28.805
Where's your partner?

12:29.009 --> 12:31.125
Do not tell me
that you screwed this up.

12:31.289 --> 12:34.838
Do not tell me
that Bane Jessup is still alive.

12:35.049 --> 12:36.846
How is that even possible?

12:37.049 --> 12:39.643
He's a lousy mortal.
How hard can it be?

12:39.849 --> 12:43.319
He's smart. He wasn't surprised
we were coming for him.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.599
Of course not, you idiot.

12:45.769 --> 12:49.159
That's why we wanted him offed.
Because he knows about us.

12:51.209 --> 12:54.519
Oh, jeez, think, think, think.
What are we gonna tell Litvack?

12:54.689 --> 12:59.763
You're going to tell me how you plan
to rectify this little problem,

12:59.969 --> 13:02.244
is how I believe you phrased it.

13:02.809 --> 13:04.208
On your knees.

13:25.529 --> 13:26.962
I saw what you saw.

13:28.769 --> 13:33.320
How he used you to kill the other,
how he got away.

13:34.129 --> 13:37.166
- How you lost the weapon.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

13:37.369 --> 13:38.563
You lost the weapon?

13:38.729 --> 13:40.959
The guards were coming,
I had to run.

13:41.129 --> 13:45.168
To find a mortal,
all you need to do is follow his dreams.

13:45.889 --> 13:47.925
That's where they always escape to.

13:48.809 --> 13:49.878
Do you understand me?

13:51.089 --> 13:53.887
He'll find Jessup. I swear.

13:54.689 --> 13:55.883
No.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.240
You will.
And then you'll find the weapon.

14:07.449 --> 14:09.326
No loose ends.

14:16.449 --> 14:20.203
We couldn't find it
in the Book of Shadows anywhere.

14:20.409 --> 14:22.877
- It's a weapon.
- Are you kidding me? It's a weapon?

14:23.049 --> 14:25.358
One that can only be activated
by a demon.

14:25.529 --> 14:28.248
From what I remember, it's handed out
by a specific upper-level demon

14:28.409 --> 14:29.728
to those who work for him.

14:29.929 --> 14:33.319
- What do you mean upper-level?
- There's a hierarchy of demons.

14:33.489 --> 14:36.959
They try to work their way up
by destroying good, promoting evil.

14:37.129 --> 14:39.802
Whoever issued this particular weapon
is very important.

14:40.009 --> 14:44.764
- You mean dangerous. Any idea who?
- No.

14:47.089 --> 14:49.478
All right, well, this weapon may be
the only way to find Prue.

14:49.649 --> 14:51.640
I'm back to the Book.

14:52.729 --> 14:54.242
I'll be right there.

14:54.409 --> 14:56.161
Thanks for coming over
so quickly, Leo,

14:56.329 --> 14:57.921
and your offer
to take care of the club.

14:58.089 --> 15:00.045
Is there anything else you need?

15:00.209 --> 15:03.042
I don't know. I can't do anything
but think about Prue right now.

15:04.289 --> 15:06.849
Remember, you know
the most important thing.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.798
Phoebe's premonition proves
that Prue is still alive.

15:10.849 --> 15:14.046
I know. But for how long?
I mean, what if we can't get to her?

15:14.209 --> 15:15.403
What if she's hurt?

15:20.089 --> 15:21.647
I wish I could do more...

15:23.769 --> 15:26.806
...because I can't help, but remember
all the times that I could.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.043
I don't think you understand.

15:51.209 --> 15:54.007
As long as you're here with me,
your life is on the line too, you know.

15:54.209 --> 15:56.518
- I can take care of myself.
- Not against Litvack.

15:56.729 --> 15:58.526
You have a fighting chance
with your sisters,

15:58.689 --> 16:01.965
but as long as you're alone,
you're as powerless as I am.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.478
Even if you can't trust me,
you can trust that.

16:04.689 --> 16:06.680
I told you I'm not getting
my sisters involved.

16:06.889 --> 16:09.562
All right, fine. Your sisters
came looking for you once before,

16:09.729 --> 16:11.924
they'll come looking again.

16:12.329 --> 16:13.523
Not if I can help it.

16:19.529 --> 16:23.204
A weapon issued
by level-two demons?

16:23.849 --> 16:26.044
But it doesn't say
which level-two demon.

16:30.969 --> 16:34.279
- I love it when it does that.
- "Mariners"?

16:34.489 --> 16:37.287
Well, they're not demons,
they're sea fairies.

16:37.449 --> 16:41.362
That's because it has nothing to do
with Prue, Phoebe, it's a sign.

16:41.529 --> 16:44.089
Dan was a baseball player
for the Seattle Mariners.

16:44.249 --> 16:46.843
No one feels worse
than I do right now.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.804
Prue, you're okay, thank God.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.324
Yeah, but Bane Jessup,
he kidnapped me.

16:53.529 --> 16:54.757
We know. Where are you?

16:54.929 --> 16:56.726
- You can't find me.
- What do you mean?

16:56.889 --> 16:58.686
It's a trap, just stay away,
don't look for me.

16:58.889 --> 17:01.722
- What? Wait. Wait, Prue.
- Wait. Hello?

17:04.329 --> 17:05.967
Hey, are you all right?

17:06.128 --> 17:07.642
I thought you passed out
or something.

17:09.009 --> 17:10.839
Feeling guilty?

17:11.529 --> 17:13.679
That's a good sign.
Means that you have a conscience.

17:17.648 --> 17:18.843
What are you doing?

17:19.848 --> 17:23.000
- I'm letting you go.
- Just like that?

17:23.209 --> 17:25.483
I never wanted to hurt you, Prue.
I only wanted your help.

17:26.209 --> 17:28.279
But you can't help me
if you don't trust me.

17:28.489 --> 17:31.162
And you're in danger
as long as you're here.

17:32.129 --> 17:34.597
There's a market
a mile down the road.

17:36.449 --> 17:38.201
You'll never see me again,
I promise.

17:58.969 --> 18:00.687
Told you I never wanted to hurt you.

18:01.409 --> 18:03.559
You just saved my life.

18:06.009 --> 18:07.601
You think you can trust me now?

18:23.089 --> 18:25.557
- Tell me you're kidding.
- It's all over the news.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.607
We called as soon as we saw
the first broadcast. Look.

18:28.809 --> 18:30.322
I'm reporting live
from the county jail,

18:30.489 --> 18:32.878
where an inmate escaped
earlier this morning.

18:33.049 --> 18:36.041
A massive manhunt has been
launched to find the escapee,

18:36.209 --> 18:38.200
a man by the name of Bane Jessup

18:38.409 --> 18:40.161
who was awaiting trial
for racketeering,

18:40.369 --> 18:42.360
money laundering
and embezzlement.

18:42.529 --> 18:44.838
So much for keeping things quiet.
This is a nightmare.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.524
- Welcome to our world.
- You want some aspirin?

18:48.089 --> 18:50.922
What I want is Prue safe,
Bane put in jail,

18:51.089 --> 18:52.807
and nobody hurt by any...

18:55.209 --> 18:57.598
- Do you know what that is yet?
- We're still looking.

18:57.769 --> 19:00.044
We do know
that Bane definitely kidnapped Prue.

19:00.249 --> 19:02.763
- Has he made contact with you?
- No, but she has.

19:04.089 --> 19:06.398
It's a long story, but she's okay.

19:06.609 --> 19:09.169
She said not to come looking for her.
She said it was a trap.

19:09.369 --> 19:11.519
Did she say what kind?

19:13.089 --> 19:15.364
Maybe this will help.

19:15.569 --> 19:16.888
It's the DA's file on Bane.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.161
It's all the information
they pulled together for his trials.

19:20.369 --> 19:23.327
It's everything I could copy
before I got your phone call.

19:26.729 --> 19:28.401
Hello?

19:28.729 --> 19:30.128
Really?

19:30.329 --> 19:33.401
It's someone calling
for a Leonora Watkins.

19:34.009 --> 19:37.319
Leonora Watkins. Isn't that weird?

19:38.489 --> 19:39.808
You have the wrong number.

19:42.129 --> 19:45.087
Anyway, we believe
that Bane is holed up somewhere.

19:45.289 --> 19:47.519
Maybe there's something in there
that can tell you where.

19:47.689 --> 19:49.759
So, what the hell is he doing?

19:50.529 --> 19:52.963
Oh, God,
I hope he's not hurting her.

19:55.249 --> 19:57.046
Prue.

19:57.209 --> 19:59.677
If I'm gonna clean the wound,
then I have to stop the bleeding,

19:59.849 --> 20:01.168
I'm sorry.

20:01.329 --> 20:02.842
Do you even know
what you're doing?

20:03.289 --> 20:06.759
No, not really. But right now
I'm the only choice that you've got.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.565
- So just try and hold still.
- That's easy for you to say.

20:10.729 --> 20:13.721
You don't have a set of fingernails
clawing into your body.

20:13.889 --> 20:17.279
Yeah, well, I'm almost done,
put this in your mouth or something.

20:18.329 --> 20:21.446
Forget about me, go home
before Litvack's man comes back.

20:21.849 --> 20:25.558
I told you, he's gone.
Probably ran right back to Litvack.

20:25.769 --> 20:28.806
So now he knows about you too.
All the more reason to leave.

20:29.649 --> 20:31.958
Yeah, well, as much
as I would like to, I can't.

20:34.449 --> 20:36.804
Not until I know that you're okay.

20:37.009 --> 20:38.840
Besides, it's probably better
just to stay put.

20:39.049 --> 20:41.882
I mean, now that we've been sighted,
they'll expect for us to take off.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.762
Speaking of things
that need to be taken off,

20:45.929 --> 20:48.238
your pants.

20:49.169 --> 20:55.165
- Excuse me?
- Well, I need to get to the wound.

20:56.609 --> 20:58.486
Forget it.

20:58.729 --> 21:00.765
Okay, you know what?
It's just gonna get infected.

21:00.929 --> 21:03.318
So you can either
take your pants off on your own,

21:03.489 --> 21:06.128
or I can always do it by force.

21:18.809 --> 21:22.438
I'm getting nowhere and everywhere.
How about you, any luck?

21:22.649 --> 21:24.844
I'll give Bane this, he works hard.

21:25.009 --> 21:28.524
Tax evasion, racketeering.
Pick a crime, any crime.

21:29.129 --> 21:32.804
I feel like we're looking right at
the answer, we're just not seeing it.

21:33.009 --> 21:34.078
Got good taste too.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.160
There's a whole
money-laundering indictment here

21:36.369 --> 21:37.802
based on a real-estate development.

21:38.489 --> 21:41.720
Exclusive custom homes.
They're really gorgeous.

21:41.889 --> 21:43.004
Check out the brochure.

21:43.889 --> 21:45.288
Mariner's Bluff.

21:47.249 --> 21:49.683
I'm sure the sea fairies
will be very happy here.

21:49.849 --> 21:51.328
What did you say?

21:52.449 --> 21:55.839
Phoebe, what exactly
did your spell say?

21:56.009 --> 22:00.127
"I beseech all powers above
Send a sign to free my sister's heart

22:00.329 --> 22:02.081
One that will lead her to her love"

22:02.249 --> 22:03.648
Why?

22:03.809 --> 22:05.162
Because the Book of Shadows

22:05.329 --> 22:07.797
specifically opened
to the Mariner section.

22:08.009 --> 22:11.319
What if the signs we're getting
have nothing to do with Dan and Leo

22:11.489 --> 22:13.127
and everything to do with Prue?

22:14.209 --> 22:16.439
Where is Mariner's Bluff?

22:18.409 --> 22:19.444
Bodega Bay.

22:20.369 --> 22:22.758
Leonardo's Boutique of Bodega Bay.

22:22.969 --> 22:25.483
- Piper, I think you're right.
- Okay, so, what were the clues?

22:25.689 --> 22:28.806
Mariners, Bodega Bay,
Leonora Watkins.

22:29.009 --> 22:30.920
Watkins Road exit.

22:31.089 --> 22:33.159
So we've almost found her.
All we need is an address.

22:33.369 --> 22:35.519
What's this?

22:35.729 --> 22:38.289
- Let's see.
- Are the lots numbered?

22:40.409 --> 22:42.001
In an exhibition game last night,

22:42.169 --> 22:44.922
the Mariners lost to the Angels,
8 to 7.

22:45.129 --> 22:47.324
In other news, Sammy Sosa...

22:47.529 --> 22:51.408
Okay, now we're back to Dan and Leo.
Mariners, Angels.

22:51.609 --> 22:54.282
No, Phoebe, "8 to 7."

22:54.449 --> 22:56.565
Lot 827?

22:56.889 --> 22:59.005
Yes, there's an 827
at the top of the hill.

22:59.209 --> 23:00.483
I'll drive, you navigate.

23:08.529 --> 23:10.520
Prue, why are you still here?

23:13.049 --> 23:15.244
Because...

23:15.969 --> 23:17.368
...I believe you.

23:18.689 --> 23:22.807
Well, thank you. It's been a long time
since someone believed in me.

23:23.689 --> 23:26.203
Maybe that's because
you stopped believing in yourself.

23:28.209 --> 23:30.040
You know,
I haven't always been like this.

23:30.889 --> 23:34.279
The wrong side of the law,
always looking over my shoulder.

23:34.489 --> 23:37.083
I had dreams once.

23:37.609 --> 23:39.042
Big dreams.

23:41.649 --> 23:43.879
It's not too late to change, you know.

23:44.529 --> 23:47.566
Well, it's too late for me.
But not for you.

23:47.729 --> 23:51.517
So you should definitely go.
So you can still have your dreams.

23:51.689 --> 23:55.045
- Easier said than done.
- What do you mean?

23:55.729 --> 23:56.718
I don't know.

23:56.889 --> 24:01.644
I've just been thinking lately that
maybe dreams are just that, dreams.

24:02.729 --> 24:04.481
I don't believe that.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.604
I'm sorry.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.403
I'm not.

24:43.409 --> 24:45.400
Interesting.

24:46.329 --> 24:48.604
I know. I screwed up.

24:49.289 --> 24:51.484
Oblivion, right?

24:52.409 --> 24:54.400
This is different.

24:54.609 --> 24:57.407
You weren't just up against a mortal.

24:57.809 --> 25:01.802
From what I saw,
you were also up against a witch.

25:02.449 --> 25:04.917
No excuse.
Hundreds of witches out there,

25:05.089 --> 25:07.045
I should be able
to handle one by myself.

25:08.009 --> 25:10.204
This was different.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.399
Powerful. Very powerful.

25:15.009 --> 25:17.318
Take me to
this mortal's dream house.

25:18.209 --> 25:21.758
Why? They gotta be
long gone by now.

25:22.209 --> 25:24.325
But their essence remains.

25:24.489 --> 25:27.845
I'll need to tap into it
if I expect to reach their minds.

25:29.129 --> 25:32.485
Reach their minds? To what end?

25:33.329 --> 25:34.444
Theirs.

25:36.209 --> 25:38.359
The Source likes it
when I feed him witches.

25:42.089 --> 25:45.081
That's how I got to where I am.

26:04.129 --> 26:06.279
Prue?

26:09.089 --> 26:10.886
Prue?

26:13.529 --> 26:15.326
Prue?

26:16.609 --> 26:18.201
The view is amazing.

26:18.849 --> 26:20.168
It's not as good as mine.

26:22.729 --> 26:24.560
I thought maybe you left.

26:25.169 --> 26:28.002
No, I just couldn't really find
all of my clothes.

26:31.609 --> 26:34.567
Look, I'll help you with Litvack.

26:34.729 --> 26:38.722
You just have to promise me that you'll
turn yourself back in when it's all over.

26:39.649 --> 26:41.526
Bane.

26:41.849 --> 26:47.526
You know, I was thinking maybe this,
us, doesn't have to end.

26:48.129 --> 26:50.927
That maybe we can go somewhere
where we could be together,

26:51.089 --> 26:54.240
get away from all this.
What do you say?

26:56.329 --> 26:59.605
I would say that you're beginning
to strike me as a dreamer.

27:06.569 --> 27:08.287
Bane.

27:08.489 --> 27:13.279
- Oh, my God.
- What are you guys doing here?

27:13.489 --> 27:16.606
We're rescuing you
from the tall, dark and naked man.

27:17.009 --> 27:20.763
- I told you to stay away.
- Yeah, now I know why. He is yummy.

27:20.969 --> 27:22.880
I don't believe this.
We've been frantic,

27:23.049 --> 27:25.643
worried sick about you,
thinking you've been kidnapped...

27:25.809 --> 27:27.447
Yeah, I was.

27:27.609 --> 27:29.361
Panties.

27:32.489 --> 27:36.038
Thanks. Look, you guys
have really got this all...

27:37.609 --> 27:40.203
...wrong.
- Yeah, we know, it's a trap.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.041
A tall, dark and naked trap.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.606
All right, how did you two
find me anyway?

27:44.809 --> 27:45.924
We'll explain that later.

27:46.089 --> 27:48.683
We really need to be going now
because there's a demon behind this.

27:48.889 --> 27:50.720
Yeah, Litvack.
Wait, how did you know?

27:50.929 --> 27:53.443
We have the weapon he used
to break Bane out of jail.

27:53.849 --> 27:58.479
No, no, no. He tried to kill Bane in jail,
not break him out.

27:58.649 --> 28:00.924
Or so Bane says.

28:01.129 --> 28:03.927
I believe him, because one of the
guys came here and tried to kill me.

28:04.129 --> 28:06.882
- All the more reason we should go.
- Fine, then just unfreeze him.

28:07.089 --> 28:08.363
You want us to bring him along?

28:08.809 --> 28:11.118
Well, yeah. I mean,
I told him that I would help him.

28:11.329 --> 28:14.526
I can't leave him here when everything
I need to do is clearly at the manor.

28:19.929 --> 28:21.806
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

28:21.969 --> 28:25.484
Nice to see you again.
Why don't you put some clothes on?

28:34.889 --> 28:38.120
Listen, you guys have any peroxide
and stuff? I think I should clean this up.

28:38.969 --> 28:40.880
Yeah, upstairs bathroom,
medicine cabinet.

28:41.049 --> 28:42.960
All right, thanks.

28:47.289 --> 28:50.167
First, I'd like to tell you
how relieved I am you're okay.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.318
Me too.

28:51.489 --> 28:54.879
And second, I'd like to tell you that
you have completely lost your mind.

28:55.049 --> 28:56.960
Completely lost your mind.

28:57.129 --> 28:58.881
Okay. We have a demon to vanquish.

28:59.089 --> 29:00.317
You really wanna help him?

29:01.569 --> 29:05.687
Piper, past aside,
I know an innocent when I see one.

29:05.849 --> 29:06.918
And I trust him.

29:07.369 --> 29:09.439
- Prue...
- Phoebe, I'm going to help him.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.159
Think about this,
how well do you really know him?

29:12.369 --> 29:14.564
Regardless,
Litvack has to be vanquished

29:14.729 --> 29:16.924
whether Bane is on our side or not.

29:17.129 --> 29:20.360
It would be nice to know that
ahead of time. Minimize the surprises.

29:21.209 --> 29:23.279
You really wanna minimize them?

29:23.449 --> 29:25.121
Help me find Litvack
in the Book of Shadows.

29:40.049 --> 29:43.928
Hello, Bane. It's telepathic connection.

29:44.089 --> 29:46.478
I'm only in your mind.

29:49.569 --> 29:51.207
How did you find me?

29:51.369 --> 29:52.722
Your essence.

29:52.929 --> 29:56.638
This dream house of yours
reeks of it.

29:57.089 --> 30:01.207
It's a beautiful place. Too bad
you won't live long enough to enjoy it.

30:02.329 --> 30:05.924
- You don't scare me.
- Sure I do. I scare everybody.

30:06.129 --> 30:07.767
For good reason.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.840
By the way,

30:11.009 --> 30:13.523
your essence isn't the only one
I sense here.

30:14.289 --> 30:16.519
You bedded a witch.

30:16.689 --> 30:20.398
And not just any witch,
one of the Charmed Ones.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.167
My offer is simple.

30:23.369 --> 30:26.679
Your life in exchange for theirs.

30:27.849 --> 30:29.885
Screw you, Litvack.

30:32.329 --> 30:33.762
You can't hide from me.

30:33.929 --> 30:36.318
I can keep sending demons
after you for eternity,

30:36.489 --> 30:38.878
till one of them finally gets you.

30:40.609 --> 30:44.284
You know me, Bane,
better than you wish you did.

30:44.489 --> 30:47.208
I'm evil, just like you are.

30:47.809 --> 30:50.323
And you can't change that
no matter what you do,

30:50.529 --> 30:52.838
or who you sleep with.

30:53.009 --> 30:54.408
It's who you are.

30:57.129 --> 30:59.518
Bring me the witches,

30:59.809 --> 31:02.369
and then bring me back
my weapon,

31:02.929 --> 31:05.841
and I'll give you all your dreams.

31:08.849 --> 31:11.044
Bane, are you in there?

31:11.449 --> 31:15.442
Yeah. Yeah. I'll be right out.

31:17.929 --> 31:19.408
Hi.

31:19.969 --> 31:22.358
I thought that you had
skipped out on me or something.

31:22.569 --> 31:25.959
No, I was just washing up.

31:34.649 --> 31:37.243
So is he gonna do it or not?

31:40.809 --> 31:42.481
I found Litvack in the Book,

31:42.649 --> 31:44.401
but there's nothing
about how to vanquish him.

31:44.609 --> 31:46.998
Maybe that means there isn't a way.

31:49.089 --> 31:51.159
Where there's a demon,
there's a way.

31:53.009 --> 31:55.523
Our jewellery better still be
where it's supposed to be.

31:57.289 --> 31:59.200
- We need to focus on Litvack.
- Do we?

31:59.369 --> 32:02.247
I mean, aside from the fact there's
nothing in the Book that can help us,

32:02.409 --> 32:04.047
maybe we should
just let bad enough alone.

32:04.209 --> 32:06.518
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about our lives.

32:06.689 --> 32:08.008
As in, saving them.

32:08.209 --> 32:10.120
This demon has powers
we don't know about.

32:10.289 --> 32:12.883
Why go up against him unprepared?
What's the rush?

32:13.049 --> 32:14.482
He doesn't know about us
or anything.

32:14.649 --> 32:16.207
Sure he does.

32:17.009 --> 32:20.046
I mean, the demon he sent after us
saw Prue's power, right?

32:20.249 --> 32:21.443
You know he told Litvack.

32:22.049 --> 32:24.609
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that he knows about all three of us.

32:24.809 --> 32:26.401
Look, all I'm saying
is he knows enough.

32:26.569 --> 32:28.366
You don't go after him,
he comes after you.

32:29.609 --> 32:32.646
- How can you be sure?
- Because I know him, that's why.

32:32.809 --> 32:34.288
Better than I wish I did.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.320
Okay, still doesn't help us
vanquish him.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.525
I just wish we knew
what his other powers were.

32:40.169 --> 32:43.798
- You don't know what they are?
- No idea.

32:46.969 --> 32:48.482
You still have that weapon, right?

32:49.369 --> 32:52.247
- Why?
- Might be your only hope.

32:52.449 --> 32:54.679
I thought only another demon
could activate it.

32:54.889 --> 32:57.642
I got one to activate it before,
maybe I could do it again.

32:58.129 --> 33:00.848
Yeah, he's right. That's how
he took out the demon guard.

33:01.249 --> 33:02.318
So he says.

33:02.929 --> 33:04.760
- Do you think I'm lying?
- What do you think?

33:05.649 --> 33:07.799
I think I don't like
your implications, lady.

33:08.009 --> 33:10.477
I'm in this mess because Litvack
tried to off me, remember?

33:10.689 --> 33:12.407
You don't trust me, fine.
I don't care.

33:12.609 --> 33:15.077
But trust this, I've had it
with all this supernatural crap,

33:15.249 --> 33:17.638
and I'll do anything I have to
to get out from underneath it.

33:18.369 --> 33:23.045
- That's what worries me.
- Okay, you know what? I trust him.

33:23.409 --> 33:26.242
And, please, I'm just asking
you guys to trust me.

33:26.449 --> 33:29.441
If we're going to get Litvack, then
we're gonna have to work together.

33:30.249 --> 33:33.878
With Bane.
Otherwise, we're all gonna be dead.

33:35.729 --> 33:39.119
Okay, Phoebe,
let's go get that weapon. Come on.

33:43.609 --> 33:47.522
- I don't really know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

33:47.689 --> 33:49.486
I'll be right back.

33:59.089 --> 34:00.647
We're on our way.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.918
He lives in a cemetery? How cliché.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.967
Well, at least it's not
a warehouse again.

34:12.248 --> 34:15.286
Do we really think this is a good idea?
We don't really have a plan.

34:15.489 --> 34:18.879
Yeah, sure we do. Bane goes in,
we follow, you freeze Litvack,

34:19.049 --> 34:20.846
we put the weapon in his hand,
turn it on him.

34:21.009 --> 34:23.045
- I mean, it's pretty simple.
- Still.

34:23.208 --> 34:24.847
Maybe you should
give me that weapon.

34:25.009 --> 34:26.078
Oh, I don't think so.

34:26.289 --> 34:28.007
Listen, the guy wants me dead,
remember?

34:28.208 --> 34:30.928
The only way for me to stay alive
long enough for our plan to work

34:31.129 --> 34:32.847
is to show him good faith.

34:33.049 --> 34:35.847
Double-crossing us shows some
pretty good faith too, don't you think?

34:36.049 --> 34:37.562
Pheebs, we've been through this.

34:37.768 --> 34:39.600
Yeah, well,
it doesn't change my mind, Prue.

34:39.809 --> 34:44.360
All right, give it to him.
We're either doing this or not.

34:45.809 --> 34:47.606
Thank you.

34:58.489 --> 35:00.923
You guys wait at the base of the steps
for my signal.

35:06.329 --> 35:08.126
Trust me.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.079
I hope we're not making
a huge mistake.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.880
Hello, Litvack.

35:36.289 --> 35:37.483
Well, well.

35:40.009 --> 35:42.045
I was wondering when
you were gonna show.

35:48.969 --> 35:50.402
Before you kill me...

35:53.649 --> 35:55.446
It's all right.

35:59.089 --> 36:04.288
I wanted to give you something,
hoping you would spare me.

36:08.849 --> 36:11.522
I'm afraid it's gonna take
much more than this.

36:11.889 --> 36:13.527
Now.

36:16.569 --> 36:20.039
- That was easy.
- A little too easy.

36:20.249 --> 36:22.638
Let's just get this over with.

36:26.329 --> 36:30.527
He didn't freeze. He...
He didn't freeze.

36:31.129 --> 36:33.199
I'm immune
to the parlour tricks of witches.

36:34.049 --> 36:37.166
What's the matter?
Bane didn't tell you about that power?

36:37.569 --> 36:39.719
He said he didn't know.

36:40.689 --> 36:42.486
He knew.

36:42.649 --> 36:44.207
He just didn't tell you.

36:46.489 --> 36:48.923
He showed his true colours.

36:49.089 --> 36:51.649
His true evil colours.

36:55.129 --> 36:57.723
Prue, I just want you to know,
I am really pissed at you.

36:57.889 --> 37:00.483
No, no, wait. Something isn't right.

37:00.689 --> 37:03.328
This is gonna please The Source.

37:04.009 --> 37:05.920
Piper, unfreeze Bane.

37:06.129 --> 37:08.199
- Hurry.
- What?

37:12.969 --> 37:15.085
Tell The Source that we said hi.

37:18.769 --> 37:20.202
Traitor.

37:32.689 --> 37:35.362
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

37:35.569 --> 37:36.638
What just happened here?

37:37.609 --> 37:41.079
Bane just saved our lives
is what happened.

37:41.289 --> 37:43.041
Are you saying this was
all part of the plan,

37:43.209 --> 37:45.165
to make it look like
you were double-crossing us?

37:45.369 --> 37:47.360
I had to. If I would've told you
about his power,

37:47.569 --> 37:49.685
you would have come up
with a different plan of attack.

37:49.849 --> 37:52.522
And Litvack would have known it.
He's telepathic, remember.

37:52.729 --> 37:55.038
So you had to believe
I double-crossed you,

37:55.209 --> 37:56.437
so he'd believe it too.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.924
How did you know
Prue would figure it out in time?

37:59.529 --> 38:02.043
We trust each other.

38:11.529 --> 38:15.317
It's strange, isn't it,
being back where we started?

38:16.249 --> 38:19.639
What is stranger to me
is that I'm still here.

38:19.809 --> 38:21.208
I know.

38:21.409 --> 38:24.321
It was really good of you
to call Morris.

38:25.609 --> 38:28.362
I have to go back,
it's the right thing to do.

38:28.529 --> 38:30.918
Much as I'd prefer not to.

38:32.329 --> 38:35.526
Listen, I don't know
how much time we have so...

38:36.409 --> 38:38.684
...I really want to apologize.
- Don't.

38:39.409 --> 38:41.240
I'm not sorry at all.

38:52.169 --> 38:54.683
This is really the awkward part,
you know?

38:54.889 --> 38:59.405
- Tell me about it.
- Well, next time I'll call first, huh?

39:03.569 --> 39:05.480
Thank you for saving my life.

39:06.609 --> 39:08.600
Thank you for changing mine.

39:34.249 --> 39:36.524
What can I get for you?

39:38.409 --> 39:41.242
So who do you think is The Source
that Litvack was talking about?

39:41.449 --> 39:44.759
I don't wanna know.
And, boy, did we read Bane wrong.

39:45.369 --> 39:47.599
Not surprising.
We read all the signs wrong.

39:47.809 --> 39:50.004
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:50.169 --> 39:51.238
How'd it go?

39:52.529 --> 39:55.919
Well, the cops came
and took him away a little while ago,

39:56.089 --> 39:57.761
so everything's back as it should be.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.328
Are you okay?

39:59.489 --> 40:02.799
I'm fine. He thanked me
for changing his life.

40:03.849 --> 40:05.441
You must have been a really good...

40:05.849 --> 40:10.365
- Influence on him.
- Yes, well, the influence was mutual.

40:10.529 --> 40:12.759
So how did you guys find me anyway?

40:14.289 --> 40:18.407
I cast a little spell
to help Piper find her love.

40:18.609 --> 40:21.077
It was supposed to help her decide
between Dan and Leo.

40:21.289 --> 40:24.804
But it led us to you.
Naked, I might add.

40:24.969 --> 40:26.846
I want you to know
I tried to stop her.

40:27.049 --> 40:30.280
Yeah, and you probably would've too,
if you weren't busy getting kidnapped.

40:30.969 --> 40:34.723
Yeah. So, what was the outcome?
Dan or Leo?

40:37.529 --> 40:40.248
I never needed a sign
to tell me where my heart lies.
