01:14.880 --> 01:20.040
Thank you and coming up
in this incredibly
exciting show:

01:37.440 --> 01:40.360
However...

01:40.400 --> 01:43.560
However, we begin
with a film from James May,

01:43.600 --> 01:45.120
who's in his 80s.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.520
-What?
-(LAUGHTER)

01:46.560 --> 01:48.080
No, wait, sorry.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.920
We begin with a film from
James May about the '80s.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.240
Yes. Thank you.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.680
The '80s, a time of
marvellous excess -

01:54.720 --> 01:56.720
you know, Gordon Gekko
and big shoulder pads

01:56.760 --> 01:58.680
and of course
incredible supercars -

01:58.720 --> 02:01.040
the greatest of which,
without question,

02:01.080 --> 02:02.520
was this one.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.160
The Ferrari Testarossa...

02:11.320 --> 02:13.240
...was excess on wheels...

...be it looks...

02:19.680 --> 02:21.160

02:23.160 --> 02:24.440
...or even size.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.160
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

02:31.240 --> 02:34.160
When this car came out,
people were absolutely aghast

02:34.240 --> 02:37.000
at how wide this car was.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.800
I don't mean wide
like Del Boy,

02:38.840 --> 02:41.720
I mean wide as in width.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.680
It was enormous!
Especially at the back.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.680
And it simply oozed charisma

02:46.720 --> 02:49.400
from every one
of its slatted panels.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.920
It was unquestionably...

02:51.960 --> 02:55.160
...the only car that
could star in Miami Vice.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.200
(MIAMI VICE THEME)

02:57.240 --> 03:01.320
In fact, Enzo Ferrari
loved that show so much,

03:01.360 --> 03:04.600
he actually gave its star,
Don Johnson,

03:04.640 --> 03:06.640
his own Testarossa.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.080
And Don was just the tip
of the celebrity iceberg.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.560
Rod Stewart had one,
Elton John had one,

03:16.600 --> 03:18.600
Mike Tyson had one,

03:18.640 --> 03:21.320
OJ Simpson had one.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.200
And presumably
wore driving gloves.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.200
The price of this car,
when it went on sale in 1985,

03:28.240 --> 03:32.840
was Â£62,666.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.640
That is,
as I'm sure you know,
the number of the beast.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.800
And, when you unleashed
its five-litre V12...

03:38.840 --> 03:40.200
(ENGINE REVVING)

03:42.320 --> 03:44.720
...it would do
180 miles an hour.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.000
That was an astonishing
figure for the time.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.760
It had the speed
and the celebrity fan base.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.440
But the Testarossa was not
what you'd call politically
correct.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.720
Consider, for example,
that the window switches

04:05.760 --> 04:09.200
are tiny little things hidden
here on the centre console.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.840
Where you'd expect
them to be,

04:10.880 --> 04:14.160
that...well, obviously,
it's a huge ashtray.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.560
In fact, if they'd given
that a mirrored lid,

04:16.600 --> 04:18.600
it could have had two uses.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.920
If the 1980s were
the era of excess, then,

04:25.920 --> 04:28.560
well, this was
the perfect car for the era.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.920
I'm afraid Mr May has just
been wasting your time rather

04:36.000 --> 04:39.200
because that is not
the ultimate '80s supercar.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.920
This is.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.560
For sheer over-the-topness,

04:45.600 --> 04:49.160
nothing comes close to
the Lamborghini Countach.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.040
Alongside it,

04:53.080 --> 04:55.360
the Testarossa looks
like a family hatchback.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.920
If you think
the Ferrari is wide,

04:58.920 --> 05:02.920
this is even wider.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.240
And the Testarossa's doors
don't open like this.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.000
(ENGINE REVVING)

05:11.080 --> 05:13.680
This version of the Countach,
the LP5000,

05:13.720 --> 05:16.520
was launched in 1985,

05:16.560 --> 05:20.160
specifically to put the
Testarossa back in its box.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.640
Its 48-valve,
5.2 litre-V12...

05:27.240 --> 05:30.200
...can take the Countach
to 186 miles an hour,

05:30.240 --> 05:34.400
or to be precise,
more than the Ferrari.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.400
In fact, in its day, this was
the fastest production car
in the world.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.120
I've got a Kevlar bonnet,

05:42.160 --> 05:46.040

05:47.320 --> 05:49.560
We're talking
ultimate supercar here.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.320
And this incredible
machine...

05:55.360 --> 05:59.480
...came from a company
that didn't have half
the resources of Ferrari.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.600
Let me give you an example.

06:02.640 --> 06:06.640
This car might look
super aerodynamic,
like a missile.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.560
But in fact, it never saw
the inside of a wind tunnel.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.600
They couldn't afford
to put it in one.

06:11.640 --> 06:15.600
So instead, they ran
a prototype up and down
the motorway,

06:15.640 --> 06:17.560
with bits of wool
stuck all over it.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.200
I love that!

06:23.440 --> 06:25.560
Oh, hello. Here he comes.

that Lamborghini is,

06:39.880 --> 06:42.920
it's a bit "all mouth
and no trousers."

06:42.960 --> 06:44.960
Fastest car in the world,

06:48.960 --> 06:51.680
Even Lamborghini will admit
they ran slightly hooky cars

06:51.720 --> 06:53.600
when they did
the performance testing.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.920
They took the mirrors off and
stripped weight out of them.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.640
Absolute flim-flam.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.600
(TYRES SCREECH)

07:03.400 --> 07:05.400
The thing is,
supercars, to me,

07:05.440 --> 07:07.840
are all about
being the ultimate.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.880
It doesn't matter what
that is, but it has to be
an ultimate.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.320
And this is the ultimate

one of these as a kid,

07:19.120 --> 07:21.600
it lit a flame in my heart.

And when I saw one today,
as a middle-aged man,

roared into life.

The problem is, the
Lamborghini Countach
wasn't really a car.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.280
It wasn't really for
driving...but this was.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.080
It's got a proper boot,
a decent-sized fuel tank,

07:54.120 --> 07:55.600
it's got comfortable seats.

Oh, that's not...

in there.

can you?

had a periscope.

There's a cool thing
I can do here.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.520
If you sit here
like...this...

08:40.520 --> 08:44.200
...and then you can put it
in reverse, there...

-Yes, it is moving. Yes, yes.

-I look pretty cool.

-I'm in my car but not--
-Bit of left hand down.

-What? Oh, yeah.
-Left hand down.

It's that cool. Yeah.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.520
I was just explaining to the
viewers before we stopped

09:04.520 --> 09:06.080
what a sham this car is.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.120
That rear wing has no effect

09:08.160 --> 09:10.720
other than
to slow the car down

09:10.760 --> 09:13.080
and make the front go light
when you're at high speed.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.120
It's actually worse than that
cos it's illegal.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.000
They didn't have the money
to homologate it properly.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.040
So they'd build the cars
in the factory

09:20.080 --> 09:21.760
then wheel them out
into the car park

09:21.760 --> 09:23.440
and a man screwed them on
with a power drill.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.520
Genuinely.
And I love that about it!

-In the car park?
-In the car park,
finished it off. I love that!

09:28.400 --> 09:31.840
Why don't we tell the viewers
how the indicator stalk on
your supercar...

09:31.880 --> 09:34.480
(LAUGHING) ...comes
from a Morris Marina?

09:34.520 --> 09:36.200
Well, why don't
we talk about the fact

09:36.240 --> 09:39.040
that the electric door mirror
adjustors on yours

09:39.080 --> 09:41.600
are out of an Austin Montego?

-I was hoping
you didn't know that.
-I did.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.880
Ahem. Rod Stewart
had a Testarossa.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.640
Rod Stewart had a Countach.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.720
Oh, yeah.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.600
JAMES:
Unable to agree on anything,

09:54.640 --> 09:56.880
we decided to take a more
intellectual approach...

09:58.520 --> 10:00.640
...by having a drag race.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.280
Now, on paper,
the Lamborghini is faster,
definitely.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.280
But as we've already
observed,

10:06.320 --> 10:09.040
Lamborghini were a bit
fast and loose with
their performance figures

10:09.080 --> 10:10.520
back in the day.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.400
So now, finally,
we can find out for real.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.520
However,
as we sat on the start line,

10:17.520 --> 10:20.760
something occurred to us.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.480
These are privately owned
cars, aren't they?

10:22.520 --> 10:23.960
RICHARD: Correct, yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.520
Well, the thing is,

10:25.600 --> 10:27.600
Testarossas don't really
like standing starts,

10:27.640 --> 10:30.880
cos they tend to blow
their own differentials up.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.280
How much is
a new differential?

10:33.320 --> 10:37.160
It's Â£26,000.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.200
Actually, I'm quite glad
you've mentioned that.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.240
Because these don't like
standing starts either.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.280
It's those huge rear tyres.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.720
You get a fried clutch
and a split gearbox casing.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.880
JAMES:
How much does that cost?

10:47.880 --> 10:50.200
-Â£36,000.
-Ooh!

10:50.240 --> 10:55.360
So, in all,
that's Â£62,000 at risk.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.240
I know. I fancy something
we don't normally do -

10:58.280 --> 11:00.280
a rolling start drag race.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.680
Yes, I do too! I've always
wanted to try a rolling
start drag race.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.000
And for some reason,
today in these cars,
I prefer that option.

And then,
at the white line, floor it.

The Countach.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.440
The steering feels like
it's set in concrete,

12:35.480 --> 12:37.680
so does the gear lever,
so do the pedals.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.360
And if you use
the air conditioning,

12:39.400 --> 12:42.280
it's like you're being
breathed on by a hot dog.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.680
(LAUGHTER)

12:43.720 --> 12:45.640
He is right about that.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.560
And you can't talk either,
cos your roly-poly barge
Testarossa

12:49.600 --> 12:53.560
was, as you said, driven
by a man from Miami Vice

12:53.600 --> 12:55.600
who rolled
his jacket sleeves up.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.160
The Duke of Edinburgh
doesn't do that, does he?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.360
-Earl Haig doesn't do that.
-Hang on a minute!

13:00.400 --> 13:02.800
-What?
-By attacking those cars,

13:02.840 --> 13:04.840
you are destroying
the very foundations

13:04.880 --> 13:07.040
of everything we love
and hold precious.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.160
Mm-hm. And now it's time
to destroy them
a little bit more

13:10.200 --> 13:14.440
by seeing how slowly those
cars go round The Eboladrome.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.760
(ENGINE REVS)

13:16.800 --> 13:19.800
And it's off in a
clutch-slipping, smoky start.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.840
Ooh, it's wet.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.440
And look at that lunging
and pitching there.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.240
As she heads on to the Isn't.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.840
Having a look at the gear
lever, make sure
it hasn't fallen off.

13:30.880 --> 13:34.120
Sleeves very sensibly
rolled down.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.920
Look at the body roll on it.
Here we go.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.640
Oh, she's fighting
the wheel there.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.880
More lean, as she lunges down
to Your Name Here.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.720
It really is dodge,
duck, dip, dive.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.800
It's like watching Dodgeball,
only slower.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.680
And less amusing.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.720
Another glance down
at the gear lever.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.280
And now ringing out
that flat 12.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.480
Powerboating back towards
Old Lady's House

14:02.520 --> 14:04.440
in a wake of spray.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.880
I can't imagine
she's enjoying this.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.360
Right, hard on the brakes.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.360
Taking a wisely cautious
line in there.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.480
Has it stopped?
No, still moving, just.

14:15.520 --> 14:20.680
And now, yeah, lumbering
towards Substation.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.520
In fairness,
it does sound quite good.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.920
(ENGINE ROARS)

14:23.960 --> 14:25.960
Very good, actually.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.800
Wallowing through there
like a Rolls-Royce Corniche.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.840
Just Field of Sheep to go.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.880
Yes, she's sliding it!

14:32.920 --> 14:34.840
And across the line.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.320
-She's nuts.
-That was absolutely nuts.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.080
Sliding a Testarossa -
I wouldn't do that
for all the tea in China.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.240
Technical point that might
confuse the viewers.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.520
You just said,
"The roar from the flat 12,"

14:49.560 --> 14:51.800
which is sort of right
but I said, "V12,"

14:51.840 --> 14:53.920
which is also sort of right,
cos it's not a boxer.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.480
So it's a 180-degree
flat V12.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.800
-Like that.
-Literally not interested.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.880
-It's a flat--
-(LAUGHTER)

14:59.920 --> 15:01.160
It's a flattish V12.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.240
Anyway, it's now time to
see how the Lambo got on.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.280
(ENGINE REVVING)

15:06.320 --> 15:09.680
And it's a snappier start
for the Countach,

15:09.720 --> 15:13.720
mashing its fat rear tyres
into that sodden Tarmac.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.560
It really is sodden.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.120
A quick look down to make
sure it's in gear there.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.800
Now easing off through the
second curve on the straight.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.600
And back on the power
towards Your Name here.

15:26.640 --> 15:30.320
No need for Abbie
to go to the gym this week.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.160
She's getting all the workout
she needs in the Lambo.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.920
Turning in hard as she dare.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.040
Rear wing doing
absolutely nothing as usual.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.160
Ooh, I thought it
was gonna take off there!

15:46.200 --> 15:50.240
And now the joyless
wrestle back towards
Old Lady's House.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.240
Through the rain.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.720
A rush of the brakes, I felt,
at the mid-point there.

15:57.760 --> 16:01.760
Now, much harder braking
and down through the gears.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.960
It sounded like an angry
tractor at low revs.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.920
And now in the damp dash
towards Substation.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.240
(ENGINE REVVING)

16:09.280 --> 16:10.760
That makes an even
better noise

16:10.800 --> 16:13.000
than the Ferrari, really.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.040
Brilliant.
Just two corners left.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.040
Will she get this one
sliding in Field of Sheep?

16:18.080 --> 16:21.360
Bit of a wiggle there but
through the Field of Sheep?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.320
No, and there we are,
across the line!

16:25.840 --> 16:27.760
-Brave.
-Brave.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.760
Right.

16:31.800 --> 16:35.760
Let's see where they go on
the board, Lamborghini first.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.720
RICHARD: Hang on, that's
the bottom of the board.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.520
JEREMY: They're not going
to the top, are they?

16:39.560 --> 16:41.640
See, look at that.
30th place.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.160
It's faster than
a Ford Fiesta.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.200
I mean, come on.
That's pretty good.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.480
JEREMY:
That is tragically slow!

16:47.520 --> 16:51.080
-It was a long time ago!
-(JAMES LAUGHS)

16:51.120 --> 16:53.160
It doesn't look good,
does it?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.120
Honda Civic, Ford Focus -
they're all quicker.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.320
All right, one good thing is,

16:58.360 --> 17:00.920
the Testarossa can't be
much slower than that.
Let's find out.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.080
-(LAUGHTER)
RICHARD: My God!

17:06.360 --> 17:08.240
Oh, God!

17:08.280 --> 17:09.960
It is faster than the Up!

17:10.000 --> 17:11.680
And they're both in the wet
so that's a fair comparison.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.720
Loser, I believe.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.800
JEREMY: Look, I think
we have to face facts here.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.800
They're two very slow cars.

17:17.880 --> 17:21.440
But at least
they are expensive

17:21.480 --> 17:24.680
and horrible to drive.

17:24.720 --> 17:29.480
Anyway, now it's time to
bite into a cake of debate,

17:29.520 --> 17:32.640
from the cafÃ© of chat...

17:32.680 --> 17:36.040
...on the corner of
Conversation Street.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.000
(MELLOW JAZZ)

17:40.080 --> 17:41.520
(LAUGHTER)

17:48.960 --> 17:52.240
I think after 36 of those
we are running out of ideas.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.080
It was getting desperate.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.160
Now, any young people here,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.200
looking forward
to driving maybe one day?

17:58.240 --> 18:01.560
Thinking the future holds a
Ferrari for you, Lamborghini.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.560
Afraid not.
There's a company in Aberdeen

18:03.640 --> 18:07.080
who've decided that
the future actually will
look like this.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.800
RICHARD: Oh, God.
-(LAUGHTER)

18:08.800 --> 18:10.560
JAMES: Bloody hell.
RICHARD: Really?

18:10.560 --> 18:12.040
JAMES: Electric?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.320
JEREMY: Of course
they're electric, obviously.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.400
Range of 35 miles.
They're stackable cars.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.920
Wait, so they work like the
human centipede, then?

18:19.960 --> 18:21.960
(LAUGHTER)

18:22.000 --> 18:24.040
Not exactly like that, no.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.920
No. No...

18:25.960 --> 18:28.040
No.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.080
What I mean is, they're all
connected together.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.080
Yeah, they're connected,
exactly. They're connected.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.040
Hang on, what if you're in
the one in the middle, right?

18:35.080 --> 18:38.080
And you want to go
a different way
to the one in the front.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.760
What are you gonna do?

18:39.800 --> 18:42.040
It's worse than that.
If you're in the middle

18:42.080 --> 18:43.800
and go a different way,
you won't have any wheels.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.000
They'll be left attached
to the ones in the front
and back.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.000
RICHARD:
There's not enough wheels.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.760
I grant you, it looks
ridiculous that the front
and back separate.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.800
"We've got no bloody wheels!"

18:52.800 --> 18:54.720
Actually, it's an optical
illusion, the back wheels
are inboard.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.320
So you do have wheels.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.200
But what if
you were in the back one

18:58.240 --> 19:00.440
and it was being driven
by Richard Hammond
from the front?

19:00.480 --> 19:02.400
-You'd be bloody terrified.
-Oh, all right!

19:03.480 --> 19:05.000
Yes, that is a point.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.440
But I don't think you quite
understand how this works.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.040
I'll need to check it out.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.880
It's quite complicated
so bear with me.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.800
You see, the idea is these
cars are sort of everywhere
for people to use.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.720
And then at night, a man
goes round in the green one,
the one in front,

19:20.760 --> 19:22.920
and he collects all the
others up behind him.

19:22.960 --> 19:26.080
He's a bit like those men
you see at airports,
with all the trolleys,

19:26.080 --> 19:29.240
and he ends up with that
two-mile snake that bashes
into your ankles.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.440
-It's like that.
-So it gathers them all up?

19:31.480 --> 19:34.040
So, hang on a minute.
You drive home
in the evening, say.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.920
-Mm-hm.
-In your car.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.080
You get up next morning
but it's gone because
a bloke's collected it?

19:38.080 --> 19:40.800
-(LAUGHTER)
-Yeah.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.240
That doesn't work
because most journeys
by car are two-way.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.160
You get there,
then you need to get back.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.080
Unless you're driving
to Dignitas.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.280
No, they'd work for that.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.440
Maybe it's a Dignitas
collection service.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.320
The thing is, I'm going to
try and work out how it...

19:55.400 --> 19:58.720
It's quite complicated.
They have actually...

19:58.760 --> 20:02.000
There is a flow chart that
explains how it works.
Put that up.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.520
-Here we are.
RICHARD: Oh, I see!

20:04.560 --> 20:07.560
You're stabbed in the back
with a giant fork,
and briefcase,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.800
then you bump into
one-and-two-thirds cars,

20:10.800 --> 20:14.320
that turn into half a car,
that crash into a picture of
a train...

20:14.320 --> 20:16.560
This makes no sense at all!

20:16.560 --> 20:19.240
No, hang on a minute. You've
got that wrong, haven't you?

20:19.280 --> 20:22.400
You get into two cars
but only drive off in
three-quarters of one.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.440
And you go to the station,
because presumably
you're going somewhere,

20:25.480 --> 20:27.760
but whilst you're going
somewhere, somebody
takes it and puts it back.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.080
You get back to the station
you haven't got a bloody car!

20:30.160 --> 20:31.320
That doesn't work!

20:31.320 --> 20:33.320
No, what they're saying is,

20:33.400 --> 20:36.560
the future is going to be
very inconvenient.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.040
Yeah, it sounds that way.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.000
That's basically
what they're actually saying.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.080
I've got a blindingly good
idea, I'd like to run this
by you...

20:43.160 --> 20:45.040
-Sure.
-...in a committee fashion.

20:45.080 --> 20:48.240
What if...
we had a car of our own.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.400
You could buy it or lease it,
but it was, like, your car.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.440
And then...
No, it's crazy, I know.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.160
Then there'd be
a pretty good chance

20:55.200 --> 20:57.560
it would be wherever it was
when you last left it...

20:57.640 --> 21:00.280
-when you came back to it.
-So all these people -

21:00.320 --> 21:01.920
you've left cars in
the car park here, have you?

21:01.960 --> 21:04.800
-So they'd still be there...
-That's exactly it!

21:04.800 --> 21:07.240
They won't have
been collected up
by a random stranger.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.240
Imagine this - you go out
and your car's still there.
Brilliant.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.880
Let me run with that,
if I may.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.960
What if you could run
these cars on a kind of
magic juice?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.640
(LAUGHTER)

21:16.680 --> 21:18.320
Takes two or three minutes
to replenish them,

21:18.400 --> 21:20.000
you go hundreds of miles.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.320
-What magic juice?
-Well, you could
get it from underground.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.680
-What's it made of?
-Squashed prawns?

21:25.720 --> 21:27.320
(LAUGHTER)

21:27.320 --> 21:29.320
It's all sounding a bit
improbable, mate.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.400
Well, let's take on the
company from Aberdeen

21:31.440 --> 21:34.400
and see who gets it
more right.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.320
Can I talk about
Robert Kubica?

21:36.320 --> 21:39.240
Polish Formula One driver,
there's a picture of him now.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.200
A few years ago,
eight years ago actually,

21:41.240 --> 21:44.320
he had a terrible accident
while doing a spot of
rallying for fun.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.440
That was the car.
You see the crash barrier
went into the car.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.080
Broke every single bone on
the right side of his body,

21:50.160 --> 21:52.400
everything from his heel
to his shoulder.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.960
Had a seven-hour operation
to put his arm back on again,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.560
and then 17 more operations
after that.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.400
And his arm still
doesn't work properly,

22:00.440 --> 22:03.480
but this weekend he is back
in a Formula One car.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.520
And I'd just like say,
that's bloody brilliant.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.560
What a man!

22:07.600 --> 22:09.320
RICHARD: Determination.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.760
Like um...

22:13.240 --> 22:15.960
Mark Webber, OK,
the Aussie F1 guy,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.720
former F1 guy,

22:17.760 --> 22:19.920
he welcomed him back to
Formula One by tweeting:

22:19.960 --> 22:21.840
(IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
"Poland's man is coming back,

22:21.880 --> 22:24.840
what a warrior
and tenacious prick he is."

22:24.880 --> 22:27.200
Now, to be fair, to be fair
for an Australian,

22:27.240 --> 22:29.200
that is getting quite
soppy and sentimental.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.560
"Ah, yeah, he's a prick."

22:31.600 --> 22:33.840
Oh, now.
As I'm sure you know,

22:33.880 --> 22:35.840
there's a lot of work
going on at the moment

22:35.880 --> 22:37.880
with sort of electric cars,
driverless cars

22:37.920 --> 22:40.120
-and the future of
transportation and so on.
-Yes, we have noticed.

22:40.160 --> 22:43.320
Exactly. All I want is
something that stops things

22:43.360 --> 22:45.840
falling down the side
of the seat when
you're driving along.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.680
I want the car I've got now,

22:47.720 --> 22:49.720
but just something that
stops that happening.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.920
-That's it?
-That is the sum total
of your ambition?

22:51.960 --> 22:53.520
Yes, it is--

22:53.560 --> 22:55.600
At this period of fundamental
change in the whole concept

22:55.640 --> 22:58.640
of car ownership, car usage,
car functionality...

22:58.680 --> 23:01.160
Mm-hm, that's all I want,
something that...

23:01.200 --> 23:03.600
Cos they say it's dangerous
to tweet when you're driving.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.080
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.440
Driving along like that,

23:06.480 --> 23:08.240
and "Oh, no, I've dropped
my phone down there."

23:08.280 --> 23:10.320
You've got the seat lifted,
your head's squashed,

23:10.360 --> 23:12.360
you're desperately shoving
your hand down there,

23:12.400 --> 23:15.520
shoving it in, all the skin's
been peeled back at the side.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.000
"I'll get it, I'll get it."

23:17.040 --> 23:20.160
-"Like a...
Like a determined vet.
-Exactly!

23:20.200 --> 23:22.000
Exactly!

23:22.040 --> 23:24.440
-(LAUGHTER)
-Not exactly.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.720
-Sort of, like...
-"Come on, mole, give birth!"

23:26.760 --> 23:28.240
(GRUNTS) "It's burst!"

23:28.280 --> 23:30.520
Why can't we just
have a little bit of a f...

23:30.560 --> 23:33.880
I mean, I'm doing it on this
side because we're all
British, but whatever side.

23:33.920 --> 23:39.000
A little flap of material
that stops things going down.
I mean, how hard can that be?

23:39.040 --> 23:41.120
I know what you mean,
it is an issue.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.800
I once looked under
the driver seat of my 911,
and you'll remember this,

23:44.840 --> 23:47.400
I found eight pairs of
sunglasses I'd lost
and replaced.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.120
-He did.
-Just all under there.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.360
There's house keys,
ingots, relatives.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.080
There's also...
And eventually you
do drop something.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.680
You know what it's like
when you drop something
and you think,

23:55.720 --> 23:57.960
"I really do need to get that
back," so you have to stop.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.440
And then you can't get it
from here or from here.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.440
So then you have to go
round the back,

24:02.480 --> 24:04.040
and you can never
quite get in properly,

24:04.080 --> 24:05.800
so you've got your hand
under it like this.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.280
And there's always... There's
always what feels like

24:09.320 --> 24:11.720
a bit of furry mucus.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.760
No, there is! There is,
there is! You've seen it!

24:13.800 --> 24:15.800
-That is always there.
-Like a hairy tumour.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.200
And it's squidgy,
and you go...

24:17.240 --> 24:19.560
There always,
always is one of those,

24:19.600 --> 24:22.880
and it's always, always
on top of whatever it was
you lost.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.320
Do you know, the Holy Grail
will probably turn up

24:25.360 --> 24:27.360
-under somebody's
driving seat.
-It will.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.240
I tell you what, if you went
underneath everybody's seat,

24:30.280 --> 24:32.600
if you all tonight
when you go back to the car,

24:32.640 --> 24:34.280
have a look
under your car seats,

24:34.320 --> 24:37.760
you will find enough loose
change to pay for Brexit.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.440
(LAUGHTER)

24:39.480 --> 24:41.320
It could do it,
it could tip it.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.040
We could pretty much pay
the whole lot. Who's with me?

24:44.080 --> 24:46.760
AUDIENCE: Yes.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.800
There you go, you see,
people applauded...

24:48.840 --> 24:50.320
Well, three people
applauded my idea.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.920
(LAUGHTER)

24:51.960 --> 24:53.480
-James?
-What?

24:53.520 --> 24:55.600
-Interesting news.
RICHARD: Oh, God!

24:55.640 --> 24:57.360
What do you mean, "Oh, God"?

24:57.400 --> 25:00.320
Well, whenever one of you
two says, "Interesting news"

25:00.360 --> 25:02.160
it turns out to be
about the war.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.320
-No, this...
isn't about the war.
-(LAUGHTER)

25:05.360 --> 25:07.400
This is interesting news about
the speed of different birds.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.440
-Oh, that's even worse!
-Oh, I love this.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.480
We've talked
about this before?

25:11.520 --> 25:14.320
They've been going on about
this ever since he claimed

25:14.360 --> 25:16.560
to have clocked a pigeon
doing 25 miles an hour.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.960
I did. I was driving
alongside, there was
a pigeon that was doing 25.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.360
Anyway, a Swiss speed camera
has clocked a duck...

25:25.400 --> 25:27.440
It's clocked a duck,
it's actually triggered
the camera.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.480
Got a picture here,
look, proving it.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.400
JAMES: Look at that!
-And it took a picture
of a duck.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.760
JAMES: How fast was it going?
JEREMY: 32 miles an hour.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.120
JAMES: There you go.
That's quite incredible.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.720
Cos if I was asked, I'd say
a duck would do 20 or 21--

25:40.760 --> 25:44.440
It's not quite incredible,
neither is it remotely
interesting!

25:44.480 --> 25:46.680
It is interesting!
It's a piece of knowledge,
Hammond!

25:46.720 --> 25:50.520
How can the world be a poorer
place for having a bit more
knowledge in it?

25:50.560 --> 25:52.480
-Exactly.
-Because that knowledge

25:52.520 --> 25:57.280
is peculiar and strange,
and doesn't matter
a bugger to anybody.

25:57.320 --> 26:00.680
You're not gonna be
mocking when you're Buttons
in the panto in Swindon

26:00.720 --> 26:03.320
and Jeremy and I are
waving at each other
from our super yachts

26:03.360 --> 26:05.520
because of the global success
of our television series

26:05.560 --> 26:08.240
James And Jeremy's
The Speed Of Birds.

26:08.280 --> 26:11.280
-It's gonna be
absolutely massive.
-Who'd watch that?

26:11.320 --> 26:13.280
Come on, who'd watch
The Speed Of Birds?

26:13.320 --> 26:15.840
Who wants to see him
as Buttons at
the Swindon Wyvern?

26:15.880 --> 26:17.800
-Me.
-(CHEERING)

26:19.640 --> 26:22.600
No! Never!

26:22.640 --> 26:25.760
-I think that marks the end
of Conversation Street.
JEREMY: Yes.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
I think it does.
I think I'll move it on,

26:27.840 --> 26:32.640
because all of us agree that
we do love a hot hatchback.

26:32.680 --> 26:36.160
Yeah, we love that they're
practical, cheap to run,
cheap to repair,

26:36.200 --> 26:38.400
but they still go like
demented baboons.

26:38.440 --> 26:42.200
Yeah, and now there's
a new breed of small
hot hatchback.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.120
And to find which one is
best, we took The Grand Tour

26:45.160 --> 26:48.080
to that field
just over there.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.600
Yes, the start point
for our test

26:53.640 --> 26:56.200
was our own track
in Oxfordshire.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.960
And this is what
we'd assembled.

27:00.440 --> 27:03.720
I've brought
the new Volkswagen Polo GTI,

27:03.760 --> 27:06.960
which has 197 horsepower.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
Richard Hammond has brought
the new Ford Fiesta ST,

27:11.040 --> 27:15.040
which also has
197 horsepower.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.680
James May has brought
the new Toyota Yaris,

27:18.720 --> 27:21.040
which has a ridiculous name,

27:21.080 --> 27:23.000
the "Grmn".

27:24.200 --> 27:26.120
Grmm-nn...

27:26.160 --> 27:28.000
Grmn. How do you say that?
Grmm-nn...

27:28.040 --> 27:29.760
Grumuna.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.960
It isn't Grumuna,
there's no "a" at the end.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.960
It says "Grmn".

27:34.000 --> 27:36.400
-It is a funny name.
-What does it mean, Grmn?

27:36.440 --> 27:40.320
Gazoo Racing
Meisters of the Nurburgring.

27:40.360 --> 27:43.040
-Oh! Your favourite place!
-That's where it was
developed.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.040
JEREMY:
And what is Gazoo Racing?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.080
JAMES: Gazoo Racing is
Toyota's racing division.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.520
This has been done
by a small group of people

27:49.560 --> 27:51.320
dedicating themselves
over two years

27:51.360 --> 27:53.080
to making this
the perfect hot hatch.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.920
Stiffened body shell, shorter
springs, SACHS dampers.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.760
It's got a supercharger, it's
got special forged wheels,

27:58.800 --> 28:01.440
it's got special tyres, it's
got stiffened anti-roll bars.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.480
It's even got a different
steering rack from the
standard Yaris.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.560
That's proper
hot-hatch technology.

28:06.600 --> 28:10.280
My car is just over Â£21,000,
yours is what?

28:10.320 --> 28:12.640
RICHARD: Just shy of Â£20,000.
JEREMY: Just under Â£20,000.

28:12.680 --> 28:15.280
Over Â£26,000.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.960
And worth every penny,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.360
because it's properly
developed as a hot hatchback.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.400
RICHARD:
It's not a pretty car.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.920
JAMES: I think it is.
JEREMY: It's put make-up
on one eye.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.120
Slightly mad make-up
on one eye, it's like Kiss.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.480
It's like watching my
daughters get ready
in the morning.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.960
"Am I done?"
"Yeah, you're done."

28:30.000 --> 28:31.280
Yours is a brown car.

28:31.320 --> 28:33.080
-It's not brown!
-That is brown.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.520
-Oh, yeah, it is.
-It isn't, it's mushroom.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.200
The cameramen know
about colour. Is it brown?

28:37.240 --> 28:38.920
-It's brown.
CAMERAMAN:
It's definitely brown.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.440
It's mushroom!

28:41.480 --> 28:44.200
JEREMY: At this point,
we decided
that instead of arguing

28:44.240 --> 28:47.720
about which car was best, we
should do some actual tests,

28:47.760 --> 28:51.640
starting with a pursuit race.

28:51.680 --> 28:55.120
Each of us was spaced
at equal distances
around the track

28:55.160 --> 28:57.080
and the rules were simple.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.640
When you're overtaken
by the car behind...

29:00.800 --> 29:03.240
...James is out.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.000
Can I just ask, why am
I starting on the gravel,

29:06.040 --> 29:08.880
on a bend, when you two
are on Tarmac?

29:08.920 --> 29:10.920
-Have you got launch control?
-No.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.200
Well, that's your look-out,
then, isn't it? I have.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.080
-(CHUCKLES)
-All right, what-evs.
Let's go.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.320
Launch control active!
I'm ready.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.080
(ENGINE REVVING)

29:24.160 --> 29:27.120
RADIO: Three, two, one, go!

29:30.720 --> 29:33.280
Ooh, and we are away!

29:37.160 --> 29:38.160
Aw.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.920
It's a lively little thing,
this.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.600
Let's not forget, shall we,
that Volkswagen

29:50.640 --> 29:57.040
invented the hot hatchback
and they're still
the best at it.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.920
Take an ordinary hatchback,
stiffen the suspension,

29:59.960 --> 30:02.080
stiffen the body,
give it a big engine.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.120
The end.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.520
Kazoo!

30:06.560 --> 30:09.880
It's nice, it feels taut.
What happens here?

30:09.920 --> 30:11.640
Where does it go?

30:17.080 --> 30:18.800
(TYRES SCREECH)

30:18.840 --> 30:20.760
This is cracking.
I love these.

30:24.680 --> 30:26.680
Those little crackles and
bangs from the exhaust,

30:26.720 --> 30:28.280
it's got valves in it...

30:29.920 --> 30:31.800
...to make it sound good.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.080
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
And into the gravel cell.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.200
It's actually quite funny the
way the tail will slide round

30:45.240 --> 30:47.400
and then you can feel
the brakes grabbing

30:47.440 --> 30:49.360
to stop it
actually spinning.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.200
That way,
you can have lots of fun

30:55.240 --> 30:58.560
without there being
blood or an ambulance.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.360
No, got it wrong, and
I've got Jezza behind me.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.400
The "Grunumunum"
is right in my sights now.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.440
Come on, come on, come on.
This is exciting times now.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.880
Duh! Incorrect.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.320
Ah, that was, I overdid it.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.960
Hard to see where
I'm going now due to
the dust cloud

31:26.000 --> 31:27.920
from the
"Grunumunummmnnmm".

31:31.640 --> 31:34.200
-Whoa!
-Oh, no, Hammond's
catching Clarkson as well.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.040
This is getting
very interesting.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.840
Right, time
to reel Jeremy in.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.200
Come on, come on,
come on, this is...

31:44.240 --> 31:45.600
Too wide.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.680
You're out! Ha ha!

31:48.720 --> 31:50.520
With the roadblock
out of the way,

31:50.560 --> 31:52.840
it became a two-horse
war of attrition.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.000
Come on, Clarkson,
you're mine.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.080
Grip. Grip, grip, grip.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.280
(CACKLES)

32:06.200 --> 32:08.880
Hot hatchbacks
are such a riot!

32:08.920 --> 32:10.840
They really are.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.120
If someone were to say to me
now, "Do you want to get out

32:16.160 --> 32:19.840
and swap into a 911 Turbo
or a 488?"

32:19.880 --> 32:22.920
I'd say, "No, I honestly
do not want to do that."

32:24.000 --> 32:25.120
(CACKLES)

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Oh, bit of lift-off
oversteer.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.880
That's what you want
in a hot hatch.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.200
Several laps later,

32:35.240 --> 32:38.680
both of us were still
the same distance apart.

32:40.800 --> 32:45.640
It's just occurred to me
we both have the same
knowledge of this track,

32:45.680 --> 32:48.000
we both have
197 horsepower.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.440
This race may take a while.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.600
JEREMY: However...
-Brakes are fading, I can
feel them fading a bit.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.120
They do get hot.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.760
JEREMY: Mine meanwhile
had got smoky hot.

33:02.600 --> 33:06.400
So, much to the annoyance
of our colleague...

33:06.440 --> 33:09.400
...we decided
to call it a draw.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.640
Can I just say, if this was
a proper race rather than
a catchy-up race,

33:12.680 --> 33:16.080
I'd be in the lead because I
treated my car properly and
didn't overheat the brakes.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.720
-Have you heard this?
-I did hear that.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.040
You don't pause in a race!

33:19.080 --> 33:21.080
-So if you drive slowly,
you win?
-Yes.

33:21.120 --> 33:24.400
Because my brakes
aren't overheating,
I could still be--

33:24.440 --> 33:26.880
-You never went
more than 28mph!
-Rubbish!

33:26.920 --> 33:30.040
When did you watch a motor
race on the television,
on Grandstand or--

33:30.080 --> 33:35.520
Rather than listen to any
more of May's bizarre
theories on motor sport...

33:35.560 --> 33:38.160
...we decide to move on
to the next challenge.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.320
A drag race.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.800
Let me talk you
through the engine.
It's a two-litre turbo.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.600
What more do you want?

33:48.640 --> 33:51.840
Right, launch control.
I'm ready.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.480
I'm also ready.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.920
James, on the other hand,

33:55.960 --> 33:58.600
has some explaining to do
about his "Grunumm..."

34:00.600 --> 34:02.600
This engine's actually
pretty interesting.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.640
First and foremost, it's been
breathed upon by Lotus.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.080
They actually use a similar
spec engine in the Elise.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.640
But perhaps more
interestingly,
it's supercharged,

34:10.680 --> 34:12.680
which is unusual
in a hot hatchback.

34:12.720 --> 34:15.920
Why bother with a
supercharger? It's heavier
than a turbocharger...

34:21.360 --> 34:23.160
So the headline figures are:

34:23.200 --> 34:25.440
I have the most power,
209 horsepower.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.880
I have the lowest weight,
1,135 kilograms.

34:28.920 --> 34:33.600
And that's over 200 kilograms
lighter than Clarkson's VW.

34:33.640 --> 34:37.600
JEREMY: Eventually
James finished talking
and we were ready to go.

34:38.640 --> 34:40.120
I probably won't win this.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.280
My problem is
I've got the heaviest car

34:42.320 --> 34:44.040
and I'm the heaviest driver.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.160
(BLEEPING)

34:48.680 --> 34:50.160
(BLEEPING)

34:52.160 --> 34:54.080
And we are away.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.360
Where's that bloody Polo
going?

35:07.160 --> 35:08.640
Yes!

35:08.640 --> 35:10.360
Oh, what?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.920
A victory for the fat boy!

35:14.960 --> 35:19.080
That can only mean that VW
have got their figures wrong.

35:19.120 --> 35:21.920
Again.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.040
JEREMY: This surprising
result called for a bit
of a debrief.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
The mushroom-coloured Polo--

35:29.040 --> 35:31.520
-Brown!
-The brown VW has won.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.560
Actually,
I've got to be honest.

35:33.600 --> 35:37.160
I am quite surprised by
its astonishing victory.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.400
It is really annoying. And
there's nothing you can do.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.560
-Cos it's heavy.
-And it's only as powerful
as this.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.600
The DSG gearbox
makes a huge difference.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.160
Yeah, the double clutch.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.200
Every time you two
have to change gear,
you lose 20 yards.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.960
There's no way you can keep
up with an old-fashioned box.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.360
-No, it's one gear,
then another--
-(MESSAGE ALERT)

35:54.400 --> 35:55.960
Oh, hang on.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Text from Mr Wilman.

35:58.040 --> 36:01.480
-"You idiots."
-Nice.
-Not very kind.

36:01.520 --> 36:05.640
"Stop banging on about
double-clutch gearboxes
and lift-off oversteer.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.360
These cars are supposed
to appeal to young people

36:08.400 --> 36:10.480
and they have no idea
what those things are.

36:13.680 --> 36:17.480
The winner of this test will
be the car that appeals most
to millennials,

36:17.520 --> 36:20.600
not old men like you."

36:20.640 --> 36:24.560
So what test do we do
that young people
would be interested?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.920
No, wait, I've had an idea.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.360
JAMES:
What exactly is a millennial?

36:34.040 --> 36:36.920
JEREMY: Once we'd explained
this to James,
we left the test track,

36:36.960 --> 36:41.840
and began our new
youth-friendly road test.

36:41.880 --> 36:47.400
What I've done is I've fitted
some youth-friendly political
stickers on the doors.

36:47.440 --> 36:54.880
And then on the windscreen,
a transgender, fluid,
neutral sunscreen.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.320
The other Jeremy, of course,
is the great Jeremy Corbyn,

36:57.360 --> 36:59.760
leader of the Labour Party,

36:59.800 --> 37:04.320
a man with the same initials
as the Baby Jesus,

37:04.360 --> 37:06.080
one of the prophets of Islam.

37:08.040 --> 37:10.200
Richard, meanwhile,
had for some reason

37:10.280 --> 37:13.640
put the shipping forecast
on the doors of the Fiesta.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.640
Why have you got "Stormy"
on the side of your car?

37:19.640 --> 37:22.840
Cos that's the name of
the rapper that
young people adore.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.400
No, that's Stormzy.

37:24.440 --> 37:29.000
Stormy's that sexual
intercourse enthusiast
in America.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.960
Popular with young people?

37:34.520 --> 37:37.360
JAMES: Meanwhile, I'd headed
for an organic farm shop

37:37.400 --> 37:40.640
to test out
my young-people modification.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.800
What I've fitted to my car -
it's powered by the same
USB port

37:43.840 --> 37:46.480
that you'd normally use to
recharge your vape bong -

37:46.520 --> 37:49.960
is the most important thing
in a millennial's life.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
And that is, of course,
a juicer. Ta-da!

37:53.040 --> 37:58.360
Now, using this, I can make
a whole range of tasty
and nutritious juices

37:58.400 --> 38:01.560
using a variety of
ethically-sound ingredients.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.840
And that means
I won't be beholden

38:03.880 --> 38:07.360
to evil American corporations
that murder baby veals

38:07.400 --> 38:09.880
and snap the beaks
off chickens.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.960
RICHARD: Back on the road,
Jeremy and I were busy
competing

38:16.000 --> 38:19.640
to win the hearts and minds
of the snowflakes.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.960
Because you're young,
you'll care very much
about the environment.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
So you'll be very glad to
know that unlike the Polo
and the Toyota,

38:27.040 --> 38:30.360
this doesn't have
four cylinders -
the Fiesta only has three.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.200
In fact, when it's cruising,

38:32.280 --> 38:35.160
it can deactivate one of them
and go down to two.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.200
That's a world first
on a three-cylinder car.

38:37.280 --> 38:40.960
And what it means is,
it's nicer to polar bears.

38:43.960 --> 38:46.440
The seats in here
are made from cloth,

38:46.480 --> 38:50.080
so no cow was harmed in
the making of the interior.

38:50.120 --> 38:54.120
Apart from a small veal
who was used to make
the steering wheel.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.840
But that's it.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.880
(WHIRRING)

39:01.200 --> 39:04.440
Right, this one is kale,
apple,

39:04.480 --> 39:08.200
line-caught avocado
and ethical water...

39:08.280 --> 39:10.920
plus my reading glasses
which fell in there
earlier on.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.760
But it doesn't matter,
they've got plastic lenses
so they're perfectly safe.

39:17.160 --> 39:18.400
Mm!

39:18.440 --> 39:20.360
Someone's gonna want that.

39:23.120 --> 39:26.040
JEREMY: In order to see if
we were on the right track,

39:26.080 --> 39:28.640
Richard and I had headed
into the wonderful,

39:28.640 --> 39:30.640
anti-car city of Oxford.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.600
Many, many cyclists here.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.160
Look at the way young people
are approving of my car

39:41.200 --> 39:42.920
and my stickers.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.960
Dab on it, wagwam!

39:46.000 --> 39:48.880
I speak the language
of the millennial.

39:48.920 --> 39:52.760
Hammond and May won't be
able to do that, cos they're
in a Ford and a Toyota.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.160
They're bad whips.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.400
You'll see
there's a bus lane here.

39:57.440 --> 40:01.640
And the Fiesta
is showing no sign at all

40:01.640 --> 40:05.960
of complaining that half
the road is completely empty
and unused.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.120
This car has no problem
with that.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.600
JEREMY: There's a couple of
hikers, Hammond, on my left.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.880
I'm not judging them,
cos judging people is wrong.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.840
Oh, cyclist.

40:22.040 --> 40:25.040
-(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVS)
-Maniac!

40:25.080 --> 40:29.600
Having drunk his spectacles,
James was now on the move.

40:29.640 --> 40:32.040
My latest juice has
a bit of an Asian flavour.

40:32.080 --> 40:36.680
Because it's made with okra,
some ground-up dry ginger,

40:36.760 --> 40:40.080
a touch of garlic,
a pinch of garam masala...

40:40.120 --> 40:43.640
and a pork pie.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.400
This car was, of course,
developed at the Nurburgring,

40:46.440 --> 40:48.440
which might sound
not very millennial.

40:48.480 --> 40:52.440
But on the other hand, it is
the world's greenest circuit.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.080
It is completely...

40:54.120 --> 40:56.120
-(SPLASHING)
-Oh, Jesus!

40:56.160 --> 40:58.080
(BRAKES SQUEALING)

41:00.440 --> 41:01.960
God! Agh!

41:03.040 --> 41:04.880
Agh...

41:04.920 --> 41:06.200
Agh.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.160
(SPITS)

41:09.160 --> 41:11.160
Back to the tent.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.600
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

41:13.640 --> 41:16.360
JEREMY:
I've gotta be honest...

41:16.400 --> 41:20.440
Apart from you drinking
plastic, which is evil,

41:20.480 --> 41:23.840
I thought that was all going
rather well, the test
appealing to young people.

41:23.880 --> 41:28.000
Yeah, we talked about carbon
dioxide and polar bears

41:28.040 --> 41:30.040
and expressed our support
for the Labour Party.

41:30.080 --> 41:33.680
Yeah, apart from the bit
where the juicer blew up
in my face, obviously,

41:33.760 --> 41:35.400
it was all going rather
excellently, we thought.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.120
It was, yeah.

41:37.160 --> 41:40.440
Unfortunately, Mr Wilman
said we hadn't got
the idea at all.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.160
-No.
-And that to really appeal
to millennials,

41:43.160 --> 41:46.840
we had to somehow get
our cars in The Mail Online.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.080
Now this was a bit of
a problem for James,

41:49.120 --> 41:52.160
-who claims he's never read
The Mail Online.
-I haven't.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.880
You're not really The Mail's
target audience, James.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.760
What do you mean by that?

41:56.800 --> 42:00.920
You're not a mealy-mouthed
bitter person...

42:00.960 --> 42:04.200
...who believes
that everyone who is
luckier, better-looking,

42:04.280 --> 42:07.680
richer and more talented
than you are should be torn
to shreds and executed.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.160
(LAUGHTER)

42:09.160 --> 42:12.440
Right, well, whatever,
the rules were simple.

42:12.480 --> 42:16.840
We had to drive into London
and then do something
with our cars

42:16.880 --> 42:19.800
that would get the paparazzi
to take a picture of them.

42:19.840 --> 42:23.640
And then the winner would be
the person who got the most
amount of those pictures

42:23.680 --> 42:25.600
actually published.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.040
RICHARD: I decided that
what I'd do was take my wife

42:32.080 --> 42:35.280
out for dinner at
the glittering
Bluebird restaurant

42:35.320 --> 42:38.000
on the famous King's Road.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.160
It's a popular haunt
for the paps, this.

42:40.200 --> 42:44.760
And I felt sure we'd
be snapped getting out
of the little Ford.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.600
OK, right,
so remember to smile.

42:47.640 --> 42:49.640
And look like
you really like me.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.440
-OK.
-Like, a lot.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.000
Right.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.040
Hold my hand, there.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.160
And then we'll just
stand around for a bit.

43:02.960 --> 43:05.520
-Looking forward to dinner
with my wife Mindy.
-That'll be nice.

43:09.920 --> 43:13.520
Jeremy, meanwhile, had
decided that to get
himself noticed,

43:13.560 --> 43:17.320
he'd have a puncture,
and then get a celebrity

43:17.360 --> 43:19.920
like Binky Felstead
to help him mend it.

43:22.480 --> 43:25.200
-You grab the spare wheel.
-Really?

43:30.120 --> 43:32.280
You have to twiddle it
so the car goes up.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.200
-Really high in the sky.
-For God's sake!

43:34.280 --> 43:35.680
Oh.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.760
Come on,
put your back into it.

43:37.800 --> 43:41.280
I'm exhausted. (GRUNTS)

43:41.320 --> 43:43.160
JEREMY: James, meanwhile,
was driving a car

43:43.200 --> 43:45.160
that's never been papped

43:45.200 --> 43:47.640
through a part of London
that's never been papped,

43:47.680 --> 43:51.000
with his dinner date,
historian Mary Beard...

43:51.040 --> 43:53.240
who hasn't been
papped either.

43:55.640 --> 43:57.560
I'm absolutely delighted.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.600
This has made my month, this.

43:59.640 --> 44:03.320
Well... Well, thank you,
that's very generous.

44:03.360 --> 44:06.600
James then tried to think of
some interesting small talk.

44:14.560 --> 44:17.080
This has this handy piece of
red in the steering wheel,

44:17.120 --> 44:20.000
so you know when you're going
in a straight line, you see.

44:20.040 --> 44:22.880
(TUTS) They've thought
of everything.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.120
JEREMY:
Meanwhile, back in Chelsea...

44:27.520 --> 44:29.520
There's no paps.
There's nobody here.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.480
-No.
-There's no photographers.

44:34.280 --> 44:35.880
It's ridiculous.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.920
I'm always being
photographed here.

44:37.960 --> 44:39.280
Look, here I am.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.320
And here I am.

44:41.360 --> 44:43.120
And here... Oh, she's just...

44:43.160 --> 44:45.080
She's just a friend
from work.

44:46.880 --> 44:48.640
We should try
having an argument.

44:48.680 --> 44:51.800
-I don't want to have
an argument.
-Well, I do, and you don't.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.000
So we're already having
an argument. This is good.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.600
-I don't want an argument.
-Just look a bit animated.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.520
JEREMY:
Having parked his car,

44:59.560 --> 45:02.280
James was now in his
favourite Indian restaurant,

45:02.320 --> 45:06.040
having a lesson
in classical history.

45:06.080 --> 45:10.040
The idea of the bloke
is that he is penetrating.

45:10.080 --> 45:15.160
To be a man
is to be the penetrator.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.920
Every orifice he likes,
sex wherever.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.000
I've got to say, this is not
what I was expecting.

45:21.040 --> 45:24.160
I was thinking you'd give me
some information about
the shape of arches.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.120
Oh, well,
we can go on to that.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.640
(SHE GRUNTS)

45:29.200 --> 45:31.200
So you've got to
get that lined up.

45:31.240 --> 45:33.160
And then put the new ones in.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
What are you doing?
You're not--

45:37.040 --> 45:39.240
-I'm sorry,
it's really greasy.
-I know!

45:39.280 --> 45:43.520
This may have been just
a puncture but it was
proving to be big news.

45:43.560 --> 45:45.080
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

45:47.360 --> 45:49.880
And that is how
you change a wheel.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.840
If you ever have
a puncture on a motorway,

45:51.880 --> 45:54.040
you're going to be
so grateful for this moment.

45:54.080 --> 45:55.280
Lesson learned, Jeremy.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.680
With dinner over,

45:57.720 --> 45:59.960
the two most unpappable
people in history

46:00.000 --> 46:02.800
were waiting to be papped.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.800
If we just stand here
looking a bit sort of...

46:04.840 --> 46:06.840
-Embarrassed?
-Well...

46:06.880 --> 46:08.360
Expectant?

46:08.400 --> 46:09.920
Somebody will come
and take a picture of us.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.200
I've just had a thought.
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way,

46:26.240 --> 46:29.480
but actually the idea of
this was to get the car
in the paper.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.440
I should have
parked it outside.

46:34.440 --> 46:36.360
(BELCHES)
Excuse me.

46:45.520 --> 46:47.720
Wait a minute, there is...
There's one.

46:47.760 --> 46:50.320
Don't point, don't look,
but there's one over there.
There he is.

46:50.360 --> 46:52.360
Pap, there.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.960
JEREMY: However, before
any pictures were taken,

46:55.000 --> 46:58.680
May and I hatched a plan we'd
been working on for years.

46:58.720 --> 47:00.240
Go.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.480
Oh, you bastards!

47:13.080 --> 47:14.960
That was my...

47:15.000 --> 47:16.720
Get in.

47:16.760 --> 47:18.680
(APPLAUSE)

47:24.080 --> 47:26.000
James, did...

47:26.040 --> 47:28.640
Did you burp in front
of Mary Beard?

47:28.680 --> 47:31.080
I did. I'm sorry, it just
fell out. I apologise.

47:31.120 --> 47:34.000
I know a lot of people
will be thinking
we engineered that.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.760
We really genuinely didn't.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.640
All you have to do to get
papped when you're in
our line of work

47:38.680 --> 47:41.520
is go into London,
do something mildly
out of the ordinary

47:41.560 --> 47:43.560
and then they swarm...
not round you.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.800
Or get clattered
and fall out of a club
with no trousers on.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.120
-That's a good way
of doing it.
-Or catch pneumonia.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.760
Yes.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.880
I've had that a few times.
Anyway, while we were waiting

47:53.920 --> 47:57.520
to see which of our antics
got into The Mail Online,

47:57.560 --> 48:01.880
Mr Wilman came up with
another youth-friendly idea.

48:01.920 --> 48:05.280
Yep, he said each of us had
to take a picture of our car

48:05.320 --> 48:09.280
and then see which of us got
the most likes of their snap
on Instagram.

48:12.160 --> 48:13.840
JAMES: Having split up,

48:13.880 --> 48:15.800
we set to work
on our respective plans.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.080
Â£50 is very reasonable, yeah.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.480
Â£50,000?

48:22.520 --> 48:24.520
Oh, right.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.560
Um...
I'll ring you back in a bit.

48:26.600 --> 48:28.520
Yeah, cheers.

48:32.880 --> 48:37.120
My idea was to put me and the
car in one of the pods of the
famous London Eye

48:37.160 --> 48:39.760
so we could have a picture
right at the top
with a fantastic view.

48:39.800 --> 48:43.840
They want Â£50,000!
I thought he meant 50 quid.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.480
Let's think of
something else.

48:46.520 --> 48:49.480
RICHARD:
I had done just that.

48:49.520 --> 48:51.640
For my Instagram picture,
I'm not messing about.

48:51.680 --> 48:55.560
I've recruited a top
photographer and I'm very
excited, cos he's brilliant.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.520
Look at that.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.760
His name is David Yarrow.

49:02.800 --> 49:05.720
He's one of the world's
greatest wildlife
photographers.

49:05.760 --> 49:09.200
And his plan was
to recreate this shot,

49:09.240 --> 49:12.280
using my car
instead of the tiger.

49:13.640 --> 49:15.200
So I'm coming in...

49:15.240 --> 49:17.240
The most important thing
is to have energy.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.280
It's got to be dynamic.

49:19.320 --> 49:23.360
And that means we need
water flying up between me
and the car.

49:23.400 --> 49:27.040
I want to be as close
safety-wise as you'll
allow me to be.

49:28.840 --> 49:31.200
Yeah, yeah.
I've got your number.

49:31.240 --> 49:32.880
-OK.
-(LAUGHS)

49:34.480 --> 49:35.840
JAMES: Back in London,

49:35.880 --> 49:37.880
I'd come up with
a brilliant idea.

49:42.200 --> 49:43.360
Morning.

49:57.320 --> 49:58.480
Morning.

50:02.360 --> 50:04.680
Hiya.
Put some clothes on.

50:06.440 --> 50:09.280
RICHARD: Eventually,
my shot was in the can.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.720
Ach!

50:14.360 --> 50:16.120
As was May's.

50:18.120 --> 50:20.120
And so, after
no work at all,

50:20.160 --> 50:22.080
was Jeremy's.

50:32.280 --> 50:36.960
Could... Could you have made
any less effort with that
challenge?

50:37.000 --> 50:38.880
No, you're right.

50:38.920 --> 50:41.720
I should have put a puppy
in it, cos Instagram
loves a dog.

50:41.760 --> 50:44.920
Anyone on Instagram,
it's all just dogs,
basically.

50:44.960 --> 50:46.960
Anyway, with our pictures
posted on Instagram,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
we were all given
another challenge,

50:49.040 --> 50:52.960
to see who could get
the most views of their car
on YouTube.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.240
Yeah, now,
this is a tricky one.

50:55.280 --> 51:01.080
Because over 300 hours of
footage are uploaded to
YouTube every minute.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.160
You wouldn't think
that many cats

51:03.200 --> 51:05.240
fell into
waste disposal units.

51:05.280 --> 51:07.000
No, I know, you wouldn't.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.040
Seems they do. So we had to
think of something special.

51:09.080 --> 51:13.040
How could we make our cars
shine in this crowded
firmament?

51:13.080 --> 51:14.720
Push them into
a waste disposal unit?

51:14.760 --> 51:16.280
I think that's got to be it.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.080
Or what I did
to get my Ford noticed,

51:19.120 --> 51:21.600
I decided to stage
a big stunt.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.760
In order to make
my first stunt video,

51:25.800 --> 51:29.760
I went to a very long runway.

51:29.800 --> 51:32.920
And once my star performer
had warmed up...

51:34.520 --> 51:36.240
...we were ready to roll.

51:39.960 --> 51:41.840
Today history is being made.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.120
Good luck.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.920
Oh.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.240
I can't watch.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.720
Yes! (LAUGHS)

52:10.760 --> 52:15.320

the internet with that!

52:15.360 --> 52:19.680
Meanwhile, James had gone for
a rather different approach.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.360
If you go on YouTube,
which I do quite a lot,

52:22.400 --> 52:25.040
you will notice that
something that's very popular
with so-called millennials

52:25.080 --> 52:27.080
is the unboxing video.

52:27.120 --> 52:30.880
It's usually something
like an idle student
with nothing better to do

52:30.920 --> 52:33.200
simply taking something
they've bought out of the box

52:33.240 --> 52:34.880
and talking about it.

52:34.920 --> 52:37.880
Hey, what's going on?
The delivery guy's just left.

52:37.920 --> 52:41.000
Got it here and I haven't
even taken it out
of the box yet. I got--

52:41.040 --> 52:44.960
This bloke is unboxing a new
television set he's bought.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000

52:47.040 --> 52:48.960

is not mounted on it,

52:55.320 --> 52:56.880

that on later.

Hi, guys, it's May!

53:03.640 --> 53:06.560
Welcome, brothers and sisters
to my latest unboxing video.

It's a car.

Look how clean that is.

Jeremy had decided

53:25.600 --> 53:28.000
to create a Fast Show -style

"pap in a bag", didn't you?

should sell those bags
to celebrities.

rather clever.

in that picture.

that is The Sun.

a zero, Hammond.

57:58.920 --> 58:01.080
-Not that well, actually.
RICHARD: How not that well?

58:01.120 --> 58:04.520
-Nought, not that well.
-Not a single thing?

58:04.560 --> 58:06.640
-My plan was rather
successful.
-Was it?

58:06.680 --> 58:11.640
49 pictures appeared,
of my car and me and Binky
in The Mail Online.

58:11.680 --> 58:13.680
-49?
-49 pictures.

58:13.720 --> 58:17.120
Hang on a minute. 49 pictures
of a fat old bloke

58:17.160 --> 58:19.560
and a young girl I've never
heard of changing a wheel?

58:19.600 --> 58:21.600
I know. And the
extraordinary thing is,

58:21.640 --> 58:23.640
I'd like to show you
the 49 pictures

58:23.680 --> 58:27.080
but I got in touch with The
Mail Online yesterday, OK,

58:27.120 --> 58:28.720
to say, "Can we have
the pictures?"

58:28.760 --> 58:31.280
Do you want to know how much
they were gonna charge?

58:31.320 --> 58:34.160
Â£122,000.

58:34.200 --> 58:35.760
-What?
-Really?

58:35.800 --> 58:38.920
I kid you not. They take a
picture of me, ruin my life,

58:38.960 --> 58:42.000
and then for me
to buy the picture back

58:42.040 --> 58:45.600
is Â£122,000!

58:45.640 --> 58:48.000
There are 49 pictures
on here of you.

58:48.040 --> 58:51.440
Don't show the cameras,
otherwise there'll be a bill
for 120 grand.

58:51.480 --> 58:54.480
-But the good thing is...
-Exactly. Because of that,
you score 49.

58:54.520 --> 58:56.600
Yes, I'm afraid he does.
There's no getting around
that.

58:56.640 --> 58:59.600
Yes, I do. Which moves us
on to Instagram.

58:59.640 --> 59:02.520
James May, how did you do
with your picture on the bus?

59:02.560 --> 59:03.960
I scored nought.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.720
-Nought?
-Yeah.

59:05.760 --> 59:08.040
-How did you get nought?
-Well, it's quite
interesting.

59:08.080 --> 59:11.040
I didn't have an Instagram
account so I set one up.

59:11.080 --> 59:13.400
-There's a surprise.
-No, but I set one up.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.120
And then as I was
setting it up,
I realised

59:15.160 --> 59:18.080
there was someone else on
Instagram pretending to be me.

59:18.120 --> 59:21.720
So I filled in that reporting
thing that pulls down
and I sent it off.

59:21.760 --> 59:25.480
All credit to Instagram, they
reacted very quickly - by
that afternoon, in fact.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.120
And they shut me down.

59:27.160 --> 59:28.640
-(LAUGHTER)
-You?

59:28.680 --> 59:30.840
Yeah, they didn't shut down
the fake James May.

59:30.880 --> 59:32.560
They shut the real one down.

59:32.600 --> 59:34.600
-They killed the wrong
James May?
-Yeah.

59:34.640 --> 59:36.520
That's quite interesting.
What's interesting me,
though,

59:36.560 --> 59:39.480
is that there's a man
somewhere out in the world,
or woman,

59:39.520 --> 59:42.440
who's thought, "I could
pretend to be anyone I like.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.480
I shall pretend to be
James May."

59:44.520 --> 59:46.200
-I know.
RICHARD: Not very ambitious!

59:46.240 --> 59:48.040
Why wouldn't you be
George Clooney?

59:48.080 --> 59:50.520
Anyway, the net result
of that, as they say
in the army,

59:50.560 --> 59:52.600
is that I have...nought.

59:52.640 --> 59:55.560
-You're doing very well!
-I've got one, yeah.

59:55.600 --> 59:57.960
So, Hammond,
how did you get on?

59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.160
Well, my picture
was brilliant. Look at it.

1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:03.200
Look at that!

1:00:03.240 --> 1:00:06.240
JEREMY: No, apart from
the slogan with the sexual
intercourse enthusiast,

1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:08.280
that is an amazing
photograph, granted.

1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:12.240
So how many people have
viewed it and liked it
on Instagram?

1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:14.600
Nine.

1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:15.920
(LAUGHTER)

1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:17.960
-They blocked you as well?
-Nine. No.

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.040
I don't really do Instagram,
so I don't have many
followers.

1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:23.080
So only nine people
have seen it.

1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:25.680
Oh, dear, cos I got 54,000.

1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:27.680
Oh, for God's sake!

1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:29.640
Yes, but you do do Instagram!

1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:31.560
-Yes, I do.
-So you got lots of
followers.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:33.200
Put in 54,000.

1:00:33.240 --> 1:00:35.320
Let's look at this in a more
positive light, Hammond.

1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:39.240
-He has got 1.6 million
Instagram followers.
-Yes.

1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:42.880
So 1.46 million people
actively didn't like his
picture.

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:44.560
-That's another way
of looking at it.
-Loser!

1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:47.320
It wasn't my best work, I
admit. It was a hurried shot.

1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:49.080
-What was it?
-54,000.

1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:51.840
RICHARD: That does
change the score line a bit.

1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:55.520
It changes the score line a
lot, cos I'm now on 54,053.

1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:58.560
-Right, OK.
-And you're on one.

1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:01.400
Anyway, I also...
It gets worse, I'm afraid,
for you two.

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:04.640
Because YouTube.
I didn't add them all up,

1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:08.120
but my first David SoufflÃ©
video on YouTube...

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:13.000
-266,000 views.
RICHARD: Oh, God.

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:15.480
More than a quarter
of a million people.

1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:23.520
You are ahead now.

1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:27.480
Yes, I'm...comfortably
in the lead, I would say.

1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:29.520
So, come on, Hammond?

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.560
16,800.

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:33.200
What, for all that effort?

1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:35.240
I know!
I don't get it either.

1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:37.440
Because I gave it a really
cool, tempting caption.

1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:38.760
It said...

1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:40.720
(HE READS)

1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:47.160
Who doesn't want
to look at that?

1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:48.560
You actually put that
as the caption?

1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:49.840
That's what it said,
it's clickbait.

1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:51.560
Then the YouTube
millennials thought,

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.120
"No, I'd rather watch
a cat going..."?

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:54.400
-They must have done.
-That's ridiculous.

1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:55.960
I'm sorry, that is pathetic.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.600
Young people,
you're pathetic.

1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:00.800
Right, so, there we are,
those are the scores.

1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:02.680
-You're out.
-Yes.

1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:04.720
And, James,
I'm looking and I'm thinking,

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:06.760
just doing quick adding up...

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:09.360
Unless you manage to find

1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:12.200
325,000 people

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:15.080
who are prepared
to spend 16 minutes...

1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:17.600
Cos that's how long
that unboxing video was.

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:21.880
...16 minutes watching you
taking a small
Toyota hatchback

1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:24.440
out of a cardboard box,
I've won.

1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:25.560
-Yes.
-So?

1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:28.560
(SIGHS) 330...

1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:33.080
...thousand!

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.240
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:38.320
(WHOOPING)

1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:44.280
For taking a car
out of a box?

1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:46.320
Oh, he's doing the dance.

1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:49.080
How does he always
manage to win?

1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:51.760
I think on this occasion
it was partly because

1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:55.680
you tried to appeal to
millennials by creating a
Fast Show type character

1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:58.480
when nobody under 40 has ever
heard of The Fast Show.

1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:02.040
Right. You might as well have
done the comedy adventures of
Neville Chamberlain in 1939.

1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:03.640
That would have been better.

1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:07.000
So because there are more
people who'd rather watch

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:09.320
an old man take
a small car out of a box,

1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:14.280
than watch him endangering
an office junior or me
wearing a moustache,

1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:19.200
we have to deduce that
the best of the small
hot hatchbacks

1:03:19.240 --> 1:03:21.240
is comfortably the worst.

1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:23.320
Yeah, that is our conclusion.

1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:25.320
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it's time to end.

1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:27.560
Thank you so much for
watching, see you next time.
Goodbye!
