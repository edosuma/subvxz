WEBVTT

01:04.565 --> 01:05.645
Nadine?

01:05.732 --> 01:08.314
Did the monster go away?

02:52.798 --> 02:54.629
Kyle.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.124
What are you doing here?

02:58.303 --> 03:00.544
I couldn't sleep, so I took a walk.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.254
And I heard the music and...

03:02.349 --> 03:04.089
What's wrong?

03:05.811 --> 03:07.017
- I saw her.
- Who?

03:07.104 --> 03:09.095
My little sister.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.768
Here, sit.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.728
Take a deep breath.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.741
Now another one.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.707
It was a dream. It was a bad one.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.253
It didn't make any sense.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.709
There was an aiguillette on the
door and then Nadine came in.

03:35.757 --> 03:39.124
She was just standing
there, and she'd been shot.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.256
- There was so much blood.
- Listen, it was a nightmare.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.764
Ijust can't stop thinking about it.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.770
I was in the room with her. I
mean, I must have seen it happen.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.814
God, why didn't I protect
her? Why didn't I do something?

03:54.901 --> 03:58.439
Listen, Kyle, Kyle,
maybe you did protect her.

03:58.572 --> 04:02.485
Listen to me. Listen. Here. Listen.

04:04.578 --> 04:08.742
Listen, nobody really knows
what happened that night.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.873
And thinking about it is
just gonna make you crazy.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.042
It's coming back to me.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.211
And I don't want it to.
I don't want to remember.

04:16.298 --> 04:20.211
Well, you know, memories may
come back. They may haunt you.

04:20.302 --> 04:25.137
But you just have to find
a way to live with them.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.845
I don't know ifI can.

04:31.521 --> 04:35.810
Well, it's like, um... It's like combat.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.102
You make split-second decisions,

04:40.197 --> 04:42.984
and then you second-guess yourself
more than anybody else does.

04:43.074 --> 04:47.659
But there is just no going back.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.372
Is that what happened to you?

04:53.418 --> 04:54.954
I mean, is that why you're here?

04:57.798 --> 05:01.211
You know, Kyle, you don't have to say
everything that pops into your head.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.133
I'm sorry.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.255
It was war.

05:09.351 --> 05:13.720
And there is nothing in the human
experience that can compare to it.

05:13.814 --> 05:17.523
But you can't have regrets.
You have to move on.

05:17.609 --> 05:18.769
Or die.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.323
I know that song you
were dancing to earlier.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.075
We had to dance to it at cotillion.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.330
You know how to dance?

05:40.131 --> 05:42.417
Just the box step.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.758
If you can box step, you can waltz.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.640
No, I can't. I'm not very good.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.938
Neither am I.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.481
Start with this
foot. Okay, it comes this way.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.567
And that moves back.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.912
Right.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.362
Lincoln's arrest records
says the gun he brought to school

06:48.491 --> 06:50.231
was a silver-plated Glock.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.034
Same weapon used on the Stansburys.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.664
You got cigarettes?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.791
I quit. I told you.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.547
You get any sleep last night?
Because you look like shit.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.174
Whatever.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.389
And you stink too.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.137
What were you doing?

07:17.228 --> 07:20.265
Don't worry about it, all
right? I had a few beers.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.979
Yeah?

07:22.651 --> 07:23.982
Yeah.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.853
So you're good, then?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.821
Yeah, I'll be good if you get
off my fucking back about it.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.578
Look, I'm okay, all
right? Just give it a rest.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.418
There he is.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.304
What up, Lincoln?

08:00.313 --> 08:03.976
Well, if it isn't 21 Jump Street.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.890
I'm not supposed to talk to you, po-po.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.979
I didn't think you were the
order-taking type, Private Fuckface.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.987
I'm not.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.524
Holding back on me, son.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.698
You didn't tell me about you and Mrs. S.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.405
What about her?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.032
She was my tennis coach.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.575
Is that what you call it?

08:26.297 --> 08:29.130
You play tennis, ma'am? Ah.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.257
Probably not.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.086
I mean, what do you make
being a cop, 50, 60 a year?

08:34.180 --> 08:35.886
What's your point?

08:37.058 --> 08:39.049
Tennis skirts.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.597
Why wear something that
barely covers your snatch

08:41.688 --> 08:43.349
unless you're looking to get staked?

08:45.275 --> 08:47.766
Was Mrs. Stansbury your first?

08:48.153 --> 08:50.565
He doesn't have to answer
that. It's all over his face.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.065
Hey, man, you don't know shit.

08:55.285 --> 08:59.324
Maybe it was a big deal to you,
not to her. Maybe that hurt.

08:59.414 --> 09:02.622
Maybe you just didn't measure
up, if you know what I'm saying.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.119
Maybe she was laughing at your virgin ass
because you were too quick on the draw.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.335
That bitch didn't laugh at me.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.718
She knew what she was doing.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.094
When she'd strut into that locker room

09:20.602 --> 09:23.935
and bend over in that little
fucking skirt of hers...

09:25.982 --> 09:27.392
They can smell it.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.730
Like a sixth sense, you know?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.106
Knowing that you're gonna look.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.315
Because you gotta look, right?

09:40.705 --> 09:42.821
And that's when they get you.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.832
But not if you get them first.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.411
Hey, where's the gun?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.627
What gun?

09:54.427 --> 09:57.089
The silver Glock
you brought to school.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.135
All right, 40-watt. I got more than one.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.092
Go check my bedroom at home if you want.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.057
Tell my mom "What's
up," while you're at it.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.019
What you gonna do with
all those guns, Lincoln?

10:10.985 --> 10:12.771
Well, I hunt.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.487
You know, one time I killed this possum.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.656
Blew its head clean off, right?

10:18.743 --> 10:24.830
Tongue, teeth, all sorts of stringy,
bloody gunk sprayed everywhere.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.124
And, man, it was fucking dope.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.000
You know what happens
when you go to prison?

10:37.095 --> 10:40.178
When a con and his crew
gang-rapes a motherfucker like you,

10:40.223 --> 10:43.511
all sorts of stringy, bloody gunk
comes out of your fucking ass.

10:43.601 --> 10:44.807
Holder.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.973
Forty-watt.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.018
Punk-ass motherfucker.

10:51.109 --> 10:55.978
The fuck is your fucking
problem, fucking prick?

11:10.211 --> 11:12.122
Yo, Detective.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.712
What the hell do you want?

11:18.803 --> 11:21.670
Here to get me my scrilla for some jib jab.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.504
I need a powwow in private.

11:23.725 --> 11:27.058
You need to learn the
English language, fuckhead.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.885
It's about a murder.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.766
Yeah? What murder?

11:31.232 --> 11:32.972
Something to do with a car, I don't know.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.023
But the guy confessed.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.569
Come here, we gotta talk on the
DL. I don't want no one hearing.

11:38.656 --> 11:42.490
You don't know shit about any murder,
you lying bastard. Go hit the pipe.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.992
Was a cop who did it.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.790
A detective.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.008
- Kyle, come on, I need you.
- What for?

12:01.346 --> 12:03.132
Let's go. Now.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.476
Ten-hut!

12:13.316 --> 12:15.602
- Fish.
- Yes, sir!

12:15.693 --> 12:17.900
What you are about to embark
on is a proud tradition

12:17.987 --> 12:20.694
that occurs each year for all new cadets

12:20.782 --> 12:23.569
called "Slaphappy Sing-Along Day."

12:23.660 --> 12:25.616
Have you been briefed about how this works?

12:25.703 --> 12:26.954
Yes, sir!

12:27.038 --> 12:28.699
Excellent.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.411
Then all we need is a nursery rhyme.

12:33.127 --> 12:37.211
Cadet Stansbury, the honor is yours.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.423
I thought Colonel Rayne
said no more hazing.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.259
Fuck her.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.381
Now, I need a rhyme, cadet.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.597
Um, "The Itsy-Bitsy Spider."

12:52.480 --> 12:54.471
The tiny one!

12:54.565 --> 12:56.396
Tremendous choice.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.897
Fish to my right, you get first crack.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.024
One step forward.

13:04.993 --> 13:08.076
A-flight, commence.

13:08.162 --> 13:12.075
The itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout

13:13.251 --> 13:16.539
Down came the rain And
washed the spider out

13:18.256 --> 13:21.419
Out came the sun And
dried up all the rain

13:22.760 --> 13:26.127
And the itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the spout again

13:28.808 --> 13:32.050
The itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout

13:33.021 --> 13:36.354
Down came the rain
And washed the spider out

13:37.775 --> 13:41.359
Sir, can I go, sir? I
have a paper to write.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.862
Permission denied, cadet.

13:45.533 --> 13:49.367
We need to toughen up these boys,
fortify them against the enemy.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.986
Think of it as POW training camp.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.539
We're not at war, AJ. We're
not even real soldiers.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.959
We're just rich kids in a boarding school.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.709
Out came the sun
That dried up all the rain

14:02.842 --> 14:05.549
I can see we need to get you back on track.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.345
Fish, halt.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.591
It's your lucky day, Fish.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.472
You're in for a treat.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.267
Private Stansbury and
myself are gonna demonstrate

14:19.359 --> 14:21.395
how this ritual is really done.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.276
Hit me, cadet.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.616
- Hit me.
- No.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.113
You're defying chain of
command. Now, do it, hit me.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.865
No.

14:33.748 --> 14:36.364
- Knopf.
- Yes, sir.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.293
Pair off with Stansbury.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.417
Commence.

14:49.764 --> 14:54.303
Itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout

14:57.271 --> 14:58.977
It's your turn, cadet.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.021
No.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.985
I can't let you hit him, Cadet
Stansbury, unless you sing.

15:13.579 --> 15:18.619
Down came the rain That
washed the spider out

15:23.172 --> 15:27.541
Out came the sun That
dried up all the rain

15:30.430 --> 15:35.220
The itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the spout again

15:41.315 --> 15:45.024
Itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout

15:48.781 --> 15:53.445
Down came the rain That
washed the spider out

15:54.287 --> 15:58.997
Out came the sun That
dried up all the rain

16:02.753 --> 16:07.042
Itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the spout again

16:10.094 --> 16:11.504
Itsy-bitsy spider...

16:11.596 --> 16:13.257
That's enough.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.394
Hit me, cadet.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.527
Dismissed.

16:45.588 --> 16:50.002
What the fuck? You let your
kid hang this shit on his walls?

16:50.092 --> 16:53.676
Lincoln's therapist said it's a
phase. We need to let it play out.

16:53.763 --> 16:58.132
Play out? It's not like he's drawing
pubic hair on some Victoria's Secret model.

16:58.226 --> 17:02.014
How's hacking the faces off
centerfolds letting him play it out?

17:02.855 --> 17:06.598
Mrs. Knopf, do you think this has
to do with what happened to your son

17:06.692 --> 17:09.934
- with his tennis coach?
- This? No.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.862
He's done this stuff for
years. He thinks it's funny.

17:12.949 --> 17:17.363
And frankly, I think the school
overreacted to all this nonsense.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.569
Really. How so?

17:19.956 --> 17:23.289
My son's had troubles, plenty of them.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.116
But not this kind.

17:25.211 --> 17:29.580
And even if it were true about
Lincoln and Linda Stansbury,

17:29.674 --> 17:31.790
Lincoln's certainly old
enough. He's not a child.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.796
Your kid's a piece of shit, no
doubt, but he was 16 years old.

17:35.012 --> 17:38.004
My son is not
a piece of shit, Detective.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.261
And I'll say it again,
the school overreacted.

17:41.519 --> 17:44.261
Did the school overreact when they
found that gun in Lincoln's backpack?

17:44.355 --> 17:46.767
Of course not. He shouldn't have done that.

17:46.857 --> 17:51.226
It was a stupid, ill-conceived stunt.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.776
It's not as though he shot anyone.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.947
So if it wasn't a big deal,
then why'd you send him away?

17:56.033 --> 17:59.025
Huh? No wonder he's so fucked up.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.996
He needs to stop talking
to me like that right now.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.124
We're gonna need to search
the room, Mrs. Knopf.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.872
Can you step out?

18:10.423 --> 18:13.415
We have nothing to hide.
Do whatever you need to.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.553
Lincoln's been very hard to handle.

18:20.516 --> 18:24.225
But we're not the only parents who
have needed to send their child away.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.512
It doesn't mean we don't love him.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.815
And it sure as hell doesn't
mean we've raised a killer.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.781
These are not street people, Holder.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.702
They file complaints, and you damn well
know it. What's the matter with you?

18:58.679 --> 19:02.137
- That was a fucking waste of time.
- Little shit.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.886
He wanted me to see his S and
M collection. He set us up.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.684
There was never any gun in
his bedroom and he knew it.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.723
So, what now? We get a
warrant, search his barracks?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.687
What's wrong with your legs?

19:17.740 --> 19:20.527
What? I got restless leg
syndrome. You never get that?

19:22.620 --> 19:24.827
No. Never.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.667
I mean, Lincoln could've run
out the night of the murders.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.672
He needed wheels.

19:33.714 --> 19:37.798
It's like an hour's drive back and forth
to the Stansburys' from St. George's.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.216
No buses run that time of night.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.760
Maybe he drove that Corolla
that we saw in the Emmett photos.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.384
There's no Corolla registered to
Lincoln or anyone in his family.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.803
Plus, we got squat on it.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.681
Partial plate, don't even got the color.

19:49.730 --> 19:53.143
Maybe he borrowed it or hitchhiked.

19:54.610 --> 19:58.068
The killer shot them at point-blank
range. He'd be covered in blood.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.193
You're not hitchhiking or driving the hour
back to St. George's looking like that.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.284
He had to clean up somewhere.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.245
We should check all the gas stations

20:08.332 --> 20:10.709
between the Stansbury
house and the academy.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.709
That's gotta be like 50 gas stations.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.746
Get the unis to canvass. I'm not
jumping on some wild-goose chase.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.549
Hey.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.880
Let me out. I gotta do something.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.218
- Did you use?
- What?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.564
Don't bullshit me, Holder.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.934
You've been acting like an
out-of-control asshole all day long.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.890
And I'm asking you if you're using again.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.318
What the fuck, Linden?

20:39.405 --> 20:41.066
Let me out. Pull over.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.567
Why, so you can score?

20:42.783 --> 20:45.024
Pull the fuck over!

20:51.208 --> 20:54.200
Hey, isn't your kid in town? Why
don't you go spend some time with him?

20:54.295 --> 20:56.536
- Be a good mom for a change.
- Oh, right, I forgot.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.793
Now that Caroline's two seconds
pregnant, you're the expert on parenting.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.090
Yeah, I learned from the best.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.328
Son of a bitch.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.834
Son of a bitch.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.294
- Hey, Chadwick.
- Yeah?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.766
What was it Linden had you pull for her

21:49.850 --> 21:52.557
the night we were searching
for that missing kid, Adrian?

21:52.645 --> 21:56.058
Photos of some car. It was a dark gray
sedan, I think, outside Adrian's school.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.059
It was following the kid around.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.436
Dark gray, huh? Who'd it belong to?

22:00.694 --> 22:02.730
Don't know. Sarah told me to drop it.

22:02.822 --> 22:03.982
Did she, now?

22:04.949 --> 22:06.814
Get me a copy of those photos, would you?

22:06.867 --> 22:08.573
Sure thing.

23:29.283 --> 23:32.775
You're telling me there's no way that
gun could possibly be on academy grounds?

23:32.870 --> 23:37.830
Mm-hm. All boys are checked whenever
they come on to campus for drugs, guns.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.953
We practically strip-search them.

23:40.002 --> 23:42.038
This isn't Club Med.

23:42.129 --> 23:45.963
Lincoln Knopf's a damaged boy,
but it's more bark than bite.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.962
As is the case with most of my boys.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.549
Since coming here, has he ever been violent

23:56.644 --> 23:59.351
or acted out in any way you'd
consider beyond the norm?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.724
No. Not at all.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.477
You should have told me you talked to him.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.308
Lincoln wasn't on academy grounds.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.564
Hmm. So you ambushed him?

24:08.656 --> 24:10.988
No. We asked him a few questions.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.990
We're conducting a murder
investigation, Colonel.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.277
- I thought you wanted to help.
- I do.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.284
Which is why I'm tolerating this
extreme invasion of my school

24:19.375 --> 24:21.115
and the lives of these young men.

24:21.919 --> 24:25.036
But I have my limits, Detective Linden.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.001
Why do you protect them?

24:30.344 --> 24:33.006
Because it's my job.

24:33.097 --> 24:37.386
We are a nation of laws.
Everyone deserves an advocate.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.686
I need to see Lincoln's room.

24:43.273 --> 24:45.184
Are you gonna make me
get a warrant for that?

24:45.985 --> 24:49.898
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.040
So we get out of the movie

25:12.094 --> 25:15.177
and I'm, like, walking her home,

25:15.264 --> 25:18.131
and I get to her door,

25:18.225 --> 25:21.308
and I know this is it.

25:21.562 --> 25:26.932
So in this voice I've never
heard quite come out of me before,

25:27.026 --> 25:30.143
I very casually asked ifI could kiss her.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.361
Way to go, dude.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.570
So, what happened?

25:35.909 --> 25:37.649
She said yeah

25:37.745 --> 25:39.701
- and I did.
- Ha, ha.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.120
We've been going out for six months now.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.163
Oh!

25:44.251 --> 25:46.583
Well, call me the second that
search warrant comes through.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.956
I don't understand what the problem is.

25:49.590 --> 25:50.705
Hi.

25:50.924 --> 25:54.212
Little booger has a girlfriend.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.085
Oh? I didn't know.

25:56.138 --> 25:59.130
It's not a big deal, Mom.
We're in the same math class.

25:59.975 --> 26:00.964
What's her name?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.550
Mia.

26:02.644 --> 26:05.226
And she has long blond hair

26:05.314 --> 26:06.599
and she's a twin.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.897
And she wants to be an astronaut.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.145
That's great, Jack.
She sounds really great.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.776
Your son's a real heartbreaker.

26:13.864 --> 26:14.899
And the best kind.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.193
Because he doesn't even know it.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.240
- You want something to drink?
- No, thanks.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.410
I thought we were going to have dinner.

26:21.538 --> 26:24.371
Well, we didn't know what time
you'd be here, and Regi made chili

26:24.416 --> 26:26.998
- so Ijust thought...
- I said I was gonna be here at 6.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.828
Well, you're welcome to join us.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.546
Maybe we should stay, Mom.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.422
Or whatever. I mean, we could go too.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.173
I'm sorry. Just give me a second.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.515
Linden. Yes, I meant it.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.392
- Every gas station between Stansbury's
- Here it is.

26:49.650 --> 26:52.107
- and St. George's.
- Monty Python.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.984
I don't give a shit. Pure
more unis on it, then.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.700
It's hilarious.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.993
Let's watch that after we eat.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.070
That sounds cool.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.289
I mean,

27:08.377 --> 27:12.040
- that'd be cool, but we gotta go.
- No, I don't wanna break up the party.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.089
So go ahead. Stay here if you want.
I'll just pick you up at eight.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.712
Or you can spend the night
if you want. Just let me know.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.714
- Don't be that...
- Don't tell me how to be.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.887
- Mom, calm down.
- Please, stay out of it, Jack.

27:22.182 --> 27:25.640
I told you that I was picking
him up for dinner at six.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.809
Well, he was hungry.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.182
And it's not like you're
always on time, Sarah.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.183
What would you know about being on
time? You don't work. You live in a boat.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.519
You never have to be
anywhere. Sorry, I have a job.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.400
- Let's all just take a big breath...
- Shut up, Ellen.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.818
Hey.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.945
What is going on?

27:43.412 --> 27:45.744
You're not my social worker
anymore. Stay out of my life.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.867
Get your backpack, please, Jack.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.910
You don't have the slightest
idea what I'm dealing with.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.963
Every time I've ever opened the door,
the only thing I've gotten back from you

27:56.049 --> 27:58.631
is that disappointed, shitty look of yours.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.467
You don't know me. You have never known me.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.840
That's the problem.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.596
No one does.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.241
This is the
courtyard that bin Laden,

28:28.332 --> 28:30.573
aka. The Pacer, would walk in

28:30.667 --> 28:33.204
and where Chalk One went down,

28:33.253 --> 28:37.041
grazing the compound walls
and rolling on its side

28:37.132 --> 28:39.339
here, causing delays.

28:40.427 --> 28:46.047
But still giving the first team
direct access to the front door, here.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.723
Open your manuals to Page 354.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.768
We will be reviewing the
tactical entry points they used

28:51.855 --> 28:54.267
for what was essentially a home invasion.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.932
Next, they breached the
walls with explosives

28:57.027 --> 28:59.643
allowing access to the
inside of the compound.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.777
Once through, the team converged on the
first floor of the main building here.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.279
Securing the ground floor and the second,

29:06.536 --> 29:10.199
the team continued up these
stairs to the third floor.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.207
This is where they
expected to find bin Laden

29:13.377 --> 29:15.242
in a fortified bedroom, here.

29:15.295 --> 29:18.537
Midway up the stairs, they
encountered bin Laden's son,

29:18.632 --> 29:20.372
who was identified as hostile...

29:25.305 --> 29:26.886
Khalid's dead on the landing.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.222
They stepped past him,

29:29.309 --> 29:32.927
and entered into the bedroom
through this door here.

29:34.314 --> 29:38.899
Then fired several close-range
rounds, killing bin Laden,

29:38.986 --> 29:41.318
who was here.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.690
Cadet Stansbury.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.027
Does this bore you?

29:50.956 --> 29:53.538
Down on your face, and give me 20.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.089
What are you
doing, cadet? I said push-ups.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.382
Where the hell are my push-ups?

30:41.423 --> 30:43.084
Any word on that warrant?

30:44.134 --> 30:47.092
Weak probable cause.
The judge won't grant it.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.765
Lincoln would be an idiot to
keep that gun at the academy.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.809
It's probably somewhere
in the Puget Sound by now.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.772
So, what's on today's itinerary?

31:04.988 --> 31:08.401
Unis have been hitting gas stations
all night, coming up with zip.

31:08.492 --> 31:11.029
I'm getting a lot of pushback, so...

31:12.037 --> 31:13.573
All right.

31:13.663 --> 31:16.405
Ain't nothing like a pleasant
drive in the countryside

31:16.541 --> 31:20.033
looking at some stanking-ass toilets.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.251
Let's go.

31:29.096 --> 31:31.929
I was fucked up yesterday.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.590
Um...

31:36.603 --> 31:38.184
My bad.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.606
Is that an apology?

31:43.652 --> 31:44.687
Yeah.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.862
I said it, didn't I?

31:54.663 --> 31:56.449
I'm sorry.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.663
Do we need to talk about anything else?

32:05.298 --> 32:08.381
Ijust want my kid's sins to be his own.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.793
Yeah, I know.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.634
How do you do it?

32:20.480 --> 32:21.856
How do you not fuck them up?

32:27.821 --> 32:29.357
Yeah.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.819
Just do your best.

32:39.749 --> 32:42.616
What if someone's best ain't shit?

32:43.420 --> 32:45.126
You're here.

32:45.589 --> 32:47.625
That's what matters.

32:48.049 --> 32:51.177
It's kind of the only thing that matters,

32:51.428 --> 32:53.384
that you show up.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.931
You'll be all right.

33:03.106 --> 33:06.974
Everybody thinks I'm a
piece of shit tweak-head.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.607
You seem to think I'm something better.

33:18.163 --> 33:21.747
Yeah. You're a
1-900-Rock-Star.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.208
Aw.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.770
We're living the dream.

33:47.734 --> 33:52.023
So where'd you go after I
dropped you off yesterday?

33:53.198 --> 33:54.688
Church.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.148
Church?

33:56.201 --> 33:58.112
I thought you were a Buddhist.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.068
Same thing.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.994
Thirty-one flavors, all made out of milk.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.869
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.576
That's because I'm a
mystery wrapped in a conundrum.

34:07.671 --> 34:11.414
Ha, ha. So out of nowhere, you just

34:11.550 --> 34:14.383
find some church and go in?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.761
It's not just some church.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.175
Monastery of Our Lady of Peace.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.226
I used to go there when I first got clean.

34:25.689 --> 34:27.429
Sit there.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.686
They've got these nuns
who sing behind a wall.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.610
They don't ever come out
for the rest of their lives.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.441
You never see them.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.066
They're just cloistered
up in there forever.

34:40.328 --> 34:43.070
I'd go there to quiet my mind.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.117
Fill it with those nuns' voices.

34:49.671 --> 34:51.332
That sounds really beautiful, actually.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.039
It was.

34:54.384 --> 34:57.922
I mean, whatever, it used to
be. Yesterday it was just noise.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.217
What about you?

35:01.308 --> 35:03.048
What about me what?

35:03.143 --> 35:04.849
The great light show.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.438
You were Catholic for a minute.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.762
You still believe?

35:08.857 --> 35:11.564
What, God and angels and manna from heaven?

35:12.193 --> 35:13.729
Uh-uh.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.311
But hell?

35:17.532 --> 35:18.897
We're in it.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.778
Only 49 more bathrooms to go.

35:26.082 --> 35:29.791
All I can tell you is that he and his
partner had a thing a few years back.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.618
It started up again not long ago.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.413
But he's a fucking liar,
so it's hard to be exact.

35:34.591 --> 35:37.799
Yeah. Why don't we talk in here?

35:38.011 --> 35:40.878
It'll be more private.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.257
Here. Have a seat.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.444
- Were there other affairs?
- What do you think?

35:59.949 --> 36:03.237
Let's just say that he's been gone
most nights for a very long time now.

36:05.288 --> 36:08.155
What am I doing here,
Carl? What is this about?

36:08.667 --> 36:12.910
Just a few more questions. Then
I'll be out of your hair. Uh...

36:14.005 --> 36:16.382
When you last saw him, Jen,

36:17.842 --> 36:19.833
he was driving his own car, right?

36:20.053 --> 36:22.590
- Dark gray sedan?
- Yes.

36:25.433 --> 36:28.345
Does James have an eye for younger women?

36:29.396 --> 36:32.433
Heh, what men don't?

36:34.901 --> 36:36.437
Okay.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.824
I don't know how to put this.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.868
Sensitive area.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.744
What about girls?

36:56.965 --> 36:58.921
Young girls.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.931
You know,

37:09.018 --> 37:11.304
I think we're done now.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.265
Okay.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.230
All right, look, I'm sorry, Jen. Uh...

37:20.363 --> 37:23.025
Listen, I know this is... I know
it's been a difficult time for you.

37:23.116 --> 37:25.698
If you're so interested
in finding out where he is

37:25.785 --> 37:28.652
why don't you try following
around that ex-partner of his?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.536
That Linden.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.409
I don't believe for a moment

37:32.584 --> 37:34.324
- that James is in Wyoming.
- No?

37:34.419 --> 37:36.705
They're probably shacking
up out at the lake.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.878
Lake Sawyer? What makes you say that?

37:38.965 --> 37:42.958
Well, I was there the other day
looking for him, and I saw her.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.509
Whoa, whoa.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.297
You saw her there?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.591
She was looking at the water

37:51.686 --> 37:54.553
and she tossed something into the lake.

38:08.036 --> 38:11.403
Oh for nine, Linden, plus
all the ones the unis checked.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.874
Maybe we should just focus on the Corolla,

38:16.961 --> 38:19.873
canvass the Stansburys'
neighborhood again for it.

38:21.341 --> 38:24.583
Oh. Come on, Linden, not Smelly Boy.

38:25.011 --> 38:29.596
There's no telling what kind of microbes
and shit's coming out of his stank ass.

38:29.724 --> 38:30.713
Where'd you get that?

38:31.559 --> 38:32.548
I won it.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.426
Fair and square.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.188
What, the Dumpster?

38:39.526 --> 38:41.733
Did you find it in that Dumpster?

38:41.903 --> 38:43.643
Did you see who threw it in there?

38:43.738 --> 38:45.353
Nope. Too dark.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.693
Was there any clothing with it?

38:47.784 --> 38:49.945
- I don't like the dark.
- Okay.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.742
Calm down.

38:53.373 --> 38:56.581
- I need to take that.
- Oh, cruds.

39:05.301 --> 39:06.802
Thanks.

39:11.558 --> 39:12.547
St. George.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.633
Yep. Let's get
the lab guys out here.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.718
Need to take apart the
sink, pull the drains.

39:16.813 --> 39:20.601
I'll talk to the station owner,
see if he can pull security tapes.

39:20.692 --> 39:25.402
That was mine. I won that, not Jacko.
