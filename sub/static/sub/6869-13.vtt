WEBVTT

00:02.265 --> 00:04.834
Time and
tide, they wait for no man.

00:04.835 --> 00:08.137
Nor do I, Mr. Tunt, nor do I.
And unless my demands are

00:08.138 --> 00:11.307
met, I will launch my nerve
gas missiles on New York,

00:11.308 --> 00:15.177
Washington and Miami in...
Eleven hours and -- oh look at

00:15.178 --> 00:17.780
that, eleven minutes.
Hey, make a wish.

00:17.781 --> 00:21.150
Uh, I wish you wouldn't
launch nerve gas missiles on

00:21.151 --> 00:23.351
New York, Washing-
And I wish you fools

00:23.471 --> 00:27.757
would stop destroying the oceans! Overfishing,
industrial runoff, don't even get me

00:27.758 --> 00:31.231
started on whaling, oh, and
plastic bottles?! That's --

00:31.351 --> 00:35.197
I can't even - there is a floating
mass of garbage in the Pacific

00:35.198 --> 00:38.334
twice the size of the United States!
Oh, and where the hell

00:38.335 --> 00:40.202
is the news crew I asked for?!

00:40.203 --> 00:44.640
With me! And with your permission,
I'm sending them down in the DSV.

00:44.641 --> 00:47.610
Good, yes! I need to
get my message to the world!

00:47.611 --> 00:49.078
Who'd you get? Oprah?

00:49.079 --> 00:50.312
Bigger.

00:50.313 --> 00:52.615
- Ya know...
- Hello. Is that her?

00:52.616 --> 00:55.585
I -- oh right,
he can't see us.

00:55.586 --> 00:58.821
Which has really got me...
nettled!

00:58.822 --> 01:05.862
Alright, Mr. Tunt, send them down.
But if this is some sort of ruse...

01:05.863 --> 01:09.264
Are -- was there
a follow-up, or...?

01:09.265 --> 01:11.000
No, I was leaving
the consequences to your

01:11.001 --> 01:16.105
imagination. But trust me, they are grave.
As in watery grave?

01:16.106 --> 01:18.440
I -
Sealab out!

01:18.441 --> 01:21.844
God damn it! Off! Turn
off, you...

01:21.845 --> 01:26.248
- So, I have a question...
- How are none of these a minibar?!

01:26.249 --> 01:29.218
Oh my God, I know what
you mean, right? I mean it is a

01:29.219 --> 01:30.920
giant floating biodiesel-

01:30.921 --> 01:32.555
powered hotel room...

01:32.556 --> 01:33.723
Don't get snotty with

01:33.724 --> 01:36.792
me, missy! You people lure us
out here to help the government

01:36.793 --> 01:39.562
recover a hydrogen bomb-
Which, let's be honest,

01:39.563 --> 01:40.997
you were going to
hold for ransom.

01:40.998 --> 01:43.733
Reward! When the whole
time you knew this crazy Murphy

01:43.734 --> 01:46.636
character was going to bomb
New York with nerve gas?!

01:46.637 --> 01:47.302
Well!

01:47.303 --> 01:49.104
Not to mention D.C.
and Miami.

01:49.105 --> 01:50.840
Which no one
who matters will miss.

01:50.841 --> 01:52.474
What about your
South Beach condo?

01:52.475 --> 01:55.177
Hello! Florida real
estate collapse! It's farther

01:55.178 --> 01:59.114
underwater than Sealab. But if
my homeowner's policy covers

01:59.115 --> 02:01.350
nerve gas attacks,
that's a win-win.

02:01.351 --> 02:05.588
Wow. So my question,
ignoring the obvious one of why

02:05.589 --> 02:08.190
an ocean research lab has nerve
gas missiles in the first

02:08.191 --> 02:12.327
place! Is how many men
does Murphy have?

02:12.328 --> 02:14.830
Mmmmmlike, two?

02:14.831 --> 02:15.965
Oh, then -

02:15.966 --> 02:17.466
Score. Two score, so

02:17.467 --> 02:20.135
around forty, sorry, should've

02:20.136 --> 02:21.303
finished that thmmpf.

02:21.304 --> 02:24.473
Sooo, since we're talking
about forty hostiles, I

02:24.474 --> 02:25.841
have a follow up question.

02:25.842 --> 02:28.878
Something
something danger zone?!

02:28.879 --> 02:31.847
- Ahhhhh!
- I know, I'm not even trying anymore.

02:31.848 --> 02:34.116
Archer-
Noop! Randy! I'm

02:34.117 --> 02:36.285
Cameradude Randy, and this

02:36.286 --> 02:40.056
pathetic, trout-shouldered excuse
for a boom operator is Chet.

02:40.057 --> 02:42.692
Shut up, what's
pathetic is your plan!

02:42.693 --> 02:44.994
Wait, you have
an actual plan?

02:44.995 --> 02:47.930
Duh, yes Lana. So,
obviously they're gonna search

02:47.931 --> 02:52.367
us for weapons when we get down
there, so wait whaaaaaaaat?

02:52.368 --> 02:54.436
Something else danger zone.

02:54.437 --> 02:56.405
Get Murphy alone, get
him at gunpoint, and make him

02:56.406 --> 02:59.208
disarm the missiles. Ya know,
that might actually work.

02:59.209 --> 03:02.712
Of course it'll work, I've thought
through every aspect of the mission.

03:02.713 --> 03:05.781
Hence those ridiculous
fake mustaches, since Murphy's

03:05.782 --> 03:09.118
never seen you before and has
no idea what you look like?

03:09.119 --> 03:10.853
God damn it, Archer!

03:10.854 --> 03:13.856
No, that was just an experiment.
I wanted to see if Ray looked

03:13.857 --> 03:15.124
gayer without his.

03:15.125 --> 03:20.096
- Ya know...
- But you don't. You just look as gay.

03:20.097 --> 03:21.230
Boop.

Sea Tunt to DSV Goddess.
Wait for my command to

03:58.736 --> 04:00.037
disengage the coupler.

04:00.038 --> 04:02.706
Roger Sea Tunt, on your-
Noop! Lana

04:02.707 --> 04:03.540
move, I'm skippering.

04:03.541 --> 04:06.043
- Archer, no!
- Goddammit I'm skippering!

04:06.044 --> 04:08.478
AAHHHHH!!!

04:08.479 --> 04:12.682
Huh. Mildly
inauspicious.

04:12.683 --> 04:13.683
Asshole.

04:13.684 --> 04:16.452
What Lana, I clearly
called "skipper!" And I clearly

04:16.454 --> 04:20.991
said "seatbelts," so... You
only have yourselves to blame.

04:20.992 --> 04:21.725
Really?

04:21.726 --> 04:23.860
Jesus, Ray!
Your nose is broken!

04:23.861 --> 04:24.661
Really?

04:24.662 --> 04:26.530
Cyril, gear bag!
First aid kit!

04:26.531 --> 04:29.733
Just give him a couple of tampons.
What, that's their job.

04:29.734 --> 04:30.500
Really?

04:30.501 --> 04:32.702
Just give him some tam-
I don't have any!

04:32.703 --> 04:34.738
Do you...
think that was wise?

04:34.739 --> 04:36.006
Meaning?

04:36.007 --> 04:38.342
Well I'm just assuming,
I mean, your breasts

04:38.343 --> 04:40.277
are slightly bigger, you're-
Shut your stupid

04:40.278 --> 04:43.513
mustachey dickhole and drive
the goddamn submarine!

04:43.514 --> 04:45.682
Slightly irritable?

04:45.683 --> 04:47.084
Shut up!

04:47.085 --> 04:49.086
Jesus, will you drop it?!

04:49.087 --> 04:50.921
He tried to have me committed
so he could steal my

04:50.922 --> 04:54.391
inheritance! I hate him and I'm
never speaking to him again ever!

04:54.392 --> 04:57.995
But -- okay granted, that
was super shitty. But trust me,

04:57.996 --> 05:00.197
you don't want to go through
life hating your only sibling.

05:00.198 --> 05:04.034
- Take my sister Edie...
- Ha, ha, ha, you have a sister?

05:04.035 --> 05:06.636
Edie, yes, shut up, and
when we were kids she was so

05:06.637 --> 05:10.274
mean to me? Always teasing me,
calling me Spamela, rubbing

05:10.275 --> 05:13.577
cheese curds in my eyes? One
time she stabbed me in the neck?

05:13.578 --> 05:15.946
So, now you
guys are super-close, or...?

05:15.947 --> 05:18.949
Ha ha ha, hell no, I wouldn't
piss on her neck-stabbin ass if

05:18.950 --> 05:20.217
it was on fire.

05:20.218 --> 05:22.152
Ugh, is this
the infamous Edie?

05:22.153 --> 05:24.121
Yeah, Pam thinks
I should forgive Cecil since

05:24.122 --> 05:25.856
he's the only
family I have left.

05:25.857 --> 05:29.093
Who could forgive a person who
buys a boat this big with no bar on it?!

05:29.094 --> 05:31.495
There was a ton
of booze on the helicopter...

05:31.496 --> 05:35.299
- Exactly, was...
- Yeah sorry, I had to ditch it.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.667
Well yeah, who needs a
first aid kit when you've got

05:37.668 --> 05:38.835
ten gallons of booze?!

05:38.836 --> 05:42.139
Three and three-fifths
gallons, Cyril, and I counted

05:42.140 --> 05:43.573
'em so keep your mitts off!

05:43.574 --> 05:48.178
Except to pass me one up here, but-
Oh great! The world's first DSVUI!

05:48.179 --> 05:50.647
May I finish?! But
since I have zero experience

05:50.648 --> 05:54.018
skippering submersibles, I
should probably have something

05:54.019 --> 05:58.288
light! So Cyril, I'm
thinking coffee liqueur?

05:58.289 --> 06:00.924
I mean, not
even cooking sherry?

06:00.925 --> 06:03.160
I got some Kentucky Moon in my-
Ooh, gimme!

06:03.161 --> 06:05.829
Dut dut dut dut! You drink
it, you replace it. Grain

06:05.830 --> 06:08.432
alcohol's a key component
of a good bug-out bag.

06:08.433 --> 06:09.433
A what?

06:09.434 --> 06:12.969
Bug-out bag? Oh
my God, for teotwaki?!

06:12.970 --> 06:14.505
The bear
from Star Wars?

06:14.506 --> 06:16.873
The end of the
world as we know it!

06:16.874 --> 06:20.444
Pam's like, gay
for doomsday, she thinks our

06:20.445 --> 06:24.381
whole society's gonna collapse if
we run out of oil or whatever.

06:24.382 --> 06:28.352
If?! You mean when!
Wow, and that is a perfect

06:28.353 --> 06:31.055
example of a pre-post-peak-oil

06:31.056 --> 06:32.022
mindset. The --

06:32.023 --> 06:35.292
Ahhh. Say, this stuff

06:35.293 --> 06:37.394
is pretty good. What
did you say it was?

06:37.395 --> 06:38.995
Basically pure ethanol?

06:38.996 --> 06:41.831
Huh. Well God
bless corn subsidies.

06:41.832 --> 06:44.301
Who're
you, Earl Butz?

06:44.302 --> 06:46.403
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

06:46.404 --> 06:48.539
Oh for the--
I said I was sorry!

06:48.540 --> 06:49.906
No you didn't!

06:49.907 --> 06:51.641
Oh. Well I
was planning to.

06:51.642 --> 06:53.043
Oh, well
then no hard feelings.

06:53.044 --> 06:55.279
Good, because your
shitty sarcasm notwithstanding,

06:55.280 --> 06:58.315
I'm glad that's behind us so we
can enjoy what is probably a

06:58.316 --> 07:00.984
once in a lifetime ad-
Rrrowrff!

07:00.985 --> 07:02.519
venture, again?

07:02.520 --> 07:04.854
Seriously? Why are
you puking so much?

07:04.855 --> 07:06.856
Ugh, because
shut up and steer.

07:06.857 --> 07:08.492
Here, take a
pull off this guy.

07:08.493 --> 07:10.527
No! For the
like, ninth time, no!

07:10.528 --> 07:13.464
Yes, c'mon, it'll take the edge off.
And I think I

07:13.465 --> 07:15.232
speak for everybody-
No you don't.

07:15.233 --> 07:19.169
-- shut up, when I say we'd all
be a lot happier if you weren't so...

07:19.170 --> 07:22.339
What, anxious?! About a
half-drunk first-time-driving-a-

07:22.340 --> 07:25.842
submarine idiot taking me to the
bottom of the ocean to face

07:25.843 --> 07:28.979
forty eco-terrorists led by a
crazy person who's about to

07:28.980 --> 07:33.016
bomb the entire east
coast with nerve gas?!

07:33.017 --> 07:36.853
I was gonna say-
What?! What were you gonna say?!

07:36.854 --> 07:39.289
They're going to say
that I've gone insane, that

07:39.290 --> 07:45.996
I've lost my mind. And that's fine, let them.
Because the real insanity is the

07:45.997 --> 07:49.199
systematic, my God the almost
deliberate way, those bastards

07:49.200 --> 07:51.401
are destroying our oceans.

07:51.402 --> 07:55.705
And I hate that it's come to this, but
I truly don't see an alternative.

07:55.706 --> 08:00.611
So, you all know what you have to
do, and I know you won't fail me.

08:00.612 --> 08:06.216
Nor I you, gentlemen...
nor I you.

08:07.230 --> 08:14.069
I was gonna say "bitchy and
periody" but then I thought better of it.

08:18.938 --> 08:21.406
Okay, we're getting close.
Let's go over

08:21.407 --> 08:22.674
the legends again. Lana?

08:22.675 --> 08:26.678
I am tough-but-fair investigative
reporter Sojourner King.

08:26.679 --> 08:28.347
Which, ugh, whatever.

08:28.348 --> 08:29.547
Cyril?

08:29.548 --> 08:31.884
Chet, sound guy.

08:31.885 --> 08:34.719
That's it? C'mon Chet,
the devil's in the details!

08:34.720 --> 08:38.323
Like, I'm Randy Magnum, local
Emmy-winning cameraman and

08:38.323 --> 08:40.491
nationally ranked
pro kitesurfer.

08:40.493 --> 08:41.326
No you're not.

08:41.327 --> 08:42.494
Well Randy Magnum is!

08:42.495 --> 08:43.461
Ray, go.

08:43.462 --> 08:47.065
- I am segment producer Carl Channing...
- Oh my God, c'mon...

08:47.066 --> 08:49.067
And -- what's
Randy Magnum ranked?

08:49.068 --> 08:50.002
Fourth.

08:50.003 --> 08:52.137
And third-ranked
pro kitesurfer.

08:52.138 --> 08:53.705
What?! No you're not!

08:53.706 --> 08:54.572
Carl Channing is.

08:54.573 --> 08:56.608
Nobody is a nationally
ranked anything! That is the

08:56.609 --> 08:59.644
worst legend you could possibly
have, it would literally take

08:59.645 --> 09:01.346
ten seconds to check it out!

09:01.347 --> 09:02.814
Yeah, Carl.

09:02.815 --> 09:05.417
Okay, shut
up, there it is.

09:05.418 --> 09:08.921
Jeezy Petes,
that thing is huge!

09:08.922 --> 09:10.755
Sealab to DSV, over?

09:10.756 --> 09:12.824
This is-
This is DSV I'm skippering!

09:12.825 --> 09:14.592
Um, okay. You
sound pretty excited.

09:14.593 --> 09:16.895
I am, actually.
It's my first time.

09:16.896 --> 09:18.530
Hey, super.

09:18.531 --> 09:20.933
You're clear to dock, so
just head for the lights.

09:20.934 --> 09:22.734
And I'll be waiting for you.

09:23.769 --> 09:28.540
Was that -- did he sound -- do
you think this is some kind of trap?

09:28.541 --> 09:34.212
What? No, I don't think it's a trap!
Although I never do...

09:34.213 --> 09:35.914
And it very often is.

09:35.915 --> 09:39.918
- And that's how they died...
- Right?

09:39.919 --> 09:44.756
A little peach juice, a little
of that old Kentucky Moon, and... boom.

09:44.757 --> 09:46.925
You've almost got
yourself a Bellini.

09:46.926 --> 09:47.459
Mmmm!

09:47.460 --> 09:49.194
Holy shitsnacks!

09:49.195 --> 09:51.696
Well it's no Harry's
Bar, but here you don't have

09:51.697 --> 09:55.033
Hemingway grabbing
your tits every time you-

09:55.034 --> 09:57.635
Did I misread that?

09:57.636 --> 09:59.704
What do you think?

09:59.705 --> 10:01.106
No?

10:01.107 --> 10:03.108
No, my men
are guarding the missiles.

10:03.109 --> 10:04.476
Well there
goes that plan.

10:04.477 --> 10:05.610
What plan?

10:05.611 --> 10:10.282
To... do a one-on-one interview,
just you alone, with the missiles?

10:10.283 --> 10:12.650
No, we're doing it on the
bridge, I've already got it all set up.

10:12.651 --> 10:14.819
But I really think we
should do it wherever the

10:14.820 --> 10:17.990
missiles are, to underscore
the gravity of the -

10:17.991 --> 10:19.657
The bridge is
where the chair is.

10:19.658 --> 10:22.094
But-
The bridge is where the chair is!

10:22.095 --> 10:23.395
Yeah, Sojourner.

10:23.396 --> 10:24.729
Thank you, uh...?

10:24.730 --> 10:28.166
Randy, Randy Magnum,
I'm a local Emmy-winning

10:28.167 --> 10:30.568
cameraman and nash -
Nooo!

10:30.569 --> 10:33.338
-- shunally ranked pro
kitesurfer, second in the

10:33.339 --> 10:38.410
nation, actually, which even the most
cursory internet search will corroborate.

10:39.278 --> 10:40.645
I really doubt
we'll have time, Randy.

10:40.646 --> 10:44.082
We only have ten hours before
I'll be forced to launch my missiles.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.784
Which are where
again, exactly?

10:46.785 --> 10:47.852
You heard me!

10:47.853 --> 10:49.787
I want fifty million dollars!

10:49.788 --> 10:51.123
Pff, join the club.

10:51.124 --> 10:51.789
Right?

10:51.790 --> 10:54.559
That's how much I could've gotten
for the hydrogen bomb, so that's how

10:54.560 --> 10:57.429
much I -- what do you
mean, join the club?

10:57.430 --> 11:00.165
Oh, that's just an idiom, it means-
I know what it means,

11:00.166 --> 11:02.934
you toboggan-wearing ass,
why did she say it?!

11:02.935 --> 11:05.270
Oh. I assume
because I'm penniless?

11:05.271 --> 11:05.870
What?!

11:05.871 --> 11:08.040
Ha, ha, oh.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.207
Wait, what?

11:09.208 --> 11:11.343
That's why I
tried to get control of your

11:11.344 --> 11:14.712
inheritance. And I'm sorry
I did that, Beans. I just

11:14.713 --> 11:18.483
wanted to help people, but all these
foundations are so expensive.

11:18.484 --> 11:21.219
I know, but Cecil!
You really spent your

11:21.220 --> 11:23.155
whole inheritance on...
the poors?

11:23.156 --> 11:25.857
Well, and scientific research.
The Sealab alone cost

11:25.858 --> 11:27.225
two hundred million.

11:27.226 --> 11:29.661
Wh-?! How did
it cost that much?!

11:29.662 --> 11:31.796
Well apparently they
bought a bunch of nerve gas

11:31.797 --> 11:36.401
missiles, and hid that expense in the budget.
Which I never bothered to read.

11:36.402 --> 11:37.735
Or even look at.

11:37.736 --> 11:39.538
Look at this place!

11:39.539 --> 11:43.141
Such a colossal boondoggle! We
don't do any research, really,

11:43.142 --> 11:46.878
and building it, I mean, the
environmental impact was just insane!

11:46.879 --> 11:49.013
So... why did
you take a job here?

11:49.014 --> 11:51.916
To save the ocean! And
also my salary is six hundred

11:51.917 --> 11:53.552
thousand dollars a year.

11:53.553 --> 11:54.586
What!?

11:54.587 --> 11:57.089
I know, but don't put that in there.
Let me just read

11:57.090 --> 12:00.592
my list of demands. Ahem.
One, a fifty-year, worldwide

12:00.593 --> 12:04.429
moratorium on all fishing. Two-
I'm sorry, did you mean whaling?

12:04.430 --> 12:06.264
That's number
two, if you'll let me -

12:06.265 --> 12:08.133
Wait, you want
to end all fishing?

12:08.134 --> 12:09.434
For fifty years?!

12:09.435 --> 12:12.170
At least. The
fish have to replenish.

12:12.171 --> 12:15.373
Okay, that's it, I'm calling bullshit.
I want to see the missiles, now.

12:15.374 --> 12:18.776
What, no, you can't, you-
You don't have any missiles!

12:18.777 --> 12:21.513
Yes I do! I've got...
like fifty.

12:21.514 --> 12:22.714
Fifty.

12:22.715 --> 12:23.515
Ten?

12:23.516 --> 12:24.382
That's still a lot.

12:24.383 --> 12:29.687
Shut up. Captain Murphy, how long
have you been down here all alone?

12:29.688 --> 12:32.457
Two years.

12:32.458 --> 12:35.527
Nobody had been paid in months,
the foundation was broke...

12:35.528 --> 12:37.395
Not surprising,
given your salary.

12:37.396 --> 12:41.633
Yeah, paid three years in advance.
He is the world's worst negotiator.

12:41.634 --> 12:44.802
And you're, sorry, but
you've obviously had some kind

12:44.803 --> 12:47.672
of psychotic break, so I think
you should come with us, and -

12:47.673 --> 12:50.041
I'm not going anywhere!
Nor are you!

12:50.042 --> 12:51.109
Lanaaa!

12:51.110 --> 12:52.110
Archerrrr!

12:52.111 --> 12:53.211
Murpheeee!

12:53.212 --> 12:57.115
I -- dammit, I had something
about point-and-shoot, but -

12:57.116 --> 13:00.051
A gun?! Are you insane, don't you
know how much pressure we're under?!

13:00.052 --> 13:03.321
Honestly, and I don't know why
this is, but it never really gets to me.

13:03.322 --> 13:05.957
Wait, I think he
means water pressure!

13:05.958 --> 13:09.594
And air pressure! The tiniest
hole in the hull would be catastrophic!

13:09.595 --> 13:11.996
The hole!
Is gonna be in you!

13:11.997 --> 13:12.797
Archer, no! Don't shoot.

13:12.798 --> 13:14.899
Okay okay,
look, it's gone!

13:14.900 --> 13:16.701
Now please, put the gun away!

13:16.702 --> 13:19.871
No, I will put on the safety!
Which should be...

13:19.872 --> 13:22.974
dammit, I wish Krieger
wouldn't do these idiot mods.

13:23.676 --> 13:29.080
Duhduhduhduhduhduhduhduh bow dow dow dowwwwwwww!
Dow dow dadowwwwwwwww!

13:29.081 --> 13:31.483
Wait, yeah, that
clearly says "safe," and even

13:31.484 --> 13:33.851
Krieger's not that crazy...

13:33.852 --> 13:37.455
Okay, now slowly
kick the knife over to-

13:37.456 --> 13:37.955
Dammit!

13:37.956 --> 13:39.524
Oh my God...!

13:39.525 --> 13:43.061
Okay, okay, okay, uh,
okay, one of two things is

13:43.062 --> 13:45.129
going to happen now...

13:45.130 --> 13:46.264
Oh! Okay! Oohhh!

13:46.865 --> 13:48.032
Aahhhh!

13:48.033 --> 13:52.870
Okay, now one of one thing
is going to hap-

13:52.871 --> 13:53.438
OHHHH..

13:55.040 --> 13:59.277
- Uh? Well now there's no signal at all...
- Wow, oh my God, I'm

13:59.278 --> 14:01.946
having the weirdest
déjà vu right now.

14:01.947 --> 14:02.747
Ya know...

14:02.748 --> 14:03.781
Here, lemme jailbreak

14:03.782 --> 14:05.083
your phone, it's a totally

14:05.084 --> 14:06.651
reversible process.

14:06.652 --> 14:08.353
Oh, bricked it!

14:11.660 --> 14:13.895
OOOOHHHHHH!!!!

14:13.896 --> 14:14.997
Hatch!

14:14.998 --> 14:16.831
Emergency hatch!

14:19.535 --> 14:22.070
We don't wanna
go outside, idiot!

14:22.071 --> 14:23.405
It's the next pod!

14:23.406 --> 14:25.307
Oh, duh.

14:25.308 --> 14:27.742
I'll hold it open!
Go, go!

14:27.743 --> 14:29.011
Aaaagh... ungh!

14:29.012 --> 14:30.379
- Aaaagh...
- Aaaagh...

14:30.380 --> 14:33.015
No no no no no -- Assholes.

14:33.016 --> 14:35.884
Wooohooohooohooooooof!

14:35.885 --> 14:37.419
Ow.

14:37.420 --> 14:41.923
Pod One, flooded.
Pod Two, flooding.

14:41.924 --> 14:47.362
So what, now we die in... a break
room I would die to have at ISIS?!

14:47.363 --> 14:48.263
Right?

14:48.264 --> 14:50.365
Maybe not, if he shuts the ha-
Aaaaaaagh!

14:52.035 --> 14:53.001
Ewwww!

14:53.002 --> 14:57.339
- Rrrgh, and I just refilled the cans...
- C'mon you guys,

14:57.340 --> 14:58.273
get it off of him!

14:58.274 --> 15:02.444
- No no, there's no time...
-  Plus I think

15:02.445 --> 15:04.946
the weight of it's the only
thing holding in my intestines.

15:04.947 --> 15:05.747
Eww.

15:05.748 --> 15:08.850
Save yourselves. Let
this compartment flood, up to

15:08.851 --> 15:13.288
that next hatch... Then seal
it behind you, and run.

15:13.289 --> 15:16.425
This is pod two, it's about
a hundred yards to the

15:16.426 --> 15:23.231
DSV at pod six, but pods three through
six are still watertigh-

15:23.232 --> 15:27.402
Pod three,
four, five, six. Flooded.

15:27.403 --> 15:28.470
Aaaghhh!

15:28.471 --> 15:32.674
Yeah, that's not ideal.
Okay, there's -wait, why

15:32.675 --> 15:34.609
did a TV crew have a gun?!

15:34.610 --> 15:37.546
We're not a TV
crew, we're from ISIS.

15:37.547 --> 15:40.915
ISIS?! Jesus Christ, no
wonder this all went tits up.

15:40.916 --> 15:41.616
Hey!

15:41.617 --> 15:44.953
Forgive my candor, I
just felt my spleen slip out of

15:44.954 --> 15:49.591
what was my anus.  That
locker over there, open it.

15:49.592 --> 15:52.760
Scuba gear!

15:53.329 --> 15:54.028
Dibs on best!

15:54.029 --> 15:56.298
Oooh, y'all I'm not
certified, is that gonna be a problem?

15:56.299 --> 16:01.236
- Well, not the biggest problem...
- There's only three.

16:01.237 --> 16:03.671
- Sooo...
- So one of you is going to drown.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.607
- Yep, got that...
- Temporarily.

16:05.608 --> 16:06.341
What?

16:06.342 --> 16:08.810
Hundred yards to the DSV.
Best case, for a strong

16:08.811 --> 16:11.813
swimmer, two minutes.

16:11.814 --> 16:14.749
The water's ice cold, help delay
the brain damage. Use the

16:14.750 --> 16:18.153
defibrillator on the DSV...
to restart the heart.

16:18.154 --> 16:19.421
Yeah but whose heart?!

16:19.422 --> 16:23.625
Weakest swimmer.

16:23.626 --> 16:25.360
Wh-? Aww, screw you guys!

16:25.361 --> 16:29.598
What, Lana, this isn't -- entirely
about race! Guys, back me up here.

16:29.599 --> 16:33.168
Well I was all-county in the
hundred meter freestyle in tenth grade...

16:33.169 --> 16:36.004
- And I have bionic legs...
- Plus I'm super scared...

16:36.005 --> 16:37.272
Plus you're a woman?

16:37.273 --> 16:40.008
I -- yeah, a
pregnant woman!

16:40.009 --> 16:40.875
What?

16:40.876 --> 16:42.944
That's why I haven't
been drinking, that's why I've

16:42.945 --> 16:46.314
been puking, and that's
why my boobs are so huge!

16:46.315 --> 16:48.049
Well I wouldn't
say "huge," but -

16:48.050 --> 16:49.651
When were you
planning to tell me?!

16:49.652 --> 16:53.488
When I finally figured
out how to tell you it's not yours.

16:53.489 --> 16:54.689
Gnk?

16:54.690 --> 17:00.028
- Awwwkwaaaard...
-  Ignore me, sorry, I'm

17:00.029 --> 17:04.732
dying. Crushed, by an off-brand
drink machine.  Oh my

17:04.733 --> 17:12.207
- God, just like that old gypsy woman srgbgh...
- Gnnk! Gnnk! Gn -

17:12.208 --> 17:15.877
Get it together! We both know
this isn't your first time as a cuckold!

17:15.877 --> 17:19.914
Or at least now we both know it.
And for real? You're pregnant?

17:19.915 --> 17:22.849
Five weeks, long story, yes, but-
Shut up. Here.

17:22.851 --> 17:25.186
Wh-? But-
Ray's half robot,

17:25.188 --> 17:26.954
Cyril, miraculously, is good at

17:26.954 --> 17:31.059
something, and... Lana, you're gonna be a mom!
Just promise me

17:31.060 --> 17:33.495
you'll be a better
one than mine.

17:33.496 --> 17:35.096
Because I'm worried
something may have gone

17:35.097 --> 17:37.566
- terribly wrong down there...
- Well if it did, we

17:37.567 --> 17:40.468
can't do anything about it, and
if it didn't, all the more

17:40.469 --> 17:45.173
reason to drive this tub to Bermuda
for some duty-free champagne!

17:45.174 --> 17:47.842
Archer, that
shouldn't be that hard.

17:47.843 --> 17:50.845
Ff-ff-ffrasing...

17:50.846 --> 17:54.449
Okay, here it comes! You just gotta
relax and let it go in your mouth!

17:54.450 --> 17:57.452
Ff-ff-
ffrasinglrrgllrg...!

17:57.453 --> 17:58.386
Archer?!

17:58.387 --> 17:59.787
Laggaah?

17:59.788 --> 18:10.465
- Gly gluggve ggglooo...
- I know. Ray, now!

18:10.466 --> 18:11.633
C'mon, hurry!

18:11.634 --> 18:14.802
Move! Scarlet
Letter O'Whora!

18:14.803 --> 18:16.638
Cyril! It was a...!

18:16.639 --> 18:18.640
Donor, you shithead.

18:18.641 --> 18:23.811
C'mon, hang on Archer, two minutes!
Your brain can -- almost spare that!

18:23.812 --> 18:26.348
So hey, this may be a
weird question, but you know

18:26.349 --> 18:27.482
where she's registered?

18:27.483 --> 18:30.151
Wh-?! What do you think?!

18:30.152 --> 18:32.820
Lanaaa!
Would you hurry up?!

18:32.821 --> 18:35.223
Said the guy
apparently too busy counting

18:35.224 --> 18:37.058
his bionic legs to help!

18:37.059 --> 18:40.828
You're gonna sass yourself right
out of a carseat! Now c'mon, hurry!

18:41.997 --> 18:44.132
Cyril! Get
ready on the airlock!

18:44.133 --> 18:46.401
- Yeah, yeah...
- Here, go go go go go.

18:46.402 --> 18:47.502
I got him I got him!

18:47.503 --> 18:48.836
Cyril now, blow it!

18:48.837 --> 18:50.472
Blow me,
boom, nailed it.

18:56.479 --> 18:57.178
Clear?!

18:57.179 --> 18:57.812
Clear!

18:58.781 --> 18:59.381
Again!

18:59.382 --> 19:01.849
C'mon,
he's dead let it go!

19:01.850 --> 19:02.517
Clear?!

19:02.518 --> 19:03.184
Clear!

19:06.756 --> 19:07.589
Archer?!

19:07.590 --> 19:08.623
Oh!

19:08.624 --> 19:10.124
Is he...? Are you...?

19:10.125 --> 19:11.760
The man who
cheated death?!

19:11.761 --> 19:12.960
Oh! Thank God.

19:12.961 --> 19:16.431
Oh my God, Archer, I can't -- I
mean, I don't even know how to thank you!

19:16.432 --> 19:17.599
Well, you could name

19:17.600 --> 19:19.133
your kid after -
Noop.

19:19.134 --> 19:22.704
Then just get me topside. I need
to brush Ray's tongue out of my mouth.

19:22.705 --> 19:24.339
I didn't give
you mouth to mouth!

19:24.340 --> 19:30.978
C'mon, admit it, you Frenched me!
You can lie but your boner can't!

19:30.979 --> 19:32.681
Cut it out, Archer!

19:32.682 --> 19:35.183
Yeah, look at ya!
All blushy!

19:35.184 --> 19:40.054
Archer be careful, the defibrillator-

19:40.055 --> 19:43.191
- So. Although Sealab was destroyed...
- It was insured for

19:43.192 --> 19:46.093
three times its value, so
now I'm richer than ever.

19:46.094 --> 19:50.365
And I have forgiven you,
for being such an incorrigible douche.

19:50.366 --> 19:51.599
No one cares, because

19:51.600 --> 19:52.967
most importantly -

19:52.968 --> 19:54.001
I cheated not only

19:54.002 --> 19:57.639
death, but also somehow
irreparable brain damage!

19:57.640 --> 20:00.107
That remains to be seen,
and shut up, because Lana
