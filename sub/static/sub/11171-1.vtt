<i>There he lies.</i>

01:25.705 --> 01:28.967
<i>God rest his soul,
and his rudeness.</i>

01:33.505 --> 01:37.961
<i>A devouring public can now share
the remains of his sickness,</i>

01:38.038 --> 01:40.630
<i>and his phone numbers.</i>

01:42.605 --> 01:44.595
<i>There he lay...</i>

01:44.672 --> 01:46.035
<i>poet,</i>

01:46.105 --> 01:47.537
<i>prophet,</i>

01:47.605 --> 01:49.037
<i>outlaw,</i>

01:49.106 --> 01:50.696
<i>fake.</i>

01:50.772 --> 01:53.602
<i>Star of electricity.</i>

01:53.672 --> 01:56.536
<i>Nailed by a peeping Tom</i>

01:56.605 --> 01:58.298
<i>who would soon discover...</i>

01:58.372 --> 02:02.134
A poem is like a naked person.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.194
<i>Even the ghost...</i>

02:04.272 --> 02:06.204
<i>was more than one person.</i>

02:13.505 --> 02:16.698
But a song is something
that walks by itself.

02:23.605 --> 02:27.401
<i># Aw, the ragman draws circles #</i>

02:27.472 --> 02:30.768
<i># Up and down the block #</i>

02:30.839 --> 02:34.271
<i># I'd ask him what the matter was #</i>

02:34.338 --> 02:37.395
<i># But I know that he don't talk #</i>

02:37.472 --> 02:41.132
<i># And the ladies treat me kindly #</i>

02:41.206 --> 02:44.865
<i># And they furnish me with tape #</i>

02:44.939 --> 02:48.394
<i># But deep inside my heart #</i>

02:48.473 --> 02:51.961
<i># I know I can't escape #</i>

02:52.039 --> 02:55.095
<i># Oh, Mama #</i>

02:55.172 --> 02:58.536
<i># Can this really be the end #</i>

02:58.604 --> 03:02.059
<i># To be stuck inside of Mobile #</i>

03:02.138 --> 03:05.696
<i># With the Memphis blues again? #</i>

03:08.206 --> 03:11.569
<i># Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley #</i>

03:11.639 --> 03:15.093
<i># With his pointed shoes and his bells #</i>

03:15.172 --> 03:18.604
<i># Speaking to some French girl #</i>

03:18.671 --> 03:22.001
<i># Who says she knows me well #</i>

03:22.071 --> 03:25.799
<i># And I would send a message #</i>

03:25.872 --> 03:29.168
<i># To find out if she's talked #</i>

03:29.239 --> 03:32.966
<i># But the post office has been stolen #</i>

03:33.039 --> 03:36.527
<i># And the mailbox is locked #</i>

03:36.604 --> 03:40.002
<i># Oh, Mama #</i>

03:40.071 --> 03:43.004
<i># Can this really be the end #</i>

03:43.072 --> 03:46.561
<i># To be stuck inside of Mobile #</i>

03:46.639 --> 03:49.900
<i># With the Memphis blues again? #</i>

03:52.672 --> 03:56.331
<i># Now the rain man gave me two cures #</i>

03:56.405 --> 03:59.599
<i># Then he said, "Jump right in" #</i>

03:59.672 --> 04:03.297
<i># The one was Texas medicine #</i>

04:03.372 --> 04:06.668
<i># The other was just railroad gin #</i>

04:06.739 --> 04:10.069
<i># And like a fool I mixed them #</i>

04:10.139 --> 04:13.571
<i># And it strangled up my mind #</i>

04:13.639 --> 04:17.002
<i># And now people just get uglier #</i>

04:17.071 --> 04:20.764
<i># And I have no sense of time #</i>

04:20.839 --> 04:24.236
<i># Oh, Mama #</i>

04:24.305 --> 04:27.567
<i># Can this really be the end #</i>

04:27.639 --> 04:31.037
<i># To be stuck here inside of Mobile #</i>

04:31.106 --> 04:34.901
<i># With the Memphis blues again? #</i>

04:56.105 --> 04:59.538
Hey. How old are you, boy?

04:59.605 --> 05:02.332
Eleven years old.

05:02.405 --> 05:03.803
Oh.

05:04.806 --> 05:06.363
What's your name, son?

05:06.440 --> 05:08.667
Woody.

05:08.739 --> 05:09.966
Woody Guthrie.

05:10.039 --> 05:12.505
Just like the singer.

05:13.672 --> 05:14.762
Way I see it,

05:14.838 --> 05:18.100
singin's kept me right in this world
more than any Bible's ever done.

05:19.905 --> 05:21.894
And somethin' else I learned?

05:21.971 --> 05:25.063
Takes just about a fountain pen
to get yourself robbed.

05:26.473 --> 05:29.233
Hey, Joe. What do you
make about that?

05:31.405 --> 05:33.337
Uh, son...

05:33.405 --> 05:37.269
you wouldn't be stashin' no weapons
in that case of yours?

05:37.338 --> 05:40.327
No, sir. Not in any literalized way.

05:41.938 --> 05:44.837
What'd you say his name was?

05:44.906 --> 05:47.031
<i>A- R-T-H.</i>

05:47.106 --> 05:49.129
Please sit down.

05:54.439 --> 05:58.201
"A-R-T-H-U-R...

05:58.272 --> 06:01.830
R-I-M-B-A-U-D."

06:03.072 --> 06:05.163
Born October 20th.

06:05.238 --> 06:08.467
That makes you 19,
nearly 20.

06:08.539 --> 06:09.834
Is that correct?

06:09.906 --> 06:11.394
That's correct.

06:13.572 --> 06:15.060
So what's all this about?

06:15.138 --> 06:17.331
Well, Missouri, originally.

06:17.405 --> 06:19.268
A little town called Riddle.

06:19.338 --> 06:22.327
But all over, really.

06:22.405 --> 06:25.337
Been to Gallup, Phillipsburg,
Sioux Falls...

06:25.405 --> 06:27.701
I got me a cousin in Sioux Falls.

06:27.772 --> 06:30.567
Yeah! That's right.

06:30.639 --> 06:33.366
Uh, is there really
a town called Riddle?

06:33.439 --> 06:37.201
Tell you the flat truth,
that's sort of a... a whatchamacallit.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.431
A, uh...

06:38.504 --> 06:39.993
A composite.

06:40.071 --> 06:42.867
A compost heap is more like it.

06:46.672 --> 06:49.934
Truth is, my mind
got mixed with ramblin'

06:50.006 --> 06:51.335
when I was, oh, so young.

06:51.405 --> 06:54.200
I reckon it was Arvella Gray,

06:54.272 --> 06:57.067
the blind protest singer from Chicago.

06:57.138 --> 06:59.570
She first taught me the blues

06:59.639 --> 07:00.798
four...

07:00.872 --> 07:02.895
about five years back.

07:02.972 --> 07:05.937
That's also when I first started
writin' songs on my own.

07:06.005 --> 07:07.471
I've written some hillbilly songs.

07:07.539 --> 07:09.300
You know Carl Perkins,
from Nashville?

07:09.372 --> 07:10.304
Yeah, yeah.

07:10.373 --> 07:12.736
He sings some of my songs.

07:12.806 --> 07:14.998
Yep. Talkin' blues kind
of stuff, you know?

07:15.071 --> 07:17.128
Union songs.

07:17.205 --> 07:20.365
I also played piano with Bobby Vee.

07:20.439 --> 07:23.836
I would've been a millionaire
if I stayed with him.

07:25.705 --> 07:29.069
Well, what brings you
around these parts?

07:32.772 --> 07:34.634
Carelessness.

07:40.105 --> 07:42.536
<i>I lost my one true love.</i>

07:42.605 --> 07:45.037
<i>And I started drinking.</i>

07:48.772 --> 07:51.671
<i>Next thing I know, I'm in a crap game.</i>

07:51.740 --> 07:53.432
<i>I wake up in a pool hall.</i>

07:53.505 --> 07:55.528
<i>One night, I meet up with a Chinaman</i>

07:55.605 --> 07:59.560
<i>working at a dime store
who says he loves my sound.</i>

07:59.639 --> 08:01.468
<i>And next thing I know,</i>

08:01.539 --> 08:04.630
<i>I'm all booked up
at his boss's establishment.</i>

08:04.705 --> 08:06.728
The Tiny Troubadour!

08:06.806 --> 08:11.705
<i># I've been a... #</i>

08:11.772 --> 08:14.635
<i># Moonshiner #</i>

08:17.605 --> 08:23.504
<i># For 17 long years #</i>

08:27.138 --> 08:28.798
There you go, boy.

08:32.006 --> 08:33.198
<i>Of course, success ain't all</i>

08:33.272 --> 08:35.568
<i>it's cracked up to be, now.</i>

08:35.639 --> 08:38.104
There's something
sort of freakish, I suppose,

08:38.172 --> 08:41.831
setting someone up on stage
apart from all the rest,

08:41.905 --> 08:46.463
when down in every boxcar
there's men of all ranges bouncing together.

08:46.539 --> 08:49.334
You got hobos, nobos,
gentlemen loafers.

08:49.405 --> 08:52.530
One or all-time losers.

08:52.605 --> 08:55.571
Call us what you will.

08:55.639 --> 08:57.763
Deep down, we're all getting ready

08:57.838 --> 09:01.202
to tuck our heads
under our wings for sleep.

09:01.272 --> 09:03.704
We of the Pullman side-car
and the sunburned thumb.

09:03.771 --> 09:07.465
We ain't kidding ourselves.

09:07.539 --> 09:09.334
It's lonesome roads we shall walk.

09:12.806 --> 09:15.237
Till I joined the Union cause!

09:17.938 --> 09:20.905
Don't he know it's 1959?

09:20.972 --> 09:23.937
We done unionized 20 years ago.

09:24.005 --> 09:28.063
Records indicate that you've been away,

09:28.139 --> 09:30.002
that you've stopped writing.

09:30.072 --> 09:31.298
I've been on too many streets

09:31.372 --> 09:33.338
to be doing the same thing
over and over.

09:33.405 --> 09:34.927
Can I smoke in here?

09:35.005 --> 09:36.301
You sound,

09:36.372 --> 09:38.099
for someone so widely known,

09:38.172 --> 09:39.103
a bit fatalistic.

09:39.172 --> 09:42.195
I'm not fatalistic.

09:42.272 --> 09:43.794
Bank tellers are fatalistic.

09:43.871 --> 09:45.064
Clerks are fatalistic.

09:45.138 --> 09:47.161
I'm a farmer.

09:47.238 --> 09:50.262
Who ever heard
of a fatalistic farmer?

09:53.805 --> 09:57.602
# The sweet, pretty things
are in bed now, of course #

09:57.672 --> 10:01.434
# The city fathers,
they're trying to endorse #

10:01.505 --> 10:05.198
# The reincarnation
of Paul Revere's horse #

10:05.272 --> 10:09.136
# But the town has no need
to be nervous #

10:09.205 --> 10:13.331
# The hysterical bride
in the penny arcade #

10:13.405 --> 10:17.031
# Screaming, she moans,
"I've just been made" #

10:17.105 --> 10:20.628
# Then sends out for the doctor
who pulls down the shade #

10:20.705 --> 10:24.535
# Says, "My advice
is to not let the boys in" #

10:24.605 --> 10:29.037
# Where Ma Raney and Beethoven
once unwrapped their bed roll #

10:29.105 --> 10:32.731
# Tuba players now rehearse
around the flagpole #

10:32.806 --> 10:34.668
# And the national bank for a profit #

10:34.738 --> 10:36.670
# Sells road maps for the soul #

10:36.738 --> 10:41.137
# To the old folks home
and the college #

10:41.205 --> 10:42.501
# Mama's in the factory #

10:42.572 --> 10:44.834
# She ain't got no shoes #

10:44.906 --> 10:46.633
# Daddy's in the alley #

10:46.705 --> 10:48.796
# He's lookin' for food #

10:48.872 --> 10:50.462
# I'm in the kitchen #

10:50.539 --> 10:54.198
# With the tombstone blues #

10:54.272 --> 10:57.397
# Hey, hey, yeah #

10:57.472 --> 10:58.596
Whoo!

11:00.305 --> 11:01.998
Oh!

11:04.372 --> 11:07.769
Boy, look like you found...
you found your freedom

11:07.838 --> 11:09.498
before you found your technique.

11:09.572 --> 11:12.300
Now, real American music
come from the bottom up.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.360
You take Blind Willie McTell.

11:14.438 --> 11:16.700
He's the best blues singer
east of Cannery Row.

11:16.771 --> 11:19.033
He say, "Son, if you can
sing these songs

11:19.105 --> 11:23.265
and understand them,
ain't no place you can't go.

11:23.338 --> 11:24.929
Ah, thank you very much, ma'am.

11:25.005 --> 11:26.028
You're welcome.

11:26.106 --> 11:27.469
I reckon I come out the womb

11:27.539 --> 11:29.630
singing and picking
and playing and all that mess.

11:29.705 --> 11:30.864
So where your people at?

11:30.939 --> 11:32.802
Your kinfolk?

11:32.872 --> 11:34.167
Oh, they back in Stockton, ma'am.

11:34.238 --> 11:36.261
California.
That's where I was raised.

11:36.337 --> 11:39.304
I figured they got plenty
of mouths to feed as it is.

11:39.372 --> 11:41.803
Not that I care a fig about material things,

11:41.871 --> 11:44.929
you know, except for
maybe a decent car.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.869
See, us thumb-slummers
and box-jumpers,

11:46.939 --> 11:49.131
we get a little peckish
when it comes to cars, you know?

11:49.205 --> 11:51.604
That boy sound just like Doughboy Hawkins,

11:51.672 --> 11:53.262
a fella I met in the Dust Bowl.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.497
Tell you what I think.
I think it's 1959,

11:55.572 --> 11:57.435
and this boy's singing
songs about the boxcar?

11:57.505 --> 12:00.027
Hmm. What a boxcar
gonna mean to him?

12:00.105 --> 12:03.935
Right here, we got race riots,
folks with no food.

12:04.005 --> 12:05.528
Why ain't he out there
singing about that?

12:05.605 --> 12:06.969
The boy a guest in our house.

12:07.038 --> 12:09.470
I know he's a guest.
I'm just trying to speak what's in my mind.

12:09.539 --> 12:10.766
No!

12:13.305 --> 12:15.134
Say it.

12:20.939 --> 12:24.769
Live your own time, child.

12:24.839 --> 12:26.805
Sing about your own time.

12:36.038 --> 12:37.436
<i>Greenwich Village,</i>

12:37.505 --> 12:40.164
<i>once the in spot
for beatnik jazz and bebop,</i>

12:40.238 --> 12:43.363
<i>is today home
to the popular folk music fad,</i>

12:43.439 --> 12:45.166
<i>a do-it-yourself musical expression</i>

12:45.238 --> 12:48.432
<i>that's attracted youngsters
from all across the nation.</i>

12:48.505 --> 12:51.471
<i>For them,
these homespun songs of the working man</i>

12:51.540 --> 12:53.027
<i>express a truth and candor</i>

12:53.105 --> 12:57.003
<i>sorely lacking in today's
growing consumer society.</i>

12:57.071 --> 13:00.265
Why do you prefer folk music
to other types of music?

13:00.337 --> 13:02.861
Because it's honest.

13:02.939 --> 13:05.768
Commercial songs,
pop music can't be honest.

13:05.838 --> 13:09.066
It's controlled and censored
by the people who run society

13:09.138 --> 13:10.468
and make the rules.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.937
<i>Yet, among the many new</i>

13:12.006 --> 13:13.766
<i>and talented artists to emerge,</i>

13:13.838 --> 13:16.360
<i>one name stands alone
as the heart and soul</i>

13:16.438 --> 13:18.631
<i>of this growing musical trend.</i>

13:18.704 --> 13:21.693
<i>A young individual
who both writes and performs</i>

13:21.771 --> 13:23.964
<i>some of his era's finest tunes,</i>

13:24.239 --> 13:25.726
<i>and hailed by the New York Times</i>

13:25.805 --> 13:29.033
<i>as folk music's
Troubadour of Conscience.</i>

13:29.105 --> 13:32.969
<i>His name is Jack Rollins.</i>

13:33.038 --> 13:34.901
<i>Jack Rollins,</i>

13:34.970 --> 13:37.301
<i>folk sensation of the early '60s,</i>

13:37.372 --> 13:39.803
<i>was the promise of a new generation.</i>

13:39.871 --> 13:41.860
<i>So what was it that made him run</i>

13:41.938 --> 13:44.530
<i>at the height of his career
and throw it all away,</i>

13:44.605 --> 13:48.594
<i>trading in the limelight
for a different kind of light altogether?</i>

13:48.672 --> 13:51.468
He saw what was going on
in the world,

13:51.540 --> 13:55.301
and he had the ability
to distill it into a song.

13:55.372 --> 13:57.395
He could do a funny thing.

13:57.472 --> 13:59.937
He could do a pathos thing.
He was sensational.

14:00.005 --> 14:04.028
# For the times, they are a-changin' #

14:07.472 --> 14:10.529
<i>Now, this young man has
taken to the hearts of young people</i>

14:10.605 --> 14:15.560
who seem to somehow identify with, uh...

14:15.638 --> 14:18.399
Jack, why do you think that is?

14:18.471 --> 14:20.369
Well, I don't know.

14:20.438 --> 14:23.234
I... I guess...

14:23.305 --> 14:26.567
I got a lot of thoughts inside of me,

14:26.639 --> 14:29.434
and most people, they...

14:29.505 --> 14:32.937
they... keep them all inside.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.459
And I guess it's for them
that I do what I do.

14:36.538 --> 14:38.470
<i>Today, the name Jack Rollins</i>

14:38.538 --> 14:40.698
<i>might best be remembered
as the tortured singer</i>

14:40.772 --> 14:43.999
<i>battling his conscience
in the 1965 drama,</i>

14:44.071 --> 14:45.401
Grain of Sand.

14:45.472 --> 14:47.165
<i>The role, of course,
that launched the career</i>

14:47.238 --> 14:49.261
<i>of Hollywood rebel Robbie Clark.</i>

14:49.338 --> 14:50.736
Hell, I don't pick what I sing.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.829
<i>It picks me.</i>

14:52.905 --> 14:54.201
Some of it ain't pretty.

14:54.271 --> 14:55.760
I mean, how you ever
gonna change anything

14:55.838 --> 14:57.633
if you only wanna show what's pretty?

14:57.704 --> 15:00.603
<i>In his first exclusive interview in 20 years...</i>

15:00.739 --> 15:06.365
Tonight, we bring you face-to-face
with the real Jack Rollins.

15:11.005 --> 15:14.869
# William Zanzinger
killed poor Hattie Carroll #

15:14.937 --> 15:17.200
# With a cane that he twirled #

15:17.272 --> 15:19.534
# 'Round his diamond ring finger #

15:19.604 --> 15:22.196
<i>He saw what was going on
in the world,</i>

15:22.271 --> 15:25.931
and he had the ability
to distill it into a song.

15:26.006 --> 15:27.801
And this elevated the discussion.

15:27.872 --> 15:29.838
I mean, certainly
within the folk world,

15:29.906 --> 15:33.701
but all through popular music,
the bar had risen.

15:33.771 --> 15:35.101
<i>Alice Fabian</i>

15:35.172 --> 15:38.104
<i>was herself a leading figure
in the folk revival,</i>

15:38.172 --> 15:40.138
<i>achieving international success</i>

15:40.205 --> 15:43.535
<i>a few years before
their first meeting in 1962.</i>

15:43.604 --> 15:47.059
Hey, you're in my chair.

15:48.505 --> 15:50.232
I was at a party in the Village,

15:50.305 --> 15:53.169
and this twerpy little kid
who'd been hanging around,

15:53.238 --> 15:55.795
kind of flirting with my baby sister
and kissing up to me,

15:55.871 --> 15:58.167
starts playing these songs
that he'd written on guitar.

15:58.237 --> 16:01.635
Now, this was '61, '62,

16:01.704 --> 16:04.194
and all anybody sang were traditionals,

16:04.272 --> 16:09.068
and here's this kid, applying traditional form
to contemporary concerns,

16:09.138 --> 16:11.127
but with such insight, you know?

16:11.205 --> 16:12.637
<i>It was devastating.</i>

16:12.705 --> 16:15.761
<i>You couldn't believe
this was coming out of this little toad.</i>

16:15.838 --> 16:19.770
<i>Nobody was writing songs like that.</i>

16:19.838 --> 16:21.599
It was as if he was giving voice to ideas

16:21.671 --> 16:25.104
that I wanted to express
but didn't know how.

16:25.172 --> 16:27.764
Um, his finger-pointing songs,
he called 'em.

16:27.839 --> 16:31.794
He was churning them out
like ticker tape.

16:31.872 --> 16:35.269
Well, folk music has always
been a political music,

16:35.338 --> 16:38.736
but he was really expressing
it as an art form

16:38.806 --> 16:42.670
in a way that was multileveled and very deep.

16:42.739 --> 16:46.694
# Hattie Carroll
was a maid of the kitchen #

16:46.772 --> 16:49.237
# She was 51 years old #

16:49.305 --> 16:51.533
# And gave birth to ten children #

16:51.605 --> 16:56.128
# Who carried the dishes
and took out the garbage #

16:56.204 --> 17:00.763
# And never sat once
at the head of the table #

17:00.838 --> 17:04.998
# And didn't even talk
to the people at the table #

17:05.071 --> 17:09.731
# She just cleaned up
all the food from the table #

17:09.806 --> 17:14.294
# And emptied the ashtrays
on a whole other level #

17:14.371 --> 17:19.430
# Got killed by a blow,
lay slain by a cane #

17:19.504 --> 17:20.493
<i>Every night,</i>

17:20.572 --> 17:22.867
<i>I would call this ragamuffin on stage</i>

17:22.938 --> 17:27.064
<i>and introduce America
to Jack Rollins.</i>

17:27.138 --> 17:29.400
<i>I'd say, you know,
that he has something to say,</i>

17:29.472 --> 17:33.268
<i>you know, and that he is...
he is speaking for me</i>

17:33.338 --> 17:35.826
<i>and everybody who wants
a better world.</i>

17:35.905 --> 17:41.167
# Oh, but you who
philosophize disgrace #

17:41.238 --> 17:45.533
# And criticize all fears #

17:45.604 --> 17:50.765
# Bury the rag deep in your face #

17:50.838 --> 17:54.326
# Now is the time for your tears #

17:54.404 --> 17:56.030
<i>He knows how to peel the surface</i>

17:56.105 --> 17:57.196
<i>from what he sees.</i>

17:57.272 --> 18:00.568
<i>His songs are like a true vision
of how things really are.</i>

18:00.639 --> 18:03.127
<i>Well, I just find
he's the most piercing</i>

18:03.205 --> 18:06.763
and aware insight working today.

18:06.838 --> 18:07.930
You'd have thought we invented it,

18:08.006 --> 18:10.198
we were so pleased and proud.

18:14.837 --> 18:18.235
Sure, there was a certain tendency
in the folk movement

18:18.304 --> 18:21.032
for nostalgia about the Depression

18:21.105 --> 18:24.072
and the radicalism
that came out of it.

18:24.138 --> 18:25.626
They were coming out
of a shitty time...

18:25.704 --> 18:28.069
the McCarthy era, Eisenhower era.

18:28.138 --> 18:31.901
<i>So, as long as folk remained
strictly a minority taste,</i>

18:31.972 --> 18:35.096
<i>it would always be us against the big, bad
commercial tastelessness.</i>

18:35.172 --> 18:37.603
<i>But when the big, bad commercial
tastelessness</i>

18:37.671 --> 18:40.638
<i>finally caught on to Jack,</i>

18:40.705 --> 18:44.103
<i>then, well, all of a sudden,</i>

18:44.172 --> 18:46.536
the race was on.

18:46.605 --> 18:48.832
And this time,
somebody was going to win.

18:48.905 --> 18:49.872
He was a rebel.

18:49.939 --> 18:51.802
I wanted to record protest.

18:51.872 --> 18:53.337
Of course, that's right
when we were getting

18:53.405 --> 18:55.394
into that whole Nam business.

18:55.571 --> 18:59.970
Jack really stopped protesting after 1963.

19:00.038 --> 19:04.300
He said that you couldn't
effect change with a song.

19:04.372 --> 19:07.031
You could only write
about what was inside you,

19:07.105 --> 19:10.333
and folk music, he said, was, um...

19:10.405 --> 19:12.496
was fat people.

19:12.572 --> 19:15.299
He said it made him feel
like the Establishment,

19:15.372 --> 19:18.668
you know, and he always
fought the Establishment.

19:18.739 --> 19:22.935
<i># You will search, babe #</i>

19:23.005 --> 19:26.937
<i># At any cost #</i>

19:31.005 --> 19:35.301
<i># Everybody will help you #</i>

19:36.905 --> 19:42.166
<i># Some people are very kind #</i>

19:42.238 --> 19:45.830
<i># And if I... #</i>

19:45.906 --> 19:50.497
<i># Can save you any time #</i>

19:53.238 --> 19:57.170
<i># Come on, give it to me #</i>

19:57.238 --> 19:59.999
<i># I'll keep it with mine #</i>

20:00.071 --> 20:01.661
<i>You don't have to write anything down</i>

20:01.738 --> 20:03.034
<i>to be a poet.</i>

20:03.105 --> 20:04.537
<i>Some work in gas stations.</i>

20:04.605 --> 20:06.763
Some shine shoes.

20:09.272 --> 20:12.636
I don't really call myself one,
'cause I don't like the word.

20:14.137 --> 20:16.730
Me, I'm a trapeze artist.

20:16.805 --> 20:22.261
<i>Sighting it and hearing it
and breathing it in,</i>

20:22.338 --> 20:24.429
<i>rubbing it all in the pores of my skin.</i>

20:24.505 --> 20:27.164
<i>And the wind between my eyes</i>

20:27.238 --> 20:30.102
<i>knocking honey in my comb.</i>

20:31.439 --> 20:34.199
You reckon he's some kind of midget?

20:34.271 --> 20:36.294
Get off of there, grunt!

20:36.371 --> 20:37.997
I ain't doing nothing!

20:39.871 --> 20:42.235
Now look what you done!

20:42.305 --> 20:43.999
You talk English?

20:45.372 --> 20:46.497
Yes, sir.

20:46.572 --> 20:48.094
You carrying money, boy?

20:48.172 --> 20:49.103
Weapons?

20:49.172 --> 20:50.229
N-No, sir.

20:50.305 --> 20:51.999
He's lying.

20:52.071 --> 20:53.400
What's that?

20:53.471 --> 20:55.494
That your fiddle? Huh?

20:55.571 --> 20:56.764
Give it back. Huh?

20:56.838 --> 20:59.895
What's it say on that thing?

20:59.971 --> 21:02.164
What you got stashed in here?

21:02.238 --> 21:03.396
Nothing!

21:03.471 --> 21:04.767
Get him, boys!

21:04.838 --> 21:06.600
Ahh!

21:09.639 --> 21:12.298
Ah, you little...

21:12.372 --> 21:14.166
Give me...

21:24.238 --> 21:27.671
This here young'un,
the Tiny Troubadour,

21:27.739 --> 21:29.728
is going to sing a little song.

21:29.806 --> 21:32.237
So what bring you around these parts?

21:32.305 --> 21:34.270
Could've sworn he was an older man.

21:34.337 --> 21:35.826
Live your own time, child.

21:35.905 --> 21:36.836
Get him, boys!

21:36.905 --> 21:38.928
You reckon he's
some kind of midget?

21:39.005 --> 21:41.527
<i>He's lying!</i>

21:43.138 --> 21:46.468
<i>I dreamed of the Crusades.</i>

21:46.539 --> 21:49.767
<i>Republics without history.</i>

21:49.839 --> 21:52.963
<i>Secret religious wars.</i>

21:53.038 --> 21:56.697
<i>I believed in every kind
of witchcraft.</i>

21:56.771 --> 21:59.532
<i>At first it was a study.</i>

21:59.604 --> 22:02.662
<i>I wrote out silences and nights.</i>

22:02.738 --> 22:05.533
<i>Later I determined vertigos.</i>

22:34.604 --> 22:36.763
<i>Here's the boot camps, with tanks, jeeps,</i>

22:36.838 --> 22:39.304
<i>bullet-shooting machine guns,
and 80 soldiers.</i>

22:48.105 --> 22:51.162
I just don't want to go.

22:51.239 --> 22:55.000
Oh, my poor, sad little thing.

22:56.639 --> 22:59.866
Do you know what a wonderful time
you're going to have...

22:59.938 --> 23:02.632
on a boat with the water?

23:02.704 --> 23:04.863
Sounds pretty neat
what your daddy's planned.

23:04.938 --> 23:07.097
Me, too!

23:08.838 --> 23:11.237
Why can't you come?

23:11.306 --> 23:14.429
Molly, you know I can't come.

23:14.504 --> 23:16.060
Is that why...

23:16.137 --> 23:18.797
you think you're feeling
nervous about the boat?

23:18.871 --> 23:20.029
Hmm?

23:20.104 --> 23:22.696
When's Daddy coming?

23:22.771 --> 23:24.999
Uh, Saturday, I think.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.264
I only spoke to Sally
because it's impossible

23:27.337 --> 23:28.531
to get your father on the phone.

23:30.338 --> 23:31.997
It's Emily.

23:32.071 --> 23:33.627
Molly, you didn't eat a thing.

23:41.438 --> 23:42.927
<i>Bonjour, Hotel Georges V.</i>

23:43.005 --> 23:44.335
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

23:58.905 --> 24:03.360
Robbie... how can you whistle?

24:03.438 --> 24:05.701
Who was that on the phone?

24:05.772 --> 24:07.101

27:32.938 --> 27:36.768
It's not about me anymore;
it's all about him.

Your guaranteed,

27:38.338 --> 27:41.168
double-your-money-back
voice of the people.

27:41.237 --> 27:43.999
You didn't answer my question.

27:44.071 --> 27:45.833
Once, maybe, you could sing

27:45.905 --> 27:47.599
about Mary Hamilton and lemon trees,

27:47.672 --> 27:52.104
or you can step out like me
and try and shake this flytrap.

27:53.337 --> 27:57.292
But they took away the meaning, Alice.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.996
I was a pawn in their game.

28:00.070 --> 28:01.229

28:33.371 --> 28:35.633
- Wait, you're French?
- Yeah, so?

28:35.704 --> 28:38.192
- Well, you gotta be kidding me.
- Why?

28:38.272 --> 28:39.498
No, nothing. It's perfect.

28:39.571 --> 28:41.264
You kidding?

28:43.171 --> 28:44.797
I think you're making a joke.

28:44.871 --> 28:46.269
Oh, no. No, no, no.

28:46.338 --> 28:48.496
No joke.

28:48.571 --> 28:50.537
Then what else
aside from being French

28:50.604 --> 28:51.831
you like so much about me?

28:51.905 --> 28:55.496
Your hair, your mouth,
your eyes, your lips.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.962
I see.

29:02.038 --> 29:04.970
So, um...

29:05.038 --> 29:06.334
You're an actor.

29:06.405 --> 29:08.768
Yeah, yeah. So?

29:10.704 --> 29:13.568
I like what you said in that scene.

29:13.638 --> 29:15.104
Uh, what scene?

29:15.171 --> 29:17.228
But they were just lines from a movie.

29:17.304 --> 29:18.861
- They were not...
- Wait, wait, wait. What scene?

29:18.938 --> 29:21.165
- What did you see?
- The scene in the lane.

29:21.237 --> 29:23.362
Hmm.

29:23.438 --> 29:27.565
I would like to know
what is at the center of your world.

29:27.639 --> 29:28.865
The center of my world?

29:28.938 --> 29:32.393
Uh...

29:32.471 --> 29:33.936
Well, you're no monkeying around.

29:34.004 --> 29:36.061
Why?

29:36.137 --> 29:37.796
It's very simple, this question.

29:37.870 --> 29:41.303
Um... hmm.

29:41.371 --> 29:44.496
Well, I'm 22.
I guess I would say me.

29:48.038 --> 29:49.732
I suppose you're honest.

29:49.805 --> 29:51.465
Well, don't you think
that you're the center

29:51.539 --> 29:53.867
or that you should be the center,

29:53.937 --> 29:57.063
thinking with your own head,
talking with your own mouth?

29:57.137 --> 29:58.194
Yeah.

29:58.272 --> 30:01.328
But there are things in the world, too,
that are important.

30:01.404 --> 30:02.961
I'm not denying that.

30:03.038 --> 30:04.799
That's not what I'm saying.

# Will be shaken #

36:03.237 --> 36:07.693
# And the tide will pound

36:07.771 --> 36:13.169
# And the mornin' will be a-breakin' #

36:13.237 --> 36:16.032
And no formal training?
Remarkable.

36:16.104 --> 36:18.764
# Sayin' we'll meet

36:43.738 --> 36:45.534
How about another helping?

36:45.604 --> 36:47.627
- Woody?
- Yes, ma'am.

36:47.704 --> 36:48.897
More wine, Woody?

36:48.971 --> 36:50.198
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

36:50.271 --> 36:52.101
Do you know
what your plans are from here?

36:52.172 --> 36:54.932
My only real plan
is to become a singer,

36:55.004 --> 36:56.868
a real singer on television,

36:56.937 --> 36:59.369
either that or a kind of voice
of the people, you know?

36:59.438 --> 37:00.563
Interesting.

37:00.638 --> 37:02.797
Because I've been
writing me some songs,

37:02.871 --> 37:05.860
songs about what's going on.

37:05.938 --> 37:07.165
And I'm going
to take these songs,

37:07.238 --> 37:09.795
and I'm going to head
straight to Hollywood.

37:09.871 --> 37:12.462
Going to make it big just like Elvis Presley.

37:12.538 --> 37:14.436
Well, Woody, I wouldn't be surprised

37:14.504 --> 37:15.628
if you did just that.

37:15.703 --> 37:17.397
- There you are, Woody.
- Thank you.

37:17.471 --> 37:21.961
And don't you go rushing off anyplace
until you feel 1000/0, you hear?

37:22.038 --> 37:23.128
Yes, ma'am.

37:23.204 --> 37:26.035
Have to mother you while you still have
a roof over your head.

37:27.938 --> 37:29.699
Who on earth?

37:29.771 --> 37:31.999
- Are you expecting a call?
- No.

37:33.870 --> 37:34.802
So, Hollywood?

37:34.871 --> 37:37.063
- Hello?
- Not Tin Pan Alley?

37:37.137 --> 37:40.365
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

37:40.438 --> 37:42.132
Minnesota?

37:42.204 --> 37:44.897
Well, how could...

37:44.970 --> 37:47.096
Dr. Field, yes.

37:47.172 --> 37:49.967
Would you hold on
just a moment, please?

37:50.038 --> 37:51.129
Esther?

37:51.205 --> 37:54.102
It's a juvenile center in Minnesota.

37:54.171 --> 37:55.102
A what?

37:55.171 --> 37:57.534
Something... Corrections.

37:57.603 --> 38:00.093
You talk to 'em, Jack.

38:00.172 --> 38:02.262
They think it's Woody.

38:02.337 --> 38:04.269
What do they know about Woody?

38:04.337 --> 38:06.599
They said they're looking for some...

38:06.671 --> 38:08.432
a juvenile, but...

38:08.504 --> 38:13.868
some state, you know, fugitive.

38:13.937 --> 38:16.529
Certainly not Woody.

38:47.871 --> 38:51.167
seeing and feeling
and breathing it in.

38:53.337 --> 38:55.598
Sucking down on it.

Rubbing it all

Room 300. Just set 'em inside.

39:52.271 --> 39:54.168
Thank you, ma'am.

40:08.471 --> 40:12.994
<i># Well, God is in His heaven #</i>

40:15.703 --> 40:19.726
<i># And we all want what's His #</i>

40:21.604 --> 40:27.128
<i># But power and greed
and corruptible seed #</i>

40:27.205 --> 40:32.227
<i># Seem to be all that there is #</i>

40:33.904 --> 40:37.802
<i># I'm gazin' out the window #</i>

40:39.905 --> 40:45.838
<i># Of the St. James Hotel #</i>

40:45.905 --> 40:51.735
<i># And I know no one
can sing the blues #</i>

40:51.805 --> 40:56.737
<i># Like Blind Willie Mc Tell #</i>

41:16.037 --> 41:18.230
<i>I remember, uh,</i>

41:18.304 --> 41:22.293
<i>Kennedy's funeral was on TV,
and we were sitting outside.</i>

41:22.371 --> 41:23.632
You could hear it.

41:23.704 --> 41:26.568
I was pulling up
chunks of grass with my fist

41:26.638 --> 41:29.332
and feeling like we were splitting apart.

41:29.405 --> 41:31.962
And... And, yeah, I asked him

41:32.038 --> 41:34.093
what did he think
made us so different?

41:34.170 --> 41:37.103
And he said it was simple.

41:37.171 --> 41:39.694
You know, I thought
that I could change things,

41:39.771 --> 41:41.361
and he knew that no one could.

41:41.437 --> 41:43.836
You know, look at Kennedy.

41:46.404 --> 41:50.393
<i>Then there was the fiasco
at the Civil Liberties Union,</i>

41:50.471 --> 41:52.494
<i>where Jack received
the Civil Rights Award</i>

41:52.571 --> 41:56.094
<i>and drank three vats of wine
for the trouble.</i>

41:56.171 --> 41:57.431
Thank you.

41:57.503 --> 41:59.469
I wanna accept this
on behalf of, uh,

41:59.537 --> 42:02.197
everybody that
went down to Cuba.

42:03.805 --> 42:06.669
First of all,
because you're all young, you know?

42:06.737 --> 42:08.499
And it's took me
a long time to get young,

42:08.571 --> 42:11.560
and now I consider myself young.

42:11.638 --> 42:14.695
And I'm proud of it.

42:14.770 --> 42:17.293
It ain't old people's world out there.

42:17.371 --> 42:21.427
I mean, you all
shouldn't even be here.

42:24.471 --> 42:27.631
I mean... it's not like before.

42:27.704 --> 42:29.330
There's no black or white,

42:29.404 --> 42:31.836
no more left wing,
right wing, you know?

42:31.905 --> 42:34.836
There's up wing
and there's down wing,

42:34.904 --> 42:36.302
which is why I think that, you know,

42:36.371 --> 42:40.701
this man who shot President Kennedy,

42:40.770 --> 42:43.828
this Lee Oswald,

42:43.905 --> 42:49.838
I think I saw something
that... that he felt... in me.

42:53.271 --> 42:55.998
Hey, but I'm just saying...

42:56.070 --> 42:59.332
You can boo, but booing's
got nothing to do with it!

42:59.403 --> 43:00.994
<i>They didn't understand me,
you know,</i>

43:01.070 --> 43:02.593
because they got mind blinders on.

43:02.671 --> 43:03.694
All they see is the cause

43:03.771 --> 43:05.237
and how they use people
for their cause.

43:05.305 --> 43:06.894
And now they're trying
to use me for something.

43:06.971 --> 43:08.960
The want me to... want me
to carry a picket sign

43:09.038 --> 43:12.470
and have my picture taken,

43:12.538 --> 43:14.265
be a good little nigger, you know,

43:14.337 --> 43:16.326
and not mess up their little game.

43:16.404 --> 43:20.336
All they want from me
is finger-pointing songs.

43:20.404 --> 43:22.801
I only got ten fingers.

43:22.870 --> 43:24.666
<i>Anybody who lent that kid a dime</i>

43:24.737 --> 43:27.330
<i>was sitting in that room that night.</i>

43:27.404 --> 43:30.461
<i>A week later, he issued
a formal apology.</i>

43:30.538 --> 43:32.470
<i>It's a fierce, heavy feeling,</i>

43:32.538 --> 43:34.561
<i>thinking that something's expected of you,</i>

43:34.638 --> 43:38.865
<i>but you don't know exactly what it is.</i>

43:38.937 --> 43:42.426
<i>Brings forth a weird kind of guilt.</i>

43:57.871 --> 44:01.303
<i>Woody Guthrie was dead.</i>

44:01.370 --> 44:03.929
<i>Little Richard
was becoming a preacher.</i>

44:04.005 --> 44:07.960
<i>So, whether you were
a folk singer or a Christian,</i>

44:08.037 --> 44:10.196
<i>rock and roll was the devil.</i>

44:13.670 --> 44:15.829
<i>Me, I was in a ditch, up a cliff,</i>

44:15.904 --> 44:18.097
<i>out of step, ready to quit.</i>

44:20.237 --> 44:22.896
I wrote the kind of stuff
you write when you have no place to live

44:22.970 --> 44:24.833
and you're wrapped up
in the fire pump.

44:28.504 --> 44:32.163
<i>I nearly killed myself
with pity and despair.</i>

44:34.703 --> 44:36.329
<i>And then I wrote it.</i>

44:38.104 --> 44:41.264
<i>It was like swimming in lava.</i>

44:41.336 --> 44:44.531
<i>Skipping, kicking,</i>

44:44.604 --> 44:48.434
<i>catching a nail with your foot,</i>

44:48.504 --> 44:51.698
<i>seeing your victim
hanging from a tree.</i>

44:59.137 --> 45:02.262
The person who's coming out now

45:02.337 --> 45:05.633
is a person who has, in a sense,

45:05.704 --> 45:09.034
changed the face
of American folk music...

45:15.670 --> 45:17.465
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:17.537 --> 45:18.901
the person
who's coming out now...

45:20.970 --> 45:23.402
...is a legend in his time.

45:23.471 --> 45:26.494
And his name is Jude Quinn!

45:36.204 --> 45:41.068
# Well, I try my best
to be just like I am #

45:41.137 --> 45:44.762
# But everybody wants you
to be just like them #

45:44.837 --> 45:48.793
# They say sing while you slave
but I just get bored #

45:48.871 --> 45:53.427
# Well, I ain't gonna work
on Maggie's farm no more #

46:00.471 --> 46:02.096
I want that volume down now!

46:02.171 --> 46:03.398
I can't turn the volume down!

46:03.471 --> 46:04.936
- I can't even hear the words!
- Hey, man...

46:05.004 --> 46:06.493
Hey what's wrong?

46:06.571 --> 46:07.832
Man, what are you going to do?

46:07.905 --> 46:09.132
What are you going to do up there?

46:09.205 --> 46:11.965
I'm going to cut
the goddamn... lead!

46:45.905 --> 46:47.666
Sorry for everything I've done,

46:47.738 --> 46:50.761
and, uh, I hope
to remedy it soon.

46:50.838 --> 46:51.962
- Shit!
- Crap!

46:52.037 --> 46:53.502
<i>Garbage! J'accuse!</i>

46:53.570 --> 46:56.128
Ah, it's just like
he's trying to conform

46:56.204 --> 46:58.829
to some sort of popular taste

46:58.904 --> 47:01.769
with this incredibly
corny group behind him,

47:01.838 --> 47:05.793
but he's just... he's just prostituting himself.

47:05.871 --> 47:08.928
He's... He's just
changed completely.

47:09.005 --> 47:11.664
He's changed from what he was.

47:11.738 --> 47:14.363
He's not the same
as he was at first.

47:14.438 --> 47:16.596
Nothing but a fake neurotic

47:16.670 --> 47:17.898
crawling through the gutter.

47:17.970 --> 47:19.766
If that is the way
he walks through a gutter,

47:19.838 --> 47:22.769
I would rather walk with my head up
through a gutter than like him,

47:22.837 --> 47:24.303
crawling through the bloody gutter,

47:24.371 --> 47:25.667
just making a pile out of it!

47:25.738 --> 47:27.136
That's what he is doing!

47:27.205 --> 47:30.034
He is just making a pile out of it!

47:30.104 --> 47:33.866
I kinda liked getting
blasted out of my skin.

47:35.004 --> 47:37.663
I think he's evil.

47:37.738 --> 47:40.260
And we were his biggest fans.

47:50.171 --> 47:53.728
<i># You've got a lot of nerve #</i>

47:53.804 --> 47:58.499
<i># To say you are my friend #</i>

47:58.570 --> 48:00.593
<i># When I was down #</i>

48:00.670 --> 48:05.330
<i># You just stood there grinning #</i>

48:07.904 --> 48:10.928
<i># You've got a lot of nerve #</i>

48:11.005 --> 48:15.959
<i># To say you got
a helping hand to lend #</i>

48:16.037 --> 48:18.333
<i># You just want to be #</i>

48:18.404 --> 48:22.768
<i># On the side that's winning #</i>

48:22.837 --> 48:24.531
It's not folk, it's not rock,

48:24.603 --> 48:26.365
but a brand-new way
of telling it like it is.

48:26.438 --> 48:28.529
And Jude Quinn is definitely what's happening.

48:28.604 --> 48:29.797
Here he comes now.

48:29.871 --> 48:31.132
Mr. Quinn! Mr. Quinn!

48:31.205 --> 48:32.999
Have you got a word
for your fans?

48:33.070 --> 48:34.660
Uh, astronaut.

48:34.737 --> 48:37.567
<i># What a drag it is #</i>

48:37.637 --> 48:41.899
<i># To see you #</i>

48:50.237 --> 48:51.930
- Mr. Quinn!
- Mr. Quinn!

48:52.004 --> 48:54.527
- Over here!
- Mr. Quinn!

48:54.603 --> 48:55.694
- Yes?
- Look over here, Jude!

48:55.770 --> 48:56.701
Thank you.

48:56.770 --> 48:58.031
Why do you think you were booed

48:58.104 --> 49:00.535
at your recent appearance
in New England?

49:00.603 --> 49:04.331
Well, um, I f...

49:04.404 --> 49:07.098
I figure there's
a little boo in all of us.

49:07.172 --> 49:08.262
- Jude!
- Mr. Quinn, Mr. Quinn!

49:08.337 --> 49:10.132
Is it true you no longer
sing protest songs?

49:10.204 --> 49:11.465
Who said that?

49:11.538 --> 49:12.469
I didn't say that.

49:12.537 --> 49:16.402
I was just, uh... I read somewhere
that you no longer do the protesting.

49:17.838 --> 49:22.792
Well, that's all I ever do is protest.

49:22.870 --> 49:24.631
Do you have a message?

49:25.805 --> 49:27.135
Do you?

49:27.204 --> 49:29.171
I mean, are you trying
to accomplish anything?

49:29.237 --> 49:31.260
Am I trying to accomplish anything?

49:31.337 --> 49:33.495
Are you trying to change
the world or anything?

49:33.570 --> 49:35.866
What am I trying to change
the word, did you say? Is...

49:35.937 --> 49:39.391
You know, are you trying
to push your idealism to the people?

49:39.471 --> 49:41.801
- No.
- Excuse me, Mr. Quinn.

49:41.870 --> 49:43.564
Perhaps you could tell us...

49:43.638 --> 49:45.127
Do you have a match?

49:45.204 --> 49:48.170
...how many people who labor
in the same musical vineyards

49:48.237 --> 49:49.169
in which you toil...

49:49.237 --> 49:50.897
That's very pretty.

49:50.971 --> 49:53.333
How many would you say
are protest singers today?

49:53.403 --> 49:59.030
That is, people who protest
against the social state we live in?

49:59.104 --> 50:00.660
Uh, how many?

50:00.737 --> 50:03.136
Yes. Are there many?

50:03.204 --> 50:06.762
Yeah, um...

50:06.838 --> 50:10.167
I-I think there's about 136.

50:10.237 --> 50:13.225
<i>Mr. Quinn, Keenan Jones
from Culture Beat.</i>

50:13.303 --> 50:18.100
As someone symbolic of the protest
movement among young people,

50:18.171 --> 50:20.399
some have questioned,
given your latest recordings,

50:20.471 --> 50:23.494
whether or not you still care
about people as you once did.

50:24.603 --> 50:27.729
Yeah, but, you know,

50:27.805 --> 50:30.828
we all have our own definitions
of all those words.

50:30.905 --> 50:35.199
"Care" and "people..."

50:35.270 --> 50:37.828
Well, I think we all know
the definition of people.

50:37.904 --> 50:40.302
Yeah.

50:40.371 --> 50:42.166
Do we?

50:42.237 --> 50:43.827
Well, is it your belief,
then, that folk music

50:43.904 --> 50:46.962
has, perchance, failed to achieve
its goals with the Negro cause

50:47.038 --> 50:48.628
or the cause of peace?

50:48.704 --> 50:52.101
You know, saying "cause of peace"

50:52.171 --> 50:56.103
is just like saying...
like a hunk of butter.

50:56.171 --> 50:58.568
You know, I don't know
how you can listen to anybody

50:58.637 --> 51:00.865
who wants you to believe
is dedicated to the hunk

51:00.937 --> 51:02.130
and not the butter.

51:02.204 --> 51:03.931
I'm not sure I follow.

51:04.004 --> 51:09.028
You know, I didn't come
out of some cereal box.

51:09.105 --> 51:10.764
There's... There's no one out there

51:10.838 --> 51:12.496
who's ever going to be
converted by a song.

51:12.570 --> 51:16.900
There's no Phil Ochs song
that's going to keep

51:16.970 --> 51:20.425
a movement moving
nor the picket line picketing.

51:20.503 --> 51:23.470
His songs are acts
of personal conscience,

51:23.538 --> 51:27.436
like burning a draft card
or burning yourself.

51:27.504 --> 51:31.300
Doesn't do a damn thing
except disassociate you

51:31.371 --> 51:34.064
and your audience from
all the evils of the world.

51:34.137 --> 51:37.466
I refuse to be
disassociated from that.

51:39.738 --> 51:41.965
All these people, you know,

51:42.037 --> 51:43.900
sitting around being offended
by their own meaninglessness.

51:43.970 --> 51:45.129
What am I asking?

51:45.204 --> 51:47.931
I'm asking for your
goddamn hotel security

51:48.004 --> 51:49.493
to keep these assholes out of the lobby.

51:49.571 --> 51:52.559
What? What?

51:52.637 --> 51:56.001
And you, sir, are one of the dumbest assholes
and most stupid persons

51:56.070 --> 51:58.434
I've ever spoken to
in my life, understand?

51:58.503 --> 52:00.163
What?

52:00.237 --> 52:02.135
Well, I certainly hope so.

52:02.204 --> 52:03.897
Son of a bitch English bastard.

52:03.970 --> 52:05.163
Meaningless is right.

52:05.237 --> 52:07.328
Do you think the average cat
who works eight hours a day

52:07.404 --> 52:10.097
gives a tit what I do?

52:10.171 --> 52:12.966
Anyway, it's not going
to keep me in heaven

52:13.037 --> 52:16.265
or out of the fiery furnace, that's for sure.

52:16.337 --> 52:17.962
Not gonna make me happy.

52:18.037 --> 52:19.798
Let me see that.

52:24.637 --> 52:26.900
Whoa, there she is again,
your little debutante.

52:26.971 --> 52:28.834
No way, man.

52:28.905 --> 52:31.768
Is that Andy's new bird?
Coco something?

52:31.837 --> 52:32.962
Rivington.

52:33.037 --> 52:36.969
Coco Rivington Rockefeller,
Mrs. Howell III.

52:37.037 --> 52:40.367
She's queen of the underground,
and I don't mean tube.

52:40.437 --> 52:43.734
She's got good style.

52:43.804 --> 52:45.963
- I'd ball her.
- Be my guest.

52:46.037 --> 52:48.936
I think she's even here in, uh, London.

52:49.005 --> 52:50.630
She's here?

52:50.704 --> 52:51.999
So you dated her, did you?

52:52.070 --> 52:54.332
Never. That girl's trouble.

52:54.404 --> 52:56.063
Will you invite her to the party?

52:56.137 --> 52:58.898
Sure. I always invite trouble.

53:21.571 --> 53:24.901
<i># I'm beginning to hear voices #</i>

53:29.538 --> 53:32.265
<i># And there's no one around #</i>

53:37.503 --> 53:40.334
<i># Well, I'm all used up #</i>

53:42.171 --> 53:43.727
<i># Yeah #</i>

53:45.837 --> 53:48.429
<i># And the fields
have turned brown #</i>

53:50.571 --> 53:52.536
Hold on a sec. There's someone at the door.

53:52.603 --> 53:53.864
If it's that fucking concierge again,

53:53.937 --> 53:54.925
I swear to God...

53:55.004 --> 53:57.765
Yeah, who is it?

53:57.837 --> 53:59.132
They're going to have to come up

53:59.203 --> 54:01.534
with some different numbers
if they want this to work.

54:01.604 --> 54:03.365
No. Stu...

54:03.438 --> 54:05.733
I'm not going to talk
about this all goddamn day.

54:05.804 --> 54:07.703
"Puffing heavily on his cigarette,

54:07.770 --> 54:09.100
he smokes 80 a day."

54:09.171 --> 54:10.762
Sinatra wants it.

54:10.838 --> 54:14.667
God. I'm glad I'm not me.

54:14.737 --> 54:16.999
Hey! I've got something to say to you.

54:17.069 --> 54:19.194
- Whoa!
- Hey, fuck off!

54:19.270 --> 54:20.861
- It's him I'm talkin' at.
- Yeah, I'm listenin', man.

54:20.937 --> 54:23.199
- Traitor! You wanker!
- Listen, pal.

54:23.271 --> 54:25.601
If you know what's good for you, you'll turn
right around and get the fuck out of here.

54:25.671 --> 54:28.193
Come on. Hey!

54:28.271 --> 54:29.498
Hurry up.

54:29.571 --> 54:32.264
Jason! You got to get in here, man.
You better hurry.

54:32.337 --> 54:35.268
- It's your boy I want.
- Put that knife down. You hear me?

54:36.271 --> 54:38.100
- Hey, man.
- Jesus Christ.

54:38.171 --> 54:40.864
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
What are you gonna do? Stab us all?

54:40.937 --> 54:43.335
It's his fault! He's the one.

54:43.404 --> 54:44.596
Stabbing truth in the eye.

54:44.670 --> 54:46.296
I'm listening.
What's the truth, man?

54:46.370 --> 54:49.030
Easy, easy, easy.
Now just put that down...

54:49.104 --> 54:50.900
No! Walk away.

54:50.971 --> 54:53.162
- Just relax.
- Hey, back up.

54:53.236 --> 54:54.827
Either be groovy or leave, man.

55:02.570 --> 55:03.900
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

55:03.970 --> 55:05.368
Everybody all right?

55:05.438 --> 55:08.802
- Thanks for steppin' in.
- My pleasure.

55:08.871 --> 55:11.496
Just like a woman.

55:37.837 --> 55:41.201
<i># They sat together in the park #</i>

55:41.271 --> 55:44.726
<i># As the evening sky grew dark #</i>

55:44.805 --> 55:47.998
<i># She looked at him
and he felt a spark #</i>

55:48.070 --> 55:51.002
<i># Tingle to his bones #</i>

55:52.104 --> 55:54.535
<i># 'Twas then he felt alone #</i>

55:54.603 --> 55:58.797
<i># And wished that he'd gone straight #</i>

55:58.870 --> 56:02.768
<i># And watched out
for a simple twist of fate #</i>

56:06.237 --> 56:09.760
<i># They walked along
by the old canal #</i>

56:09.837 --> 56:12.303
<i># A little confused, I remember well #</i>

56:12.370 --> 56:14.495
Claire! Claire, honey,
you got to meet someone.

56:14.570 --> 56:17.365
Hang on a second. Am I shitting you?

56:17.438 --> 56:20.835
- Dirty son of a gun.
- Claire, this is Sidney Green.

56:20.904 --> 56:22.870
A very bad old friend of mine.

56:22.938 --> 56:24.425
Hello.

56:24.503 --> 56:26.231
She's a doll. Actress.

56:26.303 --> 56:28.862
Uh, no, a painter. She's unbelievable.

56:28.938 --> 56:30.268
And Sid's a collector.

56:30.337 --> 56:32.302
What do you paint, honey?

56:32.370 --> 56:35.700
Oh, they're... They're abstracts,

56:35.770 --> 56:37.736
- most of what I do.
- She's French?

56:37.804 --> 56:40.236
Aw, for cryin' out loud.

56:40.303 --> 56:43.395
Oh, oh. It's Mailer.

56:43.471 --> 56:46.096
Norman Mailer?

56:49.237 --> 56:51.396
Abstracts, huh?

56:59.003 --> 57:02.492
<i># People tell me it's a sin #</i>

57:02.570 --> 57:05.798
<i># To know and feel too much within #</i>

57:05.870 --> 57:09.030
<i># I still believe she was my twin #</i>

57:09.104 --> 57:11.797
<i># But I lost the ring #</i>

57:11.870 --> 57:15.393
<i># She was born in the spring #</i>

57:15.470 --> 57:19.426
<i># But I was born too late #</i>

57:19.504 --> 57:23.197
<i># Blame it on a simple twist of fate #</i>

57:36.037 --> 57:40.264
Silence, experience shows,

57:40.362 --> 57:44.056
is what terrifies people most.

58:01.863 --> 58:04.056
If he said he'll be here, he'll be here.

58:04.130 --> 58:06.824
It's just such a terribly important booking.

58:06.897 --> 58:08.453
Keenan seldom interviews.

58:08.530 --> 58:10.052
He's really more of
an opinion maker really,

58:10.131 --> 58:13.652
on the telly, so, there's
apt to be no time at all.

58:13.728 --> 58:16.354
Is there a handler?
Someone who looks after him?

58:16.429 --> 58:19.156
I told you, he and John
and Paul and George...

58:19.230 --> 58:22.196
Yes, but did he ever get back?

58:22.262 --> 58:24.126
- Pardon me.
- What?

58:24.196 --> 58:26.719
Do you know if Jude
Quinn is in attendance?

58:26.797 --> 58:27.819
The country-western singer?

58:27.896 --> 58:30.294
No time for autographs, dearie.

58:31.729 --> 58:33.991
- What's that over there?
- Where?

58:37.929 --> 58:39.827
Do the Watusi, John!

58:42.529 --> 58:45.654
Whoa!

58:45.729 --> 58:47.286
Mr. Quinn?

58:47.363 --> 58:49.226
Mr. Quinn, yoo-hoo.

58:50.996 --> 58:54.860
Yes, Mr. Quinn, hello!
We're all just here at the car. No worries.

58:55.863 --> 58:58.658
Good. Sayonara.

59:05.396 --> 59:06.657
Mother. Mother.

59:06.730 --> 59:08.719
Oh, Mr. Quinn! What a privilege

59:08.797 --> 59:10.353
to have in our midst...

59:10.430 --> 59:14.418
...a true visionary, and such a splendid
example to the youth.

59:14.496 --> 59:18.020
And such marvelous songs.
So truly wonderful.

59:18.096 --> 59:19.392
- Howdy.
- Our dear friend,

59:19.463 --> 59:21.486
Carolyn Hester, the folk singer?

59:21.562 --> 59:23.994
She was saying,
just the other day, how liberating

59:24.063 --> 59:26.791
what you're doing really is
for all... Mr. Quinn, hello!

59:26.864 --> 59:28.988
Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry.

59:29.063 --> 59:31.893
Carolyn said that? You tell Carolyn
to come see me anytime,

59:31.963 --> 59:33.861
now that she's, uh, liberated.

59:33.929 --> 59:36.951
Jude, you know, like in the song
"Generation Dungeon,"

59:37.028 --> 59:38.891
when you say "he has the eyes of a camel

59:38.962 --> 59:41.622
- and sleeps on a hook..." That's Victor, right?
- Mr. Quinn!

59:41.696 --> 59:44.992
'Cause I saw a picture of him once
in a magazine, smoking Camels,

59:45.063 --> 59:46.859
which I know
Danny Ronk used to smoke,

59:46.929 --> 59:48.862
but then he switched
to Lucky Strikes in '64.

59:48.929 --> 59:51.554
Mr. Quinn, we really ought to hurry.
Everyone's at the car!

59:51.629 --> 59:53.117
<i>...till early '65.
- Norman, Mona, Sammy...</i>

59:53.195 --> 59:55.787
Sammy? Who's Sammy?

59:55.863 --> 59:58.351
Sonny. Sonny Dover.

59:58.429 --> 1:00:00.486
The central doyen of the inner circle,

1:00:00.562 --> 1:00:02.619
and Jude's oldest ally.

1:00:02.696 --> 1:00:04.992
He plays maracas
on "Medicine Sunday."

1:00:05.063 --> 1:00:07.722
Judey! Lover boy! Ah!

1:00:07.796 --> 1:00:12.353
Two words on Shakespeare,
Mr. Quinn, for our listeners.

1:00:12.429 --> 1:00:14.486
Two words?

1:00:14.562 --> 1:00:16.357
Raving queen,

1:00:16.429 --> 1:00:18.622
and cosmic amphetamine brain.

1:00:18.696 --> 1:00:20.888
I dig Shakespeare.

1:00:20.963 --> 1:00:22.292
I have a question for Mr. Quinn.

1:00:22.362 --> 1:00:24.294
Oh, Keenan, please
forgive us. Mr. Quinn,

1:00:24.362 --> 1:00:26.591
allow me to introduce to you
Mr. Keenan Jones,

1:00:26.663 --> 1:00:28.629
arts editor and host of the BBC.

1:00:28.697 --> 1:00:29.821
I remember you.

1:00:29.896 --> 1:00:32.191
Yes, I was going to ask
Mr. Quinn why he insists

1:00:32.262 --> 1:00:35.717
on putting us and the rest
of the world on so?

1:00:35.796 --> 1:00:38.387
Some might be persuaded
to doubt his sincerity.

1:00:38.462 --> 1:00:41.690
Well, who said I was sincere?

1:00:41.762 --> 1:00:45.126
Are you saying you're not sincere?

1:00:45.196 --> 1:00:48.094
No more than you, you know?

1:00:48.163 --> 1:00:49.719
No more sincere than you are.

1:00:51.596 --> 1:00:55.528
See, you just want me to say
what you want me to say.

1:01:02.829 --> 1:01:04.192
You might think

1:01:04.262 --> 1:01:06.491
nothing can reach
those tens of thousands,

1:01:06.563 --> 1:01:09.085
living by the dollar.

1:01:11.396 --> 1:01:13.452
But you'd be wrong.

1:01:19.496 --> 1:01:23.293
Hey. What are you doin' here?

1:01:26.563 --> 1:01:28.892
You alone?

1:01:28.963 --> 1:01:32.020
Now, why would that be
any concern of yours?

1:01:32.096 --> 1:01:36.051
Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

1:01:36.130 --> 1:01:38.993
- Nothing happened.
- Fine. Nothing happened.

1:01:40.828 --> 1:01:43.727
Oh, come on.
I was straight with you.

1:01:43.796 --> 1:01:46.092
I thought you had no recollection.

1:01:46.162 --> 1:01:50.289
Look, I can't recall
San Francisco at all.

1:01:50.363 --> 1:01:52.260
And I can't really
remember El Paso,

1:01:52.329 --> 1:01:54.625
but you shouldn't take
it all so personal.

1:01:54.696 --> 1:01:57.424
I don't, believe me.

1:01:57.496 --> 1:02:00.859
My current situation far precedes
anything from the past.

1:02:02.096 --> 1:02:04.619
But you never know how
the past will turn out.

1:02:04.697 --> 1:02:07.128
Sorry.

1:02:07.196 --> 1:02:09.321
But your kisses are nothing like his.

1:02:09.396 --> 1:02:11.259
I bet.

1:02:11.330 --> 1:02:14.454
- Anyone I know?
- Good one.

1:02:14.529 --> 1:02:18.053
No, your lucky tongue will not decay me.

1:02:18.129 --> 1:02:20.652
Fine, you take your glands,
and your medallions,

1:02:20.729 --> 1:02:22.888
and make love for once, freely.

1:02:22.963 --> 1:02:26.088
So that's what you think
you have over everyone.

1:02:26.162 --> 1:02:31.152
Freedom.

1:02:33.528 --> 1:02:36.324
I just got to clean up a little bit.

1:02:38.295 --> 1:02:39.921
And I'll be fine.

1:02:39.996 --> 1:02:42.553
Here's a tip: Use your fists.

1:02:43.562 --> 1:02:45.528
Very funny, Coco.

1:02:49.196 --> 1:02:51.991
Hey, Coco!

1:02:52.063 --> 1:02:55.051
Coco!

1:03:02.029 --> 1:03:04.495
You look and sound very tired, very ill.

1:03:04.563 --> 1:03:06.187
Is this your normal state?

1:03:06.262 --> 1:03:08.024
I take that as an insult.

1:03:08.096 --> 1:03:12.619
Do you suffer from sore eyes,
groovy foreheads, and curly hair?

1:03:12.696 --> 1:03:14.628
Take Zoomdom!

1:03:14.696 --> 1:03:19.095
Hey. Hey, isn't that
what's-his-name, the poet?

1:03:19.163 --> 1:03:21.958
- Ginsberg?
- Allen Ginsberg?

1:03:22.029 --> 1:03:24.290
Oh, my God! It is!

1:03:25.462 --> 1:03:27.019
Wait a minute.

1:03:33.863 --> 1:03:36.693
Hey! Allen thought
that was you in there!

1:03:36.761 --> 1:03:38.954
I don't think you two have met.

1:03:39.029 --> 1:03:42.517
- Hi.
- Hey.

1:03:42.596 --> 1:03:44.425
Allen, tell him what you said to that reporter,

1:03:44.497 --> 1:03:47.190
the one that asked
if you thought that Jude had sold out.

1:03:47.263 --> 1:03:48.593
<i>What, they're asking you?</i>

1:03:48.663 --> 1:03:53.253
I said I didn't know.
Perhaps you sold out to God.

1:03:53.329 --> 1:03:56.761
What's that even mean?

1:03:56.828 --> 1:03:59.989
Well, if your mission
was to see whether

1:04:00.063 --> 1:04:02.756
you could do great art on a juke box,

1:04:02.829 --> 1:04:04.761
well, you know, then we all benefited.

1:04:04.829 --> 1:04:09.159
Profited, you said, by his coercion.

1:04:09.230 --> 1:04:13.184
That was it. So. What now?

1:04:13.262 --> 1:04:16.887
Now? What's left?

1:04:16.962 --> 1:04:20.690
Oh, my salvation?

1:04:20.761 --> 1:04:23.853
Well, see what we could do.

1:04:29.964 --> 1:04:32.121
Oh, he'll give it to you!

1:04:34.529 --> 1:04:38.393
That was Allen Ginsberg, man!

1:04:38.462 --> 1:04:41.758
See ya later, Allen Ginsberg.

1:04:44.295 --> 1:04:45.761
Would you say, then,

1:04:45.829 --> 1:04:46.795
that the collective struggles

1:04:46.863 --> 1:04:49.125
of the color discrimination
or the war have failed,

1:04:49.196 --> 1:04:51.253
or as I believe you inferred earlier,

1:04:51.330 --> 1:04:53.352
do you think it's the process
itself that's at fault?

1:04:53.428 --> 1:04:57.156
Who cares what I think?
I'm not the president.

1:04:57.230 --> 1:05:00.593
I'm not some shepherd.
I'm just a storyteller, man.

1:05:00.662 --> 1:05:02.924
- It's all I am.
- Well, certainly.

1:05:02.996 --> 1:05:05.427
But as someone
who once cared deeply,

1:05:05.496 --> 1:05:08.395
as a storyteller, as...

1:05:08.463 --> 1:05:12.292
for social justice, equality...
certainly you still care as a human being.

1:05:14.062 --> 1:05:17.495
Well, why? Why?

1:05:19.429 --> 1:05:21.020
I mean, what do you care?

1:05:21.096 --> 1:05:24.061
If I care, or I don't care, what's it to you?

1:05:25.796 --> 1:05:29.285
All right, what if I said
I never cared about, you know, folk music?

1:05:29.362 --> 1:05:31.261
About, you know, protest songs?

1:05:31.330 --> 1:05:33.158
It was all about jumping into a scene.

1:05:35.262 --> 1:05:38.785
You know, I was never
gonna stay there. I mean, I just...

1:05:38.862 --> 1:05:41.693
I knew I could do it
better than anybody else.

1:05:41.762 --> 1:05:43.728
Well, I don't believe you.

1:05:43.796 --> 1:05:46.193
No, I mean, you know,
what matters to me...

1:05:46.263 --> 1:05:48.854
you know, it matters
what's happening now.

1:05:48.929 --> 1:05:51.327
Does it matter to you when
songs you're writing now

1:05:51.395 --> 1:05:53.417
are being used as recruitment tools

1:05:53.495 --> 1:05:56.326
for militant street gangs,
like the all-Negro faction in the United States?

1:05:56.395 --> 1:05:57.418
Oh, yeah.

1:05:57.496 --> 1:05:59.190
A group that promotes precisely
the kind of violence

1:05:59.263 --> 1:06:00.727
your earlier songs oppose?

1:06:00.796 --> 1:06:03.262
If you're asking me, man, am I a member
of the Black Panther Party,

1:06:03.330 --> 1:06:06.319
the answer's no.

1:06:08.396 --> 1:06:12.191
Man, I can't really tell you how I care.

1:06:12.262 --> 1:06:14.160
Well, I presume at the very least

1:06:14.229 --> 1:06:17.753
that you care something
about what you sing every night.

1:06:17.829 --> 1:06:21.159
What are you...
How can I answer that,

1:06:21.230 --> 1:06:23.889
if you got the nerve to ask me?

1:06:23.963 --> 1:06:26.758
I mean, you've got a lot of nerve,
asking me a question like that.

1:06:26.829 --> 1:06:29.590
- Do you ask the Beatles that?
- Do I...

1:06:29.662 --> 1:06:32.457
- Or Mr. Eve of Destruction?
- Would you ask Barry McGuire that?

1:06:32.529 --> 1:06:35.154
I have to ask, because you have the nerve
to question whether I care.

1:06:35.229 --> 1:06:37.422
I'm not questioning you because I don't
expect any answers from you.

1:06:37.496 --> 1:06:39.519
Maybe Victor Mature.
He looks like Victor Mature.

1:06:39.596 --> 1:06:42.756
More like Elsa Lanchester,
man, with a North Mexican kind of thing.

1:06:42.829 --> 1:06:45.351
That's very protest-y, man.
You know, it's very very protest-y.

1:06:45.429 --> 1:06:48.759
You know, I am convinced of one thing.
You either do care about nothing at all,

1:06:48.829 --> 1:06:50.920
or tremendously much
that people think so.

1:06:51.063 --> 1:06:54.085
And you ask for my time?

1:06:55.896 --> 1:06:58.361
Mr. Quinn, we really do need you in...

1:06:58.429 --> 1:07:01.986
Listen, I know more about you, right,
than you will ever know about me.

1:07:02.062 --> 1:07:05.188
You think I give a crumpet
what you write in your lousy paper?

1:07:05.263 --> 1:07:08.127
Now, I don't need to look to someone else,
man, to tell me I'm good.

1:07:08.196 --> 1:07:10.287
Slaughter me, for all I care.

1:07:10.363 --> 1:07:11.987
I refuse to be hurt.

1:07:12.062 --> 1:07:14.051
Mr. Quinn, we really
do need you in the car.

1:07:14.129 --> 1:07:15.425
Hey, man.

1:07:15.496 --> 1:07:17.689
You refuse feeling deeply about anything.

1:07:17.762 --> 1:07:20.592
It's clear to anyone
how entirely self-conscious you are,

1:07:20.661 --> 1:07:22.059
in everything you do.

1:07:22.129 --> 1:07:23.959
- That's enough!
- Feeling deeply?

1:07:24.028 --> 1:07:26.688
That's what this is about?

1:07:26.762 --> 1:07:30.126
What precisely, please do tell,
am I supposed to be feeling, huh?

1:07:30.196 --> 1:07:32.457
I'm simply referring
to standard emotions:

1:07:32.529 --> 1:07:35.723
Pain, remorse, love.

1:07:35.796 --> 1:07:38.626
Yeah, I have none of those feelings.

1:08:22.129 --> 1:08:24.960
<i># You walk into the room #</i>

1:08:25.029 --> 1:08:28.859
<i># With a pencil in your hand #</i>

1:08:28.929 --> 1:08:32.621
<i># You see somebody naked
and you say #</i>

1:08:32.695 --> 1:08:35.423
<i># "Who is that man?" #</i>

1:08:35.496 --> 1:08:38.257
<i># You try so hard #</i>

1:08:38.329 --> 1:08:41.954
<i># But you don't understand #</i>

1:08:42.028 --> 1:08:46.791
<i># Just what you will say
when you get home #</i>

1:08:48.662 --> 1:08:52.253
# But there's something
happening here #

1:08:52.329 --> 1:08:55.954
# And you don't know what it is #

1:08:56.028 --> 1:09:00.324
# Do you, Mr. Jones? #

1:09:06.696 --> 1:09:10.288
<i># So you hand in your ticket #</i>

1:09:10.363 --> 1:09:14.158
<i># And you go watch the geek #</i>

1:09:14.229 --> 1:09:16.320
<i># Who immediately walks up to you #</i>

1:09:16.395 --> 1:09:19.123
<i># When he hears you speak #</i>

1:09:19.196 --> 1:09:20.786
<i># And he says #</i>

1:09:20.863 --> 1:09:23.351
<i># "Well, how does it feel, my friend #</i>

1:09:23.429 --> 1:09:26.759
<i># To be such a freak?" #</i>

1:09:26.829 --> 1:09:29.386
<i># You say, "Impossiblel" #</i>

1:09:29.462 --> 1:09:33.588
<i># As he hands you a bone #</i>

1:09:33.662 --> 1:09:37.287
<i># And you're positive that
something's happening here #</i>

1:09:37.362 --> 1:09:39.828
<i># But you don't know what it is #</i>

1:09:39.896 --> 1:09:41.327
<i># Do you #</i>

1:09:43.029 --> 1:09:45.392
<i># Mr. Jones? #</i>

1:09:51.529 --> 1:09:54.722
# You have so many contacts #

1:09:54.795 --> 1:09:57.920
# Out there among the lumberjacks #

1:09:57.995 --> 1:10:00.655
<i># To get you the facts
when someone attacks #</i>

1:10:00.729 --> 1:10:03.388
<i># Your imagination #</i>

1:10:04.896 --> 1:10:08.090
# No one has any respect #

1:10:08.163 --> 1:10:10.493
# Anyway, they always expect #

1:10:10.562 --> 1:10:13.528
<i># You'll just give a check #</i>

1:10:13.596 --> 1:10:19.222
<i># To tax-deductible
charity organizations #</i>

1:10:22.195 --> 1:10:24.718
# Well #

1:10:24.796 --> 1:10:27.728
# You been with the professors #

1:10:27.796 --> 1:10:31.523
# And they all like your looks #

1:10:31.596 --> 1:10:34.720
# And with great lawyers you have #

1:10:34.795 --> 1:10:37.853
# Discussed lepers and crooks #

1:10:37.928 --> 1:10:41.054
# You've been through all of #

1:10:41.130 --> 1:10:44.426
# F. Scott Fitzgerald's books #

1:10:44.497 --> 1:10:48.929
# You're very well read,
yeah, it's well known #

1:10:50.696 --> 1:10:54.219
# Because something
is still happening here #

1:10:54.295 --> 1:10:56.954
# You don't know what it is #

1:10:57.029 --> 1:10:59.586
# Do you #

1:10:59.662 --> 1:11:02.253
# Mr. Jones? #

1:11:08.330 --> 1:11:11.352
<i># Well, the sword swallower #</i>

1:11:11.429 --> 1:11:15.020
<i># He comes up to you
and then he kneels #</i>

1:11:15.095 --> 1:11:18.152
<i># He crosses himself #</i>

1:11:18.229 --> 1:11:21.627
<i># And then he clicks his high heels #</i>

1:11:21.696 --> 1:11:24.356
<i># Without further notice #</i>

1:11:24.430 --> 1:11:27.089
<i># He tells you how it feels #</i>

1:11:27.163 --> 1:11:30.526
<i># Then he says,
"Here's your mouth back #</i>

1:11:30.596 --> 1:11:32.084
<i># Thanks for the loan" #</i>

1:11:32.162 --> 1:11:33.923
Stop. Stop the song.

1:11:33.995 --> 1:11:36.188
<i># And you kno... #</i>

1:11:36.262 --> 1:11:38.854
Well, I missed it. I missed it again.

1:11:38.929 --> 1:11:40.292
I missed it.

1:11:40.362 --> 1:11:41.589
Bobby, now you ain't hearin' me, man.

1:11:41.662 --> 1:11:43.957
No, we are the geeks. You dig?

1:11:44.028 --> 1:11:45.619
But then why is that cool?

1:11:45.696 --> 1:11:48.128
No, man, we are the ones
being paraded around

1:11:48.196 --> 1:11:50.025
like some sort of circus freaks.

1:11:50.096 --> 1:11:51.561
"Come on up and see Harlem,
Mr. Jones,

1:11:51.629 --> 1:11:53.686
but make sure your window's
rolled up tight."

1:11:53.762 --> 1:11:55.920
This song is hell, man.
You've got to understand,

1:11:55.995 --> 1:11:59.859
this song is saying
a hell of a lot about society.

1:11:59.928 --> 1:12:01.951
All power to all people,
man, that's what it's saying.

1:12:02.028 --> 1:12:03.289
- I missed it again.
- Bobby.

1:12:03.362 --> 1:12:05.158
Aw, Bobby nothing.
Just play it again, Huey.

1:12:05.229 --> 1:12:07.627
Let's play it one more time.

1:12:08.762 --> 1:12:11.751
# Because something
is happenin' here #

1:12:11.828 --> 1:12:14.953
# And you don't know what it is #

1:12:15.028 --> 1:12:17.926
# Do you #

1:12:17.995 --> 1:12:20.484
# Mr. Jones? #

1:12:40.762 --> 1:12:44.489
You know, this is music.

1:12:44.562 --> 1:12:48.494
You know, what you're hearing
is not English music, all right?

1:12:49.562 --> 1:12:51.255
You've never really heard
American music before.

1:12:52.995 --> 1:12:55.859
And what you hear, obviously, right now,
doesn't have a name.

1:12:55.928 --> 1:12:59.383
It's words, all right? And sounds.

1:12:59.462 --> 1:13:02.360
If it's something
you disagree with, that's great.

1:13:03.662 --> 1:13:05.628
Judas!

1:13:10.529 --> 1:13:13.051
I don't believe you.

1:13:13.128 --> 1:13:15.152
Judas!

1:13:18.262 --> 1:13:20.558
Come up here and say that.

1:13:22.729 --> 1:13:24.957
You're liars, all of you.

1:13:36.062 --> 1:13:39.290
I accept chaos.

1:13:42.496 --> 1:13:44.395
I'm not sure whether it accepts me.

1:13:52.528 --> 1:13:56.393
We hadn't spoken in a long while.

1:13:56.461 --> 1:14:01.088
I think he was involved
with someone, actually...

1:14:01.162 --> 1:14:02.924
He said something to me on the phone

1:14:02.996 --> 1:14:05.689
about angels hanging off of buildings,

1:14:05.762 --> 1:14:08.285
which was frightening.

1:14:08.363 --> 1:14:10.386
I thought he was hallucinating.

1:14:11.828 --> 1:14:14.689
That was the last I heard.

1:14:14.761 --> 1:14:19.285
It was like what people say
about Billy the Kid...

1:14:19.362 --> 1:14:21.987
that he really just dodged
a bullet and went into hiding.

1:14:23.596 --> 1:14:27.426
And Jack, he always
loved Billy the Kid.

1:14:27.496 --> 1:14:30.395
Whoo!

1:14:33.862 --> 1:14:35.828
Henry.

1:14:45.529 --> 1:14:47.085
What the hell's wrong with you?

1:14:51.362 --> 1:14:54.226
<i>Paper said Pat Garrett tracked me down.</i>

1:14:54.295 --> 1:14:56.124
<i>Stopped me dead.</i>

1:14:56.195 --> 1:14:59.491
<i>That outlaws always die.</i>

1:14:59.562 --> 1:15:02.393
<i>Only a fool would believe
what they read in the papers.</i>

1:15:03.928 --> 1:15:05.417
Come on.

1:15:13.962 --> 1:15:17.917
<i>Here, I'm invisible.</i>

1:15:19.496 --> 1:15:21.394
Come on, now.

1:15:27.696 --> 1:15:29.595
<i>Even to myself.</i>

1:15:55.895 --> 1:15:58.452
Henry! Calm yourself down.

1:15:58.528 --> 1:15:59.755
Gettin' everybody zigaboo here.

1:16:01.529 --> 1:16:03.324
Henry. Henry! Henry!

1:16:03.395 --> 1:16:06.260
Come on back here! Henry!

1:16:06.330 --> 1:16:08.319
You get back here!

1:16:09.663 --> 1:16:12.957
<i>And here, by the road
where nobody goes,</i>

1:16:13.028 --> 1:16:14.550
<i>where it causes no worry,</i>

1:16:14.628 --> 1:16:18.356
<i>where the show must go on,</i>

1:16:18.428 --> 1:16:20.394
<i>is where I'll die.</i>

1:16:34.862 --> 1:16:37.556
Henry! Come back here!

1:16:37.629 --> 1:16:39.856
Henry! Come back here!

1:17:37.661 --> 1:17:41.185
<i># There must be some kind
of way out of here #</i>

1:17:41.262 --> 1:17:45.092
<i># Said the joker to the thief #</i>

1:17:45.162 --> 1:17:48.754
<i># There's too much confusion #</i>

1:17:48.829 --> 1:17:52.817
<i># I can't get no relief #</i>

1:17:52.895 --> 1:17:55.555
<i># Two riders are approaching #</i>

1:17:55.629 --> 1:17:59.356
<i># And the wind began to howl #</i>

1:18:14.162 --> 1:18:16.753
Henry! Henry!

1:18:16.829 --> 1:18:18.453
God damn it, get back here!

1:18:18.528 --> 1:18:20.791
Hey! Come back, Henry!

1:18:20.863 --> 1:18:22.295
Come on, now.

1:18:25.129 --> 1:18:27.061
<i>How long had it been?</i>

1:18:27.129 --> 1:18:28.425
<i>I couldn't even say.</i>

1:18:30.662 --> 1:18:33.889
<i>The day I arrived looks a lot like today.</i>

1:18:37.429 --> 1:18:39.690
<i>Least, that's how it seemed at the time.</i>

1:19:05.529 --> 1:19:07.825
Homer, is that you?

1:19:07.896 --> 1:19:10.361
Mr. B.

1:19:14.328 --> 1:19:16.261
What's the trouble, there?

1:19:16.328 --> 1:19:18.521
A useless bag of thumbs what I am.

1:19:20.462 --> 1:19:23.155
There you go.

1:19:23.229 --> 1:19:26.320
Sellin' off whatnot.

1:19:26.395 --> 1:19:28.554
Mm-hmm.

1:19:28.629 --> 1:19:32.822
Well, ain't seen no
yellow dog runnin' loose

1:19:32.895 --> 1:19:34.554
by any chance, have you?

1:19:35.596 --> 1:19:37.494
Old Henry tore off on me.

1:19:37.562 --> 1:19:39.891
- What, she get spooked?
- Seemed to.

1:19:39.962 --> 1:19:41.723
Why? Critters know what's goin' on.

1:19:41.795 --> 1:19:44.921
- What do they know?
- Well, for one, they know

1:19:44.995 --> 1:19:46.825
Shadow Valley's gettin'
blown to kingdom come.

1:19:46.896 --> 1:19:51.453
What, that old highway plan?
No, never had a chance.

1:19:51.529 --> 1:19:53.687
You mean, you really ain't heard?

1:19:53.761 --> 1:19:56.125
Heard what?

1:19:56.195 --> 1:19:59.127
Mr. B, that plan's official.
It's gone through.

1:19:59.195 --> 1:20:01.423
Last Tuesday, they all come.
Old Man Garrett and them bunch?

1:20:01.496 --> 1:20:02.961
Wavin' all sorts of papers?

1:20:03.028 --> 1:20:04.960
- I never seen such a stupor.
- What are you talkin' about?

1:20:05.028 --> 1:20:07.051
- Wh-What's official?
- Six-laner headed

1:20:07.129 --> 1:20:08.686
straight through
the heart of Shadow Valley.

1:20:08.762 --> 1:20:11.227
Commissioner Garrett done
give us 30 days come November.

1:20:11.295 --> 1:20:13.760
Why haven't I heard
nothing about this?

1:20:13.828 --> 1:20:16.521
Mr. B, you don't get out much.

1:20:16.595 --> 1:20:19.959
Don't sound credible to me, Homer.

1:20:21.928 --> 1:20:24.827
What have people been saying?
They been doin' anything?

1:20:24.896 --> 1:20:27.259
Well, first Charley Harper,
the zookeeper?

1:20:27.329 --> 1:20:29.727
Shot hisself in the face in front of them

1:20:29.796 --> 1:20:31.761
three maiden sisters
and two bachelor brothers.

1:20:31.828 --> 1:20:33.760
Them all went insane on account.

1:20:33.828 --> 1:20:35.623
Been five hangings, six Phenobarbitals,

1:20:35.695 --> 1:20:37.991
and, well...

1:20:38.062 --> 1:20:39.891
you familiar with young Clarice Henry?

1:20:39.962 --> 1:20:41.621
Mrs. Henry, the Captain's girl?

1:20:41.695 --> 1:20:44.060
Of course I am.

1:20:44.130 --> 1:20:47.562
Well, what?

1:20:47.562 --> 1:20:49.323
The Captain found her.

1:20:49.395 --> 1:20:51.826
Throat cut.
By her own hand, they say.

1:20:54.695 --> 1:20:57.457
Well, where you fixin' to?

1:20:57.529 --> 1:21:00.825
Well, if it's true,

1:21:00.895 --> 1:21:03.884
gonna pay my respects
to Captain and Mrs. Henry.

1:21:03.963 --> 1:21:06.428
This whole thing's sounds
fishy to me. You comin'?

1:21:06.496 --> 1:21:08.485
Oh, no. No, not today.

1:21:09.796 --> 1:21:13.591
- Shameful day.
- Suit yourself.

1:21:13.661 --> 1:21:18.355
Anyway, Charley gone,
and all of his brothers,

1:21:18.428 --> 1:21:20.019
who's mindin' the zoo?

1:21:22.429 --> 1:21:24.258
Homer?

1:21:27.295 --> 1:21:28.659
<i>1968.</i>

1:21:28.729 --> 1:21:30.956
<i>America watched its war plan collapse,</i>

1:21:31.028 --> 1:21:32.959
<i>its cities burn, its youth erupt,</i>

1:21:33.028 --> 1:21:36.516
<i>its president crumble,
its greatest leaders fall slain.</i>

1:21:36.595 --> 1:21:38.755
<i>And there we were.</i>

1:21:38.829 --> 1:21:40.590
<i>All alone with Richard Nixon.</i>

1:21:43.162 --> 1:21:44.389
No. No. Not at all.

1:21:44.462 --> 1:21:47.656
Come on, face it. Face it, it's over.

1:21:47.729 --> 1:21:49.991
All these groups
promoting the movement

1:21:50.063 --> 1:21:53.051
are so full of their own
president, vice president,

1:21:53.129 --> 1:21:55.459
- and secretary bullshit.
- Not at all.

1:21:55.528 --> 1:21:57.085
They just think
it's all about them, man.

1:21:57.162 --> 1:21:59.219
All these right-wing corporate hawks

1:21:59.295 --> 1:22:01.624
plotting to invade the world,
and drug us to death

1:22:01.695 --> 1:22:03.958
with happy pills and the Bible.

1:22:04.029 --> 1:22:06.858
- It ain't gonna happen.
- I never said that.

1:22:06.928 --> 1:22:10.157
What are you talking about?
You say it all the time.

1:22:10.229 --> 1:22:13.093
I don't know. I think we all agree

1:22:13.162 --> 1:22:15.151
that the world is
a terribly fucked-up place,

1:22:15.229 --> 1:22:18.251
but I happen to feel that
there's something to be done

1:22:18.328 --> 1:22:21.352
to change the situation, and you...

1:22:21.429 --> 1:22:22.951
don't really sound like you...

1:22:23.028 --> 1:22:26.461
He doesn't. Well...

1:22:26.529 --> 1:22:30.359
Well, you want to know
why you think that?

1:22:30.429 --> 1:22:33.395
That, uh, something can
be done to change things?

1:22:33.462 --> 1:22:35.757
Why?

1:22:35.828 --> 1:22:38.454
- Because you're a chick.
- Oh, Jesus, Robbie.

1:22:38.529 --> 1:22:40.461
What's that supposed to mean?

1:22:40.529 --> 1:22:42.222
Oh, forget it.

1:22:44.662 --> 1:22:47.560
Son of a bitch.

1:22:47.629 --> 1:22:50.118
So you're basically a chauvinist.

1:22:50.195 --> 1:22:53.423
Why? Because I think guys
and chicks are different?

1:22:53.496 --> 1:22:54.961
Come on, that's all I'm saying.

1:22:55.028 --> 1:22:56.493
And they are.

1:22:56.561 --> 1:22:59.153
They each have access
to different kinds of pain,

1:22:59.229 --> 1:23:01.388
which is pretty much
why chicks can never be poets.

1:23:01.462 --> 1:23:03.654
- Jesus!
- What?

1:23:03.728 --> 1:23:05.217
Robbie, please,
you're not serious.

1:23:05.295 --> 1:23:07.158
That's the most
preposterous thing I've ever heard.

1:23:07.229 --> 1:23:08.160
Emily Dickinson.

1:23:08.229 --> 1:23:09.889
No, that's not the same.

1:23:09.963 --> 1:23:11.223
As what?

1:23:11.295 --> 1:23:13.318
Whitman, Rimbaud, Shakespeare.

1:23:13.395 --> 1:23:17.157
Grace is...
she's really big into Women's Lib.

1:23:17.229 --> 1:23:19.218
Guys and chicks
are different, I'm sorry.

1:23:19.295 --> 1:23:22.784
I cannot believe you're actually
saying these things.

1:23:22.862 --> 1:23:26.885
I cannot believe you actually think
that women are incapable of...

1:23:26.962 --> 1:23:28.189
Okay, okay, okay.

1:23:28.262 --> 1:23:30.285
Let's try something, huh?

1:23:31.962 --> 1:23:33.791
You write down the nastiest thing
you can think of,

1:23:33.862 --> 1:23:37.851
and I'll write down the nastiest thing
I can think of, and...

1:23:37.928 --> 1:23:39.951
- What?
- We'll compare.

1:23:40.028 --> 1:23:42.517
- But what does that prove?
- Just do it.

1:23:42.596 --> 1:23:44.152
- No.
- Claire, sit down.

1:23:44.229 --> 1:23:45.286
No!

1:23:45.362 --> 1:23:46.850
- No, no, no! I want to know...
- Come on, honey.

1:23:46.928 --> 1:23:48.360
Play the game!

1:23:48.429 --> 1:23:51.622
I want to know what this thing is
that women cannot experience or...

1:23:51.695 --> 1:23:53.161
Cut the fucking snaps!

1:23:53.229 --> 1:23:56.787
Or write about or talk about
or what, put on paper?

1:23:56.862 --> 1:23:59.158
What is this place?

1:23:59.229 --> 1:24:01.218
Do you own this place?

1:24:01.295 --> 1:24:02.761
Did you invent it?

1:24:02.828 --> 1:24:04.385
Uh, no, honey, I don't.

1:24:04.462 --> 1:24:06.053
Claire, come on,
you're missing the point completely.

1:24:06.129 --> 1:24:07.959
I-I worship women.

1:24:08.029 --> 1:24:09.393
Everybody should have one.

1:24:09.462 --> 1:24:11.155
- Yeah, fine.
- Claire!

1:24:11.229 --> 1:24:14.592
Claire, come on. I was kidding.

1:24:14.661 --> 1:24:15.957
Hey, God's a woman.

1:24:17.329 --> 1:24:18.420
Claire.

1:24:19.862 --> 1:24:20.793
Hey!

1:24:20.862 --> 1:24:22.590
Fuck you, man!

1:24:22.662 --> 1:24:23.992
What are you, fucking deaf?

1:24:24.063 --> 1:24:26.221
I told you to stop fucking doing that.

1:24:27.229 --> 1:24:28.490
Fuck.

1:24:32.628 --> 1:24:34.218
What?

1:24:36.194 --> 1:24:37.126
What?

1:24:37.195 --> 1:24:38.661
Nothing.

1:24:41.162 --> 1:24:43.185
You've changed.

1:24:43.262 --> 1:24:44.228
Yeah. Fuck right, I've changed.

1:24:44.295 --> 1:24:46.091
All of this... these new clothes,

1:24:46.162 --> 1:24:47.822
new car, these shades.

1:24:47.896 --> 1:24:49.225
You'd never wear shit like that before.

1:24:49.296 --> 1:24:51.124
Man, you tell me I've changed

1:24:51.195 --> 1:24:53.218
as if that's all there is to say,
you know,

1:24:53.295 --> 1:24:54.282
in this completely different voice

1:24:54.361 --> 1:24:56.827
than the one you had
ten minutes ago.

1:24:56.895 --> 1:24:59.088
You know, kids shooting craps
in an L.A. Garage pot,

1:24:59.162 --> 1:25:01.287
and you say nothing's perfect.

1:25:01.362 --> 1:25:04.624
I say it again: There are no politics.

1:25:06.063 --> 1:25:08.620
Right.

1:25:08.696 --> 1:25:10.753
Well, then, what the fuck is there?

1:25:10.828 --> 1:25:12.021
Huh?

1:25:13.628 --> 1:25:14.992
Sign language.

1:25:38.261 --> 1:25:40.251
<i>No town ever loved Halloween</i>

1:25:40.329 --> 1:25:42.488
<i>like the town of Riddle.</i>

1:25:42.562 --> 1:25:46.289
<i>So who a fellow really was never really
mattered.</i>

1:25:48.029 --> 1:25:51.619
<i>Not with what pretending had to offer.</i>

1:25:51.695 --> 1:25:53.718
<i>It was my kind of town.</i>

1:25:53.795 --> 1:25:55.818
Hey, guys!
You should've seen me.

1:25:55.895 --> 1:25:59.622
I come in like a Ferris wheel,
and, boys, I sure was slick.

1:25:59.695 --> 1:26:02.752
What the heck
are you supposed to be?

1:26:02.828 --> 1:26:04.953
Well, if you don't know,
I'm not gonna tell you.

1:26:05.028 --> 1:26:07.551
<i># Your back is straight,
your hair is smooth #</i>

1:26:07.629 --> 1:26:10.527
<i># On the pillow where you lie #</i>

1:26:12.161 --> 1:26:15.322
<i># But I don't sense affection #</i>

1:26:15.395 --> 1:26:18.827
<i># No gratitude or love #</i>

1:26:18.895 --> 1:26:21.656
<i># Your loyalty is not to me #</i>

1:26:21.728 --> 1:26:25.524
<i># But to the stars above #</i>

1:26:25.595 --> 1:26:30.755
<i># One more cup of coffee 'fore I go #</i>

1:26:32.461 --> 1:26:38.291
<i># One more cup of coffee 'fore I go #</i>

1:26:38.362 --> 1:26:40.884
<i># To the valley below #</i>

1:26:43.095 --> 1:26:44.425
Chester?

1:26:46.795 --> 1:26:48.727
- Billy.
- Mr. McCarty.

1:26:48.795 --> 1:26:51.386
Ma'am.

1:26:51.461 --> 1:26:55.587
So what's with all this
doomsday hocus-pocus going on?

1:26:55.661 --> 1:27:00.253
<i># One more cup of coffee for the road #</i>

1:27:00.329 --> 1:27:03.624
<i># One more cup of coffee 'fore I go #</i>

1:27:03.695 --> 1:27:06.026
You two taking a trip?

1:27:06.095 --> 1:27:08.822
<i># To the valley below #</i>

1:27:11.362 --> 1:27:14.623
Seven simple rules for life in hiding.

1:27:17.528 --> 1:27:19.517
One...

1:27:19.595 --> 1:27:22.993
never trust a cop in a raincoat.

1:27:23.062 --> 1:27:24.721
<i>Two...</i>

1:27:24.795 --> 1:27:28.319
<i>beware of enthusiasm and of love.</i>

1:27:28.395 --> 1:27:32.723
<i>Each is temporary and quick to sway.</i>

1:27:32.794 --> 1:27:35.193
<i>Three...</i>

1:27:35.262 --> 1:27:38.716
<i>when asked if you care
about the world's problems,</i>

1:27:38.795 --> 1:27:42.455
<i>look deep into the eyes of he who asks.</i>

1:27:42.529 --> 1:27:45.426
He will not ask you again.

1:27:45.495 --> 1:27:47.189
Pack up the meat, sweet.

1:27:47.262 --> 1:27:50.456
It's king for king
and queen for queen.

1:27:50.529 --> 1:27:51.858
Afternoon, Mr. McCarty.

1:27:51.928 --> 1:27:53.393
George, Delia.

1:27:53.461 --> 1:27:54.791
<i>Number four and five...</i>

1:27:54.862 --> 1:27:56.522
- Good afternoon, Billy.
- Howdy, Mr. B.

1:27:56.596 --> 1:27:58.151
<i>- Good morning.
...never give your real name.</i>

1:27:58.228 --> 1:28:00.751
Afternoon,
Mr. Gladstone, sir.

1:28:00.828 --> 1:28:02.385
Hey. Hey, hey.

1:28:02.462 --> 1:28:03.894
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1:28:03.963 --> 1:28:05.622
Hey!

1:28:06.662 --> 1:28:08.525
Hey, you all right, son?

1:28:08.596 --> 1:28:10.494
Please, dear man,
you gotta get me outta here.

1:28:10.562 --> 1:28:11.686
This here's chicken town.

1:28:11.761 --> 1:28:13.488
And if ever told to look at yourself...

1:28:17.561 --> 1:28:19.356
<i>never look.</i>

1:28:24.429 --> 1:28:28.122
<i>His singing voice, asthmatic and whiny,</i>

1:28:28.195 --> 1:28:31.683
<i>makes his success
at first seem inconceivable,</i>

1:28:31.761 --> 1:28:34.192
<i>but for so many
of his ardent admirers,</i>

1:28:34.261 --> 1:28:36.284
<i>- Quinn's simple raggedness...
- Here we go.</i>

1:28:36.361 --> 1:28:38.658
<i>... was always the sound of his truth.
Could you pass me that?</i>

1:28:38.728 --> 1:28:41.489
<i>In it, they could conjure
all the hard knocks</i>

1:28:41.561 --> 1:28:44.494
<i>his rough and tumble story implies,</i>

1:28:44.562 --> 1:28:46.653
<i>all the honest struggles</i>

1:28:46.728 --> 1:28:48.887
<i>their far more conventional backgrounds
deny them.</i>

1:28:48.962 --> 1:28:50.360
Jesus.

1:28:50.429 --> 1:28:52.485
<i>- On the other hand...
- This guy's an asshole.</i>

1:28:52.561 --> 1:28:54.789
<i>If Quinn's recent foray
into electronic music</i>

1:28:54.862 --> 1:28:58.420
<i>has raised doubts concerning
his sincerity in the past,</i>

1:28:58.496 --> 1:29:02.053
<i>the startling truth behind
his famously clouded origins</i>

1:29:02.129 --> 1:29:04.061
<i>is sure to close the book
once and for all</i>

1:29:04.129 --> 1:29:05.186
<i>on his future.</i>

1:29:05.262 --> 1:29:06.489
<i>Six...</i>

1:29:06.562 --> 1:29:09.153
never say or do anything

1:29:09.230 --> 1:29:12.524
the person standing in front of you
cannot understand.

1:29:12.595 --> 1:29:16.551
<i>For, despite his unwashed, freewheelin'
credentials,</i>

1:29:16.629 --> 1:29:19.321
<i>and contrary to anything he's ever stated,</i>

1:29:19.394 --> 1:29:20.883
<i>the real Jude Quinn...</i>

1:29:20.962 --> 1:29:24.395
<i>suburban, middle class, educated...</i>

<i>is as conventional as they come.</i>

1:29:26.329 --> 1:29:29.296
<i>The eldest son

<i>department store owner,

<i>And seven...</i>

1:29:47.329 --> 1:29:48.885

1:29:53.294 --> 1:29:55.022
<i>It will be misinterpreted.</i>

1:29:58.027 --> 1:29:59.959
It will chain you and follow you

1:30:00.027 --> 1:30:01.119
for the rest of your life.

1:30:04.462 --> 1:30:07.451
<i>And it will never change.</i>

1:30:18.895 --> 1:30:20.793
<i># Hollis Brown #</i>

1:30:37.262 --> 1:30:40.228
<i>Revenge sits black on your back.</i>

1:30:40.295 --> 1:30:43.887
<i>And wherever you bite,
black scabs grow.</i>

1:30:43.962 --> 1:30:49.191
<i># He lived with his wife

1:31:05.896 --> 1:31:08.123
<i># Down #</i>

For that man
be delivered from revenge,

I want you to take everything
up to your room, okay?

1:31:32.795 --> 1:31:34.784
I'll be up in two minutes for your baths.

1:31:34.862 --> 1:31:35.793
Yes?

1:31:35.862 --> 1:31:37.794
You sound out of breath.

1:31:38.895 --> 1:31:40.861
Oh, so you're back?

1:31:40.928 --> 1:31:42.087
<i>Today.</i>

1:31:42.162 --> 1:31:43.753
<i>How are the girls?</i>

1:31:43.829 --> 1:31:45.226
They're great.

1:31:45.294 --> 1:31:47.022
<i>Busy. Enjoying school.</i>

1:31:47.095 --> 1:31:49.061
That's great.

1:31:49.130 --> 1:31:50.617
And you?

1:31:50.695 --> 1:31:52.820
<i>Fine. We're all fine.</i>

1:31:52.895 --> 1:31:58.054
So, um, which night is boat night?

1:31:59.795 --> 1:32:01.624
Saturday?

1:32:03.228 --> 1:32:05.218
<i>- Hello?
- Uh, yeah.</i>

1:32:05.294 --> 1:32:08.159
<i>Saturday, that's, um...</i>

1:32:08.229 --> 1:32:10.525
day after tomorrow.

1:32:10.595 --> 1:32:12.254
<i>Yep.</i>

1:32:12.328 --> 1:32:13.294
That's fine.

1:32:13.361 --> 1:32:16.351
Mommy, who are you talking to?

1:32:16.429 --> 1:32:18.486
All right, so what time?

1:32:18.561 --> 1:32:21.356
Uh, 11:00?

1:32:21.428 --> 1:32:24.293
Fine.

1:32:24.362 --> 1:32:26.191
Mommy, who are you talking to?

1:32:26.262 --> 1:32:27.887
Molly, what did I tell you about pickup?

1:32:27.962 --> 1:32:29.451
<i>- Upstairs...
- Or I can get 'em earlier, just...</i>

1:32:29.529 --> 1:32:31.993
<i>No, no, no, it's fine, fine.</i>

1:32:32.061 --> 1:32:34.459
<i>But please bring those boxes, okay?</i>

1:32:34.529 --> 1:32:37.188
<i>- I've asked you, like...
- Wait, what boxes?</i>

1:32:37.261 --> 1:32:40.319
The photos. My photos?

1:32:40.395 --> 1:32:41.690
<i>- I've asked you, like...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1:32:41.761 --> 1:32:42.818
Fine. Fine, fine.

1:32:42.895 --> 1:32:45.224
Molly!

1:32:45.294 --> 1:32:46.283
Okay, I gotta go.

1:32:46.362 --> 1:32:47.328
Uh, welcome back.

1:32:47.395 --> 1:32:49.520
<i>Thanks...</i>

1:32:59.695 --> 1:33:01.217
<i>That's right, my friends.</i>

1:33:01.294 --> 1:33:03.853
<i>I am holding the only true account,</i>

1:33:03.928 --> 1:33:06.985
<i>so buy it here, read it there.</i>

1:33:07.062 --> 1:33:09.824
<i>Buy it here, read it there.</i>

1:33:09.895 --> 1:33:12.292
Buy it here, read it there.

1:33:12.361 --> 1:33:15.623
An epic tale of blunder and despair,

1:33:15.695 --> 1:33:18.923
a withering saga
of mystery unveiled,

1:33:18.995 --> 1:33:23.018
a swan song to America
before Chaplin set sail

1:33:23.095 --> 1:33:25.993
or the children of dawn in crazy duress

1:33:26.062 --> 1:33:29.858
ever watched the red sun
without bothering to dress.

1:33:29.928 --> 1:33:32.393
Buy it here, read it there!

1:33:32.461 --> 1:33:35.655
An epic tale of blunder and despair,

1:33:35.728 --> 1:33:39.421

1:33:47.395 --> 1:33:50.054
Thief! Somebody stop that man!

1:33:50.129 --> 1:33:52.219
Stop!

1:33:53.795 --> 1:33:56.260
No!

1:34:10.995 --> 1:34:13.983
# I'm goin' down #

1:34:14.061 --> 1:34:17.494

1:34:17.561 --> 1:34:22.392
# She never does me wrong #

1:34:23.928 --> 1:34:27.985
# She puts it to me #

1:34:28.062 --> 1:34:31.255
# Plain as day #

1:34:31.328 --> 1:34:36.158
# And gives it to me for a song #

1:34:36.228 --> 1:34:40.252
# It's a wicked lie #

1:34:40.329 --> 1:34:43.784
# But what the hell #

1:34:43.862 --> 1:34:48.658
# Don't everybody got to eat? #

1:34:50.195 --> 1:34:53.683
# And I'm just the same #

1:34:53.761 --> 1:34:56.249
# As anyone else #

1:34:56.329 --> 1:34:59.351
# When it comes to scratchin' #

1:34:59.428 --> 1:35:01.793

1:35:03.696 --> 1:35:09.686
# Goin' to Acapulco #

1:35:11.228 --> 1:35:15.558
# Goin' on the run #

1:35:17.261 --> 1:35:19.318
# Goin' down #

1:35:19.394 --> 1:35:24.054
# To see that girl #

1:35:24.129 --> 1:35:28.221
# Gonna have some fun #

1:35:29.995 --> 1:35:34.825
# It's not a bad way to make a livin' #

1:35:36.194 --> 1:35:42.128
# And I ain't complainin' none #

1:35:42.195 --> 1:35:45.753
# Well, I can blow my plum #

1:35:45.828 --> 1:35:48.317
# And drink my rum #

1:35:48.395 --> 1:35:50.690
# And then go on home #

1:35:50.761 --> 1:35:53.954
# And have my fun #

1:35:55.761 --> 1:36:01.752
# Goin' to Acapulco #

1:36:02.862 --> 1:36:06.658

# Yeah #

1:36:27.895 --> 1:36:32.020
# Gonna have some fun #

1:36:34.895 --> 1:36:37.951
<i>Trouble was, I'd grown
partial to the place...</i>

1:36:38.028 --> 1:36:41.118
<i>that sudden smell of fear</i>

1:36:41.194 --> 1:36:42.820
<i>and the thrill of waiting up</i>

1:36:42.895 --> 1:36:45.156
<i>for the end of the world.</i>

1:36:58.728 --> 1:37:03.593

<i># You're losin' all the friends... #</i>

1:37:10.561 --> 1:37:12.686
Congratulations, you're a millionaire.

1:37:12.761 --> 1:37:14.659
- Huh?
- They agreed to everything.

1:37:14.728 --> 1:37:17.159
- Full guarantees.
- How many dates?

1:37:17.228 --> 1:37:19.626
There's 55 additional, I think it was.

1:37:19.695 --> 1:37:21.092
Plus the 30?

1:37:21.161 --> 1:37:23.150
Well, 29, minus tonight is 28.

1:37:23.228 --> 1:37:24.489
That's 83 total.

1:37:24.561 --> 1:37:26.084
83 shows?

1:37:26.162 --> 1:37:27.219
Well, it's not really 83 shows...

1:37:27.295 --> 1:37:30.522
Man, I can't do 83 more shows.

1:37:30.595 --> 1:37:33.390
It's going to fucking kill me
doing 83 more shows.

1:37:33.461 --> 1:37:36.018
Who the fuck said I ever
wanted to be a millionaire?

1:37:36.094 --> 1:37:38.027
Jude!

1:37:38.095 --> 1:37:39.026
Hey.

1:37:39.094 --> 1:37:40.288
Far out show.

1:37:40.362 --> 1:37:41.327
Thanks, man.

1:37:41.394 --> 1:37:43.121
Grab a throne.

1:37:43.194 --> 1:37:44.286
Really?

1:37:44.362 --> 1:37:45.952
Far out.

1:37:46.028 --> 1:37:49.620
You know Norman, my executioner.

1:37:49.696 --> 1:37:55.457
Norman, this is Brian Jones
from that groovy covers band.

1:37:55.528 --> 1:37:58.961
<i># Now you're walkin' round

1:37:59.028 --> 1:38:02.460

1:38:02.528 --> 1:38:05.689

1:38:11.394 --> 1:38:13.292
Find the drinks.

1:38:14.795 --> 1:38:17.919
Look at all these medicines.

1:38:17.995 --> 1:38:20.722
Hey, man, what... what are those?

1:38:20.795 --> 1:38:22.159
Mandies.

1:38:22.229 --> 1:38:23.285
They make you sleep.

1:38:23.361 --> 1:38:26.794
Sleep! I ain't sleepin'.

1:38:26.862 --> 1:38:28.452
Sleep's for dreamers.

1:38:28.528 --> 1:38:31.358
I haven't slept in 30 days, man.

1:38:31.428 --> 1:38:34.327
Takes a lot of medicine
to keep up this pace.

1:38:38.361 --> 1:38:39.452
Coco!

1:38:39.528 --> 1:38:42.653
Norman, darling.

1:38:42.728 --> 1:38:44.717
I know I'm a wretch for being late.

1:38:44.795 --> 1:38:48.625
And it was entirely my fault.

1:38:48.695 --> 1:38:50.684
Hey, what's happening?

1:38:52.128 --> 1:38:54.492
I feel like complete shit
is what's happening.

1:38:54.561 --> 1:38:56.550
Well, you don't look it.

1:39:02.828 --> 1:39:05.317
Aw, true love...

1:39:05.395 --> 1:39:08.020
here in the land
of Charles Atlas and the bomb.

1:39:08.095 --> 1:39:10.424
Oh, fuck off.

1:39:10.495 --> 1:39:14.587
She's been kinda... uptight lately.

1:39:14.661 --> 1:39:15.956
Oh, she has.

1:39:16.027 --> 1:39:17.118
Oh, I see.

1:39:17.194 --> 1:39:20.558
Yes, in fact, if you'd like to know,
it's been complete shit.

1:39:20.628 --> 1:39:23.185
- Angelina's been missing for four days.
- Her cat.

1:39:24.561 --> 1:39:26.789
Judey knows who Angelina is,
don't you, Judey?

1:39:26.862 --> 1:39:30.954
If you're asking if I remember
your little pussy, of course I do.

1:39:34.294 --> 1:39:35.759
Charming.

1:39:35.827 --> 1:39:39.089
She has the sweetest little pussy.

1:39:39.161 --> 1:39:40.185
If you don't count the teeth.

1:39:40.262 --> 1:39:41.284
Okay, man.

1:39:41.361 --> 1:39:43.827
Oh, but properly protected.

1:39:46.262 --> 1:39:48.023
Meow!

1:39:48.095 --> 1:39:49.890
- Baby!
- Don't call me that!

1:39:49.962 --> 1:39:51.984
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

1:39:52.061 --> 1:39:56.154
I tell you, love and sex are two things

1:39:56.229 --> 1:39:59.160
that really hang people up.

1:40:00.528 --> 1:40:03.393
Why that is...

1:40:03.462 --> 1:40:06.484
I'Il... I'll never fully understand.

1:40:09.462 --> 1:40:14.723
<i>Death to all those
who would whimper and cry.</i>

1:40:14.795 --> 1:40:18.193
Did she... Do you think she...

1:40:18.262 --> 1:40:19.887
Don't worry, man.

1:40:19.962 --> 1:40:22.553
She'll be back.

1:40:22.628 --> 1:40:25.719
Chick's gotta shit on something.

1:40:25.795 --> 1:40:27.056
What do you mean?

1:40:27.129 --> 1:40:29.959
What do I mean?

1:40:30.028 --> 1:40:33.118
Who are you?

1:40:33.194 --> 1:40:34.455
I mean...

1:40:34.528 --> 1:40:38.858
who gave you permission
to even be here?

1:40:41.995 --> 1:40:45.791
You're... You're like a shadow, man.

1:40:45.862 --> 1:40:48.487
Maybe you were hip once,

1:40:48.561 --> 1:40:50.857
but that trick got old, man,

1:40:50.928 --> 1:40:52.951
a long time ago.

1:40:53.027 --> 1:40:54.926
Now, every time
you open your mouth,

1:40:54.994 --> 1:40:59.051
it's like, how long is this gonna take?

1:40:59.128 --> 1:41:02.652
It's not like anyone's
gonna tell you to your face.

1:41:02.728 --> 1:41:04.591
No one wants to deal,
you know, with, like,

1:41:04.661 --> 1:41:08.150
a pathetic situation.

1:41:08.229 --> 1:41:09.751
Guess I'm the asshole, right?

1:41:09.828 --> 1:41:13.453
Because I'm the only one
with any balls.

1:41:20.561 --> 1:41:24.323
Oh, man, it's sad.

1:41:26.062 --> 1:41:28.493
You used to be funny.

1:41:28.561 --> 1:41:30.720
And you honestly think
that chick sees you

1:41:30.795 --> 1:41:34.250
as anything but a... as a tool?

1:41:39.428 --> 1:41:41.690
Oh, no, you're kidding me.

1:41:41.761 --> 1:41:43.489
I can't even watch this.

1:41:43.562 --> 1:41:45.255
<i>The sky isn't yellow.</i>

1:41:45.329 --> 1:41:46.919
<i>It's chicken.</i>

1:41:49.062 --> 1:41:52.687
You know, people said
you could be a real cocksucker.

1:41:52.761 --> 1:41:56.523
Well, it's not what goes
into a man's mouth, babe,

1:41:56.595 --> 1:41:57.526
that defiles it.

1:41:57.594 --> 1:42:00.527
No, it's what comes out.

1:42:00.595 --> 1:42:05.857
Good and evil were invented
by people trapped in scenes.

1:42:09.362 --> 1:42:10.759
Uh!

1:42:10.828 --> 1:42:11.952
Oh, damn it.

1:42:12.027 --> 1:42:13.856
Come on, let's get him outta here.

1:42:13.927 --> 1:42:16.156

You're liable to get yourself killed!

1:44:19.061 --> 1:44:21.426
<i>Start walking right,
and pretty soon,</i>

1:44:21.496 --> 1:44:23.552
<i>there's someone
gonna drag you down.</i>

1:44:23.628 --> 1:44:27.026
<i>Sure as we're living, sure as we're born,</i>

1:44:27.095 --> 1:44:29.583
<i>look up, look up.</i>

1:44:29.661 --> 1:44:33.184
<i>Gabriel blows his horn.</i>

1:44:33.261 --> 1:44:35.454
He was having a lot of worries,

1:44:35.527 --> 1:44:38.323
telling me things.

1:44:38.394 --> 1:44:42.383
I just asked him one day,
I said, "Have you ever prayed?"

1:44:42.461 --> 1:44:46.917
And he said, "Pray?"

1:44:46.995 --> 1:44:49.484
You know, like that.

1:44:49.561 --> 1:44:52.391
And he started asking
a lot of questions.

1:44:52.461 --> 1:44:54.926
<i>I didn't know him then,</i>

1:44:54.994 --> 1:44:57.825
<i>but I sure knew who he was.</i>

1:44:57.895 --> 1:44:59.952
<i>People worshipped him.</i>

1:45:00.028 --> 1:45:02.516
Maybe only Jesus
could've unburdened

1:45:02.595 --> 1:45:06.459
someone like that
from such omnipotence.

1:45:06.528 --> 1:45:09.051
In spring of 1974,

1:45:09.129 --> 1:45:12.060
Jack Rollins followed
girlfriend Angela Reeves

1:45:12.128 --> 1:45:13.855
to Stockton, California,

1:45:13.927 --> 1:45:16.155
and enrolled in a course in Bible study

1:45:16.228 --> 1:45:19.820
here at the California
Gateway Brotherhood Church,

1:45:19.895 --> 1:45:23.122
a Pentecostal assembly
just outside Stockton.

1:45:23.194 --> 1:45:24.660
Six months later,

1:45:24.728 --> 1:45:27.922
Rollins accepted Jesus into his heart.

1:45:27.995 --> 1:45:30.483
<i>Today, the one-time '60s folk hero</i>

1:45:30.561 --> 1:45:33.186
<i>is a fully ordained member
of the Gateway Ministry</i>

1:45:33.261 --> 1:45:36.489
<i>and an active figure in the state's
evangelical community.</i>

1:45:36.561 --> 1:45:39.083
<i>And yet, for the past two decades,</i>

1:45:39.161 --> 1:45:41.923
<i>Father John has remained
silent about his past.</i>

1:45:41.995 --> 1:45:43.427
<i>I asked him why.</i>

1:45:43.495 --> 1:45:47.825
Old things are passed away.

1:45:47.895 --> 1:45:50.224
All things are made anew.

1:45:50.294 --> 1:45:52.556
It doesn't matter what I did before.

1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:56.356
I've never lied to you.

1:45:56.428 --> 1:45:59.292
Never told you who to vote for
or to follow anybody,

1:45:59.361 --> 1:46:02.521
back then when
I was selling my records.

1:46:02.595 --> 1:46:04.151
What I didn't know
is that it didn't matter

1:46:04.228 --> 1:46:06.990
what kind of music you were playing.

1:46:07.062 --> 1:46:12.392
Folk, pop, rock 'n roll...

1:46:12.461 --> 1:46:14.393
we're all rolled up
in the devil's pocket.

1:46:14.461 --> 1:46:20.553
Now, I'm not talking about a devil
with the pitchfork and horns.

1:46:20.628 --> 1:46:26.424
I'm talking about a spiritual devil
in the midnight hour.

1:46:26.495 --> 1:46:29.859
He's gotta be overcome.

1:46:29.928 --> 1:46:35.189
And we here in America,
we shall overcome.

1:46:35.261 --> 1:46:39.057
What greater honor for a nation

1:46:39.128 --> 1:46:41.617
than to speak for God?

1:46:41.761 --> 1:46:43.920
For some say that the war
to end all wars

1:46:43.995 --> 1:46:46.290
has already begun
right now in the Middle East,

1:46:46.361 --> 1:46:50.123
where it is prophesized
that the weak will fall.

1:46:52.528 --> 1:46:55.550
And that Jesus will set up
His kingdom in Jerusalem.

1:46:55.627 --> 1:46:59.526
So why should we worry
when we're already free,

1:46:59.595 --> 1:47:00.958
right here, right now?

1:47:01.027 --> 1:47:02.254
And why are you free?

1:47:02.328 --> 1:47:04.123
You're free because Jesus
paid for you to be.

1:47:04.194 --> 1:47:05.626
That's why you're free.

1:47:05.695 --> 1:47:10.094
You're free to seek
the higher calling of the Lord.

1:47:11.660 --> 1:47:15.820
Now pick up your bed and walk.

1:47:15.895 --> 1:47:18.883
# I'm pressin' on #

1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:26.488

1:48:20.628 --> 1:48:24.355
- # There's nothing you lack #
- # Nothin' that you lack #

1:48:24.428 --> 1:48:27.293
# Temptation, not an easy thing #

1:48:27.362 --> 1:48:31.088

1:48:31.161 --> 1:48:33.888
# 'Cause he sinned I got no choice #

1:48:33.961 --> 1:48:36.655

1:48:36.727 --> 1:48:39.250

1:51:11.360 --> 1:51:13.326
Not with the girls.

1:51:13.393 --> 1:51:15.826
- Yes, Robbie.
- No.

1:51:15.895 --> 1:51:16.825
Robbie!

1:51:16.894 --> 1:51:19.156
You're not taking my kids!

1:51:19.228 --> 1:51:20.955
What are you going to do?

1:51:21.027 --> 1:51:23.323
What would you do?

1:51:23.394 --> 1:51:25.190
Because I would, you know?

1:51:25.262 --> 1:51:27.160
Perhaps I even would.

1:51:27.229 --> 1:51:29.490
If you actually could, who knows?

1:51:32.461 --> 1:51:35.722
But I'm not going to take your children
away from you, Robbie,

1:51:35.795 --> 1:51:39.750
so you don't have to...
to try and threaten me.

<i>First place that

1:55:09.828 --> 1:55:12.089
So, good people of Riddle,

1:55:12.161 --> 1:55:15.490
we come here with no intent to disrupt,

1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:18.856
but only to commend you
for your patient courage

1:55:18.927 --> 1:55:20.859
in this time of change.

1:55:20.927 --> 1:55:23.893
And in addition,
we are pleased to announce

1:55:23.961 --> 1:55:27.325
the evacuation fund has been established
by the state of Missouri

1:55:27.394 --> 1:55:29.020
as I pledged to you it would be.

1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:36.249
Exactly what does that do
for the common folk like myself?

1:55:36.328 --> 1:55:38.089
Dollar compensation

1:55:38.161 --> 1:55:41.650
will be made available to, uh, uh...

1:55:41.728 --> 1:55:43.591
Eligible evacuees.

1:55:43.661 --> 1:55:45.422
So what you want to do
is throw some pennies

1:55:45.495 --> 1:55:46.984
after you done took our lives!

1:55:48.061 --> 1:55:49.993
I assure you, boy,

1:55:50.061 --> 1:55:52.493
nobody here in the business
of taking lives.

1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:56.652
Might wanna explain that
to Ms. Henry up there.

1:55:56.727 --> 1:55:59.319
Yeah, or Ms. Montgomery.

1:55:59.394 --> 1:56:01.656
Or how about Old Man Sykes?

1:56:01.728 --> 1:56:03.058
Yeah, well, the way I see it,

1:56:03.129 --> 1:56:05.560
you can either go through Riddle,
or you can go around them,

1:56:05.628 --> 1:56:07.026
so why are you going
through our town?

1:56:07.095 --> 1:56:09.152
Yeah, that's right,
that's right, he said it.

1:56:09.228 --> 1:56:10.784
Who is that talking?

1:56:10.861 --> 1:56:13.123
You there.

1:56:13.193 --> 1:56:14.989
- What's your name?
- My name?

1:56:15.061 --> 1:56:17.822
- Mm.
- William.

1:56:17.894 --> 1:56:20.360
William, did you say?
Show your face.

1:56:22.194 --> 1:56:23.853
Yes, sir.

1:56:25.528 --> 1:56:28.187
I had... I had a friend...

1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:32.958
However, thing is, sir, truly,

1:56:33.027 --> 1:56:35.993
you got us hanging by a thread here.

1:56:36.061 --> 1:56:38.788
Who are you? I know you.

1:56:38.861 --> 1:56:41.259
I don't reckon so.

1:56:41.328 --> 1:56:43.124
You ever live in Dallas County?

1:56:43.194 --> 1:56:45.683
- Can't say I have.
- New Mexico?

1:56:45.761 --> 1:56:47.317
No!

1:56:47.394 --> 1:56:51.155
You were talented.
Boy, you could shoot.

1:56:51.227 --> 1:56:53.786
You could sing a ditty
like nobody I ever seen.

1:56:53.861 --> 1:56:56.259
You got... You got any musical strain?

1:56:58.061 --> 1:57:00.323
I never had the knack.

1:57:00.394 --> 1:57:03.690
What we're saying
is that you and your boys,

1:57:03.761 --> 1:57:04.988
you go do as you please,

1:57:05.062 --> 1:57:07.584
just so long as you stay clear
of Riddle County.

1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:12.749
Do you think you're speaking
for the people, sir?

1:57:12.827 --> 1:57:15.816
You are just stirring up lies
and getting folks agitated.

1:57:15.894 --> 1:57:16.985
Now, we have methods

1:57:17.061 --> 1:57:19.118
for dealing with
scoundrels like yourself.

1:57:28.995 --> 1:57:30.619
Boys, bring him in!

1:57:30.694 --> 1:57:32.785
Hey, hey, what do you
think you're doing?

1:57:35.127 --> 1:57:36.491
Quiet down!

1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:39.527
No need to get off to cause
another insurgence...

1:57:41.028 --> 1:57:43.186
Take care of my horse!
Take care of my horse!

1:57:52.660 --> 1:57:54.683
<i>Takes a thief to catch a thief.</i>

1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:56.386
<i># She cried both day and night #</i>

1:57:56.460 --> 1:58:01.325
<i># I know it because it was there #</i>

1:58:03.361 --> 1:58:06.418
<i># It's a milestone #</i>

1:58:06.495 --> 1:58:09.427
<i># But she's down on her luck #</i>

1:58:09.495 --> 1:58:13.052
<i># And she mainly so lonely #</i>

1:58:13.127 --> 1:58:16.390
<i># But to make him hard to buck #</i>

1:58:16.460 --> 1:58:19.018
<i># I was there #</i>

1:58:21.561 --> 1:58:23.493
<i>I know I have a sickness...</i>

1:58:23.561 --> 1:58:26.288
<i>festering somewhere.</i>

1:58:26.361 --> 1:58:27.951
<i>I don't mean like Woody Guthrie,</i>

1:58:28.027 --> 1:58:29.687
<i>wasting away in some hospital.</i>

1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:32.386
His vitals are stable.

1:58:32.460 --> 1:58:34.086
What he needs is sleep.

1:58:34.161 --> 1:58:35.559
<i>I couldn't do that.</i>

1:58:35.628 --> 1:58:37.526
<i>Decay like that.</i>

1:58:37.595 --> 1:58:41.152
That's nature's will,
and I'm against nature.

1:58:42.727 --> 1:58:45.523
I don't dig nature at all.

1:58:45.595 --> 1:58:48.686
I don't think he can get back on stage.

1:58:48.761 --> 1:58:51.487
He's gotten inside so many psyches,

1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:55.653
and death is just such a part
of the American scene right now.

1:58:55.728 --> 1:58:58.159
It's the reds that make him mean.

1:58:58.228 --> 1:59:01.126
He's already gone.

1:59:01.194 --> 1:59:05.354
<i>The only truly natural things are dreams,</i>

1:59:05.428 --> 1:59:08.259
<i>which nature cannot
touch with decay.</i>

1:59:08.329 --> 1:59:11.418
<i># When I'm there, she's all right #</i>

1:59:11.494 --> 1:59:14.927
<i># But she's not when I'm gone #</i>

1:59:17.495 --> 1:59:21.019
<i># Heaven knows that the answer #</i>

1:59:21.094 --> 1:59:24.288
<i># She don't call no one #</i>

1:59:24.361 --> 1:59:25.622
<i># She's the way #</i>

1:59:25.695 --> 1:59:27.593
<i># For sailing beautiful #</i>

1:59:27.661 --> 1:59:30.558
<i># She's mine for the one #</i>

1:59:30.627 --> 1:59:33.889
<i># And I lost a heavy tension #</i>

1:59:33.961 --> 1:59:36.984
<i># By temptation as it runs #</i>

1:59:37.060 --> 1:59:39.550
<i># But she don't follow me #</i>

1:59:39.628 --> 1:59:41.594
<i># But I'm not there #</i>

1:59:41.661 --> 1:59:43.388
<i># I'm gone #</i>

1:59:49.495 --> 1:59:52.756
<i># Now I'll cry tonight #</i>

1:59:52.827 --> 1:59:55.452
<i># Like I cried the night before #</i>

1:59:55.528 --> 1:59:58.925
<i># And I'll feast on the highs #</i>

1:59:58.994 --> 2:00:02.154
<i># But I'll dream about the door #</i>

2:00:02.228 --> 2:00:05.217
<i># So long, Jesus, savior #</i>

2:00:05.294 --> 2:00:06.487
<i># Blind faith #</i>

2:00:06.561 --> 2:00:08.357
<i># Is the tale #</i>

2:00:08.428 --> 2:00:11.587
<i># It don't have confirmation #</i>

2:00:11.660 --> 2:00:15.251
<i># She smiles fairly well #</i>

2:00:17.661 --> 2:00:20.957
<i># Now, when I choose to live it #</i>

2:00:21.028 --> 2:00:24.016
<i># I was born to love her #</i>

2:00:24.094 --> 2:00:26.253
<i># But she knows that #</i>

2:00:26.328 --> 2:00:27.589
<i># The kingdom waits #</i>

2:00:27.661 --> 2:00:30.490
<i># So high above her #</i>

2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:31.992
<i># And I run #</i>

2:00:32.061 --> 2:00:33.651
<i># Then I race #</i>

2:00:33.727 --> 2:00:37.090
<i># But it's not too fast to stand #</i>

2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:38.751
<i># But I don't perceive her #</i>

2:00:38.827 --> 2:00:39.850
<i># I'm not there #</i>

2:00:39.927 --> 2:00:41.086
Don't worry, Mr. B.

2:00:41.161 --> 2:00:43.888
Your secret's safe with me.

2:00:43.961 --> 2:00:46.291
God save the secrets.

2:00:49.561 --> 2:00:50.685
And you too, Homer.

2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:52.885
Come on.

2:00:55.661 --> 2:00:59.023
<i># I don't need anybody now #</i>

2:00:59.093 --> 2:01:01.787
<i># Beside me to tell #</i>

2:01:01.861 --> 2:01:04.919
<i># And it's all revelation #</i>

2:01:04.995 --> 2:01:06.483
<i># I recede #</i>

2:01:06.561 --> 2:01:07.719
<i># Good night #</i>

2:01:07.794 --> 2:01:10.954
<i># She's a long-bodied beauty #</i>

2:01:11.026 --> 2:01:14.255
<i># But she's gone like a smile #</i>

2:01:14.328 --> 2:01:16.294
<i># And she's gone #</i>

2:01:20.194 --> 2:01:23.887
<i># Yeah, she's gone like the rainbow #</i>

2:01:23.961 --> 2:01:26.860
<i># That was shinin' yesterday #</i>

2:01:26.928 --> 2:01:29.950
<i># But now she's old beside me #</i>

2:01:30.027 --> 2:01:31.652
<i># And I'd like to hear... #</i>

2:01:31.726 --> 2:01:33.488
Henry!

2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:35.493
Henry!

2:01:35.561 --> 2:01:36.821
Come on, Henry. Come on, girl.

2:01:36.894 --> 2:01:37.825
Come on.

2:01:37.894 --> 2:01:39.520
Come on!

2:01:39.595 --> 2:01:41.220
Henry!

2:01:41.294 --> 2:01:43.157
Come on!

2:01:44.828 --> 2:01:47.350
Bye, Henry!

2:01:53.060 --> 2:01:55.219
Good-bye, my lady.

2:02:28.528 --> 2:02:32.982
<i># With your mercury mouth #</i>

2:02:33.060 --> 2:02:37.357
<i># In the missionary times #</i>

2:02:37.428 --> 2:02:41.326
<i># And your eyes like smoke #</i>

2:02:41.394 --> 2:02:46.088
<i># And your prayers like rhymes #</i>

2:02:46.161 --> 2:02:49.684
<i># And your silver cross #</i>

2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:54.749
<i># And your voice
like chimes #</i>

2:02:54.827 --> 2:02:56.452
Doesn't really matter, you know,

2:02:56.527 --> 2:03:01.256
what kind of nasty names
people invent for the music.

2:03:01.328 --> 2:03:05.124
But, uh, folk music
is just a word, you know,

2:03:05.194 --> 2:03:08.888
that I can't use anymore.

2:03:08.961 --> 2:03:12.052
What I'm talking about
is traditional music,

2:03:12.128 --> 2:03:14.593
right, which is to say
it's mathematical music,

2:03:14.660 --> 2:03:17.320
it's based on hexagons.

2:03:17.394 --> 2:03:21.087
But all these songs
about, you know,

2:03:21.161 --> 2:03:23.252
roses growing
out of people's brains

2:03:23.328 --> 2:03:25.419
and lovers who are
really geese and swans

2:03:25.495 --> 2:03:27.051
are turning into angels...

2:03:27.128 --> 2:03:29.753
I mean, you know,
they're not going to die.

2:03:29.827 --> 2:03:31.621
They're not folk music songs.

2:03:31.693 --> 2:03:34.524
They're political songs.

2:03:34.594 --> 2:03:36.355
They're already dead.

2:03:37.627 --> 2:03:41.526
You'd think that these traditional music people

2:03:41.594 --> 2:03:44.720
would... would gather
that mystery, you know,

2:03:44.795 --> 2:03:46.727
is a traditional fact, you know,

2:03:46.795 --> 2:03:49.420
seeing as they're
all so full of mystery.

2:03:49.495 --> 2:03:50.959
And contradictions.

2:03:51.026 --> 2:03:53.254
Yeah, contradictions.

2:03:53.327 --> 2:03:55.850
And chaos.

2:03:55.927 --> 2:03:58.688
Yes, it's chaos, clocks,
and watermelons...

2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:00.282
You know, it's... it's everything.

2:04:06.294 --> 2:04:09.124
These people actually think
I have some kind of, uh...

2:04:11.093 --> 2:04:15.048
fantastic imagination.

2:04:15.127 --> 2:04:17.025
It gets very, uh, lonesome.

2:04:19.328 --> 2:04:21.453
But traditional music

2:04:21.528 --> 2:04:23.016
is just, uh...

2:04:23.094 --> 2:04:24.788
It's too unreal to die.

2:04:24.862 --> 2:04:27.350
It doesn't need to be protected.

2:04:27.428 --> 2:04:29.257
You know, I mean,
in that music is the only

2:04:29.328 --> 2:04:31.156
true valid death
you can feel today,

2:04:31.227 --> 2:04:34.682
you know, off a record player.

2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:38.158
But like everything else in great demand,
people try to own it.

2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:46.118
Has to do with, like,
uh, the purity thing.

2:04:48.162 --> 2:04:50.649
I think its meaninglessness is holy.

2:04:53.528 --> 2:04:56.119
Everybody knows I'm not a folk singer.

2:05:46.961 --> 2:05:49.450
<i>People are always talking about freedom.</i>

2:05:49.528 --> 2:05:52.288
<i>Freedom to live a certain way</i>

2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:54.451
<i>without being kicked around.</i>

2:06:00.694 --> 2:06:03.592
<i>Course, the more
you live a certain way,</i>

2:06:03.660 --> 2:06:05.354
<i>the less it feels like freedom.</i>

2:06:12.694 --> 2:06:16.285
<i>Me? I can change during
the course of a day.</i>

2:06:16.360 --> 2:06:18.451
<i>I wake and I'm one person,</i>

2:06:18.527 --> 2:06:20.288
<i>and when I go to sleep, I know for certain</i>

2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:23.054
<i>I'm somebody else.</i>

2:06:23.128 --> 2:06:25.185
<i>I don't know who I am,
most of the time.</i>

2:06:39.660 --> 2:06:42.217
<i>It's like you got yesterday,</i>

2:06:42.293 --> 2:06:45.589
<i>today, and tomorrow,
all in the same room.</i>

2:06:50.660 --> 2:06:53.023
<i>There's no tellin' what can happen.</i>

2:08:28.228 --> 2:08:30.659
<i># Once upon a time,
you dressed so fine #</i>

2:08:30.727 --> 2:08:32.919
<i># Threw the bums a dime
in your prime #</i>

2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:36.451
<i># Didn't you? #</i>

2:08:38.393 --> 2:08:40.359
<i># People call, say beware, doll #</i>

2:08:40.427 --> 2:08:42.893

2:08:49.027 --> 2:08:52.515
<i># You used to laugh about #</i>

<i># Everybody that was hangin' out #</i>

2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:01.724
<i># Now you don't talk so loud #</i>

2:09:03.261 --> 2:09:07.590
<i># Now you don't seem so proud #</i>

2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:11.319
<i># About havin' to be scrounging #</i>

2:09:11.393 --> 2:09:16.382
<i># Your next meal #</i>

2:09:16.460 --> 2:09:18.517
<i># How does it feel? #</i>

2:09:21.560 --> 2:09:23.288
<i># How does it feel #</i>

2:09:26.061 --> 2:09:28.357
<i># To be without a home #</i>

2:09:31.127 --> 2:09:33.855
<i># Like a complete unknown #</i>

2:09:35.894 --> 2:09:38.416
<i># Like a rolling stone? #</i>

2:09:59.094 --> 2:10:01.855
<i># Things are crashing better #</i>

2:10:01.927 --> 2:10:05.484
<i># She's all too tight #</i>

2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:07.356
<i># In my neighborhood #</i>

2:10:07.427 --> 2:10:10.790
<i># She cried both day and night #</i>

2:10:10.860 --> 2:10:14.055
<i># She's a lone-hearted mystic #</i>

2:10:14.127 --> 2:10:17.117
<i># And she can't carry on #</i>

2:10:17.194 --> 2:10:20.353
<i># When I'm there, she's all right #</i>

2:10:20.427 --> 2:10:23.689

2:10:39.194 --> 2:10:42.284

2:10:42.360 --> 2:10:45.088
<i># About temptation as it runs #</i>

2:10:45.161 --> 2:10:48.457
<i># She don't follow me #</i>

2:10:48.528 --> 2:10:50.186
<i># I'm leaving #</i>

2:10:50.260 --> 2:10:51.556
<i># I'm gone #</i>

2:10:54.694 --> 2:10:57.626
<i># Now, I'll cry tonight #</i>

2:10:57.694 --> 2:11:00.990
<i># Like I cried the night before #</i>

2:11:01.061 --> 2:11:03.993
<i># And I'll feast on the highway #</i>

2:11:04.060 --> 2:11:07.118

2:11:07.194 --> 2:11:08.490

2:11:08.561 --> 2:11:10.287

2:11:16.494 --> 2:11:20.119
<i># She smiles fairly well #</i>

2:11:23.061 --> 2:11:25.788
<i># Her smile is contagious #</i>

2:11:25.861 --> 2:11:28.827
<i># I was born to love her #</i>

2:11:28.894 --> 2:11:31.860
<i># But she knows that the kingdom #</i>

2:11:31.927 --> 2:11:35.051

2:11:35.127 --> 2:11:36.423

2:11:36.494 --> 2:11:38.050

2:11:41.194 --> 2:11:44.216

2:11:46.294 --> 2:11:48.089

2:11:56.427 --> 2:11:59.450

<i># Sleep, but she's hard #</i>

2:12:00.727 --> 2:12:02.784
<i># Too hard to breathe #</i>

2:12:02.861 --> 2:12:04.121
<i># It's a load #</i>

2:12:04.193 --> 2:12:05.591
<i># It's a crime #</i>

2:12:05.660 --> 2:12:08.650
<i># The way she mauls me around #</i>

2:12:08.727 --> 2:12:11.716
<i># But she don't phone to hate me #</i>

2:12:11.794 --> 2:12:14.953
<i># But it's time to make the clown #</i>

2:12:17.727 --> 2:12:20.887

2:12:20.961 --> 2:12:24.017
