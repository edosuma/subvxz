00:09.977 --> 00:13.514

00:13.647 --> 00:15.183

00:15.316 --> 00:17.351
- Year to what?
- Live.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.320
- You know, I'm
stronger than you think.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.021
- No you're not.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.591
I need, uh, Carlos Jimenez.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.026
- Carlos runs the Locos, right?
I got a warrant.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.196
- What for?
- Child support payments.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.398
- He's at the ranch.
- MIKE: It's over off Persimmon.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.066
It's where they got their dogs
they fight in there.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.867
If you see him, pick
him up on that warrant.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.238
- [buzzer]

00:37.371 --> 00:39.473
- Y'all got the wrong cell, cuz.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.276
[grunts, yelps]

00:42.410 --> 00:44.512
- Everything you
have I gave you.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.815
And now I'm taking it all back.
- Why?

00:47.948 --> 00:50.118
- Because you asked for more.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.519
Put him in ad seg.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.824
- [gunshot]
- [glass shattering]

00:56.957 --> 01:00.027
- [gunfire]

01:03.331 --> 01:05.966

01:09.503 --> 01:12.840
- [siren wailing]
- [indistinct chatter]

01:12.973 --> 01:15.042
- What the fuck were you
doing in there, huh?

01:19.113 --> 01:20.314
- Hey, get back.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.882
- I'm looking for, uh,
Detective McLusky.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.284
He's my brother.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.785
- Are you a cop?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.687
I didn't fucking think so.
Get behind the line.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.829
- [phone ringing]

01:35.963 --> 01:37.365
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.766
I'm by the coroner's van.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.701
Can you, uh, come get me?
Cops won't let me in.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.536
- All right, I gotcha, I gotcha.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.008
Yo.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.279
- How are you doin'?
- Hey man,

01:51.412 --> 01:53.514
they ain't done with 'em yet,
so we gotta hang back.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.848
- Okay.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.853
- What were you doing?
Huh?

01:59.987 --> 02:01.555
- What's up, Mike?
- Hey, bud.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.057
- I got your prints
on the murder weapon.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.026
Tell me. Tell me.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.561
- [whimpers]

02:12.200 --> 02:14.067
- [indistinct chatter]

02:19.607 --> 02:22.009
- Hey. Do you work here?

02:22.142 --> 02:25.313
- 'Til about an hour ago.
- What happened?

02:25.446 --> 02:28.549
- My boss started shooting
at those guys over there,

02:28.682 --> 02:30.318
and they killed him.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.852
- What about this guy over here?

02:33.254 --> 02:34.588
- I don't know.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.459
- You want one?

02:38.592 --> 02:40.127
- Fuck it.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.931
[sighs]

02:47.435 --> 02:49.069
[sighs]

02:50.271 --> 02:51.572
- --fucking staring at?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.541
I want my fucking union
rep, you fucking dick.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.742
- What the fuck?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.410
- It's my responsibility
to determine

02:56.544 --> 02:58.479
if this was a legal shooting,
not your union rep.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.013
- He shot at us!

03:00.147 --> 03:01.949
- You didn't identify
yourselves as police officers!

03:02.082 --> 03:03.016
- Fuck you!

03:03.150 --> 03:04.318
- Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?

03:04.452 --> 03:05.619
What are you doing?

03:05.753 --> 03:07.154
You know you can't
interview these guys

03:07.288 --> 03:08.922
until there's a written report
from the watch commander.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.524
- Are you the watch commander?

03:10.658 --> 03:13.461
- No, I'm just a witness--to
you violating their rights.

03:13.594 --> 03:14.628
- I'm entitled to canvass
the scene

03:14.762 --> 03:16.497
of any officer-involved
shooting.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.898
- Well, that's the
scene right there,

03:18.031 --> 03:20.167
with a dead guy and
the fucking yellow tape.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.570
- If we do this at the
station, it's official.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.171
It's recorded.
Keep that in mind.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.507
Here is the best place
to work this out.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.775
- What the fuck
are you doing here?

03:27.908 --> 03:29.477
- What the fuck
are you doing here?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.579
- I'm looking after my brother.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.846
- Your brother's fine, Mike.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.382
The clerk had a
rough night, though.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.717
- Yeah, maybe he shouldn't
shoot the customers.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.952
And hey, by the way,
defense counsel here,

03:39.086 --> 03:41.922
as you observe this interview--
even if you had a case,

03:42.055 --> 03:44.658
and now you don't,
want to give us a minute?

03:44.792 --> 03:46.327
- You're gonna figure
it all out, Mike?

03:46.460 --> 03:47.828
- Best I can.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.863
- Then give it your best shot.
- Thank you.

03:52.199 --> 03:55.035
Hey. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fucking fine.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.670
- I'm fine too, Mike.
Thanks for asking.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.572
- Yeah, way to defuse
the situation, Ian.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.141
- I don't know what to tell ya.
I fucking went in the back door.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.577
The tweaker's sitting right
behind Kyle at the table.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.313
As soon as I step
outta that hallway,

04:05.446 --> 04:06.714
the fucking pizza guy--

04:06.847 --> 04:08.749
the pizza guy unloads
a pistol at my head--

04:08.882 --> 04:10.183
- Yeah, we had no choice, Mike.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.521
- Look, look, I'm not
questioning that, okay?

04:13.654 --> 04:15.523
Was, uh, was the tweaker armed?

04:15.656 --> 04:19.627
- Yeah, he had a knife,
crack pipe, and two dollars.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.128
- Anybody run the pizza guy?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.930
- No, I didn't, but
I'm sure somebody did.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.532
- --tats all the way
up his arm, Mike.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.800
He's selling more meth
than he is fucking pepperoni.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.569
- Hey, look,
I'm gonna talk to Tom

04:28.702 --> 04:30.237
and see what side
of the fence he's on.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.472
- Thanks, man.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.974
- [indistinct chatter]

04:34.107 --> 04:35.809
- MIKE:
Tom, what the fuck?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.478
Come on, what's up
with grinding my brother?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.413
- I'm trying to keep a lid on
this and they're freaking out.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.148
- Yeah, well, you know,
interviewing them in front of

04:41.281 --> 04:43.183
a district attorney is not
really putting a lid on it.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.685
- Mike, look, when they
get to the station,

04:44.818 --> 04:45.919
they're gonna be
put in different rooms

04:46.053 --> 04:47.154
and then asked
the same questions.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.155
And if their answers
are different,

04:48.288 --> 04:49.490
they got a real fucking problem.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.024
- Okay, look, let's just
stop thinking about this

04:51.158 --> 04:52.960
as a shooting and start
thinking about like a drug bust,

04:53.093 --> 04:54.495
cuz that's what it is.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.896
That pizza guy's a
fucking drug dealer, all right?

04:56.029 --> 04:57.365
That's his customer.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.032
And these guys just
walked in on it, all right?

04:59.166 --> 05:02.636
It's that simple.
That's what it is.

05:02.770 --> 05:06.374
- They find drugs on the victim?
- Not yet.

05:06.507 --> 05:10.578
- Sure would simplify matters.
- Approach it from that angle.

05:10.711 --> 05:14.815
- *

05:20.721 --> 05:22.756
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.358
- This guy's a drug dealer.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.761
- How do you know?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.296
- Look, you have one of
his customers handcuffed

05:29.430 --> 05:30.931
on a sidewalk outside.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.734
Then 15 more across the street
freezing their asses off,

05:33.867 --> 05:36.303
just waiting to
see what you find.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.705
Hey, ask that tweaker
the right questions

05:37.838 --> 05:40.007
and then get the right answers.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.142
- All right. I'm on it.

05:42.275 --> 05:50.618
- *

05:51.885 --> 05:54.988
- Sure Mike, come on and help
yourself to my crime scene.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.391
- Yeah. Look, everyone's looking
at this at the wrong angle.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.226
- Well, illuminate me, Mike.
What's the right angle?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.328
- You ran the guy?
- Yeah, sure we ran the guy.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.398
- Okay, how many--how many
drug convictions he got?

06:04.532 --> 06:06.734
- [sighs] Three.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.436
- How many years he do?
- Seven.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.604
- Okay, so you got a felon
in possession of a firearm.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.839
That's one.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.641
Have you searched
the place for drugs?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.008
Looked at his vehicle?

06:15.142 --> 06:16.376
- You're trying to change
the narrative, Mike?

06:16.510 --> 06:18.846
- Oh no, just clarifying it.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.013
They walked into a drug deal.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.515
- That a fact?
- That's it.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.383
- If they walked in the
middle of a drug deal,

06:23.517 --> 06:24.885
where are the drugs?

06:25.018 --> 06:28.088
- They'll find them.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.223
- You know, criminals
can be victims too, Mike.

06:30.357 --> 06:33.461
- Yeah, and victims
can still be criminals.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.031
- Hey, leave
the body until homicide

06:38.165 --> 06:39.567
has had a chance to examine it.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.234
- They can examine the body
at the coroner's office.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.370
- Well, they need
to search it here.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.938
Wait outside.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.410
- Thank you.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.681
- I got a client for you.

06:53.814 --> 06:54.982
- MIKE: Client?
- Yeah.

06:55.115 --> 06:58.118
- How about we do
dinner later this week?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.320
- The timing, Mike?
- Yeah.

07:04.357 --> 07:16.303

08:07.888 --> 08:12.492

08:15.462 --> 08:17.565

08:17.698 --> 08:20.868
- [indistinct chatter]

08:22.570 --> 08:23.637
- [buzzer]

08:23.771 --> 08:25.005
- None of them are
worth a fuck.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.640
- Belichick!

08:26.774 --> 08:28.609
- No, man. Since Brady left,
he ain't worth a fuck either.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.910
None of them.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.178
- It doesn't matter
who Detroit hires.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.346
Doesn't matter who they draft.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.116
Losing's the only thing
they know how to do.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.085
- Yeah, that's for real.
- Hey Ernie?

08:39.787 --> 08:41.188
Ernie?

08:41.321 --> 08:43.991
Did you get that
from the commissary?

08:44.124 --> 08:45.559
- Forgot my lunch.

08:45.693 --> 08:46.994
- You eat that prison shit?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.528
- Ernie, your shift
was over at seven.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.799
Who approved your OT?

08:51.932 --> 08:54.234
- I'm not on the clock.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.369
- Just what?
Fucking hanging out?

08:56.503 --> 08:58.338
- Jesus, how rough
can she be, man?

08:58.471 --> 09:00.974
- You know you've been married
a long time when you have dinner

09:01.108 --> 09:02.576
in prison just to
get some fucking peace.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.112
- Here's what I recommend,
Ernie: alcohol, all right?

09:05.245 --> 09:06.446
And lots of it.

09:06.580 --> 09:07.715
Nothing will speed you
through a marriage

09:07.848 --> 09:09.683
like a bottle of bourbon,
trust me.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.118
- Hey, man.
- [laughter]

09:11.251 --> 09:12.986
- Oh, he's just
trying to help, Ernie!

09:13.120 --> 09:14.087
- Come on, man!

09:14.221 --> 09:16.323
- Vienna sausages
for dinner, man?

09:16.456 --> 09:18.258
- Oh hey,
speaking of dinner,

09:18.391 --> 09:21.461
I wonder if P-dog enjoyed
his dinner, hm?

09:21.595 --> 09:22.830
- [chuckling]

09:22.963 --> 09:25.733
- Hey, keep your eyes
open tonight, all right?

09:25.866 --> 09:27.735
These fuck heads
are sore losers.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.370
- Just lock 'em down, Ed.
Let 'em stew in their cells.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.806
- No, no, I lock it down now
and then the warden will give me

09:32.940 --> 09:34.041
hell in November, all right?

09:34.174 --> 09:36.176
If you guys want
your Christmas overtime,

09:36.309 --> 09:37.410
we gotta wait another month

09:37.544 --> 09:39.246
before we can seal this place,
so--

09:39.379 --> 09:42.783
- Who made his dinner?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.017
- Calvin.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.519
- [laughing]

09:50.791 --> 09:52.726
- [loud clack, creak]

10:08.876 --> 10:11.378
- [toilet flushes]

10:11.511 --> 10:14.214
- GUARD: I need the bowl.
- Come fucking get it.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.816
- GUARD: Is that
really what you want?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.819

10:18.952 --> 10:23.957

Wow, you ate that fast.

10:34.968 --> 10:39.606

11:02.996 --> 11:04.732

he get two years?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.366
- DUCHARD: For nothin', man.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.468
He was just along for the ride
when they popped the driver.

11:08.601 --> 11:09.970
You know that how that go.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.105
Charge everyone in the car
for that fucking smack.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.641
- Well, doesn't matter
why he's in, Duchard.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.177
He's in.
- Ain't that the fucking truth?

11:17.310 --> 11:19.713
But look, he's clean.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.750
Fucking straight-A student
before all this shit.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.051
- He's not affiliated?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.219
- No.
But they're pushing hard.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.856
And I don't want him
caught up in all that.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.724
- All right, listen, Duchard,
in order for me to help,

11:30.858 --> 11:32.025
I need the truth.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.360
Because 16-year-old
first offenders

11:33.493 --> 11:35.528
don't go two years
for possession, okay?

11:35.662 --> 11:37.197
He's in Youth Authority?

11:37.330 --> 11:39.733
Gang members are filtered
out of general population.

11:39.867 --> 11:40.968
It's very hard to sneak through

11:41.101 --> 11:42.302
cuz they don't
wanna sneak through,

11:42.435 --> 11:43.603
because they want
to stay with their clique.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.372
That's why there's
400 kids in gang seg

11:45.505 --> 11:46.974
and 80 in general population.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.542
So which of the 79 kids
in general population

11:49.676 --> 11:51.511
is fucking worth your brother?

11:51.644 --> 11:54.347
- Why are you fucking with me?
- Because you're lying to me.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.817
That's why.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.019
Your brother,
he fucked up.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.855
And his own set's after him--
probably the one you were with.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.490
So if you just tell me what set,

12:03.623 --> 12:05.993
maybe I can do something
to help out.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.494
- Let's talk about
your fee first.

12:07.627 --> 12:08.996
That's some heavy shit.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.832
- I negotiate for you.
I don't negotiate with you.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.433
What's your brother's name?

12:13.566 --> 12:14.935
- [sighs] Tim.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.805
- Okay. I'll get into it.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.807
- When do I have to pay?
- Right now.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.274
- How do I know you did the job?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.742
- Because you won't
get a fucking phone call

12:22.876 --> 12:24.878
to identify his body.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.679
Pay Rebecca out front.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.621
- [door opens and shuts]

12:36.223 --> 12:37.357
- [door opens]

12:37.490 --> 12:39.159
- Yeah, just give me,
like, 30 seconds.

12:39.292 --> 12:43.230
- DA's office sent somebody
over here to meet with you.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.631
- Yeah. Yup.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.133
- [door opens]

12:47.767 --> 12:49.202
- Have a seat.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.703
- I'll stand, thank you.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.272
- If you stand and
you have a gun,

12:52.405 --> 12:55.375
you can pull it off
faster than I could.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.244
So...have a seat,

12:57.377 --> 12:59.712
or I'll stand up
and you don't want that.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.015
- You know who I am?
- MIKE: I do.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.616
- Then you know I
don't have a gun.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.218
- I don't put
anything past anybody.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.061
What can I do for you?

13:14.194 --> 13:15.896
- You're familiar with
my daughter's case?

13:16.029 --> 13:17.865
- She was abducted.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.432
- She wasn't abducted.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.702
She was kidnapped and killed
and god knows what else...

13:22.836 --> 13:25.438
before the fluids were
drawn from her body.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.606
- I'm sorry.

13:26.739 --> 13:30.443
I didn't realize
they found a body.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.346
- They didn't.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.647
- James Parker confess?

13:34.781 --> 13:37.650
- He confessed and retracted.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.953
Her case was never prosecuted
because there was no body.

13:44.691 --> 13:48.161
I understand your influence
within the prisons is unique.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.868
- What would you like
me to do, Mr. Shaw?

13:55.002 --> 13:56.569
- If Parker would confess
to my daughter's murder,

13:56.703 --> 13:58.338
it would mean another trial,

13:58.471 --> 14:02.575
which would mean a stay
of execution.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.644
- You sure you want that?

14:04.777 --> 14:06.546
- When he's dead,
he's done suffering.

14:06.679 --> 14:13.853
- *

14:13.987 --> 14:16.957
- Would you like a drink?
- Yeah, very much.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.363
- All right, look.
This guy's, uh, fucking insane,

14:23.496 --> 14:27.100
but he's not stupid.
Neither is his lawyer.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.702
So I'm sure he's aware
that an additional confession

14:29.836 --> 14:31.338
will get him another trial,

14:31.471 --> 14:33.406
which buys him another three
or four years per confession.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.477
So if he's the monster
they say he is,

14:37.610 --> 14:39.012
he can be there 'til he's 80.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.014
- He's the monster they say.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.252
- Then why hasn't he confessed?

14:48.455 --> 14:50.557
- That's what I need
you to find out.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.492
- Mr. Shaw, you're gonna
need a private investigator--

14:52.625 --> 14:54.894
- Private investigator doesn't
have access to every inmate in

14:55.028 --> 14:57.931
the state's penal system.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.800
The answer is inside
the walls, not outside.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.975
- I'll ask around.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.177
- How much do you charge?
- No, I won't charge for this.

15:10.310 --> 15:14.881
- [scoffs] Yeah, well, pity
isn't much of a motivator.

15:15.015 --> 15:18.751
- Money isn't much of a
motivator for me either.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.988
- Then you've never had much.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.093
- Is there a, uh...

15:26.226 --> 15:27.894
date set for execution?

15:28.028 --> 15:30.897
- It's two weeks.
- It's not enough time.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.733
- MR. SHAW: I know.
It's what you've got.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.970
- *

15:42.709 --> 15:46.213
- [seagulls squawking]

15:48.348 --> 15:52.585
- *

15:52.719 --> 15:56.956
- [siren wailing]

16:03.963 --> 16:05.932
- You see what I mean?

16:06.066 --> 16:08.001
- Oh yeah, she's beautiful.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.736
Can she dance?

16:09.869 --> 16:11.438
- No idea.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.509
- Hello, Joseph.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.212
- Take your clothes off
and get on the stage.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.914
- [giggles]
Why would I do that?

16:22.049 --> 16:23.516
- Milo wants you working.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.218
- Well, I'm not a dancer.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.755
- There are no fucking
senators in Kingstown.

16:28.888 --> 16:31.458
Hookers here walk the streets.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.626
Milo doesn't
want you doing that.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.628
Off with the dress, let's go.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.142
- [unzips]

16:49.942 --> 16:52.212
- [sighs]

17:01.954 --> 17:08.461
- *

17:12.031 --> 17:16.103
- Turn around.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.571
She's a real fucking
black widow, this one.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.910
Get on the stage.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.112
- CRAIG: Whoa, whoa, whoa...

17:25.245 --> 17:26.879
Hey, she's fucking naked, Joey.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.516
This ain't a jerk joint, honey.
Put your dress back on.

17:29.649 --> 17:34.954
- *

17:51.238 --> 17:52.839
- There we go.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.108
Well, you're fucking beautiful.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.844
And that body...

17:57.977 --> 18:00.180
But can you dance?

18:00.313 --> 18:01.614
- I understand the concept.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.216
- Yeah, there's not
much to it, is there?

18:03.350 --> 18:04.817
- I'll figure it out.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.287
- Yeah, you go through that
door and ask for Olga, okay?

18:07.420 --> 18:08.688
She'll get you taken care of.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.789
She's got all kinds of shit--

18:09.922 --> 18:11.158
dresses, heels, everything.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.893
But you gotta wear a G-string.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.263
A little mystery
goes a long way.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.932
- I think the only mysterious
thing about the human body

18:20.066 --> 18:21.568
is the eyes.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.539
Wouldn't you agree, Joseph?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.508
- [chuckles]

18:28.641 --> 18:33.112
- What did I say?
The fucking spider.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.382
- What's your name, honey?
- I'm Iris.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.851
- Iris, I am Craig.
- Craig. Nice to meet you.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.020
- My pleasure.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.692
Yeah, that door right there.
That's right.

18:47.460 --> 18:52.031
Hm. She is gonna
make a fucking fortune.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.167
- Hold back half for us.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.738
- So where's she staying?

19:00.273 --> 19:03.843
- [clears throat]

19:03.976 --> 19:05.512
Listen to me.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.081
She is poisonous, okay?
We use her to turn judges.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.251
She needs a cover,
and this is it.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.754
She is ours, so
don't fucking touch.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.155
- Hm.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.426
- Bitch will eat you alive.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.943
- [hip hop music blaring]

19:49.289 --> 19:52.825
- Look who it is!
Six-foot leprechaun.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.060
- How are you doin'?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.496
- I'm livin', baby.
- Yeah.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.665
- Cousin ain't so hot.
- Uh-huh?

19:58.798 --> 20:02.335
- Yeah, they feeding him
shit sandwiches in ad seg.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.703
My phone be blowing up, man.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.238
They complaining to me
like a motherfucker.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.539
- Well, if they're
complaining to you,

20:06.673 --> 20:07.774
then they're not
complaining about you.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.377
- No, Mike, this is serious.
- I know.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.844
- Them guards is pushin' him.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.514
If they ain't careful,
they gonna wake the beast.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.148
- At least the beast
is in the cage.

20:18.485 --> 20:22.322
- Y'all forgettin' who
run that motherfucker.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.725
They push too hard, they
gonna fucking remind you.

20:25.858 --> 20:29.862
- Look, this is not on me,
and you know it.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.531
I said this would happen.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.766
- Tell them guards to back the
fuck off before all this shit

20:33.900 --> 20:36.936
comes to a head.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.206
- Got a minute?
- Come on.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.177
- [indistinct shouting]
- [hip hop music blaring]

20:45.312 --> 20:46.946
- Duchard Little, what
do you know about him?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.247
- Yeah, I know that
rat motherfucker.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.316
- Yeah?

20:49.449 --> 20:50.817
- He got popped for the key,

20:50.950 --> 20:53.686
only spent two days in county.
Where that fool at?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.121
- He came through my office,

20:55.254 --> 20:56.889
worried about his little
brother.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.759
- Yeah, well, he
fucking should be.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.994
He got that motherfucker
thinking he quit.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.930
Saying he's in fucking
Boy Scouts, I hear? Shit.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.365
- Straight-A student, Bunny.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.900
- [laughs] Bullshit!
I got a fucking PhD, then.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.637
- No, pulled his transcript.
Look, every once in a while,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.739
someone gets scared straight,
right?

21:12.872 --> 21:14.574
Just don't bend him up, okay?

21:14.707 --> 21:15.608
- Straight A's don't
mean shit, man.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.009
He in prison.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.845
What the fuck did he
achieve with a jacket?

21:18.978 --> 21:21.981
- He's 16, Bunny.
Jacket's not gonna fall him.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.951
Just...give the kid
a chance, at least.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.286
See what he does with it.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.088
- What if something happens
to that bitch Duchard?

21:29.221 --> 21:31.824
- Fuck him, I don't care.
I care about his little brother.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.793
- Got it.
All right, then we trade.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.262
- Done. Do what you want.

21:36.396 --> 21:40.099
All right, you got, uh...

21:40.232 --> 21:43.169
Got anybody on death row
in a cell near James Parker?

21:43.302 --> 21:46.005
- [laughs] That
sick motherfucker?

21:46.138 --> 21:47.440
- Yeah.
- Goddamn!

21:47.574 --> 21:48.975
Hey, I don't understand
white people, man.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.077
Y'all won't get in a
gunfight to save your life,

21:51.210 --> 21:55.081
but y'all will sure as
fuck kill and eat 20 kids.

21:55.214 --> 21:59.285
- I need to get to him.
Favor pays top dollar.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.620
- See what I can dig up.

22:00.753 --> 22:05.358
I need a favor
from you, though. [groans]

22:05.492 --> 22:08.761
My little cousin Hakim,
he on this hockey team, right?

22:08.895 --> 22:11.831
His first game is tonight
down at the City Center.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.733
Could you run him
over there for me?

22:13.866 --> 22:15.167
- Why don't you just take him?

22:15.301 --> 22:16.636
- It's downtown, man.
You know how it is.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.270
If I drive six blocks
from here, I'mma get shot.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.772
You know this, man.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.841
The king cannot leave
the kingdom, Mike, come on.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.109
- Dude, I can't
babysit your nephew.

22:23.242 --> 22:24.911
- I ain't ask
you for nothin', come on!

22:25.044 --> 22:26.479
- All you do is ask for shit.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.080
- Well, I'm asking for some
more shit right now, then!

22:28.214 --> 22:29.949
- Okay, yes, fine, fuck!
- A'ight!

22:30.082 --> 22:33.285
- I'll do it!
- Hey, Hakim!

22:33.420 --> 22:36.823
Hey, coach his ass up on
the way over there, a'ight?

22:36.956 --> 22:38.124
He don't know a fucking
thing about hockey.

22:38.257 --> 22:39.526
- Why is he playing
hockey, then?

22:39.659 --> 22:40.893
- Why not, man? Come on.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.328
Hey, Mike gonna give
you a ride, all right?

22:42.462 --> 22:44.531
- You got your gear?
- Oh, yes, sir.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.599
- Don't call me sir.
Let's go.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.034
- [laughs]

22:48.167 --> 22:49.436
- Hey, look into that
Parker thing, would you?

22:49.569 --> 22:52.038
- I got you, man.
- Come on, kid, let's do this!

22:52.171 --> 22:53.706
- You know you're my boy, right?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.274
- Feel like your bitch.
- You're my boy.

22:55.408 --> 22:56.776
That really mean something
around here, you know that.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.445
- Yeah.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.623
So you play wing?
- Left wing, yes sir.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.391
- Don't call me sir.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.762
- What do I call you?

23:15.895 --> 23:18.197
- Just call me Mike.

23:18.330 --> 23:21.333
- So how you know my uncle?

23:21.468 --> 23:23.235
- It's a long story.

23:23.369 --> 23:25.371
- Prison?

23:25.505 --> 23:27.507
- Guess it's not
that long after all.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.108
Uh, yeah, prison.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.143
- I ain't never
goin' to prison, man.

23:31.277 --> 23:34.914
- Yeah, I don't recommend it.

23:35.047 --> 23:37.383
- I'mma play for the
Red Wings one day.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.251
You know, get
the fuck outta here.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.620
- Maybe you should
play for Tampa.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.054
- No, I hate their uniforms.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.823
- Well, Detroit's
just down the damn street.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.458
That's not getting out of here.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.727
Tampa, that's in Florida.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.763
That's getting the
fuck outta here.

23:50.897 --> 23:55.134
- Tampa Bay. Hm.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.907
- All right, Mr. Jimenez.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.342
Picked up on a bench
warrant three weeks ago.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.311
I got his bloodwork
and his urinalysis back,

24:05.444 --> 24:08.581
and surprise surprise,
narcotics are present.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.282
His parole's been revoked.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.519
I'll let his PO walk
you through the details.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.687
Officer Jefferson?

24:14.821 --> 24:18.758
- Mr. Jimenez was arrested
in 1998 for armed robbery.

24:18.891 --> 24:22.094
Got 20, which he began serving
at the Youth Authority.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.230
Transferred to the
Mall when he was 18.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.633
Racked up three manslaughter
convictions along the way.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.234
He was released in 2018

24:28.367 --> 24:30.336
when the state began its
early release initiative.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.471
- He didn't qualify for that.
He's a three-striker.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.473
- Fucking four-striker.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.643
- Ferguson, McLusky, what
the fuck are you doing here?

24:36.776 --> 24:37.977
You're supposed to be on a desk.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.046
- Yes, sir, the commissioner
appointed it

24:40.179 --> 24:42.281
because we're short staffed.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.016
- Stay at the back of the line.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.319
Last thing I need is you
cowboys in another gunfight.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.321
- Look, regardless of the
algebra that got him paroled,

24:49.455 --> 24:50.690
the failed drug test
sends him back

24:50.823 --> 24:53.025
to serve the rest of his
sentence.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.061
He owes us two decades,
and I do not expect him

24:55.194 --> 24:57.864
to go softly into the night,
gentlemen.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.532
- All right, thank you.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.834
All right, the FBI has a GPS
located on the CI that led them

25:01.968 --> 25:03.235
to Jimenez's current location.

25:03.369 --> 25:04.971
He's under surveillance now.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.139
- FBI puts GPS on
their informants?

25:07.273 --> 25:08.541
- Probably just activated
the LoJack

25:08.675 --> 25:09.742
on your brother's Lincoln.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.410
- [chuckling]

25:11.544 --> 25:16.115
- Gentlemen, focus.
His house is down an alley.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.184
They have about 30 kennels
with pit bulls

25:18.317 --> 25:20.419
behind a 7-foot
chain link fence,

25:20.553 --> 25:22.354
so we have
no element of surprise.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.624
- I put my team in a van, we
pop this moron on the street,

25:24.757 --> 25:26.993
and run our APC right through
the back wall of that house.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.661
There's your
element of surprise.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.296
- Wait 'til dark?

25:30.429 --> 25:32.198
- Middle of the day, while
these assholes are still sober.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.033
- Do it.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.635
- We run on FBI's frequency
or they run on ours?

25:35.768 --> 25:37.169
- No, no, they say your call.
- All right.

25:37.303 --> 25:40.707
- Robert? Be safe.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.576

off in the shower,

26:33.693 --> 26:35.294
your son was vomiting
across the room

26:35.427 --> 26:38.230
like he drank fucking sea water!

26:38.364 --> 26:40.700
He hasn't kept a
meal down all week.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.434
Not that you give a shit.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.270
- Well, you should
take him to the doctor.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.638
- WIFE: What's the point?

26:45.772 --> 26:47.974
Clean it up before
you go to work.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.578
Clean it the fuck up!

26:55.147 --> 26:59.018
- [game show applause]

27:03.723 --> 27:08.227
- WIFE: Gone all day!
Gone all night! Never here!

27:08.360 --> 27:11.030
You know the last time
I left this house?

27:12.699 --> 27:14.934
Me neither.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.063
That's my boy right there.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.171
- I can see the resemblance.

28:25.304 --> 28:29.041
- Should be a good game.
Good time.

We're gonna have some fun,
you and me.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.942
Knocked that little bastard
right back

where he belongs.

30:47.646 --> 30:50.149

- No?

30:50.282 --> 30:53.385
Well, you're not gonna make
any money if you don't dance.

promise of a dance.

that working out?

31:02.995 --> 31:04.730
You know, once the
novelty wears off,

31:04.863 --> 31:07.766
they're gonna want
more from you.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.703

That's my appeal.

31:11.837 --> 31:14.073
Besides, I'm spoken for.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.915

other people to fail?

reason for that to exist...

36:32.858 --> 36:35.093
do you think?

36:35.227 --> 36:36.662
- I don't know.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.764
I mean, I suppose
10,000 years ago,

36:38.897 --> 36:42.334
somebody had something
he wanted, he would just...

36:42.468 --> 36:45.036
take it, if he could.

But...but today, we just sit
here and watch other people

36:49.207 --> 36:50.676
have the things that we want,

36:50.809 --> 36:53.011
so we wish failure on each other

36:53.144 --> 36:57.649
so nobody has the thing that
we can't have for ourselves.

- Then what the fuck are we
doing in a restaurant, huh?

37:09.495 --> 37:11.263
- You can eat.

37:13.832 --> 37:17.168
- I don't want to eat, Mike.

37:17.303 --> 37:19.771
I'm just here so that we can
pretend we like each other

37:19.905 --> 37:24.209
so that you don't feel
guilty about fucking me.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.911
The thing you need to
understand is that the fact

37:26.044 --> 37:27.946
that you are the
last man on the planet

37:28.079 --> 37:30.949
that I would ever have
a relationship with

37:31.082 --> 37:35.754
is the most
attractive thing about you.

37:37.088 --> 37:42.461
So, let's just be what
we are to each other, huh?

37:42.594 --> 37:44.663
A release.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.066
- Fine with me.

37:49.868 --> 37:54.039
- [piano music plays]

37:56.575 --> 37:58.577
- Oh, come on, you're not
gonna be a dick about it.

37:58.710 --> 37:59.778
- I'm not being a dick.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.046
I just don't wanna
waste my time.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.448
- You're right.
You're not being a dick.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.249
You're being a fucking baby.

38:04.383 --> 38:07.953
- Call it what you like.
Good night.

you Superman, man!

41:33.725 --> 41:34.826
- I'm bringing
half the Irish fucking Mob

41:34.960 --> 41:36.762
to that ice rink next Friday.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.364
- Grab my boy a 40, man.
- MIKE: Fuckers.

41:40.599 --> 41:43.434
- Man, you say y'all
wanted to fight. Shit.

41:43.569 --> 41:47.405
- Oh, took me a minute
to turn the tide.

41:47.539 --> 41:49.174
- Sound like a long-ass
minute right there.

41:49.307 --> 41:51.409
- Yeah, well, one's short.

41:51.543 --> 41:54.680
- Hey, Latrell?
Somebody's light.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.850
- Fuck.

41:58.984 --> 42:01.687
- Damn, look how fucking
mad you are, bro.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.122
- Yeah.
- Shit.

42:04.255 --> 42:06.357
That little peek
through that window.

42:07.559 --> 42:09.995
See what the world
really thinks of us, huh?

42:13.231 --> 42:19.170
Hey. Thank you.

42:19.304 --> 42:22.440
- Yeah.
Do it again next Friday.

42:27.846 --> 42:30.682
Whenever I get mad,
I start thinking Mitch.

42:30.816 --> 42:32.450
I don't know why.

42:35.086 --> 42:38.690
It's a...

42:38.824 --> 42:40.258
Once I start, I can't stop.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.961
And that fucking pisses me off.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.696
- Man.

42:47.165 --> 42:50.101
I miss old Mitch, man.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.237
He was smooth.

42:52.370 --> 42:54.239
I like you though, man.
You're a asshole.

42:54.372 --> 42:57.208
You, like--you so
wound fucking tight.

42:57.342 --> 42:59.811
[laughs] Hakim said
you was chasing crackers

42:59.945 --> 43:03.882
all over the ice, swinging
a fucking hockey stick.

43:04.015 --> 43:05.717
Like it was fucking Excalibur.

43:05.851 --> 43:08.586
- Yeah, fuck them.
Those motherfuckers.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.889
- BUNNY: [laughs]

43:11.022 --> 43:12.490
- [tires screeching]

43:17.028 --> 43:21.499
- Every man in my family is dead
or in prison, except for Hakim.

43:23.468 --> 43:27.105
Unless he gonna run a 4.3...

43:27.238 --> 43:29.607
he gonna end up--
[rueful laugh]

43:29.741 --> 43:32.310
--probably dead
or in prison too.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.512
- Fuck, you really know how
to cheer a guy up, Bunny.

43:36.181 --> 43:39.651
- BUNNY: Well, for 500 years,

43:39.785 --> 43:42.220
running fast is
the only thing that can--

43:42.353 --> 43:44.155
that can free a black man.

43:44.289 --> 43:49.560
But slavery ended 150 years ago.

43:51.496 --> 43:54.332
And it's still the only
thing that frees a black man.

43:56.301 --> 43:57.135
And that shit
ain't even freedom.

43:57.268 --> 44:00.772
That's just...

44:00.906 --> 44:02.741
Just the money.

44:07.012 --> 44:10.115
I wish they'd just fucking turn
off these street lamps just once

44:10.248 --> 44:13.051
so I can see the
fucking stars, man.

44:13.184 --> 44:15.687
I look up at the sky
and it's just mud.

44:15.821 --> 44:21.326
- You know, in my cabin,
you can see so many stars.

44:21.459 --> 44:23.594
You can see the sky.

44:23.729 --> 44:26.965
I stare and it...
it makes me dizzy.

44:27.098 --> 44:29.234
- You know, like,
all that, uh...

44:29.367 --> 44:31.737
all that astrology shit?

44:31.870 --> 44:33.939
Like, what the stars are called?

44:34.072 --> 44:35.106
The names and all that?

44:35.240 --> 44:36.842
- Some of it.

44:36.975 --> 44:38.643
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.982
That's, that's...

44:44.115 --> 44:46.417
That's Orion's Constellation.

44:46.551 --> 44:51.556
- BUNNY: Right here, with
the three and the--okay.

44:51.689 --> 44:55.293
- You know, it's something
interesting to think about.

44:58.463 --> 45:02.734
These archeologists
find this ivory carving

45:02.868 --> 45:04.669
in a cave in Germany.

45:04.803 --> 45:08.940
And they date it back
to 38,000 years ago.

45:09.074 --> 45:12.377
- Damn.
- MIKE: Right?

45:12.510 --> 45:15.881
And that carving is of

45:16.014 --> 45:20.085
that constellation right there.

45:20.218 --> 45:22.687
- That right there?
- MIKE: Uh-huh.

45:22.821 --> 45:28.193
So we're looking at what
they saw 38,000 years ago.

45:33.231 --> 45:35.566
- How about that
shit right there?

45:35.700 --> 45:38.136
Or that?
- I think that's Taurus.

45:38.269 --> 45:39.971
- Taurus?
- Yeah.

45:40.105 --> 45:50.982
- *

45:51.116 --> 45:55.086
* Hm *

45:55.220 --> 45:57.188
* Ooh, ooh *

46:06.965 --> 46:08.599
- They broke their word, Mike!

46:08.733 --> 46:09.935
- MIKE: Sure you
want to start a war?

46:10.068 --> 46:11.937
- BUNNY: I don't make this call.

46:12.070 --> 46:13.204
- They created this situation

46:13.338 --> 46:15.273
when they made a deal
they won't keep.

46:15.406 --> 46:18.209
- Three thousand prisoners
think that they're in the right.

46:18.343 --> 46:21.146
- We can't bend!
We gotta push until they break!

46:21.279 --> 46:23.949
- MIKE: I don't think
they're breaking this time.

46:24.082 --> 46:27.352
- This is leaving prison
and going to the street.

46:27.485 --> 46:32.223
- *

46:35.660 --> 46:42.868
- *

46:57.048 --> 46:59.417
**

47:02.220 --> 47:04.655
