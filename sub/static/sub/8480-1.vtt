38:30.542 --> 38:34.045
I CUT THIS GUY'S SKULL OPEN
WITH A HACKSAW.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.447
[WHEEZES]

38:35.447 --> 38:38.450
I WAS STARIN'
AT THIS BOY'S BRAIN.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.587
I WAS THINKIN',
HE DOESN'T NEED THIS THING.

38:41.587 --> 38:45.657
ANYONE STUPID ENOUGH
TO TRY TO JAM ME UP

38:45.657 --> 38:49.461
MUST NOT HAVE MUCH USE
FOR HIS BRAIN.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.432
SO, I TOOK IT.

38:55.367 --> 38:58.036
I DID. I KEEP IT
IN THE FREEZER.

38:58.036 --> 39:01.440
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
I CUT OFF A SLICE

39:01.440 --> 39:03.975
AND I MIX IT UP
WITH MY--

39:03.975 --> 39:05.444
MY DINNER

39:05.444 --> 39:08.747
OR MY BREAKFAST.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.889
10,000 A POUND.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.591
[WHEEZES]

39:22.728 --> 39:24.896

39:25.964 --> 39:30.235
HEY, HANG ON. 9,000.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

39:30.235 --> 39:31.369
I'LL LEAVE IT.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.705
UH, 8'S AS HIGH AS I GO.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.474
ALL RIGHT. OKAY, 8'S GOOD.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.876
8 SOUNDS GOOD THERE,
DANNY BOY.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.846
8'S WHERE I WAS GOING.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.549

39:50.622 --> 39:53.992
POOH-BEAR LIKES THAT

39:55.594 --> 39:58.497
HEY, HANG ON A SECOND!

40:08.239 --> 40:09.741

40:14.880 --> 40:15.947

40:19.350 --> 40:21.553
DANNY, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

40:21.553 --> 40:22.688
SURE.

40:22.688 --> 40:26.658
UM, WHAT DOES JFK
STAND FOR?

40:26.658 --> 40:28.827
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY.

40:28.827 --> 40:31.830
AND HE WAS THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES?

40:31.830 --> 40:33.098
YEAH.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.866
AND HE WAS KILLED?

40:37.268 --> 40:39.705
THEY ASSASSINATED HIM.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.810
HEY, DANNY.

40:44.810 --> 40:48.680
THANKS FOR
NOT LAUGHING AT ME.

40:52.484 --> 40:56.421
* HOLLY CAME FROM MIAMI,
F-L-A *

40:56.421 --> 40:59.190

A WEEK FROM THIS FRIDAY.

41:07.432 --> 41:08.534
Jimmy: IS IT DRUGS?

41:08.534 --> 41:09.735
BETTER THAN DRUGS.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.803
IT'S BOB HOPE'S
STOOL SPECIMEN.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.138
WE'RE GONNA BOOST IT.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.272

SO WE CAN SELL IT.

41:20.411 --> 41:21.947

Nancy: EBAY.

41:21.947 --> 41:24.816
I DON'T KNOW. A COLLECTOR.
FUCKIN'-A, IT'S BOB HOPE.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.752
HE'S A FUCKIN'
NATIONAL TREASURE.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.620
Kujo: RIGHT.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.722
OKAY, SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S LIKE RUM AND COKE?

41:43.001 --> 41:45.303
Kujo: DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

41:45.303 --> 41:47.238

41:47.238 --> 41:48.540

45:10.641 --> 45:13.711

45:17.182 --> 45:18.917
YES, IT IS.

45:22.587 --> 45:25.123
WHAT'S THIS?

45:25.123 --> 45:26.424
HMM.

45:26.424 --> 45:28.393
YOU WERE MARRIED, HUH?

45:31.529 --> 45:33.899
WAS SHE EVERYTHING TO YOU?

45:36.501 --> 45:38.269

46:30.488 --> 46:32.357
CASH ON THE BARREL HEAD.

46:32.357 --> 46:33.992
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

46:33.992 --> 46:36.127
NO. WHAT THE FUCK YOU

46:37.662 --> 46:39.564
I MEAN, THIS GUY'S READY.
I TOLD HIM YOU WERE READY.

46:39.564 --> 46:42.000
HE'S GONNA THINK I'M A LIAR.

YOU'RE IN A VERY
TENUOUS POSITION

46:58.516 --> 47:00.551
ON THE FOOD CHAIN...

47:00.551 --> 47:02.287
HOSS.

47:04.122 --> 47:06.524
HE'S NOT GONNA LIKE THIS.
I'LL TAKE IT TO HIM, BUT...

47:43.561 --> 47:45.596

BY YOURSELF, HUH?

47:45.596 --> 47:47.398
I DON'T KNOW.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.970

47:51.970 --> 47:54.039
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO DO A GOOD SCORE

47:54.039 --> 47:55.173
SO I COULD GET LOST.

47:55.173 --> 47:56.707
I'M SUPPOSED

48:10.455 --> 48:12.423
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I'LL CALL THE DUDE,

48:12.423 --> 48:14.592
I'LL TELL HIM IT'S OVER,

48:14.592 --> 48:18.596
WRONG, PAL. YOU'RE GONNA
ROLL OVER ON THESE GUYS.

48:18.596 --> 48:20.131
WHAT ARE YOU

48:20.131 --> 48:22.300
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:14.458
YOU'RE NOT DYING.
YOU'RE RIGHT HERE.

01:03:17.594 --> 01:03:19.296
LISTEN.

01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:25.302
I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING GOOD.

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:29.073
I WANT TO HELP YOU
WITH QUINCY.

01:03:29.073 --> 01:03:31.408
YOU CAN'T HELP ME
WITH QUINCY.

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:34.744
YES, THERE'S
SOMETHING I CAN DO.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.480
COME ON.

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:45.289
HERE, TAKE THIS.

01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:49.026
I CAN'T TAKE THAT.

01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:50.760
NO, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.899
LOOK, THIS IS
MY PAGER NUMBER.

01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:57.467
YOU TAKE THIS BAG
AND HIDE IT

01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:59.136
SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW
HE CAN'T FIND IT.

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:01.038
WHEN YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA
BE THERE FOR A WHILE,

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:03.373
PAGE ME, AND THEN
LEAVE THE APARTMENT.

01:04:03.373 --> 01:04:04.608
WHY?

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:06.210
I'M GONNA HAVE SOME
GUYS COME OVER.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.711
THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:08.845
YOU WON'T SEE HIM
ANYMORE.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.014
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

01:04:10.014 --> 01:04:11.648
IT'S OKAY.
THESE GUYS ARE COPS.

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:13.283
I WORK WITH THEM.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:14.952
LOOK, I MESSED UP
EVERYTHING.

01:04:14.952 --> 01:04:16.053
YOU CAN FIX THIS.

01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:18.855
DO IT
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:32.402
Quincy: YO, MAN,
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING!

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:34.604
GET THESE CUFFS
OFF ME, MAN!

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.206
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
READ ME MY RIGHTS!

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:40.077
YOU FUCKIN' DEAF?
I'M FUCKIN' TALKIN' TO YOU!

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:41.411
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:42.712
Danny: BUBBA.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:43.948
Bubba: YES?

01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:45.549
YOU GET THE MONEY?

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:46.783
YEP.

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:50.154
OKAY. JUST MAKE SURE
YOU COME ALONE

01:04:50.154 --> 01:04:52.789
'CAUSE POOH-BEAR
DOESN'T LIKE SURPRISES.

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:55.792
I AIN'T AN IDIOT,
ASSHOLE.

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:58.362
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:01.365
Morgan: OH, A MAN
OF FEW WORDS.

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:04.234
Garcetti: WHAT'S UP?
YOU NERVOUS?

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.436
WITH YOU TWO CLOWNS
WATCHING MY BACK?

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:08.372
REMEMBER, MAKE SURE
YOU HIT THE FLOOR

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:12.109
WHEN WE COME IN, OKAY?
COULD GET UGLY IN THERE.

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:15.112
YEAH, WE DON'T TO ACCIDENTALLY
SHOOT YOU OR ANYTHING.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.046
HOW'D IT GO?

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:51.215
YOU TELL ME.

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:54.551
YOU READY TO GO
MEET THE TEAM?

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:57.654
WELL, GET IN, HOSS.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:14.138
ALL RIGHT, FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO DON'T KNOW,

01:06:14.138 --> 01:06:15.905
THIS IS TOM VAN ALLEN,

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:18.642
AKA DANNY PARKER.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:20.144
AROUND A YEAR AGO,

01:06:20.144 --> 01:06:22.446
MR. VAN ALLEN'S WIFE
WAS MURDERED

01:06:22.446 --> 01:06:24.848
IN A METH LAB OUT NEAR
THE SALTON SEA.

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:27.451
NO ONE WAS EVER APPREHENDED
FOR THE CRIME.

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:29.453
LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE
ALWAYS ASSUMED

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:31.155
THAT IT WAS A STANDARD
HOME INTRUSION

01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:33.423
PERPETRATED
BY RIVAL DRUG DEALERS.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:35.525
THAT IS UNTIL TOM HERE
TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:38.528
TO CONDUCT A ONE-MAN
UNDERCOVER OPERATION,

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:41.798
AT GREAT RISK TO HIS OWN
PERSONAL SAFETY.

01:06:41.798 --> 01:06:43.067
HE'S A CIVILIAN?

01:06:43.067 --> 01:06:46.336
YEAH, HE'S A CIVILIAN.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.438
HOW THE HELL DID YOU
PULL THIS OFF?

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.341
Bookman: YOU SAID
YOU SAW ONE OF

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:53.110
THE PERPETRATORS CROSS
IN FRONT OF YOU?

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.479
NO, I WAS IN
THE BATHROOM. THEY--

01:06:55.479 --> 01:06:59.015
WHAT? IN THE HOUSE?
WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE?

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.753
IN THE HOUSE.

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.922
DID YOU, UH...

01:07:05.922 --> 01:07:08.024
SEE HAIR COLOR?

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.128
THEY HAD MASKS ON.
I DIDN'T SEE.

01:07:11.128 --> 01:07:13.897
WELL, FORENSICS FOUND
THIS RED HAIR

01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:16.666
ON YOUR WIFE'S BODY.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:19.403
Danny: THAT'S HOW
IT STARTED.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.740
WE HAD STOPPED FOR GAS
AT THE SALTON SEA.

01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:28.345
I HAD SEEN A MAN
WITH RED HAIR.

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:34.318
IT WAS THE RING
THAT DREW MY ATTENTION.

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:37.721
I KNEW THE RING.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.957
WHAT IS IT?

01:07:40.957 --> 01:07:43.293
NOTHING, I...

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:45.995
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL HIM?

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:48.298
I WANTED TO
FIND HIM MYSELF.

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:51.735
I WANTED TO KILL HIM.

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:53.203
SO WHAT ABOUT
THE RING?

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:56.640
Danny:
IT WAS A COLLEGE RING--

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.175
CENTRAL VALLEY,

01:07:58.175 --> 01:07:59.776
WHERE MY FATHER
ONCE TAUGHT MUSIC.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:05.615
I TRACKED HIM TO THE L.A.
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:07.551
I WOULD'VE KILLED HIM
RIGHT THERE,

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:10.720
BUT I HAD TO BE POSITIVE.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.056
AND EVEN IF MORGAN
WAS INVOLVED,

01:08:13.056 --> 01:08:15.225
I HAD TO BE SURE
ABOUT GARCETTI,

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:17.627
SO I BECAME
DANNY PARKER.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.662
Garcetti:
SON OF A BITCH!

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.631
SON OF A BITCH!

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:24.100
WHAT THE FUCK?

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:30.840
I DROPPED MYSELF
RIGHT IN THEIR LAPS.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.678
MORGAN.

01:08:34.678 --> 01:08:36.045
WELL, WELL.

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:39.716
I WAS A PERFECT RAT.

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:41.484
I DID WHATEVER
THEY WANTED.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:44.720
I GAVE UP
WHOEVER THEY ASKED FOR,

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.857
BUT I KNEW I HAD TO
GO FURTHER.

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:51.194
I HAD TO GET CLOSER.

01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:56.765
I NEEDED A BIG BUYER.

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.468
IT WOULD BE
A PERFECT SET UP,

01:08:58.468 --> 01:08:59.669
ONE THAT I KNEW
THEY WOULD HIT

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:02.671
EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T
INCLUDE ME.

01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:06.410
BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.877
THAT'S WHEN
HE CALLED ME.

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:11.648
WE HAD ONE OF OUR C.I.s
CALL MORGAN AND GARCETTI

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.383
WITH AND ANONYMOUS TIP
ABOUT THE DEAL.

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:15.551
Garcetti: CAN YOU BELIEVE
THIS WEASEL-FACED PRICK

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.354
TRYING TO PULL THIS
OFF WITHOUT US?

01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:19.288
MOTHERFUCKER.

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:21.925
I DUMPED A DUMMY FILE
INTO THE SYSTEM.

01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:25.795
Morgan: WE GOT THE 411
ON YOUR GOOD OLD BOY.

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:28.698
APPEARS TO BE A MAJOR
TRAFFICKER IN TEXAS,

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:32.167
AND HE JUMPED BAIL ON
A MURDER CHARGE LAST APRIL.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.304
MURDER, BEAUTIFUL.

01:09:34.304 --> 01:09:36.640
PUMPED 57 SLUGS
INTO A POLICE INFORMANT.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.643
Bubba: THEY TOOK THE BAIT,
AND WE WERE OFF TO THE RACES.

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:40.743
Agent:
THIS IS BULLSHIT.

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:42.145
THIS GUY'S
A FUCKING RAT.

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:43.313
HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOU'RE NOT JUST

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:44.381
JAMMING IT
UP THE TRAIL

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:45.715
OF 2 PERFECTLY
GOOD COPS?

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:48.551
ALL YOU REALLY HAVE
IS ONE RED HAIR.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.185
IT'S STILL
YOUR ONLY EVIDENCE.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:51.555
NOT ANYMORE.

01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:53.457
WE TAPPED THESE GUYS'
PHONES AND COMPUTERS

01:09:53.457 --> 01:09:55.124
AT THE L.A. SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT.

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:57.261
MORGAN AND GARCETTI
HAVE NOT FILED

01:09:57.261 --> 01:09:58.728
ONE REPORT
ON THIS DEAL.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:01.531
THEY HAVE NOT COORDINATED
WITH THE PALMDALE P.D.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:04.167
THEY ARE KEEPIN' IT
OFF THE BOOKS.

01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:07.937
NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
THE RIGHT GUYS.

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:12.008
WE'LL FIND OUT
FOR SURE TONIGHT.

01:10:12.008 --> 01:10:14.944
BUBBA, JESUS, THEY
CALLED ME A FUCKIN' RAT.

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.045
THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:17.381
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS GET POOH-BEAR

01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:19.215
TO MEET
AT THE TROPIC MOTEL.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.117
EVERYTHING'S GONNA
WORK OUT FINE, HOSS.

01:10:21.117 --> 01:10:22.986
LOOK, UM...

01:10:27.491 --> 01:10:29.293
AW, COME ON, NOW.

01:10:29.293 --> 01:10:31.561
YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING HERE.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.830
I DON'T SEE
YOU HAVE ANY CHOICE.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:37.066
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD
A CHANCE WITH THOSE BOYS.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.835
I NEED YOU
TO DO YOUR PART,

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:42.038
AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD
THAT I'LL DO MINE.

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:44.641
I'M COUNTIN' ON YOU.

01:10:47.344 --> 01:10:50.179
CATCH.

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.315
OHH.

01:10:51.315 --> 01:10:52.882
IT'S $10,000.

01:10:52.882 --> 01:10:55.585
OOH!

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:57.186
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
IS WORTH MORE,

01:10:57.186 --> 01:10:59.523
BUT IT'S ALL I--
ALL I COULD GET.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:03.360
NO, YOU ONLY OWE ME 5.
THAT'S NOT TILL AFTER

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.430
WE CLOSE
THE DEAL TONIGHT.

01:11:08.632 --> 01:11:10.400
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:14.571
I WANT YOU TO DO ME
A SOLID INSTEAD.

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:15.605
OKAY.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.674
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT IT IS FIRST.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:19.142
NO, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I'LL DO IT,

01:11:19.142 --> 01:11:21.645
AND YOU SURE AS HELL
DON'T HAVE TO PAY ME.

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:22.879
WHY?

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:24.748
LIKE, YOU'RE
MY BEST FRIEND.

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:27.150
I'D DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU.

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.352
JIMMY--
WAIT.

01:11:28.352 --> 01:11:29.453
LISTEN, LISTEN--

01:11:29.453 --> 01:11:31.488
YOU READY?
NO, LISTEN--

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:33.222
YOU READY?
COME ON, BE READY.

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.124
LISTEN--
CHECK THAT OUT.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.192
WHAT IS THAT?

01:11:36.192 --> 01:11:38.862
IT'S YOU. SEE?

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:40.364
CHECK IT OUT.

01:11:40.364 --> 01:11:43.099
I, LIKE--I DIDN'T HAVE
A PICTURE OR NOTHIN',

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:44.368
SO I DESCRIBED YOU
TO THE GUY,

01:11:44.368 --> 01:11:46.403
BUT HE DID A PRETTY
GOOD JOB, RIGHT?

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:48.838
YOU LIKE IT?

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:50.340
IT ROCKS, MAN.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:53.076
YEAH, SERIOUSLY?

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:54.210
I KNOW IT'S
A LITTLE WEIRD.

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:55.244
NO.
IT'S ALL RIGHT?

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.780
YOU'RE INSANE.
OH, MY GOD,

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.848
IT'LL BE SO FUCKIN'
A-PLUS AFTER TONIGHT.

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:00.116
SERIOUSLY.

01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:01.918
WE'RE GONNA LAY OUT
LIKE A MILE OF CRANK,

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:03.219
AND YOU START
AT THIS END,

01:12:03.219 --> 01:12:04.421
AND I'LL START
AT THIS END.

01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:06.890
JIMMY, JIMMY, JIMMY,

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.392
QUIT THAT SHIT.

01:12:08.392 --> 01:12:09.593
WHAT?

01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:11.795
I QUIT, JIMMY.
I JUST--

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:13.530
I CAME OVER HERE
TO TELL YOU

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:17.000
I'M GOING STRAIGHT
AND TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.902
WHAT?
