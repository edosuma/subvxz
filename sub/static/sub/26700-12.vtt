WEBVTT

00:00.751 --> 00:02.211
Previously on Legacies...

00:02.211 --> 00:03.629
How am I supposed
to protect them

00:03.629 --> 00:07.174
from stuff
that's not supposed to exist?

00:07.174 --> 00:09.510
LIZZIE:
Hope got bamboozled
by one of the monsters,

00:09.510 --> 00:11.637
and now only two keys separate

00:11.637 --> 00:13.805
the entire supernatural
community from being consumed

00:13.805 --> 00:15.057
by a hell portal.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.058
Say, what's going on here?

00:16.058 --> 00:17.351
CLARKE:
A gas leak.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.186
Don't worry, though,
we have it under control.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.605
Would you like to get dinner
with me sometime?

00:21.605 --> 00:24.983
I just started seeing someone.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.401
Mind-control slugs.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.070
ALARIC: We're totally infected,
aren't we?

00:30.781 --> 00:32.115
I hate that urn.

00:32.115 --> 00:35.160
So I'm just gonna get rid of it.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.253
All right.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.505
To you.

00:46.505 --> 00:47.881
A week off.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.801
And a break from
monster-related business.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.428
Hear, hear.
And... (gasps)

00:54.513 --> 00:56.223
Oh!

00:56.223 --> 00:57.474
I detest creepy crawlies.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.935
(laughs)
You had a mind-
control slug

00:59.935 --> 01:02.854
in your brain,
but a beetle freaks you out.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.731
It's a childhood fear.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.901
So, have you decided
if you're gonna

01:07.901 --> 01:09.236
come to the mountains
with me for spring break?

01:09.236 --> 01:12.072
Does it look like I know
how to pitch a tent?

01:12.072 --> 01:13.907
No, it does not,

01:13.907 --> 01:15.742
Miss "High Heels
at a Picnic."
(laughs)

01:15.742 --> 01:18.078
Which is why I
booked us at an inn.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.664
Because, you know,
psychologically speaking,

01:20.664 --> 01:23.667
you wouldn't have worn
those shoes

01:23.667 --> 01:25.085
if you didn't like me a little.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.504
(laughs)

01:30.924 --> 01:33.343
(screaming)

01:33.343 --> 01:35.387
DORIAN:
Let's get out of here,
come on, come on.

01:35.387 --> 01:37.806
Okay... all right...

01:40.100 --> 01:42.436
(screaming)

02:00.912 --> 02:02.831
I couldn't find it.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.166
'Cause it's not there.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.126
Then why have I done five dives
looking for it?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.045
I didn't figure it out till now.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.838
When's the last
time you slept?

02:09.838 --> 02:13.133
Oh, man, I will get some sleep
when we find this damn urn.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.926
Look, you've got to stop

02:14.926 --> 02:16.386
beating yourself
up about this.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.472
I mean, yes, throwing
an extremely dangerous

02:18.472 --> 02:20.307
magical artifact
into the river was

02:20.307 --> 02:22.184
pretty stupid.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.727
The slug made you do it.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.355
Slug or not, I am responsible
for the things I do,

02:26.355 --> 02:29.107
and I have very likely unleashed
a new monster on the humans

02:29.107 --> 02:30.942
that live outside the gates
of the school,

02:30.942 --> 02:32.235
so I need to clean up this mess.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.862
Look, I've been searching
for things

02:33.862 --> 02:35.280
outside the ordinary.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.866
Sandstorms, locusts,

02:37.866 --> 02:39.993
scorpions...
and then all of a sudden,

02:39.993 --> 02:41.411
this attack
that happened to you.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.996
Dorian, these are mini plagues.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.708
The river must've swept
the urn downstream.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.876
And these plagues
are a harbinger

02:47.876 --> 02:49.086
of whatever monster's come
for it.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.922
Mm-hmm.
Ten bucks I know what it is.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.466
I'm way ahead of you.
Now, if my theory is correct,

02:54.466 --> 02:56.718
the urn is here.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.429
It's a man-made reservoir.
A dam.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.889
Which would have
trapped the urn.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.349
Exactly.

03:02.349 --> 03:06.686
So pack your flippers, Dorian.
We're going on a road trip.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.107
But I was supposed to...

03:11.650 --> 03:14.236
...skip my mountain getaway
with Emma

03:14.236 --> 03:16.488
and help you
fight evil.

03:16.488 --> 03:19.408
Hey, listen, man,
I'm really sorry to harsh

03:19.408 --> 03:20.450
your romantic weekend.

03:20.450 --> 03:24.329
(sighs) Don't worry about it.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.665
I'll just invite her
to come with us.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.419
Sure.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.628
You want me to go where?

03:31.628 --> 03:33.755
Maple Hollows.
It'll be fun.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.508
You're the one who didn't want
to go home for spring break.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.385
That's 'cause my family's
crazy, man.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.469
It's the same
thing every year.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.679
A barbecue, a game of spades,

03:40.679 --> 03:42.305
and then my uncle's
throwing hands.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.849
Do you think I want to trade
my family drama for yours?

03:43.849 --> 03:47.519
I think you want unsupervised
time to feed on humans.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.941
Okay, so now we get to the real.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.317
You still don't trust me.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.987
Right now? Not as far
as I can throw you.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.321
Look, MG doesn't need

03:58.321 --> 04:00.198
any negative influences
while I'm gone.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.700
So come with me.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.618
All you have to do
is follow my rules.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.370
There's rules now?
Yeah, they're simple.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.706
No using vampire powers...

04:07.706 --> 04:09.291
and absolutely...

04:09.291 --> 04:11.376
no using vampire powers.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.086
Look, I do this,
you'll get off my back?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.713
Nothing would make me happier.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.632
(sighs) All right.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.675
Whatever.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.886
But... if we're going
to some Podunk town, you know,

04:20.886 --> 04:23.054
we can't roll up in that
slick-ass Salvatore bus.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.473
We got to stay low-key.

So mission accomplished.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.368
You guys are just talking
about ancient history.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.620
Ow!

09:38.620 --> 09:40.246
Something stung me.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.831
Ew.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.458
Gross.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.502
How'd I get stuck on the senior
citizens' half of the tour?

09:45.502 --> 09:46.878
Excuse me...

09:46.878 --> 09:48.338
Or y'all just needed
a third wheel

09:48.338 --> 09:50.381
to shield you
from all this awkwardness.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.050
We're not awkward.
Not awkward at all.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.635
No one's awkward.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.971
Hold up.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.264
I'm trying to hear something.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.518
I said no vampire powers.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.269
(whispers): We're trying to
keep a low profile here.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.396
I can't turn my ears off, bruh.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.815
It's so faint.

10:06.815 --> 10:12.111
Maybe like a... a generator?
On the edge of town?

10:14.072 --> 10:16.825
I don't know, but...

10:16.825 --> 10:18.868
something's humming for sure.

10:18.868 --> 10:22.539
(loud buzzing)

10:22.539 --> 10:23.623
That's no generator.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.209
Run. Run.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.545
Run!
(screaming)

10:30.046 --> 10:32.423
This is plague-y, right?
It seems plague-y.

10:32.423 --> 10:36.010
(screaming)

10:36.010 --> 10:37.887
It's plague-y.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.223
Get in the van.
Get in the van!

10:43.393 --> 10:46.062
Go, go, go, go, go!
Whoo!

10:46.062 --> 10:47.397
(all exhaling)

10:47.397 --> 10:49.274
Guess we're in the right place.
Yeah.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.363
These hornets,
they're indigenous to Africa,

10:55.363 --> 10:57.490
or Southwest Asia.
I mean, they shouldn't even

10:57.490 --> 10:59.284
be on this continent.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.412
You're literally getting
geekier by the minute, Dr. S.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.831
Oh... what are
they doing here?

11:04.831 --> 11:07.166
Oh, you guys, it's so obvious,
you're gonna kick yourselves.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.586
I can't do this. I simply can't.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.881
I can't do it. (whimpers)
Creepy crawlies. I hate them.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.341
Whoa, look.
If I could look,

11:15.341 --> 11:16.926
I wouldn't be covering
my eyes, Kaleb.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.929
No, they all
just... died.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.224
(screaming)

11:25.518 --> 11:27.145
What?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.779
We need to find your dad.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.406
This way.

11:38.406 --> 11:42.285
Does this way take us
past the fire station?

11:42.285 --> 11:44.996
Oh, my God. We barely just
survived a biblical plague.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.706
For the last time,
I didn't start that fire,

11:46.706 --> 11:48.333
and I've never ruined
a spring break.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.084
Yeah, Lizzie,
now's not the time.
LIZZIE: Fifth grade.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.961
You callously gave me the flu
while we were building

11:51.961 --> 11:53.546
our float for
witch week.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.925
With global warming, I may
never see the Florida Keys.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.092
That's on you.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.802
We built it with Alyssa Chang,

11:59.802 --> 12:01.387
who had pneumonia
over spring break.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.389
It wasn't me,
and neither was that fire.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.391
Um, hey...
LIZZIE: Why did I
see you giving us

12:05.391 --> 12:07.185
a death glare
through the window?

12:07.185 --> 12:09.312
There's a boil on my boil.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.980
Oh, God!
Ew!

12:10.980 --> 12:12.649
I think I'm gonna be sick again.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.400
Pick up the pace, Mikaelson.
(snapping fingers)

12:14.400 --> 12:16.986
My sister needs...
MAN: Single file.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.406
You're going to be safe.
Get on the buses.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.616
...medical attention?

12:28.122 --> 12:31.000
WOMAN (over P.A.): Please form
an orderly single file line

12:31.000 --> 12:34.837
and proceed to the triage tent
for processing.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.385
Deposit your cellular devices
with a representative.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.971
Keep moving.
Stick together. Uh-huh.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.936
Please form an orderly
single file line

12:49.936 --> 12:52.981
and proceed to the triage tent
for processing.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.565
I don't get it.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.235
The locals that we met said
that they hadn't seen anything,

12:57.235 --> 12:58.611
which means that
the first sign

12:58.611 --> 13:00.571
of trouble happened
after we got here.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.658
How did these people
get here before the bugs?

13:03.658 --> 13:06.494
I don't know who they are,
but they are too prepared,

13:06.494 --> 13:08.705
organized, and well-equipped
to be responding

13:08.705 --> 13:10.373
to some random
insect attack.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.458
You together?

13:12.458 --> 13:14.085
ALARIC: Yeah, you know,
we just came in

13:14.085 --> 13:17.797
from Roanoke to see that giant
ball of yarn you guys have.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.631
And these are?

13:18.631 --> 13:21.884
This is my wife...
(laughs)

13:21.884 --> 13:23.219
Emma. Uh...

13:23.219 --> 13:25.054
these are my daughters.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.140
From my first marriage.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.267
And, uh, Kaleb
here is, uh...

13:29.267 --> 13:30.518
My boyfriend.
My boyfriend.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.314
Hey... (chuckles) when you're
good, you're good, right?

14:05.887 --> 14:07.263
Don't look,

14:07.263 --> 14:09.140
but that guy over there
was outside of Seylah's house

14:09.140 --> 14:11.976
when we were in Kansas,
with the fake gas leak.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.978
I said don't look.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.897
What's he doing here?

14:15.897 --> 14:17.732
I don't know. Probably
the same thing we were.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.776
Trying to cover
things up.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.944
There are groups like this
scattered all over the globe.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.322
Probably tracking the
same activity we were.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.910
HOPE:
Awful lot of artillery, too.

14:28.910 --> 14:32.121
WOMAN: ...and proceed to the
triage tent for processing.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.915
Dr. Saltzman, their gear.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.795
They're here
for the urn.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.463
Dorian...

14:57.355 --> 14:58.856
We'll take that.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.025
Finders keepers.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.030
Now.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.450
(loud buzzing)

15:13.329 --> 15:15.832
(screaming)

15:26.217 --> 15:29.512
(groaning)

15:50.116 --> 15:52.827
(growls)

15:57.498 --> 15:59.500
(growls)

16:06.924 --> 16:08.050
(growling)

16:49.217 --> 16:51.344
(indistinct radio chatter)

17:03.981 --> 17:05.691
Oh, poor Emma.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.194
I mean, she's worried
sick about Dorian.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.239
Got to find a way
to put her mind at ease.

17:11.239 --> 17:15.451
You more pressed about
your friend or the girl?

17:15.451 --> 17:16.911
Both.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.162
Mm-hmm.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.789
Listen, we need to snag
one of our phones back

17:19.789 --> 17:22.750
so we can
call Dorian. I was...

17:22.750 --> 17:24.252
wondering if maybe
you could help.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.838
What? Huh? You-- (chuckles)

17:27.838 --> 17:30.716
I thought vampire powers
were off-limits.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.926
Desperate times.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.553
All right. I'll lend you
a hand, but, um,

17:34.553 --> 17:36.430
I want to hear you say it.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.642
(chuckles) Not a chance.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.102
Whatever, though.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.817
Hi, there.

17:47.817 --> 17:51.028
Hello.
I'm Deputy
Agent Clarke.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.697
I apologize for
the inconvenience.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.573
I see you're
from Richmond?

17:54.573 --> 17:56.117
Uh, Roanoke.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.452
I'm just checking in with
everyone. Sooner we get everyone

17:58.452 --> 17:59.745
proper medical
attention,

17:59.745 --> 18:01.455
sooner you can go see
that giant ball of yarn.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.541
(laughs) Well, we, uh,
don't need any attention,

18:03.541 --> 18:05.126
but thank you.

18:05.126 --> 18:09.588
So you came in from Raleigh
on a road trip with your family?

18:09.588 --> 18:12.925
Roanoke.
Roanoke. Sorry.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.804
You ever been to Kansas?

18:19.640 --> 18:21.183
Hey, who is that guy?

18:21.183 --> 18:24.353
This creep we met in Kansas
when you guys were in Europe.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.565
Why were you in Kansas?
Oh, wait, let me guess,

18:27.565 --> 18:29.734
it involved you
insinuating yourself

18:29.734 --> 18:32.737
into a situation where
only you could be the hero.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.322
As a matter of fact, yeah.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.366
I swear to God, you will do
anything to get attention.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.784
(scoffs) Said
the narcissist.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.953
Said the... other narcissist.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.580
Okay, guys, can we
please just stop?

18:42.580 --> 18:45.124
Okay, fine.
You know what?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.709
Maybe I was jealous.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.753
Maybe I wanted
what you had.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.963
A simple day
with my family.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.007
I lost half of my stuff
in that fire,

18:53.007 --> 18:55.760
including the only painting
I made with my dad.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.928
Why would I do
that to myself?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.476
So if there's nothing else...

19:03.476 --> 19:04.977
Actually, uh, I was

19:04.977 --> 19:06.937
hoping we could
talk privately.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.231
You and your
daughter, uh,

19:09.231 --> 19:11.025
Jessica, was it?

19:12.401 --> 19:14.779
I don't think we have
anything more to discuss.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.864
I could think of a few things.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.201
Mystic Falls, maybe?

19:21.744 --> 19:24.997
Or perhaps your school
for supernatural children.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.796
I work for an organization
that keeps monsters

19:31.796 --> 19:34.215
and things that go bump
in the night from public view.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.759
I thought I recognized
you and Jessica...

19:36.759 --> 19:38.761
It's Hope, actually.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.680
I wasn't sure
if it was a coincidence,

19:41.680 --> 19:43.015
so we searched
your van.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.683
We know you're Alaric Saltzman,

19:44.683 --> 19:47.520
headmaster of the Salvatore
School. We know a lot about it.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.480
You have a terrific reputation.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.273
Leave the school out of this.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.859
Look, I applaud
your school's mission.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.695
If you do your job right,
makes mine easier.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.197
So why are we still here?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.366
Well, I have an entire town
that needs to forget

20:00.366 --> 20:02.910
what they've seen today. You
know, usually it's convincing

20:02.910 --> 20:05.204
a farmer in Nebraska
he didn't see a chimera,

20:05.204 --> 20:07.331
you know, or a few ice
fishermen in Minnesota that

20:07.331 --> 20:10.251
it wasn't a yeti that
ate their best friend.

20:10.251 --> 20:14.088
This is an entire town.
It's different.

20:14.088 --> 20:17.383
We could use the assistance
of a vampire.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.552
I noticed the daylight ring
on your daughter's boyfriend...

20:19.552 --> 20:22.680
Oh, he's not...
Never mind.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.723
Why not call it
a freak swarm of bugs?

20:24.723 --> 20:26.308
Why erase it
from memory?

20:26.308 --> 20:29.728
Because someone may recognize
them for what they are.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.897
Harbingers.
Of what?

20:31.897 --> 20:35.276
Seriously? This is obviously
the work of a mummy.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.029
I told you.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.240
One of our drivers survived
an attack by the river.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.242
He's been tracking
the mummy ever since.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.994
He's still on the
outskirts of town,

20:44.994 --> 20:46.662
but he's heading our direction.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.459
We're a cleanup organization.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.712
Okay, we're not equipped
to go to battle with a mummy.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.220
So... will you help?

21:03.220 --> 21:06.849
Cut him off at the pass and
keep all these people safe?

21:06.849 --> 21:09.977
Oh, these are kids...

21:09.977 --> 21:11.896
CLARKE:
Kids with magic,

21:11.896 --> 21:14.315
in a town full
of innocents without it.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.233
We'd be happy to help.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.820
I'm gonna need my weapons.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.573
Of course. Gather what you need.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.408
Round up your friends.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.410
My team can help you
with anything else.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.247
(clears throat)

21:30.247 --> 21:33.292
Okay, I know you don't remember
our trip to Kansas clearly,

21:33.292 --> 21:35.711
but that field that
we woke up in in Georgia,

21:35.711 --> 21:37.505
that's where the portal
to Malivore is.

21:37.505 --> 21:41.967
It's hidden in plain sight
by a company called TRIAD.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.304
Look familiar?

21:50.935 --> 21:53.521
Clarke said the mummy
got the urn here.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.147
Now, if it's like
every other monster,

21:55.147 --> 21:57.733
its objective is to take
the artifact to Malivore.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.777
Route 21 cuts through
the center of town

21:59.777 --> 22:01.445
and winds all the way
to the interstate.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.739
As the crow flies, this is
the straightest route.

22:03.739 --> 22:07.451
So it's gonna be coming
this way, no questions.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.412
(scoffs) Maybe we should just
let him have the urn.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.039
Make this someone
else's problem.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.457
And be responsible
for two-thirds

22:13.457 --> 22:14.959
of the monster apocalypse?

22:14.959 --> 22:18.295
(chuckles) Damn accountability.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.756
Ugh, damn conscience.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.639
Speaking of conscience,

22:28.639 --> 22:31.642
I need to go see
if I can find Dorian.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.478
Yeah, of course.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.689
I'd go with you, but, uh...

22:36.689 --> 22:39.400
No, your girls need you.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.111
Though after giving them a crash
course in offensive magic,

22:42.111 --> 22:44.238
and a mummy running loose,

22:44.238 --> 22:46.198
you may need them more.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.785
Some spring break, huh?

22:49.785 --> 22:51.662
(laughs)

23:00.045 --> 23:02.548
Be safe, Ric.

23:08.804 --> 23:09.805
All right.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.474
So let me run this back--

23:12.474 --> 23:14.810
homie talks like he's
protecting innocents,

23:14.810 --> 23:18.564
but his office actually sits
on top of the portal to hell?

23:18.564 --> 23:21.191
Not hell, specifically.
Hell adjacent.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.693
It's a tar pit

23:22.693 --> 23:25.195
of doom where monsters rot
for all eternity.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.530
Uh-huh.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.241
And if the urn gets to Malivore,
wh-what happens?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.035
The Adjacent Apocalypse?

23:31.035 --> 23:34.747
Two of the three locks that keep
Malivore sealed will be open,

23:34.747 --> 23:37.750
which will lead to the end
of all supernatural beings.

23:39.376 --> 23:42.171
Okay. So we can't let
the mummy get the urn,

23:42.171 --> 23:45.215
we can't let Agent Clarke's
phony hazmat dudes get the urn,

23:45.215 --> 23:47.593
and if we get the urn, then
we're just bringing monsters

23:47.593 --> 23:49.011
back to the school with us?

23:49.011 --> 23:51.639
Yeah. It is kind of a lose-lose.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.433
(laughs) Well, y'all
crazier than my family,

23:54.433 --> 23:55.768
minus the barbecue.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.479
So who do I get to fight?

23:58.479 --> 24:02.232
Actually, I need you
to compel all the locals

24:02.232 --> 24:03.817
to forget what
they've seen.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.320
You mean while everyone else
is fighting an actual mummy,

24:06.320 --> 24:07.946
I'm stuck with a bunch
of simpletons

24:07.946 --> 24:09.448
making them forget about bugs?

24:09.448 --> 24:12.326
I don't know who
this TRIAD group is

24:12.326 --> 24:14.244
or what they intend
to do with the urn,

24:14.244 --> 24:16.664
but we can't run the risk
of letting them get

24:16.664 --> 24:18.374
their hands on it, so first,

24:18.374 --> 24:20.793
we need them to think
that we're on their side.

24:20.793 --> 24:24.380
So vamp powers are cool as long
as it's for something boring.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.424
Look, there's one other thing
I need you to do,

24:27.424 --> 24:29.635
and if we can
pull this off,

24:29.635 --> 24:33.722
I guarantee you the last thing
it's gonna be is boring.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.992
Some people find it helps
to clear their conscience

24:53.992 --> 24:55.786
before heading
into battle.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.580
Not stopping you.
Now is not the time.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.874
It's always time
for truth.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.292
Last chance, Hope.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.461
If you didn't start that fire
to keep us from going,

25:04.461 --> 25:06.338
then why were you
so mean to me after?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.716
I'll tell you why,
because you were guilty.

25:08.716 --> 25:11.009
Girls! Quiet back there, please.
Seriously.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.012
I wasn't mean to you.
You were mean to me.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.765
Because you were telling people
about my episode.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.435
Your what?
My episode.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.520
The one I had when
our trip got cancelled.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.023
You told everyone
that I was witch bipolar.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.608
I would never do that.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.235
Guys, seriously, what is
the point of even talking...

25:28.235 --> 25:29.403
Just drop the act.

25:29.403 --> 25:31.697
I had my first...
occurrence,

25:31.697 --> 25:34.533
my mom took me away to
get help, and you decided

25:34.533 --> 25:36.201
to use it against me.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.786
Guys...
HOPE: I didn't even know.

25:37.786 --> 25:40.706
I swear, I would
never do that.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.082
Guys.
What?
What?

25:42.082 --> 25:45.461
There's a mummy on Main Street.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.755
(mummy growls)

25:58.140 --> 26:00.893
You got this, okay?
You're a fighter.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.227
And Monday morning,
I want you to go

26:02.227 --> 26:03.687
in that office
and demand a raise.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.189
Do not take no
for an answer.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.441
A-And make sure they don't
try to stiff you for bonuses

26:07.441 --> 26:09.818
to make up for it, okay?
'Cause, you know, they do that.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.737
Lock that paper down, dawg.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.697
Oh, oh,

26:13.697 --> 26:16.200
and you didn't see
any hornets today.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.995
Hi, ma'am,
excuse me.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.039
You didn't see
any hornets today.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.416
(sniffs) And... (stammers)

26:24.416 --> 26:27.336
the perfume is not covering up
the smoke, girl, okay?

26:27.336 --> 26:29.046
Instead of trying
to hide the problem,

26:29.046 --> 26:31.006
go home, throw out
that last pack,

26:31.006 --> 26:34.009
and quit for real, all right?
Today. I believe in you.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.929
I don't care if that bus
drops you off 100 miles

26:36.929 --> 26:38.263
from your house.
Good luck.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.848
That is not
our problem, sir.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.976
You have two feet
for a reason. Use them.

26:42.976 --> 26:46.021
You know what a fall guy is?
You mean like a scapegoat?

26:46.021 --> 26:49.399
You know what, let's not even
get caught up in the wording,

26:49.399 --> 26:51.193
'cause whatever you want
to call it, you are

26:51.193 --> 26:55.364
a prime candidate.
Follow my instructions exactly.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.243
So, what, do we,
like, rush it?

26:59.243 --> 27:00.744
It's seven feet tall.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.663
We hold our ground until
it's close enough to attack.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.498
Okay, Dad,
get behind us.
I can't do that.

27:04.498 --> 27:06.667
Dad.
I have to protect you,
all of you.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.126
HOPE: No offense,
Dr. Saltzman, but you

27:08.126 --> 27:09.628
and your crossbow
are kind of manspread

27:09.628 --> 27:12.089
in front of three
powerful witches.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.632
Okay, good point.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.509
Okay, what can a mummy
do to hurt us?

27:15.509 --> 27:17.636
I think we're about to find out.

27:28.564 --> 27:29.857
JOSIE:
Hope.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.360
Bulla.

27:39.700 --> 27:40.659
Nice teamwork.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.748
Should we rush it now?

27:46.748 --> 27:48.166
Not yet.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.589
(growls)

27:53.589 --> 27:54.882
Now?
No.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.302
I really, really think
that we should rush it.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.928
Wait! On three.

28:02.723 --> 28:03.932
One...

28:06.476 --> 28:08.312
Two...

28:10.731 --> 28:12.482
(coughing)
What's happening?

28:12.482 --> 28:14.610
What's happening?

28:14.610 --> 28:18.071
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
(coughing)

28:24.912 --> 28:26.830
Resistus maledi.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.999
Ignalusa.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.900
Worst spring break ever.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.864
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Please form an orderly line

29:00.864 --> 29:02.741
and proceed to the buses.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.410
We will be departing
in five minutes.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.623
I appreciate the cooperation,
Dr. Saltzman.

29:09.623 --> 29:13.710
Hope we never have
to see each other again.

29:13.710 --> 29:17.005
And I hope I never get assigned
to look into your school.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.509
That'd be a real shame.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.437
WOMAN:
Please form an orderly line

29:32.437 --> 29:34.106
and proceed to the buses.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.942
We will be departing
in five minutes.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.464
So the mummy
ain't actually dead?
Well, if I'm right,

29:59.464 --> 30:02.342
the mummy's curse is bound
by the scarab in its chest.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.136
Once the girls
siphon the scarab,

30:04.136 --> 30:06.930
the curse will be lifted
and the mummy will be dead.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.682
Okay, and what if you're wrong?

30:08.682 --> 30:10.434
He's never wrong.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.644
So what now?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.146
ALARIC:
Until we get the urn,

30:14.146 --> 30:16.732
we wait.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.990
How long do we
have to wait?

30:24.990 --> 30:27.242
If I have to bug-hurl again,

30:27.242 --> 30:30.662
I swear to God, I will
never talk to you again.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.166
Okay, that one wasn't even
remotely my fault.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.127
Yeah, well, the beetle slime
in my tonsils says otherwise.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.472
Why can't we just
give the mummy the urn?

30:48.472 --> 30:51.183
Is opening the portal
to Malivore really that bad?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.643
Do any of the monsters that
have been trapped in there

30:53.643 --> 30:55.729
seem happy and balanced to you?

30:55.729 --> 30:57.022
I'm with Josie.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.357
Why don't we skip
bug vomit round two

30:59.357 --> 31:01.777
and just go and get
some pancakes or something?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.792
ALARIC:
Think of it like this.

31:16.792 --> 31:19.336
We'll be setting the mummy
free from his prison.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.463
Hmm. Poor mummy.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.882
(people clamoring)

31:25.175 --> 31:27.552
All right, look, we can keep
having empathy hour

31:27.552 --> 31:29.554
or we can do
what we came here to do.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.848
Here we go.
(glass shatters)

31:33.600 --> 31:35.602
(roars)

31:38.063 --> 31:40.398
What the hell
is happening?

31:40.398 --> 31:41.650
I don't know;
he should be dead.

31:41.650 --> 31:42.984
(roars)

31:42.984 --> 31:44.986
Well, clearly he isn't.
Yeah, I can see that.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.157
HOPE:
He's looking for the urn.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.993
What do we do?
I don't know,
give him the urn.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.621
(mummy roars)
Hey, can someone
give this thing the urn?

31:54.621 --> 31:55.872
TECH (over radio):
Can't. The urn's gone.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.415
Wh-- Who's
been in there?

31:57.415 --> 31:58.750
Only our guys.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.669
(bellowing)

32:00.669 --> 32:02.129
Do something.

32:03.505 --> 32:05.674
Kaleb?
Yep.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.677
Nice bling. Don't
mind if I do.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.345
(snarls)

32:10.345 --> 32:12.055
Lizzie.
Got it.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.266
(snarls, roars)

32:14.266 --> 32:16.017
Oh, crap. Hurry.

32:19.521 --> 32:21.731
Like, hurry hurry.

32:25.360 --> 32:29.364
(loud buzzing)

32:29.364 --> 32:30.323
(chants)

32:32.701 --> 32:34.828
(buzzing quiets)

32:36.705 --> 32:38.498
(exhales)

32:38.498 --> 32:41.126
(exhales sharply)

32:43.295 --> 32:45.297
(mummy growls)

32:50.719 --> 32:52.846
(crackling)

32:56.474 --> 32:58.268
ALARIC:
The curse is lifted.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.936
He's gone.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.024
Well, Agent Clarke,
we do any more work

33:04.024 --> 33:06.818
for you guys, you're gonna
have to put us on the payroll.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.986
Guess we'll be, uh,

33:07.986 --> 33:09.446
on our way out of here.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.449
Whew.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.701
ALARIC:
Good night.
(van hood closes)

33:20.582 --> 33:22.751
(insects trilling)

33:27.797 --> 33:28.840
(engine turns off)

33:28.840 --> 33:30.300
(sighs) Okay.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.719
So where is she?

33:32.719 --> 33:34.596
You doubting my skills?

33:35.847 --> 33:37.682
There.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.855
Thank you.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.274
Oh, and you may want to lay low
for a little bit, sweetie.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.404
You're welcome.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.156
(chuckles softly)

33:53.156 --> 33:54.699
All right,
let's go home.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.576
All right.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.038
Wait a second.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.299
HOPE:
They have Dorian and Emma.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.468
Oh...

34:15.095 --> 34:17.055
(exhales sharply)

34:20.475 --> 34:22.602
(sighs heavily)

34:27.899 --> 34:29.776
(sighs):
All right.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.027
Sit tight.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.750
I'm impressed.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.794
I almost hate
to take it off you.

34:49.671 --> 34:54.259
My team found your...
"wife" looking for Dorian.

34:54.259 --> 34:57.012
We thought the two of
them would provide some

34:57.012 --> 34:59.889
nice leverage in case
things went wrong.

35:00.974 --> 35:04.227
I think you know what to do
to get them back.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.646
(gun cocks)

35:18.908 --> 35:20.744
Let them go.

What I don't get

36:16.049 --> 36:18.593
is why anyone would
accuse me of that.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.512
Who did you hear it from?

36:20.512 --> 36:22.222

Kaleb.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.752
I wanted to thank you
for today.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.754
And God knows
what's coming next, but...

36:54.754 --> 36:57.132
you really showed me
what you're made of.

36:57.132 --> 36:59.092
You had our back.

36:59.092 --> 37:00.635
Then can I be real with you?

37:00.635 --> 37:01.928
Of course.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.805
You know, whether it's Clarke

37:03.805 --> 37:05.432
or a monster,

37:05.432 --> 37:07.725
we all need access
to our full powers.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.477
I mean, all
I did today

37:09.477 --> 37:12.730
was compel a few people
and I'm out of steam.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.607

37:19.779 --> 37:22.782

37:22.782 --> 37:24.784
I respect you.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.536
I respect what
you're trying to do here.

37:26.536 --> 37:29.622
But times
are different now, Dr. S.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.332
The rules should be, too.

37:31.332 --> 37:34.294
♪ Kinda used to being
someone you loved ♪

37:34.294 --> 37:36.463
Why would you
drive a wedge

37:36.463 --> 37:38.047
between me and Hope?

37:38.047 --> 37:39.340
Why lie?

37:39.340 --> 37:41.843
HOPE: I was gonna
ask the same thing.

37:47.849 --> 37:50.685
(exhales)
I didn't just lie.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.063
I started the fire.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.317
Lizzie had made some remark...

37:57.317 --> 37:59.986
about me being
obsessed with you.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.155
I just blurted out, "How
could I be obsessed with

38:02.155 --> 38:04.449
somebody who would say
such mean things about my twin?"

38:04.449 --> 38:05.700
But I didn't.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.995
I know. I just made it up.
Why?

38:08.995 --> 38:11.372
Because I didn't want Lizzie
to know the truth.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.084
I had a crush on you.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.797
And I had slipped a note into
your room that morning and...

38:19.797 --> 38:21.508
I don't know,
I just really

38:21.508 --> 38:23.718
immediately regretted it
but I couldn't get in by then.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.262
So I did a fire spell
under your door.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.143
I was really only aiming
for the note.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.106
Why would it matter
that I knew?
Because

38:37.106 --> 38:39.359
my whole life, any time

38:39.359 --> 38:41.361
I've ever liked anyone,

38:41.361 --> 38:43.613
you go for them.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.365
And you always win.

38:45.365 --> 38:48.368
(chuckles softly)
You had a crush on me?

38:50.286 --> 38:52.038
Of course I did.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.873
Who wouldn't?

39:02.215 --> 39:04.384
I can't believe we
almost lost you.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.386
Hey.
It's fine now.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.721
I'm okay.
You're okay.

39:08.721 --> 39:09.889
I'm sorry.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.307
For holding back.

39:11.307 --> 39:14.018
For not knowing
how I felt about you, but...

39:14.018 --> 39:16.145
I know now.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.901
I've always known
how I felt about you.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.571
(gasps softly)

39:24.571 --> 39:26.406
No.

39:28.408 --> 39:29.534
There's more.

39:29.534 --> 39:33.371
I didn't know because
I was confused.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.582
(sighs)

39:35.582 --> 39:37.584
I kissed Alaric.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.294
And it was days ago when

39:39.294 --> 39:41.296
that magical slug was in me,
but that's no excuse.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.173
Are you saying you would have
kissed him without it?

39:44.173 --> 39:46.426
I'm saying
I don't want to anymore.

39:47.552 --> 39:48.970
Are you sure?

39:48.970 --> 39:50.597
I'm positive.

40:01.190 --> 40:05.028
Did Ric have a slug in his ear
when he kissed you?

40:11.659 --> 40:13.745
Dorian...

40:13.745 --> 40:16.539
I'm so sorry for today.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.499
(Alaric grunts)

40:18.499 --> 40:20.543
I quit.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.388
(insects trilling)

40:35.308 --> 40:37.060
Looks like
a piece of junk to me.

40:37.060 --> 40:39.187
A rose by any other name.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.439
(chuckles) You'd better hustle.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.650
Mrs. G. wants that
in the vault ASAP.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.360
She's the boss.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.532
(gunshot)
(gasps)

41:10.718 --> 41:12.679
(bubbling)

41:29.195 --> 41:31.656
Not long now.
