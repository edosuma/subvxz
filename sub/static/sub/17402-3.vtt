00:06.328 --> 00:09.008
Tonight...
A dog looks over a wall...

00:10.285 --> 00:12.045
..we drive some chairs...

00:13.285 --> 00:16.125
..and The Stig
does a skid in a supercharged Jag.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.883
Hello, everybody!

00:24.885 --> 00:27.563
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

00:27.565 --> 00:29.763
Thank you.

00:29.765 --> 00:31.843
Now...

00:31.845 --> 00:36.643
Now, every year we like to take
three of the latest super-expensive

00:36.645 --> 00:41.283
supercars over to continental Europe
to find out which one is best.

00:41.285 --> 00:45.445
But these days, thanks to
the financial crisis over there,

00:45.574 --> 00:48.414
that's proving to be a bit tricky.

01:02.894 --> 01:05.892
Here in Britain, the economy
is not that great

01:05.894 --> 01:09.252
but from what we understand,
over the border in Spain,

01:09.254 --> 01:11.074
things are absolutely dreadful.

01:11.109 --> 01:14.267
Yes, so it really wouldn't be
appropriate for us to do what

01:14.269 --> 01:18.867
we usually do and turn up in three
million-pound V12 monsters.

01:18.869 --> 01:21.707
No, because that would just look
like we were showing off. Exactly.

01:21.709 --> 01:25.307
Yes, but because it's Spain, and
therefore likely to be very sunny,

01:25.309 --> 01:27.707
we did want to be able to
take the roof off, so what

01:27.709 --> 01:31.987
we've done is we've organised three
budget convertibles for a nice drive

01:31.989 --> 01:34.349
from here in Britain to Madrid.

01:47.869 --> 01:51.747
I've gone for the second cheapest
car in the Ferrari range,

01:51.749 --> 01:54.307
which is not necessarily a bad thing.

01:54.309 --> 01:56.107
It's like choosing
wine in a restaurant.

01:56.109 --> 01:59.229
As we all know, the second cheapest
is always your best bet.

02:02.069 --> 02:06.547
It's the 458 and this is the new
Spider version, available

02:06.549 --> 02:10.549
now for a very reasonable £198,000.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.507
I've gone for the new McLaren
convertible,

02:18.509 --> 02:23.947
the 12C Spider, which amazingly
is even cheaper.

02:23.949 --> 02:27.989
This is just £195,000.

02:29.349 --> 02:33.627
For that sort of money,
I was expecting a sort of Scout hut

02:33.629 --> 02:37.027
with windscreen wipers,
but I've got sat nav,

02:37.029 --> 02:40.267
I've got air conditioning,
central locking, electric windows,

02:40.269 --> 02:43.829
power steering,
it's really not bad at all.

02:47.909 --> 02:52.069
But when it comes to value,
Iron Man had trumped both of us.

02:53.629 --> 02:54.867
Yes, yes, hello, viewers,

02:54.869 --> 02:57.467
and as you would expect,
I have done it properly.

02:57.469 --> 03:02.147
I've chosen the Audi R8
convertible, the V10 version,

03:02.149 --> 03:06.227
a mere sniff as £121,000.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.667
Although, to be honest,
from where I'm sitting,

03:08.669 --> 03:11.907
I really can't work out why it's
so much cheaper than the others.

03:11.909 --> 03:18.907
I mean, it has the biggest engine,
5.2 litre V10 from a Lamborghini...

03:18.909 --> 03:22.747
It has four-wheel drive, it has
the best standard equipment.

03:22.749 --> 03:26.029
It is the perfect car
for a cash-strapped economy.

03:29.469 --> 03:31.387
Our first port of call, however,

03:31.389 --> 03:34.269
didn't look very cash-strapped
at all.

03:37.749 --> 03:41.827
That's because it was Puerto Banus,
still thriving because

03:41.829 --> 03:45.949
every summer, people from Essex come
here to make themselves more orange.

03:47.669 --> 03:51.107
Their taste may be quiet
and restrained but it's keeping

03:51.109 --> 03:56.947
the local economy going and it also
gave James an idea for a test.

03:56.949 --> 04:00.507
Well, the whole point of a budget
supercar is that it should be

04:00.509 --> 04:02.827
understated, right?

04:02.829 --> 04:04.307
So here's what we do.

04:04.309 --> 04:08.427
You have to drive from here to
the other end of the harbour,

04:08.429 --> 04:14.187
one at a time, and the winner is the
one whose car is least photographed.

04:14.189 --> 04:19.507
James, I'm in a yellow metal
flake convertible McLaren. I know.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.989
Well, it's going to get photographed
all the time. Well, you chose it!

04:24.109 --> 04:27.547
After dusk, and with a camera fitted
to record flashes,

04:27.549 --> 04:31.829
James set off, confident his
grey Audi would be like a ghost.

04:33.669 --> 04:34.669
Hammond...

04:39.949 --> 04:41.827
"People of Puerto Banus..."

04:41.829 --> 04:44.627
"James May driving through
your town."

04:44.629 --> 04:46.747
"Now! Get your pictures."

04:46.749 --> 04:48.909
Tweet sent. Yes!

04:51.109 --> 04:54.229
Annoyingly, though, our plan didn't
work very well.

04:55.789 --> 04:59.547
See, it doesn't draw attention,
the car doesn't draw attention.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.109
No flashes whatsoever.

05:04.269 --> 05:08.909
There you go, a successful, largely
photograph-free run.

05:10.829 --> 05:15.827
'The Ferrari attracted quite a lot
more attention.'

05:15.829 --> 05:17.547
OK, that's...

05:17.549 --> 05:20.347
Yeah, I got hit there,
that was a lucky shot.

05:20.349 --> 05:22.507
'..even after I'd finished.'

05:22.509 --> 05:25.949
That does not count! Can I have
a picture of your car, mate?

05:27.749 --> 05:31.509
Then Jeremy set off in his metal
flake yellow McLaren.

05:36.429 --> 05:40.227
Oh, this is astonishing.

05:40.229 --> 05:44.067
A McLaren Formula One car would get
less attention than this.

05:44.069 --> 05:46.587
'Once I'd reached
the finish line...'

05:46.589 --> 05:49.307
No photographs! No photographs here!

05:49.309 --> 05:51.709
'..the producers handed
over the score.'

05:54.389 --> 05:55.907
I'm really tired. Read them out.

05:55.909 --> 05:58.467
Shall I read them out?
Just read them out.

05:58.469 --> 06:00.667
I'm just...
I just want to go to bed.

06:00.669 --> 06:02.507
OK, no need to do
it in reverse order, then.

06:02.509 --> 06:04.227
Do it in the order we went.

06:04.229 --> 06:06.787
OK. Audi, 22.

06:06.789 --> 06:08.427
22 people took your picture.

06:08.429 --> 06:11.067
Is that good or bad? Ferrari...

06:11.069 --> 06:13.749
47 people took your picture.

06:16.029 --> 06:17.349
How many flashes?

06:19.389 --> 06:22.147
Yes, you lost. Bloody hell.
You did lose.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.709
438!

06:25.589 --> 06:28.627
So, as a budget supercar,

06:28.629 --> 06:31.987
McLaren has not done well in terms
of understatement, has it?

06:31.989 --> 06:33.589
No. It's a bit conspicuous.

06:38.829 --> 06:41.347
The next day,
we left the affluent coast

06:41.349 --> 06:44.989
and headed north into what people
call the real Spain.

06:51.789 --> 06:54.267
So, Spain, six million unemployed

06:54.269 --> 06:57.427
and they have a smaller population
than we do.

06:57.429 --> 07:00.587
two million households have no
income at all.

07:00.589 --> 07:03.469
57% youth unemployment.

07:05.189 --> 07:08.027
'Right now, though, James was
dealing

07:08.029 --> 07:10.547
'with rather more serious issues.'

07:10.549 --> 07:12.227
The cabin is too blustery.

07:12.229 --> 07:15.907
I've got both the windows up
and I have the windshield thing

07:15.909 --> 07:18.787
at the back up, but my hair
still whips me in the eyeballs.

07:18.789 --> 07:21.707
I know some of you are going, "Why
don't you get your hair cut, then?"

07:21.709 --> 07:23.469
Lots of people have lots of hair.

07:30.189 --> 07:34.187
James has now cured the appalling
buffeting in the Audi

07:34.189 --> 07:36.469
with the simple addition
of a bandanna...

07:38.349 --> 07:40.309
..which makes him look very manly.

07:43.949 --> 07:48.627
'We decided to stop in the next
town for some coffee, and here

07:48.629 --> 07:53.989
'we saw just how badly hit Spain
has been by the financial crisis.'

08:01.829 --> 08:04.149
These are all brand-new flats.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.467
There's nobody here.

08:07.469 --> 08:09.589
I mean, nobody at all.

08:11.749 --> 08:16.427
It's got all of the infrastructure.
Street lights,

08:16.429 --> 08:19.589
pedestrian crossings,
but no people at all.

08:22.549 --> 08:24.069
Look at it.

08:26.109 --> 08:28.827
It's a scene from a horror film.

08:28.829 --> 08:30.747
I mean,
you hear about these ghost towns

08:30.749 --> 08:32.909
but you don't really think
they exist.

08:34.669 --> 08:36.707
'Still, on the up-side,

08:36.708 --> 08:40.707
'the echoey empty streets did
provide the perfect setting

08:40.708 --> 08:42.787
'for a noise test.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.987
'I parked at the far end of town

08:45.989 --> 08:49.827
'while Jeremy fired up his
decibel-o-meter.'

08:49.829 --> 08:52.587
When I say Jeremy has
a decibel-o-meter,

08:52.589 --> 08:54.429
it's the decibel-o-meter app.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.147
It's probably rubbish.

08:58.149 --> 08:59.667
Slightly worried about this,

08:59.669 --> 09:02.587
because he's got two more cylinders
than we have. Yes.

09:02.589 --> 09:04.427
He's got ten. So that's two more...

09:04.429 --> 09:06.587
And one more cylinder firing per...
Bank.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.427
Yes. So that's two more...

09:08.429 --> 09:11.067
He's got two banks of five,
we've got two banks of four.

09:11.069 --> 09:14.547
Yes, so he's got two more
explosions per...

09:14.549 --> 09:17.787
Per... Every time there's
firing, there'll be one more.

09:17.789 --> 09:20.667
Yes, but that's on each bank. Yes.

09:20.669 --> 09:23.387
Welcome to Top Gear,
the world's leading motoring show.

09:23.389 --> 09:24.709
Here we go.

09:35.229 --> 09:37.869
105. 105. Yes.

09:39.269 --> 09:42.587
'Next it was the McLaren's turn.'

09:42.589 --> 09:45.547
I'm ready. Oh, good.

09:45.549 --> 09:47.227
Begin.

09:47.229 --> 09:49.269
You see, start quietly.

09:51.229 --> 09:56.547
Hold it in second so
when we get near the decibel-o-meter

09:56.549 --> 09:58.869
I'm at the top of the rev range.
Here we go.

10:00.789 --> 10:04.469
Yes! Now, that was mighty.

10:07.909 --> 10:10.907
What's my score? 105.

10:10.909 --> 10:13.187
What? 105 again.

10:13.189 --> 10:14.907
What, the same as his? Yes.

10:14.909 --> 10:17.349
That's very much the same, yes.
Rubbish!

10:18.749 --> 10:22.669
'With Jeremy still complaining,
I lined up the Ferrari.'

10:24.949 --> 10:27.387
I bet he just floors it
from the start.

10:27.389 --> 10:29.467
Yes, he has. Daft as a brush.

10:29.469 --> 10:31.349
He's got to go as fast as possible.

10:34.949 --> 10:36.389
Stupidest man in the world.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.509
107. Hmm.

10:46.709 --> 10:50.387
Hammond was, as ever,
gracious in victory.

10:50.389 --> 10:52.347
Ha-ha! Come on, it's still more,

10:52.349 --> 10:54.387
and those last few decibels
are harder to get.

10:54.389 --> 10:57.027
It's like the last few miles an hour
because of aerodynamics.

10:57.029 --> 10:59.907
So, wait, that must mean you lose.
It does. No, you got 105...

10:59.909 --> 11:03.227
No, it's budget supercars.

11:03.229 --> 11:06.107
Discretion. The quietist. Yeah.

11:06.109 --> 11:08.387
Really? We've just decided.

11:08.389 --> 11:11.787
So the rules have just changed
at the exact moment at which you lost

11:11.789 --> 11:13.187
and I won.

11:13.189 --> 11:14.989
We never discussed rules.

11:17.949 --> 11:22.307
'Back on the move, we headed for the
Sierra Nevada mountains on what is

11:22.309 --> 11:24.867
'not only the highest road in Europe

11:24.869 --> 11:27.269
'but also one of the most
spectacular.

11:33.149 --> 11:36.469
'This is perfect supercar country.'

11:42.589 --> 11:47.267
When the McLaren MP4 first came out
18 months ago, it was better than

11:47.269 --> 11:53.947
a Ferrari 458 in every measurable
way, but it lacked panache,

11:53.949 --> 11:56.067
it lacked zing, it lacked
excitement,

11:56.069 --> 11:58.789
it felt clinical and antiseptic.

12:00.189 --> 12:03.507
'Since then, though,
they've made lots of little changes,

12:03.509 --> 12:07.229
'so now there's more noise
and even more power.'

12:10.469 --> 12:14.229
But the big thing is - all that sky!

12:22.109 --> 12:27.309
This is what the McLaren was always
meant to be - open top.

12:29.469 --> 12:32.867
'By taking off the roof, they've
turned the McLaren from a car

12:32.869 --> 12:37.587
'you admire into a car you want.'

12:37.589 --> 12:39.309
Oh, you really, really want this.

12:57.909 --> 12:59.427
There's no denying it,

12:59.429 --> 13:02.787
the Ferrari is down on power
compared to the McLaren.

13:02.789 --> 13:06.827
Overall, it makes about 50 brake
horsepower but it is lighter,

13:06.829 --> 13:08.667
it's the lightest here.

13:08.669 --> 13:11.189
Nevertheless, I am not complaining.

13:12.589 --> 13:15.347
The point and squirt-ability of this
thing...

13:15.349 --> 13:17.949
OK, a bit of wrestling to get it
around the corner and then...

13:19.829 --> 13:22.789
Ya! What a soundtrack!

13:24.909 --> 13:27.749
'Meanwhile,
back in the cheap seats...'

13:36.029 --> 13:40.707
Right, serious stuff. This Audi is,
give or take a few quid,

13:40.709 --> 13:44.707
£70,000 cheaper than the other two.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.547
So, why?

13:46.549 --> 13:49.147
Well, it's got a slightly
lower top speed.

13:49.149 --> 13:51.307
It's slightly
slower at 60 miles an hour.

13:51.309 --> 13:52.507
It weighs quite a bit more,

13:52.509 --> 13:56.549
and with the best will in the world,
it does have a second-hand engine.

13:58.989 --> 14:02.787
But it does have four-wheel-drive.

14:02.789 --> 14:05.229
'And then there's the new gearbox.'

14:06.949 --> 14:10.147
It used to be the single clutch
flappy paddle type.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.147
It's now twin clutch, seven
speed,

14:12.149 --> 14:16.189
and it is absolutely
fantastic. Listen to this.

14:17.789 --> 14:19.989
A gear, a gear.

14:21.509 --> 14:23.869
Seriously, it is superb.

14:25.669 --> 14:29.867
'Intoxicated by our cut-price
supercars, we climbed higher

14:29.869 --> 14:31.349
'and higher.'

14:33.629 --> 14:36.029
Come on, Hammond,
try and live with this.

14:40.149 --> 14:43.347
God, it announces its arrival!

14:43.349 --> 14:46.987
And the road got better and better.

14:46.989 --> 14:48.509
Snow!

14:49.589 --> 14:50.749
Look at that!

14:53.269 --> 14:56.907
This road is just staggering.

14:56.909 --> 14:59.747
How much did it cost?

14:59.749 --> 15:01.229
Oh.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.069
Oh.

15:07.229 --> 15:08.749
What, that's it?

15:12.109 --> 15:15.627
And stop.
What? Hang on a second!

15:15.629 --> 15:18.707
You know the road was really
quiet? Yes.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.747
Would you like to know why? Yes.

15:20.749 --> 15:23.867
It doesn't go anywhere.
That's the end.

15:23.869 --> 15:26.147
I can't wait to see the road that
leads to a city.

15:26.149 --> 15:30.069
It's going to be absolutely awesome.
It must be if it goes somewhere!

15:37.029 --> 15:40.987
How much money did that cost?
Yes, a lot.

15:40.989 --> 15:46.867
Anyway, what we learned on the road
to absolutely nowhere at all

15:46.869 --> 15:50.427
is just how fast that McLaren is.
Yes.

15:50.429 --> 15:53.147
I mean, it was fast
when it came out, but now...

15:53.149 --> 15:56.227
It's astonishing and when you're in
a Ferrari you do not expect to

15:56.229 --> 15:58.547
be left behind by anything.

15:58.549 --> 16:01.467
On the straights,
it just walks away.

16:01.469 --> 16:04.667
It was like you were in a Nissan
Micra and I was in a supercar.

16:04.669 --> 16:06.747
That's the straights,
the corners were worse

16:06.749 --> 16:09.667
because following the McLaren,
you watch it go round at a speed,

16:09.669 --> 16:12.627
and you think "I'll go around at
the same speed" and you can't.

16:12.629 --> 16:14.027
It's unbelievable.

16:14.029 --> 16:17.387
Can I just say, the McLaren is epic,
I agree with you,

16:17.389 --> 16:23.347
but in the two tests we conducted
so far, the victor is the Audi.

16:23.349 --> 16:26.307
Yes, it tied with
the McLaren for one of them.

16:26.309 --> 16:31.787
We also did an economy run. And the
Audi won that, as well. Yes, it did.

16:31.789 --> 16:35.267
So, anyway, later on, there will be
more cut-price supercar larks

16:35.269 --> 16:39.907
from Spain. In the meantime,
here is the news.

16:39.909 --> 16:43.707
No, I've got an announcement to
make first. Really?

16:43.709 --> 16:49.227
Yes, last week, in a bid to show
that Britain is not too crowded to

16:49.229 --> 16:55.867
have fun in a nice car, I took
a Ferrari to this road, and I said

16:55.869 --> 16:58.427
that even though this was
just 40 miles from London

16:58.429 --> 17:00.429
in Hertfordshire...

17:02.269 --> 17:03.707
..there was no traffic at all

17:03.709 --> 17:07.146
and you could still enjoy it
in the Ferrari that I was using.

17:07.148 --> 17:12.067
Well, we have been inundated with
complaints, and I do mean inundated.

17:12.069 --> 17:16.146
There have been a lot. A lot.
People were absolutely furious.

17:16.148 --> 17:20.906
"How dare the BBC say this is
Hertfordshire?! It plainly isn't."

17:20.909 --> 17:23.867
Well, you're right,
I admit it, and I apologise.

17:23.868 --> 17:27.269
That is not Hertfordshire.
It's Buckinghamshire, actually.

17:28.829 --> 17:31.187
Nevertheless, well spotted,
all of you, for seeing that.

17:31.189 --> 17:32.667
You were on the ball, there.

17:32.669 --> 17:36.147
Hey, now, we've got some important
consumer news for everybody.

17:36.149 --> 17:39.147
When you go to a car showroom now,
the salesman will try to sell you

17:39.149 --> 17:42.027
lots of electronic bits
and bobs for your car.

17:42.029 --> 17:45.627
Here's our Top Gear top tip -
don't bother with any of them

17:45.629 --> 17:47.627
because they don't work,
any of them.

17:47.629 --> 17:50.467
Bluetooth. Bluetooth never works.
It doesn't.

17:50.469 --> 17:54.147
Hammond uses it and it's like he's
sitting at the bottom of a river.

17:54.149 --> 17:56.587
Well, to be fair, sometimes I am.

17:56.589 --> 18:00.067
Shall I tell you the thing that
doesn't work the most of all?

18:00.069 --> 18:02.547
Voice activation.
That's just a shouting match.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.347
You're driving along, don't have to
take your hands off the wheel.

18:05.349 --> 18:08.027
You go, "Call Richard Hammond."
"Collapsing suspension".

18:08.029 --> 18:10.467
It does!

18:10.469 --> 18:11.747
Oh, it's misunderstood me.

18:11.749 --> 18:14.827
"Call Richard Hammond."

18:14.829 --> 18:16.547
"Deflating tyres."

18:16.549 --> 18:18.787
That's it!

18:18.789 --> 18:20.827
"Reinflate tyres!"

18:20.829 --> 18:23.509
"Reinflate tyres!"
"Calling Richard Hammond."

18:24.989 --> 18:28.867
The problem is that, in the olden
days, when it first came out,

18:28.869 --> 18:31.867
voice activation was just for the
radio or the satellite navigation.

18:31.869 --> 18:34.307
Now it's for every single
feature on the car

18:34.309 --> 18:37.107
and in your life, and it has to
understand every accent

18:37.109 --> 18:38.627
in all of Britain.

18:38.629 --> 18:40.347
"Och aye the noo."

18:40.349 --> 18:41.909
"All right, pet?"

18:43.349 --> 18:46.907
It just can't cope. So, you're
driving along, you go, "Radio Two."

18:46.909 --> 18:49.627
"Accessing bank account."

18:49.629 --> 18:51.147
Oh, no!

18:51.149 --> 18:52.867
"Transferring funds."

18:52.869 --> 18:54.907
God, no, don't!

18:54.909 --> 18:58.107
While we're having a moan,
I don't like electric boot closing.

18:58.109 --> 19:02.187
With you on that. What was
the matter with slamming the boot?

19:02.189 --> 19:04.107
So instead of doing that,
it's just...

19:04.109 --> 19:05.627
The idea is that you press the button

19:05.629 --> 19:10.347
and the boot sets off and you can
get in your car, but it's so slow!

19:10.349 --> 19:13.587
By the time you've got in your car,
your dog had seen its opportunity

19:13.589 --> 19:16.267
and made a break for freedom,
he's in the traffic.

19:16.269 --> 19:20.067
Or worse, it detects your
shopping in the boot

19:20.069 --> 19:22.069
and it thinks,
"That could be a child."

19:23.989 --> 19:27.907
Oh, look, it's a packet of dog
biscuits, it's not a baby.

19:27.909 --> 19:30.507
"Firing airbag in three..."

19:30.509 --> 19:32.107
Don't fire the airbag!

19:32.109 --> 19:33.827
Too much responsibility.

19:33.829 --> 19:37.347
Modern cars are deeply irritating
because of the electronics.

19:37.349 --> 19:38.427
Can I move it on now?

19:38.429 --> 19:41.907
Now, last week
I asked if you would send in

19:41.909 --> 19:45.627
photographs of Jeremy
on his new bicycle.

19:45.629 --> 19:49.187
Because... Well, I didn't expect to
get anything because, frankly,

19:49.189 --> 19:52.747
I didn't believe he'd bought
a bike. I have! Well... I have!

19:52.749 --> 19:54.347
Do you know, I now believe you.

19:54.349 --> 19:56.787
I know you have, because somebody
HAS sent in a picture.

19:56.789 --> 19:59.149
And here he is -
Jeremy on his bicycle.

20:06.709 --> 20:09.467
It's, er... It's working.

20:09.469 --> 20:12.067
You are losing weight.
You're trimming down.

20:12.069 --> 20:15.307
That's not my bike.
I haven't got stabilisers.

20:15.309 --> 20:17.827
Otherwise, it's pretty accurate.

20:17.829 --> 20:19.347
I've got some serious news.

20:19.349 --> 20:22.627
A lot of cars these days have got
a sport button on them, OK?

20:22.629 --> 20:26.267
The idea is you push it
and it makes everything more taut
and more racy, OK?

20:26.269 --> 20:30.067
But I've long harboured
a suspicion that it doesn't
actually make the car go any faster.

20:30.069 --> 20:31.147
So last week we did a test.

20:31.149 --> 20:34.187
They've got a new Golf GTI
down here, which incidentally,

20:34.189 --> 20:38.227
is a brilliant, brilliant car.
Extremely good. It's properly good.

20:38.229 --> 20:40.787
Anyway, we got The Stig,
put him in normal mode,

20:40.789 --> 20:44.787
sent him around the track
and he did a 129.6, OK?

20:44.789 --> 20:48.547
We then put it in sport
which beefed up the suspension

20:48.549 --> 20:51.427
and the front differential
and it made the steering heavier

20:51.429 --> 20:55.547
and it quickened the throttle, OK?
In sport, 129.6.

20:55.549 --> 20:58.027
What, exactly the same?
Exactly the same.

20:58.029 --> 21:01.427
We then put it in comfort mode,
makes everything soft and gooey.

21:01.429 --> 21:04.867
129.5. Fast!

21:04.869 --> 21:05.987
Faster.

21:05.989 --> 21:10.227
That is confirmation
that the sport button just makes
a car more uncomfortable.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.707
Yeah, it shouldn't say "sport",

21:11.709 --> 21:13.427
it should just say, "worse".

21:13.429 --> 21:15.107
Now, there's a new supercar.

21:15.109 --> 21:19.667
It is called the... Icona Vulcano.
Here it is.

21:19.669 --> 21:23.947
Jeremy, did you do
that publicity photograph?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.667
That's what
I call a publicity shot.

21:25.669 --> 21:28.947
I love that very much.
Not sure about the car, though.

21:28.949 --> 21:33.107
They say it has a V12 hybrid,
but they won't tell us

21:33.109 --> 21:36.267
where the V12's from or
how the hybrid system works.

21:36.269 --> 21:39.907
All they will say
is it develops 950 horsepower

21:39.909 --> 21:42.067
and will go 217 miles an hour.

21:42.069 --> 21:44.387
Does it? Mmm, mmm.

21:44.389 --> 21:48.707
The reason I brought this car up
is their chief design director,

21:48.709 --> 21:52.467
his name is Samuel Chuffart.

21:52.469 --> 21:55.107
Give over.

21:55.109 --> 21:56.867
It's not.

21:56.869 --> 22:02.067
His name is not Chuffart.
It's not! Chuffart. Lovely.

22:02.069 --> 22:05.229
There's a man with fond
memories of his school days!

22:06.549 --> 22:10.427
Every register, "Oh, no, it's got to
Christian, I'm next." "Chuffart".

22:10.429 --> 22:13.347
"A-ha-ha-ha." I bet the
novelty never wore off for him.

22:13.349 --> 22:15.867
Apparently,
he worked at Jaguar for a while.

22:15.869 --> 22:18.549
I'm not sure what happened there.
They probably had to let him go.

22:21.709 --> 22:24.267
So now he's ended up in Italy,
because that is an Italian firm.

22:24.269 --> 22:26.067
They're actually making
the car in China.

22:26.069 --> 22:29.067
Can you imagine what
the wiring's going to be like?

22:29.069 --> 22:33.067
Chuffart in Italian probably means
"hat penis" anyway, or something.

22:33.069 --> 22:36.067
We actually asked our researchers
to call up this company and say,

22:36.069 --> 22:38.347
"Can you tell us more about
the car?" And not one of them

22:38.349 --> 22:41.227
could get through the beginning bit
of the call without bursting...

22:41.229 --> 22:43.707
The receptionist on the other end
must be used to the phone

22:43.709 --> 22:46.787
ringing and there's
someone laughing,
"Yeah, I'll put you through."

22:46.789 --> 22:48.147
"Hello, Chuffart."

22:48.149 --> 22:54.789
He probably just answers the phone
with the words, "Yes, that is
my name. Let's clear the air now."

22:56.069 --> 22:58.347
That's how that picture came about.

22:58.349 --> 23:01.189
Someone lit a match just after
Chuff farted!

23:03.829 --> 23:07.827
Moving on. Because this week we are
testing the McLaren 12C Spider,

23:07.829 --> 23:11.987
the Ferrari 458 Spider
and the Audi R8 V10.

23:11.989 --> 23:15.987
Let me guess, is it Spider?
Do you know, it is. It is a Spider.

23:15.989 --> 23:19.427
We have chosen budget supercars
because we are in Spain,

23:19.429 --> 23:21.867
where the economic problems
are terrible.

23:21.869 --> 23:24.067
Yeah,
so far we've been to a ghost town.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.347
It had a hospital,
it had a school, had restaurants,

23:26.349 --> 23:29.427
had thousands of houses and flats,
but no people at all.

23:29.429 --> 23:32.347
We've been on a road that
went nowhere.

23:32.349 --> 23:34.427
It was like filming in
a ghost country, actually.

23:34.429 --> 23:38.549
Anyway, we pick up the story
after a night in a hotel in Granada.

24:01.549 --> 24:03.467
We headed north
the following morning,

24:03.469 --> 24:07.429
worried that we'd hit the rush-hour
traffic. However...

24:10.389 --> 24:14.787
So there's only three cars on this
motorway and we're in all of them.

24:14.789 --> 24:17.987
Look at that.
Our own personal motorway.

24:17.989 --> 24:19.989
I've always wanted a motorway.

24:21.149 --> 24:22.627
Since no-one was around,

24:22.629 --> 24:25.069
we thought we would see
how fast our cars would go.

24:26.949 --> 24:28.829
We just need to find a straight bit.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.429
Now, this is quite straight.

24:34.829 --> 24:39.347
At 200 miles an hour, this slight
corner becomes a hairpin bend.

24:39.349 --> 24:40.469
We need arrow straight.

24:42.509 --> 24:47.149
'When we did eventually find a long
enough straight, it had goats on it.

24:48.429 --> 24:53.269
'So we were about to give up
on our top speed run, but then...'

24:54.349 --> 24:55.349
Ooh, an airport.

24:56.989 --> 25:01.547
Chaps, is that an airport? I just
thought... Yes, aeropuerto, it is.

25:01.549 --> 25:03.907
Well, if the runway's as busy
as the roads,

25:03.909 --> 25:06.989
we might be able to
use the runway for our speed test.

25:13.189 --> 25:16.427
God, there's some parking available!

25:16.429 --> 25:18.509
All of it in fact.

25:21.789 --> 25:24.069
Er... Where is everyone?

25:29.069 --> 25:33.349
'We went inside to
look for someone in charge.'

25:34.509 --> 25:36.189
Hello?

25:38.229 --> 25:39.309
Hello?

25:40.269 --> 25:43.189
'But the whole place
was completely deserted.'

25:46.429 --> 25:50.067
The computers are all on, look!
I can make a baggage check.

25:50.069 --> 25:53.509
I can log on!
I've got one of those things that
goes... I can check you in!

25:57.709 --> 25:58.707
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

25:58.709 --> 26:01.987
The wheel's coming off.
My wheel's come off!

26:01.989 --> 26:04.707
Hello. I'll be Lufthansa.
I am sorry, the gate is closed.

26:04.709 --> 26:08.147
Well, can you just open it? Nein.

26:08.149 --> 26:11.949
I haven't got a passport,
I've just got a selection of weapons
and some concealed drugs.

26:15.069 --> 26:17.829
Eventually, though,
we found what we came for.

26:18.989 --> 26:21.189
That is a runway over there,
I believe. Yes.

26:23.909 --> 26:27.667
'But since there was no-one around
to ask for permission to use it,

26:27.669 --> 26:29.987
'we had to improvise.'

26:29.989 --> 26:33.267
Would it be possible for us
to drive on the runway here?

26:33.269 --> 26:37.347
Is there any flight traffic today?
No, it's very quiet today.

26:37.349 --> 26:39.229
I imagine it'll be fine.

26:44.509 --> 26:47.669
With permission granted,
we headed out to the runway.

26:49.149 --> 26:52.029
It's all right, I've got it.
I've got it. It's OK.

26:53.229 --> 26:55.389
I can't do manual labour,
you know that.

26:59.709 --> 27:00.709
Look at that!

27:02.669 --> 27:03.669
It's ours!

27:14.869 --> 27:19.067
The runway was
a whopping 2.5 miles long.

27:19.069 --> 27:21.469
More than enough to max our cars.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.427
Hammond elected to go first.

27:26.429 --> 27:29.427
I'm always nervous
when he drives in a straight line.

27:29.429 --> 27:32.267
"Richard Hammond, can you drive
in a straight line down a runway?

27:32.269 --> 27:34.189
"Yes, what can possibly go
wrong with that?"

27:35.349 --> 27:38.987
Hit the launch control button
with it, in race and manual.

27:38.989 --> 27:42.067
Give it max revs, my right foot.
ENGINE REVS

27:42.069 --> 27:43.949
Left foot off.
Right, we're away!

27:45.149 --> 27:47.827
It does the first gear
change for me, now it's up to me,

27:47.829 --> 27:49.947
and already we're doing 85, 90...

27:49.949 --> 27:54.227
100 miles an hour, that quickly.

27:54.229 --> 27:55.589
Damn, this thing is fast!

27:58.989 --> 28:01.427
Oh, look at the dust cloud.

28:01.429 --> 28:04.627
138, 141.

28:04.629 --> 28:08.187
I can hear the grit
hitting the underside of the car.
There's a lot of it.

28:08.189 --> 28:12.707
Seventh gear has just been hit.
175 miles an hour.

28:12.709 --> 28:13.787
Still accelerating hard.

28:13.789 --> 28:18.427
I can see the line, 186...87, 88.

28:18.429 --> 28:20.227
Come on, Ferrari, accelerate!

28:20.229 --> 28:25.229
Now that is a Ferrari at full chat.
90. 91.

28:26.509 --> 28:27.509
92.

28:28.549 --> 28:31.347
92, 93.

28:31.349 --> 28:34.469
193 miles an hour.
Top speed achieved.

28:36.429 --> 28:38.107
Next up, it was James,

28:38.109 --> 28:42.587
who decided to use absolutely
all of the available space.

28:42.589 --> 28:47.067
Right, here we go. Sport,
sport suspension, air con is off.

28:47.069 --> 28:50.069
Manual one. Here we go at the max.

28:53.869 --> 28:56.867
Right, here he comes now.
Captain Slow is his name.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.629
Or the Italians call him
"Mr Slowly".

29:01.749 --> 29:03.747
That's 80.

29:03.749 --> 29:06.347
I know at some point in that car,
when he's doing his run,

29:06.349 --> 29:08.147
he is saying, "buffeting".

29:08.149 --> 29:09.949
Buffeting.

29:11.629 --> 29:15.067
He's moving along
in the right direction.

29:15.069 --> 29:17.947
It's weird to think James May
in that, doing that speed.

29:17.949 --> 29:19.589
A spaniel in control of that.

29:21.349 --> 29:24.309
Indicated 175, 177. Come on!

29:28.069 --> 29:30.989
That said 186.

29:32.149 --> 29:35.347
Knowing that modern-day
speedos are frighteningly accurate,

29:35.349 --> 29:40.467
I knew what speed I had to beat -
Hammond's, 193.

29:40.469 --> 29:47.029
OK, launch control. First gear.
Press launch. Launch active.

29:48.589 --> 29:50.907
Three, two, one. Go!

29:50.909 --> 29:53.389
Oh, wow, that's quick!

29:55.549 --> 29:57.669
80 miles an hour already.

29:59.109 --> 30:02.389
Here he comes.
He's moving at tremendous speed.

30:05.189 --> 30:09.187
140. I'm taking manual control now

30:09.189 --> 30:10.467
to lock in in six.

30:10.469 --> 30:13.267
I don't want to go into seventh

30:13.269 --> 30:16.427
because that will slow it down.

30:16.429 --> 30:19.227
Come on! 191, 193.

30:19.229 --> 30:24.627
194, 195, 196, 197.

30:24.629 --> 30:26.147
197 again.

30:26.149 --> 30:30.349
Well, I'm through
and I've indicated...198.

30:31.949 --> 30:34.069
Victory, therefore, is mine.

30:35.389 --> 30:37.707
'Annoyingly,
though, we weren't finished,

30:37.709 --> 30:40.309
'because James had come up
with an idea.'

30:41.189 --> 30:43.707
It's a drag race,
but because of the weather,

30:43.709 --> 30:46.547
especially what it's doing today,
you have to start

30:46.549 --> 30:50.987
with your roof down and you have to
finish with your roof up.

30:50.989 --> 30:55.067
And that's not quite as simple
as it sounds. Well, no, it isn't.

30:55.069 --> 31:00.147
Because I can operate this roof
while I'm driving. So can I.

31:00.149 --> 31:04.307
He can't. You can't. No, Ferrari,
you have to... You have to stop.

31:04.309 --> 31:07.387
Which means... Hang on! No,
actually this is quite interesting.

31:07.389 --> 31:11.707
I can do 19 miles an hour
and put the roof up.

31:11.709 --> 31:14.107
How fast can you go? 31.

31:14.109 --> 31:17.747
You're joking?
But officially, your roof, I think,
goes up in 14 seconds.

31:17.749 --> 31:20.987
Mine is about 19.
This is very complicated.

31:20.989 --> 31:22.589
So, the flag drops. Yes.

31:23.629 --> 31:26.267
I set off,
but I can only go 19 miles an hour,

31:26.269 --> 31:28.667
while the roof is coming up.
Then I can go. Yup.

31:28.669 --> 31:32.867
You can go to 31 miles an hour...
But I have to stay there for longer.

31:32.869 --> 31:37.387
Because your roof takes
longer to go up. You can't set off
at all until your roof is up.

31:37.389 --> 31:41.109
But then... Go like hell.
Yeah, you launch control
and go like hell. Yeah.

31:43.029 --> 31:45.307
Having settled on a half-mile
distance,

31:45.309 --> 31:48.869
we lined up, and our Spanish starter
began the countdown.

31:50.189 --> 31:52.189
Tres, dos, uno...

31:55.509 --> 31:57.827
We begin, we begin, we begin.
I daren't put it in launch.

31:57.829 --> 32:00.867
They're moving away,
I'm not going anywhere!

32:00.869 --> 32:02.987
Less than 19.

32:02.989 --> 32:06.867
18 miles an hour. 19. 18.

32:06.869 --> 32:08.189
Come on, hurry up!

32:09.389 --> 32:11.949
Oh, I have exceeded
the roof speed. Argh!

32:13.869 --> 32:15.467
Bang!

32:15.469 --> 32:19.027
Oh, God. Struggling for grip.
Windows are going up now.

32:19.029 --> 32:21.829
Roof latched! I am away!

32:24.469 --> 32:29.269
I've passed James. Ha-ha!
Ha-ha! Oh BLEEP!

32:33.109 --> 32:34.109
I did that wrong.

32:37.229 --> 32:39.469
We lined up for a second attempt.

32:41.949 --> 32:45.787
Right, glasses on so I can read
when the roof is latched.

32:45.789 --> 32:49.189
Right, keep your finger on the
button and concentrate on the speed.

32:56.629 --> 33:01.147
Here we go. Keep it below 19 miles
an hour, Jeremy. 18, 19.

33:01.149 --> 33:04.187
I wait until the roof is up and just
before the back hatch goes down,

33:04.189 --> 33:06.987
I'm going to hit the launch control
button. There.

33:06.989 --> 33:08.507
Oh, come on!

33:08.509 --> 33:11.027
This feels astonishingly slow.

33:11.029 --> 33:13.787
19, oh, 20.
Roof operation in progress.

33:13.789 --> 33:15.549
That's down. I can go now.

33:20.949 --> 33:21.949
Roof closed!

33:26.029 --> 33:30.747
I'm changing gear with my left hand.
How multi-tasking was that?

33:30.749 --> 33:34.507
I am passing James May.
They're getting closer to the line.

33:34.509 --> 33:36.067
I think Jeremy is going to cross now.

33:36.069 --> 33:40.587
But I'm getting closer to the Audi
by the second. Hammond's coming!

33:40.589 --> 33:43.267
I'm going to get him,
I'm going to get him!

33:43.269 --> 33:45.987
Second. Oh-ho-ho!

33:45.989 --> 33:47.829
Victory has been mine.

33:52.789 --> 33:56.027
Weirdly, though,
James had a different view.

33:56.029 --> 33:58.667
The Audi's basically won
all of that.

33:58.669 --> 34:02.787
I'm sorry James, I think
you'll find the McLaren
got there miles before you.

34:02.789 --> 34:08.507
Highest top speed, McLaren.
So the McLaren has won both things.

34:08.509 --> 34:11.786
However, could I draw your attention
to a few things?

34:11.789 --> 34:15.706
A completely ruined back wheel,
same on the other side.

34:15.708 --> 34:17.147
I don't need to remind you of that.

34:17.149 --> 34:21.147
Up here we find a very badly chipped
windscreen. Hammond did that.

34:21.149 --> 34:23.507
It doesn't matter who did it,
it's very badly chipped.

34:23.509 --> 34:28.907
YOU also have a very badly chipped
windscreen. Where is it? Over there.

34:28.909 --> 34:30.547
You have ruined wheels.

34:30.549 --> 34:33.266
If you look down here, our cameraman
wants to come and see this.

34:33.268 --> 34:37.228
This bit of the bodywork
has actually been eaten away.

34:38.789 --> 34:41.786
'And that wasn't the only problem
caused by the dust

34:41.789 --> 34:43.629
'and grit on the unused runway.'

34:45.789 --> 34:47.627
Oh, look underneath!

34:47.629 --> 34:49.706
Oh, God!

34:49.708 --> 34:53.746
The Audi, meanwhile,
was totally unmarked.

34:53.748 --> 34:56.827
Why do the Germans put paint on
in such a way that it doesn't

34:56.829 --> 34:58.027
then come off?

34:58.029 --> 35:01.829
Because they are Germans and it is
impossible to paint a car badly.

35:03.629 --> 35:06.707
Conceding James' point,
we got back on the road

35:06.709 --> 35:10.629
and with evening approaching, it was
time to look for somewhere to stay.

35:12.949 --> 35:20.909
Chaps? Yes. I've had yet another
brilliant idea. Have you? What?

35:22.269 --> 35:24.387
Well,
instead of looking for a hotel,

35:24.389 --> 35:28.269
why don't we just go into the next
town and help ourselves to a house?

35:30.789 --> 35:32.267
OK.

35:32.269 --> 35:34.669
It's not a bad idea.

35:36.429 --> 35:38.787
In the next town,
we started househunting,

35:38.789 --> 35:44.109
and frankly we were spoilt for
choice. I would quite like a view.

35:45.149 --> 35:48.469
Well, that one's garden's all
overgrown. I don't fancy that.

35:49.549 --> 35:51.069
I don't want one with a dog.

35:52.869 --> 35:57.987
How about 53? Do you like 53? Or 55?

35:57.989 --> 36:00.509
As a number, I prefer 55.

36:02.749 --> 36:07.427
'With that settled, we moved in.'
Oh, it's nice!

36:07.429 --> 36:09.069
Oh, no. Junk mail.

36:11.269 --> 36:14.427
Is this a bedroom?
I'm going to have this.

36:14.429 --> 36:17.467
Hasn't actually got a bed in it,
but that'll be all right.

36:17.469 --> 36:23.587
Wow, look at this! I've got a bath,
bidet, bog. Hammond?

36:23.589 --> 36:27.827
Yes? We've found your room. Let
me guess, is it small? It's low.

36:27.829 --> 36:31.667
It's not. Oh, it's an en suite.
Look at that!

36:31.669 --> 36:33.589
I'm happy with that.

36:35.589 --> 36:38.427
'Having brightened the place up
with some decorations,

36:38.429 --> 36:42.587
'Jeremy cooked us a paella
while we discussed our cars.'

36:42.589 --> 36:45.467
If we have to identify the best
budget supercar, it's the Audi,

36:45.469 --> 36:46.867
there's no question about it.

36:46.869 --> 36:51.547
If you have to identify the best
car, it's the Ferrari. No, no, no.

36:51.549 --> 36:55.387
It isn't. Yes, it is. Well, it
isn't. The McLaren is a better car.

36:55.389 --> 36:59.587
It's not a better supercar. You
didn't say supercar. You said car.

36:59.589 --> 37:01.267
OK, best supercar.

37:01.269 --> 37:04.307
Well, now you see that
the best supercar is the Ferrari.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.787
The best car is the McLaren.
Yeah, but if I'm buying a supercar,
I'm buying...

37:07.789 --> 37:11.507
..and the winner of this test,
so far... is the Audi.

37:11.509 --> 37:12.587
..is the Audi.

37:12.589 --> 37:16.987
I'd go with that entirely. Yes.
Not very useful for the viewers.

37:16.989 --> 37:21.787
'With dinner served, we carried
on trying to reach a verdict.

37:21.789 --> 37:22.949
'But it was hopeless.'

37:24.109 --> 37:27.907
Yes, it is, but the Ferrari, they've
injected some magic into...

37:27.909 --> 37:30.947
With the roof off, it is properly
good. No way!

37:30.949 --> 37:32.829
£70,000 will buy a cook.

37:34.469 --> 37:39.509
Would it interfere with this debate
if I was suddenly and violently sick?

37:44.989 --> 37:49.747
He's waiting for a photo
to download on his computer.

37:49.749 --> 37:53.587
He's sitting there going,
"Buffering. Buffering."

37:53.589 --> 37:57.947
Now, look, we want to make it
absolutely clear,
that airport is not a film set.

37:57.949 --> 38:00.907
It opened five years ago,
then it went bust,

38:00.909 --> 38:03.227
then it closed down last year. Yeah.

38:03.229 --> 38:05.347
It's amazing, though,
if you think about it.

38:05.349 --> 38:08.307
We all have unused things
lying around -
I've got a bread maker and a wok -

38:08.309 --> 38:11.787
I haven't got an international
airport. No.

38:11.789 --> 38:15.067
About that, did you see what
that runway did to my Ferrari?

38:15.069 --> 38:17.627
Mmm, and you should see
what happens to it later on.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.227
Shouldn't we, Richard Hammond?

38:19.229 --> 38:21.867
I don't think you really want to
hang on and watch that.

38:21.869 --> 38:23.707
Maybe turn over to Countryfile, now.

38:23.709 --> 38:28.267
James... James, would you stay with
Top Gear, or switch over to see
Adam's farm. Let me have a think.

38:28.269 --> 38:30.867
Yes, I'd stay with Top Gear.
I'd stay with Top Gear.

38:30.869 --> 38:33.227
Anyway, that's then, this is now,

38:33.229 --> 38:36.747
and we must put a star
in our Reasonably Priced Car.

38:36.749 --> 38:40.827
Now, my guest, my guest tonight
is best known for dying

38:40.829 --> 38:47.587
and then coming back to life.
But it is not the baby Jesus.
LAUGHTER

38:47.589 --> 38:50.147
It is the man who played
Sherlock Holmes on the television.

38:50.149 --> 38:53.309
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Benedict Cumberbatch.

39:04.149 --> 39:06.147
Have a seat.
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

39:06.149 --> 39:08.147
Wow. Thank you very much.

39:08.149 --> 39:12.187
Now, that was a welcome.

39:12.189 --> 39:16.827
That was a welcome from a lot
of people who want to know

39:16.829 --> 39:18.747
how you're not dead?

39:18.749 --> 39:22.227
Well, when I jump off, there's
a helicopter with Mycroft

39:22.229 --> 39:24.907
in it dressed as a woman
and an inflatable skirt.

39:24.909 --> 39:28.187
And then he takes a pill,
which basically
means that the helicopter...

39:28.189 --> 39:30.107
I'm not going to tell anyone.
I can't.

39:30.109 --> 39:32.307
Oh, no, I was really enjoying that!

39:32.309 --> 39:35.187
Cos it was obviously
one of the most written-about

39:35.189 --> 39:38.547
and talked-about events in modern
television history.

39:38.549 --> 39:40.307
I wasn't here.

39:40.309 --> 39:41.547
I sort of missed it.

39:41.549 --> 39:43.987
The furore at home, anyway.
I was abroad.

39:43.989 --> 39:45.827
I heard that it went on for weeks.

39:45.829 --> 39:49.387
It did, you actually fell off a
building and then you're not dead.

39:49.389 --> 39:50.507
Yeah.

39:50.509 --> 39:52.827
Then we saw you dead, but anyway...
Yeah.

39:52.829 --> 39:55.387
When do you find out how that
had been achieved?

39:55.389 --> 39:58.547
I think it'll be some time near
the end of this year,

39:58.549 --> 40:01.107
or at the beginning of next.
That's what we're aiming for.

40:01.109 --> 40:04.667
Obviously, more recently, we've seen
you in the new Star Trek movie.
Yeah.

40:04.669 --> 40:05.987
Anyone seen that?

40:05.989 --> 40:08.027
Yes! Absolutely.

40:08.029 --> 40:11.747
And you are a damn good baddie, if I
may be so bold. Thank you very much.

40:11.749 --> 40:16.307
It does beg the question, why are
the Americans incapable of casting

40:16.309 --> 40:19.107
an American as the baddie in any
film? I don't know.

40:19.109 --> 40:22.867
I had a sort of pet theory that they
do vowels, which are sort of warm

40:22.869 --> 40:24.987
and loving and feeling, and we do
consonants,

40:24.989 --> 40:27.227
which are sharp and
intelligent and thinking.

40:27.229 --> 40:30.707
That's as hippy, mad,
leftfield as I can get with it.

40:30.709 --> 40:32.267
We sound more intelligent?

40:32.269 --> 40:34.829
Sort of, and maybe that's
scary for them, I don't know!

40:35.829 --> 40:37.267
End of my US career!

40:37.269 --> 40:38.467
Yes, I was going to say!

40:38.469 --> 40:41.507
One of the things I must ask is, now
that you've appeared in Star Trek,

40:41.509 --> 40:44.227
do you find yourself being
approached

40:44.229 --> 40:46.747
by those of a Trekkie disposition?

40:46.749 --> 40:48.627
The ones I have
met are remarkably normal.

40:48.629 --> 40:52.947
It is a bit like, "I-I'm quite
a Trekkie fan, actually." You are?

40:52.949 --> 40:55.347
No, that was me pretending
to be one.

40:55.349 --> 40:58.907
Oh, OK! You're such a good actor,
I thought actually you were one!

40:58.909 --> 41:01.267
Fooled you there, Jeremy!
Fooled you there!

41:01.269 --> 41:03.507
I wasn't, actually,
I wasn't a Trekkie.

41:03.509 --> 41:06.547
I watched the first film, I was very
into that, and then I obviously did

41:06.549 --> 41:10.627
a little bit of research as far as
what I was about to do in the canon,

41:10.629 --> 41:13.627
and I really got into it.
It was great to be a part of it.

41:13.629 --> 41:15.827
You do worry about saying that you
like Star Trek,

41:15.829 --> 41:18.387
but I've always liked it, ever since
it was Kirk and Spock,

41:18.389 --> 41:20.387
right the way through,
Jean-Luc Picard.

41:20.389 --> 41:23.187
Yeah, it's a great relationship.
A great relationship. Yeah... No?

41:23.189 --> 41:24.867
I don't see that -
what relationship?

41:24.869 --> 41:27.587
Between Kirk, Spock and Bones.
I think those three...

41:27.589 --> 41:30.067
This is it, if I talk about
a relationship between two men

41:30.069 --> 41:31.749
in a drama, they're immediately
at it.

41:33.069 --> 41:35.667
The worldwide inter-lie will just
go, splat,

41:35.669 --> 41:38.467
there's a load of fan fiction which
has me and John Watson

41:38.469 --> 41:41.149
floating in space in a bed,
handcuffed to one another.

41:42.869 --> 41:44.747
Not just with handcuffs either!

41:44.749 --> 41:47.629
I could write that tonight,
it would be fun!

41:49.549 --> 41:53.267
You're from an acting family. I am,
my mum and dad are both actors.

41:53.269 --> 41:56.467
Mum... Both, actually... My car
history sort of begins with them.

41:56.469 --> 41:58.427
I sort of was introduced to
cars by them...

41:58.429 --> 42:02.267
It's interesting, we've got
a photograph of your mum here, look.
Yep.

42:02.269 --> 42:05.187
Now, my mum didn't have
a car like that.

42:05.189 --> 42:07.507
That's quite cool. It's very cool.

42:07.509 --> 42:10.227
Is that from a Gerry Anderson?
It is, it's from UFO.

42:10.229 --> 42:11.747
Yeah. No, she was in UFO?

42:11.749 --> 42:15.067
She was in UFO. So that obviously
wasn't her car, that is a...?

42:15.069 --> 42:18.547
No, but she did drive it, and it was
driveable. She had an MGT...

42:18.549 --> 42:20.347
An MGB, I should say, a hatchback.

42:20.349 --> 42:22.387
Not a hatchback,
sorry - a soft top. Yeah.

42:22.389 --> 42:23.787
But all cars before I was born...

42:23.789 --> 42:25.707
When I was born,
it all got a bit sensible.

42:25.709 --> 42:27.629
She had a Mini, which was great.

42:28.949 --> 42:30.467
Cos that was my first car.
Was it? Yeah.

42:30.469 --> 42:32.507
Your first car was actually
a proper Mini, then?

42:32.509 --> 42:33.907
A little Mini. Crash it?

42:33.909 --> 42:36.507
No, but I did reverse after
a night out

42:36.509 --> 42:38.947
over a very large rock on a driveway

42:38.949 --> 42:42.947
and the gearstick just went,
"Thunk," right through the chassis
of the car.

42:42.949 --> 42:44.189
So, next car was a...?

42:45.549 --> 42:48.947
A Golf Mitsubishi Colt from 1982,
hatchback. A Golf?

42:48.949 --> 42:51.347
Yeah. No, not a Golf, sorry.
Mitsubishi Colt.

42:51.349 --> 42:53.869
So, your MGT
and a Golf Mitsubishi! Yeah!

42:55.189 --> 42:58.747
I'm getting my... I'm cross-splicing
in some future world of cars!

42:58.749 --> 43:00.707
There's a lot of car
jumbling going on!

43:00.709 --> 43:03.347
It's a good job I don't do
your job - I'd be rubbish at it.

43:03.349 --> 43:05.187
It's a good job I don't do yours -

43:05.189 --> 43:08.147
I've no idea how to fly a spaceship
or punch anyone.

43:08.149 --> 43:11.427
Or act. That can be taught. I got
taught that. What, how to punch?

43:11.429 --> 43:13.907
Yeah. Hollywood fu, it was great
fun.

43:13.909 --> 43:17.867
Do you punch like... Do you punch
with that side of your hand?

43:17.869 --> 43:19.507
What are you doing? When you punch.

43:19.509 --> 43:22.427
You look like you're trying to wipe
a windscreen or something.

43:22.429 --> 43:25.227
No, when you punch somebody,
cos I've often... You sometimes...

43:25.229 --> 43:27.947
Normally, you're quite tight and
it's all from the waist,

43:27.949 --> 43:31.347
but you have to sell it a bit more
for the camera, so you arc it round
a bit.

43:31.349 --> 43:34.947
You could try it. Shall we try it
now? Shall we try a fake punch?

43:34.949 --> 43:36.507
Yeah!

43:36.509 --> 43:38.427
What if it turns into a real one?

43:38.429 --> 43:40.869
I'll give and you receive.

43:43.429 --> 43:45.027
I like being the dominant one.

43:45.029 --> 43:46.947
So, there's the camera. That one?

43:46.949 --> 43:50.067
Facing me. You're actually directing
now! Yeah! Facing you...

43:50.069 --> 43:51.827
Am I ready for this punch? Yeah.

43:51.829 --> 43:55.189
When I get to about there, you can
move your head. But what if I don't?

43:56.909 --> 43:58.307
I'm not going to do that.

43:58.309 --> 44:01.509
Is anybody... Your dry-cleaning
bills when my nose...!

44:02.549 --> 44:04.067
All right. Are you ready? Yes.

44:04.069 --> 44:05.949
OK, and...

44:08.709 --> 44:10.509
Did that look all right?
He knows, they know.

44:14.949 --> 44:17.867
We've had many actors on the show
over the years, sitting there,

44:17.869 --> 44:20.387
but we've never had one who's been
carjacked before.

44:20.389 --> 44:22.587
Oh, really? That's good.

44:22.589 --> 44:24.947
It is, but you were genuinely
carjacked.

44:24.949 --> 44:26.947
I was genuinely carjacked. Yeah.

44:26.949 --> 44:28.467
Scary? How did it happen?

44:28.469 --> 44:29.867
It was very scary.

44:29.869 --> 44:32.987
I have to emphasise,
not just because I love South Africa

44:32.989 --> 44:34.187
and South Africans,

44:34.189 --> 44:37.827
but it was a small event in a very
big country, and we were very lucky.

44:37.829 --> 44:40.787
We were on a bumpy dirt track
and had gone onto the N2,

44:40.789 --> 44:43.627
the major trunk
road down the east coast,

44:43.629 --> 44:47.547
and the front right tyre blew
and these guys surrounded us,

44:47.549 --> 44:51.307
stuff went on with belongings
and we were pushed about a bit.

44:51.309 --> 44:53.667
I was put in the boot of the car,
though, at one point,

44:53.669 --> 44:55.467
and that was interesting.

44:55.469 --> 44:58.467
I thought, "Maybe I could diffuse
the brake lights,

44:58.469 --> 44:59.547
"then the police..."

44:59.549 --> 45:02.747
No, no policeman in South Africa
is going to pull over a car

45:02.749 --> 45:05.987
full of men at midnight to
question a broken taillight.

45:05.989 --> 45:08.627
But it was very scary.

45:08.629 --> 45:12.187
When they got you out again, did
they not put a duvet over your head?

45:12.189 --> 45:14.747
At one point,
stuff was being thrown out the car.

45:14.749 --> 45:16.907
We were underneath this underpass

45:16.909 --> 45:19.787
and these juggernauts were just
charging over

45:19.789 --> 45:22.227
and the sound cover
would be perfect for a quiet pop.

45:22.229 --> 45:25.587
Then this duvet got thrown out, just
went over our head, and I thought,

45:25.589 --> 45:27.267
"Again, it's the pillow thing,

45:27.269 --> 45:29.747
"it's going to be a muffler for
a gunshot."

45:29.749 --> 45:31.947
So I kind of came to terms
with mortality

45:31.949 --> 45:35.467
and dying on my own about four
times in the space of half an hour.

45:35.469 --> 45:37.467
The whole thing
went on for about two hours.

45:37.469 --> 45:40.147
We mustn't put people off southern
Africa. No, we mustn't.

45:40.149 --> 45:41.707
It's a big, beautiful place. It is.

45:41.709 --> 45:44.669
So we could just ignore all that, it
doesn't really happen! Cut that!

45:45.909 --> 45:49.149
Anyway, so, you came down here to
do your lap. Oh, BLEEP!

45:50.949 --> 45:53.067
And how was it out there?
It was really good fun.

45:53.069 --> 45:55.947
The first couple of laps, I couldn't
see the wood for the trees,

45:55.949 --> 45:57.547
but as it went on, I think I got...

45:57.549 --> 45:58.867
I bettered my times later on,

45:58.869 --> 46:01.347
so I was obviously learning
something. How do you know?

46:01.349 --> 46:03.027
People would go, "Mmm."

46:03.029 --> 46:05.027
Oh, just from people's "Mmm"?

46:05.029 --> 46:08.187
I'm told you did more laps than
any guest we've had.

46:08.189 --> 46:10.227
Oh, that's so shaming!

46:10.229 --> 46:12.747
Who'd like to see the fastest lap?

46:12.749 --> 46:13.749
Yeah!

46:14.789 --> 46:16.667
Let's have a look.

46:16.669 --> 46:17.907
OK.

46:17.909 --> 46:18.949
Oh, yes.

46:21.069 --> 46:22.069
We are away.

46:23.509 --> 46:25.309
Yippee ki-yay, mother-BLEEP!

46:26.869 --> 46:28.469
A fan of The Hangover is here!

46:29.549 --> 46:33.189
Look at it grip,
with a lifetime warranty.

46:35.629 --> 46:37.869
That's not bad.
Is that all right? Yeah.

46:38.869 --> 46:39.909
It is hot in here.

46:40.949 --> 46:42.547
That's no excuse, come on.

46:42.549 --> 46:46.147
Did you have the air conditioning
off or on? Off. Good man.

46:46.149 --> 46:49.347
A bit wide through there,
maybe costing you half a second.

46:49.349 --> 46:53.469
Gear change, gear change, gear
change, gear change. So... boom.

46:55.429 --> 46:58.869
Yeah, like the Sundance Kid there,
very quick mover! Oh, God!

47:00.709 --> 47:02.827
Bit slow, but at least you're not
skidding about.

47:02.829 --> 47:06.187
You haven't really used all
the track - or, indeed, any of it.
Anyway...

47:06.189 --> 47:09.069
Use the track, Benedict.

47:11.149 --> 47:15.747
Ladies and gentlemen, Alec Guinness
in the Reasonably Priced Car!

47:15.749 --> 47:17.507
Moved those, that was well done.

47:17.509 --> 47:19.987
And now here it is,
second-to-last corner.

47:19.989 --> 47:21.547
Holy crap, this is scary.

47:21.549 --> 47:24.387
No, that is
pretty much perfect. Is it?

47:24.389 --> 47:26.747
That really is perfect, Gambon.

47:26.749 --> 47:29.949
Ooh, fast. Ooh, fast,
but not Jimmy Carr. Across the line!

47:35.189 --> 47:38.109
Ah, not bad! That is all right.
That is all right.

47:41.269 --> 47:44.827
These are the times we have so far
in our Reasonably Priced Car.

47:44.829 --> 47:45.787
Ooh, crikey.

47:45.789 --> 47:47.427
Where do we think?

47:47.429 --> 47:48.987
I don't know, I don't know.

47:48.989 --> 47:51.467
Maybe faster than Warwick, I'd be
happy with that.

47:51.469 --> 47:54.147
Faster than Warwick, at 1:46.8.

47:54.149 --> 47:57.227
That's where you're aiming.
That's very high, isn't it?

47:57.229 --> 48:00.989
Benedict Cumberbatch,
you... are leaning forwards.

48:02.069 --> 48:03.827
It won't make my time faster,
will it?!

48:03.829 --> 48:06.707
I haven't got much space
left on here!

48:06.709 --> 48:08.309
Then shorten the time!

48:09.789 --> 48:11.029
You did it in one...

48:13.029 --> 48:14.709
..40...

48:20.269 --> 48:21.469
..7.8.

48:23.149 --> 48:24.549
Oh! So you're not faster.

48:31.469 --> 48:33.749
I can live with that.
It's in the middle.

48:34.909 --> 48:37.627
What I've got here is a list of all
the other people who've

48:37.629 --> 48:39.547
appeared on Star Trek.

48:39.549 --> 48:41.987
If it makes you feel any better,

48:41.989 --> 48:45.107
Jean-Luc Picard, 1:50 dead.
Oh, dear.

48:45.109 --> 48:47.267
So you're faster than he was.

48:47.269 --> 48:51.427
But the previous baddie in the last
film, Eric Bana, 1:47.5,

48:51.429 --> 48:53.107
and that was in the wet.

48:53.109 --> 48:54.627
Phwoar. So Eric Bana is faster.

48:54.629 --> 48:56.667
I can't really find any
comfort at all for you.

48:56.669 --> 48:59.227
I've just got to come back,
you've got to invite me back.

48:59.229 --> 49:01.707
I basically brought you down here
and ruined your day.

49:01.709 --> 49:03.387
Yeah, yeah! I do apologise for that,

49:03.389 --> 49:06.347
because it has been an enormous
pleasure. Likewise, thank you.

49:06.349 --> 49:08.667
Best of luck with the new Sherlock,
absolute joy.

49:08.669 --> 49:10.829
Ladies and gentlemen,
Benedict Cumberbatch.

49:22.749 --> 49:24.987
Now, tonight, we are heading for
Madrid

49:24.989 --> 49:26.947
in three convertible supercars.

49:26.949 --> 49:30.827
So far, we've found Spain to be
full of brand-new things that

49:30.829 --> 49:32.507
nobody seems to be using.

49:32.509 --> 49:35.787
Absolutely. We spent
the night in an unwanted house,

49:35.789 --> 49:39.147
where Jeremy had cooked us dinner.

49:39.149 --> 49:41.469
Anyway, we rejoin the action
the following morning.

49:47.989 --> 49:51.029
'After a hectic night on the
lavatory, we headed off.

49:52.349 --> 49:54.349
'But after just 100 yards...'

49:55.989 --> 49:57.589
Oh, I've ruined my Ferrari.

49:59.349 --> 50:01.547
'..I hit a bollard.

50:01.549 --> 50:05.627
'Luckily, though, my colleagues
didn't make a big deal of it.'

50:05.629 --> 50:09.627
Hammond, look out for that signpost
dead ahead of you. Hammond, careful.

50:09.629 --> 50:11.787
Block of flats on the right.

50:11.789 --> 50:12.829
Please kill me.

50:14.789 --> 50:17.749
Breaking a Ferrari is
an especially bad thing.

50:19.069 --> 50:21.987
It's like kicking a rabbit.

50:21.989 --> 50:24.787
Hammond, when we get on
the motorway,

50:24.789 --> 50:26.027
you'll be driving quite fast,

50:26.029 --> 50:29.309
it might be 70 miles an hour, you'll
really need to concentrate there.

50:36.549 --> 50:38.347
Hammond, move right, mind the Armco.

50:38.349 --> 50:39.669
They're never going to give up.

50:42.789 --> 50:44.989
'Sure enough,
the abuse kept on coming.'

50:46.349 --> 50:49.987
Two big metal pillars, Hammond.
Don't... Do you see them? Mind that!

50:49.989 --> 50:51.949
That way! You're all right.

50:55.189 --> 51:00.147
'Happily, after several uneventful
miles on yet another empty motorway,

51:00.149 --> 51:02.469
'we were finally approaching Madrid.'

51:05.989 --> 51:09.427
I know capital cities often escape
the worst of austerity times

51:09.429 --> 51:12.629
like these, so hopefully that'll
still be a busy old place.

51:13.989 --> 51:16.109
'However...'

51:29.629 --> 51:30.669
Holy God.

51:31.869 --> 51:32.869
Look at it.

51:35.029 --> 51:36.629
There are thousands of them.

51:41.269 --> 51:44.189
This crash was clearly bigger
than ever I realised.

51:49.069 --> 51:52.589
Still, look on the upside - there's
no-one for Hammond to run over.

51:55.269 --> 51:58.349
'And that thought gave me
yet another brilliant idea.'

52:00.189 --> 52:03.867
Nobody is driving on that road.

52:03.869 --> 52:07.227
So what are you suggesting?
Or that road.

52:07.229 --> 52:12.067
What I'm saying is, we turn this
town into a street circuit.

52:12.069 --> 52:16.347
Ship The Stig out, he sets a time in
a car of some sort

52:16.349 --> 52:18.307
and we try and match it.

52:18.309 --> 52:19.987
It's an ambitious plan.

52:19.989 --> 52:21.587
How hard can it be?

52:21.589 --> 52:25.707
A few tyres, bits of barrier.
That's an excellent grandstand.

52:25.709 --> 52:29.227
All the residents - if there were
any - could sit on those balconies
and watch.

52:29.229 --> 52:32.467
Bernie Ecclestone will now be
leaning forward in his chair and
going,

52:32.469 --> 52:34.227
"Good idea."

52:34.229 --> 52:37.149
This is the Madrid Grand Prix,
coming up.

52:38.309 --> 52:40.427
'Having sorted out a course,

52:40.429 --> 52:43.589
'James and I set about making
it into an actual track.'

52:46.389 --> 52:49.149
I can't do them regular
if you're going that fast!

52:50.349 --> 52:52.789
It's uphill. Yeah.
Keep going! Yeah, yeah.

52:55.309 --> 52:57.707
This is Ferrari rosso.

52:57.709 --> 52:59.067
So when you crash into it,

52:59.069 --> 53:02.509
this will effectively repair
the damage you've done to your car.

53:04.869 --> 53:07.027
'Because of my problem with
manual labour,

53:07.029 --> 53:08.629
'I went off to collect The Stig.'

53:16.349 --> 53:17.589
So, this is the start, yeah?

53:18.989 --> 53:21.947
Careful. So this one goes...

53:21.949 --> 53:25.229
James, just do them when I'm...

53:26.949 --> 53:28.707
..getting the...

53:28.709 --> 53:31.269
No! That's... What the bloody hell?

53:33.069 --> 53:34.907
Oops.

53:34.909 --> 53:36.587
Ah, he's here.

53:36.589 --> 53:38.547
The Stig's here.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.549
Is he all right?

53:43.189 --> 53:48.587
'With the circuit complete and
christened, we unwrapped The Stig

53:48.589 --> 53:52.909
'so he could set a benchmark time in
a supercharged Jaguar convertible.'

53:55.829 --> 53:59.107
Right, are you ready with
the stopwatch, James May? Yes, I am.

53:59.109 --> 54:01.667
Bradley Cooper will start it.

54:01.669 --> 54:05.069
Three, two, one!

54:07.549 --> 54:09.309
That's a dirty, dirty sound.

54:15.909 --> 54:18.147
Oh, look at that!
He's got his tail out,

54:18.149 --> 54:20.429
going round the Rockery of
Gibraltar.

54:23.709 --> 54:25.587
'Because this was a street circuit,

54:25.589 --> 54:27.909
'it was lined with wheel-killing
kerbs.

54:30.069 --> 54:32.069
'And there was even a speed hump.

54:34.549 --> 54:36.949
'But these things were of no
moment to The Stig.'

54:43.109 --> 54:48.267
Whoa! 57 and a half seconds.

54:48.269 --> 54:49.949
Right!

54:55.709 --> 54:58.387
'We then set off on a sighting lap,

54:58.389 --> 55:00.507
'knowing that
if we wanted to beat The Stig,

55:00.509 --> 55:04.589
'we'd have to average at least
60 miles an hour.'

55:06.149 --> 55:07.509
That is alarming there.

55:08.709 --> 55:11.267
'Even though our cars were faster
than the Jag,

55:11.269 --> 55:12.829
'it looked like a tall order.'

55:16.909 --> 55:19.907
OK, here we go, this is it,
you and me, little Ferrari.

55:19.909 --> 55:22.549
Now's our chance,
give it everything you've got.

55:24.309 --> 55:25.269
Three, two, one!

55:30.589 --> 55:31.669
Really fast start.

55:36.589 --> 55:39.309
On the limiter,
round the Rockery of Gibraltar.

55:49.509 --> 55:51.429
Turn it. This thing will grip,
Richard.

55:58.029 --> 56:00.949
Left that late. Back on the power
as soon as you can.

56:04.829 --> 56:06.747
That was quick.

56:06.749 --> 56:08.589
Now, the chicane. This is monstrous.

56:17.589 --> 56:19.749
Then, thread it through.
That is tight.

56:23.589 --> 56:26.389
And now the final straight,
up towards the finish line.

56:28.749 --> 56:30.949
This is all I've got,
everything I can.

56:32.909 --> 56:40.589
Little Fezza, I really hope I've made
up for crashing you this morning.

56:45.149 --> 56:48.069
'With my work done,
it was Mr Slowly's turn.'

56:49.309 --> 56:50.309
Three, two, one!

56:54.509 --> 56:55.789
Ooh, it sounds second!

56:57.789 --> 56:59.667
Third!

56:59.669 --> 57:01.789
James May, ladies
and gentlemen, hit third!

57:07.629 --> 57:11.029
There's a left-hander somewhere.
There it is. Throw him in.

57:18.829 --> 57:20.629
Lord Howard of Effingham.

57:22.709 --> 57:25.549
Oh, tricky gear change with
the gear... Oh, BLEEP!

57:29.149 --> 57:31.349
No-one expects the Spanish
speed hump.

57:40.029 --> 57:41.189
Nice and straight.

57:44.869 --> 57:46.269
Nearly bloody killed me.

57:50.309 --> 57:52.789
'Finally,
it was the turn of the McLaren.'

57:55.069 --> 57:56.309
Active, aero, sport.

57:57.349 --> 57:58.349
Well, this is it.

58:00.349 --> 58:01.349
Three, two, one!

58:05.509 --> 58:07.269
Whoa, that was launch control!

58:12.429 --> 58:14.069
Concentrate, Jeremy, concentrate.

58:16.189 --> 58:17.229
Oh, no!

58:19.069 --> 58:20.709
Massive tail slide there!

58:23.109 --> 58:25.069
And on to the Golden Hind straight.

58:29.389 --> 58:32.789
91 miles an hour there.
Down to second.

58:55.349 --> 58:56.349
Come on, power!

59:00.349 --> 59:01.429
Oooh!

59:09.429 --> 59:14.947
I have to say, our street circuit
was a million times better

59:14.949 --> 59:19.107
than Spain's other one in Valencia.
It's one of the most boring street
circuits in the world. Yeah.

59:19.109 --> 59:22.387
The only problem I had was,
you know the Lord Howard of
Effingham chicane? Yes.

59:22.389 --> 59:23.787
You really wanted first,

59:23.789 --> 59:27.427
but I couldn't ever get it in the
McLaren. Trying to jam it down.

59:27.429 --> 59:31.307
The problem I had is when you get to
the "no-one expects
the Spanish speed hump". Yeah.

59:31.309 --> 59:34.667
You had to go wide and try to hit it
reasonably square, cos if you got it
at an angle,

59:34.669 --> 59:38.867
you'd be banged into the kerb.
And then, you'd smash your wheel
off! Yeah, absolutely. Yes, yes!

59:38.869 --> 59:41.547
Anyway, I have the results here.

59:41.549 --> 59:43.949
And the... well, there's no other way
to put this...

59:45.429 --> 59:48.907
..the fastest car around
our magnificent track was...

59:48.909 --> 59:52.189
the Ferrari! Yeah, it was! It wasn't.

59:53.349 --> 59:55.827
No, it was, cos if you look,
there's the numbers

59:55.829 --> 59:58.747
next to the names, the one next to
mine is the smallest, that means...

59:58.749 --> 01:00:02.947
No, no, Hammond. The Ferrari was
the fastest in the first lap.

01:00:02.949 --> 01:00:06.667
Well, it was a one-lap event.
It wasn't a one-lap event!

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:09.427
No, cos then, we parcel
the cameras away, OK,

01:00:09.429 --> 01:00:12.587
and then we kept going,
as you remember, and by the end,

01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:15.827
the McLaren was not just faster
than the Ferrari,

01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:18.027
but faster than The Stig.

01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:21.267
But that wasn't the end, because then
The Stig went out again in the Jag

01:00:21.269 --> 01:00:25.627
and was faster than the McLaren. Yes.
Hang on, that wasn't the end either,
because, if you remember,

01:00:25.629 --> 01:00:28.747
it then started raining and in the
rain, the Audi was the fastest

01:00:28.749 --> 01:00:31.307
because of its four-wheel drive.
So...

01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:33.427
This isn't very good, is it?

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:35.027
Well, it's not very clear.

01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:37.787
No, what we're saying is,
at various different points,

01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:39.947
all of them were the fastest. Yeah.

01:00:39.949 --> 01:00:42.227
Anyway, I've got the results
of everything over here,

01:00:42.229 --> 01:00:43.627
all the categories.

01:00:43.629 --> 01:00:47.267
And speed, yes, we decided
that was a dead heat for all three.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:50.747
Well, no, I mean, on the night,
it was the Ferrari.
It wasn't the Ferrari...

01:00:50.749 --> 01:00:53.669
It was a one-lap event... It was
the McLa... Would you two shut up?

01:00:56.749 --> 01:01:01.027
Quietness, that was also a dead heat
between the Audi and the McLaren.

01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:04.147
Discretion, the Audi.

01:01:04.149 --> 01:01:06.507
Economy, that was the Audi.

01:01:06.509 --> 01:01:09.067
Value was the Audi, but...

01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:11.307
finally, equipment...

01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:12.709
that was the Audi.

01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:15.667
A bit clearer, isn't it?

01:01:15.669 --> 01:01:18.187
Fairly comprehensive win there
for the Audi. Uh-huh.

01:01:18.189 --> 01:01:21.827
So, James May, of the three cars,
knowing what we know now,

01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:24.107
which would you choose to buy?

01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:25.269
The Ferrari.

01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:28.947
Yeah, it's the Ferrari. And you?

01:01:28.949 --> 01:01:31.827
Uh... McLaren. Interesting. Really?

01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:34.107
No, I'd have the Ferrari. Good.

01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:36.827
I mean, the McLaren is absolutely
brilliant,

01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:39.787
but the Ferrari is just
a little bit more special.

01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:42.827
So what we're finally saying
is we'd all three have a car

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:45.509
that dissolves if you drive it
too quickly.

01:01:47.149 --> 01:01:48.747
Yes, yes.

01:01:48.749 --> 01:01:50.827
But on that bombshell, we can end.

01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:52.707
Thank you very much for watching.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.749
See you all again next week.
Take care, good night!
