Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i>

00:04.236 --> 00:05.453
All right,              
        here you go, Cliffie.

00:05.487 --> 00:06.655
How about       
                getting your mom

00:06.689 --> 00:08.623
a pair of these soothing,   
    gel-filled insoles,

00:08.658 --> 00:10.358
<i>and</i> odor eliminators.

00:10.392 --> 00:13.461
It's only her birthday,         
it's not Christmas.

00:13.495 --> 00:15.830
How about one of these
          Lucite snack trays

00:15.865 --> 00:17.832
that plays the theme
            from <i>Cats?</i>

00:17.867 --> 00:20.302
Yeah, Valentine's Day, 1963.

00:20.336 --> 00:23.038
Back then                       
it played "Exodus."

00:23.072 --> 00:24.705
Hummingbird feeder?

00:24.740 --> 00:27.525
Come on, you guys               
are just being silly            
now, right?

00:27.559 --> 00:28.827
Well, then, Cliff,
              I'm afraid

00:28.861 --> 00:32.330
you're going to spend   
        a little more than $1.99
        for your mom's gift.

00:32.363 --> 00:33.798
Yeah, you're right, Normie.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.300
You only turn 70 once.

00:36.602 --> 00:38.236
Speaking as a mom,

00:38.271 --> 00:39.671
you know, when        
          my kids give me gifts,

00:39.705 --> 00:41.572
the ones that always
            mean the most       
            to me are the ones

00:41.607 --> 00:42.941
they make themselves.

00:42.975 --> 00:46.611
For instance, look
              at this little    
              key chain here.

00:46.646 --> 00:49.680
Anthony made this for me the  
first year he went away to camp.

00:49.715 --> 00:52.117
I carried it with me
            ever since.

00:52.151 --> 00:54.835
I think it might be
             the most precious  
             thing I own.

00:54.870 --> 00:56.404
Well, I'll give you             
three bucks for it.

00:56.439 --> 00:58.473
Done.

Sam, you're working a big party 
the 26th at Mr. Gaines'.

02:11.530 --> 02:12.697
Another big party...

02:12.732 --> 02:15.100
How come you always     
        get roped into running  
        these things?

02:15.134 --> 02:16.167
I'm not running this.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.501
I'm just delivering             
the message.

02:17.536 --> 02:19.254
Yes, I will be attending    
        the party,

02:19.288 --> 02:20.522
but as an honored guest.

02:20.556 --> 02:23.224
An honored guest who happens to 
show up a couple of hours early

02:23.259 --> 02:25.326
and leave a couple hours late.

02:25.361 --> 02:27.295
And I will do as                
any other good guest will:

02:27.329 --> 02:31.032
help clean up,                  
and maybe park a few cars.

02:31.066 --> 02:33.134
So what's the shindig   
        for this time?

02:33.169 --> 02:36.103

Gee, I've never         
     been to one of those.

02:46.165 --> 02:47.215
Good.

02:47.249 --> 02:48.883
You're tending bar.

02:48.917 --> 02:49.917
There's the address.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.185
I'll see you at 10:00,
          Sunday morning.

02:51.220 --> 02:54.222
She played right into my hands.

02:58.194 --> 02:59.861
REBECCA:              
          If I do say so myself,

02:59.895 --> 03:01.462
I do throw     
                 a lovely party.

03:02.364 --> 03:03.815
Oh, Mr. Gaines,

03:03.849 --> 03:05.316
I don't believe     
            I've been introduced

03:05.350 --> 03:07.184
to the guest of honor,
          your lovely daughter.

03:07.219 --> 03:08.886
Oh, Kelly would love            
to meet you.

03:09.888 --> 03:13.725
Oh, she's busy.

03:13.759 --> 03:15.360
Jack Daniels, neat.

03:15.394 --> 03:17.144
SAM:                    
        Coming right up, sir.

03:17.179 --> 03:18.546
Say, aren't you Sam Malone?

03:18.581 --> 03:20.214
Didn't you used                 
to be a pitcher?

03:20.249 --> 03:21.549
Yep, that's me.

03:21.584 --> 03:23.084
Now you're doing this?

03:23.118 --> 03:24.335
Well,

03:24.369 --> 03:25.720
nothing wrong with tending bar.

03:25.754 --> 03:26.921
It's good, honest work.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.374
Uh, here's a little       
      something for you.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.818
Those rich snobs, man.

03:39.852 --> 03:42.954
They think they can look        
down their noses at you,

03:42.988 --> 03:44.655
and then make everything better 
by slipping you a measly...

03:44.690 --> 03:47.025
50 bucks?

03:49.945 --> 03:51.012
Two white wines,                
please.

03:51.047 --> 03:52.613
Yes, sir.               
     Coming right up here.

03:55.384 --> 03:57.519
You know, Woody, I tell ya,

03:57.553 --> 03:58.786
it's a long way

03:58.820 --> 04:00.688
from pitching                   
in the major leagues

04:00.722 --> 04:02.223
to slinging drinks.

04:03.509 --> 04:04.426
What am I gonna do,             
you know?

04:04.460 --> 04:06.978
I mean, life's dealt me         
this lousy hand.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.762
I guess I'm just
                gonna have

04:08.797 --> 04:10.081
to play it out, huh?

04:10.115 --> 04:11.949
I'm sorry, sir.

04:11.984 --> 04:13.384
Uh, there               
        are your drinks.

04:13.418 --> 04:14.502
Thank you.

04:14.536 --> 04:16.687
Oh, bless you.

04:21.392 --> 04:24.328
I'm definitely                  
on to something here.

04:27.399 --> 04:28.515
Excuse me,

04:28.550 --> 04:29.734
bartender.

04:29.768 --> 04:30.985
A little more champagne.

04:31.019 --> 04:32.370
Sure.

04:32.404 --> 04:34.839
Maybe I'll get  
                a tip, too, Sam.

04:34.874 --> 04:38.209
Listen, this whining for
        dollars routine is mine.

04:40.012 --> 04:43.314
Anyway, I'll be summering       
in D.C., God help me.

04:43.348 --> 04:45.149
Dad's favoring me               
with the option of going up

04:45.183 --> 04:47.552
on the Hill to page       
    or being a clerk.

04:47.586 --> 04:49.287
So what do you think?

04:49.321 --> 04:50.705
Oh, uh, excuse me   
            for interrupting,

04:50.739 --> 04:52.039
but I'd go         
             with the clerk job.

04:52.073 --> 04:56.177
I had a blast the summer I      
clerked at the Piggly Wiggly.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.480
Uh...

04:59.515 --> 05:00.581
I'm sure you did,

05:00.616 --> 05:03.951
but I was talking about
         being a legal clerk.

05:03.985 --> 05:06.087
Oh, this was all    
            in the up and up.

05:09.191 --> 05:11.226
Are you always this obtuse?

05:11.260 --> 05:12.576
The cummerbund

05:12.611 --> 05:15.079
makes my waist
                  look thick.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.483
Yeah...

05:19.517 --> 05:20.484
yeah, thick.

05:20.519 --> 05:22.370
That's the word     
            I was searching for.

05:22.404 --> 05:23.788
Write it on your hand.

05:23.822 --> 05:25.690
You'll never forget it.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.194
He's very funny.

05:31.363 --> 05:32.547
Well, here's to you,            
Malone.

05:32.581 --> 05:34.816
And, uh, I wish you             
lots of luck

05:34.850 --> 05:36.584
on that triple bypass.

05:38.654 --> 05:39.821
Thank you.

05:39.855 --> 05:41.356
Bless your heart.

05:44.326 --> 05:46.561
You having a       
             heart problem, Sam?

05:46.595 --> 05:50.030
Yeah, it feels like there's     
something pressing on it.

05:50.065 --> 05:52.933
Maybe like...                   
all this cash.

05:52.968 --> 05:56.971
( <i>speaking quietly</i> )

05:57.005 --> 05:59.840
Excuse me, uh, bartender.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.108
Can I give you                  
a little tip?

06:01.143 --> 06:04.378
Looking good, Sam.

06:04.412 --> 06:05.612
Sure.

06:05.647 --> 06:07.398
For the rest of the afternoon,

06:07.432 --> 06:09.533
just keep your mouth shut.

06:09.568 --> 06:11.152
Excuse me?

06:11.186 --> 06:15.557
You're here to work,      
not to chitchat with the guests.

06:15.591 --> 06:18.092
You think just     
             because you're rich

06:18.126 --> 06:19.827
you can boss people
             around?

06:19.861 --> 06:21.762
We've got guys like you
         back in Hanover.

06:21.797 --> 06:23.331
You know what   
                we call them?

06:23.365 --> 06:23.881
What?

06:23.915 --> 06:25.966
"Sir."

06:28.286 --> 06:31.055
But after we say it,
            we roll our eyes.

06:37.112 --> 06:39.714
You know, kid, you're really  
     starting to annoy me.

06:39.748 --> 06:41.348
I think I'm going           
to teach you some manners.

06:41.383 --> 06:42.583
Step outside.

06:42.618 --> 06:44.068
Uh, uh, I'm sorry, all right?

06:44.103 --> 06:45.269
I was out of line.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.737
I don't want to fight.

06:46.771 --> 06:48.756
Oh, you're not as           
      stupid as you look.

06:48.790 --> 06:51.558
Now I want to fight.

06:51.593 --> 06:53.127
Whoa, whoa, what's going    
         on here, man?

06:53.161 --> 06:56.497
This guy just said
              I wasn't as stupid
              as I look, Sam.

06:56.531 --> 06:59.333
Whoa, whoa, come here.

06:59.368 --> 07:00.801
Listen, whoa, whoa, stop.

07:00.835 --> 07:02.669
I mean it. Really, listen,      
    before you go out there,

07:02.704 --> 07:04.138
let me just say         
    a couple of things here.

07:04.172 --> 07:06.173
Now I've been a bartender   
    for quite a few years

07:06.207 --> 07:08.142
and I've broken up a lot
        of fights in my day.

07:08.176 --> 07:10.010
And I'll tell you           
no matter who's involved,

07:10.044 --> 07:12.446
whether they're rich guys       
         or poor guys,

07:12.481 --> 07:15.082
tall guys or short guys,

07:15.116 --> 07:17.451
fat guys, skinny guys,

07:17.486 --> 07:19.320
guys with speech impediments...

07:19.354 --> 07:21.288
What's your point?

07:21.323 --> 07:24.559
Well, the point is, that usually
  by this point in the story,

07:24.593 --> 07:26.827
the guys would forget      
    what they're angry about

07:26.862 --> 07:28.529
and they'd kind of wander away.

07:28.564 --> 07:32.150
Yeah, well, I, I, uh...

07:32.184 --> 07:34.451
I guess this isn't              
the right time or place.

07:34.486 --> 07:36.370
Yeah, you're right.

07:36.405 --> 07:37.821
All right, there you go.

07:37.856 --> 07:39.023
Very good, very good.

07:39.057 --> 07:41.525
Now why don't you just go       
  back to the bar here, Woody.

07:41.559 --> 07:44.362
Will you tell me    
            the rest of the     
            story later, Sam?

07:55.573 --> 07:57.008
Well, maybe we'll, uh...

07:57.042 --> 08:00.210
we'll meet again,           
 when your daddy isn't around.

08:00.245 --> 08:02.913
I don't need him
                to protect me.

08:02.948 --> 08:06.084
I'll meet you     
              anywhere, anytime.

08:06.118 --> 08:09.353
You can find me
                 at Cheers.

08:11.706 --> 08:13.107
I'll see you there tomorrow.

08:13.141 --> 08:14.775
I'll be there with bells on.

08:16.044 --> 08:18.613
That's just an expression.

08:25.987 --> 08:27.187
Excuse me, please.

08:27.222 --> 08:28.222
Excuse me.

08:28.256 --> 08:29.140
Yeah?

08:29.174 --> 08:30.691
Sam, I heard           
         what you've been doing.

08:30.726 --> 08:33.494
Going around      
              giving everyone   
              a hard luck story,

08:33.529 --> 08:35.062
so they give you
                big tips.

08:35.096 --> 08:36.996
I find that completely
          unprofessional,

08:37.032 --> 08:38.332
and I will not
                  condone it.

08:38.366 --> 08:40.568
I'm going to dock you   
        a day's pay.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.571
Did you hear that?

08:48.610 --> 08:50.477
Woody,

08:50.512 --> 08:51.162
cognac

08:51.196 --> 08:53.013
for all my friends.

08:53.047 --> 08:54.615
We're celebrating           
     this year's recipient

08:54.649 --> 08:55.850
of the Fisk Foundation grant.

08:55.884 --> 08:57.150
NORM:     
                      All right.

08:57.185 --> 08:58.302
I knew you could do it, buddy.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.470
What the hell is it?

09:00.389 --> 09:02.139
It's a very prestigious 
        and lucrative fellowship

09:02.173 --> 09:04.475
that will enable me, finally,  
     after all these years,

09:04.509 --> 09:05.576
to complete my treatise.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.245
"Man's need to work,            
the never-ending drive.

09:08.279 --> 09:11.716
To build, create                
and achieve."

09:11.750 --> 09:12.867
Yeah, must feel                 
pretty good.

09:12.901 --> 09:13.868
Oh, you bet.

09:13.902 --> 09:16.670
If I can cop one more fat grant,
        it's loaf city.

09:21.744 --> 09:22.710
Ah.

09:22.745 --> 09:25.379
The only thing missing now      
is a fine cigar.

09:25.413 --> 09:27.081
Well, allow me.

09:27.116 --> 09:28.850
Carla, three of your  
          finest Tampas, please.

09:28.884 --> 09:31.452
You got it, gentlemen.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.588
Look at these beauties.

09:33.622 --> 09:35.089
That'll be 45 cents.

09:37.292 --> 09:42.446
Carla, we asked for a cigar,    
not this flammable bratwurst.

09:44.332 --> 09:46.384
Come on, Fras, these
            are pretty tasty.

09:46.418 --> 09:47.968
Yeah, and they                  
outlast the others

09:48.002 --> 09:50.571
by what, a good,                
eight or nine hours.

09:50.606 --> 09:53.207
Cliffie, make a smoke 
          ring go around my head
          the way you do.

09:53.241 --> 09:54.742
Uh-huh.

10:00.082 --> 10:02.616
Okay, Boyd, I'm here.

10:02.651 --> 10:05.052
Yeah, so am I.

10:05.086 --> 10:08.055
Course, I'm always here,    
      so it's no big deal.

10:08.089 --> 10:12.192
You know, I wouldn't feel right 
     beating you senseless,

10:12.227 --> 10:14.161
unless I warn you in advance,

10:14.195 --> 10:16.731
I was on the boxing team    
         at Princeton.

10:16.765 --> 10:19.066
Yeah? Well, while you're
        beating me senseless,

10:19.100 --> 10:20.434
keep this in mind:

10:20.469 --> 10:24.772
I was first alternate   
        on the Hanover High     
        Boxing Squad.

10:24.806 --> 10:27.007
What is that supposed           
to mean?

10:27.041 --> 10:29.076
It means if anybody
             got sick or hurt,  
             I'd be the one...

10:29.110 --> 10:30.978
No!

10:32.281 --> 10:35.949
I mean, is that supposed        
to make you a tough guy?

10:35.984 --> 10:37.618
Tough enough.

10:37.653 --> 10:40.388
Yeah, well, proof           
    is in the pudding.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.939
All right, that does it.

10:41.973 --> 10:44.058
Nobody says that to me.

10:45.743 --> 10:47.712
Who wants to see a rich boy   
     get his butt whupped?

I can't leave here.

Look, if you're gonna fight,  
     go fight in the back.

10:56.204 --> 10:58.606
But remember, you gotta     
      bus your own blood.

Ugh, did I get struck

11:29.153 --> 11:31.054
No, Woody.

11:31.089 --> 11:34.441
Oh, right, I guess that only  
happens once in your life.

11:37.246 --> 11:39.447
He's okay.

11:39.481 --> 11:42.016
Gee, I hate for you guys    
      to see me like this,

11:42.050 --> 11:43.784
all dopey and muddle-headed.

11:46.755 --> 11:48.989
Yeah, we barely recognize you.

We Boyds don't appreciate having
      our faces caved in.

SAM:                            
Yeah?

11:55.263 --> 11:57.198
I'm gonna get that guy.

11:57.232 --> 11:58.432
Calm down, Woody.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.901
Isn't it enough that you left   
             little bits of face

12:00.935 --> 12:02.069
in his pinkie ring?

I'm gonna get that guy.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.580
I'm gonna get him good.

12:13.615 --> 12:14.615
Oh, come on, Woody.

12:14.649 --> 12:16.283
What do you...                  
how can you get him, man?

12:16.318 --> 12:18.986
He's rich, he's smart,     
he's in good shape, he's tough;

12:19.021 --> 12:21.222
hangs out with a better class  
          of people...

12:21.256 --> 12:22.289
Hey!                            
                        Hey!

12:22.324 --> 12:24.925
You know what          
    I'm talking about, guys.

12:24.959 --> 12:27.361
Oh, yeah, yeah. 
    Yeah.

12:27.396 --> 12:28.695
Hey!                            
                        Hey!

12:33.135 --> 12:34.568
How can I get that guy?

12:34.602 --> 12:37.104
He must have some weak spot.

12:37.139 --> 12:39.507
Oh, hi.                         
I hope I'm not too late.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.242
I heard my boyfriend            
was coming here

12:41.276 --> 12:42.443
to fight                        
that nice bartender.

12:42.477 --> 12:43.444
Fight?!

12:43.478 --> 12:44.811
I've had sneezes

12:44.846 --> 12:46.113
that lasted longer.

12:47.749 --> 12:51.285
Oh, I am so sorry               
Nash did this.

12:51.319 --> 12:53.421
He has such                     
a ridiculous temper.

12:53.455 --> 12:58.926
If there's anything I can do,  
 please, don't hesitate to ask.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.295
Are your hands just 
            naturally this soft,

13:01.329 --> 13:03.581
or you use          
            a special lotion?

13:03.615 --> 13:06.500
Lotion, but you can't           
buy it in the States.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.201
Smells good, too.

13:08.236 --> 13:09.804
No, it's fragrance free.

13:09.838 --> 13:11.338
You smell my hair.

13:11.372 --> 13:14.842
I rinse it in an essence        
of Belgian wild flowers.

13:14.876 --> 13:18.045
They make a boy's version?

13:21.716 --> 13:24.485
I'll have my personal shopper   
check and send you a case.

13:24.519 --> 13:27.387
I feel just terrible            
about what Nash did.

13:27.422 --> 13:29.790
It'd be a shame if you got      
a scar on that cute face.

13:31.109 --> 13:32.275
I'll be okay.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.344
Okay. Bye.

13:34.379 --> 13:35.045
Bye.

13:37.031 --> 13:39.883
Now, how could I get      
         that Nash guy?

13:39.918 --> 13:40.918
Woody?

13:40.952 --> 13:43.054
Woody, I think it's
                kind of obvious,

13:43.088 --> 13:44.522
if you know what I mean.

13:46.324 --> 13:48.125
Beat up his girlfriend?

13:51.996 --> 13:55.665
I don't think you could.

13:55.700 --> 13:56.851
Whoa.

13:56.885 --> 13:58.486
Come on.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.754
Now think with 
                 me here. Think.

14:00.789 --> 14:02.155
Now, have you met   
            anybody recently,

14:02.190 --> 14:03.724
kind of cute, you know?

14:03.758 --> 14:07.227
Somebody who smells good
      and has hair down to here?

14:07.261 --> 14:09.830
I'm interested in what          
you're saying, Sam,

14:09.865 --> 14:11.465
but I just had a thought.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.902
If I went out with that girl,   
I could make Nash real jealous.

14:14.936 --> 14:18.105
( <i>all chanting</i> ):           
     Woody! Woody! Woody...

14:18.140 --> 14:20.991
I'm back!           
        Woody! Woody! Woody...

14:21.025 --> 14:24.395
This has been a fabulous day.

14:24.429 --> 14:27.298
As I walked through the halls  
        of headquarters,

14:27.332 --> 14:29.032
I received nothing but kudos

14:29.067 --> 14:31.201
for my fantastic party     
        yesterday.

14:31.236 --> 14:33.437
Mr. Gaines said         
    I displayed leadership,

14:33.472 --> 14:35.873
imagination and class.

14:35.907 --> 14:38.476
I am it.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.811
That's great, Miss Howe.

14:40.845 --> 14:44.014
Listen, do you think it'd be  
  okay if I took an hour off?

14:44.048 --> 14:45.549
Of course, Woody,               
take two.

14:45.584 --> 14:46.850
You deserve it.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.085
Oh, great.

14:48.119 --> 14:50.154
I'm going to go ask your boss  
         for permission

14:50.188 --> 14:51.289
to date his daughter, okay?

14:51.323 --> 14:52.089
Okay.

14:52.857 --> 14:55.442
No!

15:04.252 --> 15:05.469
And so, Mr. Gaines,

15:05.503 --> 15:07.537
please allow me to stress again,

15:07.572 --> 15:09.506
in the strongest way possible,

15:09.540 --> 15:11.408
that my being here          
    in no way reflects

15:11.442 --> 15:13.043
upon Miss Rebecca Howe

15:13.078 --> 15:17.014
or her chance for advancement  
      in your corporation.

15:17.048 --> 15:19.917
I'll take that under advisement.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.819
Now, if you'll please get on  
      with your business?

15:21.853 --> 15:23.370
Yes, sir.

15:23.405 --> 15:25.305
My business is          
    that I'd like permission

15:25.339 --> 15:28.275
to date your daughter Kelly.

15:28.309 --> 15:29.576
I think you'll find

15:29.611 --> 15:31.929
that I'm generous, hardworking,

15:31.963 --> 15:34.531
friendly, cheerful, and honest.

15:35.283 --> 15:37.851
Oh, yeah, and I'm funny, too.

15:37.886 --> 15:40.621
Well presented, young man.

15:40.655 --> 15:43.123
And a charming, old-fashioned  
    gesture, besides.

15:43.157 --> 15:44.357
Ready to hit
              the links, Walter?

15:44.392 --> 15:46.226
In a minute, Nash.

15:46.260 --> 15:47.394
Anyway, as you can see,

15:47.428 --> 15:49.563
your visit has been
             in vain, Mr. Boyd.

15:49.598 --> 15:51.966
My daughter Kelly has been      
     dating young Nash here

15:52.000 --> 15:52.833
for some years now.

15:52.867 --> 15:53.934
Well, Boyd,

15:53.969 --> 15:55.335
how's that chin healing?

15:55.369 --> 15:58.155
Never mind my chin,       
        how's your ring?

16:03.361 --> 16:05.863
Nash, it seems Mr. Boyd here    
has his eye on Kelly.

16:05.897 --> 16:08.432
Oh, what a coincidence.

16:08.466 --> 16:11.468
Only yesterday,         
he had his eye on my Topsiders.

16:11.502 --> 16:13.103
Come on, son.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.371
We're on the tee                
in ten minutes.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.073
That sounds good,

16:16.107 --> 16:18.275
but I have to warn you,         
I've never played before.

16:21.779 --> 16:24.314
He's talking to me, Gomer.

16:26.017 --> 16:27.350
You'll show yourself out?

16:32.657 --> 16:34.392
Well, you better
                get going, Boyd.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.527
You're going to be late
                for that bus.

16:36.561 --> 16:38.629
A lot you know.

16:38.663 --> 16:42.400
It doesn't come around for      
      another 15 minutes.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.768
MR. GAINES:
                     Nash?

16:44.802 --> 16:47.104
Let's do it!

16:47.138 --> 16:49.973
I'll see you    
                later, Kelly.

16:50.007 --> 16:52.842
Got to go let your dad
          beat me at golf again.

16:56.347 --> 17:00.484
Well, I better be going, too.

17:03.405 --> 17:04.605
Wait a minute.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.057
I heard your dad's answer

17:07.090 --> 17:08.191
and I heard Nash's answer,

17:08.226 --> 17:10.527
but I still haven't heard       
        your answer yet.

17:10.561 --> 17:13.263
Oh, gosh, Woody, I couldn't.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.633
I understand.

17:19.237 --> 17:21.204
Wait a minute.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.059
Why not?

17:25.093 --> 17:26.993
I'm not Nash's property,

17:27.028 --> 17:30.197
and I just hate it when he      
always assumes that I am.

17:30.232 --> 17:33.133
Well, beans, this'll show him!

17:33.168 --> 17:36.270
Aw, that's great.           
    That is terrific.

17:36.304 --> 17:37.571
All right.

17:37.605 --> 17:39.740
I'll pick you up tomorrow       
         at 8:00, okay?

17:39.774 --> 17:42.793
Now, I promise you you're going 
to have the best time possible.

17:42.827 --> 17:44.528
You may think from looking      
             at me,

17:44.562 --> 17:47.063
that I'm an unsophisticated guy 
who doesn't know his way around,

17:47.098 --> 17:49.349
but you're going        
    to find out I do, okay?

17:49.383 --> 17:50.700
I'll see ya.

17:55.656 --> 17:57.557
Woody?

17:57.592 --> 17:59.477
Yes?

17:59.511 --> 18:02.879
Do you know you're in a closet?

18:04.549 --> 18:06.951
Yeah, but I thought it might be 
    more sophisticated

18:06.985 --> 18:08.518
just to lay low         
    and then sneak out

18:08.553 --> 18:10.421
after everyone went to bed.

18:14.475 --> 18:16.643
Good night.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.645
Good night.

18:25.086 --> 18:26.871
Sam, has Woody come back    
    from his date yet?

18:26.905 --> 18:28.071
Uh-uh.

18:28.106 --> 18:30.875
I changed his schedule around so
he can all of his evenings off

18:30.909 --> 18:33.644
so he can continue to date      
that lovely young woman.

18:33.678 --> 18:35.613
Wait a minute, now you
            want him to date?

18:35.647 --> 18:37.214
I mean, what happened      
         to the Attack

18:37.248 --> 18:39.750
of the Screaming Boss Lady      
        from Hell?

18:39.901 --> 18:42.853
Now I will admit        
     that I didn't want him

18:42.887 --> 18:45.088
to ask her out originally,      
      but let's face it--

18:45.123 --> 18:46.323
he's on a date with her.

18:46.358 --> 18:48.459
And the more they date,         
the more of a chance

18:48.493 --> 18:50.461
he has to become                
the boss's son-in-law.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.330
And boss's sons-in-law become  
              VP's

18:53.365 --> 18:55.466
and in the corporate world,   
        it always helps

18:55.500 --> 18:57.100
to have a VP          
        in your corner.

18:57.252 --> 18:58.735
That's disgusting.

18:59.770 --> 19:01.872
Sam, I don't make up the rules.

19:01.906 --> 19:03.340
I just follow them.

19:06.244 --> 19:09.713
Thanks again for a wonderful    
evening, Woody.

19:09.747 --> 19:11.815
You introduced me               
to a whole new world.

19:11.849 --> 19:13.583
Yeah, it's hard to
         believe a girl like you

19:13.618 --> 19:16.653
has never been to   
            a monster truck and 
            tractor pull before.

19:20.091 --> 19:22.393
Oh, Woody!        
              On the first date!

19:22.427 --> 19:24.361
How you going   
             to top that, buddy?

19:24.396 --> 19:26.012
Well, there's no need      
        to top it.

19:26.047 --> 19:27.714
It's a one-shot deal.

19:27.749 --> 19:28.798
Wh-What do you mean?      
            What...?

19:28.833 --> 19:30.800
I mean, the only reason     
      she went out with me

19:30.835 --> 19:32.536
was to make a point       
      with her boyfriend.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.321
Wait, wait, wait,               
how do you know that?

19:34.355 --> 19:35.322
'Cause she told me.

19:35.356 --> 19:36.556
I mean, it only seems fair.

19:36.591 --> 19:38.258
The only reason         
      I went out with her

19:38.292 --> 19:39.693
was to get revenge          
    at her boyfriend.

19:39.728 --> 19:41.394
At least that's what I told her.

19:41.429 --> 19:42.830
NORM: 
                          Woody,

19:42.864 --> 19:44.497
that is beautiful.

19:44.532 --> 19:45.565
That's the kind of honesty

19:45.599 --> 19:47.600
that's going to keep you out  
          of marriage.

19:51.589 --> 19:53.223
Kelly.

19:54.642 --> 19:56.943
Your dad said          
     I might find you here.

19:56.978 --> 19:58.728
Nash, I know what               
you're going to say,

19:58.763 --> 20:00.264
and I don't want                
to hear it.

20:00.298 --> 20:03.283
I'm tired of being
        treated like chattel.

20:03.318 --> 20:06.186
Excuse me, I think that's       
    pronounced cattle.

20:10.625 --> 20:14.895
You know, when I heard          
what you were up to,            
I got really mad.

20:14.929 --> 20:17.597
Then I, well, I realized,       
you couldn't possibly

20:17.632 --> 20:19.766
be doing this                   
for your own enjoyment,

20:19.800 --> 20:22.836
so you must be doing it         
to prove a point to me.

20:22.870 --> 20:25.239
And I have to say,              
point well taken.

20:25.273 --> 20:28.175
This has been a humbling        
experience for me.

20:28.209 --> 20:29.376
Nothing personal.

20:29.411 --> 20:33.813
That's okay, I didn't      
         understand it.

20:33.848 --> 20:38.301
Anyway, from now on,            
new Nash.

20:38.336 --> 20:41.271
Just hope you'll give me        
another chance.

20:41.305 --> 20:44.574
Well, okay.

20:44.609 --> 20:45.876
Great.

20:45.910 --> 20:46.910
Hey, let's go.

20:46.945 --> 20:49.446
Maybe we can catch              
a late supper at Guiseppi's.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.314
I don't know.

20:51.349 --> 20:53.050
Are we finished with our date, 
             Woody?

20:53.084 --> 20:57.387
Yeah, okay, I guess it's
          over... if you want.

20:59.290 --> 21:03.694
Well, thanks again          
    for a fun evening.

21:03.728 --> 21:04.894
Kelly?

21:04.929 --> 21:06.563
What?

21:06.597 --> 21:08.899
Nothing.

21:08.933 --> 21:11.768
Do you have something you want 
      to say to me, Woody?

21:11.802 --> 21:13.704
No.

21:13.738 --> 21:15.939
I had a great time.

21:15.973 --> 21:17.140
It was nice meeting you.

21:17.174 --> 21:20.377
I was really happy 
             to get to know you.

21:20.411 --> 21:23.614
I guess I did have          
    something to say to you.

21:23.648 --> 21:28.118
So, I... guess         
     we should be leaving.

21:28.153 --> 21:30.804
Yeah, I guess I should be       
     getting back to work.

21:30.838 --> 21:32.272
Well, have fun working.

21:32.307 --> 21:33.940
Yeah, have fun leaving.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.447
Woody, come on, man.

21:40.481 --> 21:41.981
Go get her.

21:42.016 --> 21:42.949
I can't, Sam.

21:42.983 --> 21:44.451
What could I possibly           
say to her?

21:44.485 --> 21:45.819
Just say, "I like you.

21:45.853 --> 21:47.387
Will you go out
                 with me again?"

21:47.422 --> 21:48.988
Oh, right, just like that.

21:49.023 --> 21:50.791
And she's going to dump         
her rich boyfriend

21:50.825 --> 21:52.692
who she's been seeing           
for all these years,

21:52.727 --> 21:53.960
for poor, old, nobody Woody.

21:53.994 --> 21:55.361
I'm afraid the real world

21:55.396 --> 21:57.564
doesn't work                    
like that, Sam; trust me.

21:57.598 --> 21:59.132
No, Woody, come on.

21:59.166 --> 22:01.234
Hey, listen, just do me
            a favor: Go get her.

22:01.268 --> 22:03.603
Now, if it doesn't work out,
            I'll buy you dinner.

22:03.638 --> 22:05.138
If it does, you owe me.

22:05.173 --> 22:06.239
Just go out there.

22:06.274 --> 22:08.808
Say, "I like you, will you
          go out with me again?"

22:08.843 --> 22:10.743
Come on, before it's    
        too late, go get her.

22:10.778 --> 22:12.212
I'll give it a try, Sam.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.668
Excuse me.

22:20.237 --> 22:21.872
Kelly, uh...

22:25.059 --> 22:27.461
I like you.

22:27.495 --> 22:29.496
Will you go out with me again?

22:29.531 --> 22:31.681
Sure.

22:31.715 --> 22:32.916
Oh, great,

22:32.950 --> 22:34.084
great.

22:34.118 --> 22:35.753
Well, we can't do it tonight.

22:35.787 --> 22:37.187
I've got to take Sam out.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.241
Oh, no, no.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.044
It's okay, we can               
go out now.

22:44.078 --> 22:46.446
Uh, yeah, I have                
a standing reservation

22:46.480 --> 22:48.381
at Pizza by the Yard.

22:48.416 --> 22:49.649
Oh, wait a minute.

22:49.684 --> 22:51.051
What about Nash?

22:51.085 --> 22:53.003
Well, I was getting in the car 
            with him

22:53.037 --> 22:54.304
when I realized...

22:54.338 --> 22:56.807
Woody, I have          
    a lot more fun with you.

22:56.841 --> 23:00.343
Ah, yeah,                       
I know what you mean.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.713
I didn't have much fun          
with Nash, either.

23:04.248 --> 23:05.582
Hey, Miss Howe?

23:06.751 --> 23:09.002
Can I leave now?        
        Take Kelly out?

23:09.036 --> 23:11.205
I promise I'll work       
      a double next week.

23:11.239 --> 23:12.272
Oh, don't worry about it.

23:12.307 --> 23:13.707
Go, go ahead.          
    Have a good time.

23:13.741 --> 23:15.875
And if you want to stay out   
  real late and get married,

23:15.910 --> 23:17.477
then come in anytime tomorrow.

23:17.512 --> 23:19.362
You're the greatest, Miss Howe.

23:19.396 --> 23:20.564
WOODY:                          
Okay, let's hurry.

23:20.598 --> 23:21.998
If we get there by 6:00,

23:22.032 --> 23:24.234
we can sit              
     at the Pac-Man table.

23:24.268 --> 23:25.802
What's a Pac-Man?

23:25.836 --> 23:28.371
Oh, Kelly, I have  
        so much to teach you.
