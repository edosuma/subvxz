- you're sorry.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.167

- And yet,
- you're still here.

07:20.626 --> 07:21.689

- Don't care.

No, they don't!

re-elected president

08:00.751 --> 08:03.667
of the reptile club!

08:03.709 --> 08:05.480
I beat out a

08:05.481 --> 08:07.250
picture of Godzilla.

08:07.292 --> 08:08.292
That's nice.

08:08.293 --> 08:09.292
Just be sure to

08:07.292 --> 08:09.292
wear clean underwear.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.459
The problem is,

08:12.460 --> 08:13.834
I've been too

08:11.083 --> 08:13.834
easy on Emma.

08:13.876 --> 08:15.292
- I need to be more
- like my dad.

08:15.334 --> 08:17.059
- Are you going - to make her wear
- A fifty pound pack

08:17.083 --> 08:18.522
And swim the

08:18.523 --> 08:19.959
Rio Grande?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.417
No. Her scrawny arms

08:21.418 --> 08:22.834
could never handle

08:20.000 --> 08:22.834
that current.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.376
Well, I see one must

08:26.377 --> 08:27.667
be a problem child

08:27.709 --> 08:29.334
- to get noticed
- around here.

08:30.417 --> 08:31.834
- (GASPS)
- Ravi?

08:31.876 --> 08:33.517
- How long have you
- been standing there?

08:36.375 --> 08:38.083
So... Exactly

08:38.085 --> 08:39.792
how is picking up

08:36.375 --> 08:39.792
your video games

08:39.833 --> 08:41.272
going to help me

08:41.273 --> 08:42.708
with my karate skills?

08:42.751 --> 08:44.335
You dare question

08:44.336 --> 08:45.918
your sensei?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.918
This simple task

08:47.919 --> 08:49.876
will help you find

08:45.959 --> 08:49.876
focus of mind.

08:49.918 --> 08:51.292
I have also found

08:51.334 --> 08:52.334
a DVD marked

08:52.335 --> 08:53.335
"Jessie at the beach."

08:56.083 --> 08:57.355
I don't know what

08:57.356 --> 08:58.626
you're talking about!

08:58.667 --> 09:00.059
- I would never
- make a secret video

09:00.083 --> 09:01.147
Of Jessie frolicking

09:01.148 --> 09:02.209
on the sand.

09:04.542 --> 09:05.834
Oh!

09:05.876 --> 09:07.834
- So that's why
- you asked her

09:07.876 --> 09:09.334
To run in slow motion.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.417
Moving on.

09:14.459 --> 09:15.668
It is now time to

09:15.669 --> 09:16.876
break this board.

09:17.751 --> 09:18.959
I can't.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.022
I'm afraid I'm going

09:20.023 --> 09:21.042
to hurt my hand.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.188
Which is weird,

09:23.189 --> 09:25.292
since breaking

09:21.083 --> 09:25.292
stuff is my jam.

09:25.334 --> 09:27.105
Visualize

09:27.106 --> 09:28.876
your hand going

09:25.334 --> 09:28.876
through the board.

09:28.918 --> 09:30.417
- I promise, you
- will not get hurt.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.667
Hee...

09:34.709 --> 09:35.709
Ow!

09:37.918 --> 09:39.584
You promised!

09:39.626 --> 09:41.293
Hey, I also promised

09:41.294 --> 09:42.959
Jessie I wasn't filming

09:39.626 --> 09:42.959
her at the beach.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Speaking of that,

09:44.001 --> 09:45.001
I've got a DVD to watch.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.792
- I'm worried
- about Emma.

09:50.834 --> 09:52.751
- She's been locked - in her bedroom
- All day.

09:52.792 --> 09:53.814
On the bright side,

09:53.815 --> 09:54.834
she's been in her

09:52.792 --> 09:54.834
bedroom all day.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.042
- No! I don't have
- any homework.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.083
I'm suspended!

10:00.626 --> 10:01.667
I'm going out.

10:01.709 --> 10:03.375
- Yeah, out of
- your mind!

10:03.417 --> 10:05.658
- Please tell me you - fell asleep in some
- Grape juice?

10:07.042 --> 10:08.209
Starting to miss

10:08.210 --> 10:09.375
the whole "locked in

10:07.042 --> 10:09.375
the bedroom" thing?

10:10.751 --> 10:11.709
(EXCLAIMING)

10:11.751 --> 10:13.500
Is that a tattoo?

10:13.542 --> 10:14.751
(GASPING)

10:14.752 --> 10:15.959
Oh, come off,

10:13.542 --> 10:15.959
come off, come off!

10:16.000 --> 10:17.771
Hey! The only thing

10:17.772 --> 10:19.542
coming off is my skin!

10:19.584 --> 10:20.894
- What am I gonna
- tell your parents?

10:20.918 --> 10:22.792
- Oh! Oh!
- I got it!

10:22.834 --> 10:24.075
- We'll just
- cut off your arm.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.518
- Good idea. - Because that's
- Easier to explain

10:27.542 --> 10:28.667
Than a tattoo.

10:29.667 --> 10:30.834
Jessie, relax!

10:30.876 --> 10:32.751
- It's just marker.
- (SIGHING)

10:32.792 --> 10:34.433
- To show the tattoo
- artist what I want.

10:35.667 --> 10:36.709
Hold it!

10:36.751 --> 10:38.375
- You are not
- going anywhere.

10:38.417 --> 10:39.834
- Getting suspended
- from school

10:39.876 --> 10:41.500
- Also means
- getting grounded.

10:41.542 --> 10:42.685
- It's kind of
- a twofer thing.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.792
You can't do that!

10:43.834 --> 10:45.626
Yes, I can!

10:45.667 --> 10:47.059
- And just be glad - I have such respect
- For our troops,

10:47.083 --> 10:48.852
- Or else you'd be - on your way to
- Military school.

10:48.876 --> 10:50.460
(GASPING) You want

10:50.461 --> 10:52.042
me to wear camo

10:48.876 --> 10:52.042
and get a buzzcut?

10:52.083 --> 10:53.792
- What's next,
- sensible shoes?

10:57.667 --> 10:58.709
Wait for it.

10:58.751 --> 10:59.876
(DOOR SLAMMING)

11:04.083 --> 11:05.251
Maybe we should

11:05.252 --> 11:06.417
take everything

11:04.083 --> 11:06.417
off the walls

11:06.459 --> 11:08.417
- until Emma goes
- off to college.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.042
- Or, let's be real,
- marries a prince.

11:13.709 --> 11:15.063
Attention!

11:15.064 --> 11:16.417
Bad boy alert!

11:16.459 --> 11:18.001
Not only am I 15 minutes

11:18.002 --> 11:19.542
late coming home,

11:19.584 --> 11:21.314
but at lunch, I put

11:21.315 --> 11:23.042
an unhealthy topping

11:19.584 --> 11:23.042
on my yogurt.

11:23.083 --> 11:26.167
Full-fat granola!

11:26.209 --> 11:27.626
(WHISTLES)

11:27.627 --> 11:29.042
You are quite the rebel.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.876
- Hide your daughters,
- people!

11:32.584 --> 11:33.772
This is terrible,

11:33.773 --> 11:34.959
she's out of control!

11:35.167 --> 11:37.417
I am a boy!

11:40.083 --> 11:41.834
- Oh, she was - talking about Emma.
- Yeah.

11:44.167 --> 11:46.042
- Do you think I was
- too hard on Emma?

11:46.083 --> 11:47.834
- Or do you think
- I wasn't hard enough?

11:47.876 --> 11:49.709
- I just want to do
- what's best for her.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.709
Well, Bertram?

11:52.792 --> 11:54.042
What do you think?

11:54.083 --> 11:56.042
- I think, when you came
- out here and said

11:56.083 --> 11:57.938
"Bertram, can I talk to you?"

11:57.939 --> 11:59.792
I should have hurled myself

11:56.083 --> 11:59.792
off the terrace.

11:59.834 --> 12:00.959
When was the last time

12:00.960 --> 12:02.083
you hurled anything?

12:02.125 --> 12:03.751
Last time you cooked.

12:05.626 --> 12:06.626
Jessie, I found

12:06.627 --> 12:07.627
this note from Emma.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.584
- And, in case you
- have not noticed,

12:09.626 --> 12:10.668
I dyed my hair from

12:10.669 --> 12:11.709
chestnut brown

12:11.751 --> 12:12.814
to acorn brown.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.876
Lock me up!

12:15.876 --> 12:17.042
Oh, no!

12:17.083 --> 12:18.584
Emma's run away!

12:18.626 --> 12:19.751
Are you sure?

12:19.752 --> 12:20.876
Maybe it says,

12:18.626 --> 12:20.876
"Run to play."

12:20.918 --> 12:21.980
She's not

12:21.981 --> 12:23.042
a very good

12:20.918 --> 12:23.042
speller.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.563
No, it's right here

12:24.564 --> 12:26.042
in black and glitter!

12:26.083 --> 12:27.459
We have to go find her.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.334
BTW, I got my

12:32.335 --> 12:33.834
belly button

12:30.834 --> 12:33.834
pierced!

12:33.876 --> 12:34.938
Well, it is only

12:34.939 --> 12:36.000
a clip-on,

12:36.042 --> 12:37.918
but it is still infected!

12:42.083 --> 12:44.542
Wax on, wax off.

12:44.584 --> 12:46.500
- Wax on...
- Back off!

12:48.000 --> 12:49.105
I'm fed up doing

12:49.106 --> 12:50.209
all of your chores.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.959
- Who do I look
- like, Ravi?

12:53.709 --> 12:55.188
Meanwhile,

12:55.189 --> 12:56.667
I have my belt

12:53.709 --> 12:56.667
test in two hours,

12:56.709 --> 12:57.876
and so far all

12:57.877 --> 12:59.042
I've learned is

12:56.709 --> 12:59.042
that you're lazy.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.709
Oh, yeah?

13:00.751 --> 13:01.834
Well...

13:01.876 --> 13:03.077
- Prepare to
- defend yourself.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.042
Bring it on.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.792
- I've been looking
- forward to this

13:07.834 --> 13:08.897
Since you made me

13:08.898 --> 13:09.959
clean your toilet!

13:11.083 --> 13:13.042
BTW, see a doctor!

13:13.083 --> 13:14.542
(SCOFFS)

13:15.125 --> 13:16.876
(GRUNTS)

13:18.125 --> 13:19.792
- Wax on!
- Hee-yah!

13:19.834 --> 13:20.834
- Wax off!
- Hee-yah!

13:22.834 --> 13:23.876
See?

13:23.918 --> 13:25.751
Oh, I get it.

13:25.792 --> 13:26.814
So all those chores

13:26.815 --> 13:27.834
you made me do

13:27.876 --> 13:29.059
- were to help me
- with my karate.

13:29.083 --> 13:30.918
Exactly!

13:30.959 --> 13:32.209
- And next,
- you will learn how

13:32.250 --> 13:33.501
Cleaning my dirty socks

13:33.502 --> 13:34.751
will help you with your...

13:34.792 --> 13:35.834
(INHALES DEEPLY)

13:35.876 --> 13:37.083
Breath control.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.792
Again, see a doctor.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.001
Okay, I've gone to

13:46.002 --> 13:47.042
every shoe store on

13:44.959 --> 13:47.042
the Upper West Side

13:47.083 --> 13:49.000
and no sign of Emma.

13:49.042 --> 13:50.768
- Well, I've been sitting - right here
and she hasn't - Come through the lobby.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.064
You've just been sitting

13:52.065 --> 13:53.334
in that chair for two hours?

13:53.375 --> 13:54.876
Of course not.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.709
- For an hour,
- I sat in that chair.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.542
Well, obviously I

13:59.543 --> 14:01.000
don't have to worry

13:58.083 --> 14:01.000
about you running away.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.146
I only run if

14:03.147 --> 14:04.250
something's chasing me.

14:04.292 --> 14:05.876
(PHONE RINGING)

14:05.918 --> 14:07.000
Oh! Maybe that's Emma!

14:08.751 --> 14:09.918
Oh, no, it's Christina.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.393
- I can't talk to her
- while Emma's missing!

14:11.417 --> 14:12.977
- Don't worry.
- I'll take care of this.

14:13.876 --> 14:15.083
Hi, Christina!

14:15.125 --> 14:16.626
Yeah, she's right here.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.042
- I am going to
- wring your ne...

14:20.083 --> 14:21.626
- Nice to hear from
- you, Christina!

14:22.417 --> 14:23.918
Well...

14:23.959 --> 14:25.000
Well, what's up?

14:26.792 --> 14:27.918
Why is Emma making

14:27.919 --> 14:29.042
so many charges

14:29.083 --> 14:30.918
- at the New York
- Tipton Hotel?

14:30.959 --> 14:32.335
Uh, because

14:32.336 --> 14:33.709
we are having

14:30.959 --> 14:33.709
a girls' day!

14:33.751 --> 14:34.897
Yeah, in fact

14:34.898 --> 14:36.042
we're in the

14:33.751 --> 14:36.042
spa right now.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.418
So, Sven, what kind of

14:37.419 --> 14:38.751
massages do you offer?

14:38.792 --> 14:40.083
- No!
- Yes!

14:40.125 --> 14:41.751
- (STOMPING)
- (GROANING)

14:41.792 --> 14:42.980
(IN SWEDISH ACCENT)

14:42.981 --> 14:44.167
Yeah, would you like

14:41.792 --> 14:44.167
the Swedish massage,

14:44.209 --> 14:46.000
or the deep tissue?

14:47.792 --> 14:49.251
Okay, Christina,

14:49.252 --> 14:50.709
we will.

14:50.751 --> 14:52.043
Yes, I know I'm

14:52.044 --> 14:53.334
responsible for

14:50.751 --> 14:53.334
my own tips.

14:56.167 --> 14:57.959
- Okay, Zuri,
- you got this.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.250
- Yup, I'm not
- nervous at all.

14:59.292 --> 15:00.810
- If I were nervous,
- I'd be talking fast.

15:00.834 --> 15:01.792
- Which I only do
- when I'm nervous.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.667
- Dang, I'm talking
- fast, aren't I?

15:04.083 --> 15:05.167
Yeah!

15:05.209 --> 15:07.000
- And you were kind of
- spitting a little.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.918
- Now! Go out there
- and break that board!

15:14.125 --> 15:15.417
Hello, Luke.

15:15.459 --> 15:17.083
- Ravi. What are
- you doing here?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.439
Well, to demonstrate

15:19.440 --> 15:21.751
my new rebellious

15:17.125 --> 15:21.751
behavior, I ran away.

15:21.792 --> 15:22.792
Unfortunately,

15:22.793 --> 15:23.793
no one noticed.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.688
So, I decided to

15:26.689 --> 15:28.292
come here and support

15:25.083 --> 15:28.292
my dear sister.

15:28.334 --> 15:29.334
Hmm.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.021
Come on, Zuri.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.083
You can do this.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.959
I can do this.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.083
One.

15:44.876 --> 15:45.876
Two.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.709
Aw, her little

15:54.710 --> 15:56.042
hand was shaking.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.918
Just like me when

15:57.919 --> 15:59.751
I hear the words

15:56.083 --> 15:59.751
"Time to pick teams."

16:01.083 --> 16:02.476
- We should have spent - more time with the
- Wood board

16:02.500 --> 16:04.375
Instead of my surfboard.

16:04.417 --> 16:05.959
- I feel like such
- a big jerk.

16:08.375 --> 16:09.375
- LUKE:
- Wait.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.375
- That gives
- me an idea!

16:15.334 --> 16:16.500
I'm such a loser.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.792
- (SCOFFS)
- Yeah.

16:17.834 --> 16:18.918
I knew you'd never be

16:18.919 --> 16:20.000
able to break that board.

16:20.042 --> 16:21.500
You did?

16:21.542 --> 16:22.793
Yeah, you just don't

16:22.794 --> 16:24.042
have what it takes

16:21.542 --> 16:24.042
to get a yellow belt.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.459
Oh, hey!

16:25.500 --> 16:26.522
Maybe they'll give

16:26.523 --> 16:27.542
you a feather belt?

16:27.584 --> 16:28.834
What's that?

16:28.876 --> 16:30.250
- It's just like
- a yellow belt.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.959
But for chickens.

16:35.042 --> 16:37.000
Who you calling chicken?

16:37.042 --> 16:38.105
Well, if the

16:38.106 --> 16:39.167
feather fits...

16:40.959 --> 16:45.000
(CLUCKING)

16:48.292 --> 16:49.834
I'll show you

16:49.835 --> 16:51.375
who can't break

16:48.292 --> 16:51.375
a stupid board!

16:59.918 --> 17:03.167
(CLUCKING)

17:03.209 --> 17:05.000
Hee-yah!

17:10.000 --> 17:11.584
Hee-yah!

17:11.626 --> 17:13.083
- Hee-yah!
- Hee-yah!

(YELPING)

17:27.416 --> 17:29.125
Who's the chicken now?

17:29.167 --> 17:31.000
- (CHUCKLING) - I knew you
- Could do it!

17:31.667 --> 17:33.167
You did?

17:33.209 --> 17:35.042
- But you called
- me a chicken.

17:35.083 --> 17:37.042
A good sensei knows

17:37.043 --> 17:39.000
how to motivate his

17:35.083 --> 17:39.000
student.

17:39.042 --> 17:40.292
I just needed to get you

17:40.293 --> 17:41.542
angry enough to forget

17:39.042 --> 17:41.542
how scared you were.

17:42.417 --> 17:43.918
Thank you, sensei.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.001
It has been an honor

17:45.002 --> 17:46.042
to learn from you.

17:48.959 --> 17:50.125
Congratulations, Zuri.

17:50.167 --> 17:52.042
- I would like to
- give you a high-five,

17:52.083 --> 17:53.688
But I am afraid

17:53.689 --> 17:55.292
you will chop my

17:52.083 --> 17:55.292
hand clean off.

17:55.334 --> 17:56.667
And it is

17:56.668 --> 17:58.000
difficult to play

17:55.334 --> 17:58.000
chess with a hook.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.647
Emma?

18:03.648 --> 18:05.042
You open this door

18:02.250 --> 18:05.042
right now, young lady!

18:05.083 --> 18:07.042
- Make me,
- old lady!

18:07.083 --> 18:08.584
Hey!

18:08.626 --> 18:09.918
I put that seat

18:09.919 --> 18:11.209
in my shower because

18:08.626 --> 18:11.209
it is comfortable!

18:13.083 --> 18:15.000
- So help me,
- Emma Evangeline Ross,

18:15.042 --> 18:16.626
I will break down this door!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Please be a soft wood.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.000
(GRUNTING)

18:24.667 --> 18:25.584
Madam,

18:25.626 --> 18:27.459
- there are less
- drastic ways

18:27.500 --> 18:29.185
- To deal with - a de-magnetized
- Key card.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.042
No, you don't understand.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.126
I'm a nanny and one

18:32.127 --> 18:33.167
of my kids has locked

18:31.083 --> 18:33.167
herself in that room.

18:33.209 --> 18:34.251
Well, I am the manager

18:34.252 --> 18:35.292
of this hotel,

18:35.334 --> 18:36.792
and we have a policy,

18:36.793 --> 18:38.250
"You break it, you buy it."

18:38.292 --> 18:39.626
You owe me a new rib.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.459
Oh!

18:41.500 --> 18:43.059
- Wait! I mean...
- Do you have any idea

18:43.083 --> 18:45.000
- How annoying
- kids can be?

18:45.584 --> 18:46.584
Oh.

18:48.584 --> 18:50.459
Do I!

18:50.500 --> 18:52.334
- I worked with them
- for six years.

18:52.375 --> 18:53.685
- Three of them aboard
- a cruise ship.

18:53.709 --> 18:55.083
Or as I like to call it...

18:55.125 --> 18:56.584
a floating reformatory

18:56.585 --> 18:58.042
with shuffleboard.

18:58.083 --> 19:00.042
- Once, I rode the
- Staten Island ferry.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.444
- Yeah, I puked right - in front of the
- Statue of Liberty.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.042
- So you were both green.
- (LAUGHING)

19:05.083 --> 19:07.042
- You must text me
- that picture.

19:07.626 --> 19:09.292
Wait.

19:09.334 --> 19:10.355
Do you have any

19:10.356 --> 19:11.375
advice for me?

19:11.417 --> 19:12.522
Yes. No running

19:12.523 --> 19:13.626
in my hallway!

19:20.375 --> 19:21.918
Okay.

19:21.959 --> 19:23.751
If there's one thing

19:23.752 --> 19:25.542
I learned from my

19:21.959 --> 19:25.542
"Voyage of the Doomed,"

19:25.584 --> 19:26.668
it's that,

19:26.669 --> 19:27.751
with teenagers,

19:27.792 --> 19:29.001
sometimes, just being

19:29.002 --> 19:30.209
willing to listen

19:30.250 --> 19:32.042
is the best thing.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.542
- And if that
- doesn't work,

19:34.459 --> 19:36.000
I have a pass key.

19:37.584 --> 19:39.292
Thank you, Mr...

19:39.334 --> 19:40.334
Moseby?

19:41.375 --> 19:43.000
You are very welcome.

19:51.626 --> 19:52.626
Emma?

19:53.584 --> 19:55.084
JESSIE:

19:55.085 --> 19:56.584
Look, I'm really sorry.

19:56.626 --> 19:58.226
- Instead of just
- losing my temper, I...

19:58.250 --> 19:59.647
Should have just

19:59.648 --> 20:01.042
asked you what's

19:58.250 --> 20:01.042
going on.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.563
I mean, I wish my dad

20:02.564 --> 20:04.042
had listened to me before

20:04.083 --> 20:05.563
taking away my

20:05.564 --> 20:07.042
tank privileges.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.563
Did he really make you

20:08.564 --> 20:10.042
swim the Rio Grande with

20:07.083 --> 20:10.042
a fifty-pound pack?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.709
- Yup. I still have
- dual citizenship.

20:13.626 --> 20:15.250
Anyway...

20:15.292 --> 20:16.396
From now on,

20:16.397 --> 20:17.500
I promise I won't

20:15.292 --> 20:17.500
yell, or...

20:17.542 --> 20:18.793
Judge, or...

20:18.794 --> 20:20.042
You don't even

20:17.542 --> 20:20.042
have to come out.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.042
But...

20:21.083 --> 20:23.167
If you're ready to talk,

20:24.709 --> 20:26.042
I'm ready to listen.

20:28.209 --> 20:29.209
Really?

20:29.709 --> 20:31.083
Really.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.834
Tell me what's going on.

20:32.876 --> 20:34.000
I can't.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.751
- It's not that
- I don't want to,

20:36.792 --> 20:38.126
I just don't know

20:38.127 --> 20:39.459
what's going on.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.042
One minute I feel normal,

20:41.083 --> 20:42.250
the next minute I'm angry

20:42.292 --> 20:43.542
and I just want to smash

20:43.543 --> 20:44.792
everything in my room.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.334
- Except my shoes.
- Duh.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.667
Welcome to being a teenager.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.417
You just don't understand.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.709
Of course I do.

20:53.751 --> 20:54.897
You know,

20:54.898 --> 20:56.042
I was 15 once, too.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.417
Yeah, like, forever ago.

20:58.584 --> 20:59.852
- Yeah, back in
- the olden days,

20:59.876 --> 21:01.709
- When we had to flip
- our cell phones open.

21:03.751 --> 21:05.042
Does it ever get better?

21:05.083 --> 21:06.876
Absolutely.

21:06.918 --> 21:09.876
And, meanwhile, I think

21:09.918 --> 21:11.480
if we're patient

21:11.481 --> 21:13.042
and really listen

21:09.918 --> 21:13.042
to each other,

21:13.918 --> 21:15.751
- we can get through
- this together.

21:16.459 --> 21:17.459
Deal?

21:18.626 --> 21:19.626
Deal.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.667
Wow, nice room!

21:28.834 --> 21:30.417
I'm sorry, Jessie.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.250
Let's go home.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.834
Not so fast.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.043
Your mom thinks

21:36.044 --> 21:37.209
we're having a fun

21:34.876 --> 21:37.209
girls' day, so...

21:37.250 --> 21:38.375
Why don't we order

21:38.376 --> 21:39.500
room service

21:37.250 --> 21:39.500
and get massages?

21:39.542 --> 21:41.209
- Great!
- (LAUGHS)

21:41.250 --> 21:42.709
- Do you have any
- cash for the tip?

21:45.083 --> 21:46.397
No, no, no,

21:46.398 --> 21:47.709
I am telling you,

21:45.083 --> 21:47.709
Cody, it's uncanny!

21:47.751 --> 21:49.668
She looks exactly

21:49.669 --> 21:51.584
like Bailey.

21:51.626 --> 21:53.542
- You want to come see
- for yourself?

21:54.500 --> 21:55.500
Oh, dear!

22:10.792 --> 22:12.209
Yo, Jessie!

22:12.959 --> 22:14.459
Check out my hog!

22:16.834 --> 22:17.876
Ravi?

22:17.918 --> 22:19.292
What's going on?

22:19.334 --> 22:20.975
- And I'm assuming
- that's vegan leather.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.272
Of course.

22:23.273 --> 22:24.292
I am a bad boy,

22:24.334 --> 22:25.876
not an eco-criminal.

22:27.834 --> 22:29.310
- I am just trying to
- get your attention

22:29.334 --> 22:31.000
- So you will
- read my paper.

22:31.042 --> 22:32.459
Oh, I read it!

22:32.460 --> 22:33.876
It was great!

22:33.918 --> 22:35.292
I am so proud of you.

22:35.334 --> 22:36.667
Thank you!

22:36.709 --> 22:38.626
- I just wish you had
- told me that before

22:38.667 --> 22:40.147
I joined that gang

22:40.148 --> 22:41.626
of motorcycle ruffians.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.021
Apparently, they are

22:43.022 --> 22:44.375
going to "initiate me."

22:45.834 --> 22:47.272
I am hoping it is just a

22:47.273 --> 22:48.709
very elaborate handshake.

22:49.751 --> 22:51.626
Aw, you made friends!

22:53.667 --> 22:55.126
Ravi, there's a

22:55.127 --> 22:56.584
gentleman named...

22:56.626 --> 22:58.251
Pickaxe waiting

22:58.252 --> 22:59.876
for you downstairs?

22:59.918 --> 23:01.397
Jessie, I know

23:01.398 --> 23:02.876
I rocked that paper,

23:02.918 --> 23:04.584
- but can you
- please ground me

23:04.626 --> 23:06.083
- So I do not
- have to go all

23:06.125 --> 23:07.313
Sons of Anarchy

23:07.314 --> 23:08.500
with Pickaxe

23:06.125 --> 23:08.500
and his pals?

23:09.751 --> 23:11.250
- All right,
- you're grounded.

23:11.292 --> 23:12.584
- (EXCLAIMS)
- Thank you, Jessie!

23:17.417 --> 23:19.017
- Okay, his teenage years
- I can handle.
