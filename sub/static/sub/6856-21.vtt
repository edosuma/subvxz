00:16.854 --> 00:18.618
<i>Republic victory is at hand.</i>

00:19.065 --> 00:21.366
<i>Clone troopers,
under the command of the Jedi,</i>

00:21.491 --> 00:24.624
<i>have successfully invaded
the Separatist-occupied world of Ryloth.</i>

00:25.311 --> 00:28.304
<i>Anakin Skywalker
battles the enemies in the skies,</i>

00:28.429 --> 00:31.008
<i>while Obi-Wan Kenobi frees villages</i>

00:31.133 --> 00:34.233
<i>from the grip of vile Separatist leader
Wat Tambor.</i>

00:35.020 --> 00:38.745
<i>Now Jedi General Mace Windu
leads the attack on enemy lines</i>

00:38.870 --> 00:42.442
<i>in the final offensive to liberate
the capital city of Lessu.</i>

01:02.172 --> 01:03.222
Take cover.

01:07.833 --> 01:11.033
- We have stopped the enemy advance.
- Give me those.

01:12.609 --> 01:13.499
Good.

01:13.624 --> 01:16.342
Now order our cannon
to target their rear units.

01:16.861 --> 01:19.561
We'll box them in
and blast them to pieces.

01:26.106 --> 01:27.144
We're pinned down!

01:27.312 --> 01:29.313
Commander,
bring out the lightning squad.

01:30.021 --> 01:31.649
I want lightning up here now!

01:43.772 --> 01:46.622
Get the injured back.
I'm gonna clear the road.

02:00.460 --> 02:03.510
- Sir, the enemy is advancing again.
- Let me see.

02:04.473 --> 02:06.723
Find some cover. Move it! Let's go!

02:10.710 --> 02:12.410
He's all yours, General.

02:13.398 --> 02:15.398
We'll lead the way, Commander.

02:17.897 --> 02:18.863
Forward!

02:23.980 --> 02:26.280
Now that Jedi is leading the attack.

02:26.997 --> 02:29.081
Concentrate all your fire
on those walkers!

02:38.317 --> 02:39.517
Should we run?

02:42.516 --> 02:45.166
It would be better
if we just surrendered.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.150
How many men did we lose?

03:04.606 --> 03:07.370
32 I think, including command crews
of 3 walkers.

03:08.516 --> 03:11.025
The good news is
General Kenobi's broken their lines.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.829
We have a clear path
straight to the capital now.

03:14.844 --> 03:16.494
<i>This battle was costly.</i>

03:18.367 --> 03:20.341
<i>We're gonna need help
to take the city.</i>

03:20.823 --> 03:23.848
The Republic is advancing faster
than I expected.

03:24.429 --> 03:26.881
I calculate they will reach
the main gates by morning.

03:27.006 --> 03:30.546
- I recommend we prepare our retreat.
- I will not retreat.

03:31.134 --> 03:34.340
That Jedi does not have the troops
to take this city.

03:34.635 --> 03:38.150
Bring our units inside the walls
and secure the bridge.

03:42.349 --> 03:44.073
<i>What's your progress, Skywalker?</i>

03:44.741 --> 03:47.583
<i>My fighters have secured control
of the space around Ryloth.</i>

03:47.708 --> 03:49.773
<i>We have the Separatist cruisers
on the run.</i>

03:49.898 --> 03:51.848
<i>Very good, General Skywalker.</i>

03:52.204 --> 03:54.624
Master Kenobi has taken
the Jixuan desert,

03:54.793 --> 03:56.836
so the southern hemisphere is ours.

03:57.373 --> 03:59.646
<i>Then it's almost over.</i>

03:59.889 --> 04:02.758
Not yet. The key position
is the capital of Lessu.

04:03.089 --> 04:05.486
Our spies are certain
the Separatist leader Wat Tambor

04:05.611 --> 04:09.221
<i>- has his command center there.
- When taken the city we have,</i>

04:09.346 --> 04:12.840
<i>- capture Tambor we must.
- It's not going to be easy, Master.</i>

04:12.965 --> 04:15.415
Tambor
has chosen his stronghold well.

04:15.647 --> 04:18.357
This plasma bridge
is the only way in or out.

04:18.903 --> 04:22.203
<i>I'm afraid a siege
could drag on indefinitely.</i>

04:22.466 --> 04:24.572
<i>My people have suffered so much
already.</i>

04:24.924 --> 04:27.924
<i>A plan you have to take the bridge,
Master Windu?</i>

04:28.376 --> 04:30.356
With our forces stretched so thinly,

04:30.481 --> 04:34.438
I'm gonna enlist the help of the freedom
fighters led by Cham Syndulla.

04:34.695 --> 04:37.960
His fight against the droids {\has }made him
a symbol of freedom for the people.

04:38.154 --> 04:39.503
<i>Cham Syndulla</i>

04:39.975 --> 04:42.097
<i>was a radical before the war.</i>

04:42.758 --> 04:44.508
<i>He is very unpredictable.</i>

04:44.718 --> 04:46.218
<i>He can't be trusted.</i>

04:46.798 --> 04:49.098
<i>I know Syndulla seeks to gain power.</i>

04:49.681 --> 04:51.057
<i>We were political rivals.</i>

04:51.226 --> 04:53.611
I'll leave the politics to you,
Senator.

04:53.736 --> 04:56.145
I'm gonna do whatever I can
to help these people.

04:56.313 --> 04:59.231
<i>Perhaps we could send you
Republic reinforcements instead.</i>

05:00.467 --> 05:03.773
<i>There are no reinforcements available,
Chancellor.</i>

05:04.217 --> 05:06.530
We can't win without Syndulla's help.

05:15.157 --> 05:18.057
What makes you think
the rebels are this way, General?

05:20.219 --> 05:21.253
What is it, sir?

05:22.154 --> 05:25.295
The resistance fighters
ride creatures native to this region.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.926
And these tracks are fresh.

05:30.925 --> 05:32.765
Which means they can't be that far.

05:35.514 --> 05:37.561
Isn't this the spot
where they were massacred?

05:37.893 --> 05:39.855
Looks like
it was a quite of a fight.

05:40.856 --> 05:43.156
Wonder who put up these gravestones.

05:44.049 --> 05:45.199
Is that them?

06:00.161 --> 06:02.711
<i>Your tactical droid has informed me</i>

06:02.880 --> 06:06.868
<i>of the pitiful job you have done
protecting our investment on Ryloth.</i>

06:08.219 --> 06:09.869
That droid exaggerates.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.144
I have not lost yet.

06:12.556 --> 06:14.987
<i>You're no match for Master Windu.</i>

06:15.528 --> 06:17.793
<i>Do not become greedy, Emir Tambor.</i>

06:18.464 --> 06:21.814
<i>Take what valuables you can
and destroy everything else.</i>

06:22.232 --> 06:23.282
Everything?

06:23.692 --> 06:26.761
<i>We can put this defeat
to political use.</i>

06:27.255 --> 06:30.938
<i>The charred ruins of Ryloth
will demonstrate to the galaxy</i>

06:31.265 --> 06:34.410
<i>the cost of a Republic victory.</i>

06:34.953 --> 06:36.053
As you wish.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.939
Keep on the lookout
for that lost patrol.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.480
Did you hear that?

07:01.118 --> 07:02.664
I don't see anything.

07:08.618 --> 07:11.868
- Why didn't we take them out, sir?
- I have a feeling

07:12.221 --> 07:14.008
the rebels will do it for us.

07:16.137 --> 07:18.437
- Look out! It's an ambush!
- Help!

07:18.637 --> 07:20.137
It's the resistance!

07:41.386 --> 07:44.413
I was wondering when you'd find me,
Master Jedi.

07:44.724 --> 07:46.074
General Syndulla,

07:46.968 --> 07:50.718
- I've come for your help.
- What makes you think you'll get it?

07:57.788 --> 08:01.136
Emir Tambor, our bombers
are nearly ready for launch.

08:06.479 --> 08:09.436
And now I will ready your ship
for evacuation.

08:10.418 --> 08:12.435
I am not yet ready to leave.

08:13.161 --> 08:16.775
In any case, we have a schedule to keep.
The ship will be ready.

08:35.344 --> 08:38.394
- Some hideout you have here.
- It has advantages.

08:43.163 --> 08:44.867
We saw the graves

08:45.127 --> 08:48.177
of many of your people
in that battlefield as well.

08:48.302 --> 08:51.292
Together, we can prevent that
from happening again.

08:51.417 --> 08:54.095
Do you know why we were massacred,
Master Jedi?

08:54.220 --> 08:56.108
When the droids swept over Ryloth,

08:56.233 --> 08:58.483
the Republic was unable to help us.

08:58.608 --> 09:01.858
We were forced to surrender,
and we came here unarmed.

09:02.432 --> 09:05.382
The Separatists brought tanks
to exterminate us.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.696
Come here, boy.

09:07.913 --> 09:09.162
Come on. Don't be afraid.

09:09.744 --> 09:11.665
See, there's nothing
to be afraid of here.

09:16.247 --> 09:18.171
He says his blurrg
may be ill-tempered,

09:18.464 --> 09:20.590
but she's much faster
than your riding machines.

09:21.409 --> 09:23.109
I don't know about that.

09:34.731 --> 09:36.398
What is this, a scratch?

09:38.282 --> 09:40.777
Gobi, get better. I need you.

09:43.614 --> 09:45.336
We have little food or drink,

09:45.461 --> 09:48.910
but it is our tradition to share
what we do have with our guests.

09:59.137 --> 10:01.683
Target every Twi'lek village
in range,

10:01.998 --> 10:04.809
- the inhabited ones first.
- Of course.

10:18.223 --> 10:20.425
Our scouts reported in
from the village up ahead.

10:20.550 --> 10:24.321
The enemy's already pulled out{\, sir}. {\Friendlies are all that's left, mostly women and children.}
Women and children are all that's left.

10:24.723 --> 10:27.449
See if we can spare some rations.
They'll be hungry.

10:27.864 --> 10:30.414
Sir, enemy ships
are entering our sector.

10:36.973 --> 10:39.413
- Damage report!
- There's no tactical damage, sir.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.880
It didn't hit us.
They bombed the village.

10:51.174 --> 10:53.274
Make contact with General Windu.

11:01.456 --> 11:03.467
I hope you don't mind this.

11:04.411 --> 11:08.411
A little distraction goes far
to ease the burden of the war on my men.

11:08.919 --> 11:12.119
You have provided well for your men,
all your people.

11:12.665 --> 11:15.121
So why won't you help me
free them from this occupation?

11:15.554 --> 11:19.625
I don't trust senator Ta, his plans
for our world after the war.

11:20.234 --> 11:22.346
The Republic will help you rebuild.

11:22.471 --> 11:25.966
- We won't abandon you.
- Your troops will stay for security?

11:26.914 --> 11:28.851
For a while, to keep the peace.

11:29.095 --> 11:32.130
Another armed occupation
is not a free Ryloth.

11:32.894 --> 11:35.809
How long before I am fighting you,
Master Jedi?

11:40.006 --> 11:40.981
What is it{\, Commander}?

11:41.149 --> 11:43.172
<i>The droids have begun
a firebombing campaign.</i>

11:43.297 --> 11:45.694
<i>Several villages in our sector
have been destroyed, sir.</i>

11:56.846 --> 11:58.445
Make the arrangements.

11:58.570 --> 12:00.263
I will speak to senator Ta.

12:06.007 --> 12:07.215
Is this all of it?

12:07.729 --> 12:11.279
We are still awaiting two transports
from our southern base.

12:11.414 --> 12:13.833
- Should we depart without them?
- No.

12:13.958 --> 12:17.258
I will have every valuable on this rock
before I leave.

12:17.733 --> 12:20.491
<i>Emir Tambor,
why haven't you evacuated?</i>

12:21.052 --> 12:24.996
Our exit strategy
is taking more time to implement.

12:25.729 --> 12:29.351
<i>I want you out of the city
before the Republic arrives.</i>

12:29.748 --> 12:32.398
<i>Once Master Windu
has invaded the capital,</i>

12:32.730 --> 12:34.580
<i>you will bomb it from afar.</i>

12:34.954 --> 12:37.454
<i>- Am I understood?
- Yes, count Dooku.</i>

12:39.104 --> 12:42.063
You will not do anything
until I give the order.

12:42.744 --> 12:44.494
We have our orders, Emir.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.175
Senator Ta,

12:52.497 --> 12:55.697
so glad you could join us
from comfortable Coruscant.

12:55.998 --> 12:58.448
Our people have survived
with only me.

12:58.928 --> 13:02.678
<i>I knew you would try to turn this
into a campaign to take power.</i>

13:03.018 --> 13:05.262
<i>Need I remind you that it is I</i>

13:05.944 --> 13:07.817
<i>who leads our people in the senate?</i>

13:08.354 --> 13:11.319
And it is I who leads our people
here and now.

13:11.989 --> 13:15.291
There will be nothing left to lead
if you two refuse to work together.

13:15.416 --> 13:18.536
<i>- General Windu, do you copy?
- I hear you, Skywalker.</i>

13:19.104 --> 13:20.946
My fighters are taking out
the bombers

13:21.071 --> 13:23.458
as fast as they can,
{\Master Windu, }but there are just too many.

13:23.731 --> 13:25.417
<i>I doubt we can stop them all.</i>

13:25.542 --> 13:27.986
<i>I suggest you get the people
away from the cities.</i>

13:28.111 --> 13:30.451
You must destroy those bombers,
Skywalker.

13:30.576 --> 13:33.718
<i>- Then meet me at the capitol.
- I'll do what I can.</i>

13:39.994 --> 13:42.394
<i>What can the Separatists
hope to gain</i>

13:42.691 --> 13:44.270
<i>from burning our homes?</i>

13:44.564 --> 13:45.564
Nothing.

13:45.773 --> 13:48.983
Wat Tambor spoils for others
what he cannot possess.

13:49.479 --> 13:51.069
<i>Then we must act quickly.</i>

13:51.354 --> 13:53.887
Senator,
your people are hesitant to join us

13:54.012 --> 13:56.783
because they're worried there'll be
another military occupation.

13:57.373 --> 13:59.706
<i>The people have my promise</i>

14:00.465 --> 14:02.465
<i>that the clone army will leave</i>

14:02.824 --> 14:05.917
<i>once Ryloth is free of those droids.</i>

14:08.425 --> 14:12.429
What assurance can you give Senator Ta
you will not try to assume power?

14:12.967 --> 14:15.867
I only want to see my people free,
Master Jedi.

14:16.306 --> 14:17.556
I give my word.

14:17.994 --> 14:19.597
I believe in democracy.

14:21.781 --> 14:23.731
Then we are together in this.

14:28.290 --> 14:29.490
Men of Ryloth,

14:30.404 --> 14:31.754
the time has come

14:32.505 --> 14:34.138
to free ourselves!

14:54.940 --> 14:56.040
Keep moving.

15:01.459 --> 15:03.109
Try and keep up, clone.

15:14.470 --> 15:15.920
Tambor is still there.

15:16.334 --> 15:19.434
How are we going to attack
with my people so close?

15:19.944 --> 15:21.583
Your people will never be in danger

15:21.708 --> 15:24.146
if our walkers can cross the bridge
into the city.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.514
The key is getting control
of that bridge.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.140
Perhaps there is your way.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.774
My spies tell me those transports
carry treasure.

15:36.942 --> 15:39.152
You think we can use them
to get across the bridge?

15:39.565 --> 15:42.765
It is risky.
They are usually scanned while crossing.

15:53.646 --> 15:56.669
When I get control of the bridge,
you must start the attack.

16:09.535 --> 16:10.975
They're in. Let's go.

16:20.011 --> 16:22.487
Commander,
I'll need you to create a diversion.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.894
<i>Get the rest
of Lightning squadron ready.</i>

16:25.019 --> 16:26.019
Yes, sir.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.250
My men are ready.

16:33.042 --> 16:34.526
It is time to leave.

16:34.651 --> 16:37.502
The Republic walkers
are holding at 1,200 meters.

16:38.651 --> 16:41.422
Sir, the last shipments of treasure
are approaching.

16:41.858 --> 16:43.008
Just in time.

16:43.448 --> 16:46.386
Activate the bridge
and get them across immediately.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.224
Initiating plasma projectors.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.398
All right, hold it there.

17:22.525 --> 17:24.775
Let's go. The boss wants this done.

17:36.344 --> 17:37.645
This one's all clear.

17:38.045 --> 17:39.105
Here they come.

17:41.717 --> 17:44.317
Wait!
I'm picking up an anomaly in there.

17:44.962 --> 17:46.012
Stay alert.

17:51.883 --> 17:53.633
Trooper, prepare to fire.

17:54.088 --> 17:55.643
Open the cargo hatch.

17:59.284 --> 18:02.266
- Oh, no!
- You're under arrest. You have the r...

18:02.927 --> 18:04.377
We're under attack!

18:09.679 --> 18:11.012
Deactivate the bridge!

18:11.716 --> 18:13.546
Well. Too bad for them.

18:14.088 --> 18:16.309
Run for it!
They're turning the bridge off!

18:45.417 --> 18:48.090
I'll hold them off.
Get that bridge back up.

18:48.304 --> 18:49.329
Sir, yes, sir!

18:50.260 --> 18:51.260
Charge!

19:20.942 --> 19:21.874
Save it.

19:25.402 --> 19:26.802
Bridge is up, sir.

19:52.030 --> 19:54.866
You take these droids.
I'll go find Wat Tambor.

20:25.797 --> 20:26.689
My ship!

20:31.978 --> 20:35.489
I'm afraid Emir Tambor refused
to retreat in time.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.356
<i>That is... Unfortunate.</i>

20:39.192 --> 20:42.121
<i>Order our bombers
to destroy the capitol immediately.</i>

20:53.755 --> 20:54.755
Surrender.

20:55.503 --> 20:58.802
General Windu,
perhaps we can come to a compromise.

20:59.405 --> 21:01.405
Not when I hold all the cards.

21:01.815 --> 21:04.685
It appears a surrender
is unnecessary.

21:05.033 --> 21:08.439
We will all perish for the glory
of the Separatist alliance.

21:16.869 --> 21:19.951
- That was close, Master.
- Isn't it always, snips?

21:23.536 --> 21:25.539
What are your terms for surrender?

21:26.284 --> 21:27.833
They're unconditional.

21:29.629 --> 21:30.629
Agreed.

21:31.839 --> 21:33.589
I thank you, Master Jedi.

21:33.949 --> 21:36.347
Today, all of Ryloth thanks you.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.297
You're earned your freedom, General,
all of you.
