should you push?

13:44.920 --> 13:49.630
No, if the head's born too quickly,
the mother's skin might tear.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.757
Yes. Very good.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.674
Maybe we could let one of the mums
answer the next one.

13:56.120 --> 14:00.750
As the baby's head appears,
the midwife checks the umbilical cord.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.796
Why?

14:04.680 --> 14:06.875
Go on. You know. Go on, say it.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.076
Go on.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.236
Anyone.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.471
To ensure it isn't looped around
the baby's neck.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.516
Yes. Very good.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.836
Swot.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.236
Sorry, mate.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.596

14:31.680 --> 14:33.636
Mmm! With frilly bits.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.196
- Are you still wearing 'em?
- No, they go right up my arse.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.079
- What do you think it all means?
- That you like wearing Rachel's knicks?

14:42.160 --> 14:44.390
No, that she wants to spend more time
at her place.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.278
- Why does it have to mean anything?
- Everything has meaning.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.116
Maybe she's going off me.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.758
Ah! Bodger and Grabbit,
how's it going?

- Ah. We can't be sure.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.948
A boy in a pink room. Who knows?

15:06.040 --> 15:08.873
He might end up
wearing women's panties.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.235
Jen, a hypothetical situation.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.517
A couple spend
most of their time at his place.

15:14.600 --> 15:19.196
Then she wants to spend more time at her flat.
What do you read into that?

15:19.280 --> 15:21.316
That Rachel's going off you.

15:22.560 --> 15:26.838
Or maybe, maybe she's just sick
of always ending up at yours.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.519
Well, which is it?

15:28.600 --> 15:32.275
Adam, l imagine that Rachel would move in
with you if you asked her,

15:32.360 --> 15:34.874
but in the absence of an invitation...

15:35.320 --> 15:38.835
- You think she's angling to move in?
- lt might have crossed her mind.

15:57.560 --> 16:01.917

but in the end he was begging me.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.036
Sorry. The meeting ran over.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.432
- How's your day been?
- Fine.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.476
Hi, David.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.477
And Josh? Has he done any crayoning?

16:11.560 --> 16:14.677
Yes, David. lt made him sick.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.671
Maybe he should start on paints.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.716
What's this?

16:18.920 --> 16:21.150
And you're supposed to be a nanny.

16:21.240 --> 16:24.630
- lt's potty.
- No, it's a potty.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.355
Ramona was right the first time.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.635

16:29.720 --> 16:31.153

16:31.240 --> 16:33.276
Why doesn't that surprise me?

16:33.360 --> 16:36.557
Am l the only one
concerned with his development?

16:36.640 --> 16:38.915
You haven't seen him for two days.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.912
- l looked in on him.
- Oh, hands-on parenting.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.992

16:45.080 --> 16:46.035

16:46.120 --> 16:49.635
Fine, Ramona.
Take your chicken into the lounge.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.160
No wonder Josh is inarticulate
if that's his role model.

16:53.240 --> 16:56.198
- David, she's trying.
- That's certainly true.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.475
l think we should get rid of her.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.916

with childcare and English skills.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.468
No way, David. Josh is very fond of Ramona.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.516
She's like a father to him.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.070

isn't something you fax from the office.

Anyway, Jen,
you should be conserving energy.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.993
- lf not for labour, for what comes after.
- Right, so just to recap.

26:42.080 --> 26:46.039
My life is going to be rubbish.

26:46.640 --> 26:51.395
The world ''life'' won't apply. You will simply exist
to meet your child's demands.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.789
No, l wouldn't call it demanding.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.599
ln fact, l've hardly noticed a change.

26:57.480 --> 27:01.075
l think these things
tend to get a bit exaggerated.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.391
That's encouraging.

27:03.480 --> 27:06.153
Well, l wouldn't have it any other way.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.800
There again, l wouldn't have another one either.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.116
Er, Karen. Can l have a word?

27:23.080 --> 27:24.911
Aw, sweet.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.639
What are you doing with Josh's clothes?

27:27.720 --> 27:30.598
- Giving them to Jenny.
- What if we need them again?

27:30.680 --> 27:32.716
David, he's grown out of them.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.756
l mean, for the next one.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.916
What next one?

27:37.360 --> 27:39.316
l've been thinking.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.710
- lt's time Josh had a baby brother.
- What?

27:41.800 --> 27:43.756
Or sister.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.877
- You said you wanted three children.
- That was before l had one.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.353
Do you think
we should tell his parents?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.795
l think we should leave them alone
at the moment.

- Oh, shite!

27:59.880 --> 28:01.836
Yeah. Not good.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.558
Get a newspaper.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.551
Then roll it up and smack him.

28:05.640 --> 28:09.599
The teacher said
an only child tends to be anti-social.

28:09.680 --> 28:13.798
- We do not want him expelled.
- Great! So, l have to get pregnant again.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.678

- l'll get your coat.

- You two seemed so sure.

- Competitive juices are flowing.
- lt's the nearest l get to sport now.

28:38.480 --> 28:41.995
- You don't strike me as the athletic type.
- Excuse me.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.117
- Hundred metres hurdles for the school.
- Mm. Under 1 2s.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.397
- Well, you never forget.
- Golf is the sport you want to play.

28:48.480 --> 28:52.951
Golf! Golf's not a sport,
it's a career move. Same again, lads?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.871

28:54.960 --> 28:57.918

28:58.480 --> 29:01.790
l was hoping Josh
might show an aptitude for golf.

29:01.880 --> 29:05.793
Did you know that Tiger Woods
hit his first ball at the age of two?

29:07.320 --> 29:09.276
- Really?
- Mm.

29:09.760 --> 29:13.435
Do you know if you're expecting
a tiger or a tigress?

a football score before watching it on telly.

- l wouldn't miss it for the world.

29:23.280 --> 29:26.113

but Jenny put her foot down.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.075
Are you two still discussing golf?

29:29.160 --> 29:31.833
- Childbirth.
- Magic.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.480
When you have a baby, Adam,
do you intend to be there?

29:34.560 --> 29:36.755
Are you wise? All that blood?

29:37.520 --> 29:39.351
And genitalia. Ergh!

29:39.440 --> 29:41.112
Being at the conception's enough.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.112
Make sure she doesn't conceive
on a Monday.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.997
Why?

29:46.080 --> 29:48.196
Mondays we don't see each other.

29:48.280 --> 29:52.637
Two days we're at Adam's, two days at mine.
And weekends we alternate.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.551

29:54.640 --> 29:56.471
Sounds like a divorce settlement.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.552

Nowhere feels like home.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.790

31:34.480 --> 31:36.436

32:18.760 --> 32:20.716
Just checking.

the blue one cos...

No. Could you just stop it, please?

Adam.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.312
Hi, Jen. How's it going?

40:39.400 --> 40:40.992
This isn't your husband.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.991
He's on his way.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.832
- OK, l've got it.
- The hospital?

40:44.920 --> 40:46.990
Old Trafford, but it's very near.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.913
Possibly.
Look, l can wait outside, if you prefer.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.956
Arrrgh!

40:53.760 --> 40:56.274
This time of day, it's the blue route,

40:56.360 --> 40:58.271
so we go left here.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.316
And then right. Right.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.196
Oh, shit!

Officers, this is an emergency.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.838

- My wife's giving birth.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.036
ls this true?

41:17.400 --> 41:20.119
Every father should see his child into the world.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.156
Matthews, your helmet.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.556
What stage am l at?

41:33.800 --> 41:37.588
l'm no expert,
but l'd definitely say it was labour.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.591
(CRlES OUT)

41:39.680 --> 41:42.990
Two minutes twenty-three.
They're getting closer.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.435
You're fully dilated now, Jenny.

41:45.840 --> 41:47.956
Wooh. Tell me what you can see.

41:48.120 --> 41:50.190

only push with your contractions.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.396
And remember your breathing.

Nothing prepares you for it, nothing.

46:30.800 --> 46:35.078
She was brilliant.
The sweat was lashing, dripping off her.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.758
She really grabbed my hand at one point.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.116
And it was fantastic.

46:42.320 --> 46:47.474
And then this life comes out,
and there it is, and that's there.

and she did all that herself...
