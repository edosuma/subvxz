WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:04.272
Previously on S.W.A.T...
All right, want you
to fill the gaps, stay liquid.

00:04.305 --> 00:07.375
You with us, Hondo?
Fill the gaps, stay
liquid. You say it

00:07.408 --> 00:09.410
so damn much, Buck, I finally
got it tattooed on my ass.

00:09.443 --> 00:09.777
(laughter)

00:10.344 --> 00:11.512
All right, here we go!

00:13.147 --> 00:13.747
(gunfire)

00:15.349 --> 00:18.052
HICKS:
17-year-old young man, Raymont
Harris, was accidentally shot

00:18.086 --> 00:20.488
and seriously injured
by team leader Buck Spivey.

00:20.754 --> 00:21.555
This morning,

00:22.690 --> 00:24.792
I terminated Sergeant Spivey.
Today, I am assigning

00:24.825 --> 00:27.495
command of this unit
to Sergeant Harrelson.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.531
(applause)

00:30.564 --> 00:32.066
I asked Hicks to put Street

00:32.100 --> 00:34.068
on the team in my place.
Jim... Street.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.736
This is wrong.
It's your job now.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.577
You have plans
tomorrow night?
(laughs)

00:43.611 --> 00:45.779
You know, actually, um,

00:45.813 --> 00:47.481
I was thinking about
asking this woman

00:47.515 --> 00:49.317
that I work with
out to dinner.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.285
I'm just not sure
what she might say.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.686
Maybe she's not
into it.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.288
(laughs)
Please.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.823
Oh, she's into it.
Oh.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.658
Trust me, she's into it.
(laughs)

00:57.691 --> 01:00.628
It's just, um,
she's my boss.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.296
Ah.
I know.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.298
Sounds inappropriate.
No, it is.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.500
We have to keep
the whole thing a secret,

01:06.534 --> 01:08.136
we can't be seen together.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.403
You know,
all that stupid stuff.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.240
Might be tricky.
Mm.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.275
Or it might be
kind of exciting.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.310
Where you going?

01:16.344 --> 01:17.811
Hey.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.547
What, are we playing
hide-and-seek?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.582
Happy anniversary.

01:21.615 --> 01:22.783
Anniversary?

01:22.816 --> 01:24.818
Our 13-week anniversary.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.188
What?
(both laughing)

01:27.221 --> 01:29.323
Okay. 13 weeks?

01:29.357 --> 01:31.659
It's no big deal.
I just... I just saw it,

01:31.692 --> 01:33.594
wanted to get it
for you, so I did.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.363
(sighs)

01:35.396 --> 01:38.332
Baby, it is a damn nice shirt.

01:38.366 --> 01:41.402
I know.
(laughs)
Yeah, of course you do.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.371
There. You look
very handsome.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.738
Hmm.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.741
Give me a decent head
start to Deacon's, okay?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.877
So it doesn't look like
we're arriving together.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.612
All right. Spot you
what, five minutes?

01:51.645 --> 01:53.914
Make it ten.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.883
*

02:26.314 --> 02:28.216
(glass shattering)

02:30.284 --> 02:32.220
(car alarms blaring)

02:36.490 --> 02:40.728
* Lean on me
when times are bad *

02:40.761 --> 02:45.199
* When the day comes
and you are down *

02:45.233 --> 02:46.834
* In a river of trouble...

02:46.867 --> 02:51.339
Matthew's tooth is hanging
by a thread.
Already?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.806
Been looking all over
for you, Annie.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.542
Congratulations
to you both.
Oh.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.810
Oh, hey,
thank you.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.413
Where's the baby?
Oh, Grandma's
putting him down.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.449
Baptism was
a bit much.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.884
Although he did a lot better
than our last two.
Yeah.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.419
Kid's tough. He's definitely
SWAT material.

03:05.453 --> 03:08.256
Oh, hey, over my dead body.
(laughs)

03:08.289 --> 03:09.690
Hey, you seen Hondo here yet?

03:09.723 --> 03:12.760
No. I'm sure
he's on his way, though. Why?

03:12.793 --> 03:15.729
You'll see. Oh,
speak of the devil.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.565
HONDO:
Hey, Annie.

03:17.598 --> 03:20.301
Hi.
How are you?
Okay, everyone, gather up.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.535
Gather up. This way.
MAN: Hey, everyone,
come around.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.870
Good luck.
Huh?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.272
MAN: Come up front.
CHRIS:
Gather 'round, everyone.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.506
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

03:25.539 --> 03:26.774
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, wow.
Yup.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.243
HONDO:
Wow. Okay.
LUCA: All right.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.678
Yeah.
Oh!
MAN: Yeah. See?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.413
Okay, the bad news is

03:32.446 --> 03:34.482
there is no Jackass of the
Month to hand out today.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.485
But the good news is
there's a Jackass of the Year!

03:37.518 --> 03:40.921
(cheering and whooping)
This month's infraction
was a doozy, because one

03:40.954 --> 03:42.823
of our own was pictured
very prominently

03:42.856 --> 03:44.992
in the Sunday papers.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.960
(booing)
On the front page,

03:46.994 --> 03:49.597
above the fold!
(jeering)

03:49.630 --> 03:50.864
Ladies and gents,

03:50.898 --> 03:52.633
it is my distinct
displeasure

03:52.666 --> 03:55.969
to present Jackass
of the Year to, uh,

03:56.003 --> 03:59.340
shameless media darling
Daniel "Hondo" Harrelson.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.008
(jeering)

04:01.041 --> 04:02.376
Come forward
to receive your punishment.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.677
MAN:
This way.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.646
Anything you'd
like to say?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.481
Yeah, I got something to say.
Y'all are fired.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.484
(laughter)
I would not
like to thank

04:10.518 --> 04:12.420
the photographer
who took this picture.

04:12.453 --> 04:15.489
And to the newspaper
that published it, I curse you.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.991
And certainly no thanks to Annie

04:18.025 --> 04:19.827
and Deacon,
our ungracious hosts.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.629
(whooping, applause)

04:21.662 --> 04:23.997
(whoops)
Hey, but
seriously, um...

04:24.031 --> 04:26.534
(laughs)

04:26.567 --> 04:28.636
I never asked for this job,
you know?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.671
But...

04:30.704 --> 04:34.375
I couldn't be prouder
of this team.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.877
* Hold on, I'm comin'...

04:36.910 --> 04:38.446
(all booing)
Punishment!

04:38.479 --> 04:40.914
(chanting):
Punishment! Punishment!

04:40.948 --> 04:42.483
Okay, we need a picture
for the wall of shame.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.553
I think Hondo's
got a new girl.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.088
Why is that?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.658
Well, don't tell me he bought
that shirt for himself.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.893
I mean, that's
a woman's touch. (laughs)

04:52.926 --> 04:55.295
I haven't heard
about anyone new.

04:57.365 --> 05:00.334
Hey, um, I know
Deacon felt passed over

05:00.368 --> 05:01.969
when he wasn't made
team leader.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.904
How's he holding up?

05:03.937 --> 05:06.507
You don't have to worry about
my husband causing a problem.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.709
How are you doing?

05:08.742 --> 05:12.613
Look, I know it's tough,
being a cop, but...

05:12.646 --> 05:15.015
sometimes I think
it's tougher loving one.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.919
I thought Buck
was coming today.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.389
Yeah, so did I.
Hmm.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.823
Have you talked
to him lately?
No.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.925
Not in a while.
Hmm.
(phone beeping)

05:24.958 --> 05:27.695
Sorry.
Yeah.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.763
Everyone,
you're all about to get it.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.465
(phones beeping)

05:42.075 --> 05:43.411
Come here. You
know the drill.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.712
I got to go. You
take care of Mom.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.913
Okay.
Okay, come here.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.548
(grunts)
(laughs)

05:47.581 --> 05:49.016
What about you?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.884
You gonna take care?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.820
Piece of cake.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.956
Okay, you
be good.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.057
Ooh.
(laughs)

05:58.926 --> 06:00.961
I'm sorry to leave
you with the mess.

06:00.994 --> 06:04.398
Ah. What I get for planning
a party when the team's on call.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.536
How about we go check out
that tooth, huh, Mister?

06:08.569 --> 06:12.005
Okay.
(inhales sharply)

06:12.039 --> 06:15.509
(helicopter whirring)

06:20.948 --> 06:22.082
(garbled radio transmission)

06:22.115 --> 06:23.717
Deacon, Chris,

06:23.751 --> 06:26.153
get these
people back.
Roger.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.556
I need two uniforms
right here.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.159
LUCA:
Guessing

06:32.192 --> 06:33.894
this wasn't a gas leak.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.829
The gas lines are intact.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.498
This one's
for the bomb boys.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.734
Hey, what are we looking at,
Reggie?

06:40.768 --> 06:41.935
Detect any explosive materials?

06:41.969 --> 06:43.637
Yes, sir.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.172
From what we're finding,

06:45.205 --> 06:47.441
this place is practically
a bomb-making factory.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.742
So there might
be more of these

06:48.776 --> 06:50.911
already out there?

06:53.213 --> 06:55.015
Street, techs haven't
cleared that yet.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.184
Yeah, I hear something.
Is somebody in there?

06:57.217 --> 06:59.553
Hey, hey, over here, over here.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.722
I need help over here.
We got a survivor.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.757
Bring me that gurney.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.460
Luca, we got to
get this thing up.

07:06.494 --> 07:09.897
All right, careful.
On three.
One, two... three!

07:09.930 --> 07:12.833
(creaking,
men groaning)

07:12.866 --> 07:15.669
We're right here. Hey.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.871
Hey, I'm Hondo.
What's your name?

07:17.905 --> 07:20.541
Maya.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.910
I was vacuuming
inside my apartment.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.078
I'm having people over tonight.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.614
Why am I outside?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.482
Okay, no, no, no.
Look at me.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.551
Look at me. I need your eyes.
Keep your eyes on me.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.521
I can't feel anything.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.922
Is that weird?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.557
No, no, no,
that's not weird. That's...

07:36.590 --> 07:37.858
That's normal, Maya.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.762
MAYA:
My whole building is gone?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.164
Are the guys
next door okay?

07:44.197 --> 07:45.999
(panting)

07:46.033 --> 07:47.668
What happened?

07:47.701 --> 07:48.636
We're gonna find out.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.470
These people are gonna
take care of you, okay?

07:54.642 --> 07:56.577
(garbled radio transmission)

08:02.282 --> 08:04.251
STREET:
Pretty big explosion.

08:04.284 --> 08:08.188
Yeah. And this might
just be the beginning.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.628
*

08:44.357 --> 08:47.294
STREET: That's a lot
of lead-acid batteries.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.296
How big an arsenal
did this guy have?

08:49.329 --> 08:50.931
Go introduce
yourself to Reggie.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.966
See what else
he's finding.
Reggie?

08:53.333 --> 08:55.302
He's the lead bomb squad
operator, the big guy.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.105
Go ahead. Everybody
loves Reggie.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.708
Hondo, this is Agent Conley,
point for the FBI.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.309
Eileen, Hondo.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.077
He's our newest
SWAT team leader.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.747
One fatality? That's confirmed?
Just the bomb builder himself.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.248
Adam Jarrett, 24.
HICKS:
Still don't know

09:08.281 --> 09:10.217
if he made any others
before this one, though.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.318
Or what he was planning
on doing with them.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.753
CONLEY:
Well, we have our suspicions.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.187
Adam made our watch list
last month,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.189
surfing pro-jihad Web sites.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.091
We found this in
the wreckage, too.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.261
Published in Yemen.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.863
Any extremist connections
to anyone here in L.A.?

09:22.896 --> 09:25.098
Unknown. Could be a lone wolf.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.200
Either way,
there are a few doors

09:27.234 --> 09:29.069
in the Muslim community
we've been wanting to knock on.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.672
This gives us
our opportunity to do so.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.273
SWAT's here
to assist.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.008
Well, the survivor
from 2A, Maya--

09:35.042 --> 09:37.110
she asked about
"the guys next door."

09:37.144 --> 09:39.312
This Adam kid might not have
been working by himself.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.181
Well, he was
the only one on the lease.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.016
We'll check out
our watch list most likelys

09:43.050 --> 09:45.919
if you can look
into Adam's local contacts.

09:45.953 --> 09:49.022
Let's keep talking.
We're here to help.
Okay, great.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.791
Hey, listen up. These
high-end batteries--

09:50.824 --> 09:51.925
no more than a dozen
stores in L.A. sell 'em.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.794
Let's find a record
of that purchase.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.096
We're on it.
Street,
you're with me.

09:56.129 --> 09:59.599
We're gonna continue
your education today.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.710
Hey, Maya.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.645
Do you remember us?

10:11.679 --> 10:13.213
Doctors said I
would've suffocated

10:13.246 --> 10:15.015
if you hadn't found
me when you did.

10:15.048 --> 10:15.916
Are you cops?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.118
Metro SWAT.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.853
I talked
to your doctor.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.690
She's optimistic that
you're gonna be fine.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.925
I've never had surgery before.
STREET: Don't sweat it.
Surgeons at this place--

10:24.958 --> 10:27.761
they can do anything.
WOMAN:
It's time.

10:27.795 --> 10:30.163
Okay, Maya,
I just have one question.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.232
At the explosion, you asked
about the guys next door.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.834
Was there someone else
living with Adam?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.268
I don't know if
he lived there,

10:35.302 --> 10:37.905
but he was always around.

10:37.938 --> 10:41.942
Kyle or-or Kevin. Maybe Kenny?

10:41.975 --> 10:45.545
I was worried that
maybe he was hurt, too.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.719
I just don't get it.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.787
Adam seemed like a normal guy.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.756
Why would he do something
like this?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.859
I don't know.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.861
Maya, you're gonna be good.

11:00.894 --> 11:01.929
Okay?

11:04.231 --> 11:04.564
(phone chimes)

11:04.597 --> 11:04.631
Hey, Street.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.336
I need you find
a ride back to HQ.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.905
What happened
to continuing my education?

11:11.939 --> 11:14.107
This is someone I got
to talk to, alone.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.146
(door opens)

11:19.179 --> 11:20.914
Hey, Hondo.
Haven't seen you

11:20.948 --> 11:22.983
since the
fantasy draft.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.452
What place you in?
I think you know
the answer, Tarek.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.388
Second to last?
Dead last.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.857
Just wanted to hear you say it.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.191
(chuckles)

11:31.224 --> 11:32.726
See you, ladies.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.963
I got your text.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.265
Saw the bombing on the
news-- wanted to help.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.933
This guy's a
homegrown terrorist?

11:39.967 --> 11:41.869
Possible. Too early to tell.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.805
Hmm. People say it's,
uh, faith versus faith.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.239
But that's a lie.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.441
It's decent people
versus barbarians.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.343
Show me who your
suspect is--

11:50.377 --> 11:52.746
I'll ask around the mosques,
see if he's been around,

11:52.780 --> 11:55.215
if anyone knows him.
I was hoping
you might say that.

11:55.248 --> 11:59.186
His name is Adam Jarrett.
White kid?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.755
I know. Now, he
may have been working

12:01.789 --> 12:03.857
with a friend--
if this is true,

12:03.891 --> 12:06.426
we're very interested
in finding out who he is
and what his connection

12:06.459 --> 12:08.528
to your community might be.
I learn anything, I'll
let you know immediately.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.497
You always do.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.232
Thanks, Tarek.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.367
I've been busy
in your absence.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.770
Found the store that sold
our bombers high-end batteries.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.772
Farm & Garden
in Shadow Hills.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.775
We need to get
that to the FBI.
Already did.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.510
Did you have the store
run his name through

12:23.543 --> 12:25.045
credit card purchase logs?
Did that, too--
Chris pulled

12:25.078 --> 12:27.147
the last three weeks
of checkout line surveillance.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.516
Any sign of Adam?
That's Adam buying
eight chrome batteries

12:29.549 --> 12:31.151
and a hell of a lot
more ammonium

12:31.184 --> 12:32.853
than was in that apartment.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.788
That would have taken
out the entire block.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.257
So there are more bombs
still out there.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.959
Yeah, but the good news is,
we got some pictures

12:38.992 --> 12:40.427
of the accomplice--
haven't ID'd him yet,

12:40.460 --> 12:41.829
but whoever he is...

12:41.862 --> 12:44.197
Just became our
top priority.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.033
All right, Street, whatever
they were planning,

12:46.066 --> 12:48.568
Adam going boom is gonna make
his buddies speed things up.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.103
We need a name.
Working it.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.977
There he is.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.917
Thanks for
swinging by, Buck.
Mm-hmm.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.253
Missed you earlier at Deac's.
I didn't want to
make it awkward.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.522
Nobody wants to talk
about me getting the heave-ho.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.858
Don't worry about it.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.425
You're my guest.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.295
Hey, listen, I've been,
uh, meaning to ask.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.264
That kid I shot--
Raymont--

13:17.297 --> 13:19.299
you ever... you ever
hear how he's doing?

13:19.332 --> 13:20.567
Yeah.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.235
I've been looking
in on him.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.938
He's back on his feet, Buck,
way ahead of schedule.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.239
That's great. That's great.
Mm-hmm.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.575
You know, I've been wanting
to reach out to him,

13:28.608 --> 13:31.211
but the department's
lawyers said until
a settlement's negotiated...

13:31.244 --> 13:32.880
Listen, do you think

13:32.913 --> 13:35.515
he would ever let me
tell him how sorry I am?

13:35.548 --> 13:37.617
I'll ask Raymont and
his mom when the time is
right-- I'd be happy to.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.020
LUCA: Hey, Buck.
Great. Thanks.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.288
Hey.
What are you doing here, man?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.857
I'm not, uh,
I'm not really sure.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.859
I was hoping you could take
a look at something for me.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.227
Come on.
Come here.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.632
It was no half-assed
pressure cooker, was it?

13:52.665 --> 13:55.102
This kid knew
what he was doing.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.236
We think he may have
finished a few these

13:56.269 --> 13:58.872
before he blew himself up.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.941
Street's trying to ID
his buddy right now.
All right, I'm on it.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.575
Later, Buck. Don't be
a stranger, okay?

14:02.609 --> 14:05.045
See you, brother.
So listen.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.380
Once we get a name
on the second guy,

14:07.414 --> 14:09.549
I could use your expertise--
what do you say?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.018
What do I say to what?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.654
Help me out?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.924
Just for the day,
off the record.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.358
Come on, you and I
both know I'm poison

14:18.391 --> 14:19.526
in this building
since the shooting.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.261
You're probably gonna
get a reprimand

14:21.294 --> 14:23.096
just for walking
me through here.
Hicks won't care

14:23.130 --> 14:24.597
as long as he gets
the credit, and you
know that. Come on, Buck.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.133
You've secured
more explosives

14:26.166 --> 14:28.201
than most people
in this room have ever seen.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.937
It's never about
the bombs, right?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.471
It's always about the
guys who make them,

14:31.504 --> 14:33.306
and they're all the same.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.375
How's that?

14:35.408 --> 14:37.945
Nobody's pushes a button
until they stop feeling human.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.313
And I just kept 'em human.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.050
(chuckles) I see what
you're trying to do here.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.352
You're trying to... trying
to make me feel useful.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.256
Buck...
Yeah?

14:49.289 --> 14:50.991
...you got screwed, man.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.360
No hearing, no review.
Come on.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.996
That's 100% Hicks trying
to cover his own ass.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.200
I could still use you here.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.470
I'm not gonna be responsible
for you getting fired, too.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.206
Now, you got this.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.541
I'm gonna beat it
before, you know,

15:08.575 --> 15:11.211
people start thinking
this is a thing.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.647
Listen, I, uh...

15:14.681 --> 15:17.150
I never rooted for
days like this,

15:17.184 --> 15:20.053
but, you know, chasing them down
before they did any more harm,

15:20.087 --> 15:21.989
they were always my favorite.

15:25.092 --> 15:28.095
Thanks. Good luck.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.397
LUCA: Hey, time stamp
on the photo matched

15:30.430 --> 15:31.698
a debit card swipe--
we got a name.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.170
Cross-referenced
his image with the DMV.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.405
Second guy in the photo
with our bomber,

15:38.438 --> 15:39.706
his name is
Kevin Lynch.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.474
If he spent lots of time
in that apartment,

15:41.508 --> 15:43.410
he's a real threat.
He might be the ringleader.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.711
And he has his own place.
We're headed there now.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.313
What else do we know about him?
Attended

15:46.346 --> 15:48.115
Cameron College with Adam.
Dropped out a month ago.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.316
DEACON:
Listen up. Good chance he's

15:49.349 --> 15:51.151
sitting on more bombs.
What's up, Hondo?

15:51.184 --> 15:52.585
DEACON:
Watch every step.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.224
Hondo.

15:57.257 --> 16:00.127
Take this guy down,
but be careful, okay?

16:00.160 --> 16:02.329
Piece of cake.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.033
STREET: Hey.
Buck was here?

16:06.066 --> 16:08.068
Yeah.
I didn't get
to see him.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.636
Is he coming back later?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.571
I don't think so, Street.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.640
(sirens wailing)

16:13.673 --> 16:15.108
(laughing, whooping)

16:15.142 --> 16:16.376
Eyes ahead on
the cross-traffic.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.578
*

16:23.516 --> 16:26.319
Clear!

16:26.353 --> 16:28.088
(booming explosion)
STREET:
Whoa!

16:36.729 --> 16:37.664
(tires squealing)

16:45.738 --> 16:50.743
*

16:56.116 --> 16:57.084
Reggie says
it's ammonium nitrate

16:58.017 --> 16:59.752
packed in there with C-4,
same as earlier.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.289
Also says he can't
believe no one died.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.724
If Kevin's waging jihad, he's
not doing a very good job.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.426
You got something?

17:06.459 --> 17:08.295
The building security cameras.

17:08.328 --> 17:11.064
Kevin called in a bomb threat
just a few minutes

17:11.098 --> 17:14.134
after he dropped the backpack
in the second floor lobby.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.635
(helicopter blades whirring)
(sighs)

17:15.668 --> 17:18.305
Who are the other tenants
in the building?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.140
Investment firms,
med firms...

17:20.173 --> 17:22.609
Metzler Financial,
Sherman & Ross.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.711
Why bomb this place?

17:24.744 --> 17:27.847
Agent. The kid
called in a bomb scare

17:27.880 --> 17:29.716
to clear the lobby.
I'm aware.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.184
But wouldn't a
terrorist be going

17:31.218 --> 17:32.185
for the highest
body count?

17:32.219 --> 17:33.553
Not all terrorists think alike.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.455
All those doors
you've been knocking down

17:35.488 --> 17:37.857
in the Muslim community--
you get anything?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.093
Related to this? No.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.461
All due respect, Agent,
I've been going

17:41.494 --> 17:43.496
down that road with you,
but look around.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.798
This place was not a target
of opportunity for Kevin.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.834
This was Kevin executing
his plan-- a plan that's

17:47.867 --> 17:50.603
not exactly screaming
jihad to me.
Okay, you might be right,

17:50.637 --> 17:53.473
but my bosses want me to keep
going through our watch list.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.475
(sighs)

17:55.508 --> 17:57.577
So where are you guys
on tracking Kevin Lynch?

17:57.610 --> 18:00.213
We were on our way to his home
when this happened.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.349
I doubt he'd be stupid enough
to go back there,

18:02.382 --> 18:04.251
but we still need to see
what we can find.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.753
Okay. Just keep me apprised.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.224
Hey, Hondo.
Yeah, what'd Reggie say?

18:11.258 --> 18:13.526
He got anyone free to
sweep Kevin's place?
No, he needs

18:13.560 --> 18:15.195
his technicians for
another couple of hours

18:15.228 --> 18:17.230
to sift through the rubble.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.565
Yo, Reggie!

18:19.399 --> 18:22.402
I need you to open up
your toy box for me.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.870
Better not break it.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.139
Let's go.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.708
HONDO: Kevin may have left
this place rigged,

18:28.741 --> 18:30.710
so keep your eyes peeled.
Fan out around the perimeter

18:30.743 --> 18:32.245
in case this place goes up.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.746
Got the tree side!

18:33.780 --> 18:35.248
Who's getting eyes
on that garage?

18:35.282 --> 18:37.250
How about the new guy?

18:37.284 --> 18:38.251
Fine with me.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.586
Go.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.873
No one's home.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.442
All clear.
DEACON: Fall back.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.245
Andros is going in.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.751
STREET:
Where'd you learn
to operate these?

19:11.784 --> 19:14.654
Celtics-Lakers.
2008 Finals.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.889
My unit had to sweep
the Staples Center

19:16.923 --> 19:19.259
for explosives, so...
I got certified.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.202
(creaking)

19:29.236 --> 19:30.470
(door squeaks)

19:34.307 --> 19:36.209
LUCA:
You guys got a visual?
Roger that.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.176
There's something
planted in here.

19:42.882 --> 19:43.850
It's booby-trapped.
The place is gonna go up.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.753
Along with
any evidence.
Stand by. Hold on.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.521
Might be able
to put the fire out.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
Andros must have tripped
this fail-safe.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.777
It's crude,
but it's impressive.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.879
The kid didn't want us
to find anything in here.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.781
Boss?

20:14.814 --> 20:18.017
Found a term paper cowritten
by our first bomber, Adam,

20:18.050 --> 20:19.886
along with Kevin--
do you think this
is something?

20:19.919 --> 20:22.589
Paper for what?
Camden College,
Poli-Sci 433.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.257
It could be, but
I still think

20:24.291 --> 20:25.692
we're missing something.
Keep looking.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.261
Luca. Could we try it
my way now?

20:28.295 --> 20:29.562
(sighs)

20:31.298 --> 20:32.632
All right, that
works, too.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.302
CHRIS:
Guys, listen to this.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.538
"When institutions favor
the haves over the have-nots,

20:38.571 --> 20:40.273
"violence may not just be
an expected outcome,

20:40.307 --> 20:42.375
but a certain one."

20:42.409 --> 20:44.411
Chris, Street,

20:44.444 --> 20:45.578
get down
to Camden College

20:45.612 --> 20:47.680
and see what you can
find. Be quick. Go.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.485
You guys keep digging.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.488
Neither of these young men
was an academic standout.

20:55.522 --> 20:58.425
Although they both got As
in that class you mentioned,

20:58.458 --> 20:59.959
Poli-Sci 433.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.761
I read their paper
on the way over-- intense stuff.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.331
I'm familiar
with the anger in that class.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.300
Students in there made the last
year of my life a nightmare.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.436
They organized a protest
against the renaming

21:09.469 --> 21:10.970
of our business
school.
What was their beef?

21:11.003 --> 21:13.906
Didn't like that a
$50 million donation

21:13.940 --> 21:16.776
was going to create
"more capitalist pigs."

21:16.809 --> 21:18.811
Those protests got
ugly, violent.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.314
Any punishments?
Some suspensions.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.883
Adam and Kevin
got reprimands
on their records.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.852
Of course, the
actual ringleader

21:25.885 --> 21:28.421
suffered no
consequences at all.
Who was the ringleader?

21:28.455 --> 21:30.857
Their professor, Marc Lasky.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.393
Whipped them all up.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.828
What, he didn't get fired?
Our donor's been
all over us

21:35.862 --> 21:38.331
to find a way
to get rid of him,

21:38.365 --> 21:39.599
Lasky's got tenure.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.067
He'd have to
murder someone

21:41.100 --> 21:42.835
for us to
fire him.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.372
Do you know where
we can find Lasky?

21:45.405 --> 21:47.073
He holds office hours
for another 20 minutes.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.841
I can show you where.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.619
After the news broke
about the second bomber,

21:59.652 --> 22:01.588
didn't take an hour for a
brick to get tossed through.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.523
I'm sorry, Tarek.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.792
We're exhausting every angle
we can to find him.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.794
Nobody's seen either
of your guys around the mosques.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.562
The FBI's kicking
people's doors in.

22:09.596 --> 22:13.099
I know they've got a job to do,
but do you really think

22:13.132 --> 22:16.436
these white American boys
are Muslim extremists?

22:16.469 --> 22:18.371
I don't.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.373
Yeah, well,

22:20.407 --> 22:22.575
it'd be nice
to see that on the news, too.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.644
Yeah.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.380
(phone ringing)

22:27.414 --> 22:28.681
I'm really sorry
about your window.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.883
Thanks.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.523
Yeah, Chris, go.
What'd you find?

22:36.556 --> 22:38.458
That class was a staging ground
for some violent protests,

22:38.491 --> 22:39.626
and the professor that taught it

22:39.659 --> 22:40.960
was right in the middle
of it all.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.662
Lasky's supposed to be
at his office

22:42.695 --> 22:44.130
right now,
but it's all locked up.
I'm listening.

22:44.163 --> 22:45.164
The donor who funded
the college's business school

22:45.197 --> 22:47.434
is one of
the board members here,

22:47.467 --> 22:49.402
and apparently he's been
trying hard to get Lasky fired.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.504
Name's, uh, Fred Dwyer.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.506
As in Dwyer Capital?

22:53.540 --> 22:54.541
Looks like it. Why?

22:54.574 --> 22:55.875
The building that got bombed--

22:55.908 --> 22:56.876
Dwyer Capital
rents half the offices

22:56.909 --> 22:58.511
on the second floor.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.713
That business school's
the next target.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.515
Chris, get down there
and start evacuating.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.584
That's Hondo. We have to
get everyone out. Come on.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.185
Get out of the building.
Get out of the building.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.787
Everybody out!
LAPD SWAT, out!

23:07.820 --> 23:09.722
Get in, drop it,

23:09.756 --> 23:10.857
and get out.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.492
I know, Professor. You told me.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.193
Twice, actually.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.529
But that didn't stop you
from phoning in a bomb threat.

23:16.563 --> 23:19.532
Blowing out windows
won't get people to wake up.

23:19.566 --> 23:20.533
I said I'm sorry.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.101
Don't be sorry.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.770
Be strong.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.013
LAPD SWAT, everyone out!
Everyone out! Out! Out!
STREET: Move, move, move, move!

23:34.213 --> 23:36.415
Move! Come on, let's go!

23:36.616 --> 23:39.085
Come on, move, move, move.
Second floor covered?

23:39.118 --> 23:41.053
Every room. Rest of the team
should be here any minute.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.188
LAPD SWAT, everyone out!

23:42.221 --> 23:44.457
Everyone out! Out!

23:44.491 --> 23:46.493
LAPD SWAT, move, move!
Everybody out.
Out, out, out!

23:46.526 --> 23:48.060
Come on, everybody out.
Hey!

23:48.094 --> 23:50.129
You need to evacuate. Hey!

23:50.162 --> 23:53.500
Hey! Do you hear me?

23:53.533 --> 23:54.200
Kevin!

23:56.235 --> 23:57.169
CHRIS:
Eyes on the suspect.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.205
Eyes on Kevin Lynch
in the Dwyer building.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.807
Possible bomb in his backpack.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.808
Kevin!

24:04.243 --> 24:05.645
Get out of the room.
Get out of the building!

24:10.817 --> 24:12.919
Kevin, stop!

24:21.260 --> 24:22.829
All right, nobody move.
LAPD SWAT.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.230
Get down. Everybody out.
(students screaming)

24:24.263 --> 24:26.232
Hey, get back.
Kevin, drop the backpack, buddy.

24:26.265 --> 24:27.233
I need to see
that backpack, okay?

24:27.266 --> 24:28.234
He's got a bomb!

24:28.267 --> 24:29.235
Move out. Everybody out,

24:29.268 --> 24:30.136
everybody out.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.704
Out!
Get out of here

24:31.738 --> 24:33.540
right now!
Put your backpack down.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.508
Let's just keep it calm, okay?
Calm?

24:35.542 --> 24:37.677
As soon as I let go
and these two sides connect,

24:37.710 --> 24:38.578
this entire building

24:38.611 --> 24:40.847
and everybody in it
goes down with me.

24:40.880 --> 24:41.914
You're not gonna do that,
though, are you?

24:41.948 --> 24:44.517
Everyone paying attention,
class? Hey, you! You!

24:44.551 --> 24:45.251
Kevin, you're not
gonna do that.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.252
Sit down!
Down, down.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.054
Anyone else leaves,
everyone dies.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.557
Just keep it calm, okay, buddy?

24:50.590 --> 24:51.423
It's all right.
Kevin...

24:51.457 --> 24:53.259
put the backpack down.
Get out of here.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.261
You want to speed
this process up, hero?

24:55.294 --> 24:56.062
Get out of here.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.296
Okay, we're going.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.297
We're going, okay?
It's all good.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.599
Just keep them apart, okay?

24:59.632 --> 25:00.833
Don't do anything stupid.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.635
Just keep them apart.
We're going.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.636
CHRIS:
Take it easy, Kevin.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.672
Kevin, don't do anything stupid.

25:05.705 --> 25:06.539
Hang tight.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.140
Stay with me, Kevin.
Don't look at me.

25:08.174 --> 25:08.708
Get down. Get your face

25:09.308 --> 25:10.677
to the ground right now.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.054
(tires screech)

25:26.258 --> 25:29.061
CHRIS: We've evacuated everyone
not in the classroom.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.163
Street, did you check
those bathrooms?
Twice. All clear.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.165
Evacuate yourselves
as soon as possible.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.634
You hear me, Chris?
Copy.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.603
Files on all 12 students

25:36.636 --> 25:38.237
trapped in that room.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.910
How far away is the
FBI negotiator?

25:43.943 --> 25:46.946
Agent Conley said
15 minutes out, maybe 20.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.318
Well, looks like we got
a new negotiator, then.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.854
Classroom has an
auditorium-style layout.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.589
It's 15 rows, three sections,
each 20 seats across.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.725
Windows out?
Nope.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.860
Internal windows?
They're on the door,

26:00.893 --> 26:03.763
but it's the size of a
cereal box. Anything?

26:03.796 --> 26:06.032
We need to deactivate
Professor Lasky's badge as...

26:06.065 --> 26:07.700
No. Leave it.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.937
Have them call you
if it pings anywhere on campus.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.739
He says he won't

26:12.772 --> 26:13.906
wear the bomb suit.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.982
You can't go in
without the suit.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.618
There's 12 kids in there

26:25.652 --> 26:27.119
who don't have that option.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.888
I'm gonna do better
talking with him man-to-man,

26:28.921 --> 26:30.723
not looking
like the Pillsbury Doughboy.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.725
Let's wait for
the FBI guy.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.327
I'm certified in negotiations.
You know that.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.030
I've watched Buck talk guys away
from their explosives plenty.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.932
You don't have to
do this, you know.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.301
The only thing I know

26:42.334 --> 26:45.171
is the perfect guy to disarm
this kid is sitting on his ass

26:45.204 --> 26:46.839
in Northridge
because you fired him

26:46.873 --> 26:49.108
without giving him a chance
to defend himself.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.977
What has Buck
got to do with this?
He's who we need here today,

26:51.010 --> 26:53.045
but we don't have him
because of you.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.314
You could've just suspended him,
but no, you fired him

26:55.347 --> 26:56.749
because you wanted to do
what's good for you,

26:56.783 --> 26:58.184
not what's good for the city.
No, hold on.

26:58.217 --> 27:01.187
Otherwise, we wouldn't be
in this position right now.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.989
You done?

27:04.023 --> 27:05.725
You think I enjoyed

27:05.758 --> 27:07.059
watching his career end
like that?

27:07.093 --> 27:08.995
I begged him to fight it.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.330
Buck insisted that I fire him.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.199
He had shot an
unarmed black kid

27:13.232 --> 27:15.067
who looked like he
was about to die.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.970
Buck knew the city
was about to explode.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.272
He didn't want to make it harder
on the rest of us.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.141
It was Buck's call.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.443
Not mine.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.212
(chuckles softly)

27:26.245 --> 27:27.747
I know you don't respect me.

27:27.780 --> 27:28.948
I never said that.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.883
Never had to.

27:30.917 --> 27:32.985
But if you ever say

27:33.019 --> 27:34.854
that I don't care
about this city

27:34.887 --> 27:36.856
or the officers who
work for me again,

27:36.889 --> 27:40.026
you and I are gonna mix it up.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.097
Lasky's access badge just pinged

27:45.131 --> 27:46.098
at the faculty
parking structure.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.466
You and Luca. Go.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.836
Hondo, you be careful.

27:49.869 --> 27:53.272
You might just get that
promotion after all, Deacon.

27:53.305 --> 27:56.943
Yeah. Hope not.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.931
STREET:
Come on, let's go, let's go.

28:18.965 --> 28:21.000
Move, move, move. Move,
move, move, move, move, move.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.903
These are the
last of the kids.
Hostages' positions?

28:23.936 --> 28:25.271
Behind their seats in
the first three rows.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.273
And where's Kevin?
11 o'clock
when you first

28:27.306 --> 28:29.141
enter the room. But he's pacing
around, muttering.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.143
Something's really off
with him, Hondo.
Yeah, no kidding.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.845
All right, both of you, get the
hell away from this building.

28:32.879 --> 28:33.712
All right.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.171
LAPD SWAT. Get out
of the building. Go.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.516
KEVIN:
Hey.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.819
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
Get out of here!

29:12.852 --> 29:16.188
I-I will. I will. Once I know

29:16.222 --> 29:18.324
everyone in here is safe.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.159
I'm Hondo.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.894
Cool to call you Kevin?

29:21.928 --> 29:24.063
KEVIN: Yeah, that-that's
what everyone calls me.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.198
What the hell do you want?

29:26.232 --> 29:28.935
I want to know what you want.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.203
Kevin, I need you
to listen to me.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.239
You have a student in here.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.041
Her name is Maria Quinn.
She's a diabetic.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.209
She really needs to get
to her medicine, Kevin.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.477
Jesus.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.013
Okay, hey. Hey, how about this?

29:41.047 --> 29:43.415
You let Maria go,

29:43.449 --> 29:46.352
and I'll take her place,
and you and me, we can talk.
(laughs) Oh, yeah.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.153
Yeah,
that's what you want to do.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.288
You ju...
y-you just want to talk.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.924
Yeah, well,
I don't feel like listening.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.392
I just want to make sure
we all stay safe, Kevin.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.095
Oh, "we"?
That's right.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.264
Look around.

29:58.297 --> 30:01.067
We're all in this together.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.571
Which one of you is Maria?

30:05.604 --> 30:09.041
Me.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.110
I-I'm Maria.
Kevin.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.212
Look at her.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.214
She's sick.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.249
She needs her medicine.

30:17.283 --> 30:20.519
Just let her go.
Oh, God.

30:20.552 --> 30:21.553
Okay? Just her.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.126
Okay.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.261
Come on, Maria.
Come on.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.529
Get outside. Go.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.002
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.269
Where...
What the hell are you doing?

30:37.303 --> 30:39.872
I'm keeping my promise.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.209
I said her for me.

30:48.981 --> 30:52.451
As soon as I drop this thing,
we're all dead.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.386
(students whimper)

30:55.421 --> 30:57.223
So go ahead and shoot me
if you want.

30:57.256 --> 30:58.524
HONDO:
No.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.026
No, I'm not gonna do that.

31:02.128 --> 31:03.629
I'm not gonna shoot you, Kevin.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.865
I'll put it away.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.951
I want to help you
end this peacefully.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.152
Yeah, well, this doesn't

31:26.185 --> 31:29.188
end peacefully, okay?
Why not?

31:29.221 --> 31:32.224
I mean,
it has to be really important

31:32.258 --> 31:33.960
that you're willing
to hurt all these people.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.661
Kevin, these
are just kids.

31:35.694 --> 31:38.430
You don't even know them.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.698
Yeah, well,
would I rather take down

31:39.731 --> 31:41.667
a room full of billionaires?
Sure.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.003
But trust fund babies studying

31:44.036 --> 31:45.972
to become those billionaires?

31:46.005 --> 31:47.306
Well, that's
the next best thing.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.009
These kids?
They're your problem?

31:50.042 --> 31:53.479
(scoffs) They're not my problem.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.281
Monopolized wealth
is my problem.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.384
The one percent

31:58.417 --> 31:59.952
is my problem.

31:59.986 --> 32:03.022
Greed is my problem!

32:03.055 --> 32:04.290
I mean, look at this.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.724
I mean, just step outside.
(students whimper)

32:05.757 --> 32:07.559
The world is burning down

32:07.593 --> 32:09.061
and nobody cares!

32:10.562 --> 32:14.000
Oh, and these criminals
at the top, they think

32:14.033 --> 32:15.001
they're gonna get away with it.

32:15.034 --> 32:19.538
Why? Because they always
get away with it. Right?

32:19.571 --> 32:21.207
Well, not this time.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.975
'Cause we're gonna
wake people up.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.143
(students whimpering)

32:24.176 --> 32:25.444
KEVIN:
We're gonna show them

32:25.477 --> 32:27.646
that the whole system is rigged.

32:27.679 --> 32:31.217
Okay, I get your goals. I do.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.053
But violence
is the solution?

32:34.086 --> 32:36.755
Explain that to me.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.158
Uh, it commands
people's attention

32:39.191 --> 32:40.426
when nothing else works.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.628
I mean, come on.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.264
You're a cop.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.133
Man, you must see injustice
every day.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.601
The powerful
abusing the weak.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.271
The rich riding the backs
of the poor.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.007
Man, there's people born on
the wrong side of the tracks

32:55.041 --> 32:57.309
and then they're blamed
for living there?!

32:57.343 --> 32:58.410
You don't have to tell me
about being born

32:58.444 --> 32:59.645
on the wrong side of the tracks,
Kevin,

32:59.678 --> 33:01.147
because I still live there.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.449
But most people
work hard

33:03.482 --> 33:05.217
and they do
their best

33:05.251 --> 33:07.686
to climb a notch, just so,
one day, God willing,

33:07.719 --> 33:10.022
they can sit on a porch
somewhere and just enjoy it.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.160
That's all these kids want.

33:16.128 --> 33:19.298
And I got to believe
that's all you want.

33:23.269 --> 33:24.703
Isn't it?

33:27.839 --> 33:31.343
(phone ringing)
(gasping)

33:31.377 --> 33:35.347
Yeah, Professor, man,
uh, where the hell are you,

33:35.381 --> 33:38.617
you know? You-you
kind of left me here all alone.

33:38.650 --> 33:39.685
LASKY:
Kevin,

33:39.718 --> 33:41.287
we're in this together.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.021
We're almost there.

33:48.394 --> 33:51.730
Our negotiator's outside.
Too late.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.566
Now, listen to me. Listen.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.103
I am so, so proud
of what you're about to do.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.537
HONDO:
No, don't listen to him, Kevin.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.107
He's the one who's pissed
off at this college.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.309
Ask him why he isn't standing
here instead of you.

34:03.342 --> 34:04.710
Who is that?

34:04.743 --> 34:06.478
He doesn't know you.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.080
He doesn't know
what it's like to sacrifice

34:08.114 --> 34:08.814
for something greater
than himself.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.450
The price that we've paid.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.152
Come on, Kevin,
he's playing you.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.786
You're the one
who's paying that price.

34:14.820 --> 34:15.854
Don't listen to him.

34:15.887 --> 34:16.788
You can't trust him

34:16.822 --> 34:18.224
the way you can trust me.

34:18.257 --> 34:19.125
Kevin, look at these kids.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.361
Where's Lauren?

34:22.394 --> 34:23.829
Lauren Moss, where are you?

34:23.862 --> 34:26.498
(sniffles)
I'm-I'm Lauren.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.167
Lauren, you're not some
trust fund kid, are you?

34:30.202 --> 34:31.870
Tell Kevin
why you enrolled here.

34:31.903 --> 34:35.874
My mom's restaurant, it
gives her all the bad shifts.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.844
And so I thought maybe I could
help her buy the place one day.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.580
Kevin, we agreed.

34:41.613 --> 34:44.183
We agreed to change the world
together.

34:44.216 --> 34:45.584
Remember, Kevin?

34:45.617 --> 34:47.586
Hey, Paul. Paul. Where's Paul?

34:47.619 --> 34:49.588
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Could you just, please...

34:49.621 --> 34:50.556
Okay.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.391
Just-just back up, okay?

34:52.424 --> 34:53.425
Kevin, I want you
to listen to Paul.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.396
Your parents pay for college?

34:57.429 --> 34:59.798
No, they, uh...
they didn't go to college.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.200
They wanted

35:01.233 --> 35:02.134
to help, but they can't.

35:03.902 --> 35:06.505
Kevin, finish what we started.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.340
Get people to rise up.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.476
You can change the world.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.178
Yeah, man, but, uh,

35:12.211 --> 35:13.845
you know, there-there's
a bunch of students

35:13.879 --> 35:15.547
in here.
LASKY: Yes.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.883
Studying to control the rest
of us with their money!

35:17.916 --> 35:20.752
Now,

35:20.786 --> 35:23.355
let go of the clamp, Kevin.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.524
Be a hero.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.626
Professor! I'm
gonna need you to put

35:27.659 --> 35:29.628
that phone down.

35:29.661 --> 35:30.629
Don't do it, Kevin. Don't...

35:30.662 --> 35:31.763
Hey, shut up!
(whimpering)

35:31.797 --> 35:33.699
You shut up and back up!

35:33.732 --> 35:36.568
Right now! All right?!

35:36.602 --> 35:38.437
I am trying to think!
Can you let me think?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.172
Do it. Do it

35:40.206 --> 35:41.773
for a better world.
Come on down.

35:41.807 --> 35:45.311
Come on down. You'll be brought
in nice and peacefully.

35:45.344 --> 35:48.347
(chuckles)
Your word means nothing to me.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.748
I'm all talked out.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.819
(grunting)

35:56.555 --> 35:58.224
No, you don't get
the easy way out.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.960
(exhales)
Hondo,

36:01.993 --> 36:03.795
the threat's been neutralized.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.565
Professor.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.200
(Kevin sniffles)

36:08.234 --> 36:10.402
Professor?

36:10.436 --> 36:13.272
He was never there, Kevin.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.706
Not really.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.842
I know
that's hard for you to hear.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.877
No.

36:18.910 --> 36:22.914
No, you don't know me at all,
man.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.319
What are you doing?

36:28.987 --> 36:31.323
I know no one in
that office building died today.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.527
Because you called in
a bomb threat.

36:35.561 --> 36:38.964
Kevin, you saved lives--
you didn't take 'em.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.533
Yeah, 'cause,
you know, I just...

36:41.567 --> 36:43.569
(shuddering breath)

36:43.602 --> 36:46.238
You know, I just...
I just want to matter.

36:46.272 --> 36:48.674
I just want things
to get better.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.742
I mean, that-that's why
we built this thing.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.878
Adam, he found
the instructions online,

36:52.911 --> 36:55.914
and I helped him because
I wanted to make things better.

36:57.916 --> 37:00.919
I-Isn't it better

37:00.952 --> 37:04.523
to die for something
than to ignore reality?

37:04.556 --> 37:07.259
No. No, Kevin.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.895
It's better
to live for something.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.334
You got humanity in you.
I can see it.

37:15.367 --> 37:18.437
(exhales, chuckles)

37:18.470 --> 37:20.272
And I know you see the humanity
in these kids.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.481
Look at 'em.

37:29.515 --> 37:31.683
Look at 'em.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.291
Nobody has to die today.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.859
(panting)

37:40.892 --> 37:43.629
That's not
who you are.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.465
That's not who you are, Kevin.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.400
Come on, now.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.868
(stammers, panting)

37:49.901 --> 37:53.572
Just hand that
over to me.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.608
Move that clamp over to me
nice and slow.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.811
Okay?

37:59.845 --> 38:01.947
Slow.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.957
(panting)
(gasping, sobbing)

38:11.990 --> 38:14.025
KEVIN:
I'm-I'm so sorry.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.594
I'm-I'm sorry.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.563
I'm so sorry. I'm...
Everybody out!

38:17.596 --> 38:19.097
Get out. Move.
Go outside!

38:19.130 --> 38:21.700
Let's go! Outside!

38:21.733 --> 38:23.735
Send in the bomb techs.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.036
Send 'em in!
All right!

38:25.070 --> 38:27.773
Go! Go!

38:32.511 --> 38:35.347
(exhales)

38:35.381 --> 38:37.015
*

38:53.532 --> 38:54.466
(exhales)

38:56.134 --> 38:57.869
*

39:17.423 --> 39:18.590
(grunting)
Good. Double punch left.

39:18.624 --> 39:20.659
(grunting)
Good.

39:30.636 --> 39:32.504
LUCA: Yo, Hondo.
Want to get in

39:32.538 --> 39:33.905
on a workout?

39:33.939 --> 39:36.542
Nah, rain check, Luca.
Aw, come on.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.977
Adrenaline's pumping!
Nah, nah, nah.
I'm beat.

39:39.010 --> 39:39.778
Go easy on him, Chris.
(chuckles)

39:39.811 --> 39:41.547
No chance.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.514
Let's go!

39:42.548 --> 39:43.715
Double.

39:43.749 --> 39:46.117
Hey, Street.
Hi, boss.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.053
Actually, come here
for a second.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.388
I want to talk to you.
What's up?

39:51.957 --> 39:53.959
I been thinking a lot
about Buck,

39:53.992 --> 39:55.927
what happened to him.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.730
Yeah, you think we should take
him for a beer or something?

39:58.764 --> 40:01.767
I can call him.
No. No, no, no.
I think it's better for us

40:01.800 --> 40:03.769
and better for him if we just
give him some space for a while.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.773
Okay.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.441
Your call.

40:10.809 --> 40:14.780
(exhales)
Street, uh...

40:14.813 --> 40:18.584
don't you ever forget who
your locker once belonged to,

40:18.617 --> 40:20.919
the reason
that you are SWAT

40:20.952 --> 40:23.722
and whose legacy you carry.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.593
I promise.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.895
Night, boss.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.463
Good night.

40:31.497 --> 40:32.030
Night, guys.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.437
*

40:47.513 --> 40:50.148
(sighs)

40:50.181 --> 40:52.484
(footsteps approaching)

41:00.659 --> 41:03.629
Everything okay?

41:03.662 --> 41:06.197
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

41:06.231 --> 41:07.999
*

41:20.812 --> 41:23.815
I was just coming by to check on
next week's schedule, but, um...

41:23.849 --> 41:26.084
unless you got something
on your mind...

41:26.117 --> 41:29.120
No. Just, um...

41:30.589 --> 41:33.058
I never realized it before.

41:33.091 --> 41:34.960
It's tough to be a cop.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.162
But sometimes it's tougher to...

41:38.664 --> 41:39.998
Tougher to what?

41:43.001 --> 41:45.003
Nothing.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.941
*

41:52.343 --> 41:54.580
Have a good night.

41:57.082 --> 41:59.250
You, too.
