WEBVTT

00:03.942 --> 00:07.153
NORMAN'S CONQUEST

00:08.238 --> 00:11.700
You got the next round ready
for the ladies in the back room?

00:11.867 --> 00:14.744
- Almost.
- Aren't they a cute group?

00:14.911 --> 00:17.455
The Golden 80s Club.

00:17.622 --> 00:20.959
A bunch of old widows
and spinsters get together

00:21.126 --> 00:24.547
and play connect the liver spots.

00:24.714 --> 00:29.176
I agree with Diane, Carla.
They're absolutely adorable.

00:29.343 --> 00:33.264
- You like anybody who calls you sonny.
- Yeah.

00:33.431 --> 00:35.474
All set, Diane.

00:35.641 --> 00:38.978
This is quite a load. I'll take two trips.

00:39.145 --> 00:43.649
Yes. There is
a non-professionaI for you.

00:43.816 --> 00:46.944
Last round, I got them all in one trip.

00:53.534 --> 00:57.371
- One more beer.
- Like me to carry it for you?

00:57.580 --> 00:59.957
No. No problem.

01:00.166 --> 01:05.713
I'll simply do as the noble women
of primitive tribaI cultures do -

01:05.880 --> 01:08.424
I'll balance it on my noodle.

01:13.763 --> 01:17.768
Those sweet little old ladies
are gonna love this!

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:32.074 --> 01:36.495
- Look! It's Lawrence Welk!
- No! Stop!

02:57.077 --> 03:00.289
- And you're wrong.
- In your hat.

03:00.455 --> 03:03.458
I've lost track, Carla. What round is this?

03:03.625 --> 03:05.669
I can't count that high.

03:05.836 --> 03:09.381
So we can follow the fun,
what's this fight about?

03:09.548 --> 03:15.721
We're not fighting. We're discussing a
difference of opinion. Vodka rocks, two.

03:15.929 --> 03:21.351
I think Sam is a heartless, mindless,
slack-jawed cretin and he disagrees.

03:21.518 --> 03:25.981
He'll see reason eventually.
Let me know when his head lights up.

03:26.148 --> 03:29.818
You take
a connecting flight to get to the point.

03:32.362 --> 03:37.159
We were talking about the way
you don't trust me, motormouth.

03:37.367 --> 03:44.167
No, broken brow, we settled that. You
were proven wrong and we moved on.

03:44.334 --> 03:51.007
Credit me with enough intelligence to
humiliate you in the right subject area.

03:51.174 --> 03:54.594
My favourite couple.
Steve and Eydie Amin.

03:56.929 --> 04:00.016
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

04:02.185 --> 04:08.274
- Normie, could this be Vera?
- With expensive surgery, maybe.

04:12.278 --> 04:16.531
This is Emily Phillips and she runs
a boutique downtown.

04:16.699 --> 04:19.535
I've just taken them on as a client.

04:22.664 --> 04:26.250
Why are they so excited?
You said you had lots of clients.

04:26.417 --> 04:30.797
They're naturally happy people.
They sing the live-long day.

04:33.175 --> 04:36.345
Hi. Welcome to Cheers.
I'm Sam Malone.

04:37.221 --> 04:41.850
- What kind of boutique is it?
- A dress shop, struggling to survive.

04:42.017 --> 04:45.437
Thanks to Norm,
I'll get a healthy tax return.

04:45.604 --> 04:51.693
I did a few simple things. She wasn't
writing off her cockroaches as livestock.

04:55.322 --> 05:01.120
I'm so proud of us. Women have taken
our place in society as never before.

05:01.286 --> 05:04.957
Working, doing,
rising on merit through the ranks.

05:05.124 --> 05:09.670
We are taking our place alongside of
and in many cases above men.

05:09.837 --> 05:16.009
- Once exploited, now we are equaI.
- Shake it up! I'm dry over here!

05:16.218 --> 05:18.345
Excuse me.

05:20.556 --> 05:23.184
Pardon me. I gotta call the shop.

05:23.393 --> 05:25.854
I really like this Cheers place.

05:26.062 --> 05:28.731
- Do you come here often?
- What's often?

05:28.898 --> 05:33.653
- Two or three times a week.
- Then I don't come here often.

05:33.820 --> 05:37.574
- Can I have a beer?
- You told her you have a lot of clients?

05:37.782 --> 05:42.912
75. 200 would be stretching it for
someone working out of his car.

05:44.747 --> 05:49.460
What's going on?
You seem kind of friendly.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.966
She brought me in to celebrate
the outstanding work I did.

05:55.133 --> 05:59.554
I don't know. I sense something
between the two of you.

05:59.721 --> 06:03.141
The temperature rose
when you two walked in.

06:03.349 --> 06:08.980
You're her new accountant.
Have you gone over her figure?

06:09.147 --> 06:11.859
Does she have sizeable assets?

06:12.902 --> 06:17.781
Is she showing you capitaI gains
to make you liquidate your holdings?

06:20.201 --> 06:24.205
It's all very well to be witty,
but you don't understand.

06:24.371 --> 06:29.335
She's just a nice lady and she
wanted to show me her appreciation.

06:29.501 --> 06:31.545
That's what you think.

06:31.712 --> 06:35.633
Haven't you noticed the looks
she's shooting at you?

06:35.841 --> 06:40.095
Like you're a juicy steak,
soon to be sizzling on a grill.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.223
Here she comes.

06:43.390 --> 06:46.894
- Where do you want to sit?
- That table's fine.

06:47.061 --> 06:51.106
- What can I get you?
- Whatever you have will be fine.

06:53.734 --> 06:56.487
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

06:56.654 --> 07:00.909
Let's submit this to our resident expert
on womenology.

07:01.076 --> 07:04.746
Well, I don't usually think of myself
that way, but...

07:05.830 --> 07:08.708
I'd be happy to share my thoughts.

07:08.875 --> 07:11.419
What do you think, Sam?

07:12.379 --> 07:17.842
- I think she's scouting your territory.
- Norman, ignore these blatherskites.

07:19.219 --> 07:23.348
- They're having fun at your expense.
- She's right.

07:23.515 --> 07:28.478
The emptiness of their lives causes
them to cast aspersions on yours.

07:30.772 --> 07:33.608
- You can say that again.
- No, I can't.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.490
I know these guys are joking.

07:40.657 --> 07:46.746
They know that if anything did happen
it would injure the speciaI one you love.

07:46.913 --> 07:50.000
I'd get over it in a couple of weeks.

07:53.212 --> 07:57.842
Look at the way she's looking at you.
She is hot for your bod.

08:00.553 --> 08:02.930
- There you go.
- There you are.

08:03.139 --> 08:05.975
I've been getting lonely.

08:06.142 --> 08:08.769
Would you excuse me just one moment,
please?

08:10.187 --> 08:13.441
You're right. The woman's a she deviI.

08:14.608 --> 08:17.653
- What shall I do?
- The course is clear.

08:17.820 --> 08:22.575
You act like the man you are
and submit to her every demand.

08:22.741 --> 08:28.122
Thank you. Can I have an opinion from
someone who's had a date this century?

08:28.289 --> 08:31.375
You told her you were married, right?

08:31.542 --> 08:35.880
Course. She knows about Vera.
I mentioned her a few times.

08:36.046 --> 08:42.053
My wedding ring's there for everyone to
see, at a pawn shop on Boylson Street.

08:42.220 --> 08:48.226
You see? You're always making these
crass, adolescent jokes about Vera.

08:48.393 --> 08:54.191
This woman takes you seriously. She
thinks you don't care about your wife.

08:54.357 --> 08:58.987
- Don't listen to her. Go for it.
- Be a man, Norm.

08:59.154 --> 09:02.657
You are recommending
Norman commit adultery.

09:02.866 --> 09:07.746
It happens all the time, stick.
That's the way life is.

09:09.164 --> 09:15.921
The difference between "Dynasty" and
the reaI world is they got better hair cuts.

09:16.087 --> 09:18.548
What do you think, Sam?

09:19.841 --> 09:25.305
I think it's stupid to jump into bed
with somebody you're working with.

09:29.101 --> 09:33.272
I didn't mean stupid
in the unintelligent sense.

09:34.357 --> 09:39.070
Sam's depressed. This is the year
his age caught up with his IQ.

09:42.156 --> 09:44.867
That's years away.

09:46.452 --> 09:51.749
- Norm, do you find her attractive?
- Of course. She's very attractive.

09:51.916 --> 09:54.961
If it was me she was attracted to,

09:55.127 --> 09:59.215
I wouldn't be hanging around a bar
talking to jerks.

09:59.382 --> 10:03.219
Yeah, Norm. Do something. Come on.

10:03.427 --> 10:07.848
- Is anything wrong, Norm?
- He's gonna take care of you.

10:09.642 --> 10:12.687
- Just a sec, Emily.
- Norm. Look.

10:12.853 --> 10:17.066
If you're scared, I'll take charge.
With me it won't be sinfuI.

10:17.233 --> 10:19.695
Just unsightly.

10:19.861 --> 10:23.865
If you're interested,
strike while the iron is hot.

10:29.913 --> 10:32.582
Norman, will you do me a favour?

10:32.749 --> 10:34.793
- What?
- Call Vera.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.088
- Why?
- Just call her and listen to her voice

10:38.255 --> 10:42.384
before you rend asunder the inviolate
garment of your marriage.

10:42.551 --> 10:45.011
Diane, please.

10:45.220 --> 10:48.890
- Are you afraid?
- Afraid to talk to my own wife?

10:55.188 --> 10:59.109
Emily, I'll be with you in a minute.
Quick business call here.

11:00.318 --> 11:03.989
Hello, Vera, it's Norm.
I'm at Cheers. It's 8:05.

11:04.156 --> 11:07.493
You need me, you've got
the number here. Bye.

11:07.660 --> 11:12.623
- You have an answering machine?
- No, that was Vera.

11:15.293 --> 11:19.338
I think you'd better give
the lady what she wants.

11:19.505 --> 11:24.719
If you don't come across, she's going to
drop you like a bad habit.

11:24.886 --> 11:28.306
Norman, has it come to this?

11:28.473 --> 11:33.853
Are you going to sell your virtue to
the first person who buys you a drink?

11:34.020 --> 11:36.856
If you were a woman,
we'd have a name for you.

11:37.023 --> 11:40.151
I kind of like Becky.

11:43.196 --> 11:47.700
I realise Norma is closer.
You just have to add U-H, but...

11:49.702 --> 11:55.291
Could everybody back off? Is my private
life a subject of public debate?

11:55.458 --> 11:58.086
- You backing out?
- Guys, lay off.

11:58.253 --> 12:02.174
OK, Sam.
Norm, we were just kidding with you.

12:02.341 --> 12:05.719
- We knew you wouldn't do it.
- We know what kind of guy he is.

12:05.886 --> 12:08.847
We know he wouldn't cheat on Vera.

12:09.014 --> 12:14.520
All right. Norm, look. We'll even sing
your wedding song for you.

12:17.773 --> 12:19.483
Yes, dear.

12:20.901 --> 12:22.903
Of course.

12:23.946 --> 12:26.073
Right away.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.701
You think
I'm the heavyweight champion wuss.

12:29.868 --> 12:32.496
Unchallenged.

12:34.331 --> 12:40.170
Stand back and eat my dust.
Stormin' Norman is primed for love.

12:41.171 --> 12:44.049
You better hurry up.
She's on her way out.

12:45.092 --> 12:47.971
Hey, Emily. Wait up.

12:48.137 --> 12:50.014
Are you trying to ditch me?

12:50.181 --> 12:54.769
It's obvious you'd rather be
with your friends. I'm in the way.

12:54.936 --> 13:00.066
That was rude. I'm sorry.
I'd like to make it up to you.

13:00.275 --> 13:03.611
- It's OK.
- Please. Let me buy you dinner.

13:05.238 --> 13:10.868
That might be nice. But I don't feeI like
being around people any more.

13:11.035 --> 13:13.037
Me neither.

13:14.080 --> 13:19.085
I guess I could fix a little something
over at my place.

13:20.878 --> 13:23.589
Sounds good.

13:32.390 --> 13:35.268
You don't have to go through with this.

13:35.435 --> 13:41.233
Have there been any innovations in
women's undergarments since 1965?

13:59.469 --> 14:02.013
I'm so disappointed in Norman.

14:04.391 --> 14:09.354
Your problem is a lack of understanding
of the male of the species.

14:09.521 --> 14:12.065
Man was not made to be monogamous.

14:12.232 --> 14:16.862
It's an artificiaI phenomenon
imposed from without.

14:17.028 --> 14:19.990
The male can never
have enough women.

14:20.157 --> 14:23.493
Or in your case, any.

14:27.999 --> 14:33.212
Don't be too hard on Norm.
He's inexperienced. He got swept away.

14:33.421 --> 14:39.844
It makes me almost gratefuI the amount
of experience you've had with women.

14:42.430 --> 14:49.103
I think by now your curiosity is satisfied,
your inexplicable lusts sated.

14:49.270 --> 14:53.274
If our relationship remains
as strong as it is now

14:53.441 --> 14:57.737
you'll have no need for sexuaI
experience with another woman.

14:57.904 --> 15:00.198
Oh, my God.

15:02.074 --> 15:04.619
What do you mean, "Oh, my God?"

15:04.827 --> 15:10.750
I just never thought about that before.
My last woman.

15:11.876 --> 15:15.422
- You do agree, don't you?
- I don't know.

15:15.589 --> 15:18.967
- Why not?
- Come on.

15:19.134 --> 15:25.474
Something could happen to you.
You could die or go insane or...

15:25.641 --> 15:28.352
What happens if you don't age well?

15:28.518 --> 15:32.898
What would happen if I went down
in an aeroplane over South America

15:33.065 --> 15:36.818
and was taken captive
by a tribe of huge women...

15:39.154 --> 15:42.407
...who made me their sex slave.

15:42.574 --> 15:46.578
Forced by High Priestess Bettina
and her handmaidens

15:46.745 --> 15:51.291
to satisfy them day after day after day.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.546
Come on. Be realistic, Diane.

15:59.049 --> 16:04.764
I thought of something. What if Vera
calls wanting to know where Normie is?

16:04.931 --> 16:09.727
- Tell her he stepped out.
- That's kind of flimsy.

16:09.894 --> 16:12.563
OK. He went to a movie with you.

16:12.730 --> 16:18.069
That's nice. Norm and I haven't
been out together in a long time.

16:20.655 --> 16:23.950
Mrs Peterson, Norm's out with a dame.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.494
Give me that!

16:26.703 --> 16:31.457
Coach, if you were at the Alamo,
we'd all be wearing sombreros.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.711
What? Emily who?

16:36.087 --> 16:38.756
Yeah. Norm's dame.

16:40.133 --> 16:45.096
Of course he isn't here.
I thought he was pitching woo with you.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.433
You're kidding.

16:48.599 --> 16:51.352
Oh, man. It figures.

16:52.395 --> 16:54.481
I'll tell him to call you.

16:54.648 --> 16:57.192
- What?
- We should have known.

16:57.401 --> 17:00.779
- Norm chickened out.
- Come on!

17:00.946 --> 17:05.951
- What happened?
- He dropped her off and went to park.

17:06.117 --> 17:10.122
That was two hours ago
and she hasn't seen him since.

17:10.289 --> 17:13.709
If he has any pride, he's killed himself.

17:13.876 --> 17:18.172
- He just came to his senses.
- He came to his knees.

17:18.338 --> 17:22.092
He did the decent,
honourable and moraI thing.

17:22.259 --> 17:25.012
We'll make him pay the rest of his life.

17:25.179 --> 17:30.100
Quiet! Here he comes.
Just act like you don't know anything.

17:30.267 --> 17:33.854
Something tells me
you boys can handle that.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.777
She's an animaI.

17:42.947 --> 17:45.658
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

17:49.496 --> 17:51.539
I'm spent.

17:52.707 --> 17:55.251
Give me a beer, Coach.

17:57.337 --> 18:03.259
- She couldn't get enough of you?
- I had to climb out the fire escape.

18:03.426 --> 18:08.556
You got to give us all the details, Norm.
And I mean details.

18:08.765 --> 18:11.935
- Is everybody over 21?
- Don't do this.

18:12.101 --> 18:15.063
- Shut up and let the man talk.
- Come on.

18:15.230 --> 18:18.483
I think this just about says it all.

18:18.650 --> 18:21.110
Major hickey!

18:22.820 --> 18:26.324
It's the only one I can show
in mixed company.

18:26.491 --> 18:32.748
Norm, I hate to see you make a fooI
of yourself, but Emily called.

18:33.958 --> 18:37.211
She wants more?
That woman is insatiable!

18:37.378 --> 18:41.548
She wanted to know where you were.
You didn't show up.

18:41.715 --> 18:44.343
And everybody here knows it.

18:45.719 --> 18:49.640
Of course.
Do you expect her to brag about it?

18:49.807 --> 18:52.518
Only a crass lowlife would do that.

18:54.270 --> 18:57.273
Let's go and talk in the pooI room.

18:57.439 --> 19:01.110
Big guy wants some pointers now!
I'll fill you in.

19:02.611 --> 19:07.408
What a pathetic display.
I'm ashamed God made me a man.

19:07.574 --> 19:10.995
I don't think God's bragging either.

19:12.871 --> 19:18.335
I didn't even have the guts to go in.
I've been in the car for two hours.

19:20.337 --> 19:22.632
What about your hickey?

19:22.799 --> 19:26.970
I've got a vacuum cleaner
in the glove compartment.

19:27.137 --> 19:29.305
I'm such a coward!

19:29.472 --> 19:36.396
Come on, Norm. Meaningless affairs
aren't all they're cracked up to be.

19:36.563 --> 19:39.441
- Did they make me happy?
- Ecstatic.

19:39.607 --> 19:41.693
Yeah, but that's me.

19:43.695 --> 19:48.450
- You're a different kind of man.
- You're telling me.

19:50.201 --> 19:53.955
Sammy, can I make
a confession to you right now?

19:54.164 --> 19:56.082
Please don't.

19:58.835 --> 20:01.296
I love my wife.

20:01.504 --> 20:04.883
- That's not as bad as I thought.
- It gets worse.

20:05.049 --> 20:09.512
- Oh, God.
- Vera is the only woman I've ever had.

20:09.679 --> 20:14.268
When you say "had", you mean...

20:14.435 --> 20:17.480
- Yes.
- Come on, man. Be serious.

20:17.646 --> 20:20.399
- I am.
- What's wrong with that?

20:23.694 --> 20:26.405
I don't even want other women, Sam.

20:27.656 --> 20:30.117
Don't get me wrong. I get urges.

20:30.326 --> 20:34.163
If I acted on them,
I'd be no better than a rutting pig.

20:34.371 --> 20:37.666
A happy, singing, dancing, rutting pig.

20:41.545 --> 20:46.926
What was this about? You make it
sound like you're confessing a crime.

20:47.092 --> 20:50.679
People don't brag
about loving their wives.

20:50.846 --> 20:53.599
Have you seen guys slamming beers

20:53.766 --> 20:57.311
and exchanging great tales
of maritaI bliss?

20:58.437 --> 21:03.485
So those jokes about Vera are a bunch
of baloney. You really love her?

21:03.652 --> 21:07.697
Course I do.
Most of them aren't even true.

21:07.864 --> 21:11.493
Like that one about the tentacles.

21:14.788 --> 21:19.334
I can only speak for myself,
but I think that's wonderfuI.

21:20.418 --> 21:24.589
You may not believe me, but I envy you.

21:24.756 --> 21:26.800
- You envy me?
- Yeah.

21:26.967 --> 21:32.264
I used to think that the more women
I conquered, the more I'd be a man.

21:32.430 --> 21:36.101
And now I'm just looking for the right one.

21:36.268 --> 21:38.395
Now you've found Diane.

21:38.561 --> 21:41.022
When they made her
they broke the mould.

21:41.189 --> 21:44.109
And tried to pretend it was an accident.

21:44.276 --> 21:48.029
You're doing it, too! And you know why?

21:48.238 --> 21:53.452
Because you're a guy. Deep down,
we're terrified of being wusses.

21:53.619 --> 21:57.790
Someone's got to pay for that.
Might as well be women.

21:59.917 --> 22:04.797
I'm sorry, but I couldn't help
overhearing what you just said.

22:05.006 --> 22:08.592
- How much?
- Everything.

22:08.759 --> 22:12.263
I discovered,
if you go into the women's room,

22:12.430 --> 22:17.393
wet your ear and jam it against the wall,
you hear the occasionaI word.

22:17.601 --> 22:23.190
Just be glad I did. Listen to me. I have
something to say to you. I can help you.

22:23.357 --> 22:25.484
I want to say it to your face.

22:25.651 --> 22:29.739
- You are a ladies' man.
- I am?

22:29.905 --> 22:35.202
Yes. You're a one-woman man and
every woman loves and respects that.

22:35.369 --> 22:41.543
Don't live your life in deference
to what some beer-swilling swine think.

22:41.710 --> 22:44.171
Gee, I always have.

22:45.297 --> 22:51.261
Norman, they're unhappy
with their marriages or lack thereof.

22:51.428 --> 22:57.768
They're waiting for you to throw yours
away and lower yourself to their leveI.

22:57.934 --> 23:02.939
- I hate them. God, I hate them.
- Me too.

23:03.106 --> 23:05.358
It's time I faced up to it.

23:05.525 --> 23:08.570
My marriage is
my most prized possession

23:08.737 --> 23:12.199
and next to my Honda Civic,
my only possession.

23:12.365 --> 23:15.243
I love my wife. I don't care who knows.

23:15.410 --> 23:20.165
- Hey, you guys! Listen up out here.
- You're a wimp!

23:20.332 --> 23:24.795
I love my wife. I'm not about to throw
away 11 years of marriage.

23:24.961 --> 23:28.215
- Isn't he sweet?
- You're a wuss, Norm.

23:28.381 --> 23:33.012
- Let me finish!
- Norman, stand up to them.

23:33.179 --> 23:39.185
I won't throw away 11 years of marriage.
I'm looking for someone to hauI it away!

23:39.352 --> 23:45.149
Let me tell you about my honeymoon
suite, or, as I call it, the Dead Zone.

23:46.484 --> 23:52.365
Want to see an impression of my wife at
the dentist's? Where's my jacket?

23:52.532 --> 23:54.826
This is gonna be great.

23:54.992 --> 23:57.161
Oh, shut up.

23:57.328 --> 24:00.706
Doctor, would you please
clean my fangs?

24:02.166 --> 24:06.087
- Do you believe this?
- I don't want to miss this.

24:41.915 --> 24:42.916
