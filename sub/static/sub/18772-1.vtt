<i>A long time ago, a powerful demon fox</i>
<i>appeared with nine tails.</i>

00:12.906 --> 00:13.930
<i>With its powerful tails,</i>

00:14.007 --> 00:17.135
<i>it could smash mountains</i>
<i>and create tidal waves.</i>

00:17.710 --> 00:22.511
<i>A band of Ninjas rose to</i>
<i>defend their village from attack.</i>

00:22.949 --> 00:25.543
We have to wait until
the Fourth Hokage gets here!

00:25.785 --> 00:28.117
We can't let it get any closer
to our village!

00:31.958 --> 00:38.591
<i>One great Ninja was able to</i>
<i>imprison the monster,</i>

00:38.898 --> 00:40.923
<i>but died in the process.</i>

00:41.367 --> 00:47.203
<i>This Ninja was known as...</i>
<i>the Fourth Hokage.</i>

01:04.524 --> 01:05.548
Naruto!

01:05.758 --> 01:07.658
Why did you do such a thing?!

01:08.094 --> 01:10.085
You're really gonna get it this time!

01:15.768 --> 01:17.133
I don't care!

01:17.937 --> 01:19.461
You know your problem?

01:19.606 --> 01:21.836
You can't do the things I do!

01:22.142 --> 01:23.939
<i>Only I can do this!</i>

01:24.144 --> 01:26.339
I'm better than all of you!
Believe it!

01:26.746 --> 01:27.906
There's a problem, sir!

01:27.981 --> 01:28.709
Lord Hokage!

01:29.582 --> 01:30.776
What is it?

01:30.850 --> 01:34.411
Did that Naruto do something again?

01:35.054 --> 01:37.682
Yes. He climbed onto
the Mountainside <i>Images....</i>

01:37.757 --> 01:39.884
And he vandalized and
graffitied all over them!

01:50.203 --> 01:50.897
Wait!

01:55.108 --> 01:56.132
Ha <i>ha....</i>

01:56.576 --> 01:58.237
Why should I?

01:59.078 --> 02:00.170
Hey, Naruto!

02:04.884 --> 02:08.080
How did you suddenly get here,
Iruka Sensei?

02:08.253 --> 02:11.087
The question is what are you doing here
when you should be in class now?

02:14.027 --> 02:15.221
Now listen, Naruto.

02:15.728 --> 02:19.824
You failed the last graduation test
and the one before that.

02:20.066 --> 02:22.728
This is no time
to be goofing off, you fool!

02:24.971 --> 02:27.963
We will have a re-test on
the Transformation Jutsu!

02:28.208 --> 02:30.676
Even those who already passed
will take it!

02:30.743 --> 02:31.835
Whaaaat?!

02:32.445 --> 02:34.413
Sakura Haruno. Here I <i>go....</i>

02:34.647 --> 02:35.136
Transform!

02:40.253 --> 02:40.947
<i>OK!</i>

02:42.355 --> 02:43.754
I did it!

02:44.490 --> 02:45.855
Cha!

02:46.626 --> 02:48.218
Did you see that, Sasuke?

02:48.328 --> 02:49.920
Next, Sasuke Uchiha.

02:50.263 --> 02:50.752
Yes.

02:56.369 --> 02:57.495
O-OK.

03:00.907 --> 03:02.932
Next, Naruto Uzumaki.

03:03.610 --> 03:05.237
This is a real pain.

03:06.179 --> 03:07.840
And it's all your fault.

03:07.947 --> 03:09.312
Like I care!!

03:12.018 --> 03:13.042
<i>OK...</i>

03:14.821 --> 03:17.551
<i>Good luck, Naruto...</i>

03:18.258 --> 03:18.917
Transform!

03:30.470 --> 03:31.129
How was it?

03:31.204 --> 03:32.535
I call it the "Sexy Jutsu"!

03:32.739 --> 03:36.766
You fool!
Stop making idiotic spells!

03:51.991 --> 03:52.650
<i>Darn....</i>

03:53.593 --> 03:54.389
<i>Darn....</i>

03:55.094 --> 03:58.154
I won't let you go home
unless you clean that all up.

03:59.766 --> 04:01.097
I don't <i>care....</i>

04:01.334 --> 04:03.666
There's nobody home anyway.

04:09.442 --> 04:10.306
Naruto...

04:11.878 --> 04:13.470
What is it this time?

04:13.946 --> 04:15.743
What I meant <i>was....</i>

04:16.482 --> 04:20.976
If you clean up all that mess,
I'll buy you ramen tonight.

04:23.656 --> 04:24.213
Huh?!

04:25.491 --> 04:29.018
Yes!
I-I will finish it in no time!

04:30.596 --> 04:32.461
<i>Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!</i>

04:43.943 --> 04:44.671
Naruto.

04:46.379 --> 04:48.904
Why did you vandalize those faces?

04:49.482 --> 04:52.280
Don't you know who
the Hokage leaders are?

04:52.819 --> 04:54.218
Of course, I do!

05:00.593 --> 05:04.051
I know they earned the title
Lord Hokage

05:04.263 --> 05:06.731
because they were the best Ninja
of their time, right?

05:09.802 --> 05:11.827
Especially the Fourth Hokage
was a hero

05:11.904 --> 05:14.873
who saved the village from
the nine-tail demon fox.

05:15.641 --> 05:16.801
Then why did you do that?

05:17.110 --> 05:20.375
Because I'll become a Hokage myself.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.873
And I'll be the greatest Hokage
of all time!

05:25.451 --> 05:30.013
So that everyone will finally
learn to accept me!

05:31.290 --> 05:35.283
By the way, Sensei,
I have a favor to ask.

05:36.129 --> 05:37.289
You want another bowl?

05:37.430 --> 05:38.761
<i>Mmmm....No....</i>

05:38.865 --> 05:41.425
Can I borrow that Leaf headband
for a while?

05:42.468 --> 05:43.093
This?

05:43.669 --> 05:44.658
No no!

05:45.104 --> 05:49.837
This is worn only by those who
have graduated from Ninja Academy.

05:50.576 --> 05:52.009
Tomorrow, you <i>will....</i>

05:52.879 --> 05:53.777
You're so mean!

05:55.181 --> 05:57.012
So that's why you took off
your <i>goggles....</i>

05:57.083 --> 05:58.380
Humph...
<i>One more bowl please!</i>

06:01.020 --> 06:03.454
We are now about to begin
the graduation test.

06:04.323 --> 06:07.019
When your name is called,
proceed to the next classroom.

06:07.794 --> 06:10.160
The test is on the Clone Jutsu.

06:10.930 --> 06:11.862
<i>Oh no...</i>

06:12.298 --> 06:16.064
<i>Of all the! That is my weakest Jutsu!</i>

06:20.406 --> 06:23.466
<i>But still...</i>
<i>I will do it no matter what!</i>

06:28.848 --> 06:30.145
Clone Jutsu!

06:39.325 --> 06:40.690
Disqualified!

06:43.029 --> 06:44.018
Iruka Sensei.

06:45.465 --> 06:48.923
His physical coordination
and stamina are excellent.

06:49.335 --> 06:52.566
And he managed to come up
with something.

06:53.139 --> 06:55.039
Isn't that enough
for him to pass?

06:55.675 --> 07:00.806
Mizuki Sensei...
All the others created three or more clones.

07:02.215 --> 07:04.046
Naruto created just one.

07:04.750 --> 07:08.982
And it's practically useless.
I can't give him a passing mark.

07:18.030 --> 07:19.292
I'm a Ninja now!

07:19.765 --> 07:21.562
You did well. That's my son.

07:22.068 --> 07:23.695
Congratulations for your graduation.

07:23.769 --> 07:25.532
I'll cook something good tonight!

07:26.839 --> 07:28.500
Look at that one.

07:29.342 --> 07:33.039
It's that boy.
I hear he's the only one who failed.

07:34.347 --> 07:35.507
Serves him right.

07:35.748 --> 07:38.273
Imagine what would happen
if he became a Ninja.

07:38.651 --> 07:39.879
Isn't that the boy
who is <i>actually....</i>

07:39.952 --> 07:42.477
Hey! We're not supposed to
talk about that.

07:50.496 --> 07:55.263
Iruka.
We need to talk later.

07:56.135 --> 07:56.658
Yes, sir.

08:02.775 --> 08:06.609
Iruka Sensei isn't trying
to be mean to you.

08:07.079 --> 08:09.639
Then why only me?

08:10.182 --> 08:15.882
He wants you to become strong
from the bottom of his heart.

08:16.923 --> 08:18.413
You both don't have parents.

08:20.259 --> 08:24.059
But I really wanted to graduate.

08:24.830 --> 08:28.266
Heh... I guess I have no <i>choice....</i>

08:30.670 --> 08:33.639
I'll let you in on a big secret.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.337
<i>Secret?</i>

08:40.246 --> 08:41.304
Iruka.

08:42.381 --> 08:44.372
What is it, Lord Hokage?

08:45.017 --> 08:48.714
I know how you feel. <i>But....</i>

08:48.921 --> 08:53.585
Naruto also grew up without knowing
the love of his parents....like you.

09:00.967 --> 09:01.797
Let me go!

09:01.901 --> 09:04.426
My mom and dad are
still out there fighting!

09:07.873 --> 09:09.636
Wake up, Iruka Sensei!

09:12.111 --> 09:13.339
What's the matter?

09:13.779 --> 09:16.009
Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!

09:16.682 --> 09:20.709
I heard that <i>Naruto....</i>
stole the Scroll of Sealing.

09:22.188 --> 09:23.416
The Scroll of Sealing?!

09:25.558 --> 09:26.684
Let's <i>see....</i>

09:26.959 --> 09:31.589
The first Jutsu <i>is....</i>
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?

09:32.531 --> 09:35.557
What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?

09:36.268 --> 09:38.759
Lord Hokage!
We can't forgive him!

09:38.838 --> 09:39.896
This is not just a prank!

09:39.972 --> 09:43.840
The Scroll is a dangerous item
that the First Hokage sealed!

09:44.343 --> 09:45.776
Depending on its <i>use....</i>

09:46.579 --> 09:49.912
It will be a major disaster if
it is taken out of the village!

09:51.751 --> 09:54.311
Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!

09:54.687 --> 09:55.312
Yes, sir!

10:06.065 --> 10:07.430
<i>Where did you go... Naruto?</i>

10:16.108 --> 10:19.669
<i>I will tell everyone in the village</i>
<i>about this and eliminate Naruto...</i>

10:20.413 --> 10:23.246
<i>Then the Scroll of Sealing</i>
<i>will be mine!</i>

10:38.931 --> 10:41.365
Hey you, Naruto!

10:47.139 --> 10:48.936
You found me...

10:49.175 --> 10:51.905
And I've only learned one Jutsu.

10:53.145 --> 10:55.204
<i>He's been practicing the Jutsu...</i>

10:55.781 --> 10:57.476
<i>until he's become</i>
<i>this exhausted and dirty?</i>

10:57.616 --> 11:00.813
Listen, listen!
I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!

11:01.053 --> 11:02.987
You're gonna let me graduate
if I can do it!

11:03.222 --> 11:06.749
Isn't it true that I can graduate if
I can do one of the Jutsu written here?

11:07.793 --> 11:08.987
Who told you that?

11:09.361 --> 11:14.958
Mizuki Sensei. He told me
about this scroll, and this <i>place....</i>

11:18.404 --> 11:19.268
Mizuki did?!

11:24.810 --> 11:26.300
I'm impressed you found this place.

11:27.613 --> 11:30.104
I see <i>now....how</i> it is.

11:33.285 --> 11:36.584
Naruto, give me that scroll.

11:37.123 --> 11:40.251
Wait, <i>wait....</i>
What's going on here?

11:42.728 --> 11:45.253
Naruto! Never give him that scroll!

11:45.965 --> 11:50.231
It is a dangerous object that contains
forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.

11:50.770 --> 11:54.035
Mizuki used you in order to
get it for himself!

11:54.707 --> 11:55.469
W-Wha...?

11:56.075 --> 12:00.944
Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of
you holding that scroll!

12:01.347 --> 12:01.904
Huh?

12:04.316 --> 12:07.683
What are you saying, Mizuki!
Don't let him fool you, Naruto!

12:09.355 --> 12:11.220
I will tell you the truth.

12:11.457 --> 12:12.549
Idiot! Don't do that!

12:13.392 --> 12:17.328
After an incident 12 years ago,
a rule was created.

12:18.998 --> 12:20.226
A rule?

12:21.100 --> 12:26.333
That is, Naruto, a rule everybody
but you knows.

12:26.939 --> 12:30.466
Except me?!
What is it?

12:31.143 --> 12:32.371
Stop it, Mizuki!

12:32.978 --> 12:36.971
The rule forbids anyone from revealing
that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!

12:37.917 --> 12:38.349
Huh?

12:39.485 --> 12:43.080
You are actually the Demon,
Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,

12:43.155 --> 12:46.147
who killed Iruka's parents and
destroyed our village!

12:46.525 --> 12:47.492
Stop it!

12:48.994 --> 12:52.122
Everyone has been
deceiving you ever since.

12:53.299 --> 12:55.358
Didn't you find it strange?

12:56.135 --> 12:58.069
Why everyone hated you so much?

12:58.771 --> 13:03.105
No! No! No! No! No!

13:03.976 --> 13:05.068
<i>Naruto....</i>

13:05.578 --> 13:10.606
Nobody accepts you.
That's why Iruka hates you so much!

13:12.451 --> 13:16.979
<i>Iruka... Naruto grew up</i>
<i>without the love of parents.</i>

13:17.556 --> 13:21.720
<i>Everyone avoids him like</i>
<i>the plague after what happened.</i>

13:22.361 --> 13:27.424
<i>That's why he keeps misbehaving.</i>

13:28.100 --> 13:33.333
<i>It's the only way for him to get</i>
<i>any attention or acknowledgement.</i>

13:33.873 --> 13:37.866
<i>He pretends to be tough,</i>
<i>but inside he is really hurting.</i>

13:38.544 --> 13:40.068
Die, Naruto!

13:42.815 --> 13:44.146
Naruto!
Get down!

13:57.363 --> 13:59.490
<i>Why....?</i>

14:01.467 --> 14:03.059
Because you and I are the same.

14:04.203 --> 14:05.966
After my parents died,

14:06.305 --> 14:10.833
nobody paid attention to me
or gave me any support.

14:12.478 --> 14:14.207
I wasn't a good student in school.

14:14.280 --> 14:19.980
I was the class <i>clown....</i>
because I wanted people to notice me.

14:20.753 --> 14:26.589
I couldn't get noticed through excellence,
so I kept doing stupid things.

14:30.129 --> 14:31.187
It was so hard.

14:33.632 --> 14:35.623
Isn't that right, Naruto?

14:36.735 --> 14:41.570
You felt so lonely....right?
And you suffered inside, right?

14:42.942 --> 14:44.637
I'm sorry, <i>Naruto.....</i>

14:45.544 --> 14:50.811
If I had been more responsible,
maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.

14:54.219 --> 14:55.686
Don't make me laugh!

14:55.988 --> 15:00.254
Iruka has always hated you,
ever since you killed his parents!

15:01.126 --> 15:04.789
He's just saying all that
to get the Scroll of Sealing back!

15:08.367 --> 15:09.129
Naruto!

15:11.036 --> 15:12.833
Narutoooooo!

15:15.441 --> 15:18.376
He is not the type of kid
who will change his mind.

15:19.445 --> 15:22.676
He will take revenge against
our village using that scroll!

15:24.149 --> 15:27.983
Didn't you see his eyes?
Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.

15:31.190 --> 15:36.287
No....
Naruto....isn't....like that at all!

15:39.164 --> 15:42.827
All I want is to kill Naruto
and get the scroll.

15:43.702 --> 15:45.192
I'll take care of you later!

15:45.671 --> 15:47.332
I-I won't let you....

15:51.110 --> 15:52.338
Well, well.

15:52.845 --> 15:54.870
Mizuki has a big mouth!

15:55.414 --> 15:58.281
Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.

15:58.717 --> 16:02.050
He might unleash
the power locked up inside him.

16:02.688 --> 16:07.057
The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.

16:07.559 --> 16:11.325
There's a slight chance
he might actually release

16:11.397 --> 16:14.662
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit
sealed inside him!

16:15.734 --> 16:16.962
If that <i>happens....</i>

16:19.571 --> 16:20.435
<i>I've found him!</i>

16:22.508 --> 16:23.338
Naruto!

16:23.675 --> 16:25.472
Everything that Mizuki said
was a lie!

16:25.744 --> 16:29.646
Give me that scroll, quick!
Mizuki is after the scroll!

16:45.431 --> 16:46.989
It can't <i>be....</i>

16:52.838 --> 16:55.238
Why is it, Naruto?

16:57.142 --> 16:58.131
<i>How....</i>

16:58.210 --> 17:01.737
did you know I wasn't <i>Iruka....?</i>

17:05.751 --> 17:07.685
Because I'm Iruka.

17:09.354 --> 17:10.548
I see.

17:13.157 --> 17:16.423
What's in it for you to protect
the one who killed your family?

17:16.862 --> 17:20.194
I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot
like you get that scroll!

17:20.833 --> 17:24.826
You're the idiot.
Naruto is the same as me.

17:26.238 --> 17:27.102
Same?

17:27.638 --> 17:31.302
Anyone can do whatever
he wants once he has the scroll.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.478
There is no way that that <i>monster....</i>

17:33.545 --> 17:37.072
that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage
of the power of that scroll!

17:38.050 --> 17:39.176
You're <i>right....</i>

17:42.721 --> 17:44.484
<i>I guess it was true all along!</i>

17:45.357 --> 17:51.296
<i>See, Iruka Sensei never really</i>
<i>cared for me at all!</i>

17:51.797 --> 17:53.424
...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.

17:55.534 --> 17:57.263
But Naruto is different!

17:57.569 --> 18:02.472
I know that he is an exceptional student.

18:03.675 --> 18:04.835
He works very hard,

18:05.244 --> 18:09.114
and he's single-minded
and clumsy at the same time.

18:09.114 --> 18:15.212
No one accepts him, but he knows
the meaning of human suffering.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.856
He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.

18:17.923 --> 18:20.551
He's Naruto Uzumaki of
the Vlllage Hidden in the Leaves!

18:25.964 --> 18:28.524
You are so gullible.
Iruka!

18:29.201 --> 18:32.193
I was gonna take you down later,
but I have changed my mind.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.038
Die!

18:36.008 --> 18:37.236
<i>I guess this is the end for me...</i>

18:44.917 --> 18:45.713
<i>Naruto?!</i>

18:48.587 --> 18:50.418
You surprised me there, freak.

18:51.690 --> 18:56.127
If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,
I'll kill you!

18:56.862 --> 19:01.231
Shut up! I can take care of a kid
like you with a single blow!

19:01.833 --> 19:06.133
Why don't you try then?
I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!

19:06.505 --> 19:10.168
Let's see you try!
Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!

19:11.443 --> 19:13.070
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

19:22.321 --> 19:24.016
<i>Naruto! You've...</i>

19:24.790 --> 19:30.729
<i>Those aren't just images but actual clones!</i>
<i>That's an advanced Ninjutsu!</i>

19:32.831 --> 19:33.627
What's <i>this....?</i>

19:34.099 --> 19:36.590
What's the matter?
C'mon!

19:36.668 --> 19:40.331
Weren't you gonna get me
with one blow? Here!

19:40.606 --> 19:43.074
In that <i>case....</i>
I'll come to you.

19:59.324 --> 20:03.818
I kinda got carried away.
Iruka Sensei, are you okay?

20:04.763 --> 20:05.525
Yeah.

20:07.199 --> 20:08.689
<i>He's really something.</i>

20:09.301 --> 20:10.928
<i>Maybe it is true.</i>

20:11.003 --> 20:13.028
<i>Maybe he will surpass all</i>
<i>the Hokage leaders...</i>

20:16.041 --> 20:20.410
Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.

20:23.749 --> 20:25.842
Has anyone found Naruto yet?

20:26.218 --> 20:26.877
No.

20:27.386 --> 20:30.048
Darn, this is going to be <i>bad....</i>

20:31.056 --> 20:33.251
There's no need to worry anymore.

20:34.526 --> 20:35.584
Lord Hokage!

20:36.662 --> 20:39.222
He'll be back soon.

20:40.732 --> 20:42.757
Sensei, how much longer?

20:43.235 --> 20:45.430
<i>OK, you may open your eyes now.</i>

20:57.049 --> 20:59.779
<i>Congratulations....on</i> your graduation.

21:05.190 --> 21:09.524
In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!

21:16.702 --> 21:18.135
Iruka Sensei!

21:18.570 --> 21:19.730
That hurts!

21:20.839 --> 21:21.897
<i>Naruto...</i>

21:22.474 --> 21:24.704
<i>I was going to lecture to you...</i>

21:24.776 --> 21:28.303
<i>that the road gets more difficult</i>
<i>now that you're a Ninja.</i>

21:28.814 --> 21:33.080
<i>But I guess I'll just wait to tell you</i>
<i>that until we get to the ramen stand...</i>

23:09.548 --> 23:13.348
W-What do you want, you little shrimp?
Quit following me!

23:13.418 --> 23:15.249
You're smaller than me and

23:15.320 --> 23:17.447
you're saying that you're gonna
become the Fifth Hokage?

23:17.522 --> 23:20.650
I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's
grandson or not.

23:20.725 --> 23:23.285
It's not that easy to be a Hokage!

23:23.495 --> 23:27.864
If you want it that bad,
you're gonna have to beat me first!

23:28.500 --> 23:30.934
Next episode:
"My Name Is Konohamaru!"
