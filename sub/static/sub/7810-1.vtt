00:57.917 --> 00:59.375
--Argh!

01:02.084 --> 01:03.334
--Argh! Argh!

01:03.501 --> 01:05.584
--Ooh!

01:23.959 --> 01:26.084
Far, far away

01:26.251 --> 01:28.668
<i>in a magical part of the world,</i>

01:28.834 --> 01:31.251
<i>there is</i> a <i>special place</i> -

01:31.417 --> 01:34.084
<i>the sleepy town
of Warrnambool.</i>

01:35.751 --> 01:39.626
<i>Where fairy penguins</i> -
<i>the littlest penguins of all</i> -

01:39.792 --> 01:41.625
<i>call home.</i>

01:45.709 --> 01:49.001
<i>They nest on a rocky place
called Middle Island.</i>

01:50.001 --> 01:52.209
<i>For years,
the townspeople</i>

01:52.376 --> 01:54.751
<i>walked the shallow channel
to the island</i>

01:54.917 --> 01:59.417
<i>to watch thousands of fairy
penguins return home at night.</i>

02:01.751 --> 02:06.209
<i>Because the penguins brought
a special magic to the town.</i>

02:10.417 --> 02:12.334
<i>But one night,</i>

02:12.501 --> 02:15.793
<i>foxes found that they too
could walk to the island.</i>

02:20.501 --> 02:23.168
<i>And in just
a few short years...</i>

02:26.709 --> 02:29.459
<i>...there were hardly
any penguins left.</i>

02:33.876 --> 02:35.793
<i>And there was nothing
the townspeople</i>

02:35.959 --> 02:37.917
<i>could do to save them.</i>

02:55.542 --> 02:57.500
This is just awful.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.042
Especially if you're a penguin.

03:00.209 --> 03:03.501
Jack, Zoe,
how many penguins are left?

03:03.667 --> 03:06.000
You know, I'm gonna let Watt
be the angel of doom.

03:07.042 --> 03:10.750
Em, look, you should know that
the numbers aren't great, OK?

03:12.084 --> 03:14.042
Morning, Emily.
Sorry to be the...

03:14.209 --> 03:16.209
- How many, Mr Watt?
-20.

03:16.376 --> 03:18.293
W-what?
You just did your count.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.376
Maybe some left already.

03:20.542 --> 03:23.917
Zoe did her count at dawn before
they go out to hunt. It's 20.

03:24.084 --> 03:27.251
I remember when there were
thousands here. What a shame.

03:27.417 --> 03:29.334
Maybe they're just staying out
to protect themselves.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.459
We just need to hold
the foxes off a little while.

03:31.626 --> 03:33.584
- How? With tranquilliser guns?
-Yeah.

03:33.751 --> 03:35.959
- See how well that's been going.
-I was actually doing alright

03:36.126 --> 03:38.251
till the foxes defied nature
and learnt how to swim.

03:38.417 --> 03:41.334
Listen, your annual review
is in two weeks.

03:41.501 --> 03:43.751
To keep funding
and sanctuary status,

03:43.917 --> 03:46.542
you need at least 10 penguins
to call this place home.

03:46.709 --> 03:50.542
- And at this rate...
-Mr Watt, Paul, please.

03:50.709 --> 03:53.917
You knew my mum. This sanctuary
was her everything.

03:54.084 --> 03:56.459
I can't let her down. Please.

03:56.626 --> 03:59.167
That's why I've stuck my neck
out with council for so long.

03:59.334 --> 04:01.292
I'm sorry, Emily.

04:01.459 --> 04:04.209
But if council sees less
than 10 penguins next month,

04:04.376 --> 04:07.834
the place won't be a sanctuary,
it'll just be a rock.

04:09.334 --> 04:11.709
So now what do we do?

04:11.876 --> 04:14.709
Well, unless things take a turn,
we're all out of work.

04:17.166 --> 04:20.209
<i>With the fairy
penguins almost gone,</i>

04:20.375 --> 04:22.417
<i>it seems
the magic of Warrnambool</i>

04:22.584 --> 04:24.792
<i>will soon be gone too.</i>

04:26.667 --> 04:29.751
<i>The town's only hope
now lies with...</i>

04:31.376 --> 04:34.834
<i>...a chicken farmer
and his very odd dog.</i>

04:35.001 --> 04:37.667
<i>-- They just don't know it yet.</i>

04:37.834 --> 04:39.834
Right. Ugh!

04:40.001 --> 04:42.209
Brrr! Brrr!

04:44.001 --> 04:46.084
Brrr!

04:48.334 --> 04:50.251
Ah, yes!

04:50.417 --> 04:54.042
Nothing like a good
cold kick to the ventricles

04:54.209 --> 04:56.251
to start the day, eh, ladies?

05:01.042 --> 05:02.667
Oh.

05:07.001 --> 05:08.584
Mmm!

05:09.626 --> 05:11.292
Beautiful!

05:17.876 --> 05:19.876
Morning, Missy.

05:23.334 --> 05:25.584
Oddball! Breakfast!

05:28.542 --> 05:30.459
Oddball, where are you, mate?

05:44.042 --> 05:46.417
Oh! Get out of there!

05:46.584 --> 05:49.959
How many times do I have
to tell you, you crazy dog?

05:50.126 --> 05:53.042
Here. That's your food.

05:53.209 --> 05:55.751
What are you waiting for -
a knife and fork? Just eat it up.

05:59.001 --> 06:01.251
Right, your turn to shower.

06:03.626 --> 06:06.042
The only Maremma dog
in history

06:06.209 --> 06:08.292
that can't bring itself
to guard chickens.

06:08.459 --> 06:10.084
Explain that to me.

06:10.251 --> 06:12.751
Huh?
Give me one good reason

06:12.917 --> 06:15.376
why I shouldn't trade you in
to the highest bidder.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.334
- Not that I'd get much for you.

06:20.792 --> 06:23.917
There's a good one, then.

06:35.709 --> 06:38.709
You! You're still grounded.

06:38.876 --> 06:41.792
So stay. OK?

06:41.959 --> 06:44.209
I'm off to pick up Livvie.

06:44.376 --> 06:46.459
And don't destroy anything!

06:48.001 --> 06:50.042
And if you do,
glue it back together

06:50.209 --> 06:52.126
so I don't know about it.

06:53.251 --> 06:55.167
Another day, another dozen.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.917
What happened to 'stay'? Eh?

07:00.084 --> 07:03.042
You are dopey if you think
you're coming into town with me.

07:03.209 --> 07:06.209
--Alright.

07:06.376 --> 07:09.167
Well, move over. Go on.
Shove over.

07:09.334 --> 07:11.042
Go on, over you get.

07:12.084 --> 07:15.167
Keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

07:15.334 --> 07:17.709
Took me six months
to pay off your last debt.

07:17.876 --> 07:22.209
Move over!
Alright. Off we go.

08:01.209 --> 08:04.626
I am really sorry
about the penguins, Olivia.

08:04.792 --> 08:07.876
You know, I'm sure that
your mom and her team,

08:08.042 --> 08:09.959
they're doing
everything they can.

08:10.126 --> 08:13.251
They're very smart.
Um...

08:13.417 --> 08:16.709
But, hey, you know what?
This gives us a chance to bond.

08:17.917 --> 08:21.209
Right? No? Maybe not.

08:24.209 --> 08:26.126
Hey, Olivia,
we're in a bit of a hurry.

08:26.292 --> 08:28.542
Did you get your bag
all packed?

08:28.709 --> 08:31.251
- Bag's on the table.
-Ah!

08:31.417 --> 08:33.333
Good. Of course you did,
of course you did.

08:33.501 --> 08:36.792
Because you...are mature.
You're an adult.

08:36.958 --> 08:40.333
What are you? You're, like...
you're, like, 30 or 35, 36.

08:40.501 --> 08:42.542
I'm 9.

08:42.708 --> 08:45.376
I know, I was joking. A joke.

08:45.542 --> 08:48.001
Hey, I was going to wait
until your mom got here,

08:48.167 --> 08:50.834
but no time like the present.

08:51.001 --> 08:53.667
--OK, well, that is for you.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.751
Just to say thank you
for being such a good hostess.

08:55.917 --> 08:57.834
Did you want crust or no crust?

08:58.001 --> 09:00.501
I always do no crust.
I'm going to do no crust.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.126
Thanks.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.209
I heard that everyone
is wearing those now.

09:05.376 --> 09:07.917
And why would I want to
be like everyone else?

09:08.084 --> 09:10.626
Oh...that's right.

09:10.792 --> 09:13.667
Your mom told me that you were
a bit of a trailblazer. No!

09:16.626 --> 09:18.876
Hey. Emily!

09:19.042 --> 09:21.292
No. No, no.
Everything's great.

09:21.459 --> 09:23.542
Right? Huh?

09:23.709 --> 09:27.334
No, we're having
a wonderful time.

09:27.501 --> 09:30.292
Don't worry about it. Huh?

09:30.459 --> 09:33.334
What? Your dad?

09:33.501 --> 09:36.251
When? No, no, no, no.
You said he was never on time.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.209
<i>Livvie. Calling Livvie.</i>

09:38.376 --> 09:40.292
<i>Out the from'
in T minus 10 seconds.</i>

09:40.459 --> 09:42.584
Copy, Grandad.
Be right out. Over.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.959
- Got to go!
-He's here. What do I do?

09:50.084 --> 09:52.459
- Ah, there's my Livvie.
-Grandad, flip me over!

09:52.626 --> 09:55.126
Hang on, watch me back.
I can't flip you over anymore.

09:55.292 --> 09:57.584
You're too big.
You'll just pull me over.

09:57.751 --> 10:00.167
That's because you're
such a great big giant.

10:00.334 --> 10:04.292
Grandad, you're not supposed
to bring Oddball into town!

10:04.459 --> 10:06.917
--Oh, shoo!

10:07.084 --> 10:10.167
Shoo! Get away! Go!

10:10.334 --> 10:13.251
I see you in there.
Get out here now!

10:13.417 --> 10:15.834
If you don't, I'm gonna
come in there and drag you out.

10:16.001 --> 10:18.709
- Oh, no.

10:18.876 --> 10:20.876
Come on,
you dopey thing. Get out here!

10:21.042 --> 10:23.042
Not the tie!

10:23.209 --> 10:25.126
What have you
got there? Hey?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.167
Come on, show me
what you've got.

10:27.334 --> 10:28.959
Oh, yeah, he's got
a bit of fight, don't you?

10:29.126 --> 10:31.001
What is it?
Where did you get that?

10:31.167 --> 10:33.084
- Hi.
-Hey. Where have you been?

10:33.251 --> 10:35.751
- Uh...
- Hi, Mum!

10:38.251 --> 10:41.001
Hi. I'm so sorry.

10:41.167 --> 10:43.501
Our first morning together
has just turned into a mess.

10:43.667 --> 10:46.834
Oh, that's OK.
Hey, I like your mess.

10:47.001 --> 10:50.709
- Let's go.
-Go... Wait, go? Now?

10:50.876 --> 10:53.959
Yeah. He'll just come in
and then you'll be trapped.

10:54.126 --> 10:56.667
Don't worry. Keep it fast
and don't stop moving.

10:57.709 --> 10:59.626
- Hmm.
-Hi, Dad! Right.

10:59.792 --> 11:03.001
- Let's get going, eh?

11:03.167 --> 11:05.376
Hi. Uh, Bradley Slater.

11:05.542 --> 11:08.042
We've met, um...

11:09.501 --> 11:12.376
- Oh.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.459
Dad, Oddy's not
supposed to be in town.

11:14.626 --> 11:16.292
You can't afford
a repeat of last time.

11:16.459 --> 11:19.251
Well, this isn't town
and your yard's got a fence.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.792
Alright, we've all got
places to go and things to do.

11:22.959 --> 11:26.042
I've got a big rehearsal tonight
for the opening night.

11:26.209 --> 11:29.667
- Goodbye.
-What's he doing here?

11:29.834 --> 11:31.917
I was called away
early this morning

11:32.084 --> 11:34.501
and Bradley really helped
us out. You behaved, right?

11:34.667 --> 11:36.667
Oh, we're practically BFFs.

11:36.834 --> 11:39.542
Alright, come on, then.
Chop-chop. Hop into the truck.

11:39.709 --> 11:42.751
Bradley helped out, eh?

11:46.834 --> 11:50.542
Really? You and the
tourism blow-in, huh?

11:51.959 --> 11:54.792
<i>l...l</i> like him.

11:54.959 --> 11:57.126
And he's not scared away
by the single mum thing,

11:57.292 --> 11:59.417
so don't screw this up, OK?

12:00.917 --> 12:03.834
Alright.
It's none of my business.

12:04.876 --> 12:07.126
--Oh, just grind away, Betty.

12:07.292 --> 12:09.667
Come on, darling.
Hold your tongue to your left.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.501
--Too far.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.126
- Try the right.

12:13.292 --> 12:14.834
- No. Try the left.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.459
- No. Try the middle.

12:16.626 --> 12:18.667
Nope. Out more. Ah!

12:20.709 --> 12:22.501
Tongue out the middle.
Come on, Oddy!

12:22.667 --> 12:26.709
Uh, this Bradley,
what do you think?

12:26.876 --> 12:28.667
He tried to buy me off
with shoes.

12:28.834 --> 12:30.667
Lord help us.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.167
Well, you know if you ever need
anything, I'm always here.

12:33.334 --> 12:35.084
--Oddball!

12:35.251 --> 12:37.501
- Gross!
-Oh! Oh, wow.

12:37.667 --> 12:40.001
- Eugh, yuck!
-That'd make an onion cry.

12:40.167 --> 12:42.667
That is disgusting.
Definitely yuck!

12:42.834 --> 12:44.792
Oddball, that is wrong.

12:48.959 --> 12:50.626
Hello, little one.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.209
Reopening
the village

13:00.376 --> 13:02.042
is the first stop
in my tourism initiative.

13:02.209 --> 13:03.876
We have costumed re-enactors,

13:04.042 --> 13:05.792
this delightful
southern right whale.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.959
Oh, guys! I love you for
being on time. OK, here.

13:08.126 --> 13:10.042
Right, there. Nice
and slow. Come on, come on.

13:10.209 --> 13:11.876
Place it here.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.084
This is the piece de resistance
of the entire show.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.959
Is it good?

13:16.126 --> 13:18.209
There are only two of these
projectors in the entire world.

13:18.376 --> 13:20.751
You wouldn't believe the strings
I had to pull to get this.

13:20.917 --> 13:22.876
Alright, we will fire it up

13:23.042 --> 13:26.959
and then we project the movie
off the rising mist...

13:30.459 --> 13:33.251
The crowd will ooh and ah,
and in that moment, Ms Mayor,

13:33.417 --> 13:36.167
we will officially be
open for business.

13:38.917 --> 13:42.251
Good morning!
Have fun today. Hi!

13:48.626 --> 13:50.667
Ah, there you go.
And on time, to boot.

13:50.834 --> 13:52.542
--Oddy.

13:52.709 --> 13:54.917
See you this afternoon
when I pick you up.

13:56.251 --> 13:57.959
What's wrong?

13:58.126 --> 13:59.501
There was another penguin

13:59.667 --> 14:01.209
killed at the reserve
last night.

14:01.376 --> 14:03.501
That's why Mum wasn't home
this morning.

14:03.667 --> 14:06.292
Oh, right.
She's running out of options.

14:06.459 --> 14:08.751
They've tried everything.

14:08.917 --> 14:12.334
Well, I'm sure your mum
will come up with something.

14:12.501 --> 14:14.626
- She always seems <i>to...</i>
- Hey, Livvie. Hey, Oddball.

14:14.792 --> 14:18.001
Your friend's there.
See you after school, darl.

14:18.167 --> 14:20.167
- See ya.

14:20.334 --> 14:21.959
- Oddy!
- Oddball!

14:22.126 --> 14:23.792
He's taking another runner!
Go, Oddball!

14:23.959 --> 14:25.709
Livvie, shut the door,
shut the door!

14:25.876 --> 14:28.917
- Grandad, go!
- Seatbelt!

14:29.084 --> 14:31.001
Keen your eye on him.
Hang on.

14:31.167 --> 14:33.334
-Oddball!

14:33.501 --> 14:36.876
- Can you see him?
- There he is!

14:43.709 --> 14:46.709
Oh! Oh!

14:51.084 --> 14:53.251
Oh, my goodness!

15:17.751 --> 15:19.584
Oh, no.
He's turning around.

15:20.626 --> 15:23.167
- Oddball!
- You've gotta stop him!

15:24.417 --> 15:26.709
Ow!

15:27.751 --> 15:30.876
- Ooh!

15:34.501 --> 15:36.417
Stop that dog!

15:56.917 --> 15:59.584
Ooh! Ooh!

16:08.584 --> 16:10.042
Ow!

16:11.126 --> 16:13.042
By tomorrow morning,
everyone in Victoria

16:13.209 --> 16:16.667
will be saying the name
Warrnambool.

16:27.542 --> 16:28.917
Oddball!

16:29.084 --> 16:30.792
- Watch out!

16:30.959 --> 16:33.459
No,no,no,no,no,no!

16:42.251 --> 16:46.334
Ah! (GRUNTS) Ah!

16:46.501 --> 16:49.001
Somebody
secure the whale!

16:49.167 --> 16:51.626
Grab it, grab it,
grab it!

16:51.792 --> 16:53.709
That dog's
out of control.

16:55.459 --> 16:57.501
Sergeant Gosch to base.
We have a situation here.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.166
Judge Burns,
couldn't Oddball

17:06.334 --> 17:08.291
go to an obedience school?

17:08.459 --> 17:12.834
Miss Marsh, this is the third
time the dog's been in trouble.

17:13.001 --> 17:14.916
We have the support

17:15.084 --> 17:17.084
to fast-track
what needs to be done.

17:17.251 --> 17:19.459
And he is obviously dangerous.

17:19.626 --> 17:22.416
Huh! Oddball isn't dangerous.

17:22.584 --> 17:26.501
He's just...curious,
that's all.

17:27.541 --> 17:31.084
I'm sorry.
Your Honour, if I may?

17:31.251 --> 17:36.042
The tourism initiative is dead
unless this dog is alive.

17:36.209 --> 17:39.376
But that dog
ruined your hard work.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.001
Precisely. I know that.

17:42.167 --> 17:45.417
But that's why I don't want him
to ruin it again.

17:45.584 --> 17:47.959
Look, we can postpone
the reopening.

17:48.126 --> 17:50.917
That's not a problem.
But there's press in town.

17:51.959 --> 17:54.917
And there isn't a whaling
village in the entire world

17:55.084 --> 17:58.167
that can hold the news cycle

17:58.334 --> 18:01.084
like the story of
a broken-hearted little angel.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.292
A girl who loves her dog...

18:03.459 --> 18:06.376
--..she grew up loving.

18:06.542 --> 18:10.376
And, Your Honour, since it is
ultimately your decision,

18:10.542 --> 18:15.209
well, I guess
every story needs its villain.

18:16.251 --> 18:19.459
Mr Slater does make
a valid point.

18:19.626 --> 18:22.542
Yes, he does.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.917
Last chance, Mr Marsh.

18:33.084 --> 18:36.459
Oddball stays confined
to your farm.

18:36.626 --> 18:42.167
If he so much as sets one paw
within these city limits,

18:42.334 --> 18:44.251
it's the end of the line.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.167
Is that clear?

18:46.334 --> 18:50.501
- The end of the line!
-Yes.

18:51.876 --> 18:55.667
Case closed.

18:58.084 --> 19:01.334
Well, I gotta say that
Bradley bozo's got some chops.

19:01.501 --> 19:03.459
How can you be so cavalier
about this?

19:03.626 --> 19:05.584
We dodged a bullet in there.

19:05.751 --> 19:07.751
Oh, I'm just trying
to stay positive.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.167
What are you so bent about?

19:10.334 --> 19:12.709
Let's be honest. We've dodged
bigger bullets than this.

19:12.876 --> 19:15.251
Dad, I told you this already.
Look, none of this would

19:15.417 --> 19:17.376
have happened if you'd
listened to me this morning.

19:17.542 --> 19:19.459
- Let's go to the car. Come on.
-See ya, darl.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.751
- See ya.
-Dad...

19:21.917 --> 19:24.167
The penguins are almost gone.

19:24.334 --> 19:27.501
If we're below 10 next month,
council are shutting us down.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.417
Those bureaucrats!
They wouldn't know if they...

19:30.584 --> 19:32.709
It's not them
anymore, Dad.

19:32.876 --> 19:35.084
Nature is taking its course.

19:35.251 --> 19:36.959
No penguins
means no sanctuary.

19:37.126 --> 19:39.584
No sanctuary means no job
and...

19:40.626 --> 19:42.626
Well, there might not be
anything here for me.

19:42.792 --> 19:44.709
I have Livvie to think of.

19:44.876 --> 19:46.959
I will fight for the penguins,

19:47.126 --> 19:49.042
but I'm also thinking about
what's next.

19:49.209 --> 19:50.792
I'll tell you
what's next.

19:50.959 --> 19:52.876
I'm gonna march in there
and tell those imbeciles

19:53.042 --> 19:55.542
-they've gotta pull their...
-No, Dad! Dad! Just stop!

19:56.584 --> 19:59.501
Unless you can bring
the penguins back, just stop.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.751
You have done
more than enough for today.

20:22.751 --> 20:24.709
- Mum!

20:24.876 --> 20:26.792
Stop him now!

20:26.959 --> 20:28.876
- You're not a penguin, Dad.
- Come on, darling.

20:29.042 --> 20:30.834
Look at the camera
so I can see you.

20:31.001 --> 20:32.917
Give us a smile or something.

20:33.084 --> 20:35.001
What about you, Em?
Come on, darl.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.167
Do I get a smile out of you?
There you go.

20:37.334 --> 20:39.792
And if you get up
early enough,

20:39.959 --> 20:43.126
you can see them marching down
the hill on their way to fish.

20:44.167 --> 20:46.001
But even
if their fishing adventures

20:46.167 --> 20:48.084
take them
hundreds of miles away,

20:48.251 --> 20:50.626
they never forget
where home is.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.417
Because
they depend on each other

20:53.584 --> 20:57.834
to march back to bed every
night in a penguin parade.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.042
But even
if their fishing adventures

21:36.209 --> 21:38.917
take them
hundreds of miles away,

21:39.084 --> 21:41.542
they never forget
where home is.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.084
Because they depend
on each other.

22:05.167 --> 22:07.501
What are you doing
down there, mate?

22:10.251 --> 22:13.001
Oh. You're alright, mate.
I got you.

22:14.126 --> 22:16.334
- What's wrong?

22:16.501 --> 22:20.542
Ah. Tangled with
a no-good fox, eh?

22:20.709 --> 22:23.126
--Alright.

22:24.167 --> 22:26.292
We'll get you fixed up.

22:28.334 --> 22:31.334
Alright.
Let's have a look at you.

22:33.667 --> 22:36.251
--Oddball, get out.

22:36.417 --> 22:39.126
We've got an injured player
on the bench. Out you get.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.084
Jesus.

22:42.251 --> 22:44.792
--You'll get used to him.

22:44.959 --> 22:47.751
There we go.
I've seen it in chickens.

22:47.917 --> 22:50.209
I've even seen it in humans.

22:50.376 --> 22:52.959
So it's gotta be
the same with penguins.

22:53.126 --> 22:57.459
If you're damaged goods,
girls just won't come near ya.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.334
That's bad news
if you're trying to get a lady.

23:01.792 --> 23:06.417
'Cause you can't get a lady
unless you're all fixed up.

23:06.584 --> 23:09.667
Eh? Wasn't that bad, was it?

23:09.834 --> 23:11.834
-

23:12.876 --> 23:15.209
You're a good-looking
young fella, aren't you?

23:15.376 --> 23:20.126
Let's get you out of sick bay
and into the recovery ward.

23:20.292 --> 23:23.042
That's a boy. That's a boy.

23:23.209 --> 23:25.626
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.751
-

23:52.042 --> 23:53.667
What? What's that?

23:55.917 --> 23:58.917
Oddball, go back to sleep.
I'll check on Missy.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.834
What is it, Missy?
What do you see, girl?

24:44.626 --> 24:46.542
-

24:49.751 --> 24:51.126
-

24:51.292 --> 24:52.667
What's happening?

25:04.042 --> 25:05.792
Well...

25:08.709 --> 25:10.584
Well, I'll be blowed.

25:17.334 --> 25:19.251
We can't use Missy, anyway.
She's gotta stay here.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.042
- And look after you girls.

25:21.209 --> 25:25.126
Huh? No, Karen, this can work.
I mean, we save the penguins,

25:25.292 --> 25:27.209
everything goes back
to the way it was.

25:27.376 --> 25:29.292
Oddy's got it in him
somewhere.

25:29.459 --> 25:32.167
I mean, he's a Maremma dog. It's
what they're supposed to do.

25:32.334 --> 25:35.334
Plus...penguins
are just chickens in tuxedos.

25:35.501 --> 25:37.501
--Yeah, I know.

25:37.667 --> 25:40.209
I know, Barbara.
It's risky. It's Oddball.

25:40.376 --> 25:43.084
You know, if it goes south,
he's done for.

25:43.251 --> 25:46.501
But if this works,
and Oddball can pick up

25:46.667 --> 25:49.084
just a few brownie points
in the bargain,

25:49.251 --> 25:51.667
then whacko-the-diddly-oh,
huh?

25:51.834 --> 25:55.001
- Am I right?

25:55.167 --> 25:59.001
Yeah! I'm right, aren't I?
Thanks for the chat.

25:59.167 --> 26:01.376
-

26:02.417 --> 26:05.001
- OK. Are your eyes closed?
-Yep.

26:05.167 --> 26:07.751
- Alright. Keep 'em closed.
-They are.

26:08.792 --> 26:10.792
- They still closed?
-Yep.

26:10.959 --> 26:13.292
Alright. Hang on a minute.

26:13.459 --> 26:15.376
Don't open them yet.

26:15.542 --> 26:18.667
-Done yet?
-Not yet.

26:18.834 --> 26:21.126
- Now?
-Come on, mate.

26:22.501 --> 26:24.667
Alright. Now open them.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.626
--Oh!

26:27.792 --> 26:30.459
--Stay.

26:31.751 --> 26:33.959
It's alright.
You can get closer.

26:34.126 --> 26:37.126
Hello, little one.
Oh, wow.

26:38.626 --> 26:41.167
-

26:42.501 --> 26:45.542
- What's his name?
-Oh, well, you tell me.

26:47.209 --> 26:49.292
Pocket. We'll call him Pocket.

26:49.459 --> 26:51.834
Well, in that case,
young Pocket there's

26:52.001 --> 26:53.667
-got a crook wing.

26:53.834 --> 26:55.751
But pretty soon
he'll be right to go home.

26:55.917 --> 26:58.876
He won't have a home
for much longer, Grandad.

26:59.042 --> 27:01.876
Oh, that's part two
of the surprise.

27:03.292 --> 27:05.376
Come here for a minute.

27:07.042 --> 27:11.251
As we know, Oddball
isn't much chop on the farm.

27:11.417 --> 27:15.209
But it turns out that...

27:16.251 --> 27:19.417
...what he lacks
in looking after chickens...

27:20.459 --> 27:24.459
...he makes up for
in taking care of penguins.

27:24.626 --> 27:27.042
"

27:27.209 --> 27:30.209
Grandad, you're a genius!

27:30.376 --> 27:32.834
Yeah, well,
right now it's just a theory.

27:33.001 --> 27:35.292
That's where you come in.

27:35.459 --> 27:37.584
I'm gonna need your help.

27:37.751 --> 27:39.667
Before we put that dog
on the island,

27:39.834 --> 27:41.751
we gotta
come up with some tests

27:41.917 --> 27:43.834
to make sure he's up for it.

27:44.001 --> 27:48.376
Don't you think taking him
to the island is pretty risky?

27:48.542 --> 27:50.459
Yeah, but, you know,

27:50.626 --> 27:52.959
if you want the biscuit,
you gotta risk it.

27:53.126 --> 27:55.042
--Now, listen.

27:55.209 --> 27:58.001
Not a word to Mum, OK? She's got
enough on her plate right now.

27:58.167 --> 28:00.417
I knew she was wrong about
you not knowing how to help.

28:02.251 --> 28:04.626
- Let's get to work.
-Great!

28:04.792 --> 28:07.209
-

28:07.376 --> 28:10.751
We've got so much to do,
so I've devised a plan.

28:10.917 --> 28:13.042
Fox - we have to make sure

28:13.209 --> 28:15.459
Oddy will be merciless
in the face of the enemy.

28:16.626 --> 28:20.876
Flocks - we have to make sure
he'll protect lots of penguins.

28:21.042 --> 28:23.209
Rocks - we have
to make sure Oddy,

28:23.376 --> 28:25.292
-who's just a house dog...

28:25.459 --> 28:27.376
...can cope with
the rough terrain.

28:27.542 --> 28:29.917
Right. So...fox.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.001
- Flocks. Rocks.

28:32.167 --> 28:35.209
- I like it.

28:36.792 --> 28:39.292
If he passes the tests,
we secretly

28:39.459 --> 28:41.376
put him on Middle Island,
which means

28:41.542 --> 28:44.042
figuring out a way
to get Mum off the scene.

28:44.209 --> 28:46.334
I gotta figure out a way
of getting that stick

28:46.501 --> 28:48.417
-out of your hand.
-Um...

28:48.584 --> 28:50.584
That's still in the
concept development stage.

28:50.751 --> 28:52.709
Concept what?
Where do you hear this stuff?

28:52.876 --> 28:55.292
--Bradley. He talks a lot.

28:58.001 --> 29:00.501
If it works, we surprise Mum,

29:00.667 --> 29:03.876
get council to change their
minds and Oddball is a hero.

29:08.709 --> 29:12.459
You know, he was bred by
the Italians to guard emperors,

29:12.626 --> 29:15.251
so maybe this opera music
will kick him into gear.

29:15.417 --> 29:18.292
I'm a fox!

29:22.959 --> 29:25.667
--Yeah. Yeah! No. No.

29:25.834 --> 29:27.459
? La, la, la

29:28.501 --> 29:30.834
? La, la, la, le, la

29:32.376 --> 29:35.834
- ? La, la, la... ?
-Get him. Get him!

29:37.667 --> 29:40.001
Chicken egg
and this one's a penguin egg.

29:42.042 --> 29:43.667
Are you looking? That one.

29:43.834 --> 29:45.626
Now. Find the penguin egg.

29:45.792 --> 29:47.292
? La, la, la, la

29:47.459 --> 29:50.126
? Oh!
Presto a bottega... ?

29:50.292 --> 29:53.001
- That's a tennis egg.

29:53.167 --> 29:54.792
- ? La, la, la, la... ?
-That way.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.501
? Oh!

29:56.667 --> 29:58.626
? Ah, che bel vivere

29:58.792 --> 30:01.376
- ? Che bel piacere... ?
-What's that?

30:01.542 --> 30:05.126
? Che bel piacere

30:05.292 --> 30:06.667
? Per un... ?

30:06.834 --> 30:08.376
"No!

30:08.542 --> 30:10.209
? Di qualité
Di qualité... ?

30:10.376 --> 30:12.251
-Oh, yuck!

30:12.417 --> 30:14.376
? Ah, bravo, Figaro
Bravo, bravissimo, bravo... ?

30:14.542 --> 30:16.667
If it smells like
fox wee, he'll attack it.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.751
--Oh, jeez.

30:22.126 --> 30:24.042
? Ah, bravo, Figaro!
Bravo, bravissimo! ?

30:24.209 --> 30:25.917
That's it. I give up.

30:26.084 --> 30:27.501
? Fortunatissimo
Fortunatissimo

30:27.667 --> 30:29.459
? Fortunatissimo per verité!

30:29.626 --> 30:32.709
- ? La, la, la, la... ?

30:32.876 --> 30:34.751
He was so good with Pocket.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.834
- What's different?

30:38.792 --> 30:41.959
I know, I know!
I know! I know!

30:49.084 --> 30:50.876
? Bravo

30:51.042 --> 30:56.376
? Fig... ?

30:56.542 --> 30:58.459
It's the penguin.
It's like with real penguins...

30:58.626 --> 31:01.459
- He's got half a clue.
-J' La, la, la, la, la, la... ?

31:01.626 --> 31:04.334
--J' La, la, la, la, la, la! ?

31:06.876 --> 31:09.126
Look, there's talk of
moving them to another island.

31:09.292 --> 31:12.626
Because... No, I mean, we're
down to 17 penguins, guys.

31:12.792 --> 31:14.792
But this is their home.
They're just gonna swim back.

31:14.959 --> 31:16.876
Look, I know,
but nothing's working,

31:17.042 --> 31:19.584
so...how about a final push?

31:19.751 --> 31:22.042
Zoe, I need more fox traps
and poison.

31:22.209 --> 31:24.292
We should do a count
each morning. And, Jack...

31:24.459 --> 31:26.876
I think I need you here
every night.

31:27.042 --> 31:30.834
Every...? Yeah. Yeah.

31:31.001 --> 31:32.959
Never mind.
I'll...l'll figure it out.

31:33.126 --> 31:36.001
Oh, this is totally gonna
make a difference, isn't it?

31:42.792 --> 31:44.876
I'm sorry, Mum.

31:53.792 --> 31:57.167
All in favour
of the beekeeping tours?

31:59.001 --> 32:00.792
- All opposed?
- Nay.

32:00.959 --> 32:02.834
Motion denied.

32:03.001 --> 32:06.959
Sorry, Eloise. Maybe
if you had fewer stings, dear.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.126
You know...

32:09.292 --> 32:11.792
...l'm under a lot of pressure
to get things moving here

32:11.959 --> 32:13.917
after the Maritime
Village mess.

32:14.084 --> 32:16.334
I feel like the community
doesn't really

32:16.501 --> 32:19.334
have a place
in the tourist initiative.

32:19.501 --> 32:23.042
They're relevant
because they live here.

32:23.209 --> 32:26.459
More listening, less talking.
Who's next?

32:26.626 --> 32:28.542
Rich, from the Whale Watchers.

32:28.709 --> 32:31.167
- Afternoon, council members.
-Here we go again.

32:31.334 --> 32:34.709
This town has
an incredible untapped asset.

32:34.876 --> 32:37.292
Every day,
the southern right whale

32:37.459 --> 32:39.376
swims along our shores,
just going to waste.

32:39.542 --> 32:41.501
I doubt the whales
see it that way.

32:41.667 --> 32:45.292
You can't just come here and say
the same thing every meeting.

32:45.459 --> 32:48.251
Those lovely creatures deserve
a state-of-the-art facility.

32:48.417 --> 32:50.292
Sorry, gentlemen,
I'm gonna stop you right there.

32:50.459 --> 32:52.626
The first thing that I explored
when I came to town

32:52.792 --> 32:55.334
was a whale watching centre.
There's no place for it.

32:55.501 --> 32:57.667
All of the good vantage points
along the coast

32:57.834 --> 33:00.667
are either owned by farmers
who will not sell,

33:00.834 --> 33:02.876
or they're
government-protected.

33:03.042 --> 33:05.292
Well, yes,
that is the case right now.

33:05.459 --> 33:08.834
But...what if
in the very near future,

33:09.001 --> 33:11.292
there was a place
to build our centre?

33:11.459 --> 33:13.376
Plus we'd have a gift shop,
so...cha-ching.

33:13.542 --> 33:15.459
Enough of this.
Judge, call a vote.

33:15.626 --> 33:18.167
I'm sorry, Mayor, just
one moment, have you found

33:18.334 --> 33:20.917
a suitable location
for a whale watching centre?

33:21.084 --> 33:23.001
- Seems we've found a loophole.
-Yeah.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.792
Really? Well, I'm surprised
that I didn't find that.

33:25.959 --> 33:28.042
I am a huge fan of loopholes.

33:28.209 --> 33:30.001
You know,
ladies and gentlemen,

33:30.167 --> 33:32.459
the Maritime Village
will reopen.

33:32.626 --> 33:35.084
That's a given.
But this...this is...

33:35.251 --> 33:39.209
Well, this is the logical
next step in your town's image.

33:39.376 --> 33:41.751
You want tourism dollars, huh?

33:41.917 --> 33:44.709
You want...
you want sustainable jobs?

33:44.876 --> 33:49.209
You want a solution that fits
with your outdoorsy image?

33:49.376 --> 33:52.417
- Looking good, Mr Slater.
-The WWW.

33:52.584 --> 33:54.709
Warrnambool Whale Watchers.

33:54.876 --> 33:56.834
I like that! That is sticky.

33:57.001 --> 33:59.084
It's sticky. It's fresh.
It's right now.

33:59.251 --> 34:01.709
Rich the whale watcher
is onto something.

34:01.876 --> 34:03.959
We'll have the village
to show us the past

34:04.126 --> 34:07.001
and we'll have the new centre
to show us the future.

34:08.958 --> 34:11.208
- All in favour?
- Aye.

34:11.376 --> 34:13.126
Motion approved.

34:13.292 --> 34:15.542
Hold on. We don't know
where their spot is yet.

34:15.708 --> 34:18.251
- Yeah, sure we do.
-Middle Island.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.126
What? How did you know that?

34:21.292 --> 34:24.667
Like I said, these guys pitch
the same thing every meeting.

34:28.542 --> 34:31.458
Ah, crunch time.

34:31.626 --> 34:33.708
So we camp on the island
with Oddball

34:33.876 --> 34:36.583
and if everything goes alright,
he's on his own.

34:36.751 --> 34:39.626
Drop-offs after dark
and pick-ups before dawn.

34:41.042 --> 34:43.417
I'll need to have a little chat
with Jack beforehand.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.667
We can't have him interfering,
can we?

34:47.208 --> 34:49.626
I think I know
how to deal with Mum.

34:49.792 --> 34:51.542
Great!

34:51.708 --> 34:55.501
-You never cook dinner.

34:55.667 --> 34:57.959
You definitely like him.

35:01.084 --> 35:02.959
We can't
announce whales just yet.

35:03.126 --> 35:05.584
I just need some time to work
a couple of things out.

35:05.751 --> 35:10.501
Yes, yes. I am painfully aware
of what is at stake, sir.

35:10.667 --> 35:14.209
Uh, no, this is
not a flip-flop. No, sir.

35:15.501 --> 35:18.251
I will do whatever it takes
to get this job done.

35:18.417 --> 35:22.334
OK? And we can announce
at the re-reopening.

35:22.501 --> 35:24.542
Does that sound good?

35:24.709 --> 35:27.751
- H-hello?
-Hey!

35:27.917 --> 35:31.042
- Hey!
-Want a chat?

35:35.459 --> 35:37.959
- I've got my shoes on.
-I noticed.

35:38.126 --> 35:40.459
I didn't want to say anything.

35:40.626 --> 35:42.542
They look really good.

35:42.709 --> 35:44.709
Yeah, thanks. They are nice.

35:47.126 --> 35:49.209
I really miss my morning
visits with Oddball.

35:49.376 --> 35:51.292
I asked Mum to let me
stay over at Grandads

35:51.459 --> 35:53.376
for a bit so I could see him,

35:53.542 --> 35:56.126
but after everything that's
happened, she said no.

35:56.292 --> 36:00.667
But...if you were to take her
out of town this weekend,

36:00.834 --> 36:02.876
I'd have to stay somewhere.

36:03.042 --> 36:05.292
-

36:05.459 --> 36:06.959
Alright,
dinner's ready, guys.

36:07.126 --> 36:08.584
CRASH
-Oh! Whoa!

36:08.751 --> 36:10.126
- That's gonna hurt.

36:10.292 --> 36:11.751
-Sorry!

36:13.292 --> 36:15.751
Maybe next time
we'll get takeaway, huh?

36:15.917 --> 36:19.542
--Anyway. Goodnight, sweetie.

36:19.709 --> 36:21.376
Tell me the story.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.417
Please?

36:26.584 --> 36:29.751
The way Grandma
used to tell it.

36:30.959 --> 36:32.876
Uh, Well...

36:34.709 --> 36:37.292
Some people
call them little penguins.

36:38.334 --> 36:42.209
But fairy penguins
is the name they prefer.

36:42.376 --> 36:45.042
And they're small and quick.

36:45.209 --> 36:47.376
Here one minute, gone the next.

36:47.542 --> 36:49.459
And every time you see them,

36:49.626 --> 36:52.126
they use their special magic
on you to make you smile.

36:52.292 --> 36:54.834
If you get up early enough
in the morning,

36:55.001 --> 36:57.251
you'll see them
marching down the cliff,

36:57.417 --> 37:00.417
parading to the water
on their way to fish.

37:00.584 --> 37:02.501
But even
if their fishing adventures

37:02.667 --> 37:04.709
take them
hundreds of miles away,

37:04.876 --> 37:06.876
they never forget
where home is

37:07.042 --> 37:09.709
because they depend
on each other.

37:18.834 --> 37:21.084
We really appreciate
you looking after Livvie.

37:21.251 --> 37:23.459
- It means a lot to us.
-Oh, no worries.

37:23.626 --> 37:25.542
You two need some alone time,
I reckon.

37:25.709 --> 37:27.292
- Promise?
- Yeah.

37:27.459 --> 37:29.251
Well, listen to
your grandad, OK?

37:29.417 --> 37:30.917
- Actually, Dad?
- Yeah?

37:31.084 --> 37:32.876
- Listen to Livvie.
-Yeah.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.501
- Love you.
-Love you, Mum.

37:34.667 --> 37:36.209
-'Bye!
-Love you!

37:39.792 --> 37:41.376
- See you, darl.
-'Bye!

37:41.542 --> 37:43.667
- Have a great time!
-'Bye!

37:45.084 --> 37:47.167
How long do we have to
keep waving for?

37:47.334 --> 37:49.292
A little longer.
Are you packed?

37:49.459 --> 37:52.542
- Yep. All set to go.
- Cool.

37:54.209 --> 37:57.501
- Is that long enough?
-That should do it.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.209
Evening, Jackie boy.

38:08.376 --> 38:10.459
Swampy. What are you doing?

38:10.626 --> 38:13.459
You're going to be seeing
some strange things down here

38:13.626 --> 38:15.667
that I need you not to notice.

38:15.834 --> 38:18.209
- Not notice what?
-Exactly.

38:18.376 --> 38:20.084
Hang on, what about Emily?

38:20.251 --> 38:22.709
We're down to 15 penguins,
mate.

38:22.876 --> 38:25.626
Well, she is the reason
I'm doing what I'm doing.

38:26.792 --> 38:28.376
I'm just here
to catch foxes, sir.

38:28.542 --> 38:31.542
Ding! Correct answer,
Jackie boy.

38:31.709 --> 38:33.501
Correct answer.

38:38.584 --> 38:40.834
Up!

38:41.876 --> 38:43.709
- Off we go.

38:43.876 --> 38:46.126
Next stop, Middle Island.

38:51.042 --> 38:53.084
Come on, darl.

38:53.251 --> 38:54.709
No time to waste.

38:54.876 --> 38:57.167
Only a week
until the penguin count.

38:57.334 --> 38:59.876
- Oddy's keen to get up.

39:03.167 --> 39:06.292
Give us your hand, love.
There you go.

39:07.334 --> 39:08.876
Alright.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.501
You look like a Maremma.

39:11.667 --> 39:13.626
Heck, you even
sound like a Maremma.

39:13.792 --> 39:15.709
But I want you to show me
that somewhere

39:15.876 --> 39:17.917
inside that crazy dog routine
you've got going on

39:18.084 --> 39:20.042
that you actually
are a Maremma.

39:20.209 --> 39:22.251
Let's go save
some penguins, eh?

39:22.417 --> 39:24.376
Right.

39:24.542 --> 39:26.501
Actually, Livvie,
you should do this.

39:26.667 --> 39:29.709
I don't think they can jail
a minor.

39:29.876 --> 39:33.084
- Risk it for the biscuit.
-That's right.

39:39.959 --> 39:42.459
- Are you alright?
-Yeah.

39:43.542 --> 39:46.542
That's it, Oddy.
Get used to that penguin scent.

39:49.042 --> 39:52.001
Don't worry, mate.
Your friends will be here soon.

39:56.167 --> 39:58.251
Hey, here they come.

39:59.542 --> 40:02.667
- Oh, wow.
- Ooh!

40:10.834 --> 40:13.334
Go on, Pocket.
Go see your friends.

40:22.709 --> 40:26.542
Now, let's see
what Oddy's made of.

40:31.251 --> 40:33.209
- Ah!

40:40.001 --> 40:42.084
Oh.

40:43.126 --> 40:46.417
What do you know?
This might actually work.

41:08.167 --> 41:10.126
What's happening?

41:24.292 --> 41:25.876
Ha.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.209
Grandma's proud of us.

41:37.376 --> 41:39.167
How do you
figure that?

41:39.334 --> 41:43.084
Well...when it's Windy,

41:43.251 --> 41:45.417
she's blowing us kisses.

41:46.959 --> 41:52.167
And when the sun sparkles
off the water, she's laughing.

41:52.334 --> 41:56.459
And up there,
she's on every star in the sky

41:56.626 --> 41:58.959
looking out for us.

42:03.917 --> 42:05.876
Who's told you that?

42:06.917 --> 42:10.209
Mum did.
She tells me all the time.

42:17.334 --> 42:19.417
You can see half
the world from up here.

42:21.626 --> 42:24.292
I sound so small town.
I'm sorry.

42:24.459 --> 42:26.542
Not at all.

42:28.834 --> 42:32.626
If you want to see
the other half of the world,

42:32.792 --> 42:35.042
maybe we could start
with New York.

42:36.626 --> 42:38.667
Yeah, maybe.

42:38.834 --> 42:41.376
- Maybe?
-Maybe.

42:41.542 --> 42:44.667
- Yeah, maybe.
<i>-l'll</i> take that as a yes.

42:55.126 --> 42:57.084
Oddy, mate, get off me!

42:57.251 --> 42:59.751
- Give it a break, huh?
-Get up, sleepyhead.

42:59.917 --> 43:02.126
We've got to get off the island
before Zoe gets here.

43:02.292 --> 43:04.751
Alright, alright,
just give us a minute, will you?

43:04.917 --> 43:08.501
-

43:08.667 --> 43:12.376
You realise if Oddy
nails his solo run tonight,

43:12.542 --> 43:15.584
we are tickety-boo.

43:15.751 --> 43:18.292
Not a word to your mum,
alright? Hmm?

43:18.459 --> 43:20.001
Pinky?

43:24.626 --> 43:27.251
- Hi!
-Hi, Mum!

43:27.417 --> 43:29.501
Oh, I missed you.

43:31.084 --> 43:33.334
You and Grandad didn't
get into any trouble, did you?

43:33.501 --> 43:35.626
Trouble? Us? Of course not!

43:35.792 --> 43:37.876
--How was your trip?

43:38.042 --> 43:40.417
Oh, you know, I think
I might've caught the travel bug.

43:40.584 --> 43:42.792
--Oh, this is for you.

43:42.959 --> 43:45.751
This is for your adventures.
You can take pictures with it.

43:45.917 --> 43:49.626
- You can make movies.
-Cool! Thanks.

43:50.709 --> 43:53.417
I even missed you,
you hairball.

43:53.584 --> 43:56.126
Hey?

43:56.292 --> 43:58.209
Thanks for looking
after Liv, Dad.

43:58.376 --> 44:00.626
I hope it wasn't too much.

44:00.792 --> 44:02.792
My friend has one.

44:02.959 --> 44:05.001
You can put all your meetings
in there.

44:05.167 --> 44:09.001
Mm-hm. Her one's pink.
Yeah, it's so cool.

44:13.501 --> 44:15.626
Never as much as you want.

44:46.084 --> 44:48.376
And good evening,
Pocket.

44:49.501 --> 44:51.417
Off you go, mate.

44:55.251 --> 44:57.251
Hang on.
What have we got here?

44:57.417 --> 45:01.792
--Hey, she's got her eye on you!

45:01.959 --> 45:04.542
You're right. You're looking
good. Your Wing's all better.

45:05.626 --> 45:08.584
Hey, mate, she's coming over.

45:08.751 --> 45:12.876
- Go on. Go and say hello.

45:13.042 --> 45:15.376
You've got your tuxedo on.
Ask her to dance.

45:20.959 --> 45:23.459
Whoops!
OK, so you're not a dancer.

45:23.626 --> 45:26.876
- Can you sing?

45:27.042 --> 45:28.959
There you go.

45:32.334 --> 45:36.084
Hey, look confident.
Not too confident.

45:38.626 --> 45:41.876
Hang on, what are you doing?
You need to invite her in.

45:44.334 --> 45:45.834
That's better.

45:48.667 --> 45:52.751
Bingo. Ha! Job done.

45:53.792 --> 45:55.709
Alright, mate.

45:55.876 --> 45:57.792
I'll leave you with it,
alright?

45:57.959 --> 46:00.084
See you tomorrow. Ugh!

46:05.459 --> 46:10.084
--Ah, stay. Stay! Sit down.

46:10.251 --> 46:14.167
I'll be back.
You'll be right.

46:14.334 --> 46:18.001
--Uh-uh. Stay. Just wait there.

46:18.167 --> 46:20.876
This is your job now.

46:21.042 --> 46:24.042
Stay there. That's right.
Good.

46:24.209 --> 46:26.167
Hang on. Oh, oh, oh!

46:26.334 --> 46:28.584
- Ow!

46:28.751 --> 46:31.251
I'm alright.
Stay where you are.

46:48.959 --> 46:51.876
Alright, Betty, let's go home.

48:08.834 --> 48:12.584
- Oddy, where are you, mate?

48:19.542 --> 48:21.626
This isn't going to work,
is it?

48:30.917 --> 48:33.001
Did you have a dust-up
with a fox, mate?

48:43.917 --> 48:46.292
Well, spin me frisbee.

48:47.417 --> 48:49.876
om

48:52.292 --> 48:54.584
Looks like we're in business.

49:01.876 --> 49:03.959
See you tomorrow, Jack.

49:04.126 --> 49:06.209
Have a good one, Swampy.

49:11.834 --> 49:14.626
Alright, I'm ready.
Where are we?

49:15.792 --> 49:18.251
Hey, Em,
when you met Bradley,

49:18.417 --> 49:21.001
like...how did you know
that he was the one?

49:21.167 --> 49:23.876
15? We haven't lost any?

49:24.042 --> 49:26.292
Nup. I wouldn't go
getting too excited.

49:26.459 --> 49:28.417
There's probably
a couple of nomads in there.

49:28.584 --> 49:30.501
WOW! Ha!

49:30.667 --> 49:32.792
They're not laying eggs, so...

49:35.126 --> 49:37.626
Great. Good chat.

49:42.917 --> 49:44.917
We're still holding at 15! Oh!

49:47.459 --> 49:49.626
Alright. Seatbelt.

49:49.792 --> 49:51.876
Oh, a dashboard dance first.

49:52.917 --> 49:54.251
Yes!

49:57.542 --> 49:59.084
'Bye!

50:07.667 --> 50:09.751
You know,
we should do this more often.

50:11.542 --> 50:14.376
I know Bradley has been
hanging around a lot lately.

50:14.542 --> 50:16.626
You two been
getting on alright?

50:17.667 --> 50:19.667
He's not awful.

50:21.251 --> 50:24.334
-

50:25.417 --> 50:28.251
So, no fox attacks
in the past few nights, huh?

50:28.417 --> 50:33.042
Yeah. But try not to get
your hopes up, OK?

50:33.209 --> 50:35.126
'Cause it might
just be a fluke.

50:35.292 --> 50:38.626
Oh, it's no fluke.
Everything's gonna be fine.

50:38.792 --> 50:41.542
Maybe,
but we should talk about

50:41.709 --> 50:44.084
what will happen
if the sanctuary does close.

50:44.251 --> 50:46.167
You know,
keep our options open.

50:46.334 --> 50:49.584
But you can't just give up.
Breeding season's soon, right?

50:49.751 --> 50:51.667
Well, I'm not giving up.

50:51.834 --> 50:54.167
I'm just...l'm not
ruling anything out.

50:56.709 --> 50:58.376
Sweetheart...

50:59.751 --> 51:02.292
If Bradley's projects
in town go well,

51:02.459 --> 51:06.167
then...he might have some
opportunities with his company.

51:06.334 --> 51:09.626
And those might be
opportunities for us too.

51:09.792 --> 51:13.792
Wait, you mean
like...moving away?

51:15.251 --> 51:17.209
It's a possibility.

51:17.376 --> 51:19.292
But what about the penguins?

51:19.459 --> 51:21.626
And Grandad?

51:22.667 --> 51:24.584
Sometimes you just
have to trust that

51:24.751 --> 51:27.042
maybe I know some things
that you don't.

51:27.209 --> 51:29.417
Maybe I know
some things you don't.

51:29.584 --> 51:31.417
Like...?

51:32.459 --> 51:35.626
Like what? Livvie, what?

51:44.376 --> 51:47.167
Oddball protecting penguins?

51:48.209 --> 51:50.792
Uh...yep.

51:50.959 --> 51:52.917
Is he out there now?

51:56.292 --> 51:57.959
Sorry.

51:58.126 --> 51:59.876
Yep.

52:00.917 --> 52:03.001
Show me.

52:18.251 --> 52:20.751
You realise if anyone
finds out, Oddball's done for?

52:20.917 --> 52:22.876
I mean, you barely escaped
the judge last time.

52:23.042 --> 52:25.042
Yeah, I know.

52:26.084 --> 52:29.167
And that it could all amount
to nothing, anyway.

52:29.334 --> 52:31.667
Uh, yep.

52:31.834 --> 52:34.251
Why now, Dad?

52:35.292 --> 52:37.292
Well, because
they're just little fellas.

52:37.459 --> 52:39.417
They needed a hand.

52:39.584 --> 52:41.334
That's it?

52:41.501 --> 52:43.251
Well, yeah.

52:44.501 --> 52:47.584
Plus...

52:47.751 --> 52:50.042
...when family's
in a bit of strife...

52:51.917 --> 52:54.292
...you got to, you know,

52:54.459 --> 52:57.584
help out, don't ya?

52:59.584 --> 53:02.501
Alright, no rabblerousing
with the government people.

53:02.667 --> 53:05.876
OK, Dad?
Leave the higher-ups to me.

53:06.042 --> 53:09.334
But first, we're gonna need
Bradley's help.

53:09.501 --> 53:11.959
Bradley? No, we can do this
without the circus clown.

53:12.126 --> 53:14.084
I mean, I wouldn't trust
that man with...

53:14.251 --> 53:15.917
- Dad, listen to me.
- Grandad!

53:16.084 --> 53:18.001
- What?
-She's in.

53:18.167 --> 53:20.167
She's what? She's in?

53:20.334 --> 53:22.084
She is?

53:23.126 --> 53:26.251
Oh, good. No, no. Great!

53:27.709 --> 53:29.084
- Dad?
-What?

53:29.251 --> 53:32.001
- My way.
-Yes, love.

53:32.167 --> 53:34.334
Of course. Your way.

53:34.501 --> 53:37.292
Yeah. Uh-huh.

53:37.459 --> 53:39.876
Oddball
on the island?

53:40.042 --> 53:41.959
I can't believe
this is happening.

53:42.126 --> 53:44.126
I know. It's...

53:44.292 --> 53:47.501
I mean, it...it's incredible.
lt really works.

53:47.667 --> 53:50.501
And...and penguin numbers
are finally holding steady,

53:50.667 --> 53:52.626
and right before
breeding season.

53:52.792 --> 53:54.709
We just need Oddball to keep
doing what he's doing and...

53:54.876 --> 53:56.959
- Wow.
-So I thought that perhaps,

53:57.126 --> 53:59.042
if a certain tourism expert

53:59.209 --> 54:02.667
could help us
sway the judge, then...

54:02.834 --> 54:06.001
- Emily. Hi.
-Oh. Jack.

54:06.167 --> 54:08.209
- Jack?
-Jack!

54:08.376 --> 54:10.501
Sorry, I couldn't find anyone
to trade shifts with me,

54:10.667 --> 54:12.584
but I'm gonna be back
out on the island

54:12.751 --> 54:14.667
-as soon as I'm off here.
-OK. Um...

54:14.834 --> 54:17.584
Wow, you look really different.

54:17.751 --> 54:21.501
Jack. Hey! Bradley Slater.

54:21.667 --> 54:23.959
Can you get us
a bottle of shiraz, please?

54:24.126 --> 54:27.251
Yeah, alright. Yep.

54:28.584 --> 54:31.417
Um, wow.
That was a bit rude.

54:31.584 --> 54:33.834
I'm sorry. I have something
I need to tell you.

54:34.001 --> 54:36.251
- OK.
-Um...

54:36.417 --> 54:39.167
I know how much
the penguins mean to you.

54:39.334 --> 54:42.334
Um, but...

54:42.501 --> 54:45.417
...the council are backing
Rich's whale watching centre

54:45.584 --> 54:47.501
on Middle Island.

54:47.667 --> 54:49.709
Once everybody realised

54:49.876 --> 54:52.751
that the island was
becoming uninhabited...

54:52.917 --> 54:54.917
Uh, What?

54:55.084 --> 54:57.751
You didn't think to tell me
anything during all of this?

54:57.917 --> 55:00.626
I wanted to wait
until it was final.

55:00.792 --> 55:04.126
- Final?
-Final?

55:04.292 --> 55:06.209
Right, I've heard
enough of this rubbish.

55:06.376 --> 55:09.501
- Grandad, no!
-I knew we couldn't trust him.

55:09.667 --> 55:12.709
Stop! You can't just
barge in like this. Stop!

55:12.876 --> 55:15.084
The sanctuary's been going
downhill for a while.

55:15.251 --> 55:17.334
At least this will give it
something to replace it

55:17.501 --> 55:20.584
that's honourable, and we can
think about our future.

55:20.751 --> 55:24.376
Stop right there!
What is this I hear

55:24.542 --> 55:26.709
about some whale watching
thing on Middle Island?!

55:26.876 --> 55:28.792
- Dad...
-Mr Marsh...

55:28.959 --> 55:30.876
Listen, you clown,
Middle Island is home

55:31.042 --> 55:33.001
to those penguins
and it's where they belong.

55:33.167 --> 55:35.084
--Oh! Ow!

55:35.251 --> 55:37.042
What was that?

55:37.209 --> 55:41.209
- Ugh! What is this?
-lt's a two-way.

55:41.376 --> 55:43.959
He doesn't care about
the penguins, he's just trying

55:44.126 --> 55:46.251
to feather his own nest, and
he wants you and Livvie in it.

55:46.417 --> 55:48.584
Right, that's enough,
from both of you.

55:48.751 --> 55:51.084
We'll catch a taxi.
Come on. Come on.

55:51.251 --> 55:52.626
<i>Ahh...</i>

55:52.792 --> 55:55.001
You know, if you had one ounce
of feelings for her...

55:55.167 --> 55:57.001
I care about Emily very much,
thank you.

55:57.167 --> 55:59.417
Then help us prove that
Oddball's fair dinkum.

56:00.459 --> 56:03.001
-And if his dinkum...

56:03.167 --> 56:05.459
...proves fair?

56:10.042 --> 56:11.792
Jack.

56:11.959 --> 56:13.876
...then the whale watching
centre will go away

56:14.042 --> 56:16.084
and I'll be out of a job.

56:19.501 --> 56:22.751
- Could you sit down, please?
-Sorry.

56:58.709 --> 57:02.834
This Oddball solution of yours

57:03.001 --> 57:05.251
really works?

57:05.417 --> 57:08.001
Like scrambled eggs on toast.

57:11.626 --> 57:14.292
So, Emily came
to see me about Oddball.

57:15.334 --> 57:17.667
People are looking to council
for something special

57:17.834 --> 57:20.584
to bring in jobs and money,
hence the whales.

57:20.751 --> 57:23.251
This might be my undoing
as a mayor,

57:23.417 --> 57:27.834
but the penguins
have always felt special to me.

57:28.001 --> 57:30.167
The one thing Judge Burns

57:30.334 --> 57:32.834
loves more than his bike
is the law.

57:33.001 --> 57:36.542
When I point out how exposed
the entire whale development is

57:36.709 --> 57:38.626
on account of being approved

57:38.792 --> 57:40.959
before the sanctuary
was legally available,

57:41.126 --> 57:43.126
he'll walk Oddball
on that island himself

57:43.292 --> 57:45.376
in his rush for due diligence.

57:45.542 --> 57:48.459
- Huh.

57:50.959 --> 57:53.167
You're a clever egg,
aren't you?

57:53.334 --> 57:55.709
I didn't become mayor
for nothing.

57:55.876 --> 57:58.251
We'll keep that dog
on the island.

57:58.417 --> 58:00.709
But be warned,
when they're forced

58:00.876 --> 58:02.792
to put their plans on hold,

58:02.959 --> 58:05.876
our approval ratings might
be in for a bit of a hammering.

58:06.042 --> 58:10.876
Oh, that's my
strategic advantage.

58:11.042 --> 58:13.584
- No-one approves of me, anyway.

58:15.834 --> 58:17.709
I don't mind you.

58:35.542 --> 58:37.959
This is a major setback.

58:38.126 --> 58:41.667
- This...this is major.
-Don't put this on me.

58:41.834 --> 58:43.751
You were the one
that convinced me

58:43.917 --> 58:46.001
to keep that dog around
in the first place.

58:48.126 --> 58:50.417
My office,
they think I'm a flip-flopper,

58:50.584 --> 58:52.501
'cause it's penguins
and then it's whales

58:52.667 --> 58:54.751
and then it's whales
and then it's penguins.

58:56.292 --> 58:58.667
Between you and me,

58:58.834 --> 59:02.792
I haven't had a project work
in years.

59:02.959 --> 59:06.709
So I could really use this.

59:06.876 --> 59:09.834
That's not really my problem.

59:10.001 --> 59:12.334
Now, scoot.

59:12.501 --> 59:14.584
OK.

59:16.042 --> 59:18.126
I hate that dog.

59:42.792 --> 59:45.334
-

01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:21.376
Oddball?

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.334
Livvie.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.167
Livvie.

01:00:32.376 --> 01:00:36.334
Six killed. We're under ten.
And we can't find Oddball.

01:00:39.584 --> 01:00:43.292
We'll, er...we'll find Oddy.

01:00:43.459 --> 01:00:46.042
Get this sorted out.

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:48.167
We can still fix this,
sweetheart.

01:00:48.334 --> 01:00:52.167
It doesn't matter anymore.
We're moving to New York.

01:00:58.167 --> 01:01:01.251
Sweetheart,
go help Jack and Zoe, OK?

01:01:03.917 --> 01:01:05.667
So, you're moving?

01:01:05.834 --> 01:01:07.751
What am I sticking
around here for?

01:01:07.917 --> 01:01:09.834
Because this works.

01:01:10.001 --> 01:01:12.501
Come on. Oddball wouldn't
have just run off somewhere.

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:15.167
Stop! I hope Oddball's OK.

01:01:15.334 --> 01:01:17.584
But as far as I go,
the sanctuary's done.

01:01:18.626 --> 01:01:22.501
What, so that's it?
Just give up?

01:01:22.667 --> 01:01:24.792
How dare you!

01:01:24.959 --> 01:01:28.459
Do you even realise what plans
I gave up when Mum died?

01:01:29.501 --> 01:01:31.459
Well, yes.

01:01:31.626 --> 01:01:34.251
But l...l didn't ask you
to do that.

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:37.001
No, you retreated
to your chickens

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:40.417
and left her life's work
blowing in the wind.

01:01:42.459 --> 01:01:44.042
Em.

01:01:45.126 --> 01:01:47.834
I didn't just lose a wife.

01:01:48.001 --> 01:01:49.917
I lost my best friend.

01:01:50.084 --> 01:01:53.584
Oh, yes. But I lost my mum.

01:01:56.209 --> 01:01:58.126
<i>L...</i>

01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:01.626
But I knew that the right thing
to do was to continue her work.

01:02:03.334 --> 01:02:06.001
It was my decision, yes,
no regrets,

01:02:06.167 --> 01:02:09.167
but it is 11 years later and...

01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:11.251
"Dad, the penguins are gone.

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:13.501
You know, I used to have fun.

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:15.667
I used to be a lot of fun.

01:02:15.834 --> 01:02:18.917
I didn't get to go to
university or see the world,

01:02:19.084 --> 01:02:21.751
but I'm gonna make damn sure
that Olivia does.

01:02:55.417 --> 01:02:57.459
Oddball!

01:03:00.501 --> 01:03:02.376
Oddball!

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:18.126
Oddball!

01:03:18.292 --> 01:03:20.042
Where are you, mate?

01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:23.876
Oddball!

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:27.959
Oddball!

01:03:32.584 --> 01:03:34.792
Oddball!

01:04:33.126 --> 01:04:34.751
Hi, love.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.917
It's been a, er...
it's been a while

01:04:42.084 --> 01:04:44.376
since you've heard from me.

01:04:49.959 --> 01:04:52.209
Just want you to know
that, <i>er...</i>

01:04:54.126 --> 01:04:57.751
Actually, l...l really
need you to know...

01:04:59.751 --> 01:05:01.834
...l'm sorry.

01:05:06.251 --> 01:05:08.334
When you went, I should have...

01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:14.667
...l should have
taken care of all of this.

01:05:16.709 --> 01:05:18.834
And our family.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:25.084
Oh, I miss you badly.

01:05:31.667 --> 01:05:33.584
Alright.

01:06:04.792 --> 01:06:08.376
Hello.
What are you two doing here?

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:21.251
Tranquilliser dart.

01:06:27.959 --> 01:06:30.334
Speak to Jack about this.

01:06:30.501 --> 01:06:33.667
Pocket, I'll be back.

01:06:36.042 --> 01:06:40.126
You know, love,
you were always there for me.

01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:42.459
Now it's my turn.

01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:57.709
Oddball!

01:06:59.126 --> 01:07:01.959
Pull over!

01:07:23.584 --> 01:07:25.834
Hey, mate.

01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:27.876
- Where were you?
-Found him in a gully.

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:30.334
Down back of Baringa Road.

01:07:30.501 --> 01:07:32.917
What were you
doing there, mate?

01:07:33.084 --> 01:07:36.292
Alright, what's the fine?

01:07:36.459 --> 01:07:38.501
No, judge's orders.

01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:40.751
It's the end of the line.

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:45.334
Handing you this
just saves me on postage.

01:07:45.501 --> 01:07:47.667
Oh, come on, mate.

01:07:47.834 --> 01:07:49.876
Mate, my granddaughter
loves this dog.

01:07:50.042 --> 01:07:51.959
Hey, don't make me
the bad guy.

01:07:52.126 --> 01:07:54.126
I'm just doing my job.

01:07:57.292 --> 01:08:00.834
I'm not...weird.

01:08:01.876 --> 01:08:05.834
I'm not a...weirdy weirdo.

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:10.417
Are you gonna
give my dog back?

01:08:13.792 --> 01:08:17.626
Oh... I'll give you two
a moment.

01:08:26.917 --> 01:08:30.209
-L'm sorry, mate.

01:08:30.376 --> 01:08:33.126
I honestly never thought
you'd end up in here.

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:36.001
- Sorry, mate.

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:38.251
What is it?

01:08:47.417 --> 01:08:51.376
Don't worry, mate. I'm gonna
get you out of there, OK?

01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:54.417
- Time's up!

01:08:59.209 --> 01:09:01.292
You rest up, Oddy.

01:09:01.459 --> 01:09:03.542
You're gonna need it.

01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:11.042
- Hey, Swampy.
-I just found this on the island

01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:13.292
and a matching
puncture wound in Oddy.

01:09:14.334 --> 01:09:17.584
- That's one of mine.
-Yeah, that's why I'm here.

01:09:17.751 --> 01:09:20.584
Are you serious, mate?
I retrieve all my darts.

01:09:20.751 --> 01:09:23.209
Emily likes it
when I keep her budget down.

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:30.292
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:09:30.459 --> 01:09:33.167
One, two, three, four, five...

01:09:35.042 --> 01:09:36.959
I am missing a gun
and two cages.

01:09:37.126 --> 01:09:39.751
I get why you would take guns,
but why would you take cages?

01:09:40.792 --> 01:09:43.334
For whales.

01:09:44.376 --> 01:09:46.042
Huh?

01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:54.626
Right, time to give
this clown a red nose for real.

01:09:54.792 --> 01:09:56.709
- Wait, wait, wait, Swamp.
-What?

01:09:56.876 --> 01:09:58.792
It's probably not the best idea
to just barge on in

01:09:58.959 --> 01:10:00.876
accusing her boyfriend
of being a penguin murderer.

01:10:01.042 --> 01:10:03.959
- You think?
-Yeah. Be subtle.

01:10:04.126 --> 01:10:06.959
- Subtle?
-Focus on the positives.

01:10:07.126 --> 01:10:09.292
- The positives?
-Yeah.

01:10:09.459 --> 01:10:11.376
Good news. I found Oddball.

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:13.459
- Oh...
-Can I tell Livvie?

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.834
- Er, I suppose.
-Is, er...is Bradley here?

01:10:16.001 --> 01:10:19.584
No. But wait. What? Dad? No.

01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:23.167
- What is going on?
<i>-l'll</i> tell you what's going on.

01:10:23.334 --> 01:10:25.251
I found a spent dart
on the island,

01:10:25.417 --> 01:10:27.334
Oddy's got a dart wound
in his shoulder

01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:30.167
and someone stole
a dart gun from Jack's.

01:10:30.334 --> 01:10:32.876
Eh? Proof. Look at that.

01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:39.084
- So, who are you suggesting...
-Who do you reckon, Emily?

01:10:39.251 --> 01:10:41.626
Who's got the most to gain
by the penguins being gone?

01:10:41.792 --> 01:10:43.709
Who jumped at the idea
to build

01:10:43.876 --> 01:10:45.792
a whale watching centre
on Middle Island?

01:10:45.959 --> 01:10:49.126
And who knows the final
penguin count is tomorrow?

01:10:49.292 --> 01:10:51.334
- This bloke's good.
-Thanks.

01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:55.501
Uh... What do you
expect me to do?

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:58.459
- I mean, Bradley would never...
-Oh, Emily, just forget who.

01:10:58.626 --> 01:11:00.959
Somebody hurt Oddball
and those penguins deliberately

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:03.959
and whoever did it will come
back tonight and finish the job.

01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:07.459
Em...

01:11:10.584 --> 01:11:15.084
Look, I'm sorry
I've let you down in the past.

01:11:15.251 --> 01:11:18.042
But I want you to know
I'm gonna make it up to you.

01:11:18.209 --> 01:11:20.126
Just give me a chance
to make it right.

01:11:20.292 --> 01:11:22.376
Is Oddball alright?

01:11:27.959 --> 01:11:30.459
He sure is, sweetheart.

01:11:30.626 --> 01:11:32.792
Me and Jack are gonna get him
back on the island.

01:11:32.959 --> 01:11:35.417
Besides,
we should be celebrating.

01:11:35.584 --> 01:11:39.417
Today on the island, I saw
a little fella called Pocket

01:11:39.584 --> 01:11:41.876
with his sweet little
lady friend.

01:11:42.042 --> 01:11:44.751
- During the day?
-Mm-hm.

01:11:44.917 --> 01:11:47.126
- But that means eggs!
-Eggs.

01:11:47.292 --> 01:11:49.001
There could be eggs.

01:11:49.167 --> 01:11:52.876
Dad, the review counts eggs
the same as penguins.

01:11:53.959 --> 01:11:56.084
Uh, YUP-

01:11:57.876 --> 01:12:01.417
Alright, what's the plan?

01:12:11.042 --> 01:12:12.959
Look, an open window.

01:12:13.126 --> 01:12:15.501
OK, I see it.

01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:27.167
It's stuck.

01:12:27.334 --> 01:12:28.959
- Grandad.
-What?

01:12:29.126 --> 01:12:31.667
You'll never fit through there.
You'll have to lift me in.

01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:33.959
No, no, no. I can't let you
go through there on your own.

01:12:34.126 --> 01:12:36.084
I'll open the door
once I'm in there for you.

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:38.709
<i>-L'll</i> be fine.
- No.

01:12:38.876 --> 01:12:40.959
I'll be fine.

01:12:43.334 --> 01:12:45.042
Alright.

01:12:45.209 --> 01:12:46.626
- Stiff as a board.
-Yep...

01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:48.334
- Arms forward.
-Yep.

01:12:50.042 --> 01:12:52.042
I've gotta be honest, kid,

01:12:52.209 --> 01:12:55.834
this is not my proudest day
as a grandfather.

01:12:56.876 --> 01:12:58.417
Oh!

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:03.292
Livvie. Be careful.

01:13:03.459 --> 01:13:06.209
I Will. I'll be right back.

01:13:09.334 --> 01:13:11.792
I'm pretty sure this is
the opposite of fine.

01:13:12.876 --> 01:13:14.709
Here.

01:13:14.876 --> 01:13:17.292
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm not... I can't do guns.

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:20.876
- They're only darts.
-OK.

01:13:21.042 --> 01:13:24.792
Um, just so you know, I...

01:13:24.959 --> 01:13:27.167
- I really appreciate this.
-Right.

01:13:28.209 --> 01:13:29.751
--Oh!

01:13:29.917 --> 01:13:32.417
Oh! Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry! It just went off!

01:13:32.584 --> 01:13:34.501
- Are you alright?
-lt's alright, it's alright.

01:13:34.667 --> 01:13:36.584
It's just...
It's not a strong dose.

01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:38.834
It's just enough to take down
a small animal.

01:13:39.001 --> 01:13:41.917
Jack? Jack, are you OK?

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.792
You're
a worrywart. Do you know that?

01:13:44.959 --> 01:13:47.376
Oh. No, no, no.

01:13:47.542 --> 01:13:50.501
- Are we flying?
-Jack, listen to me.

01:13:50.667 --> 01:13:52.751
We should fly
to the island.

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:55.959
- Jack?

01:14:12.084 --> 01:14:13.876
Livvie!

01:14:15.001 --> 01:14:17.084
I'm going to hell for this.

01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:26.376
--Whoa!

01:14:26.542 --> 01:14:28.459
Oi, I know something
you don't know.

01:14:28.626 --> 01:14:30.542
Come on, Jack.
You've gotta help me out.

01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:33.209
? I know something
that you don't know. ?

01:14:34.417 --> 01:14:36.751
You're so pretty!

01:14:36.917 --> 01:14:40.292
- Wow. Just...get your legs in.

01:14:59.459 --> 01:15:01.626
-

01:15:10.292 --> 01:15:11.959
Good boy.

01:15:43.292 --> 01:15:47.626
--Get off me! Get off me!

01:15:50.626 --> 01:15:54.126
Ah! Ahh! Not the ears!
Not the ears!

01:15:57.209 --> 01:15:59.209
'Hyah!
"Oh!

01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:08.501
"No!
"Go, Oddy!

01:16:08.667 --> 01:16:10.126
-4006s BARK)

01:16:10.292 --> 01:16:12.292
Stop! Stay! Cease! Desist!

01:16:12.459 --> 01:16:14.667
Hurry, Oddy!

01:16:14.834 --> 01:16:16.917
- This way.

01:16:22.084 --> 01:16:24.292
- Oddball!
- Jump in!

01:16:25.792 --> 01:16:28.626
- Oddball!
-We'll have to chase after him.

01:16:30.042 --> 01:16:32.709
- Seatbelt!
- Hurry! Hurry!

01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:38.792
Oddball is such a good dog!

01:16:38.959 --> 01:16:42.501
He brought us together
like this, you and me.

01:16:42.667 --> 01:16:45.126
--No.No,no!

01:16:45.292 --> 01:16:48.751
- Oh, dammit.
- Oh, pretty lights!

01:17:04.876 --> 01:17:06.792
Boogie, boogie, boogie.
I've got to boogie...

01:17:06.959 --> 01:17:08.876
-Jack.

01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:11.709
You've gotta be really...
Jack. Jack, Jack. Shh, shh.

01:17:11.876 --> 01:17:14.334
- Oh, you...you shush.
-No, no, you.

01:17:14.501 --> 01:17:17.084
- You've gotta be... No!
-You shush, man. You shush.

01:17:17.251 --> 01:17:19.209
Oh, gosh, it's Sergeant Gosch.

01:17:19.376 --> 01:17:21.292
Can you keep your foot
down off...?

01:17:26.626 --> 01:17:28.959
- Stop. Stop it.

01:17:29.126 --> 01:17:31.084
Alright.

01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:33.167
- Hi.
-Evening, Emily.

01:17:33.334 --> 01:17:35.126
Hey, fellas.

01:17:35.292 --> 01:17:37.542
I had you on the naughty side
of the speed limit.

01:17:40.376 --> 01:17:43.084
I think you should step out
of the truck.

01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:45.751
- I think I probably should.

01:18:11.501 --> 01:18:14.834
- Look!
-Where? I see him.

01:18:15.001 --> 01:18:17.709
We've gotta get out there.
Tide's coming in.

01:18:17.876 --> 01:18:19.792
It's not going to get
any lower if we wait.

01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:22.084
- What's going on?

01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:25.251
- Oh, Jack! Are you alright?
-Yeah. Never better, man.

01:18:25.417 --> 01:18:28.001
- What's up with him?
-She shot me with a tranq gun.

01:18:28.167 --> 01:18:30.417
- You shot him with a tranq gun?
- I didn't mean to.

01:18:30.584 --> 01:18:32.501
- Oh, that'll make it hurt less.
-Guys, look.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:35.584
- No, it was an accident, Dad.
-Dropping an egg is an accident.

01:18:35.751 --> 01:18:38.542
- This is extreme.
- Guys, look! Look!

01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:41.376
- Livvie! Livvie!
- Stop where you are!

01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:45.126
- Wait for us, Livvie!
- Don't go any deeper!

01:18:45.292 --> 01:18:48.042
Ooh!

01:18:48.209 --> 01:18:51.501
- Stop! Stop, Olivia!
- Just stay there!

01:18:51.667 --> 01:18:53.376
-

01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:55.876
Get down from
the roof of the vehicle!

01:18:56.042 --> 01:18:57.959
You get down from the roof
of the vehicle!

01:18:58.126 --> 01:18:59.626
- Get down from there!
-You get down from there!

01:18:59.792 --> 01:19:01.834
<i>I am...</i> Has everyone
lost their mind?

01:19:02.001 --> 01:19:03.792
Oi, someone's trying
to kill penguins.

01:19:06.001 --> 01:19:08.126
Get the light on them,
and get it together, Jack!

01:19:08.292 --> 01:19:09.667
Livvie,
just stay there!

01:19:09.834 --> 01:19:11.251
Please wait
for us, Olivia!

01:19:11.417 --> 01:19:13.334
And I have a gentleman
on the roof of his vehicle

01:19:13.501 --> 01:19:15.417
under the influence.

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:18.376
- Nice bottom, Sergeant Gosch.
-Requesting backup.

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.459
Hurry up!

01:19:37.917 --> 01:19:39.792
- Bradley, stop!
- Oddy, get out of there!

01:19:39.959 --> 01:19:42.417
- Oddy!

01:19:44.667 --> 01:19:47.584
- Stay back!
-Zoe?

01:19:49.334 --> 01:19:52.042
--Stay away!

01:19:52.209 --> 01:19:54.667
I've got your precious
penguin egg.

01:19:55.751 --> 01:19:57.667
Lucky number 10. Am I right?

01:19:57.834 --> 01:20:00.292
Wait, Zoe,
just...take it easy.

01:20:00.459 --> 01:20:02.792
Now, there's no need
for this to go any further.

01:20:02.959 --> 01:20:05.209
Oh, give it a rest,
it's your fault I'm here

01:20:05.376 --> 01:20:07.292
-in the first place, OK?
-What?

01:20:07.459 --> 01:20:09.751
These annoying penguins,
they were finished, alright?

01:20:09.917 --> 01:20:12.709
- It was time <i>to...</i>
- Whoa!

01:20:12.876 --> 01:20:15.209
...pop some champagne
and watch some whales.

01:20:15.376 --> 01:20:17.709
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa! Zoe!

01:20:17.876 --> 01:20:19.792
Livvie! Livvie, wait.
Livvie, no!

01:20:19.959 --> 01:20:22.167
You still don't get it,
do you, Emily?

01:20:22.334 --> 01:20:25.542
Typical.
How long have you known me?

01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:28.709
And you have no idea
that Rich is my boyfriend?

01:20:28.876 --> 01:20:31.542
- Rich, the whale watcher?
-And what's wrong with that?

01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:35.209
Well, it's just
an unusual...pairing.

01:20:35.376 --> 01:20:37.667
Zoe, please, just...

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:41.709
...put the egg down.

01:20:41.876 --> 01:20:45.084
OK. Fine.

01:20:50.876 --> 01:20:52.876
NO!

01:20:53.042 --> 01:20:55.126
- Livvie, wait!
- Zoe!

01:20:55.292 --> 01:20:57.626
- Livvie, come back!
- Get off me!

01:20:57.792 --> 01:20:59.542
Argh! Oh!

01:21:02.376 --> 01:21:06.209
- Hold her down!

01:21:06.376 --> 01:21:09.292
- NO!
- Oh!

01:21:09.459 --> 01:21:12.459
- NO! NO!
- Emily, no!

01:21:25.167 --> 01:21:27.667
Good luck getting that back.

01:21:27.834 --> 01:21:30.126
-Stop!

01:21:33.542 --> 01:21:35.001
-Ouch!

01:21:35.167 --> 01:21:37.084
Alright, come on.
Arms behind your back.

01:21:37.251 --> 01:21:39.959
- Ow, my arm!
- Settle down.

01:21:40.126 --> 01:21:42.042
That egg
is as good as gone.

01:21:42.209 --> 01:21:43.792
- It is over!
-Shh! Shh!

01:21:43.959 --> 01:21:46.501
Wait a sec. Where's Oddball?

01:21:53.001 --> 01:21:56.834
- Oddy!
-No, Oddball! Careful.

01:21:58.667 --> 01:22:00.709
- No!
- Careful, mate.

01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:04.209
- Slow and steady, boy.
- Whoa!

01:22:04.376 --> 01:22:07.459
Easy, easy.
He's right, he's right.

01:22:09.542 --> 01:22:11.459
Careful.

01:22:12.501 --> 01:22:14.626
That's it. Easy, easy. Steady.

01:22:14.792 --> 01:22:17.084
- Nice and steady.
- That's it.

01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:20.417
- That's it.
- Take it easy.

01:22:20.584 --> 01:22:23.626
- Don't eat it, mate.
- Ohh!

01:22:23.792 --> 01:22:27.167
Gentle. That's a boy.
Slow and steady.

01:22:27.334 --> 01:22:29.626
That's it.

01:22:30.667 --> 01:22:32.917
Alright. That's good.

01:22:33.084 --> 01:22:35.209
- OK, come on.
-Good boy.

01:22:37.417 --> 01:22:41.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ta... Take it easy, mate.

01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:46.001
- Slow and steady, mate.
- Careful, Oddy.

01:22:46.167 --> 01:22:48.209
- Slow and steady.
- Good boy.

01:22:48.376 --> 01:22:50.042
That's it.

01:22:51.084 --> 01:22:53.667
Good boy! Come on, up you come!
Give him some room.

01:22:53.834 --> 01:22:55.751
- Come on, boy.
- That's it, that's it.

01:22:55.917 --> 01:22:57.376
- Steady. Steady.
- Steady.

01:22:57.542 --> 01:22:59.542
- That's a boy.
- Now, drop. Drop it.

01:22:59.709 --> 01:23:01.626
- Give it to Livvie.
- Good boy!

01:23:03.417 --> 01:23:05.084
- You did it, mate.
- Good boy!

01:23:05.251 --> 01:23:07.251
Do you really think one
egg is going <i>to...</i> -

01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:09.334
- Ow! Jack!

01:23:09.501 --> 01:23:10.959
- Ooh.
-Jack?

01:23:11.126 --> 01:23:13.251
These things really do
just go off, don't they?

01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:21.042
Hi, little ones.

01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:24.501
- Gentle.
- There you go.

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:09.459
Thanks, love.

01:24:13.417 --> 01:24:16.167
Watch your head
as you enter the vehicle.

01:24:17.209 --> 01:24:19.042
Excuse me, mate.

01:24:20.084 --> 01:24:22.917
Do not lick the window!

01:24:24.084 --> 01:24:25.876
Don't!

01:24:26.042 --> 01:24:27.917
No!

01:24:28.084 --> 01:24:30.959
Hi. Mmm.

01:24:32.626 --> 01:24:34.751
- You're OK?
-Yeah.

01:24:34.917 --> 01:24:37.376
Just cold and wet,
but we'll be alright.

01:24:37.542 --> 01:24:40.376
Um, listen, Bradley...

01:24:41.917 --> 01:24:44.001
...about New York, I...

01:24:44.167 --> 01:24:47.667
I can't. This is my home.

01:24:47.834 --> 01:24:49.751
I kinda figured.

01:24:49.917 --> 01:24:53.251
- You did?
-Yeah.

01:24:53.417 --> 01:24:56.292
This place, it suits you.

01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:58.542
Not me.

01:24:59.667 --> 01:25:03.042
I, uh...decided
to quit my job.

01:25:04.584 --> 01:25:06.792
- Wow.
-Yeah.

01:25:06.959 --> 01:25:10.459
I miss my home.
It's been a while.

01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:27.501
- Take care of those penguins.
-Yeah, I will.

01:25:36.292 --> 01:25:40.917
I have
the official penguin count.

01:25:50.459 --> 01:25:53.042
The official penguin population

01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:55.959
of Middle Island is...

01:25:56.126 --> 01:25:57.959
...nine penguins.

01:26:00.042 --> 01:26:02.584
<i>- And one 699'-
-And one 699'-!</i>

01:26:02.751 --> 01:26:04.667
- How good's this guy?
-Ten!

01:26:04.834 --> 01:26:06.626
The sanctuary stays open!

01:26:06.792 --> 01:26:10.042
We did it!
-Yeah!

01:26:10.209 --> 01:26:13.501
- Whoo!
-Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:16.667
- Well done.

01:26:16.834 --> 01:26:20.251
- I have to just...
-Yeah, I know.

01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:22.751
I'll <i>be...</i> I'll be back.

01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:26.542
- Whoo!

01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:28.584
- Whoo!

01:26:31.251 --> 01:26:32.876
Oddy, come back.

01:26:33.042 --> 01:26:35.792
-

01:26:35.959 --> 01:26:39.542
You did good, mate.
You did really good.

01:26:43.584 --> 01:26:45.667
Hey, Odd)'-

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:47.751
You did it, Dad.

01:26:47.917 --> 01:26:50.084
I'm proud of you.

01:26:50.251 --> 01:26:53.792
Nah. We all did it.

01:26:53.959 --> 01:26:55.876
That's what I'm proud of.

01:26:58.292 --> 01:27:00.126
- Oh!
-Oddy!

01:27:00.292 --> 01:27:02.334
--Oddball!

01:27:02.501 --> 01:27:04.209
Oddy!

01:27:29.959 --> 01:27:33.001
Oddy.
Come over here, boy.

01:27:33.167 --> 01:27:36.042
- Come on, mate.

01:27:37.917 --> 01:27:40.417
That's my boy.
Come on. Up you come.

01:27:40.584 --> 01:27:42.126
That's my boy.
