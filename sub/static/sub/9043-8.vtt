WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:04.600
- I AM SO GLAD
WE'RE ALONE.

00:04.600 --> 00:07.800
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT DEBRA'S BIRTHDAY.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.267
- OH, GOD,
IS IT TODAY?

00:11.267 --> 00:13.500
- NO, IT'S A WEEK
FROM SATURDAY.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.900
- OH, OKAY.
DON'T DO THAT.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.333
- SEE, I WAS THINKING

00:18.333 --> 00:22.100
YOU AND I COULD PLAN
A SURPRISE PARTY FOR HER.

00:25.433 --> 00:28.567
- A SURPRISE PARTY?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:28.567 --> 00:29.900
- YEAH...

00:29.900 --> 00:31.367
I DON'T KNOW.

00:31.367 --> 00:33.633
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK
DEBRA WOULD WANT US

00:33.633 --> 00:37.700
TO GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE,
YOU KNOW?

00:37.700 --> 00:40.767
I WAS JUST PLANNING SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE LOW-KEY,

00:40.767 --> 00:45.100
YOU KNOW, LIKE--LIKE DINNER
WITH MY FAMILY.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.500
YEAH.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.233
- I THINK DINNER
WITH YOUR FAMILY, UH,

00:49.233 --> 00:52.100
HAS BEEN DONE.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.533
I WAS--I WAS THINKING
OF SOMETHING ELSE,

00:54.533 --> 00:58.800
LIKE A REAL
ENGLISH TEA PARTY.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.867
- [laughs]

01:00.867 --> 01:02.567
OH. OH, FOR REAL.

01:02.567 --> 01:04.200
UH...

01:04.200 --> 01:05.967
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN DEBRA WAS SINGLE,

01:05.967 --> 01:09.267
WE WOULD MEET IN THE CITY
AND HAVE TEA AT THE ROSEMONT.

01:09.267 --> 01:11.167
OH, SHE LOVED THAT.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.567
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:12.567 --> 01:13.833
THEN MAYBE YOU TWO
SHOULD GO DO THAT, RIGHT?

01:13.833 --> 01:14.900
TEA FOR TWO.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.100
- NO, RAYMOND, NO.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.200
LISTEN, DON'T WORRY.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.067
YOU WON'T HAVE
TO DO A THING.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.800
- NO, HEY,
I'M ALL INTO HELPING.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.400
IT'S JUST RIGHT NOW,

01:23.400 --> 01:25.400
IT'S--IT'S REALLY
A BAD TIME...

01:25.400 --> 01:30.400
WITH THE WORLD
AND EVERYTHING.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.633
- RAYMOND, I PROMISE
I WILL HANDLE IT.

01:34.633 --> 01:37.233
SEE, WE'LL GET AMY
TO TAKE HER OUT

01:37.233 --> 01:41.067
WHILE I SET UP
EVERYTHING HERE, HMM?

01:43.500 --> 01:44.700
- YEAH.

01:44.700 --> 01:49.100
- OOH, IT'S SUCH FUN
CONSPIRING WITH YOU.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.033
WE'RE LIKE
TWO SECRET AGENTS.

01:51.033 --> 01:52.533
- HMM, YEAH...

01:52.533 --> 01:54.567
YEAH. YEAH, IT'S FUN.
IT'S FUN.

01:54.567 --> 01:58.100
YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE WORK,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

02:00.633 --> 02:03.267
- HEY, LISTEN, RAY,
FOR MY BIRTHDAY,

02:03.267 --> 02:05.900
I WAS THINKING
WE COULD GO OUT TO MONTAUK,

02:05.900 --> 02:07.367
HAVE BRUNCH,

02:07.367 --> 02:10.600
AND THEN RIDE BIKES
OUT TO THIS OLD LIGHTHOUSE.

02:14.933 --> 02:16.300
- ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?

02:16.300 --> 02:18.100
- YEAH, LOOK HOW GREAT
THIS IS.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.867
- YEAH...

02:19.867 --> 02:21.400
I DON'T KNOW.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.167
I DON'T KNOW,
I WAS PLANNING ON--

02:23.167 --> 02:25.133
ON DOING SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE...

02:25.133 --> 02:27.300
SOMETHING ELSE.

02:27.300 --> 02:28.867
- COME ON.
THIS WOULD BE GREAT.

02:28.867 --> 02:32.000
IT'D BE GREAT TO RIDE BIKES
AND SEE A LIGHTHOUSE.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.433
- DEBRA, HONESTLY.

02:37.433 --> 02:41.700
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS,
YOU KNOW?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.567
NO, 'CAUSE WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A BIG MEAL

02:43.567 --> 02:46.233
AND THEN--
AND THEN RIDE A BIKE?

02:46.233 --> 02:48.567
THAT'S--UH, IT'S
A LITTLE DICEY, YOU KNOW?

02:48.567 --> 02:51.533
YOU'RE GONNA SWERVE, AND--AND
THE FOOD IN YOUR STOMACH

02:51.533 --> 02:54.167
IS GONNA START SLOSHING
FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO SIDE,

02:54.167 --> 02:55.767
AND THEN DOWN YOU GO.

02:55.767 --> 02:58.833
I DON'T WANT YOU
GETTING HURT, OKAY?

02:58.833 --> 03:04.333
[clears throat]
SO THAT'S IT. IT'S SETTLED.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.800
- SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

03:09.800 --> 03:14.033
ARE YOU PLANNING SOMETHING
FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

03:14.033 --> 03:16.533
- NO! WHAT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT, OKAY?

03:16.533 --> 03:22.400
AND I RESENT THIS WHOLE LINE
OF QUESTIONING.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.467
- YOU ARE
PLANNING SOMETHING.

03:25.467 --> 03:29.433
OH, RAY. OH.
YOU ARE SO CUTE.

03:29.433 --> 03:30.967
YOU WANTED TO SURPRISE ME.

03:30.967 --> 03:32.433
- NO.
- [gasps]

03:32.433 --> 03:34.867
ARE YOU THROWING ME
A SURPRISE PARTY?

03:34.867 --> 03:36.067
- NO.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.733
I'M--NO, WHAT ARE YOU--
I JUST--

03:37.733 --> 03:40.667
I DON'T WANT YOUR--YOUR STOMACH
SLOSHING FROM SIDE TO SIDE.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.733
- ALL RIGHT, I WON'T ASK
ANOTHER QUESTION.

03:42.733 --> 03:44.500
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.867
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO KNOW.

03:46.867 --> 03:48.300
- OH...

03:52.867 --> 03:55.667
- WHAT WAS THAT?

03:55.667 --> 03:59.367
- I LOVE SURPRISES.

03:59.367 --> 04:00.700
- YEAH?
- UH-HUH.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.367
- WELL, GO UPSTAIRS.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.500
I'LL SURPRISE
THE HELL OUT OF YOU.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.800
- YEAH?

04:06.800 --> 04:08.667
- YEAH.

04:13.433 --> 04:17.733
- YOU KNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS
WANTED A SURPRISE PARTY.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.000
BUT ONCE I MARRIED YOU,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.167
I FIGURED IT WAS NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN,

04:20.167 --> 04:22.033
THAT YOU WEREN'T
ROMANTIC ENOUGH.

04:22.033 --> 04:24.200
I WAS WRONG.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.667
- I DIDN'T SHOWER TODAY,
BUT I'M STILL--

04:25.667 --> 04:29.033
I'M OKAY,
I'M NOT THAT BAD.

04:29.033 --> 04:31.833
- LISTEN, RAY...

04:31.833 --> 04:34.733
I DON'T WANT TO RUIN IT,
BUT HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?

04:34.733 --> 04:37.467
- TENDERLY, AND THEN MAYBE
NOT QUITE AS TENDERLY,

04:37.467 --> 04:39.267
BUT STILL GOOD.

04:39.267 --> 04:40.633
- NO, THE--THE PARTY.

04:40.633 --> 04:41.967
- OH, WELL...

04:41.967 --> 04:44.533
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I SHOULD
GIVE ANYTHING MORE AWAY.

04:44.533 --> 04:46.267
YOU KNOW, KIND OF KILL
THE WHOLE SURPRISE THING.

04:46.267 --> 04:48.633
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I ALREADY GOT SURPRISED,

04:48.633 --> 04:50.433
SO CAN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
ONE PART OF IT?

04:50.433 --> 04:52.200
- NO, NO, IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A SURPRISE.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.067
I MEAN, I WANT IT
TO BE A SURPRISE.

04:57.333 --> 05:01.433
- CAN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
A LITTLE PART?

05:01.433 --> 05:03.000
- ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S GONNA BE CATERING.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.667
- OOH, CATERING?
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.433
- THAT'S GREAT.
- YEAH, YEAH.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.100
- YEAH.
WHAT KIND OF CATERING?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.500
- I DON'T KNOW YET,

05:10.500 --> 05:11.767
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
SUPER-GREAT CATERING.

05:11.767 --> 05:13.000
LET'S GET GOING.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.800
- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE
REALLY GREAT,

05:14.800 --> 05:16.933
WHAT I
WOULD REALLY LOVE?

05:16.933 --> 05:20.667
A CHINESE BANQUET.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.867
- WHAT?

05:23.867 --> 05:26.667
- YEAH, YOU REMEMBER THAT BOOK
"THE JOY LUCK CLUB"?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.833
THERE WAS THIS BOOK,

05:29.833 --> 05:31.300
"THE JOY LUCK CLUB",

05:31.300 --> 05:33.800
AND IN IT, THEY HAD
THESE FANTASTIC CELEBRATIONS

05:33.800 --> 05:37.167
IN THESE LAVISH BANQUET HALLS
WITH THESE AMAZING MEALS.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.033
- NO, NO, NO.
BUT--BUT--NO, NO.

05:39.033 --> 05:40.867
HEY.

05:40.867 --> 05:44.067
HOW 'BOUT THIS, OKAY?

05:44.067 --> 05:48.067
I'M THINKING,
HOW 'BOUT...

05:48.067 --> 05:53.300
AN ENGLISH TEA PARTY?

05:55.500 --> 05:57.667
- WHAT?

05:57.667 --> 05:59.767
- ENGLISH TEA PARTY.

05:59.767 --> 06:01.433
IT'S--IT'S CLASSY.

06:01.433 --> 06:03.467
- YOU THOUGHT
OF AN ENGLISH TEA PARTY?

06:03.467 --> 06:05.167
- YES, YES. YOU LIKE IT.
IT'S GREAT.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.167
WE'LL HAVE ENGLISH...
MUFFINS,

06:07.167 --> 06:09.700
WE'LL--WE'LL PLAY
THE BEATLES.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.033
WE'LL SPEAK ENGLISH.

06:11.033 --> 06:13.133
[English accent]
'ELLO, SPOT OF TEA, MUM?

06:13.133 --> 06:16.733
A SPOT OF TEA?

06:16.733 --> 06:20.733
- AND--AND YOU REALLY
DON'T LIKE

06:20.733 --> 06:23.067
THE CHINESE BANQUET?

06:23.067 --> 06:25.267
- NO, NO, I DO.
I DON'T THINK--

06:25.267 --> 06:26.767
- YOU WILL LOVE IT.

06:26.767 --> 06:29.600
WE'LL HAVE CHINESE LANTERNS
AND PAPER DRAGONS.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.767
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK WO-HOP CATERS.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.433
I'M GONNA GET THE MENU.

06:33.433 --> 06:34.933
MY MOM IS GONNA LOVE THIS.

06:34.933 --> 06:37.733
DID YOU INVITE MY MOTHER?
DON'T FORGET MY MOTHER.

06:39.467 --> 06:44.033
- GREAT. NOW SHE'S TOO HAPPY
TO HAVE SEX.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.400
- I'M SO GLAD
YOU WANTED TO MEET.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.633
THIS GIVES ME
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

06:52.633 --> 06:55.000
TO SHOW YOU THE EXACT
KIND OF THING

06:55.000 --> 06:56.367
WE'RE DOING
FOR THE PARTY.

06:56.367 --> 06:57.567
ISN'T THIS WONDERFUL?

06:57.567 --> 06:58.633
- HMM, SURE.

06:58.633 --> 06:59.867
- NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, MA'AM.

06:59.867 --> 07:01.233
- OH, HELLO, MARK.

07:01.233 --> 07:03.200
WE'LL HAVE TEA AND SCONES,

07:03.200 --> 07:06.967
AND CUCUMBER
AND WATERCRESS SANDWICHES.

07:06.967 --> 07:08.300
SOUND GOOD?

07:08.300 --> 07:11.333
- ALL MY FAVORITES.

07:11.333 --> 07:12.667
- TEA, MA'AM?

07:12.667 --> 07:14.833
- OH, THANK YOU.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.567
- TEA?

07:16.567 --> 07:18.233
- MM...

07:18.233 --> 07:22.167
I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING IN A LIPTON.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.767
- UH, I'M SORRY, SIR.

07:24.767 --> 07:26.267
- UH...

07:26.267 --> 07:31.200
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY
THE SHAM-O-MILEY.

07:40.133 --> 07:43.367
- WATERCRESS SANDWICH?
THEY'RE YUMMY.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.400
- MMM. YES...YUMMY.

07:56.400 --> 08:01.400
YOU CAN REALLY TASTE
THE WATER.

08:01.400 --> 08:05.033
- I AM DOING THESE
EXACT SANDWICHES FOR THE PARTY

08:05.033 --> 08:06.633
AND THE SAME
TEA SERVICE.

08:06.633 --> 08:08.700
OOH, DEBRA'S GOING
TO BE THRILLED.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.467
[squeals]
- YEAH.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.300
YES. IT'S NICE,
BUT YOU KNOW,

08:12.300 --> 08:14.633
I'M THINKING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO--

08:14.633 --> 08:17.633
MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THINGS
UP A TINY BIT.

08:17.633 --> 08:19.333
- CHANGE WHAT?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.033
- WELL, NOTHING.
NOTHING.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.667
BUT I'M THINKING YOU--YOU
PROBABLY COULD TAKE THE PARTY

08:23.667 --> 08:26.233
IN A LITTLE
DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

08:26.233 --> 08:27.700
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.100
- YOU KNOW, JUST...

08:29.100 --> 08:31.533
TWEAK IT A LITTLE,
YOU KNOW?

08:31.533 --> 08:32.567
LIKE...

08:32.567 --> 08:34.333
LIKE--OKAY,

08:34.333 --> 08:40.267
INSTEAD OF AN ENGLISH TEA PARTY,
YOU DO...

08:40.267 --> 08:46.233
A CHINESE-ISH TEA PARTY.

08:46.233 --> 08:51.100
- BUT...WE DECIDED
ON AN ENGLISH TEA PARTY.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.533
- I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU DID.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.667
BUT THINK HOW AWESOME
CHINESE COULD BE. HUH?

08:55.667 --> 08:58.200
FOR DEBRA, IT WOULD--
LIKE, UH...

08:58.200 --> 09:00.700
AMY BRINGS DEBRA
INTO THE HOUSE, RIGHT?

09:00.700 --> 09:02.033
AND WE'RE ALL THERE,

09:02.033 --> 09:04.000
AND--AND--AND THERE'S--
THERE'S--THERE'S--

09:04.000 --> 09:05.500
I'M JUST SPITBALLING HERE--

09:05.500 --> 09:07.733
THERE'S, UH,
CHINESE LANTERNS

09:07.733 --> 09:10.067
AND--AND PAPER DRAGONS.

09:10.067 --> 09:12.567
AND I HEAR WO-HOP CATERS.

09:12.567 --> 09:14.233
HUH?

09:14.233 --> 09:16.733
- BUT WHY DO WE
HAVE TO CHANGE IT?

09:16.733 --> 09:18.400
- I--BECAUSE I--

09:18.400 --> 09:20.467
I THINK I KNOW DEBRA
VERY WELL.

09:20.467 --> 09:23.800
- WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO,
BUT I DO TOO.

09:23.800 --> 09:28.833
- YES, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE
A CONNECTION TO HER, BUT...

09:28.833 --> 09:31.267
BUT...

09:31.267 --> 09:35.500
YOU KNEW THE GIRL.

09:35.500 --> 09:39.433
I KNOW THE LADY.

09:39.433 --> 09:43.667
AND--AND I THINK THE LADY
WOULD PREFER CHINESE.

09:45.633 --> 09:48.400
- WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME,
RAYMOND?

09:48.400 --> 09:49.967
- WHAT?

09:49.967 --> 09:52.533
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:52.533 --> 09:54.067
I LIKE YOU.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.067
- LET'S BE HONEST.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.933
YOU ARE SO UNCOMFORTABLE
AROUND ME.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.167
YOU NEVER SAY MORE
THAN TWO WORDS.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.567
AND IT SEEMS
WHENEVER WE ARE TOGETHER,

10:03.567 --> 10:07.567
YOU'LL DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
TO GET AWAY FROM ME.

10:07.567 --> 10:11.167
I MEAN, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO THINK?

10:11.167 --> 10:13.067
YOU--YOU DON'T LIKE ME.

10:13.067 --> 10:15.467
YOU DON'T LIKE MY IDEAS.

10:15.467 --> 10:18.167
I JUST...

10:18.167 --> 10:21.767
WISH IT WERE DIFFERENT
BETWEEN US.

10:30.600 --> 10:35.033
- YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE SAYING THIS,

10:35.033 --> 10:36.500
BECAUSE I WAS--

10:36.500 --> 10:42.133
I WAS JUST THINKING
TO MYSELF...

10:42.133 --> 10:47.200
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME?

10:50.500 --> 10:52.267
- WHAT?

10:52.267 --> 10:54.467
- YEAH. I MEAN, UH...

10:54.467 --> 10:57.100
YOU KNOW, YOU SEE
HOW MUCH THOUGHT I PUT

10:57.100 --> 10:58.800
INTO THIS CHINESE IDEA,

10:58.800 --> 11:02.233
AND--AND YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

11:02.233 --> 11:04.267
YOU JUST DISMISS IT
OUT OF HAND.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.267
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU THINK
IT MAKES ME FEEL?

11:06.267 --> 11:09.233
YOU JUST RUSH IN,
AND YOU WANT TO PLAN EVERYTHING,

11:09.233 --> 11:12.300
AND--AND YOU WON'T EVEN LET ME
HAVE ANY SAY

11:12.300 --> 11:18.367
IN MY OWN WIFE'S
SPECIAL DAY.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.500
- RAYMOND, I--

11:24.500 --> 11:27.733
- YOU KNOW, I'VE--
I'VE LOST MY APPETITE.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.867
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

11:35.867 --> 11:39.100
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS MEANT
THAT MUCH TO YOU.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.400
OH, I'M SORRY, RAYMOND.

11:46.633 --> 11:50.300
I THINK YOU'RE
A WONDERFUL SON-IN-LAW.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.233
I MEAN, I COULDN'T HAVE FOUND
A BETTER PERSON

11:53.233 --> 11:57.800
WHO WOULD CARE SO MUCH
FOR MY DAUGHTER.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.067
- THANK YOU.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.633
AND, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

12:02.633 --> 12:07.233
I LIKE YOU.

12:07.233 --> 12:10.667
- I'M SO GLAD WE TALKED.

12:10.667 --> 12:13.433
- YEAH. ME TOO.

12:13.433 --> 12:17.267
SO YOU'LL CHANGE IT ALL
TO CHINESE, RIGHT?

12:20.867 --> 12:23.567
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, RAY.

12:23.567 --> 12:26.867
I MADE A MAI TAI FOR YOU.
- OH, THANK YOU.

12:26.867 --> 12:28.633
HEY, THE PLACE
LOOKS GREAT.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.367
YOU REALLY KNOCKED
YOURSELF OUT.

12:30.367 --> 12:32.867
- IT'LL BE WORTH IT
WHEN I SEE DEBRA'S FACE.

12:32.867 --> 12:35.800
OH, IS SOMEONE LOOKING OUT
FOR AMY AND DEBRA?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.300
- SURE. YEAH.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.967
ROBERT, LOOK OUT
FOR AMY AND DEBRA, ALL RIGHT?

12:39.967 --> 12:42.700
- WHY DO I HAVE
TO BE THE LOOKOUT?

12:42.700 --> 12:46.467
- BECAUSE ANYBODY ELSE
WOULD HAVE TO CLIMB A TREE.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.267
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
HAVING A CHINESE PARTY

12:52.267 --> 12:57.500
AFTER WHAT THOSE PEOPLE
DID TO ME IN KOREA.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.900
- I THINK--I THINK EVERYBODY'S
OVER THAT, DAD.

13:04.900 --> 13:06.533
- NOT ME.

13:06.533 --> 13:09.100
I SPENT A WEEK IN A FOXHOLE
IN THE POURING RAIN.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.233
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.

13:10.233 --> 13:13.000
- I STILL HAVE
TOENAIL FUNGUS.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.900
- FRANK, THAT'S NOT
PARTY TALK.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.533
THOUGH I HAVE
TO SAY, RAYMOND,

13:18.533 --> 13:20.633
THIS THEME
IS SO UNUSUAL.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.100
I HOPE PEOPLE
CAN STILL EAT

13:22.100 --> 13:25.333
WITH ALL
THESE DRAGONS AROUND.

13:25.333 --> 13:29.567
- I DO IT EVERY DAY.

13:32.700 --> 13:33.867
- OH, GOOD.

13:33.867 --> 13:35.367
FRANK, ROBERT,

13:35.367 --> 13:37.233
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE GREAT FUN

13:37.233 --> 13:40.000
IF YOU TWO WOULD BE
MY DANCING DRAGON.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
PUT THIS ON...
AND SEE...

13:45.000 --> 13:46.500
AND WHEN DEBRA COMES IN,

13:46.500 --> 13:51.667
YOU CAN DIP AND SWAY
AROUND THE ROOM IN HER HONOR.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.433
[laughs]

13:58.167 --> 14:01.833
- THAT LADY
IS A FRUIT BAT.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.300
- COME ON, LOOK,
JUST DO THIS.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.500
YOU CAN--YOU CAN BE THE HEAD,

14:04.500 --> 14:05.933
AND, ROBERT,
YOU CAN BE THE TAIL.

14:05.933 --> 14:08.167
- OH, I'M SORRY, RAYMOND.
I'M THE LOOKOUT.

14:08.167 --> 14:09.167
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE

14:09.167 --> 14:13.433
TO BE YOUR DRAGON'S ASS.

14:13.433 --> 14:15.433
- JUST DO THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

14:15.433 --> 14:17.033
COME ON, IT'LL MEAN A LOT
TO DEBRA.

14:17.033 --> 14:18.633
- NO, IT WON'T,
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING

14:18.633 --> 14:20.633
WITH THIS WHOLE
CHINESE THING, ANYWAY?

14:20.633 --> 14:22.067
- YEAH, THIS IS BULL.

14:22.067 --> 14:25.733
I WANT A FORK.

14:25.733 --> 14:29.167
- YEAH, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I KNOW DEBRA PRETTY WELL.

14:29.167 --> 14:32.100
I DON'T THINK SHE'S GONNA GO
FOR YOUR WHOLE LAME THEME.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.300
- YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.767
- OH, YEAH, I DO.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.200
CONFUCIUS SAY,

14:37.200 --> 14:40.333
"WOMAN WITH STUPID HUSBAND
GETS STUPID PARTY."

14:40.333 --> 14:43.200
- [laughs]
- [laughs mockingly]

14:43.200 --> 14:46.333
- 'CAUSE
YOU'RE STUPID.

14:46.333 --> 14:50.000
- "HE WHO MARRY RAYMOND NEED
LOOK ELSEWHERE

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
FOR GOOD TIME."

14:53.000 --> 14:54.600
- [laughs mockingly]

14:54.600 --> 14:56.133
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE STUPID.
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE STUPID.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.367
- YEAH, I'M STUPID.

14:57.367 --> 14:58.667
YEAH, FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
OKAY,

14:58.667 --> 15:00.667
THIS THEME WAS
DEBRA'S IDEA, ALL RIGHT?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.567
- WHAT?

15:02.567 --> 15:04.967
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IT WAS DEBRA'S IDEA?

15:04.967 --> 15:06.633
DEBRA TOLD YOU

15:06.633 --> 15:09.033
TO THROW HER
A SURPRISE PARTY?

15:09.033 --> 15:10.767
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.000
- OH, MY.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.800
I MUST SAY,

15:13.800 --> 15:18.367
DEBRA IS UNBELIEVABLE.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.667
- COME ON, SPILL IT,

15:19.667 --> 15:22.200
OR I'LL STICK A TOE
IN YOUR CAKE.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.333
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.367
SHE KNOWS ABOUT IT, OKAY,
BUT IT WASN'T HER IDEA.

15:26.367 --> 15:30.233
THE CHINESE THING WAS.
SHE LOVES CHINESE.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.933
- DEBRA KNOWS ABOUT
THE SURPRISE, EVERYBODY.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.067
[all groaning]

15:35.067 --> 15:36.333
- SHUSH! SHUSH!

15:36.333 --> 15:37.967
HER MOTHER'S
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

15:37.967 --> 15:40.333
- GOOD. I DON'T HAVE TO YELL
"SURPRISE" LIKE AN IDIOT.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.200
- YES, YOU DO.
- WHY?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.767
- YOU MADE EVERYONE
COME A HALF-HOUR EARLY

15:43.767 --> 15:45.033
AND PARK TWO BLOCKS AWAY?

15:45.033 --> 15:46.567
- YEAH,
WHAT THE HELL?

15:46.567 --> 15:49.233
- OH--YOU LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

15:49.233 --> 15:51.267
- WELL, I'M NOT
YELLING "SURPRISE."

15:51.267 --> 15:53.533
- YOU'RE YELLING "SURPRISE,"
FUNGUS FOOT.

15:53.533 --> 15:56.900
- THEY'RE JUST PULLING
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

15:56.900 --> 15:57.900
THEY'RE HERE.

15:57.900 --> 16:01.367
- EVERYBODY DOWN.

16:01.367 --> 16:03.267
- WE HAVE
TO SQUAT NOW?

16:03.267 --> 16:05.267
- YEAH, GET DOWN
AND GET READY

16:05.267 --> 16:08.533
TO YELL "SURPRISE,"
EVERYBODY.

16:13.133 --> 16:15.700
- SURPRISE!
- SURPRISE...

16:15.700 --> 16:18.667
- SURPRISE.

16:18.667 --> 16:22.733
- OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS ALL OF THIS?

16:22.733 --> 16:24.567
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEBRA.

16:24.567 --> 16:29.400
- OH, MY GOD.
WHAT DID YOU DO?

16:29.400 --> 16:33.333
IS THIS LIKE
A SURPRISE PARTY?

16:33.333 --> 16:36.300
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

16:36.300 --> 16:39.167
- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

16:39.167 --> 16:44.167
IT'S LIKE A--
A CHINESE BANQUET OR SOMETHING.

16:44.167 --> 16:48.333
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS SO AMAZING.

16:48.333 --> 16:52.500
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.767
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS.

16:55.767 --> 16:57.300
AND AMY.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.000
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

16:59.000 --> 17:01.667
WHEN YOU INVITED ME
TO A MUSEUM

17:01.667 --> 17:05.633
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

17:05.633 --> 17:11.100
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO GO OUT TO EAT AFTER.

17:11.100 --> 17:13.633
- I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
A STOMACHACHE.

17:13.633 --> 17:17.467
- WELL--WELL, HI, GUYS.

17:17.467 --> 17:21.000
OH, THIS IS SO INCREDIBLE.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.833
YOU GUYS ARE TOO MUCH.

17:23.833 --> 17:25.800
AND--OH, AND MY MOM
IS HERE.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.833
HI, MOM.

17:28.833 --> 17:34.467
YOU ALL GOT ME.
YOU GOT ME GOOD.

17:34.467 --> 17:40.467
AND WHO THOUGHT...
OF CHINESE?

17:40.467 --> 17:44.600
DO YOU KNOW
THAT I LOVE CHINESE?

17:44.600 --> 17:48.867
- YOU DO?

17:48.867 --> 17:50.933
- I REALLY DO.

17:50.933 --> 17:52.467
OH, RAY.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

17:52.467 --> 17:54.333
- YEAH,
I DON'T KNOW.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.067
- NO, REALLY,
HOW DID YOU KNOW

17:56.067 --> 17:57.400
THAT I LOVE CHINESE?

17:57.400 --> 17:59.133
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT EASY.

17:59.133 --> 18:03.700
- REALLY, HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT I LOVE CHI--

18:13.300 --> 18:17.500
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEBRA.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.500
- YOU TOLD THEM
THAT I KNEW?

18:23.500 --> 18:28.167
- ROBERT WOULDN'T
BE THE DRAGON.

18:28.167 --> 18:30.633
- WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP ME?

18:30.633 --> 18:34.800
- 'CAUSE YOU WERE
VERY GOOD.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.900
- I FELT THAT THE LAST PART
WAS A LITTLE FORCED.

18:38.900 --> 18:44.767
- SO EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT I KNEW ABOUT THE PARTY?

18:44.767 --> 18:48.200
- YOU KNEW
ABOUT THE PARTY?

18:48.200 --> 18:52.600
- NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.133
- YOU KNEW?

18:54.133 --> 18:57.300
- YES, EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT SHE KNEW,

18:57.300 --> 18:59.667
AND NOW SHE KNOWS
THAT YOU ALL KNOW...

18:59.667 --> 19:01.533
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

19:01.533 --> 19:04.000
- WELL, HOW DID YOU
FIND OUT?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.800
- I KNOW.

19:05.800 --> 19:10.800
- LISTEN, EVERYBODY,
UH, THIS IS MY FAULT.

19:10.800 --> 19:14.567
I'M SORRY.
I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.467
WHEN I GOT IT
OUT OF RAYMOND

19:16.467 --> 19:18.433
THAT HE WAS PLANNING
A SURPRISE PARTY,

19:18.433 --> 19:21.933
I KIND OF PUSHED
THE CHINESE IDEA

19:21.933 --> 19:26.667
BECAUSE...I LIKE CHINESE.

19:26.667 --> 19:30.933
SO I'M--I'M SORRY THAT
I WASN'T REALLY SURPRISED,

19:30.933 --> 19:35.133
BUT I'M STILL VERY GRATEFUL
THAT YOU ALL CAME,

19:35.133 --> 19:36.933
AND I'M ESPECIALLY
GRATEFUL TO RAY

19:36.933 --> 19:39.233
'CAUSE OF ALL THE WORK
HE DID.

19:39.233 --> 19:44.000
AND I FEEL VERY LUCKY

19:44.000 --> 19:49.467
BECAUSE I HAVE A HUSBAND
WHO WOULD DO THIS ALL FOR ME.

20:09.600 --> 20:15.600
- DEBRA, I HAVE
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

20:15.600 --> 20:20.500
YOUR MOTHER
HAS NEVER LIKED ME.

20:29.833 --> 20:31.100
SO YOU LIKED THE BIKE RIDE?

20:31.100 --> 20:32.800
- YEAH, IT WAS GREAT.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.167
I THINK YOU COMPLETELY MADE UP
FOR YESTERDAY.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.500
- OH, GOOD.
I'M GLAD.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.867
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I HAD A GOOD TIME TOO.

20:37.867 --> 20:40.367
I-I LIKED THE BRUNCH,
I LIKED THE LIGHTHOUSE,

20:40.367 --> 20:42.200
I EVEN LIKED
THE LITTLE OLD MAN

20:42.200 --> 20:44.233
THAT CHARGED US $20
TO CLIMB 100 STAIRS.

20:44.233 --> 20:46.500
- NOW THAT'S
A GOOD BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.100
- YUP.
AND IT'S NOT OVER YET.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.967
THE ICING ON THE CAKE IS
RIGHT NOW.

20:50.967 --> 20:52.700
YOU GET A BACK RUB.

20:52.700 --> 20:53.800
- RAY.

20:53.800 --> 20:59.167
- WITH ABSOLUTELY
NO EXPECTATIONS FROM ME.

20:59.167 --> 21:03.733
- REALLY?
- THE SURPRISES NEVER END!

21:03.733 --> 21:06.333
- YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
GET THROUGH A BACK RUB

21:06.333 --> 21:08.667
WITHOUT EXPECTING SOMETHING
IN RETURN.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.100
- WELL, IS IT YOUR BIRTHDAY
OR NOT?

21:11.100 --> 21:14.133
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

21:14.133 --> 21:17.733
- ALL RIGHT.
MM-HMM.

21:17.733 --> 21:20.600
MM-HMM.

21:21.867 --> 21:24.100
MM-HMM.

21:29.267 --> 21:31.133
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT,
ARE YOU?

21:31.133 --> 21:34.100
- NO.
- SURPRISE.
