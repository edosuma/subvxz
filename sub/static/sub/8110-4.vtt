THE FRONT DOOR WAS OPEN.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.504
MAYBE YOU LEFT IT

YOU'RE JEALOUS
OF MY NEW CANE,

03:55.836 --> 03:57.338
SO YOU HIRED A NEW DOCTOR

03:57.371 --> 03:59.340
THAT YOU COULD LEAN ON.
EXACTLY.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.842
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT
YOU INSTRUCTED ME TO HIRE ONE.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.845
DR. HOUSE, THIS IS
DR. KELLY BENEDICT,

04:04.878 --> 04:06.514
YOUR NEW FELLOW.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.949
NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.520
UM, I JUST FINISHED
MY PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY

04:12.553 --> 04:13.687
AT ST. JUDE'S.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.523
AND I LOVED STUDYING
THE MIND,

04:15.556 --> 04:17.458
BUT I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE
MORE OF A DIFFERENCE,

04:17.491 --> 04:21.429
OR AT LEAST--
MAN, YOU'RE HOT.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.030
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.

I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.301
SHE LOOKS LIKE CAMERON,
AND HE'S HIRED HER

04:27.335 --> 04:28.369
SOLELY TO SLEEP WITH HER.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.703
NO, NONE OF US WERE
THINKING THAT.

04:29.737 --> 04:30.704
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.706
BUT YOU'D BE
FOOLISHLY WRONG.

04:32.740 --> 04:36.009
YES, HE'S BEEN DATING
AT A NEAR-CLOONEY PACE RECENTLY,

04:36.043 --> 04:37.177
BUT AT THIS POINT,

04:37.210 --> 04:39.747
THE ONLY HOLE HE'S TRYING
TO FILL IS THE ONE IN HIS SOUL,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.315
WHICH MEANS IT'S
THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION

04:41.349 --> 04:42.883
WITH CAMERON
THAT HE MISSES.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.885
DID YOU EVER MARRY
A DYING MAN?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.019
AND IF SO,
DID YOU FREEZE HIS SPERM?

04:46.053 --> 04:48.522
OKAY, SO CAMERON'S
HIS EX.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.890
BUT SPERM...

04:49.923 --> 04:51.992
SHE'S NOT LIKE CAMERON.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.094
THEN WHY'D YOU MAKE HER
WEAR CAMERON'S CLOTHES?

TO FIFTH BASE.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.149
THAT'S TWO HOME RUNS,

06:22.182 --> 06:25.118
AND THEN SHE
GIVES ME BACK A TRIPLE.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.688
I COULD SEE YOU
ON THIS ONE.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.691

IT'S HERS.

INVITE ME?

SHE SAY WHERE SHE WAS WORKING?

THEN SHE WENT STRAIGHT HOME.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.246
THEN WHY'S SHE GOT

ON MONDAY.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.124
I GUESS IT SLIPPED
MY MIND.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.259
AND BREAKING EIGHT RIBS?
THAT SLIP YOUR MIND TOO?

09:19.292 --> 09:21.228
YOU KNOW HOW I WAS
ON THE CYCLING TEAM

09:21.261 --> 09:22.229
WHEN I WAS AT U MASS?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.932
WELL, DURING TRAINING,
I FELL OFF MY BIKE...

09:24.965 --> 09:26.266
RIGHT ONTO A SPRINKLER HEAD.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.968
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

09:28.001 --> 09:29.169
IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.605
I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD BE
RELATED TO MY STOMACH PROBLEMS.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.874
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SEE
THE RECORDS FROM THE OPERATION.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.375
YOU THINK IT IS RELATED?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.144
THE STRANGE STUFF WE FOUND
IN YOUR LIVER,

09:37.177 --> 09:38.812
IT'S PROBABLY
HEPATIC FIBROSIS,

09:38.846 --> 09:39.913
BUT IT COULD ALSO JUST BE
A SCREW-UP FROM THE OLD SURGERY.

09:39.947 --> 09:43.016
THE OPERATION WAS DONE
AT THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.886
HOPEFULLY THEY STILL HAVE
THE RECORDS.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.189
(House)
COME BACK.
JUST ONE MORE TIME.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.258
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.893
MY WRISTS ARE TIRED.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.008
I'VE GOT A MASSAGE
COMING BY IN FIVE.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.343
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT
SHE REALIZED

10:10.377 --> 10:12.045
THE ROMANCE WAS
ALREADY GONE.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.083
HEAD SHOT!

OH...HI.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.131
HI.

10:42.710 --> 10:43.643
I CALLED U MASS.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.013
THERE'S NO RECORD OF
ANY SURGERY FOR MARGARET.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.280
YOU USE HER MAIDEN NAME?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.750
NO. KELLY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT
THE CONCEPT OF MARRIED NAMES.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.785
IT WASN'T COVERED IN HER
PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.354
MARGARET WAS NEVER EVEN
REGISTERED AT THE UNIVERSITY.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.189
CALL THE OTHER HOSPITALS
IN THE AREA.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.995

NO CREDIT HISTORY

11:03.130 --> 11:04.131
UNTIL THREE YEARS AGO.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.999
AND BASED ON HER NUMBER,

11:06.033 --> 11:08.969
SHE WAS BORN AROUND 1945.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.437
SHE STOLE SOMEONE'S

[monitor alarm beeping]

11:31.491 --> 11:33.093
DOROTHY.

11:33.126 --> 11:37.931
DOROTHY, DEAR...
IT'S AUNT EM, DARLING.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.868
WHAT'S--
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.736
(House)
WELL, ON THE ONE HAND,

11:42.770 --> 11:44.905
YOU'VE GOT SOME MYSTERIOUS
HEART AND TUMMY PROBLEMS.

11:44.938 --> 11:48.475
ON THE OTHER, YOU LOOK GREAT
FOR A 65-YEAR-OLD.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.044
SO WHO ARE YOU?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.880
AND, NO, THAT'S NOT
SOME WEIRD

11:52.913 --> 11:54.314
CANADIAN PRONUNCIATION
OF "HOW."

11:54.347 --> 11:57.384
THEY'RE SAYING YOU CHANGED
YOUR IDENTITY.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.953
WHAT ARE THEY
TALKING ABOUT, MARGARET?

11:59.987 --> 12:02.489
I DON'T KNOW.

12:02.522 --> 12:06.059
WELL, THAT FALLS IN THE
OBVIOUSLY STUPID LIE CATEGORY,

12:06.093 --> 12:08.028
WHICH YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH
FROM THE ONE YOU TOLD US

12:08.061 --> 12:09.897
ABOUT YOUR BIKE ACCIDENT.

12:09.930 --> 12:14.201
YOU THOUGHT
WE'D NEVER CHECK?

12:14.234 --> 12:18.939
FIVE YEARS AGO...
I WAS MARRIED.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.074
WHO WAS HE?

12:21.108 --> 12:24.144
JUST A GUY.
I MET HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.946
HE WAS OLDER.

12:25.979 --> 12:31.885
HE...USED TO GET JEALOUS...
DO DRUGS.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.053
THOSE BROKEN BONES?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.222
HE...

12:35.255 --> 12:38.025
HE WOULD TELL ME TO
TAKE OFF ALL MY CLOTHES

12:38.058 --> 12:41.061
SO HE COULD INSPECT ME.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.129
THEN HE WOULD HIT ME.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.832
I GOT A RESTRAINING ORDER,

12:44.865 --> 12:48.936
RAN AWAY,
BUT HE FOUND ME ANYWAY.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.370
THAT'S WHEN HE BROKE
MY RIBS.

12:50.403 --> 12:55.042
SO I MOVED AWAY AGAIN
TO ARIZONA.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.945
CAME BACK FROM WORK
ONE DAY...

12:57.978 --> 13:01.114
HE'D BROKEN IN,
FED PESTICIDES TO MY DOG...

13:01.148 --> 13:02.482
KILLED HER.

13:02.515 --> 13:05.018
I BOUGHT A DEAD WOMAN'S
IDENTITY,

13:05.052 --> 13:08.388
CHANGED MY NAME,
MOVED HERE.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.191
IS THIS RELATED TO WHY YOU WERE
IN TRENTON YESTERDAY?

13:11.224 --> 13:14.928
THERE'S A SUPPORT GROUP
FOR ABUSED WOMEN

13:14.962 --> 13:17.397
AT TRENTON GENERAL.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.466
I GO A LOT.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.469
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS.
I DON'T--

13:22.502 --> 13:24.037
JUST--JUST TELL ME.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.539
CARL.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.375
CARL WHAT?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.077
THIS IS WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.045
'CAUSE YOU GO CONFRONT HIM,
HE'LL KILL YOU.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.281
WELL, I'VE GOT ANOTHER NAME
YOU CAN TELL US INSTEAD.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.548
YOURS.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.387
IT'S JENNY.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.894
NOW, SOME PERSON

13:46.927 --> 13:49.062
SEEMED TO THINK THAT
I WAS NOT BEING FAIR TO YOU

13:49.096 --> 13:50.864
IN OUR LAST DDX

13:50.898 --> 13:52.532
BECAUSE I MADE YOU NERVOUS.

13:52.565 --> 13:56.636
SO THIS TIME,
I'M GONNA PUT YOU AT EASE.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.972
IT'S JUST YOU
AND OLD DOC HOUSE.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.941
A COUPLE OF PALS

14:00.974 --> 14:03.610
CHITTIN' THE CHAT.

14:03.643 --> 14:04.611
(Chase)
WHY NOT JUST PLACE A CHAIR

14:04.644 --> 14:06.947
ABOVE A TRAP DOOR
WITH A SHARK TANK UNDERNEATH?

14:06.980 --> 14:09.917
WEDNESDAY IS WHEN
I GET MY SHARK TANK CLEANED.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.920
ALSO BECAUSE
I'M GIVING HER A CHANCE.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.088
YOU'RE GIVING HER A TEST.
THIS WHOLE JOB IS A TEST.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.623
I'M GIVING HER THE CHANCE
TO FAIL IT SOONER

14:16.656 --> 14:18.258
RATHER THAN LATER.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.927
OR PASS.

14:19.960 --> 14:24.965
ARRHYTHMIA AND ELEVATED LFTs
RULE OUT HEPATIC FIBROSIS.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.067
SO HEART AND STOMACH.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.936
GASTRITIS.
EXPLAINS THE STOMACH,
NOT THE HEART.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.071
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION?
EXPLAINS THE HEART,
NOT THE STOMACH.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.406
SORRY, SORRY. CYSTITIS.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.976
EXPLAINS THE...NOTHING.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.477
I MEANT CHOLECYSTITIS.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.279
IT WOULD HAVE SHOWED UP
ON THE PHYSICAL EXAMINE.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.914
DO WE HAVE TO SIT HERE
ALL DAY?

14:40.948 --> 14:42.315
YOU GOT A BETTER ANSWER THAN
SHE DOES, THEN LET'S HEAR IT.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.584
I'M SURE SHE'S ALREADY
STARTING TO THINK HOW,

14:44.617 --> 14:47.921
IF WE PUT THE SYMPTOMS TOGETHER
WITH THE ABUSIVE EX,

14:47.955 --> 14:53.693
THE FACT THAT SHE'D JUST EATEN,
THE OPEN DOOR...

14:53.726 --> 14:55.495
RHYMES WITH MOISON...

14:55.528 --> 14:57.965
YOU THINK HER EX-HUSBAND
TRIED TO POISON HER?

14:57.998 --> 14:59.967
EVEN IF HE FOUND HER
SOMEHOW,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.002
THESE ABUSERS HAVE
A PATTERN.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.371
HE BEAT HER WITH HIS HANDS.
POISON'S TOO IMPERSONAL.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.106
IT DOESN'T FIT.
EXACTLY.

15:06.139 --> 15:10.077
THE COUNTERARGUMENT
IS WOOF!

15:10.110 --> 15:11.011
HER EX POISONED HER DOG.

15:11.044 --> 15:15.282
OH...RIGHT.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.716
(Foreman)
SHE SAID HE USED PESTICIDES.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.985
HE COULD HAVE STUCK SOME
IN HER DINNER.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.988
TREAT WITH PRALIDOXIME.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.090
"A" FOR EFFORT?

15:30.663 --> 15:31.965
[elevator dings]

15:31.999 --> 15:32.865

TRYING TO COME UP

15:32.899 --> 15:36.970
WITH A COMPLICATED REASON
YOU HIRED KELLY.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.972
THANK YOU.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.974
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.976
YOU THINK SHE'S HOT.
YOU WANT TO SLEEP WITH HER.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.644
[scoffs]

15:44.677 --> 15:45.979
WELL, IT WAS NICE
TO SEE YOU FINALLY

15:46.013 --> 15:47.514
TAKING AN INTEREST
IN MY LIFE.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.615
WE SHOULD GO BOWLING
SOMETIME.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.582
I'M JUST SAYING
IF YOU SPEND

15:49.616 --> 15:51.684
ALL YOUR OFF-WORK TIME
AND ENERGY GETTING LAID,

15:51.718 --> 15:53.486
IT'S GONNA SPILL
INTO YOUR WORK AS WELL.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.588
SHE'S SMART.
YOU DIDN'T INTERVIEW HER.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.724
I DID GLANCE
AT HER RESUME.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.993
MIDDLING GRADES,
MIDDLING MED SCHOOL.

16:00.027 --> 16:03.563
SHE WAS EDITOR FOR RUTGERS'
DAILY UNDERGRAD NEWSPAPER.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.332
THAT SHOWS A LOT MORE GUTS
AND DETERMINATION

16:05.365 --> 16:07.467
THAN MED SCHOOL GRADES.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.636
UH-HUH.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.005
HOW LONG DID YOU
INTERVIEW HER?

16:12.039 --> 16:14.074
45 MINUTES,
AT LEAST.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.744
HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS AFTER
YOU DECIDED TO HIRE HER?

16:17.777 --> 16:20.447
YOU SAW WHAT YOU WANTED
TO SEE.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.685
THIS GUY BROKE INTO
OUR HOUSE?

16:25.718 --> 16:27.320
THAT'S THE THEORY.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.057
I DON'T KNOW,
IT COULD BE TRUE.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.791
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
ABOUT HIM

16:31.824 --> 16:33.426
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
TRUST ME?

16:33.460 --> 16:34.794
I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET INVOLVED.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.065
I'M ALREADY INVOLVED.
WE'RE MARRIED.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.632
IT WAS THE WORST TIME
IN MY LIFE.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.434
I WANTED TO BLOCK IT OUT.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.737
I'M SORRY.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.606
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

16:46.639 --> 16:51.144
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I DON'T KNOW.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.550
HEY...

16:57.584 --> 17:00.153
SO I'M SEEING YOU TONIGHT?

17:00.187 --> 17:02.622
YES. AND YOU WOULD HAVE

17:02.655 --> 17:03.756
EVEN IT YOU HADN'T
TOLD ME THAT.

17:03.790 --> 17:07.260
I WAS JUST WONDERING,
YOUR MASSEUSE...

17:07.294 --> 17:10.063
BRANDI.
I'M SURE I'M IMAGINING THIS,

17:10.097 --> 17:12.399
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT AS SURE
NOW THAT I KNOW HER NAME,

17:12.432 --> 17:15.168
BUT SHE SEEMS A LITTLE...

17:15.202 --> 17:17.070
HOW DO I SAY THIS?
I DON'T KNOW.

17:17.104 --> 17:20.073
UM, A BIT SLUTTY.
SHEA HOOKER.

17:20.107 --> 17:23.343
IF SHE'S NOT SLUTTY,
SHE'S DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.679
WHAT?
DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH HER?

17:26.713 --> 17:29.149
YESTERDAY?

17:29.182 --> 17:31.851
AH, YOU'RE GETTING
CONFUSED BY THE HOOKER THING.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.821
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I'M DATING YOU.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.857
BUT YOU USED TO
HAVE SEX WITH HER.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.860
WELL, IT WAS A MASSAGE

17:40.893 --> 17:42.295
PLUS HAPPY ENDING
SORT OF THING.

17:42.329 --> 17:45.832
NOW IT'S MORE OF
A SAD ENDING.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.301
BECAUSE OF YOU!

17:51.171 --> 17:53.540
I'VE TRIED 15 DIFFERENT
MASSAGE THERAPISTS

17:53.573 --> 17:55.108
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.110
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT SHE'S THE BEST I'VE FOUND.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.878
SHE MAKES MY LEG
FEEL BETTER.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.581
SO YOU REALLY THINK THAT
I WOULD BE OKAY

18:01.614 --> 18:03.616
WITH YOU GETTING A MASSAGE
FROM A HOOKER

18:03.650 --> 18:04.884
YOU USED TO HAVE SEX WITH?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.719
YOU DON'T MIND
THE MASSAGE PART,

18:06.753 --> 18:09.122
YOU MIND THE SEX PART,
WHICH DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.857
I KNOW A GREAT
PHYSICAL THERAPIST.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.226
I WILL GIVE YOU
HER NUMBER.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.328
WHY WOULD I GIVE UP ONE
WHO DEFINITELY WORKS

18:15.362 --> 18:16.463
FOR ONE WHO MIGHT WORK?

18:16.496 --> 18:17.864
BECAUSE I ASKED YOU TO.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.267
THAT'S NOT REALLY
AN ARGUMENT, NOW, IS IT?

18:20.300 --> 18:24.103
I WON'T SEE YOU UNTIL
YOU STOP SEEING HER.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.242
WELL, THAT'S AN ARGUMENT.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.280
HOW'S OUR PATIENT DOING?

18:33.313 --> 18:36.449
WELL, SHE'S STABLE,
BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL

18:36.483 --> 18:39.552
IF THE PRALIDOXIME
IS WORKING.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.520
COME ON, GO HOME.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.555
YOU CAN'T RE-CRAM
ALL OF MED SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.225
I'M FEELING A LOT
OF PRESSURE HERE.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.926
YOU WERE THE EDITOR
OF YOUR SCHOOL PAPER.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.562
I THINK YOU KNOW HOW
TO DEAL WITH PRESSURE.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.931
NO, I WASN'T.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.901
ON YOUR RESUME IT SAID
"RUTGERS DAILY HERALD EDITOR."

18:54.934 --> 18:56.269
DIDN'T IT?

18:56.303 --> 18:57.770
I WASN'T HEAD
OF THE PAPER.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.506
THAT'S CALLED
EDITOR IN CHIEF.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.607
I WAS JUST A WRITER.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.643
WE'RE ALL CALLED EDITORS.
AH.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.812
DID YOU HIRE ME
BECAUSE OF THAT?

19:05.845 --> 19:07.614
NOT ENTIRELY.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.317
LOOK, IF YOU'RE HAVING
BUYER'S REMORSE...

19:10.350 --> 19:12.585
OH, NO, UH, I'M NOT.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.754
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT
VOLUME TWO

19:14.787 --> 19:19.692
ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES.
[pager beeping]

19:19.726 --> 19:21.928
PATIENT'S HUSBAND JUST GOT
ADMITTED TO THE E.R.

19:28.901 --> 19:34.907
LET'S SAY YOU HAD
A REALLY FANTASTIC HANDYMAN...

19:34.941 --> 19:36.943
I WAS HOPING YOU'D
INTERRUPT MY COOKING

19:36.976 --> 19:38.778
TO ASK ABOUT HANDYMEN.

19:38.811 --> 19:39.946
DO GO ON.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.849
WOULD SAM ASK YOU
TO STOP USING HIM

19:42.882 --> 19:44.917
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD
A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP

19:44.951 --> 19:46.486
WITH HIM IN THE PAST?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.988
AH, YES, THE AGE-OLD
HOOKER MASSAGE CONUNDRUM.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.823
CUDDY MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.293
LET'S SAY YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.827
COMPLETELY RIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.095
GIVE IN ANYWAY.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.665
THIS IS NOT A POINT OF PRIDE.
THIS IS A POINT OF PRINCIPLE.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.801
RIGHT, YOU'RE THE ROSA PARKS
OF HOOKER MASSAGES.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.670
THE PRINCIPLE IS
SHE'S BEING IRRATIONAL.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.372
IF I GIVE IN ON THIS,

20:05.405 --> 20:07.274
IT SETS THE STAGE
FOR THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.508
PUTTING UP WITH
IRRATIONALITY

20:08.541 --> 20:10.343
IS THE FOUNDATION
FOR EVERY RELATIONSHIP.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.812
I AGREE WITH SAM WHEN SHE'S
CALLING HER FATHER A MONSTER.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.314
I AGREE WITH HER WHEN
SHE'S CALLING HIM A SAINT.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.015
AND IN EXCHANGE, I GET
TO HAVE SEX WITH HER.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.618
AND I'M SURE SHE HAS
SIMILAR TRADEOFFS WITH ME.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.288
RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SACRIFICES.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.023
SO SACRIFICE BEING CRAZY.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.826
GO GET HER A GIFT
AND APOLOGIZE.

20:26.859 --> 20:30.863
YOU FINALLY MADE A GOOD POINT.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.900
WHICH, CLEARLY,
YOU HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD

20:33.933 --> 20:35.635
BASED ON HOW QUICKLY
YOU AGREED.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.304
THE KITCHEN'S BURNING.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.340
OH...

20:40.373 --> 20:43.310
WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU
THINKING LIKE HOUSE.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.312
THE HUSBAND'S IN THE E.R.
IF HE'S GOT SIMILAR SYMPTOMS,

20:45.345 --> 20:46.879
IT COULD MEAN ENVIRONMENTAL.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.615
WHICH HELPS
ORGANOPHOSPHATE THEORY.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.850
OR MAYBE IT'S AN INFECTION,

20:50.883 --> 20:53.386
WHICH WOULD MEAN
WE WERE WRONG.
EXACTLY.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.788
OR MAYBE HE JUST GOT SICK
WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.557
COINCIDENCE?

20:57.590 --> 20:58.958
YEAH.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.960
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S ONE
BIG PIECE OF ADVICE.

21:00.993 --> 21:04.697
HOUSE DOESN'T BUY
COINCIDENCES.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.633
OKAY, IT'S NOT
ENVIRONMENTAL.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.568
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

21:08.601 --> 21:09.902
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
KICKED YOUR ASS.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.904
WHAT HAPPENED?
I LOOKED IN HER ADDRESS BOOK.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.540
THERE'S A GUY NAMED CARL
IN BROOKLYN.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.807
SHE TOLD YOU TO
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.809
I'M NOT SO GOOD AT FOLLOWING
DIRECTION SOMETIMES.

21:16.843 --> 21:21.814
I FOUND HIM, I GOT ANGRY,
WHICH I ALSO DO SOMETIMES.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.783
HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.685
HE WOULDN'T LET ME IN.
I GOT MORE PISSED...

21:25.718 --> 21:27.019
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M ON THE FLOOR

21:27.053 --> 21:29.356
AND HE'S CALLED THE COPS.
YOU GET ARRESTED?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.991
NO, HE DIDN'T
PRESS CHARGES.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.025
WELL, YOU SHOULD
PRESS CHARGES.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.427
IF HE TRIED
TO POISON HER...

21:34.461 --> 21:35.428
NO, HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW

21:35.462 --> 21:36.896
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.965
HE'S JUST SOME GUY
THAT MARGARET--

21:38.998 --> 21:40.533
DAMN IT, THAT'S
NOT EVEN HER NAME--

21:40.567 --> 21:41.934
JENNY JUST--

21:41.968 --> 21:45.805
SOME GUY THAT JENNY
USED TO WORK WITH.

21:45.838 --> 21:49.942
I WAS STUPID.
I JUST ASSUMED THAT

21:49.976 --> 21:53.446
THE NAME CARL WAS...

21:53.480 --> 21:55.948
I JUST WANTED TO FIND THE GUY
THAT POISONED MY WIFE.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.785
[cell phone ringing]
WHAT'S UP?

22:00.820 --> 22:03.055
PYREXIA.
103 AND RISING.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.458
I'LL BE RIGHT UP.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.894
YOUR WIFE JUST SPIKED
A FEVER.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.862
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

22:09.896 --> 22:11.364
SHE WASN'T POISONED.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.510
(Chase)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:23.543 --> 22:24.777
JUST LETTING YOU ALL SHARE
IN THE JOYS

22:24.811 --> 22:26.913
OF MY LAST TRIP
TO CARLSBAD CAVERNS.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.715
WHICH THE HUSBAND PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE BEATEN UP

22:28.748 --> 22:30.483
IF HE'D FOUND IT
IN THE ADDRESS BOOK.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.752
WOULD YOU MIND STANDING
NEXT TO THE SCREEN?

22:32.785 --> 22:35.388
YEAH, SHE'D LOVE TO BECOME
A TARGET FOR YOUR RIDICULE.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.589
SHE IS NOT READY?

22:36.623 --> 22:38.691
ENDOCARDITIS?
NORMAL EKG.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.060
NO OSLER NODES.
RIGHT, DR. KELLY!

22:41.093 --> 22:42.595
KELLY'S HER FIRST NAME.

22:42.629 --> 22:43.630
WHAT'S YOUR POINT,
DR. ROBERT?

22:43.663 --> 22:45.164
RUN AN ECHO.
I ALREADY DID.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.799
NO VEGETATIONS.
VALVES ARE CLEAR.

22:46.833 --> 22:47.967
SNAPILICIOUS!

22:48.000 --> 22:49.736
BUT AS I ALWAYS LIKE
TO SAY,

22:49.769 --> 22:52.171
IT'S BETTER TO BE A HELPFUL
HELEN THAN A NEGATIVE NELLY.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.173
SO WHILE YOU'RE COOKING UP
SOME IDEAS OF YOUR OWN,

22:54.206 --> 22:57.977
ALLOW ME TO PRESENT THEORY 2.0
OF WHY CHASE HIRED YOU.

22:58.010 --> 23:02.415
DR. KELLY,
MEET YOUR DOPPELGANGER.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.684
OH, NO.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.519
(Chase)
OH, COME ON.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.154
HOUSE...
(Taub)
IS THAT...

23:08.187 --> 23:12.191
THAT'S BABY CHASE AND HIS MOM.
THAT'S ADORABLE!

23:12.224 --> 23:14.694
NEVER MIND THE BABY,
PEEP THE BABE.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.564
NOTE THE CHEEKBONES
AND EYE SHAPE.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.031
THEY DO ACTUALLY
LOOK ALIKE.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.032
(House)
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

23:20.066 --> 23:21.734
CHASE WANTS TO SLEEP
WITH HIS MOM.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.936
BUT WHO WOULDN'T HIT THAT
IF THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT?

23:23.970 --> 23:26.739
IT'S A CLASSIC CASE
OF WHAT FREUD CALLED--
STOP.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.207
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
CHASE'S MOTHER.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.176
YOU'RE WRONG.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE'S WRONG?

23:30.209 --> 23:31.844
IT IS ABOUT YOUR MOM?
NO.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.547
SO IT'S ABOUT...
I'M ASSUMING HE THOUGHT

23:34.581 --> 23:36.215
I'D BE A GOOD MEMBER
OF THE TEAM.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.985
AND ON THAT SUBJECT,
WHAT ABOUT LEGIONNAIRE'S?

23:39.018 --> 23:41.821
TAUB SAID HE SAW A RATTLY
OLD AIR CONDITIONER

23:41.854 --> 23:42.722
IN THE PATIENT'S HOUSE.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.823
I DON'T CARE
IF HE SAW HER LICKING

23:43.856 --> 23:46.626
A PETRI DISH OF BACILLI,
THERE'S NO LUNG INVOLVEMENT.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.760
ALL WE KNOW IS
WE DON'T SEE IT.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.062
DEHYDRATION FROM THE FEVER
COULD HIDE THE PNEUMONIA.

23:50.096 --> 23:53.700
OKAY, FORGET
THE MOM THEORY.

23:53.733 --> 23:57.236
NOW WATER THE PATIENT,
TREAT FOR LEGIONNAIRE'S.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.605
(Foreman)
HEY, TAUB.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.007
YOU DIDN'T WRITE UP
THE AC SYSTEM.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.742
DID YOU MENTION IT TO KELLY?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.243
NO.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.845
DID YOU MENTION IT
TO CHASE?

24:05.878 --> 24:08.548
YEAH.

24:08.581 --> 24:11.751
WHOSE IDEA WAS LEGIONNAIRE'S?

24:11.784 --> 24:13.920
DR. CHASE'S.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.523
WELL, YOU GET MAJOR POINTS
FOR TRYING TO TRICK ME.

24:16.556 --> 24:19.992
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU LOSE 'EM
ALL FOR FAILING.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.529
HOLD THAT. HOLD THAT.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.663
SEE, NOW YOU'RE FROWNING.

24:23.696 --> 24:24.964
YOU CAN REALLY SEE
THE RESEMBLANCE.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.201
SO WHO GIVES A CRAP
IF I PREPPED HER?

24:29.235 --> 24:32.271
UH, HOUSE. AND THAT'S JUST
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.506
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

24:33.540 --> 24:34.741
YOU TRYING TO
MAKE ME LOOK BAD

24:34.774 --> 24:36.543
SO YOU LOOK BETTER...
OR YOU DON'T LIKE HER,

24:36.576 --> 24:37.910
OR YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME?

24:37.944 --> 24:40.613
WHAT?
WE HIRE SOMEONE
UNQUALIFIED,

24:40.647 --> 24:42.048
IT'S JUST DEAD WEIGHT
WE'LL ALL BE PULLING.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.983
ME ESPECIALLY.
YOU ESPECIALLY WHY?

24:44.016 --> 24:45.852
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY?
BECAUSE I'M--
YOU'RE WHAT?

24:45.885 --> 24:47.654
YOU'RE MY BOSS
OR SOMETHING?

24:47.687 --> 24:49.155
SOMETHING LIKE.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.123
SO THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.959
YOU'RE ANGRY THAT HOUSE
GAVE ME THE CHANCE

24:52.992 --> 24:54.561
TO HIRE SOMEONE
BECAUSE YOU STILL THINK

24:54.594 --> 24:55.595
YOU'RE AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL
TO EVERYONE ELSE.

24:55.628 --> 24:58.064
THAT'S JUST PATHETIC.
I AM AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.166
WHICH IS REFLECTED
IN WHAT, EXACTLY?

25:00.199 --> 25:02.802
YOUR TITLE? NO.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.572
YOUR SALARY?
NOT REALLY.

25:05.605 --> 25:06.673
YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES?

25:06.706 --> 25:09.542
HARDLY.
YOUR ATTITUDE?

25:09.576 --> 25:10.743
AH.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.779
I THINK WE FINALLY
FOUND IT.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.614
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT YOU MADE A BAD DECISION

25:14.647 --> 25:15.782
BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO GET LAID.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.817
OR THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
COURAGEOUSLY PICKING ON KELLY

25:17.850 --> 25:19.051
BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED
TO TAKE ON HOUSE.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.153
CONGRATULATIONS.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.890
YOU'RE A REAL LEADER.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.833
[typing on keyboard]

25:33.866 --> 25:36.202
[door opens]

25:38.638 --> 25:40.707
[thick Latin accent]
I AM FELIPE.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.775
OH, YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.911
DR. HOUSE WAS WORRIED
HOW YOU LEFT THINGS.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.913
HE'S GIVING YOU
A MASSAGE.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.215
AS AN ADMISSION
HE WAS WRONG?
YES.

25:49.248 --> 25:52.719
WELL, TELL HIM THANKS,
BUT I HAVE A MEETING

25:52.752 --> 25:54.621
WITH DR. SCHATZ
IN 20 MINUTES.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.589
HE SAYS YOU WOULD SAY THAT,

25:56.623 --> 25:57.957
AND TO SAY NO, YOU DON'T.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.860
WELL, TELL HIM NE NEEDS TO
STOP CANCELING MY APPOINTMENTS,

26:00.893 --> 26:02.929
BECAUSE I WILL JUST
RESCHEDULE THEM.

26:02.962 --> 26:08.601
HE SAYS YOU WOULD SAY THAT,
AND TO SAY...UH...

26:10.236 --> 26:14.807
THAT "DR. SCHATZ IS A FAT,
LONELY MORON WHO,

26:14.841 --> 26:18.678
"IN AN EFFORT TO HAVE CONTACT
WITH HUMAN FEMALE,

26:18.711 --> 26:20.780
"MAKES THE SAME
EXACT COMPLAINT

26:20.813 --> 26:22.815
"ABOUT PARKING SPACES
EVERY MONTH.

26:22.849 --> 26:28.821
AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO
STOP ENABLING HIM."

26:28.855 --> 26:32.591
I HAVE GREAT FINGERS.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.799
[sighs]

26:39.832 --> 26:42.001
THAT'S SO NICE.

26:42.034 --> 26:46.372
THANK YOU.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.808
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
A MASSEUR?

26:48.841 --> 26:52.144
WHAT IS THAT...
"MASSEUR"?

26:52.178 --> 26:54.714
A MASSAGE THERAPIST.

26:54.747 --> 27:00.186
OH, NO, NOT LONG.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.188
HOW DID MY BOYFRIEND
FIND YOU?

27:02.221 --> 27:06.158
BOYFRIEND?
DR. HOUSE.

27:06.192 --> 27:09.662
HE IS YOUR BOYFRIEND?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.998
WHY IS THAT SURPRISING?

27:12.031 --> 27:15.702
I JUST MEAN,
IF HE FOUND ME,

27:15.735 --> 27:18.304
I DO NOT THINK HE'S GOT
NO GIRLFRIEND.

27:18.337 --> 27:21.841
ARE YOU A PROSTITUTE?

27:21.874 --> 27:23.710
ARE YOU A COP?

27:23.743 --> 27:28.114
[whispering]
THEN NO.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.215
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.458
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU SMOKED.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.760
I DON'T.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.833
I DON'T MIND
SCREWING UP.

27:46.866 --> 27:47.834
I'VE SCREWED UP
IN MY LIFE,

27:47.867 --> 27:49.001
AND I'VE GOTTEN OVER IT.

27:49.035 --> 27:51.037
BUT I'M NOT A CHEATER,
AND I'M NOT A LIAR.

27:51.070 --> 27:54.106
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE BOTH.

27:54.140 --> 27:58.811
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.813
YOU WORK WITH HOUSE
AND YOU KIND OF GET

28:00.847 --> 28:02.281
A MESSED-UP PERSPECTIVE
OF WHAT'S PERMISSIBLE

28:02.314 --> 28:03.282
IN THE WORKPLACE.

28:03.315 --> 28:06.819
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST QUIT.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.454
NO. YOU'RE SMART.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.422
YOU'RE HARD-WORKING.

28:10.456 --> 28:13.159
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT LIKE
YOU GUYS.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.828
USE WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.930
A LOT OF THIS JOB IS
READING PEOPLE,

28:17.964 --> 28:19.231
DEALING WITH THEM.

28:19.265 --> 28:22.468
YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST...
USE YOUR SKILLS.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.187
ARE YOU OKAY?

28:41.220 --> 28:44.523
I CHECKED WITH
TRENTON GENERAL.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.126
THERE'S NO SUPPORT GROUP
FOR ABUSED WOMEN.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.961
MAYBE IT WAS JUST--

28:48.995 --> 28:51.998
IF SHE WAS LYING ABOUT THAT,
WHAT ELSE IS SHE LYING ABOUT?

28:52.031 --> 28:54.133
I MEAN, MAYBE SHE WASN'T
EVEN ABUSED.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.069
MAYBE SHE'S A CRIMINAL.
WHO THE HELL KNOWS?

28:57.103 --> 28:59.505
YOU DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S THE POINT.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.240
THE WAY SHE'S ACTING,

29:01.273 --> 29:03.009
THAT'S THE WAY
ABUSE VICTIMS ACT.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.543
THEIR PERSONALITIES
ARE AFFECTED

29:04.576 --> 29:06.378
BY WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.514
THEY FIND COPING MECHANISMS.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.850
I GOTTA TALK TO HER
ABOUT THIS TRENTON THING.

29:10.883 --> 29:14.120
IF YOU WAKE HER UP,
MAKE HER FEEL DEFENSIVE,

29:14.153 --> 29:15.387
IT'LL GO BAD.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.189
SHE DOESN'T NEED
ANY MORE HOSTILITY

29:17.223 --> 29:19.125
OR AGGRESSION IN HER LIFE.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.864
OKAY.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.902
SERIOUSLY?

29:29.936 --> 29:32.538
A MASSAGE
FROM A MALE HOOKER?

29:32.571 --> 29:36.909
HE WAS? HUH.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.978
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER ME
AT ALL.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.813
I GUESS WE BOTH LEARNED
A VALUABLE LESSON.

29:40.847 --> 29:45.351
EXCEPT THAT I DIDN'T USED
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM, YOU IDIOT!

29:45.384 --> 29:48.520
PLUS, HE WAS A GAY HOOKER.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.322
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS

29:50.356 --> 29:51.824
TO FIND A STRAIGHT
MALE HOOKER?

29:51.858 --> 29:54.827
OH, COME ON.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.562
IT'S A MASSAGE.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.530
I DON'T CARE
WHO GIVES IT TO YOU.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.900
WHY NOT TREAT ME
THE SAME WAY?

30:00.933 --> 30:03.302
I'M SURE THAT
SOME PART OF YOU

30:03.335 --> 30:04.904
BELIEVES THIS IDIOCY.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.907
BUT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
BE STUPID ENOUGH

30:07.940 --> 30:10.176
TO THINK THAT YOU CAN CONVINCE
ANY PART OF ME.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.211
AND THAT CAN ONLY MEAN

30:12.244 --> 30:15.481
YOU'RE TRYING TO SABOTAGE
THIS RELATIONSHIP.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.885
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

30:18.918 --> 30:20.186
WE'RE DOING FINE.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.889
BECAUSE THE NEXT STEP
FROM FINE IS SERIOUS,

30:22.922 --> 30:24.156
AND YOU CAN'T HANDLE THAT,

30:24.190 --> 30:25.591
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP ME
AT ARM'S LENGTH

30:25.624 --> 30:27.093
WITH ALL THIS CRAP.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.429
HOW ABOUT YOU?

30:30.462 --> 30:33.065
I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY
OPEN WITH YOU.

30:33.099 --> 30:36.468
YOU WON'T LET ME
SLEEP OVER.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.370
YOU BASICALLY HAVEN'T
INTRODUCED ME TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.572
BUT DO YOU WANT TO
SPEND TIME WITH HER?

30:40.606 --> 30:46.078
HONESTLY...BEFORE THIS,
I'D HAVE SAID NO.

30:46.112 --> 30:49.281
BUT...YEAH.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.017
HOW ARE WE EVER
GONNA BE A COUPLE

30:51.050 --> 30:53.219
IF YOU KEEP HIDING HER
FROM ME?

30:53.252 --> 30:56.655
HOUSE...

30:56.688 --> 31:00.626
I NEED TO PROTECT HER.

31:00.659 --> 31:04.630
I LET YOU INTO HER LIFE,
AND YOU GO AWAY...

31:06.632 --> 31:11.303
CALL IT WHAT IT IS.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.605
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S HOLDING BACK.

31:20.646 --> 31:24.917
HEY, BABY.

31:24.951 --> 31:27.519
I AM NOT GETTING MAD.

31:27.553 --> 31:31.590
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND YOU HERE.

31:31.623 --> 31:35.361
THERE'S NO MEETING
LIKE YOU TALKED ABOUT

31:35.394 --> 31:36.462
AT TRENTON GENERAL.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.663
YOU SEE, IT TURNS OUT THAT--

31:37.696 --> 31:39.498
IT TURNS OUT--
THE TURNOUT--

31:39.531 --> 31:42.401
THE TURNOUT...
IT'S BEEN TURNED...

31:42.434 --> 31:44.170
TURN--TURNING...
WHAT?

31:44.203 --> 31:46.138
IT'S TURNING--
HEY...

31:46.172 --> 31:48.540
THE TURNOUT--
THE TURNOUT IS TURNING...

31:57.416 --> 32:00.352
YOU'RE GOING TO BURN.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.525
[breathing erratically]

32:06.558 --> 32:10.396
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER?

32:36.088 --> 32:39.591
(House)
IT'S HIT HER BRAIN,
WHATEVER IT IS.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.761
OPACITY IN THE LEFT
TEMPORAL LOBE.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.596
IT COULD BE NOTHING.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.265
WHICH WOULD
GET US NOWHERE.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.267
SO LET'S ASSUME
IT'S SOMETHING.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.269
WHAT KIND OF SOMETHING?
ABSCESS.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.072
OR LYMPHOMA,
OR WEGENERS.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.106
WE'D HAVE TO BIOPSY IT
TO BE SURE.

32:54.140 --> 32:57.176
ANY OF THEM COULD EXPLAIN
ALL OF THE SYMPTOMS.

32:57.209 --> 33:01.780
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ASSUMING
EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.783
BECAUSE IT PROBABLY IS.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.618
BUT HER DELUSIONS
ARE CONSISTENT

33:06.652 --> 33:08.154
WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.556
BIPOLAR DISEASE, FOR EXAMPLE.
SHE'S 30.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.458
IT COULD HE HITTING HER
RIGHT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.160
SO HER MIND JUST HAPPENS
TO FALL APART

33:14.193 --> 33:15.394
RIGHT AFTER HER BODY?

33:15.427 --> 33:17.196
WOW, I THOUGHT I WAS
HAVING A BAD WEEK.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.298
I KNOW IT SOUNDS COINCIDENTAL...

33:19.331 --> 33:21.433
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M BACK
TO THE CAMERON THEORY.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.135
THAT YOU HIRED
THE DUMB VERSION OF CAMERON

33:23.169 --> 33:24.636
SO THAT YOU COULD FIRE HER
AND GET REVENGE.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.605
GIVE HER A BREAK.

33:26.638 --> 33:29.108
OH, YOU'VE SWITCHED SIDES?
LET ME GUESS,

33:29.141 --> 33:31.710
CHASE REPRESENTS
THE DUMB VERSION OF THIRTEEN...

33:31.743 --> 33:34.080
I REALIZED IF WE ALL
JUST KEEP PRESSURING KELLY,

33:34.113 --> 33:35.714
OF COURSE SHE'S GONNA
GET STUFF WRONG.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.150
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE OF ME
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

33:38.184 --> 33:42.354
YOU ARE A TRUE LEADER
OF MEN.

33:42.388 --> 33:43.455
GET SOMEONE TO CUT
INTO HER HEAD

33:43.489 --> 33:44.490
AND GET ME A BIOPSY.

33:50.429 --> 33:54.300
[drill whirring]

34:03.209 --> 34:05.444
CHASE...

34:05.477 --> 34:07.713
JUST SAY "HOLD ON"
NEXT TIME!

34:07.746 --> 34:09.748
HER TEMPERATURE'S NORMAL.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.750
SO WHAT. SHE WAS ON
THE COOLING BLANKET.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.452
WE TOOK HER OFF
AN HOUR AGO.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.487
SHE SHOULD BE FEBRILE
AGAIN.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.858
TELL HOUSE ONE
OF THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS

34:19.891 --> 34:21.727
JUST DISAPPEARED.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.164
(Taub)
COULD IT BE LEGIONNAIRE'S,
AND OUR TREATMENT WORKED?

34:25.197 --> 34:26.332
I WISH, BUT NO.
WE'VE BEEN HYDRATING HER,

34:26.365 --> 34:28.200
AND THERE'S STILL
NO LUNG INVOLVEMENT.

34:28.234 --> 34:29.768
SO RELAPSING,
REMITTING FEVER.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.237
MALARIA.
DENGUE.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.571
(House)
WHY WASN'T SHE FROZEN?

34:32.604 --> 34:35.374
THIS MORNING?

34:35.407 --> 34:37.543
PUT A HEALTHY PERSON
ON A COOLING BLANKET,

34:37.576 --> 34:39.311
THEY'D BE CHILLED
LIKE A FINE CHARDONNAY.

34:39.345 --> 34:42.181
SHE'S A NICE WARM MERLOT.
98.6 ALL DAY.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.183
I DIDN'T WANT HER TO FREEZE.

34:44.216 --> 34:45.851
SO YOU TITRATED THE BLANKET.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.487
AS HER FEVER DROPPED,
YOU LOWERED THE POWER.
EXACTLY.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.890
SO IT'S BEEN ON
THE LOWEST SETTING SINCE WHEN?

34:51.923 --> 34:53.725
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
WHICH MEANS
WE COULD HAVE KNOWN

34:53.759 --> 34:57.663
THAT HER FEVER WAS GONE
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.265
(Taub)
THE FEVER WAS BRIEF.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.333
SOUNDS LIKE A REACTION
TO THE MEDICATION...

35:01.367 --> 35:03.869
THE ANTIBIOTICS.
WITHOUT VOMITING?

35:03.902 --> 35:05.171
WHEN DID SHE LAST PUKE?

35:05.204 --> 35:08.207
NOT SINCE
SHE WAS ADMITTED.

35:09.641 --> 35:10.709
TWO DOWN.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.281
SHOOTING FOR THREE.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.154
(Benedict)
YOU'RE GONNA TURN
HER PACEMAKER OFF?

35:22.188 --> 35:23.922
YOU SURE THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA?

35:23.955 --> 35:27.726
NOPE. BUT IT MIGHT BE.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.935
NO TACHYCARDIA.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.604
THERE'S ONLY
THE DELUSIONS LEFT.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.771
IF THEY'RE EVEN STILL THERE.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.274
MAYBE IT IS
A BIPOLAR DISORDER.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.609
SHE'S FEMALE, SHE'S 30--

35:43.642 --> 35:45.944
IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.
YOU'VE GOTTA STOP DOING THIS.

35:45.977 --> 35:49.648
BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN PROMPTED
BY THE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS.

35:53.819 --> 35:57.256
YOU COULDN'T BE MORE WRONG.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.957
YOU'VE GOT THE CAUSE
AND EFFECT BACKWARDS.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.727
START HER ON HALOPERIODOL
AND LORAZEPAM.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.829
GIVE IT A FEW HOURS
TO TAKE EFFECT.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.465
CALL ME WHEN SHE WAKES.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.641
STILL HALLUCINATING.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.345
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

36:23.249 --> 36:24.616
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

36:24.650 --> 36:27.219
THE TABLE, IT'S ON FIRE.

36:27.253 --> 36:30.622
IF IT WAS, THINK I'D
BE ABLE TO DO THIS...

36:30.656 --> 36:32.991
WITHOUT SCREAMING
FOR MY MOMMY?

36:33.024 --> 36:34.793
THANK YOU.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.796
DON'T BE TOO IMPRESSED.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.365
IT'S MOSTLY THE HAPPY PILLS
YOU PUT HER ON.

36:39.398 --> 36:42.268
BUT SHE CAN TALK
TO US NOW.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.603
THE OBVIOUSLY STUPID LIE
YOU TOLD US

36:44.636 --> 36:46.004
ABOUT YOUR HOSPITAL RECORDS,

36:46.037 --> 36:49.841
IT TURNS OUT TO HAVE BEEN
UN-OBVIOUSLY UN-STUPID.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.610
YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T
GET CAUGHT

36:51.643 --> 36:53.945
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THAT
YOU'D BE CURED AND BACK HOME

36:53.979 --> 36:56.615
BY THE TIME WE SPOKE
TO THE OTHER HOSPITAL.

36:56.648 --> 37:00.452
BECAUSE YOU KNEW
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH YOU.

37:00.486 --> 37:02.621
YOUR DOCTOR WAS TREATING YOU
WITH RISPERIDONE, RIGHT?

37:02.654 --> 37:04.690
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE
IN TRENTON.

37:04.723 --> 37:05.991
YOU GOT THE STOMACH PAIN,
YOU WENT TO SEE HIM,

37:06.024 --> 37:07.459
HE WANTED YOU
TO TAPER OFF.

37:07.493 --> 37:10.262
HER DOCTOR'S NOT IN TRENTON.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.630
NOT THE ONE YOU KNOW ABOUT.

37:11.663 --> 37:15.033
IF YOU HAVEN'T
FIGURED IT OUT BY NOW,

37:15.066 --> 37:16.602
YOUR WIFE HAS A SECRET.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.637
WHAT THE HELL IS HE
TALKING ABOUT?

37:18.670 --> 37:20.472
IS IT ABOUT YOUR EX?

37:20.506 --> 37:23.542
THE EX WAS NOT SO MUCH
A SECRET, MORE OF A LIE.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.744
YOU WEREN'T MARRIED
BEFORE, WERE YOU?

37:25.777 --> 37:27.513
I'M SORRY.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.615
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.517
KNOW--KNOW ABOUT WHAT?

37:31.550 --> 37:33.018
(House)
SHE'S SICK.

37:33.051 --> 37:36.688
SHE'S BEEN SICK FOR YEARS.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.690
MAYBE IT PUT YOU
ON THE STREETS.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.626
MAYBE THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT
THE BROKEN BONES.

37:40.659 --> 37:43.629
SHE'S ONLY SUFFERING
FROM ONE CONDITION.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.864
EVERYTHING ELSE IS
SIDE EFFECTS

37:45.897 --> 37:47.032
OF THE DRUG THAT WAS
TREATING IT.

37:47.065 --> 37:50.302
SHE STOPPED TAKING THE DRUG,
THE SIDE-EFFECTS FADED.

37:50.336 --> 37:55.507
BUT THE UNDERLYING DISEASE
IS STILL THERE.

37:55.541 --> 37:58.344
WHY DON'T YOU TELL
YOUR HUSBAND.

38:03.715 --> 38:09.721
BILLY...
I'M SCHIZOPHRENIC.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.365
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING

38:19.398 --> 38:21.032
THAT A RECENT
PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENT

38:21.066 --> 38:23.735
MIGHT HAVE FIGURED OUT.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.945
WHAT THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

38:33.979 --> 38:35.881
NOTHING.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.649
HER PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS
ARE GONE.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.385
WE'LL PUT HER ON A DIFFERENT
ANTI-PSYCHOTIC

38:39.418 --> 38:40.486
FOR THE MENTAL ONES.

38:40.519 --> 38:43.021
YOU CAN TAKE A NAP.
THIS IS NOT
WHO I MARRIED.

38:43.054 --> 38:46.792
OF COURSE SHE IS.
YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.094
I DON'T KNOW IF
I CAN STAY WITH HER.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.530
SORRY, AS YOUR
MARRIAGE COUNSELOR,

38:51.563 --> 38:53.799
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO YOU
WITHOUT YOUR WIFE PRESENT.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.001
JUST--JUST TELL ME
HOW HARD IT WOULD BE

38:56.034 --> 38:58.136
FOR US TO HANDLE THIS.
MEDICALLY.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.071
LOOK, IF YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU A REASON

39:00.105 --> 39:03.108
TO LEAVE HER, FINE.

39:03.141 --> 39:03.975
APPARENTLY YOU HAVEN'T
NOTICED,

39:04.009 --> 39:05.944
BUT SHE'S GOT A SERIOUS
MENTAL ILLNESS.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.780
IT'S TOO HARD.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.053
IT'S ALWAYS HARD.

39:29.901 --> 39:33.805
OKAY, SO I MADE
A MISTAKE.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.807
KELLY WILL MAKE
A FINE DOCTOR,

39:35.841 --> 39:38.810
BUT SHE'S NOT READY
FOR THE TEAM.

39:38.844 --> 39:41.813
UP TO YOU.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.816
WHAT?
YOU LIKE HER NOW?

39:44.850 --> 39:47.519
NOPE. BUT SHE GOT ME
TO THE RIGHT ANSWER,

39:47.553 --> 39:49.120
WHICH NONE OF THE REST
OF YOU DID.

39:49.154 --> 39:52.824
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE HER
ANOTHER SHOT, GO FOR IT.

39:52.858 --> 39:56.061
OKAY. I WILL.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.062
GREAT.

39:57.095 --> 39:59.998
IT'LL MAKE IT EASIER
FOR YOU TO SLEEP WITH HER.

40:01.066 --> 40:04.069
COME ON, WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
HAVE HIRED HER?

40:04.102 --> 40:05.771
THAT'S NOT WHY
I HIRED HER!

40:21.219 --> 40:24.523
* AT THE END
OF A LONG, LONG DAY *

40:24.556 --> 40:27.659
*

40:27.693 --> 40:32.664
* COME GO WITH ME
IN THE BLUE AND THE GRAY *

40:32.698 --> 40:34.466
* THERE'S NO UP
THERE'S NO DOWN *

40:34.500 --> 40:38.103
* AND THERE'S NO WAY AROUND

40:38.136 --> 40:40.472
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:40.506 --> 40:42.741
I GOT BORED WITH THE PORN
ON MY COMPUTER.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.543
YOU GOT ANY GIRL ON GIRL

40:44.576 --> 40:49.815
ON GIRL ON VIBRATING OBJECT
ON GIRL STUFF?

40:49.848 --> 40:51.883
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS
IF YOU GAVE ME THE NAME

40:51.917 --> 40:53.819
OF THAT PHYSICAL THERAPIST
YOU LIKE.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.955
YOU DONE WITH BRANDI?

40:56.988 --> 41:00.025
EHH...KNOBBY HANDS.

41:00.058 --> 41:03.161
I WILL GET YOU THE NAME.

41:06.231 --> 41:07.799
LET'S STAY AT MY PLACE
TONIGHT, OKAY?

41:07.833 --> 41:10.235
WILL YOU GET CABLE?
NO.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.970
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE
MORE SEX.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.840
OKAY.

41:14.873 --> 41:18.710
* WHEN THE WELL RUNS DRY

41:18.744 --> 41:21.980
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:22.013 --> 41:24.583
QUITTING BEFORE HOUSE
FIRES ME.

41:24.616 --> 41:26.184
HOLD ON.

41:26.217 --> 41:29.855
WE BOTH KNOW HE IS.

41:29.888 --> 41:32.190
BUT MAYBE THERE'S
A BRIGHT SIDE.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.526
WHAT?

41:34.560 --> 41:38.597
YOU REALLY LOOKED OUT
FOR ME.

41:38.630 --> 41:41.199
YOU SEEM LIKE
A REALLY GOOD GUY.

41:41.232 --> 41:43.702
AND...

41:43.735 --> 41:47.138
I NEVER DATE ANYBODY
WHO I WORK WITH.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.808
BUT...

41:49.841 --> 41:52.878
YEAH...

41:52.911 --> 41:57.649
SORRY IT DIDN'T
WORK OUT.

41:57.683 --> 42:00.251
YOU WANT TO GET DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT?

42:00.285 --> 42:04.089
* SEE THE SUNLIGHT COMBED
ON THE SHAPES AT THE FREIGHT *

42:04.122 --> 42:07.659
*

42:07.693 --> 42:11.963
* AT THE END OF THE DAY

42:11.997 --> 42:15.066
* GONNA GET BY

42:15.100 --> 42:16.968
* GONNA GET THROUGH

42:17.002 --> 42:19.204
YOU WANT SOME MORE MEAT?

42:19.237 --> 42:22.307
THIS IS MEAT?

42:22.340 --> 42:25.076
YES, PLEASE.

42:30.982 --> 42:33.051
* THERE'S NO UP
THERE'S NO DOWN *

42:33.084 --> 42:35.253
* AND THERE'S NO WAY AROUND

42:35.286 --> 42:37.222
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

42:37.255 --> 42:38.957
COME ON, KID.
COME ON, COME ON.

42:38.990 --> 42:42.327
COME ON. COME ON.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.062
