06:43.268 --> 06:47.568
<i>The drivers are all on the grid now, and</i>
<i>the Monaco Grand Prix is about to start.</i>

06:47.739 --> 06:51.140
<i>There's Scott Stoddard</i>
<i>with his Jordan BRM.</i>

06:51.343 --> 06:55.643
<i>And with him now, is Jeff Jordan himself,</i>
<i>talking to this brilliant English driver...</i>

06:55.814 --> 06:58.544
<i>who's won so many races</i>
<i>in the dark-green BRMs.</i>

06:58.717 --> 07:03.086
<i>Even faster than Stoddard in practice,</i>
<i>was the Frenchman, Jean-Pierre Sarti.</i>

07:03.255 --> 07:08.090
<i>Twice world champion, an absolute master</i>
<i>of these twisting Monte Carlo streets...</i>

07:08.260 --> 07:10.626
<i>he's won the Grand Prix here</i>
<i>three times.</i>

07:10.795 --> 07:13.593
<i>He drives for the great Italian manufacturer,</i>
<i>Ferrari.</i>

07:14.099 --> 07:19.503
<i>And his team-mate is the young Sicilian, Nino Barlini,</i>
<i>who's also won a place on the front row.</i>

07:19.671 --> 07:22.037
<i>Barlini's the former world champion</i>
<i>motorcyclist...</i>

07:22.374 --> 07:25.275
<i>who made a very successful switch</i>
<i>to car racing last year...</i>

07:25.443 --> 07:29.140
<i>and is certainly a potential</i>
<i>world champion in Formula 1 racing.</i>

07:30.649 --> 07:34.380
<i>On the second row, is Pete Aron,</i>
<i>the American, now driving for BRM.</i>

07:34.553 --> 07:38.114
<i>Pete hasn't won a Grand Prix since</i>
<i>he left Ferrari three seasons ago.</i>

07:38.290 --> 07:42.954
<i>But in spite of two bad accidents last year,</i>
<i>he's still just as fast as ever.</i>

07:43.128 --> 07:45.961
<i>Yesterday he lapped only a tenth slower</i>
<i>than Scott Stoddard...</i>

07:46.131 --> 07:48.725
<i>number one driver in the BRM team.</i>

07:49.935 --> 07:54.531
Let's try get the season
off to a good start. Shall we?

07:54.706 --> 08:00.201
Drive the car, don't try
to stand it on its bloody ear.

08:01.780 --> 08:06.808
<i>Tim Randolph, another American, driving</i>
<i>a Japanese Yamura, he's also on the second row.</i>

08:06.985 --> 08:09.686
<i>This team's only been in Formula 1 racing</i>
<i>for two years and...</i>

08:09.855 --> 08:13.786
<i>so far the car's not been</i>
<i>reliable enough to win a Grand Prix.</i>

08:13.959 --> 08:17.326
<i>But the Japanese have</i>
<i>the most powerful engines of all.</i>

09:11.082 --> 09:12.879
Ten seconds.

09:18.323 --> 09:19.654
Five...

09:20.392 --> 09:21.689
four...

09:22.661 --> 09:23.992
three...

09:24.596 --> 09:27.861
two, one.
Go!

09:41.112 --> 09:42.739
<i>Through Sainte DÃ©vote,</i>
<i>then Sarti in the lead.</i>

09:42.914 --> 09:45.314
<i>From Stoddard, Aron, Hulme,</i>
<i>Anderson and Randolph.</i>

09:45.483 --> 09:48.884
<i>Stoddard's drawing level with Sarti</i>
<i>up the hill. He's going to overtake him.</i>

09:49.054 --> 09:52.046
<i>Now, it's Sarti in the red Ferrari,</i>
<i>number 17 leading...</i>

09:52.223 --> 09:55.590
<i>past the Hotel de Paris</i>
<i>and into the Casino Square.</i>

10:48.346 --> 10:50.080
<i>Along the seafront, at the tobacconist...</i>

10:50.248 --> 10:54.077
<i>it's Sarti's red Ferrari ahead of</i>
<i>Stoddard's green BRM number 12.</i>

11:07.599 --> 11:11.365
<i>As they finish the first lap, it's Sarti first,</i>
<i>Stoddard second, Aron third...</i>

11:11.536 --> 11:14.767
<i>and fourth now</i>
<i>is Barlini's Ferrari, number 16.</i>

11:19.411 --> 11:22.869
<i>I used to think nothing</i>
<i>could be better than motorbike racing.</i>

11:23.047 --> 11:27.108
<i>Three times I'm awarded champion</i>
<i>on my motorbike. I'm happy.</i>

11:27.786 --> 11:29.651
<i>Then I go into one of these...</i>

11:29.821 --> 11:33.552
<i>These cars... You sit in a box, a coffin.</i>
<i>Gasoline all around you.</i>

11:34.359 --> 11:36.725
<i>It is like being inside a bomb.</i>

11:36.895 --> 11:39.659
<i>Crazy.</i>
<i>But, of course, the cars are faster.</i>

11:39.831 --> 11:42.493
<i>And that is the most important thing.</i>

11:50.542 --> 11:54.342
<i>You have to remember that at Monte Carlo,</i>
<i>because of the nature of the circuit...</i>

11:54.512 --> 11:57.777
<i>you shift gears over 2,600 times</i>
<i>during the race.</i>

11:58.349 --> 12:02.046
<i>That's an average of once</i>
<i>every three seconds.</i>

12:02.220 --> 12:05.280
<i>No reason to expect gearbox trouble.</i>

12:05.457 --> 12:10.087
<i>On the other hand, I suppose potential problems</i>
<i>are in the back of your mind all the time.</i>

12:10.728 --> 12:14.164
I've driven this course six times before...

12:14.332 --> 12:17.733
the way I see it, I've only got
three big problems today, and that's:

12:17.902 --> 12:21.895
Two Ferraris starting ahead of me
and my own team-mate, Scott Stoddard.

12:22.907 --> 12:29.005
<i>Well, actually walking the course is just about</i>
<i>the last thing I'd do on the morning of a race.</i>

12:29.347 --> 12:33.943
<i>It's become a bit of a thing with me.</i>
<i>I do a lot of thinking...</i>

12:34.219 --> 12:37.746
<i>collecting my thoughts about how I'll</i>
<i>run the race, so all that sort of thing.</i>

12:37.922 --> 12:43.417
<i>Of course, it originated with my brother,</i>
<i>Roger, you know. He used to do the same thing.</i>

12:43.595 --> 12:48.589
<i>As a matter of fact, before I started racing myself</i>
<i>I often used to walk the course with him.</i>

12:48.766 --> 12:51.633
<i>The funny thing about Roger,</i>
<i>you know...</i>

12:51.803 --> 12:56.331
<i>the day he was killed, he hadn't walked</i>
<i>the circuit for some reason or another.</i>

12:56.508 --> 12:59.807
<i>I suppose I'm rather superstitious</i>
<i>about that.</i>

13:09.954 --> 13:12.422
<i>I love the challenge of Monaco.</i>

13:12.590 --> 13:16.924
<i>Driving through ordinary streets full out,</i>
<i>is to me what racing is all about.</i>

13:17.095 --> 13:19.655
<i>It's a pity it's the only one</i>
<i>left of its kind.</i>

13:21.332 --> 13:25.894
<i>At the end of 10 laps, the order is still</i>
<i>Sarti, Stoddard, Aron and Barlini.</i>

13:26.070 --> 13:29.198
<i>Stoddard can't quite squeeze his BRM</i>
<i>past Sarti's Ferrari.</i>

13:29.374 --> 13:32.969
<i>There's very little room to pass</i>
<i>on these narrow Monte Carlo streets.</i>

13:33.144 --> 13:36.079
<i>Barlini and the other Ferraris</i>
<i>can't quite...</i>

13:53.231 --> 13:56.723
- Oh, my darling. You're not ready?
- Ready? For what?

13:56.901 --> 13:58.698
Pat, you've forgotten.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.770
Hugo, the way I feel now...

14:00.939 --> 14:06.275
if I could remember my own name,
I'd consider myself very fortunate.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.705
- What have I forgotten?
- Last night.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.440
I told you, I'd be by to take you
to the winner's circle...

14:11.616 --> 14:14.449
- ...if Scott wins.
- Hugo, there's lots of time.

14:14.619 --> 14:16.314
The dungarees.

14:18.022 --> 14:21.856
Hugo, have you ever had ouzo?

14:22.393 --> 14:24.384
I have had everything, my dear.

14:25.363 --> 14:30.733
I was with two Greeks last night
and we drank ouzo. A lot of ouzo.

14:31.135 --> 14:34.400
And where, may I ask,
was your husband...

14:34.572 --> 14:38.975
while all this Greek
and ouzo business was going on?

14:39.243 --> 14:42.872
Where he always is the night before a race:
Trying to sleep.

14:49.354 --> 14:52.448
<i>The danger? Well, of course.</i>

14:52.624 --> 14:55.650
<i>But you are missing</i>
<i>a very important point.</i>

14:55.827 --> 14:59.388
<i>I think, if any of us imagined,</i>
<i>really imagined...</i>

15:00.298 --> 15:05.793
<i>what it would be like to go into a tree</i>
<i>at 150 miles an hour...</i>

15:06.204 --> 15:11.039
<i>we would probably never get</i>
<i>into the cars at all. None of us.</i>

15:11.209 --> 15:15.509
<i>So it has always seemed to me,</i>
<i>that to do something very dangerous...</i>

15:15.680 --> 15:21.482
<i>requires a certain</i>
<i>absence of imagination.</i>

15:24.989 --> 15:28.015
<i>Number 17, the Ferrari of Jean-Pierre Sarti,</i>
<i>is still in front...</i>

15:28.192 --> 15:31.923
<i>but he just cannot get away from</i>
<i>number 12, Scott Stoddard in the BRM.</i>

15:32.096 --> 15:35.998
<i>And the second BRM driver, number 11,</i>
<i>Pete Aron, is only three seconds behind...</i>

15:36.167 --> 15:40.160
<i>with Nino Barlini in number 16</i>
<i>Ferrari breathing down his neck.</i>

15:53.017 --> 15:55.508
<i>That's 25 laps gone.</i>
<i>One-quarter of the race distance.</i>

15:55.687 --> 15:59.384
<i>As Sarti and Stoddard fight for the lead,</i>
<i>they're leaving Aron and Barlini behind.</i>

15:59.557 --> 16:02.890
<i>Stoddard's really pressing Sarti. The Frenchman's</i>
<i>usually unbeatable at Monaco...</i>

16:03.061 --> 16:06.326
<i>but today the Englishman is faster</i>
<i>on some parts of the circuit.</i>

17:23.574 --> 17:26.634
<i>Now that Stoddard's out in the lead,</i>
<i>his lap times are faster and faster.</i>

17:26.810 --> 17:28.642
<i>And he's going steadily away from Sarti.</i>

17:28.813 --> 17:32.408
<i>There doesn't seem to be anything</i>
<i>the Ferrari driver can do about it.</i>

17:39.524 --> 17:43.722
<i>There's Scott Stoddard completing his</i>
<i>30th lap and increasing his lead over Sarti.</i>

17:43.895 --> 17:47.387
<i>But there's the third man, Barlini,</i>
<i>in his red Ferrari now well-clear of Aron.</i>

17:47.565 --> 17:49.726
<i>And he's just lapping a slower car.</i>

17:49.901 --> 17:53.337
<i>That can be tricky here at Monte Carlo.</i>
<i>It's almost impossible to pass...</i>

17:53.504 --> 17:58.134
<i>unless you can rely on the driver in the</i>
<i>slower car to move over and make room.</i>

19:57.028 --> 20:02.591
<i>That's 32 laps completed and the order is</i>
<i>Stoddard, Sarti, Barlini, Randolph, Aron.</i>

20:12.076 --> 20:15.273
- Get back out there.
- It's sticking in between third and fourth.

20:15.446 --> 20:18.244
It didn't do it in practice.
Do you suppose it could be you?

20:18.416 --> 20:21.078
All right, I'm doing it on purpose.

20:21.252 --> 20:23.812
On purpose or not,
you're breaking her up.

20:23.988 --> 20:26.821
- I didn't build the damn car.
- We can't do anything about it.

20:26.991 --> 20:28.959
- Now, do the best you can.
- What lap is this?

20:29.126 --> 20:31.788
- Forty-two.
- It's a cinch. I'm halfway home.

20:31.963 --> 20:34.261
You're never halfway home!

20:34.432 --> 20:37.230
<i>Pete Aron's away again.</i>
<i>He's had some sort of gearbox trouble.</i>

20:37.802 --> 20:42.102
<i>There's Stoddard now. He'll lap</i>
<i>his BRM team-mate, Aron, next time round.</i>

20:42.273 --> 20:44.901
<i>Stoddard's driving a tremendous race.</i>

20:45.076 --> 20:49.638
<i>Bet he's broken the lap record again: 129.3.</i>

21:57.848 --> 22:00.942
<i>Blimey, they nearly collided</i>
<i>at the Gasometer hairpin. That was close.</i>

22:01.118 --> 22:03.318
<i>Louis Chiron's waving</i>
<i>the blue flag at the American...</i>

22:03.487 --> 22:06.781
<i>which means he ought to move over</i>
<i>and let the faster car through.</i>

22:09.627 --> 22:11.356
Let Scott through!

22:15.199 --> 22:17.997
The bloody idiot.
Sarti's picked up three seconds.

22:18.169 --> 22:20.034
You can't blame Pete
for wanting to race.

22:20.204 --> 22:23.537
Not with a team-mate!
He has to let him through!

24:42.480 --> 24:45.877
<i>There's Barlini in second place at the Gasometer</i>
<i>as Sarti completes 50 laps...</i>

24:46.050 --> 24:51.010
<i>- ...half distance in the lead.</i>
- That's my driver. Let go. Let me through.

24:58.128 --> 25:01.325
- Damn you! Damn you!
- Get these people out of here!

25:01.498 --> 25:03.432
- I waved him through.
- Where are the cops?

25:03.601 --> 25:05.899
- You're a bloody liar.
- Please, Jeff.

25:06.070 --> 25:08.470
I told you to take it easy with him.

25:08.639 --> 25:11.574
- Apart from being a bloody coward!
- Jeff, don't.

25:11.742 --> 25:15.542
- Shut up! You're a liar!
- Now, get these people out of here!

25:15.713 --> 25:17.442
Shut up.
Look, you're through with me!

25:17.615 --> 25:20.641
Now, just get out of my sight
as quick as you can!

25:21.085 --> 25:24.213
Something's happened.
There has been an accident.

25:25.155 --> 25:29.524
That's what they come for:
See someone get killed.

25:50.447 --> 25:53.610
- How did it happen?
- A bloody lot you care.

25:54.285 --> 25:57.379
- Don't you say that. Don't speak to me like that.
- Mrs. Stoddard.

25:58.455 --> 26:00.753
You can stay here if you want.

26:00.958 --> 26:03.358
It will be some time in surgery.

26:15.973 --> 26:18.237
You've got what you want now.

26:19.677 --> 26:21.975
He's finished with driving.

26:24.281 --> 26:27.512
Maybe we'll have some peace
in our lives now.

26:30.254 --> 26:31.949
You think so?

27:34.852 --> 27:38.083
How I didn't spin out
is a miracle of skill and daring.

27:38.255 --> 27:39.586
What do you think of this man?

27:39.757 --> 27:42.225
In the middle of the race
he decided to take a swim.

27:42.526 --> 27:45.324
It cost me two seconds.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.108
From the manager.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.307
Hey, Jean-Pierre.

28:01.645 --> 28:05.809
You should fix that.
I have something in my room.

28:11.789 --> 28:13.882
I just talked to the hospital.

28:14.124 --> 28:16.490
- He's alive?
- Yeah.

28:18.128 --> 28:20.255
Jordan says I was blocking.

28:20.431 --> 28:23.025
Said I didn't give him a signal to pass.

28:23.967 --> 28:25.901
- Did you?
- Of course I did.

28:26.069 --> 28:29.368
Gearbox froze coming out of the tunnel
and I waved him through.

28:29.540 --> 28:32.202
Got on the brakes, locked up,
and threw me in front of him.

28:32.376 --> 28:34.708
Next thing I knew,
I was in the middle of Mediterranean.

28:38.582 --> 28:40.846
What are you going to do now?

28:43.720 --> 28:47.656
I don't know. I'll get a ride for the rest
of the season. I don't know where.

28:48.525 --> 28:50.083
Pete?

28:51.061 --> 28:53.291
Do you ever get tired?

28:53.464 --> 28:55.227
Of the driving?

28:55.399 --> 28:56.832
No.

28:58.101 --> 29:00.626
Lately, I sometimes get very tired.

29:01.171 --> 29:04.334
You know what I mean?
Very tired.

29:56.293 --> 29:57.988
All right, unhook it.

30:38.936 --> 30:41.336
Jeff is wrong, isn't he, Scott?

30:43.006 --> 30:45.031
He says you're finished.

30:46.743 --> 30:49.007
But you're not finished, are you?

30:53.016 --> 30:54.779
I know, Scott.

30:54.952 --> 30:57.477
Better than Jeff, better than anyone.

30:59.089 --> 31:02.650
If I told them you'd drive again,
they'd think I was crazy.

31:04.561 --> 31:07.223
They'll think you're crazy
when you tell them.

31:10.233 --> 31:12.565
But you will, won't you, Scott?

31:16.106 --> 31:18.836
You're in pieces now,
but it won't change anything for you.

31:19.009 --> 31:22.410
You'll pull yourself together
and get back in the car somehow.

31:24.982 --> 31:26.711
And for what?

31:28.518 --> 31:30.748
To be better than Roger.

31:32.522 --> 31:35.082
To compete against a dead man.

31:37.394 --> 31:40.363
They don't know anything about that,
do they, Scott?

31:42.633 --> 31:44.464
Not like I know.

31:46.503 --> 31:49.028
They don't know it wasn't Pete Aron
in that car today...

31:49.206 --> 31:51.697
it was Roger you were trying to beat.

31:52.643 --> 31:55.908
Roger's in every car you try to pass.

31:58.949 --> 32:00.416
Well...

32:02.486 --> 32:05.046
this time, I'm the one that's finished.

32:07.190 --> 32:09.351
No more for me, Scott.

32:10.827 --> 32:13.227
I won't be there next time.

32:15.599 --> 32:17.396
No more for me.

32:41.224 --> 32:42.782
Please.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.526
- Madame. Madame.
- Let me through.

32:49.066 --> 32:51.000
Will he drive again?

32:53.203 --> 32:54.500
Leave it.

32:54.671 --> 32:56.502
Come on, will he be flown back to London?

33:44.387 --> 33:45.752
Leave it.

33:50.393 --> 33:52.258
I don't need your help.

33:56.266 --> 33:57.563
You bastard.

34:16.119 --> 34:17.245
- Agreement. Really.
- Yes, sir.

34:17.420 --> 34:20.685
Then we can accuse Aron
of being ungentlemanly.

34:20.857 --> 34:22.585
But not of some breaking the rules.

34:23.592 --> 34:26.255
- Oh, excuse me.
- I still don't agree.

34:26.429 --> 34:29.728
At last. I began to think
you were not coming.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.389
I'm afraid I got lost.

34:31.568 --> 34:34.092
You need only have followed the crowd.

34:34.271 --> 34:35.795
I wish I had known.

34:35.972 --> 34:38.964
I've only myself to blame.
I invited them all.

34:39.141 --> 34:41.007
First, a drink.

34:41.178 --> 34:44.773
And then I will introduce you to some
people who will be able to help you.

34:44.947 --> 34:49.282
Of course, you must tell me more about
the sort of things you'll be doing.

35:07.437 --> 35:09.530
All in a day's work, Hugo.

35:09.706 --> 35:13.665
This is work, huh?
It looks so easy.

35:21.618 --> 35:25.054
I'd like you to meet
Miss Louise Frederickson.

35:25.222 --> 35:27.213
This is Jean-Pierre Sarti.

35:27.390 --> 35:29.517
Jean-Pierre, it was a wonderful race.
Fantastic.

35:29.693 --> 35:31.422
Thank you. Thank you very much.

35:31.595 --> 35:33.085
She...

35:35.098 --> 35:38.829
She's an American journalist,
so be careful what you say?

35:39.002 --> 35:41.732
Would you believe it?
Once, a boy off the streets...

35:41.905 --> 35:43.873
and now he speaks to kings.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.973
Anyone can speak to kings, Hugo.
But will they speak back?

35:47.144 --> 35:49.942
No, but if they do, what will they say?

35:50.580 --> 35:52.411
Oh, you see must my museum.

35:52.582 --> 35:54.675
- It's something that might interest you.
- Museum?

35:54.851 --> 35:56.113
- Yes. It's a...
- Oh, Jean-Pierre?

35:56.286 --> 35:57.878
- Simply marvelous, Jean-Pierre.
- Thank you.

35:58.054 --> 35:59.521
- Simply marvelous.
- Thank you.

35:59.689 --> 36:02.852
Your first nine. Hugo, you've got
to come to settle an argument...

36:03.026 --> 36:05.620
about the 1932 Targa Florio.

36:05.795 --> 36:07.922
He's the only one old enough
to have been there.

36:08.098 --> 36:11.659
Now, there is a dubious distinction.

36:11.835 --> 36:14.065
Was an excellent race you did today, Jean-Pierre.
Well done.

36:14.237 --> 36:17.035
- Thank you, Bob. Thank you very much.
- Very good.

36:17.974 --> 36:20.374
Suppose I show you the museum?

36:20.710 --> 36:23.770
Obviously, if I don't escape from here,
we'll never get past "hello."

36:24.080 --> 36:27.106
Come to think of it,
we haven't even managed that yet.

36:27.817 --> 36:29.148
Now...

36:29.986 --> 36:32.716
- ...hello.
- Hello.

36:37.360 --> 36:40.329
- What did she mean, "your first nine"?
- Points.

36:40.497 --> 36:43.057
Toward the Drivers' World Championship.

36:51.574 --> 36:54.168
Have you known Hugo very long?

36:54.644 --> 36:56.043
Since yesterday.

36:56.212 --> 36:58.578
Someone in New York
gave me his name.

36:58.748 --> 37:00.807
He's offered me his influence.

37:00.984 --> 37:02.952
Which I gather is quite extensive.

37:03.119 --> 37:05.610
Influence? For what?

37:05.789 --> 37:08.451
Well, I work for an
American fashion magazine.

37:08.625 --> 37:10.684
And we're going to do
an issue around racing cars.

37:10.860 --> 37:14.591
Yes! Now, I have it.

37:15.098 --> 37:19.228
Of course.
Louise Frederickson.

37:19.569 --> 37:23.733
You once did an article about my wife,
Monique Delvaux.

37:24.040 --> 37:27.441
"One of the 27 best-dressed
business women in the world."

37:27.610 --> 37:29.305
Something like that.

37:29.512 --> 37:31.446
Only 10.

37:31.648 --> 37:33.582
You were away at the time, as I recall.

37:33.817 --> 37:36.047
Yes. "While..."

37:36.219 --> 37:39.950
"While her husband is off
racing motor cars...

37:40.123 --> 37:44.822
this busy woman executive
spends long evenings in her office...

37:44.995 --> 37:48.590
administering the complex affairs
of the Delvaux Motor Company."

37:49.799 --> 37:52.597
I remember that part quite well.

37:52.769 --> 37:57.331
It had about it the slight hint
of feminine prejudice...

37:57.507 --> 37:59.634
toward the footloose male.

38:01.344 --> 38:03.904
It wasn't meant to sound that way.

38:05.148 --> 38:07.013
Is your wife here tonight?

38:07.784 --> 38:10.116
She never comes to the races.

38:26.036 --> 38:27.867
Charming, isn't it?

38:30.540 --> 38:32.371
I can use this.

38:35.612 --> 38:37.375
It's interesting.

38:43.887 --> 38:46.253
Do you like motor racing?

38:47.357 --> 38:51.589
I don't know.
I had never seen a race before today.

38:53.897 --> 38:57.924
- What are these?
- Autographs.

38:58.268 --> 39:00.634
People in motor racing.

39:00.970 --> 39:02.801
Where are you?

39:03.173 --> 39:04.504
Over there, somewhere.

39:18.888 --> 39:20.913
Are you going
to the palace party tonight?

39:21.958 --> 39:23.949
I wasn't invited.

39:25.028 --> 39:27.087
I invite you.

39:27.697 --> 39:30.097
There are a lot of parties tonight,
aren't there?

39:30.433 --> 39:31.900
Yes.

39:32.135 --> 39:36.094
- Is that the usual thing after a race?
- Of course.

39:36.272 --> 39:37.864
And I can assure you...

39:38.041 --> 39:40.874
that if you don't come
to the palace party tonight with me...

39:41.044 --> 39:42.375
you will be missed.

39:44.414 --> 39:47.042
And this man Stoddard,
will he be missed too?

39:49.819 --> 39:51.787
I don't understand.

39:52.255 --> 39:54.416
- Do you know Stoddard?
- No.

39:54.591 --> 39:58.891
But I find it difficult to understand
how this sort of thing can be going on.

39:59.062 --> 40:00.927
The celebrations.

40:01.631 --> 40:04.896
When a man lies in a hospital,
possibly crippled for life.

40:12.809 --> 40:15.141
If he were dead,
it would be the same.

40:15.879 --> 40:18.313
More subdued perhaps, but the same.

40:18.481 --> 40:22.110
And apparently it doesn't
affect you at all. None of you.

40:26.289 --> 40:27.813
I'm sorry.

40:28.458 --> 40:30.983
I guess that was all very rude of me.

40:34.063 --> 40:36.998
Before you leave,
I want to tell you something.

40:37.167 --> 40:39.431
Not about the others.

40:39.602 --> 40:41.433
But about myself.

40:43.439 --> 40:45.634
I used to go to pieces.

40:46.242 --> 40:49.075
I'd see an accident like that
and feel so weak inside...

40:49.245 --> 40:51.008
that I wanted to quit.

40:51.181 --> 40:53.149
To stop the car and walk away.

40:53.316 --> 40:56.080
I could hardly make myself go past it.

40:59.022 --> 41:00.887
But I'm older now.

41:01.524 --> 41:05.824
When I see something really horrible,
I put my foot down.

41:05.995 --> 41:07.360
Hard.

41:07.530 --> 41:11.660
Because I know
that everyone else is lifting his.

41:13.369 --> 41:15.303
What a terrible way to win.

41:16.072 --> 41:19.564
No, there is no terrible way to win.

41:19.742 --> 41:21.232
There is only winning.

41:54.043 --> 41:55.340
Hello, Nino.

42:07.991 --> 42:09.822
Nino!

42:31.214 --> 42:32.579
Nino!

43:11.654 --> 43:13.246
Dance?

43:13.423 --> 43:15.414
I don't dance.

43:18.728 --> 43:20.127
Have a drink with me.

43:20.797 --> 43:22.128
I don't drink.

43:23.266 --> 43:26.633
- Smoke?
- I don't smoke.

43:34.911 --> 43:36.173
What do you do?

44:03.172 --> 44:06.835
So, you let Stoddard lap you.

44:07.009 --> 44:10.877
You're still getting yourself
into hopeless situations.

44:12.382 --> 44:15.818
It wasn't hopeless to begin with,
it just turned out that way.

44:16.452 --> 44:17.749
There's a difference.

44:17.920 --> 44:23.222
But you didn't come all the way to Modena,
to talk about Scott Stoddard. Did you?

44:28.931 --> 44:31.058
I wanna drive for you again,
Signor Manetta.

44:33.369 --> 44:36.236
Aron, your last season with me...

44:36.406 --> 44:40.399
you did nothing but tell me,
what was wrong with our cars.

44:40.576 --> 44:45.240
Then you left us, to follow hopes
that lasted a season.

44:45.415 --> 44:48.748
Then to Jordan,
now back to me.

44:48.918 --> 44:50.442
You confuse me, Aron.

44:50.620 --> 44:54.351
And I don't like men
who confuse me driving my cars.

44:56.726 --> 45:00.162
I left you because I didn't want
to become second driver to Sarti.

45:00.329 --> 45:02.092
A position you put me in.

45:02.265 --> 45:03.857
And now?

45:05.601 --> 45:07.330
I need a ride.

45:07.670 --> 45:09.262
I won a lot of races for you.

45:09.439 --> 45:13.637
Of course you did.
Before you became reckless.

45:13.910 --> 45:17.641
- I want to be champion.
- Everyone wants to be a champion, Aron.

45:17.814 --> 45:20.282
There is no distinction in that.

45:21.017 --> 45:22.951
I can be.

45:23.853 --> 45:26.549
At what cost? And to whom?

45:29.292 --> 45:30.520
All right.

45:30.693 --> 45:33.628
I'll drive for you for less than
I was getting on my old contract.

45:33.796 --> 45:35.354
I'll pay my own expenses.

45:35.531 --> 45:38.625
You take the starting money.
I'll just take my share of the prizes.

45:39.035 --> 45:42.027
I'm not talking about money, Aron.

45:42.438 --> 45:45.771
Of course, I would not appreciate
your doing to me...

45:45.942 --> 45:47.807
what you did to Jordan at Monaco.

45:47.977 --> 45:51.879
To have two cars wiped out,
at a cost of $100,000 apiece...

45:52.048 --> 45:55.176
is an unhappy experience.

45:55.351 --> 45:57.182
But I could afford that.

45:57.353 --> 46:01.483
I could not be in this business
if I weren't able to afford that.

46:01.657 --> 46:06.754
It's one of the risks I take
every time a car leaves the starting grid.

46:07.296 --> 46:10.060
But what is a greater risk, Aron...

46:10.233 --> 46:15.569
what means far more to me
than anything else is a good name.

46:16.038 --> 46:21.374
Our reputation represents desire
for perfection of the highest quality.

46:21.544 --> 46:24.172
I gamble that reputation gladly.

46:24.347 --> 46:28.215
Because I have
absolute faith in every car...

46:28.384 --> 46:30.978
that leaves this factory.

46:33.022 --> 46:36.753
But I will not risk it in a driver...

46:36.926 --> 46:39.520
in whom I cannot have an equal faith.

46:41.898 --> 46:46.926
There are fewer than 30 men in the world,
qualified to drive Formula 1.

46:47.136 --> 46:50.663
A mere half-dozen, perhaps, to win.

46:51.207 --> 46:55.837
At this moment, I'm inclined to think
you're not one of them.

47:23.339 --> 47:25.603
Tough luck, Scott.

47:26.075 --> 47:28.339
- Hello. How are you? All right?
- Jeff, how are you?

47:28.511 --> 47:31.344
Is it true that doctors strongly advise
against moving Scott?

47:31.514 --> 47:35.416
No, the decision to come home was Scott's alone.
He felt with English doctors he'd probably...

47:35.585 --> 47:38.884
What about next season?
Scott, will you be ready to drive?

47:39.855 --> 47:41.345
He's ready to drive now.

47:41.524 --> 47:44.755
I just don't happen to have
a car for him at the moment.

47:45.761 --> 47:48.321
All right, let's get him in.

47:51.968 --> 47:54.232
- Hey, Jeff.
- Yeah?

47:54.503 --> 47:57.404
What about these rumors of a divorce
between Scott and Pat?

47:57.573 --> 47:59.803
- Absolute nonsense.
- I know, but we've heard...

47:59.976 --> 48:03.912
Now, look, Mrs. Stoddard is taking
an enforced vacation under doctor's orders.

48:04.080 --> 48:07.072
And you know neither heaven nor earth
could keep her from Scott's side.

48:07.249 --> 48:09.114
- She's just on this holiday, all right.
- Yeah, all right.

48:09.285 --> 48:11.344
- Okay. Thanks.
- Good luck.

48:14.290 --> 48:16.724
- Where is she?
- Forget her.

48:17.193 --> 48:20.060
- Where is she, Jeff?
- I don't know.

48:21.931 --> 48:23.956
I want her back, you know.

48:26.102 --> 48:27.399
You're a fool, then.

48:27.570 --> 48:29.595
Jeff, you've never understood her.

48:29.772 --> 48:33.833
I know you think she's frivolous,
incapable of any kind of understanding.

48:34.010 --> 48:36.877
But you're wrong.
It's just that she hates what I do.

48:38.314 --> 48:42.182
I think she still loves me, you know.
Hard as that may be for you to understand.

48:43.185 --> 48:46.211
Trouble is, she's got to persuade
herself that she doesn't.

48:49.492 --> 48:52.086
I worry about what she might do...

48:52.461 --> 48:54.691
trying to convince herself of that.

48:56.632 --> 48:59.499
- Fine. Thank you, David. Where's Tina?
- Tina! Tina!

48:59.669 --> 49:01.193
Tina?

49:10.579 --> 49:12.945
Hey, Pat? In the car, please.

49:13.115 --> 49:15.083
- How am I doing?
- What you're doing beautifully.

49:15.251 --> 49:18.846
- I look all right?
- You look fine. Now, just stop worrying.

49:19.955 --> 49:23.356
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

49:25.695 --> 49:28.095
I expected you to be back
in America by now.

49:28.264 --> 49:31.893
Oh, no. We'll be doing this
the entire season. I thought you knew.

49:32.068 --> 49:33.399
No, no.

49:33.569 --> 49:35.503
Does Guido know about all this?

49:35.671 --> 49:37.935
Of course.
Arrangements were made.

49:38.107 --> 49:40.905
Well, I can't say I'm not properly dressed
for the occasion.

49:41.077 --> 49:43.409
I should be wearing
something fashionable.

49:43.579 --> 49:47.606
Well, your driver's suit isn't bad.
Maybe you could start a new style.

49:47.783 --> 49:51.719
Spun-glass, form-fitting,
waterproof, flameproof.

49:52.822 --> 49:54.722
What's Pat doing here?

49:54.957 --> 49:57.653
Oh, she asked for a job
and I was able to give her one.

49:57.827 --> 49:59.818
She's very good.

50:00.930 --> 50:03.364
- Hello, Pat.
- Hello, Jean-Pierre.

50:03.532 --> 50:07.366
You're looking very chic in my car.

50:08.571 --> 50:11.369
- How's Scott?
- I don't know.

50:17.513 --> 50:20.311
- Arrangements were made.
- They told me arrangements were made.

50:20.483 --> 50:21.848
Guido.
They mean no harm.

51:06.195 --> 51:08.663
<i>So far, Sarti has</i>
<i>the fastest practice time.</i>

51:08.831 --> 51:12.562
<i>If nobody goes any faster this afternoon,</i>
<i>the Ferrari will be in pole position...</i>

51:12.735 --> 51:14.362
<i>for tomorrow's French Grand Prix.</i>

51:14.537 --> 51:17.506
<i>Sarti's time was 3 minutes,</i>
<i>11.1 seconds.</i>

51:17.673 --> 51:19.868
<i>95.1 miles an hour.</i>

51:20.042 --> 51:21.839
<i>This Clermont Ferrand circuit is just...</i>

51:22.011 --> 51:24.946
- How do you feel?
- Like an idiot.

51:25.114 --> 51:28.948
Don't look so glum.
It's an honorable profession.

51:29.251 --> 51:32.345
- You'd rather be dogcatcher or something?
- Or something.

51:35.791 --> 51:38.589
- He's doing well.
- He could do better.

51:38.761 --> 51:40.820
A slave driver, this one.

51:40.996 --> 51:43.021
This looks very complicated.

51:43.199 --> 51:44.666
At first glance.

51:44.834 --> 51:48.998
It's only a different way to tell time.
More precise.

51:49.438 --> 51:52.464
Well, I'm afraid I don't understand
any of this.

51:52.708 --> 51:54.835
- Not any of it?
- No.

51:55.010 --> 51:58.173
I mean, for one thing, it looks to me
as though the spectators...

51:58.347 --> 52:00.781
can't really see very much of the race.

52:00.950 --> 52:02.941
True enough, I suppose.

52:03.118 --> 52:05.609
Jean-Pierre, <i>andiamo!</i>

52:05.955 --> 52:08.446
And the risks you take.
Aren't they ridiculous?

52:08.624 --> 52:11.422
I might understand it if you
made a great deal of money...

52:11.594 --> 52:13.459
but I'm told you don't at all.

52:13.629 --> 52:18.032
Some of us do. But money
is not an important part of it.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.964
- Then what is?
- Many things.

52:21.136 --> 52:23.161
It's marvelous to go very fast.

52:23.572 --> 52:26.006
Why is it so marvelous to go very fast?

52:26.175 --> 52:27.437
Answer that one, Lisa.

52:30.312 --> 52:32.610
- Hello, Chris.
- Hi, Pete.

52:36.652 --> 52:39.143
- Jean-Pierre. How are you?
- Hey!

52:40.256 --> 52:42.724
- How are you, Pete?
- All right.

52:45.861 --> 52:47.522
Hey, Nino.

52:47.696 --> 52:50.221
The cars aren't good enough
for him anymore.

52:50.399 --> 52:54.062
Interview me first, Pete.
I have had a fascinating life.

52:54.236 --> 52:55.863
- I might as well.
- World should know.

52:56.038 --> 52:58.700
I wouldn't want people to think
I was unemployed or something.

52:58.874 --> 53:02.469
I was a born a poor boy
in Cerda, Sicily. Nothing to eat.

53:02.711 --> 53:05.737
- Not a crumb of bread in the house.
- I guess Manetta told you...

53:05.915 --> 53:08.213
- ...I came looking for a job.
- Every year, I would...

53:08.384 --> 53:10.750
Well, I think he should've found you one.

53:10.920 --> 53:15.220
Cerda is right on the course
of the great Targa Florio race.

53:15.391 --> 53:19.259
- Knock it off, will you?
- Knock it off? What's that?

53:19.428 --> 53:23.865
It means: You would be
well-advised to cease.

53:25.901 --> 53:27.198
Yes.

53:27.369 --> 53:30.031
"Knock it off."
I like that.

53:36.278 --> 53:38.143
<i>Now, we're pleased to announce the arrival...</i>

53:38.314 --> 53:41.806
<i>of the famous Japanese industrialist,</i>
<i>Mr. Izo Yamura.</i>

53:41.984 --> 53:45.317
<i>He's been racing Formula 1 cars</i>
<i>for more than two years now.</i>

53:45.487 --> 53:47.887
<i>But this is his first visit</i>
<i>to a Grand Prix circuit.</i>

53:48.057 --> 53:50.355
<i>And we're delighted to welcome him</i>
<i>to Clermont Ferrand.</i>

53:50.526 --> 53:52.619
This might be something to get, Pete.

53:54.096 --> 53:57.190
Well, you care to come watch my debut?

54:14.550 --> 54:16.677
- Hello, Tim.
- Hello, Pete.

54:16.852 --> 54:17.851
- Hello again.
- Pete, how are you?

54:18.075 --> 54:18.753
Hello, Pete.

54:18.954 --> 54:22.515
Mr. Yamura? My name is Pete Aron.

54:32.668 --> 54:36.604
Mr. Yamura wishes you to know that he,
of course, recognizes from photographs...

54:36.772 --> 54:38.501
the well-known Mr. Aron.

54:38.674 --> 54:41.234
Although he was at first
somewhat confused...

54:41.410 --> 54:43.708
to find you in your present occupation.

54:44.313 --> 54:49.376
He also offers his regrets in regard
to your unfortunate accident at Monaco.

54:49.618 --> 54:52.519
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.

54:53.188 --> 54:57.124
I was wondering if Mr. Yamura
would consent to doing an interview?

55:00.796 --> 55:03.697
Mr. Yamura regrets
he does not give interviews.

55:06.935 --> 55:11.065
Well, I'm sorry. Thank you,
thank you very much, sir.

55:11.473 --> 55:13.168
- See you, Tim.
- See you later, Pete.

55:15.511 --> 55:17.411
Well, I'm off to a flying start.

55:17.579 --> 55:20.776
- Well, there's always Nino.
- Yeah. There's always Nino.

55:20.949 --> 55:22.974
He was born in Cerda, Sicily, you know.

55:23.152 --> 55:24.744
Not a crumb of bread in the house.

55:24.920 --> 55:28.651
But he always knew that someday,
someday a poor guy, you know.

55:29.191 --> 55:31.682
<i>Of course there's no trouble</i>
<i>between Scott and me.</i>

55:31.860 --> 55:34.055
<i>I've simply resumed my career.</i>

55:34.963 --> 55:37.022
<i>Well, one of my careers.</i>

55:37.199 --> 55:39.292
<i>Mostly at Scott's urging,</i>
<i>I might add.</i>

55:39.468 --> 55:41.663
<i>Well, it would hardly be a proper motor</i>
<i>racing season...</i>

55:41.837 --> 55:45.102
<i>without the Stoddard name connected</i>
<i>to it in some way, would it, Pat?</i>

55:45.274 --> 55:48.766
<i>Considering what the Stoddards have been</i>
<i>to the sport in the past few years.</i>

55:48.944 --> 55:52.778
<i>Needless to say, I'm present in a far more</i>
<i>humble capacity than Scott would be.</i>

55:53.282 --> 55:56.843
<i>Still I'm delighted to be able to represent</i>
<i>the name for the rest of this season.</i>

55:57.019 --> 55:58.850
<i>Pat, when did you last talk to Scott?</i>

55:59.054 --> 56:02.148
<i>Can you give us some idea</i>
<i>of how he's coming along?</i>

56:02.324 --> 56:05.555
<i>Oh, we talk two or three times a day.</i>
<i>He's coming along beautifully.</i>

56:05.727 --> 56:09.458
<i>And he wants everyone to know</i>
<i>how very grateful he is for all the hun...</i>

56:14.169 --> 56:17.263
That interview concludes
this broadcast from Clemont Ferrand.

56:17.439 --> 56:20.033
Tomorrow, beginning at 3:00,
there will be a live transmission...

56:20.209 --> 56:22.734
of the start of the French Grand Prix.

56:25.747 --> 56:28.045
- Hello, Jean-Pierre.
- Hello, Pat.

56:28.217 --> 56:30.515
Hello. Pete.

56:31.620 --> 56:33.110
You were fine.

56:34.556 --> 56:36.751
That was beautiful, Pat.
Really beautiful.

56:36.925 --> 56:41.157
Particularly the part about representing
the Stoddard name?

56:41.330 --> 56:42.558
That was especially good.

56:44.766 --> 56:46.358
You'll have to be careful, though.

56:46.535 --> 56:50.130
Scott gets a load of that kind of thing,
he's liable to recover very quickly.

56:50.305 --> 56:52.170
You'll be out of a career again.

57:00.349 --> 57:02.112
You're very superior, Mr. Aron.

57:02.751 --> 57:05.151
For the man to put Scott Stoddard
where he is.

57:05.988 --> 57:08.252
Scott put Scott where he is.

57:16.832 --> 57:20.700
That was a perfectly appalling thing,
what he said to that girl.

57:20.869 --> 57:24.771
He may have done it badly,
but he isn't altogether wrong, you know.

57:25.641 --> 57:30.135
The Stoddards don't exactly have
what one would call a fairy-tale marriage.

57:31.380 --> 57:34.645
- Well, that's their business, isn't it?
- Not if she chooses...

57:34.816 --> 57:37.046
to discuss it
in front of a television camera.

57:37.386 --> 57:40.150
Now, would you care for some lunch?

57:40.322 --> 57:43.052
Nino seems to have enough there
for all of us.

57:54.603 --> 57:58.630
That's what comes
of a poverty-stricken childhood.

57:58.807 --> 58:00.741
This girl has died from over-timing.

58:01.043 --> 58:04.103
Enough food. I need the sun.

58:04.479 --> 58:06.640
The sun it will be.

58:13.622 --> 58:15.988
Sun, food and sex.

58:16.158 --> 58:19.616
It's hard to think of them
10 years from now.

58:19.795 --> 58:21.456
Fat and married.

58:21.630 --> 58:24.326
With five fat children.

58:24.499 --> 58:27.525
Maybe.
Maybe they'll avoid it.

58:27.703 --> 58:29.796
The marriage or the fat?

58:30.205 --> 58:31.502
Both.

58:32.074 --> 58:34.167
You don't believe in marriage?

58:34.943 --> 58:37.468
It depends on whose marriage it is.

59:02.904 --> 59:06.738
- I apologize for that.
- Why?

59:06.908 --> 59:09.001
Because it was bad manners.

59:09.378 --> 59:11.642
What does it matter to you
what I do or don't do?

59:12.080 --> 59:14.207
Girl has to make a living.

59:14.816 --> 59:17.910
Last time a girl said that to me,
she was stepping out of her skirt...

59:18.086 --> 59:21.613
- ...and asking for a hundred-dollar bill.
- Making a comparison?

59:25.861 --> 59:27.692
When did you last talk to Scott?

59:28.530 --> 59:31.431
- At Monaco.
- That's sweet.

59:32.234 --> 59:33.895
Why are we being so offensive?

59:34.569 --> 59:36.662
Probably because
we don't like each other.

59:37.205 --> 59:39.173
Speak for yourself.

59:51.720 --> 59:53.153
Now, you see?

59:53.322 --> 59:58.487
The object is to put the fly exactly
where you want it to be.

59:58.827 --> 01:00:02.194
Now, what difference does it make?
It's a big lake.

01:00:02.364 --> 01:00:04.457
The difference is the art of it.

01:00:04.633 --> 01:00:07.864
We could wade out and hit the fish
over the head...

01:00:08.036 --> 01:00:12.029
but there would be no art in that,
would there? Now...

01:00:13.675 --> 01:00:16.439
Now, is that where you
wanted it to land?

01:00:16.611 --> 01:00:19.273
Would I admit to anything else?

01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:23.878
Where was I?

01:00:25.354 --> 01:00:28.346
You began racing
because of your marriage.

01:00:28.857 --> 01:00:30.222
Yeah.

01:00:31.393 --> 01:00:33.884
When we got married,
Monique and I...

01:00:34.062 --> 01:00:39.193
Delvaux had just started competition
and I began testing cars.

01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:42.062
The next step, of course, was racing.

01:00:42.504 --> 01:00:45.996
Delvaux stopped racing some years ago.
But I kept on.

01:00:46.174 --> 01:00:47.641
Why?

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:52.243
Well, actually I think
I've begun to wonder myself.

01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:55.940
But I suppose it doesn't really matter.
A man does what he does.

01:00:56.118 --> 01:00:58.211
We do what we most want to do,
I suppose.

01:00:58.387 --> 01:01:00.787
Now, you try.

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:04.255
Here, and here.
Hold it here.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.894
This way. Here.

01:01:08.196 --> 01:01:09.891
Where are the fish?

01:01:10.065 --> 01:01:13.057
The fire is too high.
We must have a bed of embers.

01:01:13.435 --> 01:01:17.337
We will have a bed of cold gray ashes
by the time you catch a fish.

01:01:17.672 --> 01:01:20.869
Have faith, Nino.
I tell you, there are fish.

01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:24.437
Now, very gently.
Come on. Now.

01:01:25.147 --> 01:01:26.910
- Very good.
- There.

01:01:27.082 --> 01:01:28.674
Is that a good place for it to be?

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:31.785
Doesn't really matter.
It's a big lake.

01:01:35.123 --> 01:01:40.288
Hey! My stomach refuses to accept
your promises any longer.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:44.297
If there were some beefsteak,
I would cook you meat...

01:01:44.466 --> 01:01:48.402
- ...in the style of the Auvergne.
- An excellent idea.

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:52.006
There is no beefsteak.
We will have fish.

01:01:52.174 --> 01:01:54.699
In the house, hidden behind the cheese...

01:01:54.876 --> 01:01:57.470
in the cooler: Beefsteak.

01:01:58.146 --> 01:02:02.708
We will save some for you
because there are no fish in this lake.

01:02:03.251 --> 01:02:05.549
Go away, Nino!
You are too close!

01:02:11.927 --> 01:02:13.895
Why aren't you married?

01:02:16.798 --> 01:02:19.961
Well, it's not a very subtle question, is it?

01:02:20.135 --> 01:02:23.104
I need all my subtlety for the trout.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.733
How do you know I'm not married?

01:02:29.377 --> 01:02:33.507
I have noted the unmarried
woman's brave air of independence...

01:02:33.682 --> 01:02:36.207
mingled with vague longing.

01:02:38.053 --> 01:02:40.317
Independence, maybe.

01:02:41.323 --> 01:02:44.588
Vague longing. I wasn't aware of that.

01:02:45.026 --> 01:02:47.893
Something perhaps
only a man would see.

01:02:49.097 --> 01:02:50.894
Or imagine.

01:02:53.134 --> 01:02:56.501
Well, no vague longing, then?

01:02:56.738 --> 01:02:59.172
But not too much
independence either, I hope.

01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:02.504
Very bad for a woman
to be too independent.

01:03:02.811 --> 01:03:04.745
Very bad for whom?

01:03:07.916 --> 01:03:10.578
I like to be free.

01:03:11.052 --> 01:03:13.213
I like traveling.

01:03:13.955 --> 01:03:16.321
I like making my own decisions.

01:03:16.791 --> 01:03:19.589
Meeting new people, working.

01:03:21.463 --> 01:03:23.431
I like to be free.

01:03:34.509 --> 01:03:36.704
I was married once.

01:03:38.179 --> 01:03:40.443
But he was in love
with someone else.

01:03:44.753 --> 01:03:46.653
You going to win tomorrow?

01:03:48.456 --> 01:03:49.980
Probably.

01:07:27.509 --> 01:07:30.637
Could we declare a truce long enough
for you to buy me a drink?

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:32.577
Sure.

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.253
I'll have one of those.

01:07:44.459 --> 01:07:48.156
Well, Sarti did it again.

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:50.464
Yeah, he drove a good race.

01:07:51.199 --> 01:07:53.292
How do you like your new job?

01:07:53.568 --> 01:07:55.399
It's what I've always wanted to do.

01:07:57.906 --> 01:08:03.606
You know, I've known you for, what?
Two and a half years.

01:08:03.778 --> 01:08:06.338
And all I know about you
is that you drive cars.

01:08:06.514 --> 01:08:09.142
That's all anyone knows
so far as I can tell.

01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:11.511
You've just written my biography.

01:08:12.387 --> 01:08:14.947
"The Silent and Secretive Pete Aron."

01:08:15.123 --> 01:08:17.283
"Inside Pete Aron."

01:08:17.591 --> 01:08:19.287
"What's Pete Aron Really Like?"

01:08:20.461 --> 01:08:22.224
It will never sell.

01:08:29.703 --> 01:08:31.638
Will you give me a lift back to the hotel?

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:44.145
You know, I'll never understand
why none of you...

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:47.049
get this sort of thing out
of your systems on the track.

01:08:47.255 --> 01:08:49.654
We all drive like maniacs.

01:08:52.961 --> 01:08:55.225
I've left Scott, you know.

01:08:56.663 --> 01:08:57.892
Really.

01:08:58.099 --> 01:08:59.930
Yes, I know.

01:09:00.268 --> 01:09:02.395
You've got a great sense of timing.

01:09:03.571 --> 01:09:07.631
You think I should be at his bedside,
nursing him back to health and vigor?

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:11.837
I guess I'm just
an old-fashioned boy at heart.

01:09:12.013 --> 01:09:14.140
You don't understand.

01:09:14.782 --> 01:09:17.216
I left him because he won't quit.

01:09:17.518 --> 01:09:20.145
He won't stop racing.
And I couldn't take it anymore.

01:09:20.321 --> 01:09:22.050
I couldn't stand it.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:24.881
You know what he does
the night before a race?

01:09:25.059 --> 01:09:26.582
He lies in bed and sweats.

01:09:31.299 --> 01:09:34.426
But then, you wouldn't know
what that would be like for a woman.

01:09:35.336 --> 01:09:37.133
To live with that.

01:09:52.687 --> 01:09:56.589
Will you go back to America
when you are finished with your click-click?

01:09:56.758 --> 01:09:58.555
Yes, of course.

01:09:59.527 --> 01:10:02.587
You couldn't be persuaded
to remain in Europe?

01:10:02.897 --> 01:10:05.195
My life is in America.

01:10:06.067 --> 01:10:07.932
What is your life?

01:10:08.903 --> 01:10:10.632
What is it?

01:10:12.473 --> 01:10:14.907
I never thought about that, I suppose.

01:10:15.610 --> 01:10:17.874
Well, think about it.

01:10:20.715 --> 01:10:22.239
Friends...

01:10:23.384 --> 01:10:24.783
work.

01:10:25.887 --> 01:10:27.377
That's my life.

01:10:27.555 --> 01:10:29.887
My friends and my work.

01:10:31.459 --> 01:10:34.223
Well, one needs those.

01:10:35.563 --> 01:10:39.397
But what do you need now?

01:10:39.567 --> 01:10:41.159
Nothing.

01:10:42.603 --> 01:10:44.093
Liar.

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:48.706
Come with me, Louise.

01:10:50.945 --> 01:10:54.312
- Where?
- To a place I have in Monza.

01:10:54.682 --> 01:10:57.116
I have to go there to test a new car.

01:10:57.452 --> 01:11:00.512
There are two weeks before
the Belgium Grand Prix.

01:11:00.755 --> 01:11:03.519
We could leave tonight after the party.

01:11:03.691 --> 01:11:05.215
Come with me.

01:11:09.464 --> 01:11:10.692
And your wife?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.901
We share nothing
but our business interests.

01:11:15.536 --> 01:11:16.525
Nothing.

01:11:19.774 --> 01:11:21.867
What do you think we would share?

01:11:23.044 --> 01:11:24.602
More than that.

01:11:27.315 --> 01:11:28.339
A bed?

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:31.480
More than that.

01:11:32.053 --> 01:11:33.042
With luck.

01:11:36.157 --> 01:11:38.284
Luck has nothing to do with it.

01:11:47.402 --> 01:11:50.394
- Why do you all do that?
- Do what?

01:11:50.571 --> 01:11:53.472
Wear your sunglasses on top of your head?

01:11:54.609 --> 01:11:57.635
- I don't know.
- It looks ridiculous.

01:12:00.882 --> 01:12:03.180
I guess you're going to the party tonight.

01:12:03.584 --> 01:12:07.315
- No. You?
- No.

01:12:08.956 --> 01:12:11.083
What are you going to do about dinner?

01:12:11.726 --> 01:12:15.025
- How many guesses do I get?
- Nine.

01:12:15.263 --> 01:12:18.096
- Guesses?
- O'clock.

01:12:51.165 --> 01:12:52.860
Mr. Yamura?

01:12:54.902 --> 01:12:56.733
Mr. Yamura, I got your message.

01:13:00.708 --> 01:13:01.970
Your message.

01:13:03.044 --> 01:13:07.913
Yes, I was hoping
it would reach you in time.

01:13:08.316 --> 01:13:09.647
Well, I thought...

01:13:10.852 --> 01:13:13.184
Well, you do speak English.

01:13:13.354 --> 01:13:16.915
Yes, but not for the press.

01:13:17.091 --> 01:13:19.150
I hope you will forgive me.

01:13:19.961 --> 01:13:21.258
That's quite all right.

01:13:21.429 --> 01:13:25.456
There have been times when I wish I'd been
able to pull something like that myself.

01:13:26.634 --> 01:13:30.764
I gather, then, that you didn't ask me
here as a reporter?

01:13:32.273 --> 01:13:34.867
Will you join me in some tea?

01:13:40.181 --> 01:13:45.881
Some years ago,
when I decided to race cars...

01:13:46.053 --> 01:13:50.649
I tried to buy
the Jordan-BRM Company.

01:13:50.825 --> 01:13:53.419
Oh, yes. I had heard that.

01:13:54.028 --> 01:13:56.622
Impatience on my part.

01:13:56.797 --> 01:14:02.030
I also manufacture radios
and sewing machines.

01:14:04.639 --> 01:14:10.271
In order to save time,
I wanted a proven product.

01:14:10.645 --> 01:14:13.580
That was not to be, however.

01:14:13.748 --> 01:14:18.208
Racing cars are not merely
another product.

01:14:18.586 --> 01:14:20.816
They require great attention.

01:14:20.988 --> 01:14:24.151
If any success is to be hoped for.

01:14:24.759 --> 01:14:26.158
Then that's why you're here.

01:14:27.395 --> 01:14:33.823
I have been racing my car
in Formula 1 for two years.

01:14:34.302 --> 01:14:39.262
And have yet to win my first Grand Prix.

01:14:39.574 --> 01:14:45.137
I intend to win by whatever means
are open to me.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.145
That's the right attitude.

01:14:48.316 --> 01:14:51.012
All you have to do is go fast enough
and long enough.

01:14:51.319 --> 01:14:55.278
And with the best drivers.

01:14:56.023 --> 01:14:59.618
Do you want a job with me?

01:15:00.428 --> 01:15:03.920
- Driving?
- Driving, of course.

01:15:04.098 --> 01:15:06.225
- Who are you dumping?
- Dumping?

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.858
Oh, which one of your drivers
are you getting rid of?

01:15:10.037 --> 01:15:11.265
Neither one.

01:15:11.439 --> 01:15:13.737
I am entering a third car.

01:15:16.377 --> 01:15:19.244
- That will be expensive.
- Yes.

01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:23.514
You've got a driver.

01:15:24.118 --> 01:15:29.647
My racing headquarters
is at Silverstone in England.

01:15:30.157 --> 01:15:33.684
- Can you be there next week?
- Yes, sir.

01:15:33.861 --> 01:15:37.854
We must begin to think about Spa.

01:15:38.866 --> 01:15:44.736
- Next week, then.
- By the way, you are a terrible broadcaster.

01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:48.900
Oh, Mr. Aron.

01:15:49.443 --> 01:15:54.278
If giving you the job
would have meant firing...

01:15:54.448 --> 01:15:59.909
one of the other drivers,
would you still have taken it?

01:16:04.091 --> 01:16:05.456
Good.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.131
- Is it true what you said about Scott?
- What?

01:16:16.304 --> 01:16:20.138
About not being able to sleep
the night before a race?

01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:26.036
Man like that should be
in some other line of work.

01:16:26.881 --> 01:16:29.247
I'll bet you sleep like a baby.

01:16:31.319 --> 01:16:33.150
I'm divorcing him.

01:16:33.487 --> 01:16:34.920
Are you?

01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:37.419
Why tell me?

01:16:37.858 --> 01:16:41.089
Well, because I don't think
you were entirely joking...

01:16:41.262 --> 01:16:43.662
when you said you're
an old-fashioned boy at heart.

01:16:43.831 --> 01:16:47.323
And old-fashioned boys
have old-fashioned scruples.

01:16:47.501 --> 01:16:51.870
- About what?
- About other people's wives.

01:16:52.473 --> 01:16:54.236
I don't follow you.

01:16:54.809 --> 01:16:56.834
Like hell you don't.

01:17:11.959 --> 01:17:13.358
Good night.

01:18:02.773 --> 01:18:04.707
- Memo?
- Jean-Pierre.

01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:10.613
Memo, good to see you.
I would like you to meet Miss Frederickson.

01:18:11.448 --> 01:18:13.211
How do you do?

01:18:15.019 --> 01:18:17.078
Yes, there's luggage in the car.

01:18:17.254 --> 01:18:18.482
Rafael?

01:18:25.596 --> 01:18:27.928
Come, I'll show you around.

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.740
The only member of this club?

01:18:38.909 --> 01:18:41.377
The only one
who keeps an apartment here.

01:18:41.545 --> 01:18:44.571
In fact, I have the only apartment.

01:18:47.818 --> 01:18:52.619
"Jean-Pierre Sarti,
World Champion, 1961."

01:18:57.194 --> 01:18:58.889
It's so quiet.

01:18:59.063 --> 01:19:01.588
Appreciate it while you can.

01:19:01.799 --> 01:19:06.361
At Grand Prix time,
crowds, excitement, noise. Terrible.

01:19:18.015 --> 01:19:21.041
- Care to drink?
- No.

01:19:30.894 --> 01:19:32.759
Are you very tired?

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:34.729
No.

01:20:26.049 --> 01:20:30.452
To health, wealth and happiness.

01:20:32.022 --> 01:20:34.616
You are very greedy.

01:20:36.493 --> 01:20:37.858
No.

01:20:39.496 --> 01:20:41.020
Hopeful.

01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:48.565
There are seven more races.

01:20:49.173 --> 01:20:51.004
Yes, seven.

01:20:57.047 --> 01:20:58.378
And then?

01:21:00.384 --> 01:21:01.715
Do you want to think that far?

01:21:04.454 --> 01:21:05.443
No.

01:21:06.623 --> 01:21:07.612
Good.

01:21:11.929 --> 01:21:14.227
Now I feel marvelous.

01:21:15.499 --> 01:21:16.989
Marvelous.

01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:20.159
And you?

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.429
Yes.

01:21:45.662 --> 01:21:47.425
Smile for the cameras.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.131
Come.

01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:11.587
As you can see,
we work day and night here...

01:22:11.755 --> 01:22:13.552
to get the car ready.

01:22:13.724 --> 01:22:15.851
I'll take your word for it.

01:22:25.335 --> 01:22:29.499
We must immediately mold
the cockpit for you.

01:22:29.673 --> 01:22:31.197
Yes, sir.

01:22:41.351 --> 01:22:45.082
All right? Or too long?

01:22:58.669 --> 01:23:01.763
- I like what you've done here.
- Thank you.

01:23:02.205 --> 01:23:05.606
I was afraid it might have offended.

01:23:05.776 --> 01:23:07.573
Offended? How?

01:23:07.744 --> 01:23:11.680
My not adapting to your ways.

01:23:11.848 --> 01:23:13.372
No, not at all, sir.

01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:17.714
I promise you, if I'm ever in Japan
and I entertain you for dinner...

01:23:17.888 --> 01:23:19.583
you'll get a fork.

01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:21.553
Fair enough.

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.994
Right after the war...

01:23:25.162 --> 01:23:30.930
my house in Tokyo was used
by an American general and his family.

01:23:32.135 --> 01:23:35.263
When it was returned to me...

01:23:35.439 --> 01:23:39.239
it had flowered wallpaper...

01:23:39.509 --> 01:23:44.845
three new bathrooms
and four new closets.

01:23:45.115 --> 01:23:49.142
Americans, I think,
are over-devoted...

01:23:49.319 --> 01:23:52.311
to bathrooms and closets.

01:23:52.489 --> 01:23:55.117
Well, we accumulate things.

01:23:55.292 --> 01:23:58.819
And then you lock them away in closets.

01:23:59.129 --> 01:24:01.222
And the bathrooms?

01:24:01.598 --> 01:24:04.066
No, no. You don't get me on that one.

01:24:05.535 --> 01:24:08.936
- Were you in the war?
- Yes. And you?

01:24:09.106 --> 01:24:11.301
No, I missed it by a year.

01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:18.006
In the war, I was a fighter pilot.

01:24:18.315 --> 01:24:21.876
I shot down 17 American planes.

01:24:24.588 --> 01:24:27.318
- Okay.
- I believe...

01:24:27.491 --> 01:24:30.892
that some things
must not be left unsaid.

01:24:33.296 --> 01:24:35.526
There will come a time...

01:24:35.699 --> 01:24:38.167
when you will ask yourself:

01:24:38.335 --> 01:24:42.897
"What did he do in the war?
This man, Yamura?"

01:24:44.508 --> 01:24:47.773
- Mr. Yamura, I like you.
- Why?

01:24:48.078 --> 01:24:49.807
Well, because...

01:24:50.881 --> 01:24:54.783
- Because you come right to the point.
- In a sense...

01:24:55.952 --> 01:24:59.183
you're here because you drive a car...

01:24:59.356 --> 01:25:02.484
the way I conduct my business.

01:25:02.659 --> 01:25:04.559
You come right to the point.

01:25:09.666 --> 01:25:11.930
- Hello, Mrs. Stoddard. Nice to see you.
- Jeff.

01:25:12.102 --> 01:25:14.536
- Scott.
- That's okay, just get me the crutches.

01:25:14.704 --> 01:25:16.797
- All right, come here.
- Hello, Mother.

01:25:16.973 --> 01:25:19.999
- It's good to have you home.
- Well, how are you? Place looks terrific.

01:25:20.177 --> 01:25:21.940
Thanks. Hello.

01:25:22.112 --> 01:25:23.875
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you.

01:25:24.047 --> 01:25:25.605
Gates, come and shake my hand.

01:25:25.782 --> 01:25:29.081
- How are you? Fine?
- Terrific, thank you.

01:25:29.352 --> 01:25:31.286
Come along in.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.355
Careful there, it's slippery.

01:25:42.866 --> 01:25:45.027
Can you manage all right?

01:25:51.475 --> 01:25:53.500
I'll get Thompson to bring lunch
to your room.

01:25:53.677 --> 01:25:56.237
- I'll eat downstairs.
- You can't go downstairs again.

01:25:56.413 --> 01:26:00.144
I'm getting up the stairs,
I can certainly get down them again.

01:26:09.693 --> 01:26:12.856
If worse comes to the worse,
I can always slide down the banisters.

01:26:13.029 --> 01:26:15.725
- Right?
- Yes.

01:26:28.912 --> 01:26:32.109
- You'll stay for lunch, Jeff?
- I'd love to.

01:26:53.303 --> 01:26:57.034
I should've thought you'd have
cleared this lot out long ago.

01:26:57.974 --> 01:27:01.432
- Why?
- Roger's dead.

01:27:02.712 --> 01:27:05.704
It's just too bloody morbid.

01:27:06.816 --> 01:27:10.115
- Where are your own things?
- I don't know.

01:27:10.287 --> 01:27:12.312
Around somewhere.

01:27:12.856 --> 01:27:15.654
Of course, they're nothing compared
to this lot.

01:27:18.228 --> 01:27:19.923
Something to shoot for, old boy.

01:27:20.297 --> 01:27:22.822
You gotta have something to shoot for.

01:27:23.767 --> 01:27:27.760
- Okay, Jeff, you can say what you're thinking.
- What am I thinking?

01:27:28.071 --> 01:27:31.507
That I haven't got all this
to shoot for anymore.

01:27:33.977 --> 01:27:35.239
But you're wrong, you know.

01:27:37.681 --> 01:27:39.649
Quite wrong.

01:27:40.083 --> 01:27:43.541
What really scares me, here at Spa,
is driving into a cloudburst.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.312
You're doing 160 in the dry...

01:27:45.488 --> 01:27:47.786
then you're suddenly driving
into a wall of rain.

01:27:47.958 --> 01:27:49.755
Can't even see the car in front.

01:27:49.926 --> 01:27:52.121
Just like trying to swim underwater
in the dark.

01:27:52.295 --> 01:27:53.922
Please, Bob, in a moment.

01:27:54.097 --> 01:27:55.792
The point is, gentlemen...

01:27:55.966 --> 01:27:58.901
the road condition on the approach
to the S's before Stavalo...

01:27:59.069 --> 01:28:01.560
have not been improved over last year.

01:28:01.738 --> 01:28:03.069
If anything, they're worse.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.307
But, I must say, I don't see how they could
possibly be worse than last year.

01:28:06.476 --> 01:28:08.706
- Let's write them a letter.
- They file letters.

01:28:08.878 --> 01:28:12.177
A strongly-worded letter,
official, from the Driver Association.

01:28:12.349 --> 01:28:14.783
They have a special file
for strongly-worded letters...

01:28:14.951 --> 01:28:17.852
- ...from the association.
- Are we gonna talk about calling the race off...

01:28:18.021 --> 01:28:19.488
- ...in the event of rain?
- No, no.

01:28:19.656 --> 01:28:21.419
Please, Ritchie,
one thing at a time.

01:28:21.591 --> 01:28:23.582
The subject is road condition.

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.820
They haven't changed the road
in 10 years. They not liable to do it now.

01:28:26.997 --> 01:28:30.057
Look, we all know you're taking your life
in your hands just driving in this course in the rain.

01:28:30.233 --> 01:28:33.430
- So what're we gonna do something?
- A strongly-worded letter, demanding that the road...

01:28:33.603 --> 01:28:35.935
- ...be paved.
- They can't pave the road by tomorrow.

01:28:36.106 --> 01:28:37.764
- So what's the point in talking about it?
- That's what I said.

01:28:37.943 --> 01:28:42.211
But we talk about this business of rain every year.
It's damn well time we did something about it.

01:28:42.379 --> 01:28:44.370
Well, let's demand to cancel it, if it rains.

01:28:44.547 --> 01:28:45.844
You can't cancel of this race.

01:28:46.016 --> 01:28:48.007
- Or postpone it.
- You can't even postpone it.

01:28:49.285 --> 01:28:52.049
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
What about the flag marshaling?

01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:54.679
Hey, look who's here.

01:28:55.859 --> 01:28:57.349
It's Scott.

01:29:02.932 --> 01:29:04.456
Find out which room they're in.

01:29:05.035 --> 01:29:07.026
- Don't be foolish...
- Come on, man, just find out.

01:29:07.203 --> 01:29:10.036
- What are you doing here?
- How are you?

01:29:10.206 --> 01:29:12.037
How are you?

01:29:12.208 --> 01:29:14.676
Hooray! Hooray!

01:29:15.512 --> 01:29:17.002
- Hey, Scott.
- Hi.

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.876
- How are you?
- Hey, Scott.

01:29:20.984 --> 01:29:22.645
How are you?

01:29:22.819 --> 01:29:24.013
How are you?

01:29:27.190 --> 01:29:29.158
Hey, is that you, Pete?

01:29:29.325 --> 01:29:30.553
Better be.

01:29:37.434 --> 01:29:39.163
Meeting over?

01:29:41.705 --> 01:29:43.366
Scott's here.

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:45.235
What?

01:29:46.042 --> 01:29:48.237
We'd better have a talk.

01:30:07.464 --> 01:30:10.058
What you wanna talk about, Pete?

01:30:32.322 --> 01:30:33.880
May I...?

01:30:48.571 --> 01:30:51.665
Really, Scott, this isn't
in very good taste.

01:30:53.743 --> 01:30:55.472
That's very good, darling.

01:30:55.645 --> 01:30:57.840
That's very good.

01:30:58.748 --> 01:31:00.648
Isn't it, Aron?

01:31:01.718 --> 01:31:04.346
I'm afraid you got a point, Scott.

01:31:04.687 --> 01:31:06.154
He has a point.

01:31:07.223 --> 01:31:10.522
- What do you want, Scott?
- You.

01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:18.230
Do you mind, Aron? I'd like
to have a word with my wife alone.

01:31:35.718 --> 01:31:38.380
- I've missed you.
- Well...

01:31:38.555 --> 01:31:40.079
that's a lie for a start.

01:31:40.623 --> 01:31:43.183
Why're you say that? It's true.

01:31:43.493 --> 01:31:47.520
If you've missed me, it's only because you
haven't had your damn cars to fill your life.

01:31:47.697 --> 01:31:50.996
That's all I've ever been good for,
something for you to do between races.

01:31:51.167 --> 01:31:52.896
When will you stop belittling yourself?

01:31:53.336 --> 01:31:55.770
Don't psychoanalyze me.

01:31:56.272 --> 01:31:57.671
I'm sorry.

01:31:57.841 --> 01:32:00.002
I hate that sort of thing myself.

01:32:00.577 --> 01:32:04.013
You walk in here
and calmly ask him to leave...

01:32:04.614 --> 01:32:07.708
and expect me to believe you care
one way or another about me.

01:32:08.017 --> 01:32:11.009
What do you want me to do?
Assault him with my crutches?

01:32:17.427 --> 01:32:21.022
- That's not very funny.
- No, it isn't.

01:32:25.869 --> 01:32:27.803
I do care.

01:32:31.341 --> 01:32:33.104
More than I can talk about.

01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:39.871
But that isn't getting us anywhere, is it?

01:32:41.484 --> 01:32:43.679
I want you back, Pat.

01:32:44.087 --> 01:32:45.611
I'm gonna be driving again pretty soon.

01:32:45.788 --> 01:32:47.415
- I need you with me.
- No, no.

01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:51.720
I've told you, Scott, I can't do it.
I can't live like that.

01:32:51.928 --> 01:32:53.452
I won't.

01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:55.063
What about him? He drives.

01:32:55.965 --> 01:32:58.229
- It's different with him.
- Why?

01:32:59.235 --> 01:33:01.760
- It just is.
- Because you don't love him.

01:33:03.139 --> 01:33:05.664
I don't know what that has
to do with anything.

01:33:08.711 --> 01:33:11.874
You know one of the most
beautiful things about a car?

01:33:12.048 --> 01:33:14.812
If it isn't working properly,
you can strip the skin off...

01:33:15.551 --> 01:33:17.883
expose the insides...

01:33:18.054 --> 01:33:19.988
find out exactly where the trouble is...

01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:23.923
take out the faulty part
and replace it with a new one.

01:33:26.129 --> 01:33:28.620
If only we could do that with people.

01:33:29.165 --> 01:33:30.598
Good luck.

01:33:31.467 --> 01:33:33.628
Luck has nothing to do with this either.

01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:37.866
Bye.

01:33:38.274 --> 01:33:40.936
<i>With Jean-Pierre Sarti's Ferrari</i>
<i>in pole position.</i>

01:33:48.952 --> 01:33:51.580
<i>Ten seconds to the start</i>
<i>of the Belgian Grand Prix.</i>

01:37:24.667 --> 01:37:26.225
<i>Sarti's in the lead at La Source.</i>

01:37:26.402 --> 01:37:29.803
<i>Almost the end of the first lap, and already</i>
<i>he's ahead of the second car.</i>

01:37:29.972 --> 01:37:31.633
<i>It's Pete Aron's Yamura.</i>

01:37:39.048 --> 01:37:42.017
<i>And there's Brabham running right</i>
<i>round the outside of Barlini.</i>

01:37:42.185 --> 01:37:43.447
<i>Brabham in third place...</i>

01:37:43.619 --> 01:37:46.383
<i>but the Ferrari might just take him</i>
<i>again on acceleration.</i>

01:37:46.556 --> 01:37:49.684
<i>They're side by side, down past the pits.</i>
<i>Barlini's going ahead.</i>

01:37:49.859 --> 01:37:54.262
<i>He's out braked Brabham into Eau Rouge,</i>
<i>and it's number seven Ferrari in third place.</i>

01:38:44.313 --> 01:38:47.248
<i>And it's Jean-Pierre Sarti completing</i>
<i>his 16th lap.</i>

01:38:47.416 --> 01:38:49.407
<i>The race is now half over.</i>

01:38:49.585 --> 01:38:53.316
<i>Since the rain began, he's increased</i>
<i>his lead by three or four seconds a lap.</i>

01:38:53.489 --> 01:38:57.118
<i>The worse the conditions,</i>
<i>the bigger the old champion's advantage.</i>

01:38:57.293 --> 01:39:02.162
<i>If the Ferrari keeps going, this will be</i>
<i>his third Grand Prix win of the season.</i>

01:39:15.544 --> 01:39:18.138
<i>Barlini's also very fast in the wet.</i>

01:39:18.314 --> 01:39:20.646
<i>He's now a clear third ahead</i>
<i>of Jack Brabham.</i>

01:39:23.686 --> 01:39:25.813
<i>There's Jochen Rindt coming out</i>
<i>of La Source.</i>

01:39:25.988 --> 01:39:29.355
<i>He lost nearly a lap when he spun</i>
<i>in the worst of the cloudburst.</i>

01:39:29.525 --> 01:39:32.494
<i>And there he is passing Guy Ligier,</i>
<i>moving up another place.</i>

01:40:16.339 --> 01:40:19.831
<i>Here's the leader, completing</i>
<i>his 30th lap. He's got a big lead.</i>

01:40:20.042 --> 01:40:23.409
<i>Jean-Pierre Sarti, winner of Monaco</i>
<i>and French Grand Prixs...</i>

01:40:23.579 --> 01:40:26.707
<i>is only two laps away</i>
<i>from his third consecutive win.</i>

01:42:01.110 --> 01:42:03.305
<i>Here's the winner now.</i>
<i>The Yamura wins...</i>

01:42:03.479 --> 01:42:06.937
<i>and Pete Aron wins the Belgian Grand Prix</i>
<i>in the white Yamura from Japan.</i>

01:42:13.889 --> 01:42:16.323
<i>But as Pete Aron</i>
<i>comes in after his victory...</i>

01:42:16.492 --> 01:42:18.483
<i>there's Izo Yamura...</i>

01:42:18.661 --> 01:42:21.755
<i>going to congratulate him</i>
<i>for bringing the...</i>

01:42:21.931 --> 01:42:25.594
<i>his car home in first place</i>
<i>today in the Belgian Grand Prix.</i>

01:42:25.768 --> 01:42:29.499
<i>Pete Aron, of course, won five Grand Prixs</i>
<i>in the past when he was with Ferraris...</i>

01:42:29.672 --> 01:42:32.971
<i>but that was three years ago.</i>
<i>He's had a lot of bad luck since then.</i>

01:42:33.142 --> 01:42:36.134
<i>It's great to see him back</i>
<i>in the winning position...</i>

01:42:36.312 --> 01:42:39.281
- He drove a good race.
<i>- ...so soon after joining the up-and-coming...</i>

01:42:39.448 --> 01:42:41.279
<i>Yamura team from Japan.</i>

01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:44.214
We'll see how good
he is at Zandvoort.

01:42:45.654 --> 01:42:49.090
<i>Barlini's second place for Ferrari, too,</i>
<i>will be very popular in Italy.</i>

01:42:49.258 --> 01:42:54.696
<i>And there's Aron now, up on the platform</i>
<i>being presented with a garland of flowers...</i>

01:42:54.864 --> 01:42:56.991
<i>and Mr. Yamura joining him.</i>

01:42:57.166 --> 01:43:00.829
<i>Both delighted with the quick success</i>
<i>of this new partnership...</i>

01:43:01.003 --> 01:43:05.963
<i>which has brought Yamura his first</i>
<i>Grand Prix victory after two years of flying.</i>

01:43:06.141 --> 01:43:08.939
<i>He must be very pleased, indeed,</i>
<i>with Aron's performance today.</i>

01:43:09.111 --> 01:43:12.945
<i>The 400 horsepower Yamura,</i>
<i>the most powerful of all the cars in the...</i>

01:43:13.115 --> 01:43:15.140
Albert! Groat!

01:43:19.421 --> 01:43:21.912
- Let him go. Let him go.
<i>- And here's Sarti coming in...</i>

01:43:22.091 --> 01:43:23.319
Are you all right?

01:43:26.929 --> 01:43:30.262
Out of the way.
Out of the way, everybody.

01:43:30.533 --> 01:43:33.525
Children? There were children?

01:43:34.904 --> 01:43:38.340
I'm afraid Paris is impossible
this week, darling.

01:43:38.741 --> 01:43:40.538
I must go right to Modena.

01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:42.438
The car...

01:43:42.611 --> 01:43:45.341
it's completely
wiped out, you see.

01:43:45.848 --> 01:43:48.146
It will be necessary to...

01:43:58.527 --> 01:44:00.188
Stop it, Guido.

01:44:01.897 --> 01:44:03.660
- Stop it.
- Get him out of here.

01:44:08.671 --> 01:44:12.107
It will be necessary to test a new one
for the NÃ¼rburgring.

01:44:12.274 --> 01:44:15.300
A very difficult course,
but one of the most beautiful.

01:44:15.477 --> 01:44:17.911
- You will...
- Oh, stop.

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.085
Thing is, will it start?

01:46:43.397 --> 01:46:44.455
It'll start.

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:56.667
Yeah, Roger had some
very big days in this car.

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:57.313
<i>Coming into the pits now</i>
<i>is Scott Stoddard in the BRM.</i>

01:49:57.490 --> 01:50:00.823
<i>The Dutch Grand Prix, here at Zandvoort</i>
<i>tomorrow, will be his first race...</i>

01:50:00.994 --> 01:50:03.053
<i>since his accident</i>
<i>at Monte Carlo in May.</i>

01:50:03.230 --> 01:50:05.664
<i>His serious injuries</i>
<i>must be extremely painful.</i>

01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:08.665
- How did I do?
- You just set a new lap record.

01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:10.769
<i>The whole BRM crew</i>
<i>look very pleased.</i>

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:12.928
Right, you owe me
a bottle of the best.

01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:14.733
- Yes, indeed I do.
<i>- ...Yamura.</i>

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:17.035
<i>One minute, 26.5 seconds...</i>

01:50:17.210 --> 01:50:19.542
<i>108.5 miles an hour.</i>

01:50:19.713 --> 01:50:23.547
<i>Aron, the American driver, won</i>
<i>the last two Grand Prixs at Spa in Belgium.</i>

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:26.413
<i>And the German Grand Prix last week</i>
<i>at the NÃ¼rburgring.</i>

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:29.419
<i>He now shares the lead</i>
<i>in the World Championship with 18 points.</i>

01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:33.582
<i>Exactly the same as the Ferrari driver,</i>
<i>Jean-Pierre Sarti, the Frenchman.</i>

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.924
<i>Sarti's best practice time so far</i>
<i>on this 2.6 Mile Zandvoort circuit...</i>

01:50:38.098 --> 01:50:40.362
<i>is one minute, 27.1.</i>

01:50:40.533 --> 01:50:44.162
<i>Now, here's Stoddard's best lap.</i>
<i>One minute, 25.9.</i>

01:50:44.337 --> 01:50:46.498
<i>The fastest lap ever on this circuit.</i>

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:49.699
<i>What a wonderful comeback</i>
<i>for this brave young driver.</i>

01:54:20.386 --> 01:54:23.878
What a shame.
He's falling off.

01:54:45.278 --> 01:54:46.267
Cheers.

01:54:46.446 --> 01:54:48.311
Cheers.

01:55:10.136 --> 01:55:11.501
Then it seems to be all right?

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:15.198
Of course it seems to be all right.
It's always all right when you're around.

01:55:15.375 --> 01:55:17.172
Then there is nothing wrong, is there?

01:55:17.343 --> 01:55:20.437
It stuck in practice yesterday,
and it still doesn't feel right.

01:55:20.613 --> 01:55:23.878
- But it doesn't stick now!
- I'm telling you, it does!

01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:27.213
Jean-Pierre, just because
you have been running badly lately...

01:55:27.387 --> 01:55:29.514
it's no reason
to take these things out on me.

01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:31.884
If you want a day off this afternoon,
just say so.

01:55:32.058 --> 01:55:35.459
I'm here to race. Understand?

01:55:35.628 --> 01:55:38.426
- To race.
- Okay, be quiet.

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:46.563
There you are, my beauty.

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:56.815
- See if it's all there, will you, my man?
- It better all be there. Half of it's mine.

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:06.314
Does that look like $17,000 to you?

01:56:07.827 --> 01:56:09.192
Yeah.

01:56:11.931 --> 01:56:13.421
Marvel.

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:18.435
That's what you are, Scott.
A bloody marvel.

01:56:39.926 --> 01:56:44.488
Here. You know,
of course, what you did here.

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:47.325
I know. I don't have to
see it up there to know.

01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:51.696
It's bad enough to lose
without having to watch yourself do it.

01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:53.896
What's the point of this anyway?

01:56:54.073 --> 01:56:59.306
To see if we can determine
why you are losing.

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:02.303
Well, you're not gonna find
the answer up there.

01:57:02.482 --> 01:57:06.612
What about your other two drivers?
Why aren't they here? Why only me?

01:57:06.786 --> 01:57:12.452
Because they are not winners.
But you are.

01:57:12.992 --> 01:57:16.120
You are losing to a man who needs...

01:57:16.295 --> 01:57:20.629
almost to be carried
to and from his car.

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.268
How can that be?

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:29.098
Because he's driving better than I am.
He's making fewer mistakes.

01:57:29.275 --> 01:57:32.403
- That's why anyone wins.
- Exactly.

01:57:32.578 --> 01:57:38.141
Now, shall we turn our attention
to the mistakes?

01:57:52.165 --> 01:57:54.224
About-face.

01:57:56.736 --> 01:58:00.263
By the left, quick march.

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:24.521
<i>Today's British Grand Prix will be Nino</i>
<i>Barlini's first race here at Brands Hatch.</i>

01:58:24.697 --> 01:58:28.224
<i>But his team-mate, Jean-Pierre Sarti</i>
<i>of France, the number-one Ferrari driver...</i>

01:58:28.401 --> 01:58:31.234
<i>and Pete Aron of the Yamura team,</i>
<i>have both driven before...</i>

01:58:31.404 --> 01:58:33.065
<i>here on England's premier circuit.</i>

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:36.470
<i>The second Yamura driver, Tim Randolph,</i>
<i>comes from the United States...</i>

01:58:36.642 --> 01:58:40.806
<i>as does Pete Aron, who's already won</i>
<i>the Belgian and German Grand Prixs.</i>

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:44.677
<i>There are 24 starters in this British Grand</i>
<i>Prix. They're on the dummy grid now...</i>

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:47.445
<i>getting last-minute instructions</i>
<i>from the team managers.</i>

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.178
<i>There's BRM driver, Bob Turner.</i>

01:58:49.388 --> 01:58:52.016
<i>Mr. Yamura himself is with Pete Aron.</i>

01:58:52.191 --> 01:58:55.627
<i>And there's the winner of the last three</i>
<i>Grand Prixs, Scott Stoddard...</i>

01:58:55.795 --> 01:58:58.355
<i>who's still recovering</i>
<i>from his Monte Carlo injuries...</i>

01:58:58.531 --> 01:59:01.091
<i>and leads the World Championship</i>
<i>with two races to go.</i>

01:59:01.267 --> 01:59:04.327
<i>There's Jimmy Clark, the Scotsman,</i>
<i>who has twice been world champion.</i>

01:59:05.072 --> 01:59:08.236
<i>That's the signal to clear the dummy grid.</i>
<i>The engines are starting up now.</i>

01:59:08.408 --> 01:59:10.933
<i>The mechanics and photographers</i>
<i>are moving off the track.</i>

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:18.209
<i>Now the field rolls forward</i>
<i>to the final grid...</i>

01:59:18.384 --> 01:59:22.218
<i>where they'll be held for a few seconds</i>
<i>before the starter drops the Union Jack...</i>

01:59:22.388 --> 01:59:24.686
<i>and then the British Grand Prix</i>
<i>will be under way.</i>

02:01:22.808 --> 02:01:25.242
<i>In the lead after 15 laps</i>
<i>is Scott Stoddard...</i>

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:26.776
<i>but he's losing ground now.</i>

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:29.642
<i>Stoddard, in the dark-green BRM</i>
<i>number four, made a slow start...</i>

02:01:29.815 --> 02:01:31.742
<i>then quickly worked his way up</i>
<i>to the front of the field.</i>

02:01:31.918 --> 02:01:34.609
<i>And during the first 12 laps</i>
<i>he built up a substantial lead.</i>

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:35.818
<i>But his lap times are slower now...</i>

02:01:35.842 --> 02:01:38.018
- His lap times are awfully erratic, Jeff.
- Yeah.

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:41.091
<i>...on the BRM. They're Barlini, number 18,</i>
<i>who was just ahead...</i>

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:45.162
<i>of number 17, Jean-Pierre Sarti,</i>
<i>14, Pete Aron, and 11, Jochen Rindt.</i>

02:01:45.331 --> 02:01:48.789
<i>These three are having a great dice</i>
<i>for third place.</i>

02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:11.318
<i>At Bottom Bend,</i>
<i>Stoddard lost three more places.</i>

02:02:11.491 --> 02:02:13.686
If he keeps missing shifts like that,
the car will level last.

02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:17.393
It'll last longer than he will.
He's finished already.

02:02:17.563 --> 02:02:20.760
<i>Barlini's the leader,</i>
<i>but he's not far ahead of Sarti and Aron.</i>

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:25.103
<i>Here's Stoddard coming into the pits</i>
<i>very slowly.</i>

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:27.671
<i>My goodness, he looks as if</i>
<i>he's on the edge of collapse.</i>

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:31.207
<i>What a shame,</i>
<i>he was driving a beautiful race.</i>

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:38.181
<i>Scott Stoddard</i>
<i>does seem to be in a bad way.</i>

02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:41.912
<i>His retirement certainly puts</i>
<i>a new complexion on the race.</i>

02:02:42.288 --> 02:02:44.982
<i>Barlini leads, but Ferrari team leader</i>
<i>Sarti, Aron...</i>

02:02:45.158 --> 02:02:47.456
<i>and Rindt, all have</i>
<i>the Sicilian in their sights.</i>

02:02:47.627 --> 02:02:50.489
<i>There's a tremendous battle for second place</i>
<i>between Sarti and Aron.</i>

02:02:50.663 --> 02:02:54.155
<i>Although there's one more World</i>
<i>Championship race to go at Monza in Italy...</i>

02:02:54.333 --> 02:02:58.667
<i>the result here at Brands Hatch</i>
<i>is very important to both these men.</i>

02:02:58.838 --> 02:03:02.239
<i>Izo Yamura himself is dedicated to winning</i>
<i>the Constructors Championship...</i>

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:04.638
<i>and Aron is his only hope</i>
<i>here at Brands.</i>

02:03:04.810 --> 02:03:08.576
<i>His second car, driven by Tim Randolph,</i>
<i>blew up its engine early in the race.</i>

02:03:22.828 --> 02:03:24.796
<i>Here comes the leader, Barlini.</i>

02:03:26.632 --> 02:03:29.829
<i>He's not far ahead</i>
<i>of Sarti, Aron and Rindt.</i>

02:03:31.672 --> 02:03:35.004
<i>Last lap. Only one lap to go.</i>
<i>Sarti and Aron are very close to Barlini now.</i>

02:03:35.174 --> 02:03:36.903
- The last lap.
<i>- But Aron hasn't a chance...</i>

02:03:37.076 --> 02:03:40.045
<i>of getting past both Ferraris. This is</i>
<i>going to be the most exciting finish...</i>

02:03:40.213 --> 02:03:42.272
<i>of the Grand Prix season so far.</i>

02:03:53.058 --> 02:03:56.994
<i>At Bottom Bend, the first four</i>
<i>are nose-to-tail: Barlini, Sarti, Aron, Rindt.</i>

02:04:00.032 --> 02:04:01.829
<i>Barlini dare not let Sarti through.</i>

02:04:02.001 --> 02:04:04.401
<i>It's much too dodgy</i>
<i>with the Yamura right behind.</i>

02:04:05.071 --> 02:04:08.529
Look. He's spilling something.
Looks like fuel.

02:04:08.707 --> 02:04:09.935
Gas leaking?

02:04:34.733 --> 02:04:37.133
<i>As they come into Clearways,</i>
<i>Barlini's still in front.</i>

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:39.271
<i>The Yamura's smoking badly. It's on fire.</i>

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:40.837
He's on fire!

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:43.839
<i>The Yamura's second,</i>
<i>ahead of Sarti's Ferrari. It's on fire.</i>

02:04:44.009 --> 02:04:46.978
<i>It's well and truly on fire.</i>
<i>But Aron's not slowing.</i>

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:51.139
<i>He's gonna beat Sarti to the finish.</i>
<i>There's the flag, Barlini wins for Ferrari.</i>

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:53.551
<i>Aron's second and Sarti third.</i>

02:04:53.719 --> 02:04:55.443
<i>Now, the Yamura's</i>
<i>pulling off the track.</i>

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:59.284
<i>There are flames shooting out of the back</i>
<i>of the car. Let's hope Aron can get out.</i>

02:04:59.458 --> 02:05:01.949
<i>There's a fire crew right there.</i>
<i>He should be all right.</i>

02:05:02.128 --> 02:05:04.762
<i>He's rolled out of the car.</i>
<i>Keep back. Keep back.</i>

02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:08.864
<i>What a shambles. Some of the crowd</i>
<i>are rushing to the fire, and Sarti's stopping.</i>

02:05:09.035 --> 02:05:11.396
<i>He's going to see</i>
<i>if there's anything he can do for Aron.</i>

02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:14.630
<i>Izo Yamura's also running</i>
<i>across the track with Tim Randolph.</i>

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:17.207
<i>From here, it looks</i>
<i>as though Pete Aron's on his feet.</i>

02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:19.241
<i>- He must be okay but I tell you...</i>
- Are you all right?

02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:21.538
- I'm okay.
<i>- ...for the last few seconds of the race.</i>

02:05:21.714 --> 02:05:23.182
I'm okay. I'm okay.

02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:25.942
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, what'd we make?

02:05:26.118 --> 02:05:28.245
- Second.
- I'm a regular ball of fire.

02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:31.189
<i>A fire like this is what these drivers</i>
<i>are most afraid of.</i>

02:05:31.357 --> 02:05:34.651
<i>Nowadays their fireproof no make overalls</i>
<i>give them a good deal of protection.</i>

02:05:34.827 --> 02:05:36.954
- Get out of here!
<i>- Photographers must keep back.</i>

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:38.960
<i>Please keep back.</i>

02:05:46.205 --> 02:05:50.266
<i>Nino Barlini's up there on the trailer</i>
<i>ready to go around on his lap of honor.</i>

02:05:50.442 --> 02:05:53.536
<i>The team manager of Ferrari is there too.</i>

02:05:54.813 --> 02:05:59.477
<i>And there's a beautiful bird coming up</i>
<i>to join him on the trailer up there.</i>

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.212
Hey, Nino.

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:05.914
Nino Barlini, excuse me. Congratulations.

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:08.218
- How do you feel after that splendid victory?
- Thank you.

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:12.763
My neck hurts, my leg.
My hand is bleeding. And I feel wonderful.

02:06:12.932 --> 02:06:15.423
Well, I don't know
if you've had time to realize it...

02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:18.764
but this means that you're one point
ahead of Sarti and Stoddard...

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:22.203
- ...two points ahead of Pete Aron.
- Of course I realize it.

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:24.774
And with one race to go at Monza...

02:06:24.944 --> 02:06:27.879
the man who wins at Monza
will be the world champion.

02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:29.674
I am the man.

02:06:29.848 --> 02:06:33.340
So long, Nino. Congratulations.

02:06:35.221 --> 02:06:38.054
I feel wonderful.

02:07:09.455 --> 02:07:10.854
Yeah, come in.

02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:24.396
How are you?

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:33.542
I'm pretty bloody awful.

02:07:34.046 --> 02:07:35.707
How are you?

02:07:53.132 --> 02:07:54.895
Would you...

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:56.432
care to sit down?

02:08:03.809 --> 02:08:06.073
This has been a ridiculous few weeks,
hasn't it?

02:08:07.479 --> 02:08:08.605
Has it?

02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:14.143
Well, I mean, seeing each other
at the races and not...

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:17.221
Well, ignoring each other.

02:08:18.791 --> 02:08:20.486
Trying to.

02:08:25.898 --> 02:08:28.594
I've been alone.

02:08:29.268 --> 02:08:31.429
You know that, don't you?

02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:34.901
Yeah. Here.

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:40.308
- Pete said you had guts, and I...
- I'm not really interested in what he said.

02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:43.877
I certainly don't want to discuss him
with you. I've told you that.

02:08:44.049 --> 02:08:45.607
I didn't mean...

02:08:46.885 --> 02:08:50.412
I meant that when he said you had guts,
I said you were only stubborn.

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:54.218
I just wanted to tell you
that he was right and I was wrong.

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:58.630
Watching what you've been doing
these past few weeks...

02:09:00.199 --> 02:09:02.429
You shouldn't have been doing it alone.

02:09:02.968 --> 02:09:05.334
Yeah, there's only room for one
in the car, you know.

02:09:05.604 --> 02:09:08.732
- I don't mean that. You know I don't.
- I know.

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:11.438
It was a joke.

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:14.971
Do you still want me, Scott?

02:09:20.119 --> 02:09:21.643
Yes.

02:09:23.722 --> 02:09:26.691
I still feel the same
about what you're doing.

02:09:26.859 --> 02:09:29.350
That hasn't changed, you know.

02:09:29.528 --> 02:09:30.825
I think you're a fool.

02:09:31.964 --> 02:09:33.898
Yeah, I know.

02:09:36.201 --> 02:09:38.032
But...

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:42.566
I haven't changed either, you know.

02:09:43.909 --> 02:09:45.467
I mean...

02:09:49.248 --> 02:09:51.716
I really can't promise you anything.

02:09:51.884 --> 02:09:53.818
That's all right.

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:58.278
That's the problem, really.
People promise each other too much.

02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:07.187
What's wrong, Jean-Pierre?

02:11:08.861 --> 02:11:10.556
What is it?

02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:16.760
There's nothing you can do
about what's wrong with me, Louise.

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:20.132
I won't admit that
until I know what's troubling you.

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.967
I suppose what's wrong with me
is my life.

02:11:25.210 --> 02:11:28.976
But I can't change it. Or won't.

02:11:30.282 --> 02:11:33.115
So there's nothing you can do for me.

02:11:34.653 --> 02:11:36.883
What's wrong with your life?

02:11:37.823 --> 02:11:41.384
I've begun to see the absurdity of it.

02:11:42.294 --> 02:11:44.194
All of us.

02:11:46.465 --> 02:11:48.456
Proving what?

02:11:49.101 --> 02:11:50.864
That we can go faster?

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:53.561
And perhaps remain alive?

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:58.671
Nino, gambling his life for a trophy...

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:01.438
then fills it with beer and does tricks.

02:12:01.847 --> 02:12:05.044
Stoddard, filling himself with drugs
in order to drive...

02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:07.242
and still passing out with the pain.

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:10.513
Don't you see how absurd it all is?
Who cares?

02:12:11.924 --> 02:12:13.858
I thought you cared.

02:12:14.059 --> 02:12:16.084
For yourselves.

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:20.062
I didn't know you asked it
of anyone else.

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:22.926
Nevertheless, others do care.

02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:24.898
A hundred thousand
of them cared today.

02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:28.506
And did you see them rush
to see Peter burn?

02:12:28.674 --> 02:12:33.043
Did you see the looks
on their faces? I saw.

02:12:33.211 --> 02:12:36.874
For the first time today,
I really saw those faces.

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:38.607
But not all of them, Jean-Pierre.

02:12:38.784 --> 02:12:43.244
There are some who come for that,
for the accidents and the fires.

02:12:44.957 --> 02:12:49.587
But the others,
the others ride with you, maybe.

02:12:50.495 --> 02:12:55.296
You put something in their lives
that they can't put there themselves.

02:12:57.169 --> 02:12:58.602
Are you one of those?

02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:04.737
It doesn't matter.

02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:09.036
Yes, it does.

02:13:09.848 --> 02:13:12.373
Maybe I am one of those.

02:13:13.485 --> 02:13:16.784
When I came here three months ago...

02:13:16.955 --> 02:13:22.757
there was a place in my life
that needed to be filled.

02:13:23.595 --> 02:13:24.584
You've done that.

02:13:26.665 --> 02:13:30.567
You and, I suppose,
the excitement of what you do.

02:13:31.703 --> 02:13:33.500
But you offered me these things, Jean-Pierre.

02:13:33.672 --> 02:13:37.073
You can't condemn me now
for having accepted them.

02:13:37.376 --> 02:13:40.937
No, I don't condemn you
for that, darling.

02:13:41.647 --> 02:13:43.205
Sorry.

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:51.218
Jean-Pierre, you can stop.

02:13:52.424 --> 02:13:57.088
If you feel as you do,
you could stop now.

02:13:59.498 --> 02:14:03.958
No, it's not so easy.

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:07.699
Not so easy.

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:13.210
Not so easy.

02:14:17.382 --> 02:14:19.543
<i>With the Italian Grand Prix</i>
<i>at the Monza Autodrome...</i>

02:14:19.718 --> 02:14:22.983
<i>they're using a combination</i>
<i>of the banked oval high-speed track...</i>

02:14:23.155 --> 02:14:24.713
<i>and the road circuit.</i>

02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:27.222
<i>The whole thing comes</i>
<i>to almost six and a quarter miles...</i>

02:14:27.392 --> 02:14:30.259
<i>just over half of this length</i>
<i>being the road circuit...</i>

02:14:30.429 --> 02:14:32.897
<i>with its fast corners</i>
<i>and long straights.</i>

02:14:33.065 --> 02:14:35.693
<i>By itself, it's one of the</i>
<i>fastest circuits in the world.</i>

02:14:35.867 --> 02:14:40.065
<i>And combined with the oval track,</i>
<i>it should give some phenomenal speeds.</i>

02:14:57.656 --> 02:15:00.386
Why hasn't my car arrived, Guido?

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:03.289
It's no longer in my hands,
Jean-Pierre.

02:15:33.925 --> 02:15:35.358
What's the trouble?

02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:38.963
My car hasn't arrived
from the factory.

02:15:39.564 --> 02:15:41.532
The same thing
has happened before.

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:45.864
Not to me, but to other drivers
who have fallen from grace.

02:15:46.071 --> 02:15:47.368
Pressure.

02:15:47.539 --> 02:15:48.972
Pressure?

02:15:49.141 --> 02:15:51.735
Isn't there enough of that as it is?

02:15:52.177 --> 02:15:56.113
You have to grasp the mind
of Signor Manetta, my darling.

02:15:56.381 --> 02:15:58.542
If a driver can be reached
by those tactics...

02:15:58.717 --> 02:16:01.982
it means he probably will fear
for his place on the team.

02:16:02.154 --> 02:16:04.554
That is exactly
what Manetta wants.

02:16:04.723 --> 02:16:08.352
Because that driver will try
all the harder to win.

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:12.930
He will perhaps take a risk
which he would ordinarily avoid.

02:16:13.098 --> 02:16:17.467
And risks are always risks.

02:16:19.171 --> 02:16:21.264
But the car will come.

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:24.931
Well, if it doesn't,
I'll use my influence...

02:16:25.110 --> 02:16:28.273
and I'll get you the best seat
in the grandstand.

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:40.218
- No sign of it?
- No.

02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:43.555
Don't worry, Jean-Pierre.
That's what they want you to do.

02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:46.627
He makes a great mistake, then.

02:16:59.611 --> 02:17:02.409
Are you sure
you wanted it to come?

02:17:10.388 --> 02:17:14.950
<i>A maximum of about 180 miles an hour</i>
<i>can be expected from these 3-liter cars...</i>

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:17.719
<i>on this high banking,</i>
<i>where they get...</i>

02:17:18.063 --> 02:17:22.727
<i>a tremendous pounding from the rough surface and</i>
<i>the strain imposed by centrifugal force...</i>

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:25.392
<i>before they swoop down</i>
<i>onto the road circuit again...</i>

02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:28.800
<i>where cornering power</i>
<i>handling are at the premium.</i>

02:17:42.254 --> 02:17:46.156
- Good afternoon, Nino.
- Madame Sarti.

02:18:08.046 --> 02:18:10.981
Have you met Miss Frederickson?
Madame Sarti.

02:18:13.251 --> 02:18:17.187
- Hello, Monique.
- Hello, Louise.

02:18:18.757 --> 02:18:21.590
So you are leading in points
for the championship, Nino.

02:18:22.059 --> 02:18:25.860
But not by as many points
as I would like, Madame Sarti.

02:18:26.197 --> 02:18:29.064
All you have to do
is to beat my husband.

02:18:29.734 --> 02:18:32.531
The question is,
is he ready to be beaten?

02:18:37.642 --> 02:18:41.806
Please excuse me,
I have some work to do back at the hotel.

02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:45.081
- Nino, tell Jean-Pierre...
- Yes, yes.

02:18:51.957 --> 02:18:55.255
- She's quite good-looking, isn't she?
- Yes.

02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:59.421
Of course, for one
who cares for the type.

02:19:00.699 --> 02:19:04.294
Yes. Excuse me,
Madame Sarti.

02:19:25.223 --> 02:19:28.590
Oh, no, wait.
Let me stand... It's better?

02:19:35.433 --> 02:19:39.893
The question is, Jean-Pierre,
what are you going to do about it?

02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:42.004
Do?
I don't understand.

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:45.906
The time for losing comes
to every man, of course.

02:19:46.076 --> 02:19:49.171
I had not expected yours
to come so soon.

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:51.514
There have been problems with the car.

02:19:51.683 --> 02:19:53.048
Come, come, Sarti.

02:19:53.218 --> 02:19:56.619
I expect excuses like that
from lesser men than you.

02:19:57.255 --> 02:19:59.780
You've been one of the best
that ever lived.

02:19:59.991 --> 02:20:02.687
There is no question of that
in my mind.

02:20:02.861 --> 02:20:07.958
Never a wrong move, the concentration
always there, 100 percent.

02:20:09.067 --> 02:20:11.058
Until this woman.

02:20:11.436 --> 02:20:14.405
You have been misled,
Signor Manetta.

02:20:14.572 --> 02:20:17.905
You take me for a trained dog
to jump at the snap of your fingers?

02:20:18.076 --> 02:20:20.044
My life belongs
to no one but myself.

02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:24.170
I've been thinking seriously
of your retirement, Sarti.

02:20:24.482 --> 02:20:25.779
Then retire me now.

02:20:28.453 --> 02:20:30.978
Kindly lower your voice.

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:33.214
Of course I will not retire you now.

02:20:33.391 --> 02:20:35.154
Tomorrow there is a race to be run.

02:20:35.326 --> 02:20:38.955
And I also well know
that you want to drive it.

02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:44.929
But after tomorrow,
who knows, Jean-Pierre?

02:20:45.970 --> 02:20:50.771
After tomorrow, Signor Manetta,
I will decide to retire or not.

02:20:50.942 --> 02:20:54.673
Sarti, you are even further gone
than I thought.

02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:57.848
A pity.
A great pity.

02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:02.008
I always considered you
to be the best.

02:21:03.888 --> 02:21:05.412
I'm still the best.

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:20.327
What brings you
to Monza, Monique?

02:21:21.606 --> 02:21:24.905
- Business, of course.
- Of course.

02:21:47.065 --> 02:21:49.226
Nino wonders if you're ready
to be beaten.

02:21:50.735 --> 02:21:52.862
No one is ever ready for that.

02:21:54.873 --> 02:21:57.740
You will never retire,
Jean-Pierre.

02:21:57.909 --> 02:22:00.434
What does it matter to you, Monique?

02:22:00.612 --> 02:22:01.636
- To me?
- Yeah.

02:22:03.214 --> 02:22:06.377
As always, as a hero,
you're a good asset to the company.

02:22:07.886 --> 02:22:12.186
Well, perhaps I'm tired
of being an asset for the company.

02:22:12.357 --> 02:22:16.794
And tired too, of this farce we perform,
you and I, for public consumption.

02:22:16.961 --> 02:22:21.455
But it doesn't really matter that you
are tired of these things, Jean-Pierre.

02:22:21.633 --> 02:22:27.230
If you should decide not to continue
with the... The farce, as you call it...

02:22:27.539 --> 02:22:29.598
that, of course, is entirely up to you.

02:22:31.009 --> 02:22:32.943
But it will make no difference.

02:22:33.111 --> 02:22:34.703
As long as you're my husband...

02:22:34.879 --> 02:22:38.406
the company will have the prestige
of your name and...

02:22:38.683 --> 02:22:43.245
whether or not, you ever step
into one of these again.

02:22:44.022 --> 02:22:47.014
And you will always be my husband.

02:22:47.525 --> 02:22:48.924
You know that, don't you?

02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:56.890
This one,
she may be different to you...

02:22:57.268 --> 02:22:59.429
but not to me.

02:22:59.871 --> 02:23:03.363
To me, she is just like all the others.

02:23:04.275 --> 02:23:07.108
And we will always be married,
you and I.

02:23:07.812 --> 02:23:09.302
Stay away from me, Monique.

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:10.606
Let me alone, please.

02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:19.284
Tell me. What terrible thing
have I done to you...

02:23:19.457 --> 02:23:24.087
that makes you want to nail me
to this absurd life we have together?

02:23:25.296 --> 02:23:26.991
What terrible thing, Monique?

02:23:33.805 --> 02:23:36.365
Do you think it's been worth it, Pat?

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:39.305
All the effort,
even if I win tomorrow?

02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:41.444
Worth it to you?

02:23:42.614 --> 02:23:45.048
Only you can know that, Scott.

02:23:45.817 --> 02:23:46.909
Yeah, I suppose so.

02:23:49.654 --> 02:23:52.817
Well, let's go and have a party.

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:56.085
Scott, are you sure you want to go?

02:23:56.261 --> 02:23:58.195
Wouldn't you rather rest?

02:23:58.363 --> 02:24:01.958
After tomorrow, I shall be
a long time resting. Come on.

02:24:06.271 --> 02:24:08.068
Have I thanked you?

02:24:08.273 --> 02:24:09.331
For what?

02:24:11.576 --> 02:24:12.975
For being here.

02:24:22.287 --> 02:24:23.948
Thank you.

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:33.824
Hey, <i>sayonara.</i>

02:24:33.998 --> 02:24:36.899
My goodness, Nino. I thought
they belonged to the Yamura boys.

02:24:37.068 --> 02:24:38.899
I have them on temporary loan.

02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:42.130
- Really? Two of them?
- They are very small.

02:24:42.307 --> 02:24:44.605
See you later, maybe.

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:48.330
Can I buy you a drink?

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:51.474
I don't drink.

02:25:58.950 --> 02:26:01.009
I don't smoke.

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:27.171
The end?

02:26:29.213 --> 02:26:31.078
The end.

02:26:36.254 --> 02:26:39.917
I looked at the photographs last night.
Very good.

02:26:41.092 --> 02:26:42.457
Thank you.

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:45.653
And what you wrote,
also very good.

02:26:51.436 --> 02:26:55.873
Well, your work may be finished,
but mine is not.

02:26:58.443 --> 02:27:00.308
It's time.

02:27:00.645 --> 02:27:02.579
I don't want to see the race, Jean-Pierre.

02:27:04.382 --> 02:27:05.781
Why not?

02:27:06.984 --> 02:27:09.282
Because I'm ashamed.

02:27:11.155 --> 02:27:13.123
Ashamed?

02:27:14.258 --> 02:27:15.350
Of what?

02:27:16.093 --> 02:27:18.926
Of what it's meant to be, I suppose.

02:27:19.096 --> 02:27:20.791
The racing.

02:27:21.299 --> 02:27:25.998
And now, knowing
what it means to you, the uncertainty.

02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:29.435
I don't want to watch anymore.
Ever.

02:27:34.846 --> 02:27:36.905
You're being very foolish, you know.

02:27:38.082 --> 02:27:39.640
Let me be foolish, then.

02:27:41.352 --> 02:27:45.288
I'm going to win today.
You don't want to miss that, do you?

02:27:45.823 --> 02:27:48.587
Please, Jean-Pierre.
I don't want to go.

02:27:57.201 --> 02:27:59.032
Well...

02:28:03.508 --> 02:28:05.669
to work, then.

02:28:10.915 --> 02:28:12.280
I love you, Jean-Pierre.

02:28:15.753 --> 02:28:16.777
And I you.

02:28:22.326 --> 02:28:27.294
We'll have to discuss the consequences
of those terrible words?

02:28:52.957 --> 02:28:55.118
Hey, where were you last night?

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:58.288
- Where were you?
- Come here.

02:29:05.036 --> 02:29:08.938
Am I expected to account
for my whereabouts at every moment?

02:29:09.106 --> 02:29:11.939
- Am I?
- It is not the same thing.

02:29:12.109 --> 02:29:13.804
You are a woman.

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:17.647
- I'm leaving you.
- Leaving? For how long?

02:29:17.949 --> 02:29:21.180
For always, you fool.
Forever.

02:29:27.224 --> 02:29:30.159
I met a boy, an American...

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:33.923
who wants to go to the Greek islands
and dive for relics.

02:29:35.066 --> 02:29:38.524
In the first place,
diving is a great bore.

02:29:38.803 --> 02:29:41.704
How do you know?
Have you ever done it?

02:29:41.872 --> 02:29:44.739
Some things one can tell
without doing them...

02:29:44.909 --> 02:29:47.343
that they will be a great bore.

02:29:47.511 --> 02:29:50.344
Underwater is for fish, not people.

02:29:50.514 --> 02:29:53.574
In the second place,
they are not relics at all.

02:29:54.018 --> 02:29:56.953
I have on good authority
from a close friend...

02:29:57.254 --> 02:30:01.315
that these things are manufactured
and then dumped into the water...

02:30:01.492 --> 02:30:04.484
to be found by foolish
American boy tourists.

02:30:04.662 --> 02:30:07.062
And the girls who are foolish enough
to go with them.

02:30:07.598 --> 02:30:10.396
This is the most ridiculous thing
I ever heard.

02:30:10.568 --> 02:30:14.436
I have it on very good authority
from a close friend.

02:30:17.308 --> 02:30:19.071
Do you want me to stay?

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:22.106
You are old enough
to make your own decisions.

02:30:23.981 --> 02:30:26.541
Then I'm going, all right?

02:30:27.251 --> 02:30:30.778
Yes, I definitely think you should go
to the Greek islands...

02:30:30.955 --> 02:30:33.549
with your American boyfriend.

02:30:33.724 --> 02:30:35.954
I think you should go to hell.

02:30:56.213 --> 02:30:57.680
You gonna be in the pits today?

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:13.496
<i>The last time this combined circuit</i>
<i>was used was in 1961.</i>

02:31:13.864 --> 02:31:15.591
<i>There were objections</i>
<i>from drivers who thought...</i>

02:31:15.766 --> 02:31:18.867
<i>the light one-and-a-half liter</i>
<i>Formula 1 cars of that time...</i>

02:31:19.036 --> 02:31:21.630
<i>were not suitable for the strain</i>
<i>imposed by the banking.</i>

02:31:21.806 --> 02:31:24.707
<i>Bearing in mind, the suspension</i>
<i>had to be a compromise setting...</i>

02:31:24.875 --> 02:31:27.343
<i>to allow for effective cornering</i>
<i>on the road section as well.</i>

02:31:28.079 --> 02:31:30.476
<i>However the bigger cars</i>
<i>of the present formula...</i>

02:31:30.648 --> 02:31:33.811
<i>should be better able</i>
<i>to stand up to the conditions.</i>

02:31:37.254 --> 02:31:39.279
Hi, Pat.
How are you?

02:31:39.457 --> 02:31:43.325
- I'm okay. You?
- All right.

02:31:44.095 --> 02:31:46.495
Hope he beats you
by at least 10 laps today.

02:31:48.065 --> 02:31:49.999
I'm glad you feel that way.

02:31:50.234 --> 02:31:51.633
What if he doesn't?

02:31:52.269 --> 02:31:54.134
We'll survive it one way or another.

02:31:56.373 --> 02:31:57.567
Good luck.

02:32:45.856 --> 02:32:48.620
<i>Scott Stoddard has 27 points</i>
<i>in the championship...</i>

02:32:48.793 --> 02:32:50.693
<i>exactly the same as Jean-Pierre Sarti.</i>

02:32:50.861 --> 02:32:55.230
<i>In the lead with 28 points is Nino Barlini,</i>
<i>while Pete Aron has 26.</i>

02:32:55.733 --> 02:32:59.362
<i>In just two hours, one of these men</i>
<i>will be the new world champion.</i>

02:33:04.642 --> 02:33:05.836
<i>They're off.</i>

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:10.312
<i>Sarti is stalled.</i>

02:33:10.481 --> 02:33:11.778
<i>He can't get away.</i>

02:33:13.417 --> 02:33:18.286
Go away! You will disqualify me!
No, no! No!

02:33:26.964 --> 02:33:28.727
<i>Sarti's away at last.</i>

02:33:29.066 --> 02:33:31.027
<i>And the leaders are onto the banking</i>
<i>for the first time...</i>

02:33:31.202 --> 02:33:34.565
<i>with Barlini's Ferrari in front</i>
<i>of Stoddard's BRM and Aron's Yamura.</i>

02:33:34.738 --> 02:33:36.535
<i>Then Brabham, Gurney and Scarfiotti.</i>

02:33:36.707 --> 02:33:41.371
<i>The order's Barlini, Stoddard,</i>
<i>Aron, Brabham, Gurney, Scarfiotti.</i>

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:17.143
<i>And tell me, Scott...</i>

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:21.478
<i>are there any particular problems</i>
<i>in driving on the Monza banking?</i>

02:34:22.019 --> 02:34:23.782
<i>The banking?</i>

02:34:24.088 --> 02:34:27.854
<i>It's just so damn rough up there,</i>
<i>and that the car flicks all over the place.</i>

02:34:28.025 --> 02:34:29.925
<i>We're never below 180, you know.</i>

02:34:30.094 --> 02:34:32.460
<i>At that speed, your reactions</i>
<i>can barely keep up...</i>

02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:34.791
<i>with these sudden changes in direction.</i>

02:34:34.965 --> 02:34:38.560
<i>The trouble is, the high centrifugal forces</i>
<i>push the car into the banking...</i>

02:34:38.736 --> 02:34:40.795
<i>and use up</i>
<i>all the suspension movement.</i>

02:34:40.971 --> 02:34:43.997
<i>So, what you're driving</i>
<i>becomes a car with no springs.</i>

02:34:44.174 --> 02:34:47.166
<i>It feels like you're getting a series</i>
<i>of punches in the back.</i>

02:34:47.344 --> 02:34:49.175
<i>I hate it. I'm sick of pain.</i>

02:34:49.446 --> 02:34:52.347
<i>But it's what the car is suffering</i>
<i>that really worries me.</i>

02:34:52.516 --> 02:34:54.347
<i>Because no matter how the car</i>
<i>is set up...</i>

02:34:54.518 --> 02:34:56.645
<i>it bottoms at several places</i>
<i>on both bankings.</i>

02:34:56.820 --> 02:35:00.085
<i>The underside of the car just comes</i>
<i>crashing down onto the biggest bumps.</i>

02:35:00.257 --> 02:35:02.851
<i>Everything's shaking</i>
<i>and banging all the time.</i>

02:35:03.027 --> 02:35:06.155
<i>Sometimes you could swear</i>
<i>the whole thing's falling to bits.</i>

02:35:49.673 --> 02:35:51.334
<i>On none of us</i>
<i>like Monza very much.</i>

02:35:51.508 --> 02:35:54.443
<i>It's so damn fast</i>
<i>and they run so close together...</i>

02:35:54.611 --> 02:36:00.277
<i>it requires fantastic concentration</i>
<i>and rather special skills.</i>

02:36:00.451 --> 02:36:02.112
<i>It's slipstreaming, for instance.</i>

02:36:02.286 --> 02:36:07.883
<i>At speeds reaching 180 miles an hour,</i>
<i>race car's making a big hole in the air.</i>

02:36:08.058 --> 02:36:13.155
<i>As the car goes through, the air rushes back</i>
<i>into the hole and creates a hell of a draft.</i>

02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:16.458
<i>And that draft's strong enough to pull</i>
<i>a following car along at...</i>

02:36:16.633 --> 02:36:19.796
<i>Oh, 10 miles</i>
<i>more than his usual top speed.</i>

02:36:20.304 --> 02:36:23.364
<i>If yours is the last car in a bunch,</i>
<i>you can get a terrific tow.</i>

02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:26.941
<i>You can back way off the gas pedal</i>
<i>and maintain the same speed.</i>

02:36:27.378 --> 02:36:28.902
<i>Then you can put your foot down...</i>

02:36:29.079 --> 02:36:33.880
<i>pull out of the slipstream and maybe</i>
<i>overtake two, three cars at once.</i>

02:36:34.051 --> 02:36:37.509
<i>The only thing to do here is to drive</i>
<i>just as fast as you know how...</i>

02:36:37.688 --> 02:36:39.349
<i>and hope your car doesn't break.</i>

02:38:27.564 --> 02:38:30.562
<i>At the end of the fifth lap,</i>
<i>Barlini's in the lead by five seconds.</i>

02:38:31.168 --> 02:38:34.103
<i>Now both Stoddard and Aron</i>
<i>have lost the Ferrari's slipstream.</i>

02:38:34.271 --> 02:38:37.069
<i>And they're dropping back</i>
<i>in their great dice for second place.</i>

02:39:03.233 --> 02:39:08.170
<i>And coming up the main straight now is number four,</i>
<i>Jean-Pierre Sarti's Ferrari in 14th place.</i>

02:39:08.338 --> 02:39:11.307
<i>With 10 laps gone</i>
<i>and only 18 seconds behind Barlini...</i>

02:39:11.475 --> 02:39:14.774
<i>after losing nearly half a minute</i>
<i>when his engine stalled at the start.</i>

02:39:14.945 --> 02:39:18.608
<i>With 40 laps to go, Sarti could still</i>
<i>catch the leader and win the race.</i>

02:40:04.861 --> 02:40:07.329
Are you never afraid?

02:40:08.031 --> 02:40:09.658
Not ever.

02:40:09.833 --> 02:40:11.391
Why?

02:40:12.569 --> 02:40:17.370
Because I am immortal.

02:40:26.049 --> 02:40:29.314
Why do you drive racing cars?

02:40:29.953 --> 02:40:32.786
Or do you not think about it?

02:40:33.056 --> 02:40:36.992
Well, Mr. Yamura,
I don't think there's one of us...

02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:40.755
who doesn't ask himself
at least once in the middle of a race:

02:40:40.931 --> 02:40:43.399
"What the hell am I doing here?"

02:40:43.667 --> 02:40:49.333
Of course, when it's over, we conveniently
forget that we ask ourselves that question.

02:40:50.274 --> 02:40:52.538
I think about it.

02:40:52.776 --> 02:40:55.267
There are a lot of reasons, I don't know.

02:40:55.445 --> 02:40:58.812
Maybe to do something...

02:40:58.982 --> 02:41:04.215
that brings you so close to
the possibility of death and to survive it...

02:41:04.388 --> 02:41:08.518
is to feel life and living
so much more intensely.

02:41:19.536 --> 02:41:22.767
- Be careful there, it's slippery.
- Okay.

02:41:25.042 --> 02:41:27.340
Can you manage all right?

02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:33.845
I'm all right. It's okay.

02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:38.081
I'll get Thompson to bring lunch up.

02:41:38.255 --> 02:41:40.815
- I'll eat downstairs, Mom.
- You can't go downstairs again.

02:41:40.991 --> 02:41:43.983
Look, I'm getting up the stairs,
I can certainly get down them.

02:41:46.196 --> 02:41:49.427
If worse comes to the worse, I can
always slide down the banisters.

02:41:49.599 --> 02:41:52.159
- Right?
- Yes.

02:42:30.941 --> 02:42:33.034
This isn't good,
you know, what I feel now.

02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:34.507
What do you feel?

02:42:34.678 --> 02:42:38.046
That I would almost rather stay
here with you than get into the car.

02:42:38.215 --> 02:42:40.512
Ah, almost.

02:42:40.817 --> 02:42:45.481
I suppose at my age, one moves
slowly from one habit to the next.

02:42:45.856 --> 02:42:46.845
I must go, darling.

02:43:35.639 --> 02:43:37.607
<i>There's Barlini on his 17th lap.</i>

02:43:37.774 --> 02:43:41.039
<i>His Ferrari is just a bit too fast,</i>
<i>even for Pete Aron's Yamura...</i>

02:43:41.211 --> 02:43:42.644
<i>and Scott Stoddard's BRM.</i>

02:43:42.813 --> 02:43:44.474
<i>They're in second and third places.</i>

02:43:44.648 --> 02:43:48.709
<i>There's a splendid scrap for fourth place,</i>
<i>with Tim Randolph in the second Yamura...</i>

02:43:48.885 --> 02:43:52.753
<i>just ahead of Dan Gurney in the Eagle,</i>
<i>and Bob Turner in the other BRM.</i>

02:44:20.484 --> 02:44:22.042
<i>As they sweep around the banking this time...</i>

02:44:22.219 --> 02:44:25.416
<i>Sarti's gonna catch up with the three cars</i>
<i>fighting for fourth place.</i>

02:44:25.589 --> 02:44:29.457
<i>He's passed Tim Randolph from the Japanese Yamura,</i>
<i>now watch him go underneath Gurney in the Eagle.</i>

02:44:29.626 --> 02:44:32.527
<i>Yes, he's passed him, and now</i>
<i>he's passing Bob Turner in the BRM.</i>

02:44:32.696 --> 02:44:33.924
<i>He's fourth. Sarti's fourth.</i>

02:44:34.564 --> 02:44:37.124
<i>There are three slow cars just in front.</i>
<i>When Sarti's lapped them...</i>

02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:40.963
<i>he'll only have Aron and Stoddard</i>
<i>between him and the leader, Barlini.</i>

02:45:57.581 --> 02:45:59.811
<i>We've just heard</i>
<i>there's been an accident.</i>

02:46:01.651 --> 02:46:05.553
<i>It's Sarti. Sarti's Ferrari</i>
<i>has gone clean over the north banking...</i>

02:46:05.722 --> 02:46:08.885
<i>and landed at the side</i>
<i>of the track below. Then it caught fire.</i>

02:46:26.743 --> 02:46:28.540
Oh, Jean-Pierre!

02:46:31.181 --> 02:46:32.705
Oh, Jean-Pierre.

02:46:32.882 --> 02:46:35.510
Jean-Pierre. Oh, Jean-Pierre.

02:46:35.885 --> 02:46:37.648
Oh, Jean-Pierre.

02:46:37.821 --> 02:46:42.121
No. No!
No, Jean-Pierre!

02:46:43.326 --> 02:46:45.624
Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre!

02:46:45.996 --> 02:46:49.432
No! Jean-Pierre!

02:46:50.867 --> 02:46:54.860
Jean-Pierre.
Jean-Pierre! Jean-Pierre.

02:46:58.108 --> 02:46:59.132
Jean-Pierre.

02:47:03.947 --> 02:47:06.211
Jean-Pierre!

02:47:06.483 --> 02:47:08.644
What do you want?
Is this what you want?

02:47:08.952 --> 02:47:13.582
Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?

02:47:47.891 --> 02:47:50.724
<i>The Commendatore <i>is showing</i>
<i>a black flag to his drivers.</i></i>

02:47:50.894 --> 02:47:53.328
<i>He's withdrawing the whole Ferrari team.</i>

02:47:53.496 --> 02:47:55.930
<i>I don't think it's been done like this</i>
<i>for about 40 years.</i>

02:47:56.099 --> 02:47:59.034
<i>The Alfa Romeo team manager</i>
<i>did the same thing once in the '20s...</i>

02:47:59.202 --> 02:48:02.603
<i>when Antonio Ascari was killed</i>
<i>in the French Grand Prix.</i>

02:48:02.772 --> 02:48:06.503
<i>He showed the black flag to Campari and</i>
<i>Brilli-Peri when the Alfas were in the lead.</i>

02:48:19.055 --> 02:48:23.287
<i>Here comes Barlini into the pits now</i>
<i>in response to the black-flag signal.</i>

02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:25.792
- Jean-Pierre?
<i>- He'll have to be told the terrible news...</i>

02:48:25.962 --> 02:48:27.361
<i>of his team leader's death.</i>

02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:31.765
<i>And this tragic race is over</i>
<i>for the young Sicilian.</i>

02:48:32.101 --> 02:48:33.625
<i>In the lead are Aron and Stoddard.</i>

02:48:33.703 --> 02:48:37.139
<i>They've just gone past the pits,</i>
<i>side by side, fighting for the lead.</i>

02:49:01.698 --> 02:49:03.632
<i>Last lap now.</i>
<i>Stoddard or Aron?</i>

02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:06.496
<i>They're still neck and neck,</i>
<i>wheel to wheel, the whole way.</i>

02:49:50.613 --> 02:49:52.513
<i>Stoddard's in front as they</i>
<i>come into the last corner.</i>

02:49:52.782 --> 02:49:54.613
<i>Aron, in the Yamura,</i>
<i>is right on his tail.</i>

02:49:54.784 --> 02:49:56.945
<i>He can still beat the BRM to the flag.</i>

02:50:17.841 --> 02:50:21.272
<i>It was Aron. The Yamura</i>
<i>was just a wheel in front of the BRM.</i>

02:50:21.544 --> 02:50:24.069
<i>Aron is the new world champion.</i>

02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:26.613
<i>It looked as if</i>
<i>the Yamura was just in front.</i>

02:50:26.783 --> 02:50:29.843
<i>Aron is the winner.</i>
<i>Aron is the new world champion.</i>

02:50:30.019 --> 02:50:34.786
<i>Pete Aron of the United States has won</i>
<i>the Italian Grand Prix for Yamura of Japan.</i>

02:50:34.958 --> 02:50:37.324
<i>And Scott Stoddard</i>
<i>in the BRM was second.</i>

02:50:37.493 --> 02:50:41.190
<i>What a race.</i>
<i>What a tremendous race.</i>

02:51:13.663 --> 02:51:14.857
Sarti?

02:52:02.946 --> 02:52:06.746
<i>Pete Aron is greeted as the winner</i>
<i>of the Italian Grand Prix...</i>

02:52:06.916 --> 02:52:10.181
<i>and this gives him</i>
<i>the World Drivers' Championship.</i>

02:52:10.353 --> 02:52:16.121
<i>A great triumph for this determined</i>
<i>American driver and for Izo Yamura of Japan...</i>

02:52:16.292 --> 02:52:20.558
<i>whose cars have challenged and</i>
<i>conquered the might of Europe Formula 1 teams...</i>

02:52:20.730 --> 02:52:24.029
<i>in spite of all the years of experience</i>
<i>and development behind them.</i>

02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:28.034
<i>But it's a sad end to this dramatic season</i>
<i>of battles for the championship.</i>

02:52:28.905 --> 02:52:33.103
<i>The tragic, fatal accident</i>
<i>to the great Jean-Pierre Sarti...</i>

02:52:33.276 --> 02:52:35.540
<i>has cast a shadow over the race.</i>

02:52:35.712 --> 02:52:39.341
<i>And everyone who knew him or</i>
<i>saw him drive will find it hard to accept...</i>

02:52:39.515 --> 02:52:43.747
<i>that his great skill</i>
<i>and tremendous personality is lost to us.</i>

02:52:44.087 --> 02:52:48.148
<i>I'm sure the last thing either Pete Aron</i>
<i>or Izo Yamura would have wished...</i>

02:52:48.791 --> 02:52:50.224
<i>is for it to end this way.</i>

02:52:58.801 --> 02:53:03.329
<i>Pete, do you ever get tired of the driving?</i>

02:53:03.506 --> 02:53:06.304
<i>Lately, I sometimes get very tired.</i>

02:53:06.476 --> 02:53:09.877
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
<i>Very tired.</i>
