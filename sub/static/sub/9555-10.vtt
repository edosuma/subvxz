Well, that does it for this set.
Thank you, folks.

Rich, how come Al's got us
playing in the afternoon?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.034
Oh, I don't know.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.666
He's, uh,
got some kind of meeting going

02:55.776 --> 02:57.175
with somebody there
in the kitchen.

02:57.277 --> 02:59.245
Must be somebody
he's trying to impress.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.178
Well, it can't be
the health inspector.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.874
The place is still open.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.712
Ah, don't you worry
about a thing, A.D.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.618
A.D.?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.349
Al Delvecchio.

03:10.457 --> 03:13.427
Oh. A.D. Right.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.462
With your personality
and our capital,

03:16.563 --> 03:18.725
this place should really
take off.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.733
Oh, I don't do too bad
right now, Mr. Holloway.

03:21.835 --> 03:25.032
Sometimes I go 50,
60 customers in one night,

03:25.138 --> 03:27.539
and some of them even order.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.009
You've got to think big, A.D.

03:31.111 --> 03:35.275
I mean, a chain of Arnold's
from coast to coast,

03:35.382 --> 03:38.079
your own penthouse,
your own yacht,

03:38.185 --> 03:40.483
your own limousine.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.146
Well, you better skip
the limousine

03:42.255 --> 03:44.952
'cause I get carsick
when I ride in the backseat.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.083
Hey, could I ride up in front
with the chauffeur?

03:47.194 --> 03:48.753
Sure, you got it, champ.

03:48.862 --> 03:49.829
Right.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.523
Hey, I want you
to meet the band.

03:51.631 --> 03:52.826
Come here, Mr. Holloway.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.423
- Mr. Holloway...
- Oh. How do you do?

03:54.534 --> 03:56.935
- Meet the, uh...
the, uh... the... -Hi.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.005
They don't have a name yet.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.767
Oh. Promote the place.

04:00.874 --> 04:05.869
Uh, let's call them
the Al Tones.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.209
The Al Tones!

04:09.416 --> 04:11.077
Or something else.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.146
Well, these are my booths.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.450
These are my customers,
happy customers.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.387
- That's my jukebox.
- Oh.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.858
And that's the girls' room.
We could skip that.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.759
This is the men's room.

04:23.797 --> 04:24.923
All right.
Come on, open up.

04:25.031 --> 04:26.260
Let me in.

04:26.366 --> 04:30.030
FONZIE: Not by a hair
on my chinny chin chin.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.271
Hey, Al.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.879
What's going on here, Al?
I'm on the phone.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.418
Overseas.
Rome, Al, Rome.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.714
.L.l u h?
-sorrv. sorm

04:46.820 --> 04:48.549
Hey, look, look, look,
let me ask you a question.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.781
- You know Italian, right?
- Oh, yeah.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.324
What's the word for, uh...

04:52.759 --> 04:54.523
Oh... I never learned
those words.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.426
I never got a chance
to use them.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.999
I'll use the
international language

04:59.099 --> 05:01.898
of heavy breathing.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.729
Oh, uh, we're
very continental here.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.898
Oh, I can see that.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.999
Well, listen, I've seen enough.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.841
I'll come back tonight
and close the deal, huh?

05:12.946 --> 05:16.211
Here's to a long
and prosperous partnership, A.D.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.841
Yeah, well,
I'm looking forward to it.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.352
Al, get a repairman.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.888
I just melted the wire.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.083
RALPH: Hey, Fonz, Fonz,
we're dying to hear

05:25.192 --> 05:26.682
about this
long-distance phone call.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.591
Yeah, how'd you make out
with the Roman beauty?

05:28.695 --> 05:31.357
Need you ask?

05:31.464 --> 05:32.488
Fonz, well, what is this?

05:32.599 --> 05:34.499
Yesterday Rio de Janeiro,
today Rome.

05:34.601 --> 05:35.762
What's going on?

05:35.869 --> 05:37.234
Well, I got this plan, see.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.170
L-I want to get my own page
in the Magilla Book of Records.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.365
That's right.

05:41.474 --> 05:45.240
"Fonzarelli: Around the World
in 80 Chicks."

05:47.047 --> 05:49.175
(Al laughing)

05:51.151 --> 05:52.516
Hey. Hey, Al? Al?

05:52.619 --> 05:54.246
You want something?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.823
Big biz. Big biz. Big biz.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.255
Big, big, big biz.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.487
Yeah, Al.
Uh, how'd your meeting go?

06:01.595 --> 06:03.290
Well, I don't want
to say it was good,

06:03.396 --> 06:05.160
and I don't want
to say it was bad,

06:05.265 --> 06:09.498
but you're now looking
at the next Howard Johnson.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.162
Hey, uh, Mr. Johnson,
you want to come

06:11.271 --> 06:12.898
out of the clouds here
and translate?

06:13.006 --> 06:15.031
Oh, yeah, Fonz.
You know the guy who just left?

06:15.141 --> 06:17.303
- Yeah. -Well, he's with
a very big investment company,

06:17.410 --> 06:19.674
and he wants to invest
in Arnold's.

06:19.779 --> 06:22.077
He says I got
a very big potential here.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.083
And he told me
to name my own price.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.414
RALPH:
Hey, Al.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.009
You'll need a commercial.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.520
- Good idea.
- Hi, there.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.557
Say, after a hard day
at the office,

06:31.658 --> 06:34.252
there is nothing
like an Arnold Burger.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.659
Ooh, I ate it!

06:37.931 --> 06:39.524
Al, it must have been
pretty exciting, huh?

06:39.633 --> 06:40.964
- I mean, the negotiations.
- Oh, yeah.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.037
Your lawyer on this side,
their lawyer on that side.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.263
Your accountant on this side,

06:45.372 --> 06:46.840
-their accountant on that side.
-(chuckling): No.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.237
- Your side of the table
- No, no...

06:48.341 --> 06:49.831
-versus their side of the table.
- Rich, Rich.

06:49.943 --> 06:50.876
- What?
- No.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.172
No accountants, no lawyers.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.179
- No?
- I mean, they're very expensive.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.249
But I know the guy
to go get advice from.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.908
- Oh, good.
-(phone ringing)

06:58.018 --> 07:00.544
Hey, now, I don't want you guys
to worry about a thing

07:00.654 --> 07:03.021
because I'm gonna take you all
to the top with me.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.249
RICHIE:
That's nice, Al.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.381
Hello.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.654
Yeah. Uh-huh.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.559
Fonz, it's for you.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.995
Go get her, Fonz.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.362
It's the overseas operator.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.960
Yo.

07:19.205 --> 07:20.263
What?

07:20.373 --> 07:21.568
All right, all right, all right.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.006
Calm down. Calm down.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.804
Here we go.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.505
(exhales softly)

07:31.051 --> 07:33.042
Marion?

07:35.588 --> 07:36.953
- MARION: What is it, Howard?
- Richie, Joanie,

07:37.057 --> 07:38.252
get down here quick.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.883
MARION: What is it, Howard?
I'm busy. What...

07:39.993 --> 07:42.052
- I bought something.
- JOANIE: Ooh!

07:42.162 --> 07:44.597
- MARION: What? -A color TV
with a remote control!

07:44.698 --> 07:46.097
No, it's not a color TV.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.166
It's outside.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.291
- Outside!
- Outside!

07:48.401 --> 07:50.369
- You traded in the DeSoto!
- A car?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.529
- Look. -JOANIE: A new car?
- RICHIE: Where is it?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.437
Wh-Wh-Where...?
It's stolen.

07:54.541 --> 07:55.975
Oh...

07:56.076 --> 07:58.067
No, Marion. Right here.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.237
It's a new item for the store.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.076
Look at this.

08:04.851 --> 08:06.216
Oh, that's terrific.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.753
Got to get back upstairs.

08:07.854 --> 08:10.346
Jenny's in the middle
of a juicy piece of gossip.

08:10.457 --> 08:13.552
Something about the
football coach wearing a dress.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.560
Coach Bilford?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.427
I got a date.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.590
Well, Howard,
I have to fix dinner.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.065
Well, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.829
A personalized doormat.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.996
I think it's gonna be
a big-selling item.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.006
Oh, but, Howard,
how many Cunninghams

08:28.108 --> 08:30.406
are there in Milwaukee?

08:31.978 --> 08:34.777
Marion, you can put
anything you want on it.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.178
Oh.

08:36.282 --> 08:37.613
How about "welcome"?

08:37.717 --> 08:38.912
(doorbell rings)

08:39.019 --> 08:40.350
Just answer the door, will you?

08:40.453 --> 08:41.614
Yeah, I got it.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.824
- Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
- Hey, Al.

08:48.561 --> 08:51.861
Something very important
came up, and I need your advice.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.763
Well, Al, as I told you
at Arnold's, I feel

08:53.867 --> 08:55.130
-that what you really need...
- Rich, Rich,

08:55.235 --> 08:56.566
- I was talking to your father.
- Oh.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.194
Of course, Al.
Come on in.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.567
What is it?

08:59.672 --> 09:02.471
Well, Howard, a man came
to see me from the, uh,

09:02.575 --> 09:04.566
Lake Michigan
Investment Company,

09:04.677 --> 09:06.111
and he wants to invest
in Arnold's,

09:06.212 --> 09:08.146
and he wants to expand it.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.773
Oh, isn't that
wonderful, Alfred?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.783
It sounds very exciting,
Al, but...

09:11.885 --> 09:13.979
well, maybe you shouldn't
rush into this.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.784
What do you know about
Lake Michigan Investments, huh?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.723
Well, nothing, but the guy's
a very nice person.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.191
Oh, sure, real nice.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.592
Wants to call our band
the Al Tones.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.926
Well, he may be nice,
but I still think

09:26.032 --> 09:27.431
you ought to check it out.

09:27.534 --> 09:28.968
To begin with, you ought to have

09:29.069 --> 09:31.094
your accountant
go over their books, and...

09:31.204 --> 09:33.468
and you'll need a lawyer
for the contracts.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.632
You hear that, Al?
Same advice I gave you.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.733
I have a nephew
who's almost a lawyer.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.836
He sent in this matchbook cover,
and six years later...

09:40.947 --> 09:42.346
Marion!

09:42.449 --> 09:43.939
He needs a lawyer now.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.449
Well, that's true.
Good luck, Al.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.986
Thank you, Marion.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.421
You know, Al, a franchise--
that's a lot of responsibility.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.184
You sure you want
to get into this?

09:52.292 --> 09:55.057
Well, Howard,
every man has his dream.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.630
And you know what my dream is?

09:57.730 --> 09:58.993
When I close my eyes,

09:59.099 --> 10:00.897
I see myself
walking along this road

10:01.000 --> 10:04.834
and I'm planting Arnold Burgers
as I go along.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.101
Just like... Johnny Appleseed.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.610
And sprouting up behind me
are thousands of drive-ins

10:11.711 --> 10:14.510
with people of every race,
color and creed

10:14.614 --> 10:17.242
coming up to me and saying,

10:17.350 --> 10:19.682
"Hold the onions, Al."

10:19.786 --> 10:22.721
Oh, that's a lovely dream.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.016
Well, I got to go.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.786
Wait a minute, Al.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.952
How would you like
one of these, uh,

10:29.062 --> 10:31.030
personalized doormats, huh?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.930
Oh, thanks, Howard.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.135
(chuckling)

10:40.240 --> 10:43.540
Two ice-cold glasses of milk.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.340
That's the way to start off
a business meeting.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.710
You got to keep a clear head.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.214
A.D.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.978
Oh, Mr. Holloway, come on in.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.110
Come in.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.086
Hey, have a nice glass of milk.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.088
No, no, thanks.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.089
I never touch it.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.420
You got anything stronger?

10:59.526 --> 11:01.790
Well, I could make you
a cherry fizz.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.329
That strong, huh?

11:03.429 --> 11:05.193
Well, maybe you
better forget it.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.096
Partners, huh, A.D.?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.168
Yeah, partners.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.430
Well, not yet.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.505
You see, before I make
a big decision like that,

11:12.605 --> 11:14.972
I think we ought to consult
with an accountant,

11:15.074 --> 11:16.303
-a lawyer.
- A lawyer?

11:16.409 --> 11:18.173
Yeah, because a partnership,

11:18.278 --> 11:20.542
there's a lot of things
to be considered.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.445
I totally agree with you.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.984
And here's something
you should consider right away.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.609
Boys!

11:32.392 --> 11:34.019
That's Leo...

11:34.127 --> 11:36.186
Oh, hi, Leo.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.522
And that's the Claw.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.058
Claw?

11:43.169 --> 11:44.830
You want lawyers, huh?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.838
Show 'em, Claw.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.115
The Claw.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.348
No lawyers.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.326
(sighs)

12:12.999 --> 12:15.331
Well, I guess this is it,
old girl.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.395
The end of the road.

12:19.505 --> 12:22.167
It was fate that brought us
to this moment.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.369
Fate.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.844
And a guy with an iron hand.

12:28.014 --> 12:31.507
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.451
Al. What is this?

12:35.555 --> 12:36.920
What the heck is this?

12:37.023 --> 12:38.718
What are these?
What the heck are these?

12:38.825 --> 12:40.953
Rich, I'm taking a little trip.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.755
A little trip, huh?

12:42.862 --> 12:44.660
"Closed, for sale by owner."

12:44.764 --> 12:45.822
That's no little trip.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.559
Okay, I'm taking a big trip.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.726
What is going on, Al?
Come on.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.998
- Rich, okay, it's good news!
- Yeah?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.800
I sold out to Mr. Holloway.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.067
Lots of bucks.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.233
Boy, I'm gonna make it
on easy street.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.572
Oh.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.306
Oh, Rich, I can't lie to you.
He's a crook.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.815
He's got a gang, and one
of them's got an iron hand.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.907
Oh, they-they want
to take over Arnold's,

13:06.019 --> 13:07.180
and-and they want
to make Arnold's

13:07.287 --> 13:08.550
-into a bookie joint.
- What?

13:08.655 --> 13:09.918
Well, I-l got to go, Rich.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.752
I'll write you a letter
explaining everything later.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.917
Hey, wait. Why don't you
explain it to me now?

13:14.027 --> 13:16.155
Try and tell me how running away
is gonna help anything.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.730
Rich, don't you see?

13:17.830 --> 13:19.958
Selling the building's the
only way I'm going to stop them.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.295
They're crooks.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.596
Hey, Al.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.170
All right, look.
Don't you sign nothing.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.328
They're crooks.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.668
- Fonz.
- Yeah.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.833
You knew without me telling you?

13:29.942 --> 13:32.741
That happens.
It happens sometimes.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.142
Let me tell you something.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.215
Nobody's gonna push one
of my friends out of town.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.751
You understand that?
You just stay right here.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.114
I'll be back.

13:40.219 --> 13:41.709
- Fonz, Fonz.
- Yeah.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.188
Mr. Holloway's gonna
come back in one hour.

13:44.290 --> 13:45.815
Hey, that's enough time.
Don't worry about it.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.188
Richie, let's get
the gang together.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.783
- Right now.
- Right.

13:48.895 --> 13:51.387
Get the gang together, Fonz.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.797
Fonz, we don't have a gang.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.767
We don't have a gang.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.705
<i>RICHIE: Fonzie and!
called this meeting</i>

14:02.809 --> 14:04.106
for one very big reason.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.338
These thugs are trying
to push around Al.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.777
We can't let that happen.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.370
Got any more soda, Rich?

14:09.482 --> 14:10.881
No, we don't have any more soda.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.542
Do you have any ideas?

14:12.652 --> 14:14.017
- I got it...
- Ah, good.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.485
- I got it.
- He's got it.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.319
We send them
a threatening Candygram.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.195
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that, Malph.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.194
Hear what, Fonz?

14:23.296 --> 14:25.458
I got it-- we'll burn 'em out.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.556
I definitely didn't hear that.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.635
(louder):
We'll burn them out.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.736
I think we're
overlooking something.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.206
I mean, why don't we just
call the police, huh?

14:35.308 --> 14:36.332
- That's a great idea, Rich.
- Yeah.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.705
What are you going to tell 'em?

14:37.810 --> 14:39.073
Three guys want to buy
into Al's?

14:39.178 --> 14:40.646
Well... well, yeah,
you're right.

14:40.747 --> 14:41.908
They haven't done anything.

14:42.014 --> 14:42.981
Okay, okay, no police.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.516
But we have got to do something.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.675
Hey, I'm doing it.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.753
I'm keeping my ear
to the street, huh?

14:47.854 --> 14:50.448
Bet you get kicked
in the head a lot.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.225
All right, now, here's the info.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.921
This gang was kicked out
of Chicago

14:57.029 --> 14:58.497
for messing with the real Mob.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.123
All right, then he tried to move

15:00.233 --> 15:01.792
into Cleveland,
you know, lay low.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.734
He was kicked out by the PTA.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.171
Well, yeah, that was then.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.105
Now he's got this new thug.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.835
Guy they call the Claw.

15:10.943 --> 15:11.910
Claw?

15:12.011 --> 15:13.172
Yeah, man has an iron hand.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.405
(Ralph whimpers)

15:15.715 --> 15:16.944
All right, now, look.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.813
I know exactly
what these thugs are.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.408
Bullies-- that's it.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.648
Fonz, you're going to pound
these guys, right?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.383
I never use violence
unless I have to.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.890
All right, Rich,
now, you tell me--

15:26.993 --> 15:28.825
what are we supposed to do
against these guys?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.987
Hey, I'm telling you,
I know exactly what to do.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.259
You stand up to a bully,
he backs down.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.460
You know, that's what
my dad always says.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.037
Only way to deal with a bully--
stand right up to him.

15:38.137 --> 15:39.605
My dad told me to run.

15:40.907 --> 15:43.842
My dad told me to stand there
and take it like a man.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.940
Well, I think Fonzie's
got the right idea here.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.174
I mean, if we can just make
a show of force,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.272
those guys will back down.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.351
Oh, yeah?
That's what Custer said.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.544
Hey, I promise you, Ralphie,

15:53.653 --> 15:55.382
nothing is going to
happen to you.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.458
Oh, this is great.
We'll back those creeps down.

15:58.558 --> 15:59.889
No way.

15:59.992 --> 16:01.892
You're too young
for this kind of stuff.

16:01.994 --> 16:04.395
Oh, I'm too young
for all the neat things.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.432
Oh, you know, actually I'm
a lot younger than I let on.

16:09.068 --> 16:13.301
Ralphie, I promised you nothing
is going to happen to you.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.532
Fine. It's all settled.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.005
We'll meet at Arnold's at 10:00.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.166
- Great. Oh.
- Oh!

16:17.276 --> 16:19.472
And you do not tell our parents.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.411
Oh, what do you think I am,
a squealer?

16:21.514 --> 16:22.481
No comment.

16:22.582 --> 16:23.572
All right, any questions?

16:23.683 --> 16:25.117
Should we eat first?

16:27.186 --> 16:28.881
Sit down. Come on, let's have...
let's have this out.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.683
- All right. -Okay, uh,
first thing we need to do

16:30.790 --> 16:32.189
-is talk to Al, right?
- That's right. -Right.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.350
And then, look, we tell Al
to move right in, okay?

16:34.460 --> 16:36.258
Here's what we're going to do.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.329
Ah, this is crazy.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.405
Fonzie's plan
is never gonna work.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.974
I'm getting out of here.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.471
You look like you're in a hurry.

16:55.581 --> 16:58.175
You're not trying to run out
on us, are you, partner?

16:58.284 --> 17:00.082
No, I was just gonna
go outside and check

17:00.186 --> 17:02.120
to make sure you got
a good parking space.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.313
Ain't that nice?

17:03.422 --> 17:05.083
- You're a good boy.
- Yeah.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.386
Hi, Leo.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.256
You're a real sweet boy.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.829
Hi, Mr. Holloway.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.491
Hi, Mr. Claw.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.536
Well, here are the papers,
right from the lawyer.

17:18.637 --> 17:22.131
Oh, I see, everything nice
and legal, huh?

17:22.241 --> 17:25.040
"Henceforth this joint is ours."

17:27.113 --> 17:29.013
You needed a lawyer for that?

17:29.115 --> 17:31.413
Sure, he put in
the "henceforth."

17:31.517 --> 17:34.077
AL: Well, guys, I don't want
to be a party pooper,

17:34.186 --> 17:36.848
but I can't sign that.

17:36.956 --> 17:40.290
Oh, I think our partner
needs a little persuading.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.792
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.328
No, wait, wait.
No, wait a minute, now.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.897
You know, I didn't
tell you this before,

17:44.997 --> 17:46.055
but I already have a partner,

17:46.165 --> 17:48.566
so I guess you boys
can just run along.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.296
Hey, how about some
nice burgers to go, okay?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.771
What is this, a double cross?

17:53.873 --> 17:55.432
Oh, no, no, no,
I wouldn't double-cross you.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.340
No, it's my partner, Mr. Big.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.071
Mr. Big.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.271
HOLLOWAY:
Mr. Big?

18:01.380 --> 18:02.779
What is it, a candy bar?

18:02.882 --> 18:04.748
No.
He's the leader of a gang.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.784
The meanest, toughest gang
in Milwaukee.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.376
And I'll tell you guys
something.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.649
He wouldn't like the idea
of you guys hanging around here.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.690
Oh, Mr. Big is tough, huh?

18:12.792 --> 18:15.261
Oh... tough, tough.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.954
HOLLOWAY:
Claw...

18:17.063 --> 18:19.191
show him tough.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.934
Ah, gee, I just filled that.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.337
Don't nobody move.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.073
Right, Scarf ace?

18:35.181 --> 18:37.240
Scarf ace?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.576
I surrender.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.586
Won't you put your hands down?

18:42.688 --> 18:44.383
Come on.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.322
Who are these punks?

18:46.425 --> 18:47.824
Oh, these guys aren't punks.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.725
They're part of Mr. Big's gang.

18:49.829 --> 18:50.990
You see that guy right there?

18:51.097 --> 18:52.895
That's Scarf ace Malph.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.933
He don't have no scar.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.559
Yeah, how about that?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.637
Oh, w-well, you see,
m-my skin's cleared up a lot.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.467
I cut out sweets.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.474
Yeah, and this guy--
the Undertaker.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.271
Yeah.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.910
Simple pine box, medium.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.178
I've had enough of this--
Claw.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.752
RALPH:
Claw!

19:13.853 --> 19:16.049
(nasal voice):
Freeze!

19:21.961 --> 19:24.191
I don't want no muscles moved.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.196
No muscles moved
until Mr. Big gets here,

19:26.298 --> 19:28.232
gets here, gets here, gets here.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.401
You're bluffing.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.941
There's no Mr. Big.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.033
No Mr. Big?

19:38.144 --> 19:40.408
(nasal cackling)

19:40.513 --> 19:43.813
Mr. Big.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.819
You lose, bullet brain.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.624
I'm Mr. Big.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.859
What kind of a name is Mr. Big?

20:00.966 --> 20:02.991
- Polish.
- German. -Russian.

20:04.270 --> 20:07.262
Hey, Al, what are these ants
doing in my place, huh?

20:07.373 --> 20:08.636
They want to take over Arnold's.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.266
They want to cut in
on your turf.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.037
Is that so?

20:12.144 --> 20:14.511
Psycho Louis,
tell them how I feel

20:14.613 --> 20:16.877
about that particular situation.

20:16.982 --> 20:19.076
(cackling)

20:19.185 --> 20:21.415
Mr. Big don't like
no uninvited guests

20:21.520 --> 20:23.511
in his joint,
in his joint, in his joint.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.249
So you guys better cut out
before we cut in.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.793
Before we cut in.
(cackles)

20:28.894 --> 20:30.919
See? You get it?

20:31.030 --> 20:33.089
Uh, I think they got it, Louis.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.428
RICHIE:
Cut, cut cut!

20:34.533 --> 20:35.898
Slice, slice, slice!

20:36.001 --> 20:38.231
I'm gonna make a jigsaw puzzle
out of the bunch of youse,

20:38.337 --> 20:39.736
the bunch of youse,
the bunch of youse.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.000
-(cackles)
- It's all right, Psycho.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.871
- Take it easy. Yeah.
- You can play later, Louie.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.966
I want to eat their watches.
(cackles)

20:45.077 --> 20:46.408
I want to eat your watches.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.480
He eats watches?

20:48.581 --> 20:51.380
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he starts at
the fingers and eats his way up.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.452
Yeah. Unless you're
wearing a pocket watch.

20:53.552 --> 20:56.487
Then... I don't even want
to talk about it.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.620
Now that you've met my family,

21:01.727 --> 21:04.458
why don't you get out of here
while you're still able?

21:04.563 --> 21:06.691
Yeah, there's a bus leaving
in five minutes.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.790
Be under it.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.936
I like it here, Mr. Small.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.833
Mr. Small?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.239
Oh, let me convince him.
I want to convince him.

21:18.344 --> 21:20.438
Cut, cut, slice, slice.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.106
Oh, that was good.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.206
Pass it on.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.150
(giggles) Pass it on.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.983
Pass it on.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.682
Pass it on.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.658
Ooh, ooh! No!
I didn't mean that!

21:34.760 --> 21:36.990
That was from them,
not-not from me.

21:37.096 --> 21:40.066
Didn't you guys ever play
that game, "Pass It On"?

21:40.166 --> 21:42.760
Nobody ever did that
to me before.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.565
These guys are tough.
Come on.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.401
POTSIE:
They're leaving.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.532
RALPH:
I don't think so. (yelps)

21:50.643 --> 21:52.372
HOLLOWAY:
Get 'em, boys.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.968
(yelling)

21:54.079 --> 21:55.376
POTSIE:
Look out! Look out!

21:55.481 --> 21:56.778
AL:
I got you, Claw!

21:56.882 --> 21:58.611
-(fingers snapping)
- FONZIE: Hold it.

21:58.717 --> 21:59.912
(others yelling)

22:00.019 --> 22:02.681
AL:
I got you! Take that!

22:02.788 --> 22:04.552
Take that!

22:05.958 --> 22:07.926
Oh.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.859
I'm sorry.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.158
Sit down. Get down.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.832
That's just
a little game we play

22:15.935 --> 22:17.425
before we get started,
all right?

22:17.536 --> 22:19.834
Now, it's just me and you,
Mr. "Hallway."

22:19.939 --> 22:21.236
No, it isn't.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.206
Claw does my dirty work.

22:23.309 --> 22:24.435
Is that so?

22:24.543 --> 22:27.240
Show him, Claw.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.188
Uh-oh.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.399
-(metallic creaking)
-(Claw groaning)

23:00.746 --> 23:03.147
Look what he did.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.614
He busted my claw.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.207
I got no claw.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.047
What are they gonna call me now?

23:08.153 --> 23:10.588
Lefty. Get out of the way.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.316
Your turn. Let's go.

23:12.424 --> 23:13.619
No, no, no, it's your turf.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.285
Come on, let's get out of here.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.589
There they are. There they are.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.459
- I told you-- right here.
- POTSIE: We did it.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.828
Wait, we're just trying...
we were going to buy the place.

23:20.933 --> 23:21.798
- Richard!
-ls everyone all right?

23:21.901 --> 23:23.391
- Oh, Richard.
- You all right?

23:23.502 --> 23:25.027
(nasal voice): I'm fine!
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine!

23:25.137 --> 23:26.229
I'm telling you, I'm fine!

23:26.338 --> 23:27.464
- I'll be okay!
- Oh!

23:27.573 --> 23:28.734
Oh, my-

23:28.841 --> 23:30.400
Somebody must have
hit him in the head.

23:30.509 --> 23:32.034
Nobody him me in the head.
No, no.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.543
We did the hitting
and the cutting

23:33.646 --> 23:34.977
and the slicing, and, boy...

23:35.080 --> 23:37.174
(normal voice):
We did real well.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.743
(indistinct chatter)

23:49.395 --> 23:50.624
MARION:
Oh, boys,

23:50.729 --> 23:52.254
these-these suits
and these hats.

23:52.364 --> 23:53.854
Well, it's just...
it's just a wonder

23:53.966 --> 23:55.434
that you didn't get hurt.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.299
Hey, Mrs. C., we had
everything under control.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.429
Oh, Mrs. C.,
I wish you could have seen me.

24:00.539 --> 24:02.974
I slapped that head guy
right in the face.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.134
Well, you still should have
gone to the police first.

24:05.244 --> 24:07.372
We couldn't.
They didn't break any laws.

24:07.479 --> 24:09.641
Yeah, but if you had gone,
you would have found out

24:09.748 --> 24:11.580
that they were wanted
in three other states.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.277
I slapped a tri-state hood?

24:14.453 --> 24:15.784
I must have been delirious.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.151
I still think it was wrong

24:17.256 --> 24:18.849
to take the law
in your own hands.

24:18.958 --> 24:19.891
Please, Howard.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.290
I mean, the boys did it for me.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.988
When I first took over Arnold's
and I met all you people

24:25.097 --> 24:27.122
for the first time,
I said to myself, I said,

24:27.232 --> 24:29.360
"Al, these are nice people.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.629
"These are good people.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.135
"These are honest people.

24:32.237 --> 24:33.329
"These are people who care.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.635
("Vinéfli
These are people who..."

24:38.577 --> 24:40.272
He's so sensitive.

24:40.379 --> 24:43.576
Well, I'm just glad
this is all over.

24:43.682 --> 24:45.377
And, Richard, I want you

24:45.484 --> 24:47.350
to take off
that horrible mustache.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.717
Ah, Mom, can't I keep
the mustache?

24:49.822 --> 24:52.382
I mean, I think it really
gives me a lot of...

24:52.491 --> 24:54.084
(nasal voice):
Pain.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.662
Oh, that gave me a lot of pain.
