WEBVTT

00:05.756 --> 00:08.508
There aren't any pictures
of me growing up.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.428
That seems impossible. I mean,
you weren't exactly camera-shy.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.805
Yeah, well, neither
were you and Piper.

00:14.014 --> 00:17.726
Or you and Grams or,
oh, you and Dad.

00:18.101 --> 00:21.354
Oh, look, here's another one
of you and Piper.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.774
Okay.

00:23.982 --> 00:28.111
- Here's a picture of you and Grams.
- Oh, wasn't I cute?

00:33.533 --> 00:35.744
Here's one of you and Mom.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.667
I don't even remember that.

00:43.251 --> 00:46.004
What was I, about 2 here?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.966
She died on us a year later.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.844
- Phoebe.
- Okay.

00:53.011 --> 00:56.431
Hurry, I need a pen and paper.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.642
Well, quick,
we don't have a lot of time.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.190
I always wondered how
you got in the candy drawer.

01:05.355 --> 01:07.442
Yeah, too bad all the candy's gone.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.695
I thought it would be easier for us
if we just write him a note.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.615
- Who him?
- You know, what's-his-name.

01:17.702 --> 01:20.121
Grandma's little friend,
comes every year.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.748
Same day, same time.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.500
Says, you know, the flowers
are from a secret admirer,

01:24.667 --> 01:27.629
when it's obvious he's the admirer.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.174
Hi, come on in.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.009
Hi.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.931
- How are you?
- Flowers for Miss Penny Halliwell.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.436
Every year. What a klutz.

01:43.644 --> 01:47.023
At least this year I can freeze him
so I can spare myself the cleanup.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.400
Why did you wanna
write him a note?

01:50.109 --> 01:54.280
- To tell him Grams is dead.
- Oh, you're gonna break his heart.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.079
Five chimes.

02:02.955 --> 02:05.624
- Excuse me?
- The clock.

02:05.833 --> 02:08.127
I only heard five chimes.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.753
It's noon.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.589
That means you froze me.

02:13.257 --> 02:15.259
Which means you have
your powers at last.

02:15.801 --> 02:19.054
I don't know what you're talking about,
but thanks for the flowers. Okay, bye.

02:19.263 --> 02:21.390
Call me Nicholas.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.476
Your mother did.

02:23.684 --> 02:24.977
Oh, dear.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.068
I had to appear to age
over the years,

02:33.235 --> 02:34.904
otherwise you would've
been suspicious.

02:35.112 --> 02:36.822
What?

02:37.489 --> 02:39.533
You see, 24 years ago today,

02:39.700 --> 02:41.368
your mother and I, we made a pact.

02:41.910 --> 02:46.999
To spare her life, she gave up
your future powers to me.

02:47.958 --> 02:50.627
She blessed this ring,

02:50.794 --> 02:53.630
which gave me immunity
from your powers.

02:54.214 --> 02:56.967
Immunity so that I could kill you

02:57.134 --> 03:00.179
and take the powers
on for my own...

03:00.804 --> 03:02.598
...to become invincible.

03:02.806 --> 03:05.726
Our mother would never
give away our powers.

03:05.934 --> 03:08.145
She didn't have much of a choice.

03:09.646 --> 03:11.857
Your blood is boiling.

03:13.317 --> 03:16.153
Soon your lungs will sear.

03:16.737 --> 03:21.325
Your organs will overheat,
and death will come.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:33.879 --> 03:35.338
Why would Mom
make a deal like that?

03:35.505 --> 03:38.008
More importantly,
what are we gonna do?

03:38.633 --> 03:40.969
Wait, I think I found a spell
to unbind a bond.

03:41.887 --> 03:43.430
You can't run from me!

03:43.638 --> 03:46.016
- Okay, we have no choice.
- Okay, Phoebe, hurry.

03:46.224 --> 03:50.604
<i>The bond which was not to be done
Give us the power to see it undone</i>

03:50.812 --> 03:53.106
<i>And turn back time
to whence it was begun</i>

04:03.742 --> 04:06.411
- It didn't work?
- Nothing happened.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.380
Whose phone is that?

04:18.548 --> 04:20.466
Not ours.

04:21.426 --> 04:22.760
- Halliwell residence.
- You go.

04:23.386 --> 04:25.638
- You go.
- She goes.

04:27.724 --> 04:30.768
I beg your pardon?
Well, Donna, I'm just hurt

04:30.935 --> 04:34.147
that you would suspect
my little angels of such a thing.

04:36.149 --> 04:38.943
- Grams?
- Prue.

04:39.110 --> 04:40.319
Just a moment, Donna.

04:40.486 --> 04:44.532
Prue, Piper. Girls,
don't run in the house.

04:45.158 --> 04:47.410
Yes, yes.

04:52.957 --> 04:54.959
- What did you see?
- The warlock?

04:56.294 --> 04:58.087
No...

04:58.254 --> 05:00.423
...us.

06:41.857 --> 06:43.400
How do we know
we're back in time?

06:43.567 --> 06:48.113
What if we just brought the past to us
accidentally? We've done it before.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.574
Piper, look around.
What do you see?

06:50.782 --> 06:54.536
- A messy attic, like always.
- No, not just like always.

06:54.703 --> 06:56.288
You have a black light,

06:56.454 --> 06:58.623
a typewriter,

06:58.832 --> 07:02.669
eight-track tapes and a pet rock.

07:02.877 --> 07:05.839
I mean, we got rid of this stuff
years ago, remember?

07:06.006 --> 07:08.800
- And you saw us as kids?
- Yeah.

07:09.551 --> 07:11.010
Oh, this can't be happening.

07:11.219 --> 07:12.846
- I'm getting a migraine.
- Better not.

07:13.012 --> 07:15.557
I don't think Advil's
been invented yet.

07:15.723 --> 07:19.060
And apparently, neither has this spell.
It's not in here anywhere.

07:19.269 --> 07:22.522
But we just cast it.
That's how we got back here.

07:22.689 --> 07:26.025
Yeah, well, wherever here is,
it's before the spell was written.

07:26.192 --> 07:28.903
So there's nothing in there about
how to get back to our own time?

07:29.112 --> 07:31.072
Nothing.

07:31.781 --> 07:34.242
Let me be the first to say
that we're screwed.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.619
No, because at least we're alive.

07:36.786 --> 07:39.539
I mean, if we'd stayed in our time,
Nicholas would've killed us.

07:39.706 --> 07:41.958
We barely got away as it was.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.127
Is. Will be.

07:44.293 --> 07:46.003
You know, I've never
been good with tenses.

07:46.421 --> 07:50.258
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, Grams is right downstairs.

07:50.425 --> 07:53.052
Maybe we should just go
and tell her who we are.

07:53.928 --> 07:55.138
And say what?

07:55.304 --> 07:57.431
Hi, we're the ghosts
of grandchildren future?

07:57.598 --> 07:59.976
Come on, even Grams
is gonna have trouble with that.

08:00.143 --> 08:03.104
Plus, she has that heart condition.

08:03.604 --> 08:05.189
Okay, fine, so we need another plan.

08:05.356 --> 08:08.442
But first, we just need
to get out of the house.

08:10.736 --> 08:13.614
You're talking too fast, I can't...

08:14.115 --> 08:16.909
Patty, sweetheart, slow down.

08:17.076 --> 08:19.412
- Patty?
- Mom.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.957
What premonition? That's impossible.
You don't have premonitions.

08:23.165 --> 08:25.543
Wait, I thought you said
Mom's power was to freeze time.

08:25.710 --> 08:29.046
It is. Was.
You know what I mean.

08:29.422 --> 08:31.173
Maybe you should go see a doctor.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.509
<i>I don't need to go
to the doctor, Mom.</i>

08:33.676 --> 08:35.177
Piper.

08:37.847 --> 08:40.140
She's talking to Mom.

08:40.307 --> 08:42.726
<i>I can't explain it either, Mom.
It just happened.</i>

08:42.893 --> 08:45.437
<i>I felt a twinge in my stomach
and then, bam, I saw it.</i>

08:45.646 --> 08:47.690
<i>- Saw what?
- Three women, warlocks.</i>

08:47.856 --> 08:49.566
<i>And one of them was taking Prue.</i>

08:49.775 --> 08:51.360
Do you think that's
really Mom's voice?

08:51.527 --> 08:54.071
- Yes.
- Are you still nauseous?

08:54.279 --> 08:55.739
Why don't you come home?

08:55.948 --> 08:58.575
<i>I can't, and it was not a daydream.</i>

08:58.742 --> 09:01.370
Three warlocks? She can't be
talking about us, can she?

09:01.578 --> 09:03.372
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

09:04.623 --> 09:07.042
Okay, let's just get out of here.

09:17.469 --> 09:21.056
Prudence, Piper.

09:27.813 --> 09:29.648
No fair, using magic.

09:32.943 --> 09:35.237
Wait, we had powers back then?

09:35.404 --> 09:37.572
Oh, this is freaky.

09:45.122 --> 09:47.332
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:53.922 --> 09:55.840
You got one too.

09:57.050 --> 09:58.802
Come here.

09:59.219 --> 10:01.638
How many times
have I told you girls...?

10:04.891 --> 10:07.394
Grams, we can explain.

10:07.602 --> 10:09.187
Warlocks, begone.

10:14.693 --> 10:15.777
Oh, God, let's go.

10:15.985 --> 10:18.488
Grams definitely
had her power down.

10:18.655 --> 10:21.157
She is one scary witch.

10:21.324 --> 10:24.410
I don't remember having
powers at that age, do you?

10:24.577 --> 10:28.373
No, I thought that we got them
for the first time last year.

10:29.457 --> 10:31.709
Apparently not.
We must have lost them

10:31.876 --> 10:34.921
before we could even
remember having them.

10:35.964 --> 10:39.467
Yeah, how weird was that,
seeing us as kids? Totally bizarre.

10:39.676 --> 10:41.678
Mom is barely pregnant with me.

10:43.221 --> 10:45.723
March 24th, 1975.

10:45.932 --> 10:48.226
That's the day that Mom
made the pact with Nicholas.

10:48.434 --> 10:51.771
So maybe that's why the spell
sent us back here, to stop the pact.

10:51.979 --> 10:54.857
Which means it could be the only
way for us to get back to our time.

10:55.066 --> 10:57.652
We've gotta go see Mom
and warn her about Nicholas.

10:57.819 --> 11:00.822
Yeah, but we have to do a better job
of convincing Mom than we did Grams.

11:00.988 --> 11:02.490
This time we have to
use our powers.

11:02.657 --> 11:05.201
The problem is she's on
the lookout for three warlocks now.

11:05.701 --> 11:11.123
So then maybe only two of us
should approach her, just in case.

11:11.332 --> 11:13.626
Well, since I don't
have any powers to show Mom,

11:13.793 --> 11:15.002
I think it should be you two.

11:15.503 --> 11:18.673
And I'll just stand outside
and watch for Nicholas.

11:18.881 --> 11:22.259
That doesn't seem fair to you,
Phoebe, not being able to see Mom.

11:22.969 --> 11:26.472
I know, it's not. But I got
over that a long time ago.

11:26.639 --> 11:28.933
I don't need to see her now.

11:32.019 --> 11:33.813
Really, it's okay.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.818
We better get going, though,
before we miss her.

11:56.418 --> 11:58.128
Scary.

11:58.295 --> 12:01.131
Buddy's has not changed a bit.

12:01.298 --> 12:02.716
Wouldn't?

12:02.883 --> 12:04.677
Didn't?

12:05.552 --> 12:07.096
Give it up, I know what you mean.

12:07.471 --> 12:09.598
I don't see Mom anywhere, do you?

12:09.807 --> 12:11.642
No.

12:12.726 --> 12:14.728
Prue.

12:18.315 --> 12:20.609
Mom.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.503
She's so beautiful.

12:40.671 --> 12:42.798
Yeah, she is.

12:49.387 --> 12:51.890
I don't remember her working here.

12:52.057 --> 12:55.393
Well, yeah. I mean, with Dad gone,
she had to pay the bills somehow.

12:55.560 --> 12:59.189
I remember she used
to come home late at night

12:59.356 --> 13:02.192
and she would kiss me and she
always smelled like burgers.

13:05.570 --> 13:08.031
You're lucky, you have
a lot more memories than I do.

13:09.074 --> 13:11.534
Well, at least you have some.

13:11.701 --> 13:14.162
I mean, poor Phoebe,
she doesn't have any.

13:21.336 --> 13:23.046
Here she comes.

13:23.922 --> 13:26.049
What do we do
if she recognizes us?

13:26.216 --> 13:30.887
You freeze the place, and when
she sees that we don't freeze either,

13:31.054 --> 13:33.598
then she'll believe us
when we tell her who we are.

13:34.057 --> 13:37.435
- Okay. How do I look?
- Great.

13:37.894 --> 13:39.187
Ready to order?

13:46.819 --> 13:48.488
Take your time, I'll come back.

13:48.947 --> 13:51.741
No, wait! We're ready,
aren't we, Prue?

13:51.908 --> 13:53.576
Prunes.

13:55.745 --> 14:00.249
Prunes. She wants to know
if you have any prunes.

14:00.666 --> 14:02.752
Prunes? Sure.

14:02.919 --> 14:05.296
Yeah, I think so.
I just started here.

14:05.463 --> 14:07.757
- I'll go check.
- No.

14:08.216 --> 14:10.426
She can order something else.

14:12.762 --> 14:16.224
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

14:17.016 --> 14:18.517
Yeah, so do you.

14:20.603 --> 14:22.688
Now.

14:28.944 --> 14:31.280
- What's the matter?
- It's not working.

14:31.447 --> 14:32.865
You try.

14:37.286 --> 14:38.746
Okay, how is that possible?

14:39.246 --> 14:42.583
- Patty, phone.
- Okay, thanks.

14:43.042 --> 14:46.045
I'll be back.

14:47.338 --> 14:50.424
Wait. We know you're pregnant.

14:53.510 --> 14:55.012
What?

14:56.096 --> 14:59.850
This is gonna sound really weird,
but we're actually your...

15:00.017 --> 15:01.769
Cousins...

15:01.977 --> 15:05.064
...from out of town.
- Right, cousins.

15:05.230 --> 15:08.442
And we... We need to tell you
something really important

15:08.609 --> 15:12.363
about the baby
that you're carrying, sort of.

15:13.822 --> 15:17.493
Not that this is any of your business,
but I can't get pregnant anymore.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.871
Medically impossible.

15:21.747 --> 15:24.124
Excuse me.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.377
I panicked.
I thought, you know,

15:27.544 --> 15:30.047
close family would know
that she's pregnant.

15:30.214 --> 15:31.882
Yeah, well,

15:32.424 --> 15:34.551
not only does she not know
that she's pregnant,

15:34.718 --> 15:37.012
but she doesn't even think
that she can get pregnant.

15:37.220 --> 15:38.347
But we got bigger problems.

15:38.513 --> 15:41.600
We have no powers, which means
we have no way of stopping Nicholas.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.143
Yeah, how do we not have powers?

15:43.310 --> 15:45.937
I mean, little Prue and little Piper,
they have powers.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.482
I don't know,
maybe only one set of us

15:48.648 --> 15:51.985
can have powers at the same time,
in the same time.

15:52.694 --> 15:54.446
Thank you, Mr Spock.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.158
I was working, that's why
I couldn't take your call.

15:58.366 --> 16:01.369
<i>The premonition you had, did you see
what the warlocks look like?</i>

16:01.536 --> 16:03.955
The warlocks?
No, I didn't see their faces. Why?

16:04.164 --> 16:07.876
I'll tell you why: Because I saw them.
All three of them, here.

16:08.084 --> 16:09.836
<i>And one of them
had a hold of Prudence.</i>

16:10.003 --> 16:12.005
<i>- Are the girls okay?
- For now, thanks to me.</i>

16:12.172 --> 16:14.299
I'm coming right home.

16:32.066 --> 16:36.112
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no. It's totally my fault.

16:36.321 --> 16:38.156
So silly.

16:42.285 --> 16:43.953
I'm such a klutz sometimes.

16:44.579 --> 16:46.706
Really?

16:47.207 --> 16:49.751
- So am I.
- Yeah?

16:50.293 --> 16:52.420
Yeah.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.884
- Crackers?
- Upset stomach.

17:00.094 --> 17:03.097
You know, you shouldn't
be smoking these now.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.893
It's bad for your upset stomach.

17:07.518 --> 17:08.810
You're very sweet.

17:10.855 --> 17:13.398
Thanks. I gotta go.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.484
- So soon?
- Excuse me?

17:15.693 --> 17:19.238
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, thanks, officer.

17:19.864 --> 17:22.241
Oh, my God. Nicholas.

17:22.450 --> 17:26.494
I'm late. Thanks again. Goodbye.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.293
Excuse me,

17:32.460 --> 17:35.254
- how do you get to Berkeley?
- Get out of my way.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.479
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Nicholas is here.

17:51.645 --> 17:53.022
What? Where?

17:53.189 --> 17:54.773
Run.

18:13.292 --> 18:16.879
- Was Nicholas wearing his ring?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

18:17.046 --> 18:18.547
Good thing you were there, Pheebs.

18:18.714 --> 18:21.300
That was probably when Nicholas
was gonna make his move on Mom.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.303
No, I don't think so. Otherwise,
we'd be back in our own time by now.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.556
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

18:27.931 --> 18:31.560
It's just, seeing Mom
for the first time and talking to her,

18:31.727 --> 18:33.937
I just didn't expect to feel so...

18:34.104 --> 18:36.106
Feel what? Good?

18:36.273 --> 18:37.983
No.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.193
Overwhelmed.

18:41.361 --> 18:43.739
Well, Mom's car is here.
At least we know where she is.

18:43.947 --> 18:47.200
Question is, how do we get to her?
Grams must've told her about us.

18:47.409 --> 18:49.536
She probably thinks
that we're the warlocks.

18:49.703 --> 18:52.581
Our only option is to wait
for Nicholas to show.

18:52.748 --> 18:55.000
But what are we gonna do
without our powers?

18:55.625 --> 18:57.961
Well, technically
you still have your powers.

18:59.129 --> 19:01.089
If you count
little Prue and little Piper.

19:03.884 --> 19:06.511
We need powers,
and they have them.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.221
Come on.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.894
Coast is clear.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.604
What if Grams catches us?

19:15.770 --> 19:17.856
She'll kill us before Nicholas
has the chance.

19:18.023 --> 19:21.109
She won't catch us. Observe.

19:21.318 --> 19:25.322
You said yourself the girls are safe
with you. Besides, I want to go.

19:25.530 --> 19:30.076
You are making a big mistake, Patty.
Victor is not coming back.

19:30.285 --> 19:32.287
- How did you...?
- Heating duct to upstairs.

19:32.495 --> 19:34.080
I used to listen
to you guys for hours.

19:34.289 --> 19:38.126
Especially when you used to sneak
Andy to your bedroom in high school.

19:38.585 --> 19:41.087
Okay, you stay here
and keep tabs on them.

19:41.254 --> 19:43.798
We're gonna try
and go find the little girls.

19:47.051 --> 19:49.512
- That's my doll.
- You gave it to me.

19:49.721 --> 19:52.348
- No, I didn't, you stole it.
- It's true, you did steal it.

19:52.515 --> 19:54.642
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

19:56.102 --> 19:58.271
Hey, that's not fair.

20:00.273 --> 20:02.233
You came back.

20:05.570 --> 20:08.698
Yes, we did. And we're
gonna keep it a secret, right?

20:09.240 --> 20:11.159
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:11.367 --> 20:15.288
- You're pretty.
- Oh, so are you.

20:15.496 --> 20:17.665
Give me a break.

20:18.249 --> 20:20.209
Grams said you're bad people.

20:20.668 --> 20:22.128
No, no, no. We're good people.

20:22.295 --> 20:25.006
We're just like you.

20:25.631 --> 20:27.592
Yeah, we're family.

20:29.969 --> 20:33.347
Victor sent me a note, asked me
to stop by his hotel after my shift.

20:33.514 --> 20:36.309
- Dad?
- It was doomed from the start.

20:36.517 --> 20:38.936
You never even took his last name.

20:39.103 --> 20:42.732
- You wouldn't let me.
- Well, that's beside the point.

20:42.898 --> 20:44.859
Why can't you just
wear your uniform to see him?

20:45.067 --> 20:47.486
Because I don't want him
to know I'm a waitress.

20:48.279 --> 20:52.241
Look, it can't hurt to talk, right?

20:52.408 --> 20:54.493
Well, let him go, I say.

20:54.702 --> 20:56.495
If husbands were
supposed to stay married,

20:56.662 --> 20:59.165
God would've made them live longer.

20:59.331 --> 21:02.376
- Mother.
- What?

21:02.543 --> 21:04.003
Grams.

21:04.211 --> 21:07.172
We're not supposed
to go places with strangers.

21:07.715 --> 21:10.467
Yes, but we're not strangers, Prue.

21:10.676 --> 21:13.137
You're safe with us. And I know
that you know in your heart

21:13.304 --> 21:17.224
- that you can trust us.
- If you're really family, prove it.

21:17.725 --> 21:19.977
Prove it? How the hell
are we supposed to do that?

21:20.144 --> 21:21.311
Piper.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.646
Piper?

21:22.813 --> 21:24.940
Your name's Piper too?

21:26.275 --> 21:27.901
Yeah.

21:28.110 --> 21:31.071
And not only do we have
the same name,

21:31.238 --> 21:36.451
but we have the same secrets.

21:37.202 --> 21:39.288
Okay, follow me. Come on.

21:41.081 --> 21:43.917
- Freeze!
- No, wait...

21:44.084 --> 21:47.671
I'm telling Mom. You're not
supposed to freeze people.

21:47.838 --> 21:49.172
But he said to.

21:50.465 --> 21:52.759
Prue, Piper, Mom's coming down.

21:54.803 --> 21:57.597
Fine, if you must go, go.
I can't stop you.

21:57.764 --> 22:00.017
I also can't promise I won't
teach the girls a new spell

22:00.183 --> 22:01.977
while you're gone.

22:02.144 --> 22:06.356
Can't you just bake cookies with them,
like all the other grandmothers?

22:06.523 --> 22:11.403
The recipes they learn from me
don't come from Betty Crocker, dear.

22:11.987 --> 22:13.613
Bye, girls. Love you.

22:16.950 --> 22:21.454
- Where did you come from?
- Yeah, that's a good question.

22:21.663 --> 22:23.540
Don't ask. Okay, we gotta go fast.

22:23.707 --> 22:26.209
- Mom just left and Grams is...
- Prudence? Piper?

22:26.418 --> 22:28.461
Coming.

22:32.507 --> 22:35.343
- I wanna go too.
- No, Andy, you have to stay here.

22:35.552 --> 22:37.512
- No!
- Okay, we got it, we got it.

22:37.679 --> 22:40.807
- Little Andy Trudeau is so cute.
- All right, ready?

22:41.975 --> 22:44.185
Freeze him.

22:44.894 --> 22:47.605
Okay, cool. Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

22:47.772 --> 22:51.317
Okay, maybe that's why
Andy's so suspicious of us.

22:51.484 --> 22:56.656
Okay, Grams keeps the keys
in the same spot? Yes, good.

23:00.285 --> 23:05.206
Oh, Andy, did Piper
freeze you again?

23:05.415 --> 23:09.210
You poor dear.
You won't remember a thing.

23:09.836 --> 23:14.173
- Do you know where the girls went?
- I think the strange ladies took them.

23:30.147 --> 23:33.943
Okay, girls. When we see
a bad guy, what do we do?

23:34.110 --> 23:38.489
- She's gonna cry.
- Am not. I'm gonna freeze him.

23:38.698 --> 23:42.994
And then I'm going to move him.

23:43.619 --> 23:46.163
Okay, then we'll take care
of him and then we will all...

23:46.372 --> 23:48.541
- Run like the wind.
- Run like the wind.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.668
Exactly. All right,
let's give it a try. Ready?

23:50.876 --> 23:52.044
Yes.

23:57.633 --> 23:59.510
Can we do it again?

23:59.677 --> 24:03.013
Yes, yes.
Practice makes perfect. Okay.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.932
Go try it.

24:06.684 --> 24:08.978
These girls have major juice.

24:09.603 --> 24:11.939
They have control, they can aim.

24:12.147 --> 24:15.526
Yeah, well, they've had their powers
a lot longer than we have.

24:15.693 --> 24:17.736
I mean, did. I think.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.657
What do you think happened
to our powers when we were kids?

24:21.865 --> 24:24.118
Well, we lost a lot growing up.

24:24.284 --> 24:26.704
Somehow, we must have
lost them too.

24:27.371 --> 24:29.707
Okay, I finally found a payphone.

24:29.873 --> 24:32.751
Mom is at work until 5
and Nicholas is on duty till 6.

24:33.127 --> 24:36.046
Good, at least we know where he is.
The girls are ready.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.631
Well, I'm not.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.842
Why not?

24:40.050 --> 24:44.429
Mom died before I could grab onto
enough to keep her alive in my head.

24:45.514 --> 24:50.644
And now she's here alive,
pregnant with me.

24:51.687 --> 24:55.315
If we stop Nicholas, we have
to go back to our own time.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.443
And there's no Mom there.

24:58.652 --> 25:00.487
Well, we don't
have a choice, Phoebe.

25:07.244 --> 25:09.746
Ladies, is this your car?

25:24.636 --> 25:26.846
Come in.

25:28.181 --> 25:30.141
Victor?

25:33.770 --> 25:35.605
Get off me!

25:37.357 --> 25:41.569
Wouldn't have you freezing me, Patty.
That would ruin everything.

25:43.655 --> 25:46.032
- You.
- Call me Nicholas.

25:46.199 --> 25:48.493
- Where's Victor?
- Not here.

25:48.660 --> 25:51.329
Bait for the hook.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.252
Your blood is boiling.

25:57.418 --> 26:00.171
And then, death will come.

26:05.176 --> 26:06.803
What do you want?

26:07.011 --> 26:10.974
What does any warlock want?
I want your power, Patty.

26:11.182 --> 26:12.934
At least, that's what I wanted at first.

26:13.393 --> 26:17.397
Until I realized you're
the mother of the Charmed Ones.

26:17.605 --> 26:20.400
No. No, you're mistaken.

26:20.566 --> 26:24.362
- I only have two children.
- Oh, but there will be a third child.

26:24.529 --> 26:27.031
Where did that premonition
of yours come from, Patty,

26:27.198 --> 26:31.119
if not from the unborn
child inside you?

26:31.285 --> 26:32.995
I tapped your phone.

26:33.746 --> 26:37.583
I heard you and the old witch
talking about it.

26:38.543 --> 26:41.295
I saw three warlocks. Women.

26:41.504 --> 26:44.257
I saw them too, at the diner.

26:45.174 --> 26:47.551
Rivals, perhaps.

26:52.139 --> 26:55.017
I got to you first.

27:11.492 --> 27:13.369
Oh, please.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.080
I beg you.

27:16.872 --> 27:18.457
Don't hurt them.

27:19.541 --> 27:22.628
There is another option, Patty.

27:27.091 --> 27:30.094
I can't believe we got arrested
for kidnapping ourselves.

27:30.260 --> 27:33.555
Yeah, well, it should make
for a pretty interesting defence.

27:33.764 --> 27:34.807
You think this is funny?

27:34.973 --> 27:37.434
Prue, we're not just stuck in jail,
we're stuck in the past.

27:37.643 --> 27:39.853
Yes, I know, Piper,
I've been following.

27:41.730 --> 27:44.024
- Bright side?
- I dare you.

27:44.233 --> 27:46.944
Well, maybe we can
get to know Mom better.

27:47.152 --> 27:49.696
Or in my case, finally.

27:49.863 --> 27:51.406
I mean, if we really are stuck here,

27:51.573 --> 27:54.201
we might as well
take advantage of it, right?

27:54.409 --> 27:57.412
Maybe we can even keep her
from dying young this time.

27:59.915 --> 28:00.999
Five minutes, ma'am.

28:05.963 --> 28:08.632
How did you know I was pregnant?

28:10.217 --> 28:11.760
Who are you people?

28:13.095 --> 28:14.846
Your daughters.

28:25.398 --> 28:29.069
Okay, I bailed you out.
You just better not be warlocks.

28:29.277 --> 28:32.906
Well, we wouldn't have needed
you to bail us out if we were.

28:33.949 --> 28:38.995
I've seen some magic in my life,
but this is a miracle.

28:39.162 --> 28:41.331
More than you know, Mom.

28:41.498 --> 28:43.792
Where are the little ones?

28:43.958 --> 28:45.210
Home with Grams.

28:45.377 --> 28:48.254
I called her before I came. That's how
I found out you'd been arrested.

28:48.671 --> 28:50.131
Did you tell her about us?

28:50.298 --> 28:53.676
No. I didn't know what to say.

28:54.219 --> 28:55.929
I didn't know who you were myself.

29:01.142 --> 29:03.228
You're all so beautiful.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.815
More than I ever would've imagined.

29:08.650 --> 29:10.735
Phoebe.

29:15.657 --> 29:17.909
Phoebe.

29:18.868 --> 29:21.329
Talk about miracles.

29:22.580 --> 29:25.291
I must've named you
after my favourite aunt.

29:25.458 --> 29:28.127
But if you don't like the name,
I can always change it.

29:28.294 --> 29:29.837
No, I love it.

29:34.675 --> 29:35.802
Mom,

29:35.968 --> 29:39.138
we cast a spell to come
back in time to help you.

29:39.305 --> 29:41.974
- To stop you.
- To stop me from what?

29:42.391 --> 29:45.561
From making a pact
with a warlock named Nicholas.

29:46.187 --> 29:48.189
Then you're too late.

29:48.397 --> 29:49.857
What?

29:50.608 --> 29:54.570
I thought I was going
to see Victor, your father.

29:54.737 --> 29:56.447
But it turned out to be a trap.

29:56.656 --> 29:58.407
Nicholas.

29:58.574 --> 30:00.785
He tried to kill me.

30:00.993 --> 30:02.787
Phoebe too.

30:02.995 --> 30:07.249
I had to give him immunity to your
powers in exchange for your lives.

30:10.044 --> 30:13.506
I'd rather love you
as mortal daughters...

30:14.340 --> 30:16.967
...than have to mourn you
as dead witches.

30:17.134 --> 30:19.386
But he's gonna kill us
anyway to get our powers.

30:19.720 --> 30:24.683
No, not until Phoebe's born
and all your powers are complete.

30:24.892 --> 30:28.604
I bought us some time in the hopes
that Grams could help us.

30:30.064 --> 30:33.525
Oh, she's going to be
so thrilled when she sees you.

30:34.276 --> 30:36.695
The Charmed Ones.

30:52.586 --> 30:54.379
- Where was I born?
- Mom.

30:54.546 --> 30:57.424
I'm still not convinced
that they're not warlocks.

30:57.633 --> 31:00.260
We have a pact to undo.
We should be looking for a spell.

31:00.469 --> 31:01.887
Boston.

31:03.430 --> 31:05.098
In a hotel room, breech.

31:06.350 --> 31:08.018
What was my husband's name?

31:08.727 --> 31:10.437
Which husband?

31:11.480 --> 31:14.524
- Who's Melinda Warren?
- The beginning of our family line.

31:14.691 --> 31:16.902
She gave us our powers,
our destiny.

31:17.110 --> 31:20.113
What's the secret ingredient
in my blueberry cobbler?

31:20.280 --> 31:21.782
Honey and a splash of rum.

31:22.282 --> 31:24.576
What's IBM selling at in your time?

31:25.076 --> 31:27.287
- Mom.
- What?

31:27.496 --> 31:30.832
- This is not the time for personal gain.
- You're right.

31:31.625 --> 31:34.127
If they could just nod their heads.

31:34.336 --> 31:36.421
Okay, forget it.

31:36.671 --> 31:40.759
Well, look at you.
The three of you.

31:41.635 --> 31:46.973
Oh, Patty. I always knew that
I would deliver the Charmed Ones.

31:48.350 --> 31:50.268
Once removed, of course.

31:51.770 --> 31:53.980
Prue.

31:54.481 --> 31:56.399
Piper.

31:56.608 --> 31:58.068
- And...
- Phoebe.

31:58.276 --> 32:00.445
Oh, another P.

32:00.612 --> 32:02.989
- What a surprise.
- About the pact.

32:03.364 --> 32:06.493
We must keep the girls safe
until we can reverse it.

32:06.993 --> 32:10.497
- I'll have to bind their powers.
- Bind our powers?

32:11.331 --> 32:13.082
Strip them from the young ones

32:13.249 --> 32:17.670
so Nicholas can't get ahold of them.
It doesn't have to be done right away.

32:17.837 --> 32:22.008
As soon as Phoebe's born,
I'll cast a spell and suspend their...

32:22.175 --> 32:23.968
Your powers.

32:24.636 --> 32:27.305
Yeah, but that's exactly
what you did.

32:27.722 --> 32:29.599
Or, do.

32:29.807 --> 32:32.018
- Will do. You know what I mean.
- That explains

32:32.185 --> 32:34.687
why we don't remember having
our powers when we were younger.

32:34.896 --> 32:35.938
What do you mean?

32:36.314 --> 32:39.150
Well, how old were you
when you got your powers back?

32:40.318 --> 32:43.279
- We just got them.
- What?

32:44.489 --> 32:48.534
I unbound your powers
without having broken the pact?

32:48.743 --> 32:50.036
Why would I do that?

32:50.203 --> 32:53.539
I mean, unless I died, which,
of course, would automatically...

32:57.752 --> 32:59.211
Unbind your powers.

33:13.017 --> 33:16.645
Guess I'm not going to make it
to the next millennium, huh?

33:19.148 --> 33:22.735
- Speaking of that, Mom...
- No.

33:22.943 --> 33:24.695
We mustn't know about the future.

33:24.904 --> 33:28.115
You came back here
for one reason, to break the pact.

33:28.282 --> 33:31.285
You mustn't tamper with
anything else. It's much too risky.

33:31.452 --> 33:34.204
Heaven knows what damage
you've done by coming back here.

33:34.663 --> 33:38.042
We haven't done anything. We
missed our chance to stop the pact.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.127
And there's a reason for that.

33:40.294 --> 33:42.880
Destiny always gets its own way.

33:43.088 --> 33:46.216
It's not as easy to change
the past as you might think.

33:46.759 --> 33:50.721
And if you do it incorrectly,
everything will change.

33:52.598 --> 33:55.559
The evil that you vanquished,
the good that you've done,

33:55.726 --> 33:57.227
none of it may have ever happened.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.772
Well, we have to change this. We can't
go back and just let him kill us.

34:01.231 --> 34:02.983
The only way to vanquish him
in your time

34:03.150 --> 34:05.861
would be for me to unbless the ring
and take away its immunity.

34:06.069 --> 34:07.738
It's in a drawer in his hotel room.

34:07.905 --> 34:11.116
Okay, let's go to Nicholas'
hotel room and steal back the ring.

34:11.324 --> 34:13.659
- Hopefully it'll be there.
- It's too dangerous.

34:13.827 --> 34:15.370
You don't have powers.

34:15.536 --> 34:17.456
- I'll go.
- No.

34:17.664 --> 34:20.667
If something happened to you, future
history could be changed forever,

34:20.833 --> 34:22.960
just like Grams said. We have to go.

34:23.170 --> 34:26.255
Well, I'm glad to see that you
finally learned to listen to me.

34:26.715 --> 34:30.552
You better hurry. In the meantime,
I'll write a new spell

34:30.719 --> 34:32.762
that will get you back
to your own time.

34:32.971 --> 34:35.891
Wait, you can... You can do that?
You can send us home?

34:36.099 --> 34:39.978
We're witches, dear.
We can do anything.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.982
I wish that were true.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.820
Okay, we need to go.

34:50.030 --> 34:52.157
Be careful.

34:58.121 --> 35:01.124
Why am I not surprised
that you know how to do this?

35:01.291 --> 35:03.668
Let's just hope Nicholas isn't inside.

35:03.835 --> 35:07.839
The concierge says he's not,
and Piper's out front watching for him.

35:15.346 --> 35:17.932
Mom said it's in a drawer.

35:19.642 --> 35:21.144
Found it.

35:21.352 --> 35:23.354
Oh, okay.

35:27.525 --> 35:28.943
Okay.

35:29.152 --> 35:31.321
We gotta get it back to Mom.

35:34.949 --> 35:37.577
We have the ring. Here it is.

35:38.911 --> 35:41.497
- Okay, now what?
- Go back to where you belong.

35:41.706 --> 35:44.834
I'll unbless the ring and get it back
before Nicholas finds it missing.

35:45.001 --> 35:47.044
Now, remember,
there is no time to lose.

35:47.211 --> 35:50.256
You will return at the exact moment
you left. Nicholas will be there.

35:52.842 --> 35:54.510
Hopefully without immunity
to our powers.

35:54.719 --> 35:56.721
We'll be ready. Phoebe?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.306
Okay, I'm coming.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.852
I love you, Mom.

36:07.064 --> 36:09.066
I'm never gonna learn
to like lima beans, Grams,

36:09.233 --> 36:12.028
but thanks for everything else.

36:17.992 --> 36:20.161
You're going to be
a handful, aren't you?

36:20.327 --> 36:22.621
You'll learn to love me.

36:23.789 --> 36:26.041
Bye, Phoebe.

36:26.667 --> 36:28.836
I'm gonna miss you.

36:40.514 --> 36:45.102
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

36:45.311 --> 36:50.107
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

36:56.363 --> 36:58.115
Let me help.

36:58.323 --> 37:02.828
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

37:02.995 --> 37:07.624
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

37:15.591 --> 37:17.759
You did well, Patty.

37:18.802 --> 37:21.138
Oh, they're fabulous.

37:21.930 --> 37:24.057
I just hope they're safe.

37:35.986 --> 37:37.821
- What happened?
- Where did you go?

37:38.029 --> 37:40.157
We didn't go anywhere.
We were just standing here,

37:40.323 --> 37:42.784
- and the next thing we knew...
- We were just standing here.

37:42.993 --> 37:44.870
I told you to use poplar buds.

37:45.036 --> 37:48.957
It's a perfectly good spell.
I mean, it moved them through time.

37:49.165 --> 37:50.292
Yeah, ten seconds.

37:50.458 --> 37:53.128
It's not the spell. Must be
the power behind the spell.

37:53.295 --> 37:57.132
- There's not enough power.
- Maybe we need the power of three.

37:57.299 --> 38:00.927
The only problem is
it doesn't exist yet.

38:11.771 --> 38:13.398
Nothing.

38:13.773 --> 38:15.525
Maybe this is our destiny.

38:15.733 --> 38:18.069
Not for the Charmed Ones.

38:18.611 --> 38:20.321
We don't exist yet.

38:20.822 --> 38:24.158
- Yes. Yes, you do.
- No, not with powers.

38:24.617 --> 38:27.662
Yes, little Prue and Piper
have their powers.

38:27.829 --> 38:30.373
And Phoebe gave me a premonition,
so she must have hers.

38:30.957 --> 38:32.959
If we can teach the girls the chant,

38:33.126 --> 38:35.628
maybe the three of us
can get you back to your time.

38:35.795 --> 38:37.922
The power of three. It's worth a try.

38:38.089 --> 38:41.426
Where are you witches?
Where's my ring?

38:41.676 --> 38:44.137
- Nicholas.
- You and Piper get the girls.

38:44.303 --> 38:46.097
We'll fend him off.

38:51.227 --> 38:53.271
Come on, Phoebe.

38:59.944 --> 39:01.821
Oh, Grandma,
don't get too close, his power.

39:01.988 --> 39:04.323
- I know, I know.
- We can't risk you being hurt.

39:04.490 --> 39:05.950
Go help Mom start the spell.

39:06.117 --> 39:08.744
Phoebe and I will
take care of him. Come on.

39:19.255 --> 39:22.216
We're gonna play a little game, okay?
Now, give me your hands.

39:22.425 --> 39:24.468
- Okay, hurry.
- Now, repeat after me.

39:24.718 --> 39:29.056
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

39:29.265 --> 39:34.603
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

39:34.812 --> 39:38.524
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

39:38.691 --> 39:43.904
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

39:51.704 --> 39:56.125
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

39:56.291 --> 40:00.045
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

40:00.212 --> 40:03.590
- All right, we don't have much time.
- What about his ring?

40:03.799 --> 40:06.176
Don't worry about the ring now.
Let's just get you back.

40:06.385 --> 40:08.011
Well, but it is unblessed, right?

40:08.220 --> 40:10.430
Yes, but there wasn't time to test it.

40:10.639 --> 40:14.268
- Then how will we know if it works?
- You won't. Not until you get back.

40:14.476 --> 40:18.814
And since time will pick up right
where it left off, he won't know either.

40:20.524 --> 40:23.443
Goodbye, girls. Be good, darlings.

40:32.202 --> 40:36.498
<i>A time for everything
And to everything its place</i>

40:36.707 --> 40:40.794
<i>Return what has been moved
through time and space</i>

40:48.718 --> 40:50.971
It worked. We're back.

40:52.055 --> 40:53.682
Hurry.

41:00.772 --> 41:02.190
Time's up.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.324
All right, the ring's unblessed.

41:18.081 --> 41:21.167
- Phoebe, find anything?
- The Nicholas Must Die spell.

41:21.376 --> 41:24.295
- That wasn't there before.
- Maybe it's Grams' way of saying

41:24.462 --> 41:25.755
welcome back, or front.

41:25.964 --> 41:29.008
"Spell pouch included
at no extra charge."

41:29.175 --> 41:31.970
<i>Okay, okay.
Lavender, mimosa</i>

41:32.136 --> 41:33.429
<i>- Holy thistle
- Oh, dear.</i>

41:33.596 --> 41:37.809
<i>Cleanse this evil from our midst
Scatter its cells throughout time</i>

41:37.976 --> 41:40.603
<i>Let this Nick no more exist</i>

42:01.457 --> 42:04.836
I'm really glad I never
got on Grams' bad side.

42:05.795 --> 42:07.088
Right.

42:11.342 --> 42:13.386
I can't stop thinking about Mom.

42:13.552 --> 42:16.764
How I lost her and then
I found her again.

42:16.931 --> 42:20.142
I'm just glad that you
finally have memories of her.

42:20.559 --> 42:21.602
What?

42:21.769 --> 42:24.480
I'm supposed to throw out flowers
because they came from a creep?

42:24.647 --> 42:27.775
If that was the rule, we'd never
have flowers in this house.

42:27.942 --> 42:29.819
Well, but they didn't
just come from a creep.

42:30.027 --> 42:32.613
They came from a warlock
who tried to kill us.

42:32.780 --> 42:36.283
Still, if it weren't for him, I probably
would've never gotten to know Mom.

42:36.617 --> 42:38.369
We all wanted
to save Mom, Pheebs,

42:38.536 --> 42:41.664
but both Mom and Grams
said we can't change destiny.

42:41.831 --> 42:47.419
I know, but I still wrote
her a note anyway.

42:47.628 --> 42:49.797
- You did?
- Yes, I wrote her a note

42:49.964 --> 42:53.133
telling her to stay away from water
on the day that she died.

42:53.300 --> 42:55.469
<i>And then I put it in
the Book of Shadows.</i>

42:55.678 --> 42:58.972
- I can't believe you did that.
- You don't understand.

42:59.139 --> 43:02.768
Every time I've made a wish,
I've wished for time with Mom.

43:03.560 --> 43:07.064
And I believed in my heart
that someday,

43:07.231 --> 43:10.359
somehow,
that wish would come true.

43:10.526 --> 43:15.531
And when it finally did,
I didn't wanna let her go.

43:17.741 --> 43:20.869
You know, but then I realized
that I had to let her go.

43:23.914 --> 43:26.333
So I took the note out
and I put it in my pocket.

43:29.086 --> 43:31.922
Maturity sucks, doesn't it?

43:35.842 --> 43:38.679
But still, faith has its rewards.

43:41.014 --> 43:43.725
It's a pretty good one of us,
but once again,

43:43.892 --> 43:45.394
not a great one of you, Pheebs.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.437
Are you kidding?

43:47.604 --> 43:50.857
That is the best picture
of me I've ever taken.
