WEBVTT

00:06.640 --> 00:09.241
"HI, I'M RILEY MATTHEWS,

00:09.243 --> 00:12.378
AND THESE ARE YOUR
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL
MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS."

00:12.380 --> 00:13.445
WHY ARE YOU
EVEN REHEARSING?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.914
I'M GOING TO GET IT
PERFECT THIS TIME.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.316
AND YOU'RE ON.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.418
HEWO, I'M MILEY FLATSHOES

00:19.420 --> 00:22.454
AND THESE ARE
YOUR FLURNING AMOUSENITS.

00:22.456 --> 00:26.925
Today's lunch
in the cafamatorium
will be hot males.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.394
( laughing )

00:28.396 --> 00:31.497
HOT TAMALES...
I'M HOPING.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.433
HELLO, NEWS LADY!

00:34.435 --> 00:37.302
- CARPOOL!
- FAR-- CARPOOL?!
( laughing )

00:37.304 --> 00:39.371
AND HERE'S YOUR
FARKLE SCIENCE MOMENT.

00:40.975 --> 00:44.476
THE JUNIOR ENTOMOLOGY SOCIETY
HAS ONCE AGAIN NOMINATED ME
FOR A BUGGIE AWARD

00:44.478 --> 00:47.246
FOR MY RESEARCH PAPER
ON THE ORANGE DANCING SPIDER.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.365
CONGRATS,
DR. FARKLESTEIN.

00:49.366 --> 00:51.483
- I HOPE THIS IS YOUR YEAR.
- OH, I NEVER WIN.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.286
AWESOME.
WISH I COULD GO,

00:54.288 --> 00:56.488
BUT I DON'T WANNA
AND I'M SURE TICKETS
ARE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.258
- I HAVE TWO.
- THEN I JUST DON'T WANNA.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.994
AWESOME.  WHICH ONE OF YOU
WILL BE FARKLE'S CHOICE?

01:01.996 --> 01:03.962
I'm telling the world.
Farkle must finally choose

01:03.964 --> 01:06.498
between his sweet angel
whose smile lights
a path to goodness

01:06.500 --> 01:10.903
OR MY DARK DEMON
WHO UNLEASHES IN ME
SOMETHING SO TERRIFYING

01:10.905 --> 01:12.905
I REALLY WANNA KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

01:12.907 --> 01:17.476
THANKS, AND I'M NOT
GONNA BE THERE WHEN
YOU FIND OUT, CARPOOL.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.412
- AND THERE IT IS,
JOHN QUINCIATTI.
- ( laughing )

01:20.414 --> 01:24.316
FLANKLE JUICES
BEQUEEN YAMA AND SYMELF.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.319

02:27.014 --> 02:28.013
OF THE UNITED
STATES?

02:28.015 --> 02:29.448
FARKLE?

02:29.450 --> 02:30.749
I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU, SIR,

02:30.750 --> 02:32.049
BUT I GOT A LOT OF THINGS
ON MY MIND.

02:33.087 --> 02:35.320
ARE YOU TENSE, FARKLE?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.455
IS IT BUGGIE AWARD SEASON?

02:36.457 --> 02:38.390
YES, AND I KNOW THAT
ONCE I'VE CHOSEN

02:38.392 --> 02:39.875
BETWEEN RILEY AND MAYA
FOR THE DINNER,

02:39.876 --> 02:41.359
I'LL ACTUALLY BE LETTING
THE OTHER ONE GO.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.561
I'LL GO.
I'LL GO RIGHT NOW.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.331
I THINK IT WILL BE SAD

02:46.333 --> 02:48.100
WHEN FARKLE DOESN'T
LOVE US BOTH THE SAME.

02:48.102 --> 02:50.002
YES, ONE OF YOU
WILL BE CRUSHED.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.937
YOU WILL, HOWEVER,
RECEIVE THE FARKLE HOME GAME

02:51.939 --> 02:53.972
AS A CONSOLATION PRIZE.

02:53.974 --> 02:57.042
- OOH, WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S THIS GAME WHERE
THE LOSER GOES,

02:57.044 --> 03:00.512
( mimics sobbing )
"FARKLE."

03:00.514 --> 03:03.348
SO WHO IS THE GREATEST ALLY
OF THE UNITED STATES?

03:03.350 --> 03:05.417
- ASK FARKLE.
- ( sighs )

03:07.087 --> 03:09.421
CANADA.
YOU WANT ME
TO SAY CANADA.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.124
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY
OR DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING?

03:13.928 --> 03:16.428
EVERYTHING.
YOU LOVE THAT.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.032
LOOK, I REALLY
WANT ONE OF YOU
AT THE BUGGIES WITH ME

03:20.034 --> 03:22.434
TO PICK ME UP
WHEN I LOSE AGAIN
TO MY ARCHNEMESIS SMACKLE.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.403
( chuckles ) SMACKLE?
WHAT KIND OF PARENTS

03:24.405 --> 03:27.005
NAME THEIR KID
"SMACKLE," FARKLE?  OH.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.475
IT'S JUST INTERESTING
THAT ALL OF OUR THOUGHTS

03:30.477 --> 03:32.077
TURN TO OTHER ALLIES FIRST

03:32.079 --> 03:34.413
WHEN CANADA IS
RIGHT NEXT TO US.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.983
PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE
WE KNOW THEY'LL ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR US

03:37.985 --> 03:40.085
THAT WE TAKE THEM
FOR GRANTED.

03:40.087 --> 03:43.155
FARKLE, I'M GOING TO MAKE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE

03:43.157 --> 03:46.058
- AND LET YOU GO WITH RILEY.
- YEAH, WELL, I'M GOING TO

03:46.060 --> 03:48.460
MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE
AND LET YOU GO WITH MAYA.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.162
I DECIDE!
YOU HEAR ME?

03:50.164 --> 03:52.130
THIS GAME IS
FARKLE'S CHOICE.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.433
PREPARE TO GO THROUGH

03:54.435 --> 03:56.501
THE EMOTIONAL GAUNTLET
OF LOVE.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.071
Both: OKAY.

04:04.078 --> 04:07.946
JUDY, I'M SO GLAD
YOU WERE ABLE TO JOIN
OUR LITTLE BOOK CLUB.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.115
AUGGIE IS SUCH A FAN
OF YOUR DAUGHTER AVA.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.951
- ( British accent )
OH WELL, WHO ISN'T?
- ( mouths )

04:12.953 --> 04:16.088
AND I MUST SAY,
WHAT A SURPRISINGLY
DECENT IDEA, TOPANGA.

04:16.090 --> 04:19.057
I THINK A BOOK CLUB IS
SUCH A WONDERFUL FORUM

04:19.059 --> 04:22.127
TO EXCHANGE IDEAS
AND INTELLECTUAL
CONVERSATION.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.063
JUDY, ARE YOU BRITISH?

04:25.065 --> 04:27.499
NO, I'M JUST BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.102
WOW.
( chuckles )

04:30.104 --> 04:33.038
WELL, I SEE
WHERE YOUR DAUGHTER
GETS HER CONFIDENCE.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.575
OH, AND AUGGIE
IS SUCH A LOVELY
LITTLE GIRL AS WELL.

04:39.146 --> 04:42.047
- AUGGIE IS A BOY.
- OH.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.016
I'VE NEVER REALLY
LOOKED AT HER.
( giggles )

04:45.452 --> 04:48.520
UCCH.
OKAY, EVERYONE,

04:48.522 --> 04:51.123
I HOPE WE ALL ENJOYED
OUR FIRST BOOK,

04:51.125 --> 04:53.091
"MURRAY
THE MARVELOUS MOOSE."

04:53.093 --> 04:54.993
- SO WHO WOULD
LIKE TO START?
- AVA.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.495
( mutters )
OH BOY.

04:56.497 --> 05:00.032
MURRAY MOOSE DISCOVERS
HIS SELF-WORTH

05:00.034 --> 05:03.068
IN A WORLD
CONSTANTLY CHALLENGING

05:03.070 --> 05:05.003
HIS SENSE OF...

05:05.005 --> 05:07.606
- ( mimics cough ) IDENTITY.
- ( mimics cough ) ...IDENTITY.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.509
MMM.  AN INTERESTING

05:10.511 --> 05:13.178
AND I'M SURE
WELL-REHEARSED
INTERPRETATION.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.247
( mimics polite cough )

05:15.249 --> 05:19.051
- WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?
- ( British accent ) I'M NOT
IMPLYING ANYTHING.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.187
( normal voice )
I'M SAYING IT RIGHT
IN YOUR FACE.

05:23.524 --> 05:26.491
SO WHO HAS
A DIFFERENT TAKE?

05:26.493 --> 05:30.128
- AUGGIE?
- I ATED ONE OF THE PAGES.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.565
I'M NOT WITH HIM
FOR HIS BRAINS.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.202
- CHECK OUT
THAT TUSH.
- OH!

05:38.505 --> 05:41.573
- AVA!
- I'M OKAY WITH IT, MOM.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.511
ALL RIGHT, AVA,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO READ
AN EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK?

05:46.513 --> 05:49.281
"ONE DAY, MURRAY THE MOOSE

05:49.283 --> 05:51.049
WOKE UP AND DIDN'T WANT

05:51.051 --> 05:52.651
TO BE A MOOSE ANYMORE."

05:52.652 --> 05:54.252
SO GOOD.  SO GOOD.
THAT WAS REALLY VERY GOOD.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.121
YES.  NOW, AUGGIE,
IT'S YOUR TURN.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.290
I LIKE IT BETTER WHEN
YOU READ TO ME, MOMMY.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.125
AREN'T YOU
A LITTLE OLD FOR THAT?

06:00.127 --> 06:02.327
- AM I, MOMMY?
- ( emphatically ) NO.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.196
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
TOPANGA.

06:04.198 --> 06:08.300
IT'S A SCIENTIFICALLY-PROVEN
FACT THAT BOYS DEVELOP
AT A DIFFERENT PACE.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.079
THANK YOU
FOR MY SMOOTHIE.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.215
EXTRA THICK SO YOU CAN
EAT IT WITH A SPOON.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.984
YOU KNOW ME VERY WELL.
( giggles )

06:25.986 --> 06:28.086
THAT GIGGLE IS
MY FAVORITE SOUND
IN THE WORLD.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.222
I KNOW I'VE TOLD YOU
I'VE LOVED YOU SINCE
THE FIRST GRADE,

06:30.224 --> 06:32.157
BUT I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER TOLD YOU WHY.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.126
- FARKLE--
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.996
HAVE A LITTLE PRETZEL
WITH YOUR MUSTARD, MAYA.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.297
I KNOW
HOW YOU LIKE IT.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.967
I'M EATING THIS,
THEN I'M LEAVING.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.035
MY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.072
DON'T REMEMBER IT
AT ALL.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.574
BING!

06:51.245 --> 06:55.981
- YOU KEPT THIS?
- YOU TRIED TO DO A KICKFLIP
OFF THE PARK BENCH.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.216
YOU WERE NOT READY
FOR THOSE MOVES.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.185
STILL GOT THE SCAR.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.088
IT WAS THE ONLY TIME
I'VE EVER SEEN YOU CRY.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.190
WHY DID YOU KEEP THIS?

07:05.192 --> 07:08.293
IT WAS THE ONLY TIME
I'VE EVER SEEN YOU CRY.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.362
FARKLE.

07:10.364 --> 07:14.032
HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING
SOMEONE ELSE?

07:14.034 --> 07:17.169
- THERE'S ONLY YOU.
- DON'T THINK IT'S
GOING TO BE SO EASY

07:17.171 --> 07:19.337
TO GET ME ALL EMOTIONAL
OVER SOME LITTLE OBJECT

07:19.339 --> 07:21.173
THAT SHOOTS ME DOWN
MEMORY LANE.

07:21.175 --> 07:24.042
- BING.
- HAZEL THE HIPPO.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.011
YOU'RE ALIVE!

07:26.013 --> 07:28.246
YOU GAVE ME THIS
WHEN YOU SAT WITH ME
IN THE HOSPITAL

07:28.248 --> 07:30.248
WHEN I HAD
MY TONSILS OUT.

07:30.250 --> 07:34.252
I LOST HER AND NEVER HAD
THE HEART TO TELL YOU.

07:34.254 --> 07:37.322
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?
- I BOUGHT TWO OF THEM,

07:37.324 --> 07:40.158
YOU KNOW,
JUST IN CASE, YOU LOST
THE ONE I GAVE YOU.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.194
THANK YOU, FARKLE.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.330
THANK YOU, FARKLE.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.301
Girls:
ARE YOU SPEED-DATING US?

07:49.303 --> 07:51.136
WELCOME TO WHAT'S GOING ON!

07:51.138 --> 07:53.238
AS YOU KNOW,
BEING NOMINATED
FOR A BUGGIE

07:53.240 --> 07:56.041
- IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY LIFE.
- WE REALIZE THAT.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.310
I WANNA SHARE MY HAPPINESS
WITH SOMEONE SPECIAL IF I WIN,

07:58.312 --> 08:01.079
AND IF I LOSE,
I WANT SOMEONE WHO CARES
ABOUT ME TO BE THERE.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.181
SO I WANNA MAKE SURE
I MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.083
THANK YOU
FOR A LOVELY EVENING.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.119
WOW.  HE'S PAYING THE BILL.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.387
I SHOULD'VE EATEN MORE.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.125
HEY, YO,
YOU STILL HUNGRY?

08:14.127 --> 08:17.229
'CAUSE WE'RE
GONNA GET SOME PIZZA,
SO WE'RE THINKING--

08:17.231 --> 08:19.064
STOP THINKING.
IT'S NOT YOU.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.366
WHAT'S SHE MEAN BY THAT?

08:21.368 --> 08:24.269
WHAT MY BROTHER SHELDON
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

08:24.271 --> 08:25.754
IS THAT BECAUSE
OF OUR DEMEANOR,

08:25.755 --> 08:27.238
YOU THINK THAT WE'RE
A COUPLE OF OAFS.

08:27.241 --> 08:30.275
- IS THIS TRUE?
- I'M AFRAID SO, SHELDON.

08:30.277 --> 08:33.411
- OAFS?!
- WE ARE SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.082
WHAT'S THE OTHER ONE
THINK, CISCO?

08:37.084 --> 08:38.416
YOU SHOULD
FIND OUT BY ASKING.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.053
WHAT DO YOU THINK...

08:42.055 --> 08:43.355
OTHER ONE?

08:43.357 --> 08:45.190
I THINK
YOU'RE WAY TOO CLOSE.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.259
AND WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT THAT?

08:49.129 --> 08:52.097
I MAY NOT LOOK SO TOUGH,
AND I DON'T SAY "YO,"

08:52.099 --> 08:55.333
BUT I'M INSANE
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TWO,

08:55.335 --> 08:57.002
SO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO

08:57.004 --> 08:58.270
IS RUN DOWN
THE PLATFORM SCREAMING

08:58.272 --> 09:00.272
UNTIL YOU REACH BROADWAY.

09:00.274 --> 09:02.307
I JUST DON'T
SEE US SCREAMING
UNTIL BROADWAY.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.043
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE ANYWAY?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.444
OH, ME?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.281
( boys scream )

09:13.086 --> 09:14.386
I'M CANADA.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.122
A LITTLE TAKEN
FOR GRANTED, BUT...

09:17.124 --> 09:18.356
I'M ALWAYS
THERE FOR YOU.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.997
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE DECIDED TO GO
WITH FARKLE.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.365
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.  I'M GOING.
- I SAID I'M GOING.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.201
- I WILL MESS YOU UP.
- THEN I WILL CLEAN ME UP.  HA!

09:30.203 --> 09:32.003
RILEY, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

09:32.005 --> 09:33.371
ARE WE REALLY
FIGHTING OVER FARKLE?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.343
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA WIN.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.313
IT'S ON, MATTHEWS.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.025
SO DID YOU
TEXT HIM LAST NIGHT?

09:54.027 --> 09:55.360
NO.  WE AGREED NOT TO.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.229
FARKLE'S CHOICE, REMEMBER?

09:58.231 --> 10:00.298
- DID YOU VIDEO CHAT?
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.168
WE AGREED TO DO NOTHING
TO INFLUENCE HIM.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.436
THAT'S THE DEAL.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.439
- LADIES.
- Both: FARKLE.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.108
THANKS FOR THE TEXT, MAYA.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.077
I ENJOYED
THE VIDEO CHAT, RILEY.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.283
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
SOME TIME TO MYSELF TO MAKE
THIS DIFFICULT CHOICE.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.219
- AND MAYA AND I AGREED
WE WOULD DO NOTHING...
- <i> ( locker opens )</i>

10:21.221 --> 10:24.322
- ...TO INFLUENCE
YOUR DECISION.
- YEAH.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.358

10:31.298 --> 10:33.198
AN ARIZONA
BLONDE TARANTULA.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.067
- WELL, OF COURSE.
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS, MAYA!

10:36.069 --> 10:38.403
WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT THIS SPECIES,
IT'S THE PERFECT MATE FOR--

10:38.405 --> 10:41.239
- FOR MY ORANGE
DANCING SPIDER.
- YEAH.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.175
THIS IS
COMPLETELY UNFAIR.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.177
LOOK AT THESE TWO.
SO VASTLY DIFFERENT

10:46.179 --> 10:49.247
- AND YET
SO WONDERFUL TOGETHER.
- WELL, OF COURSE.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.732

10:52.219 --> 10:55.053
- ( kids scream )
- SHE BIT HIS HEAD OFF!

10:55.055 --> 10:57.122
JUST LIKE OUR LIVES
ARE GONNA BE TOGETHER.

10:58.325 --> 11:03.328
NO.  MAYA IS NOT
THE ONLY ONE WHO
LIKES SPIDERS, OKAY?

11:03.330 --> 11:06.164
- I HAPPEN
TO LOVE THEM TOO.
- REALLY?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.366
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE
NO PROBLEM IF I PUT
THIS SPIDER ON YOUR HEAD

11:08.368 --> 11:11.369
- AND YOU WORE IT LIKE A HAT?
- A HAT, YOU SAY?

11:18.245 --> 11:20.345
I KNOW THIS IS OUT
OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE, RILEY.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.180
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED
YOU WOULD DO THIS FOR ME.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.250
YEAH, I STILL CAN'T DECIDE
WHO I'M BRINGING
TO THE BUGGIES.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.252
- YOU'RE BOTH STILL EVEN.
- ( sighs )

11:27.254 --> 11:32.023
HI, DAD, THIS SPIDER
IS LAYING HER EGGS
IN MY BRAIN.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.258
YEAH, OKAY.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.267
"MURRAY THE MOOSE REALIZED

11:42.269 --> 11:44.369
IT IS MUCH BETTER
TO BE WHO YOU ARE

11:44.371 --> 11:46.371
THAN TO PRETEND
TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE,

11:46.373 --> 11:49.374
EVEN IF YOUR
FAKE BRITISH MOTHER
WANTS YOU TO BE."

11:49.376 --> 11:51.176
WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT?

11:51.178 --> 11:53.211
IT DOESN'T
SAY THAT IN MINE.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.245
MM, YES.
WELL, PERHAPS YOU'RE
NOT THE ONLY ONE

11:55.248 --> 11:57.182
WITH A WELL-REHEARSED CHILD.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.352
I STILL LIKE IT BETTER
WHEN YOU READ TO ME, MOMMY.

12:01.354 --> 12:05.156
WHY?  MY MOMMY
NEVER READS TO ME.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.192
SHE SAYS
IT MAKES ME WEAK.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.259
OH.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.162
SO THEN WHO
ACTS OUT THE PARTS

12:11.164 --> 12:13.164
AND DOES THE VOICES

YOU CAN DO THAT?

12:14.334 --> 12:18.103
WELL, LET'S SEE.  CORY?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.239
CORY?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.308
OH.  YEAH, RIGHT.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.312
"ONE DAY,
MURRAY THE MOOSE SAID"...

12:27.314 --> 12:29.380
( deep voice )
"I'M TIRED OF BEING
A MOOSE."

12:29.382 --> 12:31.082
( kids laughing )

12:31.084 --> 12:33.418
"I WANNA BE A PORPOISE,
LIKE YOU, PENELOPE,

12:33.420 --> 12:36.254
AND SWIM IN THE SEA."

12:36.256 --> 12:39.324
( high-pitched )
"BUT, MURRAY, DO YOU
EVEN KNOW HOW TO SWIM?"

12:39.326 --> 12:41.359
"LET'S FIND OUT!"

12:41.361 --> 12:44.395
- SPLOOSH!  "OH!"

12:44.397 --> 12:47.132
"HELP ME!

12:47.134 --> 12:50.301
"OKAY, I WILL GATHER
ALL OF MY OCEAN FRIENDS.

12:50.303 --> 12:54.105
COME ON, OCEAN FRIENDS,
HELP SAVE MURRAY!"

12:54.107 --> 12:56.374
"AND ALL OF THE OCEAN FRIENDS
WORKED TOGETHER

12:56.376 --> 12:58.243
AND SAVED MURRAY.

AVA, LET'S GO.

13:15.395 --> 13:19.063
I LIKE IT WHEN
TOPANGA THROWS ME OUT.

13:19.065 --> 13:22.267
- EXCUSE ME?
- OH, ME TOO.

13:22.269 --> 13:26.137

- Topanga and Ava: WHEE!

13:26.139 --> 13:28.373

"AND THEN MURRAY DECIDED

IN THAT WEIRD FAKE WAY?

14:19.392 --> 14:22.360
WELL, I WAS JUST PICTURING YOU
AT THIS DINNER WITH MAYA.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.196
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
SO DON'T BELONG TOGETHER.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.265
- YOU DON'T THINK WE DO?
- NOT AT ALL.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.302
- DO YOU THINK WE DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.405
- DO YOU?

LOCKED!
HA.  LOCKED.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.285
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

14:48.421 --> 14:50.355
YOU TRIED TO LOCK ME
OUT OF YOUR ROOM?

14:50.357 --> 14:53.291
- NOT COOL.
- YOU'RE INTERRUPTING
MY ALONE TIME WITH FARKLE?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.326
- NOT COOL!
- YOU'RE ACTUALLY
FIGHTING OVER ME?!

14:55.328 --> 14:57.362
COOL!

14:57.364 --> 15:00.331
EXCEPT YOU'RE FIGHTING
AND IT'S MY FAULT.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.267
CAN EITHER OF YOU TELL ME
WHY YOU'D EVEN WANT

15:02.269 --> 15:04.202
TO GO WITH ME
TO THE BUGGIE AWARDS?

15:06.106 --> 15:08.339
YEAH.  WELL, I CAN
TELL YOU WHY I'VE ALWAYS
LOVED YOU BOTH.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.142
I CAN'T THINK OF ONE OF YOU
WITHOUT THINKING
OF BOTH OF YOU.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.145
I WITHDRAW MY OFFER.

15:18.285 --> 15:21.252
I'D RATHER GO ALONE
THAN HURT MY TWO BEST FRIENDS.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.154
THAT'S MY CHOICE.

What a leak
it has been,

21:10.937 --> 21:13.971

have lost his boogies,

21:16.509 --> 21:19.076
