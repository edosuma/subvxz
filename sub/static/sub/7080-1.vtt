- How you doin' bro?
- You seen Melvin?

00:45.837 --> 00:47.874
No, man. I ain't seen
that cat in a long time.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.000
Jo-Sho.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.923

Y'all seen Melvin?

00:57.099 --> 00:57.964
That crazy white dude?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.048
Yeah, white chocolate.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.724
Man, I ain't seen
Melvin in a while.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.057
Melvin's somewhere though.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.479
He's somewhere
to be found.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.729
But what you looking
for Melvin for?

01:08.819 --> 01:10.560
Boy gotta go to court.

01:10.654 --> 01:11.644
He goin' be late.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.194
Trouble again, huh?

01:13.282 --> 01:15.364
He ain't never gonna get his son
back acting like this, man.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.988
He looks like he should stop
doing everything he been doing.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.240
They ain't stoppin' shit.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.866
- Let me go find his ass.
- Somebody gon' find him.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.574
- A repeat. A repeat.
- Somebody gon' find him.

01:24.668 --> 01:25.783
I'll catch y'all
on another side.

01:25.877 --> 01:26.787
You take care of yourself.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.835
- Alright.
- Alright.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.503
Melvin!

01:33.594 --> 01:35.926
Where you at, you
mother fucker?

01:37.055 --> 01:38.841
I told y'all.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.344
You wanna make a
movie about Melvin?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.642
You gon' to spend half of
your time trying to find

01:43.729 --> 01:45.265
this mother fucker.

01:45.981 --> 01:46.937
You seen Melvin?

01:47.024 --> 01:48.765
No, I ain't seen
that mother fucker.

01:48.859 --> 01:49.849
Damn!

01:51.111 --> 01:52.351
Hey, if you see him tell
him to head on home!

01:52.446 --> 01:53.231
Alright, I got that.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.562
Alright.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.571
Y'all seen Melvin?

01:59.661 --> 02:00.901
I ain't seen that
mother fucker.

02:00.996 --> 02:02.202
You ain't seen
that mother fucker?

02:02.289 --> 02:03.450
- Who's that?
- Melvin.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.827
- No.
- Ah, shit.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.876
Every mother fucking
time something going on,

02:09.963 --> 02:12.295
this mother fucker
gotta disappear.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.920
Melvin!

02:15.010 --> 02:16.842
There's the mother
fucker's bike.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.223
And there's the
mother fucker's shoe.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.189
There's the other shoe.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.017
Attached to this
ig'nant mother fucker.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.186
Melvin!

02:35.280 --> 02:37.442
Get your ass up, man!

02:37.532 --> 02:39.819
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

02:39.910 --> 02:42.527
Acting like your ass
is homeless and shit.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.955
- Stole my shoe?
- I found your damn shoe.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.377
Oh, yeah? What's it doing
in your hand then?

02:52.464 --> 02:54.250
What the fuck is it
doing off your foot?

02:54.341 --> 02:55.957
It's sitting
right over there.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.668
You look like shit.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.594
Fuck.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.845
I remember the
party and then...

03:05.936 --> 03:08.268
Man, you left about 4 A.M.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.312
Just slipped off
into the darkness.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.479
Did I dream it or
did I get with Caroline?

03:14.569 --> 03:16.560
You better hope you didn't
get with that fat bitch.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.817
She two hundred and
fifty pounds, man.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.318
She's kinda foxy though.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.275
That fox don't need to eat
for another three years.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.780
Now, come on, man.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.827
That's better.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.750
You know you gotta be
in court this morning.

03:31.837 --> 03:32.793
What?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.086
You gotta be in
court this morning.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.629
Why didn't you
say that earlier?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.003
What the fuck you think I've
been trying to say to you, man?

03:38.093 --> 03:39.174
- Come on, man.
- Fuck.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.751
- Shit.
- Damn it, Melvin.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.713
Riding around town all god damn
morning looking for your ass.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.093
We gotta go man.
I gotta change.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.469
Yeah, no shit?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.345
Fuck.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.180
Shit, shower, and shave.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.888
Shit, it smell like a pack
of horses coming at a

03:51.982 --> 03:53.643
mother fucker ass first.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.691
How the fuck you
end up over here?

03:55.777 --> 03:56.983
I mean, you my brother
and I love you,

03:57.070 --> 03:59.357
but sometimes you do
some silly ass shit.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.688
Fucking thing! Come on!

04:00.782 --> 04:01.738
Man, ride.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.942
Complaining about
you fuckin' up.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.322
The fuck.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.576
Stupid, Melvin.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.781
Fucking stupid.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.833
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about. Shit.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.497
So you had to stay
out all night, huh?

04:21.511 --> 04:24.378
One of these days.

04:24.473 --> 04:25.838
Ha! One, two, three!

04:25.932 --> 04:27.889
Come on!

04:27.976 --> 04:28.966
Shit.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.676
Man, I can do this
my god damn self.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.011
I'm trying to
help you, man.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.096
Do it look like I need
your help, mother fucker?

04:34.191 --> 04:35.431
Well, you are in a
wheelchair, you know?

04:35.525 --> 04:36.435
I ain't no spastic.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.436
I never said you were.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.109
You want my help or not?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.686
One of these days I'm
going to get my a new

04:40.781 --> 04:43.899
chair that don't need no skinny
ass to push it up ramps.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.482
Will you stop
your moaning?

04:45.577 --> 04:49.115
One of those carbon fiber mother
fuckers that do tricks and shit.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.879
Come on, buddy.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.801
You know, you look so handsome
when you make the effort.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.632
I don't understand why you
have to dress like a hobo.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.512
Oh, come on, mom.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.139
How do I look, Luc?

05:13.230 --> 05:15.722
Judge will give you five years
for wearing that cheap suit.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.272
- Jesus.
- Lucille, leave him alone.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.646
He looks just like he did
on his first day of school.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.602
I was just joking, Miss H.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.653
The judge is going
to dig you, bro.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.525
Alright, you wanna
hear my letter?

05:24.616 --> 05:25.276
Sure.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.486
Why not? Lay it on me.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.816
Okay.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.323
Dear sir, I know I haven't
exactly been the best

05:30.413 --> 05:32.495
father to date, but I'm
here today to tell you

05:32.582 --> 05:35.620
that I can't be a better
father if I'm in prison.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.701
All I want to do is see
my boy again and I'll do

05:37.796 --> 05:40.037
whatever you ask me just to
spend some time with time.

05:40.131 --> 05:43.249
He loves his father
and he needs me.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.300
And if you give me the
chance, I am capable of

05:45.387 --> 05:48.846
being a stable and solid
influence in his life.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.468
Now the charge of
kidnapping sounds very

05:50.559 --> 05:53.677
extreme to me because it's
not in fact what happened.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.181
We just wanted to go
on a holiday together,

05:55.272 --> 05:57.229
me and Rex, is all.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.181
Maybe I didn't
handle it right, sir.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.517
I understand, but my ex is
a real pain in the ass--

06:01.611 --> 06:04.603
Man, you cannot say that
stuff to the judge, man.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.531
Yeah, you gotta let the
judge decide the rest.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.073
Come on, man.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.117
Okay, here are your sandwiches
in case it goes on a while.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.036
Crust off for Lucille,
crust on for you.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.705
Okay, great.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.872
Hey, good luck, bro.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.666
You look like a fucking
hobo in that suit.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.083
Hey, thanks, sis.

06:19.170 --> 06:19.830
Love you.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.620
Love you, more.

06:20.672 --> 06:21.412
I can do it myself.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.420
No, you can't.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.212
Boy, what you think
about the ride?

06:23.258 --> 06:24.248
Oh, it's dope, man.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.332
Where'd you get it?

06:25.427 --> 06:27.009
Oh, man, borrowed
it from my uncle.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.927
Know you gotta make a good
impression on thatjudge, right?

06:29.014 --> 06:30.004
A good impression?

06:30.098 --> 06:32.214
What kind of
narcotic you on, son?

06:32.309 --> 06:33.674
- Thanks for doing this, man.
- Anytime!

06:33.768 --> 06:35.099
Hey, Miss H,
how we looking?

06:35.186 --> 06:37.393
Like the Village People.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.436
Love you, Ma.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.059
Get out of here
before you're late.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.936
Thank you, Miss H!

06:42.027 --> 06:43.438
Courthouse.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.485
Be careful.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.634
I'm running late.
Come on, let's move.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.262
You got this, Melvin.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.268
You got this.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.558
Alright.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.473
Hey, kick some ass, bro.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.904
Good luck, man.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.385
Hey, man. What happened?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.432
Fucking prick gave me a
community service order.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.392
He banned all contact with
Rex, pending assessment.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.768
Well, at least you didn't
go to jail, right?

08:03.858 --> 08:05.724
Yeah, I wanna
see my kid, man.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.729
Get it?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.402
Fuck!

08:10.407 --> 08:12.364
Aw, what other way
could it have gone?

08:12.450 --> 08:13.781
This stupid bitch.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.029
Don't do it, brother.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.360
Thank you.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.195
- No, no, no!
- Mel, Mel!

08:19.708 --> 08:21.415
Feeling good about
yourself, Doreen?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.333
So are you gonna tell Rex that
you banned me from seeing him?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.833
Or are you gonna lie like you
normally do and blame it on me?

08:26.923 --> 08:28.709
The judge banned
you, not me.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.040
Yeah, cause you fucking
instructed him.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.342
Melvin, do not
swear at me, okay?

08:32.429 --> 08:33.965
I'm not
intimidated by you.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.886
Those days are past us.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.429
Doreen, please.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.133
Don't do this to me.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.684
You're hurting Rex just as
much as you're hurting me.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.933
I mean, why do you
have to be so cruel?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.358
What did I ever do
to hurt you so bad?

08:47.444 --> 08:49.355
You need reminding.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.653
Please don't do this.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.196
It's done, okay?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.024
The judge has
passed it down.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.160
Yeah, well, when Rex is
older, he's gonna hate you

08:59.247 --> 09:00.408
for using him
to get at me.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.284
I am not using him.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.831
I just don't want him to
live amongst the wreckage

09:03.918 --> 09:05.374
that is your life.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.827
Look at you!

09:06.921 --> 09:09.162
You have no manners
and no grace.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.501
And I abhor what
you've become.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.645
H6)'-

09:49.798 --> 09:51.163
Yeah!

09:51.257 --> 09:53.214
Woo!

10:05.522 --> 10:10.312
That mother fucker George Bush,
sent us over to Iraq in '91.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.768
82nd Airborne Division.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.853
Man, I remember that first push.
We're going through Boswa.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.655
We was tripping.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.607
I get hit by this sniper.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.533
Mother fucker tagged
me from behind.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.578
Took out my lower spine.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.712
Love you guys-

10:39.931 --> 10:43.299
My wife, she was so
ashamed of having a

10:43.393 --> 10:46.101
husband that the stank
bitch didn't even show up

10:46.187 --> 10:48.929
to Fort Brag when they
sent my ass home.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.138
But Melvin did.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.019
Him and his momma.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.774
Told me I could stay with them
til I got my shit together.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.730
One of these days he's gonna
get his shit together.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.235
You know what he said?

10:59.325 --> 11:03.364
He said I could stay with him
til I get back on my feet.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.569
What kinda shit is that?

11:04.664 --> 11:05.620
Back on my feet.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.449
Right.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.079
Jump!

11:15.758 --> 11:16.714
Shit!

11:18.261 --> 11:20.377
You alright, man?

11:20.471 --> 11:22.462
I'm good, I'm
good, I'm good!

11:27.103 --> 11:29.060
I'm good.
Baby, I'm good.

11:34.861 --> 11:35.817
Lucas is here.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.269
What?

11:37.363 --> 11:38.945
<i>Luke“!</i>

11:39.032 --> 11:40.943
With his
spectacles and all.

11:41.492 --> 11:44.280
Yeah, Lukey!

11:45.955 --> 11:48.913
The mother
fucking science teacher.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.054
Melvin is not like
other people.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.350
Ever since we were kids,
we came to discover he had

12:08.436 --> 12:10.848
um, abilities to move
objects using only the

12:10.939 --> 12:12.725
power of his mind.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.896
Okay, so um...

12:13.983 --> 12:16.270
on first glance, if
you look at both heads,

12:16.361 --> 12:18.602
you don't see
anything different.

12:18.696 --> 12:22.280
Now, let's look at
Melvin's again.

12:23.493 --> 12:27.361
Here, we start to notice
very small anomalies on

12:27.455 --> 12:29.537
the outer sleeve
of the brain.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.082
That's about the only thing
that I see that's different.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.249
And I've been...

12:33.336 --> 12:35.247
I've studied this guy
for over a decade.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.500
Everything else about
him reads normal.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.675
I run tests on every other part
of his body and found nothing.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.719
Now, Mel he comes in from time
to time and we check to,

12:44.806 --> 12:46.763
you know, to see if his
blood clean, his brain is

12:46.849 --> 12:48.135
flowing, simple stuff.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.682
We don't publicize.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.887
We don't talk about anything
outside of my laboratory.

12:52.981 --> 12:56.440
Truth is, and he don't
mind me saying this,

12:56.526 --> 12:58.563
and speaking as
a professional,

12:58.653 --> 13:01.145
he has so much to offer
the world of science

13:01.239 --> 13:03.196
and there's so much
potential for him.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.549
Wee-ha!

14:08.639 --> 14:09.424
Yes, sir!

14:09.515 --> 14:10.880
- Yes, sir!
- Hallelujah!

14:10.975 --> 14:12.306
Nice, reverend!

14:16.439 --> 14:17.975
Here on this beautiful
afternoon,

14:18.066 --> 14:19.932
you're about to
experience magic.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.518
Yes, I tell you,
beautiful, magic.

14:22.612 --> 14:27.231
You are gonna watch this
wheelchair levitate in the air.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.315
Oh, yeah!

14:28.409 --> 14:29.695
Levitate!

14:29.786 --> 14:32.153
But to make this trick
successful, I need a dollar.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.828
Yes, I ain't say
thirty-five cents and no,

14:33.915 --> 14:35.280
I didn't say no
fifty-five cents.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.206
I need a dollar.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.248
Going once.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.325
And you, the
beautiful in the pink.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.079
Thank you so very much.

14:39.128 --> 14:39.959
Anyone else?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.036
You got one more
dollar, brother.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.791
Give me that last one.
This is the one.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.088
Let's go, let's
go, let's go!

14:44.175 --> 14:45.040
Anybody else?

14:45.134 --> 14:46.420
You're gonna
watch some magic.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.797
I promise you that.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.049
Criss Angel ain't got
nothing on this trick.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.379
Now, here we go!

14:51.474 --> 14:53.556
Everyone, are you ready?

14:53.643 --> 14:56.305
The best act out
of the West Bank.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.353
My main man, a
hundred grand.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.306
Here he is y'all!

15:03.903 --> 15:07.191
That's my boy!

15:12.995 --> 15:14.235
He's settling in.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.617
It's a part of
the meditation.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.244
Let the magic man do
what the magic man do.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.169
Pictures ain't free.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.339
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
it is about to go down.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.550
Oh, yes!

15:29.637 --> 15:30.923
What'd I tell you!

15:31.013 --> 15:32.424
Do not try this at home.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.505
I need a dollar.
I need a dollar.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.181
Anybody else?
Come on, come on.

15:35.268 --> 15:42.015
That's what I'm
talking about.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.894
Come on! You see,
that's magic.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.942
Give it up for him y'all!

16:12.263 --> 16:13.424
Melvin!

16:14.974 --> 16:16.931
The kitchen furniture
moves you're doing,

16:17.018 --> 16:18.634
please can you put it back?

16:18.728 --> 16:20.344
Yeah, mom, I'm playing
the piano here.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.851
Please put the table and
chairs back where they belong.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.859
You know I don't love
you touching my stuff.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.945
Coming.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.872
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.540
And the lamp.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.421
What is up with you, love?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.624
Hey, Melvin?

16:50.718 --> 16:52.675
My curling iron,
it's shorted.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.344
So? Is that my problem?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.262
Um, yeah, actually
it is your problem.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.464
It's you're fucking fault.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.673
- You, language.
- What are you talking about?

16:58.768 --> 17:00.054
Okay, do you see my hair?

17:00.144 --> 17:01.930
Do you want me to go see
Ryan like this? Really?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.729
No, Ryan or not, you do
not curse in this house.

17:04.815 --> 17:05.724
Okay. Well, you know what?

17:05.816 --> 17:06.977
Thanks a lot, Melvin.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.058
You're a dick.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.563
Can't wait to meet, Ryan.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.611
- Fuck off.
- He sounds lovely.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.405
Are you feeling okay?

17:14.492 --> 17:15.607
Sure, mom.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.237
Never better.

17:30.758 --> 17:34.126
I've been living here
about thirty-five years.

17:34.220 --> 17:38.589
I seen all kinda changes, but
nothing to compare to Katrina.

17:38.683 --> 17:39.844
Mm-mmm.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.926
She just came along and
blew everything away.

17:43.020 --> 17:47.435
We gets all kinda hurricanes
around these parts.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.563
But we ain't never seen
nothing like her before.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.189
Mm-mmm.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.147
Man, the Lord was angry.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.699
People was floating
along the streets.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.492
Dogs!

17:59.579 --> 18:01.741
Families standing
on rooftops

18:01.831 --> 18:04.323
crying cause they ain't
gots no home no more.

18:04.417 --> 18:09.082
My old man, he a booze hound,
he been on the ward for years.

18:09.171 --> 18:13.210
And my boy, Deon,
he in the pen.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.542
So me?

18:15.636 --> 18:17.547
I gots no one to help me.

18:17.638 --> 18:22.348
So I sank to my knees and
I asked the Lord to help me.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.927
The Lord come.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.058
Melvin.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.936
Melvin, that's what!

18:30.026 --> 18:33.940
He showed up when the
storm was raging and I was

18:34.030 --> 18:40.117
cowering in my kitchen like a
kicked dog, roof clean gone.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.159
And he led me
out to safety.

18:45.541 --> 18:51.503
Storm passed, sun came
out, wind died down.

18:51.589 --> 18:55.878
I come home,
my roof is on.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.634
How...

18:58.721 --> 19:01.804
How you gonna explain
shit like that?

19:56.779 --> 20:00.864
The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.408
And Kurtz's life was
running swiftly, too.

20:05.496 --> 20:09.205
And Kurtz's life was
running swiftly, too.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.077
Genius.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.412
As Conrad got older,
he wrote less.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.622
He eventually
settled in England.

20:17.717 --> 20:22.302
Didn't care much for public
scrutiny or adoration.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.722
Guess he just wanted to be out
in the country by himself.

20:27.017 --> 20:31.682
Like Conrad, mom was a
reclusive writer as well.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.513
Listen to this.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.944
The day broke
gray and dull.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.316
God!

20:41.407 --> 20:43.648
I mean, I wish I could come
up with shit like that.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.782
Instead, I look out the
window and I think, oh, fuck!

20:47.872 --> 20:49.237
It's raining.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.956
Here, there's something
else I wanna read you.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.960
Fuck off.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.170
One day, I was like
I guess maybe uh,

21:01.260 --> 21:02.466
it was right
before Katrina.

21:02.553 --> 21:03.964
Actually, it was a little
ways before Katrina.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.512
This fucking family shows up
in the neighborhood, right?

21:06.599 --> 21:09.466
And it's fucking Mel and
his mom and his fucking

21:09.560 --> 21:11.972
smoking hot sister.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.099
And this black guy
in a wheelchair,

21:14.190 --> 21:16.101
named fucking Lucille.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.059
And fucking Mel, he does
this weird ass trick,

21:19.153 --> 21:21.520
right, where he likes stacks
up these quarters, okay?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.525
And it's like just sitting
there still and all of a

21:23.616 --> 21:25.607
sudden he starts doing
this shit and the quarters

21:25.701 --> 21:26.987
start lifting up, right?

21:27.077 --> 21:28.784
And they start separating.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.579
And I was like, looking
at Lyle, we're both like,

21:31.665 --> 21:32.951
what the fuck, man?

21:33.042 --> 21:35.283
Now, we're just like
fucking boys, I mean.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.870
Lucille, Mel, Lucas, Lyle,
me, we're like family.

21:38.964 --> 21:39.999
You know what I mean?

21:40.090 --> 21:40.921
How much you got, Lyle?

21:41.008 --> 21:41.918
Eighty dollars.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.499
Shit, get as much
<i>as</i> you can get.

21:43.594 --> 21:44.584
Think I got
enough for that--

21:44.678 --> 21:45.543
- Quarter.
- Quarter?

21:45.638 --> 21:46.673
Alright, man.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.846
See if they'll
roll one up for me.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.516
I don't like rolling
mother fucker.

21:51.602 --> 21:54.594
These niggas ain't got
nothing better to do.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.517
You don't know
how to roll.

21:57.608 --> 21:58.473
Yo, what's up, Nate?

21:58.567 --> 21:59.648
You got some
weed for me, bro?

21:59.735 --> 22:00.896
You know it.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.977
Hey, holla at my man,
Ramone, right there.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.859
What's going on, bro?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.657
If it ain't
Black-man and Robin.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.108
What's happening?

22:11.413 --> 22:13.950
Sup, cuz?
Cat got your tongue?

22:14.041 --> 22:15.657
We ain't related, nigga.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.492
And don't be
calling your cuz.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.543
We might be related considering
I banged your momma.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.131
Big baller,
shot caller, huh?

22:23.217 --> 22:24.628
Hey, man, come on. Get
that little crippled

22:24.718 --> 22:26.880
mother fucker up out of
here talking that shit.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.426
You got it, dude.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.383
Well, get it the fuck up
out of here then, dude.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.806
Okay, man.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.728
This C-block, cuz.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.647
Nate, man, I
appreciate it brother.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.189
No doubt.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.564
I hate having to kiss that
mother fucker, Nathan's,

22:43.654 --> 22:45.770
ass just for a
couple joints.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.823
Ah, damn, man.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.527
Hey, who got shot?

22:52.621 --> 22:53.452
Remember that kid who used
to be dribbling around

22:53.539 --> 22:54.574
with that basketball.

22:54.665 --> 22:55.496
Yeah.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.119
Got wasted off a
crack rock, Luc.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.041
Dealed from that
mother fucker, Nathan.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.289
Shit, if I wasn't in this
mother fucking chair,

23:00.379 --> 23:02.370
I'd beat all the black
off that mother fucker.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.296
He'd be a Caucasian in
about five minutes.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.294
I'll tell you that
right now, shit.

23:31.702 --> 23:32.692
Feel that?

23:33.370 --> 23:34.326
Yeah.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.370
I can make you come
with my finger.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.869
Imagine what I could
do with my tongue.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.825
Hunny?

23:40.920 --> 23:41.910
Fuck off.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.085
What?

23:43.964 --> 23:45.921
Jesus, you're
a train wreck.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.139
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:55.225 --> 23:58.468
You mind giving the man
in the chair a shot?

23:58.562 --> 24:02.271
I am so sorry, honey,
but I have a man.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.082
What rap they get
you on, kid?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.050
I'm talking to you.

25:18.559 --> 25:19.469
What'd you do?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.517
Why'd you get
community service?

25:27.443 --> 25:29.400
I set my school on fire.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.566
Smoke weed?

25:39.788 --> 25:41.324
If life gets you down,

25:41.415 --> 25:43.452
it's not a bad
thing to try.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.499
Always helped me.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.750
Here.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.076
Sunny, Florida.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.995
Rex is still a baby there.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.823
He won't even
remember that one.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.999
First day at school.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.579
Notice, how the mother
isn't featured.

26:30.672 --> 26:34.666
My old man he split when
uh, when I was just a kid.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.717
I'm not about to let
that happen to Rex.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.160
Fuck you.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.136
Care for a mint?

28:02.890 --> 28:04.676
Give me that
mother fucker.

28:06.977 --> 28:08.183
You look a little
peaky, Mel.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.011
No, I'm just tired, dude.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.062
Really?

28:12.149 --> 28:13.184
Oh, here we go.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.686
You're trying to
scare me now, huh?

28:14.776 --> 28:15.732
I'm just saying is all.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.230
You look like you
could use rest.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.857
Right, but I'm charting
okay though, right?

28:18.947 --> 28:20.904
It's not what they're saying,
it's what I'm saying.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.989
You know, one day, it
won't hurt if you saw

28:26.079 --> 28:28.116
professional help cause I
really don't have a clue

28:28.207 --> 28:29.197
what I'm looking for.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.201
No doctors, buddy.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.782
You know that.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.959
Yeah, they're people out there
that know a lot more than me.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.003
I'm a science teacher
in a local college.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.875
Doesn't make me any
great authority.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.253
God handing out
all the gifts.

28:43.347 --> 28:46.556
I'm stuck in
this damn chair.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.132
Yeah, but you got me.

28:49.478 --> 28:52.140
That ain't no damn
consolation prize.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.476
So, we done here or what?

28:55.567 --> 28:56.307
Yeah.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.646
- Sweet.
- Lucas.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.690
Let me get a couple of
those pills you gave me

29:00.781 --> 29:01.942
last time for the pain.

29:02.032 --> 29:02.988
No, Lu.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.565
- Mel.
- Hey, hey.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.406
Hey, you.

29:07.496 --> 29:08.986
Lucas, you got two of
these. Can I have one?

29:09.081 --> 29:11.823
Give a nigga a lab coat
and he think he a doctor.

29:11.917 --> 29:12.952
He's getting pissed.

29:13.043 --> 29:13.703
- Alright.
- You ain't gonna get your--

29:13.752 --> 29:14.537
Thank you, doc.

29:14.628 --> 29:15.709
Take care of
yourself, okay?

29:15.796 --> 29:17.082
Yeah, I'm good, man.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.458
Chill.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.877
Ten across with the
A in the middle.

29:31.311 --> 29:32.972
Annihilation.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.646
Mother fucker.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.315
How you know that shit?

29:38.402 --> 29:39.892
Oh, just a guess.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.024
What's next?

29:42.114 --> 29:44.947
Alright, seven down when
the same A in the middle.

29:48.829 --> 29:49.739
Anomaly.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.537
- Anoma, what?
- Anomaly!

29:51.623 --> 29:54.206
It's like a
one-off, like me.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.203
Man, you ain't no one-off.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.786
You a circus freak.

29:57.879 --> 30:00.416
That's funny
coming from you.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.747
Yeah, I got put here.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.458
Yeah, you think I chose?

30:05.012 --> 30:06.844
Man, you ain't got
nothing but choices.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.887
All you choose to do is
smoke weed and chase cat.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.433
Whoa!

30:13.520 --> 30:14.601
Jimmy!

30:15.522 --> 30:17.229
What up, Jimmy?

30:20.527 --> 30:21.767
Hey, what it look like?

30:21.862 --> 30:24.103
You get a haircut?

30:24.197 --> 30:26.484
Look at him. Cleaner than
the board of health.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.614
Butch. Sundance.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.070
We ain't doing
that, Jimmy.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.530
We just chilling.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.080
Mm-hmm.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.498
Come on, Melvin.
Put it out.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.295
Show a little respect
for Christ's sakes.

30:41.381 --> 30:42.166
It's a joint, man.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.252
- I mean--
- I see that.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.708
Here, man.

30:45.802 --> 30:46.758
Thank you, Lucille.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.927
Not a problem.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.801
You know what kills me?

30:51.892 --> 30:53.678
Smoking?

30:53.769 --> 30:55.225
No.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.599
What kills me is that
you're out here every day

30:57.689 --> 30:58.850
doing the same thing.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.181
Getting high, drinking
beers like there's no

31:01.276 --> 31:04.109
tomorrow with Cool
Runnings over here.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.277
That shit ain't funny.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.024
That was funny.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.108
That shit ain't funny.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.189
When what you could
be doing is taking

31:08.283 --> 31:10.900
responsibility amongst
your community.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.911
I've seen the things
you can do, Melvin.

31:14.998 --> 31:15.908
It's no secret
around here.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.036
You got a gift.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.208
But you're wasting it.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.411
You ever thought
about helping out?

31:22.506 --> 31:23.746
You know?

31:23.840 --> 31:27.333
Hell, maybe create a nicer
environment for your son

31:27.427 --> 31:29.088
to grow up in.

31:29.179 --> 31:31.261
There's something
to think about.

31:31.348 --> 31:32.133
What is this?

31:32.224 --> 31:33.134
Huh?

31:33.225 --> 31:34.886
National pick on
Melvin day, Jimmy?

31:34.976 --> 31:38.310
No, it's national get your
shit together day and I

31:38.397 --> 31:41.105
say that because I care.

31:41.191 --> 31:42.898
Tell that mother fucker
again cause son of a bitch

31:42.984 --> 31:44.065
don't listen to me.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.359
And don't be calling
me Cool Runnings.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.275
I'm on it, Jimmy,
alright? I'm on it.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.323
Yeah, on what?

31:51.410 --> 31:53.742
Since Amelia?

31:53.829 --> 31:57.038
I'm gonna work
on it, okay?

31:57.124 --> 31:58.034
You got my word. I...

31:58.125 --> 31:59.035
Give me some time, alright?

31:59.126 --> 32:01.083
I'll get my
shit together.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.830
Oxycodone.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.291
Semi-synthetic, slow
release painkiller first

32:08.385 --> 32:10.422
synthesized by eminent
pharmacologists,

32:10.512 --> 32:14.801
Freund and Speyer,
in Germany in 1916.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.006
I'm a fan.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.512
Now, I'm gonna show you
some crimes scenes.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.843
Third story up, I knew these
guys were robbing the place.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.770
Their car was sitting
here, engine running.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.975
These two knuckleheads jump
down, they jam into their car.

32:25.068 --> 32:25.933
They spot me.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.392
One guy comes
at me, crack!

32:27.487 --> 32:28.693
I put him over the head.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.068
Next guy, starts waving
some screwdriver at me.

32:32.159 --> 32:32.944
Relieved him of that.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.775
Put him down.
Done.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.453
All units, we got a 211 in
progress on Atlantic Boulevard.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.076
Get them, Lyle.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.787
Come on, man.
Let's move!

32:47.466 --> 32:49.298
The old Vicodin.

32:49.384 --> 32:52.467
Heavy, opiate narcotic
to treat severe pain.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.591
It's the most widely
prescribed prescription

32:54.681 --> 32:56.388
medication in
this country.

32:56.475 --> 33:01.515
Over 140 million prescriptions
of this drug alone.

33:01.605 --> 33:04.222
And I'm proud to say that
I'm not one of those people.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.101
Why?

33:05.150 --> 33:07.107
Because I steal mine.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.728
Woo!

33:10.822 --> 33:12.779
Come on, Lyle!

33:13.742 --> 33:16.951
I chase down the guys the cops
don't have time to deal with.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.950
Junkies, small
time criminals.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.405
You gotta be careful.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.117
A desperate man can
be a dangerous man.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.747
These guys?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.794
Fucking amateurs.

33:38.475 --> 33:41.763
Fucking robbed the store for
sixty some odd dollars.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.184
What is wrong
with these people?

33:43.271 --> 33:45.262
Yeah, they're crooks,
but they have a bit of

33:45.357 --> 33:46.893
initiative
they're showing.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.189
And I like that, because
they're not just sitting

33:48.276 --> 33:50.483
around waiting for a
fucking handout, you know?

33:50.570 --> 33:52.026
That's the problem
with the country.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.400
You gotta bunch of lazy
mother fuckers sitting on

33:54.491 --> 33:56.732
their fat asses with a
begging bowl in one hand

33:56.826 --> 33:58.191
and McDonald's
in the other.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.243
Yeah, they're criminals,
but at least they're trying.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.168
<i>Woo-hoe'.!</i>

34:13.260 --> 34:14.250
Yee-ha!

34:15.637 --> 34:16.377
What?

34:17.639 --> 34:21.098
I was ready to love the
whole fucking world.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.094
Rawr!

34:22.185 --> 34:23.596
But no one understood me!

34:23.687 --> 34:24.597
Nobody!

34:24.688 --> 34:26.895
So I learned to hate.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.563
You think I'm the one
to set things straight?

34:28.650 --> 34:29.560
Look at me, man.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.187
Wrong.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.987
Ah, fuck.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.188
No, no, no.

34:37.284 --> 34:40.197
Talented and
astute, but lazy.

34:41.496 --> 34:45.706
Likely to understand everything
and even accomplish something.

34:45.792 --> 34:51.958
He had nonetheless been content
to enjoy life as a spectator.

34:52.047 --> 34:56.667
Maupassant, I
dig you, man.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.593
I dig you!

35:13.069 --> 35:14.480
Get off!

36:34.401 --> 36:35.311
Oh my god!

36:35.402 --> 36:36.733
Mom, look.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.812
Oh my god!

36:39.906 --> 36:41.396
What happened?

36:41.491 --> 36:42.322
You okay?

36:42.409 --> 36:44.366
I was out, or what?

36:45.954 --> 36:48.116
Yeah, you were out.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.571
Let me go get somebody.

36:52.669 --> 36:53.830
Hey, man.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.955
Hey, mom.

36:56.047 --> 36:56.912
How you doing?

36:57.006 --> 36:59.088
You're gonna be okay.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.343
What happened?

37:03.430 --> 37:04.636
Ah, let me see.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.135
Melvin was being Melvin.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.512
Melvin can do anything.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.559
Melvin think he can fly.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.638
Melvin think he can drink
a whole liquor store.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.895
Melvin jump off cliff.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.942
Hurt when hit ground.

37:20.113 --> 37:22.229
That's pretty much
what happened, man.

37:23.032 --> 37:23.692
- Hi.
- How you doing?

37:23.742 --> 37:24.698
Hi, how are you feeling?

37:24.784 --> 37:26.195
You just woke up?

37:26.286 --> 37:27.151
Yeah, what is this thing?

37:27.245 --> 37:28.827
This just checks
your heart rate.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.245
You went into cardiac
arrest so we're just

37:31.332 --> 37:32.663
monitoring you right now.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.082
You gonna be
his nurse today?

37:34.169 --> 37:35.000
Yes, sir.

37:35.086 --> 37:35.917
Can you be my
nurse tomorrow?

37:36.004 --> 37:36.618
Sure.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.502
Alright.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.704
That's what I'm
talking about.

37:38.798 --> 37:45.090
I got a little pain down
below and you know,

37:45.180 --> 37:46.511
he's been dead for a while.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.714
I was wondering if you could
bring him back to life,

37:48.808 --> 37:50.845
you know, a little
mouth to mouth

37:50.935 --> 37:53.267
resuscitation would
help me right now.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.264
Stop, don't
listen to that.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.470
We apologize for him.

37:55.565 --> 37:56.305
That's okay.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.392
We get that all the time.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.316
I was just having
fun with you, girl.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.393
Just being serious.

38:08.077 --> 38:11.445
Sir, is your full
name Melvin Hesper?

38:11.539 --> 38:14.702
That's me doc,
but call me Mel.

38:14.793 --> 38:18.331
We cannot seem to find any
medical records on you.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.753
Any type of history?

38:20.840 --> 38:22.501
I never go to
the hospitals.

38:22.592 --> 38:23.798
Never?

38:23.885 --> 38:26.923
Never broke a bone,
a bad flu, anything?

38:28.473 --> 38:29.804
What about medical
insurance?

38:29.891 --> 38:31.222
Are you covered?

38:31.309 --> 38:34.427
Why would I be covered if
I don't go to a hospital?

38:36.314 --> 38:38.430
These scars, they look
like gunshot wounds.

38:38.525 --> 38:40.266
What can you tell
me about them?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.771
They're gunshot wounds.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.067
That's very funny.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.770
How did you get them?

38:46.032 --> 38:47.568
<i>A gun.</i>

38:49.786 --> 38:51.072
Tell me about this one.

38:52.205 --> 38:53.570
Oh, this?
It's nothing.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.623
Just some cap stuck
me a few years back.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.325
You didn't get
medical help?

38:59.045 --> 39:02.413
I don't have
insurance, doc.

39:02.507 --> 39:07.843
Sir, you just suffered a
serious cardiac arrest.

39:07.929 --> 39:11.923
Your heart stopped beating
for several minutes.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.802
You were certified dead.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.261
Look, we're gonna need to
keep you under observation

39:18.356 --> 39:20.313
for at least
forty-eight hours.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.688
Our preliminary tests
produced some particularly

39:23.778 --> 39:27.646
interesting results that
may be personal to you.

39:50.013 --> 39:54.598
Lying there in the hospital,
I realized something.

39:54.684 --> 39:56.516
I got it all wrong.

39:56.603 --> 39:58.640
I've been a total asshole.

40:01.524 --> 40:02.935
You on some kind of
narcotic, nigger?

40:03.026 --> 40:05.984
No, I'm being serious.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.185
I got a gift here, man.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.612
I gotta start using it.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.690
Use it for the good.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.525
I'm gonna change.

40:13.620 --> 40:16.157
I'm gonna start fighting
crime, not committing it.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.612
I've been saying
that shit for years.

40:17.707 --> 40:20.119
Yeah, I know. Well, I wasn't
ready to listen, okay?

40:20.209 --> 40:22.246
But lying there with my
whole life flashing in

40:22.337 --> 40:25.170
front of me,
it came to me.

40:26.382 --> 40:29.340
I'm gonna do whatever
it takes for Rex.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.963
No more drinking.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.045
No more weed, pills.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.130
I'm even gonna
stop cigarettes.

40:35.224 --> 40:38.933
Pussy, cheating,
hustling, stealing.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.681
I'm even thinking about
stopping jerking off.

40:40.772 --> 40:41.853
Yeah, I wouldn't
go that far.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.022
No--

40:44.108 --> 40:44.973
Maybe that's a
bit too much.

40:45.068 --> 40:47.526
Yeah, that's too much. Shit.

40:47.612 --> 40:52.607
From this day forward, I'm
going straight, brother.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.656
I am.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.444
Well, alright.

40:57.538 --> 41:00.576
I'll tell you what,
I'm with you, Melvin.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.877
Melvin, this is
your calling.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.796
What you got is a gift.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.748
It's from the heavens.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.708
So is Rex, brother.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.259
So is Rex.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.112
Fuck.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.249
It's okay.

42:02.729 --> 42:05.312
He got the plan
inside his hand.

42:05.398 --> 42:07.810
Understand that
he's the man.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.107
Each and every time
abide the sign.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.980
Press the rewind
in your own mind.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.232
Kick it one more time.

42:13.322 --> 42:16.235
Hey, Mel. Can you bend
his mouth to shut up?

42:18.953 --> 42:19.784
Uh!

42:25.460 --> 42:27.701
See he got the master
plan inside his hand.

42:27.795 --> 42:29.786
Understand that he's
the man, got the plan.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.371
Surprise.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.216
You gotta be kidding me.

42:35.303 --> 42:36.338
Drink it.

42:36.429 --> 42:37.760
It's robiatic.

42:37.847 --> 42:39.963
It's what?

42:40.058 --> 42:41.674
Healthy.

42:41.768 --> 42:43.133
You mean macrobiotic.

42:43.227 --> 42:43.967
Whatever, man.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.010
Just drink the shit.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.139
It's good for you.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.267
I can't drink
this shit man.

42:52.361 --> 42:54.898
I'll start voting Green
Peace and dating guys.

42:57.533 --> 42:58.739
Alright.

43:00.745 --> 43:01.826
It's good.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.620
You know, I read this
book about health.

43:03.706 --> 43:05.367
I put some
celery in there.

43:05.458 --> 43:08.792
They said to clean out the
lungs, you know, reduces mucus.

43:08.878 --> 43:10.494
And you'll spit all that
tarred-nicotine from them

43:10.588 --> 43:11.919
cigarettes out.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.713
And then I put some ginger
in there that'll clean out

43:13.800 --> 43:15.131
the blood stream.

43:15.218 --> 43:17.755
Help get all that alcohol
and whatever else you been

43:17.845 --> 43:19.335
putting up your damn nose.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.967
And uh, you
gonna piss a lot.

43:22.058 --> 43:23.423
- Just understand that.
- Mm-hmm.

43:23.518 --> 43:24.758
But that's a good thing.

43:24.852 --> 43:26.388
I taste the ginger.

43:26.479 --> 43:28.140
Yeah, it got a
little heat on it.

43:28.231 --> 43:30.268
I put some rhubarb
in there, too.

43:30.358 --> 43:31.063
Rhubarb?

43:31.109 --> 43:32.440
Rhubarb.

43:32.527 --> 43:33.733
- Yeah.
- What the hell is rhubarb?

43:33.820 --> 43:34.810
It clears the mind.

43:34.904 --> 43:35.689
<i>R's a root.</i>

43:35.738 --> 43:36.853
Oh, I know.
Yeah, yeah.

43:36.948 --> 43:38.655
I ain't put no voodoo
or nothing on this.

43:38.741 --> 43:39.902
It's just to
clean you out.

43:39.992 --> 43:40.777
Yeah!

43:40.827 --> 43:41.988
One more, one more.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.903
Come on, champ.

43:44.997 --> 43:47.489
I care about you, brother.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.494
I wanna see
you get better.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.167
I wanna see you do better.

43:53.548 --> 43:55.505
Thanks, buddy.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.551
We was fourteen?

43:59.637 --> 44:01.298
We was twelve actually.

44:01.389 --> 44:03.005
Yeah, just about
to turn thirteen.

44:03.099 --> 44:06.637
We met in uh, California.

44:06.727 --> 44:09.059
I hadn't seen my boy
for some years and

44:09.147 --> 44:12.105
then I come back, and he's
able to do all this stuff

44:12.191 --> 44:14.398
like, you know, make
spoons move across the

44:14.485 --> 44:16.067
table and shit like that.

44:16.154 --> 44:17.360
You know.

44:17.446 --> 44:18.561
Black people don't
usually, you know, get

44:18.656 --> 44:20.397
along with that kinda
stuff, you know.

44:20.491 --> 44:21.731
That's why you don't see
a lot of black people at

44:21.826 --> 44:23.066
magician shows, you know.

44:23.161 --> 44:25.027
Cause they think it's like
voodoo and the devil.

44:31.586 --> 44:34.169
Yeah, I remember I called you
and I was like, where's Lucille?

44:34.255 --> 44:38.544
And I asked your morn, and
she said, Melvin, he's gone.

44:38.634 --> 44:39.465
He's in the military.

44:39.552 --> 44:40.713
I said, what'?
What the fuck?

44:40.803 --> 44:42.544
Slap him.
Slap him.

44:43.097 --> 44:46.431
Two peas and a biscuit.

44:50.646 --> 44:51.636
Hit that mother fucker.

44:51.731 --> 44:53.142
Drop the bitch.

44:53.232 --> 44:58.318
I left dodging bullets and
ending up dodging more bullets.

44:58.404 --> 45:00.236
And one of them got me.

45:14.587 --> 45:16.578
You have no idea what's
in that box of yours

45:16.672 --> 45:17.912
do you, mother fucker?

45:18.007 --> 45:18.792
That's what I'm
talking about.

45:18.883 --> 45:19.793
Muscle memory.

45:19.884 --> 45:21.340
Like riding a bike.

45:21.427 --> 45:23.714
You don't know what your made
of til you test that heart.

45:23.804 --> 45:24.919
Go on, put it to the test.

45:25.014 --> 45:27.506
What he can do around
these neighborhoods,

45:27.600 --> 45:30.718
around the world, around the
country with that gift,

45:30.811 --> 45:33.018
could fix a whole
lot of shit.

45:42.073 --> 45:42.733
What the fuck!

45:42.782 --> 45:43.647
Sorry!

45:43.741 --> 45:44.731
What the hell
just happened?

45:44.825 --> 45:45.906
He)', pipe down.

45:45.993 --> 45:48.109
We're training over
here, mother fucker.

45:48.204 --> 45:49.160
Fuck.

45:49.247 --> 45:50.908
I knew he was
paralyzed, you know.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.238
I mean, he told me that.

45:52.333 --> 45:53.664
And you know, I didn't
quite know how I was gonna

45:53.751 --> 45:55.662
handle it, but my main
thing was I was gonna

45:55.753 --> 45:57.494
treat him as I
always treated him.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.545
As my equal, as my friend,
and as my brother.

46:04.929 --> 46:05.919
Fuck.

46:06.013 --> 46:08.129
Lucille, this is some
heavy shit, man.

46:08.224 --> 46:09.589
Five more.

46:09.684 --> 46:11.470
- It's that green juice, man.
- Ah, it's something else.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.766
That shit taste nasty,
but it's doing something.

46:12.853 --> 46:13.718
It's something else, man.
It's something else.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.349
It's running
through my blood.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.804
It's a new energy.

46:16.899 --> 46:17.889
I don't know what it is.

46:17.984 --> 46:19.190
It's scary, man.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.267
Don't be scared of it.

46:20.361 --> 46:21.271
Let it flow.

46:40.172 --> 46:42.129
You doing this
shit again, ain't you?

46:42.550 --> 46:44.291
See? He can do
anything, man.

46:44.385 --> 46:45.375
Anything.

46:45.469 --> 46:46.379
That's what I'm
talking about, Melvin.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.507
You getting back
to yourself.

46:48.597 --> 46:51.430
Look like you did when you
was in your twenties, huh?

46:51.517 --> 46:53.099
That's right.

46:55.021 --> 46:57.137
Stop showing off,
mother fucker.

47:04.697 --> 47:06.062
Are you sure this
is the block, or?

47:06.157 --> 47:08.649
Yeah, man. She come
this way all the time.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.072
Wait til you see her.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.324
Mm!

47:19.295 --> 47:21.002
What?

47:21.088 --> 47:21.793
I'm just looking at you.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.580
Is that a problem?

47:23.674 --> 47:25.210
You looking at me like
you don't believe me.

47:25.301 --> 47:26.917
Of course I believe you.

47:28.137 --> 47:31.425
You said you see her every
day, she's obviously late.

47:31.515 --> 47:33.131
Just give it a
little time, man.

47:33.225 --> 47:34.807
Give it a little time.

47:34.894 --> 47:36.510
Something that fine
need a little time.

47:36.604 --> 47:38.595
It's like wine.

47:39.690 --> 47:42.773
You know, we could just
come back another day, too.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.817
It's no big deal.

47:51.243 --> 47:52.825
Damn.

47:53.621 --> 47:55.783
I really thought I had a
shot with this one, man.

47:55.873 --> 47:58.035
You may, Luc.
Come on.

47:58.125 --> 47:58.830
<i>Maybe she's sick.</i>

47:58.876 --> 48:00.366
She's at home. She...

48:00.461 --> 48:01.371
You'll find her.

48:01.462 --> 48:02.452
Eh, man, fuck it,
man. Come on.

48:02.546 --> 48:03.536
- Let's go.
- Really?

48:03.631 --> 48:04.462
- Yeah, man. Fuck it.

48:04.548 --> 48:05.413
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

48:05.508 --> 48:06.964
- What?
- There she is.

48:07.051 --> 48:07.961
Oh, fuck.

48:08.052 --> 48:09.338
Which one is she?

48:09.428 --> 48:12.716
The one that don't look
like a water buffalo.

48:12.807 --> 48:13.638
Stop laughing, man.

48:13.724 --> 48:14.384
They looking.
They looking.

48:14.433 --> 48:15.093
Yup.

48:15.142 --> 48:16.303
Chill. Chill.

48:16.394 --> 48:17.884
Hey, ladies,
what's cracking?

48:17.978 --> 48:19.514
What you doing?

48:19.605 --> 48:20.891
Just chilling, baby.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.146
What's your
name, baby girl?

48:23.234 --> 48:25.692
Yolanda.

48:25.778 --> 48:26.768
I like that.

48:26.862 --> 48:27.602
Thank you.

48:27.655 --> 48:29.191
Tell you what, Yolanda.

48:29.281 --> 48:31.238
If I could impress you, would
you let me call you one time?

48:34.412 --> 48:35.902
You gonna impress me?

48:37.498 --> 48:38.784
Knock yourself out.

48:46.132 --> 48:47.293
Uh-huh.

48:48.092 --> 48:51.084
How the hell you do that?

48:51.178 --> 48:54.387
Walking is the only
thing I can't do, baby.

48:54.473 --> 48:55.884
You feel me?

48:57.017 --> 48:58.724
It's uh, 717...

48:58.811 --> 48:59.892
I'm listening.

48:59.979 --> 49:00.969
21...

49:01.063 --> 49:01.723
Uh-huh.

49:01.772 --> 49:02.682
82.

49:02.773 --> 49:04.684
That's what I'm
talking about.

49:05.818 --> 49:07.024
Bye.

49:07.111 --> 49:09.193
I just love
watching you walk.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.190
Stop.

49:10.281 --> 49:11.771
You look good
coming and going.

49:11.866 --> 49:12.981
Thank you.

49:13.075 --> 49:14.065
Mm!

49:16.078 --> 49:17.409
Did you get the
number, man?

49:19.206 --> 49:21.243
I knew your ass was good for
something, mother fucker.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.664
She is beautiful, Luc.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.207
I wasn't bullshitting, was it?

49:24.295 --> 49:25.785
Hell no.
She's fine.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.121
Man, I'll tell you, I'll wait
out here fifteen hours for that.

49:28.215 --> 49:29.376
Shit, she just
looked back.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.252
Don't look.
Don't look.

49:30.342 --> 49:31.753
- Alright.
- Just be cool.

49:31.844 --> 49:33.585
We should just
peel out of here.

49:33.679 --> 49:35.511
Yeah, she's looking
all the way.

49:35.598 --> 49:37.088
Don't look anxious, right?

49:37.183 --> 49:38.389
No, no, no. We gonna
go the opposite way.

49:38.476 --> 49:39.386
We can't be, you know...

49:39.477 --> 49:40.808
Alright, I'm in
there then, shit.

49:40.895 --> 49:41.726
- You see that ass?
- Like Donkey Kong.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.519
Like a mother fucker.

49:43.606 --> 49:47.224
Shit, I'ma put her
ass in a wheelchair.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.275
Shit.

49:51.697 --> 49:53.654
Two years? Jesus.

49:55.034 --> 49:56.490

49:56.577 --> 49:57.487
Where's the man?

49:57.578 --> 49:58.409

- Yo, he's inside.

49:58.496 --> 49:59.986
Let me go get

50:00.080 --> 50:01.366
- Danny.
- Yeah?

50:02.416 --> 50:03.622
The boys are here.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.291
Oh, shit.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.248
<i>Danny DOV'-!</i>

50:08.339 --> 50:09.670

50:11.967 --> 50:13.503
- Welcome home, man.
- Good to see you, brother.

50:13.594 --> 50:14.709
- Come here, man.
- What's up, brother?

50:14.803 --> 50:16.293
God damn.

50:16.388 --> 50:17.753
Ain't nobody tamper
with you, did they?

50:17.848 --> 50:19.009
No, no, no.

50:19.099 --> 50:20.089
Shit.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.425
- Mel?
- I'm good. Taking the night off.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.976
Ah, don't be a pussy,
man. Let's drink.

50:24.063 --> 50:25.349
Yeah, man. He just
got out of the joint.

50:25.439 --> 50:26.895
Hey, the mother
fucker's in training.

50:26.982 --> 50:29.064
Won't you two just
chill the fuck out?

50:30.819 --> 50:32.605
Just trying to
make some changes.

50:32.696 --> 50:33.936
What'? It's my first
night back, man.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.772
I thought we was
gonna roll all night.

50:36.659 --> 50:37.774
We are, man.
I'm hanging!

50:37.868 --> 50:39.074
You're hanging.

50:39.161 --> 50:40.947
What the fuck you talking
about, hanging, man?

50:41.038 --> 50:42.073
I've been away two years.

50:42.164 --> 50:44.576
You're gonna hang
my first night back?

50:45.459 --> 50:49.043
Man, the brother is getting
his life together for Rex.

50:51.465 --> 50:52.421
No, shit.

50:52.508 --> 50:53.464
Yeah, man.

50:59.014 --> 51:01.051
You doing it for your boy?

51:01.141 --> 51:02.131
I am.

51:02.226 --> 51:03.808
Good on you then, brother.

51:03.894 --> 51:05.726
I'm proud of you.

51:05.813 --> 51:06.894
You're a good man, Mel.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.016
Yeah.

51:08.107 --> 51:10.769
I, however, am not
a fucking good man.

51:10.859 --> 51:12.520
And if I wake
up alive tomorrow,

51:12.611 --> 51:14.443
I'm gonna consider this night
a mother fucking waste.

51:14.530 --> 51:15.861
Hey, hey, he)'-

51:15.948 --> 51:17.438
I probably won't remember
none of this shit anyway.

51:17.533 --> 51:19.023
He never remembers shit.

51:19.118 --> 51:20.028
Don't take too long, guys.

51:20.119 --> 51:21.325
- Come on up.
- I gotta try, man.

51:21.412 --> 51:22.493
That's all.

51:22.580 --> 51:23.615
<i>L</i> gotta 'IVY-

51:23.706 --> 51:25.196
It's fucking good
to see you, brother.

51:25.291 --> 51:26.201
You too.

51:26.292 --> 51:27.453
Good to see you, too, Luc.

51:27.543 --> 51:28.624
Hell yeah, that's good.

51:28.711 --> 51:30.293
Let's get to seeing
some ass right here.

51:30.379 --> 51:31.244
You see that right there?

51:31.338 --> 51:32.624
That's what's good to see.

51:32.715 --> 51:34.672
Time to ride.

52:37.237 --> 52:38.398
Hey, what up, homie?

52:38.489 --> 52:40.105
Hey, holla at your boy.

52:40.199 --> 52:41.815

52:48.916 --> 52:49.826
Alright, man.

52:50.459 --> 52:52.120
Stay out of trouble, man.

53:05.766 --> 53:07.052
You know what this is?

53:07.935 --> 53:10.017
I don't know.
You tell me.

53:10.104 --> 53:11.560
It's sober hand.

53:12.940 --> 53:14.055
Okay.

53:16.402 --> 53:17.608
I'm sober.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.396
When I was in the hospital,
I did a lot of thinking.

53:21.490 --> 53:23.276
All the things
you were saying.

53:23.367 --> 53:27.156
Lucille's been
telling me for years.

53:27.246 --> 53:28.327
And I'm ready.

53:29.498 --> 53:31.614
I'm ready to do some
good in this community.

53:33.335 --> 53:34.917
Is that why you show up to
crime scenes and relieve

53:35.003 --> 53:37.290
the suspects of
their stolen goods?

53:37.381 --> 53:38.166
Come on, man.

53:38.257 --> 53:39.088
That was then,
this is now.

53:39.174 --> 53:40.664
I've been through
something.

53:40.759 --> 53:41.999
No fucking around.

53:42.094 --> 53:43.676
I wanna help you.

53:43.762 --> 53:45.548
Really?

53:45.639 --> 53:47.471
Ready to take on
that responsibility?

53:47.558 --> 53:49.799
Yes.

53:49.893 --> 53:51.349
Tell me what you
want me to do.

53:53.689 --> 53:56.397
I always knew you'd
be the one, Melvin.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.315
Your natural abilities,
the shit you can do.

53:58.402 --> 53:59.233
I've known you for years.

53:59.319 --> 54:01.276
It's still amazing.

54:03.031 --> 54:05.022
Hey, what's up, bitches?

54:15.711 --> 54:18.703
That's the shit I'm dealing
with every god damn day.

54:19.506 --> 54:21.622
You know that mother
fucker peddles rock and

54:21.717 --> 54:24.755
smack to kids not much
older than your son.

54:24.845 --> 54:26.131
Yeah, I know.

54:27.681 --> 54:29.968
That's why I'm here.

54:31.185 --> 54:33.142
Thanks, Jimmy.

54:34.104 --> 54:36.015
Thanks for believing
in me, buddy.

54:41.028 --> 54:42.393
Be careful with Nathan.

54:42.488 --> 54:44.399
He's a dangerous
mother fucker, man.

54:50.037 --> 54:51.152
Alright.

54:54.583 --> 54:56.915
- You ready?
- Yeah, I got this.

55:03.342 --> 55:04.298
Melvin.

55:04.384 --> 55:06.170
Shit.

55:06.261 --> 55:07.376
I'm sorry, man.

55:07.471 --> 55:11.009
You are not as ready
<i>as</i> you think you are.

55:23.237 --> 55:24.272
What the hell
you doing here?

55:24.363 --> 55:26.070
What you want?

55:26.156 --> 55:27.487
Where's Nathan at?

55:28.784 --> 55:30.195
Man, you know you don't
belong around here

55:30.285 --> 55:31.366
so take your ass home.

55:31.453 --> 55:33.410
Get Nathan down here now.

55:35.791 --> 55:36.496
Say what, now?

55:36.542 --> 55:37.828
So you giving me orders?

55:38.585 --> 55:40.246
Man, get the fuck out of
here before you get hurt.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.294
I'm not moving.

55:43.048 --> 55:44.004
Maybe this'll help you.

55:44.091 --> 55:44.876
Oh yeah?
Go for it.

55:44.967 --> 55:46.298
Make your move.

55:48.011 --> 55:49.593
Make your fucking move.

55:56.603 --> 55:57.513
O00!

55:58.105 --> 55:59.186
What you got?

55:59.273 --> 56:00.479
You got a piece
back there?

56:00.566 --> 56:01.681
Bring it.

56:01.775 --> 56:03.015
Man, how the
fuck you do that?

56:03.110 --> 56:04.600
You tell Nathan
I wanna see him.

56:04.695 --> 56:06.561
Anytime, anywhere.

56:07.239 --> 56:10.652
Bunch of fucking
pussies, hurting kids.

56:21.211 --> 56:24.420
This is just a small
way of saying welcome

56:24.506 --> 56:26.167
to our home, Ryan.

56:26.258 --> 56:28.920
It's Melvin's
favorite cake.

56:29.011 --> 56:31.719
I'm really thrilled that
he has decided to make

56:31.805 --> 56:33.011
certain positive changes.

56:33.098 --> 56:34.179
Come on, mom. Please?

56:34.266 --> 56:35.756
- Well, I am.
- Mom, that is embarrassing.

56:35.851 --> 56:37.012
Stop.

56:37.102 --> 56:38.718
Thank you so much for
welcoming me into your

56:38.812 --> 56:40.428
lovely home, Miss Hesper.

56:41.773 --> 56:45.107
Melvin, would you like
to personally greet Ry?

56:45.193 --> 56:46.649
Oh, love to.

56:46.737 --> 56:49.024
You hurt my sister, I'm gonna
break your fucking jaw.

56:49.114 --> 56:49.899
Melvin, language.

56:49.948 --> 56:50.858
Oh my god!

56:50.949 --> 56:52.189
Eh, I'm just
kidding you, buddy.

56:52.284 --> 56:54.116
Sorry, Ryan, let me just
apologize for my mentally

56:54.202 --> 56:56.819
handicapped brother
who's a total dick.

56:56.914 --> 56:57.699
Ryan.

56:57.789 --> 56:59.996
How hungry are
you feeling?

57:00.083 --> 57:01.073
It certainly
looks delicious.

57:01.168 --> 57:02.329
I'll take a
healthy size piece.

57:02.419 --> 57:03.534
Thank you very much.

57:03.629 --> 57:05.870
Well, you do have
lovely manners.

57:05.964 --> 57:08.171
I appreciate a young man
who knows how to say

57:08.258 --> 57:10.090
please and thank you.

57:10.177 --> 57:12.168
And where's your
delightful accent from?

57:12.262 --> 57:14.720
I'm originally from
Oklahoma, Miss Hesper.

57:14.806 --> 57:16.046
Well, please
call me Eileen.

57:16.141 --> 57:17.552
- I insist.
- Stop it.

57:17.643 --> 57:20.385
No, me and the kids father,
we went up to Oklahoma once.

57:20.479 --> 57:22.015
- It was--
- What the hell is going on?

57:22.105 --> 57:23.220
- Seriously, can you stop?
- Melvin.

57:23.315 --> 57:25.477
And we were in this
like yellow Cadillac.

57:25.567 --> 57:27.979
And it was just
so much fun.

57:28.070 --> 57:30.107
What the fuck!

57:30.197 --> 57:31.403
Ryan, language please.

57:31.490 --> 57:33.072
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Melvin.

57:33.158 --> 57:34.398
- Stop showing off.
- I have to go.

57:34.493 --> 57:35.324
Wow, great.

57:35.410 --> 57:36.616
Thank you.
Thanks, Melvin.

57:36.703 --> 57:38.785
I swear to god, you
are such a penis!

57:38.872 --> 57:39.782
What?

57:39.873 --> 57:41.363
I thought that
went rather well.

57:41.458 --> 57:42.198
I liked him.

57:42.250 --> 57:43.740
She liked him.

57:44.503 --> 57:45.538
I'm playing around, mom.

57:45.629 --> 57:46.710
<i>Jesus.</i>

57:46.797 --> 57:48.253
One evening where we could

57:48.340 --> 57:50.627
just sit as a family and have
a nice little piece of cake.

57:50.717 --> 57:52.253
Oh, come on.
I'm just...

57:52.344 --> 57:53.425
Fuck.

58:02.729 --> 58:04.686
Hey, man. Where the fuck
are you going now?

58:04.773 --> 58:06.059
It's Lucille.

58:07.234 --> 58:08.099
What is he?

58:08.193 --> 58:09.024
I don't know.

58:09.111 --> 58:11.068
I have no way of
explaining it.

58:13.991 --> 58:16.449
- Where's 167?
- Right there.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.450
Look, Mel, man,
you need to leave.

58:26.545 --> 58:27.660
You can't be
around us, man.

58:27.754 --> 58:28.994
- How is he?
- How is he?

58:29.089 --> 58:30.796
Nathan walked up and
stuck a bullet in him

58:30.882 --> 58:32.464
cause of something
you did, man.

58:32.551 --> 58:34.838
Just walked up and shot
the cat outside my place.

58:35.721 --> 58:36.711
I'm sorry, Luc.

58:36.805 --> 58:38.091
I am so sorry, bro.

58:38.181 --> 58:39.671
Hey, Mel, listen man.

58:39.766 --> 58:41.973
If you're really sorry, the best
thing you can do is leave, bro.

58:42.060 --> 58:42.845
Yeah, just get
the fuck it.

58:42.936 --> 58:44.677
Fuck you, Lyle.

58:44.771 --> 58:46.182
This is between
me and Lucille.

58:46.273 --> 58:48.264
Yeah, but it's not between
you and Lucille anymore, bro.

58:48.358 --> 58:49.564
It's between all of us.

58:49.651 --> 58:51.517
You're the one who brought
us into this thing.

58:51.611 --> 58:52.897
You need to walk away.

58:52.988 --> 58:54.194
He's right.

58:54.281 --> 58:56.818
I mean, you started a
war we can't fight, bro.

58:57.534 --> 58:58.695
H6)'-

58:58.785 --> 59:00.116
Hey!

59:00.203 --> 59:01.284
Promise me.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.738
Mel, look what
you got us into.

59:03.832 --> 59:05.789
Luc, talk to me.

59:08.795 --> 59:11.287
Let me take
of you, brother.

59:14.176 --> 59:16.383
Get the fuck out, Melvin.

59:22.434 --> 59:23.640
Alright.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.786
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:28.988
Melvin.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:30.569
Hey, JimmY-

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.205
I thought you were
giving up the drink.

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.662
Some things
change, I guess.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.794
You want a drink?

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:41.500
No.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.585
Gotta get going.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:44.883
Just wanted to say hello.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.586
Alright, Jimmy.

01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:49.046
Take her easy.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:56.496
Lucille.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.537
Lucille!

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.210
What the fuck you want?

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.961
I'm sorry.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:10.090
Man, keep your
damn voice down.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.670
I'm sorry.

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.631
You're drunk ain't
you, mother fucker?

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.015
God damn, Melvin.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.264
I'm not talking to your
ass while you're drunk.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.095
Just let me inside.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.524
Man, get the hell away
from my house, man.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:26.648
I'm tired of seeing
you like this, bro.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.236
I love you, man.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.510
Yo!

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.018
What's up, Mel?

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.145
You look like shit.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:09.270
What's going on?

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:10.900
Just wanna hang, man.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:11.980
Who is it?

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:13.031
It's Melvin.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:14.449
What does he want?

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:17.073
I don't want that mother fucker,
Nathan, showing up here.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.785
Anybody follow you here?

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.491
Yeah, these babies.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.996
How's he look, man?

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:24.997
He's wasted.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:26.624
Really? Did he
bring any friends?

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:28.671
Brought a whole fucking
bag full of 'em.

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:32.460
You wanna party, Mel?

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:34.882
Get your ass up here, man.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:36.463
What a fucking privilege.

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.599
Fucking A. We got our
old Melvin back.

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:43.645
Let's call someone.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.688
Hey, man, we'll
call lots of people.

01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:48.483
Oh, shit.

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:51.895
I'm happy to see you, man.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:54.152
I'm happy to see
you, too, brother.

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:55.073
Did they fuck
with you in there?

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.150
A little bit, man.

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:57.530
Sexually, no?

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.031
Fuck you, man.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.612
I don't know...

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.290
If it wasn't for Lucille, maybe
you'd be one of my best friends.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.292
Fuck being sober!

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:07.665
To being fucking back.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.919
When are the
bitches showing up?

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:18.676
- Fuck all this bullshit.
- Danny, where you going?

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:20.222
I'm putting music on.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.559
<i>L</i> gotta pee.

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:17.109
She was fat.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.531
No way. She wasn't fat.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:21.952
Just cause a chick got big
hips and a big ass doesn't

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.153
make her fat.

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:24.409
Now, if she got fat
hips and a fat ass...

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.081
No, did you see the size
of those fucking tits?

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:27.123
Those are motor
boating tits.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.700
Those are good tits.

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:29.830
Good tits for you.

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:31.036
You should did her, man.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.620
It's the reason why
we're running late now.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.753
Fucking liquor store's probably
not even open thanks to you.

01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:36.628
Yo, Mel.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.676
Is that you,
mother fucker?

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:42.222
Kiss my ass, Melvin.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.850
Fuck you, man!

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:51.231
I ain't no bitch!

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:56.611
- Holy shit.
- Aye, yo! Let's go!

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:00.861
Are you hit, man?

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.150
- No.
- You alright?

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:04.448
Guys, we gotta get
the fuck out of here?

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:05.779
Just take me to Lucas's.

01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:07.363
Dude, what's wrong, bro?

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:08.289
It's my heart.

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:09.707
Just get me there.

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:16.214
Fuck.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.212
Mel. Mel, this is...

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:24.423
This is crazy.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:26.428
I don't have a clue
what I'm looking for.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:28.225
You really need to
see a specialist.

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:29.895
I'll be alright.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.104
I just need to rest.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.555
But you're not alright.

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.267
The more you're using your
abilities, the more it's

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:36.647
hurting you.

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.524
Oh, yeah?

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.822
Thought you said you
weren't a specialist?

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.867
Mel, look, I...

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:48.697
I wanna help, but I'm not
comfortable with this.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.212
Son of a bitch.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.595
You son of a bitch.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:20.479
Son of a bitch.

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:23.524
Son of a bitch.

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:28.028
You are dumb playing
this game, mother fucker.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:33.165
Yeah, man.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.581
How's the arm?

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:40.965
I've had worse.

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.719
It's good to see you.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.888
Likewise, man.

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.276
I worry about you.

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:10.699
Come here, ma.

01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:19.379
Everything's
gonna be alright.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:27.840
Impressed?

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:49.692
So?

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:51.773
Brother, you the only
mother fucker I know

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.859
that'll turn a Porsche
into a Nissan and still

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:56.069
feel good about himself.

01:12:57.915 --> 01:12:59.246
Hey, JimmY-

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:00.414
H6)'-

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.165
How's Lucille holding up?

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:05.211
He's good.

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:06.459
He's doing better.

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:07.459
That's good.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.757
Listen, um...

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:11.130
Just wanted you to know
it's gonna get noisy at

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.836
C-block later.

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:15.547
You need me?

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:21.353
When you get the
call, ignore it.

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.225
I got this.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.521
Thanks, Jim.

01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:38.362
Chopin, Vagner,
Beethoven, Mozart.

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.242
You know what they
all have in common?

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.119
They're Europeans, man.

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:44.701
I mean, those cats had so
much history and culture

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:46.285
to draw from
when they wrote.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:50.465
That's why their concertos are
still amazing to this day.

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:53.384
I mean, listen to that.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:58.181
The changes, the notes,
the way it prociendos.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.382
It's perfect.

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:00.808
I fucking love it.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:09.434
We're here.

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:15.281
It's hot as a mother
fucker out here today.

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:19.118
Alright, man.
Let's go.

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:23.205
Oh, shit.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.498
What the fuck?

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.503
Man, what the fuck, man?

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:31.505
Shit, all the
shit's coming out.

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:32.753
Take it and put
that shit in there.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.008
Can't have the
feds see this, man.

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:36.882
Fuck, man.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:38.259
- Ah!

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.716
I know you out here, you
magic mother fucker!

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:43.301
Come out!

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:44.181
Oh, you fuck...

01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:45.227
Come on, Melvin!

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.271
I know you out there
you magic bitch.

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:50.900
Fuck!

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:03.579
What the fuck, man!

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.757
Fuck you!

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.138
I'm coming for
you, you bitch!

01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:25.263
You gonna fuck with me.

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:32.270
Alright, your
boys are running now!

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.396
Kiss my ass, Melvin.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.444
Come on!

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:36.521
Damn.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:37.730
Fuck!

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.986
Yeah, I like
seeing you run.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.195
Fuck you, man.

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:45.451
Yeah!

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:47.911
Crazy motherfucker!

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:49.458
Done, motherfucker.

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:54.830
This is gonna be fun.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:00.254
Hide and seek time,
mother fucker.

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:02.930
I remember playing this
when I was a kid.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.850
I love seeing you run.

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:14.359
Here I come!

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.538
I heard something happened
to that mother fucker Nathan.

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:30.950
I think he got the message.

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:32.752
I got somewhere
I wanna take you.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:34.078
Where is that?

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:36.581
You gotta know everything.

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:40.798
Man, I'm playing
like a salad up here.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:41.753
A what?

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:43.212
A salad.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.594
Getting tossed all
over the damn place.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.892
Gotta do something
about these roads.

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:51.437
I gotta get me a new
set of legs that work.

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:54.607
Yeah, or a new
chair that works.

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:58.027
Ain't nobody gonna buy me
a new chair, my brother.

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:02.278
I'm stuck in this old beat up
raggedy mother fucker for life.

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:06.319
You ready?

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:07.995
I been ready.

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:20.333
For me?

01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:22.589
Yeah, it's for you.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:31.769
Look at that.

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:33.563
Chrome.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.356
White leather.

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:37.524
You even put an I on it.

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:42.863
Well, shit! Don't just stand
there like you in a soup line.

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.907
Help me in the mother
fucking vessel.

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:48.945
Get that break on.

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:50.120
- You ready?
- Yea h.

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:51.322
One...

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:53.704
- I got you.
- You got me?

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.284
Bang.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:01.166
Oh, yeah.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.625
You got suspension.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.676
A cold one.

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:04.627
Oh, look at that, man.

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:05.507
You thought of everything.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:06.713
BMX wheels.

01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:08.093
Get that shit
out of the way.

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:09.925
Yeah, let me get rid of this.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:11.805
Give it a test drive.

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:16.059
Woo, baby!
Look at this thing!

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:17.060
Uh!

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.892
Oh, hell yeah!

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:19.942
You like those wheels?

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.019
I love these wheels, man.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:23.070
We can go off-reading
with these.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:31.788
You already know.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.665
I know.

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:36.329
Well, let's go
mother fucker.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.335
Push me somewhere. Shit.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:40.997
Get my roll on.

01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:43.628
Get my stroll on.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.130
Rolling up with
the I on the back of my

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:48.759
chair with no fears,
crystal clear, my dear.

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:51.341
Here he come, here he come
just having a little fun

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:53.392
and it's only just begun
underneath the sun.

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:57.604
Give him some legs,
give him some new wheels.

01:18:57.691 --> 01:19:00.683
What you say, boy?
Coppin' those pills

01:19:00.778 --> 01:19:03.736
I'm Lucille,
You'll cop a pill.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:06.280
Even though my
legs I can't feel.

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:41.894
Hi, Doreen.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.776
Can I talk to
you for a second?

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.103
Melvin.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:48.109
You're breaking the law by
being within one hundred

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.281
yards of me.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:50.199
I know.

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:51.071
I just need a...

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.201
just need a minute.

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:53.904
Melvin, you got ten
seconds to back away

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:55.488
before I call the cops.

01:19:55.582 --> 01:19:57.368
Call the cops.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.746
I got nothing
to lose anymore.

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:04.255
I'm lonely.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:07.834
Hm, that's what happens when
you screw your marriage up.

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:12.843
I just wanna see Rex.

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:15.800
Wanna walk home from
school and see his face.

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:17.635
Smell him.

01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:21.726
I just want him to know
that I'm here in case

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:23.899
something really
does happen to me.

01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:26.936
How do you sit here and
pretend to care when you're

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:29.113
the one who stopped helping
with his child support?

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:30.189
I never stopped.

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:32.491
I put money in the bank.

01:20:32.578 --> 01:20:33.864
Come on, Mel.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:36.446
Please let's not
play me for the fool.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:39.328
Doreen.

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:41.375
I got four thousand
dollars in Rex's name

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:45.376
right here and
there's more coming.

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.883
I just wanna see my boy.

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:56.591
Just let me walk
him home once.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.227
Come on.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.814
I gotta be insane.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.385
Here we go!

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:42.186
Yippee!

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:48.730
Hey, you.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:50.027
Yes?

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:52.863
Where's my little man?
Where is he?

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:53.735
I don't see him.

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:55.157
- Here I am!
- Where are you?

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.405
Hey!

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:58.031
Daddy, go faster.

01:21:58.122 --> 01:21:59.237
You wanna go faster?

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:05.452
- Alright.
- Yeah.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:07.332
Well, what do you know.

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:10.460
Well, what do you
know, little man.

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:14.881
We should get--

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:16.929
I can stand like you. Look.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:19.097
I can stand like you.

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:20.015
You hanging on?

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:21.684
Yeah.
