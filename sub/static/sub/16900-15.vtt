00:05.506 --> 00:08.090
Wow, this is an honor.

00:08.258 --> 00:13.138
I am friends with number four
on Maxim's list comedy.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.014
Thanks.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.558
At first I was mad that Jessica Simpson
was ahead of me.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.185
But then I saw the Dukes of Hazzard.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.020
Funny!

00:20.187 --> 00:21.271
What is that, baby oil?

00:21.438 --> 00:25.234
Actually, they use salad dressing,
'cause it gets a better sheen.

00:25.407 --> 00:26.360
This is ridiculous.

00:26.524 --> 00:28.770
What does any of this have to do with comedy?

00:28.944 --> 00:29.905
Ya burnt!

00:30.072 --> 00:30.904
Listen, I just...

00:31.079 --> 00:32.860
I wanna make sure you're not
gonna regret this, you know?

00:33.035 --> 00:35.823
Because it's not just cute guys
that buy these magazines,

00:35.998 --> 00:38.782
it's teenage boys with weird rashes

00:38.956 --> 00:40.871
and old guys that live at the Y.

00:41.045 --> 00:43.162
Liz, posing in Maxim is a great career move.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.463
There's no shame in it.

00:44.628 --> 00:48.963
I'm laughin', I'm horny,
let's do this!

00:49.925 --> 00:53.841
Put the chicken near your mouth.

00:56.096 --> 00:57.893
Awesome.

00:58.056 --> 01:00.221
Oh!

01:05.816 --> 01:07.522
Well, you look happy.

01:07.698 --> 01:09.310
Somebody just have
a root beer float?

01:09.487 --> 01:11.530
No, Josh's contract is up, which means

01:11.695 --> 01:15.361
it's time for my favorite thing
in the world, negotiation.

01:15.537 --> 01:17.912
The essence of capitalism.
There's nothing like it.

01:18.076 --> 01:20.371
God, I wish there was something
I could negotiate with right now.

01:20.537 --> 01:22.121
Hey, Jack?

01:22.297 --> 01:25.040
Just a reminder, I need a couple minutes
to go over breakage today-- how's noon?

01:25.216 --> 01:26.461
Can't do that.
Make it 4:00 AM.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.332
That's no good.

01:27.505 --> 01:28.501
What about after rehearsal?

01:28.676 --> 01:29.131
10:00.

01:29.297 --> 01:29.843
Stop insulting me.

01:30.006 --> 01:30.501
3:00 AM.

01:30.678 --> 01:31.041
Midnight.

01:31.217 --> 01:31.712
You bring the coffee.

01:31.886 --> 01:32.840
2:30, you bring the coffee.

01:33.016 --> 01:34.343
That's my final.

01:34.515 --> 01:36.800
Done.

01:37.978 --> 01:39.680
Wow, you do have a talent.

01:39.857 --> 01:41.851
I can't wait to go mano a mano with Josh.

01:42.016 --> 01:44.562
Right, I think you mean mano a toddler.

01:44.736 --> 01:47.312
Josh is a very sweet,
very dumb kid.

01:47.488 --> 01:48.650
Please go easy on him.

01:48.815 --> 01:50.901
I'll try to remember that when you
and I meet with him later.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.071
What, me? No.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.363
Don't make me be part of this.

01:53.536 --> 01:54.991
Lemon, I would like to teach you something.

01:55.155 --> 01:57.742
I would like to be Michelle Pfeiffer
to your angry black kid

01:57.916 --> 02:01.031
who learns that poetry
is just another way to rap.

02:01.207 --> 02:03.082
No, Jack, I don't wanna learn
about negotiation.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.543
I just want Josh to stay.
The show needs him.

02:05.707 --> 02:08.461
Lesson number one,
you don't need anyone.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.830
Sure, Josh tests well
with female viewers 12 to 24,

02:11.006 --> 02:11.922
which is important to advertisers,

02:12.096 --> 02:14.673
because young women will buy
just about anything.

02:14.845 --> 02:18.010
These sunglasses have a chip in them
that makes the lenses change color

02:18.187 --> 02:20.262
as my iPod loses power.

02:20.435 --> 02:24.310
But whatever Josh brings to the show,
he's still replaceable.

02:24.476 --> 02:26.102
He's not replaceable as my friend.

02:26.278 --> 02:28.390
He's not your friend now,
he's your opponent.

02:28.566 --> 02:32.230
He's going to try to grab all the marbles,
and it's our job to hide them.

02:32.406 --> 02:33.612
That's not how you play marbles, Jack.

02:33.776 --> 02:37.531
But that's how you keep them.

02:39.246 --> 02:42.532
Yo, remember that email we got
from those Nigerians

02:42.707 --> 02:45.662
that needed our help gettin'
all that money out of Africa?

02:45.836 --> 02:47.041
We did it!

02:47.207 --> 02:48.413
I got the check today.

02:48.586 --> 02:49.122
Say word?

02:49.298 --> 02:50.041
Word is bond.

02:50.217 --> 02:52.633
I would have been happy
if our only reward was just helping

02:52.796 --> 02:55.420
that dethroned prince of Nigeria,
but this is great!

02:55.598 --> 02:56.760
We should treat ourselves.

02:56.928 --> 02:58.840
Want to go to Vegas
and buy a bunch of sarcophagi?

02:59.016 --> 02:59.260
Nah.

02:59.425 --> 03:01.760
I don't even use
the ones I have.

03:01.936 --> 03:03.551
We could add someone else to the entourage.

03:03.727 --> 03:05.012
That's a good idea.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.021
Yo, what's young Larry doing these days?

03:07.188 --> 03:08.433
He's in Jay-Z's entourage.

03:08.608 --> 03:09.310
What about Cheese?

03:09.487 --> 03:10.942
He's rolling
with Ghostface Killer now.

03:11.105 --> 03:11.601
Fatballz?

03:11.777 --> 03:14.022
Studying hotel administration at Cornell.

03:14.197 --> 03:16.021
Well, go ahead, Fatballz!

03:16.195 --> 03:17.940
That's a good program.

03:18.117 --> 03:19.152
Hello there, Mr. Jordan.

03:19.327 --> 03:20.533
Mr. Slattery, Mr. Griswold.

03:20.705 --> 03:22.073
I picked up your lunch from Sylvia's.

03:22.246 --> 03:23.822
Extra cornbread
because I know you like it.

03:23.996 --> 03:24.412
Like it?

03:24.586 --> 03:25.913
I love it!

03:26.086 --> 03:27.793
I love this cornbread so much
I wanna take it

03:27.957 --> 03:32.211
behind a middle school
and get it pregnant.

03:32.377 --> 03:33.962
Pregnant cornbread.

03:34.135 --> 03:36.091
K, you like doing stuff for me, right?

03:36.257 --> 03:38.553
How would you like to be in my entourage?

03:38.717 --> 03:40.222
Well, that sounds like fun!

03:40.386 --> 03:41.131
What would I do?

03:41.305 --> 03:42.053
Well, let's see.

03:42.228 --> 03:44.142
Dotcom does the driving
and the cooking.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.312
Grizz is in charge of sitting on me
when I get over stimulated.

03:47.475 --> 03:52.021
But I have been looking for someone
to harmonize with me.

03:52.197 --> 03:54.023
The sun'll come out

03:54.198 --> 03:55.562
Tomorrow

03:55.738 --> 03:56.402
Tomorrow

03:56.575 --> 03:57.571
Bet your bottom dollar

03:57.737 --> 03:59.190
that tomorrow

03:59.365 --> 04:00.441
Fa la la la

04:00.615 --> 04:03.162
There'll be sun

04:03.328 --> 04:05.072
This is a really special day.

04:05.247 --> 04:08.660
Just thinking about to--

04:10.000 --> 04:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:28.397 --> 04:28.560
Nice.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.180
Yowza.

04:29.355 --> 04:31.311
Isn't it great?

04:31.488 --> 04:34.273
These are the sexiest women in comedy?

04:34.445 --> 04:36.313
Where's Jackée?

04:36.487 --> 04:38.482
Jenna, have you read your interview yet?

04:38.655 --> 04:38.982
Oh, no.

04:39.157 --> 04:40.192
Did I come across as interesting?

04:40.366 --> 04:42.193
'Cause I tried to mention Bono
as much as possible.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.492
No, you come across as crazy.

04:44.666 --> 04:47.532
Why did you tell the reporter
that you hate the troops?

04:47.708 --> 04:48.202
What?

04:48.378 --> 04:52.252
I didn't say
I hate the troops.

05:04.808 --> 05:07.053
but it's just
a bunch of gay guys

05:07.228 --> 05:10.932
that like to get in silly costumes
and prance around.

05:11.108 --> 05:12.722
No, Liz, he heard me wrong.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.732
You know
that I love the troops.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.520
Do you remember that fleet week
after I broke up with David?

05:17.697 --> 05:19.233
Oh, God, this is bad.

05:19.408 --> 05:21.530
Nobody reads the articles
in these things, right?

05:21.696 --> 05:23.361
Maybe no one'll pick it up?

05:23.536 --> 05:30.080
These Hollyweirdos from La La Land
like Jenna Moron-ey are just un-American!

05:30.957 --> 05:34.791
So we are calling for a boycott of NBC,
General Electric,

05:34.965 --> 05:39.382
and their parent company
the Sheinhardt Wig Corporation.

05:39.546 --> 05:41.092
Jack, I was misquoted.

05:41.257 --> 05:41.803
This is my fault.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.341
I never should have let her do
this Maxim thing in the first place.

05:44.606 --> 05:45.920
We're going to nip this thing in the bud.

05:46.094 --> 05:50.050
Jenna is going to make a public apology
tomorrow on Hardball.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.015
You know what that is, don't you?

05:51.182 --> 05:51.934
Yes.

05:52.109 --> 05:53.970
Should I prepare a song?

05:54.148 --> 05:56.891
I really can't wait
to renegotiate your contract.

05:57.068 --> 05:59.982
Thank you, sir.

06:02.577 --> 06:03.610
What?

06:03.785 --> 06:04.280
Hey.

06:04.445 --> 06:07.032
Does my vulva look swollen?

06:07.206 --> 06:08.323
Come here.

06:08.495 --> 06:11.533
I just wanna warn you as a friend
about this contract thing.

06:11.708 --> 06:13.743
Jack is gunning for you.

06:13.918 --> 06:14.953
Really?

06:15.127 --> 06:16.912
Don't worry, you're not going anywhere.

06:17.086 --> 06:21.591
Jack said advertisers love you,
because you test great with women 12 to 24.

06:21.758 --> 06:22.542
Which advertisers?

06:22.717 --> 06:24.303
Could I get free Choco Sticks?

06:24.466 --> 06:28.182
Just don't be pushy about your contract,
and I promise we will get through this.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.220
Yeah, um...

06:30.395 --> 06:33.893
Alan actually told me
not to talk to anybody about this.

06:34.065 --> 06:35.060
Alan?

06:35.225 --> 06:36.560
Who's Alan?

06:36.735 --> 06:38.443
Jacuzzi, the whole nine yards.

06:38.605 --> 06:39.692
Jack.

06:39.856 --> 06:41.272
Jack Donaghy.

06:41.448 --> 06:42.443
Alan Steiner.

06:42.618 --> 06:44.273
Good to see ya.
I'm Josh Gerard's agent.

06:44.448 --> 06:45.573
Oh, really?

06:45.738 --> 06:48.573
Listen, I'd love to grab
a little face time with you

06:48.746 --> 06:50.492
re: Josh's contract offer.

06:50.665 --> 06:52.782
We've got some serious troubs, my friend.

06:52.958 --> 06:55.490
We are not smiles-times.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.913
I'm sorry to hear that, Alan.

06:57.085 --> 06:59.000
What your skedge mañana?

06:59.168 --> 07:02.840
'Cause this is gonna be one serious negosh.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.502
My skedge is wide open, Alan.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.260
Hasta mañana.

07:08.425 --> 07:09.472
What a man, what a man

07:09.635 --> 07:11.840
what a mighty good man

07:12.015 --> 07:13.553
Mighty mighty good man

07:13.728 --> 07:16.013
Yeah!

07:16.316 --> 07:19.061
So, entourage, what's
on the schedule for today?

07:19.235 --> 07:20.442
I have us penciled in for Halo.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.852
I love Halo!

07:22.026 --> 07:23.980
I love Halo so much,
I wanna take it out

07:24.155 --> 07:28.742
behind a middle school
and get it pregnant!

07:29.407 --> 07:30.740
Why are you guys laughing so hard?

07:30.905 --> 07:33.070
That's the same joke
Mr. Jordan said earlier.

07:33.247 --> 07:34.620
I don't think so, K.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.743
 'Cause I like
to keep my material fresh.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.583
I like to keep things fresh so much,
that I wanna take it out

07:39.758 --> 07:44.463
behind the middle school
and get it pregnant.

07:47.928 --> 07:49.340
Whoa, who just killed me?

07:49.517 --> 07:50.471
That's never happened before.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.551
I did, Mr. Jordan!

07:51.726 --> 07:52.971
That's impossible!

07:53.146 --> 07:54.893
I've beat all the world's best players.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.350
Grizz, Dotcom, my publicist,
my stylist...

07:58.525 --> 07:59.643
Oh, well...

07:59.815 --> 08:00.891
I just killed you again!

08:01.065 --> 08:02.021
You're cheating!

08:02.195 --> 08:03.401
And I don't wanna play no more!

08:03.566 --> 08:05.860
I hate this!

08:06.028 --> 08:06.611
Grizz!

08:06.778 --> 08:10.993
I think it's best
you come sit on me.

08:13.745 --> 08:17.661
And I just want the troops to kill everyone
and come on home.

08:17.836 --> 08:18.992
Pretty good.

08:19.167 --> 08:22.662
But this is Hardball, Jenna,
so you might wanna be more specific.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.132
You could say
that you support the troops,

08:25.296 --> 08:26.883
but you feel that the war was poorly planned

08:27.048 --> 08:28.673
and started under false pretenses.

08:28.845 --> 08:32.049
And that we should have used those resources
to hunt down Osama Bin Laden.

08:32.225 --> 08:33.342
Liz, I'm just worried
that I'm gonna

08:33.518 --> 08:35.143
sound like I don't know
what I'm talking about.

08:35.308 --> 08:37.970
Hey, would Sharon Stone worry about that?

08:38.145 --> 08:38.932
Mm-mm.

08:39.107 --> 08:40.432
Would Richard Gere?

08:40.606 --> 08:41.602
No.

08:41.775 --> 08:46.563
Then you go out there
and you voice your opinions like a star.

08:46.736 --> 08:48.480
Okay, what are you gonna do
if they ask about '08?

08:48.658 --> 08:51.033
Well, of course I want Hillary
to be the first woman president.

08:51.196 --> 08:51.612
Ugh.

08:51.785 --> 08:52.442
No, Obama.

08:52.617 --> 08:54.153
You support Barrack Obama.

08:54.328 --> 08:56.491
Remember, you liked those pictures
of him at the beach?

08:56.668 --> 08:57.870
Oh, right.

08:58.035 --> 09:00.080
Obama, what is he, Hispanic?

09:00.246 --> 09:00.953
No, he's black.

09:01.128 --> 09:02.542
And he's running for President?

09:02.708 --> 09:05.292
Good luck.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.171
Is this new furniture?

09:11.348 --> 09:13.631
This is my negotiation set.

09:13.808 --> 09:15.433
What?

09:15.595 --> 09:19.223
Gentlemen, please sit down.

09:25.108 --> 09:29.061
All right, let's skip the foreplay
and get right to the penetraish.

09:29.236 --> 09:33.363
Josh is looking for a 15% raise,
a two-pic guarantee from Universal,

09:33.537 --> 09:36.702
and time off for every Jewish holiday
no matter how ridiculous.

09:36.866 --> 09:38.411
I mean, Yaznach is coming up.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.160
That seems pretty reasonable, right, Jack?

09:40.337 --> 09:43.703
Here's my counteroffer.

09:44.088 --> 09:46.002
One dollar.

09:46.176 --> 09:46.830
What?

09:47.007 --> 09:47.623
Oh, boy.

09:47.798 --> 09:48.542
 That's absurd.

09:48.717 --> 09:49.543
You know what's absurd?

09:49.807 --> 09:55.920
These photos I found of Josh
roughhousing with Lance Bass at SeaWorld.

09:56.136 --> 09:57.631
What, we were just being silly.

09:57.807 --> 09:59.140
My offer is now 75 cents.

09:59.305 --> 10:01.891
Tic toc tic toc tic toc.

10:02.067 --> 10:03.223
It keeps getting lower.

10:03.398 --> 10:04.430
I think we should take it.

10:04.607 --> 10:06.312
Relax.

10:06.487 --> 10:08.192
Look, Jack...

10:08.355 --> 10:09.771
we know about the testing.

10:09.946 --> 10:13.400
Women from 12 to 24...
love my guy.

10:13.575 --> 10:16.032
Who told you that?

10:16.206 --> 10:16.860
Oh, Liz did.

10:17.036 --> 10:17.822
Shut up.

10:17.996 --> 10:18.611
What?

10:18.786 --> 10:20.450
That was privileged information.

10:20.625 --> 10:21.951
That's what I thought.

10:22.128 --> 10:23.332
Awse.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.913
We are back in the game.

10:27.468 --> 10:31.922
I knew you weren't ready for a big chair.

10:36.557 --> 10:39.092
Yo, Kenneth,
we need to talk, man.

10:39.267 --> 10:41.510
Oh, I've had this conversation before.

10:41.685 --> 10:43.433
You're marrying my mom, aren't you?

10:43.606 --> 10:44.431
No.

10:44.605 --> 10:46.643
It's about how you're treating Tracy.

10:46.816 --> 10:49.652
You're beating him at Halo,
you're not laughing at his jokes.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.483
He's the king around here.
You gotta respect that.

10:52.657 --> 10:53.402
Oh, my gosh.

10:53.576 --> 10:56.150
I had no idea
I was causing a problem.

10:56.326 --> 10:58.823
Hey, I got next game.

10:58.995 --> 11:00.861
Hold up.

11:01.037 --> 11:02.910
How are you beating Kenneth, Grizz?

11:03.086 --> 11:04.032
I don't know.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.501
If Kenneth can beat me,
and you can beat Kenneth,

11:06.667 --> 11:09.871
then by the transitive property,
you should beat me too!

11:10.045 --> 11:12.381
Have you been letting me win?

11:12.546 --> 11:14.171
Just at some things.

11:14.345 --> 11:15.130
Things?

11:15.308 --> 11:17.710
Plural?

11:18.348 --> 11:22.893
What is the world's
only egg-laying mammal?

11:23.055 --> 11:24.220
The Easter bunny!

11:24.398 --> 11:25.973
Right again!

11:26.145 --> 11:27.811
That's a green pie piece.

11:27.985 --> 11:29.773
Amazed.

11:29.948 --> 11:32.310
Raaah!

11:32.907 --> 11:33.980
Yeah, what, cat?

11:34.157 --> 11:34.940
Yeah, Dotcom!

11:35.115 --> 11:36.482
Yeah, Grizz!

11:36.657 --> 11:39.151
Have you two been treating me
like this all this time?

11:39.328 --> 11:40.363
Like a child?

11:40.538 --> 11:42.701
No no no, I won't stand for this.

11:42.875 --> 11:46.081
Entourage disbanded!

11:50.508 --> 11:51.793
Oh, my.

11:51.965 --> 11:53.961
Tucker Carlson, you heard
what Jenna Maroney had to say.

11:54.138 --> 11:55.133
She supports the troops.

11:55.295 --> 11:56.093
Well, here's a question, Chris.

11:56.256 --> 11:57.803
Why do we care
what she thinks about anything?

11:57.965 --> 11:59.761
This woman strikes me
as another empty-headed

11:59.925 --> 12:02.382
self-involved member
of the Hollywood ignorati.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.512
You know, for someone
who's super super hot,

12:04.686 --> 12:05.801
you're really cranky.

12:05.977 --> 12:09.350
I have just as much right
to my opinion as you or Chris.

12:09.526 --> 12:10.270
I'm not sure you do.

12:10.437 --> 12:12.020
You've been on the show
for 20 minutes now.

12:12.197 --> 12:14.901
You sang six bars of something
called Muffin Top.

12:15.065 --> 12:15.481
Thank you.

12:15.656 --> 12:18.360
And then told a disgusting story
about Fleet Week.

12:18.537 --> 12:21.033
I guess this is the state
of political
discourse in this country nowadays.

12:21.205 --> 12:22.362
And that's fine,
let's just embrace it.

12:22.538 --> 12:26.031
Let's have our policies determined
by former Cable Ace Award nominees.

12:26.207 --> 12:28.791
First, I was great in that Arliss.

12:28.958 --> 12:32.411
Second of all, if they president is so serious
about the war of terror,

12:32.586 --> 12:36.463
why doesn't he hunt down and capture
Barrack Obama before he strikes again?

12:36.636 --> 12:38.251
It's time for a change, America.

12:38.425 --> 12:42.803
That's why I'm voting for Osama in 2008.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.971
Oh, no comeback?

12:46.146 --> 12:48.681
Ya burnt!

12:55.238 --> 12:57.311
Hey, Jack, I was totally gonna call you.

12:57.488 --> 12:59.941
Which of your massive screw-ups
should we discuss first?

13:00.115 --> 13:02.113
How about the Jenna situation?

13:02.285 --> 13:03.451
That is taken care of.

13:03.707 --> 13:05.821
I have written an op ed piece
for the New York Times

13:05.998 --> 13:09.622
under Jenna's name
in which I put the media on trial.

13:09.798 --> 13:10.953
Boo!
Here's the plan.

13:11.126 --> 13:12.661
We're gonna take Jenna,
put some flags behind her,

13:12.837 --> 13:15.422
have her sing a song that rhymes USA
with "Make them pay,"

13:15.587 --> 13:17.331
dress her in an eagle costume,
and we're gonna call it

13:17.506 --> 13:18.631
a salute to the troops episode.

13:18.796 --> 13:19.251
Okay.

13:19.426 --> 13:20.842
Moving on, Josh Gerard.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.593
I had him right where I wanted him.

13:22.765 --> 13:25.510
Until my partner
stabbed me in the back.

13:25.685 --> 13:26.932
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.

13:27.096 --> 13:28.892
I was just trying
to give my friend a head's up.

13:29.056 --> 13:34.851
Why can't we all just sit down
in normal chairs and figure this out?

13:35.026 --> 13:36.981
Suri, is Josh in yet?

13:37.158 --> 13:38.401
Josh isn't coming in today.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.191
He's sick.

13:39.365 --> 13:40.572
He said he was throwing up all night.

13:40.735 --> 13:42.232
A sick out?

13:42.405 --> 13:43.611
I didn't think
he had it in him.

13:43.788 --> 13:44.861
What are you talking about?

13:45.035 --> 13:45.573
He's faking.

13:45.745 --> 13:47.611
He's gonna stay home
until we give in to his demands.

13:47.788 --> 13:51.121
No, Josh could not come up
with a sneaky plan like that.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.331
He told me he was a pallbearer
at his brother's wedding.

13:54.506 --> 13:57.170
He's probably just sick
because he's stressed out about his job.

13:57.336 --> 14:00.092
Lemon, what happened in your childhood
to make you believe that people are good?

14:00.255 --> 14:00.922
You know what?

14:01.096 --> 14:03.592
If my friendships
and my job are in compatible,

14:03.767 --> 14:05.303
I choose my friends.

14:05.476 --> 14:07.633
And right now, I am going
to get some chicken soup

14:07.806 --> 14:10.101
from Josh's favorite place
and take it to him

14:10.267 --> 14:14.432
and say that
I hope he feels better.

14:14.817 --> 14:17.141
Do you ever get any emails
other than from match.com?

14:17.316 --> 14:20.730
No no, don't look at that.

14:20.906 --> 14:22.820
Aaah!

14:22.985 --> 14:25.283
Damn it!

14:25.448 --> 14:26.530
Close, right?

14:26.706 --> 14:28.161
Feel like I'm above the rim.

14:28.327 --> 14:29.911
Can't palm the ball.

14:30.076 --> 14:33.541
Sir, I think you made a mistake
firing Grizz and Dotcom.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.663
They just wanna make you
feel better about yourself.

14:35.835 --> 14:37.292
They disrespected me.

14:37.467 --> 14:38.672
But don't you miss them?

14:38.838 --> 14:40.710
You're the only one
I can trust, K.

14:40.887 --> 14:42.213
You're my whole entourage now.

14:42.385 --> 14:44.551
Oh, I'm not so sure
I can handle that.

14:44.716 --> 14:45.762
Yes, you can.

14:45.926 --> 14:46.973
Because you were honest with me.

14:47.138 --> 14:48.763
I don't need a couple of yes-men.

14:48.936 --> 14:50.390
I need the truth.

14:50.558 --> 14:54.011
Well, if that's the case...
then you should know

14:54.187 --> 14:56.432
that you're never gonna dunk this basketball.

14:56.607 --> 14:58.773
Also, that Oscar you have
is made of chocolate.

14:58.945 --> 15:00.771
And that lady
you European kissed last night

15:00.948 --> 15:01.613
was actually a gentleman...

15:01.775 --> 15:04.983
Okay, that's enough.

15:06.076 --> 15:07.531
Oh, here comes one right now.

15:07.696 --> 15:09.613
Excuse me, do you work for NBC?

15:09.786 --> 15:12.203
Oh, no, I was just passing through
there on my way to church.

15:12.377 --> 15:14.491
Well, are you interested
in taking back your country?

15:14.668 --> 15:15.240
Am I!

15:15.416 --> 15:22.132
Then join here tomorrow night
for a protest against the freedom-hating
Jenna Maroney and TGS!

15:22.297 --> 15:23.502
There will be snacks!

15:23.678 --> 15:27.301
I will definitely be there.

15:27.518 --> 15:29.093
Large chicken soup to go, please.

15:29.265 --> 15:30.262
John and I saw your tape.

15:30.436 --> 15:31.393
Very very impressed.

15:31.558 --> 15:34.432
You seem like a perfect match
for The Daily Show.

15:34.607 --> 15:36.722
We are always looking for new correspondents.

15:36.898 --> 15:40.230
Josh? You stupid turd.

15:41.485 --> 15:43.020
Hey!

15:43.198 --> 15:44.613
Liz.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.522
This is...

15:45.698 --> 15:46.650
Yeah, I can guess who this is.

15:46.827 --> 15:50.400
Are you trying to get on another show?
Behind my back?

15:50.575 --> 15:52.741
Look, Liz, I'm sorry.
It's just business.

15:52.916 --> 15:54.660
No, it's not business.

15:54.835 --> 15:55.913
I stood up for you.

15:56.086 --> 15:59.041
You were opening for a puppet
when I found you.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.463
How could you
betray me like this?

16:01.625 --> 16:03.250
You know, that's not even
the worst part.

16:03.428 --> 16:04.422
You know what
the worst part is?

16:04.595 --> 16:08.052
You proved Jack Donaghy right!

16:08.215 --> 16:10.591
Again!

16:11.015 --> 16:13.011
And by the way,
what kind of moron

16:13.188 --> 16:15.723
calls out sick
and then comes to work to have a meeting?

16:15.898 --> 16:17.103
I get an NBC discount here.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.681
Idiot!

16:18.857 --> 16:22.481
I'm a big fan of your show.

16:27.326 --> 16:28.901
I want you to crush Josh.

16:29.078 --> 16:32.490
I want you to crush him.

16:35.827 --> 16:37.622
Mr. Jordan, Keith called on your cell.

16:37.787 --> 16:40.702
He said they were "at the thing,
and Lil' Zay just end up running."

16:40.878 --> 16:41.830
What did you tell him?

16:42.007 --> 16:44.581
Well, he wanted Dwayne Jr.'s number,
so I gave it to him.

16:44.758 --> 16:45.670
You did what?

16:45.837 --> 16:49.762
Damn it, K, now I have to hear
from Tanisha's mom on how
they both mad at the twins.

16:49.927 --> 16:51.383
You have to handle this stuff better.

16:51.558 --> 16:53.592
Mr. Jordan, I don't know
any of these people.

16:53.767 --> 16:55.892
But Grizz would have...

16:56.056 --> 16:58.510
Damn it, turn on the TV for me.

16:58.686 --> 17:00.471
Dotcom set this up.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.692
I don't know how it works.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.813
Television on!

17:05.987 --> 17:08.692
Pornography!

17:10.406 --> 17:11.073
Good, you're here.

17:11.244 --> 17:13.073
Josh and his agent
are on their way up.

17:13.248 --> 17:14.032
Ha ha, yeah.

17:14.208 --> 17:16.701
Then they're gonna be on their way down.

17:16.876 --> 17:18.083
Um, you know,
that was weak.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.453
But you're in the mix,
you're having fun.

17:19.626 --> 17:20.663
I like that.

17:20.836 --> 17:22.040
Gentlemen!

17:22.208 --> 17:25.872
Make yourselves comfortable.

17:29.098 --> 17:30.670
What are all these headshots for?

17:30.845 --> 17:31.262
Nothing.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.473
Just some meetings we're taking.

17:33.638 --> 17:34.173
Meetings?

17:34.346 --> 17:35.262
And if...

17:35.438 --> 17:39.012
Look, Jack, I think I should tell you,
Josh has an offer from The Daily Show.

17:39.186 --> 17:40.223
Yes, Liz mentioned that.

17:40.396 --> 17:42.023
I don't think that's gonna pan out.

17:42.188 --> 17:43.023
What, are you kidding?

17:43.188 --> 17:43.523
What happened?

17:43.685 --> 17:44.732
What'd you do to our offer?

17:44.896 --> 17:46.063
I called my friend
Saul Sheinhardt

17:46.236 --> 17:49.153
at our parent company Sheinhardt Wigs
who called his nephew Morty Sheinhardt

17:49.315 --> 17:51.822
who called his son, John Stewart.

17:51.986 --> 17:53.190
 Ah ha

17:53.367 --> 17:54.281
Ya burnt!

17:54.446 --> 17:55.201
Let's get down to brass tacks.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.033
Josh can stay.

17:56.205 --> 17:56.823
Thank God!

17:56.997 --> 17:58.413
But no raise, no movies.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.620
And only one Jewish holiday.

17:59.786 --> 18:00.663
What's the one
where they go into the tent?

18:00.838 --> 18:01.330
Sukkot.

18:01.495 --> 18:02.411
That's the one.
We have a deal?

18:02.586 --> 18:04.660
Deal, thank you.
I need this money.

18:04.837 --> 18:07.211
I have a really bad sex addiction.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.002
Sorry.

18:08.176 --> 18:08.881
That's it?

18:09.047 --> 18:11.212
I thought you said
we could crush him.

18:11.387 --> 18:12.210
What are you talking about?

18:12.385 --> 18:13.262
I took away everything.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.012
That's crushing.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.260
No, do more stuff!

18:16.438 --> 18:17.803
You made me look like an idiot.

18:17.978 --> 18:18.932
You have to pay.

18:19.095 --> 18:20.393
Liz, he's not getting a raise.

18:20.556 --> 18:23.270
Do the worm!

18:23.727 --> 18:26.442
Do the worm!

18:28.945 --> 18:30.521
Good Lord, the worm!

18:30.697 --> 18:31.902
That's so degrading.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.571
Are its origins German?

18:33.737 --> 18:36.112
Now say five reasons
I'm better than you!

18:36.287 --> 18:36.900
Smarter than me.

18:37.075 --> 18:37.702
One!

18:37.865 --> 18:38.823
You can beat me
in arm wrestling.

18:38.996 --> 18:39.781
Two!

18:39.958 --> 18:40.910
You read the paper.

18:41.077 --> 18:42.581
Yeah, suck it,
I do read the paper.

18:42.746 --> 18:43.490
You want me to do anything?

18:43.666 --> 18:44.243
Be a crab!

18:44.418 --> 18:46.710
Crab.

18:47.046 --> 18:48.000
Fight the worm!

18:48.176 --> 18:49.420
Wow!

18:49.588 --> 18:51.460
Liz, you took to this
like a natural.

18:51.635 --> 18:52.670
More than I ever...

18:52.847 --> 18:54.842
Okay, now, the crab
is getting aroused.

18:55.015 --> 18:56.300
Shut it down.

18:56.475 --> 18:57.972
Shut it down.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.263
Small town worn fatigues

19:00.436 --> 19:02.801
Big dreams and little leagues

19:02.976 --> 19:04.893
Gigantic star-spangled

19:05.066 --> 19:06.060
fireworks

19:06.235 --> 19:09.310
Light up the night

19:09.656 --> 19:11.811
You know, you actually
did a good job on this.

19:11.987 --> 19:13.021
Why do you sound so surprised?

19:13.195 --> 19:14.070
I love America.

19:14.235 --> 19:16.691
Just because I think gay dudes
should be allowed to adopt kids

19:16.866 --> 19:21.201
and we should all have hybrid cars,
doesn't mean I don't love America.

19:21.378 --> 19:23.661
I said America

19:23.835 --> 19:26.833
She said America.

19:30.257 --> 19:32.843
And cue the pinwheels.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.422
Okay, the pinwheels are lit,
but they're not spinning.

19:35.595 --> 19:38.802
When they're not spinning,
they look exactly like...

19:38.975 --> 19:41.550
Swastikas.

19:51.408 --> 19:54.820
TGS, Totally Godless Suckers.

19:54.987 --> 19:55.863
Or Satanists.

19:56.025 --> 19:57.732
Ooh, that's even better.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.071
Hi!

20:05.747 --> 20:06.291
Entourage...

20:06.458 --> 20:08.540
Oh!

20:08.706 --> 20:09.791
You gotta get me out of here!

20:09.968 --> 20:12.623
Make a path, please!

20:12.796 --> 20:15.091
Help!

20:31.147 --> 20:33.102
Wow, Tray, you really saved us
from that crowd, yo.

20:33.278 --> 20:34.233
You sure did, man.

20:34.405 --> 20:35.402
You sure did.

20:35.565 --> 20:36.193
Yeah.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.861
Of course I did!

20:38.037 --> 20:39.612
I love you guys.

20:39.787 --> 20:41.741
I love you so much,
I'm gonna take you

20:41.906 --> 20:45.870
behind the middle school
and get you pregnant.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.202
I love you, Dotcom.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.790
I love you, Grizz.

20:49.955 --> 20:53.502
And I will always love you

20:55.466 --> 20:59.000
And I will always love you

21:00.305 --> 21:06.674
