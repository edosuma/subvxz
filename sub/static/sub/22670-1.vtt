46:34.425 --> 46:36.693
But our helmet's muted.

46:38.928 --> 46:40.260
Who are you people again?

46:40.262 --> 46:41.863
We're from DARPA.

46:41.865 --> 46:44.365
- And who sent you here?
- EMMA: No one sent is here.

46:44.367 --> 46:46.100
EMMA: We've seen this thing up close.

46:46.102 --> 46:49.604
It's large, powerful, and...

46:49.606 --> 46:52.307
extremely pissed off.

46:52.309 --> 46:54.108
Comm squadrons have been working overtime

46:54.110 --> 46:57.579
trying to maintain an open
line with the outside world.

46:57.581 --> 47:00.682
Problem is the outside world
keeps losing more power.

47:00.684 --> 47:04.385
Damn near close to relying
on ham radios around here.

47:04.387 --> 47:07.189
That may be their intentions, sir.

47:07.191 --> 47:09.758
And who are "they" exactly?

47:09.760 --> 47:11.926
Our computer and phone
networks may be crapping out,

47:11.928 --> 47:14.695
but what I'm hearing everyone's
spooked over some Pulgasari

47:14.697 --> 47:17.000
rampaging through Los Angeles.

47:18.102 --> 47:20.301
[roaring]

47:20.303 --> 47:22.903
[screaming]

47:22.905 --> 47:25.240
GENERAL: There's been a sighting
north of here and in Texas.

47:25.242 --> 47:28.343
So that's three confirmed
in the United States already.

47:28.345 --> 47:31.113
And what about the rest of the world?

47:31.115 --> 47:34.048
As of now, no other confirmed sightings
anywhere but in the United States.

47:34.050 --> 47:36.919
There're more coming. A lot more.

47:36.921 --> 47:38.419
And why is that?

47:38.421 --> 47:41.655
I think we've located one of
their nests in Joshua Tree.

47:41.657 --> 47:45.496
It had been bleeding from
when it rammed into our Helo.

47:48.631 --> 47:50.767
But what we found in the blood,

47:52.302 --> 47:55.403
clusters of spores,

47:55.405 --> 47:56.872
egg sacks.

47:56.874 --> 47:59.140
They opened up.

47:59.142 --> 48:01.142
Things crawled out.

48:01.144 --> 48:02.443
Things?

48:02.445 --> 48:06.648
Like a black slime and ooze.

48:06.650 --> 48:09.919
Formed into a solid organism
shortly after being birthed.

48:19.296 --> 48:21.528
Ishiro stepped on one of them.

48:21.530 --> 48:23.731
EMMA: It sort of sounded like a jelly.

48:23.733 --> 48:26.469
And then it forms into a worm some kind.

48:27.704 --> 48:29.604
I don't know how you got onto my base,

48:29.606 --> 48:32.073
- But get this shoe off...
- Damn it!

48:32.075 --> 48:33.608
If I'm right,

48:33.610 --> 48:36.946
this problem is about to
get exponentially worse.

48:37.514 --> 48:39.180
[sighs]

48:39.182 --> 48:42.151
So how do you propose we
stop that from happening?

48:42.153 --> 48:43.818
Incendiary tipped payloads.

48:43.820 --> 48:46.854
High explosive incendiaries
should kill those things

48:46.856 --> 48:50.360
and destroy the spores
with extreme temperatures.

48:52.430 --> 48:55.062
I'll take that under advisement.

48:55.064 --> 48:56.530
We need a plane.

48:56.532 --> 48:58.767
You need a plane?

48:58.769 --> 49:01.135
The helmet doesn't just dampen the flaring.

49:01.137 --> 49:05.908
It was designed to fly an
airplane with the power of thought.

49:05.910 --> 49:09.276
- Lady, I don't have time for this.
- It will work.

49:09.278 --> 49:11.879
We've been developing it at
DARPA for the past three years.

49:11.881 --> 49:15.649
All we need is put it inside
and operational aircraft.

49:15.651 --> 49:18.555
EMMA: Please. You need to believe me.

49:21.358 --> 49:23.258
This Neuro program of yours,

49:23.260 --> 49:26.461
you really think it'll
fly one of these planes?

49:26.463 --> 49:30.064
We just need to find one that's
going accommodate the hardware.

49:30.066 --> 49:34.334
This is AMARG. The Aerospace
Maintenance and Regeneration Group.

49:34.336 --> 49:37.606
The largest military aircraft
boneyard in the world.

49:37.608 --> 49:39.341
Everything is laid out by "type."

49:39.343 --> 49:42.042
Over there are the 1000's,
those are deemed inviolate,

49:42.044 --> 49:44.646
no parts have been removed,
they are your best bet

49:44.648 --> 49:46.747
for getting up in the air quickest.

49:46.749 --> 49:52.519
Those are the 3000s, maintained in
flyable condition for temporary storage.

49:52.521 --> 49:54.088
Also a good place to look.

49:54.090 --> 49:56.624
And then you have the 2000's,

49:56.626 --> 49:58.693
That's all the aircraft
we keep around for parts

49:58.695 --> 50:01.762
for other working aircraft.

50:01.764 --> 50:04.666
You're welcome to
whatever you need in there.

50:04.668 --> 50:06.503
[whispering]

50:08.037 --> 50:11.006
What about those?

50:11.008 --> 50:13.474
Just take your pick.

50:13.476 --> 50:16.745
My team will lead the first attack
as the first wave of fighters.

50:16.747 --> 50:18.646
Hit it with enough fire power to wound it,

50:18.648 --> 50:22.184
even out the playing field for
your pilots to come in and clean up.

50:22.186 --> 50:25.586
These are seasoned veterans with
thousands of hours of experience.

50:25.588 --> 50:30.725
Ishi over here flew F-16's with
the D.C. Air National Guard.

50:30.727 --> 50:34.195
And Sandy, trained with
the Naval Air Station

50:34.197 --> 50:35.963
where she flew Skyhawks.

50:35.965 --> 50:37.932
- Bruce...
- Ended up on this chair

50:37.934 --> 50:41.872
after a close fly over
Northwest of Baghdad in 2006.

50:43.539 --> 50:45.472
My apologies.

50:45.474 --> 50:49.077
With all due respect sir,
I don't need your apology.

50:49.079 --> 50:51.916
What we need now is a vote of confidence.

50:53.983 --> 50:56.785
[whispers] Sir. We lost three
pilots of the Eastern Squadron.

50:56.787 --> 51:00.488
Ground forces are depleted.
Waiting on a sitrep.

51:00.490 --> 51:02.760
What is it? What's happening?

51:04.160 --> 51:05.894
You're a go.

51:05.896 --> 51:08.532
When can you have these
fighters in the sky?

51:10.934 --> 51:14.269
We have all the space we'll need to
accommodate all the Nero tech gear

51:14.271 --> 51:15.970
we'll need to fit inside.

51:15.972 --> 51:18.074
Bastards won't know what hit 'em.

51:19.108 --> 51:20.774
[clapping]

51:20.776 --> 51:24.479
All right. Guys, don't start
high-fiving each other just yet.

51:24.481 --> 51:30.218
The entire interior has over 30,000
electrical parts and over 14 miles of wiring.

51:30.220 --> 51:32.820
And now we need to compress
all of that data management

51:32.822 --> 51:34.921
and operation into one pilot,

51:34.923 --> 51:38.795
who's not gonna flip one switch with
anything more than power of thought.

51:39.997 --> 51:42.233
We got a lot of work ahead of us.

51:48.137 --> 51:50.607
[rattling, clanging]

51:55.945 --> 51:57.979
So let's get to work.

51:57.981 --> 52:00.715
What about you Miss Harper?
What are your credentials?

52:00.717 --> 52:04.486
1700 flight hours and 208
carrier arrest landings.

52:04.488 --> 52:09.724
Deployed at the USS Harry Truman with
strike fighters, squadron three seven.

52:09.726 --> 52:13.731
Raging Bulls. My oldest
is stationed at NAS Oceana.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.233
Harper. Emma.

52:17.633 --> 52:19.367
First woman at the stick of the Hornet

52:19.369 --> 52:20.801
for the Blue Angels.

52:20.803 --> 52:22.736
That's what they keep telling me, sir.

52:22.738 --> 52:26.276
Impressive. Now you're innovating
our fleet for the modern age.

52:27.945 --> 52:29.776
A lot of men and women want
to fight for their country

52:29.778 --> 52:32.780
but are unable to do so because
they lack the use of their limbs.

52:32.782 --> 52:35.684
EMMA: I think that's
a little short-sighted.

52:35.686 --> 52:38.019
Well we're privileged to have you.

52:38.021 --> 52:40.088
Thanks. Now if we may,

52:40.090 --> 52:43.794
we've got a nest filled spores in
Joshua Tree that need to be wiped out.

52:46.363 --> 52:48.162
[jets soaring]

52:48.164 --> 52:52.035
- [thunder roars]
- [explosion]

52:56.238 --> 52:59.106
After picking up samples
NASA HQ issued an alert.

52:59.108 --> 53:03.977
Apparently one of these
things had babies of some kind.

53:03.979 --> 53:07.948
- Babies? It gave birth?
- That's what they're saying.

53:07.950 --> 53:13.521
Apparently it starts as some black ooze and
it evolves into living reacting organism.

53:13.523 --> 53:16.990
And another thing...

53:16.992 --> 53:20.762
The military has a new plan
for trying to beat these things.

53:20.764 --> 53:22.763
They're teaming up with DARPA.

53:22.765 --> 53:25.200
They're working on a new plane.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.102
What? Where?

53:27.104 --> 53:30.640
Tucson, Arizona. Emma is
finally getting her chance.

53:34.677 --> 53:37.912
Maybe they can use a guy like you.

53:37.914 --> 53:40.481
Maybe you for gotten how long
it's been since I've flown.

53:40.483 --> 53:42.983
So it's the kind of thing
someone forgets how to do?

53:42.985 --> 53:48.658
I figured someone with so many awards
and medals, it's like riding a bike.

53:50.227 --> 53:52.827
You've never been inside
the cockpit of a plane.

53:52.829 --> 53:57.198
And besides, the technology's changed
considerably since I've flown. It's...

53:57.200 --> 53:59.600
That's true but Emma designed it.

53:59.602 --> 54:02.106
I'm sure she'd be willing
to teach you how to use it.

54:04.240 --> 54:07.110
- I don't think I'm...
- You don't need to think.

54:09.012 --> 54:11.215
You just have to go.

Dad!

55:49.412 --> 55:51.680
- What are you doing here?
- Hi, sweetheart.

55:51.682 --> 55:53.648
I came to see you.

55:53.650 --> 55:56.218
Now, how are you going to fight
those things with that, huh?

55:56.220 --> 55:57.551
You said you're making a brain plane,

55:57.553 --> 55:59.687
I'd imagine something a little bigger.

55:59.689 --> 56:01.321
Ha. Cute.

Seriously, what are you doing here?

You drove all the way
out here from Crestline?

56:05.162 --> 56:07.331
I came out here to see you.

56:09.066 --> 56:11.399
Well, welcome to Project Neuro.

56:11.401 --> 56:14.336
This is what I've been working on.

56:14.338 --> 56:16.738
This is Freddie. he's one
of my engineers and a pilot.

Call me Ben.

56:25.414 --> 56:28.582
Emma here tells us you were
a pilot with the Air Force.

56:28.584 --> 56:32.054
Oh, yeah. 95th Fighter
Squad based out of Tyndall.

56:33.423 --> 56:35.890
- Badass.
- Well, we like to think so.

56:35.892 --> 56:39.160
Don't get him started. You're
gonna hear war stories all night.

56:39.162 --> 56:42.097
Eh. So. These little
boxes look a little tight.

56:42.099 --> 56:44.131
I mean, they're a little snug, huh?

56:44.133 --> 56:46.434
They were developed based
upon the cockpit dimensions

56:46.436 --> 56:49.072
of every Century Series aircraft.

56:50.872 --> 56:52.573
Come on. Let me show you around.

56:52.575 --> 56:54.444

Wow.

57:05.588 --> 57:07.687
We're going around the clock
to retrofit all of them,

57:07.689 --> 57:10.191
but this one in front
of you will be the first.

57:10.193 --> 57:12.926
We need to get one up in

57:14.530 --> 57:18.399
I mean, this is absolutely incredible.

you were building a plane. Huh.

57:25.441 --> 57:26.943
The brain plane.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.611
Well, I couldn't stand by
while the world was burning

57:30.613 --> 57:33.615
and you were conquering it all on your own.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.515
[Ben chuckles]

57:35.517 --> 57:37.251
I'm sorry.

57:37.253 --> 57:38.956

- No, please. Just...

57:44.593 --> 57:46.026
[sighing]

57:46.028 --> 57:47.463
I've been in denial.

57:49.164 --> 57:52.200
I know why you did this. I understand.

57:52.202 --> 57:54.202
After your crash,

57:54.204 --> 57:57.637
you actually had a chance
to come back and pursue this.

57:57.639 --> 58:00.877
But I wanted you to join the
stunt team for a couple of reasons.

58:02.546 --> 58:05.345
- And those were?
- Well...

58:05.347 --> 58:07.548
I wanted to see you back in a plane.

58:07.550 --> 58:11.486
And I was too scared to
ever get back in one myself.

58:11.488 --> 58:14.024
After my car accident,
then your mother died.

58:15.691 --> 58:19.461

depression, paranoia, claustrophobia.

58:19.463 --> 58:22.095
I couldn't even get into an elevator.

58:26.936 --> 58:29.338

58:31.439 --> 58:34.374
But while I couldn't
even imagine flying again.

58:34.376 --> 58:36.979
I missed it. Emma, I really missed it.

58:38.814 --> 58:40.715
And after seeing you up there,

58:40.717 --> 58:42.350
you're right.

58:42.352 --> 58:45.689
I was reliving it. All through you. Again.

58:47.456 --> 58:48.856
[sighing]

58:48.858 --> 58:52.093
When you walked away and
devoted your time to this,

58:52.095 --> 58:54.264
I wanted to discourage you.

58:55.398 --> 58:57.497
Because, well...

58:57.499 --> 59:02.102
I just couldn't imagine
seeing you not fly again.
