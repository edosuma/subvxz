WEBVTT

00:26.868 --> 00:29.556
Mm.

00:29.588 --> 00:30.708
Hm.

00:33.460 --> 00:37.364
- Yeah, it's lazy.
- It's not lazy,

00:37.396 --> 00:39.061
it just... it just doesn't work.

00:39.093 --> 00:40.885
- Mhm.
- That's so pedestrian,

00:40.917 --> 00:42.420
- the whole thing.
- Yeah.

00:42.452 --> 00:44.308
It sort of just reminds me
of like a basic

00:44.340 --> 00:45.908
primary color wheel, frankly.

00:45.940 --> 00:48.309
- In a hotel.
- It is the problem.

00:48.341 --> 00:50.996
The background
needs more complexity and...

00:51.028 --> 00:52.724
It's just... it's leaving me cold.

00:52.756 --> 00:55.317
It's not... I don't know anything
about the artist, I don't...

00:55.349 --> 00:56.820
- Yeah, yeah.
- Peter made that comment

00:56.853 --> 00:58.708
last month about controlling
competing forms

00:58.740 --> 01:00.917
in order to head off
awkward readings

01:00.949 --> 01:04.949
and she's done that by stripping
away everything interesting.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.308
- I'm... I'm done.
- Yeah.

01:08.340 --> 01:11.188
It's making
me a little bit angry.

01:13.140 --> 01:16.020
- I can see that.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:16.053 --> 01:18.101
- I think that's all for now.
- That's all we have to say.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.085
You know, better luck next time.

01:20.117 --> 01:24.404
- Any questions for us?
- No.

01:24.436 --> 01:27.380
I don't have any questions,
thank you.

02:14.101 --> 02:17.076
No, no, no, whoa!

03:07.028 --> 03:11.701
Okay,
so maybe I'm not an artist.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.868
Maybe I'm just the daughter
of two other artists.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.949
- What?
- You don't need to know...

03:16.980 --> 03:18.580
Frances,
will you get in here please?

03:18.612 --> 03:20.341
My father
started drawing animals

03:20.373 --> 03:22.229
in the style of Albrecht Dürer,

03:22.261 --> 03:24.789
then he drew flowers
for a vintage poster company,

03:24.821 --> 03:28.308
and finally trained
as a medical illustrator.

03:28.340 --> 03:31.060
He's illustrated
16 technical textbooks.

03:31.092 --> 03:35.765
Then you tell him to draw his
own fucking mitochondria. Fuck!

03:35.796 --> 03:36.820
But all he really wants

03:36.852 --> 03:40.181
is to draw an owl as convincing
as Albrecht Dürer's.

03:40.213 --> 03:42.516
My mother designs
upholstery textiles

03:42.548 --> 03:44.405
for three-story
Connecticut mansions

03:44.436 --> 03:46.805
but lives in a one-bedroom
Manhattan apartment

03:46.837 --> 03:50.997
where she sleeps with my father
on a pull-out sofa bed.

03:51.029 --> 03:55.188
Maybe success isn't really
an option for any of us.

03:55.220 --> 03:58.709
My family's apartment looks like
a Mondrian of claustrophobia.

03:58.741 --> 04:01.589
My parents' sofa bed
is the red rectangle,

04:01.621 --> 04:05.301
my sister and my old bunk beds
are the blue rectangle,

04:05.332 --> 04:07.540
and the fire escape
is the yellow,

04:07.572 --> 04:11.316
which is the only rectangle
where anybody can breathe.

04:11.347 --> 04:13.363
Ah-ha.

04:13.396 --> 04:16.116
Hey, hi.

04:16.147 --> 04:18.869
Fran, I've had such a crazy day.

04:18.901 --> 04:21.971
- Yeah, me too.
- Come here.

04:27.636 --> 04:31.317
Aren't you supposed
to be at Robert's?

04:31.349 --> 04:34.356
- Yes.
- Well, what are you doing home?

04:34.387 --> 04:36.757
Did something happen?

04:36.789 --> 04:39.669
We broke up.

04:42.389 --> 04:45.141
Mh, I'm sorry.

04:50.037 --> 04:51.349
Your mother's driving me crazy.

04:51.381 --> 04:54.389
Levi, don't talk about me!

04:54.421 --> 04:56.341
- Really crazy.
- Hey, Dad.

04:56.373 --> 04:58.325
What happened to you?

04:58.356 --> 05:01.205
That's a really nice way
to say hello to somebody.

05:01.236 --> 05:03.861
I thought you were
at Robert's lake house.

05:03.892 --> 05:06.676
Yeah, well, when you
break up with someone,

05:06.709 --> 05:09.461
it's not really very fun to go
swimming with them anymore.

05:09.493 --> 05:11.189
What, he dumped you?

05:11.220 --> 05:15.636
- How was your time?
- They broke up.

05:15.667 --> 05:18.196
- And look at this here.
- He dumped you?

05:18.229 --> 05:19.957
Why is that the assumption here

05:19.989 --> 05:22.197
with both of you right away?

05:22.229 --> 05:23.700
I assumed that you dumped him.

05:23.733 --> 05:25.363
That's kind, thank you, Gaby.

05:25.397 --> 05:28.597
- You knew about this?
- Ow, ow, hey, fuck!

05:28.629 --> 05:31.636
Just relax, your energy is...

05:31.669 --> 05:33.365
You can't live in
this apartment anymore.

05:33.397 --> 05:34.836
- Now what are you gonna do?
- Well, actually

05:34.867 --> 05:36.597
I'm still waiting on
the Tokyo residency, so...

05:36.629 --> 05:38.549
Well,
I told you you should've done that

05:38.581 --> 05:39.829
from the beginning, you know?

05:39.861 --> 05:41.236
Can you get out
of the way, please?

05:41.269 --> 05:42.709
There isn't
anywhere for me to go.

05:42.741 --> 05:44.020
- Go over here, I mean.
- Stop it, don't move.

05:44.053 --> 05:45.205
- What is that?
- Me?

05:45.237 --> 05:47.604
- You have a leech.
- No.

05:47.637 --> 05:50.227
You have a leech,
you have a leech, come, come.

05:50.260 --> 05:53.045
Come here, all right,
go right to the sink.

05:53.076 --> 05:55.861
What did I tell you
about that lake?

05:55.892 --> 05:57.109
That's disgusting.

05:57.141 --> 05:59.924
Tokyo will never work
out, Fran.

05:59.957 --> 06:02.645
Levi,
stop being so hard on Frances.

06:02.676 --> 06:05.205
All right, all right,
forget I said anything.

06:05.236 --> 06:07.860
- Get the blanket, please.
- What's gonna happen?

06:07.893 --> 06:09.557
Someone should
sleep on this thing.

06:09.588 --> 06:11.541
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it, do it.

06:11.573 --> 06:13.717
Oh!

06:13.749 --> 06:16.116
I'm feeling
mildly optimistic, Fran.

06:16.147 --> 06:18.197
I'm sure Tokyo will work out.

06:20.629 --> 06:24.245
Okay. Oh, Frances,

06:24.277 --> 06:26.389
they picked the nicest tush
in New York.

06:26.421 --> 06:29.109
You're done, beauty.

06:29.140 --> 06:31.829
You can pull them up.

06:31.860 --> 06:34.484
- What did I tell you?
- So sorry, hon.

06:34.517 --> 06:37.141
Yeah, well,
you wanna see something really tragic?

06:37.172 --> 06:41.045
Look at this piece of crap.

06:41.076 --> 06:43.701
- Oh, did you draw that?
- Did I dr...

06:43.732 --> 06:45.077
Of course I didn't
draw that, how can you

06:45.108 --> 06:46.357
even fucking think that?

06:46.389 --> 06:48.180
It looks like
a fucking rigatoni.

06:48.213 --> 06:49.716
I should never
have suggested it.

06:49.747 --> 06:50.901
Well, here,
here, let me show you.

06:50.933 --> 06:53.877
This is mine.

06:53.909 --> 06:56.597
- It's gorgeous.
- What is that?

06:56.628 --> 06:58.484
What do you have on your hand?

06:58.517 --> 07:00.564
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

07:00.597 --> 07:03.605
- Oh my God.
- What's going on? Mirela?

07:03.637 --> 07:05.845
- He asked you?
- He did.

07:05.876 --> 07:07.444
- What's going on?
- Oh my God.

07:07.477 --> 07:09.589
I'm engaged!

07:09.621 --> 07:11.380
I am engaged.

07:11.413 --> 07:13.109
To Scott Glenny.

07:13.140 --> 07:15.541
We were on the
Staten Island Ferry

07:15.572 --> 07:17.429
to go meet up with
his parents for dinner.

07:17.461 --> 07:20.884
And I was kind of posing

07:20.917 --> 07:22.229
like the Statue of Liberty,

07:22.261 --> 07:24.085
just like as a joke,
and I turn around

07:24.116 --> 07:27.317
and he had this little box out

07:27.348 --> 07:29.845
and he just asked.

07:29.876 --> 07:33.077
And we're getting married.

07:33.108 --> 07:36.469
Well, that's good because
your mother and I are separating.

07:40.276 --> 07:41.588
- What?
- It's good,

07:41.621 --> 07:43.221
because you'll be
out of the house...

07:43.252 --> 07:45.428
well, actually,
there won't be a house,

07:45.461 --> 07:47.444
and, Frances,
the same goes for you.

07:47.477 --> 07:49.364
- Levi!
- Well...

07:49.397 --> 07:52.148
- Mom?
- You know, the cat's out.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.869
- Mom?
- Congratulations.

07:57.941 --> 08:00.629
Where are they gonna go?

08:00.661 --> 08:03.157
I can't really tell

08:03.189 --> 08:05.844
how much of a plan there is,

08:05.877 --> 08:08.724
more than all of the feelings.

08:11.156 --> 08:13.364
I didn't think they were
actually gonna do it, Fran.

08:16.660 --> 08:20.981
I bet there was a time
where he really blew her away.

08:27.989 --> 08:32.085
Do you...
do you think that love can last?

08:43.092 --> 08:44.469
Fran?

08:47.061 --> 08:50.004
Yeah, and how is Scott
Glenny gonna support her?

08:50.037 --> 08:52.469
She's in law school,
Dad, she's gonna support herself.

08:52.501 --> 08:55.220
Yeah, well,
she clearly doesn't see his essence.

08:55.252 --> 08:58.229
Scott Glenny is a schmuck.

08:58.261 --> 09:01.076
Okay? I know about this
and I know how it's gonna end.

09:03.157 --> 09:05.909
Man, I've missed this place.

09:05.941 --> 09:09.044
Yeah, it's gonna be nice
having you here this summer.

09:09.077 --> 09:12.021
Oh, and look, this whole wall,
that's all for you.

09:12.053 --> 09:15.701
It's very nice light.

09:15.732 --> 09:18.677
Well, it... well, you know.

09:18.708 --> 09:21.396
We'll adjust.

09:51.062 --> 09:54.357
There we go, we'll move it...
we'll just move it a little.

09:54.388 --> 09:56.181
Okay, I don't need my bed yet.

09:56.213 --> 09:57.876
What? Our bed.

09:57.908 --> 10:00.469
I'm gonna be staying in
the studio for a little while.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.812
Which side do you want?

10:03.701 --> 10:05.877
- Norway.
- Norway?

10:05.908 --> 10:07.508
Actual Norway?

10:07.541 --> 10:10.421
Well, it's not
exactly Tokyo, but...

10:10.452 --> 10:11.797
it doesn't sound so bad.

10:11.829 --> 10:14.101
Norway is not the problem.

10:14.133 --> 10:16.148
What is the problem?

10:16.181 --> 10:18.740
- Nils Auermann.
- Nils Auermann.

10:18.772 --> 10:20.244
I thought he was dead.

10:20.277 --> 10:21.620
Only to the people that matter.

10:21.652 --> 10:23.636
He just fired
his last assistant,

10:23.670 --> 10:26.037
now he needs someone
to paint a barn

10:26.068 --> 10:28.053
using only the color yellow.

10:30.037 --> 10:31.637
Okay, that's fine.

10:31.668 --> 10:35.060
I would just like
to get out of here.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.141
Do you think I'll have time
to do my own work in Oslo...

10:37.173 --> 10:39.860
Not Oslo, Lofoten.

10:39.892 --> 10:42.388
Lofoten.

10:42.420 --> 10:45.460
Islands in the far north.

10:45.493 --> 10:47.957
How far north?

11:43.572 --> 11:45.333
Mr. Auermann?

11:47.381 --> 11:48.949
- I'm Frances.
- Nils.

11:48.980 --> 11:51.829
Hey, thank you.

11:55.252 --> 11:57.204
I'm so happy to meet you.

12:11.956 --> 12:14.388
I'm very eager
to see what you've done

12:14.421 --> 12:17.781
in this project so far.

12:28.117 --> 12:31.476
Everyone here seems
really friendly.

12:35.412 --> 12:40.021
It's so beautiful,
it's almost like a bad painting.

12:40.053 --> 12:42.676
What I mean is...
is that it's so beautiful,

12:42.710 --> 12:45.108
that it looks like a painting
that you would make...

12:45.141 --> 12:47.766
Not you, but... certainly
not you at all.

12:47.796 --> 12:49.044
But if you tried
to make a painting of it,

12:49.077 --> 12:51.316
it would almost be like cheesy?

12:56.820 --> 12:59.541
So magical that
the sun never sets.

12:59.572 --> 13:01.461
The light is astounding.

13:01.492 --> 13:03.221
Oh, look at that.

13:03.252 --> 13:06.164
I have never seen
a landscape so powerful.

13:06.196 --> 13:07.988
Yet you've never
really done landscapes,

13:08.021 --> 13:10.836
and I also just wanna say
I loved your early work.

13:10.868 --> 13:13.140
It's like everything is such a...

13:19.093 --> 13:21.396
Such a miracle to have
so many different colors,

13:21.428 --> 13:22.964
I would want to write them down.

13:22.997 --> 13:25.141
I really would, because
it seems like they're...

13:59.061 --> 14:01.077
Don't step in the middle.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.828
The wood is rotten.

14:13.492 --> 14:15.508
What's with all the trash?

14:15.540 --> 14:18.420
It's not trash, I recycle.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.380
Toilet.

14:23.414 --> 14:27.157
Shower.

14:27.188 --> 14:29.781
Clean bedsheets, towels.

14:29.812 --> 14:34.069
The rest of the house
is off limits.

14:34.101 --> 14:35.190
Understand?

14:35.221 --> 14:37.941
Yes.

14:37.973 --> 14:39.829
It used to be
an old fish factory,

14:39.861 --> 14:41.620
now it's for artists.

14:41.654 --> 14:46.004
- How many artists live here?
- Me.

14:46.036 --> 14:48.180
So...

14:48.212 --> 14:51.764
this is yours.

14:51.796 --> 14:54.580
Sleeping, cooking,
everything you need.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.380
- Well...
- It's an honor to be here.

15:02.133 --> 15:05.013
It's an honor
to be here with you!

15:35.220 --> 15:37.108
Nils Auermann's
work has been called

15:37.140 --> 15:39.605
the same bad names
as mine:

15:39.636 --> 15:42.997
lazy, cold, not working.

15:45.301 --> 15:47.925
So this is where you go
when you're exiled.

15:47.957 --> 15:50.196
To the edge of the earth.

15:50.228 --> 15:52.789
You go to Arctic detention.

15:52.821 --> 15:56.790
To some buried asleep
in the sun detention.

16:15.156 --> 16:17.396
Ugh.

16:28.341 --> 16:31.508
We're leaving in ten minutes!

16:41.941 --> 16:45.076
Hi, um, sorry,
that trailer of yours

16:45.108 --> 16:47.220
could really use
some thicker curtains.

16:47.252 --> 16:49.140
Please do not ask me
about the sleeping, okay?

16:49.172 --> 16:52.277
It's very bright
at night for sleeping.

16:52.309 --> 16:53.397
Can you work?

16:53.429 --> 16:56.053
I can.

17:07.829 --> 17:11.381
- What?
- The Viking Museum.

17:20.531 --> 17:22.675
Oh, okay, here we go.

18:00.469 --> 18:04.916
Your official
title will be apprentice.

18:04.949 --> 18:06.836
It's amazing to be
your apprentice.

18:06.869 --> 18:08.756
Do not use... do not..

18:08.789 --> 18:10.837
Do not use
the word "amazing", okay?

18:10.869 --> 18:14.645
This is just hard work,
you're gonna hate it.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.757
Cool.

18:21.461 --> 18:25.109
So you will be responsible

18:25.141 --> 18:27.989
for the interior.

18:28.021 --> 18:32.596
You can use this wall
as an example, okay?

18:32.628 --> 18:35.157
Here you have buckets,
also with numbers.

18:35.189 --> 18:38.005
So use that bucket
for that beam and so on, okay?

18:38.037 --> 18:38.901
- Yeah.
- You got that?

18:38.932 --> 18:40.404
- Mhm.
- Good.

18:40.437 --> 18:44.020
I will do the exterior.

18:44.052 --> 18:46.805
In one month the piece
will be inspected by NKI,

18:46.836 --> 18:49.141
that's the Norwegian
Art Institute.

18:49.173 --> 18:51.541
If they like the piece,
they put me on the map.

18:51.573 --> 18:54.676
- Put ya on the map.
- Yeah, they put me on the map.

18:54.708 --> 18:57.941
Oh, like an actual map.

19:00.117 --> 19:03.701
I need you to paint full time.

19:03.733 --> 19:07.925
I'd like to do a little
of my own work this summer.

19:07.956 --> 19:11.189
Not what I hired you for.

19:11.220 --> 19:13.045
Well, it's what I came here for.

19:13.077 --> 19:15.541
Look, this is not
some kind of residency, okay?

19:15.573 --> 19:17.588
From seven to seven, we work.

19:19.860 --> 19:23.540
Is there a place where
I can paint at eight?

19:43.413 --> 19:47.189
Nils' project was
essentially a giant color-by-numbers.

19:47.221 --> 19:49.717
It was a coloring book
and I, of course,

19:49.749 --> 19:54.036
was always more
of a finger painter.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.469
So this would be Nils'
work and Nils' battle,

19:56.501 --> 19:59.189
not mine.

19:59.220 --> 20:01.780
Fine, I can be a soldier.

21:12.501 --> 21:14.037
Hi.

21:22.420 --> 21:29.364
Go that way.

21:29.397 --> 21:37.237
Go down, go down.

22:16.341 --> 22:19.701
Oh, and the light
must be beautiful all the time.

22:19.732 --> 22:21.845
It is constant all the time.

22:21.876 --> 22:23.765
And are you lonely?

22:23.796 --> 22:25.300
I'm closed for business.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.349
You're very attractive to men.

22:27.381 --> 22:29.940
That's not
even a useful statement.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.637
Oh, come on, enjoy yourself.

22:31.668 --> 22:33.460
- Really?
- This is when your body

22:33.493 --> 22:35.797
- is really at its best.
- This is not what I want

22:35.829 --> 22:38.517
- to talk about.
- Don't shy away from that, Fran.

22:38.549 --> 22:40.597
I want you to feel good
about yourself.

22:40.629 --> 22:42.741
You look like
you've changed a little.

22:42.772 --> 22:44.947
What are you eating,
you look very thin.

22:44.980 --> 22:47.669
I eat a lot of brown cheese,

22:47.701 --> 22:50.516
and you put it on a little...
like a cracker, like a...

22:50.549 --> 22:54.356
- That sounds so unappealing.
- It's just what it is.

23:45.428 --> 23:49.397
A kitten named "Rambo"
rescued another kitten

23:49.428 --> 23:52.789
on a farm near Tangstad.

23:56.756 --> 24:00.436
- That's what it says?
- Yeah.

24:00.469 --> 24:03.285
His name is Rambo.

24:24.117 --> 24:26.069
What is that?

24:26.100 --> 24:29.492
Yeah, yeah, that's super fine.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.253
Thanks for the wine.

25:51.669 --> 25:55.124
Fuck.

26:20.981 --> 26:22.997
- Can we pick him up?
- Pick who up?

26:23.028 --> 26:24.404
- The...
- You're severely behind

26:24.436 --> 26:26.676
today's work, you're a disaster.

26:33.237 --> 26:35.989
You know, we can go to town
for supplies later.

26:38.101 --> 26:42.837
Tonight, I'm cooking
the secret recipe of my mother.

26:42.870 --> 26:46.260
Good for you.

26:46.293 --> 26:48.148
You may join me

26:48.180 --> 26:50.997
in the upstairs kitchen.

26:51.028 --> 26:53.781
Oh, wow!

26:56.020 --> 26:58.708
Sarcasm doesn't suit you.

27:28.053 --> 27:30.901
Oh! Hi.

27:33.428 --> 27:35.637
You work in here?

27:37.972 --> 27:40.020
She looked like
the all-powerful angel

27:40.053 --> 27:41.748
who ruled the Renaissance

27:41.781 --> 27:44.084
and she lived in
the most wide-open place

27:44.116 --> 27:45.844
I'd ever imagined or been to.

27:45.877 --> 27:48.404
But somehow,
she worked in a black cube

27:48.437 --> 27:52.437
as cramped as
my father's studio.

27:52.468 --> 27:56.116
Did she feel like
she was in detention too?

27:56.148 --> 27:57.781
Or maybe I was
just seeing it that way

27:57.813 --> 28:00.726
because I was looking for
a partner in punishment.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.189
You have the wrong cheese.

28:07.221 --> 28:10.197
This one is wrong.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.508
How is that wrong?

28:11.541 --> 28:14.101
I want the green milk, yeah.

28:35.828 --> 28:40.116
I wouldn't be close
to finishing this in time

28:40.148 --> 28:41.877
if you weren't here, you know.

28:44.596 --> 28:49.396
Yeah, that's right,
you wouldn't.

28:49.430 --> 28:52.437
Can you tell me
a little bit about

28:52.470 --> 28:54.357
your work in New York?

30:09.301 --> 30:11.286
Wrong.

31:01.013 --> 31:03.797
Beautiful colors.

31:11.828 --> 31:14.421
Sorry, just English.

31:14.453 --> 31:16.884
Oh, you're the New Yorker?

31:16.916 --> 31:18.741
I must be.

31:18.772 --> 31:20.788
That's a big barn
to paint in a short time.

31:20.820 --> 31:22.901
- Yeah.
- I've been excited to meet you.

31:22.933 --> 31:24.628
- Haldor says...
- Haldor says what?

31:26.869 --> 31:30.068
This is Haldor,
he plays the chief.

31:30.100 --> 31:33.300
- I am the chief.
- Sorry.

31:33.332 --> 31:36.630
Where are you from?

31:36.661 --> 31:38.676
Cincinnati.

31:38.708 --> 31:42.485
And you
prefer life as a Viking?

31:42.516 --> 31:43.508
Well,
I can tell by your attitude

31:43.540 --> 31:45.524
you wouldn't understand.

31:45.556 --> 31:48.885
What is this here?

31:48.917 --> 31:50.837
- What is it?
- That's urine.

31:50.869 --> 31:52.981
- Gosh, it really is.
- The Vikings used this

31:53.013 --> 31:55.444
mushroom mix as tinder

31:55.478 --> 31:57.108
when it's dry.

31:57.141 --> 31:58.677
Ah, I see.

31:58.710 --> 32:02.325
Have you inspected our grounds?

32:02.357 --> 32:04.149
They're quite remarkable.

32:04.181 --> 32:05.844
It's a relief
to be inside of a place

32:05.876 --> 32:08.181
that really knows what it is.

32:08.213 --> 32:10.644
Like, there's a lot of, um,

32:10.676 --> 32:12.085
there's a lot of here, here.

32:12.117 --> 32:15.061
A place?

32:15.093 --> 32:16.885
This is history.

32:16.917 --> 32:20.565
Oh, I'm... thank you so much.

32:20.597 --> 32:23.349
See you.

32:23.381 --> 32:25.301
I am the chief.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.421
- Sorry.
- I've devoted my life

32:26.453 --> 32:28.118
to all this.

32:28.149 --> 32:29.908
I don't call you Chuck.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.588
Haldor looked
like the Dutch postmen

32:33.620 --> 32:35.861
who are more beard than face.

32:35.893 --> 32:38.837
Sigbjorn looked like
a newborn baby.

32:38.869 --> 32:42.996
I wanted to tell him, at least,
the words I had learned.

33:47.093 --> 33:50.965
This project is too important
to just walk away like that.

33:50.997 --> 33:54.645
You have to learn to take
your art seriously, Frances.

33:54.677 --> 33:56.501
The museum is just there, okay?

33:56.533 --> 33:57.908
It's a neighbor.

33:57.940 --> 34:00.948
I cannot afford to find
you over there.

34:00.980 --> 34:03.221
This barn is like
a cathedral to me.

34:03.253 --> 34:06.997
If you cannot respect
that simple premise then...

34:07.029 --> 34:10.069
No, no, no, this is not
how I showed you!

34:10.101 --> 34:13.781
Follow the grain!

34:13.813 --> 34:15.315
I am following the grain.

34:19.092 --> 34:21.717
Minor painter,
you have buckets,

34:21.748 --> 34:23.860
you have numbers.

34:23.891 --> 34:25.364
An idiot could do this.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.349
- You have to taper.
- I'm tapering.

34:27.380 --> 34:29.268
You're not tapering, okay?
Come on.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.804
- Ow!
- This is tapering.

34:30.837 --> 34:33.237
- Let go, let go!
- You are not following

34:33.268 --> 34:36.245
- clear directions.
- Don't touch me!

34:36.275 --> 34:40.021
I don't care,
do not touch me ever.

34:40.053 --> 34:41.108
Where are you going?

34:41.139 --> 34:44.179
Out. I'm done.

35:02.997 --> 35:05.045
Uhh...

35:07.413 --> 35:10.357
Uh, may I have
the blueberry one?

35:24.532 --> 35:26.549
Next.

35:26.580 --> 35:31.188
- Uh, one pancake.
- Toppings?

35:31.220 --> 35:33.205
- No.
- Okay.

35:36.980 --> 35:39.541
Are you from around here?

35:42.261 --> 35:45.109
Do I know you?

35:47.476 --> 35:49.589
What?

35:49.620 --> 35:51.701
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:08.596 --> 36:12.149
He looked like Caravaggio's
Boy with a Basket of Fruit.

36:14.069 --> 36:17.525
Heavy eyes, heavy arms

36:17.557 --> 36:19.765
just no fruit.

37:24.916 --> 37:29.941
You know,
you and I are opposites, Frances.

37:29.972 --> 37:32.725
I'm not used to people.

37:32.757 --> 37:34.003
Especially not teaching.

37:37.077 --> 37:40.276
But you know,

37:40.309 --> 37:42.997
we complement one another.

37:43.029 --> 37:45.269
My orange to your blue.

37:49.109 --> 37:53.107
Blue and orange
are complementary colors.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.861
If you look at something orange,
a piece of paper

37:55.892 --> 38:00.084
for like 15 seconds and
then look at a white paper,

38:00.117 --> 38:02.901
your eye makes blue.

38:02.933 --> 38:07.764
It's the same with
yellow and violet.

38:07.797 --> 38:10.740
I use yellow and red
when I want violet,

38:10.773 --> 38:12.820
you know?

38:12.853 --> 38:15.989
So it is living.

38:22.229 --> 38:23.765
It is living.

38:29.461 --> 38:31.637
At this rate,
we definitely make our schedule.

38:31.668 --> 38:33.301
Your schedule is for
wimps, I'm gonna finish this

38:33.332 --> 38:34.581
one a week early.

38:36.853 --> 38:38.740
- What?
- It's the accent.

38:38.773 --> 38:41.364
- What...
- I cook you anything you like.

38:41.397 --> 38:44.340
No more brown cheese.

38:44.373 --> 38:46.997
Okay.

38:55.189 --> 38:56.628
Stop.

38:56.661 --> 38:59.029
Stop.

39:01.876 --> 39:03.444
- We need to work.
- I have to see something,

39:03.477 --> 39:06.805
but I'll be right behind you.

39:37.492 --> 39:38.868
Hey there.

39:38.901 --> 39:40.565
Hey.

39:40.596 --> 39:42.548
Hello?

39:42.581 --> 39:44.628
I think I realized
where I met you.

39:44.661 --> 39:46.517
I'm pretty good with faces,
I'd say,

39:46.548 --> 39:48.341
and I'm feeling very confident

39:48.372 --> 39:52.244
that you sold me
a sandwich in Brooklyn.

39:52.277 --> 39:53.397
I doubt it.

39:58.260 --> 40:00.948
- What are you doing here?
- What are <i>you</i> doing here?

40:03.220 --> 40:06.900
I'm painting a barn.

40:06.933 --> 40:09.045
Oh,
I see the two of you have met.

40:09.076 --> 40:12.660
Who is this lovely person?

40:12.693 --> 40:14.740
He's here
because he understands the...

40:14.773 --> 40:17.204
the real value
of a Viking funeral

40:17.237 --> 40:18.484
for his father.

40:20.917 --> 40:22.164
I'm sorry.

40:23.732 --> 40:25.365
I'm really sorry.

40:25.396 --> 40:27.637
I didn't realize.

40:27.668 --> 40:29.588
- Yeah.
- Perhaps Frances can help us

40:29.621 --> 40:31.541
with your father's ceremony.

40:31.572 --> 40:33.045
No, she doesn't need to help.

40:35.029 --> 40:38.709
Well, we're all here to help
in any way.

40:38.740 --> 40:39.829
Also, another member
of your party

40:39.860 --> 40:42.101
has just arrived.

40:42.132 --> 40:43.926
There are no other members.

40:48.532 --> 40:51.285
Was your father Norwegian?

40:51.316 --> 40:52.884
No, he was Russian.

40:54.612 --> 40:56.116
Just wanted to die here.

41:00.116 --> 41:02.388
I mean, he...

41:02.421 --> 41:04.693
he wanted to rest here.

41:05.780 --> 41:07.829
These all go back.

41:12.821 --> 41:15.476
You're at the wrong funeral.

41:16.661 --> 41:19.701
I wish that were true.

41:19.733 --> 41:24.437
The family of the deceased
isn't expecting any more guests.

41:24.468 --> 41:25.780
Okay?

41:28.437 --> 41:31.444
You're such a strong man.

41:33.620 --> 41:35.796
How high can you jump?

41:39.542 --> 41:43.637
Pretty, uh... pretty high.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.004
Show me.

41:58.037 --> 42:00.404
Bravo.

42:00.436 --> 42:02.997
Go tell my son I am here.

42:03.028 --> 42:04.533
His name is Yakov.

42:06.292 --> 42:08.310
I think your
dad is going to find it

42:08.341 --> 42:12.085
to be really quite peaceful
all the way up here.

42:14.421 --> 42:16.244
It's a really nice place to be.

42:18.197 --> 42:20.725
- To be?
- Mm.

42:20.756 --> 42:22.004
Yeah.

42:31.860 --> 42:33.205
Thanks.

42:35.157 --> 42:37.844
Have you seen
the rest of this museum?

42:37.876 --> 42:38.900
There's more?

42:48.630 --> 42:50.868
So what brings you
all the way up here?

42:52.788 --> 42:55.957
Can't really be a barn.

42:55.989 --> 42:57.557
It's mostly the barn.

43:00.150 --> 43:02.869
And a breakup.

43:02.900 --> 43:04.468
And my sister getting married
to a man

43:04.500 --> 43:06.388
that my parents hate
and my parents splitting up.

43:06.420 --> 43:11.444
So just general mess.

43:11.476 --> 43:13.590
So painting
is an escape mechanism.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.470
No.

43:16.501 --> 43:19.541
Painting is focus.

43:19.572 --> 43:22.804
I think the love stuff
was an escape

43:22.837 --> 43:25.397
from the painting.

43:28.148 --> 43:29.588
I get that.

43:33.717 --> 43:35.540
I'm sorry about your dad.

43:40.213 --> 43:41.877
I'm sorry about your mess.

43:43.572 --> 43:45.844
Yakov.

43:45.877 --> 43:47.125
Listen.

43:47.157 --> 43:49.110
- Yes?
- Uh, could you please...

43:49.141 --> 43:51.381
What? What is it?

43:51.412 --> 43:52.756
Your mother.

44:01.460 --> 44:04.276
You froze him?

44:04.309 --> 44:05.621
No, I chilled him.

44:16.308 --> 44:18.837
Vassily Grigoriev.

44:20.981 --> 44:23.670
His heart went out.

44:32.948 --> 44:34.356
He's free.

44:37.973 --> 44:41.781
Here lies a free, dead man.

44:45.172 --> 44:46.645
Let us go.

45:06.388 --> 45:09.717
His eyes fell somewhere
new on the blue spectrum,

45:09.750 --> 45:14.421
a kind of alien, cosmos,
deep sea, gas flame blue

45:14.453 --> 45:15.988
I'd never seen before.

45:21.333 --> 45:23.061
I asked him what he did.

45:27.508 --> 45:29.877
He'd grown up working
in his father's bakery.

45:36.469 --> 45:38.836
Every day, he'd woken up earlier

45:38.868 --> 45:42.421
and completed more craft
than any artist I'd ever met.

45:43.668 --> 45:45.524
He knew what he was doing.

45:45.556 --> 45:47.957
His work was his calling.

45:47.989 --> 45:49.396
I envied that.

45:53.428 --> 45:55.605
He said his father
had raised him,

45:55.637 --> 45:58.964
first in Russia,
then in Brighton Beach.

45:58.996 --> 46:01.908
They'd waited ten years
for his mother to join them

46:01.941 --> 46:03.188
and she never did.

46:04.373 --> 46:06.964
He said that losing his father

46:06.997 --> 46:08.917
was like losing his own life.

46:37.173 --> 46:38.677
Hi.

46:38.708 --> 46:42.580
I would like to paint you.

46:42.614 --> 46:44.340
Okay.

46:44.372 --> 46:46.388
- Really?
- Let's go.

46:55.796 --> 46:58.197
Maybe we start by the bed?

47:07.956 --> 47:10.517
So... okay...

47:12.116 --> 47:14.517
- On the bed?
- Yeah.

50:17.749 --> 50:20.405
Not now, after. Hey!

50:20.437 --> 50:22.196
Shh! Not now.

50:26.772 --> 50:31.061
Vassily Andreyevich Grigoriev

50:31.093 --> 50:36.661
asked to be given
to the top of the world

50:36.693 --> 50:37.877
after death.

50:43.573 --> 50:46.836
"Then spake Gangleri,

50:46.868 --> 50:50.229
'Shall any of the gods
live then,

50:50.261 --> 50:52.628
or shall there be then
any earth...'"

50:52.660 --> 50:54.869
- Haldor, could we just...
- "'or heaven...'"

50:57.396 --> 50:59.443
- Please, allow me.
- What are you doing?

50:59.476 --> 51:01.428
I'm actually the
only Norwegian person here.

51:01.460 --> 51:03.797
You are the
person to play the flute.

51:03.829 --> 51:07.028
- And you are a tour guide.
- My dad...

51:11.669 --> 51:14.421
My dad was the only family
I ever had.

51:15.828 --> 51:17.620
It was good to be with him.

51:19.093 --> 51:21.909
I lived with him
for my whole life

51:21.941 --> 51:24.917
and I worked with him
as long as I can remember.

51:26.837 --> 51:30.068
He was a baker.

51:30.100 --> 51:32.757
And his favorite bagel
was the sesame bagel.

51:37.077 --> 51:39.157
He was made of peace.

51:41.301 --> 51:44.277
And it's good that we're here,

51:44.309 --> 51:46.452
giving him what he wanted.

51:50.037 --> 51:51.701
Which was to find more peace.

51:56.340 --> 51:58.453
I thank you for that.

52:03.636 --> 52:05.877
That's all I wanted to say.

52:08.149 --> 52:11.829
There is a Hebrew
prayer we should say.

52:11.861 --> 52:15.220
I learned it from
my father's funeral.

52:15.252 --> 52:21.749
I do not remember
how to say it.

52:27.349 --> 52:30.516
- You say "amen" now.
- Amen.

52:40.147 --> 52:42.229
- Amen.
- Amen.

54:34.581 --> 54:39.317
Being next to Yasha
in his moment of total feeling,

54:39.348 --> 54:42.741
I could see us there
inside of an image of loss,

54:42.772 --> 54:44.821
an image I hadn't painted.

54:44.852 --> 54:46.741
One that I had
walked right into.

54:48.948 --> 54:52.501
There was no work we could do
to improve anything.

54:52.532 --> 54:54.900
We could only be there.

55:00.533 --> 55:02.517
I don't recognize any of this.

55:13.269 --> 55:15.029
Do you know where we're going?

55:21.109 --> 55:23.316
Sure.

55:23.348 --> 55:24.885
Yeah.

55:24.916 --> 55:27.188
It's, um...

55:27.221 --> 55:28.085
Great.

56:40.629 --> 56:42.324
I've gotta get to work.

56:44.373 --> 56:45.556
Shirt.

57:00.757 --> 57:02.101
Okay.

57:40.692 --> 57:42.389
Your eye is sharpening.

57:44.980 --> 57:46.517
I started to
understand that the barn

57:46.548 --> 57:48.116
was not paint by numbers

57:48.149 --> 57:50.388
but that it was
a whole geometry.

57:50.421 --> 57:52.468
We were using the minor angles
of sundials

57:52.500 --> 57:54.101
and the unit grids
of graphing

57:54.132 --> 57:56.277
to build a kind
of monochrome mosaic.

57:58.612 --> 58:02.260
And it was also my monument
to my detention

58:02.293 --> 58:05.430
to this place that made work
feel worth doing.

58:12.660 --> 58:14.900
Have you been able
to do your own work?

58:16.500 --> 58:20.660
Uh... trying to, a little bit.

58:20.692 --> 58:23.605
I'd like to see
some of your pieces.

58:23.636 --> 58:26.516
After the inspection tomorrow.

58:30.708 --> 58:33.588
Tonight, I have to complete
the paperwork.

58:33.621 --> 58:36.276
You finish up
for the inspection.

58:36.308 --> 58:38.037
Are you kidding?

58:38.070 --> 58:40.917
Like my mother,
I'm never kidding.

58:53.300 --> 58:54.772
Hey.

58:56.597 --> 58:59.190
Hey.

58:59.221 --> 59:02.324
I wanted to
talk to you about, um...

59:02.357 --> 59:05.141
I'm leaving, tomorrow.

59:10.101 --> 59:12.981
Well...

59:13.012 --> 59:15.157
this is amazing.

59:15.189 --> 59:20.180
You have an incredible
sense of... color and air.

59:28.852 --> 59:32.021
Where is Nils tonight?

59:32.052 --> 59:36.148
He's, um... drinking.

59:36.180 --> 59:39.060
Probably, uh,
drinking and praying.

59:39.093 --> 59:41.621
Our inspection is tomorrow

59:41.652 --> 59:48.276
and he got so nervous
that he decided

59:48.308 --> 59:49.909
to leave me in charge.

59:49.940 --> 59:51.508
Unthinkable.

59:56.021 --> 59:57.717
You think it'll pass?

01:00:00.052 --> 01:00:03.124
I don't know, what do you think?

01:00:03.157 --> 01:00:04.533
Yeah.

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:10.868
It should pass.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.341
- Nils, I'm so sorry.
- We're leaving.

01:02:34.293 --> 01:02:36.468
Since when does an
artist like Nils Auermann

01:02:36.501 --> 01:02:39.125
give a crap about
what anyone thinks?

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:41.588
Today meant everything to him

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:44.629
and I made a huge mess.

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:47.796
No, I... I... I get it.
You know what a huge mess is?

01:02:47.828 --> 01:02:49.365
I don't know, that you
and Mom are splitting up

01:02:49.397 --> 01:02:51.861
so that you can now proceed
to die alone?

01:02:51.892 --> 01:02:52.724
No.

01:02:52.756 --> 01:02:54.165
Your sister's wedding.

01:02:54.197 --> 01:02:55.924
Here, look at this.

01:02:55.957 --> 01:02:59.190
September 22nd
at the Bowery Hotel.

01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:01.396
I RSVP'd no.

01:03:01.428 --> 01:03:03.508
I see Scott Glenny clearly.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.188
I've never seen anybody
more clearly in my life.

01:05:15.028 --> 01:05:16.724
Yeah.

01:05:16.756 --> 01:05:18.069
We're done.

01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:21.077
Cool.

01:05:35.156 --> 01:05:36.469
Fuck it.

01:05:40.916 --> 01:05:43.061
My mother used to say,
"Remember who you are

01:05:43.093 --> 01:05:44.468
and fuck it."

01:05:47.157 --> 01:05:50.037
What was your mother's name?

01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:51.957
Inga Görich.

01:08:23.317 --> 01:08:28.564
Sometimes I feel
like I should just go home.

01:08:28.595 --> 01:08:33.621
Because I feel so much
like a troll.

01:08:33.653 --> 01:08:36.245
I like trolls.

01:08:36.276 --> 01:08:39.444
They're so strong
and they're never afraid,

01:08:39.477 --> 01:08:42.901
and they work in dark,
cold places.

01:08:42.933 --> 01:08:44.979
Like me.

01:09:18.997 --> 01:09:20.180
Excuse me.

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:23.604
Oh, hey.

01:09:23.636 --> 01:09:26.005
- I'm proud of you, honey.
- I'm glad you came.

01:09:28.821 --> 01:09:33.203
In case you don't know
me, I am Levi,

01:09:33.237 --> 01:09:35.349
I am Gaby's father.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.285
And... uh...

01:09:39.316 --> 01:09:42.899
my Gaby made a decision.

01:09:42.933 --> 01:09:46.356
Now, would I pick
what she picked?

01:09:46.386 --> 01:09:47.541
Uh, no, I would not.

01:09:47.573 --> 01:09:49.589
No, sir, I would not.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.660
- Me neither!
- Oh my God.

01:09:52.693 --> 01:09:54.805
You know, most of us,

01:09:54.837 --> 01:09:58.069
something picks us
or we pick nothing,

01:09:58.101 --> 01:10:01.844
but, Gaby, you picked him
and we said no

01:10:01.877 --> 01:10:06.229
and you said, "I pick him
anyway" and you got him!

01:10:06.261 --> 01:10:07.507
Yeah.

01:10:09.332 --> 01:10:12.981
Nobody picked this except you.

01:10:13.012 --> 01:10:18.517
So whatever you have there
is your fault.

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:20.980
Your misery is your fault.

01:10:21.013 --> 01:10:24.981
Your happiness,
well, that's up to you.

01:10:26.676 --> 01:10:28.149
It's up to you.

01:10:36.916 --> 01:10:39.029
You know, the...

01:10:39.061 --> 01:10:41.716
the only thing
that ever made me...

01:10:41.749 --> 01:10:45.397
less scared of my misery...

01:10:45.429 --> 01:10:49.044
was my wife
and she's over there.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.501
Well...

01:10:56.533 --> 01:10:59.061
forgive me.

01:10:59.092 --> 01:11:00.885
I lost track of things.

01:11:08.437 --> 01:11:10.741
Well, let's strike up
the band, huh?

01:11:27.029 --> 01:11:28.725
- Can you bring those in?
- I got the last...

01:11:28.756 --> 01:11:30.645
I got this one.

01:11:30.676 --> 01:11:32.885
And there's so much crap...

01:11:34.581 --> 01:11:36.821
Nils had
disappeared into total silence

01:11:36.852 --> 01:11:40.020
but one day,
an envelope arrived,

01:11:40.053 --> 01:11:42.196
full of foreign postage stamps.

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:56.821
We passed.

01:12:03.157 --> 01:12:05.717
I thought I'd ruined everything.

01:12:05.748 --> 01:12:08.564
But maybe it was never
really that fragile.

01:12:32.532 --> 01:12:34.484
You've gotten
somewhere this summer.

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.085
She's getting there.

01:12:36.116 --> 01:12:37.684
It's breathtaking.

01:12:39.637 --> 01:12:42.966
I know this
woman and we've never met.

01:12:42.997 --> 01:12:44.308
Look at this light work.

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:49.748
Her gaze, it's quiet
and it's... radiant.

01:12:49.781 --> 01:12:52.501
Yeah, just stay on this path,
this is so good.

01:12:52.533 --> 01:12:54.037
Yeah, it is.

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.828
Did I run away from my life?

01:12:59.668 --> 01:13:01.397
Did I run toward it?

01:13:03.637 --> 01:13:05.237
Did I make the most of it?

01:13:08.373 --> 01:13:09.716
Did I fuck up?

01:13:17.173 --> 01:13:20.628
Did I... get where
I needed to go?

01:13:34.389 --> 01:13:36.788
What kind of place was this?

01:13:36.821 --> 01:13:39.636
And are you going
to be able to keep this up,

01:13:39.668 --> 01:13:41.462
now that you're back?

01:13:45.653 --> 01:13:47.477
Two, three.
