00:01.835 --> 00:03.671
Previously on 90210:

00:03.711 --> 00:06.632
Hey, you're up.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.635
You look beautiful.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.679
KENT:
I work with Amanda Barnard.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.096
She says your blog could be
the next Fifty Shades of Grey.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.723
What would it take to get you

00:14.765 --> 00:16.015
to let us publish your work?

00:16.056 --> 00:19.353
Your guarantee that nobody
will ever know I wrote it.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.189
Welcome to Armitage Books,
Author X.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.274
I just want to make sure
our parties our cool.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.359
That's why I
came to you.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.486
You're young,
you're fun, single.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.738
NAOMI:
Best way to start
getting over my divorce?

00:29.780 --> 00:31.156
Secure a hot new client.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.784
Hello, Jordan?
Naomi Clark.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.661
I ended up talking to Mark.

00:35.703 --> 00:36.620
And he ended up
coming home with me.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.497
I broke the pact,
and I'm really sorry.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.665
It's fine.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.252
My stepson's going to
be home soon, and...
I got it.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.338
(door closes)
CAMPBELL: I know,
they're withholding

00:46.380 --> 00:48.799
the semester grades because
they know we were cheating.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.049
It's going to come out.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.969
Everyone at Cronus
is going to be okay.

00:52.011 --> 00:54.805
I've set Navid Shirazi up
to take the fall

00:54.847 --> 00:57.558
for the whole thing.

01:03.731 --> 01:07.275
(laughing): I had no idea
what I wanted to do after Yale.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.610
None...

01:08.652 --> 01:10.362
I mean, for
about two minutes there,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.406
I wanted
to be a war photographer.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.616
(laughing): Shut the front door.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.743
I'm serious.

01:15.784 --> 01:16.702
Can you believe it?

01:16.744 --> 01:18.453
I-I didn't
even last a week.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.997
(laughing)

01:20.039 --> 01:22.791
Okay, so, from
failed war photographer
Mm-hmm.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.253
to successful owner
of a media company.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.295
That's pretty impressive.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.881
Well, that was another dream
of mine.

01:28.923 --> 01:31.675
But this one actually seems
to be coming true.

01:31.717 --> 01:36.013
And, as a bonus, I get to meet
interesting people like you.

01:36.055 --> 01:38.473
How's the food?

01:38.515 --> 01:39.641
Did I get the job?

01:39.683 --> 01:40.851
Ah, hell yes.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.270
Consider yourself hired
to cater my company's

01:43.311 --> 01:44.145
next big event, sir.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.397
Cool.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.941
Let's negotiate my salary after

01:46.982 --> 01:48.316
you try my bacon-wrapped
dates.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.072
Naomi, ever since we first met

01:53.113 --> 01:54.364
I've wanted you...

01:56.951 --> 01:59.202
Continue.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.705
...to plan an event
for my company.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.331
I would be honored.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.458
My next party

02:04.499 --> 02:08.044
needs to be mysterious,
glamorous and sexy.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.670
In other words,
it's perfect for you.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.548
I think you're great, too.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.927
Well, this
will fill you in

02:14.969 --> 02:17.304
on everything you
need to know about the event.

02:17.345 --> 02:20.223
All right, now,
it is all top secret.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.559
So, if you think there's a
chance that you might

02:22.601 --> 02:24.394
leave it at a coffee shop
or something somewhere,

02:24.436 --> 02:25.813
please, handcuff that
to yourself.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.107
Well, I... I do like handcuffs.
(laughing)

02:28.148 --> 02:29.524
My company's going
to need to throw

02:29.566 --> 02:31.693
a ton of major events
every year.

02:31.735 --> 02:35.363
So, if this party goes well...

02:35.405 --> 02:37.616
we are going to be spending
so much time together...

02:37.658 --> 02:38.993
you're going to get sick of me.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.286
(giggling)
(chuckling)

02:41.328 --> 02:42.955
I highly doubt that.

02:42.997 --> 02:46.583
Well, see you soon?

02:50.545 --> 02:52.965
Okay, you two
need to get a room

02:53.007 --> 02:54.382
before you cause
a chain reaction

02:54.424 --> 02:55.592
that destroys
the entire planet.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.718
You're insane.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.512
The ink on my
divorce is not even dry.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.973
Right now I need to avoid
a relationship like the plague.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.683
Sounds like you
have it all figured out.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.143
And I'm being facetious.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.812
(scoffing):
Jordan is not a rebound guy,

03:06.854 --> 03:08.063
he is boyfriend material

03:08.105 --> 03:09.898
and I am emotionally
not ready for that.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.067
That is shockingly
mature of you.

03:12.109 --> 03:15.029
Thank you.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.738
Although, if I

03:16.780 --> 03:18.406
happen to impressive the hell
out of him

03:18.448 --> 03:20.534
on a professional level,
and he happens

03:20.575 --> 03:22.661
to fall head over heels in love
with me as a result,

03:22.703 --> 03:25.706
then I will deal with that
at the appropriate time.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.624
You know,
you could tell him you like him.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.834
He's a smart guy.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.294
You mean, be honest?

03:31.336 --> 03:33.212
Ugh, I keep forgetting
you're new around here.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.298
Anyway, it's funny you should be
avoiding a relationship

03:35.340 --> 03:36.967
just when I'm trying
to get into one.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.510
Adrianna?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.470
I knew it was going to be
a good match.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.305
It's someone else,
who's pretty great.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.349
But I can't tell
if she's into me.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.476
And, besides,
I usually avoid relationships

03:46.518 --> 03:48.645
lasting longer
than a weekend.
Mm.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.564
I think Beverly Hills has fried
my brain.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.399
Oh, yes,
it will do that to you.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.693
Good luck.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.613
(knocking)

03:58.655 --> 04:00.574
(clears throat)

04:00.615 --> 04:02.283
Ade.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.284
Hi.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.452
What are you doing here?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.914
Uh, I was just dropping
something off for Dixon.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.624
I got to go.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.876
Okay, wait.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.961
Um, I really want to
talk about what happened.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.046
What do you mean?

04:14.088 --> 04:15.964
With me and Mark.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.132
I know you said things
were fine,

04:17.173 --> 04:18.298
but it's been
a week and you haven't

04:18.341 --> 04:19.634
returned any of my calls.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.429
Yeah, I've been so bad
at looking at my phone lately.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.764
Anyway...

04:23.805 --> 04:25.224
Ade, please.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.101
I hate this.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.810
Last time we fought over a guy

04:28.852 --> 04:30.437
things went down
a really dark path.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.231
Did they?

04:32.313 --> 04:35.358
(scoffs) That was so long ago,
I almost forgot.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.402
I was busy,
that's all.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.737
You should really work on

04:38.779 --> 04:40.822
not letting your imagination get
the best of you.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.535
MICHAELA:
Eggs Benedict tomorrow,

04:45.577 --> 04:46.870
a little turkey
bacon on the side.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.122
Oh, geez.
Can we do that?

04:48.163 --> 04:50.040
You two look cozy.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.708
You're not,

04:51.750 --> 04:53.334
like, dating my surrogate,
are you?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.129
What?

04:55.170 --> 04:56.755
No... no, hey, no.
(laughing)

04:56.797 --> 04:58.506
We just, uh, just
had breakfast.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.967
Dixon made me waffles.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.260
Really spoiling me.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.719
Huh.
I was making
some for myself,

05:02.761 --> 05:04.054
I had some extra batter,

05:04.096 --> 05:05.597
so I made some for her, too.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.808
And virgin mimosas.
What?

05:07.849 --> 05:08.809
The royal treatment.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.977
I know, right?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.645
Okay, guys, it's
just orange juice, okay?

05:11.686 --> 05:13.605
Let's not get
carried away, okay?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.440
So, what, Ade bakes you cookies?

05:15.482 --> 05:16.900
I thought
you guys hated each other.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.235
I don't know.

05:18.277 --> 05:20.028
She said she was thinking
about who her real friends were,

05:20.070 --> 05:21.989
and, how she wanted
to put the past behind her.

05:22.030 --> 05:22.948
You know how Ade is.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.074
Yeah, I do.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.617
I don't...

05:25.659 --> 05:26.952
I don't think we should be

05:26.994 --> 05:28.203
eating these,
you guys, okay?

05:30.747 --> 05:31.873
Silver, this
wouldn't happen to have

05:31.915 --> 05:33.292
anything to do
with you and Mark, would it?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.668
I mean, you know

05:34.709 --> 05:36.295
the last time you
and Ade fought over a guy.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.796
I know.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.339
And I have to handle it,
like, now.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.092
And I will.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.593
Can you drive her to the doctor?

05:43.635 --> 05:44.970
Oh, oh, um...

05:45.012 --> 05:46.013
It's just a blood test,

05:46.054 --> 05:47.181
it's not gonna take long.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.807
We can go to the
movies afterwards.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.349
(laughing)

05:50.391 --> 05:51.685
Uh, well, I don't mind
hanging out with you all day

05:51.726 --> 05:52.853
if Silver doesn't
have a problem with it.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.022
Why would I
have a problem with it?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.648
Great.
It's a date.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.732
Yeah.

05:57.774 --> 05:58.900
Thank you.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.027
It-it's-it's not a date.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.737
Um, just-just, just errands.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.701
CAMPBELL: Court, what time does
that brew pub of yours close?

06:07.742 --> 06:08.743
'Cause we should have

06:08.785 --> 06:10.162
our next poker game
there, after hours.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.788
You say when,
I'll make it happen.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.124
All right, let's do it.
(phone rings)

06:14.166 --> 06:15.542
It's, uh...
Got to take this.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.793
Yeah, man.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.712
Hey, Mom, how are you?

06:18.753 --> 06:19.796
NAVID:
I'm doing terrible, son.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.882
Uh, I'm about
to get expelled

06:21.923 --> 06:23.758
and you're hanging out
with the bad guys?

06:23.800 --> 06:24.926
You're supposed
to be helping me,

06:24.968 --> 06:25.886
or did you already forget?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.221
I didn't forget...

06:27.262 --> 06:29.723
to send Grandma
a birthday card.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.226
Okay,
just left the dean's office.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.435
My disciplinary hearing
is Tuesday.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.854
Unless you find the evidence
that proves

06:35.896 --> 06:37.356
that I'm being framed
by Campbell for heading up

06:37.438 --> 06:39.233
the cheating ring,
I'm screwed.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.775
LIAM:
I hear you loud and clear.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.278
Don't worry about it.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.612
I love you, too.

06:46.365 --> 06:47.824
So, poker at Offshore.
Yeah.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.450
Your mom can
come if she wants.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.785
No, I think mom is...

06:50.827 --> 06:52.871
She's good.
Yeah, all right.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.625
Undressed is
generating so much buzz.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.253
We're even getting requests
for interviews

06:59.294 --> 07:00.545
from national TV shows.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.463
I've already written
a press release.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.216
Not a chance.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.424
Amanda, we've
spoken about this.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.760
I know.

07:06.801 --> 07:10.638
It's just, your blog is about
the real life experience

07:10.680 --> 07:12.057
of an anonymous author.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.268
People are clamoring
to find out who's who.

07:14.309 --> 07:17.396
Is there anything I can say
to change your mind?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.439
I'm sorry, but I don't want
any of my friends--

07:19.480 --> 07:21.400
and especially not my brother--

07:21.441 --> 07:23.526
to find out that I wrote this.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.445
Dixon would be devastated

07:25.486 --> 07:27.530
if he knew how I got the money
to pay for his rehab.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.949
And you think
no one will find out

07:28.990 --> 07:30.784
even though there's a whole book
about your life

07:30.825 --> 07:32.411
on the national
best seller list?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.828
Dixon and Liam
are not going to be reading

07:33.870 --> 07:34.913
a tell-all sex book.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.040
And my girlfriends
either know the truth,

07:37.082 --> 07:38.541
or would never imagine
it was me.

07:38.583 --> 07:42.045
So, trust me, I am flying
totally under the radar on this.

07:42.087 --> 07:45.340
(knocking)
Hey, is this my favorite
new author?

07:45.382 --> 07:46.883
Jordan, meet
Annie Wilson.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.302
Oh, Author X.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.552
Uh, and don't worry, Annie,

07:49.594 --> 07:50.678
Amanda's made it quite clear
how important

07:50.720 --> 07:51.930
your anonymity is to you.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.015
And, uh, as much as we
wish we could convince you

07:54.057 --> 07:55.475
to change your mind,

07:55.516 --> 07:56.810
the final decision
rests with you.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.895
I appreciate that.

07:58.937 --> 08:02.190
But I have made the launch
of your book

08:02.232 --> 08:03.524
my top priority.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.568
And you wouldn't believe
how much time and money

08:05.610 --> 08:07.237
I spent on just the party alone.

08:07.279 --> 08:10.157
Well, it sounds like I'll be
missing quite the event.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.450
Don't.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.742
You know, it-it's the biggest
night of your life.

08:12.784 --> 08:13.743
It-it'd be a shame to miss it.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.162
That's a great idea.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.621
As far as anybody would know,

08:16.663 --> 08:18.581
you're just another cute girl
there for the free champagne.

08:18.623 --> 08:23.128
I guess maybe it would be fun
to be there anonymously.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.588
Kind of like Tom Sawyer
at his own funeral.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.382
Well, it is going to be so much
more fun than a funeral.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.883
Believe me. (laughing)

08:28.925 --> 08:31.219
I have hired one of the hottest
young party planners

08:31.261 --> 08:33.013
in all of Beverly Hills.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.306
Ms. Naomi Clark.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.224
You ever heard of her?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.770
(theme music playing)

09:02.792 --> 09:04.461
Pack your bags, lady,

09:04.503 --> 09:07.255
we are going on
a fabulous spa weekend.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.298
What?
Yep.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.549
I booked us adjoining rooms

09:09.590 --> 09:10.550
at Le Meurice

09:10.591 --> 09:11.634
and a private tour

09:11.676 --> 09:13.303
of some very
exclusive vineyards.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.929
Let's get you packed.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.681
Well, that is admirable,
but I can't right now.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.392
I have to plan this party.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.143
What do you think?

09:21.186 --> 09:22.437
I think,

09:22.479 --> 09:23.730
blow it off.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.606
I mean, who cares about a stupid
book launch, anyway?

09:25.648 --> 09:27.234
This is event is the key to me

09:27.275 --> 09:28.485
making a lasting
impression on Jordan.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.819
And I have to find a way

09:29.861 --> 09:32.406
to make it more than just a
fabulous party, 'cause...

09:32.447 --> 09:33.865
Well, wait, how did you know it
was a book launch?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.534
I said it was
a really big secret.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.869
Well, I...
just assumed.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.205
Because, well...

09:40.247 --> 09:42.749
there's a book
on the table.

09:42.790 --> 09:46.420
And heaven forbid I read a book
for sheer pleasure?

09:47.379 --> 09:48.588
Okay, you know me too well.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.548
(laughing)

09:49.589 --> 09:50.715
Although I read
a lot of this

09:50.757 --> 09:52.551
and it is really,
really sexy.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.678
You think so?
Mm-hmm.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.765
Undressed, by Author X.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.101
Uh, have you heard of it?
I've...

10:01.142 --> 10:03.311
I've kind of been following it
since it started as a blog.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.188
I guess you could call me a fan.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.148
Well, I overheard Jordan
talking with his editor.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.649
Apparently, they're
both really bummed.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.692
The girl who wrote it

10:09.734 --> 10:11.194
wants to stay
trapped in the closet,

10:11.236 --> 10:13.613
so it gave me an idea
on how to make my party special.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.031
I'm going
to find Author X

10:15.073 --> 10:17.534
and I am going
to have her come out.

10:17.576 --> 10:18.618
What?

10:18.659 --> 10:19.702
Jordan is going
to be thrilled.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.079
He's going
to have me plan

10:21.121 --> 10:22.830
all of his parties
from here on out.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.375
Uh, but, uh, don't you think

10:25.417 --> 10:27.627
there's a very good reason
why the author

10:27.668 --> 10:29.170
would want to remain anonymous?

10:29.212 --> 10:30.380
Uh, no.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.715
She's just
misguided and scared.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.801
She just needs a peer--
a reader, not an editor--

10:34.842 --> 10:36.761
to talk some sense into her.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.430
And that can be you.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.680
Me?

10:39.722 --> 10:40.723
You said it yourself.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.100
You followed her blog,
you're a fan.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.978
I... I am going to be very busy

10:45.019 --> 10:47.397
drinking wine and-and getting
massaged with hot rocks.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.773
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.234
Annie, I order you to bring me

10:51.276 --> 10:52.860
Author X's head on a platter.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.446
Hmm.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.285
(sighs)

11:00.327 --> 11:03.037
Finally. I almost
started without you.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.747
(both chuckle)

11:04.789 --> 11:06.082
Sorry. I've been hanging out

11:06.124 --> 11:08.084
with Campbell
and the Cronus guys all day

11:08.126 --> 11:10.128
trying to find a way
to help Navid.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.296
Ah. Any luck?

11:11.338 --> 11:13.465
(groans)
No.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.091
Campbell's a jerk,

11:15.133 --> 11:16.551
but he's smart.

11:16.593 --> 11:20.180
Only way to help Navid
is to actually catch
Campbell cheating.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.015
Mm. (laughs)

11:22.056 --> 11:24.683
But we won't have
a chance to do that

11:24.725 --> 11:26.936
until the semester ends...

11:26.978 --> 11:28.522
and finals start.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.731
Maybe you don't have
to wait that long.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.276
I might be able
to help you.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.862
You think so?
Absolutely.

11:35.903 --> 11:38.781
In fact, I already
have a plan in mind.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.534
Hmm.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.952
(laughs)

11:45.288 --> 11:47.999
You two are so
cute together.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.626
Is this your first?

11:49.668 --> 11:51.878
Oh, um...

11:51.919 --> 11:54.297
N-No, no. Um...
we're not together.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.924
She's actually
my roommate.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.301
What would even
make you think that?

11:58.343 --> 12:00.470
Guess I'm crazy.
(laughing)

12:00.512 --> 12:01.720
WOMAN:
Jennifer, you're up.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.976
That's nuts, huh?
She thought we were together.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.603
When I was here last
week with Silver,

12:08.645 --> 12:10.146
somebody thought that
we were a couple.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.607
Apparently when
you're pregnant,

12:12.649 --> 12:14.025
people see
you differently.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.402
Oh. Well, I don't.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.154
I just think of you as
a landlord with a tiny tenant.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.031
(laughing)

12:20.073 --> 12:22.242
That's sweet.
Yeah.

12:22.283 --> 12:26.162
You know, the thing is,
I'm the same girl I was.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.248
I just want
to have fun,

12:28.289 --> 12:30.917
make friends,
maybe go on some dates.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.085
So what's stopping you?

12:32.126 --> 12:34.003
Come on,
what am I supposed to do?

12:34.045 --> 12:36.755
Go up to some guy and be,
like, "Hey, I like you.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.092
After my next sonogram
let's go get some pizza."

12:40.468 --> 12:42.554
Now, what guy's
gonna go for that?

12:42.596 --> 12:44.847
Michaela,
you're next.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.642
Looks like I'm up.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.317
Hey.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.611
Perfect timing.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.738
I was just
closing up.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.864
The kitchen, that is.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.534
My lips are still
open for business.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.202
I can't...
we can't do this.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.621
Well, it's
just kissing.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.290
And I swear on my A-rating
from the health inspector,

13:10.331 --> 13:13.668
our clothes won't come off
until we're in the car.
I mean...

13:13.710 --> 13:15.545
we can't see each other anymore.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.880
I thought this was going great.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.550
(sighs):
It was. Really great.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.135
I'm sorry.

13:22.176 --> 13:25.764
So to recap:
you and I totally connect,

13:25.804 --> 13:27.724
we have amazing sex,

13:27.766 --> 13:30.101
we're both single
and we like each other.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.061
I can see why that's a problem.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.649
It's not us. It's Ade.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.776
I thought you said
you told her the truth

13:37.816 --> 13:40.861
and she said she
was fine with it.
I did, and she did.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.989
But Ade and I have a really
complicated relationship

13:43.030 --> 13:44.324
ever since high school.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.285
I did some things to her
that I'm not exactly proud of.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.204
And then she did
some things to me
that nearly killed me.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.957
So... I know if we keep dating,

13:52.999 --> 13:54.709
something really awful's
gonna happen.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.795
Silver...
No, Mark,
I know Ade.

13:56.835 --> 14:00.381
She said she's fine,
but she's not fine.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.091
I'm sorry.

14:02.133 --> 14:05.178
I can't see you anymore.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.899
Hey, man, give me one of those.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.153
(chuckles)
You all right?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.614
We have to cancel
poker tonight.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.157
Oh, that's a shame.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.618
I was looking forward
to taking all your money.
Mm.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.537
What happened?

14:30.578 --> 14:32.539
All the econ grades
were held up

14:32.580 --> 14:34.123
because of the
cheating scandal.

14:34.165 --> 14:37.544
You can't even apply
to B School without
a grade in honors economics.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.003
When my stepmom heard that,

14:39.045 --> 14:41.172
she started nagging my dad
to call the dean

14:41.214 --> 14:43.883
and demand that our class
be able to retake the test.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.468
It's tomorrow.

14:45.510 --> 14:48.971
Hm. Well, since you've
already studied
for the test,

14:49.013 --> 14:51.850
I mean, retaking it should
be a breeze, right?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.309
Don't be cute.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.062
I didn't exactly prepare the
traditional way the first time,

14:56.103 --> 14:57.564
if you know what I mean.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.567
What do you mean, you cheated?

15:02.026 --> 15:04.028
This time everything's
on strict lockdown.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.447
They're not letting
cell phones into the room.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.157
We're screwed.

15:10.702 --> 15:11.786
You know...

15:11.828 --> 15:14.121
there's more than one
way to get information

15:14.163 --> 15:15.915
into an exam room.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.292
I might have an idea for you.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.295
(knocking on door)

15:21.337 --> 15:23.506
Did I mention people
in the restaurant business

15:23.548 --> 15:25.675
tend to sleep late?
I'm sorry, bro,

15:25.717 --> 15:27.552
but... I really need your help,

15:27.594 --> 15:30.179
and I can't speak
to anyone else about this.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.972
Who is she?

15:32.014 --> 15:33.725
Damn, Jedi.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.142
Uh...

15:35.184 --> 15:37.771
well, it's Michaela.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.774
The girl whose career
I'm trying to start,

15:40.815 --> 15:43.777
my roommate,
and also Silver's baby mama.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.528
I-I know,
I know, look,

15:45.570 --> 15:47.572
I was planning on staying
the hell away from her,

15:47.614 --> 15:49.031
not telling her
how I feel, but...

15:49.073 --> 15:52.076
What made you change your mind--
besides your penis?

15:52.118 --> 15:55.162
Ha. Sh-She was talking about
how nobody

15:55.204 --> 15:56.831
would want to date her
because she's pregnant.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.250
And I wanted to tell her
that she's wrong,

15:59.292 --> 16:00.585
I want to date her,

16:00.627 --> 16:03.379
and if this is something
that she wants as well, then...

16:03.421 --> 16:04.923
we should just go for it.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.716
What do you need from me?
I was hoping

16:06.758 --> 16:09.260
that you can talk to her,
find out if she's interested.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.219
I don't know

16:10.261 --> 16:11.846
if she feels
the same way or not,

16:11.888 --> 16:14.014
so I-I just don't want
to feel like an idiot.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.976
I've got an idea:
put a note in her locker

16:17.017 --> 16:20.146
and ask her to circle
the smiley face
if she likes you.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.148
Are you serious?

16:22.189 --> 16:24.066
What is it
with you and your friends?

16:24.108 --> 16:26.486
You all act like you're
still in high school together.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.529
You can't have a conversation
face-to-face,

16:28.571 --> 16:30.030
you got to play
these stupid games.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.032
It's time for all of you
to grow up.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.869
Yeah, remind me to never
wake you up again.
(laughs)

16:34.911 --> 16:36.663
Look, I'm sorry.

16:36.704 --> 16:40.458
Hey, can you give me
Adrianna's phone number?

16:44.587 --> 16:47.548
Hey. Please tell me
you got some information

16:47.590 --> 16:49.843
that could keep me
from getting expelled.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.637
You're still taking
that econ final makeup
exam tomorrow, right?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.722
Yeah, of course--
they're making
everybody take it again.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.642
Good. Campbell and
some of the Cronus
guys'll be there, too,

16:57.684 --> 16:59.769
and you're gonna
catch them cheating.
What?

16:59.811 --> 17:02.313
No, there's no way
they're stupid enough
to be caught cheating again.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.816
They're not stupid;
they're desperate.

17:04.858 --> 17:09.487
They're gonna be smuggling in
cheat sheets on the inside
of water bottle labels.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.781
That's genius.
It's just a
little something

17:11.823 --> 17:13.281
I learned in eighth
grade detention.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.034
But... you have
to make sure

17:15.075 --> 17:16.410
they get caught cheating.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.662
Now, once they drink the water,

17:17.704 --> 17:19.204
they'll be able
to read the answers.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.833
That's when you need to make
sure the proctor catches them.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.210
That way there's no doubt
who the guilty ones are.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.713
Liam, I really want
to kiss you right now.

17:26.753 --> 17:28.882
Resist that urge.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.514
(Annie sighs)

17:36.556 --> 17:38.766
Good news.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.226
I found Author X.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.102
Oh, my God, Annie,
that's amazing!

17:42.144 --> 17:43.688
(laughs)
Yeah.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.648
Her name is Barbara Peltier.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.066
She lives in Beverly Hills,

17:47.107 --> 17:49.235
married to a surgeon,
couple of kids.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.029
Oh. Okay, so she's a soccer mom.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.948
Little boring on the outside,
but has this secret, kinky life.

17:53.990 --> 17:54.949
This is gonna

17:54.991 --> 17:56.617
be fun!
Naomi!

17:56.659 --> 17:58.912
She has a family,
friends, a community.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.914
She's a member
of the Beverly Hills

18:00.955 --> 18:02.749
Country Club.
Maybe she wanted
to be anonymous

18:02.790 --> 18:04.667
because the people she loves
might get hurt

18:04.709 --> 18:05.919
if they knew her true identity.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.462
Or maybe she could
come out publicly

18:08.504 --> 18:09.923
and feel free.

18:09.964 --> 18:13.009
She is not gonna come out, okay?

18:13.051 --> 18:14.719
The stakes are just too high.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.470
I know you don't understand that

18:16.512 --> 18:18.305
because you feel completely
comfortable with yourself.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.183
(sighs):
That's not entirely true.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.435
Me and Jordan,

18:22.476 --> 18:23.895
I... don't feel comfortable
telling him

18:23.937 --> 18:26.188
that I don't feel ready
to date right now,

18:26.230 --> 18:28.858
so to keep his interest
I need the author of this book

18:28.900 --> 18:31.318
to hold her head high
and admit who she is.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.612
What book?

18:32.653 --> 18:34.321
Some anonymous
soft-core porn book.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.823
Frankly, I have a
hard time believing

18:35.865 --> 18:39.243
that the author of such sexy--
no, filthy things

18:39.285 --> 18:40.870
could be a boring housewife.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.997
It is not filthy;
it's art.

18:43.039 --> 18:46.000
It's a coming-of-age story.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.501
I mean, that's what I've heard.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.588
I read the same page
five times; it's nasty.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.132
It is a candid exploration
of sexuality.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.383
Silver,

18:54.425 --> 18:56.719
why don't you be the judge?

18:56.761 --> 18:58.846
Read this part right here...

18:58.888 --> 19:00.807
where Annabelle
does it

19:00.848 --> 19:03.517
with the businessman
in a helicopter.

19:07.438 --> 19:08.940
Oh, my God.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.441
I told you.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.735
Yes, this is really shocking.

19:12.777 --> 19:16.322
Um... I-I need some cold water.

19:16.363 --> 19:20.743
Annie, perhaps you'd...
care to join me for one?

19:21.661 --> 19:22.787
(Annie grunts)

19:22.829 --> 19:24.163
Okay, um...
(clears throat)

19:24.204 --> 19:25.205
so, did you

19:25.247 --> 19:26.791
actually write
a dirty tell-all book

19:26.833 --> 19:28.501
about being a hooker?

19:28.542 --> 19:31.671
I mean... congratulations,
but seriously?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.589
Is it that obvious?
It took me

19:33.631 --> 19:36.509
almost half a page to figure
it out. Annie, anyone who knows

19:36.550 --> 19:38.427
the truth is gonna
figure out that it's you

19:38.469 --> 19:39.846
in, like, less than a minute.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.849
I don't want this
to sound wrong, but, um...

19:42.890 --> 19:44.266
what were you thinking?

19:44.308 --> 19:46.560
I wasn't. But now it's
turned into this huge thing

19:46.602 --> 19:48.604
that I should be proud of,
except I'm not,

19:48.646 --> 19:51.231
because all I can think is:
what if Dixon finds out?

19:51.273 --> 19:52.775
Well, look, the only people

19:52.817 --> 19:54.652
who know the truth
are me and Liam, right?

19:54.694 --> 19:55.987
Liam's never gonna
read this book.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.072
So you just need to get
through Naomi's party

19:58.114 --> 20:01.325
without it coming out, and...
Dixon will never find out

20:01.367 --> 20:03.703
NAOMI: Mm-hmm. Okay. Of course.
what happened
between you and Patrick.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.915
And you're sure
that she was the only
Barbara Peltier there?

20:07.957 --> 20:09.959
Okay. Thank
you, Candy.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.210
(laughs):
Bye.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.420
What's that all about?
That was
my friend

20:13.462 --> 20:15.006
from the Beverly Hills
Country Club.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.508
She said Barbara Peltier
and her husband moved to Uganda

20:17.550 --> 20:19.343
two years ago to perform
lifesaving surgeries

20:19.385 --> 20:20.761
on underprivileged people,
which means...

20:20.803 --> 20:23.556
she could not
have written the book.
The book launch

20:23.597 --> 20:27.309
is tomorrow, so I guess
Author X will remain
anonymous after all.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.854
Unless I figure out
who she is at the party.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.356
Uh...

20:32.398 --> 20:34.358
how are you
going to do that?

20:34.400 --> 20:36.819
Ah, Amanda and Jordan
are the only two people

20:36.861 --> 20:38.612
who know who
Author X is, so...

20:38.654 --> 20:41.115
I'll watch them at
the party, and I'm sure
they'll give it away.

20:41.157 --> 20:45.703
It's the only way I can
ensure that I'm actually gonna
throw the best party ever.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.329
Oh, masks!

20:47.371 --> 20:48.455
What?

20:48.497 --> 20:49.707
It's a super-sexy

20:49.749 --> 20:52.626
book launch
for an anonymous author, right?

20:52.668 --> 20:55.546
Why not have everybody
come wearing a mask?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.090
Annie, that's brilliant.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.591
You're really smart.

20:58.632 --> 20:59.926
It's a shame

20:59.967 --> 21:02.136
you're independently wealthy.
With a little motivation

21:02.178 --> 21:04.471
you could accomplish
something impressive.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.229
Hi.
ADRIANNA:
Hi.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.606
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

21:17.735 --> 21:19.779
I like Silver.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.488
So I've been told.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.741
No. She told you
I slept with her.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.826
I'm telling you
I like her.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.495
But she broke up with me
because she's scared
of what you'll do.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.414
So I need you
to stop playing games

21:30.456 --> 21:32.708
and have a fight with her
like a normal person.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.293
I'm not playing
head games.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.378
I told Silver
I'm fine with it.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.464
Which is the biggest
head game of all.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.716
Why actually get revenge
when you can torture her

21:40.758 --> 21:43.136
by making her anticipate
your revenge?

21:43.177 --> 21:46.222
That act might work with her,
but not with me.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.141
Okay, fine.
You're right,
I'm pissed.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.976
We had a pact,
and she broke it.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.770
So, yeah, I would like to
see her suffer a little.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.730
She betrayed me, again.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.941
You're right, she did.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.985
And you deserve revenge.

22:00.153 --> 22:03.447
So let's get it, the fun way.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.448
What are you doing?

22:04.490 --> 22:07.243
I slept with Silver;
I'll sleep with you.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.328
You're not serious.
Of course I am.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.205
But I thought
you liked Silver.

22:11.247 --> 22:14.416
Yeah, but... she
broke up with me.

22:16.210 --> 22:18.504
Don't think I
wouldn't do it.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.714
She hurt me,
and I have

22:20.756 --> 22:22.800
no problem hurting
her right back.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.302
Great.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.846
We can hurt her all night long.

22:30.641 --> 22:31.851
You're disgusting.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.936
I can't believe you would
do that to my friend!

22:33.978 --> 22:37.023
Oh. So she's your friend, huh?

22:37.064 --> 22:38.691
If she's your friend,

22:38.732 --> 22:41.944
then stop playing games
and tell Silver

22:41.986 --> 22:44.238
how you feel about what she did.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.326

from such a little girl.

26:57.575 --> 26:58.784
I won't be little for long.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.660
Typical pregnancy weight
gain is 25 pounds,

27:00.702 --> 27:02.788
but I'm a bit of
an overachiever.
Okay.

27:02.829 --> 27:05.541
I think I'm gonna
go for at least 40.

27:05.583 --> 27:06.875
40?
Mm-hmm.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.419
Okay.
Sexy, right?

27:08.461 --> 27:10.003
Uh, you-you got...

27:10.045 --> 27:12.047
Just a...

27:13.382 --> 27:15.717
And see, now that's sexy.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.097
(clears throat)

27:20.139 --> 27:22.391
Hey, um,
I just want to say something

27:22.433 --> 27:24.184
before I completely chicken out,
okay?

27:24.226 --> 27:25.643
Okay.
So just deal with me.

27:25.685 --> 27:27.980
Uh, I like you.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.607
I like you a lot,

27:29.689 --> 27:31.817
and I don't care
how pregnant you are.

27:33.651 --> 27:35.112
Okay, that came out wrong.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.239
(chuckles)
Hah...

27:37.281 --> 27:38.324
sorry.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.699
Dixon, listen,

27:39.741 --> 27:41.910
I think you're a great guy,

27:41.952 --> 27:43.412
and I like you, I do,

27:43.454 --> 27:45.581
just... not like that.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.001
Um, truth be told,

27:49.042 --> 27:51.295
I-I kind of like Navid.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.255
Navid?

27:53.297 --> 27:55.799
But I thought
you two weren't happening.

27:55.841 --> 27:56.967
We really liked each other

27:57.009 --> 27:59.219
till he found out
I was Silver's surrogate.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.096
I actually can't get him
out of my head,

28:01.138 --> 28:02.222
and I'm trying to figure out

28:02.264 --> 28:03.765
whether or not
I should tell him.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.520
I really do think
you're a great guy, though.

28:07.561 --> 28:08.937
Don't worry about it.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.939
Seriously, we've been spending
so much time together,

28:10.981 --> 28:12.983
I guess I got confused,

28:13.025 --> 28:14.527
emotionally.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.989
Hey, I'm-I'm gonna get, uh,
some more napkins.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.115
Uh, you need anything?

28:20.157 --> 28:21.492
No, I'm good. Thanks.

28:21.534 --> 28:22.700
Good?
Yeah.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.495
Cool.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.380
How about
those profiteroles?

28:34.421 --> 28:36.131
Oh, seriously,
the food's amazing, Mark.

28:36.173 --> 28:37.841
You're the least
of my worries tonight.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.926
(sighs)

28:50.770 --> 28:52.898
I knew I picked the
right event planner.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.608
This party's even
sexier than the book.

28:54.650 --> 28:55.651
Oh, well, that's me.

28:55.693 --> 28:57.069
I'm all about sexy.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.445
Professionally sexy.

28:58.487 --> 28:59.613
(chuckles)

28:59.655 --> 29:02.074
There you are.
Hey there.

29:02.115 --> 29:05.160
Uh, Naomi, this
is, uh, Elizabeth.

29:05.202 --> 29:06.370
Lovely to meet you, Elizabeth.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.830
I'm so glad I was in town
for Jordan's party.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.165
Oh, where are you in from?

29:10.207 --> 29:12.167
The East Coast.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.752
Well, that narrows it down.

29:13.793 --> 29:17.172
Yeah, uh, Elizabeth is a
bit of a private person.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.674
Likes to keep an
air of mystery.

29:18.716 --> 29:19.799
Huh?

29:19.841 --> 29:21.552
Will you excuse us just
for one second, please?

29:21.594 --> 29:22.802
Of course.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.638
It was nice to meet you, Naomi.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.307
Hi, I made it.
Hi.

29:27.349 --> 29:29.101
You look amazing;
I'm sorry I'm late.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.644
I know I'm supposed to be
staking out the bathrooms,

29:30.686 --> 29:32.438
but I just got into a
really awful conversation

29:32.479 --> 29:33.980
with Adrianna.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.441
It's really not a problem.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.193
I think I found Author X.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.570
You did?

29:39.612 --> 29:41.238
Oh, yeah.

29:42.573 --> 29:45.367
Do you see the woman
standing next to Jordan?

29:45.409 --> 29:47.119
It was obvious
she had a secret

29:47.160 --> 29:48.870
that neither one of them
wanted me to know,

29:48.912 --> 29:51.915
and when I get her alone, I'm
gonna grill her like a steak.

29:58.922 --> 30:02.384
LIAM:
"Chapter five,
Annabelle and Leo.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.595
"There was something different
about Leo.

30:04.637 --> 30:08.599
"Annabelle could feel it
the first time they met,

30:08.641 --> 30:10.517
"but she was with someone,
and he was a loner.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.644
"She didn't know

30:11.685 --> 30:13.103
"how little
those details mattered

30:13.145 --> 30:15.814
"until the winter's night
when he was almost killed

30:15.855 --> 30:17.483
in a motorcycle accident."

30:17.524 --> 30:18.858
Hmm.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.570
"They say the streets are mean.

30:21.612 --> 30:22.655
They would be right."

30:22.696 --> 30:24.740
We have a problem.
Yeah, I know.

30:24.782 --> 30:27.284
I may have put too many actual
facts in the book after all.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.077
No, bigger problem.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.288
Naomi thinks she's figured
out who Author X is.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.290
She knows it's me?

30:33.332 --> 30:34.833
Not exactly.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.543
"...Leo was the pavement.

30:36.585 --> 30:39.379
It was a losing proposition
from the get-go."

30:43.133 --> 30:46.303
You're all on academic probation
pending an investigation.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.514
Not that we'll have to
do much investigating.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.723
Dean Bergman,
I think this proves

30:49.765 --> 30:50.849
that I wasn't the ringleader.

30:50.890 --> 30:53.059
The answers I texted
on the physics exam

30:53.101 --> 30:55.437
were a small part
of their much larger scheme.

30:55.479 --> 30:59.232
Wait, it was Liam's idea
to use the water labels.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.610
You set us up.

31:01.652 --> 31:03.362
You and Court
are gonna pay for this.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.155
Good luck getting
into business school now,

31:05.197 --> 31:06.448
you son of a bitch.

31:06.490 --> 31:07.949
I hope it's clear now, sir,

31:07.991 --> 31:10.285
that these guys
are the real cheaters.

31:10.327 --> 31:11.745
The fact that others
cheated, too,

31:11.787 --> 31:13.246
doesn't mitigate what you did.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.581
Wait, what?

31:14.623 --> 31:15.957
What-what are you saying?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.543
If the evidence
against you holds up,

31:17.584 --> 31:19.503
there will be consequences,

31:19.545 --> 31:20.879
but just
because others are guilty

31:20.920 --> 31:22.088
doesn't make you innocent.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.341
If you cheated,
you'll be punished.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.097
MAN:
Champagne?

31:31.139 --> 31:32.808
Thank you.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.478
Hi, Elizabeth.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.271
Hi.
(laughs)

31:38.313 --> 31:40.399
Oh, Undressed is
a really good book.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.358
Don't you agree?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.151
Absolutely, I
couldn't put it down.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.277
(chuckles)

31:44.319 --> 31:46.112
Listen, I know
why you're here.

31:46.154 --> 31:50.033
And I know why you don't want
people to know you're here.

31:50.075 --> 31:50.992
You do?

31:51.034 --> 31:53.036
It's kind of obvious.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.246
Why hide?

31:54.287 --> 31:55.664
You should be proud
of who you are.

31:55.706 --> 31:56.665
If I were in your shoes,

31:56.707 --> 31:58.250
I would be shouting it
from the rooftop.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.085
I don't really need
that kind of attention.

32:00.126 --> 32:01.503
But you deserve it.

32:01.545 --> 32:05.006
You wrote the most candid book
about sex in the last ten years.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.466
Wait, I don't think
we're on the same page here.

32:06.508 --> 32:08.719
Uh, Naomi,
please listen to me.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.053
You need to drop this.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.431
Why would I do that when
I'm so close? Annie, Elizabeth.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.973
Elizabeth, Annie.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.809
It's okay to admit the truth.

32:15.851 --> 32:18.228
I'm sorry, but I have nothing
to do with this book.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.855
You have accomplished
something incredible here.

32:19.897 --> 32:23.149
The book is real and raw
and daring.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.694
It's gonna inspire
millions of young women

32:25.736 --> 32:27.320
to own their mistakes,
to tell the world,

32:27.362 --> 32:28.988
"This who I am,
this is what I've done,

32:29.030 --> 32:30.490
and I have nothing
to be ashamed of."

32:30.532 --> 32:32.242
Oh, that's...

32:32.284 --> 32:34.202
very true,

32:34.244 --> 32:35.579
but, Naomi, you should stop.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.706
Annie, she should hear this.

32:37.748 --> 32:40.083
Elizabeth,
take a look around you.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.043
Everybody here is
here for one reason,

32:42.085 --> 32:43.295
and that's you.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.963
It doesn't matter
what's happened in your life,

32:45.004 --> 32:47.925
it-it's about how you've used
those experiences

32:47.966 --> 32:49.259
to create something wonderful.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.428
If I were you, I would
hold that book high

32:51.470 --> 32:54.264
and say, "I am Author X,

32:54.306 --> 32:56.057
and I am proud to be a whore."

32:56.099 --> 32:59.060
Whoa, whoa,
what's going on here?

32:59.102 --> 33:01.772
Your part planner is trying
to get me to admit I'm Author X.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.523
But she isn't.

33:03.565 --> 33:04.983
She has nothing
to be ashamed of.

33:05.024 --> 33:07.068
Who cares if you took
money for sex

33:07.110 --> 33:09.279
to help your brother?

33:09.321 --> 33:11.490
Naomi, Elizabeth
is not Author X.

33:11.531 --> 33:12.741
Wait till I tell Mom about this.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.451
(low sigh)

33:14.493 --> 33:16.536
What, what would
she tell your mother?

33:16.578 --> 33:18.914
Because she's my sister.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.959
Oh, my God.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.670
Please tell me

33:24.711 --> 33:27.088
I did not just call Jordan's
sister a prostitute.

33:27.130 --> 33:31.301
Actually that's what you
just called me.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.553
I'm Author X.

33:41.979 --> 33:43.981
NAOMI:
You could've mentioned
you wrote the book

33:44.022 --> 33:46.692
before I made that big
of a fool out of myself.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.026
Naomi, I am so sorry.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.319
I ruined everything.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.531
(laughs) No, I ruined
it all by myself.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.741
I was so concerned
with not jumping

33:54.783 --> 33:57.661
into another relationship
'cause I might screw things up

33:57.703 --> 33:59.579
that I screwed things up.

33:59.621 --> 34:02.374
I know why I didn't want
Dixon to find out,

34:02.415 --> 34:05.502
but why didn't you just tell
Jordan the truth to begin with?

34:05.544 --> 34:08.672
Because I'm terrified.

34:08.714 --> 34:12.300
Jordan's the first guy
I've liked since my divorce.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.219
I was so sure
that Max was the one,

34:15.261 --> 34:16.889
and now...

34:16.929 --> 34:20.099
if another relationship with
the perfect guy gets ruined,

34:20.141 --> 34:22.351
I'll know it's me.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.728
I'm the problem.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.563
I get that.

34:25.605 --> 34:26.815
I mean, who am I to talk?

34:26.857 --> 34:28.567
I wrote this book so I could
finally move forward

34:28.608 --> 34:31.152
with my life,
but everything you said

34:31.194 --> 34:34.614
about why Author X should
come clean makes sense.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.492
Keeping my identity
a secret's actually just

34:37.534 --> 34:40.786
preventing me from really
letting go of the past.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.916
Well, if it means anything,

34:43.956 --> 34:46.167
those god-awful things
I said to Elizabeth...

34:46.208 --> 34:49.922
(laughs)
are actually true.

34:49.963 --> 34:52.172
Your book is something
to be proud of.

34:52.215 --> 34:55.844
I know, I'm starting
to realize that.

34:55.886 --> 34:57.178
I need to tell the truth.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.974
Let Amanda put out that press
release that Author X is

35:01.016 --> 35:03.894
gonna go on TV and introduce
herself to the world.

35:03.936 --> 35:06.605
No more masks.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.314
I'm done hiding.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.486
Liam, Liam, wait!

35:13.528 --> 35:15.488
I owe you an explanation.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.865
What's to explain?

35:16.907 --> 35:19.659
How if I told what I knew
about Campbell's cheating ring

35:19.701 --> 35:21.703
was your brute of a husband
gonna hurt you?

35:21.745 --> 35:22.996
The guy couldn't hurt a fly.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.748
Why the hell would
you lie to me?

35:24.790 --> 35:26.750
Because she wants
my inheritance.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.335
You're pathetic, Court.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.964
I came over to kick your ass
for screwing me over,

35:32.005 --> 35:33.090
but it's just too sad.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.257
What the hell are
you talking about?

35:34.299 --> 35:36.093
You think she's
been helping you?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.928
She's been trying
to steal my inheritance

35:37.970 --> 35:39.888
since the day my dad got sick.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.223
And she obviously started
sleeping with you so she could

35:42.265 --> 35:43.683
get dirt on me--
and it worked.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.602
Now even if I
tell my father

35:45.644 --> 35:47.938
about the two of you,
why should be believe me?

35:47.980 --> 35:49.230
She used you.

35:51.984 --> 35:54.903
That's unbelievable.

35:54.945 --> 35:57.238
Liam, I'm sorry.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.533
But I had a lot
of money on the line.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.202
For what it's worth,
I really do like you.

36:03.244 --> 36:05.288
(scoffs)

36:16.549 --> 36:18.093
Hey.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.971
You, too, huh?

36:21.013 --> 36:23.264
It's been one of those days.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.517
Yeah, tell me about it.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.811
Probably getting
kicked out of school,

36:27.853 --> 36:30.981
which means my academic
career is in the toilet.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.440
That sucks.

36:32.482 --> 36:34.818
And this is coming
from a girl

36:34.860 --> 36:37.195
who just lost
her best friend.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.907
Oh.

36:40.949 --> 36:43.118
What happened?

36:43.160 --> 36:45.871
Silver did what
she always does.

36:45.912 --> 36:49.415
And then I started doing
what I always do.

36:49.457 --> 36:53.336
And then I realized
I've changed.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.048
She hasn't. (laughs)

36:56.089 --> 36:58.175
(sighs)

37:00.135 --> 37:02.012
Can I ask you something?

37:02.054 --> 37:03.596
No.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.932
(both laugh)

37:05.974 --> 37:09.895
At some point, this all
gets easier, right?

37:09.936 --> 37:13.690
Because right now
it's pretty bad.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.608
Yeah.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.485
I'm sorry about Silver.

37:17.527 --> 37:19.988
I know it hurts.

37:20.030 --> 37:21.364
(sighs)

37:21.406 --> 37:25.326
I know it might be a crappy
consolation prize, but...

37:25.368 --> 37:27.412
you got me.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.251
You were never a
consolation prize.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.312
Hey.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.273
I didn't see you earlier.

37:55.314 --> 37:57.984
Yeah, um...

37:58.026 --> 38:00.779
Ade came by my place.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.406
I admit, I kissed her,

38:03.448 --> 38:05.909
but I only did it
to prove a point.

38:05.951 --> 38:06.993
I know.

38:07.035 --> 38:09.955
But the only point
that you proved was...

38:09.996 --> 38:12.540
that she's a way better
friend than I am.

38:12.582 --> 38:13.875
What do you mean?

38:13.917 --> 38:15.961
You guys talked, right--
got it all out in the open?

38:16.002 --> 38:17.087
Yeah, we talked,

38:17.129 --> 38:18.213
but, um...

38:18.255 --> 38:19.965
I was kind of hoping
that she'd yell at me

38:20.006 --> 38:21.883
and then, you know, I'd cry.

38:21.925 --> 38:25.137
And we'd hug and then we
could be friends again.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.888
But that didn't happen.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.225
I'm sorry for that.

38:30.267 --> 38:33.728
I really am,
but it's not your fault.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.189
You tried to do
the right thing

38:36.231 --> 38:37.816
and be honest,
and if she can't

38:37.857 --> 38:38.984
deal with that,

38:39.025 --> 38:40.860
maybe it's time to move on.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.656
Well, I kind of have no choice.

38:44.697 --> 38:47.575
You kind of do.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.661
I like you, Silver.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.580
And I'm pretty sure
you like me, too.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.457
Anyway...

38:54.499 --> 38:57.961
the ball's in your court.

39:14.602 --> 39:17.730
Hi. Never thought
I'd see you again.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.525
Uh, can we talk
about what happened?

39:20.566 --> 39:22.610
Yeah, come in.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.454
I am so sorry
I ruined your party

39:33.496 --> 39:35.332
and acted like a freak.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.001
Yes, all of those
things did happen.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.545
And I did all that because
I-I was so scared...

39:40.586 --> 39:42.672
I was so scared
to just tell you the truth

39:42.714 --> 39:44.674
and the truth is that...

39:44.716 --> 39:46.843
I really like you.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.845
But I'm a mess right now.

39:48.887 --> 39:52.473
I just got divorced,
and (sighs)

39:52.515 --> 39:55.601
the timing of this couldn't
be any worse, but...

39:55.643 --> 39:57.729
I should've told you
the truth nonetheless.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.605
Naomi, I like you, too.

39:59.647 --> 40:00.982
You do?

40:01.024 --> 40:02.067
Yes.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.109
In my defense,

40:03.151 --> 40:05.153
if I had known
Elizabeth was your sister,

40:05.195 --> 40:06.238
I never would've...

40:06.279 --> 40:07.906
Oh, yeah, that-that's on me.

40:07.947 --> 40:11.368
I... I didn't want anyone
to know we were related, so...

40:11.409 --> 40:14.162
Because she's so hideous?

40:14.204 --> 40:17.665
No, no, uh, my sister and I are
actually really close, it's just

40:17.707 --> 40:20.793
my... rest of my family
that's-that's the problem.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.461
And if you found out
she was my sister,

40:22.503 --> 40:23.546
I was afraid you
were gonna start

40:23.588 --> 40:25.548
asking questions
I wasn't ready to answer.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.592
And...

40:27.633 --> 40:30.303
I'm afraid that
when I do tell you the truth

40:30.345 --> 40:33.890
about my family, you...

40:33.932 --> 40:36.101
you might not want
to be involved with me.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.741
Can we talk about this?

40:51.783 --> 40:55.703
Why, so you can have something
to write about for the sequel?

40:55.745 --> 40:57.789
Liam, I'm really sorry.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.374
How did you think you were
gonna get away with this?

40:59.416 --> 41:00.959
Oh, if...
Uh, I mean seriously.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.419
Leo?

41:02.460 --> 41:04.421
You're messing with real
people's lives here.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.339
But if you would
just let me explain.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.549
Explain what?

41:08.591 --> 41:09.842
How you wrote about me?

41:09.884 --> 41:12.304
How you used me like everyone
other woman I've ever been

41:12.345 --> 41:13.430
involved with?

41:13.471 --> 41:17.558
I don't need
to know how this ends.

41:22.521 --> 41:24.565
(knock on door)

41:26.025 --> 41:27.819
(sighs)

41:30.738 --> 41:32.407
Patrick?

41:32.449 --> 41:34.492
We need to talk.
