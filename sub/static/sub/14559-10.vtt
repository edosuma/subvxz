WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:04.105
* You got no time
for the messenger *

00:04.138 --> 00:07.641
* Got no regard for the thing
that you don't understand *

00:07.675 --> 00:10.644
* You got no fear
of The Underdog *

00:10.678 --> 00:12.580
* That's why
you will not survive. *

00:12.613 --> 00:15.416
(rhythmic handclaps)

00:16.484 --> 00:17.585
Hey, Colby.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.053
SAC kicked this back.

00:19.087 --> 00:19.953
Again?

00:19.987 --> 00:20.821
Yeah, they want to
know where we're at

00:20.854 --> 00:22.423
on the Title 3s.
Okay?

00:22.456 --> 00:24.092
We're heading out.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.426
Oh, yeah, you going
to the stash house?

00:25.459 --> 00:26.627
Yeah. We're gonna
pick up breakfast first.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.595
Okay, egg whites on wheat,
please.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.330
Granger?

00:29.363 --> 00:30.664
Lumberjack special, double the
pancakes, please.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.166
What's going on?

00:32.200 --> 00:35.569
Oh, uh, Narcotics
is shorthanded.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.771
The SAC asked me to fill in
for a few weeks.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.074
They asked or you asked?

00:40.108 --> 00:42.376
I think it's better, don't you?

00:42.410 --> 00:44.578
Liz, it's not like I don't
think you're a good agent.

00:44.612 --> 00:45.813
I mean, I still
want you on the team.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.749
Yeah, I can't help but wonder if
you'd be saying the same thing

00:48.782 --> 00:49.817
if I was the one
who called it off.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.752
Hey, Don,
I got a judge

00:51.785 --> 00:52.853
on the phone
about the Title 3s,

00:52.886 --> 00:54.188
but he wants to talk to you.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.357
You know, I'm...

00:59.393 --> 01:00.594
You know when it comes
to promoting the book,

01:00.628 --> 01:02.296
I'll do anything
the publisher asks me to,

01:02.330 --> 01:04.698
but taking publicity pictures in
the middle of the FBI's bullpen

01:04.732 --> 01:06.634
- seems kind of tacky.
- What?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.636
Mathematician,
published author,

01:08.669 --> 01:10.704
FBI crime-solver.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.705
What's tacky about
being presented

01:11.739 --> 01:13.274
as the Renaissance
man you are?

01:13.307 --> 01:14.808
I don't know, I'm just
a tad bit worried

01:14.842 --> 01:16.877
that the more popular
the book gets,

01:16.910 --> 01:19.113
the farther it gets
away from the math.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.415
Yeah, well, if you want to
reach the widest audience,

01:21.449 --> 01:23.384
touch the most hearts,
you have to...

01:23.417 --> 01:24.485
Sell out.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.653
Sell a lot.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.688
(elevator bell dings)

01:27.721 --> 01:29.790
Going down.
(sighs)

01:29.823 --> 01:31.792
Did you ever notice
the first car you get

01:31.825 --> 01:32.960
is always going
the wrong way?

01:32.993 --> 01:35.863
Well, actually, the elevator
paradox accounts for that.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.166
See, any one elevator
spends most of its time

01:38.199 --> 01:39.767
in the larger section
of the building,

01:39.800 --> 01:41.535
so that's more than likely
the direction it's coming from

01:41.569 --> 01:42.770
when you hit
the call button.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.338
If we were to stand here
for several hours...

01:44.372 --> 01:45.873
(elevator bell dings)
Saved by the bell.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.212
Got Lakers tickets
for next Saturday.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.414
(gasps):
And Colby can't make it?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.416
As nice as it is to
be second choice,

01:55.449 --> 01:57.185
I'm going back east
for a couple weeks.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.486
Really?

01:58.519 --> 02:01.222
Larry mentioned that
he was headed back east as well.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.856
(laughs)

02:02.890 --> 02:04.492
I knew you two are
getting back together.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.227
Granger owes me 20.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.462
You bet on
me and Larry?

02:08.496 --> 02:10.398
You know,
I left my wallet upstairs.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.899
I'm serious.
I'll be right back.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.234
I'll meet you out front.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.671
- Whoa!
- Hey, there's a line!

02:17.705 --> 02:19.407
(metal detector beeping)
GUARD: Hey! Hey...

02:19.440 --> 02:20.741
(gunshots)

02:20.774 --> 02:22.710
(panicked shouting)
Move! Move!

02:22.743 --> 02:24.545
GUNMAN:
Back up!

02:24.578 --> 02:26.414
- Move! Back up!
- Drop the weapon!

02:26.447 --> 02:27.548
Drop the weapon
and let her go!

02:27.581 --> 02:28.549
It's not my fault!

02:28.582 --> 02:30.751
I acted in self-defense!

02:30.784 --> 02:31.919
Self-defense from who?

02:31.952 --> 02:32.920
- Who's trying to hurt you?
- From you!

02:32.953 --> 02:36.290
From all of you--
you won't leave me alone!

02:36.324 --> 02:38.292
Okay, you just, sir,
tell me what you need.

02:38.326 --> 02:41.529
What I need?!

02:41.562 --> 02:43.431
You need a hostage.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.366
(gasps)

02:45.399 --> 02:48.569
You need a hostage...

02:48.602 --> 02:49.770
now you have two.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.172
David?

02:53.274 --> 02:54.942
I'll kill her.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.744
Then I will kill you.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.979
Nobody wins.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.582
Too many things
to keep track of, you know.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.652
What's going on out there,
what's going on in here.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.720
It's hard to watch
both of us, you know.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.689
You're going
to make a mistake.

03:08.722 --> 03:12.293
You don't want
to make a mistake.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.868
I'll let her go
if you let the door go.

03:20.901 --> 03:21.735
No, we can't do that.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.504
Yes, we can. Yes.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.938
Yes, I will.

03:29.677 --> 03:33.281
(screams)

03:33.314 --> 03:35.616
I'm ready to die right now!
Are you?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.318
Are you?!

03:57.938 --> 03:59.740
(panting)

03:59.773 --> 04:02.510
Okay... what now?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.645
Just a minute of quiet, okay?

04:04.678 --> 04:06.280
Let me think.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.615
David Sinclair.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.517
What?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.785
While you're thinking,
you think about my name--

04:14.955 --> 04:17.458
David Sinclair.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.893
You have a name
maybe I can think about?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.964
Ben Blakely.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.966
Surveillance subcontractor.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.636
He's a wizard with wiretapping
and hidden cameras.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.603
MAN: All right,
let's go, fellas.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.806
Look alive.
I want rappel gear up on six.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.808
Special Operations Group
can only do so much,

04:34.842 --> 04:36.810
so sometimes
we have to outsource.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.313
He was working on
a RICO case for me,

04:39.347 --> 04:41.715
standard OC surveillance.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.851
Agent Devane, do you have any
idea why he would shoot at you?

04:43.884 --> 04:45.753
He started acting nutty,

04:45.786 --> 04:50.558
thought we were following him,
tapping his phones.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.793
So I had to let him go,

04:52.826 --> 04:54.362
revoke his clearance.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.929
Shutting him out of
all government contract work?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.965
I knew he was tightly wound,

04:57.998 --> 05:00.701
but I didn't see him
as the disgruntled shooter type.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.835
Obviously not.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.604
All right, would you follow
him off to the hospital.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.872
I'm going to need a
complete statement.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.006
DON:
What happened?

05:06.039 --> 05:06.840
I've got this ex-contractor

05:06.874 --> 05:08.075
who's having
paranoid fantasies...

05:08.108 --> 05:09.877
And what, David
trades himself?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.579
I mean, what's that about,
and why didn't you stop him?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.981
He made a judgment call.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.350
DON:
Yeah, well,

05:16.384 --> 05:17.551
not a very good one.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.819
Okay, you weren't there.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.887
And I wouldn't have
done it either,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.855
but he wasn't wrong.
He saved that woman's life.

05:21.889 --> 05:22.790
You're right, you're right.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.957
King, SWAT.
Car is stuck between floors

05:23.991 --> 05:25.726
so we're setting up positions
here and in the bullpen.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.960
Right.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.596
Is anybody opening up a line
of communication with Blakely?

05:28.629 --> 05:30.564
I'm going to give him
a couple minutes,

05:30.598 --> 05:31.765
let him think about
his situation.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.901
Maybe put in a psych
warfare soundtrack,

05:33.934 --> 05:35.903
shake up his world,
soften him up a little.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.606
Before we start isolating and
agitating a disturbed suspect,

05:38.639 --> 05:40.574
maybe we should let him
air his grievances,

05:40.608 --> 05:42.543
let him think that
we're listening to him.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.977
DON:
I agree.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.546
Hey, you can go through
the motions if you want,

05:45.579 --> 05:46.680
but we're going
to end up assaulting.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.815
It's just the way it goes.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.617
Just set your positions.
No moves until I say, all right?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.685
Why don't you get a line
on Blakely, his background.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.887
Liz, I want you to go to the
hospital, all right?

06:06.033 --> 06:09.002
So somebody just walked into the
FBI and started shooting people?

06:09.036 --> 06:12.172
Yeah, seems to happen every
year or two around here.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.141
Actually, if you consider
the number of people

06:14.174 --> 06:15.576
carrying guns in the city

06:15.609 --> 06:16.877
and account for the amount
of criminals

06:16.910 --> 06:18.412
associated with this building,

06:18.446 --> 06:19.980
even weighted against
the security measures...

06:20.013 --> 06:22.616
I suppose they deal with this
stuff all the time here, huh?

06:22.650 --> 06:24.051
David is going to be okay?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.553
Probabilistically.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.920
So what do we do now?

06:26.954 --> 06:28.889
What? We just wait?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.190
Until they need me.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.925
What are they going
to need you for?

06:31.959 --> 06:33.994
There's always something.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.864
What-what is
that, Charlie?

06:36.897 --> 06:37.965
It's a thought.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.770
More of an abstract notion.

06:42.803 --> 06:43.604
Yeah, about what?

06:43.637 --> 06:46.907
About getting David
out of there.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.842
You know what's
going on out there?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.077
Guns, cops,

06:50.110 --> 06:51.679
more guns.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.881
Your people are getting ready
to kill me.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.215
They don't want to.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.184
Yes, they do.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.523
What was your plan, Ben?

07:02.556 --> 07:04.558
You thought you'd come
in here shooting

07:04.592 --> 07:06.494
and walk out the front door?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.095
I didn't have a plan.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.863
I didn't think.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.699
I just wanted it to stop.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.166
I told Devane,
over and over again.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.602
And who's Devane?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.537
Okay, and what did you tell him?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.872
The FBI guy I shot.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.075
I told him to stop following me.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.212
He had people spying on me.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.914
Do you know
what that's like,

07:26.947 --> 07:28.516
to never have
any privacy?

07:28.549 --> 07:31.752
Always wonder who's watching
you, and from where?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.821
(over P.A.):
This is Don Eppes.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.023
To talk to me, you just push
the call button

07:36.056 --> 07:38.659
on the panel there.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.061
Now, sir, I want you
to understand two things:

07:41.094 --> 07:43.964
We want you to surrender,
and I will do anything necessary

07:43.997 --> 07:46.534
to ensure the safety
of Agent Sinclair.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.602
The first step

07:48.636 --> 07:52.606
is for us to just
start talking, now, okay?

07:52.640 --> 07:56.577
What you want right now, Ben,
is time.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.211
You need time to think.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.248
If you don't answer up,

08:01.281 --> 08:04.051
you're going to push everybody
out there to act faster.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.523
That is exactly
what you don't want.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.931
He's fine.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.099
Tell them.
Tell them you're fine.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.068
Everything's fine in here, Don.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.903
DAVID: Everybody's keeping
a level head.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.539
Mr. Blakely,
you've got to understand,

08:25.573 --> 08:27.074
sooner or later, you're going
to come out of there.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.512
What do you want
to do, Ben?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.855
DON:
Ben? Ben?!

08:41.889 --> 08:43.657
BLAKELY:
I don't want to talk right now.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.826
And I don't like being watched.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.131
He terminated contact.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.933
Playbook says we shut down
the air-conditioning,

08:52.966 --> 08:54.101
kill the lights,

08:54.134 --> 08:55.936
run a fiber optic line
to the car,

08:55.969 --> 08:57.070
restore our visual.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.872
Uh, actually, Don,

08:58.906 --> 09:01.775
you're better off
not looking inside the elevator.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.712
This must be the math brother.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.814
Exactly what made you come
to that conclusion?

09:06.847 --> 09:08.816
You're not an FBI agent,
but you walked in here like one.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.083
Look, he earned
that walk, okay?

09:10.117 --> 09:11.251
What were you
going to say?

09:11.284 --> 09:12.185
It's a classic
thought experiment

09:12.219 --> 09:13.654
called the Chinese Room,

09:13.687 --> 09:16.089
in which there's a computer
inside a room

09:16.123 --> 09:18.726
receiving questions
written in Chinese characters

09:18.759 --> 09:20.928
that it answers back in Chinese.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.896
It's programmed so perfect
that the questioner

09:22.930 --> 09:25.633
thinks he's talking
to an actual person,

09:25.666 --> 09:27.000
which is called the Turing test.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.670
Now, imagine there's a man
inside the room

09:29.703 --> 09:32.239
who doesn't speak Chinese
but answers the questions back

09:32.272 --> 09:34.975
using the same rules
as the computer,

09:35.008 --> 09:37.778
writing back
predetermined responses.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.280
John Searle argued
that you can't get meaning

09:40.313 --> 09:42.182
from a blind manipulation
of symbols,

09:42.215 --> 09:44.151
while others argued
that semantics...

09:44.184 --> 09:46.954
I get that the elevator is
the Chinese Room, right?

09:46.987 --> 09:48.255
Who's the computer?

09:48.288 --> 09:50.123
Uh, it's not about
the Turing test.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.693
than that.'s far more abstract

09:52.726 --> 09:54.361
I don't get it. I mean, more
data is always better, Charlie,

09:54.394 --> 09:55.963
so why not look?

09:55.996 --> 09:58.365
I'm pointing out that there
are programmed responses

09:58.398 --> 10:00.968
logical to both
David and Blakely...

10:01.001 --> 10:02.703
How long to get a camera in
there?

10:02.736 --> 10:03.704
Ten minutes.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.372
We get a visual, we put
an armor-piercing round

10:05.405 --> 10:06.807
through the thinnest wall.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.642
Not the nicest way
to resolve this thing,

10:08.676 --> 10:10.177
but it's the fastest.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.679
You can't guarantee
you're going to kill the guy

10:11.712 --> 10:12.846
before he pulls the trigger.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.715
Even if I could, I wouldn't.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.184
All right,
just put the camera in for now.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.720
I've been helping you
for four years.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.288
You know, I haven't been wrong
too many times.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.223
I mean, this isn't just some...

10:23.256 --> 10:24.391
Some thought experiment?

10:26.894 --> 10:29.296
WOMAN:
I don't believe it, not Ben.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.999
He witnesses life,
he doesn't live it.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.200
Did you notice
any warning signs--

10:33.233 --> 10:35.335
erratic behavior,
increased agitation?

10:35.368 --> 10:38.005
He showed all of those signs,

10:38.038 --> 10:39.840
especially before
our divorce.

10:39.873 --> 10:43.911
Our son died in a car accident
seven years ago.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.279
After that, he just disappeared
into his work.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.281
I think watching
other people

10:48.315 --> 10:50.718
made him feel
less lonely somehow.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.220
He seems to think
that he's being watched.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.122
He's thought that for 25 years.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.825
Sweeping the apartment for bugs,
avoiding store cameras.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.693
I think when you know
how easy it is

10:59.727 --> 11:01.394
to take somebody else's
privacy away,

11:01.428 --> 11:03.731
you're just that much more
sensitive about your own.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.866
Do you think there's any way you
could get through to him?

11:05.899 --> 11:10.237
Agent Reeves, I don't think
I can help you with Ben.

11:10.270 --> 11:14.107
He's as much a mystery to me
as anybody else.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.846
It's... it's getting hot
in here.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.782
Probably a safety
mechanism--

11:21.815 --> 11:24.217
save power during
a malfunction.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.157
What do you think
they're doing out there?

11:32.125 --> 11:35.295
Trying to find a way
to end this peacefully.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.838
(grunts)

11:57.117 --> 11:59.219
The agent you shot...

11:59.252 --> 12:01.721
Devane.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.194
He thought
I wouldn't find out.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.395
Find out what?

12:08.428 --> 12:11.364
That they were following me,
spying on me.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.234
Why?

12:24.177 --> 12:28.816
He destroyed my life's work...
to cover up his...

12:28.849 --> 12:31.418
Cover up what?

12:31.451 --> 12:33.020
DON:
Ben.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.389
Hey...

12:36.423 --> 12:38.158
(mutters):
Sons of bitches...

12:38.191 --> 12:39.426
What was Devane
trying to cover up?

12:39.459 --> 12:40.460
Eppes!

12:40.493 --> 12:41.895
Hey, Ben, stay with... Ben!

12:41.929 --> 12:43.263
Eppes!

12:43.296 --> 12:44.464
Yeah, Ben, what's up?

12:44.497 --> 12:46.934
Do you really think you can pull
a fiber optic snake past me?

12:49.302 --> 12:50.437
You pull it.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.438
Pull it!

12:51.471 --> 12:52.806
Ben, listen to me...

12:52.840 --> 12:55.042
I don't care
if we both die in here!

12:55.075 --> 12:56.376
Ten, nine...

12:56.409 --> 12:58.378
Ben, you are going
to make me shoot you!

12:58.411 --> 13:00.547
Then do it. Do it right now--
we'll both die.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.449
Ben, calm down, okay?
It's just a camera.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.984
I will not be watched!

13:04.017 --> 13:05.152
Don't back yourself
into a corner!

13:05.185 --> 13:06.153
You don't have to do this!

13:06.186 --> 13:07.387
...seven,
Easy, Ben!

13:07.420 --> 13:08.889
six...

13:12.525 --> 13:14.928
I will not be watched!

13:14.962 --> 13:15.795
Five!

13:15.829 --> 13:18.365
You can't do it, Eppes--
Negotiation 101.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.201
- Four, three...
- Blakely, lower your gun!

13:21.234 --> 13:22.802
I'm pulling it.
Pull it!

13:24.404 --> 13:26.206
All the way out!

13:26.239 --> 13:27.807
It's out. It's out.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.578
(gasping)

13:38.551 --> 13:40.954
Okay... okay.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.455
All right.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.259
Okay.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.195
You realize we just told
wingnut he's in charge.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.063
Maybe we should try some
passive surveillance.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.198
Thermal imaging?

13:51.231 --> 13:53.266
Yeah, we can read heat
signatures through the walls,

13:53.300 --> 13:55.468
but the problem is,
it's not enough information

13:55.502 --> 13:56.904
to give us a clean shot.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.538
Well, it's better than nothing.

13:58.571 --> 13:59.706
Not according to your brother.

13:59.739 --> 14:03.610
Everything I heard about
the guy, he's like a magician.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.513
Are all his ideas
so out there?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.215
Yeah, sometimes.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.083
Should we be thinking about it?

14:12.585 --> 14:15.488
Rib stopped one, and, uh...

14:15.522 --> 14:17.324
the other was
a through-and-through.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.526
Good thing he wasn't
a better shot, huh?

14:19.559 --> 14:20.928
You know, something's

14:20.961 --> 14:23.163
just not making sense
about Ben Blakely.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.599
He profiles as volatile
and paranoid,

14:26.633 --> 14:28.135
but none of the bellwethers

14:28.168 --> 14:30.070
of explosive, violent action
are there.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.005
Meaning what?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.140
Meaning he was ripe
for an episode,

14:33.173 --> 14:34.574
but something set him off.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.543
I'm guessing that something,
you're not telling me?

14:36.576 --> 14:38.578
Is she for real?

14:38.611 --> 14:42.049
As real as the files we accessed
on your RICO case,

14:42.082 --> 14:43.650
the SAC shut it down

14:43.683 --> 14:45.585
six weeks
before you fired Blakely.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.922
So what exactly has
he been doing for six weeks?

14:48.956 --> 14:52.926
Blakely already had surveillance
cameras and wiretaps set up

14:52.960 --> 14:54.594
with a dozen organized
crime figures.

14:54.627 --> 14:58.498
I let him keep recording
until the warrants expired.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.567
I figured I might get lucky.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.436
Unauthorized use of Bureau funds
for an unapproved activity?

15:03.470 --> 15:06.573
I mean, come on, that's
a hell of a disciplinary review.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.175
They're going to have
to move fast.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.276
I'm retiring
at the end of the month.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.444
Look, I rolled the bones,

15:11.478 --> 15:13.580
tried to go out on a win
instead of a loss,

15:13.613 --> 15:16.216
and it blew up in my face.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.585
You think two bullets isn't
punishment enough,

15:18.618 --> 15:21.388
then report me.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.589
LIZ:
You know, those interrogations

15:22.622 --> 15:25.525
where the subject is telling
you just enough of the truth

15:25.558 --> 15:27.494
to make it hard to tell
where the lie starts?

15:27.527 --> 15:29.629
I think he made
a bad judgment call,

15:29.662 --> 15:31.431
and now he's just trying
to cover his ass.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.033
An internal investigation's
gonna have to

15:33.066 --> 15:34.634
find the truth
eventually.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.170
Yeah, but David doesn't have
"eventually" kind of time.

15:37.204 --> 15:40.040
I think we have to go open up
Ben Blakely's head

15:40.073 --> 15:42.242
and get a good look inside.

15:48.581 --> 15:52.619
So... how long you been
in surveillance?

15:52.652 --> 15:55.388
Twenty-five years.

15:55.422 --> 16:01.128
I made the tra...
the transition from...

16:01.161 --> 16:05.298
from analog to digital...

16:05.332 --> 16:09.669
reel to reel and directional
microphones to laser switchers

16:09.702 --> 16:11.638
and omnidirectional receivers.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.739
Not a lot of us did.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.274
Yeah.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.643
Must've seen and heard
a whole hell of a lot, huh?

16:16.676 --> 16:19.479
No, not really.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.382
It's just information,
to be packaged and moved on.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.617
I... I hear it,
but I never listen.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.718
I find that hard to believe.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.554
Twenty-five years?

16:27.587 --> 16:28.755
Exactly.

16:28.788 --> 16:32.759
All those voices,
all those words...

16:32.792 --> 16:35.428
if I had listened to all of it,
if I had listened to any of it,

16:35.462 --> 16:38.365
I'd have gone...

16:41.268 --> 16:43.536
I'm not crazy, you know.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.538
The FBI has been watching me.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.140
I can prove it.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.009
How?

16:53.280 --> 16:56.516
It doesn't matter, does it?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.818
If you were working for Devane,
right,

16:58.851 --> 17:01.154
and he had everything
you recorded...

17:01.188 --> 17:03.123
why watch you?

17:04.457 --> 17:05.592
I don't know...

17:05.625 --> 17:07.594
All right.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.528
And where was killing him
going to get you?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.597
I mean, it wouldn't get you
any answers.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.300
Oh, maybe it would.

17:13.333 --> 17:17.670
Maybe now, someone will tell me
why I was being watched.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.640
Or maybe...

17:20.673 --> 17:25.745
maybe all I want is this moment,
right now,

17:25.778 --> 17:28.715
with no one watching me.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.287
(labored breathing)

17:34.321 --> 17:36.856
I couldn't sleep...

17:36.889 --> 17:40.293
knowing they were listening.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.762
I...

17:42.795 --> 17:45.665
I just...

17:45.698 --> 17:47.600
I'm just tired
all the time now.

17:47.634 --> 17:52.639
I can't focus.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.184
Okay, the thermal camera's in.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.554
Car's too small-- the heat
signatures are blurring.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.621
Even if they haven't
changed positions,

18:08.655 --> 18:10.723
I still can't advise
taking a shot.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.729
I don't see
what we can do but insert.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.299
How many times have I been there
for him? How many?

18:19.332 --> 18:20.800
And he interrupted me.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.802
He cut me off,
like I'm some kind of...

18:22.835 --> 18:24.504
- Consultant?
- Okay, fine,

18:24.537 --> 18:26.406
but he didn't have to act
like the-the...

18:26.439 --> 18:27.407
The boss.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.476
I'm getting subtle clues
that you're on his side.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.910
No, no, no.
No sides.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.514
It's just that you're both
in a very stressful situation.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.816
You have to admit,
the idea

18:36.849 --> 18:38.818
of not looking inside
the elevator,

18:38.851 --> 18:41.921
given the circumstance,
it's a little, uh... Zen.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.856
Zen, radical, maybe,
but, you know, he didn't

18:43.890 --> 18:45.825
even allow me to formulate
the argument.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.760
I mean, I know I'm right.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.429
That's not even true.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.697
I failed.

18:50.730 --> 18:54.401
I failed to make
myself understood.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.535
Sometimes there are things
in my head that are

18:55.568 --> 18:57.670
so purely what they are...

18:57.704 --> 19:00.307
that when I try to turn
them into words,

19:00.340 --> 19:04.411
they either are no words,
or I just don't know how.

19:04.444 --> 19:09.249
And... you can't imagine
how that feels.

19:09.282 --> 19:13.620
How hard it is to have an idea
and not be able to share it.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.588
Hey, can you do me a favor,
come take a look at something?

19:15.622 --> 19:18.391
Yeah, sure.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.364
DON: This is the image
from the elevator.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.898
I need to know if there's
any way of reading these things

19:25.932 --> 19:27.767
that I don't know of.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.868
I don't know, maybe.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.737
If you would allow me to try

19:30.770 --> 19:31.738
to explain the Chinese Room
theory--

19:31.771 --> 19:33.473
No, no, no.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.375
Listen to me, okay?
We're going to assault.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.344
What I need to know,
is there anything

19:37.377 --> 19:39.846
that I can do to improve
David's chances?

19:39.879 --> 19:43.550
Yeah. Of course.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.255
I can do something.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.722
I can't guarantee
it'll be enough.

19:49.756 --> 19:53.360
Whatever you can do,
I would appreciate it, okay?

19:57.597 --> 20:00.767
You know, when
I was a kid, um,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.735
we lived in this brownstone.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.471
When the phone would
ring downstairs,

20:04.504 --> 20:05.872
you know,
I'd pick it up.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.607
If it was one of my older
sister's boyfriends,

20:07.640 --> 20:11.010
you know, she'd, she'd take it
on the upstairs extension.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.447
I never really cared what they
were talking about.

20:14.481 --> 20:17.917
I couldn't help but listen in,
you know?

20:17.950 --> 20:21.354
It's the human urge--
to light up the dark corners,

20:21.388 --> 20:23.590
look for answers
in other people.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.898
But at the end of the day,
there are no answers there,

20:31.931 --> 20:36.603
just more lives as sad
and singular as our own.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.738
That's why you stopped
listening?

20:40.507 --> 20:42.942
What answers were
you looking for, Ben?

20:46.346 --> 20:50.617
You know, I don't think
anyone understands loss

20:50.650 --> 20:53.853
until they've lost a child...

20:53.886 --> 20:55.955
not really.

20:55.988 --> 21:00.527
And once you truly
understand loss,

21:00.560 --> 21:05.264
you realize it's worth anything
to never feel it again.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.503
I stopped listening, Sinclair,

21:10.537 --> 21:12.472
because I didn't have
the strength

21:12.505 --> 21:15.074
to take their pain, too.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.777
So why didn't you just quit?

21:17.810 --> 21:19.446
Just walk away?

21:19.479 --> 21:22.081
Twenty-five years, Sinclair.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.551
I don't know anything else.

21:28.888 --> 21:29.889
More coffee...

21:29.922 --> 21:31.991
and I found some, uh,

21:32.024 --> 21:33.893
well, some kind of cookies.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.828
It seems like I spend
half my life bringing

21:35.862 --> 21:38.931
you boys food
and beverages, you know?

21:38.965 --> 21:40.900
K-means cluster analysis.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.702
It's hard to believe
that there was

21:42.735 --> 21:45.705
a time when I considered
myself math literate.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.707
Well, the process
can get complex,

21:47.740 --> 21:48.975
but the concept's
fairly simple.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.744
You know, David and Blakely
are throwing off

21:51.778 --> 21:53.646
two coinciding heat signatures--

21:53.680 --> 21:56.115
like two schools of fish
passing through each other,

21:56.148 --> 21:58.751
looking to the naked eye
like a single group,

21:58.785 --> 22:01.721
but when you analyze the data
continuously-- examine

22:01.754 --> 22:04.424
the movement and behavior
of each individual fish--

22:04.457 --> 22:06.125
you can separate
the two clusters.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.627
And figure out which
one is David,

22:07.660 --> 22:09.562
and which one is the,
uh, crazy guy.

22:09.596 --> 22:10.997
Well, first I have to separate
the heat signatures.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.099
You know, discerning which one
is which

22:13.132 --> 22:15.001
requires a whole other analysis
of height

22:15.034 --> 22:16.569
and weight and body type.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.572
Son of a gun.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.841
I know this elevator.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.943
Been on it enough times.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.845
No, I mean
it's a Schindler 400A.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.014
The Convention Center project
I've been consulting on

22:28.047 --> 22:29.649
has four of them.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.117
I need to talk to Don.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.922
MEGAN: I didn't know there were
this many ways

22:35.955 --> 22:37.089
to spy on a person.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.525
Really.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.159
Okay, so where do
we start looking?

22:40.192 --> 22:41.961
And what are we looking for?

22:41.994 --> 22:43.996
I'd skip all the raw
surveillance material

22:44.030 --> 22:45.765
and the work stuff for now.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.133
We're looking for a letter,

22:47.166 --> 22:48.935
or an emotional trigger
of some kind.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.603
Okay.

22:50.637 --> 22:51.938
Or course there's almost

22:51.971 --> 22:53.640
nothing personal in here.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.107
There's not one
photograph,

22:55.141 --> 22:58.945
or one knickknack.

22:58.978 --> 23:03.049
It's like he's consciously
burying all of his memories.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.817
I got a file folder

23:04.851 --> 23:06.719
labeled "Them."

23:06.753 --> 23:08.555
Now we're talking paranoia.

23:08.588 --> 23:09.922
Is it like a list

23:09.956 --> 23:10.957
of grievances?

23:10.990 --> 23:12.592
What is that?

23:12.625 --> 23:14.026
Video files,

23:14.060 --> 23:15.528
I think.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.135
Just 'cause you're
paranoid doesn't mean

23:23.169 --> 23:24.971
that everyone
isn't watching.

23:30.943 --> 23:34.046
ALAN:
Okay. This pulley system here

23:34.080 --> 23:36.215
is called
the Overspeed Governor.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.718
It keeps the elevator
from dropping too fast.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.053
Yeah, we can drop
the car anytime you want.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.555
But if you override
the emergency brake,

23:42.589 --> 23:43.856
the car will start moving slowly

23:43.890 --> 23:45.124
because that's what
it's designed to do.

23:45.157 --> 23:48.094
Well, that would give Blakely
plenty of time to shoot David.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.730
But if you reset
the Overspeed Governor,

23:50.763 --> 23:52.131
raise its maximum speed...

23:52.164 --> 23:53.933
Diversion, right?

23:53.966 --> 23:56.035
How far you think it will drop?

23:56.068 --> 23:57.937
No more than five or six feet.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.906
KING: So we drop the box,
my guys go in

23:59.939 --> 24:01.808
while they're still
rattled, right?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.109
Still a lot of risk, guys.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.645
Well, less if we know
where they both are.

24:07.614 --> 24:08.815
DAVID:
I don't know about you,

24:08.848 --> 24:12.118
hey, but...
but I'm getting hungry.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.786
Yeah, sure.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.121
Drugged food.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.189
A chance for them
to drop in some tear gas.

24:17.223 --> 24:20.827
Hey, Ben, nothing makes them
more nervous than silence, okay?

24:20.860 --> 24:23.029
You got to start putting
some demands out there.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.697
Open the lines
of communication.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.599
You want them to stay outside,

24:26.633 --> 24:29.168
you got to get them talking
here in this room.

24:29.201 --> 24:32.004
Well, I'm supposed
to take your advice?

24:32.038 --> 24:35.207
Man, if they don't think
there's any reasoning with you,

24:35.241 --> 24:37.176
they're going
to bring this elevator down

24:37.209 --> 24:41.180
to the ground floor,
and they are going to breach it.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.516
Even if we haven't shot
each other by then,

24:43.550 --> 24:46.018
I do not want to be
in the line of fire.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.256
Ben...

24:50.289 --> 24:53.125
do you want to live?

24:57.329 --> 24:58.898
I'll put it another way.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.199
(crying)

25:00.232 --> 25:01.734
You want to live.

25:01.768 --> 25:04.103
(sniffling)

25:04.136 --> 25:05.271
That's why you
shot Devane.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.273
To protect
yourself.

25:07.306 --> 25:10.677
'Cause you wanted things
to go back the way they were.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.279
But you didn't think
this thing through,

25:13.312 --> 25:17.650
so now it's up to me
to help you out, okay?

25:17.684 --> 25:20.219
Ben, I am going
to walk you out of here.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.254
I'm going to go to jail.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.690
Yeah.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.092
Probably.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.294
Eight by eight box,

25:28.327 --> 25:30.296
24/7

25:30.329 --> 25:34.200
with no privacy, huh?

25:34.233 --> 25:36.135
How do you think I'd do?

25:40.139 --> 25:44.310
So, maybe you're wrong.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.213
Maybe living isn't my best bet.

25:50.316 --> 25:53.252
He has dozens of
files like this.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.987
Yeah, he's Warspying.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.155
Just when I'm convinced

25:56.188 --> 25:57.056
you can't come up
with something new.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.225
Most video
surveillance cameras operate

25:59.258 --> 26:00.760
and broadcast on unprotected,

26:00.793 --> 26:02.328
2.4 gigahertz
video feeds.

26:02.361 --> 26:03.930
DON: You're talking like
Wi-Fi, right?

26:03.963 --> 26:06.833
Exactly, and
intercepting those feeds

26:06.866 --> 26:08.868
requires a video receiver,

26:08.901 --> 26:10.603
an omni-directional antenna,
really not much else.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.271
It's probably hidden
in his briefcase.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.273
All right,
so he sweeps his loft--

26:14.306 --> 26:15.908
probably a routine check
for bugs...

26:15.942 --> 26:17.243
Realized he is being watched,

26:17.276 --> 26:18.778
unlocking all the
paranoid fantasies,

26:18.811 --> 26:20.947
exacerbating the
privacy issues.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.214
All right, so who the hell
is watching the guy?

26:22.248 --> 26:24.183
CHARLIE: Can't tell you that,
but I can tell you where from,

26:24.216 --> 26:25.885
give or take 35 feet.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.386
How?

26:27.419 --> 26:28.320
It's like any other signal,
okay?

26:28.354 --> 26:29.488
It-it gets stronger

26:29.521 --> 26:32.091
as you get closer to the
receiver and the transmitter,

26:32.124 --> 26:33.726
gets weaker
as you get farther away.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.961
You plot enough points

26:34.994 --> 26:36.896
where the image is clear,
and you apply

26:36.929 --> 26:38.297
inverse geometry.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.099
Uh, like fireflies
flickering on and off

26:40.132 --> 26:41.433
during a summer night,

26:41.467 --> 26:43.670
apparently random blinks
of light in the darkness,

26:43.703 --> 26:47.206
but math reveals
their true path and purpose:

26:47.239 --> 26:49.108
what trees
they've laid eggs beneath;

26:49.141 --> 26:50.409
where they've gone to mate,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.745
bringing rhythm and pattern
to their light show.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.346
DON: All right, let's just focus

26:54.380 --> 26:56.382
on the thermal image, all right?

26:56.415 --> 26:58.818
This program doesn't need me
to finish its work for it.

26:58.851 --> 26:59.919
And given the wealth of data,

26:59.952 --> 27:01.854
the geometry should take,
like, 15 or 20 minutes.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.723
Good idea...
about the elevator.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.357
You know, I-I feel
kind of funny

27:05.391 --> 27:07.326
about being
so involved here, and, uh,

27:07.359 --> 27:09.361
if anything should happen...

27:09.395 --> 27:11.063
Well, it won't.

27:11.097 --> 27:14.400
You know, I'm a little old
for hollow reassurances, Colby.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.035
You see, this was my idea,

27:16.068 --> 27:18.437
and if David gets hurt,
I am responsible for that.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.773
Oh, yeah, that's true.

27:20.807 --> 27:23.409
Some hollow reassurance
would be nice now.

27:23.442 --> 27:26.946
Look, Alan,
there's no instruction manual

27:26.979 --> 27:28.848
for how we handle
these situations.

27:28.881 --> 27:29.882
I mean, not really.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.751
You know, we make
our best guesses out there,

27:31.784 --> 27:34.020
and, you know,
we just hope.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.088
So, how do you wrestle
with that?

27:36.122 --> 27:38.190
Having to make
these big decisions,

27:38.224 --> 27:41.961
having people's lives
literally in your hands?

27:41.994 --> 27:43.896
I mean, sure,
it's not every day

27:43.930 --> 27:46.432
that your best friend's life
is on the line, but...

27:46.465 --> 27:49.201
Actually, a lot of days it is.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.139
CHARLIE:
Based on body type, a small

27:53.172 --> 27:54.240
height differential,

27:54.273 --> 27:56.709
and allowing for inaccuracies in
the cluster analysis,

27:56.743 --> 27:59.111
I can say that
this is David,

27:59.145 --> 28:01.480
but I can say that with
only 65% certainty.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.049
Yeah, well,
that's a big 35%.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.984
And that's why I can't
advise going in.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.919
All right, wait,
but somebody's got to ask.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.354
Chinese Room say?

28:08.387 --> 28:09.421
All right.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.057
It's an analysis of
Blakely's stated objectives

28:11.090 --> 28:13.826
and David's impact
on his environment.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.362
It's, it's a weighted matrix of
risk-reward, all right, so...

28:16.395 --> 28:18.030
Hold-hold on a second.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.066
Can't you do all that stuff
and still see in the box?

28:20.099 --> 28:22.001
No. The act
of observation creates...

28:22.034 --> 28:25.337
creates a relationship
between the-the viewer

28:25.371 --> 28:27.239
and-and the
subject, all right?

28:27.273 --> 28:29.508
I can't tell you why
I know what I know.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.910
Unfortunately,
not in any way

28:30.943 --> 28:32.144
that you'd
understand, but-but...

28:32.178 --> 28:33.846
but I'm hoping to arrive

28:33.880 --> 28:36.182
at a persuasive strategy
before it's too late, okay?

28:36.215 --> 28:37.784
Yeah, well,
it's too late.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.352
I mean, look, no demands,
the guy's refusing to negotiate.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.354
Okay? We cannot
wait any longer.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.489
Elevator's ready to drop.

28:43.522 --> 28:44.824
DON:
All right.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.893
Any way
to give your guy a heads-up?

28:46.926 --> 28:48.394
Yeah. Our distress
word is Mexico.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.428
Mexico.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.831
Yeah, let's do it.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.868
Don. Charlie.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.873
Look, I want
to go in there.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.842
Okay, David
is my partner.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.811
I know his moves
better than anyone.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.179
I can make sure these
guys don't overreact.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.982
Don, tell me
the argument to make.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.483
I will make it.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.552
All right, you go
in behind SWAT,

29:13.585 --> 29:16.923
same as any
other action.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.058
Got to give up
on this one, buddy.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.194
I didn't get where I am
by giving up on being right.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.564
(beep)
Ben, this is Don Eppes.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.133
How are we doing in there?

29:31.137 --> 29:33.973
Everything's fine, Don.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.441
Everybody's good.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.844
Could maybe, uh, use some water,
some sandwiches...

29:37.877 --> 29:39.545
No! No one comes in.
DON: Ben, listen to me.

29:39.578 --> 29:40.913
We've been in your loft.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.081
We saw the video.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.482
We know someone
was following you.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.584
(whirring)

29:45.617 --> 29:47.019
Someone.

29:47.053 --> 29:48.254
We're going
to help you figure out who.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.589
I promise you this.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.925
You know who. I put bullets
in the son of a bitch!

29:52.959 --> 29:54.093
You tell me why!

29:54.126 --> 29:55.594
Well, come on out,

29:55.627 --> 29:56.829
and we'll figure
it out together.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.464
(whirring)

29:58.497 --> 30:00.833
Oh, you'll whitewash everything.

30:00.867 --> 30:04.103
You'll protect your own,
throw me in a cell,

30:04.136 --> 30:06.305
and then stare at me.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.507
And what will it all
have been for?

30:08.540 --> 30:12.044
DON:
What is it all for?

30:12.078 --> 30:15.181
Ben, you've got
to talk to me here.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.221
Ben, I want to help you.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.291
David wants to help you,
but you got to be realistic

30:25.324 --> 30:28.527
about your situation.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.898
Ben, you're in an elevator.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.301
You can't just walk out...

30:38.404 --> 30:40.306
...hop on a plane to Mexico.

30:42.374 --> 30:43.309
Now!

30:44.576 --> 30:45.878
(rumbling)

30:47.013 --> 30:47.513
Hold it!

30:47.546 --> 30:48.514
(gunshot)

30:48.547 --> 30:49.581
(gunshots)

30:49.615 --> 30:50.917
(grunts)

30:50.950 --> 30:52.551
(gunshots)

30:52.584 --> 30:54.253
(grunts)

30:54.286 --> 30:56.288
No! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

31:02.694 --> 31:04.931
(labored breathing)

31:08.935 --> 31:10.336
COLBY: He's got a
through-and-through

31:10.369 --> 31:11.503
on the left shoulder,

31:11.537 --> 31:12.538
but otherwise stable.

31:12.571 --> 31:13.639
BLAKELY:
It didn't work, Eppes!

31:13.672 --> 31:16.142
I have both guns now.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.977
I'm in control now.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.145
You tell them!

31:19.178 --> 31:20.646
You tell them.

31:20.679 --> 31:25.051
Everything's status quo, Don.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.185
(panting)

31:26.218 --> 31:27.486
Why?

31:27.519 --> 31:29.155
Why are you lying?

31:29.188 --> 31:31.991
I'm not going to give you
the power you want, Ben.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.225
Not until I think

31:33.259 --> 31:35.061
you're going
to make the right decision.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.096
But I have both guns.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.330
You're still in
the same position.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.666
You shoot me,
you're as good as dead.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.368
(loud, pained grunt)

31:42.401 --> 31:45.071
Oh, it feels like I've
been kicked in the ribs.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.305
(grunts)

31:46.338 --> 31:49.241
Not that I'm complaining about
a bulletproof vest working now.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.143
What the hell you doing
shutting the door?

31:51.177 --> 31:53.012
Trying to keep your men
from killing my partner.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.446
You got no business jumping to
the front of the action.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.514
Hey!

31:55.547 --> 31:56.983
My men are
trained.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.350
Trained to do what,
shoot too fast?

31:58.384 --> 31:59.918
Guys! Later.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.323
Oh, you should talk
to your brother.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.325
He may be out there,
but at least

32:06.358 --> 32:07.994
he's got a plan
he's willing to stick with.

32:09.996 --> 32:10.929
(David gasps)

32:10.963 --> 32:13.099
At least we know
where we both stand, huh?

32:13.132 --> 32:15.467
(panting)

32:15.501 --> 32:16.602
You tried to kill me.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.304
DAVID:
Really?

32:18.337 --> 32:20.339
I-I distinctly remember

32:20.372 --> 32:23.409
not shooting you
when I could have.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.677
(panting)
(electrical fizzing)

32:31.017 --> 32:32.184
(knocking)
About time.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.186
I ordered a half an hour ago.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.355
LIZ: Oh, you owe us $15.
- Fifteen?

32:36.388 --> 32:38.357
You tipped generously.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.526
We need to talk to you
about Ben Blakely.

32:40.559 --> 32:41.994
Ben who?

32:42.028 --> 32:43.395
You know, that guy

32:43.429 --> 32:45.131
you've been following
around the city videotaping.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.999
you obviouslyll, since

32:47.033 --> 32:48.600
don't have a lie handy,

32:48.634 --> 32:50.202
you should know

32:50.236 --> 32:52.438
that Blakely's holding a federal
agent at gunpoint, okay?

32:52.471 --> 32:54.306
So we're just a little
short on patience.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.708
Wow. This is some
hobby you got here.

32:56.742 --> 33:00.446
Well, I gross 200K a year.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.048
I mean, not that
I get to enjoy it.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.450
I spend most of my time
in places like this.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.285
How'd you find me?

33:06.318 --> 33:07.486
Inverse geometry.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.421
Ben Blakely.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.557
He's one of the best
in the business.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.592
Not as good as me...

33:13.625 --> 33:16.028
Really? 'Cause he knew
that you were watching him.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.296
He intercepted your video feeds.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.530
Oh, that briefcase.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.432
Ah, he was Warspying me.

33:20.466 --> 33:23.069
Cheap bastards wouldn't spring
for the double-encrypted feeds.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.204
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Cheap bastards being?

33:25.237 --> 33:27.073
The Elcar campaign.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.641
The guy running for governor?

33:29.675 --> 33:32.311
Yeah, Elcar got hit with three
scandals in two weeks.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.512
Figured they were being bugged,

33:33.545 --> 33:35.147
so they hired me
to sweep the offices.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.416
I backtraced
the bugs to Blakely.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.119
Started taping him
to see if we could get a lead

33:40.152 --> 33:41.487
on who hired him.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.722
I can't believe he was onto me.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.491
Damn, he played that cool.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.369
DON: We're back to where we
started.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.307
"However beautiful the strategy,

34:01.340 --> 34:02.641
you should occasionally
look at the results."

34:02.674 --> 34:06.578
Winston Churchill.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.148
That's pretty much
what King said.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.150
- You got yourself another fan.
- Yeah.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.384
I tend to get more respect

34:12.418 --> 34:13.485
from people who didn't give me

34:13.519 --> 34:15.487
noogies when I was six.

34:15.521 --> 34:18.524
Listen, Blakely is the man
in the Chinese Room.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.359
He processes information

34:20.392 --> 34:21.827
without ever understanding
its significance.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.430
- Okay, so?
- So that's the way he likes it.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.832
You know, it keeps his world
contained; that's his rulebook.

34:26.865 --> 34:30.269
Right. Him, David,
no cameras.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.639
There is an impartial
two-player

34:33.672 --> 34:36.542
perfect information game
called Chomp

34:36.575 --> 34:40.479
in which two players take turns
removing cookies.

34:40.512 --> 34:41.747
The object being

34:41.780 --> 34:43.682
to avoid taking

34:43.715 --> 34:45.351
the lower left corner,

34:45.384 --> 34:47.519
which is the poison cookie.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.555
You can mathematically
prove that using

34:49.588 --> 34:52.691
optimal moves, the first
player will always win,

34:52.724 --> 34:54.493
but you can't
mathematically determine

34:54.526 --> 34:57.396
first moves that will
guarantee a win.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.631
David made the first move
getting in the elevator?

34:59.665 --> 35:00.866
You became the third player

35:00.899 --> 35:02.468
when you screwed up
the winning strategy.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.503
Chaos theory holds

35:04.536 --> 35:08.340
that outcome is sensitive
to initial conditions.

35:08.374 --> 35:09.541
So you've got to restore

35:09.575 --> 35:12.844
the decision-making process
to David because he started it.

35:14.680 --> 35:15.847
Don, if you were
in that elevator,

35:15.881 --> 35:19.185
who would you want to make
the next move?

35:21.387 --> 35:23.722
So when you told us you were
retiring, you failed to mention

35:23.755 --> 35:26.358
that you had your
next job lined up.

35:26.392 --> 35:27.526
Governor's reelection campaign.

35:27.559 --> 35:29.561
Official title:
Intelligence Chief.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.830
Unofficially, you're the
dirty tricks guy.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.665
Without telling them
you moved Blakely

35:33.699 --> 35:36.535
from RICO surveillance
to spying on the governor's

35:36.568 --> 35:37.869
political rivals.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.906
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.408
We're talking
about misappropriation

35:42.441 --> 35:43.375
of government funds.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.647
You're not just going
to lose your job,

35:48.680 --> 35:50.782
you could end up bunking
with some of the people

35:50.816 --> 35:52.284
you've been busting.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.821
I had a whole story worked out.

35:55.854 --> 35:58.424
Why he was watching
a campaign building

35:58.457 --> 36:00.259
while he was
on a RICO case.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.428
And you know he never asked?

36:02.461 --> 36:03.862
Huh.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.665
The man as oblivious.

36:06.698 --> 36:07.833
Not so oblivious
he didn't figure out

36:07.866 --> 36:10.569
he was being followed.

36:10.602 --> 36:11.837
So you destroyed

36:11.870 --> 36:13.772
his career to protect your own.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.246
What's going on
over there, buddy?

36:20.279 --> 36:22.180
Talk to me.

36:26.618 --> 36:29.955
There's no way out
of this for me.

36:29.988 --> 36:34.260
The longer I sit here,
not knowing what I want...

36:34.293 --> 36:36.662
Not knowing what comes next...

36:39.765 --> 36:43.369
I'm just giving them more time
to try something else,

36:43.402 --> 36:45.304
something after that.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.209
Best bet, they kill me.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.480
What do you mean "best bet"?

36:54.513 --> 36:56.515
Believe it or not,

36:56.548 --> 37:00.018
this is the longest conversation
I've had with...

37:00.051 --> 37:01.987
anyone in...

37:04.656 --> 37:07.926
Since my wife...

37:07.959 --> 37:09.227
Since my son.

37:12.664 --> 37:15.601
So what am I holding on to here?

37:18.003 --> 37:19.638
You're getting ahead
of yourself.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.607
Ben, slow down.
No.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.242
No, it's clear now.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.419
Pick it up.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.690
- I'm not going to do that...
- Pick it up and shoot me.

37:41.627 --> 37:44.396
We've been through
too much, okay?

37:44.430 --> 37:46.632
I'm walking you
out of here today.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.500
Just do it for me, damn it!

37:49.601 --> 37:50.802
Or I swear to God,

37:50.836 --> 37:53.505
I will kill you where you sit!

37:59.044 --> 38:00.679
DON (over intercom):
Ben, Don Eppes.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.514
You were right.

38:02.548 --> 38:03.815
Devane was following you.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.951
We got proof and a confession.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.323
Look, Ben, I don't know

38:11.357 --> 38:12.591
what else to give you here.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.959
I mean, I can't lie to you

38:13.992 --> 38:15.894
and tell you everything's
going to be okay.

38:17.763 --> 38:20.899
But I can tell you we do believe
you, and I guarantee

38:20.932 --> 38:22.834
that Devane's going to pay.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.544
David, look, it's all yours.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.613
Negotiation is in your hands.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.585
Okay.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.520
Hey.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.326
(grunts)

39:09.781 --> 39:11.016
We're on our way down, Don.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.984
Let's go.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.856
You do it,

39:17.889 --> 39:18.890
and I'll k...

39:18.924 --> 39:20.125
You're going to kill me?

39:21.860 --> 39:24.763
If you really want to die, Ben,

39:24.796 --> 39:26.565
that's your best bet.

39:29.435 --> 39:32.771
If these elevator doors open,

39:32.804 --> 39:34.873
and I'm on the floor...

39:38.644 --> 39:40.712
SWAT will fill you
full of holes.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.052
Thing is, I don't think
you're a killer.

39:49.821 --> 39:52.924
You've had too many
chances today.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.427
Even with Devane.

39:55.461 --> 39:58.464
You could've got closer.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.065
You could've fired more shots.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.738
End of the day,
I think you're just tired.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.142
You're tired of
looking at pictures

40:11.176 --> 40:14.646
and listening words that
don't mean anything to you.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.582
You're tired of being alone.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.820
And you're scared.

40:21.853 --> 40:22.954
You're scared
of the alternative.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.460
You're sure about that?

40:31.029 --> 40:33.532
I'm betting my life on it.

40:56.888 --> 40:57.789
(bell dings)

40:59.157 --> 41:00.926
It's okay! It's okay!

41:20.178 --> 41:22.948
(handcuffs tightening)

41:38.930 --> 41:41.900
So now what?

41:41.933 --> 41:44.169
I ask myself the same
question every morning.

41:52.043 --> 41:55.681
Hell of a last day.

41:55.714 --> 41:56.848
What do you mean "last day"?

41:56.882 --> 42:00.085
I thought you said Narcotics
was just for a few weeks.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.053
You know what I mean.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.224
Look, maybe I'm wrong.

42:06.257 --> 42:08.259
Maybe we should just
give it another shot, huh?

42:08.293 --> 42:09.861
Because of what we got,

42:09.895 --> 42:11.597
or because you don't want
to feel like you bolted

42:11.630 --> 42:12.698
from another relationship?

42:15.133 --> 42:17.636
Come on, Don,
you stuck with us.

42:17.669 --> 42:20.672
Even after it was obvious
it wasn't going to work.

42:24.142 --> 42:26.277
Accepting the obvious
isn't running away.

42:26.311 --> 42:28.980
And for what it's worth, I don't
think you're that guy anymore.

42:29.014 --> 42:32.250
So when the right
thing comes along...

42:34.886 --> 42:36.788
...you're going
to stick with it.

42:41.292 --> 42:43.695
I wanted it to be us.

42:45.296 --> 42:47.232
See you around.

42:55.707 --> 42:56.975
This is a leap
of faith, isn't it?

42:57.008 --> 42:58.644
Getting back on this
elevator after they

42:58.677 --> 42:59.745
monkeyed with the
Overspeed Governor?

42:59.778 --> 43:02.147
Yeah, I can't believe that
publicity photographer.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.215
I told her I don't want her
printing those candids.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.251
Oh, you mean those of the
intrepid Charles Eppes

43:06.284 --> 43:07.719
working side by
side with the FBI

43:07.753 --> 43:09.287
in the middle of
a hostage crisis?

43:09.320 --> 43:10.622
No, why should she
want to use that?

43:10.656 --> 43:15.994
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:16.027 --> 43:17.395
- Hey.
- Oh.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.330
We came back up here

43:19.364 --> 43:21.332
'cause I thought I
might've left something.

43:21.366 --> 43:23.769
Well, I'm almost done,
so why don't you guys hang out

43:23.802 --> 43:25.003
and I'll buy the first round?

43:25.036 --> 43:26.938
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
