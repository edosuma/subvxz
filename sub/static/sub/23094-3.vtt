00:02.000 --> 00:05.320
You're having an affair, but even if you have done this

00:05.320 --> 00:08.039
I think I still really love you.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.520
I'm not.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.560
SHE SOBS

00:11.560 --> 00:14.640
This girl is a fling. You're not.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.120
She came into the surgery today and I did some tests.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.320
- You're saying I'm...? 
- Yes. You're pregnant.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.200
He's just had a hot summer and messed it up. He'll come back.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.160
When they make a decision on this child, you'll know.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.360
But two years,

00:31.360 --> 00:32.840
it says something.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.040
CRASHING For two years!

00:36.040 --> 00:37.840
A woman might get the house,

00:37.840 --> 00:42.120
the assets, the children, but that doesn't mean that she's won.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.200
- You said you did a lot of divorce work. 
- I do. Why?

00:45.200 --> 00:46.960
I'd like to book an appointment.

Hey!

00:59.720 --> 01:02.040
Morning!

01:02.040 --> 01:04.680
Early start for you.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.840
Hi.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.520
Looking good.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.320
Meeting.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.520
Right.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.920
- I've... 
- Yeah.

MUSIC PLAYS ON CAR STEREO

01:46.000 --> 01:47.840
No...

01:58.480 --> 02:00.960
I've got a motorcycle accident

02:00.960 --> 02:06.360
just beyond Junction 6 of the... A4220 out of Parminster.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.120
- MOTORCYCLIST GROANS 
- Is he going to die? 
- No.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.000
The rider's male, conscious,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.440
possible fractured arm.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.800
Can you try and stay still for me. HE MOANS

02:16.800 --> 02:19.800
I'm just lifting up your visor, OK?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.280
Er, no... I'm a doctor, I just happened to be passing.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.920
He's breathing, alert.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.560
Yes, yes, OK.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.960
Thank you.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.440
You seem fine, but I need you to stay absolutely still.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.560
Partly because of the risk of nerve damage,

02:33.560 --> 02:35.120
also I don't want blood on my shirt

02:35.120 --> 02:38.040
because I've got a really important meeting, is that all right?

02:38.040 --> 02:39.560
HE MURMURS

02:39.560 --> 02:41.000
Sorry?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.240

HE RETCHES

02:44.160 --> 02:45.840
HE COUGHS

02:48.560 --> 02:50.080
Hi.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.240
Jesus! What happened to you?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.640
Traffic.

02:58.080 --> 03:05.120
'This programme contains some strong language and some scenes of a sexual nature.'

03:55.600 --> 03:59.000
My thoughts keep running over the last two years.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.640
Birthdays, holidays.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.640
When we've had sex and I've told him that I love him.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.280
Walking around in the bedroom without any clothes on,

04:10.280 --> 04:12.080
thinking he likes what he sees...

04:14.480 --> 04:16.480
He was lying the whole time.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.760
- Sorry, you're a lawyer, you don't need to hear this. 
- It's fine.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.000
I asked you to bring in details of your finances...

04:29.000 --> 04:31.520
- There. 
- These are just your current account.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.840
Presumably, there are other savings, investments?

04:33.840 --> 04:36.320
- He handles the money, always has done. 
- Why?

04:36.320 --> 04:38.360
He said he was better at it.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.560
So, you don't know your financial situation at all?

04:42.520 --> 04:44.160
No, I suppose...

04:45.440 --> 04:48.240
This project, what's it called?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.800
- Academy Green. 
- And will it pay off?

04:52.320 --> 04:53.920
He says it's doing well.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.440
- He "says"... 
- Sorry.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.640
This is...

04:58.640 --> 05:01.400
No offence, but I'm not interested.

05:01.400 --> 05:05.320
This is really dull. This is not what my life is about. I just...

05:07.640 --> 05:11.040
- I just want to skip to the bit where I move on. 
- In a divorce,

05:11.040 --> 05:13.920
he'll officially take 50% of everything.

05:13.920 --> 05:18.120
- Your salary, your savings, your pension. 
- He cheated. Not me.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.560
Doesn't matter. 50% is the default.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.480
But if you're telling me he has complete control of your finances,

05:23.480 --> 05:25.800
he might already have hidden money away in preparation.

05:25.800 --> 05:29.160
Meaning...you could get even less. Are you happy with that?

05:29.160 --> 05:31.280
- No, of course not. 
- Look.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.680
By not telling him that you know,

05:33.680 --> 05:36.040
you've got an unusual advantage.

05:36.040 --> 05:39.680
You can look into this without him suspecting anything.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.320
So, what do I do?

05:41.320 --> 05:44.040
Depends what you want.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.280
I want my son to stay living in the town where he was born.

05:48.280 --> 05:52.240
I want to keep the life that I chose, the job that I love.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.440
My dignity.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.720
My money and my house.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.560
Good. Then, in the meantime,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.760
find out what he's planning.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.320
How much money he's got.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.000
And while you do that, play the dutiful wife

06:06.000 --> 06:07.720
so he doesn't suspect a thing.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.560
Morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.240
HE CLEARS THROAT

06:21.240 --> 06:23.360
Highbrook has a proud history.

06:23.360 --> 06:27.520
Generations of children have been educated here, including myself.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.520
Um, then, three years ago,

06:29.520 --> 06:31.560
the building was deemed unsuitable.

06:31.560 --> 06:35.000
The school relocated to a purpose-built facility,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.840
and now, I'm proud that the Academy Green development

06:38.840 --> 06:42.240
will give a new lease of life to this historic site.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.680
MAN: Quite right!

06:43.680 --> 06:46.320
20 luxury flats, right in the heart of town.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.280
APPLAUSE

06:48.280 --> 06:51.720
This isn't just a business opportunity for me,

06:51.720 --> 06:55.600
but a way of protecting the legacy of a building I love.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.960
So, I hope you'll all join me for a glass of champagne...

06:58.960 --> 07:01.080
Um, please take a brochure,

07:01.080 --> 07:04.480
and let's, um... Let's move forward! Let's build! Thank you.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.320
CHUCKLING AND APPLAUSE

07:07.320 --> 07:08.880
- Was that all right? 
- Yes.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.640
HUM OF CONVERSATION

07:12.640 --> 07:14.080
That'll be you one day, Tom.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.920
- Tom! 
- It took ages, that one...

07:15.920 --> 07:18.800
- Come and look at the model. Anna, Neil, come on. 
- Yeah.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.160
He's not bad at this, is he? Public speaking.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.000
He's worried about his suit.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.760
- Why? 
- He says he looks like he's selling cars.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.160
- Right, yes, I see what you mean! 
- THEY CHUCKLE

07:36.160 --> 07:41.440
Neil, I wanted to ask, could we find a moment to go over my accounts?

07:41.440 --> 07:43.880
I've always left it to Simon,

07:43.880 --> 07:47.280
but I've realised perhaps maybe I should pay more attention.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.920
- I thought you could talk me through it. 
- Sure.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.440
Over dinner maybe.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.600
Absolutely.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.600
And maybe don't mention it to Simon.

08:00.640 --> 08:04.040
- I wouldn't want him thinking that I don't trust him. 
- Of course.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.280
Well, just let me know when.

08:16.640 --> 08:20.840
Simon's right, this is historic.

08:20.840 --> 08:25.600
I gave Karl Lucas a hand job against that wall in 1993.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.200
And now, they're knocking it down!

08:29.200 --> 08:33.000
There was no internet or mobiles in the early '90s.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.440
So, in a town like this, nothing do except each other.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.640
Listen...

08:40.840 --> 08:44.480
Kate changed surgery. We got the paperwork through today.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.360
Makes sense.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.840
- Still need me tomorrow? 
- Yes.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.240
Never been undercover before. It's exciting.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.560
- Thanks. 
- OK.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.640
Mum? If you haven't seen the model, you should.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.040
- Impressed? 
- Mm, I suppose...

09:04.280 --> 09:06.400
- Proud of your dad? 
- A bit, yeah.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.840
- Thank you. 
- What for?

09:12.760 --> 09:14.480
Everything.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.240
It's my pleasure.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.160
Simon!

09:20.440 --> 09:23.480
Sorry, could you just cast your eye over this?

09:38.720 --> 09:40.920
GRAVEL CRUNCHES

09:40.920 --> 09:41.960
I can't do it.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.720
She's going to think I'm selling something, or mental.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.760
You've moved round the corner, just thought you'd say hello.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.680
People don't do that any more.

09:52.680 --> 09:56.480
They might if they're pregnant and want a sense of the community.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.200
Right, I'll just drop all that into the conversation(!)

10:00.200 --> 10:03.360
Say you're tired, put your hand on your tummy, and she'll work it out.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.720
Just...get her to like you.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.680
And then tomorrow, come back, get her talking about Simon,

10:09.680 --> 10:11.800
divorce, plans, anything.

10:11.800 --> 10:16.240
Worst that can happen, she shuts the door in your face.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.000
And if she does, I'll still give you the money.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.840
OK, OK.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.160
MESSAGE ALERT

10:44.960 --> 10:46.880

10:48.160 --> 10:53.400
Hi! Um, my name's Carly, I just moved in round the cor...

10:53.400 --> 10:56.160
Well... and I'm, um...

10:56.160 --> 10:59.120
- I am, too! 
- Are you? Congratulations!

10:59.120 --> 11:00.520
THEY LAUGH

11:00.520 --> 11:01.720
SHE SIGHS

11:01.720 --> 11:04.840
Well, I'm sorry. I'll leave you in peace. It's nice to meet you though.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.320
I will do. Hopefully, I'll see you around or something.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.960
- OK. Bye. 
- DOOR CLOSES

ENGINE STARTS

11:20.120 --> 11:22.040
How did you know?

11:22.040 --> 11:24.560
We moved here when I was pregnant.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.960
First thing I did? Made friends.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.280
At least, that's what I thought they were.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.960
We can stop the current medication,

11:36.960 --> 11:40.080
but in terms of a replacement, it's difficult.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.880
Your pain has proven very resistant to treatment.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.240
From a medical perspective, I would advise we go on as we are.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.280
But that's not to say there aren't any practical steps to make you

11:51.280 --> 11:54.200
more comfortable that you could discuss with the staff here.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.520
- We're having those conversations. 
- Good. Good.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.800
All right.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.360
Thank you for coming.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.600
Thank you.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.920
That's it, then. We just give up.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.360
Mum, no...

12:16.800 --> 12:20.480
If you have a pain in your head like a drill,

12:20.480 --> 12:23.120
all day, and all night,

12:23.120 --> 12:27.080
- how long do you wait? 
- Wait? What do you mean?

12:28.760 --> 12:30.160
Mum, it'll be OK.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.480
It went well today?

12:38.560 --> 12:40.240
Yeah. Really well.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.600
Mm. Proud.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.800
You better get going.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.480
Call us if you need anything.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.320
Love you, Mum.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.400
You understand, don't you?

12:58.400 --> 13:01.920
- Yes. 
- I can't do this forever.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.760
I just can't.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.880
I...

13:06.880 --> 13:08.520
(I can't have this conversation.)

13:10.720 --> 13:12.920
We're not giving up. I promise.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.320
I'll look into options.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.600
See you very soon.

13:32.760 --> 13:35.280
# My baby went away

13:35.280 --> 13:42.240
# He went away across the sea

13:42.240 --> 13:46.720
# It's been two years or so

13:46.720 --> 13:50.320
# Since I saw my baby go

13:50.320 --> 13:54.000
# And then this letter came for me... #

13:54.000 --> 13:56.760
SHE SIGHS

14:05.160 --> 14:06.480
You don't look normal.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.720
You could just say I look nice.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.800
Well, yeah, that's what I mean. It's unusual.

14:14.680 --> 14:17.680
- Thanks, Tom. 
- Long day. Taxi's outside.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.920
- Right. 
- Where are you going again?

14:19.920 --> 14:22.080
Local Medical Committee dinner.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.680
Sounds boring.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.960
Right. OK. And that's a...

14:25.960 --> 14:27.400
What?

14:27.400 --> 14:30.160
- And you wear heels for that, do you? 
- I'm a woman on a night out,

14:30.160 --> 14:33.280
so it's heels or flats, and flats don't go, so...

14:33.280 --> 14:36.520
- What do you want me to wear, trainers? 
- No...just...

14:36.520 --> 14:38.960
- You look really... 
- What?

14:40.120 --> 14:43.560
- It doesn't matter. 
- No, don't stop there. I'm on the way out the house.

14:43.560 --> 14:46.560
- I look really what? 
- I'm knackered. Have we got any crisps?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.680
I've had a tough day, too.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.600
- What time are you home? 
- Late.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.400
I might've gone to bed. Does Tom know what he's having for dinner?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.320
- Yes. 
- And is there anything for...

14:55.320 --> 14:58.240
Leftovers in the fridge. Crisps are in the bottom left cupboard.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.560
- Tom can show you if you get stuck. 
- Right...

15:22.640 --> 15:24.520
SCRAPING

15:41.480 --> 15:43.480
SHE KNOCKS

15:45.320 --> 15:46.520
Hi!

15:46.520 --> 15:47.760
Hi.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.840
I know this is weird, but I...

15:49.840 --> 15:52.080
I ordered a copy of this book,

15:52.080 --> 15:55.520
but I must've ordered it twice cos I got two copies through.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.640
And I thought, well, you're just down the road, you might want it.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.360
- Is Gemma about? 
- She's at a dinner. 
- Oh.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.680
- SHE SNORTS 
- Annoying.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.520
- You all right? 
- Yeah.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.880
- Told her yet? 
- No.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.640
Who's Kate changed doctors to?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.760
We shouldn't talk about all this now.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.080
- Is Tom...? 
- Upstairs.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.840
- Well, are you sure you don't want to send it back? 
- Nah.

16:20.840 --> 16:24.040
- It's...hassle. 
- Well, I can give you the money for it.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.600
No. Go on.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.400
- Thanks. ROS: 
- 'I have come...'

16:29.400 --> 16:32.280
all the way over. It turns out, for no good reason,

16:32.280 --> 16:35.480
and I know you're going through a lot, but the normal thing,

16:35.480 --> 16:38.800
and the polite thing would be to ask me in for cup of tea.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.720
Well, do you want to come in?

16:42.640 --> 16:44.960
Er, cup of tea?

16:44.960 --> 16:46.640
Or a gin and tonic?

16:57.480 --> 16:58.840
Sure.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.480
Drink?

17:31.040 --> 17:32.920
HE CLEARS THROAT

17:32.920 --> 17:34.760
DRINK POURS

17:37.560 --> 17:39.640
Can I be honest with you?

17:39.640 --> 17:42.480
I keep forgetting I'm pregnant.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.760
- You forget? 
- Yeah, yeah...

17:45.760 --> 17:47.600
It wasn't planned. So, yeah...

17:48.800 --> 17:50.960
So, how's the dad?

17:50.960 --> 17:52.680
Sorry, are you...?

17:52.680 --> 17:55.600
- Are you with the dad? 
- No, erm...

17:55.600 --> 17:58.120
He was drinking eight pints a night

17:58.120 --> 18:01.480
and grabbing me when I got home, so, I had enough.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.840
Got rid of him.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.680
Good.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.640
Well, better without.

18:08.640 --> 18:09.960
You?

18:09.960 --> 18:11.320
Yeah, we're together.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.440
Yeah...

18:13.440 --> 18:15.080
He doesn't live here though, does he?

18:15.080 --> 18:17.000
You can tell, it's spotless.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.680
Yeah, well...

18:19.880 --> 18:21.520
Long story.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.800
Go on.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.920
'People say that the perfect story is that you meet this one person

18:30.920 --> 18:33.320
'and fall completely in love, and then from that moment,'

18:33.320 --> 18:35.040
you don't need anything else.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.360
Despite the fact that the world keeps changing.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.200
People change, as well.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.920
Your work, your house and everything alters,

18:49.920 --> 18:53.000
you're expected to stick with just this one person.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.960
And despite that sounding unlikely, when I met Gemma I thought I could.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.240
I thought, "Actually, yes."

19:03.280 --> 19:05.120
"I'll never need anyone else."

19:12.800 --> 19:13.920
What I didn't realise...

19:16.080 --> 19:18.320
..is that it's possible to feel that

19:18.320 --> 19:20.880
about two different people at the same time.

19:22.640 --> 19:27.000
- You're still in love with Ge... 
- With Gemma. Yeah, of course. Yes!

19:31.280 --> 19:32.600
And Kate.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.440
- Both of them. 
- HE CHUCKLES

19:43.160 --> 19:45.080
The moment I tell Gemma, I lose her.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.560
And I lose my son.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.200
Weekends, evenings...

19:51.560 --> 19:54.160
..and he'll know the truth and he'll hate me.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.560
And that's the only reason you haven't told her?

20:04.200 --> 20:07.320
- She asked you to come tonight, didn't she? 
- No! 
- She suspects.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.160
All right, yes.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.800
Well, she...she doesn't think that you're with someone else.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.800
She's worried that you may be hiding

20:22.800 --> 20:24.680
something with the business, the money.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.200
She thought you might open up.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.800
Why would she think anything's wrong with the money?

20:32.600 --> 20:34.960
She may've noticed how stressed you look.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.480
- I don't look stressed! 
- Stressed is an understatement.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.840
Actually, you're right, you don't look stressed. You look ill.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.800
Is there something wrong with the money?

20:48.800 --> 20:51.520
Well, if there was, I wouldn't tell you now, would I?

20:51.520 --> 20:55.320
- You'd just go straight back to Gemma. 
- I'm not on her side.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.600
I'm stuck in the middle!

20:57.600 --> 20:59.920
I just want what's best!

20:59.920 --> 21:02.720
- Tell me the truth. 
- The truth about the money...

21:02.720 --> 21:04.480
CLATTERING

21:05.600 --> 21:07.880
..is that everything's about this far from fucked.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.680
'Financial matters?'

21:14.680 --> 21:18.200
Yeah. As our accountant, I hoped you could talk me through things.

21:18.200 --> 21:21.240
- Over dinner. 
- Yeah.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.720
What, earnings, tax, that sort of thing?

21:23.720 --> 21:27.040
- That sort of thing exactly. 
- Right...

21:27.040 --> 21:30.720
- Well, I'm afraid I didn't bring any files with me. 
- That's a shame.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.920
- I forgot. 
- I always had you down as organised. 
- Me, too!

21:37.440 --> 21:39.120
We'll just have to enjoy the food.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.480
The way Simon describes you when you first met -

21:44.480 --> 21:46.320
very different to now.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.120
How does he describe me?

21:49.160 --> 21:50.960
He makes you sound like an animal.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.400
Really?

21:52.400 --> 21:54.080
Feral.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.480
SHE LAUGHS

21:57.280 --> 21:59.320
You don't see that?

22:03.880 --> 22:06.000
How is Simon?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.680
You see him more than I do some weeks.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.760
Tell me how he's getting on at work.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.240
Hmm...

22:13.920 --> 22:16.960
Simon's ambitious, as you know.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.600
This project's a big step for him.

22:18.600 --> 22:22.360
- Will it make money? 
- I expect so. 
- So, it's going well?

22:22.360 --> 22:26.040
HE CLEARS THROAT He won't tell me. Thinks I'll worry.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.480
Right...

22:28.480 --> 22:31.040
As you know from our accounts, I've supported him

22:31.040 --> 22:33.480
over the last few years as he's started out.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.720
So, I'm keen it doesn't all go wrong now.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.360
You're spying.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.520
- What? 
- Like a doctor,

22:40.520 --> 22:43.560
- I can't disclose anything that happens with my clients... 
- I'm not.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.600
..even if the person asking...

22:45.600 --> 22:48.720
- is extremely persuasive. 
- I'm just making conversation.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.600
I don't want to talk about his work.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.400
I don't really want to talk about Simon,

22:54.400 --> 22:56.480
- so if that's why you're here... 
- I'm here because

22:56.480 --> 22:59.400
I think that life is passing me by and I'm missing out.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.680
I don't care what we talk about.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.480
BOTTLE CLINKS

23:05.480 --> 23:08.360
WINE POURS

23:12.480 --> 23:13.880
Let me give you a test.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.960
I'm going to tell you why I'm here, and if it offends you,

23:17.960 --> 23:21.120
you can get up, go home. We never have to speak of it again.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.560
But if it doesn't...

23:23.560 --> 23:25.720
you can stay sat right there.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.000
Go on, then.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.520
Why are you here, Neil?

23:30.520 --> 23:33.280
Because in the last five years I've thought a lot about your body

23:33.280 --> 23:35.800
and it's got to the point that I desperately want to know

23:35.800 --> 23:37.680
what's going on underneath that dress.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.520
Basically, Gemma...

23:41.600 --> 23:45.040
..I'm here because I think we'd have a really good time fucking.

23:45.040 --> 23:48.400
- FOOTSTEPS APPROACH 
- Are you ready for the main course?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.400
Yes, I think we are.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.760
- CARLY: 
- 'You've met her?'

24:00.760 --> 24:03.560
'Couple of times. She's arrogant.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.520
'Looks down at people.'

24:05.520 --> 24:09.600
- Sorry, I sound like a bitch but... 
- Is that why he wanted someone else?

24:09.600 --> 24:11.080
What?

24:11.080 --> 24:12.880
That she's arrogant.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.400
- Well, he didn't. 
- No, I mean... 
- No, he didn't want "someone else".

24:16.400 --> 24:18.440
It was about us, we got on.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.480
He wasn't looking to cheat.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.680
Actually, that was always the problem.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.440
I said to him, you need to tell her straightaway,

24:25.440 --> 24:27.080
or it's over and that was...

24:28.040 --> 24:30.400
KATE SIGHS That was two years ago.

24:32.280 --> 24:35.240
- And now, you've got a baby. 
- Yeah.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.960
Yeah, I was going to get rid of it.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.200
- Sorry, you...you probably don't want hear that. 
- It's fine.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.880
I wasn't ready,

24:46.880 --> 24:49.600
but he knows I want kids eventually, so...

24:52.280 --> 24:54.200
So he said, "Why not?"

24:56.080 --> 24:59.160
Promised me that if I kept the baby, he'd tell her straightaway.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.720
But nearly two weeks later...

25:04.600 --> 25:07.120
He'd said we'd get a proper house together,

25:07.120 --> 25:09.680
that he'd move her out to London with their son.

25:09.680 --> 25:13.560
- Has he got a divorce lawyer, all of that? 
- I doubt it.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.800
He's showing no signs of breaking up with her at all.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.800
'I've thought recently maybe I should...

25:23.800 --> 25:25.080
'Should..?

25:26.080 --> 25:28.080
'What, leave him?

25:28.080 --> 25:30.320
'Well, how did you feel when you split up with yours?

25:31.400 --> 25:32.600
'Terrible...'

25:34.000 --> 25:35.040
Right...

25:36.040 --> 25:38.560
..for two days. And then, I felt better.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.320
So, you didn't regret it?

25:41.320 --> 25:43.520
Not at all.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.400
- ROS: 
- 'The only way out is to tell her the truth

25:49.400 --> 25:51.080
'and deal with what happens.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.480
- SIMON: 
- 'No...'

25:55.520 --> 25:57.160
I can do it.

25:57.160 --> 26:00.720
The money's there, it'll all be fine once we start selling the flats.

26:00.720 --> 26:04.440
It's close but I need time...

26:05.800 --> 26:08.280
- Six months maybe. 
- You want to keep all of this going

26:08.280 --> 26:10.760
- for another six months?! 
- I have to.

26:13.720 --> 26:15.440
What about the baby?

26:15.440 --> 26:17.000
Yeah, well...

26:19.600 --> 26:20.920
DOOR OPENS

26:20.920 --> 26:22.160
Oh...

26:22.160 --> 26:23.840
- Hi, Ros. 
- Hiya.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.480
When's Mum home?

26:27.480 --> 26:30.840
- She might be late. You OK? 
- Yeah, I'm fine.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.480
- Sure? 
- Yeah. I was going to ask her something,

26:33.480 --> 26:35.280
- but it doesn't matter. 
- OK.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.000
Yeah, bye.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.600
Night, mate.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.320
I'll come and see you in a minute.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.040
- TEARFULLY: 
- Please don't tell her anything's wrong.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.240
Say the money's good.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.280
It'll all work out best for everyone in the end. I promise.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.960
GEMMA: 'Go on, you've got something to say.'

26:56.960 --> 26:58.840
Ah, booked a room.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.640
Upstairs, they have good rooms.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.640
And I booked one. So, there it is.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.080
- Now you know. 
- I already knew.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.880
- Oh? 
- When I went to the bathroom, I checked with reception.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.720
- You went to the bathroom when you first arrived. 
- That's right.

27:16.920 --> 27:19.080
So, you've known my intentions all evening.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.880
Neil, I've known your intentions for five years.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.680
HE LAUGHS

27:25.680 --> 27:28.200
Oh, God!

27:28.200 --> 27:30.000
Argh, you make me sound desperate!

27:31.200 --> 27:32.600
It would only be desperate

27:32.600 --> 27:35.040
if you were trapped in this marriage with Anna,

27:35.040 --> 27:37.600
and completely in love with the woman across the street.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.320
But...

27:39.320 --> 27:41.600
I don't think that's the case, is it?

27:43.480 --> 27:45.480
I'm not unique, am I?

27:47.440 --> 27:48.960
I'm not the first "other woman".

27:50.520 --> 27:52.840
There have been other women, yes.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.440
What are you into?

27:57.440 --> 27:59.960
- What you mean, um... 
- Why do you do it, these women?

28:01.440 --> 28:03.440
Honestly?

28:03.440 --> 28:05.480
- Pleasure. 
- Right. So...

28:07.080 --> 28:08.560
Let me be specific.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.080
What are you into?

28:15.360 --> 28:17.320
Don't ask questions like that lightly,

28:17.320 --> 28:19.680
- cos they have an effect coming from you. 
- I know.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.320
- Nothing weird. 
- Shame.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.560
SHE GIGGLES

28:29.400 --> 28:31.000
THEY LAUGH

28:32.280 --> 28:35.280
- Physical. 
- Sort of has to be physical.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.440
Look, Anna's great. I love her.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.040
But she's into it being...

28:44.120 --> 28:46.000
..loving, calm, gentle.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.880
So...sometimes I like to...

28:50.360 --> 28:53.040
- ..go for it. Right... 
- SHE LAUGHS

28:54.600 --> 28:58.040
- I'm better at doing than describing. 
- Oh, God!

28:59.600 --> 29:01.400
I don't fucking know!

29:03.840 --> 29:05.680
I...I improvise.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.000
What about you?

29:22.360 --> 29:25.520
I think we start by taking off our clothes.

29:30.440 --> 29:31.920
I'm married.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.560
I made a promise.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.280
I'll let you into a secret.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.800
There are only two types of married men.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.760
Those you know who cheat on their wives, and...

29:49.760 --> 29:51.680
those who are better at hiding it.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.920
Every man I've met who's in a long-term relationship,

29:55.920 --> 29:59.600
they've all been unfaithful at one point or another.

29:59.600 --> 30:03.040
- Really? 
- It's biological.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.400
Men like sex.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.920
They can hang around with one woman, but...

30:09.080 --> 30:14.320
..only if, now and then, they're allowed to fulfil their function.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.880
I don't feel guilty.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.400
What about women?

30:22.480 --> 30:25.360
Well, I think women probably like sex, too.

30:27.520 --> 30:28.960
The point is. It's...

30:30.440 --> 30:32.280
It's all very common.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.200
Up to you.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.320
SHE LAUGHS

33:13.960 --> 33:16.160
HE GROANS

33:16.160 --> 33:17.880
HE CLEARS THROAT

33:19.800 --> 33:21.320
Mmph!

33:21.320 --> 33:23.120
Got work.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.840
What, already?

33:34.400 --> 33:36.280
I have to go home first.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.000
I thought...

33:43.000 --> 33:44.600
we might have another go.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.320
When do we tell Anna?

33:47.320 --> 33:48.480
Yeah!

33:49.520 --> 33:52.000
Or Simon for that matter.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.960
Wait! What if we don't(!)

33:54.960 --> 33:56.280
I'm serious.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.000
She's my friend.

34:00.920 --> 34:04.720
- Well, you didn't think about Anna too much last night. 
- I know.

34:06.240 --> 34:08.320
She's going to be really upset...

34:10.159 --> 34:11.679
..but she'd be far more upset

34:11.679 --> 34:14.080
if she finds out that we tried to hide it from her.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.560
What, er... What are you doing?

34:19.400 --> 34:21.320
- I'm saying we should be honest. 
- No, no.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.080
No, you're not, you're playing a game

34:24.080 --> 34:27.679
and I don't get it, so it's making me quite nervous.

34:27.679 --> 34:29.560
I don't like deceit.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.400
I'm not going to tell Anna about this and neither are you.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.199
If you did, I could tell Simon.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.239
Go ahead.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.560
I'll tell him myself.

34:44.719 --> 34:46.239
What do you want?

34:48.719 --> 34:49.840
Ah...

34:51.400 --> 34:54.320
Was last night...to blackmail me?

34:55.639 --> 34:57.880
In reverse order - no.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.680
Last night was...

35:03.920 --> 35:06.520
..because I fancy you and I wanted to have a good night.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.360
I enjoyed the sex, the company.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.800
Last night was fantastic, everything I'd hoped for.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.840
But this morning, what do I want?

35:22.680 --> 35:26.040
Well, if you're asking me to lie...

35:27.440 --> 35:29.800
..I want something to make up for it.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.760
- Like what? 
- Simon's accounts. His personal and business.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.480
Copies of everything stretching back the last three years, every detail,

35:39.480 --> 35:41.880
not just the official stuff.

35:41.880 --> 35:45.080
I'm going to have them looked at so don't try and hide anything.

35:45.080 --> 35:48.720
- Gemma, that's a lot of work. 
- I want them this afternoon...

35:50.880 --> 35:53.040
It's not possible to get all that stuff together.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.440
How long have you been married?

35:56.240 --> 35:57.840
15 years?

35:57.840 --> 36:01.000
I've seen you and Anna together a lot.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.920
You look after her, you take her on holiday,

36:04.920 --> 36:07.400
I mean, you genuinely love her, don't you?

36:07.400 --> 36:09.160
She's what really matters.

36:10.480 --> 36:11.640
Yes.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.400
What we just did, it's...

36:13.400 --> 36:14.920
just a bonus.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.160
Um, why...

36:22.200 --> 36:23.840
Why do you want his accounts?

36:23.840 --> 36:27.040
Because I think there are things going on in our finances

36:27.040 --> 36:28.440
that I don't know about.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.120
Am I right?

36:34.880 --> 36:37.240
- Now I see it. 
- See what?

36:38.640 --> 36:40.040
Feral.

36:43.720 --> 36:46.120
This afternoon. Your office, or at home?

36:50.280 --> 36:51.640
Home.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.160
Anna's out.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.880
Honestly...

37:04.240 --> 37:05.680
..it was really good.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.440
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

38:19.840 --> 38:21.240
Mum...

38:23.200 --> 38:25.880
SHE MURMURS

38:25.880 --> 38:27.240
Late night?

38:29.720 --> 38:31.320
You don't look well.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.800
I'm fine. I just need a shower.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.320
- What's the time? 
- Eight o'clock.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.280
Oh...

38:40.280 --> 38:42.680
- You have a good time? 
- Yeah.

38:44.480 --> 38:45.680
What?

38:48.080 --> 38:50.840
Last night, Tom was looking at CheckMyGP,

38:50.840 --> 38:54.480
- it's a ratings site for... 
- What are you looking at that for?

38:54.480 --> 38:57.680
- Harry told me about it. 
- Because normally they say good things,

38:57.680 --> 38:59.200
- and he's proud of you. 
- Right.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.640
Right.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.440
So, what do you mean, "normally"?

39:04.440 --> 39:07.080
They...they started last night.

39:15.160 --> 39:18.920
TOM SIGHS

39:18.920 --> 39:20.440
Have you read all of these?

39:20.440 --> 39:22.560
Most of them.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.960
They're not true.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.400
We'll get them taken down, won't we?

39:26.400 --> 39:30.800
- Sometimes people write things like this on the internet. 
- Why?

39:30.800 --> 39:35.040
- Someone wants to get at Mum. 
- Don't worry, Tom. 
- Who?

39:36.400 --> 39:37.760
We don't know.

39:39.080 --> 39:40.560
I'll deal with this.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.600
I should have a shower.

39:56.840 --> 39:59.760
Luke, finally... You've just seen Helen?

39:59.760 --> 40:01.040
Yes.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.320
And I agree with the specialist.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.800
There's not much to be done in terms of medication.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.240
So, we talked through changes to the home, management,

40:13.240 --> 40:14.560
coping strategies.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.880
- I don't know that that's enough. 
- Yeah.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.360
And she asked me to tell you that she wanted to see you.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.200
Today, if possible.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.600
OK, thanks.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.080
Busy morning!

40:32.640 --> 40:34.160
I give up!

40:37.560 --> 40:39.600
Ros.

40:39.600 --> 40:45.760
Sorry, can I just say that I'm not really comfortable with...flirting.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.000
Not at work.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.400
OK...

40:49.400 --> 40:50.800
Is that all right?

40:50.800 --> 40:52.560
- Yeah, fine. 
- Thanks.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.760
I've gone off him.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.520
Last night...

41:03.680 --> 41:08.680
- The bad news is, I had to tell him you'd sent me. 
- Why?

41:08.680 --> 41:11.680
Because he guessed, so I said all right, yes,

41:11.680 --> 41:13.200
you asked me to come round,

41:13.200 --> 41:17.480
- but it was only cos you were worried about the money. 
- OK, and?

41:17.480 --> 41:20.400
He said there's enough to keep the project going

41:20.400 --> 41:23.000
and in time it'll...

41:23.000 --> 41:26.200
- it'll be OK. 
- So, no problems then?

41:28.080 --> 41:31.680
- He seemed sure that it would all work out. 
- But if that's true,

41:31.680 --> 41:35.000
now that she's pregnant, why doesn't he just come out and tell me?

41:35.000 --> 41:36.520
I mean what's he waiting for?

41:36.520 --> 41:39.640
I'm told Kate has exactly the same question.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.200
How do you know?

41:43.600 --> 41:46.600
I know it's weird, but from what he said last night...

41:46.600 --> 41:50.000
he still loves you. Maybe that's the reason.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.200
And it's good to be loved, Gemma.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.520
It really is.

41:58.440 --> 42:01.160
'So, as you can see, he's raided everything.'

42:01.160 --> 42:03.480
My friend said he had it under control.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.720
Well, your friend was wrong. Look...

42:05.720 --> 42:09.800
ISA, savings, Tom's fund for university.

42:09.800 --> 42:13.040
That money came from my parents.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.480
When they died.

42:16.320 --> 42:20.120
- Er, remortgaged the house... 
- I'm sorry?

42:20.120 --> 42:23.120
Well, presumably you know about that. You, um...

42:23.120 --> 42:24.880
You signed it.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.280
No, I didn't.

42:32.120 --> 42:35.680
OK, well, look, I don't give advice,

42:35.680 --> 42:37.840
I JUST do the accounts.

42:37.840 --> 42:40.320
But you really shouldn't have just left it up to him.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.520
He can barely add up, let alone run a business.

42:44.360 --> 42:48.160
Anyway, as you can imagine, all that wasn't nearly enough.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.440
He got halfway into it, secured the building,

42:50.440 --> 42:52.680
but had no funds for the development itself.

42:52.680 --> 42:55.480
Then this new investor arrives.

42:55.480 --> 42:58.800
Um, "White Stone", starts ploughing in cash.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.840
So far, just over a million, in a number of instalments.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.080
That's how he's managed to start the work.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.760
- Who's "White Stone"? 
- No idea. They're registered offshore,

43:06.760 --> 43:09.880
so I can't find out and Simon won't tell me.

43:09.880 --> 43:11.360
If that money keeps coming in,

43:11.360 --> 43:14.360
then what you've heard from your friend is right,

43:14.360 --> 43:16.880
he might get to the end of the project, sell the flats,

43:16.880 --> 43:19.080
make it all back, and a lot more.

43:19.080 --> 43:23.160
But, um, if for any reason, it stops, then, um...

43:24.360 --> 43:26.240
Well, he'll be bankrupt within a week.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.840
My savings, mortgage...

43:30.000 --> 43:31.120
..everything.

43:31.120 --> 43:32.520
Gone.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.080
If Simon asks how you got this information...

43:45.080 --> 43:47.920
Yes, I'll make something up.

43:47.920 --> 43:51.440
And if you need any more information or advice...

43:52.800 --> 43:54.280
Well, we could meet again.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.720
SHE LAUGHS

43:56.720 --> 43:57.920
I'm sorry...?

43:59.160 --> 44:02.280
Neil, I'm blackmailing you.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.600
Yeah.

44:09.200 --> 44:12.400
The truth is I don't really like Simon.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.640
He's a mate, he's a client, but he's patronising.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.360
Thinks he knows it all. It's ANNOYING.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.280
I keep thinking about last night.

44:21.440 --> 44:24.200
We could meet again, if you want.

44:27.520 --> 44:28.760
White Stone?

44:30.080 --> 44:33.360
- Um, yeah. 
- Will you keep trying to find out who it is?

44:33.360 --> 44:34.640
DOOR OPENS

44:34.640 --> 44:36.800
Hello! Not a bad day out there now.

44:36.800 --> 44:40.120
Got bread and wipes for the kitchen, but there was some...

44:40.120 --> 44:43.480
- Hi, love. 
- Oh! Hi! 
- Hi. 
- I didn't know you were here.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.440
Neil was helping with my accounts.

44:45.440 --> 44:48.960
I think we've got everything sorted, so I should probably head off.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.360
Sorry, I'm in a hurry...

44:51.360 --> 44:54.720
OK, sure. Bye! We'll see you later.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.440
Hey.

44:58.440 --> 45:00.400
Are you all right?

45:01.400 --> 45:03.160
'He'll get nothing.'

45:03.160 --> 45:07.200
Once the divorce starts, it'll all come out,

45:07.200 --> 45:11.040
- him taking your money, forging your signature. 
- Yes.

45:12.320 --> 45:14.840
And the project will collapse probably.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.840
We'll lose it all.

45:16.840 --> 45:19.320
SHE SOBS But I earn enough.

45:19.320 --> 45:22.960
And what he's done only strengthens my case.

45:22.960 --> 45:25.160
Tom and me, we'll be OK.

45:25.160 --> 45:28.360
And I promise we'll always look after you.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.600
What about him?

45:31.240 --> 45:34.560
You probably don't care, I understand that. But...

45:36.000 --> 45:38.440
..you'll look after him?

45:38.440 --> 45:40.360
You won't leave him with nothing?

45:42.160 --> 45:43.760
It'll be fair.

45:46.120 --> 45:47.400
I promise.

45:48.480 --> 45:51.000
VOICEMAIL TONE

45:51.000 --> 45:54.320
Hi, Anwar, I think I've got everything. I want to proceed.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.640
Can you call me back?

46:03.760 --> 46:05.000
Hey. What's the matter?

46:06.760 --> 46:08.680
- Are you OK? 
- I did it.

46:10.600 --> 46:11.960
What? Your boyfriend?

46:11.960 --> 46:14.320
Oh, shit, he followed me.

46:16.600 --> 46:18.520
We can't do this in here.

46:18.520 --> 46:22.520
I told you, I'm only keeping it if you finish it with her.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.360
You said you would!

46:24.360 --> 46:25.800
I want to.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.640
It's not good enough, that.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.720
Anyway...

46:30.720 --> 46:32.440
It's gone now.

46:32.440 --> 46:34.080
It's better.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.640
- It's my body. It's up to me. 
- You know why I couldn't tell her.

46:38.640 --> 46:41.080
Either go and tell her now,

46:41.080 --> 46:42.360
or that is it.

46:43.640 --> 46:45.160
It was my child, too.

46:45.160 --> 46:47.280
Are you going to go and tell her?

46:49.640 --> 46:50.720
No.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.400
You're right, you shouldn't wait any more.

47:07.680 --> 47:09.680
DOOR CLOSES

47:11.040 --> 47:13.000
'He left. She waited.'

47:13.000 --> 47:14.160
He didn't come back.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.640
And do you think it's really over?

47:18.640 --> 47:21.440
She had it done without telling him.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.640
He looked like he'd never forget that.

47:25.960 --> 47:28.960
Maybe it doesn't matter, but in the end,

47:28.960 --> 47:30.720
he was the one that finished it.

47:30.720 --> 47:32.440
He told her not to wait.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.720
That doesn't change anything.

47:50.960 --> 47:53.800
TOM LAUGHS

48:03.760 --> 48:06.760
TOM GIGGLES

48:14.040 --> 48:15.880
LAUGHTER FROM TV

48:15.880 --> 48:19.280
SHE PIERCES LOUDLY

48:23.400 --> 48:25.800
Everything all right?

48:25.800 --> 48:27.560
Just about.

48:30.600 --> 48:33.400
- Hard at the moment, isn't it? 
- LAUGHTER FROM TV NEARBY

48:42.960 --> 48:45.120
We were watching a thing.

48:45.120 --> 48:47.000
It's...it's funny.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.360
I'll be over in a minute.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.960
PHONE RINGS

49:33.280 --> 49:34.440
Hello?

49:36.560 --> 49:37.920
Yes?

49:43.520 --> 49:45.800
Yeah, yeah. I'll be there as soon as I can.

50:03.360 --> 50:05.480
I'm so sorry.

50:05.480 --> 50:08.880
- Have the police spoken to you? 
- No. 
- They just said to wait.

50:10.240 --> 50:13.400
She took an overdose of sleeping pills.

50:15.080 --> 50:16.720
Left a short note.

50:16.720 --> 50:20.280
It says that the pain had got too much,

50:20.280 --> 50:22.840
and she couldn't carry on.

50:22.840 --> 50:25.680
- But, then, why didn't she tell us. 
- She did. 
- Yes, but...

50:25.680 --> 50:26.960
We knew she was suffering,

50:26.960 --> 50:29.520
there just wasn't anything that we could do to help.

50:39.520 --> 50:40.960
How did she get the pills?

50:42.120 --> 50:44.840
In the note, she talks about storing them up for a long time,

50:44.840 --> 50:47.600
pretending to take them and saving them.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.400
This sort of thing, it does happen.

50:54.800 --> 50:57.520
You never gave her..?

50:57.520 --> 50:58.920
I'm sorry?

50:58.920 --> 51:01.160
Something they asked me.

51:01.160 --> 51:03.160
- Whether you might. 
- I wouldn't.

51:08.360 --> 51:09.840
Oh, Simon.

51:29.720 --> 51:32.080
- What's happened? 
- Come and sit down.

51:39.920 --> 51:43.600
Mate, you know Granny was, um, very ill.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.840
She was hurting all the time.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.560
Yeah, yes.

51:46.560 --> 51:51.120
Well, I'm afraid, last night, she passed away.

51:51.120 --> 51:52.680
She died in her sleep.

51:58.120 --> 52:01.200
- She's...she's... 
- It was peaceful. She's not in pain any more.

52:02.560 --> 52:05.880
TOM SOBS

52:08.840 --> 52:11.600
- TEARFULLY: 
- It's really sad. I'm sorry.

52:21.400 --> 52:23.600
Oh, Tom...

52:33.680 --> 52:35.080
I thought it might help.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.600
Maybe you could give it a try?

52:39.720 --> 52:41.760
You think it's silly, hey?

52:47.760 --> 52:50.120
I'm just going to go and see your dad.

53:12.680 --> 53:16.880
When my mum and dad died, the woman who looked after me, Mary,

53:16.880 --> 53:19.440
she gave me a notebook to write down how I felt.

53:20.760 --> 53:21.800
Stupid.

53:26.840 --> 53:29.000
Not at all.

53:38.680 --> 53:40.840
PHONE BUZZES

53:40.840 --> 53:42.040
Sorry.

53:50.840 --> 53:53.240
Hi. Anwar. Yeah...

53:54.560 --> 53:55.880
No.

54:00.080 --> 54:01.920
I've changed my mind.

54:03.480 --> 54:04.960
We're all right.

54:06.560 --> 54:08.120
We're going to try again.

54:27.240 --> 54:29.360
HE SOBS LOUDLY

54:33.080 --> 54:36.440
HE CRIES

55:10.960 --> 55:12.840
"What's typhoid"?

55:12.840 --> 55:16.480
How can you simply take him back?

55:16.480 --> 55:20.280
Because we have a child together. A life together.

55:20.280 --> 55:21.800
14 years under our belt,

55:21.800 --> 55:24.360
so if there's any way of keeping all of that, I have to try.

55:24.360 --> 55:27.800
And you honestly think that he's never going to see her again?

55:30.480 --> 55:32.440
TEXT ALERT

55:34.480 --> 55:36.960
You think I'm lying? You still don't trust me?

55:37.305 --> 55:43.290
