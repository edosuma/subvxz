01:58.535 --> 01:59.743
He is
as old as mankind.

02:04.742 --> 02:06.533
Long before he came
into our cities

02:07.741 --> 02:11.115
he waited in dark
forests and deep rivers

02:11.200 --> 02:13.032
for the lost, the weak.

02:16.199 --> 02:20.074
Cursed by the Great Father, he
is as hateful as he is foul.

02:22.448 --> 02:25.698
He is the Tokoloshe,
one that feeds

02:25.780 --> 02:29.322
on children and
those left alone.

02:38.402 --> 02:39.695
No,
I agree with you.

02:39.777 --> 02:42.195
This influx of immigrants
into Johannesburg

02:42.277 --> 02:43.859
has been unprecedented.

02:43.944 --> 02:46.984
Neighborhoods like Hillbrow
changed virtually overnight.

02:47.069 --> 02:49.400
I mean, the issue is they're
still coming from all over.

02:49.483 --> 02:51.068
There's no more place for them.

02:51.150 --> 02:53.399
They're sleeping
rough, sardines packed

02:53.482 --> 02:56.942
into condemned buildings with
no water, no electricity.

02:57.024 --> 02:58.067
It's a health hazard.

03:36.184 --> 03:37.266
Busi Zondi,

03:40.641 --> 03:42.265
welcome to the night shift.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.433
Thank you for the opportunity.

03:45.515 --> 03:47.472
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
don't thank me.

03:48.682 --> 03:51.014
If it had been my choice
you wouldn't be here.

03:54.513 --> 03:55.681
Can I ask why, sir?

03:58.680 --> 04:00.512
You're
all just trouble.

04:02.180 --> 04:04.969
The last girl that was in
here left after two months.

04:06.137 --> 04:08.427
It's a constantly
revolving door.

04:10.386 --> 04:11.969
It makes my job difficult.

04:16.052 --> 04:17.885
No, not me, sir.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.757
I'm more than
committed to the work.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.882
Are you, now?

04:29.964 --> 04:31.256
Your shift starts at 9 p.m.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.549
You arrive late,
they'll deduct pay.

04:33.632 --> 04:35.881
If you leave early
they'll deduct pay.

04:36.881 --> 04:38.256
Make sure that you clock in.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.713
And wear your regulation
uniform otherwise...

04:44.797 --> 04:46.254
I must pay.

04:46.336 --> 04:47.171
Mm.

04:48.086 --> 04:48.921
Take it.

04:51.170 --> 04:52.003
Hello?

04:53.170 --> 04:54.960
It's very quiet
for a hospital.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.959
Budget cuts,
care is rent-free.

04:57.959 --> 04:58.794
What's that?

04:59.669 --> 05:00.752
Budget cuts.

05:35.577 --> 05:37.077
This is where it all comes.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.369
Do I have to use that?

05:38.451 --> 05:40.786
No, whatever you do,
don't ever go near that.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.160
Sometimes

05:46.535 --> 05:48.575
cats stay in there.

05:54.408 --> 05:55.573
Make sure it's not you.

05:59.323 --> 06:01.364
Get those bags and
give it to this beauty.

06:02.697 --> 06:03.782
Is she the new one?

06:04.615 --> 06:05.447
Mm-hmm.

06:06.614 --> 06:08.781
You need to get a
receipt for all those.

06:09.906 --> 06:11.030
Wouldn't want
this stuff ending up

06:11.113 --> 06:13.363
in a landfill where
kids can find it.

06:13.445 --> 06:14.362
Now, do we?

06:16.319 --> 06:17.861
What is it?

06:17.944 --> 06:19.029
Human waste.

06:20.194 --> 06:21.860
Can you tell me
about Mr. Ruatonim?

06:24.986 --> 06:26.985
Honey, if I can
give you some advice,

06:27.067 --> 06:30.402
keep your tits tucked
in and legs crossed

06:30.485 --> 06:31.859
and everything will be fine.

06:42.399 --> 06:43.899
Get in, it's wet.

06:45.064 --> 06:46.774
My stop's around
the corner, sir.

06:46.857 --> 06:49.398
I wanted to
apologize for earlier.

06:49.481 --> 06:51.064
It's been difficult
with the layoffs

06:51.148 --> 06:53.812
and people not coming to work.

06:57.230 --> 06:58.063
Um...

07:00.146 --> 07:02.979
Can I ask why the
other girl left, sir?

07:03.061 --> 07:06.602
Ah, she, um, she
said she couldn't

07:06.685 --> 07:09.144
handle the graveyard
shift anymore.

07:09.227 --> 07:11.394
It's challenging work.

07:11.477 --> 07:12.977
I'm not afraid
of hard work, sir.

07:13.059 --> 07:14.019
That's
good to know.

07:14.102 --> 07:15.684
Let me drive you home.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.476
We can have a
proper introduction.

07:19.268 --> 07:22.600
Um, honestly, sir, my
stop's around the corner.

07:22.682 --> 07:23.517
Okay.

07:27.806 --> 07:28.973
Suit yourself.

07:30.430 --> 07:31.265
Bitch.

08:50.666 --> 08:53.291
Look what I brought for you.

08:53.375 --> 08:54.457
It's a sheet.

08:57.165 --> 08:59.499
Don't shout at me because I did
not buy it.

09:04.664 --> 09:05.664
Do you like it?

09:09.788 --> 09:12.537
Soon I will have money to bring
you here!

09:12.871 --> 09:16.412
I promise you my sister we will
be together again.

10:05.611 --> 10:06.443
Lindi?

10:07.693 --> 10:09.736
Hello?

10:10.610 --> 10:11.567
Can you hear me?

10:12.026 --> 10:14.860
Lindi?

10:14.942 --> 10:16.191
Shit.

10:16.900 --> 10:17.900
My God.

10:46.895 --> 10:47.811
My God.

11:23.263 --> 11:24.097
Hello?

12:03.255 --> 12:04.089
Hello?

12:10.045 --> 12:12.045
Is there somebody there?

12:38.165 --> 12:38.998
Hey.

12:43.873 --> 12:46.872
You're not supposed
to be down here.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.768
What do you want here?

14:32.477 --> 14:33.936
You're not supposed to be here!

15:04.512 --> 15:06.470
What's going on?

15:06.555 --> 15:07.721
New here?

15:07.805 --> 15:09.761
I was following the
boy down the stairs.

15:09.845 --> 15:13.179
Oh, Thabang.

15:13.261 --> 15:15.093
He's always sneaking
off, but we're far

15:15.178 --> 15:16.928
too few to keep an
eye on them all.

15:18.094 --> 15:19.635
They are sick?

15:19.718 --> 15:23.093
Some are, but most are
AIDS orphans booked in

15:23.177 --> 15:25.092
for monitoring and
just forgotten.

15:27.801 --> 15:28.676
There we go.

15:28.758 --> 15:30.300
Okay, come, let's get into bed.

15:31.425 --> 15:33.466
You are
really good with them.

15:33.550 --> 15:34.757
You learn.

15:34.841 --> 15:36.090
Have any of your own?

15:39.506 --> 15:42.088
Every night it's something else.

15:43.255 --> 15:45.423
I'm Rosie, by the way.

15:45.505 --> 15:46.587
Busi.

15:46.672 --> 15:48.422
The new cleaner, right!

15:49.588 --> 15:51.712
Have you heard the old stories?

15:51.796 --> 15:54.587
About the Tokoloshe
that tricks children

15:54.671 --> 15:57.752
into trusting him
before drowning them?

15:57.836 --> 16:00.461
That's why the bricks
are here, but, um,

16:01.751 --> 16:04.751
let's just say he isn't small.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.918
They don't know what I mean.

16:10.709 --> 16:12.833
I really
must get back to work.

16:12.917 --> 16:13.833
Ruatonim.

16:15.292 --> 16:18.623
Geez, babe, if there ever was
a Tokoloshe, it's Ruatonim.

16:21.457 --> 16:23.123
I must
get back to work.

16:26.747 --> 16:28.414
It was
nice to meet you.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.030
Help!

17:20.030 --> 17:20.863
Help!

17:22.819 --> 17:23.654
Help!

17:29.653 --> 17:30.486
Help!

17:34.735 --> 17:35.568
Help!

17:38.816 --> 17:39.651
Help!

17:52.314 --> 17:54.148
What were you doing?

17:57.606 --> 17:59.647
There are rules and I'm here

17:59.730 --> 18:01.730
to make sure people follow them.

18:02.562 --> 18:03.437
I must get back...

18:03.522 --> 18:04.354
No.

18:06.229 --> 18:07.312
Yes, sir.

18:07.396 --> 18:10.310
Why the sudden rush?

18:10.395 --> 18:13.978
Do you have a
boyfriend, Busi Zondi?

18:14.060 --> 18:15.394
No!

18:15.477 --> 18:16.310
Please, sir, let me go!

18:16.394 --> 18:18.602
How much do you need this job?

18:19.684 --> 18:20.975
Let me hear it again!

18:22.058 --> 18:23.643
Let me go!

18:26.850 --> 18:27.933
Shut up!

18:28.017 --> 18:28.850
Shut up!

18:42.847 --> 18:43.930
Run!

18:45.679 --> 18:46.721
Run!

19:16.341 --> 19:17.424
Busi Zondi?

19:43.586 --> 19:45.835
Hiding isn't going to help.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.330
Thank you.

20:19.621 --> 20:21.411
Please give me a moment, sir.

20:21.496 --> 20:23.285
If you don't
have the correct fare,

20:23.370 --> 20:24.578
you don't ride.

20:24.660 --> 20:25.660
I'm sorry.

20:30.619 --> 20:31.994
Come on, come
on, you're holding up

20:32.077 --> 20:34.284
the rest of my
passengers, please.

20:41.325 --> 20:42.658
Take this money and pay the
driver.

20:44.949 --> 20:46.032
I can't accept it.

20:46.281 --> 20:49.116
Take this money If you don't
want me to hit you with this stick.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.114
Thank you.

21:07.737 --> 21:08.570
Thank you.

21:27.608 --> 21:28.941
It's going to be okay.

21:29.773 --> 21:30.773
What are you doing?

21:31.816 --> 21:32.857
I'm sorry my child...

21:32.940 --> 21:34.523
...If it seems like I'm
prying...

21:34.940 --> 21:37.107
...but my spirit senses that...

21:37.939 --> 21:39.647
...your soul is troubled.

21:47.855 --> 21:49.019
There is a way...

22:03.727 --> 22:05.059
I have to get off here.

22:07.351 --> 22:08.516
Are you coming with me?

22:12.933 --> 22:13.933
Why?

22:16.557 --> 22:18.515
My daughter once said to me...

22:21.973 --> 22:23.388
...If you want to be strong...

22:24.723 --> 22:26.055
...you have to wake up,

22:26.762 --> 22:27.762
...and do something.

22:31.054 --> 22:32.054
Are you coming?

22:33.971 --> 22:35.179
I'm sorry...

22:35.928 --> 22:37.136
...I don't even know you!

22:41.927 --> 22:42.802
Abel.

22:45.427 --> 22:46.968
My name is Abel.

22:51.676 --> 22:53.050
Have a nice day then.

23:18.296 --> 23:21.003
The police where here again...

23:21.377 --> 23:22.462
...threatening to evict
people...

23:22.545 --> 23:23.628
...all they wanted was a
bribe...

23:23.712 --> 23:24.794
...you know how they are.

23:24.876 --> 23:27.626
I'll get my boys and we'll deal
with them.

23:27.711 --> 23:28.669
Jesus.

23:30.085 --> 23:32.293
My boys don't have hearts you
know.

23:32.375 --> 23:34.916
This whole thing is just a mess.

23:34.999 --> 23:36.416
There you go, madame.

23:36.499 --> 23:37.334
Ta-da!

23:40.541 --> 23:41.833
So Busi tell me...

23:41.916 --> 23:43.208
...this place is too big...

23:43.623 --> 23:45.582
...It's way too big for you to
be alone.

23:45.665 --> 23:47.248
Sleeps at least 20.

23:49.122 --> 23:50.581
We come a long way, you and I...

23:50.664 --> 23:52.331
Not once did I
ask you for money.

23:53.456 --> 23:54.496
...I always knew you'd pay.

23:54.581 --> 23:56.495
But now, I need to ask peeps.

23:57.538 --> 23:58.413
Where is the money?

23:58.495 --> 23:59.537
The money is needed.

24:00.330 --> 24:02.619
But, I don't get that
money, they break my legs,

24:02.704 --> 24:03.912
Busi, they come for you.

24:04.662 --> 24:05.495
Come on Busi make a plan...

24:08.036 --> 24:09.453
...you know that you and me...

24:09.536 --> 24:10.744
...since way back I
knew you wanted me!

24:10.828 --> 24:11.661
I'll pay you, Jakes.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.367
But then Busi, when?

24:15.952 --> 24:17.616
Okay girl, next week.

24:19.451 --> 24:22.450
I never get my way with this
one.

25:08.232 --> 25:10.398
Tonight
we'll be talking about

25:10.481 --> 25:13.731
the shocking levels of
child abuse in South Africa.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.316
One in three children
is sexually abused.

25:15.399 --> 25:16.273
Feels good my child?

25:16.315 --> 25:17.148
Virtually murdered
his own daughter,

25:17.230 --> 25:18.147
I don't want this!

25:18.190 --> 25:18.980
It feels nice!

25:19.023 --> 25:19.856
believing she was a Tokoloshe.

25:19.940 --> 25:20.980
I don't want this!

25:21.064 --> 25:22.979
But you love it!

25:59.057 --> 26:01.682
I know you have to leave that
place.

26:02.472 --> 26:03.931
I have a plan...

26:05.346 --> 26:07.096
...I promise you my sister.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.213
Sir?

26:58.504 --> 26:59.504
Sir?

27:04.003 --> 27:05.711
It's me, the girl from the bus.

27:05.795 --> 27:08.169
Ah, my stubborn
little daughter.

27:10.252 --> 27:11.585
My name is Busi.

27:13.043 --> 27:14.918
I'm sorry for yesterday.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.376
I should not have been rude.

27:18.292 --> 27:19.375
Don't worry about it.

27:23.167 --> 27:23.999
Wait!

27:31.998 --> 27:33.248
The offer still stands.

27:34.454 --> 27:36.704
Tea, talk, or both.

27:38.747 --> 27:39.579
Both.

27:55.119 --> 27:56.785
Sometimes...

27:56.868 --> 27:59.993
...a week can go by with no one
coming in...

28:00.825 --> 28:01.741
...because...

28:02.199 --> 28:03.284
...I forget to switch the lights
on.

28:07.073 --> 28:08.323
There we go.

28:10.241 --> 28:11.698
Let me put the kettle on.

28:12.697 --> 28:14.072
You make these masks?

28:16.115 --> 28:17.281
Every one of them.

28:20.071 --> 28:20.906
How?

28:23.155 --> 28:24.155
My child...

28:26.820 --> 28:30.069
...spiritual healers don't need
eyes...

28:30.319 --> 28:31.819
...to see the spiritual world.

28:33.193 --> 28:34.860
Even the hands...

28:36.528 --> 28:38.360
...they get used to the work.

28:43.110 --> 28:44.192
They are...

28:47.401 --> 28:48.401
Ugly?

28:48.734 --> 28:49.650
Scary?

28:51.400 --> 28:53.233
They are supposed to be scary...

28:53.690 --> 28:56.106
...because the evil spirits...

28:57.107 --> 28:59.981
...will be scared away by them.

29:06.605 --> 29:08.022
They are beautiful.

29:10.561 --> 29:11.561
Tea?

29:13.061 --> 29:14.771
Tell me my child...

29:16.395 --> 29:18.560
...what has brought you to this
Godforsaken place?

29:22.934 --> 29:24.394
I came here because of work.

29:31.725 --> 29:33.600
You shouldn't be smoking.

29:35.182 --> 29:37.266
That's like my little
Dina used to say.

29:39.141 --> 29:40.099
Don't smoke.

29:43.223 --> 29:44.598
You see my daughter...

29:46.973 --> 29:48.472
...these masks...

29:49.597 --> 29:52.347
...you see on the wall of my
place...

29:53.428 --> 29:55.220
...they have great powers within
them.

29:55.303 --> 29:56.470
What?

29:58.637 --> 30:00.720
Secrets.

30:02.137 --> 30:05.301
What's troubling you so much my
child?

30:06.261 --> 30:07.761
I left my sister alone...

30:11.343 --> 30:13.551
...and I don't know how I'm
going to get her here.

30:19.466 --> 30:22.258
Where is your sister right now?

30:26.797 --> 30:27.797
I must go.

30:31.964 --> 30:32.964
Forgive me.

30:38.255 --> 30:40.962
I did not mean to offend you.

30:41.754 --> 30:42.629
No...

30:43.294 --> 30:44.294
...you didn't.

30:50.628 --> 30:51.710
Take one.

30:54.042 --> 30:55.042
No sir.

30:55.417 --> 30:56.417
I can't.

30:58.541 --> 31:00.291
Take one, my child!

31:01.876 --> 31:03.790
It's my way of apologizing.

31:41.368 --> 31:44.408
Lumukhanda, the cannibal chief.

31:48.825 --> 31:53.199
This is a very powerful weapon
with great strength.

31:53.824 --> 31:56.823
There are many folktales about
Lumukhanda...

31:57.780 --> 31:59.865
...battling against evil forces.

32:01.072 --> 32:04.489
He's wise as he is mischievous.

32:09.278 --> 32:11.902
I will make a trade with you.

32:15.820 --> 32:19.152
You take the mask and
take this lighter.

32:21.651 --> 32:22.610
No, Sir.

32:22.693 --> 32:25.026
Lighter must be worth...

32:25.650 --> 32:26.775
Take the mask...

32:26.860 --> 32:28.899
...and help me to stop smoking.

32:31.234 --> 32:32.234
I'm old...

32:34.023 --> 32:36.023
...don't argue with me.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.104
At the
tone, record your message.

32:55.187 --> 32:56.645
To end press hash.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.728
I've been leaving you
voicemails...

33:01.811 --> 33:02.811
...I'm worried.

33:04.767 --> 33:05.892
Anyway,

33:06.935 --> 33:08.185
I got you a present.

33:10.141 --> 33:11.516
I hope you love it.

33:13.351 --> 33:14.351
Call me!

34:49.958 --> 34:51.498
What will I do?

34:54.165 --> 34:55.831
What will I do?

35:24.492 --> 35:25.742
You're back.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.075
I need the job.

35:33.283 --> 35:34.282
You do.

35:37.824 --> 35:38.907
You need a cleaner.

35:43.114 --> 35:45.072
Why
should I take you back?

35:51.529 --> 35:52.862
Do I have the job or not?

36:11.108 --> 36:12.317
That depends.

36:16.025 --> 36:16.857
Come here.

36:19.399 --> 36:20.899
I said, come here.

36:27.980 --> 36:30.022
I'm keeping half of
this week's wages

36:31.897 --> 36:33.979
to replace the uniform you tore.

36:35.563 --> 36:37.063
They're expensive.

36:46.561 --> 36:48.351
And where have you been?

36:48.435 --> 36:49.268
Hmm?

36:50.726 --> 36:51.560
Sick.

36:52.518 --> 36:53.351
Oh.

37:00.141 --> 37:00.974
So.

37:05.015 --> 37:06.682
That didn't take
you long at all.

37:11.472 --> 37:13.347
Wipe that look off your
pretty little face.

37:14.514 --> 37:16.930
Did I not tell you to
stay away from him?

37:31.593 --> 37:33.177
I don't want to!

37:33.927 --> 37:35.093
I don't want to!

37:36.801 --> 37:39.092
But we are going to have fun.

37:39.176 --> 37:40.801
We'll be together.

37:43.508 --> 37:44.716
No, I don't want that.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.840
I told you, I don't want to!

37:56.923 --> 37:57.755
Hey.

37:59.922 --> 38:01.255
You should not be down here.

38:03.671 --> 38:05.337
Don't come closer!

38:18.044 --> 38:19.376
Why?

38:21.834 --> 38:23.334
He forbids it.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.500
Who?

38:33.249 --> 38:34.791
The tokoloshe!

38:37.873 --> 38:39.165
There is nothing there.

38:45.205 --> 38:46.204
Get rid of her!

38:48.038 --> 38:49.871
Please stop what you are doing!

38:50.871 --> 38:51.870
Look at me!

38:53.537 --> 38:54.537
Look at me!

38:56.494 --> 38:59.202
I don't like the way he plays...

38:59.869 --> 39:01.202
...he plays rough.

39:02.368 --> 39:03.368
What?

39:05.535 --> 39:06.535
It's you...

39:07.284 --> 39:08.659
...from the other day.

39:11.450 --> 39:12.449
There is nothing there.

39:15.199 --> 39:16.574
Come! Let's go!

39:18.573 --> 39:20.698
Let's go! I need to get back to
work.

39:21.782 --> 39:24.114
Come, child, let's go.

39:24.739 --> 39:25.739
Let's go!

40:00.150 --> 40:01.732
Is this your ward?

40:02.024 --> 40:03.774
Yes. It's me... alone.

40:07.523 --> 40:09.148
Come. Let's get you to bed.

40:11.272 --> 40:12.188
I don't want to...

40:12.272 --> 40:14.105
...he's here. I know he's here!

40:15.605 --> 40:16.521
You know what...

40:16.604 --> 40:17.604
...I don't have time for this...

40:17.687 --> 40:19.104
...I need to go back to work.

40:19.729 --> 40:21.603
Come. Get In.

40:22.228 --> 40:23.603
Come. Get In!

40:29.477 --> 40:30.477
What's this?

40:32.518 --> 40:34.476
It's him. The tokoloshe.

40:34.559 --> 40:37.517
He's under the bed, waiting for
you to leave.

40:41.725 --> 40:43.724
There is nothing to be scared
of...

40:43.807 --> 40:44.849
...everything is going to be
okay.

40:44.932 --> 40:46.016
You have all these toys...

40:46.099 --> 40:47.849
...and the nurses will
constantly check up on you.

40:47.932 --> 40:48.765
No!

40:51.598 --> 40:53.056
Which one is your favorite toy?

40:53.140 --> 40:55.889
This one or this one? Which one?

40:57.639 --> 40:58.639
This one?

40:59.596 --> 41:00.804
What is its name?

41:00.888 --> 41:01.721
It's Gumo.

41:01.804 --> 41:02.679
It's Gumo?

41:03.013 --> 41:04.595
Okay, let me put him in here...

41:04.678 --> 41:05.803
...here is Gumo.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.053
Okay. Don't be afraid.

41:08.137 --> 41:09.387
Everything will be alright.

41:15.051 --> 41:16.260
What's this?

41:16.343 --> 41:17.718
Can I get a hug?

41:19.051 --> 41:20.051
A hug?

41:31.090 --> 41:32.757
Okay, sleep well.

41:34.215 --> 41:35.173
No!

41:36.672 --> 41:38.172
Please?

41:38.672 --> 41:40.256
Okay. I will leave it on.

41:41.131 --> 41:42.838
I will come and check up on you
later.

43:04.406 --> 43:07.864
Gumo, he's here.

43:13.238 --> 43:17.279
Why is this little girl hiding?

43:20.862 --> 43:22.278
I told you...

43:23.444 --> 43:25.736
...I don't want to play with you
anymore

44:02.812 --> 44:04.562
Gracie.

45:14.007 --> 45:15.215
Who are you, ma'am?

45:15.298 --> 45:16.506
My name is Busi Zondi.

45:16.590 --> 45:18.756
I'm one of the cleaners.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.339
Can I see your ID, please?

45:20.422 --> 45:21.255
Yes, sir.

45:26.421 --> 45:28.588
Sir, what's going on?

45:28.671 --> 45:29.588
There was an accident.

45:29.671 --> 45:30.587
Warren, please!

45:33.170 --> 45:35.087
Thank you, ma'am.

45:35.170 --> 45:36.169
Thank you, sir.

45:36.252 --> 45:37.377
Busi.

45:39.336 --> 45:41.501
My baby's, my baby's gone.

45:46.418 --> 45:47.250
Which one?

45:49.542 --> 45:50.375
Busi.

45:50.459 --> 45:51.874
Which one?

45:51.958 --> 45:53.041
I know we don't
each other all that well.

45:53.124 --> 45:54.124
Busi, please.

45:54.208 --> 45:55.791
Which one?

45:56.833 --> 45:58.040
Busi.

45:58.123 --> 46:00.082
Which one?

46:00.165 --> 46:00.998
Busi.

46:01.957 --> 46:03.706
Please, please.

46:03.789 --> 46:04.789
Please tell them for me.

46:04.872 --> 46:07.414
They run around on their own.

46:07.497 --> 46:08.996
Please, I beg you.

46:10.746 --> 46:11.580
Gracie.

46:11.663 --> 46:13.162
My baby's gone.

46:13.245 --> 46:15.120
Gracie.

46:18.869 --> 46:19.703
Gracie?

46:23.411 --> 46:24.827
Gracie, where are you?

46:27.077 --> 46:27.910
Gracie?

46:32.659 --> 46:33.492
Gracie?

46:36.616 --> 46:38.366
What is it?

46:38.450 --> 46:39.450
What is it, Gracie?

46:39.824 --> 46:40.824
What is it?

46:48.031 --> 46:49.031
What happened?

46:50.281 --> 46:51.280
What happened?

46:52.280 --> 46:53.280
Tell me!

46:57.737 --> 46:58.737
He's back!

47:00.654 --> 47:03.278
I told you he'll come back!

47:05.153 --> 47:06.652
I'm sorry.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.735
I'm sorry, Gracie.

47:09.069 --> 47:09.985
I'm sorry.

47:11.152 --> 47:13.943
I'm sorry.

47:14.318 --> 47:16.234
I don't want to be here anymore.

47:16.943 --> 47:17.942
I don't want to!

47:22.649 --> 47:23.816
Do you want to go with me?

47:47.187 --> 47:48.270
Hurry up!

48:12.390 --> 48:14.182
Okay, alright.

48:15.015 --> 48:16.347
Do you see that security guard?

48:18.722 --> 48:19.556
Okay.

48:20.181 --> 48:21.513
I will go over there to distract
him...

48:21.596 --> 48:23.638
...you will sneak
around him and wait for me.

48:23.680 --> 48:24.513
Okay.

48:24.596 --> 48:25.430
Okay.

48:26.637 --> 48:29.137
Are we hiding because we did
something wrong?

48:30.554 --> 48:31.387
No...

48:31.719 --> 48:32.719
...not you.

48:38.968 --> 48:39.927
Yes, sir.

48:41.260 --> 48:42.759
All in order, sir.

48:44.426 --> 48:45.759
Copy.

48:46.509 --> 48:47.509
Hello, my brother.

48:47.592 --> 48:48.841
- Yes, ma'am.
- How are you?

48:48.925 --> 48:49.800
I am fine.

48:49.883 --> 48:50.800
May I ask you something?

48:50.883 --> 48:52.758
Where can I find the nearest
shop?

48:53.549 --> 48:55.090
You see over there...

48:55.632 --> 48:56.757
...you walk straight...

48:57.465 --> 48:58.673
...turn left.

48:58.756 --> 48:59.589
Yes, ma'am.

48:59.673 --> 49:00.714
You turn left...

49:00.798 --> 49:03.298
...and at the corner you will
see the shop.

49:03.381 --> 49:04.755
Thank you very much my, brother.

49:04.838 --> 49:06.172
You are welcome, sister.

49:18.170 --> 49:19.170
We fooled him!

49:19.586 --> 49:21.710
Yes, let's go.

49:29.126 --> 49:30.126
Where are we going now?

49:35.957 --> 49:36.957
We are going home.

49:39.499 --> 49:41.873
Does that mean I won't ever have
to go back there?

49:43.915 --> 49:45.206
It depends...

49:46.081 --> 49:47.705
...do you have parents?

49:48.580 --> 49:51.247
Yes, but they were not good to
me.

50:44.612 --> 50:45.569
Are we here?

50:45.653 --> 50:47.028
Yes, we are here.

50:48.361 --> 50:49.361
You live here?

50:49.861 --> 50:51.818
Yes, come.

51:06.190 --> 51:07.524
The lights are out again...

51:07.607 --> 51:08.649
...come.

51:14.523 --> 51:15.731
Who do you stay with?

51:17.480 --> 51:18.813
I stay alone.

51:20.772 --> 51:22.771
But where is your family?

51:25.479 --> 51:26.521
Don't be scared...

51:26.937 --> 51:28.645
...you are safe now!

51:32.186 --> 51:33.310
This lighter...

51:33.894 --> 51:34.894
...there we go.

51:35.560 --> 51:36.727
Okay.

51:39.934 --> 51:41.393
Alright.

51:41.476 --> 51:42.309
Okay.

51:46.183 --> 51:47.767
I am going to fix everything...

51:47.850 --> 51:48.849
...you'll see.

51:54.931 --> 51:55.765
Okay.

51:57.181 --> 51:58.015
Yes.

51:59.431 --> 52:00.264
Okay.

52:15.137 --> 52:18.802
Huh?

52:31.175 --> 52:33.091
What am I going to do?

52:42.007 --> 52:43.756
What are you doing here?

52:44.297 --> 52:45.131
How did you get here?

52:45.214 --> 52:46.256
Hello?

52:46.339 --> 52:47.838
Where are you?

52:49.588 --> 52:51.713
But I don't want to play now.

52:52.713 --> 52:54.129
I couldn't take
the work anymore.

52:54.212 --> 52:56.379
It's gone crazy here.

52:56.462 --> 52:58.378
Thabang's accident.

52:58.461 --> 53:01.919
They were speaking
about some money.

53:02.003 --> 53:04.210
Do you know anything about it?

53:04.293 --> 53:07.377
Maybe.

53:07.460 --> 53:09.209
Busi.

53:09.292 --> 53:11.834
The work was too hard.

53:11.917 --> 53:13.376
Be honest with me.

53:13.459 --> 53:16.500
Do you know what
happened to Thabang?

53:17.708 --> 53:18.791
Why are you asking?

53:20.165 --> 53:22.374
The cops
are asking questions.

53:25.039 --> 53:27.623
About
Thabang or the money?

53:27.706 --> 53:31.413
Thabang, I don't
care about that idiot's money!

53:31.497 --> 53:34.038
Look, I know
nothing about Thabang, Rosie.

53:37.662 --> 53:39.496
I took Ruatonim's money.

53:39.579 --> 53:40.496
You what?

53:40.579 --> 53:42.370
I had to take it!

53:42.453 --> 53:43.286
He's a thief!

53:44.995 --> 53:47.660
I have to save my sister, Rosie.

53:47.744 --> 53:49.577
She needs me, she's alone.

53:49.660 --> 53:50.827
I can feel it.

53:55.493 --> 53:56.700
So what did you say to them?

53:56.783 --> 53:58.200
Jesus, girl, nothing!

54:01.825 --> 54:03.699
Have they
asked about Gracie?

54:04.657 --> 54:05.991
Gracie, who's Gracie?

54:09.406 --> 54:11.198
Hello?

54:11.281 --> 54:12.531
Rosie?

54:12.615 --> 54:13.447
Hello?

54:13.905 --> 54:15.364
Where are you?

54:31.736 --> 54:33.319
Show yourself?

54:34.360 --> 54:35.276
I can't see you...

54:35.360 --> 54:36.360
...where are you?

55:31.225 --> 55:32.557
Gracie!

55:32.640 --> 55:33.474
Gracie?

55:35.515 --> 55:36.390
Gracie, where are you?

55:47.763 --> 55:48.721
Busi!

55:48.804 --> 55:49.637
Busi!

55:50.846 --> 55:52.179
- Busi!
- Gracie!

56:19.632 --> 56:20.466
Gracie.

56:22.090 --> 56:23.090
It's him!

56:23.381 --> 56:24.215
Who is it?

56:24.465 --> 56:25.922
- It's him!
- Who?

56:26.005 --> 56:28.630
He followed us from the
hospital.

56:28.964 --> 56:29.797
Who is it?

56:29.880 --> 56:30.714
Who is it, Gracie?

56:30.797 --> 56:31.796
The tokoloshe!

56:34.963 --> 56:35.921
No.

56:36.962 --> 56:38.253
He's in the bedroom.

56:39.003 --> 56:40.003
The bedroom?

56:43.502 --> 56:44.502
Are you talking about the mask?

56:45.502 --> 56:46.502
Lumukhanda?

56:47.501 --> 56:48.501
Who?

56:49.376 --> 56:50.793
It's Lumukhanda baby.

56:51.876 --> 56:52.875
Lumukhanda.

56:53.584 --> 56:55.625
His job is to chase away evil
spirits.

56:56.875 --> 56:57.958
Don't be scared...

56:58.041 --> 56:59.041
...come

56:59.416 --> 57:00.416
I will introduce you.

57:01.083 --> 57:02.083
Don't be scared.

57:13.497 --> 57:16.371
He looks that way so he can
scare the evil away.

57:17.496 --> 57:18.996
Come, let's go.

58:04.279 --> 58:05.237
No!

58:05.279 --> 58:06.112
It's nice!

59:11.766 --> 59:13.183
I don't want to!

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.500
Jakes, if that's you,
I am going to kill you.

01:00:42.957 --> 01:00:43.791
Who is it?

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:44.874
Go back to sleep.

01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:59.954
What did I say the
first time we met, hmm?

01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:03.995
What did I say?

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:09.119
Trouble, that's what
I said you were.

01:01:11.036 --> 01:01:11.869
Trouble.

01:01:14.368 --> 01:01:16.451
Where's my money?

01:01:21.534 --> 01:01:22.659
What money?

01:01:27.741 --> 01:01:29.033
Please, please.

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.990
Please, sir.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.073
Please.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.526
Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:06.317
Where are you going?

01:02:20.648 --> 01:02:21.481
Busi?

01:02:23.313 --> 01:02:24.147
Busi?

01:03:09.472 --> 01:03:10.804
Gracie?

01:03:12.804 --> 01:03:15.263
Gracie where are you?

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.137
I'm sorry, Gracie.

01:03:20.845 --> 01:03:21.844
I'm sorry.

01:03:43.673 --> 01:03:44.507
Hey!

01:04:19.876 --> 01:04:21.083
Gracie, don't go anywhere.

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:36.997
Lindi?

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:40.913
Lindi?

01:04:45.579 --> 01:04:47.203
Why are you calling me from
Lindi's phone?

01:04:48.411 --> 01:04:49.620
Busi, please listen to me.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:51.911
I want to speak with Lindi.

01:04:58.076 --> 01:05:00.534
Busi... your sister.

01:05:01.076 --> 01:05:03.492
I said I want to speak with
Lindi, not you.

01:05:07.617 --> 01:05:09.616
She is dead.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.240
How?

01:05:19.572 --> 01:05:21.905
I don't know anymore.

01:05:22.447 --> 01:05:23.947
I asked, how?

01:05:26.238 --> 01:05:27.946
She killed herself!

01:07:36.672 --> 01:07:38.004
Mom.

01:07:50.252 --> 01:07:52.211
I was not expecting you!

01:08:14.913 --> 01:08:17.037
I'm happy...

01:08:17.412 --> 01:08:19.371
...you managed to come for the
funeral.

01:08:20.287 --> 01:08:22.703
Even your father will be happy
to see you.

01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:29.743
Where is he?

01:08:31.326 --> 01:08:32.326
He's with his daughter,

01:08:33.285 --> 01:08:34.285
Where else would he be?

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:42.073
I am not surprised.

01:08:46.073 --> 01:08:48.073
This is all a disgrace.

01:09:07.029 --> 01:09:07.861
A disgrace.

01:09:10.944 --> 01:09:12.028
A disgrace for who?

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:18.193
A disgrace for who?

01:09:20.067 --> 01:09:21.317
A disgrace for who?

01:09:26.234 --> 01:09:27.234
You are our mother.

01:09:28.774 --> 01:09:29.649
You were supposed
to proctect us...

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:30.733
...where were you?

01:09:32.483 --> 01:09:33.483
You were not there!

01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:36.064
I know.

01:09:36.148 --> 01:09:38.148
You let them do
whatever with us...

01:09:39.107 --> 01:09:40.106
...you let him.

01:09:41.272 --> 01:09:42.104
You let him.

01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:43.772
No my child, I did not.

01:09:45.064 --> 01:09:46.729
You killed my sister!

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:49.270
It was you!

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:51.228
It was you!

01:09:52.813 --> 01:09:54.063
You are not my mother!

01:11:09.549 --> 01:11:11.755
I don't want to stay here
anymore.

01:11:13.798 --> 01:11:16.629
We won't stay long.

01:11:18.879 --> 01:11:22.546
It's like dead people are
talking to me.

01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:22.201
I am sorry dear sister.

01:12:50.737 --> 01:12:52.779
We didn't know that you were
coming.

01:12:54.611 --> 01:12:57.735
Are you going to stay a few
days?

01:13:30.022 --> 01:13:32.188
You have a lot of questions
today.

01:13:35.562 --> 01:13:37.312
It belonged to me and my sister.

01:13:40.645 --> 01:13:41.811
Come, let's play.

01:13:49.894 --> 01:13:51.184
Let's sleep.

01:13:53.518 --> 01:13:54.393
Yes, let's sleep.

01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:58.517
Okay, let's go to sleep.

01:14:03.516 --> 01:14:04.516
There we go.

01:14:05.973 --> 01:14:07.847
Which prayer do you want to
recite?

01:14:08.847 --> 01:14:11.514
Now I lay me down to sleep.

01:14:13.471 --> 01:14:14.846
Okay, you can pray.

01:14:17.845 --> 01:14:20.678
May God guide me
through the night

01:14:20.763 --> 01:14:24.594
and wake me up in the
morning light, amen.

01:14:44.465 --> 01:14:46.215
Where is he?

01:14:47.008 --> 01:14:48.964
At his place.

01:15:25.167 --> 01:15:26.416
Busi!

01:16:00.035 --> 01:16:01.035
Gumo?

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:07.075
Gumo, come here.

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:13.367
Gumo?

01:16:24.197 --> 01:16:25.446
Busi!

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.653
Come...

01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:34.321
...let's go.

01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.983
Lindi!

01:17:00.815 --> 01:17:01.648
Lindi?

01:17:03.023 --> 01:17:03.857
Lindi?

01:17:22.936 --> 01:17:23.768
Gracie!

01:17:26.228 --> 01:17:27.060
Gracie.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.142
Gracie.

01:17:32.852 --> 01:17:33.684
Gracie!

01:17:40.182 --> 01:17:41.015
Gracie?

01:17:44.724 --> 01:17:45.556
Gracie?

01:17:57.138 --> 01:17:57.972
Gracie, let's go.

01:17:58.513 --> 01:17:59.347
But she's looking for you.

01:17:59.429 --> 01:18:00.262
Who?

01:18:00.347 --> 01:18:01.303
Lindi.

01:18:05.262 --> 01:18:06.261
Come.

01:18:30.173 --> 01:18:31.006
No.

01:18:31.091 --> 01:18:32.007
We are not going there.

01:18:32.091 --> 01:18:33.340
But she's inside.

01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:34.881
We not going in there.

01:18:35.297 --> 01:18:36.630
Busi!

01:18:39.755 --> 01:18:41.047
Lindi.

01:18:45.713 --> 01:18:46.545
Come.

01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:48.171
We are not going in there.

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.419
But...

01:18:49.503 --> 01:18:50.337
...come.

01:18:50.419 --> 01:18:51.919
We are not going
in there, let's go!

01:18:52.003 --> 01:18:53.170
But she is inside.

01:18:53.253 --> 01:18:54.086
Who?

01:18:54.168 --> 01:18:55.126
It's Lindi.

01:19:15.957 --> 01:19:16.789
Shh.

01:19:21.831 --> 01:19:22.663
Busi.

01:19:25.538 --> 01:19:26.537
Lindi.

01:19:26.621 --> 01:19:27.455
Busi!

01:19:28.787 --> 01:19:29.620
Is this really you?

01:19:30.621 --> 01:19:32.079
You finally came.

01:19:32.829 --> 01:19:33.829
Not soon enough though.

01:19:35.411 --> 01:19:36.868
It doesn't matter anymore...

01:19:37.578 --> 01:19:39.494
...I know you've always been
trying.

01:19:39.994 --> 01:19:42.660
It doesn't matter, I've let you
down.

01:19:43.534 --> 01:19:45.409
No, you didn't.

01:19:46.493 --> 01:19:47.992
It doesn't matter now.

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:50.409
Now is the time...

01:19:50.492 --> 01:19:52.575
...to live our lives.

01:20:04.614 --> 01:20:06.073
He's coming.

01:20:06.155 --> 01:20:07.823

01:20:13.447 --> 01:20:14.446
Hurry up, Busi.

01:20:25.485 --> 01:20:26.444
He's coming!

01:20:27.776 --> 01:20:29.194
The lighter.

01:20:29.526 --> 01:20:30.358
The lighter.

01:20:30.443 --> 01:20:31.275
He's coming.

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:32.359
The lighter.

Come.
