WEBVTT

00:00.461 --> 00:02.733
Previously on Scream Queens...

00:03.080 --> 00:05.875
Looks like we're gonna need to
call a Green Meanie summit.

00:05.953 --> 00:08.709
We are here to review the
past and future kills.

00:10.093 --> 00:13.228
Chanel Oberlin <i>fried
my sister's face off.</i>

00:13.296 --> 00:15.831
Help me!

00:15.899 --> 00:17.833
I'm Chanel #3, Cassidy's girlfriend.

00:17.901 --> 00:19.968
She is going to have to die.

00:20.036 --> 00:21.904
<i>We can put Denise in the freezer</i>

00:21.971 --> 00:23.806
until they find a cure
for being electrocuted.

00:25.642 --> 00:27.846
<i>You, Dr. Brock
Holt,</i> are a killer.

00:28.268 --> 00:31.880
<i>I have a disease called Kuru.</i> It
is terminal. I'll be dead in a month.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.582
You guys are gonna kill me, aren't you?

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.705 --> 01:29.838
Chanel?

02:09.746 --> 02:11.013
Holy crap!

02:14.517 --> 02:16.285
I'm sorry.

02:16.352 --> 02:18.166
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

02:18.191 --> 02:19.625
Thanks for not killing me.

02:19.692 --> 02:20.926
I don't want this anymore.

02:20.994 --> 02:22.094
What about your mom, though?

02:22.162 --> 02:23.962
I'm gonna have to kill her.

02:24.030 --> 02:25.631
Doesn't that seem a little extreme?

02:25.698 --> 02:26.932
How about you just talk to her?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.100
Oh, yeah.

02:28.168 --> 02:29.802
That could work, too.

02:29.869 --> 02:31.603
You not killing me and
standing up to your mom

02:31.671 --> 02:34.106
is totally turning me on.

02:34.174 --> 02:35.674
How 'bout I go home and
take a quick whore's bath

02:35.742 --> 02:36.909
and you meet me in a half an hour?

02:36.976 --> 02:38.110
Mm...

02:38.178 --> 02:39.578
mm-Kay.

02:39.646 --> 02:40.746
I'll see you then.

02:45.185 --> 02:46.251
Oh, my gosh.

02:46.319 --> 02:48.253
These Chanels are impossible to kill.

02:48.321 --> 02:49.955
It's almost like their narcissism

02:50.023 --> 02:51.090
and stupidity create some kind

02:51.157 --> 02:52.357
of a force field around them.

02:52.425 --> 02:54.126
We have to think bigger.

02:54.194 --> 02:55.360
And we've got to make that happen, soon.

02:55.428 --> 02:56.462
I'm out, okay?

02:56.529 --> 02:57.696
I'm-I'm-I'm done.

02:57.764 --> 02:58.931
This is all you, now.

03:00.066 --> 03:01.900
Except for Chanel #3.

03:01.968 --> 03:03.135
If you touch her,

03:03.203 --> 03:04.570
then I'll gladly come out of retirement

03:04.637 --> 03:05.938
to end you.

03:06.005 --> 03:06.972
Listen up, pretty boy.

03:08.208 --> 03:09.775
If you're not part of the solution,

03:09.843 --> 03:11.510
then as far as I'm concerned,

03:11.578 --> 03:14.947
you are just another problem.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.495
Call E.C.C.
Nurse Hoffel, call E.C.C.

03:29.562 --> 03:31.296
We still on for dinner tonight?

03:31.364 --> 03:32.364
I'm a little bit confused as to

03:32.432 --> 03:33.632
whether we're still dating.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.200
I mean, I did try to strangle you

03:35.268 --> 03:36.368
and I would totally understand

03:36.436 --> 03:37.369
if you thought that was sort of,

03:37.437 --> 03:38.637
uh, crossing the line.

03:38.705 --> 03:40.172
It was, don't get me wrong.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.075
But there comes a point in
every long-term relationship

03:43.143 --> 03:44.643
where you feel like you just want to...

03:44.711 --> 03:46.378
strangle your partner!

03:46.446 --> 03:47.679
So, the fact that you actually did,

03:47.747 --> 03:49.148
means we are communicating
those feelings

03:49.215 --> 03:50.149
instead of burying them.

03:50.216 --> 03:51.350
Plus, I took the fact

03:51.417 --> 03:52.851
that you helped me, Number
Three and Number Five

03:52.919 --> 03:55.087
cheat on the MCATs as your
way of truly apologizing.

03:55.155 --> 03:56.388
You didn't help me cheat!

03:56.456 --> 03:57.823
Nobody helped me cheat!

03:57.891 --> 03:59.658
I almost got a perfect
score all by myself.

03:59.726 --> 04:01.827
We all almost got
perfect scores, Number Five.

04:01.895 --> 04:03.162
But I didn't cheat!

04:03.229 --> 04:05.597
Nobody cares!

04:05.665 --> 04:06.965
Anyway,

04:07.033 --> 04:08.167
we still on for dinner?

04:08.234 --> 04:09.168
Sure.

04:12.338 --> 04:13.305
Why can't you see the opportunity

04:13.373 --> 04:14.840
right in front of you?

04:14.908 --> 04:16.241
The only thing I see
right in front of me

04:16.309 --> 04:17.809
is a bedsore that's
progressing quite nicely,

04:17.877 --> 04:18.877
Mr. Locklear.

04:18.945 --> 04:20.411
All right, I want to keep you on, uh,

04:20.480 --> 04:22.314
silver sulfadiazine and nitrofurazone

04:22.382 --> 04:24.483
for a few more days, before we attempt

04:24.551 --> 04:25.817
another debridement, huh?

04:26.886 --> 04:27.886
Dean Munsch is dying.

04:27.954 --> 04:29.054
And soon.

04:29.122 --> 04:30.489
And her fortune is going into a trust

04:30.557 --> 04:31.990
that's being drafted on the premise

04:32.058 --> 04:33.025
that she doesn't have a next of kin.

04:33.092 --> 04:34.059
Which she doesn't,

04:34.127 --> 04:35.761
but she will, when you convince her

04:35.828 --> 04:37.196
- to marry you.
- What?

04:37.263 --> 04:39.932
Just... think about it.

04:39.999 --> 04:41.233
You two get hitched,

04:41.301 --> 04:42.601
she kicks it from the Kuru

04:42.669 --> 04:43.902
and bam!

04:43.970 --> 04:46.605
You're the fortune's trustee.

04:46.673 --> 04:48.073
If I'm in charge of the trust...

04:48.141 --> 04:49.274
We'll rob it from them blind.

04:49.342 --> 04:50.709
We'll run away together.

04:50.777 --> 04:52.945
Far, far away, where no one can find us.

04:53.012 --> 04:54.746
We'll fix up a boat on the beach,

04:54.814 --> 04:56.048
just like the last scene in <i>Shawshank.</i>

04:56.115 --> 04:57.416
No, I don't really like boats.

04:57.483 --> 04:59.051
Listen, we can buy Blood Island.

04:59.118 --> 05:00.552
We'll live there together.

05:00.620 --> 05:02.087
Just two murderers with no one to murder

05:02.155 --> 05:03.722
except for each other,
but we never will,

05:03.790 --> 05:05.057
because we love and trust each other.

05:05.124 --> 05:06.725
And believe me, Brock,

05:06.793 --> 05:09.728
no one understands you like I do.

05:09.796 --> 05:11.863
I will always be there for you.

05:11.931 --> 05:13.265
And I will always...

05:14.300 --> 05:15.867
let you attack my crack.

05:17.070 --> 05:18.870
Even when I've had a really large meal

05:18.938 --> 05:21.707
and I'm unsure of what you
might encounter up there.

05:21.774 --> 05:23.075
Now you lost me.

05:23.142 --> 05:24.109
We can buy

05:24.177 --> 05:25.444
Blood Island and we can fill it

05:25.511 --> 05:26.945
with boatloads of tourists.

05:27.013 --> 05:28.280
Then we'll knock 'em off one by one

05:28.348 --> 05:30.082
<i>Most Dangerous Game</i> style.

05:30.950 --> 05:33.919
Extreme tourism is quite hot right now.

05:33.987 --> 05:35.387
See?

05:35.455 --> 05:36.788
Yeah, but this plan is too elaborate.

05:36.856 --> 05:37.923
If you stop and think about it...

05:37.991 --> 05:39.391
Don't think about it.

05:39.459 --> 05:40.759
This plan

05:40.827 --> 05:42.261
seems impossible

05:42.328 --> 05:43.662
until it's possible.

05:43.730 --> 05:45.097
In fact,

05:45.164 --> 05:46.565
it's inevitable.

05:51.204 --> 05:52.671
Okay. All right.

05:54.073 --> 05:55.507
I'll, uh,

05:55.575 --> 05:57.009
I'll think about it.

06:08.454 --> 06:09.921
Moebius?

06:09.989 --> 06:12.824
It's Daria. Daria Janssen.

06:12.892 --> 06:15.327
Whatever. What are you doing out here?

06:15.395 --> 06:16.895
Well,

06:16.963 --> 06:18.897
I love fresh tomatoes.

06:18.965 --> 06:20.932
I checked the pH of the swamp,

06:21.000 --> 06:22.934
and concluded that the rich humus

06:23.002 --> 06:24.836
that settles at the bottom

06:24.904 --> 06:27.039
would make a fantastic

06:27.106 --> 06:29.274
nitrogen-rich fertilizer. The...

06:29.342 --> 06:31.376
tomatoes appear to be glowing slightly.

06:32.537 --> 06:33.845
Don't light that!

06:33.913 --> 06:35.947
This stuff is highly flammable.

06:36.015 --> 06:37.316
One spark and

06:37.383 --> 06:40.018
that much fertilizer would kill us both.

06:40.086 --> 06:40.819
Duh.

06:43.022 --> 06:44.022
Duh.

06:50.173 --> 06:51.366
_

06:52.689 --> 06:54.556
_

06:57.509 --> 06:59.992
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

07:00.017 --> 07:02.328
What? Okay, get this.

07:02.353 --> 07:04.321
Last night, I spent the night at Dr.
Hot's house

07:04.389 --> 07:05.822
and as soon as he fell
asleep, I snatched his phone

07:05.890 --> 07:07.557
and started going through
it for hours and hours.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.092
Wait. Are you supposed to do that?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.328
Hello? He's my boyfriend.

07:11.396 --> 07:13.330
He trusts me enough not
to do that kind of thing,

07:13.398 --> 07:15.599
which makes it really easy for
me to do that kind of thing.

07:15.666 --> 07:16.900
Your total ignorance about
how relationships work

07:16.968 --> 07:18.268
is probably the reason why

07:18.336 --> 07:19.302
all your boyfriends get murdered.

07:19.370 --> 07:21.271
What? That has nothing

07:21.339 --> 07:24.141
to do with my boyfriends being murdered.

07:24.208 --> 07:25.642
Yeah. Keep telling yourself that.

07:25.710 --> 07:26.743
Anyway,

07:26.811 --> 07:28.845
I went through his browser history

07:28.913 --> 07:31.314
and he was googling...

07:32.583 --> 07:33.417
cheap engagement rings.

07:33.484 --> 07:34.885
"How quickly

07:34.952 --> 07:36.319
can I get a cheap engagement ring?"

07:36.387 --> 07:37.721
I mean, do you know what this means?

07:37.789 --> 07:38.889
Oh, my God.

07:38.956 --> 07:40.857
Brock is gonna propose to me!

07:44.529 --> 07:45.962
Oh, my God!

07:46.030 --> 07:47.531
Shut up!

07:48.800 --> 07:50.367
Dr. Holt is asking everyone

07:50.435 --> 07:52.469
to gather in Dean Munsch's room.

08:09.954 --> 08:11.721
Chanel, I'm glad you're here.

08:11.789 --> 08:13.223
I'm glad everyone's here.

08:16.027 --> 08:17.327
I know this sounds crazy, but...

08:18.362 --> 08:19.329
I'm just gonna do it,

08:19.397 --> 08:20.497
'cause life is too short.

08:20.565 --> 08:21.298
It is!

08:26.304 --> 08:27.537
Will you marry me?

08:31.375 --> 08:32.342
Cathy?

08:34.879 --> 08:36.456
Oh...

08:36.589 --> 08:38.280
- What?!
- I just...

08:38.349 --> 08:40.951
I wasn't expecting this to happen.

08:41.018 --> 08:42.919
Nobody was expecting this to happen!

08:42.986 --> 08:45.288
Cathy, let's enjoy the
last few days of your life

08:45.356 --> 08:46.590
the way you should.

08:47.658 --> 08:49.392
You and I, as man and wife.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.014
Pounding?

08:51.077 --> 08:53.029
Yes, darling. Pounding.

08:55.032 --> 08:56.433
Yes.

08:56.501 --> 08:57.234
Of course.

08:57.301 --> 08:59.236
A thousand times, yes.

09:02.406 --> 09:03.740
Oh...

09:20.324 --> 09:22.025
Chanel?

09:25.830 --> 09:27.063
Oh, Chanel,

09:27.131 --> 09:29.799
I'm sorry. I should have told
you I was gonna do that.

09:29.867 --> 09:32.102
Propose to my mortal enemy?

09:32.170 --> 09:33.270
I think telling me about it

09:33.337 --> 09:35.238
was the least you could have done.

09:36.340 --> 09:37.607
What is happening?

09:37.675 --> 09:39.809
Oh, Dean Munsch is gonna die in a month,

09:39.877 --> 09:41.311
tops. I mean,

09:41.379 --> 09:42.412
think of my proposal as sort of...

09:42.480 --> 09:44.147
end-of-life care.

09:44.215 --> 09:46.516
Like a romantic hospice.

09:46.584 --> 09:49.619
Like, a Make-A-Wish
Foundation kind of thing?

09:49.687 --> 09:51.021
Yes, exactly.

09:51.088 --> 09:52.656
Like a Make-A-Wish Foundation thing.

09:52.723 --> 09:55.325
It's not fair!

09:55.393 --> 09:58.428
I mean, I'm dying, too.

09:58.496 --> 10:01.398
We all are, in a way.

10:01.465 --> 10:04.034
I mean, I want a hot doctor boyfriend.

10:05.336 --> 10:07.437
What does having a boyfriend
even mean to you?

10:07.505 --> 10:09.472
You're clearly not into sex.

10:09.540 --> 10:11.441
But what you are into

10:11.509 --> 10:17.080
is having someone to post adorable
relationship selfies with.

10:18.382 --> 10:21.184
My romantic social media footprint
is very important to me.

10:21.252 --> 10:23.887
I know it is. And that's why we're
gonna meet up three times a day,

10:23.955 --> 10:25.388
and we're gonna take cute-as-button

10:25.456 --> 10:28.692
pictures and-and you can
put the dog filter on,

10:28.759 --> 10:31.928
with the ears and the big tongue and
write silly little things on it.

10:31.996 --> 10:33.363
And you post it just like
we're a real couple.

10:33.431 --> 10:37.000
Because we are a real couple.

10:37.068 --> 10:39.069
- Okay.
- Okay?

10:39.136 --> 10:41.104
And then, maybe...

10:41.172 --> 10:43.440
just maybe...

10:43.507 --> 10:45.508
when Dean Munsch dies,

10:45.576 --> 10:49.913
I'll rip that ring off her cold,
dead finger and give it to you.

10:58.422 --> 11:00.223
Mom.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.493
As you can tell from Chanel
#3 still being alive...

11:05.162 --> 11:06.396
I have decided

11:06.464 --> 11:09.566
that I don't want to kill anymore.

11:09.634 --> 11:11.334
Everyone thinks Grace's
creepy dad was the killer.

11:11.402 --> 11:15.338
If no one else gets murdered from now
on, you basically got away with it all.

11:15.406 --> 11:19.409
I love you so much, Mom.

11:19.477 --> 11:22.345
I do.

11:22.413 --> 11:24.714
But I'm a healer.

11:24.782 --> 11:27.150
All this killing and revenge stuff,

11:27.218 --> 11:30.153
it's... it's you.

11:30.221 --> 11:32.756
It's not me.

11:38.462 --> 11:40.997
This ends when the
hospital is shut down.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.734
Don't try and get in my way.

11:44.802 --> 11:46.002
How can you talk to your son like that?

11:48.306 --> 11:49.739
He's no son of mine.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.176
He's all yours, Jezebel.

12:00.351 --> 12:01.985
How do you feel about
what just happened?

12:02.053 --> 12:04.120
I know I'm right.

12:04.188 --> 12:06.122
Your love has shown me that.

12:07.722 --> 12:09.489
But we have a bigger problem.

12:09.894 --> 12:12.495
Hoffel.

12:12.563 --> 12:15.432
She's the other Green Meanie.

12:15.499 --> 12:17.901
And I think she's got
something big planned.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.017
Did you get him?

12:49.085 --> 12:50.586
Of course.

12:51.721 --> 12:54.389
Oh! Hey.

12:54.457 --> 12:55.958
Hello!

12:56.025 --> 12:58.267
Wow.

12:58.322 --> 13:02.492
What? Is that Supreme Court
Justice Anthony Kennedy?

13:02.560 --> 13:04.027
I'm sure it's just a lookalike.

13:04.095 --> 13:05.829
Yeah.

13:05.897 --> 13:07.964
But how can we be sure?

13:08.032 --> 13:09.800
I was told
the participants would like

13:09.867 --> 13:11.168
to get this done quickly.

13:11.235 --> 13:13.804
Yes. Um, I don't have much time left.

13:16.741 --> 13:18.909
Understood.

13:18.976 --> 13:20.210
Sign here, please.

13:20.278 --> 13:22.579
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

13:22.647 --> 13:24.815
Um, I need a pen... Oh.

13:24.882 --> 13:26.850
Thank you, Hester.

13:30.054 --> 13:31.188
Sweet of you. Darling?

13:31.255 --> 13:32.255
What?

13:32.323 --> 13:34.057
Hmm. Oh.

13:36.093 --> 13:41.398
Okay. Assuming this gets notarized,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

13:44.769 --> 13:47.871
Ah!

13:53.110 --> 13:54.511
Hi.

13:54.579 --> 13:56.913
Sorry. I know you didn't
want to be disturbed.

13:56.981 --> 13:58.982
It's okay, Chanel #5.

13:59.050 --> 14:00.917
Considering that this is the
closest you will ever get

14:00.985 --> 14:03.887
to being married, I'm
gonna make an exception.

14:03.955 --> 14:06.823
Thank you. So, I have
done some research,

14:06.891 --> 14:09.759
and looked over your tests,

14:09.827 --> 14:12.262
and I don't think you have Kuru.
And if you do,

14:12.330 --> 14:14.231
you're probably only in the
second clinical stage...

14:14.298 --> 14:16.766
the sedentary stage... and
symptoms of that stage

14:16.834 --> 14:18.969
include not being able
to walk without support.

14:19.036 --> 14:20.570
Which I have. She has that.

14:20.638 --> 14:22.472
- Tremors. -
- See?

14:22.540 --> 14:24.875
Emotional instability, depression.

14:24.942 --> 14:27.444
Which I certainly have, because you...

14:27.511 --> 14:30.814
are wasting what little
precious time I have left.

14:30.882 --> 14:32.916
I, too, have researched Kuru, okay?

14:32.984 --> 14:34.918
<i>- Kuru.
- Kuru.</i>

14:34.986 --> 14:36.887
And sure, her symptoms may
be from something else,

14:36.954 --> 14:39.089
but this woman ate dead flesh
from the only known tribe

14:39.156 --> 14:41.958
to carry that disease on this planet.

14:42.026 --> 14:44.928
I mean, I'm sorry, but I feel
that our diagnosis is correct.

14:44.996 --> 14:46.596
I'm sorry, boo. Wait, but the only way

14:46.664 --> 14:48.965
to really know for sure is to
test a piece of her brain.

14:49.033 --> 14:52.802
What if we performed an awake
craniotomy to get the sample?

14:52.870 --> 14:55.071
If she's awake during the operation,

14:55.139 --> 14:57.941
we can ask her questions to make sure
that we're not getting close to any parts

14:58.009 --> 14:59.542
that she actually needs.

14:59.610 --> 15:00.777
You know,

15:00.845 --> 15:04.748
the brain is a weird piece of meat,

15:04.815 --> 15:06.950
and it's highly adaptable, I mean...

15:07.018 --> 15:09.819
But I'll be a vegetable for the
remaining weeks I have left.

15:09.887 --> 15:12.622
You're not seriously considering
this, are you, my love?

15:12.690 --> 15:15.025
Just saying, it would really
suck if you don't have Kuru

15:15.092 --> 15:16.993
and you do have something
that we could treat,

15:17.061 --> 15:18.995
but you die because we never knew.

15:19.063 --> 15:21.531
Plus, it's a badass surgery,

15:21.599 --> 15:24.668
I mean, I would look so cool in
front of my friends at Harvard.

15:24.735 --> 15:26.269
That's the school I went to, Harvard.

15:28.839 --> 15:30.707
Y-You know...

15:30.775 --> 15:32.208
you're right.

15:32.276 --> 15:33.944
If I don't have Kuru,

15:34.011 --> 15:38.214
that means you and I
have years and years

15:38.282 --> 15:42.352
and years and years of being
together ahead of us.

15:42.420 --> 15:44.387
That sounds great.

16:14.885 --> 16:15.986
Hello.

16:16.053 --> 16:17.821
Hello, Nurse Hoffel?

16:17.888 --> 16:19.889
It's Jane Hollis, Cassidy's mom.

16:19.957 --> 16:22.726
Uh, I'm a little busy.
Can I call you back?

16:22.793 --> 16:24.527
Oh, I just need a minute.

16:24.595 --> 16:27.597
Where are you? It
sounds like a big echo.

16:27.665 --> 16:29.666
In the basement.

16:29.734 --> 16:31.067
Ooh, that sounds fun.

16:31.135 --> 16:33.603
Is it a finished basement?

16:33.671 --> 16:35.839
- Jane!
- I always wanted one of those...

16:35.906 --> 16:37.207
I'm really sort of busy.

16:37.274 --> 16:39.342
Right, I'll just get to it.

16:39.410 --> 16:40.276
Listen.

16:40.344 --> 16:42.846
My son is dead to me.

16:42.913 --> 16:44.948
So now it's just you and me.

16:45.016 --> 16:47.851
I really appreciate all the
work you've been doing,

16:47.918 --> 16:50.920
and I wanted to offer my
help in finishing the job.

16:50.988 --> 16:53.857
I think I'm doing fine on my own.
Thank you.

16:55.793 --> 16:57.560
Oh.

16:57.628 --> 16:59.896
She hung up.

17:26.523 --> 17:30.060
I did everything
right, raising that boy.

17:30.127 --> 17:33.563
All I know is, I'm a
failure as a mother.

17:33.631 --> 17:34.964
Mm. Look,

17:35.032 --> 17:36.933
maybe you're feeling that way

17:37.001 --> 17:39.903
because you're seeing what
Cassidy did as letting you down.

17:39.970 --> 17:42.005
He did the right thing.

17:42.073 --> 17:43.673
Which means deep down,
he's a good person

17:43.741 --> 17:44.974
who knows right from wrong.

17:45.042 --> 17:46.076
Who taught him that?

17:46.143 --> 17:48.745
Well, he watches a lot of television.

17:48.813 --> 17:51.848
<i>Modern Family impacted him deeply.</i>

17:51.916 --> 17:54.184
It was you.

17:54.251 --> 17:56.586
I know what it's like to
lose someone you love.

17:56.654 --> 17:59.756
My boyfriend was murdered.

17:59.824 --> 18:02.792
I miss his big arm muscles every day.

18:02.860 --> 18:05.795
I miss my husband so much.

18:05.863 --> 18:09.599
His arm muscles weren't very big,

18:09.667 --> 18:11.434
but they were mine.

18:11.502 --> 18:13.837
As long as you keep focusing on revenge,

18:13.904 --> 18:15.672
you'll never get to truly grieve him.

18:17.061 --> 18:18.728
Let me show you the hospital.

18:19.210 --> 18:21.444
The new one your son helped build?

18:22.791 --> 18:24.619
The one that actually heals people.

18:30.421 --> 18:31.821
You can't go through with this.

18:31.889 --> 18:33.756
- Why?
- Because what if you cure her?

18:33.824 --> 18:35.024
I'm not gonna cure her.

18:35.092 --> 18:36.626
Look, I'm gonna go ahead
with the procedure,

18:36.694 --> 18:38.061
I'm gonna find out she's still dying,

18:38.129 --> 18:39.829
we'll cry a bunch, we'll
probably pound some,

18:39.897 --> 18:41.164
and then, in a few
weeks, she's gonna die

18:41.232 --> 18:42.499
and you and I will go to Blood Island.

18:42.566 --> 18:44.234
- I want you to kill her.
- What?

18:44.301 --> 18:44.818
Shh!

18:44.843 --> 18:46.393
No. I want you to kill
her during her surgery,

18:46.437 --> 18:50.006
and make it look like an accident.
Just say that you...

18:50.074 --> 18:51.207
remembered a scene,
from <i>Hills Have Eyes 2,</i>

18:51.275 --> 18:52.909
and you were overcome
with chills, like...

18:52.977 --> 18:55.178
I just remembered a
scene from <i>Hills Have Eyes 2</i>

18:55.246 --> 18:57.147
and I just sliced open her brain.
I'm such a klutz,

18:57.214 --> 18:58.681
and I'm never gonna watch
a scary movie ever again

18:58.749 --> 19:01.417
before a surgery. I
can't wait any longer.

19:01.485 --> 19:04.787
Okay? She's got to go. I want
to be sipping on Mai Tais,

19:04.855 --> 19:07.023
and I want to be hunting
down tourists within a week.

19:07.091 --> 19:09.826
Woman, calm down. Get ahold of yourself.

19:09.894 --> 19:12.328
I will not kill her during this surgery.

19:12.396 --> 19:14.831
If I botch this up, my
reputation will be destroyed.

19:14.899 --> 19:18.334
Okay, this whole plan depends
on Dean Munsch being dead.

19:18.402 --> 19:20.336
And if she's alive,

19:20.404 --> 19:23.506
then she gets to keep her money,
and I have to go back to prison,

19:23.574 --> 19:27.076
where I literally have to
draw porn to masturbate to,

19:27.144 --> 19:29.212
and I am a terrible artist.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.813
I'm not gonna do that again.

19:30.881 --> 19:32.682
No.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.684
So you kill her during the surgery,

19:34.752 --> 19:35.852
or else.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.320
Or else what?

19:37.388 --> 19:39.222
Oh. You heard me.

19:39.290 --> 19:41.090
Or else.

19:41.158 --> 19:43.626
I know... I know, or else what?

19:43.694 --> 19:45.762
Or else.

19:52.937 --> 19:54.904
Listen. Chanels.

19:54.972 --> 19:56.940
I'm going to let you
in on a little secret.

19:57.007 --> 19:59.876
I was only pretending to be cool
with Brock marrying Dean Munsch.

19:59.944 --> 20:01.277
Really, I'm not cool with it.

20:01.345 --> 20:02.946
You actually didn't seem
cool with it at all.

20:03.013 --> 20:04.714
It was very obvious.

20:04.782 --> 20:06.115
I'm gonna tell you something.

20:06.183 --> 20:07.884
I hate Dean Munsch.

20:07.952 --> 20:10.320
I hated her when she made
us take those gross pledges

20:10.387 --> 20:11.888
into Kappa House that all got murdered,

20:11.956 --> 20:14.457
which basically prevented
us from getting murdered.

20:14.525 --> 20:17.760
I hated her when she plucked us out
of abject poverty and let us come

20:17.828 --> 20:19.529
to her medical school,
no questions asked,

20:19.597 --> 20:23.299
when then led us to fulfilling our
lifelong dream of becoming TV doctors...

20:23.367 --> 20:24.767
I mean, the list goes on.

20:25.936 --> 20:28.318
I'm crushed with jealousy.

20:28.451 --> 20:32.928
I mean, jealousy has pinned me down and
is sitting on my chest and farting.

20:33.577 --> 20:35.311
So what are you gonna do?

20:42.186 --> 20:45.188
This is a pipin' hot
pumpkin spice latte.

20:45.256 --> 20:48.925
Once Munsch's head is sawed
open and her brain is exposed,

20:48.993 --> 20:51.327
I'm gonna throw this pumpkin spice latte

20:51.395 --> 20:53.196
into her open brain.

20:53.264 --> 20:54.631
What, what?

20:54.698 --> 20:56.266
I'm gonna throw this latte
into her open brain.

20:56.333 --> 20:57.767
I heard you, but why?

20:57.835 --> 20:58.668
It'll kill her!

20:58.736 --> 20:59.435
Will it?

21:00.871 --> 21:01.938
Of course it will.

21:02.006 --> 21:03.339
Um, I'm not...

21:03.407 --> 21:04.807
I'm not sure that it will.

21:04.875 --> 21:07.110
I mean, it might scald a
layer of brain tissue,

21:07.177 --> 21:08.511
but I don't think it'll
leave any lasting damage.

21:08.579 --> 21:10.013
Plus, she won't even feel it.

21:11.081 --> 21:12.181
So it'll maybe scald,

21:12.249 --> 21:13.983
like, a tiny little section of her brain

21:14.051 --> 21:15.018
and then it'll heal right away.

21:18.522 --> 21:19.856
Are you kidding me, Number Five?

21:19.923 --> 21:22.358
It's not "doing someone a favor"

21:22.426 --> 21:24.661
to pour really scalding, super-delicious

21:24.728 --> 21:27.163
pumpkin spice latte
into their open brain.

21:27.231 --> 21:30.700
It is, if it's actually scalding.

21:30.768 --> 21:33.169
Just the fact that it's scalding means

21:33.237 --> 21:34.437
that any bacteria

21:34.505 --> 21:35.905
would be killed instantly.

21:35.973 --> 21:37.707
What you should do is get one

21:37.775 --> 21:39.275
at room temperature and leave it out

21:39.343 --> 21:41.044
for a couple of days until it spoils,

21:41.111 --> 21:42.245
and then pour it on her open brain.

21:42.313 --> 21:44.047
Okay, well, the surgery is happening

21:44.114 --> 21:45.448
right now, Number Five, so
we don't have three days.

21:45.516 --> 21:47.784
And since when did you become so smart?

21:47.851 --> 21:50.019
Since I aced the MCATs with no help.

21:50.087 --> 21:51.587
Ugh, this again.

21:51.655 --> 21:54.290
We all aced the MCATs, Number Five.

21:54.358 --> 21:56.025
I just don't know why
you have to kill her.

21:56.093 --> 21:57.827
I mean, she's gonna die soon anyway.

21:57.895 --> 21:59.495
I don't want her to die.

21:59.563 --> 22:01.497
I want her to be killed by me.

22:01.565 --> 22:04.233
That's why I am gonna pretend to trip,

22:04.301 --> 22:06.669
and pour this piping-hot
PSL into her open brain.

22:06.737 --> 22:09.238
End of conversation. Deal with it.
It's happening!

22:11.909 --> 22:14.043
I'm not gonna... I don't even care.

22:14.111 --> 22:15.811
She's not listening.

22:16.655 --> 22:17.655
Dean Munsch.

22:18.609 --> 22:19.898
Dean Munsch.

22:19.984 --> 22:20.757
Hm?

22:21.460 --> 22:23.794
I've sawed open a
small section of your skull.

22:23.819 --> 22:26.054
Dr. Holt's starting the
procedure right now.

22:26.122 --> 22:27.389
Can you hear me?

22:27.456 --> 22:29.291
Wha-What am I on?

22:29.358 --> 22:30.792
We performed a nerve block

22:30.860 --> 22:33.094
in your neck so you won't feel any pain,

22:33.162 --> 22:35.096
and I've given you a
mild dose of clonazepam

22:35.164 --> 22:36.831
- to keep you calm.
- Mmm.

22:36.899 --> 22:38.133
Calm?

22:38.200 --> 22:40.268
Okay. I feel great.

22:40.336 --> 22:42.938
I mean, you opened up my brain

22:43.005 --> 22:44.739
and exposed it to the world.

22:46.342 --> 22:48.109
But you know,

22:48.177 --> 22:50.912
- party on, whatever.
- All right, now...

22:50.980 --> 22:53.515
What I'm gonna do is
insert this biopsy needle

22:53.582 --> 22:54.950
in through a section of the frontal lobe

22:55.017 --> 22:56.718
that processes music.

22:56.786 --> 22:58.887
So I'd like you to sing a
song for us, if you can.

22:58.955 --> 22:59.921
Is there a song that you like?

22:59.989 --> 23:02.123
Yeah, "Smoke on the Water."

23:02.191 --> 23:03.792
Deep Purple, "Smoke on the Water."

23:03.859 --> 23:05.794
- Seriously?
- Well, yeah.

23:05.861 --> 23:09.831
I mean, they're like the
granddaddies of heavy metal.

23:09.899 --> 23:11.900
Have you never heard
that chord progression?

23:11.968 --> 23:14.602

I'm sorry, I tripped.

24:16.699 --> 24:18.900
- No, you didn't.
- I-I didn't do anything.

24:18.968 --> 24:20.402
- No, get out!
- I'm just a patsy.

24:20.469 --> 24:21.836
Okay, let's sew her back up.

24:21.904 --> 24:23.705
Five, let's get this sample
down to the lab, please.

24:23.773 --> 24:25.840
Cassidy, close up the hole.

24:25.908 --> 24:27.842
Okay, well, honey,

24:27.910 --> 24:29.177
the procedure went perfectly,

24:29.245 --> 24:31.212
except for Chanel throwing a latte.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.313
We're gonna stitch you
up, and you're gonna be

24:32.381 --> 24:33.481
as good as new.

24:33.549 --> 24:35.216
Mmm. Boning soon?

24:35.284 --> 24:36.384
That's right, sweetheart.

24:36.452 --> 24:38.219
- Boning soon.
- Excellent.

24:41.624 --> 24:44.444
Dean Munsch, I have some good news.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.046
I also have some bad news.

24:47.311 --> 24:49.145
We found no evidence of Kuru.

24:49.213 --> 24:51.281
- Oh!
- What?

24:51.348 --> 24:53.549
- Wonderful!
- But the good news is...

24:53.617 --> 24:56.019
- Wait, that's not the good news?
- That's the bad news.

24:56.086 --> 24:57.987
That means that the
test was inconclusive.

24:58.180 --> 25:00.148
And that means that
it's still very likely

25:00.215 --> 25:01.249
that you could have Kuru.

25:01.316 --> 25:03.985
So what's the good news?

25:04.052 --> 25:07.422
The good news is that

25:07.489 --> 25:08.923
you'll probably still die.

25:08.991 --> 25:11.459
And you've been preparing for that.

25:11.527 --> 25:13.995
So no further preparations are needed,

25:14.062 --> 25:16.397
and, um, you can just, uh,
keep doing what you're doing.

25:16.465 --> 25:18.232
You have terrible bedside manner.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.301
Well, there's also interesting news.

25:20.369 --> 25:22.403
I looked up other things that
could cause the symptoms

25:22.471 --> 25:23.738
we all think is Kuru

25:23.806 --> 25:25.072
and the only thing that could be causing

25:25.140 --> 25:26.307
all of those symptoms...

25:26.375 --> 25:27.708
dehydration.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.744
- What?
- Extreme dehydration.

25:29.812 --> 25:31.879
Like, you would have had to
not have water for years.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.748
That's insane. I drink water.

25:33.816 --> 25:35.883
I mean, I'm constantly drinking.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.819
I-I...

25:37.886 --> 25:40.321
Oh, my God.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.791
I only drink scotch.

25:43.859 --> 25:45.293
Or vodka.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.195
Wait, wait, wait, wait. That
doesn't make any sense.

25:47.262 --> 25:48.563
You put water in it, don't you?

25:48.630 --> 25:49.997
Or drink it on the rocks?

25:50.065 --> 25:52.033
No. Straight up. Neat.

25:52.100 --> 25:54.001
Okay, but you'd have to
have a little bit of water.

25:54.069 --> 25:56.237
I mean, you brush your teeth,

25:56.305 --> 25:57.538
and you rinse with...

25:57.606 --> 25:59.407
Scotch.

26:06.114 --> 26:08.583
Okay, um, what about at a restaurant?

26:08.650 --> 26:10.818
Would you like still or sparkling?

26:10.886 --> 26:14.388
Actually, I'd love two
fingers of scotch, neat.

26:14.456 --> 26:15.990
Thank you.

26:16.058 --> 26:20.027
I'm sorry, so you think I am
just extremely dehydrated?

26:21.630 --> 26:24.699
But what about the fact
that I ate <i>brains?</i>

26:24.766 --> 26:28.269
Hello, Swando? It's Cathy Munsch.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.438
Do you remember me? We met on a plane.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.974
Cathy, hi. It's been a while.

26:33.041 --> 26:34.542
Yes, hello, Swando.

26:34.618 --> 26:38.053
Um, do you remember that
party that you took me to?

26:38.113 --> 26:40.781
That was for one of your
relatives, am I correct?

26:40.849 --> 26:43.951
Yes, that is right. Very sad.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.420
And we ate brains?

26:46.488 --> 26:48.155
Yes, that is right.

26:48.223 --> 26:49.891
It's a family tradition.

26:52.252 --> 26:54.620
I have Kuru.

26:56.498 --> 26:59.300
- Oh, Cathy, that's very sad.
- There, there. There, there.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.469
We are heartbroken, too.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.371
Grandpa was a dear member of the family.

27:03.438 --> 27:04.805
And so was Lamby.

27:04.873 --> 27:07.074
Wait, wait, who's Lamby?

27:07.142 --> 27:10.278
Lamby. He was our pet lamb.
He died, too.

27:10.345 --> 27:12.246
It's a family tradition
that when a pet lamb dies,

27:12.314 --> 27:13.581
we eat the brains.

27:13.649 --> 27:17.818
Wait, are you saying
that I ate lamb brains

27:17.886 --> 27:19.220
and not <i>human</i> brains?

27:19.288 --> 27:21.322
Of course we don't eat human brains,

27:21.390 --> 27:22.823
you xenophobic piece of garbage.

27:22.891 --> 27:26.761
I don't have Kuru!

27:26.828 --> 27:28.629
I'm dehydrated.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.615
I'm gonna be fine.

27:30.699 --> 27:33.501
Oh! Oh...

27:33.569 --> 27:36.304
Hey, everybody, Nurse
Hoffel wants us all

27:36.371 --> 27:37.471
to go down to the basement

27:37.539 --> 27:39.273
for a champagne toast

27:39.341 --> 27:41.275
to celebrate the good news.

27:41.343 --> 27:43.511
How does she know? Oh, come on.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.046
I need some water.

27:45.113 --> 27:46.714
Welcome, everyone.

27:46.782 --> 27:48.716
Please go inside.

27:48.784 --> 27:50.751
Oh, champagne and cheese!

27:50.819 --> 27:52.286
And a honeymoon bed.

27:52.354 --> 27:54.455
Sweetheart, boning soon!

27:55.557 --> 27:57.525
Hold on a second.

27:57.593 --> 28:00.661
This isn't real champagne.
This is sparkling apple cider!

28:00.729 --> 28:02.930
And this cheese is Styrofoam.

28:02.998 --> 28:05.666
I just wanted to make
sure your last meal was

28:05.734 --> 28:08.302
as awful as possible.

28:08.370 --> 28:10.171
Wait.

28:10.238 --> 28:11.439
You're the Green Meanie?

28:11.506 --> 28:13.708
Well, I was not expecting <i>that.</i>

28:13.775 --> 28:16.110
Well, Hester, you could have given...

28:16.178 --> 28:18.012
- Where's Hester?
- I saw her get in an Uber

28:18.080 --> 28:19.814
with her suitcases a
couple of hours ago.

28:19.881 --> 28:21.549
Pretty sure she was running away.

28:21.617 --> 28:24.185
- Not sure why it took her so long.
- This makes no sense.

28:24.252 --> 28:26.287
She's way to old to be
the baby in the belly.

28:26.355 --> 28:28.155
That didn't stop you guys accusing me.

28:28.223 --> 28:31.659
Dr. Cassidy is the baby in the belly,

28:31.727 --> 28:33.494
and the other Green Meanie.

28:33.562 --> 28:35.329
He totally hasn't killed someone
in, like, three days, so...

28:36.398 --> 28:38.099
What does any of this have to do

28:38.166 --> 28:39.166
with Nurse Awful?!

28:39.234 --> 28:40.701
Because my real name isn't "Hoffel,"

28:40.769 --> 28:43.004
you evil little trollop.

28:43.071 --> 28:44.271
It's Bean!

28:47.009 --> 28:48.709
Sort of rings a bell?

28:48.777 --> 28:51.946
Oh, for the love of Pete! Agatha Bean?

28:52.014 --> 28:53.781
Can you give us a couple more clues?

28:53.849 --> 28:54.949
She was your maid!

28:57.219 --> 29:00.021
You burned poor Agatha's
face in the deep fryer.

29:00.088 --> 29:02.023
Oh...

29:02.090 --> 29:04.425
She was my sister, and you killed her.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.862
And you let them get away
with it, Dean Munsch.

29:07.929 --> 29:10.665
- I am sooo sorry about that.
- Can I just say...

29:10.732 --> 29:12.667
I feel like I'm unfairly
being, you know,

29:12.734 --> 29:14.669
lumped in with this group here.

29:14.736 --> 29:16.270
Collateral damage.

29:16.338 --> 29:17.672
Today they pay for what they did

29:17.739 --> 29:20.574
to sweet Agatha.

29:20.642 --> 29:23.744
And Cassidy will take
the fall for all of it.

29:23.812 --> 29:26.247
Not so fast!

29:26.314 --> 29:27.248
Mom?

29:27.315 --> 29:28.683
Zayday, you're safe!

29:28.750 --> 29:31.252
Oh, I'm so relieved.

29:31.319 --> 29:32.887
Yeah, thank you guys for
all your tireless efforts

29:32.954 --> 29:34.355
in trying to find me.

29:34.423 --> 29:36.891
I was trapped in a well again.

29:36.958 --> 29:39.293
This ends now, Nurse Hoffel.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.462
Since seeing this hospital,

29:41.530 --> 29:46.300
and the way it loves, respects,
and heals its patients,

29:46.368 --> 29:50.438
it's made me realize how wrong
I was to hold onto my anger.

29:50.505 --> 29:53.441
The past is the past.

29:53.508 --> 29:55.242
I'm reborn!

30:00.182 --> 30:03.017
Put her in the cage!

30:03.085 --> 30:05.019
- Move it! Move it!
- Come on, move it.

30:06.188 --> 30:09.490
No, no! Aww.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.992
Mom.

30:14.129 --> 30:15.730
I'm so
sorry I let you down.

30:15.797 --> 30:20.735
No. No, you didn't.

30:20.802 --> 30:24.638
You saved me.

30:26.041 --> 30:28.709
You and Zayday Williams.

30:30.612 --> 30:32.379
Ms. Hollis, I'm so sorry

30:32.447 --> 30:34.915
about everything that's happened
to you and your family.

30:34.983 --> 30:38.252
And if we make it through this,

30:38.320 --> 30:40.421
I promise this hospital will make amends

30:40.489 --> 30:43.357
by caring for and curing as
many people as possible.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.293
Your father.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.999
He would be so proud.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.347
I'm gonna kill you.

31:06.414 --> 31:08.315
Well, that's gonna be a little difficult

31:08.383 --> 31:10.584
when you're splattered
into a million pieces

31:10.652 --> 31:12.720
all over the neighborhood.

31:18.527 --> 31:21.362
This is a bigger bomb than Cloud Atlas!

31:23.165 --> 31:25.032
Congratulations, Cassidy.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.768
I think your mommy's
about to get her wish.

31:27.836 --> 31:29.770
The only regret I have

31:29.838 --> 31:34.408
is that I don't get to see your face

31:34.476 --> 31:37.778
when you finally die, Chanel.

31:37.846 --> 31:41.415
Good-bye, Chanels. Have fun in hell.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.150
Oh, by the way, I heard

31:43.218 --> 31:45.052
there are no dinosaurs!

31:45.120 --> 31:47.421
Oh, no.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.458
Oh. Okay.

31:51.526 --> 31:53.427
I guess we should

31:53.495 --> 31:54.862
take this moment,

31:54.930 --> 31:58.098
perhaps, to let go of some old grudges.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.434
Screw that, I am going out

32:00.502 --> 32:01.535
guns blazing!

32:01.603 --> 32:02.803
Wait! Wait a minute!

32:02.871 --> 32:05.239
- Wha... Denise!
- What?

32:05.307 --> 32:09.043
You're alive, that
means my cryo-chamber worked!

32:09.110 --> 32:10.978
Damn right it did, crunchy Munsch.

32:11.046 --> 32:13.981
The low temperature allowed my
heart to beat slowly enough

32:14.049 --> 32:15.382
to regain its strength or something.

32:15.450 --> 32:16.650
Anyway,

32:16.718 --> 32:18.986
I'm back, bitches! All right.

32:19.054 --> 32:20.421
What did I miss?

32:20.488 --> 32:22.423
Ooh! How's Hillary working out?

32:22.490 --> 32:24.992
I mean, the first female president,

32:25.060 --> 32:26.493
and I missed the moment!

32:26.561 --> 32:28.929
- Damn it!
- Can you just stop talking

32:28.997 --> 32:30.264
and defuse the bomb?

32:33.335 --> 32:35.302
Damn, that look complicated.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.439
They didn't show us how to
defuse no bombs in Quantico.

32:38.506 --> 32:40.107
But, but, but, but, but

32:40.175 --> 32:42.109
fortunate for all of us,

32:42.177 --> 32:44.845
I did watch the hit TV show <i>Quantico.</i>

32:44.913 --> 32:48.849
And I saw Agent Alex Parrish defuse one.

32:48.917 --> 32:50.251
All right.

32:50.318 --> 32:54.588
If my memory serves me correctly...

32:54.656 --> 32:56.991
Damn, I don't have my glasses.
Okay, but I think

32:57.058 --> 33:01.762
if I pull that wire, either...

33:01.830 --> 33:03.864
the countdown will stop,

33:03.932 --> 33:06.367
or we'll all be blown to smithereens.

33:10.205 --> 33:13.440
Ain't but one damn way to find out.

33:13.508 --> 33:15.276
I do have teeth in my vagina!

33:15.343 --> 33:17.044
I knew it.

33:17.112 --> 33:20.714
I didn't want to die a liar.

33:20.782 --> 33:22.783
They are very sharp.

33:22.851 --> 33:24.451
And I don't know how they got there.

33:24.519 --> 33:26.020
Shut up!

33:35.931 --> 33:37.765
Oh!

33:37.832 --> 33:39.099
Yes!

33:39.167 --> 33:40.901
Oh, Denise!

33:41.250 --> 33:43.050
Denise Hemphill.

33:43.335 --> 33:44.602
Ha!

33:49.678 --> 33:50.945
Let's get her!

34:31.686 --> 34:33.286
Oh, God.

34:38.326 --> 34:40.661
You sacrificed yourself for me.

34:42.864 --> 34:44.898
You know, pal, could've just
pushed her out of the way

34:44.966 --> 34:46.433
to save her life.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.469
Yeah.

34:48.536 --> 34:51.338
Jumping in front of a machete
is, like, option number three

34:51.406 --> 34:54.007
in terms of the ways you
could've kept Chanel #3 alive.

34:54.074 --> 34:55.342
Shut up.

34:55.409 --> 34:58.078
This was his redemption.

34:58.146 --> 34:59.380
Now he can be forgiven

34:59.447 --> 35:01.615
for killing all those people.

35:01.683 --> 35:03.083
Uh, I don't think it works that way.

35:03.151 --> 35:04.852
Shut up!

35:06.855 --> 35:08.422
He's trying to speak.

35:08.490 --> 35:10.391
Now that you're dying,

35:10.458 --> 35:12.893
do you believe that you
were always alive?

35:12.961 --> 35:15.729
I knew I was alive...

35:15.797 --> 35:18.899
because of how good it felt to love you.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.136
Uh, say what now?

35:22.203 --> 35:23.470
She's getting away. Go!

35:31.513 --> 35:33.280
There she is!

35:35.050 --> 35:36.417
She getting away!

35:40.422 --> 35:42.589
Oh! Careful, quicksand.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.129
Somebody! Drop me a rope!

35:50.999 --> 35:54.501
Come on! This is a horrible way to die.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.236
Look, in my experience,

35:56.304 --> 35:57.438
costumed serial killers

35:57.505 --> 35:59.273
are never adequately
punished by the law.

35:59.340 --> 36:01.508
Sometimes vigilante
justice is the only way.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.510
I'm with Chanel. She
killed my boyfriend.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.180
Oh, so I suppose no one cares

36:06.247 --> 36:07.514
that your boyfriend
murdered my boyfriend?!

36:07.582 --> 36:09.283
No! No one does.

36:09.350 --> 36:12.368
All right. We'll take a vote.

36:12.393 --> 36:15.248
All in favor of saving Nurse
Hoffel, raise your hand.

36:17.763 --> 36:21.566
All in favor of a terrible
swamp death, raise your hand.

36:21.591 --> 36:22.858
Boom.

36:25.366 --> 36:27.134
I... Oh...

36:34.776 --> 36:37.544
Oh! Damn my conscience!

36:38.646 --> 36:40.714
Here.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.349
- Here.
- What...

36:42.417 --> 36:44.384
Okay, hold on!

36:44.452 --> 36:45.419
Help me. Hold...

36:45.487 --> 36:46.353
Wait, wait. Okay.

36:46.421 --> 36:47.754
- Hold on. Oh...
- Oh!

37:15.850 --> 37:18.544
<i>And just like that, another
group of crazy serial killers</i>

37:18.569 --> 37:20.303
<i>failed in their mission to destroy me.</i>

37:20.371 --> 37:23.073
No! No! No! No!

37:23.140 --> 37:26.076
<i>I know the last girl
standing in these things is usually</i>

37:26.143 --> 37:28.111
<i>some sweet, virginal heroine.
But in my experience,</i>

37:28.179 --> 37:31.047
<i>survival is all about being
skinny, pretty, fashionable</i>

37:31.115 --> 37:33.583
<i>and ruthless. I don't know
why those things matter,</i>

37:33.651 --> 37:35.585
<i>but that's who I am and I'm still alive.</i>

37:35.653 --> 37:37.854
<i>So, ipso facto, that must be why.</i>

37:40.491 --> 37:42.258
<i>Not being terrorized by a serial killer</i>

37:42.326 --> 37:45.962
<i>did wonders for the hospital.</i>

37:46.030 --> 37:47.630
<i>Which made Chanel #5 supes happy.</i>

37:47.698 --> 37:50.033
Now, I know all the doctors
you've seen up to this point

37:50.101 --> 37:52.736
think you have MS, but looking
at your family history,

37:52.803 --> 37:54.904
I think it's possible you could
have a hidden vascular issue,

37:54.972 --> 37:57.073
so I'm gonna order an MRI.

37:57.141 --> 37:59.009
<i>Turns out she's
some kind of idiot savant</i>

37:59.076 --> 38:00.543
<i>when it comes to medical stuf.</i>

38:00.611 --> 38:03.013
<i>She's still intolerable
and single, obvi,</i>

38:03.080 --> 38:04.447
<i>but at least she's doing
some good in the world.</i>

38:04.515 --> 38:05.882
<i>And now that Brock and Dean Munsch</i>

38:05.950 --> 38:07.050
<i>left the hospital, she and Zayday</i>

38:07.118 --> 38:08.785
<i>are kind of top dogs there.</i>

38:08.853 --> 38:10.787
If we form an alliance with St.
Mary's Hospital

38:10.855 --> 38:12.922
and KHF Hospital, we can
coordinate to keep prices low.

38:12.990 --> 38:14.858
It might cut into our
profits, but we're here

38:14.925 --> 38:16.459
to cure people, not make money, right?

38:16.527 --> 38:18.762
Well, okay.

38:18.829 --> 38:21.865
<i>Oh, Dean Munsch and Dr. Hot
didn't leave together, though.</i>

38:21.932 --> 38:24.067
<i>Major drama went down
the day Nurse Hoffel</i>

38:24.135 --> 38:25.735
<i>became the swamp's final victim.</i>

38:25.803 --> 38:27.103
We need to talk.

38:27.171 --> 38:30.306
Mm. Oh, my beautiful husband.

38:30.374 --> 38:33.009
I feel like I have been given
the greatest second chance

38:33.077 --> 38:36.279
since they cast Mickey
Rourke in <i>The Wrestler.</i>

38:36.347 --> 38:38.681
Now you get to watch me
grow old and I get to see

38:38.749 --> 38:40.950
if you'll actually grow old
or if you're a vampire

38:41.018 --> 38:43.119
who never ages, like everyone says.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.254
Does everybody really say that?

38:44.321 --> 38:45.955
Yeah. But...

38:46.023 --> 38:48.758
it doesn't matter, because what matters

38:48.826 --> 38:52.529
is that this hospital gets
to be what it claims to be:

38:52.596 --> 38:55.465
a place where the incurable are cured.

38:55.533 --> 38:56.933
I'll have no problem

38:57.001 --> 38:58.735
finding somebody to
take it off my hands.

38:58.803 --> 39:01.971
Well, yeah, that's a good idea.
You should travel the world

39:02.039 --> 39:04.107
or whatever, and I will stay here

39:04.175 --> 39:05.842
and I will hold down the fort for you,

39:05.910 --> 39:07.343
and I will miss you, my darling.

39:07.411 --> 39:11.147
Don't be
silly, hubby o' mine.

39:11.215 --> 39:14.084
You see, I am going
to the bank right now

39:14.151 --> 39:15.952
and I'm pulling out all my money.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.021
Then you and I are going to buy

39:18.089 --> 39:20.256
a chalet in Aspen,

39:20.324 --> 39:23.093
and I am gonna hang out a shingle

39:23.160 --> 39:26.429
and become the premier sex
therapist for women over 50

39:26.497 --> 39:28.765
and you, my love,

39:28.833 --> 39:30.867
are gonna be the orthopedic surgeon

39:30.935 --> 39:33.002
to the stars.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.037
Love you.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.039
Love you.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.008
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

39:39.076 --> 39:40.844
This is rather awkward, but...

39:40.911 --> 39:43.046
your accounts are empty, Dean Munsch.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.047
Excuse me?

39:44.115 --> 39:45.815
You came in earlier today

39:45.883 --> 39:48.551
- and withdrew all of your funds.
- What?!

39:52.456 --> 39:54.023
It's not a great picture.

39:58.662 --> 40:02.098
<i>Yup, Hester stole
all of Dean Munsch's money.</i>

40:02.166 --> 40:05.502
<i>And her man. Though no one
knows where they ran off to.</i>

40:08.506 --> 40:11.941
Will you be having lunch
now, sir, or later?

40:12.009 --> 40:14.110
I don't know. What do
you think, sweetie?

40:14.178 --> 40:16.112
Have the guests arrived?

40:16.180 --> 40:18.581
Their boat hit the reef
about half an hour ago.

40:18.649 --> 40:22.051
The strongest ones should be
swimming ashore at any moment.

40:24.655 --> 40:28.124
Let's eat now and give 'em a
chance to get their energy back.

40:28.192 --> 40:29.893
Thank you, sir. It's no fun

40:29.960 --> 40:31.294
hunting them when they're all worn out.

40:31.362 --> 40:32.929
Ugh. I agree.

40:32.997 --> 40:35.465
It's like we have the same brain.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.772
Dean Munsch didn't take long
to <i>get back on her feet, though.</i>

40:42.840 --> 40:45.141
<i>She sold the hospital for a
fortune and went to Aspen</i>

40:45.209 --> 40:47.310
<i>to help old ladies remember
how to have orgasms again.</i>

40:49.113 --> 40:51.114
Meredith. Come on in.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.249
<i>She's also boning half the U.S.
Ski Team.</i>

40:53.317 --> 40:56.119
<i>And as for me,
well, destiny called...</i>

40:56.187 --> 40:58.488
<i>well, destiny DM'd me, because it's 2016</i>

40:58.556 --> 41:00.056
<i>and no one actually calls anymore.</i>

41:02.393 --> 41:04.327
It's <i>Lovin' the C,</i>

41:04.395 --> 41:07.330
with your host, Dr. Chanel Oberlin!

41:10.334 --> 41:13.503
<i>Yup, I'm a TV doctor, just
like I said I would be.</i>

41:13.571 --> 41:15.305
<i>Because I get what I deserve,</i>

41:15.372 --> 41:19.008
<i>and I deserve everything I get.</i>

41:19.076 --> 41:21.010
<i>Chanel #3 is my Gayle King.</i>

41:21.078 --> 41:23.947
<i>She executive produces the
show, whatever that means.</i>

41:24.014 --> 41:27.483
Hi, everybody, and
welcome to <i>Lovin' the C.</i>

41:27.551 --> 41:29.953
I'm the C, Dr. Chanel Oberlin,

41:30.020 --> 41:32.956
and today on the show we'll
be discussing death panels.

41:33.023 --> 41:34.958
How can we make them a real thing

41:35.025 --> 41:37.961
for rich people who want
their inheritances sooner?

41:39.964 --> 41:42.298
If I may be obliged

41:42.366 --> 41:44.367
a personal moment...

41:44.435 --> 41:47.136
I've learned a lot in
the past few years,

41:47.204 --> 41:49.172
and most importantly of all,

41:49.240 --> 41:52.542
I've learned that you
just have to be yourself.

41:52.610 --> 41:55.712
And that consequences and responsibility

41:55.779 --> 41:59.349
are burdens for people who
choose to feel shame.

41:59.416 --> 42:01.618
So, you be you, America.

42:01.685 --> 42:05.021
Because Chanel Oberlin
is gonna keep being me.
