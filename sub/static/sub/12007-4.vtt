00:00.006 --> 00:01.773
Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:01.807 --> 00:04.618
This is 90 minutes for chemistry

00:04.619 --> 00:07.211
and coming late, takes away
from the other students.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.075
_

00:10.288 --> 00:13.824
I broke Tank's heart,
and he is this great guy,

00:13.858 --> 00:15.525
but I love Emmett.

00:15.689 --> 00:16.689
Can we go back to being friends?

00:16.724 --> 00:17.724
I would love that.

00:17.758 --> 00:19.659
A movie version of your
book could still happen.

00:19.693 --> 00:20.315
Yeah, right.

00:20.494 --> 00:22.195
Take it to Broadway, they
could make a musical out of it.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.064
Right over here. This is perfect.

00:24.098 --> 00:25.999
I kept seeing dance numbers in my head.

00:26.033 --> 00:27.801
You should go to USC.

00:27.835 --> 00:30.036
I know that it's far away,

00:30.071 --> 00:31.905
but you have to go.

00:31.939 --> 00:33.940
I will come as soon as I can.

00:33.975 --> 00:34.908
How's Emmett?

00:34.942 --> 00:36.710
If he could make some friends,

00:36.744 --> 00:38.545
then he'll be okay. But until then

00:38.579 --> 00:39.813
I have to make him believe

00:39.847 --> 00:42.415
that it's not a big deal we're
so far away from each other.

00:46.574 --> 00:51.244
I have been fantasizing
about this moment for months.

00:52.095 --> 00:55.295
_

00:57.096 --> 00:58.758
_

00:58.759 --> 01:01.577
Yeah, except I'm a convicted felon

01:01.578 --> 01:03.946
and I don't talk to birds.

01:04.346 --> 01:06.457
_

01:06.483 --> 01:08.317
Daphne's dorm is having a party.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.318
_

01:09.519 --> 01:12.254
Tonight I might even go for a jog

01:12.289 --> 01:14.156
around the neighborhood just for fun.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.157
_

01:16.192 --> 01:17.293
No.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.260
Oh!

01:19.296 --> 01:20.996
Fifteen seconds to midnight.

01:21.031 --> 01:22.197
Fifteen.

01:22.232 --> 01:23.332
Fourteen.

01:25.236 --> 01:27.136
That's weird. Someone's here, hold on.

01:35.579 --> 01:36.712
Oh my God!

01:38.815 --> 01:39.749
Wh...

01:39.783 --> 01:41.350
but how... wh...

01:42.551 --> 01:45.131
_

01:45.689 --> 01:47.256
This is...

01:47.371 --> 01:48.504
thank you.

01:49.506 --> 01:50.639
Oh, it's time.

01:50.674 --> 01:52.375
It's time! It's time!

02:32.814 --> 02:34.581
Five more minutes?

02:34.682 --> 02:36.963
_

02:36.964 --> 02:40.939
_

02:40.940 --> 02:42.668
_

02:42.691 --> 02:43.657
That's a good point.

02:47.115 --> 02:50.017
Can you seriously only stay for two days?

02:50.758 --> 02:52.520
_

02:54.056 --> 02:55.323
Absolutely.

02:56.324 --> 03:01.659
_

03:01.660 --> 03:03.919
_

03:04.466 --> 03:06.067
Totally,

03:06.101 --> 03:09.003
but I was kind of looking forward to

03:09.037 --> 03:11.172
being anywhere but inside.

03:11.173 --> 03:13.840
_

03:15.043 --> 03:16.243
I do.

03:16.278 --> 03:18.045
I definitely, definitely do.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.349
Uh, but maybe after we
could go out somewhere.

03:21.383 --> 03:23.184
Oh, we could have, like, a picnic.

03:25.385 --> 03:26.994
_

03:27.155 --> 03:28.989
I mean it doesn't matter what we do.

03:29.024 --> 03:31.258
It's gonna be awesome.

03:33.228 --> 03:36.097
So, text me as soon as you wake up.

03:36.131 --> 03:38.299
We have a lot of missed
time to make up for.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.308
_

04:00.222 --> 04:02.223
Sweet, sweet freedom.

04:10.132 --> 04:12.199
I am so glad the elevator was out.

04:12.234 --> 04:13.968
That thing's huge.

04:14.002 --> 04:15.302
Maybe this one won't
crap out after a month.

04:15.337 --> 04:16.337
Where should I...

04:16.370 --> 04:17.338
just... right there's fine.

04:17.372 --> 04:18.372
Okay.

04:18.406 --> 04:21.108
Sorry, I just have this huge chem exam

04:21.142 --> 04:22.142
in half an hour.

04:22.177 --> 04:23.144
I got it.

04:23.178 --> 04:24.245
I was gonna say hi to Melody anyway.

04:24.279 --> 04:25.312
Great.

04:27.182 --> 04:28.149
Ramen?

04:28.183 --> 04:31.285
Oh, now I know you are studying too hard.

04:31.319 --> 04:33.220
It's just for when I miss dinner.

04:33.255 --> 04:35.423
Yeah, I've never seen you
go at something like this.

04:35.457 --> 04:37.158
It's this professor.

04:37.192 --> 04:38.192
She never praises anybody,

04:38.226 --> 04:40.094
so it makes you work
twice as hard, you know?

04:40.128 --> 04:41.395
She sounds tough.

04:41.430 --> 04:42.430
Oh, she's amazing.

04:42.464 --> 04:46.300
She raised two boys while she got her PhD,

04:46.334 --> 04:48.035
and published all this great research.

04:48.069 --> 04:50.004
She could totally be

04:50.038 --> 04:51.372
at an Ivy League if she wanted,

04:51.406 --> 04:53.007
so we're super lucky.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.408
Impressive.

04:54.443 --> 04:56.076
Plus, she was the only woman

04:56.111 --> 04:58.045
in her graduating class at Caltech,

04:58.079 --> 05:00.047
and she's beautiful.

05:00.081 --> 05:01.215
Not that that's relevant, but...

05:01.249 --> 05:02.216
Hm.

05:03.985 --> 05:05.119
Oh, man!

05:05.153 --> 05:06.220
Let me see.

05:06.254 --> 05:07.354
I love those.

05:07.389 --> 05:09.290
You know what, give them to me.

05:09.324 --> 05:10.424
I'll get them resoled.

05:10.459 --> 05:11.425
Awesome.

05:13.061 --> 05:14.061
Okay.

05:14.095 --> 05:15.296
I got to go. I'll talk to you later.

05:15.330 --> 05:16.363
Understood.

05:20.202 --> 05:22.136
Thanks for everything, mom.

05:26.475 --> 05:28.108
All right, come on.

05:36.950 --> 05:38.200
- _
- _

05:38.701 --> 05:40.069
_

05:40.322 --> 05:41.288
Good.

05:43.389 --> 05:44.389
_

05:44.459 --> 05:46.126
It's a peace sign.

05:46.161 --> 05:47.228
Come on.

05:47.262 --> 05:48.362
Hey, relax.

05:48.396 --> 05:49.363
You got this.

05:49.564 --> 05:54.279
_

05:54.302 --> 05:55.436
Just pretend he's a bucket.

05:55.437 --> 05:57.550
_

05:57.566 --> 05:59.206
Well, you're never gonna know

05:59.241 --> 06:00.307
if you don't try.

06:00.342 --> 06:02.243
Okay, just start slow and easy.

06:02.277 --> 06:04.078
You throw a couple of wild pitches,

06:04.112 --> 06:05.079
it doesn't matter.

06:05.113 --> 06:07.014
You stay focused.

06:07.048 --> 06:09.416
- Hey, Coach Walsh. John Kennish.
- It's a pleasure.

06:09.451 --> 06:11.051
I was lucky enough to see you break

06:11.086 --> 06:12.119
your doubles record in '90.

06:12.153 --> 06:13.153
- Huh.
- Seems like yesterday.

06:13.188 --> 06:14.188
Yeah.

06:14.222 --> 06:16.090
Give or take 20 years.

06:16.124 --> 06:18.092
Anyway, Coach, I want to introduce you to

06:18.126 --> 06:19.293
the next generation.

06:19.327 --> 06:20.394
This is Travis Barnes.

06:20.428 --> 06:23.063
Thank you for letting me try out.

06:23.098 --> 06:24.198
"Thank you for letting me try out."

06:25.400 --> 06:27.334
John Kennish is willing to
put his reputation on the line,

06:27.369 --> 06:29.069
you must be pretty special.

06:29.104 --> 06:31.972
Uh, he says that if I trust you,

06:32.007 --> 06:33.941
you must be pretty special.

06:34.042 --> 06:35.449
_

06:36.978 --> 06:37.978
Whenever you're ready.

06:38.013 --> 06:38.946
Yeah.

06:40.882 --> 06:42.016
So, how long's he been playing?

06:42.050 --> 06:43.017
Oh, you know, uh...

06:43.051 --> 06:44.952
On and off since little league.

06:46.721 --> 06:48.689
Don't let the deafness throw you, Coach.

06:48.723 --> 06:49.790
If you need to tell him anything,

06:49.824 --> 06:50.824
I can sign for you.

06:50.859 --> 06:51.892
Let's just see what he's got.

06:51.927 --> 06:52.893
Okay.

07:12.447 --> 07:13.514
Come on.

07:13.548 --> 07:15.215
Come on.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.550
Make up your mind.

07:29.064 --> 07:29.997
Oh!

07:35.770 --> 07:37.738
By the way, that was slow and easy.

07:48.131 --> 07:49.264
Okay, people.

07:49.298 --> 07:50.932
Pencils down.

07:50.967 --> 07:55.037
Test booklets and answer
sheets to your left.

07:55.071 --> 07:58.840
Congratulations on
surviving your first exam.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.075
The good news

08:00.109 --> 08:02.077
is that your grades will be posted online

08:02.111 --> 08:03.912
in just a few short hours.

08:03.946 --> 08:05.881
The wonders of technology, huh?

08:05.915 --> 08:09.618
The bad news is that if
history is consistent,

08:09.652 --> 08:11.553
a third of you will fail.

08:12.622 --> 08:13.889
I would strongly encourage

08:13.923 --> 08:16.591
those who do to drop the class.

08:18.428 --> 08:21.396
Not all of you are
destined to become doctors.

08:28.438 --> 08:29.530
So, how'd you do?

08:29.706 --> 08:31.574
Honestly, I think I did really well.

08:31.808 --> 08:33.943
I expected nothing less.

08:40.193 --> 08:45.807
_

08:45.888 --> 08:48.256
That is some pretty sweet homework.

08:49.257 --> 08:52.052
_

08:52.053 --> 08:55.448
_

08:55.452 --> 08:57.319
Uh...  Who's Skye?

08:58.740 --> 09:01.752
_

09:01.753 --> 09:04.949
_

09:05.161 --> 09:06.428
What's a D.P.?

09:06.829 --> 09:09.190
_

09:09.196 --> 09:15.823
_

09:16.136 --> 09:20.086
_

09:20.270 --> 09:23.735
_

09:23.736 --> 09:25.891
_

09:25.892 --> 09:31.683
_

09:32.439 --> 09:34.140
Sounds awesome.

09:36.441 --> 09:37.556
_

09:46.707 --> 09:48.106
_

09:48.107 --> 09:51.800
_

09:52.201 --> 09:54.331
_

09:54.378 --> 09:56.512
You sound really happy.

09:58.413 --> 10:04.195
_

10:04.197 --> 10:08.924
See, I told you that it
was the best thing for you.

10:13.305 --> 10:15.489
_

10:17.234 --> 10:18.868
Yeah.

10:21.104 --> 10:22.671
Good thing.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.941
Oh, please, please, please.

10:25.976 --> 10:27.576
Please, please.

10:28.612 --> 10:30.880
Please, please, please, please, please.

10:30.914 --> 10:33.516
Please, please, please, please, please.

10:35.317 --> 10:36.138
_

10:40.837 --> 10:41.770
VoilÃ !

10:41.805 --> 10:43.572
I come bearing new leather soles.

10:43.607 --> 10:45.441
Of course, the repair guy

10:45.475 --> 10:46.675
told me it was gonna take till next week,

10:46.710 --> 10:47.643
but I sweet-talked him.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.412
Are you okay?

10:50.647 --> 10:52.881
I got a "D" on my chem midterm.

10:53.883 --> 10:55.584
Oh, okay.

10:55.618 --> 10:56.618
So,

10:56.653 --> 10:57.719
you'll do better on the next one.

10:57.844 --> 10:59.611
It doesn't matter.

11:00.647 --> 11:01.613
Now...

11:02.048 --> 11:03.214
now I have this "D."

11:03.249 --> 11:04.916
I'll never recover.

11:04.950 --> 11:06.084
This is bad. This is really bad.

11:06.118 --> 11:07.919
Sweetie, you're overreacting.

11:07.953 --> 11:09.654
It's just one test.

11:09.689 --> 11:11.690
No. It's a huge part of my grade.

11:11.724 --> 11:12.791
I'm not overreacting.

11:12.825 --> 11:13.992
Okay, well then let me help you.

11:14.026 --> 11:15.760
Um... we can do flashcards,

11:15.795 --> 11:17.629
I can quiz you. Whatever you need.

11:17.663 --> 11:18.630
You don't get it.

11:18.664 --> 11:20.498
This isn't eighth grade algebra.

11:21.534 --> 11:22.867
You're being too hard on yourself.

11:22.902 --> 11:24.536
You know what you need?

11:24.570 --> 11:25.603
Something to take your mind off it.

11:25.638 --> 11:27.439
Why don't I take you out to a fancy lunch?

11:27.473 --> 11:28.440
That'll cheer you up.

11:28.474 --> 11:30.408
I don't have time for a fancy lunch.

11:30.493 --> 11:31.726
I have to figure out what to do.

11:31.761 --> 11:34.362
Come on, there's gotta be
something that I can do to help you.

11:35.431 --> 11:36.698
There is, you can leave.

11:36.732 --> 11:38.700
Now, please. I'll call you later.

11:49.816 --> 11:51.716
âª it's a whole new ball game âª

11:51.751 --> 11:54.619
âª nowadays âª

11:54.654 --> 11:57.289
âª so join us on our âª

11:57.323 --> 11:58.690
âª exposÃ©s âª

11:58.780 --> 12:00.481
Hey, mom.

12:00.516 --> 12:02.450
Hey.

12:02.484 --> 12:04.652
Hey, did you pick up those undershirts?

12:04.686 --> 12:07.455
Uh, yeah. I think they're by the back door.

12:07.489 --> 12:09.257
The Ralph Lauren ones, right?

12:09.291 --> 12:10.491
Yeah, extra soft.

12:10.526 --> 12:11.492
Hey, honey,

12:11.527 --> 12:12.527
did you get my e-mail?

12:12.561 --> 12:14.462
My friend Kathleen is
looking for someone to D.J.

12:14.496 --> 12:16.230
For her daughter's bat mitzvah.

12:16.265 --> 12:18.266
Yeah, um... I don't know.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.134
Bat mitzvahs aren't really my thing.

12:20.168 --> 12:22.136
Honey, it's a job.

12:22.170 --> 12:26.007
But, mom, I've worked my ass off all
summer to build a name for myself.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.976
If I want to keep that growing,
I can't spin at kids' parties.

12:29.011 --> 12:31.979
Not even if it's 200
bucks for three hours work?

12:32.014 --> 12:34.983
Not even.

12:36.702 --> 12:39.404
So, how's the musical coming, Hammerstein?

12:40.296 --> 12:41.429
It's coming.

12:41.464 --> 12:42.530
I mean, the lyrics are there.

12:42.565 --> 12:44.232
I'm just pulling lines from the book.

12:44.266 --> 12:46.501
But the music... everything's
just feeling too simple.

12:46.535 --> 12:50.171
I mean, I can read music
but writing it is...

12:50.206 --> 12:51.472
Yeah, totally different skill.

12:52.374 --> 12:53.908
Hey, would you, um...

12:53.943 --> 12:54.909
Just...

12:54.944 --> 12:55.944
could you listen?

12:56.979 --> 12:58.213
Sure, I got a second.

13:00.082 --> 13:02.050
âª it's a whole new ball game âª

13:02.084 --> 13:04.018
âª nowadays âª

13:04.053 --> 13:06.121
âª so join us on our âª

13:06.155 --> 13:07.889
âª exposÃ©s âª

13:07.923 --> 13:11.659
âª of scandals, secrets, sex, and lies âª

13:11.694 --> 13:14.829
âª you won't believe your eyes âª

13:14.864 --> 13:16.764
âª it's a whole new ball game âª

13:16.799 --> 13:19.634
âª nowadays. âª

13:25.741 --> 13:27.141
Sounds like a good start.

13:27.175 --> 13:28.843
Toby.

13:30.379 --> 13:33.248
Okay, um, I would pick
up the pace a little bit.

13:33.282 --> 13:34.449
Maybe try swinging the eighths.

13:34.483 --> 13:36.184
Swinging the eighths.

13:38.187 --> 13:40.054
And, um... I would do it in a minor key.

13:40.089 --> 13:41.055
Minor?

13:41.090 --> 13:42.390
Wouldn't that be a little melancholy?

13:42.424 --> 13:43.358
This'll jazz it up.

13:43.392 --> 13:45.126
Okay.

13:48.931 --> 13:51.933
âª It's a whole new ball game nowadays âª

13:51.967 --> 13:54.202
âª so join us on our exposÃ©s âª

13:54.236 --> 13:57.705
âª the scandals,
secrets, sex, and lies âª

13:57.740 --> 14:00.842
âª you won't believe your eyes âª

14:00.876 --> 14:03.845
âª it's a whole new ball game âª

14:03.879 --> 14:06.581
âª nowadays. âª

14:07.275 --> 14:08.408
See, there you go!

14:09.477 --> 14:11.144
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

14:12.346 --> 14:13.446
Why don't we work on this together?

14:13.481 --> 14:15.248
You could be the composer.

14:16.650 --> 14:17.684
I don't know.

14:17.718 --> 14:19.352
No, honey, it'll be fun to work together

14:19.386 --> 14:21.387
and I would pay you.

14:21.455 --> 14:23.456
I just don't know how much help I'd be.

14:23.491 --> 14:25.225
I don't...

14:25.459 --> 14:27.493
musicals aren't my thing.

14:27.528 --> 14:30.396
Honey, a lot of things
aren't your thing lately.

14:31.565 --> 14:33.232
I'm just being selective.

14:33.267 --> 14:35.134
Keep up the good work.

14:46.805 --> 14:47.595
_

14:48.490 --> 14:50.221
_

14:50.436 --> 14:55.958
_

14:56.240 --> 14:58.670
_

14:59.020 --> 15:00.144
_

15:00.150 --> 15:08.111
- _
- _

15:08.115 --> 15:11.635
_

15:12.135 --> 15:13.250
_

15:13.255 --> 15:17.506
_

15:20.457 --> 15:25.522
_

15:25.697 --> 15:28.120
_

15:29.488 --> 15:32.643
_

15:33.838 --> 15:39.717
_

15:40.588 --> 15:45.499
_

15:46.500 --> 15:51.938
_

15:51.939 --> 15:53.433
_

15:56.788 --> 15:57.955
Josh!

15:57.989 --> 15:59.089
Wait up!

15:59.124 --> 16:01.025
I'm off the clock.

16:01.239 --> 16:03.173
Invoice me.

16:03.208 --> 16:04.308
I need your help.

16:05.442 --> 16:09.950
- What's up? Are you okay?
- I got a "D" in that test.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.334
Seriously?

16:12.869 --> 16:15.428
- You knew that stuff.
- I thought so too.

16:15.638 --> 16:17.406
Look at this.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.375
I did the math.

16:19.409 --> 16:21.443
The test was 30% of my final grade.

16:21.478 --> 16:23.245
So to get above a "C" in the class...

16:23.279 --> 16:25.414
You'd have to ace everything else.

16:25.448 --> 16:27.249
And that's not happening.

16:29.886 --> 16:32.922
A "C" isn't even good enough to
get into a good med school, right?

16:34.057 --> 16:36.626
Do you think I should drop
the class and try to take it

16:36.660 --> 16:38.561
again next semester?

16:39.596 --> 16:41.736
Only you can make that decision.

16:45.636 --> 16:50.539
You guys have been apart for a while and
it's gonna take you some time to readjust.

16:50.773 --> 16:54.576
But there's this pressure for
every moment to be perfect.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.678
And he's got this whole
world out there without me

16:56.712 --> 16:58.446
and he seems to really love it.

16:58.481 --> 16:59.447
Well, that's great.

17:00.650 --> 17:01.583
That's not great?

17:02.659 --> 17:04.560
I want to be happy for him. I do.

17:04.594 --> 17:06.627
I'm the one who convinced him to go,

17:06.663 --> 17:09.464
but he is just so happy without me.

17:09.499 --> 17:10.531
Honey,

17:10.567 --> 17:13.234
he flew halfway across
the country to be with you.

17:13.269 --> 17:14.236
He loves you.

17:15.405 --> 17:17.239
What if he's changing?

17:17.272 --> 17:18.473
Or I'm changing.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.309
Of course he's changing.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.511
He's in college now. It's inevitable.

17:22.595 --> 17:23.529
But...

17:23.563 --> 17:26.131
We have to give them time

17:26.165 --> 17:27.366
and just try to change with them.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.435
Let the relationship evolve.

17:29.469 --> 17:32.037
So you're saying I should
become a film connoisseur.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.907
I'm saying...

17:34.941 --> 17:36.108
try and connect.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.738
_

17:45.601 --> 17:47.152
Hello to you too.

17:47.603 --> 17:50.766
_

17:50.768 --> 17:53.242
Yeah, he's got amazing potential

17:53.177 --> 17:55.577
and his arm is like a rocket.

17:56.878 --> 17:58.541
_

17:59.349 --> 18:00.416
Why not?

18:00.450 --> 18:02.518
He's talented, he's excited about it.

18:03.819 --> 18:06.606
_

18:06.607 --> 18:09.492
_

18:09.495 --> 18:13.654
_

18:15.031 --> 18:17.433
You know, it bugs me
when people bag on sports.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.201
Okay, sports build character.

18:19.236 --> 18:22.304
Sports teach kids how
to strive for excellence.

18:22.339 --> 18:24.006
And also how to handle failure.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.339
_

18:29.739 --> 18:30.850
_

18:30.851 --> 18:33.515
_

18:33.516 --> 18:37.061
_

18:37.062 --> 18:41.290
_

18:42.759 --> 18:44.693
Well, let me tell you something.

18:44.928 --> 18:48.063
Baseball has been very good to me,

18:48.098 --> 18:49.832
thank you very much.

18:49.866 --> 18:55.036
And I don't see why Travis shouldn't be
able to strive for exactly the same thing.

18:55.071 --> 18:56.338
He is that good.

18:57.503 --> 19:01.894
_

19:02.731 --> 19:05.647
Do you think that maybe you're
being a little territorial, here?

19:04.681 --> 19:06.515
Do you have his best interests

19:06.549 --> 19:09.184
in mind or your precious program?

19:10.325 --> 19:12.365
_

19:12.795 --> 19:14.578
_

19:15.406 --> 19:18.226
_

19:23.456 --> 19:25.290
Travis is 19.

19:25.325 --> 19:26.291
Okay.

19:26.326 --> 19:29.261
He is old enough to make up his own mind.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.735
_

19:32.737 --> 19:33.988
Back off.

19:37.069 --> 19:39.503
She acted like I don't give
a rat's ass about education.

19:39.530 --> 19:41.030
That's ridiculous.

19:41.065 --> 19:43.199
I know you have Travis' best
interests at heart, honey.

19:43.234 --> 19:45.201
That kid has got a real shot

19:45.236 --> 19:47.036
and not everyone is so lucky.

19:47.071 --> 19:48.338
You mean, like you were?

19:48.372 --> 19:50.907
Yeah, my high school coach,
he had to jump through hoops

19:50.941 --> 19:52.175
to get me seen by a Royals recruiter.

19:52.209 --> 19:54.144
And if he had not gone the extra mile,

19:54.178 --> 19:56.012
I would not have had a career in baseball.

19:59.183 --> 20:00.250
Oh, come on.

20:00.284 --> 20:02.018
Are you telling me that
you agree with Melody?

20:02.052 --> 20:03.953
You think this is all about me?

20:03.988 --> 20:07.190
I just wonder if maybe it's a
little too important to you, honey.

20:09.493 --> 20:10.593
Wait, is this right?

20:10.627 --> 20:12.395
Are we still paying for
Toby's car insurance?

20:12.429 --> 20:14.597
I've been meaning to
talk to him about that.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.265
Jeez.

20:16.299 --> 20:19.068
That Beemer is not a cheap car.

20:19.102 --> 20:22.104
What other expenses of
his are we still covering?

20:22.139 --> 20:25.241
Well, he's under our health
insurance, our cell plan.

20:25.275 --> 20:27.343
- Ugh!
- I know, it's a lot.

20:27.378 --> 20:30.312
What happened to the kid who used
to make monthly expense spreadsheets

20:30.347 --> 20:32.314
and begged you for a job at the car wash?

20:32.349 --> 20:34.283
That kid was a married man.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.769
You know what, I got him
a job at a bat mitzvah

20:36.803 --> 20:39.173
and I offered to pay him to
help me work on my musical

20:39.175 --> 20:40.287
and he turned both down.

20:40.291 --> 20:43.293
And here, most kids would leap at the
opportunity to work with their mother.

20:43.347 --> 20:44.480
That's not the point.

20:44.515 --> 20:47.250
He just doesn't seem worried
about supporting himself.

20:47.284 --> 20:48.318
I mean, at all.

20:48.352 --> 20:49.485
Kathryn, I hate to break it to you,

20:49.520 --> 20:51.187
but this may be the child that we raised.

20:51.222 --> 20:53.089
We have always provided for him.

20:54.158 --> 20:55.325
I think it's time we cut the strings.

20:56.493 --> 20:58.194
What have you done with my wife?

21:04.421 --> 21:05.454
Professor Marillo?

21:05.489 --> 21:06.422
Yes.

21:06.456 --> 21:07.456
Hi.

21:07.491 --> 21:08.724
Hi, I'm Regina Vasquez.

21:08.759 --> 21:11.494
My daughter Daphne is in your
first year chemistry class.

21:11.528 --> 21:12.595
Oh.

21:12.629 --> 21:15.531
Oh, I'm sorry to be
interrupting your dinner.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.532
No, no. N... um...

21:16.567 --> 21:18.301
What can I do for you?

21:18.635 --> 21:19.802
Um...

21:19.836 --> 21:24.406
Daphne has never gotten a
"D" before in her entire life.

21:24.441 --> 21:27.576
Well, this is college.

21:27.611 --> 21:30.579
"A" students become "C" students
despite their best efforts.

21:30.614 --> 21:34.350
The workload is just much more intense.

21:34.384 --> 21:35.551
Of course, I mean, I know that.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.119
But, um...

21:37.153 --> 21:39.488
Daphne has additional challenges.

21:39.622 --> 21:41.223
She's adjusting to an interpreter.

21:41.358 --> 21:43.159
She's never had one in high school.

21:43.193 --> 21:44.360
And...

21:44.394 --> 21:47.129
I've seen the terms she's
trying to cram into her brain.

21:47.164 --> 21:48.918
I mean, hearing students would have trouble

21:48.920 --> 21:50.070
pronouncing those words.

21:50.104 --> 21:52.872
- Are you playing the deaf card?
- Of course not.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.914
Maybe a little.

21:57.017 --> 21:58.851
She needs time to acclimate.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.219
More than the other students.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.757
Is there any way she
can take that test again?

22:04.791 --> 22:06.925
I do not give retests.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.729
But, in this one case

22:10.764 --> 22:12.964
maybe you can make an exception.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.632
That would set a precedent.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.367
I hope you understand.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.670
Thank you for your time.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.904
Maybe some of the other students come from

22:25.912 --> 22:27.646
generations of doctors,

22:27.680 --> 22:31.884
but Daphne has made
all of this for herself.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.853
This is all her.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.054
She's worth it.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.759
I'm sorry.

22:42.628 --> 22:43.695
Thanks again.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.570
How are the captioning glasses?

22:51.847 --> 22:53.468
_

22:53.470 --> 22:58.113
_

22:58.114 --> 23:00.696
_

23:02.281 --> 23:04.216
Well, don't knock K.C.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.780
This theater is screening classics.

23:06.781 --> 23:10.687
_

23:12.097 --> 23:13.598
So, uh...

23:13.632 --> 23:14.999
Chinatown.

23:15.034 --> 23:17.735
I really loved how they
stayed with his P.O.V.

23:17.770 --> 23:20.805
Film noir is so...

23:20.839 --> 23:23.541
Nihilistic in a good way.

23:24.312 --> 23:28.515
- _
- Look, I'm just trying to...

23:28.517 --> 23:31.562
_

23:32.721 --> 23:34.197
I'm an artist, too. So...

23:34.231 --> 23:36.089
_

23:38.403 --> 23:41.126
- _
- Always.

23:46.077 --> 23:49.378
_

23:49.379 --> 23:53.740
_

23:58.010 --> 23:59.134
Oh, uh... who is that?

24:01.678 --> 24:03.104
_

24:05.105 --> 24:06.510
_

24:08.471 --> 24:10.138
She's not, like, into you?

24:13.909 --> 24:15.643
What is with that face?

24:16.779 --> 24:17.979
Emmett, just tell me.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.995
- _
- What?

24:21.998 --> 24:23.305
_

24:24.102 --> 24:25.480
_

24:25.860 --> 24:28.560
- _
- If it wasn't a big deal,

24:28.563 --> 24:31.625
then why didn't you
tell me when it happened?

24:31.628 --> 24:35.307
- _
- Like what? Like mad?

24:35.310 --> 24:38.707
_

24:46.380 --> 24:47.313
Okay.

24:48.583 --> 24:49.783
We should get going.

24:58.424 --> 25:03.080
_

25:03.085 --> 25:07.598
_

25:07.599 --> 25:11.326
_

25:11.431 --> 25:13.891
Yeah, I don't know.

25:14.770 --> 25:18.330
_

25:18.333 --> 25:21.914
_

25:22.178 --> 25:24.012
Oh, that's cool of him.

25:24.015 --> 25:27.557
_

25:29.530 --> 25:32.191
_

25:32.552 --> 25:34.359
You really want to know?

25:34.360 --> 25:37.450
_

25:38.391 --> 25:40.359
I'm on team Melody.

25:40.393 --> 25:42.327
I don't think you should do it.

25:43.440 --> 25:44.348
_

25:44.730 --> 25:48.266
Most jocks are a bunch
of narcissistic jerks.

25:48.301 --> 25:51.136
And I don't want you to become one too.

25:51.170 --> 25:53.238
I have a bad feeling about it.

25:53.272 --> 25:55.140
I have to say how I feel.

25:55.174 --> 25:56.441
So there it is.

26:03.282 --> 26:04.983
Hey, mom, my phone's messed up.

26:05.017 --> 26:07.052
Did you guys forget to
pay our bill or something?

26:07.086 --> 26:09.287
Well, it's not so much "our bill" anymore,

26:09.322 --> 26:10.956
it's yours.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.070
What?

26:12.104 --> 26:14.072
Your dad and I think it's time you started

26:14.106 --> 26:15.307
paying for your insurance and your phone.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.843
You're not living under
our roof anymore and...

26:17.877 --> 26:19.211
So you just turned off my phone?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.846
We didn't turn it off.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.147
We just discontinued your data plan.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.715
This is absurd.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.116
What is absurd is that you are an adult

26:25.151 --> 26:27.052
in your own apartment and
we still pay for a lot.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.754
I'm doing the best that I can
with what I'm making right now.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.656
Honey, if you are turning down work,

26:31.691 --> 26:33.658
I don't think you're doing
the best that you can.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.027
Is this because I won't
work on your play thing?

26:37.029 --> 26:38.096
It's not my kind of music!

26:38.130 --> 26:40.765
See, what is with that attitude?

26:40.800 --> 26:42.700
Work is work. You have to humble yourself

26:42.735 --> 26:44.135
and take whatever job that you can.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.437
I know that.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.539
Okay, so then why are
you being so selective?

26:47.638 --> 26:49.573
'Cause you know dad and
I will pick up the slack?

26:49.607 --> 26:50.674
Honey, you have to have a plan.

26:50.708 --> 26:53.343
Musicians don't have
traditional trajectories.

26:53.377 --> 26:54.344
I know that.

26:54.378 --> 26:56.546
And I love that you
get to do what you love.

26:56.581 --> 26:58.682
Really? 'Cause it doesn't sound
like you're supporting me at all.

27:04.715 --> 27:06.349
Oh, God, you didn't?

27:06.384 --> 27:08.218
I was trying to help.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.486
What did you even say to her?

27:09.720 --> 27:12.555
I just wanted to make sure she
was aware of the challenges...

27:12.590 --> 27:14.490
You used my deafness?

27:14.525 --> 27:16.626
She needed to know your story.

27:16.660 --> 27:17.627
She knows I'm deaf.

27:17.661 --> 27:20.530
But she probably doesn't know the extent

27:20.564 --> 27:21.564
of the extra challenges you face.

27:21.599 --> 27:24.400
She does. She just hates excuses.

27:26.570 --> 27:28.338
Why didn't you tell me first?

27:28.372 --> 27:30.073
So that I could have talked you out of it.

27:30.107 --> 27:32.375
Parents have a right to communicate
with their kids' teachers.

27:32.409 --> 27:34.043
They're called professors.

27:34.108 --> 27:35.041
Hey!

27:35.075 --> 27:36.689
Mom, I'm not in high school anymore.

27:36.797 --> 27:37.764
This is college.

27:37.798 --> 27:38.798
I know that.

27:38.853 --> 27:41.087
Do you know how humiliated I am?

27:42.156 --> 27:43.957
You made me look like a baby.

27:43.991 --> 27:46.059
An invalid, a disabled whiner.

27:46.093 --> 27:48.862
- All I said was... 
- You never went to college.

27:48.896 --> 27:49.896
So what?

27:49.930 --> 27:51.567
So you don't get it.

27:52.533 --> 27:54.334
I don't care how many diplomas you get,

27:54.368 --> 27:56.336
you are never to speak to me like this.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.370
Never.

27:57.405 --> 27:58.672
You've never been in this world.

27:58.706 --> 28:00.307
You don't know how it works.

28:00.341 --> 28:02.442
Stop right there

28:02.476 --> 28:04.377
before you say something you'll regret.

28:06.514 --> 28:09.149
I do not like the person you're becoming.

28:18.927 --> 28:20.224
_

28:20.225 --> 28:21.055
It's almost 4:00.

28:21.779 --> 28:25.020
I hate this. I can feel
our minutes slipping away.

28:25.021 --> 28:26.021
_

28:27.985 --> 28:30.787
So, do you have an early class tomorrow?

28:30.788 --> 28:35.430
_

28:37.929 --> 28:38.962
With Skye?

28:40.663 --> 28:43.640
_

28:43.741 --> 28:47.249
_

28:47.250 --> 28:49.670
_

28:50.371 --> 28:52.701
_

28:53.502 --> 28:56.916
_

28:58.917 --> 29:01.507
_

29:02.386 --> 29:03.720
Why didn't you tell me?

29:03.721 --> 29:07.029
_

29:07.057 --> 29:10.360
But how are we supposed to stay close

29:10.394 --> 29:12.295
if you're keeping things from me?

29:12.330 --> 29:15.165
I mean, you have to tell
me when things are bad.

29:15.166 --> 29:17.280
_

29:17.284 --> 29:18.728
Yeah, thank God for Skye.

29:21.409 --> 29:22.837
_

29:22.838 --> 29:27.115
_

29:27.118 --> 29:29.045
So is it my fault that she kissed you?

29:29.046 --> 29:31.834
_

29:31.835 --> 29:34.560
_

29:34.561 --> 29:36.019
Okay, it's not about the kiss.

29:36.053 --> 29:37.854
It's not even about her.

29:40.858 --> 29:43.126
It just doesn't feel the same.

29:43.127 --> 29:47.924
_

29:47.929 --> 29:50.967
So, what? You think I'm some
pathetic, loser, criminal?

29:50.968 --> 29:55.060
_

29:55.061 --> 29:57.127
_

29:58.042 --> 29:59.676
I know.

30:00.911 --> 30:02.879
But it's only temporary. I...

30:02.913 --> 30:04.881
I'm still coming to L.A.

30:04.882 --> 30:06.612
_

30:06.651 --> 30:08.885
As soon as I'm finished
with my community service.

30:08.886 --> 30:10.797
_

30:11.589 --> 30:12.589
What?

30:12.590 --> 30:14.771
_

30:14.792 --> 30:16.459
Why would I do that?

30:16.460 --> 30:20.246
_

30:20.251 --> 30:21.531
Are you serious?

30:22.767 --> 30:24.367
Who are you right now?

30:29.238 --> 30:32.951
_

30:32.952 --> 30:36.178
_

30:36.580 --> 30:37.347
W...

30:37.381 --> 30:38.381
Emmett!

30:38.416 --> 30:39.382
W...

30:39.417 --> 30:41.084
where are you going?

30:41.118 --> 30:42.919
Your flight doesn't leave for three hours.

30:44.620 --> 30:50.296
_

31:02.909 --> 31:04.910
I'm sorry about my mom.

31:04.944 --> 31:06.878
For the record, I did not
send her to come talk to you.

31:08.014 --> 31:09.748
I'm glad to hear that.

31:09.782 --> 31:11.917
I'd like to think that
you fight your own battles.

31:14.086 --> 31:15.987
I need you to sign this, please.

31:17.790 --> 31:18.957
This is a drop form.

31:18.991 --> 31:20.692
You're giving up?

31:20.726 --> 31:22.761
I'm facing the facts.

31:22.795 --> 31:24.563
We both know how I did on that test.

31:24.597 --> 31:27.732
You got a "D," but do you know why?

31:27.767 --> 31:30.735
I really knew that
material, or I thought I did.

31:30.770 --> 31:35.507
You lost 30 points by
making one fatal error.

31:35.631 --> 31:38.667
You confused anions and cations.

31:38.701 --> 31:41.670
Anions have a net negative charge.

31:41.704 --> 31:43.738
They have more electrons than protons.

31:43.773 --> 31:46.574
And cations have fewer electrons

31:46.609 --> 31:48.343
which makes them positively charged.

31:48.377 --> 31:49.511
I totally knew that.

31:49.545 --> 31:51.246
By confusing the two,

31:51.280 --> 31:53.315
you got this entire second section wrong.

31:55.484 --> 31:56.618
Now, as I told your mother,

31:56.652 --> 31:58.486
I do not allow retakes.

32:00.489 --> 32:05.306
I do occasionally allow
extra credit assignments.

32:05.393 --> 32:06.161
You do?

32:06.195 --> 32:10.165
2,500 words on the difference
between anions and cations

32:10.199 --> 32:12.334
due on my desk first thing Monday morning.

32:12.368 --> 32:14.369
If you do a good job,

32:14.403 --> 32:17.005
I will raise your "D" to a "C."

32:18.230 --> 32:20.198
Seriously?

32:21.434 --> 32:23.034
Thank you so much.

32:23.069 --> 32:24.069
You're welcome.

32:24.103 --> 32:25.303
And...

32:25.337 --> 32:26.938
Some advice.

32:26.972 --> 32:27.972
You're gonna hit

32:28.007 --> 32:29.340
a lot more roadblocks

32:29.375 --> 32:31.209
on your journey to becoming a doctor.

32:31.243 --> 32:32.877
In the future,

32:32.912 --> 32:35.780
don't be so quick to give up.

32:37.983 --> 32:39.017
That's it.

32:51.610 --> 32:54.361
_

32:55.562 --> 32:57.007
_

32:58.008 --> 33:00.062
_

33:00.063 --> 33:01.810
_

33:02.411 --> 33:05.264
_

33:11.465 --> 33:12.905
_

33:19.486 --> 33:22.519
_

33:22.761 --> 33:24.662
This is what he wants.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.247
_

33:28.467 --> 33:29.667
I, uh...

33:29.702 --> 33:32.337
I came on as assistant coach.

33:33.439 --> 33:35.173
Our little conversation,

33:35.207 --> 33:36.441
you know, got me thinking

33:36.475 --> 33:38.076
about my own life.

33:38.077 --> 33:40.465
_

33:47.206 --> 33:55.523
_

33:56.624 --> 33:59.946
_

34:01.901 --> 34:03.268
Okay.

34:19.051 --> 34:20.851
Oh, whoa.

34:20.886 --> 34:21.886
Sorry.

34:26.091 --> 34:27.992
Hi! Hey.

34:27.927 --> 34:29.219
You look amazing.

34:29.295 --> 34:31.329
I am definitely borrowing those.

34:31.364 --> 34:32.397
Yeah, it's the first time

34:32.431 --> 34:34.132
in months that I've actually

34:34.167 --> 34:36.168
wanted people to look at my feet.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.349
Did Emmett leave?

34:37.382 --> 34:39.117
Yeah, um...

34:39.150 --> 34:40.284
He didn't have a lot of time.

34:40.319 --> 34:41.353
Uh, hey!

34:42.521 --> 34:44.089
Ladies!

34:44.123 --> 34:45.190
What's going on?

34:45.224 --> 34:46.224
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:46.259 --> 34:47.458
My buddy lives in the other wing.

34:47.493 --> 34:50.195
Um, isn't it past your curfew?

34:50.228 --> 34:52.097
My house arrest is up.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.063
Nice!

34:53.099 --> 34:54.331
This calls for a toast.

34:54.367 --> 34:56.333
Either of you care for an adult beverage?

34:56.369 --> 34:58.003
I'm good, thanks.

34:58.037 --> 35:01.106
Ah... is there anything other than beer?

35:01.140 --> 35:03.208
Well, let's find you an apÃ©ritif.

35:03.242 --> 35:04.876
Hmm, a what?

35:04.911 --> 35:07.012
I don't really know what it is, but...

35:12.184 --> 35:13.118
Hey!

35:14.820 --> 35:15.820
Hey, yourself.

35:15.855 --> 35:17.022
So...

35:17.056 --> 35:20.825
Turns out I'm gonna need you
back in chemistry on Monday.

35:20.860 --> 35:22.027
So you're not dropping?

35:23.062 --> 35:24.095
What happened?

35:24.130 --> 35:27.866
Marillo said I could do
an essay for extra credit.

35:27.900 --> 35:30.602
So my weekend is completely shot,

35:30.670 --> 35:32.537
but at least I'll still pass.

35:32.571 --> 35:33.505
Wow.

35:33.539 --> 35:35.573
What exactly did you say to her?

35:36.609 --> 35:37.609
Uh, well...

35:37.643 --> 35:39.511
It's not what I said.

35:39.545 --> 35:41.813
When my mom found out I was dropping,

35:41.847 --> 35:43.648
she went and talked to Marillo.

35:43.683 --> 35:44.649
Oh.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.484
I know, right? I'm in college

35:46.519 --> 35:49.521
and my mommy has to come bail me out.

35:49.555 --> 35:51.256
Consider yourself lucky.

35:51.290 --> 35:53.558
When I told my parents that
I was dropping chemistry,

35:53.592 --> 35:56.227
they acted like I'd canceled

35:56.262 --> 35:58.330
a magazine subscription or something.

35:58.364 --> 36:00.298
Sometimes I wish

36:00.333 --> 36:01.533
that they fought me harder.

36:01.567 --> 36:05.337
What your mom did was pretty cool.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.475
Yeah, I guess it was.

36:12.111 --> 36:13.144
Hey!

36:14.313 --> 36:15.347
Sorry I'm late.

36:15.381 --> 36:17.082
No worries. It was worth the wait.

36:19.352 --> 36:21.219
Uh, we're gonna go catch a movie.

36:21.253 --> 36:23.021
I'll see ya on Monday.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.389
Sounds great. Have fun.

36:24.573 --> 36:25.540
Thanks.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.380
So, what...

36:32.414 --> 36:34.282
What exactly are we drinking?

36:34.406 --> 36:36.441
Uh... when it comes to jungle juice,

36:36.475 --> 36:38.343
it's probably best not to ask.

36:38.377 --> 36:40.111
Mm.

36:40.145 --> 36:42.080
Well, I taste fruit punch

36:42.114 --> 36:44.382
and just a hint of nail polish remover.

36:44.416 --> 36:47.252
Oh, well,  that's a good year.

36:47.286 --> 36:48.353
Oh.

36:48.387 --> 36:49.354
Um...

36:49.388 --> 36:52.924
So how is, uh... Emmett?

36:54.126 --> 36:55.193
He is good.

36:55.227 --> 36:57.195
He actually came into town to surprise me.

36:57.229 --> 36:58.329
That's great.

36:58.364 --> 37:00.231
I guess you two are meant
to be after all, huh?

37:00.266 --> 37:01.332
Mm-hmm.

37:01.367 --> 37:04.002
Yeah, I mean we only actually
had, like, five seconds

37:04.036 --> 37:05.970
alone together and then
we got into this huge fight

37:06.005 --> 37:07.939
and he just took off, so...

37:10.009 --> 37:12.010
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be telling you this.

37:12.044 --> 37:13.211
No, it's cool.

37:13.245 --> 37:14.812
We're friends.

37:14.847 --> 37:15.980
If you need to vent, I can listen.

37:16.015 --> 37:17.148
Thank you.

37:19.184 --> 37:22.086
Let's just say this long
distance thing sucks.

37:22.121 --> 37:24.122
On the bright side, we're at a party.

37:24.156 --> 37:25.657
We are attractive.

37:26.725 --> 37:27.825
We are not under house arrest.

37:29.628 --> 37:31.562
The night is young and so are we.

37:32.965 --> 37:33.898
To the night.

37:33.932 --> 37:35.566
To the night!

37:35.601 --> 37:36.567
Yeah.

37:46.252 --> 37:47.719
Hey.

37:48.888 --> 37:49.855
Hi.

37:49.889 --> 37:51.857
I need the papers for the BMW.

37:51.891 --> 37:53.759
I'm thinking about trading it in.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.060
Is that in the study, or..?

37:55.094 --> 37:56.862
Are you, uh...

37:56.896 --> 37:58.030
Sure?

37:59.899 --> 38:01.700
Don't really have much of a choice.

38:02.969 --> 38:03.936
Yeah.

38:05.738 --> 38:07.973
Your dad and I shouldn't have
cut off your phone like that.

38:08.007 --> 38:10.642
That was a little crazy.

38:12.579 --> 38:14.746
I was just blindsided. I mean, you know...

38:14.781 --> 38:16.882
You guys have always paid for stuff

38:16.916 --> 38:18.650
and then suddenly

38:18.685 --> 38:20.619
'cause you're feeling weird about it.

38:21.721 --> 38:25.524
I love that you rely on us, but...

38:25.558 --> 38:27.559
I don't think we should
keep paying for things

38:27.594 --> 38:29.361
just to keep you close.

38:31.631 --> 38:33.432
I guess I don't want that either.

38:35.568 --> 38:38.537
The paperwork's in the
filing cabinet in the study.

38:38.571 --> 38:39.738
Cool.

38:41.708 --> 38:43.642
Actually, there was something else.

38:43.676 --> 38:46.378
I was wondering if you wouldn't
mind listening to a new song

38:46.412 --> 38:47.446
I've been working on.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.614
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

38:51.618 --> 38:54.252
âª This is a song from a musical âª

38:54.287 --> 38:57.556
âª I'm gonna write a
musical with my mom âª

38:59.525 --> 39:00.525
Really?

39:00.560 --> 39:01.493
I'm in!

39:01.527 --> 39:02.594
Oh, good!

39:02.629 --> 39:04.496
I am so excited!

39:04.580 --> 39:05.880
When do we start?

39:05.915 --> 39:07.716
Uh... well, first thing's first.

39:08.784 --> 39:10.184
I'm gonna need to read the book.

39:10.920 --> 39:11.920
What?

39:11.954 --> 39:14.789
- What? Toby, you haven't read my book?
- I'm sorry.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.500
Hi.

39:29.405 --> 39:30.538
Hi.

39:33.409 --> 39:34.609
I'm so sorry.

39:39.548 --> 39:42.450
I'm just so stressed out all the time.

39:42.485 --> 39:44.319
And I'm terrified

39:44.353 --> 39:46.688
that I'm gonna fail and let everyone down.

39:46.722 --> 39:48.523
I know.

39:48.557 --> 39:50.492
After everything I put
you through last spring.

39:50.526 --> 39:51.659
It's all right.

39:54.463 --> 39:57.298
And I shouldn't have gone
to see your professor.

39:58.734 --> 40:01.403
I wanted to make sure they were being fair.

40:04.273 --> 40:07.542
And I think that I was curious

40:07.576 --> 40:10.678
to meet this amazing woman
who you respect so much.

40:13.582 --> 40:15.250
Oh, mom.

40:16.318 --> 40:17.519
She's great.

40:17.553 --> 40:19.554
But I wouldn't trade you for anyone.

40:22.358 --> 40:23.491
Thanks.

40:26.328 --> 40:28.263
So what are you gonna do?

40:29.498 --> 40:31.166
Well, I spoke to her.

40:32.201 --> 40:33.234
And...

40:33.269 --> 40:36.471
She gave me extra credit
so I could get my grade up.

40:36.505 --> 40:38.073
What?

40:38.107 --> 40:39.140
I know.

40:39.175 --> 40:41.109
I think you got through to her.

40:41.143 --> 40:43.211
This calls for a celebration.

40:43.245 --> 40:45.213
Bad movie and gelato?

40:45.247 --> 40:46.247
Yes!

40:46.282 --> 40:48.249
I'll get the blanket.

40:48.284 --> 40:49.484
I'll get the gelato.
