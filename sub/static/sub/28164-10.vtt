WEBVTT

00:21.396 --> 00:23.023
[Randall] Why didn't he kill us?

00:23.356 --> 00:25.608
[Hamish]
He's saving us for target practice.

00:28.236 --> 00:31.156
-We should probably--
-Give him some space. Great idea.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.159
-I was thinking more like a group hug.
-Nope.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.501
[door opens]

00:44.377 --> 00:45.378
[door shuts]

00:46.004 --> 00:47.172
Why was he there?

00:49.466 --> 00:50.925
What was he thinking?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.347
He was trying to save you.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.143
Jack...

01:02.353 --> 01:03.188
just...

01:05.148 --> 01:07.192
just forget the Tao of Pete for once.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.449
[truck door clicks]

01:20.997 --> 01:23.124
Pops was the only family I ever had.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.669
And now he's gone.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.800
If you go back there...

01:33.218 --> 01:34.177
you'll die.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.096
Well, as long as he dies first.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.431
[Alyssa] Why does it have to be revenge?

01:38.515 --> 01:40.517
[Jack yelling]
Why are you trying to protect him?

01:40.600 --> 01:41.434
[Alyssa gasps]

01:42.477 --> 01:44.062
[Jack snarls]

01:44.145 --> 01:47.398
-[faint ringing sound]
-[Jack breathes heavily]

01:51.319 --> 01:52.362
I'm sorry.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.490
I'm trying to protect you.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.837
There's another way to stop him.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.173
There's got to be.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.137
We'll find it together, okay?

02:30.483 --> 02:32.527
I'm not getting out of this truck
until you do.

03:00.638 --> 03:01.890
[door clicks]

03:05.393 --> 03:06.269
[door bangs shut]

03:19.199 --> 03:20.074
[Randall] Jack.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.620
-I'm so sorry about your grandfather.
-Let's just...

03:23.703 --> 03:25.622
-not talk about it.
-[Hamish] Okay.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.498
Let's talk about Lilith.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.125
Where is she?

03:29.334 --> 03:32.462
She wolfed out and distracted Edward,
bought me time to escape.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.047
And then?

03:34.505 --> 03:36.549
[Alyssa sighing] I don't know.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.012
I'll check her hide locker.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.140
[door shuts]

03:46.309 --> 03:49.020
What were you thinking? We had a plan.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.356
Alyssa was in danger.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.025
I had to help. That alright with you?

03:54.108 --> 03:57.320
No, because you keep doing whatever
you wanna do, and people end up dead.

03:58.821 --> 03:59.906
[door opens]

04:00.531 --> 04:03.493
-Lilith's hide isn't there.
-Or missing, just as bad.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.037
The point is, how many more people
need to die because of you?

04:07.372 --> 04:08.456
Only one more.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.017
Look, Jack--

04:28.101 --> 04:30.478
[Jack] I know we have to focus
on killing Coventry.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.772
We have to rescue Lilith.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.441
What we have to do is get that book
away from Edward.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.027
I don't recall our last Marvel team-up
working out so well.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.946
The book is key to everything.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.699
And right now,
Edward is at his most vulnerable.

04:42.782 --> 04:43.908
You sure about that?

04:43.992 --> 04:47.787
He needs to complete the final sacrifice
before the Vade Maecum will bond with him.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.372
What's the final sacrifice?

04:50.832 --> 04:51.874
His son.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.043
[Jack] His firstborn son.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.007
You know what we need to do
to beat Coventry?

05:02.719 --> 05:03.845
Absolutely nothing.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.642
[all] What the fuck?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.607
[crow cawing]

05:22.488 --> 05:23.740
[doors bang shut]

05:24.032 --> 05:24.866
Grand Magus.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.201
-[electric buzz]
-[Kepler gasps]

05:29.454 --> 05:30.288
Kepler.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.253
Kepler, why are you here?

05:38.212 --> 05:39.088
Because...

05:39.922 --> 05:40.882
you summoned me.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.345
Why do we keep the Gnostic Council around?

05:46.679 --> 05:50.975
I like to think of us
as The Order's voice of reason, Magus.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.561
Do you think Vera considered herself
the voice of reason

05:53.644 --> 05:56.481
when she conspired
to take the Vade Maecum away from me?

05:56.564 --> 05:58.483
[Kepler] I assure you, Magus,

05:58.566 --> 06:00.610
I knew nothing about Vera's intentions.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.616
You're telling the truth.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.078
I am, Magus. I am telling the truth.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.413
If I had known anything,
I'd have come to you immediately.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.207
Quit while you're ahead.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.462
[Edward] Hemmings is dead.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.964
Vera betrayed me.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.386
That leaves me with you.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.890
Yes, Magus. Thank you.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.475
The werewolves are circling.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.646
They're trying to take
the Vade Maecum away from me.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.982
It's your job to stop them.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.275
Do you understand?

06:43.945 --> 06:47.198
[Edward] Send some disciples to my house
to get my son. I want him here with me.

06:47.281 --> 06:48.157
[Kepler] At once.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.452
And Kepler...

06:54.747 --> 06:56.999
I'm going to dissolve the Gnostic Council.

07:00.628 --> 07:01.462
Not literally.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.089
Thank God.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.215
You're welcome.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.436
-[Randall] Dude.
-[door slams]

07:16.978 --> 07:19.897
-We cannot leave Lilith in there.
-You heard Alyssa. Lilith made her choice.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.150
She sacrificed herself for your girlfriend

07:22.233 --> 07:23.776
and you're gonna thank her
by leaving her there?

07:23.860 --> 07:26.028
We both know she can take care of herself.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.365
-It doesn't mean she should have to.
-I thought we gave our lives to the cause?

07:29.449 --> 07:32.577
Yes, but the oath doesn't say anything
about abandoning our friends.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.036
She shouldn't want my help anyways.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.456
I'd probably just get her killed.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.460
Good luck talking any sense into him.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.296
Nothing?

07:43.379 --> 07:45.631
-That's your big plan?
-That is my plan.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.301
I can't believe
you're just gonna run away.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.554
I'm not running, I'm lying low. And when
Edward fails to pay the final sacrifice--

07:51.637 --> 07:53.723
You mean as soon as he murders
your little brother.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.766
He's not my brother. Okay?

07:56.893 --> 07:58.269
Keep telling yourself that.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.772
You know what, it's Eddie's turn
to feel what loss is like.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.858
Now give me my fucking keys.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.070
[keys rattle, thud]

08:15.119 --> 08:16.913
[crossing bell rings]

08:16.996 --> 08:18.331
[train horn honks]

08:21.501 --> 08:23.252
Come on, Pops, where did you put it?

08:31.552 --> 08:32.512
Come on.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.559
[chair rattles]

08:40.853 --> 08:42.605
Please, tell me you fixed it.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.567
Damn it, Pops!

08:46.984 --> 08:49.320
Why do you have to make thinks
so fucking hard?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.031
[snarls]

08:52.406 --> 08:56.744
-[rising sounds]
-[crashing on doors]

08:56.827 --> 08:59.830
[snarling]

09:02.542 --> 09:04.377
This is as bad as Jack's idea.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.712
-I think it's great.
-That's because you suggested it.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.340
-[Randall] You love it.
-[Hamish] I said it has potential.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.218
[Alyssa]
Abduct Maddox and trade him for Lilith?

09:12.301 --> 09:14.637
We get Lilith out of The Order's clutches.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.808
Edward sacrifices the wrong son,
the Vade Maecum fails. It's perfect.

09:19.058 --> 09:19.934
It's murder.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.562
At best,
it's depraved indifference to human life.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.690
-I always forget you were pre-law.
-My father doesn't.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.943
-I can't be a part of this.
-You don't have to do anything.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.695
Just tell us where Edward lives.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.863
And how do I know
you won't kill anyone else?

09:34.031 --> 09:37.618
-[Randall] We promise.
-We promise not to kill anyone else.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.454
I don't believe you.

09:40.788 --> 09:44.542
-That's probably for the best.
-Yeah. We were lying.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.128
The Order isn't evil.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.922
We'll have to agree to disagree.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.926
I guess I should leave, then.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.845
You probably should.

10:13.529 --> 10:14.363
Jack?

10:14.488 --> 10:15.990
[metal can rattles]

10:22.038 --> 10:23.873
[Alyssa sighs] The Necrophone.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.004
Why are you here?

10:32.715 --> 10:34.216
I just came to see

10:34.300 --> 10:36.552
how your "doing nothing" plan
was working out.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.220
Oh, it's a lot better

10:38.304 --> 10:40.723
than your "sacrifice Jack
for a brother he doesn't even know

10:40.806 --> 10:43.392
to try and get a book
that can't be destroyed" plan.

10:44.393 --> 10:45.770
I didn't come here to fight.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.815
We both know nothing good
comes from talking to the dead.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.654
At least I could have apologized.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.406
-For what?
-For turning my back on him.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.742
We had a plan.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.577
All I had to do

11:02.370 --> 11:04.914
was stick to it
and we wouldn't be in this mess.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.290
But I had to go and...

11:07.792 --> 11:09.377
try to be a fucking hero.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.756
-It's not your fault he's dead.
-No. It's yours.

11:14.715 --> 11:15.925
Don't do that.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.968
Don't push me away.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.970
[Jack] We both know I'm better off alone.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.390
You tried to tell me that
and I should have listened.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.766
Well, I was wrong.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.143
Are you saying that
because you believe it,

11:26.852 --> 11:27.978
or because you need help?

11:28.187 --> 11:29.814
Honestly, a little bit of both.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.108
We can save Maddox.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.902
-I don't care about him.
-Yes, you do.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.030
How do you know?

11:39.031 --> 11:41.450
Because compassion
is in every decision you make.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.579
Yeah, well compassion can go fuck itself.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.460
I wish I didn't care.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.924
I wish I had never been accepted
into The Order...

11:58.134 --> 12:00.302
or met you or the Knights.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.640
You know, maybe then, I would have a life.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.936
Instead of wondering who's
gonna die next because of me.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.732
You should go.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.695
I mean, Midnight doesn't really
deal with emotion that well.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.199
Look, if I change, I may hurt you.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.886
Even if I wanna save that kid...

12:43.471 --> 12:45.639
there's no way
I could take on Edward alone.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.850
You're not alone.

12:49.852 --> 12:50.811
I can show you.

12:56.942 --> 12:57.902
[cellphone clicks]

12:59.153 --> 13:00.112
It's safe.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.408
No, he won't kill you.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.162
Yes, he promises.
Just tell them that you won't kill him?

13:08.245 --> 13:10.039
-Who is it? I won't kill you.
-Just say it.

13:11.040 --> 13:11.957
Who?

13:19.048 --> 13:21.008
-Are you kidding me?
-She's on our side.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.384
She's on her side.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.428
Remember what you promised.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.181
[car door opens]

13:31.352 --> 13:32.186
[door slams]

13:33.437 --> 13:34.730
Mr. Morton.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.275
This is the part where you buy me a drink.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.707
Single barrel.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.127
At least your grandfather had some taste.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.463
It certainly wasn't in interior design.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.507
Insult my grandfather again
and see what happens.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.844
-Mind your tone, Acolyte.
-Go fuck yourself, Magus.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.555
-Well, this is a waste of time.
-It isn't.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.765
-Yeah, it is. She's right.
-No, she's not.

14:12.059 --> 14:15.145
-I apologize, Magus.
-Just get to the point, Ms. Drake.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.357
Okay, let's just say for a second
that we all agreed

14:18.440 --> 14:20.818
that destroying the Vade Maecum
is our first priority.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.236
It's not.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.363
Would Nephilim's Tears do the trick?

14:27.283 --> 14:30.494
Oh, you took advantage of your time
in the reliquary, I'll give you that.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.247
Er... Nephilim's Tears?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.040
[Vera] It's a potion.

14:35.207 --> 14:38.460
It removes enchantments
from magical objects.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.171
Like a paint stripper for magic spells?

14:41.255 --> 14:43.173
Yes, sure.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.092
Just like that.

14:45.175 --> 14:49.096
It's also impossible to make,
even if I did have my reliquary. So...

14:49.513 --> 14:50.347
Why's that?

14:51.223 --> 14:53.601
Because Nephilim's Tears require
the blood of--

14:54.226 --> 14:55.853
Son of a bitch.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.271
She means werewolf.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.608
You're the one who's been trying
to dismantle The Order.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.402
-I can't believe I fell for your speech!
-I don't care about The Order.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.362
-You've made that clear.
-All I want is Coventry.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.239
-Why?
-Because he's my father.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.033
And...

15:11.785 --> 15:14.622
And my mother and my grandfather
are dead because of him.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.920
We'll still need a reliquary.

I can get you one.

This is the <i>Eighth Book of Solomon.</i>

to brew the Nephilim's Tears?

16:05.506 --> 16:09.134
It will do, I suppose.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.220
Okay, great. Let's go.

What if you don't return?
What if your friends return first?

16:20.020 --> 16:21.480
Mm...

16:22.564 --> 16:25.067
I'll let 'em know you're here, okay?
It's all good.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.696
I said I'd work with you,
I didn't say I trusted you.

-You're sure they won't kill her?
-Not at all.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.201

He's not in here.

Tell me this wasn't Hamish and Randall.
And don't lie.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.408
Well, I can't do both.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.169

Kepler, tell me you have Maddox.

I'd say that's impossible, since those

Yes, I'm sure.

You're trapped.

You're powerless.

The only logical course

Fine.

I'll bring him to you at the temple.

You'll have your sacrifice

And in exchange?

20:11.793 --> 20:13.045
You don't kill my friends.

20:17.132 --> 20:17.966
No.

-That's too easy.
-There's nothing easy about it.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.184
Well, that's quite the sacrifice.

Why?

20:29.770 --> 20:31.396
[Jack] The fact you don't know

is why I've hated you my entire life.

But I can't live
with all this hate anymore.

if I give you what you want,
you won't slaughter everyone I care about.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.000
-Would you be so kind.
-Yeah.

28:34.713 --> 28:35.922
I am an idiot.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.049
I know.

28:48.309 --> 28:50.562
Are you... smiling?

28:51.646 --> 28:52.522
No.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.399
Fuck you.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.155
[birds tweeting]

29:00.739 --> 29:01.573
[snap]

29:04.325 --> 29:05.744
Sorry about that, bird.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.761
[snarling sound]

29:24.345 --> 29:26.347
Jack! It's me, Clay.

29:26.639 --> 29:27.515
First rule,

29:28.099 --> 29:29.142
don't kill me.

29:29.684 --> 29:32.771
I couldn't kill you, even if I wanted to.
You made me.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.397
I could never hurt my creator.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.607
[laughs]

29:35.732 --> 29:38.443
You have a lot to learn
about family relationships.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.862
[Jack] The last time I saw you
was in that weird church.

29:42.530 --> 29:43.531
You look taller.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.993
-A lot's happened since then.
-Not for me.

29:47.535 --> 29:51.289
I dismantled that lady,
but then after that, nothing.

29:51.414 --> 29:52.499
Not even darkness.

29:52.582 --> 29:56.461
It was like, one second I was there,
the next second I was here.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.715
Do you think that's what death's like?
Nothing?

30:00.799 --> 30:02.675
Death is like a dream, Clay.

30:03.384 --> 30:06.638
It's a collection of memories
and fantasies blended together

30:06.721 --> 30:10.558
into a singular place.
There's no anger, no obligation,

30:10.642 --> 30:11.893
just contentment.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.647
-You sound so high.
-No!

30:16.356 --> 30:18.983
Clay, I need your help
to destroy The Order.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.819
-Will I have to kill anyone?
-Maybe.

30:20.902 --> 30:24.155
-Okay. So, what's the plan?
-We'll go to that weird church,

30:24.239 --> 30:27.075
I'm gonna stop my father
from completing the Vade Maecum.

30:27.534 --> 30:28.493
[Clay] That's it?

30:28.785 --> 30:30.787
That's not really a plan,
that's more of an end goal.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.417
Your boy...

30:38.670 --> 30:39.796
running late.

30:44.759 --> 30:47.846
Always disappointing to find out
that you can't trust someone.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.390
I was thinking the same thing.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.934
I see what you did there.

30:53.017 --> 30:53.852
[laughs]

31:03.236 --> 31:04.988
You think I'm a monster, don't you?

31:05.071 --> 31:08.700
[Alyssa] You're the one about to sacrifice
his own son for personal gain.

31:13.204 --> 31:16.249
Jack Morton is bringing Maddox here
to save your life.

31:16.332 --> 31:20.253
So, that's how you're gonna justify it?
How do you justify asking me to kill Vera?

31:31.014 --> 31:32.056
I don't.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.226
I gave you a task.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.604
You failed.

31:39.772 --> 31:43.109
The fact that you are alive
is an indication of my benevolence.

31:43.192 --> 31:46.195
You can drop the merciful God routine.
I'm not buying it.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.239
You shouldn't.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.075
[doors clunk]

31:54.537 --> 31:55.371
[Jack] Hey.

31:56.956 --> 31:57.999
[doors bang shut]

31:58.082 --> 31:59.876
Jack, you shouldn't have come.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.504
Did you forget something?

32:03.588 --> 32:05.715
You wanted me to bring
your firstborn son.

32:05.965 --> 32:06.966
Here I am.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.097
Bullshit.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.182
Alyssa, tell him.

32:15.224 --> 32:16.893
No, Jack, he'll kill you.

32:17.977 --> 32:20.855
[Jack] If you don't tell him the truth,
he'll kill both of us.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.526
Is Jack Morton my son?

32:26.152 --> 32:27.070
No.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.030
[ting]

32:30.823 --> 32:31.950
You're lying.

32:36.663 --> 32:37.830
Why didn't you tell me?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.959
-Would it have made any difference?
-No.

32:41.584 --> 32:44.003
Let's go, son. The clock's ticking.

32:44.837 --> 32:46.464
Let Alyssa go. You promised.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.383
She stays to bear witness.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.718
I can't watch you kill him.

32:50.802 --> 32:51.678
You will,

32:52.595 --> 32:54.847
or so help me, I'll pluck your eyes out.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.434
There's more than one way to make you see.

32:59.894 --> 33:00.853
Don't worry.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.064
I won't feel a thing.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.118
Jack Morton...

33:16.369 --> 33:18.371
firstborn of Edward Coventry...

33:21.207 --> 33:22.667
have you come willingly?

33:23.960 --> 33:24.877
Yes.

33:26.713 --> 33:27.922
Let it be known.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.426
[faint ringing]

33:35.430 --> 33:36.639
<i>Sanguinem...</i>

33:37.432 --> 33:40.601
<i>do ut des potentiam!</i>

33:40.685 --> 33:41.894
[screams] No!

33:43.938 --> 33:46.274
All of you, leave. Now!

33:49.235 --> 33:51.070
[snarling]

33:51.154 --> 33:52.155
[roaring]

33:52.530 --> 33:53.489
[screaming]

33:53.573 --> 33:58.369
-[snarling]
-[screaming continues]

34:01.539 --> 34:02.665
[bang]

34:02.749 --> 34:04.792
Edward's sealed them from the inside!

34:05.126 --> 34:06.669
-[snarls]
-[crash]

34:06.753 --> 34:09.881
-[door bangs]
-[latch rattles]

34:09.964 --> 34:10.965
[Alyssa screams] No!

34:12.091 --> 34:14.093
[Edward gasps]

34:14.552 --> 34:16.554
[Alyssa whimpers]

34:24.896 --> 34:26.439
[Edward whispers] It's not working.

34:27.356 --> 34:28.357
It's not working.

34:28.441 --> 34:30.318
-[Edward gasps]
-[Alyssa] Stop!

34:31.027 --> 34:32.403
-[Edward grunts]
-[Alyssa sobs]

34:32.487 --> 34:33.488
[sound of metal]

34:35.573 --> 34:36.532
[Edward gasps]

34:38.409 --> 34:39.410
Why isn't it working?

34:42.622 --> 34:44.582
-[papers rustle]
-[door opens]

34:45.500 --> 34:48.127
[male voice]
Probably because you sacrificed a golem.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.213
Jack!

34:57.178 --> 34:58.262
[Jack] You were right.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.265
Sometimes the aggressive game
is the wrong tactic.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.850
-[cellphone beeps]
-No!

35:03.935 --> 35:04.811
I killed you!

35:07.313 --> 35:08.439
You lied to me!

35:09.273 --> 35:11.859
Whatever happens next... is on you.

35:14.821 --> 35:15.822
[Edward grunts]

35:22.703 --> 35:23.788
Let's be clear.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.833
Whatever happens next is on you.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.254
[crackling]

35:31.337 --> 35:32.547
[Edward gasps]

35:33.381 --> 35:35.341
[Edward screaming]

35:35.633 --> 35:37.593
[Edward roars]

35:37.760 --> 35:39.971
[crackling continues]

35:41.013 --> 35:42.014
[door crashes open]

35:42.640 --> 35:45.226
Jack! Glad to see you're not dead.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.063
I'll see you in hell.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.238
You have the potion?

35:57.488 --> 35:58.990
[Vera] That's highly volatile.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.297
[explosion of fire]

36:50.124 --> 36:52.418
[Vera] I'm not sure what to do with you,

36:52.919 --> 36:54.003
Mr. Morton.

36:55.630 --> 36:56.839
On the one hand...

36:57.882 --> 37:00.259
The Order owes you a great debt.

37:02.303 --> 37:05.848
And on the other, you are seditious,
untrustworthy, and a werewolf.

37:06.641 --> 37:07.975
I don't know whose side you're on.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.186
My own.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.730
Ah! Independent, as well.

37:13.314 --> 37:16.525
That's a character trait
most secret societies try to avoid.

37:16.692 --> 37:18.611
Well, it doesn't make me your enemy.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.905
I took a chance on you once.

37:22.865 --> 37:25.201
Now I'm wondering
if it was the right call.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.036
Maybe I'm not your call to make.

37:27.787 --> 37:28.621
Hmm.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.498
Hmm.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.459
If you had your choice, what would you do?

37:35.378 --> 37:36.837
I wanna be a disciple...

37:37.338 --> 37:38.172
and a Knight.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.175
-That's not the way this world works.
-Well, I've seen how the world works,

37:41.259 --> 37:44.303
-and I've seen what it does to people.
-Oh, and you wanna change it.

37:44.387 --> 37:47.640
I've heard that speech before
from your father.

37:47.723 --> 37:49.600
-I'm gonna be--
-Be different?

37:50.351 --> 37:51.185
[laughs]

37:51.519 --> 37:52.395
Yes.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.815
Yes. I have heard that one as well.

38:06.158 --> 38:07.159
Are we done here?

38:09.036 --> 38:12.206
As long as you remain a member
of this organization,

38:12.290 --> 38:15.209
you will treat me
with the reverence that I am due.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.878
My apologies, Grand Magus.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.551
You're lucky I like you.

38:23.634 --> 38:24.844
[chuckles]

38:24.927 --> 38:26.012
You like me?

38:26.887 --> 38:27.972
Isn't it obvious?

38:34.270 --> 38:35.271
[door rattles]

38:40.568 --> 38:42.445
Just remember, Mr. Morton.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.699
The choice you refuse to make

38:47.074 --> 38:48.993
is the one that will be made for you.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.127
[door rattles closed]

39:25.613 --> 39:27.990
Easy on the bitters. We're not farmers.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.618
-[bang]
-Whoa!

39:32.078 --> 39:34.080
You're not getting rid of that, are you?

39:34.705 --> 39:35.748
Take a look.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.046
[rattling]

39:42.129 --> 39:42.963
Silverback?

39:43.047 --> 39:44.465
[chest clunks open]

39:45.091 --> 39:47.301
But I thought the Nephilim's Tears
destroyed him.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.136
When the potion destroyed the book,

39:49.220 --> 39:51.514
it freed Silverback from his bond
with the Vade Maecum.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.599
He's good as new.

39:54.433 --> 39:55.643
All he needs now...

39:56.519 --> 39:57.645
is a champion.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.022
If anything, I think he needs some rest.

40:00.314 --> 40:03.109
-But Midnight--
-Is starting to grow on me.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.653
Besides, I've died enough this week.

40:07.780 --> 40:08.864
[Hamish] So...

40:08.948 --> 40:10.324
what should we drink to?

40:10.408 --> 40:12.243
-Victory.
-Survival.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.747
-How about to family?
-Lame.

40:16.872 --> 40:18.249
-I don't know you.
-To family?

40:18.332 --> 40:20.543
When did we turn into an episode
of <i>This Is Us?</i>

40:20.626 --> 40:22.461
Okay, someone pick something else then.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.384
-Hamish?
-Fuck it. Let's just drink.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.637
[Jack] Hey, I heard you guys kissed.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.223
[Jack] Hey, Mom.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.517
Hey, Pops.

40:37.810 --> 40:38.727
So, it's done.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.440
Coventry's gone.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.068
But I guess you already know that.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.489
I gotta tell you, it's kind of weird.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.784
I'm not sure what's gonna happen next.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.538
Not sure what I'm supposed to do.

40:58.205 --> 40:59.582
[Alyssa] Whatever you want.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.084
Hey.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.043
Hi.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.304
Sorry I'm late.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.223
How'd it go with the Grand Magus?

41:18.017 --> 41:20.519
She promoted me to Magistratus.

41:22.730 --> 41:23.898
That's great, isn't it?

41:26.192 --> 41:28.068
[chuckles] Well...

41:28.861 --> 41:30.696
there is the high mortality rate.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.865
I think you'll be okay.

41:33.407 --> 41:34.450
[light chuckle]

41:38.454 --> 41:40.080
It's a lot more responsibility.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.666
A lot less time for us.

41:43.542 --> 41:47.671
Alyssa, after what we just went through,
a promotion is nothing.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.008
Hey, we can make it work.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.595
What if we can't?

41:55.513 --> 41:57.598
We live in two different worlds.

41:58.307 --> 42:00.142
I'm with The Order,
you're with the Knights.

42:00.226 --> 42:02.520
-I'm still with The Order.
-For how long?

42:04.563 --> 42:08.234
What happens when we find ourselves
on opposite sides? Again.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.278
You talk about it like it's inevitable.

42:12.613 --> 42:15.533
We'll deal with it if the time comes.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.034
Okay?

42:18.285 --> 42:19.370
Until then, I...

42:20.788 --> 42:22.623
I think we deserve a bit of a break.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.128
-You're right.
-Yeah. I know.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.380
[both laugh]

42:31.423 --> 42:32.758
Now, on that note,

42:34.260 --> 42:35.719
I was wondering

42:36.387 --> 42:39.723
if you would like to go out with me...

42:41.267 --> 42:42.184
sometime?

42:42.810 --> 42:45.896
-Like on a date?
-Yeah, I was thinking dinner,

42:46.564 --> 42:47.481
a movie.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.776
We go fight a golem, if Clay's available.

42:51.694 --> 42:53.153
I'll have to think about it.

42:54.071 --> 42:56.574
-Can I get back to you?
-Yeah, sure.

42:56.991 --> 42:57.992
No pressure.

42:58.742 --> 43:00.411
You can let me know whenever you want...

43:00.744 --> 43:01.996
in the next ten seconds.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.708
Ten, nine,

43:06.417 --> 43:08.877
eight, seven...

43:12.381 --> 43:13.382
six...

43:30.566 --> 43:32.151
[Alyssa whispers] I love you.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.487
-I love you, too.
