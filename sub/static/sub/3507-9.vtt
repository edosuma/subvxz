<Font color="#ffff00">sync:frm@°®ð¦µäñû¾¦</font>

00:10.700 --> 00:11.800
Morning!

00:11.900 --> 00:13.200
Grande skim latte,

00:13.200 --> 00:15.600
Two pumps sugar-Free vanilla
and a bear claw.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.200
- How did you know--
- I'm a novelist.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.800
It's my job to
notice things.

00:20.000 --> 00:20.800
It's sunday morning.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.000
Shouldn't you be slinking home
from a scandalous liaison?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.100
Would you be jealous
if i were?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.000
In your dreams.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.400
Actually, in my dreams
you're never jealous.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.200
In my dreams,
you just joined in

00:32.299 --> 00:35.100
Well, montgomery called and said,
"come down right away,"

00:35.100 --> 00:36.300
So it must
be gruesome.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.500
Try not to get so giddy every time
we go to a crime scene, okay?

00:39.600 --> 00:41.800
Just 'cause somebody's dead
doesn't mean you have to be grumpy.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.800
Oh, do you want
to see grumpy?

00:43.800 --> 00:46.100
How about the cover art
for your new novel?

00:46.100 --> 00:47.600
"Nikki heat" cover art?

00:47.700 --> 00:49.400
That's only available to..

00:49.800 --> 00:51.800
Oh, my god.
You subscribe to my web site?

00:51.800 --> 00:54.700
Wait a minute.
Are you castlefreak1-2-1-2?

00:54.800 --> 00:56.400
Castlelover45?

00:56.500 --> 01:01.200
You do realize that most people
would be creeped out by crazy, anonymous fans?

01:01.300 --> 01:02.400
Like you?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.300
It was strictly
professional curiosity.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.800
So what did you think
of your alter ego nikki?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.800
- Pretty sweet, right?
- "Sweet"?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.500
She's naked!

01:11.500 --> 01:16.000
She's not naked.
She's holding a gun...strategically.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.300
You know...

01:18.300 --> 01:20.000
I take comfort
in the fact

01:20.000 --> 01:22.300
That if they're already
publishing the cover art,

01:22.300 --> 01:27.700
Then your book and
our little partnership is almost done.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.300
No coffee in here,
sir.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.000
Sir,
what's going on?

01:35.300 --> 01:36.800
2-Year-Old girl,
angela candela,

01:36.800 --> 01:39.300
Reported missing by her parents
about 8:00 this morning.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.300
Where'd they find the body?

01:40.500 --> 01:42.000
They haven't found her.
She was abducted.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.600
Father was
in the other room painting.

01:43.700 --> 01:44.600
Kidnapped from her home?

01:44.600 --> 01:46.600
I don't understand, sir.
If this isn't a murder,

01:46.600 --> 01:47.600
Why am i here?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.500
The feds requested
you to be on the task force.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.300
Feds?

01:50.300 --> 01:53.000
Fbi has jurisdiction
over child abduction cases.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.100
Then why call me?

01:54.100 --> 01:55.700
'Cause i like
pissing off the fbi,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.300
And because you think
outside the box.

01:57.300 --> 01:58.300
That's something
the feebs rarely do.

01:58.300 --> 01:59.800
Sir, who's the special agent
in charge?

01:59.800 --> 02:02.300
- Beckett, it doesn't matter--
- Sir, who?

02:02.600 --> 02:04.000
Sorenson.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.800
Who's sorenson?

02:06.100 --> 02:07.300
I thought that
he was in--

02:07.300 --> 02:09.100
In boston.
Not anymore. He's here.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.000
Who's sorenson?

02:10.100 --> 02:11.700
This isn't gonna
be a problem, is it, detective?

02:11.700 --> 02:13.100
I mean, we're all
professionals here, right?

02:13.100 --> 02:15.000
Actually, i'm not.
Who's sorenson?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.700
No, sir.
Not a problem.

02:16.700 --> 02:17.700
For what it's worth,

02:17.700 --> 02:21.000
That missing little girl
doesn't care about your history,

02:21.000 --> 02:22.500
Nor do her terrified parents.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.900
They just want
their baby back alive.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
Where is he, sir?

02:26.700 --> 02:29.000
He's over there
talking to the parents.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.200
Montgomery.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.800
Yeah, please.
Whatever you need.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.700
Excuse me.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.900
- Hello, kate.
- Hello, will.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.600
How long have you been back?

02:44.100 --> 02:45.500
A couple months.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.100
Something wrong
with boston?

02:48.200 --> 02:50.500
Fresh lobster
gets old fast.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.600
You look good.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.300
Thanks.
I feel good.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.400
Agent sorenson,
this is richard castle.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.400
The famous novelist.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
Writer of wrongs.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.200
So captain montgomery filled me in
on your little arrangement.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.100
I have no problem with it

03:08.100 --> 03:10.500
As long as it doesn't interfere
with the investigation.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.200
Oh, don't worry about me.
Quiet as a mouse.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.100
Angela candela,
2 years old,

03:19.100 --> 03:21.800
Abducted this morning
between 7:30 and 8:00 a.M.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.000
Parents were home
at the time.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.600
How do you get abducted
when your parents are home?

03:26.200 --> 03:27.300
Yeah...

03:28.800 --> 03:30.600
Dad got up with the kid
about 7:00,

03:30.600 --> 03:32.200
Let the mom sleep in.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.800
He planted angela in front of the tube
with a juice box and some cereal,

03:35.900 --> 03:38.200
Then headed
into his art studio.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.200
Obviously,
he's a painter.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.400
He just left his kid?

03:43.700 --> 03:45.000
Did he hear anything
at least?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.400
He was listening
to his ipod.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.900
Nothing like a little
quality time with daddy.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.300
Castle
s01 ep09

03:56.600 --> 03:58.900
When i couldn't find her,
i looked everywhere for her,

03:58.900 --> 04:01.400
And then
i saw the window.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.300
The lock was jimmied
from the outside.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.500
I- I ran outside.
I looked for her.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.600
Mr. Candela, you live on
a ground floor apartment

04:10.600 --> 04:12.200
With windows
facing the alleyway.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.600
Most people have bars.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.100
We were going to.
We just--

04:15.100 --> 04:16.700
I never got
around to it.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.899
We think
the dirt's from the outside.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.500
How could this happen
in our own home?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.800
So our suspect climbed
in through the window,

04:23.800 --> 04:26.900
Grabbed angela and
probably walked out the back door.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.700
Just like that?

04:27.700 --> 04:29.000
We have her photo on the wires

04:29.000 --> 04:31.700
And are issuing an amber alert
to the port authority and the tri-State area.

04:31.700 --> 04:35.200
I'll have my guys run any registered
sex offenders and residential burglaries.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.600
What about the parents?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.500
Anyone they can think of?

04:38.600 --> 04:41.200
No, not that either of them
can think straight right now.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.600
This thing goes south,
they'll never think straight again.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.900
Agent sorenson?

04:45.500 --> 04:48.000
The phone's over there.
Get a tap on it.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.700
This one will end better.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.300
I promise.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:04.200 --> 05:05.500
Six months.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.800
Six months what?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.800
We dated for six months.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.600
I didn't ask.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.500
Yeah, i know.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.500
You were not asking
very loudly.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.900
I know.
I'm like a jedi like that.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.200
So how'd you meet?

05:24.500 --> 05:26.600
Kidnapping.
A 6-Year-Old boy.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.100
How'd it end?

05:28.500 --> 05:29.700
We got the guy.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.200
What do we got
on the parents?

05:31.700 --> 05:34.000
Theresa and alfred candela--

05:34.000 --> 05:38.100
Married ten years,
one child-- Angela candela.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.700
Sorry.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.500
Sorry about that.
Tie took me a little by surprise.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.800
Okay,
get it all out.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.900
This is a gift
from my girlfriend.

05:49.900 --> 05:50.900
Girlfriend?

05:50.900 --> 05:52.400
Today's our 2-Week anniversary.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.900
Two weeks.
Is that the paper or the silk?

05:55.900 --> 05:57.500
I believe
it's the whipped.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.800
- Good one.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.200
One child--
Angela candela, age 2, adopted.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.100
- Adopted?
- Yeah, two years ago.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.800
Mom-- Theresa, she's a fund manager
at keller stanton.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.900
Dad's a small-Time artist,

06:07.900 --> 06:11.100
Shows at the greyson gallery
in chelsea once in a while.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.900
Neighbor says he stays
home with the kid.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.400
All right, here's a list
of all the people

06:14.400 --> 06:16.000
Who had access
to the apartment--

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Babysitters,
cleaning lady, super.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.700
Let's cross-Reference that with
any registered sex offenders in the area,

06:20.700 --> 06:22.400
See if anyone had a thing
for little girls.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.500
You're thinking that some creepy-Crawly
probably scouted from the inside?

06:26.200 --> 06:29.500
Well, the father said what
he did this morning was part of a routine.

06:29.500 --> 06:33.500
So either somebody got lucky,
or they already knew it.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.200
Beckett.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.600
Yeah,
we'll be right there.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.000
Looks like it wasn't
a creepy-Crawler after all.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Candelas just got
a ransom call.

06:43.700 --> 06:44.500
Hello?

06:44.500 --> 06:45.900
We have your daughter.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.500
Please, she's just a child.
Please don't hurt her.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.100
Whether we hurt her is up to you.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.000
Whether she lives is up to you.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.400
You want your daughter?

06:53.400 --> 06:57.500
We want $750,000.
You have 24 hours.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.000
I want to speak to her.
I want to know she's safe.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.000
They used an internet
voice-Over-I.P. Service.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.000
Meaning it's untraceable.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.500
Can you raise the 750?

07:09.600 --> 07:11.200
It-- It's everything
we have.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.400
If it means getting angela back,
we'll pay.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.300
Then you should start getting
your financial records together.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.000
Mrs. Candela, is there
anyone that you know

07:19.000 --> 07:22.500
That can help you-- An accountant
or maybe someone at your firm?

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500
Nina could help.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.000
- Nina?
- My sister. She's a c.P.A.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.900
But even if we give them
the money,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
How can we be sure
we'll get her back?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.200
You have to have hope.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.200
You have to imagine your little girl
walking through that front door safe and sound.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.200
Your daughter
needs you right now.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.500
She needs you to have faith,
to be strong.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.900
You do this a lot--
Kidnappings?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.500
You seem to know
what to say.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.700
It's not about what you say.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.400
It's about controlling the situation,
controlling the emotions.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.000
You requested your ex-Girlfriend
for the task force.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
That doesn't indicate to me
a control of your emotions.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.000
I requested beckett because
she's the best in the city.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.200
Not because you wanted
to see her again?

08:16.500 --> 08:18.000
How about you, castle?

08:18.500 --> 08:21.100
You've written,
what, 20 best sellers?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.900
Well, 26,
but who's countin'?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.400
Why the sudden need
to shadow a real detective?

08:26.500 --> 08:29.400
Well, the ones on tv seem oddly
fixated on their sunglasses.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.500
So with all the fat,
balding detectives in the nypd,

08:32.600 --> 08:35.400
You just happen
to end up shadowing her.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.100
It must be fate.

08:37.900 --> 08:38.600
Must be.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.500
Candelas have pulled
their financials.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.100
Her sister's on the way.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.100
Anything on the transcripts?

08:44.100 --> 08:46.600
It's clear the ransom demand
has significance.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.400
Kidnappers make an issue
about knowing what the candelas have.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.400
They said it's everything
they have.

08:52.100 --> 08:56.500
Whoever made the demand knows them well enough
to know exactly what they're worth.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.300
How does it look?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Detective, agent sorenson,
this is my sister nina.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.500
It's doable. We'll market
the stocks tomorrow morning.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.100
We'll have to wipe out
the retirement account and both pensions,

09:10.500 --> 09:11.500
And you'll
have to pay penalties.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.700
I don't care.
Whatever it takes.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.900
He paints
when he's stressed.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.200
Does he sell much?

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
Some.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.300
That's generous.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.100
Sorry.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.800
Why do you ask?

09:29.300 --> 09:32.000
I don't know many artists with
their own pension account.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.000
Theresa set up
the account for him

09:34.400 --> 09:37.100
So he'd have something
for him and angela, you know,

09:37.100 --> 09:38.500
- If something--
- Tell me--

09:38.500 --> 09:40.600
Mrs. Candela,

09:40.600 --> 09:43.400
We think the specificity of
the amount of the ransom demand

09:43.400 --> 09:46.100
Suggests the kidnappers
had knowledge of your finances.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.500
Was there anyone who
might've had a grudge against you

09:48.500 --> 09:50.900
Or maybe someone close to you
who need the money now?

09:50.900 --> 09:52.900
No one who would do
something like this.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.500
What about doug ellers?

09:56.400 --> 09:57.500
Who's doug ellers?

09:57.500 --> 10:01.000
Someone i used to work with,
but no, i can't imagine--

10:01.000 --> 10:02.900
What about those messages
he left you at work?

10:02.900 --> 10:04.600
Remember, you filed
those complaints with h.R.?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.500
I know what happened,
alfred.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.900
Mrs. Candela,
i know how hard this is.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.400
It's understandable
to get frustrated.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.000
But please,
we need to know everything.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.300
Ellers ran
an asset management group.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.500
They weren't performing,
so i let him go.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.000
Did he ever threaten you?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.700
Well, he blamed me
for his divorce.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.800
He said his wife left him
because i fired him, and...

10:32.600 --> 10:33.900
And what?

10:34.500 --> 10:37.100
And she took his two kids.

10:39.900 --> 10:40.600
Where'd you find him?

10:40.600 --> 10:42.100
In line
at off-Track betting.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.500
E.S.U.
Just hit his apartment.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.700
- No trace of the kid.
- That's not good.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.500
Pressure interview?

10:47.500 --> 10:49.100
- I'll take the lead.
- Yeah.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.400
No.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.000
He'll be fine,
will.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.500
Kate, i don't care how big
a fan of his you are,

10:54.600 --> 10:56.500
He doesn't come
in the room.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.300
Fine.
That's fine.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.600
Uh, just for the record,
though,

11:02.300 --> 11:04.100
How big a fan
is she?

11:04.900 --> 11:05.900
Come on, castle.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.100
Come watch from
the bleachers with us,

11:08.600 --> 11:09.800
See how the feebies do it.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.700
Mr. Ellers,
detective kate beckett, nypd.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.900
Special agent sorenson, fbi.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.800
When was your last contact
with theresa candela?

11:20.800 --> 11:23.600
Theresa candela?
Wh-Wh-What's going on?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.900
Just answer the question.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.800
What did she
say about me?

11:27.100 --> 11:28.800
Let's talk about...

11:30.300 --> 11:31.900
What you said to her.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.000
I gave you six years
of my life. Six years!

11:35.100 --> 11:37.600
My profits built
your whole damn division.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.100
And now you want
to bend me over?

11:39.100 --> 11:42.600
You want to cut me out?
Well, karma's a bitch, theresa.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.500
You burnt down my house.
I'm gonna burn yours down.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.200
You left that
three months ago,

11:51.100 --> 11:53.100
Just after your wife left.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.200
Yeah?
So?

11:55.600 --> 11:56.600
Every word
of it's true.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.800
It's harassment.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.600
Oh, what,
is she gonna press charges now?

11:59.600 --> 12:02.100
Yeah, kidnapping, assault,
breaking and entering.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.600
What the hell are you
talking about?

12:03.600 --> 12:05.900
Somebody kidnapped
angela candela this morning.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.300
What? Kidnapped?

12:07.300 --> 12:10.400
Hurting someone else's child
isn't the way to get back your own.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.400
No, no, no.
This is not me.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.300
Theresa may not be
my favorite person,

12:14.300 --> 12:16.400
But i would never harm a child.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.600
Your ex-Wife wasn't
so sure.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.600
According to your divorce papers,
there are allegations of violence--

12:19.600 --> 12:23.600
My ex-Wife was looking
for a payday. That's all.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.800
You're not looking for a payday,
are you, mr. Ellers?

12:25.800 --> 12:29.300
You have the wrong guy.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.400
Run him down-- Where he was
all morning, who can vouch.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.000
Pretty clear
it wasn't him.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.500
You a mind reader, too?

12:39.500 --> 12:40.800
Come on,
if he was your guy,

12:40.800 --> 12:42.500
He'd be downplaying
his feelings for theresa,

12:42.500 --> 12:43.600
Not wearing them
on his sleeve.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.700
Couple dozen best sellers doesn't
make you a criminologist.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.300
I also don't need a weatherman to
tell me that the sky is blue.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.500
Oh, for god sakes.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.300
Why don't you both just drop your pants
and get it over with?

12:53.500 --> 12:54.500
I'm game.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.300
The fact is, you're both right.
He probably didn't do it.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.000
But when a child's life is
at stake, we have to be sure.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.600
We have to question everything
we think we know.

13:02.900 --> 13:06.100
You guys keep ellers on ice until
we can trace every second of his morning.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.000
Will, you and i are going
back to the candelas'.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
We're gonna profile
all of their associates.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.400
What should i do?

13:18.300 --> 13:19.900
I need you to
go home.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.400
Okay.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.100
But if you need me,
call...

13:28.300 --> 13:30.100
Even if
it's just to talk.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.400
Todd, honey...

13:43.500 --> 13:48.300
I really, really need you to focus on
calibrating your creative energy.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.100
Now by creative energy,
what do i mean?

13:51.100 --> 13:53.000
I mean the source
of your power.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
The source of your power,
todd, is you.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.000
How do you, mother.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Hello. You're...
you're here.

14:02.900 --> 14:07.400
I'm just finishing up
a session in my office.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.000
I'm so flattered you have
my framed book covers

14:10.000 --> 14:11.200
In your office.

14:11.200 --> 14:15.700
Well, a coach
can never be too proud.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.900
Mr. Castle,
i just wanted to thank you

14:18.900 --> 14:24.200
For being so honest about your struggle
with persistent and chronic writer's block.

14:24.300 --> 14:24.800
Excuse me?

14:24.800 --> 14:28.300
Well, todd is
an aspiring novelist,

14:28.300 --> 14:33.200
So i shared with him your inspiring
tale of triumph over adversity.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.300
Well,
how courageous of me.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.500
Good luck, todd.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.600
Thanks.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.800
I'll take
the year-Long package.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.300
Way to be decisive, kiddo.
Good for you.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.500
- I'll see you next week.
- Thank you.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.800
- Nice to meet you.
- And remember, you is who you is.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.400
And if you ain't who you is,
who is you?

14:51.000 --> 14:55.700
Well, nice to see all those years
as an actress have really paid off.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.400
"Focus on calibrating
your creative energies"?

14:58.500 --> 15:00.000
I'll have you know,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.800
Todd is a very bright spirit
in need of direction.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.500
Mother, it's bad enough
that you're slandering me.

15:05.500 --> 15:09.300
Do you have to commandeer my office
to do your new age coddle session?

15:09.300 --> 15:12.600
Richard, you can't expect me
to pay manhattan rates for office space.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.300
Well, how about this?

15:14.300 --> 15:15.800
You cannot beat this location.

15:15.800 --> 15:19.000
Proximity to beverages
and sharp utensils.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.500
Sweetheart,
as your life coach,

15:21.500 --> 15:25.300
I have to urge you to say nay
to your inner naysayer.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.900
I call that a martha-Ism.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.000
How is it that you don't know
who my father is,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.900
You don't know how your
ex-Husband stole all your money,

15:31.900 --> 15:34.300
Yet you are giving life
coaching advice?

15:34.300 --> 15:37.300
Mistakes are the building
blocks of wisdom.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.500
A martha-Ism.
Besides, freud was an addict.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.500
Didn't stop him
from helping people.

15:42.500 --> 15:47.100
Sadly, faced with his mother's...
twisted yet unimpeachable logic,

15:47.300 --> 15:48.800
Richard castle's
head exploded.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.200
Ah, well.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.500
So why are you home
so early?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.300
Well, thought i'd take
a little breather.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.400
Working on a, uh,
kidnapping case.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.700
A little girl.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.300
No wonder you're so surly.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.200
Those poor parents,
having a child ripped away...

16:04.200 --> 16:05.900
I can't imagine
how they must feel.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.300
Is alexis home?

16:07.400 --> 16:08.800
She's upstairs.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.900
I'm feeling a deep-Seated
need for a hug.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.600
Perfectly understandable.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.900
After all,
we are pod-Mates.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Another martha-Ism.
I call it the peapod bond--

16:18.000 --> 16:20.800
You know, the bond that exists
between parent and child--

16:20.800 --> 16:22.700
You and me,
you and alexis.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.400
We're all peas in a pod,
and whether we like it or not,

16:25.400 --> 16:28.500
Everyone who's ever had a child
is in the pod forever.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.000
The peapod bond.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.500
Alexis!
Thank you, mother.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.300
I'll deduct my session fee
from your rent.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
You might want to consider
the year-Long package.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.200
It's a bargain!

16:44.100 --> 16:45.000
What was that for?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.800
Just a peapod thing.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.300
Gram will explain.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
Hey.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.300
Hey, yourself.
Want some?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.200
Yeah, thanks.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.500
So i just got word
from my guys,

17:03.500 --> 17:05.300
And ellers is a dead end.

17:06.700 --> 17:09.500
The owner over at
paradise diner on east 62nd vouched

17:09.500 --> 17:12.200
That he was having his usual
poached eggs this morning.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.800
Would have been
too easy, right?

17:16.700 --> 17:18.400
Or over easy?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.200
That's like something
castle would say.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.700
You like him.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.200
No, i just, um...

17:35.300 --> 17:36.700
I don't know.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.600
I think he's interesting.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.500
So you're not...

17:41.100 --> 17:43.900
Together? No.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.100
I meant to call.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.300
Must have picked up
the phone a dozen times.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.500
Yeah, i know. You meant
to do a lot of things.

17:57.500 --> 18:01.300
That's why you left,
remember?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.500
Boston was
a great opportunity.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.800
I'm not saying
that it wasn't.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.300
I'm just saying,
it was a choice...

18:09.600 --> 18:11.600
That didn't include me.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.700
You could have come.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.000
And then done what?

18:15.300 --> 18:18.200
Join the boston p.D., and then
you have to move to phoenix

18:18.200 --> 18:19.800
And then cleveland,
and then you're back here?

18:19.800 --> 18:23.200
I mean, we both know what
that life is all about.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.000
Didn't stop me
from missing you,

18:27.600 --> 18:29.300
Missing us.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.000
Sundays in the park...

18:32.100 --> 18:37.000
Those ridiculous neon ice skates
at rockefeller center.

18:38.100 --> 18:42.200
I will have you know that
those ice skates are awesome.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.300
It wasn't the skates.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.800
Will, i--

18:58.400 --> 19:01.100
Oh! I thought cops
and feds hated each other.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.900
They say justice never sleeps.
I think i know why.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.300
- We were just, uh--
- Being consenting adults.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.300
I'm not judging.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.700
I thought i told you
to go home.

19:08.700 --> 19:09.700
I did go home,

19:09.800 --> 19:11.700
But then my mother told me
something that couldn't wait.

19:11.700 --> 19:12.700
You live with your mother?

19:12.700 --> 19:14.100
Yeah, apparently,
we're peas in a pod.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.500
But the important point is,
angela is adopted.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.200
So?

19:17.200 --> 19:19.100
So prior to giving up her baby,

19:19.100 --> 19:21.800
The birth mother would have been
given background on the candelas,

19:21.800 --> 19:24.700
Specifically their ability to
support the child.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.600
Knowledge of their finances.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.200
Really, kate,

19:28.300 --> 19:31.300
We're gonna waste time
on the insights of nancy drew here?

19:31.300 --> 19:33.000
Is that supposed to
be an insult?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.700
Because nancy drew
solved every case.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.500
Look, okay,
and i'm quoting here,

19:37.700 --> 19:40.600
"When a child's life is
at stake, we have to be sure,

19:40.700 --> 19:43.200
Which means we have to question
everything we think we know."

19:43.300 --> 19:45.000
I was a junior
in high school.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.900
What was i gonna do
with a baby?

19:47.300 --> 19:49.500
It's been two years,
miss gomez.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.500
Two years
is still a long time

19:53.500 --> 19:55.800
To think about a decision
you made when you were 16.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.800
What am i doing here?
What is this about?

19:57.800 --> 20:01.200
We're talking about the baby
and your regretting your decision.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.700
My decision?

20:03.500 --> 20:05.300
I don't regret my decision.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.400
Then why did you
try to find her?

20:08.500 --> 20:10.300
What are you
talking about?

20:11.100 --> 20:15.000
This is a petion that you filed with
the adoption agency a couple of months ago.

20:16.100 --> 20:20.500
It's a form requesting the identity
of the adoptive parents of angela.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.000
- A signed form.
- No.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.800
- That's not my signature.
- Lucia, i'm not--

20:25.800 --> 20:28.700
No, really. Look,
you can see for yourself.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.400
That's not my signature.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.800
Why?
What's going on?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.400
What happened to her?

20:37.000 --> 20:37.800
Is she okay?

20:37.800 --> 20:40.700
Did anyone in your family object
to you giving up your baby?

20:40.700 --> 20:43.800
No, no one. My-- My mom
even helped me with it.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.100
And the father?

20:46.200 --> 20:47.400
Juan?

20:49.200 --> 20:51.200
He was in iraq
when i had her,

20:51.300 --> 20:53.200
But we talked about it.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.300
He was cool.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.100
Are you sure about that?

20:58.600 --> 21:00.200
He still in iraq?

21:00.300 --> 21:02.900
No, he got back
a couple months ago.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.100
Juan restrepo?

21:11.800 --> 21:14.200
Nypd. We'd like to
ask you some-- Oh!

21:14.300 --> 21:16.300
Go, go, go, go!
Hey!

21:17.100 --> 21:19.700
Freeze!
Hands up!

21:23.800 --> 21:24.600
Freeze!

21:24.700 --> 21:26.100
Keep your hands up!

21:28.000 --> 21:29.500
On the ground.
On the ground!

21:29.700 --> 21:31.200
Hit the ground!

21:34.300 --> 21:35.500
So why'd you run?

21:35.500 --> 21:36.500
Look,in my neighborhood,

21:36.500 --> 21:38.400
When you see a cop,
that's what you do.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.300
What? No, uh,
good cop/bad fed?

21:45.800 --> 21:47.300
The guy did two tours
in the gulf.

21:47.300 --> 21:50.100
I go over there, he'd turn it
into a pissing match.

21:50.100 --> 21:54.100
But kate, she's got a way
of sneaking up on people.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.800
You mean like
last night?

21:58.300 --> 21:59.200
Can you believe this?

21:59.300 --> 22:01.000
Dude details cars
for a living.

22:01.100 --> 22:03.300
You'd think he'd have
a little more pride in his ride.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.200
I'm just saying,

22:07.800 --> 22:10.100
It looked like
quite a kiss.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.400
- You jealous, castle?
- Me?

22:12.500 --> 22:15.700
No, but you have to admit...
i was right.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.600
You are jealous...
that i hooked her.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.800
What's there to be jealous of?
You couldn't reel her in.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.100
We'll see about that.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.800
I was 18 when lucia
got pregnant.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
Six months in,
i got deployed.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.400
I never even had
the chance to see her.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.100
But you signed
the adoption papers.

22:38.200 --> 22:41.100
You know, when you're over there,
you see so many kids.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.800
I just...

22:43.200 --> 22:44.600
I need to know
she was okay.

22:44.600 --> 22:49.000
I- I filled out the form,
and i put lucia's name instead.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.800
- You got an address.
- Yeah, dude felt bad for me.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.500
He was over there, too,
in gulf one,

22:54.500 --> 22:55.500
And he only lost an arm.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.000
And what did you lose?

22:58.800 --> 23:00.800
An i.E.D.
Hit my humvee.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.500
The shrapnel
tore through the floor.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.800
The doc says i'm never
gonna have kids of my own,

23:05.800 --> 23:07.100
So...

23:07.500 --> 23:10.000
Yeah, i got an address,
and i went to go see my daughter.

23:10.100 --> 23:13.900
So you kidnap her and you ask
her adoptive parents for money?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.500
Wait, "kidnap her"?
She was kidnapped?

23:15.500 --> 23:17.100
And you think
i did that?

23:17.200 --> 23:19.400
All i ever wanted to know
was that she was okay!

23:19.600 --> 23:21.100
Is she?!

23:24.100 --> 23:26.600
Yo. Birth dad?
His story checks out.

23:26.700 --> 23:29.000
Limo company had him doing
their fleet yesterday.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.700
I don't care.
He had motive and opportunity.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.700
His motive was
the instinct of fatherhood.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.000
If he took her,
he'd have been with her,

23:35.000 --> 23:36.800
Not at some $12-An-Hour
detailing job.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.800
Doesn't matter.
I want e.S.U. On his place.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.000
It's not him, will.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
We're at square freakin' one,
and we've got nothing.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.200
You can send e.S.U.
Wherever you want,

23:45.200 --> 23:47.000
But i'm not
losing this one.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.700
What did she mean,
"not losing this one"?

23:53.300 --> 23:55.000
The case we worked.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.000
I thought you got the guy.

23:59.300 --> 24:00.900
We did,
but...

24:01.300 --> 24:03.200
The kid was already dead.

24:08.700 --> 24:09.900
Sorenson.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.400
On my way.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.200
Another call
about the ransom.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.600
They asked for
75 packs of hundreds,

24:17.600 --> 24:20.700
Randomized serial numbers
and warned against bait money,

24:20.700 --> 24:22.300
Dye packs and trackers.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.600
Sounds like
they know your playbook.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.300
They were detailed
down to the make,

24:25.300 --> 24:27.600
Model and color
of the backpack.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.700
Drop instructions?

24:28.700 --> 24:30.000
We wait for their call.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.500
All right,
let's get the money set,

24:31.500 --> 24:33.000
Be ready to
make the drop.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.500
Why didn't they tell us
where to bring the money?

24:35.500 --> 24:37.600
They're testing you.
It's not unusual.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.300
Which means
before we make the drop,

24:39.300 --> 24:40.900
We'll need to test them.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.300
We'll need proof that
they have angela and that she's okay.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.400
What if
they don't give any?

24:46.600 --> 24:48.500
- What if they refuse?
- How can you think that?

24:48.500 --> 24:50.700
- I'm just saying--
- What, you think she's dead?

24:50.700 --> 24:52.800
- No, of course not.
- I should've gotten up.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.300
I shouldn't have
let you watch her.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.200
Don't tell me what to say!

24:56.200 --> 24:58.600
Tell me, alfred,
was it worth it?!

24:58.700 --> 25:01.200
Was it worth
our little girl?!

25:02.600 --> 25:04.200
Oh! Oh, my...

25:12.900 --> 25:14.400
Mrs. Candela?

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
Theresa...

25:17.800 --> 25:20.000
You can't give in
to your fear.

25:20.300 --> 25:24.300
Neither you nor your husband
is responsible for what happened.

25:27.800 --> 25:28.700
Come on.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.700
Remember, no proof, no money.
We need to be firm on that.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.300
Okay?
Here we go.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.200
Hello.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.500
Listen carefully.

25:42.600 --> 25:45.400
Any deviation,
and your daughter dies.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.100
I understand.

25:47.300 --> 25:50.000
A civilian, not a cop,
must make the drop,

25:50.000 --> 25:51.500
Or we kill the girl.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.600
We see police or fbi,
and she dies.

25:54.600 --> 25:58.300
- Do you have the money?
- Yes. 750, like you said.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.800
Put it in the backpack

25:59.800 --> 26:03.500
And bring it to the northeast corner
of 1st avenue and 47th.

26:03.500 --> 26:06.600
There's a mailbox there with
a cell phone taped underneath.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.300
We'll text further instructions
once you're there.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.600
When we have the money,

26:10.600 --> 26:13.000
Then we'll call
with the girl's location.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.500
Ask for proof
that angela's okay.

26:16.100 --> 26:19.800
You won't get any money until
i know my little girl is okay.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.200
Mama?

26:23.800 --> 26:25.700
Hi, sweetheart.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.500
You have one hour.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.300
Once they get paid,
there's no incentive to keep her alive,

26:36.300 --> 26:37.800
So i'll make the drop.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.600
Figure, we'll place our people
at a 1-Block radius from the mailbox.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.700
No.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.100
They said no cops.

26:44.300 --> 26:46.500
It's okay.
I've done this before.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.000
And they won't know
i'm an fbi agent.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.500
And if they do?

26:49.600 --> 26:52.500
Mr. Candela, we need this
to go as smoothly as possible.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.100
She's my daughter,

26:54.100 --> 26:56.600
And we're gonna follow their
instructions to the letter.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.700
They said no cops.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.700
Look, i'm her father,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
And i can do this.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.900
Do i make myself clear?

27:19.500 --> 27:21.400
No way we can send
the father.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.600
Too many things could go wrong.
He's too emotional.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.100
What choice do we have?

27:25.100 --> 27:27.200
- Me.
- What?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.100
I'm not a cop.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.300
I'm certainly not emotional.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.800
No.
Absolutely not.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.000
The nypd already has
a signed waiver from me,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.400
And i don't like saying this,

27:38.500 --> 27:39.600
But you're running out of time.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.000
Castle's right.

27:41.100 --> 27:42.000
You can't be serious.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
He's been with me
on cases before.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.500
He's good under pressure.

27:46.300 --> 27:49.000
And he's our best shot.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.500
Okay, so this
is usually the part

28:18.500 --> 28:20.400
Where i ask if you've
thought this through,

28:20.400 --> 28:22.900
And then i rembered,
you don't think things through.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.800
Cold hands,
cold hands.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.000
These people
are dangerous, castle.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.500
You need to stay alert
and focused.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.500
Alert and focused,
got it.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.800
Maybe if--Maybe if you just rubbed 'em
together for a second.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.100
Wait, wait.
Alert and what?

28:37.300 --> 28:38.400
I'm just kidding.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.200
- You're good to go.
- Thanks.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.200
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

28:45.100 --> 28:49.000
Look, about... last night,
what happened in the kitchen,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.100
- I- I just--
- Oh, listen,

28:50.100 --> 28:51.300
You don't need to
explain that.

28:51.300 --> 28:52.600
- That's--
- I don't?

28:52.600 --> 28:53.800
Unless you want to.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.800
Uh, no, you know,
i ju-- I just figured,

28:56.800 --> 28:58.800
For the character,
for nikki heat--

28:58.800 --> 29:01.000
Yeah, you-- I think--
I think understand nikki heat

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Better than you think
i do.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.000
Be careful, okay?

29:11.800 --> 29:14.300
Do i detect actual concern
for my well-Being?

29:14.300 --> 29:15.900
Screw this up,
and i'll kill you.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.900
That's more like it.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.100
Okay, i have eyes
on the target. Over.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.600
Are you reading me?

29:27.600 --> 29:28.800
We don't have to
read you.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.300
We can see you.
Now shut up and focus.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.500
Roger that.
Five by five.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.400
He's quite a guy.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.300
If he only knew how big
a fan you really are.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.400
Yeah, well,
he's not going to know.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.000
You never told him how you
stood in line for an hour

29:44.000 --> 29:45.500
Just to get
your book signed...

29:47.300 --> 29:50.200
How his novels got you
through your mother's death?

29:51.000 --> 29:52.700
Is there anything
you don't remember?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.500
Not when it
comes to you.

30:07.300 --> 30:11.500
I feel like michael finding
the gun taped behind the toilet.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.100
Uh...

30:14.300 --> 30:17.600
You might want to tell ryan
and esposito to hang back.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.300
They just sent a text.
It says, "we're watching you."

30:20.800 --> 30:22.100
It could be
just a ruse.

30:22.800 --> 30:23.700
Nope.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.600
They just sent
another one.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.900
It says, "you're wearing
a black raincoat."

30:28.500 --> 30:31.700
Okay, so they can see you.
That doesn't change anything.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.600
Tell him to
stop fooling around.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.100
Like that'll help.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.600
Okay...

30:46.000 --> 30:49.400
It says,
"cross the street,

30:50.100 --> 30:52.500
And head west
on east 47th."

30:53.100 --> 30:54.400
That's left, right?

30:54.500 --> 30:55.300
Right.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.100
Right, right?
Or right, left?

30:57.100 --> 30:58.600
- Left.
- Left.

31:01.300 --> 31:04.200
"1201 1st."
That's just ahead.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.900
Got it.
We see him.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.800
They want me to leave the bag
at the shoeshine stand

31:16.800 --> 31:19.000
And exit out the side.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.100
All right.
I'm at the stand.

31:31.300 --> 31:32.600
Then have him
make the drop.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.400
Castle,
leave the bag.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.500
Make the drop
and walk away.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.500
Coming in.
Don't have him yet.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.800
I just left it.
I'm headed out.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.100
Esposito, ryan...
you got eyes?

31:47.300 --> 31:49.000
I see the shoeshine stand.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.000
Wait.
I got the backpack.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.500
Asian male... long hair.
I got him, i got him!

31:55.600 --> 31:57.800
Where's the girl?
Where's angela?

31:57.800 --> 31:58.800
What girl?

31:58.900 --> 32:00.900
I don't know
what you're talking about!

32:05.800 --> 32:07.500
Ryan!
Ryan!

32:19.700 --> 32:22.300
The kidnappers
posted an ad on craigslist

32:22.300 --> 32:25.800
And said that this was
a performance art piece for youtube.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.100
They sent out nearly
two dozen of the backpacks.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.600
The poster used
an i.P. Anonymizer,

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
Making it impossible
to trace.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.600
So we just do nothing?

32:34.800 --> 32:37.000
Well, i managed to¡ìslip the phone

32:37.000 --> 32:39.100
That the kidnappers
gave me inside the backpack.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.500
I don't understand.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.500
Well, before i did that,

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
I sent a text message
to detective beckett.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.000
The phone's under
a bulk account,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.100
So we can't trace
its owner,

32:46.100 --> 32:47.600
But we can trace its i.D.

32:47.600 --> 32:51.300
So far, we've pinged the phone to
a 20-Block radius on the lower east side.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.800
We'll need another few hours
to narrow it down.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.100
In the meantime, i've moved
a team into the area.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.800
They'll work the streets,
be ready to move

32:57.800 --> 32:59.700
When we have
more information.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.300
- Thanks.
- Mm-Hmm.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.200
You okay?

33:18.500 --> 33:21.200
I keep thinking, if only i saw
who took that bag...

33:21.600 --> 33:23.400
Well, that wasn't
your job.

33:28.100 --> 33:31.400
You know, i can't imagine anything
like this ever happening to alexis.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.100
We'll get her
back soon.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.100
Not as soon as we hoped.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.500
They must've found it,
taken the batteries out.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.100
We just lost the signal
from the phone.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.000
Hey.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.400
Hey...

34:09.600 --> 34:11.900
What are you doing up?
Stressed about finals?

34:12.100 --> 34:14.199
American lit's today.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.500
I was having nightmares
about hester prynne.

34:18.600 --> 34:21.900
The irony for you is not getting
an "a" would cause you shame.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.600
So why are you up?

34:23.699 --> 34:25.900
Looking for a white rabbit.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.800
Lewis carroll
or "the matrix"?

34:27.800 --> 34:29.500
I'm not sure yet.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.400
What did beckett tell you about
taking phone photos at the crime scene?

34:33.600 --> 34:35.699
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

34:37.100 --> 34:39.400
See all those stuffed
animals on the bed?

34:40.400 --> 34:42.400
It looks just like
mine used to.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.300
Remember when i had
all those animals?

34:44.400 --> 34:46.500
If by rember when,
" you mean monkey-Bonkey,

34:46.500 --> 34:48.900
Who has been washed so many times
he looks like roadkill now,

34:48.900 --> 34:49.500
Then, yes.

34:49.500 --> 34:50.900
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:50.900 --> 34:52.400
Oh, then you won't mind
next time i see him

34:52.400 --> 34:54.699
- If i throw him out.
- Don't you dare!

34:55.000 --> 34:56.400
- I won't, i won't.
- Don't.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.500
- I won't.
- Okay.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.600
Okay.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.700
So you think the bunny has
something to do with the case?

35:05.000 --> 35:07.700
I'll let you know when
i go down the rabbit hole.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.000
Castle?

35:18.700 --> 35:19.900
Go back to sleep.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.600
What are you doing?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.500
When alexis was little,

35:23.600 --> 35:26.900
She had a stuffed monkey that
she could not live without.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.200
One time we went on vacation,
she forgot to pack him.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.200
I bought her another one,

35:30.200 --> 35:32.500
But she knew it was
not monkey-Bonkey.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.500
So?

35:33.600 --> 35:38.600
So there's two more pictures of
her clutching this bunny out there.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.300
So where's the bunny?

35:40.500 --> 35:44.100
You think whoever took angela knew
her well enough to take the bunny, too?

35:44.500 --> 35:46.600
But we already checked
the candelas' list.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.400
A couple of teenage babysitters,

35:48.400 --> 35:50.400
A cleaning lady...
they've all been cleared.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.200
Only not all babysitters are teenagers.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.600
Sometimes they're people
close to us.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.400
Sometimes they're family.

35:58.900 --> 36:00.200
When did we lose the signal
on the phone?

36:00.200 --> 36:03.500
Right after we told the candelas
we were tracking it.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.600
Theresa's sister nina--
You got an address?

36:17.600 --> 36:18.900
Nina mendoza,

36:19.100 --> 36:22.100
You're under arrest for
the kidnapping of angela candela.

36:22.200 --> 36:25.000
Taking your own niece?
Put your hands behind your back.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.000
You have the right
to remain silent...

36:27.200 --> 36:28.400
Hello, angela,

36:28.700 --> 36:30.800
I am so happy
to see you.

36:30.900 --> 36:32.500
You wanna go and see mommy?

36:33.100 --> 36:36.900
Come on, baby.
Look at you. Hello.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.200
Hi, beautiful.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.100
You wanna grab your pink rabbit?
Oh, look at the rabbit.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.900
Oh, my god.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.800
Angie!

37:02.900 --> 37:05.700
Mi coraz?N.Mwah!

37:06.100 --> 37:09.700
Oh! Oh! Oh! God.
You look perfect.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.900
Just... perfect!

37:11.900 --> 37:13.800
- Is she okay?
- She's fine. Yeah.

37:14.200 --> 37:17.200
Honey...
what are you doing?

37:17.600 --> 37:19.600
She's here!
She's home!

37:22.400 --> 37:24.300
What is it?
What's wrong?

37:34.400 --> 37:36.000
What's going on?

37:36.700 --> 37:40.600
Crawford...
can you take angela?

37:44.700 --> 37:46.200
Come here,
sweetie.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.600
- Here you go, crawford.
- Thank you. Here we go.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.600
What did you do?

37:58.400 --> 38:01.200
I worked 14-Hour days,
year after year,

38:01.200 --> 38:03.800
Killing myself so that
we can have a life.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.100
And what did you do?

38:07.000 --> 38:08.900
Oh.
You painted.

38:09.500 --> 38:10.900
All you did was paint.

38:10.900 --> 38:13.000
- That's not true.
- Really?

38:13.100 --> 38:14.900
What about that job
you said that you were gonna get

38:14.900 --> 38:16.100
So that i could cut my hours?

38:16.100 --> 38:17.700
I was taking care of angela!

38:17.700 --> 38:20.900
Taking care?
You left her there...

38:21.000 --> 38:23.800
In front of the tv
every day!

38:24.500 --> 38:27.500
Do you know how many times
i woke up to her screams,

38:27.500 --> 38:30.500
Because he was in that room
blasting the music in his ears?

38:30.500 --> 38:32.900
It doesn't give you the right
to kidnap your own child.

38:32.900 --> 38:35.700
How is it kidnapping?
She's my daughter.

38:35.700 --> 38:39.400
Mrs. Candela, you had your sister climb
through that window and take her.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.800
I gave her permission.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.100
It doesn't matter.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.800
You violated your husband's
custodial rights.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.900
Custodial rights?

38:49.000 --> 38:51.800
He didn't even notice
that she was gone!

38:52.100 --> 38:55.700
What kind of a father does that
to his 2-Year-Old child?

38:55.700 --> 38:57.400
Why would you do this?

38:57.400 --> 38:59.800
Why would you put us
through that?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.100
I mean, for god sake,
why not just divorce me?

39:02.100 --> 39:04.900
Oh, so that you can sue me
for alimony?

39:05.400 --> 39:07.900
So that you can get half
of everything?

39:08.100 --> 39:11.400
So that you can get custody
of angela

39:11.600 --> 39:15.900
Because i'm at work all day
and you can "be there for her"?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.200
No.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.600
I've seen what happens
to the guys at work,

39:19.600 --> 39:21.100
What happened to doug ellers.

39:21.200 --> 39:24.100
No way was that
gonna happen to me!

39:24.400 --> 39:26.800
You were paying the ransom
to yourself.

39:30.400 --> 39:35.800
Once angela returned,
i would file for the papers.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.500
There would be nothing left
for him to take.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.700
And if angela was kidnapped

39:39.700 --> 39:41.700
When alfred was
taking care of her, then--

39:41.700 --> 39:42.400
The lawyer said that

39:42.400 --> 39:46.000
If i could prove him negligent,
i would get custody.

39:46.100 --> 39:49.200
I wouldn't have to move out
of the apartment that i paid for

39:49.200 --> 39:52.500
So that he could live here
with my daughter.

39:53.500 --> 39:57.400
Do you know
how hard it was to adopt her,

39:57.600 --> 40:00.000
How much it cost?

40:00.100 --> 40:02.000
Ten years!

40:02.400 --> 40:06.900
How many paintings
have you sold, alfred? Huh?

40:07.400 --> 40:09.200
How many?

40:12.200 --> 40:14.700
How could you
hate me so much?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.200
You made it easy.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.700
So how do you think
she'll do?

40:33.200 --> 40:35.700
Well, it depends on how many
mothers are on the jury.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.200
So...

40:38.900 --> 40:41.000
Now that it's over...

40:42.200 --> 40:44.500
Now that i'm back,
i was...

40:45.000 --> 40:47.600
Thinking maybe we could
give it another shot.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.300
And when you leave again?

40:51.200 --> 40:52.900
You come with me.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.500
Think about it.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.500
Nice guy.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.100
I can see how
it wouldn't work, though.

41:21.700 --> 41:23.700
- Really?
- Sure.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.900
Handsome, square-Jawed,
by-The-Book...

41:27.900 --> 41:29.300
And that's a bad thing?

41:29.400 --> 41:30.800
Yeah, he's like
the male you.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.700
Yin needs yang,
not another yin.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.000
"Yin-Yang" is harmony.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.700
"Yin-Yin" is...
a name for a panda.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.100
Any more wisdom,
obi-Wan?

41:42.100 --> 41:43.900
Nope,
that's it for today.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
What say we celebrate
by going out for a drink?

41:46.000 --> 41:47.900
I can't.
I got a date.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.500
A date?
You date?

41:50.900 --> 41:51.800
Who?

41:52.200 --> 41:54.100
That's why it's called
a "private life,"

41:54.100 --> 41:55.600
Because it's private.

41:55.700 --> 41:58.300
Unlike you, i don't live
my life on "page six."

42:00.400 --> 42:02.800
Well, you're a mysterious woman,
detective beckett.

42:02.900 --> 42:06.000
Maybe there's a little more
nikki heat in me than you think.
