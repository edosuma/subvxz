The Closer

00:07.970 --> 00:15.960
Season 03

00:15.970 --> 00:18.790
Episode 14-15

00:18.970 --> 00:20.820
Brenda, is something wrong?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.350
This is ridiculous.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.960
Our real-estate agent said
it would help sell the hse --

00:24.970 --> 00:27.150
give it a "home for the holidays" vibe.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.050
We both know gary doesn't lie.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.520
Gary.

00:31.830 --> 00:33.300
He hadn't brought us an
offer in three months.

00:33.310 --> 00:35.020
Suddenly, he calls out of the blue

00:35.030 --> 00:39.810
and we're supposed to hop to
because he has the buyer again.

00:39.820 --> 00:42.070
Brenda, if you don't want to
show the house, just say so.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.050
*********

00:43.060 --> 00:46.230
I just don't want to waste the whole
day decorating it for one couple.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.100
Is it really so terrible to have
the house feeling a little festive?

00:50.110 --> 00:53.160
I do not like it when
I'm ordered to be festive.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.970
Just hand me the damn angel.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.130
Thanks.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.480
Brenda, be merry.

01:11.490 --> 01:12.890
I am merry.

01:13.190 --> 01:15.870
Merry, merry, merry, merry, merry.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.050
Merry christmas!

01:18.330 --> 01:19.580
Brenda.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.610
- Welcome.
- Come on in.

01:24.510 --> 01:25.520
Baby.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.800 --> 01:40.430
- Oh, no, please.
- It's all right.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.600
You a baseball fan?

01:41.610 --> 01:44.340
Huge. We collect vintage jerseys.

01:45.410 --> 01:47.150
Is the neighborhood safe?

01:47.290 --> 01:47.790
Well
--

01:47.800 --> 01:49.820
oh, uh, no, no.Very safe.

01:49.830 --> 01:52.850
In fact, fritz and brenda were just
getting ready to take a little stroll.

01:52.860 --> 01:54.430
- Right, fritz?
- Right.Sorry.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.590
- Have fun.
- See you lateR.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.090
They're nice.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.800
- Go ahead.Have a look around.
- Yeah.

02:15.810 --> 02:17.630
It's charming, though, right?

02:17.640 --> 02:19.080
Gary doesn't lie.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.010
Or you could just blow all this out.

02:23.340 --> 02:26.730
Yes, chief, I know exactly
where that is. Thank you.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.500
Sorry.

02:29.130 --> 02:32.720
There's been a robbery
and a homicide --

02:32.730 --> 02:33.930
well, two homicides.

02:33.940 --> 02:37.300
Not near here -- far,
far, far, far away.

02:37.310 --> 02:38.590
Not too faR.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.970
Thank y'all.Nice meeting you.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.480
Hey, wait till you see the kitchen, huh?

02:47.490 --> 02:49.240
You guys hungry? Come on.

03:12.490 --> 03:13.960
So, where is the third guy?

03:13.970 --> 03:16.960
And why do they
come he-- Damn.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.330
Boss, here they come.

03:21.670 --> 03:22.910
Who called 'em?

03:22.920 --> 03:24.440
I got no clue.

03:29.770 --> 03:33.420
I was five brats away from getting
my grandson a photo with santa,

03:33.430 --> 03:34.850
so this better be good.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.180
What happened to your hand?

03:39.190 --> 03:41.610
Well, my 6-year-old
-- it's a long story.

03:42.060 --> 03:44.550
Deputy chief johnson, good to see you.

03:45.430 --> 03:46.190
Chief pope.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.900
I want everyone watching to see that we
have this investigation under control,

03:48.910 --> 03:51.650
so if you'll both just
please nod, like we all agree.

03:51.660 --> 03:54.710
Excellent. Now, commander taylor, was
this robbery the work of the same crew

03:54.720 --> 03:57.080
that you've been tracking
since last january?

03:57.090 --> 03:59.310
Looks like the same M.O.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.320
Walk up, ski masks, drive away.

04:02.330 --> 04:04.750
But this firepower --
that's not their style.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.380
Seems to have escalated.

04:06.390 --> 04:07.770
Well, so have I.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.170
Priority homicide is gonna
take the lead on this case now.

04:10.180 --> 04:13.350
Ross: We've been busting our asses
on this investigation for 11 months.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.120
Are you suggesting that 11 months of failure
is an argument for your remaining on the case?

04:17.130 --> 04:20.680
Chief, it would take a lot of time to
bring priority homicide up to speed.

04:20.690 --> 04:23.620
Chief pope, perhaps commander taylor
and i could split the investigation.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.980
- I could cover the homicide.
- Chief johnson,

04:25.990 --> 04:27.730
I appreciate the good intentions,

04:27.740 --> 04:29.920
but this investigation
covers a lot of ground.

04:29.930 --> 04:32.610
Now, I really want to
be a team player here.

04:32.620 --> 04:33.940
Then be one.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.480
- Chief...
- commander...

04:35.490 --> 04:38.930
sometimes, being a team player
means sitting on the bench.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.110
- Progress.
- Yes, siR.

04:42.660 --> 04:45.810
- Sorry, commandeR.
- Don'T.Please.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.830
Gentlemen, with me, please.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.360
This scene is ours.

04:50.370 --> 04:51.840
Hey, I don't think this is settled.

04:51.850 --> 04:53.590
Uh, I'm afraid it is.

05:10.330 --> 05:11.790
Talked to the bank manageR.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.470
Cash cargo is extra
high at the holidays.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.480
They're still doing inventory,
but the bank estimates that

05:17.490 --> 05:20.000
the suspects drove off
with close to 150 grand.

05:20.010 --> 05:20.820
Can we trace it?

05:20.830 --> 05:22.760
No. No dyes.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.880
Now, don't ask me why,
but for some reason,

05:24.890 --> 05:29.380
the policy is to use markers and
dyes after a bank has been robbed.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.080
Oh, for heaven's sake.

05:33.610 --> 05:34.500
Okay.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.120
Let's get pickup
schedules --

05:36.130 --> 05:38.920
dates, times, routes --
from tas armored cars.

05:39.220 --> 05:41.660
Why this bank? Why this route?

05:42.080 --> 05:42.970
Anything on the weapons?

05:42.980 --> 05:46.420
Lots of casings, probably semiautomatic
pistols, something uzi-esque --

05:46.430 --> 05:49.930
easier to conceal, powerful
enough to penetrate a vest.

05:49.940 --> 05:51.210
Might be gang-related.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.190
They don't mind shooting people.

05:53.530 --> 05:54.600
Poor bastard.

05:54.610 --> 05:57.040
$10 an hour for this.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.050
Provenza: No time to get his gloves off.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.630
Even if he could get to his gun,

06:01.640 --> 06:04.500
he's got a six-shooter against
guys with assault weapons.

06:04.510 --> 06:07.300
We're not the only
ones that are outgunned.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.720
Okay, who wants to notify the families?

06:16.150 --> 06:17.860
Thank you, lieutenant.

06:18.820 --> 06:19.720
Lieutenant provenza,

06:19.730 --> 06:22.090
have tas provide us with
their employee backgrounds.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.180
Same goes for the bank.

06:23.190 --> 06:26.210
See if anyone has a bumpy past
or knew these guards personally.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.150
These are usually inside jobs.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.570
Taylor's men have anything to say?

06:29.580 --> 06:32.150
Uh, mostly stuff I'd rather not repeat,

06:32.160 --> 06:35.650
except this crew they've been searching
for used to be a three-person operation,

06:35.660 --> 06:37.120
but today there was only two.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.780
Don't know what they
did with the third guy.

06:38.790 --> 06:39.530
Witnesses?

06:39.540 --> 06:43.160
The wounded guard in the
ambulance is wesley reed.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.440
Three customers in the parking lot
all pretty much say the same thing --

06:46.450 --> 06:48.350
two men in boots, jeans, jackets,

06:48.360 --> 06:51.830
and ski masks approached the vehicle
while the guards were unloading.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.020
Everyone pretty much hit the
deck when the shots were fired,

06:54.030 --> 06:58.770
and a couple people said our bad guys
fled the scene in an old chevy astro van.

06:58.780 --> 06:59.590
Okay.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.930
Lieutenant tao, please
compile a list of stolen cars,

07:02.940 --> 07:04.910
"a" to "z," in the last 12 months.

07:05.080 --> 07:09.190
They must have had a drop-off
car -- Wait, wait!....

07:14.420 --> 07:15.260
Can I go home?

07:15.270 --> 07:16.520
I really just want to go home.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.040
They need to take you to the E.R.,

07:18.050 --> 07:19.260
Make sure you're okay.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.640
You got grazed by a bullet.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.000
I don't have any health insurance.

07:22.010 --> 07:23.210
Don't -- don't
worry, wesley.

07:23.220 --> 07:24.280
We'll take care of that.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.380
But first, I need to know what you saw.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.410
Anything might help.

07:31.070 --> 07:33.330
Uh, arnie and hayes
were unloading the truck,

07:34.180 --> 07:36.630
and out of nowhere, my
windshield gets sprayed.

07:36.990 --> 07:37.880
I heard yelling.

07:37.890 --> 07:40.820
It was arnie telling me
to stay inside, but I --

07:41.560 --> 07:43.820
I got out and went for my gun.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.340
Bullets were flying everywhere,

07:45.350 --> 07:47.930
so I dove under the truck for coveR.

07:48.410 --> 07:51.560
And then, uh, I saw, uh...

07:53.180 --> 07:55.100
well, I saw arnie...

07:57.130 --> 07:58.890
oh, man. Oh, man.

07:58.900 --> 08:02.130
Okay, okay. You just rest, okay?

08:02.540 --> 08:04.260
We'll talk lateR.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.970
What -- what
about hayes?

08:22.110 --> 08:25.190
The drop-off was early, according
to the tas armored car supervisoR.

08:25.200 --> 08:29.380
The truck arrived at the la brea
branch 12 minutes ahead of schedule.

08:29.850 --> 08:32.840
Late, maybe, but early,
in holiday traffic?

08:32.850 --> 08:35.870
So the truck was early, but they
were still waiting for it anyway?

08:35.880 --> 08:38.630
And the bank's a good choice
because two right turns,

08:38.640 --> 08:40.549
and, boom, you're on the freeway.

08:40.559 --> 08:44.049
I spoke with the gang task
force, but there's nothing.

08:44.059 --> 08:46.280
Any luck on our getaway van?

08:46.290 --> 08:51.150
Uh, year to date, 12,248
vehicles have been stolen in L.A.

08:51.160 --> 08:57.560
Of which 2,472 are vans,
of which 961 are chevy vans.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.370
Did you find the one we're looking for?

08:59.380 --> 08:59.890
No, ma'am.

08:59.900 --> 09:03.630
Well, we can't rule out the possibility
that our victims may have been involved.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.540
So we should check out all phone
activity between the tas guards,

09:06.550 --> 09:08.120
all the phone lines at la brea,

09:08.130 --> 09:10.690
the personal phones and
cellphones of the manager and --

09:10.700 --> 09:13.120
chief, we get it
-- dump the phones.

09:13.130 --> 09:13.860
Right

09:13.870 --> 09:16.930
Chief, our dead guards seemed
like good guys -- no priors.

09:16.940 --> 09:19.860
Arnie leaves behind a
family of five, grandkids.

09:19.870 --> 09:22.510
Hayes was an only child,
lived with his motheR.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.160
He wanted to be a real cop,
even applied to the academy.

09:31.510 --> 09:33.890
And what about the driver, wesley reed?

09:33.900 --> 09:35.160
Talked to his boss.

09:35.430 --> 09:37.320
Wesley joined tas
about eight months ago.

09:37.330 --> 09:38.980
He was well-liked. No family.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.470
Company insists they don't hire
anyone with a police record,

09:41.480 --> 09:44.810
and they require all
applicants to take a polygraph.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.860
And, uh, taylor's report says that

09:46.870 --> 09:50.260
this crew has been hitting all
security companies, not just tas.

09:51.620 --> 09:54.040
If they're hitting other
security companies...

09:54.400 --> 09:57.750
the last two jobs have been tas trucks,

09:57.760 --> 10:02.070
and they pulled in considerably more money
on those jobs than the ones they did before.

10:02.730 --> 10:04.700
Their information
must be getting betteR.

10:04.710 --> 10:05.810
Add today's robbery,

10:05.820 --> 10:08.150
and it just isn't a coincidence anymore.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.330
It's a pattern.

10:10.460 --> 10:13.350
They once were a three-man crew.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.250
Now they're two.

10:15.260 --> 10:16.450
You know what?

10:16.460 --> 10:18.660
I'd like to chat with
this wesley reed again.

10:18.670 --> 10:21.290
Um, that might not be so simple.

10:21.300 --> 10:25.140
Wesley was sent down to radiology to see
if the bullet that grazed him hit a bone.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.370
Never showed up.

10:26.380 --> 10:27.550
Why not?

10:27.560 --> 10:28.870
Where'd he go?

10:28.880 --> 10:30.310
It's uncleaR.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.760
Well, where does he live?

10:46.280 --> 10:48.130
Any sign of anything?

10:48.140 --> 10:49.120
Negative.

10:49.740 --> 10:53.140
Commander taylor was supposed to
post an officer at the hospital.

10:53.410 --> 10:56.750
He says he did, and
he says he was sorry.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.580
Then he went on to explain
how it wasn't his fault.

10:59.590 --> 11:01.780
Master of the non-apology.

11:10.460 --> 11:11.850
That's wesley's apartment.

11:11.860 --> 11:14.650
Lieutenant flynn, did you see anyone
enter from the rear of the building?

11:14.890 --> 11:15.800
Nothing, no.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.860
Let's make progress.

11:28.030 --> 11:29.950
Police! Freeze!

11:29.960 --> 11:32.970
He's going out back! He's going
out back!He's going out back!

11:44.910 --> 11:47.800
Stop!Wesley, son of a bitch.

11:48.270 --> 11:50.190
Stop! Don't move!

11:51.680 --> 11:53.090
Get on the ground!

11:53.920 --> 11:55.750
Get on the ground!

11:56.150 --> 11:58.770
Get on the ground!
Hands behind your back!

12:01.730 --> 12:03.520
Tell the chief we got him.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.310
Let's go

12:05.950 --> 12:07.780
Get up********

12:07.790 --> 12:08.760
Who the hell are you?

12:19.630 --> 12:21.740
No I.D.Found on the boy, and so far,

12:21.750 --> 12:24.090
he's only opened his mouth
to say that he's not talking.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.870
And as for wesley, his picture's
on every patrolman's dashboard,

12:26.880 --> 12:28.120
but there's no sign of him.

12:28.130 --> 12:31.400
Okay, I do not want a word of
this investigation in the papers,

12:31.410 --> 12:33.390
on tv, or in a blog.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.000
We cannot let wesley reed know
that we are looking for him.

12:36.350 --> 12:38.960
Wherever he is, he must have turned off
his cellphone and taken the battery out,

12:38.970 --> 12:41.080
'cause we've been
pinging it, and nothing.

12:41.090 --> 12:42.500
Same with credit-card activity.

12:42.510 --> 12:45.580
And it turns out wesley boy
does have an arrest record.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.380
Now, tas either missed it,
or they just didn't care.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.760
Doesn't amount to a lot, but, still,

12:50.770 --> 12:55.410
probation for marijuana possession and one
drunk-and-disorderly a couple years back.

12:55.420 --> 12:56.750
Any family?

12:56.760 --> 12:57.330
No.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.760
Does it list known associates?

12:58.770 --> 12:59.430
Uh, no.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.990
- What about the getaway car, the astro van?
- No.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.020
What about the airports?

13:03.030 --> 13:05.230
And that is not a
yes-or-no question.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.470
Lax, burbank,
ontario, long beach --

13:07.480 --> 13:10.460
none of them has sold a ticket
to a wesley, wes, or W.Reed.

13:10.470 --> 13:11.730
So unless he's got
a good fake I.D.--

13:11.740 --> 13:13.910
Or he took a bus or a train.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.240
I was just getting ready
to go down to union station.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.520
Really? When?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.530
See you.

13:18.540 --> 13:19.480
Thank you.

13:19.890 --> 13:23.480
Lieutenant provenza, if you could continue
checking through those phone records.

13:23.490 --> 13:25.940
Lieutenant flynn, if you could
check with the car-rental companies,

13:25.950 --> 13:28.650
and then you can get some help
canvassing the bus stations.

13:28.660 --> 13:30.440
The harder it is to
find this wesley reed,

13:30.450 --> 13:32.910
the more convinced I am
that he's worth looking foR.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.080
Thank you.

13:44.660 --> 13:47.140
You needed a full
S.I.S.Operation for opie?

13:47.150 --> 13:50.460
We were expecting someone
a little more... dangerous.

13:50.470 --> 13:52.420
I'm hoping this boy will lead us to him.

13:52.430 --> 13:56.350
If we had staked the place out a while
longer, maybe wesley might have come back.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.970
By "a while longer," you
mean another 11 months?

13:59.220 --> 14:00.650
Why do you think this kid's involved?

14:00.660 --> 14:03.060
Because... he ran.

14:09.120 --> 14:09.640
Okay.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.650
I told you that I'd
sell your house, right?

14:11.660 --> 14:12.890
Well, gary
doesn't --

14:12.900 --> 14:14.930
- gary, please.
- Okay.

14:14.940 --> 14:17.530
Despite your best attempts
to undermine my salesmanship,

14:17.820 --> 14:22.380
I have managed to persuade brett
and geoffrey to make you an offeR.

14:23.590 --> 14:24.610
Can we talk about this later?

14:24.620 --> 14:26.640
Very short conversation.

14:26.650 --> 14:28.720
I tell you the offer, you say "yes."

14:28.730 --> 14:31.170
$20,000 over the asking price.

14:31.180 --> 14:32.280
Short escrow.

14:32.290 --> 14:36.580
The only catch is, they want you
to include the baseball pyramid.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.650
Fritz's baseball thingy?

14:38.660 --> 14:40.090
I can't ask you to part with that.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.880
For $20,000 over asking,
I would part with you.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.420
Look, I cannot make
a decision right now.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.430
- I have an interview.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.230
You've been trying to get an
offer like this for three months.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.550
Just think what you can do
with 20,000 extra dollars.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.440
Just wait in my office, please.

14:59.470 --> 15:01.490
- Wait....
- Gary, gary, gary.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.310
She's trying to kill me.

15:05.350 --> 15:07.150
Hey, good job just standing there.

15:11.790 --> 15:12.740
You all right in here?

15:12.750 --> 15:14.170
You want something to eat?

15:14.180 --> 15:16.090
No, ma'am. I'm all right.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.070
Well, well, well.

15:21.510 --> 15:25.020
If I hadn't seen you running down the
streets of los angeles with my own eyes,

15:25.030 --> 15:27.240
I'd swear you were a georgia boy.

15:32.310 --> 15:33.490
I'm brenda.

15:35.610 --> 15:37.410
I miss hearing that accent.

15:40.130 --> 15:41.960
Say something southern.

15:43.060 --> 15:45.050
Well, uh, what do you want me to say?

15:45.060 --> 15:46.490
Oh, I don't know.

15:46.500 --> 15:50.180
Something about kudzu or peachtree.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.040
when in rome, do as you
done in milledgeville.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.910
I don't know that one, but I like it.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.930
That's, uh, it's flannery o'connoR.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.780
The writer?

16:03.790 --> 16:05.380
Well, not the nascar driveR.

16:07.270 --> 16:08.840
Oh, that's funny, richard.

16:09.650 --> 16:11.600
Uh, it's --
it's "grady."

16:11.610 --> 16:13.990
Right. Sorry.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.060
You remind me of my brother richard.

16:16.070 --> 16:18.030
"Grady." At least we know
his first name is grady.

16:18.040 --> 16:21.250
It's not as if I don't know
who flannery o'connor is.

16:21.260 --> 16:23.320
I'm just not that
familiar with her work.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.060
Well, that's a shame. She's awesome.

16:25.070 --> 16:27.040
You study her in high school?

16:27.050 --> 16:28.000
I went to roswell.

16:28.010 --> 16:30.410
Oh, I went to chamblee.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.730
"Went"?

16:33.740 --> 16:35.840
I graduated last yeaR.

16:35.850 --> 16:38.510
Buzz, find out where that high
school is and if he attended.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.380
Yes, siR.

16:39.390 --> 16:41.080
What --
at 14?

16:41.690 --> 16:44.000
15 -- I'm
almost 16 now.

16:44.650 --> 16:47.010
Uh, do you spell "chamblee"
with an "s-h" or a "c-h"?

16:47.020 --> 16:48.110
Who knows?

16:48.120 --> 16:49.510
It's georgia.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.460
You still got that great accent.

16:52.670 --> 16:55.370
Wes' accent isn't as strong as yours.

16:55.380 --> 17:01.200
No, he, uh, he moved out here just after
our mom died, took some acting classes.

17:01.210 --> 17:03.760
He's -- he's gonna be in
some commercials, maybe.

17:05.369 --> 17:08.660
I stayed back home in
georgia with my grandma.

17:10.569 --> 17:11.329
You know, it's funny.

17:12.520 --> 17:17.240
I don't even notice my accent, but people
in los angeles think I sound like a hick.

17:17.819 --> 17:18.839
I hear you.

17:18.849 --> 17:22.280
Then I flash 'em my badge, and
they kind of change their tune.

17:23.290 --> 17:25.490
I'm a deputy chief, grady,

17:25.810 --> 17:28.390
and I hope to goodness you
haven't done anything wrong.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.640
I need to ask you some questions.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.430
We found this in your apartment.

17:38.770 --> 17:39.500
What?

17:41.250 --> 17:42.050
Where?

17:42.060 --> 17:43.420
In your bedroom.

17:43.660 --> 17:45.850
- Is that why you ran, grady?
- No, no.That's not my bedroom.

17:45.860 --> 17:46.720
I sleep on the pullout.

17:46.730 --> 17:48.420
So what's wesley doing
with all that cash?

17:48.430 --> 17:49.620
Did your brother do something bad?

17:49.630 --> 17:50.530
No. No, no, no.

17:50.540 --> 17:54.180
That's probably the money he's
saving up for me to go to college.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.210
Do you know two of wesley's co-workers
were shot and killed yesterday?

17:58.220 --> 17:59.240
He didn't kill anybody.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.910
The sooner we talk, the sooner
we can ensure his safety,

18:01.920 --> 18:03.890
which is what I'm trying to do.

18:04.290 --> 18:05.380
Do you know where he is?

18:05.390 --> 18:06.340
I don't know where he went.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.940
But he did go somewhere?

18:09.970 --> 18:11.320
I mean, I guess. I don't know.

18:11.330 --> 18:12.470
So he just abandoned you?

18:12.480 --> 18:13.580
No. Wes wouldn'T.

18:13.590 --> 18:15.260
He was -- he
was scared, okay?

18:15.270 --> 18:17.180
Somebody -- somebody
shot at him, and he was --

18:17.190 --> 18:20.240
he was scared and called the
house and said that he wasn't safe.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.690
That he had to go away
until everything calmed down.

18:22.700 --> 18:26.110
So even if we had waited outside
your apartment for another week,

18:26.120 --> 18:28.160
we would not have
encountered your brother?

18:28.960 --> 18:30.170
No, ma'am.

18:32.410 --> 18:37.060
Did we sley have any friends or people he
hung out with who might know where he went?

18:37.070 --> 18:38.840
Um, I'm not supposed to talk about them.

18:38.850 --> 18:39.860
Why not?

18:39.870 --> 18:40.620
Well, wes
said --

18:40.630 --> 18:44.070
he said that they were fine for him
'cause he knew how to handle them,

18:44.080 --> 18:47.070
but he -- he said
I should stay cleaR.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.320
I'm not supposed to talk about them.

18:48.330 --> 18:53.680
Wesley wouldn't have warned you about
them unless he thought they were dangerous.

18:53.690 --> 18:58.360
There are two separate families who are planning
funerals right now because of what they did.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.250
We need to find them before
they hurt anyone else,

19:01.260 --> 19:02.940
before they hurt you.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.300
These men shot at your brother,
and they almost killed him.

19:07.310 --> 19:11.950
Please, grady, please,
tell me their names.

19:16.380 --> 19:19.860
Thumps --
thumps and R.J.

19:19.870 --> 19:21.300
That sounds like nicknames.

19:21.310 --> 19:22.230
That's what wes called them.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.130
Do you know their last names?

19:25.210 --> 19:27.100
Do you know where they live?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.810
- Did you ever see them?
- Maybe.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.980
Uh, this one time...

19:32.440 --> 19:35.070
my brother was talking
to two people out front.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.110
There was an argument, and the one, R.J.

19:38.950 --> 19:41.210
Wesley took his job, and
he was pretty mad about it.

19:41.220 --> 19:44.450
So do you think that thumps and R.J.
Are the reason that wesley left town?

19:44.460 --> 19:45.510
Was he afraid of them?

19:45.520 --> 19:46.620
I-I don't know. I guess.

19:46.630 --> 19:47.860
Why didn't you go with him?

19:47.870 --> 19:51.770
Why did wesley leave you alone in the
apartment if wesley didn't think it was safe?

19:51.780 --> 19:52.640
I wanted to go with him.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.650
I couldn't afford a ticket back.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.510
Ticket back where, grady?

19:58.060 --> 20:00.990
Did wesley go home to atlanta?

20:05.550 --> 20:06.880
It's okay.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.960
You didn't tell me.

20:09.350 --> 20:10.880
I guessed.

20:11.730 --> 20:13.010
It's okay.

20:16.690 --> 20:17.850
It's okay.

20:25.810 --> 20:26.870
Ticktock, brenda.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.720
I mean, the offer's
only good for 24 hours.

20:28.730 --> 20:30.110
Gary, shush!

20:32.340 --> 20:36.310
Look, fritzi, aren't you just a little bit worried
about selling our home before we find a new one?

20:38.570 --> 20:41.840
Brenda, I haven't really
had a home for over a year,

20:41.850 --> 20:43.810
so, no, I am not worried.

20:43.820 --> 20:47.060
Not to mention the fact that we can't afford a
new house till we get the money from this one.

20:47.070 --> 20:49.090
- I know a mortgage
broker -- - gary, shh!

20:53.070 --> 20:55.390
- You really want to do this?
- I really do.

20:56.140 --> 20:58.310
Okay. I'll make you a deal.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.330
I promise to sign that offer right now

21:00.340 --> 21:04.160
if you promise that you'll
go with me to atlanta.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.250
Well, sure.

21:07.030 --> 21:08.890
- When?
- Tonight.

21:10.140 --> 21:11.690
You promised.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.400
Hello, vicky! Did you miss me?

21:33.410 --> 21:35.610
Come here, girl. Yeah, that's it.

21:42.290 --> 21:43.890
Uh, did you say "vicky"?

21:44.500 --> 21:45.060
Vicky?

21:45.070 --> 21:46.140
Vicky --
that's her name.

21:46.150 --> 21:48.160
Welcome to our home.

21:48.660 --> 21:50.770
It's even lovelier
than brenda described.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.980
Well, I'm surprised she
remembers what it looks like.

21:53.990 --> 21:56.610
Been so long since she paid us a visit.

21:56.620 --> 21:59.290
Well, it can be tough for
brenda to pull away from work.

21:59.790 --> 22:02.030
Look, I know he belongs
with children's services,

22:02.040 --> 22:05.120
but the moment we let little
grady out of our sight,

22:05.130 --> 22:07.990
the first thing he's going to
do is tell his brother, wesley,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.190
that we're looking for him.

22:09.200 --> 22:13.500
I hope we didn't cancel our plans
to spend our holiday in florida

22:13.510 --> 22:18.430
just so we can listen to our daughter
talk on her cellphone the whole week.

22:18.440 --> 22:24.530
We're just happy to have our daughter and
our future son-in-law here for a holiday.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.800
- I can't wait to show you off.
- Okey

22:26.810 --> 22:28.520
Well, thank you, willie ray.

22:31.830 --> 22:33.410
Uh, hang on for just
one second, sergeant.

22:33.740 --> 22:35.440
Um, fritzi, why don't you
take our bags upstairs?

22:35.450 --> 22:38.360
And then mama can give you
the touR. I'm just, uh...

22:39.790 --> 22:41.190
"fritzi"?

22:45.850 --> 22:47.130
"Vicky"?

22:50.550 --> 22:53.850
Just do whatever you can to
keep in control of that boy.

22:53.860 --> 22:56.200
Right. Uh, speaking of control,

22:56.210 --> 23:01.490
there seems to be some question as to who
exactly is in charge, with you being out of town.

23:09.430 --> 23:12.250
Tell commander taylor and that
sawed-off runt detective ross

23:12.260 --> 23:14.830
to just take a pill and stop
blaming us for what happened!

23:14.840 --> 23:17.060
We're only doing what
chief pope told us to do.

23:17.390 --> 23:19.180
And as long as I have a
cellphone, I'm in charge.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.930
Chief! Chief!

23:20.940 --> 23:25.030
I should mention that you're on
speakerphone, and, uh, you know,

23:25.040 --> 23:30.630
commander taylor and detective r--
uh, ross, are honoring us with a visit.

23:32.220 --> 23:33.760
Happy holidays, gentlemen.

23:34.150 --> 23:36.760
Give my best to your family, chief.

23:36.770 --> 23:37.390
Thank you.

23:37.400 --> 23:42.060
And if you really want to hold onto
this kid grady, we can keep him busy.

23:42.070 --> 23:44.160
We can put him in a
room with some mug shots.

23:44.170 --> 23:47.360
Maybe he can I.D. This thumps and R.J.

23:47.370 --> 23:49.580
That is an excellent idea, commander,

23:49.590 --> 23:52.750
but how long do you really think that's gonna
keep children's services out of our hair?

23:52.760 --> 23:57.010
Long enough for us to come up
with another plan to stall them.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.790
Uh, good. Thank you.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.370
And, uh, sergeant gabriel,

24:00.380 --> 24:03.040
I'm gonna need wesley reed's
grandmother's address, please.

24:03.050 --> 24:04.750
Actually, chief, he's not there.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.250
He's not?

24:06.260 --> 24:07.290
How do you know?

24:07.300 --> 24:09.560
Um, because he's in jail.

24:09.570 --> 24:14.790
Apparently he had an outstanding bench warrant back home
for a failure to appear on a drunk-and-disorderly charge,

24:14.800 --> 24:18.280
and his grandmother turned him in
to the police the moment he got home.

24:21.340 --> 24:26.050
Well, I don't think I've
seen a home quite so...

24:28.460 --> 24:31.350
- festive, mrs. Johnson.
- Thank you, fritz.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.680
I always try to make a little
extra effort for the holidays.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.700
Fritzi, we need to go shopping.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.340
- Right now?
- Yes.

24:39.350 --> 24:42.290
Well, if we're going to
the mall, I have to change.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.070
What's the matter with what you have on?

24:44.080 --> 24:45.680
Well, this was for going to the airport.

24:45.690 --> 24:48.110
Oh, no, mama, you're not coming with us.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.730
We're going shopping for you.

24:49.740 --> 24:52.400
They don't have stores in los angeles?

24:52.410 --> 24:55.510
Why are you wasting our
time together at the mall?

24:55.520 --> 25:00.070
Daddy, it was all so last-minute,
we thought we'd do our shopping here.

25:02.290 --> 25:03.730
Come on, fritzi.

25:12.680 --> 25:16.190
Oh, um, daddy, can I borrow your car?

25:27.720 --> 25:29.270
Hold on. Hold on.

25:30.910 --> 25:32.120
You don't even have a warrant?

25:32.130 --> 25:33.050
Not in hand.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.440
Lieutenant tao is working
that out for me right now.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.280
Shouldn't you wait until you have it?

25:37.290 --> 25:40.790
Technically, these guys don't have to
give you access to wesley reed without one.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.190
I know that, but I'm from here,

25:43.200 --> 25:46.340
and I know the local sheriffs departments
aren't as hung up on technicalities

25:46.350 --> 25:49.200
as the federal bureaucrats
you're used to dealing with.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.840
They tend to respond to common
sense and common courtesy.

25:52.630 --> 25:55.200
And if I were you, I'd keep quiet.

25:55.210 --> 25:58.080
They hear that yankee accent,
they might just throw us out.

26:00.910 --> 26:01.870
Hello.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.500
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson
of the los angeles police department.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.930
Well, thank god.

26:09.940 --> 26:13.140
Fellas, everything's gonna be okay.

26:13.150 --> 26:14.840
The lapd is here.

26:15.850 --> 26:17.600
I'm sheriff barney fife.

26:18.780 --> 26:20.030
That's cute.

26:20.900 --> 26:24.640
Anyway, um, sheriff,
uh, pritchard, is it?

26:24.650 --> 26:28.060
I'm so sorry to bother you,
especially during the holiday season.

26:28.070 --> 26:30.210
Oh, I almost forgot.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.490
Merry christmas.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.970
It's my mama's peanut brittle.

26:37.200 --> 26:41.360
So, you have a gentleman in your
lockup by the name of wesley reed.

26:41.370 --> 26:42.710
Are you asking or telling?

26:42.720 --> 26:44.500
Telling, I guess.

26:44.510 --> 26:46.060
I'd really like to talk to him.

26:46.070 --> 26:48.710
He's a person of interest
in a double homicide...

26:48.720 --> 26:50.010
and armed robbery.

26:50.020 --> 26:53.840
So, can I talk to him, please?

26:54.560 --> 26:57.700
Sure. Just you show me a
badge, an I.D., And a warrant.

26:58.050 --> 27:01.560
Oh, is that really necessary?

27:02.770 --> 27:05.640
Tell the little lady to
come back with a warrant.

27:07.870 --> 27:08.740
Okay.

27:08.750 --> 27:11.300
May I please speak to
the person in charge?

27:14.330 --> 27:16.800
Actually, sweetheart...

27:18.000 --> 27:19.480
you already are.

27:19.750 --> 27:20.590
Pardon me.

27:20.600 --> 27:24.320
Sheriff, I'm special agent howard, fbi.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.550
Fbi?

27:27.080 --> 27:31.140
I was just up at that training
seminar you guys put on up at quantico.

27:31.630 --> 27:33.280
Well, why didn't you say you were fbi?

27:33.290 --> 27:36.990
We usually like to maintain a low
profile in these investigations.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.780
Would you object if i spoke with wesley?

27:39.790 --> 27:41.620
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

27:41.930 --> 27:43.800
Why don't you check on your warrant?

27:43.810 --> 27:46.940
"Just step aside, little lady,
and let the men handle this"?

27:46.950 --> 27:48.750
Do you want someone
to talk to wesley reed,

27:48.760 --> 27:51.630
or do you want to strike a
blow for women everywhere?

27:52.450 --> 27:53.980
Go ahead.

27:56.050 --> 27:57.670
- Take a right.
- Thank you.

28:14.190 --> 28:16.280
So, you're wesley reed.

28:16.550 --> 28:20.360
You know you are single-handedly
responsible for ruining my christmas?

28:20.370 --> 28:22.560
I was all set to spend
the holidays quietly --

28:22.570 --> 28:25.500
just my fiancée and me in los angeles,

28:25.510 --> 28:29.310
but now I find myself here,
in a jail cell with you.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.740
I am not on my couch, wesley.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.210
Dude, who are you?

28:34.220 --> 28:36.710
I'm with the fbi. Agent howard.

28:37.110 --> 28:38.350
Fbi?

28:39.470 --> 28:41.510
Well, what are you doing here?

28:41.930 --> 28:44.170
"Member fdic."

28:44.180 --> 28:45.710
That sound familiar?

28:45.720 --> 28:47.410
You ever wonder what that means?

28:47.420 --> 28:48.310
No.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.040
"Federal deposit insurance corporation."

28:51.050 --> 28:53.830
And that means, if somebody
steals money from a bank,

28:53.840 --> 28:55.790
they're stealing it
from the U.S.Government.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.620
Then it automatically
becomes my business.

28:57.630 --> 29:02.100
So, let's talk about the armored-car
robbery you were involved with.

29:03.330 --> 29:04.170
I wasn't involved.

29:04.180 --> 29:05.790
You drove the truck.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.990
Yeah, I drove the truck, but
I wasn't involved, involved.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.760
So why are you here, wesley?

29:11.480 --> 29:14.260
I came home to spend christmas
with my -- with my grandma.

29:14.270 --> 29:15.350
You were so anxious to see her,

29:15.360 --> 29:17.920
you walked out of a hospital
in the middle of medical tests.

29:17.930 --> 29:18.890
I was freaked out, man.

29:18.900 --> 29:20.640
I've never been shot at before.

29:20.650 --> 29:22.940
I just -- I wanted
to get out of town.

29:22.950 --> 29:24.550
How'd you get here so fast?

29:24.560 --> 29:25.680
Plane.

29:25.690 --> 29:28.720
There's no record of you
on any airlines out of L.A.

29:28.730 --> 29:30.100
Drove to vegas, flew from there.

29:30.110 --> 29:33.740
That sounds like the actions of
a man running away from something.

29:33.750 --> 29:35.340
Sorry, agent howard,
but the interview's oveR.

29:35.350 --> 29:37.270
I'm gonna need a few more minutes.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.220
Talk as long as you want
to, sir, just not in here.

29:39.230 --> 29:41.380
Wesley, someone bailed you out.

29:55.230 --> 29:56.870
Hi, there, wesley.

29:56.880 --> 29:57.890
Remember me?

29:57.900 --> 29:58.660
What are you doing here?

29:58.670 --> 30:00.260
I'm posting your bail.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.900
Hope you enjoyed your freedom,
'cause you are under arrest.

30:06.390 --> 30:07.550
Let's go.

30:10.830 --> 30:12.550
$8,000 for bail?

30:12.560 --> 30:14.530
I only had to put down 10%.

30:14.540 --> 30:15.690
I know how bail works, brenda,

30:15.700 --> 30:18.650
but if wesley doesn't make it back
for his hearing, you'll lose the rest.

30:19.230 --> 30:20.460
And he has a history of running away.

30:20.470 --> 30:21.860
Where are you taking me?

30:21.870 --> 30:24.720
Somewhere where I can
ask you a few questions.

30:24.730 --> 30:26.770
I'm not talking to you.

30:26.780 --> 30:28.380
I didn't do anything.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.020
This is total bullshit.

30:30.030 --> 30:31.540
Watch your language, young man.

30:31.550 --> 30:32.880
And if you didn't do anything,

30:32.890 --> 30:35.740
why did you hightail it back across
the country after the robbery?

30:35.750 --> 30:37.950
I already told your fbi
boy I don't know anything.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.200
Now I want my phone call.

30:39.210 --> 30:40.550
I-I want to talk to my brotheR.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.330
As soon as you answer my questions.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.600
I'm not answering nothing.

30:43.610 --> 30:45.440
You got me? Nothing, zip.

30:45.450 --> 30:47.020
I want to talk to my brother!

30:47.030 --> 30:48.540
Not till you answer my questions.

30:48.550 --> 30:50.950
Forget it! I got nothing to say!

30:50.960 --> 30:53.430
Not a word! Nothing!Nada!

30:53.440 --> 30:56.340
For someone who has nothing
to say, you sure do talk a lot.

30:56.350 --> 30:57.560
Why don't you just settle down?

30:57.570 --> 30:59.230
Why don't you just go
back to working at hooters?

30:59.240 --> 31:00.910
Hey, knock it off!

31:03.690 --> 31:04.670
Sit back!

31:07.570 --> 31:08.900
Put your arms up.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.090
What are you doing?

31:12.450 --> 31:14.060
Grab his legs, fritzi.

31:16.070 --> 31:16.950
Hey, wesley.

31:25.270 --> 31:27.450
This is my daddy's caR.

31:27.460 --> 31:28.560
Bitch.

31:32.220 --> 31:35.420
You do one more thing to irritate
me and I'm gonna shoot you!

31:37.720 --> 31:39.390
Brenda doesn't lie.

31:44.580 --> 31:46.890
We were shopping at lenox
square, and all of a sudden,

31:46.900 --> 31:50.770
I see this man, who I recognize
as a fugitive from los angeles.

31:50.780 --> 31:52.240
We've got pictures
all over the precinct.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.200
I wasn't in lenox square.

31:54.950 --> 31:56.960
Mr. Johnson, I will make sure that

31:56.970 --> 32:01.280
brenda gets this man out of your
house first thing in the morning.

32:01.290 --> 32:03.260
Yes, and I will pay for the window.

32:03.270 --> 32:05.800
Daddy, I am so sorry about all of this.

32:05.810 --> 32:10.620
There's no need to apologize,
especially when you don't mean it!

32:13.610 --> 32:15.360
I'm going to bed.

32:17.300 --> 32:20.350
You two are gonnt siup, watch him.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.900
Young man...

32:21.910 --> 32:24.510
try not to murder me in my sleep.

32:34.490 --> 32:37.100
Daddy, I really am sorry,
but I had no choice.

32:37.110 --> 32:38.620
I saw him,
and I --

32:38.630 --> 32:42.890
brenda, don't make things
worse by telling stories.

32:42.900 --> 32:47.660
Now, your mother and i canceled
plans to go to st.Augustine,

32:47.670 --> 32:50.390
where we were gonna meet
up with your brothers,

32:50.400 --> 32:53.780
your sisters-in-law, all
your nieces and nephews.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.430
You understand?

32:55.440 --> 32:58.990
Because you said that you were
gonna be home for christmas.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.060
But i was coming home.

33:01.070 --> 33:03.120
But not to see us.

33:03.570 --> 33:06.650
No, you were coming
home to find that boy,

33:07.770 --> 33:09.950
and then you were gonna take him back.

33:10.140 --> 33:12.240
You are going back, right?

33:15.150 --> 33:17.900
I was hoping this visit,
you'd want to be here,

33:17.910 --> 33:22.530
and not looking to leave as soon
as you unzipped your suitcase.

33:22.850 --> 33:26.450
Oh, daddy, please don't be mad.

33:26.950 --> 33:30.720
He's not mad, brenda
leigh, just disappointed.

33:30.730 --> 33:33.120
Maybe you'll find out
yourself one day --

33:33.130 --> 33:38.090
the child who comes home to visit the
least is the one you want to see the most.

33:39.590 --> 33:42.650
We just miss you is all.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.280
Flynn.

34:10.870 --> 34:13.520
Get on a plane to atlanta now.

34:13.530 --> 34:14.820
What?A
pla--

34:14.830 --> 34:16.770
- I haven't even
fini-- - yes, you have.

34:16.780 --> 34:18.780
I need you on the
next flight to atlanta.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.520
I need you to transport a
witness back to los angeles

34:21.530 --> 34:23.889
'cause I cannot leave my family.

34:23.900 --> 34:24.909
Tonight?

34:24.920 --> 34:27.489
I mean, how about tao or gabriel?

34:27.500 --> 34:30.280
Lieutenant, what part of "get on
a plane" are you struggling with?

34:31.560 --> 34:34.409
Lieutenant tao is getting me my warrant.

34:34.420 --> 34:38.429
Sergeant gabriel is making sure that
little grady doesn't end up in foster care.

34:38.440 --> 34:44.850
You and You and lieutenant provenza have
the most experience with extraditions,

34:45.170 --> 34:48.690
and I purchased the
tickets in your name.

34:48.699 --> 34:51.949
But, chief, I --
I-I hurt my wrist.

34:51.960 --> 34:54.530
Have lieutenant provenza carry the bags.

34:54.540 --> 34:57.000
Get on that plane now.

35:09.810 --> 35:10.930
Business-class tickets?

35:10.940 --> 35:12.500
It's the only seats they had available.

35:12.510 --> 35:13.160
Great

35:13.170 --> 35:14.930
I'll run it through lapd expenses.

35:14.940 --> 35:17.830
Getting money back from a
bureaucracy isn't easy, brenda.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.030
Then I'll pay us back
with our house-sale money.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.230
We don't have that money yet.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.200
Will you stop spending it like we do?

35:23.210 --> 35:25.010
Listen, you and i will
fly home with wesley.

35:25.020 --> 35:26.180
You call flynn back.

35:26.190 --> 35:28.980
No, if we leave now, my
parents are gonna think that

35:28.990 --> 35:31.490
the only reason I came here
was to arrest a fugitive.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.590
That is the only reason.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.680
It's not the only reason!

35:35.240 --> 35:38.740
Look, flynn and provenza
are on their way.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.350
We're gonna stay here
for the holiday --

35:40.360 --> 35:43.910
you and me and mama and daddy
-- and it's going to be nice!

35:43.920 --> 35:45.690
Will you two please shut up?

35:45.700 --> 35:47.340
I'm trying to sleep.

35:47.350 --> 35:49.900
Oh, good. You're awake.

35:49.910 --> 35:52.030
That'll give us some time to chat.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.030
You really gonna marry this woman?

35:55.040 --> 35:56.630
It must be for the money.

35:56.640 --> 35:59.840
I guess I could put up with all her crap
if I could live in a nice house like this.

36:00.270 --> 36:02.240
It's time for you to
answer my questions.

36:03.180 --> 36:04.360
You gonna let me talk to my brother?

36:04.370 --> 36:06.580
I'm sorry. That's not
possible right now.

36:15.170 --> 36:17.480
Oh, this is gonna be a long night.

36:17.490 --> 36:19.430
You get the first shift!

36:21.470 --> 36:24.440
Fine. Move your feet.

36:40.970 --> 36:42.670
He's in my chair!

36:45.860 --> 36:47.370
Better late than neveR.

36:47.380 --> 36:48.850
Come on.Get up.

36:51.860 --> 36:56.290
Lieutenant provenza, lieutenant
flynn, welcome to atlanta.

36:56.300 --> 36:56.910
Thank you.

36:56.920 --> 36:59.980
I could tell it was your house
from a block away, willie ray.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.030
And look
at this --

37:03.210 --> 37:06.740
looks like something out of a
bing crosby christmas special.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.610
Well, thank you, lieutenant.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.370
Let me fix you boys something to eat.

37:10.380 --> 37:12.520
No, mama, they're not hungry,
and they're not staying.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.230
They've got a taxi waiting outside.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.480
No, no, no.

37:15.490 --> 37:16.380
Where have you two been?

37:16.390 --> 37:18.630
You were supposed to
be here two hours ago.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.800
We got bumped. Well, I
mean, we sort of volunteered.

37:20.810 --> 37:22.230
How could we not?

37:22.240 --> 37:25.250
They were offering free tickets to
anyone who would take a later flight.

37:25.260 --> 37:28.880
- Free tickets with no blackout dates!
- And he hasn't shut up about it since.

37:28.890 --> 37:29.840
Is this our package?

37:29.850 --> 37:30.730
Yes, it is.

37:30.740 --> 37:32.170
Gentlemen, meet wesley reed.

37:32.180 --> 37:35.410
He's got a foul mouth, a bad
temper, and he likes to kick things.

37:36.830 --> 37:39.070
- You all have a nice flight.
- Bye!

37:51.190 --> 37:52.950
Keep your hands in your pockets.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.000
I'll cuff you when we're on the plane.

37:55.010 --> 37:56.880
I can't do this. I can't fly.

37:56.890 --> 37:59.060
I-I'm gonna freak out.

37:59.070 --> 38:02.640
Yeah. Well, you didn't freak out
when you flew here from vegas.

38:03.230 --> 38:05.560
I'm getting dizzy. I
can't get on that airplane.

38:05.570 --> 38:06.790
Don't worry about it.

38:06.800 --> 38:09.580
If you start to feel sick,
just throw up all over flynn.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.200
I'm not getting on that airplane.

38:12.210 --> 38:13.540
Yeah, you are!

38:13.550 --> 38:15.260
Thank you. Thank you so much.

38:17.910 --> 38:19.090
I have a bomb.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.640
Yeah, I got a bomb.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.150
I have a bomb!

38:23.160 --> 38:24.800
Just stay calm! Don't panic!

38:24.810 --> 38:28.360
This gentleman is in
custody, and he has no bomb!

38:46.750 --> 38:48.460
I'm sergeant gabriel. Are you...

38:48.470 --> 38:50.250
- I'm with children's services.
- Right.

38:50.260 --> 38:51.840
I'm here to pick up grady reed.

38:51.850 --> 38:53.850
Grady. Great, okay.

38:54.170 --> 38:55.900
Uh, well, as soon as
we are done with him,

38:55.910 --> 38:58.120
I will personally drive
him down to the foster home.

38:58.130 --> 38:59.750
Do you have an address?

38:59.760 --> 39:01.500
Sergeant, that's not how it works.

39:01.510 --> 39:03.010
He needs to come with us now.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.790
She's right. The kid's got to go.

39:06.320 --> 39:09.260
But you did find a foster home
with some protection, right?

39:09.950 --> 39:10.630
Excuse me?

39:10.640 --> 39:15.140
They have automatic weapons on hand and
someone who's comfortable using them?

39:15.150 --> 39:19.420
Grady -- well, he's got
people looking for him.

39:19.430 --> 39:22.910
Yeah, these, uh, these guys
after grady -- they're bad news.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.620
They killed two men a
couple days ago with uzis.

39:25.630 --> 39:29.510
And the family needs to make sure that
they keep their weapons away from him.

39:29.520 --> 39:33.780
He's responsible for breaking one of
our lieutenant's arms. Violent kid.

39:33.790 --> 39:34.720
Oh, my god.

39:34.730 --> 39:39.360
So, I mean, do you have a family that can
handle all that without any liability issues?

39:39.370 --> 39:44.560
Or I guess we could just hold him
in protective custody until you do.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.510
We expecting company, willie ray?

40:04.520 --> 40:05.670
No.

40:06.470 --> 40:08.340
Maybe it's carolers!

40:08.350 --> 40:10.480
Come on. Come on.

40:10.490 --> 40:12.140
Brenda.

40:12.150 --> 40:13.910
Brenda.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.400
Come on!

40:18.280 --> 40:19.640
I love carolers.

40:23.630 --> 40:27.640
There are no rental cars available in
the entire atlanta metropolitan region.

40:27.650 --> 40:29.110
There are no vans available.

40:29.120 --> 40:32.070
And even if there were flights
available, we wouldn't be allowed on one

40:32.080 --> 40:35.170
because we've just been added to
the federal terrorist no-fly list.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.310
I'll be a son of A...

40:46.350 --> 40:49.140
Daddy, I swear, this
wasn't supposed to happen.

40:49.150 --> 40:52.870
Doesn't matter if it was or
wasn't supposed to happen.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.600
It did happen.

40:54.610 --> 41:00.280
Now what we got to do is get that criminal
out of my house and out of my city.

41:07.630 --> 41:12.130
We were gonna drive to florida for
christmas, and so it's all ready.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.930
Isn't it beautiful?

41:13.940 --> 41:15.040
Oh, mama.

41:17.580 --> 41:22.770
It's always been our dream to retire
and travel this great country in an R.V.

41:24.720 --> 41:28.160
I can't say that a fugitive
criminal was part of that dream,

41:28.170 --> 41:31.320
but I suppose that now is as
good a time as any to get started.

41:31.330 --> 41:33.490
Oh, we can't take your R.V.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.050
Well, why not?

41:35.060 --> 41:37.360
She's gassed up and ready to go.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.320
Besides that, it's comfortable.

41:39.630 --> 41:42.570
I don't think I can
drive anything this big.

41:42.580 --> 41:44.800
Don't worry. I'll drive.

41:44.810 --> 41:46.140
The hell you will.

41:46.150 --> 41:49.760
Only person allowed
to drive my R.V. Is...

41:50.400 --> 41:52.160
willie ray.

42:02.450 --> 42:04.430
Thank you, fritz.

42:17.380 --> 42:19.140
Are you gonna do anything to help me?

42:19.150 --> 42:20.200
I am helping.

42:20.210 --> 42:23.640
I'm making sure we have the proper paperwork
to take our fugitive across the country.

42:23.650 --> 42:24.810
Lieutenant tao...

42:25.650 --> 42:28.650
I need an update as to whether I
have an arrest warrant for wesley reed

42:28.660 --> 42:31.140
so I don't face charges of
kidnapping when I get home.

42:31.150 --> 42:34.170
And please don't turn off your cellphone
when I'm in a different time zone.

42:34.180 --> 42:35.770
Thank you.

42:36.120 --> 42:37.730
Happy holidays.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.110
Okay. I'm here to help.

42:42.620 --> 42:43.890
Never mind.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.750
Oh, mama, that's nice.

43:04.260 --> 43:06.050
Sit down, please, at the table.

43:16.080 --> 43:17.840
Don't even think about it.

43:18.990 --> 43:23.860
These are for five days of jockey shorts,
socks, deodorant, razors, toothbrushes.

43:23.870 --> 43:24.990
Thank you.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.130
And here's a receipt for these
stylish clothes he picked out.

43:29.140 --> 43:33.620
And you, listen, I'm not
gonna handcuff you, okay?

43:33.630 --> 43:37.760
'Cause this R.V. 'S gonna be traveling
down the highway at about 60 miles an houR.

43:37.770 --> 43:41.560
So if you jump out, you'll be doing
us all a big favoR. You got it?

43:41.570 --> 43:44.160
Happy holidays to you, too, asshole.

43:46.420 --> 43:48.160
Watch your language.

43:50.710 --> 43:51.930
Water bottles.

43:51.940 --> 43:53.400
- In the fridge.
- Check.

43:53.410 --> 43:54.380
Vicky?

43:54.390 --> 43:56.050
At the neighbor'S.

43:56.060 --> 43:59.200
- Perry como christmas cd.
- Check.

44:01.760 --> 44:05.680
Now, the key to long-distance
travel is organization.

44:05.690 --> 44:10.780
I've made a schedule that would
allow us to get to L.A.In four days.

44:10.790 --> 44:12.510
If we adhere strictly to it,

44:12.520 --> 44:17.020
we should be able to skip most of the
rush-hour traffic in the metropolitan areas

44:17.030 --> 44:18.550
that we'll be traveling through.

44:18.560 --> 44:21.700
Now, since this vehicle
only sleeps five,

44:21.710 --> 44:26.290
we'll be stopping at several
high-class R.V.Motels,

44:26.300 --> 44:29.740
where lieutenant provenza
and lieutenant flynn will,

44:29.750 --> 44:33.440
uh, disembark for the
night and get some shut-eye.

44:34.210 --> 44:36.580
Lieutenant provenza, what
is the matter with you?

44:36.590 --> 44:39.040
I-it's all this garland stuff up here.

44:39.050 --> 44:40.790
It makes my eyes wateR.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.330
He's allergic to christmas.

44:42.340 --> 44:43.600
What a surprise.

44:45.290 --> 44:48.880
All right, hold it up and move it out!

45:24.460 --> 45:28.980
Clay,I cannot drive safely if
you keep distracting me this way.

45:28.990 --> 45:31.450
Cheese and crackers,willie ray!

45:31.470 --> 45:34.930
You know only one thing gets
me in the holiday spirit.

45:34.960 --> 45:38.260
Well,your perry como cds didn't
just get up and walk away.

45:38.290 --> 45:40.880
They've got to be here somewhere.

45:40.930 --> 45:43.530
Why don't we all sing some carols?

45:43.560 --> 45:45.440
Wouldn't that be fun?

45:45.750 --> 45:53.950
O come,all ye faithful
joyful and triumphant

45:53.960 --> 45:55.950
o come ye,

45:55.960 --> 46:01.840
o come ye to bethlehem

46:01.870 --> 46:03.860
come on,everybody!

46:03.920 --> 46:11.540
Come and behold him
born the king of angels

46:11.560 --> 46:12.580
there's not much traffic today.

46:12.630 --> 46:15.130
We're making awfully good time.

46:19.260 --> 46:21.030
you know what I keep thinking about?

46:21.070 --> 46:23.080
That old guard that died.

46:23.110 --> 46:25.100
What was his name?

46:26.300 --> 46:27.230
Arnie,I think.

46:27.260 --> 46:30.250
Right.Arnie,arnie,arnie.

46:30.270 --> 46:35.620
The one who told wesley to stay inside when
his friends were shooting up that armored caR.

46:36.670 --> 46:38.990
Did y'all ever talk?

46:39.620 --> 46:41.720
Arnie was a nice older guy.

46:41.750 --> 46:44.070
Had a family that loved him.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.150
Was arnie ever rude to you,wesley?

46:48.170 --> 46:49.380
I want to speak to my brotheR.

46:49.430 --> 46:51.240
You're so concerned about
your brother's welfare,

46:51.270 --> 46:52.660
why did you run away,

46:52.700 --> 46:56.940
leave him alone in a city he barely
knew thousands of miles from home?

46:57.280 --> 46:59.530
You must have felt you
were in danger of some kind.

46:59.560 --> 47:01.490
Please.
I'm --

47:02.330 --> 47:04.170
I'm begging you,okay?

47:04.210 --> 47:07.820
Just -- just five minutes
with him on the phone.

47:07.860 --> 47:09.820
He's gonna be freaked
out not hearing from me.

47:09.850 --> 47:13.480
You want to find out what's going
on with grady,you talk to me first.

47:13.890 --> 47:15.180
Wait.

47:17.710 --> 47:19.880
I need to use the toilet.

47:20.830 --> 47:22.520
Lieutenant.

47:26.390 --> 47:27.760
come on.

47:31.170 --> 47:32.810
Far as I go.

47:40.380 --> 47:41.320
Hello?

47:41.350 --> 47:42.420
Hello,chief.

47:42.440 --> 47:44.640
Am I on speakerphone?

47:44.690 --> 47:46.510
No.

47:47.210 --> 47:48.660
Oh,good.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.500
Lieutenant tao,do we have our warrant?

47:50.550 --> 47:52.250
Uh,no,but here's the good news.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.120
When wesley reed was
charged with possession,

47:54.150 --> 47:57.850
he agreed to attend a diversion program as
part of his sentencing,but he didn't finish it.

47:57.890 --> 48:00.570
As soon as you get him back to
california,you can arrest him.

48:00.620 --> 48:05.170
I still don't have the paperwork I
need to bring him across state lines.

48:06.110 --> 48:09.420
Look,no matter what,don't put
me on the phone with chief pope.

48:09.470 --> 48:12.180
If y'all need to call me,just
call me from your cellphones.

48:12.210 --> 48:13.740
Any news on the shooters?

48:13.780 --> 48:15.000
The shooters.

48:15.840 --> 48:18.060
Yeah,chief
-- uh,sorry.

48:18.120 --> 48:22.840
As far as known associates,nothing's come
up yet on either nickname grady gave us.

48:22.880 --> 48:25.140
Tell her about the getaway caR.

48:25.170 --> 48:26.660
This crew's three
previous robberies --

48:26.690 --> 48:29.610
twice they used an astro
van,and once a chevy suburban.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.710
These are not rare vehicles,detective.

48:31.750 --> 48:33.500
Well,that's probably
why they use them,chief.

48:33.540 --> 48:36.400
Ask her about pope. About pope.***

48:36.430 --> 48:39.810
Hold on. Sergeant gabriel
wants to talk to you.

48:41.760 --> 48:44.430
So,uh,what do you want me to tell pope?

48:44.510 --> 48:46.560
Well,tell him I'm having
extradition problems

48:46.590 --> 48:48.900
and I'll call him when I have some news.

48:48.930 --> 48:50.060
What does grady say?

48:50.080 --> 48:52.990
Well,chief,if he knows anything about
our shooters other than their nickname,

48:53.020 --> 48:54.700
he's not telling.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.030
Well,where is he now?

48:56.070 --> 48:56.980
In your office.

48:57.030 --> 49:00.830
Put him in my house,please,before
somebody notices he's not in foster care.

49:00.860 --> 49:03.200
And try and get him to talk to you.

49:03.230 --> 49:04.380
Chief,chief.

49:04.420 --> 49:06.570
Let sanchez have a go at him.

49:09.680 --> 49:12.060
Take detective sanchez with you.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.920
- Chief.
- Yes?

49:13.960 --> 49:16.130
I got water here. I got water here!

49:16.160 --> 49:18.040
****Let me call you right back.

49:18.080 --> 49:18.980
Wesley!

49:19.540 --> 49:21.010
Wesley,what are you doing in there?

49:21.050 --> 49:23.090
Open the door this instant!

49:23.130 --> 49:23.850
He's breaking the window.

49:23.920 --> 49:26.690
Clay,I'm pulling off the highway.

49:26.700 --> 49:29.210
Pull off the first street
and park as quick as you can.

49:29.260 --> 49:30.590
Okay.

49:33.020 --> 49:37.100
Son! If you hurt my R.V.,I
may just have to kill you!

49:37.140 --> 49:38.650
Daddy! Daddy,please.

49:38.680 --> 49:39.610
Brenda leigh,no.

49:39.660 --> 49:42.070
I just replaced that
dooR. You can't kick it in.

49:42.110 --> 49:43.210
I-I'll unlock it.

49:43.240 --> 49:44.940
Let me go get the key.

49:45.180 --> 49:46.560
Why don't we just shoot the bastard?

49:46.590 --> 49:49.220
Wesley reed,open this door this instant!

49:49.250 --> 49:51.930
He's going out the window,chief.
He's going out that window.

50:05.350 --> 50:07.400
Get off me! Get off me!

50:07.760 --> 50:09.240
Wesley!

50:21.770 --> 50:23.670
So,clay,what's the good news?

50:23.720 --> 50:28.020
Well,your little friend there not
only snapped off the foot paddle,

50:28.050 --> 50:30.320
- he also stuffed his
shirt -- - my shirt.

50:30.340 --> 50:37.020
Whoever's shirt -- so far down the toilet
that I have to have my dump valves snaked.

50:37.240 --> 50:41.120
I'm calling a plumber and have him meet
us at the first R.V.Motel we come to.

50:41.140 --> 50:42.070
I'm so sorry.

50:42.110 --> 50:43.840
I'll pay for everything,I promise.

50:43.870 --> 50:45.150
You bet you will.

50:45.190 --> 50:48.580
In the meantime,that head is off limits.

50:48.620 --> 50:49.910
Damn it!

50:49.970 --> 50:50.900
Come on,everybody. Get on.

50:50.940 --> 50:55.870
Wait -- clay,are you telling me we're gonna
go cross-country with no working toilet?

50:55.900 --> 50:59.620
The pioneers who settled this
country didn't have working toilets,

50:59.670 --> 51:03.580
and they didn't have hundreds of
clean rest stops all along the highway.

51:03.630 --> 51:05.190
We'll manage,lieutenant.

51:05.230 --> 51:06.190
Yes,ma'am.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.130
Come on.

51:08.750 --> 51:10.700
Will you knock it off?

51:10.960 --> 51:12.140
What do you think you're doing?

51:12.180 --> 51:13.970
Fritz,would you like to
give me a hand,please?

51:14.030 --> 51:15.450
I'm not getting back on that thing.

51:15.490 --> 51:16.340
Oh,yeah?

51:17.420 --> 51:18.510
Hey,help! Help!

51:18.540 --> 51:20.980
These people are trying to kidnap me!

51:21.000 --> 51:21.920
Shut up!

51:21.940 --> 51:24.520
Call the police! Help!

51:24.550 --> 51:26.940
Fbi,ladies and gentlemen. Fbi.

51:26.970 --> 51:28.420
Sorry for the interruption.

51:28.460 --> 51:30.140
Listen to me,you
delinquent --

51:30.180 --> 51:33.660
I want you to calm down,get out from
under this table,and get on that R.V.Now!

51:33.690 --> 51:35.140
Not until I talk to my brotheR.

51:35.170 --> 51:36.970
I'm afraid that's not possible,wesley.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.830
Why not? Why can't I speak to him?

51:38.870 --> 51:40.660
I didn't want to have to tell you this,

51:40.690 --> 51:42.590
but on the day that
you left los angeles,

51:42.620 --> 51:47.640
unidentified assailants broke into the apartment
that you share with grady and attacked him.

51:49.180 --> 51:49.890
What are you talking about?

51:49.940 --> 51:53.690
By the time responding officers
arrived on the scene,grady,

51:53.720 --> 51:57.600
who had been shot several times at
close range with an automatic weapon,

51:57.620 --> 51:59.860
could not be resuscitated.

52:07.890 --> 52:08.640
You're lying.

52:08.690 --> 52:10.030
I wish I were.

52:13.160 --> 52:15.460
Where is he? Where is he right now?

52:17.360 --> 52:21.020
He's at the L.A.Morgue,pending
notification of next of kin for funeral --

52:21.050 --> 52:22.660
I'm his next of kin!

52:22.700 --> 52:24.170
I am!

52:24.310 --> 52:25.640
I'm his...

52:25.690 --> 52:26.810
next of kin.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.650
I'm sorry about this,wesley.

52:29.160 --> 52:30.840
I really am.

52:32.890 --> 52:35.230
No! No!

52:46.530 --> 52:48.200
Wesley...

52:49.100 --> 52:51.900
don't think about
anything else for a second.

52:51.930 --> 52:54.370
Just give me your hand.

53:07.490 --> 53:08.910
Come on.

53:29.230 --> 53:30.250
Chief...

53:30.290 --> 53:33.230
chief,I-I don't know if
that was such a good idea.

53:33.570 --> 53:36.720
If it gets him to talk,it's
an excellent idea,lieutenant.

53:36.730 --> 53:39.710
Before you get back on the R.V.I'd
like you to call lieutenant tao.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.990
Have him go back to wesley's apartment

53:41.020 --> 53:43.700
and fake a crime scene
depicting grady's murdeR.

53:43.750 --> 53:45.250
Thank you.

53:50.510 --> 53:52.080
Where the hell is everybody?

53:52.440 --> 53:53.960
good evening,chief pope.

53:53.990 --> 53:57.000
Why are chief johnson and flynn and
provenza not back with our suspect?

53:57.040 --> 54:00.250
Uh,the D.A.Wouldn't allow
payment on an extradition order,

54:00.290 --> 54:02.700
based on wesley's absence
from a diversion program.

54:02.730 --> 54:07.830
So I faxed chief johnson a waiver
which,if the suspect signs it,

54:07.850 --> 54:08.920
it will
allow us to --

54:08.960 --> 54:12.910
she expects wesley reed to remand
himself into L.A.P.D.Custody

54:12.950 --> 54:15.460
while we're investigating
him for felony murder?

54:15.500 --> 54:18.490
And she needs flynn and provenza
to help her accomplish that?

54:18.530 --> 54:21.850
Um,there --you know,there was an
airport problem,and,unfortunately --

54:21.880 --> 54:27.840
Are you telling me they are driving
the suspect here from atlanta?

54:27.870 --> 54:29.210
You know,they're almost here
--making really good time.

54:29.240 --> 54:31.830
They're in willcox,arizona.

54:31.850 --> 54:33.820
Without a warrant?

54:34.030 --> 54:36.070
Get chief johnson
on the phone --now.

54:39.580 --> 54:44.540
Wesley,you haven't eaten
since day before yesterday.

54:45.110 --> 54:46.070
Okay.

54:46.110 --> 54:50.750
I've got lieutenants flynn and
provenza all squared away in the motel,

54:50.780 --> 54:52.360
and here's the receipt.

54:52.410 --> 54:53.450
Oh,great.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.760
If you don't want the fried chicken,

54:55.780 --> 54:58.440
I'll bet we could get
you a hamburger somewhere.

54:58.490 --> 54:59.470
Hello?

54:59.510 --> 55:01.450
I'm sorry,chief. It's her voice mail.

55:01.500 --> 55:02.570
I'll just leave her a message.

55:02.620 --> 55:05.890
Perhaps she already received the
waiver and she's gonna call to confirm.

55:05.930 --> 55:07.170
I've got the waiver in my hand.

55:07.210 --> 55:10.290
I don't know how I'm ever gonna get wesley
to sign it when he won't even talk to me.

55:10.340 --> 55:12.040
I do not know.

55:13.480 --> 55:15.530
Are you standing right next to pope?

55:15.580 --> 55:16.690
Uh,hello,chief.

55:16.740 --> 55:18.010
This is lieutenant tao,

55:18.040 --> 55:20.610
- and chief pope would like me
to tell you -- - give me the phone

55:20.650 --> 55:22.310
Uh,chief pope will tell you himself.

55:22.360 --> 55:23.770
Freeze!

55:28.040 --> 55:30.040
Chief johnson,when I put you
in charge of this investigation,

55:30.070 --> 55:33.600
it was to stop a gang that uses automatic
weapons from striking another armored car

55:33.620 --> 55:36.640
and killing more people here in L.A.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.330
If you're not back here
by tomorrow afternoon,

55:38.340 --> 55:40.080
taylor is taking over the case again.

55:40.110 --> 55:43.260
And you better have a-a warrant
or extradition papers for wesley,

55:43.310 --> 55:45.400
because I don't want him
getting off on murder charges

55:45.440 --> 55:47.930
because you don't have
your paperwork in ordeR.

55:48.170 --> 55:49.310
Unfreeze.

55:54.980 --> 55:59.260
Look,daddy,we're gonna have to get back
to los angeles by late tomorrow afternoon.

55:59.290 --> 56:02.070
That means we're all gonna have
to leave really,really early.

56:02.110 --> 56:03.670
I'm -- I'm
so sorry.

56:03.710 --> 56:06.420
You know,if you don't mind
me sticking my nose in,

56:06.450 --> 56:10.320
I've been thinking about the problem
you and your mother have been having,

56:10.390 --> 56:15.340
and I've come up with a
two-bird,one-stone solution.

56:16.510 --> 56:18.620
Over 21?

56:21.200 --> 56:23.720
Wesley,you know what?

56:23.750 --> 56:27.660
I think you're still in
a little bit of shock,

56:27.690 --> 56:36.400
And what you may need to get your appetite
back is a good,stiff drink...or two.

56:36.790 --> 56:39.760
Do you take it on the
rocks or straight up,son?

56:39.840 --> 56:40.850
You got any coke?

56:40.890 --> 56:41.630
Coke?

56:41.660 --> 56:43.190
Son,that's premium bourbon.

56:43.220 --> 56:45.420
You don't put soda in that.

56:45.450 --> 56:46.950
I drink it with coke.

56:46.990 --> 56:49.130
Daddy,get the coke.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.740
Doesn't seem right,though.

56:53.780 --> 56:56.160
You know,wesley has a
drug and alcohol problem.

56:56.190 --> 56:58.640
And his friends are
killing people with uzis.

56:58.680 --> 57:02.590
Would you rather see wesley hung
over or more dead guards on the news?

57:03.160 --> 57:04.800
Pick your poison.

57:04.850 --> 57:09.430
Well,the kid's going into
lifetime rehab,anyway.

57:15.130 --> 57:16.670
Thanks.

57:26.990 --> 57:32.100
Second drink comes when your
dinner plate is half empty.

57:39.530 --> 57:42.840
So,you told us a few days ago
that your brother's friend R.J.

57:42.870 --> 57:45.740
Was irritated when wesley
got hired by tas,right?

57:45.780 --> 57:49.390
Y-yeah. Uh...he didn't
think it was faiR.

57:49.490 --> 57:55.390
So I went through all the employment applications
to tas from the same time your brother was hired,

57:55.420 --> 57:59.560
and I found a guy named
randall jackson gibson.

57:59.820 --> 58:03.510
Now,tas turned randall down after
speaking with a previous employer --

58:03.540 --> 58:05.260
the owner of a
used-car dealership --

58:05.280 --> 58:07.310
and he said that while
randall was working for him,

58:07.360 --> 58:11.000
everal of his vehicles went
missing,including an astro van.

58:11.030 --> 58:15.270
That's one of the getaway vehicles
the gang who shot at your brother uses.

58:15.300 --> 58:18.740
So you got to look
at these photos. Okay?

58:18.770 --> 58:20.490
If you could
identify R.J.For us --

58:20.520 --> 58:23.280
w-what about thumps?

58:23.300 --> 58:25.120
They roll together
-- R.J.And thumps.

58:25.150 --> 58:27.440
Look,grady,grady.

58:27.460 --> 58:31.860
These guys are going to kill your
brotheR. And if we let you go,guess what.

58:31.880 --> 58:33.210
They're gonna be waiting for you.

58:33.240 --> 58:37.360
So here's the deal -- I got a bunch
of photos here,and one of these is R.J.

58:37.380 --> 58:39.970
So you need to pick him out right now!

58:40.000 --> 58:42.480
Or I am going to drive
you to family services,

58:42.510 --> 58:46.150
where they will place you
in foster care -- and bang!

58:46.180 --> 58:49.080
We'll send flowers to your funeral.

58:50.320 --> 58:53.430
You -- you said -- you
saidI was a material witness.

58:53.470 --> 58:54.800
You said that I had to be protected.

58:54.840 --> 58:58.850
Yeah,well,you're not a witness
if you did not see anything!

58:58.880 --> 59:03.890
So if you cannot identify R.J.,We
got no reason to protect you!

59:07.960 --> 59:10.560
You swear this helps my brother?

59:11.340 --> 59:13.140
On your honor?

59:16.060 --> 59:17.970
On my honoR.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.400
4.

59:23.420 --> 59:24.220
Now,are you sure?

59:24.270 --> 59:25.670
It's 4.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.240
We went to this guy's apartment.

59:30.270 --> 59:32.950
He wasn't there --
no forwarding address.

59:33.170 --> 59:35.080
So I've picked him out,and
you can't even find him?

59:35.120 --> 59:37.530
Trust me --
I'll find him.

59:37.630 --> 59:39.500
On my honoR.

59:45.860 --> 59:47.170
hey

59:49.180 --> 59:51.090
How about a roadie?

59:52.740 --> 59:53.940
Hey.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.310
Brenda?

59:56.130 --> 59:58.110
On one condition.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.770
I need to get some fresh aiR.

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.550
What's his problem?

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.930
Just a little tired,I guess.

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:13.800
So,you want that drink or not?

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.200
Yeah.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.780
I need you to look at a picture first.

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:23.960
A witness identified this
man as one of the two people

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:27.580
fleeing from your apartment on
the night thatgrady was murdered.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:31.180
Randall jackson gibson.

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:39.320
Wesley,I need you to help me find
the guys who murdered your brotheR.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.630
And you can help me.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.680
I know it.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.760
No one was supposed to get hurt.

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:50.450
They -- they
promised.

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:52.300
They were
just --

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.130
just supposed to shoot
across my windshield.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.310
But then I...saw arnie get hit.

01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:02.600
And I saw him fall,and I,uh...

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:11.670
you got out of the caR.
You broke with the plan.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:14.120
I yelled at them to stop it.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.350
And then they fired at me.

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:20.470
I-I didn't know what to do.

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:26.470
I was so...scared that
I left grady behind.

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:30.210
I left him behind 'cause I
was too scared to go home.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:35.020
I ran out on my little
brotheR. I ran out on him.

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:38.450
I ran out on him.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:53.510
So...randall jackson is your friend.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:56.150
And -- and
the other guy?

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.210
Thumps.

01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:05.120
Jimmy grissom.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.890
He and R.J. Are meth heads.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.110
I stopped using
when -- ...

01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:11.550
When I got grady.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.070
I went to atlanta and took him to L.A.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.070
'Cause my stupid grandmother...

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.520
you know how lucky you are? Huh?

01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:27.970
- Do you have any idea?
- Lucky?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.690
You think everyone grows up in a family with
a mom and a dad who can take care of 'em?

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.000
'Cause they don'T.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:40.610
Well,my daddy -- he dropped me and
grady off at gran's when I was 9,

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:42.850
and he never came back.

01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:47.260
And my mother was an addict,who
finally O.D.'D last yeaR.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:51.930
So I took grady from gran because
someone had to look after him.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.300
Why did they have to hurt him? Why?

01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:01.540
Maybe they were mad at
you 'cause you ran away.

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:03.090
Y'all were supposed to be partners.

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:08.260
You even joined tas so you could
find out where the big hauls were.

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.230
Isn't that right?

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:12.620
You know what?

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:16.090
I liked it there.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.790
Arnie -- He
was my friend.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:27.730
He used to have us over
for dinneR. Then,um...

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:32.670
hayes took me and grady to
a professional baseball game.

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.320
Dodgers.

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.790
And they had fireworks.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.790
And grady said it was
the best night of...

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:51.310
where are R.J...and thumps?

01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:53.980
I don't know.

01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:55.640
You were in contact with them.

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.250
Not once I got the job with tas.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:03.600
Well,uh...they used to
send me --what is it?

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:06.750
A disposable phone in
the mail and call me,

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.470
and I gave them route information.

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:11.170
When I was done with
it,I threw the phone away.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.180
We weren't even supposed to
meet up till our next job.

01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:16.810
There's gonna be another robbery?

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.590
Christmas eve.

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:20.260
Where?

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.850
I could find out where.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.650
I know R.J.'S girlfriend
--not her name,but her face.

01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:31.090
And I know where she hangs out.

01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:34.090
All right,wesley.

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:38.450
In order to set up a
deal for you with the D.A.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.870
I'm gonna need you to sign
this extradition waiveR.

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:45.570
And then you can help
us find R.J.And thumps,

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:48.250
and maybe some good will
come out of all this.

01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:49.590
Yeah.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:55.570
Like maybe they get
their heads blown off.

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.760
Thank you,wesley.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:11.980
- You know,when all this is
over-- - it's over already,brenda.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.780
It was over the day before yesterday.

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:26.290
No,thanks.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.890
It's not helping anymore.

01:05:44.550 --> 01:05:45.560
Welcome back,chief.

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:46.750
Hey,chief.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:48.590
Detective,lieutenant.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.890
Are your parents with you?

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.470
Uh,they are just about to park the R.V.

01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:54.400
In front of my house
in about 25 minutes.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.200
What's happening here?

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:58.010
Robbery/homicide division is still
staking out likely target banks

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.590
based on wesley's scheduled route.

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:03.300
And we cued up the crime-scene
video you asked foR.

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.120
Wonderful. Thank you.

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:07.790
Okay,wesley.

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:08.880
Come on.

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.970
There's something you need to see.

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.930
Do you have a deputy D.A.Coming
in and a lawyer for wesley?

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.750
They're in an interview room together,

01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:20.070
and chief pope wants to see you
upstairs as soon as you're done.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:20.840
Okay.

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:22.130
Chief.

01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:23.540
You got the boy's confession.

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:29.380
I-I think he would be even more cooperative
if he knew that his little brother was alive.

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:31.340
That's a gamble,lieutenant.

01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:37.630
Okay,wesley.

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:39.880
You really want to see this?

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.520
Okay,buzz.

01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:51.100
Buzz.

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:52.630
In here.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.720
You have to identify
yourself for the court.

01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.910
Oh,sorry.

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:00.720
Hello.

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:02.670
Lieutenant michael
tao,priority homicide.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.590
We believe the struggle began in here

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:08.320
when the assailants discovered our
victim hiding underneath this bed.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:12.050
We also feel that when the
information was extracted,

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:16.620
someone or somebody took
something out of here.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.840
Go to julio --
uh,detective sanchez.

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:22.230
Detective julio sanchez.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:26.310
We think this blood came from our victim's
scalp when his head struck the wall here.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:31.020
The victim suffered multiple
gunshot wounds here,here,and here.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.110
Contusions,lacerations,and abrasions.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.930
The victim was found
duct-taped to this chaiR.

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:40.870
Get that side.

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:44.380
For now,that's it,buzz.

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:45.750
Thanks.

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:56.740
What do you want me to do?

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.510
Last night,wesley reed signed a waiver

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:02.980
allowing us to transfer him from
georgia to the custody of the L.A.P.D.

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.240
He's been read his rights in
front of a public defender,

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.370
repeated his confession,

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:12.370
and made a deal with the D.A.To turn
state's evidence against our shooters.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.990
In return for leniency,wesley's
agreed to wear a wire and a camera

01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:19.850
and make an attempt to locate
randall jackson gibson,A.K.A.R.J.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.170
And james grissom,A.K.A.Thumps,

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:26.140
before their next robbery,which he
believes will happen sometime tomorrow.

01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:27.930
Great work.

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:32.700
You got a confession,and now we have everything we
need to put these other two guys away once we find them.

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:38.060
I have S.I.S.Units coordinating with
robbery/homicide all along wesley's route.

01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:40.439
Of course,the armored cars
won't have any cash on them,

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:44.450
and they'll be covered by nearly an
entire division of police officers.

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:46.000
In order to enlist his cooperation,

01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:49.490
I told wesley that R.J. And
thumps murdered his little brotheR.

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:50.660
So I feel
responsible for --

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:54.540
sending wesley back out on the street is
a condition of his agreement with the D.A.

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:56.890
So...it's not your problem.

01:08:56.939 --> 01:09:00.710
Set up the wire on wesley,turn him over
to commander taylor and detective ross,

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.470
and enjoy what's left of your
holiday while they mop up.

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:09.040
And so,afterward,you'll let wesley and
grady meet for an hour on christmas day?

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.200
Look,wesley made a deal.

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:12.819
But if he hadn't
turned state's evidence,

01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:15.930
he'd be looking at the death
penalty,which I think he deserves.

01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:20.050
Please don't tell me you're feeling some
sort of misplaced holiday compassion here,

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.189
because,to me,this kid's a killeR.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.590
And I treated him like one.

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:26.109
But for the sake of his
little brother,I think --

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:30.529
I,uh,see no problem with
a christmas visit,chief.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:35.130
Well,if you want to bring a teenage boy
to county jail on christmas day,okay.

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.620
Thank you,commandeR.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:39.300
W-wait a minute,chief.

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.290
Uh,we spent days with wesley.

01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:43.600
I mean,we've established
a relationship with him.

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:45.500
I don't think it's a good
idea to hand him off to a --

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:47.310
excuse me,lieutenant.
Chief pope is right.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.040
This is a tactical operation
now,for which S.I.S.

01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:53.779
And robbery/homicide are
much more suited than we are.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.720
Excuse us,gentlemen.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:04.380
Well,that was...a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:05.680
Yeah.

01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:07.480
I wonder why.

01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:27.760
okay.

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:31.050
That wire's not a homing device.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:34.760
You don't let detective ross
know where you are,he'll lose you.

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:36.380
If you think you're
about to get in trouble,

01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:39.150
just tell me where you
are -- I'll come running.

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:41.290
Otherwise,I'm gonna try to
stay about half a mile away.

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.780
We don't want to make
your friends nervous.

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:44.640
The video camera's in this button.

01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:46.310
It doesn't broadcast live.

01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:48.080
We download it when
you give it back to us.

01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:52.560
Which means I got no picture of
what's going on,so keep talking.

01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:54.210
Let me do a sound check.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.310
Where's brenda?

01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:08.250
She's not participating in
this phase of the investigation.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.350
But isn't she even gonna
come in and say goodbye?

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.820
Look,it doesn't matteR. You're only
gonna be out on the street until tomorrow.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.200
Then you're gonna return
here and turn yourself in.

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:18.760
You can see her then.

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:21.290
Okay.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.720
Well,tell her I said "so long."

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:25.590
All right.

01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:27.610
Let me get our end of
things. I'll be right back.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:38.970
Anything else?

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:40.740
Uh,no. Thank you.

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:44.820
Uh,just,uh...just try to
make sure he doesn't get hurt.

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:46.570
- Do my best.
- Thank you.

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:58.270
Just in case we miss each other...

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:00.930
merry christmas,lieutenant.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.950
For real.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.780
Yeah?

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:09.160
Okay.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.940
Merry christmas.

01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:12.600
And remember
this,wesley --

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.940
you run off,this whole deal goes away,

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:20.780
and then you're gonna be facing two charges
of felony murder in the first degree.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.890
You got it?

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.780
All right. Let's go.

01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:43.230
We have the transmitters
embedded in his shoes?

01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:44.720
Yes,but I don't want
to oversell it,chief.

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:48.430
We have longitude and latitude and about
a 100-yard radius in which to track him,

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:51.070
but precise,it is not.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.200
Well,it's in taylor's hands now.

01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:59.150
And if the commander drops the ball,we've
got another chance to pick it up.

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.350
Hi,sergeant.

01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:20.120
welcome back,chief.

01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:22.590
Where is everybody?

01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:26.800
Fritz went to bed,your
father's asleep in the R.V.

01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:30.250
And sergeant gabriel had
to watch over grady here.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:34.830
Who your father and i were
very surprised to meet.

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:39.870
Anyway,I stayed up with the sergeant
to keep him company until you came home.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.270
Uh,I'm gonna...Step out on
the porch for a minute,okay?

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.090
If you need me,just call.

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.630
Thanks.

01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:02.600
I know what you're thinking,mama.

01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:07.550
But I had to lie about grady being dead
so that wesley would tell me the truth.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.610
That's my job.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.700
And you had to lie to
your father and me,too.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.620
We drove all the way across the country

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:20.210
feeling just horrible about
the murder of a young boy

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:22.950
who is fast asleep on your sofa.

01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:46.040
If I had told you and daddy the truth,you
would have treated wesley differently,

01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:48.570
and then he might have figured
out that I was lying to him,

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.750
and then he wouldn't have confessed.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.720
And I'm sorry if your feelings got hurt,

01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:55.550
but what I did will help bring
two murderers in off the streets,

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.930
and that has to be worth something.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:02.040
Worth -- worth putting wesley
through four days of hell,

01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:05.620
making him feel responsible
for the death of the one person

01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:09.030
he loved more than
anyone else in the world?

01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:14.380
You feel so sorry for wesley.

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:19.590
What about these two men?

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.430
Arnie gillon and jimmy hayes.

01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:25.850
Two families are gonna have an empty seat
at the table for christmas dinner this year

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.010
because of what wesley did.

01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:32.790
Talk to the gillons or jimmy's mom.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.220
See how they feel about
how awful I was to wesley.

01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:39.510
Excuse me,chief.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:42.880
speaking of wesley,he
apparently just dumped his wire.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.470
Ross lost him.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.730
I want two squad cars outside of this
house right now and someone from S.I.S.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.390
And as soon as they get here,I want you
to come back to the murder room,okay?

01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:55.680
Thank you.

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:57.200
Mama...

01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:02.020
I feel terrible about
how I had to treat wesley.

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:06.670
But just know -- if I had
to do it all over again...

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.370
I wouldn't change a thing.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.760
Hey,brenda.

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:42.340
Uh,I watched that crime-scene tape
you showed me,and you know what?

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.360
It showed how R.J. And thumps broke in

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:48.310
and how they killed grady
looking for the money.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.940
Here's the
thing --

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:52.120
R.J.And thumps knew where
my money was all along,

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.180
just like I knew where they kept theirs.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.590
They wouldn't have needed to kill grady.

01:16:56.630 --> 01:17:00.050
So that means I reckon
grady's still alive.

01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:05.480
Unfortunately,that means that,uh,grady's
the one who told you who R.J.And thumps are.

01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:07.470
Well,they're gonna figure that
out,too,when you catch them.

01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:10.680
They're not gonna like it,eitheR. See?

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:13.260
This time,I'm not running away.

01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:15.090
And,uh...

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.820
if things don't work out for me...

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.170
look after my little brother,will ya?

01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:23.990
And,uh...

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.980
say thanks to your mom and dad for...

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.250
for being so nice to me and all.

01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:37.480
Hope you get this message here.

01:17:38.370 --> 01:17:39.730
Okay.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.440
Got to run.

01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:50.730
How'd we find the wire?

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.680
Wesley called it in
himself three hours ago.

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:53.680
Told us where to look.

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:54.550
Sanchez picked it up.

01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:58.040
After we downloaded the camera,I
thought you should see this.

01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:02.410
What are we looking at now?

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:06.670
Coastal pacific savings -- two
blocks from the santa ana freeway.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.910
He left the camera right
across the street from it.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.900
That's -- that's not one
of the banks we're covering.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.290
It wasn't on wesley's route.

01:18:12.330 --> 01:18:16.710
Well,it was on arnie gillon's,and
there's about $400,000 on board.

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:20.130
Robbery/homicide is leading
eight-man teams at four other banks,

01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:24.090
S.I.S. Is fully deployed,and
nobody is in the right place?

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:24.820
Are you sure?

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:27.330
In addition to the wire that
we put on for detective ross,

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:30.140
we also embedded transmitters
in wesley's shoes.

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:34.130
The gps can't get a precise location,but
we've been tracking him all night long.

01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:35.650
First of all,he must
have obtained a vehicle.

01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:37.850
Then he drove into the
park la brea apartments.

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:39.160
Maybe looking for R.J.And thumps.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.130
Maybe going to pick up a stash gun.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.390
But then he did
something strange --

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.110
he went back to coastal pacific.

01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:45.480
Where he dropped the wire.

01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:46.540
That wasn't an accident.

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:49.460
I have undercover officers
looking for him right now.

01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:52.990
Wesley has a radius of more
than 100 yards in which to hide.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.880
You put transmitters on this kid
before you handed him off to ross,

01:18:55.930 --> 01:18:58.870
so you obviously suspected he
might do something like this.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.160
You had your doubts
about the confession.

01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:01.940
No. The confession
was good. It had gaps.

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:03.750
I was just covering our bases.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.620
Look,siR. If wesley wanted to
deal with thumps and R.J.Himself

01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:09.490
and save us the time
and the energy --

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:10.780
that was not my strategy,commandeR.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:13.490
I was providing emergency
backup in case it was needed.

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.720
And obviously it is.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.250
Look,have your team vest
up and get to this bank.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.760
Put your best shot on
the roof and out of sight.

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:29.830
Have him prepare to take out these
killers the moment they draw their weapons.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.530
Any change in wesley's whereabouts?

01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:36.140
No movement,chief.

01:19:37.410 --> 01:19:39.940
But I do see an astro van.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.600
Here comes provenza.

01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:46.690
Look around the target area,but
as inconspicuously as possible.

01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:48.870
If R.J.And thumps do
intend to rob the place,

01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:51.430
we don't want to tip
them off that we're there.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:54.630
Thank you.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.310
Inform the bank so that customers
are not let out during the period

01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:59.730
right before and after
the truck unloads.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:02.480
I don't want any more
innocent people shot.

01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:04.970
Search the area for wesley.

01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:07.250
If he's not moving,he has
to be hiding somewhere.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.970
Find him.

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.300
Get right on top of anybody
who seems vulnerable.

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:14.950
Don't leave anyone in
the open unprotected.

01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:20.560
Sanchez is in position.

01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:29.590
All right,the car's coming towards us.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.440
Chief,this is it.

01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:34.750
We want to catch them in the act.

01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:37.240
We don't want a gunfight
if it can be avoided.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.710
Let's take them down with
as little mess as possible.

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:46.500
Go ahead.

01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:51.700
Wait for it.

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.800
Wait for it.

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.120
Get on the floor!

01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:11.910
On the floor!

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.110
Get on the floor!

01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:15.040
On the ground!

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.750
Get on the ground!

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:18.050
Wesley!

01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:23.650
Wesley,drop your gun!

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.200
Drop your gun,wesley!

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:26.210
Get away from the caR.

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:28.230
Wesley,on the ground now!

01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:29.790
Drop your weapon,man!

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.340
Wesley!

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:50.730
Holster your gun!

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.860
L.A.P.D.! Drop your weapon!

01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:53.070
Drop your gun!

01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.900
L.A.P.D.!

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:54.910
Drop your weapon!

01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:56.990
Put your weapon on the ground now!

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:57.990
Now!

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.560
God!

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:36.980
your pants may needtaken up a little.

01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:40.220
I-it's all so much
--these,uh,these presents.

01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:41.810
I-I don't knowif I can keep it.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.540
Well,brenda and i made some
extra moneyselling the bungalow,

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:47.490
and she was afraid we might
havea little left oveR.

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.540
Well,when I see wes again,

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:51.770
I'll be sure to ask him if
it's okayif I keep everything.

01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:56.070
I know he's doing important
workfor the police,

01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:59.470
but do you think maybe
he'll --he'll call me today?

01:22:59.510 --> 01:23:01.180
Wes?

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.590
That's something you'll have
to talkto brenda leigh about.

01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:08.110
- Brenda!
- Grady.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.820
Grady,ask her at the restaurant.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:11.980
Right now,we got to get going.

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:13.910
Reservation's at 1:00.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.090
I can't believe I won't
becooking christmas dinneR.

01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:19.240
Brenda!Come on!

01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:26.160
Oh,do you thinkthis fancy beach
hotel would mindvaleting an R.V.

01:23:26.190 --> 01:23:28.730
I would love to see
themvalet the R.V.,Willie ray.

01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.200
Let's take it.

01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:32.350
Brenda!

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.340
Come on!

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.400
Y'all are being too nice,you know?

01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:40.490
Wesley --he
must be,uh...

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:43.700
must be some kind of hero,right?

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:47.300
In his own way,yes.

01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:49.610
And I think nowfor the rest of the day,

01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:55.510
we should all concentrateon
having a merry christmas.All right?

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:05.860
I'll talk to heR.

01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:26.520
Brenda.

01:24:30.710 --> 01:24:32.150
I'm -- I'm
notquite ready,okay?

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.800
I just --I just
need one minute.

01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:37.510
If you don'tpull it all together,grady's
gonna thinksomething's wrong.

01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:40.670
Something is wrong,daddy.

01:24:40.810 --> 01:24:44.090
I'm gonna have totell that boy
tomorrow that his brother's dead.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.290
No,you do not.

01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:50.270
You're gonna tell him that wesley
is workingwith the police undercover

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:54.570
until the kid gets
used tonot seeing him.

01:24:54.650 --> 01:24:56.760
How much longer do you
thinkgrady's gonna believe that?

01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:59.400
You told your motheryou
were a professional liaR.

01:24:59.450 --> 01:25:03.670
I think you couldfigure something
out to tell him,make him believe it.

01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:10.010
You...you have a tough job.

01:25:10.890 --> 01:25:14.210
You have to makehard decisions.

01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:19.640
But I guessif I would trust
anybody with makinghard decisions,

01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:21.810
it would bemy little girl.

01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:27.640
I try to dowhat's right.

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.460
I do.

01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:32.600
To the very bestof my ability.

01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:41.340
When you're packing
upthis place tomorrow...

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:43.620
we'll part company.

01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:47.360
Your mother and I wantto
take grady with us.

01:25:47.730 --> 01:25:53.320
We'll tell him it'sa witness-protection
program or something like that.

01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:56.800
Wesley was right.

01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:04.890
