00:00.945 --> 00:02.140
This is exciting for me.

00:02.174 --> 00:04.176
- I'm a comic.
- Great.

00:04.210 --> 00:06.644
- Do you have a business card?
- No.

00:06.712 --> 00:08.273
I'm fully kidding.

00:08.764 --> 00:12.186
Abraham and Isaac. Abraham had
the knife up in the air and

00:12.229 --> 00:16.453
and he heard a voice, thank God, or it
would've been, pptt, pptt, pptt.

00:16.546 --> 00:18.929
- You know I have to fire you, right?
- I figured.

00:19.117 --> 00:21.024
I just don't know if I can grow here.

00:21.527 --> 00:23.409
Why do you think we
shouldn't be together?

00:23.443 --> 00:25.808
- I'm in over my head.
- That is such a cop out.

00:25.870 --> 00:29.347
The second you missed your ex-girlfriend
you got little bored with me.

00:29.381 --> 00:32.777
In 10 years, you're going to
regret this so much.

00:32.831 --> 00:35.078
And I'm going to realize that I
dodged a fucking bullet.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.144
I think you know you'll die alone.

(KAT YESTERDAY "I NEED YOU TO CALL ME.
THIS IS UNFAIR.")

01:50.544 --> 01:53.677
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm here to meet Kevin Woods.

01:53.797 --> 01:55.664
Right this way.

02:01.733 --> 02:04.467
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.274
Good to see you, Peter.

02:09.804 --> 02:11.605
What is this place?

02:12.056 --> 02:14.256
It's my favorite restaurant.

02:16.493 --> 02:18.260
Molto Bene.

02:20.097 --> 02:21.743
What's up? What's going on?

02:22.566 --> 02:24.767
I heard about the Christian tour.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.036
Yeah.

02:27.501 --> 02:30.743
I... I don't know. I thought
it was one thing, and

02:31.344 --> 02:33.441
it was very restrictive.

02:33.790 --> 02:35.790
- It was a lot of money.
- I know.

02:36.513 --> 02:38.613
A lot of dates.

02:38.683 --> 02:39.748
Yeah.

02:39.817 --> 02:41.684
Well, I got some news.

02:50.008 --> 02:51.859
John Mulaney wants you to open for him.

02:53.024 --> 02:54.662
- Are you fucking with me?
- Nope.

02:54.731 --> 02:56.630
He asked for you by name.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.966
- John Mulaney?
- John Mulaney.

02:59.035 --> 03:00.534
- Asked for me?
- Mm-hmm.

03:00.603 --> 03:01.803
- By name?
- Yep.

03:01.871 --> 03:04.271
How did... We met one time.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.841
He must've seen me or something, right?

03:06.910 --> 03:08.843
That's the thing about
this business, Peter.

03:08.912 --> 03:11.412
You never know what's lurking
around the next corner.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.547
Most of the time,
it's a punch in the gut.

03:13.616 --> 03:15.316
Sometimes, it's a treasure chest.

03:15.384 --> 03:17.718
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

03:17.786 --> 03:20.353
All that training, all that grooming.

03:20.422 --> 03:21.755
This is your treasure chest.

03:21.824 --> 03:23.859
- That's amazing.
- You've been working really hard.

03:23.892 --> 03:25.658
- That's amazing.
- You know?

03:26.241 --> 03:28.695
You're ready for this.
This is your moment.

03:28.764 --> 03:30.230
- That's great.
- Mm-hmm.

03:30.298 --> 03:31.698
- You said yes?
- Mm-hmm.

03:31.767 --> 03:33.433
I thought you were just...

03:33.501 --> 03:35.969
I thought you just wanted
to fire me or...

03:36.038 --> 03:37.771
because of... this.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.873
God damn it.

03:40.909 --> 03:42.275
Let's get some cake.

03:42.344 --> 03:45.411
I know. I know! He just told me.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.014
It was like a whole thing.
He sat me down...

03:48.083 --> 03:50.683
Ali, it's, uh, it's Pete.

03:50.752 --> 03:52.852
Um, listen, I just found out
I'm doing a show,

03:52.920 --> 03:55.288
Saturday at Town Hall.

03:55.357 --> 03:58.591
John... That's right, Kid Gorgeous.

03:58.660 --> 04:00.793
And me, Kid Regular.

04:00.862 --> 04:04.497
Asked for me by name.

04:04.566 --> 04:05.934
You know, we haven't talked in a while.

04:05.967 --> 04:07.634
I miss you. I wanna hang out.

04:07.702 --> 04:09.369
So, um, I hope you can make it.

04:16.577 --> 04:17.779
Hey, Pete.

04:17.812 --> 04:19.845
I'm so excited for you, about Mulaney.

04:19.914 --> 04:21.147
That's so awesome!

04:21.214 --> 04:23.783
He never did anything
for me except bump me,

04:23.851 --> 04:25.850
but I'm not bitter about it. Ha-ha.

04:25.919 --> 04:28.052
I'm really sorry.
I can't make it to your show,

04:28.121 --> 04:31.956
because, um, Ted and I broke up.

04:32.025 --> 04:36.428
Ugh, he was just so perfect
in all of the wrong ways.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.598
So, uh, yeah...

04:39.667 --> 04:42.501
if you need me, I'll be on my couch,

04:42.569 --> 04:44.503
watching The Great British Bake Off,

04:44.571 --> 04:47.739
contemplating how I'm gonna die alone.

04:47.808 --> 04:50.309
All right, have a good show.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.876
Bye.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.113
Bye.

05:49.634 --> 05:51.267
You did it.

05:51.336 --> 05:53.670
You really did it.

05:53.739 --> 05:55.672
You belong here.

05:55.741 --> 05:57.139
You belong here.

05:59.944 --> 06:02.344
You got this.

06:03.046 --> 06:04.546
Look at me.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.682
You're special. You deserve this.

06:06.751 --> 06:10.118
That's why he asked for you,
because you can do it.

06:10.187 --> 06:12.153
Hello?

06:12.222 --> 06:14.690
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi! Oh my God! Hi!

06:14.759 --> 06:16.324
- Are we intruding?
- Not at all.

06:16.394 --> 06:18.126
- Congratulations!
- Welcome! Yes.

06:18.195 --> 06:19.995
- Hi!
- We're so proud of you!

06:20.063 --> 06:21.563
Oh my God, I'm so glad you're here!

06:21.632 --> 06:22.931
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.233
This goes great
with my dressing room mirror.

06:25.302 --> 06:29.337
I'll put them... No vase.
They're lovely.

06:29.407 --> 06:31.172
Remember, you're swimming right now.

06:31.241 --> 06:33.208
Enjoy it, Peter.
Don't grab for the water, man.

06:33.277 --> 06:36.744
Relax and just float. This is awesome.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.679
That was strangely coherent.

06:38.748 --> 06:39.814
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

06:39.883 --> 06:41.982
That was... What's happening today?

06:42.051 --> 06:43.518
I'm in a suit, I'm in a green room,

06:43.586 --> 06:45.653
he's making sense. This is magic.

06:45.722 --> 06:47.422
- Really exciting.
- Hey.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.223
- I'm Justin. I work with John.
- Oh, hi.

06:49.292 --> 06:51.325
When you get a chance,
John wants to say hi.

06:51.394 --> 06:53.327
- Oh!
- Oh, fancy!

06:53.396 --> 06:55.062
- Well, go say hi.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:55.131 --> 06:56.631
Enjoy. There's Jelly Bellys.

06:56.699 --> 06:58.134
- Oh great!
- Ronald Reagan's favorite.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.366
Open that up if you want.

06:59.436 --> 07:01.969
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

07:02.038 --> 07:05.205
- Whoa. What do you want?
- Not Jelly Bellys.

07:08.510 --> 07:10.544
I love these old theaters.

07:10.612 --> 07:12.011
Sorry.

07:17.285 --> 07:19.285
This is incredible. I love it.

07:19.354 --> 07:20.687
Yeah.

07:21.957 --> 07:24.691
Does it, um...
Does it ever get old or...?

07:24.760 --> 07:26.025
No.

07:29.064 --> 07:31.598
Hey, John. I've got Pete here for you.

07:34.703 --> 07:36.536
Hi.

07:36.605 --> 07:38.738
Good to see you.

07:39.842 --> 07:41.373
You too.

07:42.376 --> 07:44.009
Who are you?

07:44.078 --> 07:46.979
Pete Holmes. I'm wearing a suit, maybe.

07:47.047 --> 07:48.881
Remember, we met a Rafifi.

07:48.950 --> 07:50.683
- Oh.
- Yeah, yeah. On 11th.

07:50.751 --> 07:52.451
Out of sight.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.019
I just, um...

07:54.088 --> 07:56.655
I wanted to come back,
and I don't want to bother you.

07:56.724 --> 07:58.526
I just want to say
it's wonderful to be opening

07:58.559 --> 08:00.092
for somebody of your caliber,

08:00.160 --> 08:03.462
and just a dream come true, and it's...

08:03.531 --> 08:08.400
It's an honor, and Town Hall, I mean...

08:11.005 --> 08:13.472
When you say, "Open for me..."

08:13.541 --> 08:17.675
I just mean emcee, not open.
I'm just the supporting act.

08:18.586 --> 08:21.113
Why are you saying this?
Why are you saying that?

08:21.181 --> 08:23.215
Yeah, whatever term you want to use.

08:23.283 --> 08:26.251
I'm the "special guest."
I'm your special guest tonight.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.853
- And that's a thrill.
- Uh...

08:28.922 --> 08:30.688
- He's your opener, John.
- Yeah, opener.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.725
- Who the fuck's my opener?
- This is the opener.

08:34.553 --> 08:35.960
This is not what I asked for.

08:36.030 --> 08:37.865
You asked for Pete Holmes.
This is Pete Holmes.

08:37.898 --> 08:39.366
I could not have asked for Pete Holmes,

08:39.400 --> 08:41.299
because I do not know
who Pete Holmes is.

08:41.368 --> 08:42.833
I'm Pete Holmes. Remember we...

08:42.903 --> 08:44.403
I know that now.

08:44.471 --> 08:48.306
I wanted Holmes, the
comedian, from Chicago.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.041
They got Holmes from Chicago,

08:50.109 --> 08:51.909
from the Chicago Comedy Festival.

08:51.977 --> 08:53.944
He was super funny,
we were on the same show,

08:54.013 --> 08:55.431
then we went to Alinea
together, they closed

08:55.464 --> 08:58.105
- the kitchen, we ate at chef's counter.
- I didn't go to Alinea with you.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.284
I know, we didn't invite
you, but I told you...

09:00.353 --> 09:01.952
The guy, Holmes...

09:02.021 --> 09:03.554
- Ugh. Ben Holmes?
- Yes!

09:03.622 --> 09:05.222
- Ben Holmes. Okay.
- Ben Holmes!

09:05.291 --> 09:07.660
- Ben Holmes. You wanted Ben Holmes.
- Ben Holmes is opening tonight.

09:07.693 --> 09:09.793
- Okay, okay, okay.
- He's opening tonight.

09:09.862 --> 09:11.762
No, he's in Chicago.

09:11.830 --> 09:14.498
Ben Holmes is not here,
and Pete Holmes is here?

09:14.567 --> 09:15.766
Yes.

09:15.834 --> 09:18.769
Sounds like there's been
a little bit of confusion. Ugh.

09:18.837 --> 09:22.405
It's most likely because
we have the same surname.

09:22.474 --> 09:25.542
Oh, do you fucking think,
Agatha Christie?

09:25.610 --> 09:27.528
I'm gonna fix this.
We're gonna fix this.

09:27.561 --> 09:29.757
- This is totally fine... totally fine.
- Okay.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.715
All right, what does one...

09:33.560 --> 09:35.518
What does one do?

09:35.587 --> 09:37.689
I'm sure you can call somebody
else. There's plenty of time.

09:37.722 --> 09:39.522
We can form a list
and think of comedians,

09:39.591 --> 09:41.460
- other comedians that could open.
- Okay, we'll make a list.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.095
- A list of New York City comedians.
- Yes, okay.

09:43.128 --> 09:45.161
A list of comedians in New York City.

09:45.230 --> 09:47.466
- I've got a note open, yes.
- Do it in this order, okay?

09:47.499 --> 09:49.832
Ron Funches. He's third, okay?

09:49.901 --> 09:51.731
Jon Stewart... I know
that sounds like a reach,

09:51.764 --> 09:53.203
but maybe if you pitch it as like,

09:53.271 --> 09:55.020
"Oh, this would be so crazy
if you showed up," all right?

09:55.053 --> 09:57.439
First, Birbiglia.
He's too big to open for me,

09:57.508 --> 09:59.177
but he's a friend.
He might do it as a favor.

09:59.210 --> 10:01.410
If he says he's not
in New York, he is lying.

10:21.132 --> 10:23.565
Jesus fucking Christ.

10:23.894 --> 10:25.240
Kevin, it's Pete.

10:25.373 --> 10:28.286
There's a mix-up. They booked
the wrong fucking guy.

10:28.472 --> 10:30.141
I don't know where you are.
I'm at the theater.

10:30.174 --> 10:32.974
You gotta fucking call me.
It's fucked up.

10:40.111 --> 10:42.944
Pete, can I talk to you for a second?

10:49.967 --> 10:51.960
Shut the... shut the door.

10:53.997 --> 10:56.198
Have a seat for a minute.

10:58.669 --> 11:01.803
Uh, I'm really sorry.

11:01.872 --> 11:04.938
Uh, no. This is a...

11:05.225 --> 11:06.974
This is a big deal. This is Town Hall,

11:07.043 --> 11:09.577
and I would want my show
to be perfect too.

11:09.637 --> 11:11.458
It was... Yeah. It threw me. I...

11:11.701 --> 11:15.015
...acted like a jerk, and, you know,

11:15.084 --> 11:18.144
as you know and as you'll tell
people, I'm not a jerk.

11:19.789 --> 11:22.022
I don't...
I'm not gonna talk about this.

11:22.091 --> 11:23.411
It's not a bad... I don't even...

11:23.459 --> 11:26.494
Oh, I'm not telling you
not to talk about it.

11:26.563 --> 11:29.063
- I didn't say that.
- No, but I won't.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.099
Yeah, it's like the story
could be that I'm an asshole,

11:32.168 --> 11:35.135
and, you know, that's not the story.

11:37.144 --> 11:39.173
You know, it's Town Hall.

11:39.473 --> 11:41.108
You can't shoot to wound.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.011
You gotta shoot to kill.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.871
Oh, it's Birbiglia.

11:46.043 --> 11:47.447
Hey.

12:14.675 --> 12:15.875
Hey, Pete.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.077
- Oh, hey, man.
- Hey.

12:18.980 --> 12:21.313
We're gonna need you
to clear out of here.

12:21.382 --> 12:24.050
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course. I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.385
No, we're sorry.

12:27.856 --> 12:29.856
I didn't touch most of this.

12:44.005 --> 12:46.639
We'll get a new one.
Just, uh, follow me out here.

12:50.309 --> 12:53.245
Should I go? I kind of feel
like I should get out of here.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.147
No, stay, stay. Literally stay.

12:55.215 --> 12:58.116
You're here, just watch
the show, you know?

12:58.185 --> 13:00.419
Okay, is there a seat
in the house, or...?

13:00.488 --> 13:03.689
Well, no. Um, but you can
watch from backstage.

13:03.758 --> 13:07.092
You'll be a VIP, our very important
guest. John's very important guest.

13:07.473 --> 13:09.094
Yeah, I'll watch from wherever, sure.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.730
- Fuck!
- I've got to take care of this.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.101
- John, anything?
- Ron Funches is in Denver.

13:16.473 --> 13:19.244
I called Gethard, and he said he would
try to be here by eight o'clock,

13:19.277 --> 13:21.275
and it's almost eight o'clock, so
I don't think he's gonna be here.

13:21.308 --> 13:23.580
- So Gethard will not be here?
- Gethard will not be here.

13:23.613 --> 13:25.934
Okay. Fuck! I'm not mad at you.

13:36.889 --> 13:39.089
How many minutes can you do?

13:40.327 --> 13:42.760
- I could do 20.
- You'll do 10.

13:42.829 --> 13:44.261
So are we doing this?

13:44.331 --> 13:45.797
Yeah.

13:47.734 --> 13:50.868
Aah, fuck, it's happening.

13:50.937 --> 13:52.036
Take that, Justin.

13:52.104 --> 13:53.437
The show is about to happen.

13:53.505 --> 13:55.339
It's not not going to happen.

13:55.407 --> 13:56.940
God, I hate doing stand-up.

13:57.008 --> 13:59.075
I hate doing stand-up comedy so much.

13:59.144 --> 14:00.977
I only wanted to be
a comedian my whole life,

14:01.046 --> 14:03.714
and the thing I hate the most
is stand-up comedy.

14:03.782 --> 14:05.114
Hey, are you clean?

14:05.183 --> 14:07.050
Uh, yeah, I'm... I'm a clean...

14:07.118 --> 14:08.918
No, you gotta be dirty.

14:08.987 --> 14:10.387
That way my parents will hate you,

14:10.456 --> 14:12.389
and when I walk out I seem clean.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.517
I'm not a clean comic.
People think I am,

14:14.551 --> 14:16.559
but I say "dick" and "ass" and "cocaine"

14:16.595 --> 14:18.315
- and all this stuff.
- Okay, I'll be dirty.

14:18.364 --> 14:19.632
- Yeah, be dirty.
- A little dirty.

14:19.665 --> 14:21.365
Also, don't mention marriage.

14:21.433 --> 14:22.566
Don't mention adolescence.

14:22.634 --> 14:24.668
A lot of it is about adolescence.

14:24.737 --> 14:27.603
Well, then you don't do that,
you do something else.

14:27.672 --> 14:31.207
Or you just say, "Welcome,
I'm the venue owner,"

14:31.276 --> 14:33.076
and then you walk off.

14:34.479 --> 14:37.213
- All right.
- Look...

14:37.282 --> 14:39.415
don't be bad.

14:39.484 --> 14:44.120
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Ben Holmes!

15:05.842 --> 15:08.043
Speak!

15:09.346 --> 15:10.779
Speak!

15:21.358 --> 15:24.092
Um, sorry.

15:24.161 --> 15:25.994
It's actually, it's Pete.

15:26.063 --> 15:29.031
Yeah.

15:29.099 --> 15:31.400
My name is, um...

15:31.468 --> 15:33.635
Pete Holmes.

15:33.703 --> 15:35.703
It's okay.

15:35.772 --> 15:37.906
There was a... There was a mix-up.

15:37.974 --> 15:40.274
I'm not Ben Holmes, I'm Pete Holmes.

15:40.343 --> 15:43.277
I mean, there was a whole thing.

15:43.346 --> 15:47.114
It turns out John Mulaney,
who we're all here to see,

15:47.183 --> 15:49.464
um, wanted Ben Holmes,

15:49.498 --> 15:53.655
but they got in touch with my
manager and they got Pete Holmes,

15:53.731 --> 15:57.232
and then I got here and John was...

15:57.293 --> 15:59.427
He was not cool about it.

15:59.472 --> 16:02.087
I'm not...

16:02.121 --> 16:06.089
I'm not saying he's a dick.
He's not a dick.

16:06.128 --> 16:09.904
I'm saying we all have moments
where we slip into dick.

16:11.276 --> 16:12.930
And he...

16:12.964 --> 16:15.682
He slipped into dick. I know!

16:17.279 --> 16:20.547
What a nightmare for me,
because he was upset.

16:20.616 --> 16:23.316
He had this important show.
I get it, I get it, I get it.

16:23.385 --> 16:24.952
I get it. I really get it.

16:25.020 --> 16:30.624
But he was calling other
comedians in front of me.

16:30.693 --> 16:33.393
- Sorry I'm late, man.
- Is that Chris Gethard?

16:33.462 --> 16:35.462
- Yeah, it's me.
- Where the fuck were you?

16:35.531 --> 16:38.799
I was having, you know,
dinner with my wife.

16:38.868 --> 16:40.636
And that's, hopefully,
why you're dressed like that.

16:40.669 --> 16:43.003
And they're calling like,
"Mike Birbiglia, we need you!"

16:43.071 --> 16:45.405
And I'm like...

16:45.474 --> 16:47.006
But I don't understand.

16:47.068 --> 16:51.711
My job is to just not be
as good as the headliner.

16:51.779 --> 16:55.200
Brother, if you're looking

16:55.239 --> 16:57.917
for someone to be not as good
as John Mulaney,

16:57.986 --> 17:00.586
I'm your first call.

17:00.655 --> 17:05.892
I am mediocre and forgettable
together, like two great tastes.

17:08.145 --> 17:10.163
- Hey, Greer.
- Hey. Am I too late?

17:10.232 --> 17:13.133
Uh, no, the show hasn't started yet.

17:13.201 --> 17:14.800
Yes, you're too late.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.877
I'm basically an open Mic-er
who does some road work,

17:18.911 --> 17:21.342
and my manager was like, "John
Mulaney asked for you by name."

17:21.375 --> 17:23.342
And I was like, "That checks out."

17:25.279 --> 17:27.378
He doesn't even know me!

17:27.439 --> 17:30.007
He doesn't know me. We met once,

17:30.091 --> 17:31.891
and, you know, he was
kind of a dick then too.

17:31.927 --> 17:33.352
He was dick then.

17:33.421 --> 17:34.987
You are a dick.

17:35.381 --> 17:37.523
I know, but people don't know that.

17:38.192 --> 17:40.693
Town Hall, thank you so much.

17:40.762 --> 17:43.863
What a dream come true.
Thank you, Mulaney.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.905
Are you guys ready for your headliner?

17:48.436 --> 17:51.850
I am, too. This is obviously
the person we all came to see.

17:51.912 --> 17:54.873
You know him, you love him.
Town Hall, give a big welcome

17:54.942 --> 17:57.341
to John Mulaney!

18:01.514 --> 18:04.716
- You're not bad.
- Really? I thought...

18:04.785 --> 18:07.619
- I have to go do it. Thank you.
- Right.

18:07.806 --> 18:10.488
Pete Holmes, ladies and gentlemen.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.192
- Good show, dude.
- Thanks, man.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.260
- I love your stuff.
- Thanks.

18:16.336 --> 18:18.336
- Not bad, man. Not bad at all.
- Thank you, Greer.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.764
Hello, I'm John Mulaney.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.067
You may know me
from some of Pete's stories

18:22.135 --> 18:24.619
from five seconds ago.

18:24.673 --> 18:27.871
I got to admit, Pete Holmes
was kind of right about me.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.666
I was a dick to him this evening,

18:30.744 --> 18:32.337
and I do apologize.

18:32.431 --> 18:36.046
I'm embarrassed that you have
seen the darker side of me.

18:36.361 --> 18:40.751
But in terms of dark sides of male
comedians coming to light this year,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.552
I think that's a pretty tame one.

18:42.622 --> 18:46.123
But...

18:49.061 --> 18:51.528
I want to be a good, nice person.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.965
I was raised Catholic, I was
raised to be kind to everyone.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.001
You know, Catholicism is
all about kindness

18:57.069 --> 18:59.703
until you go digging into it,
and then it's not at all.

19:01.173 --> 19:04.073
There's a new Pope,
and people like him a lot.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.042
Pope Francis, people think he's cool.

19:06.111 --> 19:08.545
Like, look at all of you.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.912
You're clapping for him,

19:09.981 --> 19:11.914
and he's against abortion
and all of your rights,

19:11.983 --> 19:13.617
but you like him.

19:13.685 --> 19:17.521
The pope is popular, 'cause he
acts like a sophomore in college

19:17.589 --> 19:20.524
who just took mushrooms
for the first time.

19:20.592 --> 19:24.194
He'll be like,
"Maybe God is just an energy,

19:24.263 --> 19:26.563
not some man with a son."

19:26.632 --> 19:30.967
And everyone's like,
"Whoa, Catholicism's cool!"

19:31.036 --> 19:32.735
It's not!

19:32.804 --> 19:36.372
This is a trick to lure
you Jews and atheists

19:36.440 --> 19:38.808
into our weird Italian religion.

19:40.411 --> 19:44.313
Here's how you'll know if the Pope
ever really shakes things up.

19:44.382 --> 19:46.482
He'll die.

19:46.551 --> 19:48.280
If the pope was ever like, "Hey, I just"

19:48.314 --> 19:50.219
realized that we could
cure world hunger"

19:50.254 --> 19:52.655
if we sold some
of these gold cathedrals."

19:52.724 --> 19:57.293
The next day they'd be like,
"Oh, no! The Pope died!

19:57.485 --> 20:01.430
Yeah, he had a heart attack.
He fell down the stairs."

20:01.499 --> 20:04.500
"I'm sorry. He had a heart attack
or he fell down the stairs?"

20:04.569 --> 20:06.135
"I know!"

20:12.810 --> 20:15.043
- Hey! Oh my God!
- Amazing!

20:15.112 --> 20:16.544
I'm so glad you saw that.

20:16.613 --> 20:19.214
Oh my goodness, that looked
so cathartic for you.

20:19.282 --> 20:23.741
Yes, it was. It was...
tense, fucking crazy,

20:23.881 --> 20:25.956
but out there, I mean, it was all...
it was worth it.

20:25.989 --> 20:29.357
You took all that weird anger
you have inside yourself,

20:29.426 --> 20:31.793
and then you totally transformed it,

20:31.862 --> 20:34.662
and you gave it these folks
and you just made them laugh

20:34.732 --> 20:36.798
and turned it into positivity, Peter!

20:36.867 --> 20:38.466
Yeah, it was great.

20:38.535 --> 20:40.869
Um, John, sorry. Would you mind?

20:40.938 --> 20:42.870
These are my, uh, these are my guests.

20:42.939 --> 20:44.372
- This is Jess.
- Hello.

20:44.456 --> 20:46.021
- And this is Leif.
- Hi.

20:46.075 --> 20:48.212
- And this is John Mulaney.
- I'm John Mulaney. Nice to meet you.

20:48.245 --> 20:49.946
- Hi. John Mulaney.
- Uh, this is Greer Barnes.

20:49.979 --> 20:51.112
- "Leif," you said?
- Yeah.

20:51.180 --> 20:53.381
- Greer. Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

20:53.450 --> 20:56.551
You were so funny. I couldn't breathe.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.919
- Thank you.
- Y'all brothers and sisters?

20:58.988 --> 21:02.290
Lot of people think that,
but no, we are lovers.

21:02.359 --> 21:03.791
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

21:03.860 --> 21:05.395
She said she liked comedy,
so I wanted to see

21:05.428 --> 21:07.428
if she wanted to come to the late show.

21:07.497 --> 21:10.431
- Oh, there's another show?
- I think it's a euphemism.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.367
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, we gotta go.

21:12.435 --> 21:13.934
- You gotta go. Thank you.
- Okay.

21:14.003 --> 21:15.867
I'm being pulled away now.

21:15.914 --> 21:17.860
- You guys were great.
- Nice meeting you.

21:17.938 --> 21:21.408
I really liked this.
This was really fun, thank you.

21:21.477 --> 21:23.210
- I really liked it. Okay.
- Okay.

21:23.279 --> 21:25.479
Bye, guys. Thank you for coming.
Hey, John.

21:25.547 --> 21:29.083
Um, I just feel like I should apologize
for some of the things I said.

21:29.152 --> 21:32.286
- I wanna make sure it was okay.
- Pete, you were funny.

21:32.354 --> 21:34.621
You made the show better. Okay? Relax.

21:34.690 --> 21:36.356
What are you doing right now?

21:36.425 --> 21:39.393
- Nothing, I mean this is it.
- You want come to The Cellar with us?

21:39.461 --> 21:40.727
- Come on.
- Yeah.

21:40.797 --> 21:42.963
We gotta unwind after the show.

21:43.032 --> 21:44.799
Yeah. I mean. Really? You don't mind?

21:44.867 --> 21:47.601
I've already invited you! Say, "Yes."

21:49.171 --> 21:50.469
Yeah.

22:01.149 --> 22:02.581
What's up, man?

22:05.120 --> 22:06.719
- Pete Holmes.
- How are you?

22:06.788 --> 22:08.754
- Lookin' good, brother.
- Thanks, dude.

22:10.158 --> 22:13.586
Hold on, I can't sit back there
'cause I don't play here.

22:13.703 --> 22:15.583
It's not gonna be a problem.
I'll talk to Estee.

22:16.064 --> 22:17.596
Hey, Estee.

22:17.665 --> 22:19.199
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

22:19.275 --> 22:21.042
- How are you, John?
- How are you?

22:21.102 --> 22:24.036
It's so good to see you. Wonderful.

22:24.104 --> 22:25.640
Wonderful to see you.

22:25.687 --> 22:28.941
- What's happening?
- Uh, I did Town Hall tonight.

22:29.009 --> 22:30.776
Oh, I heard. How was it?

22:30.845 --> 22:32.244
It was amazing.

22:32.313 --> 22:34.213
- Really?
- It was really, really cool.

22:34.281 --> 22:38.015
When I was standing on stage,
I thought, it is all thanks to Estee.

22:38.117 --> 22:40.419
Well, I'm glad I gave you first shot,

22:40.488 --> 22:42.955
but your talent took you
to where you are.

22:43.031 --> 22:46.199
I know I have talent. But, no,
really you gave me the opportunity.

22:46.260 --> 22:47.993
Listen to the guy. Okay.

22:48.062 --> 22:50.491
Speaking of, someone
opened for me tonight,

22:50.554 --> 22:52.132
a guy I'd never seen before.

22:52.166 --> 22:55.901
Uh, he was hilarious.
Do you know Pete Holmes?

22:57.569 --> 22:59.171
This guy hovering, right here?

22:59.240 --> 23:01.306
I'm sorry, I just...
We came in together.

23:01.375 --> 23:03.375
I know I'm not supposed
to sit there, but...

23:03.443 --> 23:05.610
Look, I didn't like him either
when I first met him,

23:05.679 --> 23:07.379
and I was pretty rude to him.

23:07.447 --> 23:10.249
And then he got on stage, and he killed.

23:10.317 --> 23:12.617
And I feel like I owe him something.

23:12.686 --> 23:15.754
And if you could give him
a spot, that would be amazing.

23:16.129 --> 23:18.390
Honestly, I just...
We're just hanging out.

23:18.458 --> 23:20.125
I didn't... I didn't ask him to do this.

23:20.194 --> 23:21.559
I... I'm happy...

23:21.761 --> 23:24.997
All right, he can go on next.
Only because you asked.

23:25.532 --> 23:27.933
- Thank you, Estee.
- You're welcome.

23:32.505 --> 23:34.205
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:34.274 --> 23:36.673
I... thank both of you.

23:37.443 --> 23:40.811
I gotta work on my set.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.546
- I'm performing!
- You gotta earn that.

23:42.615 --> 23:44.848
- She said I'm going up!
- Sit over there!

23:44.918 --> 23:46.613
The longer you sit here,
the worse it gets.

23:46.647 --> 23:48.128
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Come on.

23:48.162 --> 23:50.216
- Go work on it alone.
- Take care of yourself.

23:50.250 --> 23:52.613
- You have to do this alone.
- Honestly...

23:52.918 --> 23:56.015
You know, honestly, be careful,
because she hates him.

23:56.418 --> 23:59.897
I vouched for him once, and now she
won't let me vouch for anybody.

23:59.966 --> 24:02.900
Oh my God, and most people trust you.

24:05.003 --> 24:07.438
I know, it's hilarious.

24:07.506 --> 24:09.940
Are you guys ready for some more?

24:10.008 --> 24:12.378
This next brother coming to the
stage, you are gonna love him.

24:12.411 --> 24:14.891
Very funny. Give it up for the
one and only Pete Holmes, y'all.

24:14.947 --> 24:17.714
Clap it up for Pete Holmes, y'all!

24:17.783 --> 24:19.550
Come on, show your love!

24:21.386 --> 24:23.720
Show your love for that brother.

24:25.624 --> 24:28.358
Keep it going for Mike Yard,
everybody. That's Mike Yard.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.167
It's weird, uh, it's weird to be here.

24:37.465 --> 24:40.103
"It's great to be here,"
is what I'm supposed to say,

24:40.316 --> 24:42.705
but it's weird because
the last time I was here,

24:42.774 --> 24:44.774
I broke up with my girlfriend.

24:44.843 --> 24:46.042
Aw!

24:46.111 --> 24:48.345
Wow, good for you.

24:48.413 --> 24:50.580
You're not sociopaths.
That's very healthy.

24:51.756 --> 24:54.017
I'll tell you, the main
difference between being single

24:54.086 --> 24:56.019
and having a girlfriend,
for me, in the city,

24:56.088 --> 24:58.355
is missing the train.

24:58.423 --> 25:00.390
When I'm single... Listen to me now.

25:00.459 --> 25:02.359
When I'm single, I don't miss it.

25:02.427 --> 25:03.860
I make it. Just a free man,

25:03.928 --> 25:06.997
just one free man with agency
and free will, I make it.

25:07.065 --> 25:09.966
I hear it through the grate,
and I assess its direction

25:10.042 --> 25:12.393
like a herd of buffalo
that I'm stalking.

25:12.471 --> 25:15.371
I'm right on the stairs. I tear
my shirt open a little bit

25:15.439 --> 25:19.008
just to feel more like a man...
...and I make it.

25:19.052 --> 25:20.822
Two at a time on the stairs.

25:20.877 --> 25:24.013
That's a leap. I'm leaping...
I'm leaping down the stairs.

25:24.081 --> 25:28.183
I get my metro card out strong,
I'm swiping in down the stairs.

25:28.252 --> 25:30.088
Before the doors close,
I have time to get my hat

25:30.121 --> 25:31.786
that I dropped like Indiana Jones,

25:31.855 --> 25:35.090
put it on, light a cigarette,
kiss a woman I don't know.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.092
I make it!

25:37.370 --> 25:40.035
But when I had a girlfriend,
I never made it. I never made it.

25:40.090 --> 25:42.431
I'm already swiped through,
'cause I get my metro card out

25:42.465 --> 25:43.698
on the stairs.

25:43.741 --> 25:45.722
She gets to the thing...
To the turnstyle,

25:45.871 --> 25:49.537
she's opening her bag
to retrieve another bag.

25:51.241 --> 25:55.976
She's got a bag within a bag,
Russian-doll system of baggery.

25:56.142 --> 25:58.379
She's got all these dead metro cards.

25:58.448 --> 26:00.481
Why does she keep the dead metro cards?

26:00.550 --> 26:03.751
Are you scrapbooking?

26:10.760 --> 26:13.294
Sit. Please.

26:16.666 --> 26:18.299
So...

26:18.368 --> 26:21.969
the show downstairs was... good.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.505
You can call in for spots.

26:25.574 --> 26:27.107
- Holy shit!
- Really?

26:27.176 --> 26:28.756
- Pete!
- Yeah, look at that.

26:28.789 --> 26:32.052
Congrats, I suppose. But, Estee,
are you sure about this?

26:32.086 --> 26:33.104
Come on, man.

26:33.138 --> 26:34.783
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on, Dan.

26:34.816 --> 26:37.117
The question is,
is Pete ready to be here?

26:37.186 --> 26:38.754
- That's the question.
- He's here!

26:38.787 --> 26:41.054
Are you suggesting
I should get rid of somebody?

26:41.123 --> 26:43.023
- You get rid of Dan.
- Yeah.

26:43.070 --> 26:44.726
You can't get rid of me.
I've been here for 10 years.

26:44.759 --> 26:47.271
- Yes, you can.
- I think at least he should reaudition.

26:47.305 --> 26:49.029
- Give this up to Pete.
- Reaudition him.

26:49.063 --> 26:51.772
I reaudition every night
when I'm killing down there.

26:51.833 --> 26:53.239
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

26:53.273 --> 26:54.427
- Thank you.
- No, you don't.

26:54.460 --> 26:55.614
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

26:55.647 --> 26:56.840
No, you don't.

26:57.737 --> 26:59.274
What do you guys wanna do? Wanna go eat?

26:59.307 --> 27:01.673
- Yeah, why not.
- Yeah, I could eat.

27:01.742 --> 27:03.775
Pete, you wanna come eat with us?

27:06.013 --> 27:07.679
I'm sorry, I can't. I...

27:08.716 --> 27:10.549
I gotta go. Thank you.

27:10.618 --> 27:11.984
You're welcome.

27:12.052 --> 27:14.052
He's an odd duck.

27:14.122 --> 27:15.454
I was just trying to be polite.

27:15.523 --> 27:17.523
To be honest, I think we're better off.
