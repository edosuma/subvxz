09:34.114 --> 09:34.980
all that all along!"

09:35.020 --> 09:35.379
It's a classic.

09:35.419 --> 09:36.799
You've got to watch it.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.380
I'll put it on my list.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
f

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000

10:52.418 --> 10:52.980
-[birds cawing]

10:53.020 --> 10:53.943
[Nicky] Wow, so this was

10:53.983 --> 10:54.980
taken on their first date?

10:55.020 --> 10:57.172
Yeah, that's why I wanted this

10:57.212 --> 10:58.980
place to be my first pub.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.141
I thought it would be nice

11:00.181 --> 11:00.516
to come for a drink

11:00.556 --> 11:00.980
here with Dad.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.000
Oh, is he coming down?

11:04.000 --> 11:04.980
Oh, sort of.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.980
You're leaning on him.

11:07.020 --> 11:07.803
[gasps] Oh, God!

11:07.843 --> 11:09.223
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

11:10.000 --> 11:10.980
Oh, my God. I... I...

11:11.020 --> 11:12.187
You don't need to apologize

11:12.227 --> 11:12.980
to him. He's dead.

11:13.020 --> 11:13.619
-He can't hear you.

11:13.659 --> 11:14.319
-[chuckles]

11:18.000 --> 11:19.980
You want to ask me, don't you?

11:20.020 --> 11:21.000
Ask you...

11:22.000 --> 11:23.451
Why this is my first time

11:23.491 --> 11:23.980
in a pub?

11:24.020 --> 11:25.980
Or in those shoes?

11:26.020 --> 11:28.286
Or why the only four films,

11:28.326 --> 11:28.892
I've seen in my life

11:28.932 --> 11:29.980
are  Terminator 2,

11:30.020 --> 11:31.225
Shawshank Redemption,

11:31.265 --> 11:32.980
Home Alone 2  and  Braveheart.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.520
Yeah, no, I do, actually.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.182
I'm afraid I've got some

11:37.222 --> 11:38.182
bad news, Nicky.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Kim?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Kim?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.015
It's your turn to disembowel

12:15.055 --> 12:16.615
dinner when you got a sec.

12:23.000 --> 12:23.980
Kim?

12:24.020 --> 12:25.000
d

12:40.000 --> 12:40.980
[Kim]  Dear Mum.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.392
I'm sorry for leaving,

12:42.432 --> 12:43.234
but I knew that you would

12:43.274 --> 12:44.234
try and stop me.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
The thing is,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.033
I finally feel ready

12:49.073 --> 12:50.153
to try new things.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.542
Work out what's out there

12:52.582 --> 12:52.980
for me.

12:53.020 --> 12:54.980
And make things right...

12:55.020 --> 12:56.000
for Dad.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
For all of us.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.980
I'm not a little girl anymore.

13:02.020 --> 13:04.000
I can look after myself, Mum.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
The world is a scary place.

13:08.000 --> 13:08.562
-[whirring]

13:08.602 --> 13:08.980
-[gasps]

13:09.020 --> 13:10.640
But it is just like he said

13:11.000 --> 13:12.770
in that beautiful poem he wrote

13:12.810 --> 13:13.980
for my 21st birthday.

13:14.020 --> 13:15.980
I've got all my life to live.

13:16.020 --> 13:17.980
And all my love to give.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.257
And as long as I know

13:19.297 --> 13:19.980
how to love.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.400
I know I'll stay alive.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I will survive, Mum.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Love, Kim.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.480
So just to be clear,

13:42.520 --> 13:43.019
the end of the world

13:43.059 --> 13:43.980
is coming tomorrow?

13:44.020 --> 13:45.298
No. I'm saying it could

13:45.338 --> 13:45.980
be tomorrow,

13:46.020 --> 13:47.980
but when it does happen,

13:48.020 --> 13:48.891
the more off grid you are

13:48.931 --> 13:49.980
the better chance you'll have.

13:50.020 --> 13:51.042
-So how's it gonna happen?

13:51.082 --> 13:51.980
-Nuclear war, probably.

13:52.020 --> 13:52.582
-Oh.

13:52.622 --> 13:53.354
-But it could be

13:53.394 --> 13:54.980
artificial intelligence.

13:55.020 --> 13:55.980
Polar ice caps melting.

13:56.020 --> 13:57.324
The next outbreak

13:57.364 --> 13:57.926
of fish measles could

13:57.966 --> 13:58.980
wipe us out entirely.

13:59.020 --> 13:59.980
I'm sorry? Fish...

14:00.020 --> 14:00.933
My mum always says

14:00.973 --> 14:01.541
the defining feature

14:01.581 --> 14:01.980
of humanity

14:02.020 --> 14:02.980
is impatience.

14:03.020 --> 14:03.980
Even for its own destruction.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.980
Our mum always says

14:06.020 --> 14:06.980
that one cheese toastie

14:07.020 --> 14:07.980
is never enough,

14:08.020 --> 14:10.000
but two is always too much.

14:11.000 --> 14:11.980
[chuckles]

14:12.020 --> 14:13.011
You're only making

14:13.051 --> 14:13.183
fun of me because

14:13.223 --> 14:13.980
the government is hiding

14:14.020 --> 14:15.444
how bad it truly is.

14:15.484 --> 14:16.980
If you had any idea--

14:17.020 --> 14:17.448
No, no.

14:17.488 --> 14:18.980
I am on your side, bro.

14:19.020 --> 14:20.820
Don't believe their lies, man.

14:21.000 --> 14:21.548
Like, "Yeah guys.

14:21.588 --> 14:21.980
Shall we just

14:22.020 --> 14:23.336
get on a spaceship

14:23.376 --> 14:24.980
and go 'to the moon.'"

14:25.020 --> 14:26.460
As if, man. One giant leap

14:26.500 --> 14:28.120
for fucking bullshit, mate.

14:29.000 --> 14:29.980
Okay. All right.

14:30.020 --> 14:30.578
So, Kim, you said your mum

14:30.618 --> 14:31.698
told you all this?

14:32.000 --> 14:32.980
You think we're wrong then?

14:33.020 --> 14:34.980
Well, no. I'm just saying.

14:35.020 --> 14:35.348
I think even

14:35.388 --> 14:35.980
if we are all fucked,

14:36.020 --> 14:37.980
I'd rather take my chances

14:38.020 --> 14:38.548
in the real world,

14:38.588 --> 14:38.980
than hide away

14:39.020 --> 14:40.399
in the middle of nowhere

14:40.439 --> 14:40.980
in a cave.

14:41.020 --> 14:41.980
It's a hut.

14:42.020 --> 14:42.689
My mum only makes me sleep

14:42.729 --> 14:42.980
in the cave

14:43.020 --> 14:44.552
when the bald man comes

14:44.592 --> 14:46.000
to fix the generator.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.921
Yeah, that thing

14:50.961 --> 14:51.980
breaks down a lot.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.980
d

14:54.020 --> 14:55.220
What does that mean?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.015
Okay, fun thought. Let's say

15:04.055 --> 15:04.980
it is the end of the world

15:05.020 --> 15:05.861
and we all had

15:05.901 --> 15:06.271
two weeks to live.

15:06.311 --> 15:06.980
What would you do?

15:07.020 --> 15:09.091
Easy. I'd marry my girlfriend

15:09.131 --> 15:10.378
on, like, a roller coaster

15:10.418 --> 15:11.018
or summat.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.387
-[smirks]

15:12.427 --> 15:13.207
-Nice. Nicky?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.980
I would write a lot, paint,

15:16.020 --> 15:17.980
seek out the majesty of nature.

15:18.020 --> 15:18.980
Oh, really?

15:19.020 --> 15:20.550
No. I'd eat donuts and try

15:20.590 --> 15:22.030
to have sex with people.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.017
That's good, because if no one

15:24.057 --> 15:24.980
wanted to have sex with you,

15:25.020 --> 15:26.103
then you could just

15:26.143 --> 15:26.980
use the donuts.

15:27.020 --> 15:27.980
That was my thinking exactly.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.173
All right, go on, Kim,

15:29.213 --> 15:29.980
what about you?

15:30.020 --> 15:31.980
Um...

15:32.020 --> 15:32.861
Sex and donuts

15:32.901 --> 15:33.980
sounds good to me.

15:34.020 --> 15:34.662
Well, then there we are

15:34.702 --> 15:35.362
then, guys.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.800
To the end of the world, baby.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
d

15:57.000 --> 15:57.980
Me and Ellie had been

15:58.020 --> 15:59.280
together three years.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Met at Uni.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.260
You know how it goes.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.800
I guess it wasn't mutual then?

16:08.000 --> 16:08.980
It was, actually.

16:09.020 --> 16:10.460
It was a mutual decision

16:11.000 --> 16:11.558
between her and her

16:11.598 --> 16:11.980
new boyfriend.

16:12.020 --> 16:14.000
[both chuckle]

16:15.000 --> 16:15.782
-[alarm beeping]

16:15.822 --> 16:16.322
-Oh.

16:21.000 --> 16:21.507
Don't you have to take

16:21.547 --> 16:22.747
your pollution pill?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
What?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.980
You are immunized, I guess.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.011
Did your mum give you

16:29.051 --> 16:29.980
those by any chance?

16:30.020 --> 16:31.000
Yeah.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.366
I can't believe this your

16:35.406 --> 16:36.980
first trip into civilization.

16:37.020 --> 16:39.000
Like... ever.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.035
Well, I did the supply run

16:42.075 --> 16:43.000
a few times.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.750
But I guess that's just

16:45.790 --> 16:47.000
in and out so...

16:49.000 --> 16:49.412
And why did you

16:49.452 --> 16:50.652
decide to leave now?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
I haven't left.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I'm going back.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.928
Just felt like now

16:56.968 --> 16:58.168
is a good time to...

16:59.000 --> 16:59.877
cross some things

16:59.917 --> 17:01.177
off my list, I guess.

17:03.000 --> 17:03.565
You and Jay are quite

17:03.605 --> 17:04.505
different then?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.980
Our dad died when we were kids,

17:08.020 --> 17:08.843
so that sort of

17:08.883 --> 17:10.083
brought us together.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.980
I'm sorry. I feel bad now.

17:15.020 --> 17:16.040
That's all right.

17:17.000 --> 17:17.669
He had this

17:17.709 --> 17:19.000
landscaping business.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.765
And me and Jay, we've always

17:21.805 --> 17:23.000
had this plan to...

17:24.000 --> 17:24.980
resurrect it.

17:25.020 --> 17:27.000
But you don't want to?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I studied English at Uni.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.008
I've been offered this

17:32.048 --> 17:32.980
internship in London.

17:33.020 --> 17:35.000
It's gonna break his heart.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
[typing]

17:47.000 --> 17:48.500
So, how did your dad die?

17:50.000 --> 17:50.980
Heart attack.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.000
Yours?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Yeah, same.

18:27.000 --> 18:27.980
He died when I was six.

18:28.020 --> 18:29.687
That's kind of the reason

18:29.727 --> 18:30.083
why me and Mum left

18:30.123 --> 18:31.263
in the first place.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
It's funny.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.585
My dad died the exact same day

18:36.625 --> 18:38.185
my little cousin was born.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.143
We even passed my aunt

18:40.183 --> 18:41.143
in the hospital.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.255
It's like there's

18:44.295 --> 18:44.953
a finite amount of love

18:44.993 --> 18:46.253
allowed in the world.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Exactly.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.448
And you've got a pour

18:51.488 --> 18:52.144
a bit out to make room

18:52.184 --> 18:53.204
for the next bit.

19:05.000 --> 19:05.980
[Jay] Guys!

19:06.020 --> 19:06.983
Oh, my God!

19:07.023 --> 19:07.980
Come quick!

19:08.020 --> 19:09.083
Yo, yo, I'm serious. You lot

19:09.123 --> 19:10.503
need to come right now.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.827
Kim, your mum was right.

19:14.867 --> 19:15.980
It's happening.

19:16.020 --> 19:18.000
Dude, it's fucking happening.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.677
But it's okay,

19:21.717 --> 19:22.386
'cause I found some

19:22.426 --> 19:23.980
donuts in the kitchen.

19:24.020 --> 19:25.000
[chuckling]

19:28.000 --> 19:29.020
[Kim] Oh, my God!

19:31.000 --> 19:32.980
Is this happening right now?

19:33.020 --> 19:33.980
How did it start?

19:34.020 --> 19:35.486
-Kim, there isn't any--

19:35.526 --> 19:36.980
-Chlorinated chicken...

19:37.020 --> 19:40.000
and climate change.

19:41.000 --> 19:41.916
-Combined.

19:41.956 --> 19:42.991
-Okay, one of us needs

19:43.031 --> 19:43.980
to call the WHO.

19:44.020 --> 19:44.487
-The who?

19:44.527 --> 19:44.980
-Exactly.

19:45.020 --> 19:45.314
-What?

19:45.354 --> 19:46.980
-Oh, never mind, I need to go.

19:47.020 --> 19:47.406
-Hold on a second.

19:47.446 --> 19:47.980
-I just don't believe it.

19:48.020 --> 19:48.834
You spend your

19:48.874 --> 19:49.214
whole life thinking

19:49.254 --> 19:49.980
the world's gonna end

19:50.020 --> 19:50.940
in the blink of an eye

19:50.980 --> 19:51.980
and then suddenly it is.

19:52.020 --> 19:52.841
Okay, seriously, Kim,

19:52.881 --> 19:53.654
don't worry, there's nothing

19:53.694 --> 19:53.980
actually--

19:54.020 --> 19:54.961
Nicky, this is such

19:55.001 --> 19:56.201
a serious situation.

19:57.000 --> 19:57.980
There's nothing actually what?

19:58.020 --> 19:59.760
There's nothing actually to--

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
that we can do right now.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
You're right.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.071
-This isn't funny.

20:12.111 --> 20:12.980
-It fucking is!

20:13.020 --> 20:13.980
Jay!

20:14.020 --> 20:14.957
It was just a joke

20:14.997 --> 20:15.418
'cause of the whole

20:15.458 --> 20:15.980
sex, doughnuts,

20:16.020 --> 20:17.457
end of the world thing.

20:17.497 --> 20:18.103
I didn't think she would

20:18.143 --> 20:19.343
actually believe it.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
d

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Whoa.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Kim! Kim!

20:34.000 --> 20:34.980
Get in the car.

20:35.020 --> 20:35.906
Don't worry, Dad.

20:35.946 --> 20:37.146
There's enough time.

20:44.000 --> 20:44.980
[Jay] Where the hell

20:45.020 --> 20:45.980
is she going anyway?

20:46.020 --> 20:47.127
[Nicky] Just shut up

20:47.167 --> 20:48.067
and follow her.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Kim!

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Kim! Kim!

21:32.000 --> 21:32.732
I can't believe

21:32.772 --> 21:33.980
she actually fell for it.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.098
She's probably never seen

21:35.138 --> 21:35.980
the internet before.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.980
Of course, she fell for it.

21:38.020 --> 21:39.085
Why didn't she realize

21:39.125 --> 21:39.980
on the drive over?

21:40.020 --> 21:40.625
Because it's the middle

21:40.665 --> 21:40.980
of the night,

21:41.020 --> 21:42.602
even if it was true no fucker

21:42.642 --> 21:44.142
would be awake to see it.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.980
Stop worrying, man.

21:47.020 --> 21:47.603
Look, whoever she's gone

21:47.643 --> 21:48.543
in there to see

21:49.000 --> 21:49.640
will tell her that it's a joke,

21:49.680 --> 21:50.640
and that's that.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.140
What's the problem?

22:38.000 --> 22:38.944
I had the chance to say

22:38.984 --> 22:39.980
something and I didn't...

22:40.020 --> 22:40.985
She's gonna think

22:41.025 --> 22:41.980
I'm a right dick.

22:42.020 --> 22:42.980
It was just a little joke.

22:43.020 --> 22:44.049
She's gonna think

22:44.089 --> 22:44.980
it's hilarious.

22:45.020 --> 22:45.699
-Is she though?

22:45.739 --> 22:47.359
-Look, even if she doesn't,

22:48.000 --> 22:48.980
what's the worst

22:49.020 --> 22:50.000
that can happen?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.980
[whistles]

22:58.020 --> 22:59.000
d

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Trust me.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.620
Everything's gonna be fine.

23:09.000 --> 23:09.980
[sighs]

23:10.020 --> 23:11.640
Yeah, I guess you're right.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
[sighs]

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Ian!

24:22.000 --> 24:22.412
Was that you playing

24:22.452 --> 24:24.012
silly bollocks downstairs?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
