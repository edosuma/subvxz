WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:04.171
I know a lot of things
have changed around here lately,

00:04.171 --> 00:06.632
but in my opinion,
that's a sign of growth.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.717
And despite our growing pains,

00:08.717 --> 00:12.721
I like to think our student body
has never been more...

00:12.721 --> 00:14.973
united.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.476
There's,
like, nine of us here.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.646
Which means your voice carries,
Hope.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.941
But despite our spotty
assembly attendance,

00:23.941 --> 00:25.651
which I will address,

00:25.651 --> 00:29.988
we now have
30 students enrolled.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.951
Which officially...

00:35.327 --> 00:37.829
...makes us a school
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.790
And, more than that,

00:39.790 --> 00:40.874
a home!

00:40.874 --> 00:42.251
And-and more to that,

00:42.251 --> 00:44.127
uh, sense of community...

00:45.254 --> 00:46.880
...I give you Elizabeth
Saltzman.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.345
I know I'm not the only one
who misses

00:53.345 --> 00:55.430
the way things used to be
around here.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.807
That doesn't mean

00:56.807 --> 00:59.184
that our way of life
needs to change.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.270
The simple math is

01:01.270 --> 01:02.771
fewer students
equals less tuition.

01:02.771 --> 01:03.814
Which is why...

01:05.565 --> 01:08.735
...the smoothie bar

01:08.735 --> 01:10.320
has been shuttered,

01:10.320 --> 01:12.990
the pool closed,
and all of our dances

01:12.990 --> 01:15.075
and trips have been canceled.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.451
But...

01:16.451 --> 01:18.245
I have a way
to turn that all around,

01:18.245 --> 01:19.496
with your help.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.043
Our first--

01:25.043 --> 01:26.295
hopefully last--

01:26.295 --> 01:28.547
Salvatore School
Fundraiser Month.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.387
Over the next four weeks,

01:35.387 --> 01:37.222
we will be hosting
a series of events.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.433
A car wash, a bake sale.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.394
And I am well aware
that that is only two ideas,

01:42.394 --> 01:44.354
so any recommendations

01:44.354 --> 01:45.772
are welcome.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.191
That's the spirit, Cleo.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.277
Hope and I can make art
and host an auction.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.571
Um, mm, I retract that offer.

01:52.571 --> 01:53.739
Too late.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.199
Art auction
approved.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.827
Now, if some of our
more tenured students

01:58.827 --> 02:01.204
could follow your example, we'll
have this place back to normal

02:01.204 --> 02:02.289
in no time.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.373
Sorry to interrupt.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.875
I was on my way to school.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.293
You need to sign for this.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.045
What is it?
Something from Town Hall.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.764
It's a property tax lien.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.684
That we have seven days to pay?!

02:24.561 --> 02:25.520
How much?

02:27.731 --> 02:29.441
It's $91,000...

02:31.526 --> 02:33.070
...or the bank gets the school.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.615
Over my dead body.

02:36.615 --> 02:40.494
Screw Fundraiser Month.
Welcome to Fundraiser Day.

02:40.494 --> 02:44.373
We're gonna do all of it
at once, right now.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.293
What are you staring at?
Let's go.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.926
Ah.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.970
You look...

02:58.970 --> 03:00.972
Frustrated? Annoyed?

03:00.972 --> 03:03.683
Like a complete
and abject failure?

03:03.683 --> 03:06.019
I was going to say "nice,"
with your hair like that.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.562
Flattery will get you nowhere.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.897
My official stance is that
I'm mad at you

03:08.897 --> 03:10.273
for making me do this.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.067
I am not making you
do anything.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.111
We are helping the school.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.446
Well, I'm gonna have to
find some other way.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.282
I'm blocked. I've got nothing.
Come on.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.536
All art has something
beautiful in it.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.042
Oh, okay.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.460
I didn't think it was that bad.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.088
It is very technically
proficient,

03:33.088 --> 03:34.965
it just feels a little...

03:34.965 --> 03:37.342
soulless.

03:37.342 --> 03:41.096
No need to spare my feelings.
I did not think a
tribrid would be

03:41.096 --> 03:42.764
so sensitive.
Usually I'm not.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.350
But I haven't made
anything good

03:45.350 --> 03:46.852
since Landon died,

03:46.852 --> 03:49.521
and my only hope of
finding him was destroyed.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.064
I'm sorry.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.400
I have been blocked
before, too,

03:53.400 --> 03:56.486
and it also came after
a devastating loss.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.407
What did you do
to break out of it?

04:00.407 --> 04:03.994
Something drastic.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.498
The day we met,

04:08.498 --> 04:10.167
you told me you did not know
how to move on

04:10.167 --> 04:11.751
from Landon's death.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.505
I have an idea that may help.

04:15.505 --> 04:19.009
Let me guess.
It's drastic.

04:19.009 --> 04:22.137
I hate everything about this.

04:22.137 --> 04:25.056
Me, too.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.059
You know, we really gotta
up your tie game, Doc.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.520
And don't-don't get me
started on these shoes.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.357
I know why I'm suffering
like this,

04:34.357 --> 04:36.151
but why are you all dressed up?

04:36.151 --> 04:38.195
I heard you were going
to the bank. I want in.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.864
No offense,
but you're a teenager.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.533
Not exactly the ideal
candidate for a loan.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.495
Uh, a teenage vampire,
who told you I wanted you

04:46.495 --> 04:48.705
to be able to rely on me.
Remember?

04:48.705 --> 04:51.708
So I'm thinking
zero-percent interest

04:51.708 --> 04:53.668
over a thousand years.

04:53.668 --> 04:58.298
Using compulsion to get money
would be theft, and unethical.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.635
You think a bank doesn't use

05:01.635 --> 05:04.095
every power at their disposal

05:04.095 --> 05:06.097
to take more
than their fair share?

05:06.097 --> 05:08.517
Come on, Doc, we gotta fight
fire with fire.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.268
And burn everything down
in the process?

05:10.268 --> 05:11.853
If that's what it takes.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.814
This is a human problem, Kaleb.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.650
One, admittedly, I got us into
when I let things fall

05:16.650 --> 05:19.152
to the wayside
while searching for Landon,

05:19.152 --> 05:22.864
so I will solve this
in my own human way.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.449
But if you are serious

05:24.449 --> 05:27.202
about taking on more
responsibility around here...

05:27.202 --> 05:28.662
Dead serious.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.747
Supervise the fundraiser
while I'm gone.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.377
I don't want anyone using
their power around the public,

05:35.377 --> 05:37.879
or hatching supernatural
solutions to this mess, either.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.048
So you just want me
to stop everyone from doing

05:40.048 --> 05:41.800
exactly what I wanted to do.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.677
Exactly.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.012
Hey, what's up?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.389
I wasn't expecting
to hear from you.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.640
So you didn't drop
the illusion spell?

05:48.640 --> 05:51.685
Because something's wrong
with it.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.478
And if anyone finds...

05:53.478 --> 05:55.105
Which is why I can't come
to the magic mirror right now.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.065
Leave a message, unless
this is Milton Greasley.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.400
I'm over this phone tag.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.860
I'm not taking you back,
stalker.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.408
Lizzie!

06:06.408 --> 06:08.994
I am getting ready.
Can you give me a minute?

06:08.994 --> 06:10.870
Oh, I already gave you
one of those. In fact,

06:10.870 --> 06:12.163
it's actually been 34 minutes,

06:12.163 --> 06:13.582
since you missed
morning assembly.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.709
No. I'm saying no now, remember?

06:15.709 --> 06:19.754
I felt like sleeping in today,
and this is not a good time.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.423
Do I need to remind you
what you missed out on

06:21.423 --> 06:24.426
the last time that
you said no to me?

06:24.426 --> 06:28.221
Once again, no, I remember that
pretty vividly.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.432
I'll bet you do.
And unfortunately,

06:30.432 --> 06:33.685
this ask is far less exciting
than sex.

06:33.685 --> 06:37.147
And today, I am not taking no
for an answer.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.648
Then yes.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.151
Yes, yes to whatever it is.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.902
Now leave, so a man
can get dressed in peace.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.405
Speaking of...

06:47.240 --> 06:48.491
What the hell is this?

06:50.535 --> 06:53.580
Uh, your assignment
for Fundraiser Day.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.040
Don't miss assembly
next time.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.017
Dudes, do not do my baby
like that.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.561
And watch the rough side
of the sponge.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.813
Sponges don't have rough sides,
you...

07:18.813 --> 07:22.442
Good, honest friend,
who would never hook up

07:22.442 --> 07:24.527
with another man's girl.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.946
That...
Keep scrubbing.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.990
All right.
Well, this is a disaster.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.201
I know. He's gonna leave streaks
all over my car.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.994
I'm talking about
Fundraiser Day.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.746
No one is here!

07:36.706 --> 07:40.335
Uh... what you want me
to do about it, Lizzie?

07:40.335 --> 07:42.170
Two hours isn't much time
to get a whole

07:42.170 --> 07:45.715
marketing campaign
dialed in. Mmm.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.718
Okay, this isn't working.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.221
Time to bring out
the big guns.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.598
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
What's your plan?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.058
I'm gonna go and get my
grimoire.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.018
There are some old,
Salem-era spells

07:57.018 --> 07:58.895
for dispersing angry mobs.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.523
I'm gonna try and figure out
if I can reverse one of them

08:01.523 --> 08:03.191
and draw people here.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.360
No. Your dad said no magic,
and I promised him

08:05.360 --> 08:06.820
that I'd make sure of that.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.071
Okay. And since when do you
and him

08:08.071 --> 08:09.823
agree on that subject?

08:09.823 --> 08:12.325
We don't. But he's never gonna
see that he's wrong

08:12.325 --> 08:15.078
until we do it his way
and let it all burn...

08:16.663 --> 08:18.873
Knock it off, Lizzie.
I'm serious.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.711
I didn't do that.
I swear.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.799
I need to find out who did.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.678
I know you said this is
a drastic solution,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.972
but you cannot expect me
to paint

08:33.972 --> 08:36.015
with my dead boyfriend's
remains.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.269
No, I expect you to
give him life again

08:39.269 --> 08:41.312
in the only way you can now,
with your art.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.315
If that's your solution, no
thanks, I'll find another way.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.819
Is having him on your
nightstand forever the solution?

08:51.448 --> 08:54.534
No, it's not.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.661
You cannot move on from grief
if you are still

08:56.661 --> 08:58.872
holding onto it.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.129

Hey.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.844
Oh, top o' the morning to ya.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.434
Apparently, the pot of gold
in most leprechaun myths

10:43.434 --> 10:45.979
isn't literal, so it
isn't our lucky day.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.856
Yeah, well, his, either-- soon
as Hope finds out about this,

10:47.856 --> 10:49.566
she's gonna want to cut off
his lucky charms.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.153
What the hell?

10:54.153 --> 10:56.656
No! Those are mine.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.911
No, no, don't... What?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.960
You nasty.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.548
Guess now we know what he eats.
It makes sense.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.341
It says here leprechauns' powers

11:15.341 --> 11:17.343
include being
attracted to wealth

11:17.343 --> 11:20.096
and attracting wealth.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.016
Their mere presence

11:23.016 --> 11:25.602
will entice humans into
spending indiscriminately,

11:25.602 --> 11:27.562
which early supernatural-run
casinos used

11:27.562 --> 11:29.606
to great effect!

11:29.606 --> 11:31.608
Blah, blah, history, blah.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.110
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.361
That you forgot
your dad said we can't

11:35.361 --> 11:36.905
use supernatural powers?

11:36.905 --> 11:38.114
Well, that's the beauty
of the situation.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.699
We aren't.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.701
He is.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.203
Classic loophole.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.622
Yeah, and how do those generally

11:45.622 --> 11:47.540
work out for us, Lizzie?
It's different

11:47.540 --> 11:49.542
this time, okay? We have...

11:49.542 --> 11:51.252
the luck of the Irish.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.172
Plus it's a win-win-win, okay?

11:54.172 --> 11:56.591
You can prove
my dad wrong about not

11:56.591 --> 11:59.302
using powers while still
following his stupid rules.

12:00.261 --> 12:04.474
And we can save the school
in the process.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.898
Did you hear
something?

12:11.898 --> 12:14.400
Like I've been telling

12:14.400 --> 12:17.028
all of the vampires and
the werewolves at this school,

12:17.028 --> 12:18.947
I don't have
supernatural hearing

12:18.947 --> 12:21.491
'cause I'm a freaking fairy.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.701
Oh.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.412
Sorry, man. That was
a surprisingly deep resentment

12:26.412 --> 12:29.415
I've... obviously
been repressing. Why?

12:29.415 --> 12:30.375
What did you hear?

12:30.375 --> 12:32.168
Cars.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.920
Voices.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.421
Lots of them.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.006
If you build it, they will come.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.926
Okay, fire up the hose, Wade.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.511
Put the kitchen on high alert.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.638
Tell Hope and Cleo
to start cranking out that art.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.349
We're in business, baby.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.517
Welcome...

12:47.517 --> 12:49.519
wealthy, generous townspeople.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.104
All right, I have $1,000.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.315
Can I get $1,200?

12:56.234 --> 12:57.902

MG, are you okay?!

13:41.654 --> 13:43.406
Not really.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.535
I know this may be
hard to believe,

13:47.535 --> 13:49.454
but it's going even worse
than it looks.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.541
Did Lizzie put you up to this?
Yeah, man!

13:53.541 --> 13:55.752
At first, it was chill,
but then the bake sale

13:55.752 --> 13:57.545
just... turned up.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.672
People can't get
enough of my cookies.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.300
And I literally cannot
make them fast enough.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.510
Well, that's good, right?
It means we're making money.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.220
In theory, but unlike me,

14:06.220 --> 14:09.265
this oven has no vamp speed.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.435
I can't be here all day
because I have some...

14:12.435 --> 14:15.146
something to-to-to take care of.

14:15.146 --> 14:18.274
That's unnecessarily mysterious.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.444
But you won't be here all day.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.321
Because I'm gonna help you.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.949
I just need to be
at Mystic Falls High by lunch.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.453
For something.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.163
That's...

14:32.163 --> 14:34.582
also unnecessarily mysterious.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.126
You sure you want to cut class?

14:37.126 --> 14:38.586
You sure you can do
this without me?

14:39.921 --> 14:42.423
It is stunning.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.759
Now I know you were lying.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.095
You must have taken
a sculpting class.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.971
No, not before today.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.474
But I had a great teacher.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.059
I am pretty great.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.227
Mm-hmm.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.655
I'll warm up the kiln.

15:05.655 --> 15:06.864
Oh, no, that's okay.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.908
Incendia.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.126
He is beautiful.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.672
I didn't even do him justice.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.632
"Luctus."

15:24.632 --> 15:26.259
What does it mean?

15:28.302 --> 15:31.764
That it's time to let him go.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.685
I'll take it.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.771
He looks absolutely delicious.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.606
How did you get in here?
Who is he?

15:40.606 --> 15:42.108
Someone I miss...

15:42.108 --> 15:43.985
very much.
He'll be right in my foyer

15:43.985 --> 15:46.487
if you ever want to come
and visit. How much?

15:47.238 --> 15:50.366
It's not for sale.
This is happening really fast.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.535
Everything has its price.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.704
It is $91,000.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.747
Done.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.916
This money will save the
school, Hope.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.418
This is good.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.003
This is letting go.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.462
Sorry. I can't.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.839
I won't take no
for an answer.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.257
I simply have to have it.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.758
No, what you have
to do is leave.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.094
Uh...

16:20.980 --> 16:23.232
We're gonna get this bill
paid off in no time.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.484
Why stop there?
There are so many

16:25.484 --> 16:27.778
things at this school that need
to go back to the way they were.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.071
Like what, exactly?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.907
The smoothie bar.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.034
That student spa
we've always dreamed of.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.369
Okay, I've always dreamed of.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.704
But we're on a hot streak, okay?

16:36.704 --> 16:38.623
There is no way
I'm pulling the plug

16:38.623 --> 16:40.249
until we fix everything.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.793
Okay, I will
unless you tell Hope--

16:42.793 --> 16:44.921
Tell me what?

16:45.671 --> 16:48.341
Just that another
Lizzie Saltzman-planned event

16:48.341 --> 16:51.677
has blossomed
into a smashing success.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.471
Speaking of smashing, um,
some woman just tried

16:53.471 --> 16:55.556
to shank me for not
selling her my art.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.351
That sounds
like a tough negotiation.

16:58.351 --> 17:02.104
Not really. She was willing
to give us the $91,000.

17:04.065 --> 17:07.818
Wow, I had no idea
that Hope was so talented.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.946
I'm sure it was
an isolated incident.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.698
So... back to making art.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.409
You're not pissed at me for
turning down that much money?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.870
Now you must be
up to something.

17:19.914 --> 17:23.125
Hey, what's wrong with you?!
Those snickerdoodles are mine!

17:26.504 --> 17:29.882
Two... isolated incidents.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.388
Get ready for a third unless
you tell me what's going on.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.060
Is that what I think it is?

17:42.561 --> 17:45.147
Yep. It's a leprechaun,
all right.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.649
Don't worry, he's harmless.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.109
Though he does make people
act a little wacky.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.027
That's not what I mean--
it's a monster.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.779
A Malivore monster.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.365
Yeah, that's making us rich.
So what's the problem?

17:54.365 --> 17:56.158
The problem is that it's here,
which means a portal

17:56.158 --> 17:57.994
to the prison world
must be open.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.998
Oh, yeah, that.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.174
How could you? How could
you keep a Malivore monster

18:12.174 --> 18:14.093
a secret from me?
I'm sorry.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.803
Did I miss that wee-little
badge he's wearing

18:15.803 --> 18:17.555
that says,
"Hi, Malivore sent me"?

18:17.555 --> 18:19.223
I'm serious, Lizzie.
So am I, Hope!

18:19.223 --> 18:21.559
Our school is in trouble.

18:21.559 --> 18:22.977
So forgive me

18:22.977 --> 18:24.312
for prioritizing that

18:24.312 --> 18:26.606
over your emotional needs
for once.

18:26.606 --> 18:30.359
My emotional needs?!

18:32.445 --> 18:35.364
So you regretting
enrolling here yet?

18:35.364 --> 18:38.451
That depends-- what exactly
should I know about Malivore?

18:38.451 --> 18:41.245
Short version--
he's a super old mud dude

18:41.245 --> 18:42.747
who ate a bunch of monsters
back in the day,

18:42.747 --> 18:44.290
and keeps them
trapped inside of him

18:44.290 --> 18:45.625
like it's another dimension.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.585
But we...

18:47.585 --> 18:49.086
we took care of it,
it's cool now.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.755
He's locked in a prison world.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.382
What exactly should I know
about prison worlds?

18:53.382 --> 18:56.635
Well, you know
how prisons are messed up...

18:56.635 --> 18:58.471
What happened?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.848
They stopped screaming.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.933
We like that, right?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.395
Hope, wait!
No.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.773
Hey, hey, hey, I know we've
all thought about it,

19:08.773 --> 19:11.233
but don't kill Lizzie.
You're jumping
to conclusions.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.319
Okay, what if he was
just some random monster

19:13.319 --> 19:15.529
who happened to walk by
right when we needed him?

19:15.529 --> 19:17.490
When have we ever been
that lucky?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.492
That's not a pun.
Okay.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.868
Ladies, the leprechaun's making

19:20.868 --> 19:22.828
everyone a little wacky.
How about we all

19:22.828 --> 19:24.163
just take a second to breathe?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.457
Not now, Kaleb!

19:26.457 --> 19:28.376
Okay, I'll leave.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.044
But not until you tell me
that plan for that axe.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.505
My plan is what yours
should've been all along.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.757
To get answers out of that thing
and then kill it.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.884
So I suggest that you two
shut down Fundraiser Day,

19:36.884 --> 19:38.969
unless you want to tell
all those people out there

19:38.969 --> 19:41.222
that that's
a leprechaun screaming.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.475
Any objections?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.146
Then that's the only good
decision that you've made

19:49.146 --> 19:50.815
all day.

19:55.945 --> 19:59.490
So what are we doing here
exactly?

20:02.243 --> 20:04.620
Um, maybe if you told me
what we were looking for,

20:04.620 --> 20:06.205
we could pick up
the pace a little.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.665
I'm moving as fast as I can.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.708
Yeah, cool,
it's just that, you know,

20:09.708 --> 20:12.920
I have this thing and I'm
pretty sure you had a thing,

20:12.920 --> 20:16.882
which remains unnecessarily
mysterious to me.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.803
I have a study date at lunch
with my new lab partner, Finch.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.973
Oh, that's why
you're all dressed up.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.017
I'm sure it's not as big
a deal as I'm making it.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.395
There's Herba fermentum
here somewhere.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.105
And it's a leavening accelerant.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.648
Which, if you put it
in your dough,

20:32.648 --> 20:34.191
it'll bake in half the time.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.651
That sounds perfect.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.736
You wouldn't happen
to know of a weed

20:37.736 --> 20:41.323
that would help with,
I don't know... illusion spells?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.242
Mm, not off the top
of my head. Why?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.785
Bingo!

20:44.785 --> 20:47.121
I think this is it.
Maybe it's this one.

20:47.121 --> 20:50.958
They both look the same to me.
My Botanical Arcanum's rusty,
but I know

20:50.958 --> 20:53.377
the one that we want tastes like
cinnamon and the lower school

20:53.377 --> 20:55.337
has access to this part
of the garden, which means

20:55.337 --> 20:57.506
nothing's dangerous,
so... pick one.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.260
This one.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.681
It doesn't taste
like cinnamon.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.060
If anything, it's... minty.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.772
And honestly,

21:13.772 --> 21:15.608
there's no need to rush.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.276
My study date isn't
a real date, right?

21:17.276 --> 21:18.903
Because I am not ready
for that.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.279
Okay. This-- this took a turn.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.697
And I don't know why

21:21.697 --> 21:22.948
Lizzie put you
in charge of baking

21:22.948 --> 21:24.241
when you're not any good at it.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.659
MG...

21:25.659 --> 21:27.203
I am so sorry.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.329
It's okay.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.331
I think that's the weed talking.

21:30.331 --> 21:31.874
Blue Calamus.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.251
Truth weed.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.879
Ooh. Yeah.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.717
Alaric Saltzman?

21:41.717 --> 21:43.469
Vera Lilien.

21:45.429 --> 21:48.015
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.267
Lilien...
That name sounds so familiar.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.231
Oh, you're Dana's mom.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.398
Mm-hmm.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.276
I am so sorry for your tragic

21:59.276 --> 22:01.153
and unexpected loss.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.239
You know,
I've always said that

22:03.239 --> 22:07.034
mountain lions are
a real problem around here.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.536
And you are
Lizzie's father.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.955
Hmm. Well,
it appears the rotten apple

22:10.955 --> 22:14.875
falls farther from the tall,
virile tree than I thought.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.296
Don't you and your husband work
at the pharmacy?

22:19.296 --> 22:21.215
Dana's death was quite the blow.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.759
Her father and I split recently.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.178
Mm-hmm. Come with me.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.765
Help!

22:34.311 --> 22:35.938
What the hell, Wade?

22:35.938 --> 22:37.982
The townies have
lost their minds

22:37.982 --> 22:39.984
and there's not enough
Wade to go around.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.361
Can you use your vamp strength
and help a brother out, please?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.574
Okay, I got this.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.325
You go get a shower

22:48.325 --> 22:49.785
and find a
new shirt.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.245
Fundraiser Day is cancelled.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.457
Hey! Quit pounding.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.209
I'm coming out.
Wait!

22:57.209 --> 22:59.169
Before you compel
everyone to leave,

22:59.169 --> 23:00.421
I want to sell
some of my old stuff.

23:00.421 --> 23:01.589
For crazy prices?

23:01.589 --> 23:03.382
Whatever the market will bear.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.967
Hope's right, Lizzie.
We-we gotta stop this.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.969
Look, we already have
the money we need.

23:06.969 --> 23:10.014
For the last time--
smoothie bar!

23:10.014 --> 23:12.433
You're acting as
crazy as the townies.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.351
What is the point

23:14.351 --> 23:15.936
of trying to save our home

23:15.936 --> 23:17.646
if it doesn't even feel
like home anymore?

23:17.646 --> 23:18.772
Oh, that's right.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.399
I'm asking
the wrong person,

23:20.399 --> 23:23.360
because you just want
to watch it all burn.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.070
Lizzie, when I say that,
I don't mean

23:25.070 --> 23:27.031
I want to see this place go up
in literal flames.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.574
It means taking a
chance to start over

23:28.574 --> 23:30.909
and make this place
even better than it was.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.376
Open the door, Kaleb.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.836
Did you not hear
what I just said?

23:40.836 --> 23:42.046
Every word.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.715
This was my idea...

23:44.715 --> 23:47.176
so it's my responsibility
to shut it down.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.768
Oh, my God,
you are torturing it.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.227
Relax. It's not what it seems.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.480
Maybe not to you.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.190
I suppose everyone
around here thinks

24:01.190 --> 24:03.108
killing monsters is
normal. But to me,

24:03.108 --> 24:06.070
every creature-- supernatural,
human or otherwise--

24:06.070 --> 24:08.364
deserves to be treated
with respect.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.369
See? He's fine.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.454
Like I'm trying to tell you,
I'm not torturing him.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.040
I will believe you
when you drop the axe.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.211
My translation spells
are not working on him,

24:22.211 --> 24:23.837
so if we're lucky,
he will lead me

24:23.837 --> 24:25.339
straight to whatever portal
he came out of.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.969
What are you doing?

24:30.969 --> 24:31.929
Letting him go.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.015
Fly free, little butterfly.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.820
None of this
would be necessary

24:47.820 --> 24:50.322
if Alyssa Chang hadn't
broken the ascendant.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.282
If my time at the Salvatore
School has taught me anything...

24:52.282 --> 24:55.994
when in doubt,
do a locator spell.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.122
Sequitur.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.082
How do you know

25:00.082 --> 25:01.875
the leprechaun will lead
us back to the portal?

25:01.875 --> 25:04.294
Because that's the way
it's always been.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.879
After he gets
what he wants.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.881
Wait.
He wants something?

25:07.881 --> 25:09.925
Malivore monsters
always want something.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.593
If he can reach our world
as a monster,

25:11.593 --> 25:13.429
then I imagine I can
reach his the same way.

25:13.429 --> 25:16.682
Why would you want to do
something so drastic?

25:18.058 --> 25:21.145
Landon.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.689
I knew when
I couldn't sell his bust

25:23.689 --> 25:25.190
that I'm not ready
to let him go.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.025
I can't rule out
that he's not in Malivore,

25:27.025 --> 25:28.652
not without going there first.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.362
And I can only do that
through the prison world,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.281
with this thing called
an ascendant, which

25:32.281 --> 25:33.741
got destroyed.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.117
But if I can just
find the portal...

25:35.117 --> 25:37.786
Hope, I understand
you are grieving,

25:37.786 --> 25:40.622
but why would Landon be
in Malivore? He's not a monster.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.666
Well, he's a Phoenix.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.585
Was a Phoenix.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.546
And I might have neglected to
mention that Malivore's his dad.

25:50.924 --> 25:54.011
I know that this is all
really overwhelming.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.181
You don't have to help
if you don't want to.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.643
What are friends for?

26:04.313 --> 26:05.939
Lizzie and Kaleb said

26:05.939 --> 26:07.608
leprechauns are attracted
to wealth, right?

26:12.321 --> 26:13.822
This is a lot of money.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.200
Not many people would
be willing to assume

26:16.200 --> 26:19.036
so much personal debt in order
to save a failing business.

26:19.036 --> 26:21.121
It's more than a business--
it's our school.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.500
Our home. So I'm willing
to take the risk.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.877
I'm not.
Your application is denied.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.587
Why?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.255
Because of some old grudge
between our daughters?

26:30.255 --> 26:32.966
The simple fact is,
you don't qualify.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.010
And to be perfectly
honest, your desperation

26:35.010 --> 26:37.554
and sincerity
have significantly dampened

26:37.554 --> 26:39.139
any joy I expected to feel.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.516
Ms. Lilien,

26:40.516 --> 26:41.975
there has to be something
I can do.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.857
I suppose

26:48.857 --> 26:52.236
I could accept a...

26:52.236 --> 26:55.239
unique form of collateral.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.534
So long as it's substantial.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.119
Are you propositioning me?

27:01.119 --> 27:02.955
No. I'm just giving
us both what we need.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.165
It's been a little lonely
since my marriage ended.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.210
Just think of the
children, Dr. Saltzman.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.258
We should, um...
we should get going.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.927
I thought we both
had places to be.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.178
There's no point.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.972
I'm already late,

27:19.972 --> 27:22.266
and even entertaining
the thought

27:22.266 --> 27:25.102
of dating Finch is just...
it's a bad idea.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.979
Why would you say that?

27:26.979 --> 27:29.481
I mean, besides being hopped up
off truth weed.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.608
Because the people I love
always leave.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.110
Or hurt me.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.571
Or both.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.489
All right.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.908
Maybe this is bad advice,

27:39.908 --> 27:41.326
coming from someone
who's just been

27:41.326 --> 27:43.245
dumped and cheated on,

27:43.245 --> 27:46.164
but you can't let that stop you.

27:47.541 --> 27:51.712
Believe me, I don't want to.

27:51.712 --> 27:55.507
'Cause repressing things has
taken me to a super dark place.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.387
I'm scared.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.931
And I totally
understand that.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.517
But you can't let fear

28:05.517 --> 28:08.437
stop you from being honest
with the people you care about.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.899
Damn.

28:13.317 --> 28:15.235
I gotta go.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.528
Why? Where?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.155
To take my own advice.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.532
Maybe because of a contact high.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.492
Thanks, Jo.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.661
Now get to that study
date or whatever.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.292
I don't understand

28:30.292 --> 28:33.128
why getting to this point
has been so hard.

28:34.254 --> 28:37.507
Here, let me help
you with that tie.

28:37.507 --> 28:41.261
NO. Your application has also
been denied, Ms. Lilien.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.304
Call me Vera.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.555
Vera.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.140
I got my students
into this mess,

28:45.140 --> 28:46.600
and I wanted to show them
that I could fix things

28:46.600 --> 28:48.560
the right way,
and this is not the right way.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.062
Ms. Lilien.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.563
An armored truck's been stolen.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.856
And I don't know if
I'm seeing things,

28:52.856 --> 28:53.899
but it looked like...

28:53.899 --> 28:55.400
a leprechaun.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.628
He's in here, but...
Why a parking garage?

29:14.628 --> 29:17.422
The leprechaun's attracted
to wealth, so...

29:17.422 --> 29:19.466
there may be
a Lamborghini in here.

29:19.466 --> 29:22.219
Should we split up?

29:22.219 --> 29:24.554
Or is that against
monster-hunting rules?

29:24.554 --> 29:26.515
No, it's actually
a great idea.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.058
You're a monster
hunter now?

29:28.058 --> 29:29.518
Were you a sculptor
before this morning?

29:29.518 --> 29:30.894
Point taken.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.855
Okay.
We'll split up, but

29:33.855 --> 29:35.607
we need him alive
to bring us to the portal.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.277
So if you run into
any trouble, just... scream.

29:51.248 --> 29:53.250
You know, if you're
gonna cut class,

29:53.250 --> 29:56.211
coming to school kind of
defeats the whole point.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.463
Have you seen Finch?
Everybody did.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.090
She stormed out
of the cafeteria earlier.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.174
She seemed really upset.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.010
That's my fault.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.761
I need to see her.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.555
I want to see her.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.973
There's something I really
need to talk to her about.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.433
She works at The Grill
most nights.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.476
I used to drop Maya
off there sometimes.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.022
I'll give you a ride.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.399
But, like I used
to tell my sister--

30:17.399 --> 30:19.026
be careful with Finch.

30:19.026 --> 30:21.278
There's something
different about that one.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.155
Thank you, Ethan.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.991
But I don't intend
to be careful at all.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.203
I said I didn't want
to hear from you.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.622
I know.
But this is an emergency.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.000
Okay. Your persistence
has worn me down

30:35.000 --> 30:37.461
and after giving it
a lot of thought...

30:37.461 --> 30:39.212
Yes.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.048
I'll totally take you back.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.382
Yes!

30:42.382 --> 30:43.800
Wait, I don't
even want that.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.135
You cheated on me.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.095
And you don't even
go here anymore.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.346
Then why are you wasting
my time?

30:49.222 --> 30:50.432
Look at this place.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.142
Mm.

30:52.142 --> 30:55.187
Are you missing your little
imaginary action figure?

30:55.187 --> 30:57.439
Too bad.
I don't do favors for exes,

30:57.439 --> 30:58.982
so I dropped that illusion spell
like it was hot.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.984
Fine,

31:00.984 --> 31:02.444
but did you have to make

31:02.444 --> 31:04.529
the thing inside
the box disappear?

31:04.529 --> 31:05.947
I didn't,

31:05.947 --> 31:07.657
but I totally should have.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.161
I didn't want you back, either.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.539
Goodbye forever,
Milton Greasley.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.167
Did you see it?

31:17.167 --> 31:18.585
See what?

31:18.585 --> 31:20.087
The leprechaun
Kaleb and I caught.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.797
That Hope, for some
reason, set free.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.633
That proceeded to eat all
of the money we made today

31:24.633 --> 31:26.093
and ransacked the entire school,

31:26.093 --> 31:27.677
devouring expensive

31:27.677 --> 31:29.262
and occasionally
supernatural artifacts.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.639
Did you see it?

31:30.639 --> 31:32.557
No.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.521
You... and that word!

32:04.422 --> 32:07.217
Little green man,

32:07.217 --> 32:09.136
it is just you and me.

32:12.389 --> 32:15.600
I will not hurt you.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.450
Oh, Headmaster Saltzman.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.244
You scared me.
Sorry, Cleo.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.621
What are you doing here?
Are you with Hope?

32:36.621 --> 32:39.416
We split up.
It is a long story,

32:39.416 --> 32:42.627
and probably one that will make
you angry, from what I gather.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.464
But we were looking for...
A leprechaun.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.134
How did you know?
Security guard
at the bank saw it,

32:49.134 --> 32:50.969
along with something else
he probably wished he hadn't.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.405
Above you!

33:12.908 --> 33:14.242
Get it off me!

33:24.961 --> 33:26.463
Fo yato si.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.008
Cleo, no!

33:30.008 --> 33:33.136
Take cover.
He's gonna blow.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.743
You girls all right?

34:28.108 --> 34:30.277
Sorry I missed you earlier.

34:31.278 --> 34:33.530
Hmm, have we met?

34:33.530 --> 34:35.740
'Cause you remind me
of this girl I was supposed

34:35.740 --> 34:37.117
to study with over lunch...

34:37.117 --> 34:38.910
who should have just told me
she wasn't interested.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.204
But I am interested.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.623
I wanted to see you so bad
it freaked me out.

34:43.623 --> 34:46.751
And then I got mixed up
in this weed.
Wait.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.545
Are you seriously high
right now?

34:48.545 --> 34:51.881
Soaring. But it's not
what you think.
Cool.

34:51.881 --> 34:53.717
Because I don't touch the stuff.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.429
Why are you here, Jo?

34:57.429 --> 35:00.849
I want to get to
know you better,

35:00.849 --> 35:02.726
but I have no idea how.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.437
And I have
all of this baggage,

35:05.437 --> 35:07.731
and I just don't want to
mess it up.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.859
Well, standing me up
is definitely

35:10.859 --> 35:12.235
a weird way to show that.

35:12.235 --> 35:16.197
Even if it was
just a study date.

35:16.197 --> 35:20.618
But it wasn't just
a study date, right?

35:20.618 --> 35:24.706
So let's go on a real date...

35:24.706 --> 35:27.959
if you can give me
another chance.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.296
♪ I wasn't looking
for another ♪

35:32.547 --> 35:35.842
♪ But I can't ♪

35:35.842 --> 35:40.680

35:40.680 --> 35:42.223

35:42.223 --> 35:44.476

35:44.476 --> 35:48.438
♪ Why don't you love me back? ♪

35:48.438 --> 35:51.274
♪ Why'd your temptation... ♪

35:51.274 --> 35:54.569
But I'm sure we can find a time
while I drive you home.

35:56.905 --> 36:01.534
♪ You thought you could
fill the gaps ♪

36:01.534 --> 36:04.579

36:28.770 --> 36:30.563
So how did your day go?

36:30.563 --> 36:33.233
A leprechaun tried strangling me
with that thing,

36:33.233 --> 36:35.276
so, you know, the usual.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.071
Yeah, about that...

36:38.071 --> 36:40.657
So I'm assuming Lizzie already
told you everything?

36:40.657 --> 36:42.325
Yes. That you had nothing
to do with it,

36:42.325 --> 36:45.120
and you tried to do
everything that I asked.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.539
Huh.

36:47.539 --> 36:51.543
That's unexpected,
and not necessarily true.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.212
She came up with the plan,
but I went along with it.

36:54.212 --> 36:58.049
Let my ego get in the way
of what was best for the school,

36:58.049 --> 37:00.927
and now we're still deep
in the red because of it.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.097
But that loan came through,
right?

37:04.097 --> 37:05.807
I wish I could
tell you differently,

37:05.807 --> 37:07.559
but all I got from the bank
was a harsh reminder

37:07.559 --> 37:10.270
that the human world
is just as corrupt and flawed

37:10.270 --> 37:13.690
as the supernatural one,
and proof that, uh,

37:13.690 --> 37:16.401
I still got it.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.737
Whatever "it" is.

37:21.156 --> 37:23.700
Okay.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.704
So what are we gonna do
about the school, Doctor S?

37:29.747 --> 37:33.293
Fortunately, turns out
that leprechaun

37:33.293 --> 37:36.504
had a pot of gold after all.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.632
Or should I say
a potbelly o' gold?

37:39.632 --> 37:42.927
I believe these...

37:42.927 --> 37:44.721
are yours.

37:44.721 --> 37:46.222
After we pay back the townies,

37:46.222 --> 37:47.807
we still have plenty to spare.

37:49.350 --> 37:52.770
I guess it is true,
money cannot buy happiness,

37:52.770 --> 37:55.857
because you are clearly
still mad at me.

37:55.857 --> 37:58.693
I told you I wanted
the leprechaun alive.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.945
And the last thing I wanted
to do was kill him.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.948
But it was going to hurt
Dr. Saltzman, and I panicked.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.910
I didn't know he was
going to explode like that.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.162
I understand.
Saving someone is

38:09.162 --> 38:11.623
more important than
anything else.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.586
That was meant to help you.

38:16.586 --> 38:18.505
But it is not good enough
because your obsession

38:18.505 --> 38:20.715
with Landon is
all-consuming.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.885
You do not have room in your
life for anything else.

38:23.885 --> 38:25.637
In the few days I have known
you, you have not asked me

38:25.637 --> 38:28.056
a single thing about my life.

38:28.056 --> 38:31.810
You're right.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.021
I'm sorry.

38:35.021 --> 38:37.774
Earlier you mentioned
that you had been blocked.

38:37.774 --> 38:40.151
What happened?

38:40.151 --> 38:42.070
Something terrible.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.656
It is why I hate violence.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.369
My sisters were murdered.

38:49.369 --> 38:51.871
I am the only one
of us left.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.332
That's awful, Cleo.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.292
I have accepted that
there was nothing

38:56.292 --> 38:57.919
I could do to save them.

38:57.919 --> 39:02.257
I have figured out how
to live without them,

39:02.257 --> 39:05.134
to move on.
Let me guess.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.594
Now it's my turn?

39:06.594 --> 39:08.471
I thought that is
what you wanted.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.223
That was before I knew
that there was a portal;

39:10.223 --> 39:12.308
a way that I might be able
to reach Landon.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.310
I'm not gonna stop until
I've exhausted

39:14.310 --> 39:16.479
every possibility.

39:16.479 --> 39:20.024
So you can take that bust away.
I'm gonna find the real him.

39:22.110 --> 39:25.655
I see now that this will
not end until you do.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.758
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.261
And stop doing that.
This is my mess.

39:48.261 --> 39:50.888
It's okay.
There's no "I" in mess.

39:50.888 --> 39:55.101
And ignoring the fact that
there is an "M" and an "E,"

39:55.101 --> 39:56.436
I should help.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.771
Did Josie give you
one of them

39:58.771 --> 40:00.565
weird herbs from the garden?

40:00.565 --> 40:02.650
No.

40:02.650 --> 40:07.030
Relying on the comforts
of the past is a crutch.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.781
I don't need drugs...

40:08.781 --> 40:11.326
or smoothies.

40:12.493 --> 40:16.748
Well, while we are out
of our comfort zone,

40:16.748 --> 40:18.875
maybe you could help me with
this whole other mess

40:18.875 --> 40:20.543
that I came to talk
to you about.

40:21.878 --> 40:24.130
But it's a big one.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.174
Hit me with it.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.926
Just promise me...

40:29.928 --> 40:33.514
Just promise that you won't
think less of me

40:33.514 --> 40:34.932
after I tell you.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.143
That would be pretty
hypocritical.

40:37.143 --> 40:40.021
You've seen me at my worst,
and always only ever

40:40.021 --> 40:43.983
thought the best of me, even
when I didn't deserve it.

40:43.983 --> 40:47.153
Let me return the favor.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.198
It's about the ascendant.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.158
The one that your
backstabbing ex destroyed.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.203
Sorry.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.205
Leaving her in the past.

40:57.205 --> 40:59.082
Continue.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.252
What if I--

41:03.252 --> 41:07.298
What if I told you...

41:07.298 --> 41:12.220
that I actually had
the ascendant

41:12.220 --> 41:14.806
this whole time?

41:16.391 --> 41:20.061
That-that I've been
lying about it?

41:23.231 --> 41:27.735
I'd say that...

41:27.735 --> 41:31.739
I would have done
anything to help you.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.032
Seriously.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.576
But it's too late.

41:35.576 --> 41:37.286
Why?

41:46.713 --> 41:48.715
How could you?
