WEBVTT

00:06.152 --> 00:07.953
Uhm... what's happening right now?

00:08.042 --> 00:10.555
Max, are you smoking crack?

00:10.742 --> 00:13.855
It's not crack. It's lipstick.
I can't afford crack.

00:15.002 --> 00:16.753
I'm at the end of my good
lipstick and I can't afford

00:16.755 --> 00:19.389
to buy a new one
so I'm going all <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

00:19.391 --> 00:20.840
<i>"Breaking Bad"?</i>

00:20.842 --> 00:22.759
We're more like broke and sad.

00:22.761 --> 00:25.395
You're freebasing
lipstick and look,

00:25.397 --> 00:27.547
this heel is starting to wobble.

00:27.549 --> 00:30.066
Here, stick this in
and hold it.

00:30.068 --> 00:31.518
I swear I've said that before,

00:31.520 --> 00:34.137
but I don't think
it was about shoes.

00:35.172 --> 00:37.223
Yo, dollface.
It's been ten minutes!

00:37.225 --> 00:40.393
His chowder, my spaghetti.
Where's the food?

00:40.395 --> 00:41.544
"Where's the food"?

00:41.546 --> 00:44.230
Where's your neck?

00:44.232 --> 00:47.734
I wasn't listening.
I was looking at your boobs.

00:47.736 --> 00:49.252
Well, I do what I can
but they'll never be

00:49.254 --> 00:51.788
as big as yours.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.573
Pick up.
Meatball.

00:54.075 --> 00:57.544
Hey, hot stuff.
Where's the hot stuff?

00:57.546 --> 00:58.828
Oh, Max.
You were right.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.296
This heel is
much more--no.

01:00.298 --> 01:01.431
No, wait!
No, it's not.

01:01.433 --> 01:02.849
It's gonna--

01:04.552 --> 01:06.553
Those are the biggest balls
those guys have had

01:06.555 --> 01:09.272
in their laps since
they started steroids.

01:17.692 --> 01:23.292

<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:27.261 --> 01:29.945
I can't believe you masking
taped the shoe to your leg.

01:30.547 --> 01:33.465
I know but these are
Christian Louboutins and

01:33.467 --> 01:35.416
even all busted up like
this they still have

01:35.418 --> 01:37.469
the classic red bottoms.

01:37.471 --> 01:38.854
You know what else
has red bottoms?

01:38.856 --> 01:40.021
Baboons.

01:40.023 --> 01:41.857
Walk around with a couple
of them on your feet

01:41.859 --> 01:44.559
and I'm impressed.

01:44.561 --> 01:46.244
Well, at least now you can't
see those stupid bows.

01:46.246 --> 01:48.647
Who put bows on their shoes?
What's the gift?

01:48.649 --> 01:50.448
Your stinky feet?

01:50.450 --> 01:52.033
You don't think
I hate the bows?

01:52.035 --> 01:54.269
I bought these as an impulse
purchase over a year ago.

01:54.271 --> 01:55.937
I didn't know I'd be shackled
with them for eternity.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.580 --> 02:06.331
Oh, Caroline.

02:06.333 --> 02:09.050
I never noticed
you had a club foot.

02:09.051 --> 02:12.721
I would have set you up
with my brother.

02:12.723 --> 02:14.839
I broke my shoe in the diner.

02:14.841 --> 02:15.924
Oh, I can help.

02:15.926 --> 02:19.644
I always carry
my gym shoes in my bag.

02:19.646 --> 02:21.313
I'm sorry they're
so conservative

02:21.315 --> 02:23.965
but the weight room
is a real meat rack.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.483
Sophie, that's
so sweet of you.

02:25.485 --> 02:28.136
But I still have one pair
of my own shoes to wear.

02:28.138 --> 02:29.905
Oh, well take
them just in case.

02:29.907 --> 02:31.022
You should take them.

02:31.024 --> 02:33.608
You'll make $20
just walking to work.

02:33.610 --> 02:36.111
And some of your mail
got mixed in with mine.

02:36.113 --> 02:38.146
This is like the third time
that mail lady did that.

02:38.148 --> 02:41.232
All right.
Nighty night.

02:42.902 --> 02:45.937
Max, you will not believe
what just came addressed to you.

02:45.939 --> 02:47.956
Let me explain.
I'm not a scientologist.

02:47.958 --> 02:49.591
I just went that one time
because I heard

02:49.593 --> 02:51.676
some rich guy was
looking for a wife.

02:51.678 --> 02:54.879
No, we've been pre-approved
for a credit card.

02:54.881 --> 02:55.931
What?

02:55.933 --> 02:57.265
How the hell did
we get pre-approved?

02:57.267 --> 02:59.467
It says all we have to do
is go online and apply

02:59.469 --> 03:03.088
and we can be approved
in under two minutes.

03:03.090 --> 03:06.558
Slow down, Quasimodo.
I can't have a credit card.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.843
Someone gave me a bag of
Chips Ahoy! cookies once

03:08.845 --> 03:11.229
and I ate the entire thing
without breathing.

03:11.231 --> 03:12.480
Well, you're not
a child any more.

03:12.482 --> 03:14.149
You have more discipline.

03:14.151 --> 03:17.569
The cookies were yesterday.

03:17.571 --> 03:20.071
Okay, what is that thing?
What is that spinning wheel?

03:20.073 --> 03:22.073
It's just processing
our application.

03:22.075 --> 03:23.241
No, it's not.

03:23.243 --> 03:24.909
It's finding out
everything about us.

03:24.911 --> 03:27.629
Now it's finding out your dad
stole millions of dollars.

03:27.631 --> 03:30.582
Now it's finding out I got fired
from eight Dairy Queens.

03:30.584 --> 03:34.636
Now it's finding out why I got
fired from eight Dairy Queens.

03:34.638 --> 03:36.388
Oh, my God.
Max, we're approved.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.839
We've just been approved.

03:37.841 --> 03:41.593
What? What is wrong with them?
Does Dairy Queen report nothing?

03:41.595 --> 03:43.711
Get back on there
and disapprove us.

03:43.713 --> 03:45.213
Okay.
Calm down.

03:45.215 --> 03:46.998
We need this card
for our business.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.850
All we have to do is
communicate with each other

03:48.852 --> 03:50.018
about every purchase,
you know?

03:50.020 --> 03:51.770
Keep an open dialogue.

03:51.772 --> 03:55.223
So, opening dialogue.
For our business,

03:55.225 --> 03:57.075
I would like
a pair of Louboutins.

03:57.077 --> 03:59.894
Opening dialogue.
No.

03:59.896 --> 04:03.248
And I felt stupid miming that.
I hate the arts.

04:03.250 --> 04:06.034
Look, you can't get
everything you want.

04:06.036 --> 04:08.119
I would like a box of lizards.

04:08.121 --> 04:10.038
Love lizards, always have,

04:10.040 --> 04:12.090
but you don't see me
putting that on a credit card.

04:12.092 --> 04:14.409
I need a new pair of shoes
for business meetings.

04:14.411 --> 04:15.627
You know what they say,

04:15.629 --> 04:18.012
"dress for the job you want,
not the job you have".

04:18.015 --> 04:19.747
Okay, fine.

04:19.749 --> 04:21.800
If you're getting the shoes,
then I'm getting what I want.

04:21.802 --> 04:23.418
I hope you're happy
with an apartment

04:23.420 --> 04:25.136
full of lizards and lipstick.

04:25.138 --> 04:29.090
Also, some of those lizards
will be wearing lipstick.

04:32.311 --> 04:34.979
Earl, you are looking
particularly gorgeous

04:34.981 --> 04:36.281
this evening.

04:36.283 --> 04:38.233
Well, I would say,
"don't flatter me"

04:38.235 --> 04:39.734
but let's face it.

04:39.736 --> 04:42.320
Everything came
together tonight.

04:42.322 --> 04:45.073
Is it another woman?
Should I be filled with anger?

04:45.075 --> 04:47.208
I mean,
more than I usually am?

04:47.210 --> 04:50.095
I just want to look nice
for my son when he comes in.

04:50.097 --> 04:52.664
What? No way,
I'm going to meet your kid?

04:52.666 --> 04:55.283
Well, one of them.

04:55.285 --> 04:57.085
"One of them"?
How many do you have?

04:57.087 --> 04:59.888
So far?

04:59.890 --> 05:01.556
Oh, Earl, I love you.

05:01.558 --> 05:02.724
This is my son, Darius.

05:02.726 --> 05:04.759
He's the number one
Chrysler salesman

05:04.761 --> 05:07.846
in all of Detroit,
and he's my very favorite,

05:07.848 --> 05:11.516
if he's the one
I'm thinking of.

05:11.518 --> 05:14.919
Excuse me,
but aren't you Max

05:14.921 --> 05:18.323
of Max's Homemade Cupcakes?

05:18.325 --> 05:19.441
Earl, look.

05:19.443 --> 05:20.992
Our credit card came
in the mail today.

05:20.994 --> 05:22.527
See?
"Max Black".

05:22.529 --> 05:25.914
No more using the card
I found at Six Flags.

05:27.649 --> 05:32.620
Thank you for never checking
your statement, Agnes Chin.

05:32.622 --> 05:34.038
Girls, take my advice

05:34.040 --> 05:36.007
and be very careful
with that thing.

05:36.009 --> 05:37.625
Credit cards
are more trouble

05:37.627 --> 05:40.762
than a priest
at a Wiggles concert.

05:40.764 --> 05:42.497
Yes, Earl.

05:42.499 --> 05:45.550
I can't believe it.
A credit card for our business.

05:45.552 --> 05:47.685
So when are we getting
the shoes and lizards?

05:47.687 --> 05:48.987
Max, remember.

05:48.989 --> 05:50.638
We have to be grown-ups
about this.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.990
Of course.

05:51.992 --> 05:57.345
"Two lizards, please.
No, make it three."

05:57.347 --> 05:59.481
Hi, I'm looking for Earl.

05:59.483 --> 06:02.500
And no, I'm not here to return
a bag of skunky weed.

06:02.502 --> 06:05.853
Oh, my God.
I'm so excited to see you.

06:05.855 --> 06:08.306
Come on in, I'll take really,
really good care of you.

06:08.308 --> 06:11.025
Oh, you need to know I just
separated from my wife,

06:11.027 --> 06:13.694
so I'm a little vulnerable.

06:13.696 --> 06:15.863
She's not usually
this nice to customers.

06:15.865 --> 06:17.031
She's just excited.

06:17.033 --> 06:19.667
She's about to come
into some lizards.

06:21.003 --> 06:24.055
Yeah, again.

06:24.057 --> 06:25.840
I've been out
the dating pool for a while,

06:25.842 --> 06:30.228
so everything sound like
a sexual innuendo to me.

06:30.230 --> 06:32.680
He is not a customer.
Look at him.

06:32.682 --> 06:35.383
Don't you see the resemblance?

06:36.435 --> 06:41.322
Oh, my God
is he your father?

06:41.324 --> 06:44.075
Yes.
He's my father.

06:44.077 --> 06:46.778
And my mother is
a piece of chalk.

06:48.747 --> 06:50.081
Daddy!

06:50.083 --> 06:51.916
Thank God, it is
the one I thought.

06:51.918 --> 06:54.485
There's my little boy!

07:01.796 --> 07:03.630
So, Darius, what was
Earl like as a dad?

07:03.632 --> 07:04.714
It must have been great, huh?

07:04.716 --> 07:06.466
I bet he packed
the coolest lunches.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.553
A joint for recess,
and a gin and juice box.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.105
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He was a great dad.

07:12.107 --> 07:15.225
I mean, he was always there.
Except for my childhood.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.312
You've gotta laugh!

07:20.064 --> 07:22.465
Earl is sitting right there.

07:22.467 --> 07:26.769
Well, it's a joke.
Take it easy there, fun size.

07:26.771 --> 07:28.287
Han, take no offense.

07:28.289 --> 07:30.072
He's just pulling
your leg a little.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.041
Darius has always been funny.

07:32.043 --> 07:34.377
Why am I thinking
about Terrence?

07:34.379 --> 07:35.878
I don't know.
I'm the funny one, Dad.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.280
I don't recall there being
a Terrence in our family,

07:38.282 --> 07:41.551
but then again, I don't know
how far you've thrown your seed.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.503
You've gotta laugh.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.422
Do you?

07:46.424 --> 07:48.341
Darius was voted
the funniest salesman

07:48.343 --> 07:50.309
at the Chrysler dealership.

07:50.311 --> 07:52.678
Yes, I was.
And that's why I quit my job.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.981
To pursue my dream
to become a comedian.

07:58.236 --> 08:00.019
See?
See, he's funny.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.687
Always making jokes.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.606
That's not a joke, Daddy.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.858
No, no,
that's why I'm in town.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.444
To audition at the comedy club
tomorrow night.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.363
I already got my stage name.

08:10.365 --> 08:13.449
"Darius The Hilarious".

08:13.451 --> 08:15.084
I think
it's a good choice, right?

08:15.086 --> 08:18.654
Is it?

08:18.656 --> 08:21.507
Well, obviously, Big D,
we will all be there

08:21.509 --> 08:22.825
to support you.

08:22.827 --> 08:24.794
Will we?

08:24.796 --> 08:27.847
Hold up, Darius.
How did all of this happen?

08:27.849 --> 08:30.049
Well, I mean,
I knew a guy at Cadillac

08:30.051 --> 08:32.768
who knew a guy at Toyota
who knew a guy at Subaru

08:32.770 --> 08:34.854
who sold the club owner
a Dodge.

08:34.856 --> 08:36.639
And then he hit a kid with it.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.890
The kid should have dodged.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.027
You gotta laugh!

08:41.029 --> 08:44.313
There's a dead kid in the mix
and we got to laugh?

08:46.149 --> 08:47.516
It's not his fault
he's not funny.

08:47.518 --> 08:50.870
We put his sense of humor
on a high shelf.

08:50.872 --> 08:52.738
Hey, Max, you know,

08:52.740 --> 08:54.523
Daddy always told me
you were special,

08:54.525 --> 08:56.075
and now I see it.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.861
And it's not just because you
think everything I say is funny.

08:58.863 --> 09:00.246
You feel like family.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.499
I do? Oh, I always
wanted a brother...

09:03.501 --> 09:05.985
Who was a brother.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.174
Max, do you expect me to wait
on all the tables tonight?

09:12.176 --> 09:14.010
Well, I am kind of
in the middle of

09:14.012 --> 09:17.179
my family reunion right now.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.765
And where is
Mr. Hilarious' soup?

09:19.767 --> 09:21.517
Look at blondie, here.
She's like,

09:21.519 --> 09:26.155
"Oh my God, do black people
even eat soup?"

09:26.157 --> 09:29.224
"It's like, whatever."

09:29.226 --> 09:32.044
That is a dead-on Caroline.

09:32.046 --> 09:34.947
Is it?

09:36.399 --> 09:38.751
Here is your
order ticket from tonight.

09:38.753 --> 09:42.204
This pile is for
the people who found hair.

09:42.206 --> 09:46.042
These are the hairs
that the people found.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.910
Oh, you sound Russian.

09:47.912 --> 09:51.964
That's funny because you're not
rushin' to make my soup.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.749
No, no, no, no.
I'm kidding you, man.

09:53.751 --> 09:55.634
I get it.
You're just too busy back there

09:55.636 --> 09:58.354
not putting on deodorant.

09:58.356 --> 10:00.255
You gotta laugh.

10:00.257 --> 10:01.442
Do you?

10:03.644 --> 10:05.394
Max, I might be crazy
but now I feel like

10:05.396 --> 10:08.714
the heel of this shoe's
starting to--

10:08.716 --> 10:11.734
Oh, gosh.
Now I got to go wipe this down.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.403
You know, I was going to
wear this for my audition.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.654
And that's gotta go well.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.156
Yes, it does.
Because son,

10:17.158 --> 10:21.577
there are two jobs in Detroit,
and you just quit one of them.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.079
Don't worry, Daddy.
I'll make you proud.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.131
All right?
You'll see.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.632
Daddy's been wrong before.

10:26.634 --> 10:28.467
He didn't think I could
make it on <i>Soul Train,</i>

10:28.469 --> 10:29.885
but there I was,

10:29.887 --> 10:33.472
in the bottom left corner
on <i>Soul Train.</i>

10:38.145 --> 10:39.562
I feel so terrible.

10:39.564 --> 10:41.630
Well, you know we have
to buy him a new shirt.

10:41.632 --> 10:43.566
Max, I've made
seven dollars so far.

10:43.568 --> 10:44.967
We can't afford to buy
him a shirt.

10:44.969 --> 10:47.403
We can go shopping for
a reasonable shirt.

10:47.405 --> 10:49.304
We have to.
He's family.

10:49.306 --> 10:51.574
Is he?

10:51.576 --> 10:54.393
And I have to say, I don't like
that brand of put-down humor.

10:54.395 --> 10:55.694
And that blonde stereotype?

10:55.696 --> 10:57.163
I mean,
I don't even say "whatever".

10:57.165 --> 10:59.665
But, you know, it's fine.
Whatever.

11:05.756 --> 11:07.289
Max, slow down.

11:07.291 --> 11:11.043
I can't walk any faster
in Sophie's giant sneakers.

11:11.045 --> 11:15.014
I can't believe
she benches 250 in these.

11:15.016 --> 11:16.298
Oh, my God.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.500
My hand just touched
the subway floor.

11:18.502 --> 11:21.353
How do I know
someone didn't pee here?

11:21.355 --> 11:24.607
Oh, honey,
I've peed here.

11:24.609 --> 11:27.109
This is New York.
It's made of pee.

11:27.111 --> 11:30.362
And pee hand is what you get
for refusing to wear flat shoes.

11:30.364 --> 11:31.614
No way.

11:31.616 --> 11:33.115
I'm living so close
to the gutter as it is.

11:33.117 --> 11:35.684
I can't risk being any shorter.

11:35.686 --> 11:37.169
Here's where we're
meeting Darius.

11:37.171 --> 11:38.353
"Subway Style".

11:38.355 --> 11:40.372
Every time I walk by
this place I wonder

11:40.374 --> 11:42.241
"who would ever shop here?"

11:42.243 --> 11:44.293
Now I know--us.

11:44.295 --> 11:45.377
First my heel breaks,

11:45.379 --> 11:47.029
and now I'm
shopping underground.

11:47.031 --> 11:48.547
How much lower can I get?

11:48.549 --> 11:50.916
Brunch on the earth's core?

11:53.003 --> 11:56.422
Mmm, oh.
Excuse my mouthful.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.207
Mm, I wasn't expecting ladies.

11:58.209 --> 12:01.210
We usually just sell
to pimps and pastors.

12:01.212 --> 12:03.979
What can I help
you dolls with?

12:03.981 --> 12:05.981
Actually, we're just
here meeting a friend.

12:05.983 --> 12:07.516
We're going to help him
pick out a shirt.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.984
Oh, that guy?

12:08.986 --> 12:11.654
He's already in the dressing
room trying one on now.

12:11.656 --> 12:14.556
Now, listen,
if the price is too high,

12:14.558 --> 12:18.194
you and I can, uh, negotiate.

12:18.196 --> 12:21.313
Or you.

12:21.315 --> 12:23.398
I still can't believe
we're using our tip money

12:23.400 --> 12:24.583
to buy him a shirt.

12:24.585 --> 12:26.335
We're only going
to spend like $40.

12:26.337 --> 12:28.504
And you heard the man.
It can go down.

12:28.506 --> 12:30.956
If you go down.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.392
Oh, hey ladies.
There you are.

12:33.394 --> 12:35.294
Look, I switched it up
a little bit.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.912
Do you like me in pink?

12:36.914 --> 12:39.548
My boyfriend does.

12:39.550 --> 12:43.469
He says it makes my cheeks
look rosy, all four of them.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.188
You gotta laugh,
you gotta laugh!

12:46.190 --> 12:48.891
Darius, we're family,
so I'm just going to tell you

12:48.893 --> 12:50.025
like it is.

12:50.027 --> 12:52.528
That material
feels a little funky.

12:52.530 --> 12:55.197
I mean, that kind of humor might
have worked over at Toyota--

12:55.199 --> 12:56.365
- It's Chrysler.
- Whatever.

12:56.367 --> 12:59.034
But this is New York.
There are a lot of people,

12:59.036 --> 13:02.538
be them gays, or blondes,
who might take offense to that.

13:02.540 --> 13:05.107
I mean, I don't,
but, whatever.

13:05.109 --> 13:07.076
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just playing.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.712
That's not the kind of stuff
I'm gonna do in my act tonight.

13:09.714 --> 13:12.447
No, I wrote some real jokes
with a comic back home.

13:12.449 --> 13:14.283
And, he's Jewish, so you know
it's gonna be funny.

13:14.285 --> 13:15.834
And not cheap.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.670
Again, see?
That's the kind of stuff...

13:17.672 --> 13:20.756
Caroline, come on.
It's so wrong it's right.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.508
Look, I have
the jokes right here.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.977
Let's take them on a little
test drive and see how they do.

13:24.979 --> 13:27.346
All right?
So back it up, ladies.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.815
You going to need
some laughing room.

13:29.817 --> 13:32.768
This is going to be hilarious.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.320
Anybody here have a Smart Car?

13:34.322 --> 13:39.241
Because I don't think it's smart
to drive half a car.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.313
That was new,
I'll keep working on it.

13:44.315 --> 13:45.981
All right, let's try
another one.

13:45.983 --> 13:49.318
You know what, maybe
we weren't back far enough.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.502
Yeah!

13:50.504 --> 13:52.504
Yeah, that feels funnier
already, right Caroline?

13:53.858 --> 13:55.090
All right.

13:55.092 --> 13:57.376
You know who doesn't
drive a Smart Car?

13:57.378 --> 14:03.048
Smart people.
They don't do it.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.934
You gotta laugh.

14:04.936 --> 14:06.268
Seriously.

14:06.270 --> 14:10.005
You've got to.
I've got a lot riding on this.

14:10.007 --> 14:11.557
I just got it.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.278
Oh, my God.
He stinks.

14:16.280 --> 14:19.348
He stinks on ice.
Darius is gonna bomb tonight

14:19.350 --> 14:21.683
and worse, he's going to bomb
in front of Earl.

14:21.685 --> 14:25.687
And Earl's pretty sure that's
the son he's most proud of.

14:25.689 --> 14:27.522
You're right.
What are we gonna do?

14:27.524 --> 14:30.743
Now I know you lovely ladies
came in for a shirt,

14:30.745 --> 14:32.928
but can I interest you
in a nice suit?

14:32.930 --> 14:35.331
Look at this one.
It's a classic.

14:35.333 --> 14:39.218
You can't get
this color above ground.

14:39.220 --> 14:42.554
That's it.
Darius needs a suit.

14:42.556 --> 14:44.506
All the professional
comedians wear suits,

14:44.508 --> 14:45.808
and like you said,

14:45.810 --> 14:47.876
you have to dress
for the job you want.

14:47.878 --> 14:49.011
And with jokes like that,

14:49.013 --> 14:52.481
he needs the funniest suit
they have.

14:52.483 --> 14:55.334
Do you have anything from
the Sinbad collection?

14:55.336 --> 14:56.921
I do.

14:58.923 --> 15:01.273
Max, I don't think
the suit's gonna be enough.

15:01.275 --> 15:05.327
I think he needs something else,
you know, like, a puppet.

15:05.329 --> 15:06.895
A puppet?

15:06.897 --> 15:09.782
That's exactly
what he needs.

15:16.644 --> 15:18.744
I went out with
a guy last night.

15:19.046 --> 15:21.913
Asked me if we could go Dutch.

15:22.415 --> 15:24.316
I said, "I don't know."

15:24.318 --> 15:26.468
"What's Dutch for
cheap-ass bitch?"

15:29.255 --> 15:32.490
You kick him to the curb!

15:32.992 --> 15:34.192
We'll be right back,

15:34.194 --> 15:36.695
because Mama's gotta go
put her feet up.

15:36.697 --> 15:38.029
Uh, miss?

15:38.031 --> 15:39.597
Can we get another round
when you get a chance?

15:39.599 --> 15:40.782
Another round?

15:40.784 --> 15:43.735
And keep them coming until
we can no longer see.

15:43.737 --> 15:44.819
Put it on my card.

15:44.821 --> 15:45.820
You got it.

15:45.822 --> 15:48.073
Man, that feels good
every time.

15:48.075 --> 15:50.325
Hey, Max.
Just because

15:50.327 --> 15:51.442
you're buying me drinks

15:51.444 --> 15:55.163
doesn't mean
I'm going to put out.

15:55.165 --> 16:00.602
My celery stick is my
microphone at the comedy club!

16:00.604 --> 16:02.971
I'm here, I'm here.

16:02.973 --> 16:04.572
Did you get the puppet?

16:04.574 --> 16:07.625
Oh, I've got the puppet.

16:14.350 --> 16:16.634
Hey, come on in.

16:16.636 --> 16:19.687
Hey, girls.
How you doing?

16:19.689 --> 16:21.823
Darius The Hilarious is pumped.

16:21.825 --> 16:23.742
I'm totally in
my zone right now.

16:23.744 --> 16:26.477
And I can't miss
in this suit.

16:26.479 --> 16:29.030
Well...

16:29.032 --> 16:31.332
Darius, that's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

16:31.334 --> 16:33.151
- You know we're big fans.
- Big, big fans.

16:33.153 --> 16:34.702
You're amazing,
your act's incredible.

16:34.704 --> 16:35.987
Your Darius The Hilarious.

16:35.989 --> 16:37.956
Max and I love
the Smart Car stuff.

16:37.958 --> 16:40.458
It's hilarious,
per your name.

16:40.460 --> 16:41.843
But, well, it is New York.

16:41.845 --> 16:43.494
Not a lot of people
are smart, or have cars.

16:43.496 --> 16:44.879
Yeah, you know New York.

16:44.881 --> 16:46.548
Not exactly the cutting edge.

16:46.550 --> 16:48.466
So, after Max and I left you,
we had a thought.

16:48.468 --> 16:51.019
We got you a puppet.

16:51.021 --> 16:53.888
And, yes, I was stoned.
But Caroline was laughing

16:53.890 --> 16:56.891
just as hard as me.

16:56.893 --> 16:58.026
You got me a what?

16:58.028 --> 16:59.944
A puppet.
We got you a puppet.

16:59.946 --> 17:01.729
But I don't use a puppet.

17:01.731 --> 17:03.982
Until you do.

17:03.984 --> 17:05.733
Just imagine,
at the end of your act

17:05.734 --> 17:07.786
- or in the beginning...
- Or all the way through.

17:07.788 --> 17:10.454
Ladies and gentlemen,
Darius The Hilarious

17:10.457 --> 17:14.159
and his partner,
Justin Beaver!

17:16.945 --> 17:19.547
"Damn, girl.
And I mean dam."

17:19.549 --> 17:23.885
"As in, I built one."

17:23.887 --> 17:25.587
And you don't even
have to be funny because

17:25.589 --> 17:27.755
Justin Beaver does
the work for you.

17:27.757 --> 17:30.892
Show him, Max.

17:30.894 --> 17:32.376
"I'm straight".

17:35.015 --> 17:37.515
You gotta laugh!

17:37.517 --> 17:40.185
Do I?

17:40.187 --> 17:41.436
I mean, honestly?

17:41.438 --> 17:43.938
Making fun of
Justin beaver's Sexuality?

17:43.940 --> 17:46.107
I find that a tad offensive.

17:51.330 --> 17:55.033
This next act comes to us
from the Motor City.

17:55.035 --> 17:58.753
Please give it up for
Mr. Darius The Hilarious.

18:02.559 --> 18:06.261
All right.
How's everybody doing tonight?

18:06.963 --> 18:09.097
Who out there
has a Smart Car?

18:09.099 --> 18:12.550
Because I don't think it's smart
to drive a half a car.

18:12.552 --> 18:14.919
You gotta laugh.

18:17.390 --> 18:21.759
Oh, no.
I ran out of fake laughter.

18:21.761 --> 18:23.261
Yeah, I mean, Smart Car.

18:23.263 --> 18:24.946
Have you seen this thing?

18:24.948 --> 18:27.951
It's like you driving
around in a backpack.

18:29.953 --> 18:31.986
You gotta laugh.

18:31.988 --> 18:33.437
Do we?

18:33.439 --> 18:38.126
Why don't we have a Smart Car
write some jokes for you?

18:38.128 --> 18:41.079
Yeah, well, I can see why you
would defend the Smart Car.

18:41.081 --> 18:43.781
It's the only car your feet
can reach the pedals in.

18:48.138 --> 18:53.474
Yeah, but that's so true.
He's very short!

18:53.476 --> 18:58.146
As is the car.
It all lines up.

18:58.148 --> 19:00.098
Look at this
gray-haired scrub, man.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.518
Apparently black do crack.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.019
Hey, Don King called.

19:05.021 --> 19:07.138
Said he want
his whole head back.

19:08.974 --> 19:12.277
Max, look.
Look how proud Earl is.

19:12.279 --> 19:13.477
Hey, hey, hey, blondie.

19:13.479 --> 19:15.479
You mind not talking
until I finish?

19:15.481 --> 19:16.831
Wait, a minute.
You're probably just thinking,

19:16.833 --> 19:22.704
"Oh, my God. Shoes, shoes,
hairbrush, shoes."

19:22.706 --> 19:23.705
Oh, my God.

19:23.707 --> 19:28.042
I actually was
thinking about shoes!

19:28.044 --> 19:30.494
I'm sorry, there's
a problem with your card.

19:30.496 --> 19:32.347
It's been declined.

19:39.021 --> 19:40.438
Max.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.007
Darius told me what you did and
that was awful nice of you.

19:43.009 --> 19:45.676
Now, here.
I am reimbursing you

19:45.678 --> 19:48.730
for all of the clothes
and for that damn puppet.

19:48.732 --> 19:53.201
Although I swore I would
never pay for beaver.

19:53.203 --> 19:55.153
Do you think he'll
ever make it, Earl?

19:55.155 --> 19:58.022
Who's to say nowadays, Max?

19:58.024 --> 20:02.693
America's Got Talent.
Do they?

20:02.695 --> 20:05.380
All I know is he's my kid,
and you went out of your way

20:05.382 --> 20:07.248
to try and help him.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.801
Well, I just wanted
you to be proud.

20:09.803 --> 20:13.288
I am, Max.
Very proud.

20:16.825 --> 20:18.192
I just talked to Visa.

20:18.194 --> 20:23.381
I think they were disappointed
they had pre-approved us.

20:23.383 --> 20:26.217
Look, I killed it.
I had to.

20:26.219 --> 20:28.987
It was telling me
to buy a Harley.

20:28.989 --> 20:30.822
Okay, open dialogue.

20:30.824 --> 20:33.724
I used the credit card for
one more thing yesterday.

20:33.726 --> 20:36.577
Open dialogue.
So did I.

20:36.579 --> 20:39.113
It's the fanciest lipstick
Payless had.

20:39.115 --> 20:42.000
Aw.
And here.

20:42.002 --> 20:43.918
Max, are there lizards
in that bag?

20:43.920 --> 20:48.206
I wish.

20:48.208 --> 20:51.843
They're as good as new
and no bows.

20:51.845 --> 20:53.845
Max, where'd you find a cobbler?

20:53.847 --> 20:56.414
A cobbler?

20:56.416 --> 20:59.100
I took a time machine.

20:59.102 --> 21:00.584
I was supposed to
kill Hitler,

21:00.586 --> 21:03.271
but I thought your shoes
were more important.

21:03.273 --> 21:05.089
Okay, let's cut up your card.

21:05.091 --> 21:07.058
We should keep one
for business emergencies.

21:07.060 --> 21:08.276
We just have to have
to put it someplace where

21:08.278 --> 21:10.395
we'll never be tempted
to reach for it.

21:10.397 --> 21:12.113
Oleg, would you put this
down your pants?

21:12.115 --> 21:15.766
No problem.

21:17.072 --> 21:22.156
