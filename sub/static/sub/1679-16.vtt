00:00.220 --> 00:03.358
Kids, the key to a good
relationship is communication.

00:03.475 --> 00:05.720
- You need to talk.
- How about Mimi's?

00:05.750 --> 00:07.260
Nah, I don't really
feel like Mimi's.

00:07.290 --> 00:09.389
Well, I'm hungry.
Let's just pick a place and go.

00:09.419 --> 00:11.746
Oh, you know where we
should go? Cynthia's.

00:11.776 --> 00:13.477
You love that place--
remember what a great time we had

00:13.507 --> 00:14.501
the last time we were there?

00:14.531 --> 00:16.043
- We did?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:16.073 --> 00:18.798
We had that crazy waiter who kept going,
"You two should get married!

00:18.827 --> 00:20.400
You two should get married!"

00:20.633 --> 00:22.989
It's also important to
know when to stop talking.

00:23.017 --> 00:26.115
Come on. Then we stepped outside.
It was raining.

00:26.141 --> 00:27.999
It was so romantic?

00:28.029 --> 00:29.870
How can you not remember this?

00:30.397 --> 00:32.031
Because it wasn't me.

00:33.436 --> 00:35.203
Oh, right!

00:35.348 --> 00:36.793
It was...

00:37.125 --> 00:38.662
my sister.

00:39.528 --> 00:41.583
You see,
by the time you've hit your late 20s,

00:41.618 --> 00:43.010
you've dated a few people,

00:43.046 --> 00:45.591
but when you're in a relationship,
it's common courtesy to pretend

00:45.628 --> 00:46.560
that you haven't.

00:46.596 --> 00:49.220
Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on.

00:49.256 --> 00:50.920
Remember when we
went to see it?

00:50.955 --> 00:52.701
We sat in the back row.

00:53.315 --> 00:55.151
I've never seen Van Helsing.

00:55.187 --> 00:57.392
That's right.
I saw it with my sister.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.660
My boss just got
back from Maui.

01:00.698 --> 01:02.112
He said it was really romantic.

01:02.147 --> 01:03.733
Oh, it's so romantic.

01:03.767 --> 01:05.519
When were you in Maui?

01:06.136 --> 01:09.871
- I... went... with my sister.
- With my sister.

01:10.117 --> 01:11.613
Why do you always say that?

01:11.878 --> 01:15.532
Look, we're not 16.
We've both dated other people.

01:15.568 --> 01:17.682
It's silly to try to
act like we didn't.

01:17.715 --> 01:18.813
You're right.

01:18.868 --> 01:20.223
We should just be honest.

01:20.258 --> 01:21.350
Totally.

01:21.677 --> 01:23.183
See that girl over there?

01:24.005 --> 01:26.733
Three years ago,
I totally made out with her.

01:27.116 --> 01:28.703
I don't want to hear that.

01:28.738 --> 01:31.240
- What? You said...
- God, that is so insensitive.

01:31.277 --> 01:33.112
- Remember honesty...?
- You're a jerk!

01:33.877 --> 01:35.371
Well, you're...

01:35.577 --> 01:37.182
confusing.

01:52.066 --> 01:54.280
Okay, so you have to
have sex with one.

01:54.315 --> 01:58.093
Either classic mermaid;
bottom half fish, top half human,

01:58.127 --> 02:02.160
or inverted mermaid,
top half fish, bottom half human.

02:02.197 --> 02:03.240
Go!

02:03.615 --> 02:05.273
I don't know. Is she fat?

02:05.307 --> 02:08.050
Yeah, but it's a fish,
so it's the good kind of fat.

02:08.366 --> 02:10.310
Hot off the presses!

02:10.347 --> 02:11.871
I-I don't take flyers.

02:11.908 --> 02:13.810
You took one two seconds
before you walked in here.

02:13.847 --> 02:15.653
That's different.
It was for a strip club.

02:15.688 --> 02:16.622
Two bucks off wings.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.300
How much is your flyer
going to save me on wings?

02:18.337 --> 02:20.640
Fine. It's a flyer
from my play.

02:20.676 --> 02:23.410
Oh, Lily, I'd love to,
but we're not in college

02:23.447 --> 02:24.972
and I'm not trying
to sleep with you.

02:25.006 --> 02:27.672
- So anyway, this mermaid...
- Hey, Lily's friend asked her

02:27.708 --> 02:30.201
to be in this play,
and it's gonna be really good.

02:30.627 --> 02:33.751
Lily, I love you,
but we're too old for this.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.611
Asking someone to
come see your play

02:35.647 --> 02:38.223
is like asking someone
for a ride to the airport

02:38.258 --> 02:41.013
or to crash on your couch
or to help you move.

02:41.045 --> 02:42.661
Call a cab, book a room,

02:42.698 --> 02:44.751
hire some movers
and repeat after me:

02:44.785 --> 02:48.123
Friends  don't let friends
come see their crappy play.

02:48.425 --> 02:52.841
Okay, first of all,
I've thought about it and top half fish.

02:53.198 --> 02:55.831
Second of all, we need you guys
to decide something for us.

02:55.865 --> 02:57.231
Yes, you should break up.

02:59.358 --> 03:01.030
So, earlier tonight...

03:02.508 --> 03:05.151
Mm, we should get
down to the bar.

03:05.225 --> 03:06.952
I know we should,

03:07.377 --> 03:10.562
but you just look so sexy
in my red sweatshirt.

03:13.036 --> 03:15.881
Oh, God,
why is this part of the story?

03:15.917 --> 03:17.151
We're getting to it.

03:17.627 --> 03:20.611
Damn, my face is so dry.
Is there any moisturizer around here?

03:20.646 --> 03:22.192
Yeah, there's some
in the bathroom.

03:22.246 --> 03:23.822
Got to moisturize!

03:23.858 --> 03:26.091
Got to keep that
pretty face moist.

03:26.446 --> 03:29.090
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

03:29.305 --> 03:31.770
- What's wrong with her?
- She hates that word.

03:31.805 --> 03:35.070
- What word, "moist"?
- No! Seriously, stop!

03:35.426 --> 03:38.811
So, anyway, Ted goes into the
bathroom to get the moist...

03:39.116 --> 03:40.400
face lotion...

03:40.576 --> 03:42.220
Wow, this is great stuff.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.633
Now I know the secret to
your great complexion.

03:44.668 --> 03:46.223
What are you talking about?
It's yours.

03:46.248 --> 03:47.431
No, it's not.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.882
Oh, well...
then I guess it's Lily's.

03:49.915 --> 03:51.220
No, it's not.

03:51.978 --> 03:54.091
Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?

03:54.127 --> 03:55.551
Um, my sister's.

03:56.086 --> 03:58.953
So, in other words,
some girl you went out with.

03:58.986 --> 04:01.891
Um... I love you.

04:02.297 --> 04:06.340
Disgusting. You let me put on the
same moisturizer as one of your exes?

04:06.375 --> 04:09.303
It was probably Carla's.
Her face was a train wreck.

04:09.425 --> 04:12.011
I'm don't think Ted was
dating her for her face.

04:13.037 --> 04:14.223
Thank you, Marshall.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.731
Thank you so much.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.480
Why is that still
in your apartment?

04:18.517 --> 04:20.291
I don't know.
I just never threw it out.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.912
Well, why not? Do you still
have feelings for this girl?

04:22.946 --> 04:25.302
Yeah. I'm madly
in love with her,

04:25.335 --> 04:26.863
and the only way
I can deal with it

04:26.896 --> 04:29.111
is by holding onto a
three-dollar tube of lotion.

04:29.145 --> 04:31.320
Not three dollars! Try 14.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.843
Why is this such a big deal?

04:34.875 --> 04:37.893
Because I don't want to use
some whore's moisturizer!

04:37.926 --> 04:39.882
Whoa, she wasn't a whore.

04:39.915 --> 04:43.041
Well, she's leaving expensive
lotions all over town.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.682
It sounds like a whore to me.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.443
What else do you have from old
girlfriends just lying around?

04:47.476 --> 04:49.042
Nothing. That's it.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.541
Well, except for
the phone booth.

04:52.027 --> 04:54.111
And the lamp by the desk...

04:54.947 --> 04:56.231
and the...

04:58.007 --> 04:59.301
No.

05:00.266 --> 05:04.030
No! No! Oh, Ted!

05:04.096 --> 05:06.310
Ah, the age-old question:

05:06.348 --> 05:08.901
after  you break up with someone,
what do you do with the stuff?

05:08.935 --> 05:11.260
Question? Ain't no
question, girl.

05:11.298 --> 05:12.982
Obviously, he's got
to get rid of it.

05:13.016 --> 05:16.132
Which is obviously crazy and obviously,
I'm not gonna do it.

05:16.166 --> 05:19.073
So we agreed that we 
would let you guys decide.

05:19.108 --> 05:21.150
Yeah, like we did with
Marshall's pants.

05:21.306 --> 05:26.580
Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v.
The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.

05:30.006 --> 05:31.333
Nice, right?

05:32.126 --> 05:33.823
I'm gonna have to say no.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.810
I don't want some 16-year-old
girl falling in love with you

05:36.845 --> 05:38.612
and then shooting
Lily in the face.

05:38.646 --> 05:39.642
Yes!

05:40.126 --> 05:42.242
I vote they can stay.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.632
"Check out the jackass in the
parachute pants" is a good icebreaker.

05:46.485 --> 05:47.381
T ed.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.202
Ted? Ted?

05:50.238 --> 05:52.372
Sorry, buddy,
it's a "no" for me, too.

05:52.506 --> 05:54.980
Oh, and by the way,
Bel Biv Devoe called.

05:55.038 --> 05:57.160
Even they don't want
those pants back.

05:57.293 --> 05:59.509
They were insanely comfortable!

05:59.537 --> 06:01.915
They were like pajamas
you could wear outside.

06:01.941 --> 06:03.639
Marshall, it's over.

06:03.679 --> 06:07.462
We even gave you an appeal and they
didn't look any better with combat boots.

06:08.567 --> 06:11.351
All right, well, let's hear the
arguments. Ted, you go first.

06:11.385 --> 06:15.272
Okay. The fact that I still have things
from ex-girlfriends is no big deal.

06:15.305 --> 06:17.341
I mean,
when I see the phone booth on the piano,

06:17.405 --> 06:19.041
I don't think of
Jeannie Radford,

06:19.076 --> 06:21.611
I think of the good times I
had backpacking through Europe.

06:21.646 --> 06:24.772
And when I see the lamp,
I don't think of Allison Moses.

06:24.806 --> 06:27.013
I remember when I was broke,
just out of college,

06:27.045 --> 06:28.792
and I really needed a lamp.

06:28.827 --> 06:32.022
And when I see that throw pillow,
I don't think of Lauren Stein.

06:32.057 --> 06:35.030
I think of that weird orange-brown
stain and how it got there.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.890
Creamsicle and turkey gravy,

06:36.928 --> 06:38.390
not at the same time.

06:39.147 --> 06:40.512
Well, that's adorable,

06:40.546 --> 06:44.290
but from now on, when I walk into the
apartment, here is what I will see.

06:45.417 --> 06:49.912
I'm Ted's college girlfriend.
He made me 12 mix tapes.

06:49.945 --> 06:51.841
How many has he made you?

06:53.636 --> 06:55.830
He calls you "sweetie pie"?

06:55.936 --> 06:57.970
He called me "sweetie pie."

06:59.875 --> 07:03.870
I'm stupid,
but my rack is bigger than yours.

07:05.215 --> 07:07.613
Really? You can't
look at a pillow

07:07.645 --> 07:09.683
without seeing my ex-girlfriend--
a pillow!

07:09.718 --> 07:13.070
Yes, Ted, the fact that you still
have that pillow is creepy and gross.

07:13.108 --> 07:15.860
- You're creepy and gross.
- Your mom's creepy and gross.

07:15.927 --> 07:17.683
Order! Order!

07:19.007 --> 07:20.711
I got to side with Robin.

07:20.746 --> 07:24.000
She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff
upsets her, you got to get rid of it.

07:24.038 --> 07:25.832
I've got to side with Ted.

07:25.885 --> 07:27.932
Just 'cause you still have
something an ex-girlfriend gave you

07:27.965 --> 07:29.661
doesn't mean you're
holding onto her.

07:29.826 --> 07:31.092
All right, Barney.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.133
It all comes down to you.

07:34.278 --> 07:36.430
- I side with Robin.
- What?

07:36.467 --> 07:38.203
Ted, your place
is too cluttered.

07:38.237 --> 07:40.481
It's like you're living
in a Bennigan's.

07:40.945 --> 07:42.530
Or a Danby's.

07:44.016 --> 07:46.342
What, they don't have
Danby's in the US?

07:46.975 --> 07:48.221
Really?

07:48.428 --> 07:51.442
Well, then were do you get
Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?

07:51.478 --> 07:53.072
Just stop, sweetie.

07:55.738 --> 07:56.942
So I had no choice.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.652
I packed up everything I had
gotten from ex-girlfriends.

07:59.745 --> 08:01.072
It was painful,

08:01.205 --> 08:04.391
but not as painful as what I
had to endure later that night.

08:05.748 --> 08:07.870
New York is famous
for its theater,

08:07.906 --> 08:09.530
but there's many
different levels.

08:09.565 --> 08:10.982
There's Broadway,

08:11.018 --> 08:12.651
off-Broadway,

08:12.687 --> 08:14.491
off-off-Broadway,

08:14.526 --> 08:16.751
homeless people
screaming in the park,

08:16.786 --> 08:19.913
and then below that,
the play Aunt Lily was in.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.431
Eight flights, of stairs.

08:22.467 --> 08:25.471
Who puts a theater up
eight flights of stairs?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.001
What kind of building is this?

08:27.037 --> 08:30.222
From the smell of it,
I'm guessing a urine factory.

08:30.808 --> 08:32.241
Where do you guys want to sit?

08:33.207 --> 08:35.633
I know where I
don't want to sit.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.312
Guys, four together!

08:41.086 --> 08:43.361
I brought a bag in case
anyone needs to puke.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.901
Come on.
It's not gonna be that bad.

08:44.935 --> 08:46.561
No? Okay.

09:00.788 --> 09:06.023
I... am... Rage!

09:09.848 --> 09:12.152
I... am Greed.

09:15.647 --> 09:19.920
I am Rage... Envy!

09:20.296 --> 09:22.112
I am outta here.

09:22.146 --> 09:24.322
No, you're not.
You have to stay.

09:26.877 --> 09:31.081
This is the face
of Consumerism!

09:31.115 --> 09:33.642
Oh, my God.
Ted's part of the play.

09:39.587 --> 09:44.673
Hello, Greed, Rage...

09:45.196 --> 09:46.761
Envy...

09:47.395 --> 09:51.830
and Consumerism.

09:55.208 --> 09:58.982
I... am your father...

09:59.545 --> 10:01.501
America!

10:17.407 --> 10:19.982
Oh, baby, that was wonderful!

10:20.017 --> 10:22.350
Totally, I had no idea
Greed was the killer.

10:22.387 --> 10:24.142
And when it became a
play within a play,

10:24.177 --> 10:26.541
I was, like,
"Now we are really cookin'!"

10:26.606 --> 10:29.552
Wow, Lily, that sucked!

10:30.336 --> 10:31.401
Barney!

10:31.436 --> 10:33.040
What? It was terrible.

10:33.475 --> 10:35.392
I mean, come on.
You guys agree, right?

10:35.878 --> 10:39.060
Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest
'cause, you know, we're friends.

10:39.095 --> 10:41.812
No, friends make each
other feel good.

10:41.848 --> 10:44.093
They build each other
up and support them.

10:44.128 --> 10:46.432
That's what being a
good friend is about.

10:46.555 --> 10:48.741
Yeah, if you're a Smurf.

10:48.947 --> 10:51.533
You know if you did a play,
I would sit through the whole thing

10:51.568 --> 10:53.890
and I would compliment
you on it afterwards.

10:53.928 --> 10:55.251
Oh, really? You would?

10:55.286 --> 10:56.331
Yes.

10:56.385 --> 10:59.790
Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.

11:00.968 --> 11:03.730
We'll be starting our
Q&A with the director--

11:03.765 --> 11:05.062
yours truly--

11:05.275 --> 11:07.571
in five minutes right here.

11:11.958 --> 11:14.610
Can you believe Barney said
that about Lily's play?

11:14.647 --> 11:16.591
I know.
He can be really insensitive.

11:17.085 --> 11:18.552
It was pretty bad, though.

11:18.588 --> 11:20.291
Oh, my God, it was so bad.

11:26.425 --> 11:28.092
Oh, my God, you've been robbed!

11:28.125 --> 11:29.192
Nope.

11:33.055 --> 11:35.733
All that stuff was
from old girlfriends?

11:37.397 --> 11:40.102
Don't you buy anything
for yourself?

11:40.138 --> 11:41.543
What can I say?

11:41.588 --> 11:43.210
Papa gets swag.

11:44.315 --> 11:47.402
And that should've been the end of it.
But the next day...

11:47.437 --> 11:49.813
You know, at first I was really bummed
about getting rid of all my stuff.

11:49.846 --> 11:52.401
But seeing how happy it makes you--
totally worth it.

11:52.437 --> 11:55.071
Mm, that's kind of how I feel when
I begrudgingly have sex with you

11:55.107 --> 11:56.250
when I'm really tired.

11:56.288 --> 11:59.063
Exactly. Sometimes you
gotta take one for the team.

12:00.675 --> 12:02.933
Well, sit. Sit, yeah.

12:02.967 --> 12:05.303
So you never keep anything
your ex-boyfriends gave you?

12:05.337 --> 12:06.402
Nope.

12:06.437 --> 12:08.313
Well, except for my dogs.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.692
So I had to get rid of everything
from my past relationships

12:25.725 --> 12:28.243
because you don't keep things
from your past relationships

12:28.278 --> 12:31.542
except, uh, where are your five
dogs from? Oh, that's right:

12:31.575 --> 12:33.172
your past relationships.

12:33.205 --> 12:34.500
What's your point, Ted?

12:34.538 --> 12:37.100
Well, you know how you said 
you come over to my apartment,

12:37.137 --> 12:39.353
and all you can see
are my ex-girlfriends?

12:39.386 --> 12:42.911
What, so when you look at my dogs,
all you see is my ex-boyfriends?

12:48.217 --> 12:49.663
I do now.

12:50.948 --> 12:52.411
That's ridiculous.

12:52.446 --> 12:55.010
I thought you said you got rid of
everything your ex-boyfriends gave you.

12:55.045 --> 12:56.633
Well, yeah, but not my dogs.

12:56.665 --> 12:57.471
You said everything.

12:57.505 --> 12:59.081
But not living things.

12:59.117 --> 13:02.040
Well, tell that to the rare
Bolivian cactus I threw away.

13:02.146 --> 13:04.260
Things with a
heartbeat can stay.

13:07.526 --> 13:08.850
Enjoying this?

13:08.888 --> 13:10.921
Pickles, go get your ball.

13:11.508 --> 13:12.563
Go get your ball.

13:17.386 --> 13:19.961
Just admit it.
It was a little hypocritical of you

13:19.996 --> 13:21.542
to make me get rid
of all my stuff.

13:21.578 --> 13:24.840
Well, what do you want me to do, Ted?
Get rid of my dogs?

13:26.856 --> 13:28.893
Guess what position
we did it in.

13:29.318 --> 13:31.722
Yes. Yes,
I want you to get rid of your dogs.

13:31.757 --> 13:33.511
Um, no.

13:38.415 --> 13:41.612
Really? Well,
I say we take it to the group,

13:41.646 --> 13:44.352
but I don't like your chances.

13:44.475 --> 13:47.293
She's not getting
rid of the dogs.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.113
What's the matter with you?

13:49.147 --> 13:51.353
- Even I wouldn't do that.
- Yes!

13:51.586 --> 13:54.791
You can ask somebody to get rid of their
iguana after it poops in your hair,

13:54.826 --> 13:56.611
but not their dog.

13:56.677 --> 13:58.423
I miss Jebediah.

13:58.955 --> 14:00.441
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:00.726 --> 14:03.393
Flyers for my new play.

14:03.648 --> 14:04.892
Very funny.

14:04.925 --> 14:06.033
Oh, it's not a joke.

14:06.067 --> 14:08.390
It's my one-man show
premiering tomorrow night.

14:08.428 --> 14:11.171
And even though it's terrible
and excruciatingly long,

14:11.208 --> 14:13.861
I expect you all to be there
since we're such good friends.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.040
Oh, we'll be there.

14:15.076 --> 14:17.181
Unless, of course, you just want
to admit that you were wrong...

14:17.217 --> 14:18.722
- Never.
- Good.

14:18.886 --> 14:21.263
Okay, I gotta go rehearse.

14:21.558 --> 14:24.051
Oh, I almost forgot.
Bring a poncho;

14:24.086 --> 14:25.633
the first three rows get wet.

14:40.306 --> 14:42.993
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
where the dogs came from.

14:43.937 --> 14:45.722
I'm sorry I asked you
to get rid of them.

14:45.755 --> 14:47.262
That was ridiculous.

14:48.358 --> 14:50.222
So we're-we're okay?

14:50.265 --> 14:51.493
Yeah, we're great. 

14:52.168 --> 14:53.673
And I thought we were,

14:53.705 --> 14:56.840
but just as it did in the
seventh act of Aunt Lily's play,

14:56.877 --> 14:59.222
Jealousy reared its ugly head.

15:07.135 --> 15:10.482
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

15:25.456 --> 15:26.951
Dude, I gotta pee.

15:29.245 --> 15:30.702
I gotta go.

15:36.255 --> 15:39.002
Oh, he's really having trouble
dealing with this, huh?

15:39.035 --> 15:40.512
Yeah, he really is.

15:40.586 --> 15:43.723
It's got me thinking,
maybe I should get rid of my dogs.

15:44.028 --> 15:46.193
Might be time to send
them to the farm.

15:46.225 --> 15:48.902
- You're gonna kill your dogs?!
- No! No, no, no,

15:48.938 --> 15:50.450
there really is a farm.

15:50.506 --> 15:52.263
My aunt has a farm upstate.

15:52.297 --> 15:53.731
Oh, thank God.

15:53.865 --> 15:56.142
Aw, you know,
if I were five dogs,

15:56.177 --> 15:59.793
I'd rather live on a farm than
in an apartment in Brooklyn.

15:59.827 --> 16:02.630
Yeah. I could visit
them on weekends.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.470
My aunt is awfully lonely up there.
It's just her and her lover, Betty.

16:06.508 --> 16:09.453
Oh, that's perfect.
They love dogs.

16:09.786 --> 16:11.600
"They"? What do
you mean by "they"?

16:11.637 --> 16:14.202
Uh... uh.... uh...
People upstate.

16:14.236 --> 16:15.821
Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!

16:18.625 --> 16:20.140
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

16:20.177 --> 16:21.430
I mean,
you know that this is gonna be...

16:21.467 --> 16:24.253
I know, but I'm gonna sit
through the whole thing,

16:24.285 --> 16:26.720
and I'm gonna say something
nice about it afterwards.

16:26.757 --> 16:27.670
You know why?

16:27.706 --> 16:29.481
Because that's what friends do.

16:45.418 --> 16:46.472
Moist.

16:48.395 --> 16:49.400
Moist.

16:50.295 --> 16:51.201
Moist.

16:52.628 --> 16:53.500
Moist.

16:53.586 --> 16:55.622
That was the first 40
minutes of Barney's show.

16:55.658 --> 16:56.692
Moist.

16:58.316 --> 17:01.033
And then we endured
about 20 minutes of this.

17:13.036 --> 17:14.593
I have to go refill.

17:15.078 --> 17:16.470
I'll be back in a moment.

17:16.508 --> 17:17.762
Play's not over.

17:21.417 --> 17:23.791
I never get picked for
audience participation.

17:25.415 --> 17:27.161
And then it just got weird.

17:31.516 --> 17:32.960
Feelings.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.200
Inside.

17:36.496 --> 17:38.392
Oh, no!

17:48.205 --> 17:49.930
And when that didn't work...

18:08.245 --> 18:10.710
Okay! Stop!

18:10.786 --> 18:12.512
You win. Fine.

18:12.565 --> 18:16.153
Barney, I'm sorry I made
you come to my show.

18:16.188 --> 18:17.282
Thank you, Lily.

18:17.318 --> 18:19.462
Is there anything you'd
like to say about my show?

18:19.496 --> 18:20.413
No.

18:20.445 --> 18:23.800
No, I have nothing nice
to say about your show.

18:23.835 --> 18:25.270
You were right, Barney.

18:25.306 --> 18:26.643
Let's go to the bar.

18:26.675 --> 18:29.060
Yes! I win!

18:29.096 --> 18:30.792
I love winning!

18:30.828 --> 18:34.231
Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily.

18:34.268 --> 18:36.342
I was just getting
warmed up, man!

18:36.372 --> 18:39.483
If you had any idea what was
coming up in act two... oh!

18:39.625 --> 18:42.600
Well, I imagine it was pretty awful,
so let's go.

18:42.635 --> 18:45.962
Pretty awful? Pretty awful?!
It was a masterpiece of awful.

18:45.998 --> 18:49.482
It's genius how bad it is.
I kind of wish you guys could see it.

18:49.516 --> 18:51.180
Yeah, well, anyway.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.610
Act two is where I
really hit my stride.

18:54.645 --> 18:57.393
Spoiler alert:
the robot falls in love.

18:59.476 --> 19:02.401
How about this, Barney?
How about we stay

19:02.437 --> 19:05.461
and-and watch the
rest of your show?

19:08.967 --> 19:10.251
It's your funeral.

19:11.577 --> 19:13.573
Five, six, one, two.

19:16.466 --> 19:19.793
So we stayed and let Barney torture
us for another hour and a half,

19:19.827 --> 19:22.781
'cause that's what
friends do, apparently.

19:24.938 --> 19:25.872
Hey.

19:26.158 --> 19:27.992
Where've you been?
I called you earlier.

19:28.025 --> 19:30.633
I gave my dogs away to my aunt.

19:30.666 --> 19:31.802
You what?

19:31.836 --> 19:35.660
Yeah. Just for a few months
as a test run, but...

19:36.297 --> 19:38.031
I think it's for the best.

19:38.505 --> 19:39.800
Wow.

19:40.705 --> 19:42.733
Oh, man.

19:44.818 --> 19:46.402
Can we go inside?

19:46.437 --> 19:48.813
Uh, no.
Uh, let's go to the bar.

19:48.845 --> 19:50.473
Why? What's going on inside?

19:50.506 --> 19:52.801
- Um, the floors are gone.
- What?

19:52.837 --> 19:55.351
Yeah. I-I sent them out to get,
um, fixed.

19:55.387 --> 19:57.373
This is a terrible lie.
I'm just going to bail.

20:10.298 --> 20:12.072
I didn't know you were
getting rid of the dogs!

20:12.106 --> 20:14.020
You said you threw
all that stuff away!

20:14.055 --> 20:17.113
Kids, this was the worst
fight Robin and I ever had.

20:17.197 --> 20:19.560
It was one of those fights
that last for hours

20:19.597 --> 20:22.741
and you start to get woozy and lose
track of what you're fighting about.

20:23.036 --> 20:26.562
We fought for so long,
seasons changed outside the window.

20:26.666 --> 20:29.431
Pages of the calendar blew off.
It was crazy.

20:30.087 --> 20:33.051
But, ultimately, and I couldn't
tell you how for the life of me,

20:33.085 --> 20:35.673
but somehow we got to here.

20:39.327 --> 20:41.240
We're really doing this?

20:42.705 --> 20:43.822
Yeah.

20:44.695 --> 20:46.853
- We're moving in together!
- We're moving in together!

20:53.085 --> 20:55.742
The robot found love

20:55.777 --> 20:57.631
Confusing my circuitry

20:57.666 --> 20:59.793
My software's been hacked

20:59.826 --> 21:01.451
Toaster oven

21:01.486 --> 21:08.672
You're the one for me

21:10.317 --> 21:11.933
Two, three, four.

21:20.395 --> 21:21.820
That's two.
