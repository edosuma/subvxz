WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:03.348
[Woods]  There's starting to be
a certain amount of noise

00:03.382 --> 00:04.694
about one of the girls

00:04.728 --> 00:06.420
and the Secretary of State
for War.

00:06.454 --> 00:08.180
Profumo?

00:08.215 --> 00:10.769
-It's you and Christine.
-Nonsense, Bill. Absolute tosh.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.495
Christine who?

00:12.529 --> 00:14.186
[chuckles]

00:14.221 --> 00:16.085
Can't really stop, Lucky,
were in a bit of a rush.

00:16.119 --> 00:18.604
You think I can't follow you
everywhere you go?

00:19.674 --> 00:21.676
[Stephen]
Christine, look at you.

00:21.711 --> 00:23.747
Your face is your fortune.

00:25.266 --> 00:26.888
[Christine]  I was really
in love with Johnny.

00:26.923 --> 00:28.649
-[gunshots]
-[girls screaming]

00:31.272 --> 00:32.584
Stephen,
Johnny is trying to kill us.

00:33.240 --> 00:36.450
[Alan] We would love to hear
your story, Christine.

00:36.484 --> 00:37.727
Think about it.

00:53.329 --> 00:55.296
Thank you.

00:55.331 --> 00:57.643
[Christine]  The men in my life
have taught me many things,

00:58.610 --> 01:01.889
though you could say some things  don't need to be taught.

01:12.279 --> 01:13.314
Jack.

01:14.660 --> 01:17.215
Ah... Stephen.

01:19.976 --> 01:22.875
-Good evening, Mr. Profumo!
-Good evening.

01:22.910 --> 01:23.876
Christine.

01:23.911 --> 01:25.602
Eugene.

01:26.396 --> 01:28.329
[Stephen]
Er, I'll be back late.

01:28.364 --> 01:29.813
[laughs]

01:29.848 --> 01:32.954
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do, little baby.

01:32.989 --> 01:34.508
I will.

01:35.267 --> 01:36.475
[clears his throat]

01:39.409 --> 01:41.204
[door closing]

01:45.967 --> 01:48.177
[Christine]
When I met John Profumo,

01:48.211 --> 01:51.628
we both gave in
to the most natural
instinct there is,

01:51.663 --> 01:54.666
the love of a powerful
middle aged man

01:54.700 --> 01:57.151
for a penniless teenage girl.

01:58.532 --> 01:59.740
Is that a crime?

02:00.603 --> 02:05.746
[theme song]

02:29.321 --> 02:31.323
[people shouting]

02:31.358 --> 02:33.670
Mr. Profumo has been
less than honest

02:33.705 --> 02:35.293
with the House
about this matter!

02:35.327 --> 02:37.226
[ruckus]

02:37.260 --> 02:39.711
Mr. Speaker,
if the Honourable Member
is calling me a liar--

02:39.745 --> 02:41.782
-[ruckus]
-Mr. Speaker!

02:41.816 --> 02:45.268
Mr. Speaker,
the Secretary of State for War
gave firm assurances

02:45.303 --> 02:48.444
that during this unprecedented
global crisis,

02:48.478 --> 02:50.894
the budget for equipping
our troops would be increased.

02:50.929 --> 02:53.242
[all shouting] Yes!

02:53.276 --> 02:57.729
He has shown himself
to be disobliging,
dishonourable and disingenuous!

02:57.763 --> 02:59.627
[all shouting] Yes!

02:59.662 --> 03:02.872
The Honourable Member
for Dudley is misinformed...

03:02.906 --> 03:03.976
[murmuring]

03:04.011 --> 03:06.772
...mistaken, and maladroit!

03:06.807 --> 03:09.465
[all laugh]

03:09.499 --> 03:13.883
No one, Mr. Speaker,
no one takes the security
of this country

03:13.917 --> 03:15.816
more seriously than I do.

03:15.850 --> 03:20.338
[cheering and applause]

03:20.372 --> 03:23.444
So you do know this girl, Jack?
Christine Keeler?

03:23.479 --> 03:26.723
[Redmayne] Awful business,
this shooting at Wimpole Mews.

03:26.758 --> 03:29.761
Let me see... I stopped
visiting Ward's months ago.

03:29.795 --> 03:32.764
You shit, Profumo.
You gave me your word.

03:34.455 --> 03:35.732
Idiot.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.978
You can check the dates
with the Prime Minister's
office, if you like.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.807
Look, the PM's office
spoke to you?

03:41.842 --> 03:44.603
Well, about visiting
Wimpole Mews, yes.

03:44.638 --> 03:48.918
Stephen's just an acquaintance.
He's a very good bone man.

03:48.952 --> 03:51.403
Never mind the doctor, Jack,
what about the girl?

03:51.438 --> 03:55.476
Look, certain rumours
have been making
their way to me.

03:56.374 --> 03:58.997
A bit on the side is one thing,

03:59.929 --> 04:02.828
But negroes and guns...

04:02.863 --> 04:06.073
The issue as presented to me
was being seen at Ward's.

04:06.107 --> 04:08.972
There's an attachÃ©
from the Russian embassy
he hangs about with.

04:09.007 --> 04:11.975
The girl didn't come into it.
Or negroes, for that matter.

04:12.010 --> 04:15.082
Frankly, Martin,
I would have thought you whips
had other fish to fry.

04:16.428 --> 04:17.878
At least it's not boys.

04:19.397 --> 04:20.743
Oh, Christ.

04:22.434 --> 04:24.298
So you're saying
nothing happened?

04:24.333 --> 04:26.093
Pure as the driven, old cock.

04:27.025 --> 04:28.337
Have you seen her?

04:29.683 --> 04:32.548
Common little piece,
but legs that would shame
Helen of Troy.

04:32.582 --> 04:33.756
Yes.

04:35.033 --> 04:37.035
[lawyer]
To be clear, Miss Keeler,

04:37.069 --> 04:40.383
was Mr. Edgecombe actually
threatening you with the gun,

04:40.418 --> 04:43.628
or was he using it
to blow the lock off the door?

04:44.145 --> 04:47.735
-He was definitely
aiming the gun at me.
-It wasn't like that!

04:47.770 --> 04:49.323
You was winding me up,
Christine!

04:49.358 --> 04:52.119
[judge] That's quite enough,
Mr. Edgecombe.

04:52.947 --> 04:54.052
Go on, Miss Keeler.

04:56.537 --> 04:58.125
He aimed the gun at me.

04:59.713 --> 05:02.750
I saw the bullet coming
straight towards me,
and I ducked.

05:02.785 --> 05:03.924
[audience laughs]

05:03.958 --> 05:05.546
[lawyer] I see.

05:05.581 --> 05:08.584
You saw a bullet
coming towards you.

05:09.826 --> 05:12.898
You must have
remarkable eyesight,
Miss Keeler.

05:12.933 --> 05:13.968
[audience laughs]

05:14.003 --> 05:16.350
[judge] I will have quiet!

05:18.179 --> 05:19.767
What I mean is,

05:21.390 --> 05:24.979
if I hadn't ducked,
the bullet would have hit me.

05:26.395 --> 05:28.155
[Christine]
Johnny wanted to kill me!

05:28.189 --> 05:30.537
[judge] Thank you, Miss Keeler.

05:35.783 --> 05:39.408
[judge] The case
will be committed for trial
at the Central Criminal court.

05:39.442 --> 05:42.065
First hearing, 1st February.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.551
Application for bail refused.

05:44.585 --> 05:46.069
-[murmuring]
-It's not right.

05:46.104 --> 05:48.900
Old Bailey job, lads.
We've hit the jackpot.

05:48.934 --> 05:51.937
Good grief. This ain't right!

05:51.972 --> 05:53.111
It's a stitch up!

05:53.145 --> 05:54.837
[Johnny] Christine!

05:54.871 --> 05:57.218
You know I never meant
to hurt you, Christine!

05:57.253 --> 05:59.220
[Johnny] I'd never hurt you.

05:59.255 --> 06:01.602
Come and look at me!

06:07.884 --> 06:10.404
Christine, got a minute?

06:10.956 --> 06:13.614
[murmuring]

06:18.964 --> 06:21.139
Christine, I just want to talk.

06:23.106 --> 06:27.801
[journalists murmuring]

06:27.835 --> 06:30.735
[Lucky] Actually a chance
to see justice done, Stephen!

06:30.769 --> 06:32.219
Just a moment, Lucky.

06:32.253 --> 06:33.462
Little baby!

06:44.231 --> 06:46.958
Will there be more
in the newspapers after today?

06:48.028 --> 06:51.100
I imagine they'll just report
on the pre-trial hearing.

06:51.756 --> 06:52.895
Dry stuff.

06:54.517 --> 06:57.727
Though God knows Christine
could certainly provide them
with plenty of material.

06:58.797 --> 07:02.491
[chuckles] You have nothing
to worry about, Eugene.

07:02.525 --> 07:04.527
Legally, the newspapers
can't print anything

07:04.562 --> 07:07.530
until after Johnny's trial
is out the way.

07:07.565 --> 07:11.776
But the girls can tell
journalists a lot of things,
apart from this shooting.

07:13.502 --> 07:15.504
I mean Christine and Profumo.

07:15.538 --> 07:18.645
Jack has extremely deep pockets.

07:18.679 --> 07:20.888
The newspapers
wouldn't dare go near him.

07:20.923 --> 07:25.099
And dear as Christine and Mandy
are to me,

07:25.134 --> 07:27.964
they're not the most reliable
of sources, are they?

07:29.932 --> 07:31.968
I'll talk to Christine.

07:37.318 --> 07:39.528
Come on, Eugene.

07:39.562 --> 07:41.150
Look, this is not a joke for me.

07:41.184 --> 07:42.841
The police, the newspapers.

07:42.876 --> 07:45.844
If Christine mentions my name,

07:45.879 --> 07:47.708
it won't be a joke
for you either.

07:47.743 --> 07:50.918
You have no cause to worry.
Nothing will come out.

07:51.678 --> 07:54.232
I have it all under control.
Hmm?

07:55.164 --> 07:56.614
[chuckles]

07:57.615 --> 07:59.651
Many of my most
long-standing friendships

07:59.686 --> 08:01.619
rely on my absolute discretion.

08:03.586 --> 08:05.312
[Stephen] You know that.

08:44.972 --> 08:50.322
[sighs] Like I say,
the story behind the story.

08:51.013 --> 08:54.085
Who is the real
Christine Keeler?

08:57.122 --> 09:01.955
The thing is, Alan,
I've just been living my life.

09:01.989 --> 09:03.335
Quite boring really.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.099
You're queer.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.376
Jesus.

09:09.410 --> 09:10.929
Sorry.

09:12.379 --> 09:15.589
Don't worry, you can't tell,
you're not like a Nancy
or anything,

09:16.763 --> 09:20.076
Thing is, Alan,
I understand, because people...

09:21.215 --> 09:23.908
Some people are ignorant,
aren't they?

09:24.840 --> 09:26.220
Like me, liking...

09:26.807 --> 09:28.637
West Indian gentlemen.

09:30.293 --> 09:32.054
Do you think I'm disgusting?

09:33.952 --> 09:35.160
My mum does.

09:36.955 --> 09:40.925
I lost my virginity
to this boy from Ghana.

09:40.959 --> 09:42.582
That's in Africa.

09:44.342 --> 09:46.896
He was the most beautiful man
I'd ever seen,

09:48.449 --> 09:50.900
apart from Robert Mitchum,

09:50.935 --> 09:52.937
but I'm not gonna
meet him in Wraysbury.

09:52.971 --> 09:54.628
[laughs]

09:56.285 --> 10:00.289
I don't think anyone would want
a read about all that
in the papers, do you?

10:02.843 --> 10:07.123
They would read about you
and... John Profumo, though.

10:07.952 --> 10:09.609
That'd shift a copy or two.

10:10.471 --> 10:12.232
How do you know
about me and Jack?

10:12.266 --> 10:14.683
You haven't exactly
kept it quiet, Chris.

10:16.892 --> 10:20.205
Innocent girl comes to London
looking for a better life,

10:20.240 --> 10:23.657
has her head turned
by a powerful but married man.

10:25.763 --> 10:27.247
It's a great story.

10:45.127 --> 10:48.061
-What about the pub?
-No, I can't. Too many people.

10:50.753 --> 10:52.341
-The zoo?
-[chuckles]

10:53.307 --> 10:55.102
I'm not your uncle, darling.

10:56.103 --> 10:58.174
There must be
somewhere we can go.

10:58.209 --> 11:00.798
Somewhere private...

11:06.182 --> 11:08.391
Would you like to see
where I work?

11:15.053 --> 11:17.262
I thought it would be
a bit more... posh.

11:17.297 --> 11:19.402
Hmm.

11:19.437 --> 11:22.854
Well, I suppose
this part of the building
has been neglected somewhat,

11:22.889 --> 11:25.374
but it is where all
the important stuff happens.

11:27.169 --> 11:30.931
Oh, can't show you in there
I'm afraid, top secret.

11:30.966 --> 11:36.074
This is where the typists sit,
in the week.

11:37.938 --> 11:39.560
I always fancied
learning to type.

11:39.595 --> 11:43.772
Shorthand typist,
you can always get a job.

11:45.014 --> 11:47.396
You're not in any danger
of unemployment, darling.

11:47.430 --> 11:51.331
No, but you need exams
to be a secretary.

11:56.957 --> 11:58.510
What if someone catches us?

12:02.135 --> 12:04.516
Oh, you like the idea
of getting caught?

12:06.864 --> 12:09.832
-Don't you?
-Yeah!

12:16.252 --> 12:18.323
[Christine]
Pleasure mixed with danger.

12:19.014 --> 12:21.257
I suppose
that's what Jack liked.

12:22.086 --> 12:23.950
Stephen was all for pleasure,

12:23.984 --> 12:26.815
but he didn't like
the idea of getting caught.

12:27.643 --> 12:29.507
Not one little bit.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.992
The reporter
you've been talking to,

12:33.269 --> 12:35.306
is he offering you
a lot of money?

12:36.617 --> 12:38.102
We haven't really...

12:40.173 --> 12:43.279
He says he'll stump up
for a story about Jack.

12:43.901 --> 12:45.143
Jack?

12:47.387 --> 12:49.009
I'm sure they will.

12:49.044 --> 12:51.287
But money isn't everything,
little baby.

12:52.910 --> 12:55.015
You never grew up without it.

13:07.407 --> 13:10.617
[Christine sighs]
Welcome to the shit hole.

13:14.863 --> 13:17.141
Lovely to see you again,
Stephen.

13:17.175 --> 13:19.177
-Hello.
-Always a pleasure.

13:21.110 --> 13:22.249
Chrissy.

13:27.668 --> 13:29.222
[sighs]

13:32.501 --> 13:35.642
-Darkies again!
-You can't say darkies, Mum.

13:35.676 --> 13:38.058
I can say what I like
in my own home.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.302
Isn't that right, Stephen?

13:40.336 --> 13:42.097
Indeed, Mrs. Huish.

13:42.131 --> 13:44.444
Julie, I've told you before!

13:45.548 --> 13:48.241
I'm so sorry I can't offer you
a cup of tea.

13:48.275 --> 13:50.312
Three days now,
since they cut us off.

13:51.416 --> 13:54.937
[Stephen] I've been telling
Christine she's fallen in
with the wrong crowd.

13:54.972 --> 13:56.421
The shooting was a warning.

13:57.250 --> 14:00.080
She's not a bad girl, Julie.
Far from it.

14:00.115 --> 14:03.394
I've always said
she's very special.

14:03.428 --> 14:05.672
Oh. She's something, anyway.

14:08.157 --> 14:10.677
They're saying it's six pounds
just to connect us back
to the gas.

14:12.437 --> 14:14.025
[Julie] I just hope
there's nothing more to come out

14:14.060 --> 14:16.476
about whatever
you've been up to, that's all!

14:17.166 --> 14:20.169
How do you think me and your dad
feel seeing your name
all over the papers?

14:20.204 --> 14:21.999
I'm not all over the--

14:22.033 --> 14:24.208
I had a crime
committed against me, Mum.

14:24.242 --> 14:26.693
-I could've been killed!
-You brought that on yourself.

14:26.727 --> 14:29.144
You know,
I always forget, Julie,

14:29.178 --> 14:31.525
how marvellously quiet
it is here.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.561
After London.

14:32.595 --> 14:34.494
[Julie] Believe you me,

14:34.528 --> 14:37.048
I'd swap it for a bit of noise
and life any day of the week.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.913
Nearly ten years, we've been
on the waiting list for a house.

14:39.948 --> 14:43.399
As I said to my husband,
it's not what you know,
it's who you know.

14:44.469 --> 14:46.920
[Christine gasping]

14:46.955 --> 14:49.509
[panting]

14:57.068 --> 15:01.245
[sobbing]

15:04.351 --> 15:07.285
[sobbing]

15:07.320 --> 15:08.424
[door opening]

15:13.119 --> 15:15.638
[Christine crying]

15:17.744 --> 15:19.435
[Julie] Jesus, Chrissie!

15:19.470 --> 15:21.161
What have you done?

15:22.611 --> 15:25.441
What did you do,
you silly little bitch?

15:28.272 --> 15:30.964
[crying]

15:35.417 --> 15:38.040
[Stephen] Onwards and upwards,
little baby.

15:40.767 --> 15:42.493
Life is good.

15:42.527 --> 15:44.115
Not in Wraysbury.

15:44.150 --> 15:45.323
[chuckles] Well, quite.

15:45.358 --> 15:46.635
-To London!
-[honking]

15:46.669 --> 15:48.637
[both laugh]

15:52.399 --> 15:55.713
This business with you
and the newspapers, and Jack.

15:57.404 --> 16:00.269
There are other considerations
apart from the money, you know.

16:03.065 --> 16:04.964
I thought you're
rather fond of him.

16:05.619 --> 16:07.035
He's alright.

16:09.175 --> 16:14.249
I don't suppose me and Jack
will be seeing each other again,
though, do you?

16:19.116 --> 16:21.463
Christine Keeler, who's she?

16:21.497 --> 16:26.330
Err, well, the newspapers know
exactly who she is, believe me.

16:26.364 --> 16:27.641
Mandy as well.

16:29.781 --> 16:33.199
They're buzzing
around the girls
like wasps round a jam pot.

16:33.233 --> 16:36.857
Surely you can steer them away
from speaking
to the press, Stephen.

16:36.892 --> 16:39.239
You have a great deal
of influence over them.

16:39.274 --> 16:43.381
Well, I like to think so,
but they do have minds
of their own, you know.

16:43.416 --> 16:45.107
Christine in particular.

16:45.142 --> 16:46.557
As you know, Jack.

16:48.904 --> 16:54.082
Which is why I thought it wise
for us to discuss the situation,

16:54.116 --> 16:56.256
now the spotlight
has fallen on her.

16:56.912 --> 16:59.604
I presume
it's a question of money.

17:00.881 --> 17:04.747
Uh... Not entirely, no.

17:04.782 --> 17:07.198
Chrissie's an odd girl, Jack,

17:07.233 --> 17:11.306
feels things much more deeply
than perhaps it appears.

17:11.340 --> 17:13.618
If you were to have
a word with her yourself,

17:13.653 --> 17:16.242
persuaded her against
selling herself so cheaply,

17:16.276 --> 17:18.382
it might go a long way.

17:18.416 --> 17:21.385
She's always spoken of you
quite warmly.

17:21.419 --> 17:24.250
Yes, well, I'd rather
she didn't speak of me at all!

17:24.284 --> 17:27.460
I have no time.
Look, Ward, it's impossible
for me to talk to Christine,

17:27.494 --> 17:30.187
surely you can see that.
It's risky enough
the three of us meeting.

17:31.705 --> 17:34.743
Money, however, can easily
be arranged, if need be.

17:34.777 --> 17:37.332
Just sort it out, would you?
There's a good chap.

17:37.366 --> 17:38.505
Bill.

17:38.540 --> 17:41.267
Absolutely, leave it with me.

17:42.268 --> 17:44.132
Good of you
to make the time, Jack!

18:57.274 --> 18:59.862
There are laws about that stuff,
you know, Christine.

18:59.897 --> 19:02.210
-It's getting out of hand.
-[Mandy] I've told her.

19:02.244 --> 19:05.420
At least open a window.
You know I can't abide
the smell.

19:05.454 --> 19:06.869
I need something for my nerves.

19:06.904 --> 19:09.458
The very moment
you wake up, apparently.

19:09.493 --> 19:11.357
Have you seen this?

19:11.391 --> 19:14.187
[Christine] Another bloody
letter from prison.

19:14.222 --> 19:17.294
I keep seeing Johnny's face
in that court room.

19:17.328 --> 19:19.572
Come on, little baby.
Deep breath in.

19:19.606 --> 19:20.676
[inhales]

19:20.711 --> 19:22.920
-And out...
-[exhales]

19:22.954 --> 19:24.508
And in...

19:24.542 --> 19:26.855
I'll have to go through it
all over again.

19:26.889 --> 19:28.960
-[doorbell]
-Oh!

19:28.995 --> 19:30.307
[whispering] It's the rozzers.

19:30.341 --> 19:31.998
[doorbell]

19:33.620 --> 19:35.588
Shit, it is! It's that sergeant!

19:35.622 --> 19:38.177
-From the shooting.
-[Mandy giggles]

19:46.978 --> 19:49.395
[Stephen] Can't remember
last time I saw a, a pistol.

19:49.429 --> 19:52.881
-[sergeant] Yeah.
-[Stephen] Must be very common
in your line of work, I assume.

19:53.502 --> 19:55.332
Or perhaps not.

19:56.436 --> 19:58.645
Very kind, ta.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.820
I was just saying
to your... landlord

20:00.854 --> 20:04.030
must have been horrible
for you girls to go
through all that.

20:04.064 --> 20:05.618
[giggles] Landlord.

20:05.652 --> 20:07.447
[laughs]

20:08.862 --> 20:10.623
[chuckling] Sugar?

20:10.657 --> 20:14.834
Er, no. Not allowed
the sweet stuff, thanks.

20:15.559 --> 20:17.837
Now, let's see, er...

20:17.871 --> 20:20.391
-Stephen Thomas Ward.
-Thank you.

20:20.426 --> 20:21.979
Marilyn Rice Davies.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.775
And Christine Margaret Keeler.

20:26.017 --> 20:28.641
-What's this?
-[sergeant] Oh, it's nothing
to worry about.

20:28.675 --> 20:32.334
Just binding you over
to appear as witnesses
at the Old Bailey trial.

20:32.955 --> 20:34.647
Crown versus John Edgecombe.

20:35.682 --> 20:37.684
I haven't got forty pounds.

20:37.719 --> 20:40.446
Then my advice would be
to turn up, Christine.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.620
Very sound, Detective Sergeant.

20:42.655 --> 20:44.691
Go on, little baby, sign.

20:50.766 --> 20:55.392
Yeah, well...
Just in case, this is me.

20:57.463 --> 21:01.674
Guns! I was saying to the lads,
you'd expect it in the Bronx.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.953
You were born in '44?

21:05.540 --> 21:08.025
I've a daughter your age.
You look older than 18.

21:08.059 --> 21:12.995
Cheek! It's my life experience,
Detective Sergeant.

21:13.030 --> 21:14.514
[giggles]

21:14.549 --> 21:16.102
Mandy, behave.

21:29.426 --> 21:31.945
Bail forms
for the Edgecombe trial.

21:32.843 --> 21:35.432
While we're at it,
can we see what we have on file

21:35.466 --> 21:37.537
for that Ward fella,
if anything?

21:37.572 --> 21:40.540
Doctor Stephen Ward. Osteopath.

21:40.575 --> 21:42.473
Seems an unorthodox
sort of fellow.

21:42.508 --> 21:44.475
-Will do, sir.
-Thanks, Doreen.

21:49.411 --> 21:52.518
[Christine]
It's pretty crazy, Paul,
seeing yourself in the news.

21:52.552 --> 21:54.416
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

21:54.451 --> 21:57.454
I'm telling you,
now's the time
to cash in, Chrissie.

21:57.488 --> 22:00.940
Stephen, I'm just saying
to Chrissie this is her moment.

22:00.974 --> 22:02.562
Now her name's out there.

22:03.563 --> 22:05.496
Chance to make
a bit of money for herself.

22:05.531 --> 22:07.809
Paul, how nice to see you.

22:08.603 --> 22:11.157
I was just talking about you
to a patient of mine,

22:11.191 --> 22:13.539
a rather interesting  vicomte.

22:13.573 --> 22:14.919
Oh, yeah?

22:14.954 --> 22:16.438
Hmm.

22:17.991 --> 22:21.063
Have you spoken to Michael,
little baby?

22:21.685 --> 22:22.789
[Christine] Not yet.

22:22.824 --> 22:24.032
[chuckles]

22:24.066 --> 22:26.379
[man] Stephen.

22:26.414 --> 22:28.657
Gordon Bennett,
your standards have slipped
a bit, haven't they, love?

22:28.692 --> 22:31.591
Can't all be as handsome
as you, can they, Paul?

22:33.110 --> 22:34.491
Serious, Christine.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.700
It's not just the papers.

22:36.734 --> 22:38.736
Modelling, articles,

22:38.771 --> 22:40.842
you need to strike
while the iron's hot.

22:41.567 --> 22:44.190
Stephen says it's better
to wait till Johnny's
trial's over, don't you?

22:44.224 --> 22:45.950
[door opening]

22:45.985 --> 22:48.781
Ah, Emil! I certainly do,
better to keep our powder dry.

22:48.815 --> 22:49.747
Dr. Ward!

22:50.990 --> 22:53.751
No disrespect to Stephen,
but he's talking
out of his arse.

22:53.786 --> 22:55.581
[Stephen] ...to Mandy.

22:55.615 --> 22:57.790
[Paul] It's all about
his own kinky little trip.

22:57.824 --> 22:59.723
His friends in high places.

22:59.757 --> 23:01.897
They'll be cacking it
that you'll name names,

23:01.932 --> 23:05.660
which might spoil their fun,
then where would he be?

23:05.694 --> 23:08.041
Fiddling with himself
on his lonesome.

23:08.076 --> 23:10.181
[both laugh]

23:10.216 --> 23:12.494
You need a manager, Chris.

23:12.529 --> 23:15.532
I've got tons of contacts,
Fleet Street, the lot.

23:16.187 --> 23:19.743
Of course, if you need
Uncle Stephen's permission...

23:19.777 --> 23:22.918
Piss off!
Stephen doesn't run my life.

23:22.953 --> 23:24.920
I think Christine
might need saving.

23:24.955 --> 23:26.612
Oh, good idea.

23:26.646 --> 23:28.407
Could have fooled me, doll.

23:33.929 --> 23:37.795
Is that chap some sort
of beat musician?

23:37.830 --> 23:41.661
Paul? Couldn't get a tune
out of a record player.

23:41.696 --> 23:42.835
What's his line?

23:42.869 --> 23:44.077
[Christine] All sorts.

23:44.112 --> 23:45.872
He's a proper wheeler dealer.

24:00.231 --> 24:03.787
One question,
how much does Christine
walk out of here with today?

24:03.821 --> 24:04.822
[Len] A hundred.

24:05.823 --> 24:07.791
-Ten percent of the final fee.
-[Paul] Two.

24:07.825 --> 24:09.655
Two hundred nicker today.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.590
Alright.

24:13.624 --> 24:15.833
And eight hundred
on publication.

24:15.868 --> 24:20.217
But how are you going to prove
to us Christine's story is true?

24:20.251 --> 24:21.598
Because it is.

24:22.944 --> 24:25.015
Because you've heard
a million rumours
about her and Profumo

24:25.049 --> 24:26.603
and there's no smoke
without fire.

24:28.294 --> 24:31.228
Do you want to explain
the libel courts to them, Alan?

24:32.850 --> 24:34.576
Mr. Profumo's a millionaire.

24:35.819 --> 24:39.616
If we print anything
that isn't true,

24:39.650 --> 24:41.549
he won't be afraid to sue.

24:42.308 --> 24:44.931
Sorry, Christine. Basically,
it's his word against yours

24:44.966 --> 24:46.864
that anything happened
between the two of you.

24:47.900 --> 24:48.970
But...

24:52.076 --> 24:53.906
I've got this.

25:15.686 --> 25:16.929
Good.

25:16.963 --> 25:18.344
[Len] Very good.

25:18.378 --> 25:20.726
We'll keep this here
for safekeeping.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.762
[Christine] Oh, I can't believe
how easy they just handed

25:22.797 --> 25:25.006
two hundred nicker over,
just like that.

25:26.697 --> 25:28.043
Fifty-fifty. As agreed.

25:29.079 --> 25:30.908
Bloody hell.

25:30.943 --> 25:33.877
Easiest hundred quid you'll
ever earn and more to come.

25:33.911 --> 25:36.914
"Christine Keeler, My Story."

25:36.949 --> 25:38.122
Can't wait to see it.

25:38.157 --> 25:39.538
[both laugh]

25:46.959 --> 25:52.102
[jazz music playing]

26:27.862 --> 26:29.001
Thanks.

26:31.072 --> 26:33.315
[chuckles]

26:34.662 --> 26:37.699
Paul's right,
this is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

26:37.734 --> 26:40.219
Modelling, adverts...

26:40.253 --> 26:42.462
There might even be
television work.

26:42.497 --> 26:46.812
You should be thinking
about elocution lessons,
you know, to talk properly.

26:47.364 --> 26:48.848
Christine! Concentrate.

26:48.883 --> 26:50.954
I am concentrating.

26:50.988 --> 26:54.026
-Can I have a slice
of that one please too?
-You'll get spots!

26:54.060 --> 26:55.199
Sod it.

26:55.234 --> 26:57.098
[laughs]

26:57.892 --> 27:00.860
You're 20, it's time
to think about the future.

27:00.895 --> 27:02.690
It's like me with Peter,

27:02.724 --> 27:04.450
well, not exactly,
'cos he set me up in the flat.

27:04.484 --> 27:06.072
But like I was saying to Alan,

27:06.107 --> 27:08.488
Christine does right,
where's Profumo now?

27:08.523 --> 27:10.387
Living it up in his mansion,

27:10.421 --> 27:12.113
not putting a ring
on her finger,
that's for certain.

27:12.147 --> 27:13.873
What?

27:13.908 --> 27:15.841
Profumo got what he wanted,
why should you go short?

27:15.875 --> 27:18.188
When were you talking to Alan?

27:22.123 --> 27:26.886
[Mandy and Christine arguing]

27:26.921 --> 27:31.373
[Mandy] I don't know why
you get so angry,
we were just talking.

27:31.408 --> 27:33.721
It's not your story to tell,
you gold digging little bitch.

27:33.755 --> 27:36.482
-It's got nothing
to do with you!
-Of course, it bloody does!

27:36.516 --> 27:39.140
This is you all over,
you've always
been jealous of me.

27:39.174 --> 27:41.142
You wish!

27:41.176 --> 27:42.902
Ever since Murray's,
you've always wanted
whatever I've got!

27:42.937 --> 27:44.421
You're the jealous one!
Now the papers are interested

27:44.455 --> 27:45.974
in my side of things
and you can't stand it!

27:46.009 --> 27:47.493
Come on,
let's all calm down, ladies.

27:47.527 --> 27:49.081
Yeah, they're really interested

27:49.115 --> 27:50.945
in you and your amazing
acting career.

27:50.979 --> 27:53.257
I'm more of an actress than
you'll ever be a model, love.

27:53.292 --> 27:56.398
Oi! Enough! The neighbours
have heard quite enough
recently, don't you think?

27:56.433 --> 27:58.193
Now, what's this all about?

27:59.816 --> 28:02.922
Little bitch has been talking
to the   Sunday Mirror
about me, and you.

28:02.957 --> 28:05.062
[Mandy] You're not the only one
who's got a story to tell.

28:05.097 --> 28:07.375
Anyway, why shouldn't I,
you already signed up.

28:07.409 --> 28:09.273
-[Stephen] For goodness' sake.
-What do you think you're doing?

28:09.308 --> 28:11.137
Everything I've ever lent you,
I want it back.

28:11.172 --> 28:13.450
-What do you mean, signed up?
-Leave my things alone, you cow!

28:13.484 --> 28:15.314
-Christine!
-Get off!

28:15.348 --> 28:17.454
This is serious,
you stupid little girl!

28:17.488 --> 28:19.767
-What have you said
to the papers?
-What business is it of yours?

28:19.801 --> 28:21.147
Let me go!

28:21.182 --> 28:22.977
If you can just calm down,
little baby,

28:23.011 --> 28:24.737
I am trying to act
in your best interest

28:24.772 --> 28:26.739
before, yet again, you do
something you come to regret!

28:26.774 --> 28:27.982
Fuck off, Stephen!

28:28.016 --> 28:29.466
It's my life!

28:29.500 --> 28:31.123
I'm not five years old!

28:31.157 --> 28:32.883
I'm not your fucking pet,

28:32.918 --> 28:35.817
to dress up and tell
what to do and who to screw!

28:37.508 --> 28:38.958
[door opening]

28:38.993 --> 28:40.546
I'm trying to help you,
little baby.

28:40.580 --> 28:42.099
[door closing]

28:44.515 --> 28:48.002
[sobbing]

28:54.974 --> 28:56.424
I can kip here
for a bit, can't I?

28:56.458 --> 28:59.910
Of course, you can, doll,
is everything alright?

28:59.945 --> 29:01.049
Yeah, it will be.

29:01.912 --> 29:03.534
You're staying for a bit then?

29:03.569 --> 29:07.504
Oh, sorry. I can help
with the rent and everything.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.299
I'm gonna be loaded!

29:09.333 --> 29:11.197
Err... Hello, Bill.

29:11.232 --> 29:13.475
[Bill]   Oh, Stephen.
Everything alright?

29:13.510 --> 29:16.858
Yes, I--I'm sorry
to trouble you so late.

29:16.893 --> 29:21.138
Erm, well,
there's no easy way to say this,

29:21.173 --> 29:25.591
Christine and Mandy have taken
a story to the   Sunday Mirror.

29:25.625 --> 29:27.179
Oh.

29:28.525 --> 29:31.045
Well, what did they say exactly?

29:31.079 --> 29:32.909
[Stephen]
Well, you can imagine.

29:33.633 --> 29:35.463
Life and loves...

29:35.497 --> 29:37.120
Right.

29:37.154 --> 29:39.467
Obviously, I'm taking care
of it this end,

29:39.501 --> 29:41.641
I--I just thought
that you should know.

29:41.676 --> 29:43.471
I see, well, err...

29:43.505 --> 29:45.991
Thank you, Stephen.
Very informative.

29:46.025 --> 29:47.578
Yes. Right.

29:47.613 --> 29:49.649
Let us, let us be in touch.

29:49.684 --> 29:51.065
Good night.

29:58.451 --> 29:59.798
[woman] Everything alright?

30:00.350 --> 30:02.490
-Should I play
your hand for you?
-Oh, err...

30:03.353 --> 30:05.182
Oh, it's--it's a silly thing.

30:05.217 --> 30:07.253
I need to make
a few telephone calls.

30:07.288 --> 30:08.841
Do, darling.

30:18.678 --> 30:19.956
Right you are.

30:21.095 --> 30:25.133
Well, perhaps we should seek,
er... legal advice.

30:26.134 --> 30:27.446
[Profumo] Alright, yes.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.897
Let's speak tomorrow.
Thanks, bye.

30:29.931 --> 30:31.415
Legal advice?

30:31.450 --> 30:35.454
Oh, it's just some, er...
tiresome triviality.

30:39.113 --> 30:42.357
[sighs] I really must finish
this wretched speech, darling.

30:43.358 --> 30:47.052
If you need an audience,
my love, practice run...

30:47.086 --> 30:48.950
I do know something
about the camera.

30:50.193 --> 30:52.126
What would I do without you?

31:13.009 --> 31:14.286
After you, Christine.

31:20.740 --> 31:24.434
[Alan] So, Christine,
when did the affair begin?

31:25.607 --> 31:28.162
You do understand,
Stephen, as a serving MP,

31:28.196 --> 31:30.612
any legal advice I can give
is strictly informal.

31:30.647 --> 31:33.236
-Completely understood.
-You won't take this
any further, old man?

31:33.270 --> 31:36.066
Oh, good God, no,
I'm like the grave!

31:39.449 --> 31:40.657
[man] Come in.

31:41.313 --> 31:43.246
[Davis] We're in a bit
of a difficulty.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.662
Concerning the Minister for War,

31:45.696 --> 31:48.285
have you heard that he...?

31:53.014 --> 31:55.361
-[knocks on the door]
-[man] Come in.

32:01.816 --> 32:05.337
Jack Profumo has had an affair.

32:05.371 --> 32:06.752
Shit...

32:06.786 --> 32:12.102
[indistinct chatter]

32:20.421 --> 32:23.010
Do excuse our chaos, John,

32:23.044 --> 32:25.115
our son goes back
to school tomorrow.

32:25.150 --> 32:27.324
Ah. Harrow, I presume?

32:27.359 --> 32:29.326
-Eton actually.
-Oh.

32:31.018 --> 32:33.572
[Hobson] Why Eton, Jock?
Why not the old place?

32:33.606 --> 32:36.299
[Profumo] Mark's Vee's boy
from her first marriage.

32:36.333 --> 32:39.405
I'll have my say
when David's old enough
to go to school.

32:40.544 --> 32:43.513
-I know this is
bloody terrible timing.
-It's abominable!

32:43.547 --> 32:46.688
We were up to our eyes
in spies and homosexuals,

32:46.723 --> 32:48.759
the press is baying for blood,

32:48.794 --> 32:51.417
the Prime Minister
is about as much good
as a eunuch in a brothel.

32:51.452 --> 32:54.317
Which is precisely why
the   Mirror 's trying to stir
the pot over me and this girl.

32:54.351 --> 32:55.835
They're really piling in!

32:55.870 --> 32:58.217
I'm inclined to agree,
make the PM look weak

32:58.252 --> 33:00.426
while knocking a viable
contender for the leadership.

33:01.738 --> 33:04.120
I'm flattered
you see me as such.

33:04.154 --> 33:05.604
Spare me your blushes, Jock.

33:05.638 --> 33:08.262
You know that the party
is looking to you.

33:09.228 --> 33:12.576
Which is why it's essential that
you're entirely frank with me.

33:12.611 --> 33:15.510
The Government
won't survive another scandal.

33:16.615 --> 33:19.549
Whatever has taken place
between you
and this bit of stuff--

33:19.583 --> 33:21.275
Nothing has!

33:22.345 --> 33:24.036
Absolutely nothing.

33:25.693 --> 33:29.317
I had a drink or two at Ward's,
the girl was there.

33:30.249 --> 33:32.079
I can't say I didn't look
But that's it.

33:33.666 --> 33:35.737
It seems to me,
that since this shooting,

33:35.772 --> 33:38.223
the poor creature
has seen a chance
to make a few bob for herself,

33:38.257 --> 33:40.501
and now the bloody   Mirror
is jumping on the bandwagon.

33:40.535 --> 33:43.400
And they won't rest
until a socialist government
is running the show,

33:43.435 --> 33:45.195
with their rag
as its national comic.

33:48.233 --> 33:49.372
John...

33:51.270 --> 33:53.514
you and I, we're grown
from the same soil,

33:53.548 --> 33:57.138
school to regiment, Harrow,
Brasenose, Northamptonshire--

33:57.173 --> 33:59.106
You have rather dogged
my footsteps.

33:59.140 --> 34:00.900
[chuckles]

34:00.935 --> 34:02.592
I give you my word.

34:03.696 --> 34:05.319
There was no affair.

34:26.926 --> 34:29.377
[Valerie] For God's sake, Jack,
come to bed!

34:31.793 --> 34:32.725
Coming.

34:43.564 --> 34:45.290
[Profumo sighs]

34:45.324 --> 34:46.636
What did John want?

34:47.775 --> 34:49.811
Are they getting rid of the PM?

34:50.985 --> 34:52.469
Not yet.

35:04.688 --> 35:06.518
[Profumo sighs]

35:17.529 --> 35:19.151
[Christine] Where are they?

35:19.186 --> 35:20.428
Hmm?

35:20.463 --> 35:21.567
Your family?

35:22.465 --> 35:24.950
Oh, Suffolk for a few days.

35:26.883 --> 35:27.780
The country.

35:29.437 --> 35:32.785
I can't stand the country.
It's boring.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.860
-Do you like it?
-Hmm.

35:40.448 --> 35:41.725
[sighs]

35:48.870 --> 35:50.286
What is it?

35:50.803 --> 35:53.599
-Eyelash.
-Is it expensive?

35:53.634 --> 35:56.602
No. But you wouldn't want
your wife finding it, would you?

35:56.637 --> 35:58.915
Darling, the housekeeper
will change the bed.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.917
What will the housekeeper think?

36:00.951 --> 36:03.368
Nothing. She's not paid
to think anything.

36:05.473 --> 36:06.612
[scrambler ringing]

36:06.647 --> 36:08.614
Oh, God

36:08.649 --> 36:11.548
-Is something wrong
with the phone?
-No, it's the scrambler.

36:11.583 --> 36:12.825
[sighs]

36:12.860 --> 36:14.793
The Prime Minister wants a word.

36:14.827 --> 36:16.864
[scrambler ringing]

36:19.453 --> 36:21.696
[scrambler ringing]

36:24.596 --> 36:26.805
[scrambler ringing]

36:27.806 --> 36:30.533
I do think you're right
to raise a concern, sir.

36:30.567 --> 36:33.674
It's a small weapon,
but if the Germans
are allowed to have it,

36:33.708 --> 36:37.988
then the Americans
are abdicating
a degree of control.

36:38.023 --> 36:41.475
[Profumo keeps speaking
in the background]

37:01.322 --> 37:02.254
[spraying]

37:12.989 --> 37:15.060
[Profumo] There's no question
they're using it

37:15.094 --> 37:17.269
for anything
other than self-defence.

37:17.304 --> 37:18.960
It's a short--Sorry, sir.

37:18.995 --> 37:22.378
Yes, it's a short-range system.

37:22.412 --> 37:24.380
Potential warhead.

37:28.522 --> 37:29.419
Yes, sir.

37:32.008 --> 37:33.112
[Christine]
I couldn't believe it.

37:33.147 --> 37:35.632
[Profumo] Yes, sir, no, no...

37:36.461 --> 37:38.635
Me in that beautiful house.

37:38.670 --> 37:41.776
You've come an awfully long way
from Wraysbury, Christine.

37:41.811 --> 37:42.777
Not half.

37:43.640 --> 37:44.917
[Len] Was it the baby...

37:45.987 --> 37:48.576
that made you leave home
and come to London?

37:49.750 --> 37:51.614
How do you know about that?

37:51.648 --> 37:53.892
Plenty of people
around Staines remember you.

37:53.926 --> 37:55.790
Why, what have they been saying?

37:55.825 --> 37:59.656
It can't have been easy for you.
Sixteen, pregnant.

37:59.691 --> 38:01.900
Everyone twitching the nets.

38:04.799 --> 38:06.939
It was like the end
of the world.

38:10.011 --> 38:11.461
I tried everything.

38:13.567 --> 38:16.811
Hot baths, gin.

38:18.399 --> 38:21.609
Castor oil, but that
just made me throw up...

38:25.095 --> 38:27.063
I used a pen in the end.

38:31.032 --> 38:33.414
[sobbing]

38:33.449 --> 38:36.866
[panting and sobbing]

38:38.074 --> 38:39.317
Stupid.

38:40.732 --> 38:42.492
They said I could have died.

38:45.426 --> 38:47.704
[trembling voice]
He lived six days in hospital.

38:48.809 --> 38:50.051
Peter.

38:55.505 --> 38:56.748
[sobs]

38:56.782 --> 38:58.681
Sweet sixteen, hey?

39:02.857 --> 39:04.445
[Alan] And the father?

39:04.480 --> 39:05.722
[sobs]

39:07.690 --> 39:09.726
Was it the beautiful chap
from Ghana?

39:11.245 --> 39:12.177
No.

39:13.143 --> 39:16.733
No, no! It was a local boy,
a boyfriend.

39:16.768 --> 39:19.357
I'm sure they'd love
to tell you different at home.

39:20.565 --> 39:23.430
You--You won't write it
was the other one, will you?

39:23.913 --> 39:27.019
You can't put in the paper
I had a black baby.

39:29.056 --> 39:30.747
It'd kill my mum!

39:36.822 --> 39:38.583
Too kind, Missus.

39:38.617 --> 39:40.516
Help yourself to sugar.

39:42.897 --> 39:46.384
I'm expecting Christine's dad
back from work.

39:46.936 --> 39:50.664
I was under the impression
Chrissie's dad had passed away,
Mrs. Huish.

39:50.698 --> 39:53.183
Ted. Her stepdad.

39:53.908 --> 39:56.221
She's always called him dad,
Mr. erm...

39:56.255 --> 39:59.017
Call me Lucky, everybody does.

39:59.673 --> 40:01.675
I don't want to hold you up.

40:06.507 --> 40:08.578
You've made it very cosy here.

40:09.579 --> 40:12.202
Christine never told me
it was so comfortable.

40:12.237 --> 40:14.446
Well, she's never liked it.

40:14.481 --> 40:16.931
-Got a taste
for the finer things.
-[chuckles]

40:16.966 --> 40:20.521
So true!
"A taste for the finer things."

40:21.488 --> 40:23.490
That's Christine, hmm.

40:25.492 --> 40:27.563
Where can I find her these days?

40:29.288 --> 40:31.739
[Julie]   It's alright for you
la-di-da-ing around London.

40:31.774 --> 40:34.604
Our name is dirt in Wraysbury.
I can't go anywhere.

40:34.639 --> 40:36.779
-I know.
-Now we've got darkies
turning up on the doorstep.

40:36.813 --> 40:40.161
-Mum! Mum!
-You said you'd speak
to someone.

40:40.196 --> 40:41.646
What do you expect me to do?

40:41.680 --> 40:43.268
It's probably in the newspapers.

40:43.302 --> 40:45.788
I don't know if Lucky
has gone to the newspapers!

40:45.822 --> 40:48.031
He'll say anything
if he thinks it'll get to me!

40:48.066 --> 40:50.758
I don't know,
you're bloody out
half the time--

40:50.793 --> 40:53.312
You haven't told him
where I'm staying, have you?

40:53.347 --> 40:55.107
Three days ago, I last rang.

40:55.142 --> 40:57.282
-I'm sorry.
-No, Christine.

40:57.316 --> 40:59.180
Yeah, I said I'm sorry,
alright?

40:59.215 --> 41:00.699
[slams the phone]

41:09.087 --> 41:11.261
[Mandy] What did Stephen
say to you on the phone?

41:12.297 --> 41:14.610
Just he wanted us
to make it up is all.

41:15.196 --> 41:16.922
One of his peace summits.

41:17.371 --> 41:19.684
"We're all in this together,
little baby."

41:20.374 --> 41:23.791
Don't listen to him, Chrissie.
I'm sick of it to be honest.

41:23.826 --> 41:25.206
You know what Stephen's like,

41:25.241 --> 41:27.761
he can always find
his way around you.

41:27.795 --> 41:30.729
It's like a snake charmer
or something.

41:30.764 --> 41:33.111
Don't let Stephen
change your mind!

41:33.145 --> 41:34.699
Why would I?

41:34.733 --> 41:36.942
The Mirror 's paying me
a fortune.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.982
Though I'm not sure
it's worth it, to be honest.

41:42.016 --> 41:45.779
They keep on asking
about me and Johnny,
me and Lucky.

41:46.400 --> 41:49.230
God knows what people
are gonna think
when the story comes out.

41:49.265 --> 41:51.267
Who bloody cares
what people think?

41:52.786 --> 41:56.203
You have no idea what it's like,
the names I get called.

41:57.825 --> 42:02.002
What about the girl at Murray's
with the thick ankles?

42:02.036 --> 42:03.624
-Tania?
-Tania.

42:03.659 --> 42:06.662
She used to jack
her tits up so far

42:06.696 --> 42:08.940
no one ever looked at her legs.

42:08.974 --> 42:10.804
Give 'em a better story
to print.

42:10.838 --> 42:13.220
What about all
the mucky parties?

42:13.254 --> 42:14.670
I've told them all that.

42:14.704 --> 42:16.568
-Cliveden, all the toffs?
-Mh-hm.

42:16.603 --> 42:19.916
That threesome that we did
with whatshisname oojamaflip?

42:19.951 --> 42:21.262
[sighs] Yeah.

42:23.851 --> 42:26.336
They keep on asking
if I've had it away with Eugene.

42:26.371 --> 42:29.063
There you are! Tania.

42:29.823 --> 42:33.240
If they're looking at... Eugene,

42:33.274 --> 42:37.037
they'll forget
all about... Lucky.

42:37.071 --> 42:38.866
[both laugh]

42:38.901 --> 42:40.281
Did you?

42:41.075 --> 42:43.699
We'd both had
so much to drink I'm not sure.

42:45.079 --> 42:47.737
Like trying to get a slug
in a slot machine.

42:47.772 --> 42:49.705
[both laugh]

42:51.189 --> 42:53.812
It's really boring
without you, you know.

42:54.364 --> 42:57.816
Why don't you come to Paula's?
She won't mind.

42:57.851 --> 42:59.197
The more the merrier.

42:59.956 --> 43:02.027
[laughs]

43:02.062 --> 43:04.720
Anyway, this thing
with the papers...

43:05.237 --> 43:07.895
You can't give the money
back now, Christine.

43:07.930 --> 43:11.381
I've spent it all.
And more besides.

43:13.418 --> 43:16.697
Just give 'em what they want!
All the juicy details.

43:20.459 --> 43:23.324
[Christine]
It was the same weekend
I met John Profumo.

43:24.291 --> 43:27.052
Me and Eugene
went through a couple
of bottles of whisky together.

43:27.087 --> 43:30.918
Hang on, you slept
with Ivanov at Cliveden?

43:31.436 --> 43:36.683
Ah, no, at Stephen's place.
Wimpole Mews.

43:37.753 --> 43:39.789
Eugene gave me a lift
back to London.

43:40.479 --> 43:42.171
No one else was around.

43:42.205 --> 43:46.278
So, the same day you met Profumo
at the pool at Cliveden--

43:46.313 --> 43:47.832
No, the Sunday.

43:47.866 --> 43:49.419
That's when they met
at the pool.

43:49.454 --> 43:51.939
Eugene and Jack, I mean.

43:51.974 --> 43:55.287
The swimming races
and what have you.
Mucking about.

43:56.495 --> 43:58.705
Eugene gave me a lift back,

43:59.740 --> 44:02.018
and like I say, whisky.

44:02.053 --> 44:04.918
-[laughs]
-One thing led to another and...

44:05.988 --> 44:08.853
Well, it's pretty hazy,
to be honest.

44:08.887 --> 44:10.820
Quite a weekend you had,
Chrissie.

44:10.855 --> 44:13.478
Profumo and Ivanov.
Two for the price of one!

44:13.512 --> 44:15.135
[all laugh]

44:16.515 --> 44:19.035
Well, it was just the one time.

44:20.934 --> 44:22.936
Maybe he was afraid
of getting caught.

44:23.350 --> 44:25.801
[ringing tone]

44:25.835 --> 44:28.355
[ringing tone]

44:28.389 --> 44:30.219
[woman]
Embassy of the Soviet Union.

44:30.253 --> 44:32.324
Yes, hello, thank goodness.

44:32.359 --> 44:34.741
I've been dialling
Captain Ivanov's extension
with no luck at all.

44:34.775 --> 44:37.744
We're meant
to be meeting for lunch
with Lord and Lady Addenhall.

44:37.778 --> 44:39.469
You wish to speak
to Captain Ivanov?

44:39.504 --> 44:41.402
Yes, that's right.
It's Dr. Stephen Ward here.

44:42.576 --> 44:44.785
-Hello?
-He is not here at present.

44:44.820 --> 44:47.823
Could you tell me,
is he going to be
in the embassy today?

44:47.857 --> 44:49.410
Maybe later.

44:49.445 --> 44:52.103
Wonderful. If you could
just give him the message.

44:52.137 --> 44:54.381
-From Ward, yes?
-Yes, thank you.

44:54.415 --> 44:57.004
-Eh... Goodbye.
-[hangs up]

45:04.115 --> 45:07.877
I didn't think about who was
in the flat when John
was coming round.

45:07.912 --> 45:10.017
It's just like that
at Stephen's.

45:10.052 --> 45:12.019
Free and easy.

45:12.054 --> 45:13.918
Was Ivanov there
when Profumo was there?

45:13.952 --> 45:15.816
-No.
-[Alan] You're sure about that?

45:16.886 --> 45:19.268
Er, they met in the hall
sort of thing.

45:20.131 --> 45:23.306
Eugene on his way out
as Jack was on his way in.

45:23.341 --> 45:25.861
Or the other way round.

45:25.895 --> 45:28.587
-Can I go for a wee now?
-In five minutes.

45:28.622 --> 45:31.314
Were there any questions
from Ivanov about Profumo,

45:31.349 --> 45:34.110
about you being so close
to the War Minister?

45:34.145 --> 45:36.009
I can't remember any.

45:40.254 --> 45:42.291
Stephen joked about it a bit,

45:43.050 --> 45:44.086
pillow talk.

45:44.569 --> 45:46.191
Like when, erm...

45:46.226 --> 45:49.298
Oh, what was going on
in Berlin a while back?

45:49.332 --> 45:51.438
When the wall went up?

45:51.472 --> 45:53.889
The Communists putting up
the wall that divided
West and East Berlin.

45:53.923 --> 45:55.960
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

45:55.994 --> 45:59.239
Around that time
there was a bit of joking.

45:59.273 --> 46:05.176
You know,
"Find out what's going on,
Eugene's dying to know."

46:06.073 --> 46:07.178
Teasing.

46:11.147 --> 46:12.977
Something about warheads.

46:16.359 --> 46:19.880
Yeah, Eugene asked about that.

46:19.915 --> 46:21.917
About warheads in Berlin?

46:21.951 --> 46:24.920
Yeah. Yeah, I think
that's what it was.

46:26.231 --> 46:31.409
"Ask Profumo when
they're putting warheads
in Berlin."

46:31.443 --> 46:34.446
[Len] And did you ask Profumo?

46:35.689 --> 46:37.553
Of course not!

46:40.073 --> 46:41.591
-It was a joke.
-A joke?

46:41.626 --> 46:44.422
-How did you know?
-'Cos he said it in a jokey way.

46:44.456 --> 46:46.079
Yeah, but that's
what Ivanov said.

46:47.390 --> 46:49.392
You're sure?

46:49.427 --> 46:54.018
"Ask Profumo when the West
is bringing warheads
into Berlin."

46:54.052 --> 46:55.329
Definitely.

46:57.159 --> 46:58.332
Something like that.

47:26.533 --> 47:29.398
There's been some developments
in the Keeler story.

47:30.744 --> 47:33.160
It'd definitely be worth
our while to meet.

47:44.137 --> 47:46.311
[knocking on the door]

47:54.112 --> 47:55.182
Darling.

47:56.011 --> 47:58.013
It's always open, you know that.

48:12.096 --> 48:14.063
Is Eugene a spy?

48:14.961 --> 48:17.170
Goodness. Can I make
a cup of coffee first?

48:17.204 --> 48:20.449
You're always joking about it,
Stephen. Is he?

48:22.175 --> 48:24.453
[laughing] Little baby...

48:25.178 --> 48:30.148
Anyone who works
for the Russian embassy
is a suspect, shall we say.

48:30.183 --> 48:33.082
That's always been
my operating assumption
with Eugene.

48:33.117 --> 48:34.773
The same as MI5's.

48:34.808 --> 48:36.120
Are you a spy?

48:40.020 --> 48:42.264
[laughs]

48:44.024 --> 48:47.994
Marijuana, little baby.
Paranoia is a symptom
of overuse.

48:48.028 --> 48:49.167
Give it a rest.

48:50.065 --> 48:51.411
All the people you know,

48:52.550 --> 48:54.345
everything you've got on them,
the parties,

48:54.379 --> 48:57.555
the envelopes you get me
to deliver, official business.

48:58.590 --> 49:00.558
Whose side are you on, Stephen?

49:04.113 --> 49:07.565
I think those newspaper men
have being dripping poison
in your ear.

49:08.773 --> 49:11.051
The world
is a complicated place,

49:11.086 --> 49:14.261
more complicated
than you can begin to imagine.

49:16.401 --> 49:17.782
Little baby...

49:18.783 --> 49:20.578
I'm on your side.

49:21.475 --> 49:23.063
That's all you need to know.

49:24.754 --> 49:28.586
You do know
we're on the same side.

49:34.212 --> 49:37.353
But it makes a good story
for the papers, I suppose.

49:37.388 --> 49:40.667
A Russian, spy games.

49:42.289 --> 49:44.498
But you mustn't
involve Jack in it.

49:45.465 --> 49:48.123
That would be
a terrible mistake.

49:48.157 --> 49:50.608
Why should I keep quiet
about Jack and me?

49:50.642 --> 49:52.679
-It happened!
-Of course it did.

49:52.713 --> 49:55.233
But that's not the way
the world works, Christine.

49:56.234 --> 49:59.755
A man as rich and powerful
as Jack Profumo,

49:59.789 --> 50:02.516
he can make
a world of trouble for you.

50:02.551 --> 50:08.177
There are other ways
to use the situation
to your advantage, little baby.

50:09.282 --> 50:10.455
Look at me.

50:13.113 --> 50:16.047
You can have a lovely life,

50:17.221 --> 50:18.808
you can tear it all up,

50:18.843 --> 50:21.708
fuck whoever you like,
any which way,

50:21.742 --> 50:24.745
as long as you stick
to the big rule.

50:26.609 --> 50:28.059
Don't tell.

50:29.647 --> 50:31.545
Don't cross that line.

50:33.927 --> 50:37.620
I've lived exactly the way
I've liked, and so can you.

50:41.107 --> 50:42.384
It's too late, though.

50:43.592 --> 50:45.180
I've told them everything.

50:46.388 --> 50:49.494
[sighs] You won't be
the first girl
who's lost her head

50:49.529 --> 50:52.049
over an offer to sell her story.

50:53.636 --> 50:56.639
Just tell them that you
exaggerated about Jack.

50:57.675 --> 50:59.573
That you embroidered the truth.

51:01.334 --> 51:03.267
What about his note, though?

51:03.301 --> 51:05.476
They're keeping it
in their safe.

51:07.443 --> 51:09.652
He calls me "darling" in it.

51:15.313 --> 51:18.144
[Profumo] For Christ's sake,
Ward, I can't remember
how many notes I sent her.

51:18.178 --> 51:20.732
Just shut it down.
I can't talk to you anymore!

51:20.767 --> 51:22.320
[hangs up]

51:29.327 --> 51:30.432
[knocks on the door]

51:30.466 --> 51:32.296
Er, one moment please!

51:32.330 --> 51:35.230
[dialling]

51:38.578 --> 51:40.269
[ringing tone]

51:40.304 --> 51:42.444
[telephone ringing]

51:43.169 --> 51:45.792
-Detective Sergeant Burrows.
-[Stephen]   Ah, Detective.

51:45.826 --> 51:47.863
It's Doctor Stephen Ward here.

51:49.244 --> 51:50.831
Do you have a moment?

51:51.591 --> 51:54.318
I was hoping we could have
a chat about Christine.

52:04.776 --> 52:05.777
Blue.

52:06.295 --> 52:07.503
If it's Constituents.

52:07.538 --> 52:09.229
It's Committee.

52:09.264 --> 52:10.506
Small mercies.

52:20.723 --> 52:23.140
Poor old you. You look done in.

52:24.382 --> 52:27.144
-Rakishly done in.
-Oh, thank you.

52:28.421 --> 52:30.768
I'm sorry if I've been
neglecting you, darling.

52:30.802 --> 52:33.288
It's all rather hands
on deck at the moment,

52:33.322 --> 52:35.290
disasters galore,

52:35.324 --> 52:37.878
the opposition feasting
like rats on a corpse.

52:37.913 --> 52:41.158
The PM isn't exactly providing
inspirational leadership.

52:41.882 --> 52:43.953
One feels one has to step up.

52:44.920 --> 52:47.854
Then virtue will be
its own reward.

52:48.648 --> 52:50.995
If not eventual leadership
of the party.

52:51.029 --> 52:52.479
Very Lady Macbeth.

52:52.514 --> 52:54.654
It's a hell of a part.

52:55.344 --> 52:56.725
[chuckles]

52:59.417 --> 53:00.901
If it's anything else, Jack...

53:00.936 --> 53:03.835
It isn't. I promise.

53:03.870 --> 53:05.734
Work's more than enough.

53:06.631 --> 53:08.392
Because I meant what I said.

53:09.082 --> 53:11.705
The last time
was the last time for me.

53:13.051 --> 53:14.432
I know.

53:15.571 --> 53:19.196
My darling... I promise.

53:29.585 --> 53:31.656
[sighs]

53:36.523 --> 53:37.697
Ah!

53:38.767 --> 53:42.288
âª And darling

53:42.909 --> 53:45.808
âª I love you

53:46.844 --> 53:51.745
âª I love you always

53:52.953 --> 53:55.059
âª But you've gone

53:55.093 --> 53:58.062
âª And left me

53:58.856 --> 54:01.755
âª For someone else

54:01.790 --> 54:03.240
[Lucky] Christine!

54:04.689 --> 54:06.519
Christine, me love, you know.

54:08.106 --> 54:10.557
Christina!

54:11.109 --> 54:13.008
How the hell
did he know I was here?

54:13.042 --> 54:15.873
[Lucky shouting]
Christine, you there?

54:16.908 --> 54:19.290
âª I love you

54:19.325 --> 54:23.536
Every time I think
I've got away, he turns up
and turns everything to shit.

54:23.570 --> 54:25.020
We know who gave him
the address...

54:25.054 --> 54:27.954
Er, hello, is that
Detective Sergeant Burrows?

54:27.988 --> 54:30.094
Yeah, it's Christine Keeler.

54:30.128 --> 54:31.992
-âª For someone else
-Stephen.

54:33.684 --> 54:35.686
[buzzer]

54:40.138 --> 54:42.106
You need to do something,
Mr. Burrows,

54:42.140 --> 54:43.694
before he gets a gun
like Johnny.

54:43.728 --> 54:45.489
I thought
I was bloody safe here.

54:45.523 --> 54:47.318
Well, there's no sign
of him now.

54:48.008 --> 54:50.735
We'll see if we can find him,
girls, have a word.

54:51.564 --> 54:52.668
Don't you worry.

54:55.878 --> 54:58.778
As a matter of fact, Christine,
Doctor Ward's been talking to us

54:58.812 --> 55:01.470
about your dependence
on cannabis.

55:02.057 --> 55:04.542
You sure Aloysius Gordon
wasn't here for a reason?

55:04.577 --> 55:07.027
I understand
he's a known cannabis user.

55:07.062 --> 55:09.754
What's Stephen on about?
Putting his oar in...

55:09.789 --> 55:11.653
He's concerned about Christine.

55:11.687 --> 55:13.896
Thought a chat
with one of officers
in the drugs squad

55:13.931 --> 55:15.519
might help straighten you out.

55:15.553 --> 55:18.176
He's full of it. Concern?

55:18.211 --> 55:21.559
Stephen's the one
that sent me to Notting Hill
in the first place to score pot.

55:21.594 --> 55:23.906
He's the only reason
I smoke the bloody stuff!

55:23.941 --> 55:26.875
[Mandy] She's right,
Stephen's into all sorts.

55:26.909 --> 55:29.498
He's the one that you
should be talking to, not us.

55:29.533 --> 55:32.467
Kinky sex, sex parties.

55:32.501 --> 55:33.744
We're young girls.

55:34.814 --> 55:36.505
That's what turns Stephen on,

55:36.540 --> 55:38.749
picking up girls and introducing
them to men and that.

55:38.783 --> 55:39.750
Really?

55:40.751 --> 55:42.891
He seemed very concerned
about your welfare.

55:42.925 --> 55:45.687
-You believe him and not me?
-That's not what I'm saying.

55:45.721 --> 55:48.828
Look, he introduced me
to John Profumo. The politician?

55:48.862 --> 55:51.071
And a spy, a Russian.

55:51.106 --> 55:54.040
He had me going
between them. Yeah.

55:54.074 --> 55:57.043
It's going to be
a really big story
in the   Sunday Mirror.

55:58.734 --> 56:02.945
Crikey. Well, that's quite
a different light on the matter.

56:06.777 --> 56:10.712
Would you be prepared
to make a statement
about all this, Christine?

56:15.061 --> 56:16.925
[Christine]
I was a naive little girl,

56:16.959 --> 56:18.927
with more power than I ever
could have dreamed of.

56:19.893 --> 56:22.413
-You smell like my mother.
-[laughs]

56:22.448 --> 56:25.451
[Christine]   But in the end,
it wasn't enough
to save any of us.

56:25.485 --> 56:28.902
Archie, will you get me
a direct line for Hollis?

56:29.903 --> 56:32.458
Yes, MI5!
What other Hollis is there?

56:34.563 --> 56:37.635
[Christine]   There were far  bigger powers at work, you see.

56:39.948 --> 56:43.607
The powers that really make
the world go round.

56:46.230 --> 56:49.026
And friendships you thought
would last forever

56:49.060 --> 56:52.616
just vanished into thin air.

57:01.107 --> 57:04.179
Stephen may have been
the puppet master...

57:04.213 --> 57:06.699
but he wasn't pulling
the strings anymore.

57:07.631 --> 57:09.529
Not mine, anyway.

57:13.809 --> 57:15.949
And the people who were...

57:18.158 --> 57:20.644
they were set to destroy us all.

57:23.785 --> 57:28.824
