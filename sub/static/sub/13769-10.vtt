WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.253
So apparently,

00:02.002 --> 00:03.253
there's a risk

00:03.295 --> 00:05.130
of extra blood loss

00:03.295 --> 00:05.130
with a cesarean section,

00:05.172 --> 00:08.759
but Dr. Howard is pretty sure

00:05.172 --> 00:08.759
I can deliver vaginally.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.051
He says I have

00:10.093 --> 00:11.345
a nice, thick placenta.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.347
What's a placenta?

00:13.388 --> 00:14.765
Don't tell him. God!

00:14.807 --> 00:17.058
Why are you boys

00:14.807 --> 00:17.058
being so squeamish?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.352
Come on, Mom.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.352
It's  gross!

00:18.393 --> 00:19.561
What are you

00:18.393 --> 00:19.561
talking about?

00:19.603 --> 00:20.688
You should

00:19.603 --> 00:20.688
be grateful.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.063
When you were in my womb,

00:22.105 --> 00:23.691
you were feeding off my placenta

00:22.105 --> 00:23.691
for nine months.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.025
Okay, that's it.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.906
I told you we only needed

00:28.111 --> 00:30.906
a medium.

Lois, you're not being fair.

Every year you tell me

01:11.613 --> 01:13.407
what you want for

01:11.613 --> 01:13.407
Valentine's Day-- every year.

01:13.448 --> 01:16.035
Now, this year you want me

01:13.448 --> 01:16.035
to buy you a present

01:16.076 --> 01:17.160
without so much as a clue?

01:17.202 --> 01:18.579
Can we discuss

01:17.202 --> 01:18.579
this later?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.039
When? After I've

01:18.620 --> 01:20.039
brought home

01:20.080 --> 01:21.122
a gift you hate

01:21.164 --> 01:22.332
that makes me

01:21.164 --> 01:22.332
look like a jackass

01:22.374 --> 01:23.584
and you never

01:22.374 --> 01:23.584
forgive me?

01:23.625 --> 01:24.919
Here, mint

01:23.625 --> 01:24.919
or original?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.628
I don't remember

01:24.960 --> 01:26.628
the morning sickness

01:26.670 --> 01:27.713
lasting this long.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.339
Well, you are

01:27.755 --> 01:29.339
a lot older.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.132
Honey, you know,

01:29.381 --> 01:31.132
like we all are.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.801
I mean, that's what happens--

01:31.174 --> 01:32.801
everyone gets older

01:32.843 --> 01:34.135
and older until

01:32.843 --> 01:34.135
they die...

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
and can we get

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
back to your gift?

01:36.179 --> 01:38.223
Hal, you're going to have at

01:36.179 --> 01:38.223
least four hours at the mall

01:38.265 --> 01:39.516
while I'm shopping

01:38.265 --> 01:39.516
with the boys.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.726
You'll find

01:39.558 --> 01:40.726
something.

01:40.768 --> 01:41.727
This isn't fair.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.728
You want to trade?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.063
You want to take

01:44.103 --> 01:45.814
three teenage boys

01:44.103 --> 01:45.814
to the basement sale

01:45.856 --> 01:47.608
at Hanning's

01:45.856 --> 01:47.608
and force them to try on

01:47.649 --> 01:49.192
a year's worth

01:47.649 --> 01:49.192
of school clothes?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.152
No, I'm good.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.154
Oh, God. My feet

01:51.194 --> 01:53.154
are so swollen,

01:53.196 --> 01:55.323
I'm going to need

01:53.196 --> 01:55.323
clown shoes.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.367
I can't believe I'm going

01:55.365 --> 01:57.367
through this again.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.995
So, a boy or a girl?

02:00.037 --> 02:01.162
What?

02:01.204 --> 02:02.414
Oh, come on--

02:01.204 --> 02:02.414
just between us,

02:02.456 --> 02:04.041
would you rather have

02:02.456 --> 02:04.041
a boy or a girl?

02:04.083 --> 02:05.584
Hal...

02:04.083 --> 02:05.584
Oh, I know, I know.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.336
"As long as it's healthy."

02:05.626 --> 02:08.336
We both know the drill.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.671
But deep down,

02:09.713 --> 02:11.799
you must want one

02:09.713 --> 02:11.799
more than the other.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.674
(sighs):

02:11.840 --> 02:12.674
Well...

02:12.716 --> 02:15.260
(crashing)

02:15.302 --> 02:17.638
I'll get

02:15.302 --> 02:17.638
the vacuum.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.973
(yelling)

02:19.014 --> 02:21.558
You broke my

02:19.014 --> 02:21.558
Space Fighter!

02:21.600 --> 02:23.184
Give it!

02:21.600 --> 02:23.184
You give it!

02:23.226 --> 02:24.979
What is going on here?

02:25.020 --> 02:25.646
He stole my pen!

02:25.687 --> 02:26.688
My favorite pen!

02:26.730 --> 02:28.273
Look at him

02:26.730 --> 02:28.273
holding it!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.109
Why is it  he  always

02:28.315 --> 02:30.109
gets the pen?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.069
I never get the pen!

02:32.111 --> 02:34.195
All I want is the pen!

02:34.237 --> 02:35.572
What is wrong with you boys?

02:35.614 --> 02:37.992
You have a whole drawer

02:35.614 --> 02:37.992
full of pens right here.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.409
Why does he

02:38.033 --> 02:39.409
have to have

02:39.451 --> 02:41.787
everything I want?!

02:39.451 --> 02:41.787
I never have what I need!

02:41.829 --> 02:43.204
I don't even have

02:41.829 --> 02:43.204
my own bed!

02:43.246 --> 02:44.205
Why does everything

02:44.247 --> 02:45.415
in my life suck?!

02:45.457 --> 02:47.793
You owe me a new Space Fighter!

02:47.835 --> 02:49.128
Shut up and get your own pen!

02:49.168 --> 02:50.295
(yelling)

02:51.254 --> 02:53.799
Give it to me!

02:53.841 --> 02:55.216
Give it to me!

02:55.258 --> 02:56.969
(boys yelling)

02:59.138 --> 03:00.430
Renee, please

02:59.138 --> 03:00.430
don't touch it.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.599
Mallory, you're being silly.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.599
It's just a pen.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.225
I was going to do

03:02.641 --> 03:04.225
homework with it.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.145
Unless there's

03:04.267 --> 03:06.145
a reason

03:06.185 --> 03:08.271
this pen's

03:06.185 --> 03:08.271
important to you.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.273
It's stupid.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.316
No, it isn't,

03:10.315 --> 03:11.316
Mallory.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.400
You can tell her.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.902
Daisy's right.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.902
You can tell me.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.696
How come you never say

03:13.944 --> 03:15.696
what's on your mind?

03:15.737 --> 03:18.949
DAISY:

03:15.737 --> 03:18.949
Yeah, you're always so quiet.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.538
MALLORY:

03:23.286 --> 03:24.538
Well...

03:24.579 --> 03:28.416
this boy dropped it

03:24.579 --> 03:28.416
in biology class.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.960
He chewed on

03:28.458 --> 03:29.960
it a little.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.170
Oh, I am so sorry.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.629
I should have known that.

03:32.671 --> 03:33.755
I hate being dumb.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.340
If I didn't grow

03:33.797 --> 03:35.340
such great hair,

03:35.382 --> 03:36.758
my head would be useless.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.468
You don't have

03:36.800 --> 03:38.468
to be a genius.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.261
You're sweet

03:38.510 --> 03:40.261
and thoughtful...

03:40.303 --> 03:41.680
and that's

03:40.303 --> 03:41.680
what counts.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.723
Aw.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.265
DAISY:

03:42.764 --> 03:44.265
Wow.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.144
That was the worst fight

03:44.307 --> 03:47.144
we've had in  months.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.269
(giggling)

03:48.311 --> 03:51.272
Why don't you just  die?!

03:51.314 --> 03:52.983
Give me my pen!

03:51.314 --> 03:52.983
I'm warning you...

03:53.025 --> 03:54.068
Ooh, I'm scared.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.235
What are you gonna do?

03:56.111 --> 03:57.362
What's the baby

03:56.111 --> 03:57.362
gonna do?

03:57.404 --> 03:58.446
(grunts)

03:58.488 --> 03:59.406
Malcolm!

04:02.784 --> 04:05.787
Malcolm, you can

04:02.784 --> 04:05.787
take Reese?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.497
No one's "taking" anybody.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.874
I can't believe

04:07.539 --> 04:08.874
you boys.

04:08.916 --> 04:09.917
(groaning)

04:09.958 --> 04:12.293
Oh, my God, look at you!

04:12.335 --> 04:15.338
He'd better not need stitches.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.715
(groans)

04:16.757 --> 04:18.466
Yeah, like you

04:16.757 --> 04:18.466
weren't begging for it.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.342
(groans)

04:19.384 --> 04:20.928
LOIS:

04:19.384 --> 04:20.928
Come on!

04:20.969 --> 04:22.721
We got a lot of shopping to do!

04:22.763 --> 04:24.305
(phone rings)

04:24.347 --> 04:25.557
Hello.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.308
Mom! Great!

04:25.599 --> 04:27.308
Listen, I need a favor.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.936
I need you to go in the garage.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.479
Under the paint tarps,

04:28.977 --> 04:31.479
next to the rat poison,

04:31.521 --> 04:34.315
is my old box of  Mad Magazines,

04:31.521 --> 04:34.315
and the one I need you to find

04:34.357 --> 04:35.358
is in the middle stack.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.236
Francis,

04:35.400 --> 04:37.236
what are you talking about?

04:37.277 --> 04:40.488
I got a $20 bet on whether

04:37.277 --> 04:40.488
the cover is "Stagnum P.I."

04:40.530 --> 04:41.782
or "Magnum P.U."

04:41.823 --> 04:44.201
Francis,

04:41.823 --> 04:44.201
I don't have time for this.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.119
Oh, of course you don't

04:45.160 --> 04:46.327
'cause every time

04:46.369 --> 04:47.871
something important

04:46.369 --> 04:47.871
to me comes up...

04:51.374 --> 04:53.919
(groans)

04:53.961 --> 04:55.503
Will you hurry up?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.257
We're going to have park,

04:55.545 --> 04:58.257
like, a mile away!

04:58.298 --> 04:59.549
Why do we have

04:58.298 --> 04:59.549
to go shopping, anyway?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.342
Because you ruin

04:59.591 --> 05:01.342
everything you own.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.012
New clothes don't just magically

05:01.384 --> 05:04.012
appear in your drawers.

05:04.054 --> 05:04.888
Mine do.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.269
(beeping horn)

05:10.310 --> 05:12.146
Hal, hurry up!

05:12.187 --> 05:13.939
Why can't you go

05:12.187 --> 05:13.939
shopping without us?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.607
I'm a medium,

05:13.981 --> 05:15.607
I like blue.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.607
Go crazy.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.858
Seriously, Mom,

05:15.649 --> 05:16.858
think about it--

05:16.900 --> 05:17.859
you're dragging

05:16.900 --> 05:17.859
us to a place

05:17.901 --> 05:19.069
that we don't like,

05:19.111 --> 05:20.361
to buy clothes

05:19.111 --> 05:20.361
we don't care about,

05:20.403 --> 05:21.822
for money you

05:20.403 --> 05:21.822
don't want to spend,

05:21.863 --> 05:23.364
to look nice for

05:21.863 --> 05:23.364
people who hate

05:21.863 --> 05:23.364
our guts.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.283
MALLORY:

05:23.406 --> 05:24.283
And if we go

05:23.406 --> 05:24.283
to the shoe store

05:24.324 --> 05:25.408
before we look

05:24.324 --> 05:25.408
for jeans,

05:25.450 --> 05:26.952
we can get yogurt

05:25.450 --> 05:26.952
in between.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.369
Mom, will you help me

05:26.994 --> 05:28.369
pick out earrings?

05:28.411 --> 05:30.080
No, she's gonna help me

05:28.411 --> 05:30.080
pick out tops.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.206
You know what

05:30.122 --> 05:31.206
we should do?

05:31.248 --> 05:32.373
You two take

05:31.248 --> 05:32.373
the first floor,

05:32.415 --> 05:33.625
and we'll take

05:32.415 --> 05:33.625
the second floor,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.002
and we'll meet

05:33.667 --> 05:35.002
every 45 minutes

05:35.043 --> 05:36.377
at the pretzel place

05:35.043 --> 05:36.377
and see what else

05:36.419 --> 05:37.462
we need to get,

05:36.419 --> 05:37.462
and then...

05:37.504 --> 05:38.379
Girls, girls,

05:38.421 --> 05:39.589
calm down.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.382
We do this, like,

05:39.631 --> 05:41.382
five times a week.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.051
You think you'd be bored by now.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.886
I know why Mallory wants to meet

05:43.093 --> 05:44.886
at the pretzel place.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.096
That's where Jason McNeil works.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.388
Daisy!

05:47.430 --> 05:48.974
That's  who you have

05:47.430 --> 05:48.974
a crush on? Jason?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.767
Maybe.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.767
Mallory, he has

05:49.016 --> 05:50.767
a mustache.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.477
You don't want

05:50.809 --> 05:52.477
anything to do

05:52.519 --> 05:53.687
with a boy like that.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.438
You're always so

05:53.728 --> 05:55.438
protective of me.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.481
Come on, Daddy, hurry.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.608
Dad, come on, the

05:56.523 --> 05:58.608
mall is calling!

05:58.650 --> 06:00.986
(all shouting)

06:01.028 --> 06:02.403
Damn it. That's enough!

06:02.445 --> 06:04.698
Now, we are going shopping,

06:02.445 --> 06:04.698
and that is it!

06:04.739 --> 06:06.407
(all complaining at once)

06:06.449 --> 06:08.202
I don't even need

06:06.449 --> 06:08.202
new clothes!

06:08.243 --> 06:09.828
I don't even want

06:08.243 --> 06:09.828
to go the mall!

06:09.870 --> 06:11.412
Do you want big,

06:09.870 --> 06:11.412
do you want small?

06:11.454 --> 06:12.413
Do you want for you?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.414
Do you want

06:12.455 --> 06:13.414
for the house?

06:13.456 --> 06:14.415
Do you want

06:13.456 --> 06:14.415
sincere...?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.335
Hal, you know what I like.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.586
Yes, because

06:16.375 --> 06:18.586
you've always told me!

06:18.628 --> 06:20.630
For the past five

06:18.628 --> 06:20.630
Valentine's Days,

06:20.672 --> 06:22.423
you've asked

06:20.672 --> 06:22.423
for a lawn mower,

06:22.465 --> 06:24.592
bath salts, earrings,

06:22.465 --> 06:24.592
a Hibachi,

06:24.634 --> 06:25.593
a porcelain cat.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.428
Th-There's no pattern, Lois.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.429
It is madness!

06:28.471 --> 06:30.057
I'm telling you,

06:28.471 --> 06:30.057
it's madness!

06:30.098 --> 06:32.309
Okay, I'm going to let

06:30.098 --> 06:32.309
you do this to yourself.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.810
My feet are killing me.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.146
We're going to hit the

06:33.852 --> 06:36.146
food court before the sale.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.481
Fine! Be that way!

06:38.523 --> 06:40.108
Don't come crying to me

06:40.150 --> 06:42.944
when you end up with a pair

06:40.150 --> 06:42.944
of puppy oven mitts!

06:44.946 --> 06:48.283
Do you like puppy oven mitts?!

06:50.493 --> 06:52.453
One salad with light dressing

06:52.495 --> 06:54.497
and three grande

06:52.495 --> 06:54.497
chili stampedes--

06:54.539 --> 06:56.083
one with extra onions,

06:56.124 --> 06:58.459
one with extra beans

06:56.124 --> 06:58.459
and extra onions,

06:58.501 --> 07:02.463
and one with extra beans

06:58.501 --> 07:02.463
and extra, extra onions.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.174
You've shot down

07:02.505 --> 07:04.174
my star-pod

07:04.216 --> 07:06.467
for the last time, Zoltan.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.969
What you gonna do?

07:08.011 --> 07:10.555
What's the baby gonna do, huh?

07:10.597 --> 07:12.473
Aah! My lip!

07:12.515 --> 07:14.351
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

07:14.393 --> 07:16.436
It hurts!

07:21.441 --> 07:23.651
I don't want

07:21.441 --> 07:23.651
a hat, Hal.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.153
Damn.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.072
Okay, if one of you boys

07:25.195 --> 07:27.072
wants to get napkins,

07:27.114 --> 07:28.448
we can start...

07:33.036 --> 07:34.704
Boy, keep the windows

07:33.036 --> 07:34.704
open tonight,

07:34.746 --> 07:35.705
'cause I'm gonna rip

07:35.747 --> 07:36.957
the biggest...

07:36.998 --> 07:38.792
DAISY: ...hole in

07:36.998 --> 07:38.792
my sweater.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.127
Look at this.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.586
I think I snagged it

07:40.168 --> 07:41.586
on something.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.504
I hate when

07:41.628 --> 07:43.504
I ruin my things.

07:43.546 --> 07:47.175
Remember when I was two

07:43.546 --> 07:47.175
and I got cake on my jumper?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.135
Don't worry.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.510
I snagged a

07:48.176 --> 07:49.510
blouse once.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.012
That's when Mom

07:49.552 --> 07:51.012
taught me how to sew.

07:51.054 --> 07:51.888
Why isn't Daddy back

07:51.930 --> 07:53.307
from the pharmacy yet?

07:53.348 --> 07:54.766
I'll bet he's

07:53.348 --> 07:54.766
sneaking a cigarette.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.976
Now, you girls let him be.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.518
Sometimes he just needs a break.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.397
It's not easy being

07:57.560 --> 08:00.397
the only boy in the family.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.773
Oh, look.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.193
Hi, honey,

08:03.275 --> 08:05.193
we're over here.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.153
Hi, Daddy.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.446
Hi, Daddy.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.822
Hi, girls.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.822
Sorry it took so long.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.782
No one's upset with me,

08:08.863 --> 08:10.782
are they?

08:11.741 --> 08:14.244
Bought everyone some cookies.

08:14.286 --> 08:17.038
Oh... they're gone.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.166
Daddy, you know

08:17.080 --> 08:19.166
how you like

08:19.207 --> 08:20.334
to make me happy?

08:20.375 --> 08:22.543
(whimpers):

08:20.375 --> 08:22.543
Yes?

08:22.585 --> 08:23.920
Well, there

08:22.585 --> 08:23.920
is the cutest

08:23.962 --> 08:25.255
little makeup kit at

08:23.962 --> 08:25.255
the Clinique counter.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.547
Oh, honey, no.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.425
Now, absolutely not.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.385
I don't even like

08:30.427 --> 08:31.552
you wearing makeup,

08:31.594 --> 08:32.762
and that stuff

08:31.594 --> 08:32.762
is so overpriced.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.431
And what's

08:32.804 --> 08:34.431
such a hurry... ?

08:34.473 --> 08:35.932
Hal, it's all right.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.143
Mallory, stop manipulating

08:35.974 --> 08:38.143
your father.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.560
You know there's no sport in it.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.438
She wants to look pretty

08:39.602 --> 08:41.438
for Jason.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.481
Who's Jason?

08:42.563 --> 08:43.564
Daddy, keep

08:42.563 --> 08:43.564
your voice down.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.565
He's right over there.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.651
God, I can't

08:44.607 --> 08:46.651
believe you.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.196
I don't know what

08:46.693 --> 08:49.196
you see in that guy.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.405
Daddy, don't you think

08:50.447 --> 08:51.614
Mallory should be

08:50.447 --> 08:51.614
with someone else?

08:51.656 --> 08:53.200
No.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.200
Well, that's easy

08:51.656 --> 08:53.200
for you to say.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.617
You have, like,

08:53.241 --> 08:54.617
50 guys after you.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.618
50?!

08:55.660 --> 08:58.288
(coughing)

08:59.622 --> 09:01.958
All right, girls,

08:59.622 --> 09:01.958
that's enough.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.419
Now, Renee, I know

09:02.000 --> 09:04.419
you love your sister,

09:04.461 --> 09:06.587
but you can't live

09:04.461 --> 09:06.587
her life for her.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.215
And, Mallory,

09:08.256 --> 09:10.300
I know you want to look older

09:08.256 --> 09:10.300
and more sophisticated,

09:10.342 --> 09:11.843
but trust me...

09:11.885 --> 09:14.595
that three-dollar lip gloss

09:11.885 --> 09:14.595
is working just fine.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.972
You're right, Mom.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.598
You're  always  right.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.600
DEWEY: Hey, I was

09:17.640 --> 09:19.600
gonna eat that!

09:19.642 --> 09:20.894
REESE:

09:19.642 --> 09:20.894
Tough luck!

09:20.935 --> 09:22.603
MALCOLM:

09:20.935 --> 09:22.603
What the hell's wrong with you?!

09:22.645 --> 09:23.688
(boys continue arguing)

09:33.281 --> 09:34.491
No.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.911
Damn.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.163
Can I help you?

09:44.959 --> 09:46.627
Don't do it.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.255
Thank you.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.840
All right,

09:49.172 --> 09:50.840
we're going in.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.009
You see anything in your size,

09:50.882 --> 09:53.009
grab it and hold on to it,

09:53.051 --> 09:55.011
no matter what anyone

09:53.051 --> 09:55.011
tries to do to you.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.930
Protect your heads.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.930
Don't trust anyone.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.639
What are you trying to do,

09:56.971 --> 09:58.639
scare us?

09:58.681 --> 09:59.682
Yes. Fear is good.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.226
It's an 80%-off sale.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.270
Fear will keep you alive.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.190
Don't worry.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.190
We're with Malcolm.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.862
Ooh.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.614
Oh...

10:16.616 --> 10:19.494
Oh, the foot spa.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.494
Those are good, right?

10:19.536 --> 10:20.537
Oh, yeah, they're amazing.

10:20.579 --> 10:21.662
I already have two.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.123
This one's for

10:21.704 --> 10:23.123
my downstairs bathroom.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.874
Well, enjoy.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.544
I would like the deluxe foot spa

10:24.916 --> 10:27.544
with remote control,

10:27.586 --> 10:29.670
and I'd like it gift-wrapped,

10:27.586 --> 10:29.670
please.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.506
I'm sorry.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.506
That was our last one.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.717
No! Well, what about

10:31.548 --> 10:34.717
the one in the window?

10:34.759 --> 10:37.137
It's a display model.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.137
It's just a shell.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.473
But you have to...

10:39.514 --> 10:42.142
I need the... the perfect...

10:42.183 --> 10:44.185
My wife...

10:44.227 --> 10:46.646
Sir! Sir!

10:47.772 --> 10:48.689
(chuckles)

10:48.731 --> 10:49.774
Excuse me. Hi.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.067
I'm Hal, remember?

10:51.109 --> 10:52.693
Your friend from

10:51.109 --> 10:52.693
just now in the store.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.279
Yeah, hi.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.279
Hi.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.697
I was trying to get one of

10:54.321 --> 10:56.697
those foot spas for my wife.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.991
Oh, really?

10:58.032 --> 10:59.909
Yeah, my pregnant wife.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.287
For Valentine's Day, you know.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.998
And apparently,

11:02.329 --> 11:04.998
you bought the last one.

11:05.039 --> 11:08.502
So, I was wondering,

11:05.039 --> 11:08.502
since you already have two,

11:08.543 --> 11:11.546
uh, if you wouldn't mind

11:08.543 --> 11:11.546
selling me that one.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.715
No, I don't

11:11.588 --> 11:14.715
think so. Sorry.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.134
Look, you don't understand.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.553
I have been searching

11:16.176 --> 11:18.553
and searching.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.305
I'll give you double

11:18.595 --> 11:20.305
what you paid for.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.516
No! I'll give you triple.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.724
Look, I'm sorry, but no.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.101
This is mine. I bought it.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.727
I'm sure if you just

11:25.143 --> 11:26.727
keep looking around,

11:26.769 --> 11:27.728
you'll find something else.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.772
Oh, okay, okay.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.859
Um, ah, how about this?

11:36.695 --> 11:38.739
(grunting)

11:48.667 --> 11:51.044
(yelping)

12:01.638 --> 12:04.723
(panting)

12:05.808 --> 12:06.934
(gasping)

12:06.976 --> 12:08.603
(screams)

12:11.398 --> 12:14.775
(clamoring)

12:19.280 --> 12:21.366
I can see through

12:19.280 --> 12:21.366
that old lady's bra.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.785
We've got to get out of here

12:21.408 --> 12:24.785
before we're scarred for life.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.329
Come on.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.290
Hey, Mom, we've...

12:29.332 --> 12:30.875
You did not already

12:29.332 --> 12:30.875
try on those clothes.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.420
And you do not have a term

12:30.917 --> 12:33.420
paper due, and you are not

12:33.461 --> 12:35.004
going to suddenly

12:33.461 --> 12:35.004
develop stomach cramps.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.715
How did you...?

12:35.046 --> 12:36.715
Please, who do you think

12:36.755 --> 12:37.798
you're talking to?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.800
Now, go, try on

12:37.840 --> 12:39.800
those clothes.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.010
Reese.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.470
Takes these and go

12:41.052 --> 12:42.470
with your brother.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.722
Mom, what are you doing?

12:43.762 --> 12:45.515
Why are you giving me

12:43.762 --> 12:45.515
a pink shirt?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.183
I don't wear pink.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.183
I've never worn pink.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.809
That shirt is red.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.811
If you have something to say,

12:48.851 --> 12:50.811
just come out and say it.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.230
(sighs)

12:52.272 --> 12:54.441
For the love of God,

12:52.272 --> 12:54.441
I'll find you another one.

12:56.568 --> 12:57.776
Excuse me.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.114
Wow, what happened to your face?

13:01.155 --> 13:02.699
I slept on it wrong.

13:02.741 --> 13:03.824
What do you mean?

13:03.866 --> 13:05.702
Well, I'm sleeping like this,

13:05.744 --> 13:07.621
and then my knee went

13:05.744 --> 13:07.621
up into my elbow,

13:07.662 --> 13:09.830
and my elbow hit my hand

13:07.662 --> 13:09.830
and it went in my mouth,

13:09.872 --> 13:11.832
and no one hit me, okay?

13:11.874 --> 13:14.419
I don't want to hear

13:11.874 --> 13:14.419
any more of your whining.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.795
You try this on right now,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.795
understood?!

13:23.511 --> 13:24.887
LOIS: Why are you

13:23.511 --> 13:24.887
standing here?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.556
You're wasting time.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.224
I'm not changing out here

13:26.598 --> 13:28.224
in front of everybody.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.268
You know what?

13:28.266 --> 13:30.268
I don't even need new clothes.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.019
I'll just live off the lost

13:30.310 --> 13:32.019
and found at school.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.438
It's all better

13:32.061 --> 13:33.438
than this crap anyway.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.107
MALLORY: Mom, Mom,

13:33.480 --> 13:36.107
there you are.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.068
Look, it's a $200 dress

13:36.149 --> 13:39.068
they marked down to $30.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.779
Oh, my God.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.779
This is like a dream.

13:40.819 --> 13:41.904
Mom, you will not

13:40.819 --> 13:41.904
believe this.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.740
I had Daisy

13:41.946 --> 13:43.740
dig through the cabinets

13:43.782 --> 13:45.700
under the sales table,

13:43.782 --> 13:45.700
and we found all this stuff

13:45.742 --> 13:47.535
they were saving to put out

13:45.742 --> 13:47.535
for tomorrow.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.912
Yeah, we've got all the clothes

13:47.577 --> 13:49.912
we need for the whole year.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.372
Good work, girls.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.832
Uh-oh, look who's here.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.173
You know, I wouldn't

13:58.630 --> 14:00.173
be insulted if you wanted

14:00.214 --> 14:01.382
to go for an ice cream

14:00.214 --> 14:01.382
with him.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.509
Maybe later.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.051
This is our

14:02.550 --> 14:04.051
special day, Mom.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.387
Yeah, and we haven't even gotten

14:04.093 --> 14:06.387
to the best part yet.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.139
When we help find things

14:06.429 --> 14:08.139
for  you.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.685
I can't really describe him.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.561
He was just

14:11.726 --> 14:13.561
an average-looking guy,

14:13.603 --> 14:15.146
but he had

14:13.603 --> 14:15.146
kind of crazy eyes.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.105
Is that helpful?

14:16.147 --> 14:18.065
Sir, I'm so sorry.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.318
I don't know what

14:18.107 --> 14:20.318
came over me earlier.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.069
I'm really not

14:20.360 --> 14:22.069
that kind of person.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.824
I-I just think it was all

14:22.111 --> 14:25.824
the pressure of Valentine's Day,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.909
and I was so upset

14:25.865 --> 14:28.909
and irrational.

14:28.951 --> 14:33.289
But the bottom line is

14:28.951 --> 14:33.289
that I made a mistake and...

14:33.331 --> 14:35.667
grabbed the wrong bag!

14:37.960 --> 14:40.880
(yelping)

14:47.136 --> 14:49.055
(yelling)

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
(sobbing)

14:54.268 --> 14:56.187
Oh, God...

15:06.656 --> 15:08.867
(panting)

15:14.706 --> 15:16.290
(screaming)

15:22.881 --> 15:24.924
(clamoring)

15:29.512 --> 15:31.222
Look at him.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.222
Yeah.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.892
I assume you'll want

15:31.264 --> 15:33.892
the same deal I had with him.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.226
What are you

15:33.933 --> 15:35.226
talking about?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.394
Look, Reese is as good

15:36.436 --> 15:38.772
as dead, at least

15:36.436 --> 15:38.772
on the inside.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.273
That puts you in charge.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.608
You get half my candy,

15:41.649 --> 15:42.983
full control of the remote,

15:43.025 --> 15:44.694
and since I can't do

15:43.025 --> 15:44.694
your  homework for you,

15:44.736 --> 15:45.986
how about a nice warm towel

15:46.028 --> 15:47.488
whenever you come out

15:46.028 --> 15:47.488
of the shower?

15:47.530 --> 15:49.073
Will you shut up?

15:47.530 --> 15:49.073
He's going to be fine.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.409
Whatever you say... sir.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.119
Come on.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.496
Hey.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.665
I'm sorry, I was here first.

15:57.707 --> 15:58.999
No, you weren't. We're next.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.710
I'll only take a minute.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.003
I've only got two things

16:00.752 --> 16:03.003
to try on.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.005
Lady, we've been waiting

16:03.045 --> 16:05.005
in line for a half hour.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.633
We have to meet our mom.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.384
I'm sorry, but we're next.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.385
Back off, brat!

16:09.427 --> 16:10.595
This may be

16:09.427 --> 16:10.595
your first sale,

16:10.637 --> 16:11.638
but it isn't mine!

16:11.679 --> 16:12.680
Let him go.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.014
It's our turn.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.057
Looks like you need someone

16:15.099 --> 16:16.976
to teach you

16:15.099 --> 16:16.976
to mind your elders.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.438
You looking for a dance partner?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.315
You think you can do

16:22.356 --> 16:23.608
whatever you want, don't you?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.025
That people

16:23.650 --> 16:25.025
aren't going to say

16:25.067 --> 16:28.195
or do anything

16:25.067 --> 16:28.195
because you're... "frail."

16:28.237 --> 16:29.113
Deal's off.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.240
All right,

16:29.155 --> 16:31.240
Reese is back.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.910
You want to take your teeth out

16:31.282 --> 16:33.910
before we start this, Grandma?

16:33.952 --> 16:37.121
Oh, no, Reese is back.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.708
Hi, I'm Karen Tracy.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.335
I was speaking to one

16:40.750 --> 16:42.335
of your boys earlier.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.504
Oh, my God, I'll kill him.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.046
See, these kind of outbursts

16:46.088 --> 16:47.841
are exactly the sort of thing

16:46.088 --> 16:47.841
we can help you with.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.425
I'm with the Department

16:47.882 --> 16:49.425
of Child Services.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.218
What? What are you

16:49.467 --> 16:51.218
talking about?

16:51.260 --> 16:53.053
Look, we're not making

16:51.260 --> 16:53.053
any judgments yet,

16:53.095 --> 16:54.430
but the department takes

16:54.472 --> 16:56.056
the safety of children

16:54.472 --> 16:56.056
very seriously.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.976
I'd like you to come in

16:56.098 --> 16:57.976
for an evaluation.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.059
What's the last known

16:59.101 --> 17:00.854
address of the boy's father?

17:00.895 --> 17:03.356
Wait a minute.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.356
This is a mistake.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.691
My boys are fine.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.066
It wasn't me--

17:04.732 --> 17:06.066
somebody planted

17:06.108 --> 17:06.860
those teeth on me.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.068
These your kids?

17:08.110 --> 17:09.529
I was just trying

17:08.110 --> 17:09.529
to buy a slip,

17:09.570 --> 17:11.155
and they all jumped

17:09.570 --> 17:11.155
on me like jackals.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.740
MALCOLM:

17:11.197 --> 17:12.740
She's lying.

17:12.782 --> 17:13.950
We were just trying

17:12.782 --> 17:13.950
to pull Reese off of her.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.952
Oh, Lois, thank God I found you.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.787
Look, we got to get

17:15.994 --> 17:17.787
out of here before...

17:17.829 --> 17:19.413
(screaming)

17:22.000 --> 17:23.292
Run!

17:27.005 --> 17:30.008
Mom, seriously,

17:27.005 --> 17:30.008
get the lead out!

17:35.221 --> 17:36.973
You must be so happy.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.099
You wouldn't believe

17:37.015 --> 17:39.099
some of the families

17:39.141 --> 17:40.810
I have to deal with.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.102
Oh, girls.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.103
Hurry up.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.147
It's our turn at the register.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.274
I can't decide between the

17:45.189 --> 17:47.274
peach, the melon or the salmon.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.985
I just have to

17:47.316 --> 17:48.985
get all three.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.111
No, honey, now you're

17:49.027 --> 17:51.111
going to make a choice.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.697
Gee, Mom, if you're

17:51.153 --> 17:52.697
going to force me

17:52.739 --> 17:54.323
to wear knock-offs,

17:52.739 --> 17:54.323
can I at least

17:54.365 --> 17:55.408
just get

17:54.365 --> 17:55.408
what I want?

17:55.449 --> 17:56.617
Here you go, sweetie.

17:56.659 --> 17:57.827
Here's the makeup

17:56.659 --> 17:57.827
you wanted.

17:57.869 --> 17:58.703
Oh, thank you

17:57.869 --> 17:58.703
so much, Daddy.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.913
Hal, what are you doing?

17:59.954 --> 18:01.372
We said she couldn't have that.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.123
Well, she asked me again

18:03.165 --> 18:05.292
and told me that you said

18:03.165 --> 18:05.292
it would be okay after all,

18:05.334 --> 18:07.211
and then, you know,

18:05.334 --> 18:07.211
she started...

18:07.253 --> 18:09.129
getting all teary-eyed.

18:09.171 --> 18:13.133
You know, I...

18:09.171 --> 18:13.133
I-I just... I...

18:13.175 --> 18:15.845
Mallory, how could you do that?

18:15.887 --> 18:17.847
Don't worry, Mom. I won't

18:15.887 --> 18:17.847
wear it around the house.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.099
I know how desperate you are

18:17.889 --> 18:20.099
to be the prettiest.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.398
Mallory, I think we're all

18:25.187 --> 18:27.398
getting a little bit frazzled.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.315
Why don't we

18:28.357 --> 18:30.026
talk about this when

18:30.068 --> 18:31.402
we're modeling our clothes

18:30.068 --> 18:31.402
for each other at home.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.987
Yeah, that's

18:31.444 --> 18:32.987
really good, Mom,

18:33.029 --> 18:35.155
because by that time the

18:33.029 --> 18:35.155
buzz from her diet pills

18:35.197 --> 18:36.449
will have worn off.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.784
Diet pills?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.410
I have a slow

18:37.825 --> 18:39.410
metabolism, okay?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.871
And I don't burn up calories

18:39.452 --> 18:41.871
having sex with a different boy

18:41.913 --> 18:43.330
every night down by the creek.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.750
I thought you were

18:43.372 --> 18:45.750
at band practice every night.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.167
There is no band!

18:47.209 --> 18:49.211
Shut up, flatsy patsy,

18:47.209 --> 18:49.211
you don't know anything.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.421
I know you're pregnant.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.173
She is lying.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.173
That is ridiculous.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.884
I am not pregnant,

18:53.215 --> 18:54.884
because I know

18:54.926 --> 18:56.886
that sex is wrong

18:54.926 --> 18:56.886
and immoral and fun.

18:56.928 --> 18:57.887
No, wait...

18:57.929 --> 18:59.179
It's all right, Renee.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.514
It's good

18:59.221 --> 19:00.514
that they know.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.102
I'm ready for

19:02.016 --> 19:04.102
teenage marriage.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.185
It'll be awesome.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.270
He's the father?

19:06.312 --> 19:07.438
You only slept with him

19:07.480 --> 19:09.189
because you knew

19:07.480 --> 19:09.189
that I liked him!

19:09.231 --> 19:11.191
Maybe you should have asked

19:09.231 --> 19:11.191
to use my hair brush first.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.070
(girls shouting)

19:18.240 --> 19:20.076
Girls, please, can you just...?

19:20.118 --> 19:21.869
Girls, don't do this.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.454
You're supposed to be easy.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.914
No, Mom,

19:23.496 --> 19:24.914
you're easy.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.206
DAISY: We can fool you

19:24.956 --> 19:26.206
about anything.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.709
We're girls.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.709
We know how you think.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.670
And we're not above using it.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.172
FRANCIS:

19:30.711 --> 19:33.172
Mom, Dad, hi.

19:35.466 --> 19:36.926
Francis,

19:35.466 --> 19:36.926
what are you doing here?

19:36.968 --> 19:38.636
You're supposed to be

19:36.968 --> 19:38.636
away at college.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.014
I dropped out,

19:38.678 --> 19:41.014
but don't worry, I'm working.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.057
At the new Hooters

19:41.055 --> 19:43.057
out by the lumberyard.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.100
With tips, I can

19:44.142 --> 19:45.225
pay rent on the trailer

19:45.267 --> 19:46.477
and still keep

19:45.267 --> 19:46.477
my husband in beer.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.812
Hey, got to go.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.271
Cockfight starts

19:47.854 --> 19:49.271
in half an hour.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.231
You still got to load

19:49.313 --> 19:51.231
the cages into my pickup.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.151
Uh, you know, you could

19:51.273 --> 19:53.151
talk to my daughter...

19:53.192 --> 19:54.234
Leave him alone!

19:54.276 --> 19:55.235
You never like

19:55.277 --> 19:56.612
any of my husbands.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.072
You've always tried

19:56.654 --> 19:58.072
to come between us,

19:58.114 --> 19:59.239
and that's why I hate you!

19:59.281 --> 20:00.116
Ever since you lost

20:00.158 --> 20:01.241
all that weight,

20:01.283 --> 20:02.326
nothing is ever

20:01.283 --> 20:02.326
good enough for you!

20:02.368 --> 20:04.328
(girls shouting)

20:04.370 --> 20:06.873
This isn't right.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.750
Girls don't do these things.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.211
Girls are nicer.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.254
Girls are better.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.255
Oh, come off it.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.549
Who do you think

20:15.297 --> 20:16.549
made us this way?

20:16.590 --> 20:18.843
It's all your fault.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.179
(girls shouting)

20:25.975 --> 20:28.268
Honey, come on, you can do it.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.271
It's just another 300 yards

20:28.310 --> 20:31.271
after Señor Jelly Bean's.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.066
Trust me, Hal.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.066
There's no escape.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.317
There's no escape

20:33.107 --> 20:35.317
no matter what.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.867
Happy Valentine's Day,

20:40.406 --> 20:42.867
honey.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.994
It finally came

20:42.909 --> 20:44.994
to me last night.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.537
The perfect gift.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.248
And I know you'll love it

20:46.579 --> 20:49.248
because it's not for you.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.336
Thank you, Hal. It's perfect.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.296
Come on, Dad,

20:54.378 --> 20:56.296
let's go.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.464
Oh, I get Malcolm.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.592
Wait, we almost

20:57.506 --> 20:59.592
forgot the thing.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.888
Happy Valentine's

21:02.344 --> 21:03.888
Day, Mom.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.139
Yeah, happy Valentine's Day.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.306
DEWEY: We saved you

21:05.181 --> 21:06.306
the coconut ones

21:06.348 --> 21:07.600
'cause we know

21:06.348 --> 21:07.600
they're you're favorite.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.269
Thank you, boys. I love it.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.064
See you in a bit.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.985
I hope you're a girl.
