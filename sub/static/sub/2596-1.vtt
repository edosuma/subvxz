01:01.698 --> 01:04.602
- Johanna?
- I'm here.

01:04.702 --> 01:06.410
Yes.

01:18.282 --> 01:21.217
I'd like to wear my blue dress.

01:21.619 --> 01:23.498
Yes, ma'am.

03:11.094 --> 03:13.898
Hi. Yes. I'd like to report a death.

03:13.998 --> 03:15.873
Yes, ma'am.

03:16.667 --> 03:20.721
No... I don't know. She's very old.

03:21.406 --> 03:23.576
I take care of her.

03:25.053 --> 03:27.177
No, I work here.

03:27.879 --> 03:29.512
Yes, ma'am.

04:02.279 --> 04:03.864
I hope it was peaceful.

04:05.260 --> 04:07.916
It was in her sleep. Thank you.

04:10.153 --> 04:12.711
So, you got another job lined up there?

04:13.791 --> 04:18.928
Yeah. Whole new everything.
Mrs. Willits' pastor set it up.

05:21.891 --> 05:24.126
Hey, gorgeous!

05:24.428 --> 05:26.093
Hey, Dad.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.098
- Hey, Edith.
- Hi.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.167
What's going on?

06:27.256 --> 06:30.628
I'll just leave you with it. There's this
model that I wrote out to get the loan.

06:30.728 --> 06:31.786
'Cause I think if you check that out...

06:31.886 --> 06:34.765
Are you sure you want to have
this conversation?

06:34.865 --> 06:37.228
It's a really good opportunity.

06:37.602 --> 06:39.368
I just thought you might be
interested in it.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.203
Why don't you just leave him alone?

06:41.539 --> 06:45.575
- It is a really good opportunity.
- There's a lady over there.

07:02.125 --> 07:05.396
I'm Johanna Parry from Plainfield.
The pastor sent me.

07:05.496 --> 07:09.906
Oh, yes, we've been expecting you.
Only a suitcase and a bag?

07:11.135 --> 07:14.253
Oh, this my granddaughter...

07:14.353 --> 07:16.807
Sabitha. She lives in the house with me.

07:17.124 --> 07:19.933
And that makes me Ken.
I'm Sabitha's father.

07:20.444 --> 07:23.088
He's usually not here.
He doesn't live here.

07:25.343 --> 07:27.985
Did you have any problems
finding the house?

07:28.085 --> 07:29.720
Oh, no, I asked in town.

07:29.820 --> 07:33.157
Oh. Good. Good. Okay.

07:33.557 --> 07:35.994
We're going to the astro later
for burgers, if you want to join us.

07:36.094 --> 07:39.916
- Ken, please. She just got here.
- I'm just being friendly, Bill.

07:40.498 --> 07:42.564
Let me show you to your room.

07:47.137 --> 07:49.040
- She's gonna be working here?
- Yeah.

07:49.140 --> 07:51.206
Look at her shoes.

09:19.029 --> 09:21.432
Oh, shit. You scared the hell out of me.

09:21.532 --> 09:26.097
Sorry. I was just looking
for some hangers.

09:26.237 --> 09:28.606
Well, they're not in here.

09:29.306 --> 09:31.700
- These are Mr. Mccauley's.
- Yeah.

09:38.114 --> 09:39.361
How much is he paying you?

09:39.761 --> 09:43.143
I'm only asking 'cause he's a cheapskate,
and I wouldn't want him ripping you off.

09:53.138 --> 09:58.202
Hey, don't tell Sabitha I got a headache.
She'll just worry about me, okay?

09:58.602 --> 10:00.736
Thanks, gorgeous.

10:11.061 --> 10:13.917
And now turn.

10:17.488 --> 10:18.873
Let's see.

10:23.661 --> 10:27.432
- Send it.
- What's taking him so long?

10:40.376 --> 10:42.747
So, you know Sabitha from school?

10:43.247 --> 10:44.815
What?

10:45.579 --> 10:47.234
Yeah.

10:49.987 --> 10:51.718
Where does her mother live?

10:53.357 --> 10:55.090
She died.

11:02.064 --> 11:06.069
Oh, my God. Stevie thought
Johanna was your mom.

11:06.236 --> 11:09.239
Look. "Sabitha's mom seems weird."

11:09.339 --> 11:11.909
Please text him back
and tell him she's not my mom.

11:12.209 --> 11:13.143
Get down.

11:13.244 --> 11:15.479
Hey, you missed the action
at the astro burger, Bill.

11:17.681 --> 11:21.952
You're not gonna be home to Chicago
till 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning.

11:22.172 --> 11:25.190
Well, I was thinking I'd just stay
and then leave tomorrow.

11:28.659 --> 11:30.902
I don't think that's a good idea.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.885
I'm glad you're here at least.

11:39.470 --> 11:41.739
Sabitha needs someone like you.

11:48.744 --> 11:50.743
Where did grandpa go?

11:51.126 --> 11:53.617
- He's supposed to take Edith home.
- I'll drive her home.

11:53.717 --> 11:55.686
You know, that's okay.
I can call my mom.

11:55.886 --> 11:57.604
Not a problem.

12:03.259 --> 12:05.976
Her parents don't want her
driving with you.

12:17.774 --> 12:18.563
Come on.

12:18.663 --> 12:21.428
- I wasn't driving...
- It was an accident. It was an accident.

12:21.528 --> 12:24.049
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Damn it!

12:25.649 --> 12:28.716
And now you're trying to suck up to me

12:28.816 --> 12:34.696
to get my money
for your sleazy motel Ponzi scheme?

12:35.192 --> 12:38.562
The thing is, I got the motel
for practically nothing, right?

12:38.662 --> 12:40.885
So, when it's up and running,
it's all profit.

12:40.985 --> 12:43.868
I'd pay you back in three months,
four at the most.

12:43.968 --> 12:48.256
Yeah, well, you haven't paid me back
from the last time I lent you money.

12:51.842 --> 12:54.408
That was mainly for Marcel, wasn't it?

12:58.415 --> 13:02.909
I mean, I just... I think if you saw the
improvements I've done, you'd jump right in.

13:06.357 --> 13:09.906
You know, Ken, I'm really trying here.

13:10.294 --> 13:14.291
I'm really trying. You know,
Marcel would have been 36 last month.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.793
- Yeah, I know that.
- Do you know that?

13:31.314 --> 13:34.392
I miss her, too, Bill, a lot, okay?

13:57.140 --> 13:58.856
Okay.

14:02.412 --> 14:04.979
I have to drive Edith home.

15:32.235 --> 15:36.134
$18,643 on the dot.

15:36.234 --> 15:39.332
For a savings account, I'm gonna
need a government-issued I.D.,

15:39.432 --> 15:43.840
and I put some X's there
to show you where to sign at.

15:44.414 --> 15:47.651
- May I have a bank book?
- Oh. Thank you.

15:47.751 --> 15:51.322
You live with Mr. Mccauley over in
South Cedar? He banks here, too.

15:53.223 --> 15:55.459
You're the one taking care
of his granddaughter.

15:55.559 --> 15:56.393
Yeah.

15:56.493 --> 16:03.153
See Sabitha is in class with my grandsons.
they're twins, both football players.

16:03.433 --> 16:05.282
Yep.

16:06.136 --> 16:09.612
Oh, gosh, poor little thing...
Sabitha, I mean.

16:09.873 --> 16:11.361
Well...

16:11.761 --> 16:14.763
losing her mother
in that terrible accident, right?

16:14.863 --> 16:18.320
And then having her father
go off to prison like that.

16:19.149 --> 16:22.654
- Just...
- It's none of my business.

16:24.188 --> 16:28.092
Thank you. I'll be home at 5:30.

16:49.453 --> 16:50.751
Yes?

16:52.149 --> 16:55.753
My dad left this note for you
in the letter he wrote me.

16:57.187 --> 16:59.154
Oh. Okay.

17:08.531 --> 17:10.012
Thank you.

17:57.079 --> 18:01.652
Stephen. S-T-E-P-H-E-N.

18:01.952 --> 18:04.521
Hateship, friendship, courtship,
loveship, marriage, hateship...

18:04.621 --> 18:06.590
Friendship! Shit. It's friendship.

18:06.690 --> 18:09.226
This woman says she can reach
orgasm just by shaking her leg.

18:09.326 --> 18:11.662
The only thing worse than
friendship is hateship.

18:11.762 --> 18:14.782
Wait, this other woman started
masturbating when she was 8 years old,

18:14.882 --> 18:16.900
rubbing up against
some doll she slept with.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.444
Do you think Stevie's ever sex?

18:18.569 --> 18:20.671
I heard he screwed
Robin Simpson with his socks on.

18:20.771 --> 18:21.805
Oh, my God.

18:23.072 --> 18:26.422
So, what do you think about?
How do you do it?

18:26.722 --> 18:29.713
- Shut up.
- What? It's totally normal.

18:29.813 --> 18:31.048
Yeah, totally.

18:31.148 --> 18:33.952
'Cause you're my best friend,
I'll tell you.

18:34.052 --> 18:35.770
My parents have a handheld shower
in their bathroom,

18:35.870 --> 18:39.223
- so whenever I'm alone in the house...
- Okay, thank you! TMI! No more.

18:39.323 --> 18:41.091
What? It's totally normal.
Everyone does it.

18:41.191 --> 18:43.293
- Totally normal.
- It is.

18:43.793 --> 18:45.929
Hold on a second!

18:46.515 --> 18:48.332
I don't know. Let me just...

18:48.832 --> 18:50.567
Get... get that.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.242
Oh, God.

18:54.604 --> 18:55.852
Just...

18:56.306 --> 18:58.609
- God, she's so annoying.
- Do you think she heard?

18:58.709 --> 19:00.128
Come in!

19:09.554 --> 19:11.689
I told grandpa I'd clean up later.

19:13.172 --> 19:15.116
I need your father's address.

19:18.128 --> 19:19.963
Why?

19:20.063 --> 19:22.331
I have a card for him.

19:23.533 --> 19:24.516
Why?

19:24.616 --> 19:27.802
I'm just responding
to the note that he wrote me.

19:34.379 --> 19:38.148
You know, I'm going right by the
post office. I can mail that for you.

19:38.248 --> 19:39.449
Thank you.

19:39.809 --> 19:44.221
Oh, it's not a problem at all.
I go right by there, so...

19:44.621 --> 19:45.820
There you go.

19:54.031 --> 19:55.933
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.341
Bye.

20:07.812 --> 20:09.643
Did you have a good day?

20:09.743 --> 20:12.320
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

20:20.623 --> 20:24.364
- I waited for you to open it.
- Oh, my God.

20:30.424 --> 20:32.979
"Dear Mr. Ken Gaudette,"

20:33.079 --> 20:36.593
"I just thought I would write
and send my thanks to you"

20:36.693 --> 20:39.456
"for the nice things
you said in your note,"

20:39.556 --> 20:44.214
"in which you included in your
daughter's note..." Ever hear of grammar?

20:44.314 --> 20:47.256
"I'm grateful for you saying
that since some people"

20:47.356 --> 20:52.554
"feel that a person like me
that they do not know the..."

20:52.654 --> 20:56.793
"the background of is
beyond the pale." What?

20:56.893 --> 20:59.529
This doesn't make sense.
She capitalized "beyond the pale."

20:59.629 --> 21:03.599
Isn't that... that means, like,
the other side of the tracks.

21:04.735 --> 21:06.737
"I was born in Ames,"

21:06.837 --> 21:09.735
"but my mother and my brother and me"

21:09.835 --> 21:12.475
"moved to Twin View Heights
when I was a girl."

21:12.575 --> 21:13.910
No.

21:14.010 --> 21:15.990
Blah, blah.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.850
"Then I cared for Mrs. Willits."
Blah, blah.

21:19.950 --> 21:21.509
"I'm afraid I've bored you long enough."

21:21.609 --> 21:22.953
- You can say that again.
- No kidding.

21:23.053 --> 21:26.757
"Thank you for your good opinion
and for taking me to the restaurant."

21:26.857 --> 21:29.192
"It was a pleasure to be included."

21:29.292 --> 21:33.138
"Your friend, Johanna Parry."

21:34.464 --> 21:38.302
Say something about her beautiful hair.
This has to be realistic.

21:39.002 --> 21:42.937
"I was so happy to see that you...

21:43.037 --> 21:46.409
underlined 'your friend'"

21:46.509 --> 21:50.274
Someone like me, with a checkered past,

21:50.374 --> 21:54.036
can use all the friends he can get.

21:54.918 --> 22:01.274
Sometimes I think, 'who is my friend?'

22:02.959 --> 22:06.976
"Then comes your letter."

22:07.476 --> 22:08.231
That's boring.

22:08.331 --> 22:10.400
Well, we can't just immediately write
that he wants to suck her titties.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.402
Okay, how about you say something like,

22:13.502 --> 22:16.606
"you should wear your hair back more often
so the world can see your pretty face"?

22:16.706 --> 22:18.408
- How about that?
- That's good.

22:18.508 --> 22:20.343
Yeah.

22:21.578 --> 22:23.267
Stevie!

22:31.989 --> 22:37.014
"P.S., let's continue
this correspondence"

22:37.114 --> 22:41.430
"through e-mail. It's much faster."

22:41.531 --> 22:45.570
"My address is kengaudette..."

22:45.670 --> 22:50.520
"...12step@hotmail.com."

22:50.820 --> 22:55.812
"And we'll save money on stamps."

22:55.912 --> 22:58.048
Why did you have to put
the "12 step" thing?

22:58.148 --> 22:59.921
For authenticity.

23:00.884 --> 23:02.886
What? Recovery is a good thing.

23:26.443 --> 23:28.376
I'll talk to you later.

23:36.946 --> 23:41.892
- Why are you staring at me?
- Oh, I'm not... I don't mean to.

23:41.992 --> 23:44.094
Why are you even in here?

23:44.394 --> 23:46.997
- Came to...
- Yeah. Okay.

23:47.197 --> 23:50.999
We were just kissing, okay?
Normal people do that.

24:56.966 --> 24:59.247
That was my wife's furniture.

25:00.270 --> 25:05.200
My wife gave it to my daughter
when she and Ken first got married.

25:06.609 --> 25:10.575
After his poor judgment killed
my daughter, I...

25:10.875 --> 25:13.303
I took that furniture back.

25:14.451 --> 25:18.785
There's no reason for him
to have it. Why should he?

25:19.322 --> 25:21.791
It just sits out here.
It seems like a waste.

25:22.391 --> 25:24.763
Maybe he could use it
in his hotel lobby.

25:27.463 --> 25:31.164
He couldn't run a one-pump gas station.

26:43.071 --> 26:45.279
That one doesn't work.

26:49.511 --> 26:53.307
- When will you be finished?
- Well, you have to sign up.

26:55.051 --> 26:57.389
First name.

26:59.722 --> 27:01.960
Click the mouse for the last.

27:06.863 --> 27:08.664
And then your password.

27:08.764 --> 27:11.480
- My own word?
- Your own word.

27:14.870 --> 27:17.207
We're staying near the White House.

27:17.407 --> 27:19.933
- Is that boy going?
- His name's Stevie,

27:20.033 --> 27:22.846
and, no, he's not going. He went last year,
so you don't have to worry.

27:22.946 --> 27:24.714
Oh, okay, I won't worry.

27:25.114 --> 27:30.060
Sabitha, is that thing
surgically attached to your hand?

27:31.454 --> 27:33.020
Thank you, Johanna.

27:36.059 --> 27:38.152
Put that away.

29:10.185 --> 29:12.223
Come back.

29:14.162 --> 29:19.273
The ad says 10:00 to 3:00.
You don't have to get there exactly at 10:00.

29:19.762 --> 29:21.270
If I want the job, I do.

29:31.239 --> 29:35.078
And you're gonna breathe
paint fumes all day?

29:38.781 --> 29:41.050
That only pays like $8 an hour.

29:41.150 --> 29:44.571
Well, it's better than
sitting around watching TV all day.

29:45.121 --> 29:48.992
My brother manages
a huge food warehouse.

29:49.092 --> 29:52.762
They're always hiring forklifters,
and they pay them like 20 bucks an hour.

29:52.862 --> 29:55.261
I don't know how to drive a forklift.

29:58.167 --> 30:00.403
He'll be back in three weeks.

30:01.571 --> 30:03.705
You'll make a lot more money.

30:08.428 --> 30:11.950
- He isn't gonna hire me.
- Yeah. I'll tell him to.

30:13.065 --> 30:15.153
I got to check this out first.

30:15.368 --> 30:17.570
Just let yourself out when you're ready.

30:17.670 --> 30:21.092
You have the 30 bucks you owe
me for dinner last night?

30:21.407 --> 30:24.196
That's not even including the blow.

30:24.911 --> 30:31.371
"I'm sitting here
drinking a glass of Chardonnay,"

30:31.482 --> 30:35.474
"wishing I could hold you"

30:35.574 --> 30:38.512
"tight in my arms."

30:38.958 --> 30:43.147
In reality, he's probably sitting in his
underwear somewhere, drinking warm beer.

30:43.863 --> 30:47.652
"I must say goodbye."

30:47.767 --> 30:53.563
"And the only way
I can do it is to imagine you"

30:53.663 --> 30:57.757
"reading this in your nightgown,

30:58.057 --> 31:00.680
"thinking about me,"

31:00.791 --> 31:05.337
"as you drift off to sleep."

31:18.897 --> 31:21.438
Come on, grandpa!
We're going to be late!

31:24.704 --> 31:26.475
Hi.

31:28.341 --> 31:32.564
I came to get my black sweater.
I texted you like five times.

31:33.179 --> 31:35.581
You... you told me I could borrow it.

31:35.681 --> 31:38.463
I'm sure your grandfather
can buy you one.

31:45.056 --> 31:48.413
Why'd you tell Melissa and Jessica
that I couldn't afford to go to D.C.?

31:49.928 --> 31:53.099
- You told me you couldn't afford it.
- I didn't mean for you to tell everyone.

31:53.399 --> 31:56.521
That's the bitchiest thing
you've ever done to me.

31:57.036 --> 32:00.054
God, I didn't know it was some big secret.
If I would have known, I wouldn't have said...

32:00.165 --> 32:01.260
If you weren't so stupid and selfish,

32:01.360 --> 32:03.295
you'd understand that I don't want
the whole school knowing.

32:04.010 --> 32:05.945
Look, Edith, no one at school cares.

32:19.891 --> 32:21.939
You're so evil.

32:23.229 --> 32:26.184
Are you kidding? She loves this.

32:30.836 --> 32:33.290
Actually, it's pretty mean.

32:49.589 --> 32:51.408
"You're beautiful..."

33:44.817 --> 33:46.631
Hello. May I help you?

33:46.746 --> 33:49.782
Yes, I would like to try on the suit
in the window, the shiny one.

33:49.882 --> 33:52.003
Oh, that's a lovely suit.

33:52.518 --> 33:54.075
Yes.

33:55.321 --> 33:57.002
Oh, it's so expensive.

33:57.102 --> 34:01.090
Well, it's very fine silk. It's Italian.

34:07.850 --> 34:12.617
Well, of course you'll need
your nylons and your heels

34:12.717 --> 34:17.943
and some lipstick,
but with some tailoring, it might work.

34:18.043 --> 34:20.531
How does it feel? Is it comfortable?

34:21.045 --> 34:25.762
The suit feels fine. There's nothing
the matter with the suit.

34:26.362 --> 34:28.621
Sometimes that's just the way it is.

34:28.721 --> 34:31.824
You never know till you try
something on.

34:31.924 --> 34:33.878
Hold on.

34:53.645 --> 34:57.935
Why don't you slip into this,
just for the heck of it?

35:21.606 --> 35:25.163
Come out here and look at it
in the big mirror.

35:37.722 --> 35:39.892
Well, I better take it off
so you can wrap it up.

35:39.992 --> 35:41.966
Wonderful.

35:44.864 --> 35:47.585
It's probably what I'm gonna
be married in.

35:57.242 --> 36:00.012
You know what why I got you a red car?

36:00.112 --> 36:02.948
Because red cars get the most tickets.

36:03.048 --> 36:05.985
So, if you get any tickets,
you have to pay for it yourself.

36:06.085 --> 36:08.106
I won't be getting any tickets.

36:09.221 --> 36:11.539
- Hi, Johanna.
- Oh, hi.

36:12.391 --> 36:14.676
I'll start dinner right away.

36:14.788 --> 36:18.393
- I got this for my dad for Christmas.
- Oh, that's nice.

36:18.906 --> 36:21.221
I got this one for Edith.

36:22.297 --> 36:24.327
She really wanted one.

36:27.201 --> 36:28.654
Are you wearing makeup?

36:30.413 --> 36:34.232
- Oh, you look nice, Johanna.
- Oh, it's just...

36:34.447 --> 36:35.455
No. Here.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.204
Here. Try this.

36:50.695 --> 36:52.654
It's more natural.

36:54.206 --> 36:55.640
Thank you.

36:56.686 --> 36:58.027
Edith.

36:59.423 --> 37:01.414
I got this for you.

37:02.308 --> 37:03.761
Thanks.

37:05.043 --> 37:07.116
I talked to Jessica and Melissa.
Neither one of them said anything

37:07.216 --> 37:10.155
about why you didn't go on the trip.
They're not like that.

37:12.885 --> 37:15.239
Julie and Marie didn't go
'cause their parents couldn't pay.

37:15.454 --> 37:18.032
Are you gonna talk about this all day?

37:18.958 --> 37:20.526
I won't. Sorry.

37:20.626 --> 37:25.182
Stop bragging about your car.
It's kind of nauseating.

37:25.797 --> 37:28.634
I wasn't bragging. Justin asked me
about it, and I answered.

37:28.734 --> 37:31.222
What about the pictures on Facebook?

37:31.637 --> 37:33.224
That's bragging.

37:33.339 --> 37:36.728
If you got a car,
you'd be doing the same thing.

37:45.082 --> 37:47.906
So, there's a table, six chairs,

37:48.006 --> 37:51.679
a bed, dresser, sofa, coffee table,

37:51.779 --> 37:53.706
end tables, side...

37:53.806 --> 37:57.644
I'm sorry. I can't write that fast.
I can't...

37:57.794 --> 38:01.688
There's no kitchen stuff.
It's just one bedroom.

38:01.788 --> 38:04.005
It's only going to Chicago.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.410
All right...

38:06.710 --> 38:09.978
Well, if this is it,
you're probably looking at...

38:10.726 --> 38:13.187
$2,300, $2,500.

38:13.996 --> 38:16.250
Seems like a lot.

38:16.565 --> 38:19.318
When's the last time you had
a bunch of furniture moved?

38:20.803 --> 38:24.358
You have somebody in Chicago who's gonna
be looking out for it when it gets there?

38:26.642 --> 38:30.313
Okay, we'll have my guys here
first thing Monday morning.

38:30.413 --> 38:31.908
After 9:00.

38:32.008 --> 38:35.437
They can't be here before 9:00.
After 9:30, actually. 9:30.

38:37.019 --> 38:38.520
Okay.

38:40.522 --> 38:45.373
- You know, we'll send you a bill for this.
- I'd rather pay now. $2,300?

38:45.473 --> 38:47.848
That's fine. That's good.

40:38.660 --> 40:40.268
Hello?

40:51.517 --> 40:53.369
Hello?

41:14.475 --> 41:16.051
Hello?

42:48.836 --> 42:50.158
Hello?

46:08.960 --> 46:10.131
Oh, you're awake.

46:16.110 --> 46:18.113
What are you doing here?

46:18.413 --> 46:20.682
Didn't you get my e-mail?

46:21.049 --> 46:23.343
I don't have e-mail.

46:38.799 --> 46:40.621
I sent you e-mails.

46:44.739 --> 46:47.272
I don't even have a computer.

47:12.833 --> 47:16.315
Just so you know, I've been sick.
That's why this place isn't so clean.

47:16.415 --> 47:18.993
This stove hasn't been cleaned in years.

48:26.774 --> 48:28.160
Hey!

48:37.051 --> 48:39.850
There are no buses this time of night.

48:40.989 --> 48:42.775
You should just come back inside.

48:51.932 --> 48:53.746
You're gonna freeze out here.

48:55.596 --> 48:59.993
You know, we can just make up the couch
and sort this out tomorrow, okay?

49:42.116 --> 49:43.915
How are you feeling?

49:48.841 --> 49:50.811
I can't really tell.

49:51.026 --> 49:53.145
A little better maybe.

50:03.938 --> 50:07.294
You're swallowing your phlegm.
Don't do that. It's not good for you.

50:11.112 --> 50:15.335
Spit it out. You'll get in trouble
with your kidneys by swallowing it.

50:23.670 --> 50:25.589
You didn't find the coffee, did you?

51:37.564 --> 51:38.866
What are you doing?

51:38.966 --> 51:42.414
Cleaning the floor.
It could use some wax after.

51:51.378 --> 51:54.656
You're never gonna feel better
if you keep smoking like that.

51:59.587 --> 52:02.837
You know, anyone could have
been tricked by those two.

52:04.379 --> 52:06.360
Teenager girls are pretty nasty.

52:07.495 --> 52:09.976
You really don't have
to scrub the floor.

52:11.499 --> 52:14.307
Just trying to keep busy.

52:27.080 --> 52:31.587
- When do you have to be back at Bill's?
- I wasn't planning on going back.

52:37.125 --> 52:39.628
You really don't have a computer?

52:40.628 --> 52:42.950
No, I... I want to get one.

52:46.834 --> 52:48.547
You okay?

52:48.647 --> 52:51.561
Look, I don't know what happened.
I mean,

52:51.661 --> 52:54.095
I did put a note for you in
with the letter I sent to Sabitha,

52:54.206 --> 52:56.766
but I didn't send anything else.

52:58.079 --> 52:59.828
I'm sorry.

53:31.780 --> 53:33.637
Hi.

53:35.050 --> 53:36.614
Hi.

53:37.148 --> 53:39.144
I'm Chloe.

53:40.222 --> 53:43.072
- Who are you?
- I'm Johanna Parry.

53:44.292 --> 53:45.545
Ken's friend.

53:46.060 --> 53:48.997
Ken's friend from... where?

53:49.907 --> 53:51.563
From Iowa.

53:52.200 --> 53:54.128
I was taking care of his daughter.

53:56.204 --> 53:59.505
Wow. His daughter?

54:02.510 --> 54:04.667
Her name is Sabitha.

54:20.060 --> 54:23.383
- Where is he?
- Sleeping.

54:23.798 --> 54:26.362
- He's ill.
- Ill.

54:26.474 --> 54:28.873
- Yeah.
- Right.

54:57.932 --> 55:00.253
It's gonna be totally fun.
Everyone's gonna be there.

55:00.368 --> 55:02.811
Polo just got back from Seattle.

55:03.097 --> 55:04.639
I'm sick.

55:04.739 --> 55:07.093
I practically coughed up
a lung this morning.

55:07.208 --> 55:09.344
That Swedish guy is supposed
to bring some of this "x"

55:09.444 --> 55:11.906
that doesn't have any speed in it.

55:12.394 --> 55:14.015
You do actually look sick.

55:14.115 --> 55:17.168
- You should probably just sleep.
- That's what I've been saying.

55:18.820 --> 55:19.989
Johanna Parry?

55:20.089 --> 55:22.610
You're late. You were supposed
to be here this morning.

55:23.158 --> 55:25.846
Everything looks good. Thank you.

55:26.461 --> 55:28.813
Let's get this one last...

55:30.860 --> 55:34.819
- Come by later if you feel better.
- Probably not gonna happen.

55:34.919 --> 55:36.822
I'll call you.

55:37.037 --> 55:40.415
I can set a place for you
if you want to stay for dinner.

55:49.083 --> 55:52.212
- What's going on?
- That's the furniture.

56:09.302 --> 56:13.105
Does Bill know you're here? Sabitha?

56:15.076 --> 56:17.211
I didn't tell them.

56:19.514 --> 56:22.218
And Bill doesn't know you
took the furniture, does he?

56:22.318 --> 56:24.000
No, he doesn't.

56:30.023 --> 56:33.509
You just... you just took it?
How'd you do that?

56:34.962 --> 56:38.418
Mr. McCauley was at work,
and Sabitha was at school.

56:47.466 --> 56:49.647
And now it's all here.

56:49.747 --> 56:54.510
- There's no damage to any of it.
- No. No, I bet there's not.

56:56.851 --> 56:59.223
I bet he's fucking freaking out.

57:11.332 --> 57:13.983
Here. Here. I'll do that.

57:31.752 --> 57:34.422
She probably just got sick of it here.

57:34.522 --> 57:36.814
I always drive people away.

57:37.114 --> 57:38.921
- Where do you want these?
- Just right here is fine.

57:39.021 --> 57:40.717
All right.

57:42.697 --> 57:44.974
Maybe we can have your father out again.

57:48.503 --> 57:50.841
And this time, he can stay over.

57:51.806 --> 57:54.796
- I know you're trying with him.
- I am.

57:56.243 --> 57:59.098
I don't know how Johanna
ever cleaned this.

58:05.487 --> 58:07.738
Elbow grease.

58:11.758 --> 58:13.562
I was in the middle of
renovating when I got sick.

58:13.662 --> 58:17.524
So, I'm gonna put in new carpeting
and plumbing.

58:19.567 --> 58:21.938
I just need a bit more cash.

58:24.872 --> 58:26.857
You know you can't go back there now.

58:26.957 --> 58:29.687
He'll have you arrested
for stealing that furniture.

58:31.045 --> 58:33.132
I'll figure something out.

58:33.373 --> 58:36.501
You should take an aspirin before
you go to bed. You look a little pale.

58:39.653 --> 58:42.484
- You'll be all right in here again?
- Yeah.

58:47.794 --> 58:50.464
What about your family?
Can you stay with them?

58:52.106 --> 58:54.510
I'll be out of your hair tomorrow.

58:57.472 --> 58:59.390
Actually, you know what?

58:59.490 --> 59:02.417
You can't leave, anyway.
You're an outlaw now.

59:03.878 --> 59:06.345
I thought you might need that.

59:06.445 --> 59:08.428
I'll see you in the morning.

01:00:18.252 --> 01:00:23.224
Gone, just like that, thousands of dollars
worth of antique furniture.

01:00:23.324 --> 01:00:28.503
That's horrible. Are you gonna file a
police report? 'Cause you sure should.

01:00:28.603 --> 01:00:32.769
Mr. McCauley, I... I probably
shouldn't be saying this, but...

01:00:32.869 --> 01:00:37.639
she withdrew $21,000 in cash last week.

01:00:37.739 --> 01:00:39.865
No one here has ever done that.

01:00:41.976 --> 01:00:45.605
Well, I knew the moment I met her
that there was something a little,

01:00:45.705 --> 01:00:48.505
you know, peculiar with her.

01:00:48.983 --> 01:00:53.624
But I suppose you miss
having someone around, right?

01:00:59.159 --> 01:01:01.500
I miss my furniture.

01:01:03.601 --> 01:01:05.532
Yeah.

01:01:08.336 --> 01:01:10.505
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I think we're all set here.

01:01:11.405 --> 01:01:14.359
We're gonna have Stan review all this,
and then we'll get it to you in your office

01:01:14.459 --> 01:01:16.603
- early next week.
- All right.

01:01:16.703 --> 01:01:18.207
- Okay.
- Well.

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:20.969
- Thank you very much, Eileen.
- Thank you, Mr. McCauley.

01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:22.637
- All right.
- Right.

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:30.228
And, you know, I have to drop some
documents off down at Beckman's,

01:01:30.328 --> 01:01:33.594
and there's this new restaurant
I've been checking out down there.

01:01:33.694 --> 01:01:35.763
Quinn Davis has eaten there.

01:01:35.863 --> 01:01:40.669
Maybe, if you wanted to,
you could join me for lunch.

01:01:41.769 --> 01:01:46.169
That is the nicest offer,
but I... I really can't leave.

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:50.721
- Well, thank you for your help, Eileen.
- Thank you, Mr. McCauley.

01:01:51.042 --> 01:01:53.148
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:23.111
Oh, you're up.

01:02:24.085 --> 01:02:25.871
Thought you were gone for good.

01:02:33.486 --> 01:02:35.083
May I?

01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:44.379
Got you some fresh milk.

01:02:45.433 --> 01:02:48.770
Sit down. I'll bring you some aspirin
and some juice. I'll get dinner started.

01:02:50.871 --> 01:02:52.489
Need some help?

01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:54.768
No. I'm okay.

01:03:02.482 --> 01:03:04.986
I cared for Mrs. Willits since I was 15.

01:03:06.487 --> 01:03:07.753
She needed me there,

01:03:07.953 --> 01:03:11.926
so she didn't let me do a lot
of stuff outside the house.

01:03:12.026 --> 01:03:13.727
She didn't let you?

01:03:13.827 --> 01:03:16.525
Well, I went to Iowa city
with my neighbor,

01:03:16.843 --> 01:03:19.056
but then my neighbor moved.

01:03:32.205 --> 01:03:35.050
That appointment
I have in the morning...

01:03:35.602 --> 01:03:38.048
it's with my probation officer.

01:03:39.086 --> 01:03:41.536
And then I have a narcotics
anonymous meeting at 4:00.

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:54.982
You know I spent time in prison, right?

01:03:57.405 --> 01:03:59.692
It's none of my business.

01:04:03.577 --> 01:04:08.086
I crashed a speed boat
with Sabitha and her mom... Marcel.

01:04:12.252 --> 01:04:14.401
Marcel was killed.

01:04:16.957 --> 01:04:18.580
I know.

01:04:19.329 --> 01:04:21.052
You know.

01:04:25.031 --> 01:04:27.199
It was an accident.

01:04:32.872 --> 01:04:34.788
I was drunk.

01:04:35.782 --> 01:04:37.913
And high.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.992
Yeah, but it was still an accident.

01:04:56.662 --> 01:04:58.092
Oh, hey.

01:04:59.117 --> 01:05:01.234
I brought Chinese.

01:05:02.152 --> 01:05:05.980
We ate already.
I got an early day tomorrow.

01:05:22.488 --> 01:05:24.714
Kung pao chicken,

01:05:25.111 --> 01:05:27.503
spring rolls, moo shu pork,

01:05:27.703 --> 01:05:29.750
and the pancakes.

01:05:32.233 --> 01:05:34.435
What are you doing, babe?

01:05:34.535 --> 01:05:35.774
What are you doing?

01:05:36.771 --> 01:05:38.325
Hanging out with
"little house on the prairie"?

01:05:38.425 --> 01:05:40.076
- Don't say that.
- In your P.J.s?

01:05:40.176 --> 01:05:43.817
Having a sleepover or whatever?

01:05:43.917 --> 01:05:47.192
Listen, why don't you just
give me back the key and go, okay?

01:06:32.024 --> 01:06:34.727
You still owe me 200 bucks.

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:52.865
Sorry about that.

01:06:59.118 --> 01:07:01.389
- You remember them.
- No, I don't.

01:07:01.489 --> 01:07:06.527
Oh, they had... They had eight kids,
and they all played different instruments.

01:07:06.627 --> 01:07:10.464
And then they'd all play
those corny songs at the fair.

01:07:10.564 --> 01:07:12.366
I don't remember 'em!

01:07:12.466 --> 01:07:15.503
Well, one year, they had
a float in the parade.

01:07:15.603 --> 01:07:19.153
One of the daughters fell off
and she broke her little finger

01:07:19.253 --> 01:07:22.283
and they came to me,
wanting me to sue the whole damn town.

01:07:22.383 --> 01:07:25.372
Okay, wait. Wait. Wait. I remember them.
Did they have these big old buckteeth?

01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:27.656
Oh, God, I'm horrible.

01:07:27.756 --> 01:07:31.536
I don't know what
you talkin' about, ma'am.

01:07:32.494 --> 01:07:34.989
- You're horrible!
- Yes, I am.

01:07:35.389 --> 01:07:38.147
Wait. Wait. The blonde one... remember?
She always sang that same old song.

01:07:38.247 --> 01:07:41.053
What was that? <i>Hello, my baby,</i>

01:07:41.604 --> 01:07:46.244
<i>Hello, my honey,
hello, my ragtime gal...</i>

01:07:47.265 --> 01:07:49.471
Oh, gosh.

01:07:56.442 --> 01:07:58.564
- Well...
- Well...

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.611
I guess I should be going.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.713
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.481
All right.

01:08:05.652 --> 01:08:09.304
Yes, of course. I'm... I'm really
happy you came. Thank you.

01:08:09.404 --> 01:08:12.160
- Oh, no, no, no, thank you. Thank you.
- No, seriously.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.673
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:08:13.773 --> 01:08:15.555
Thank you.

01:08:18.098 --> 01:08:20.502
- All right, there you go. You in?
- Yep.

01:08:21.702 --> 01:08:23.372
And don't be a stranger.

01:08:23.471 --> 01:08:25.112
- No.
- All right? Okay.

01:08:49.995 --> 01:08:52.296
You know, I wouldn't want this
to ruin our business relationship.

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:55.264
No, me neither, not at all.

01:09:05.813 --> 01:09:07.899
Lift you!

01:09:09.216 --> 01:09:11.589
Yes, right here.

01:11:10.903 --> 01:11:13.225
How was the movie?

01:11:21.123 --> 01:11:22.462
It's past midnight.

01:11:23.027 --> 01:11:25.212
Supper ran late.

01:11:25.625 --> 01:11:27.299
"Really" late.

01:11:27.899 --> 01:11:29.798
Really late.

01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:41.772
Do you smell like perfume?

01:11:53.412 --> 01:11:58.993
I can't tell whether you smell
like Budweiser or Michelob.

01:12:00.988 --> 01:12:03.457
I do not know what you are
talking about.

01:12:03.757 --> 01:12:07.312
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12:17.523 --> 01:12:19.706
Where's Edith tonight?

01:12:20.166 --> 01:12:25.406
She's probably out screwing Stevie in the
back of his brother's crappy little jeep.

01:12:42.261 --> 01:12:47.139
Either someone on the bus
must have stolen it, or I lost it.

01:12:47.935 --> 01:12:50.404
I'm really very good with money.

01:12:50.504 --> 01:12:53.440
Yeah, I had my wallet stolen
on the bus once.

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.643
But they only took $400,
and there was a lot more in there.

01:12:56.743 --> 01:13:00.093
I know because I counted it
when I paid the movers.

01:13:01.732 --> 01:13:05.285
I told you I couldn't pay you back
for that if that's what you're hinting at.

01:13:05.385 --> 01:13:09.376
No. No, I just lost $400.

01:13:14.532 --> 01:13:17.085
I'll be back later, okay?

01:13:17.485 --> 01:13:19.587
Are you feeling well enough?

01:13:21.154 --> 01:13:23.430
Well, I still feel like shit,
but I can't miss a meeting with my P.O.

01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:26.626
Unless I got all kinds of bullshit
medical documentations and...

01:13:26.726 --> 01:13:29.575
- Did you take an aspirin?
- Yeah.

01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:34.214
Hey, it wouldn't surprise me
if Chloe took your money.

01:13:34.314 --> 01:13:38.585
I mean, she's pretty fucking sneaky.
She is a junkie, so...

01:13:39.185 --> 01:13:42.680
But if she comes over, don't say anything.
I'll... I'll handle it.

01:13:58.471 --> 01:13:59.867
<i>Hey, everybody, this is Craig Bruin.</i>

01:13:59.967 --> 01:14:02.743
<i>Welcome back to the morning radio,
live from Chicago.</i>

01:14:02.843 --> 01:14:06.567
<i>Today the weather is...
let's just say it's cold.</i>

01:14:32.518 --> 01:14:34.703
Wow, that smells great.

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:39.519
- What you making?
- Biscuits and beef stew. It's ready.

01:15:17.851 --> 01:15:19.673
You can start.

01:15:25.992 --> 01:15:28.086
I could get used to this.

01:16:35.028 --> 01:16:37.728
- Oh, shit.
- Sorry. I thought you were getting sick.

01:16:37.828 --> 01:16:40.860
- No, I was throwing this out.
- Sorry.

01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:26.122
Are you awake?

01:17:41.213 --> 01:17:43.473
I... I know I'm an idiot.

01:17:44.545 --> 01:17:48.380
And I... I just wanted to say...

01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:52.349
That...

01:21:00.059 --> 01:21:04.164
"You should wear your hair back more often
so the world can see your pretty face."

01:21:04.264 --> 01:21:09.117
- This is embarrassing.
- No, it's not. You do have a pretty face.

01:21:11.771 --> 01:21:14.823
- I don't want to read any more.
- Come on.

01:21:18.744 --> 01:21:23.316
"I've known since that afternoon at Astro
burger that you and I will be together."

01:21:23.416 --> 01:21:26.418
"I haven't stopped thinking about you."

01:21:27.787 --> 01:21:29.727
Well, I did think about you.

01:21:29.827 --> 01:21:32.662
- Not like that.
- Well...

01:21:33.213 --> 01:21:35.929
I do now, all the time.

01:21:43.668 --> 01:21:46.871
They wrote all about your past and...

01:21:47.258 --> 01:21:51.466
your time in prison
and your problems and...

01:21:51.566 --> 01:21:54.123
said how you don't have many friends.

01:21:57.583 --> 01:22:00.266
And how did you respond to that?

01:22:01.521 --> 01:22:03.977
I said I was your friend.

01:22:25.777 --> 01:22:29.005
I... I don't know how long
I can keep this up.

01:22:37.022 --> 01:22:38.858
It's Christmas.
Don't you want to get up?

01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:40.870
I'm fine here.

01:23:04.216 --> 01:23:06.105
Electronic cigarette.

01:23:06.205 --> 01:23:08.638
It's to help you quit smoking.

01:23:08.738 --> 01:23:11.806
Yeah. I got that.

01:23:20.532 --> 01:23:23.335
My two girls taking
care of me at Christmas?

01:23:24.637 --> 01:23:28.475
Hey, you know what? If I get that job,
maybe we can celebrate Christmas again,

01:23:28.575 --> 01:23:31.278
send Sabitha a better gift
and get you something good.

01:23:32.066 --> 01:23:34.169
I don't need anything.

01:23:36.415 --> 01:23:38.551
Well, you need breakfast.
I'm gonna make it, okay?

01:23:38.651 --> 01:23:40.806
It's got to be noon, doesn't it?

01:23:47.726 --> 01:23:49.402
Thank you.

01:24:06.678 --> 01:24:10.483
<i>We go to the bottom of the fourth
with the score St. Louis 2, Chicago nothing.</i>

01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:14.283
<i>It'll be 2, 3, and 4 in the Chicago order,
Bell, Pena, and Johnson</i>

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.422
<i>against the St. Louis righty, Murphy.</i>

01:24:16.522 --> 01:24:19.960
<i>The 1-0 to Bell, fast-ball strike
at the knees to even it up 1-1.</i>

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.663
<i>Bell leads off here, but the reason
Teruso likes him in two hole...</i>

01:24:23.763 --> 01:24:27.369
<i>the ability to hit and run...
excellent contact hitter.</i>

01:24:27.569 --> 01:24:31.790
<i>The 1-1... Bell has swung off.
Soft fly into right center. Will Paul...</i>

01:24:47.686 --> 01:24:50.908
I think we should go with brown one.
It's shinier. It'll be easier to clean.

01:24:51.819 --> 01:24:54.145
Okay, sounds good.

01:24:56.296 --> 01:24:59.949
Oh, that's probably Rachel. Will you
tell her I'll be there in 20 minutes?

01:25:00.049 --> 01:25:01.810
Yeah. We have to finish
the walls in 1B today,

01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:03.120
- just the walls.
- Okay.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.091
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Is this Ken Gaudette's phone?

01:25:06.191 --> 01:25:09.909
<i>Yes. Hi, Rachel. He's gonna be
on his way shortly. I'm so sorry.</i>

01:25:10.009 --> 01:25:12.932
Johanna? Is that you?

01:25:14.707 --> 01:25:16.311
Yes.

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:20.456
Why are you answering my dad's phone?

01:25:35.386 --> 01:25:38.104
He didn't say anything
about pressing charges, right?

01:25:38.204 --> 01:25:41.308
No. No, no, he won't.

01:25:45.978 --> 01:25:48.800
Shit. Here he comes. Okay.

01:25:50.449 --> 01:25:52.234
Hey, Bill.

01:25:53.953 --> 01:25:57.890
<i>The one-two pitch is a curve ball,
and strike three.</i>

01:25:59.257 --> 01:26:00.462
Smells like you're barbecuing.

01:26:00.692 --> 01:26:03.828
You trying to get back in prison
in time for softball season?

01:26:06.098 --> 01:26:07.678
Hi.

01:26:09.835 --> 01:26:13.440
We're just bringing back some furniture.
Johanna thought it was mine.

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.876
- It's not your furniture.
- I think that's up for debate.

01:26:16.976 --> 01:26:19.456
I explained the history to you.

01:26:19.556 --> 01:26:21.481
<i>...as we heard toward
the summer months...</i>

01:26:21.581 --> 01:26:23.049
Hey, sweetie.

01:26:25.017 --> 01:26:26.951
You're, like, with her now, aren't you?

01:26:29.388 --> 01:26:30.439
Yeah.

01:26:30.539 --> 01:26:33.507
If you and Edith weren't
so good at writing letters.

01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:39.166
<i>...was a stillwater pioneer at the high school
there before he went to Oklahoma state.</i>

01:26:40.666 --> 01:26:42.458
<i>So, 1-0, the fast ball...</i>

01:26:42.558 --> 01:26:44.940
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.743
<i>Berkins centers in,
and here's the one-two pitch.</i>

01:26:52.055 --> 01:26:53.979
You boys want to help
with the furniture?

01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:57.150
<i>...and roll to the wall,
as Dsango's around first.</i>

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:59.215
<i>He is headed into second with a...</i>

01:26:59.315 --> 01:27:00.854
- Get out.
- Sabitha, look...

01:27:00.954 --> 01:27:04.178
- Are you deaf? Get out!
- Look, I... I understand...

01:27:04.278 --> 01:27:07.136
If you're trying to bond with me,
just forget it and get out.

01:27:08.294 --> 01:27:11.208
- My father...
- I don't care.

01:27:21.706 --> 01:27:23.823
Your father's trying.

01:27:30.616 --> 01:27:35.023
- I know that you're mad at him.
- I'm not mad at him.

01:27:52.004 --> 01:27:54.650
Why do you get to live with him?

01:28:07.252 --> 01:28:10.823
We're gonna finish unloading
the furniture.

01:28:18.763 --> 01:28:21.695
He wears that sweatshirt all the time,

01:28:22.614 --> 01:28:24.779
the one that you gave him.

01:28:32.677 --> 01:28:35.199
I like your shoes.

01:28:38.883 --> 01:28:40.589
Thank you.

01:29:27.232 --> 01:29:29.394
Hey, Sabitha?

01:29:31.209 --> 01:29:35.379
We were thinking that maybe you should
come back to Chicago with us and...

01:29:35.679 --> 01:29:38.511
you know,
stay for the rest of the summer.

01:29:38.611 --> 01:29:42.829
Wow. What an amazing offer.

01:29:45.351 --> 01:29:48.954
Or whatever you think is right, Bill.

01:29:49.054 --> 01:29:51.706
I mean, it would just be for the summer.

01:29:57.228 --> 01:29:59.259
Do you want to?

01:29:59.359 --> 01:30:02.268
You'd come back here in the fall
and finish school and...

01:30:03.068 --> 01:30:05.222
We'd love to have you.

01:30:05.963 --> 01:30:09.788
<i>...but a stop sign awaits him,
and he'll scramble back to the bag.</i>

01:30:16.758 --> 01:30:18.049
Where you going?

01:30:19.517 --> 01:30:21.442
To pack my stuff.

01:30:23.155 --> 01:30:26.859
<i>...didn't have that much of a lead.
That may have cost him.</i>

01:30:26.959 --> 01:30:30.550
Her car will remain here.

01:30:31.450 --> 01:30:33.366
Okay. Yeah.

01:30:33.466 --> 01:30:38.856
He's like mowing the lawn, doesn't have
a shirt on, of course. He's all wet.

01:30:38.971 --> 01:30:41.277
She's really cute in the video, too.
She's got, like,

01:30:41.377 --> 01:30:44.069
you know, the bangs and high heels.

01:30:44.169 --> 01:30:48.781
She's washing the car, trying to get
his attention. It's a bit obnoxious.

01:30:48.881 --> 01:30:50.416
What does this have to do
with the Olympics?

01:30:51.016 --> 01:30:53.920
Oh, the swim team made a video
to it and put it on the Internet.

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.279
It went, like, completely viral.

01:31:15.241 --> 01:31:17.877
You think my dad will ever pay you back?

01:31:18.277 --> 01:31:20.146
He and I are working
on this place together.

01:31:21.246 --> 01:31:23.933
Yeah, but you're paying
for most of it, right?

01:31:24.817 --> 01:31:26.937
We're working together.

01:31:29.108 --> 01:31:31.323
This smells so gross.

01:31:31.423 --> 01:31:33.627
You ever think of all the
people who've had sex in here,

01:31:33.727 --> 01:31:35.924
maybe even on this carpet?

01:31:36.495 --> 01:31:40.009
There was this thing on the news once
where they went in hotel rooms and...

01:31:44.136 --> 01:31:45.601
Johanna?

01:31:46.338 --> 01:31:48.162
Johanna?

01:31:50.276 --> 01:31:51.213
Johanna?

01:31:56.782 --> 01:32:00.318
You could always name it Ken
after my dad if it's a boy, but...

01:32:01.754 --> 01:32:04.256
How about something different?

01:32:05.056 --> 01:32:09.161
- Omar. That's kind of cute, different.
- What if it's a girl?

01:32:09.461 --> 01:32:11.663
Allie's a cute girl name.

01:32:11.763 --> 01:32:16.903
Hey. Guess what. Rachel quit, so you're
looking at the new assistant manager.

01:32:17.503 --> 01:32:20.052
- That's great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna make two bucks more an hour.

01:32:21.807 --> 01:32:24.759
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

01:32:35.653 --> 01:32:37.656
You don't think you
should have another test?

01:32:37.856 --> 01:32:39.218
The kit had two tests.

01:32:44.262 --> 01:32:48.200
What about insurance? Do you know how much
it costs to have a baby in the hospital?

01:32:48.573 --> 01:32:49.362
No.

01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:54.798
I'm just not ready to have to another kid.
I mean, I barely just got my shit together.

01:33:18.529 --> 01:33:21.734
You know that 400 bucks you said you
lost and I said Chloe probably took it?

01:33:21.834 --> 01:33:23.011
I know you took it.

01:33:24.370 --> 01:33:27.240
And I know you probably
spent it on drugs.

01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:31.759
I didn't spent it all on drugs.
You should have told me you knew.

01:33:31.859 --> 01:33:34.284
I was waiting for you to do that.

01:33:35.247 --> 01:33:36.278
And you didn't.

01:33:39.752 --> 01:33:42.422
And then after awhile,
it just... it didn't matter.

01:33:43.022 --> 01:33:46.062
It didn't matter? Gee, thanks.

01:33:49.728 --> 01:33:51.846
You're gonna have to stop, you know.

01:33:55.334 --> 01:33:59.243
- Stop what?
- Whatever it is you take.

01:34:01.941 --> 01:34:04.459
- I hardly touch it.
- I'm not stupid.

01:34:14.719 --> 01:34:16.439
That was it?

01:34:16.739 --> 01:34:18.065
Yeah.

01:34:18.791 --> 01:34:20.628
You're married now?

01:34:20.728 --> 01:34:22.355
Yeah.

01:34:26.831 --> 01:34:29.759
- Here, will you take a picture?
- Yeah.

01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:36.085
Got it.

01:34:45.827 --> 01:34:47.960
Where'd you get that?

01:34:51.623 --> 01:34:55.061
So, that was good, right?
You learned how to paint walls and ceilings,

01:34:55.217 --> 01:34:58.445
pull up carpeting, do grouting,

01:34:58.545 --> 01:35:01.432
and help pick out the tiles.
Cheap labor.

01:35:01.532 --> 01:35:03.736
It's not like solon
was any more glamorous.

01:35:03.836 --> 01:35:05.367
I agree.

01:35:07.506 --> 01:35:10.886
- You'll be okay on the bus?
- Yeah, don't sit next to any weirdos.

01:35:10.986 --> 01:35:12.778
That's impossible.

01:35:16.915 --> 01:35:19.290
Thanks for helping my dad.

01:35:22.572 --> 01:35:25.231
- Have a safe trip.
- Thanks.

01:35:26.025 --> 01:35:27.860
See you soon.

01:35:56.655 --> 01:36:00.692
I don't know why you don't believe me.
I told you, I gave it to the mechanic.

01:36:00.792 --> 01:36:05.254
- All $600?
- Yeah, all $600. Pretty much.

01:36:07.658 --> 01:36:10.321
- I got the receipt somewhere.
- Oh, just wait.

01:36:11.803 --> 01:36:14.409
It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

01:36:15.474 --> 01:36:17.156
I'll take him.

01:36:20.197 --> 01:36:21.013
What's on his face?

01:36:21.113 --> 01:36:24.609
Okay, you ready? We're finally gonna
get this. I think it's magic marker.

01:36:32.358 --> 01:36:37.967
Oh, I just want to bite his little toes off.
Oh, you just look like butter.

01:36:38.367 --> 01:36:40.933
I just want to eat you up.
Yum, yum, yum.

01:36:41.433 --> 01:36:44.824
- Oh, what's that on his face?
- It's lipstick.

01:36:45.871 --> 01:36:47.939
Look at that. What is that? Here.

01:36:48.039 --> 01:36:50.936
Take him. I'll go get us some punch.

01:36:51.543 --> 01:36:53.246
Will you grab the wipes out of there?

01:36:53.346 --> 01:36:58.117
You know, Ken, I've been known
to hold a baby now and then.

01:36:59.217 --> 01:37:01.142
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:37:01.987 --> 01:37:05.925
Yeah, this hand.
Oh, don't wake-up, pumpkin.

01:37:06.025 --> 01:37:08.168
Don't wake-up.

01:37:12.297 --> 01:37:15.934
What about something more piratical?
Engineering?

01:37:16.034 --> 01:37:18.503
I think I'm gonna major in premed,

01:37:18.603 --> 01:37:21.219
and I really want to go to Cornell
for medical school after,

01:37:21.319 --> 01:37:24.895
but I think I'll do a junior year
abroad first, possibly in like France

01:37:24.995 --> 01:37:27.802
or Italy or England,
something like that.

01:37:27.902 --> 01:37:30.149
- Cool.
- Congratulations.

01:37:30.849 --> 01:37:32.125
Thank you.

01:37:32.225 --> 01:37:35.787
I was a history major,
and you see what that got me.

01:37:35.887 --> 01:37:40.002
Yeah, well, I really want to specialize
in dermatology because it allows you

01:37:40.102 --> 01:37:43.729
a pretty good schedule so I can
have kids. I really want a girl.

01:37:43.829 --> 01:37:46.571
So, hopefully I'll be married
by the time I'm 26. That way,

01:37:46.671 --> 01:37:50.337
by the time they go to college, I'll still
have time to, you know, live a little.

01:37:53.205 --> 01:37:55.074
What do you want?

01:37:59.110 --> 01:38:01.526
I have what I want.

01:38:05.951 --> 01:38:07.894
Here. You go up.

01:38:09.822 --> 01:38:11.432
Okay.
