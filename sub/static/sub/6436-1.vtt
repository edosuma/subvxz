WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:11.543
(theme music plays )

00:23.107 --> 00:25.598
( distant cheering )

00:36.579 --> 00:39.616
( crowd chanting faintly )
Kill kill kill!

00:45.338 --> 00:47.329
(rumbling)

00:48.966 --> 00:50.957
( sand pattering )

00:55.640 --> 00:57.631
(timbers thudding)

01:05.942 --> 01:07.978
( cheering intensifies )

01:09.487 --> 01:11.023
( metal blows ringing )

01:12.031 --> 01:14.022
( combatants grunting )

01:22.041 --> 01:24.407
( chuckles )

01:33.970 --> 01:36.256
( roars )

01:44.647 --> 01:46.228
Come on!

01:51.570 --> 01:53.231
Yeah!

01:56.742 --> 01:58.198
( laughs)

02:02.206 --> 02:04.288
( blood pattering )

02:27.106 --> 02:29.597
(shouting, clamoring )

02:31.319 --> 02:33.105
Oh, what do you
know about it?

02:33.279 --> 02:34.234
Be gone!

02:34.405 --> 02:37.112
Hold your fucking tongues!

02:38.367 --> 02:40.608
Let the Roman
have his say!

02:42.663 --> 02:44.494
Thrace and the Republic

02:44.665 --> 02:46.621
have known
their differences.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.078
We've not always been
as brothers.

02:49.253 --> 02:52.745
But let us put aside
such matters,

02:52.923 --> 02:55.335
uniting in just cause.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.465
You pushed your way
into our land

02:57.636 --> 03:00.673
and now you stand
asking for our help,

03:00.848 --> 03:03.965
- your hand extended?
- Men: Yeah!

03:04.143 --> 03:06.259
I extend no hand.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.644
I'm here merely to inform.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.305
Mithridates
and his Greeks

03:11.484 --> 03:14.100
attack from the east
encroaching from the Black Sea.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.439
Far removed
from our villages!

03:16.614 --> 03:18.104
True.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.943
But the Getae

03:20.117 --> 03:22.278
take advantage
of the distraction.

03:22.453 --> 03:25.115
Their barbarian hordes
amass to the north,

03:25.289 --> 03:29.453
barely half a week's march
to your villages.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.993
- How many?
-Thousands.

03:32.171 --> 03:35.459
( men clamoring )

03:35.633 --> 03:37.794
Align yourselves
with Rome,

03:37.968 --> 03:39.833
pledge your service
to the auxiliary

03:40.012 --> 03:41.752
and join us
in our campaign!

03:41.931 --> 03:43.796
- To what end?
- ( clamoring continues)

03:43.974 --> 03:46.135
To what end?!

03:49.146 --> 03:53.014
- Victory.
- And how is it to be measured?

03:53.192 --> 03:56.025
The Getae have raided
our villages in the past,

03:56.195 --> 03:57.981
- raped our women...
- Men: Yeah!

03:58.155 --> 03:59.565
- killed our children.
- Men: Yeah!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.981
Each time we have
pushed them back

04:02.159 --> 04:03.695
only to see them return.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.484
Elder:
He speaks out of turn,

04:05.663 --> 04:07.870
yet the truth falls
from his mouth.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.417
If we are to align
with Rome,

04:10.584 --> 04:13.496
the purpose
must be clear--

04:15.965 --> 04:19.583
the Getae dead,
all of them.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.338
Dead.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.553
- All of them.
- ( men cheering, clamoring )

04:44.493 --> 04:47.360
The council has decided.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.159
We go to war.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.034
I've asked the gods
to bless your sword.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.332
Once the Getae are wiped
from our lands

05:01.510 --> 05:03.296
there'll be no reason
to ever pick it up again.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.336
( scoffs )

05:05.514 --> 05:07.846
What would my husband
do without it in his hands?

05:09.602 --> 05:12.389
Grow crops, raise goats...

05:14.273 --> 05:16.184
make children.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.485
You would
fight no more?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.240
Forever...

05:27.411 --> 05:29.447
to be by your side.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.582
How soon do you march?

05:39.757 --> 05:41.748
First light.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.379
Then come to bed.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.094
If one night
is all we have left,

05:51.268 --> 05:53.429
I shall make
the most of it.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.505
Be strong.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.527
I woke expecting
my wife beside me.

06:43.696 --> 06:45.357
She rose early to pray...

06:48.075 --> 06:49.736
that her husband
would stay with her.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.201
I thought we were
in agreement.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.862
- We were.
- Were?

06:57.376 --> 06:59.116
The gods came to me
last night

06:59.295 --> 07:01.206
in my sleep.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.961
What did they show you?

07:03.132 --> 07:05.123
My husband on his knees

07:05.301 --> 07:08.384
bowing before
a great red serpent,

07:08.554 --> 07:11.967
the life draining
from his veins.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.178
What meaning
did you take from it?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.217
Awarning.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.227
If you go to war,

07:19.398 --> 07:22.060
you are destined for great
and unfortunate things.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.066
The Getae worship
the mountain wolf.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.946
They place no faith
in snakes.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.076
It was just a dream.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.997
- And if it isn't?
- I gave my word, Sura.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.875
Blood and honor.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.537
It speaks to the man.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.043
Nothing will keep me
from returning to your arms--

07:50.220 --> 07:52.506
not the Getae,

07:52.681 --> 07:54.421
not the Romans,

07:54.600 --> 07:56.431
not the gods themselves.

07:56.602 --> 07:59.810
(sighs)

07:59.980 --> 08:02.141
The nights grow so cold.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.432
What am | to do
without you in our bed?

08:07.863 --> 08:09.603
Lift your dress.

08:26.465 --> 08:29.047
Keep me close
to your thighs.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.459
Thethought
will warm us both.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.320
Kill them all.

08:54.118 --> 08:55.483
Foryou.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.900
( yells battle cry )

09:42.374 --> 09:44.410
- ( men grunting)
- ( metallic ringing)

09:54.553 --> 09:56.669
Hold the line!

10:01.560 --> 10:04.097
l'll fuck your women!

10:04.271 --> 10:06.683
l'll fuck them all!

10:11.111 --> 10:13.523
Where the fuck
are the Romans?

10:19.328 --> 10:21.694
Show the cunts no mercy!

11:07.626 --> 11:10.208
Romans, forward!

11:10.379 --> 11:12.745
(horns sounding)

11:16.760 --> 11:18.125
Warrior:
Where you going?

11:18.303 --> 11:20.385
Where are you small cocks
running off to?

11:20.556 --> 11:22.296
A little late!

11:22.474 --> 11:24.760
They'd just
get in the way.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.364
( quiet chatter)

11:53.672 --> 11:56.254
(grumbles)

12:03.056 --> 12:04.887
My own shit
would taste better.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.094
I cook what
they give us, Drenis.

12:07.269 --> 12:10.761
Guts and bones while Glaber
and his Romans feast on meat!

12:10.939 --> 12:12.804
We're the last to eat,

12:12.983 --> 12:14.939
the last to share
in the spoils,

12:15.110 --> 12:18.602
but always the first to be sent
against those barbarian cunts!

12:20.490 --> 12:23.527
Maybe Legatus fucking Glaber
rolls out of his nice warm tent

12:23.702 --> 12:26.193
and finds these Thracian dogs
have returned to the wild...

12:26.371 --> 12:28.487
- Men: Yeah!
- ( throat cleared )

12:28.665 --> 12:31.657
- ( slurps)
- Something to add, little man?

12:31.835 --> 12:34.247
A word.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.036
Which word
might that be?

12:36.214 --> 12:38.421
The one I gave the Romans

12:38.592 --> 12:40.253
and my body
and blood with it.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.668
We all did--
to push the Getae back.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.427
We can defend
our own lands!

12:44.598 --> 12:46.338
We gave our word.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.552
In my village

12:48.727 --> 12:50.342
such a thing
still bears meaning.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.306
Your village?

12:52.481 --> 12:53.937
Is that why
you're here?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.189
To defend
your village?

12:56.360 --> 12:59.193
Maybe you're trying to impress that
sweet taste you're always going on about

12:59.363 --> 13:01.399
- with stories of war.
- ( all chuckle)

13:06.870 --> 13:08.531
Ahh.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.741
Struck the mark near,
did I?

13:12.250 --> 13:15.538
"Words and honor"
my great fat ass.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.499
It all comes back round
to a pair of tits

13:18.674 --> 13:21.211
and a tight
little hole.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.087
Men: Whoa!

13:31.561 --> 13:33.347
( laughs)

13:49.037 --> 13:50.777
Man:
The legatus is here!

13:54.584 --> 13:58.418
The legatus needs volunteers
to scout beyond the forward line.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.756
You, tactical report
by sunrise.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.757
Or go without rations.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.220
"Please" would've done.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.598
We'll finish
this discussion later.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.354
(grunts)

14:24.072 --> 14:26.279
And if we're dead?

14:26.450 --> 14:28.907
Then my boot will find your ass
in the afterlife.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.819
( chuckles )

14:50.974 --> 14:52.339
(squeals happily )

14:52.517 --> 14:54.428
( growls )

15:01.651 --> 15:03.516
- ||iythia.
- What if I'd been an assassin?

15:03.695 --> 15:06.607
I'd be a widow.

15:06.782 --> 15:09.489
What's a respectful period of mourning
before I could remarry?

15:09.659 --> 15:12.571
You overstep.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.702
Women are forbidden
within the encampment.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.114
- l was discreet.
- Ha. You?

15:17.292 --> 15:19.533
Your man helped to whisk me
through the sentries

15:19.711 --> 15:22.703
after I threatened to run
naked through the camp

15:22.881 --> 15:26.089
screaming he laid his hands
on the wife of the legatus.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.847
Does your father
know you're in Thrace?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.679
Please.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.686
He's too busy colluding
with the other corpses in the Senate.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.471
He thinks I'm still lounging

15:41.650 --> 15:43.732
at the villa in Capua.

15:43.902 --> 15:47.019
Far too arid. It hasn't rained there
since last forever.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.693
You should've written.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.607
You would've told me
not to come.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.993
I'm in the middle of a war.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.199
I bought you a gift--

16:00.919 --> 16:02.204
something to
remind you of Rome.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.244
Sesti wine.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.208
Let me fill up your cup

16:06.383 --> 16:09.591
while you tell me
about your little war.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.294
It's too brief a tale.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.760
Mithridates and his army
of Greek whores

16:15.934 --> 16:18.266
press the legion in the east
by the Black Sea.

16:18.436 --> 16:22.679
Here I sit protecting
the northern border

16:22.858 --> 16:24.314
of the land
of piss and shit

16:24.484 --> 16:26.566
from simple
barbarian raiders.

16:27.863 --> 16:29.649
Mithridates.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.279
A victory against him

16:31.449 --> 16:33.405
would have your name
on every Roman's tongue.

16:33.577 --> 16:36.444
Cotta leads the assault.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.236
He steals your laurels.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.656
He's the consul.
Theft is his privilege.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.577
Father will be
disappointed,

16:44.754 --> 16:47.587
for he secured this position
for you to shine.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.294
And here you sit eclipsed.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.675
lam doing what I can.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.931
( giggles )
Of course you are.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.934
| just wish
you were back home.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.345
Father's planning
a full day

17:04.524 --> 17:06.810
of spectacles
and gladiators.

17:06.985 --> 17:08.521
It's the talk
of Capua.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.402
I hadn't realized
elections were nearing.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.905
Never too early
to campaign.

17:15.619 --> 17:17.280
If things
were heading better,

17:17.454 --> 17:19.661
you could be
by his side.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.956
If.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.287
So serious.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.123
Bad for the humours.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.510
Come.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.718
You haven't tasted
your gift yet.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.568
( both moaning )

18:19.266 --> 18:21.257
(gasping )

18:37.242 --> 18:39.733
- They're breaking camp.
- Frightened little gashes,

18:39.911 --> 18:42.493
running away with their cocks
between their cheeks.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.911
Retreat would take them
beyond the mountains to the north.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.202
- Their torches bear west.
- West?

18:50.380 --> 18:52.871
They're swinging around to attack
the villages below the pass...

18:54.884 --> 18:56.044
our villages.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.427
Slippery little cunts.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.930
If they break for
the mountain pass here

19:03.101 --> 19:06.059
it will take them four days at most
to reach the villages below.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.595
Food, supplies, women--

19:08.773 --> 19:10.229
all unprotected.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.938
It's a simple thing
to be turned

19:15.113 --> 19:17.229
in the mountains
at night.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.572
Perhaps I should
send a Roman

19:19.743 --> 19:21.404
to properly assess
the situation.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.990
Send the gods themselves.
They'll report the same.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.330
Dismissed.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.366
If we march by midday,
we can easily--

19:30.545 --> 19:32.752
Dismissed!

19:49.647 --> 19:51.808
The barbarians
head west.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.359
So it appears.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.778
Further yet from Mithridates
and the Greeks

19:55.945 --> 19:58.152
and the glory
you deserve.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.862
Return to Capua.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.783
And my father?

20:07.957 --> 20:11.666
How will he measure the man
he so blessed with his daughter?

20:16.174 --> 20:18.005
A colossus

20:18.176 --> 20:21.384
towering above
the enemies of Rome.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.892
Pompous arrogant
Roman boy-lover.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.145
All but
called us liars!

20:32.315 --> 20:34.431
- How are you certain?
- You heard what he said.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.270
"Turned in the mountains
at night"--

20:36.444 --> 20:38.526
- like he's speaking to children.
- No no, about the boys.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.438
- How do you know he favors them?
- Now who's having a laugh?

20:41.616 --> 20:43.948
There's this tickle
in the back of my throat.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.576
- The cock Glaberjust forced down it.
- Fuck Legatus.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.327
If he wants to send
his own men, let him.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.908
Won't change the direction
the Getae move.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.540
Glaber is the most
dangerous kind of fool--

20:53.795 --> 20:55.831
- one with a title.
- True,

20:56.005 --> 20:59.213
but perhaps he has better sense
when it comes to wine.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.796
- You stole his wine?
- | only borrowed it.

21:02.971 --> 21:06.384
Plan to piss it all back shortly.
( laughs )

21:25.243 --> 21:27.234
(horns sounding)

21:31.249 --> 21:33.706
- Up.
-( groans) Fuck your mother.

21:33.877 --> 21:37.836
- The Romans sound the call.
- Fuck the Romans and their fucking horns.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.871
Join us,
you drunken goat.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.335
The legatus
has gained his senses.

21:42.510 --> 21:45.843
Is there any wine left?

21:46.014 --> 21:47.970
Your belly
holds the sum.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.927
I may return
the balance presently.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.342
How far to the mouth
of the pass?

21:54.856 --> 21:56.687
if we march with meaning.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.645
Drink would spur
my intent.

22:01.279 --> 22:03.110
My village is only
a ways further west.

22:03.281 --> 22:06.318
- My wine is yours after we--
- Man: West?

22:06.493 --> 22:08.700
We march east
to challenge Mithridates.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.327
Byzo.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.329
Did the legatus send his own men
to scout the front?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.990
How the fuck
should I know?

22:15.168 --> 22:18.080
They blow their fucking horns,
a Roman dog barks

22:18.254 --> 22:19.915
and the gods shit on me.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.421
Welcome to
the fucking auxiliary.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.846
A word, Legatus.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.889
Move to formation!

22:40.068 --> 22:41.933
We advance east!

22:42.111 --> 22:45.319
Sure you mean west
as the Getae advance.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.903
Mithridates and the Greeks
are of pressing concern.

22:50.328 --> 22:52.410
You have allied
yourself with Rome.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.617
I am its body and voice.

22:55.792 --> 22:59.535
We march east
to the Black Sea.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.623
Fall into formation.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.042
Fall into formation!

23:10.515 --> 23:11.971
No.

23:14.602 --> 23:17.719
You would defy an order
from your legatus?

23:17.897 --> 23:20.559
I gave my word to defend
against the Getae,

23:20.733 --> 23:23.725
not to march east
to attack Mithridates.

23:23.903 --> 23:27.111
You will march
where you are commanded!

23:35.999 --> 23:37.535
Kill them!

23:39.210 --> 23:41.246
Wait wait!

23:45.717 --> 23:46.923
(yells)

24:01.733 --> 24:04.566
- Ha!
- Throw, damn you!

24:20.877 --> 24:23.869
What have you done,
you stupid shit?

24:24.047 --> 24:26.459
He did what he had to.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.670
Break and go your way,
west if your lives are there.

24:29.844 --> 24:32.085
If not,
I could give a fuck.

24:32.263 --> 24:33.173
( growls )

24:34.432 --> 24:35.717
What of the legatus?

24:38.936 --> 24:40.597
Leave him in the mud.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.185
(grunts)

25:12.261 --> 25:14.252
( heavy footsteps )

25:27.610 --> 25:29.066
( cries out )

25:30.738 --> 25:32.774
(screaming, yelling)

25:50.425 --> 25:52.416
(grunts)

26:03.730 --> 26:05.516
(yells)

26:43.770 --> 26:45.260
( loud squelch )

27:02.580 --> 27:05.367
( distant cries )

27:05.541 --> 27:07.532
The village.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.702
(screaming, wailing)

27:17.762 --> 27:21.050
We have to go.
Now.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.977
( cricket chirping )

27:37.323 --> 27:39.188
(bird calls)

27:43.621 --> 27:45.612
They haven't followed.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.926
You were right.

28:05.101 --> 28:07.137
Inever
should have left.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.853
You had
given your word.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.640
The fault lies with the Romans
in breaking theirs.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.026
You're hurt.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.065
- It's nothing.
- Let me see.

28:23.244 --> 28:25.200
- Sura.
- ( sternly ) Let me see.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.325
Your tone is disquieting.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.831
You should be
used to it by now.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.042
I'm all right.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.629
Of course you are.

28:44.807 --> 28:46.593
Hold still.

28:48.561 --> 28:50.222
( cloth tears )

29:01.073 --> 29:02.984
It's gone, isn't it--

29:04.285 --> 29:05.900
the village--

29:06.078 --> 29:08.330
everyone we knew?

29:10.333 --> 29:12.824
We'll move south.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.369
I had people there once.

29:18.341 --> 29:20.047
The Getae won't
venture that far,

29:20.217 --> 29:22.833
not to the risk of thinning
their numbers.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.635
And the Romans?

29:31.729 --> 29:34.721
Their concern rests against
Mithridates to the east.

29:38.486 --> 29:41.228
South it is.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.156
lwish I had been
a thousand men.

30:03.886 --> 30:05.877
You did
what you could.

30:07.139 --> 30:10.131
You came back
for me...

30:12.770 --> 30:15.182
knowing it could
mean your life.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.653
There is no life
without you.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.247
( horse snorts)

32:09.887 --> 32:12.845
(screaming )

32:40.918 --> 32:42.658
My tribune dead,

32:42.837 --> 32:44.077
half the auxiliary
deserted,

32:44.255 --> 32:46.541
now orders recalling
me to Rome...

32:46.715 --> 32:49.707
- all from your hand.
- I own my actions,

32:49.885 --> 32:53.093
- but my wife--
- Has been condemned to slavery,

32:53.264 --> 32:55.596
courtesy
of her husband.

32:55.766 --> 32:59.133
No no no!

33:00.855 --> 33:03.562
The shadow of Rome is vast.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.688
And you, Thracian,

33:05.860 --> 33:09.728
will die under it.

33:18.122 --> 33:21.330
( cacophony )

33:33.554 --> 33:35.795
Good of you
to join us.

33:35.973 --> 33:37.509
Thought you were dead
there for a while.

33:37.683 --> 33:41.392
He smells dead.
Stupid fuck.

33:41.562 --> 33:46.147
- Argh! Ahh!
- Drenis: Easy easy!

33:46.317 --> 33:48.478
You've been out for days.

33:48.652 --> 33:54.613
- ( waves crashing )
- We're at sea?

33:54.783 --> 33:57.946
Upon the Adriatic,

33:58.120 --> 33:59.360
bound for Capua.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.403
Sura.

34:02.750 --> 34:06.413
- Your woman?
- The Romans took her.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.251
Best to forget her then.

34:11.425 --> 34:13.416
(waves crashing )

34:42.665 --> 34:44.656
( gasps )

34:48.963 --> 34:51.079
What if I'd been
an assassin?

34:51.257 --> 34:54.215
( giggles )
Father's in town.

34:54.385 --> 34:57.297
- He'll be back shortly.
- How shortly?

34:58.430 --> 35:00.295
He's not very happy
with you.

35:01.892 --> 35:05.430
- And his daughter?
- She missed her husband...

35:07.606 --> 35:10.939
but fears his reappearance
has come too soon.

35:14.822 --> 35:17.689
The games your father presents
the people of Capua...

35:17.866 --> 35:19.481
They begin tomorrow.

35:19.660 --> 35:22.902
- The feast is tonight?
- That's to his purpose in town.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.787
lwould have
a word with him.

35:25.958 --> 35:30.076
It will take more than one
to regain his favor.

35:31.714 --> 35:33.204
The Senate chamber
is full of whispers

35:33.382 --> 35:37.751
overyour
early return.

35:40.723 --> 35:43.135
Cheers of the crowd
will still their tongues.

35:43.309 --> 35:47.803
Cheers? How will you draw them,
short of victory?

35:47.980 --> 35:50.972
By giving them something
few have ever seen:

35:52.401 --> 35:55.609
Thracian blood
spilled in the arena.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.942
Win the hearts
of the crowd...

35:59.116 --> 36:03.860
And the Senate
will beg to follow.

36:04.038 --> 36:06.279
Man:
Get out of my sight!

36:06.457 --> 36:08.413
lnbred shitwhores.

36:08.584 --> 36:11.075
I should sell the lot of you
to the mines.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.335
- Out!
- Father's returned.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.496
And in a fine state.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.881
If he refuses
to aid my intentions--

36:20.471 --> 36:22.928
when pleaded
with teary eye.

36:25.142 --> 36:28.726
(music playing )

36:41.533 --> 36:44.024
( guests applaud,
cheer)

36:48.791 --> 36:50.577
Good citizens of Capua,

36:50.751 --> 36:52.616
revered guests,

36:52.795 --> 36:54.660
a debt of gratitude
for partaking

36:54.838 --> 36:57.875
in this celebration
of the family name Albinius.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.757
( cheering )
Albinius! Albinius!

37:03.013 --> 37:06.551
Your attendance honors
the memory of my elders,

37:06.725 --> 37:09.683
gone too soon from
the realm of the living...

37:09.853 --> 37:11.935
and the joy of a daughter,

37:12.106 --> 37:14.688
yet so full of life.

37:14.858 --> 37:19.943
l repay your kindness
with gifts of water,

37:20.114 --> 37:23.231
carried from Rome where the gods
have seen fit to keep the drought at bay,

37:23.409 --> 37:28.028
and gifts of blood
to be spilled in the arena!

37:28.205 --> 37:32.369
( guests cheer)

37:32.543 --> 37:35.376
Quintus Lentulus Batiatus!

37:35.546 --> 37:39.130
- Step forward.
- ( guests cheer, applaud )

37:47.599 --> 37:49.214
Present your gladiators.

37:52.646 --> 37:56.059
In honor of Senator Albinius
and the people of Capua,

37:56.233 --> 37:59.896
I give you Barca,
the beast of Carthage!

38:00.070 --> 38:03.028
( guests cheers )

38:03.198 --> 38:08.033
Yet his ferocity pales
against the titan of the arena--

38:08.203 --> 38:10.819
the god
of blood and sand!

38:10.998 --> 38:14.911
Crixus
the undefeated Gaul!

38:18.797 --> 38:21.539
Gratitude to Batiatus!

38:30.684 --> 38:35.303
And now to
Marcus Decius Solonius

38:35.481 --> 38:37.017
and his offerings!

38:37.191 --> 38:39.398
( guests cheer)

38:43.405 --> 38:46.238
In honor of Senator Albinius

38:46.408 --> 38:48.524
and the people of Capua,

38:48.702 --> 38:50.943
I give you six
of my finest men!

38:51.121 --> 38:55.535
Behold Ark Adios,
scourge of Athens!

38:58.504 --> 39:00.460
Preening shit eater.

39:00.631 --> 39:03.122
A mockery
to the profession.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.382
- A mockery is it?
- Oh, you disagree?

39:05.552 --> 39:07.133
Let it pass.

39:07.304 --> 39:09.590
We're guests
of the senator.

39:09.765 --> 39:12.928
He's invited us to sit
in the pulvinus tomorrow.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.638
That's consolation.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.723
Only two of my men have been
retained to fight in tomorrow's games

39:17.898 --> 39:19.434
while Solonius
secures half a dozen

39:19.608 --> 39:22.600
of his ill-trained
simians.

39:22.778 --> 39:26.566
(sighs ) That man has fingers
in all the proper assholes.

39:26.740 --> 39:29.322
He wiggles them
and everyone shits gold.

39:29.493 --> 39:32.155
(clapping )

39:32.329 --> 39:34.285
Gratitude to Solonius!

39:36.041 --> 39:40.125
Water and games
are distant praise for the city

39:40.295 --> 39:42.286
that has held the name
Albinius as its own.

39:42.464 --> 39:47.049
More is deserved!
And the gods have seen fit

39:47.219 --> 39:49.835
to deliver it in the form of my
daughter's husband--

39:50.013 --> 39:53.426
Legatus Claudius Glaber...

39:53.600 --> 39:55.181
- ( guests cheer)
- ...newly returned

39:55.352 --> 39:57.058
from the savage lands
of Thrace!

39:57.229 --> 40:00.562
( guests cheer,
applaud )

40:13.954 --> 40:17.788
More gifts for
the people of Capua!

40:17.958 --> 40:21.826
Six Thracian jackals!

40:22.004 --> 40:25.838
Deserters from the war
against the barbaric Getae...

40:27.175 --> 40:32.340
to be executed ad gladium
in tomorrow's games!

40:32.514 --> 40:34.220
( guests cheer,
applaud )

40:34.391 --> 40:37.007
-We||?
- Hm!

40:45.777 --> 40:50.066
- He is well received.
- Ask favor for him again

40:50.240 --> 40:52.697
and your tears will
fall short of notice.

40:52.868 --> 40:57.658
Right. Now to more music
and drink! Hm!

40:57.831 --> 40:59.787
( music plays)

41:10.594 --> 41:13.131
Thracians.
Between those animals

41:13.305 --> 41:15.045
and Solonius's
inferior offerings,

41:15.223 --> 41:16.429
a mockery
on all accounting.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.136
Glaber mentions execution.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.265
Perhaps a word could
lend our men to the task.

41:19.436 --> 41:22.018
The position
has been occupied.

41:22.189 --> 41:26.023
Good Solonius!
l was just marveling at your wares!

41:26.193 --> 41:28.024
Oh and l at yours.

41:28.195 --> 41:31.278
- Oh, you flatter.
- No, I appreciate.

41:31.448 --> 41:34.281
Good to lay eyes,
old friend.

41:34.451 --> 41:36.487
I feared for a time
you would be excluded.

41:36.662 --> 41:40.246
Games absent Batiatus?
A dawn without the sun.

41:40.415 --> 41:42.280
Ah, Crixus and Barca.

41:42.459 --> 41:44.825
Two fine entries.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.745
They should provide distraction
between the more important bouts.

41:50.467 --> 41:53.049
The senator beckons.

41:53.220 --> 41:56.053
If I miss you at the games
tomorrow, Lucretia...

41:56.223 --> 41:58.430
Well it's unlikely. We've been
invited to sit in the pulvinus.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.307
The pulvinus?
With the senator?

42:01.478 --> 42:04.185
A great honor.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.221
l'll enjoy
your company there.

42:09.903 --> 42:11.439
I shall witness his
heart on a day,

42:11.613 --> 42:13.649
parted from
his chest.

42:13.824 --> 42:16.611
And I shall grip
the knife.

42:59.244 --> 43:02.782
I've never beheld
such sights.

43:02.956 --> 43:05.538
Nor will you again.

43:38.283 --> 43:41.741
( crowd roars distantly )

43:43.371 --> 43:44.406
( lock clatters )

44:14.903 --> 44:16.484
( crowd roars )

44:34.631 --> 44:36.212
( chuckles )

44:36.383 --> 44:39.045
(yells)

44:50.397 --> 44:52.353
(gurgling)

45:02.909 --> 45:05.491
- Gladiator: Ha ha!
- ( crowd cheering )

45:34.482 --> 45:35.858
The crowd approves
his gifts.

45:36.026 --> 45:38.062
As do we all.

45:38.236 --> 45:41.524
l've withheld something
of note for the last.

45:47.078 --> 45:49.069
(trumpets sound )

45:53.710 --> 45:55.450
(crowd murmurs)

46:06.514 --> 46:08.095
( panting )

46:11.186 --> 46:13.848
Ready,
Thracian cunt?

46:16.107 --> 46:17.222
( gates open )

46:31.706 --> 46:33.242
Yaaah!

46:33.416 --> 46:35.498
( crowd booing )

46:38.296 --> 46:40.287
( crowd roars
disapproval )

46:45.136 --> 46:46.592
The odds seem
out of favor.

46:46.763 --> 46:50.255
This Thracian caused Rome
a great disservice, Father.

46:50.433 --> 46:53.095
His cowardice
led to mass desertion.

46:53.269 --> 46:55.931
ls his life
not ample repayment?

46:56.106 --> 46:58.813
He must be humiliated
in example.

46:58.984 --> 47:03.694
Solonius was kind enough to offer
his services in this act.

47:07.742 --> 47:08.902
( crowd boos )

47:09.077 --> 47:11.409
(sighs)

47:11.579 --> 47:12.614
Give the command.

47:50.535 --> 47:51.991
( cries out )

47:54.581 --> 47:56.321
(yells)

47:57.667 --> 47:59.248
(grunts)

48:21.024 --> 48:24.687
( laughs)

48:24.861 --> 48:26.567
( booing )

48:28.073 --> 48:31.861
- ( softly ) A mockery.
- Be still.

48:37.540 --> 48:40.828
( snake hisses )

48:41.002 --> 48:43.584
( heavy breathing )

48:45.757 --> 48:47.588
- ( growls)
- ( Sura's voice echoing ) Kill them all.

48:54.015 --> 48:55.755
Yaah!

48:59.813 --> 49:03.397
Yaah!

49:14.202 --> 49:16.409
( cries out )

49:59.956 --> 50:03.244
( crowd chanting )
Kill kill kill kill!

50:32.864 --> 50:35.321
( chanting )
Live live live live live!

50:51.299 --> 50:54.416
Well, this presents
some difficulty.

50:54.594 --> 50:56.425
The sentence
of death holds.

50:56.596 --> 50:58.712
But to defy the wishes
of the crowd,

50:58.890 --> 51:01.677
it's unwise,
even for a senator.

51:01.851 --> 51:04.763
He gave me grievance!
I will not see him freed!

51:04.938 --> 51:06.553
A solution, perhaps--

51:06.731 --> 51:09.438
if you will entertain,
Legatus?

51:09.609 --> 51:11.065
The Thracian has shown
promise in the arena,

51:11.236 --> 51:14.228
albeit against Solonius's
inferior stock.

51:14.405 --> 51:17.522
l have a batch of new recruits
arriving tomorrow.

51:17.700 --> 51:19.565
If I were to purchase
this man in addition

51:19.744 --> 51:22.702
to be trained at my ludus
in the gladiatorial arts,

51:22.872 --> 51:27.036
why in his condition, I doubt
he'll survive to the quarter moon.

51:31.589 --> 51:33.875
( chanting continues)
Live live live live live!

51:34.050 --> 51:35.790
We will be
merciful, hmm?

51:35.969 --> 51:38.836
And by such,
gain the favor you seek.

51:42.183 --> 51:44.595
What name
does the man carry?

51:44.769 --> 51:46.976
I never cared to ask.

51:48.398 --> 51:50.889
Batiatus:
The way he fights--

51:51.067 --> 51:53.274
like the legend
of the Thracian king of old.

51:57.782 --> 51:59.864
Spartacus he was called.

52:05.498 --> 52:07.409
( crowd quiets )

52:11.629 --> 52:13.494
People of Capua,

52:13.673 --> 52:17.837
this man,
this Spartacus,

52:18.011 --> 52:21.174
has proven himself
in the arena.

52:21.347 --> 52:24.760
For this, Legatus
Claudius Glaber and l

52:24.934 --> 52:28.472
grant him life.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.682
( cheering )

52:35.111 --> 52:36.442
( chanting )
Spartacus!

52:36.612 --> 52:38.648
Spartacus, Spartacus!

52:38.823 --> 52:41.155
Spartacus,
Spartacus!

52:41.326 --> 52:43.442
( chanting continues)

53:06.601 --> 53:08.592
(theme music playing )
