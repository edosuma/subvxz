WEBVTT

00:27.333 --> 00:29.333
His condition is stable now.

00:29.833 --> 00:31.125
But to be safe,

00:31.208 --> 00:33.083
we'll observe him for another two hours.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.416
If everything's okay,

00:34.500 --> 00:37.000
an ambulance can take him
to a hospital in Taipei.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.833
-Thank you, doctor.
-Thank you, doctor.

00:47.666 --> 00:48.750
I'm sorry.

00:50.458 --> 00:52.958
I shouldn't have brought Ke-le
to such a far place.

00:54.208 --> 00:55.458
No.

00:56.458 --> 00:59.125
I was the one who didn't control
Ke-le's mood well.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.250
But when I saw him having so much fun,

01:04.333 --> 01:05.875
I couldn't bear to stop him.

01:08.916 --> 01:10.083
It's all my fault.

01:11.958 --> 01:14.708
I didn't give him
a good body from the start.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.208
It's not your fault.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.000
I'm sorry.

01:29.416 --> 01:30.958
<i>Unknowingly,</i>

01:31.958 --> 01:33.625
<i>I realized that my care and concern</i>

01:34.125 --> 01:36.291
<i>is far beyond my imagination.</i>

01:38.291 --> 01:39.333
<i>K.</i>

01:39.958 --> 01:41.666
<i>Can you tell me</i>

01:41.750 --> 01:43.541
<i>what exactly should I do</i>

01:44.166 --> 01:46.166
<i>to stop this longing?</i>

02:00.208 --> 02:01.291
Hey.

02:01.375 --> 02:03.166
<i>Hi, Wang Po-han.</i>

02:03.250 --> 02:04.375
<i>I'm back.</i>

02:04.458 --> 02:06.666
<i>I heard that you're looking for me?</i>

02:12.125 --> 02:15.708
VARIATION

02:17.750 --> 02:18.583
That's right.

02:18.666 --> 02:21.375
I was the one who sent the demo
of "The Saddest Thing" to your company.

02:36.833 --> 02:38.000
Why didn't you just give me

02:38.083 --> 02:39.750
the copyright transfer
of the demo as well?

02:42.125 --> 02:44.083
I was going to take it there myself

02:44.166 --> 02:45.500
to give you a surprise.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.708
But who would know?

02:46.791 --> 02:48.416
When Mr. Chi and I
played mahjong the other day,

02:48.500 --> 02:49.625
he kept winning

02:49.708 --> 02:51.250
and winning.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.125
I got mad and went to Kenting.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.833
No, my dear.

02:55.916 --> 02:57.791
I gave you all the money back.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.583
-Don't be mad anymore.
-Stop it.

02:59.666 --> 03:02.375
Since it's a nice song,
why wait three years to give it to us?

03:02.458 --> 03:03.625
You're such a nag!

03:03.708 --> 03:05.750
I do things based on my mood.

03:05.833 --> 03:08.208
Anyway, you're the producer of A-Lin now.

03:08.291 --> 03:12.000
So please let A-Lin
record this song right away.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.166
Last time, didn't a girl come with you?

03:18.250 --> 03:19.916
Why didn't she come today?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.583
She's busy today.

03:21.666 --> 03:23.250
I see, is that so?

03:25.958 --> 03:28.375
I just got lucky that day.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.625
Lucky? Why didn't you give in to me?

03:30.708 --> 03:31.666
I'm telling you. I did.

03:31.750 --> 03:34.083
If I didn't,
things wouldn't have come to this.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.833
CHENG EN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

03:48.458 --> 03:49.708
What are you doing?

03:54.458 --> 03:57.750
Mr. Wang, I can't find it.

03:58.791 --> 04:00.333
What can't you find?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.333
The other world.

04:04.916 --> 04:06.208
What address should I put in?

04:09.791 --> 04:11.208
Why are you looking for that?

04:13.958 --> 04:15.416
If I'm not around anymore,

04:15.916 --> 04:17.708
can you help me take care of An Yi-chi?

04:19.541 --> 04:20.625
Don't talk nonsense.

04:20.708 --> 04:23.250
After your surgery in a couple of days,
you'll be fine.

04:23.333 --> 04:24.791
You can take care of her yourself.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.916
But what if I still don't get well?

04:29.875 --> 04:31.833
Every time I undergo surgery,

04:31.916 --> 04:33.708
that's what An Yi-chi says.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.666
But after each surgery,
I still don't get well.

04:39.791 --> 04:40.791
It's different this time.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.875
You'll keep getting better.

04:42.958 --> 04:44.500
In the end, you'll be completely well.

04:46.583 --> 04:47.666
Mr. Wang.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.708
I don't dare to tell my mom.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.125
I'm afraid that she would feel bad.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.833
I'm really scared.

05:03.541 --> 05:05.333
I'm afraid that if I don't get well,

05:06.208 --> 05:08.333
I'll go straight to the other world.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.875
Then I'll never be able
to see my mom again.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.541
I'll never see you again either.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.958
I don't know
what it's like in the other world.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.541
I would definitely get lost.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.541
I wouldn't know
how to get home to see you two.

05:26.625 --> 05:27.500
Don't worry.

05:28.416 --> 05:29.916
You're so naughty.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.916
God wouldn't want you, you know?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.791
I want to be with my mom forever.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.583
I know.

05:45.666 --> 05:47.166
It's going to be fine.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.083
You'll get better.

05:58.041 --> 06:01.166
I want to be with my mom forever.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.250
I…

06:27.000 --> 06:28.458
I'm planning to go out.

06:28.541 --> 06:30.000
I wanted to tell Ke-le.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.500
You're making another delivery?

06:36.791 --> 06:39.041
This is the last delivery for today.

06:39.125 --> 06:40.791
Quit that job later.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.666
Po-han, I swear I won't let it
affect my work at the office.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.750
I really need to make money.

06:46.833 --> 06:47.875
I know.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.541
I got you half a year's salary in advance.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.541
The Finance Department should wire it
to you this afternoon.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.125
But half a year of my salary can't…

06:55.208 --> 06:56.833
Not yours, mine.

06:59.541 --> 07:00.625
Your salary?

07:00.708 --> 07:02.208
Then all the more…

07:02.291 --> 07:04.458
-I can't pay you back.
-You can take care of Ke-le

07:04.541 --> 07:05.666
with your salary first.

07:06.416 --> 07:08.666
You can figure out a way
to pay me back after he recovers.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.291
Go and see him.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.500
Thank you.

07:22.416 --> 07:23.333
Thank you.

07:24.750 --> 07:25.750
Go.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.500
Dad.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.125
Mr. Yang, are you hungry?

07:49.875 --> 07:52.583
This place's food is incredibly delicious.

07:52.666 --> 07:54.125
They're my favorite.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.375
For you.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.416
How am I supposed to eat them?

08:10.500 --> 08:11.750
I usually do it this way.

08:16.041 --> 08:17.333
Have some fries.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.750
-You're Yuan-yuan?
-Yes.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.583
-She is Sung Yuan-yuan.
-Sung Yuan-yuan.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.916
That's a pretty name.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.916
<i>He has proposed to me.</i>

09:03.541 --> 09:05.083
Are these photos good?

09:05.166 --> 09:06.208
They're not!

09:06.291 --> 09:07.958
This one is bad. This one is bad too.

09:08.041 --> 09:09.375
None of them are good.

09:09.458 --> 09:10.458
Is the photographer blind?

09:10.541 --> 09:12.291
He didn't take the photos well at all.

09:12.375 --> 09:13.875
Cindy. Get Cindy to take the photos.

09:13.958 --> 09:15.500
I already asked Cindy.

09:15.583 --> 09:17.333
She rejected it immediately.

09:17.416 --> 09:20.000
My goodness. How cocky.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.041
Don't give her any work.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.541
From now on,
she won't be able to get business from us.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.416
-Okay.
-How cocky.

09:26.250 --> 09:27.666
SENDER: CHANG CHE-KAI,
SUBJECT: RESIGNATION LETTER

09:32.416 --> 09:34.083
Hey, K. You sent me an email?

09:35.583 --> 09:37.541
Why did you send me a resignation letter?

09:37.625 --> 09:39.000
You're quitting?

09:41.250 --> 09:42.916
Why are you quitting?

09:44.458 --> 09:45.583
What's going on?

09:48.791 --> 09:49.875
Mr. Chi.

09:49.958 --> 09:51.291
I'm sorry.

09:52.291 --> 09:53.666
I'm a bit tired these days.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.000
I want to take some time off.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.750
If you're tired, just take time off.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.500
I'll approve it. Why are you quitting?

10:00.166 --> 10:01.333
No.

10:01.416 --> 10:02.916
I want to leave Taipei

10:03.000 --> 10:04.166
and travel somewhere.

10:05.166 --> 10:06.416
Why is this so sudden?

10:07.208 --> 10:08.625
I'm sorry, Mr. Chi.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.458
I've been planning this for a long time.

10:11.125 --> 10:12.666
I hope you can agree.

10:19.041 --> 10:20.166
I'm almost done.

10:20.666 --> 10:22.541
You can ask Pang
if you have any questions in the future.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.416
Everyone is very enthusiastic.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.541
Okay.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.916
What are your future plans?

10:27.833 --> 10:28.791
I have no idea.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.375
I'll probably take a vacation.

10:31.541 --> 10:33.166
It's good to take a vacation.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.583
When you get back,
let's write songs together again.

10:36.708 --> 10:37.833
Sure.

10:38.750 --> 10:39.708
Bye.

10:39.791 --> 10:40.833
-Bye.
-Bye.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.416
May I ask where Chang Che-kai is?

11:12.500 --> 11:13.541
911.

11:19.708 --> 11:20.833
Where's Chang Che-kai?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.708
Why are you here?

11:31.791 --> 11:33.166
Of course I have to come.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.250
You collapsed outside of the office.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.500
If your doctor didn't call me,

11:36.583 --> 11:38.291
how would I know that you're hospitalized?

11:40.083 --> 11:41.125
My goodness.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.416
It's nothing.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.166
Then why are you in the hospital?

11:48.250 --> 11:49.625
What exactly is wrong with you?

11:50.291 --> 11:52.708
The doctor said that there are
many types of congenital anemia.

11:52.791 --> 11:54.416
So I must be hospitalized
for some examinations.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.333
I can get discharged soon.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.083
You have congenital anemia?

11:59.166 --> 12:00.625
Why didn't I know?

12:07.458 --> 12:08.541
Just now,

12:08.625 --> 12:09.791
the examination results came out.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.500
It's nothing serious.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.875
It's mostly because
he has been quite tired lately.

12:14.958 --> 12:16.458
Maybe it's a calcium deficiency.

12:16.541 --> 12:17.958
That was why he fainted.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.375
As long as he gets proper rest,

12:19.458 --> 12:21.791
anemia won't affect his life much.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.333
You have calcium deficiency?

12:24.916 --> 12:26.458
We eat and drink the same things.

12:26.541 --> 12:28.166
Why are you calcium deficient,
and I'm not?

12:28.833 --> 12:30.125
You eat more.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.333
You little pig.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.916
You're the pig.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.333
How can you go abroad
when you're not healthy?

12:36.916 --> 12:38.916
Take calcium supplements every day
from now on.

12:39.000 --> 12:39.875
Do you hear me?

12:40.875 --> 12:41.791
Fine.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.833
You're getting married,
yet you're still so fierce.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.416
I quit my job

12:45.500 --> 12:47.083
so I can rest more.

13:06.791 --> 13:07.625
Hey.

13:09.916 --> 13:11.125
What do you think?

13:11.208 --> 13:12.333
Do I look pretty?

13:27.666 --> 13:28.625
You're very beautiful.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.250
The groom can try on his attire too.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.500
There's no need,

13:35.583 --> 13:36.625
I'm not the groom.

13:36.708 --> 13:38.958
Come on. Try it on for me.

13:41.333 --> 13:42.500
Hurry up. Quit stalling.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.416
-Come on, hurry!
-This way, please.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.083
I told you.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.291
You look so handsome.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.333
Let me take a photo of you guys.

14:04.541 --> 14:05.541
Sure.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.125
You look so handsome.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.166
Ready?

14:12.125 --> 14:14.708
Three, two, one.

14:39.791 --> 14:40.833
Wait for me.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.833
I'll change to the next dress.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.708
Wait for me over there.

14:46.666 --> 14:47.708
Wait for me.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.416
Good boy. It's going to be fine.

18:48.750 --> 18:49.958
Ms. An.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.541
We're going in.

18:51.625 --> 18:52.958
Okay.

18:53.791 --> 18:55.708
Be good, Ke-le. I'll wait for you here.

18:55.791 --> 18:59.333
Mom, I won't disappoint you this time
for sure.

19:01.416 --> 19:02.750
I won't be disappointed.

19:02.833 --> 19:03.916
You can do it.

19:04.625 --> 19:05.666
All the best.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.541
You can do it, Ke-le.

19:20.958 --> 19:24.500
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

19:45.958 --> 19:47.333
Why are you here?

19:48.250 --> 19:50.000
Didn't I tell you
that I can manage by myself?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.000
But I can't.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.250
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

20:17.583 --> 20:21.541
AN KE-LE, SURGERY IN PROGRESS,
PATIENT RECORD 03**26

20:31.916 --> 20:34.125
Dr. Hsieh, how is Ke-le doing?

20:34.958 --> 20:36.583
The surgery is over.

20:36.666 --> 20:38.625
But Ke-le's heartbeat isn't that steady.

20:38.708 --> 20:41.291
I'm going to try
and stabilize it with medication.

20:41.375 --> 20:43.375
But the efficacy
of the medication is limited.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.000
It will depend
on Ke-le's health condition.

20:45.083 --> 20:46.041
I'll observe him again.

20:46.958 --> 20:49.041
Then, what if…

20:49.125 --> 20:51.333
What if the medication can't stabilize it?

20:52.958 --> 20:55.583
If it can't be stabilized by medication
in the end,

20:57.333 --> 20:59.083
you might need to prepare yourselves.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.458
I'm sorry.

21:22.958 --> 21:23.958
Ke-le.

21:24.041 --> 21:24.875
Ke-le.

21:25.708 --> 21:26.833
Ke-le, you're awake. Ke-le.

21:26.916 --> 21:29.333
You did great. Ke-le.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.083
Ke-le, you were awesome.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.500
What's the matter? Do you want to speak?

21:34.583 --> 21:35.791
Or are you thirsty?

21:35.875 --> 21:36.958
Do you want some water?

21:37.041 --> 21:37.916
Give me a second.

21:38.666 --> 21:39.833
Do you want some water?

21:39.916 --> 21:42.708
-I'll get some water, okay?
-Here, Ke-le.

21:51.250 --> 21:52.416
"Dis…"

21:57.958 --> 21:59.250
"…appointed."

21:59.333 --> 22:00.541
Disappointed?

22:03.166 --> 22:04.083
No.

22:04.666 --> 22:05.583
I'm not disappointed.

22:05.666 --> 22:07.000
You did a good job.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.500
You were great, and I'm not disappointed.

22:09.583 --> 22:12.000
Ke-le, you're my idol now.

22:18.708 --> 22:19.750
"Ice…"

22:22.208 --> 22:23.333
"Cre…"

22:24.583 --> 22:25.416
"…am."

22:26.125 --> 22:27.708
Do you want to eat ice cream?

22:27.791 --> 22:29.791
If so, you have to get better soon.

22:29.875 --> 22:33.041
I'll take you for ice cream
when you get discharged, okay?

22:40.416 --> 22:43.583
"Add…"

22:49.625 --> 22:50.541
"…ress."

22:51.125 --> 22:52.083
Address?

22:52.166 --> 22:53.208
Which address do you want to go to?

22:53.291 --> 22:54.375
Where do you want to go?

22:56.666 --> 22:57.625
Where do you want to go?

22:57.708 --> 22:58.791
Tell me.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.458
Point it out to me.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.250
Point it out to me.

23:05.666 --> 23:08.291
Mr. Wang, I can't find it.

23:09.208 --> 23:10.666
The other world.

23:11.583 --> 23:13.208
I'm afraid that if I don't get well,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.500
I'll go straight to the other world.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.875
<i>I would definitely get lost.</i>

23:18.958 --> 23:21.375
<i>-I wouldn't know how to get home.</i>
-What's wrong?

23:21.458 --> 23:23.125
What's wrong? Where? Where are you going?

23:23.208 --> 23:25.333
-Tell me. I'll take you.
-Excuse me. We're going to do an exam.

23:25.416 --> 23:27.041
-Please wait outside.
-I won't know if you don't tell me.

23:27.125 --> 23:29.375
Where do you want to go?
Where are you going, Ke-le?

23:29.458 --> 23:30.500
What's wrong?

23:30.583 --> 23:32.000
-Don't cry.
-Please wait outside.

23:32.083 --> 23:33.666
Let them examine him first, An Yi-chi.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.916
Okay. Get examined first, Ke-le.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.208
Get examined first. Wait here for me.

23:42.291 --> 23:43.458
I'll be back later.

23:44.375 --> 23:45.333
Okay. Be good.

23:45.416 --> 23:46.500
I love you.

23:47.083 --> 23:48.125
Wait for us.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.000
Since Ke-le is already awake,

24:14.083 --> 24:15.625
he should be fine.

24:17.416 --> 24:18.958
Don't worry too much.

24:19.041 --> 24:19.875
Okay.

24:32.208 --> 24:33.291
Ke-le!

24:36.583 --> 24:38.625
-Ke-le!
-The doctor is giving emergency treatment.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.750
-I'm sorry. You can't enter. Wait outside.
-An Yi-chi.

24:40.833 --> 24:42.375
-Ke-le!
-Prepare for defibrillation.

24:42.458 --> 24:43.416
-An Yi-chi!
-I'm sorry.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.416
Ke-le!

24:45.500 --> 24:47.375
Ke-le! Let me go!

24:47.458 --> 24:48.583
Ke-le!

24:49.125 --> 24:50.083
Ke-le!

24:50.166 --> 24:52.541
Save my Ke-le!

24:54.625 --> 24:55.666
Ke-le!

24:56.583 --> 24:58.458
Ke-le!

25:02.958 --> 25:04.166
<i>An Yi-chi.</i>

25:05.291 --> 25:08.291
<i>I do remember our address very well.</i>

25:09.458 --> 25:11.041
<i>But write it down for me</i>

25:11.125 --> 25:12.875
<i>and put it in my pocket, okay?</i>

25:15.708 --> 25:18.166
<i>This way, no matter how far
the other world is,</i>

25:18.916 --> 25:21.375
<i>I can still find my way home</i>

25:21.875 --> 25:23.541
<i>and come back to see you.</i>

26:13.666 --> 26:15.708
Wasn't Sung Yuan-yuan suspicious
when you quit your job?

26:18.916 --> 26:20.625
I had my way of informing her.

26:21.708 --> 26:22.916
What way?

26:26.041 --> 26:28.666
I told her that I want to join
a songwriting camp abroad.

26:29.375 --> 26:31.416
The classes will take a year.

26:31.916 --> 26:33.208
Will she believe it?

26:36.166 --> 26:37.875
There's nothing to suspect.

26:39.416 --> 26:41.791
Don't they have such classes
in photography too?

26:44.291 --> 26:45.125
Yes.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.916
This time, I'd like to add one condition.

26:52.291 --> 26:53.416
What is it?

26:54.333 --> 26:55.791
I need your help this time.

27:56.291 --> 27:58.125
<i>I'm going to the restroom.</i>

28:10.041 --> 28:13.250
Since A-Lin's new album
is very multi-faceted,

28:13.333 --> 28:16.625
to have a unified way of identifying her,
don't change her hairstyle too much.

28:16.708 --> 28:19.125
-An-an, why are you here?
-For the attire,

28:19.208 --> 28:22.875
-we'll match them with the song's style.
-I still have so much work to do.

28:22.958 --> 28:24.875
I've compiled some of A-Lin's past styles

28:24.958 --> 28:26.208
for your reference.

28:27.250 --> 28:30.250
Different songs
will require different styles,

28:30.333 --> 28:34.333
but in terms of the color,
I think we can keep it consistent.

28:44.666 --> 28:46.291
Aren't you still on vacation?

28:47.041 --> 28:48.250
Why are you here?

28:49.458 --> 28:51.541
Well, I have nothing to do at home anyway.

28:51.625 --> 28:52.916
I should just come to work.

28:54.458 --> 28:55.500
Right.

28:56.750 --> 28:59.250
This is the copyright contract
for "The Saddest Thing."

28:59.333 --> 29:00.541
Please check it again.

29:05.000 --> 29:05.875
Are you

29:06.416 --> 29:07.375
doing okay?

29:11.375 --> 29:13.416
I just want to get this done properly.

29:15.541 --> 29:16.833
I'll get back to work first.

29:38.833 --> 29:40.166
For the next three years,

29:40.250 --> 29:42.041
can you help me buy this for her?

29:51.125 --> 29:53.125
"Everlasting love.

29:53.916 --> 29:55.125
Strength in loneliness."

29:57.250 --> 29:59.541
So this is the last step
you want to complete?

30:00.875 --> 30:01.750
Yes.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.541
I want to accompany her

30:07.541 --> 30:08.541
in a different way.

30:11.291 --> 30:13.541
Do you think she'll be happy this way?

30:17.958 --> 30:19.000
She'll be happy.

30:22.375 --> 30:23.833
Maybe not now,

30:26.291 --> 30:27.708
but she will as time goes by.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.500
She won't be happy now and in the future.

30:37.833 --> 30:40.833
No amount of time
will make fake happiness real.

30:45.750 --> 30:46.958
You're dying.

30:48.458 --> 30:50.416
Can't you live more straightforwardly?

30:50.500 --> 30:52.583
Just like a person.

30:52.666 --> 30:54.750
Eat when you're hungry.
Cry when you're hurt.

30:54.833 --> 30:56.375
Smile when you're happy.

30:56.458 --> 30:57.958
Throw a fit if you're angry.

30:59.833 --> 31:01.333
Call for help if you're afraid to die.

31:06.625 --> 31:09.416
Won't you regret it if you don't tell her
what you want to say now?

31:09.916 --> 31:11.416
Do you really want

31:12.333 --> 31:13.958
to die just like this?

31:15.375 --> 31:17.416
I really don't want to die just like this.

31:21.333 --> 31:23.208
I want to have a happy life too.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.541
I also hope that I'm the one Cream
is marrying tomorrow, not him.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.416
But that's just a delusion.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.041
It's a…

31:43.666 --> 31:44.708
It's a sad dream.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.333
I don't want to dream again.

31:55.666 --> 31:58.458
<i>I can't understand how he felt</i>

31:59.125 --> 32:01.250
<i>to come to such a decision.</i>

32:02.416 --> 32:04.083
<i>His love for Sung Yuan-yuan</i>

32:04.166 --> 32:06.666
<i>is already beyond imagination.</i>

32:08.833 --> 32:10.250
<i>Is love really that great?</i>

32:10.958 --> 32:12.166
What are you looking at?

32:12.833 --> 32:13.666
This one?

32:14.250 --> 32:16.916
It's a photo of K
that Cindy took before he died.

32:17.583 --> 32:20.333
I really can't imagine loving someone
to the point of losing your life.

32:21.708 --> 32:23.833
K and Cream's story is very sad,

32:23.916 --> 32:25.458
but for the sake of Cream's happiness,

32:25.541 --> 32:26.708
K sacrificed so much.

32:26.791 --> 32:28.416
But Cream still died with K.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.583
Wasn't that a waste of K's effort?

32:31.291 --> 32:33.625
If I were K,
and I knew things would end this way,

32:33.708 --> 32:35.791
I'd be together with Cream from the start.

32:35.875 --> 32:37.958
At least we can date for a while.

32:38.625 --> 32:39.625
I don't think Cream

32:39.708 --> 32:41.041
was considerate of K at all.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.750
Cream's family members are already dead.

32:45.958 --> 32:47.083
To her,

32:47.791 --> 32:50.166
K was her only family.

32:52.375 --> 32:54.708
But once again,
she lost the person she was closest to.

32:55.291 --> 32:57.166
Do you understand that kind of pain?

32:59.958 --> 33:02.250
If you've experienced it before,
would you still say that?

33:02.833 --> 33:03.708
No.

33:03.791 --> 33:05.708
That's not what I meant.

33:11.541 --> 33:12.541
I'm sorry.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.333
<i>K.</i>

33:57.916 --> 33:59.875
Can you help me practice

33:59.958 --> 34:01.333
the wedding ceremony process?

34:08.375 --> 34:09.666
Sung Yuan-yuan.

34:10.916 --> 34:12.625
For richer or for poorer,

34:13.291 --> 34:14.541
in sickness and in health,

34:16.333 --> 34:17.458
are you willing to marry…

34:26.833 --> 34:28.500
…this man in front of you

34:30.166 --> 34:31.625
and become his wife?

34:37.916 --> 34:39.208
I do.

36:05.166 --> 36:06.250
Yang Yu-hsien.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.666
For richer or for poorer,

36:09.250 --> 36:10.500
in sickness and in health,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.291
do you take Sung Yuan-yuan
to be your wife?

36:13.375 --> 36:14.541
I do.

36:15.125 --> 36:16.458
Sung Yuan-yuan.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.291
For richer or for poorer,

36:18.375 --> 36:20.000
in sickness and in health,

36:20.083 --> 36:22.625
are you willing to marry Yang Yu-hsien
and become his wife?

36:23.791 --> 36:25.041
I do.

36:55.916 --> 36:57.625
<i>After letting go of Cream's hand,</i>

36:59.166 --> 37:00.541
<i>in the following days,</i>

37:02.000 --> 37:03.833
<i>you didn't have anything
to care for anymore,</i>

37:04.583 --> 37:05.708
<i>right?</i>

37:15.250 --> 37:16.458
Hey, An Yi-chi.

37:17.166 --> 37:19.125
You haven't eaten yet, right?

37:20.041 --> 37:22.333
I accidentally made too much food today.

37:22.958 --> 37:24.375
Come and eat with me.

37:24.458 --> 37:25.833
<i>It's okay, Po-han.</i>

37:25.916 --> 37:27.125
<i>You don't need to cook for me.</i>

37:27.791 --> 37:29.416
Who's cooking for you?

37:29.500 --> 37:31.500
I told you, it was an accident.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.500
Leave in ten minutes.

37:34.583 --> 37:35.541
I'll call you a ride.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.083
<i>There's really no need.</i>

37:37.166 --> 37:38.291
<i>I don't want to go out.</i>

37:39.791 --> 37:40.916
Leave in ten minutes.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.291
The car will be waiting in front.

37:42.375 --> 37:43.875
Okay. That's all. Bye.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.333
Thank you for taking care of this.

39:11.541 --> 39:12.541
You too.

39:15.166 --> 39:18.250
<i>-Is it painful for those who are left</i>
-Thank you for accompanying Kai-kai.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.750
<i>or is it more painful
for those who have left?</i>

39:22.541 --> 39:24.833
<i>When I saw Chang Che-kai's face,</i>

39:25.541 --> 39:27.416
<i>he looked like he was full of pain,</i>

39:27.916 --> 39:29.750
<i>yet ready to take on</i>

39:29.833 --> 39:32.583
<i>all of Sung Yuan-yuan's sadness.</i>

39:36.000 --> 39:37.250
<i>I can't imagine</i>

39:38.083 --> 39:39.916
<i>how much love it takes</i>

39:40.750 --> 39:43.541
<i>for a person to be willing
to make such a big sacrifice.</i>

40:01.833 --> 40:03.291
Why are you here?

40:04.416 --> 40:07.208
Chang Che-kai was my photography subject.

40:08.083 --> 40:10.083
So I came to pay my respects.

40:16.375 --> 40:17.625
It's such a small world.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.416
It's such a coincidence
that you know him too.

40:23.291 --> 40:25.125
Yes. What a coincidence.

40:27.166 --> 40:28.791
It's so coincidental that it's funny.

42:00.125 --> 42:01.166
Yuan-yuan!

42:03.291 --> 42:04.416
Yuan-yuan!

42:07.541 --> 42:08.583
Yuan-yuan!

42:15.750 --> 42:16.833
Have you seen Yuan-yuan?

42:18.208 --> 42:20.041
I don't know, I just got here.

42:20.541 --> 42:22.333
I haven't been able
to reach her since yesterday.

42:23.416 --> 42:25.916
Her mood hasn't been very stable
ever since Che-kai died.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.750
