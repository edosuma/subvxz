<i> Welcome
to</i> The Kelly File,<i> everyone.</i>

00:36.836 --> 00:38.104
<i>I'm Megyn Kelly.</i>

00:38.138 --> 00:40.673
<i>Breaking tonight, polls are
moving, the race is changing,</i>

00:40.706 --> 00:42.475
<i>and more than a dozen
Republican candidates</i>

00:42.508 --> 00:43.785
<i>are trying
to make themselves heard</i>

00:43.809 --> 00:45.745
<i>with a little more than
one week left</i>

00:45.778 --> 00:48.848
<i>till the debate
that could change everything.</i>

00:48.881 --> 00:50.249
<i>And we're the gateway.</i>

00:50.282 --> 00:51.626
<i>We, the questioners,
are the gateway.</i>

00:51.650 --> 00:52.852
<i>We at Fox and CNN</i>

00:52.885 --> 00:54.419
<i>and everybody else
who gets a chance</i>

00:54.453 --> 00:55.388
<i>to actually moderate</i>

00:55.421 --> 00:56.731
<i>a presidential debate
with these guys.</i>

00:56.755 --> 00:57.690
<i>I mean, these guys,</i>

00:57.723 --> 00:59.759
<i>they deserve to face
tough questioning.</i>

00:59.792 --> 01:01.594
<i>As Chris says, and I agree,</i>

01:01.627 --> 01:03.162
<i>they want
George Washington's job</i>

01:03.195 --> 01:04.330
<i>and they better earn it.</i>

01:04.363 --> 01:05.640
<i>They better show
the American people</i>

01:05.664 --> 01:06.732
<i>they're worthy of it.</i>

01:06.765 --> 01:08.267
<i>A lot of folks assumed</i>

01:08.300 --> 01:10.636
<i>Donald Trump
would flame out by now.</i>

01:10.669 --> 01:13.306
<i>They have been proven wrong.
Now wait.</i>

01:13.339 --> 01:14.416
<i>Here. We gotta get to this</i>

01:14.440 --> 01:17.143
<i>because this is just breaking
on</i> The Daily Beast.

01:17.176 --> 01:18.277
<i>The headline is,</i>

01:18.311 --> 01:22.615
<i>"Ex-wife: Donald Trump made me
feel violated during sex.</i>

01:22.648 --> 01:24.116
<i>Ivana Trump once accused</i>

01:24.150 --> 01:26.619
<i>the real-estate tycoon
of quote, 'rape.'"</i>

01:26.652 --> 01:28.287
<i>Somebody who speaks
for Donald Trump</i>

01:28.320 --> 01:30.256
<i>has come out
and denied it as well</i>

01:30.289 --> 01:32.425
<i>and added that legally, he says,</i>

01:32.458 --> 01:35.461
<i>"you cannot rape your spouse."</i>

01:35.494 --> 01:38.197
<i>Here's the one thing
you probably know about me.</i>

01:38.230 --> 01:39.832
<i>I have a big mouth.</i>

01:39.865 --> 01:41.865
<i> Roger,
you have Megyn on line one.</i>

01:43.769 --> 01:45.638
- Megyn.
<i>- Morning, Roger.</i>

01:45.671 --> 01:47.740
What'd you do to piss off Trump?

01:47.773 --> 01:49.475
We did a segment
on recent coverage

01:49.508 --> 01:51.176
of his ex-wife's rape claim.

01:51.210 --> 01:52.410
You're giving that oxygen

01:52.444 --> 01:53.813
before the first goddamn debate?

01:53.846 --> 01:57.517
Roger, we had a full-screen
of Ivana's recantation.

01:57.550 --> 01:58.551
Which is soft.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.520
<i> She accused him
during a divorce.</i>

02:00.553 --> 02:03.189
Well, his lawyer, Michael Cohen,

02:03.222 --> 02:04.556
claims you can't rape a spouse.

02:04.590 --> 02:05.825
It pissed me off.

02:05.858 --> 02:08.661
<i>Great. The future of Fox News
is now a goddamn feminist.</i>

02:08.693 --> 02:10.162
No. I'm not a feminist.

02:10.196 --> 02:11.664
- I'm a lawyer.
- <i>We need him.</i>

02:11.697 --> 02:13.500
Clean this up. Now.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.746
<i> Unfortunately,
when it comes to</i>

02:17.770 --> 02:19.438
<i>politicians and the media,</i>

02:19.471 --> 02:21.407
<i>Roger Ailes knows his shit.</i>

02:21.440 --> 02:23.341
<i>Appointed head of
the Fox News channel</i>

02:23.375 --> 02:24.911
<i>by media mogul Rupert Murdoch,</i>

02:24.944 --> 02:29.182
<i>Roger transformed cable news,
pushing Fox to the forefront.</i>

02:29.215 --> 02:31.217
<i>Years before,
to get Nixon elected,</i>

02:31.250 --> 02:33.719
<i>he created the modern
town-hall debate.</i>

02:33.752 --> 02:35.254
<i>To get Reagan elected,</i>

02:35.287 --> 02:36.831
<i>he made him address
the elephant in the room.</i>

02:36.855 --> 02:40.560
I will not make age
an issue of this campaign.

02:40.593 --> 02:42.460
I am not going to exploit

02:42.494 --> 02:44.697
my opponent's youth
and inexperience.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.867
<i> To get
George H.W. Bush elected,</i>

02:47.900 --> 02:49.535
<i>somebody did
the Willie Horton ads.</i>

02:49.568 --> 02:52.772
<i>Roger denies it was him...
a lot.</i>

02:52.805 --> 02:55.508
<i>I have been astounded
at the number of Americans</i>

02:55.541 --> 02:57.543
<i>who are fine with our country</i>

02:57.576 --> 02:59.345
<i>moving in a socialist direction.</i>

02:59.378 --> 03:00.313
Here we go.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.516
<i>Their views on capitalism
are quite alarming.</i>

03:03.549 --> 03:04.684
<i>I'm a...</i>

03:04.685 --> 03:05.818
News is like a ship.

03:05.851 --> 03:07.386
You take your hands
off the wheel

03:07.419 --> 03:09.522
and it pulls hard to the left.

03:10.823 --> 03:13.793
Hey, look at this.
James Murdoch.

03:13.826 --> 03:16.295
Tell me those lips
haven't sucked cock.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.204
This is what nepotism gets you.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.440
Roger rules Fox
from behind these doors,

03:27.473 --> 03:28.908
on the second floor.

03:28.941 --> 03:31.544
When employees say,
"the second floor,"

03:31.577 --> 03:32.945
they mean Roger,

03:32.978 --> 03:35.648
or the many VPs
paid to enact his will

03:35.681 --> 03:37.917
without qualms or questions.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.786
Now, I know what some of you
are thinking, and no,

03:40.819 --> 03:42.822
Roger does not tell us
what to say on air.

03:42.855 --> 03:43.923
He doesn't have to.

03:43.956 --> 03:45.725
- Love that dress, Megyn.
- Thank you.

03:45.758 --> 03:46.993
No, really. I love it.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.697
He's not horny.
He's just ambitious.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.632
<i>Roger is always watching.</i>

03:53.666 --> 03:55.901
<i>The Eagles
postponed their appearance</i>

03:55.934 --> 03:57.903
<i>because co-founder, Glenn Frey,</i>

03:57.936 --> 03:58.871
<i>is too ill to travel.</i>

03:58.904 --> 04:00.673
<i>In a statement,
the band announced...</i>

04:00.706 --> 04:01.807
Morons.

04:01.841 --> 04:04.043
<i> The phone in his office
connects directly</i>

04:04.076 --> 04:05.420
<i>to the control room...</i>

04:05.444 --> 04:07.613
Which is down
on the first floor.

04:10.549 --> 04:12.351
- Yes, sir?
<i>- You fucking idiots!</i>

04:12.384 --> 04:14.320
That's not Glenn Frey,
it's Don Henley!

04:14.353 --> 04:15.630
- Dump the B-roll.
- Dump it, dump it.

04:15.654 --> 04:16.689
Back to anchor.

04:16.721 --> 04:18.757
That's not Glenn Frey,
that's Don fucking Henley!

04:18.791 --> 04:19.841
Oh, shoot.

04:19.843 --> 04:20.892
What the fuck, Kayla?

04:20.926 --> 04:23.296
I'm sorry.
I don't know secular music.

04:23.329 --> 04:24.463
The <i> Eagles?</i>

04:24.496 --> 04:25.774
Only the biggest band
of the '70s.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.366
When my mom was a toddler.

04:27.399 --> 04:28.701
They all look the same.

04:28.734 --> 04:30.603
- They're just old.
- Oh, my God.

04:30.636 --> 04:34.307
Down in the basement
is the Fox newsroom.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.876
All our shows have crews
who work in these pods.

04:38.010 --> 04:39.012
This is my staff.

04:39.845 --> 04:41.514
Hey, guys.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.983
We're below the city,
so it smells like mold.

04:44.016 --> 04:45.685
But there hasn't been
a rat sighting

04:45.718 --> 04:47.486
in four months.

04:47.519 --> 04:48.954
Four months.

04:48.987 --> 04:51.857
The anchors and their
key producers have base camps.

04:51.890 --> 04:54.327
Here, on 17 and 18.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.928
Often decorated with viewer art.

04:58.497 --> 05:00.499
And everyone in this building,

05:00.532 --> 05:03.369
even Roger, answers to eight.

05:03.402 --> 05:04.870
The eighth floor is home

05:04.903 --> 05:07.640
to CEO Rupert Murdoch
and his sons.

05:07.673 --> 05:10.976
This is the power
behind the power.

05:11.009 --> 05:13.612
The actual studios are
scattered around the building.

05:13.645 --> 05:16.748
Most anchor
and show offices are here.

05:16.782 --> 05:18.918
Above are Fox Business, radio,

05:18.951 --> 05:21.387
<i>New York Post</i>
and <i> The Wall Street Journal.</i>

05:21.420 --> 05:23.889
Most of the American
conservative establishment.

05:23.922 --> 05:26.058
In one building.

05:26.091 --> 05:27.793
<i>The stage is finally set</i>

05:27.826 --> 05:29.929
<i>for tonight's Republican
debate in Cleveland.</i>

05:29.962 --> 05:31.039
<i>All the candidates are looking</i>

05:31.063 --> 05:31.931
<i>for a boost tonight,</i>

05:31.964 --> 05:34.133
<i>but only ten of them
have a chance</i>

05:34.166 --> 05:36.435
<i>to appeal to voters
in prime time.</i>

05:46.879 --> 05:49.081
Trump has a real problem
with women.

05:49.114 --> 05:50.383
I wanna ask about it.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.385
You can back that up?

05:54.420 --> 05:55.421
Yes.

05:57.589 --> 05:58.724
Good morning.

05:58.757 --> 05:59.959
Morning, Chris.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.405
Excuse me.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.089
Do you think that's it?

06:32.509 --> 06:33.826
Sorry.

06:38.697 --> 06:39.899
It's probably nerves.

06:39.932 --> 06:43.736
No. When I'm nervous,
I hear my heart.

06:43.769 --> 06:45.704
I can't hear it.

06:45.737 --> 06:49.775
That's your first question?
Is this some feminist thing?

06:49.808 --> 06:51.177
She's not a feminist.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.678
It goes to his electability.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.648
Did you run it past Tom Lowell?

06:55.681 --> 06:57.515
We can go after Trump.

06:57.549 --> 06:58.789
The second floor
said that?

06:58.817 --> 07:00.686
No.

07:00.719 --> 07:02.622
The eighth. The Murdochs.

07:04.122 --> 07:07.126
Rupert called Roger and said,
about Trump, enough is enough.

07:07.159 --> 07:10.162
Look, all Trump does
is watch Fox.

07:10.195 --> 07:12.965
Roger gave him air
for his crazy theories

07:12.998 --> 07:14.467
and idiot grievances.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.970
Why? 'Cause Roger shares
a lot of them.

07:18.003 --> 07:19.839
Are you sure
you wanna take that on?

07:19.872 --> 07:21.507
Yes.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.542
<i> It's the new
look of politics...</i>

07:23.575 --> 07:24.986
Okay, I don't know
if these are strong enough,

07:25.010 --> 07:26.545
- but they help me.
- Uh-huh. Nausea?

07:26.578 --> 07:29.114
Yeah.
You go live in five hours.

07:31.116 --> 07:32.217
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.253
Okay.

07:34.286 --> 07:36.489
<i> Donald Trump
feeds his own narrative.</i>

07:36.522 --> 07:37.857
Oh, fuck.
So nauseous.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.133
If you can try
to keep them down.

07:39.157 --> 07:40.125
Yeah.

07:40.158 --> 07:42.561
Fuck.
Stop making that face, Julia.

07:42.594 --> 07:43.996
I'm not making a face.

07:44.029 --> 07:45.698
Five hours?

07:45.731 --> 07:46.966
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:51.169 --> 07:53.705
Don't worry.
We're behind you.

07:53.739 --> 07:54.840
Way behind you.

07:58.210 --> 07:59.777
There's a blanket on the chair

07:59.811 --> 08:01.680
and, just in case,
a trash can beside it.

08:01.713 --> 08:04.884
<i> Welcome to the first
Republican primary debate.</i>

08:04.917 --> 08:08.686
<i>Tonight's moderators
will be Bret Baier,</i>

08:08.720 --> 08:11.023
<i>Chris Wallace and Megyn Kelly.</i>

08:19.331 --> 08:22.735
<i>Mr. Trump, one of the things
people love about you</i>

08:22.768 --> 08:23.736
<i>is you speak your mind</i>

08:23.769 --> 08:25.938
<i>and you don't use
a politician's filter.</i>

08:25.971 --> 08:28.707
<i>However, that is not
without its downsides.</i>

08:28.740 --> 08:30.218
<i>In particular,
when it comes to women.</i>

08:30.242 --> 08:35.080
<i>You've called women you don't
like, "fat pigs," "dogs,"</i>

08:35.113 --> 08:37.250
<i>"slobs"
and "disgusting animals."</i>

08:37.717 --> 08:39.183
What is she doing?

08:39.217 --> 08:40.552
<i>Your Twitter account...</i>

08:40.553 --> 08:41.885
<i>Only Rosie O'Donnell.</i>

08:41.919 --> 08:43.164
Great TV.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.157
She knows what she's doing.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.726
<i>Your Twitter account...</i>

08:50.329 --> 08:53.598
<i>For the record, it was
well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.</i>

08:53.632 --> 08:54.800
<i> Yes, I'm sure it was.</i>

08:54.833 --> 08:57.002
<i>Your Twitter account has
several disparaging comments</i>

08:57.035 --> 08:58.670
<i>about women's looks.</i>

08:58.704 --> 09:00.682
<i>You once told a contestant
on</i> Celebrity Apprentice

09:00.706 --> 09:03.676
<i>it would be a pretty picture
to see her on her knees.</i>

09:03.709 --> 09:05.810
<i>Does that sound to you
like the temperament</i>

09:05.844 --> 09:07.846
<i>of a man we should elect
as President?</i>

09:07.879 --> 09:09.123
<i>And how will you
answer the charge</i>

09:09.147 --> 09:10.725
- <i>from Hillary Clinton...</i>
- She's calling him out.

09:10.749 --> 09:13.185
<i>Who is likely
to be the Democratic nominee,</i>

09:13.218 --> 09:16.288
<i>that you are part of the war

09:16.321 --> 09:20.125
<i>Call me stupid, but I thought
he'd respect the challenge.</i>

09:20.158 --> 09:23.295
Trump is pissed.
He was up all night, tweeting.

09:23.328 --> 09:25.264
Crap. Really?

09:25.297 --> 09:26.374
What was he tweeting?

09:26.398 --> 09:29.268
"Fox viewers give low marks
to bimbo @MegynKelly."

09:29.301 --> 09:30.236
Ugh. I hate that word.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.171
Yeah. It says you're too sexy
to be smart,

09:32.204 --> 09:33.872
but not smart enough to be sexy.

09:33.905 --> 09:36.709
2:40 a.m. "Wow, @MegynKelly
really bombed tonight.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.911
"People are going wild
on Twitter! Funny to watch."

09:38.944 --> 09:40.613
3:07 a.m. "Dear @Megyn..."

09:40.614 --> 09:42.281
Go, Trump. Donald Trump.

09:42.314 --> 09:43.348
Okay.

09:43.382 --> 09:44.916
How many times did he tweet?

09:44.950 --> 09:46.652
Like, 15.

09:46.685 --> 09:48.087
Yeah.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.722
He's never gonna be President.

09:51.089 --> 09:53.792
Wait. Am I gonna be the story?

09:53.825 --> 09:54.827
No.

09:56.061 --> 09:57.338
- I'm gonna be the story.
- No.

09:57.362 --> 09:58.997
No. No.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.333
<i>I can't let you go without
talking about Donald Trump.</i>

10:01.366 --> 10:03.168
Gretchen's giving
this two blocks?

10:03.201 --> 10:04.703
It's that
far down the food chain?

10:04.736 --> 10:06.047
We should get you
a security team.

10:06.071 --> 10:07.139
Think it over.

10:07.172 --> 10:09.208
Trump called me
before the debate.

10:10.342 --> 10:13.279
He said he knew that your
first question was harsh.

10:14.413 --> 10:15.715
How could he know that?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.016
No idea.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.217
I sure didn't.

10:22.854 --> 10:26.158
It was good TV.
Unexpected. Goddamn tough.

10:26.191 --> 10:27.727
Proud of you, Megyn.

10:28.994 --> 10:30.363
Thanks, Roger.

10:31.396 --> 10:32.397
Heard you were sick.

10:33.031 --> 10:34.032
Yeah.

10:35.133 --> 10:36.869
I think it was my coffee.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.837
- Where'd you get it?
- My driver.

10:38.870 --> 10:40.939
He insisted
on some fancy coffee joint.

10:40.972 --> 10:42.141
You know this guy?

10:42.974 --> 10:44.743
No. He's a driver, Roger.

10:44.776 --> 10:46.344
- Did you know him?
- No.

10:46.378 --> 10:47.880
You know better than that.

10:48.847 --> 10:51.983
<i> Okay, yes,
Roger Ailes is paranoid.</i>

10:52.017 --> 10:54.019
<i>But his parents were nuts.</i>

10:54.052 --> 10:55.020
<i>As he drove off to college,</i>

10:55.053 --> 10:57.890
<i>they filed for divorce,
and didn't tell him.</i>

10:57.923 --> 11:00.426
<i>At Christmas, he came home
to find strangers in his house</i>

11:00.459 --> 11:01.426
<i>and all his things,</i>

11:01.460 --> 11:04.430
<i>photos and yearbooks
and trophies thrown out.</i>

11:04.463 --> 11:06.699
<i>I mean, is it any wonder
the man created</i>

11:06.732 --> 11:08.367
<i>a nostalgia machine
for lost America?</i>

11:09.401 --> 11:10.770
This is crazy.

11:12.404 --> 11:13.806
We're sitting here wondering

11:13.839 --> 11:16.108
if a candidate for President
poisoned my coffee.

11:16.141 --> 11:17.876
It's only crazy
until it happens.

11:17.909 --> 11:19.412
And it happens.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.847
I hate being the story.

11:21.880 --> 11:22.981
I'll call Trump.

11:23.014 --> 11:25.217
You go on vacation.
Stay above it all.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.020
He won't dent your ratings.

11:28.053 --> 11:31.857
Nobody stops watching
because of a conflict.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.759
They stop watching
when there isn't one.

11:33.792 --> 11:35.194
Some viewers will listen to him.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.329
Well, some. But as long
as he keeps saying,

11:37.362 --> 11:39.231
"Megyn Kelly is unwatchable,"

11:39.264 --> 11:42.167
that means he's watching it.
They know that.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.070
And they'll watch
what he watches.

11:44.903 --> 11:45.905
You'll be okay.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.274
See you in a week.

11:49.307 --> 11:50.384
Drink up, buddy boy.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.045
Thank you.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.747
Here's to a week
of no kids, but my own.

11:55.781 --> 11:56.614
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.851
Okay, Frank Bruni in <i> The Times.</i>

11:58.884 --> 12:00.385
- Boo.
- "The debate was riveting.

12:00.418 --> 12:01.286
"It was admirable.

12:01.319 --> 12:02.988
"It compels me
to write a cluster of words

12:03.021 --> 12:04.289
"I never imagined writing:

12:04.322 --> 12:05.991
- "hooray for Fox News."
- Wow.

12:06.024 --> 12:07.101
Well, that's gotta
make you happy,

12:07.125 --> 12:08.994
praise all tangled up
in an insult.

12:09.027 --> 12:10.329
It does make me happy, Gil.

12:10.362 --> 12:12.106
<i> And, you know,
you could see there was</i>

12:12.130 --> 12:13.332
<i>blood coming out of her eyes,</i>

12:13.365 --> 12:15.134
<i>blood coming out of her...</i>

12:15.167 --> 12:16.135
- <i>wherever.</i>
- No. Oh, my God.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.504
Did he just accuse me
of anger-menstruating?

12:19.873 --> 12:21.206
Yes. Are... Um, yeah.

12:21.239 --> 12:22.483
- Yeah.
- I'm calling Roger.

12:22.507 --> 12:23.851
No. I'll talk to him.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.186
Take your vacation.
I'll handle this.

12:25.210 --> 12:26.320
- Oh, my God.
- Do you hear the phones?

12:26.344 --> 12:27.379
Doug.

12:27.412 --> 12:28.280
I have to call you back.

12:28.313 --> 12:29.524
<i>Would you like to
correct yourself</i>

12:29.548 --> 12:32.818
<i>on that other talking point
about men being dominant?</i>

12:32.851 --> 12:35.220
<i>We don't have any time.
I wish we did.</i>

12:35.253 --> 12:36.430
<i>We're running over,
we're running over.</i>

12:36.454 --> 12:38.991
<i>Yeah, well, HR is on the phone
'cause you called me a skirt.</i>

12:39.024 --> 12:40.402
<i> I gotta read
that manual again.</i>

12:40.426 --> 12:42.895
<i>I'll bring it to your office
right after the show.</i>

12:42.928 --> 12:43.896
<i> Some guy came up
to me and said,</i>

12:43.929 --> 12:45.040
<i>"I saw you on</i> Fox & Friends
this morning.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.800
<i>"Is Gretchen as cute in person
as she is on TV?"</i>

12:47.833 --> 12:49.410
<i>- Oh, come on.
- And what did you answer him?</i>

12:49.434 --> 12:50.468
<i>Beautiful dress.</i>

12:50.502 --> 12:52.036
<i>You look wonderful.
Great color.</i>

12:52.070 --> 12:53.405
<i>In summary,
Gretchen's beautiful.</i>

12:53.438 --> 12:54.840
<i>Beautiful. You look beautiful.</i>

12:54.873 --> 12:56.809
<i>Well, you look fabulous, too.</i>

12:56.842 --> 12:58.944
<i> 'Cause you gotta wax?
Does the waxing hurt?</i>

12:58.977 --> 13:00.813
<i>Uh, he looks at me for that!</i>

13:00.846 --> 13:02.356
<i> We'll try that.
Women are everywhere.</i>

13:02.380 --> 13:04.091
<i>We're letting 'em play golf
and tennis now.</i>

13:04.115 --> 13:05.226
<i>- It's outta control.
- You know what?</i>

13:05.250 --> 13:06.360
<i>You know...</i>
<i> She's out.</i>

13:06.384 --> 13:10.189
<i>You read the headlines,
since men are so great.</i>

13:10.222 --> 13:11.240
<i>She needed a shower.</i>

13:12.290 --> 13:14.992
The attitude off-camera
was even worse.

13:15.026 --> 13:16.929
Steve simply started
ignoring me.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.464
What did Mr. Ailes say
when you complained?

13:19.497 --> 13:22.067
He said, "You act
like it only rains on women.

13:22.100 --> 13:26.138
"Stop getting goddamn offended
by everything.

13:26.171 --> 13:27.406
"You're a man-hater."

13:27.439 --> 13:30.543
And, um, "Learn to get along
with the boys."

13:31.543 --> 13:32.911
Then he took me off the show.

13:32.944 --> 13:34.279
But gave you your own.

13:34.312 --> 13:36.481
Well, in the afternoon
dead zone.

13:36.514 --> 13:38.350
I mean, it was a demotion
and we both knew it.

13:38.383 --> 13:42.421
Even though I did increase
the ratings by 15%.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.824
He moved me
to second base.

13:45.891 --> 13:46.992
<i>Back in Minnesota,</i>

13:47.026 --> 13:49.862
<i>before I graduated
summa cum laude from Stanford,</i>

13:49.895 --> 13:51.997
<i>before I was crowned
Miss America,</i>

13:52.030 --> 13:53.398
<i>I played second base</i>

13:53.431 --> 13:55.467
<i>in the sixth-grade
softball league.</i>

13:57.369 --> 13:59.638
I hate second base.

13:59.671 --> 14:01.607
Did he ever offer
to reverse that decision

14:01.640 --> 14:04.877
if you made yourself
sexually available?

14:04.910 --> 14:06.478
Not directly.

14:06.511 --> 14:09.348
With Roger,
it's always about loyalty.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.884
He says he can fix things
if you're loyal.

14:11.917 --> 14:14.286
And you can guess the ultimate
expression of loyalty.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.422
We don't guess.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.358
Oral sex.

14:19.825 --> 14:20.792
Roger likes to joke,

14:20.826 --> 14:23.395
"To get ahead,
you gotta give a little head."

14:23.428 --> 14:24.430
Really.

14:25.297 --> 14:26.498
But Mr. Ailes

14:26.531 --> 14:29.501
never unambiguously
asks for oral sex?

14:29.534 --> 14:32.404
I mean, it was always
just a joke, a put-down.

14:32.437 --> 14:34.573
Like, "You're sexy
but you're too much work."

14:34.606 --> 14:35.908
You're... I mean...

14:35.941 --> 14:39.111
I have a whole list in here

14:39.144 --> 14:41.380
because that's just
how Roger is.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.690
What do you want
out of a lawsuit?

14:42.714 --> 14:46.652
What do I want?
I want this behavior to stop.

14:46.685 --> 14:49.454
Someone has to speak up.
Someone has to get mad.

14:49.487 --> 14:51.555
Well, that may not be you.

14:51.589 --> 14:53.492
Your contract will have a clause

14:53.525 --> 14:55.928
requiring secret,
mandatory arbitration.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.405
You familiar
with Rudi Bakhtiar's case?

14:57.429 --> 14:59.269
<i>- Yes.
- Well, you're supposed to be.</i>

15:00.532 --> 15:02.568
My first act as
DC bureau chief...

15:03.702 --> 15:05.404
I want you down here full-time.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.940
Oh, my God.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.507
That's amazing. Yes.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.143
You do know
what this means for you?

15:11.176 --> 15:13.378
<i> Shit.
He doesn't think I'm ready.</i>

15:13.411 --> 15:15.680
Brian, I will not let you down.

15:15.714 --> 15:17.249
I'm gonna bust my ass for you.

15:17.282 --> 15:19.384
Well, Rudi, come on,
that's a given.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.186
<i> So, what's the problem?</i>

15:21.219 --> 15:23.422
But, um...

15:23.455 --> 15:27.559
Look, you do get
how I feel about you, right?

15:27.592 --> 15:30.496
<i> Oh, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

15:31.696 --> 15:34.099
Well, I'm glad
you said that, Brian,

15:34.132 --> 15:35.633
because I really respect
you, too.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.937
No. No. I mean...

15:40.372 --> 15:42.540
How I really feel.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.175
<i> Just look confused.</i>

15:45.276 --> 15:47.112
All I want from you, Rudi,

15:47.145 --> 15:49.548
is to see the inside
of your hotel room.

15:49.581 --> 15:52.117
<i> God damn it.</i>

15:52.150 --> 15:53.584
That's all it's gonna take.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.588
<i>Don't react.
Make it your fault.</i>

15:57.522 --> 15:59.358
Brian, if I've done anything

15:59.391 --> 16:01.259
to make you think
I feel that way about you,

16:01.292 --> 16:03.128
I apologize.

16:03.161 --> 16:04.195
<i>Friends.</i>

16:04.229 --> 16:05.464
We're friends.

16:05.497 --> 16:06.732
<i>Professionals.</i>

16:06.765 --> 16:08.334
We have
a great professional vibe.

16:09.601 --> 16:10.635
<i>Now sell it.</i>

16:10.668 --> 16:11.502
I just don't do that.

16:11.536 --> 16:13.372
I've never had to do that
for a job.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.506
I know, I know.

16:14.539 --> 16:17.242
You know I'd kill for DC,

16:17.275 --> 16:20.345
but there's no way
I'm showing you my hotel room.

16:20.378 --> 16:22.348
<i>This is gonna ruin my career.</i>

16:25.650 --> 16:27.651
Well, now I feel like a creep.

16:27.685 --> 16:30.756
No.
No, you're so not.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.358
<i>Fucking creep.</i>

16:37.262 --> 16:39.363
They fired me.

16:39.397 --> 16:42.067
I'm a lousy reporter
apparently. Assholes.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.348
<i> She proved
what they wanted her to prove.</i>

16:47.372 --> 16:50.242
No one really wins
by suing Fox News.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.310
It's been our experience

16:52.343 --> 16:54.646
that once you go public
in your job,

16:56.347 --> 16:58.417
no one will hire you.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.485
If you're able
to stick it out at Fox,

17:00.518 --> 17:01.586
gather more evidence,

17:01.619 --> 17:06.558
you might be able to sue
Ailes himself instead of Fox.

17:06.589 --> 17:07.724
And that is why I'm here.

17:07.759 --> 17:11.762
Because Marty Hyman told me
that over here in New Jersey,

17:11.796 --> 17:15.367
I can avoid arbitration
by suing Roger personally.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.569
He says that you've managed
to change the law,

17:17.602 --> 17:19.237
and that we could
call other women

17:19.270 --> 17:20.704
and show a pattern.

17:20.738 --> 17:22.574
Will other women come forward?

17:22.607 --> 17:23.840
Yes, they will.

17:23.875 --> 17:26.242
You live and work in New York.

17:26.277 --> 17:28.213
Roger has a house
in Bergen County

17:28.246 --> 17:30.082
where he stays
when he can't make it upstate.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.551
You do
your homework, Ms. Carlson.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.220
No fingerprints.

17:35.253 --> 17:37.489
That's how much I practiced
the violin as a child.

17:37.522 --> 17:39.357
If Roger finds out
you came to us,

17:39.390 --> 17:40.425
he won't just fire you.

17:40.426 --> 17:41.460
Mmm.

17:41.493 --> 17:44.696
He will bang us
with a million-dollar lawsuit.

17:44.729 --> 17:47.299
He will attack you personally.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.243
These men, they care
more about their reputations

17:49.267 --> 17:50.402
than they do money.

17:50.435 --> 17:51.636
Roger won't stop.

17:51.669 --> 17:53.247
- Oh, I know. Mmm-hmm.
- You know that.

17:53.271 --> 17:55.841
Colleagues you admire
will say publicly

17:55.874 --> 17:57.876
you're a superior,
ambitious woman

17:57.909 --> 18:00.279
who's suing
because her career stalled.

18:00.812 --> 18:02.347
Let 'em.

18:05.817 --> 18:06.885
Okay.

18:06.918 --> 18:10.187
If we work hard,
you might be lucky enough

18:10.221 --> 18:11.823
to watch
the most powerful man in TV

18:11.856 --> 18:13.658
go after you
with everything he's got.

18:16.327 --> 18:18.196
Thank you.

18:18.229 --> 18:22.634
I'm telling you,
other women will come forward.

18:24.202 --> 18:25.537
Let's hope.

18:25.570 --> 18:27.405
Frankly,
I think you have a gap

18:27.438 --> 18:29.474
in the network, Mr. Shine.

18:29.507 --> 18:32.811
There are millions of young
conservatives in this country.

18:32.844 --> 18:35.714
I mean, you can look at my
Instagram account. There are.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.816
They don't have a voice
on our network.

18:38.850 --> 18:41.887
I see myself as an influencer
in the Jesus space.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.321
And don't get me wrong,

18:43.354 --> 18:45.457
I've learned a ton
from Gretchen,

18:45.490 --> 18:46.591
I truly have, of course.

18:46.624 --> 18:49.261
But no judgment here,

18:49.294 --> 18:52.164
my perspective
as an evangelical millennial?

18:52.197 --> 18:55.266
It's just not that helpful
to her.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.270
I mean, to be honest,
Mr. Shine,

18:58.303 --> 19:00.639
she's sort of Establishment.

19:00.672 --> 19:02.374
With a capital E.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.909
That's why I wanted
to talk to you in private.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.846
Kayla, before we move you up,

19:08.713 --> 19:11.783
I want to ask you
something personal.

19:11.816 --> 19:12.851
Mmm.

19:13.885 --> 19:16.221
What do you think of our slogan,

19:16.254 --> 19:17.523
"Fair and Balanced"?

19:18.023 --> 19:19.524
I'm glad you asked.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.394
Look, our news shows

19:22.427 --> 19:24.428
and our opinion shows
are very different.

19:24.462 --> 19:27.732
Our news is impartial,
it's top-of-the-line.

19:27.765 --> 19:29.367
Our opinion shows,

19:29.400 --> 19:32.437
Roger gave a voice
to people who didn't have one.

19:32.470 --> 19:35.941
And he balanced
the American conversation.

19:35.974 --> 19:39.811
So, our newspeople are fair.

19:39.844 --> 19:44.449
Our entertainers are a very
necessary form of balance.

19:47.518 --> 19:49.888
Attagirl. Perfect.

19:51.789 --> 19:53.400
But today,
we're sticking up for girls

19:53.424 --> 19:55.694
on International Day
of the Girl.

19:55.727 --> 19:58.597
And, for the first time
on cable news, here I am,

19:58.630 --> 20:00.932
makeup-free for a reason.

20:00.965 --> 20:04.636
<i>Tomorrow I'll be back
in my regular makeup.</i>

20:04.669 --> 20:05.946
And I thank
the other brave women

20:05.970 --> 20:07.939
who came on today's show <i>
sans</i> makeup.

20:07.972 --> 20:12.811
But let's continue to tell
our girls, "Just be yourself."

20:12.844 --> 20:13.945
Shep.

20:13.978 --> 20:14.989
- And clear.
- Yes.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.414
Great show.

20:16.447 --> 20:17.891
Get me some makeup.

20:17.915 --> 20:19.651
I have some bad news.

20:19.684 --> 20:22.787
Kayla is leaving us
for the asshole.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.265
- O'Reilly?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.992
It is our highest-rated program.

20:27.025 --> 20:28.627
And we can't be?

20:28.660 --> 20:30.695
No, I believe
in <i> Real Story,</i> I do.

20:30.728 --> 20:33.331
Did you just see that segment?
Did you see it? Did you see...

20:33.364 --> 20:35.333
We're doing
something unique here.

20:35.366 --> 20:37.269
Mmm-hmm.
- Together. All of us.

20:37.302 --> 20:38.370
Can you just...

20:38.371 --> 20:39.437
Sure.

20:39.470 --> 20:40.505
Listen to me.

20:41.873 --> 20:44.409
I can get you
where you wanna be.

20:44.442 --> 20:45.777
I can protect you.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.021
Just don't get ahead
of yourself.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.347
You have a lot to learn.
I can teach you.

20:49.380 --> 20:50.758
I'm not getting ahead
of myself, Gretchen.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.326
- I'm taking the next step.
- No. Listen.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.935
I learn by doing.

20:53.936 --> 20:55.520
Come on.
Come on, please.

20:55.553 --> 20:56.655
I'm confused.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.490
You want me to pass on
a promotion

20:58.523 --> 21:02.293
so you can help me
get the same promotion

21:02.327 --> 21:03.837
- on a show with worse ratings?
- No. I just...

21:03.861 --> 21:05.997
I want a little loyalty.
I need loyalty.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.399
Women, together.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.717
I'm loyal to the network.

21:08.718 --> 21:10.001
All right.

21:10.034 --> 21:11.603
It's not us versus them,
Gretchen.

21:11.636 --> 21:12.738
Miss America.

21:13.638 --> 21:14.773
Roger.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.408
Hi, there.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.510
- This is a treat.
- What the fuck are you doing?

21:18.543 --> 21:21.412
A segment on how
we oversexualize women.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.581
I mean, you said
be more myself, so, ta-da.

21:24.615 --> 21:26.017
You know
what makeup does?

21:26.050 --> 21:27.819
Keeps everybody
from seeing you sweat.

21:27.852 --> 21:30.488
Well, it's... Most of
the mean tweets that I receive

21:30.521 --> 21:31.923
are about my appearance,

21:31.956 --> 21:33.558
so it is important
that we fight back

21:33.591 --> 21:34.635
against this kind of bullying.

21:34.659 --> 21:36.061
Bullying isn't meanness.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.729
Bullying is
people with more power

21:37.762 --> 21:39.364
hitting people with less.

21:39.397 --> 21:41.099
These jackasses have cellphones.

21:41.132 --> 21:42.868
You have a fucking TV show!

21:45.636 --> 21:47.114
We have to fight
the objectification of women.

21:47.138 --> 21:48.406
Oh, bullshit.

21:48.439 --> 21:51.042
Listen, mouth shut, ears open.

21:51.075 --> 21:53.011
Nobody wants to watch
a middle-aged woman

21:53.044 --> 21:54.612
sweat her way through menopause.

21:54.645 --> 21:55.546
What?

21:55.580 --> 21:57.816
Not on
national fucking television!

21:57.849 --> 22:00.351
Thank you for the advice.

22:00.385 --> 22:02.387
Objectification.

22:07.892 --> 22:08.960
All right.

22:08.993 --> 22:10.395
Gretchen, I really appreciate...

22:10.428 --> 22:11.430
Shut up.

22:13.765 --> 22:14.766
Good luck.

22:22.874 --> 22:24.042
Drift.

22:25.476 --> 22:26.478
Go, go, go!

22:27.745 --> 22:28.979
Whoo! Good one, honey.

22:29.013 --> 22:30.482
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

22:36.954 --> 22:37.989
Hey.

22:38.022 --> 22:39.524
It's a zoo here.

22:39.557 --> 22:40.837
The phone's ringing
off the hook.

22:41.926 --> 22:43.561
Anyone care
he called me a bimbo?

22:43.594 --> 22:44.662
Not really.

22:44.695 --> 22:45.797
He tweeted the <i> GQ</i> photo.

22:45.798 --> 22:46.898
<i> I saw.</i>

22:46.931 --> 22:48.767
<i>- And?</i>
- Torn.

22:48.800 --> 22:52.437
God, I'd love to be slut-shamed.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.873
Gil wants to ask again
if we should make a statement.

22:54.906 --> 22:57.142
No. No response. Zero.

22:58.743 --> 23:00.579
Doug just lost.
I gotta go.

23:02.647 --> 23:03.715
Next time, honey.

23:03.748 --> 23:04.883
Nice.

23:04.916 --> 23:05.967
Good game.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.018
Trump, '16.

23:08.719 --> 23:09.888
Excuse me.

23:09.921 --> 23:11.423
You talk to my wife again,

23:11.456 --> 23:12.991
I will beat you
to a fucking pulp.

23:15.626 --> 23:16.995
- That was weird.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:19.063 --> 23:20.765
You're getting some action.

23:20.798 --> 23:21.900
Oh, really?

23:33.062 --> 23:34.546
Oh, man.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.148
Asshole.

23:37.248 --> 23:38.716
You don't have to worry
about Trump.

23:38.749 --> 23:40.585
You're tougher
than all those guys, okay?

23:40.618 --> 23:41.795
You just gotta worry
about the crazies.

23:41.819 --> 23:43.197
- I can handle a few crazies.
- I know.

23:43.221 --> 23:44.322
Mommy.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.624
Trump will stop once he feels
he's won the argument.

23:46.657 --> 23:48.126
I feel like he's less interested

23:48.159 --> 23:50.462
in winning the argument

23:50.495 --> 23:53.598
than just having the argument
with you in public

23:53.631 --> 23:55.467
to prove he can
take on the establishment.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.135
I'm not the establishment.

23:57.168 --> 24:00.472
Honey, get real.
You are the establishment now.

24:00.505 --> 24:01.973
- Mommy!
- Not yet!

24:04.141 --> 24:07.912
You do understand
I have to be above this, right?

24:07.945 --> 24:09.647
I have to be an anchor first,
then a woman.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.982
You know the entire country

24:11.015 --> 24:13.685
is talking
about your period right now?

24:13.718 --> 24:15.653
- Mommy!
- What?

24:15.686 --> 24:17.522
- There's a man.
- What?

24:17.555 --> 24:19.132
- Yardley!
- Look. He's right there.

24:19.156 --> 24:20.801
- Yardley, where is he?
- Look. There he is.

24:20.825 --> 24:22.035
Oh, Jesus.
He's got a fucking camera!

24:22.059 --> 24:23.094
Come here, honey.

24:23.127 --> 24:24.204
No, no, no!
Don't open the door.

24:24.228 --> 24:25.572
They can't sell them
if we're inside.

24:25.596 --> 24:26.931
Get out. Get out of here! Go!

24:26.964 --> 24:27.966
Are you okay?

24:29.634 --> 24:30.902
What were you guys doing?

24:33.538 --> 24:35.106
- Mommy and Daddy?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:35.139 --> 24:37.742
Um...
It was a crossword...

24:37.775 --> 24:39.878
Mommy was just taking
a quick little nap.

24:39.911 --> 24:41.746
- Quick one.
- It wasn't that quick.

24:42.747 --> 24:45.149
I'm gonna have to
call Roger about security.

24:45.182 --> 24:46.827
<i>It's as clear as a bell</i>

24:46.851 --> 24:49.554
<i>that Mayhem Kelly has
gone over to the dark side.</i>

24:49.587 --> 24:51.289
<i>The more she sells out,</i>

24:51.322 --> 24:53.190
<i>the wider
her nostrils have become.</i>

24:53.224 --> 24:55.025
<i>Listen to
what I've just said to you.</i>

24:55.059 --> 24:55.927
He's here.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.129
<i>This woman was once pretty,</i>

24:58.162 --> 24:59.731
<i>and the more she has sold out,</i>

24:59.764 --> 25:01.108
<i>the wider
her nostrils have become.</i>

25:01.132 --> 25:02.667
<i>They're almost porcine.</i>

25:02.700 --> 25:04.669
<i>She snorts her insults
at America...</i>

25:04.702 --> 25:05.937
Roger!

25:05.970 --> 25:07.781
<i>And, as I say, it's now
the portrait of Dorian Kelly,</i>

25:07.805 --> 25:09.207
<i>not the portrait of Dorian Gray.</i>

25:09.240 --> 25:12.677
Give me a day to figure out
how we hit Trump back.

25:12.710 --> 25:13.811
Stop by later.

25:13.844 --> 25:15.647
I don't want my kids
hearing this crap.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.249
Ignore the damn morons.

25:18.082 --> 25:19.751
I'm old, fat, and ugly.

25:19.784 --> 25:22.153
Christ,
they call me Jabba the Hutt.

25:22.186 --> 25:26.624
Hemophilia swells my joints.
Can't exercise.

25:26.657 --> 25:28.927
I feel fine,
but I look like shit.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.229
I look the opposite
of how I feel.

25:31.262 --> 25:34.533
Do I let it affect me?
No, I do not.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.735
<i>This isn't entirely true.</i>

25:37.768 --> 25:39.170
<i>Roger is also fat</i>

25:39.203 --> 25:40.838
<i>because he'll get
a room-service menu</i>

25:40.871 --> 25:41.940
<i>and order page two.</i>

25:41.973 --> 25:44.008
No goddamn orange on Fox!

25:44.041 --> 25:45.842
<i>But he cares a lot about looks.</i>

25:45.876 --> 25:47.145
Fucking idiots.

25:47.178 --> 25:49.080
Let's turn our attention
to South Korea.

25:49.113 --> 25:50.248
South Korean officials say

25:50.281 --> 25:53.017
talks with the north have
adjourned until tomorrow...

25:53.050 --> 25:54.319
<i> Early on, he realized</i>

25:54.352 --> 25:56.354
<i>for a network to stay on
24 hours a day,</i>

25:56.387 --> 25:58.956
<i>you need something
to hold an audience.</i>

25:58.990 --> 26:00.158
Joining me to discuss

26:00.191 --> 26:01.960
the Korean peninsula
is Seth Choy...

26:01.993 --> 26:04.861
<i> That something is legs.</i>

26:04.895 --> 26:06.764
There's a reason
for clear desks.

26:07.898 --> 26:10.702
We need you in a shorter dress.

26:10.735 --> 26:11.845
<i> But you know
that they're gonna take...</i>

26:11.869 --> 26:13.871
Wide shot! Wider!

26:14.372 --> 26:15.673
Go to the wide shot!

26:15.706 --> 26:17.375
I want to see her goddamn legs.

26:17.408 --> 26:19.310
Why the fuck
do you think I hired her?

26:19.343 --> 26:20.721
<i> But this might
be seen by racial activists</i>

26:20.745 --> 26:22.046
<i>purely through the racial prism.</i>

26:25.149 --> 26:27.385
Uh, stand up and give me a spin.

26:27.418 --> 26:28.620
Really?

26:28.621 --> 26:29.821
Yeah, it's a visual medium.

26:35.159 --> 26:37.962
Yeah.
That's good. Sit down.

26:37.995 --> 26:39.831
I support the wall. I do.

26:39.864 --> 26:42.000
But mass deportations, come on.

26:42.033 --> 26:43.101
That'll never work

26:43.134 --> 26:45.336
because of the 14th Amendment.
You want me to quote it?

26:45.369 --> 26:46.870
"If you were born in America,

26:46.904 --> 26:48.873
"you're an American, period.
Period."

26:48.906 --> 26:50.841
Get me
a demographically friendly

26:50.875 --> 26:52.777
Hispanic woman on immigration.

26:52.810 --> 26:56.179
But, hey, she needs to be
very demographically friendly.

26:56.213 --> 26:58.750
Okay. Uh, new girl's up.
Kayla.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.285
Hi, sir.

27:01.318 --> 27:03.354
So, I was listening to
Rush Limbaugh this morning.

27:03.387 --> 27:06.224
He said something kind of cool
about Anthony Weiner.

27:06.257 --> 27:09.260
How he's an exhibitionist
in every aspect

27:09.293 --> 27:11.963
of how he presents himself
politically.

27:11.996 --> 27:13.031
Oh, my God.

27:13.064 --> 27:14.932
Is she the best
you can do?

27:14.965 --> 27:18.069
Bill Shine asked us
to give her a try, so...

27:18.102 --> 27:21.272
Okay, let's not lose
focus. Back to immigration.

27:21.972 --> 27:23.441
Oh, my gosh.

27:23.474 --> 27:24.841
I can't get fired.

27:24.875 --> 27:27.812
This is the only job
I have ever wanted.

27:27.845 --> 27:31.049
I don't wanna be on TV,
I wanna be on Fox.

27:31.082 --> 27:32.500
Uh-huh.

27:32.501 --> 27:33.918
My family, every day,

27:33.951 --> 27:36.354
every holiday,
especially holidays,

27:36.387 --> 27:37.822
they watch Fox News.

27:37.855 --> 27:39.691
We're like addicts.

27:39.724 --> 27:41.024
Fox is how we do church.

27:41.058 --> 27:42.335
You know when they made
the corner logo turn...

27:42.359 --> 27:43.460
The bug.

27:43.494 --> 27:46.063
Because folks had "Fox"
burned into their TV screens?

27:46.097 --> 27:47.198
That's us.

27:47.231 --> 27:48.800
Kayla, you're not getting fired.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.268
He cannot scale his anger.

27:50.301 --> 27:51.936
He's a perpetual
outrage machine.

27:51.969 --> 27:54.172
That's why crazies love him.
No offense to your family.

27:54.205 --> 27:56.474
You want to do the folders?
No crying at Fox.

27:56.507 --> 27:57.709
No crying.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.947
Let me explain
your mistake here.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.949
So, Rush is on Hannity's team.

28:04.982 --> 28:07.118
They're the competition.
They're GOP party hacks.

28:07.151 --> 28:08.720
So, he thinks
he's way ahead of them,

28:08.753 --> 28:10.955
so steal from Drudge
and Breitbart, not talk radio.

28:10.988 --> 28:11.923
Okay.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.824
Also, stop worrying
if the story's legit.

28:13.858 --> 28:14.892
If you can't source it,

28:14.925 --> 28:16.828
just go with,
"Some are saying."

28:16.861 --> 28:17.929
Seriously?

28:19.463 --> 28:20.764
You have to adopt

28:20.798 --> 28:22.400
the mentality of
an Irish street cop.

28:22.433 --> 28:25.436
The world is a bad place,
people are lazy morons,

28:25.469 --> 28:26.871
minorities are criminals,

28:26.904 --> 28:28.740
sex is sick, but interesting.

28:28.773 --> 28:31.141
Ask yourself, "What would
scare my grandmother,

28:31.175 --> 28:33.077
"or piss off my grandfather?"

28:33.110 --> 28:35.746
And that's a Fox story.
Are you writing this down?

28:35.780 --> 28:36.947
Oh, it makes so much sense.

28:36.981 --> 28:38.325
- Frighten, titillate.
- Right.

28:38.349 --> 28:41.519
Frighten, titillate.
Frighten, titillate.

28:41.552 --> 28:42.919
When you're starting the story,

28:42.953 --> 28:44.231
you need to start
with a clear villain.

28:45.923 --> 28:48.059
Liberal judge, pinhead mayor,

28:48.092 --> 28:49.193
Vermont, Hollywood.

28:49.194 --> 28:50.294
Uh-huh.

28:50.327 --> 28:51.996
Conservatives want to conserve.

28:52.029 --> 28:53.097
Uh-huh.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.165
You're the last defense

28:56.100 --> 28:58.302
against Jesus-hating,
trans-loving,

28:58.335 --> 29:01.939
Clinton-controlled
Armageddon, baby.

29:01.972 --> 29:03.908
Oh, come on.

29:03.941 --> 29:06.811
You do believe
some of that, right?

29:07.378 --> 29:08.413
Yeah.

29:09.513 --> 29:10.915
Uh...

29:17.288 --> 29:18.823
That's quite a face
you have.

29:18.856 --> 29:20.391
Really?

29:20.424 --> 29:22.127
Thank you.

29:23.460 --> 29:24.495
I'm drunk.

29:24.528 --> 29:25.997
I'm drunk as well.

29:31.836 --> 29:35.507
You have a Hillary poster
in your house.

29:36.373 --> 29:38.042
I guess I do.

29:39.376 --> 29:41.879
Okay, my parents
would be horrified

29:41.912 --> 29:43.281
if I went home with a Democrat.

29:44.849 --> 29:47.418
The lesbianism, however?

29:47.451 --> 29:49.053
Oh, I'm not a lesbian.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.088
I'm not a Democrat.

29:52.189 --> 29:55.460
I just have two giant
Hillary posters in my kitchen.

29:57.127 --> 29:58.830
As a joke, though, right?

29:58.863 --> 30:01.833
No. That's who
I'd like to be the President.

30:01.866 --> 30:03.601
Are you serious?

30:03.634 --> 30:06.204
I'm a closeted Democrat.

30:06.237 --> 30:07.839
At Fox News?

30:07.872 --> 30:09.540
Oh, my God.
I thought that you knew that.

30:09.573 --> 30:12.443
No, I didn't know that.
Does anyone know that?

30:12.476 --> 30:15.046
Can you not tell?
You can't tell anyone.

30:15.079 --> 30:16.919
- Of course I won't tell.
- No, I'm so serious.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.117
- Can I ask something?
- Mmm-hmm.

30:20.918 --> 30:22.520
Why do you work at Fox?

30:23.621 --> 30:27.091
Why don't you work
at MSNBC or something?

30:27.124 --> 30:31.329
I think I, like,
thrive in toxic environments.

30:31.362 --> 30:33.498
I never know
if you're kidding or not.

30:34.198 --> 30:35.233
I am kidding.

30:35.266 --> 30:37.435
I applied everywhere

30:37.468 --> 30:39.604
and I got a job at Fox.

30:39.637 --> 30:41.873
And I keep applying
to other places

30:41.906 --> 30:44.876
and they keep not taking me
because I work at Fox.

30:47.478 --> 30:48.913
Oh, my gosh.

30:50.147 --> 30:51.381
It's okay.

30:51.415 --> 30:53.951
One day I'm gonna be free.

30:53.984 --> 30:55.119
What? It's not that bad.

30:55.152 --> 30:58.356
If you're gay, it's pretty bad.

30:58.389 --> 31:01.324
Well, yeah, you don't
wanna be gay at Fox.

31:01.358 --> 31:04.995
You work for Bill O'Reilly
and you have a Hillary poster?

31:05.029 --> 31:05.964
You do know he likes to

31:05.997 --> 31:07.999
call up female producers
and whack off, right?

31:08.032 --> 31:09.100
Bill?

31:09.133 --> 31:10.501
Yes, Bill.

31:10.534 --> 31:11.635
No.

31:11.669 --> 31:13.647
You haven't heard about
the Andrea Mackris lawsuit?

31:13.671 --> 31:14.789
No.

31:14.790 --> 31:15.907
Oh, my God.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.475
This should be
in the welcome packet.

31:17.508 --> 31:19.977
She was one of
his associate producers.

31:20.010 --> 31:22.146
He took her, and only her,

31:22.179 --> 31:23.623
to the Republican
National Convention.

31:23.647 --> 31:25.349
Called her up at 11:00,

31:25.382 --> 31:26.350
touching himself

31:26.383 --> 31:28.352
and telling her
what he wanted to do to her

31:28.385 --> 31:30.087
with the old falafel.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.322
Are you kidding?

31:32.356 --> 31:34.125
It's on the internet.

31:34.158 --> 31:38.129
And then, quote, "using
a vibrator upon himself."

31:38.162 --> 31:41.399
Like, he brought a vibrator
from home to the convention?

31:41.432 --> 31:42.700
Yes, well, you have to bring

31:42.733 --> 31:44.177
a vibrator from home
to the convention.

31:46.503 --> 31:49.307
The question is, what does
a man do with a vibrator?

31:51.442 --> 31:53.978
Do you place it
alongside the shaft?

31:58.615 --> 32:00.651
I don't wanna hear that.

32:00.684 --> 32:02.253
"Fucking die, bitch."

32:03.253 --> 32:05.122
"If I see you,
you better run."

32:06.991 --> 32:09.160
"I wouldn't be sleeping
too soundly if I were you."

32:09.693 --> 32:11.195
Trump's lit the torches.

32:11.228 --> 32:13.597
You're getting security tonight.

32:13.630 --> 32:16.667
All I want is for this
to go away, Roger.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.636
Look, every general in history

32:18.669 --> 32:20.939
has gone into battle
feeling the same.

32:24.208 --> 32:25.209
Right.

32:26.744 --> 32:29.280
I'll read a statement
at the top, saying,

32:29.313 --> 32:32.350
"Yes, Trump is attacking me,
but I'm not going to respond."

32:32.383 --> 32:34.018
Any defense will come from you.

32:38.188 --> 32:39.290
Not right now.

32:40.591 --> 32:43.260
You set a record
on viewer email.

32:43.293 --> 32:44.294
Let me guess.

32:45.095 --> 32:46.597
None of it on my side.

32:47.264 --> 32:48.299
No.

32:48.332 --> 32:50.101
Our audience loves Trump.

32:50.134 --> 32:53.270
A hell of a lot more
than the Murdochs realize.

32:53.303 --> 32:55.006
More than Trump knows.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.142
He's tweeting we made peace.

32:58.175 --> 33:00.344
He'll come on <i> Fox & Friends</i>
tomorrow.

33:00.377 --> 33:02.346
He needs us.
We need him.

33:02.379 --> 33:03.715
It's got nothing to do with you.

33:07.317 --> 33:08.652
All right. It's late.

33:08.685 --> 33:10.355
I have dogs to feed.

33:26.703 --> 33:28.606
Just to be clear,

33:29.740 --> 33:33.110
I will not be
kissing Trump's ass at 9:00.

33:33.143 --> 33:36.180
We fight
tomorrow's fights tomorrow.

33:48.158 --> 33:49.761
Can I see
that statement again, Bill?

33:52.196 --> 33:54.665
Heard there was a dust-up
involving yours truly

33:54.698 --> 33:57.068
and presidential contender
Donald Trump.

33:58.368 --> 33:59.470
How you doing, Megyn?

34:02.306 --> 34:03.307
Hanging in there.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.344
Give him hell, Megyn.

34:13.050 --> 34:14.494
<i>Okay, quiet on the set.</i>

34:14.518 --> 34:18.056
<i>We go live in five, four,
three, two...</i>

34:19.422 --> 34:21.101
I just got back
from a weekend at the beach

34:21.125 --> 34:22.202
with my husband
and my three kids.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.137
Did anything happen
in the news while I was gone?

34:24.161 --> 34:25.605
You may have heard

34:25.629 --> 34:27.464
There was a dust-up
involving yours truly

34:27.498 --> 34:29.632
and presidential contender
Donald Trump.

34:29.666 --> 34:31.735
Mr. Trump was upset
with a question I asked...

34:32.835 --> 34:35.406
Oh, cute baby.

34:35.438 --> 34:38.109
I gotta say,
I can't stand your show.

34:38.574 --> 34:39.710
Oh.

34:40.444 --> 34:41.344
You guys at Fox,

34:41.379 --> 34:44.482
you're doing terrible things
to our country.

34:44.514 --> 34:46.384
Well, I hope
that makes you feel better.

34:47.784 --> 34:49.652
How you treat
people you disagree with

34:49.686 --> 34:51.522
says everything about you.

34:59.796 --> 35:02.466
<i>You know, I mean, Jesus was
a white man too, you know?</i>

35:02.499 --> 35:04.167
<i>It's like,
he was an historical figure.</i>

35:04.201 --> 35:05.445
<i>I mean,
that's a verifiable fact.</i>

35:05.469 --> 35:07.738
<i>As is Santa. I just want the
kids watching to know that.</i>

35:07.771 --> 35:10.374
<i>But my point is,
how do you just revise it</i>

35:10.407 --> 35:12.176
<i>and change Santa
from white to black?</i>

35:12.209 --> 35:14.009
<i>I mean, you can't. Not really.</i>

35:17.414 --> 35:18.883
Wow.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.651
Nice dress.

35:20.684 --> 35:23.187
I hope you don't
wear that to Sunday service.

35:23.220 --> 35:25.221
Please. I have church jeans,

35:25.255 --> 35:27.625
so I can hold a latte
on my knee.

35:29.193 --> 35:30.761
Oh, my God. Kayla.

35:30.794 --> 35:32.363
- Did you see this?
- What?

35:36.934 --> 35:38.236
I'm a creep.

35:39.469 --> 35:40.604
That is gross.

35:40.605 --> 35:41.739
I know.

35:41.772 --> 35:44.475
I love that.

35:47.711 --> 35:48.745
Are you crazy?

35:48.779 --> 35:49.914
What?

35:49.947 --> 35:52.150
That's my friend from college.

35:52.916 --> 35:54.685
I'm just looking out for you.

35:54.718 --> 35:56.252
Who are you stalking?

35:56.286 --> 35:57.288
No one.

36:11.602 --> 36:13.171
I feel for you.

36:13.837 --> 36:15.806
That show.

36:15.839 --> 36:18.475
Oh, his bark is worse
than his bite.

36:18.508 --> 36:19.910
Well, I work for Roger.

36:19.943 --> 36:22.480
We have two, three
and four-donut days.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.416
Sugar does make everybody crazy.

36:25.449 --> 36:26.750
No, these aren't donuts he eats.

36:26.783 --> 36:29.252
They're donuts he throws.
At somebody.

36:32.222 --> 36:35.693
No, he's a pussycat.

36:35.726 --> 36:38.762
Come say hi. We're always
looking for on-air talent.

36:38.795 --> 36:40.498
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

36:41.865 --> 36:42.866
Now?

36:44.868 --> 36:46.003
Sure.

36:51.308 --> 36:52.810
That's Roger's private elevator.

36:54.344 --> 36:56.214
Hang on a sec.

37:05.756 --> 37:06.924
Mmm-hmm.

37:08.058 --> 37:09.293
Hello.

37:09.326 --> 37:10.361
Ah, have a seat.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.395
Thank you.

37:13.430 --> 37:15.566
Liberals don't get Megyn.

37:15.599 --> 37:18.936
She's a star not because
she thinks Santa's white,

37:18.969 --> 37:20.971
- but because she'll say it.
- That's right.

37:21.004 --> 37:23.473
Yeah, few have courage
in the spotlight.

37:23.507 --> 37:24.942
It's powerful to watch.

37:24.975 --> 37:27.544
And she went up 30%
that quarter.

37:27.577 --> 37:29.647
Well, that, too.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.883
All audiences want
is authenticity.

37:32.916 --> 37:34.618
- Mmm.
- For 200 years,

37:34.651 --> 37:35.986
Santa's a fat white guy.

37:36.019 --> 37:37.754
They think Santa,

37:37.788 --> 37:38.865
- that's what they see.
- Right.

37:38.889 --> 37:40.724
You want to
change that? Fine.

37:40.757 --> 37:43.827
Let's discuss it without you
calling my people racist.

37:43.860 --> 37:44.961
Exactly.

37:44.995 --> 37:47.765
A liberal is somebody
who wants to live in a future

37:47.798 --> 37:49.799
that he is too lazy

37:49.833 --> 37:52.703
or too arrogant
to actually create.

37:52.736 --> 37:55.939
Well, in my family,
Santa's always been white

37:55.972 --> 37:59.376
and, according to my
granddaddy, a communist.

38:00.711 --> 38:02.879
So, that's my family.

38:04.848 --> 38:07.351
So, what can I do
for you, Kayla?

38:07.384 --> 38:10.087
Why did you drop by to see me?

38:10.120 --> 38:12.089
Well, the thing is, sir,

38:12.122 --> 38:14.491
I actually started on-air
during college

38:14.524 --> 38:16.627
in Central Florida. Weather.

38:16.660 --> 38:19.462
I want to convince you

38:19.496 --> 38:22.433
that that is where I belong, Mr. Ailes.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.768
I think I'd be freakin'
phenomenal on your network.

38:24.801 --> 38:27.505
Well, it's
Mr. Murdoch's air,

38:28.638 --> 38:32.009
but I did create it.
I do run it.

38:32.042 --> 38:33.077
Right.

38:33.110 --> 38:34.545
You have a pretty face.

38:36.513 --> 38:39.383
Here, uh, stand up
and give me a twirl.

38:39.416 --> 38:40.517
Now?

38:40.550 --> 38:42.619
Yeah.
Just a quick spin.

38:42.652 --> 38:44.088
Oh. Sure.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.566
That's very good.

38:56.666 --> 39:01.405
Now, uh, pull your dress up
and let me see your legs.

39:06.910 --> 39:08.011
Um...

39:15.452 --> 39:17.088
It's a visual medium, Kayla.

39:19.122 --> 39:20.124
Come on.

39:28.932 --> 39:30.067
Higher.

39:46.450 --> 39:47.852
Come on. Higher.

40:10.941 --> 40:12.143
That's fine, Kayla.

40:15.579 --> 40:16.781
Why don't you sit down?

40:28.124 --> 40:29.158
Thank you.

40:29.192 --> 40:30.194
Mmm-hmm.

40:31.928 --> 40:33.763
You have a great body.

40:33.797 --> 40:34.899
Thank you.

40:40.036 --> 40:41.439
Mr. Ailes...

40:43.006 --> 40:46.477
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention this...

40:46.510 --> 40:47.561
No, no, of course.

40:47.562 --> 40:48.612
To anyone.

40:48.645 --> 40:50.047
I'm here to help my employees,

40:50.080 --> 40:51.281
not hurt them.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.482
It would just sound...

40:52.516 --> 40:55.486
Anything that happens here,
in this room,

40:55.519 --> 40:58.689
is strictly between you and me.

40:58.722 --> 40:59.924
Okay.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.125
Of course, it cuts both ways.

41:02.726 --> 41:03.928
I'm discreet,

41:05.729 --> 41:07.598
but unforgiving.

41:16.873 --> 41:20.010
Success in
broadcast television

41:20.911 --> 41:22.813
is hard.
It's arbitrary.

41:22.846 --> 41:25.483
This is the most competitive
industry on earth.

41:26.850 --> 41:28.185
You understand what I'm saying?

41:28.218 --> 41:29.587
Mmm-hmm.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.622
We could work together.

41:33.757 --> 41:36.827
I could pluck you out
and move you

41:36.860 --> 41:38.929
all the way
to the front of the line.

41:40.964 --> 41:42.732
But I want something in return.

41:47.103 --> 41:49.206
Do you know what that is, Kayla?

41:53.043 --> 41:54.912
Loyalty.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.883
I need to know
that you're loyal.

42:00.951 --> 42:04.622
I need you to find a way to prove it.

42:06.222 --> 42:07.324
Mmm-hmm.

42:07.357 --> 42:09.026
You think about that, all right?

42:15.131 --> 42:16.767
So, we'll talk again?

42:18.635 --> 42:20.638
Faye can show you the way out.

42:21.137 --> 42:22.306
Thank you, sir.

42:44.928 --> 42:46.897
Jess. Jess.

42:51.868 --> 42:54.971
Something really weird
just happened.

42:56.206 --> 42:59.876
I just went to say hi to...

42:59.909 --> 43:03.814
I just... I met...
I was invited to meet Roger.

43:05.749 --> 43:06.917
I mean, nothing...

43:07.951 --> 43:09.686
Nothing happened.

43:09.719 --> 43:10.921
Kayla.

43:12.389 --> 43:14.691
It's actually better for you

43:14.724 --> 43:16.060
if you don't involve me in this.

43:18.862 --> 43:20.764
Um, 'cause they know
that we're friends.

43:22.098 --> 43:23.300
I'm sorry.

43:24.234 --> 43:25.235
Okay.

43:26.069 --> 43:27.237
This place is crazy.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.682
No Trump. No KKK.

43:38.715 --> 43:39.983
No fascist USA.

43:40.016 --> 43:41.952
- Jesus.
- Okay, we're here.

43:41.985 --> 43:43.663
<i>His assistant's name is Rhona.</i>

43:43.687 --> 43:45.288
<i>The security guard is Keith...</i>

43:45.321 --> 43:46.356
Got it.

43:46.389 --> 43:49.059
Gil, last words?

43:49.092 --> 43:51.028
<i> Yeah, don't piss him off.
I need this job.</i>

43:51.461 --> 43:52.796
<i>Good luck.</i>

43:52.829 --> 43:54.131
I'll be waiting
right here, okay?

44:05.408 --> 44:06.568
Are you
happy now, bitch?

44:09.379 --> 44:11.448
<i> During the day,
if I'm in the office,</i>

44:11.481 --> 44:13.216
<i>I have a number of people</i>

44:13.249 --> 44:14.750
<i>that I'll just call out
a tweet to.</i>

44:14.784 --> 44:16.028
<i>It's always my right.</i>

44:16.052 --> 44:17.797
<i>You probably had some pretty
nasty tweets sent your way.</i>

44:17.821 --> 44:18.931
<i>I don't want that to happen.</i>

44:18.955 --> 44:20.166
<i>I have fans that really love...</i>

44:20.190 --> 44:23.026
<i>But you retweet some of those.
It's not just the fans.</i>

44:23.059 --> 44:24.695
<i> But not
the more nasty ones.</i>

44:24.728 --> 44:26.830
<i>You would be amazed
at the ones I don't retweet.</i>

44:26.863 --> 44:28.397
<i>"Bimbo"?</i>

44:28.431 --> 44:31.935
<i>Uh, well, that was a retweet.
Yeah, did I say that?</i>

44:31.968 --> 44:33.337
<i>Many times.</i>

44:33.338 --> 44:34.705
<i>Ooh, okay. Excuse me.</i>

44:36.306 --> 44:38.275
<i> But not the most
horrible thing, you know.</i>

44:38.308 --> 44:40.911
<i>Over your life, Megyn, you've
been called a lot worse.</i>

44:40.944 --> 44:42.488
- <i>Is that right?</i>
- All right, that's enough.

44:42.512 --> 44:44.247
<i>It's not about me.
It's not about me.</i>

44:44.280 --> 44:46.216
Well, what do you think?

44:47.917 --> 44:50.020
I think you're too solicitous.

44:50.053 --> 44:51.888
Thank you.

44:51.921 --> 44:54.124
But this once, I can handle
a straight-up positive.

44:54.157 --> 44:55.859
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

44:55.892 --> 44:59.261
He attacks you
for a year straight

44:59.295 --> 45:02.165
and you let him off
with a fucking "oops."

45:02.198 --> 45:04.267
What?
I don't let him off.

45:04.300 --> 45:07.838
I confront him.
I used Donald Trump.

45:07.871 --> 45:09.840
Honey, you absolved him.

45:09.873 --> 45:11.174
Doug, there are internal

45:11.207 --> 45:12.909
political pressures
at play here as well.

45:12.942 --> 45:14.778
Yeah, yeah. I bet.
I get it, Gil.

45:14.811 --> 45:16.255
You know what,
can we have a second, guys?

45:16.279 --> 45:17.448
Please.

45:21.985 --> 45:23.920
I'm not trying to be critical.
I just...

45:23.953 --> 45:25.989
Well, you are.
I made this go away.

45:26.022 --> 45:29.159
I stopped his
harassing bullshit. For us.

45:29.192 --> 45:31.461
I never asked you to do that.

45:31.494 --> 45:32.763
He is going to be

45:32.796 --> 45:34.397
the Republican candidate
for President.

45:34.430 --> 45:36.265
I'm a news anchor.
I need access to him.

45:36.299 --> 45:38.969
You need access?
At what fucking price?

45:39.002 --> 45:42.939
At what price? The price
of our apartment. My salary.

45:42.972 --> 45:45.309
That pays our fucking bills.

45:55.351 --> 45:57.220
- Look. For the record...
- No. You know what?

45:57.253 --> 45:58.789
It's been a shitty year!

46:00.223 --> 46:01.858
Really fucking shitty year,

46:01.891 --> 46:04.060
and I'm allowed to want it over.

46:05.228 --> 46:06.296
You are.

46:08.064 --> 46:09.899
Fuck.

46:09.933 --> 46:12.435
So, what I'm saying is,
do we really need AR-15s

46:12.468 --> 46:14.069
to be able to hunt deer,

46:14.103 --> 46:15.138
protect our families?

46:15.171 --> 46:19.475
I'm in favor of people
being able to carry handguns.

46:19.509 --> 46:21.453
Some of these mass shootings
would have been less deadly

46:21.477 --> 46:22.913
if that had been the case.

46:22.946 --> 46:26.216
But I'm also with
the majority today,

46:26.249 --> 46:29.553
taking a stand against
semiautomatic assault weapons.

46:29.586 --> 46:31.430
Which brings us back
to the question of the day.

46:31.454 --> 46:35.959
Should Congress reinstate
the Assault Weapons Ban?

46:35.992 --> 46:38.328
I know a lot of you
don't agree with me.

46:38.962 --> 46:40.030
That's fine.

46:41.931 --> 46:42.933
Huh.

46:43.900 --> 46:45.402
89% of you say no.

46:47.370 --> 46:49.373
And that's what makes
America great.

46:51.941 --> 46:53.581
- Clear.
- Great.

46:53.610 --> 46:55.479
The second floor
wants to see you.

46:56.546 --> 46:57.915
- Now?
- Yeah.

47:02.318 --> 47:03.487
This is Kayla.

47:05.622 --> 47:07.124
Hi.

47:08.892 --> 47:10.359
Mmm-hmm.

47:14.197 --> 47:16.033
Yeah. I'll come
right up then.

48:25.568 --> 48:26.570
Ladies.

48:27.537 --> 48:28.571
Hi.

48:50.460 --> 48:51.662
Phew. Hot in here.

49:19.722 --> 49:22.292
Gretchen.
Well, how are you?

49:22.325 --> 49:23.994
Faye, I miss our lunches.

49:23.995 --> 49:25.662
Mmm.

49:25.695 --> 49:27.430
Roger wants to see me?

49:27.431 --> 49:29.165
Oh.

49:29.198 --> 49:31.167
Uh, no, I think it was Dianne.

49:32.502 --> 49:34.182
I just saw her in with Bill.

49:35.171 --> 49:37.107
All right. Well...

49:40.276 --> 49:41.644
See you ladies later then.

49:41.677 --> 49:43.279
Bye.

49:43.312 --> 49:45.080
Roger's ready
for you, Kayla.

49:46.616 --> 49:48.084
Okay.

49:56.692 --> 49:59.029
Never stops.

49:59.062 --> 50:01.364
Gretchen, you've been
such an instrumental part

50:01.397 --> 50:02.532
of the Fox family.

50:02.565 --> 50:04.234
Absolutely.

50:04.267 --> 50:05.468
We just wanted to tell you

50:05.501 --> 50:07.437
that we appreciated the work...

50:07.470 --> 50:09.071
He's firing me, isn't he?

50:11.641 --> 50:12.642
Yes.

50:16.813 --> 50:18.348
You wanna tell me why?

50:27.857 --> 50:29.359
<i>What could they say?</i>

50:29.392 --> 50:31.495
<i>"You're sexy,
but you're too much work.</i>

50:32.595 --> 50:34.663
<i>"You're a man-hater.</i>

50:34.697 --> 50:37.401
<i>"To get ahead
you gotta give a little head."</i>

50:43.439 --> 50:45.774
Good luck, Ms. Carlson.

50:45.808 --> 50:48.211
<i> Do you know why
we dress soldiers the same?</i>

50:48.244 --> 50:50.380
<i>So everybody knows
they're replaceable.</i>

50:53.282 --> 50:54.684
<i>I refuse to be replaceable.</i>

50:59.288 --> 51:01.491
Well, they finally
did it. I'm out.

51:01.524 --> 51:02.601
<i> Did they
give you a cause?</i>

51:02.625 --> 51:04.194
No.

51:04.195 --> 51:05.762
<i>Good. Ready to go to war?</i>

51:05.795 --> 51:08.231
Oh, yeah.
I'm ready.

51:23.613 --> 51:24.647
Murdoch here.

51:24.681 --> 51:26.616
<i> Funny.
Have you seen the lawsuit?</i>

51:26.649 --> 51:28.250
Which lawsuit?

51:31.721 --> 51:32.822
I'm not stopping.

51:32.856 --> 51:35.258
<i> Roger's being sued
for sexual harassment</i>

51:35.291 --> 51:36.726
by Gretchen Carlson.

51:38.794 --> 51:40.230
Where's Dad?

51:40.263 --> 51:41.264
<i>Paris.</i>

51:45.503 --> 51:46.536
Yeah.

51:46.569 --> 51:48.380
<i> I have your
father's attorney for you.</i>

51:48.404 --> 51:49.406
Thank you.

51:50.239 --> 51:51.274
<i> Morning.</i>

51:51.307 --> 51:54.176
<i>So, this employee
has sued Roger personally.</i>

51:56.279 --> 51:57.814
He doesn't know who she is.

51:58.948 --> 52:00.817
Are you familiar
with Ms. Carlson?

52:00.850 --> 52:03.252
No. Until two hours ago,
I'd never heard of her.

52:03.286 --> 52:06.156
More importantly, no one heard
from her after she was fired.

52:06.189 --> 52:08.158
Wait. Not even to negotiate a severance?

52:08.191 --> 52:09.392
<i>No. And that suggests</i>

52:09.425 --> 52:12.262
she knew it was coming
and she had a plan.

52:12.295 --> 52:14.731
<i>As News Corp attorney,
I recommend you conduct</i>

52:14.764 --> 52:17.300
<i>an internal investigation
into Roger's behavior.</i>

52:17.333 --> 52:20.436
I know you two
have had issues with him.

52:20.469 --> 52:23.373
I need everyone's attention.
Listen up, people!

52:23.406 --> 52:27.442
A <i> Post</i> employee has received
a package of anthrax.

52:27.476 --> 52:28.720
That's just above us.

52:28.744 --> 52:30.280
Close the goddamn vents!

52:30.313 --> 52:31.347
All of them!

52:31.380 --> 52:32.465
Roger.

52:32.466 --> 52:33.550
And nobody opens the mail!

52:33.583 --> 52:35.418
- Roger.
- We're under attack!

52:35.451 --> 52:37.353
Roger! Hey!

52:37.386 --> 52:39.788
Everything upstairs
is under control.

52:39.822 --> 52:41.391
You need to calm down.

52:42.158 --> 52:44.761
Do not give orders
in my newsroom.

52:44.794 --> 52:46.895
If it were yours,

52:46.929 --> 52:48.198
you'd own it.

52:51.300 --> 52:54.504
It's okay, everyone. Everything's gonna be fine.
You can go back to work.

52:54.537 --> 52:55.538
Thank you.

52:59.709 --> 53:01.810
Uh-huh. Yeah,
let's look into her claims.

53:01.844 --> 53:02.846
<i> Done.</i>

53:20.263 --> 53:21.281
Hi.

53:21.282 --> 53:22.298
Hi.

53:22.331 --> 53:24.501
Oh, my God, it's Anchor Barbie.

53:25.635 --> 53:27.504
I'm testing for Fox Business.

53:29.939 --> 53:32.375
Holy fucking Christ!

53:35.511 --> 53:36.713
I'll call you right back.

53:37.913 --> 53:39.482
Pull up <i> The New York Times</i>
right now.

53:39.515 --> 53:40.626
- Whoa.
- What's going on?

53:40.650 --> 53:42.285
Holy shit!

53:42.318 --> 53:43.453
Did you see this?

53:46.656 --> 53:48.725
Holy shit!

53:48.758 --> 53:50.259
Oh, my God.

53:50.293 --> 53:51.661
<i> The Times?</i>

53:53.029 --> 53:54.397
No way.

53:57.500 --> 54:00.370
Josh. Get me a nice shot
from Main Street.

54:00.403 --> 54:01.504
No Priuses in it.

54:01.505 --> 54:02.605
Right.

54:02.638 --> 54:05.842
When you're photographing
for my paper, don't wear a hoodie.

54:06.876 --> 54:08.645
Okay.

54:08.678 --> 54:09.980
Hoodies are creepy.

54:10.547 --> 54:12.349
Thank you. Thank you.

54:19.655 --> 54:20.723
What is that?

54:20.756 --> 54:23.359
Oh, uh,
just grocery-store sushi.

54:24.060 --> 54:25.295
Mmm.

54:26.062 --> 54:27.998
Sushi's not liberal food.

54:28.864 --> 54:30.933
I didn't say that it was.

54:34.904 --> 54:36.105
Hi, love.

54:36.139 --> 54:38.808
<i> Go home right now
and don't talk to anybody.</i>

54:38.841 --> 54:40.576
What? Wait, Roger...

54:40.609 --> 54:43.613
<i>I'm leaving now.
Go home. I'll meet you there.</i>

54:43.646 --> 54:45.715
- What?
<i>- Fox News host Gretchen Carlson</i>

54:45.748 --> 54:48.584
<i>Has filed a lawsuit against
the network's CEO Roger Ailes,</i>

54:48.617 --> 54:50.453
<i>claiming she was fired
because she was...</i>

54:50.486 --> 54:53.388
Fox News chairman Roger Ailes
is responding to a lawsuit

54:53.422 --> 54:55.692
filed by lawyers
for Gretchen Carlson...

54:55.725 --> 54:56.902
<i>Alleges she was fired</i>

54:56.926 --> 54:58.694
<i>after turning down
sexual advances.</i>

54:58.728 --> 55:00.105
<i>Carlson claimed in the lawsuit</i>

55:00.129 --> 55:02.732
<i>that Ailes took her off
the popular morning show,</i>

55:02.765 --> 55:04.901
Fox & Friends,<i> in 2013,</i>

55:04.934 --> 55:06.769
<i>cut her pay and placed her</i>

55:06.802 --> 55:09.505
<i>in a less desirable
afternoon time slot</i>

55:09.538 --> 55:10.907
<i>because she refused to have</i>

55:10.940 --> 55:12.842
<i>a sexual relationship with him.</i>

55:12.875 --> 55:15.412
<i>The lawsuit was filed
in New Jersey State Court.</i>

55:23.452 --> 55:25.888
Champ's making his rounds.

55:25.921 --> 55:26.923
Good boy.

55:28.023 --> 55:29.025
Are you okay?

55:30.793 --> 55:31.795
No.

55:45.474 --> 55:46.885
<i> Beth,
I just talked to</i> TheWrap.

55:46.909 --> 55:49.612
It's an online publication.
I said, how sad it is

55:49.645 --> 55:52.515
we've got this woman
making these complaints

55:52.548 --> 55:55.417
when there are real victims
out there.

55:55.451 --> 55:57.019
I know, Roger.
I told <i> People</i> magazine

55:57.052 --> 55:59.722
we've been in your office
alone a lot over 15 years.

55:59.755 --> 56:01.566
I've never seen anything
like what I'm reading about.

56:01.590 --> 56:03.126
I said, "I don't think
Gretchen Carlson

56:03.159 --> 56:04.060
"has a friend
in the building."

56:04.094 --> 56:05.928
I know, Roger.
Someone would've told me.

56:05.961 --> 56:07.172
They're gonna quote me on that.

56:07.196 --> 56:08.331
Not a ring of truth.

56:08.364 --> 56:11.434
Maria Bartiromo
sent <i> Variety</i> a stock chart.

56:11.467 --> 56:12.945
- Oh, hey, we're up.
- Whoo-hoo.

56:12.969 --> 56:15.547
Hannity tweeted,
"I talked to hundreds of women at Fox this week,

56:15.571 --> 56:16.773
"both on air and off.

56:16.806 --> 56:18.441
"They say it all BS."

56:18.474 --> 56:19.985
- Brit Hume, too.
- Brit?

56:20.009 --> 56:21.978
"Why didn't Gretchen
quit and sue

56:22.011 --> 56:24.013
"instead of suing
only after she got fired?

56:24.046 --> 56:25.086
"Why didn't she complain?"

56:25.114 --> 56:26.783
Why didn't she complain?
Really?

56:26.816 --> 56:28.451
He means the anonymous hotline.

56:28.484 --> 56:29.886
- There's a hotline?
- Yeah.

56:29.919 --> 56:32.020
I did
the harassment seminar twice.

56:32.054 --> 56:33.131
I never heard about a hotline.

56:33.155 --> 56:34.390
Because it's bullshit.

56:34.423 --> 56:37.125
They have a contractual right
to monitor our communications.

56:37.159 --> 56:40.630
A hotline in this building
is like a complaint box in occupied Paris.

56:42.064 --> 56:45.033
It's like we're telling women,
"Go on. Speak up for yourself.

56:45.067 --> 56:48.070
"Just know the entire network
is with Roger."

56:48.103 --> 56:49.939
No one will believe you.

56:49.972 --> 56:51.674
They'll call you a liar.

56:51.707 --> 56:54.777
Oh, and as for your career,
you want assignments and air time?

56:54.810 --> 56:56.145
Go ahead.
Call the paranoid man

56:56.178 --> 56:57.712
who decides your salary
a pervert,

56:57.746 --> 57:00.450
and do that on a fucking
anonymous hotline he controls.

57:00.483 --> 57:03.119
On a phone he has
a contractual right to record.

57:03.152 --> 57:05.721
Jesus fucking Christ,
do you think women are idiots?

57:05.754 --> 57:07.457
It's like
somebody stripped you naked

57:07.490 --> 57:08.867
and they want you
to walk through this office

57:08.891 --> 57:10.493
just to fucking prove it.

57:11.093 --> 57:12.095
Okay.

57:14.096 --> 57:16.132
Can I see you for a minute?

57:25.207 --> 57:27.009
What the fuck was that?

57:27.042 --> 57:28.778
I don't know, but I liked it.

57:35.150 --> 57:36.953
I won't call you a feminist,

57:36.986 --> 57:39.020
but say there's a spectrum,
you are...

57:39.054 --> 57:40.690
Roger harassed me.

57:43.292 --> 57:44.694
Ten years ago.

57:46.795 --> 57:48.931
I had turned down
a law-firm partnership

57:48.964 --> 57:52.000
for an entry-level job
here at Fox.

57:52.034 --> 57:55.772
Roger would call me up to
New York to dangle prospects.

57:57.706 --> 57:58.942
I wanted his help.

58:02.745 --> 58:03.746
Did you

58:04.880 --> 58:06.015
do anything?

58:06.849 --> 58:08.885
No.

58:09.585 --> 58:10.787
Will you talk?

58:13.722 --> 58:15.558
- Megyn?
- I don't know.

58:15.591 --> 58:16.692
I don't know.

58:19.762 --> 58:21.531
I mean, going on the record...

58:22.898 --> 58:25.568
Jesus.

58:25.601 --> 58:28.170
It's basically admitting
you're the weak one in the herd.

58:28.203 --> 58:31.240
No, it's admitting
you're the hot one.

58:31.273 --> 58:32.909
It has nothing
to do with that, Gil.

58:32.942 --> 58:34.677
- Say women.
- Oh, my God.

58:34.710 --> 58:35.945
Look, there is a reason

58:35.978 --> 58:37.780
certain women can defend Roger.

58:37.813 --> 58:40.016
If I report this and it leaks,

58:40.049 --> 58:42.652
it will follow me
for the rest of my career.

58:42.685 --> 58:44.195
I don't wanna be defined
by Roger's bullshit.

58:44.219 --> 58:47.723
I refuse to be the fucking poster girl
for sexual harassment.

58:47.756 --> 58:50.692
He can't still be doing
that crap, right?

58:50.726 --> 58:51.886
I mean, the man has a walker.

58:52.995 --> 58:54.830
- Viagra?
- Gil.

58:55.998 --> 58:57.267
Help me here.

58:58.200 --> 59:00.303
Please. How do I play this?

59:02.104 --> 59:05.575
Well, you only ask
when you already know.

59:08.077 --> 59:09.879
If I learned anything this year,

59:09.912 --> 59:11.089
it's to not get sucked
into a fight

59:11.113 --> 59:13.394
with someone who has better reason
to be in it than you do.

59:15.117 --> 59:16.185
Okay.

59:17.853 --> 59:19.055
Okay.

59:20.856 --> 59:22.692
So, what is it you wanna do?

59:24.827 --> 59:26.596
For right now, nothing.

59:26.629 --> 59:27.797
- Good.
- Good.

59:49.818 --> 59:51.787
There she is.

59:51.820 --> 59:53.723
Hi, Roger.

59:53.756 --> 59:55.091
Hello, sweetheart.

59:57.259 --> 59:58.794
Hi.

59:58.827 --> 59:59.829
Sit, sit.

01:00:00.896 --> 01:00:04.000
- You've met Mayor Giuliani before?
- Of course.

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:06.002
There's
an internal investigation,

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:08.004
but I'm not gonna wait for it
to clear me.

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:10.740
The Republican convention
is less than two weeks away.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:13.109
This is bullshit.
I'm gonna fight it.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:14.777
The charges are absurd.

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.345
I'm in, Roger.

01:00:16.378 --> 01:00:18.981
I love that fate has given me
a chance to repay you

01:00:19.014 --> 01:00:20.716
for when I was
in intensive care.

01:00:20.749 --> 01:00:24.053
Roger called my idiot doctors
every day for four weeks.

01:00:24.086 --> 01:00:25.363
Told them he'd put me on the air

01:00:25.387 --> 01:00:26.398
live from the hospital bed

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:29.291
if they didn't fix
every stitch of damage done.

01:00:29.324 --> 01:00:31.927
But I'm also here as someone

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.196
who has dealt with this issue
for years,

01:00:34.229 --> 01:00:37.667
years on the side of women.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.968
I don't wanna see
sexual violence trivialized.

01:00:40.002 --> 01:00:43.939
I don't wanna see it become
some damn political football.

01:00:43.972 --> 01:00:47.143
In that spirit, I need to ask,

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:49.979
will an investigation
find anything,

01:00:50.012 --> 01:00:52.081
well, uncomfortable?

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:57.086
Well, define uncomfortable.

01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:58.421
Roger, quote,

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:00.022
"I think you and I
should have had

01:01:00.055 --> 01:01:02.290
"a sexual relationship
a long time ago.

01:01:02.324 --> 01:01:03.859
"And then
you'd be good and better

01:01:03.892 --> 01:01:05.003
"and I'd be good and better."

01:01:05.027 --> 01:01:06.612
Did you say that?

01:01:06.613 --> 01:01:08.197
No, I'm not a fool.

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:11.100
"You missed your chance for me
to harass you"? Come on.

01:01:11.133 --> 01:01:12.868
I think they'll argue
it's solicitous.

01:01:12.901 --> 01:01:16.372
Telling a woman she was
fuckable "a long time ago."

01:01:16.405 --> 01:01:18.074
Who the hell thinks that works?

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:19.742
Why's she suing, Roger?

01:01:19.775 --> 01:01:22.344
Gretchen is
a very competitive woman

01:01:22.377 --> 01:01:24.279
facing a severe
likability issue.

01:01:25.347 --> 01:01:29.051
One that I shielded her from
for years.

01:01:29.084 --> 01:01:30.886
Her career's over, I'm afraid.

01:01:30.919 --> 01:01:32.187
And she can't take
a joke.

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:34.156
Roger is very salty.

01:01:34.189 --> 01:01:38.060
I find it amusing.
It's my fault. I encourage it.

01:01:38.093 --> 01:01:41.263
James Murdoch
could be behind this.

01:01:41.296 --> 01:01:43.432
His wife
openly supports Hillary.

01:01:43.465 --> 01:01:45.334
And it could go deeper.

01:01:45.367 --> 01:01:47.236
I have good reason to believe

01:01:47.269 --> 01:01:49.370
that inside
the Obama White House,

01:01:49.404 --> 01:01:50.740
there have been discussions,

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.742
on what level I do not know...

01:01:54.209 --> 01:01:55.477
of having me killed.

01:02:46.461 --> 01:02:47.763
Oh, Jesus.

01:02:50.866 --> 01:02:52.068
- Hi, there.
- Hey.

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.338
Roger needs you.

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:57.974
Your silence is being noticed.

01:03:00.242 --> 01:03:02.144
Well, the whole point
of an investigation

01:03:02.177 --> 01:03:03.879
is to find the truth, Jeanine.

01:03:03.912 --> 01:03:05.981
Until that happens,
I don't have a lot to say.

01:03:06.014 --> 01:03:08.250
If this charge sticks,

01:03:08.283 --> 01:03:09.884
the working assumption will be,

01:03:09.918 --> 01:03:12.922
"Every woman at Fox got down
on her knees."

01:03:13.889 --> 01:03:15.457
Even you.

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:17.459
If we sweep this thing
under the rug, Jeanine,

01:03:17.492 --> 01:03:19.094
and it happens again,

01:03:19.127 --> 01:03:20.596
under Title Seven,

01:03:20.629 --> 01:03:21.897
Fox will be liable

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:24.332
for compensatory
and punitive damages.

01:03:24.366 --> 01:03:26.001
That could be
hundreds of millions.

01:03:26.034 --> 01:03:28.404
Let's worry about the law
before we do the PR, okay?

01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:31.240
Does Roger want us?

01:03:31.273 --> 01:03:34.043
Yes. He's a man.

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:36.512
He also gave us time.

01:03:36.545 --> 01:03:38.480
He gave us opportunity.

01:03:38.513 --> 01:03:40.516
We benefited
from that kind of attention.

01:03:44.186 --> 01:03:45.888
I mean, Jeanine Pirro?

01:03:45.921 --> 01:03:48.624
She's the founding member
of Team Roger.

01:03:48.657 --> 01:03:49.901
You're not answering your phone.

01:03:49.925 --> 01:03:51.160
No, I'm holding it.

01:03:51.193 --> 01:03:53.028
Okay, well, everybody's
still looking for you.

01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:56.465
- Where were any of these people to defend me from Trump, hmm?
- Excuse me.

01:03:56.498 --> 01:03:57.867
Bill Shine told them not to.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.935
What the fuck?

01:03:59.968 --> 01:04:01.604
Our boss.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.339
Why are you guys in the hall?

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:04.973
I got a call from Roger's lawyer

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:07.142
saying to, quote, "relax."

01:04:07.175 --> 01:04:09.215
They're convincing Rupert
to limit the investigation

01:04:09.244 --> 01:04:10.646
to Gretchen and her team.

01:04:10.679 --> 01:04:12.948
That's only five or six women.

01:04:12.981 --> 01:04:14.383
Are you gonna let that happen?

01:04:22.557 --> 01:04:25.026
I like Roger. I do.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:25.995
I know.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:28.663
Even if he can be controlling
and vindictive.

01:04:28.697 --> 01:04:31.367
Those sins aren't really
the problem, Meg.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.402
I mean, there were
hundreds of stories

01:04:33.435 --> 01:04:35.170
of Roger paying
an employee's rehab,

01:04:35.203 --> 01:04:37.640
or keeping somebody
terminally ill on payroll.

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:40.341
You remember when Shep came out.

01:04:40.375 --> 01:04:41.610
All Roger said was,

01:04:41.643 --> 01:04:42.720
"I don't care
where you put your pecker,

01:04:42.744 --> 01:04:44.947
"as long as you don't tell me
where to put mine."

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.549
Again, not the most redeeming.

01:04:47.582 --> 01:04:51.086
He promoted me,
he looked past the rejection,

01:04:51.119 --> 01:04:54.189
he looked past the risk
of this exact conversation.

01:04:54.222 --> 01:04:56.225
He handed me the power
to hurt him.

01:05:25.687 --> 01:05:26.905
Morning.

01:05:26.906 --> 01:05:28.123
<i> Hi, Megyn.</i>

01:05:28.156 --> 01:05:31.259
We need to get
Gerson Zweifach on the phone.

01:05:31.293 --> 01:05:33.262
<i>Gerson, I'm calling for Roger.</i>

01:05:33.295 --> 01:05:35.264
<i>He wants me to be
part of your investigation.</i>

01:05:35.297 --> 01:05:37.066
We've decided
on an outside firm.

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:40.569
No, why? Gerson, we can
handle this ourselves.

01:05:40.602 --> 01:05:42.203
I'm asking Paul/Weiss.

01:05:42.237 --> 01:05:43.238
<i>Paul/Weiss?</i>

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:46.342
You tell them that
I can actively participate.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:49.378
Mr. Giuliani,
you're an old friend of Roger.

01:05:49.411 --> 01:05:50.512
You married them.

01:05:50.545 --> 01:05:52.348
<i>Sharing information with you</i>

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:54.359
<i>will remove the cloak
of attorney-client privilege,</i>

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:56.317
making the testimony
of any woman

01:05:56.351 --> 01:05:58.620
who comes forward
subject to discovery.

01:05:58.653 --> 01:06:01.189
I understand.
You get me a waiver.

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:02.533
I will not structure
this investigation

01:06:02.557 --> 01:06:05.259
so Roger isn't perceived of
as its target.

01:06:05.293 --> 01:06:07.496
<i>You want him to look guilty?</i>

01:06:07.529 --> 01:06:09.198
Well, that depends
on what we find.

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:15.170
You know a reporter,
Gabe Sherman?

01:06:15.203 --> 01:06:16.255
No.

01:06:16.256 --> 01:06:17.306
You're about to.

01:06:17.339 --> 01:06:18.507
He's found six women

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.375
who claim Roger Ailes
harassed them.

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:23.112
All from before Roger
founded Fox News.

01:06:25.447 --> 01:06:27.016
<i> This was years ago.</i>

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:28.717
<i>He said he would
put me on the show,</i>

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.486
<i>but I had to go to bed with him.</i>

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:33.689
<i>And I just said, "Yeah, right.
You and who else?"</i>

01:06:33.722 --> 01:06:35.424
<i>And he said, "Just me</i>

01:06:35.457 --> 01:06:37.993
<i>"and a few of
my preferred friends."</i>

01:06:39.327 --> 01:06:42.197
<i> I came in
and he closed the door,</i>

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:43.532
<i>turned, and kissed me.</i>

01:06:43.565 --> 01:06:45.267
<i>Like I was his girlfriend.</i>

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.702
<i>Like he knew it was coming.</i>

01:06:46.735 --> 01:06:48.604
<i>He grabbed my tits and he said,</i>

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:52.074
<i>"Look, no girl gets a job here
unless they're cooperative."</i>

01:06:53.108 --> 01:06:54.819
<i>- in New York City
- "If you wanna make it</i>

01:06:54.843 --> 01:06:56.211
<i>"In the TV business,</i>

01:06:56.244 --> 01:06:57.613
<i>"you're gonna have to fuck me.</i>

01:06:57.646 --> 01:06:58.823
<i>"And you're gonna have to
do that</i>

01:06:58.847 --> 01:07:00.416
<i>"with anyone I tell you to."</i>

01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:02.751
<i> He finishes the test,</i>

01:07:02.784 --> 01:07:04.753
<i>which is me pretending to cook,</i>

01:07:04.786 --> 01:07:07.122
<i>then he pulls out
a garter belt and stockings</i>

01:07:07.155 --> 01:07:08.724
<i>and says, "Put these on."</i>

01:07:08.757 --> 01:07:11.794
<i>So, yeah, well, I put them on.</i>

01:07:12.861 --> 01:07:14.363
<i> And he said,</i>

01:07:14.396 --> 01:07:15.764
<i>"You know,
I can really help you,</i>

01:07:15.797 --> 01:07:17.733
<i>"but if you wanna play
with the big boys,</i>

01:07:17.766 --> 01:07:20.069
<i>"you have to lay
with the big boys."</i>

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:22.071
<i>It was very transactional.</i>

01:07:23.605 --> 01:07:26.809
<i> It was quiet.
He stared at me.</i>

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:29.178
<i>He undid his pants</i>

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:33.214
<i>and took out his penis
very gingerly.</i>

01:07:33.248 --> 01:07:35.517
<i>I had never seen one.</i>

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:37.586
<i>I was scared.</i>

01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:40.689
<i>Then he said, "Kiss it."</i>

01:07:40.722 --> 01:07:42.324
<i>I was 16.</i>

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.637
<i> Former anchor
Gretchen Carlson</i>

01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:48.530
<i>filing a sexual-harassment
lawsuit</i>

01:07:48.563 --> 01:07:50.666
<i>against Fox News
chief Roger Ailes.</i>

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.301
<i>More women are coming forward.</i>

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:53.611
<i>Ailes is denying the allegations</i>

01:07:53.635 --> 01:07:55.146
<i>and getting
some high-profile support...</i>

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:57.315
<i> The accusations
against Roger Ailes are growing...</i>

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:59.341
<i> I have never run
a goddamn Dairy Queen.</i>

01:07:59.374 --> 01:08:02.477
<i>You don't get to go
and get whatever you want.</i>

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:05.647
<i>Everybody on my shows
knows the meaning of decency,</i>

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.883
<i>and I do mean everybody.</i>

01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:11.386
A TV outfit needs tough,
confident women.

01:08:11.419 --> 01:08:13.788
Do I push them?
You bet your ass I do.

01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:17.259
But have I ever demanded sex
during a casting session?

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:20.295
Have I offered extra pay
for blowjobs?

01:08:20.328 --> 01:08:23.899
Give me a goddamn break!
Why the hell would I do that?

01:08:23.932 --> 01:08:26.734
You know the look in a woman's
eye when she's interested.

01:08:26.768 --> 01:08:30.205
Walk into casting
back then as the decider.

01:08:30.238 --> 01:08:33.142
There was a look
they gave.

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:35.477
I did not always look like this.

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:36.845
I never had to harass anybody

01:08:36.877 --> 01:08:39.481
and it's fucking offensive
to say that I did!

01:08:39.514 --> 01:08:41.450
Well, they're trying
to change history.

01:08:41.483 --> 01:08:44.687
For their families. Some of them probably
don't even remember what happened.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.823
That's gracious of you, Beth.

01:08:50.692 --> 01:08:52.761
But this is political.

01:08:52.794 --> 01:08:56.231
I defy you to find any evidence

01:08:56.264 --> 01:08:59.368
that a single part of what
these women are saying is true.

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:01.537
Get ready. More will come.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:04.305
We need to let Rupert know
what it means if I lose.

01:09:04.339 --> 01:09:07.442
Gretchen Carlson
could kill Fox News.

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:09.678
This is a fight for your jobs.

01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:11.479
If I go, you go!

01:09:14.482 --> 01:09:17.319
If you'd asked me what type of
sexual fetish Roger Ailes had,

01:09:17.352 --> 01:09:18.662
I never would have come up
with garter belts,

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:20.220
but it's fucking perfect.

01:09:20.255 --> 01:09:22.191
Their stories are so similar.

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.234
That doesn't prove much.

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:25.426
Sherman met them all
through Gretchen's lawyer.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.620
They could have been coached.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:29.497
The blowjob thing
feels real to me.

01:09:29.531 --> 01:09:31.667
Does Roger seem like a guy
who would get off

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.868
on that particular
power dynamic? Yes.

01:09:33.902 --> 01:09:35.470
A guy who maybe thinks

01:09:35.502 --> 01:09:37.906
oral doesn't
really count? Maybe.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:39.640
A guy who has reasons to prefer

01:09:39.674 --> 01:09:41.844
a sex act that lets him
keep his clothes on?

01:09:42.477 --> 01:09:43.912
Sure.

01:09:43.944 --> 01:09:45.281
Still doesn't make it true.

01:09:46.514 --> 01:09:47.849
Well, if true,

01:09:47.881 --> 01:09:50.818
these incidents all happened
before Fox started.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.654
- Should that matter?
- No.

01:09:53.688 --> 01:09:54.690
Yes.

01:10:01.596 --> 01:10:02.897
I talked to Gerson Zweifach.

01:10:03.598 --> 01:10:05.000
And?

01:10:05.033 --> 01:10:06.635
He asked me to encourage women

01:10:06.668 --> 01:10:08.135
who have claims to come forward.

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:11.473
You remember what happened
last time you got between Rupert and Roger?

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:15.811
Before I speak out,

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:18.681
I need to know if this happened
to other women at Fox.

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:21.984
You understand that?

01:10:24.452 --> 01:10:26.455
Is this one
where you really wanna know,

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:28.657
or you wanna look like

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:30.259
you really wanna know,
but don't?

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.495
I really wanna know.

01:10:36.898 --> 01:10:38.000
I'm not always like that.

01:10:39.734 --> 01:10:40.978
No one around here believes

01:10:41.002 --> 01:10:43.272
Roger would want
to harass Gretchen.

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:46.742
I will send you some of
her soapy notes to Roger.

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:49.010
"Last night
Sandra filled in for Megyn.

01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:50.979
"Why not me? Smiley face."

01:10:51.012 --> 01:10:54.416
Who sends a harasser
a smiley face?

01:10:54.449 --> 01:10:56.018
- Martin.
- Hey, Nancy.

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.853
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

01:10:58.486 --> 01:11:00.656
Hi, Nancy. Coffee?

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:02.258
Thank you.

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.761
So, what do you got?

01:11:07.462 --> 01:11:11.667
So, um, no one from Fox
has come forward.

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.035
No one?

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:14.336
Rudi Bakhtiar.

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:18.572
But no one who's still there?

01:11:18.606 --> 01:11:21.309
There's been nothing
but praise for Roger.

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:23.512
Except from Megyn Kelly.

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:24.680
She's been unusually silent.

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.548
Right. Well,
something must've happened

01:11:26.581 --> 01:11:28.483
to Megyn in the past with Roger.

01:11:28.516 --> 01:11:31.053
She's way too ambitious
not to support him.

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:32.421
Possibly.

01:11:33.388 --> 01:11:34.790
Should you call?

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:37.826
Tell her this is a spotlight
you'd be happy to share?

01:11:37.859 --> 01:11:39.828
Megyn, share?

01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:41.797
No. She wouldn't do it.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.607
- What makes you say that?
- Because I wouldn't.

01:11:43.631 --> 01:11:46.668
I mean, Roger plays his women
off against each other.

01:11:46.701 --> 01:11:47.969
He's always done it.
He'll say,

01:11:48.002 --> 01:11:49.938
"Megyn thinks that
Lisa should get your spot."

01:11:49.971 --> 01:11:52.441
Or, "Megyn suspects
that you're screwing Cal."

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:54.085
And then he'll offer advice
on how to get back at her,

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.310
as if you brought it up.

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:57.913
- She's renegotiating her deal.
- I can think of roughly

01:11:57.946 --> 01:12:00.615
15 million reasons
to stay quiet.

01:12:00.648 --> 01:12:02.684
We do need some collaboration.

01:12:02.717 --> 01:12:03.894
Well,
that would certainly help

01:12:03.918 --> 01:12:05.587
with the other networks.

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.456
Oh, God. What?

01:12:08.523 --> 01:12:09.558
What, Marty?

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:11.927
Well, we've not had, um,

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.730
a lot of incoming
job interests from them.

01:12:16.431 --> 01:12:17.598
What's not a lot?

01:12:19.901 --> 01:12:20.903
None.

01:12:21.736 --> 01:12:23.339
They're afraid of Roger.

01:12:24.172 --> 01:12:25.973
No.

01:12:26.007 --> 01:12:28.110
No woman gets to sue her boss.

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:30.078
Rule number one
of corporate America,

01:12:30.111 --> 01:12:31.547
you don't sue your boss.

01:12:33.715 --> 01:12:36.051
I jumped off a cliff.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.857
I thought one of them
would stand with me.

01:12:46.127 --> 01:12:47.763
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, we're home.

01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:50.031
God, uh... Hey, honey.

01:12:50.064 --> 01:12:51.933
There's a snack in the kitchen.

01:12:51.966 --> 01:12:53.135
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:12:58.473 --> 01:12:59.541
We're gonna get him.

01:13:02.043 --> 01:13:03.911
Megyn doesn't want
to release a statement.

01:13:03.945 --> 01:13:06.148
It could be seen as
influencing the investigation.

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:08.983
Have her say that
to Roger's face.

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:12.621
Look, let us know who else
hasn't spoken up for him,

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:16.024
and maybe she can
encourage them, privately.

01:13:16.057 --> 01:13:19.094
No! Jesus. We need
our anchors. We need her.

01:13:19.861 --> 01:13:21.530
Let me talk to her.

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:23.131
Yes, please.

01:13:23.164 --> 01:13:28.135
Look, sweetheart. This is
an island of safety and truth.

01:13:28.169 --> 01:13:29.905
I wear pants.

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:32.174
No one has ever told me
not to wear pants.

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:35.076
I wear pants. I'd love to know
where that came from.

01:13:35.109 --> 01:13:36.645
It's obnoxious. It's toxic.

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:39.748
We need everyone on Team Roger.

01:13:39.781 --> 01:13:41.550
Everyone.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.085
- Hi.
- Good morning.

01:13:44.786 --> 01:13:49.191
Come on. No one
makes me wear short skirts.

01:13:53.027 --> 01:13:54.830
He was the first
to put a female on

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:56.598
as host of a prime-time show.

01:13:56.631 --> 01:13:58.667
Roger Ailes champions women.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.570
No. There is no leg cam.

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:04.539
No. Could you just
hold on for one sec?

01:14:04.572 --> 01:14:06.608
Maggie? I have to
wear pants tomorrow.

01:14:06.641 --> 01:14:09.177
Not without authorization from
the second floor, you don't.

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:10.955
We never fitted her for pants!

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:12.189
You can print
whatever story you like,

01:14:12.213 --> 01:14:13.248
but there is no leg cam.

01:14:13.281 --> 01:14:14.649
- Lily?
- Hmm?

01:14:14.682 --> 01:14:16.617
Beth needs me to talk to Megyn.

01:14:16.651 --> 01:14:18.019
I'm gonna do an on-air statement

01:14:18.052 --> 01:14:19.163
while all the Fox women come out

01:14:19.187 --> 01:14:20.789
one by one behind me for Roger.

01:14:20.822 --> 01:14:22.491
That will never happen.

01:14:23.958 --> 01:14:24.992
Ains?

01:14:31.933 --> 01:14:34.836
Well, you know why Roger's got
that door blocking his office?

01:14:34.869 --> 01:14:37.138
Well, yeah, 'cause
a Bangladeshi from Accounting

01:14:37.171 --> 01:14:38.840
wandered in one day by mistake.

01:14:38.873 --> 01:14:40.208
Please.

01:14:40.241 --> 01:14:41.176
It's so girls can come in

01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:42.889
from the back elevator
and no one sees 'em.

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:45.481
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:47.883
We get talent
coming here all the time

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.651
looking to get their faces done.

01:14:49.684 --> 01:14:52.020
"I'm going to see Roger.
I gotta look my best."

01:14:52.053 --> 01:14:53.088
Yeah. One came back out

01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:55.524
with it rubbed off her nose
and chin.

01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:57.993
Who was that?

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:04.232
My memory's horrible.

01:15:04.265 --> 01:15:06.268
You should go see Janice
in Weather.

01:15:08.803 --> 01:15:11.039
I mean, nobody wants to talk.

01:15:11.072 --> 01:15:12.457
Can you blame them?

01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:13.842
No.

01:15:13.875 --> 01:15:15.244
Where'd you disappear to?

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:18.647
I've got names.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.116
Women rumored
to have stories about Roger.

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.751
- From who?
- Janice.

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:24.202
Weather Janice?

01:15:24.203 --> 01:15:25.620
Everybody confides in her.

01:15:25.653 --> 01:15:27.222
Nobody from Weather
wants your job.

01:15:27.255 --> 01:15:28.299
What are you going
to do with them?

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.824
Tell them this time's different.

01:15:29.857 --> 01:15:30.968
- Wait.
- No, don't wait.

01:15:30.992 --> 01:15:31.893
Don't listen to him.

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:34.629
Listen... Look, it's not only
your job here.

01:15:34.662 --> 01:15:37.666
I got kids, okay?
Lily has a baby now.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:40.268
Julia'll lose her visa
and have to go back to Canada.

01:15:40.301 --> 01:15:44.039
And we know that you've been
talking to broadcast networks.

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:47.642
Yeah, you can get a job
anywhere. But we can't.

01:15:47.675 --> 01:15:50.078
And no offense,
but who the hell will you be?

01:15:51.145 --> 01:15:54.316
Nobody leaves Fox, Megyn.
Not really.

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:56.851
It's in your DNA now.

01:15:56.884 --> 01:16:00.255
So, think about
what you're blowing up here.

01:16:00.288 --> 01:16:02.057
I say find the truth.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:12.800
Well, that face
tells me nothing.

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:15.202
Well, if they come after you,

01:16:15.236 --> 01:16:17.706
it won't be you they come after.

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:27.191
<i>Gretchen Carlson,</i>

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:28.717
<i>your old colleague at Fox News,</i>

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:29.893
<i>has issued some allegations,</i>

01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:31.620
<i>some sexual-harassment
allegations</i>

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:33.154
<i>over your boss, Roger Ailes.</i>

01:16:33.187 --> 01:16:34.656
<i>What is your position on this?</i>

01:16:34.689 --> 01:16:35.966
<i>What did you think
when you heard this?</i>

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:38.059
<i> In this country,
every famous,</i>

01:16:38.092 --> 01:16:40.929
<i>powerful or wealthy person
is a target.</i>

01:16:40.962 --> 01:16:42.664
<i>You're a target. I'm a target.</i>

01:16:42.697 --> 01:16:45.700
<i>Any time,
somebody could come out</i>

01:16:45.733 --> 01:16:47.302
<i>and sue us, attack us,</i>

01:16:47.335 --> 01:16:48.903
<i>go to the press

01:16:48.936 --> 01:16:50.739
<i>And that's
a deplorable situation.</i>

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.941
<i>I've worked for Roger Ailes
for 20 years.</i>

01:16:52.974 --> 01:16:54.676
<i>Best boss I've ever had.</i>

01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:56.778
Well, I've never been told
what I can't wear.

01:16:57.712 --> 01:16:59.080
Well, I know you didn't ask,

01:16:59.113 --> 01:17:00.782
but I think it needs to be said.

01:17:02.984 --> 01:17:05.086
It's a very confusing time
right now.

01:17:05.119 --> 01:17:06.855
Tonight is Manhattanhenge.

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:09.391
Sunset will align perfectly
with the city's grid.

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:13.261
The best viewing streets
are 14th, 34th and 57th.

01:17:13.294 --> 01:17:15.139
- Good day, New York.
- And clear.

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:16.206
See you tomorrow,
Jimmy.

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:17.464
Yep. Have a good one.

01:17:17.498 --> 01:17:21.135
A babe with no geezer?
This can't be a Fox affiliate.

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:22.704
Megyn. My God. How are you?

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:25.840
Good. How about you?

01:17:25.873 --> 01:17:27.741
Good. How's your mom?

01:17:27.775 --> 01:17:30.178
She's good. She's training
to be a security guard.

01:17:30.211 --> 01:17:32.347
Is that because of
the Trump stuff, or is that...

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:35.083
No. She just wants a job
where she gets to carry a gun.

01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:43.825
So, did you come up here
to talk about Roger?

01:17:43.858 --> 01:17:45.760
What would make you
say that?

01:17:45.793 --> 01:17:47.195
I've been at local
for two years,

01:17:47.228 --> 01:17:48.764
nobody's ever come to see me.

01:17:49.797 --> 01:17:50.898
You miss us?

01:17:52.166 --> 01:17:54.269
The network I worked at
for 14 years?

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:57.339
That my dad helped build?
Where my brother's a reporter?

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.409
Juliet, did Roger ever...

01:18:01.442 --> 01:18:03.378
No.

01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:05.847
I heard things,
but nothing firsthand.

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:07.416
Good.

01:18:08.516 --> 01:18:10.317
- I miss you.
- I miss you more.

01:18:10.351 --> 01:18:11.602
We should go have a drink.

01:18:11.603 --> 01:18:12.853
Yes.

01:18:13.821 --> 01:18:15.724
Um...

01:18:22.797 --> 01:18:23.799
Roger...

01:18:26.434 --> 01:18:30.905
He has detectives on staff.

01:18:30.938 --> 01:18:32.307
Up on 14.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:36.044
They look into enemies,
follow them,

01:18:36.077 --> 01:18:37.912
post negative stories online.

01:18:37.945 --> 01:18:39.280
It's called the Black Room.

01:18:39.313 --> 01:18:40.849
I don't want you
in danger, all right?

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:43.050
No, no, no.
I'm not talking about me.

01:18:45.052 --> 01:18:46.353
I'm talking about you.

01:18:48.422 --> 01:18:51.392
Be careful who you ask
questions about Roger Ailes.

01:18:57.398 --> 01:18:59.501
My lawyers
are negotiating with Fox.

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:04.306
Not that Bill will pay
any of it.

01:19:04.939 --> 01:19:06.040
Bill?

01:19:06.073 --> 01:19:07.242
O'Reilly.

01:19:08.576 --> 01:19:09.978
And Jack.

01:19:12.246 --> 01:19:13.882
Jesus.

01:19:15.483 --> 01:19:16.485
Sorry.

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:20.522
Fish rots from the head.

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:27.471
I'm gonna talk
to the outside firm

01:19:27.495 --> 01:19:29.498
investigating this, Paul/Weiss.

01:19:30.898 --> 01:19:33.401
I heard you had
some issues over here.

01:19:33.434 --> 01:19:34.936
I did.

01:19:34.969 --> 01:19:36.438
If you have a name to give.

01:19:37.905 --> 01:19:39.840
Roger.

01:19:39.874 --> 01:19:41.943
I wouldn't ask
if I didn't think it was safe.

01:19:48.115 --> 01:19:49.050
Roger.

01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:52.187
<i>Jack. Roger. Roger.</i>

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.888
<i>Doug. Roger. Jack.</i>

01:19:53.921 --> 01:19:55.523
<i>Roger. Francisco. Doug.
Bill. Jack.</i>

01:19:55.556 --> 01:19:57.959
<i>Jack. Francisco. Bill.
Roger. Roger.</i>

01:20:03.264 --> 01:20:04.900
It's Kayla, right?

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:06.434
Yeah.

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:09.070
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:09.537 --> 01:20:10.605
Megyn.

01:20:10.638 --> 01:20:12.140
I know.

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:16.077
You used to work
with Gretchen, right?

01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:17.312
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:18.580
Did you learn a lot from her?

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:20.448
I did, yes.

01:20:20.481 --> 01:20:23.218
I have nothing but
good things to say about her.

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:25.253
That's great.

01:20:25.286 --> 01:20:27.188
You know, I always find it
so interesting

01:20:27.221 --> 01:20:28.322
who history chooses

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:30.425
- to do something important.
- Mmm.

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.262
I guess.

01:20:34.295 --> 01:20:36.031
Listen, I wanted to ask you...

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.137
I wanted to ask you
if Roger is harassing you.

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:51.880
How did you know?

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:57.018
We find each other.

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:01.389
You, too?

01:21:02.523 --> 01:21:03.925
Long time ago.

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:08.930
Wow.

01:21:16.971 --> 01:21:18.138
You okay?

01:21:19.273 --> 01:21:20.408
Mmm-hmm.

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:28.148
You should report Roger.

01:21:29.083 --> 01:21:30.317
You'll be protected.

01:21:30.952 --> 01:21:31.953
Did you?

01:21:32.687 --> 01:21:34.389
I took it to his superior.

01:21:37.258 --> 01:21:40.228
Nothing happened.
I had to drop it.

01:21:40.261 --> 01:21:41.263
Why?

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.367
I wanted to be on television.

01:21:48.035 --> 01:21:50.038
Did you think
what your silence would mean?

01:21:51.238 --> 01:21:54.242
For us? The rest of us?

01:21:54.275 --> 01:21:56.510
Roger is not my fault.

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:59.714
It would've been nice if...

01:21:59.747 --> 01:22:03.952
If somebody told us that
he's after more than legs.

01:22:05.486 --> 01:22:08.089
It's nobody's job
to protect you, Kayla.

01:22:08.122 --> 01:22:09.958
That's all of our job.

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:14.295
I don't get you. You're...

01:22:14.328 --> 01:22:15.964
You have power.

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:18.099
Why are you still playing
by old rules?

01:22:18.132 --> 01:22:19.534
You're Megyn Kelly.

01:22:20.401 --> 01:22:22.202
Look around, snowflake.

01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:25.106
How do you think I succeeded?

01:22:25.139 --> 01:22:27.976
How do you think a woman
gets a prime-time Fox show?

01:22:31.345 --> 01:22:33.348
So, you had sex with him?

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:35.417
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:22:41.088 --> 01:22:42.265
<i>One thing to keep in mind</i>

01:22:42.289 --> 01:22:44.992
<i>about the prospect of Indiana
governor, Mike Pence,</i>

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:47.061
<i>becoming Donald Trump's
running mate...</i>

01:22:53.167 --> 01:22:54.169
Hello.

01:22:55.302 --> 01:22:57.071
Hey, it's me.

01:22:57.104 --> 01:23:00.408
Oh, my God.
What the fuck? Kayla.

01:23:00.441 --> 01:23:03.510
<i>It said "Bill" in my phone.
What the fuck?</i>

01:23:03.544 --> 01:23:07.181
Oh, sorry. I saved my number
under his name

01:23:07.214 --> 01:23:09.450
in your phone, um, as a joke.

01:23:09.483 --> 01:23:10.868
<i>I forgot.</i>

01:23:10.869 --> 01:23:12.253
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

01:23:12.286 --> 01:23:14.155
I had a heart attack.

01:23:14.188 --> 01:23:17.091
<i> Where are you?</i>

01:23:17.124 --> 01:23:18.226
Um...

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:19.511
I'm on a date.

01:23:19.512 --> 01:23:20.762
<i>Oh.</i>

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:23.264
Okay.

01:23:23.297 --> 01:23:24.299
<i>Hey. Did you, um...</i>

01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:30.038
Did you give my name
to Megyn by any chance?

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:34.308
I... I may have, um,

01:23:34.341 --> 01:23:38.079
worried about you out loud
once or twice.

01:23:38.112 --> 01:23:39.381
Why didn't you just

01:23:40.748 --> 01:23:41.782
support me?

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:43.550
<i>I don't... I don't even know.</i>

01:23:43.584 --> 01:23:47.022
I couldn't
do anything. And I...

01:23:48.522 --> 01:23:52.494
I can't fuck up because
I'm a lesbian at Fox News.

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.329
So?

01:23:55.362 --> 01:23:59.634
So, who's your date with, Kayla?

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.669
<i>I can't just go
on a date with a dude</i>

01:24:01.702 --> 01:24:04.672
<i>and make it go away, you know?</i>

01:24:13.447 --> 01:24:15.083
I think I'm...

01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:18.520
I think I'm gonna
call Paul/Weiss.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.223
Okay. That's good.

01:24:22.256 --> 01:24:23.357
<i>That's really good.</i>

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:25.692
<i> I'm really glad
you're doing that.</i>

01:24:25.726 --> 01:24:28.663
<i>I think that's absolutely
what you should do.</i>

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:29.831
Okay, great.

01:24:31.165 --> 01:24:33.301
<i>I just, um... I just...</i>

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:35.202
I didn't...

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:37.138
I can't call anyone else
and I just...

01:24:37.171 --> 01:24:39.240
I need someone right now

01:24:39.273 --> 01:24:42.410
to tell me
that that's what I should do.

01:24:42.443 --> 01:24:43.578
<i>Oh, my God, yes.</i>

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:45.213
I heard it was, like,
an outside firm

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:47.182
and they're taking it
really seriously.

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:50.385
Okay, great. Thanks.

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:54.688
Kayla.

01:24:56.657 --> 01:24:58.259
<i>What happened?</i>

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:02.630
I did it.

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:05.266
I...

01:25:06.433 --> 01:25:08.436
I did it. I gave in to him.

01:25:12.606 --> 01:25:14.142
<i>Kayla, I...</i>

01:25:15.809 --> 01:25:17.345
I'm so sorry.

01:25:18.846 --> 01:25:21.382
He kept talking.
He just kept talking.

01:25:21.415 --> 01:25:22.784
He kept saying...

01:25:24.218 --> 01:25:26.220
"Good girl.

01:25:26.253 --> 01:25:28.423
"That's a good girl.
Be a good soldier.

01:25:31.258 --> 01:25:32.827
"Earn your place."

01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:34.327
Fuck.

01:25:34.361 --> 01:25:36.631
<i>He didn't even...</i>

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:37.898
Didn't even unbuckle.

01:25:38.899 --> 01:25:40.768
He couldn't get...

01:25:51.645 --> 01:25:53.714
I feel so filthy.

01:25:53.747 --> 01:25:55.483
<i>No, Kayla.</i>

01:25:55.516 --> 01:25:57.552
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:26:00.721 --> 01:26:01.889
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:26:05.559 --> 01:26:06.828
I better go.

01:26:08.929 --> 01:26:11.699
Roger can sense
vulnerabilities.

01:26:11.732 --> 01:26:15.202
In those days, our meetings
were career-strategy sessions

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:18.773
mixed with good advice
and comments like...

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:22.442
The most basic thing
is confidence.

01:26:22.476 --> 01:26:24.712
Feel at home in your own skin.

01:26:24.745 --> 01:26:27.248
If you're confident,
you're sexy.

01:26:27.281 --> 01:26:29.617
I'm sure you have
some sexy bras.

01:26:29.650 --> 01:26:32.452
I'd love to see you in those.

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:36.991
It was a cat-and-mouse game.

01:26:37.024 --> 01:26:39.360
But he always gave me
good advice,

01:26:39.393 --> 01:26:40.695
and let me deflect,

01:26:42.663 --> 01:26:44.199
tell him to dream on.

01:26:46.567 --> 01:26:48.436
The more I let him
get away with,

01:26:50.604 --> 01:26:52.807
the more he pushed my buttons.

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:56.477
<i> I don't know if women
can be good interviewers.</i>

01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:59.714
Men have that killer instinct.

01:27:00.981 --> 01:27:02.183
We do bad things.

01:27:03.417 --> 01:27:05.353
And we do not
feel guilty about it.

01:27:07.688 --> 01:27:11.492
How can I be sure
you have that kind of drive?

01:27:15.829 --> 01:27:17.732
Finally, in January...

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:18.933
This is '06?

01:27:18.966 --> 01:27:20.235
Yes.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.528
He grabbed me.

01:27:49.997 --> 01:27:51.432
Tried to kiss me.

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:01.776
I pushed him away twice.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:10.752
<i>As I was leaving, he asked,
"When's your contract up?"</i>

01:28:27.801 --> 01:28:29.837
After the third time, I left.

01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:32.807
And he never tried
anything again?

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.042
No.

01:28:35.142 --> 01:28:37.612
I ignored his calls.
Stayed in DC.

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:39.847
Two years later, I had a show.

01:28:41.081 --> 01:28:44.118
Any long-term consequences?

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:49.624
Yeah. Um...

01:28:57.998 --> 01:29:00.134
Am I Witness W?

01:29:00.167 --> 01:29:02.537
Yes. Why?

01:29:03.637 --> 01:29:05.606
It's the 23rd letter
in the alphabet.

01:29:06.673 --> 01:29:08.442
Have 22 other women come forward

01:29:08.475 --> 01:29:10.011
since I first spoke to you?

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:12.780
Have they?

01:29:17.050 --> 01:29:18.419
Will there be more?

01:29:28.128 --> 01:29:29.964
<i> A major bombshell
this morning.</i>

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:32.867
<i>Star anchor Megyn Kelly
has informed lawyers</i>

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:34.768
<i>that Fox News CEO, Roger Ailes,</i>

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:36.504
<i>sexually harassed her.</i>

01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:37.881
<i>For her to level
these allegations</i>

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:39.407
<i>is devastating against Ailes.</i>

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.776
<i>We are seeing
the end of an era at Fox News.</i>

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:43.611
<i>The dagger in his heart,
in some ways,</i>

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:45.179
<i>was the notion that Megyn Kelly</i>

01:29:45.212 --> 01:29:47.181
<i>was among his accusers.</i>

01:29:47.214 --> 01:29:48.883
What?

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:51.452
What?

01:29:51.485 --> 01:29:53.121
Yes. Yes.

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:04.765
Roger, what's the matter?

01:30:04.798 --> 01:30:06.042
Megyn's claiming I harassed her.

01:30:06.066 --> 01:30:07.768
- What?
- You saw Gabe Sherman's post?

01:30:07.801 --> 01:30:09.804
James has been
feeding him bullshit.

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:10.948
Comb through Megyn's press.

01:30:10.972 --> 01:30:13.641
Find every single positive
thing she's said about me

01:30:13.674 --> 01:30:14.975
and get it out, now.

01:30:15.008 --> 01:30:18.446
Roger, I can't discredit
an anchor I'm paid to promote.

01:30:20.614 --> 01:30:23.017
Glad I'm not in a foxhole
with you.

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:26.053
Well, we'll leak something
to Breitbart or to Drudge.

01:30:26.086 --> 01:30:27.455
I'm sorry, Roger.

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:29.123
Well, do something!

01:30:29.156 --> 01:30:31.559
At least get some shit
about Gretchen out there.

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:33.494
These women
are trying to fuck me!

01:30:37.664 --> 01:30:39.642
I have no answers for you
that you don't already know.

01:30:39.666 --> 01:30:41.101
It's out of my hands
at this point.

01:30:41.134 --> 01:30:43.804
We will be emailing you guys.
Please just hold tight.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.642
Thanks.

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.210
Hey, Gil.

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:50.578
Hey, Greta.

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.713
What's Megyn's endgame?

01:30:52.746 --> 01:30:54.915
This part of her
contract negotiation?

01:30:54.948 --> 01:30:56.584
It's not economic.

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.052
Or political.

01:30:58.085 --> 01:30:59.086
Okay, Gil.

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:04.657
No, this is scaring me.

01:31:04.691 --> 01:31:05.969
It's like
the whole world's on fire

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:07.904
- and no one can be trusted.
- Hey, Geraldo.

01:31:07.928 --> 01:31:09.797
- CNN, line six.
- Can't talk.

01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:11.532
These are the end-times.

01:31:11.565 --> 01:31:12.609
Why aren't you on the phone?

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:14.101
To comment on sexual harassment?

01:31:14.134 --> 01:31:15.803
We work for Bill.

01:31:15.836 --> 01:31:16.971
Team Roger.

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:18.572
Hey, we need you to wear it.

01:31:18.605 --> 01:31:19.772
- No.
- Are you kidding?

01:31:19.806 --> 01:31:20.941
- No.
- Are you kidding?

01:31:20.974 --> 01:31:22.218
- Doesn't she have a job?
- Get it on.

01:31:22.242 --> 01:31:23.711
Megyn Kelly has no comment.

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:24.879
She's traveling.

01:31:25.812 --> 01:31:27.047
To Cleveland.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.683
For the Republican convention,
remember?

01:31:29.716 --> 01:31:31.585
Look, I've known him
for 40 years,

01:31:31.618 --> 01:31:33.988
and he's about as flirty as
the grizzly from <i> The Revenant.</i>

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.132
Let me
tell you something.

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:37.992
I called these allegations
sick 'cause they are sick.

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:40.561
Hey, why wasn't I let in
on the pact?

01:31:40.594 --> 01:31:41.629
What pact?

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:43.097
Breitbart is saying
there's a pact

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:45.099
among our top 50 on-air talents

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:46.543
that if Roger gets fired,
we all walk.

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:47.701
Great. Where do I sign?

01:31:47.734 --> 01:31:48.969
Wait, I never heard of a pact.

01:31:49.002 --> 01:31:50.004
Me either.

01:31:52.639 --> 01:31:53.808
Roger placed it.

01:31:55.275 --> 01:31:56.777
Fake news.

01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:57.845
Come on.

01:31:57.878 --> 01:31:59.780
<i> How bad
does it look for Roger?</i>

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:02.216
<i> Bad.</i>

01:32:02.249 --> 01:32:05.219
Doesn't feel
like I imagined it would.

01:32:05.252 --> 01:32:08.256
<i>Gretchen, you achieved
something remarkable.</i>

01:32:10.257 --> 01:32:11.826
Yes, I did.

01:32:14.261 --> 01:32:15.296
Mom?

01:32:16.730 --> 01:32:19.066
I think it's time
we finish this.

01:32:19.099 --> 01:32:21.002
<i>Okay. I'll let you know.</i>

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:25.940
Mom, are you done with that?

01:32:26.974 --> 01:32:28.576
Mmm-hmm. I'm done.

01:32:30.844 --> 01:32:32.146
I made the Murdochs

01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:34.882
1.5 billion in profit
last year.

01:32:34.915 --> 01:32:35.950
Pure profit.

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:37.918
Fox News is the most successful

01:32:37.951 --> 01:32:39.403
cable franchise in history.

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:43.590
Gretchen Carlson's lawyers.

01:32:45.058 --> 01:32:47.361
She wants to settle.

01:32:47.394 --> 01:32:49.863
It's a lot less appealing
to sue you personally

01:32:49.896 --> 01:32:51.831
without Rupert's money
behind you.

01:32:55.869 --> 01:32:56.871
Hey, Ken.

01:33:00.273 --> 01:33:01.275
Ken.

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:28.835
Hey! Look who's here.

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:30.269
Oh, my gosh!

01:33:30.303 --> 01:33:32.673
- I brought you some small people.
- Yard! Yatesy!

01:33:32.706 --> 01:33:34.217
Oh, my gosh.
I've missed you guys so much.

01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:36.076
We practiced that scare
for two weeks.

01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:37.277
Look at you.

01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:38.912
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:33:38.945 --> 01:33:40.547
I love you, Mama.

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:42.148
My little chubble-wubbles.

01:33:42.182 --> 01:33:43.183
We got her.

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:44.184
All right.

01:33:44.217 --> 01:33:46.085
She was so scared.

01:33:46.119 --> 01:33:47.420
Thank you.

01:33:47.454 --> 01:33:49.423
How are you, sweetheart?

01:33:49.456 --> 01:33:51.325
I'm either damned for doing it

01:33:51.358 --> 01:33:52.760
or damned
for not doing it sooner.

01:33:54.995 --> 01:33:57.298
Tell me my big mouth
didn't ruin our life.

01:33:58.098 --> 01:33:59.100
Not yet.

01:34:05.872 --> 01:34:08.042
Can I speak
to Roger alone, please?

01:34:16.717 --> 01:34:18.237
Are you sure
you want Beth here?

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:20.655
Well, of course.

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:29.430
Gretchen taped
your conversations.

01:34:31.231 --> 01:34:32.766
That's a goddamn lie.

01:34:32.799 --> 01:34:34.101
For over a year.

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:38.372
But...

01:34:39.272 --> 01:34:40.974
you don't believe her?

01:34:41.007 --> 01:34:43.977
Your quotes in her lawsuit,
they're from tapes.

01:34:48.048 --> 01:34:49.782
Why didn't they tell us before?

01:34:49.816 --> 01:34:51.852
So you'd issue complete denials.

01:34:53.987 --> 01:34:55.723
So you'd have no credibility.

01:35:02.362 --> 01:35:04.298
Apparently,
she did her homework.

01:35:21.348 --> 01:35:24.284
<i> God bless our
next President, Donald Trump,</i>

01:35:24.317 --> 01:35:28.489
<i>and God bless
the United States of America!</i>

01:35:29.456 --> 01:35:31.125
<i>USA!</i>

01:35:32.092 --> 01:35:34.193
Mr. Giuliani's fired up.

01:35:34.227 --> 01:35:36.230
When we come back,
we'll discuss his speech

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:38.232
with the man
who helped write it.

01:35:38.265 --> 01:35:39.767
Clear.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.401
<i>Don't react, okay?</i>

01:35:41.434 --> 01:35:42.469
Mmm-hmm.

01:35:42.502 --> 01:35:43.838
<i>Roger's out.</i>

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:48.542
Is that sourced, Gil?

01:35:48.575 --> 01:35:50.544
<i>Yeah. The</i> New York Post.

01:35:50.577 --> 01:35:52.412
<i>They put him on the cover.</i>

01:35:52.445 --> 01:35:54.148
<i>Rupert's telling him to let go.</i>

01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:56.282
Then it's a scoop.

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:58.318
<i> We're gonna win.
We're gonna win so big.</i>

01:35:58.351 --> 01:36:00.187
<i>Thank you very much, everybody.</i>

01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.531
There is some
breaking news tonight

01:36:01.555 --> 01:36:03.257
in the worlds of
media and politics.

01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:05.058
A blockbuster shakeup
at Fox News.

01:36:05.091 --> 01:36:06.493
A dramatic fall from grace.

01:36:06.526 --> 01:36:09.496
Roger Ailes is out as top boss.

01:36:09.529 --> 01:36:11.231
They want us
to circle the block.

01:36:11.264 --> 01:36:12.466
No. Hold on.

01:36:15.969 --> 01:36:17.838
- What's going on?
- Go around.

01:36:20.907 --> 01:36:22.827
I've been shut out.

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:31.785
<i> It's true.</i>

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:34.254
Everything Gretchen said,
it's all true.

01:36:34.287 --> 01:36:35.389
Roger lied to me.

01:36:35.422 --> 01:36:37.924
Why?
Because I'm a manager here,

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:40.093
so I have concerns
my public defense of Roger

01:36:40.126 --> 01:36:41.895
could be construed as coercive.

01:36:41.928 --> 01:36:43.998
Hey. Huh. Pants.

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:45.533
Fuck off, Neil.

01:36:59.212 --> 01:37:00.547
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.216
No, no, no, no, no, sit down.

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:04.485
Appreciate you
driving up here, Roger.

01:37:05.418 --> 01:37:07.254
- Susan Estrich.
- Susan.

01:37:10.290 --> 01:37:12.626
I hate that it's come to this.

01:37:12.659 --> 01:37:14.161
Me, too.

01:37:24.571 --> 01:37:28.508
We gave these women jobs.

01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:31.478
Put them on the air,
made them famous.

01:37:31.511 --> 01:37:33.380
Do you think
for a goddamn second

01:37:33.413 --> 01:37:35.849
I did any damage to any of them?

01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:38.385
No, you don't.

01:37:41.054 --> 01:37:42.256
You don't, Rupert.

01:37:44.291 --> 01:37:47.161
There's no audience
for that side of the story.

01:37:57.671 --> 01:37:58.806
To begin with,

01:37:58.839 --> 01:38:01.608
half this, you already owe him
from last year's bonus.

01:38:01.641 --> 01:38:03.477
And we're paying it.

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.212
And paying off your contract.

01:38:05.245 --> 01:38:06.480
Consider yourself lucky.

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:09.917
It's a contractual obligation.

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:14.087
I created the Murdoch family's
most profitable asset.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.490
A third of your margin.

01:38:16.523 --> 01:38:18.625
There are three of you.

01:38:18.658 --> 01:38:20.494
I guess that means
I pay for the food

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:22.329
that one of you puts
in your mouth.

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:25.165
What if it's you?

01:38:25.198 --> 01:38:26.934
I'd have fired you for cause.

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:28.302
Roger,

01:38:28.335 --> 01:38:30.971
you built an amazing business.

01:38:31.004 --> 01:38:32.907
No one can take that
away from you.

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:36.677
But under the circumstances,

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:40.514
this is a lot of money.

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:42.182
And it won't look good
to the people

01:38:42.215 --> 01:38:43.650
that don't know your worth.

01:38:43.683 --> 01:38:45.352
Take it.

01:38:45.385 --> 01:38:47.254
Honor your non-compete.

01:38:54.661 --> 01:38:56.463
I never cared about the money.

01:38:57.597 --> 01:38:59.066
We know, Roger.

01:39:06.272 --> 01:39:07.308
Okay.

01:39:09.142 --> 01:39:12.012
Okay.

01:39:12.045 --> 01:39:14.514
I'd like to go
to the newsroom with you.

01:39:14.547 --> 01:39:17.384
I'd like us to announce
my leaving together.

01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:24.391
No.

01:39:36.436 --> 01:39:39.005
The end of the leg man.

01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:42.343
I won't miss him.

01:39:43.243 --> 01:39:44.278
Boys.

01:39:53.319 --> 01:39:55.322
Hope you two know
what you're doing.

01:39:59.759 --> 01:40:03.430
Once Roger's office is cleared
of handguns, I'll move in.

01:40:03.463 --> 01:40:06.099
I'll run the network
till the ship's aright.

01:40:09.502 --> 01:40:11.571
Donald.

01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:13.607
How's our speech coming?

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.542
Yeah.

01:40:17.677 --> 01:40:20.514
<i>Megyn's gotta go! Ho, ho, ho!</i>

01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:24.817
<i>Megyn's gotta go! Ho, ho, ho!</i>

01:40:24.851 --> 01:40:26.328
Convention's
downstairs, folks.

01:40:26.352 --> 01:40:27.430
What's going on at Fox?

01:40:27.454 --> 01:40:28.322
Would you say
people are shocked?

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:30.123
Can Rupert
afford to dump Roger?

01:40:30.156 --> 01:40:32.125
What did he do to you?
Megyn. Come on!

01:40:32.158 --> 01:40:33.794
<i> Of all the ways
this could end,</i>

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:35.162
<i>I didn't see this one coming.</i>

01:40:36.496 --> 01:40:38.198
<i>Gretchen Carlson
got the Murdochs</i>

01:40:38.231 --> 01:40:40.067
<i>to put the rights of women
above profit,</i>

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.736
<i>if only temporarily.</i>

01:40:42.769 --> 01:40:45.705
<i>And I found myself
with a job I didn't want</i>

01:40:45.738 --> 01:40:47.608
<i>or couldn't really leave</i>

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:50.177
<i>even when I did.</i>

01:40:58.351 --> 01:41:00.387
You should keep that out.

01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.355
People, can I get
your attention, please?

01:41:02.388 --> 01:41:04.491
Mr. Murdoch
is joining us today.

01:41:04.524 --> 01:41:06.524
He has a very important
statement he'd like to say.

01:41:07.894 --> 01:41:09.763
Excuse me, everyone.

01:41:09.796 --> 01:41:11.698
I won't take long.

01:41:11.731 --> 01:41:13.266
Roger Ailes is leaving Fox.

01:41:14.834 --> 01:41:17.637
Now, I want to start
by thanking Roger

01:41:17.670 --> 01:41:20.140
for his remarkable contribution

01:41:20.173 --> 01:41:22.709
to our company
and to our country.

01:41:22.742 --> 01:41:25.679
Twenty years ago,
Roger shared...

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:26.856
<i> Here's the thing about</i>

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.117
<i>being sexually harassed at work.</i>

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:31.585
<i>It condemns you to questions.</i>

01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.656
<i>You keep asking yourself,</i>

01:41:36.689 --> 01:41:38.158
<i>"What did I do?</i>

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:40.127
<i>"What did I say?</i>

01:41:40.793 --> 01:41:42.529
<i>"What did I wear?</i>

01:41:42.562 --> 01:41:43.730
<i>"What did I miss?</i>

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:46.400
<i>"Am I seen as weak?</i>

01:41:49.169 --> 01:41:51.105
<i>"Will they say I'm after money?</i>

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:55.175
<i>"Will they say
I'm after attention?</i>

01:41:57.477 --> 01:41:58.812
<i>"Will I be left out?</i>

01:42:01.681 --> 01:42:04.851
<i>"Will I be defined by this
for the rest of my life?"</i>

01:42:04.884 --> 01:42:08.455
I will take over
as Chairman and acting CEO

01:42:08.488 --> 01:42:11.591
with the support of our
existing management team,

01:42:11.624 --> 01:42:13.427
under Bill Shine.

01:42:15.328 --> 01:42:18.298
<i> If I stay, do I just
have to put up with it?</i>

01:42:25.538 --> 01:42:27.406
<i>Will the next place
be different?</i>

01:42:29.976 --> 01:42:32.246
<i>Or can I make it different?</i>

01:42:45.458 --> 01:42:46.469
<i> Roger always said,</i>

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:49.363
<i>"Everyone on television
only has one real job.</i>

01:42:50.496 --> 01:42:51.765
<i>"To be likable."</i>

01:42:53.266 --> 01:42:55.468
<i>Well, I don't care
if you like me,</i>

01:42:55.501 --> 01:42:57.271
<i>only that you believe me.</i>

01:42:58.838 --> 01:43:00.874
<i>A lot of people, even women,</i>

01:43:00.907 --> 01:43:02.876
<i>are skeptical
of harassment claims</i>

01:43:02.909 --> 01:43:05.344
<i>until they experience it
themselves,</i>

01:43:05.378 --> 01:43:07.246
<i>or know someone who has.</i>

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:09.416
Let me be that person for you.

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:10.450
As you can see,

01:43:11.317 --> 01:43:12.786
it's 20 million.

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:14.321
Plus the apology.

01:43:14.354 --> 01:43:16.223
- Mmm.
- Correct.

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:18.692
I can't believe
Fox agreed to the apology.

01:43:18.725 --> 01:43:19.893
I mean, it's unheard of.

01:43:19.926 --> 01:43:21.861
I mean, that never happens.

01:43:21.894 --> 01:43:23.964
But you will have to sign that.

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:26.933
It's a strict confidentiality
agreement.

01:43:26.966 --> 01:43:28.868
Money will establish
you told the truth,

01:43:28.901 --> 01:43:31.004
but no one can ever hear it
directly from you.

01:43:31.037 --> 01:43:33.473
You will be muzzled, Gretchen.

01:43:42.949 --> 01:43:43.983
Maybe.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:44:00.000
