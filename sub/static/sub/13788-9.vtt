WEBVTT

00:07.308 --> 00:11.442
Let me guess.
You're painting a cat's soul.

00:11.442 --> 00:12.713
I'm painting my mood.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.546
Wow, Avery.
I've never seen you this down.

00:15.546 --> 00:18.119
But don't worry,
I know how to cheer you up.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.321
♪ I'm your
furry fun technician ♪

00:20.321 --> 00:22.393
♪ Here to fix

00:22.393 --> 00:25.256

Infantile ♪

00:25.256 --> 00:31.062
♪ Time to make that
infant smile ♪

00:31.062 --> 00:33.164
Jazz paws!

00:35.506 --> 00:37.438
Nothin'?
Really?

00:37.438 --> 00:40.471
You always smile
at jazz paws.

00:40.471 --> 00:42.673
I really messed up with Wes.

00:42.673 --> 00:44.315
STAN: This is where
Avery went on and on

00:44.315 --> 00:45.646
About how she was
tutoring Wes in Spanish

00:45.646 --> 00:46.747
to get close to him.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.220
But she doesn't
know Spanish.

00:49.220 --> 00:51.352
So when he asked
her out in Spanish,

00:51.352 --> 00:52.383
she didn't know
what he was saying

00:52.383 --> 00:53.424
and turned him down.

00:53.424 --> 00:54.655
So now she's really bummed.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.757
-- really bummed.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.330
Okay, well,
just go tell Wes

00:59.330 --> 01:01.162
there was
a misunderstanding.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.494
That's what I would do
if I were in your shoes.

01:03.494 --> 01:07.238
In fact,
I am in your shoes!

01:07.238 --> 01:11.172
What?!
How did this happen?

01:14.505 --> 01:16.807
Yeah.

01:16.807 --> 01:18.409
Check it out.

01:18.409 --> 01:19.450
Hoo!

01:22.113 --> 01:24.485
There's the shaker.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.656
You getting this?

01:28.719 --> 01:29.860
Boom!

01:29.860 --> 01:31.522
Wow, I feel
so much better.

01:36.427 --> 01:38.569
Wow, that's hard.

01:38.569 --> 01:41.101
Try doing it
without proper knees.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.674
Maybe I do just
tell Wes the truth.

01:43.674 --> 01:45.576
That it was just
a misunderstanding.
That should be easy.

01:45.576 --> 01:46.877
You should call him
right now.

01:46.877 --> 01:48.479
No. I have time.

01:48.479 --> 01:49.710
This just happened
yesterday.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.582
It's not like he's just gonna
walk up to someone else

01:51.582 --> 01:53.414
and say "Do you want to
go out with me?"

01:53.414 --> 01:55.146
Do you want to
go out with me?

02:14.405 --> 02:15.736
You want me
to go out with you?

02:15.736 --> 02:16.837
Yeah.

02:16.837 --> 02:20.611
STAN:
Oh, snap! Driz-ama.

02:20.611 --> 02:22.373
It's like
a drama-cano erupted

02:22.373 --> 02:25.316
and now we're all living
in a drama-cracy.

02:25.316 --> 02:28.319
Now let's see how
we got there.

02:31.722 --> 02:33.324
Bye.

02:33.324 --> 02:34.325
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:34.325 --> 02:35.486
Oh, no,
it was my fault.

02:35.486 --> 02:37.258
I wasn't looking
where I was going.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.290
And usually
I staple my hats on.

02:39.290 --> 02:40.561
I'm kidding, gross.

02:40.561 --> 02:43.664
Okay, one time,
and only to my hair.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.496
Thanks.

02:45.496 --> 02:47.167
Oh, Lindsay, it's you.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.541
I didn't recognize you
without your hat.

02:50.541 --> 02:52.273
So I guess you heard,

02:52.273 --> 02:53.644
Avery totally shot me down.

02:53.644 --> 02:55.276
I thought Avery really
liked you.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.507
I kind of thought so, too,

02:56.507 --> 02:58.549
but I guess
she changed her mind.

02:58.549 --> 03:00.251
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:00.251 --> 03:01.712
Thanks.

03:01.712 --> 03:03.484
You're really cool.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.685
Do you want to
go out with me?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.617
You want me to go
out with you?

03:06.617 --> 03:07.888
Yeah, I have two tickets
to the movie

03:07.888 --> 03:10.291
in the park this weekend.
It'll be fun.

03:10.291 --> 03:14.194
I guess if Avery's
not interested anymore...

03:14.194 --> 03:15.466
I'd love to.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.469
Are you cold?

03:18.469 --> 03:20.401
I get happy chills.
It's normal.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.773
Not really.
But for me.

03:22.773 --> 03:25.936
Well, I'm happy too.

03:25.936 --> 03:27.938
That's not normal
for me.

03:29.640 --> 03:30.641
I will see you later.

03:30.641 --> 03:33.414
Bye!

03:33.414 --> 03:35.286
Hey, Lindsay,
have you seen Wes?

03:35.286 --> 03:36.547
I really need
to talk to him.

03:36.547 --> 03:37.918
STAN: This is where
Avery tells Lindsay

03:37.918 --> 03:39.720
what happened when
Wes asked her out.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.553
Spanish book, Spanish book.

03:42.553 --> 03:45.225
Lindsay says what happened
when Wes asked her out.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.728
Happy chills, happy chills.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.400
And she's all
"What the what?"

03:49.400 --> 03:52.303
And she's all
"I know, right?"

03:52.303 --> 03:53.764
And you said yes?

03:53.764 --> 03:55.606
Well, I guess I should have
talked to you first,

03:55.606 --> 03:58.869
but I was kinda stunned
and he put me on the spot and--

03:58.869 --> 04:00.411
Stop happy chilling!

04:00.411 --> 04:02.713
Happy chills?
Is it because I'm here?

04:02.713 --> 04:05.576
I do light up a room.

04:05.576 --> 04:08.519
Wes asked Lindsay out
and she said yes.

04:08.519 --> 04:11.582
What does everyone see in this
charming handsome Wes guy?

04:11.582 --> 04:12.683
I go for weird.

04:12.683 --> 04:13.954
Give me someone
who doesn't shower

04:13.954 --> 04:15.986
and laughs at
inappropriate times.

04:17.027 --> 04:18.028
Sup.

04:19.930 --> 04:21.732
So, Lindsay,
now that you know

04:21.732 --> 04:23.263
that I turned Wes down
by mistake,

04:23.263 --> 04:24.835
you can't go out with him.
Right?

04:24.835 --> 04:26.437
I mean, I'm the one
who had the crush on him

04:26.437 --> 04:29.640
this whole time, right?
Right?

04:29.640 --> 04:31.572
Right, you're the one
who had the crush.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.003
That's the upside
of weird dudes.

04:33.003 --> 04:36.677
There's plenty to go around
and nobody fights over them.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.349
Are you okay with this,
Linds?

04:38.349 --> 04:39.880
Yeah, yeah,
it's no big deal.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.653
It's just, you know, I got
asked out by a cute boy.

04:42.653 --> 04:44.415
That's like finding a dollar
bill on the ground...

04:44.415 --> 04:45.886
and then finding
the person who dropped it.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.057
You're like,
"Ooh, a dollar!"

04:47.057 --> 04:49.920
And then you're like,
"Oh, here."

04:49.920 --> 04:51.922
And that person
would have said

04:51.922 --> 04:53.624
"Thank you so much!"

04:53.624 --> 04:55.726
You never would have felt
right spending that dollar.

04:55.726 --> 04:59.600
And I would have said,
"Wow. It's just a dollar."

05:01.802 --> 05:03.574
Hey, Dad, you wanted
to talk to me?

05:03.574 --> 05:06.006
Yep, it's something
pretty cool.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.338
My cool or your cool?

05:07.338 --> 05:08.339
What's the difference?

05:08.339 --> 05:10.641
One is cool.

05:10.641 --> 05:12.683
I just got off the phone
with my publishing company

05:12.683 --> 05:14.945
about my new fathers
and sons book called

05:14.945 --> 05:16.647
Fathers and Sons.

05:16.647 --> 05:19.620
They wanted to pitch me
some cover ideas.
Better titles?

05:20.851 --> 05:22.753
Anyways I told them
that I wasn't interested

05:22.753 --> 05:24.495
in their pitches
because I already had

05:24.495 --> 05:26.497
a cover idea of my own,

05:26.497 --> 05:29.800
a picture of the author
and his son.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.364
But you're the author
and I'm your son.

05:33.364 --> 05:36.607
I know.
Pretty cool, huh?

05:36.607 --> 05:38.469
They fought me on it,
but I won.

05:38.469 --> 05:41.372
You see, son, when you
really want something,
you do not take "No,"

05:41.372 --> 05:43.414
or "No, are you serious?"
or "No,

05:43.414 --> 05:44.845
what is this, some
kind of vanity project?"

05:44.845 --> 05:46.617
for an answer.

05:46.617 --> 05:48.549
So my picture
will be on your book?

05:48.549 --> 05:49.880
No, Son.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.383
Our picture will be
on my book.

05:52.383 --> 05:54.485
What pose do you think?

05:54.485 --> 05:55.826
Action.

05:55.826 --> 05:58.529
Surprised.

05:58.529 --> 06:01.031
Bulls locking horns.

06:01.031 --> 06:03.494
Pointing
at an unknown object.

06:03.494 --> 06:05.936
Two guys just tickling
each other.

06:05.936 --> 06:07.938
Dad, stop!

06:07.938 --> 06:10.370
Listen, Dad, about
this cover thing,

06:10.370 --> 06:11.402
all my friends
will see it and...

06:11.402 --> 06:12.843
I know, Son.

06:12.843 --> 06:15.045
It's a dream come true
for me, too.

06:15.045 --> 06:16.146
CHLOE: Hey, guys.

06:16.146 --> 06:18.509
I can say that
'cause you're guys.

06:18.509 --> 06:22.513
If you were girls, I'd say
"Hey, powerful women."

06:22.513 --> 06:24.615
My teacher Pam
taught me that.

06:24.615 --> 06:26.987
She's a powerful woman.
And I am, too.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.061
Chloe, you are so cute.

06:31.061 --> 06:33.994
This face here would sell
so many books.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.628
You don't want this rotten
cantaloupe driving down sales.

06:37.628 --> 06:39.029
Chloe can't be on the cover.

06:39.029 --> 06:40.731
It's a book about
fathers and sons.

06:40.731 --> 06:43.403
So it's because I'm a girl?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.475
That's sexist.

06:44.475 --> 06:47.578
You're what Pam calls
"the problem."

06:47.578 --> 06:51.011
Sweetie, this isn't sexist,
it's a book about sons.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.613
And Tyler is my son.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.445
So if I was a boy,
I could be on it?

06:54.445 --> 06:55.486
Yes.

06:55.486 --> 06:56.747
Sounds sexist to me.

07:00.751 --> 07:03.093
I see you're getting ready
for your school presentation.

07:03.093 --> 07:05.155
Susan B. Anthony costume
is looking great.

07:05.155 --> 07:07.628
Susan B. Anthony wouldn't
care about looking great.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.730
She just cared about
women getting the vote.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.901
But thank you,

07:10.901 --> 07:12.563
'cause I've been working
so hard on it.

07:12.563 --> 07:14.665
I remember when I dressed up
like Annie Oakley.

07:14.665 --> 07:15.836
Not for school.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.738
It was for a commercial
selling cowhide rugs.

07:20.010 --> 07:21.041
Howdy, partners.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.212
Ow!

07:22.212 --> 07:23.544
Boy,
do we have a range

07:23.544 --> 07:24.945
of great rugs out here
on the Rug Ranch.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.777
Ow!

07:26.777 --> 07:28.018
So mosey on over.

07:28.018 --> 07:29.750
We won't steer you wrong.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.582
Ow!
Come on!

07:31.582 --> 07:32.853
ANNOUNCER:
--down to the Rug Ranch.

07:34.485 --> 07:36.727
Sounds less like
Annie Get Your Gun

07:36.727 --> 07:38.989
and more like "Annie,
Get Your Life Together."

07:40.731 --> 07:42.132
It was definitely
a wake-up call.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.595
Oh, if you're heading out
that way,

07:44.595 --> 07:45.936
can you take
this outside

07:45.936 --> 07:47.738
so the sun can
give it a weathered look?

07:47.738 --> 07:49.900
It's that kind of
attention to detail

07:49.900 --> 07:51.602
that gets you an invite
to the teachers' lounge

07:51.602 --> 07:54.004
for coffee cake
and inappropriate gossip

07:54.004 --> 07:55.876
about the other students.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.050
Hey, Avery.

08:00.050 --> 08:03.914
I'm all set to work on
our presentation and...

08:03.914 --> 08:06.056
I've got wigs!

08:06.056 --> 08:07.918
And they were free!

08:09.019 --> 08:10.160
They look free.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.723
And they smell
like the harbor.

08:12.723 --> 08:14.494
So how did it go
with Wes?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.226
Was it hard?
Did he understand?

08:16.226 --> 08:18.098
Should I call him now to tell
him I'll go out with him

08:18.098 --> 08:20.030
or wait till tomorrow?

08:20.030 --> 08:23.273
Free from, like, a person
or, like, a lost-and-found?

08:23.273 --> 08:24.875
A person.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.577
And wait till tomorrow.

08:26.577 --> 08:28.609
I actually haven't
talked to Wes yet.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.611
Oh?

08:30.611 --> 08:31.782
What's the hold up?

08:31.782 --> 08:33.213
Well, I just wanted
to enjoy the fact

08:33.213 --> 08:35.616
that I was asked out on a date
for a couple more hours.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.588
But I'll talk to him,
I promise.

08:37.588 --> 08:39.049
Free from a sea captain?

08:39.049 --> 08:40.651
Or a dock worker?

08:40.651 --> 08:42.593
They just
reek of low tide.

08:46.757 --> 08:48.058
Hey, can I ask you
for some advice?

08:49.700 --> 08:50.761
Who are you talking
to, sweetie?

08:50.761 --> 08:51.802
You.

08:51.802 --> 08:52.833
Me?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.204
You want to ask me
for advice?

08:54.204 --> 08:57.037
( kettle whistles )

08:58.669 --> 09:00.170
So can I ask you
for some advice?

09:00.170 --> 09:01.812
I don't know.
You've never done it before.

09:01.812 --> 09:04.645
You usually go to your dad
because he's the "professional"

09:04.645 --> 09:07.017
and "not prone
to emotional outbursts."

09:07.017 --> 09:09.219
Actually, I can't go to Dad
this time

09:09.219 --> 09:10.821
because it's about him.

09:10.821 --> 09:13.023
Well, that takes some
of the wind out of my sails,

09:13.023 --> 09:14.124
but I can row!

09:15.756 --> 09:17.928
Okay, shoot. No, wait,
let me get a notepad.

09:17.928 --> 09:19.189
No, you know, I want to
make eye contact.

09:19.189 --> 09:20.631
I'll just record this
on my phone.

09:20.631 --> 09:21.892
Yeah, I don't know how
to do that on my phone.

09:21.892 --> 09:23.834
We'll go old school.
You talk, I listen.

09:23.834 --> 09:25.966
I am so nervous.
Are you nervous?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.968
Mom, look.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.600
I really don't want to hurt
Dad's feelings

09:29.600 --> 09:32.202
but I don't want to be
on the cover of his book.

09:32.202 --> 09:33.874
This will be the most
humiliating thing

09:33.874 --> 09:35.105
that's ever happened to me.

09:35.105 --> 09:37.778
Gosh, my first instinct is just
to tell you to go talk to him,

09:37.778 --> 09:39.249
but that's too easy.

09:39.249 --> 09:41.682
I want to advise you so good
that when I'm a grandma,

09:41.682 --> 09:43.253
your children will feel
well-advised.

09:43.253 --> 09:44.955
Good one,
Nana.

09:46.016 --> 09:47.257
So let me just
really think about it

09:47.257 --> 09:48.288
and get back to you.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.260
Okay, Nana.

09:50.260 --> 09:51.622
No, not Nana,
not yet.

09:51.622 --> 09:55.125
I know I said that, but I'm
too young, too young.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.873
So here's my idea
for our presentation.

10:02.873 --> 10:05.806
I'll be Susan B. Anthony.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.337
Wait, if you have this
all figured out already,

10:07.337 --> 10:09.079
then why did
I bring these wigs?

10:09.079 --> 10:11.742
I know, it didn't make
sense to me either.

10:11.742 --> 10:14.044
Well, I thought we could
brainstorm on ideas together.

10:14.044 --> 10:15.746
Maybe we could be
two of Susan's followers

10:15.746 --> 10:17.287
who tell the story
of how she devoted her life

10:17.287 --> 10:18.649
to getting women the vote.

10:18.649 --> 10:20.150
Okay. Or...

10:20.150 --> 10:22.923
I could be Susan B. Anthony
because I have the costume.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.196
Or I could be
Susan B. Anthony

10:26.196 --> 10:27.698
because I'm not
getting the vote.

10:27.698 --> 10:28.959
Look, Linds.

10:28.959 --> 10:30.400
I'm sorry that I did this
without you.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.833
But it's not like I've got
everything figured out.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.835
I just did this costume.

10:34.835 --> 10:35.936
And that costume.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.340
Your dog even
has a costume?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.743
Yeah, doesn't
he look amazing?

10:42.743 --> 10:44.074
STAN: Well, I've got
the figure to pull off

10:44.074 --> 10:46.416
just about anything.

10:46.416 --> 10:49.419
Stan is going to be
Susan B. Anthony's dog.

10:49.419 --> 10:50.951
So when I recite her line

10:50.951 --> 10:52.322
about how women
without the vote

10:52.322 --> 10:54.825
might as well be dogs
baying at the moon,

10:54.825 --> 10:57.027
Stan will dramatize it
by howling.

10:57.027 --> 10:58.989
We'll get first place.

10:58.989 --> 11:01.161
Ooh, unless Toby Pointer
dresses up as Nixon

11:01.161 --> 11:02.392
and does the splits.

11:02.392 --> 11:06.767
It's not historically accurate,
but he can put on a show.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.168
This is just
like our presentation

11:08.168 --> 11:09.239
on Lewis and Clark.

11:09.239 --> 11:10.701
When you played
Lewis and Clark.

11:10.701 --> 11:11.942
And Sacajawea!

11:11.942 --> 11:13.343
And I was a buffalo.

11:13.343 --> 11:16.046
You hunted me for meat!

11:16.046 --> 11:18.178
You kept us alive,
Lindsay.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.680
We used
every part of you.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.452
And you have a very
important job this time.

11:22.452 --> 11:25.055
You're gonna be the reporter
who asks me questions.

11:25.055 --> 11:27.017
Well, okay, I guess
that could be fun.

11:27.017 --> 11:28.158
What costume will I wear?

11:28.158 --> 11:29.920
Anything you want.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.691
You'll be offstage
with a mic.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.965
You could even get
some more use out of
your buffalo costume.

11:34.965 --> 11:37.127
So the dog has a bigger part
than I do?

11:37.127 --> 11:38.198
How did that happen?

11:38.198 --> 11:41.031
STAN: It was a very
arduous audition process.

11:41.031 --> 11:42.873
Hi, I'm Stan.

11:42.873 --> 11:45.075
I'll be reading the role
of Miss Doralee Gilley

11:45.075 --> 11:48.138
from the 1980 film
"The Executary."

11:49.209 --> 11:50.981
I thought I'd dealt
with my last pig

11:50.981 --> 11:53.784
when I left the farm,
but I was wrong, Mr. Coleman.

11:53.784 --> 11:55.886
I was wrong!

11:55.886 --> 11:57.247
You're nothing
but an eye winkin',

11:57.247 --> 11:58.418
girl chasin',
male chauvinist--

11:58.418 --> 12:00.150
Thank you.

12:00.150 --> 12:03.894
I can also do that as
a Valley girl, if you want.

12:03.894 --> 12:06.426
Okay, so I figured out
everything before you got here.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.958
Usually you don't
mind that.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.160
Well, maybe this time
I want to be Susan B. Anthony.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.332
And maybe I want to go
to the movie with Wes.

12:12.332 --> 12:16.006
What does Wes have
to do with anything?

12:16.006 --> 12:17.737
What are we even
arguing about?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.739
The fact that you decide
everything in our friendship.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.971
If you were really
my friend,

12:20.971 --> 12:22.843
you'd understand
how much this means to me.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.775
I've never had a boyfriend
or even been asked out,

12:24.775 --> 12:25.946
you have!

12:25.946 --> 12:27.948
Lindsay, you're
gonna get asked out

12:27.948 --> 12:30.150
by tons of boys
who I won't like.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.882
What is that
supposed to mean?

12:31.882 --> 12:33.854
It means I liked Wes first!

12:33.854 --> 12:35.856
I mean, you didn't even like him
before he asked you out.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.327
Listen, I always liked Wes,

12:37.327 --> 12:39.459
but I wasn't allowed to
because you liked him.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.131
And you come first
in this friendship.

12:41.131 --> 12:42.162
But you had your
chance, Avery,

12:42.162 --> 12:43.263
and now it's my turn.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.865
I'm not canceling my date.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.096
I'm going to the movie
with Wes

12:46.096 --> 12:47.968
whether you
like it or not.

12:53.904 --> 12:55.205
What just happened?

12:55.205 --> 12:57.477
So this would be
a bad time to tell you

12:57.477 --> 12:59.950
I want to be
Susan B. Anthony?

13:04.454 --> 13:06.817
Hey there, cutes.
What do you got there?

13:06.817 --> 13:08.458
This is your book.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.060
I had an idea
for the cover.

13:10.060 --> 13:13.293
Oh, look, it's you.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.295
But where am I?
I'm not on here.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.368
Exactly.
Stings a little, huh?

13:19.569 --> 13:21.431
Look, Sweetie,
I know that you feel bad

13:21.431 --> 13:22.933
not being on my book--

13:22.933 --> 13:25.105
Pam says it's not okay
to talk down to someone.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.237
I'm not talking
down to you.

13:27.237 --> 13:28.839
You're up there,
I'm down here.

13:28.839 --> 13:32.012
Pam taught us the difference
between up and down.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.383
Up is where
the glass ceiling is

13:33.383 --> 13:36.086
and down is where the man
wants to keep us.

13:36.086 --> 13:40.090
Well, if you don't want to
be down there,

13:40.090 --> 13:41.121
how's this?

13:41.121 --> 13:43.954
I love being lifted.
Now swing me.

13:43.954 --> 13:48.859
Wheee!

13:48.859 --> 13:51.201
Don't tell Pam about this.

13:52.402 --> 13:54.404
I'm starting to wonder about
this teacher of Chloe's.

13:54.404 --> 13:55.465
Pam?
I love her.

13:55.465 --> 13:57.237
She asked me
to join her drum circle.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.338
Listen,
I need some advice.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.010
Let the good drummers
take the lead,

14:00.010 --> 14:01.471
you just play quietly
in the back.

14:03.513 --> 14:06.316
No, it's advice
about giving advice.

14:06.316 --> 14:08.548
But I just realized
I can't ask you

14:08.548 --> 14:10.881
for reasons
I can't really say,

14:10.881 --> 14:13.023
so I'll just have to
work it out myself.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.085
Why don't you ever lift me?

14:17.427 --> 14:18.959
This is hurting my arms.
It's hurting my pits.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.590
Why are we doing this?
I don't know.

14:20.590 --> 14:21.631
All right.

14:25.495 --> 14:26.596
This is crazy.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.238
Lindsay and I haven't
even talked

14:28.238 --> 14:30.070
since she
stormed out yesterday.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.301
I don't even know
what we're doing.

14:31.301 --> 14:33.343
Well, you're playing
Susan B. Anthony

14:33.343 --> 14:35.045
and I'm not because
my argument

14:35.045 --> 14:38.078
for non-traditional casting
fell on deaf ears.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.350
I guess we'll just get up
there and do our thing.

14:40.350 --> 14:42.282
Then maybe Lindsay
and I can talk

14:42.282 --> 14:44.514
and figure out this
whole Wes situation.

14:44.514 --> 14:47.087
Hopefully she'll do
the right thing and bow out.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.619
( laughs )

14:49.619 --> 14:51.191
It sounded like you said
"bow wow."

14:55.996 --> 14:57.897
Chloe, your class
came to see this?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.299
Yep, Pam thought
it would be

14:59.299 --> 15:00.630
a great lesson
for our class.

15:00.630 --> 15:03.103
When I told her you were
playing Susan B. Anthony,

15:03.103 --> 15:05.135
she got so excited
she picked me up.

15:05.135 --> 15:07.537
I'm getting lifted
a lot lately.

15:07.537 --> 15:09.309
It's pretty sweet.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.612
Max, you're not
even dressed up.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.685
I'm secret service protecting
all the presidents here.

15:15.685 --> 15:17.587
Oh-oh, John Wilkes Booth
is on the move.

15:17.587 --> 15:20.420
Nah, I don't want to mess
with history.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.023
Well, both of you
wish me luck.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.154
Oh, Nixon's going on.

15:24.154 --> 15:25.455
I'm up next.

15:25.455 --> 15:27.627
Oh, he's doing the splits.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.332
That's not
historically accurate!

15:34.604 --> 15:37.707
Ha! Not so limber now,
are you, Nixon?

15:37.707 --> 15:41.011
Wait, the splits was a metaphor
for his resignation.

15:41.011 --> 15:42.472
How did I not see that before?

15:42.472 --> 15:44.975
Brilliant work, Toby!

15:47.077 --> 15:48.718
Hello, other Susan.

15:50.981 --> 15:53.383
Lindsay? What are you doing
wearing that costume?

15:53.383 --> 15:54.554
I'm Susan B. Anthony.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.586
No.
I'm Susan B. Anthony.

15:56.586 --> 15:59.559
You're her evil twin
in an overpriced wig.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.731
At least that's what
it says in my speech.

16:01.731 --> 16:03.733
That's not
historically accurate!

16:03.733 --> 16:05.095
Wait, unless
it's a metaphor--

16:05.095 --> 16:07.467
No, that's not
historically accurate!

16:07.467 --> 16:09.039
And neither
is that hat!

16:11.401 --> 16:13.203
STAN: None of this
is in the script.

16:13.203 --> 16:15.105
What's my cue?
I might have missed it.

16:15.105 --> 16:17.177
When do I howl?
I'd better do it now.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.612
Indigestion?

16:22.612 --> 16:24.384
This is so embarrassing.

16:24.384 --> 16:28.388
Why did I eat
Oliver Wendell Holmes'
breakfast burrito?

16:28.388 --> 16:29.389
He liked me first.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.520
He likes me now.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.562
Oh, we'll see.
I'm going out with him!

16:32.562 --> 16:33.763
There's nothing
you can do about it.

16:33.763 --> 16:35.695
Oh, yeah?
All I have to do

16:35.695 --> 16:37.267
is explain
the misunderstanding,

16:37.267 --> 16:38.568
and you guys are over!

16:38.568 --> 16:42.272
No wonder it took us
so long to get the vote.

16:45.675 --> 16:47.137
What do you think
about my outfit, Stan?

16:47.137 --> 16:48.738
I want to look cute
when I tell Wes

16:48.738 --> 16:50.640
that I'll go out with him
and Lindsay's a jerk!

16:50.640 --> 16:52.582
But not like
I'm trying to look cute.

16:52.582 --> 16:55.085
You look great,
but I can't believe

16:55.085 --> 16:56.586
you're doing this
to Lindsay.

16:56.586 --> 16:58.248
She's your best friend.

16:58.248 --> 17:00.050
I mean,
I'm your best friend.

17:00.050 --> 17:01.251
I am your
best friend, right?

17:01.251 --> 17:02.722
Say it.
And pet me while you say it.

17:04.394 --> 17:06.796
Yes, you're my
best friend, Stan.

17:06.796 --> 17:09.299
You'd never betray me
like Lindsay did.

17:09.299 --> 17:10.700
She went after
the boy I liked.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.462
She is a bad friend.

17:12.462 --> 17:13.533
You know,
with dogs,

17:13.533 --> 17:15.665
every pack has an alpha
who's in charge.

17:15.665 --> 17:17.367
And sometimes
another dog steps up

17:17.367 --> 17:19.169
and tries to become
the alpha.

17:19.169 --> 17:21.541
And the alpha needs to put
that dog in its place.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.073
Exactly.

17:23.073 --> 17:24.614
I'm the leader,
she's fighting me,

17:24.614 --> 17:26.516
and I need
to put her in her place.

17:26.516 --> 17:28.248
That is a great
point, Stan.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.550
No!
My point is you're not dogs.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.252
Stop acting like it.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.583
Friendship isn't about
who's in charge.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.054
It's a two-way street.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.557
I liked the alpha dog thing
better a minute ago

17:37.557 --> 17:39.789
when I thought it was
supporting my position.

17:39.789 --> 17:42.292
I take back
a little bit of my petting.

17:42.292 --> 17:43.293
You can't.

17:43.293 --> 17:45.765
The tingle is already
in my fur.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.467
Just think about this,
Avery.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.139
If you have
to picture your life

17:49.139 --> 17:51.101
with only Wes
or Lindsay in it,

17:51.101 --> 17:52.402
who's in that picture?

17:56.376 --> 17:57.607
Mom, you around?

17:57.607 --> 18:01.151
Still need that advice.

18:01.151 --> 18:03.453
Mom, are you
hiding behind the curtains?

18:03.453 --> 18:05.255
No, I'm just busy.
Can't talk to you now.

18:05.255 --> 18:06.616
Busy...

18:06.616 --> 18:08.158
hiding behind the curtains?

18:09.259 --> 18:12.162
I'm not hiding.
This is my thinking spot.

18:12.162 --> 18:13.623
I'm thinking about the advice
I'm going to give you,

18:13.623 --> 18:14.864
so if you want good advice,

18:14.864 --> 18:17.397
you just need to leave
me alone to think.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.830
Behind the curtains?

18:20.830 --> 18:22.172
You know,
I had a thought,

18:22.172 --> 18:23.603
you just distracted
me from it.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.175
Now I have to start
all over again.

18:25.175 --> 18:26.376
I hope you're happy.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.845
I think she's lying about
getting ideas back here.

18:35.845 --> 18:38.488
Or did standing
back here

18:38.488 --> 18:40.790
give me the clarity
to see that?

18:40.790 --> 18:42.322
Whoa.

18:43.453 --> 18:44.854
Hey, just poking
my head in,

18:44.854 --> 18:45.895
seeing if you
needed anything.

18:45.895 --> 18:47.627
Actually, I could go for--

18:47.627 --> 18:49.729
Yeah, I don't really care
if you need anything.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.202
This advice thing is really
doing a number on me.

18:52.202 --> 18:53.403
So let me try
this again.

18:54.504 --> 18:56.336
Hypothetically speaking,

18:56.336 --> 18:58.208
if there was someone
named Tyler

18:58.208 --> 18:59.839
who didn't want to be
on the cover of your book

18:59.839 --> 19:01.541
but didn't want
to hurt your feelings,

19:01.541 --> 19:02.842
what would you advise?

19:02.842 --> 19:06.276
That you look up the word
hypothetically.

19:06.276 --> 19:08.248
Tyler doesn't want
to be on my book?

19:08.248 --> 19:09.619
Yeah, let's focus
on the positive.

19:09.619 --> 19:10.820
He came
to me for advice.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.682
Isn't that great?

19:12.682 --> 19:14.684
Tyler, get in here!
I want to talk to you!

19:14.684 --> 19:16.155
I was gonna say that!

19:16.155 --> 19:17.257
That's the advice
I was gonna give.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.189
Why didn't
I just go with my gut?

19:19.189 --> 19:20.430
Talk to your father.
That's my advice.

19:20.430 --> 19:21.431
I did that.

19:21.431 --> 19:22.462
Plenty more
where that came from.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.694
Come to me anytime.

19:24.694 --> 19:25.835
Tyler, take a seat.

19:25.835 --> 19:27.297
I'm gonna stay and watch.

19:27.297 --> 19:28.498
It was my advice,
so I get to.

19:28.498 --> 19:29.699
Don't mess this up,
Bennett.

19:29.699 --> 19:30.770
I've got a lot riding on it.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.801
And that's the last thing
I'm gonna say.

19:31.801 --> 19:33.543
I doubt it.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.777
Listen, Son,
if you don't want to be

19:37.777 --> 19:40.179
on the cover of my book,
that's fine.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.511
You can always
come talk to me.

19:41.511 --> 19:43.583
My advice.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.916
But, Dad, sometimes
parents push kids

19:46.916 --> 19:49.259
to do things they don't
really want to do.

19:49.259 --> 19:51.461
That creates
a sense of obligation

19:51.461 --> 19:53.393
which can push the father
and son apart.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.495
That's from my book.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.526
You read my book?

19:56.526 --> 19:58.968
Yeah,
I read all your books.

19:58.968 --> 20:00.199
You do?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.872
Of course.
You're my dad.

20:02.872 --> 20:08.308
Wow, this means
a lot to me, Son.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.409
Why didn't you
ever mention it?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.341
'Cause I knew
you'd get all "Wow,

20:11.341 --> 20:12.712
this means
a lot to me, Son."

20:12.712 --> 20:14.884
Did you know
I was gonna do this?

20:14.884 --> 20:16.386
Yes.

20:16.386 --> 20:20.390
This is the best advice
anyone has ever given.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.390
This jicama is really good.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.031
Yeah, finally
a vegetable for people

21:02.031 --> 21:04.994
who find celery too rich.

21:04.994 --> 21:06.436
Thanks for letting me
take the lead

21:06.436 --> 21:07.637
on the snacks tonight.

21:07.637 --> 21:08.798
It means a lot that
you did that.

21:08.798 --> 21:11.771
Well, friendship is
a two-way street.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.842
Yeah.

21:12.842 --> 21:14.544
But this jicama
is terrible.

21:14.544 --> 21:16.676
Why did I put it
in the bag with my wigs?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.752
Luckily, I brought my
just-in-case melon.

21:22.752 --> 21:25.054
You know, just in case.

21:25.054 --> 21:26.916
Oh, thank goodness.

21:26.916 --> 21:27.987
You're a good friend.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.620
I couldn't imagine us
ever not being friends.

21:30.620 --> 21:32.061
I'm just trying
to imagine the movie

21:32.061 --> 21:33.963
I can't hear
with all this talking.

21:33.963 --> 21:35.064
Sshh!

21:35.064 --> 21:36.996
Me?

21:36.996 --> 21:39.399
I don't know what
happened with Lindsay.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.870
But it's for the best.

21:40.870 --> 21:43.533
Avery is the one
I really wanted to go with.

21:47.977 --> 21:49.579
STAN: I'm glad
that Avery and Lindsay

21:49.579 --> 21:50.880
patched things up,

21:50.880 --> 21:52.542
and that I was able
to help a little.

21:52.542 --> 21:54.414
My only regret
is that unfortunate

21:54.414 --> 21:57.647
howl mishap at the
Historical People Pageant.

21:57.647 --> 21:59.649
But I did get a chance
to redeem myself

21:59.649 --> 22:02.992
at the movie in the park
when I saw the full moon.

22:02.992 --> 22:05.625
Schnauzer!

22:05.625 --> 22:07.697
Why did I eat so much jicama?

22:10.660 --> 22:12.562
Just let me give
you some advice!

22:12.562 --> 22:14.333
I don't need any advice!

22:14.333 --> 22:15.765
Everyone needs advice!
Not me!

22:15.765 --> 22:17.767
Don't run on the stairs!
Ha! There's some advice!

22:17.767 --> 22:19.769
That's not advice,
that's mothering!

22:21.741 --> 22:23.673
I'm counting it.

22:25.475 --> 22:29.849
Oh, Mom wants to give
advice to feel needed.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.581
Thanks,
Curtain.
