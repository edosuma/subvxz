WEBVTT

00:04.380 --> 00:05.464
Are they alive?

00:06.298 --> 00:08.509
Yes. Your mate and child
are being held by Karen.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.219
Where?

00:10.386 --> 00:12.471
Unfortunately,
we do not have that information.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.474
Maybe Karen's planning on using
them as bargaining chips.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.226
Quite possible.

00:17.476 --> 00:18.352
Possible?

00:18.436 --> 00:20.479
Our operatives
are trying to learn more

00:20.521 --> 00:22.523
and should have further
information in a few days.

00:23.274 --> 00:24.483
A few days? They could be dead
in a few days.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.484
Tom.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.362
Tom, where are you going?

00:28.446 --> 00:29.363
I'm going after them.

00:29.405 --> 00:30.322
I'm with you, Dad.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.407
You don't even know
where they are.

00:31.449 --> 00:32.366
- I'll find them.
- How?

00:32.450 --> 00:33.492
We'll figure that out.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.245
You know
that you're acting crazy.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.289
Dan, in case you hadn't noticed,

00:38.414 --> 00:39.457
crazy is where I live right now.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.458
I've got
a half-alien daughter.

00:40.499 --> 00:41.500
You want to tell me
how that happened?

00:42.251 --> 00:43.294
I wish I had the answer.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.462
I know who has the answer.
Karen.

00:44.503 --> 00:47.339
Now, you think that you're
going to help anybody,

00:47.381 --> 00:49.967
Anne, Alexis, anybody...
by going off half-cocked?

00:50.217 --> 00:51.677
You're not going to help Anne,
you're not going to help Alexis...

00:51.802 --> 00:53.387
I'm not doing anybody any good
sitting around here doing nothing.

00:53.429 --> 00:54.430
If you get captured or killed.

00:54.472 --> 00:55.347
Hal: Dad, listen to me.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.349
Our best shot is
to wait for the rebels

00:57.433 --> 00:59.268
to find out
where they're being held.

00:59.310 --> 00:59.810
Just“ Just give it 24 hours.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.145
- I will find...
- TOM: What if Karen kills them

01:01.228 --> 01:02.104
while we're sitting around on
our butts?

01:02.480 --> 01:04.023
WEAVER: If Karen's using them,
they're no good to her dead.

01:04.273 --> 01:06.358
She'll try to contact us,
make a deal.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.443
We got time
to do this the smart way.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.445
Tom!
Listen to me.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.530
You know
that if anybody understands

01:11.947 --> 01:13.074
what you're feeling right now,
it's me.

01:13.449 --> 01:14.492
24 hours.

01:15.326 --> 01:17.286
If we haven't heard anything
by then,

01:17.453 --> 01:19.371
you go with my blessing.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.419
Okay, 24 hours.

01:25.461 --> 01:27.088
This is...
Dad, this is crazy.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.089
Every second we wait

01:28.255 --> 01:29.340
- puts them in greater danger.
- I know how you feel.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.382
They're right.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.511
Tom...
can I have a word?

01:37.389 --> 01:38.432
Nice job.

01:38.516 --> 01:41.310
Anne and Lexie wind up dead,
it's on you.

01:43.479 --> 01:45.272
What's with your brother?

01:45.523 --> 01:48.400
Just“ scared of losing them.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.236
Dad, too.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.279
I understand why you're upset,

01:52.321 --> 01:55.241
but I need you to take a step
back, look at the big picture.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.325
Hal?

01:57.326 --> 01:59.370
We going to look
for Anne and Lexie?

02:01.330 --> 02:02.331
Hal?

02:05.417 --> 02:06.460
You okay?

02:09.463 --> 02:10.422
Hal?

02:13.342 --> 02:14.468
MARINA: I get why you
want to go after them.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.470
But frankly,
the timing couldn't be worse.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.055
With Cochise and the
president missing

02:18.222 --> 02:19.390
I presume dead...

02:19.640 --> 02:21.308
TOM: This plan never hinged
on the president.

02:21.392 --> 02:23.310
The Volm were prepared
to take casualties.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.311
They can proceed
without Cochise.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.272
They can proceed without me
if they have to.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.439
You've got
one overriding priority...

02:27.523 --> 02:29.524
complete construction of the rail spur

02:29.525 --> 02:32.236
to the Carolina Southern track
by the end of the month.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.280
You can put extra people on it
if you have to,

02:34.363 --> 02:35.281
but it needs to be done
by the time

02:35.364 --> 02:36.282
the Volm finish their device.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.449
Well, we need to talk
about that.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.286
I showed Dr. Kadar
your photos.

02:41.287 --> 02:42.371
Those photos were locked up.

02:43.539 --> 02:44.498
You went into my desk?

02:45.249 --> 02:46.333
It's not important
how I got them.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.459
The point is, Kadar thinks

02:47.543 --> 02:50.421
that the Volm are lying to us
about their device.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.340
I highly recommend
that we stop this project.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.466
Absolutely not!

02:54.550 --> 02:56.385
This is the only way
that we're going to win this war.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.387
Tom, we don't know
what this thing does.

02:58.429 --> 02:59.305
I did not put you in charge

02:59.388 --> 03:01.182
so you could derail
the entire war strategy.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.350
This has taken a lot
of planning, a lot of resources,

03:03.392 --> 03:04.310
and a hell of a lot of

03:04.351 --> 03:05.436
- diplomacy to pull off.
- And you might be wrong.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.478
- I'm not the enemy here.
- (VEHICLE APPROACHING)

03:06.520 --> 03:08.314
I'm just trying to get you
to think clearly.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.523
You can't leave me in charge

03:09.815 --> 03:11.609
and not give me the authority
to make decisions.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.443
TOM: I didn't give you

03:12.568 --> 03:13.527
- the authority to go into my...
- HAL: Dad!

03:13.652 --> 03:14.486
- But...
- Coming with me.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.988
(YELPS)

03:16.488 --> 03:18.240
Hal, what the hell
are you doing?

03:18.282 --> 03:19.283
Put your guns down.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.367
Hal.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.411
Do it, or I'll shoot her.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.417
Now get up.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.503
Get up!

03:33.297 --> 03:34.340
Get in.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.342
You're driving.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.640
Oh!

03:43.474 --> 03:44.183
HAL: Punch it!

04:02.326 --> 04:04.245
TOM: Talk to me, Hal.
What's going on?

04:04.328 --> 04:06.330
- Where are we going?
- We're going to see Karen.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.337
Maggie. It's Hal.
He's got a gun on Tom.

04:13.379 --> 04:15.297
Stop him.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.510
Hal, what's going on?
Come on! Talk to me!

04:20.302 --> 04:21.512
Get that gun out of my face!

04:23.472 --> 04:25.266
Damn it, Hal!
What's going on?

04:25.349 --> 04:26.517
Dad, I... I can't.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.269
It won't let me.

04:30.396 --> 04:31.355
MAGGIE: Out of the way!

04:47.371 --> 04:49.331
(GRUNTING)

04:51.333 --> 04:52.501
MAN: Go! Go!

04:53.419 --> 04:54.336
HAL: Don't even think
about it!

04:54.378 --> 04:55.462
Whoa!

04:57.339 --> 04:58.382
Hal?

05:03.387 --> 05:04.513
HAL: Next one
goes through his skull.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.348
TOM: Everybody,
put your guns down.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.434
Everybody, drop your guns!
That's an order, damn it!

05:08.475 --> 05:10.436
All right, all right. Just put
them down. Put them down.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.271
HAL: You try anything...

05:12.354 --> 05:13.147
I Will kill him.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.732
Hal?

05:21.655 --> 05:22.448
TOM: Hal?

05:23.282 --> 05:24.533
Damn it,
tell me what's going on!

05:25.409 --> 05:26.410
Sit!

05:31.373 --> 05:32.416
TOM: You're not my son.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.376
Oh, good for you, Professor.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.253
But I'm controlling him.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.421
So play nice.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.340
I might let you see him again.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.470
TOM: So, what's
your next move?

05:45.346 --> 05:47.389
Looks to me like your plan
just got shot to hell.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.393
Weaver's out there right now
surrounding the building.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.067
(GRUNTING)

05:59.443 --> 06:01.737
(SCREAMING)

06:05.532 --> 06:07.451
You do something
like that again,

06:08.243 --> 06:09.370
and you're going to get worse.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.330
Who are you?

06:11.372 --> 06:12.414
That doesn't matter.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.292
What matters is
Anne and your daughter.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.337
I can give you an opportunity
to save them.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.297
HOW?

06:20.464 --> 06:21.507
You tell me
everything that you know

06:22.257 --> 06:24.259
about the device
that the Volm are building

06:24.468 --> 06:27.388
where it's being deployed
and when.

06:28.514 --> 06:31.350
I'm never going to give you
that information.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.354
Yeah, we'll see about that.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.324
Second squad's covering
the back entrance.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.493
Nobody's getting in or out of that place
without us seeing them, Colonel.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.537
Very well. Get comms set up
between the units.

06:51.995 --> 06:52.704
On it.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.374
Hey.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.376
I thought I told you
to get to the infirmary.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.377
I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.254
Do you have any idea
what triggered this?

07:00.295 --> 07:01.463
I wish I knew.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.382
Maybe it's
post-traumatic stress.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.968
- We all have breaking points.
- It's worse than that.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.471
Hal's been having
emotional problems for weeks.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.390
What kind of emotional problems?

07:11.432 --> 07:12.516
Nightmares about Karen

07:13.308 --> 07:15.269
that he's been meeting her
outside the lines.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.355
He's convinced
she implanted something in him,

07:18.397 --> 07:20.482
and I didn't want to believe
it was true, but Hal did.

07:21.233 --> 07:21.900
Wait a minute.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.527
Are you saying the mole
we've been looking for is Hal?

07:24.445 --> 07:26.363
I should have told you.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.367
You knew?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.495
You knew, and you've been
covering up for him.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.374
Un-freaking-believable.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.460
So I guess it's your fault

07:39.501 --> 07:42.337
our illustrious President
has a gun to his head.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.423
WEAVER: Pointing fingers
won't change anything.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.383
Right now,
we got to figure out a way

07:46.425 --> 07:48.510
to get Hal and Tom
out of that building unharmed.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.387
Unharmed?

07:51.263 --> 07:53.432
Hal Mason murdered
Arthur Manchester.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.309
You have no proof of that.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.310
Stop it.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.479
Stop defending him.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.482
You knew he leaked information
to his Espheni girlfriend.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.442
He got dozens of us killed.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.320
WEAVER: That boy has saved the lives
of everyone out here

08:06.403 --> 08:08.280
at one time or another.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.449
He was a loyal soldier till
Karen got her claws into him.

08:10.491 --> 08:13.327
And you of all people
should know better.

08:13.410 --> 08:17.247
Instead, you bend over backwards
to make excuses for him.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.374
Why? Because a Mason couldn't
possibly be a traitor.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.418
Hey, Hal's not any more
responsible for his actions

08:21.460 --> 08:22.377
than a harnessed kid.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.420
So says spike boy, huh?

08:23.462 --> 08:25.506
Refuses to get
his own studs removed.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.300
Just going to get a taste
of that little alien DNA, huh?

08:28.342 --> 08:30.260
Mason family trait, I suppose.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.429
Hey! Hey!

08:32.513 --> 08:35.349
Get control of yourselves,
both of you.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.352
I'll kick both your butts
off the line!

08:54.368 --> 08:55.536
- Tector.
- TECTOR: Sir?

08:55.827 --> 08:57.371
Cover me.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.499
You got it, Colonel.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.418
Hal.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.298
Don't get yourself killed
out there.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.471
Hal!

09:18.392 --> 09:22.312
No one opens fire unless
I give the word, understood?

09:27.401 --> 09:29.319
Hal, I'm unarmed.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.364
I'm coming in to talk.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.536
Hal?

09:39.496 --> 09:40.455
WEAVER: Hal?

09:41.456 --> 09:42.499
Stay down.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.380
I'm coming in to talk.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.260
Here I am.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.304
Can I come in?

09:59.308 --> 10:00.434
That's close enough, Colonel.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.228
I can hear just fine.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.276
We know
Karen did something to you.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.527
Maggie's down here.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.362
Your brothers, too.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.364
We all care about you, Hal.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.325
We're real worried about you.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.409
What did Karen do to you?

10:18.285 --> 10:19.494
It doesn't matter now.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.539
It was last year
when she held us captive.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.499
She kissed you.
She put something inside of you.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.043
WEAVER: Let's work on this together,
Hal.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.463
Find a way to resolve it
so no one gets hurt.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.549
Hal, I know that you're still
in there fighting that thing.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.468
Tell me how I can help you.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.428
Hal?

10:37.429 --> 10:38.305
Hal?

10:38.388 --> 10:39.389
WEAVER: Talk to me, Hal.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.474
Tell me what you need.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.309
How can I help you?

10:43.435 --> 10:44.394
Hal?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.104
(PANTS)

10:46.229 --> 10:47.314
I need a...

10:53.403 --> 10:56.490
a gassed-up Humvee and
a safe passage to the perimeter.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.451
WEAVER: That didn't work before.
It's not going to work now.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.286
I can't let you leave.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.372
You give me what I need,
Colonel!

11:04.289 --> 11:05.540
Or you're going to be burying
Tom Mason!

11:06.291 --> 11:08.418
You know
you won't kill your dad, Hal.

11:16.468 --> 11:17.511
WEAVER: Cease fire!

11:20.263 --> 11:21.515
Cease fire, damn it!

11:22.265 --> 11:23.475
I said no shooting!

11:26.436 --> 11:27.479
WEAVER: Hal?

11:29.398 --> 11:30.357
Tom?

11:39.366 --> 11:40.409
WEAVER: Tom?

11:42.577 --> 11:45.205
(COUGHS)

11:45.414 --> 11:46.206
WEAVER: Hal?

11:48.417 --> 11:50.210
(TOM COUGHING)

11:50.419 --> 11:52.379
Easy. Easy.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.341
WEAVER: Hal?

11:58.343 --> 11:59.428
Tom?

12:00.429 --> 12:01.430
Go ahead. Answer him.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.308
Yeah, Dan! We're okay!

12:06.435 --> 12:08.311
TOM: Let's not try that again,
though, huh?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.359
Everything's under control now.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.278
Where do we go from here?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.447
Colonel, give me that Humvee.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.327
Okay, Hal.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.414
Maggie shot the hell
out of the one you were in.

12:28.123 --> 12:31.460
It's going to take us a while to get
a new one gassed up, though, but okay.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.296
My patience is wearing thin,
Colonel.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.380
Roger that.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.260
One Humvee, coming up.

12:47.142 --> 12:47.726
Sergeant.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.436
Colonel,
I think I can get in there.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.354
What are you talking about?

12:51.480 --> 12:52.481
Right up the side
of the building.

12:53.231 --> 12:53.523
He won't expect that.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.525
Your brother's picked his spot
pretty well, don't you think?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.236
He's got clear lines of sight
all the way around the building.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.404
No matter which way you go,
he'll see you coming.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.447
He won't shoot me.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.325
Yesterday, you'd have said
he'd never pull a gun on your father.

13:03.366 --> 13:03.867
Too risky.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.286
Might cost us your father,
your brother, you.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.455
Colonel, I'm going in there
to talk to Hal.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.165
Didn't you hear what
I just said to Ben?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.291
He'll listen to me.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.501
I can get through to him.
I know I can.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.296
And if you can't, you'll be giving him one
more hostage that he can use against us.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.255
No.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.298
Got to be a better way.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.383
Can somebody explain
something to me?

13:20.467 --> 13:23.303
Why is it that if anybody else

13:23.386 --> 13:26.306
had have acted like an alien
and shoot people,

13:26.473 --> 13:28.308
you'd have blown
their brains out

13:28.350 --> 13:30.393
and used what's left
of their skull as an ash tray?

13:30.477 --> 13:32.479
Hal didn't shoot anybody.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.440
He could have killed
the colonel. He chose not to.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.317
POPE: I'm just saying, Mags,

13:37.359 --> 13:39.486
we can't count
on your boyfriend's restraint

13:39.528 --> 13:41.279
from here on in.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.281
You don't have to
count on anything, Pope.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.450
I need cool heads up here
who do as they're told.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.329
Take your Berserkers
and get lost. Dismissed.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.373
That's the smartest idea
I've heard all day,

13:51.456 --> 13:52.499
Colonel, sir.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.501
Come on.
Let's head over to the nest.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.378
I don't think
we need any more front seats

13:56.419 --> 13:58.505
to the latest
Mason family drama.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.423
Lyle, you're buying first round.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.300
LYLE: No, I'm not.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.305
MARI NA: Sergeant.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.267
Ma'am.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.436
Can you stop Hal from shooting
Tom if it comes to that?

14:17.482 --> 14:18.441
Yes, ma'am.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.361
About 300 yards, give or take.

14:22.279 --> 14:23.405
Switch is right here.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.491
Put a round through there,
it'll turn him off like a light.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.536
Colonel,
if this situation falls apart,

14:29.703 --> 14:31.454
we might end up
with a split-second decision

14:31.496 --> 14:33.415
between saving Tom
and saving Hal.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.332
Won't come to that.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.376
You can't promise that, Dan.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.295
I know how close you are to Tom.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.421
I know how difficult it would be

14:39.462 --> 14:41.423
to order the death of his son.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.509
But if push comes to shove
and you can't give that order,

14:45.510 --> 14:47.345
I will relieve you.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.323
They still okay?

15:06.406 --> 15:08.408
As far as I know.
Nothing's changed.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.287
WEAVER: What's going on up there?

15:12.329 --> 15:13.288
I want to know where Hal is.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.290
I want to know where Tom is...
what they're doing.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.249
I was scoping it out.
There's a couple places

15:17.250 --> 15:19.377
I could lay eyes on the target
without being spotted.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.255
Let's make one thing
perfectly clear, Tector...

15:22.297 --> 15:23.340
Hal is not the target.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.383
He's one of ours.

15:25.508 --> 15:26.509
The aliens messed him up,

15:27.260 --> 15:28.428
but we're not going to let them
get away with that.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.263
We're going to get him back.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.432
This situation ends with
everybody alive, understood?

15:32.474 --> 15:34.434
Roger that, sir.
Can do.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.316
Anthony.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.527
You're not going to shoot
my brother, are you?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.447
Orders say not to.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.492
Orders can change.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.495
Yes, they can.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.543
This sucks.

16:02.504 --> 16:03.421
Yeah.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.466
I don't see how this ends
without Hal getting hurt.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.426
Or your dad.

16:09.177 --> 16:09.678
Or both.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.514
You were right.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.516
You should go up there
and talk to Hal.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.354
There's no way to get in there
without being seen.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.314
There is.

16:23.441 --> 16:24.526
Show me.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.403
Count me in.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.450
You know as soon as you
get near that Humvee,

16:32.534 --> 16:34.285
Weaver's going to take you out.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.247
I wouldn't be surprised
if he didn't have Tector

16:37.330 --> 16:38.456
lining you up in his sights
right now.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.335
You're going to die for nothing.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.462
Colonel Weaver ain't going to kill
his best friend's son.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.423
No, Dan Weaver wouldn't do that.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.550
But he's not calling the shots
down there.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.427
Marina Peralta is.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.389
And if you're betting
that she wouldn't give the order

16:55.557 --> 16:56.474
or that Tector would miss...

16:58.518 --> 17:00.270
You're going to lose.

17:03.481 --> 17:04.482
Look, there is one way

17:04.524 --> 17:06.443
that I can see us
getting out of this.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.446
You have Karen release
Anne and Lexie,

17:09.487 --> 17:10.530
bring them safely back
to Charleston.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.449
We can talk about the Volm plan.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.409
Or you give me the Volm plan,

17:14.451 --> 17:16.369
and I'll give you
Anne and your daughter.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.460
Matt: We're here.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.253
Maggie: You sure?

17:25.295 --> 17:26.379
Matt: Of course I am.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.506
These tunnels run
all through Charleston.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.425
My buds and I have
been through most of them.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.260
Ditching school?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.262
Paid off, don't you think?

17:37.307 --> 17:40.310
POPE: Okay, the odds
against both Masons living

17:40.393 --> 17:44.439
through this little drama
have just gone up.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.400
And why not put a little down
on the long shot?

17:47.442 --> 17:50.320
Could pay off quite handsomely
if the Gods intervene.

17:50.361 --> 17:51.321
Lyle, what do you say?

17:51.404 --> 17:54.240
Yeah, I'd lose my bet
on Tector missing the shot.

17:54.324 --> 17:54.908
POPE: Come on, Lyle.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.409
Maybe they'll, uh...
they'll talk their way out

17:56.493 --> 17:58.369
of this thing. And if you win,

17:58.578 --> 17:59.496
you can buy a couple of keggers

17:59.579 --> 18:00.497
for that trip down to Mexico.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.332
Yeah, and how long
do they have to survive

18:02.373 --> 18:03.416
before you pay off?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.502
I mean, if Hal is the traitor

18:05.627 --> 18:06.753
that murdered Manchester...

18:07.295 --> 18:09.422
Hal Mason doesn't
even need to survive a trial

18:09.464 --> 18:11.424
in order to pay off
in that category.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.426
Put $20 on "both die" for me,

18:13.468 --> 18:15.386
and I'll take them out myself.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.349
No, no, no.
Easy, there, amigo.

18:19.390 --> 18:22.435
This is not a call to action,
my friends.

18:22.519 --> 18:26.439
It's just a friendly wager on
the fates of a couple of guys.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.399
Don't even think about it.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.361
You in or out?

18:38.243 --> 18:38.785
Okay.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.286
Up here.

18:44.499 --> 18:45.458
Okay.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.295
So, if you don't care
about your own life,

18:49.462 --> 18:51.422
consider who else might get hurt

18:51.506 --> 18:53.299
if you don't give me
the information I need.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.342
Aah!

18:56.344 --> 18:57.470
Now, I could have killed Weaver.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.389
I believe you know that.

18:59.514 --> 19:03.518
Next time,
it might be Ben or maybe Matt.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.313
Why don't you think about that?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.402
I should have seen this coming.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.364
I should have noticed
what was going on with you.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.370
I'd love to say that it was

19:22.412 --> 19:24.289
because I was too busy
with my job,

19:24.330 --> 19:27.500
but... I think we both know
that it started way before that.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.545
Before the invasion even.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.380
I missed
a lot of lacrosse games.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.299
I missed a lot of dinners.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.511
But your mom was always there.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.270
You know what she thought
you were going to be?

19:49.272 --> 19:50.398
A fighter pilot.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.485
Oh, really?

19:55.445 --> 19:57.322
Personally, though,
I didn't see it.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.327
And why not?

20:02.535 --> 20:05.288
Well, the thing
about being a pilot is

20:05.413 --> 20:08.333
one lapse in concentration,
one wrong judgment,

20:08.374 --> 20:09.375
and you're dead.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.544
I didn't think
you had that kind of focus.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.505
But after fighting next to you

20:15.423 --> 20:16.466
for the last two years,

20:16.507 --> 20:22.263
side by side, watching you
lead men and women into battle,

20:23.348 --> 20:25.350
I realized that, as usual,
your mom was right.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.269
And I really wish

20:28.311 --> 20:30.396
that she'd lived to see
the man that you've become.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.528
She really loved you, Hal.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.499
Come on, Hal.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.253
Give it to me.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.338
Shut up!

20:56.381 --> 20:57.465
And sit down!

21:00.301 --> 21:02.262
(SOBBING) Or I'm going to shoot.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.430
I don't think that you will.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.229
It's that one.

21:14.357 --> 21:15.483
I'll go first.

21:19.404 --> 21:20.446
Maggie.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.242
Yeah.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.334
Hal.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.336
- Hey!
- Don't do this.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.340
This isn't you.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.509
You can beat this, Hal.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.428
You're stronger than Karen.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.723
- Give me the gun.
- (HAL SOBBING)

21:49.434 --> 21:50.310
MATT: Hal.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.439
You can do it, Hal.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.357
You can fight it.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.987
(SCREAMS)

22:02.363 --> 22:03.448
Give me the gun.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.286
No. Y-you're not going to
hurt him.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.412
You're not going to
hurt your family.

22:09.454 --> 22:10.413
Hal.

22:11.289 --> 22:12.415
Baby.

22:13.416 --> 22:14.250
Give me the gun.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.251
MAGGIE: Hal.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.377
Come on.

22:17.378 --> 22:20.298
That's it. You can do it.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.258
Give me the gun.

22:22.425 --> 22:25.011
(sesame)

22:25.261 --> 22:25.762
No.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.268
I'm sorry.

22:33.311 --> 22:34.520
- I can't...
- Don't.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.523
Hal. Baby.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.442
Don't.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.319
TOM: Hal.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.949
- Aah!
- (GLASS SHATTERS)

22:48.034 --> 22:50.828
(GRUNTING, SHOUTING)

22:52.663 --> 22:53.873
(GUNSHOT)

22:57.293 --> 22:59.379
(PANTING)

23:02.340 --> 23:03.424
Anthony, go!

23:03.466 --> 23:05.301
Let's move!

23:15.269 --> 23:16.229
He's alive.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.523
And kicking!

23:19.273 --> 23:21.484
But he's not
out of the woods yet,

23:22.235 --> 23:27.365
so, no, I will not be
paying out on "both survive,"

23:27.407 --> 23:30.451
at least not until this little
family drama plays itself out.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.537
Once we have
final determination,

23:33.287 --> 23:34.539
the house will make good
on all bets.

23:35.289 --> 23:36.416
In the meantime,

23:37.291 --> 23:40.461
if Hal Mason survives,

23:41.295 --> 23:43.339
the next pool will be odds

23:43.381 --> 23:44.507
on whether or not

23:45.258 --> 23:47.468
the son of our esteemed civic
leader will be charged with...

23:47.677 --> 23:49.512
(DRUM ROLL)

23:51.305 --> 23:53.349
espionage...

23:55.435 --> 24:00.314
the murder
of Arthur Manchester, or...

24:02.442 --> 24:04.444
he walks soot-free.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.320
MAN: No way!

24:08.448 --> 24:09.449
Drink up.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.242
Ponder the possible...

24:31.345 --> 24:32.388
Whiskey.

25:14.472 --> 25:16.307
One for the road.

25:25.483 --> 25:26.526
Colonel.

25:33.533 --> 25:38.412
If anybody tries to affect
the odds on that board

25:38.454 --> 25:40.289
one way or another,

25:41.332 --> 25:44.544
I will personally
mount your head

25:46.295 --> 25:48.256
on the wall
of this establishment.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.476
I'd call that a safe bet.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.455
Hey, Lyle?

26:22.331 --> 26:24.333
Why don't you head over
to the infirmary?

26:24.417 --> 26:26.335
If you see any funny business,

26:27.336 --> 26:28.504
you take the comedy
right out of it.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.381
Count on it, boss.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.229
LOURDES: Hey. He'll be fine.

26:45.313 --> 26:46.480
Bullet just grazed his head.

26:47.315 --> 26:49.442
Scalp is lacerated,
but no cranial damage.

26:49.483 --> 26:50.484
Possible concussion.

26:50.526 --> 26:53.279
I won't know for sure
until I do some more tests.

26:53.321 --> 26:55.406
All in all, though,
I'd say he's pretty lucky.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.365
Could we see him?

26:56.449 --> 26:58.367
In a couple hours.
He's still not fully conscious.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.369
Did you find anything
that could have caused this,

27:00.453 --> 27:01.329
like an eyebug?

27:01.370 --> 27:03.331
I took a full set
of head and neck X-rays.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.416
There's nothing
that showed any sign of that.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.418
MAGGIE: That doesn't mean
nothing's there.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.420
LOURDES: I'm going to follow up
with a full blood panel.

27:09.795 --> 27:10.463
TOM: What will that
tell you?

27:11.255 --> 27:12.340
Well, a foreign body
in the brain

27:12.381 --> 27:14.467
causes surrounding cells
to release proteins.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.344
If his protein level is
high enough,

27:16.427 --> 27:17.470
we might detect it in the blood.

27:17.511 --> 27:19.347
How does any of this help Hal?

27:20.306 --> 27:21.474
I can't remove what I can't see.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.311
Maybe it's already gone.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.315
It knew we had Hal.
It might have escaped.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.483
Sounds like we need
more information.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.525
LOURDES: Exactly.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.527
Eyebugs are Espheni technology.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.404
If anyone knows
about the fishheads...

27:35.446 --> 27:36.489
It's the rebel Skitters.

27:38.449 --> 27:41.285
Each one of these bugs is
genetically engineered

27:41.327 --> 27:43.245
to be controlled
by a single individual,

27:43.287 --> 27:45.331
the individual who implanted it.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.291
Removal is most easily
accomplished

27:47.333 --> 27:48.292
by that same individual.

27:48.376 --> 27:49.502
But if that individual is
not available,

27:50.044 --> 27:51.379
you have another way
to take it out?

27:51.504 --> 27:52.463
Yes.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.507
We have developed
a biological hunter-killer.

27:55.257 --> 27:56.509
It's a very...
aggressive remedy

27:57.259 --> 27:59.303
designed to hunt for the bug
on a molecular level.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.347
Would that even work
on a human being?

28:01.514 --> 28:05.351
In theory, but it is
an instrument of last resort.

28:05.393 --> 28:07.269
You must understand
that there are risks.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.480
Our anatomy, our biology,
our body chemistry

28:09.522 --> 28:11.524
are vastly different
from your own.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.319
But I'm out of options.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.448
I need to know
that if I give this to my son,

28:19.490 --> 28:21.367
it's going to kill
the bug inside of him.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.369
It will kill the bug
if there is one.

28:23.411 --> 28:25.538
If not,
it will kill your son instead.

28:32.503 --> 28:33.504
How does it work?

28:43.848 --> 28:46.475
(THUNDER RUMBLES IN DISTANCE)

28:53.482 --> 28:55.526
I've got an impossible
choice to make.

29:00.281 --> 29:01.407
If I do nothing,

29:03.325 --> 29:04.452
my son is lost to me.

29:05.536 --> 29:08.414
And if I do the thing
that I need to do to save him,

29:10.416 --> 29:12.293
I could still lose him.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.470
My grandmother used to say,

29:24.305 --> 29:25.389
"The minute we love,

29:26.390 --> 29:28.517
the world has
something to use against us."

29:30.519 --> 29:32.396
- Smart woman.
- Hmm.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.404
She also said, "Death is
not the worst of all evils."

30:05.346 --> 30:06.430
Maggie.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.391
You got to get me out of here.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.394
I can't.

30:13.354 --> 30:14.313
You can.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.482
The bug's gone.

30:18.192 --> 30:18.692
It left.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.278
I felt it leave.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.281
Lourdes told me
what they're going to do to me.

30:27.284 --> 30:28.327
They're going to kill me.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.287
There's no bug.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.372
It's gone.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.498
Nobody believes me.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.376
You know I'm not going to survive this.
You got to help me.

30:35.501 --> 30:36.502
Hal.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.465
I know where Karen's keeping
Anne and Lexie.

30:43.384 --> 30:44.260
Where?

30:44.426 --> 30:45.386
Come with me.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.428
If you come with me,

30:46.470 --> 30:48.347
if I get them and I rescue them,

30:48.389 --> 30:51.308
I bring them back alive,
they'll have to believe me.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.434
It'll prove I'm fine.

30:54.228 --> 30:55.354
It's them or me, Maggie.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.315
Help me. Just help me.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.279
I can't.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.488
Maggie,
you're not listening to me.

31:05.281 --> 31:06.365
I swear to you this bug's gone.

31:07.241 --> 31:08.284
Don't let them do this.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.410
Look at me. Hey.

31:09.451 --> 31:10.452
Look at me.

31:11.412 --> 31:12.413
Hey.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.375
Undo that strap.

31:17.293 --> 31:19.336
I want to believe you, Hal.

31:19.503 --> 31:20.462
Do it.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.506
Just undo that strap.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.259
Maggie.

31:25.426 --> 31:26.385
I can't.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.470
Do it! Maggie!

Mag...

31:33.392 --> 31:34.351

31:34.560 --> 31:36.477
(PANTING) You got to believe me.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.480
Dad, listen,
you got to cancel this thing.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.316
I don't want to die like this.

31:40.357 --> 31:41.442
I'm sorry, Hal.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.485
(SOBBING)
I don't want to die, Dad.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.321
I'm not going to
let them take you from me.

I don't want to die
like this, Dad!

(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

35:20.494 --> 35:22.287
Hey.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.456
What's going on?

35:36.260 --> 35:36.760
You don't remember?

35:37.386 --> 35:39.388
Last thing I remember
was going to talk to you

35:40.472 --> 35:42.432
about these nightmares
I was having with Karen,

35:42.516 --> 35:43.517
but you were gone.

35:44.518 --> 35:46.311
And Colonel Weaver wouldn't
tell me where you went.

35:46.353 --> 35:47.437
That was a week ago.

35:53.527 --> 35:54.528
What happened?

35:55.320 --> 35:58.240
You don't remember
taking your father hostage?

35:59.449 --> 36:00.409
What?

36:02.452 --> 36:04.288
You had a bug, Hal.

36:05.289 --> 36:06.373
We got it out.

36:10.252 --> 36:11.295
So, I was right.

36:12.421 --> 36:13.422
Yeah.

36:15.257 --> 36:16.300
I was wrong.

36:16.425 --> 36:17.384
I'm sorry.

36:19.261 --> 36:20.304
I'm the mole.

36:21.263 --> 36:22.347
Not anymore.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.520
So that means
I did all those things.

36:30.314 --> 36:31.398
I'm responsible for all that.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.399
No, Hal.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.528
You're not responsible
for anything Karen made you do.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.449
She is. Not you.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.367
Maggie's right.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.088
TOM: Rebel Skitters
came through.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.298
Anne and Lexie are being held

36:56.340 --> 36:58.425
in an Espheni outpost
in Mechanicsville.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.344
So, you're going after them?

37:00.385 --> 37:01.386
I am.

37:02.346 --> 37:03.305
I know it's occurred to you

37:03.388 --> 37:05.390
that Karen took Anne
to draw you out of Charleston.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.267
It's a trap.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.435
Tom, this is not smart.

37:08.518 --> 37:11.396
No, it's not smart,
but like you said, Marina,

37:11.480 --> 37:13.398
the minute that we love,

37:13.523 --> 37:16.276
the world has
something to use against us.

37:17.277 --> 37:20.322
I'm fighting for people I love
with people I love.

37:21.323 --> 37:23.367
That should give me an edge.

37:26.536 --> 37:29.331
The complete file,
not just the photographs.

Everything you need to know
about the Volm device,

37:31.333 --> 37:32.251
when it's going to be deployed,

37:32.292 --> 37:33.502
and what we need to do
to get it there.

37:34.378 --> 37:37.297
And that is
my signed letter of resignation.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.259
Effective immediately.

37:45.514 --> 37:49.309
I, uh... I'm going to do things
my way.

37:50.269 --> 37:51.478
Haven't you already
been doing that?

37:52.354 --> 37:53.522
Making your own decisions?

37:55.482 --> 37:57.150
One word of advice -

37:59.403 --> 38:00.487
be straight with the Volm.

38:01.530 --> 38:03.240
We need them to win.

38:03.282 --> 38:06.410
If you have any problems or any concerns
you should really go to Dan Weaver.

38:07.411 --> 38:09.288
He's been my strong right arm.

38:09.329 --> 38:10.414
He can be yours, too.

38:11.331 --> 38:13.250
- Tom...
- The buck stops with you.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.424
Good luck to you.

38:21.383 --> 38:22.509
Good luck to you, Tom.

38:39.234 --> 38:40.319
Maggie.

38:42.279 --> 38:43.322
I love you.

38:43.447 --> 38:44.531
Remember that.

38:52.414 --> 38:53.457
Everybody ready?

38:55.250 --> 38:58.253
Yep. Let's go.

38:59.338 --> 39:02.299
All right, got food, water
for the next few days,

39:02.341 --> 39:04.343
maps, plenty of ammo.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.345
What else do you need?

39:07.512 --> 39:09.306
You.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.435
Wish to hell
I was going with you.

39:14.311 --> 39:15.437
Doesn't feel right.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.397
I know.
You got to be here.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.442
Somebody got to
hold down this fort.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.488
And you know I got Jeanne
to think about now.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.448
I know. I understand.

39:30.369 --> 39:31.536
So, get it done.

39:32.454 --> 39:35.457
If you're not back soon,
I'm going to come looking for you.

39:38.418 --> 39:39.503
Noted.

39:45.509 --> 39:46.385
Hey.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.513
We all know
the bug made you do it.

39:50.263 --> 39:51.390
Now go find Anne.

39:57.312 --> 39:58.355
Let's mount up.

40:12.536 --> 40:13.537
POPE: Hey, Lyle.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.415
Remind me to pull
the old eyebug defense

40:16.456 --> 40:19.418
next time
somebody wants to lock me up.

40:20.377 --> 40:21.503
Don't let it get to you.

40:59.249 --> 41:00.333
JUDGE: Raise your right hand.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.501
Repeat after me.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.463
I, Marina Louise Peralta...

41:05.380 --> 41:07.340
I, Marina Louise Peralta...

41:07.424 --> 41:09.259
do solemnly swear...

41:09.301 --> 41:10.427
do solemnly swear...

41:10.469 --> 41:12.262
<i>Judge: to faithfully execute</i>

41:12.304 --> 41:15.432

41:16.266 --> 41:17.350
To faithfully execute

41:17.392 --> 41:20.353
the office of President
of the new United States.

41:20.437 --> 41:23.440
<i>JUDGE: To preserve, protect,
and defend the constitution.</i>

41:23.482 --> 41:25.484
We're going to find them, Dad.

41:26.276 --> 41:26.776
Yep.

41:27.319 --> 41:30.280
To preserve, protect,
and defend the constitution

41:30.322 --> 41:31.490
so help me, God.

41:32.324 --> 41:33.492
So help me, God.
