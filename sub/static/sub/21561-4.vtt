00:32.529 --> 00:34.295
Captain Slattery was last seen

00:34.298 --> 00:35.758
underneath the fight arena.

00:35.761 --> 00:38.015
Vulture team split up
to take on the hostiles.

00:38.017 --> 00:39.917
CO had the package.

00:39.919 --> 00:41.541
Somehow he got cut off from the rest,

00:41.544 --> 00:43.732
and he's been radio silent ever since.

00:43.735 --> 00:46.190
- With the seeds?
- Yes, sir. With the seeds.

00:46.192 --> 00:48.792
And no word on the buyer. Who
he is? What his assets are?

00:48.794 --> 00:50.130
No, sir. As a precaution,

00:50.133 --> 00:52.663
I recommend Nathan James move
to a more secure location.

00:52.665 --> 00:56.033
I've identified a jagged
stretch of coastline here.

00:56.035 --> 00:58.001
2 nautical miles north of our PIM.

00:58.003 --> 01:00.423
It will hide the ship, but also
allow us to remain close enough

01:00.425 --> 01:02.573
to maintain radio contact
and help with exfil.

01:02.575 --> 01:04.806
Very well. And you're
sure of what you heard,

01:04.809 --> 01:06.376
about who joined the team on the ground?

01:06.378 --> 01:08.165
Yes, sir. Tom Chandler.

01:12.246 --> 01:15.786
All right. The fight pit's
here. Nora Pula's this way.

01:15.788 --> 01:17.087
Where are your rally points?

01:17.089 --> 01:18.896
Rally point Alpha is here.

01:18.899 --> 01:20.991
Abandoned square outside
of town, 2 clicks west.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.559
Helo's still doing racetracks.

01:22.561 --> 01:24.698
Should've only taken him,
what, 15 minutes on foot?

01:24.700 --> 01:27.197
- He's gotta be hurt.
- Or they already found him.

01:27.199 --> 01:28.699
No, I don't think so.

01:28.701 --> 01:31.034
There's still too many
bad guys out there looking.

01:31.036 --> 01:34.071
Uh, RHIB's parked at rally
point Bravo, on the beach.

01:34.073 --> 01:36.721
It'll be crawling with
Giorgio's men very soon.

01:36.724 --> 01:38.609
We took his yacht into town.

01:38.611 --> 01:41.411
Diaz, this is Green. Be on
the lookout for the CO on E&E.

01:41.413 --> 01:43.213
Roger that. Eyes open.

01:43.215 --> 01:44.929
How many men does Giorgio have?

01:44.932 --> 01:48.085
Dozen or so fighters.
His personal detail.

01:48.087 --> 01:50.120
Omar travels with an army.

01:51.490 --> 01:53.323
Streets are getting hot. We gotta move.

01:53.325 --> 01:55.359
All right, we break up into small teams.

01:55.361 --> 01:57.528
Hit both rally points
simultaneously in case...

01:57.530 --> 01:58.862
Split up?

01:58.864 --> 02:00.430
We're already outnumbered.

02:00.432 --> 02:03.000
We stay together, we stand
a chance if things go south.

02:03.002 --> 02:04.802
Who are you? Who is he?

02:04.805 --> 02:06.571
Part of the team that's
been saving the world

02:06.574 --> 02:09.339
for the last year.

02:11.577 --> 02:13.911
Captain Slattery is on evade and escape,

02:13.913 --> 02:15.179
operating in the blind.

02:15.181 --> 02:17.354
No comms, no weapons, possibly injured,

02:17.357 --> 02:18.590
and carrying what seems to be

02:18.593 --> 02:20.320
the most important thing in the world.

02:20.323 --> 02:22.586
Since we know where he's
heading, we have an advantage.

02:22.588 --> 02:24.188
Small groups means more flexibility,

02:24.190 --> 02:25.956
the ability to move faster

02:25.958 --> 02:28.609
and possibly... hopefully... Find him.

02:28.612 --> 02:30.533
But that's just my opinion.

02:30.536 --> 02:32.875
I'm new here. It's your show.

02:35.131 --> 02:36.697
We split up.

02:39.271 --> 02:42.873
It is an honor, Captain Tom.

03:29.525 --> 03:31.525
You two are the butt of the biggest con

03:31.528 --> 03:34.094
since Ulysses jumped
out of a wooden horse.

03:34.096 --> 03:37.130
Tom Chandler, on my yacht, in my house.

03:37.132 --> 03:38.787
And you two let it happen.

03:38.790 --> 03:42.335
I was that close to that guy.

03:42.337 --> 03:43.603
I was that close.

03:43.605 --> 03:45.205
He could've recognized me.

03:45.207 --> 03:46.940
I didn't know it was Tom Chandler.

03:46.942 --> 03:49.509
I-I thought he was just a fisherman.

03:49.511 --> 03:53.847
What did you say?
What did you say to me?

03:53.849 --> 03:56.149
Hmm? What did you say to me?

03:56.151 --> 03:58.931
I thought he was just a fisherman.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.887
A fisherman. You thought.

04:00.889 --> 04:03.156
God, Giorgio, we are in the midst

04:03.158 --> 04:06.459
of a tectonic shift of a
paradigm of human behavior.

04:06.461 --> 04:09.462
Now is not the time for you to think.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.826
We sealed off the ports.

04:13.829 --> 04:16.341
He can't have gone far.
Not with just a few men.

04:16.345 --> 04:17.435
It wasn't just a few men.

04:17.439 --> 04:19.839
He was working for the U.S. Navy
and the British Intelligence.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.440
- You don't know that.
- Omar told us.

04:21.442 --> 04:23.402
He was stalling you until
his team could arrive.

04:23.405 --> 04:25.172
- I was doing my job.
- Giorgio, that's why he tricked you

04:25.174 --> 04:26.880
- into getting the seeds!
- At least I kept my clothes on!

04:26.882 --> 04:29.449
Shut up! Listen!

04:34.456 --> 04:35.989
Okay.

04:35.991 --> 04:38.391
Okay.

04:38.393 --> 04:42.862
Giorgio, you will get your
mongrels out onto the street

04:42.864 --> 04:46.326
and you will bring me seeds,
or you will bring me hostages.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.381
- Clear?
- Yes.

04:47.384 --> 04:49.368
Lucia, darling, there
is a U.S. Navy ship

04:49.371 --> 04:50.990
out there somewhere. I don't know where.

04:50.993 --> 04:52.577
But you will find it
and you will sink it

04:52.579 --> 04:54.673
to the bottom of the
great sea. Understood?

04:54.676 --> 04:58.751
Those seeds do not leave
this godforsaken island.

05:02.493 --> 05:05.220
He hurt you. Didn't he?

05:11.009 --> 05:12.499
Yes.

05:16.765 --> 05:19.265
And now there's a great storm

05:19.267 --> 05:21.801
- welling up inside you, right?
- Yes.

05:21.803 --> 05:23.670
- You're angry.
- Yes, Father.

05:23.672 --> 05:25.605
And how does anger feel?

05:28.176 --> 05:29.976
It feels terrible.

05:29.978 --> 05:32.579
So put it to good use.

05:34.973 --> 05:37.183
Won't be long now.

05:40.222 --> 05:43.856
Set up more checkpoints,
break down doors,

05:43.858 --> 05:46.088
whatever it takes.

05:46.091 --> 05:49.395
- I want my money.
- And I want my seeds.

05:49.397 --> 05:51.164
You were working with the Americans.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.499
I was set up. We all were.

05:53.501 --> 05:55.969
If you kill me,

05:55.971 --> 05:58.338
- you get nothing.
- Double.

05:58.340 --> 06:02.508
What? I will help you find
the seeds, you pay me double.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.744
Fine.

06:04.746 --> 06:08.320
We started on the east
side. You take the west.

06:16.858 --> 06:18.791
Been in Italy all this time?

06:18.793 --> 06:20.326
Greece.

06:20.328 --> 06:22.466
Leave the Navy, see the world?

06:22.469 --> 06:24.864
Something like that.

06:24.866 --> 06:27.033
Rally point Alpha is up ahead.

06:27.035 --> 06:29.369
Miller, Green, you
approach from the south.

06:29.371 --> 06:32.005
- We'll take it from the east.
- Copy that.

06:35.143 --> 06:37.877
So what are we supposed to call him now?

06:37.879 --> 06:41.948
"Hey, Tom"? "Mr. Chandler"?

06:41.950 --> 06:44.083
I'd stick with "Captain."

06:44.085 --> 06:45.430
Right.

06:46.921 --> 06:48.554
Sunshine, what's your whiskey?

06:48.556 --> 06:51.257
30 seconds from rally Alpha.

06:51.259 --> 06:53.393
Local search came up empty.

06:53.395 --> 06:55.395
Copy that.

07:00.156 --> 07:02.690
Our intel said the buyer
had the know-how and the labs

07:02.693 --> 07:04.685
to fight the plant virus.

07:04.688 --> 07:06.054
You were with him.

07:06.057 --> 07:09.409
Giorgio's a thug, but
he answers to somebody.

07:09.411 --> 07:12.211
The woman he was with at the Coliseum?

07:12.213 --> 07:14.047
The one watching you fight?

07:16.184 --> 07:17.684
His sister.

07:33.501 --> 07:36.569
- Green, any sign of the CO?
- Negative.

07:38.940 --> 07:41.007
Sunshine, we have a visual on you.

07:41.009 --> 07:42.775
No sign of Charlie Oscar.

07:42.777 --> 07:44.410
Nothing from up here either.

07:44.412 --> 07:46.979
I'll put her down and...

07:46.981 --> 07:48.781
Contact, three o'clock!

07:48.783 --> 07:52.752
Hold your fire!

07:59.494 --> 08:02.495
Too many! Too many! Do not engage!

08:11.106 --> 08:12.605
It's too hot!

08:12.607 --> 08:15.123
Mother, we're taking heavy
fire. We gotta get outta here!

08:15.126 --> 08:16.415
Should we engage?

08:16.418 --> 08:18.686
Rally point is blown.
Mike'll go for Bravo.

08:22.050 --> 08:23.649
Negative, Green. Abort.

08:23.651 --> 08:26.819
Too many hostiles and no sign of
the CO. Scram rally point Alpha.

08:26.821 --> 08:28.821
Copy that. Moving to rally point Bravo.

08:28.823 --> 08:30.824
Hang on!

08:33.187 --> 08:34.785
Let's go.

08:36.635 --> 08:38.735
Copy that, Sunshine. Scram point Alpha.

08:38.738 --> 08:41.355
Widen your aerial search
and proceed to Bravo.

09:03.425 --> 09:05.858
Cobra team, Alpha's blown.
Request SITREP Bravo.

09:05.860 --> 09:09.829
All quiet here. No sign of hostiles.

09:09.831 --> 09:13.183
No sign of the CO either.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.233
- Mike has to be hurt or pinned down.
- I know.

09:15.236 --> 09:16.636
We need to do a full grid search,

09:16.638 --> 09:19.038
- go street by street...
- Tom, I know. I've got it.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.091
All teams, this is Vulture.
We need to sweep the area.

09:22.094 --> 09:23.476
Burk, stay at Bravo with the RHIB.

09:23.478 --> 09:25.678
If the CO turns up, get
him the hell out of there.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.480
Everyone else, we need to circle out

09:27.482 --> 09:29.549
from each rally point
and start the grid search.

09:29.551 --> 09:31.350
Fletcher, Chandler, and I
will work from the north.

09:31.352 --> 09:32.988
Miller, Green, start from the south.

09:32.991 --> 09:34.654
Talk to the locals, go door-to-door,

09:34.656 --> 09:36.656
do whatever you have to, but find him.

09:36.658 --> 09:39.358
Be advised, hostiles
are doing the same thing.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.693
Cobra copies.

09:40.695 --> 09:43.196
- Captain Chandler?
- You heard right.

09:45.733 --> 09:48.401
Just can't help yourself, can you?

09:48.403 --> 09:50.895
Old habits. Glad to
see you still have 'em.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.941
It's okay.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.677
- No, no, no, no, no. No.
- No.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.382
I have to go. I have to go.

11:44.035 --> 11:45.199
Si?

11:48.072 --> 11:49.738
Si.

11:49.741 --> 11:51.474
Thank you.

12:21.808 --> 12:24.275
- Your son?
- Si.

12:25.566 --> 12:26.913
_

12:27.497 --> 12:28.831
_

12:32.931 --> 12:34.939
I've lost family, too.

12:37.032 --> 12:38.832
I'm sorry.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.363
This smell... What is this?

12:47.874 --> 12:49.569
Nostos.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.332
Grazie.

13:11.268 --> 13:14.334
He says he has not seen
an American here in months.

13:14.337 --> 13:17.128
You believe him? Not a word.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.469
Hold on, hold on.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.672
Looks like Omar's guys
and the new assholes.

13:28.674 --> 13:31.308
Well, aren't they just
one big happy family?

13:35.016 --> 13:37.250
No one will talk. They're too scared.

13:37.253 --> 13:39.753
Giorgio has a lot of
influence in this region.

13:39.756 --> 13:40.795
The longer this takes,

13:40.798 --> 13:43.120
the more time they have
to find the Captain and us.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.599
So we level the playing field.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.506
No. No, no, no, no.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.412
Go. Go, go. Vai, vai!

14:49.221 --> 14:50.390
_

14:53.140 --> 14:54.535
_

14:55.094 --> 14:56.562
_

14:57.648 --> 14:58.691
_

14:58.856 --> 14:59.690
_

15:00.817 --> 15:02.347
_

15:02.910 --> 15:05.279
_

15:07.375 --> 15:09.555
_

15:59.703 --> 16:02.993
I didn't know a staycation
could be so much fun.

16:04.906 --> 16:07.891
We should send the kids
to Grandma's more often.

16:42.785 --> 16:46.254
TAO! EW detecting a new radar
emission at bearing 085 true,

16:46.257 --> 16:47.990
moving south-southwest.

16:47.993 --> 16:50.594
It's rounding the tip of
the island. What is it?

16:50.597 --> 16:52.722
Analyzing radar band and frequency, sir.

16:52.725 --> 16:55.392
We've got an X-band radar signal.
Plugging it into the library now.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.645
SSES has indication of an
EHF transmission signal.

16:57.648 --> 16:58.735
Aye, ma'am.

16:58.738 --> 17:01.356
Based on the parameters,
I've identified contact

17:01.359 --> 17:04.851
as a... Hellenic Navy vessel...

17:04.854 --> 17:06.277
Hydra Class.

17:06.279 --> 17:08.146
- A Greek warship?
- That's no coincidence.

17:08.147 --> 17:10.882
Is it possible the Greeks
are behind this whole thing?

17:10.884 --> 17:13.751
Let's not jump to conclusions. Not
long ago, we were all part of NATO.

17:13.752 --> 17:15.353
Which means they know our battle plans.

17:15.355 --> 17:17.188
EW, any signs of hostile intent?

17:17.190 --> 17:19.082
No, ma'am, so far, no
aggressive maneuvering.

17:19.085 --> 17:20.724
And fire control is not engaged.

17:20.727 --> 17:23.094
Gator, how protected are
we along this coastline?

17:23.096 --> 17:24.954
Well, sir, as long as
we stay close to land,

17:24.957 --> 17:28.566
they shouldn't be able to
distinguish us from the rocks, sir.

17:28.568 --> 17:31.135
- Set EMCON Condition Alpha.
- Aye, sir.

17:31.137 --> 17:35.039
This is your TAO. Set
EMCON Condition Alpha.

17:35.041 --> 17:36.950
And get eyes on the
horizon for that ship.

17:36.953 --> 17:38.810
Yes, sir.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.343
Hydra Class.

17:57.230 --> 17:58.997
Stavros.

17:58.999 --> 18:02.233
- Where's Giorgio?
- Do I look like Giorgio to you?

18:03.603 --> 18:04.947
Where are we?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.866
Almost to Nora Pula, Ms. Lucia.

18:08.869 --> 18:11.009
And the U.S. Navy ship?

18:11.011 --> 18:13.411
If it's out there, we haven't seen it.

18:13.413 --> 18:16.648
It's out there. I can feel it.

18:16.650 --> 18:19.684
Keep looking.

18:25.963 --> 18:27.925
- Can you make out what they're saying?
- No.

18:27.927 --> 18:29.627
Well, wait, wait, wait.

18:31.464 --> 18:33.598
Something's happened.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.401
- American...
- You speak Greek now?

18:38.171 --> 18:39.804
At a house a few blocks from here.

18:39.806 --> 18:43.041
That's gotta be Mike.

18:49.650 --> 18:52.551
Jesus.

18:58.525 --> 19:01.793
Did you at least get something
from her before you...

19:01.795 --> 19:05.096
He's close.

19:05.098 --> 19:06.698
And he's hurt.

19:18.378 --> 19:20.878
Mikey.

19:23.683 --> 19:26.317
Mikey.

19:45.305 --> 19:47.605
Copy that, Nathan James.

19:47.607 --> 19:51.309
There's a Greek warship
approaching the island.

19:51.311 --> 19:53.611
Stavros.

19:53.613 --> 19:56.532
He came by Giorgio's house.

20:01.921 --> 20:03.354
Got something.

20:06.593 --> 20:08.259
The CO's injured.

20:08.261 --> 20:10.228
Looks like she was trying to help him.

20:10.230 --> 20:12.130
And he's been drugged.

20:12.132 --> 20:13.765
How do you know?

20:13.767 --> 20:15.967
I've seen this before.

20:15.969 --> 20:19.303
Mike won't make it
far in this condition.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.147
Let's move.

20:43.596 --> 20:45.429
Okay, open your eyes.

20:48.387 --> 20:51.169
I'm a warrior princess, Daddy.

21:28.275 --> 21:30.341
Hey, Dad!

21:30.343 --> 21:32.320
Dad!

21:32.478 --> 21:34.111
Dad!

21:44.791 --> 21:47.391
I made this for you, Dad.

21:54.467 --> 21:58.169
It's a Navy SEAL.

21:59.639 --> 22:02.607
It says, "For my dad."

22:02.609 --> 22:07.812
This is the Navy SEALs.

22:07.814 --> 22:09.513
His name is...

22:09.515 --> 22:14.218
And he likes to...

22:14.220 --> 22:18.189
And he has a lot of friends...

22:18.191 --> 22:21.225
I think he's really
cool. Do you like it?

22:28.327 --> 22:29.972
Do you like it, Dad?

22:34.173 --> 22:37.275
You're a commander.

22:38.811 --> 22:40.845
I love it, pal.

23:01.601 --> 23:04.402
How's it look?

23:05.872 --> 23:07.538
Molto brutto.

23:07.540 --> 23:10.541
So the latest genetic
modification didn't work.

23:10.543 --> 23:13.010
We need the code. We need those seeds.

23:13.012 --> 23:15.146
We'll get the seeds.

23:15.148 --> 23:19.358
Listen, Dad, the other research,
I've been reading it over.

23:19.361 --> 23:21.418
- And?
- It's gonna work.

23:21.421 --> 23:23.288
You think so?

23:23.291 --> 23:25.423
The other subjects... They
all had the same result.

23:25.425 --> 23:29.226
No side effects, no hindrance
of other normal brain function.

23:29.228 --> 23:31.595
- We're gonna do this.
- That's what I've been saying.

23:31.597 --> 23:33.616
- My boy.
- They're gonna get those seeds.

23:33.619 --> 23:35.066
They're gonna get 'em, Dad.

23:35.068 --> 23:37.868
And then, we'll finish
this. We're so close.

23:57.790 --> 23:59.790
Master Chief?

24:03.730 --> 24:06.197
Looks like someone's
trying to get our attention.

24:06.199 --> 24:08.432
Let's take a closer look.

24:16.668 --> 24:18.601
It's definitely a signal mirror.

24:18.604 --> 24:22.546
Long, short, long, short.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.647
Morse code.

24:23.649 --> 24:26.650
Long, long, long. Now
it's starting over.

24:26.652 --> 24:28.285
Charlie Oscar.

24:28.287 --> 24:31.455
- Charlie Oscar. Do you see him?
- No.

24:31.457 --> 24:35.292
But I do see where the
signal is coming from.

24:35.294 --> 24:37.361
The top of that cathedral.

24:41.011 --> 24:42.767
All teams, be advised.

24:42.770 --> 24:44.469
We have Charlie Oscar's location.

24:44.472 --> 24:46.572
He's at the cathedral.

24:46.575 --> 24:48.505
Copy that.

24:48.635 --> 24:50.408
Copy that.

24:52.045 --> 24:53.677
We see it.

24:53.679 --> 24:55.011
He found high ground.

24:55.014 --> 24:56.721
Let's go get him.

25:04.907 --> 25:06.774
Mother, this is Sunshine.

25:06.776 --> 25:09.643
We are 6 mikes out, heading
to high ground for exfil.

25:09.645 --> 25:11.912
Copy, Sunshine. Vulture,
what's your whiskey?

25:11.915 --> 25:14.483
Vulture team is
approaching the cathedral.

25:17.553 --> 25:20.537
Miller, Green, you're with us. Burk.

25:26.629 --> 25:27.862
Move.

25:32.635 --> 25:35.536
Aah!

25:35.538 --> 25:37.404
Aah!

26:07.970 --> 26:09.403
Aah!

26:31.162 --> 26:33.763
Go, go, go! Inside! Inside!

26:38.192 --> 26:39.923
Staircase in back.

26:44.814 --> 26:46.880
Sunshine, we need...

26:56.240 --> 26:57.773
Aah!

27:12.606 --> 27:16.076
Don't worry. They're
trapped. I'll get my seeds.

27:22.462 --> 27:24.631
And I'll keep my money.

27:24.634 --> 27:27.046
Giorgio, where are you?

27:27.049 --> 27:30.417
We got them. They're
on the cathedral roof.

27:30.419 --> 27:32.119
Look for their helicopter.

27:32.121 --> 27:33.754
Ugh.

27:40.329 --> 27:42.120
I've got something.

27:42.123 --> 27:44.237
What is it? Moving quickly, staying low.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.867
TAO, EW detecting
active fire control radar

27:46.869 --> 27:49.036
from the Greek warship, track 4-6-2-7!

27:49.038 --> 27:51.372
All stations. Stand by
to intercept if they fire.

27:51.374 --> 27:52.606
Prepare countermeasures.

27:52.608 --> 27:54.208
Aye, prepare countermeasures.

27:54.210 --> 27:55.576
Sir?

27:55.578 --> 27:57.578
They're not aiming for us.

27:59.849 --> 28:01.749
Nathan James, we're being painted.

28:01.751 --> 28:04.255
- Attempting to evade.
- Do not let it touch down.

28:04.258 --> 28:07.092
If those seeds get on board, we're done.

28:07.095 --> 28:08.528
Yes, Lucia.

28:14.797 --> 28:16.597
Move!

28:16.599 --> 28:20.501
Calculating fire solutions now.

28:23.039 --> 28:24.305
Kill them.

28:24.307 --> 28:26.573
Damn it, they've still got us.

28:26.575 --> 28:28.609
Hang on, Nolan.

28:37.026 --> 28:38.292
- Damn it.
- Where did they go?

28:38.295 --> 28:39.761
I don't know.

28:47.263 --> 28:50.264
- Nice trick, Warrant.
- Mother, we shook 'em for now,

28:50.266 --> 28:52.266
but I'm gonna have to stick
out my neck to get up there.

28:52.268 --> 28:54.001
He'll need at least 30
seconds to clearance.

28:54.003 --> 28:55.271
Recommend we engage the Greek ship.

28:55.273 --> 28:56.573
- We know where she is...
- Negative.

28:56.575 --> 28:58.009
Right now we're hiding in plain sight.

28:58.011 --> 28:59.873
The moment we fire,
they'll be able to see us.

28:59.875 --> 29:01.508
If they get one lucky shot on us,

29:01.510 --> 29:03.577
Vulture team will be
stranded along with the seeds.

29:03.579 --> 29:06.447
What if they saw two of us, sir?

29:10.252 --> 29:12.405
It's not quite what it was designed for,

29:12.408 --> 29:13.908
but I think it'll work.

29:13.911 --> 29:15.410
Ready Nulka.

29:15.413 --> 29:18.434
- Gator, find me a new hiding spot.
- Yes, sir.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.207
Stand by to exfil to my command.

29:23.210 --> 29:24.909
Copy that. Nolan?

29:24.912 --> 29:26.254
Ready.

29:30.596 --> 29:32.195
Mike!

29:35.669 --> 29:37.269
Mike!

29:39.358 --> 29:40.958
Mike?

29:40.961 --> 29:42.615
It is Mike, right?

29:42.618 --> 29:44.017
Tom Chandler. Nice to meet you.

29:44.019 --> 29:46.487
Same here. Hell of a ship you got here.

29:46.489 --> 29:48.109
I got lucky.

30:01.771 --> 30:04.405
***

30:06.342 --> 30:08.375
How does it feel?

30:08.377 --> 30:12.079
I think I'm gonna like this view.

30:13.844 --> 30:15.777
You like Cubans?

30:20.189 --> 30:22.899
I can hear 'em coming. Hurry it up.

30:22.902 --> 30:24.167
Almost there.

30:27.742 --> 30:30.275
Charge set. Here you go, Fletcher.

30:33.870 --> 30:36.170
Okay, everyone take cover.

30:44.471 --> 30:47.472
Is he okay? Is he hit?

30:47.483 --> 30:49.917
Let's go, Nathan James,
where's that helo?

30:49.919 --> 30:51.919
It's now or never, Sunshine!

30:53.289 --> 30:57.191
Sunshine, stand by to
exfil on my command.

30:57.193 --> 30:59.660
- Nulka ready?
- Yes, ESSM ready to fire.

30:59.662 --> 31:02.362
- Gator, are we in position?
- Yes, sir. We can make it.

31:02.364 --> 31:05.866
- Sunshine, go for exfil.
- Roger that.

31:09.283 --> 31:11.449
Here we go!

31:20.249 --> 31:22.258
There you are.

31:22.261 --> 31:24.551
We have a target.

31:24.553 --> 31:26.019
Fire.

31:29.124 --> 31:31.358
SAM inbound to helo, bearing 087!

31:31.360 --> 31:33.560
Air, kill track, 48276 with birds.

31:33.563 --> 31:36.490
Aye, killing track 48276 with birds.

31:50.711 --> 31:53.213
Damn it!

31:53.215 --> 31:55.849
- Battle damage assessment?
- Missile splashed.

31:55.851 --> 31:57.885
Ah.

31:57.887 --> 32:00.654
But we have the U.S. Navy ship.

32:00.656 --> 32:01.855
Prepare to fire.

32:09.326 --> 32:10.525
I have the ship.

32:10.527 --> 32:12.213
Target solution confirmed.

32:12.216 --> 32:14.496
- They see us now.
- X-band radar detected,

32:14.498 --> 32:16.598
down bearing line 0-9-0 true!

32:16.600 --> 32:18.266
Let's give that ship a bigger target.

32:18.268 --> 32:19.501
Stand by for Nulka!

32:19.503 --> 32:21.403
Fire!

32:26.410 --> 32:28.009
Bulldog inbound, bearing 090!

32:28.011 --> 32:33.014
Heads up track 23345, deploy
Nulka countermeasures now!

32:33.016 --> 32:34.583
Nulka away.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.006
_

32:58.008 --> 33:00.763
- Did we hit it?
- It's like we fired at a ghost.

33:04.815 --> 33:06.381
Missile splashed.

33:06.383 --> 33:10.385
Nulka was successful.

33:10.387 --> 33:12.053
Gator?

33:12.055 --> 33:16.558
We made it to the inlet,
sir. That ship can't see us.

33:20.130 --> 33:22.456
Door won't hold for long!

33:22.459 --> 33:26.635
When the door blows, I'll
aim low, and you aim high.

33:26.637 --> 33:29.803
Stay down, Mike. Stay down!

33:38.482 --> 33:40.549
Mike.

33:42.586 --> 33:44.386
Meant to give you this.

33:46.189 --> 33:47.956
Spear of the Navy, huh?

33:47.958 --> 33:49.391
Damn right.

33:55.154 --> 33:57.688
A last minute FRAGO.

33:57.691 --> 34:00.702
They want us to escort some
scientist to the Arctic.

34:00.704 --> 34:03.087
Quick deployment just for the summer.

34:03.090 --> 34:05.674
Yeah, but it's summer for the kids.

34:05.676 --> 34:08.577
No camping trips, no fishing, no Dad.

34:08.579 --> 34:11.413
- You tell them yet?
- Tonight.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.551
Lucas...

34:17.821 --> 34:19.420
Lucas!

34:19.587 --> 34:21.222
Lucas!

34:25.329 --> 34:27.495
Can't wait on that helo,
Fletcher. Let her go!

34:27.496 --> 34:28.730
10-inch steel!

34:49.853 --> 34:51.652
Lucas!

34:53.190 --> 34:55.290
Where are you, buddy?!

35:45.142 --> 35:47.024
Lucas.

35:47.210 --> 35:48.710
Lucas.

35:48.712 --> 35:52.468
Hey, Lucas, hey. I
know it's a few months,

35:52.471 --> 35:53.803
and that's a long time,

35:53.806 --> 35:57.218
but I'll still read
your bedtime stories.

35:57.220 --> 35:58.820
How?

35:58.822 --> 36:01.173
I'll make recordings before I deploy.

36:01.176 --> 36:03.074
You can play a chapter every night.

36:04.994 --> 36:08.929
Well, maybe I could record
something for you, too.

36:08.932 --> 36:10.532
Yeah.

36:10.534 --> 36:12.233
Yeah, I'd love that.

36:14.947 --> 36:16.438
Okay.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.906
Let's get you down.

36:17.908 --> 36:20.141
All you gotta do is jump,
buddy. I'll catch ya.

36:26.983 --> 36:29.436
That's your ride, Mike!

36:32.222 --> 36:34.960
Come on, son. Now's the time.

36:34.963 --> 36:38.359
I'll catch you. I promise.

36:45.402 --> 36:46.701
Oh!

36:48.238 --> 36:50.271
Easy, Mike.

36:50.273 --> 36:53.362
We got the seeds. You can let go now!

37:01.551 --> 37:03.384
I wanna go back.

37:03.546 --> 37:06.250
I wanna go back.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.140
The Americans won't get far.

37:24.143 --> 37:27.013
They have no allies in
the Med. They're all alone.

37:27.015 --> 37:29.081
Apparently, they're
doing just fine that way.

37:29.083 --> 37:30.950
I couldn't shoot down
the helicopter, Father,

37:30.952 --> 37:32.518
not with those seeds on board.

37:32.520 --> 37:35.821
Those seeds should not have
been on board to begin with.

37:35.823 --> 37:37.757
Listen, Dad, we know you're upset...

37:37.759 --> 37:39.792
Upset? Upset?

37:39.794 --> 37:42.061
I don't even know what upset means.

37:42.063 --> 37:44.564
I'm distraught, I'm
frustrated, I'm disappointed,

37:44.566 --> 37:47.767
I'm... I'm disillusioned.

37:47.769 --> 37:50.069
I coddled you two.

37:50.071 --> 37:51.938
I gave you everything, everything...

37:51.940 --> 37:54.774
Money, power, trust, an entire
military at your disposal.

37:54.776 --> 37:56.409
What am I supposed to do now?

37:56.411 --> 37:58.578
What am I to do?

Even if we find that ship,

38:00.548 --> 38:03.195

38:04.867 --> 38:06.852
Impotent!

38:08.022 --> 38:11.424

isn't the only answer.

38:11.426 --> 38:13.086
- Dad, look, I...

38:17.231 --> 38:19.765
