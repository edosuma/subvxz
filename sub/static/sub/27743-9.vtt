00:58.683 --> 01:01.186
[Maelstrom] So, do tell us, Dr. Bellum,

01:01.770 --> 01:05.356
who in the world is this Chase Devineaux?

01:05.607 --> 01:08.068
[Bellum]
Formerly an inspector of Interpol.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.488
Any current assignment
is completely unknown.

01:11.780 --> 01:16.284
Devineaux was quietly transferred
from his department in Poitiers, France,

01:16.367 --> 01:17.994
nearly six months ago.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.287
Poitiers?

01:19.579 --> 01:21.414

01:22.040 --> 01:27.462
[Maelstrom] <i>The very residence looted</i>

01:28.338 --> 01:29.839
Coincidence?

01:30.632 --> 01:32.342
Devineaux was there that night.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.012
[Brunt] <i>Black Sheep delivered Crackle</i>

01:38.681 --> 01:42.644
[Cleo]<i> This Devineaux also barged into</i>
<i>my Swiss chateau during a dinner party,</i>

01:42.727 --> 01:46.272

<i>Carmen Sandiego to make her escape</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:49.567

01:50.068 --> 01:54.322
<i>And to think I had suspected</i>
<i>the charming duke of being her inside man.</i>

01:54.864 --> 01:57.575
Then it seems that we have
discerned a pattern,

01:57.659 --> 02:02.038
one which explains how Carmen Sandiego
has repeatedly foiled our plans

02:02.122 --> 02:04.332
with such a high rate of success.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.918
She isn't working alone.

02:07.585 --> 02:11.506
Sounds to me like we have ourselves
a plan B, as in "bait."

02:12.215 --> 02:13.633
Catch Chase Devineaux,

02:13.716 --> 02:17.303
and we finally catch
the elusive Carmen Sandiego.

02:17.762 --> 02:20.557
We'll put Paper Star on the case.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.184
She led us to ACME, after all.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.812
This is not child's play.

02:25.895 --> 02:29.440
We do not know if Black Sheep
has partnered with a rogue policeman

02:29.524 --> 02:31.818
or a high-level law enforcement agency.

02:32.235 --> 02:36.197
Then whom would you suggest we send,
Shadowsan?

02:37.240 --> 02:38.366

You did not do it alone, eh?

03:49.020 --> 03:51.689
Of course not.
You are my partner.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.483
Do not be coy, Ms. Argent!

03:53.566 --> 03:57.070

to <i>La Femme Rouge</i>, your silent partner.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.029
And?

03:58.196 --> 03:59.530
What if I was?

03:59.614 --> 04:02.575
Carmen Sandiego
left the Magna Cartas on my train seat,

04:02.659 --> 04:04.494
presumably for me to find.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.829
She returned stolen Vermeers to museums

04:06.913 --> 04:09.999
and ten-million-dollar postage stamps
to children's charities.

04:10.166 --> 04:14.128
Stealing things only to return them
makes absolutely no sense.

04:14.254 --> 04:19.217
I agree, which is why I do not believe
she's stealing these things to begin with.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.427
So, would she be returning stolen things

04:21.511 --> 04:23.680
to show that she can do my job
better than me?

04:23.763 --> 04:27.517
Simply to make me look like
some sort of law enforcement imbecile?

04:27.892 --> 04:29.811
Why must it always be about you?

04:29.936 --> 04:33.940
Maybe you should be the one to tell me
since you are clearly Chief's favorite.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.484
Ugh! You are impossible!

04:36.567 --> 04:39.904
Have you forgotten to factor VILE

You mean the non-existent entity

04:42.740 --> 04:46.160

exists for 20 years?

04:46.327 --> 04:50.290
At least I have seen Carmen Sandiego
with my own two eyes.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.125
And she's out there somewhere,

04:52.208 --> 04:55.795

at this very moment.

[Player] It's been a while
since you snatched it from VILE.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.379
We've pretty much combed through
every last bit on data on here, Red.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.257
You may need to sneak back
to the Isle of VILE

the field trip is necessary, Shadowsan?

06:03.488 --> 06:06.365
We have an army of operatives
to choose from.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.161
Our Carmen Sandiego problem
must be tied off decisively,

06:10.244 --> 06:11.537

06:12.121 --> 06:16.209
It is time that she contend
with one of our own in the field.

I agree with Shadowsan 100 percent.

06:20.838 --> 06:23.800

06:25.093 --> 06:26.928
Absolutely not.

06:27.011 --> 06:30.264
The coach is too soft
towards her dear Black Sheep.

06:30.723 --> 06:34.185
At one time, that statement
might have been accurate.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.231
But after she went and betrayed
the only family she knew,

06:38.815 --> 06:40.691
Black Sheep is dead to me.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.028

14:32.162 --> 14:35.207
and never enter a room
without an exit plan.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.919
[grunting]

14:40.421 --> 14:41.338
[grunts]

14:52.224 --> 14:53.225
[groans]

15:03.152 --> 15:06.113
[both grunting]

15:11.660 --> 15:12.494
[grunts]

15:13.787 --> 15:14.622
[bones cracking]

15:18.167 --> 15:19.084
[gasps]

15:24.506 --> 15:27.927
I know how much you wanted
to get out and see the world, pumpkin,

15:28.010 --> 15:30.846
but trust me, it's a world of hurt.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.225
[sirens wailing]

15:36.018 --> 15:37.645
Oh, man, oh, man.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.859
[gasping] Huh?

15:46.028 --> 15:48.948
Come on, Red, you just need
to buy yourself a little more time.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.157
Backup's on the way.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.035
You rescued me from the side of a road,

15:53.118 --> 15:56.705
only to lure me here
so you can pound me into dust?

15:57.081 --> 16:03.420
[laughs] Believe you me, Lambkins,
that is one stone you do not want to turn.

16:04.088 --> 16:08.342
But I promise to let bygones be bygones
if you be a good little sheep

16:08.425 --> 16:11.095
and come back to the island
with the rest of the flock.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.137
[gasps]

16:12.554 --> 16:14.431
Then you better pound harder

16:14.723 --> 16:17.476
because I am never going back
to VILE Island.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.313
After every little thing
we've ever done for you.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.149
Come here, little cub.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.277
-[bones cracking]
-[Carmen groaning]

16:28.362 --> 16:33.200
Let mama bear give you
one great, big last hug goodbye.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.452
-[bones crunching]
-[groans, gasps]

16:38.580 --> 16:39.415

-[grunts]

16:39.748 --> 16:40.582
[gasps]

16:50.300 --> 16:51.760
Still infighting, huh?

16:52.386 --> 16:54.054
Well, I wasn't going back with Coach

16:54.138 --> 16:55.931
and I'm definitely
not going back with you.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.605
I did not come here to take you back.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.690
[grunts]

17:04.857 --> 17:06.108
-[screams]
-[sword clangs]

17:06.275 --> 17:07.234
Carmen?

17:20.497 --> 17:21.373
I...

17:22.833 --> 17:23.959
I don't understand.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.879
Follow me now. No questions.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.465
-What?
-That is a question.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.468
[sirens wailing]

17:34.344 --> 17:36.055
The police will attend to him,

17:36.138 --> 17:39.141
and they will lock us up
if we are still here when they do.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.101
I'll take my chances with them, thank you.

17:41.268 --> 17:43.604
The police are the least of my concerns.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.815
Do you really not realize
that being trapped in a cell

17:46.899 --> 17:50.194
would far more easily
allow VILE to reach us?

17:50.486 --> 17:51.653
Reach <i>us</i>?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.739
Stubborn as always, Black Sheep.

17:54.114 --> 17:57.034
Can you not see
that we are in this together now?

17:58.077 --> 18:01.038
We've always been in this together,
haven't we?

18:01.997 --> 18:03.165
[groans]

18:06.877 --> 18:07.961
It was you.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.130
You were the one who found me.

18:10.756 --> 18:14.051
You are in no condition
to leave here on your own.

18:14.718 --> 18:15.719
Please.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.224
[police radio chattering]

18:24.103 --> 18:26.355
[dog barking]

18:27.147 --> 18:28.023
[groans]

18:30.109 --> 18:31.693
[sighs] Huh?

18:34.446 --> 18:35.531
Shadowsan?

18:38.033 --> 18:39.076
[metal clangs]

18:42.204 --> 18:44.248
Cleaners, is Shadowsan with you?

18:45.582 --> 18:47.793
I see. I'm gonna need pickup.

18:52.005 --> 18:52.840
[grunts]

18:55.425 --> 18:56.468
[groans]

18:57.594 --> 18:59.388
Does it hurt when you breathe in?

18:59.638 --> 19:02.516
Argentina.
Tell me everything, now.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.643
There is nothing more to tell.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.937
As strange as it may seem,

19:07.479 --> 19:12.484
even someone like me is incapable
of turning his back on an abandoned baby.

19:12.818 --> 19:16.655
If you were such a sensitive guy,
why have you been such a jerk to me?

19:16.864 --> 19:19.074
Unlike the other members of our faculty,

19:19.158 --> 19:22.619
I did not wish for you
to succeed in crime school...

19:23.537 --> 19:25.914
because I could not bear
the thought of you being faced

19:25.998 --> 19:28.750
with having to choose a path of evil.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.128
You knew I'd never accept,

19:32.171 --> 19:35.632
and you knew what they'd do to me
when I said no.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.179
You failed me
because you were trying to protect me.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.472
And?

19:43.390 --> 19:46.268
[sighs] Yes, the coat was empty.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.437
I knew it! [groans]

19:49.563 --> 19:51.565
And you were never anything less

19:51.648 --> 19:55.777
than the very finest pickpocket
in your class.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.488
I sent Tigress to San Francisco

19:58.572 --> 20:02.993
knowing you would enjoy
proving that to her all over again.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.789
So, why now? Why tonight?

20:07.956 --> 20:11.126
I feared VILE might finally succeed
in stopping you,

20:11.210 --> 20:15.339
so it once again
seemed the right time to intervene.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.340
Again?

20:16.423 --> 20:20.427
I was not trying to harm you on the night
of your escape from the island.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.349
<i>I was trying to join you.</i>

20:25.974 --> 20:28.435
I guess I scare easy
when I see a drawn sword.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.021
I felt it was a necessary ruse.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.649
<i>Though, did you not wonder</i>

20:33.774 --> 20:36.652
<i>why the Cleaners never pursued you</i>
<i>in the helicopter?</i>

20:38.487 --> 20:40.239
No way!

20:40.572 --> 20:44.243
A great burden was lifted from me
the night of your escape,

20:44.326 --> 20:48.455
believing that you would begin
a new life somewhere.

20:48.789 --> 20:53.585
I never fathomed that you would dedicate
your life to destroying VILE,

20:53.669 --> 20:56.880
which complicated things for me,
to say the least.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.761
[police radio chattering]

21:04.012 --> 21:06.640
[Julia] Agent Devineaux
is extremely disoriented.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.351
They won't know more until they run tests.

21:09.851 --> 21:13.939
<i>The lug didn't deserve</i>
<i>whatever Carmen Sandiego did to him.</i>

21:14.022 --> 21:16.900
But... how can you be certain
she was behind this?

21:17.776 --> 21:20.654
<i>The keycard. It all adds up.</i>

21:21.196 --> 21:22.739
<i>Devineaux didn't lose it.</i>

21:22.823 --> 21:26.159
<i>Carmen picked his pocket</i>
<i>and used it to bait him.</i>

21:26.243 --> 21:30.497
<i>Beyond that, I have to trust what I saw</i>
<i>with my own two eyes.</i>

21:30.622 --> 21:33.792
<i>Carmen Sandiego was in that room</i>
<i>with Devineaux tonight.</i>

21:35.002 --> 21:37.170
[Player] You went back to Poitiers
to rescue a detective

21:37.254 --> 21:39.589
and left with an evil VILE mastermind?

21:39.673 --> 21:43.385
The worst one, too!
What makes you think you can trust him?

21:43.468 --> 21:46.555
And what exactly was he doing
in Argentina 20 years ago anyway?

21:47.264 --> 21:48.849
That's exactly what I want to know.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.143
There's more to the story.
There has to be.

21:51.226 --> 21:54.563
And my only chance of finding out
will be to keep Shadowsan...

21:55.731 --> 21:56.940
close.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.735
[Player]<i> Let me guess,</i>
<i>ninja disappearing act?</i>

21:59.818 --> 22:01.111
Something like that.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.571
<i>I'm sorry, Red.</i>

22:02.946 --> 22:03.864
Don't be.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.827
-He left something behind.
-<i>What?</i>

22:12.122 --> 22:13.290
A present.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.126
Have Zack and Ivy meet me at rendezvous.

22:16.626 --> 22:19.421
I have a feeling
we're gonna have new capers to plot.

22:27.471 --> 22:30.724
