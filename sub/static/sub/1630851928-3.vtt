<i>I'm sending you this letter</i>
<i>through Paloma or Mónica.</i>

00:08.880 --> 00:12.080
<i>Do whatever they ask you to do.</i>
<i>I told them to ask this of you.</i>

00:12.160 --> 00:15.280
<i>I haven't rested for four years,</i>
<i>and I can't take it anymore.</i>

00:15.360 --> 00:17.560
<i>I have shown you</i>
<i>that I would never betray you,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.440
<i>but Marta has to be found.</i>

00:19.520 --> 00:22.840
<i>I've already told them where she is,</i>
<i>but they can't find her,</i>

00:22.920 --> 00:25.560
<i>and I can't confess</i>
<i>or I'll make things worse for you.</i>

00:25.640 --> 00:30.320
<i>So you have to help find her in secret.</i>
<i>If you don't help me,</i>

00:30.400 --> 00:34.040
<i>you'll leave me with no choice but to talk</i>
<i>to the judge and tell the whole story.</i>

00:34.120 --> 00:36.880
<i>I'm going to go crazy and this has to end.</i>

00:36.960 --> 00:39.080
<i>This will only end if Marta is found.</i>

00:39.160 --> 00:40.240
<i>All the best.</i>

00:40.320 --> 00:43.360
<i>I hope you come to your senses</i>
<i>and put an end to all of this.</i>

MIGUEL

00:52.520 --> 00:56.520
MARTA DEL CASTILLO CASANUEVA
JULY 19, 1991 - JANUARY 24, 2009.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.000
SEVILLE

01:00.080 --> 01:02.680
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

01:41.880 --> 01:46.520
"EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, TELL THE TRUTH
SO THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU LIE."

01:52.600 --> 01:57.000
MARCH 24, 2011

01:57.080 --> 01:57.960
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:58.040 --> 02:02.520
First of all,
after having received the news,

02:03.400 --> 02:05.520
I would like to thank the judge

02:05.600 --> 02:07.880
for having increased our pain

02:08.880 --> 02:11.600
and anger thanks to this injustice.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.440
We consider this sentence
to be very unfair.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.480
Killing seems to be
an easy thing to do here.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.040
And that has made me
lose all faith in justice,

02:25.120 --> 02:28.360
in courtroom justice.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.480
All I can hope for
is justice in prison time.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.720
<i>The verdict for "El Cuco"</i>
<i>leaves no one satisfied.</i>

02:36.800 --> 02:38.720
And when I say that no one is satisfied,

02:38.800 --> 02:41.520
I'm not only referring to Marta's family
or the prosecution,

02:41.600 --> 02:43.800
but also to the judge himself.

02:43.880 --> 02:48.120
<i>The magistrate, Alejandro Vian,</i>
<i>sympathizes with Marta's parents.</i>

02:48.200 --> 02:51.560
<i>As a father, as a good citizen,</i>
<i>he says that he understands them,</i>

02:51.640 --> 02:54.680
<i>but, as a judge, his job</i>
<i>is to comply with the law,</i>

02:54.760 --> 02:56.840
<i>and he says</i>
<i>that there is a lack of evidence</i>

02:56.920 --> 02:59.280
<i>proving rape and murder took place,</i>

02:59.360 --> 03:02.080
<i>in a case in which the body</i>
<i>has not been found.</i>

03:02.160 --> 03:04.120
Who or what has failed here?

COURTHOUSE

03:09.480 --> 03:13.320
<i>The judge has convicted him of concealment</i>
<i>but not murder and rape,</i>

03:13.400 --> 03:15.320
<i>as requested by the prosecution.</i>

03:15.400 --> 03:17.640
<i>The judge thought</i>
<i>there was insufficient evidence</i>

03:17.720 --> 03:20.120
<i>to convict him of murder and rape.</i>

03:20.200 --> 03:23.120
<i>The judge took into consideration</i>
<i>how the DNA traces of "El Cuco"</i>

03:23.200 --> 03:25.400
<i>only prove that he was</i>
<i>at the scene of the crime,</i>

03:25.480 --> 03:27.080
<i>but not that he participated in it.</i>

03:27.160 --> 03:29.480
<i>He could have even gone free</i>
<i>and without charges</i>

03:29.560 --> 03:32.040
<i>if the prosecution</i>
<i>hadn't asked at the last moment</i>

03:32.120 --> 03:34.240
<i>that unlawful concealment be considered,</i>

03:34.320 --> 03:36.880
<i>which is why a three-year sentence</i>
<i>was delivered.</i>

03:38.800 --> 03:41.200
<i>What this makes us think</i>
<i>is that this trial,</i>

03:41.280 --> 03:44.640
<i>which was always considered</i>
<i>a prelude to the next one...</i>

03:44.720 --> 03:48.400
<i>Well, now we know what result to expect,</i>
<i>can't we?</i>

COURTHOUSE

03:49.520 --> 03:50.520
OCTOBER 17, 2011

03:50.600 --> 03:54.320
The trial for the disappearance
and murder of Marta del Castillo begins.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.200
...the four adult defendants,

03:57.280 --> 03:59.040
the main one being Miguel Carcaño--

03:59.120 --> 04:01.200
Three years of uncertainties,

04:01.280 --> 04:03.640
of questions,
of contradictory confessions.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.240
<i>We're witnessing one of the cases</i>

04:05.320 --> 04:08.320
<i>that has shocked the Spanish</i>
<i>and Andalusian public the most.</i>

04:08.400 --> 04:11.680
<i>Twenty sessions in court,</i>
<i>90 witnesses, 14 experts,</i>

04:11.760 --> 04:13.520
<i>6,000 pages of summaries</i>

04:13.600 --> 04:16.280
<i>and 150 journalists</i>
<i>from 40 different media outlets,</i>

04:16.360 --> 04:20.440
in one of the most controversial
cases in recent times.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.840
Due to circumstances,
procedural circumstances,

04:23.920 --> 04:26.800
the enormous pain the family felt,

04:26.880 --> 04:32.360
the absolutely spectacular public interest
it produced,

04:32.440 --> 04:35.440
and for so many reasons,
it was very different to any other trial.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.440
So, it's difficult to make comparisons.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.840
It was the first time

04:39.920 --> 04:43.040
they had asked me if I wanted
a police escort when I went to court.

04:45.120 --> 04:50.760
<i>In fact, I do remember that some lawyers</i>
<i>were literally attacked with oranges.</i>

04:50.840 --> 04:54.640
He should say where Marta is!
Don't defend him.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.920
Hey, how are you? Do you feel hopeful?

04:57.000 --> 05:00.240
Well, we're cautious, okay?

05:00.320 --> 05:03.760
After the disappointing first trial,

05:03.840 --> 05:05.600
we were really worried,

05:05.680 --> 05:08.160
because even though
the police had assured us

05:08.240 --> 05:10.080
that the evidence incriminated him...

05:10.160 --> 05:11.200
MARTA'S FATHER

05:11.280 --> 05:13.360
...well, we didn't trust them anymore.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.840
Murderer!

05:15.920 --> 05:18.040
How do you intend to plead?

05:18.120 --> 05:21.360
-Son of a bitch!
-Samuel, how do you feel about the trial?

05:21.440 --> 05:24.920
<i>Three of the accused have arrived on foot</i>
<i>to the provincial court.</i>

05:25.000 --> 05:29.360
<i>The main defendant, Miguel Carcaño,</i>
<i>arrived from prison in a police van.</i>

05:29.440 --> 05:33.400
The focus is now on the judicial statement
provided by Miguel Carcaño,

05:33.480 --> 05:35.840
the confessed perpetrator of the crime.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.040
Let's find out which version
Miguel Carcaño will give.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.360
Miguel Carcaño has given

05:40.440 --> 05:43.240
more than ten statements
to the police and the court,

05:43.320 --> 05:45.600
and he's given
six different versions of his story.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.480
Listen to Marta del Castillo's
confessed murderer.

05:57.360 --> 06:01.720
Mr. Carcaño, please stand up
and sit in the chair in front of you.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.000
FOR MURDER, SEXUAL ASSAULT

06:06.080 --> 06:08.120
AND CRIMES AGAINST MORAL INTEGRITY

06:09.600 --> 06:11.040
When you are ready, Your Honor.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.320
Yes, with the permission of the court,
I'll proceed.

06:14.400 --> 06:20.680
Miguel, please take yourself
back to January 24th, 2009.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.120
Is it true you met up with Marta?

06:23.200 --> 06:24.680
-Yes.
-So, what happened?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.760
We were in the bedroom arguing

06:26.840 --> 06:32.600
because she wanted me
to leave the girl that I was with.

06:33.120 --> 06:37.520
What you are saying is that perhaps Marta
wanted to resume a relationship with you.

06:37.600 --> 06:41.400
Yes. We were gesticulating a lot.
Both of us were.

06:41.480 --> 06:45.760
Then, because I felt nervous,
or I don't know...

06:45.840 --> 06:48.400
I don't know what happened to me.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.040
The ashtray was there.
I picked it up and I hit her.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.520
She fell to the floor,
and that's when I got scared.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.840
I bent down,
and there was a bit of blood on her head.

06:58.920 --> 07:02.440
And did you check
to see if it was just a cut

07:02.520 --> 07:04.440
or if it was something else?

07:04.520 --> 07:08.640
I remembered there was
a blood pressure monitor in the bathroom

07:08.720 --> 07:10.320
that belonged to my mother,

07:10.400 --> 07:13.680
so I put it on her,
and she didn't have a pulse.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.960
NATIONAL POLICE CORPS

07:20.040 --> 07:21.920
And what else happened immediately after?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.800
I didn't know what to do,
and at that moment, the minor arrived.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.880
I told him to go call Samuel.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.400
At that moment, he didn't know
where his cell phone was,

07:31.480 --> 07:33.280
so he went outside to the phone booth.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.880
<i>How long was it before they arrived?</i>

07:36.960 --> 07:39.160
<i>The minor wasn't gone for long.</i>

07:39.240 --> 07:40.880
<i>Five minutes or so.</i>

07:40.960 --> 07:44.000
<i>And Samuel arrived</i>
<i>after about a quarter of an hour or so.</i>

07:44.080 --> 07:46.880
Did they say how they got there,
if they had arrived by car?

07:46.960 --> 07:48.240
Samuel arrived by car.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.040
But when did you see that car?

07:50.120 --> 07:52.800
When we took the body out of my house.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.560
How did you take the body out?

07:54.640 --> 07:57.840
We didn't... There wasn't a lot of blood,

07:57.920 --> 08:03.080
so we put her in the wheelchair
and took her straight to the car.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.880
<i>And where did you go?</i>

08:06.960 --> 08:11.240
I don't know. I went back home
and stayed there to clean my house.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.360
RECONSTRUCTION

08:17.080 --> 08:23.000
On March 16th of that year,
you gave a new statement.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.240
<i>Is it true that in that statement,</i>

08:25.760 --> 08:28.120
<i>you implicated the minor</i>

08:29.000 --> 08:30.640
<i>in Marta's death?</i>

08:30.720 --> 08:31.640
<i>Yes.</i>

08:31.720 --> 08:35.440
Why did you say that,

08:35.520 --> 08:39.320
considering it's absolutely contradictory
to what you have just told us here?

08:39.960 --> 08:43.280
The minor had accused my brother.
He had implicated him.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.840
And since he had accused my brother,

08:46.920 --> 08:51.360
I testified in order
to accuse him of more crimes.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.320
And that's when Javi
put the knife to my neck.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.840
<i>Did you make it all up?</i>

08:57.920 --> 08:59.800
<i>Everything related to the rape, yes.</i>

08:59.880 --> 09:02.320
-Was the knife also a fabrication?
-Yes.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.640
<i>Miguel, why have you given</i>
<i>so many different versions</i>

09:07.720 --> 09:10.200
<i>about where Marta's body is?</i>

09:10.280 --> 09:12.280
<i>Because I don't know where it is.</i>

09:13.000 --> 09:15.920
<i>Did you intend to kill Marta</i>
<i>when you hit her?</i>

09:16.000 --> 09:16.960
<i>No.</i>

09:18.320 --> 09:21.480
<i>I accept responsibility for hitting her,</i>

09:21.560 --> 09:25.840
but I did not
take the body away from my house.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.160
I don't know where it is.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.200
No further questions, Your Honor.

09:31.560 --> 09:35.600
Barely stirring, unfazed, and calm...

09:35.680 --> 09:38.240
this was Miguel Carcaño
on his first day of testifying

09:38.320 --> 09:40.080
in the Marta del Castillo trial.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.000
People are shocked and outraged,

09:43.080 --> 09:47.800
especially because of how calm he was
while he was developing a version

09:47.880 --> 09:51.040
that combines some of the versions
he has previously given,

09:51.120 --> 09:54.600
but this one could benefit him the most.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.360
But let's now reveal

09:56.440 --> 10:00.400
the exclusive interview we conducted with
Miguel Carcaño's lawyer. Let's listen.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.880
I requested negligent homicide.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.120
And I requested
a three-year prison sentence,

10:06.200 --> 10:12.800
because Marta's death was the result
of an argument and a single blow,

10:12.880 --> 10:16.640
an unfortunate blow to the head,
let's say, with an ashtray, by Miguel.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.920
<i>Yes, but Paloma, according</i>
<i>to your proposition of reckless homicide,</i>

10:20.000 --> 10:22.240
<i>when would Miguel Carcaño</i>
<i>be released from prison?</i>

10:22.320 --> 10:24.280
He would be released

10:24.360 --> 10:25.680
immediately.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.600
Disgusting! Pig!

10:40.800 --> 10:44.880
<i>Well, every time when I go to court</i>
<i>and people start yelling, I get mad,</i>

10:44.960 --> 10:47.920
<i>but, actually, I like it,</i>
<i>because I can say, "You assholes."</i>

10:48.000 --> 10:50.480
<i>It actually gives me more strength,</i>
<i>I say,</i>

10:50.560 --> 10:53.040
<i>"Really? I'm more stubborn</i>
<i>than you, you bastards."</i>

10:53.120 --> 10:56.000
<i>When the truth comes out,</i>
<i>people are going to be shocked.</i>

10:56.080 --> 10:58.520
<i>Many things have yet to come to light.</i>

10:59.560 --> 11:04.640
FOR CONCEALMENT
AND CRIMES AGAINST MORAL INTEGRITY

11:05.480 --> 11:09.920
Samuel, yesterday you had the opportunity
to listen to Miguel Carcaño's statement.

11:10.000 --> 11:10.840
Yes.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.640
Everything he said regarding
your involvement... Is that true or not?

11:14.720 --> 11:16.320
It's an absolute lie.

11:16.400 --> 11:20.280
Why did you say you were involved,
not once but twice?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.800
At the time of my arrest,

11:21.880 --> 11:25.960
I was told absolutely, step by step,
everything that I should say.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.800
And while they were grabbing my neck

11:28.880 --> 11:31.240
and hitting me in the face and chest,

11:31.320 --> 11:34.880
they were telling me
that either I incriminate myself

11:35.640 --> 11:37.880
or they would go after my parents

11:38.760 --> 11:40.960
and go after Estefanía,
my partner at the time.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.680
NAME: SAMUEL BENÍTEZ PÉREZ

11:42.760 --> 11:44.200
HIS TIME UNDER POLICE CUSTODY

11:44.280 --> 11:45.280
FEBRUARY 16

11:45.360 --> 11:48.440
WHILE IN POLICE CUSTODY,
HE WAS ASSAULTED BY OFFICERS

11:49.240 --> 11:51.760
<i>How many police officers were there?</i>
<i>Do you recall?</i>

11:51.840 --> 11:55.600
<i>-While Samuel was giving his statement?</i>
<i>-Before he made his statement.</i>

11:55.680 --> 12:00.040
Two colleagues brought him up
from the cell. I don't know who.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.120
Many of the defendants have spoken about
being coerced while being questioned.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.760
What's your opinion on this?

12:08.280 --> 12:09.200
Well...

12:09.280 --> 12:11.160
GOVERNMENT DELEGATE

12:11.240 --> 12:12.840
I don't know.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.600
But what I do know

12:14.680 --> 12:17.120
is that this accusation

12:17.680 --> 12:20.720
is made very often, in thousands of cases.

12:20.800 --> 12:25.920
Right away, "The police made me...
The police did this to me..."

12:26.000 --> 12:28.560
No. Evidence is evidence.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.320
<i>-What are your qualifications?</i>
<i>-I'm a prison health physician.</i>

12:33.400 --> 12:35.840
<i>Did you treat Samuel Benitez?</i>

12:36.800 --> 12:38.960
He had a bruise on his right arm.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.560
The skin beneath it
was slightly swollen, an edema.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.240
-Yes.
-And the bruise...

12:44.200 --> 12:46.720
MEDICAL REPORT FOR INJURIES:
SAMUEL BENÍTEZ PÉREZ

12:46.800 --> 12:49.840
TRAUMAS RELATED TO HIS ARREST

12:49.920 --> 12:52.560
SHOWING THE FOLLOWING INJURIES:
EDEMA AND HEMATOMA

12:55.600 --> 12:58.200
At some point,

12:58.760 --> 13:02.600
did the repeater antennas place Samuel
at the home on León XIII Street,

13:02.680 --> 13:04.080
on the night of the events?

13:04.160 --> 13:05.320
No.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.440
Was there any type of genetic profile
found in the home on León XIII Street

13:09.520 --> 13:11.840
that implicates Samuel Benítez
in the events?

13:12.440 --> 13:13.480
No.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.560
Were there any fingerprints found
that implicate him in the events?

13:17.640 --> 13:18.560
No.

13:19.440 --> 13:24.520
Was there any genetic profile found
on his clothing that was seized from him,

13:25.440 --> 13:27.160
that implicates him in the events?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.120
No.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.880
Apart from his confession...

13:34.120 --> 13:37.480
is there any other evidence
that incriminates him in the events?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.920
Nothing that is science-based.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.240
SUBJECT: REFERRING
TO ITEMS OF CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR

13:44.320 --> 13:47.360
THE SEARCH, STUDY, ANALYSIS
AND SUBSEQUENT REPORT

13:47.440 --> 13:48.800
OF SAMUEL'S CLOTHES AND SHOES

13:48.880 --> 13:51.320
NO CRIMINALLY RELEVANT STAINS FOUND

13:51.400 --> 13:53.440
NO CRIMINALLY RELEVANT STAINS FOUND

13:53.520 --> 13:56.000
NO CRIMINALLY RELEVANT STAINS
FOUND

13:58.520 --> 14:02.960
<i>Did you get a call at 11:34 p.m.</i>
<i>from Marta's mother,</i>

14:03.040 --> 14:04.480
<i>asking you about her daughter?</i>

14:04.560 --> 14:05.840
No.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.120
-You didn't get a call?
-I did not get any calls.

14:14.240 --> 14:18.000
At the trial,
it was shocking, very surprising...

14:18.080 --> 14:21.360
You can even see the prosecutor's reaction
when they ask him

14:21.440 --> 14:23.800
about the call at 11:34 p.m.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.360
that he gets from Eva, Marta's mother,

14:26.440 --> 14:29.120
because it's a call that was registered.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.160
CALL LOG: SAMUEL BENÍTEZ

14:35.720 --> 14:37.040
11:34:41 p.m.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.280
Eva,

14:38.360 --> 14:42.600
Samuel said in court
that the call you made at 11:34 p.m.,

14:42.680 --> 14:44.680
which lasted one minute and 14 seconds,

14:44.760 --> 14:47.200
did not take place,
that you never called him.

14:47.280 --> 14:51.040
<i>Well, I have the bill,</i>

14:51.120 --> 14:54.360
<i>where all the calls</i>
<i>I made that night are included.</i>

14:54.440 --> 14:56.000
<i>In other words, Samuel is lying.</i>

14:57.840 --> 14:58.920
<i>I called Samuel.</i>

14:59.000 --> 15:01.240
<i>I said, "Hello, Samuel.</i>
<i>I'm Marta's mother."</i>

15:01.320 --> 15:03.320
<i>"I know she's been with Miguel."</i>

15:03.400 --> 15:06.960
<i>He replied, "Oh, yes, I've spoken to him."</i>

15:07.040 --> 15:10.120
"He told me
he left Marta at 12 o'clock."

15:10.200 --> 15:12.960
Then, I noticed my husband do this

15:13.040 --> 15:14.960
and said, "It's not 12 o'clock yet."

15:15.040 --> 15:20.480
But how could he possibly know that
Miguel had left your daughter at home?

15:20.560 --> 15:24.760
Samuel, on the 24th, at 9:24 p.m.,

15:24.840 --> 15:28.520
did you receive a call from the minor,
from a phone booth?

15:29.080 --> 15:31.720
<i>I don't know where the call came from,</i>
<i>but the minor called.</i>

15:31.800 --> 15:33.440
<i>What did he say in that call?</i>

15:33.520 --> 15:38.440
That he was out drinking in a park
next to the San Pablo Sports Center

15:38.960 --> 15:44.400
and that if I went to Seville,
we could meet up and sleep at his house.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.200
That was the end of the conversation.

15:48.640 --> 15:53.080
<i>I imagine, during the call</i>
<i>that "El Cuco" made to Samuel,</i>

15:53.640 --> 15:55.640
<i>he told him what he had seen,</i>

15:55.720 --> 15:58.320
<i>what had happened</i>
<i>in the apartment on León XIII Street.</i>

15:58.400 --> 16:01.800
See, Eva, I say this
with all the love in the world,

16:01.880 --> 16:04.240
but the only thing a court can do

16:04.320 --> 16:08.640
is convict the accused based on
the evidence that has been presented.

16:08.720 --> 16:13.040
That is to say, the court can
only consider what's put on the table.

16:13.120 --> 16:17.440
When I see this board,
I'm shocked,

16:17.520 --> 16:21.400
seeing this evidence,
in relation to the people who were there,

16:21.480 --> 16:23.440
because it shows that Samuel is lying.

16:24.120 --> 16:28.240
Did your private attorney,
your private prosecution,

16:28.320 --> 16:29.840
present this evidence in court?

16:29.920 --> 16:33.280
Did the Public Prosecutor's Office
present this evidence in court?

16:34.000 --> 16:37.600
Since the prosecution
had delivered such a good performance

16:37.680 --> 16:39.200
and done everything impeccably,

16:39.280 --> 16:44.880
the private prosecution
followed their example, so to speak.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.240
So we had a relatively comfortable
position in the trial, right?

16:48.320 --> 16:51.600
I believe that they shouldn't have
worked with the Prosecutor's Office,

16:51.680 --> 16:55.040
not because the Prosecutor's Office
did it wrong or failed to do it right.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.440
We're not saying that.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.360
But because the family's interests
are not those of the Prosecutor's Office.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.480
<i>And lastly, Samuel,</i>
<i>where is Marta del Castillo's body?</i>

17:05.560 --> 17:10.960
Well, I don't know, Mr. Prosecutor,
and if I may...?

17:11.480 --> 17:15.240
No, I'm just asking you where it is.
If you don't know, I've finished...

17:28.960 --> 17:30.520
Your name, please.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.680
Eva María Casanueva Núñez.

17:34.440 --> 17:38.200
With the court's permission, I'll proceed.
Eva, how do you feel at present?

17:39.120 --> 17:41.600
Well, I'm really depressed.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.440
For me, it would be
very important and very necessary

17:46.520 --> 17:49.080
to recover what is left
of my daughter's body,

17:49.760 --> 17:51.960
so that I may at least have that relief,

17:52.040 --> 17:55.800
and live the rest of my days with
the grief over what they have done to her.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.440
Eva, is it true

17:57.520 --> 18:01.960
that every version Miguel gave concerning
the location of your daughter's body

18:02.040 --> 18:06.880
was tremendously humiliating
or a tremendous indignity for you?

18:06.960 --> 18:08.240
It was endless torture.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.800
To think that my daughter
has been missing for 21 days,

18:10.880 --> 18:13.480
not knowing if she's well
or if she's doing badly,

18:14.120 --> 18:15.880
if they are hurting her...

18:15.960 --> 18:18.000
They told me that they killed her.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.080
Then my husband told me,

18:20.160 --> 18:23.240
"Don't worry, she didn't suffer.
It was a single blow."

18:23.760 --> 18:27.360
And then to hear that she was raped.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.480
And then to listen to another version,

18:33.160 --> 18:34.600
in which they said

18:35.360 --> 18:36.560
that she was strangled.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.720
Each time
I heard a different version, well...

18:40.800 --> 18:43.800
it made my heart sink more and more.

18:45.600 --> 18:51.440
I always tried to keep my composure,
because I always said,

18:51.520 --> 18:55.960
"I don't want them
to see me looking weak, to see me cry."

18:56.040 --> 18:58.080
<i>Because I...</i>
<i>Maybe it was in my head,</i>

18:58.160 --> 19:02.040
<i>but I thought that they were</i>
<i>kind of enjoying my suffering, you know?</i>

19:02.920 --> 19:04.440
<i>And I said, "No."</i>

19:04.520 --> 19:07.280
<i>"They have to see</i>
<i>that we're strong parents,</i>

19:07.360 --> 19:11.720
<i>and they can't see us looking weak."</i>

19:14.360 --> 19:17.200
Good morning. Will you please take a seat?

19:20.880 --> 19:23.920
<i>When I sat down to testify</i>
<i>I was able to see their faces.</i>

19:24.520 --> 19:28.440
Because I'd never had the chance
to see their faces.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.120
Well, that's the memory I have.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.840
It's the memory I have of them.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.760
At what time did you go
to the apartment on 78 León XIII Street?

19:43.840 --> 19:45.800
I got there at about...

19:47.760 --> 19:52.720
12:30 or 12:45 or 12:40 a.m., or so.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.920
-Were you alone or with others?
-I was alone.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.840
Did you knock on the shutters?
Did you try to lift them?

19:59.920 --> 20:01.000
Were the lights on?

20:01.080 --> 20:04.360
I first looked to see
if any of the lights were on,

20:05.080 --> 20:07.120
but I saw no lights through the windows.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.640
<i>Then I knocked on the shutters.</i>

20:10.800 --> 20:17.320
The knock on the shutters, was it
loud enough to be heard from inside?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.280
Perhaps they went unheard?

20:19.360 --> 20:22.280
I knocked hard enough
for it to be heard from inside.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.360
Antonio, another question:
how are you feeling at present?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.880
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm desperate to find my daughter.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.840
To live every day, well...

20:34.480 --> 20:38.040
in a constant state of uncertainty,
thinking about...

20:38.120 --> 20:40.520
well logically, about finding her,

20:41.360 --> 20:43.440
and racking my brain

20:43.520 --> 20:46.520
about the different versions
that he's given...

20:47.960 --> 20:48.960
<i>I...</i>

20:49.800 --> 20:53.520
<i>On the one hand,</i>
<i>I'm eager for him to say something,</i>

20:53.600 --> 20:56.640
<i>but on the other hand,</i>
<i>it could be just another lie,</i>

20:56.720 --> 20:59.880
<i>and I don't want to get my hopes up.</i>

20:59.960 --> 21:03.960
<i>-And... I don't know. It's like...</i>
<i>-There are no words?</i>

21:04.040 --> 21:07.040
This is a continuous daily struggle.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.520
<i>In a few seconds, court will resume.</i>

21:12.600 --> 21:17.960
<i>Now we'll see</i>
<i>Francisco Javier's girlfriend,</i>

21:18.040 --> 21:19.760
<i>María García, on the stand.</i>

21:19.840 --> 21:21.840
<i>She'll tell what happened that night.</i>

21:23.160 --> 21:26.200
FOR CONCEALMENT
AND CRIMES AGAINST MORAL INTEGRITY

21:26.720 --> 21:29.800
María, did you have keys
to the León XIII Street apartment?

21:29.880 --> 21:31.160
Yes, Javi gave them--

21:31.240 --> 21:33.360
-When did he give them to you?
-At 11:30.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.440
That's why we met up.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.320
I've only been there by myself once,
which was on that day.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.960
Normally, I'd always go with Javier.
Never alone.

21:41.040 --> 21:45.240
<i>Maria, is it true</i>
<i>that at about 12:30 that night,</i>

21:45.320 --> 21:48.400
<i>someone knocked on the outside</i>
<i>living room shutters?</i>

21:48.480 --> 21:49.720
<i>I didn't hear anything.</i>

21:49.800 --> 21:52.720
<i>-You didn't hear anything?</i>
<i>-No, no.</i>

21:52.800 --> 21:55.320
At that time, did you have
the living room light on?

21:55.400 --> 21:57.840
Yes, I can't study with the light off.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.760
One last question, María.
Where is Marta del Castillo's body?

22:00.840 --> 22:02.640
-I don't know.
-No further questions.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.440
<i>Look, it's Francisco Javier.</i>

22:08.000 --> 22:09.280
<i>According to the prosecutor,</i>

22:09.360 --> 22:11.880
<i>Francisco Javier Delgado</i>
<i>is the mastermind,</i>

22:11.960 --> 22:14.160
<i>the one who devised</i>
<i>how to get rid of the body.</i>

22:14.240 --> 22:18.320
<i>Today, Miguel Carcaño's brother</i>
<i>has experienced his most intense moment.</i>

22:18.400 --> 22:21.720
<i>People wanted</i>
<i>to see his face at all costs.</i>

22:21.800 --> 22:23.000
Son of a bitch!

22:23.720 --> 22:25.120
Yes, you!

22:27.520 --> 22:28.840
Son of a bitch!

22:34.800 --> 22:37.040
There was one thing
that caught my attention,

22:37.120 --> 22:39.960
which was that the brother,
in regards to concealment,

22:40.040 --> 22:44.680
was exempt from any kind of penalty
under Spanish law.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.200
Being his brother,

22:46.280 --> 22:49.480
he cannot be convicted for concealment,
which is the funniest part.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.680
He can't cover-up for a relative.

22:51.760 --> 22:54.360
By that, I mean
that his conduct will go unpunished.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.440
COURTHOUSE

22:56.520 --> 23:01.360
The anachronism of active concealment,
not only failing to report an incident,

23:01.440 --> 23:03.960
but also being involved in the activity,

23:04.040 --> 23:07.160
is another criteria
that should be considered

23:07.240 --> 23:08.680
for legislative reform.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.560
Mr. Delgado,
it's your turn to be questioned.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.160
Please take your seat.

23:13.240 --> 23:16.440
CONCEALMENT, MENACING,
CRIMES AGAINST MORAL INTEGRITY

23:16.520 --> 23:20.520
<i>Francisco Javier, please try to remember</i>
<i>the day of Marta's disappearance.</i>

23:20.600 --> 23:24.600
<i>Is it true that</i>
<i>at approximately 8:00-8:30,</i>

23:24.680 --> 23:27.040
<i>you heard the door to your house open?</i>

23:27.120 --> 23:30.640
Yes, only my brother and I
had a key to the house,

23:30.720 --> 23:32.160
so if I was inside,

23:32.240 --> 23:34.520
the only one
who could access the house was him.

23:34.600 --> 23:35.600
Good.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.960
I asked him
if he was going to be there long,

23:38.040 --> 23:40.840
because when I left the bathroom
after taking a shower,

23:40.920 --> 23:43.000
I had a missed call from María,

23:44.360 --> 23:46.400
to which I respond, and she--

23:46.480 --> 23:48.600
Excuse me,
didn't you call María three times?

23:48.680 --> 23:49.600
I don't remember.

23:49.680 --> 23:54.200
-That information will be in my call log.
-Good.

CALL LOG FOR FRANCISCO JAVIER DELGADO

TIME: 8:30:59 - 8:34:24 - 8:41:25

24:00.120 --> 24:03.920
On the way to the bus stop,
or after leaving the house,

24:04.000 --> 24:05.680
I called María,

24:05.760 --> 24:09.120
to tell her that my brother
had told me that he wouldn't be long,

24:09.200 --> 24:11.960
that she'd be able to go there and study.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.040
LEÓN XIII STREET

24:13.120 --> 24:17.960
8:41 p.m. - FRANCISCO JAVIER CALLS MARÍA

24:19.440 --> 24:22.920
Miguel Carcaño said in his statements
that on the night,

24:23.000 --> 24:27.440
Marta received a call on her cell phone
from her friend Cristina

24:27.520 --> 24:29.160
and that he rejected the call.

24:29.240 --> 24:33.040
<i>This allows us to deduce that,</i>
<i>by that time, Marta could have been dead.</i>

24:33.120 --> 24:35.440
8:28 p.m. - MIGUEL REJECTS CALL
ON MARTA'S PHONE

24:35.520 --> 24:39.920
And did Marta's phone give a signal?
That is, did it ring?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.480
Or did it appear to be out of range?

24:42.560 --> 24:43.640
It rang.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.040
But then I called back,
and they rejected the call.

24:46.120 --> 24:49.200
And when I made the next call,
the phone had been turned off.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.160
The call that you say they rejected,

24:51.240 --> 24:53.080
at approximately what time was that?

24:53.800 --> 24:58.240
<i>I don't know. Perhaps eight something...</i>
<i>Past 8:20.</i>

24:58.320 --> 24:59.640
<i>Later than twenty past eight.</i>

24:59.720 --> 25:01.720
8:28:07 p.m.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.880
Miguel Carcaño's brother,
Francisco Javier...

25:05.960 --> 25:11.400
If you see these lines,
his phone places him at León XIII.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.920
If he was at León XIII, let's move up,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.280
he witnessed Marta's murder,

25:15.360 --> 25:18.360
or at least he was in the same place
where Marta was killed,

25:18.440 --> 25:21.120
because at 8:28 p.m.,
according to the police, Marta...

25:21.200 --> 25:23.600
This is a cross. Marta was dead.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.400
<i>When you left the apartment,</i>
<i>where did you go?</i>

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
I went to the line 2 bus stop that is
closest to the León XIII Street apartment,

25:38.080 --> 25:40.240
to take the bus and...

25:40.760 --> 25:44.480
And I go to Tharsis Street,
where I had arranged to meet my daughter.

25:44.560 --> 25:48.520
Isn't it true you had arranged
to meet your ex-wife, Rosa, right?

25:48.600 --> 25:49.720
Precisely.

25:49.800 --> 25:53.600
You remained, approximately, between
two and a quarter and two and a half hours

25:53.680 --> 25:57.440
-inside Rosa's home, right?
-Between 9:00 and 11:30 p.m.

25:57.520 --> 26:01.480
I might have left
even a little after 11:30 p.m.

26:02.440 --> 26:06.360
Is it true that you arrived
at approximately 11:45 p.m. at the bar?

26:06.440 --> 26:10.080
It's possible. I remember perfectly well
that it was before midnight.

26:10.160 --> 26:15.120
Do you recall if any customers came in
from 01:30 to 03:00 a.m.?

26:16.200 --> 26:19.520
I don't know. It must be recorded
in the receipts from the register.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.600
I don't know.

26:20.680 --> 26:24.840
DSEDA BAR

26:24.920 --> 26:26.520
Isn't that remarkable?

26:26.600 --> 26:31.800
We have the receipts you provided, proving
that you made only 25 euros that night.

26:32.360 --> 26:38.360
Aren't those very low earnings
for a bar in Seville on a Saturday?

26:38.440 --> 26:40.800
Yes, it was a bar that didn't work out...

26:40.880 --> 26:44.280
I mean, let's just say
that the bar was a disaster.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.200
There is audio evidence
that contradicts that.

26:49.880 --> 26:50.760
<i>Talk to me.</i>

26:50.840 --> 26:52.640
<i>Dude, what's up?</i>

26:52.720 --> 26:55.520
<i>-What's up? What's up, dude?</i>
<i>-How are you doing?</i>

26:55.600 --> 26:57.320
<i>Good, good. Well enough.</i>

26:57.920 --> 26:59.560
<i>So, how did it go?</i>

26:59.640 --> 27:02.480
<i>Well, there was</i>
<i>about 280 or so in the register...</i>

27:02.560 --> 27:03.960
<i>That's so fucking great!</i>

27:04.040 --> 27:07.960
<i>And I've made 100-something today.</i>

27:08.040 --> 27:09.720
<i>-How much?</i>
<i>-100-something.</i>

27:09.800 --> 27:11.240
FRANCISCO JAVIER CALLS HIS EMPLOYEE

27:11.320 --> 27:14.840
<i>-How much did you make yesterday?</i>
<i>-484. It was the best night of the year.</i>

27:14.920 --> 27:16.080
<i>Fucking awesome.</i>

27:17.480 --> 27:21.600
<i>It's a great night then, isn't it?</i>
<i>At least 500 euros, right?</i>

27:21.680 --> 27:22.680
<i>Yeah, more or less.</i>

27:22.760 --> 27:24.400
<i>Wow. Fucking great, man.</i>

27:24.480 --> 27:27.400
DSEDA BAR

27:30.960 --> 27:33.480
<i>Where did you go when you closed the bar?</i>

27:33.560 --> 27:36.280
To a bar called Mínimo.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.200
Did you go to the Mínimo bar

27:40.280 --> 27:44.960
to confirm if the bartender
saw Francisco Javier that night?

27:45.560 --> 27:47.200
-No.
-No...

27:50.480 --> 27:51.720
Let's move on to Sunday.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.360
What were the possible
opening hours for the bar?

27:54.440 --> 27:58.200
Well, the opening hours
could have been, um...

27:59.240 --> 28:01.680
Let's see,
if it was not opening for the morning,

28:01.760 --> 28:04.800
it would open at coffee time,
in the afternoon.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.560
Possibly open
at 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon.

28:07.640 --> 28:10.800
You opened at 10:52 p.m. that Sunday.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.520
ARMING AND DISARMING OF ALARM

28:12.600 --> 28:13.600
<i>That's possible.</i>

28:13.680 --> 28:17.120
<i>You understand that, all in all,</i>
<i>it's interesting that just that day...</i>

28:17.200 --> 28:19.640
Just that day...
You understand that it stands out...

28:19.720 --> 28:21.800
But why does it stand out?

28:21.880 --> 28:25.000
You have to check
the other days I worked there.

28:25.080 --> 28:29.160
So you can see
the difference there, right?

28:29.240 --> 28:31.800
You can... Um...

28:32.440 --> 28:36.040
You have to take a sample,
like everything in life.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.640
You can't just look at one thing.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.960
You have to look
at many of the same things

28:40.040 --> 28:41.960
to know if it's normal or not.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.400
ALARM DEACTIVATION
JANUARY 2009

28:45.720 --> 28:48.840
-You asked for a sampling, right?
-Yeah. Tell me.

28:48.920 --> 28:51.080
So, during all of that month,

28:51.160 --> 28:55.640
on Sundays you open at 12:27 p.m.,
1:04 p.m., 12:36 p.m.

28:55.720 --> 28:59.840
We reach the 25th
and you open at 10:49 p.m.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.360
Uh... How long was the bar open?

29:06.120 --> 29:07.400
-Two hours.
-Two hours.

29:07.480 --> 29:11.520
22:49:52 - DEACTIVATION
01:34:59 - ACTIVATION

29:11.600 --> 29:14.000
Well, maybe I went
to have a drink by myself.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.320
It's my bar. I can go at any time I want
and whenever I want.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.920
The register was locked, right?
You always lock it.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.520
Sometimes we didn't lock the register.

29:24.600 --> 29:30.640
How is it possible that the register
was locked at 12:47 p.m. that day,

29:31.520 --> 29:33.400
when the alarm inside the bar was on?

29:33.480 --> 29:34.360
What?

29:34.440 --> 29:39.040
How could the register be locked
at 12:47 p.m. on the 25th

29:39.120 --> 29:42.520
when the alarm was on
and no one was there?

29:44.400 --> 29:45.720
No, it's not possible.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.920
If the alarm is activated,
you can't be inside the bar.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.440
The alarm would go off.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.960
Then how do you explain
these documents that prove it?

29:54.560 --> 29:55.840
I don't know.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.000
FROM - UNTIL - REGISTER 1

29:59.080 --> 30:02.720
10:49:52 p.m. DEACTIVATION

30:02.800 --> 30:06.320
<i>With the court's permission.</i>
<i>Joaquín, do you know Francisco Javier?</i>

30:06.400 --> 30:07.240
<i>Yes.</i>

30:07.320 --> 30:10.720
<i>Is it true that you were</i>
<i>business partners of a bar in 2009?</i>

30:10.800 --> 30:11.680
<i>Yes.</i>

30:11.760 --> 30:15.560
On the day Marta del Castillo disappeared,

30:15.640 --> 30:18.480
is it true that the register
was not locked that night?

30:18.560 --> 30:22.040
-Is it true that you checked?
-Yes, it was open.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.080
Isn't it true that the point of sale,
where it's recorded,

30:26.160 --> 30:30.320
it is not possible to alter
the recorded purchase time?

30:30.400 --> 30:32.280
-It is possible.
-To change the time?

30:32.360 --> 30:33.200
Yes.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.720
PART OWNER OF DSEDA BAR
WITNESS

30:38.320 --> 30:41.480
There are new developments
in the Marta del Castillo investigation

30:41.560 --> 30:45.200
which focus on Miguel Carcaño's brother,
Francisco Javier.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.800
To the family,
he has always been the mastermind

30:47.880 --> 30:50.040
behind the disappearance of Marta's body.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.600
They have no doubt about it, Susanna.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.960
It turns out that a security camera
captured Francisco Javier.

30:56.040 --> 31:00.480
That is the doorway, the house
where Francisco Javier Delgado went,

31:00.560 --> 31:01.840
according to his statement,

31:01.920 --> 31:05.960
to spend part of that night
with his wife and daughter.

31:06.040 --> 31:10.600
That's the place, that's the video camera
that recorded him.

31:10.680 --> 31:15.600
<i>It recorded Francisco Javier leaving,</i>
<i>but pay attention, at 9:15 p.m.</i>

31:15.680 --> 31:19.000
<i>Watch, because he doesn't</i>
<i>even stay in that house for 15 minutes.</i>

31:19.080 --> 31:22.160
<i>And to top it off,</i>
<i>there's a friend who has recognized him</i>

31:22.240 --> 31:23.800
<i>by the way he walks.</i>

31:23.880 --> 31:27.480
<i>If it's true that at 9:15 p.m.</i>
<i>he's captured leaving,</i>

31:27.560 --> 31:31.040
<i>it's logical to think</i>
<i>that he had returned to León XIII Street,</i>

31:31.120 --> 31:34.360
<i>because nobody sees him</i>
<i>until after 11:00 p.m. or so</i>

31:34.440 --> 31:36.480
<i>when he arrives at the bar where he works.</i>

31:36.560 --> 31:39.920
<i>One would have to ask him</i>
<i>why he's told the court</i>

31:40.000 --> 31:42.920
<i>something that a security camera</i>
<i>has proven to be false.</i>

31:49.160 --> 31:51.880
IT HASN'T BEEN POSSIBLE.
WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.880
THE INVESTIGATIONS
HAVE NOT BROUGHT POSITIVE RESULTS.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.440
WE'VE BEEN PLAGUED BY BAD LUCK.

31:56.520 --> 32:02.480
<i>Antonio del Castillo had high hopes</i>
<i>for this new line of investigation,</i>

32:02.560 --> 32:07.560
<i>but the recording couldn't be accepted</i>
<i>due to its poor quality.</i>

32:09.560 --> 32:11.280
Unfortunately, it's not valid.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.920
Although technology
is advancing a lot and...

32:14.640 --> 32:17.520
And we could have...
But no, we've not been able to do it.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.360
It hasn't been possible.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.640
It cannot be used in the trial

32:21.720 --> 32:25.920
and, well, it had to be rushed
because the time to use it was now.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.720
There are no more chances.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.680
He's been just so lucky,

32:31.760 --> 32:35.920
had he planned it this perfectly,
it wouldn't have worked out for him

32:36.000 --> 32:37.160
as well as it has.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.240
<i>There is a crowd here.</i>
<i>We, the media, are waiting as well.</i>

32:48.320 --> 32:52.400
<i>Because we don't know if "El Cuco"</i>
<i>will finally enter through the front door</i>

32:52.480 --> 32:56.600
<i>or if he'll enter through the back door.</i>
<i>He hasn't requested police protection--</i>

32:56.680 --> 32:58.880
<i>-Sorry to interrupt, but what's going on?</i>
<i>-Yes...</i>

32:58.960 --> 33:02.520
<i>You're seeing it live.</i>
<i>As far as we can tell, that's "El Cuco."</i>

33:02.600 --> 33:03.840
<i>What? Is that "El Cuco"?</i>

33:03.920 --> 33:05.760
<i>-He's wearing a wig.</i>
<i>-Yes, long hair.</i>

33:05.840 --> 33:08.440
<i>-His face is covered by glasses.</i>
<i>-He's walking like a man.</i>

33:08.520 --> 33:11.800
<i>Francisco Javier García Marín.</i>
<i>"El Cuco." There he is at last.</i>

33:11.880 --> 33:15.440
<i>There are shouts from all the people</i>
<i>waiting for the arrival of "El Cuco."</i>

33:15.520 --> 33:17.200
<i>He's removing what's necessary.</i>

33:17.280 --> 33:19.680
<i>-Yes, it is him.</i>
<i>-We've just seen his face.</i>

33:20.400 --> 33:25.080
I think that the person who undoubtedly
caused the greatest shock was...

33:26.800 --> 33:27.640
"El Cuco."

33:30.360 --> 33:31.400
Phew...

33:32.280 --> 33:35.320
"El Cuco's" arrival
at the adults' trial...

33:36.800 --> 33:39.360
Well, it was...
For me, it was a grotesque sight

33:40.120 --> 33:45.280
to see him arriving with that hair,
looking very cocky.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.400
Is this the famous "Cuco"?

33:52.480 --> 33:56.800
Would you be kind enough to keep your hair
out of your face while you testify?

33:56.880 --> 33:59.240
You are here to testify as a witness.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.760
As a witness, you must answer
all the questions that follow,

34:02.840 --> 34:05.440
and you must answer honestly.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.960
-Do you swear to tell the truth?
-Yes.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.920
-Do you swear?
-I swear.

34:10.000 --> 34:10.840
Very well, then.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.480
The Public Prosecutor's Office
may question its witness.

34:13.560 --> 34:19.000
Francisco Javier, is it true
that you and Samuel took your mother's car

34:19.080 --> 34:21.960
and drove to the apartment
on León XIII Street?

34:22.040 --> 34:22.920
No.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.280
Is it true that Samuel came out
of the León XIII Street apartment

34:29.360 --> 34:32.720
and told you that
there was a very big mess inside?

34:32.800 --> 34:33.720
No.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.840
And is it true
that when you were inside the apartment,

34:37.920 --> 34:40.480
you saw Miguel's brother,
Francisco Javier,

34:40.560 --> 34:42.000
and he seemed very nervous?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.040
No.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.560
And did he threaten you,

34:44.640 --> 34:48.600
saying that something bad would happen
to your family if you talked about it?

34:48.680 --> 34:52.880
No, that man never threatened me.
The police put pressure on me.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.880
And what you told
the examining magistrate, is that true?

34:55.960 --> 34:56.800
No.

34:56.880 --> 35:01.920
Why, then, did you give so much detail
and a perfectly coherent testimony?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.960
-The police told me to say that.
-Pardon me?

35:04.040 --> 35:05.960
I repeated what the police told me to say.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.240
But, Francisco Javier,
the police were not there.

35:08.320 --> 35:11.720
We're already in-- We're speaking
of the 4th Court of Examination.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.720
It was February 18th.

35:13.800 --> 35:17.160
And who took me there?
Because they brought me back and forth...

35:17.240 --> 35:20.320
Mr. García Marín, do not interrupt
the Public Prosecutor's Office.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.760
Could you please...

35:23.240 --> 35:25.520
tell the court,

35:26.640 --> 35:29.720
so that the parents can be at peace...

35:29.800 --> 35:33.880
Can you give us some information
so we can find Marta?

35:34.400 --> 35:37.360
If I knew, I would have told you long ago.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.440
And if you want to know, ask him.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.480
-He's the one who should know.
-Ask who?

35:41.560 --> 35:43.360
There's no need for that.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.640
Okay, agreed.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.960
I don't care if you agree.
That's not how you address the court.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.480
The mistake this child made, I think,

35:51.560 --> 35:56.200
was not telling the entire truth
of what he saw,

35:56.840 --> 35:58.360
which was not insignificant.

35:59.640 --> 36:04.120
And to this day, I think that "El Cuco"

36:04.760 --> 36:08.880
is only guilty of arriving at that moment

36:08.960 --> 36:11.840
and seeing Marta dead,
I'm sure of that,

36:11.920 --> 36:14.080
and not telling the police about it.

36:21.520 --> 36:26.280
NOVEMBER 29, 2011
THE LAST DAY OF THE ADULTS' TRIAL

36:29.480 --> 36:32.760
<i>We're entering the final stage</i>
<i>of the trial, closing arguments,</i>

36:32.840 --> 36:35.360
<i>in case any of the defendants</i>
<i>wish to add anything</i>

36:35.440 --> 36:39.080
<i>to what has been said during this session</i>
<i>and the previous 18 sessions.</i>

36:39.160 --> 36:41.560
<i>Mr. Carcaño,</i>
<i>would you like to add anything?</i>

36:41.640 --> 36:46.200
<i>I want to apologize to Marta's family</i>
<i>for the damage caused.</i>

36:47.360 --> 36:48.800
<i>Mr. Benítez?</i>

36:48.880 --> 36:52.280
<i>Marta was also a friend of mine,</i>
<i>and I had nothing to do with this.</i>

36:54.520 --> 36:55.680
<i>I can't ease their pain,</i>

36:55.760 --> 36:59.000
<i>because I don't know anything</i>
<i>about what happened to Marta.</i>

37:00.440 --> 37:02.800
<i>Mr. Delgado,</i>
<i>would you like to add anything?</i>

37:02.880 --> 37:05.840
<i>I know that many people</i>
<i>are having a hard time with this case,</i>

37:05.920 --> 37:07.320
<i>especially Marta's family,</i>

37:07.400 --> 37:11.520
<i>but there is nothing I can say or do</i>
<i>to ease that pain,</i>

37:11.600 --> 37:13.240
<i>which, as a parent, I understand.</i>

37:15.440 --> 37:18.760
<i>For the sentencing we ask the public</i>
<i>to please leave the room.</i>

37:33.000 --> 37:35.720
Paloma, good morning.
What did Carcaño say to you?

37:35.800 --> 37:37.480
How did he feel about the sentence?

37:37.560 --> 37:40.600
Well, just imagine, how would
20 years in prison make you feel?

37:42.280 --> 37:46.800
Only Miguel Carcaño will go to prison
for the crimes against Marta del Castillo.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.600
The rest of the defendants,

37:48.680 --> 37:51.440
Samuel Benítez,
Carcaño's brother, and his girlfriend,

37:51.520 --> 37:52.920
have been acquitted.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.280
The judge believes
there is insufficient evidence

37:55.360 --> 37:58.760
to prove that they took part
in Marta's murder.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.400
I want to apologize<i> </i>to my daughters...

38:17.240 --> 38:19.520
for raising a family in a country

38:20.400 --> 38:25.720
where justice and social standards
are far from satisfactory.

38:25.800 --> 38:31.760
This justice is shit!

38:32.320 --> 38:36.080
You stated,
when the trials were about to begin,

38:36.160 --> 38:39.120
that there was enough evidence
to bring the case to trial,

38:39.200 --> 38:42.400
with the guarantee
that the defendants would be prosecuted,

38:42.480 --> 38:44.960
including María García,
Javier Delgado's girlfriend.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.800
As people, it is possible
that we have a thorn in our side

38:49.880 --> 38:53.760
due to a failure to offer the parents
a definitive period of mourning.

38:53.840 --> 38:57.080
<i>But as a prosecutor,</i>
<i>we have obtained a conviction,</i>

38:57.160 --> 39:00.840
<i>and a legal truth of what happened</i>
<i>has been established.</i>

39:00.920 --> 39:02.600
We know that Marta was murdered.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.800
Where is Marta?

39:05.880 --> 39:09.120
We may or may not like it,

39:09.200 --> 39:12.760
but with the evidence that Section 7 had,

39:12.840 --> 39:15.200
the adult sentence was very harsh.

39:15.280 --> 39:20.160
<i>They imposed the maximum punishment</i>
<i>with very little evidence.</i>

39:20.240 --> 39:21.280
We want justice!

39:21.360 --> 39:25.400
Had he not said, "I killed her..."
Let's put ourselves in that situation.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.080
What proof would there have been?

39:29.160 --> 39:32.120
We are all Marta!

39:32.200 --> 39:35.840
They could have considered it a homicide,

39:35.920 --> 39:39.800
because he is the only prisoner
in the world

39:39.880 --> 39:43.080
who is in prison for murder
without a corpse.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.440
In fact, it's surreal.

39:50.520 --> 39:53.440
Marta was only killed in one way,
and only one thing happened.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.400
The events unfolded one way that night.

39:56.040 --> 40:00.000
<i>And yet we have two outcomes.</i>
<i>The judges in the minor's trial</i>

40:00.080 --> 40:03.400
<i>established that the murder</i>
<i>happened one way</i>

40:03.480 --> 40:06.680
<i>and in the adults' trial,</i>
<i>it happened another way.</i>

40:06.760 --> 40:09.840
So you have two legal truths
that contradict each other.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.680
Something is wrong
with the justice system.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.280
Something has gone wrong.

40:22.160 --> 40:25.560
SEVILLE COURT STATES AT LEAST
ONE UNKNOWN THIRD PARTY PARTICIPATED

40:25.640 --> 40:29.040
The judge said Miguel Carcaño
got rid of the body using a wheelchair

40:29.120 --> 40:32.560
with the help of his friend "El Cuco"
and a third unknown person.

40:32.640 --> 40:36.560
That third person is one
of the great mysteries of this trial.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.280
The verdict says...
we've read it,

40:38.360 --> 40:41.400
that he got rid of the body
with the help of "El Cuco"

40:41.480 --> 40:46.160
and with the help of a third party,
who evidently has not been identified.

40:46.240 --> 40:49.760
If a seven-year-old child
tells me about his imaginary friend,

40:49.840 --> 40:51.160
I wouldn't be shocked.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.840
But for a judge to say this
while delivering a sentence...

40:53.920 --> 40:55.560
I find it very embarrassing.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.080
Well, I don't think they have dared

40:58.160 --> 41:01.480
to give that third stranger a name,

41:01.560 --> 41:04.120
although they know
perfectly well who he is.

41:04.840 --> 41:09.440
My sentence seemed correct.
Correct and fair, of course.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.600
-Do you trust the justice system?
-Yes.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.400
If you trust the justice system,

41:13.480 --> 41:15.480
what about the findings
in the minor's trial

41:15.560 --> 41:18.520
that stated, with evidence,
that you were in the apartment?

41:19.360 --> 41:22.640
The verdict from the minor's trial
never said I was there.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.160
-Yes, yes, yes.
-No, no, no, no.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.320
"Likewise, it's been proven

41:29.400 --> 41:32.520
that once the accused minor
and this second adult

41:32.600 --> 41:36.040
arrived at the aforementioned apartment,
they entered the apartment,

41:36.120 --> 41:42.120
where the adult who had killed Marta
and his brother were.

41:42.200 --> 41:45.120
HIS BROTHER

41:46.400 --> 41:49.840
Well, I don't even remember

41:49.920 --> 41:56.360
being aware of that whole verdict.

41:56.440 --> 41:57.640
I don't remember it.

42:07.080 --> 42:10.080
COURTHOUSE

42:10.160 --> 42:13.120
The police, after the trial was held,

42:13.200 --> 42:16.720
was convinced that the case
had been falsely closed,

42:17.600 --> 42:20.720
and they wanted to know
where Marta del Castillo's body was.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.320
They were determined to find it.

42:22.400 --> 42:25.200
And so, they went
to see Miguel Carcaño in prison.

42:25.280 --> 42:29.520
And in prison, they talked to him,
and they were given a seventh version.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.000
APRIL 29, 2013

42:32.080 --> 42:34.960
<i>He looks different.</i>
<i>His hair is much longer.</i>

42:35.040 --> 42:36.440
<i>He is Miguel Carcaño.</i>

42:36.520 --> 42:38.440
<i>He has returned to the courts in Seville</i>

42:38.520 --> 42:41.640
<i>to explain his latest version</i>
<i>of Marta del Castillo's death.</i>

42:41.720 --> 42:44.560
<i>He has said it was his brother,</i>
<i>Francisco Javier Delgado,</i>

42:44.640 --> 42:47.160
<i>acquitted in the trial, who killed her.</i>

42:48.160 --> 42:52.400
MIGUEL'S SEVENTH VERSION OF EVENTS
APRIL 2013

42:52.480 --> 42:54.360
<i>Miguel explains in his seventh version</i>

42:54.440 --> 42:56.120
<i>that he goes home with Marta.</i>..

42:56.200 --> 42:57.480
<i>He enters the house.</i>..

42:57.560 --> 43:00.240
<i>Marta stays in the room,</i>
<i>Francisco Javier is inside.</i>

43:00.320 --> 43:03.720
He calls him. Miguel goes to talk
to Francisco Javier, who is in the back.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.200
They're hang up laundry.

43:05.280 --> 43:08.320
<i>During that conversation,</i>
<i>while they are hanging up the clothes,</i>

43:08.400 --> 43:12.520
<i>Francisco Javier says to him,</i>
<i>"You haven't been paying the mortgage."</i>

43:13.320 --> 43:16.960
He says Francisco Javier became violent,
that he was trying to hit him,

43:17.040 --> 43:19.960
and he ran away
with the intention of leaving the house,

43:20.040 --> 43:21.880
but he was caught in the hallway.

43:21.960 --> 43:26.960
Then Marta tried to help Miguel
and jumped on Francisco Javier,

43:27.040 --> 43:28.600
who had his back to her.

43:29.880 --> 43:32.240
Francisco Javier turned away from Miguel,

43:32.320 --> 43:34.280
took a gun out from his belt,

43:34.360 --> 43:39.240
and hit Marta several times in the head
with the butt of the gun.

43:39.320 --> 43:42.080
And then Marta fell
into Miguel Carcaño's room, dead.

43:46.080 --> 43:48.280
And he says

43:48.360 --> 43:51.560
that Javier asked him
to take him on his motorcycle

43:51.640 --> 43:54.360
to the house on Tharsis Street
where his ex-wife lived,

43:54.440 --> 43:57.640
and once they'd arrived there,
Javier Delgado took the vehicle,

43:57.720 --> 44:00.640
his ex-wife's car,

44:00.720 --> 44:04.520
and it was in this car
that he returned to León XIII Street.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.560
They began to handle
Marta del Castillo's body.

44:09.640 --> 44:14.080
The buzzer rang, and Miguel,
without thinking, opened the door.

44:15.400 --> 44:19.080
He opened it and "El Cuco" walked in
and saw Marta del Castillo's body.

44:19.160 --> 44:21.640
He saw Francisco Javier and ran away.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.440
Francisco Javier let it be,

44:25.520 --> 44:30.080
and in the end, they put Marta's body
in their mother's wheelchair.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.640
They took the body out,
put it in Rosa's car,

44:33.720 --> 44:36.080
and he told him,
"Follow me on the motorcycle."

44:37.560 --> 44:39.480
The car led and the motorcycle followed.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.920
<i>They had the car, turned left,</i>

44:49.000 --> 44:51.640
<i>arrived at some kind of ditch</i>
<i>where the car could go no further,</i>

44:51.720 --> 44:54.680
<i>threw Marta's body</i>
<i>and then chucked debris on top of her.</i>

45:01.800 --> 45:06.520
Miguel Carcaño pointed out this area,
but didn't point to a specific spot.

45:06.600 --> 45:10.280
He only talked about a ditch
and bricks and debris.

45:16.720 --> 45:19.720
POLICE

45:27.040 --> 45:29.800
<i>The latest version, well...</i>

45:31.080 --> 45:32.880
<i>I'm sure that it's a lie.</i>

45:32.960 --> 45:38.600
Do we believe the first version
where it was the river?

45:38.680 --> 45:45.000
Do we believe it was the landfill?
The farm? I don't know.

45:47.800 --> 45:51.400
How can I say it? Uh... It hurts.

45:51.480 --> 45:57.000
It hurts to know that someone
you've lived with for 17 years

45:57.080 --> 46:00.480
has such a black heart, not only
because of what he's done,

46:00.560 --> 46:03.880
but also because of what
he wants to do to you. Me, in this case.

46:03.960 --> 46:07.440
So, that hurts a lot. A lot.

46:07.520 --> 46:10.440
MARTA ISN'T IN MAJALOBA, EITHER

46:10.520 --> 46:13.280
POLICE SEARCH ENDS AFTER 3 DAYS.
GOVERNMENT KEEPS CASE OPEN.

46:13.360 --> 46:17.440
He accused his brother
of being responsible for Marta's death,

46:17.520 --> 46:20.240
but today the judge has closed the case.

46:20.320 --> 46:25.320
<i>He said that this latest version</i>
<i>was inaccurate, implausible, fanciful,</i>

46:25.400 --> 46:27.600
<i>and, at times, even nonsensical.</i>

46:27.680 --> 46:30.960
<i>In short, a devastating ruling</i>
<i>that not only attacks Miguel Carcaño,</i>

46:31.040 --> 46:32.440
but also the judicial police,

46:32.520 --> 46:35.640
stating that they've gone too far
in investigating Carcaño's brother

46:35.720 --> 46:37.600
for an act he has already been tried for.

46:45.960 --> 46:48.560
One of the attempts the police made,

46:48.640 --> 46:51.760
who were desperate to know
the whereabouts of Marta's body,

46:51.840 --> 46:55.520
was to have Miguel Carcaño take a test

46:55.600 --> 46:57.760
with a device called the P300,

46:57.840 --> 47:01.640
which is based on impressions
caused in the brain by a series of images.

47:01.720 --> 47:02.720
Murderer!

47:02.800 --> 47:05.600
MARCH 6, 2014

47:05.680 --> 47:07.440
<i>That is Miguel Carcaño</i>

47:07.520 --> 47:10.200
<i>upon his arrival</i>
<i>at the Miguel Servet Hospital in Zaragoza,</i>

47:10.280 --> 47:13.800
<i>where, this afternoon,</i>
<i>he underwent the so-called "truth test,"</i>

47:13.880 --> 47:18.560
<i>a neurological test</i>
<i>to check how his brain reacts</i>

47:18.640 --> 47:24.160
<i>to certain images related to the death</i>
<i>and disappearance of Marta del Castillo.</i>

47:24.240 --> 47:30.120
<i>It's the police's latest attempt to</i>
<i>find out where the girl's body is buried.</i>

47:30.200 --> 47:33.440
LOCATING THE REMAINS
OF MARTA DEL CASTILLO

47:33.520 --> 47:36.320
IN LANDFILL
PAST THE OLD BRIDGE TO CAMAS (SEVILLE)

47:38.600 --> 47:39.760
MARCH 8, 2014

47:39.840 --> 47:43.880
<i>The police have informed the family</i>
<i>that they have located some remains</i>

47:43.960 --> 47:48.920
<i>that, pending analysis,</i>
<i>may be those of Marta del Castillo.</i>

47:49.000 --> 47:51.360
<i>I came as soon as they called.</i>
<i>I was asleep.</i>

47:51.440 --> 47:54.080
-Of course.
-I jumped out of bed and left for Camas.

47:54.160 --> 47:55.960
POLICE

47:56.040 --> 47:58.080
<i>You can imagine how I was feeling.</i>

47:58.160 --> 48:01.200
I couldn't see anything.
I couldn't see anything, anything at all.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.600
And I was so nervous.

48:02.680 --> 48:06.600
The police told me, "Antonio, calm down.
We're going to analyze them."

48:09.680 --> 48:13.560
BONES FOUND IN CAMAS...

48:17.600 --> 48:21.040
WERE NOT THOSE OF MARTA DEL CASTILLO

48:25.760 --> 48:27.520
Those continuous searches,

48:28.200 --> 48:31.840
motivated by Miguel's statements,

48:32.800 --> 48:38.080
should have been investigated
before they proceeded with the search,

48:38.160 --> 48:41.240
but everyone was in a hurry
to find the corpse.

48:44.200 --> 48:45.760
<i>It's not Miguel's fault.</i>

48:45.840 --> 48:48.680
<i>It's the fault of those</i>
<i>who were running around</i>

48:48.760 --> 48:54.920
<i>searching in places that should have been</i>
<i>checked out beforehand, if possible,</i>

48:55.000 --> 48:58.320
<i>before they proceeded to search</i>
<i>and spend money on it.</i>

48:59.800 --> 49:02.040
With everything that has been done,

49:02.120 --> 49:03.800
the P300...

49:03.880 --> 49:07.120
Well, I don't know
if I can say this or not,

49:07.200 --> 49:08.440
but anyway,

49:09.120 --> 49:10.720
it's been a while.

49:10.800 --> 49:15.760
He was given hypnosis tests.
I was there.

49:16.480 --> 49:21.640
A psychiatrist or a police technician
hypnotized him.

49:21.720 --> 49:26.520
The only thing left to do
would have been to bring in a psychic

49:26.600 --> 49:32.240
and with a photo
of the deceased young woman to try to...

49:34.000 --> 49:35.320
find the corpse.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.880
I mean...

49:36.960 --> 49:42.040
It seems that the police were desperate
and thought, "Well, let's give it a try."

49:42.120 --> 49:45.880
Yes, in the case, there has been
a massive use of psychics.

49:45.960 --> 49:50.200
There is probably a box
in the Seville police station...

49:50.280 --> 49:51.800
PSYCHIC LOOKED FOR MARTA

49:51.880 --> 49:53.120
...that says: "Psychics."

49:53.200 --> 49:56.520
POLICE USED A PSYCHIC
IN THE MARTA DEL CASTILLO CASE

49:56.600 --> 49:58.680
SHE SUGGESTED PLACES
WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS

50:04.000 --> 50:06.800
FEBRUARY 24, 2017
8 YEARS AFTER MARTA'S DISAPPEARANCE

50:08.920 --> 50:11.040
<i>It was about 12 o'clock in the morning,</i>

50:11.120 --> 50:13.800
<i>and I said to my wife,</i>
<i>"Let's put an end to this."</i>

50:17.320 --> 50:21.200
<i>I came here, to the prison,</i>
<i>to Herrera de la Mancha.</i>

50:21.920 --> 50:25.160
What did I have to lose?
I'd already lost everything.

50:29.600 --> 50:34.080
<i>I was thinking, "What do I do?</i>
<i>Do I shake his hand? Do I greet him?"</i>

50:36.480 --> 50:39.440
<i>So, I had to greet him and shake his hand.</i>

50:40.800 --> 50:45.200
<i>His attitude was, well,</i>
<i>like someone who seemed downcast.</i>

50:45.880 --> 50:48.760
I think he was more nervous than I was.

50:48.840 --> 50:51.560
And my first words were,

50:51.640 --> 50:53.520
"Where is she, Miguel?"

50:56.640 --> 51:02.320
And at the end of the conversation,
he told me about the mortgage.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.680
I, MIGUEL CARCAÑO DELGADO,

51:04.760 --> 51:09.960
AUTHORIZE MR. ANTONIO ABAD DEL CASTILLO

51:10.040 --> 51:13.160
TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE
THE DOCUMENTATION AND AMOUNT

51:13.240 --> 51:16.880
I DEPOSITED
FOR THE MORTGAGE I APPLIED FOR...

51:16.960 --> 51:18.240
MORTGAGE

51:22.120 --> 51:24.800
FEBRUARY 2017

51:25.840 --> 51:28.400
<i>The world's fourth largest</i>
<i>investment bank goes bankrupt,</i>

51:28.480 --> 51:30.920
<i>engulfed by the subprime mortgage crisis.</i>

51:31.000 --> 51:33.280
<i>The economy</i>
<i>is clearly in recession in 2009.</i>

51:33.360 --> 51:35.320
Undoubtedly,
it's a year of economic crisis.

51:35.400 --> 51:37.440
-Crisis...
-The effects of the crisis...

51:37.520 --> 51:40.920
-...international crisis.
-<i>...the subprime mortgage crisis.</i>

51:43.400 --> 51:49.240
<i>The 2007-2008 crisis</i>
<i>is known as the subprime mortgage crisis.</i>

51:49.320 --> 51:52.840
So, subprime mortgages are those mortgages

51:52.920 --> 51:56.760
that had a high probability of defaulting.

51:57.760 --> 51:58.760
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

51:58.840 --> 52:04.440
<i>This is a message for Mr. Francisco</i>
<i>Javier Delgado Moreno regarding his loan.</i>

52:04.520 --> 52:08.160
<i>Please contact Finconsum urgently</i>
<i>by calling 90--</i>

52:08.760 --> 52:11.560
<i>This is a message</i>
<i>for Francisco Javier Delgado Moreno.</i>

52:11.640 --> 52:13.120
<i>I'm calling from Intrum Justicia</i>

52:13.200 --> 52:18.080
<i>to discuss the debtor's position</i>
<i>with Unoe Bank.</i>

52:20.240 --> 52:23.280
<i>León XIII Street</i>
<i>belonged to Francisco Javier and Miguel.</i>

52:23.360 --> 52:25.240
<i>They inherited it from their mother.</i>

52:25.320 --> 52:26.920
It already had a mortgage on it,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.960
so Francisco Javier,
who desperately needed money, said,

52:30.040 --> 52:31.480
"Hey, let's do something."

52:31.560 --> 52:33.760
"Let's take out
another mortgage on the house."

52:34.720 --> 52:36.800
UNILATERAL MORTGAGE LOAN

52:36.880 --> 52:38.440
MR. MIGUEL CARCAÑO DELGADO

52:38.520 --> 52:40.320
"THE DEBTOR"

52:41.240 --> 52:43.920
<i>Who did he involve in the mess?</i>
<i>Miguel Carcaño.</i>

52:44.960 --> 52:46.800
<i>Did Miguel Carcaño have a job?</i>

52:47.320 --> 52:48.360
<i>No.</i>

52:48.440 --> 52:51.800
<i>Who knew better than anyone that he</i>
<i>didn't have a job? Francisco Javier. </i>

52:51.880 --> 52:54.680
<i>And yet he told him,</i>
<i>"Ask for a remortgage."</i>

52:55.640 --> 53:02.040
This move, for Miguel Carcaño,
was like venturing into the lion's den,

53:02.120 --> 53:05.080
because he wasn't going
to be able to pay for it.

53:05.160 --> 53:07.840
It would have been miraculous
if he'd been able to.

53:07.920 --> 53:10.400
So miraculous that
he didn't pay the first month.

53:10.480 --> 53:12.280
Unable to pay in the first month.

53:12.360 --> 53:14.440
Payrolls had been forged.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.200
<i>The employment records had been forged.</i>

53:19.480 --> 53:21.640
It was swindling
and document falsification.

53:21.720 --> 53:23.960
DATE: 02/02/2021

53:24.040 --> 53:27.680
THE DOCUMENTS USED TO DRAW UP
THE MORTGAGE WITH BBVA ARE FORGED

53:29.920 --> 53:32.960
<i>Who wants the credit?</i>
<i>Who benefits from the credit?</i>

53:33.040 --> 53:36.080
<i>Francisco Javier. But Miguel Carcaño</i>
<i>appears in the documents.</i>

53:36.160 --> 53:39.680
Who has committed the crime
of document falsification? Miguel Carcaño.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.600
What did Miguel gain? Nothing.

53:41.680 --> 53:43.880
All this leads us to a conclusion.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.720
And that is Miguel Carcaño...

53:45.800 --> 53:49.120
<i>We can at least prove that</i>
<i>at the beginning of his seventh version,</i>

53:49.200 --> 53:50.680
<i>he was telling the truth.</i>

53:50.760 --> 53:54.800
Is it logical that on the 24th
that conversation took place? Yes.

53:54.880 --> 53:58.240
Let's see...
Did this discussion take place? Yes.

53:58.320 --> 54:00.440
But not the way he describes it, no.

54:00.520 --> 54:04.440
At no point did I hit him
and certainly not on the 24th.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.240
NAME: MIGUEL CARCAÑO DELGADO

54:07.320 --> 54:08.760
FEBRUARY 16, 2009

54:09.320 --> 54:15.240
THEY SPOKE ABOUT MATTERS CONCERNING
PAPERWORK RELATING TO THE HOUSE

54:16.920 --> 54:18.640
I'm going to describe a timeline

54:18.720 --> 54:21.000
that could have taken place
on the 24th, okay?

54:21.080 --> 54:22.760
On January 22nd,

54:22.840 --> 54:26.560
some money comes in to make up
the mortgage's late payments.

54:26.640 --> 54:28.800
On the 23rd,
there are no calls between you two,

54:28.880 --> 54:32.280
and when you first meet
after that payment, it's on the 24th.

54:33.560 --> 54:37.520
I insist, on the 24th, I'm sure
that I didn't talk to him about...

54:37.600 --> 54:41.080
Because I didn't talk to him
for more than two minutes.

54:43.880 --> 54:45.160
And I said to my mother,

54:45.240 --> 54:47.280
"Mom, I know about the tax fraud."

54:47.360 --> 54:49.000
"Miguel told me about it."

54:49.480 --> 54:52.040
And she told me,
"Then tell them. Tell the police."

54:52.120 --> 54:54.080
ALEJANDRA PORTILLO
10:30 ON 01/28/09

54:54.160 --> 54:55.320
<i>In the interview, I said,</i>

54:55.400 --> 54:59.520
<i>"I don't know how relevant you'll find</i>
<i>this information, but I know about this."</i>

55:01.680 --> 55:06.160
When I told them that,
they had no interest in looking into it.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.960
No, "Let's see if it's true

55:08.040 --> 55:12.520
and whether they have something
that we can bargain with." Nothing.

55:12.600 --> 55:15.400
POLICE HEADQUARTERS

55:15.480 --> 55:18.960
The problem is that
the statute of limitations has passed.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.600
The police report even says this.

55:21.680 --> 55:23.880
FROM: MIGUEL,
FRANCISCO JAVIER AND ANTONIO

55:23.960 --> 55:27.720
<i>But when Miguel Carcaño</i>
<i>spoke about the mortgage,</i>

55:27.800 --> 55:30.040
<i>when Alejandra spoke about the mortgage...</i>

55:30.120 --> 55:31.640
That wasn't prosecutable yet.

55:31.720 --> 55:33.280
COURTHOUSE

55:33.360 --> 55:34.880
<i>Today, in 2021,</i>

55:34.960 --> 55:38.320
<i>the judge has decided to close</i>
<i>Francisco Javier Delgado's case,</i>

55:38.400 --> 55:39.800
<i>concerning the mortgage issue.</i>

55:39.880 --> 55:42.000
The prosecutor says

55:42.080 --> 55:44.360
it's because he has already been tried.

55:45.280 --> 55:46.560
He won't investigate it.

55:55.040 --> 55:58.000
APRIL 2021

55:58.720 --> 56:02.440
<i>Hi, Paula. Look, there is something</i>
<i>that's caught our attention.</i>

56:02.520 --> 56:04.640
<i>We're reviewing the police investigation</i>

56:04.720 --> 56:07.760
<i>on the cell phones,</i>
<i>the calls, their reports...</i>

56:07.840 --> 56:10.120
<i>We've watched the trial,</i>
<i>and we've noticed</i>

56:10.200 --> 56:13.360
<i>that there's a lot of information missing</i>
<i>regarding the antennas.</i>

56:13.440 --> 56:14.760
<i>If you look at the reports,</i>

56:14.840 --> 56:18.440
<i>the locations are placed in an antenna,</i>
<i>with geographic coordinates.</i>

56:18.520 --> 56:20.240
<i>The information that's provided</i>

56:20.320 --> 56:23.040
<i>should be much more specific</i>
<i>within that antenna.</i>

56:23.120 --> 56:24.880
<i>Within the radius of the antenna,</i>

56:24.960 --> 56:27.560
<i>it should tell us specifically</i>
<i>where the call was made,</i>

56:27.640 --> 56:29.680
<i>where the SMS was registered...</i>

56:29.760 --> 56:32.640
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>that information is not there.</i>

56:36.040 --> 56:42.040
<i>What type of information</i>
<i>is reflected in the cell phone summary?</i>

56:42.120 --> 56:47.040
The records of the antennas used by those
under investigation in this case

56:47.120 --> 56:51.520
to make and receive calls,
or send and receive messages.

56:52.080 --> 56:54.320
The level of detail in the information,

56:54.400 --> 56:57.960
from a technical point of view,
is relatively sparse.

56:59.440 --> 57:01.960
<i>The point is that</i>
<i>there is a lot more information</i>

57:02.040 --> 57:04.960
<i>that can be used</i>
<i>that could have been requested.</i>

57:05.480 --> 57:07.600
This surprised me

57:07.680 --> 57:11.080
because I would have expected
someone to have done this analysis.

57:11.600 --> 57:14.440
<i>We are technicians</i>
<i>in the telecommunications area</i>

57:14.520 --> 57:17.760
<i>and we work with data conservation</i>
<i>and telephone companies.</i>

57:17.840 --> 57:21.080
<i>What we do is provide reception,</i>
<i>check that everything is correct,</i>

57:21.160 --> 57:23.480
<i>that what's been requested is there</i>
<i>and is complete.</i>

57:23.560 --> 57:26.520
<i>We managed to do that.</i>
<i>We didn't carry out an analysis.</i>

57:26.600 --> 57:30.080
<i>Specifically, in this case,</i>
<i>there was no study of these calls.</i>

57:31.160 --> 57:32.920
<i>In 2009,</i>

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
<i>all the records that were missing and</i>
<i>were required for a more in-depth analysis</i>

57:38.080 --> 57:39.280
<i>already existed.</i>

57:40.080 --> 57:44.320
So, all that data was recorded
simply by the phone having a signal.

57:44.400 --> 57:46.600
It doesn't need to receive any messages,

57:46.680 --> 57:50.080
<i>receive any traffic,</i>
<i>receive any calls, or anything else.</i>

57:50.160 --> 57:52.320
<i>The phone just needs to be switched on.</i>

57:52.400 --> 57:55.560
<i>So, it's very important</i>
<i>to understand that with this data,</i>

57:55.640 --> 57:58.800
you'd be able to determine
the phone's location and any movements,

57:58.880 --> 58:01.320
simply because the phone was online.

58:01.960 --> 58:03.880
<i>Therefore, if, at any given moment,</i>

58:03.960 --> 58:07.840
<i>they moved location</i>
<i>to hide Marta's body somewhere,</i>

58:07.920 --> 58:12.560
<i>this recorded data would make it possible</i>
<i>to prove where they had been.</i>

58:12.640 --> 58:14.480
So, Manuel,

58:14.560 --> 58:17.120
if they moved and carried
their cell phones with them,

58:17.200 --> 58:19.080
would we be able to see that information?

58:19.160 --> 58:20.200
Yes.

58:21.240 --> 58:23.720
<i>But out of all those devices</i>
<i>used at the time,</i>

58:23.800 --> 58:27.520
<i>the only one that would be kept,</i>
<i>in theory, would be Miguel Carcaño's.</i>

58:27.600 --> 58:30.600
<i>It'd be with his personal effects,</i>
<i>kept by the prison,</i>

58:30.680 --> 58:33.080
<i>and it would be the last remaining device</i>

58:33.160 --> 58:37.360
<i>if the CDs containing the raw information</i>
<i>from the operators no longer exists.</i>

58:37.440 --> 58:40.800
That's where you could go
to look for this type of information,

58:40.880 --> 58:44.520
and it would have been very important
to have that from the beginning.

58:50.440 --> 58:53.280
COLLECTION OF PHONE DATA
FOR MARTA DEL CASTILLO'S MURDERER

58:53.800 --> 58:59.640
CARCAÑO'S PHONE TO BE COPIED TO KNOW
HIS MOVEMENTS THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME

59:01.360 --> 59:04.080
<i>Hi, I'm Paula,</i>
<i>the director of the documentary.</i>

59:04.160 --> 59:05.960
<i>How are you? I saw your message.</i>

59:06.040 --> 59:07.440
<i>Manuel, I wanted to tell you</i>

59:07.520 --> 59:11.320
<i>that they're going to give us</i>
<i>the CDs with the raw data</i>

59:11.400 --> 59:13.840
<i>and Miguel's cell phone for analysis.</i>

59:13.920 --> 59:16.640
<i>-Awesome! Let's go for it!</i>
<i>-We'll proceed!</i>

59:19.720 --> 59:22.400
We're going to focus
on one of the people involved,

59:22.480 --> 59:26.440
Francisco Javier,
Miguel Carcaño's brother.

59:26.520 --> 59:29.200
<i>Let's remember that he was acquitted</i>

59:29.280 --> 59:31.880
<i>as a collaborator in the crime.</i>

59:31.960 --> 59:35.320
It's an image from a security camera,

59:35.400 --> 59:37.760
recorded at the house

59:37.840 --> 59:40.840
where Francisco Javier's ex-wife,
Rosa, lives.

59:40.920 --> 59:43.840
That is to say, this footage
is from the security cameras

59:43.920 --> 59:47.920
at the house
where Miguel's brother's ex-wife lives.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.520
<i>The images are from the night</i>

59:50.600 --> 59:53.960
<i>that Marta del Castillo disappeared</i>
<i>and was murdered: January 24th.</i>

59:54.040 --> 59:58.760
And we are talking
about 8:57 at night. 8:57 p.m.

59:58.840 --> 1:00:02.680
<i>Here it is. The National Police</i>
<i>believe that this is Francisco Javier.</i>

1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:12.320
There are some images
from some security cameras.

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:15.000
If we could have seen them,
if the quality was better,

1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:17.120
what would we see in those images?

1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:20.600
Those images from the security camera...

1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:24.520
It's curious that
the time marker on the video

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.560
is exactly where they want to place me.

1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:29.720
<i>I left at 11:30 at night.</i>

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:32.360
<i>Where are the images for 11:30</i>

1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:37.240
<i>so that my real departure, 11:30,</i>
<i>can be compared</i>

1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:40.560
with where they want to place me,
which was at 9:00 p.m. or...

1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:41.840
I don't remember exactly.

1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:44.400
-So if those images existed--
-I insist.

1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:48.000
You'll see me leave at 11:30.
Not at 9:00 p.m.

1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:50.800
<i>But those images don't show up.</i>

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:54.080
<i>The ones from 9:00 p.m. show up,</i>
<i>but not the ones from 11:30 p.m.</i>

1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:01.120
IN VERSION SEVEN, MIGUEL SAYS HIS BROTHER
TOOK THE CAR FROM HIS EX-WIFE'S HOUSE

1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:04.680
DO YOU REMEMBER THE SECURITY CAMERAS
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD?

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:08.320
OF COURSE. THEY WERE REJECTED BY
THE COURT BECAUSE OF THEIR POOR QUALITY

1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:10.640
WELL, WE HAVE THEM.
ALL FOUR CAMERAS.

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:13.600
CAN WE ANALYZE THEM?

1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:21.120
The problem with the videos

1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:23.640
is that they have very little definition.

1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:28.520
<i>We've scanned the site</i>
<i>and we've obtained a 3D model of the site.</i>

1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:31.440
<i>We identified</i>
<i>each of the points in the image</i>

1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:34.400
<i>with the topographic points</i>
<i>that we've obtained.</i>

1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:37.520
<i>And we're getting an analysis</i>

1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:40.320
<i>that's a faithful representation</i>
<i>of what's in there.</i>

1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:43.720
<i>If he walked past these cameras,</i>

1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:47.960
<i>we'll have information on a person</i>
<i>with his physical characteristics</i>

1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:49.560
<i>who passed by at those times.</i>

1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:52.920
What were you wearing that day?

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.040
No idea.

1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:59.160
I mean... I don't know.

1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:01.400
Probably a black jacket.

1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:05.920
<i>-Hello, Marcos.</i>
<i>-Hi, Ricardo.</i>

1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.840
<i>Okay, tell me, what do we have?</i>

1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:11.080
<i>What we've discovered</i>
<i>is that there's a one-hour time lag.</i>

1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:13.800
<i>They were recording</i>
<i>in daylight savings time.</i>

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:14.960
<i>Do you mean</i>

1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:18.680
<i>all analyses that were carried out</i>
<i>of this CCTV footage, up until now,</i>

1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:21.520
<i>haven't taken this time lag into account?</i>
<i>They're wrong?</i>

1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:24.760
<i>Yes. I mean, they've been</i>
<i>looking at the wrong times.</i>

1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:28.880
<i>What do we have</i>
<i>in the time span that he's given us?</i>

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:32.920
<i>Arrival at around 9:00 p.m.</i>
<i>Departure at around 11:30 p.m.</i>

1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.080
<i>During the time span that he's given,</i>

1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:38.360
<i>at 8:40 p.m., which</i>
<i>is the correct time in the actual footage,</i>

1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:40.360
<i>or 9:40 p.m.,</i>
<i>the time that was documented,</i>

1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:42.280
<i>we see a person coming in.</i>

1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:43.880
<i>I'm watching it now.</i>

1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:47.320
<i>And then at 11:49 p.m.,</i>
<i>the correct time in the footage,</i>

1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:50.120
<i>a person dressed more or less</i>
<i>in the same way, leaving.</i>

1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:52.400
<i>-The one with the white bag, right?</i>
<i>-Indeed.</i>

1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:54.280
<i>So, the problem is that, as of today,</i>

1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:56.880
<i>with the logs we have</i>
<i>of his calls and locations,</i>

1:02:56.960 --> 1:02:58.000
<i>it doesn't make sense.</i>

1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:01.800
<i>Sure, he has to be</i>
<i>on León XIII Street at 8:41 p.m.,</i>

1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:05.240
<i>and at 11:45 p.m.,</i>
<i>he has to be at Dseda Bar.</i>

1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:08.360
<i>At midnight, he gets a call</i>
<i>from a location on Luis Montoto Street.</i>

1:03:08.440 --> 1:03:10.440
<i>The hours don't make sense.</i>

1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:12.120
LUIS MONTOTO STREET

1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:14.360
<i>Is there anyone who fits his description</i>

1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:17.320
<i>outside the times he's given</i>
<i>for his departure and arrival?</i>

1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:18.320
<i>Yes.</i>

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:20.360
REAL TIME: 9:04:08 p.m.

1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:22.000
<i>At 9:05 p.m., real time,</i>

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:23.920
<i>we have a figure that also matches</i>

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000
<i>the physical characteristics</i>
<i>of this person.</i>

1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:28.920
<i>They're dressed in black,</i>
<i>with a big coat, and so on.</i>

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.240
REAL TIME: 9:05:09 p.m.

1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:35.400
<i>At 11:30 p.m. you should see me leave,</i>
<i>not at 9:00 p.m.</i>

1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:02.000
SUNDAY JANUARY 24, 2021

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:05.560
<i>Today is January 24th, 2021.</i>

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:13.800
<i>Today is the anniversary</i>
<i>of Marta's disappearance,</i>

1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:16.680
<i>or her murder.</i>

1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:24.800
<i>Three weeks ago, a letter</i>
<i>was dropped in my father-in-law's mailbox.</i>

1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:29.840
<i>The letter is addressed to me</i>
<i>and it's anonymous,</i>

1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:32.400
<i>and it comes with a location</i>

1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:35.360
<i>that is absolutely possible,</i>
<i>reasonable and coherent.</i>

1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:38.240
<i>That's all it says.</i>

1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:44.720
<i>Why is it so important</i>
<i>to recover my daughter's body?</i>

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.440
I can't imagine
my daughter just lying somewhere.

1:04:55.160 --> 1:04:56.600
We have to know where she is,

1:04:57.920 --> 1:05:01.400
so that someday,
if we want to, we can take her flowers,

1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:04.720
but we can at least know where she is.

1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:10.400
<i>I can accept that she is dead, yes.</i>

1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:17.560
I was able to accept her death,

1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:20.960
before my husband could.
I don't know if my husband...

1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:23.480
<i>Even today, he might...</i>

1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:28.520
<i>Maybe he still hopes</i>
<i>that our little girl is alive somewhere.</i>

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.240
But I'm against the situation and...

1:05:33.080 --> 1:05:36.920
I get angry and I cry and...

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:41.360
I'm furious because I don't know
where she is.

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:56.000
<i>The idea of moving forward</i>
<i>is what keeps me going.</i>

1:05:56.960 --> 1:06:00.840
<i>Moving forward, searching,</i>
g<i>oing here and there and...</i>

1:06:02.320 --> 1:06:04.080
<i>And I'll continue doing this.</i>

1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:06.240
<i>I'll continue searching</i>

1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:10.120
and informing the police
if I consider any leads to be important.

1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:14.200
And if not, I'll look for her myself,
or I'll continue to look alone anyway.

1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:15.560
And, well...

1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:22.160
The kitchen window, to me,
is a very special frame.

1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:25.440
Because

1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:28.840
I used to look out
through that little space,

1:06:28.920 --> 1:06:32.040
through the kitchen window,
to see her coming,

1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:33.640
and I have her image in my mind.

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:40.200
And I hope that I never lose that image,

1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:43.360
because it's a way
of remembering my little girl.

1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:48.080
<i>The kitchen light stays on every day.</i>

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:53.360
For 12 years now, that light
has been on every single night.

1:06:54.680 --> 1:06:57.560
It's a beacon...

1:06:57.640 --> 1:06:59.080
leading her home.

1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:09.840
<i>Thanks t</i>o

1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:14.280

1:07:14.360 --> 1:07:17.880
<i>Among this evidence</i>

1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:20.960
