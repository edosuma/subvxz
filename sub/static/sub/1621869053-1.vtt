WEBVTT

01:12.114 --> 01:15.617
Two years have passed
since the arrival of the flagship

01:15.784 --> 01:20.581
and sending thousands of drones who
have devastated every country in the world

01:20.747 --> 01:22.749
and caused billions of deaths.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.253
But the real test was ahead.

01:26.712 --> 01:30.257
An invasion force determined to annihilate
what was left of humanity.

01:31.383 --> 01:33.927
Without a handful of brave,

01:34.094 --> 01:35.762
she would have succeeded.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.016
After the success of our response,

01:39.975 --> 01:43.729
aliens have joined us,
determined to end this war.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.024
But today,

01:47.232 --> 01:49.610
the vice tightens,
we are losing ground

01:49.776 --> 01:51.737
and let's suffer heavy losses.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.658
The worst is yet to come, I fear.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.415
Stop.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.294
Sometimes vows come true.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.722
Enter my office,
guy...

02:19.848 --> 02:21.225
and the girl.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.186
What I will show you,

02:24.353 --> 02:27.356
few people
know its existence.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.400
Even fewer have seen it before.

02:31.527 --> 02:36.156
It was discovered
at the bottom of the ocean in 1966.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.492
Then transferred here.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.703
Here is the Rainfall project.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.124
72 HOURS EARLIER

02:52.047 --> 02:54.925
Quiet,
it's just shrapnel.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.345
Group 3 tastes.
Secure the area.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.765
Hang on, group 3,
we're coming.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.574
We need to get them out of there.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.578
2nd section with me.
The others, on the left.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.836
Group 3, this is Sunray.
We're here.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.629
Get us out of here.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.929
Hide and shoot !

03:41.096 --> 03:42.639
Where are you going ?

03:42.806 --> 03:45.434
We have to pass
behind enemy lines.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.895
They've been scavenging us for two days.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.899
Go if you want, we'll get you covered.
But you're dead.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.790
Group 3 ?

04:13.170 --> 04:16.005
It's over, Sunray.
They got them.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.637
To all units,
mission compromised.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.224
Source approaching
from the western colony.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.227
Multiple victims
waiting for exfiltration.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.270
Whiskey 1, this is Drop Bear.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.190
Colony reached.
Ready to take action.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.942
All right, Drop Bear.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.193
Nice job.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.237
All we have is you.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.824
ALIEN COLONY
Western Sydney

05:09.184 --> 05:11.395
Hope it was worth it

05:12.479 --> 05:13.981
or you'll end up like your buddy.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.072
Whiskey 1, this is Drop Bear.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.448
The wolf is in the sheepfold.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.534
Drop Bear, you have the green light.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.953
PC to Zorro.

05:28.412 --> 05:29.788
Take action.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.626
Receipt, Whiskey 1. Let's go.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.011
Come on, come on !

05:53.353 --> 05:56.607
Give preference to ground targets.
Hunters with me.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.753
Shoot them !

06:18.879 --> 06:20.506
Traitors !

06:20.672 --> 06:21.840
Forward !

06:34.895 --> 06:38.065
Heavy fire.
Come on, Drop Bear.

06:45.989 --> 06:46.907
Come on !

07:15.394 --> 07:16.603
Whiskey 1.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.648
Group 1 approach to the target.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.483
Watch out for allied fire.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.093
Report on group 1.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.471
Mission accomplished,
the prisoners are free.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.472
I reserve you a bottle,
Drop Bear.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.558
PC to Zorro.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.683
Destroy this colony.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.813
Allied presence on site.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.690
It's an order.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.734
Our Grays are downstairs.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.277
Let go and go home.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.238
Receipt, Whiskey 1.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.556
SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA
834th day after invasion

09:20.561 --> 09:22.896
Take and make good use of it.

09:23.063 --> 09:23.814
I want one.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.818
Take and make good use of it.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.332
Grey sucker.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.127
I wish I was as cool as you.

09:45.711 --> 09:46.753
Come on, Amelia !

09:56.722 --> 09:58.891
You know what I'm missing, Amelia ?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.517
Chocolate ice cream.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.061
That was good.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.106
Straight under the arch.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.959
He's just a kid.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.295
He was spying on us.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.588
Pity.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.173
This technology

10:31.340 --> 10:32.716
is to those of my race.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.260
You found us.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.764
I did this to eat.
I'm starving.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.394
You remind me more and more
my ex-wife.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.355
Maternal instinct.

10:46.730 --> 10:47.940
And you look like him.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.149
Continue.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.671
Amelia the human is the first

11:10.838 --> 11:13.423
of its kind
to want to unite our two races.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.306
Our help in exchange for yours.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.975
How many are you ?

11:25.686 --> 11:27.271
He says they are 57.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.439
And how many...

11:29.606 --> 11:31.733
Warriors ? 14.

11:32.651 --> 11:35.654
12 valid.
More sick and children.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.281
Not bad. And for weapons...

11:37.447 --> 11:39.783
No weapons or food. We need it...

11:39.950 --> 11:42.452
Information, yes.
Amelia ?

11:43.078 --> 11:44.037
What?

11:44.454 --> 11:45.914
You're taking a long time.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.001
What do you know ?

11:53.881 --> 11:55.883
Something is brewing.

11:56.508 --> 11:57.843
The Kal'i.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.888
The protectors of the ancients.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.431
He's scared.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.809
The word Rainfall comes back.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.439
What's Rainfall ?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.524
Ask us to be evacuated.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.570
We're gonna get you out of here.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.585
RESISTANCE HQ
Sydney underground network

12:58.153 --> 12:59.154
Any news about Rainfall ?

12:59.321 --> 13:01.281
We're working on it, Colonel.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.408
- Sorry.
- Amelia, I'll be fine.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.662
What's up?

13:07.746 --> 13:08.622
Do you sleep better ?

13:09.414 --> 13:10.457
Sometimes.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.544
Sometimes I wake up screaming.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.129
Because of what they did to me.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.757
You saved us.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.301
You, Abraham... Matt.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.974
- Shit... Matt.
- It's long gone.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.685
No, it's really Matt.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.270
Suarez !

13:32.312 --> 13:33.605
Get this analyzed.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.693
Matthew, where did you get that ?

13:37.860 --> 13:39.361
Western colony yesterday.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.822
On a big beefy.
Mad, man.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.324
Bro.

13:45.576 --> 13:46.577
What's up?

13:47.327 --> 13:48.328
I'm smacked.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.955
Give it to me.

13:50.122 --> 13:51.206
You're dreaming, Garry.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.125
What's a Garry ?

13:53.292 --> 13:55.002
You look like a Garry.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.296
We met a Garry, didn't we ?

13:58.255 --> 14:00.799
He had a wife and kids.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.010
Your friends hit them all.

14:03.177 --> 14:05.053
I didn't kill that human.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.014
I also knew a Jackson.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.392
But you're not like him, Garry ?

14:10.934 --> 14:14.188
- My name is...
- And why not Ray ?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.064
It has a stingray face.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.528
Work on that, Garry.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.283
Let him call you Garry.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.535
You'll live longer.

14:30.287 --> 14:31.330
See you, Gazza.

15:05.364 --> 15:07.574
We contacted Europe

15:07.741 --> 15:11.787
and the United States
and they were hit very hard.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.998
They used nuclear weapons

15:15.791 --> 15:16.959
without success.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.170
No targets were hit.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.132
The situation is deteriorating

15:24.299 --> 15:27.719
with the arrival of a flagship
North Head.

15:27.886 --> 15:31.765
Greys combine colossal strength
in all directions

15:31.932 --> 15:34.184
and we take heavy damage.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.103
Sydney is lost.

15:36.687 --> 15:37.855
We are surrounded.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.774
I tell you frankly,
as a military man.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.444
We must evacuate
resistance fighters and civilians...

15:44.611 --> 15:46.822
We're still looking for some.

15:47.656 --> 15:50.951
There will be collateral losses
but the stakes...

15:51.118 --> 15:52.160
Commander.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.580
What's up there ?

15:54.746 --> 15:57.207
It is rare
to see someone again.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.627
We want to save people
but Hayes is right.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.922
Greys do not need drivers.
We do.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.340
Certainly.
Thank you, Robin.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.051
We defend the city

16:08.594 --> 16:11.013
for a year,
often successfully.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.849
500,000 Australians

16:14.266 --> 16:16.393
you must be alive.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.520
Let's not forget the others.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.648
Nor can we risk
the lives of our pilots.

16:21.815 --> 16:22.774
You have...

16:24.234 --> 16:25.194
You tried.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.446
Thank you.

16:27.613 --> 16:28.906
But I'll be frank.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.326
If you stay,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.119
it will be without air support.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.079
It's simple.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.835
Start the evacuation.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.421
Something else.

16:44.588 --> 16:48.300
Our sources mentioned
repeatedly an event,

16:48.467 --> 16:49.468
Rainfall.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.386
Is that new ?

16:52.429 --> 16:55.307
Did the Greys tell you that ?

16:55.474 --> 16:57.017
They are ready for anything.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.310
They are reliable.

16:58.477 --> 17:00.062
It doesn't exist...

17:01.855 --> 17:03.148
a reliable Gray.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.858
As for your opinion, I do without it.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.655
We know that Rainfall
appeared on the console

17:09.819 --> 17:11.865
that Matt got back.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.159
The only understandable word.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.743
Rainfall is the code name
from Pine Gap.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.415
An American base
in the center of the country.

17:20.582 --> 17:24.336
This helmet comes from a Kal'i,
the protectors of the ancients.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.964
If they are here,

17:27.130 --> 17:28.799
it's not for nothing.

17:31.343 --> 17:32.761
We need to know why.

17:32.928 --> 17:35.889
- Send a squad.
- It's suicide.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.683
The priority is evacuation.

17:37.850 --> 17:40.519
He's right, Abe.
It's gonna be hell here.

17:40.686 --> 17:44.523
The priority is to prevent Greys
to win the war.

17:44.690 --> 17:47.234
I need two volunteers

17:47.401 --> 17:49.903
to reach Pine Gap by road.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.363
I'll go.

17:54.825 --> 17:55.701
I'll go.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.494
Who else ?

17:57.661 --> 17:59.037
I'll go too.

17:59.538 --> 18:00.372
It's settled.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.459
You are not going to send this...

18:05.544 --> 18:07.087
He needs an interpreter.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.925
Let's start evacuating the refugees.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.386
Simmons, you go first
with Gray.

18:14.553 --> 18:15.804
Good luck to all.

18:18.682 --> 18:22.311
We all go to the same place.
Take the first transport.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.770
Do it for me.

18:23.937 --> 18:24.646
Sorry.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.857
That's why you love me.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.320
What is it you do?
I need you here.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.573
I was one of the first
to join you.

18:34.740 --> 18:37.242
Most of mine

18:37.409 --> 18:39.953
and yours wish for me to die.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.207
- That's right.
- If the Kal'i are here...

18:43.498 --> 18:45.501
I need to know why.

18:47.961 --> 18:48.837
Good luck.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.927
Never in life.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.888
You're a big boy.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.016
Show him who the boss is.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.560
These are Vox. There are few left.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.646
They are faithful and noble.

19:07.231 --> 19:08.148
Adorable.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.733
Don't be afraid, Matthew.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.486
As they say at home,
"Be a man."

19:12.653 --> 19:14.112
Repeat, Garry ?

19:15.697 --> 19:16.823
Repeat.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.242
Simmons.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.245
Sorry to stick this thing to you.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.412
I'll be fine.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.665
If he's smart...

19:26.583 --> 19:27.501
With that...

19:27.668 --> 19:30.170
- You'll be fine.
- I got mine, it's okay.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.297
We're never too careful.
A concern ?

19:35.175 --> 19:36.969
The colony yesterday.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.763
There were kids...

19:40.514 --> 19:41.849
Don't think about it.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.978
You followed my orders
and brought our guys back.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.606
There is more important.

19:50.649 --> 19:52.317
That's not all...

19:52.609 --> 19:53.944
Don't think about it anymore.

19:54.528 --> 19:58.323
Learn more about Rainfall
and contact me.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.284
Take it.

20:01.410 --> 20:02.327
Matthew.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.288
We have to go.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.042
Matt...

20:10.961 --> 20:12.838
Do not forget who the enemy is.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.175
At your command.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.238
Get to work, Romeo.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.199
Romeo ?

20:40.365 --> 20:41.575
Garry ?

20:41.742 --> 20:44.161
Why are you calling me that ?

20:44.328 --> 20:46.163
Cultural difference, eel head.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.124
The more shit we get,
the more we laugh.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.542
Not us.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.878
You'll end up having
the sense of humor.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.839
Or I'll kill you.

20:57.966 --> 21:00.385
You have to worry.

21:02.012 --> 21:02.763
Be careful.

21:05.682 --> 21:06.975
You too.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.269
Come back to us whole.

21:11.772 --> 21:13.357
Are you going to say goodbye to me ?

21:13.941 --> 21:15.484
You deal with the enemy

21:16.276 --> 21:17.694
while we fight.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.947
- And we die.
- Fuck you.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.991
Those who joined us
are tired of this war.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.494
And none of them would betray us ?

21:26.203 --> 21:28.497
I forgot... "Amelia the human".

21:29.081 --> 21:31.124
You never get it wrong, fortunately.

21:32.668 --> 21:33.961
On your way, Garry.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.176
She thinks only of you.

21:42.094 --> 21:43.428
That's your problem.

21:45.597 --> 21:46.431
Good luck.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.225
You too.

21:52.396 --> 21:55.691
Come on, let's go.
It's serious this time.

21:56.358 --> 21:59.069
Check vehicles
and the material.

22:00.279 --> 22:01.530
Activate weapons.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.661
It might shake a little,
so be vigilant.

22:10.205 --> 22:12.624
Stay discreet and attentive.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.254
You're used to it.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.382
Convoy !

22:24.386 --> 22:25.220
Start.

22:47.743 --> 22:50.204
Good evening,
I'm your captain.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.874
This transport is customized
and non-smoking.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.584
Unless we smoke aliens.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.471
Escort 1, we are on our way.

23:24.613 --> 23:26.323
- Good luck.
- See you.

23:33.038 --> 23:34.248
Here Simmons,

23:34.414 --> 23:36.583
Garry and the... rodent.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.584
We're ready.

23:38.544 --> 23:39.545
Bus ready.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.463
Support trimmed.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.590
Convoy ready.

23:43.924 --> 23:45.092
Open the doors.

24:10.868 --> 24:12.327
Let's go !

24:33.473 --> 24:34.725
We cut off the contact.

24:35.893 --> 24:36.935
One less.

24:45.694 --> 24:46.612
This is madness.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.488
We have to turn around.

24:50.616 --> 24:51.825
Probably not.

24:51.992 --> 24:53.410
Let's go.

24:59.416 --> 25:01.835
The convoy is enjoying.
Zorro and Blackbird,

25:02.002 --> 25:02.920
cover the convoy.

25:03.086 --> 25:06.048
- Well received.
- On your right.

25:06.215 --> 25:08.509
Get down and relieve them from the hunters.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.303
Blackbird, Harrier, Cobra,
divert.

25:11.470 --> 25:12.387
Received, Zorro.

25:13.805 --> 25:16.141
- Jets at 6 o'clock.
- Do your best.

25:22.105 --> 25:25.442
Garry, air targets at 2 o'clock.

25:29.363 --> 25:30.822
Come on, vermin !

25:43.377 --> 25:45.295
Tighten the vehicles.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.178
It seems that the flagship
took off.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.639
I'll take care of it.
Give me that.

25:56.181 --> 25:57.683
Suarez, are you okay ?

25:58.433 --> 25:59.977
There's nothing we can do for them.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.187
They're gonna be fine.

26:03.689 --> 26:04.982
Marcus is nowhere to be found.

26:22.249 --> 26:23.625
- Stay where you are.
- I'll help you.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.460
Stay where you are !

26:26.670 --> 26:28.338
Garry, protect the Vox.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.560
Watch the back !

26:46.064 --> 26:48.150
Everyone up front !

26:55.991 --> 26:57.284
Keep them busy.

26:58.744 --> 27:00.746
Get down.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.460
Zorro, answer !

27:06.627 --> 27:08.170
This is Zorro, who is it ?

27:08.337 --> 27:11.715
Robin, it's me.
Our bus is being candied.

27:13.175 --> 27:14.301
Hold on.

27:14.468 --> 27:16.428
It's now or never.

27:16.595 --> 27:17.763
Zorro, where are you going ?

27:26.021 --> 27:28.148
I need help,
I have one on me.

27:28.315 --> 27:29.316
I'm on it.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.159
Robin !

27:53.298 --> 27:54.383
She's my girl.

27:56.510 --> 27:57.845
Well done, Zorro.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.763
Thank you, Colonel.

28:00.222 --> 28:01.515
Idiot !

28:02.266 --> 28:03.934
Your sister's gonna be mad.

28:05.060 --> 28:05.936
Forget Amélia,

28:06.103 --> 28:08.689
I wasn't gonna leave you alone
in the face of danger.

28:09.314 --> 28:10.315
You have nothing to do here.

28:10.482 --> 28:14.444
There's nothing to do with it.
It's your lack of authority

28:14.611 --> 28:16.280
that endangers our mission.

28:16.446 --> 28:17.739
Don't get involved.

28:17.906 --> 28:18.782
Why not?

28:18.949 --> 28:23.161
The kid's probably a good shooter.
He is small and cunning as a Huzkit.

28:26.123 --> 28:27.791
He's going to join the convoy.

28:28.375 --> 28:31.670
This is Simmons.
Tell Amelia I have her brother.

28:32.254 --> 28:34.756
Alien troops
enter the base.

28:45.475 --> 28:48.687
Come on, speed up, come on !

28:48.854 --> 28:52.065
Follow the exit tunnel.
Drop it !

28:57.779 --> 28:58.572
What's up?

29:06.705 --> 29:09.833
Group 2 is retreating.
Hold that tunnel.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.293
Continue the evacuation.

29:11.460 --> 29:12.544
Forgiveness.

29:12.711 --> 29:14.296
Get on board, come on !

29:17.591 --> 29:18.800
We have to go, come on.

29:18.967 --> 29:21.053
We're waiting.
Humans first.

29:21.678 --> 29:23.388
These are the orders.

29:24.014 --> 29:25.140
Follow me.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.143
Let them through.

29:28.727 --> 29:31.480
- No, it's impossible.
- Whose order ?

29:31.647 --> 29:32.898
Colonel Hayes.

29:33.065 --> 29:34.650
It's anything.

29:38.737 --> 29:40.072
Come on, drive !

29:43.033 --> 29:45.202
Bailey, open the doors.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.344
Sydney doesn't want us to leave.

30:02.511 --> 30:05.305
Compromised integrity.
Speed up the evacuation.

30:05.472 --> 30:06.932
Hurry up.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.524
109, answer.

30:15.691 --> 30:17.860
Zero alpha, this is Bravo 109, to you.

30:18.026 --> 30:21.655
- Entering the atmosphere.
- Zero alpha, repeat.

30:21.822 --> 30:23.866
109,

30:24.032 --> 30:27.828
entry into the atmosphere
of an unknown object at high speed.

30:27.995 --> 30:30.455
From the flagship.

30:30.998 --> 30:32.207
Time is running out.

30:51.935 --> 30:55.022
Direction 208 east-southeast.

31:02.613 --> 31:03.864
Imminent impact.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.577
Hurry up.

31:18.545 --> 31:19.713
Come on, climb !

32:05.801 --> 32:08.011
Simmons, do you read me ?

32:09.680 --> 32:10.722
I'm listening.

32:11.765 --> 32:13.851
They destroyed Sydney.

32:16.103 --> 32:17.521
What part ?

32:18.230 --> 32:19.523
The whole city.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.150
They'll pay, Matt.

32:22.651 --> 32:24.152
Focus on your mission.

32:24.319 --> 32:26.321
Find out what Rainfall is.

32:26.989 --> 32:29.157
Stay out of occupied areas.

32:29.867 --> 32:31.410
We'll drop you off.

32:31.827 --> 32:32.828
Receive.

32:36.290 --> 32:38.083
Garry ? We're going down.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.919
Matt, serious,
you're not gonna leave me here ?

32:41.295 --> 32:42.921
It's less risky at three.

32:44.173 --> 32:45.632
Get your stuff.

32:46.425 --> 32:47.384
You're going up with him.

32:47.551 --> 32:48.635
Me ?

32:48.802 --> 32:51.471
That was your idea. Do you mind ?

32:51.638 --> 32:54.183
No, but still,

32:54.349 --> 32:56.018
you wouldn't care.

32:56.268 --> 32:57.686
He's learning fast.

33:30.677 --> 33:32.763
You make yourself at home, don't you ?

33:33.639 --> 33:36.767
I read stories
on what was once our planet.

33:36.934 --> 33:39.186
I guess she looked like that.

33:39.895 --> 33:41.939
Your planet is dead, so good...

33:42.773 --> 33:44.650
What are they doing ?

33:46.276 --> 33:47.444
I don't know.

34:05.504 --> 34:07.339
Will it always be like this ?

34:08.924 --> 34:12.094
Run away, fight, hide.

34:12.803 --> 34:14.179
Again and again.

34:14.888 --> 34:16.931
Until you're out of luck.

34:17.516 --> 34:19.935
Don't start doubting me.

34:24.606 --> 34:26.483
All this is fleeting.

34:27.818 --> 34:30.362
Humanity has been here for 200,000 years.

34:30.529 --> 34:32.406
We endured the glaciations,

34:32.697 --> 34:33.991
plague

34:34.867 --> 34:37.744
and the disco,
and we survived everything.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.915
Why did the Greys come here
what do you think ?

34:42.373 --> 34:45.335
We are the stars
of the Milky Way.

34:49.590 --> 34:53.677
BLUE MOUNTAINS
Military base

35:15.574 --> 35:16.658
Your attention.

35:18.160 --> 35:21.914
All staff involved
in operation Bayonet...

35:24.458 --> 35:26.793
All Grey
must be examined.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.837
Why?
Where are you taking them ?

35:29.004 --> 35:31.548
Simple security measure, sir.

35:31.715 --> 35:34.635
- They'll be treated well.
- It's better.

35:34.801 --> 35:36.637
They're on our side.
Follow them.

35:42.893 --> 35:44.770
Colonel Hayes wants to see you.

35:45.479 --> 35:49.066
This is Hayes.
We're in position 2.

35:50.734 --> 35:52.569
Are you going down to see ?

35:52.736 --> 35:56.823
There are thousands of refugees
terrified who want answers.

35:56.990 --> 35:59.076
My job,
it's about saving civilians.

35:59.243 --> 36:01.870
I asked you for an inventory.
Get to work !

36:02.621 --> 36:04.414
Tell yourself I'm your shepherd.

36:04.581 --> 36:06.083
We're not your sheep.

36:06.250 --> 36:07.918
That's for sure.

36:09.503 --> 36:12.297
You'll bring her back later
but for now,

36:13.257 --> 36:14.508
I have better things to do.

36:14.675 --> 36:15.801
Ah yes ?

36:15.968 --> 36:16.844
Get him out of here.

36:17.010 --> 36:18.387
Don't touch me.

36:21.807 --> 36:23.809
Thank God you are alive !

36:27.145 --> 36:28.522
- Good to see you.
- Me too.

36:28.689 --> 36:29.439
Is there a problem?

36:29.940 --> 36:32.484
Colonel Dickhead
is a big facho.

36:32.651 --> 36:35.404
He has his reasons, calm down.

36:35.737 --> 36:39.074
I love your natural optimism
to people.

36:40.075 --> 36:42.327
I'm going down to the civilians.

36:42.953 --> 36:44.538
Abe, how are you ?

36:49.751 --> 36:51.712
They messed us up.

36:56.049 --> 36:58.218
- But not killed.
- Indeed.

36:58.385 --> 36:59.887
Amelia.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.015
- Are you putting it back ?
- Of course.

37:04.099 --> 37:04.808
Welcome.

37:08.562 --> 37:11.148
You're gonna like what we did here.

37:13.025 --> 37:14.234
A titan's work.

37:14.985 --> 37:16.195
I'll show you around.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.281
Where are we?

37:19.448 --> 37:21.700
You should know,
this is your time.

37:22.576 --> 37:24.411
I was retired, not fossilized.

37:24.578 --> 37:26.788
It is a military complex
from the 50s

37:26.955 --> 37:29.499
improved by a team of researchers.

37:29.666 --> 37:31.126
A top secret project.

37:31.293 --> 37:33.337
It had been empty for 10 years.

37:33.504 --> 37:35.797
We settled down and fortified it.

37:35.964 --> 37:37.341
There's everything you need.

37:37.508 --> 37:40.719
Infirmaries, hydroelectric power stations.

37:40.886 --> 37:44.973
The colonel was at HQ
of the air force before the invasion.

37:45.516 --> 37:47.267
Behind a desk, I guess.

37:47.434 --> 37:49.811
Indeed, Miss Chambers.

37:51.188 --> 37:54.441
Strategic high command.
What are you implying ?

37:55.692 --> 37:58.779
I can't imagine a field man
let our allies down.

37:58.946 --> 38:01.323
That was never my intention.

38:01.490 --> 38:02.824
What is it ?

38:03.492 --> 38:05.994
He was ordering
to abandon our Greys in Sydney.

38:06.161 --> 38:07.162
That's the procedure.

38:07.746 --> 38:10.457
Procedure.
That's the way it is.

38:10.624 --> 38:12.167
It's very convenient.

38:12.334 --> 38:13.961
Essential personnel as a priority.

38:14.127 --> 38:16.713
You and I got off to a bad start.

38:18.757 --> 38:19.967
Follow me.

38:24.638 --> 38:26.390
Your attention.

38:27.140 --> 38:30.310
All vehicles must be inspected
before each patrol

38:30.477 --> 38:32.145
by order of the command.

38:40.988 --> 38:42.072
What are they doing ?

38:42.239 --> 38:43.740
They are preparing for war.

38:44.575 --> 38:48.495
What requires precision
and technical information transmitted...

38:49.121 --> 38:50.539
by the Greys.

38:51.456 --> 38:54.209
Their technology coupled with ours,
a real treat.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.923
Get down, quick !

39:09.141 --> 39:10.475
We have to help them.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.436
No, they're screwed.

39:15.439 --> 39:17.357
But this can be useful.

39:18.483 --> 39:19.443
Come.

39:20.277 --> 39:21.361
If we leave...

39:21.904 --> 39:22.905
They're dead.

39:25.741 --> 39:27.701
You and Garry, on the left.

39:27.868 --> 39:30.370
Me, right.
We take them in a vise.

39:30.537 --> 39:31.496
Let's go.

39:31.663 --> 39:32.831
Except that...

39:33.457 --> 39:36.627
you're getting busted
by the trackers in the tree.

39:36.793 --> 39:38.003
We're all dead.

39:38.295 --> 39:40.464
And Rainfall will remain an enigma.

39:40.631 --> 39:42.382
You must be smarter.

39:42.549 --> 39:45.511
- These are Kal'i devices.
- All the more reason to take them.

39:47.513 --> 39:50.974
I'll open fire
and attract their attention.

39:51.141 --> 39:52.184
What next ?

39:52.351 --> 39:53.727
We'll get you back.

39:53.894 --> 39:55.020
Garry ?

39:55.187 --> 39:57.314
Ensure the survival of the kid.

39:58.232 --> 39:59.983
And take them...

40:00.150 --> 40:01.693
In the back.

40:02.236 --> 40:03.820
If you like it.

40:04.696 --> 40:07.699
Let's get our gear
and let's be vigilant.

40:16.166 --> 40:17.501
Spin.

40:22.714 --> 40:24.258
Stay behind me.

40:24.424 --> 40:26.218
Why risk our skin ?

40:26.385 --> 40:27.928
We can question them.

40:28.095 --> 40:29.263
There are too many of them.

40:33.141 --> 40:35.269
Unless you have a better idea.

40:36.478 --> 40:37.980
I have one.

40:39.565 --> 40:40.566
He has one.

40:49.491 --> 40:51.159
What are you doing, Garry ?

40:54.079 --> 40:55.789
- That's stupid.
- Let him do it.

41:02.588 --> 41:04.506
And shit... Move !

41:15.893 --> 41:16.560
Get in !

41:29.823 --> 41:30.782
They're coming.

41:30.949 --> 41:33.160
I see them. Kal'i.

41:41.043 --> 41:42.127
Protect us, shoot !

41:48.467 --> 41:49.885
You're pissing, Garry.

41:56.099 --> 41:57.851
I had a good idea.

42:20.958 --> 42:21.959
Take them down.

42:36.598 --> 42:37.766
I got it.

43:32.529 --> 43:34.531
Offal this device.

43:47.002 --> 43:47.669
Fucking...

43:55.344 --> 43:56.303
Good.

44:11.276 --> 44:12.319
Good wind.

45:11.461 --> 45:12.921
They eat meat.

45:13.338 --> 45:15.299
They eat everything.

45:15.674 --> 45:17.676
I saw one eat a rock.

45:18.510 --> 45:20.512
They love metal.

45:20.846 --> 45:23.849
I told you they were faithful.

45:24.349 --> 45:26.268
Did you see I was on board ?

45:26.435 --> 45:27.227
Sorry.

45:27.394 --> 45:28.687
Lucky you're shooting bad.

45:30.063 --> 45:32.149
You got to chat with your friends

45:32.316 --> 45:33.775
and learn more ?

45:33.942 --> 45:35.777
I would have known more

45:35.944 --> 45:38.906
if you had not shot
on them... and me.

45:40.282 --> 45:41.700
Me finger slipped.

45:41.867 --> 45:44.661
Fortunately, you were
able to get away with it, vermin.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.538
Indeed.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.834
These Kal'i seek Rainfall
they too.

45:52.252 --> 45:53.795
It should slow them down.

46:33.043 --> 46:34.294
Insomnia ?

46:35.295 --> 46:36.672
So do I.

46:46.014 --> 46:47.850
How long did they keep you ?

46:48.350 --> 46:49.560
Six weeks.

46:56.608 --> 46:57.860
My wife was a nurse.

46:59.987 --> 47:03.490
She made nights
from 16 or 17 hours sometimes.

47:03.657 --> 47:06.577
It was driving me fucking crazy...

47:08.579 --> 47:11.665
She came in loose
and collapsed on the couch.

47:12.082 --> 47:13.584
But before that,

47:13.750 --> 47:16.295
I had to massage his feet.

47:18.630 --> 47:20.090
Katherine.

47:20.257 --> 47:21.675
Holy Katherine.

47:23.510 --> 47:25.554
She said " A beer and a burger,

47:25.721 --> 47:27.931
"these are the keys to paradise."

47:29.391 --> 47:30.726
Funny things

47:30.893 --> 47:32.603
keep it with you.

47:36.315 --> 47:38.609
I spent 9 months in this hellhole.

47:39.943 --> 47:41.486
With the crazy idea

47:41.653 --> 47:43.363
to find my wife.

47:44.364 --> 47:46.909
9 months to distort company

47:47.075 --> 47:49.995
to those dirty parasites...

47:50.787 --> 47:53.999
and get out of this nightmare.
When I found her...

47:58.712 --> 48:00.088
I didn't find her.

48:03.217 --> 48:06.345
What I found,
it wasn't my Katherine.

48:13.519 --> 48:14.895
Just des...

48:15.062 --> 48:16.772
pieces of her.

48:24.112 --> 48:25.572
His head.

48:27.449 --> 48:28.742
Her legs.

48:30.827 --> 48:32.120
His feet.

48:35.040 --> 48:38.418
I hear we were lucky
come out alive.

48:43.966 --> 48:45.592
I'm not sure.

48:46.301 --> 48:47.469
Colonel...

48:50.389 --> 48:52.307
My condolences.

49:00.482 --> 49:02.526
What do you think of Hayes ?

49:03.569 --> 49:04.319
It is reliable.

49:05.404 --> 49:07.906
Why did you take your head off with him ?

49:09.283 --> 49:10.325
Tell me.

49:14.746 --> 49:15.914
I'm suspicious.

49:17.958 --> 49:19.585
Stop looking for the fight.

49:19.751 --> 49:21.253
You're telling me that ?

49:21.587 --> 49:23.630
Hayes is on our side.

49:23.797 --> 49:25.924
He's a military genius.

49:29.887 --> 49:32.097
There are painkillers in the kit.

49:32.890 --> 49:34.975
Tell me if you need anything else.

49:54.995 --> 49:58.040
En route to Rainfall
Kal'i in our footsteps

50:03.003 --> 50:07.049
Receive. Stay the course
Next report in 10 hours

50:10.594 --> 50:13.388
Survivors in Sydney ?

50:15.599 --> 50:18.435
Negative.

50:56.014 --> 50:56.765
Garry ?

50:59.351 --> 51:01.061
Do they like chocolate ?

51:03.063 --> 51:03.897
Chocolate...

51:06.149 --> 51:07.901
Roasted cocoa beans

51:08.068 --> 51:10.279
and mixed with sugar.

51:11.780 --> 51:13.031
I'd say yes.

51:16.910 --> 51:19.246
Abraham would kill me
if he saw me.

51:21.832 --> 51:24.543
Wait your turn.
As long as they don't eat me...

51:24.710 --> 51:27.880
Probably not.
They seem to enjoy it.

51:28.046 --> 51:29.131
Probably not ?

51:29.381 --> 51:30.799
It's only us here.

51:30.966 --> 51:32.676
They'll have a hard time finding us.

51:32.843 --> 51:34.386
I'll call it Cadbury.

51:34.553 --> 51:37.097
No, that's how we tie ourselves.

51:37.264 --> 51:39.433
We'll get rid of it as soon as we can.

51:39.600 --> 51:40.893
They saved your life.

51:42.352 --> 51:43.228
I managed.

51:43.395 --> 51:44.897
That's right, yes.

51:45.731 --> 51:47.149
Make yourself useful.

51:47.316 --> 51:49.026
Fakes for you and me...

51:49.902 --> 51:51.403
and this thing for you.

51:52.237 --> 51:55.616
A mixture of Xandos and Zracion.

51:56.116 --> 51:57.743
Pravicor and Yalsa.

51:58.493 --> 52:00.412
Looks like pills
to get the gaul.

52:01.872 --> 52:04.166
- Gaul ?
- Drop it.

52:07.419 --> 52:08.837
A dictionary ?

52:09.171 --> 52:11.215
I'm trying to learn your language.

52:11.381 --> 52:14.134
Do you know a single word of mine ?

52:15.969 --> 52:17.429
Amelia gave it to me.

52:19.139 --> 52:20.974
I don't care about your tongue
and your race.

52:22.226 --> 52:23.602
I prefer humans.

52:24.436 --> 52:27.314
Those who follow me, I protect them.
Those who help me,

52:28.023 --> 52:29.191
I respect them.

52:30.400 --> 52:32.110
Those who face me...

52:33.445 --> 52:36.448
It's up to you to see where you stand
in the chain.

52:37.616 --> 52:38.784
Lie !

52:44.581 --> 52:45.707
What again ?

52:47.459 --> 52:48.293
Zylik.

52:50.045 --> 52:52.005
All right. What's Zylik ?

52:52.172 --> 52:53.882
A superpredator.

52:54.383 --> 52:56.051
You brought him here ?

52:56.218 --> 52:58.220
We brought everything we had left.

52:58.387 --> 52:59.638
Clueless.

53:00.138 --> 53:01.515
And what does it eat ?

53:01.807 --> 53:02.516
VOX.

53:02.683 --> 53:04.309
They love it.

53:05.477 --> 53:07.229
It's perfect.

53:07.396 --> 53:09.898
No, the situation is critical.

53:24.997 --> 53:26.373
Shit...

53:31.503 --> 53:32.504
Get out of here !

53:43.098 --> 53:44.057
Get out of here !

54:11.168 --> 54:12.044
Stand.

54:20.385 --> 54:21.887
Marcus, hide.

54:27.184 --> 54:28.435
He'll eat them.

54:28.602 --> 54:29.353
Whole.

54:33.524 --> 54:35.442
Go help Marcus.

54:37.778 --> 54:38.695
Marcus !

54:43.992 --> 54:45.661
Where's Rainfall ?

56:57.459 --> 56:59.044
Wake up, kid.

57:15.727 --> 57:16.854
Matt !

57:18.105 --> 57:19.690
That then...

57:30.033 --> 57:31.577
She won't know more.

57:31.743 --> 57:34.413
Where are all the Greys then ?
I've seen none.

57:34.580 --> 57:36.039
We'll be fixed soon.

57:44.006 --> 57:45.174
Forgiveness.

57:45.340 --> 57:46.675
You owe me dinner.

57:49.136 --> 57:50.179
Amelia...

57:51.388 --> 57:52.806
In what honor ?

57:53.348 --> 57:54.892
It's about the colonel.

57:55.684 --> 57:56.810
What, colonel ?

57:57.311 --> 57:58.312
He's a decorated veteran.

57:59.396 --> 58:02.441
I do not have access
to the Greys who accompanied us.

58:03.233 --> 58:05.194
I have a bad feeling.

58:06.695 --> 58:08.322
You want to know mine ?

58:08.697 --> 58:11.450
The Greys pounded the academy
as soon as they arrived.

58:11.617 --> 58:14.369
My mother. My father. My dog...

58:14.536 --> 58:15.704
Death.

58:16.163 --> 58:18.457
In my family,
we've been flying for 40 years.

58:19.333 --> 58:21.293
Hayes put me back in a cockpit.

58:22.044 --> 58:25.839
He is a father to us.
Thanks to him, we can fight back.

58:27.674 --> 58:30.177
We're not all
on a crusade for peace.

58:31.970 --> 58:33.263
I know.

58:34.806 --> 58:36.725
Choose your friends well.

58:37.059 --> 58:37.935
Baby...

58:39.144 --> 58:40.437
Robin !

58:40.938 --> 58:41.980
What now ?

58:48.487 --> 58:49.696
Are you sure of yourself ?

58:50.531 --> 58:52.241
They're hiding something.

58:54.660 --> 58:57.621
It pisses me off for making the pockets
from my girlfriend.

58:57.788 --> 58:59.456
If we go back, it's now.

58:59.748 --> 59:03.085
I hope I'm wrong
but I have to be sure.

59:06.672 --> 59:08.632
You have nothing to do here.
Stop !

59:08.799 --> 59:10.509
Turn around. Don't move.

59:11.218 --> 59:13.637
This area is off-limits to the public.

59:20.727 --> 59:23.105
- Where should you go ?
- I'm thinking.

59:23.564 --> 59:24.690
Block H.

59:25.941 --> 59:28.110
Far left at the end,
then to the right.

59:28.277 --> 59:29.695
The blue doors.

59:29.862 --> 59:31.238
Blue ?

59:31.697 --> 59:33.782
This area is prohibited...
Don't touch me.

59:33.949 --> 59:36.326
Get out !
Yes, the blue doors.

59:39.121 --> 59:40.747
ACCESS PROHIBITED
TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL

01:00:09.318 --> 01:00:10.986
I should go ahead.

01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:13.155
Tell Jacob.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.199
He'll understand.

01:00:15.782 --> 01:00:17.034
I doubt it.

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:26.251
Do you trust them ?

01:00:26.752 --> 01:00:27.753
Fully.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.881
Pete and Bella got into a fight
by my side.

01:00:33.467 --> 01:00:35.052
It's funny,
the Kal'i follow us everywhere.

01:00:35.844 --> 01:00:38.013
I don't find it fun.

01:00:38.555 --> 01:00:41.767
A Gray at HQ
must give them our position.

01:00:42.184 --> 01:00:43.644
A friend of yours ?

01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:46.730
You really believe
that it was one of mine ?

01:00:46.897 --> 01:00:49.483
I've often seen humans make deals.

01:00:51.151 --> 01:00:52.110
I saw you fight.

01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:55.030
You're hiding something from me.

01:00:55.781 --> 01:00:57.658
I'm a soldier, Matthew.

01:00:58.408 --> 01:00:59.701
Just like you.

01:01:17.511 --> 01:01:20.806
Rainfall, that's all we got.
And here we are.

01:01:20.973 --> 01:01:22.140
On a secret mission.

01:01:24.393 --> 01:01:25.310
What kind ?

01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:27.813
Peter, don't even think about it.

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:33.318
And you, in all this?

01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:38.490
I help Matthew

01:01:38.657 --> 01:01:40.033
in our mission.

01:01:40.742 --> 01:01:41.910
They told me about you.

01:01:44.162 --> 01:01:45.205
Who is that ?

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:47.499
Amelia the human.

01:01:49.585 --> 01:01:51.211
Is that his new nickname?

01:01:51.753 --> 01:01:53.005
How is she ?

01:02:05.601 --> 01:02:07.227
You are well installed.

01:02:07.394 --> 01:02:11.231
We wanted to hold each other
far from clashes.

01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:14.443
Others have joined us.

01:02:15.027 --> 01:02:16.000
And this village was born.

01:02:16.778 --> 01:02:17.779
On this subject...

01:02:20.741 --> 01:02:23.202
Out of respect for our neighbors ...

01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:26.205
I will give you back your weapons
starting.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.377
Thank you.

01:02:49.811 --> 01:02:51.313
Let's not hang around, Matthew.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.190
The Kal'i are following us.

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.150
They won't give up.

01:02:55.317 --> 01:02:57.653
Their radars
do not detect us.

01:02:57.819 --> 01:02:59.863
You see ? Calm down, Garry.

01:03:00.989 --> 01:03:02.950
- That's not my name.
- Yes, Garry.

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.327
Don't offend our host.

01:03:05.494 --> 01:03:07.538
You don't want to see Pete angry.

01:03:24.221 --> 01:03:25.597
I am dead ?

01:03:26.974 --> 01:03:28.058
Not yet.

01:03:28.725 --> 01:03:30.143
Dad and I found you.

01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:32.896
It's crazy, we haven't seen each other
since a year.

01:03:34.439 --> 01:03:35.607
You face monsters.

01:03:36.358 --> 01:03:37.609
We famine.

01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:38.902
I understand.

01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:41.989
I participated
at Sydney headquarters.

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:44.700
You will tell me.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.910
I will raise the pitfalls.
You come ?

01:03:49.371 --> 01:03:50.372
On the way.

01:04:43.926 --> 01:04:45.594
Dennis, can you hear me?

01:04:45.761 --> 01:04:47.471
Amelia, are you all right?

01:04:47.638 --> 01:04:51.058
They have the alien chemical weapon
that Matt had stolen.

01:04:51.225 --> 01:04:52.142
Why ?

01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:53.560
I dunno.

01:04:54.144 --> 01:04:55.604
Warn Abraham.

01:04:56.897 --> 01:04:57.731
Shit !

01:04:58.524 --> 01:04:59.942
You don't have to do anything there.

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.653
What are you doing ?
Open the door, get out!

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:05.322
Get out!

01:05:06.949 --> 01:05:08.200
Amelia.

01:06:01.628 --> 01:06:03.589
Amelia told me
that you did

01:06:04.089 --> 01:06:07.092
to one of mine
that you captured.

01:06:21.356 --> 01:06:22.816
I smashed his head.

01:06:28.947 --> 01:06:32.326
It was a dark time
for all of us.

01:06:34.661 --> 01:06:36.538
I'm not proud of it.

01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:38.498
It was a dark time.

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:40.501
The light...

01:06:41.376 --> 01:06:42.920
came from Amelia.

01:06:54.515 --> 01:06:56.183
Did she spare you?

01:06:57.893 --> 01:07:00.437
She forgave me.

01:07:09.863 --> 01:07:11.740
I'll get you out.

01:07:11.907 --> 01:07:13.242
She's there.

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:14.409
Someone is coming.

01:07:56.994 --> 01:07:58.370
Everything went into a spin.

01:07:59.121 --> 01:08:00.330
Amelia ...

01:08:00.497 --> 01:08:01.874
this war...

01:08:04.585 --> 01:08:06.253
Why am I fighting at the bottom?

01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:09.131
What happened to you ?

01:08:10.174 --> 01:08:12.426
The Grays wanted to talk with Amelia

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:14.720
to evoke a truce.

01:08:15.804 --> 01:08:16.889
It stank.

01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:18.765
I felt it bad but hey,

01:08:18.932 --> 01:08:21.268
she made an alliance
after all.

01:08:22.769 --> 01:08:24.938
We are all there, around the table,

01:08:25.104 --> 01:08:26.773
and an alien kid approaches.

01:08:27.482 --> 01:08:30.359
She is holding a basket
of plastic flowers.

01:08:34.198 --> 01:08:36.867
They didn't even wait
that she comes out.

01:08:38.743 --> 01:08:40.120
One of their kids.

01:08:41.121 --> 01:08:42.997
I was between Amelia and the detonation.

01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.876
From where my mouth of candle.

01:08:47.752 --> 01:08:49.296
It improves your profile.

01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:53.091
Sophisticated stuff.

01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:55.594
Designed to do maximum damage.

01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:59.264
And she dares to ask
what we did wrong.

01:09:19.326 --> 01:09:20.911
What is happening ?

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.792
We're here for the alien.

01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:28.167
Hang him!

01:09:33.048 --> 01:09:34.424
No way, Jacob.

01:09:35.466 --> 01:09:37.094
You harbor an enemy.

01:09:37.636 --> 01:09:38.636
You know the rules.

01:09:38.804 --> 01:09:40.805
I wrote them with you.

01:09:41.348 --> 01:09:43.767
He is a member of the resistance
on a mission.

01:09:44.268 --> 01:09:47.229
Deliver it to us
and we leave you alone.

01:09:47.938 --> 01:09:49.314
Cadbury!

01:09:51.191 --> 01:09:52.734
The Vox need me.

01:09:58.407 --> 01:09:59.241
Stand back!

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.664
They didn't do anything to you,
go away !

01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:15.007
Bring out that vermin.

01:10:15.841 --> 01:10:18.343
I won't deliver it to you.

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:20.137
He is my guest.

01:10:20.679 --> 01:10:21.513
Go home.

01:10:22.806 --> 01:10:24.141
Go!

01:10:24.641 --> 01:10:26.226
I'm sorry, Peter.

01:10:27.102 --> 01:10:29.062
You leave us no choice.

01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:30.939
Show yourself, dirt!

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.735
Treat Peter and his household
respectfully.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.780
But go get me that vermin!

01:10:45.495 --> 01:10:48.582
Stay away from this house.

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:53.921
It's not after these humans
that you have.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.423
But after me.

01:10:57.883 --> 01:10:59.051
The alien!

01:11:00.677 --> 01:11:02.763
Marcus, stay here.

01:11:04.473 --> 01:11:05.974
How are you guys?

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:08.727
I don't want bloodshed.

01:11:10.062 --> 01:11:11.939
But if you want me,

01:11:13.565 --> 01:11:15.275
Come get me.

01:11:18.403 --> 01:11:20.697
Try your luck.

01:11:27.579 --> 01:11:28.956
Catch it!

01:11:38.632 --> 01:11:40.217
Catch it, come on!

01:11:43.011 --> 01:11:43.679
Go!

01:12:02.114 --> 01:12:03.156
Let go of it.

01:12:12.249 --> 01:12:13.458
Release it.

01:12:14.543 --> 01:12:15.252
Come on.

01:12:16.837 --> 01:12:19.214
The first one who stares at him
eat a ball.

01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:20.340
Okay with you ?

01:12:20.507 --> 01:12:24.011
He's coming with us.
You won't see them again.

01:12:24.178 --> 01:12:26.013
You have my word.

01:12:27.639 --> 01:12:28.849
If I see him again ...

01:12:30.058 --> 01:12:31.476
he is dead.

01:12:32.686 --> 01:12:34.688
You won't see him again.

01:12:35.647 --> 01:12:37.399
Upon my return
we will have to discuss.

01:12:39.443 --> 01:12:41.820
Get over now.

01:12:41.987 --> 01:12:43.113
Go home.

01:12:45.365 --> 01:12:46.491
Let's go.

01:12:51.914 --> 01:12:52.915
You need help

01:12:53.749 --> 01:12:55.375
to carry out your mission.

01:12:56.919 --> 01:12:58.629
I have fled this war enough.

01:12:59.796 --> 01:13:01.006
Me too.

01:13:02.007 --> 01:13:04.635
If necessary, call the cavalry.

01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:07.888
You are surprising.

01:13:08.055 --> 01:13:09.848
Don't get carried away, I'm drunk.

01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:16.230
Are you okay, Garry?

01:13:20.817 --> 01:13:22.361
You are burned out, you.

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:24.530
Do you understand the meaning?

01:13:25.864 --> 01:13:26.865
Let's go home.

01:13:45.467 --> 01:13:47.386
Put yourself in the head

01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:49.680
that war is dirty

01:13:49.847 --> 01:13:51.223
and it's wild.

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:53.851
There is no magic wand
diplomatic.

01:13:56.144 --> 01:13:59.565
You're screwed, Hayes.
I have seen everything.

01:14:01.066 --> 01:14:04.069
Buckle it up
in a cell in the basement.

01:14:04.528 --> 01:14:06.655
- I don't need her.
- We do.

01:14:08.156 --> 01:14:09.032
Abe.

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:10.951
Watch your kids.

01:14:11.618 --> 01:14:13.287
They kill all the Grays.

01:14:13.453 --> 01:14:15.581
Tortures, experiences ...

01:14:15.914 --> 01:14:17.082
By the hundreds.

01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:19.626
It's a monster.

01:14:23.839 --> 01:14:24.882
Charles?

01:14:26.341 --> 01:14:27.426
Explain yourself.

01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:29.011
Why not.

01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:32.848
The Grays outclass us
in any case.

01:14:33.015 --> 01:14:34.433
You have to be merciless,

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:38.395
even if it means sacrificing some
to find a weak point.

01:14:38.812 --> 01:14:40.189
You talk about extermination.

01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:44.276
You ignore the effects
that would have an alien chemical weapon.

01:14:45.194 --> 01:14:47.404
It's called a tactical advantage.

01:14:47.988 --> 01:14:49.907
A tactical advantage.

01:14:50.532 --> 01:14:51.950
Listen to me carefully.

01:14:52.117 --> 01:14:54.536
All of you, listen to me.

01:14:56.872 --> 01:14:59.625
With our world shattered,
it is our hopes that have vanished.

01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:02.002
I'm aware of it, Charles.

01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:04.087
But our strength ...

01:15:04.588 --> 01:15:07.758
What defines our species,

01:15:08.425 --> 01:15:09.968
it's not to fall

01:15:10.135 --> 01:15:13.597
but to get up,
every time, again and again.

01:15:14.723 --> 01:15:15.599
You're welcome.

01:15:17.684 --> 01:15:21.438
We are not going to sacrifice
this occasion

01:15:21.605 --> 01:15:22.940
on a whim.

01:15:23.649 --> 01:15:25.025
It's too late.

01:15:26.026 --> 01:15:26.693
Why ?

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.238
Because they follow us
from Sydney.

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:31.657
Their ships are approaching.

01:15:31.823 --> 01:15:34.117
We are going on the offensive.

01:15:34.868 --> 01:15:37.037
This weapon will not make any distinction.

01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:39.957
All the Grays will be wiped out,
it will be genocide.

01:15:40.123 --> 01:15:42.501
Is there a single reliable one?

01:15:43.502 --> 01:15:45.921
The Grays who joined the resistance,

01:15:46.088 --> 01:15:49.007
their help was invaluable.
Garry, Vidargh ...

01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:52.469
They are worth nothing
not today nor tomorrow.

01:15:52.636 --> 01:15:53.595
Not like us.

01:15:53.762 --> 01:15:56.431
Charles, you are a good man.

01:15:59.226 --> 01:16:00.644
Another way is possible.

01:16:00.811 --> 01:16:01.937
We always have the choice.

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:05.732
That is true.

01:16:06.942 --> 01:16:08.485
Who is with me ?

01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:11.864
Dennis, help me.

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:16.451
No.

01:16:16.618 --> 01:16:18.161
Not like this.

01:16:18.662 --> 01:16:19.496
Like what ?

01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:22.583
Colonel, you are under arrest.

01:16:25.878 --> 01:16:26.920
Don't try anything.

01:16:28.172 --> 01:16:29.882
It's grotesque.

01:16:31.091 --> 01:16:32.301
You have no authority.

01:16:32.467 --> 01:16:33.802
The enemy is upon us

01:16:33.969 --> 01:16:37.556
and whether you like it or not,
this weapon is the solution.

01:16:38.473 --> 01:16:41.727
Captain Bailey,
please disarm the colonel.

01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:43.729
Lower your gun.

01:16:49.067 --> 01:16:50.277
I fall badly?

01:16:50.444 --> 01:16:51.987
Captain Wessex.

01:16:52.905 --> 01:16:54.781
Disarm them or open fire.

01:16:54.948 --> 01:16:56.992
- Captain Bailey.
- Wessex.

01:16:57.159 --> 01:17:00.078
Wessex, Hayes wants to commit
genocide.

01:17:00.245 --> 01:17:02.539
Disarm the colonel immediately.

01:17:02.706 --> 01:17:05.626
We're gonna lose this war
do you get it?

01:17:05.792 --> 01:17:07.628
We are going to lose.

01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:11.256
Wessex, you are a soldier.
Do your duty.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.383
Believe me, he is wrong.

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:15.010
Captain Wessex.

01:17:19.515 --> 01:17:21.099
Colonel Hayes.

01:17:23.018 --> 01:17:25.354
You are under arrest.
Tie them up.

01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:26.647
Get down.

01:17:26.813 --> 01:17:28.857
On the ground, at speed.

01:17:30.817 --> 01:17:32.319
On your knees.

01:17:38.575 --> 01:17:39.868
Do not move.

01:17:40.536 --> 01:17:42.746
The enemy ships.
They are there.

01:17:57.052 --> 01:17:58.053
Fall back!

01:18:14.444 --> 01:18:15.445
She suffered.

01:18:16.488 --> 01:18:17.823
But not recently.

01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:19.825
First assault, no doubt.

01:18:20.742 --> 01:18:22.578
No sign of life.

01:18:22.744 --> 01:18:24.705
We sowed the Kal'i.

01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:26.999
They are still following us.

01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:28.542
They never give up.

01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:34.131
Either way, you have to go.

01:18:44.099 --> 01:18:47.269
PINE GAP
American military base

01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:29.311
We have a concern.

01:19:30.062 --> 01:19:32.814
I need a drink.

01:19:35.442 --> 01:19:38.612
Help me, Vodka Kenobi,
you are my only hope.

01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:43.492
Open the fridge, Hal.

01:19:43.659 --> 01:19:46.787
Open that fridge, Mr. Gorbachev.

01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:50.541
I told you so,

01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:52.751
you don't hold the alcohol.

01:19:52.918 --> 01:19:55.087
Thank you dear audience.
And boom !

01:19:58.549 --> 01:20:00.092
What is that ?

01:20:00.259 --> 01:20:02.427
Stop saying "Et bim"!

01:20:02.594 --> 01:20:05.931
You are not credible.
Be content with silly sound effects.

01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:07.641
Shit.

01:20:09.184 --> 01:20:10.435
We are peaceful.

01:20:10.602 --> 01:20:12.938
We don't want any problem.

01:20:13.105 --> 01:20:14.064
Who are you ?

01:20:16.608 --> 01:20:18.694
I will return the question to you.

01:20:20.237 --> 01:20:21.238
I asked first.

01:20:21.905 --> 01:20:22.781
It's just.

01:20:24.616 --> 01:20:27.828
My name is Bud Miller
and we are ready to cooperate.

01:20:27.995 --> 01:20:29.705
On the other hand...

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.707
it's Steven.

01:20:31.874 --> 01:20:33.750
Hi, it's Steve.

01:20:33.917 --> 01:20:36.086
I'm not sure I want to cooperate.

01:20:36.253 --> 01:20:38.589
- Yes, we cooperate.
- OK, I'm cooperating.

01:20:38.755 --> 01:20:40.132
Steve is a dumb name.

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:41.967
Is not it ?

01:20:43.177 --> 01:20:44.303
If you say so, Garry.

01:20:45.846 --> 01:20:47.139
OK ... Bud.

01:20:48.891 --> 01:20:50.601
- Where did you come from?
- He freed me.

01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:53.979
Don't say it like that.
I ... released him.

01:20:54.146 --> 01:20:56.148
That's what I said.

01:20:56.315 --> 01:20:57.858
Did our guys drive you here?

01:20:58.525 --> 01:20:59.568
No.

01:20:59.735 --> 01:21:03.488
Only one could have
go get help but no,

01:21:03.655 --> 01:21:05.574
they are all gone.

01:21:05.741 --> 01:21:07.034
Are you okay doll?

01:21:08.702 --> 01:21:10.746
Have you ever hit an alien?

01:21:11.955 --> 01:21:13.916
I have needs, I can't help it.

01:21:14.082 --> 01:21:16.877
You don't want to do a little housework
that it is operational.

01:21:17.044 --> 01:21:18.253
Help me, what!

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.505
- I help you.
- How? 'Or' What ?

01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:21.381
I'm taking out the trash.

01:21:21.548 --> 01:21:24.593
You throw the bag
in the launch silo.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.679
I made this
to protect us from aliens!

01:21:27.846 --> 01:21:31.517
And I, I have to take care of you
when you have a hives attack.

01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:34.102
My hives?
Are you going to do this again?

01:21:34.269 --> 01:21:36.271
Yeah, you almost choked again

01:21:36.438 --> 01:21:38.357
while eating pistachios.

01:21:38.524 --> 01:21:40.609
You know

01:21:40.776 --> 01:21:43.070
but you continue to eat it.

01:21:43.237 --> 01:21:44.863
Because it's so good!

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:46.198
Shut up.

01:21:48.325 --> 01:21:51.620
We didn't come here
to listen to you bawl.

01:21:51.787 --> 01:21:54.540
- He only knows how to do that.
- Stop whispering.

01:21:54.706 --> 01:21:57.167
I put up with this bullshit
for two years.

01:21:57.876 --> 01:22:00.587
Blow him up the caisson.

01:22:00.754 --> 01:22:01.713
Or mine.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.632
Good idea, that.

01:22:04.758 --> 01:22:05.759
Rainfall?

01:22:05.926 --> 01:22:07.636
That's all we know.

01:22:07.803 --> 01:22:09.012
Code name Rainfall.

01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:10.264
Where are we going ?

01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:12.015
Me, in the bathroom.

01:22:12.182 --> 01:22:13.809
It was you who followed me.

01:22:14.476 --> 01:22:18.730
This is the name of the base.
Pine Gap, Rainfall. Be more specific.

01:22:18.897 --> 01:22:21.358
That's all we know.

01:22:22.067 --> 01:22:23.068
Garry.

01:22:24.444 --> 01:22:26.738
There can only be one left.

01:22:27.698 --> 01:22:28.907
Am I too painful?

01:22:30.993 --> 01:22:32.995
You must know well

01:22:33.161 --> 01:22:34.746
what interests them here.

01:22:34.913 --> 01:22:36.915
You are the Americans, damn it!

01:22:37.082 --> 01:22:40.294
There are no more Americans.
I'm all alone.

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.005
And him ?
Maybe that's what they want.

01:22:43.172 --> 01:22:44.381
Put that down.

01:22:45.048 --> 01:22:46.842
You don't know what it is.

01:22:47.009 --> 01:22:49.595
From now on, do not touch anything.

01:22:49.761 --> 01:22:52.556
It can explode just by ...

01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:54.725
It's Steve's night light.

01:22:54.892 --> 01:22:56.351
You can keep it.

01:22:56.852 --> 01:23:00.189
Who would be after Steve?
Look at the.

01:23:00.355 --> 01:23:01.857
He's a moron.

01:23:02.024 --> 01:23:05.235
He's a scout
which crashed on Earth.

01:23:05.402 --> 01:23:07.112
They kicked him out of Roswell.

01:23:07.279 --> 01:23:09.907
There is nothing here, absolutely nothing,

01:23:10.073 --> 01:23:11.575
that is useful to you.

01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:13.619
OK, follow me.

01:23:14.328 --> 01:23:15.871
Alright, guys.

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:17.372
Sorry.

01:23:17.623 --> 01:23:19.333
Are we having a movie, Garry?

01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:22.294
Bud is upset.

01:23:22.461 --> 01:23:23.795
Shut up, Steven.

01:23:23.962 --> 01:23:25.005
It's Steve.

01:23:25.339 --> 01:23:26.798
Take that mustache off.

01:23:26.965 --> 01:23:28.175
I grow it.

01:23:28.342 --> 01:23:29.426
Dumbass !

01:23:30.177 --> 01:23:31.720
You are mean.

01:23:35.057 --> 01:23:36.517
Get back to your devices.

01:23:36.683 --> 01:23:39.311
We must retain them as much as possible.

01:23:39.478 --> 01:23:42.147
Dennis, start the evacuation.

01:23:42.314 --> 01:23:44.358
You are making a huge mistake, Abe.

01:23:44.525 --> 01:23:46.276
You are at the pickup.

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.946
Return to your posts, obey!

01:23:49.112 --> 01:23:50.656
The soldiers...

01:23:52.908 --> 01:23:54.159
What now ?

01:23:55.494 --> 01:23:57.829
No one is listening to you anymore, Hayes.

01:23:58.372 --> 01:24:01.625
They'll listen to me when we've lost
because of you.

01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:05.128
We will see what history will remember.

01:24:07.589 --> 01:24:09.174
Outpost, do you receive me?

01:24:10.008 --> 01:24:12.010
Zorro, do you see me?

01:24:12.761 --> 01:24:13.720
No pilot responds.

01:24:14.888 --> 01:24:16.098
You said ?

01:24:16.265 --> 01:24:18.475
The aliens take control.

01:24:21.562 --> 01:24:22.855
You are surrounded.

01:24:24.773 --> 01:24:27.442
Your victory is impossible.

01:24:27.609 --> 01:24:30.612
We will spare you
if you send

01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:33.448
Amelia the human face us.

01:24:34.199 --> 01:24:35.701
Obey

01:24:35.868 --> 01:24:37.411
or you will die.

01:24:40.706 --> 01:24:43.625
Amelia ... you don't have to.

01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:46.753
Yes.

01:25:01.643 --> 01:25:02.853
Hold on.

01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:15.407
You are crazy.

01:25:32.049 --> 01:25:33.509
Are you ready, soldier?

01:25:34.843 --> 01:25:36.470
Hold the position.

01:25:49.441 --> 01:25:50.651
You receive me ?

01:25:51.151 --> 01:25:51.985
Affirmative.

01:26:29.231 --> 01:26:31.024
You're going to get there, Amelia.

01:26:39.449 --> 01:26:41.702
I feel like Custer
facing the Indians.

01:26:41.869 --> 01:26:43.078
You see ?

01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:45.747
Affirmative, we have the image.

01:26:47.875 --> 01:26:48.917
Do not move.

01:26:55.299 --> 01:26:56.925
Good game.

01:27:24.578 --> 01:27:25.537
So ?

01:27:46.099 --> 01:27:48.435
Amelia the human ...

01:27:48.602 --> 01:27:49.978
you had the courage

01:27:50.145 --> 01:27:52.940
to leave your fortress.

01:27:53.106 --> 01:27:56.318
You are worthy
to command your people.

01:27:56.485 --> 01:27:57.528
I do not order.

01:27:57.694 --> 01:27:59.821
This is how you are known.

01:27:59.988 --> 01:28:02.491
Many of mine have betrayed

01:28:02.658 --> 01:28:03.492
in your name.

01:28:03.659 --> 01:28:05.202
I came to negotiate.

01:28:06.119 --> 01:28:07.496
I already tried.

01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:10.499
Our species has lost hope.

01:28:10.666 --> 01:28:12.209
Our world is no more.

01:28:12.376 --> 01:28:15.587
We came here
to start all over again.

01:28:15.754 --> 01:28:16.839
Many have died.

01:28:17.005 --> 01:28:19.800
I am one of the elders,
it is my responsibility.

01:28:19.967 --> 01:28:20.801
I know.

01:28:21.552 --> 01:28:23.053
Our peoples have suffered enough.

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:26.390
Your race
is an evolutionary accident ...

01:28:27.015 --> 01:28:28.767
but endowed with great strength.

01:28:29.351 --> 01:28:33.146
Sacrifices are necessary.
This war must end

01:28:33.313 --> 01:28:35.107
or I will be held responsible.

01:28:35.274 --> 01:28:37.234
If we can't make peace,

01:28:38.402 --> 01:28:40.487
there will be no more planet
to share.

01:28:44.199 --> 01:28:45.617
Let us act together.

01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:48.871
I know what atrocities

01:28:49.037 --> 01:28:51.415
are committed on my fellows

01:28:51.582 --> 01:28:53.292
by your accomplices

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.836
who hide out of fear and shame.

01:28:56.003 --> 01:29:00.007
May you be an example
for your people.

01:29:00.174 --> 01:29:01.383
You are their leader.

01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:03.135
And you will die.

01:29:11.226 --> 01:29:12.144
Run, Amelia.

01:29:16.106 --> 01:29:17.107
Classes !

01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:19.526
Fire!

01:29:27.659 --> 01:29:29.494
Kill them all.

01:29:50.224 --> 01:29:52.226
You have to know where Dennis is.

01:29:52.684 --> 01:29:54.269
Contact the squadron leader.

01:29:54.436 --> 01:29:56.897
We must hold out until evacuation.

01:29:57.064 --> 01:29:58.148
We are active!

01:30:00.317 --> 01:30:01.527
Last chance.

01:30:01.693 --> 01:30:04.363
Join me or you will die here.

01:30:07.282 --> 01:30:08.909
I know what you went through.

01:30:09.076 --> 01:30:10.702
I am like you.

01:30:11.703 --> 01:30:12.871
Do not do that.

01:30:14.831 --> 01:30:17.501
I did not escape them
to die here.

01:30:18.377 --> 01:30:19.294
Lieutenant,

01:30:19.461 --> 01:30:21.797
ship the toxin
on the remaining devices

01:30:21.964 --> 01:30:23.382
and make them take off.

01:30:24.424 --> 01:30:25.801
Others...

01:30:28.971 --> 01:30:30.556
get back to work.

01:30:38.188 --> 01:30:40.023
Imminent attack.

01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:44.611
All civilian personnel
must join the lower levels.

01:30:47.447 --> 01:30:49.074
We're going to get out of here.

01:30:49.241 --> 01:30:51.076
By there, stay together

01:30:51.243 --> 01:30:53.370
and close ranks, come on!

01:31:05.007 --> 01:31:07.176
20 minutes before incursion.

01:31:16.852 --> 01:31:17.936
Beauty,

01:31:18.103 --> 01:31:19.563
you must not stay there.

01:31:22.482 --> 01:31:23.358
Abe ...

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.904
Hayes freed himself,
it will release the toxin.

01:31:27.487 --> 01:31:29.489
Do you think Abraham would want that?

01:31:30.032 --> 01:31:31.533
Amelia, look at me!

01:31:34.369 --> 01:31:34.995
I am with you.

01:31:36.079 --> 01:31:37.247
I am with you.

01:31:45.422 --> 01:31:46.423
Stop.

01:31:49.301 --> 01:31:50.928
Sometimes wishes come true.

01:31:55.307 --> 01:31:57.142
I installed the lamps myself.

01:31:57.476 --> 01:31:59.561
Come into my office, guys ...

01:32:00.729 --> 01:32:01.730
and the girl.

01:32:01.897 --> 01:32:03.857
What I'm going to show you,

01:32:04.024 --> 01:32:06.610
few people
know it exists.

01:32:06.777 --> 01:32:09.279
Even fewer have ever seen it.

01:32:09.446 --> 01:32:11.448
According to the National Security ...

01:32:11.615 --> 01:32:14.159
You can stop
to make crates?

01:32:14.326 --> 01:32:16.537
You allow ?
People are counting on us.

01:32:16.703 --> 01:32:19.331
I'm just trying
to make you understood ...

01:32:19.498 --> 01:32:22.417
Drop,
you don't deserve the talk.

01:32:22.584 --> 01:32:23.502
Steven?

01:32:26.046 --> 01:32:27.005
Thank you.

01:32:34.888 --> 01:32:36.598
- And boom !
- Stylish.

01:32:59.454 --> 01:33:01.999
It was discovered at the
bottom of the ocean

01:33:02.165 --> 01:33:03.625
in 1966.

01:33:03.792 --> 01:33:07.671
Then transferred here,
where no one would come looking for it.

01:33:07.838 --> 01:33:09.256
Pine Gap.

01:33:09.423 --> 01:33:10.632
I do not get it.

01:33:11.425 --> 01:33:13.135
It's just a big rock.

01:33:14.261 --> 01:33:15.387
An asteroid

01:33:15.554 --> 01:33:18.682
fell to earth
65 millions of years.

01:33:20.267 --> 01:33:22.227
The one who killed the dinosaurs?

01:33:22.394 --> 01:33:25.731
No, stop touching everything.
What is this mania?

01:33:26.315 --> 01:33:28.609
It is part of their weapon.

01:33:28.775 --> 01:33:32.070
They sent him here
to mark this planet

01:33:32.237 --> 01:33:35.199
and start over.
This is the Rainfall project.

01:33:37.951 --> 01:33:39.703
I must point it out.

01:33:41.121 --> 01:33:43.498
- Right now.
- And how ?

01:33:43.665 --> 01:33:46.793
Without the codes?
We've been trying for 2 years.

01:33:47.377 --> 01:33:49.505
He has the codes.
I could have found it on my own.

01:33:51.673 --> 01:33:53.675
It's not your fault.

01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:56.136
Yes, it's his fault.

01:33:56.303 --> 01:33:57.888
Me, I have nothing to do.

01:34:00.224 --> 01:34:02.226
Can I check my emails?

01:34:02.893 --> 01:34:04.436
Americans...

01:34:05.103 --> 01:34:07.689
A priority call from Matt Simmons.

01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:10.817
Simmons?

01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:14.613
At least he's loyal.

01:34:16.198 --> 01:34:18.283
Simmons, we're listening to you.

01:34:19.159 --> 01:34:22.329
We discovered Rainfall.
It's a big ...

01:34:22.913 --> 01:34:25.082
Let's say a huge ...

01:34:25.249 --> 01:34:26.208
Explain to him.

01:34:26.375 --> 01:34:28.293
I feel stressed.
He's a destroyer of planets

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:31.213
sent to earth
millions of years ago.

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:34.258
Embedded technology
has shaped our world.

01:34:34.424 --> 01:34:35.968
Launched at sufficient speed,

01:34:36.134 --> 01:34:37.678
it will start again.

01:34:37.845 --> 01:34:39.137
This is what they were looking for.

01:34:39.304 --> 01:34:40.681
If they get it back,

01:34:40.848 --> 01:34:41.890
it is folded.

01:34:45.769 --> 01:34:46.979
We're going to deliver it to them.

01:34:48.272 --> 01:34:52.317
We stuff it with toxin,
they suck it up and we blow it up.

01:34:52.901 --> 01:34:54.862
My colonel ...
What about the other Grays?

01:34:55.737 --> 01:34:57.364
It's the price to pay.

01:34:57.865 --> 01:35:00.075
How is your
make them bite the hook?

01:35:03.829 --> 01:35:05.455
Reestablish the connection.

01:35:06.039 --> 01:35:07.833
Stop it!

01:35:08.292 --> 01:35:10.169
I said not to touch anything!

01:35:10.335 --> 01:35:11.545
Damn it.

01:35:12.045 --> 01:35:13.797
You have to stop him from doing that.

01:35:13.964 --> 01:35:14.882
Vermin!

01:35:15.048 --> 01:35:16.967
How are we going to contact them?

01:35:29.938 --> 01:35:31.607
How it is possible ?

01:35:32.566 --> 01:35:35.360
It has been inert for 50 years.

01:35:35.527 --> 01:35:38.238
It's a Kal'i.
His DNA activated him.

01:35:39.031 --> 01:35:41.491
Don't you know that?
You should know that.

01:35:56.798 --> 01:36:00.552
I understand better ...
The helmet, your presence here,

01:36:01.053 --> 01:36:03.388
your Kal'i friends who were following us.

01:36:03.555 --> 01:36:05.140
I was a Kal'i.

01:36:06.642 --> 01:36:07.893
Not anymore.

01:36:09.061 --> 01:36:10.187
Do not do that.

01:36:10.354 --> 01:36:11.188
Move out of the way.

01:36:11.355 --> 01:36:13.857
He could have killed us 10 times.
I won't move.

01:36:14.024 --> 01:36:15.901
I wanted to find him before them.

01:36:16.735 --> 01:36:18.111
There is only one.

01:36:18.278 --> 01:36:20.489
They are unable to reproduce it.

01:36:21.406 --> 01:36:22.824
I want to end it.

01:36:25.744 --> 01:36:29.039
I risked my life
and that of my family

01:36:29.623 --> 01:36:32.584
to rally me
for the sake of your kind.

01:36:33.418 --> 01:36:35.254
I can't turn around.

01:36:35.796 --> 01:36:37.881
If you don't trust me ...

01:36:42.135 --> 01:36:44.012
you better kill me.

01:36:49.226 --> 01:36:50.769
You guys are hot.

01:36:50.936 --> 01:36:52.062
Wait.

01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:55.190
If they use it,
the planet will be uninhabitable.

01:36:56.066 --> 01:36:58.443
We will remain in hibernation.

01:36:58.944 --> 01:37:01.822
As if we had left
our planet yesterday.

01:37:01.989 --> 01:37:04.741
They destroyed
all American cities

01:37:04.908 --> 01:37:06.577
with that kind of stone.

01:37:07.619 --> 01:37:08.453
And Sydney.

01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:09.997
Sydney was destroyed?

01:37:11.248 --> 01:37:14.918
The survivors are reunited
at the base of Hayes.

01:37:15.085 --> 01:37:17.087
How do you know all this?

01:37:18.088 --> 01:37:21.425
Because I'm the Americans
hell!

01:37:21.884 --> 01:37:25.053
And he has access
to a spy satellite in orbit.

01:37:26.013 --> 01:37:27.264
It's not true.

01:37:27.431 --> 01:37:28.265
It's not true.

01:37:34.062 --> 01:37:35.272
It does not smell good.

01:37:35.439 --> 01:37:36.481
They are there.

01:37:38.775 --> 01:37:39.735
Matt.

01:37:39.902 --> 01:37:41.236
Marcus is right.

01:37:41.904 --> 01:37:44.406
He has guts
and he's on our side.

01:37:44.573 --> 01:37:46.408
Trust people a little.

01:37:47.201 --> 01:37:49.411
They, on the other hand,
I don't really know.

01:37:50.829 --> 01:37:52.164
What do we do ?

01:37:52.331 --> 01:37:55.000
Hayes lashes out at the weak.

01:37:56.293 --> 01:37:58.420
You are not weak.

01:38:03.258 --> 01:38:05.719
Is he really the only one of this type?

01:38:07.304 --> 01:38:08.680
Exact.

01:38:10.807 --> 01:38:12.309
We're gonna make him fart.

01:38:14.144 --> 01:38:16.063
We have gasoline and bleach.

01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:19.274
The mixture of the two will catch fire.

01:38:19.942 --> 01:38:21.527
I'm making the detonator.

01:38:22.069 --> 01:38:24.696
I have a gun
taped to the back.

01:38:24.863 --> 01:38:25.781
Silence.

01:38:25.948 --> 01:38:27.699
Bud, what can you do in 60 minutes?

01:38:27.866 --> 01:38:30.619
I can have access
to the whole site from the PC.

01:38:30.786 --> 01:38:32.412
- Slow them down.
- Go ahead.

01:38:32.579 --> 01:38:34.206
Garry, Bella, Marcus with me.

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:35.874
With joy.

01:38:36.583 --> 01:38:37.668
Be careful.

01:38:39.670 --> 01:38:40.879
I need a battery.

01:38:41.046 --> 01:38:42.965
Follow me over here.

01:38:43.131 --> 01:38:44.591
And a switch.

01:38:44.758 --> 01:38:45.759
I have that.

01:38:48.512 --> 01:38:50.764
Request for reinforcement in the cells.

01:38:50.931 --> 01:38:53.934
Multiple emergencies.
1st and 2nd degree injuries.

01:38:59.773 --> 01:39:01.859
Break-ins in Block Alpha.

01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:22.296
We need reinforcements.

01:39:23.505 --> 01:39:26.008
Zero 1, there are too many of them.

01:39:43.609 --> 01:39:44.651
Standing.

01:39:45.027 --> 01:39:45.944
It's okay ?

01:40:07.257 --> 01:40:09.301
Fall back!

01:40:20.062 --> 01:40:22.272
One of their ships pulls out.

01:40:22.689 --> 01:40:25.067
To all devices,
target the remaining ships.

01:40:25.234 --> 01:40:26.818
They have priority.

01:40:29.029 --> 01:40:31.156
Here we are, guys.

01:40:35.494 --> 01:40:37.412
Amelia, what's going on?

01:40:37.579 --> 01:40:38.997
Aren't you angry with your girl?

01:40:39.164 --> 01:40:41.291
- I hope.
- So much the better, come on.

01:41:05.482 --> 01:41:06.775
Fire!

01:41:22.958 --> 01:41:23.876
Stay here !

01:41:46.190 --> 01:41:47.232
To the left !

01:42:12.716 --> 01:42:15.552
Zorro to PC.
Target within range in 2 minutes.

01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:19.348
Local radio.

01:42:19.515 --> 01:42:20.349
Hi.

01:42:21.058 --> 01:42:21.892
You allow ?

01:42:23.143 --> 01:42:24.269
You're welcome.

01:42:29.691 --> 01:42:31.151
Do you know about it?

01:42:31.318 --> 01:42:32.986
I have to find the frequency.

01:42:35.322 --> 01:42:36.240
Swarms.

01:42:36.406 --> 01:42:37.658
That's it ?

01:42:38.575 --> 01:42:40.536
- Come on, Dennis.
- I'm there.

01:42:41.703 --> 01:42:43.205
I'm calling Zorro. To you.

01:42:43.372 --> 01:42:45.040
Hunters approaching.

01:42:45.207 --> 01:42:47.543
At 3 o'clock, he's on you.

01:42:49.086 --> 01:42:50.212
Zorro, answer.

01:42:50.379 --> 01:42:51.505
Who is it ?

01:42:52.130 --> 01:42:52.881
Identify yourself.

01:42:53.799 --> 01:42:55.092
Robin, it's me.

01:42:55.259 --> 01:42:58.637
Don't drop your missiles.
Cancel your mission.

01:43:10.148 --> 01:43:11.483
Zorro, answer.

01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:12.568
Disconnect.

01:43:12.734 --> 01:43:15.362
This frequency
is used by the military.

01:43:15.529 --> 01:43:16.488
You are interfering.

01:43:16.655 --> 01:43:17.489
Zorro.

01:43:17.656 --> 01:43:20.450
- Target within range?
- In 45 seconds.

01:43:20.617 --> 01:43:21.994
Watch out for crossfire.

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:23.912
Robin, it's Amelia.
You hear me ?

01:43:25.414 --> 01:43:26.206
Robin!

01:43:28.375 --> 01:43:31.336
This bitch must not be far.
Find her.

01:43:31.879 --> 01:43:32.713
Execution!

01:43:34.173 --> 01:43:36.300
Robin, you need to know ...

01:43:36.466 --> 01:43:39.803
Hayes massacres our alien allies.

01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:41.513
The weapon you carry

01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:43.432
will wipe out all the Grays.

01:43:43.599 --> 01:43:45.267
It doesn't matter which side they are on.

01:43:46.143 --> 01:43:48.854
Zorro, don't mind it.
Follow my orders.

01:43:49.605 --> 01:43:51.190
Open fire as soon as possible.

01:43:51.356 --> 01:43:53.525
I take heavy fire.

01:43:56.486 --> 01:43:58.614
Robin, I know you can hear us.

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:00.574
Trust Amelia.

01:44:01.158 --> 01:44:03.827
The only way to eliminate the enemy,
it is to fire.

01:44:03.994 --> 01:44:05.412
Received. Another 30 seconds.

01:44:06.163 --> 01:44:06.955
Abraham

01:44:07.122 --> 01:44:08.624
died for our cause.

01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:10.167
He gave his life

01:44:10.334 --> 01:44:11.835
and I swear that our allies

01:44:12.002 --> 01:44:13.504
want to save this world.

01:44:14.087 --> 01:44:15.964
Think carefully, Robin!

01:44:16.131 --> 01:44:18.717
Remember
of your decimated family.

01:44:18.884 --> 01:44:21.428
These are women and children.

01:44:23.013 --> 01:44:24.973
It won't bring us peace.

01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:26.808
We will find another way.

01:44:26.975 --> 01:44:28.644
This is not the solution.

01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:31.813
Zorro to PC.

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:33.774
I disengage.

01:44:34.399 --> 01:44:35.275
They are there,

01:44:35.442 --> 01:44:36.443
fire!

01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:41.114
Mission canceled.

01:44:41.281 --> 01:44:43.659
To all devices.
Mission canceled.

01:44:43.909 --> 01:44:45.494
Well received.

01:44:46.703 --> 01:44:47.913
Zorro leader?

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.122
My colonel.

01:44:49.289 --> 01:44:50.707
Carry on.

01:44:59.883 --> 01:45:02.344
Blackbird, I said cancel!

01:45:18.652 --> 01:45:20.237
Well done !

01:45:27.536 --> 01:45:28.495
Let's go.

01:45:29.121 --> 01:45:29.913
It's now.

01:45:38.005 --> 01:45:39.214
Protect the colonel.

01:45:49.183 --> 01:45:50.726
Amelia, the PC is ours.

01:45:51.768 --> 01:45:54.188
- Suarez is in bad shape.
- Press there.

01:45:54.354 --> 01:45:56.231
Hayes got the hell out of it.

01:46:00.319 --> 01:46:01.820
Find Hayes, I'll remember them.

01:46:01.987 --> 01:46:03.155
Cover me.

01:46:27.721 --> 01:46:28.680
To the right !

01:46:30.307 --> 01:46:31.225
Does that remind you of anything?

01:46:31.683 --> 01:46:32.976
Who would have believed it ?

01:47:24.319 --> 01:47:26.780
Matt, two aliens
in the west corridor.

01:47:26.947 --> 01:47:30.409
It sucks, they will find me
and then they ...

01:47:30.576 --> 01:47:31.618
Steve!

01:47:31.785 --> 01:47:32.995
Stay cool.

01:47:34.162 --> 01:47:36.415
You see these Kal'i
in the service tunnel?

01:47:37.082 --> 01:47:40.169
We can empty
the air conditioning system.

01:47:40.335 --> 01:47:41.170
Barbecue.

01:47:45.299 --> 01:47:46.258
And boom !

01:47:47.176 --> 01:47:49.428
- That's all ?
- We're going to smoke you!

01:47:50.721 --> 01:47:53.223
- We are going.
- It was nice.

01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:55.559
Open up, let me in.

01:47:56.768 --> 01:47:57.561
Between.

01:48:18.749 --> 01:48:19.791
Swarms.

01:48:51.365 --> 01:48:52.574
You're welcome.

01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:02.751
In your face.

01:49:10.467 --> 01:49:12.636
Go help Pete
to blow up the asteroid.

01:49:15.597 --> 01:49:16.598
Go!

01:49:37.369 --> 01:49:39.162
Run for your life !

01:49:45.377 --> 01:49:46.920
Brave beasts.

01:49:47.087 --> 01:49:48.255
You're welcome.

01:49:53.343 --> 01:49:54.970
On the way to Pine Gap.

01:49:55.137 --> 01:49:58.265
My colonel,
the spread has reached its limit.

01:49:58.432 --> 01:49:59.975
One kilometer in diameter.

01:50:00.142 --> 01:50:01.894
Favored by the prevailing winds.

01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:03.937
- The enemy outside is down.
- And downstairs ?

01:50:04.104 --> 01:50:05.105
No sign.

01:50:05.272 --> 01:50:08.150
We're underground.
It may take a long time.

01:50:08.317 --> 01:50:09.443
We don't have any.

01:50:19.536 --> 01:50:20.495
Your attention.

01:50:21.538 --> 01:50:23.707
Promulgation of Order 1811.

01:50:23.874 --> 01:50:26.460
Kill all non-humans.
I repeat,

01:50:26.627 --> 01:50:30.631
all non-humans
must be killed on sight.

01:50:32.007 --> 01:50:34.009
Not a gesture anymore. Do not move.

01:50:35.344 --> 01:50:37.346
Stay where you are.
It's finish.

01:50:38.096 --> 01:50:39.223
You think ?

01:50:56.114 --> 01:50:57.866
Is that what you wanted?

01:50:59.159 --> 01:51:02.079
Die for your stupid cause.

01:51:28.856 --> 01:51:31.525
And you, for what reason
are you going to die?

01:52:19.489 --> 01:52:21.909
Here Wessex.
I take command.

01:52:22.618 --> 01:52:24.703
Colonel Hayes is dead ...

01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:25.913
Return to the PC.

01:52:26.705 --> 01:52:28.832
Prepare for evacuation.

01:52:29.791 --> 01:52:30.876
Fall back.

01:52:56.985 --> 01:52:58.111
Where is dad ?

01:52:58.529 --> 01:53:00.739
Where are the detonators?
The bomb ?

01:53:08.288 --> 01:53:10.207
You have a bad face, Matthew.

01:53:10.582 --> 01:53:12.084
This is humor.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:37.526
How many are they ?

01:53:58.213 --> 01:53:59.256
What...

01:53:59.631 --> 01:54:02.301
It sucks, I've seen this movie before.

01:54:02.885 --> 01:54:03.760
Impossible.

01:54:05.721 --> 01:54:06.680
And shit.

01:54:14.897 --> 01:54:15.898
Bella ...

01:54:48.889 --> 01:54:49.681
Grab it.

01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:03.445
Catch Garry!

01:55:09.076 --> 01:55:10.827
Help me, Matthew.

01:55:11.245 --> 01:55:12.287
Garry ...

01:55:25.759 --> 01:55:27.386
I won't let you die.

01:56:21.773 --> 01:56:23.108
Bella!

01:56:30.282 --> 01:56:32.034
Let's get the hell out of here!

01:56:33.410 --> 01:56:35.704
Evacuate all refugees.

01:56:40.542 --> 01:56:41.668
Amelia.

01:57:28.757 --> 01:57:32.344
The humans used their weapon.

01:57:37.307 --> 01:57:39.810
To all devices,
new mission.

01:57:39.977 --> 01:57:41.895
Cover the drain.

01:57:48.402 --> 01:57:51.071
Repel these invaders!

01:57:52.030 --> 01:57:55.158
Fight to the last.
For the colonel!

01:57:56.743 --> 01:58:00.080
You will be the heroes of humanity.

01:58:00.747 --> 01:58:02.499
Repel the invaders.

01:58:15.929 --> 01:58:17.306
Thanks, Robin.

01:58:17.848 --> 01:58:19.641
- You made the right choice.
- I hope so.

01:58:20.601 --> 01:58:22.436
I hope Amelia got it right.

02:00:10.711 --> 02:00:12.921
Matt and Marcus, they were there.

02:00:16.258 --> 02:00:17.593
They took them.

02:00:19.094 --> 02:00:20.220
They took them.
