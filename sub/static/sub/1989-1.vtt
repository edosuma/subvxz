00:08.058 --> 00:10.642
(upbeat music)

00:15.100 --> 00:17.070
- [Narrator] Our story begins,

00:17.070 --> 00:20.313
as so many do, in a doctor's office.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.930
- You're 100% sure, Doc?

00:23.930 --> 00:24.770
- Well, in my line of work,

00:24.770 --> 00:26.793
nothing's 100%, but I'm sure.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.063
Oh, we're having a boy.

00:31.970 --> 00:34.570
- [Narrator] Which led to
one name being settled on,

00:35.470 --> 00:37.797
a very popular name, as it turned out.

00:39.338 --> 00:40.778
Max!

00:40.778 --> 00:41.730
I didn't do it!

00:41.730 --> 00:42.680
Not you.

00:42.680 --> 00:43.593
Max!

00:44.670 --> 00:46.130
He bit me first!

00:46.130 --> 00:48.380
No. Max Kuftinec!

00:48.380 --> 00:50.010
Coming, Ms. Winter!

00:50.010 --> 00:53.590
And in China, it's considered
polite to burp when you eat.

00:53.590 --> 00:55.060
It shows you like the food.

00:55.060 --> 00:56.479
Cool!

00:56.479 --> 00:57.510
Gross.

00:57.510 --> 00:59.150
Max, your father is
picking you up early today.

00:59.150 --> 00:59.983
Get your things ready.

00:59.983 --> 01:00.816
Yes, Ms. Winter.

01:02.350 --> 01:06.170
Max, it's been nice
having you in my class.

01:06.170 --> 01:07.870
I'll be back tomorrow, Ms. Winter.

01:14.719 --> 01:16.770
Hey, we're just checking it out, okay?

01:16.770 --> 01:17.763
No decisions yet.

01:32.534 --> 01:34.950
Obviously Max is very bright.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.160
What can you tell me about her

01:36.160 --> 01:38.760
that her test scores can't? Hmm?

01:38.760 --> 01:42.430
Well, uh, Max has always been...

01:42.430 --> 01:44.640
She's been a self-starter ever since...

01:44.640 --> 01:46.800
- [Narrator] Sarah felt
foolish reducing their daughter

01:46.800 --> 01:49.110
to a bunch of words that
a thousand other parents

01:49.110 --> 01:50.803
must have said about their kids.

01:52.180 --> 01:56.933
We can't describe what's
so great about Max,

01:58.060 --> 01:59.690
you know, any more than I can tell you

01:59.690 --> 02:01.540
what's great about the color blue,

02:01.540 --> 02:04.797
but you would be lucky to have her.

02:10.602 --> 02:11.769
What do we do?

02:13.178 --> 02:14.261
I don't know.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.433
She's happy now.

02:17.830 --> 02:18.663
I know.

02:24.773 --> 02:26.340
And even with the scholarship,

02:26.340 --> 02:27.600
we would still have to come up

02:27.600 --> 02:30.130
with at least another couple thousand.

02:30.130 --> 02:31.230
That's just this year.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.220
Well, I could ask for a raise.

02:35.220 --> 02:36.370
They just gave you one.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.150
I could ask for a raise.

02:41.540 --> 02:42.467
They owe me one.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.783
I guess my first question is why?

02:56.965 --> 02:58.103
I mean, I like PS 41.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.180
And you always tell me how lucky we are

03:00.180 --> 03:02.090
to have a great local public school.

03:02.090 --> 03:03.660
Yes, and that's true,

03:03.660 --> 03:05.420
but you're the smartest kid

03:05.420 --> 03:07.550
in your class right now, right?

03:07.550 --> 03:08.510
Maybe.

03:08.510 --> 03:11.410
Well, maybe it would
be good to be somewhere

03:11.410 --> 03:13.343
where you weren't the smartest kid.

03:14.180 --> 03:15.433
Someone's gotta be.

03:16.602 --> 03:17.462
I know, Max.

03:17.462 --> 03:18.295
I know.

03:18.295 --> 03:19.400
Who knows how far you could go in life?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.630
We just want to give you
every opportunity to do that.

03:21.630 --> 03:24.130
Right, and ultimately,
this is your decision.

03:24.130 --> 03:25.210
Mm-hmm.

03:25.210 --> 03:28.140
But Papa and I think this
would be very good for you,

03:28.140 --> 03:31.800
and if you don't like it, you
can always go back to PS 41.

03:31.800 --> 03:32.633
That's right.

03:34.856 --> 03:36.610
Okay.

03:36.610 --> 03:38.520
So how would I get there?

03:38.520 --> 03:40.580
Okay. Well, you would take the subway,

03:40.580 --> 03:42.003
and Papa would go with you.

03:42.003 --> 03:43.083
When I can.

03:44.330 --> 03:45.163
Hang on a sec.

03:45.163 --> 03:46.710
What do you mean, "When I can"?

03:46.710 --> 03:48.240
I can't be late to the
restaurant every day.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.640
No, I'm not talking every day.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.213
I'm talking a couple times a week.

03:51.213 --> 03:52.118
Well, how... this is not
what we talked about.

03:52.118 --> 03:53.076
It is what...

03:53.076 --> 03:53.910
I told you...

03:53.910 --> 03:55.253
Look. Look. Look.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.450
I'll just go alone when
Papa can't take me.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.990
It's fine.

04:00.990 --> 04:01.823
It's fine.

04:02.990 --> 04:04.703
I walk to PS 41 by myself.

04:05.540 --> 04:07.183
I take care of Jez by myself.

04:10.410 --> 04:11.843
I'm not a baby anymore.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.300
- [Narrator] Tom lay in bed that night

04:18.300 --> 04:20.500
wondering if they'd
made the right decision.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.203
Sarah wondered if she
was a good parent or not.

04:27.650 --> 04:29.680
Max wondered what the
library would be like

04:29.680 --> 04:31.103
at the Blackstone Academy.

04:33.420 --> 04:34.793
Jez slept.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.374
I'm going to a new school today.

04:39.374 --> 04:40.494
Really?

04:40.494 --> 04:41.835
Yes.

04:41.835 --> 04:43.752
I'm not a baby anymore.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.720
If I don't see my daughter,

04:50.720 --> 04:53.290
at least I get to see
my granddaughter, huh?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.010
It's your fault, Yaya.

04:56.010 --> 04:58.220
Fault? How?

04:58.220 --> 05:01.550
You were such a good cook that
you made Mama into a chef.

05:01.550 --> 05:03.337
You're a tricky one, matia mou.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.953
Your brains you get from your
mother, not from that one.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.444
Go round and round.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.723
Yaya's got no energy today.

05:14.790 --> 05:16.010
Come on. Tea.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.223
Let's get some tea.

05:23.690 --> 05:27.483
So, this new school, it's better, right?

05:28.478 --> 05:29.870
You know...

05:29.870 --> 05:31.823
they're smart, they take you.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.125
I don't know.

05:35.993 --> 05:36.826
I think it'll be good, but...

05:37.810 --> 05:41.252
(speaking in foreign language)

05:41.252 --> 05:42.330
Uh, I'm sorry.

05:42.330 --> 05:43.750
I don't speak Greek.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.713
You work in Greek cafe. Why?

05:47.204 --> 05:48.260
I don't know.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.213
Cold. Tea ice-cold!

05:52.520 --> 05:53.828
I'm sorry.

05:53.828 --> 05:55.028
I'll heat it up for you.

05:56.550 --> 05:59.237
In Greece, never serve
tea like that, never.

06:00.466 --> 06:02.330
But it was steaming in your...

06:02.330 --> 06:04.683
Maxine, you don't contradict Yayas.

06:05.790 --> 06:08.751
Maybe they teach you
that in your new school.

06:08.751 --> 06:09.748
But I didn't...

06:09.748 --> 06:10.581
Eh!

06:10.581 --> 06:12.303
What I tell you all your life?

06:13.830 --> 06:15.870
If you make a mistake, admit it.

06:15.870 --> 06:18.030
Right. So?

06:18.030 --> 06:19.233
I apologize, Yaya.

06:20.080 --> 06:20.913
Good.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.940
You're not a baby anymore, matia mou.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.826
You must make your own decisions.

06:27.826 --> 06:29.520
Like my Yaya said,

06:31.311 --> 06:34.470
"You don't let life happen to you.

06:34.470 --> 06:36.107
You happen to life."

06:40.250 --> 06:42.177
Sounds better in Greek.

06:52.013 --> 06:53.012
Hi.

06:53.012 --> 06:53.845
Hey.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.010
They're all freaked out about something.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.753
They said the last thing they
could do is give me a raise.

07:05.090 --> 07:05.990
So what do we do?

07:05.990 --> 07:06.823
I don't know.

07:08.330 --> 07:09.775
We could take out a loan.

07:09.775 --> 07:10.775
Not with our credit.

07:11.690 --> 07:14.590
Well, we could borrow money from somebody.

07:14.590 --> 07:15.423
From who?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.670
You want to go door-to-door
in the building,

07:19.510 --> 07:21.410
ask people to loan money to the super?

07:22.360 --> 07:23.843
You gotta get real here, Tom.

07:27.090 --> 07:28.490
I'm gonna take extra shifts.

07:29.568 --> 07:30.401
No.

07:32.532 --> 07:34.532
There's no other option.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.503
I love you so much.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.250
There's nobody who's loved more than you

08:11.250 --> 08:12.360
in this whole world.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.280
You hear me?

08:13.280 --> 08:15.337
I mean, there might be some
people loved as much as you,

08:15.337 --> 08:16.620
but nobody is loved...

08:16.620 --> 08:18.410
I know, Dad.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.913
Now go away.

08:28.468 --> 08:29.933
I hate it when you need them
more than they need you.

08:32.409 --> 08:33.679
Laura Langer.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.513
You're new here.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.320
Tom Kuftinec.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.193
You'll be happy here.

08:38.193 --> 08:39.643
It's a great place.

08:40.991 --> 08:43.291
And 40% of graduates go
to Ivy League schools.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.648
Not that we're thinking
about that kind of thing yet.

08:47.648 --> 08:48.481
Heh.

09:05.843 --> 09:08.033
- [Narrator] A new routine was soon set.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.240
Tom would drop Max off in the morning,

09:11.240 --> 09:13.723
and she would come home
by herself after school.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.730
Can't let things get you down.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.588
Listen, things will get better.

09:33.588 --> 09:35.638
No, but I'm telling you it's... Watch it!

09:36.760 --> 09:38.280
No. It's a totally great show.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.330
You have to watch it.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.083
What are you wearing? (laughs)

10:06.794 --> 10:08.154
Hey, Maxie.

10:08.154 --> 10:08.987
Hi.

10:10.060 --> 10:10.893
Hey, you want to come along?

10:10.893 --> 10:12.940
I gotta fix the lock on 16D.

10:12.940 --> 10:14.850
Um, no, thanks, Papa.

10:14.850 --> 10:16.472
Hey, how was school today?

10:16.472 --> 10:17.363
Fine.

10:18.820 --> 10:20.760
Well, what'd you do today?

10:20.760 --> 10:21.593
Nothing.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.080
Okay, I'll be back as soon as I can.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.430
You call me if you need me.

10:40.420 --> 10:41.253
Excellent.

10:47.290 --> 10:50.140
There's a choice period
after lunch today, Max.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.350
You might consider visiting
the chess club then.

10:52.350 --> 10:55.055
There are other girls
there with your skills.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.430
But I don't know how to play chess.

10:56.430 --> 10:57.263
That's okay.

10:57.263 --> 10:58.110
They can teach you.

10:59.396 --> 11:00.852
Do you have a book that could teach me?

11:00.852 --> 11:03.290
Heh. It's much better
to learn from a person.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.180
The advisor is Mr. Eckhard.

11:05.180 --> 11:07.523
He's an excellent teacher. Okay?

11:22.790 --> 11:23.630
Before you came,

11:23.630 --> 11:25.993
I was the third-best math
student in the class.

11:27.230 --> 11:29.283
Now I'm the fourth.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.807
And who might you be?

11:45.807 --> 11:47.290
I'm Max Kuftinec.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.600
I'm here for the chess club?

11:48.600 --> 11:49.919
Excellent.

11:49.919 --> 11:50.924
What's your level?

11:50.924 --> 11:51.924
I've actually never really...

11:51.924 --> 11:53.210
Mr. Eckhard, Max is a friend of mine.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.160
I'll play with her.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.063
Well, thank you, Isabella.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.563
That's very hospitable of you.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.060
Let's see how smart you are now.

12:04.060 --> 12:05.283
Go ahead. You're white.

12:08.730 --> 12:09.643
Oh, my God.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.933
You don't know how to play.

12:12.830 --> 12:15.293
You don't even know how
to make the first move.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.513
That's pathetic.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.087
One day, I'm going to come back here,

12:21.087 --> 12:23.233
and I'm going to teach you some manners.

12:25.180 --> 12:27.013
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

12:29.727 --> 12:30.600
What happened?

12:30.600 --> 12:32.170
Why did she leave?

12:32.170 --> 12:33.946
To be honest, Mr. Eckhard,

12:33.946 --> 12:36.610
I don't think she liked you very much.

12:36.610 --> 12:37.443
I'm sorry.

13:38.968 --> 13:39.801
Hey, kids!

13:39.801 --> 13:40.634
Hi.

13:40.634 --> 13:42.680
Papa, do you think you could
teach me how to play...

13:42.680 --> 13:43.513
Maxie, I gotta run.

13:43.513 --> 13:45.890
Mrs. Rosenhirsch has mice.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.290
One of them's in the bathtub

13:48.430 --> 13:49.530
with Mrs. Rosenhirsch.

13:54.540 --> 13:56.080
Okay, listen, if I'm not back by 7:00,

13:56.080 --> 13:57.170
get dinner out of the fridge, okay?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.670
I love you two! Call me
if you need me, all right?

14:03.870 --> 14:04.863
Becky Langer.

14:07.610 --> 14:09.083
Sophie Glass.

14:11.420 --> 14:12.403
Isabella Diaz.

14:15.100 --> 14:15.933
Max Kuftinec.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.690
She's has a boy's first
name and a stupid last name.

14:37.532 --> 14:38.534
I know it's hard to do,

14:38.534 --> 14:40.130
but sometimes you gotta
take a chance, man.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.940
Yeah, I know.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.320
No, you should go for it.

14:43.320 --> 14:46.316
It can't take too long to learn, can it?

14:46.316 --> 14:49.116
I've always wanted to
learn another language.

14:49.116 --> 14:50.330
Just find the right guy.

14:50.330 --> 14:52.033
Pick the one you want to learn from.

14:52.033 --> 14:55.283
All the little league coaches are good.

15:19.130 --> 15:19.963
Go away.

15:25.010 --> 15:26.003
You're still here.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.800
Fine. Let's play.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.460
I'll let you win,

15:30.460 --> 15:32.140
for a while.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.916
Costs five bucks.

15:33.916 --> 15:35.540
I don't know how to play chess,

15:35.540 --> 15:37.650
and I don't usually talk to strangers.

15:37.650 --> 15:40.390
Not talking to strangers is smart,

15:40.390 --> 15:43.120
but not playing chess, that's just stupid.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.660
What's 25 times 14?

15:44.660 --> 15:46.660
Something tells me I'm about to find out.

15:46.660 --> 15:49.400
350, I'm not stupid.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.750
Fine.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.988
But you're, like, what, six years old,

15:52.988 --> 15:54.810
and you don't know how to play chess yet?

15:54.810 --> 15:56.929
What kind of crappy school you go to?

15:56.929 --> 15:58.490
I want to learn how to play,

15:58.490 --> 16:00.120
and I'm not 6, I'm 10.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.470
When I was 10, I was
carrying blocks of ice

16:03.470 --> 16:06.028
up 5 flights of stairs.

16:06.028 --> 16:09.120
I don't think that's possible

16:09.120 --> 16:10.940
unless you're, like, 90.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.628
Fine. My father did that, not me.

16:13.628 --> 16:16.300
But I certainly knew how to
play chess when I was 10.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.187
Hell, I won the city
tournament when I was 10.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.409
Why don't you use that Google?

16:21.409 --> 16:23.690
I hear it can teach you anything.

16:23.690 --> 16:24.523
I don't know.

16:24.523 --> 16:28.689
I just had a feeling you
might be able to teach me.

16:28.689 --> 16:31.190
Plus you're two blocks from my house,

16:31.190 --> 16:34.033
and you seem to have some free time.

16:35.128 --> 16:38.490
Well, kid, you gotta play for something.

16:38.490 --> 16:40.770
Any city kid knows that.

16:40.770 --> 16:42.983
And these days, I play for money.

16:44.412 --> 16:45.245
Hmph.

16:57.628 --> 16:59.463
Fashion show.

16:59.463 --> 17:00.546
Fashion show.

17:02.450 --> 17:06.260
Max, how come Mama isn't
home for dinner anymore?

17:06.260 --> 17:07.359
Because she's working.

17:08.410 --> 17:10.200
Why does she work?

17:10.200 --> 17:13.130
So she can make money for our family.

17:13.130 --> 17:15.089
But Papa works, too.

17:15.089 --> 17:16.940
Well, both Mama and Papa have to work

17:16.940 --> 17:18.770
so that we have enough money.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.089
Let's call Mama.

17:20.089 --> 17:21.210
She's busy.

17:21.210 --> 17:22.420
Then let's call Papa.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.880
He's busy, too.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.492
We should only call him
if it's an emergency.

17:26.492 --> 17:28.140
Oh.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.687
Then let's call Yaya.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.466
All right.

17:42.252 --> 17:43.085
Hi, Yaya.

17:44.476 --> 17:45.309
I'm good.

17:46.732 --> 17:47.649
Okay. Here.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.470
Hi, Yaya.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.380
Matia mou, what your
little sister doing awake?

17:54.380 --> 17:56.460
It's after bedtime, right?

17:56.460 --> 17:57.293
Yeah, but...

17:57.293 --> 17:59.440
What, you have an excuse?

17:59.440 --> 18:01.314
Sort of. I mean...

18:01.314 --> 18:04.173
Matia mou, what I'm going to say?

18:04.173 --> 18:06.270
You're going to tell
me not to make excuses.

18:06.270 --> 18:07.940
I'll put her to bed now.

18:07.940 --> 18:09.133
Good girl.

18:09.133 --> 18:11.340
And you don't stay up late.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.340
Nothing good happens late.

18:13.340 --> 18:14.740
Okay.

18:14.740 --> 18:15.573
Matia mou, go.

18:23.660 --> 18:25.718
Hi.

18:25.718 --> 18:27.023
Hi.

18:28.970 --> 18:30.323
How were the girls?

18:31.318 --> 18:32.340
They were fine,

18:32.340 --> 18:33.870
no problems.

18:33.870 --> 18:38.110
Think they even remember my name?

18:38.110 --> 18:39.003
They love you.

18:40.140 --> 18:43.750
Sweetie, could you please
remove my shoes at some point?

19:02.660 --> 19:04.320
It's $5.00.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.380
I get a dollar a week.

19:05.380 --> 19:07.063
I'll pay you the rest in two weeks.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.450
At least you can do a little math.

19:13.180 --> 19:15.030
It's lucky for you I'm such a softie.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.840
But if anybody else
wants to play, you scram.

19:18.840 --> 19:19.673
You got it?

19:19.673 --> 19:21.200
I'm not too worried about that.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.540
You hear me?

19:22.540 --> 19:24.720
Yeah, I scram.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.550
Whatever that means.

19:26.550 --> 19:27.830
Okay.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.206
I'm Norman.

19:29.206 --> 19:30.039
What's your name?

19:30.039 --> 19:31.190
Max.

19:31.190 --> 19:32.640
What's with names these days?

19:33.740 --> 19:35.850
It's like roll call at a tenement in 1920.

19:35.850 --> 19:37.843
Max, Samuel, Zachary, Nathan.

19:39.510 --> 19:40.927
I'm gonna call you Shmuel.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.950
I don't know if you noticed.

19:43.950 --> 19:44.783
I'm a girl.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.110
Come back tomorrow, Shmuel.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.700
What?

19:48.700 --> 19:49.860
You, (speaking in foreign language).

19:52.410 --> 19:53.710
Why are you speaking Spanish?

19:53.710 --> 19:56.480
Because you don't seem
to understand English.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.600
And don't use that
Google to learn anything.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.890
You told me before to use it.

19:59.890 --> 20:02.980
You want to learn my way or their way?

20:02.980 --> 20:04.100
Who's "they"?

20:04.100 --> 20:06.437
Everybody else.

20:06.437 --> 20:07.800
I don't know.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.450
Whose way is better?

20:09.450 --> 20:11.110
You want your money back?

20:11.110 --> 20:11.943
Okay.

20:11.943 --> 20:13.380
I won't use that Google.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.438
Or that Bingo or that Skitter.

20:16.438 --> 20:17.960
I have no idea what you're talking about.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.053
Just don't.

20:20.358 --> 20:21.358
I'll know if you do.

20:22.982 --> 20:23.843
Now get out of here.

20:34.130 --> 20:36.213
Come on. You can help me with this.

20:36.213 --> 20:37.710
Just play along, okay?

20:37.710 --> 20:38.630
Don't say anything.

20:38.630 --> 20:39.463
Just look cute.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.473
Hey!

20:46.420 --> 20:47.800
Hey!

20:47.800 --> 20:50.060
Look little sis, it's Jeremy Lin!

20:50.060 --> 20:50.970
No, I'm not.

20:50.970 --> 20:53.600
It's Jeremy Lin, your favorite
person in the whole world.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.710
You were so sad when he left
the Knicks, but here he is!

20:56.710 --> 20:57.980
Look, I'm not Jeremy...

20:57.980 --> 20:59.120
Jeremy, it's so great that you're here.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.310
My poor sister, she's been so sick.

21:01.310 --> 21:03.860
Look, could you just
give her an autograph?

21:03.860 --> 21:04.790
It'll mean the world to her.

21:04.790 --> 21:06.113
Look, uh, I...

21:06.113 --> 21:08.803
Just one autograph to make
a sick little girl happy.

21:10.699 --> 21:11.532
Okay.

21:17.100 --> 21:17.933
Here you go.

21:17.933 --> 21:19.430
Thank you so much, Jeremy.

21:19.430 --> 21:20.280
Hang on a minute.

21:22.001 --> 21:23.670
That's not how you spell "Jeremy."

21:23.670 --> 21:25.120
You're not really Jeremy Lin!

21:26.982 --> 21:29.520
Now look what you've done, fake Jeremy!

21:29.520 --> 21:30.840
You've broken my little sister's heart.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.440
Are you happy now?

21:32.440 --> 21:34.390
No. I, I was trying to tell you I'm not.

21:34.390 --> 21:37.130
Look, you gotta make this right.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.833
Give me some money so I could
buy my sister some candy.

21:40.730 --> 21:43.180
I don't know who you think you are,

21:43.180 --> 21:45.410
impersonating Jeremy Lin in public

21:45.410 --> 21:47.277
and misleading a little girl.

21:47.277 --> 21:48.110
Here.

21:48.110 --> 21:49.281
Here's a five, okay?

21:49.281 --> 21:50.278
Okay?

21:50.278 --> 21:51.273
I saw a 10 in there.

21:53.340 --> 21:54.173
Fine, 10.

21:58.410 --> 22:00.210
Give me half, or I'll tell your mom.

22:02.350 --> 22:04.170
Here is two.

22:04.170 --> 22:06.070
You didn't have to do anything.

22:06.070 --> 22:08.170
Give me half, or I'll tell both your moms.

22:10.010 --> 22:10.843
Fine.

22:12.510 --> 22:15.277
Hey, how's that new
fancy-pants school of yours?

22:15.277 --> 22:17.302
No way it's better than PS 41.

22:17.302 --> 22:18.900
I don't think it's better,

22:18.900 --> 22:20.210
but it's different.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.480
Are the kids smarter?

22:21.480 --> 22:25.300
No, but they're more the same.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.133
Of course they are.

22:26.133 --> 22:27.520
They're all girls.

22:27.520 --> 22:28.970
Yeah, but...

22:28.970 --> 22:30.720
they're all the same kind of girls.

23:09.270 --> 23:11.530
Hey, look. It's little orphan Annie.

23:11.530 --> 23:13.630
Annie, I'd like you to meet my friend Mel.

23:14.820 --> 23:16.820
Except he's not really a friend of mine.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.700
And his name's not really Mel.

23:21.680 --> 23:22.930
I got my allowance early.

23:27.010 --> 23:28.662
Scram.

23:28.662 --> 23:29.495
I was winning.

23:29.495 --> 23:32.000
Bull oney, you were winning.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.310
I was six moves from checkmating you.

23:34.310 --> 23:36.413
I was four moves from checkmating you.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.070
Oh, you couldn't beat me

23:39.070 --> 23:41.583
if I gave you a bullwhip and Jake LaMotta.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.930
I've been beating that guy
since before you were born.

23:47.930 --> 23:48.983
That's not very long.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.550
Okay, since before your father was born.

23:52.550 --> 23:54.550
You got an answer for everything?

23:54.550 --> 23:55.724
Most things.

23:55.724 --> 23:57.360
Great.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.453
Lucky for you I love kids so much.

24:00.450 --> 24:01.283
Okay.

24:01.283 --> 24:02.116
Let's get started.

24:03.046 --> 24:04.760
What do you know about chess?

24:04.760 --> 24:06.501
Not much.

24:06.501 --> 24:08.601
Do you know how the different pieces move?

24:09.920 --> 24:10.793
Not really.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.617
Do you know what each piece is called?

24:15.200 --> 24:16.290
Not precisely.

24:16.290 --> 24:17.463
Not precisely.

24:18.490 --> 24:19.630
Do you know anything about chess?

24:19.630 --> 24:22.200
I know it's a good game for smart people.

24:22.200 --> 24:25.233
Now that is the first sensible
thing I've heard you say.

24:26.438 --> 24:27.423
Okay.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.773
This is called a pawn.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.190
It's barely worth the space it occupies,

24:35.190 --> 24:36.303
a lot like a kid.

24:38.100 --> 24:40.490
Like a kid, a pawn can't move very fast,

24:40.490 --> 24:42.700
only one space at a time,

24:42.700 --> 24:44.650
except for its first move,

24:44.650 --> 24:45.600
when it can go two.

24:46.817 --> 24:51.250
Like a kid, excited at first, then lazy.

24:51.250 --> 24:53.053
Lucky for me you love kids so much.

24:55.036 --> 24:55.986
You're a cocky kid.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.670
Where'd you say you're from?

24:59.670 --> 25:01.453
Over there, in the Village.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.500
I grew up in Brooklyn.

25:04.410 --> 25:07.063
Now Brooklyn's a place yuppies move to.

25:08.232 --> 25:11.160
I didn't think there
were any city kids left.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.876
What are you talking about?

25:12.876 --> 25:14.094
There are lots of city.

25:14.094 --> 25:16.694
Just living in the city
doesn't make you a city kid.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.070
These kids might as
well be in Westchester.

25:20.070 --> 25:21.883
Their nannies take 'em everywhere.

25:23.460 --> 25:25.900
A city kid, he's cocky,

25:25.900 --> 25:27.197
but not too cocky,

25:28.076 --> 25:29.580
knows how to play things.

25:29.580 --> 25:32.723
And a city kid sees the
way it all goes together.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.410
You know what I'm talking about?

25:36.410 --> 25:38.071
I think so.

25:38.071 --> 25:39.890
Well, we'll find out.

25:39.890 --> 25:40.930
You know why all the best players

25:40.930 --> 25:42.214
are city kids?

25:42.214 --> 25:43.400
No.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.100
Because they're used to
different kinds of people

25:45.100 --> 25:47.500
bumping into each other every day

25:47.500 --> 25:50.763
in different ways, always changing,

25:51.960 --> 25:53.110
just like a chessboard.

25:54.210 --> 25:55.830
What do you mean?

25:55.830 --> 25:59.940
For instance, I already told
you pawns are like kids.

25:59.940 --> 26:04.523
So this pawn is you.

26:06.927 --> 26:08.110
You just started a new school,

26:08.110 --> 26:09.600
so you move forward.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.660
How'd you know I started a new school?

26:11.660 --> 26:12.670
Your fancy new duds,

26:12.670 --> 26:14.430
and you don't look very
comfortable in 'em.

26:14.430 --> 26:16.773
Only, you're not sure
about this new school,

26:17.690 --> 26:21.033
so you only go one square
forward instead of two.

26:22.060 --> 26:25.120
Once you take your hand off
the piece, your move is done.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.480
It's my turn.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.191
I'm playing against you?

26:28.191 --> 26:29.412
You're not playing yet.

26:29.412 --> 26:31.280
You're just moving the pieces.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.760
Come back tomorrow.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.840
One move a day is plenty.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.440
One move a day?

26:36.440 --> 26:37.273
Come on!

26:38.692 --> 26:39.525
Go.

26:48.351 --> 26:51.684
Okay, class, open to page 41, geography.

26:53.820 --> 26:57.370
Today we're talking about
the United States of America,

26:57.370 --> 26:59.130
but we're talking about
all of the Americas,

26:59.130 --> 26:59.963
which includes.

27:00.810 --> 27:02.023
Hold on just one second.

27:06.052 --> 27:07.290
Hi.

27:07.290 --> 27:08.123
Hi. Yes.

27:09.850 --> 27:10.852
Go away. Go away.

27:10.852 --> 27:11.850
Go away. Go away.

27:11.850 --> 27:12.852
Go away. Go away.

27:12.852 --> 27:13.685
Go away.

27:17.754 --> 27:18.587
Thank God.

27:20.710 --> 27:24.293
Max, your father wants you to
wait for him here after class.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.230
Class!

27:27.230 --> 27:29.110
Girls, enough!

27:29.110 --> 27:31.243
Let's get back to the lesson, okay?

27:38.074 --> 27:39.760
You know, my bedroom window's stuck.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.060
Maybe your dad can come
over later and fix it.

27:52.873 --> 27:53.706
Maxie.

27:57.135 --> 27:57.968
It's Yaya.

28:50.018 --> 28:50.938
Hi.

28:50.938 --> 28:53.060
Listen, honey, I know
you're having a tough time,

28:53.060 --> 28:53.950
but it'll get better.

28:53.950 --> 28:55.003
I promise.

28:57.270 --> 28:58.710
I was just thinking about

28:58.710 --> 29:01.333
how things always change, you know?

29:03.760 --> 29:06.443
I was thinking about how we're all born,

29:07.360 --> 29:10.373
and then we get older and older, until...

29:14.474 --> 29:17.057
I can't stop thinking about it.

29:18.060 --> 29:18.903
I see.

29:20.970 --> 29:23.640
Well, you know I'm always
gonna be here for you,

29:23.640 --> 29:25.703
and Mama's always gonna be here for you.

29:27.930 --> 29:29.463
Not always.

29:34.350 --> 29:38.323
As long as you need us, we'll be here.

29:44.100 --> 29:45.400
I'm gonna sit over there for a bit

29:45.400 --> 29:46.600
if that's okay with you.

29:48.911 --> 29:49.744
All right?

30:17.190 --> 30:18.246
That's right.

30:18.246 --> 30:20.180
Another kid's coming at you.

30:20.180 --> 30:21.030
What do you mean?

30:23.110 --> 30:24.483
This is you, right?

30:25.770 --> 30:27.640
You've stepped out on your own,

30:27.640 --> 30:29.880
out onto an island a little bit,

30:29.880 --> 30:32.350
and you could move further on your own,

30:32.350 --> 30:33.860
but that'd be stupid, right?

30:33.860 --> 30:35.420
Even you can see that.

30:35.420 --> 30:38.243
So you take your best friend,

30:39.200 --> 30:40.467
bring her up next to you.

30:41.366 --> 30:42.700
I don't have a best friend.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.900
Then any friend you
have at that new school.

30:45.807 --> 30:47.809
I don't have any.

30:47.809 --> 30:50.507
You don't have any?

30:50.507 --> 30:52.037
Then you better get some.

30:52.037 --> 30:54.593
You can't win a chess
game with just one piece.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.073
Well, there's my little sister.

30:58.350 --> 30:59.653
That's pathetic.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.170
But you gotta move something.

31:05.320 --> 31:08.020
Not that your little sis can
help you much over there.

31:09.480 --> 31:13.113
Look, your board is your city,

31:14.486 --> 31:15.560
and your city is your board.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.146
You understand?

31:17.146 --> 31:20.188
No.

31:20.188 --> 31:21.202
Never mind.

31:21.202 --> 31:22.207
That's enough for today.

31:22.207 --> 31:23.040
Get out of here.

31:49.350 --> 31:51.330
You can't just keep
moving your little sister.

31:51.330 --> 31:54.110
Well, I'm thinking about
going back to my old school.

31:54.110 --> 31:55.810
I have friends there.

31:55.810 --> 31:58.250
They kicking you out of
that fancy new place?

31:58.250 --> 32:01.463
No, I just don't know if
it's the right school for me.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.100
So you're just gonna quit

32:04.100 --> 32:06.390
before you give it a fair chance.

32:06.390 --> 32:07.223
Right.

32:07.223 --> 32:08.280
That's a great idea.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.590
You're behind, so you should quit now.

32:11.590 --> 32:13.040
I didn't say I was quitting.

32:13.040 --> 32:16.513
Thinking about quitting
is the same as quitting.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.823
Maybe you should just go
play checkers instead.

32:23.169 --> 32:25.263
They play a lot of
checkers in Westchester.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.730
Did you ever notice that Miss
Bailes looks like a walrus?

32:41.990 --> 32:44.120
Heh. Not before,

32:44.120 --> 32:47.443
but now I won't be able to
observe her without laughing.

32:48.560 --> 32:49.573
Thanks a lot.

33:03.340 --> 33:04.310
That's Becky.

33:04.310 --> 33:05.213
She's got my back.

33:08.290 --> 33:10.780
One final thing about pawns.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.790
If a pawn manages to do something great,

33:13.790 --> 33:16.580
if it gets all the way to the other side,

33:16.580 --> 33:20.428
then it changes, turns into a queen.

33:20.428 --> 33:24.640
So a worthless little kid
can turn into a queen.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.250
Interesting.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.083
Don't get too excited.

33:27.083 --> 33:28.363
It almost never happens.

33:29.330 --> 33:32.653
Okay, now that you're actually
moving more than one piece,

33:33.970 --> 33:35.470
you gotta think strategically.

33:36.321 --> 33:37.980
Strategically?

33:37.980 --> 33:39.080
Yeah, you need a plan.

33:42.270 --> 33:46.188
When you walk out the door,
you have a plan, right?

33:46.188 --> 33:47.330
You don't just walk outside

33:47.330 --> 33:48.880
and wander around, do you?

33:48.880 --> 33:50.166
Uh, no.

33:50.166 --> 33:51.164
No.

33:51.164 --> 33:52.583
So, what's your plan?

33:54.310 --> 33:55.960
Um...

33:55.960 --> 33:57.933
to move me and my friends forward?

33:59.702 --> 34:01.206
All right.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.706
I guess that's a plan, barely,

34:04.060 --> 34:06.360
but you gotta keep an eye on the board,

34:06.360 --> 34:08.993
come up with a new plan if things change.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.853
But things always change.

34:14.000 --> 34:14.833
That's right.

34:15.770 --> 34:16.833
Things always change.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.960
So what do you do about that?

34:19.960 --> 34:22.652
I mean, what if you don't
want things to change?

34:24.179 --> 34:25.013
Tough.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.040
Forget it.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.690
I don't know why I would ask you.

34:31.110 --> 34:31.943
Hey, listen.

34:33.290 --> 34:34.632
Change isn't a bad thing.

34:36.380 --> 34:37.652
Sometimes it is.

34:46.806 --> 34:48.625
Man, when was the last
time we had a date night?

34:48.625 --> 34:50.730
I don't know. 1998?

34:50.730 --> 34:52.210
Oh, it feels that way, doesn't it?

34:52.210 --> 34:53.570
It probably has been a year.

34:53.570 --> 34:55.050
That's so bad.

34:55.050 --> 34:55.882
No, it's not bad.

34:55.882 --> 34:56.716
We're busy.

34:56.716 --> 34:58.340
Yeah. Everybody's busy, but you make time

34:58.340 --> 35:00.110
for the things that are important,

35:00.110 --> 35:01.000
and, you know, I can certainly

35:01.000 --> 35:03.263
take a night off every six months.

35:09.460 --> 35:10.810
You're not worried about
the babysitter, are you?

35:10.810 --> 35:11.760
No. No, no, no.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.286
She's fine.

35:13.286 --> 35:14.284
Come on.

35:14.284 --> 35:15.286
Okay.

35:15.286 --> 35:17.422
I told you not to move!

35:17.422 --> 35:18.943
You're a closet.

35:20.580 --> 35:21.783
Closets don't move.

35:22.726 --> 35:24.640
She's right.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.673
Closets don't move.

35:59.023 --> 36:00.540
Dad?

36:00.540 --> 36:01.373
Mom?

36:02.790 --> 36:04.480
Are you asleep?

36:04.480 --> 36:05.623
Why don't you answer?

36:11.201 --> 36:12.204
Yaya?

36:12.204 --> 36:13.420
Shh.

36:13.420 --> 36:15.193
Don't wake up your sister.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.833
Go back to sleep.

36:19.142 --> 36:21.803
But you're dead.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.773
Tell me something I don't know.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.800
What are you doing here?

36:30.420 --> 36:32.363
Sitting with you.

36:33.621 --> 36:35.760
What, that's a problem?

36:35.760 --> 36:36.963
Uh, no. No.

36:37.940 --> 36:39.833
I got no other plans,

36:41.230 --> 36:42.730
and I gotta keep an eye

36:42.730 --> 36:44.923
on that lazy father of yours.

36:45.930 --> 36:47.839
He's not lazy.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.090
Well... Heh.

36:49.090 --> 36:50.753
Go back to sleep.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.520
Yaya?

37:04.520 --> 37:07.807
Still here.

37:07.807 --> 37:10.973
You know, if you were
anyone else sitting there,

37:10.973 --> 37:13.193
I'd be pretty scared right now.

37:14.430 --> 37:16.163
I mean, you're dead.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.450
That would be really scary,

37:19.450 --> 37:21.500
to have a dead person sitting in my room.

37:22.890 --> 37:27.243
Mm, yes, that would be really scary.

37:28.700 --> 37:31.567
So are you a ghost?

37:31.567 --> 37:32.400
No. No, no.

37:33.776 --> 37:35.440
You know better than that.

37:35.440 --> 37:38.173
I'm just a pigment of your imagination.

37:39.070 --> 37:42.240
I always thought the word was "figment."

37:42.240 --> 37:45.713
Maxine, you don't correct Yayas.

37:47.380 --> 37:48.213
Okay.

37:51.190 --> 37:55.798
Well, good night, Yaya.

37:55.798 --> 37:57.631
Good night, matia mou.

38:00.829 --> 38:02.007
♪ Tic, tac, toe ♪

38:02.007 --> 38:03.869
♪ Gimme an X, gimme an O ♪

38:03.869 --> 38:06.668
♪ Gimme a three in a row ♪

38:06.668 --> 38:09.501
♪ Row, ship, boat ♪

38:10.460 --> 38:11.733
Hey, that's weird.

38:12.810 --> 38:14.270
Look at Olive.

38:14.270 --> 38:15.830
Yeah.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.000
Why isn't she with the rest

38:17.000 --> 38:18.973
of her catastrophic friends?

38:20.550 --> 38:21.750
Go over and talk to her.

38:22.652 --> 38:23.630
Why?

38:23.630 --> 38:26.363
You go over and talk to her if you want.

38:27.210 --> 38:28.420
No, you do it.

38:28.420 --> 38:29.630
You're prettier than me.

38:29.630 --> 38:30.780
She'll like you better.

38:31.973 --> 38:32.806
Okay.

38:35.053 --> 38:36.460
Tell her you like her drawings.

38:36.460 --> 38:37.460
She's proud of them.

38:43.992 --> 38:44.995
Cool.

38:44.995 --> 38:46.078
Cool animals.

39:09.870 --> 39:12.663
So, any ideas on your move?

39:13.630 --> 39:15.600
Why do you seem so excited today?

39:15.600 --> 39:17.210
You're never excited.

39:17.210 --> 39:18.533
Because I see a piece

39:18.533 --> 39:20.833
that's been left out
alone to fend for itself.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.767
So what are you gonna do?

39:27.040 --> 39:28.090
Becky's gonna take it

39:29.571 --> 39:30.571
like she took Olive.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.530
Wow.

39:39.530 --> 39:41.200
Downtown.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.800
I've been downtown,
like, twice in my life.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.070
What's it like down there?

39:46.070 --> 39:48.160
It must be mesmerizing.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.300
It's nice.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.760
I mean, it's a little
busier than it is up here.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.740
I wish I lived downtown.

39:53.740 --> 39:55.587
And I cannot believe your parents

39:55.587 --> 39:59.050
let you ride home on
the subway by yourself.

39:59.050 --> 40:01.340
That is totally scintillating.

40:01.340 --> 40:02.173
I guess.

40:02.173 --> 40:04.550
There's no way my mom
would let me do that.

40:04.550 --> 40:06.890
I'm not allowed on the
streets without a grown-up,

40:06.890 --> 40:09.150
and she won't let me
ride the subway at all.

40:09.150 --> 40:11.160
You've never been on the subway?

40:11.160 --> 40:13.672
Nobody I know gets to ride the subway.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.890
So do you want to come over to my place

40:15.890 --> 40:18.051
with your nanny on Friday?

40:18.051 --> 40:21.540
Uh, why don't we go somewhere fun instead?

40:21.540 --> 40:23.192
Home is so boring.

40:23.192 --> 40:25.180
Yeah, that's a stunning idea!

40:25.180 --> 40:27.230
Your nanny can take us
and drop me off at home

40:27.230 --> 40:28.531
when we're done.

40:28.531 --> 40:30.320
Uh, my nanny's no fun.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.140
She doesn't do anything.

40:32.140 --> 40:33.573
It's got to be your nanny.

40:34.910 --> 40:35.750
Okay.

40:35.750 --> 40:36.583
Becky!

40:38.530 --> 40:39.423
Gotta go.

40:40.290 --> 40:41.891
Your dad has a nice car.

40:41.891 --> 40:43.003
Dad?

40:44.550 --> 40:45.383
You're funny.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.380
The rook,

40:54.380 --> 40:56.480
also known as a castle.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.690
Cool.

40:57.690 --> 40:59.933
A good piece, useful piece.

40:59.933 --> 41:01.593
Now go learn about it.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.355
What are you talking about?

41:04.355 --> 41:05.640
Go out there.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.152
Find a castle.

41:07.152 --> 41:08.523
Learn how the piece moves.

41:09.590 --> 41:11.110
Let me get this straight.

41:11.110 --> 41:15.010
To learn how this piece
moves on a chessboard,

41:15.010 --> 41:17.651
I'm supposed to go look around
New York City for a castle?

41:17.651 --> 41:19.310
Right.

41:19.310 --> 41:22.650
And somehow that's going
to teach me something?

41:22.650 --> 41:24.250
Yeah, if you got your eyes open.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.230
Look, you can learn my way,

41:27.230 --> 41:29.310
or you can learn from somebody else.

41:29.310 --> 41:30.829
Well, can you at least give me a hint

41:30.829 --> 41:32.490
about what I'm looking for?

41:32.490 --> 41:33.323
A hint?

41:33.323 --> 41:35.710
You mean, like, is it
bigger than a bread box?

41:35.710 --> 41:37.730
Bigger than an Xbox?

41:37.730 --> 41:38.630
What's an Xbox?

41:38.630 --> 41:39.630
What's a bread box?

41:39.630 --> 41:40.690
Oh, get out of here.

41:45.608 --> 41:46.441
Xbox.

42:05.285 --> 42:08.465
It's gonna take a little imagination.

42:08.465 --> 42:09.850
Do you have a little imagination?

42:09.850 --> 42:11.460
I'm a 10-year-old girl.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.293
What do you think?

42:12.293 --> 42:14.550
Then stop being so literal.

42:14.550 --> 42:17.420
Chess player needs to think creatively.

42:17.420 --> 42:19.704
And don't come back till you find it.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.453
You need to be inspired.

42:22.740 --> 42:23.573
Inspired?

42:34.180 --> 42:36.950
Sweetie, I am sorry,
but we just can't do it.

42:36.950 --> 42:39.181
And I gotta get back to work, so kiss.

42:39.181 --> 42:40.080
Come on.

42:40.080 --> 42:40.913
Just one day.

42:40.913 --> 42:42.621
Honey, we can't afford a nanny.

42:42.621 --> 42:43.454
We just can't.

42:43.454 --> 42:45.580
Don't you want me to have playdates?

42:45.580 --> 42:46.840
Or would you rather I just be a hermit

42:46.840 --> 42:47.940
for the rest of my life?

42:47.940 --> 42:50.100
Of course we want you to have playdates.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.110
Well, other parents don't let their kids

42:52.110 --> 42:53.260
walk the streets alone.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.980
Look, it's great that you trust me.

42:56.980 --> 42:58.600
This isn't about you.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.680
I can't have a playdate without a nanny.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.480
Okay, Here's an idea.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.100
What if my sister picked you up one day?

43:05.100 --> 43:07.600
She said she'd be happy to
do it if we ever needed her.

43:07.600 --> 43:10.125
No. No one has their aunt pick them up.

43:10.125 --> 43:11.920
That's so uncool.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.480
What do you care what people think?

43:13.480 --> 43:14.690
That doesn't matter.

43:14.690 --> 43:16.163
Dad, I'm 10 years old.

43:16.163 --> 43:17.660
It matters.

43:17.660 --> 43:19.320
I need a nanny to pick me up,

43:19.320 --> 43:21.070
not my Aunt Diane.

43:21.070 --> 43:23.403
Why can't Aunt Diane be your nanny?

43:34.140 --> 43:36.050
Are you sure your nanny
is coming today, Max?

43:36.050 --> 43:38.150
You could always just
come over to our house.

43:38.150 --> 43:40.160
Oh, no, she's definitely coming.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.263
She's very reliable.

43:42.870 --> 43:45.930
Mom, you don't have to remain here.

43:45.930 --> 43:47.110
I'm sorry, honey.

43:47.110 --> 43:49.310
I know it's embarrassing to you,

43:49.310 --> 43:50.890
but I don't let my
daughter walk the streets

43:50.890 --> 43:52.200
with someone I haven't met.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.033
Hey, Max!

43:58.860 --> 43:59.693
Come on.

43:59.693 --> 44:00.640
You have to be my nanny.

44:00.640 --> 44:03.400
Oh, yeah, I heard, so I'm not your aunt.

44:03.400 --> 44:04.300
I'm just your nanny.

44:04.300 --> 44:05.464
Got it.

44:05.464 --> 44:06.297
And you can't be American.

44:06.297 --> 44:07.820
Nannies are never American,

44:07.820 --> 44:09.690
unless they're young dancers.

44:09.690 --> 44:11.690
I've got a dancer's body.

44:11.690 --> 44:13.170
They're in their 20s.

44:13.170 --> 44:14.803
I've got a dancer's body, okay?

44:18.180 --> 44:19.860
This is my nanny, Diane.

44:19.860 --> 44:21.960
Hi, Diane.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.290
Uh, (speaking in foreign language).

44:25.420 --> 44:27.233
Oh, no. No.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.520
(speaking in foreign language)

44:29.520 --> 44:33.320
Oh. Well, where are you from?

44:33.320 --> 44:34.860
Oh, I from.

44:34.860 --> 44:36.800
Eh, I from Kazakhstan.

44:42.696 --> 44:45.276
(speaking in foreign language)

44:45.276 --> 44:50.276
Um... Ahem.

44:50.870 --> 44:53.130
So, Diane,

44:53.130 --> 44:56.020
where do you take the girls today?

44:56.020 --> 44:57.960
Uh, I take girls,

44:57.960 --> 45:00.950
eh, wherever they want to go,

45:00.950 --> 45:03.000
except if it not safe.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.453
Then I do not take them.

45:06.450 --> 45:07.583
Excuse me one second.

45:10.413 --> 45:11.496
Is she drunk?

45:15.800 --> 45:18.063
Well, have fun.

45:21.130 --> 45:22.980
Call me at the first sign of trouble.

45:29.261 --> 45:31.844
(upbeat music)

46:07.039 --> 46:08.197
I mean, can you believe it?

46:08.197 --> 46:09.735
You know, I can't believe he'd do it.

46:09.735 --> 46:12.485
I still have to throw things out.

46:13.414 --> 46:15.664
He's watching the
decluttering show, I guess.

46:21.390 --> 46:23.263
Oh, I gotta refill my MetroCard.

46:25.520 --> 46:26.713
I forgot my wallet.

46:27.861 --> 46:29.083
Do you have any money?

46:30.390 --> 46:31.223
Jeez.

46:32.060 --> 46:33.220
Your mom's going to kill me.

46:33.220 --> 46:34.260
Okay.

46:34.260 --> 46:36.830
My student MetroCard can be
used once every 17 minutes,

46:36.830 --> 46:38.080
so we'll just wait for that.

46:38.080 --> 46:40.550
No. I'm not gonna use your
student MetroCard, okay?

46:40.550 --> 46:41.433
That's illegal.

46:42.380 --> 46:43.213
Come on.

46:43.213 --> 46:44.046
No one's watching.

46:44.046 --> 46:46.143
They have cameras everywhere.

46:46.143 --> 46:48.410
There aren't any cameras here.

46:48.410 --> 46:50.320
No, they disguise them, see?

46:50.320 --> 46:51.630
You can't trust 'em.

46:51.630 --> 46:52.463
You don't realize that.

46:52.463 --> 46:53.860
You didn't live through the '60s.

46:53.860 --> 46:54.803
Neither did you.

46:56.500 --> 46:57.420
Come on already.

46:57.420 --> 46:58.603
No, put that away!

46:59.800 --> 47:01.863
Okay. Then ask for some money.

47:04.330 --> 47:05.163
Excuse me.

47:07.230 --> 47:09.023
This is ridiculous.

47:09.023 --> 47:10.683
Excuse me!

47:11.560 --> 47:14.080
My aunt needs to borrow a couple dollars.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.670
You should be ashamed of yourself,

47:15.670 --> 47:18.390
bringing your little girl out here to beg!

47:18.390 --> 47:19.503
Disgraceful.

47:28.930 --> 47:31.200
I could've taken the subway by myself.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.560
I do it every day.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.070
No. Not when I'm supposed
to be watching you.

47:34.070 --> 47:35.147
I'd never hear the end of it.

47:35.147 --> 47:37.410
"Diane, just 'cause you
decided not to have kids

47:37.410 --> 47:38.873
doesn't mean you can just..."

47:40.270 --> 47:41.810
What?

47:41.810 --> 47:43.660
Inspired.

47:43.660 --> 47:44.493
What?

47:45.439 --> 47:47.359
It's a castle.

47:47.359 --> 47:48.192
Heh.

47:48.192 --> 47:49.910
No, that's a church.

47:49.910 --> 47:51.810
You don't have much of an imagination.

48:34.080 --> 48:34.943
This is strange.

48:36.840 --> 48:37.673
Yeah.

48:47.670 --> 48:49.763
I'm going to move him to here.

48:49.763 --> 48:51.713
Then next turn, I can capture the pawn.

48:53.976 --> 48:55.420
Good.

48:55.420 --> 48:57.930
Now I want you to learn
how to move the knight.

48:57.930 --> 49:01.130
Listen, Norman, this has been,

49:01.130 --> 49:03.780
uh, interesting,

49:03.780 --> 49:05.110
but you could save us both some time

49:05.110 --> 49:06.260
by just telling me how.

49:08.970 --> 49:12.380
I could teach you all the
rules of chess in two minutes,

49:12.380 --> 49:13.680
but the rules are nothing.

49:14.520 --> 49:16.733
What's important is how you see the board.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.270
Now tell me about the rook.

49:22.290 --> 49:24.880
It sweeps across the
board in straight lines.

49:24.880 --> 49:28.750
See? I'm teaching you how
to see the whole board,

49:28.750 --> 49:30.610
not just a single piece.

49:30.610 --> 49:32.283
Anybody can move a piece.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.890
Takes a city kid to make sense

49:34.890 --> 49:37.083
of what seems like chaos.

49:38.810 --> 49:42.980
And I could tell you
that this is a good move,

49:42.980 --> 49:44.930
but you would learn absolutely nothing.

49:46.530 --> 49:49.000
Is it better to earn five bucks

49:49.000 --> 49:50.620
or to find it in the street?

49:50.620 --> 49:52.440
Finding it in the street would be okay,

49:52.440 --> 49:53.950
especially if it kept
me from running around

49:53.950 --> 49:56.020
like a crazy person.

49:56.020 --> 49:57.580
You're not a crazy person.

49:57.580 --> 49:58.763
You're a weird person,

50:00.430 --> 50:02.500
like most good chess players.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.240
I'm not a good chess player.

50:04.240 --> 50:06.943
Not yet, but you might be someday

50:06.943 --> 50:08.563
if you learn my way.

50:10.400 --> 50:12.530
I gotta admit that was a pretty cool way

50:12.530 --> 50:13.730
to learn about the rook.

50:15.002 --> 50:16.963
How did you do that, anyway?

50:17.823 --> 50:18.656
Eh.

50:21.350 --> 50:22.750
So tell me about the knight.

50:24.550 --> 50:25.970
An unusual piece.

50:25.970 --> 50:27.323
Moves very strangely.

50:28.463 --> 50:30.110
How?

50:30.110 --> 50:33.190
Your board, your city.

50:33.190 --> 50:34.323
So what am I supposed to do,

50:34.323 --> 50:36.940
go look for a knight or a horse?

50:36.940 --> 50:38.180
Figure it out yourself.

50:38.180 --> 50:39.423
That's the whole point.

50:42.260 --> 50:44.837
Don't let life happen to you.

50:44.837 --> 50:46.373
You happen to life.

50:48.965 --> 50:49.823
Now get out of here.

50:51.910 --> 50:52.743
Scram.

50:59.786 --> 51:02.369
(upbeat music)

51:17.560 --> 51:18.743
You look like a knight.

51:20.420 --> 51:21.253
Okay.

51:22.590 --> 51:24.350
Can I ask you a question?

51:24.350 --> 51:26.270
Yeah, her name's Andromeda.

51:26.270 --> 51:27.842
Who?

51:27.842 --> 51:29.279
It's the horse.

51:29.279 --> 51:31.510
That's what you were gonna ask me, right?

51:31.510 --> 51:32.893
Um, no.

51:33.750 --> 51:36.933
I wanted to ask how you, uh, move.

51:37.861 --> 51:39.230
How I move?

51:39.230 --> 51:40.690
Yeah.

51:40.690 --> 51:43.293
Do you have a special way you move?

51:44.850 --> 51:47.400
I don't know what you're
talking about, kid.

51:47.400 --> 51:48.470
Right.

51:48.470 --> 51:49.953
Well, sorry.

51:52.710 --> 51:56.663
Max, that would've been too easy,

51:58.080 --> 51:59.670
but here's a clue.

51:59.670 --> 52:02.170
You look for horses that really move.

52:34.287 --> 52:35.420
Hey, bug, stop running back and forth.

52:35.420 --> 52:37.820
You know how much Mr.
Shawn downstairs hates it.

52:41.983 --> 52:42.816
Hey, Bug!

52:42.816 --> 52:44.180
Do you want us all to go to jail?

52:44.180 --> 52:47.293
Kids don't go to jail,
Papa, they go to juvie.

52:49.570 --> 52:51.263
30,000.

52:51.263 --> 52:53.130
What's that, a math problem?

52:53.130 --> 52:54.470
Sort of.

52:54.470 --> 52:55.540
How long do you think it would take

52:55.540 --> 52:57.193
to count to 30,000, Papa?

52:58.121 --> 52:59.340
I don't know.

52:59.340 --> 53:00.823
Couple hours, maybe, why?

53:02.630 --> 53:05.630
Because that's how many days
an average person lives 30,000.

53:07.970 --> 53:09.490
That's it.

53:09.490 --> 53:13.313
And I've already used up,
like 4,000 days, almost.

53:16.030 --> 53:17.150
Maxie, I...

53:18.320 --> 53:20.170
I don't know what to tell you, honey.

53:21.221 --> 53:22.661
Nothing, Papa.

53:22.661 --> 53:23.494
Nothing.

53:27.056 --> 53:28.063
Papa.

53:28.063 --> 53:29.061
Yeah, Maxie.

53:29.061 --> 53:30.183
Where are those horses racing?

53:31.250 --> 53:33.213
Oh, that's from today's races at Aqueduct.

53:34.110 --> 53:35.730
Where's Aqueduct?

53:35.730 --> 53:36.593
It's in Queens.

53:42.570 --> 53:44.010
This is ridiculous.

53:44.010 --> 53:45.440
Look, I asked you because I thought

53:45.440 --> 53:46.620
you wouldn't be scared to do this.

53:46.620 --> 53:48.180
If you want to go back.

53:48.180 --> 53:50.640
Please, don't play your
fourth-grade mind games on me.

53:50.640 --> 53:51.473
Let's go.

53:58.303 --> 54:00.794
So what's happening at PS 41 these days?

54:00.794 --> 54:02.830
Same as usual.

54:02.830 --> 54:04.880
Oh, uh, there's a new gym teacher.

54:04.880 --> 54:05.970
Coach Z left?

54:05.970 --> 54:06.803
Yeah.

54:06.803 --> 54:08.680
And, uh, the new gym teacher's a girl.

54:08.680 --> 54:11.520
Wow, that's cool.

54:11.520 --> 54:13.519
No, it's lame.

54:13.519 --> 54:15.903
Whoever heard of a girl gym teacher?

54:16.810 --> 54:18.610
Oh, and the chess team

54:18.610 --> 54:20.780
just finished second
at city championships.

54:20.780 --> 54:21.720
Really?

54:21.720 --> 54:23.599
Maybe I'll play against them someday.

54:23.599 --> 54:24.432
Heh.

54:24.432 --> 54:25.265
They'll kick your butt.

54:25.265 --> 54:26.098
They're good.

54:35.730 --> 54:36.973
I said I was sorry.

54:38.620 --> 54:40.266
Could have made us some fake IDs.

54:40.266 --> 54:41.870
I'm sorry.

54:41.870 --> 54:44.870
I didn't realize you
had to be 18 to get in.

54:44.870 --> 54:49.210
Well, will you at least tell
me now why we came here?

54:49.210 --> 54:52.050
We came to watch the horses.

54:52.050 --> 54:54.300
Of course we came here
to watch the horses.

54:54.300 --> 54:55.680
Why?

54:55.680 --> 54:58.330
To see how they move,

54:58.330 --> 54:59.413
what direction.

55:00.490 --> 55:04.200
They move around the track in a circle.

55:04.200 --> 55:06.562
Well, it's not exactly a circle.

55:06.562 --> 55:07.395
Okay. An oval.

55:10.520 --> 55:13.020
Please don't tell me that's
all you needed to know.

55:17.540 --> 55:19.170
Only $1.00!

55:19.170 --> 55:20.003
Get it here!

55:20.003 --> 55:20.836
Get it now!

55:20.836 --> 55:24.130
Get it while it's still on
ice, ladies and gentlemen.

55:24.130 --> 55:27.043
So, moving in an oval.

55:30.082 --> 55:31.570
You know, some people might
think it was a bad idea

55:31.570 --> 55:34.040
to send a 10 year-old-kid to a racetrack.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.450
I didn't send you to a racetrack.

55:35.450 --> 55:37.320
You sent yourself.

55:37.320 --> 55:38.900
It's a small horse.

55:38.900 --> 55:41.240
You have to make a small oval.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.433
Think of a horse in the city.

55:45.648 --> 55:46.481
It can't cut through a block.

55:46.481 --> 55:48.883
It's gotta make turns at the corner.

55:50.190 --> 55:51.490
Try going a different way.

55:57.070 --> 55:58.033
Okay. I got it.

55:59.112 --> 55:59.945
What's next?

56:25.123 --> 56:27.580
I want to see your diarrhea.

56:27.580 --> 56:28.413
You mean diary.

56:45.663 --> 56:50.300
Mmm, macaroni and dirt, my favorite.

56:50.300 --> 56:53.980
Not macaroni and dirt,
Papa, macaroni and cheese!

56:53.980 --> 56:56.550
Mm-mm-mm. I saw Mama
cooking it this morning,

56:56.550 --> 56:59.683
and this is definitely macaroni and dirt.

56:59.683 --> 57:01.083
You're silly, Papa.

57:02.780 --> 57:07.350
Papa, why doesn't Mama eat
dinner with us anymore?

57:07.350 --> 57:09.320
Because Mama's gotta work, bug.

57:09.320 --> 57:11.230
What's Mama's work?

57:11.230 --> 57:14.040
I've told you before,
bug, she cooks for people.

57:14.040 --> 57:15.600
She cooks for us.

57:15.600 --> 57:18.780
Why does she have to cook
for other people, too?

57:18.780 --> 57:21.860
Well, it's complicated, honey.

57:21.860 --> 57:23.730
It's not that complicated.

57:23.730 --> 57:26.330
Jez, other people give her
money to cook for them.

57:26.330 --> 57:27.800
Unless you have any money to give her,

57:27.800 --> 57:29.560
she can't just cook for you.

57:29.560 --> 57:30.810
I have some money.

57:30.810 --> 57:31.730
No, you don't.

57:31.730 --> 57:32.563
Yes, I do.

57:32.563 --> 57:35.107
I have a nickel and a penny and a dollar.

57:35.107 --> 57:35.940
That's not real money.

57:35.940 --> 57:36.907
That's just like.

57:36.907 --> 57:38.120
Jesus, Max, stop!

57:38.120 --> 57:39.933
Yeah, Max, cheeses!

57:41.010 --> 57:42.957
Hey, hey, both of you!

57:43.819 --> 57:45.383
The important thing is
that both of you girls know

57:45.383 --> 57:46.610
that your Mama loves you more

57:46.610 --> 57:49.267
than anything in the world, okay?

57:49.267 --> 57:52.488
And when you eat the food
that she cooks for you,

57:52.488 --> 57:55.033
it's like you're eating her love.

57:57.420 --> 57:59.328
That's kinda gross.

57:59.328 --> 58:01.245
I'm not hungry anymore.

58:07.750 --> 58:08.583
Okay.

58:08.583 --> 58:09.416
You're ready.

58:10.510 --> 58:13.010
Make your own move, any piece you like.

58:13.010 --> 58:14.534
Are we going to play?

58:14.534 --> 58:16.400
No, we're just going to work on openings,

58:16.400 --> 58:18.690
just the first five moves.

58:18.690 --> 58:21.210
But I'm ready to play a real game.

58:21.210 --> 58:23.510
I know how to move all the pieces.

58:23.510 --> 58:25.030
Fine. If you're ready to play a real game,

58:25.030 --> 58:27.253
then you don't need me anymore.

58:29.060 --> 58:30.660
I know how to drive a car.

58:30.660 --> 58:32.660
Doesn't mean I'm ready for the Indy 500.

58:35.100 --> 58:36.213
What do I move first?

58:37.068 --> 58:38.450
What are you, two years old?

58:38.450 --> 58:40.093
Pick a piece, and move it.

58:44.010 --> 58:45.420
Brilliant move.

58:45.420 --> 58:47.620
People will be talking
about it for decades.

58:55.470 --> 58:59.880
Now, we already talked about
the Earth and the moon, right?

58:59.880 --> 59:04.880
The sun is 4.5 billion years old.

59:05.940 --> 59:08.483
Know what else is 4.5 billion years old?

59:09.332 --> 59:10.290
What?

59:10.290 --> 59:11.243
Those shoes.

59:20.280 --> 59:23.880
Hey, do you want do some
more exploring today?

59:23.880 --> 59:25.830
Well, I kinda have to play chess today.

59:26.890 --> 59:28.340
I can play chess.

59:28.340 --> 59:29.380
For real?

59:29.380 --> 59:31.686
Like, can you play well?

59:31.686 --> 59:34.010
No, but I can play a little.

59:34.010 --> 59:36.390
Great. Will your mom let you come?

59:36.390 --> 59:39.023
I told her your ludicrous
nanny was picking us up.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.463
I don't think that word means
what you think it means.

59:45.756 --> 59:48.090
You ever think about
how random things are?

59:48.090 --> 59:50.413
I mean, Isabella could
have been my best friend

59:50.413 --> 59:51.513
instead of you.

59:55.490 --> 59:56.573
I doubt that.

59:58.230 --> 01:00:00.680
What I'm saying is that everything in life

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.660
is just...

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.373
I don't know, luck.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:06.450
Those people could have been my parents.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.240
That could have been my grandmother.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:18.097
Or I might have had two dads

01:00:20.264 --> 01:00:21.723
and maybe lived somewhere else.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.150
For that matter, I could have been a boy.

01:00:30.953 --> 01:00:32.020
Eww.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.510
I mean, why is your name Becky?

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.830
Because Rebecca is too long and boring.

01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:38.320
What's your point?

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.673
Nothing. Come on.

01:00:46.937 --> 01:00:48.107
Great.

01:00:48.107 --> 01:00:49.860
Two six-year-olds.

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.300
That should equal one 12 year-old.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.800
We're not six years.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.270
Don't bother.

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.770
Here's how I'm starting today.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.190
Pawn to E3.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:02.907
Almost as earthshaking
as your last opening.

01:01:02.907 --> 01:01:03.910
E3?

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.660
That's how you describe moves.

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.057
The squares go across from A to H,

01:01:08.057 --> 01:01:10.207
and the squares up and
down go from 1 to 8,

01:01:11.348 --> 01:01:13.130
so that square is E3.

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:15.150
Hey, I'm impressed.

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:17.050
You can count to eight.

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:17.883
Just ignore him.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.303
Not terrible.

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:40.513
Actually, not terrible.

01:01:48.585 --> 01:01:49.418
Papa!

01:01:54.747 --> 01:01:56.060
Max?

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:56.893
Max.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:01:59.953
Hey.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.793
Come on, Maxie.

01:02:02.793 --> 01:02:03.626
Talk to me.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:15.820
Did you know that the sun
is 4.5 billion years old

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.913
and that in another 5 billion
years, it'll burn out?

01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:23.610
I don't think we need to
worry about that, honey.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:24.443
Why not?

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.743
Because we won't be here.

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:29.943
But where will I be, Dad?

01:02:31.035 --> 01:02:32.883
Where will I be in 5 billion years?

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.963
I don't know, honey.

01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:40.910
But I can promise you one thing.

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:45.053
Wherever you are, I'm gonna be there, too.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:46.903
Huh?

01:02:51.536 --> 01:02:53.912
How 'bout a little beard scratch?

01:02:53.912 --> 01:02:54.745
Heh.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.820
Dad.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.150
Yeah, honey?

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.393
I wish I didn't think about these things.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.170
I know, honey.

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:12.993
I think about 'em sometimes, too.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.270
But you know when I never do?

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:19.390
When I'm with you and your sister.

01:03:20.643 --> 01:03:22.203
That must mean something, right?

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.663
Good night, sweetie.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.673
Hey.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.970
Hey!

01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:03.803
What's going on?

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.847
I told him we could only
play the first five moves,

01:04:06.847 --> 01:04:08.513
but he wouldn't stop.

01:04:09.477 --> 01:04:10.933
We'll stop when I'm ahead.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.540
It doesn't look like that
is ever gonna happen.

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:16.373
Scram.

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:18.343
Scram!

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:20.283
Come on!

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.013
All right,

01:04:23.013 --> 01:04:25.203
we're gonna play the first 20 moves each.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.740
Try not to lose before then.

01:04:36.378 --> 01:04:37.278
Hello.

01:04:37.278 --> 01:04:38.111
Hey.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.155
How were the girls?

01:04:42.155 --> 01:04:42.988
Oh, fine.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.240
Do you remember when Max was born,

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.210
like five minutes ago?

01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:51.610
I remember three minutes
ago, when Jez was born.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.390
They're closing the restaurant.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.210
When?

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:01.150
It's already done.

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:03.500
You know, apparently
they've been losing money.

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:08.963
But they offered me a
job at their other place.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.053
In Boston?

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:15.330
No, no, no. You could get a
job at another restaurant here.

01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:16.556
There's nothing out there.

01:05:16.556 --> 01:05:18.180
You know how many people
were coming in every day

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.020
looking for work?

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.130
It's just.

01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:22.833
We are really lucky they
offered me this Boston gig.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.400
Well, then you could not
work for a while, then.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.900
Yeah, so we can not pay
Max's tuition for a while.

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.160
I know how to rotate my schedule.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.390
I can come back twice a month.

01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:36.260
The Chinese bus is only $15.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.860
They need me to start next week.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.407
Well, you thought of everything then.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.323
Are you mad at me?

01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:49.060
You think I want to do this?

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:50.373
You know, I think you don't
want to talk about it,

01:05:50.373 --> 01:05:51.630
is what I think.

01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:54.060
What is the point of
going round and round?

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.790
You're gonna change your mind five times

01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:58.193
when we both know this
is the right thing to do.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.908
Great. Fine.

01:06:00.908 --> 01:06:02.260
Fine. It's not like the kids

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.060
see you around here anyway, so fine.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.153
Oh.

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:13.343
If you had a decent job,

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.950
I wouldn't have to do this.

01:06:33.129 --> 01:06:33.962
Mama?

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:38.785
Who's awake down there?

01:06:38.785 --> 01:06:40.368
What are you doing?

01:06:44.427 --> 01:06:47.373
You have tiger scratches.

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:52.503
I also have a secret I want to tell you.

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:56.993
I love somebody in this room.

01:06:58.062 --> 01:06:58.895
Is it me?

01:06:59.769 --> 01:07:01.617
You guessed it.

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:04.693
Actually, I love two people in this room.

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:07.987
I love you, and I love Max.

01:07:09.653 --> 01:07:13.147
You also love yourself,
so that's three people.

01:07:13.147 --> 01:07:16.320
Right, but I love you and Max

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.313
and Papa even more than I love myself.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.530
Me, too, Mama.

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:26.670
I can't stop loving you.

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:27.883
Ohh.

01:07:27.883 --> 01:07:29.683
How'd I get so lucky?

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.990
Tell me a story, Mama.

01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:35.407
Okay. What about?

01:07:37.215 --> 01:07:42.215
About Cinderella, Ariel,
Spider-Man, and Max.

01:07:44.487 --> 01:07:45.723
And Max, okay.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:51.760
Well, one day, Cinderella, Ariel, and Max

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.190
were walking through the park,

01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:58.090
and all of a sudden,
Spider-Man went swinging by.

01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:00.423
And Spider-Man stopped
as soon as he saw Max,

01:08:00.423 --> 01:08:04.907
because he knew he needed her
for a very important mission.

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:08.090
I wouldn't have done that.

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.630
So you've learned how to move the pieces.

01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:13.500
I've been taking lessons.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.960
I'm ready to play you.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.180
Who've you been studying with?

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.520
He can't be better than my teacher,

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.880
Vadim Alexeyevich.

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.510
I'm sure you know who that is.

01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:23.020
He teaches me in Russian.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.540
You speak Russian?

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:25.520
Not really,

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.510
but he's such a genius,
it doesn't even matter.

01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:31.410
Anyway, why should I play you?

01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:32.750
What's in it for me?

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:35.960
At this school, I'm here, and you're here.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.990
You're scared.

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:38.500
Please.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.630
Okay.

01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:41.330
If you win, I'll leave the school.

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:44.600
And if you win,

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.540
which could only happen
if I go into a coma.

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.899
Then you have to leave the school.

01:09:48.899 --> 01:09:50.790
Not a chance.

01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:51.729
Okay.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.502
Then you have to stop bothering me.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.460
That's pretty broad.

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.160
I'll stop insulting you in public.

01:09:59.450 --> 01:10:00.363
That's acceptable.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.297
Okay.

01:10:08.297 --> 01:10:10.400
Today I'm gonna go first.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.619
Listen, Norman, I need
to tell you something.

01:10:12.619 --> 01:10:13.580
Tell me later.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:14.413
Move first.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.590
I'm going to play a real chess match.

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:18.560
The hell you are.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.880
No, I am.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.830
I'm going to play against someone else.

01:10:23.006 --> 01:10:23.839
What?

01:10:23.839 --> 01:10:26.174
I'm going to play a real chess match

01:10:26.174 --> 01:10:27.420
against someone else.

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.505
I told you you weren't ready.

01:10:29.505 --> 01:10:31.123
Well, I thought I was.

01:10:34.579 --> 01:10:36.579
Then I guess we're done.

01:11:08.006 --> 01:11:08.919
Hey, Maxie.

01:11:08.919 --> 01:11:09.752
How was school today?

01:11:09.752 --> 01:11:10.863
It was fine.

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.334
Yeah? What'd you do?

01:11:13.334 --> 01:11:15.540
The usual,

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.188
nothing.

01:11:17.188 --> 01:11:18.583
I see.

01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:23.593
Hey, Maxie, do you like your new school?

01:11:24.729 --> 01:11:27.553
You're not supposed to like school, Papa.

01:11:27.553 --> 01:11:28.386
Oh, really?

01:11:28.386 --> 01:11:30.343
At best, you're supposed to tolerate it.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.253
Okay, then.

01:11:32.253 --> 01:11:34.393
Do you tolerate your new school?

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:36.253
I tolerate it.

01:11:37.257 --> 01:11:39.303
That's good,

01:11:39.303 --> 01:11:40.513
I guess.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.960
You know, parents, they always think

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.110
they know better than their kids.

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.943
Duh.

01:11:46.943 --> 01:11:49.680
And they do for a while,

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.870
but pretty soon you're
gonna be coming home

01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:55.760
with math homework that
I don't understand,

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.620
that you're gonna know the
right answer way before I do.

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:00.033
You know what I mean?

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.283
I'm only doing multiplication.

01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:05.803
It's a metaphor.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.280
Oh.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.430
I don't like metaphors.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.153
All right, listen.

01:12:14.153 --> 01:12:15.350
I'll be back in a few
minutes, okay, honey?

01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:16.933
You call me if you need me.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.403
Sleep.

01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:38.230
Sleep, matia mou.

01:12:39.876 --> 01:12:41.576
I might have made a mistake, Yaya.

01:12:43.188 --> 01:12:44.523
Everybody makes mistakes.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.823
Your mother married your father.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.950
Why do you keep doing that?

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.081
Habit.

01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:57.620
Don't worry about it.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:00.453
Make the best choice you can.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.650
That's what your mother did
when she went to Boston.

01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:06.253
She made her best.

01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:11.193
You make a choice, then go on.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.243
Life's too short.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.053
Compared to what?

01:13:17.617 --> 01:13:19.120
What do you mean?

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.990
I mean, compare our lives

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:23.260
to the life of a spider.

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.310
They must think we live forever.

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:28.130
Huh. You're right, matia mou.

01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:34.513
Life is also very, very long.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.983
So what should I do?

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.163
You know what I'm gonna say.

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:47.140
Yes.

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.520
Now go to sleep, matia mou.

01:13:55.411 --> 01:13:57.244
Karaniecta, matia mou.

01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:26.550
Look, it's my life, not yours.

01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:28.700
I'm entitled to play
against somebody else.

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:33.483
Seriously, the silent treatment?

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:35.783
Now who's the six-year-old?

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.870
I need to start making my own decisions,

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:43.710
but I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you in advance, Norman.

01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:44.660
That was a mistake.

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:47.563
This is not what I expected.

01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:51.260
This is your great teacher?

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.210
She called you Norman.

01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:53.310
What's your last name?

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:56.900
It doesn't speak.

01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.240
Why am I not surprised?

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.240
His name is Norman Wallach.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.830
(speaking in foreign language)

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:05.750
That's my Tibetan nanny, Tashi.

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:08.200
My parents insist I only
speak Mandarin with her.

01:15:13.585 --> 01:15:15.840
I have tae kwon do class now.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.920
Let's play tomorrow here.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.570
I want Norman to see me beat you.

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.860
I'll bring the clocks.

01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:30.193
She's the one you're gonna play against?

01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:34.980
You gotta beat her.

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.510
Tell me about it.

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:38.890
She said she's bringing clocks.

01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:40.200
What does that mean?

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.720
Chess clocks.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.553
You only get a certain

01:15:42.553 --> 01:15:43.790
amount of time to make all your moves.

01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:45.930
It makes the game move faster.

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:47.490
I always liked that you can control

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:49.360
how fast the game changed.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.590
Hey, look, chess is change.

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:55.763
It'd be pretty boring if
the pieces never moved.

01:15:55.763 --> 01:15:58.983
But sometimes you want
things to stay the same.

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:04.028
You know that great
pizza place on West 11th?

01:16:04.028 --> 01:16:04.861
Sure.

01:16:05.972 --> 01:16:07.690
I been there a hundred times.

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:09.659
Seems like that place
has been around forever.

01:16:09.659 --> 01:16:10.780
Yeah, it has been.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.760
But sooner or later, it'll close.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.932
Every place has to, eventually.

01:16:14.932 --> 01:16:17.733
You just have to enjoy it while it's here.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:25.020
Enough with the metaphors.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:26.530
Then listen.

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:29.540
You can't just use the
same pieces you always use.

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.090
Find new ones.

01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:32.390
Look for one that could be

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:34.393
more valuable than you think it is.

01:16:43.897 --> 01:16:44.980
You can't lose.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:45.813
You think you're gonna lose,

01:16:45.813 --> 01:16:48.163
give me a signal, and
I'll knock the board over.

01:16:49.278 --> 01:16:50.111
I'm serious.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:52.993
Back in a sec.

01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:56.363
Here's the plan.

01:16:56.363 --> 01:16:58.238
I'm going to pretend to
be blind, and you ask.

01:16:58.238 --> 01:16:59.071
No.

01:16:59.071 --> 01:17:00.890
Come on, I'll go 50-50 with you.

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:01.996
You're underutilized.

01:17:01.996 --> 01:17:03.540
Huh?

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.373
Come with me.

01:17:17.275 --> 01:17:20.025
All right, 6 to 1 1/2.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.173
That can't be right.

01:17:27.033 --> 01:17:28.783
All right, 164 to 41.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:30.849
What?

01:17:30.849 --> 01:17:32.472
Ooh!

01:17:32.472 --> 01:17:33.305
What's the count?

01:17:33.305 --> 01:17:36.763
It's, uh, 10,016 to 2,504.

01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:38.700
Or it's eight to two.

01:17:39.724 --> 01:17:41.470
It's about as simple as I'm gonna make it.

01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:42.770
This is B-ball, after all.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.713
I don't get it.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.740
The city is going to help me beat her.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.073
Go ahead. You're first.

01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:25.810
It's eight to two.

01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:28.761
This is B-ball, after all.

01:18:28.761 --> 01:18:29.594
So, B4.

01:18:37.238 --> 01:18:39.190
You know, that pawn is you.

01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:40.387
What?

01:18:40.387 --> 01:18:41.260
(speaking in foreign language)

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:42.480
He's not allowed to coach you.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.450
It doesn't matter.

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:45.050
I have no idea what he's saying.

01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:32.940
Remember, your board, your city.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.080
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.510
You're a sucky teacher.

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:38.940
Go back to the suburbs where you belong.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.017
I'm from the Upper West Side, if you.

01:19:40.017 --> 01:19:42.713
Like I said, go back to the suburbs.

01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:46.340
I'm sure they never heard of
the Mexican defense there.

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.590
There's no such thing
as the Mexican defense.

01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:49.423
Says you.

01:19:54.342 --> 01:19:58.259
(singing in foreign language)

01:20:05.628 --> 01:20:06.545
C, C, C, C.

01:20:08.215 --> 01:20:09.048
C4.

01:20:49.656 --> 01:20:50.989
Pawn takes pawn.

01:21:02.164 --> 01:21:06.081
(speaking in foreign language)

01:21:07.387 --> 01:21:09.300
I wish I understood him.

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.820
Checkmate in three moves.

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:13.703
Unless you find the one move
that wins the game for you.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.970
Hey, he said it.

01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:19.819
I'm just translating.

01:21:19.819 --> 01:21:21.110
You don't speak Russian.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:22.430
Oh.

01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:26.347
(speaking in foreign language)

01:21:28.099 --> 01:21:29.553
I don't see it.

01:21:29.553 --> 01:21:30.456
Look harder.

01:21:30.456 --> 01:21:31.408
I don't see it.

01:21:31.408 --> 01:21:32.308
Look harder.

01:21:32.308 --> 01:21:33.720
You have 20 seconds to make your move,

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.750
or you lose.

01:21:50.203 --> 01:21:52.120
I do not get that.

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.078
10 seconds.

01:21:53.078 --> 01:21:54.745
Take responsibility.

01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:57.113
You happen to life.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:00.030
Of course.

01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:01.970
I'm going to turn into a queen.

01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:03.968
My pawn will become a queen in two moves.

01:22:03.968 --> 01:22:06.500
Then checkmate.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.400
She can't stop me.

01:22:10.642 --> 01:22:11.853
You're gonna win!

01:22:11.853 --> 01:22:12.853
Put it down!

01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:22.120
What's wrong? Is there
a problem with the move?

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:22.953
No.

01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:29.840
Congratulations.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.040
Enjoy school without me.

01:22:46.304 --> 01:22:47.721
Very good player.

01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:56.166
I don't understand.

01:22:57.090 --> 01:22:58.543
She's coming back to PS 41.

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:01.380
Just when I was about to win,

01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:03.530
I realized that I didn't want to.

01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:05.140
You didn't want to win?

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:08.260
No, I didn't want to go back
to the Blackstone Academy.

01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:11.930
Nothing against it, it's just
I've got a fantastic school

01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:14.170
that's a five-minute-walk from my house.

01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:15.353
I love it there.

01:23:15.353 --> 01:23:17.053
It's my neighborhood school.

01:23:18.737 --> 01:23:21.103
That's what a real city
kid would do, isn't it?

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:25.740
Plus they've got the second-best
chess team in the city.

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.698
Maybe I can put them over the top.

01:23:27.698 --> 01:23:28.612
Yeah.

01:23:28.612 --> 01:23:30.211
Yes, I do.

01:23:30.211 --> 01:23:31.044
You do not.

01:23:31.044 --> 01:23:33.330
That means your wish
will, in fact, come true

01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:34.929
18 years from now.

01:23:34.929 --> 01:23:35.846
- Mama!

01:23:35.846 --> 01:23:36.945
You're back!

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:38.195
Ohh! Hi, honey!

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:44.213
Oh, I couldn't be away from my girls.

01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:29.900
Yaya.

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:31.647
What, you're surprised?

01:24:33.170 --> 01:24:35.650
I wasn't sure I'd see you again.

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:37.083
This is the last time.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.603
You don't need me no more.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.593
I'll always need you.

01:24:41.593 --> 01:24:44.860
Oh, no, that didn't come out right,

01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:46.153
but you know what I mean.

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:49.730
Thank you, Yaya.

01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:52.400
Everything worked out okay with your help.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.943
You did it all yourself.

01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:59.573
But I want to answer
that question of yours.

01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:02.859
About why things have to change?

01:25:02.859 --> 01:25:03.692
Hmm.

01:25:03.692 --> 01:25:04.983
I think I know the answer.

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:07.253
Tell me, matia mou.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.970
Because sometimes a great old pizza place

01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:14.043
has to close so that a new one can open.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.733
I hate metaphors.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:25.023
Say hello to Norman for me.

01:25:47.179 --> 01:25:48.585
What do they want?

01:25:48.585 --> 01:25:49.660
They're trying to convince me to come back

01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:52.533
to the Blackstone Academy
after I graduate from PS 41.

01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:55.530
You'll have your choice of schools.

01:25:57.010 --> 01:25:58.553
They also want you to teach them.

01:25:59.528 --> 01:26:00.893
They're not city kids.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:03.450
Maybe we can teach them how to be.

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.293
I guess I could teach you all together.

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:13.473
Three six-year-olds
almost makes a grown-up.

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.583
We're not six.

01:26:15.583 --> 01:26:16.416
He knows.

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:20.310
We'll start tomorrow.

01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:21.420
Three kids at once.

01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:22.523
I must be an idiot.

01:26:23.666 --> 01:26:25.516
It's lucky for you I'm such a softie.

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.323
Get out of here!

01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:33.293
Hey, Shmuel!

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.200
Don't worry about the next game.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.263
Enjoy this one.

01:26:41.576 --> 01:26:42.910
Know what I mean?

01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:44.050
Yeah.

01:26:44.050 --> 01:26:45.580
I'll try.

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.523
I'm going to enjoy beating
you, that's for sure.

01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:51.430
You couldn't beat me

01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:55.710
if I gave you a bag of
oranges, three hammers,

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:58.810
a baseball bat, and the Brooklyn Dodgers!

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:10.033
Anybody want to play some chess?

01:27:10.033 --> 01:27:12.616
(upbeat music)

01:28:40.112 --> 01:28:41.753
