01:04.664 --> 01:08.464
What's that?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.296
It sounds like the garbageman.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.898
Oh? On Tuesday?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.104
Maybe they changed the schedule.

01:21.214 --> 01:24.308
Oh, shit.

01:38.465 --> 01:41.525
<i>Oh! Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!</i>

01:41.634 --> 01:43.625
<i>Hey! Hold it up, you guys.</i>

01:53.113 --> 01:55.377
I was afraid you'd miss me.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.808
Don't worry. We won't.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.967
<i> Now that is American
workmanship.</i>

02:18.071 --> 02:21.529
You think the Japanese invented that?
Bullshit. We did.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.371
Oh, for a while there we lost it,
but we got it back.

02:24.477 --> 02:28.709
- I like Cadillacs.
- You like Cadillacs? Come around,
brother, get in this Cadillac.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.214
You're gonna love it.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.216
This is style and beauty.

02:34.487 --> 02:38.048
Comfy, right? Oh, I know what
you're gonna say. That's vinyl.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.150
<i>Take it from me, you don't
want leather, brother. Leather's hot.</i>

02:41.261 --> 02:44.719
It's uncomfortable. It cracks. Nothing but trouble.
Look at the headroom in here.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.766
A guy like you is not gonna have any problem.

02:47.867 --> 02:51.428
<i>Go ahead, start it up.
Listen to that. That's power.</i>

02:51.538 --> 02:54.439
- That's performance.
- You know what I like best?

02:54.541 --> 02:58.443
- What's that?
- The price.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.570
Hey! Wait a minute!

03:00.680 --> 03:02.773
<i>You can't drive that car in here!</i>

03:27.540 --> 03:30.441
Hey, guys, how's it going?

03:30.543 --> 03:32.511
Workin'. Workin'.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.402
Oh, Daddy, put me down!

05:38.504 --> 05:40.904
I surrender. I surrender.

07:27.046 --> 07:29.014
I love you too.

07:43.262 --> 07:46.197
Here come the sandwiches.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.527
Why don't they just call him
"Girl George"?

07:50.636 --> 07:52.604
It would cut down all the confusion.

07:52.705 --> 07:55.503
Oh, Dad, that's so old.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.171
When I was a boy and rock and roll
came to East Germany...

08:02.281 --> 08:04.306
the Communists said
it was subversive.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.049
Maybe they were right.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.958
- What's in this?
- You don't want to know.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.737
Dad, what's wrong?

08:40.385 --> 08:43.616
What's that Army helicopter doing here?
You said you wouldn't go away again.

08:43.722 --> 08:47.750
- You said you were through.
- I'm not going anywhere.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.228
Promise?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.596
I promise.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.410
Jackson. Harris.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.489
<i>Secure the area.</i>

09:53.926 --> 09:56.486
John?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.496
John, are you in there?

10:00.933 --> 10:03.993
John, come on out.
It's Kirby.

10:05.905 --> 10:10.865
- I know.
- Silent and smooth, just like always.

10:10.977 --> 10:14.640
- I better be. You taught me.
- I'm getting a little rusty.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.910
<i>- What's going on?
- Jenny, how are you?</i>

10:18.017 --> 10:20.008
Hi.

10:21.754 --> 10:25.690
- Jenny, I need to talk to your dad. Okay?
- Yeah? Got a warrant?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.986
- Very funny.
- Jenny.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.062
Okay.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.293
John, we've got a problem.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.198
Someone's killing your men.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.362
You gave them new identities.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.871
There must have been a leak.

10:40.973 --> 10:44.704
Lawson, Forrestal, Bennett,
they've all been hit.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.371
- Who is doing it?
- You've made enemies all over the world.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.881
It could have been the Syrians,
the South Americans...

10:50.983 --> 10:53.543
the Russians or a terrorist group.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.888
They're gonna find you.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.487
We were going
to make a normal life here.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.563
You will. I promise.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.064
I'm going into the city to coordinate
with the Federal people.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.566
We'll nail those bastards
before they get close to you.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.901
In the meantime, Jackson and Harris
will stay here with you.

11:14.006 --> 11:18.067
- Are they any good?
- Real good, but not as good as you were.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.402
Is it bad?

11:47.039 --> 11:50.304
I'm not leaving you,
if that's what you mean.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.207
Then it can't be bad.

12:19.939 --> 12:22.908
- How bad are you hit?
- I can make it. I'll be all right.

12:23.008 --> 12:26.944
I've got to get my rifle from the shed.
Keep an eye out. They'll be coming.

12:27.046 --> 12:30.641
Remember, you're downwind.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.741
The air current may tip them off.

12:32.852 --> 12:36.515
- Downwind? You think
I can smell them coming?
- I did.

12:38.524 --> 12:43.587
Okay, Jenny, you go to your bedroom, okay?
And stay out of sight. I'll be right back.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.845
Where is she?

13:33.946 --> 13:36.312
Mellow out, man.

13:36.415 --> 13:40.875
<i>We can't talk business with you
waving guns in people's faces.</i>

13:40.986 --> 13:45.320
Your daughter's safe, Colonel.
Whether she stays that way is up to you.

13:45.424 --> 13:47.517
My people got some business with you.

13:47.626 --> 13:49.594
<i>If you want your kid back...</i>

13:49.695 --> 13:52.220
<i>then you gotta cooperate.</i>

13:52.331 --> 13:54.891
- Right?
- Wrong.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.668
He's coming at us with no brakes.

15:29.228 --> 15:32.823
<i>He's still coming, the crazy bastard.
He's gonna hit us.</i>

15:36.936 --> 15:39.302
Shit!

16:05.831 --> 16:07.822
Don't move, motherfucker.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.007
- Bennett, I thought you wereâ€”
- Dead?

16:18.477 --> 16:20.638
You thought wrong.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.340
Ever since you had me
thrown out of your unit...

16:23.449 --> 16:26.316
I've waited to pay you back.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.353
Do you know what today is, Matrix?

16:31.256 --> 16:33.315
Payday.

16:54.446 --> 16:57.074
Tranquilizers.

16:57.182 --> 17:01.050
- I wanted to use the real thing!
- Where's Jenny?

17:01.153 --> 17:04.520
<i>Do you remember me, Colonel?</i>

17:04.623 --> 17:07.786
I remember you, scumbag.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.794
<i>Especially the people
you've tortured and killed.</i>

17:10.896 --> 17:13.592
<i>Colonel Matrix.</i>

17:13.699 --> 17:19.398
You do not understand
a country like Val Verde.

17:19.505 --> 17:22.098
<i>- It is a country that needs...</i>

17:22.207 --> 17:26.906
a president who has
an understanding of discipline.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.310
<i>- Why tell me?
- Because...</i>

17:29.415 --> 17:32.873
you're going to return
to Val Verde...

17:32.985 --> 17:35.886
and you are going to kill
the president...

17:35.988 --> 17:38.548
that you helped to overthrow me.

17:38.657 --> 17:40.648
Why don't you have Bennett do it?

17:40.759 --> 17:43.091
<i>Sounds like something
he would get off on.</i>

17:43.195 --> 17:46.892
Because President Velazquez
trusts you, Colonel.

17:46.999 --> 17:50.093
<i>After all, he made you
the hero of the revolution.</i>

17:50.202 --> 17:54.161
Captain Bennett left, shall we say,
under a cloud. Yes?

17:54.273 --> 17:57.106
Yeah. He enjoyed killing
a little too much.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.609
Your training, Matrix.

17:59.711 --> 18:03.112
You can get close
to President Velazquez.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.581
You will kill him.

18:05.684 --> 18:08.118
<i>You know, we went to
a lot of trouble to find you.</i>

18:08.220 --> 18:10.381
<i>We had to pretend
Captain Bennett's death...</i>

18:10.489 --> 18:13.947
so that General Kirby would become
agitated and lead us to you...

18:14.059 --> 18:18.257
<i>and now that I have you,
you will do exactly...</i>

18:18.363 --> 18:20.661
<i>as I tell you.</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:23.428
Fuck you.

18:34.713 --> 18:37.045
- Daddy.
- Jenny.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.644
<i>Oh, you bastards.</i>

18:43.755 --> 18:48.988
<i>Colonel Matrix, if you kill President Velazquez,
I will send her back to you.</i>

18:49.094 --> 18:52.621
<i>If you try anything else...</i>

18:52.731 --> 18:55.029
I will mail her to you in pieces.

19:05.244 --> 19:08.145
- Any sign of Matrix?
- No, sir. Just those bodies.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.147
You think there's more, sir?

19:10.249 --> 19:13.650
If he's still alive,
I'd expect a lot more.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.198
Sully will make sure
you get on the plane.

19:32.771 --> 19:36.434
Henriques will stay with you,
make sure you get off.

19:36.542 --> 19:40.103
I don't hear from either one of'em,
she's dead.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.271
How much are they paying you, Bennett?

19:42.381 --> 19:46.579
They offered me a hundred grand.
You want to know something?

19:46.685 --> 19:50.121
<i>When I found out I'd get my hands on you,
I said I'd do it for nothing.</i>

19:51.456 --> 19:55.119
- Hey! Hold it.
- I'll be back, Bennett.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.924
<i>John!</i>

20:01.033 --> 20:03.194
I'll be ready, John.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.307
We're running late, buddy.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.319
So you and Bennett
met in the service?

20:22.421 --> 20:24.719
Me and Henriques
was in the service too.

20:24.823 --> 20:27.621
There's nothing
like old war buddies.

20:27.726 --> 20:31.059
Well, have a nice trip now.

20:31.163 --> 20:34.792
Take care. Oh, here.
Have some beers in Val Verde, Matrix.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.427
It'll give everyone a little
more time with your daughter.

20:38.537 --> 20:42.234
You're a funny guy, Sully. I like you.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.241
That's why I'm going to kill you last.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.708
Move.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.074
<i>Hasta luego, fellas.</i>

21:09.468 --> 21:11.436
First class, 7-A.

21:13.705 --> 21:16.299
And you're 7-B, sir.

21:26.551 --> 21:29.520
- Any carry-on luggage?
- Just him.

21:33.225 --> 21:36.160
Open your mouth again,
and I'll nail it shut.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.621
- You must fasten your seat belt, sir.
- Thank you.

21:40.732 --> 21:44.224
- Could I have a blanket and a pillow, please?
- Sure.

21:51.943 --> 21:54.434
- There you go.
- Thank you.

21:56.181 --> 21:58.672
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now preparing for departure.</i>

21:58.784 --> 22:01.378
If you'll please make sure
all your carry-on luggage...

22:01.486 --> 22:03.647
<i>is safely stored
in the overhead compartments.</i>

22:03.755 --> 22:06.883
<i>Make sure your seat belts are fastened
and extinguish all cigarettes.</i>

22:06.992 --> 22:11.088
Once we reach our cruising altitude,
we're gonna be serving our beverages...

22:11.196 --> 22:13.164
<i>and then, a little later on,
our dinner.</i>

22:13.265 --> 22:15.495
<i>Shortly after that,
we'll be showing our feature film.</i>

22:15.600 --> 22:18.160
<i>Your flight attendants
are Susan and Lance...</i>

22:18.270 --> 22:20.170
<i>- and I'm Vicky.</i>

22:20.272 --> 22:22.740
<i>We're here to make your trip
as comfortable as possible.</i>

22:22.841 --> 22:24.809
<i>Thank you, and have a safe
and enjoyable flight.</i>

22:37.622 --> 22:40.022
Excuse me.
How long is the flight?

22:40.124 --> 22:42.752
We land in Val Verde
in exactly 11 hours.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.920
<i>Thank you, and do me a favor.</i>

22:45.029 --> 22:47.361
Don't disturb my friend.
He's dead tired.

22:53.204 --> 22:55.695
Front, please.
Thank you.

22:55.807 --> 22:58.901
Sir, during takeoff
you must remain seated.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.978
I'm airsick.

25:54.485 --> 25:56.180
Yeah, the bird has flown.
Cargo's aboard.

25:56.215 --> 25:57.876
Yeah, the bird has flown.
Cargo's aboard.

25:58.050 --> 26:00.382
Now go to the drop-off point.

26:00.486 --> 26:03.922
<i>Yes. Gracias, Sully.</i>

26:06.726 --> 26:08.887
Well, we are right on schedule.

26:08.994 --> 26:14.660
<i>With any good fortune,
today will be my last day as a civilian.</i>

26:18.104 --> 26:20.072
Your father seems to be cooperating.

26:20.172 --> 26:25.610
<i>You will be together with him soon.
Won't that be nice?</i>

26:25.711 --> 26:29.477
Not nearly as nice
as watching him kick your ass.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.787
Take her below.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.962
<i>Yeah, that Cindy.</i>

27:06.067 --> 27:08.558
<i>Well, my 7:40 flight
to Vancouver was canceled.</i>

27:08.669 --> 27:12.605
So how about dinner? Yeah.

27:13.741 --> 27:16.209
<i>Well, I could go to bed early too.</i>

27:24.018 --> 27:27.044
- Maybe we should do it another time.
- Sounds like he's mad at you.

27:30.625 --> 27:33.492
Okay. Well, I like you too.

27:33.594 --> 27:36.586
All right then.
Talk to you soon. Bye.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.892
<i>Well, love and careersâ€”
It's tough, ain't it?</i>

27:39.000 --> 27:41.798
- Sounds like you need a date.
- Well, I don't.

27:41.903 --> 27:44.599
I bet girls like you meet
a lot of nice boys at airports.

27:44.705 --> 27:47.469
Listen, you're really bugging me.

28:36.157 --> 28:38.182
Hey!

28:38.292 --> 28:40.260
Hey! Slow down.

28:46.601 --> 28:49.297
You know, I got something
I'd really like to give you.

28:49.403 --> 28:52.304
- I'm not interested.
- Oh! You don't know what you're missing.

28:52.406 --> 28:54.806
From here it looks like a nightmare.
Would you leave me alone?

28:55.910 --> 28:59.243
You fucking whore.

29:12.477 --> 29:14.308
Don't move!

29:14.412 --> 29:17.643
- I'm not going to hurt you. Step aside.
- You said, "Don't move."

29:17.749 --> 29:20.183
Do it. Get in the car.

29:36.501 --> 29:40.335
- Do exactly what I tell you to do.
- I've got a 7:30 karate class.

29:40.438 --> 29:42.338
<i>- I can't help you.
- You're not gonna make it.</i>

29:49.580 --> 29:52.606
Follow him.

29:52.717 --> 29:56.551
Oh, I knew you were gonna say that.

30:18.943 --> 30:23.073
Don't get offended by this question,
but are you gonna kill me or something?

30:23.181 --> 30:26.150
- No.
- I suppose you wouldn't tell me if you were.

30:26.250 --> 30:29.242
- Sure I would.
- Really?

30:30.455 --> 30:33.424
Trust me.

30:36.094 --> 30:40.030
Stay close to him. Faster.

30:40.131 --> 30:43.259
<i>That's good.</i>

30:43.368 --> 30:45.734
- Can you tell me what this is about?
- Yeah.

30:45.837 --> 30:48.738
- A guy I trusted for years wants me dead.
- That's understandable.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.274
I've only known you five minutes,
and I want you dead too.

31:54.554 --> 31:57.682
Out. Come. Hurry up.

32:01.627 --> 32:05.461
- Listen, if you're in a hurry, I can justâ€”
- I'm almost through with you.

32:30.323 --> 32:34.157
Listen to me. My daughter
has been kidnapped.

32:34.260 --> 32:36.455
He's the only chance
I've got of finding her.

32:36.562 --> 32:39.759
If he sees me or I lose him,
he'll kill her.

32:39.866 --> 32:43.632
What I need you to do is follow him,
tell him you're crazy about him.

32:43.736 --> 32:46.068
Try to bring him over here.
I will do the rest...

32:46.172 --> 32:48.663
and you can go back
to your normal life, got it?

32:48.774 --> 32:53.575
- No.
- Please, help me. You're the only chance I've got.

32:53.679 --> 32:55.738
She has less than 10 hours left.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.941
Don't you understand?
They're gonna kill her.

32:58.050 --> 33:01.110
Okay. All right.
I'll help you.

33:44.263 --> 33:47.824
Listen, there's this huge guy outside
in a green T-shirt.

33:47.934 --> 33:50.334
<i>And he's a paranoid maniac
and he's kidnapped me...</i>

33:50.436 --> 33:52.836
and I need your help.

33:52.939 --> 33:55.305
- I'll check it out.
- Thank you.

33:56.842 --> 34:00.369
- I hear you're a great man with transmissions.
- That's right.

34:19.966 --> 34:23.833
Oh, yeah.
These will work just fine.

34:25.571 --> 34:29.029
Biggs, are you there? Listen.
There's a guy that may be a wacko.

34:29.141 --> 34:31.199
I don't think
I can handle him alone.

34:31.310 --> 34:34.746
I'll be right there. Wanna see me kick some ass?

34:39.217 --> 34:41.413
- You'd better wait here, miss.
- Thank you.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.715
Attention, all units.

34:43.822 --> 34:46.121
Emergency on the theater level.

34:46.225 --> 34:48.386
<i>Suspect: Six feet two, brown hair.</i>

34:48.494 --> 34:51.554
He's one gigantic motherfucker.

34:51.664 --> 34:54.224
This used to be a great place
for hunting slash.

34:54.333 --> 34:57.359
It's got a little crowded now.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.734
I think I found something though.

35:01.841 --> 35:04.173
I'll see you.

35:28.167 --> 35:31.432
What are you doing in here?

35:31.537 --> 35:33.630
I'm waiting for my friend.

35:34.907 --> 35:37.603
- Are you looking for me?
- You better come with us.

35:45.384 --> 35:49.844
What? Matrix.

35:49.955 --> 35:52.446
Give me a quarter.
Give me a quarter!

35:57.096 --> 35:59.792
Move it!

36:14.547 --> 36:19.314
<i>- Oh, shit!
- Son of a bitch!</i>

36:24.724 --> 36:27.124
- Out of my way.
- Freeze!

36:44.276 --> 36:46.676
- Come on! Let's go get him!
- Come on.

36:49.315 --> 36:51.909
- Stop or I'll shoot!
- No!

37:05.698 --> 37:08.360
<i>Hey, Lady! Stop!</i>

38:09.195 --> 38:12.790
Wait! Wait for me!
Don't you go anywhere!

38:12.898 --> 38:15.992
Who the hell are you, huh?

38:16.101 --> 38:19.264
<i>You steal my car.
You rip the seat out. You kidnap me.</i>

38:19.371 --> 38:22.898
You ask me to help you find your daughter,
which I very kindly do...

38:23.008 --> 38:26.774
<i>and then you get me involved
in a shootout where people are dying.</i>

38:26.879 --> 38:28.744
I watch you rip a phone booth
outta the wall...

38:28.848 --> 38:32.614
swing from the ceiling like Tarzan
and then a cop is gonna shoot you...

38:32.718 --> 38:35.778
and I save you,
and he starts chasing me!

38:35.888 --> 38:38.516
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on or what?

38:38.624 --> 38:44.256
- No.
- No? No? Oh, my God! Watch out!

39:11.223 --> 39:13.123
What are you doing?

39:16.161 --> 39:19.358
Oh! Look out!

39:20.733 --> 39:22.667
This is not my day!

39:29.008 --> 39:30.976
Whoa!

39:56.769 --> 39:59.237
My car!

40:23.729 --> 40:26.129
- Are you all right?
- I think I'm dead.

40:26.231 --> 40:29.291
- You're all right. Wait for me.
- Okay.

40:43.582 --> 40:45.641
- Where is she, Sully?
- Kiss my ass.

40:45.751 --> 40:49.653
- I can't hear you.
- I'll say it louder then. Get fucked.

40:49.755 --> 40:51.985
Your loyalty is very touching...

40:52.091 --> 40:55.754
but it is not the most important thing
in your life right now.

40:55.861 --> 40:58.830
What is important is gravity.

41:00.032 --> 41:01.966
<i>I have to remind you, Sully...</i>

41:02.067 --> 41:04.092
<i>this is my weak arm.</i>

41:04.203 --> 41:07.764
You can't kill me.
You need me to find your daughter.

41:07.873 --> 41:10.603
- Where is she?
- I don't know, but Cooke knows.

41:10.709 --> 41:13.439
- I'll take you where
I'm supposed to meet him.
- But you won't.

41:13.545 --> 41:17.675
<i>- Why not?
- Because I already know.</i>

41:17.783 --> 41:21.014
Remember when I promised to kill you last?

41:21.120 --> 41:24.351
- That's right. You did.
- I lied.

41:29.461 --> 41:31.861
So now you don't have a car.

41:45.711 --> 41:48.111
Now I do.

41:53.986 --> 41:57.353
- What did you do with Sully?
- I let him go.

42:34.242 --> 42:36.301
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

42:36.411 --> 42:38.641
Why don't you tell me
what this is all about?

42:39.747 --> 42:43.012
- It's about her.
- Is this your daughter?

42:43.117 --> 42:46.609
<i>Some people are using her
to force me to do a job.</i>

42:46.721 --> 42:50.851
- If I don't get to her soon, they'll kill her.
- Did you do the job?

42:50.959 --> 42:53.621
<i>No. I knew they would
kill her even if I did it.</i>

42:53.728 --> 42:57.323
Her only chance now is that I get to her
before they find out what I'm doing.

43:10.367 --> 43:12.995
Let's go. Out.

43:25.899 --> 43:27.867
Stay put.

44:21.989 --> 44:25.186
- What are you doing?
- Helping you get her back.

45:02.062 --> 45:04.223
- Look through the drawers.
- All right.

45:33.827 --> 45:36.887
It's Cooke.
Mess up the bed.

45:36.997 --> 45:39.693
<i>Okay.</i>

45:45.105 --> 45:47.232
Remember, you had a good time with Sully.

45:47.340 --> 45:49.399
Open the door.

45:50.877 --> 45:52.845
All right.

45:58.385 --> 46:01.013
Yeah?

46:01.121 --> 46:03.180
- Where's Sully?
- In the shower.

46:04.725 --> 46:08.161
- Who are you?
- Room service.

46:08.261 --> 46:10.593
Open the door.

46:10.697 --> 46:12.858
Move back over there.

46:15.135 --> 46:17.467
Hey, Sully!

46:42.496 --> 46:45.488
You scared, motherfucker?
You should be.

46:45.599 --> 46:48.397
This Green Beret's
gonna kick your big ass.

46:48.502 --> 46:50.800
I eat Green Berets for breakfast.

46:50.904 --> 46:53.372
And right now I'm really hungry.

46:53.473 --> 46:55.464
I can't believe this macho bullshit.

47:13.126 --> 47:15.993
Fuck you, asshole.

47:16.096 --> 47:18.656
<i>Fuck you, asshole.</i>

47:21.668 --> 47:24.193
These guys eat too much red meat.

47:43.023 --> 47:45.457
<i>Where is she?</i>

47:48.829 --> 47:50.854
Cooke!

48:05.579 --> 48:07.547
Let's go.

48:13.086 --> 48:15.554
<i>This must be Cooke's car.</i>

48:17.424 --> 48:19.824
Let's search it.

48:35.909 --> 48:37.877
I think I found something.

48:41.147 --> 48:44.913
- Look at this.
- What is this?

48:45.018 --> 48:48.749
- Coastal is a fuel depot that supplies planes.
- To whom? The airlines?

48:48.855 --> 48:52.018
- Usually smaller, private aircraft.
- Are you sure?

48:52.125 --> 48:54.685
I'm getting my pilot's license.
This is where my instructor gets his fuel.

48:54.794 --> 48:57.729
There are a lot of warehouses
down the street.

48:57.831 --> 48:59.799
Arius must be keeping
a plane down there.

48:59.900 --> 49:04.394
Let's go. We'll take Cooke's car.
He won't be needing it.

49:21.354 --> 49:24.084
This is it.
Patria Enterprises.

49:27.861 --> 49:30.091
I think this is where
I was this afternoon.

49:46.046 --> 49:48.947
- You go this way and wait for my signal.
- Okay.

51:40.827 --> 51:42.886
<i>- Cindy. Come on.
- Yeah?</i>

51:50.336 --> 51:53.567
I've seen all the equipment they've got,
but there's no airplane.

51:53.673 --> 51:56.073
- What about your daughter?
- Arius and Bennett aren't here.

51:56.176 --> 51:58.406
- She's wherever they are.
- Okay.

51:58.511 --> 52:00.479
Look at this.

52:09.456 --> 52:13.222
<i>These coordinates are
somewhere near Santa Barbara.</i>

52:19.848 --> 52:21.816
Longitude.

52:25.387 --> 52:29.084
There's something going on at this island
off the coast north of here.

52:29.191 --> 52:32.422
- This must be where they've taken Jenny.
- Look.

52:32.527 --> 52:34.791
Here's a photo
of an amphibian airplane.

52:34.897 --> 52:37.127
Maybe they use it to fly out there.

52:37.232 --> 52:39.723
Yeah, let's look at that invoice.

52:49.244 --> 52:53.271
All right.
Type four fuel is amphibian.

52:53.382 --> 52:55.282
250 gallons is what it would take...

52:55.384 --> 52:57.944
to fly this plane
to the island and back.

52:58.053 --> 53:01.784
But it isn't here.
I've seen everything they've got.

53:01.890 --> 53:04.950
It was refueled at Pump Station 32,
Pacific Pier.

53:05.060 --> 53:07.119
That's San Pedro.

53:08.430 --> 53:11.593
- How long does it take to fly?
- About two hours.

53:21.243 --> 53:23.973
- Are we going to the plane?
- Not yet.

53:26.081 --> 53:29.312
- Where are we going?
- Shopping.

53:31.486 --> 53:33.886
Shopping?

54:56.671 --> 54:58.798
Come on. Come on.

55:22.864 --> 55:26.322
- What's that?
- Rocket launcher. Go!

55:46.388 --> 55:50.256
<i>Freeze!
Don't even think about it!</i>

55:50.358 --> 55:53.452
<i>TX-94. TX-94.</i>

55:54.729 --> 55:57.129
- Stick him in the truck.
- Come on. Come on.

56:22.891 --> 56:27.487
<i>If you call General Franklin Kirby
he will explain everything to you.</i>

56:27.596 --> 56:32.295
Kirby, huh? Yeah, I think we ran him in last week.

56:50.485 --> 56:55.889
<i>- Hey! Hooker.
- Not bad.</i>

57:04.199 --> 57:06.997
<i>What do you think she's doing?</i>

57:07.102 --> 57:10.333
- I think she's got something for us.
- I bet she does.

57:19.047 --> 57:22.778
- Shit!
- What the hell was that?
- God!

57:25.153 --> 57:27.087
- Jesus Christ!
- Whoa!

57:51.513 --> 57:55.506
- Where did you learn how to do that?
- I read the instructions.

58:00.555 --> 58:04.685
<i>What time you expect Matrix
to arrive in Val Verde?</i>

58:04.793 --> 58:06.761
Just over two hours.

58:06.861 --> 58:10.729
Do you think he's going to
give us any problems?

58:10.832 --> 58:13.767
He'll do exactly as he's told...

58:13.868 --> 58:17.463
as long as he thinks
he'll get his daughter back.

59:19.334 --> 59:21.825
- It's all clear.
- Good.

59:31.079 --> 59:33.513
<i>Did anybody ever tell you
you have a lot ofhostility?</i>

59:33.615 --> 59:35.742
Come on. Let's move.

59:38.553 --> 59:40.544
I hope I can fly this plane.

59:55.603 --> 59:58.595
Oh, shit.

01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:02.166
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

01:00:02.277 --> 01:00:04.905
This isn't a plane.
This is a canoe with wings!

01:00:05.013 --> 01:00:07.208
Well, then get in and start paddling.

01:00:13.221 --> 01:00:16.588
<i>Start the engine. Hurry up!</i>

01:00:16.691 --> 01:00:20.058
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:24.624
<i>- Oh, my God! This plane is older than I am!
- Come on!</i>

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.027
Look! There's no L.E.D. Readout!

01:00:29.304 --> 01:00:31.295
I've only trained on a Cessna!

01:00:31.406 --> 01:00:34.204
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying!

01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:38.811
Shit!

01:00:38.913 --> 01:00:42.440
Come on, you piece of shit! Fly or die!

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:45.619
Works every time.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.840
All right, here we go.

01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:12.612
- Watch out for the boat!
- Oh! We're not gonna make it!

01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:14.648
Yes, we are.

01:01:24.092 --> 01:01:28.927
We did it.
We did it. Wow.

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:31.521
- Well done.
- Thank you.

01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:38.471
- Matrix?
- Call the Federal building.

01:01:38.573 --> 01:01:41.701
Have them monitor every police,
aviation and marine channel.

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:44.142
- What are you expecting?
- World War III.

01:01:46.948 --> 01:01:52.284
Repeat. This is Whiskey Xray 448
for General Kirby. Urgent you respond.

01:01:52.387 --> 01:01:57.791
<i> Attention unidentified aircraft.
This is the Coast Guard cutter Marauder.</i>

01:01:57.892 --> 01:01:59.792
You're flying over
the San Miguel Gunnery Range.

01:01:59.894 --> 01:02:01.885
This is a highly restricted area.

01:02:01.996 --> 01:02:04.487
<i>You must change course,
or you will be forced to land.</i>

01:02:04.599 --> 01:02:07.466
- Acknowledge.
- Urgent. Repeat. Urgent.

01:02:07.569 --> 01:02:10.834
<i>You must contact
General Franklin Kirby.</i>

01:02:10.939 --> 01:02:14.136
You must first change course
or you risk being shot down. Acknowledge.

01:02:14.242 --> 01:02:18.542
They shoot the shit out of this area all the time.

01:02:18.646 --> 01:02:21.308
All the flights out of LAX
avoid it like the plague.

01:02:21.416 --> 01:02:24.283
- Can you go below radar?
- Not marine radar.

01:02:24.385 --> 01:02:27.616
Maybe if I get us close enough to the water,
the waves can camouflage us.

01:02:27.722 --> 01:02:30.657
- Go down.
- Oh. Okay.

01:02:30.758 --> 01:02:32.919
- Do it.
- Hang on.

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:48.733
We lost them, sir.

01:03:24.045 --> 01:03:25.774
Slitting a little girl's throat...

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.280
is like cutting warm butter.

01:03:29.617 --> 01:03:31.881
Put the knife away...

01:03:31.986 --> 01:03:33.977
and shut your mouth.

01:03:41.462 --> 01:03:45.193
I love listening to your little pissant soldiers
trying to talk tough.

01:03:46.234 --> 01:03:48.202
They make me laugh.

01:03:48.303 --> 01:03:51.136
If Matrix was here, he'd laugh too.

01:03:51.239 --> 01:03:54.731
Mr. Bennett, my soldiers are patriots.

01:03:54.842 --> 01:03:56.776
Your soldiers are nothing.

01:03:56.878 --> 01:04:00.405
Matrix and I could kill every one of them
in the blink of an eye.

01:04:00.515 --> 01:04:06.181
- Remember that.
- Are you trying to frighten me?

01:04:06.287 --> 01:04:08.551
I don't have to try.

01:04:08.656 --> 01:04:13.457
When Matrix finishes the job,
he'll be back for his daughter.

01:04:13.561 --> 01:04:19.500
Whether she's alive or dead doesn't matter.
Then he'll be after you.

01:04:19.601 --> 01:04:22.934
The only thing between
Matrix and you...

01:04:23.972 --> 01:04:25.963
is me.

01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:31.205
It is you that is afraid, Mr. Bennett.

01:04:32.513 --> 01:04:35.505
You are afraid of Matrix.

01:04:35.617 --> 01:04:39.883
Of course. I'm smart.

01:04:39.988 --> 01:04:42.548
But I have an edge.

01:04:42.657 --> 01:04:45.353
I have his daughter.

01:04:48.997 --> 01:04:51.932
- Is that it?
- That's the one.

01:04:56.037 --> 01:05:00.303
Land here. It's the most
isolated spot we'll find.

01:05:00.408 --> 01:05:03.707
Okay, here we go.

01:05:49.657 --> 01:05:51.750
Now, you remember the message?

01:05:51.859 --> 01:05:56.728
Commando, Kirby, Code Red,
Coordinates. Got it.

01:05:56.831 --> 01:05:59.925
Don't break radio silence
until they see me.

01:06:00.034 --> 01:06:04.198
- How will I know?
- Because all fucking hell is gonna break loose.

01:06:04.305 --> 01:06:07.604
Be careful, Matrix.
Good luck.

01:06:07.709 --> 01:06:10.644
Thanks.

01:10:13.955 --> 01:10:15.980
He was not on the plane.

01:10:18.726 --> 01:10:21.923
Kill her.

01:11:20.855 --> 01:11:24.552
Welcome back, John.
So glad you could make it.

01:11:42.043 --> 01:11:44.068
That little...

01:11:44.178 --> 01:11:46.510
bitch!

01:12:40.434 --> 01:12:43.870
<i>Commando.
I say again, Commando.</i>

01:12:43.971 --> 01:12:46.371
This is Whiskey Xray 448.

01:12:46.474 --> 01:12:50.103
I have an emergency priority message
for a General Franklin Kirby.

01:12:50.211 --> 01:12:52.611
I repeat, General Franklin Kirby.

01:12:52.713 --> 01:12:57.741
General, you'd better get out here.
We have your message on the Teletype.

01:17:48.248 --> 01:17:50.648
<i>Jenny!</i>

01:17:55.121 --> 01:17:57.419
<i>Jenny?</i>

01:17:57.524 --> 01:17:59.651
Jenny!

01:19:13.233 --> 01:19:15.565
<i>Daddy?</i>

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:52.038
Jenny!

01:19:55.241 --> 01:19:57.573
Daddy?

01:19:59.145 --> 01:20:01.113
Daddy?

01:20:02.549 --> 01:20:06.349
- Jenny!
- Daddy?

01:20:06.453 --> 01:20:10.048
No. Not Daddy.

01:20:10.156 --> 01:20:12.215
Come on!

01:20:18.732 --> 01:20:21.667
Daddy.

01:20:24.170 --> 01:20:28.937
- John! How's your arm?
- Come over and find out.

01:20:29.042 --> 01:20:31.772
No, thanks.
I think I'll take a pass.

01:20:33.113 --> 01:20:35.308
<i>John, stick your head out.</i>

01:20:35.415 --> 01:20:37.940
One shot, right between the eyes.

01:20:38.051 --> 01:20:40.986
I'll make it quick,
just for old times' sake.

01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:44.488
Bennett, stop screwing around
and let the girl go.

01:20:44.591 --> 01:20:47.617
It's me that you want. I have only one arm.

01:20:47.727 --> 01:20:49.695
<i>You can beat me.</i>

01:20:49.796 --> 01:20:52.526
Come on, Bennett.

01:20:52.632 --> 01:20:55.032
Throw away that chickenshit gun.

01:20:57.537 --> 01:21:01.997
<i>You don't just want to pull a trigger.
Put the knife in me...</i>

01:21:02.108 --> 01:21:05.737
and look me in the eye
and see what's going on in there...

01:21:05.845 --> 01:21:07.813
when you turn it.

01:21:07.914 --> 01:21:10.474
- That's what you want to do, right?
- I can kill you, John.

01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:12.483
<i>Come on.
Let the girl go.</i>

01:21:12.585 --> 01:21:16.988
<i>It's between you and me.
Don't deprive yourself of some pleasure.</i>

01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:20.116
Come on, Bennett.
Let's party.

01:21:20.226 --> 01:21:22.490
- I can beat you.
- No.

01:21:22.595 --> 01:21:24.563
I don't need the girl.

01:21:24.664 --> 01:21:26.632
I don't need the girl!

01:21:26.733 --> 01:21:30.169
<i>I don't need the gun, John.</i>

01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:32.670
<i>I can beat you.</i>

01:21:32.772 --> 01:21:34.740
I don't need no gun!

01:21:37.277 --> 01:21:39.939
I'm gonna kill you now!

01:21:58.531 --> 01:22:01.557
- Daddy.
- You're getting old, John.

01:22:03.203 --> 01:22:06.502
You're getting old.

01:23:42.936 --> 01:23:46.064
John, I feel good,
just like old times.

01:23:47.273 --> 01:23:50.504
<i>What's it feel like to be a dying man?</i>

01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:53.044
- You're a dead man!
- Bullshit!

01:24:01.654 --> 01:24:04.885
<i>John, I'm not gonna
shoot you between the eyes.</i>

01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:07.653
<i>I'll shoot you between the balls!</i>

01:24:22.108 --> 01:24:24.770
Let off some steam, Bennett.

01:24:28.781 --> 01:24:30.749
Daddy.

01:25:11.291 --> 01:25:13.316
Move out!

01:25:48.328 --> 01:25:51.889
- Leave anything for us?
- Just bodies.

01:25:51.998 --> 01:25:55.058
I'd just like you to start up
your unit again, John.

01:25:55.168 --> 01:25:59.070
<i>- All it would take is your coming back.
- This was the last time.</i>

01:26:09.515 --> 01:26:12.143
Until the next time.

01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:26.530
No chance.
