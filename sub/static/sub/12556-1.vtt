OH, NO.

18:33.571 --> 18:37.064
FELLAS? NO.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.741
NOW, LOOK,
FELLAS. PLEASE.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.738
KLINE.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.661
BLAKE?

18:43.748 --> 18:45.364
KRANSKY?

18:51.339 --> 18:53.330
PHANTOMS.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.290
EVERYTHING'S A PHANTOM.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.632
THERE ISN'T A THING,

19:02.516 --> 19:05.929
NOT A SINGLE
THING THAT'S REAL.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.356
OH, GOD.

19:08.439 --> 19:12.433
OH, GOD, WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.485
WON'T YOU LET
ME IN ON IT?

19:19.283 --> 19:22.366

19:40.554 --> 19:43.342
<i>(man) JAMES EMBRY,
AGE 41, SINGLE.</i>

19:43.432 --> 19:46.675
<i>IT HAPPENED THIS MORNING. WENT BYA
NEWSSTAND, LOOKED AT A PAPER,</i>

19:46.769 --> 19:50.637
THEN VVENT INTO SHOCK. VVHEN THE AMBULANCE
GOT THERE, HE VVAS ALMOST CATATONIC.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.813
IS THIS WHAT SET IT
OFF? THIS FRONT PAGE?

19:52.900 --> 19:56.814
THAT'S VVHY I THOUGHT VVE OUGHT
TO HA\/E A PSYCHIATRIST IN ON IT.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.735
IT'S VERY ODD.

20:00.825 --> 20:05.160
<i>I THOUGHT SO, TOO, SO I CHECKED WITH THE
PENTAGON IN WASHINGTON ON HIS ARMY BACKGROUND.</i>

20:05.246 --> 20:08.329
<i>CAPTAIN AIR FORCE, FLEW B-25,
AFRICA AND ITALY. 37 MISSIONS.</i>

20:08.416 --> 20:11.078
<i>DISCHARGED AUGUST 1943,
RECURRENT FEVERS.</i>

20:11.168 --> 20:13.910
<i>SOME SUGGESTION OF
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTURBANCE,</i>

20:14.004 --> 20:17.167
BUT HE VVAS DISCHARGED BEFORE THEY
COULD FIND OUT MUCH ABOUT IT.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.874
AND THIS WAS
HIS PLANE.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.084
HIS PLANE AND HIS CREW.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.591
TOOK OFF FOR ITALY ON VVHAT VVAS
SUPPOSED TO BE A ROUTINE FLIGHT.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.889
EMBRY NEVER WENT
ON THAT LAST MISSION.

20:26.976 --> 20:30.765
<i>REPORTED IN ILL, AND SOMEONE
ELSE FLEW THE PLANE FOR HIM.</i>

20:30.855 --> 20:32.846
<i>NEVER GOT BACK.</i>

20:32.940 --> 20:37.309
AND FOR 17 YEARS, HE'S BEEN
CARRYING THAT AROUND IN HIS GUT.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.521
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT,
MR. EMBRY.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.737
YOU'RE IN A HOSPITAL.
WE'LL LOOK AFTER YOU.

20:44.827 --> 20:49.412
CRAZY DREAM.
CRAZY DREAM.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.660
I WENT BACK.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.039
I WENT BACK
TO THE DESERT.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.545
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
MR. EMBRY.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.965
<i>NO, NO, NO. SORRY, MR. EMBRY. YOU
WENT BACK TO THE DESERT. THEN WHAT?</i>

21:01.051 --> 21:03.918
I WENT BACK
TO MY PLANE.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.630
L-| WAS LOOKING
FOR THE FELLAS.

21:06.724 --> 21:10.388
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE
FOR THEM. I SAW BLAKE,

21:10.478 --> 21:15.473
BUT IT WA-IT WAS
A MIRAGE, AN ILLUSION.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.103
HE WASN'T THERE.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.105
NONE OF THEM
WERE THERE.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.779
IT VVAS AN ILLUSION, MR. EMBRY,
BUT YOU'RE OUT OF IT NOVV.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.981
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.567
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN ON THE PLANE.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.830
I SHOULD HA\/E GONE ON THAT MISSION.
I CHICKENED OUT!

21:31.916 --> 21:34.328
YOU DIDN'T
CHICKEN OUT.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.752
YOU HAD NO VVAY OF KNOVVING THAT
PLANE VVASN'T GOING TO COME BACK.

21:37.838 --> 21:41.672
NOVV YOU REALIZE IT MORE AS TIME GOES
BY, AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER FOR IT.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.966
IT'S OUT IN
THE OPEN NOW.

21:44.053 --> 21:48.012
YOU DON'T HA\/E TO HIDE
ITINAPIT DEEP INSIDE OF YOU.

21:48.098 --> 21:51.341
THAT'S VVHAT'S BEEN HURTING
YOU ALL THESE YEARS.

21:54.772 --> 22:00.108
<i>ANOTHER CRAZY THING. UH-UH, AN
ILLUSION OR A DREAM OR WHATEVER.</i>

22:01.654 --> 22:05.898
I-| WAS OUT THERE
IN THE DESERT AND--

22:07.243 --> 22:12.704
ABOVE ME IN
THE SKY, JETS.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.031
<i>JETS.</i>

22:19.880 --> 22:24.465
ISN'T THAT WILD? 1943.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.218
AFRICAN DESERT.

22:27.304 --> 22:30.513
AND JET PLANES OVERHEAD.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.135
JUST AS IF I--

22:32.226 --> 22:36.561
JUST AS IF I HAD
GONE BACK THERE TODAY.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.319
DID I?

22:45.406 --> 22:48.068
DID I GO BACK?

22:48.158 --> 22:50.490
DID I GO BACK
TO MY PLANE?

22:50.578 --> 22:55.414
IN YOUR MIND. THAT'S
HOVV YOU VVENT BACK.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.831
ONLY IN YOUR MIND.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.250
ONLY IN MY MIND.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.924
GO BACK TO SLEEP NOVV, MR. EMBRY.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.520
I THINK THE WORST
PART OF IT IS OVER.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.190
AT LEAST THE GUILT IS OUT IN THE
OPEN, AND HE KNOVVS VVHAT IT IS.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.191
THAT ILLUSION CERTAINLY
SEEMS REAL TO HIM.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.853
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, A VVEEK,
IT VVILL LOSE ALL REALITY.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.440
<i>DOCTOR, THESE ARE MR. EMBRY'S CLOTHES.
YOU LEFT THEM IN THE EXAMINATION ROOM.</i>

23:30.534 --> 23:33.196
PUT THEM ON THE DESK HERE. I'M GOING BACK.
I'LL TAKE THEM IN.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.028
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO HIM IN A DAY OR SO.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.616
<i>FINE. I'LL KEEP
A CHECK ON HIM.</i>

23:36.707 --> 23:38.448
<i>(nurse)
WHAT'S THAT?</i>

23:41.587 --> 23:43.954
IT'S SAND.

<i>ODD HOW THE REAL CONSORTS
WITH THE SHADOWS.</i>

23:56.560 --> 23:58.972

FUSES WITH THE PAST.</i>

IS ON FILE IN THE SILENT DESERT.</i>

24:03.400 --> 24:06.108
