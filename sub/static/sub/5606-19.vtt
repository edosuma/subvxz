WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:05.304
Mmm.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.772
(muffled):
I'm telling you, man.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.108
They have the best.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.443
They have the best pancakes
on the Island, hands down.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.612
These pancakes are the bomb.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.280
You know what it is?

00:15.282 --> 00:16.482
There ain't even a close second.

00:16.484 --> 00:17.516
It's a combination

00:17.518 --> 00:19.151
of maple and this haupia,

00:19.153 --> 00:20.486
this coconut syrup they have.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.487
That combo is crazy.
Mm-hmm.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.571
Yeah.

00:22.572 --> 00:23.654
You know what Danny does?
Hm?

00:23.657 --> 00:24.723
(tapping)

00:24.725 --> 00:26.425
(groans)
Boysenberry.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.659
Mm-mm.
It's disgusting, right?

00:27.661 --> 00:29.161
Mm-mm!
See? It's so wrong.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.530
Can't have no fruit
on top of pancakes.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.633
The only fruit I'm putting on
top of my pancakes is coconut.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.201
Well, coconut's not a fruit.
It's a drupe.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.237
It's a what?

00:38.239 --> 00:40.205
A drupe. It's any fruit
with an outer skin,

00:40.207 --> 00:41.740
pulpy middle and, uh, you know,
seed inside of it.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.042
I just remembered.
What's that?

00:43.044 --> 00:44.510
I don't care.
Oh.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.712
'Cause I'm eating pancakes;
I'm not writing a dissertation.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.680
Nice. You're welcome.
I love that.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.082
Mmm.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.216
Hey, speaking of

00:51.218 --> 00:52.518
old Detective Sunshine.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.519
Yeah?

00:53.521 --> 00:55.487
What'd he go to Vegas for?

00:55.489 --> 00:57.256
Well, Danny is actually, uh,

00:57.258 --> 00:59.058
chaperoning Grace's
cheerleading team

00:59.060 --> 01:00.225
to a competition.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.493
(laughter)

01:01.495 --> 01:03.595
You gonna make me choke
on my food.

01:03.597 --> 01:04.763
(laughing)
You mean to tell me

01:04.765 --> 01:07.266
Danny Williams is down in Vegas

01:07.268 --> 01:09.501
with a bunch
of 13-year-old Beliebers?

01:09.503 --> 01:10.769
Uh-huh.
Oh, man,

01:10.771 --> 01:12.671
I wish I could go down there
and see that.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.506
Well, you know what, I tried.
I checked Grace's Instagram,

01:14.508 --> 01:16.175
but she's got all her dad's
buddies blocked.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.260
So I couldn't see
any pictures.

01:18.261 --> 01:20.344
Well, what the hell you think
we got a crime lab for?

01:20.347 --> 01:22.147
You should get a techie
right on that.

01:22.149 --> 01:25.117
Otherwise, Williams is gonna
skate from this scot-free.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.518
You know what? I'm gonna
call Eric after breakfast.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.253
That's right.
The minute I walk out of here,

01:28.255 --> 01:29.188
That's right.
I'm gonna call the kid.

01:29.189 --> 01:30.122
That's a good idea.
Mmm.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.356
Oh!
Hm?

01:31.358 --> 01:32.424
One more thing.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.261
Not that it'll ever come up,

01:36.263 --> 01:39.331
but if my wife asks, you don't
tell her I had this stuff.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.567
You tell her

01:41.569 --> 01:43.335
that I had the diet plate.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.736
That's the turkey burger

01:44.738 --> 01:47.606
with no bun
and a scoop of cottage cheese.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.809
Why would your wife
ask me that question?

01:52.346 --> 01:54.513
Why the hell would the Red Sox
sell Babe Ruth for $5,000?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.398
I don't know!

01:56.399 --> 01:58.282
Don't ask me
to explain marriage to you.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.418
I just need to know
you got my back.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.619
Uh, yeah, of course.
Okay.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.454
Of course I got your back.
All right.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.523
Thank you,
thank you very much.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.293
I got you, man.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.229
What just happened?

02:10.231 --> 02:12.498
Did Steve McGarrett
just pick up a check?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.866
That's correct.

02:13.868 --> 02:16.201
What, you win the Powerball
or something?

02:16.203 --> 02:17.302
You feeling okay?

02:17.304 --> 02:18.537
Yeah.
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.638
You don't look too good.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.907
Oh, that's not necessary.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.208
You are forgetting
something, though.

02:23.210 --> 02:23.775
What?

02:23.777 --> 02:25.310
You owe me 20 bucks.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.578
For what?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.547
The Bulls-Clippers game,
last week.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.649
And frankly, Lou,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.217
I got to say
I'm a little disappointed

02:32.219 --> 02:33.318
that I have to ask for it.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.187
Huh?

02:35.189 --> 02:36.822
See, I'm sitting here thinking
you just my man,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.157
so you're gonna
buy me breakfast.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.858
That's all right.
No, that's okay.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.728
Hey, let me see that.
I am paying for breakfast.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.662
Thank you.
With my money.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.297
No, correction, correction.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.732
This was your money.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.767
I won it in a bet.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.836
Now it's my money.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.605
You are welcome.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.507
See how that works?
(groans)

02:55.509 --> 02:56.942
GROVER:
Yeah.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.712
STEVE:
Thanks, chef.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.347
(chuckles)

03:02.349 --> 03:03.782
(phone chimes)
Cheapskate.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.361
Good morning, Ona.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.763
Good morning, Commander.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.598
You look beautiful this morning.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.767
You've been saying the same line
to me for six years.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.769
And I meant it every time.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.404
(giggles)

03:25.406 --> 03:27.606
I thought you Navy boys
were all action.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.441
You just talk a good game.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.650
Excuse me, Ona.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.552
What about your change?

03:40.554 --> 03:41.620
(door bell jingles)

03:54.268 --> 03:57.603
<i> (Hawaii Five-O </i>
theme song plays)

04:26.767 --> 04:28.267
STEVE: It was weird, man.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.268
He went outside,
talked to this guy,

04:29.270 --> 04:30.669
then just disappeared.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.037
You try his cell phone?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.972
Yes, it's going
straight to voicemail.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.308
He's not responding
to texts, either.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.442
All right, what about Renee?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.311
Tried her, too. Twice.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.445
No answer.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.447
Yeah, I'm sure
everything is fine.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.816
Yeah, well, I'm not.
You didn't see what I saw, okay?

04:44.818 --> 04:46.518
That conversation
that Lou was having,

04:46.520 --> 04:47.786
it was pretty heated.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.054
All right, well,
what about the other guy?

04:49.056 --> 04:50.055
You recognize him?

04:50.057 --> 04:51.690
No, I never seen him before,

04:51.692 --> 04:53.992
but I could tell Lou
definitely knew him.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.295
(phone rings)
Hey, Chin, hold on a second.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.496
I got Kono.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.865
Go, Kono. You got me and Chin.
Go ahead.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.800
I just pinged Grover's cell.
Looks like he's at home.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.303
CHIN:
If he's at home,

05:04.305 --> 05:05.704
then why isn't he
picking up his phone?

05:05.706 --> 05:08.307
Chin, meet me there.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.075
(siren wailing)

05:39.606 --> 05:41.673
Lou?

05:46.747 --> 05:48.814
Renee?

05:48.816 --> 05:50.882
(TV playing indistinctly,
in distance)

05:53.520 --> 05:54.920
REPORTER: ...well back
in the dry sand.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.088
And the waves
will come up again.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.490
It's a dangerous situation.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.661
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
Welcome back to<i> Sunrise.</i>

06:02.663 --> 06:03.829
You know, so many people

06:03.831 --> 06:06.098
are talking
about those huge waves

06:06.100 --> 06:07.566
that are coming
in to the North Shore.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.700
Lou?

06:31.859 --> 06:33.825
CHIN:
Steve?

06:33.827 --> 06:36.862
Up here.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.671
Tell me the front door
wasn't open when you got here.

06:46.673 --> 06:47.839
(sighs)

06:47.841 --> 06:49.007
What do we got?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.177
Dust void.

06:55.015 --> 06:58.016
It's the shape of a suitcase.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.123
CHIN:
Found the same thing

07:05.125 --> 07:06.758
in Will's room.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.729
(sighs)

07:10.731 --> 07:12.063
This family strike you
as the type

07:12.065 --> 07:13.565
to have go-bags
under their beds?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.939
(microwave beeping)

07:25.078 --> 07:26.511
(sighs)

07:29.983 --> 07:30.916
Bring your phones!

07:30.918 --> 07:32.017
Come on, give me your phone.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.453
Let's go.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.155
They're going off the grid.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.458
But why?
What could've happened?

07:39.460 --> 07:41.493
I don't know, but I'm thinking
whatever that guy told Lou

07:41.495 --> 07:43.895
outside the coffee shop,
spooked him enough to run.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.565
And they were ready for it.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.569
Go straight to the truck.
Don't stop.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.246
KONO:
Anything?

08:01.247 --> 08:02.012
Still no word.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.298
Yeah, we checked
with the kids' schools.

08:03.299 --> 08:04.582
Both of them were no-shows
this morning.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.818
Okay, well,
the GPS in the family car

08:06.820 --> 08:08.887
has been disabled, so they're
definitely in the wind.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.089
What about the, uh, mystery man
outside the coffee shop?

08:11.091 --> 08:14.092
Nothing on the traffic cams, but
check out Lou's phone records.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.962
Okay, so the last entry
is an incoming text

08:16.964 --> 08:18.163
at 7:52 a.m.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.664
Okay, that's exactly

08:19.666 --> 08:20.832
when we left the Wailana.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.900
Just two words.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.702
"It's time." That's it.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.836
That make any sense to you?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.972
No. Who sent the text?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.173
It's registered to Frank Zagar.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.674
Philadelphia area code.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.009
Philly?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.978
Run it through NCIC,
see what we get.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.118
It says he's FBI.

08:41.588 --> 08:42.921
STEVE:
That's the guy.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.856
That's the guy that was
outside the Wailana.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.925
What would a Fed want
with Lou?

08:46.927 --> 08:48.560
Maybe he's in trouble.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.562
Well, if he is,
why wouldn't he call us?

08:54.568 --> 08:56.201
SAMANTHA:
<i> Where we gonna go?</i>

08:56.203 --> 08:57.702
We just have to get off
the Island.

08:57.704 --> 08:58.703
That's all.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.672
What if they find us?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.140
Nobody is gonna find us.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.975
We're just doing this
to be safe.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.044
Mom?
Sweetheart,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.145
you heard your father.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.047
This is just a precaution.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.016
Then why do we
have to leave the Island?

09:11.018 --> 09:13.018
Why can't we just move
to another town?

09:13.020 --> 09:15.153
Because if they find us,
they're gonna kill us.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.254
GROVER: Would you stop it? What?

09:16.256 --> 09:17.706
Will, that's not true.

09:17.707 --> 09:19.157
Your father would never let
anything happen to us.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.191
GROVER: That's right.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.192
Nobody's hurting

09:21.194 --> 09:23.061
anybody in this car, okay?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.329
I can promise you that.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.600
(sighs)

09:36.243 --> 09:38.243
All right, listen, family.
I know this is difficult.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.313
But we have to remember

09:41.315 --> 09:43.882
that we knew that
this day might come.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.918
The most important thing
right now

09:46.920 --> 09:49.120
is that we all stick together.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.658
And stop scaring your sister.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.196
What does the FBI want
with Lou Grover?

09:58.198 --> 09:59.931
SAC: Special Agent Zagar's
working on

09:59.933 --> 10:00.966
his relocation.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.000
What are you talking about,
relocation?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.134
He's relocating my guy?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.803
Why would he be doing that?

10:04.805 --> 10:07.372
Your guy was a high-value asset
in an important

10:07.374 --> 10:10.075
undercover case
that went down back in '89.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.077
Agent Zagar was his handler.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.379
So all this is blowback
for that op,

10:14.381 --> 10:15.914
and now Lou's on the run?

10:15.916 --> 10:17.816
We believe so.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.819
All right, I need to speak
with Agent Zagar.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.387
Commander,
you know the protocol.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.222
This is a dark extraction.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.957
Grover's been compromised.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.660
You're just gonna have to trust

10:28.662 --> 10:30.695

under control now.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.163
I'm sorry,

10:32.165 --> 10:33.932
but there's nothing more I can do.
Yeah, right.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.033
Thanks for taking our call.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.102
Does he really expect us

10:37.104 --> 10:38.937
to sit back and do nothing
while Lou and his family

10:38.939 --> 10:39.938
run for their lives?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.239
Well, if the FBI
can't help us,

10:41.241 --> 10:43.308
I know somebody who can.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.795

11:04.865 --> 11:06.297
How you doing, honey?
You all right?

11:07.401 --> 11:08.900
I will be.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.802

11:13.206 --> 11:14.823
Hey.

11:14.824 --> 11:16.441
I knew what I signed up
for when I married you.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.044
Renee, I know you did,
but the kids...

11:19.046 --> 11:20.779
the kids never had a choice.

11:20.781 --> 11:21.780
No, no, no, no.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.014
Mm-mm.

Lou, we're going to
make this transition

11:55.949 --> 11:57.182
as smooth as possible.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.783
We're gonna do everything
we possibly can

11:58.785 --> 11:59.818

12:02.089 --> 12:03.354
KONO:
"Sean Darius."

12:03.356 --> 12:04.823

Lou's deep cover alias.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.192
Multiple arrests

12:07.194 --> 12:11.262
for criminal assault,
manslaughter, armed robbery...

12:11.264 --> 12:13.932
Wow. Bureau put together
a pretty impressive rap sheet.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.800
Yep. It had
to be impressive,

12:15.802 --> 12:18.436
so he'd be attractive
to these guys.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.806
This is the Philly
Black Mafia.

12:21.808 --> 12:24.375
According to Joe
White's contact,

12:24.377 --> 12:26.144
these guys were
a street gang

12:26.146 --> 12:27.746
who controlled vice, drugs,

12:27.748 --> 12:28.913
even some cops.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.882
The FBI put together
a task force,

12:30.884 --> 12:33.017
went in, dismantled them
from the inside out

12:33.019 --> 12:35.487
using undercovers.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.822
Okay, but how does a Chicago cop

12:37.824 --> 12:40.058
end up in an FBI op in Philly?

12:40.060 --> 12:41.359
Well, the Bureau pulled Lou

12:41.361 --> 12:42.827
fresh out of the academy
in Chicago.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.329
CHIN: Actually,
it's a perfect choice.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.997
No one would know Lou in Philly.
Right.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.232
And once the op was over,

12:47.234 --> 12:50.068
Lou went back to Chicago
and resumed his life.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.503
Why didn't he tell us?

12:51.505 --> 12:53.538
CHIN: Well, probably too
worried about retribution.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.973
In the back
of his mind,

12:54.975 --> 12:56.207
he had to know
that was possible.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.009
That's why he kept his bags packed.
Right.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.011
So the question now is,
"Who caught up to him?"

13:00.013 --> 13:02.113
All right, well...
(touchpad beeping)

13:02.115 --> 13:05.116
this is an organizational chart
of the command structure,

13:05.118 --> 13:06.551
which ultimately consisted

13:06.553 --> 13:07.919
of these 12 guys.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.020
Now, most of these guys

13:09.022 --> 13:10.989
are either dead or
still in prison.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.257
But these two...

13:12.259 --> 13:15.160
these two had
the most to lose.

13:15.162 --> 13:18.530
Now, that is Aaron Barnes
and his son, Aaron Jr.

13:18.532 --> 13:20.298
When the old man
went away,

13:20.300 --> 13:23.868
it was the Philly equivalent
of taking down John Gotti.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.136
KONO:
Well, it says here that

13:25.138 --> 13:28.139
Barnes Sr. died in prison,
but his son

13:28.141 --> 13:29.140
was released last year.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.558
Correct.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.975
CHIN: Okay, so Junior
gets out of prison

13:31.978 --> 13:33.178
looking for revenge.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.245
It takes him a little while,

13:34.247 --> 13:35.280
but eventually
he tracks Lou down.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.281

Come down slowly!
Hands where we can see 'em!

22:06.559 --> 22:08.526
Got him?
Yeah.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.094
KONO:
Hands behind your back.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.073
It's empty.
Go and check the cargo hold.

22:22.075 --> 22:23.341
You bet.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.343
Where is everybody?

22:30.750 --> 22:32.750
Where are all
your passengers?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.985
They paid me to fly here empty.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.355
No passengers, no payload.
Who?

22:37.357 --> 22:38.556
Who paid you?

22:38.558 --> 22:40.991
A man named Barnes.
He arranged the charter.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.526
Cargo hold's empty.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.994
There's no one
aboard the plane.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.464
This was the decoy.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.600
Then where the hell's Barnes?

23:00.480 --> 23:01.912
(engine rumbling)

23:15.461 --> 23:16.794
So, these are
Agents Kheel and Strauss.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.597
They're on loan from
the Honolulu field office.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.065
This is Captain Lou Grover.
It's his family.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.767
Renee, Samantha, Will.

23:23.669 --> 23:24.902
Gentlemen.
Thank you so much.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.103
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate

23:26.105 --> 23:27.772
what you're doing
for me and my family.

23:27.774 --> 23:28.873
Thank you.
All right, guys.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.441
Watch your step,
but we got to move.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.909
Airstrip's on the other
side of the island.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.511
Okay, come on, let's go.
Give me your bag.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.578
RENEE:
Oh, thank you, baby.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.946
All right, kids,
let's go.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.536
Lou?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.938
Baby?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.039
Everything's
gonna be all right.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.774
Mm-hmm.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.510
You kids buckled
up back there?

24:06.512 --> 24:07.812
Yeah.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.680
Of course.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.882
Good, hang onto something.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.191
(gasps)

24:20.193 --> 24:21.459
Lou, honey,
what are you doing?

24:21.461 --> 24:23.727
Honolulu field
office, my ass.

24:23.729 --> 24:26.063
Those two guys look like
they've been living underground.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.865
There's not a tan line
on either one of them.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.468
Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

24:30.470 --> 24:32.002
Girl, please, I told you.
Didn't I tell you

24:32.004 --> 24:33.871
that nothing's happening to
anybody here in this car?

24:33.873 --> 24:36.474
Dad! Dad, tree! Tree!
What?! What? No!

24:40.546 --> 24:42.480
You... do you think
Zagar knows?

24:42.482 --> 24:44.682
Does he know?

24:44.684 --> 24:46.250
Baby, he's in on it.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.752
What?

24:50.723 --> 24:52.756
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

24:56.095 --> 24:58.162
(engine revs)

25:00.066 --> 25:02.132
(siren chirps)

25:04.837 --> 25:06.904
(indistinct chatter)

25:08.608 --> 25:10.241
Thank you.

25:10.243 --> 25:11.742
Duke, where are they?

25:11.744 --> 25:12.910
Over there.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.245
That dozer operator was

25:14.247 --> 25:17.281
leveling the area
when he found them.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.558
Head shots.
They were executed.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.995
Are we 100%
on these I.D.'s?

25:30.997 --> 25:32.596
Yeah, we ran a
fingerprint scan.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.899
They both came out FBI

25:34.901 --> 25:36.800
out of the Honolulu office.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.135
Agents Kheel and Strauss.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.637
So you're
telling me that

25:39.639 --> 25:40.971
Agent Zagar and the FBI's

25:40.973 --> 25:43.073
relocating Grover
and his family,

25:43.075 --> 25:45.009
and now two agents
show up murdered?

25:46.145 --> 25:47.945
You think Barnes is
taking out Zagar's detail?

25:47.947 --> 25:49.947
(phone ringing)
I don't know.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.582
Chin?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.652
Steve, I'm looking
at another private plane

25:54.654 --> 25:55.920
that departed from Pittsburgh
about two hours

25:55.922 --> 25:57.755
after our pilot left Philly.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.857
It's the same situation.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.058
They've cut off
all radio communication.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.259
Where's it heading?

26:02.261 --> 26:03.794
Looks like Moloka'i.

26:03.795 --> 26:05.328
They're on track to land there
in about ten minutes.

26:05.331 --> 26:08.032
If Barnes is on that plane
and he's heading for Moloka'i,

26:08.034 --> 26:09.733
we got to assume
that's where Agent Zagar

26:09.735 --> 26:11.335
is taking Grover
and his family.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.607
Daddy, they're behind us!

26:16.609 --> 26:18.142
I see 'em, little mama.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.044
Everybody, hold tight!

26:20.046 --> 26:21.979
(engine revs)

26:29.088 --> 26:30.321
Get ahead of it.
Cut 'em off.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.671
(grunting)

26:49.241 --> 26:50.107
Lou!

26:58.718 --> 27:00.184
Aah!

27:02.121 --> 27:03.354
(tires screech)

27:09.261 --> 27:11.161
Five-O!

27:11.163 --> 27:12.663
We're gonna need a chopper!

27:15.034 --> 27:16.333
Get out!

27:28.748 --> 27:29.980
All right. You got me?

27:29.982 --> 27:31.315
Copy.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.384
Let's go.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.240
WILL:
Tree!

28:02.415 --> 28:03.914
Daddy!

28:03.916 --> 28:05.816
(screams)
(grunts)

28:20.966 --> 28:22.766
(grunting)

28:27.273 --> 28:29.840
(groans)

28:29.842 --> 28:32.910
(grunting)

28:35.948 --> 28:37.598
What's the matter?
Put your head down.

28:37.599 --> 28:39.249
Kids, get low-- everybody get
down and stay down!

28:48.427 --> 28:49.393
Let's go!

29:02.508 --> 29:03.891
CHIN (over radio):
Steve, a plane just landed

29:03.892 --> 29:05.275
on a private strip
near Ha'upu Bay.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.144
I'm trying to get
a satellite reposition,

29:07.146 --> 29:10.347
but it's gonna take some time.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.416
All right.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.052
Looks like we're gonna do
this the old-fashioned way.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.296
(engine revving)

29:31.003 --> 29:32.336
Lou!

29:33.839 --> 29:36.340
(Grover grunting)

29:39.378 --> 29:41.011
Whew. Yeah...

29:41.013 --> 29:43.247
You okay? Baby?

29:43.249 --> 29:44.248
SAMANTHA: Yeah.
RENEE: You okay?

29:44.250 --> 29:46.316
All right.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.289
That's it, everybody.
End of the line.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.490
Car's no good.

29:53.492 --> 29:54.892
Will, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.059
SAMANTHA: What?
Come on, let's go.

29:56.061 --> 29:57.494
RENEE:
Come on.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.564
Come on, follow me this way.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.183
On me, on me!

30:02.184 --> 30:03.801
We're not gonna make it very far on foot!
Yes, we will!

30:03.803 --> 30:05.569
We got a quarter-mile
head start, let's go!

30:05.571 --> 30:08.205
Go, little girl, go!
Run! Go!

30:08.207 --> 30:10.274
Let's go! Let's go!

30:14.346 --> 30:16.079
Tire tracks.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.186
Watch your step.

30:23.589 --> 30:26.190
We gotta move!
We gotta move!

30:44.376 --> 30:46.410
It's all clear.

30:52.585 --> 30:55.085
Over there.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.231
I got the plane.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.068
No sign of Barnes.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.369
They can't have gotten too far.

31:24.984 --> 31:28.252
(phone buzzing)

31:31.390 --> 31:32.890
Yeah.

31:32.892 --> 31:33.657
BARNES JR.:
You're late.

31:33.659 --> 31:34.658
He made us.

31:34.660 --> 31:35.659
No, no.

31:35.661 --> 31:36.927
He didn't make<i> us.</i>

31:36.929 --> 31:38.128
He made you.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.330
If you lose him,
it's your damn problem.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.598
I paid you a lot of money

31:41.600 --> 31:44.301
to deliver this guy.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.569
I'll get him, Mr. Barnes.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.170
This is a temporary situation.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.405
Grover's just one man dragging

31:48.407 --> 31:49.606
his wife and kids
through the jungle.

31:49.608 --> 31:50.674
He won't get far.

31:50.676 --> 31:53.310
You better be right.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.014
Let's split up.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.082
Come with me.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.323
I got a building
on the left, Steve.

32:07.593 --> 32:11.028
I see a smokestack.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.596
Looks like an
old sugar mill.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.431
Two SUVs in the front.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.499
Got to be Barnes.

32:15.501 --> 32:16.600
Hold on, I'm
gonna peel off

32:16.602 --> 32:18.302
so they don't see us.

32:23.008 --> 32:25.642
Stay on me.
Come on, keep moving.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.085
Come on, kids,
I know you're tired...

32:35.087 --> 32:36.620
I know you're tired,
but you got to keep moving.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.688
Come on, short stuff, let's go.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.022
Come on, little mama.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.460
Let's go.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.728
We'll find them ourselves.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.371
Five-O! Drop your weapons!

32:54.373 --> 32:57.541
(automatic guns firing)

33:03.682 --> 33:04.381
(groans)

33:08.187 --> 33:10.187
GROVER: Sit down; you can rest
for a little bit, all right?

33:10.189 --> 33:11.455
But don't get comfortable,

33:11.457 --> 33:14.091
because we're gonna
be moving again soon.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.159
(quietly): Not you.
RENEE: What?

33:18.097 --> 33:19.696
GROVER: Listen.
RENEE: What?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.532
There's no way in the world
we're gonna be able

33:22.534 --> 33:24.067
to outrun Zagar and his men.

33:25.571 --> 33:28.105
Well, what are we gonna do?

33:30.576 --> 33:32.309
We're gonna
have to do something

33:32.311 --> 33:35.045
that they're not gonna
expect us to do, okay?

33:35.047 --> 33:38.281
Renee, I need you to stay
here with the kids.

33:38.283 --> 33:39.733
No, no...

33:39.734 --> 33:41.184
Look, Renee, this is
life and death.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.453
Hold that pistol like
you know how to hold it.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.224
Now, you know how to use
that thing, right?

33:47.226 --> 33:48.759
You remember.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.293
You aim for the biggest
part of the body.

33:50.295 --> 33:51.561
Center mass.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.597
Baby, please...
Sweetheart, listen to me.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.632
You think I'd do this
if I had another option?

33:55.634 --> 33:56.733
I don't have another option.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.201
I'm gonna end
this thing.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.270
I'm gonna end this thing
now, you understand?

34:02.074 --> 34:03.140
Okay.

34:04.643 --> 34:07.411
Okay, um, guys...

34:08.714 --> 34:10.180
Yeah, this is good.

34:10.182 --> 34:13.717
Okay, listen,
I'm gonna need you

34:13.719 --> 34:15.585
to stay here with your
mother, understand?

34:15.587 --> 34:17.054
Wait, wait,
where are you going?

34:17.056 --> 34:18.822
I gotta go head
these guys off.

34:18.823 --> 34:20.589
I gotta find these guys
before they find you...

34:20.592 --> 34:23.427
Come on, Dad. and your sister
and your mother, okay?

34:23.429 --> 34:25.595
Dad, you can't leave us here alone.
Hey, listen to me!

34:26.665 --> 34:29.399
You think I want
to leave you?

34:29.401 --> 34:33.136
You think I want to
leave my little girl?

34:33.138 --> 34:36.173
Now, I don't
have a choice.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.175
So I need you to promise

34:38.177 --> 34:41.711
that you're gonna stay close
to your mother and stay hidden.

34:41.713 --> 34:45.182
And you, you're my son,
and I know you, all right?

34:45.184 --> 34:47.317
Look at me--
I'm not playing.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.319
I don't care what
sound you hear

34:49.321 --> 34:52.656
or what you think in your mind,
do not come and look for me.

34:52.658 --> 34:55.292
Dad...

34:58.130 --> 34:59.196
Dad...

35:00.265 --> 35:01.298
(sniffles)

35:01.300 --> 35:04.201
Lil' mommy's gonna
be fine, okay?

35:08.273 --> 35:10.140
GROVER: All right,
do what I told you to do.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.508
I gotta go.

35:13.112 --> 35:14.311
WILL: Dad.
GROVER: Yeah?

35:20.519 --> 35:22.185
You might need this.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.863
You're a good boy, Will;
you're a good boy.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.267
Look, it's all gonna be fine.

35:37.269 --> 35:40.504
I got a corkscrew,
I got a toothpick.

35:40.506 --> 35:43.373
I got some scissors.
(laughing)

35:43.375 --> 35:46.376
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

35:46.378 --> 35:47.444
Okay.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.847
Listen, you can do this.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.382
You can do this.
You're tougher than me.

35:52.384 --> 35:53.717
You don't believe me?
Ask the kids.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.385
They both know
I'm scared of you.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.494
I love you so much.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.830
I love you.
I love you.

36:08.233 --> 36:10.233
Baby, your heart
is pounding.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.769
Babe... my heart's been
pounding like that

36:12.771 --> 36:14.571
ever since I met you.

36:17.342 --> 36:20.877
Hey, hey, smile.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.213
