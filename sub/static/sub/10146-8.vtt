the Troubles is Northern Ireland.
If he is teaming up with Kwon

00:05.345 --> 00:07.305
and Li-Na, God knows
what they are planning.

00:07.306 --> 00:11.099
Just think of all the damage done
to these families, these children,

00:11.100 --> 00:12.608
for your sins.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.219
Bomb! Move! Move!

00:18.140 --> 00:21.299
I've got your target in sight.
I am going to follow.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.060
This one is FSB. She has been
after me for a long time.

00:26.300 --> 00:29.304
- We are only here for one thing.
- Take us to the vault.

00:31.810 --> 00:33.810
This is it. You did it!

- One second...
- Where are you going?

00:54.067 --> 00:55.277
Give me one minute!

00:56.793 --> 00:57.872
Shit.

00:57.873 --> 00:59.623
You! Come here!

00:59.624 --> 01:00.672
Come here!

01:00.673 --> 01:02.872
- Jackpot.
- Open this door!

01:02.873 --> 01:04.473
It doesn't open on this side!

01:06.014 --> 01:08.425
- I brought some toys for us.
- Move away!

01:08.426 --> 01:09.913
Here.

01:12.233 --> 01:13.473
We're on.

01:18.593 --> 01:19.953
Fire in the hole!

01:23.676 --> 01:25.300

01:26.324 --> 01:28.871
_

01:32.005 --> 01:33.154
_

01:38.753 --> 01:40.550
It won't just be 20 after us now.

01:40.551 --> 01:41.644
Our own regime...

01:41.645 --> 01:44.512
Our own regime was too
scared to act. We're not.

01:44.513 --> 01:47.073
And now, we have the codes we need.

01:54.153 --> 01:55.751
- Scott, ***
- That way.

01:57.811 --> 01:59.022
Clear.

01:59.023 --> 02:01.153
- Mike. Hey.
- Yeah.

02:10.097 --> 02:12.994
_

02:12.995 --> 02:15.778
_

02:17.351 --> 02:20.549
- Where's the Li-Na?
- There can't be another way out of here.

02:25.543 --> 02:28.233
- I got Nina.
- I'm going after Li-Na.

02:42.813 --> 02:43.873
Move.

02:47.587 --> 02:49.835
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.760
Don't kill him. We need him alive.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.905
You need him alive.

02:54.906 --> 02:58.378
I keep him alive. A quick
death is too good for him.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.794
Oh, shit!

03:09.004 --> 03:13.113
- I'm OK. Go!
- Yes, ma'am! RV later.

03:30.219 --> 03:32.517
Helmet off! Get the helmet off!

03:34.553 --> 03:35.873
All right.

03:40.273 --> 03:41.707
I saved you a spot.

04:13.673 --> 04:15.508
You know you've got the wrong men?

04:15.509 --> 04:17.748
You let the right ones get
past, you stupid asshole.

04:17.749 --> 04:19.709
- Asshole?
- Yeah.

04:21.509 --> 04:23.389
I never said anything. He did.

04:26.149 --> 04:27.508
Sorry, mate.

04:27.509 --> 04:29.468
Who are you?

04:29.469 --> 04:31.772
Why did you rob this bank?

04:31.773 --> 04:34.028
All right, I didn't rob the bank.

04:34.029 --> 04:36.468
- We are nobody.
- Oh, come now...

04:36.469 --> 04:37.868
everybody is somebody.

04:37.869 --> 04:41.617
I wonder what we'll find when I run
your picture through our database.

04:41.618 --> 04:43.429
Turn around... now.

04:50.269 --> 04:52.780
I really hate having my picture taken.

04:53.341 --> 04:56.628
- It's nothing personal.
- Yeah, we love the cops.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.468
And we're not stealing this.

04:58.469 --> 05:00.762
Those photos might put us in the system.
We'll burn that bridge

05:00.763 --> 05:03.268
- when we get to it. What about Nina?
- She's all right.

05:03.269 --> 05:06.149
She had it under control. Let's
go get a lecture from Locke.

05:15.989 --> 05:17.829
It is everything you wanted.

05:47.709 --> 05:49.109
You are somewhere else.

05:52.709 --> 05:55.789
I was... just thinking of home.

05:57.349 --> 06:00.028
And now we will never see it again.

06:00.029 --> 06:01.588
You miss it.

06:01.589 --> 06:04.068
I miss what it should have been.

06:04.069 --> 06:05.788
I'll miss...

06:05.789 --> 06:09.548
what it will become,
should we be successful.

06:09.549 --> 06:12.788
We couldn't have stayed there any longer.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.948
I know.

06:14.949 --> 06:16.988
It's just...

06:16.989 --> 06:21.108
driving here, I saw people
drinking coffee together,

06:21.109 --> 06:23.068
shopping...

06:23.069 --> 06:25.148
blissfully unaware

06:25.149 --> 06:27.468
of the chaotic world around them.

06:27.469 --> 06:29.348
You want that to be us?

06:29.349 --> 06:31.628
Don't you?

06:31.629 --> 06:34.828
We made a choice when we left Korea,

06:34.829 --> 06:38.028
to change the country, to
stop the rot and decay.

06:38.029 --> 06:41.548
Yes, I wish we had more time to be...

06:41.549 --> 06:45.708
to be normal, but we made a choice.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.629
You and me together...

06:49.869 --> 06:51.749
no matter what.

07:36.594 --> 07:39.188
What the hell is that? We're
supposed to be low key.

07:39.189 --> 07:42.028
- Yeah, we just borrowed it.
- Yeah. We don't do low key very well.

07:42.029 --> 07:45.428
You'd better learn quick.
We're on a tight leash here.

07:45.429 --> 07:49.188
So, we know all Li-Na was
after was a notebook.

07:49.189 --> 07:52.189
And my little friend here wants
to tell you all about it.

07:53.869 --> 07:55.149
Don't you, Ivan?

07:57.749 --> 08:00.508
It was just symbols in it.

08:00.509 --> 08:01.868
Korean.

08:01.869 --> 08:04.588
- Some kind of code.
- And?

08:04.589 --> 08:05.949
And...

08:07.989 --> 08:11.108
Li-Na needed some kid,

08:11.109 --> 08:13.360
some egghead, to try and crack it.

08:13.361 --> 08:15.668
Do you know what this kid looks like?

08:15.669 --> 08:19.388
All the details you need. Ivan
has been very co-operative.

08:19.389 --> 08:21.881
Please... I am begging you...

08:21.882 --> 08:25.881
man-to-man, don't leave me with her.
You have no idea what she is going

08:25.882 --> 08:28.349
- to do to me.
- Yeah, I do.

08:32.549 --> 08:34.268
You know what?

08:34.269 --> 08:37.308
Screw you. And screw the bitch!

08:39.429 --> 08:43.136
Screw you. That's no way
to talk about a lady.

08:44.749 --> 08:48.749
- You are handing him over to the FSB?
- Yes... eventually.

08:50.269 --> 08:51.669
Take care, guys.

08:59.469 --> 09:01.389
And next time you're in trouble...

09:02.829 --> 09:04.189
call someone else.

09:14.949 --> 09:17.668
How much longer?

09:17.669 --> 09:21.188
That depends... whether
you want it done quickly

09:21.189 --> 09:22.948
or you want it done right.

09:22.949 --> 09:24.788
I was hoping for both.

09:24.789 --> 09:27.628
I am building you something unique,

09:27.629 --> 09:31.428
something nobody has ever
perfected before. Do you know why?

09:31.429 --> 09:34.348
Because it's near impossible.

09:34.349 --> 09:36.548
Everything has to be perfectly balanced,

09:36.549 --> 09:39.428
from the reflector to the lenses.

09:39.429 --> 09:43.148
And, believe me, when you're
transporting this across country,

09:43.149 --> 09:45.788
you'll be glad I erred
on the side of caution.

09:45.789 --> 09:50.348
It has never concerned you, has
it - the deaths, the injuries

09:50.349 --> 09:54.828
- that your devices cause?
- Aren't we both in the same business?

09:54.829 --> 09:58.428
I am fighting for a cause. Those that fall

09:58.429 --> 10:02.508
are sacrifices to what is a better future.
There is no joy in it.

10:02.509 --> 10:03.908
But your main interest

10:03.909 --> 10:07.548
seems to begin and end with money.

10:07.549 --> 10:11.463
No. My only interest is the work.

10:11.464 --> 10:14.908
Money is security. It means
the buyer is serious

10:14.909 --> 10:17.668
and I don't have my security compromised.

10:17.669 --> 10:20.828
I also won't have people like
Philip Locke knocking on my door.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.748
You know him from your
time in Northern Ireland?

10:23.749 --> 10:27.068
Well, for Philip Locke, I
am the man in the window -

10:27.069 --> 10:30.028
the uninvited guest in the shadows.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.268
He doesn't see the strange
beauty in what I do.

10:32.269 --> 10:35.748
Death and destruction is never beautiful.

10:35.749 --> 10:39.869
Our actions have cause. It is
never something I take lightly.

10:41.469 --> 10:45.348
Yeah, well, you would say
the wiring's a bit faulty.

10:45.349 --> 10:48.228
Something doesn't quite fit.

10:48.229 --> 10:49.708
You're an idealist.

10:49.709 --> 10:51.948
To me, that is even stranger.

10:51.949 --> 10:55.109
You believe in people. To me, they are...

10:56.309 --> 10:58.508
incomplete.

10:58.509 --> 11:00.188
Speaking of which,

11:00.189 --> 11:03.828
I can't move any further
without the vital component.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.949
The Tin Man needs a heart, as it were.

11:07.909 --> 11:09.629
We shall get it soon.

11:27.277 --> 11:28.582
Here we are.

11:28.583 --> 11:30.263
- Is that it?
- That's us.

11:35.023 --> 11:37.343
Boss, everything looks
clear from the outside.

11:38.903 --> 11:42.782
OK, just this once, try
and proceed with caution.

11:42.783 --> 11:45.753
We need to extract the decoder and
find out what's in this notebook

11:45.754 --> 11:49.582
that's so important to Li-Na.
What I'm trying to say is,

11:49.583 --> 11:52.663
- please don't get him killed.
- OK, let's go.

11:57.106 --> 11:58.729
_

12:13.125 --> 12:15.310
_

12:41.923 --> 12:42.983
Idiot.

12:46.263 --> 12:47.902
Kid. Cookie?

12:47.903 --> 12:50.223
No. Gluten-intolerant.

13:15.983 --> 13:18.143
Excuse me, do you know
where an ice machine is?

13:28.829 --> 13:30.128
_

13:32.265 --> 13:35.442
- Down! Put it down!
- Put it down! Put it down!

13:35.443 --> 13:37.927
You know if we're here, we've
already got to your boss's mission, right?

13:37.928 --> 13:39.802
It's all over.

13:39.803 --> 13:43.287
This is a one-time offer - drop the
gun and take a walk. Your choice.

13:43.288 --> 13:45.060
_

13:45.061 --> 13:47.762
_

13:47.763 --> 13:49.163
Don't put that gun up.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.471
- Are you The Kid?
- Yeah.

13:54.472 --> 13:57.242
You're The Kid. Pack your stuff.
You're coming with us.

13:57.243 --> 13:59.534
- Come on.
- You just shot those people!

13:59.535 --> 14:00.642
That was self-defence.

14:00.643 --> 14:02.551
We didn't shoot them all, anyway.
We're the good guys.

14:02.552 --> 14:05.202
Good guys?! No-one was
shooting before you got here!

14:05.203 --> 14:06.803
- Yeah, that happens a lot.
- Let's go.

14:08.544 --> 14:09.802
_

14:09.803 --> 14:11.763
Not this way, not this way!

14:16.323 --> 14:18.787
Hey, Kid, do you have a fear of heights?

14:18.788 --> 14:21.323
Acrophobia. That's a fear of heights.

14:22.643 --> 14:24.155
Do you have a fear of shutting your mouth?

14:24.156 --> 14:27.002
Sedatephobia - that is a fear of silence.

14:27.003 --> 14:29.017
- Shit!
- Argh!

14:29.018 --> 14:30.901
- There you go.
- Come on!

14:37.483 --> 14:39.817
- Let's move. Think you can make that?
- Yeah.

14:39.818 --> 14:41.642
- You?
- Yeah. What about The Kid?

14:41.643 --> 14:44.380
My name is Matthias. And,
no, I can't, obviously.

14:44.381 --> 14:47.523
- I mean... The power to weight ratio...
- Shut up! You'll be fine.

14:50.603 --> 14:52.013
All right, your turn. Let's go.

14:52.014 --> 14:53.682
- I really can't.
- Scott!

14:53.683 --> 14:55.362
Kid, it's like Donkey Kong.

14:55.363 --> 14:58.402
You are jumping from level to level.
You've played Donkey Kong, yeah?

14:58.403 --> 15:01.649
Donkey Kong? How old are you?!
This clearly isn't a game.

15:01.650 --> 15:02.736
I'm not jumping.

15:04.643 --> 15:06.162
If you're not jumping, you won't need this.

15:06.163 --> 15:08.353
- No, no, wait! No!
- There you go!

15:08.354 --> 15:10.127
You want that back, go get it.

15:12.408 --> 15:13.923
- Argh!
- There you go, buddy!

15:17.877 --> 15:21.350
Nice. So, we're going to go
across there, like Donkey Kong.

15:21.351 --> 15:23.147
Level up or down. Move back.

15:23.148 --> 15:24.683
- Let's go. Hurry up.
- Yeah, I know.

15:26.363 --> 15:28.082
Guys...

15:28.083 --> 15:30.043
Or we're going in there. Go, go, go!

15:36.933 --> 15:38.532
_

15:38.533 --> 15:40.280
_

15:41.641 --> 15:42.940
Put him up.

15:45.723 --> 15:47.021
Get in, get in.

15:51.123 --> 15:53.851
Boss, we have The Kid and his intel.

16:00.643 --> 16:03.464
- Hey, Kid, you have other phone?
- What?

16:03.465 --> 16:04.602
Give me your phone.

16:04.603 --> 16:07.187
- I am going to call someone.
- Ah, yeah.

16:07.188 --> 16:09.323
Thanks. It's a great one.

16:10.523 --> 16:13.082
What?! No, no, no! That's not insured, man!

16:13.083 --> 16:14.843
Well, I'll buy you a new one.

16:24.820 --> 16:26.842
You all right back there, Kid?

16:26.843 --> 16:29.962
The normal resting heart rate for
an adult is between 60 and 100

16:29.963 --> 16:33.362
- beats per minute. I am way over that.
- Just try and relax.

16:33.363 --> 16:35.242
Breathe. Breathe.

16:35.243 --> 16:37.322
You're going to be fine. You're safe now.

16:37.323 --> 16:38.740
We work for the British government.

16:38.741 --> 16:41.322
- British?
- Yeah.

16:41.323 --> 16:44.882
- Where did they find you?
- Ah... I'm at university.

16:44.883 --> 16:47.402
They needed someone to break a
cipher and they just took...

16:47.403 --> 16:48.722
So, you're a hacker?

16:48.723 --> 16:51.522
What? No. Please. I am a cryptanalyst.

16:51.523 --> 16:54.762
I decipher codes - complex
interlocking structures,

16:54.763 --> 16:57.251
whose very nature conceals their
true identity from the mind's eye.

16:57.252 --> 17:00.722
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Did you break the code?

17:00.723 --> 17:02.268
I managed three so far.

17:02.269 --> 17:04.801
- What do they say?
- I don't know, it's in Korean.

17:04.803 --> 17:07.602
I don't do languages. I mean, if
you can speak English and German,

17:07.603 --> 17:09.842
what the fuck is the point?
I don't buy all this

17:09.843 --> 17:12.012
"Mandarin is the language of
the future" bullshit, either.

17:12.012 --> 17:13.087
Oi! Oi!

17:13.723 --> 17:17.123
My task was to crack the codes and
send them on. That's what I did.

17:18.730 --> 17:19.829
So, you decoded

17:19.830 --> 17:21.682
- and sent three of the codes, yeah?
- Yeah.

17:21.683 --> 17:24.444
- How many more were there?
- Nine. 12, in total.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.482
Right, then, we need you
to decode the rest, for us.

17:27.483 --> 17:30.642
We also need the details
on where you sent them.

17:30.643 --> 17:33.402
Then I need somewhere proper to work.
I get car sick.

17:33.403 --> 17:35.122
And he is not a very good driver.

17:35.123 --> 17:37.283
I've been saying that for years.

18:02.683 --> 18:05.522
'Li-Na... the decoder is gone.'

18:05.523 --> 18:06.706
Taken by 20.

18:06.707 --> 18:09.802
- We need the rest of those names.
- I know.

18:09.803 --> 18:12.442
I'll get them back. You
have the first three?

18:12.443 --> 18:15.403
Yes. We have the one we need now.

18:16.603 --> 18:18.963
Tin Man will get his heart.

18:22.523 --> 18:24.083
We must find him.

18:33.923 --> 18:35.471
I'm just going to get this.

18:36.843 --> 18:38.096
Hello, this is Heo.

18:39.195 --> 18:40.519
_

18:41.293 --> 18:44.240
_

18:45.951 --> 18:48.361
_

18:50.547 --> 18:52.070
_

18:52.420 --> 18:54.330
_

18:54.331 --> 18:56.128
_

18:57.443 --> 18:59.043
It is happening.

18:59.737 --> 19:01.335
_

19:23.803 --> 19:26.762
The average laptop has twice as
many germs in it as a toilet seat.

19:26.763 --> 19:30.122
E Coli, Staphylococcus bacteria.

19:30.123 --> 19:31.603
Will we start work?

19:33.203 --> 19:36.202
- You get paid much in the army?
- No.

19:36.203 --> 19:38.842
Not nearly enough.

19:38.843 --> 19:41.602
Yeah, we've got him working on
the rest of the codes right now.

19:41.603 --> 19:44.482
I'm not sure how long it's going to
take, and he's a little uptight.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.642
Any idea about the three we sent through?

19:46.643 --> 19:50.082
It's definitely in Korean.
It's a list of names.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.693
Just running searches on them now.

19:54.003 --> 19:56.067
I'm going to forward you the e-mail
he was sending them to.

19:56.068 --> 19:57.322
Good.

19:57.323 --> 20:01.082
I'll run a trace on the IP address.
See if it leads us to Li-Na.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.698
And send the other decodes as soon
as you get them.

20:03.699 --> 20:05.267
Yeah, roger that.

20:08.323 --> 20:10.560
You want to have some
coffee with your sugar?

20:10.561 --> 20:12.147
What do you mean?

20:13.763 --> 20:15.922
Nothing.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.402
How are things going?

20:17.403 --> 20:20.042
The cipher changes itself
from line to line,

20:20.043 --> 20:22.866
so I'm currently analysing the
cryptographic algorithm itself

20:22.867 --> 20:25.602
in order to be able to...

20:25.603 --> 20:28.802
Good or bad? That's all you need to say.

20:28.803 --> 20:30.802
You're quite an angry person.

20:30.803 --> 20:34.002
- No, I'm not. Not normally.
- Well, he does have a point.

20:34.003 --> 20:36.602
- Really? You're siding with The Kid?
- I'm not siding with him.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.011
It's just the first thing he's said
today that I actually understand.

20:39.012 --> 20:41.064
- Can you understand that?
- Yes, I can.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.282
That's your penis.

20:42.283 --> 20:45.402
- No, it's a fucking finger.
- The middle finger represents the penis,

20:45.403 --> 20:48.082
while the two curled fingers on
either side are the genitals.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.322
It's similar to how a monkey copulates

20:50.323 --> 20:53.682
- with its enemies to show dominance.
- Finished?

20:53.683 --> 20:55.522
I like him. I do.

20:55.523 --> 20:57.763
- You want to get back to work?
- Yeah.

21:01.083 --> 21:04.002
Don't blame you for being angry.

21:04.003 --> 21:07.562
Must be a difficult time for
men in your line of work.

21:07.563 --> 21:12.082
Technology is taking over.
Drones, cyber warfare...

21:12.083 --> 21:14.762
The average teenager could
do more damage in 20 minutes

21:14.763 --> 21:17.562
with a mobile phone than a soldier
like you could do in a week.

21:17.563 --> 21:21.202
I can do a lot of damage in 20
seconds if you keep pushing it, Kid.

21:21.203 --> 21:22.722
Toilet break.

21:22.723 --> 21:24.882
Oi, oi, sit down.

21:24.883 --> 21:27.002
Sorry.

21:27.003 --> 21:30.162
Keep working on the codes, please.

21:30.163 --> 21:33.938
This has been very upsetting for me.
Today I saw people getting killed,

21:33.939 --> 21:35.525
and now you're physically intimidating me.

21:35.526 --> 21:36.560
Hey, hey, just...

21:36.561 --> 21:39.402
- I did not choose this.
- Look, I know.

21:39.403 --> 21:41.242
I know you're scared.

21:41.243 --> 21:43.402
You're in a shitty situation.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.362
I've got a kid myself.

21:45.363 --> 21:48.122
He's a little younger than you.

21:48.123 --> 21:53.436
Just trust me, I'm not going to let
anything happen, all right? So...

21:55.723 --> 21:58.362
Fine, I'll finish decoding
the names when I get back.

21:58.363 --> 22:00.882
I really need to urinate now, though.

22:00.883 --> 22:02.883
Way too much information.

22:08.163 --> 22:11.722
Wow. You can thank your lucky stars
that Finn didn't turn out like that.

22:11.723 --> 22:14.762
Yeah. I would have left him in Korea.

22:14.763 --> 22:17.242
How's he doing, mate? Is he OK?

22:17.243 --> 22:19.362
Yeah. He's good.

22:19.363 --> 22:21.280
He's back with his mom.

22:21.281 --> 22:23.962
- Does she know?
- No.

22:23.963 --> 22:27.282
And luckily enough, he's
not going to tell her.

22:27.283 --> 22:31.672
I hope. You know, weirdly, Mike,
nearly getting killed together...

22:33.203 --> 22:35.802
sort of brought us together.

22:35.803 --> 22:38.602
Maybe you should try that with Matthias.

22:38.603 --> 22:41.002
- How did he know that they were names?
- What?

22:41.003 --> 22:43.642
Locke told me the encrypted
codes came out as names.

22:43.643 --> 22:47.403
If he doesn't know the languages, how does
he know they were names, the little shit?!

22:49.003 --> 22:50.802
- Locked.
- No shit.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.483
- Scott.
- Oh, shit.

22:56.496 --> 22:57.770
_

22:59.937 --> 23:01.623
Kid, hey!

23:01.624 --> 23:03.802
Wait, stop.

23:03.803 --> 23:06.762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys.
I can't do this!

23:06.763 --> 23:10.206
- Don't be sorry. Just stop.
- I can't be who you want me to be,

23:10.207 --> 23:13.402
I've got to get home. My mother is
going to be so worried about me.

23:13.403 --> 23:15.482
Enough of your bullshit about your mom.

23:15.483 --> 23:18.042
What are you going to do?

23:18.043 --> 23:19.402
Stop!

23:19.403 --> 23:21.522
Stop.

23:21.523 --> 23:26.162
You are the dumbest fuck I ever met.
Come on, man!

23:26.163 --> 23:28.525
We both know you're not going to shoot me.

23:28.526 --> 23:30.422
- Really?
- Argh!

23:36.283 --> 23:37.843
What took you so long?!

23:42.723 --> 23:43.742
Shit!

23:45.245 --> 23:47.322
Ah, bollocks!

23:47.323 --> 23:50.680
He let the air out of the tyres.
Little shit!

24:02.805 --> 24:06.604
Fuck. I can't believe he shot me.
There's blood and everything!

24:06.605 --> 24:08.045
The names.

24:08.046 --> 24:10.245
I left my laptop. Deleted
everything from it.

24:10.246 --> 24:11.642
You don't have the translated codes?

24:11.643 --> 24:13.726
- Given me a pen and paper.
- In there.

24:21.286 --> 24:24.885
- Is this the way to the hospital?
- You've memorised them?

24:24.886 --> 24:27.245
Don't insult my intelligence,
this was child's play.

24:27.246 --> 24:30.325
Oh, and by the way, those Russian
guys you had guarding me - useless.

24:30.326 --> 24:32.605
One of them practically
rolled over and gave up.

24:32.606 --> 24:35.126
I'd look into my employment
practices if I were you.

24:36.286 --> 24:39.366
You talk too much. It concerns me.

24:44.926 --> 24:47.365
Can you go to the hospital now, please?

24:47.366 --> 24:49.006
I don't want this to get infected.

24:54.086 --> 24:55.897
No, no, no!

24:59.606 --> 25:00.606
Better.

25:05.486 --> 25:07.326
- Here is he?
- Scott.

25:16.206 --> 25:18.245
Go, boss.

25:18.246 --> 25:21.685
So while you two were
busy losing the source,

25:21.686 --> 25:24.645
I made some progress on the names we got.

25:24.646 --> 25:26.925
- One of them works here in Vienna.
- And?

25:26.926 --> 25:29.285
And I think they're
Office 39 sleeper agents.

25:29.286 --> 25:33.125
And if I'm right, that
is very bad news indeed,

25:33.126 --> 25:36.125
because one of them is Heo
Gil Rae, senior scientist

25:36.126 --> 25:39.685
at the International Nuclear
Research Organisation.

25:39.686 --> 25:41.806
Second scan for confirmation.

25:58.926 --> 26:01.886
Move out in five. Route 17C.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.748
_

26:12.749 --> 26:14.147
_

26:15.686 --> 26:18.525
So put the pieces together - we have Li-Na,

26:18.526 --> 26:20.325
we have Oppenheimer,

26:20.326 --> 26:23.365
a man whose skills in constructing
explosives are second to none.

26:23.366 --> 26:26.205
And a possible sleeper agent
with access to nuclear material.

26:26.206 --> 26:28.966
- Exactly.
- So she's building a fucking nuke.

26:46.686 --> 26:50.685
The intel just came in
from the calls I put out.

26:50.686 --> 26:53.325
An unscheduled convoy
carrying nuclear materials

26:53.326 --> 26:55.926
just left the INRO 15 minutes ago.

26:57.446 --> 27:01.405
Convoy's destination is
a lab at Wolkersdorf.

27:01.406 --> 27:03.365
This is the route it follows.

27:03.366 --> 27:05.365
You think Li-Na's going
to try and intercept?

27:05.366 --> 27:08.165
Mm-hm, and I think you
should get there first.

27:08.166 --> 27:11.565
CCTV's just caught it crossing
the motorway at Erdberg.

27:11.566 --> 27:14.685
Get ahead of it and apprehend it.

27:14.686 --> 27:16.685
Stay on comms, I'll be out.

27:16.686 --> 27:20.805
I ran a trace on the address
Matthias was sending the e-mails to.

27:20.806 --> 27:25.005
- What, did you get something?
- Yeah, I triangulated the location.

27:25.006 --> 27:27.125
It's a construction site

27:27.126 --> 27:31.126
owned by our little Russian
friend, Ivan Myshkin.

27:49.137 --> 27:50.206
I'm sorry.

27:52.446 --> 27:53.686
Move!

28:19.686 --> 28:21.966
I need the other key.

28:23.446 --> 28:25.765
- It is necessary.
- Argh!

29:13.806 --> 29:16.925
That's them, that's them.
Boss, we see the convoy.

29:16.926 --> 29:19.485
It's been hit, they've taken heavy fire.
We're going in hot.

29:19.486 --> 29:20.965
Yeah, copy that, Michael.

29:20.966 --> 29:23.085
Do not let them gain
access to the material.

29:23.086 --> 29:24.246
Stay on comms.

29:42.126 --> 29:44.645
There's a door here!

29:44.646 --> 29:47.006
Move! What do you mean,
there's a fucking door?

29:49.726 --> 29:52.083
There's a fucking door, that's what I mean!

29:52.084 --> 29:53.207
Move it!

30:03.806 --> 30:05.126
Scott, move!

30:10.675 --> 30:11.762
Fuck!

30:14.372 --> 30:16.925
Armoured!

30:16.926 --> 30:18.206
Let's get out of here.

30:19.806 --> 30:21.846
Fuck you guys!

30:29.526 --> 30:31.365
Shit!

30:31.366 --> 30:33.206
Get us out of here, mate!

32:04.566 --> 32:06.073
Turn around.

32:16.488 --> 32:18.365
Ah.

32:18.366 --> 32:20.445
Do you know who I am?

32:20.446 --> 32:23.005
Yes, Philip, I know who you are.

32:23.006 --> 32:26.126
I'd also like to point out the
fact that I'm an unarmed man.

32:27.806 --> 32:30.485
Did you kill my son?

32:30.486 --> 32:34.006
- Put the gun away, and then we'll talk.
- No.

32:34.863 --> 32:37.765
No, you don't get to tell me what to do.

32:37.766 --> 32:40.346
- You answer the question.
- You stand still!

32:42.366 --> 32:44.726
Did you kill my son?

32:46.806 --> 32:49.165
The car, the bomb -

32:49.166 --> 32:51.046
it was you, wasn't it?

32:53.406 --> 32:55.325
I swear to God, if you don't tell me...

32:55.326 --> 32:58.685
I - I want to. And I will.

32:58.686 --> 33:02.845
But Jesus Christ, Philip, you're
asking all the wrong questions.

33:02.846 --> 33:05.166
What even makes you think it was me?

33:08.526 --> 33:10.445
It was that phrase.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.725
"For your sins"?

33:12.726 --> 33:16.405
Ha! God, I could never shake that phrase.

33:16.406 --> 33:19.765
Changed everything else, but I
could never shake that phrase.

33:19.766 --> 33:22.485
That's what five bloody years of
seminary school does for you.

33:22.486 --> 33:24.805
I don't know what it is
about the Catholic Church

33:24.806 --> 33:27.245
that attracts sadists and psychopaths.

33:27.246 --> 33:28.419
Mind you,

33:28.420 --> 33:31.180
- you could say the same about the army.
- No, just...

33:31.521 --> 33:35.845
Stop the games. I said stand still!
You don't move.

33:35.846 --> 33:38.846
Hands where I can see them. Look at me.

33:43.166 --> 33:46.125
Did you kill my son?

33:46.126 --> 33:49.165
- You're asking all the wrong questions.
- Did you?!

33:49.166 --> 33:53.365
Philip, I set the charge,
I pushed the button.

33:53.366 --> 33:55.566
But it wasn't about your family.

33:56.846 --> 33:58.805
Don't you understand?

33:58.806 --> 34:01.165
For yours sins.

34:01.166 --> 34:03.365
It was about you.

34:03.366 --> 34:07.566
You were the one I was meant to
kill to keep my cover intact.

34:10.246 --> 34:11.686
Your cover?

34:14.846 --> 34:16.965
My name is Christopher Desmond.

34:16.966 --> 34:19.326
I worked for the British, same as you.

34:22.286 --> 34:25.005
The British government
sanctioned my murder?

34:29.126 --> 34:32.885
- I don't believe you.
- Except that you do.

34:32.886 --> 34:36.245
Because you've been asking
yourself, "Why doesn't he exist?

34:36.246 --> 34:39.284
"Why are there no files, no records?

34:39.286 --> 34:42.205
"Why is there no trace
of his existence, hm?

34:42.206 --> 34:45.686
"Who'd be able to do
such a thing, and why?"

34:47.766 --> 34:50.960
If not to cover up the fact that they
tried to murder one of their own.

35:00.286 --> 35:02.286
The next one's in your head.

35:07.566 --> 35:09.606
Who ordered my murder?

35:11.046 --> 35:13.446
- I don't know.
- Who?

35:20.766 --> 35:21.886
Argh!

35:32.326 --> 35:34.045
- Brilliant.
- What?

35:34.046 --> 35:37.390
I think we've got company.
Coming up on our six.

35:37.391 --> 35:40.942
It's Kwon. That fucker won't quit.

35:40.943 --> 35:43.542
Get out of the way! Move!

35:43.543 --> 35:46.663
- Try and keep it on the road, mate.
- No back-seat driving today, bud.

35:46.664 --> 35:49.064
OK, fine. I'll leave.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.583
He's coming up on your
right-hand side, Scott.

36:19.823 --> 36:21.503
- Mikey, hold on.
- Go, go, go!

36:23.903 --> 36:26.103
You want to stop me...? Come that!

36:28.783 --> 36:31.343
Scott, they're closing in!

36:33.463 --> 36:36.072
Move! Move!

36:48.663 --> 36:50.822
You!

36:50.823 --> 36:54.743
It was you! You killed my son!

36:56.303 --> 36:58.142
I was the weapon.

36:58.143 --> 37:01.462
Somebody else chose the
target, somebody else aimed.

37:01.463 --> 37:03.943
Oh, right. What, and missed?

37:07.511 --> 37:10.062
What? This nuclear bomb, huh?

37:10.063 --> 37:12.542
That's not your responsibility, either?

37:12.543 --> 37:15.902
For the death, the suffering.

37:15.903 --> 37:18.542
What do you care now?

37:18.543 --> 37:20.383
I never stopped caring.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.502
Still desperately struggling

37:23.503 --> 37:26.222
to hold on to this identity
you've created, huh?

37:26.223 --> 37:30.622
Boys with sticks for guns, running
round the woods, the absolute game.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.142
It's not a game. I'm a soldier.

37:33.143 --> 37:36.702
Trying to save the world,
one corpse at a time.

37:36.703 --> 37:39.263
Be who you really are. You're a killer.

37:40.823 --> 37:45.804
Your bombs killed innocent
men, women and children.

37:47.623 --> 37:49.342
My own son.

37:49.343 --> 37:51.782
And you just put two bullets
into that man there

37:51.783 --> 37:55.623
without breaking sweat. Was he
not somebody else's son, too?

37:57.703 --> 37:59.822
And now you've left your team in the field

37:59.823 --> 38:01.543
to settle a personal score with me.

38:02.727 --> 38:05.222
- ***
- What is that?

38:05.223 --> 38:09.302
- I think we're stopping, Mike.
- Bollocks! Come on!

38:09.303 --> 38:11.902
There's nothing I can do,
Mike, we're stopping.

38:11.903 --> 38:14.422
That's the difference between you and me.

38:14.423 --> 38:18.622
I've accepted my nature.
That I was different. You know?

38:18.623 --> 38:22.582
When other men shied away from the
fire and the noise, I sought it out.

38:22.583 --> 38:24.622
And you're the same, Philip.

38:24.623 --> 38:27.142
Any other man would have
been broken - broken -

38:27.143 --> 38:30.742
after what he did to the people he
cared for, to the people he loved.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.862
I'm not staying here.
We've got to stop them.

38:32.863 --> 38:34.983
You'll be dead before
your feet hit the ground.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.528
- Argh, God!
- Get in here!

38:37.529 --> 38:39.199
You'll get shot to pieces
out there, come here.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.542
Or cooked alive in here. Jesus Christ!

38:42.543 --> 38:45.062
But not us. No.

38:45.063 --> 38:48.182
We use that pain and that misery as fuel,

38:48.183 --> 38:52.622
and as a justification for our
obscene acts of inhumanity.

38:52.623 --> 38:56.182
- They're opening the back. Shit.
- The nuclear material.

38:56.183 --> 38:57.663
They can't get through that door.

39:06.536 --> 39:08.302
Jesus Christ!

39:08.303 --> 39:09.845
Shit!

39:11.543 --> 39:13.902
You don't know anything about me.

39:13.903 --> 39:17.102
I know that the British
government saw you as nothing.

39:17.103 --> 39:19.622
A pawn to be flicked off the table

39:19.623 --> 39:23.263
to let the more important
pieces remain in play, like me.

39:35.263 --> 39:37.822
Argh! Fuck!

39:37.823 --> 39:41.662
I know you didn't quit when your son died.

39:41.663 --> 39:43.903
You didn't even pause for reflection.

39:45.943 --> 39:48.263
No, no, no!

39:57.023 --> 39:58.796
Go, go, go!

40:11.023 --> 40:13.462
You don't get to talk about him.

40:13.463 --> 40:15.302
Not my Anthony.

40:15.303 --> 40:17.263
Not after what you did.

40:19.063 --> 40:21.023
You don't get to say that.

40:26.623 --> 40:29.422
Why didn't you walk away, huh?

40:29.423 --> 40:33.022
Huh? Any normal man would have.

40:33.023 --> 40:36.623
After the damage he saw that he
did to his wife, to his children.

40:39.023 --> 40:42.702
- Why did you keep going?
- I had a job to do. Ha, ha!

40:42.703 --> 40:45.342
Nah, cos you wanted revenge.

40:45.343 --> 40:46.982
With every pull of the trigger,

40:46.983 --> 40:49.262
there was some sense of justification,

40:49.263 --> 40:51.423
some sense of vindication.

40:52.823 --> 40:55.982
- I know who I am.
- And I know who I am.

40:55.983 --> 40:59.462
I am a soldier, and I have a mission.

40:59.463 --> 41:01.102
Where is Li-Na going?

41:01.103 --> 41:03.262
What does it matter now?

41:03.263 --> 41:06.223
I killed your son, you're not
going to let me walk out of here.

41:08.143 --> 41:12.783
Either way, I won't get to see it.
My greatest creation.

41:24.463 --> 41:26.903
You're not a murderer, Philip.

41:28.783 --> 41:30.703
But you're the exception.

41:32.583 --> 41:35.662
- You are the one I cross the line for.
- No, you're a good man.

41:35.663 --> 41:37.334
- You killed my son.
- No, you're a good man.

41:37.335 --> 41:39.543
You killed my son.

41:41.783 --> 41:44.423
- You killed my son.
- You're a good man.

42:18.403 --> 42:19.463
Boss.

42:22.423 --> 42:25.742
His papers. All his notes.

42:25.743 --> 42:28.662
His environmental considerations.

42:28.663 --> 42:33.102
Heat, time of year, indoors, outdoors.

42:33.103 --> 42:34.503
He was thorough.

42:38.903 --> 42:42.182
- Geneva.
- That's where he was researching.

42:42.183 --> 42:44.502
There are other considerations, but...

42:44.503 --> 42:46.423
You think this is where Li-Na's headed.

42:54.343 --> 42:56.502
I gave him the chance to talk.

42:56.503 --> 42:58.782
He wouldn't speak.

42:58.783 --> 43:00.582
We understand, boss.

43:00.583 --> 43:03.462
Oh, no. No, no, no.

43:03.463 --> 43:07.022
If you think a superior officer is
lying, then you call him out on it.

43:07.023 --> 43:11.022
Something doesn't ring true, never obey.

43:11.023 --> 43:12.751
Never blindly obey.

43:12.752 --> 43:16.503
- We said we understood, boss.
- We didn't say we believed you.

43:18.343 --> 43:21.782
So Li-Na's headed to Geneva
with a nuclear bomb.

43:21.783 --> 43:23.863
Straight to the United Nations.

43:43.108 --> 43:46.422
So whatever she's planning, this is it.

43:46.423 --> 43:48.423
This is where it ends.
