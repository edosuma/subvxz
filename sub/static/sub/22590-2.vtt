00:10.178 --> 00:16.184
<i>NARRATOR". Night, the cloak for sinners,
draws its dark folds over Gotham City...</i>

00:16.351 --> 00:20.104
<i>...where the Riddler hides out
in a little-used gymnasium.</i>

00:22.190 --> 00:24.526
Me? Throw the biggest fight
of my career tonight?

00:24.692 --> 00:27.779
- In Gotham Square Garden? I won't do it.
- Ah? Oh, yeah.

00:27.946 --> 00:31.533
- I won't go into the ring if the fight's fixed.
-Yes, you Will, Kid Gulliver.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.701
Yes, you will. Ha, ha.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.370
I have a riddle for you.

00:35.537 --> 00:41.834
What do many boats, shovels, laundries,
whistles and hot showers have in common?

00:42.126 --> 00:43.628
Steam.

00:43.795 --> 00:48.258
Put him in the steam room
and shrink him down to size.

00:51.469 --> 00:53.972
After Kid Gulliver, what, Riddler?

00:54.138 --> 00:58.059
Get rid of every other top prizefighter
in town, Betsy, that's what.

00:58.226 --> 01:01.813
Plus that contemptible crime-fighter,
Batman...

01:01.980 --> 01:05.316
...then control all the prizefighting
in Gotham City once and for all...

01:05.483 --> 01:06.693
...and everywhere else.

01:07.569 --> 01:09.654
That's a big order.
How are you gonna do it?

01:09.821 --> 01:14.242
With an ace I have up my sleeve,
and what an ace.

01:14.409 --> 01:15.660
But for starters...

01:15.827 --> 01:20.373
...when is the top of a mountain
like a savings account?

01:20.540 --> 01:21.791
Go on, Riddler.

01:24.377 --> 01:27.046
When it piques one's interest.

01:29.966 --> 01:33.094
Kid Gulliver?
Down for the count in the third?

01:33.261 --> 01:34.554
It's hard to believe, Bruce.

01:34.721 --> 01:36.848
As chairman
of Gotham City Boxing Commission...

01:37.015 --> 01:39.267
...I'm gonna call an emergency meeting.

01:39.434 --> 01:42.645
It looks like undesirable elements
have once again infiltrated...

01:42.812 --> 01:45.440
...the manly art of self-defense.

01:46.024 --> 01:50.153
<i>NARRATOR".
And making off with the box office receipts.</i>

01:56.492 --> 02:02.665
Riddle me this. When does a painter
use a trigger instead of a brush?

02:06.044 --> 02:08.795
When he's a stickup artist.

02:14.761 --> 02:18.473
- I'd like two seats for tomorrow's--
-That box, it's blinking.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.058
Help! Police! Help!

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:46.144 --> 03:48.730
And you caught no glimpse of the robbers,
Batgirl?

03:48.896 --> 03:52.525
No. I heard the cashier scream,
called Commissioner Gordon's office...

03:52.692 --> 03:54.986
...and brought this box directly here.

03:55.153 --> 03:58.990
It's lucky you were in the vicinity
of Gotham Square Garden.

03:59.157 --> 04:03.077
Yes. Luck is an important weapon
to a woman crime-fighter, Batman.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.079
Ah.

04:07.165 --> 04:08.666
As I suspected.

04:08.833 --> 04:13.671
This little blinking device is merely
an added touch to pique our curiosity.

04:13.838 --> 04:15.673
Sounds like a trick of Riddler's.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.507
Indeed. He's back.

04:17.675 --> 04:18.926
What's in the box?

04:19.093 --> 04:22.513
Apparently, just some...

04:22.680 --> 04:23.765
...metal filings.

04:24.682 --> 04:27.477
And this note.

04:28.978 --> 04:31.522
"Who rules the ring? No prince, king or raja.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.901
Look for a clue on the walls of Khafajah."

04:36.611 --> 04:38.863
Ah. Riddler, indeed.

04:39.030 --> 04:42.617
Returned to tease, taunt,
and torment us again.

04:43.367 --> 04:47.205
"Look for a clue on the walls of Khafajah."
What could he mean this time, Batman?

04:47.371 --> 04:50.708
Khafajah was a famous temple
in what was the land of Mesopotamia, Robin.

04:50.875 --> 04:54.712
My daughter, Barbara, studied the history
of Southwestern Asia in college, Batman.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.799
Perhaps if I called her,
she could be of some--

04:58.716 --> 05:00.218
What, uh...?

05:00.384 --> 05:03.679
What happened to Batgirl?

05:03.888 --> 05:06.599
- Begorra, she's gone.
- Into thin air.

05:06.766 --> 05:10.353
Her particular brand of vanishing cream...

05:10.520 --> 05:12.438
...another weapon in her arsenal.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.608
Commissioner Gordon.

05:15.775 --> 05:17.235
Yes?

05:17.777 --> 05:19.529
He what?

05:19.779 --> 05:21.614
Well, Batman's right here.

05:21.781 --> 05:23.908
I'll tell him at once.

05:24.075 --> 05:25.993
That was the boxing commissioner.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.580
He was-- He was calling about Kid Gulliver,
who's vanished.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.332
Disappeared completely...

05:31.499 --> 05:34.585
...while his seconds were carrying him
down to his dressing room.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.088
That shot I gave him
won't wear off for a week.

05:37.255 --> 05:39.966
- What was in that shot, boss?
-A little riddle juice, Kayo.

05:40.132 --> 05:45.179
Gentlemen, if we had our choice of laps
to sit on right now, which would we choose?

05:45.346 --> 05:46.639
Laps? To sit on?

05:46.806 --> 05:50.476
Kid Gulliver's temporary lapse of memory.
Take him away.

05:59.610 --> 06:03.823
Here are the burnooses, Riddler.
And my latest news break.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.284
"Mushy Nebuchadnezzer...

06:06.450 --> 06:09.704
...unchallenged champion
of Southwestern Asia's boxing world...

06:09.871 --> 06:11.956
...arrived in Gotham City tonight.

06:12.123 --> 06:16.252
Ready and willing
to take on any and all comers."

06:16.419 --> 06:20.214
Mushy Nebuchadnezzer?

06:21.257 --> 06:26.220
Stroke of your usual feminine genius, Betsy.

06:26.721 --> 06:30.850
Well, then slip into your burnoose, Riddler...

06:31.017 --> 06:37.148
...because Mushy Nebuchadnezzer is going
to appear on my midnight sports telecast.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.131
Sorry to bother you at this time of night,
Miss Gordon.

07:02.298 --> 07:05.343
We would've entered the building
by more conventional means...

07:05.509 --> 07:09.680
...but we didn't wanna startle the tenants.
-Oh, I understand. I was expecting you.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.474
- Oh?
-My father called.

07:11.641 --> 07:12.808
Won't you come in?

07:12.975 --> 07:14.602
- Thank you.
-You want to know...

07:14.769 --> 07:17.021
...about the famous temple of Khafajah?
-Yes.

07:17.521 --> 07:21.108
As I recall, some strange scrollwork
was found on the walls of that temple...

07:21.275 --> 07:23.152
...indicating men used fists to fight...

07:23.319 --> 07:27.031
...long before the supposed beginnings
of boxing in ancient Rome and Greece.

07:27.198 --> 07:29.951
Holy hieroglyphics.
How would the Riddler know that, Batman?

07:30.117 --> 07:34.664
The mind of a criminal like Riddler's is a sponge
which soaks up many strange facts, Robin.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.083
Riddler is an old archenemy of ours,
Miss Gordon...

07:37.249 --> 07:41.796
...returned to try to outwit us
and bilk the good citizens of Gotham City.

07:42.463 --> 07:46.884
That riddle he sent us,
perhaps we should examine it again.

07:47.051 --> 07:51.138
"Who rules the ring?
No prince, king or raja."

07:51.305 --> 07:53.724
Could he mean the prizefighting ring?

07:53.891 --> 07:57.853
We should've thought of that ourselves.
Up until tonight, Kid Gulliver was the champ.

07:58.020 --> 08:01.357
- Perhaps Riddler himself is trying to take over.
-That punctuated pipsqueak?

08:03.234 --> 08:04.777
Barbara. Barbara, it's I.

08:04.944 --> 08:06.737
It's my father.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.995
Well, tonight seems to be my night
for gentlemen callers.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.082
I was walking home, took a chance
the Caped Crusader would be here.

08:18.249 --> 08:21.419
Kid Gulliver's been found, Batman.
Outside Gotham Square Garden...

08:21.585 --> 08:23.087
...but he remembers nothing.

08:23.254 --> 08:26.924
Uh, an injection of some drug
seems to have affected his memory.

08:27.091 --> 08:29.593
Then it will do us no good
to talk to Kid Gulliver.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.264
We might take a look at Gotham Square
Garden. Maybe we'll find something.

08:33.431 --> 08:35.265
Thank you, Miss Gordon.
You've been great help.

08:35.433 --> 08:36.808
Batman.

08:38.269 --> 08:42.148
It's little enough to do
for so courageous a crime-fighter.

08:51.907 --> 08:55.953
I thought I'd catch the last
of Betsy Boldface's midnight sports telecast.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.664
Betsy Boldface
seems to have quite a hold over you.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.501
She's as good as any man
would be on that job.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.837
<i>- Mushy Nebuchadnezzer.
-Yes.</i>

09:05.004 --> 09:07.798
<i>Southwestern Asia's
unchallenged champion...</i>

09:07.965 --> 09:10.926
...and <i>also one of the most
colorful prizefighters in the world.</i>

09:11.093 --> 09:14.013
<i>For instance, Mushy, tell us,
just what do you eat?</i>

09:14.180 --> 09:18.809
<i>Tamarisk berries,
bulbul bird eggs and licorice.</i>

09:18.976 --> 09:22.146
<i>But, uh, only licorice native to my country.</i>

09:22.313 --> 09:24.523
<i>BETSY".
What liquids do you drink?</i>

09:24.690 --> 09:27.985
<i>Just, uh, camel grass juice.</i>

09:28.152 --> 09:29.862
<i>What else?</i>

09:32.073 --> 09:35.910
Enough of that. He sounds like
Southwestern Asia's unchallenged nut.

09:38.204 --> 09:42.666
<i>NARRATOR". While in the box office
of Gotham Square Garden...</i>

09:55.221 --> 09:56.722
We saw your car parked outside.

09:56.889 --> 10:00.893
Commissioner Gordon said
that you might be here looking around.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.354
All you all right, chief?

10:03.938 --> 10:05.648
What car? Who's Commissioner Gordon?

10:05.815 --> 10:08.109
Riddle me this, Dynamic Dullheads.

10:08.484 --> 10:10.194
What have the following in common?

10:10.361 --> 10:14.198
Hemming, basting, purling and tacking?

10:16.200 --> 10:18.160
Holy blackout.

10:18.327 --> 10:21.080
A unique trick of Riddler's.
Now you see him, now you don't.

10:21.247 --> 10:23.290
He's gotta be someplace in this building.

10:23.457 --> 10:26.127
Unfortunately,
we don't have time to go after him.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.045
Chief O'Hara needs help and quickly.

10:28.212 --> 10:32.466
Hemming and purling, basting and tacking
are all words related to needlework.

10:32.633 --> 10:36.470
You think they gave Chief O'Hara
the same injection as they gave Kid Gulliver?

10:36.637 --> 10:38.722
I'll take Chief O'Hara down to headquarters.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.267
You follow in the Batmobile.
Come, come, chief.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.395
You know something, Charlie...

10:44.562 --> 10:47.940
...all I could see under that burnoose
was Mushy Nebuchadnezzer's chin...

10:48.107 --> 10:52.611
...and it didn't look much like a Southwestern
Asiatic chin to this student of history.

10:52.778 --> 10:56.073
And there's something
about that Betsy Boldface.

10:56.323 --> 11:00.828
I'm afraid Batman and Robin are headed
for more than just Gotham Square Garden.

11:01.412 --> 11:05.624
Maybe Batgirl should investigate
the local source of tamarisk berries...

11:05.791 --> 11:09.545
...bulbul bird eggs, licorice,
and camel grass juice.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.887
<i>NARRATOR".
So it's across her bedroom in a flash...</i>

11:18.053 --> 11:19.930
<i>...to the secret Batgirl nook...</i>

11:20.097 --> 11:23.642
...where Barbara Gordon
<i>makes</i> her dazzling change...

11:23.809 --> 11:25.769
<i>...to Batgirl.</i>

11:27.313 --> 11:30.524
<i>And into action on her Batgirl Cycle.</i>

11:32.735 --> 11:37.656
<i>And shortly, back in Riddler's
little-used gymnasium.</i> ...

11:38.115 --> 11:41.952
I've picked up more than
Mushy Nebuchadnezzer's tamarisk berries...

11:42.119 --> 11:43.954
- Tamarisk?
-...and bulbul bird eggs...

11:44.121 --> 11:46.957
- Bulbul?
-...and licorice and camel grass juice...

11:47.124 --> 11:49.084
...at an Asiatic delicatessen.
-Ah.

11:49.251 --> 11:52.379
- Riddler, Batgirl is on my trail.
-Batgirl?

11:52.546 --> 11:53.714
Yes, Batgirl.

11:55.633 --> 11:57.801
I saw your phony broadcast tonight,
Riddler.

11:58.344 --> 12:01.972
Masquerading as Mushy Nebuchadnezzer.
What's your scheme?

12:02.139 --> 12:05.893
- What do you have up your sleeve this time?
-Up my sleeve, Batgirl?

12:06.060 --> 12:07.311
Riddle me once.

12:07.478 --> 12:10.481
What's most alluring,
when it's lowest or highest?

12:10.648 --> 12:13.567
When it's in the air or in a hole?

12:13.734 --> 12:18.822
When it's served you, yet you can't touch it?

12:20.407 --> 12:23.327
An enchanting ace.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.502
Put these earmuffs on.

12:33.462 --> 12:38.842
Siren, let her have
one of your most stunning notes.

13:08.998 --> 13:11.375
What happened?
It didn't work. It didn't work.

13:11.542 --> 13:15.963
Well, I've never tried my note two octaves
above high C on a woman before.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.591
- And she won't try it again.
-Get her.

13:22.928 --> 13:25.889
Good. Now, toss her into the steam room
as you did Kid Gulliver.

13:26.056 --> 13:31.061
Batgirls wilt just as quickly as other women.
Ha, ha.

13:36.734 --> 13:39.069
Like a dream.
It worked just like a dream, Betsy.

13:39.236 --> 13:43.073
I thought my broadcast would put
the Dynamic Decimal Points on your track.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.452
But Batgirl will work just as well.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.705
Even though Siren's stunning note
didn't work on her.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.875
But it didn't work on me, either.
I didn't have the earmuffs on.

13:53.042 --> 13:56.045
Well, it's never failed
to put men under my spell, Riddler.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.588
And at my command.

13:57.755 --> 14:00.883
Well, then men, you shall have. Three.

14:01.050 --> 14:04.261
Top prizefighters in the country
waiting outside right now...

14:04.428 --> 14:07.306
...to be dazed by your dazzling decibel.

14:07.473 --> 14:13.228
And with them in my power
and Batman KO'd once and for all...

14:13.395 --> 14:18.359
...I shall rule the ring.

14:21.862 --> 14:25.991
This is Jerry Quarry, Mushy.
A contender for the heavyweight title.

14:26.158 --> 14:30.829
Oh, yes. Jerry, contend with this.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.963
All right, Riddler, they're under my spell.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.965
They'll obey any order now.

14:42.132 --> 14:45.803
Good. Take them into the steam room.

14:49.473 --> 14:54.061
And turn the heat up
and find out how Batgirl is doing.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.983
Now. Now, to put Batman under my spell.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.986
I too have plans for Batman.

15:03.153 --> 15:06.323
- And Commissioner Gordon.
-A good parlay. A good parlay.

15:06.490 --> 15:10.911
Thank you, Siren,
from the bottom of my burnoose.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.837
- Batgirl's gone, boss.
-Gone? Gone?

15:20.003 --> 15:21.171
- Gone.
-No!

15:21.338 --> 15:23.048
- Somehow, she got out.
-No, no, no.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.509
- She must've went up a vent.
-No, no, no.

15:25.676 --> 15:29.847
- Would you like a shot of camel grass juice?
-No! No, no.

15:32.349 --> 15:37.813
Oh, what's looser than a thread, a fish,
flying ribbons?

15:37.980 --> 15:40.482
A woman's tongue.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.277
Possibly Batgirl's.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.697
I've got to get on some provocative riddles...

15:46.864 --> 15:52.035
...if I'm going to coax Batman into the ring
with Mushy Nebuchadnezzer.

15:53.871 --> 15:59.251
<i>NARRATOR". The next morning, Batman and
Robin reply to a summons on the red phone.</i>

16:01.170 --> 16:03.505
I have called Batman, Barbara.

16:03.672 --> 16:07.843
But I called you too because I needed
someone to talk to until he arrived.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.387
Oh, I know you'll be late at the library...

16:10.554 --> 16:14.850
...but with Chief O'Hara still in a state
of amnesia, I'm lost. That's all, just lost.

16:15.017 --> 16:18.437
The whole city is aroused
over Kid Gulliver's condition.

16:18.604 --> 16:21.482
Plus, the strange disappearances
of three of the contenders...

16:21.648 --> 16:23.609
...and I'm snowed under with riddles...

16:23.775 --> 16:27.779
...sent here to this office in care of Batman.
Listen to this nonsense.

16:27.946 --> 16:31.992
"What do bells, curtains, twins
and hair have in common?" Ha, ha.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.243
That's easy, Daddy.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.079
- Easy?
-Something like his riddle of last night:

16:36.246 --> 16:38.499
"Who rules the ring?"

16:38.665 --> 16:40.584
Uh, ring?

16:40.751 --> 16:43.045
Bells ring out. Curtains ring down.

16:43.212 --> 16:44.713
Twins are perfect ringers.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.050
- And hair often comes in ringlets.
-Well, smart girl.

16:48.217 --> 16:50.928
Yes. All right, then let's see you get this one.
Ahem.

16:51.094 --> 16:54.389
"Any aggressor
should beware his successor."

16:54.556 --> 16:58.602
Well, it isn't a very good rhyme, but it must
have something to do with Nebuchadnezzer.

16:58.769 --> 17:01.605
So he's still taunting Batman, eh?

17:01.772 --> 17:04.441
"Aggressor, successor." Ah.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.277
Sounds like a challenge to me.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.446
- Challenge?
-Yes, Batman.

17:10.614 --> 17:11.865
To meet Mushy in the ring.

17:13.951 --> 17:15.368
Commissioner Gordon.

17:15.536 --> 17:17.454
Yes, he's right here.

17:17.621 --> 17:20.123
This call's for you too.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.544
- Hello?
-Riddle me this, Batman.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.630
What are the chilliest 12 inches
in the world?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.298
It's the Riddler.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.635
The chilliest 12 inches in the world?
Cold feet.

17:31.802 --> 17:33.136
Excellent.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.014
What suit of cards lays eggs?

17:36.640 --> 17:40.310
One that's chickenhearted.
Now, listen to this, Riddler.

17:40.477 --> 17:44.690
<i>- Sticks and stones may break my bones--
-Now, you “stem to me, Batman.</i>

17:44.856 --> 17:49.403
My line is plugged into radio station GTCR.

17:49.570 --> 17:53.156
That means that all of Gotham City...

17:53.323 --> 17:57.995
...has heard you called, ha, ha, a coward.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.502
That's it, commissioner.

18:05.669 --> 18:08.755
Regardless of who Mushy Nebuchadnezzer
may be...

18:08.922 --> 18:12.134
...or what Riddler is up to,
regardless of private or public image...

18:12.301 --> 18:14.928
...one thing I cannot abide
is being called a coward.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.848
You may inform all the news media...

18:18.015 --> 18:21.018
...that I will meet
the champion of Southwestern Asia...

18:21.184 --> 18:23.437
...in Gotham Square Garden tonight.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.244
Phil, take over for a minute.
I'll be right back.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.376
You make an excellent second second,
Alfred.

18:46.543 --> 18:48.754
I trust no one will penetrate
my disguise, sir.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.798
- But I think perhaps you'd better call me Gus.
-Gus.

18:54.635 --> 18:58.430
Holy missing relatives. Look who's sitting
down behind Commissioner Gordon.

18:59.097 --> 19:02.267
Mrs. Cooper, how nice to see you.

19:02.434 --> 19:03.602
My daughter, Barbara.

19:03.769 --> 19:07.272
- Your daughter? How do you do, my dear?
-Hello.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.942
Oh, commissioner,
I've been such a wanderer.

19:11.109 --> 19:15.155
I just got back
from the New Hebrides this evening.

19:15.322 --> 19:19.242
I didn't want to let the boys know.
I wanted to surprise them.

19:19.409 --> 19:22.788
And there was nobody home,
not even Alfred.

19:22.954 --> 19:26.249
And then I heard that Batman was fighting...

19:26.416 --> 19:30.128
...this Mushy Nebuchadwhosis--
-Ha, ha.

19:30.295 --> 19:33.173
And you know me. I love a fight.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.597
As I thought, it's Riddler.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.266
This is ridiculous.
He's smaller than you are.

19:46.645 --> 19:48.063
Okay, fellas.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.359
I want a good, clean fight. Touch gloves.

19:52.526 --> 19:56.363
Batman, what eats crow, yells uncle,
and tosses sponges?

19:56.530 --> 19:59.282
- A loser. And I'm not a loser, Riddler.
-Oh?

20:15.132 --> 20:18.135
Spritz him, Riddler,
with the metal filings in your gloves.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.971
- Betsy's under the ring with a magnet.
-Go on, get him.

20:21.138 --> 20:23.724
- Stick it out, stick it out.
-Finish him off, come on.

20:27.853 --> 20:30.731
Wait, wait, wait. What--?

20:43.660 --> 20:45.537
Holy sudden incapacitation.

20:45.704 --> 20:46.788
Yes.

20:46.955 --> 20:50.709
The drawing power of this fight
seems to have concentrated beneath the ring.

20:51.501 --> 20:54.004
Aw, ha, ha. Ha-ha-ha!

20:55.505 --> 20:57.966
Mother Machree, what's happening?

20:58.133 --> 21:02.971
Batman's feet seem to be magnetized
to the canvas.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.182
Excuse me, I have something in my eye.

21:14.566 --> 21:17.360
<i>NARRATOR".
Through a door, as Barbara Gordon...</i>

21:17.527 --> 21:23.366
<i>...and seconds later,
making her startling reappearance as Batgirl.</i>

21:33.084 --> 21:37.172
- Batgirl.
-Yes, Betsy Boldface. We meet again.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.550
Ladies and gentlemen, riddle me this.

21:40.717 --> 21:44.304
When is a prizefight like a beautiful lady?

21:44.471 --> 21:48.725
Answer: when it's a knockout.

22:01.238 --> 22:03.740
Something went wrong.
Let's get out of here.

22:07.410 --> 22:10.247
- What happened to you?
-She happened to me.

22:10.413 --> 22:14.251
Get her. Batman's on our tail.
Let's get out through the steam room.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.957
- Any final riddles, Riddler?
-Yes.

22:54.124 --> 22:58.795
What do you throw away
that keeps returning?

22:59.379 --> 23:00.964
A boomerang.

23:01.131 --> 23:02.591
Correct.

23:02.757 --> 23:05.969
And I'm a boomerang.

23:06.136 --> 23:11.474
And I shall be back.

23:11.850 --> 23:15.687
Well, that winds that up, fellow crime-fighters.
Thanks to Batgir--

23:16.229 --> 23:19.316
- She's gone.
-Yes, but this time I saw where she went.

23:19.482 --> 23:22.861
Through that transom. And her
Batgirl Cycle's parked in the back alley.

23:23.028 --> 23:25.113
Let's follow her. Let's find out who she is.

23:25.280 --> 23:29.117
No, no, old churn. Let us respect
her disguise as she respects ours.

23:29.284 --> 23:32.996
- I guess you're right.
-Some camel grass juice, sir?

23:38.585 --> 23:41.504
Gosh, Batman,
this camel grass juice is great.

23:41.671 --> 23:44.758
Beware of strong stimulants, Robin.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.557
<i>- Yes, Bonnie.
- There's</i> a <i>Miss Circe out here...</i>

23:52.724 --> 23:54.059
<i>...to see you, commissioner.</i>

23:54.225 --> 23:55.518
<i>Lorelei Circe.</i>

23:55.685 --> 23:57.103
Circe?

23:57.270 --> 23:58.355
Circe.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.567
Name doesn't ring a bell, but send her in.

24:10.867 --> 24:14.037
Miss Circe, what can I do for you?

24:14.955 --> 24:20.710
It's what I can do for you, commissioner,
that really counts.

24:25.757 --> 24:30.887
<i>NARRATOR". Will the Siren succeed in the plan
she has for Batman and Commissioner Gordon?</i>

24:31.054 --> 24:33.598
<i>Will her purring parlay pay off?</i>

24:33.765 --> 24:37.894
<i>Watch for the stunning surprise
on the next episode.</i>
