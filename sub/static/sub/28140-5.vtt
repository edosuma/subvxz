00:08.840 --> 00:11.056
I thought I wouldn't see you again
unless you were in trouble.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.799
Oh, I am in trouble.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.479
Oh, you mean this kind of trouble?

00:14.560 --> 00:16.791
Isn't he great?

00:16.840 --> 00:17.910
He's so great.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.872
He's funny, he makes jokes.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.296
She turned around
and it was the golden one.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.136
You sort of needed to hear the top bit.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.197
I love wordplay.
- Oh, he's clever.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.516
Shakespeare uses wordplay.
- He says things like...

00:28.560 --> 00:31.359
I've got a big case tomorrow.
- He's little bit controlling...

00:31.400 --> 00:32.776
Don't eat that.
- But it's manageable.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
I'm going to.
- OK.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.439
He's a feminist.
- I have a sister.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.756
He's unpredictable.
- I'm just gonna go for a shit.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.950
I'm ignoring that.

00:39.840 --> 00:40.840
Actually...

00:41.240 --> 00:43.152
You wanna go and have sex?
- That's better.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.873
I'm really good at it.
- He won't be.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.679
I'm really good at it.
- He won't be.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.276
He's really good at it.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.070
Oh, my God...

00:58.240 --> 00:59.356
I'm not gonna be sick.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.196
I'm not gonna be sick.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.039
Hi.
- Hi.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.112
Uh, do you need a hand with any of...?

01:10.160 --> 01:11.958
No, no.
- I can at least take the bassoon...

01:12.000 --> 01:14.196
I am perfectly balanced, thank you.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.432
Big night last night?
- Is it obvious?

01:17.840 --> 01:19.560
Well, at least someone's having fun.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.136
- Wait, I can get the bell...
- No, no. I've got it.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.913
OK.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.159
Are you going to be sick?
- Nope.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.474
She better be quick today.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.951
I've got a serious appointment later.
I can't miss it.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.912
It's very important.
- What kind of appointment?

01:38.360 --> 01:40.636
A serious one. Can't miss it, OK?

01:40.960 --> 01:42.720
Well, do you need me to...
- I don't need you

01:42.920 --> 01:44.559
to do anything, thank you.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.629
Unless you can find a way

01:47.680 --> 01:49.876
to stop this horrendous wedding
from happening.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.149
Girls!
- Hi!

01:51.240 --> 01:52.594
Come in, come in. Oh.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.160
Oh, look.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.192
Just leave these things there for now, yeah?

01:56.320 --> 01:58.576
You like a quick cup of tea before you...
- Oh, actually, yeah.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.536
Um, I have to be pretty quick today.
- It's already in a pot.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.856
Some water, or some gin...
- Come through.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.270
We've got a tray of lovely,
sweet chocolate-y things

02:04.320 --> 02:06.710
and our lovely friend has just dropped round.
- Hi.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.190
Hello, darling.

02:09.759 --> 02:10.759
Hello.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.234
Uh, I'm gonna be sick.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.400
You alright? You look horrendous.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.113
Oh, thanks. Just a big night.

02:16.960 --> 02:17.960
Hello.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.880
Hey. I only meant to be quick, I wasn't...
Didn't need to...

02:20.920 --> 02:22.960
Wasn't expecting the whole family. Wow.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.640
They're being painted. Isn't that fun?
- Oh, so fun.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.116
Um, I can come back later?
- No, no.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.834
No. No.
- So, come on, fill us in.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.200
Probably better actually
that we should all hear the plans.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.470
- Right.
- Right.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.319
Well, I just wanted to pop in actually
to say that, um...

02:38.760 --> 02:41.673
I've been called away
this weekend and I'm afraid

02:41.720 --> 02:44.713
I won't be able to officiate
at the ceremony tomorrow.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.400
Oh, Christ.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.680
Why?

02:54.280 --> 02:55.680
My brother is ill.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.994
So I have to go and see him.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.112
Well, what's he ill with?

03:01.760 --> 03:02.760
A lorry.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.072
Accident.
- Right.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.120
Oh, God.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.479
Is he alright?
- He's... he's...

03:11.520 --> 03:14.752
he's in a bit of a state, to be honest.

03:15.680 --> 03:16.680
But, uh...

03:18.920 --> 03:20.149
I just can't do it.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.320
Can't do it.

03:23.720 --> 03:24.720
Well.

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
Well.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.639
Oh, this is gonna be spectacular.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.440
You...

03:35.480 --> 03:36.516
poor man.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.800
Well, of course you must go.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.473
Really?
- Uh, really?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.598
Of course. Family first.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.676
Always.

03:44.840 --> 03:45.956
Family first.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.352
You must go, get straight to him.
Just send me through the details

03:49.400 --> 03:51.576
of what you've worked out so far
and we'll sort something out.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.680
Oh, I've put out the feelers
for somebody else and...

03:53.720 --> 03:56.360
Well, uh, I think we might have to...
- Don't even think about it.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.357
This is much more important.
You must go.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.909
Go, go, go.
- OK. Well, thank you so much

04:00.960 --> 04:03.350
- for your understanding.
- Oh, well, sure, sure, sure.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.136
And all the best, and, uh,
I'll see you again. I'm sorry.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.416
- Oh, goodbye, darling.
- Have a great day.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.616
- Good luck.
- Bye, bye.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.397
What... a...

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
Cunt!

04:15.560 --> 04:17.200
- What a cunt!
- Look, don't, please...

04:17.240 --> 04:19.435
Bastard! Fucking ba...
Don't touch me!

04:19.640 --> 04:22.553
Christ, I need to paint! I need to paint now!
Send them away!

04:22.640 --> 04:23.640
I...

04:26.800 --> 04:28.917
I think you should, uh...
- Yes. OK.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.037
Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.793
Well, that solves that problem.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.674
Well, I'm relieved for him.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.876
You alright?
- Yeah, I'm just late for the café.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.239
Right.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.390
Oh, my God!
- Oh! Sorry.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.510
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.678
Jesus! How long were you there?
- Literally, three seconds.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.936
You can't just cancel a wedding.
- I don't have a choice.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.475
But you have the dress.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.239
I ca... I can't.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.936
I can't. I can't.
- Listen, I just need to say...

05:19.960 --> 05:21.296
No, no, I know what you're...
I don't want to know.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.080
I don't think you do know
what I'm gonna say.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.633
Please don't come to the church again.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.120
I mean that...

05:44.120 --> 05:45.679
with the greatest of compliments.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.080
I'd strongly advise
taking out the insurance.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.158
Er, the problem is...
- I can deal with it.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.696
The, um, er, if you took a seven foot tall...
- I can deal with it.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.633
A very large armchair, so he couldn't...
- Can't deal with it.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.990
...even feel the chinchilla, so, you know

06:16.040 --> 06:17.296
suffocating underneath him.
- Mm!

06:17.320 --> 06:18.436
It's Tuesday, Joe.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.471
No, it's Chatty Wednesday.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.477
No, it's Quiet Tuesday.
It's Chatty Wednesday.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.656
Well, it was a very small chinchilla...

06:25.680 --> 06:28.115
No, can we just stop chatting,
just for a second please, Joe?

06:30.440 --> 06:31.440
Joe, I...

06:38.440 --> 06:39.440
Hi.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.351
You OK?
- Uh, yeah.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.296
Are you OK?
You look like something bad's happened.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.755
Do I?
I thought I was looking jolly.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.237
Oh. Um, why?

06:49.480 --> 06:50.960
I've been offered a new job.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.430
Oh. Congratulations.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.116
Well, I just wanted to say goodbye.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.113
And to give you this.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Thanks.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.112
It's a guinea pig.
- It's a hamster.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.840
Thanks.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.480
Oh, sorry, it's my sister.
She's a bit mental. Do you mind if I...?

07:12.560 --> 07:14.438
Sure. I wasn't gonna stay, so...

07:14.480 --> 07:15.816
- Claire?
<i>- Something's happened.</i>

07:15.840 --> 07:17.638
<i>Something awful has happened.</i>

07:17.840 --> 07:19.638
What?
<i>- I can't...</i>

07:20.040 --> 07:22.216
Where are you? Do you need me to come?
<i>- I can't breathe.</i>

07:22.240 --> 07:24.038
<i>No, no, I just... I fucked it up!</i>

07:24.080 --> 07:26.595
<i>I fucked everything up! Can you come?</i>

07:26.640 --> 07:29.560
I mean, I have to close the café,
but I can... Just tell me where you are.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.195
<i>No, no, don't close.
I'm so sorry, but... but...</i>

07:32.240 --> 07:34.311
I-I can look after the place if you like.
- Really?

07:34.360 --> 07:35.714
Well, I don't start till Monday.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.920
Wait, why...?

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
I just like it.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.639
Well, OK...

07:39.640 --> 07:42.030
<i>Are you talking to me?</i>
- Could you give Hilary and, um...

07:42.080 --> 07:43.719
<i>No, don't bring Hilary.</i>
- Stephanie.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.917
...Stephanie,
some cucumber at 2:30?

07:45.960 --> 07:47.599
<i>Who's Stephanie?</i>
- Great, thanks.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.416
Um, Claire, just tell me where you are.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.840
What the hell has happened?
<i>- No, just come! I need you to...</i>

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
Tell the truth.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.433
It's horrendous.
- It's horrendous.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.153
It's modern.
- Don't lie!

08:01.200 --> 08:03.510
I'm not!
- I look like a pencil.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.035
You...

08:05.080 --> 08:06.799
you don't look like...
- Don't laugh!

08:07.000 --> 08:10.152
It's OK!
- It's not OK! I'm gonna lose my job.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.032
You won't lose your job. It's cool.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.839
It's not cool!
- It's edgy.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.599
Oh, fuck off!
- No, it's chic.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.672
It's unsalvageable!
- Claire, it's French.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.719
Really?
- Yes.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.516
Have you been drinking?

08:26.960 --> 08:30.510
Oh, he gave me champagne
before he ruined my life.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.070
That's how they get you.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.395
Did you go to Anthony?

08:35.840 --> 08:37.558
Claire.
- I know.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.068
What? You remember what happened to me?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.554
I honestly thought it was the last time
I was gonna see him.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.679
Um, I mean, that's awful, but if I...
- His little face was just...

08:45.720 --> 08:46.720
Anthony!

08:46.960 --> 08:49.350
Is this what you asked for?
- No, of course not.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.629
He's just a bastard.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Right, fuck it.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.440
What?
- Come on.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.678
No, no! It's alright!

08:58.720 --> 09:01.997
- Come on.
- Oh... slow down!

09:05.800 --> 09:06.800
Hey!

09:07.320 --> 09:08.390
No.
- Anthony.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.000
No! That is exactly what she asked for.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.157
No, it's not. We want compensation.
- Claire?

09:13.320 --> 09:16.279
I've got two important meetings
and I look like a pencil.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.556
No! Don't blame me for your bad choices.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.080
Hair isn't everything.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.400
Wow.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.640
What?

09:23.880 --> 09:25.917
Hair is everything.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.516
We wish it wasn't

09:27.600 --> 09:29.296
so we could actually think
about something else occasionally

09:29.320 --> 09:30.320
but it is.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.156
It's the difference between
a good day and a bad day.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.936
We're meant to think
that it's a symbol of power

09:34.960 --> 09:36.016
that it's a symbol of fertility.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.496
Some people are exploited for it
and it pays your fucking bills.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.432
Hair is everything, Anthony!

09:41.760 --> 09:43.274
Show her the reference.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.834
Claudia, bring me the bin.

10:02.680 --> 10:06.356
If you want to change your life,
change your life.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.754
It's not gonna happen in here.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.160
Sorry, Anthony.
- Sorry, Anthony.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.840
Didn't mean for it to turn out like that.
- I'll see you next week.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.396
You got any cigarettes?

10:17.600 --> 10:18.750
No.
- Good.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.996
Thank you for being there.
- It was cathartic.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.316
At the hospital.
- Oh, it's OK.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.590
Shame you didn't get to keep that doctor.
- Mm...

10:32.640 --> 10:33.756
I'm sorry you lost it.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.793
I just felt...

10:39.040 --> 10:40.076
relief.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.677
I didn't want my husband's baby.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.476
Isn't that awful?

10:52.320 --> 10:54.471
I haven't even asked you how you are.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.391
How are you? What's going on with you?

10:57.880 --> 11:00.554
Um... I met someone.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.834
What? Really?
- Yeah.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.276
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.320
What does he do?

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
He's a priest.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Is it...?

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
Yeah.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.673
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.114
You are joking.
- No.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.431
I'm sorry.
- I know.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.756
It's just...

11:40.880 --> 11:43.349
I'm sure it's very complicated.
- Yes.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.312
But it's just...
- It's very painful.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.233
You're a genius.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.600
You're my fucking hero.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.360
Claire?

11:51.120 --> 11:52.634
Is that you?
- Oh, God.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.109
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.475
Claire!
- Klare!

11:55.520 --> 11:57.159
Hi.
- Oh, my God!

11:57.200 --> 11:59.476
Claire, I love your hair!
- Oh!

11:59.520 --> 12:00.954
Claire!

12:01.000 --> 12:04.198
It's so cute and edgy and cool.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.312
Oh, thank you.
- Like superstar. Pop star.

12:09.320 --> 12:14.998
Listen, these penguins are taking me
to this new, amazing London music thing.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.320
Are you free?
- Oh.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.600
Yes.
- You wanna come?

12:18.440 --> 12:21.274
Oh, I... I have to take my step-son
his bassoon.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.118
I mean, I wish I could.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.520
Well, I leave tomorrow.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.080
So...
- Oh.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.238
I'll take the bassoon. I've got it.

12:31.880 --> 12:32.839
I'll take it.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.799
Oh, um, no, he's expecting me to.
- No, no.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.797
No, just tell Jake
it's with me at the café.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.910
Honestly, it's fine.
- Oh.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.469
Hey, I don't want to get in the way
of your family day.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.960
No, I'll take it.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.798
Please get in the way of her family days.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.840
Just tell Jake I've got it.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
No biggie.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.560
Bye, Claire.

12:51.880 --> 12:52.880
Bye, Klare.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.360
Bye, Claire.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.072
I can't believe your hair.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.431
It's so chic and cute.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.994
- It's all the things.
- Really?

13:04.920 --> 13:06.320
Goes so well with your top.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.159
Oh, thank God. That's so sweet of you.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.280
- Honestly, I've had such a day with it.
- Yeah, oh, right?

13:11.320 --> 13:12.993
Yeah.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.236
Oh, fuck.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.240
Sorry.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.119
Well, that was exhausting.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.797
The new guinea pig...
- Hamster.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.075
...is in with Hilary.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.633
They shared the cucumber, OK?
Which was quite sweet.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.034
Oh. Thanks.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.314
Well, I'd say anytime but, uh...
- You have a new job.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.120
I will be back, though.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.598
My wife would love Chatty Wednesdays.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.474
Love them.
- Oh.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.870
Ahem. Oh, you have a visitor.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.736
He said he knew you,
so I let him wait in there.

13:48.760 --> 13:49.760
Oh.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.800
Oh.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.800
Pleasure doing business with you.

13:55.720 --> 13:56.720
Bye.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.120
He took the pinny.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.914
Ugh.
- Hey!

14:08.440 --> 14:11.000
He's gonna make a bassoon joke.
- Is that a bassoon in your hand

14:11.040 --> 14:12.520
or are you just pleased to see me?

14:13.080 --> 14:14.434
Would you say that to your son?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.473
When he has his bassoon, sure.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.280
But...

14:18.320 --> 14:22.155
He's never pleased to see me, so...
- It doesn't even make sense.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.954
Why would a bassoon in my hand...
- Like a dick in your hand.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.816
Oh, right, so if I was walking towards you
with an amputated dick in my hand

14:27.840 --> 14:30.016
you'd think I was horny?
- Well, I'd assume that you had been.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.509
Certainly wouldn't put it
past you to chop a dick off.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.311
Put the guinea pig down.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.679
Where is she?
- Why?

14:38.360 --> 14:40.875
Well, she was meant
to have dropped that off

14:40.920 --> 14:43.216
and she's not at the office.
- Well, I don't know where she is.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.357
So you just... found that, huh?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.512
Mm. Please don't hurt the guinea pig.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.159
I would never hurt the guinea pig.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.200
I wouldn't do that.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.556
Here we go, sweetie. Go in here...

15:01.520 --> 15:03.000
Oh, that's fucking adorable.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.176
Are you sure we should even be talking?

15:05.200 --> 15:07.520
Aren't you supposed to be
getting me arrested or something?

15:07.960 --> 15:08.960
Wow.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.230
She really tells you everything,
doesn't she?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.430
Cute tables.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.710
Oh, Jesus, Martin.
- Fuck off!

15:22.920 --> 15:25.355
You... are the problem,
you know that?

15:25.400 --> 15:30.555
You are the problem
in my perfect, awful life.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.793
I haven't seen you in a year.

15:32.840 --> 15:37.357
And yet still, off she runs
into the night, for you.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.231
I can't even get the woman pregnant,
and then you come in

15:43.280 --> 15:45.511
showing off about your miscarriage.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.472
Like, you didn't even want
the one you had.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.429
I was just trying to make her feel better!

15:57.760 --> 15:58.760
Give me your phone.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.395
No.
- Give me your phone!

16:01.440 --> 16:02.440
No.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.150
Is she leaving me?

16:07.480 --> 16:08.516
I hope so.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.075
Don't let her leave me.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.153
Don't let her leave me, please.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.073
I hope she doesn't come home tonight.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.792
Ah! Cashmere, cashmere, cashmere...

16:31.200 --> 16:34.079
I will take you down, fucker.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.359
Fuck you!

16:38.360 --> 16:42.309
Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

16:42.480 --> 16:44.756
You better start sleeping with a lawyer!

16:44.800 --> 16:48.350
I'm already sleeping with a lawyer!
- Yeah? Lucky lawyer!

16:50.360 --> 16:51.794
Shit.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.519
I better call my lawyer.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.456
You know that feeling
when the Hot Misogynist

17:03.480 --> 17:05.175
who might not be a misogynist
is turning up at your house

17:05.200 --> 17:08.079
for the second time in 48 hours
to give you nine orgasms you don't want

17:08.119 --> 17:09.736
just to do something
to get your head out of the fact

17:09.760 --> 17:11.296
that the only person
you want to see in the world

17:11.319 --> 17:12.935
is the priest that you...

17:14.359 --> 17:16.480
So you pick yourself up,
cover yourself in coconut oil

17:16.520 --> 17:18.656
and hope he hasn't noticed
that you haven't shaved your...

17:18.680 --> 17:20.433
Hey.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.200
Your sister gave me your address.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.270
Are you on your way out?

17:29.280 --> 17:30.794
Oh, no, I just... I just got in.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.640
I've only got underwear under this coat.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.873
OK, good. Can I come in?

17:35.280 --> 17:36.555
Yeah. Sure.

17:42.840 --> 17:43.990
It's nice.
- Oh, thank you.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.880
Uh...

17:50.280 --> 17:52.954
Water?
- No, thanks. I wanna keep a clear head.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.838
Uh, I've changed my mind
about the wedding.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.240
I can't let them down like that.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.632
And apparently no one else
will wear the outfit.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.354
Oh, that's good of you.
- You gonna take off your coat?

18:03.400 --> 18:04.400
Oh...

18:04.520 --> 18:06.239
no, no, I'm good. I'm a bit chilly.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.149
I've sacrificed a lot for this life.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.197
You know?
I've given a lot of things up.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.479
Um, so, uh...

18:27.000 --> 18:28.150
Do you want to get that?

18:29.080 --> 18:31.675
Oh, no. I don't like opening the door
to people I don't know.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.871
I'm back!

18:35.560 --> 18:37.836
Look, if-if... if there's someone

18:37.880 --> 18:40.270
you need to see or-or let in, or...

18:40.320 --> 18:41.720
No, honestly, honestly, it's fine.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.790
When I was a child, I...

18:51.840 --> 18:53.456
- Little lady!
- I'm just...

18:53.480 --> 18:55.517
I'll just be, um...

18:58.640 --> 19:00.256
So, you're in trouble again, huh?

19:00.280 --> 19:03.512
Oh, my God, listen. You can't come in.
- OK, you wanna do it on the doorstep?

19:03.560 --> 19:06.678
Uh, no, my priest is here,
and he really needs some guidance.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.273
What? Is he OK?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.816
No, I'm hoping
he's having an emotional crisis.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.536
Shall I wait?
You said you wanted to see me.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.920
Yes, I did want to see you,
but now I don't want to see you.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.336
Did I do something wrong?
You seemed to like what I did.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.113
- I did.
- I'm really good at it.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.416
Yes, I know you are. Yeah.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.272
I'm really good at it.
- Yeah, I know you are.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.896
I'm really...
- OK, you're really good at it.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.296
Well, clearly I'm not, if you don't want it.
- Oh, for God's sake.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.755
You're the best sex I've ever had.
- What?

19:30.240 --> 19:32.436
You're the best sex I've ever had.
- Really?

19:32.880 --> 19:35.600
Honestly, you...
you made me come nine times.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.474
Honestly?

19:39.880 --> 19:42.111
Cool. Do you want me to go?

19:42.160 --> 19:43.435
Yeah. OK.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.040
I could take this somewhere else.
- Oh, OK, good. Good for her.

19:47.680 --> 19:48.680
Nine times.

19:48.960 --> 19:49.960
You're a saint.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.519
I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.715
That was...
- I won't ask.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.237
Nine times?
- I just had to get rid of him.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.320
Sure.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.351
I can't be physical with you.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.189
What, we can't even wrestle?

20:15.400 --> 20:18.598
No, priests have sex, you know.
A lot of them actually do.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.393
They don't burst into flames, I Googled it.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.235
I can't have sex with you
because I'll fall in love with you.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.794
And if I fall in love with you

20:25.840 --> 20:27.433
I won't burst into flames, but...

20:29.240 --> 20:30.469
my life will be fucked.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.275
We're gonna have sex.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.551
I'm supposed to love one thing.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.593
Oh, my God, we're gonna have sex.
- For fuck's sake! Stop that!

20:43.640 --> 20:45.616
I don't think you want to be told
what to do at all.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.176
I think you know exactly
what you want to do.

20:47.200 --> 20:50.096
If you really wanted to be told what to do,
you'd be wearing one of these.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.999
Women aren't actually allowed...
- Oh, fuck off! I know!

21:04.600 --> 21:05.954
We're gonna have sex, aren't we?

21:13.680 --> 21:14.680
Yeah.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.400
Yeah.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
OK.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.798
I...
- Oh, whoa, OK.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.913
Uh...
- Listen, I had a...

21:46.960 --> 21:48.792
No, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.
