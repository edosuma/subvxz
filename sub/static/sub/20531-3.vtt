WEBVTT

00:03.710 --> 00:04.960
So, right underneath our feet

00:04.960 --> 00:06.790
there are tunnels
and facilities?

00:06.790 --> 00:09.960
Miles, absolutely
miles of tunnels.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.970
It really is like something
out of a James Bond movie.

00:12.970 --> 00:15.260
NARRATOR:
Could a secret base in England

00:15.260 --> 00:19.010
hold evidence of
extraterrestrial visitation?

00:19.010 --> 00:21.560
NICK POPE: If there was anywhere
in the United Kingdom,

00:21.560 --> 00:23.640
any secret facility

00:23.640 --> 00:27.020
where crashed UFO debris
would have been brought,

00:27.020 --> 00:28.110
would've been right here.

00:30.940 --> 00:32.320
NARRATOR:
Is the British government

00:32.320 --> 00:35.700
in possession of
an alien spacecraft?

00:35.700 --> 00:37.700
POPE: The more I looked
into these claims,

00:37.700 --> 00:39.450
the more I realized,
"Wait a minute,

00:39.450 --> 00:41.370
there's something
going on here."

00:41.370 --> 00:43.710
NARRATOR: And did they even
develop one of their own?

00:43.710 --> 00:46.120
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
I had about five minutes,

00:46.120 --> 00:47.830
and then a police car showed up
and he said, "Well,

00:47.830 --> 00:49.250
I think it's time
for you to leave."

00:51.050 --> 00:52.970
♪ ♪

01:22.160 --> 01:24.620
NARRATOR:
London, England.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.290
2007.

01:27.290 --> 01:31.420
The British Ministry of Defence,
or MOD,

01:31.420 --> 01:34.720
makes a startling announcement.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.800
They are releasing the entirety
of their UFO files

01:38.800 --> 01:42.060
to the National Archives
of England.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.890
ANDREW RUSSELL: My belief
is that the MOD's motive

01:44.890 --> 01:50.020
was to have people
stop asking them questions.

01:50.020 --> 01:52.190
They could get away
from all these difficult

01:52.190 --> 01:53.860
Freedom of Information Act
requests

01:53.860 --> 01:55.190
that people were making.

01:55.190 --> 01:58.450
And they framed it in a way

01:58.450 --> 02:00.490
that it was all about
cost cutting.

02:00.490 --> 02:02.910
But in reality, it was almost
as if they just didn't want

02:02.910 --> 02:05.580
anything to do
with the subject anymore.

02:05.580 --> 02:09.330
I still believe they take a very
active interest in the subject,

02:09.330 --> 02:13.250
but they don't want to be seen
publicly to take that interest.

02:13.250 --> 02:17.220
NARRATOR: After a rollout
that took more than a decade,

02:17.220 --> 02:19.220
it came to light that
the Ministry of Defence

02:19.220 --> 02:23.350
had accumulated
over 60,000 documents

02:23.350 --> 02:26.430
pertaining to UFO encounters.

02:26.430 --> 02:30.650
But researchers sorting
through the archives

02:30.650 --> 02:35.530
were able to determine
that 18 key files were missing.

02:35.530 --> 02:40.320
RUSSELL: There were a number
of very famous cases

02:40.320 --> 02:43.740
where people have taken
some really good photos,

02:43.740 --> 02:47.120
some really good film imagery
that the MOD can't now find.

02:47.120 --> 02:52.960
Large parts of their files
were seemingly destroyed.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.880
And it seems
they have a very good,

02:54.880 --> 02:59.800
uh, history on losing really
important bits of information.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.680
NARRATOR:
After a request was submitted,

03:02.680 --> 03:06.930
Ministry of Defence officials
located the missing files.

03:06.930 --> 03:09.350
POPE:
Each file, by the way,

03:09.350 --> 03:12.600
contains upward of
maybe a hundred, 200 documents.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.940
So, we're talking thousands
of documents.

03:14.940 --> 03:18.900
They sent those files
to the National Archives

03:18.900 --> 03:22.820
and everyone was expecting
an imminent release.

03:22.820 --> 03:26.410
But in an unprecedented move,

03:26.410 --> 03:30.040
the Ministry of Defence
then recalled the files.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.790
Now, I've never heard
of this happening before.

03:32.790 --> 03:39.090
To date, these 18 files remain
under lock and key.

03:39.090 --> 03:42.340
So, something very mysterious
is going on.

03:42.340 --> 03:46.260
NARRATOR: Why would
the British Ministry of Defence

03:46.260 --> 03:50.270
send UFO files
to the National Archives

03:50.270 --> 03:54.310
and then suddenly recall them
without explanation?

03:54.310 --> 03:57.860
Some government insiders
have suggested

03:57.860 --> 04:00.940
that the files were moved
for safekeeping

04:00.940 --> 04:03.860
while another
even more secure facility

04:03.860 --> 04:05.910
was being prepared.

04:05.910 --> 04:09.160
When the National Archives
returned the files

04:09.160 --> 04:10.870
to the British government,

04:10.870 --> 04:14.670
they were spirited away
to an undisclosed location.

04:14.670 --> 04:18.590
There are those who believe
that location

04:18.590 --> 04:20.840
is a former Royal Air Force base

04:20.840 --> 04:23.220
in the southwest county
of Wiltshire,

04:23.220 --> 04:25.800
called Rudloe Manor,

04:25.800 --> 04:30.140
a site that
the Ministry of Defence

04:30.140 --> 04:32.890
used to perform
UFO investigations

04:32.890 --> 04:35.650
dating back to the 1940s.

04:37.940 --> 04:41.400
On the surface,
it appears to be nothing more

04:41.400 --> 04:44.110
than a quaint
English manor house.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.030
But deep beneath this structure

04:48.030 --> 04:51.240
lie an astounding
2.2 million square feet

04:51.240 --> 04:56.960
of vast caverns divided
into many smaller chambers.

04:56.960 --> 05:02.090
These underground quarries were
excavated in the 19th century

05:02.090 --> 05:04.470
to mine Bath stone,

05:04.470 --> 05:08.720
a type of limestone used to
build the nearby city of Bath

05:08.720 --> 05:12.600
and several other
English cities.

05:14.680 --> 05:18.730
One century later, in 1939,

05:18.730 --> 05:21.440
England was drawn
into World War II

05:21.440 --> 05:22.940
and the British Royal Air Force

05:22.940 --> 05:25.740
took over the depleted quarries,

05:25.740 --> 05:30.160
transforming them into
an underground aircraft factory.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.620
At the end of the war,
many such facilities

05:33.620 --> 05:35.660
were returned
to civilian control,

05:35.660 --> 05:39.790
but Rudloe Manor and
its over two million square feet

05:39.790 --> 05:43.130
of secret tunnels and chambers
were never surrendered.

05:43.130 --> 05:46.510
For years,
it was home to a group

05:46.510 --> 05:48.590
called the Provost
and Security Services.

05:48.590 --> 05:50.720
They're kind of like
the James Bonds

05:50.720 --> 05:52.470
of the British Royal Air Force.

05:52.470 --> 05:55.600
They do espionage
investigations,

05:55.600 --> 05:57.350
counterintelligence programs,

05:57.350 --> 06:01.190
things like that,
even terrorism investigations.

06:01.190 --> 06:05.990
But back in the 1990s
and certainly going back

06:05.990 --> 06:07.860
to the 1950s,

06:07.860 --> 06:09.530
the Provost and Security
Services

06:09.530 --> 06:13.660
were heavily involved
in UFO investigations.

06:13.660 --> 06:16.370
Now, for years, the Air Force
and the Ministry of Defence

06:16.370 --> 06:19.040
denied that any
UFO investigations

06:19.040 --> 06:20.540
were going on at Rudloe Manor.

06:20.540 --> 06:23.920
Then, a document got released

06:23.920 --> 06:25.960
and it showed
that actually, yes,

06:25.960 --> 06:30.340
UFO investigations had been done
from Rudloe Manor.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.720
And the staff there

06:32.720 --> 06:35.600
had been working
hand in glove with those of us

06:35.600 --> 06:38.350
in the headquarters building
in London.

06:38.350 --> 06:42.020
NARRATOR: Shortly before
the Ministry of Defence

06:42.020 --> 06:45.150
released their UFO files
in 2007,

06:45.150 --> 06:48.030
they announced that Rudloe Manor

06:48.030 --> 06:50.660
was no longer in use
by the military.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.660
But if that's true,
why are the grounds

06:53.660 --> 06:56.330
surrounded by chain‐link fences,

06:56.330 --> 06:58.910
monitored by security cameras,

06:58.910 --> 07:02.670
and even protected
by guard dogs?

07:02.670 --> 07:08.340
To find the answers,
in January of 2017,

07:08.340 --> 07:11.130
ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

07:11.130 --> 07:13.300
traveled to
the protected boundaries

07:13.300 --> 07:15.640
‐of Rudloe Manor.
‐POPE: There it is.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.470
NARRATOR: Joining him
in his search for the truth

07:17.470 --> 07:21.020
was Nick Pope,
who in the early 1990s,

07:21.020 --> 07:23.310
worked for
the Ministry of Defence

07:23.310 --> 07:25.360
investigating UFOs.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.860
TSOUKALOS:
We're here.

07:26.860 --> 07:30.110
During your time at the MOD,

07:30.110 --> 07:31.700
what did you learn
about this place

07:31.700 --> 07:34.740
or any type of, uh, UFO cases

07:34.740 --> 07:37.160
that may have happened
around this area?

07:37.160 --> 07:39.750
Well, this whole area is rich
in UFO sightings.

07:39.750 --> 07:45.040
Rudloe Manor was
the headquarters of a unit

07:45.040 --> 07:47.340
known as
Provost and Security Services.

07:47.340 --> 07:48.760
‐Mm.
‐Now, this is all tied up

07:48.760 --> 07:53.720
with Air Force security
and intelligence.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.810
UFO sightings were investigated
by staff

07:56.810 --> 07:58.520
based here at Rudloe Manor.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.350
But for years, we‐we denied it.

08:01.350 --> 08:04.650
We told Parliament, the media

08:04.650 --> 08:07.110
and the public that these things
were of no interest,

08:07.110 --> 08:10.240
that Rudloe Manor
had no involvement in this.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.820
And yet, when the files
were declassified,

08:12.820 --> 08:14.570
it turned out
that people were right.

08:14.570 --> 08:16.830
‐Right here?
‐Right here.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.040
‐Okay.
‐And‐and so, this‐this building

08:19.040 --> 08:24.170
really was at the heart of
Britain's secret UFO research

08:24.170 --> 08:26.000
and particularly, the
underground facilities below us.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.420
All sorts of secrets

08:30.420 --> 08:32.670
and research
and investigation projects

08:32.670 --> 08:36.550
went on from, uh,
this particular facility.

08:36.550 --> 08:40.770
NARRATOR: While the manor house
was the face of Rudloe Manor

08:40.770 --> 08:45.100
and the headquarters for
Britain's UFO investigations,

08:45.100 --> 08:47.650
access to
the underground facilities

08:47.650 --> 08:49.900
is found two miles away

08:49.900 --> 08:54.320
at the equally secretive
installation known as the C. C. C.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.410
POPE:
It's close to where we are.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.780
It's all part of
the underground facility,

08:59.780 --> 09:01.620
so there are tunnels

09:01.620 --> 09:04.500
which start right underneath
the manor house here

09:04.500 --> 09:07.000
and go to the C. C. C.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.920
No one knows exactly how many
people work down there,

09:08.920 --> 09:10.550
but it's thousands.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.710
‐Mm‐hmm. ‐Nobody knows
exactly what they do.

09:12.710 --> 09:14.670
And I worked for the government,

09:14.670 --> 09:17.550
for the Ministry of Defence
for 21 years and I don't know.

09:17.550 --> 09:19.640
‐Right. ‐So, and even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to tell you.

09:19.640 --> 09:20.970
Of course.

09:20.970 --> 09:23.930
NARRATOR:
Are the UFO files

09:23.930 --> 09:25.440
withheld by
the Ministry of Defence

09:25.440 --> 09:28.150
being kept at Rudloe Manor,

09:28.150 --> 09:31.230
as ancient astronaut theorists
believe?

09:31.230 --> 09:34.280
And could even greater secrets
be hidden

09:34.280 --> 09:38.700
at the mysterious site
known as the C. C. C.?

09:38.700 --> 09:43.580
POPE: Officially, it's called
the Corsham Computer Centre.

09:43.580 --> 09:47.580
And you can't get in there.
It's absolutely off‐limits.

09:47.580 --> 09:50.500
Whatever's going on down there,
it's big.

09:57.550 --> 09:58.840
NARRATOR:
Despite the fact

09:58.840 --> 10:01.510
that it is not open
to the public,

10:01.510 --> 10:05.730
ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

10:05.730 --> 10:07.390
asked Nick Pope
to take him to the C. C. C.

10:07.390 --> 10:10.440
for a firsthand look
at the installation.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.070
‐TSOUKALOS: All right.
‐Good luck.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.400
Thank you very much.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.900
NARRATOR:
As a former employee

10:14.900 --> 10:16.610
of the Ministry of Defence,

10:16.610 --> 10:18.450
Nick did not feel
it was appropriate

10:18.450 --> 10:21.870
for him to approach the facility
himself without clearance.

10:21.870 --> 10:23.030
I'll see you later, Nick.

10:23.030 --> 10:24.990
‐Yes.
‐Take care.

10:29.710 --> 10:33.840
TSOUKALOS:
Here we are. The C. C. C.

10:38.090 --> 10:40.220
The lights are on.

10:40.220 --> 10:44.600
And, uh, just like Nick
explained,

10:44.600 --> 10:48.850
it's got barbed wire, it is
fenced down, it's impenetrable.

10:48.850 --> 10:52.060
NARRATOR: According to the
British Ministry of Defence,

10:52.060 --> 10:56.030
the C. C. C. is simply
a data processing center

10:56.030 --> 10:57.190
for the Royal Navy.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.240
But if true,

10:59.240 --> 11:00.740
why is it so heavily guarded?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.870
TSOUKALOS:
Clearly, it's an access

11:04.870 --> 11:07.370
to what seems to be
an underground system.

11:07.370 --> 11:09.870
And if the stories that
Nick told me are true,

11:09.870 --> 11:12.830
then underneath our feet is
a vast system of tunnels

11:12.830 --> 11:14.130
and underground facilities.

11:14.130 --> 11:17.050
(siren blaring)

11:17.050 --> 11:18.840
NARRATOR: Within minutes
of Giorgio's arrival

11:18.840 --> 11:20.880
at the security gate,
the crew is met

11:20.880 --> 11:23.140
by a military police unit.

11:27.310 --> 11:28.890
TSOUKALOS: Can you tell me
anything about this place?

11:34.310 --> 11:37.070
NARRATOR: Unfortunately,
the situation ends

11:37.070 --> 11:39.030
with filming being halted.

11:39.030 --> 11:41.110
TSOUKALOS: Well, we're only
trying to find out the truth.

11:41.110 --> 11:43.030
NARRATOR:
But why?

11:43.030 --> 11:45.240
What is it that's so top secret

11:45.240 --> 11:48.830
that Giorgio and his camera crew
are not even allowed

11:48.830 --> 11:53.120
to film the entrance
from public property?

11:53.120 --> 11:55.590
TSOUKALOS: So it was exactly
how you said‐‐

11:55.590 --> 11:58.760
fortification,
barbed wire fence.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.590
I had about five minutes, and
then a police car showed up,

12:01.590 --> 12:04.430
and he said, "Well, I think
it's time for you to leave."

12:04.430 --> 12:07.060
Oh, I think you did exactly
the right thing to get out there

12:07.060 --> 12:08.890
while you could,
but you know that, uh,

12:08.890 --> 12:12.100
"A," it is operational, and "B,"
it's obviously important.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.440
They sent
the security people out.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.860
I‐I guarantee you
they had eyes on you

12:15.860 --> 12:17.610
from the moment you started.

12:17.610 --> 12:21.070
NARRATOR: Could this seemingly
innocuous building

12:21.070 --> 12:23.530
and the underground facilities
it leads to

12:23.530 --> 12:27.450
be continuing the
extraterrestrial investigations

12:27.450 --> 12:30.750
that were previously carried out
at Rudloe Manor?

12:30.750 --> 12:36.460
Ancient astronaut theorists say
yes and suggest that they are

12:36.460 --> 12:39.380
not only looking
into UFO reports

12:39.380 --> 12:42.550
but mysterious phenomena
that has been happening

12:42.550 --> 12:45.470
in the county of Wiltshire
for thousands of years.

12:48.010 --> 12:49.850
‐I think this is it right here.
‐Yes, here we are.

12:49.850 --> 12:51.560
‐Right.
‐Right.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.850
NARRATOR: Author and historian
Andrew Collins

12:54.850 --> 12:57.900
has lived in or near Wiltshire
for most of his life

12:57.900 --> 13:00.650
and has investigated
the many strange happenings

13:00.650 --> 13:02.280
associated with the area.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.400
‐How are you? You good?
‐All right. Yeah.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.450
NARRATOR: Giorgio and Nick
arranged to meet with him

13:06.450 --> 13:09.870
to discuss why
the Ministry of Defence

13:09.870 --> 13:12.250
might have chosen this location
to be the headquarters

13:12.250 --> 13:14.830
of their UFO investigations.

13:14.830 --> 13:18.040
You're looking
at the dead center

13:18.040 --> 13:21.800
of weird activity in the
whole of Great Britain.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.630
We've got UFOs...

13:25.630 --> 13:28.510
we've got crop circles,

13:28.510 --> 13:33.600
we've got the most intensive
amount of prehistoric sites,

13:33.600 --> 13:39.690
ancient mounds, burrows.

13:39.690 --> 13:43.940
Plus, we have, obviously,
the strange activity

13:43.940 --> 13:46.030
that surrounds places
like Rudloe Manor

13:46.030 --> 13:48.780
or Corsham as a whole,
where we are here today.

13:48.780 --> 13:51.700
Absolutely.
And some of these sites,

13:51.700 --> 13:53.370
I don't think people
realize, but they're older

13:53.370 --> 13:55.120
‐than the Egyptian pyramids.
‐Absolutely.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.500
COLLINS:
We've got here Stonehenge

13:59.500 --> 14:02.750
and Avebury itself.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.050
Most people think that
these sites go back

14:05.050 --> 14:08.300
4,500 to 5,000 years,

14:08.300 --> 14:11.850
but they in fact go back
at least 10,000 years.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.680
I lived in the center
of Avebury,

14:15.680 --> 14:18.230
which is the largest
stone‐circle complex

14:18.230 --> 14:19.520
in the whole of the world.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.190
UFOs have been seen,

14:23.190 --> 14:25.490
in the vicinity
of the stones there.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.700
Sometimes they've been seen
to actually

14:27.700 --> 14:30.950
come into the circle and land.

14:30.950 --> 14:34.580
Other times they have
manifested into strange shapes,

14:34.580 --> 14:37.460
figures, things like that.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.580
All around the country, there
are certain areas where UFOs

14:40.580 --> 14:43.250
manifest more than
anywhere else.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.920
They're called window areas,
and I believe that the area

14:46.920 --> 14:49.260
around Stonehenge and Avebury
is exactly

14:49.260 --> 14:51.140
one of those window areas.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.810
Because there are reports
of UFOs and strange lights

14:54.810 --> 14:58.480
being seen here for
several hundred years.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.110
And it's long been speculated
that there's a connection

15:02.110 --> 15:05.230
between UFOs and what
are known as "ley lines."

15:06.730 --> 15:08.780
NARRATOR:
In 1925,

15:08.780 --> 15:12.320
amateur archaeologist
Alfred Watkins published

15:12.320 --> 15:16.080
<i>The Old Straight Track,</i>
a book in which he proposed

15:16.080 --> 15:19.620
that man's earliest monuments
and megaliths were linked

15:19.620 --> 15:23.710
by a network of what he called
"ley lines."

15:23.710 --> 15:27.590
Some researchers claim
scientific testing shows

15:27.590 --> 15:31.010
evidence that the ley lines are
magnetic in nature,

15:31.010 --> 15:34.800
and delineate the lines of
Earth's unseen energy fields.

15:37.850 --> 15:40.390
I'm aware of at least
one ley line

15:40.390 --> 15:42.480
that goes all the way
from England

15:42.480 --> 15:46.980
to the bottom of the boot
in Italy in one straight line.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.900
And what's fascinating,

15:48.900 --> 15:51.400
that especially as it goes
through Italy,

15:51.400 --> 15:54.320
all these cities, they contain

15:54.320 --> 15:58.410
the root word for "star."

15:58.410 --> 16:01.540
We have what we call
the Earth grids.

16:01.540 --> 16:03.420
These are sites, power sites,

16:03.420 --> 16:05.540
all the way round the world,
which all seem to be

16:05.540 --> 16:08.960
linked by these lines of energy

16:08.960 --> 16:12.680
that seem to converge,
and at all of these sites

16:12.680 --> 16:14.930
you'll find the same type
of phenomena‐‐

16:14.930 --> 16:20.850
strange lights, UFOs,
mysterious happenings,

16:20.850 --> 16:25.860
prehistoric activity,
sacred sites.

16:25.860 --> 16:30.030
And this is exactly what
we have here in Wiltshire.

16:33.530 --> 16:36.280
NARRATOR: Could the so‐called
"ley lines" be part

16:36.280 --> 16:39.620
of an invisible energy grid?

16:39.620 --> 16:42.830
And might this explain
both the high number

16:42.830 --> 16:45.330
of mysterious occurrences
in this area,

16:45.330 --> 16:47.380
as well as the decision

16:47.380 --> 16:49.250
by the British Ministry
of Defence

16:49.250 --> 16:54.260
to base the headquarters for
their UFO investigations here?

16:54.260 --> 16:55.890
DAVID WILCOCK:
Why is the government there?

16:55.890 --> 16:57.350
What are they seeing?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.470
There are many compelling

16:59.470 --> 17:01.470
UFO sightings in Wiltshire

17:01.470 --> 17:04.520
that are jaw‐dropping in their
level of significance.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.730
WILCOCK:
As one example, in 1948,

17:08.730 --> 17:13.530
a couple was walking through
the fields of Wiltshire...

17:13.530 --> 17:17.410
and there in a low altitude
comes a flying saucer.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.910
They see two people
inside the ship,

17:22.910 --> 17:25.540
closely enough that
they could tell

17:25.540 --> 17:27.630
the people were looking
right at them.

17:27.630 --> 17:32.710
And this was in the immediate
aftermath of World War II.

17:32.710 --> 17:36.090
And remember,
now, after World War II,

17:36.090 --> 17:38.430
the British never gave back
the underground city

17:38.430 --> 17:41.180
below Rudloe Manor.

17:41.180 --> 17:44.430
And it could be that there are
unusual energies there

17:44.430 --> 17:47.980
at that exact spot where
the Ministry of Defence

17:47.980 --> 17:51.360
had the center of their UFO
investigating headquarters.

17:51.360 --> 17:54.650
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the Ministry of Defence

17:54.650 --> 17:59.070
retained control of Rudloe Manor
after World War II

17:59.070 --> 18:02.620
because they were aware that
extraterrestrials have been

18:02.620 --> 18:06.080
visiting the area of Wiltshire
not just in modern times

18:06.080 --> 18:09.080
but for thousands of years?

18:09.080 --> 18:12.130
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

18:12.130 --> 18:15.210
and suggest that further clues

18:15.210 --> 18:18.090
as to what is really going on
in the vast underground

18:18.090 --> 18:22.050
facilities can be found
by investigating an incident

18:22.050 --> 18:25.770
that has become known
as Britain's Roswell.

18:33.020 --> 18:35.030
NARRATOR:
London, England.

18:35.030 --> 18:38.240
May 22, 1955.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.990
In reports syndicated
by the INS,

18:41.990 --> 18:45.490
famed American newspaper
columnist Dorothy Kilgallen

18:45.490 --> 18:47.330
makes an audacious claim:

19:06.310 --> 19:09.810
Dorothy Kilgallen was someone
who had extremely good ties

19:09.810 --> 19:12.100
and links with people
in the government,

19:12.100 --> 19:14.610
the intelligence community,
and the military.

19:14.610 --> 19:17.990
Kilgallen heard a story
that she said

19:17.990 --> 19:20.070
came directly to her

19:20.070 --> 19:22.240
from a high‐ranking
representative

19:22.240 --> 19:23.410
of the British government.

19:23.410 --> 19:27.200
And the story was, back in '55,

19:27.200 --> 19:30.580
the British government had got
its hands on a crashed UFO.

19:30.580 --> 19:33.580
And judging from the size
of the craft

19:33.580 --> 19:38.170
and the interior of the vehicle,
it appeared to be piloted

19:38.170 --> 19:42.640
by very small,
humanoid‐like entities.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.850
Rather than stay quiet, Dorothy
Kilgallen obviously realized,

19:46.850 --> 19:51.520
given the source of the story,
this was a major breaking event.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.610
So she published this story
in the pages

19:54.610 --> 19:57.070
of a number of U. S. newspapers.

19:57.070 --> 20:01.200
NARRATOR: Could Dorothy
Kilgallen's story be true?

20:01.200 --> 20:05.780
For the next ten years,
she stood by her claims,

20:05.780 --> 20:08.330
insisting that further
investigations

20:08.330 --> 20:09.870
should be conducted.

20:09.870 --> 20:14.830
But on November 8, 1965,

20:14.830 --> 20:17.710
Dorothy Kilgallen died
under what some say

20:17.710 --> 20:21.170
were mysterious circumstances.

20:21.170 --> 20:24.090
While the British government
has never wavered

20:24.090 --> 20:27.140
in denying her allegations,

20:27.140 --> 20:30.310
UFO researcher and former
British Foreign Service

20:30.310 --> 20:33.520
officer Gordon Creighton claimed
to have found evidence

20:33.520 --> 20:35.980
that backed up her story.

20:35.980 --> 20:38.070
Gordon Creighton
looked into this case

20:38.070 --> 20:39.940
as deeply as possible,

20:39.940 --> 20:42.950
and his intelligence
connections suggested

20:42.950 --> 20:44.610
that the event had
actually occurred

20:44.610 --> 20:46.490
during the Second World War,

20:46.490 --> 20:49.950
and this crashed UFO was
put on ice, so to speak.

20:49.950 --> 20:51.700
And then, when the war was over

20:51.700 --> 20:54.500
and the peace was
reigning again,

20:54.500 --> 20:58.210
the military then decided
to pull this wrecked UFO

20:58.210 --> 21:02.300
out of the hangar and then
start investigating it.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.760
Now, a lot of the rumors
coming out about

21:05.760 --> 21:08.760
"the real investigations"

21:08.760 --> 21:11.350
are coming from Rudloe Manor.

21:11.350 --> 21:14.140
One of the more
thought‐provoking aspects

21:14.140 --> 21:16.440
of Rudloe Manor is this claim

21:16.440 --> 21:20.070
that it's sort of the
British equivalent of Area 51.

21:20.070 --> 21:23.440
NARRATOR: Interestingly,
this would not be the last time

21:23.440 --> 21:27.450
allegations surfaced that
a crashed UFO had been retrieved

21:27.450 --> 21:30.330
and taken to Rudloe Manor.

21:30.330 --> 21:35.870
Another, much more notorious
incident, occurred in the 1970s

21:35.870 --> 21:39.250
and was witnessed
by an entire village.

21:41.210 --> 21:44.220
Llandrillo, Wales,

21:44.220 --> 21:48.260
January 23, 1974.

21:48.260 --> 21:50.390
Late in the evening,

21:50.390 --> 21:53.350
this quiet rural village
in the Berwyn Mountains

21:53.350 --> 21:56.310
is rocked
by an enormous explosion.

21:58.480 --> 22:02.530
14‐year‐old Huw Lloyd is in
his home, watching television,

22:02.530 --> 22:05.070
when he feels the impact

22:05.070 --> 22:08.280
and then receives call
after call from his neighbors,

22:08.280 --> 22:11.870
most claiming to have seen
an incredibly bright light

22:11.870 --> 22:16.330
falling from the sky, and then
glowing on the mountainside.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.420
Today, Huw Lloyd still works

22:21.420 --> 22:23.550
on his father's ranch
in Llandrillo.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.920
‐Are you Huw?
‐Yep.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.670
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorist

22:26.670 --> 22:29.180
Giorgio Tsoukalos

22:29.180 --> 22:32.010
and Nick Pope,
a former UFO investigator

22:32.010 --> 22:33.510
for the British Ministry
of Defence,

22:33.510 --> 22:36.350
met up with Huw to get

22:36.350 --> 22:39.730
his take on what really happened
that night.

22:39.730 --> 22:41.360
‐Can you tell us
your experience? ‐Well...

23:09.380 --> 23:12.470
Your neighbors called you
to ask you if you're okay.

23:12.470 --> 23:15.010
So they pretty much
had similar experiences?

23:16.680 --> 23:17.680
So you're not the only one?

23:18.770 --> 23:20.600
And you were, uh, 14 years old?

23:22.560 --> 23:24.270
How did your parents react?

23:27.280 --> 23:29.360
And what time of evening
was this?

23:31.570 --> 23:34.030
So, you know,
some people have suggested

23:34.030 --> 23:36.370
that, why, it was nothing else
but an earthquake.

23:36.370 --> 23:38.080
‐Yeah. ‐Which I don't subscribe
to this idea,

23:38.080 --> 23:40.960
but have you had
any earthquakes around here?

23:52.510 --> 23:56.220
But you saw that light,
and it was much, much brighter

23:56.220 --> 23:58.770
than people lamping.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.890
I mean, it was something
almost blinding?

24:04.560 --> 24:05.400
Wow.

24:07.270 --> 24:10.110
NARRATOR: According
to ancient astronaut theorists,

24:10.110 --> 24:12.860
what really happened in the
Berwyn Mountains that night

24:12.860 --> 24:17.030
was the crash of
an extraterrestrial spacecraft

24:17.030 --> 24:20.790
that was retrieved
and taken to Rudloe Manor.

24:20.790 --> 24:24.960
And they suggest that the most
compelling clues can be found

24:24.960 --> 24:28.130
by examining
not the event itself

24:28.130 --> 24:31.720
but what happened
immediately after.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.510
(explosion,
electrical discharge)

24:37.390 --> 24:39.100
NARRATOR:
At 9:10 p. m.,

24:39.100 --> 24:44.230
on the night of the mysterious
incident at Llandrillo,

24:44.230 --> 24:46.690
approximately 30 minutes

24:46.690 --> 24:50.110
after the strange lights and
violent tremors were reported,

24:50.110 --> 24:54.280
a police officer arrived at the
home of eyewitness Huw Lloyd.

24:56.910 --> 25:00.490
There's a knock on the door, and
it was a police officer there.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.380
‐Right, so a senior officer.
‐Yeah.

25:10.380 --> 25:12.590
‐Not one of the local...
‐No.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.050
NARRATOR:
A plane crash?

25:19.050 --> 25:21.770
For Nick Pope, who worked
at the Ministry of Defence

25:21.770 --> 25:24.600
and has seen the file
on this incident,

25:24.600 --> 25:27.770
this is a surprising new detail.

25:27.770 --> 25:31.400
The official report
only mentions a meteor

25:31.400 --> 25:33.650
and nothing about a plane.

25:47.670 --> 25:50.960
Right, and roughly what time
did he turn up at the house?

25:54.090 --> 25:56.470
Right. So there is no way that
he could have got from Barmouth.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.430
Interesting. Okay.

26:01.430 --> 26:06.190
We've heard lots of stories
about military involvement,

26:06.190 --> 26:08.400
as well as police.

26:22.030 --> 26:25.160
The theory, initially,
that this was a plane crash

26:25.160 --> 26:28.120
and that this police
and military operation

26:28.120 --> 26:29.960
‐was a search and rescue...
‐Yeah.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.880
...or search and recovery,
that's fine.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.960
But I mean, you know,
we know where our planes are.

26:34.960 --> 26:39.130
There is 24‐7 radar coverage,

26:39.130 --> 26:41.100
‐civilian aircraft.
‐Even back then.

26:41.100 --> 26:45.140
Yeah, absolutely, planes don't
just drop out of the sky.

26:45.140 --> 26:47.730
And if they do, immediately,

26:47.730 --> 26:51.270
everyone knows which aircraft
it is, so it seems odd.

27:06.790 --> 27:09.000
NARRATOR: The officer
commandeered the family's truck

27:09.000 --> 27:11.500
and drove with Huw
to the crash site.

27:11.500 --> 27:15.800
Nick and Giorgio were taken
on the exact same journey

27:15.800 --> 27:17.880
that was made that night.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.720
POPE:
How high is the mountain?

27:23.890 --> 27:26.850
You know, one thing
that struck me is,

27:26.850 --> 27:28.930
this is
a pretty difficult drive.

27:28.930 --> 27:30.940
So you've got to be
pretty determined

27:30.940 --> 27:33.230
to get a whole bunch
of people up here.

27:33.230 --> 27:35.570
TSOUKALOS:
Yes, and for what purpose?

27:35.570 --> 27:38.990
Unless it's really something
of importance.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.780
‐Yeah, this is not to be
undertaken lightly, is it? ‐No.

27:41.780 --> 27:42.820
No.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.040
POPE:
An interesting thing

27:47.040 --> 27:50.580
is the fact that it was
an inspector who came out.

27:52.620 --> 27:55.500
‐Okay. ‐I mean, that's the
thing, you see, in the U. K.,

27:55.500 --> 27:58.300
most cops are constables,

27:58.300 --> 28:01.380
and then next up
from that is sergeant.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.470
And then inspector
is above that.

28:03.470 --> 28:06.600
‐Oh, really? ‐So it's actually
quite a senior rank.

28:06.600 --> 28:11.690
This, to me, says that somebody
somewhere was treating this

28:11.690 --> 28:14.100
as an important,
high‐profile incident

28:14.100 --> 28:16.610
that needed someone
with the seniority and the clout

28:16.610 --> 28:18.070
to deal with it.

28:18.070 --> 28:21.070
NARRATOR:
According to Huw,

28:21.070 --> 28:23.780
the police inspector directed
them to stop at this spot,

28:23.780 --> 28:27.240
although he was allegedly
not familiar with the area

28:27.240 --> 28:29.950
and seemed to have no reason
for doing so.

28:29.950 --> 28:32.660
It was at this location

28:32.660 --> 28:35.580
that he witnessed an incredibly
bright light in the distance.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.630
So, down there?

28:37.630 --> 28:39.550
‐Yeah, more to the left there,
okay? ‐Yeah.

28:46.140 --> 28:48.350
TSOUKALOS:
So not in the trees,

28:48.350 --> 28:51.180
but beyond... in the valley.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.320
TSOUKALOS:
When this light appeared,

28:59.320 --> 29:02.820
did it seem to you
as if it was an explosion?

29:07.570 --> 29:09.370
POPE: And how long
was it shining for?

29:14.250 --> 29:15.790
NARRATOR:
According to Huw,

29:15.790 --> 29:18.040
the inspector wanted
to get a closer look

29:18.040 --> 29:20.210
at the mysterious light

29:20.210 --> 29:24.550
but then received a curious
command from his superiors.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.820
So, it sounds like
it was a stand down call.

29:48.570 --> 29:50.120
TSOUKALOS:
Yes.

29:52.740 --> 29:56.540
NARRATOR: Curiously,
the official explanation

29:56.540 --> 29:59.840
for these events provided
by the Ministry of Defence

29:59.840 --> 30:03.880
did not include either
fox hunters or a plane crash,

30:03.880 --> 30:06.340
as was told to Huw that night.

30:06.340 --> 30:09.470
And the story they did provide

30:09.470 --> 30:13.140
involves
an incredible coincidence.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.850
The story is apparently

30:16.850 --> 30:20.020
that there was an earthquake
that hit the village.

30:20.020 --> 30:23.440
But at the same time,

30:23.440 --> 30:26.780
there was a bright
fireball meteor

30:26.780 --> 30:29.200
breaking up
in the Earth's atmosphere.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.910
So, not one extraordinary event,

30:32.910 --> 30:35.870
but two at exactly
the same time.

30:35.870 --> 30:40.000
Some people said,
"Has there been a UFO incident?

30:40.000 --> 30:44.170
Has there maybe been
a UFO crash?"

30:44.170 --> 30:48.840
Over the years, the UFO
community has become convinced

30:48.840 --> 30:52.100
that this was indeed
a UFO crash,

30:52.100 --> 30:55.770
that the military
launched a secret operation

30:55.770 --> 30:58.230
to secure the crash site,

30:58.230 --> 31:00.350
to recover the wreckage
and maybe bodies,

31:00.350 --> 31:03.940
and to take it
to a secure facility.

31:03.940 --> 31:08.110
And many believe that that
secure facility is Rudloe Manor.

31:08.110 --> 31:12.160
NARRATOR: If what Huw Lloyd
and hundreds of others witnessed

31:12.160 --> 31:15.080
on that night in 1974

31:15.080 --> 31:18.870
really was an alien craft
falling from the sky,

31:18.870 --> 31:20.750
might the wreckage
have been taken

31:20.750 --> 31:24.170
to Rudloe Manor
for investigation?

31:24.170 --> 31:27.510
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

31:27.510 --> 31:31.720
and suggest that perhaps the
most compelling evidence of all

31:31.720 --> 31:33.720
can be found by reexamining

31:33.720 --> 31:37.180
England's best‐documented
UFO encounter,

31:37.180 --> 31:40.600
the Rendlesham Forest incident.

31:47.860 --> 31:49.860
NARRATOR:
Rendlesham Forest.

31:49.860 --> 31:52.110
Suffolk County, England.

31:52.110 --> 31:55.450
200 miles east of Rudloe Manor

31:55.450 --> 31:58.160
lie six square miles
of woodlands

31:58.160 --> 32:00.500
that has become
notorious as the site

32:00.500 --> 32:04.210
of Great Britain's
most incredible UFO encounter.

32:04.210 --> 32:08.630
On December 26, 1980,

32:08.630 --> 32:11.170
near an air base leased
to the United States Air Force

32:11.170 --> 32:12.880
by the R. A. F.,

32:12.880 --> 32:16.390
strange lights are reported
on the horizon,

32:16.390 --> 32:20.520
in what appears to be
a possible downed aircraft.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.810
Two U. S. servicemen
are dispatched to the site.

32:24.810 --> 32:28.070
According to accounts,
radios failed

32:28.070 --> 32:29.730
as they approached
the targeted area,

32:29.730 --> 32:33.240
and the air itself
felt electrically charged

32:33.240 --> 32:35.120
as they closed in.

32:38.580 --> 32:42.660
Strange lights were seen
about 300 to 400 meters away

32:42.660 --> 32:45.540
from an area
that was called the East Gate.

32:45.540 --> 32:48.880
And the patrolling officers
at the East Gate

32:48.880 --> 32:51.210
saw the lights above the forest

32:51.210 --> 32:53.510
and they thought potentially
it was a downed aircraft

32:53.510 --> 32:55.640
or an aircraft in distress.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.260
So two of them,

32:57.260 --> 32:58.810
Sergeant Penniston
and Airman John Burroughs,

32:58.810 --> 33:01.470
went further into the forest.

33:01.470 --> 33:03.850
NARRATOR: Once at the so‐called
crash site,

33:03.850 --> 33:08.110
the men observed a strange
triangular craft on the ground,

33:08.110 --> 33:11.530
approximately three meters wide
at its base.

33:11.530 --> 33:16.280
POPE: It appeared to be either
hovering or on legs.

33:16.280 --> 33:21.330
And it had clearly come down
into this small clearing

33:21.330 --> 33:24.330
and smashed some of the branches
off the trees,

33:24.330 --> 33:28.170
so there was physical evidence
which was looked at afterwards.

33:28.170 --> 33:32.880
And so the men looked
at this strange object.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.760
PENNISTON: I noticed
that there was an inscription

33:34.760 --> 33:36.380
on the side of the aircraft.

33:36.380 --> 33:39.720
I was expecting to find,
I don't know, USAF,

33:39.720 --> 33:42.430
something like that.

33:42.430 --> 33:46.060
And what I find is glyphs,
pictorial glyphs,

33:46.060 --> 33:47.980
making no sense at all.

33:47.980 --> 33:50.270
And then I was running my hand
over the side of the craft;

33:50.270 --> 33:51.980
it was very warm to touch.

33:51.980 --> 33:54.360
At this time, we're getting

33:54.360 --> 33:57.450
a feeling of electricity
that was just bouncing.

33:57.450 --> 33:59.410
It was much, much stronger.

33:59.410 --> 34:01.950
There was this feeling
of being drawn into it,

34:01.950 --> 34:03.370
or being pulled into it.

34:03.370 --> 34:05.410
Like someone
was holding a picture

34:05.410 --> 34:09.830
of zeros and ones
in my mind's eye.

34:09.830 --> 34:13.170
NARRATOR: The strange visions
Sergeant Penniston had

34:13.170 --> 34:15.300
upon touching the craft

34:15.300 --> 34:19.930
has made this one of Britain's
most famous UFO encounters,

34:19.930 --> 34:23.270
but ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

34:23.270 --> 34:27.520
that even more compelling
is what happened after.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.400
(dispatcher speaking
indistinctly)

34:29.400 --> 34:30.810
NARRATOR:
The following evening,

34:30.810 --> 34:33.570
further strange sightings
occurred,

34:33.570 --> 34:36.440
and also the night after,

34:36.440 --> 34:40.200
reported by U. S. Air Force
Colonel Charles Halt.

34:40.200 --> 34:43.290
Colonel Halt
led his own search party

34:43.290 --> 34:46.660
to put an end to the confusion.

34:46.660 --> 34:49.710
But instead of finding
a logical explanation,

34:49.710 --> 34:52.540
they discovered
high levels of radioactivity

34:52.540 --> 34:54.750
where Burroughs and Penniston
had previously seen

34:54.750 --> 34:57.420
the strange craft,

34:57.420 --> 34:59.880
and three "impact holes"
in the ground.

35:02.260 --> 35:05.430
They then spotted
a light in a nearby field

35:05.430 --> 35:10.100
that suddenly came towards them
through the trees at high speed.

35:10.100 --> 35:13.900
One of the people with me said,
"Look there, to the north."

35:13.900 --> 35:16.400
There were four or five objects
in the sky.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.950
They were elliptical and round,
they changed shape.

35:19.950 --> 35:23.410
They moved at very high speed,
made sharp, angular turns,

35:23.410 --> 35:27.000
as though they were doing
some type of a grid search.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.790
One came at high speed,
and stopped directly overhead,

35:29.790 --> 35:31.880
3,000, 4,000, maybe 5,000 feet,

35:31.880 --> 35:33.960
and sent down
a concentrated beam

35:33.960 --> 35:35.550
about eight or ten feet from us.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.130
It was about a foot in diameter.

35:38.130 --> 35:41.430
I would describe it today
as probably like a laser beam.

35:41.430 --> 35:43.470
We noticed the other object
to the south

35:43.470 --> 35:46.430
sending down similar beams
on Woodbridge Base.

35:46.430 --> 35:47.930
Apparently, these beams were
falling down

35:47.930 --> 35:50.690
into or near
the weapons storage area.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.900
I was really concerned, then.

35:57.110 --> 36:00.450
HESELTINE: I suspect
it was some kind of scan

36:00.450 --> 36:04.910
to see what was inside,
the ordnance inside.

36:04.910 --> 36:07.580
What we do know
is Lieutenant Colonel Halt

36:07.580 --> 36:10.910
saw Colonel Williams
just a few hours later

36:10.910 --> 36:13.460
and told him
that beams had been shone down

36:13.460 --> 36:15.880
into the storage bunkers,
and he said,

36:15.880 --> 36:18.800
"I think the ordnance
needs to be checked out."

36:18.800 --> 36:22.010
NARRATOR: If Colonel Halt's
report is true,

36:22.010 --> 36:25.140
why were these craft
emitting beams of light

36:25.140 --> 36:27.310
down into the Woodbridge Base?

36:27.310 --> 36:30.890
According to some ancient
astronaut theorists,

36:30.890 --> 36:33.940
they may have been
conducting a search,

36:33.940 --> 36:38.780
not for nuclear weapons
but for one of their own craft.

36:38.780 --> 36:43.490
POPE: They were moving around
erratically,

36:43.490 --> 36:47.780
he said, as if... conducting
some sort of grid search,

36:47.780 --> 36:50.950
and the reason he said
that was that beams of lights

36:50.950 --> 36:53.750
were firing down from this UFO

36:53.750 --> 36:57.000
into one of the most
sensitive parts of the base,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.920
the weapons storage area.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.300
Maybe the aliens would be
looking for crashed UFOs,

37:03.300 --> 37:06.220
maybe their own alien technology

37:06.220 --> 37:09.510
to prevent us
from trying to back engineer it

37:09.510 --> 37:12.100
and build our own spacecraft.

37:14.850 --> 37:16.940
NARRATOR:
Could it be that the UFOs

37:16.940 --> 37:19.650
witnessed over the highly secure
Woodbridge Base

37:19.650 --> 37:24.400
were aliens searching for one
of their own downed craft?

37:24.400 --> 37:26.700
Might they have
considered this base

37:26.700 --> 37:28.530
the most likely place

37:28.530 --> 37:31.120
the British government
would hide such wreckage,

37:31.120 --> 37:33.710
unaware of its true location

37:33.710 --> 37:36.920
in the underground facilities
of Rudloe Manor?

37:36.920 --> 37:40.340
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

37:40.340 --> 37:44.050
the truth lies
within the 18 UFO files

37:44.050 --> 37:47.010
the British government
has withheld from the public,

37:47.010 --> 37:50.180
and that it might also exist
in documents

37:50.180 --> 37:53.600
recently declassified
by the CIA.

38:02.650 --> 38:04.610
NARRATOR:
Washington, D. C.

38:04.610 --> 38:08.280
October 2016.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.200
In the weeks leading up

38:10.200 --> 38:12.830
to the United States
presidential election,

38:12.830 --> 38:17.420
WikiLeaks publishes over 20,000
pages of private e‐mails

38:17.420 --> 38:19.540
belonging to John Podesta,

38:19.540 --> 38:23.420
the chairman
of Hillary Clinton's campaign.

38:23.420 --> 38:26.380
Within these e‐mails,
it is revealed

38:26.380 --> 38:28.890
that Podesta has
a strong interest

38:28.890 --> 38:32.390
in releasing the CIA's
classified UFO files

38:32.390 --> 38:35.730
should Clinton become president.

38:35.730 --> 38:39.020
While his candidate
lost the election,

38:39.020 --> 38:42.860
Podesta ultimately got his wish.

38:42.860 --> 38:47.570
On January 18, 2017,

38:47.570 --> 38:51.490
in Barack Obama's last days
as president,

38:51.490 --> 38:55.450
the CIA uploaded nearly
a million classified UFO files

38:55.450 --> 38:56.870
to its Web site.

38:56.870 --> 38:59.870
The move prompted new calls

38:59.870 --> 39:03.340
for the British government
to release the 18 files

39:03.340 --> 39:06.880
that they held back from their
own disclosure of UFO reports

39:06.880 --> 39:10.260
that began in 2007.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.470
But still,
the Ministry of Defence

39:12.470 --> 39:15.720
will not release
their documents.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.980
Could these files hold
information

39:17.980 --> 39:23.690
about extraterrestrial activity
not even known to the CIA?

39:23.690 --> 39:27.030
And do they remain hidden
at Rudloe Manor?

39:29.950 --> 39:31.570
I think the MOD is not willing

39:31.570 --> 39:33.740
to have that honest debate
with the public.

39:33.740 --> 39:36.790
It is not willing to, sort of,
open up its files.

39:36.790 --> 39:41.670
I don't think they trust
the people with information.

39:41.670 --> 39:43.790
They don't want
an informed populace.

39:43.790 --> 39:47.590
If you would get access to all
the information the MOD holds,

39:47.590 --> 39:49.170
I think it would point
to the fact

39:49.170 --> 39:51.090
that the MOD has
a lot of information

39:51.090 --> 39:54.390
that we're being visited
by extraterrestrial craft.

39:54.390 --> 40:00.100
WILCOCK: We now know that there
are at least two confirmed cases

40:00.100 --> 40:03.020
of crashed
extraterrestrial spacecraft

40:03.020 --> 40:05.770
being relocated to Rudloe Manor.

40:05.770 --> 40:09.900
This includes
Dorothy Kilgallen's claim

40:09.900 --> 40:12.700
that craft were crashing
in World War II

40:12.700 --> 40:14.370
and were brought
to Rudloe Manor,

40:14.370 --> 40:16.990
and it also includes
the Berwyn Mountains incident

40:16.990 --> 40:19.790
that occurred in 1974.

40:19.790 --> 40:23.290
The Ministry of Defence
vehemently denied

40:23.290 --> 40:26.130
that they were involved
in UFO investigations,

40:26.130 --> 40:28.880
and yet now, thanks
to declassified documents,

40:28.880 --> 40:30.800
we know that they were, in fact,

40:30.800 --> 40:33.380
actively investigating
this subject

40:33.380 --> 40:36.180
and that Rudloe Manor
was at the center of it.

40:36.180 --> 40:38.560
So now that we find out

40:38.560 --> 40:41.350
that even after they told us
they released all the documents,

40:41.350 --> 40:44.440
that there's 18 documents
being held back,

40:44.440 --> 40:48.610
something tells me that
when we go into those documents,

40:48.610 --> 40:53.200
we will find that all roads
lead back to Rudloe Manor.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.240
TSOUKALOS:
I think it's highly likely

40:56.240 --> 41:00.240
that they know that intelligent
extraterrestrial life exists.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.620
The only reason
why this information

41:03.620 --> 41:05.380
has not yet been made public

41:05.380 --> 41:08.960
is because
of this bizarre thought

41:08.960 --> 41:12.840
that we as a human species
can't handle the truth

41:12.840 --> 41:16.010
that we're not alone
in the universe.

41:16.010 --> 41:20.770
And I think that all government
agencies around the world

41:20.770 --> 41:23.310
should give the people
living on this planet

41:23.310 --> 41:25.310
a little bit more credit

41:25.310 --> 41:28.440
because it just shows
the greater picture

41:28.440 --> 41:32.110
and that we are part
of this larger picture.

41:35.030 --> 41:39.030
NARRATOR: Could the remains
of an extraterrestrial craft

41:39.030 --> 41:42.620
really lie hidden deep beneath
the surface of Rudloe Manor?

41:42.620 --> 41:45.160
And if so,

41:45.160 --> 41:49.040
might the recent disclosure
by the American CIA

41:49.040 --> 41:51.420
push the British government
closer

41:51.420 --> 41:54.670
to revealing
an incredible truth?

41:54.670 --> 41:58.720
Proof that first contact
with extraterrestrials

41:58.720 --> 42:01.760
is no longer the stuff
of science fiction,

42:01.760 --> 42:06.830
but of scientific
and historical fact.
