BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

00:12.345 --> 00:13.596
KILL HIM!

WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.067
CURIOUS?

00:26.151 --> 00:26.985

02:05.083 --> 02:06.084
Kill them.

02:06.751 --> 02:09.712
Kill them.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.173
You're all dead meat. Kill them.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.592
Kill them all!

02:15.927 --> 02:17.303
Kill them all.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.347
Die. Die!

02:21.683 --> 02:24.727
Let's kill them all.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.983
Great. Die. Come on, die.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.651
Die.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.862
All right. Let's kill them all.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.823
Get them all! Kill them!

02:37.740 --> 02:39.617
<i>Get out! If you don't, we're done!</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:45.331
It froze!

02:46.332 --> 02:47.458
Damn this slow computer.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.211
Sorry, guys.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.922
<i>Apple. Do us a favor
and get a new computer. Do it now.</i>

02:53.006 --> 02:54.549
<i>If we lose this, I'll kill myself.</i>

02:54.632 --> 02:56.050
<i>I've got no reason to live!</i>

02:56.134 --> 03:00.013
Melon. Just ignore the monster
and move in for the kill.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.723
Focus fire!

03:02.849 --> 03:03.892
Now.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.894
Now!

03:13.067 --> 03:14.360
We did it.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.489
We did it!

04:52.959 --> 04:55.920
Won-sik, keep working hard here.
Go get it!

I can do it!

05:14.605 --> 05:15.982
Why did he leave this here?

05:18.526 --> 05:20.153
<i>A lonely night</i>

05:21.404 --> 05:22.488
What's up?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.824
I forgot something.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.244
Where did it go?

05:33.291 --> 05:34.792
I put it aside for you.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.879
Thank you, Gyeong-su. I appreciate it.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.341
Right. My team leader is
taking us for octopus soup

05:42.425 --> 05:44.594
in Sangmi-dong later
to welcome me to the team.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.305
-I'm good.
-It's too gross for you, right?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.183
But you're coming, right?

05:50.850 --> 05:51.893
Can I?

05:52.685 --> 05:56.064
Even if we're on different teams,
we work for the same company.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.190
Of course you can.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.901
Hold on. I have to talk to him about work.

05:59.984 --> 06:03.196
Gyeong-su. How are things progressing
with Ms. Kim Chun-ja?

06:03.279 --> 06:04.655
Oh, that case…

06:04.739 --> 06:08.076
Team A is on that case now
since I was in charge of it.

06:08.659 --> 06:09.827
Now that I'm on Team A,

06:09.911 --> 06:12.580
the case was transferred to the team.

06:12.663 --> 06:13.998
-Mr. Kim!
-Coming!

06:24.175 --> 06:26.094
It's not because I find it gross.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.386
Pardon?

06:28.054 --> 06:30.056
I don't eat them because they're inhumane.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.643
Well, I think they're delicious.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.479
And it's good for young men like me too.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.526
What cases do we have left now?

06:46.447 --> 06:47.824
I don't want small cases.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.910
I want a case over 500 million won
that's going to make a mark.

06:52.036 --> 06:56.040
A lot of money is riding on this case,
but everyone is passing the buck for it,

06:56.707 --> 06:58.376
saying only an idiot would take it.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.545
REQUEST FOR INSPECTION
MEMBER NAME: KIM MIN-GYU

07:00.628 --> 07:02.046
EXPECTED PAYOUT: 1.2 BILLION WON

07:02.130 --> 07:04.048
Tell me the upside.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.052
Well, you know you're very competent.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.595
And I'm pretty smart too.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.932
So if we work on this together,
we might be able to do something.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.642
And objectively-speaking?

07:14.725 --> 07:18.521
This case is bad news. If it goes wrong,
we'll end up in trouble.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.233
The on-site inspection isn't even done.
How can the two of us do anything?

07:22.316 --> 07:24.026
We must have hope!

07:24.610 --> 07:27.447
I can do it. Let's be positive
and challenge ourselves.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.908
Oh Gyeong-su.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.831
Hometown, Daegu.
You have three older sisters.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.666
Your father runs a <i>gochujang</i> factory.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.960
You weren't fit enough
for Police University.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.963
Two years on the job,
a good memory, good presentations,

07:44.046 --> 07:46.507
-and a fan of the Samsung Lions.
-What's going on?

07:47.091 --> 07:51.512
Do you know how you stacked up
against your year's batch of new recruits?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.515
I heard that I was at the top.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.058
You were at the bottom.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.978
You didn't look loyal
or serious about the job.

07:59.061 --> 08:02.440
Actually, the way they put it
was harsher than this.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.110
So who do you think made
such an evaluation?

08:11.782 --> 08:13.326
How do you think you got the job?

08:13.993 --> 08:17.997
Who do you think saw your potential?

08:22.251 --> 08:23.169
It was me.

08:24.795 --> 08:29.467
I saw it. The fire within you.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.468
It's hot!

08:31.344 --> 08:33.721
See? I can feel it.

08:33.804 --> 08:37.475
If people like you put their mind to it,
they can pull anything off.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.394
"Fire"?

08:42.772 --> 08:45.107
Look. 1.2 billion won rests on this case.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.862
If you pull this off, you'll get
your promotion way faster than Won-sik.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.740
You get it, right?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.576
Yes. I got it.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.789
But how are we going
to solve this one by ourselves?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.917
We'll need a mercenary.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.629
I got it.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.508
Let's go.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.009
<i>-We're there. Go!</i>
-Let's go!

09:12.093 --> 09:14.136
You're dead!

09:21.269 --> 09:24.355
I turned off the power of computers
while people are playing games.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.314
-What?
-Hey!

09:25.398 --> 09:28.526
<i>-Come on!
-What are you doing?</i>

09:28.609 --> 09:29.694
Die!

09:32.196 --> 09:33.364
<i>No.</i>

09:34.073 --> 09:35.408
<i>No!</i>

09:35.491 --> 09:40.997
KOO, 43 YEARS OLD, HWAGUK-DONG

09:41.080 --> 09:42.623
No…

09:52.425 --> 09:54.844
You…

09:54.927 --> 09:57.597
You!

09:57.680 --> 09:59.765
You!

10:10.901 --> 10:11.986
Gosh.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.087
What would you like?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.804
What would you like to order?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.435
Pardon? I can't hear you.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.442
A bowl of udon, <i>yakisoba</i>,

10:53.069 --> 10:55.237
-and dumplings too.
-Okay. I got it.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.955
Kyung-yi.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.427
-A glass of draft beer too, please.
-You got it.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.223
Kyung-yi. Let's talk about work now.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.519
One of our clients went missing.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.783
It happened in Tongyeong.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.285
His name is Kim Min-gyu.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.704
A 35-year-old office worker
at a chemical plant.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.164
Here's your beer.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.171
Enjoy.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.354
He went out for a morning walk
and never came back.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.608
His wife reported him missing.
And he was recently presumed dead.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.861
His wife, Yoon Jae-yeong,
is the beneficiary.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.948
They aren't locals, but everyone knows
they were as happy as parakeets.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.492
They also have a daughter.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.097
Did you know
parakeets are actually parrots?

13:28.265 --> 13:30.434
They have nothing to do
with happy marriages.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.982
And I don't trust
those so-called happy couples.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.527
How would people know if they were happy?

13:39.610 --> 13:42.238
The couple went out of their way
to put on a show.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.281
You still doubt everything.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.535
But I think
they really were happy together.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.378
-The husband was such a family man.
-Look over there.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.172
Were there cameras at his house?
How would you know that?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.132
-Don't interrupt.
-How about a photo?

14:02.216 --> 14:03.092
<i>-Hi.
-Hi.</i>

14:03.175 --> 14:05.177
<i>-One, two, three.
-Hi.</i>

14:08.889 --> 14:13.310
I believe in our Almighty Father,
the creator of heaven and earth.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.145
<i>The couple went to church diligently</i>

14:15.229 --> 14:17.356
<i>-and was well-liked too.</i>
-It's hot. Be careful.

14:17.856 --> 14:20.234
<i>There was a low mountain
around their house…</i>

14:20.317 --> 14:22.027
-Dad, here!
-…so he often hiked there.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.154
Nothing stood out
on the day he went missing.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.407
He wore his usual hiking outfit.

14:27.032 --> 14:30.286
<i>The person you have reached is
unavailable. You'll be directed to…</i>

14:30.369 --> 14:32.162
<i>-Mr. Kim!
-Mr. Kim!</i>

14:32.246 --> 14:34.415
<i>But he disappeared without a trace.</i>

14:34.498 --> 14:36.083
-Mr. Kim!
-Mr. Kim!

14:37.376 --> 14:39.461
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim!

14:39.545 --> 14:41.881
<i>-But they found his blood…</i>
-We found something!

14:41.964 --> 14:44.008
<i>…and the bag he took that day at a cliff.</i>

14:44.091 --> 14:45.718
<i>And his shoes were in the water.</i>

14:46.260 --> 14:47.553
Keep searching.

14:47.636 --> 14:48.679
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.807
<i>They didn't find his body,
but there was no sign that he survived.</i>

14:52.474 --> 14:54.518
-My husband went missing.
-His wife didn't give up

14:54.602 --> 14:55.853
and kept looking for him.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.646
-She went at it for a while.
-Take a look, please.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.398
Hello. Take a look, please.

14:59.481 --> 15:03.485
I'M LOOKING FOR MY MISSING HUSBAND

15:18.500 --> 15:21.712
They took out a loan to buy a house.
But no loans from private lenders.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.589
They didn't have money problems.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.175
Other than their daughter's
hospital bills for diabetes.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.012
Excuse me. Here's your order.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.270
Enjoy.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.570
I see.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.907
"I see"? That's all you got?

15:50.532 --> 15:51.742
You said no interruptions.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.494
Nothing comes to your mind?

15:53.577 --> 15:56.664
That you're as dense as always.

15:58.707 --> 16:01.377
And that you still can't hide
your real intention.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.670
What intention?

16:06.256 --> 16:08.258
You want me to turn it into
a suicide case.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.719
Right? Like he had some problem

16:10.803 --> 16:13.764
or his marriage was falling apart.
You want me to find some stuff

16:13.847 --> 16:15.182
and spread the word.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.519
Since the company isn't obligated
to make a payout

16:18.602 --> 16:21.981
if he's been diagnosed with depression
and this turns out to be suicide.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.401
It's quite dirty,
but you don't feel guilty at all, do you?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.820
We don't fabricate documents.

16:28.612 --> 16:29.780
And I'll say this again.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.116
See me and the company
as separate entities.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.661
Seeing how you're upset,
you do feel guilty.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.705
I pushed your buttons.

16:39.623 --> 16:43.127
I'm not asking you to fabricate anything.
Just get me circumstantial evidence.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.753
How can this not be suicide?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.755
How can you be so sure?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.590
You just said something was off.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.343
You can never tell with people.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.680
They may seem fine, but they could've
killed themselves because--

17:12.197 --> 17:13.115
That's tough.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.412
You'll take the case, right?

17:18.495 --> 17:22.041
You barge in and throw me a case
when you can't handle it.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.168
I'm not your errand runner.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.128
It's not like you pay me well either.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.213
And where do I have to go? Tongyeong?

17:28.297 --> 17:29.798
Gosh. That's too far.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.593
You should take care of this case
on your own.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.182
Do they do takeouts here
for the dumplings?

17:38.265 --> 17:39.224
No.

17:41.643 --> 17:42.686
No takeouts?

17:43.270 --> 17:46.899
I meant that you will have no choice
but to take this case.

18:00.788 --> 18:01.705
What are you doing?

18:02.414 --> 18:04.708
I haven't been out for so long,
so I forgot.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.514
You know too much about me.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.518
Goodness.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.980
MESSI FORCE RTX 3080 TI GRAPHIC CARD,
ORSAI T3 RUSH GRAY/CHARCOAL

18:27.064 --> 18:28.524
BEN MOCIUZ EX2710,
ORSAI VIRTUOSO RGB WIRELESS SE

18:42.871 --> 18:45.624
<i>Hello. I'm Oh Gyeong-su
of Investigation Team B from NT--</i>

19:22.744 --> 19:27.207
I know too much about you.
And I know exactly what you need as well.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.459
This is Gyeong-su from my--

19:30.878 --> 19:33.881
That's from Switzerland.
You can't force it open.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.552
If you want to open it,
just take the case.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.310
You must think I'm a joke.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.479
I can just buy all this with my own money.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.647
Gyeong-su.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.567
Ms. Koo,
you have 350,000 won in Hyeonyeong Bank

19:53.650 --> 19:56.236
and 1,090,000 won in Daehan Bank.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.197
I rounded them down.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.075
I had more than I thought.

20:02.159 --> 20:05.370
It cost 1.1 million won for the cleaners
and to dispose of the trash.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.748
-After that…
-I didn't ask you to clean the house.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.708
Take it all back.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.960
And where's my computer?

20:13.503 --> 20:17.090
I'm not sure
if we can call that a computer.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.551
Gosh. When will we finish all this?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.136
Hey.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.402
Cockroaches!

20:39.112 --> 20:40.697
But this isn't right.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.741
You're forcing this on me.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.452
I feel like my freedom
has utterly been infringed.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.288
If you think I'll take the case
for this computer,

20:48.372 --> 20:50.332
you must be out of your…

21:21.613 --> 21:22.781
Gosh. Look at this.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.702
This is awesome. Isn't it?

21:28.203 --> 21:31.123
Did my eyesight get better?

21:33.083 --> 21:34.209
It's so bright.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.297
If you don't take the case,
I'll return this.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.927
Was it Tongyeong?

21:44.886 --> 21:48.265
It's getting late.
Go home. It's getting hot here.

21:52.060 --> 21:52.978
INVITED SANTA AND MELONMUSK TO THE PARTY

21:53.061 --> 21:55.564
Guys, I got a new computer!

21:55.647 --> 21:57.691
It won't freeze now. It's amazing!

22:00.569 --> 22:02.612
Gyeong-su will come
and pick you up tomorrow.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.114
Okay. Sure.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.825
That's way too soon though.
Come next week.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.830
Wait. He's coming?

22:13.040 --> 22:14.958
I can't work with someone I can't trust.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.918
Can you even drive?

22:17.002 --> 22:18.962
You even forgot your passcode.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.715
Do you remember
which side the accelerator is on?

22:23.425 --> 22:26.470
Driving is all about instincts.
Anyway, I won't work with him.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.059
Who are you?

22:33.977 --> 22:36.688
I think I introduced myself several times.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.648
Not your job title.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.317
Who are you?

22:43.779 --> 22:46.198
From your accent, you must be from Daegu.

22:46.281 --> 22:47.824
You tried to become a cop, right?

22:48.617 --> 22:50.202
I bet it was your physical test.

22:50.285 --> 22:53.080
You're not the type to work
for someone like Je-hui.

22:53.163 --> 22:56.249
It's suspicious that
you still haven't left her team.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.879
Are you trying to take credit
for her work,

23:00.962 --> 23:02.798
move teams, and get promoted?

23:04.883 --> 23:08.929
I don't think I can work with someone
as rude and unhygienic as her.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.605
Are you serious?

23:18.688 --> 23:20.482
-That's it. I'll return it.
-Come on.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.110
We just need a driver, right?

23:23.193 --> 23:25.028
I can find someone trustworthy.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.447
Is there anyone you can trust?

23:27.531 --> 23:29.407
I'm very busy, Kyung-yi.

23:36.623 --> 23:39.251
DOES ANYONE WANT A PART-TIME JOB
AS A DRIVER?

23:41.128 --> 23:42.254
<i>I don't have a license.</i>

23:42.921 --> 23:44.631
<i>Nice. I'll take it.</i>

23:44.714 --> 23:46.133
Are you okay starting tomorrow?

23:49.970 --> 23:51.012
I got myself a driver.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.682
Are you kidding me?

23:54.349 --> 23:58.478
You trust some stranger online
over my college who I vouch for?

24:02.566 --> 24:03.692
He's not a stranger.

24:03.775 --> 24:06.820
We've been
in thousands of battles together.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.197
I can count on him to have my back!

24:15.662 --> 24:18.832
Well, we will provide you with a vehicle.

24:19.416 --> 24:23.044
You'll be hired as a temp,
driving for NT Life Insurance.

24:24.504 --> 24:29.134
Inspector Koo Kyung-yi isn't the type
to get along with others.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.469
You must know that firsthand.

24:34.055 --> 24:37.058
By the way, may I ask you
about your work experiences?

24:50.614 --> 24:52.574
He's totally not what I pictured.

24:53.074 --> 24:54.659
You're a good judge of character.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.871
He used to be a caregiver
but he's playing games to blow off steam.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.751
He's totally not what I pictured.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.253
Are you sure he's Santa from my team?

25:05.337 --> 25:06.880
Maybe he's someone else.

25:06.963 --> 25:09.007
Okay. What did he say?

25:09.549 --> 25:13.011
"When everyone on our team died
and I had only five HP,

25:13.094 --> 25:15.931
I hid, then landed a counterattack
to wipe the other team out."

25:16.014 --> 25:18.350
He calls it
"the Battle of Liberation Day."

25:18.433 --> 25:19.935
He said you'd believe him then.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.812
THE BATTLE OF LIBERATION DAY

25:22.896 --> 25:23.897
That's him.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.200
Let's go. Hurry.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.161
Hurry.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.789
Be careful.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.670
All right. Great driving skills, check.

25:46.753 --> 25:49.047
Then please take care of this case.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.265
Wake me up when we get there.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.100
Please.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.313
"To be, or not to be,
that is the question.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.816
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

26:07.899 --> 26:10.860
to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune."

26:11.403 --> 26:13.154
"The fair Ophelia!

26:13.238 --> 26:15.782
Nymph, in thy orisons
be all my sins remembered."

26:15.865 --> 26:19.452
"My lord. How does
your honor for this many a day?"

26:19.536 --> 26:22.247
Hey, we're so good. I think we're ready.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.456
Thank you so much.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.166
Horang.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.877
Horang, where are you?

26:27.961 --> 26:29.170
Chunsam.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.549
Bonggu. Myeongtae.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.634
The youngest one is Roy.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.136
Roy.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.388
Hey, what's that?

26:38.972 --> 26:40.348
Has it always been here?

26:40.432 --> 26:42.183
It says it belongs to Yeong-ju.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.644
Who could have sent it?

26:45.228 --> 26:46.938
Come take a look. I'm scared.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.691
-This is creepy.
-Hurry and open it.

26:50.734 --> 26:51.776
I'm scared.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.574
FOR YEONG-JU

27:03.580 --> 27:05.165
Is that you, Kyung?

27:06.041 --> 27:07.292
-What?
-How did you do it?

27:07.375 --> 27:09.794
-It's a surprise.
-Is it a special day today?

27:11.296 --> 27:12.630
Yeong-ju's birthday?

27:12.714 --> 27:14.883
-No way.
-Is it your birthday today?

27:14.966 --> 27:17.552
-Why didn't you tell us?
-It's not my birthday.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.095
How adorable!

27:19.179 --> 27:21.264
-They're so cute.
-So adorable.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.432
What are you doing?

27:22.515 --> 27:24.559
-Hello.
-Hello.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.227
It smells here. Open the windows.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.980
BONGBAEK GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
DRAMA CLUB

27:29.064 --> 27:30.523
They're so cute!

27:30.607 --> 27:32.150
How are they so cute?

27:33.193 --> 27:34.778
They're so adorable.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.368
Hey, your face is bleeding.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.331
Roy scratched me
while I was putting on the ribbon.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.041
You really got me.

27:48.124 --> 27:51.169
Really? You said you like surprises.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.797
Totally. I thought
my heart was going to stop.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.466
Whatever you're doing,

27:56.549 --> 27:58.426
you should stop and start practicing.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.095
Let me just take one more photo.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.222
Take one for me too.

28:13.817 --> 28:14.818
Come on. Do it.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.319
No.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.410
-What a nice day.
-Yes, indeed.

28:24.494 --> 28:25.787
We're sightseeing.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.836
-Bye. Yes.
-You're leaving?

28:42.303 --> 28:44.431
She'll just think it got lost.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.266
Put the rest back in.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.031
Next.

29:04.826 --> 29:07.245
-Bye.
-Hello.

29:08.663 --> 29:10.457
-It's been a while.
-Right.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.624
-How's the new house?
-Good.

29:13.042 --> 29:16.212
It's weird that
only her counter has a long queue.

29:17.547 --> 29:18.923
Something is fishy.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.888
I don't think you can return this.

29:31.936 --> 29:32.771
AI VOICE

29:32.854 --> 29:35.106
EDIT MESSAGE

29:38.985 --> 29:40.779
Even I would line up at her counter.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.823
Green onions? What are you making?

29:43.907 --> 29:46.117
-I'll make a salad.
-Really? Sounds delicious.

29:46.743 --> 29:47.786
Bye.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.621
Do you think she's a good person?

30:01.466 --> 30:04.427
She's still driving the used car
her husband bought.

30:04.511 --> 30:08.264
She won't be able to cover
the maintenance fee for her car,

30:08.348 --> 30:11.226
her daughter's medical bills
and tuition with her paycheck.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.980
With the insurance payout,
she would be okay.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.066
Right?

30:20.318 --> 30:21.694
Did you buy what I asked?

30:58.648 --> 31:01.568
You can't park your car like that.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.485
DANGER, NO PARKING

31:02.569 --> 31:04.988
Where are you from? Are you a tourist?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.117
<i>You want to buy a house?</i>

31:09.200 --> 31:12.412
<i>I've been here 40 years, born and raised.
Ask me anything.</i>

31:13.079 --> 31:16.249
<i>I like this town.
It's a perfectly sized fishing town.</i>

31:16.332 --> 31:18.001
But is it safe?

31:18.084 --> 31:20.253
I heard someone went missing here.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.462
What?

31:21.546 --> 31:24.090
I heard a married man who moved here
had gone missing.

31:24.173 --> 31:28.428
Oh, that? That's not what happened.
It was unfortunate what happened to them.

31:28.511 --> 31:32.473
Nothing dangerous
has ever happened here for decades.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.310
I see. I get it.

31:35.393 --> 31:39.522
It must be because there's
a competent detective like you here.

31:39.606 --> 31:42.233
Goodness.
You are a good judge of character.

31:44.527 --> 31:48.072
By the way, how were they unfortunate?

31:49.198 --> 31:52.285
Things were tough for the couple
because their daughter had diabetes,

31:52.368 --> 31:53.578
but he was very diligent.

31:53.661 --> 31:56.205
But he made a false step while hiking.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.624
That was unfortunate.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.292
We couldn't even find his body.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.086
Oh, no.

32:03.254 --> 32:07.425
Maybe he took his own life because he was
heartbroken for his sick daughter.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.719
No way. Other people might have,

32:09.802 --> 32:13.056
but he wouldn't do something like that
to his beloved wife.

32:13.139 --> 32:16.267
The plant he worked at
had a few job openings.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.561
So he made good money.
Why would he do that?

32:19.145 --> 32:22.398
Come on. You never know what really
goes on inside other people's heads

32:22.482 --> 32:23.983
no matter how close you are.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.778
I bet that you don't know
what your wife is thinking either.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.322
Goodness. That's a sore spot with him.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.699
It's hard to believe,
but he's never been married.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.160
Goodness.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.163
I knew it.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.958
Gosh. Look at him blushing.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.542
Hey, be quiet.

32:43.044 --> 32:46.381
So a lot of people quit
their jobs at the plant, right?

32:46.464 --> 32:48.174
Is it because they moved to the city?

32:48.257 --> 32:51.177
That's not it. They all died.

32:51.260 --> 32:53.137
-They died?
-Come on.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.390
That's no way to welcome
a visitor to our town.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.604
Thanks.

33:03.606 --> 33:04.691
What about me?

33:10.238 --> 33:11.698
Over the past two years,

33:11.781 --> 33:15.410
workers from the plant Min-gyu worked at
died one after another.

33:15.493 --> 33:20.456
That's why we suspected
that something had happened to him too.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.959
Gosh. That's scary.

33:23.584 --> 33:25.086
Was it some contagious disease?

33:25.169 --> 33:27.463
Let's see.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.841
One of them died in a car accident.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.801
One of them died of a heart attack.

33:31.884 --> 33:34.554
Come on. I thought you were fishing here.

33:34.637 --> 33:36.723
Stop gossiping in front of the visitors.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.225
Everyone knows about it,
why keep it a secret?

33:39.308 --> 33:42.937
People from the same plant died
one after another?

33:47.775 --> 33:49.444
Something is fishy.

33:56.075 --> 33:58.411
<i>-What can wash away my sin?
-What can wash away my sin?</i>

33:58.494 --> 34:02.457
<i>-Nothing but the blood of Jesus
-Nothing but the blood of Jesus</i>

34:02.540 --> 34:06.627
<i>-What can make me whole again?
-What can make me whole again?</i>

34:06.711 --> 34:10.673
<i>-Nothing but the blood of Jesus
-Nothing but the blood of Jesus</i>

34:10.757 --> 34:14.886

OUR STORIES OF THE MONTH

34:49.170 --> 34:51.672
THERE WAS A FUNNY MAN ON TV

34:51.756 --> 34:53.216
KIM SEON-MI

34:56.677 --> 34:58.763
<i>RAINBOW</i>
RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE…

34:58.846 --> 35:00.890
I DREW MY DAD I MET IN MY DREAM

35:00.973 --> 35:05.144
<i>Last night, my dad</i>

35:05.812 --> 35:10.024
<i>Came home with a big smile</i>

35:10.817 --> 35:15.196
<i>And crayons in his hand</i>

35:15.738 --> 35:19.700
<i>He bought crayons for me</i>

35:22.370 --> 35:24.372
This is Sister Yoon Jae-yeong.

35:25.873 --> 35:28.084
What's your name?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.002
I'm Kim Seon-mi.

35:30.878 --> 35:34.006
I wanted you two to meet
since you may be in the same boat.

35:34.590 --> 35:36.092
I guess it was meant to be.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.470
What do you mean?

35:39.554 --> 35:43.266
Her daughter is also named Kim Seon-mi.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.893
Gosh. Really?

35:46.686 --> 35:49.897
The Lord must have brought us together.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.609
I'm Kim Seon-mi.

AN OFFICE WORKER IN HIS FORTIES
DIES OF HEART ATTACK IN TONGYEONG

35:56.195 --> 35:57.655
A CAR ACCIDENT RESULTS IN 2 DEATHS
AT AN UNDERPASS IN TONGYEONG

OBITUARY NOTICE
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

36:02.535 --> 36:03.703
HAN MAN-GU OF HYOCHANG BIO

36:03.786 --> 36:05.371
A WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES COMMITS SUICIDE

36:05.454 --> 36:06.998
NO SUICIDE NOTE HAS BEEN FOUND

36:12.003 --> 36:16.090
But what do their deaths
have to do with Kim Min-gyu's case?

36:17.717 --> 36:20.553
She's suspicious of many things,
but she's usually right.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.515
I'm doing it because you asked me to,

36:25.266 --> 36:27.810
but I don't feel good about that woman.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.270
I heard some weird rumors too.

36:29.353 --> 36:30.396
Rumors?

36:30.479 --> 36:32.690
Like biting a client who came in
to file a complaint?

36:32.773 --> 36:35.026
They definitely deserved it.

36:35.109 --> 36:38.237
But there are other rumors
that are worse than that.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.156
That she killed her husband?

36:40.740 --> 36:41.824
Is that true?

36:42.408 --> 36:44.493
We can always learn something
even from rumors.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.622
Then it's true?

36:47.705 --> 36:49.665
How tragic is my life?

36:50.583 --> 36:52.543
I lost my husband out of the blue.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.926
But those people
from the insurance company

37:00.009 --> 37:03.012
looked at me as if I killed my husband

37:03.095 --> 37:04.889
and kept asking me questions.

37:06.140 --> 37:09.227
I wanted to give up everything,
including the insurance payout.

37:13.147 --> 37:16.400
But then, I heard God.

37:17.401 --> 37:19.779
"My daughter, do not give up.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.531
It's not just any money.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.368
It's a present from your husband.

37:25.451 --> 37:28.454
And it's a present from me."

37:33.626 --> 37:35.711
You too should never give up, Sister.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.714
The insurance company will bring up money

37:38.798 --> 37:41.050
and ask you questions to break you down.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.636
But don't let them find out

37:44.178 --> 37:46.764
that your husband was
depressed or acting strange

37:46.847 --> 37:48.432
before the accident.

38:01.737 --> 38:05.658
We have a duty to serve God.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.787
-I…
-Yes.

38:10.871 --> 38:11.956
Yes.

38:13.249 --> 38:16.877
We should talk about our hardships
and put them behind us.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.300
I'm all right.

38:28.347 --> 38:31.100
Do you think your husband went to heaven?

38:32.184 --> 38:33.060
Pardon?

38:33.644 --> 38:35.563
I sometimes wonder

38:36.314 --> 38:39.400
if my husband went to heaven or hell.

38:41.235 --> 38:44.530
If he was the man I knew,
he would've ended up in heaven.

38:45.197 --> 38:48.451
But I wonder
if he was really who I thought he was.

38:50.369 --> 38:53.873
What if I live a good life
and go to heaven,

38:54.874 --> 38:56.459
but he's in hell?

38:58.002 --> 38:59.295
What do I do then?

39:03.466 --> 39:04.383
I…

39:06.969 --> 39:09.013
I don't believe my husband is dead.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.725
What are you talking about?

39:13.351 --> 39:16.354
If I could, I'd wait for him.

39:17.104 --> 39:20.149
He would never
throw away his life like that.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.111
But working all day won't be enough
for me to pay the bills

39:24.779 --> 39:26.906
if my daughter
has to go to a big hospital.

39:27.656 --> 39:30.451
So even if people criticize me
for living off the payout,

39:31.160 --> 39:32.953
I'm putting my daughter first.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.628
I'm sorry. I have to go to work.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.934
-Oh, no.
-No!

39:57.269 --> 39:58.354
What on earth is that?

39:58.437 --> 40:00.940
-No!
-How can this be?

40:01.023 --> 40:02.942
Poor Chunsam.

40:03.025 --> 40:06.237
I hadn't seen him for a while,
so I came here just in case.

40:06.821 --> 40:09.323
Did someone beat him up? This is so cruel.

40:09.907 --> 40:12.576
-I don't think he was beaten to death.
-Then what?

40:12.660 --> 40:14.620
How did they die all at once?

40:15.788 --> 40:16.789
TUNA

40:22.044 --> 40:23.796
Doesn't it smell sweet?

40:25.339 --> 40:26.340
It does.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.929
One of them is missing.

40:32.012 --> 40:33.305
That one. Roy.

40:33.973 --> 40:34.849
Roy.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.143
-Roy?
-Roy?

40:37.226 --> 40:39.353
-Roy.
-Roy.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.397
-Roy.
-Roy.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.649
Roy!

40:45.151 --> 40:46.360
Roy!

41:06.547 --> 41:07.423
Roy.

41:18.684 --> 41:21.270
Someone wanted to kill
and burn them all at once.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.355
Who would do such an evil thing?

41:23.439 --> 41:24.773
Only Roy got away.

41:25.357 --> 41:26.317
Who would it be?

41:29.487 --> 41:30.988
We'll have to find out.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.407
<i>Yes, I looked into it.</i>

41:33.491 --> 41:35.993
<i>I told you to check if it was a suicide.</i>

41:36.076 --> 41:37.536
Why dig into his acquaintances?

41:37.620 --> 41:39.413
Because something is fishy.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.207
<i>I didn't find anything unusual.</i>

41:41.290 --> 41:44.293
It's true that his colleagues died
every 3 to 4 months.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.378
Kim Seop-ryong died of a heart attack.

41:50.841 --> 41:54.345
<i>Han Man-gu died
with his mistress in a car crash.</i>

41:56.096 --> 41:59.183
<i>And the police got a report
that the last one committed suicide.</i>

41:59.767 --> 42:01.685
Why connect these cases together?

42:02.895 --> 42:04.480
What about that other thing?

42:04.563 --> 42:06.357
Nothing unusual in Yoon's call history.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.442
Just her work, church,
hospital, and kindergarten.

42:09.610 --> 42:12.363
-That's no fun.
<i>-I did find something odd.</i>

42:12.446 --> 42:15.783
There's a record of Kim Min-gyu's phone
being tracked after he went missing.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.369
<i>It was turned on
three months after he went missing.</i>

42:18.452 --> 42:20.538
The cops just thought it was stolen.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.999
Which base station pinged
the signal? Was it far from the cliff?

42:40.599 --> 42:43.894

<i>Don't your eyes hurt?</i>

44:04.600 --> 44:06.268
Do you see something I don't see?

44:07.394 --> 44:09.146
You always see things I don't.

44:10.481 --> 44:13.025
I can't tell
if anyone would do such a thing.

44:13.651 --> 44:16.236
The cafeteria workers even feed the cats.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.531
Since they feed them,
it'd be easier for them to poison it.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.493
Mr. Jang even asked their names.

44:22.576 --> 44:24.828
-He likes cats.
-He couldn't remember their names.

44:25.371 --> 44:26.997
He said they were smelly.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.666
And the janitor was worried

44:28.749 --> 44:31.752
that no one would be here
to feed the cats during breaks.

44:33.962 --> 44:37.466
Hey, that makes no sense.
He could just feed them himself.

44:37.549 --> 44:39.760
Hey. It can't be the janitor.

44:39.843 --> 44:41.762
He really adored those cats.

44:54.983 --> 44:57.111
Remember how
the canned tuna smelled sweet?

44:57.194 --> 44:58.237
That's antifreeze.

44:58.320 --> 45:01.907
If you replace oil with antifreeze,
they eat it up, thinking it's tuna.

45:02.491 --> 45:03.575
How do you know that?

45:03.659 --> 45:04.952
It's common knowledge.

45:05.577 --> 45:06.912
But Roy didn't eat that.

45:09.123 --> 45:12.209
You know, he ran away whenever he saw men.

45:12.292 --> 45:15.629
So it has to be a man who knows a lot

45:16.422 --> 45:20.509
about students and their routines
since a lot of them go see the cats.

45:20.592 --> 45:23.137
And someone
who wouldn't look suspicious for carrying

45:23.762 --> 45:25.264
a sack or antifreeze.

45:26.265 --> 45:27.349
I see.

45:27.933 --> 45:29.309
So who is it?

45:30.602 --> 45:32.855
-What will you do if we get him?
-I'll kill him.

45:32.938 --> 45:34.857
Why should he get to live
when those cats died?

45:38.110 --> 45:39.153
Okay.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.617
We should get a room too.

45:48.370 --> 45:50.330
NEW WORLD MOTEL

46:08.015 --> 46:09.224
It's 15,000 won.

46:12.227 --> 46:13.604
I don't have smaller bills.

46:13.687 --> 46:17.274
So can you give me
that thing instead of change?

46:17.357 --> 46:18.692
Pardon?

46:25.240 --> 46:26.408
I need 20,000 won more.

46:35.667 --> 46:37.127
WE PROMISE YOU A VERY LONG NIGHT

46:56.438 --> 46:58.607
Goodness. What am I going to do?

47:00.192 --> 47:01.902
A lot of people come and go here.

47:02.694 --> 47:05.948
I don't think anyone here
would remember your husband.

47:06.031 --> 47:08.575
The thing is,
we don't remember their faces

47:08.659 --> 47:10.452
unless they're particularly handsome.

47:10.536 --> 47:15.332
Or unless their you-know-what
is rather exotic.

47:17.584 --> 47:18.794
"Rather exotic"?

47:22.965 --> 47:26.593
My husband's is just regular sized.

47:28.095 --> 47:30.347
Gosh. How am I going to find him?

47:32.349 --> 47:35.185
Goodness. I've met all kinds
of weirdos in this line of work.

47:35.269 --> 47:37.854
Some perverts don't do anything.
They just stare at us.

47:38.814 --> 47:42.150
But he was probably here
less than a year ago.

47:42.234 --> 47:43.193
A year?

47:43.986 --> 47:45.362
Let's see.

47:45.445 --> 47:47.656
Some guy cried
while taking off his clothes.

47:48.156 --> 47:51.743
And some guy kept a mask
and sunglasses on the entire time.

47:52.661 --> 47:56.248
Anyway, you're wasting
your time and tears on this jerk.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.752
-Tell me about that bastard.
-Who?

48:01.461 --> 48:02.462
The one with a mask.

48:04.256 --> 48:06.508
<i>They probably made contact
through Mironet.</i>

48:06.592 --> 48:08.802
-Sweety.
-Come in.

48:11.346 --> 48:14.474
He got a room at an automated motel.
He wanted me to come over fast.

48:14.975 --> 48:15.976
Wait.

48:29.156 --> 48:32.034
F205 IS WEARING A MASK. WHAT THE HELL?

48:32.117 --> 48:35.621
We don't like that kind of stuff.
So I reported it right away.

48:36.413 --> 48:38.457
Also because of what happened before.

48:39.791 --> 48:41.293
WE PROMISE YOU A VERY LONG NIGHT

48:53.096 --> 48:55.015
Gosh. I have to take it off first.

49:00.103 --> 49:01.063
Gosh.

49:03.065 --> 49:04.691
WE'RE ON STANDBY. JUST DO YOUR JOB.

49:05.734 --> 49:07.319
All right. Let's do it.

49:07.986 --> 49:10.280
Sweety, your knee is bleeding.

49:12.407 --> 49:15.410
But I guess nothing else happened.
That's all I remember.

49:15.494 --> 49:17.037
When was that exactly?

49:17.746 --> 49:19.164
You're ridiculous.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.874
How am I supposed to remember that?

49:21.500 --> 49:24.544
-You texted your manager.
-Right. The text.

49:26.838 --> 49:27.923
MASK

49:29.007 --> 49:31.051
I got it. It was October 21.

49:31.134 --> 49:32.386
What's your problem?

49:34.262 --> 49:35.263
Honey.

49:35.764 --> 49:37.849
Gosh. Was that you?

49:38.600 --> 49:40.560
Was that you?

49:42.020 --> 49:43.355
I miss you.

49:44.940 --> 49:46.858
So your manager used this app, right?

49:47.734 --> 49:51.238
It leaves no personal information
and the chats get deleted right away.

49:51.321 --> 49:52.656
A lot of people use it.

49:53.782 --> 49:56.368
I won't be able to find anything
even if I look into it.

49:59.871 --> 50:01.707
Anyway, what did you mean by "before"?

50:01.790 --> 50:04.543
People here party on boats
from time to time.

50:05.210 --> 50:07.421
Two girls were sent over there.

50:07.504 --> 50:10.006
One died in a car accident
and the other committed suicide.

50:10.090 --> 50:12.759
Are you talking about the people
from Hyochang Bio?

50:12.843 --> 50:15.429
Gosh. You must've heard the rumor.

50:16.763 --> 50:17.681
What rumor?

50:18.765 --> 50:23.228
Around that time, they fished out
a dead body from the breakwater.

50:23.311 --> 50:26.231
Rumor has it that it was someone
who died while doing chores

50:26.314 --> 50:28.358
for the people on the boat.

50:28.442 --> 50:31.820
They say that he held a grudge
against them and cursed them,

50:31.903 --> 50:34.239
which is why everyone on the boat died.

50:35.115 --> 50:36.950
Hey, I'm not done! Where are you going?

50:37.033 --> 50:37.993
Hey!

50:38.785 --> 50:41.204
Who's going to pay for this?

50:41.830 --> 50:43.206
It indeed is fishy.

50:43.874 --> 50:47.669
I might be acting hastily in linking
the masked man and Kim Min-gyu together.

50:48.670 --> 50:51.006
But the day of the masked man's appearance

50:51.089 --> 50:54.301
happened to be the day
his phone was turned on.

50:54.384 --> 50:56.595
That means he had an itch.

50:57.888 --> 51:00.390
She wanted me to see
if he could have committed suicide,

51:00.474 --> 51:02.642
but I found that he could still be alive.

51:03.393 --> 51:06.938
Did he run away for fear
that the curse might kill him?

51:07.522 --> 51:11.985
But can you fake a suicide
all on your own?

51:12.068 --> 51:14.780
<i>-Joy to the world!

51:14.863 --> 51:17.365

51:38.637 --> 51:41.640
<i>He really did bring her new crayons.
It wasn't a dream.</i>

51:41.723 --> 51:43.433
<i>DREAM</i>

51:44.518 --> 51:45.977
MARCH 14, 2021, <i>RAINBOW</i>

51:46.061 --> 51:48.647

No mother would buy flour-based snacks
for their diabetic child.

52:16.424 --> 52:18.718
She doesn't even let
Seon-mi eat a birthday cake.

52:18.802 --> 52:21.137
It means there's someone else
who likes snacks.

52:21.972 --> 52:24.933
Kim Min-gyu didn't commit suicide
or wasn't murdered.

52:25.934 --> 52:28.812
He's alive, and
Yoon Jae-yeong is harboring him.

52:32.691 --> 52:34.401
And his whereabouts…

52:37.362 --> 52:38.905
I'll have to start looking.

54:27.180 --> 54:29.391
Gosh. Those darned cats.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.067
Goodness. What should I do, sir?

54:39.150 --> 54:40.568
I'm in front of the church.

54:40.652 --> 54:43.279
Some man is doing something to a car.

54:43.363 --> 54:46.491
Goodness. He punctured the tire.

54:46.574 --> 54:49.369
I'm scared. Please come quickly.

54:49.452 --> 54:51.496
Hurry, please.

54:53.832 --> 54:55.291
We don't have time. Hurry up.

54:56.251 --> 54:57.252
Hurry up.

55:26.156 --> 55:27.198
It's me.

55:27.282 --> 55:29.868
Tell me the birthdays
of everyone in the family.

55:29.951 --> 55:32.412
-<i>What are you up to now?</i>
-Breaking in. I need to find him.

55:32.495 --> 55:34.664
-<i>What?</i>
-Hurry. I don't have time.

55:42.255 --> 55:44.841
Nice, Santa.

55:45.675 --> 55:47.594
Well done.

55:47.677 --> 55:49.512
You took off your shoes. How polite.

55:50.263 --> 55:51.139
Great.

55:51.973 --> 55:54.350
-Excuse me. Hello.
-Hello.

55:54.434 --> 55:56.644
-Coming through.
-What's going on?

55:56.728 --> 55:57.854
Excuse me.

55:57.937 --> 56:00.065
-It's a flat tire.
-Why are there cops?

56:00.148 --> 56:02.275
-What…
-What happened?

56:02.859 --> 56:04.152
-Hello.
-Hey.

56:05.403 --> 56:08.198
-Is this your car?
-What happened to my car?

56:08.782 --> 56:10.408
We also got a report.

56:10.492 --> 56:12.535
I heard some man did it. Goodness.

56:12.619 --> 56:14.412
This is quite vicious.

56:14.496 --> 56:15.413
What happened?

56:15.497 --> 56:17.540
Hey. All right. Go home, everyone!

56:17.624 --> 56:19.250
-Nothing to see here!
-What is it?

56:19.918 --> 56:23.171
You can't drive your car,
so I'll drop you off at your house.

56:23.254 --> 56:25.340
No, it's okay. We can take a cab.

56:25.423 --> 56:27.717
Why waste money on cabs?

56:27.801 --> 56:30.345
Besides, I need to ask you some questions.

56:31.096 --> 56:33.098
Seon-mi, have you been in a police car?

56:33.181 --> 56:34.307
Do you want to ride one?

56:34.390 --> 56:36.559
-Yes!
-You got it. Let's go.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.771
Gosh. You grew a lot.

56:43.441 --> 56:46.069
No. He's not here.

56:47.904 --> 56:50.198
Of course, he wouldn't be here.

56:51.533 --> 56:53.618
Where could he be?

56:54.702 --> 56:56.579
Where?

57:20.770 --> 57:22.063
Gosh, my back.

57:33.533 --> 57:36.703
Well, isn't it tough raising a kid alone?

57:37.287 --> 57:38.705
It's all right.

57:38.788 --> 57:40.915
Gosh. Being a single mom must be tough.

57:41.833 --> 57:44.669
Anyway, do you have any idea
who might've done this?

57:46.921 --> 57:48.465
Not really.

57:51.718 --> 57:54.471
I heard the insurance payout
is quite a large sum.

57:57.182 --> 57:59.058
People are talking, you know.

57:59.601 --> 58:00.894
Since you're not from here,

58:00.977 --> 58:03.146
it must be hard enough
raising a kid alone.

58:03.229 --> 58:04.522
You need a man at home.

58:05.231 --> 58:08.359
And kids need their dads to feel safer.

58:08.443 --> 58:09.819
I have a dad.

58:10.403 --> 58:11.237
What?

58:14.240 --> 58:16.576
Right. You have a dad.

58:16.659 --> 58:19.621
I bet he's watching over you
from up there.

58:51.569 --> 58:53.655
<i>Isn't the food ready yet? I'm hungry.</i>

59:00.203 --> 59:01.371
Fifty meters…

59:09.879 --> 59:12.924
Santa, go out through the front door
and search to your left.

59:13.007 --> 59:15.051
See if there's a place for a man to hide.

59:15.134 --> 59:17.178
He must be within 50m,
so it won't take long.

59:17.262 --> 59:18.221
Hurry.

59:25.895 --> 59:29.148
Seon-mi, remember how I told you
to act in front of other people?

59:29.232 --> 59:32.110
That I shouldn't talk about Dad.

59:32.193 --> 59:33.820
I'm sorry, Mom.

1:00:41.846 --> 1:00:43.014
Mr. Kim Min-gyu.

1:00:45.391 --> 1:00:47.143
It's over. Come on out.

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:50.521
Mr. Kim.

1:00:52.774 --> 1:00:53.816
Kim Min-gyu.

1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:03.368
Kim Min-gyu! Stop right there!

1:01:05.078 --> 1:01:06.079
Kim Min-gyu!

1:01:07.622 --> 1:01:08.706
Kim Min-gyu!

1:01:09.749 --> 1:01:10.792
Stop!

1:01:35.024 --> 1:01:36.109
Kim Min-gyu.

1:01:39.112 --> 1:01:41.364
I'm not him! I'm not!

1:01:54.669 --> 1:01:55.712
Hey.

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:01.175
Hey. Wait!

1:02:02.093 --> 1:02:04.679
Listen.

1:02:05.304 --> 1:02:07.390
Hey, why don't we talk?

1:02:08.433 --> 1:02:10.935
I already found out about you.

1:02:11.436 --> 1:02:12.770
It's no use running away.

1:04:03.589 --> 1:04:06.551
Damn it. Do I have to go in there?

1:05:00.187 --> 1:05:01.147
Mr. Kim.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:32.845
<i>The match between
Go Grandmaster Lee Se-dol</i>

1:05:32.929 --> 1:05:35.848
<i>and AlphaGo
was the definition of excitement.</i>

1:05:35.932 --> 1:05:38.392
<i>But even the spectators…</i>

1:05:41.395 --> 1:05:43.898
Gosh, that cat again.

1:05:43.981 --> 1:05:45.107
Damn it.

1:05:46.192 --> 1:05:48.194
Damn it.

1:05:54.867 --> 1:05:56.452
Gosh, damn it.

1:06:02.249 --> 1:06:03.417
Why won't it open?

1:06:39.495 --> 1:06:42.206
"No. Let me drink it."

1:06:44.625 --> 1:06:48.087
"The drink is poisoned. It's too late."

1:06:49.547 --> 1:06:51.924
-This one is too serious.
-This one's too boring.

1:06:52.008 --> 1:06:54.593
-You try it.
-Come on.

1:06:54.677 --> 1:06:57.722
How much did he drink
for something like that to happen?

1:06:59.223 --> 1:07:01.225
I shouldn't be careful with alcohol.

1:07:01.934 --> 1:07:04.478
-"Drink it."
-"The drink is poisoned."

1:07:04.562 --> 1:07:08.024
Drinking a lot of alcohol can save you
when you consume antifreeze.

1:07:08.774 --> 1:07:10.943
-It cleanses your stomach.
-What?

1:07:11.027 --> 1:07:15.865
Chunsam and the cats might have survived
if they drank alcohol like the janitor.

1:07:15.948 --> 1:07:17.366
"Let me drink it."

1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:20.077
I wanted to kill him…

1:07:21.871 --> 1:07:23.789
but I guess it wasn't enough.

1:07:25.082 --> 1:07:27.376
What are you talking about?

1:07:29.795 --> 1:07:32.381
What? I thought you wanted to kill him.

1:07:33.215 --> 1:07:34.050
What?

1:07:35.885 --> 1:07:38.095
You said you wanted to kill him.

1:07:39.013 --> 1:07:40.890
Let go. You're hurting me.

1:07:42.892 --> 1:07:45.394
-Mr. Jang!
-Stop practicing for a second.

1:07:45.478 --> 1:07:47.897
-Gather around.
-No way.

1:07:48.939 --> 1:07:51.901
-Why? Is this about the janitor?
-She's a cop.

1:07:51.984 --> 1:07:55.362
Hey, I heard he didn't die.
Wasn't it because he drank too much?

1:07:55.446 --> 1:07:58.157
By the way, you are his wife, aren't you?

1:07:58.991 --> 1:08:00.743
I saw her on the Job Shadow Day.

1:08:00.826 --> 1:08:01.994
-No way.
-No way.

1:08:02.078 --> 1:08:04.914
You're usually the ones
to leave school last.

1:08:04.997 --> 1:08:06.957
She came here to ask you

1:08:07.041 --> 1:08:09.668
if anyone saw anything
on the day of the incident.

1:08:09.752 --> 1:08:11.295
Just tell her what you saw.

1:08:11.378 --> 1:08:13.297
Your cop wife is super cool.

1:08:13.380 --> 1:08:15.007
-I'm scared.
-Quiet.

1:08:15.716 --> 1:08:18.928
-Do you want to talk to them separately?
-Yes. That'll be better.

1:08:21.597 --> 1:08:23.641
Can we start with you?

1:08:23.724 --> 1:08:25.059
I've got nothing.

1:08:25.142 --> 1:08:26.310
What?

1:08:26.393 --> 1:08:28.646
I left early that day,
so I've got nothing to say.

1:08:31.065 --> 1:08:34.151
I will decide
if you have nothing to say or not.

<i>You must've thought
he was better off dead, right?</i>

1:10:01.030 --> 1:10:02.531
<i>You asked them to kill him.</i>

1:10:02.615 --> 1:10:04.909
<i>I never asked them to kill him.
I didn't do anything.</i>

1:10:04.992 --> 1:10:07.828

-<i>Kill him. He deserves it.</i>

1:10:07.912 --> 1:10:10.080
<i>That's such a frightening thing to say.</i>

<i>So let's catch that murderer together.</i>
