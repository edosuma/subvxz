<i>The one who has meant</i>
<i>the most to me in life…</i>

00:51.920 --> 00:54.727
<i>…is Molotov.</i>

00:54.800 --> 00:56.810
Well.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.881
Oh! Well. Well, you go on out.

01:03.960 --> 01:09.924
Jump out, it'll get real cold in here damn
quick if you're going to linger like that.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.369
Food'll be in an hour, so you'll have
to meow so that I can hear you.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.205
Molotov! Come to daddy.

01:21.280 --> 01:26.043
You wanna come and eat some? Molotov!

01:31.040 --> 01:33.050
No!

01:35.520 --> 01:37.923
No, no, no...

01:38.000 --> 01:41.124
No, no, no!

01:43.200 --> 01:45.210
No, no

01:45.280 --> 01:47.803
Bastard!

01:49.800 --> 01:53.121
God dammit'...

01:54.200 --> 02:00.120
Fuckin' fox bastard.
This will be your last meal!

02:02.040 --> 02:06.049
I'll show you some goddamn dessert!

02:23.080 --> 02:29.961
<i>All of a sudden I had blasted</i>
<i>my way right into the nursing home.</i>

02:30.040 --> 02:32.770
61.

02:32.840 --> 02:36.641
- How's it going?
-62.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.882
Now I lost count.
How many to each box?

02:40.960 --> 02:46.651
- There's 10 to each box, it says so right here.
- You can never trust that.

02:46.720 --> 02:51.810
- It's usually right.
- I'll just have to count again.

02:51.880 --> 02:56.085
I'll start over. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

04:39.400 --> 04:45.484
♫ Long may he live for.
Long may he live for, long may
he live for a hundred years ♫

04:45.560 --> 04:47.810
♫ Of course he shall live for… ♫

04:47.880 --> 04:51.004
Allan! Allan!

04:51.080 --> 04:54.488
Allan? Allan?

04:54.560 --> 04:58.525
Allan? - Oh my god, where is he?

04:58.600 --> 05:02.248
- Where's the old guy?
- Where'd he go to?

05:25.160 --> 05:27.486
Hi!

05:28.480 --> 05:33.570
Well. Is there a...
Can one travel somewhere from here?

05:33.640 --> 05:38.326
- Where did you say you were going?
- I didn't.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.601
Are there any means of transport
leaving from here?

05:41.680 --> 05:45.328
- When?
- Yes…

05:45.400 --> 05:48.841
Anytime really.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.121
Is there anything running here?

05:52.200 --> 05:56.569
The bus to Strängnäs leaves in 3 minutes.

05:56.640 --> 06:00.649
- Strängnäs?
- Yes, route 322. Is that of interest?

06:00.720 --> 06:03.724
Yes…

06:03.800 --> 06:06.684
Is this enough?

06:08.080 --> 06:12.602
No, it's not enough.
You can get as far as Byringe, maybe.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.448
- What's in Byringe?
- Not a damn thing.

06:16.520 --> 06:20.889
Uh-huh! A one way
ticket to Byringe, thanks.

06:23.080 --> 06:27.602
And you are... over 65...

06:27.680 --> 06:31.962
- What?
-Well. Let's see…

06:37.920 --> 06:40.684
- There you go.
- Thank you.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.686
Fucking crap!

06:48.760 --> 06:51.807
Come on, what the fuck?!

06:52.840 --> 06:55.921
How did they figure this shit?

06:56.000 --> 07:01.407
Hold the bag! Don't let go of it!
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

07:01.480 --> 07:04.047
Well…

07:09.760 --> 07:13.321
The old fart must have
vanished into thin air!

07:13.400 --> 07:19.768
It's dark and locked in the basement.
There's no way he got in down here.

07:19.840 --> 07:25.367
We have to call the police. Will you
do it, or should I do it? You call them!

07:25.440 --> 07:30.246
Allan!

07:30.320 --> 07:36.404
<i>There are plenty of people who have shouted</i>
<i>at me, from conductors to dictators.</i>

07:36.480 --> 07:40.445
Where the fuck are you, old-timer?! Shit!

07:45.120 --> 07:47.326
Allan!

07:47.400 --> 07:50.721
<i>The first one to scream</i>
<i>because of me was my mother.</i>

07:50.800 --> 07:55.202
<i>I do not remember her screaming,</i>
<i>but I'm pretty sure she did.</i>

07:55.280 --> 08:01.200
<i>I probably screamed too.</i>
<i>That's what new-borns do the</i>
<i>first time they get to look around.</i>

08:01.280 --> 08:04.448
<i>The old man I never got to see</i>
<i>yelling that much.</i>

08:04.520 --> 08:08.846
- Karlsson has blasphemed!
- Because I showed the rubberman?

08:08.920 --> 08:13.125
It's the only solution to famine and strife.
You call that blaspheming?

08:13.200 --> 08:18.006
If you do it during Children's Day at
the main square in downtown Malmköping...

08:18.080 --> 08:21.925
- I need to warn people...
-...then that is blaspheming!

08:22.000 --> 08:25.081
<i>I was nine the last time I saw him.</i>

08:25.160 --> 08:31.648
It's impossible to live in this sanctimonious
monarchy. I'm going to Russia!

08:34.600 --> 08:39.647
<i>Dad declared his own republic on</i>
<i>160 sq-feet right in the middle of Moscow.</i>

08:39.720 --> 08:46.208
This is the solution to famine and strife!
With this, the woman will not be with child.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.005
No, no children. <i>Njet.</i>
This is fantastic.

08:50.080 --> 08:55.410
<i>- There, my dad could do as he pleased.</i>
- What are you doing?

08:55.480 --> 09:00.603
<i>- Until the Ruskies dealt with him.</i>
- But this is the solution to famine and strife!

09:00.680 --> 09:04.241
Can I say just one last thing?

09:07.520 --> 09:10.644
Flatfoot, flatfoot, flatfoot!

09:12.600 --> 09:14.042
Mrs Karlsson...

09:14.120 --> 09:18.249
<i>The news of fathers passing</i>
<i>came on a sunny day in April.</i>

09:18.320 --> 09:24.448
<i>That was the same day that I discovered</i>
<i>how sweet it is to blow things up.</i>

09:26.280 --> 09:30.889
<i>All that father left behind</i>
<i>came in a package.</i>

09:30.960 --> 09:36.083
<i>Mother got a colourful egg, made by a</i>
<i>Fabbe-something.</i>

09:36.160 --> 09:40.923
<i>I got one of those</i>
<i>Russian nesting dolls, Matryoshka.</i>

09:41.000 --> 09:43.610
<i>And a camera!</i>

09:43.680 --> 09:46.487
<i>Those were some good presents.</i>

09:51.320 --> 09:57.208
<i>Mom traded that egg at Trader Gustavsson's.</i>

09:57.280 --> 10:03.889
<i>It turned out that he had made a good deal.</i>
<i>But that's what traders do!</i>

10:03.960 --> 10:07.608
<i>After dads passing, mother</i>
<i>coughed for two years-</i>

10:07.680 --> 10:14.168
<i>-before she too stepped in to that supposed</i>
<i>heaven where dad might also reside.</i>

10:14.240 --> 10:18.282
<i>That made me a bit</i>
<i>uneasy about the future...</i>

10:18.360 --> 10:21.888
<i>...but I guess that's what happens when</i>
<i>kids are about to become orphans.</i>

10:21.960 --> 10:25.641
- How will I manage?
- You sound like your father.

10:25.720 --> 10:32.361
He was always thinking. Look at what
happened. Thinking is futile.

10:32.440 --> 10:36.962
The only sure thing is
that things are what they are...

10:37.040 --> 10:40.164
...and will be what they will.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.730
<i>Those were my mothers last words.</i>

10:46.720 --> 10:50.368
<i>Ever since then I had</i>
<i>to get by on my own.</i>

11:03.960 --> 11:06.887
- Hello! Hello!
- Huh?

11:06.960 --> 11:11.165
- You forgot your bag.
- Oh yes, that one. It's fine.

11:37.080 --> 11:40.968
There are no trains
running here. It's closed.

11:41.040 --> 11:45.846
- Huh, what did you say?
- There are no trains running here.

11:45.920 --> 11:50.202
- The Station is closed.
- Well, yes.

11:50.280 --> 11:54.048
I can see that. I wasn't born yesterday.

11:54.120 --> 11:58.566
- What are you doing here then?
- The bus, it stopped here.

11:58.640 --> 12:03.523
Uh-huh. But then
wheres-to are you going?

12:03.600 --> 12:07.805
Wheres-to? Well, no... It's...

12:07.880 --> 12:10.610
I don't know. We'll have to see.

12:10.680 --> 12:15.169
- Have you been hoboing long?
- H-H-Hoboing?

12:15.240 --> 12:18.484
It's a decent sized bag
you're lugging around.

12:18.560 --> 12:24.011
Nah, this thing? It's not mine.
It sort of just came with me.

12:24.080 --> 12:28.242
- A thieving oldster then.
- Haha, well...

12:29.600 --> 12:33.882
- Are you hungry?
- Ah shucks, food? I'm mainly thirsty.

12:33.960 --> 12:38.569
- We can fix that!
- Really, well. Lovely.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.841
- Can you find where we're going?
- I usually practice running here...
- I don't give a flying fuck!

12:41.920 --> 12:45.481
- I know the area...
- I said: Can you find your way!?

12:45.560 --> 12:49.722
- Yes, I know the area.
- That's fuckin' good fortune for you!

12:49.800 --> 12:52.290
What the hell...

12:53.440 --> 12:58.323
- What are you doing?
What's the problem?
- It's out of gas.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.328
Do you have a fuckin' spare can or what?
Huh?!

13:07.400 --> 13:12.447
There's only one house in Byringe!
It's brown... or light brown.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.163
It's a bit yellow too!

13:15.240 --> 13:20.767
- You don't suppose he just went astray?
- Oh no, I don't think so.
His mental acumen is fine.

13:20.840 --> 13:27.208
There's nothing wrong with his brain.
Can the inspector understad how someone
just sneaks out of their own party? -No

13:27.280 --> 13:32.043
I've put in so much work for his sake
and he just up and disappears.

13:32.120 --> 13:37.210
We bought a marzipan
cake for at least 40 people.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.885
We ordered it for his sake,
because he likes marzipan cake.

13:40.960 --> 13:45.886
- Normally we just eat whipped cream cakes
here. Marzipan gets stuck in the oldies' teeth.
-Mmmm

13:45.960 --> 13:51.411
What are we to do with that cake?
Here I am with a huge cake for a bunch
of old-timers that can't eat marzipan.

13:51.480 --> 13:55.882
- Well, well.
- I personally fancy Schwarzwald cake,
but then again it's not me having a birthday.

13:55.960 --> 14:01.444
You know what? You call me when
he gets back, because cases like
this usually get solved very quickly.

14:01.520 --> 14:07.844
Has he jumped out of the window? You don't
suppose he's jumped out of the window? It was
open this morning when we came in singing.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.929
- It was actually open then.
- Well, I wouldn't know.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.641
- It's entirely possible. Call me when he
gets back. It'll probably fix itself.
- I don't think so.  -Oh no?

14:19.880 --> 14:25.888
Oh man, nursing homes! They have the
idea that I should go come fall.

14:27.160 --> 14:31.409
- I've only ever set my foot there once.
- Well, well...

14:31.480 --> 14:35.161
- After four there's always
room for one more.
- Haha, yes.

14:36.600 --> 14:41.723
I got a buck to entertain the
old-timers with my accordion.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.443
They sat there gaping
like hollow birds nests.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.884
- So you play the accordion?
- Oh yes.

14:47.960 --> 14:52.963
Wretched souls, just sitting there...
I'd rather sit in the big house.

14:54.880 --> 14:59.523
- Well, Congrats again!
- Oh right, damnit! I forgot about that.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.681
Say hi to Tiny Tim!

15:06.040 --> 15:09.208
Ever had a ball and chain?

15:11.120 --> 15:16.483
- Nah, shucks, it never turned out that way.
- How the hell did you manage that?!

15:17.560 --> 15:24.889
Do you tinkle outside? I need to make
room for the next round. It's pressing...

15:29.240 --> 15:34.287
A fine thing that you managed to eat!
There'll be dessert later.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.244
Yes yes, I'm coming...

15:39.840 --> 15:44.449
Nice.
- Hello, anyone there? Hello!

15:44.520 --> 15:47.447
- Where's the old fart and the bag?
- It's closed.

15:47.520 --> 15:52.523
<i>- Whaddaya mean closed?</i>
<i>-It's not a railway station.</i>

15:52.600 --> 15:56.969
<i>- Where's the old fart and my bag?</i>
<i>-I live alone here...</i>

15:57.040 --> 16:00.481
<i>You think I'm fuckin' stupid?</i>
<i>Who the fuck's been sitting here then?</i>

16:00.560 --> 16:04.645
- No... Oww!
- Old fuck!

16:06.360 --> 16:09.604
- Watch it, goddammit!
- Oww!

16:09.680 --> 16:12.564
- Oww! Stop it!
- You old fuck! You feel me?

16:12.640 --> 16:15.644
- You...
- I'm a fuckin' kill you!

16:15.720 --> 16:18.210
- Watch it!
- Yes!

16:18.280 --> 16:20.486
Stop hitting!

16:20.560 --> 16:25.006
- Oww, oww, oww!
- Wanna flip a coin?

16:25.080 --> 16:30.410
- We'll see if you get to keep living.
- Stop it. Just calm down...

16:30.480 --> 16:33.484
Lucky you that I don't have any coins!

16:33.560 --> 16:40.409
- There's a coin bowl in the hallway.
- The hallway? Are you
completely fuckin' stupid?

16:43.040 --> 16:46.208
- Goddammit, what a whack!
- You don't say?

16:46.280 --> 16:50.322
Hey you, what about that dessert
you were talking about?

16:50.400 --> 16:56.047
- We need to get him out of here...
- Wha..What?
- Well before he comes to.

16:58.320 --> 17:03.804
I have to admit that I'm
getting a bit curious...

17:03.880 --> 17:05.965
…about what's in the bag.

17:08.240 --> 17:12.402
There! That's the quickest way...

17:12.480 --> 17:18.848
- Oops, that was a bit much!
I can take that one.
- ...to open, even if you do
know the combination.

17:18.920 --> 17:22.241
You want it neat, or?

17:24.480 --> 17:28.729
Oh, lord almighty!

17:28.800 --> 17:34.884
That was a whole lot of cash. No
wonder why the little guy was so cranky.

17:34.960 --> 17:39.209
<i>Open up, for fuck'sake!</i>
<i>You hear me old-timer?!</i>

17:39.280 --> 17:41.410
Let me out!

17:41.480 --> 17:46.243
<i>- I just want that fuckin' bag.</i>
- Calm down!
- <i>I won't hit you!</i>

17:50.920 --> 17:52.809
Seriously, hey!

17:52.880 --> 17:57.566
- What was that?
- Ah well, I turned on the unit.

17:57.640 --> 18:03.244
<i>I'll take the fuckin' bag and then</i>
<i>I'm out of here. I won't hit you.</i>

18:03.320 --> 18:08.487
<i>It's easy to make rosey plans when</i>
<i>you're locked up or in deep shit.</i>

18:08.560 --> 18:16.010
<i>That won't do much for you. Life is what</i>
<i>it is, and will be what it will anyway.</i>

18:16.080 --> 18:20.165
<i>That's a lesson Trader</i>
<i>Gustavsson learnt.</i>

18:21.600 --> 18:26.450
- Wait here, Bibi!
- Come back soon.

18:26.520 --> 18:32.331
<i>He had planned his escapade well. He</i>
<i>picked a sunny day, a beautiful road...</i>

18:32.400 --> 18:38.244
<i>...and a perfect hill for his pee-break,</i>
<i>and still it went south.</i>

18:38.320 --> 18:43.126
<i>Because I had picked the very same</i>
<i>hill for my test blast.</i>

18:49.960 --> 18:52.330
<i>She screamed to high heavens.</i>

18:52.400 --> 18:58.648
<i>I guess that's what mistresses do when</i>
<i>trader-heads plonk down on car hoods.</i>

18:59.640 --> 19:06.040
<i>Even though the test blast was successful,</i>
<i>I got a oneway ticket to the mental hospital.</i>

19:12.360 --> 19:14.370
There.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.885
This is your room now,
no monkey business!

19:41.040 --> 19:43.770
<i>Well, after a few years of lock-up-</i>

19:43.840 --> 19:50.961
<i>-I ended up at one of those racial</i>
<i>biologists, that professor Lundborg.</i>

19:51.040 --> 19:53.650
Stop it, Allan.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.009
Hm...

19:57.080 --> 19:59.363
Mm.

20:08.641 --> 20:17.281
<i>"Northern Native"</i>
<i>"Negro musician from U.S.A. Deported."</i>

20:17.282 --> 20:20.161
<i>"Negro musician from U.S.A. Deported."</i>

20:21.880 --> 20:26.730
Does Allan know if you have
any negro-blood in the family?

20:26.800 --> 20:31.890
- No, I.. I don't think so.
- I just can't make sense of this.

20:31.960 --> 20:36.165
Allan has negroid measurements.
You are prone to violence.

20:37.920 --> 20:43.928
- But you are very fair skinned.
- But if the Professor does have a negro
 anywhere I'd really like to meet one!

20:46.800 --> 20:51.443
- Allans father was of revolutionary character.
- Mm-hum, he was a bit special.

20:51.520 --> 20:55.802
And the apple doesn't seem to
fall too far from the tree.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.884
I think we should err on the side of caution.

20:58.960 --> 21:05.689
<i>Lundborg laid out the contraptions</i>
<i>and made sure my genes were not</i>
<i>passed on to the population.</i>

21:05.760 --> 21:09.245
- Doctor, the patient is ready.
- Yes yes.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.367
<i>I guess that what racial biologists do.</i>

21:19.560 --> 21:22.203
You can bandage him up a bit extra.

21:22.280 --> 21:29.489
<i>He wasn't too sure-handed, but for what I</i>
<i>could tell the surgery went well anyway.</i>

21:31.200 --> 21:36.924
- 49,800,000...
- Here's the last one.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.167
- 49,900,000...
- And that one.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.649
- 50,000,000.
- You know how to count, don't you.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.243
Not too shabby!

21:56.280 --> 22:02.648
- Are you still not able to get through?
- I've got no damn clue about what happened
to his phone. The fuckin' phone doesn't work.

22:02.720 --> 22:07.810
Just keep calling. Send a text
goddamnit. Do as you intended, for once.

22:07.880 --> 22:12.369
- But what was he supposed to do?
- He was just to collect a thing, a bag!

22:12.440 --> 22:16.121
- A bag? - Yes a bag. Surely you know
what a friggin' bag is, <i>Bucket</i> ?

22:16.200 --> 22:19.564
A portable carriage space to keep things in.

22:19.640 --> 22:24.009
- Couldn't you have picked up the bag yourself?
- Does this look like a ride
pass from a theme park?

22:24.080 --> 22:28.930
- I forgot about the ankle monitor.
- But I didn't fuckin' forget about it.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.244
Is it <i>The Bolt</i> ?
I'll take this.

22:32.320 --> 22:36.722
- Just shut up! I'll do the talkin'.
- Is it <i>The Bolt</i> ? - I said shut up!

22:36.800 --> 22:41.126
- Hello, it's <i>The Pike</i>.
- Hello mate. How's it going?

22:41.200 --> 22:46.607
"Shit-good"! No problem! What is the
clock for you? We have evening.

22:46.680 --> 22:51.923
Nevermind the about clocks. Now you were
supposed to ring me earlier, weren't you?
Why didn't you ring me earlier?

22:52.000 --> 22:57.571
Ah, yes I know but, ah fuck,
I had some mobile battery troubles.

22:57.640 --> 23:01.769
Listen mate, Calm down! Calm down!

23:01.840 --> 23:08.120
You're stumbling and mumbling, you're
talking gibberish. Maybe you can hand the
phone to someone who I can talk to properly?

23:08.200 --> 23:14.600
Loaders for mobile...Okay wait.
I give to you phone for Caracas.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.886
Hold on, wait.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.204
Caracas, bitch! Phone.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.443
Come!

23:24.240 --> 23:27.408
But who is it?

23:30.920 --> 23:36.250
- Pim! How are you?
- Nevermind how I am! Have you got my cash?

23:36.320 --> 23:39.247
- We have it.
- What do you mean?

23:39.320 --> 23:43.569
One of my boys has the cash.
Therefore we have the cash.
Say that we have the cash. No problems.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.961
<i>Caracas, are you there? Hello!</i>

23:47.040 --> 23:50.000
Hello. <i>The Bolt</i> has it.

23:50.080 --> 23:56.284
- Okay, so everything is
fine then, you've got it?
- He's not here yet but he'll be
here soon. Don't worry.

23:56.360 --> 24:01.570
Just get the bag to my courier by
tomorrow, otherwise you're dead.

24:01.640 --> 24:08.641
I ask you for one fuckin' thing, and
that's for you to say that we have the
money. Is it that fucking hard?
Fuckin' world record!

24:08.720 --> 24:13.166
You take off to Malmköping, and you bring
that idiot back home. This is serious now!

24:22.760 --> 24:25.207
- Java?
- Yes, yes please.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.803
Anacin?

24:28.800 --> 24:32.044
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

24:32.120 --> 24:37.483
- Has he made a ruckus this morning?
- No, not a peep.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.364
Negative 5... Holy hell!

24:53.440 --> 24:57.208
- Goddamnit, what have I done?
- What?

24:57.280 --> 25:01.606
Shit! How could I forget to
turn off the chiller?

25:01.680 --> 25:04.848
Aha, yes. Well, well. It'll...

25:06.760 --> 25:09.370
It'll all work out.

25:09.440 --> 25:14.891
<i>Regret does you no good, as long</i>
<i>as you don't have a time machine.</i>

25:14.960 --> 25:20.848
<i>Eh, regretting something has</i>
<i>never undone the regrettable.</i>

25:20.920 --> 25:27.529
<i>I've never regretted my surgery, on</i>
<i>the contrary, it was a stroke of luck!</i>

25:28.480 --> 25:36.651
<i>If my crotch hadn't been so numb, I would</i>
<i>never had stopped at that cannon foundry.</i>

25:36.720 --> 25:39.921
<i>And never taken up</i>
<i>employment there either.</i>

25:40.000 --> 25:44.042
- These guns...
- We forge the barrels. We are one man short.

25:44.120 --> 25:48.369
You can watch for a week.
- Esteban! Shut up and work!

25:48.440 --> 25:54.207
Si, si, si! We have to work
together to create a better world.

25:54.280 --> 25:58.846
<i>The Spaniard Esteban</i>
<i>was thin, thin as a pennant.</i>

25:58.920 --> 26:04.283
<i>But then again he only used his mouth to talk.</i>
- Come with and fight Franco!

26:05.160 --> 26:09.682
Allan, were do you stand? What do
you want? You must take a stand.

26:09.760 --> 26:13.889
- You have to give me an answer.
- I want to shoot! I like it
when things explode.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.686
We have to do something now!

26:15.760 --> 26:23.526
<i>When the civil war in Spain was</i>
<i>approaching he wanted me to come with</i>
<i>and crush some guy named Franco.</i>

26:23.600 --> 26:29.684
<i>I thought why not? In war you get</i>
<i>to blow all sort of things sky high.</i>

26:29.760 --> 26:32.928
Viva la revolucion! Viva Durutti!

26:33.000 --> 26:36.441
Where are you going?
Come with us! Come with me!
Like the International Brigades...

26:36.520 --> 26:39.884
Durutti says...

26:39.960 --> 26:43.161
- Hitler is a good man.
- We have to stop him.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.408
- I want to sleep!
- One second!

26:47.200 --> 26:54.529
We have not time for sleeping!
We have to fight Franco!
We'd rather die than surrender!

26:54.600 --> 26:59.483
Viva la revolucion!

27:06.400 --> 27:10.802
I have to raise the flag of the republic
and open your revolutionary hearts!

27:10.880 --> 27:15.927
<i>When we got there, the first bullet</i>
<i>of the war had not yet been fired...</i>

27:16.000 --> 27:18.326
Death to fascists! Death to Franco!

27:18.400 --> 27:22.682
<i>...until Esteban shouted, for the last time.</i>

27:22.760 --> 27:26.048
<i>The wise words of my mother came to me.</i>

27:29.400 --> 27:33.889
<i>That dude never got</i>
<i>to blow up any bridges-</i>

27:33.960 --> 27:38.690
<i>-but I, I got to blow up all the more.</i>

27:42.840 --> 27:47.646
And tres, and dos and <i>uno.</i>
Now we'll get some thunder!

27:50.200 --> 27:52.690
Get down, god damn it!

27:52.760 --> 27:59.925
<i>During many, many years, I did nothing
<i>but eat, sleep and blow stuff up.</i></i>

28:00.000 --> 28:04.205
<i>Well, it was a wonderful time!</i>

28:19.640 --> 28:26.204
<i>But perhaps it got to be too much of a</i>
<i>good thing. All of a sudden my want</i>
<i>for explosions was gone.</i>

28:26.280 --> 28:33.249
<i>I thought: "To hell with this!</i>
<i>I'll do something else."</i>

28:33.320 --> 28:40.802
<i>If you've walked up and down Spain a few</i>
<i>thousand miles, you don't mind a ride.</i>

28:40.880 --> 28:43.086
Stop!

28:44.320 --> 28:47.084
Why is he standing in the
middle of the road? So stop!

28:47.160 --> 28:49.443
Stop stop.

28:52.520 --> 28:57.807
<i>It turned out to general Franco</i>
<i>who was out for a sunday drive.</i>

28:57.880 --> 29:03.331
<i>My waiving was apparently appreciated</i>
<i>'cause he treated me to dance, paella...</i>

29:03.400 --> 29:06.688
<i>…and a real bout of rioja-drinking.</i>

29:06.760 --> 29:11.807
<i>That was a perfect</i>
<i>ending to my time in Spain.</i>

29:13.000 --> 29:19.488
My friend Allan, you saved my life.
I want you to have my favourite pistol.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.127
Wow, it's shiny. Flim-flam…

29:22.200 --> 29:25.881
- Care for it.
- Thank you!

29:27.280 --> 29:30.961
Señor! I wonder if it'll fire.

29:31.040 --> 29:34.044
This is how a man dances!

29:42.080 --> 29:45.968
Everybody calm down,
it's my friend Allan!

29:47.320 --> 29:52.847
Tell me, what will you miss
most about our wonderful country?

29:52.920 --> 29:58.010
The wine, and my
friend Esteban who died.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.522
Que Viva Esteban!

30:04.760 --> 30:10.800
- What... what is that beeping?
- Well, it's probably some phone...

30:10.880 --> 30:13.610
Well, there you go.

30:13.680 --> 30:17.842
Let's see here.
Lots of texts pouring in.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.924
- Now?
- Well there's poor coverage in there.

30:21.000 --> 30:26.604
From <i>The Pike</i>, from <i>The Bucket</i>,
<i>The Bucket</i>, <i>The Bucket</i>.

30:26.680 --> 30:32.371
- <i>The Bucket</i>, Mom. <i>The Bucket</i>, <i>The Pike</i>.
- He seems popular.

30:32.440 --> 30:35.881
Well so-so. <i>The Bucket</i> writes:
"Call or die".

30:48.960 --> 30:52.128
Damn it!

30:53.120 --> 30:57.085
- Hello!
- Yeah hi, I'm at the station now.

30:57.160 --> 31:02.523
There's not a single fuckin'
dude here. There's just some
friggin' weirdo at the ticket counter.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.484
- What should I do?
- Well, did you ask him?

31:05.560 --> 31:08.924
- What should I ask him?
- Ask if he's seen anything!

31:09.000 --> 31:11.687
Yeah ok, I'll ask.

31:27.040 --> 31:32.283
Ronny Hult and his wife are here. In the
future you might go get your visitors yourself.

31:32.360 --> 31:36.849
Sorry sorry, I didn't even
know they had arrived.

31:36.920 --> 31:40.088
- Hi…
- Uh-huh, please take a seat.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.361
Well, tell me, but what
was it that happened yesterday?

31:43.440 --> 31:49.360
Well, I work at the Travel center,
and a few hours had passed…

31:49.440 --> 31:52.804
Just say what happened.

31:52.880 --> 31:57.369
- But that's what I'm doing.
- You're not doing it very well.

31:59.040 --> 32:03.442
Ok, there was a guy who jumped me.
He was really violent.

32:03.520 --> 32:07.442
But now you forgot to tell about the old one!

32:07.520 --> 32:13.004
But... First, there was an old person...
Or, there was a man I sold a ticket to.

32:13.080 --> 32:17.482
And that was the centenarian.
The centenarian comes
and buys a ticket from Ronny!

32:17.560 --> 32:24.081
And then the biker guy
comes and beats Ronny up
and forces him to drive over to Byringe.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.767
Hello?

32:54.160 --> 32:55.962
Is there anybody home?

32:59.000 --> 33:02.364
Hey, do you know what time it is?

33:02.440 --> 33:04.646
Yeah...

33:04.720 --> 33:08.729
- It's almost eleven.
- That's good.

33:08.800 --> 33:12.809
Then they'll soon go on
a lunch break in there.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.210
Hey, hey!

33:19.280 --> 33:23.168
- Hello...
- Goodbye.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.447
Uh-huh.

33:40.920 --> 33:47.561
- Oh well, that could have hurt.
- Sometime being dead can have its upsides.

33:51.560 --> 33:54.247
There.

34:04.880 --> 34:08.681
- Should we toss it all?
- Toss all of it!

34:10.320 --> 34:14.165
- What are you going to do now?
- He's gonna go in there.

34:14.239 --> 34:17.603
Ah bastard ...!

34:19.199 --> 34:21.723
There.

34:25.880 --> 34:31.571
Djibouti. Uh-huh, well.
He'll be well travelled.

34:31.639 --> 34:37.407
The advantage with vests is that
size is rarely an issue.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.927
Yeah...

34:51.880 --> 34:55.408
Uh-huh. Damn ladies throw.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.361
- What?
- Julius, you've got to help me with the bag.

35:00.440 --> 35:04.001
- Now that we're two sharing it.
- Hell yeah!

35:04.080 --> 35:08.362
Well of course. And you'll
take that one. Thank you for that.

35:09.480 --> 35:12.003
Hey, you there!

35:12.080 --> 35:16.122
Hey you! Could you hang on a second?
I'm from the police.

35:17.640 --> 35:25.002
Have you... I'm looking for a
hundred-year-old who's lost and strayed
from a nursing home in Malmköping.

35:25.080 --> 35:30.247
- Have you seen any old-timer?
- I've seen an old man on a rail trolley.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.406
He went past with Jonsson.

35:32.480 --> 35:37.166
- Uh-huh, was that Julius Jonsson?
- Yes, exactly.

35:37.240 --> 35:43.160
And then one with a biker vest. He was
very snobby and wearing sunglasses.

35:43.240 --> 35:47.085
Apparently that's something people do
these days. He didn't even greet me.

35:47.160 --> 35:51.649
- But where did you see them?
- At the soccer pitch by Åkers styckebruk.

35:51.720 --> 35:56.406
- Was it a long time since you saw them?
- About half an hour ago.

35:56.480 --> 36:00.041
- Are you sure about that?
- No.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.806
Well...

36:05.040 --> 36:06.482
Bye.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.250
Hey...

36:18.640 --> 36:23.370
Hello! You don't happen to have
room for two hitchhikers do you?

36:24.440 --> 36:27.564
Eh...

36:27.640 --> 36:29.726
Hi.

36:29.800 --> 36:33.929
- Well... Yes, yeah, that could work.
- How nice!

36:34.000 --> 36:39.888
- It's pretty cramped back here.
- Well I can keep the bag in the front seat.

36:39.960 --> 36:44.690
- Where are you going to?
- Is it your kiosk?

36:44.760 --> 36:51.008
No, oh no. I'm just doing some extra
work. I'm studying when not working.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.324
Are you studying?
Not Junior high I assume.

36:54.400 --> 37:00.921
No, no I've tried some different paths.
I've studied a whole lot of different things.

37:02.040 --> 37:06.245
I imagine...that it's a pretty
difficult question this whole thing...

37:06.320 --> 37:10.449
...with employment opportunities and stuff.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.127
- How do you mean?
- No, but...

37:14.200 --> 37:20.764
There are like different...
I mean to say...

37:20.840 --> 37:24.685
- I can ponder...
- That what?

37:24.760 --> 37:30.604
I can imagine difficulties with
this thing about choices. How...

37:30.680 --> 37:36.164
But that's terrific, keeping all doors open.

37:36.240 --> 37:40.162
Yeah, well, never mind. Eh…

37:40.240 --> 37:44.282
- Get in...
- Thank you!

37:45.520 --> 37:48.601
So, where are you headed?

37:49.680 --> 37:53.568
Well... where are you headed?

37:54.560 --> 38:00.131
- I'm going to the traders for some bulk buying.
- Traders? That seems nice.

38:00.200 --> 38:05.290
- Are you sure? It's right in
the middle of nowhere.
- Nowhere is underrated.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.164
Yes, perhaps it is.

38:17.240 --> 38:21.883
Hey, can't you do the local ads?
That'd be perfect!

38:21.960 --> 38:26.690
Yeah, Skandia, they're 150 years old,
and the geezer is 100 old.

38:26.760 --> 38:31.970
That would be great. I mean, you as
a cop could do something loco with it.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.688
- No, I won't do it.
- But both of 'em are old.

38:35.760 --> 38:40.009
- No but, can't you hear what I'm saying?
I'm a cop for crap's sake.
- It would be great, this thing.

38:40.080 --> 38:47.485
Won't you relent? I'm fucking employed by
the government! I can't friggin' sit here
and do ads on this shitty radio station.

38:47.560 --> 38:53.688
The fresh 70ies group "The Police"
performed the song "Message in a bottle".

38:53.760 --> 38:58.523
- Now I've got officer Aronsson in the studio.
- Inspector.

38:58.600 --> 39:04.127
Welcome. You've got a "message" to the
general public, but not in a bottle?
- Eh, no.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.887
No? Tell us a bit about it.

39:06.960 --> 39:11.843
It concerns a man by the
name of Allan Karlsson-

39:11.920 --> 39:17.207
-who on his hundredth birthday disappeared
from the nursing home in Malmköping.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.365
<i>Wow wow, a hundred years old, I'll</i>
<i>be damned! Is he playing hide and seek?</i>

39:21.440 --> 39:27.448
No. We believe that he's been kidnapped by
a biker gang at the station in Malmköping.

39:27.520 --> 39:30.130
Has he been kidnapped, wow!

39:30.200 --> 39:35.203
Sounds like a bachelor party. Is he getting
remarried to Anna Nicole Smith or what?

39:35.280 --> 39:40.523
We'd be very grateful if the
public could give us any leads.
- Thank you for coming.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.244
- Hello.
- Hey, I'm sitting in my car.

39:47.320 --> 39:54.890
There's some cop on the radio jiving
something about a hundred-year-old
that got kidnapped by a biker gang.

39:54.960 --> 39:59.603
- What the hell are you saying? Kidnapped how?
- It's true. They said so just now on the radio.

39:59.680 --> 40:04.770
<i>- That's got to be The Bolt!</i>
- Fuck me! Now Boltie-boy, you're dead son.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.850
That's good!

40:13.080 --> 40:17.930
- You want something?
- Eh... No, I'm good.

40:19.480 --> 40:25.032
Police suspect: 100-year-old kidnapped by
biker gang; disappeared from nursing home.

40:36.280 --> 40:39.240
Fill up... Pull the lever.

40:39.320 --> 40:46.529
You need to pull the lever, otherwise
there won't be any gas. Pull the lever.

40:46.600 --> 40:53.209
- No…
- You need to pull the lever at the pump!

40:57.640 --> 41:02.042
Have you never fueled a car before?
You need to pull on that little grip
on the handle or else you won't get any.

41:02.120 --> 41:05.801
- Did he kidnap you?
- What? Who?

41:05.880 --> 41:09.408
- Julius!
- No, no. You need to pull on the lever.

41:09.480 --> 41:14.286
The headline says you were
kidnapped by a biker gang.

41:14.360 --> 41:17.648
Julius was wearing a biker vest, I just saw it.

41:17.720 --> 41:24.120
No no, the biker vest is not his.
No no, he took it from that bald little boy.

41:24.200 --> 41:28.001
- A little boy?
- He doesn't need it anymore,
he's dead as a dodo.

41:28.080 --> 41:34.164
- I hit him over the head with a croquet mallet.
- Have you killed him?
- No no, he froze to death.

41:34.240 --> 41:38.729
- Okay...
- The bald little guy...the little bald guy

41:38.800 --> 41:45.080
Han showed up with a sweaty face. He probably
had the runs. He wasn't feeling well.

41:45.160 --> 41:50.043
He thrust the bag in my hand.
There's 50 millions in it.
- What?

41:50.120 --> 41:52.643
Drive! Step on it!

41:52.720 --> 41:56.882
- He doesn't know how to fuel.
- Never mind that, just go! Drive!

41:56.960 --> 42:01.329
Benny, pedal to the metal! Go!
There you go.

42:03.800 --> 42:08.726
- The old bat at the register saw me.
- Saw what?

42:08.800 --> 42:14.163
This here little bag just happened to
fall into my pocket. Would you like a taste?

42:14.240 --> 42:17.648
Yes please.
So, you went shoplifting?

42:17.720 --> 42:20.647
- What the hell?!
- What?

42:22.800 --> 42:27.322
- What the hell's been going on?
- I ask your forgiveness.

42:27.400 --> 42:31.889
Obviously, you working in a kiosk would
get pissed off when I stuff my pocket...

42:31.960 --> 42:37.924
- He can't wreck a budget of
  millions just for a bag of treats.
- I don't care about the candy!

42:38.000 --> 42:41.648
What the hell have you done?!

42:41.720 --> 42:43.489
Huh...?

42:44.480 --> 42:48.489
Never that I'm doing a public appeal on
radio again. It just turns into a mess.

42:48.560 --> 42:52.088
- No, that didn't turn out too well.
- Right, why should I do things like that?

42:52.160 --> 42:57.884
They called from Åkers Styckebruk. The
damn dog indicated corps on the rail trolley.

42:57.960 --> 43:00.724
- Corps?
- Yeah, that's right.

43:03.520 --> 43:09.604
Benny, what do you say? Skip the
traders and come with us instead?

43:09.680 --> 43:13.689
Or do you have an exam on Monday?

43:15.560 --> 43:21.448
- What're you going to do with the money?
- "You?"... We're splitting it right?

43:21.520 --> 43:27.211
Well, we can talk more about that later.
Right now we're parked in a pretty bad place.

43:27.280 --> 43:29.967
Can't you just hit it?

43:30.040 --> 43:34.169
But whose money is it?

43:34.240 --> 43:38.205
You know, it's not our money,
someone else is supposed to have them.

43:38.280 --> 43:44.484
<i>Well, what someone else's? What does</i>
<i>really belong to whom? All things in the</i>
<i>world  changes hands sooner or later.</i>

43:47.000 --> 43:54.405
<i>That shooter I got from Franco, I traded</i>
<i>for a work permit when I got to America.</i>

43:58.320 --> 44:00.843
Hey, Allan!

44:00.920 --> 44:04.088
- You know they're looking for people, right?
- What the hell are you saying, who?

44:04.160 --> 44:08.890
- For the Manhattan project.
- Manhattan? But what? Manhattan project?

44:08.960 --> 44:14.880
Yeah man, the Manhattan project, Allan.
You ask me, we should try to
get us an interview or something.

44:14.960 --> 44:19.886
- You see my fuckin' hammer up there?
- That sounds damn good I can tell you.

44:19.960 --> 44:25.367
- What you say man? Me and you,
can make a change.
- That's very good, that's a good project.

44:25.440 --> 44:29.722
It's time that someone does
something about it. It's bitter.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.367
Bitter? Man what the
fuck you talkin' about?

44:32.440 --> 44:35.367
The Manhattan. Here.

44:36.600 --> 44:41.450
<i>- For fuck's sake...</i>
- You drink it, the Manhattan drink.

44:41.520 --> 44:45.201
- Man, what the hell you mean man?
- It's like kissing an alsatians ass.

44:45.280 --> 44:47.169
It's bitter.

44:47.240 --> 44:50.801
It's a bomb, it's the
biggest bomb on earth.

44:50.880 --> 44:53.130
It's a bomb project?

44:53.200 --> 44:57.602
<i>And in one stroke my</i>
<i>want for blasting came back.</i>

44:57.680 --> 45:02.803
<i>I have to say, it was</i>
<i>a wonderful feeling.</i>

45:03.800 --> 45:08.082
It's not gonna work.
We tried that last week.

45:08.160 --> 45:12.606
- Maybe some coffee will help.
- Thanks!

45:14.200 --> 45:17.968
Still no bomb today I guess?

45:19.720 --> 45:23.008
Mr Oppenheimer, I really must say,
I'm quite disappointed.

45:23.080 --> 45:26.444
Nothing happens here.
No explosions. Nothing.

45:26.520 --> 45:28.683
- You're name's Allan, yeah?
- Allan.

45:28.760 --> 45:33.282
Allen, this is not just any bomb.
We need to figure out some
pretty complicated things here.

45:33.360 --> 45:40.525
No no, you have to keep on testing. You
have to start testing again. As my mother
used to say; "Don't think so much, just do it"

45:40.600 --> 45:46.804
Yeah, but what your mom didn't tell
you is that, to detonate this bomb we need to
solve a minor but crucial fucking problem.

45:48.080 --> 45:54.568
- Yeah, what's the problem?
-Allan... I'm gonna give you a minute, ok?

45:54.640 --> 46:00.888
For what we're going for, we need to use
twice as much plutonium as we're using now.

46:00.960 --> 46:04.041
So, what are you waiting for?

46:04.120 --> 46:10.608
We can't just add twice as
much plutonium, it's unstable, it just
falls apart. It's simple physics.

46:10.680 --> 46:17.080
I know, you've been talking about this for
weeks now. But listen, I give you a minute ok?

46:17.160 --> 46:22.163
I had a little ponder on this. What if
you take half here, and half there-

46:22.240 --> 46:26.041
-and put it together just a few
seconds before the explosion.

46:26.120 --> 46:32.761
Yeah, now, that's the problem. How are
we gonna do that with a falling bomb,
encased in metal, up in the air?

46:32.840 --> 46:36.084
Yeah but, what the hell.
Do you have some dynamite?

46:55.400 --> 46:59.802
<i>Well, it was no trickier</i>
<i>than that to light that candle.</i>

47:01.040 --> 47:05.562
<i>Everyone got very excited.</i>
<i>None more so than Harry.</i>

47:05.640 --> 47:08.491
<i>Yes, Vice President Harry S. Truman.</i>

47:08.560 --> 47:11.564
I'm gonna buy you the
biggest drink you've ever drunk!

47:17.520 --> 47:23.964
- What the.. did my pants get pee-shingles...?
- You've done mankind a great
service my friend.

47:24.040 --> 47:29.567
-You listening to me? You have done...
You have changed the world.
<i>- Tug and shake all you like...</i>

47:29.640 --> 47:33.168
-You have changed the world for the better.
<i>-...the last drop wins the fight.</i>

47:33.240 --> 47:39.881
I'm telling you...listen to me! There'll be
no more wars after this invention of yours.

47:39.960 --> 47:43.401
Thanks to you my friend...

47:43.480 --> 47:46.090
Boom!

47:46.160 --> 47:52.048
America and the world will never have
to fight again because people will know
the power, the awesome power...

47:52.120 --> 47:55.244
Gentlemen, I'm sorry to interrupt you.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.930
- Mr Truman.
- What is it?

47:58.000 --> 48:02.085
There's a phone call.
It's a phone call you have to take.

48:02.160 --> 48:05.961
I've got to take this.
Never go into politics!

48:06.040 --> 48:08.530
Yello!

48:08.600 --> 48:14.367
<i>A boozed up American can</i>
<i>talk the ear off of anyone. Lord knows.</i>

48:15.800 --> 48:20.563
<i>It takes a whole lot to stop them,</i>
<i>things like a president dropping dead.</i>

48:20.640 --> 48:24.649
Jesus Christ!
Alright, I'll be right there.

48:24.720 --> 48:29.723
<i>But that's precisely what</i>
<i>Roosevelt went and did that day.</i>

48:31.960 --> 48:34.123
Now... Here!

48:35.200 --> 48:39.602
Hey, Haar..Harry! You forgot your...

48:39.680 --> 48:42.684
It's a Vice Presidential lighter.
You keep it.

48:42.760 --> 48:47.206
<i>Well Harry wasn't too picky</i>
<i>about whose was whose.</i>

48:49.240 --> 48:51.370
Welcome back!

48:51.440 --> 48:55.241
-Mr Karlsson. -Yes, Allan.
-Welcome back to Sweden!

48:55.320 --> 48:59.449
Nonono, Prime Minister Erlander
wants to offer a welcome-dinner.

48:59.520 --> 49:05.680
<i>I barely managed to get my feet on the</i>
<i>ground before I was shanghaied to that</i>
<i>schmooze dinner at the Grand Hotel.</i>

49:05.760 --> 49:09.245
<i>That suited me well after</i>
<i>that damned airline food.</i>

49:09.320 --> 49:12.488
- Oh great, because I'm quite peckish.
- You'd better get in quickly!

49:12.560 --> 49:18.327
<i>Retelling a story;</i>
The soldier got up and said:
"Get down, geezers and grannies,
he's reloading!"

49:25.000 --> 49:31.729
Oh right, I heard from no less than Harry
S. Truman that Allan is an exceedingly
decent chap and that he also
performed great services for America.

49:31.800 --> 49:36.803
- Well, I don't know, but, we
had one hell of a party!
- But you have to tell me, I'm very curious!

49:36.880 --> 49:40.845
We sat... we drank tequila.
Loads of tequila.

49:40.920 --> 49:44.361
Obviously I speak of what transpired before.

49:44.440 --> 49:50.568
No, before, we drank only tequila, all the way.
Harry wanted bourbon, that's just sissy stuff.

49:50.640 --> 49:54.004
Mr Karlsson has to realize that
it's the work that I'm referring to.

49:54.080 --> 50:00.961
Oh, you're thinking of when I worked on
Manhattan? Then you're not allowed tequila!
That's totally reckless.
It goes straight to your head.

50:01.040 --> 50:06.928
You'll have to excuse me gentlemen, I've
got to go. It's very interesting but the
government calls, my wife that is!

50:09.200 --> 50:13.602
That's it. The check's on me.
You can brief engineer
Eklund some more. Enjoy!

50:13.680 --> 50:16.323
Well... Bye bye.

50:18.080 --> 50:22.689
- Well the Prime Minister has asked me...
- Hey, you think he's coming back?

50:22.760 --> 50:27.566
- No.
- Then I'll grab this piece of meat.

50:27.640 --> 50:32.566
- It'd be a shame if it went to waste.
- The Prime Minister has asked me to...

50:32.640 --> 50:39.084
...ask around if perhaps there'd be a
job for you at the atomic energy company.

50:39.160 --> 50:43.289
- How nice!
- If we begin with your schooling...

50:43.360 --> 50:46.801
Well, that's not too much to brag about.
Just three years.

50:46.880 --> 50:52.888
- Just three years of academic studies?!
- Yeah, I dropped out when I was nine.

50:52.960 --> 50:57.810
- Nine?
- Yes, exactly. Or no, I was ten.

50:57.880 --> 51:03.571
No wait, I was turning ten that year,
so I was nine when I left school.

51:05.040 --> 51:10.491
Hey you, here's a little guy who wants to jump
down into the basement. You can take his.

51:10.560 --> 51:14.405
<i>That Eklund disappeared</i>
<i>quicker than a chicken shits.</i>

51:14.480 --> 51:20.760
<i>But he wasn't the only one at the Grand</i>
<i>who was out fishing, to put it that way.</i>

51:23.360 --> 51:28.210
Good evening, Mr. Karlsson.
I'm Popov, Jurij Popov.

51:28.280 --> 51:31.361
I'm a physicist. We are colleagues.

51:32.760 --> 51:38.484
Maybe we should take walk, together?
It seems like we need some fresh air.

51:38.560 --> 51:41.444
What the hell, a walk?

51:44.240 --> 51:47.321
- Hey Popov!
- Coming.

51:47.400 --> 51:52.163
Hey hey hey hey. Little lady, there's
some nice stuff here. Grönstedts...

51:52.240 --> 51:56.008
- You know what? I'll take a schnapps.
Hey, you pay for this. Give her a fifty.

51:56.080 --> 52:02.088
- How much?
- Fifty.

52:02.160 --> 52:04.683
Wow, this one had some spunk to it.

52:04.760 --> 52:08.321
Now it's starting to take hold.
I feel awesome!

52:09.920 --> 52:15.567
No Allan, we just like you to share some
of your experience and knowledge with us.

52:15.640 --> 52:19.288
- Uh-huh, you don't say?
- It could be very lucrative for you.

52:19.360 --> 52:25.640
- But..eh, but why?
- Comrade Stalin is a very nice man.

52:25.720 --> 52:28.527
Well, I just like to blow up things.

52:28.600 --> 52:32.128
- Yes, I like this too!
- You, you do?

52:32.200 --> 52:34.647
Yes.

52:34.720 --> 52:40.968
Just give me some dynamite and I blow up
anything. Fuckin' shit?!

52:41.040 --> 52:43.443
Damn!

52:47.720 --> 52:51.368
What the hell is this doing here?
This's inshore of the inner archipelago.

52:54.120 --> 52:56.730
We're running low on gas.

52:56.800 --> 53:00.645
- Go in here!
- Yeah, do that.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.730
Sjötorp? That sounds jaunty!

53:21.840 --> 53:25.849
- Hello!
- Hey, hey?

53:27.000 --> 53:31.162
We're wondering if we might possibly be
able to rent a room here for the night?

53:31.240 --> 53:34.604
Well this is no god damn hotel.
I live in here!

53:34.680 --> 53:39.770
But we'll pay handsomly.
Money's a plenty, that's not an issue.

53:41.000 --> 53:47.881
- Uh-huh, but hell, are you on the lam.
- There's not need for concern.
I understand that it seems strange.

53:47.960 --> 53:53.968
- Huh! There's yet another little old man.
- We got a little lost driving, and...

53:54.040 --> 53:57.087
...we'd be very grateful if
that could be arranged.

53:57.160 --> 53:59.890
- Allan.
- Hi! Gunilla.
- Pleasure.

53:59.960 --> 54:02.090
Well, we'll see about that.

54:02.160 --> 54:07.731
Ah, I guess I'll have to squeeze you in.
 Just as long as no one pees themselves,
then you'll have to sleep in the barn.

54:09.400 --> 54:12.721
- What's that?
- Well, that's Sonja.

54:19.600 --> 54:22.167
What's this then?

54:24.160 --> 54:27.885
Aha! Hey there.

54:29.720 --> 54:31.730
That wasn't too bad.

54:31.800 --> 54:34.126
There, there!

54:35.160 --> 54:37.650
Come, Sonja!

54:52.280 --> 54:55.841
Is she about 40 years old?

54:55.920 --> 54:59.721
Sonja? I haven't got a clue actually.

54:59.800 --> 55:04.409
- Why would you think that?
- I'm almost a zoologist, seems
about right, I think.

55:04.480 --> 55:07.604
Almost? How the hell can you almost be?

55:07.680 --> 55:14.321
Well, one is almost
done with the education.

55:14.400 --> 55:18.048
- But where did you find her?
- At a circus.

55:18.120 --> 55:23.811
- Aha! Does she know different tricks?
- I really haven't got a damned clue.

55:23.880 --> 55:28.686
- Circuses are nothing but cruelty to animals.
- Yeah, absolutely!

55:28.760 --> 55:33.730
- I hate circuses too.
- That was the one good thing my ex did.

55:33.800 --> 55:39.163
He realized that I felt sorry for her,
so he took the matter into his own hands

55:54.760 --> 55:56.890
He just took her?

55:56.960 --> 56:01.526
- Took? Doesn't an elephant own itself?
- Yeah...

56:10.840 --> 56:13.287
- Allan! - Huh?
- Listen now...!

56:13.360 --> 56:16.090
You can't do that!

56:16.160 --> 56:20.923
- Stop, whoa whoa whoa!
- I think there's not enough oomph!

56:21.000 --> 56:23.043
It's supposed to taste of barbecue.

56:23.120 --> 56:25.567
<i>- What the hell is that?</i>
<i>- A french potato salad.</i>

56:25.640 --> 56:30.042
<i>Yeah well, I could see that but that</i>
<i>green gunk. That looked tasty!</i>

56:30.120 --> 56:32.927
It's guacamole.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.643
- Are you almost a chef too?
- No, almost a dietician.

56:37.720 --> 56:41.488
No, stop it. You're kidding me!

56:41.560 --> 56:47.044
No, unfortunately I'm almost very
many things. Almost a veterinarian...

56:47.120 --> 56:52.931
Almost a macroeconomist, almost a
pharmacist, almost a behaviourist.

56:53.000 --> 56:58.691
Damn! You almost have to be single too.
You couldn't have had time for a woman
if you've been going on like that.

56:58.760 --> 57:02.802
No. Or-yes...

57:02.880 --> 57:06.922
Well, I'm single. I'm available.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.326
- Or were you kidding?
- No, but you've got to be kidding me?

57:11.400 --> 57:19.362
No, not kidding. I've spent the last
18 years getting 550 college credits.

57:19.440 --> 57:23.809
- Holy hell!
- I've had it tough trying
to quench my thirst for knowledge.

57:23.880 --> 57:29.003
You've got to stop lying to yourself.
It can all go to shit otherwise.

57:29.080 --> 57:34.968
- Ain't nothing turning into anything.
- Well that's one analysis one can make.

57:35.040 --> 57:39.289
What the hell?
What the fuck are you doing here?

57:41.240 --> 57:44.768
- What?
- What are you doing here?

57:44.840 --> 57:47.210
Eh...

57:47.280 --> 57:51.048
- I was just going to pick up some stuff.
- You have no things to pick up here!

57:51.120 --> 57:55.522
Yeah, I have...
I was going to pick up my bowls.

57:55.600 --> 57:59.609
- What fucking bowls?
- The blue fucking bowl
with some floral pattern.

57:59.680 --> 58:03.645
God damn it Ricky, you gave me those
for my birthday. Are you getting them?

58:03.720 --> 58:06.287
I've changed my mind. I want my bowls.

58:06.360 --> 58:10.762
Go fuck yourself Ricky! Get lost!
You're not supposed to be here.

58:12.240 --> 58:15.965
- Pleasant to fuck with?
- Yes, he's pleasant.

58:16.040 --> 58:19.241
- He's the best. Real fuckin' nice.
- Yeah yeah, sure.

58:19.320 --> 58:24.246
- He's very good with his hands.
"Making love" we call it.
- Ricky. Hi! Congrats.

58:24.320 --> 58:28.001
- Thank you...
- Take care!

58:36.040 --> 58:38.804
No, you'll have to turn around.

58:38.880 --> 58:41.731
Yes, there you go!

58:42.960 --> 58:47.242
Yes. No... Yeah, that works.
A bit more...

58:47.320 --> 58:52.804
- You'll have to... There you go.
- You can back it up here.

58:52.880 --> 58:57.730
- You're doing fine.
- If you back it up a bit more...

58:57.800 --> 59:01.645
There you go.

59:01.720 --> 59:05.325
Man, he was riding the clutch.

59:06.320 --> 59:10.208
Gunilla, Gunilla!

59:11.440 --> 59:17.164
I don't know what the hell is wrong
with me. I always meet idiots like that.
I'm drawn to those idiots!

59:17.240 --> 59:21.445
Maybe you'll know.
You're probably almost a psychologist.

59:21.520 --> 59:26.610
No, not fully...
But I don't have that much further.

59:26.680 --> 59:33.289
I've taken the basic courses.
I still have neuropsychology
to do, but that's just a short one.

59:33.360 --> 59:39.368
But it's hard to say
where your problem stems from.

59:39.440 --> 59:43.645
But you can change your behavioural
pattern...if you want.

59:43.720 --> 59:47.762
But, Benny. You can't
choose who you fall in love with.

59:48.880 --> 59:51.086
No, unfortunately...

59:51.160 --> 59:56.611
Gunilla! It was you and me.
You and me...

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.809
- Yes, hello?
- Bro!

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.441
- Hello, Ricky?
- She's left me, it's over.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:26.167
- She's met someone else.
- Ricky listen, nevermind that damn broad!

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.528
It's not a damn broad, it's Gunilla!

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:36.241
Listen to me now, don't do any more
valiums and give up the drink too.
We'll deal with this crap tomorrow.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.284
I can't do this. It's all done!
She's screwing that damn centenarian.
I'm sure of it!

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.205
What did you say? Stop, stop.
What centenarian?

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:53.281
- Did you see the centenarian?
- That damn geezer that was on TV
who's a hundred years old!

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.364
<i>But Ricky...</i>

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:05.970
Well... Two days ago I was sat alone
in my kitchen flipping a matchbox.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.804
Then all of a sudden this old guy shows
up, and now I'm sitting here. Huh?!

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.644
It's god damn wonderful!

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.084
<i>Well, one thing sure</i>
<i>leads to another alright.</i>

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.447
<i>But whether one thing is better</i>
<i>than the other, well, that's</i>
<i>something you can't be sure of.</i>

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.928
<i>But one thing I do know, is that</i>
<i>submarines, propeller-planes and vodka-</i>

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.287
<i>-leads to an upset stomach.</i>
<i>You'd better believe it...</i>

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.370
Oh fuck me!

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.170
Allan come on. Sorry, what did you say?

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.921
First we wanted
Albert Einstein to help us.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.250
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, yes.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.646
Well we found Mr Einstein.
KGB picked him up in Geneva.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.603
Is it my bachelor party? How exciting!

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.606
Wait, I'm not getting married.
I don't even have a girlfriend.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:05.168
<i>We found later out that he was</i>
<i>Herbert Einstein, Albert's idiot brother.</i>
- A bomb?!

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.762
<i>Herbert Einsteins didn't share much</i>
<i>more than the looks with his brother.</i>

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.567
Comrade Stalin was very,
kind of, disappointed.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.841
Well, you can believe that!

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:26.441
- So we put our trust in you, Allan.
- The factory in Siberia is not working!

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.605
Who's responsible for it?

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.645
Idiots! Fools!

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:41.560
It's not so good with marble
when you have a headache.
Marble - headache - he's screaming.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.207
Who's responsible?

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.368
Comrade Stalin want's you to tell him
everything you know about the nuclear bomb

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.410
Uh-huh, you don't say.
- Yeah, sure sure. Why not?

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.729
But maybe a little, a drink first?

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.843
What the hell's he saying? Kalashnikov?

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:32.840
- One drink and then you tell me everything!
- That's the spirit! Good!

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.001
Dance, dance!

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.527
Come on, dance!

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.963
Damn, you're nagging, stop it.
You're insane.
You sound like...just like Franco.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.529
- Franco... The fascist?
- Always nagging... It gets old.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.647
What's he saying?

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:04.924
- You know Franco?
- Yes yes, I... I saved his life.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.086
No no, your dance...beautiful!
Very good. More masculine.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.250
Franco he was dancing, you know, like
this, like a woman.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.489
- You may say your last words.
- Exactly, listen.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.886
I don't think that men
should dance at all.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.726
Just woman.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.247
<i>We don't all think the same, but...</i>

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:47.290
<i>...that a gulag camp is a real rat-hole</i>
<i>is something most would agree on.</i>

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.849
<i>But then again I got to</i>
<i>meet some new people too.</i>

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.803
<i>Some just briefly...but it was there</i>
<i>that I became friends with Herbert!</i>

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.009
<i>You know, Herbert Einstein.</i>
<i>Like I said, one thing leads to another.</i>

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.449
- Hey, idiot! Put the stone back.
- Yeah, yeah...

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.846
Idiot.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.606
- Hello.
- Hello!

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.726
<i>And the food there, or the feed...</i>
<i>It was lousy.</i>

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.606
<i>And I never saw a drop of vodka.</i>
<i>Not one little shot came my way.</i>

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.728
<i>I decided on day, to get away.</i>

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:38.409
<i>I had a good plan.</i>
<i>Herbert was the only one who could</i>
<i>roam around freely without getting shot-</i>

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.123
<i>-because the guards had gotten used to</i>
<i>him getting lost and strayed all the time.</i>

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:48.050
You pretend that you are going to the
canteen, but you end up in the laundry.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.369
-There you steal two uniforms.
- Go to the canteen?

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:57.410
No, no, but...no.
You <i>pretend</i> to go to the canteen.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:03.051
But you end up in the laundry.
The guards, they think that
you're going to the canteen.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.642
- So I go to the canteen?
- You go...to the laundry!

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:15.410
The laundry? Why I go to the laundry?
The feeding, the food is in the canteen.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:21.400
This is god damned ludicrous!
Listen, you go to the laundry by mistake.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.326
To get the steak?

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.562
- So we eat before we escape?
- What? No!

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.922
- But we go to the canteen?
- But Herbert, listen.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.009
We go to the canteen everyday, to eat.
But you're not going to the canteen.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.368
You're going to the laundry
to steal two uniforms.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.563
- I see. That's the plan!
- Yes, exactly.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:50.768
Allan we're in the canteen, the canteen!
We made it! We made it Allan!

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:56.607
<i>After a year I gave up. I realized that my</i>
<i>plan was much too complicated for Herbert.</i>

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.170
Herbert, let's drop it. Forget it!

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.041
Aw shit! Where did I put it?

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.369
Herbert, for Pete's sake, give it up.
Please. Try to get some sleep.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.204
- I cannot find the pin!
- Pin, what damned pin? For what?

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:14.125
- The pin for this!
- But that's a hand grenade!

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.805
- When did you find this?
- Ah maybe a year ago.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.528
- Come on. Where did you find it?
- I found it in the laundry.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.681
- You've been to the laundry?
- I went there by mistake.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.720
You have to understand.
You have to throw it away.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.367
- Who goes there?
-Halt!

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:35.967
Sorry, we have a problem.
We have an unsafe hand grenade here.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.410
Throw it!

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.090
Grenade!

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.450
Now it's gone.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:00.530
<i>I can tell you that loose rockets</i>
<i>behave like cats' willies in March.</i>

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.488
<i>They fly every which way.</i>

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.561
- I think we should go now.
- To the laundry?

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.687
No, look here, we can take this.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.682
Here.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:25.885
<i>The fire is spreading</i>
<i>across the military base</i>

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:34.689
<i>Stalin took the news of the gulag</i>
<i>camp and the whole damn pacific</i>
<i>fleet burning to a cinder very hard.</i>

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.770
<i>He kicked the bucket.</i>

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.406
Shove him in the bathtub, flush the
fucker, make him talk!

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:45.761
Pull him out of the bedroom
and drag the bastard into the
bathroom and douse the bastard.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.691
- Get it together for fuck's sake!
- Oww!

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.365
- Out with the address!
Where does she live?
- Oww!

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:56.001
- Get it together! Where
does the bitch live?
- Sjötorp (Lake cottage)...

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.089
...because it's situated so
beautifully next to a lake.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:04.169
- <i>Pike</i> did you hear that?
- Pedal to the metal <i>Bucket</i>! Let's roll!

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.368
The amplifier is not working,
I haven't had if for that long.
The warrant is still valid.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:11.804
Of course I'll bring it in. Thanks!

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:19.279
Hey, I was thinking about those
cadaver-dogs. How can we be so
sure that they always indicate corpses?

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:23.402
- How do you mean? It's a corps-dog.
- Well yeah, but...

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:29.084
I don't know, but, I'm thinking that
Allan is 100 years old after all.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.649
- And what?
- Yeah but, senior people smell
somewhat different to what we do.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:38.089
A sweet, sweetish kind of smell.
It's a little, kind of...

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.568
...somewhat "corpsy."

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:46.846
- Forget it.
- Mhum, I think so.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:51.049
I want you to check out these guys.
Per Gunnar "The Pike" Gärdin
och Hans "The Bucket" Claesson.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.729
- But I've got my hands
    full with the centenarian.
-But it's the same bikers; "Never again"

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.881
- Didn't you read the entire report?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course I have!

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.450
<i>Did you choke on something?</i>

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.207
There you go!

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.284
- What the hell?
<i>- Have some vegetables too.</i>

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.882
I found this cell phone on
the kitchen floor. Is it yours?

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.766
- No, it's not mine.
- It wasn't Gunilla's either.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:55.843
- The thing is, it's turned off.
- Well, turn it on and you'll
see who's called.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:03.282
- Then you'll find out whose it is.
-Yeah, but can one do that?

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.768
- There you go.
- Thanks.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.565
Someone called "Oleg"
who has called. "Oleg" again.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.162
His name is Alec, it's Russian.
Little-Popov has called.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.927
- Is it you cell phone, Allan?
- Yes, it doesn't look any better.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.288
- Yes,
- Hey, I've found the geezer.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.286
- Damn good. Do you have the bag too?
- No, I haven't seen any damn bag yet.
There's just a load of people here.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.762
- Just find that bag and quick!
- Eh, yeah, ok...

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.968
- "Mm eh" what "ok"? Is there a problem?
- No, I'm just thinking about
the fuckin' geezer.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:43.004
- What the hell am I to do with him?
- Don't think, just do what you do: Threaten!
- Ok, I'll just threaten.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.565
This is a threat!

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:51.326
Anyone does anything,
I'll blow their heads off, get it?
The bag! Get out the bag!

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.568
The bag, it's in the room, the kitchen.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.086
- Hey faggot, get the bag, quick!
- Do you mean me?

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.245
I said "faggot". Hurry up!
I'll shoot the old man.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.441
And you up there, keep calm!

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.770
Quickly!

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.960
Stop, stay there!

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.044
Back away from the bag. Back away.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.610
- Hello!
<i>- Hello? Why's it taking so damn long?</i>

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.640
- Did you find the bag?
- I've got the bag in my hand now.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.161
- Great! Do you have the green?
- I'm checking it, I'm checking it now.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:38.603
You all take it easy, easy-peasy!
- Good, faggot! You stay calm.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:41.290
Nice and calm!

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:46.682
- It's a damn crappy bag, all plastic.
- Shut it, fucking raisin!

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.650
- God damn, loads a'cash!
-Good <i>Bucket</i>!

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.963
- Take that damn bag, and its content
and get your ass over here quick!
- Get out of here, you bastard!

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.803
- Stop bitch! I'll shoot you.
- Hey, I'm the one shooting! I live here.
- Stop I said!

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.730
- <i>Bucket</i>, god damnit, what are you doing?
- Get lost, I'll blow your head off!

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.923
- Fuck! Shit!
- <i>Bucket</i> ?

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.247
Shit! No...

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.802
Caracas, god damnit! Get up.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.884
Hey, you're screaming.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.608
- Where the hell have you been to?
- Bought melons. We were out.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.885
But, <i>the Bucket</i> just got capped by that damned
centenarian, and you just up and leave?

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.526
- Are you joking?
- You think I'm joking?! Does it look
like I'm joking? Is that what's going on?

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.609
Half the damned crew and 50 million
are gone, and you're buying fruit!

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.842
- Melon is not a fruit, it's a vegetable.
- I don't give a flying fuck!

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.442
That's not what it's about. Never question
me the way you do now. You got that?

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.808
I won't.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.883
Where're you off to? Stop I said!
Where the fuck are you going?
You're not going anywhere!

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.767
Stay for fuck's sake!

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.646
Shit!

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.081
I'm gonna cut... There.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.884
- Did you get all the bullets out?
- I think the last one went straight through.
Sorry, I should have done something before.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.122
What you should have done, was to inform
me about all the god damn stolen money!

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.685
- Now I'm all mixed up in this!
- But it isn't really my money just yet.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.408
- It hasn't been decided if I get a share.
- Yes Benny, you are in! Help me here!

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.681
- So he's in?
- You're in too, Gunilla.
You'll get a buck too.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.451
A buck? I'm just as involved in this mess as
you lot. A fourth will do, thank you very much!

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.601
- The sun's bearing down.
Do you want to come for a swim?
- No!

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:05.001
- Julius, shouldn't we take a dip?
- No, god damn it!

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.931
- Sonja might want a bath.
- No, she's not going to bathe.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.402
- What are we doing with him?
- Maybe set the car on fire?

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.325
- Eh, let him lay.
- But, someone needs to do something with him!

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.283
I guess that will be me, since I'm the
only one who accepts any sort of
damn responsibility around here!

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.603
Responsibility? So it's your sense
of responsibility that makes
this place feel so safe right now?

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:32.923
- Hey, it wasn't me who was
waving around a shooter just then.
- What was I to do?
He was about to blow our heads off!

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.444
- Hey, let's try to hurry up a bit, so
we can get out of here?
- I'm going for a swim, call me
on this if there's anything.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:45.724
- But where are we to pick you up if you
are going to set the car on fire?
- I don't know yet!

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:51.087
Driving around with a dead guy...
I don't even know who he is!

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.890
<i>Well, you can never be sure of that.</i>

01:15:53.960 --> 01:16:00.164
<i>People can look like one thing, and</i>
<i>then turn out to be someone else.</i>

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:05.726
<i>In Paris, spring of -68,</i>
<i>I went to a party-</i>

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.885
<i>-with Herbert and his pretty little wife.</i>

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:13.281
<i>It was at the French</i>
<i>Minister of Foreign Affairs.</i>

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:18.570
- Your majesty, good evening and welcome!
- This is my husband Herbert.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.408
- And his friend Allan Karlsson.
- Welcome to our place.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.364
No, Jean-Claude, not now.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:29.088
But look, it's you.
Are you trying to hide?

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.649
- What are you doing here?
- Apologies, have we met before?

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.646
- You know each other?
- No no, he's confusing me with someone else.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:44.760
- Jean-Claude Pistou,
my interpreter at the embassy.
- No no, this is Vladimir Karpov.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.723
Better watch out for this guy,
he's a real party animal.
We had a big party with Stalin.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.323
Lots of vodka we drank, damn we had fun.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:59.124
- Who are you?
- You know very well who I am!

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:10.370
<i>Vladimir had not only gotten dressed up</i>
<i>for the evening, he'd been playing</i>
<i>dress-up for years at the ministers'.</i>

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.204
<i>That made the French a little talkative.</i>

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.131
Give us a name!

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:20.122
<i>And Ryan Hutten</i>
<i>of the French CIA-office...</i>

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:23.925
<i>...he became a little curious too.</i>

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.088
So, how do you know this Vladimir?

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.726
- Mr Popov, he put us together.
- Popov, Jurij Popov, the physicist?

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:40.251
Yeah, we had this party with Stalin and
Kirov and this KGB-guy, Alexander.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:43.881
They danced like, you know cossack dance.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:47.161
I don't think men should dance, actually.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:51.402
But maybe if I get
real drunk I prefer a "snoa".

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.724
Or a "polska" (slow walking dances).
"Polska" is good. Real pleasant.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:58.688
Rather a snoa. Snoa is good dance.
It's quite quick.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.643
I get the picture, Allan. So eh, you know
a lot of people and you're very sociable.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.090
- Yeah.
- So, you willing to help us?

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.885
Yeah sure, are you...are you in trouble?

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.004
Thanks!

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:25.409
- I'm looking for Popov.
- He's over there.

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.444
Old-mans-grip!

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.922
Have you started using
the "old-mans-grip"?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.926
But look... What are you doing here?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.605
It's been a long time...? May I?

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.804
American cowboy boots.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.081
- This is my son, Oleg.
- Oh yeah, your boy?

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.769
- Are they real American boots?
- Yes, they're nice.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.849
- Can I have them? Please.
- Oleg, quit it.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:09.327
- He can have my...
- Take this, it's also American.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.724
No, you don't have to...

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.963
- Now, what do you say?
- Thanks.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.688
Yeah yeah, that's alright.
Enjoy it in good health.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.321
Dear friend, what brings you to Moscow?

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:31.206
Well, CIA has a problem,
so they asked me for help.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.610
I was thinking that you might...
What the hell is this?

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.323
- Wash your hands.
- I have done!

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.404
Wash them again!

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:51.007
My friend, I really would like to help.
I cannot do that. I've got a family now.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.806
Why not?

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.725
If I steal some secret information,
they kill me and my family.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:00.842
Just talk to the people in Kreml?

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:05.125
The KGB must damn well have something laying
there that they want to, you know, get rid of?

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.003
I apologize my friend!

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.890
Ryan Hutten?
So you're meeting the CIA in Paris?

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.925
Can you get some
interesting information from them?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.447
It's not unlikely.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.005
<i>Hutten was happy with</i>
<i>that crap the Russians sent.</i>

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:36.323
- Now, how much money does this guy want?
- No-no, no money, just...

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.601
Just give him some of your information.

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.283
- Counter intel.
- That'd work really well, Allan.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.605
<i>All of a sudden, I was a double agent.</i>

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:58.124
<i>Well agent, I don't know about spying. There</i>
<i>never was anything classified in that bag.</i>

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:03.170
<i>Both the Ruskies and the Yanks</i>
<i>emptied their trash bins straight into it.</i>

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.404
<i>Still, things got in motion anyway.</i>

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:11.926
<i>There were even a few</i>
<i>who snuffed it, unfortunately.</i>

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.850
<i>But then again, that's what</i>
<i>people do in cold wars.</i>

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.003
Hey, the bag...

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.482
Really, you don't say?

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:19.448
<i>People often appear one way, but then they</i>
<i>turn out to be someone completely different.</i>

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:26.330
<i>Americas' new president Ronald Reagan,</i>
<i>he seemed like a real rascal.</i>

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.846
<i>Well, he was one too,</i>
<i>so maybe that doesn't apply to all.</i>

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.929
It's the same button for the start and stop
of the recording of sound. You toggle it.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.523
Toggle? English please.

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.401
You tell him Allan, I can't stand all this
technological doohickey stuff either.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.724
Why can't he use a normal
tape recorder like anybody else?

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:51.441
- Mr President, Sir? A moment of your time?
- Start...and stop.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:56.403
- If we get rid of the wall, the
roses will get more sun.
- You're always bugging me about that wall!

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.205
The wall stays.
Do you understand me, motherfucker?

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.284
<i>You're always bugging</i>
<i>me about that wall!</i>

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:07.161
<i>The wall stays.</i>
<i>Do you understand me, motherfucker?</i>

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.725
<i>I don't want any nasty</i>
<i>critters invading my garden</i>

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:16.284
<i>I'm the fucking president. For the last</i>
<i>time: Don't tear down that wall!</i>

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.441
This recording...

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.769
...confirms what I've always suspected.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:29.970
He's scared shitless at the thought
that we'd tear down the wall.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:33.601
He knows that if we do-

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.564
-the Russians will invade the world-

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:41.370
-and take over without weapons.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:51.044
<i>When my old friend Popov died, I</i>
<i>put my briefcase on the shelf for good.</i>

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.650
<i>But his son would come</i>
<i>over to visit sometimes.</i>

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:59.122
To tear down such a big wall
with just hammers and chisels...

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.647
It's a crying shame.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.123
- Here's to dad!
- Cheers!

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:13.240
Incredible! They've got
cannons all along the east block,
and they're chipping away like that.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:30.082
What's this...? Hello?

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.486
Do people stop answering their phone
when they turn a hundred?

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.650
- Is it Oleg?
- You should always have
the cell phone with you.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.887
- Well...
- Ok, sorry.

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.128
Congratulations! What are you up to?

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.881
- I'm about to take an afternoon swim.
- Afternoon swim?

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:57.284
You're cool as always. Were you
celebrated? What are you doing tonight?

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:03.127
Apparently we're fleeing here,
however that came about.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.967
- Fleeing?
- Yeah, people have died and...
and so we are fleeing.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:15.769
- What the hell Benny, hurry! We need to bail!
- We need to pack food and clothes.

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.407
- Did Julius call yet?
- No, he hasn't.

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.570
Ow!

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.804
- Did you find something?
- Eh, what?

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.840
- Regarding the centenarian.
- No, no, no-no-no...

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:41.409
We just learned that "<i>The Bucket</i>"
Claesson has a brother nearby here.

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:46.964
Ricky is his name. He's seen the
centenarian at some place called Sjötorp.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:50.361
- Check it out.
- Sure.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:59.689
I want my bag, here,
in Bali, by tomorrow.

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:06.489
But first I'm going to Sjötorp.
I'm going there myself,
understand, no assistance.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:13.004
- I cut the ankle monitor. It's gone.
- Shut up! Just get Bali into your thick head.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.488
Understand? Bali?
Otherwise you're gonna be food.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:20.208
I'll serve you up as confit
at your own fuckin' funeral dinner.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:25.283
Uh-huh... Food I don't understand.
What, why food?

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.565
- Nonono, you will be the fuckin' food.
- I...I am food?

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:35.648
You will be the food, because we would
have killed you, cooked you and fuckin'
would have served you up!

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:43.163
Fuckin' hell, goddammit! - Nonono, not
you, I was almost hitting car in bus.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:48.210
<i>- Oh Jesus Christ! Can't you</i>
<i>even drive a fuckin' car?</i>
- I'll be back.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.526
- Is he a Russian then, Oleg?
- Oleg, yes, he's a Russian.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.046
- He's travelling all over the world.
- Do you have any credentials for him?

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:10.167
Credentials? Well it's Popov's son.
I've known him a long time.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.648
Isn't it enough presently,
that he wants to help us?

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:18.483
Or do you know any PhD
that you'd rather call? Someone
who wrote a thesis concerning this?

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.530
"Hunted by terrible biker gang"
for 90 college credits.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.604
Damned idiot flailing <i>behind us</i>...
Damn narrow road...

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.726
How fucking hard can it be...
Let's see here.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.487
<i>Fuck you!</i>

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.604
Holy hell, look at how he's driving!

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.843
- What the hell's he doing?
- Brake!

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.163
What the hell?!

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.528
Now the merry-go-rounds are turning.
Damn, he was airborne.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.843
- Is that all?
- Eh...a gas can.

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.847
- With gas.
- Do you have your own can?

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.124
- No.
- Uh-huh.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.084
- And a lighter.
- Yeah, one of those?

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.284
Yes. We're having a barbecue too.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.767
Meat. I'm mad about barbecuing.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:49.449
- It's the time of year for that now.
- Yes, that's true.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.610
But what?! Shit!

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.924
God damn it!

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.207
He doesn't seem too talkative.
That's a shame, he seemed so eager.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.770
Shit!

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:15.242
- Is he alive or what?
- Yes, but he's bleeding a lot from his head.

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.570
Hello!

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.210
Argh...

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:35.161
But what the hell is this...

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:50.803
- Get in quickly, for Pete's sake!
- What the hell's with people?

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:56.364
Swiping someone's car in broad daylight,
They should be locked up!

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.968
He'll get damned surprised
when he opens up the trunk.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:04.966
- Is there no gauze or something...?
- You'll have to use a curtain or something.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.044
- I can't use something dirty.
It has to be clean.
- Who's that?

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:11.965
- He was run over.
- But who is it?

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:17.207
- He's lying there bleeding.
- Can't anyone say who he is?

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.568
- He was trying to shoot at us.
- Yes, he did!

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:27.249
- When he wakes up he's getting his damn bag.
- Give away 50 million?!

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:33.240
- Are you stupid, or what?
- This never ends. He was about
to shoot us! It's not worth it.

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:38.323
- Allan, they want to give away our money.
- It damn well isn't our money!

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:43.086
Where are we supposed to go now?
- Can you call that Oleg-guy now, Allan?

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:49.648
I found blood, and in my hand I have an
empty casing. A gun cartridge.

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:52.767
Fired? Yes.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:58.127
What? Well of course
you'll have to send forensics.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.441
He's waking up now.

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:08.209
There, here's you damned bag and
you'll have to leave us alone now!

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:14.362
- What?
- You're getting your bag that you've
been searching high and low for.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:19.170
There, we're not calling the cops, just
go and leave us alone.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:24.527
- My bag?
- The last thing that happened
was that you pursued us...

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:29.002
I think the three of us
should have a little talk now.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.527
Just a moment.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:38.162
It is <i>memoria damnum</i>, amnesia.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.965
- Shit!
- There was plenty of that at the home.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.448
- And bedsores.
- How long does one of
these "damn-memos" last?

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:50.370
<i>Memoria damnum</i>...
It could be hours or days.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:54.405
- The rest of his life if he's unlucky.
- We'll put him here and the bag too.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:00.324
I'm not giving away 50 million to
someone who doesn't even know it's his!

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.885
That's where the line is drawn!

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.884
- Well, hello.
<i>- Nevermind about the fuckin' hellos!</i>

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:20.000
- What exactly are you up to there "Gäddan"?
- Do you know, who I am?

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.242
<i>If I know who you are? </i> Yes I do!
Do YOU know who I am?

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:29.006
- No. Who are you?
- Don't you fuckin' screw with me!

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:33.766
You try and screw with me boy,
<i>you think for one second, and</i>
<i>then I'll fuckin' screw with you!</i>

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:37.084
<i>Upside, downside, sideways,</i>
<i>up your fuckin' arsehole!</i>

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:41.245
<i>Every fuckin' orifice. You think you're</i>
<i>safe 'cause I'll can't go back to Europe?</i>

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.810
- Hello, it's Allan.
- Who?

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.644
This is Allan Karlsson.

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:50.521
<i>- Allan Karlsson</i> ?
-Allan Karlsson from Malmköping.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:54.488
<i>I'll tell you</i> something mate, you and
your fuckin' pals, you are fuckin' dead.
<i>You understand?</i>

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:59.650
Well, if you want to kill me you better
hurry because I'm a hundred years old.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:03.608
You my son, are dead fuckin' meat!
Prick!

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.323
Meat?

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.404
He said I was meat.

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:11.883
Who was it?

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:17.804
Well he never said but.
But he was very careful to express that
he was set to kill, both left and right.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.966
You mean kill us?

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:24.169
I'm gonna fuckin' kill them, that's what
I'm gonna do.
Patsy, get out of that fuckin' water!

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:27.091
Joe, get up!
Joe! Get on your fuckin' feet!

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:31.923
There's some crack lad called Allan Karlsson.
We've got to find out who he is. Get me online.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.287
Yeah yeah, I know orienteers
are trustworthy people-

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:40.801
-but can't you see
that this is pointless.

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:45.566
It's a crackpot lead. An old man and
an elephant out in the woods. Huh!

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:50.370
We're throwing out the bloody guy and
his bag! You pack this shit up!

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:55.323
- I'm getting out of here anyway!
- Easy now, Gunilla!

01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:01.648
First it was real important to share
equally and show solidarity
when it came to other people's money.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.330
But now there's no
need for consensus anymore.

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.009
What do you want, Benny? What do you
feel like? Do you want to die here?
Because that's what will happen!

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.647
No, I don't want that. I want to live.

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:16.450
What kind of a damn
question is that for him

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:25.721
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, Allan! It's Oleg.</i>

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:30.169
- Oleg!
<i>- Listen, we're landing soon.</i>

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:35.407
<i>Where should we fly to?  We need to</i>
<i>arrange with landing permits.</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:39.565
Just a minute, Oleg.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:44.403
<i>Pike</i>, where do you think we should go?
We can go anywhere we damn well please.

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:51.329
- I don't know.
- Just say the first thing
that pops into you head.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:58.491
- Bali... - Bali? That's good.
- Is that a place?
- It's an island, for Pete's sake.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.963
Hello? Yeah, Bali!

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:12.161
Behind the cinder deposit? What?

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.522
I'm sorry, that sounds
a bit strange in my opinion.

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:20.205
But surely I have
the right to voice my opinion?

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.961
Yes, I will deal with it. I'm on my way.

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.407
- Yes, hello.
- You were right all along.

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.522
These other leads had
nothing to do with the centenarian.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.570
Andrén issued an international APB.
They've found both the <i>Bolt</i> and the <i>Bucket</i>.

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:02.649
- <i>The Bolt is in Djibouti</i>.
- Djibouti, what is that?

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:09.120
- It's a little state in East Africa.
- Uh-huh, how did he wind up there?

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.926
<i>I have no clue.</i>

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:42.288
Do they have DNA so they know it's him?

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.762
No, not yet. The suicide bomber made
hotchpotch of the whole square.

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.969
Uh-huh. And what happened to <i>the Bucket</i> ?

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:55.082
<i>They found him in Riga.</i>
<i>He was squashed in a car crusher.</i>

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.609
Didn't you have a theory that he got
shot in Sjötorp. <i>We found blood there</i>.

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:24.689
- That was elephants blood.
- Elephants blood...

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.086
<i>The Bucket didn't have any</i> gun wounds,
just crush wounds from the crusher.

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.688
<i>And according to the forensics there was</i>
<i>only elephant blood at Sjötorp.</i>

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.048
And what about, what was his name,
<i>the Pike</i>, where did he go?

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:42.204
We've got nothing linking him to the
centenarian. The warrant is not our jurisdiction.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.923
- So, we've got nothing on no one?
- No, nothing criminal at least.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.605
This is incredible.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.929
I've got the centenarian right in
front of me now - and an elephant.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.926
No shit! Well, ask him if he wants a
ride back to the nursing home.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.605
Over my dead body! Oh no.

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:10.491
<i>- You can let all of this go now.</i>
- Ok, I'll drop it.

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:16.840
- I'll drop it.
- <i>Despite everything, I've</i>
<i>got to say that you've</i>...

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:21.606
...done some damn fine work.
We'll see you Monday!

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:26.169
See you Monday. Goodbye.

01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:02.487
- Ow! It's very tight.
- But it's supposed to be tight.

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:06.405
- But you'll cut off the circulation.
- You do it then.

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:12.728
No, I want you to do it, even
though you suck at it.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.610
- Yes, hello.
- Oh you're still alive are you?

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:43.001
- Well, where the fuck are ya?
- Bali.

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.805
Bali? Well you really are taking the
fuckin' piss out of me now aren't ya?

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.610
- Ehy?
<i>- What piss, hello?</i>

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.969
- That's Allan Karlsson.
That's Allan in the next car.
- Who?

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.770
Patsy, have a look on the left!
Look it's Allan Karlsson with my bag.
In the car on the left!

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:05.083
I wonder why we humans are drawn to
the sea. The sense of freedom I guess.

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.530
Do something! Ram the car!
Do something!

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.487
What a crash!

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.847
It's a nice island this, Bali.

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:21.929
Hello? Are you left on the phone?

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:37.968
Well well.

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.602
Yeah...

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:04.928
- What the hell, did you
get malaria already?
- What?

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.730
- You're as pale as a sheet.
- No...

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:13.405
Things are a bit of a mess right now.
I don't know.

01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:17.806
But come on, she wants you!

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:21.768
Yeah, I know. It's only...

01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:28.730
Things are getting serious now.
I need to like, make up my mind.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.645
I'll go and fetch us one more.

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:42.921
- It's not everyone's privilege.
- What do you mean?

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.162
I mean, to have what you have.

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.809
It's a privilege of few.

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:57.244
Go over to her and just say it.

01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:02.771
- Do I have to say that it's not
everyone's privilege?
- No, you make everything so complicated!

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.561
Just walk over.

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:14.324
Well, so... I get what you're saying.
I was just thinking that...

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.126
<i>Well, like I said, it's</i>
<i>not everyones privilege.</i>

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.408
<i>You never know.</i>

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:43.604
<i>Tomorrow's another day.</i>

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.082
- <i>What the hell did you tell him, Allan?</i>
- Why is she shouting at you?

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:53.250
Well, there are a lot of people who have
shouted at me during my life.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:57.646
Everyone from conductors to dictators.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:00.767
The first one to scream
because of me was my mother.

<i>I do not remember her screaming,</i>
<i>but I'm pretty sure she did.</i>

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.207
<i>I probably screamed too.</i>

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:14.490
<i>That's what new-borns do</i>
<i>the first time they get to look around.</i>
