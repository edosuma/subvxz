00:01.049 --> 00:02.717
Previously on "Rescue Me..."

00:02.784 --> 00:06.187
- And when I told you when I died
I didn't see anything... - Yeah?

00:06.254 --> 00:07.855
I lied. I saw something.

00:07.923 --> 00:09.290
Tommy!

00:09.358 --> 00:11.058
You said you'd come back to get me.

00:11.126 --> 00:13.160
Tommy!

00:13.228 --> 00:14.595
- Sean.
- Pat.

00:14.663 --> 00:15.563
What's up, bro?

00:15.630 --> 00:19.266
Of course it's from ground zero.
32-year-old men don't get kidney cancer.

00:19.334 --> 00:22.203
I mean, mine's in the lungs, so
it's obvious where it came from.

00:22.270 --> 00:23.404
Is Franco there?

00:23.472 --> 00:24.572
Janet just wants to say hey.

00:24.639 --> 00:27.007
Oh, cool. Hey, Jan-Jan.
What's going on?

00:27.075 --> 00:28.442
I'm...I'm jealous.

00:28.510 --> 00:30.878
You realize that's ridiculous, right?
We're brothers, bro.

00:30.946 --> 00:34.081
Can I just point out that my
actual brother, my real brother,

00:34.149 --> 00:35.883
had an affair with my wife?

00:35.951 --> 00:38.886
That, my dear nephew, is a
rare bottle of Irish whiskey.

00:38.954 --> 00:41.822
We've come to the conclusion...
That you're a lost cause,

00:41.890 --> 00:43.557
and now we've got to cut you loose.

00:43.625 --> 00:47.194
We are having a huge cookout, and we are
going to stuff them all full of free food.

00:47.262 --> 00:48.634
Great public relations.

00:48.754 --> 00:51.499
Get them in here, load them up, you know,
then have them call the Mayor's office.

00:51.566 --> 00:53.934
West Side wild men, 8 blocks over.
Listen to this.

00:54.002 --> 00:56.137
The Mayor's thinking about
shutting down their house.

00:56.204 --> 00:58.272
So they're having a pig roast.

00:58.340 --> 01:01.236
So how's it feel to play second fiddle
to the best house in Harlem?

01:01.356 --> 01:03.277
Second fiddle, my ass.
We were here first.

01:03.345 --> 01:04.245
Here. I'll do it.

01:04.312 --> 01:06.414
Better get a phone number out of this.

01:06.481 --> 01:08.215
His or mine?

01:08.641 --> 01:10.551
I'm a priest!
This is my parish!

01:10.619 --> 01:12.041
Get her out.

01:13.224 --> 01:15.723
God bless you. You saved Mary.

01:15.791 --> 01:17.158
There's a hole in her.

01:17.225 --> 01:18.813
Something's wrong with Lou.

01:24.966 --> 01:29.818
6 hours. 6 hours, and not one morsel
of information about what's going on.

01:29.938 --> 01:32.139
It's like an episode of
"Lost" in this joint,

01:32.207 --> 01:34.322
only our fat guy might die.

01:35.010 --> 01:38.979
Hospitals are the most depressing
place on the planet, you know.

01:39.493 --> 01:41.382
Hey, no news is good news, right?

01:41.450 --> 01:43.150
He had no pulse, Mike.

01:43.218 --> 01:45.219
So no news is bad news?

01:45.287 --> 01:46.954
Mike, you know what?

01:47.022 --> 01:49.990
Shut up. Just shut up.

01:50.058 --> 01:52.731
It's Lou. It's...You know.

01:53.595 --> 01:55.930
No news is...Lou news.

02:01.096 --> 02:03.465
- Are you here for lieutenant Shea?
- Yes, we are.

02:03.585 --> 02:05.005
You can see him now.

02:08.410 --> 02:09.776
Is he awake?

02:09.845 --> 02:10.678
Yeah, he's up.

02:10.745 --> 02:13.159
Hey, guys. What's happening?

02:13.279 --> 02:14.715
- Come on in.
- How are you, pal?

02:14.783 --> 02:15.783
I'm doing good, man.

02:15.851 --> 02:17.384
- I'm doing good.
- Good to see you.

02:17.452 --> 02:20.621
Hey, that's my bunkmate over there.
I call him Wheezer.

02:20.689 --> 02:22.490
I'll tell you why in a minute.

02:22.557 --> 02:24.892
Hey, look, I appreciate all
of these concerned looks,

02:24.960 --> 02:27.098
but, guys, really, I'm ok.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.763
- You don't look ok, Lou.
- You look like shit.

02:29.831 --> 02:33.652
I'll tell you, I feel fine. I don't even
mind sticking around here, you know.

02:33.772 --> 02:36.302
The cook-off's not for
another what, like, 10 days?

02:36.615 --> 02:39.271
And they got me hooked up with
this really nice nutrition lady.

02:39.883 --> 02:42.543
She's got a lot of great ideas
about diet and exercise.

02:46.515 --> 02:47.915
That's why.

02:47.983 --> 02:49.383
Hello, Mr. Shea.

02:49.451 --> 02:50.851
Hello, Hillary.

02:50.919 --> 02:52.887
Looks like you've got
visitors already.

02:52.954 --> 02:56.390
I do. Guys, this is Hillary, and
Hillary, these are the guys.

02:56.458 --> 02:57.825
Hi, Hillary. How are you?

02:57.893 --> 03:01.435
This poor lady has the job of
making me into a thin man.

03:01.555 --> 03:03.898
After she negotiates peace
in the Middle East.

03:03.965 --> 03:07.483
Yeah. And gets Rush Limbaugh
to share his Viagra with Kanye West.

03:08.530 --> 03:10.771
Yeah. See, this is the positive
reinforcement I was talking about.

03:10.839 --> 03:13.874
Well, do something positive,
and we'll reinforce it, you fat bastard.

03:13.942 --> 03:15.509
Yeah, like lose a goddamn chin.

03:15.577 --> 03:17.011
- Or 2.
- Or 6.

03:17.078 --> 03:18.145
Is that really necessary?

03:18.213 --> 03:19.914
Sweetheart, we work in a firehouse.

03:19.981 --> 03:22.283
So, like, brutal honestly
is our currency in trade.

03:22.350 --> 03:24.518
- And he's fat.
- Like, super fat.

03:24.586 --> 03:26.220
- Way fat.
- Too fat.

03:26.288 --> 03:27.154
You see?

03:27.222 --> 03:29.452
You have a giant mole on your face.

03:30.812 --> 03:32.594
Your eyes are too far apart.

03:36.287 --> 03:38.410
You have Mr. potato head lips.

03:41.427 --> 03:43.863
You both look mentally challenged.
Your skin

03:44.906 --> 03:48.175
Your skin is the color of Elmer's glue.

03:48.243 --> 03:52.846
And you, Owen Wilson called,
said he wants his nose back.

03:56.979 --> 03:58.437
The truth hurts sometimes.

03:58.557 --> 04:01.755
Think about that next time you're making
jokes at your friend's expense.

04:01.823 --> 04:06.106
Now, if you don't mind, Mr. Shea and I need
to discuss his future well-being. Beat it.

04:06.226 --> 04:08.028
Yes, we do.

04:08.096 --> 04:09.763
- All right, Lou.
- See you later.

04:09.831 --> 04:11.332
See you. Feel better.

04:11.399 --> 04:15.092
Um, when you say my eyes
are too far apart...

04:15.141 --> 04:15.998
I said beat it.

04:22.048 --> 04:23.978
It's called a beauty mark.

04:24.045 --> 04:25.446
Ok?

â™ª on another day c'mon, c'mon
with these ropes I tied

04:36.624 --> 04:38.225
can we do no wrong?

04:38.292 --> 04:42.929
Now we grieve 'cause now
is gone things were good

04:42.997 --> 04:47.701
when we were young with my teeth
locked down I can see the blood

04:47.768 --> 04:52.506
of a thousand men who have
come and gone now we grieve

04:52.573 --> 04:57.777
'cause now is gone things
were good when we were young

04:57.845 --> 04:59.112
is it safe to say?

04:59.180 --> 05:02.349
C'mon, c'mon was it right to leave?

05:02.416 --> 05:05.585
C'mon, c'mon will I ever learn?

05:05.653 --> 05:11.124
C'mon, c'mon c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon â™ª

05:17.607 --> 05:19.714
You guys think my eyes
are too far apart?

05:19.781 --> 05:23.050
Hey, maybe that's why you're such a good
point guard, you know... peripheral vision.

05:23.118 --> 05:25.086
Quiet, probie.
I'm talking to grown folks here.

05:25.154 --> 05:28.289
Seriously, yo, this shit has,
like, been keeping me up all night.

05:28.357 --> 05:29.261
Yeah. Well, no wonder.

05:29.381 --> 05:32.260
Every time you turn your head to one side
or another, an eye's hitting the pillow.

05:32.327 --> 05:35.530
- Aw...
- All right. Listen up.

05:35.597 --> 05:38.232
We are busting the fat man
out of the hospital tonight.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.768
The West Side wild men found
out that Lou was going

05:40.836 --> 05:42.970
to be in the hospital a week,
and they moved their cookout

05:43.038 --> 05:44.172
up to this weekend.

05:44.239 --> 05:46.958
If we're going to do the proper food prep,
we've got to move now.

05:47.078 --> 05:48.863
Wait a second, Chief, the guy
just had a heart attack.

05:48.983 --> 05:51.027
Hey, this is war, gentleman.

05:51.147 --> 05:54.148
And in war you put your personal safety
aside for the benefit of the whole.

05:54.216 --> 05:55.354
That's right.

05:55.613 --> 05:58.119
If Lou's not at that cookout, then
the West Side Wild Men have the advantage.

05:58.187 --> 05:59.754
They're going to win the
hearts and the minds

05:59.821 --> 06:01.422
of the whole neighborhood,
and we're done.

06:01.490 --> 06:03.057
Yep. The next thing you know,
the department's nailing up

06:03.125 --> 06:04.959
the windows and doors of
this place, and we're either

06:05.027 --> 06:07.361
in the wind or reassigned to
some shit hole like Bedstuy

06:07.429 --> 06:08.462
or Staten Island.

06:08.530 --> 06:10.131
Yeah.
So we're breaking him out.

06:10.199 --> 06:12.133
And when is this great
escape taking place?

06:12.201 --> 06:12.934
Tonight.

06:13.001 --> 06:14.402
Tonight? No, I can't do it.

06:14.469 --> 06:16.270
What do you mean, you can't do it?

06:16.338 --> 06:17.572
I got a date with Penny.

06:17.639 --> 06:19.522
Who the hell is Penny?

06:19.642 --> 06:22.410
You know, Penny, the hot probie
chick from the West Side.

06:23.646 --> 06:25.621
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave the war room, Damien.

06:25.741 --> 06:26.475
Why?

06:26.595 --> 06:28.182
Because you're sleeping
with the enemy.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.016
Not yet.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.052
Hey, maybe this is a
good thing for us.

06:31.119 --> 06:31.786
You know what I mean?

06:31.853 --> 06:33.421
He can get the...Secrets.

06:33.488 --> 06:34.655
Oh, yeah. Like a spy.

06:34.723 --> 06:35.356
Yes.

06:35.424 --> 06:37.258
Yeah. He could, like,
pump her for information.

06:37.326 --> 06:39.260
Yeah, Mike, if I'm going to
be pumping her, you can bet

06:39.328 --> 06:41.362
your ass it won't be
for information...

06:41.430 --> 06:43.931
Unless it's for information
on where to put my cock.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.933
What? You don't know
where to put your cock?

06:46.001 --> 06:47.568
Well, I may have options.

06:47.636 --> 06:49.237
Somebody fill me in here.

06:49.304 --> 06:51.072
How is it that this little
peckerwood has usurped me

06:51.139 --> 06:53.140
as the resident pussy
hound in this house?

06:53.208 --> 06:56.077
Maybe because I'm not made of plastic,
Mr. Potato Head.

06:56.144 --> 06:58.679
Potato Head! Potato Head!

06:58.747 --> 06:59.780
Knock it off.

06:59.848 --> 07:02.984
Tommy and I stole these
uniforms, all right?

07:03.051 --> 07:04.852
You are going to be the
doctor, Franco, and you two

07:04.920 --> 07:06.020
are going to be orderlies.

07:06.088 --> 07:08.155
Uh, wait. Why does Franco
get to be the doctor?

07:08.223 --> 07:08.889
Oh, please.

07:08.957 --> 07:10.224
Why can't I be the doctor?

07:10.292 --> 07:11.626
We really need to go there?

07:11.693 --> 07:13.594
A brother has just as much
chance of being a doctor

07:13.662 --> 07:14.662
as a puerto rican.

07:14.730 --> 07:16.797
Neither one of you
really do have a chance,

07:16.865 --> 07:19.500
but if I had to pick one, I'd put
my money on the Puerto Rican.

07:19.568 --> 07:20.468
Score one for Puerto Rico.

07:20.535 --> 07:23.204
No, no, chief.
There's plenty of black doctors that are

07:23.272 --> 07:24.605
out there. You know it.

07:24.673 --> 07:26.140
Name one.

07:27.168 --> 07:28.815
Dr. Bill Cosby.

07:29.427 --> 07:30.475
Name another.

07:30.801 --> 07:31.912
Dr. Huxtable.

07:31.980 --> 07:32.980
Same guy.

07:33.048 --> 07:34.615
One's make-believe, don't count.

07:34.683 --> 07:35.650
Dr. J.

07:35.717 --> 07:36.951
Nah, nah. Basketball player.

07:37.019 --> 07:38.286
Got anything else?

07:38.353 --> 07:39.920
Reverend Al Sharpton.

07:39.988 --> 07:40.988
What?

07:41.056 --> 07:43.724
I don't know.
Any time black people get caught

07:43.792 --> 07:46.060
in a corner, we just use that
as a code name, throwing

07:46.128 --> 07:46.994
the rev out.

07:47.062 --> 07:48.629
See, this is one of your problems.

07:48.697 --> 07:50.965
You don't talk white good, and
Franco talks perfect white.

07:51.033 --> 07:52.199
Franco, talk some white.

07:52.267 --> 07:53.034
I'd be very happy to, Thomas.

07:53.101 --> 07:55.670
Hello. I am Dr. Francisco Rivera.

07:55.737 --> 07:57.238
Ok? Perfect Caucasian.

07:57.306 --> 07:57.905
Yeah.

07:57.973 --> 07:59.540
It's easy.
I just clench my ass cheeks together

07:59.608 --> 08:01.976
as tight as I can and think
about egg salad sandwiches.

08:02.044 --> 08:04.544
All right. Ok. Well, how come
I can't be the orderly?

08:04.664 --> 08:07.918
Because we didn't want to make
the orderly a black guy cause that's racist.

08:08.038 --> 08:09.817
Hey, what would Reverend Al say then?

08:09.885 --> 08:10.785
Yeah.

08:10.852 --> 08:13.421
Excuse me.
Are you guys from ladder 62?

08:13.488 --> 08:14.689
Yes.

08:14.756 --> 08:15.890
Father Phil Bingham.

08:15.957 --> 08:17.124
How are you, father?

08:17.192 --> 08:18.392
Holy redeemer.

08:18.460 --> 08:21.262
I wanted to drop by to apologize
for my behavior the other night.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.631
You did a brave thing pulling
me and sister Rosemary

08:23.699 --> 08:26.634
and the statue of our
holy mother to safety.

08:26.702 --> 08:29.837
And I wasn't very gracious
about the chip in Mary's ass.

08:29.905 --> 08:31.339
So for that, I apologize.

08:31.406 --> 08:32.840
You guys are doing God's work.

08:32.908 --> 08:34.909
Every single one of you
deserves a first-class ticket

08:34.976 --> 08:37.544
to his kingdom.
Of course, we don't want to make that

08:37.611 --> 08:39.746
any time too soon.

08:39.815 --> 08:42.450
I have a receipt here for the statue.
I was thinking

08:42.517 --> 08:45.152
maybe the department had
a reimbursement policy,

08:45.220 --> 08:47.054
you know, for property
that was damaged.

08:47.122 --> 08:48.322
Maybe you could process that.

08:48.390 --> 08:50.157
Well, geez, if it's only like
a couple of hundred bucks,

08:50.225 --> 08:52.093
I'm sure we'd be willing
to chip in, right, guys?

08:52.160 --> 08:53.928
What do you need, father?

08:53.995 --> 08:55.563
Jesus Christ. 40 grand?

08:55.630 --> 08:58.165
Oh, my God, man.
That's an expensive piece of ass.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.834
Well, she's a virgin.

08:59.901 --> 09:01.569
She's 700 years old.

09:01.636 --> 09:03.571
Father, look, this is the FDNY.
I mean,

09:03.638 --> 09:05.072
it's not American Express.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.574
I understand.

09:06.641 --> 09:08.342
Don't you have fire insurance?

09:08.410 --> 09:10.511
The Catholic Church hardly
has a pot to piss in,

09:10.631 --> 09:12.813
after all the bread we spent
on lawyers and silenced

09:12.881 --> 09:15.116
those goddamn child molesters.

09:15.183 --> 09:18.853
They put us in the poorhouse, which
is probably where we belong.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.389
You know, padre, I really don't
think we can help you out.

09:21.456 --> 09:24.125
I mean, we just put out the fires
and save the people, you know.

09:24.192 --> 09:24.859
No sweat, fellas.

09:24.926 --> 09:27.428
I'm not trying to put my hands
in anybody's pockets...

09:27.496 --> 09:29.797
Unlike those pocket-pool
perverts I was talking about

09:29.865 --> 09:31.729
a minute ago.

09:33.784 --> 09:37.138
May God protect you from every
danger and bless your families,

09:37.205 --> 09:39.073
especially in your absence.

09:39.602 --> 09:43.344
Fellas, if you ever need anything,
you know where to find me.

09:43.412 --> 09:44.512
Thank you, father.

09:44.579 --> 09:46.380
We work the same hours you do.

09:46.448 --> 09:48.215
Uh, father. Quick question.

09:48.283 --> 09:51.986
- If you had to say...
- Oh, come on.

09:51.987 --> 09:53.254
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

09:53.321 --> 09:55.923
I think that the padre might
have an opinion in the matter,

09:55.991 --> 09:57.970
and I'd like to know who do you think

09:58.310 --> 10:00.625
has a better shot at being a doctor...

10:01.387 --> 10:04.312
a black man or a Puerto Rican?

10:07.502 --> 10:09.970
Puerto Rican. No question.

10:10.038 --> 10:12.173
But bless you all... black
guys, Puerto Rican guys,

10:12.240 --> 10:13.874
even you Irish knuckleheads.

10:13.942 --> 10:14.809
Thank you, father.

10:14.876 --> 10:16.444
Banner day for my people.

10:21.696 --> 10:22.329
Doctor.

10:22.396 --> 10:23.229
Hello, doctor.

10:23.297 --> 10:24.197
Doctor.

10:24.265 --> 10:25.165
Doctor.

10:25.232 --> 10:27.434
Doctor.

10:27.501 --> 10:28.201
Doctor.

10:28.269 --> 10:30.604
Doctor.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.271
Hey, Frank.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.539
Yeah?

10:32.607 --> 10:34.407
I don't think we're in
the right wing, dude.

10:34.475 --> 10:35.208
Nah, nah, nah, dude.

10:35.276 --> 10:36.042
We were just here yesterday.

10:36.110 --> 10:37.077
Relax.

10:37.144 --> 10:40.347
I think, but none of this shit
really looks familiar, does it?

10:40.414 --> 10:41.081
Well, I don't know, man.

10:41.148 --> 10:42.882
Maybe we took the wrong elevator up.

10:42.950 --> 10:44.050
I don't know.

10:44.118 --> 10:45.719
You think maybe we
should ask somebody?

10:45.786 --> 10:47.121
Yeah. Great thinking,
double-o-nothing.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.549
A doctor asking for directions
in the hospital

10:48.571 --> 10:50.019
is not gonna raise any eyebrows?

10:50.139 --> 10:51.906
OK, let's just stick together
and keep looking, ok?

10:52.026 --> 10:52.759
Yeah.

10:52.827 --> 10:54.928
Yo. Where the hell is Sean?

10:56.000 --> 11:02.074

11:09.777 --> 11:11.578
Garrity?

11:11.646 --> 11:12.979
Hi.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.315
It's Mahoney.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.417
Pat Mahoney. Oh, my God.

11:17.485 --> 11:18.885
Christ, man. Long time, no see.

11:18.953 --> 11:20.654
What the hell are you doing here?

11:20.721 --> 11:21.821
I have cancer.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.156
Right. Right. Right. Yeah.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.658
How's that going, by the way?

11:24.725 --> 11:25.492
Yeah.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.194
Yeah, yeah. But, yeah, I thought
you were out of the woods.

11:28.262 --> 11:30.196
No, I'm so deep in the woods,
bears are wiping their asses

11:30.264 --> 11:33.099
with me. What's with the getup?

11:33.167 --> 11:34.167
Oh, it's nothing.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.835
It's really... I'm not supposed to say.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.704
But, Lou, he had a heart attack,
and we're busting him out

11:37.772 --> 11:40.006
because we've got this
cook-off coming up... shit.

11:40.074 --> 11:40.840
No, no. Don't worry.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.008
Your secret is safe with me.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.009
Really? You promise?

11:43.077 --> 11:44.778
I might be dead by the time
I have a chance to spill

11:44.845 --> 11:45.812
the goddamn beans.

11:45.880 --> 11:46.479
Oh, come on, man.

11:46.547 --> 11:47.213
Don't talk like that.

11:47.281 --> 11:48.148
Really, you're going to be fine.

11:48.215 --> 11:50.784
Hey, you got to bust me out, too.

11:50.851 --> 11:51.518
What?

11:51.585 --> 11:52.652
I can't stand it here, man.

11:52.720 --> 11:53.486
The pills, the chemo.

11:53.554 --> 11:55.188
The doctors think they're
saving me, but really they're

11:55.256 --> 11:56.923
just killing me slower.

11:56.991 --> 11:59.826
I got my own ideas about
how to spend my last days,

11:59.894 --> 12:02.495
but they keep telling me I've
got to stay in this hell hole.

12:02.563 --> 12:03.930
But now I got a way out.

12:03.998 --> 12:04.698
Oh, hey, yeah.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.933
I don't know, man.
I mean, our plan is pretty complex.

12:08.302 --> 12:10.437
Holy... are you ok?

12:10.504 --> 12:11.705
Yeah.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.807
Cancer. You know, it's...
do you have a baby wipe

12:13.874 --> 12:15.575
or something? No offense.

12:15.643 --> 12:16.342
No.

12:16.410 --> 12:18.545
All right. So I'm just going
to tell you straight up,

12:18.612 --> 12:20.547
the guys in my house wanted
me to try to get information

12:20.614 --> 12:22.182
about your cookout.

12:22.249 --> 12:24.484
Yeah.
Same with the guys in my house.

12:24.552 --> 12:28.054
Oh, really? So...
How do we handle this?

12:28.122 --> 12:31.057
We ignore it, and we have a good time.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.959
And then you tell me later.

12:33.027 --> 12:35.428
And when are you going to tell me?

12:35.496 --> 12:39.299
It depends on how good
of a time you show me.

12:39.366 --> 12:41.735
Ha. All right.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.776
You look really pretty.

12:49.844 --> 12:50.761
Ha.

12:52.213 --> 12:53.980
Is something wrong with pretty?

12:54.048 --> 12:57.917
No. It's, um... it's just a nickname
that I had in high school...

12:57.985 --> 13:02.622
Pretty Penny.
I hated the shit out of that nickname.

13:03.438 --> 13:05.743
Well, in some countries, it's a compliment.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.729
Yeah, in my country is inaccurate.

13:10.907 --> 13:13.356
I don't like pretty things. I like action.

13:13.476 --> 13:16.136
I like getting my hands dirty
and sweating, being physical.

13:16.203 --> 13:18.071
I mean, that's why I'm a firefighter.

13:18.139 --> 13:19.906
You know, you could have
saved yourself some danger

13:19.974 --> 13:22.108
and become a landscaper.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.778
I like the danger, too.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.746
Plus, daddy wasn't a landscaper.

13:26.814 --> 13:30.650
He was a firefighter, like yours.

13:30.718 --> 13:32.185
You know about my dad?

13:32.253 --> 13:33.653
Yeah. He's a legend.

13:33.721 --> 13:36.222
I mean, he's the reason why
you signed up, isn't he?

13:36.290 --> 13:38.458
Uh...Yeah. Yeah.

13:38.526 --> 13:42.028
I mean, there were other reasons,
too, namely to piss off

13:42.096 --> 13:43.596
my mother and my uncle.

13:43.664 --> 13:46.866
Those were pretty big reasons
actually, but, uh...

13:46.934 --> 13:50.937
Yeah. No, I mean...
The real reason is my dad.

13:51.005 --> 13:52.438
It's a heavy load.

13:52.506 --> 13:56.810
You know, I used to think
he didn't like me... my dad.

13:58.311 --> 14:02.182
Because, um... I never really
showed much interest in the job

14:02.249 --> 14:05.485
when he was, you know...Around.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.887
Yeah, but look at you now.

14:07.955 --> 14:09.789
I bet he's proud.

14:09.857 --> 14:10.723
Right. Well, he's not proud.

14:10.791 --> 14:12.392
He's dead.

14:14.862 --> 14:20.867
Sorry. I'm sorry. I... it's weird.
I don't really talk

14:20.935 --> 14:24.904
about this shit with people...
Ever.

14:24.972 --> 14:27.607
Damn, you must really want
info about that cookout.

14:27.675 --> 14:30.109
Ha ha.

14:30.177 --> 14:31.277
Want to get wasted?

14:31.345 --> 14:33.299
Yes. Please.

14:34.782 --> 14:36.749
Hey. What the hell?

14:36.817 --> 14:38.318
Sorry. I got lost.

14:38.385 --> 14:41.187
This place is like a giant
goddamn germ-infested maze.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.056
Hey, is that balls-out Mahoney?

14:43.123 --> 14:43.823
Hey, Lou.

14:43.891 --> 14:44.524
How you doing?

14:44.592 --> 14:45.491
Cancer. You?

14:45.559 --> 14:46.326
Heart attack.

14:46.393 --> 14:47.093
Lucky man.

14:47.161 --> 14:49.095
By the way, guys, we're
busting him out, too.

14:49.163 --> 14:53.103
Don't worry. I'll be as quiet
as a...

14:57.171 --> 15:00.106
A mouse. I'm guessing.

15:00.174 --> 15:01.641
This could be a problem, guys.

15:01.709 --> 15:03.844
No, it only happens
when...

15:07.081 --> 15:09.616
Anyone got any dynamite or a
foghorn they want to blow off?

15:09.683 --> 15:11.017
Yeah, this is... we're not doing this.

15:11.085 --> 15:12.986
No offense, Pat, but the
plan's already in place.

15:13.053 --> 15:13.653
It's too complicated.

15:13.721 --> 15:15.555
Yeah. No, I don't want
to go into work for you.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.322
No, that's bullshit.

15:16.390 --> 15:17.123
He's coming with us.

15:17.191 --> 15:17.824
That's bullshit.

15:17.892 --> 15:18.625
This isn't part of the plan.

15:18.692 --> 15:20.193
Oh, come on.
Plans are for pussies, all right?

15:20.261 --> 15:22.327
How many times have you run
into a fire and actually stick to the plan?

15:22.348 --> 15:24.082
Once, twice, out of ten? Maybe?

15:24.593 --> 15:25.501
He's coming with us, screw your plan.

15:25.566 --> 15:26.232
You just settle down.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.901
No.
We're not leaving him here.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.602
What's the matter with you?

15:29.670 --> 15:31.671
The guy's dying because he
spent every day for 8 months

15:31.739 --> 15:33.840
cleaning up the shit
down at ground zero.

15:33.908 --> 15:34.807
You said it yourself.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.776
If this is a war, then
we're an army, right?

15:36.844 --> 15:38.645
A guy runs out on the
battlefield, picks up

15:38.712 --> 15:41.180
a fallen comrade, he's as brave
as the hero he's picking up.

15:41.248 --> 15:42.515
Am I wrong?

15:43.704 --> 15:45.551
Am I wrong?

15:45.619 --> 15:46.552
We take care of our own.

15:46.620 --> 15:47.353
Pat took care of our guys.

15:47.421 --> 15:48.221
We take care of Pat.

15:48.289 --> 15:50.924
End of story.

15:50.991 --> 15:55.094
Mmm...
Well, better put your party hat

15:55.162 --> 15:58.097
on there, Patty boy.
Looks like you're coming with us.

15:58.165 --> 15:58.865
Put this on.

15:58.933 --> 15:59.799
You keep your head down.

15:59.867 --> 16:01.167
You guys take him out the north exit.

16:01.235 --> 16:02.969
We're going to take Lou out the south.
All right?

16:03.037 --> 16:04.504
Black Shawn, come on. Let's go.

16:04.571 --> 16:07.106
Ha ha. Doctor, doctor,
give me the news, son.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.542
No, no, no, no.
Mike, switch your shit with him.

16:09.610 --> 16:10.209
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:10.277 --> 16:12.278
Wait. Wait.
I thought it was racist, making

16:12.346 --> 16:13.346
a brother an orderly.

16:13.414 --> 16:15.548
Hey, you've got down syndrome.
Ok?

16:15.616 --> 16:16.316
You're lucky you have a job.

16:16.383 --> 16:17.083
Let's go. Change up.

16:17.151 --> 16:18.518
I ain't got down syndrome.

16:18.585 --> 16:19.385
Come on, Mike.

16:19.453 --> 16:20.486
Hurry up.

16:23.457 --> 16:25.224
What about me?

16:29.124 --> 16:30.425
Let's go. Let's go.

16:30.492 --> 16:31.592
Orderly, please.

16:31.660 --> 16:32.827
Careful, careful. Jesus!

16:32.895 --> 16:34.662
It's going to be to the left here.
To the left.

16:34.730 --> 16:35.830
Easy, easy. Slow down.

16:35.898 --> 16:37.031
Slow down.

16:37.099 --> 16:39.448
Jesus Christ, if you drive my truck
the way you're driving this thing...

16:39.568 --> 16:42.441
Yeah, bring the truck around
to the front so we can get the hell free.

16:43.072 --> 16:45.073
You're crushing the doctor.

16:45.140 --> 16:46.140
Hit the button.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.175
To the right, orderly.

16:47.242 --> 16:48.142
To the right.

16:48.210 --> 16:49.544
Hit the button.

16:51.246 --> 16:53.581
Hey. What's happening?

16:53.649 --> 16:54.849
What are you doing?

16:54.917 --> 16:58.252
Get on. Get on.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.321
Shit.

17:00.389 --> 17:01.122
Oh, my God.

17:01.190 --> 17:02.290
What are you shitiots up to?

17:02.358 --> 17:04.425
We're just checking Lou out
a little ahead of schedule.

17:04.492 --> 17:05.093
That's all.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.127
All right. Is that allowed?

17:06.194 --> 17:07.729
I wouldn't be wearing
this uniform if it were,

17:07.796 --> 17:09.597
but it does suit me, don't you think?

17:09.665 --> 17:10.832
Hey, why are we going up?

17:10.898 --> 17:12.333
I hit the ground floor button.

17:12.401 --> 17:13.835
Well, hit it again, Corky.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.037
Yeah, listen. He doesn't
really look good enough to go.

17:16.105 --> 17:16.838
He's fine.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.573
Yeah. We need him back at
the house for the cook-off.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.875
Oh, my God. You are breaking
him out of the hospital

17:20.943 --> 17:22.310
for a goddamn cook-off?

17:22.377 --> 17:24.345
Maybe it's not the best
idea in the world.

17:24.413 --> 17:26.247
There is nothing more
important than that cook-off.

17:26.315 --> 17:28.215
Huh.
How about your friend's life?

17:28.282 --> 17:30.018
Hmm? What life would that be?

17:30.085 --> 17:31.919
Ok? We lose the cook-off,
we lose the house.

17:31.987 --> 17:34.689
Without the house and without
us, Lou is lost in the world.

17:34.757 --> 17:36.157
He could walk right into
the nearest olive garden

17:36.225 --> 17:39.027
and use that never-ending
pasta bowl like a loaded .45.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.464
It's true.

17:40.896 --> 17:42.463
Sorry, folks. Swine flu.

17:42.531 --> 17:43.931
Highly contagious.

17:43.999 --> 17:45.566
Nasty.

17:54.109 --> 17:55.543
All right, you jokers.

17:55.611 --> 17:57.912
This is where I cut out.

17:57.980 --> 18:00.782
Listen, Lou-Lou, honey.

18:00.849 --> 18:01.482
Yes?

18:02.418 --> 18:04.585
Do not let these animals
kill you, right?

18:04.653 --> 18:06.054
Ok, honey pie. Thank you.

18:06.121 --> 18:07.021
You look great.

18:07.089 --> 18:08.322
What? What's that you said?

18:08.390 --> 18:09.424
I said you look great.

18:09.491 --> 18:10.625
Thank you.

18:20.102 --> 18:20.835
Holy shit!

18:20.903 --> 18:22.737
Dude, you totally almost
got hit by that taxi.

18:22.805 --> 18:25.006
That would have been ironic, huh?

18:25.074 --> 18:27.608
Never mind.

18:27.676 --> 18:28.609
That was amazing.

18:28.677 --> 18:30.478
I haven't laughed that hard
since the government sent me

18:30.546 --> 18:32.613
that thank-you letter for
working at ground zero

18:32.681 --> 18:35.416
instead of helping me pay
for my medical bills.

18:35.484 --> 18:37.318
Hey, should we go celebrate
with a couple brewskis?

18:37.386 --> 18:38.886
Better yet, why don't the two of us go

18:38.954 --> 18:40.655
and you meet us there later
after you give Flavor Flav

18:40.722 --> 18:41.989
his clothes back, ok?

18:42.057 --> 18:43.524
What do you want to do?
You want to hit the hustler club?

18:45.494 --> 18:46.327
You all right?

18:46.395 --> 18:47.595
Oh, Jesus Christ.

18:47.663 --> 18:49.897
Oh, shit.

18:49.965 --> 18:51.532
Uh, maybe we should go back.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.333
Yeah. Come on.

18:52.401 --> 18:54.035
Come on, Mike.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.773
So you're the doctor in charge?

18:58.317 --> 18:59.855
Um, yes.

19:00.175 --> 19:01.707
As a matter of fact, I am.

19:01.827 --> 19:05.613
See, you wouldn't think that,
now, would you, doctor?

19:05.681 --> 19:08.616
Orderly, I'm going to step
aside with the doctor.

19:08.684 --> 19:10.852
We're going to have a
little doctor-to-doctor.

19:10.919 --> 19:12.320
Watch the body.

19:12.387 --> 19:14.589
Hey, I'm still alive, doc.

19:14.656 --> 19:16.075
Yeah.

19:17.526 --> 19:19.527
Go get the truck, you idiot.

19:19.595 --> 19:21.696
What were we talking about?

19:21.763 --> 19:26.000
Show me your identification, doctor...
Rico. Richards.

19:26.068 --> 19:27.168
Rico Richards. Yeah.

19:27.236 --> 19:29.804
My mother's Puerto Rican,
and my father's Jewish,

19:29.872 --> 19:32.473
which explains why I graduated
from the top of my class

19:32.541 --> 19:37.145
at Johns Hopkins University, and
the Puerto Rican part, I...

19:37.212 --> 19:38.346
I think the jig is up.

19:38.413 --> 19:40.948
No, not yet.
He's laying down that Latin magic.

19:41.016 --> 19:42.583
And making eye contact.

19:42.651 --> 19:43.317
Look at that.

19:43.385 --> 19:45.286
Like a dagger through the heart.

19:45.354 --> 19:47.989
I'll tell you all
about it over coffee.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.657
You know, with a face like
that, you've got to wonder

19:49.725 --> 19:51.592
why the hell he became a smoke eater.

19:51.660 --> 19:52.593
Simple math, Lou.

19:52.661 --> 19:54.762
You take his face, you
multiply it by our job,

19:54.830 --> 19:58.099
and you end up with a grand total of...
Pussy.

19:58.167 --> 19:59.200
Class dismissed.

19:59.268 --> 20:00.768
Son of a bitch.

20:00.836 --> 20:02.303
Look at this.

20:02.371 --> 20:05.806
- If I had that power...
- You'd eat it.

20:05.874 --> 20:10.178
I'll see you. Bye.

20:10.245 --> 20:12.246
Coast is clear, gentlemen.

20:12.314 --> 20:13.981
Dr. Richards saves the day.

20:14.049 --> 20:15.383
Thank you, doctor.

20:15.450 --> 20:17.351
Shall we?
I believe we're going this way.

20:17.419 --> 20:19.020
The lady's on our side.

20:23.335 --> 20:25.193
There he is. Hey, pal.

20:25.260 --> 20:27.528
Hey. Oh, you're still here.

20:27.596 --> 20:29.030
Yeah, man. Of course.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.799
I figured you'd seen enough
of me after last night.

20:31.867 --> 20:32.767
Hey, you know what?

20:32.834 --> 20:35.069
Why don't you lay back,
take a load off, will you?

20:35.137 --> 20:37.171
Yeah.

20:37.239 --> 20:40.408
Whoo. This sucks.

20:44.980 --> 20:48.149
I'm going to die in this room.

20:48.717 --> 20:51.057
I'm going to die in this room,
and nobody's going to give a shit.

20:52.363 --> 20:59.126
No...plaques, no parades, no...
scholarships in my name.

21:00.261 --> 21:01.783
So, what did I do it for?

21:05.008 --> 21:07.702
Why did I put my ass on
the line after the fact?

21:08.572 --> 21:12.735
Because...
That's what we've always done.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.882
That's what we do, right?
It's our job.

21:16.311 --> 21:17.111
You know what?

21:17.179 --> 21:18.012
Don't worry about anything.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.280
Ok? You're in good hands.

21:19.954 --> 21:21.274
I'm going to take care of everything.

21:22.484 --> 21:25.151
I wish I could say that's
a comforting sentiment.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.590
Yeah. I...
Wish I knew how to back it up. Ha ha.

21:29.658 --> 21:31.061
Got any ideas?

21:33.129 --> 21:34.911
I'll come up with something.
I just...

21:41.536 --> 21:42.570
Hey.

21:42.638 --> 21:44.105
Hey. Eat.

21:44.172 --> 21:45.273
Eat, please.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.007
Wow.

21:46.074 --> 21:50.444
- Yep. We've got mini Cuban sandwiches...
- Holy shit.

21:50.512 --> 21:53.714
Pastrami puffs, pizza rolls.

21:53.782 --> 21:55.516
Probably the best I've ever cooked.

21:55.584 --> 21:57.452
Ok. What gives?

21:57.572 --> 21:59.820
Because usually if you're
standing in a sea of cheese

21:59.888 --> 22:01.656
like this, you'd be
doing an Irish jig.

22:01.723 --> 22:02.390
Yeah, I know.

22:02.457 --> 22:05.726
I was just, you know,
recently diagnosed as being

22:05.794 --> 22:07.995
an emotional eater.

22:08.063 --> 22:09.664
- Diagnosed?
- Yes.

22:09.731 --> 22:10.431
By who?

22:10.499 --> 22:12.166
My nurse, Hillary.

22:12.234 --> 22:13.234
She's a genius.

22:13.302 --> 22:14.101
Yeah, but you know what?

22:14.169 --> 22:15.036
She hit it right on the head.

22:15.103 --> 22:16.203
I mean, I eat when I'm up.

22:16.271 --> 22:17.338
I eat when I'm down.

22:17.406 --> 22:19.674
I eat when I'm melancholy.

22:19.741 --> 22:22.009
I eat when the Mets lose.

22:22.077 --> 22:25.780
I eat basically during
all of my waking hours.

22:25.847 --> 22:26.814
I mean, I'm like a shark.

22:26.882 --> 22:29.483
For Christ's sakes, I've had,
like, 3 of each of these things.

22:29.551 --> 22:31.552
You know, I'm thinking of
calling ahead to the hospital

22:31.620 --> 22:33.354
and reserving a better room.

22:35.031 --> 22:36.424
I think I should probably
take this shit out of here,

22:36.491 --> 22:39.289
because it sounds like you're
going to eat yourself to death.

22:39.409 --> 22:41.762
I think that's kind of the point
of being an emotional eater.

22:42.524 --> 22:45.232
You know...Ha.

22:45.776 --> 22:49.637
You're not the only one who, uh...
Who died around here

22:49.757 --> 22:51.439
lately, pal.
I mean, I think I went out, too.

22:51.506 --> 22:52.606
I mean, I'm pretty sure of it.

22:52.674 --> 22:56.025
Blackness, I had visions.

22:56.284 --> 22:58.379
Except I didn't really
see anything at first.

22:58.447 --> 23:00.796
It was more of a...
It was more of a smell.

23:01.563 --> 23:02.650
What did you smell?

23:03.494 --> 23:06.144
Well, I smelled a bakery.

23:06.457 --> 23:07.273
A bakery?

23:07.393 --> 23:10.867
It wasn't toast.
It was a real bakery.

23:11.357 --> 23:12.893
And then I just had this feeling.

23:12.961 --> 23:14.228
Uh-huh. I know what you mean.

23:14.296 --> 23:16.063
- Waves of...
- Dread.

23:16.131 --> 23:17.465
No. Joy.

23:17.927 --> 23:20.134
It was the most incredible joyous feeling.
I mean, it's not

23:20.202 --> 23:22.470
like winning at the track or
banging a beautiful broad,

23:22.537 --> 23:24.338
you know, who's way
out of your league.

23:24.406 --> 23:27.808
It was just the most peaceful...

23:27.876 --> 23:34.382
Content, happy...Ha ha...Joy.

23:34.449 --> 23:35.850
It was insane.

23:37.140 --> 23:39.929
Ok. What did you see?

23:40.391 --> 23:41.922
And then I saw my mother.

23:43.106 --> 23:44.085
And she was a zombie.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.861
No. No, Tom.
She was my mother.

23:46.928 --> 23:49.397
She was just the way that I
remembered her as a kid.

23:50.132 --> 23:52.333
I was sitting in the old kitchen.
She was on the phone

23:52.401 --> 23:56.670
with my aunt Lee, and she was
working the stove, and I was

23:56.738 --> 24:02.676
sitting at the table, and I
was licking cupcake icing.

24:02.744 --> 24:04.211
Cupcake icing?

24:04.279 --> 24:08.830
Chocolate.
And she got up to hang up the phone,

24:08.950 --> 24:11.285
and she walked past
me, and she just...

24:12.150 --> 24:15.356
She just brushed the back
of my head with her hand,

24:15.424 --> 24:17.324
like she used to.

24:17.392 --> 24:21.937
And Tom, I swear to God, I can
still feel her hand there.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.135
Ok. And then...

24:28.203 --> 24:30.704
There was like...

24:30.772 --> 24:36.944
- Foreboding or darkness or...
- No. The only pain

24:37.012 --> 24:40.147
and suffering I felt
was having to leave.

24:40.215 --> 24:42.983
But the thought that that's
what's waiting for me

24:43.051 --> 24:47.555
and to know that I'm going to probably...
go back there,

24:47.622 --> 24:52.259
I mean, I'm kind of
looking forward to it.

24:52.327 --> 24:53.527
Bullshit.

24:53.595 --> 24:55.663
- Tom, I'm telling you...
- You didn't die.

24:55.730 --> 24:56.697
You did not die.

24:56.765 --> 24:57.798
You were dreaming.

24:57.866 --> 25:01.035
Well, you believe what you want.

25:01.102 --> 25:07.174
Seriously, you...You know...
You got icing and a bakery?

25:07.242 --> 25:09.376
Ha ha ha. This is what you
think that, you know,

25:09.444 --> 25:10.544
going to the other side is?

25:10.612 --> 25:12.947
You know, zombies. Ok?

25:13.014 --> 25:15.783
You know...You know, fear.

25:15.851 --> 25:18.085
Burning, you know.

25:18.153 --> 25:19.220
That's death.

25:19.287 --> 25:20.588
That's your death.

25:21.330 --> 25:22.122
I'm a little different.

25:22.190 --> 25:25.826
Oh, you're like...
Some kind of goddamn saint.

25:25.894 --> 25:27.428
You get to go to a bakery.

25:27.496 --> 25:30.231
How does that happen?

25:30.298 --> 25:32.800
I just think I'm a better person.

25:32.868 --> 25:33.968
Ha.

25:34.035 --> 25:35.169
Well, you asked.

25:35.237 --> 25:36.737
Do you want to add up bad shit?
Is that what

25:36.805 --> 25:38.839
you want to do?
Do you want to have a bad-shit contest?

25:38.907 --> 25:40.641
Because if you... all the bad
things I've done and all

25:40.709 --> 25:41.709
the bad things you've done?

25:41.776 --> 25:43.064
Come on.

25:43.184 --> 25:45.153
- That's a pretty equal cheat sheet.
- That's not a contest, Tommy.

25:45.273 --> 25:46.949
- You want an example?
- Yeah. - Okay.

25:47.069 --> 25:50.499
Candy. Candy, a hooker you ripped off

25:50.619 --> 25:53.854
so you could live in this beautiful
apartment you're living in.

25:53.922 --> 25:54.722
Here we go again with candy.

25:54.789 --> 25:56.490
Why don't you just let it drop, Tom?

25:56.558 --> 25:58.092
I was the victim there.

25:58.159 --> 25:59.326
Why is that different?

25:59.394 --> 26:02.396
Because, Tom, for Christ's
sakes, she went after me.

26:02.464 --> 26:05.165
She got what she deserved, Tom, all right?
She asked for it,

26:05.233 --> 26:08.102
and she deserved it. Ok?

26:08.871 --> 26:13.274
Katie, Colleen, Janet, Connor...
they didn't deserve it.

26:13.341 --> 26:14.775
They were innocent bystanders.

26:14.843 --> 26:16.176
You're supposed to protect them.

26:16.244 --> 26:18.612
Protect and serve.

26:18.680 --> 26:19.713
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

26:19.781 --> 26:21.649
You know, Tommy, I could
drop dead tomorrow.

26:21.716 --> 26:24.251
You could drop dead tomorrow,
and what would we get?

26:24.319 --> 26:28.355
A plaque on the wall, guys go
out drinking for a night. Ok?

26:28.423 --> 26:31.492
2 new guys would be in here
like that to replace us.

26:31.560 --> 26:32.159
And you know what?

26:32.227 --> 26:34.395
Maybe they'd do a better job,
maybe they'd do a worse job.

26:34.462 --> 26:37.765
But they'd replace us.

26:38.519 --> 26:41.349
There ain't no replacing
a father, Tom.

26:41.839 --> 26:43.118
You only get one.

26:45.054 --> 26:48.642
You should start thinking about
that, because maybe then

26:48.710 --> 26:54.648
you'd be smelling bakeries
for eternity, just like me.

27:22.435 --> 27:24.002
Ha.

27:32.678 --> 27:33.912
Hey!

27:33.980 --> 27:35.046
What are you doing here?

27:35.114 --> 27:36.214
I'm from 62 truck.

27:36.282 --> 27:37.716
I was here. I'm a fireman.

27:37.783 --> 27:39.618
We were here for the fire.

27:39.685 --> 27:42.089
What were you doing with
the infant of Prague?

27:43.356 --> 27:49.694
I was just touching his... her...
His dress? I was just...

27:49.762 --> 27:52.130
What's your name again?

27:52.198 --> 27:53.875
Thomas Gavin.

27:55.001 --> 27:56.612
Thomas Gavin.

27:57.203 --> 27:59.375
Holy Irish. Come on in.

28:00.917 --> 28:02.841
Leave his dress alone.

28:11.884 --> 28:13.351
Drink?

28:13.419 --> 28:17.956
Well, I'm actually on kind of
a wine-only diet right now.

28:18.024 --> 28:20.058
Is red ok?
Because we've got plenty of that.

28:20.126 --> 28:20.926
Yeah.

28:20.993 --> 28:21.626
All right.

28:21.694 --> 28:22.961
Sorry about the bat.

28:23.029 --> 28:27.732
This arson situation
has us on our toes.

28:27.800 --> 28:31.799
Sister Rosemary sleeps with
a knife under her pillow.

28:33.973 --> 28:38.777
So...They're thinking
it might be arson, huh?

28:38.844 --> 28:40.595
So says the marshal.

28:42.348 --> 28:44.149
I'd say, "who would
want to burn a church?"

28:44.217 --> 28:46.785
But then again, who hasn't
wanted to burn a church

28:46.852 --> 28:48.753
every once in a while?

28:49.520 --> 28:56.096
It's so easy for people to hate the things
they don't understand instead of loving them.

28:56.607 --> 28:58.354
You and I both know...

28:58.474 --> 29:01.933
that most people, especially
in this country, are lazy

29:02.001 --> 29:04.403
self-obsessed slobs.

29:04.446 --> 29:06.813
Thomas Gavin doesn't take
the easy way, does he?

29:07.349 --> 29:12.119
Well, to be honest with you,
father, if there was an easy way out,

29:12.239 --> 29:15.089
I'd probably take it
in a heartbeat, you know.

29:15.157 --> 29:17.524
Nah, I don't think so.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.229
And I don't think you
came out here tonight

29:21.296 --> 29:23.764
to talk about the fire.

29:23.832 --> 29:26.067
No, I didn't.

29:26.134 --> 29:32.707
Um... you know, to be honest again,
father, I'm not the world's

29:32.774 --> 29:34.175
greatest catholic.

29:37.822 --> 29:40.915
But I've had this thing
lately, recently,

29:40.983 --> 29:44.770
this life-altering experience.

29:45.659 --> 29:49.123
I won't go into all
the details, but I...

29:49.191 --> 29:53.361
I died, and I went briefly,
I think, to the other side.

29:53.428 --> 29:57.398
And you know, what I do
for a living, you know,

29:57.466 --> 30:01.135
we see a lot of stuff, a lot of...
A lot of bad things,

30:01.203 --> 30:02.803
you know.

30:02.871 --> 30:04.305
Hell on earth.

30:04.373 --> 30:08.709
You'd think. But when I...
When I had this experience,

30:08.777 --> 30:11.679
I'm telling you, when I went to
that other side, I saw things

30:11.747 --> 30:13.981
that make the things I see
at work just seem like

30:14.049 --> 30:16.517
a bad day at the beach,
I'm telling you.

30:16.585 --> 30:18.586
You think you went to hell.

30:18.654 --> 30:21.656
Well, either I went to hell,
or I went to the shittiest

30:21.723 --> 30:24.025
beach... I didn't mean to say that.
I'm sorry.

30:24.092 --> 30:27.495
I didn't...
It doesn't mean shit to me.

30:27.562 --> 30:29.931
Ah. Ok.

30:30.934 --> 30:38.372
So, you know, I went over there,
and I saw...I don't know. So...

30:38.440 --> 30:41.776
So...What now?

30:41.843 --> 30:43.778
Right.

30:47.749 --> 30:50.242
What?
You want me to tell you?

30:52.197 --> 30:55.323
Yeah. I thought that...
I thought you might have some answers.

30:55.390 --> 30:57.350
No. Nobody can answer
that question.

30:59.254 --> 31:01.584
- Um, but I thought you guys...
- No, nobody but you, anyway.

31:02.894 --> 31:07.260
No, this is what I do know...
That in times of duress

31:07.380 --> 31:10.838
like these, we have to find stability.
We have to

31:10.906 --> 31:13.026
solidify our grounding.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.812
Who is one person that's
been there with you

31:17.879 --> 31:19.886
through the thick and the thin?

31:22.184 --> 31:23.713
Through my adult life?

31:25.187 --> 31:26.854
Hmm...

31:30.492 --> 31:32.460
Tommy, it's not a hard question.

31:32.527 --> 31:33.594
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

31:33.662 --> 31:40.784
Um...I'm...
I would have to go with...

31:45.607 --> 31:46.707
My wife.

31:46.775 --> 31:47.641
You're married.

31:47.709 --> 31:49.677
Yes.

31:50.070 --> 31:51.645
Barely. Yeah.

31:51.713 --> 31:52.757
Kids?

31:54.049 --> 31:56.379
2 kids. 2 1/2.

31:57.552 --> 32:01.155
By...We had a kid that
died, and now I inherited

32:01.223 --> 32:07.823
my brother's son because he...
My brother died.

32:09.489 --> 32:13.467
Anything there you might
salvage, with your kids?

32:13.535 --> 32:17.104
That would be, like, some pretty...
A pretty deep dive.

32:17.172 --> 32:19.974
I mean, by...
Especially with my wife.

32:20.042 --> 32:23.377
It's kind of shark-infested waters.

32:23.445 --> 32:25.646
You got a picture?

32:25.714 --> 32:27.696
Um...Yeah.

32:29.184 --> 32:31.233
Um, let me see.

32:32.354 --> 32:37.142
These are...The girls.

32:37.959 --> 32:41.095
I don't have a picture of the baby.

32:41.163 --> 32:42.830
And that's...That's my wife.

32:42.898 --> 32:45.099
It looks like that's been
through the wash a few times.

32:45.167 --> 32:46.692
Yeah.

32:48.703 --> 32:50.037
Wow.

32:50.105 --> 32:51.395
Yeah.

32:54.242 --> 32:57.082
When's the last time you took
a good look at this picture?

32:57.779 --> 32:59.980
I just looked at it when
I was giving it to you.

33:00.048 --> 33:01.484
Well, take another look.

33:06.354 --> 33:09.722
No, Tommy, I really want you
to take a good look at it.

33:11.626 --> 33:13.609
Really look at it.

33:14.971 --> 33:16.233
I'm looking at it.

33:16.353 --> 33:18.725
Well, it's been a long time since
I've known the company of a woman,

33:18.845 --> 33:19.982
other than Sister Rosemary.

33:20.102 --> 33:22.269
But I can tell by just looking
at that picture, that that is a woman

33:22.337 --> 33:24.138
you don't let slip away.

33:24.206 --> 33:26.841
That is a woman you tussle for.

33:26.908 --> 33:34.175
So maybe...
Maybe, that's "what now?"

33:36.785 --> 33:38.399
Can I keep this?

33:40.738 --> 33:43.824
Well, that's the only...
That's the only copy I have

33:43.892 --> 33:47.528
of that particular...
photograph, so I kind of...

33:47.596 --> 33:49.294
I need it, you know.

33:50.799 --> 33:52.133
You sure?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.051
Yeah. That's it.

33:57.139 --> 33:58.706
Thanks.

34:05.547 --> 34:06.614
Thank you very much.

34:06.681 --> 34:08.206
It was...

34:10.051 --> 34:12.112
24/7. Always open.

34:13.655 --> 34:15.188
Thank you, Franco.

34:15.257 --> 34:16.322
No problem.

34:16.391 --> 34:18.993
Of course, the moment that I need
Tommy, he goes off the radar,

34:19.060 --> 34:21.262
and here you are, taking
care of business.

34:21.329 --> 34:23.164
Yeah. Well, that's his M.O., right?

34:23.231 --> 34:26.467
Yeah.
Where would I be without you?

34:26.534 --> 34:28.369
From the looks of things,
probably washing your dishes

34:28.436 --> 34:30.356
in the bathtub.

34:31.438 --> 34:33.007
Speaking of, I'm very dirty.

34:33.074 --> 34:35.543
I'm going to do a quick change.
Ok?

34:35.610 --> 34:37.677
Yeah, sure. Take your time.

34:40.114 --> 34:41.715
Hey. How's Lou doing?

34:41.783 --> 34:44.118
Oh, he's, uh...
He's all right, I guess.

34:44.186 --> 34:46.920
He could probably stand to
exercise a little bit more.

34:46.987 --> 34:48.989
A little less food, you know.

34:50.358 --> 34:52.592
That's no secret.

34:53.978 --> 35:00.234
Yeah.
You know, he could eat better.

35:00.302 --> 35:05.039
Maybe take fewer naps or...
Something.

35:05.106 --> 35:07.875
Yeah. I really should have
visited him in the hospital.

35:07.943 --> 35:12.046
Yeah. Well, you know, I'm
sure he forgives you.

35:24.793 --> 35:26.894
Oh, goddamn! Shit!

35:26.962 --> 35:30.097
Hey, are you ok?

35:30.165 --> 35:31.981
I cut myself.

35:32.101 --> 35:34.971
- Damn it.
- God, you're bleeding.

35:35.670 --> 35:36.870
It's not that bad.

35:36.938 --> 35:38.339
It's like a nick, you know.

35:38.406 --> 35:39.139
Does that hurt?

35:39.207 --> 35:41.442
Yeah, a little bit. Ha.

35:41.509 --> 35:43.444
I'm all right.

35:43.511 --> 35:44.945
Sorry.

36:01.529 --> 36:04.732
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

36:04.799 --> 36:06.033
Janet, I am so sorry.

36:06.101 --> 36:07.301
I am so sorry.

36:07.369 --> 36:08.869
That was so far out of line.

36:08.937 --> 36:11.472
I don't even... it's like some
kind of weird sickness with me,

36:11.539 --> 36:12.840
you know. I mean, Jesus Christ.

36:12.907 --> 36:14.141
You're Tommy's wife.

36:14.209 --> 36:15.709
You know, he's my friend.

36:15.777 --> 36:18.512
I don't even know what...
I'm sorry.

36:18.580 --> 36:20.648
No, there's nothing to be sorry about.

36:20.715 --> 36:21.348
Yeah, you know what?

36:21.416 --> 36:23.651
There is. Ok?
Because, you know, that was low,

36:23.718 --> 36:26.754
even for me. I've gone to depths
that would kill most men, so...

36:26.821 --> 36:29.390
Seriously, stop beating yourself up.
Ok? It's...

36:29.457 --> 36:31.351
Look, nothing happened.

36:32.694 --> 36:36.563
Yeah. Yeah, I guess, you know.
I mean, it's not like I threw you

36:36.631 --> 36:39.556
up on the counter or
something, you know.

36:41.997 --> 36:45.480
You know, it's not like Tommy
and I are even officially together.

36:46.119 --> 36:50.210
Ok? So don't...
You know, I'm not saying that...

36:50.278 --> 36:54.815
Right. Yeah. I mean...
Of course not.

36:54.883 --> 36:58.333
- So, I mean...
- Hey.

36:58.453 --> 36:59.687
Hey.

36:59.754 --> 37:01.188
What are you doing here?

37:01.256 --> 37:05.259
Oh, you know, just... you, uh...
You have a busted...

37:05.851 --> 37:08.028
A clogged pipe, you know, drain.

37:08.096 --> 37:10.531
Yeah.
And so I called him to fix it.

37:10.598 --> 37:13.867
- She tried to call you, but, you know...
- Well, he was close by.

37:13.935 --> 37:16.100
So he came...by.

37:16.220 --> 37:19.873
I didn't want you to get your floor,
you know, wet... or ruined.

37:19.941 --> 37:21.431
And then he cut himself.

37:22.043 --> 37:22.876
You all right?

37:22.944 --> 37:23.911
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm good.

37:23.978 --> 37:26.280
You know, it's, uh...
It's nothing, you know.

37:26.348 --> 37:28.462
I think, you know, you
might have a little, um...

37:28.925 --> 37:30.250
Like, rust under there.

37:30.318 --> 37:31.129
Hmm.

37:31.720 --> 37:32.789
How was your day?

37:34.230 --> 37:35.182
It was good.

37:36.358 --> 37:37.182
Good.

37:37.826 --> 37:38.733
Good.

37:52.741 --> 37:54.141
What?

38:01.400 --> 38:05.773
You two have got...
to be shitting me.

38:10.525 --> 38:14.194
- Tom, what are you...
- Oh, ho.

38:14.262 --> 38:15.696
T.

38:16.587 --> 38:18.098
Tommy.

38:18.166 --> 38:20.968
Un...believable.

38:21.035 --> 38:22.202
You got the wrong idea, man.

38:22.270 --> 38:23.404
I...
