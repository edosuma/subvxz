WEBVTT

00:04.681 --> 00:07.165
So, you finished <i>90 Dances, 90 Nations</i>
huh?

00:07.190 --> 00:08.278
Um... ***

00:08.297 --> 00:09.968
My dad's new girlfriend
is quite the offer.

00:10.005 --> 00:11.300
Yeah, I love it.

00:11.702 --> 00:12.766
How did you...
I don't know...

00:12.791 --> 00:14.830
summarize the character
to the plot?

00:14.855 --> 00:16.094
You haven't read it, have you?

00:16.097 --> 00:17.530
(sighs) It's 800 pages

00:17.532 --> 00:18.864
of a woman recovering
from her divorce

00:18.866 --> 00:20.099
by dancing around the globe.

00:20.101 --> 00:21.567
Could you just give me
the CliffsNotes, please?

00:21.569 --> 00:23.035
My dad's bringing her by
after lunch.

00:23.037 --> 00:25.705
Well, it was subtle
with its complex narrative

00:25.707 --> 00:28.207
- and thematic prose.
- You didn't read it either.

00:28.209 --> 00:29.508
It is 800 pages.

00:29.510 --> 00:31.043
I've been trying to download
the audio book

00:31.045 --> 00:32.211
for the last 12 hours.

00:32.213 --> 00:33.546
ANDREW: Oh, hey, I cannot
thank you guys enough

00:33.548 --> 00:35.614
for turning me on
to Lily's book.

00:35.616 --> 00:36.916
I mean, I may not be

00:36.918 --> 00:38.584
a middle-aged divorcée,

00:38.586 --> 00:40.519
but color me swept away.

00:40.521 --> 00:42.188
Yeah, and all the dancing.

00:42.190 --> 00:43.622
Dancing.

00:43.624 --> 00:44.924
Dancing? There was no dancing.

00:44.926 --> 00:46.158
The dancing was a metaphor

00:46.160 --> 00:47.993
for her emotional catharsis.

00:47.995 --> 00:49.828
Paco the farm boy makes that
very clear in chapter 6.

00:49.830 --> 00:51.230
You didn't read it.

00:51.232 --> 00:53.199
Yeah, I didn't either.
You know me.

00:53.201 --> 00:55.267
I drift reading the back
of a mac and cheese box.

00:55.269 --> 00:57.403
So, how is it going
with Lily and your dad?

00:57.405 --> 00:58.737
Um, pretty well, I think.

00:58.739 --> 00:59.905
I mean, you know, he's cautious.

00:59.907 --> 01:01.707
He likes to take things
nice and slow.

01:01.709 --> 01:03.642
(elevator bell dings)

01:03.644 --> 01:04.977
Or slutty and quick.

01:06.913 --> 01:07.946
(clears throat) Dad?

01:07.948 --> 01:09.314
(gasps) Oh!

01:09.316 --> 01:10.549
Hey, gang.

01:10.551 --> 01:13.185
May I present
Ms. Lily Schecter,

01:13.187 --> 01:15.954
the author of
<i>90 Dances, 90 Nations.</i>

01:15.956 --> 01:17.389
And I was worried
that meeting all of you

01:17.391 --> 01:18.457
might be awkward.

01:18.459 --> 01:19.491
(laughter)

01:19.493 --> 01:20.792
So you must be Sydney.

01:20.794 --> 01:22.094
I can tell

01:22.096 --> 01:23.428
because you look
the most horrified.

01:23.430 --> 01:25.597
Uh, no, no, we're just
real excited to meet you.

01:25.599 --> 01:27.032
- We loved your book.
- Couldn't put it down.

01:27.034 --> 01:28.433
- Read it in a night.
- I actually read it.

01:28.435 --> 01:30.569
Oh, how kind.
Did you have a favorite part?

01:30.571 --> 01:32.638
- Yes I did, because I actually read it.
- Chapter 12.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.706
Chen-Lu with the...
the Sea of Japan was...

01:34.708 --> 01:35.941
Oh, so you're all liars.

01:35.943 --> 01:37.342
It's okay.

01:37.344 --> 01:38.377
I forgive you.

01:38.379 --> 01:39.811
Well, I promise,

01:39.813 --> 01:42.547
<i>90 Dances, 90 Nations</i> is
at the top of my must-read list

01:42.549 --> 01:44.549
once I stop being a workaholic.

01:44.551 --> 01:46.618
Oh, Sydney, if I could give you
one piece of advice

01:46.620 --> 01:48.286
that I've learned
on all of my life travels,

01:48.288 --> 01:50.422
it's that you have got
to slow down a little bit.

01:50.424 --> 01:52.424
You need to cut out
some time for yourself.

01:52.426 --> 01:54.226
You know,
just take a breath and...

01:54.228 --> 01:55.794
(gasps) Balls!

01:55.796 --> 01:57.262
I've got a meeting
in 15 minutes.

01:57.264 --> 01:59.865
It's at a women's shelter.

01:59.867 --> 02:00.932
I mean, it's kind of a bummer

02:00.934 --> 02:02.434
because none of them
can afford my book.

02:02.436 --> 02:03.668
That was so mean.

02:03.670 --> 02:04.903
I'm really a nice person.

02:04.905 --> 02:06.805
So we're on for Thursday?
Absolutely.

02:06.807 --> 02:08.573
It's a date. No...

02:08.574 --> 02:10.008
An adventure.

02:11.243 --> 02:13.712
(hisses)

02:13.714 --> 02:15.413
So, what's the big plan
for the date on Thursday?

02:15.415 --> 02:16.481
Nothing too fancy.

02:16.483 --> 02:17.882
Only the greatest
night of romance

02:17.884 --> 02:19.150
anyone ever had.

02:19.152 --> 02:20.685
And of course,
a magical ending.

02:20.687 --> 02:22.187
Oh, I wouldn't put
that much pressure

02:22.189 --> 02:23.588
on yourself.

02:23.590 --> 02:24.923
The first time's
not always magical.

02:24.925 --> 02:26.391
Sometimes it's over
really quick,

02:26.393 --> 02:28.293
but then you don't have
to retake geometry.

02:28.295 --> 02:30.094
Oh, there's a lot of story
in that little sentence.

02:30.096 --> 02:32.664
(man sobbing) Does anyone
else hear someone crying?

02:32.666 --> 02:33.865
Yeah, I'd know
those ugly wails anywhere.

02:33.867 --> 02:35.233
That's Gordon.

02:38.404 --> 02:40.104
Gordon, is that you cr...

02:40.106 --> 02:41.773
Oh! (grunts)

02:41.775 --> 02:44.008
(groans) Timothy kicked me out.

02:44.010 --> 02:45.877
My marriage is over.

02:45.879 --> 02:47.845
Ow! That really hurt.

03:05.999 --> 03:08.299
- Bubbe, what happened?
- I don't know,

03:08.301 --> 03:10.861
but I think I really hurt
myself when I tripped...

03:11.937 --> 03:13.671
Gordon, what happened?

03:13.673 --> 03:15.506
I don't know what happened.

03:15.508 --> 03:17.541
- We were eating Thai food.
- Uh-huh.

03:17.543 --> 03:18.843
Everything was fine. We were...

03:18.845 --> 03:20.544
We were reading listicles
on Buzzfeed.

03:20.546 --> 03:23.881
- Yeah? - “Top 25 Ways You
Know You're a '90s Girl.”

03:23.883 --> 03:25.449
And that's when Timothy,

03:25.451 --> 03:28.386
he threw all my stuff out
on the front lawn!

03:28.388 --> 03:30.354
(sobs) 20 years!

03:30.356 --> 03:32.823
We have a dog!

03:32.825 --> 03:33.958
Don't you worry

03:33.960 --> 03:35.526
about Dr. Katherine
Lewis Salazar Ruffington.

03:35.528 --> 03:37.127
That dog is gonna be just fine.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.262
Take the rest
of the day off, okay?

03:38.264 --> 03:40.164
Here.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.599
Go to my place.

03:41.601 --> 03:43.500
Get some sleep;
I'll check in on you later.

03:43.502 --> 03:45.970
Do you think people will know
I've been crying?

03:45.972 --> 03:46.971
Oh, here, you know what?

03:46.973 --> 03:48.973
You can wear my glasses.
(sighs)

03:48.975 --> 03:50.941
Thank you.

03:50.943 --> 03:52.810
I don't want them
to make fun of me.

03:52.812 --> 03:54.044
Get out of here, go, go, go.

03:54.046 --> 03:55.379
Okay.

03:55.381 --> 03:57.948
Oh. Careful. My, my...

03:57.950 --> 03:59.750
(sighs)

03:59.752 --> 04:01.585
Hey, buddy.

04:01.587 --> 04:03.454
- Hey, friend.
- Oh...

04:03.456 --> 04:06.256
- You dropped these.
- No, those aren't mine.

04:06.258 --> 04:08.792
- So, how was that place for lunch?
- Are you...

04:08.794 --> 04:11.395
Are you seriously just
gonna leave them there?

04:11.397 --> 04:13.697
Well, what do you do when
you've lost something?

04:13.699 --> 04:14.998
You retrace your steps.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.767
First place they'll look:
floor of the elevator.

04:16.769 --> 04:19.670
You're unbelievable.
Uh, yeah, it's easier

04:19.672 --> 04:21.605
to turn a blind eye
and look the other way,

04:21.607 --> 04:23.907
- but as a society we rely on the...
- Look, may-maybe the keys...

04:23.909 --> 04:26.510
are supposed to
stay on the floor.

04:26.512 --> 04:28.445
All right, have you seen
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

04:28.447 --> 04:31.014
Do you remember the scene when Marty's
mom gets all handsy with him in the car?

04:31.016 --> 04:32.215
His sister's head disappears.

04:32.217 --> 04:33.750
You want that
on your conscience?

04:33.752 --> 04:35.218
So you're equating
picking up a set of keys

04:35.220 --> 04:36.820
with messing with
the space-time continuum?

04:36.822 --> 04:38.902
Let's just hope
it's not too late already.

04:42.494 --> 04:44.494
SIMON:
<i>Okay, let me get this straight:</i>

04:44.496 --> 04:46.596
There were no infidelities?

04:46.598 --> 04:49.499
No drug or alcohol problems?
Look, we were fine.

04:49.501 --> 04:51.635
We even celebrated
his birthday last week.

04:51.637 --> 04:53.236
What'd you do?
What we always do.

04:53.238 --> 04:55.639
I took him to Outback Steakhouse
because he doesn't like rules.

04:55.641 --> 04:56.673
And that was his idea?

04:56.675 --> 04:59.342
No, he wanted me
to sing Bearaoke.

04:59.344 --> 05:02.012
It's like karaoke
but with big, hairy, gay men.

05:02.014 --> 05:04.447
I always thought that was karaoke
with Barry Manilow songs.

05:04.449 --> 05:06.016
That's Manilowke.

05:06.018 --> 05:08.952
Ah. Anyway, after dinner, I
gave him his Amazon gift card

05:08.954 --> 05:10.019
and everything seemed fine.

05:10.021 --> 05:11.287
I just figured out the problem.

05:11.289 --> 05:12.355
You're not spontaneous.

05:12.357 --> 05:13.857
That's what Timothy says.

05:13.859 --> 05:15.558
Why didn't you tell me that
before I started guessing?

05:15.560 --> 05:17.994
Because I thought you were
looking for something secret.

05:17.996 --> 05:22.332
Okay, l-look, here's what
Timothy always complains about.

05:22.334 --> 05:23.933
That I never like
to go out anymore,

05:23.935 --> 05:27.470
that I never try, do,
or eat anything new.

05:27.472 --> 05:29.806
And that I still haven't gotten
the mole on my back looked at.

05:29.808 --> 05:32.241
Well, this is great news. Not the
mole... that's potentially fatal...

05:32.243 --> 05:34.077
but everything else
I can help you with.

05:34.079 --> 05:36.179
Spontaneity is my specialty.

05:36.181 --> 05:38.114
- And you think that's gonna get him back?
- Of course.

05:38.116 --> 05:41.384
We'll have you violating the sanctity of
marriage in no time. We'll start tomorrow.

05:41.386 --> 05:43.119
- Okay, but I have to know
what time. - Oh, no, no.

05:43.121 --> 05:44.487
I have a waxing...
(glass shatters)

05:44.489 --> 05:46.823
- You can't plan spontaneity.
- Why would you do that?

05:46.825 --> 05:49.592
Think of the first thing that comes
to mind. I didn't get insurance

05:49.594 --> 05:51.554
- on the phone.
- That's a start.

05:57.336 --> 06:00.238
Boys, in order to shake Gordon
out of his comfort zone and help

06:00.240 --> 06:02.206
him win Timothy back,
he's gonna be joining our

06:02.208 --> 06:03.474
brainstorming session.

06:03.476 --> 06:06.010
Okay, our product is SmartSpecs.

06:06.012 --> 06:08.546
It's basically a rip-off
of Google Glass,

06:08.548 --> 06:11.182
- except they look just like
- regular glasses. Mm-hmm.

06:11.184 --> 06:13.151
Basically, it's a computer
you wear on your face.

06:13.153 --> 06:15.086
So you can search the Internet,
take videos, whatever.

06:15.088 --> 06:16.721
Gordon, hold these in your hand.

06:16.723 --> 06:19.657
- Mm-hmm. - Now say the first thing
that comes to mind. Don't think.

06:19.659 --> 06:22.260
I-I-I... I don't know.
I'm not good at this.

06:22.262 --> 06:24.061
Nonsense. Anything that comes
out of that Mardi Gras float

06:24.063 --> 06:25.730
you call a head
is gonna be brilliant.

06:25.732 --> 06:27.031
Okay, see, now, that was mean.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.833
- Yet encouraging. Thank you.
- Well, I want

06:28.835 --> 06:30.267
you to succeed.
You're my friend, okay?

06:30.269 --> 06:32.069
Besides, I'm having a big date
with Lily this weekend

06:32.071 --> 06:34.171
and I don't want you all
up in my kitchen, all right?

06:34.173 --> 06:36.273
So, go from your gut.

06:36.275 --> 06:37.742
- What would you use these for?
- I-I...

06:37.744 --> 06:39.210
wouldn't know where to begin.

06:39.212 --> 06:40.678
Um, you could do anything.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.680
- That's it.
- What's it?

06:42.682 --> 06:45.549
- You could do anything. - Not much of a pitch.
Don't we have to be more specific?

06:45.551 --> 06:46.951
Maybe you don't.
Maybe it's something new.

06:46.953 --> 06:48.586
Maybe it's
an anti-idea.

06:48.588 --> 06:50.120
A celebration of vagueness.

07:28.861 --> 07:31.628
it was a severely mild sprain.
But it's the worst kind.

07:31.630 --> 07:34.231
Any more severe and it would
have been officially moderate.

07:34.233 --> 07:35.499
Well, he did give you crutches.

07:35.501 --> 07:37.534
I-I might have picked them up
on my own accord.

07:37.536 --> 07:39.202
And a good patient
is her own advocate.

07:39.204 --> 07:40.303
Real or drama queen?

07:40.305 --> 07:42.339
Second one. Drama queen. Got it.

07:42.341 --> 07:45.609
Hey, either of you ladies
missing a set of keys?

07:45.611 --> 07:48.512
Those belong to Jean
from payroll.

07:48.514 --> 07:50.213
- How do you know that?
- Well, see

07:50.215 --> 07:52.282
the little pair of jeans
hanging from the keychain?

07:52.284 --> 07:55.385
That's her signature,
because her name is Jean.

07:56.195 --> 07:58.755
Signatures don't
have to be clever.

07:58.757 --> 07:59.856
Who's Jean?

07:59.858 --> 08:02.459
You don't know Jean?

08:02.461 --> 08:04.427
They call her the human tick.

08:04.429 --> 08:06.830
Okay, you can't talk to her,
you can't even look at her.

08:06.832 --> 08:09.132
Because she will take
the smallest human interaction

08:09.134 --> 08:11.568
and attach to you
like tick to deer.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.203
I once held a door open
for her and ended up

08:13.205 --> 08:16.072
invited to her cousin's
wedding in Vermont.

08:16.074 --> 08:18.742
I told him to... this is what
happens when you have no respect

08:18.744 --> 08:20.677
for the space-time continuum.
You know what?

08:20.679 --> 08:23.146
The world I live in,
a man returns a set of keys.

08:23.148 --> 08:25.215
And wears a smart suit
for airplane travel.

08:25.217 --> 08:27.951
But one problem at a time.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.787
(exhales)

08:30.789 --> 08:33.022
(whistling)

08:39.462 --> 08:42.198
Andrew Keaneally,
are those my keys?

08:42.200 --> 08:44.334
Yes, they are.
You are such a dear.

08:44.336 --> 08:46.569
I was just looking for them
in the elevator.

08:46.571 --> 08:47.937
Ah. Retracing your steps.

08:47.939 --> 08:49.806
Yeah.
Well, um, I should get going.

08:49.808 --> 08:51.274
Oh, no, you don't.

08:51.276 --> 08:53.076
I am buying you lunch

08:53.078 --> 08:55.211
as a thank you and I will not
take no for an answer.

08:55.213 --> 08:58.114
Gosh, I've already got lunch
plans at my desk, alone.

08:58.116 --> 08:59.649
Great, I'll join you.
Oh...

08:59.651 --> 09:01.284
I was supposed to
eat with Shirley

09:01.286 --> 09:02.552
but she's sick again today.

09:02.554 --> 09:05.321
What's wrong with her?
Lyme disease.

09:05.323 --> 09:08.057
7:55.

09:08.059 --> 09:10.326
You want to make small talk
like Timothy and I do

09:10.328 --> 09:11.894
before <i> NCIS</i> starts,

09:11.896 --> 09:14.597
at which point
a cone of silence is triggered?

09:14.599 --> 09:17.266
Hey, Gordon, how about we
throw caution to the wind

09:17.268 --> 09:18.668
tonight, okay?
Have a little party?

09:18.670 --> 09:20.836
I've got some new neighbors
I want you to meet.

09:20.838 --> 09:22.071
Oh, uh, uh, uh, no, no.

09:22.073 --> 09:23.572
No, I can't meet anybody
I don't know already.

09:23.574 --> 09:25.975
What was Timothy's
number one complaint?

09:25.977 --> 09:27.276
You don't socialize.
Well-well, that's

09:27.278 --> 09:29.945
'cause I need to research
people before I meet them.

09:29.947 --> 09:32.648
You... M... You know, come on.
(doorbell rings)

09:32.650 --> 09:34.250
Oh, they're here. Surprise!

09:34.252 --> 09:36.485
No time for research, got to improvise.
No, no, Simon.

09:36.487 --> 09:37.953
What did you do? Simon!
Nothing.

09:37.955 --> 09:40.322
Do-don't get it.
Shh.

09:40.324 --> 09:41.891
Welcome,<i> bienvenido, bonsoir.</i>

09:41.893 --> 09:44.293
<i>Cabaret,</i> right?
The Mac welcome screen.

09:44.295 --> 09:46.528
Anna and Neal, my new neighbors,
meet Gordon, my dear friend.

09:46.530 --> 09:49.865
Gordie, tell them a little
something about yourself.

09:50.934 --> 09:54.837
I-I should be watching
<i>NCIS</i> right now.

09:54.839 --> 09:56.605
Huh.

10:00.191 --> 10:02.942
So the plan is get married here
and then a ten-day honeymoon

10:02.944 --> 10:07.046
- in Costa Rica. - Honeymooning
in Costa Rica?

10:07.048 --> 10:09.649
Well, there's plenty
to do there. Many people

10:09.651 --> 10:12.285
enjoy the seaside community

10:12.287 --> 10:15.321
of Manuel Antonio
and then go ziplining

10:15.323 --> 10:18.191
in the village town
of Monteverde.

10:18.193 --> 10:21.994
That's fantastic. Is Manuel
Antonio far from Monteverde?

10:21.996 --> 10:26.632
Is Manuel Antonio
far from Monteverde?

10:26.634 --> 10:29.135
It's a two-and-a-half hour
ride on a dirt road,

10:29.137 --> 10:32.271
but is also accessible
via shuttles

10:32.273 --> 10:34.774
from most of the major hotels.

10:34.776 --> 10:36.842
Look at you riffing.
You're like the Miles Davis

10:36.844 --> 10:38.244
of small talk.
You're killing it.

10:38.246 --> 10:41.981
So, Neal, tell us,
what's it like, uh,

10:41.983 --> 10:43.549
growing up in Dearborn,
Michigan?

10:43.551 --> 10:45.384
Well... I understand it was

10:45.386 --> 10:47.720
founded in 1786

10:47.722 --> 10:50.423
and incorporated
as a city in... scroll...

10:50.425 --> 10:52.758
1929.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.327
- Did you just say “scroll”?
- What?

10:55.329 --> 10:59.031
No. Scroll? Hello? (laughs)

10:59.033 --> 11:00.399
I said “stroll.”

11:00.401 --> 11:05.170
As in, the residents of Dearborn,
Michigan stroll through...

11:05.172 --> 11:07.306
reload page...

11:07.308 --> 11:08.807
Ford Woods Park.

11:08.809 --> 11:10.142
You're wearing SmartSpecs!

11:10.144 --> 11:12.544
What are you talking about?
Open new tab.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.479
Topic changers.

11:13.481 --> 11:15.381
Give me those!
Give it to me.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.116
Wait just a second.
Wait just a second.

11:17.118 --> 11:19.618
You're cheating!
You're on Wikipedia!

11:19.620 --> 11:21.420
And this page
is not even verified!

11:21.422 --> 11:22.888
I told you I'm not comfortable
socializing

11:22.890 --> 11:24.156
in front of strangers.
Forgive me.

11:24.158 --> 11:25.657
Uh-oh.
What? What is it?

11:25.659 --> 11:27.159
Nothing, nothing. No, no,
don't tell me “nothing.”

11:27.161 --> 11:30.229
No, don't... Don't! Give
it to me Give it to me.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.097
- Okay, it's an Instagram alert.
- Mm-hmm.

11:32.099 --> 11:33.932
Timothy, how could you?

11:33.934 --> 11:35.767
- Who's Timothy?
- My ex.

11:35.769 --> 11:38.070
He posted a picture
of our beagle,

11:38.072 --> 11:41.506
Dr. Katherine Salazar
Lewis Ruffington.

11:41.508 --> 11:44.743
He took my last name out of
the middle name of our dog.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.311
Maybe Instagram has
a character limit.

11:46.313 --> 11:47.713
- No, that's Twitter.
- Shut up, Neal.

11:47.715 --> 11:48.847
Doesn't mean anything, Gordon.

11:48.849 --> 11:50.816
It means everything.
He's given up on us.

11:50.818 --> 11:52.317
Doesn't mean you
have to give up.

11:52.319 --> 11:53.819
- It's done, Simon.
- No, no!

11:53.821 --> 11:55.420
You don't know that,
Gordon! Come on now.

11:55.422 --> 11:57.155
Now is not the time to throw
in the tow.

11:57.157 --> 11:59.558
Take a risk, show him how
much you love him.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.659
Win him back!

12:00.661 --> 12:02.327
Oh, so you're
the relationship expert now.

12:02.329 --> 12:04.329
What are you, 0 for 5
in the marriages?

12:04.331 --> 12:05.697
Six if you count
my Moonie wedding.

12:05.699 --> 12:06.865
But at least I tried.

12:06.867 --> 12:09.501
And tried and tried.
And what have we learned?

12:09.503 --> 12:11.069
That love doesn't last.

12:11.071 --> 12:12.103
It dies.

12:12.105 --> 12:13.538
No exceptions.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.341
Except for you two.

12:16.343 --> 12:18.376
Have a great time
in Costa Rica, where...

12:18.378 --> 12:20.111
click link...

12:20.113 --> 12:22.781
“some of the world's best tarpon
fishing could be found

12:22.783 --> 12:26.117
on the Peñas Blancas.”

12:26.119 --> 12:28.319
I don't know what that means.

12:32.591 --> 12:33.525
(speaks indistinctly)

12:33.527 --> 12:35.688
Hey, guys, you remember Jean.

12:36.395 --> 12:38.630
Just had another lunch.
Jean just made me another vest.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.099
It's a jean vest!
Like me, I'm Jean.

12:41.101 --> 12:42.367
You get it?

12:42.369 --> 12:45.370
I'll meet you at the
elevators to carpool home.

12:45.372 --> 12:47.906
That was our fourth lunch.

12:47.908 --> 12:50.108
I returned the keys
three days ago.

12:50.110 --> 12:52.510
Guess what that means.
Lesson is learned.

12:52.512 --> 12:54.379
Don't be nice, help no one.

12:54.381 --> 12:55.847
I do not accept that.

12:55.849 --> 12:57.248
You're not that guy.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.183
I need you to be
Andrew the Good.

12:59.185 --> 13:01.486
We gotta find a way out
of this Jean situation.

13:01.488 --> 13:03.654
Well, all a tick needs
is a good blood meal.

13:03.656 --> 13:05.390
Maybe we just find
her a new host.

13:05.392 --> 13:07.492
SYDNEY: These crutches are
starting to hurt my shoulder.

13:07.494 --> 13:09.227
Oh, no, you don't think
it's the beginning

13:09.229 --> 13:10.895
of a mild rotator cuff
injury, do you?

13:10.897 --> 13:12.163
MAN:
I hope not.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.435
So, you created this
menu yourself?

13:17.437 --> 13:18.603
Mm-hmm.

13:18.605 --> 13:19.904
This is wonderful!

13:19.906 --> 13:21.439
Thank you.
“First course,

13:21.441 --> 13:23.241
a seven-course French meal.”

13:23.243 --> 13:25.776
It's just a little confusing,
but I love it.

13:25.778 --> 13:27.044
(chuckles)

13:27.046 --> 13:29.513
“Second course, romance.

13:29.515 --> 13:32.917
Third course,
a magical ending”"

13:32.919 --> 13:35.886
Well, I wonder what
that could be.

13:35.888 --> 13:37.588
Simon?
Hmm?

13:37.590 --> 13:41.192
Where are you?
You're really different tonight.

13:41.194 --> 13:43.027
Is there something wrong?

13:43.029 --> 13:44.829
Only that romance dies
and love is a crock.

13:44.831 --> 13:46.230
I'm having the fish.
How about you?

13:46.232 --> 13:47.565
What happened
to the guy who said

13:47.567 --> 13:49.233
that he wanted to sleep in late

13:49.235 --> 13:50.968
so he could have more
dirty dreams about me?

13:50.970 --> 13:52.369
He woke up.

13:52.371 --> 13:56.941
Wow. I, uh, I thought this was
actually going somewhere.

13:56.943 --> 13:58.842
Let me tell you
where this is going.

13:58.844 --> 14:00.244
We go out a couple more times,

14:00.246 --> 14:02.079
We start throwing the L-word
around, we get married.

14:02.081 --> 14:03.547
One morning I forget to
take out the garbage,

14:03.549 --> 14:05.316
and suddenly you try to kill me
with a kitchen knife.

14:05.318 --> 14:06.750
So why don't we cut
to the part where I say,

14:06.752 --> 14:09.453
“Check please” and we spare each
other years of misery?

14:09.455 --> 14:11.188
Did someone order some magic?

14:11.190 --> 14:12.256
You're early, Copperfield,

14:12.258 --> 14:14.258
and you're supposed
to say “abracadabra.”

14:14.260 --> 14:15.993
No one says that.
Please tell me

14:15.995 --> 14:18.495
you're here to transform this
horrible date into a good one.

14:18.497 --> 14:20.564
This must be
very embarrassing for you.

14:20.566 --> 14:23.133
It sure is.

14:31.175 --> 14:32.976
I'm leaving you now, Simon.

14:32.978 --> 14:36.046
That's what they all say.

14:40.251 --> 14:41.985
Wow, he's good.

14:45.315 --> 14:46.281
(phone rings)

14:46.283 --> 14:48.917
(ringing continues,
Sydney grunts)

14:55.057 --> 14:56.358
Hello?

14:56.360 --> 14:58.193
Sydney, is that you?

14:58.195 --> 14:59.361
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm.

14:59.363 --> 15:00.629
Where have you been all day?

15:00.631 --> 15:02.264
I was too despondent
to come into work.

15:02.266 --> 15:04.165
I'm sorry. I thought I was
calling Lauren's glasses.

15:04.167 --> 15:06.568
I need her
to bring my leather cap.

15:06.570 --> 15:07.802
I'm doing Bearaoke with Timothy

15:07.804 --> 15:09.538
and I feel like an idiot
without it.

15:09.540 --> 15:10.672
Wait... you're doing Bearaoke?

15:10.674 --> 15:12.440
No, I'm just gonna
get a sandwich.

15:12.442 --> 15:13.708
I'm talking to my dad.

15:13.710 --> 15:15.243
Yeah, I called you.

15:15.245 --> 15:16.544
- Huh?
- What?

15:16.546 --> 15:17.879
No. Why are you despondent?

15:17.881 --> 15:20.081
Well, yeah, it's this whole
thing with Timothy and...

15:20.083 --> 15:22.684
No, Gordon, I'm talking
to my dad on the glasses.

15:22.686 --> 15:24.018
He's despondent?

15:24.020 --> 15:25.887
Yes. Simon? Simon, what's...

15:25.889 --> 15:27.055
what's wrong?!

15:27.057 --> 15:29.124
Okay, you know,
why don't I give you the glasses

15:29.126 --> 15:30.792
and then you guys
can just talk directly?

15:30.794 --> 15:31.993
No! He killed love!

15:31.995 --> 15:33.461
Do not put me on
that man's face!

15:33.463 --> 15:34.696
What?
He doesn't want to talk to you.

15:34.698 --> 15:36.498
- You killed love.
- Oh, that's crazy.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.132
- Here, give me...
- No, stop!

15:38.134 --> 15:40.869
Listen, Simon, what are you
talking about, I killed...?

15:40.871 --> 15:42.003
What happened?

15:42.005 --> 15:44.105
I ended it with Lily.
What's the point?

15:44.107 --> 15:46.040
Wh-wh-why?
You were so into her.

15:46.042 --> 15:47.508
It doesn't matter.

15:47.510 --> 15:50.244
Any relationship I've ever had,
I believed it was “the one,”

15:50.246 --> 15:52.447
because I knew what Gordon
and Timothy had was possible.

15:52.449 --> 15:55.316
If they can't make it,
what chance do any of us have?

15:55.318 --> 15:56.617
Dad, that's...
What is he saying?

15:56.619 --> 15:58.486
GORDON:
Listen to me. Let me see those.

15:58.488 --> 15:59.721
Dad?
Let me see 'em.

15:59.723 --> 16:01.389
- No, he hung up.
- Where is he?

16:01.391 --> 16:02.490
I don't-I don't know.

16:02.492 --> 16:04.058
He-He broke things
off with Lily.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.393
I can't believe it.

16:05.395 --> 16:06.894
- Because of me?
- Yes.

16:06.896 --> 16:09.063
That's horrible.

16:12.501 --> 16:16.103
Okay, you can get
out of my face now.

16:17.839 --> 16:20.341
Oh, no. Look at her.
So defenseless.

16:20.343 --> 16:22.643
I got this door! (grunts)

16:22.645 --> 16:25.680
Good-bye, sweet Jean.

16:25.682 --> 16:27.348
I don't know why I kissed them.

16:27.350 --> 16:28.983
Very unsanitary.

16:34.022 --> 16:37.324
Oh, wait. Someone left
their keys here.

16:37.326 --> 16:38.893
Did anyone see my keys?

16:44.799 --> 16:48.369
Sydney Roberts, you dear!

16:48.371 --> 16:50.871
Thank you.
I am taking you

16:50.873 --> 16:52.206
to lunch, young lady!

16:52.208 --> 16:53.207
Oh!

16:53.209 --> 16:54.775
Like the weakest
little antelope.

16:54.777 --> 16:57.244
We had to sacrifice one
for the good of the pack.

16:57.246 --> 16:59.546
She'll look adorable in a jean skirt.
Hey, Syd,

16:59.548 --> 17:01.115
if you're not doing
anything this weekend...

17:01.117 --> 17:03.851
I have plans. For the next
48 weekends, I'm booked.

17:03.853 --> 17:05.919
Oh, of course.

17:05.921 --> 17:07.688
You're probably in
physical therapy for your ankle.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.857
Oh, actually, they said
I didn't need it.

17:09.858 --> 17:11.125
They don't know anything.

17:11.127 --> 17:13.493
That is a moderate sprain
if I've ever seen one.

17:13.496 --> 17:15.395
You know, that's what I said!

17:15.396 --> 17:17.564
Yeah. What do you know about
rotator cuff injuries?

17:17.566 --> 17:19.599
They need to be
taken seriously.

17:19.602 --> 17:21.969
Match made in heaven.

18:32.073 --> 18:36.743

19:41.742 --> 19:43.042
Hi, Simon.

19:43.044 --> 19:45.177
You are aware
it's after 1:00 in the morning.

19:45.179 --> 19:47.313
- Oh, yes. - Yeah.
What do you want?

19:47.315 --> 19:48.948
A very close gay friend of mine
just got back together with his partner,

19:48.950 --> 19:50.616
and I'm feeling positive
about love again.

19:50.618 --> 19:53.318
What do you say? Let's
press the reset button, huh?

19:53.320 --> 19:56.555
You know, I've always considered
myself an...

19:56.557 --> 19:58.357
open-minded kind of free spirit.

19:58.359 --> 20:00.225
- Mm-hmm. - In fact, I-I was in a committed
throuple with Woody Harrelson

20:00.227 --> 20:01.894
and his wife for three
and a half months.

20:01.896 --> 20:05.397
- Wow. - But I have never met
anybody as screwy as you.

20:05.399 --> 20:07.232
(chuckles) Y-You're like...
you're like an alien.

20:07.234 --> 20:08.967
- Really? - Call me when you
get your meds right.

20:08.969 --> 20:10.702
I'll take that as a maybe.
(groans)

20:10.704 --> 20:12.237
I'm feeling hopeful again.

20:19.245 --> 20:20.412
(woman screams)

20:20.414 --> 20:21.913
MAN:
How'd you get in here?!

20:21.915 --> 20:23.115
WOMAN:
Get out!

20:23.117 --> 20:24.383
I don't know how you
did that, Copperfield,

20:24.385 --> 20:26.084
but it's too little, too late.

20:26.086 --> 20:27.686
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help.

20:27.688 --> 20:29.121
It'd help if you picked up
your cues.

20:29.123 --> 20:31.056
This is officially the
last favor I do for you.

20:31.058 --> 20:33.325
- Don't I get three wishes? - I wish
I was taller. - I'm not a genie.

20:33.327 --> 20:36.134
- I'm not a genie. - You're still
going back in your bottle.
