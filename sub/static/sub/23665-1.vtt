01:18.700 --> 01:20.167
Joy?

01:21.636 --> 01:23.797
Yeah?

01:25.373 --> 01:26.840
You okay?

01:26.942 --> 01:28.671
Uh-huh.

01:30.177 --> 01:31.644
You sure?

01:33.647 --> 01:39.017
Ever since we got here,
you seem a little... upset.

01:39.118 --> 01:40.983
Oh, no, no.

01:41.087 --> 01:45.524
Just a little... déjà vu.

01:48.494 --> 01:51.258
They have a lot of vegetarian options here,
you know.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.829
Oh, I know.

01:52.931 --> 01:55.229
And, uh, I'm happy.

01:55.334 --> 01:57.825
Really. Promise.

01:59.837 --> 02:01.304
Okay.

02:02.472 --> 02:05.464
Well, I, um -

02:06.143 --> 02:08.043
I bought you a little present.

02:12.749 --> 02:14.876
Joy? Joy, what's wrong?

02:14.984 --> 02:17.179
I -

02:17.286 --> 02:20.380
- What? Is - Is it your period?
- No.

02:20.488 --> 02:23.423
I'm so sorry, Allen.

02:23.526 --> 02:26.256
It's okay.

02:26.361 --> 02:29.762
I'm okay.

02:29.864 --> 02:32.856
Here, let me open it now.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.038
It's an original Gainsford reproduction.

02:39.139 --> 02:41.266
Late 1880s.

02:41.375 --> 02:44.037
Oh. Where -Where did you find this?

02:44.143 --> 02:45.804
eBay.

02:45.912 --> 02:48.972
- Oh, Allen. You did this?
- Look at the side.

02:50.483 --> 02:54.078
Isn't that amazing?
I found it just like that.

02:54.186 --> 02:56.916
Antique.

02:57.022 --> 02:58.649
What, you don't like it?

03:01.292 --> 03:04.284
I'm sorry, Allen.
I didn't mean to.

03:04.396 --> 03:08.423
It's nothing.

03:08.532 --> 03:09.965
You sure?

03:10.067 --> 03:11.694
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

03:13.036 --> 03:14.833
You're welcome.

03:17.407 --> 03:18.931
Happy-

03:20.977 --> 03:22.740
Happy-

03:23.679 --> 03:25.579
Happy anniversary.

03:25.681 --> 03:29.208
Allen. Allen, I really do like it.

03:29.317 --> 03:32.445
I'm sorry. It's just -

03:32.554 --> 03:36.012
You know how you always said
a person should forgive?

03:36.124 --> 03:37.853
Forgive and forget. Yes.

03:37.959 --> 03:41.793
Well, so I thought that
I should try to be more open.

03:41.895 --> 03:43.089
Uh-huh.

03:43.196 --> 03:45.630
- 'Cause I've been really trying,Joy.
- Mm-hmm.

03:45.732 --> 03:47.825
- No more cocaine.
- Uh-uh.

03:47.934 --> 03:49.367
- No more crack.
- Uh-uh.

03:49.469 --> 03:52.029
- No more crack cocaine.
- Uh-uh.

03:52.138 --> 03:54.698
No more hanging around
doing nothing without a job.

03:54.807 --> 03:55.933
Mm-hmm.

03:56.042 --> 03:59.478
No more sarcastic remarks
or physical attacks aimed at my boss.

03:59.578 --> 04:00.875
Uh-huh.

04:00.980 --> 04:04.746
No more helping old gang members
with burglaries and armed robberies.

04:04.849 --> 04:05.474
Uh-huh.

04:05.583 --> 04:09.610
No more getting into fights with strangers,
waking up in the gutter.

04:09.720 --> 04:10.277
Uh-huh.

04:10.387 --> 04:14.346
Oh,Joy. It's been
like a never-ending struggle.

04:15.159 --> 04:20.062
And I keep fighting it,
but it's just this one thing I can't stop.

04:20.163 --> 04:22.563
- I'm trying awful hard -
- Hello.

04:22.665 --> 04:24.565
Are you ready to ord -

04:24.667 --> 04:26.498
Oh, sorry. Do you need some more time?

04:26.602 --> 04:29.264
No, no. We're ready.

04:29.372 --> 04:31.340
- Yeah.
- Um...

04:31.440 --> 04:36.002
I was wondering if you could
please tell us if you have any specials.

04:39.214 --> 04:40.681
Miss?

04:42.750 --> 04:44.217
Say again?

04:45.719 --> 04:52.318
I - I was wondering if you could please
tell us if there's any specials, I mean.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.057
What did you say?

04:56.663 --> 04:58.221
I - I, uh -

04:59.666 --> 05:02.134
I was wondering if-

05:02.234 --> 05:03.963
I know who you are.

05:05.204 --> 05:07.229
I'm-I'm sorry. Do I know -

05:09.541 --> 05:11.702
- Fuckin' pervert!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

05:11.809 --> 05:13.572
What are you wearin' underneath,
motherfuckin' scum?

05:13.678 --> 05:16.112
Miss, he's changed.
He doesn't do that anymore.

05:16.214 --> 05:18.079
We even threw out the phone book.

05:18.181 --> 05:19.808
Really. He's a different person.

05:19.916 --> 05:22.009
His voice is the same. Motherfucker.

05:33.529 --> 05:34.826
Allen?

05:35.731 --> 05:37.426
You don't still -

05:38.467 --> 05:41.265
Just -Just a little.

05:44.973 --> 05:46.497
On Sundays.

06:05.725 --> 06:07.955
"What the heck are you doing?"

06:11.196 --> 06:13.130
Oh!

06:20.271 --> 06:23.138
You know -
You know what I like about you?

06:23.240 --> 06:25.299
What? What?

06:25.409 --> 06:29.106
You're so... normal.

06:29.213 --> 06:31.010
Me?

06:31.115 --> 06:35.347
It feels so good to be with someone
who isn't... weird.

06:35.451 --> 06:37.146
Or screwed up.

06:37.253 --> 06:40.245
Or sicko-pervy.

06:41.657 --> 06:43.921
Oh. So, uh -

06:45.861 --> 06:48.853
- Are your kids off at college?
- I wish.

06:48.963 --> 06:52.490
Mine are all out of the house.
Hell, I'm out of the house.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.000
Kicked out, that is.

06:55.101 --> 06:57.296
Oh. Feeling lonely?

06:57.405 --> 06:58.872
Well -

07:00.107 --> 07:03.133
Divorce isn't easy after 35 years together.

07:03.944 --> 07:05.241
Hell.

07:06.912 --> 07:09.710
I haven't even been with a woman
outside of Marj.

07:12.084 --> 07:14.348
I'm not sure I would, uh -
would know what to do.

07:14.453 --> 07:16.648
Harvey. It's okay.

07:16.755 --> 07:17.881
It's okay.

07:17.989 --> 07:20.219
What you're feeling is normal.

07:20.325 --> 07:23.761
I can't - I can't talk about my sex life.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.795
- I can't talk about mine either.
- There's so much I don't understand.

07:26.898 --> 07:29.662
Sometimes it's better not to understand.

07:34.438 --> 07:37.498
My son, Mark- he's a great kid.

07:37.607 --> 07:41.043
You know, he's a little troubled -
just feels a little paranoid.

07:41.143 --> 07:44.510
But he's - he's really a very sweet kid.

07:44.614 --> 07:46.309
I know. Good heart.

07:46.414 --> 07:49.315
Anyway, so he moved down here.

07:50.619 --> 07:52.746
I wanted to be near him, you know...

07:52.854 --> 07:55.550
help him adjust,
make sure that he doesn't get...

07:57.925 --> 07:59.392
misinterpreted.

08:00.527 --> 08:03.189
So I moved here also.

08:03.297 --> 08:04.764
Oh.

08:06.500 --> 08:10.436
That is so... beautiful.

08:10.536 --> 08:12.060
Ah, he's a beautiful son.

08:12.171 --> 08:14.105
You're a beautiful father.

08:14.207 --> 08:16.038
- And you're -
- Don't say it.

08:17.609 --> 08:19.406
Say it.

08:24.616 --> 08:26.083
Say what?

08:26.184 --> 08:27.651
Nothing.

08:37.094 --> 08:39.221
You look like a tulip.

08:41.164 --> 08:42.461
Trish.

08:46.502 --> 08:49.699
I can't afford to fail, not again.

08:49.805 --> 08:51.796
I hate failure.

08:53.509 --> 08:55.477
More water?

08:57.312 --> 08:59.371
And for you?

09:00.814 --> 09:05.808
You know, I first met Marj
on a blind date.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.252
Bill and I met on a blind date too.

09:11.758 --> 09:15.159
- Harvey.
- Yes?

09:15.262 --> 09:17.730
Have you ever been to Israel?

09:19.198 --> 09:20.665
No. No.

09:22.435 --> 09:25.063
But it's where I want to be buried.

09:25.770 --> 09:27.465
Oh, my God.

09:28.874 --> 09:32.810
Me too. Me too.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.379
Well -

09:47.490 --> 09:50.288
- Um -
- Hey.

09:53.795 --> 09:55.820
Oh, my God.

09:55.931 --> 09:57.626
You're so not my type...

09:57.734 --> 10:00.396
but I - I don't know
what's coming over me.

10:02.070 --> 10:04.061
Love, Trish.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.638
Love.

11:02.424 --> 11:04.858
Hi, Mom.

11:04.959 --> 11:07.291
Hi, hon.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.228
- Chloe in bed?
- Yeah.

11:10.331 --> 11:13.596
But how come you're back so late?
It's after midnight.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.168
Oh, Timmy. Timmy.

11:17.471 --> 11:18.938
What?

11:21.508 --> 11:23.203
I'm in love.

11:24.610 --> 11:28.137
Really? But you just met him.

11:28.247 --> 11:29.942
I know, but -

11:30.049 --> 11:32.574
What's he like?
Is he like Dad was?

11:32.684 --> 11:35.414
Oh, no. He's totally different.

11:35.521 --> 11:37.421
Harvey's, um -

11:38.890 --> 11:41.188
Harvey's a real man.

11:41.293 --> 11:43.557
But Dad was a real man also.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.128
Yes, but -

11:46.096 --> 11:49.395
I don't know how to put this,
but it's like -

11:50.835 --> 11:54.293
He has this power.

11:56.072 --> 11:57.300
What do you mean?

11:57.407 --> 12:00.501
I mean like -

12:02.111 --> 12:05.547
He just touched me...

12:05.647 --> 12:09.583
touched my elbow right here
just like this, and -

12:10.718 --> 12:13.710
- And -
- And what?

12:15.591 --> 12:20.688
I got... wet all over.

12:22.262 --> 12:23.957
Just by touching your elbow?

12:24.064 --> 12:27.500
I know. It sounds so strange,
and it's so hard to explain.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.363
But it's like...

12:30.704 --> 12:32.899
I felt things I never knew
I could feel.

12:33.006 --> 12:34.997
Like what?

12:35.107 --> 12:36.836
Like -

12:38.177 --> 12:41.806
Like a tulip just opening her petals.

12:41.914 --> 12:44.314
You felt like a tulip?

12:44.416 --> 12:47.715
Oh, my God. What is wrong with me?

12:47.819 --> 12:50.344
How can I be
talking about this with you?

12:50.454 --> 12:52.752
What? Hello!

12:53.824 --> 12:55.621
But, Mom, why?

12:55.727 --> 12:58.696
- Why can't you explain?
- Because.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.297
You're still a child.

13:01.398 --> 13:03.491
But I'm almost -

13:03.599 --> 13:06.534
I'm almost a man.

13:06.636 --> 13:08.695
A man.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.773
Are you still wet?

13:13.875 --> 13:15.172
Oh, no. I...

13:16.745 --> 13:19.305
dried myself with a paper towel.

13:19.413 --> 13:21.108
Now come. Let's go to bed.

18:53.313 --> 18:55.076
Hello. Who is this, please?

18:57.585 --> 18:58.882
Hello?

19:00.720 --> 19:02.187
<i>Hello?</i>

19:17.034 --> 19:18.501
Oh,Joy!

19:29.779 --> 19:32.043
The schmuck! All men are schmucks.

19:32.148 --> 19:33.172
Really, he's not.

19:33.282 --> 19:37.309
We just need a little time apart
to, um, reevaluate.

19:37.420 --> 19:39.251
Wake up and smell the coffee.

19:39.355 --> 19:41.619
He's a perv through and through.

19:41.724 --> 19:44.693
Born a perv. He'll die a perv.

20:02.842 --> 20:05.310
Mom, are you okay?

20:05.412 --> 20:06.879
I'm sorry.

20:08.047 --> 20:12.040
It's just that I know
it's sadness that's brought you here.

20:12.151 --> 20:15.018
And I probably shouldn't say this, but...

20:15.120 --> 20:16.883
I'm so happy you're here.

20:17.790 --> 20:20.350
I've missed you so much.

20:21.226 --> 20:23.592
And you never visit.

20:23.695 --> 20:26.926
And I know -who am I?

20:27.031 --> 20:29.397
But I've been so lonely...

20:29.500 --> 20:32.094
since that prick, your father, left me.

20:32.202 --> 20:33.601
Oh, Mom.

20:33.704 --> 20:35.763
But what about Trish? Doesn't she -

20:35.872 --> 20:37.635
Trish has a life.

20:37.740 --> 20:40.231
She has three kids, a real job.

20:41.010 --> 20:44.207
And your other sister, Helen - I'm sorry.

20:47.582 --> 20:52.781
Now, come, you're gonna have
a whole new outlook on things.

20:52.887 --> 20:57.551
And you're never gonna want
to go back to New Jersey... ever again.

21:36.727 --> 21:39.457
<i># I heard somebody say #</i>

21:39.562 --> 21:42.895
<i># That the war ended today #</i>

<i># But everybody knows

22:30.674 --> 22:33.006
Good evening. Can I help you?

22:34.445 --> 22:36.936
Yes. I'd like to sit down.

22:37.048 --> 22:39.414
And how many are you?

22:40.818 --> 22:42.012
One.

22:42.118 --> 22:43.847
Do you have a reservation?

22:43.953 --> 22:46.183
No.

22:46.289 --> 22:48.189
Let me see what's available then.

22:51.361 --> 22:53.329
Great. Come right this way.

23:03.038 --> 23:05.233
Here now.

23:05.339 --> 23:07.534
A waiter will take care of you
in just a moment.

23:07.642 --> 23:09.837
Would you like
something to drink in the meantime?

23:12.345 --> 23:14.506
No, thank you.

23:14.614 --> 23:16.081
Great.

23:42.406 --> 23:44.601
Um, hi.

23:47.511 --> 23:48.978
Andy.

23:49.079 --> 23:51.445
Can I join you?

23:51.547 --> 23:54.516
Oh, please.

23:54.617 --> 23:56.016
Please sit down.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.290
I've missed you.

24:02.390 --> 24:04.153
Oh, God. Andy.

24:04.259 --> 24:05.726
I've missed you too.

24:05.827 --> 24:07.795
I felt so bad for what I did.

24:09.497 --> 24:11.260
It was my fault.

24:11.365 --> 24:12.662
No.

24:13.701 --> 24:15.635
No, it wasn't. It was mine.

24:15.736 --> 24:17.431
I shouldn't have -

24:19.439 --> 24:24.001
It must have taken... a lot of courage.

24:25.410 --> 24:27.105
I don't know.

24:28.281 --> 24:30.476
I was just so sad.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.414
I don't remember much.

24:33.519 --> 24:36.750
It was so long ago, but I think
I must have done it the right way...

24:36.854 --> 24:41.188
because I wasn't really conscious
of anything happening.

24:41.293 --> 24:43.523
That's good.

24:45.696 --> 24:48.790
The plastic bag was probably key.

24:48.899 --> 24:49.558
Without it -

24:49.666 --> 24:51.896
Oh. That would have been horrible.

24:52.002 --> 24:53.196
Too horrible.

24:53.304 --> 24:57.172
- You could've ended up -
- A vegetable. I know.

25:00.276 --> 25:03.245
I always felt so guilty.

25:03.345 --> 25:06.644
No. No, you shouldn't have.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.014
I -

25:10.119 --> 25:12.587
I guess I just overreacted.

25:15.156 --> 25:17.090
I should have married you.

25:17.191 --> 25:19.159
Really?

25:19.259 --> 25:21.352
You think you would have been
happy with me?

25:21.462 --> 25:24.260
It was a beautiful ashtray
that you gave me.

25:24.364 --> 25:26.355
My name engraved.

25:26.466 --> 25:29.026
Oh, I should have -

25:29.135 --> 25:30.864
I shouldn't have spoken
the way I did.

25:30.970 --> 25:33.268
I should've let you
just keep the ashtray.

25:33.372 --> 25:35.067
That's okay.

25:35.174 --> 25:38.268
Things worked out all right in the end.

25:40.445 --> 25:42.504
I - I mean -

25:44.082 --> 25:47.609
Do you miss life?

25:50.488 --> 25:53.082
I don't know.

25:53.190 --> 25:54.657
I miss -

25:56.293 --> 25:59.126
I miss my room...

26:00.129 --> 26:02.563
my laser disc collection.

26:02.665 --> 26:05.190
I spent so many years -

26:08.037 --> 26:11.370
I'm sorry I said you were shit
and I was champagne.

26:11.473 --> 26:14.533
That's okay. That's okay.

26:15.276 --> 26:17.244
Sometimes the truth -

26:19.481 --> 26:21.949
I think it's made me a better person.

26:23.751 --> 26:27.050
Do you think we could have
another go at it?

26:27.153 --> 26:28.484
Like on a trial basis.

26:28.588 --> 26:31.853
But, Andy, I'm married.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.653
That's okay.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.625
No one has to know.
It would be our secret.

26:35.729 --> 26:37.663
Just you and me, together.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.993
I have so many problems, Andy.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.028
My husband and I -

26:44.770 --> 26:47.330
I don't know what to do. He's -

26:47.439 --> 26:49.964
Oh, and I feel so betrayed.

26:50.074 --> 26:52.008
Sometimes, cheating can help a marriage.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.840
No. No, don't say that.
Cheating is wrong.

26:54.945 --> 26:57.675
Unfair. It's hurtful.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.114
One man for the rest of your life?
It's unnatural.

27:00.217 --> 27:02.583
Oh, but I'm trying to improve things.

27:05.555 --> 27:07.546
Tell me,Joy, please...

27:07.657 --> 27:11.093
after all that's passed,
knowing all you know now...

27:12.895 --> 27:15.693
do you wish you could've
been with me before?

27:19.634 --> 27:21.101
No.

27:26.241 --> 27:28.607
Eat shit, you fucking cunt.

27:28.709 --> 27:31.837
You think you're improving
other people's lives...

27:31.945 --> 27:34.379
saving them or freeing them -
from what?

27:34.480 --> 27:36.607
The fuck do you know
about other people?

27:36.716 --> 27:39.276
What? Idiot!

27:39.386 --> 27:41.377
Why did I kill myself?

27:41.487 --> 27:43.182
I should've killed you!

28:09.079 --> 28:12.048
- Mom!
- Yes, Timmy?

28:12.148 --> 28:14.616
Is Dad really dead?

28:14.717 --> 28:16.844
Why are you asking me this now?

28:16.952 --> 28:19.420
Avi Fleischer told me
he found him on the Internet...

28:19.521 --> 28:22.149
and that he was sent to jail
for raping young boys.

28:22.257 --> 28:25.226
And now everyone at school
is saying that my dad's alive...

28:25.327 --> 28:27.022
and that he's a pedophile.

28:27.128 --> 28:30.495
- Oh, Timmy. Shh, shh. It's okay.
- Then he said he was a faggot.

28:30.598 --> 28:33.863
- Oh, Timmy.
- And then he said that I was a faggot.

28:33.968 --> 28:36.596
- So I -
- Timmy, what did you do?

28:36.704 --> 28:40.401
I didn't do anything.
I just ran away-

28:40.507 --> 28:42.372
like a faggot.

28:42.476 --> 28:43.500
Oh, Timmy, listen to me.

28:43.609 --> 28:46.908
You are not a faggot, and your father-

28:47.012 --> 28:49.207
He's alive?

28:49.315 --> 28:51.180
And he's a -

28:51.283 --> 28:53.547
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

28:53.652 --> 28:57.019
I thought it would be better
for you to think that -

28:57.122 --> 28:59.352
to think that maybe he was in heaven.

28:59.457 --> 29:01.220
- But I could've helped him.
- No, honey.

29:01.325 --> 29:04.419
No one could help him.
He-He was beyond help.

29:04.529 --> 29:07.293
- Where is he now?
- Locked up, up north.

29:07.398 --> 29:09.093
It doesn't matter.

29:09.199 --> 29:11.565
- Does Billy know?
- Billy's older.

29:11.668 --> 29:14.535
Billy's in college.

29:14.637 --> 29:16.628
- I hate you.
- Timmy, please.

29:16.740 --> 29:17.968
Please forgive me.

29:18.074 --> 29:23.011
You-You have to understand
that I just wanted to protect you.

29:23.112 --> 29:27.742
I just - I wanted you to grow up
free and happy, as if he were dead.

29:31.820 --> 29:33.515
Fuck you, bitch.

29:44.331 --> 29:47.596
Mommy.

29:48.401 --> 29:51.802
Yes, honey. Are you ready for me
to take you to karaoke class?

29:51.905 --> 29:55.932
I ran out of my Klonopin.
Do you have any I can have first?

29:56.041 --> 29:58.202
Of course, honey.
Just go into my medicine cabinet.

29:58.310 --> 29:59.607
Okay.

30:00.612 --> 30:01.909
Okay.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.617
- Oh, God.
- I can't find it!

30:10.721 --> 30:13.281
Just take half a Wellbutrin.

30:13.391 --> 30:17.020
They're on the bottom right,
next to the Percocet.

30:17.127 --> 30:18.594
Okay!

30:20.664 --> 30:23.098
You know what?
Just bring over the whole bottle.

30:40.982 --> 30:42.449
Sweetheart.

30:50.022 --> 30:51.489
Timmy.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.793
I know how you must feel -

30:55.895 --> 30:58.557
like I felt when I found out -

30:58.664 --> 31:01.224
like you were lied to.

31:01.333 --> 31:03.893
And, yes, I did lie.

31:05.403 --> 31:09.066
But I lied to you because I love you...

31:09.174 --> 31:11.802
because I didn't want any harm
to come to you.

31:11.910 --> 31:14.970
But what if I become one though?

31:15.079 --> 31:17.047
I don't wanna be a faggot.

31:19.115 --> 31:24.246
There's this kid in my language arts class,
and he's so gay.

31:24.354 --> 31:26.549
You won't. You won't.

31:27.657 --> 31:29.352
I promise.

31:30.392 --> 31:32.758
I'm sorry I called you "bitch. "

31:32.861 --> 31:35.352
Oh.

31:35.465 --> 31:37.160
It's okay, honey.

31:40.435 --> 31:43.165
Sweet dreams.

32:04.657 --> 32:08.252
Mom.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.523
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yes.

32:11.629 --> 32:14.029
But I need to talk to you.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.764
Uh-huh? Go on.

32:21.005 --> 32:22.131
Well...

32:23.740 --> 32:29.235
what exactly does a man do to a boy
when he's... raping him?

32:30.480 --> 32:35.645
I mean, I know of course exactly
what you would do with a girl and all...

32:35.751 --> 32:40.085
but with a boy, where do things go?

32:40.188 --> 32:43.055
Oh, Timmy. Oh, Timmy, Timmy.

32:43.159 --> 32:44.888
Please tell me.

32:44.993 --> 32:47.894
Really. I need to know.

32:47.996 --> 32:51.261
- I'm almost a man.
- All right.

32:53.233 --> 32:58.330
Well, you know how things
are different between boys and girls?

32:58.439 --> 33:00.134
Yeah.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.869
Well, uh...

33:03.977 --> 33:07.913
they're the same between boys and boys.

33:08.013 --> 33:09.878
Uh-huh.

33:09.983 --> 33:13.043
So, well, it's like -

33:14.319 --> 33:20.053
When Harvey touched me
for the first time on the elbow -

33:20.157 --> 33:22.523
That's all it takes is a touch.

33:22.627 --> 33:24.322
Just a touch can be enough.

33:24.429 --> 33:28.024
You mean, if a man just touches me -

33:28.132 --> 33:31.795
No man should ever touch you.

33:31.901 --> 33:35.837
But what if he does? Or by accident.

33:35.939 --> 33:38.100
You scream.

33:46.115 --> 33:50.176
Avi Fleischer said
that pedophiles are terrorists...

33:50.284 --> 33:54.015
and that they stick their penises
into your... tushy.

33:54.122 --> 33:57.216
Avi Fleischer doesn't know
what he's talking about.

33:57.325 --> 33:59.020
There are other things.

33:59.126 --> 34:04.530
Your father may have been a pedophile,
but he was also a man and a father...

34:04.631 --> 34:06.963
- and some things -
- Oh, Mom.

34:07.067 --> 34:10.969
I don't want anything ever
to go inside of me, not ever.

34:11.070 --> 34:13.868
Oh, Timmy. Timmy, don't worry.

34:13.973 --> 34:17.431
Don't worry. Nothing -
Nothing will ever get inside you!

34:17.542 --> 34:19.703
Not so long as I'm around.

40:01.517 --> 40:03.212
Mind if I join you?

40:04.888 --> 40:06.355
Please.

40:10.626 --> 40:12.617
Forgive me. Please tell me you're straight.

40:14.129 --> 40:16.996
- I am.
- Oh, thank God.

40:21.003 --> 40:23.062
So what are you doing here all alone?

40:23.171 --> 40:24.638
Work.

40:25.606 --> 40:28.837
- You like your work?
- It pays.

40:28.943 --> 40:30.968
Good. Then we don't have
to talk about it.

40:33.881 --> 40:36.475
- Are you alone?
- Married.

40:37.450 --> 40:39.441
Alone. The same thing.

40:39.552 --> 40:42.385
No. Alone is alone.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.485
I'm good at reading people, you know.

40:48.227 --> 40:50.286
What do you read now?

40:50.396 --> 40:52.296
Well, I see a man...

40:54.198 --> 40:57.531
and he's alone, and he's straight.

40:57.635 --> 40:59.102
That's good enough for me.

41:01.439 --> 41:03.430
<i>You are good.</i>

41:04.541 --> 41:06.236
My husband was a fag.

41:09.146 --> 41:11.376
Must have been hard.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.846
Only man I ever loved.

41:15.218 --> 41:17.482
What happened to him?

41:17.586 --> 41:19.247
Stuff.

41:21.823 --> 41:24.291
- Any kids?
- Not anymore.

41:24.392 --> 41:27.020
Just a pack of wolves,
and they're out for blood.

41:27.128 --> 41:28.254
How so?

41:28.363 --> 41:30.263
They've decided I'm the villain.

41:31.399 --> 41:34.926
- I'm a monster.
- Why do they think that?

41:37.438 --> 41:39.406
'Cause I am a monster.

41:43.377 --> 41:47.871
People can't help it...
if they're monsters.

41:50.248 --> 41:52.944
They can't be forgiven either.

41:53.051 --> 41:54.541
Have you asked for forgiveness?

41:54.654 --> 41:56.451
I'm not a fool.

41:56.555 --> 41:59.285
If I were them,
I wouldn't forgive me either.

41:59.391 --> 42:03.122
In my family,
there are only winners and losers.

42:03.227 --> 42:06.560
And only losers ask for forgiveness.

42:08.065 --> 42:10.499
Only losers expect to get it.

42:15.371 --> 42:18.067
The world out there...

42:20.375 --> 42:22.070
it can be harsh.

42:22.178 --> 42:24.203
What the hell do you know
about the world out there...

42:24.313 --> 42:27.942
that I don't already know... twice over?

42:31.319 --> 42:33.082
The enemy's within.

42:41.461 --> 42:43.429
Your room have a view?

42:48.501 --> 42:49.627
No.

42:50.837 --> 42:52.304
Same here.

42:53.606 --> 42:55.699
Who the fuck needs one anyway?

42:57.276 --> 42:58.971
Why do you feel that way?

42:59.077 --> 43:00.874
What are you, a shrink?

43:27.636 --> 43:29.604
I need more than a caress.

44:24.054 --> 44:25.749
How much do you need?

44:25.854 --> 44:29.517
- What?
- It's okay.

44:29.626 --> 44:31.116
I understand.

44:32.228 --> 44:34.128
It was hard work.

44:35.331 --> 44:36.855
I'm old.

44:40.536 --> 44:43.528
There's a stash in the Chanel -
the zippered pocket. Take it all.

45:01.087 --> 45:02.782
What are you looking at?

45:04.490 --> 45:07.254
Don't start pretending like you care...

45:07.359 --> 45:09.554
like I'm not a monster...

45:09.662 --> 45:12.927
like I still have a heart that -

45:18.769 --> 45:20.430
Forgive me.

45:20.537 --> 45:22.232
Fuck off, prick.

45:32.181 --> 45:34.706
What do you want, honey?
Let me just make it simple for her.

45:34.816 --> 45:36.283
She's got some food issues.

45:36.386 --> 45:40.015
Let's just get a mesclun salad, no pepper.
Just very simple.

45:40.122 --> 45:42.750
And I'll have the Salade Nioise
with the dressing on the side.

45:42.858 --> 45:44.689
- Perfect. It'll be right out.
- Thank you.

45:44.793 --> 45:48.593
Joy, I am so happy to see you.

45:48.696 --> 45:51.426
- I'm so happy to see you too.
- And you know something?

45:51.532 --> 45:53.193
- What?
- You look good.

45:53.301 --> 45:54.996
- Really?
- I mean it.

45:55.102 --> 45:57.400
You put some meat on your bones.

45:57.504 --> 45:59.870
You used to look so peaked all the time.

45:59.973 --> 46:03.909
I thought, "Maybe she's got
some rare blood disease.

46:04.010 --> 46:06.444
But, Trish," I said, "Leave her alone.
She's old enough.

46:06.546 --> 46:11.040
If she wants to be vegetarian
to prove some point, then, you know" -

46:12.284 --> 46:15.481
But, golly. So you're back
to eating red meat?

46:15.586 --> 46:17.213
No.

46:17.323 --> 46:21.487
Wow, even so. God knows how,
but that tofu is workin', girl.

46:21.592 --> 46:22.786
Thanks.

46:22.894 --> 46:24.828
You look good too.

46:24.929 --> 46:27.727
- You know what my secret is?
- What?

46:27.831 --> 46:29.560
I met someone.

46:29.666 --> 46:31.691
Really? Oh, that's great.

46:31.802 --> 46:33.827
- And...
- And?

46:33.937 --> 46:35.495
we're getting married.

46:35.605 --> 46:37.197
- No!
- Yes!

46:37.306 --> 46:38.967
Oh!

46:39.075 --> 46:42.511
The kids haven't met him yet,
so provided they like him -

46:42.610 --> 46:43.702
Oh, Trish.

46:43.812 --> 46:46.144
Billy I'm not worried about,
but Timmy and Chloe...

46:46.248 --> 46:48.182
they're - they're still children.

46:48.283 --> 46:49.807
Oh, I know.

46:49.918 --> 46:52.682
It's a secret. No one knows -
not Helen, not even Mom.

46:52.787 --> 46:55.620
I promise. I won't tell a soul.

46:58.793 --> 47:03.127
But don't you think you're maybe...
rushing things a bit?

47:03.230 --> 47:06.859
I mean, men are -

47:10.203 --> 47:12.694
I don't know. And after Bill.

47:12.805 --> 47:15.205
- Bill was totally different.
- Still.

47:15.308 --> 47:18.300
No. No. The past is the past.

47:18.410 --> 47:20.708
Dead. Gone. Wipe my hands.
Forgotten.

47:20.812 --> 47:22.609
It's got nothing to do
with me and the kids.

47:22.713 --> 47:26.945
- We live in Florida now.
- I'm sorry. Just -Just -

47:28.819 --> 47:32.880
Now, Harvey, on the other hand,
well, he's not very attractive.

47:32.990 --> 47:36.050
He's older.
He's not even that well off.

47:36.159 --> 47:37.683
He's divorced.

47:37.794 --> 47:40.228
Poor thing had a horrible, horrible wife.

47:40.330 --> 47:42.890
But he's Jewish. He's pro-Israel.

47:42.999 --> 47:47.060
He did work for Bush and McCain,
but only because of Israel.

47:47.169 --> 47:50.730
He knows these people are complete idiots
otherwise, so don't worry.

47:50.839 --> 47:54.866
Basically, he's just a plain,
totally family-oriented kind of guy.

47:54.977 --> 47:57.741
- He's a real mensch.
- Oh.

47:57.845 --> 48:01.281
Joy, I need this to work.

48:03.450 --> 48:04.974
Have-Have you -

48:06.586 --> 48:07.712
And was it -

48:07.822 --> 48:10.052
So normal!

48:10.157 --> 48:14.491
- Oh, Trish, I'm so happy for you.
- Me too. Me too.

48:14.593 --> 48:18.120
But you -What about you?
You haven't told me a thing.

48:18.230 --> 48:20.755
Oh. I'm fine. I'm -

48:23.068 --> 48:25.866
- How's Allen?
- Oh, fine. Fine.

48:25.970 --> 48:29.269
Just don't listen to Mom. Really.

48:29.374 --> 48:32.434
Everything's the same - fine.

48:32.543 --> 48:36.274
I just needed to get away for a bit.
A little me time.

48:37.248 --> 48:40.046
What about your work with the ex-cons?
How's that going?

48:40.150 --> 48:43.847
Oh, fine, fine. I miss them already.

48:43.953 --> 48:45.580
But, my God.

48:45.688 --> 48:50.284
Working with those criminals
and-and... rapists. I -

48:51.761 --> 48:54.525
I don't know,Joy. Don't you ever
think about working with -

48:54.629 --> 48:57.894
with the victims - good people?

48:57.999 --> 49:00.797
Not all criminals and rapists
are bad, Trish.

49:00.901 --> 49:04.393
I don't know what your dictionary says,
but it's pretty clear in mine.

49:04.506 --> 49:06.269
But I'm sorry. I don't mean to criticize.

49:06.373 --> 49:08.432
It's your profession,
and I totally respect that.

49:08.542 --> 49:11.534
It's just - I could never do it.

49:12.745 --> 49:14.372
You're a saint. Really.

49:14.481 --> 49:16.472
Really, it's just a job.

49:16.584 --> 49:17.881
All right now. Salade Nioise.

49:17.984 --> 49:20.817
Oh, I'm sorry. I asked
for the dressing on the side.

49:20.920 --> 49:22.581
Oh, I'm sorry.
We'll take care of that right away.

49:22.689 --> 49:24.156
I'm sorry.

49:28.827 --> 49:33.491
You know,Joy,
there's something I never told you.

49:34.233 --> 49:38.135
I guess being the older sister,
sibling rivalry and all -

49:38.236 --> 49:39.999
But now that we're
so much more bonded -

49:42.005 --> 49:45.532
I always believed deep down -

49:45.643 --> 49:47.508
and so did Mom and Dad and Helen...

49:47.611 --> 49:50.739
'cause we discussed it all
so many times, but -

49:51.948 --> 49:54.781
When you married Allen...

49:54.884 --> 49:57.375
w- we thought you were so...

49:58.854 --> 49:59.843
brave.

49:59.955 --> 50:02.515
But... why?

50:02.625 --> 50:06.857
I may as well confess.
I know everything. We all have.

50:07.929 --> 50:11.660
Allen's... problem, his -

50:13.935 --> 50:16.096
And how you tried so hard
to cure him...

50:16.203 --> 50:17.830
so he could be normal.

50:17.938 --> 50:21.430
And how you eventually thought
he was cured - as if.

50:21.541 --> 50:23.839
Joy, there are no secrets in the family.

50:23.943 --> 50:27.276
You of all people, you must know that by now.
You've always been an open book.

50:29.048 --> 50:30.948
But you seemed so desperately happy...

50:31.050 --> 50:34.508
and we all so desperately
wanted you to be happy.

50:34.619 --> 50:37.247
And it seemed like if it wasn't Allen, then -

50:39.724 --> 50:40.850
I'm sorry.

50:42.527 --> 50:46.327
I'm so sorry, but it's important
that we be open with each other.

50:47.197 --> 50:51.395
Joy, you're a beautiful woman,
even if you're past your-

50:52.870 --> 50:56.203
And I really think,
from the bottom of my heart...

50:56.306 --> 50:58.206
that you should just drop him.

50:58.308 --> 51:01.641
Drop your job, drop everything
and move to Florida.

51:01.743 --> 51:04.177
Down here, it's easy to forget everything...

51:04.279 --> 51:07.976
start over, fresh - like me -
as if you were still young.

51:08.083 --> 51:11.644
I mean, what are you really gonna miss?
What matters more than family?

51:11.753 --> 51:14.221
Friends come and go.
Ajob is just a job.

51:14.322 --> 51:18.224
Shopping, food, HBO -
everything here, same as anywhere else.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.987
Joy, don't take this the wrong way.
I just -

51:23.297 --> 51:25.959
I love you so much.

51:26.766 --> 51:28.233
I love you.

51:39.011 --> 51:41.309
Joy!

51:51.522 --> 51:52.853
God.

51:52.956 --> 51:57.984
I can't tell you how happy I am to see you,
how happy I am you found me.

51:58.095 --> 52:01.121
- Oh, me too.
- I've been feeling so guilty.

52:01.230 --> 52:04.256
Oh, but really, Helen,
you didn't do anything wrong.

52:04.367 --> 52:06.767
I know, but still.

52:06.869 --> 52:08.359
- Everyone understands.
- I know.

52:09.771 --> 52:11.432
And I forgive them...

52:11.539 --> 52:13.700
but even so -

52:15.010 --> 52:19.811
Cutting ties with Mom, Dad,
Trish especially-

52:19.914 --> 52:21.541
it must have been hard.

52:21.649 --> 52:23.116
It was.

52:23.217 --> 52:25.845
Really, I can't tell you.

52:26.553 --> 52:28.453
I missed you, but -

52:28.554 --> 52:31.648
It's all right. I understand.

52:32.892 --> 52:34.621
And I forgive you.

52:36.396 --> 52:39.627
I just felt bad -
I mean, when I couldn't reach you...

52:39.731 --> 52:42.063
'cause you were unlisted.

52:42.167 --> 52:44.135
I had no choice.

52:45.871 --> 52:50.570
I can't tell you,Joy, how many times
I thought about calling you.

52:50.675 --> 52:51.733
Really?

52:52.743 --> 52:54.802
I was too guilt-ridden.

52:54.912 --> 52:59.315
Oh, Helen. All this time, we all thought
you were just ashamed of us -

52:59.417 --> 53:03.478
of being related to us, like it would
ruin your career or something.

53:03.586 --> 53:05.315
Ashamed?

53:05.422 --> 53:06.719
How could you -

53:06.823 --> 53:10.190
I'm sorry. I should have had more faith.
We all should have been more understanding.

53:10.292 --> 53:12.692
I was going through a very intense time.

53:12.796 --> 53:15.663
I'd given up on poetry.

53:15.764 --> 53:18.164
It had become too -

53:18.267 --> 53:20.326
too easy.

53:20.435 --> 53:25.338
And I was feeling crushed
by the enormity of my success.

53:25.440 --> 53:27.738
And I was afraid.

53:29.110 --> 53:30.737
But you know something?

53:31.945 --> 53:37.076
It turns out writing a good screenplay
is a much harder...

53:38.418 --> 53:43.117
and purer process.

53:43.222 --> 53:46.385
Still, it must at least be neat
going out with Keanu.

53:46.492 --> 53:49.086
There's nothing neat about it.

53:49.894 --> 53:51.794
I'm sorry.
That was a stupid thing to say.

53:51.897 --> 53:54.695
- It's fucking idiotic.
- You're right.

53:54.799 --> 53:58.758
I mean, like, we're still a country at war!

54:06.643 --> 54:09.305
<i>Oh, God.</i>

54:11.714 --> 54:13.682
Salman again.

54:15.084 --> 54:17.678
He wants to know
what he should wear to the Emmys.

54:17.786 --> 54:19.219
Kwaku?

54:23.291 --> 54:26.692
So, how long do you plan
on staying out here?

54:26.795 --> 54:28.262
Oh, I don't know.

54:28.362 --> 54:32.059
I thought maybe if I could stay with you
just till I got my life together.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.059
- How much time are we talking?
- I don't know.

54:35.169 --> 54:38.730
I'm sure I could find a job within
a couple of months - or weeks.

54:38.839 --> 54:41.307
Days if I really set my mind to it.

54:41.407 --> 54:42.897
And what are you gonna do out here?

54:43.009 --> 54:44.567
Try working with ex-cons again.

54:44.677 --> 54:47.510
I've had a lot of success
with penitentiaries back east.

54:47.614 --> 54:50.082
And California, well -

54:50.183 --> 54:53.380
There are so many prisons here,
so I thought that I could maybe -

54:53.485 --> 54:58.081
- And if that doesn't work out?
- Oh, anything. Really, anything's fine.

54:58.189 --> 54:59.156
Anything?

54:59.257 --> 55:00.815
Yeah, anything.

55:02.426 --> 55:04.291
Say, do you know Joni Mitchell?

55:04.395 --> 55:05.862
I heard she lives out here...

55:05.963 --> 55:07.931
and she's someone I've always thought
I'd really connect with...

55:08.031 --> 55:09.726
like she'd really get me, you know?

55:09.833 --> 55:11.994
Maybe she could give me some advice.

55:12.102 --> 55:13.569
Can I give you some advice?

55:13.669 --> 55:14.761
Oh, please.

55:16.673 --> 55:19.141
No. Actually, I have no advice for you.

55:33.955 --> 55:36.253
Did I say something wrong?

55:36.357 --> 55:38.291
No. Why?

55:38.992 --> 55:41.790
Then why do you still
have to make fun of me?

55:43.330 --> 55:44.797
Make fun?

55:44.898 --> 55:46.126
Yes.

55:46.233 --> 55:48.133
I'm not -

55:48.868 --> 55:52.065
Oh, God. Please,Joy.

55:52.171 --> 55:54.662
I try. I really do.

55:54.773 --> 55:59.005
But you and Keanu and everyone...

55:59.111 --> 56:01.102
thinks I mock them...

56:01.213 --> 56:04.808
that I'm cruel and condescending,
that I have no heart.

56:04.916 --> 56:08.079
And it's really hard.

56:08.185 --> 56:12.485
It's hard on me,
because I really do love you.

56:12.590 --> 56:13.989
I do.

56:14.091 --> 56:17.925
And I know how you didn't come
all this way and hunt me down for nothing.

56:18.027 --> 56:23.260
You really just want my advice
on men and marriage and Allen...

56:23.365 --> 56:24.832
and why nothing works out...

56:24.934 --> 56:26.697
and you feel like a total loser-

56:26.803 --> 56:28.998
the self-disgust, self-loathing.

56:29.104 --> 56:33.165
Life has no point, it's over,
you're basically dead...

56:33.275 --> 56:37.041
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
and you think maybe I have the answer.

56:37.144 --> 56:40.910
But,Joy, I'm only human.

56:42.550 --> 56:44.017
I'm sorry.

56:44.118 --> 56:46.746
It's my fault. I shouldn't have.

56:46.853 --> 56:48.684
No. It's okay.

56:50.490 --> 56:52.685
I'm used to that. I can take it.

56:53.627 --> 56:55.288
But thanks.

56:55.629 --> 56:58.530
<i># I try to forgive #</i>

57:38.199 --> 57:40.224
Oh, Andy.

57:40.335 --> 57:42.030
I'm sorry about before.

57:42.970 --> 57:45.461
It's just I'm off my medication and -

57:47.108 --> 57:49.440
Really, I didn't mean what I said.

57:51.045 --> 57:53.070
What are you doing here?

57:54.180 --> 57:55.738
I don't know.

57:55.848 --> 58:01.252
I saw you all alone, and I thought -

58:03.189 --> 58:04.281
What?

58:06.525 --> 58:08.493
Was your song about me?

58:09.361 --> 58:10.988
No.

58:18.469 --> 58:19.436
You know...

58:20.471 --> 58:23.440
just listening to Helen and Keanu, I -

58:23.540 --> 58:25.007
I can't help but thinking -

58:26.710 --> 58:27.802
What?

58:28.479 --> 58:32.313
What about you and I spend the night
together,just like old times?

58:33.216 --> 58:35.946
But we never spent the night
together before.

58:37.353 --> 58:39.446
Old times?

58:39.555 --> 58:41.955
We never did anything.

58:42.057 --> 58:44.116
I wouldn't let anything happen.

58:45.761 --> 58:48.286
Wouldn't you like to change things?

58:48.396 --> 58:50.057
Change the past?

58:51.232 --> 58:53.166
Fix everything like it could have been?

58:54.001 --> 58:55.866
Done the right thing?

58:55.970 --> 58:58.200
Oh, Andy.

58:58.305 --> 59:00.603
Sometimes -

59:00.707 --> 59:03.801
Sometimes it's better to just...

59:03.909 --> 59:06.503
let go.

59:15.086 --> 59:17.111
Do you think Helen's happy?

59:17.756 --> 59:19.246
Yes.

59:20.091 --> 59:21.888
I think she's faking it.

59:23.495 --> 59:26.396
Sometimes just pretending
can be better than the real thing.

59:26.964 --> 59:29.558
Oh, but I hate pretending.

59:30.334 --> 59:32.632
Everyone pretending.

59:41.210 --> 59:43.007
I'm not pretending.

59:45.614 --> 59:50.642
Imagine a world where no one pretended.

01:00:18.944 --> 01:00:20.809
Please forgive me.

01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:24.371
I tried, but I just can't fake it.

01:00:32.023 --> 01:00:33.490
Come on,Joy.

01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:35.218
- Come on. Joy!
- No. No.

01:00:35.325 --> 01:00:39.125
- Come on,Joy. Joy. Joy.
- No. No.

01:00:42.998 --> 01:00:45.330
Back off, motherfucker!

01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:11.251
<i>- Hi. this is Joy.
- And this is Allen.</i>

01:01:11.357 --> 01:01:14.758
<i>Please leave a message
at the sound of the-</i>

01:01:16.696 --> 01:01:18.163
<i>Allen?</i>

01:01:19.866 --> 01:01:22.926
<i>I just wanted to tell you
that I'm coming home.</i>

01:01:23.668 --> 01:01:26.762
<i>I- I miss you.</i>

01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:31.308
<i>I'm sorry.
but relationships are so complicated.</i>

01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:35.637
<i>Sometimes I ask myself.
what am I doing?</i>

01:01:35.746 --> 01:01:37.543
<i>Why are we fighting?</i>

01:01:37.648 --> 01:01:39.445
<i>Why does anyone fight?</i>

01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:41.312
<i>What good does it do?</i>

01:01:41.986 --> 01:01:46.150
<i>Your problem - well. it just seems
so unimportant now.</i>

01:01:46.256 --> 01:01:49.953
<i>It's probably psychological or genetic.
I really don't care.</i>

01:01:50.492 --> 01:01:53.120
<i>I forgive you.
if forgiveness even mattered.</i>

01:01:53.228 --> 01:01:59.167
<i>Really. all I want is just to be with you
and my ex-cons and security guard friends...</i>

01:01:59.268 --> 01:02:02.294
<i>maybe have a heart-to-heart
with that poor waitress.</i>

01:02:03.671 --> 01:02:07.129
<i>Oh. Allen. I just hope you haven't been
too depressed or anything.</i>

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.902
<i>But don't worry. I'm on my way.</i>

01:02:10.011 --> 01:02:11.774
<i>And I love you.</i>

01:02:33.431 --> 01:02:35.922
Oh! Yeah!

01:02:39.037 --> 01:02:40.766
Fuck family.

01:02:41.939 --> 01:02:43.736
Fuck motherhood.

01:02:44.875 --> 01:02:46.433
Fuck the kids.

01:02:48.077 --> 01:02:50.102
I just don't care anymore.

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:02.181
What I said before -
about the kids and family-

01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:03.917
I didn't really mean it.

01:03:06.795 --> 01:03:08.262
I know.

01:03:13.968 --> 01:03:16.163
Love really can change a person.

01:03:38.423 --> 01:03:40.186
Don't ever leave me.

01:03:41.659 --> 01:03:43.388
I won't survive it.

01:03:43.494 --> 01:03:45.121
Promise me.

01:03:52.168 --> 01:03:54.398
<i>- Mommy?
- Yes, Honey?</i>

01:03:54.504 --> 01:03:57.439
Do you think baby carrots feel pain?

01:04:00.143 --> 01:04:01.610
Timmy, could you get the door?

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:03.007
Sure, Mom.

01:04:04.179 --> 01:04:06.807
Hi. Hi. Harvey Wiener.

01:04:06.915 --> 01:04:08.906
Nice to meet you.
You must be Timmy.

01:04:09.017 --> 01:04:11.144
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. That's my son, Mark.

01:04:11.252 --> 01:04:15.586
Hi! Oh! Look at those tulips.
Those are beautiful.

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:17.248
Red for love.

01:04:17.358 --> 01:04:19.121
What about the white?

01:04:19.226 --> 01:04:21.091
Uh -

01:04:21.194 --> 01:04:22.923
- Timmy!
- Uh, for forgiveness.

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:25.157
- I'm sorry if we're a little early.
- Oh, please. Come on in.

01:04:25.264 --> 01:04:27.926
- Mark, hi. I'm Trish. It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, my God, who's that?

01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:30.435
Timmy, get the door, sweetheart.
This is Chloe. Say hi.

01:04:30.536 --> 01:04:32.936
- Oh, hi, Chloe.
- Come on, sweetheart. Say hi.

01:04:33.039 --> 01:04:34.199
Hi. How are you?

01:04:34.307 --> 01:04:35.934
Mmm!

01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:40.102
Mmm! This chicken - out of this world.

01:04:40.211 --> 01:04:41.974
Really? It's not too dry?

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.071
Oh, like butter. Mmm!

01:04:44.182 --> 01:04:45.672
Oh, and the sauce.

01:04:45.784 --> 01:04:48.275
- It's Israeli style.
- Ah.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:52.822
Mommy, the baby carrots -
they're looking so sad.

01:04:52.923 --> 01:04:55.517
Aw. Shoot 'em on over.
I'll cheer 'em up.

01:04:56.794 --> 01:04:59.456
- Thank you.
- Chloe is studying karaoke after school.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:03.328
- Her teacher thinks she has a lot of potential.
- Oh, I'll bet.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:05.628
Would you like to sing
for Harvey after dinner, Chloe?

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:19.002
Sorry. It's the Klonopin.
She's on a new dosage.

01:05:19.113 --> 01:05:22.310
Mm-hmm. I see. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:26.780
So, Mark, what do you do?

01:05:26.887 --> 01:05:28.184
Systems analysis.

01:05:28.288 --> 01:05:30.051
That sounds interesting.

01:05:30.156 --> 01:05:33.387
It is to me - moderately.
Like intermediate-level Sudoku.

01:05:34.159 --> 01:05:37.651
But I have no illusions that what I do
is of any interest to anyone else...

01:05:37.764 --> 01:05:39.891
even amongst specialists.

01:05:39.998 --> 01:05:43.195
I'm something of a functionary,
but without ambition...

01:05:43.302 --> 01:05:45.327
or even hope of ambition.

01:05:45.436 --> 01:05:47.666
I plateaued in grad school,
then lost interest...

01:05:47.772 --> 01:05:52.072
except in maintaining a base salary adequate
to financing a low-overhead subsistence.

01:05:54.445 --> 01:05:56.242
Are you seeing anyone?

01:05:56.347 --> 01:05:58.440
No, I'm more focused on China.

01:05:58.548 --> 01:06:00.038
Everything else is history.

01:06:00.817 --> 01:06:02.478
It's just a question of time.

01:06:28.409 --> 01:06:29.876
Talk to him.

01:06:36.417 --> 01:06:38.442
So, Timmy...

01:06:38.551 --> 01:06:40.849
your mom tells me you're gonna
be bar mitzvahed soon.

01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:42.887
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

01:06:42.988 --> 01:06:45.388
I remember my bar mitzvah.

01:06:45.491 --> 01:06:47.356
You remember yours, Mark?

01:06:51.163 --> 01:06:54.155
Timmy's preparing a special speech -
a D'var Torah. Isn't that right?

01:06:54.265 --> 01:06:55.994
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.567
Mmm. What's the topic?

01:06:57.668 --> 01:06:59.329
It's on becoming a man.

01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:00.928
Oh. Interesting.

01:07:01.038 --> 01:07:05.065
Actually, it's mainly about the story
ofJoseph and forgiveness.

01:07:05.176 --> 01:07:09.078
Like when you're supposed to forgive
someone, even if you don't want to...

01:07:09.179 --> 01:07:12.342
and how that makes you a man -
things like that.

01:07:12.449 --> 01:07:14.144
Like "forgive and forget"?

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:16.650
Well, like for example...

01:07:16.752 --> 01:07:19.243
say I...

01:07:19.354 --> 01:07:21.083
punched you in the face.

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:24.057
If I said I was sorry,
would you forgive me?

01:07:24.158 --> 01:07:26.854
Well, of course he would,
but why would you do such a thing?

01:07:26.962 --> 01:07:29.863
- That's not the point, Mom.
- No. I understand.

01:07:29.964 --> 01:07:32.990
Yes, I would forgive you.

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.831
I think, uh, I would ask for an explanation.

01:07:36.937 --> 01:07:39.132
So that you believe I'm really sorry?

01:07:39.239 --> 01:07:40.934
Well -

01:07:41.041 --> 01:07:46.138
Look, um, like I told you,
I'm sure I would forgive you, but...

01:07:46.245 --> 01:07:49.442
well, I'm not sure that I would forget.

01:07:51.216 --> 01:07:56.051
But let's say, for example, a terrorist
blows up your office building.

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.851
- Do you still forgive?
- God forbid.

01:07:58.957 --> 01:08:01.050
But what if that terrorist
had a good reason?

01:08:01.159 --> 01:08:03.821
Terrorists, by definition,
do not have good reasons.

01:08:03.927 --> 01:08:06.521
But what if your family
were killed and tortured?

01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:10.259
Wouldn't you want to do something
about it, to protect others?

01:08:10.367 --> 01:08:13.564
Timmy, these terrorists are evil.

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:15.137
And cowards.

01:08:15.238 --> 01:08:16.761
They're not like you and me.

01:08:16.872 --> 01:08:19.706
They don't believe
in freedom and democracy.

01:08:19.809 --> 01:08:21.299
Your mother's right.

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:26.346
Timmy, are you saying
you would forgive the 9/11 terrorists?

01:08:26.448 --> 01:08:29.474
<i>Well, of course you can't
forgive those terrorists.</i>

01:08:29.584 --> 01:08:31.051
They're dead.

01:08:34.087 --> 01:08:37.580
If it's possible to forgive and forget...

01:08:37.691 --> 01:08:39.658
or to forgive and not forget...

01:08:41.127 --> 01:08:43.995
when would you forget
but not forgive?

01:08:49.602 --> 01:08:53.197
I think it's possible
someone does something...

01:08:53.305 --> 01:08:55.103
really terrible to you -

01:08:56.542 --> 01:08:58.533
like, really horrible -

01:08:59.745 --> 01:09:04.648
something that hurts you so bad,
and it's so painful.

01:09:07.618 --> 01:09:11.179
Maybe then it's better to forget...

01:09:11.288 --> 01:09:13.553
and live without all that pain...

01:09:13.657 --> 01:09:16.091
instead of forgiving and remembering.

01:10:00.666 --> 01:10:02.133
Gumdrops?

01:10:12.844 --> 01:10:15.404
See, like, my dad
had this drinking problem...

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:16.979
which is, like, totally genetic.

01:10:17.081 --> 01:10:20.573
His father died at, like, 43 or something
from alcohol poisoning.

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:23.311
So, anyway, anytime something
would go wrong at work...

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:27.150
he'd go out, get plastered,
come home, punch out my mom...

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:28.917
like it was all her fault.

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:30.822
- Are they still married?
- Mmm.

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:32.394
Yeah. Still in love.

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:33.927
- Oh, my God.
- Even though he -

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:34.996
Yes.

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.827
Whoa. That's, like, totally fucked.

01:10:37.932 --> 01:10:39.160
- Yeah.
- I know.

01:10:39.267 --> 01:10:40.234
Man.

01:10:40.335 --> 01:10:42.098
Okay, Billy. It's your turn.

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:44.536
- Oh, I don't know.
- Come on.

01:10:44.639 --> 01:10:46.106
Yeah, everyone else has.

01:10:46.207 --> 01:10:49.438
Who comes from the most fucked-up family?

01:10:49.542 --> 01:10:51.271
Whose parents are the most fucked up?

01:10:51.378 --> 01:10:52.845
Really, I can't compete.

01:10:52.947 --> 01:10:56.781
Billy, you're so weird. Don't tell me
you don't come from a fucked-up family.

01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:58.847
Really.

01:11:00.153 --> 01:11:02.883
My father died. That's about it.

01:11:02.988 --> 01:11:05.013
Was it suicide?

01:11:05.124 --> 01:11:06.113
No.

01:11:06.225 --> 01:11:07.852
Then how did he die?

01:11:09.862 --> 01:11:10.829
I forget.

01:11:10.929 --> 01:11:12.396
- Right.
- So lame.

01:11:12.497 --> 01:11:14.897
All right then. Looks like I win.

01:11:14.999 --> 01:11:16.626
Yeah. Best vaginalogue.

01:11:16.734 --> 01:11:18.725
No, but really, her family
is the most fucked up.

01:11:18.835 --> 01:11:21.360
Yeah, but it's only because
she was a foster child.

01:11:21.472 --> 01:11:23.633
- Otherwise, I'd so win.
- Uh, I don't think so.

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:26.140
Uh, you weren't molested by your step-dad.

01:11:26.243 --> 01:11:31.146
Oh, boo-hoo. Sorry, Sarah,
but child molestation has been, like, so done.

01:11:31.247 --> 01:11:33.772
And he only used his fingers anyway.
Get over it.

01:11:38.154 --> 01:11:40.486
- Billy, where you going?
- Yeah, don't leave.

01:11:40.589 --> 01:11:42.318
- Hey, come on, Billy.
- Please stay.

01:11:42.424 --> 01:11:45.860
- Come on, we're just kidding around. Billy!
- Come on!

01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:09.693
Billy.

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:16.407
Co - Come inside.

01:13:43.633 --> 01:13:45.897
I needed to see you.

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:50.065
How'd you find me?

01:13:50.172 --> 01:13:51.571
Stopped by your mom's.

01:13:52.974 --> 01:13:54.908
She was out.
The house was empty.

01:14:00.214 --> 01:14:01.772
Do you want some water?

01:14:03.184 --> 01:14:04.378
Thanks.

01:14:42.219 --> 01:14:43.413
One more?

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.046
Yeah.

01:15:11.778 --> 01:15:14.008
Thanks. I needed that.

01:15:23.623 --> 01:15:25.591
So how's school?

01:15:26.458 --> 01:15:27.482
Okay.

01:15:28.928 --> 01:15:30.395
What's your major?

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:33.529
Anthropology.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.900
You planning on grad school?

01:15:37.835 --> 01:15:38.859
Probably.

01:15:38.969 --> 01:15:41.062
- Get into research?
- Yeah.

01:15:42.405 --> 01:15:43.531
Maybe.

01:15:44.975 --> 01:15:48.672
I'm doing a paper on homosexuality
in the animal kingdom.

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:52.738
I've done a lot of reading
on the bonobo monkey.

01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:56.148
They share, like, 98%?
of the human genetic profile.

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:59.584
But they substitute sex for aggression...

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:02.054
and regularly engage in incest -

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:04.856
father/daughter, father/son...

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:07.157
mother/son.

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.262
It's a very peaceable lifestyle.

01:16:14.468 --> 01:16:15.765
Are you gay?

01:16:16.569 --> 01:16:17.536
No.

01:16:18.838 --> 01:16:20.169
Sure?

01:16:21.241 --> 01:16:22.401
Yeah.

01:16:24.144 --> 01:16:25.611
So you like women?

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:29.877
Yeah.

01:16:31.016 --> 01:16:34.008
I mean, really like women?

01:16:34.118 --> 01:16:36.086
Yes.

01:16:37.355 --> 01:16:41.416
Do you fantasize stripping them,
fucking them...

01:16:41.526 --> 01:16:42.993
raping them?

01:16:43.094 --> 01:16:44.925
Well, not -

01:16:45.028 --> 01:16:47.895
Not rape. Not really.

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.463
No rape fantasies?

01:16:53.337 --> 01:16:54.304
No.

01:16:56.039 --> 01:16:58.974
No, I - I don't think so.

01:17:08.183 --> 01:17:10.208
Got any more gumdrops?

01:17:13.521 --> 01:17:14.988
Uh -

01:17:35.241 --> 01:17:37.402
Why didn't you ever write?

01:17:39.578 --> 01:17:41.773
We didn't think it would be a good idea.

01:17:42.546 --> 01:17:44.980
- Your mother and I -
- She told everybody you were dead.

01:17:45.082 --> 01:17:46.982
Well, she was right.

01:17:49.086 --> 01:17:50.644
I went along.

01:17:51.922 --> 01:17:53.116
Good.

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:55.487
That's good.

01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:01.424
It's good you didn't write.

01:18:03.433 --> 01:18:04.991
It's good you were dead.

01:18:09.204 --> 01:18:11.195
I tried to forget.

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:16.569
And then I tried to remember.

01:18:18.279 --> 01:18:19.803
And I couldn't.

01:18:27.287 --> 01:18:28.686
Me too.

01:18:32.192 --> 01:18:33.489
Forgive me.

01:18:33.593 --> 01:18:35.788
There's nothing to forgive.

01:18:38.564 --> 01:18:40.293
I mean, it -

01:18:40.398 --> 01:18:42.958
It's all unforgivable.

01:18:43.836 --> 01:18:45.770
I have no sympathy for you.

01:18:51.909 --> 01:18:54.036
They did a lot of work on me.

01:18:54.144 --> 01:18:55.577
"Work"?

01:18:56.614 --> 01:18:58.343
Rehabilitation.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:01.717
And?

01:19:02.486 --> 01:19:04.283
I take medication.

01:19:07.723 --> 01:19:09.418
And-And that works?

01:19:09.524 --> 01:19:11.185
Nothing works.

01:19:11.861 --> 01:19:14.921
It just goes on... forever.

01:19:18.967 --> 01:19:21.299
I just had to come and see
that you wouldn't...

01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:24.870
become me.

01:19:27.775 --> 01:19:29.675
Cases - people like me.

01:19:31.845 --> 01:19:35.212
Genetically speaking, I'm lucky.

01:19:35.315 --> 01:19:36.612
I mean, we're lucky.

01:19:37.684 --> 01:19:39.879
It's a recessive thing.

01:19:44.022 --> 01:19:46.149
I tried to stay the course.

01:19:47.359 --> 01:19:49.020
Three kids.

01:19:49.127 --> 01:19:50.560
You should have cut and run.

01:19:52.598 --> 01:19:54.828
But, you know, when you were born...

01:19:56.367 --> 01:19:58.267
and I held you -

01:20:00.071 --> 01:20:01.698
So tiny.

01:20:05.877 --> 01:20:09.540
The future seemed so... possible.

01:20:14.016 --> 01:20:15.483
No, please don't go.

01:20:17.019 --> 01:20:18.987
Just keep pretending...

01:20:19.088 --> 01:20:21.056
like before.

01:20:21.157 --> 01:20:24.217
If you pretend enough -

01:20:26.995 --> 01:20:28.895
Thanks for the gumdrops.

01:20:51.551 --> 01:20:56.215
<i># He shall feed his flock #</i>

01:20:56.321 --> 01:21:01.486
<i># Like a shepherd #</i>

01:21:02.194 --> 01:21:07.632
<i># And he shall gather #</i>

01:21:07.731 --> 01:21:12.862
<i># The lambs with his arm #</i>

01:21:13.403 --> 01:21:18.238
<i># With his arm #</i>

01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:29.178
<i># And carry them #</i>

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:34.153
<i># In his bosom #</i>

01:21:34.255 --> 01:21:39.488
<i># And gently lead those #</i>

01:21:39.593 --> 01:21:43.893
<i># That are with young #</i>

01:21:47.567 --> 01:21:50.468
- The computer died.
- Tech support.

01:21:50.569 --> 01:21:53.060
Oh, and that was so beautiful.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.500
Although next time maybe you could learn
something a little more -

01:21:57.610 --> 01:21:58.577
Jewish?

01:21:58.677 --> 01:22:01.145
Don't you listen to him.
Mr. Sarcastic.

01:22:01.246 --> 01:22:03.714
Mom, could I please have
a moment alone with Harvey...

01:22:03.815 --> 01:22:05.806
while Mark is fixing the computer?

01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:09.778
Well, yeah, sure.

01:22:09.887 --> 01:22:11.354
Please follow me.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.361
Please sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

01:22:25.468 --> 01:22:26.935
Thank you, Timmy.

01:22:28.671 --> 01:22:30.935
Hmm. Nice place.

01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:38.510
My mom says
you're planning to marry her.

01:22:40.181 --> 01:22:42.081
Well, one step at a time.

01:22:42.182 --> 01:22:44.047
We'll see how things go.

01:22:45.152 --> 01:22:47.746
You mean my mom is wrong?

01:22:47.854 --> 01:22:49.845
You're not planning to marry her?

01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:52.790
Timmy...

01:22:54.694 --> 01:22:58.221
I love your mother very much.

01:22:58.330 --> 01:23:00.525
- So are you getting married?
- I hope so.

01:23:00.632 --> 01:23:03.226
We both hope so.
A lot of that depends on you.

01:23:04.569 --> 01:23:08.733
You know, while my brother is away at college,
I've been the man of the house.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.638
Oh, I know that. Your mother's told me.

01:23:11.742 --> 01:23:14.108
She's very proud of you.

01:23:14.211 --> 01:23:18.545
If something doesn't meet my approval,
it's up to me to decide what to do.

01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:20.412
Ooh.

01:23:20.518 --> 01:23:22.611
That's a lot of responsibility.

01:23:22.719 --> 01:23:24.846
You know, I'm almost 13.

01:23:24.954 --> 01:23:27.616
You don't have to talk to me
like I'm still a child.

01:23:30.859 --> 01:23:32.156
I'm sorry.

01:23:38.067 --> 01:23:40.001
I have some questions for you.

01:23:40.902 --> 01:23:43.871
If you lie, I'll find out...

01:23:44.738 --> 01:23:46.763
and I won't let you
go through with the marriage.

01:23:47.675 --> 01:23:49.643
I won't lie to you, Timmy.

01:23:49.744 --> 01:23:51.268
I'm an open and honest person.

01:23:52.179 --> 01:23:54.579
Have you ever had sex with a man or boy?

01:23:55.915 --> 01:23:56.882
No.

01:23:56.982 --> 01:23:58.745
- Not a single time?
- No.

01:23:58.851 --> 01:24:00.614
Not even in your dreams?

01:24:00.721 --> 01:24:01.881
No.

01:24:03.155 --> 01:24:04.179
Okay.

01:24:05.057 --> 01:24:07.082
Do you think a pedophile
is a terrorist?

01:24:07.192 --> 01:24:08.716
What -What?

01:24:08.827 --> 01:24:10.294
Um, well, I mean -

01:24:10.395 --> 01:24:12.659
If you ever met a pedophile,
what would you do?

01:24:14.599 --> 01:24:16.658
Timmy, I would never-

01:24:16.768 --> 01:24:18.861
Y- You're touching me.

01:24:18.969 --> 01:24:20.561
Timmy...

01:24:20.671 --> 01:24:22.332
I know where you're coming from.

01:24:22.439 --> 01:24:24.168
And I want you to know -

01:24:24.273 --> 01:24:26.468
Oh, my God.

01:24:26.576 --> 01:24:29.101
Oh, you poor kid. Come here.

01:25:17.722 --> 01:25:19.349
Joy.

01:25:19.457 --> 01:25:21.220
Joy, it's been so long.

01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:23.384
- Andy, no. No.
- Please don't forget me again,Joy.

01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:25.655
- I have no one else.
- No!

01:25:47.515 --> 01:25:50.382
You're the only one
who hasn't forgotten me.

01:25:57.291 --> 01:25:58.918
Allen.

01:25:59.026 --> 01:26:00.584
Oh.

01:26:00.694 --> 01:26:02.321
But you cut and ran.

01:26:02.428 --> 01:26:07.195
Oh, I know I should never have left you.
Never.

01:26:07.301 --> 01:26:09.667
- Please forgive me.
- Too late.

01:26:09.769 --> 01:26:13.933
Oh, but, sweetheart,
isn't there anything that I can do?

01:26:14.039 --> 01:26:15.267
Anything.

01:26:15.373 --> 01:26:18.001
Anything to - to -

01:26:22.514 --> 01:26:24.414
Two things.

01:26:24.516 --> 01:26:25.949
What?

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:27.984
What? Tell me.

01:26:28.085 --> 01:26:30.918
Delete everything off my computer.

01:26:31.889 --> 01:26:34.881
All the Web sites and subscriptions.

01:26:34.992 --> 01:26:36.960
Oh. Okay.

01:26:38.061 --> 01:26:39.392
What else?

01:26:43.232 --> 01:26:46.565
Do what I did -
put a bullet through your temple.

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:50.664
Gun in mouth is also okay.

01:26:52.274 --> 01:26:55.266
And then write a note saying...

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.241
"I am a terrible person.

01:26:58.079 --> 01:27:00.912
I tried to improve the world, but failed.

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:05.252
War is evil, but what I did was worse. "

01:27:06.019 --> 01:27:11.150
I will never rest until I see that you know
what it is to suffer like I did.

01:27:12.591 --> 01:27:14.058
Oh, Allen, I -

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.754
I don't know, Allen.

01:27:16.862 --> 01:27:21.595
I really think I'd prefer taking pills.

01:27:24.269 --> 01:27:26.760
Then remember to mix them
with alcohol.

01:27:28.006 --> 01:27:31.134
And to tie a plastic bag
around your head afterwards.

01:27:31.242 --> 01:27:34.109
What -What if I end up a vegetable?

01:27:34.211 --> 01:27:37.078
- You won't.
- But I don't want to die.

01:27:38.715 --> 01:27:40.842
You die for me...

01:27:41.952 --> 01:27:44.580
and I will know you loved me.

01:27:54.463 --> 01:27:56.556
Shh.

01:27:58.967 --> 01:28:00.434
Allen...

01:28:02.170 --> 01:28:04.638
did you meet any angels?

01:28:08.275 --> 01:28:09.435
Yeah.

01:28:11.312 --> 01:28:12.779
I mean, sure.

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.608
Lots of really nice, friendly people.

01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:21.552
Do they think this is
the right thing to do?

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:24.454
An eye for an eye?

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.794
Then comes forgiveness.

01:29:04.693 --> 01:29:06.593
Where is Timmy?

01:29:32.551 --> 01:29:34.109
I'll be back in five.

01:29:44.395 --> 01:29:45.384
Hi.

01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:47.497
Hey.

01:29:47.598 --> 01:29:50.032
Congratulations on becoming a man.

01:29:51.934 --> 01:29:53.526
Thanks.

01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:55.867
I heard your dad was leaving.

01:29:55.972 --> 01:29:56.961
Yep.

01:29:57.073 --> 01:29:58.836
Your mom tell you?

01:29:59.976 --> 01:30:01.273
Yeah.

01:30:01.944 --> 01:30:03.411
Where is he moving to?

01:30:03.512 --> 01:30:04.479
Israel.

01:30:04.579 --> 01:30:06.479
But why?

01:30:06.581 --> 01:30:08.913
Isn't it dangerous there?

01:30:09.016 --> 01:30:11.678
What makes you think there won't be
a terrorist attack here?

01:30:12.888 --> 01:30:15.686
I mean, if I were Al-Qaeda,
this part of Florida is a gold mine.

01:30:18.092 --> 01:30:21.493
Anyway, I don't think he's too focused
on survival these days.

01:30:23.997 --> 01:30:26.158
I'm sorry I made a mistake.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.993
I mean,
even if your dad is a pedophile...

01:30:31.104 --> 01:30:32.594
he should be allowed to get married.

01:30:32.705 --> 01:30:34.195
He's not a pedophile.

01:30:34.306 --> 01:30:36.604
- Yeah, but even if he is.
- He's not.

01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:40.677
I know.

01:30:42.181 --> 01:30:43.910
I'm sorry.

01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:48.180
Forget about it. It's over.

01:30:50.587 --> 01:30:52.111
What if I -

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:01.426
My father visited my brother
up at college a few weeks ago.

01:31:02.631 --> 01:31:07.227
They hung out for a little while,
and then... he left.

01:31:09.371 --> 01:31:11.066
Disappeared.

01:31:11.873 --> 01:31:13.636
Nobody knows where.

01:31:16.478 --> 01:31:20.209
My mom thinks he's probably
lying somewhere dead in a gutter.

01:31:21.316 --> 01:31:23.546
And for real this time.

01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:25.550
But...

01:31:25.652 --> 01:31:27.552
he wasn't a pedophile either.

01:31:27.654 --> 01:31:30.714
<i>He wasn't.</i>

01:31:31.657 --> 01:31:33.147
He wasn't.

01:31:35.795 --> 01:31:38.525
I'm sorry I freaked out before.

01:31:41.399 --> 01:31:43.799
It was before my bar mitzvah.

01:31:44.669 --> 01:31:46.500
I was still just -

01:31:49.007 --> 01:31:50.634
I was -

01:31:55.045 --> 01:31:56.569
Please.

01:32:00.116 --> 01:32:01.583
Sure.

01:32:02.352 --> 01:32:04.047
Forgive and forget.

01:32:05.021 --> 01:32:07.421
But it's like freedom and democracy.

01:32:08.124 --> 01:32:12.254
In the end, China will take over,
and none of this will matter.

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:16.896
I don't care
about freedom and democracy.

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:23.429
I just want my father.
