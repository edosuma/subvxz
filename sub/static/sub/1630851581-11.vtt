You'll learn the corridor

You're not leaving
until my office is shipshape!

00:43.377 --> 00:44.419
What a creep!

00:50.884 --> 00:51.718
(Gasps)

01:04.147 --> 01:06.567
Man, I thought school
would never end!

01:06.567 --> 01:09.236
‐ I seriously need to chill.
‐ Oh, me too.

01:09.236 --> 01:12.364
Hey, you guys wanna train
with a ghost simulation?

01:12.364 --> 01:16.868
Not my idea of chilling.
Let's grab a bite at Roland's.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.954
Or prep for tomorrow's test.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.164
It'll be quicker
if we study together.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.876
Hello? Kids?
Get to the lab, now!

01:43.312 --> 01:45.022
What's the emergency, Ms Jones?

01:45.147 --> 01:48.900
This is huge!
After months of research,

01:48.900 --> 01:52.279
I've finally found a way
to improve Glowboo's features!

01:52.362 --> 01:55.907
‐ He's upgrading as we speak.
‐ Glowboo's features?

01:55.907 --> 01:57.743
‐ What can he do now?
‐ Let's see.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.662
He's waterproof up to a depth
of 10,000 metres,

02:00.662 --> 02:03.498
his solar Boo energy
is stronger than the sun,

02:03.582 --> 02:07.753
and he can talk in 58,
no, 59 languages!

02:07.836 --> 02:10.922
Oh! I can't wait
to see him in action!

02:11.006 --> 02:14.926
Sweet, you're gonna be a force
to reckon with, Glowboo!

02:14.926 --> 02:18.263
I wish I could speak Spanish...
or anything else.

02:18.263 --> 02:21.642
You have outdone yourself,
Ms Jones! Give me five!

02:23.018 --> 02:26.188
So, what're we gonna do
once Glowboo's up and running?

02:26.188 --> 02:28.649
He'll be one of
the most ultimate superheroes

02:28.649 --> 02:30.317
New York's ever seen!

02:30.400 --> 02:32.819
So, who wants to check out
his new features?

02:32.819 --> 02:35.572
‐ Bring it!
‐ Then right this way!

02:36.573 --> 02:38.450
‐ What's up with you?
‐ Think about it.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.412
With an army of super‐Glowboos,
is Ms Jones gonna need us?

02:42.412 --> 02:44.748
Huh? Of course she will!

02:44.748 --> 02:48.043
You do realise that Glowboo
is here to protect us, right?

02:55.717 --> 02:58.136
‐ (Crash)
‐ (Gasps) Oh, no!

02:58.136 --> 02:59.971
Aw...

03:04.976 --> 03:06.645
‐ Aaah!
‐ Boo!

03:06.728 --> 03:10.440
Aaah! Aaah!

03:13.110 --> 03:14.778
Aaah!

03:15.195 --> 03:17.864
(Evil laugh)

03:18.532 --> 03:21.952
Aaah!

03:23.620 --> 03:25.747
Uh‐oh!
Show and tell's over, kids.

03:25.747 --> 03:29.501
We got a ghost on the loose!
I've run in to this type before.

03:29.584 --> 03:33.046
It's a level‐5 Cyclopy that can
copy everything it sees.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.341
Nice. I'd pass a lot more tests
if I was allowed to copy.

03:36.425 --> 03:39.469
‐ (Laughs)
‐ I'll interrupt the upgrade.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.597
‐ We can run it again later.
‐ No! He can sit this one out.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.765
We've got this.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.478
OK, but call for backup
if there's trouble.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.813
Got it, Ms Jones!

03:49.813 --> 03:51.982
Let's go, Ghost Force!

03:52.983 --> 03:55.360
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

04:00.949 --> 04:02.159
Fury!

04:03.368 --> 04:04.870
Krush!

04:05.912 --> 04:07.122
Myst!

04:10.667 --> 04:11.877
Ghost Force!

04:16.298 --> 04:18.675
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

04:19.843 --> 04:22.679
‐ Boo!
‐ (Screaming)

04:23.805 --> 04:25.766
‐ (Laughs)
‐ There's our freaky phantom!

04:31.521 --> 04:33.732
‐ (Laughter)
‐ Fractal power!

04:37.319 --> 04:40.572
Everyone out before it copies
the encyclopaedia section!

04:40.697 --> 04:42.908
Not the encyclopaedia section!

04:42.908 --> 04:44.743
Aaah!

04:45.702 --> 04:48.330
This ghost is in the Boo cap!

04:53.126 --> 04:54.169
Ha, ha!

04:55.128 --> 04:57.339
‐ (Gasps)
‐ (Laughter)

05:02.552 --> 05:04.930
Keep your hands and eye
off my sis!

05:06.097 --> 05:07.808
Flexy power!

05:13.772 --> 05:15.649
(Laughter)

05:19.945 --> 05:21.321
It stole my move!

05:21.404 --> 05:23.323
That means it can even
copy Boo energy.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.158
We should call for backup.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.536
Why? That floating unibrow
just got a bit bigger.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.037
‐ We can deal.
‐ I'm with Liv.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.039
Let's flip that eyeball's lid.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.921
‐ (Laughter)
‐ (Screaming)

05:43.927 --> 05:45.804
Take cover!

05:45.887 --> 05:47.097
(Cheering)

05:48.723 --> 05:50.600
Cyclopy's power
comes from its eye.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.894
‐ We've gotta shut it somehow.
‐ I'm on it.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.274
Yo, Boo‐ball,
Flexyboo slinging is my move!

05:59.109 --> 06:03.113
Aaah!
I didn't mean it literally!

06:03.113 --> 06:04.322
Spectral gate!

06:05.198 --> 06:07.742
Close your eye
for a big surprise!

06:20.088 --> 06:21.423
Fractal mace!

06:28.430 --> 06:29.556
(Laughter)

06:30.307 --> 06:31.182
Aaah!

06:35.061 --> 06:35.896
Huh?

06:39.858 --> 06:41.776
Nice save, Myst. That was close.

06:41.860 --> 06:45.196
‐ We can't let it get away!
‐ Wait! We need Glowboo's help!

06:45.322 --> 06:47.574
Why?
We we're totally rocking this!

06:47.574 --> 06:50.577
Are we? Cyclopy's
copied Fury's Boo energy

06:50.660 --> 06:52.203
and my double mace.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.914
That ghost is maxed out!
I'm calling Ms Jones.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.293
Don't you get it? Ms Jones
will replace us unless we prove

06:58.293 --> 07:00.420
we can do this without Glowboo.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.632
Myst, I really don't think
that she'd do that.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.759
‐ But...
‐ FURY: Guys? Where you at?

07:05.759 --> 07:08.928
Cyclopy's doing a drum solo
on 5th Avenue!

07:08.928 --> 07:10.138
Aaah!

07:10.972 --> 07:13.975
‐ My brother needs us!
‐ Don't let it copy your powers,

07:14.059 --> 07:16.936
‐ or we are ghost toast!
‐ I'm not gonna let that happen.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.576
‐ Ooh!
‐ Ah!

07:31.576 --> 07:34.162
You finally showed up
for our drum circle! Gah!

07:36.831 --> 07:37.707
Krush!

07:41.127 --> 07:43.004
‐ (Laughter)
‐ Oh, no!

07:48.385 --> 07:49.761
Woohoo!

07:49.844 --> 07:51.721
Myst! What are you doing?

07:51.846 --> 07:54.099
Saving your butt!
I didn't have much of a choice!

07:58.853 --> 08:00.021
Flexy shield!

08:04.943 --> 08:05.860
Fury!

08:08.613 --> 08:12.951
I'll be fine, but I'm benched
for now. My Boo energy is over.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.580
This mission's getting too hot.
You call Ms Jones or I will.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.543
All right!

08:41.146 --> 08:42.230
Argh!

08:43.189 --> 08:44.399
(Sounds fearful)

08:44.399 --> 08:45.984
(Laughter)

08:52.741 --> 08:55.368
‐ Uh, Ms Jones?
‐ What's your status?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.203
Uh... We're gonna need backup.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.623
Glowboo's just finished
his upgrade. He's on his way,

09:00.623 --> 09:04.419
‐ all new and improved!
‐ I bet he is. Aaah!

09:05.336 --> 09:06.755
Ha, ha!

09:13.053 --> 09:14.387
Oh!

09:18.767 --> 09:22.187
Hola, ni hao and namaste, Myst.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.106
‐ What is that?
‐ It is one of my new functions.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.776
Now tell me, how may I assist?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.944
Boo‐dazzle that ghost.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.738
Aaah!

09:44.876 --> 09:46.753
Aha!

09:47.087 --> 09:48.421
Initiating Boo‐dazzle.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.102
I am going to need your help,
Myst.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.353
My... My help?

10:04.395 --> 10:05.271
Go!

10:32.465 --> 10:34.676
Ever thought about
getting sunglasses?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.138
Octocat!

11:06.082 --> 11:08.293
(Cheering)

11:11.379 --> 11:13.381
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!

11:16.968 --> 11:17.802
Boo‐yah!

11:23.057 --> 11:27.937
That ghost was one of a kind.
Ha, ha! Excellent work, kids.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.982
It's mainly thanks to Glowboo.
He did all the work.

11:30.982 --> 11:34.152
So, I guess that means
we're pretty much obsolete

11:34.152 --> 11:36.112
now that Glowboo can go solo.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.616
Remind me who found Cyclopy's
Achilles' heel?

11:39.616 --> 11:42.827
You're as valuable a member
of the Ghost Force as Glowboo!

11:43.369 --> 11:45.663
‐ All of you are.
‐ Hey, Ms Jones,

11:45.663 --> 11:47.540
what's
all this greyed‐out stuff?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.501
Those are features
I haven't decoded yet.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.129
Decoded? Aren't you
the one who made Glowboo?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.006
An old friend of mine
designed him.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.800
And I still have
a few of his notes to decipher

11:57.800 --> 12:00.345
before Glowboo
can reach his full potential.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.389
You mean Glowboo
can become even more advanced?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.725
Just don't get a big head,
buddy!

12:05.808 --> 12:08.019
‐ Huh?
‐ Whoa!

12:08.102 --> 12:10.897
I guess there're still
some bugs to be corrected!

12:12.732 --> 12:16.027
(Lively music‐hall tune)

12:38.299 --> 12:40.301
(Whistling)

12:52.188 --> 12:56.609
So cool! Florio the Magic Man's
show is finally in town!

12:56.693 --> 13:00.321
My mind is literally gonna be
blown away by his new tricks!

13:00.321 --> 13:03.491
They might be mind‐blowing,
but they're still just tricks.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.494
But you'd never know how
he does 'em with his mad skills.

13:06.494 --> 13:10.123
I'm sure I could figure it out.
I'm a keen observer.

13:10.123 --> 13:14.669
‐ (Chuckling)
‐ And... poof! It's disappeared!

13:17.422 --> 13:18.506
Professor Pascal?

13:22.677 --> 13:25.096
‐ What are you doing here?
‐ Hello kids!

13:25.179 --> 13:27.598
I'm a member
of the magician's guild,

13:27.598 --> 13:29.934
and they hired me
to entertain the audience

13:29.934 --> 13:31.769
while they wait
for the main show.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.938
‐ Wanna see a trick?
‐ Totally!

13:34.063 --> 13:36.441
So, Mike, think you can
figure out the trick?

13:36.441 --> 13:38.943
‐ Of course!
‐ Pick a card, any card,

13:38.943 --> 13:40.737
and give your friends a peek.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.241
Now place your card on the deck.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.621
And... Abracadabra!

13:51.581 --> 13:53.833
Wait. Mike's card
was a seven of clubs.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.920
Which has vanished
before your very eyes!

13:57.920 --> 13:59.464
‐ Woof!
‐ So...

13:59.464 --> 14:01.549
how'd he pull that one off,
Mike?

14:01.549 --> 14:05.219
I don't get it. I had my eye
on it the whole time.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.013
I bet you hid it up your sleeve!

14:07.096 --> 14:09.932
There's gotta be some
kind of gizmo under the table.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.895
Sorry, Mike,
but magic defies all logic.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.273
‐ Huh?
‐ Whoa!

14:20.818 --> 14:22.695
‐ Huh?
‐ I'm pretty sure

14:22.695 --> 14:24.197
that's not part of the show.

14:24.781 --> 14:29.160
‐ Aaah!
‐ Aaah!

14:29.619 --> 14:30.953
(Laughter)

14:33.498 --> 14:36.459
Oh!
Has the show already started?

14:39.087 --> 14:42.465
Let me guess, you are calling
about the ghost of the day?

14:42.590 --> 14:46.094
Meet GMAGIA, a level‐fiver
who loves to merge!

14:46.219 --> 14:50.640
So, Boocap it before it happens!
Glowboo will assist you.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.434
I mean, after he finishes
making my smoothie.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.063
More prunes, Glowboo!

14:57.146 --> 14:59.023
I think we got this.
Right, guys?

14:59.023 --> 15:02.318
I don't get it. How'd that card
just vanish into thin air

15:02.318 --> 15:04.320
when Professor Pascal
did his trick?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.447
I was watching it.
It didn't even budge.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.282
‐ Aaah!
‐ The magic show's over.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.618
We've got a real trickster
to deal with now.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.453
Wait. If the card didn't budge,

15:12.537 --> 15:15.498
maybe it's still
in Professor Pascal's deck!

15:15.581 --> 15:18.167
Pick a card, any card,
my good sir!

15:24.715 --> 15:26.634
(Gasp)

15:28.970 --> 15:30.680
(Laughter)

15:36.686 --> 15:38.563
Let's go, Ghost Force!

15:39.480 --> 15:42.024
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

15:47.697 --> 15:49.115
Fury!

15:49.866 --> 15:50.950
Krush!

15:52.410 --> 15:53.744
Myst!

15:57.206 --> 15:58.624
Ghost Force!

16:01.752 --> 16:03.504
‐ Oh!
‐ (Laughter)

16:03.504 --> 16:04.630
‐ Ah!
‐ A ghost!

16:04.714 --> 16:06.966
Whoa!

16:07.967 --> 16:09.302
Ho, ho, ho!

16:17.143 --> 16:19.729
‐ Aaah!
‐ (Laughter)

16:37.622 --> 16:39.123
So, what's the plan, Myst?

16:39.248 --> 16:40.791
I say we jam its hat.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.293
That's where
it deals its cards from.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.463
‐ Wait. The cards are my proof!
‐ Proof of what?

16:45.546 --> 16:47.590
The ghost merged
with the deck of cards.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.467
So if it deals a seven of clubs,

16:49.550 --> 16:52.428
that proves that my card
was still in the deck!

16:52.553 --> 16:55.765
‐ This is not a good time for ‐‐
‐ Watch out!

17:02.021 --> 17:03.981
(Laughter)

17:08.986 --> 17:10.947
Aw, man, that's all we need!

17:11.447 --> 17:14.116
Try jamming its hat while
I handle the balloons,

17:14.116 --> 17:16.244
‐ er, people.
‐ On it, sis!

17:26.087 --> 17:29.715
I'll pop right back for you!
Er, bad choice of words.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.195
Cover me, Krush!

18:01.330 --> 18:04.417
Ace of hearts. Five of spades.
Four of diamonds.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.840
Seven of clubs!
Here it is. I knew it!

18:13.884 --> 18:15.469
Krush! What are you doing?

18:15.469 --> 18:17.305
That was a seven of clubs!

18:18.306 --> 18:20.099
‐ Ho!
‐ Huh?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.435
‐ Ho, ho!
‐ Aaah!

18:23.894 --> 18:25.730
‐ Ow!
‐ Oh, no!

18:26.355 --> 18:27.732
Ho, ho, ho!

18:28.441 --> 18:30.234
You OK, Fury?

18:34.572 --> 18:36.949
(Laughter)

18:39.869 --> 18:41.871
Activate emergency protocol.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.837
He's after Glowboo,
come on, guys!

18:53.049 --> 18:56.218
Dude, we almost had that ghost
wrapped and Boo‐capped.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.263
‐ Why didn't you cover me?
‐ Sorry. It was my bad.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.182
‐ But I was right!
‐ About what?

19:01.349 --> 19:04.685
Professor Pascal's trick!
The seven was in the deck!

19:14.111 --> 19:16.405
Dude, this has got to stop.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.034
We need your head in the game,
and I don't mean card game!

19:20.117 --> 19:21.494
Oh, hold up.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.334
We had a plan, Krush.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.502
Why are you so obsessed

19:29.502 --> 19:32.004
with
figuring out the trick anyway?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.506
Because that's my thing!

19:33.673 --> 19:36.509
Andy's the funny one, you
are the bravest and me...

19:36.592 --> 19:39.512
I'm supposed to be the official
brainiac of the crew.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.347
‐ Huh?
‐ I'm sorry,

19:41.430 --> 19:43.516
but I've gotta
figure out that trick.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.768
‐ It's really important to me.
‐ OK,

19:45.893 --> 19:48.646
but you can't always
figure something out right away.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.107
The answer will come to you
sooner or later.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.860
Yes.
I'll figure it out eventually.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.654
For now,
let's capture that ghost.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.864
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

20:03.994 --> 20:05.371
Glowboo!

20:05.454 --> 20:06.914
Let's boo out!

20:13.295 --> 20:14.880
Spectral gate!

20:32.481 --> 20:33.858
Fractal mace!

20:40.322 --> 20:41.031
Huh?

20:49.957 --> 20:51.167
Aaah!

20:57.089 --> 21:00.134
‐ Ah!
‐ (Laughter)

21:05.556 --> 21:06.640
Your turn, Myst!

21:10.895 --> 21:13.063
‐ Aaah!
‐ Myst!

21:14.023 --> 21:15.316
(Laughter)

21:42.676 --> 21:45.221
Don't overthink it, bro!
It's just magic!

21:45.221 --> 21:48.682
‐ Uh‐oh!
‐ Abracadabra!

21:51.727 --> 21:53.687
Yeah!

21:53.687 --> 21:55.189
It's my turn, Houdini!

21:57.733 --> 21:59.235
Gromax!

22:35.396 --> 22:36.272
What happened?

22:38.399 --> 22:41.610
Status update.
Currently craving carrots.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.781
‐ Well done, dude!
‐ Boo‐yah!

23:08.512 --> 23:13.058
A time‐out in the Ghost Cloud
should dampen your magic show.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.729
So, figured out
the magic trick yet, Mike?

23:16.729 --> 23:18.898
I still don't understand
how he did it,

23:18.981 --> 23:20.232
but I'm working on it.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.734
Well, take your time.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.902
You've got plenty now!

23:22.985 --> 23:26.113
Oh! I could sure go for
a cookie. Anyone want one?

23:26.113 --> 23:29.575
One? No thanks.
But two, you bet!

23:29.658 --> 23:33.245
That's it! Professor Pascal
didn't pick up just one card,

23:33.245 --> 23:35.247
he picked two!

23:35.247 --> 23:38.709
Watch. Say I tell you that I'm
taking the top card of the deck,

23:38.709 --> 23:40.794
but I really take
the top two cards

23:40.920 --> 23:43.464
‐ and line 'em up together.
‐ I can't believe it!

23:43.589 --> 23:45.674
He actually figured it out!

23:45.674 --> 23:48.844
Of course he did, he's
our official brainiac, remember?
