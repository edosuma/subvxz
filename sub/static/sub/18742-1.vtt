01:14.033 --> 01:15.910
Hello. Package.

01:22.834 --> 01:26.087
No idea what my brother ordered again.

01:27.797 --> 01:29.090
Toni!

01:29.382 --> 01:31.593
Did you order something?

01:32.886 --> 01:35.972
He just got out of prison,
he does what he wants.

01:38.057 --> 01:40.727
He was locked up for mail bombs.

01:41.352 --> 01:44.564
Yesterday, he ate the dog's food.

01:44.731 --> 01:46.649
Wait a minute.

01:50.653 --> 01:52.113
Come here.

01:53.531 --> 01:56.034
Get your ass out of the hammock.

01:57.076 --> 02:00.038
Keep this up and I'll kick you out.

02:00.872 --> 02:04.375
Did you order something
from Venus Shipping again?

02:04.918 --> 02:06.628
No, I didn't.

02:06.795 --> 02:08.713
Don't be so mean to me.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.967
- Go to the door, the man's waiting.
- Where?

02:13.134 --> 02:14.928
At the door! Man!

02:15.762 --> 02:17.347
Where?

02:17.514 --> 02:19.432
What, where's the guy?

02:24.020 --> 02:28.191
My brother's lying,
I've never ordered anything erotic.

02:29.234 --> 02:31.486
I don't care what's inside.

02:32.237 --> 02:33.863
Better that way.

02:34.030 --> 02:35.990
Give it to me.

02:36.699 --> 02:39.160
I'm looking forward to defusing it.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.538
Do I have to sign?

02:49.087 --> 02:51.089
Lukas? What's...?

02:52.215 --> 02:53.716
Hi.

02:53.883 --> 02:56.845
My colleague, the defuser.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.013
In you go.

03:04.477 --> 03:06.104
I'll sign.

03:09.148 --> 03:10.817
No, don't worry, it's...

03:13.152 --> 03:16.781
It's just my blood pressure monitor.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.951
That was both me. You knew, right?

03:22.537 --> 03:24.372
No offense.

03:24.789 --> 03:25.915
Thanks.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.375
Bye.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.302
Be right there.

03:39.721 --> 03:41.556
Let's get some air.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.853
He can't see anymore.

03:50.315 --> 03:52.984
But our lesson is tomorrow, right?

03:53.401 --> 03:55.361
Yeah, well...

03:56.613 --> 03:59.782
I wanted to tell you that...

04:01.618 --> 04:04.579
I want to quit taking piano lessons.

04:10.001 --> 04:12.420
I just don't have the time anymore.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.423
We saw this coming, right?

04:17.175 --> 04:18.635
Yeah, I guess.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.848
What do I do with the piano now?

04:24.724 --> 04:27.143
I got it just for you.

04:30.063 --> 04:31.105
Just kidding.

04:33.775 --> 04:34.943
Listen...

04:35.652 --> 04:37.987
There's this ball again.

04:38.738 --> 04:40.865
I tried to Google something.

04:42.241 --> 04:45.078
I need makeup for a school celebration.

04:46.162 --> 04:48.289
Yeah, it froze.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.100
Yes, my dear.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.082
Don't be frightened.

05:33.751 --> 05:34.961
Oh, Willi.

05:43.845 --> 05:46.264
Why don't you put him to sleep?

05:48.099 --> 05:52.437
- He's only suffering.
- I don't put you to sleep either.

06:00.528 --> 06:03.031
Yeah, I brought you <i>tartes flambées.</i>

06:03.406 --> 06:04.782
They're really good.

06:05.283 --> 06:07.243
Just have to warm them up.

06:07.702 --> 06:09.370
You eat this?

06:10.163 --> 06:11.748
Sometimes.

06:13.583 --> 06:14.625
Take them back.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.672
- Now sit down.
- But I...

06:20.631 --> 06:22.550
...have to go soon.

06:26.137 --> 06:29.140
The Dombrechts are cutting
your hedges tomorrow.

06:29.474 --> 06:32.018
You're blocking all their sun.

06:37.315 --> 06:39.067
That's fine.

06:39.817 --> 06:43.613
So I can shoot directly
into their living room. Perfect.

06:50.244 --> 06:54.290
I might bring Ines tomorrow.
She's passing through.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.209
She's here?

07:11.599 --> 07:13.684
Don't be frightened, Mrs. Radica.

07:16.729 --> 07:18.898
- Everything okay?
- Yes, good, good.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.075
Can I borrow this?

07:31.077 --> 07:33.037
What's with the outfit?

07:33.204 --> 07:35.206
So you are interested?

07:35.373 --> 07:39.710
I've taken on a side job
in an old people's home.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.172
Fifty euros per killing.

07:44.674 --> 07:46.717
Most won't fight back.

07:51.055 --> 07:56.227
—your 34 years of service
at the Laurensberg School.

07:57.812 --> 08:02.275
For your new stage of life,
this advice from an unknown poet:

08:02.650 --> 08:06.863
"How glorious it is to do nothing
and to then take a break."

08:14.787 --> 08:18.291
Thanks to class 7B's art club.

08:19.167 --> 08:22.503
Now we're looking forward
to seeing 6D and 8B...

08:22.670 --> 08:27.508
...in a musical performance
directed by Mr. Conradi and Mrs. Eikamp.

08:45.109 --> 08:46.611
Three, four...

08:46.777 --> 08:52.783
We're dead sad that you're leaving,
Mr. Dudinger.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.084
<i>Here today, gone tomorrow</i>

09:02.251 --> 09:04.503
<i>Just arrived, gotta go</i>

09:04.670 --> 09:08.341
<i>I've never complained about that</i>

09:38.204 --> 09:40.498
My God, what's this?

09:40.665 --> 09:42.583
I have an upset stomach.

09:43.042 --> 09:45.253
What are you up to?

09:45.419 --> 09:47.755
I was about to get my gun.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.007
You have a gun?

09:50.174 --> 09:51.926
Of course I do.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.764
Were you at school like that?

09:56.931 --> 09:59.517
No, I'm working part-time...

09:59.684 --> 10:01.727
...at an old people's home.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.729
Interesting.

10:15.157 --> 10:16.784
Bärbel, hello.

10:20.288 --> 10:21.414
Hello.

10:24.125 --> 10:25.876
- Winfried.
- Babette.

10:26.043 --> 10:29.380
- Winfried, hello.
- Great that you'll be parents.

10:30.965 --> 10:33.092
Stay together, right?

10:33.551 --> 10:35.469
Red, white or beer?

10:36.512 --> 10:38.389
Whatever you're having.

10:38.556 --> 10:41.100
- Isn't she here yet?
- Yes, she's on the phone.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.450
- Here.
- Thanks.

11:00.328 --> 11:01.746
Her flight was okay?

11:03.622 --> 11:05.124
She was tired.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.586
But things went very well in Shanghai.

11:09.879 --> 11:11.881
Isn't she in Bucharest anymore?

11:12.048 --> 11:16.344
Sure, but she had meetings there,
she wants to go there next.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.433
It all went very well.

11:24.101 --> 11:28.773
They're opening a branch there.
So she met managers of Siemens.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.816
New clients.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.735
Executives too.

11:33.736 --> 11:37.865
It's incredible the heavyweights
she's in the ring with.

11:38.282 --> 11:41.952
- Sure.
- And what does she do in Bucharest?

11:42.495 --> 11:44.622
Oil. In the oil business.

11:46.040 --> 11:50.294
She only advises an oil company.
She's still just a consultant.

11:52.046 --> 11:54.757
I have to write it down myself.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.723
Whose birthday is it?

12:04.350 --> 12:06.727
We decided to celebrate early.

12:07.686 --> 12:10.022
Oh, come on. You have to...

12:11.440 --> 12:13.984
You have to let me know.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.030
Talking business again? Hello, Dad.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.491
Spaghetti.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.454
- How's it going?
- Really well, actually.

12:27.581 --> 12:32.711
Sorry, I didn't know
we were celebrating your birthday early.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.631
But I'll soon have...

12:38.968 --> 12:41.846
...a meeting in Bucharest
and will bring your gift.

12:42.263 --> 12:45.599
Sure, anytime. Just ring the bell.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.018
You might be surprised.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.938
- Everything sorted out?
- Yes, it was nothing.

12:51.105 --> 12:53.232
Something's on your blazer.

12:53.399 --> 12:54.984
What?

12:55.401 --> 13:00.030
- Gall soap.
- No, Mom, I have a suitcase full.

13:00.364 --> 13:02.533
That was me. Sorry.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.244
It's just a tiny spot.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.039
What's that?

13:09.206 --> 13:11.375
My blood-pressure monitor.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.295
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

13:14.462 --> 13:15.796
Just routine.

13:15.963 --> 13:19.008
And your outfit?
Am I supposed to get it?

13:20.384 --> 13:23.053
We were joking around
with the kids at school.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.723
I'll wash it off.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.321
I actually have to get going.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.740
Willi is at my mother's.

13:43.199 --> 13:44.742
And? How's he doing?

13:44.909 --> 13:46.744
Quite well, yeah.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.371
Sleeps a lot.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.794
Look here.

13:57.171 --> 14:00.966
Can you fix this
with your professional glue?

14:01.342 --> 14:02.927
It's cracked.

14:04.637 --> 14:07.014
For a private patient I'll do anything.

14:07.181 --> 14:08.474
Right.

14:10.518 --> 14:12.728
Can you make them permanent?

14:13.479 --> 14:15.272
I mean, like, forever.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.942
My crowns are so boring.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.156
She's always on the phone.

14:25.366 --> 14:27.368
We did something wrong.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.377
Come back inside.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.879
I'm still on the phone.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.603
What else did he say? Almost done, Dad.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.605
Yeah, that's good.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.571
I'll call tomorrow anyway to...

15:05.656 --> 15:07.324
...get in touch.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.119
Good that we talked, bye.

15:12.288 --> 15:13.872
Everything okay?

15:14.290 --> 15:15.624
A bit of stress.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.168
- Leaving already?
- Yes, I have to.

15:18.335 --> 15:22.131
- Will you come to Grandma's for breakfast?
- I'm flying at 10.

15:22.298 --> 15:25.259
- Did you tell her I'm here?
- No, it doesn't matter.

15:26.302 --> 15:27.761
I'll call Inge.

15:27.928 --> 15:28.971
Who?

15:29.138 --> 15:31.724
I've hired a substitute daughter.

15:33.017 --> 15:37.187
Great, she can call on your birthday
so I don't need to.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.108
That was a joke, right?

15:42.401 --> 15:45.487
I might still have makeup on.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.489
Oh, I forgot. Thanks.

15:47.656 --> 15:51.368
- Let's Skype real long soon.
- My Skype's working again.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.995
She should work less.

15:53.162 --> 15:55.080
She's doing great.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.469
Willi?

16:19.271 --> 16:20.773
Come inside.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.941
To your basket.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.036
Are you my dear Willi?

18:34.907 --> 18:36.033
Sir?

18:36.200 --> 18:37.367
Sir!

18:37.534 --> 18:39.912
Are you sure you don't want us
to call someone?

18:40.078 --> 18:41.830
Oh, no. Thank you.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.777
Excuse me.

19:54.611 --> 19:55.988
Mr. Conradi?

19:57.656 --> 19:59.449
I've found him. One second.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.286
I'm Anca Pavelescu.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.788
I'm Ms. Conradi's assistant.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.249
Are you still there?

20:15.132 --> 20:16.967
Just passing by.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.303
I know it was a bit...

20:24.641 --> 20:28.437
No, you don't need to come.
I'll find a hotel somewhere.

20:31.315 --> 20:33.400
No, no, nothing's wrong.

20:33.817 --> 20:35.402
Then see you later.

20:35.986 --> 20:37.195
Bye.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.991
So I should follow you.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.538
Sure.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.128
And so here is the Radisson.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.006
This is also one
of the five-star hotels in town.

20:56.173 --> 21:00.177
The restaurant here is excellent.
There is also a very nice cigar lounge.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.972
Great business lounges
for drinks in the evening.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.016
But I'm only the father.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.185
Just holidays.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.228
Sorry.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.148
Yes, please?

21:15.734 --> 21:17.277
Yes, I'm already here.

21:19.947 --> 21:21.406
Sure, okay.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.367
Okay, talk soon.

21:25.535 --> 21:28.497
She asked if you'd like to join her...

21:28.664 --> 21:32.376
...to an American Embassy reception
this evening.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.046
- Was that her?
- Yes, she's still in the meeting.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.050
When she will.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.220
I will let her know.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.057
And how is my daughter?

21:48.266 --> 21:49.309
As a boss?

21:52.729 --> 21:55.232
She's very honest.

21:55.399 --> 21:57.484
And she gives me a lot of feedback...

21:57.651 --> 21:59.361
...about my performance.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.239
"Performance," this means the...

22:03.573 --> 22:05.742
This describes your job?

22:07.035 --> 22:10.497
No, "performance" means
my work in general.

22:11.081 --> 22:12.874
For example, in meetings...

22:13.917 --> 22:16.420
...with the team, dealing with clients.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.672
And what's important?

22:18.839 --> 22:22.092
Most important
when in contact with clients?

22:22.592 --> 22:25.971
No concept makes sense
if the client doesn't want it.

22:26.596 --> 22:31.184
It's an art to tell the client
what he actually wants.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.938
I'm sure my daughter's good at that.

23:00.130 --> 23:01.465
It's here.

23:10.182 --> 23:11.808
Look, she's coming.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.154
That was a long day, right?

23:25.447 --> 23:27.324
Sure, you have to work.

23:28.658 --> 23:31.119
I've really invaded you here.

23:31.286 --> 23:33.330
How long were you sitting there?

23:34.331 --> 23:35.832
Three hours.

23:37.834 --> 23:41.671
I wasn't even sure you recognized me.

23:41.838 --> 23:45.967
I did, but that was the entire
Romanian board of Dacoil.

23:47.219 --> 23:48.887
How was it with Anca?

23:49.346 --> 23:51.640
They were all terribly nice to me.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.142
The driver too.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.645
Concerning this event:

23:56.812 --> 23:59.898
It's a business reception
by the American Embassy...

24:00.065 --> 24:03.193
...with speeches, appetizers, small talk...

24:03.360 --> 24:04.694
That's it.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.696
Can I go like this?

24:07.322 --> 24:09.032
It's okay.

24:09.199 --> 24:13.036
Right, one last thing,
if there's a chance to have a drink...

24:13.203 --> 24:17.624
...with the CEO Mr. Henneberg,
our client, I have to go alone.

24:17.791 --> 24:21.336
I've been fighting hard
for our contract extension.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.881
No concept makes sense
without a client.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.008
You can say you're...

24:27.175 --> 24:29.052
...my father, but...

24:29.594 --> 24:32.556
...you're tired from your culture program.

24:39.146 --> 24:40.397
Go through.

24:46.069 --> 24:47.070
Come on.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.031
Good evening!

24:52.534 --> 24:54.411
We're late already.

24:57.831 --> 25:01.877
—into the European Union was preceded
by a series of government reforms.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.922
Now, the requirements of membership,
including EU directives...

25:06.089 --> 25:07.924
...make up one of the driving forces...

25:08.091 --> 25:11.344
...in Romania's program of reform,
modernization...

25:11.511 --> 25:13.430
...and investment in infrastructure.

25:21.313 --> 25:23.732
So again, why? Why Romania?

25:24.900 --> 25:28.445
Romania offers significant opportunities
to American businesses...

25:28.612 --> 25:31.448
...with products, services
or technologies...

25:31.615 --> 25:33.783
...that either meet
growing private demand...

25:33.950 --> 25:36.953
...or contribute
to the country's development priorities.

25:43.293 --> 25:47.255
Ladies and gentlemen, the buffet is open.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.348
He looks like Tiriac.

25:57.641 --> 25:58.975
Maybe.

26:02.729 --> 26:06.900
Could you grab us something
from the buffet? Please. The buffet.

26:07.067 --> 26:09.486
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
- Thanks.

26:29.172 --> 26:33.551
- Our third time today, good evening.
- Right. Good evening.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.470
A fascinating speech.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.722
We're not where we want to be...

26:37.889 --> 26:42.394
...but Romania has shown economic
strength in overcoming the crisis.

26:43.687 --> 26:45.855
I looked at our case again...

26:46.022 --> 26:49.567
...and I'm sure we'll have
a solid statement on Monday.

26:50.318 --> 26:51.361
Natalja!

26:52.779 --> 26:56.324
This is your specialist!
I'm sure Ms. Conradi can help you.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.327
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.206
Natalja needs to do
some shopping tomorrow.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.792
You're working in Bucharest
for how long?

27:05.959 --> 27:08.670
It's been almost a year now.
You keep me busy.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.589
I guess you can ask her
any shopping question.

27:16.094 --> 27:18.388
I'm sorry for that.
I know that you are busy.

27:18.555 --> 27:20.724
No, no. It's really okay. It's really okay.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.058
What do you need?

27:22.225 --> 27:23.727
I need to go shopping.

27:23.893 --> 27:28.231
Because we have this wedding
this weekend in Moscow.

27:28.398 --> 27:31.192
And I would like to buy some presents.

27:32.444 --> 27:35.905
Well, I don't do
too much shopping here myself...

27:36.072 --> 27:38.116
...but there are several big malls.

27:38.283 --> 27:43.455
Plus, there is an area with exclusive shops.
So it depends on what you need.

27:43.621 --> 27:46.082
- Great! Brilliant. Thank you very much.
- Be my guest.

27:46.249 --> 27:50.128
So why don't you give me your number,
and I'll find the best place and call you.

27:50.879 --> 27:53.089
- So I guess it's Natalja...
- Natalja Henneberg.

27:53.256 --> 27:55.425
Good evening. I'm only the father.

27:56.634 --> 27:58.553
Henneberg. Are you visiting?

28:01.848 --> 28:03.600
A spontaneous decision.

28:05.226 --> 28:06.936
Never been to Romania.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.447
I'm actually here to negotiate with her.

28:18.656 --> 28:22.619
She's hardly home anymore
so I hired a substitute daughter.

28:23.787 --> 28:26.456
Now comes the question who pays her.

28:28.958 --> 28:31.294
- That's a modern solution.
- Exactly.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.632
Is the other daughter better?

28:37.008 --> 28:38.635
The cakes are better.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.640
She cuts my toenails.

28:47.602 --> 28:50.021
But she's not your daughter, right?

28:51.189 --> 28:53.817
I was really impressed
by the Bolshoi Theatre.

28:53.983 --> 28:55.235
Have a nice evening.

28:55.402 --> 28:56.653
Right.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.155
Did you arrange something?

29:00.448 --> 29:03.034
- I wish you a nice evening too.
- You too.

29:03.201 --> 29:04.327
See you tomorrow.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.630
He's the CEO I told you about.
He's a really important contact for me.

29:23.721 --> 29:26.558
I'm freaking out
with these Chinese wannabe investors.

29:28.518 --> 29:30.687
- Are you coming on Monday?
- Text me where.

29:30.854 --> 29:33.690
- Yeah, the DaVinci, 9 p.m.?
- Yeah. Very good.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.692
Very good. I'll see you later.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.027
Hey, let's go to the restroom.

29:48.496 --> 29:50.039
And you? Sorry.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.875
You wanna join us for a drink?

29:52.750 --> 29:55.003
We're going for a drink. Want to come?

29:55.170 --> 29:57.464
- What was your name again?
- Winfried.

29:58.882 --> 30:01.342
Terribly nice of you, but I'm tired.

30:02.051 --> 30:04.345
Busy program today. Cultural program.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.723
But I'd love to grab a drink.
Where are you going?

30:07.599 --> 30:10.059
Your father might want you to join him.

30:11.561 --> 30:12.604
One drink, come on.

30:13.229 --> 30:14.564
I have to sleep.

30:16.399 --> 30:19.903
I walked through
the whole Ceausescu Palace today.

30:20.528 --> 30:22.405
We have two cars. Think about it.

30:24.699 --> 30:26.493
Come on now.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.912
- You want me to come now?
- Yes.

30:30.288 --> 30:33.875
I don't know. At the moment,
my wife is quite happy in Paris, so...

30:34.042 --> 30:37.587
Bring your wife next time.
Spend a weekend. The sea is very close.

30:37.754 --> 30:41.090
There is a big French community here
with excellent private schools.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.634
Oh, really?

30:42.800 --> 30:46.513
Romania is a lot better than its reputation.
She can have a good life here.

30:46.679 --> 30:50.934
- Where you based at the moment?
- In Frankfurt and in France.

30:51.559 --> 30:52.644
That's nice.

30:53.937 --> 30:55.438
I really like Frankfurt.

30:55.605 --> 30:58.566
I like countries with a middle class.
They are relaxing me.

30:58.733 --> 31:01.069
Yes, yes, I totally understand.

31:02.028 --> 31:05.615
We just have to make them change
their corporate culture more and more.

31:06.616 --> 31:08.952
I just told Van Rompuy,
letting Romania in...

31:09.118 --> 31:12.330
...was one of the rare EU decisions
that was actually good.

31:13.289 --> 31:16.960
Tell me something about the young
Romanian manager generation.

31:17.752 --> 31:18.962
What do you want to know?

31:19.128 --> 31:21.005
I mean, how they work, how—

31:21.172 --> 31:24.926
We have a specialist here.
Ms. Conradi knows all the insights.

31:25.093 --> 31:26.594
Ms. Conradi.

31:26.761 --> 31:28.721
When I started I was really surprised...

31:28.888 --> 31:31.933
...because almost everyone
did a master's degree abroad.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.476
They speak several languages.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.770
They're all very dedicated.

31:35.937 --> 31:39.274
Most of them have a very international way
of thinking, which is great.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.818
Yes, but they don't understand
Romania anymore.

31:41.985 --> 31:45.697
They are faster than the rest
of the country, don't want to stay here.

31:45.863 --> 31:47.323
If you want my opinion...

31:47.490 --> 31:52.036
...I'm not exactly a fan
of international perspective.

31:52.203 --> 31:56.165
Yes, Mr. Dascalu. I was just trying
to say that knowledge is international...

31:56.332 --> 31:58.001
...so I agree with that, of course.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.920
Excuse me,
what exactly do you do at Dacoil?

32:01.963 --> 32:05.466
I'm a consultant at Morrisons
and we are working for Dacoil right now...

32:05.633 --> 32:09.012
...evaluating if it will pay off
to outsource some services.

32:09.721 --> 32:11.681
Interesting how you see it.

32:12.682 --> 32:14.976
Sorry. Please say it in your words.

32:17.604 --> 32:22.358
Actually, Ms. Conradi is evaluating a way
to improve our maintenance service...

32:22.525 --> 32:25.903
...but we see outsourcing
as the very last option of many.

32:27.030 --> 32:30.199
Of course, yeah.
This is what I tried to say. I'm sorry.

32:35.288 --> 32:38.708
But her father had a great business idea
for Romania.

32:40.627 --> 32:41.878
He— May I say that?

32:42.045 --> 32:44.547
He hired another girl to be his daughter...

32:44.714 --> 32:48.092
...because this one is never there
and he needs somebody to cut his toenails.

32:53.640 --> 32:54.724
Sorry.

32:56.726 --> 32:59.395
Don't you dare steal my idea.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.444
I like to make jokes.

33:10.448 --> 33:12.867
We're incredibly proud of her.

33:13.284 --> 33:15.453
What she does here and stuff.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.918
You've every right to be.

33:29.926 --> 33:31.427
We are talking on the phone?

33:32.220 --> 33:34.263
Good night, everybody! It's late.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.099
I'm tired.

33:38.893 --> 33:40.728
- Titus.
- Bobby. We'll see you tomorrow.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.606
- Good night.
- Good night.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.197
Good night. See you tomorrow.

33:52.448 --> 33:54.492
What do you say
to a change of location?

33:56.452 --> 33:59.872
Check out a little bit
of the famous Bucharest nightlife?

34:00.039 --> 34:02.125
Find a reason to leave your wife in Paris.

34:02.291 --> 34:03.793
- Let's dance.
- Cheers.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.129
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

34:08.297 --> 34:09.716
Goodbye.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.802
Goodbye.

34:22.645 --> 34:25.606
I had to make it clear it was a joke.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.947
What was that anyway?

34:35.867 --> 34:38.369
What is that... Outsourcing?

34:39.661 --> 34:41.164
What is that?

34:42.831 --> 34:46.627
A transfer of work to another company.
He wants to...

34:46.793 --> 34:50.005
...transfer the maintenance
of the oil installations.

34:53.967 --> 34:56.344
- So, what was wrong?
- Nothing.

34:56.846 --> 34:59.515
I shouldn't have let it slip out.

35:01.476 --> 35:02.810
Why not?

35:03.686 --> 35:08.649
He wants us to prove it's right,
but doesn't want the responsibility.

35:09.192 --> 35:11.527
That's why he needs us.

35:14.781 --> 35:17.200
What would you be responsible for?

35:19.869 --> 35:24.540
Dad, it means hundreds of employees
being transferred and later released.

35:24.707 --> 35:28.377
It's a very unpopular decision,
which is why he needs us.

35:28.544 --> 35:33.382
So you can read again in the paper
that a consulting firm ruined everything.

35:44.435 --> 35:45.686
So...

35:47.355 --> 35:49.732
...how long are you planning to stay?

35:50.233 --> 35:52.360
I took a month off.

36:06.123 --> 36:08.417
That was real fear.

36:55.464 --> 36:59.135
I just have a massage tomorrow,
then I'll show you Bucharest.

37:19.405 --> 37:20.823
Your present.

37:30.333 --> 37:32.668
- Now already?
- Yeah, open it up.

37:34.795 --> 37:36.839
If you don't like it, throw it away.

37:39.216 --> 37:40.343
Thanks.

37:44.430 --> 37:47.183
Why didn't you come on my birthday?

37:47.683 --> 37:49.435
Flight was so cheap.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.363
Thanks.

38:06.035 --> 38:08.371
That's a really good cheese grater.

38:10.831 --> 38:12.041
A French one.

38:13.042 --> 38:14.377
From Designo.

38:19.256 --> 38:22.301
That there is your real present.

38:26.681 --> 38:28.307
Buy yourself a new blazer.

38:29.016 --> 38:32.436
- Or something else.
- You don't have to give me money, Dad.

38:34.855 --> 38:37.274
Hey, where did you leave Willi?

38:39.235 --> 38:40.569
Well, Willi...

38:44.740 --> 38:46.534
Willi unfortunately died.

38:46.701 --> 38:47.868
What?

38:59.380 --> 39:01.257
Man, Dad, I'm really sorry.

39:02.925 --> 39:04.593
He was an old dog.

39:06.929 --> 39:09.140
Why didn't you call me?

39:10.099 --> 39:12.601
I don't always have time either.

39:16.313 --> 39:18.315
Should I cut up some sausage?

39:18.482 --> 39:20.401
Not for me. Thanks.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.713
It was so bad, I walked out.

39:40.880 --> 39:43.674
I'm not paying 100 euros to be petted.

39:53.768 --> 39:56.979
We're really, really sorry
for the inconvenience.

39:57.146 --> 39:58.355
Who was the girl?

39:58.522 --> 40:02.943
It was a blond, skinny woman.

40:03.694 --> 40:06.989
Mariella.
I'm sure she is very sorry right now.

40:07.782 --> 40:11.535
Anyway, there's a time slot in 30 minutes,
with another masseur, Dragos.

40:11.702 --> 40:13.788
Just bring someone who beats me up.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.290
Can I bring you something to drink?

40:16.457 --> 40:17.708
At your expense?

40:19.960 --> 40:22.880
We'd like to have
two glasses of champagne...

40:23.714 --> 40:26.759
...two freshly squeezed orange juices...

40:26.926 --> 40:28.511
...and two club sandwiches.

40:30.387 --> 40:31.639
Be right back.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.393
Wasn't that a bit much?

40:36.560 --> 40:38.104
No, it's fine.

40:38.479 --> 40:40.898
My company spends
so much money here.

40:45.152 --> 40:46.362
So?

40:47.613 --> 40:50.157
Are you at least a bit happy here?

40:55.329 --> 40:59.291
What do you mean by "happy"?
"Happiness" is a strong word.

41:02.086 --> 41:05.714
I mean, if you have a bit of a life too.

41:06.757 --> 41:09.510
Like going to the movies or what?

41:10.177 --> 41:11.804
Well...

41:11.971 --> 41:14.306
...just doing something that's fun.

41:14.682 --> 41:18.644
Lots of words buzzing around,
"fun," "happiness," "life"...

41:18.811 --> 41:20.896
Shall we sort it out?

41:22.189 --> 41:24.692
What do you find worth living for?

41:25.067 --> 41:27.695
If you want to discuss the big topics.

41:32.992 --> 41:35.411
I can't say that right away.

41:35.953 --> 41:38.914
I just wanted to know how you are.

41:39.081 --> 41:41.959
Sure, but then have your own answer.

41:47.715 --> 41:49.967
I know, I've been waiting for your call.

41:53.470 --> 41:55.181
You're not disturbing at all.

41:56.557 --> 41:57.892
You're already there?

41:58.058 --> 42:01.562
I can be there in, I don't know...
Fifteen, 20 minutes?

42:02.646 --> 42:05.816
I know, I know. It's crazy, it's crazy.
Stay where you are.

42:05.983 --> 42:07.401
Your sandwiches.

42:07.735 --> 42:09.486
See you, bye.

42:12.698 --> 42:14.158
Shit.

42:17.119 --> 42:21.040
I have to meet Natalja,
Henneberg's wife, at a mall.

42:21.207 --> 42:24.001
- Sorry, it's important.
- When?

42:24.168 --> 42:25.294
Now.

42:25.794 --> 42:27.546
- Now?
- Yeah.

42:27.713 --> 42:30.716
It's more interesting and Romanian
than the Ceausescu Palace.

42:30.883 --> 42:35.346
It's Europe's largest mall
and no one has money to buy anything.

43:30.401 --> 43:32.528
And tonight, I'm gonna show you my...

43:32.903 --> 43:36.949
I'm so sorry, Mr. Conradi.
This is such an awful place!

43:37.741 --> 43:39.743
Poor thing, you had to wait ages.

43:39.910 --> 43:41.787
Ines, I'm leaving you now.

43:41.954 --> 43:45.207
Thank you very much for everything.
You saved my life today.

43:45.374 --> 43:47.084
I really enjoyed it. Really, I did.

43:55.050 --> 43:57.011
Man, was it very terrible?

43:58.429 --> 44:00.431
Are you really a human?

44:02.975 --> 44:04.768
No, it was great.

44:05.853 --> 44:08.314
I saw wonderful ice-skating.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.150
I went to Lidl too.

44:12.735 --> 44:15.946
So you still want to do something?
Visit the palace?

44:17.990 --> 44:19.491
Or go home?

44:21.035 --> 44:23.662
I could make spaghetti, I went shopping.

44:34.340 --> 44:35.507
Thanks.

44:37.134 --> 44:38.802
Everything okay, spaghetti?

44:42.806 --> 44:44.308
Already hungry?

44:44.475 --> 44:46.226
No, not yet.

44:48.812 --> 44:51.690
Sorry for my stupid comment earlier.

44:51.857 --> 44:53.734
What stupid comment?

44:54.735 --> 44:56.653
Whether you're a human.

44:56.820 --> 45:00.115
Oh, yeah, it's okay.
It's obvious you'd think that.

45:03.952 --> 45:08.832
I'm taking a nap. I probably have to show
the Hennebergs a club later.

45:10.542 --> 45:11.752
See you later.

46:28.078 --> 46:31.081
- I wasn't sure you were still alive.
- What?

46:33.041 --> 46:35.210
- What time is it?
- Nine thirty.

46:35.377 --> 46:37.546
You slept for ages.

46:39.631 --> 46:43.469
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- You were so fast asleep.

46:43.635 --> 46:46.305
But you wanted to wake me up for dinner.

46:46.763 --> 46:48.265
I tried.

46:48.432 --> 46:49.725
Shit.

47:00.110 --> 47:01.361
Shit!

47:02.029 --> 47:04.573
I missed four calls from them.

47:06.408 --> 47:08.410
Do you know what this means for me?

47:08.577 --> 47:11.997
I have a presentation on Monday
I've worked on for weeks.

47:12.164 --> 47:15.584
I can't afford to stand up
someone like him.

47:36.897 --> 47:38.690
I don't know either.

47:39.942 --> 47:43.362
If you're doing as well as you always say.

47:47.950 --> 47:49.993
Even if I wanted
to jump out the window...

47:50.160 --> 47:54.414
...you and the cheese grater wouldn't be
the combination to stop me.

48:10.055 --> 48:14.851
Do you have any plans in life other than
slipping fart cushions under people?

48:16.853 --> 48:19.273
I don't have a fart cushion.

48:26.321 --> 48:29.866
I know men your age with ambitions,
but who cares?

48:58.312 --> 48:59.980
Here's your shampoo.

49:00.856 --> 49:03.442
If you need it, you can keep it.

49:05.444 --> 49:08.363
It's one of the best shampoos in Aachen.

49:11.742 --> 49:14.244
Anyway, it was really nice.

49:16.371 --> 49:17.664
Right.

49:20.459 --> 49:23.462
Let's fix a date next time
and I'll have time.

49:25.464 --> 49:26.506
Right.

49:37.434 --> 49:38.852
Did you get caught?

49:43.815 --> 49:44.941
Don't!

49:57.829 --> 49:58.872
Move it.

50:01.375 --> 50:02.918
I don't think it's broken.

50:17.599 --> 50:19.559
I can't leave you like this.

50:19.726 --> 50:21.853
It's not that bad.

50:26.233 --> 50:29.111
- I'll come down with you, okay?
- No, no way.

50:32.989 --> 50:34.074
Bye.

50:34.616 --> 50:35.659
Bye.

50:40.997 --> 50:43.083
Call me if anything's wrong.

50:43.250 --> 50:44.584
Sure.

51:13.238 --> 51:14.281
Bye.

51:18.535 --> 51:19.578
Bye.

52:20.972 --> 52:22.307
Ten percent...

52:25.602 --> 52:28.021
For option two for one year...

52:28.647 --> 52:30.273
For option one...

52:31.691 --> 52:35.070
...are at 10 percent already
in the first year of the implementation.

52:36.571 --> 52:39.741
Yes, of course, Mr. Dascalu,
I totally agree with you.

52:40.617 --> 52:44.538
Of course we need to go further
into the details of each scenario.

53:10.689 --> 53:12.315
- Morning.
- Hello.

53:20.073 --> 53:21.449
Tarom or Lufthansa?

53:21.616 --> 53:24.619
Always Tarom.
I love Romanian prosecco.

53:25.912 --> 53:27.372
Henneberg came earlier.

53:28.206 --> 53:29.541
How was that?

53:29.958 --> 53:33.628
Boring, or annoying.
I had to shop with his wife for three hours.

53:33.795 --> 53:35.255
But we had dinner.

53:35.422 --> 53:37.799
I put out my feelers, and...

53:38.216 --> 53:41.636
...my impression is that
he's more cautious of outsourcing.

53:41.803 --> 53:43.972
Or that he has new opponents.

53:44.139 --> 53:47.225
That topic definitely caused tension.

53:48.393 --> 53:50.395
That comes as a surprise.

53:50.562 --> 53:54.399
So I reworked the presentation
and think we should definitely...

53:54.566 --> 53:56.318
Use a softer touch?

53:56.484 --> 53:58.486
May I finish? Thanks.

53:58.653 --> 54:01.239
I think we should be more aggressive.

54:01.406 --> 54:06.077
I think he's hoping we decide for him.
That we order it.

54:06.244 --> 54:10.332
He can't speak in favor,
so I'd like to present three options.

54:10.498 --> 54:13.501
A full outsourcing in all assets,
a radical cut.

54:13.668 --> 54:18.506
Then our option in the middle,
which in contrast seems almost harmless.

54:18.673 --> 54:22.886
And a minimal solution
in one pilot field with almost no change.

54:24.846 --> 54:30.018
First, we can't change strategy
so close to a meeting. That's impossible.

54:31.311 --> 54:33.438
- Where did you eat?
- DaVinci.

54:37.025 --> 54:40.195
- I'm not convinced.
- Argument two is Iliescu.

54:40.362 --> 54:42.197
We have to make an issue of him
blocking us.

54:42.364 --> 54:44.950
All figures from Buzău are incomplete.

54:45.116 --> 54:48.370
For a clear business case,
we need much more from Iliescu.

54:48.536 --> 54:50.580
- Every table is flawed...
- But, Ines—

54:50.747 --> 54:52.290
I'm not criticizing you, Tim.

54:52.457 --> 54:57.003
We can't make a clear statement anyway,
so that's why: three options.

54:59.005 --> 55:01.466
Iliescu isn't an issue
for the steering committee.

55:01.633 --> 55:04.010
We'll put this in a comfort zone.

55:04.803 --> 55:08.348
The three options are okay
if you have a good feeling—

55:08.515 --> 55:11.810
Absolutely. Last point: Dascalu.

55:13.019 --> 55:16.815
It's still difficult with him,
he'll definitely be against us.

55:18.483 --> 55:21.152
Hey, will that little Anca be there?

55:21.903 --> 55:24.948
Yes, she'll push the buttons, Gerald.

55:28.284 --> 55:30.245
Do you want me to be there?

55:30.412 --> 55:34.332
I think it's better if I do it alone,
but let's talk later.

56:27.552 --> 56:29.345
I'm sorry, this is not my best.

56:30.013 --> 56:33.933
It's really fine. It's really nice, thank you.
It's just because of the presentation.

56:41.983 --> 56:43.276
She's coming.

56:46.446 --> 56:50.116
I wanted to ask if you're pleased
with my work in general?

56:51.034 --> 56:52.202
Absolutely.

56:52.786 --> 56:54.079
Absolutely, yes.

56:54.245 --> 56:56.331
I think you've really improved.

56:56.915 --> 56:57.957
Thanks.

56:58.124 --> 57:00.168
Just try to speak more German.

57:03.379 --> 57:05.757
I know, but it's not enough for work.

57:06.841 --> 57:08.468
Wait a minute. Sorry.

57:09.219 --> 57:10.929
I think this one is better.

57:17.685 --> 57:22.065
For option one, we assume that it will
take one year for the implementation.

57:22.232 --> 57:24.859
The implementation cost,
internal and external...

57:25.026 --> 57:27.153
...will be around 5 to 6 million euros.

57:27.695 --> 57:31.407
The advantage of a full outsourcing
are the contractor rates.

57:31.574 --> 57:34.744
We will have a strong competition here,
resulting in lower rates...

57:34.911 --> 57:39.082
...and this is why we will end with
a 10 percent cost reduction in the first year.

57:39.249 --> 57:41.126
Sorry, but I have big doubts...

57:41.292 --> 57:45.255
...that we will have
such a strong cost reduction so quickly.

57:45.421 --> 57:49.717
It will take years to transfer
the knowledge to our contractors.

57:49.884 --> 57:52.178
I totally agree with you, Mr. Dascalu.

57:52.345 --> 57:56.057
Of course we need to go further
into the details of each scenario.

57:57.142 --> 57:59.269
Anca, your hair.

57:59.435 --> 58:04.107
But you cannot outsource
maintenance services in only 10 months.

58:04.274 --> 58:05.316
It is impossible.

58:06.067 --> 58:07.694
You know, we have the...

58:11.865 --> 58:14.159
We have 200 workers there.

58:14.325 --> 58:15.577
A lot to...

58:15.743 --> 58:20.623
You must consider high price also
for our part. You know?

58:20.790 --> 58:25.003
For supervising, for training and these kind
of stuff. Sorry, but I didn't saw them there.

58:25.587 --> 58:27.755
What we should
also put into account...

58:27.922 --> 58:29.522
...is that Dacoil didn't even realize...

58:29.591 --> 58:32.427
...international HSSR standards
in all assets, so—

58:32.594 --> 58:36.097
I absolutely agree with Mr. Dascalu
that there are many open questions.

58:36.264 --> 58:39.434
There is a lot that needs
to be analyzed in more detail.

58:39.601 --> 58:42.437
But I would like to support Ms. Conradi.

58:43.146 --> 58:44.647
The big picture will not change...

58:44.814 --> 58:48.318
...and is absolutely in line
with my experiences from other countries.

58:49.277 --> 58:50.528
Thank you, Ines.

58:50.695 --> 58:51.946
Thanks.

58:57.285 --> 58:58.995
Now we need directions, Titus.

59:02.665 --> 59:05.627
We need a fully waterproof
and positive business case...

59:05.793 --> 59:07.629
...before we can start anything.

59:07.795 --> 59:11.507
What you are proposing,
speaking of, option one...

59:11.674 --> 59:14.719
...would mean a too-heavy change
for our operations.

59:14.886 --> 59:17.889
Option two seems more realistic to me
at the moment.

59:18.056 --> 59:20.099
But that also has to be verified legally...

59:20.266 --> 59:23.311
...and we all know how difficult
this will be regarding the unions.

59:23.478 --> 59:25.313
Absolutely, Titus. Absolutely.

59:26.648 --> 59:29.317
But it is a very interesting proposal anyway.

59:29.859 --> 59:32.946
At the end of this month,
we should have all calculations done.

59:33.112 --> 59:36.449
Sorry, but I think
we cannot promise anything...

59:36.616 --> 59:39.744
...as long as the cooperation
with Buzău won't work better.

59:39.911 --> 59:42.622
That's why I would like
to discuss with you, Mr. Dascalu...

59:42.789 --> 59:46.876
...how we can improve
our cooperation with Mr. Iliescu.

59:47.043 --> 59:49.295
How we can work
more closely together with him.

59:50.213 --> 59:52.173
I'll see what I can do.

59:54.175 --> 59:55.593
Gents, get that solved.

59:55.760 --> 59:56.844
Titus.

59:57.011 --> 59:58.972
I think we're done. Thanks a lot.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.412
So?

01:00:25.331 --> 01:00:28.501
I don't like
that you don't stick to agreements.

01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:31.713
The Iliescu issue wasn't very elegant.

01:00:35.341 --> 01:00:37.510
The next steps are clear.

01:00:37.677 --> 01:00:40.805
But please inform me
of any more problems.

01:00:40.972 --> 01:00:42.598
Okay, I will.

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:44.350
But otherwise...

01:00:45.518 --> 01:00:46.644
Well done.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.522
- Thanks.
- You're an animal, Ines.

01:00:55.737 --> 01:00:59.490
- Can I pull up the screen?
- Up? Yeah, sure.

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:27.602
It's me, I just wanted to...

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:32.148
...make sure you got home okay.
I hope the flight was okay.

01:01:32.565 --> 01:01:37.070
I think you still have my key,
but that doesn't really matter.

01:01:42.075 --> 01:01:43.910
Talk soon. Bye.

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:06.265
- And how did it go?
- It was good.

01:02:10.103 --> 01:02:11.813
Come on, don't be offended.

01:02:11.979 --> 01:02:15.233
- Be happy you weren't there.
- I'm not offended.

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:19.987
To quote Gerald:
It's all included in your price.

01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:23.032
Gerald's prices are different than mine.

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:30.665
- So, what are you doing tonight?
- Meeting Steph de Boer and Tatjana.

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:33.793
Women's group.

01:02:35.628 --> 01:02:37.547
What's on the agenda?

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:41.092
Stuff like gender quotas,
sexual harassment at work...

01:02:42.427 --> 01:02:44.512
- Business nail polish?
- Exactly.

01:02:44.679 --> 01:02:45.888
Chic.

01:02:59.569 --> 01:03:01.988
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to get changed after work.

01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:05.783
- You look great.
- Thank you. You too!

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.410
You work way too much, Ines.

01:03:07.577 --> 01:03:12.540
I know, I know. But it's really busy
at the moment. I had this big thing today.

01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:14.917
Well, we still don't have a table.

01:03:16.252 --> 01:03:18.379
They said it's coming, but...

01:03:18.546 --> 01:03:20.715
How was your night with the Chinese?

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:23.384
Well, after 30 minutes they were drunk.

01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:27.138
So I sat there for five hours,
listening to Mandarin.

01:03:27.472 --> 01:03:30.391
But I sold one flat, at least.
So that's good.

01:03:30.558 --> 01:03:32.685
Oh, yeah, because we were
just fighting over...

01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:34.520
...who had the most horrible weekend.

01:03:34.687 --> 01:03:36.189
Steph was in Naples.

01:03:36.898 --> 01:03:39.233
How was it? What happened?

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.777
It's filthy, the food was disgusting.

01:03:42.904 --> 01:03:46.199
Even the kids were dying to get back,
so, you know.

01:03:48.868 --> 01:03:52.997
Well, I probably had the most horrible
weekend of my entire life, actually.

01:03:53.581 --> 01:03:57.627
Yeah. My father visited me
spontaneously, without any warning.

01:03:57.793 --> 01:04:00.087
He was there standing in my office...

01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:02.232
...pretending he wanted to bring me
my birthday present...

01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:07.303
...but actually he was just having a crisis
because his dog died at home.

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:11.140
Henneberg was wanting me to go out
with him and his wife the whole time.

01:04:11.307 --> 01:04:13.309
Henneberg's still in town?

01:04:14.185 --> 01:04:17.230
I should invite him and his wife
to our relaunch.

01:04:17.396 --> 01:04:20.191
And my father was sitting around,
making spaghetti...

01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:25.696
...trying to talk with me about the meaning
of life, whatever that is. Strange.

01:04:25.863 --> 01:04:27.448
So that was your father?

01:04:27.615 --> 01:04:29.659
Yeah, in the— But now he's home.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:32.119
So how was the new wife?

01:04:33.204 --> 01:04:36.165
Very Russian, very skinny, very blond.

01:04:36.332 --> 01:04:37.792
Better be careful.

01:04:37.959 --> 01:04:40.711
May I offer the ladies
a glass of champagne?

01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:44.257
What?

01:04:44.632 --> 01:04:46.384
Do we want champagne?

01:04:46.551 --> 01:04:49.971
Please! I cannot drink all that alone.

01:04:51.389 --> 01:04:52.515
Please, will you?

01:04:52.682 --> 01:04:53.975
Okay, let's go for it.

01:04:54.141 --> 01:04:58.563
Three glasses for the ladies, please,
and one beer for me.

01:05:01.524 --> 01:05:05.570
Yes, I'm waiting for two hours now
for Mr. Tiriac...

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:08.155
...and I think it's enough. Please.

01:05:08.656 --> 01:05:09.865
Ion Tiriac?

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:12.702
I'm Toni.

01:05:13.327 --> 01:05:15.788
Toni Erdmann.

01:05:18.457 --> 01:05:19.667
Ines Conradi.

01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:21.085
Nice to meet you.

01:05:22.086 --> 01:05:23.671
I'm Steph de Boer.

01:05:23.838 --> 01:05:25.548
Steph, nice to meet you.

01:05:26.173 --> 01:05:27.383
I'm Tatjana.

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:30.344
- Tatjana, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Toni.

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:34.682
- Here we go.
- Finally, something to drink!

01:05:38.728 --> 01:05:40.104
Thank you very much.

01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:45.776
You work here in Bucharest, Toni?

01:05:46.736 --> 01:05:48.195
Yes, and no.

01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:51.365
I'm here for shopping.

01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:53.743
And for spa.

01:05:55.036 --> 01:06:01.208
And also I'm here
because of a famous dentist, you know?

01:06:01.876 --> 01:06:05.212
He made all new.
My teeth are too small.

01:06:07.423 --> 01:06:09.800
And I wanted something more wild.

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:12.803
More dangerous.

01:06:15.264 --> 01:06:19.644
Good. So who's your crazy dentist?
Who's that?

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:26.442
This is
the International Dental Design Clinic.

01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:29.070
Bucharest. Very famous.

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:32.782
But the doctor is Italian.

01:06:33.783 --> 01:06:37.036
And he is not a dentist.

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:40.247
He is more an Italian architect.

01:06:40.665 --> 01:06:41.749
Well...

01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:51.008
No, it's not true. It's a joke.

01:06:52.093 --> 01:06:53.427
No, these are my own.

01:06:57.515 --> 01:07:01.018
So you're friends with Tiriac?
Just friends?

01:07:01.686 --> 01:07:03.521
Has no friends. No.

01:07:03.688 --> 01:07:07.608
I'm a tennis partner.
We play tennis together in Germany.

01:07:07.775 --> 01:07:09.610
Wow, that's cool. That's interesting.

01:07:09.777 --> 01:07:12.530
Yes, but now he doesn't answer
the phone.

01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:16.409
No, because he has a crisis.

01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:20.121
His <i>Schildkröte</i> died.

01:07:20.996 --> 01:07:23.207
Sorry, what's a <i>Schil</i>—? <i>Schil</i>...?

01:07:24.959 --> 01:07:26.544
It's a turtle.

01:07:26.711 --> 01:07:29.880
Oh, yes, yeah, yes.
The turtle was very, very old.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:33.801
They lived together for 45 years.

01:07:34.969 --> 01:07:36.804
And now, suddenly, then he:

01:07:37.221 --> 01:07:39.348
He's completely down.

01:07:39.849 --> 01:07:41.475
Heart attack.

01:07:45.563 --> 01:07:47.148
It's very sad, isn't it?

01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:49.734
Oh, that's really sad, I feel sorry.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.236
I'm sorry I have to laugh,
but I feel so sorry for him.

01:07:52.403 --> 01:07:54.530
For me, it's just a turtle, huh?

01:07:57.324 --> 01:07:58.701
Can I ask...?

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:01.996
What's your profession?

01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:03.998
What's my what?

01:08:04.165 --> 01:08:05.207
What's your...?

01:08:05.374 --> 01:08:06.584
Your profession.

01:08:07.835 --> 01:08:10.463
My profession is I'm a businessman.

01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:13.632
Businessman.
I'm a consultant and coach.

01:08:14.633 --> 01:08:16.051
That's great.

01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:17.845
And what's your focus, then?

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.263
Pardon?

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.350
You say you're into coaching.
What is your focus?

01:08:25.728 --> 01:08:26.854
Life.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.564
- Have you finished your dinner, sir?
- Pardon?

01:08:29.732 --> 01:08:32.484
So my Hummer is waiting.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:36.363
- Do you want to sit together?
- Yes, please.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.115
No. Thank you.

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:41.702
- So your table is free too. Please.
- Finally?

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:43.578
It was nice meeting you, Toni.

01:09:03.057 --> 01:09:04.308
Sorry.

01:09:05.893 --> 01:09:07.310
What was that?

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:09.270
Oh, the teeth.

01:09:09.438 --> 01:09:11.899
No, but the thing with the turtle.

01:09:13.442 --> 01:09:18.488
Yeah, I know, but— Well, you know,
some turtles, I think they live really long.

01:09:18.948 --> 01:09:20.407
Would you like something to drink?

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.078
Yes, please.
A bottle of sparkling water?

01:09:25.246 --> 01:09:26.997
Sparkling water, please.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:45.432
Oh, God, that's disgusting.

01:09:47.852 --> 01:09:50.104
He's definitely not waiting for Ion Tiriac.

01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:55.067
Well, you never know.

01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:56.735
The limo is waiting?

01:10:06.579 --> 01:10:09.623
- You had the carpaccio?
- Yeah. I've had that.

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:11.458
With the octopus. Is it good?

01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:13.836
It's... No, not really.

01:10:14.003 --> 01:10:15.087
Let's go!

01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:16.797
I've had it better.

01:10:18.716 --> 01:10:21.051
Oh, risotto. I'm gonna go for that.

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:23.470
My limousine is waiting.

01:10:26.557 --> 01:10:28.559
Very nice to meet you.

01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:30.853
Sorry, just one moment.

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.814
My husband has
a headhunting company here.

01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:37.651
If there's anything we can do to help you
or Mr. Tiriac, we'd be very happy to.

01:10:37.818 --> 01:10:39.570
Oh, that's for me?

01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:43.991
Good night!

01:10:45.409 --> 01:10:48.412
- You're a real pro.
- Yeah, well, he didn't even have a card.

01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:52.833
Excuse me.

01:10:54.919 --> 01:10:59.089
Gabriel just texted. "Tiriac. Cool."
I didn't get his card.

01:11:39.588 --> 01:11:43.467
The speaking went well.
I have no needs there anymore.

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:49.723
I made good use of the space.
I was there before.

01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:53.769
<i>And how was your breathing?</i>

01:11:53.936 --> 01:11:55.145
Breathing?

01:11:55.896 --> 01:11:59.149
<i>- Did you try out the technique?</i>
- No, I didn't need it this time.

01:12:00.109 --> 01:12:02.277
That went well. But I...

01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:05.906
...would like to work
on my body language.

01:12:06.073 --> 01:12:07.992
It slips away sometimes.

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:10.285
<i>Do you have a concrete example?</i>

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.916
It's more often while I'm listening.

01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:20.004
<i>- I suspect you're really listening.</i>
- Yes, sure.

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:24.008
<i>That's noble,
but focus on your own message.</i>

01:12:25.426 --> 01:12:27.219
Sure, I understand.

01:12:30.639 --> 01:12:32.474
- Sorry, may I interrupt?
- Sure.

01:12:34.643 --> 01:12:37.646
I have the feeling
the team isn't so tight anymore.

01:12:37.813 --> 01:12:39.189
Tim thinks the same.

01:12:39.356 --> 01:12:44.278
Do something for the team spirit to prevent
a gap between the Romanians and us.

01:12:44.445 --> 01:12:46.739
They've somehow lost their morale.

01:12:47.823 --> 01:12:49.491
I think so too.

01:12:49.658 --> 01:12:51.618
That's in line with my feeling.

01:12:52.661 --> 01:12:56.123
I'm doing a brunch for my birthday.
I'll invite everyone.

01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:59.251
Something personal. Good, good.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:08.802
We'll work with the numbers we have
and won't make a fuss.

01:13:09.762 --> 01:13:13.474
Your idea to build up pressure
through Dascalu backfired.

01:13:13.974 --> 01:13:17.144
Our project won't be a topic
between him and Iliescu.

01:13:18.145 --> 01:13:19.271
Why not?

01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:22.566
Dascalu trusts Iliescu
and sees no need to act.

01:13:22.733 --> 01:13:24.735
Mom, I have to work.

01:13:24.902 --> 01:13:28.489
And Henneberg wants to keep Dascalu
out of it so he can talk to the unions.

01:13:28.655 --> 01:13:30.157
Yes, I did.

01:13:31.658 --> 01:13:34.828
So how should I go on? I mean...

01:13:35.162 --> 01:13:40.459
The transport data was all wrong.
You can't cut enough staff there.

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:45.339
Sure. The good news is:
Henneberg wants you to do the radical cut.

01:13:45.672 --> 01:13:47.216
I'm eating fruit, yes.

01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:52.346
But that had no basis.
You know it was just speculation.

01:13:52.513 --> 01:13:57.017
And to sell such a big restructuring,
I need even more details from Iliescu.

01:13:58.352 --> 01:14:01.688
This will annoy the feminist in you...

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:05.109
...but Henneberg said
Ms. Conradi has enough charm...

01:14:05.275 --> 01:14:07.027
...to manage Iliescu by herself.

01:14:08.695 --> 01:14:12.491
I'm not a feminist or I wouldn't tolerate
guys like you, Gerald.

01:14:14.034 --> 01:14:16.036
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:14:16.203 --> 01:14:18.872
But Henneberg really believes in you.

01:14:19.039 --> 01:14:21.375
He wants to keep you here.

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:25.838
- What did you say?
- What I said? That I'd talk to you.

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:29.800
But that I'm sure you'll finish the project.

01:14:30.968 --> 01:14:34.596
- And our deal?
- Our deal. Always this deal.

01:14:34.763 --> 01:14:39.059
We're talking one year max
and you'll start from a whole new level.

01:14:43.021 --> 01:14:45.315
I've heard that a few times before.

01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:48.110
I can manage Bucharest from Shanghai.

01:14:48.277 --> 01:14:49.903
That's not realistic.

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:52.281
This here is your partner case.

01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:01.456
Did he just fart?

01:15:04.877 --> 01:15:06.295
So think about it.

01:15:06.753 --> 01:15:08.922
You can go anywhere afterwards.

01:15:09.089 --> 01:15:12.009
But first we finish this project.

01:15:13.844 --> 01:15:16.346
Can we continue somewhere else?

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:19.099
- I need a decision.
- Sure. Absolutely.

01:15:19.266 --> 01:15:21.935
I'll think about it. I'd like a coffee now.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:26.273
I was just wondering where we met.

01:15:27.399 --> 01:15:28.984
Excuse me?

01:15:29.151 --> 01:15:33.447
- What are you doing here?
- Working. We have a meeting now.

01:15:33.614 --> 01:15:37.201
Me too. I have a supervision
with Mr. Henneberg.

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:41.038
I hope he's not so stubborn today.

01:15:41.788 --> 01:15:43.874
Marburger. Also from Morrisons.

01:15:44.041 --> 01:15:45.500
Erdmann.

01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:47.002
Is that hand lotion?

01:15:47.878 --> 01:15:49.796
No, that was probably me.

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:54.509
Mr. Erdmann is a freelance coach.

01:15:54.927 --> 01:15:57.471
I'll contact you about the workshop.

01:15:57.638 --> 01:15:59.806
A workshop. For us or...?

01:15:59.973 --> 01:16:02.309
Yes, the idea was in the air.

01:16:03.185 --> 01:16:05.479
We will see. If you're "villing."

01:16:05.979 --> 01:16:07.147
Pardon?

01:16:07.314 --> 01:16:08.482
Villing?

01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:10.859
Are you villing?

01:16:12.069 --> 01:16:13.737
Forget it.

01:16:14.112 --> 01:16:15.197
Fine.

01:16:15.364 --> 01:16:17.157
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:16:17.616 --> 01:16:18.742
Goodbye.

01:16:32.214 --> 01:16:33.340
Sorry.

01:16:33.507 --> 01:16:34.841
I'll be right back.

01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:36.218
Yeah, of course.

01:16:44.643 --> 01:16:45.852
Are you insane?

01:16:48.939 --> 01:16:51.233
You want to ruin me or what?

01:16:53.026 --> 01:16:54.945
Dad, I'm talking to you.

01:16:59.366 --> 01:17:03.120
If this is about your father,
I'm not the right man...

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:07.874
...but if you want to work
on your charisma...

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:11.795
...or if you notice
you're talking to no one on the phone...

01:17:12.254 --> 01:17:15.048
...you're welcome to contact me.
Anytime.

01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:20.095
There's my man.

01:17:23.598 --> 01:17:25.100
That's fine, that's good.

01:17:25.267 --> 01:17:27.227
Please, come, let's go.

01:18:04.598 --> 01:18:07.267
No way I'm taking an electric car.
Forget it.

01:18:11.063 --> 01:18:13.106
Great. Looking forward to it.

01:18:13.774 --> 01:18:17.110
We might need two, right?

01:18:19.446 --> 01:18:22.115
I can deal with that. No problem.

01:18:25.494 --> 01:18:28.955
You sure about the two-masted boat?
It'll be really hard work.

01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:30.999
For five of us?

01:18:31.166 --> 01:18:35.087
You can forget Daniel.
He'll be in the bar, making drinks.

01:18:37.964 --> 01:18:40.050
Just send me a few pics.

01:18:40.217 --> 01:18:41.301
Great.

01:18:41.468 --> 01:18:42.761
I'll call you.

01:18:42.928 --> 01:18:44.596
Goodbye, my friend.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.111
It'll be such a stupid sailing trip.
They want a dual-mast.

01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:01.029
Why?

01:19:04.825 --> 01:19:07.244
So the maid hasn't come yet?

01:19:08.286 --> 01:19:11.498
Only Bogdan! Romanian lover for you!

01:19:38.358 --> 01:19:40.193
Can you sign this, please?

01:19:50.078 --> 01:19:51.329
Thank you very much.

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:52.664
Enjoy.

01:20:03.717 --> 01:20:05.010
Great.

01:20:06.553 --> 01:20:09.181
Gerald found out about us, by the way.

01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:12.309
So what?

01:20:12.476 --> 01:20:15.854
He said not to fuck you too much
so you don't lose your bite.

01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:20.150
I said, but that's why I fuck you.

01:20:23.695 --> 01:20:27.240
I want to fuck you
in every corner of this room today.

01:20:35.248 --> 01:20:36.708
What's wrong?

01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:39.878
I have to catch up. I'd rather watch first.

01:20:42.422 --> 01:20:44.257
Hurry up, then.

01:20:56.561 --> 01:20:58.939
I don't want to lose my bite.

01:21:01.525 --> 01:21:03.443
Don't be so humorless.

01:21:04.444 --> 01:21:06.363
I'll fuck you strong.

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:09.699
My sperm has superpowers.

01:21:13.161 --> 01:21:14.579
Come on, now.

01:21:17.541 --> 01:21:21.127
No, my bite is really more important.
I'll just watch.

01:21:42.899 --> 01:21:45.819
I want you to hit one of the petit fours.

01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:56.162
I'll eat it afterwards.

01:22:01.001 --> 01:22:02.711
You're serious?

01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:24.774
Which one?

01:22:26.735 --> 01:22:28.445
Whichever you like.

01:22:31.448 --> 01:22:32.532
Green.

01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:43.460
Fuck.

01:22:45.045 --> 01:22:46.671
I'm cumming.

01:22:59.559 --> 01:23:01.227
You're so stupid.

01:24:09.754 --> 01:24:11.464
Hi, Steph. It's Ines.

01:24:11.631 --> 01:24:14.467
Yeah, I know you're really busy.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

01:24:14.634 --> 01:24:18.221
I just wanted to tell you
that I got the number of the Tiriac coach.

01:24:18.847 --> 01:24:20.765
Yes, I met him again.

01:24:22.809 --> 01:24:24.769
Well, no, it's up to you, of course.

01:24:27.647 --> 01:24:29.941
Yeah, but why not? You know.

01:24:33.445 --> 01:24:35.655
I'm already getting dressed, yes.

01:24:35.989 --> 01:24:38.158
So I'll text you and then...

01:24:38.908 --> 01:24:41.327
Great! Okay. See you.

01:24:43.872 --> 01:24:45.248
Look at this.

01:24:45.415 --> 01:24:47.125
Gerald's lady.

01:24:47.792 --> 01:24:49.794
What a mama!

01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.797
He puts barbecue pictures online.

01:25:05.977 --> 01:25:07.645
Hi, Gabriel.

01:25:30.168 --> 01:25:32.045
Good evening, Mr. Erdmann.

01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:40.345
Have you calmed down a bit?

01:25:43.306 --> 01:25:45.016
Is Tiriac still coming?

01:25:47.727 --> 01:25:49.312
He said he was, yes.

01:25:51.856 --> 01:25:54.067
But today was the funeral.

01:25:55.318 --> 01:25:57.195
Of Angelina.

01:25:57.695 --> 01:25:59.572
- The turtle, yes.
- Exactly.

01:25:59.739 --> 01:26:03.117
- Did a lot of turtles attend?
- Yes, masses of them.

01:26:03.284 --> 01:26:05.787
Turtle band was there too.

01:26:05.954 --> 01:26:08.039
Am I supposed to...

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:11.251
...do anything particular here?

01:26:13.169 --> 01:26:15.046
- Want a drink?
- Yes, sure.

01:26:19.092 --> 01:26:20.468
Who's that guy?

01:26:20.969 --> 01:26:22.512
A colleague.

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:27.684
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:26:29.602 --> 01:26:31.604
Tim Trauter, Mr. Erdmann.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.898
Erdmann, nice to...

01:26:34.774 --> 01:26:36.234
Everything okay?

01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:38.278
Sorry.

01:26:39.904 --> 01:26:41.865
- Friends, right?
- Sure.

01:26:44.367 --> 01:26:47.036
What do your parents do? For a living.

01:26:48.246 --> 01:26:49.789
- My parents?
- Yes.

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:53.918
We have a car dealership.

01:26:54.085 --> 01:26:57.005
- BMWs.
- Terrific, yes.

01:26:57.630 --> 01:27:00.466
You can learn a lot from parents,
I have to say.

01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:03.094
I learned from my father, for example...

01:27:03.803 --> 01:27:05.471
...how to use a cheese grater.

01:27:08.308 --> 01:27:12.395
We pass this down
from generation to generation.

01:27:13.062 --> 01:27:14.898
Is it a special cheese grater?

01:27:15.815 --> 01:27:17.066
No...

01:27:17.233 --> 01:27:20.194
...just an ordinary, little cheese grater.

01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:24.574
Don't believe me, then.

01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:27.744
And you?

01:27:28.661 --> 01:27:30.580
Do you like grating cheese?

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:33.291
I don't have the time.

01:27:34.792 --> 01:27:38.671
You have to be incredibly relaxed
to handle a cheese grater right.

01:27:40.423 --> 01:27:44.719
- What a show they're putting on here.
- Yeah, no expenses spared.

01:27:44.886 --> 01:27:46.804
This is Dana.

01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:48.681
Tim, nice to meet you.

01:27:48.848 --> 01:27:51.017
- And...
- Erdmann. Hello.

01:27:51.809 --> 01:27:53.686
You're here too.

01:27:53.853 --> 01:27:57.273
- Is Henneberg here?
- Yeah, sure. We just had dinner.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.359
He must still be...

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:09.869
I'm incognito today.
We'll speak tomorrow.

01:28:10.036 --> 01:28:12.038
You must meet my husband.

01:28:12.205 --> 01:28:13.581
I have to phone my mother.

01:28:13.748 --> 01:28:17.669
- Henne lets a guy like that coach him?
- Funny, isn't it?

01:28:23.967 --> 01:28:25.635
Let me hold your plate.

01:28:30.598 --> 01:28:31.724
Car party?

01:28:32.642 --> 01:28:33.977
Absolutely.

01:28:34.352 --> 01:28:35.395
Later.

01:28:35.895 --> 01:28:37.397
I'll join in a minute.

01:28:41.651 --> 01:28:42.694
Let's do it.

01:28:50.618 --> 01:28:54.414
I tell you, I'm one of the best egg painters
in my country.

01:28:56.249 --> 01:28:57.333
Nice.

01:29:00.712 --> 01:29:04.007
I just learned a bit
about Romanian traditions.

01:29:05.925 --> 01:29:09.929
Mr. Erdmann, we're going to the club
and would love you to join us.

01:29:11.931 --> 01:29:14.434
In which embassy do you work for?

01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:17.270
Translation, please.

01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:19.814
In which embassy you work.

01:29:19.981 --> 01:29:21.482
The German one.

01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:22.984
In the German, yes.

01:29:23.151 --> 01:29:27.113
I am Ambassador Erdmann.
Yes, and this is my...

01:29:27.572 --> 01:29:30.158
...secretary, Ms. Schnuck.

01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:39.959
Thank you.

01:30:00.813 --> 01:30:03.274
- What's with that guy?
- Just fun.

01:30:06.986 --> 01:30:08.738
- It's him.
- Hello, Tatjana.

01:30:11.949 --> 01:30:13.284
Oh, is it okay?

01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:20.625
Welcome. I saw you
in the restaurant thing. Great.

01:30:20.792 --> 01:30:21.918
You know each other?

01:30:22.085 --> 01:30:24.545
Yeah, we met once.

01:30:24.712 --> 01:30:25.922
Yeah, great.

01:30:57.245 --> 01:30:58.371
No...

01:30:58.538 --> 01:31:00.248
...my heart...

01:31:00.832 --> 01:31:02.041
Thanks.

01:32:05.938 --> 01:32:07.106
I pay that.

01:32:09.066 --> 01:32:10.610
With a credit card?

01:37:16.248 --> 01:37:17.583
Please.

01:37:17.875 --> 01:37:19.084
From this...

01:38:44.336 --> 01:38:45.421
Don't be scared.

01:38:47.965 --> 01:38:50.718
Sorry, I was just checking in on you.

01:38:50.884 --> 01:38:53.345
Man, have you gone insane?

01:39:33.385 --> 01:39:34.720
Ms. Schnuck...

01:39:36.889 --> 01:39:38.390
...I have to arrest you...

01:39:40.476 --> 01:39:42.019
...because of drugs.

01:39:55.199 --> 01:39:57.326
And now unlock them, please.

01:39:58.202 --> 01:40:00.537
No, no, I can't risk that.

01:40:24.436 --> 01:40:26.438
Where did I put the key?

01:40:28.357 --> 01:40:31.694
Unlock them, I have an appointment.
I'm getting picked up.

01:40:33.362 --> 01:40:34.863
I don't have it.

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.783
I don't have it.

01:40:54.967 --> 01:40:57.261
I'm sorry, Bogdan.
My father made a stupid joke.

01:40:57.428 --> 01:40:59.263
We have to solve this problem.

01:42:32.564 --> 01:42:34.358
You can wake her up now.

01:43:02.678 --> 01:43:05.013
Come on. And take that thing off.

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:07.224
- What?
- Take it off!

01:43:19.611 --> 01:43:21.530
- Take a seat.
- Thank you very much.

01:43:21.697 --> 01:43:22.698
Please.

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:42.759
- Would you like a coffee?
- No, thank you. Not for me.

01:43:43.635 --> 01:43:45.178
- Good morning!
- Morning.

01:43:45.345 --> 01:43:47.681
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Yes, I'm fine. You?

01:43:47.848 --> 01:43:48.974
I'm fine, yeah.

01:43:49.141 --> 01:43:50.767
Mr. Erdmann, Mr. Iliescu.

01:43:50.934 --> 01:43:52.936
Iliescu. Nice to meet you.

01:43:54.730 --> 01:43:56.565
Thank you so much for taking your time.

01:43:56.732 --> 01:43:59.234
I'm sorry for not getting in touch
with you earlier.

01:43:59.401 --> 01:44:01.278
Mr. Erdmann just joined NWG.

01:44:01.445 --> 01:44:03.822
And as he is on a visit
with Mr. Henneberg...

01:44:03.989 --> 01:44:08.327
...he wants to take the opportunity to get
a personal impression of our project.

01:44:09.786 --> 01:44:11.580
So please have a seat.

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.085
How can I help you?

01:44:17.377 --> 01:44:18.629
Well...

01:44:19.922 --> 01:44:22.007
...Mr. Erdmann implemented
a similar project...

01:44:22.174 --> 01:44:24.468
...in one of the major
Russian oil companies recently.

01:44:24.635 --> 01:44:28.138
And today he just wants to listen
and get an impression...

01:44:28.305 --> 01:44:30.599
...of how we work together on this project.

01:44:37.522 --> 01:44:39.650
Oh, do you mind giving me a pen?

01:44:39.816 --> 01:44:41.944
I'm sorry, I'm not so well-prepared.

01:44:45.656 --> 01:44:49.826
First of all, I am looking forward
that the project is going to continue.

01:44:49.993 --> 01:44:51.286
So am I.

01:44:51.703 --> 01:44:55.290
And that we will work closer together
than we did so far.

01:44:55.457 --> 01:44:57.209
- Which is a pleasure.
- Yes, it is.

01:45:01.213 --> 01:45:06.218
As you know, I presented your figures
in our last steering committee.

01:45:07.928 --> 01:45:12.808
Unfortunately, a lot of questions came up
about some of the data you provided.

01:45:14.059 --> 01:45:16.561
So I defended your work since I know...

01:45:16.728 --> 01:45:20.065
...that the things we ask you
to deliver are complicated and—

01:45:20.232 --> 01:45:22.275
I'm surprised to hear there are problems.

01:45:22.442 --> 01:45:24.361
Mr. Tamaric is in Bucharest today.

01:45:24.528 --> 01:45:26.405
I know, I know, but it doesn't matter.

01:45:26.571 --> 01:45:29.032
I wanted to talk to you, personally,
of course.

01:45:30.492 --> 01:45:32.452
It's a complicated business case
we have here.

01:45:32.619 --> 01:45:34.371
And because of that,
we have to decide...

01:45:34.538 --> 01:45:37.582
...if you have the capacity
to work closer with us.

01:45:38.083 --> 01:45:43.005
As you know, it's very risky.
You could easily lose a lot of your workers.

01:45:44.214 --> 01:45:49.553
Or, if you prefer, we could send some of
our consultants to work here in your office.

01:45:51.346 --> 01:45:53.849
I don't think that is necessary.

01:45:58.937 --> 01:46:01.982
I also prefer to try it this way,
Mr. Erdmann.

01:46:07.195 --> 01:46:08.989
If you say so.

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.288
I'm sorry.

01:46:20.167 --> 01:46:21.793
It's strange. I'm really sorry.

01:47:11.468 --> 01:47:14.346
It's the last of the drill holes
that we will close.

01:47:14.513 --> 01:47:17.265
Hope to finish it
by the end of the week.

01:47:24.856 --> 01:47:27.067
We use an artificial lift system.

01:47:57.139 --> 01:47:58.223
That is not good.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.728
But this is really not good here.

01:48:20.829 --> 01:48:22.289
He knows our security standards.

01:48:22.622 --> 01:48:23.915
Please don't fire him.

01:48:24.082 --> 01:48:25.208
I will. I will.

01:48:25.375 --> 01:48:27.043
No, I said don't fire him!

01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:28.503
But I will!

01:48:46.271 --> 01:48:49.649
Hey, can you tell him not to fire that guy?

01:48:49.816 --> 01:48:52.152
He can fire who he wants.

01:48:52.319 --> 01:48:55.739
And the more he fires,
the fewer I have to fire.

01:49:03.622 --> 01:49:04.706
Listen, listen.

01:49:04.873 --> 01:49:06.499
That was just a joke.

01:49:06.666 --> 01:49:09.586
But you're right. He knows
our security standards. Please.

01:49:26.603 --> 01:49:27.812
No, thank you!

01:49:27.979 --> 01:49:29.439
Really good!

01:50:00.845 --> 01:50:02.180
I'm sorry.

01:51:40.612 --> 01:51:43.448
I said that we are going
to modernize everything here.

01:51:53.291 --> 01:51:54.459
Please.

01:52:00.131 --> 01:52:01.883
I have only euro.

01:52:12.143 --> 01:52:13.937
That's nice. Thank you.

01:52:15.605 --> 01:52:19.067
Don't lose the humor.

01:52:19.567 --> 01:52:20.985
Translate, please.

01:52:24.656 --> 01:52:25.824
I translated.

01:52:36.501 --> 01:52:40.171
I couldn't believe you told them
not to lose their humor.

01:52:40.964 --> 01:52:42.507
That's really bitter.

01:52:47.887 --> 01:52:49.681
It wasn't about that.

01:52:52.684 --> 01:52:54.769
It was a nice encounter.

01:52:57.522 --> 01:52:59.232
How can we modernize...

01:52:59.399 --> 01:53:03.194
...if you pee your pants
when only one of them is fired?

01:53:05.196 --> 01:53:07.490
Take a short break, please.

01:53:13.037 --> 01:53:18.376
In every step you make I can tell you
your economic connection to these people.

01:53:18.543 --> 01:53:21.045
Your "green" attitude won't help you.

01:53:22.464 --> 01:53:23.715
Sure.

01:53:28.052 --> 01:53:30.430
You're doing everything just great.

01:53:30.805 --> 01:53:32.182
Fantastic.

01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.404
It's here.

01:53:57.457 --> 01:53:58.666
Shall I drive her home?

01:54:00.001 --> 01:54:01.127
Yes, please.

01:54:32.116 --> 01:54:33.535
What's here?

01:54:34.619 --> 01:54:35.870
Toni.

01:54:37.288 --> 01:54:38.790
Ambassador Erdmann.

01:54:38.957 --> 01:54:40.291
Your apples!

01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:43.044
Oh, thanks.

01:54:43.211 --> 01:54:44.420
Should I stay?

01:54:46.506 --> 01:54:47.799
Just a moment.

01:55:04.774 --> 01:55:06.484
Let's stop now, Dad.

01:55:17.161 --> 01:55:20.164
Hello, Erdmann.
My secretary, Ms. Schnuck.

01:55:20.331 --> 01:55:21.666
Flavia!

01:55:24.043 --> 01:55:25.587
Please, let's go.

01:55:34.178 --> 01:55:35.513
You really came.

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:37.599
Spontaneous decision.

01:55:38.683 --> 01:55:40.852
But only if we don't make problems?

01:55:41.352 --> 01:55:42.604
Sorry for my sister.

01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:45.523
Yes, this is Ms. Schnuck, my secretary.

01:55:46.024 --> 01:55:47.191
You already know her.

01:55:47.358 --> 01:55:48.526
Yes, of course.

01:55:48.693 --> 01:55:53.239
And these are apples
from embassy's garden.

01:55:55.199 --> 01:55:56.534
Come in, please!

01:55:56.701 --> 01:56:01.205
You know, I had a vision of the painting
on the Easter eggs.

01:56:01.372 --> 01:56:02.874
Oh, the eggs!

01:56:05.627 --> 01:56:06.919
Please come in.

01:56:07.253 --> 01:56:09.380
These are friends, family, and...

01:56:10.715 --> 01:56:11.799
Ana!

01:56:14.719 --> 01:56:18.723
You remember Mr. Erdmann
from the party.

01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:20.058
You remember him?

01:56:20.224 --> 01:56:22.310
Yes, good to see you again.

01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:25.313
Oh, the eggs!

01:56:26.147 --> 01:56:27.315
You know...

01:56:28.733 --> 01:56:30.401
...these are the professional.

01:56:31.527 --> 01:56:33.529
We didn't really paint them.

01:56:33.696 --> 01:56:35.531
It's very complicated.

01:56:36.949 --> 01:56:39.619
But we did it with the children.

01:56:40.244 --> 01:56:41.913
We can show you, if you want.

01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:43.539
Please come in.

01:56:43.956 --> 01:56:45.917
- Ms. Schnuck, come.
- Come in.

01:56:47.585 --> 01:56:48.586
Please.

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.004
Dorina?

01:57:02.975 --> 01:57:04.477
She's my sister.

01:57:04.644 --> 01:57:06.145
She will explain to you.

01:57:11.442 --> 01:57:12.443
Please.

01:57:13.277 --> 01:57:14.779
Shall I help in the kitchen?

01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:17.407
It's for the colors.

01:57:17.573 --> 01:57:19.701
I thought you want to try.

01:57:19.867 --> 01:57:20.952
Yes, I'd love to.

01:57:21.119 --> 01:57:24.497
You have a seat.
And I bring the coffee. Just a moment.

01:57:24.664 --> 01:57:26.624
So please sit down, here.

01:57:26.791 --> 01:57:28.668
Yes. Thank you.

01:57:36.384 --> 01:57:38.302
We take this tool.

01:57:43.474 --> 01:57:46.310
And you put it in hot wax.

01:57:48.604 --> 01:57:50.148
Do you want some cake?

01:57:50.481 --> 01:57:52.150
Yes, would be nice.

01:57:53.985 --> 01:57:57.321
And you draw a pattern.
You draw a pattern.

01:58:00.241 --> 01:58:03.244
Ms. Schnuck, it's your turn.

01:58:03.828 --> 01:58:05.455
- Yes, you should try it.
- No.

01:58:05.621 --> 01:58:07.498
Go on. It's very...

01:58:07.665 --> 01:58:09.167
...healing.

01:58:11.502 --> 01:58:12.879
Well, sit down.

01:58:13.045 --> 01:58:15.047
And write some stuff down too, okay?

01:58:15.214 --> 01:58:16.758
A few notes.

01:58:28.394 --> 01:58:30.688
That's so nice, thank you. Sorry.

01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:32.940
I'll try, but this is too...

01:58:37.195 --> 01:58:38.696
This kind of...

01:58:38.863 --> 01:58:40.698
Thank you that we can be here.

01:58:42.784 --> 01:58:43.951
Cake is good.

01:58:44.368 --> 01:58:45.536
Thank you.

01:58:50.917 --> 01:58:53.461
Orthodox Easter is when?

01:58:54.921 --> 01:58:58.716
Next week,
but we come together before, usually.

01:59:00.384 --> 01:59:02.428
I will put it in the color bath.

01:59:08.434 --> 01:59:10.728
You have to keep it three to five minutes.

01:59:14.398 --> 01:59:17.735
It's a bit cold.
It will not be a good result, but...

01:59:17.902 --> 01:59:21.113
- We came just from the countryside.
- For fun?

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.698
Yes, we visited an oil field.

01:59:22.865 --> 01:59:23.908
Oh, really?

01:59:25.827 --> 01:59:27.203
This one worked.

01:59:27.703 --> 01:59:28.746
Oh, let him!

01:59:31.415 --> 01:59:33.751
I learn more and more
about your wild country.

01:59:33.918 --> 01:59:35.253
I think that's enough.

01:59:35.419 --> 01:59:36.587
Do you think it's wild?

01:59:36.754 --> 01:59:41.259
Thank you very much for your time
and your kindness.

01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:43.302
Sorry.

01:59:43.761 --> 01:59:44.971
A pleasure.

01:59:45.137 --> 01:59:47.265
I'll finish it. I'll bring it to you.

01:59:51.853 --> 01:59:52.937
I'm going now.

01:59:53.104 --> 01:59:55.064
I have to leave now.
Thank you very much.

01:59:55.231 --> 01:59:57.817
It was really interesting with the painting.

01:59:57.984 --> 02:00:00.611
Maybe we can sing a song for you...

02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:03.781
...and for your family?

02:00:03.948 --> 02:00:05.700
Just to say "thank you."

02:00:05.867 --> 02:00:08.452
Why not? Okay. It will be nice.

02:00:09.996 --> 02:00:12.039
I will arrange, here.

02:00:13.165 --> 02:00:16.794
Let's be polite for once
and bring this to an end.

02:00:26.554 --> 02:00:28.890
<i>Mon secrétaire</i> and I...

02:00:29.056 --> 02:00:32.310
...we will sing a song for you.

02:00:35.521 --> 02:00:38.900
Give an applause to the fabulous...

02:00:40.651 --> 02:00:42.028
...Whitney Schnuck!

02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:48.983
Goodbye.

02:04:55.906 --> 02:04:57.575
Is everything okay?

02:05:00.161 --> 02:05:02.121
You can play very well.

02:05:10.337 --> 02:05:11.755
What is this, here?

02:05:12.298 --> 02:05:14.675
It's a mask from Bulgaria.

02:05:16.427 --> 02:05:18.554
Do you want to stay for dinner?

02:05:19.096 --> 02:05:20.181
Or...?

02:05:20.347 --> 02:05:21.807
Yes, why not?

02:05:22.308 --> 02:05:24.935
Embassy is, <i>äh, sowieso,</i> closed now.

02:05:30.566 --> 02:05:33.277
You know I'm not
the German ambassador?

02:05:34.445 --> 02:05:36.697
I know the German ambassador.

02:05:39.283 --> 02:05:41.160
It's so stupid of me.

02:05:41.869 --> 02:05:43.370
I'm so sorry.

02:05:44.788 --> 02:05:46.457
All that was fun.

02:05:48.334 --> 02:05:50.377
Yes, I'm here for holidays.

02:05:52.213 --> 02:05:54.840
Visiting Ms. Schnuck.
She's my daughter.

02:05:59.637 --> 02:06:01.597
And I came to see...

02:06:02.097 --> 02:06:04.808
...how it is here and how she lives...

02:06:09.813 --> 02:06:11.857
...and it's very complicated.

02:06:12.650 --> 02:06:14.526
I know. Family.

02:06:21.909 --> 02:06:24.203
I'm so sorry. I mixed up the time.

02:06:24.370 --> 02:06:26.038
Oh, it's okay. I'm Lili.

02:06:27.665 --> 02:06:30.751
I hope it's okay that we started
bringing the stuff up?

02:06:30.918 --> 02:06:32.628
Of course. It's totally okay.

02:06:32.795 --> 02:06:33.963
I'm so sorry.

02:06:34.129 --> 02:06:35.172
No problem.

02:06:40.719 --> 02:06:43.639
We will bring the food tomorrow.

02:06:43.806 --> 02:06:46.558
So thank you very much
that you choose Darius Catering.

02:06:46.725 --> 02:06:48.644
No, thank you! It's great.

02:09:28.929 --> 02:09:30.472
Am I early?

02:09:31.432 --> 02:09:33.517
Come in. Come in.

02:09:39.815 --> 02:09:41.442
Thank you so much!

02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:43.152
That's nice.

02:09:52.995 --> 02:09:54.246
This is nice.

02:09:56.039 --> 02:09:58.542
Darius did a good job.

02:09:59.543 --> 02:10:02.754
Everybody was really nice.
I mean, it's a super-small event.

02:10:10.095 --> 02:10:11.555
So who else is coming?

02:10:13.223 --> 02:10:16.226
Basically, my team from the office.

02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:19.730
That's good. It's new people.

02:10:37.498 --> 02:10:38.624
Here you are.

02:10:43.670 --> 02:10:44.755
Like this?

02:10:46.006 --> 02:10:48.884
I'm kind of a last-minute girl too!

02:10:52.804 --> 02:10:55.807
Do you want me
to help you choose something?

02:10:55.974 --> 02:10:58.185
I mean, I bet your closet's bursting.

02:10:59.102 --> 02:11:00.354
No. Thank you.

02:11:08.362 --> 02:11:09.613
Shall I help?

02:11:16.495 --> 02:11:19.915
Shall I get that? I'll get the door,
and you get dressed, okay?

02:11:40.811 --> 02:11:44.064
Nothing's wrong, Gerald,
I just have nothing on.

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.609
It's a...

02:11:48.193 --> 02:11:49.861
...naked reception.

02:11:51.863 --> 02:11:53.699
Interesting, okay.

02:11:54.575 --> 02:11:56.827
For team building, because you...

02:11:56.994 --> 02:12:00.163
Stupid idea,
I couldn't think of anything better.

02:12:04.126 --> 02:12:06.461
You don't have to join in.

02:12:07.045 --> 02:12:09.298
Just ring if you change your mind.

02:12:11.466 --> 02:12:12.593
Thanks.

02:12:27.357 --> 02:12:28.650
Who was that?

02:12:30.027 --> 02:12:31.278
That was your boss.

02:12:39.703 --> 02:12:42.456
So, what are we gonna do
with you now?

02:12:49.338 --> 02:12:51.632
Well, I'm definitely
not getting undressed.

02:12:53.216 --> 02:12:54.885
It's not my deal, you know.

02:12:56.011 --> 02:12:57.888
Sorry, but then you have to go.

02:13:00.223 --> 02:13:01.266
Really?

02:13:34.174 --> 02:13:35.509
Have fun, you two.

02:13:42.182 --> 02:13:43.350
Am I early?

02:13:45.435 --> 02:13:46.603
It's a...

02:13:48.063 --> 02:13:50.065
It's a naked party.

02:13:54.653 --> 02:13:57.781
Gerald had the idea,
he got it from college...

02:13:57.948 --> 02:14:00.909
- For team building and stuff.
- Sure.

02:14:03.370 --> 02:14:05.205
And who's there?

02:14:05.539 --> 02:14:06.790
No one.

02:14:15.507 --> 02:14:20.178
I know they're all in there.
I'll come in naked, then funny and stuff.

02:14:23.849 --> 02:14:26.184
Call me when the fun's over.

02:14:29.604 --> 02:14:30.939
Thanks, Tim.

02:15:54.523 --> 02:15:58.276
Tim said you won't answer
unless we're naked.

02:16:04.199 --> 02:16:06.952
But it has nothing to do with sex, right?

02:16:07.118 --> 02:16:08.620
No, no, no.

02:16:09.538 --> 02:16:11.331
So just a challenge?

02:16:13.708 --> 02:16:14.709
Exactly.

02:16:17.379 --> 02:16:19.089
I brought this.

02:16:21.049 --> 02:16:22.926
Unfortunately, I couldn't...

02:16:24.094 --> 02:16:25.136
...wash that out.

02:16:26.763 --> 02:16:27.973
Thanks.

02:16:28.431 --> 02:16:30.350
It's totally fine. It's...

02:16:31.226 --> 02:16:32.477
Sure.

02:16:42.445 --> 02:16:43.487
Thanks.

02:16:46.491 --> 02:16:47.909
I'm sorry, I am...

02:16:53.957 --> 02:16:55.416
Am I the first?

02:17:09.263 --> 02:17:10.389
Happy birthday.

02:17:12.017 --> 02:17:13.143
Thanks.

02:17:23.861 --> 02:17:27.365
I just thought
because you always ask for mine...

02:17:28.450 --> 02:17:30.451
But it didn't cost much.

02:17:33.079 --> 02:17:34.748
Is everything okay?

02:17:41.004 --> 02:17:43.130
It's just that at work...

02:17:44.758 --> 02:17:46.927
...you're always so serious and now...

02:17:47.802 --> 02:17:49.679
...you come up with this idea.

02:17:57.646 --> 02:17:59.814
So do you like the apartment?

02:17:59.981 --> 02:18:01.273
Are you pleased?

02:18:02.233 --> 02:18:03.567
Why?

02:18:04.443 --> 02:18:06.821
I searched for it so long.

02:18:07.739 --> 02:18:08.949
Oh, yes.

02:18:09.115 --> 02:18:10.659
God, I didn't know that.

02:18:11.117 --> 02:18:12.118
Thanks.

02:18:12.535 --> 02:18:13.827
Sure.

02:18:20.543 --> 02:18:22.921
- So would you like a drink?
- Yes, please.

02:18:23.088 --> 02:18:24.839
- What?
- Perhaps...

02:19:01.876 --> 02:19:02.919
Tim?

02:19:08.799 --> 02:19:10.218
Who is that?

02:19:10.385 --> 02:19:11.803
I have no idea.

02:19:16.683 --> 02:19:18.518
It's not Gerald, is it?

02:19:20.602 --> 02:19:22.313
Are you Gerald?

02:19:52.135 --> 02:19:53.803
Had a beer first.

02:19:56.347 --> 02:19:57.390
Come in?

02:20:27.879 --> 02:20:29.089
Happy birthday.

02:20:42.769 --> 02:20:45.480
Hard-core. So hard-core.

02:20:46.022 --> 02:20:47.565
This is nuts.

02:20:54.322 --> 02:20:55.448
Hard-core.

02:21:01.871 --> 02:21:03.665
Where did you get that?

02:21:06.459 --> 02:21:07.794
It...

02:21:08.670 --> 02:21:10.463
I think it's Bulgarian.

02:21:11.089 --> 02:21:13.716
It's supposed to scare
the evil spirits away.

02:21:13.883 --> 02:21:15.009
Right.

02:21:15.176 --> 02:21:17.303
That's good for the team! I think.

02:21:22.684 --> 02:21:23.852
Hard-core.

02:21:40.785 --> 02:21:42.412
Is he leaving?

02:21:51.754 --> 02:21:53.715
So there's...

02:21:53.882 --> 02:21:57.051
...salmon with lemon remoulade
and stuff like that.

02:21:57.218 --> 02:21:59.429
Serve yourselves. I have to pay him.

02:22:06.311 --> 02:22:07.520
Hi! Come in.

02:22:08.104 --> 02:22:09.939
I'll be back in a second. I'm sorry.

02:22:10.106 --> 02:22:11.566
Please enjoy.

02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:14.485
Gerald and Anca are here as well.

02:22:14.652 --> 02:22:15.737
I'm sorry.

02:23:58.131 --> 02:23:59.299
Dad!

02:26:44.338 --> 02:26:45.506
Excuse me?

02:26:47.925 --> 02:26:49.343
Can you help me?

02:26:49.886 --> 02:26:51.179
With the head?

02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:54.599
Maybe...

02:26:56.934 --> 02:26:58.102
You pull.

02:27:00.438 --> 02:27:01.606
Like this?

02:27:02.815 --> 02:27:03.941
Pull!

02:27:04.942 --> 02:27:06.110
Strong.

02:27:12.325 --> 02:27:13.409
There you go.

02:27:16.746 --> 02:27:18.247
Everything okay?

02:28:28.693 --> 02:28:30.444
Serious occasion.

02:28:34.490 --> 02:28:36.325
- May I?
- Yes, thank you.

02:29:08.733 --> 02:29:11.235
I'm sorry I didn't see her again.

02:29:33.883 --> 02:29:35.843
The line is long.

02:29:36.636 --> 02:29:38.929
They still want money from her.

02:29:50.149 --> 02:29:52.026
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

02:29:54.236 --> 02:29:56.656
Close the coffin, then, please.

02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:46.288
Can I help with anything?

02:30:46.455 --> 02:30:48.457
It's almost done, thanks.

02:31:10.479 --> 02:31:13.232
If you see anything you like here...

02:31:13.858 --> 02:31:17.027
...anything you're attached to,
Benjamin's making a list.

02:31:17.945 --> 02:31:19.947
I'll think about it. Thanks.

02:31:27.246 --> 02:31:28.998
Go visit him. He'd love that.

02:31:29.498 --> 02:31:31.500
I will, spontaneously.

02:31:32.251 --> 02:31:33.335
Ines.

02:31:36.672 --> 02:31:39.049
Where are you these days? Budapest?

02:31:39.508 --> 02:31:41.135
Bucharest.

02:31:41.302 --> 02:31:44.472
But I just quit.
I'm going to Singapore for two years.

02:31:44.764 --> 02:31:46.182
New company.

02:31:47.016 --> 02:31:49.185
How are such companies called?

02:31:49.351 --> 02:31:53.355
Maybe you know the new one: McKinsey.
The old one was Morrisons.

02:31:53.522 --> 02:31:55.775
Great how you get around.

02:31:56.484 --> 02:31:58.652
Winfried, can you come here?

02:32:02.865 --> 02:32:04.867
And you're still in Málaga?

02:32:05.034 --> 02:32:08.204
No, we've been back
in Remchingen for a while.

02:32:11.665 --> 02:32:13.876
- I'll be back.
- See you.

02:32:32.895 --> 02:32:34.313
That song...

02:32:35.689 --> 02:32:37.566
...Irma's crazy, isn't she?

02:32:39.401 --> 02:32:43.531
They were supposed to play something
by Harry Belafonte.

02:32:45.366 --> 02:32:46.951
She liked him.

02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:50.246
Although it was "Negro music."

02:33:02.216 --> 02:33:03.425
You know...

02:33:10.766 --> 02:33:12.726
All the stuff she kept...

02:33:22.278 --> 02:33:23.445
Steel helmet.

02:33:29.618 --> 02:33:31.453
Full of hats, look.

02:33:47.636 --> 02:33:48.804
You know...

02:33:53.475 --> 02:33:56.103
...your question there, in Bucharest...

02:33:56.812 --> 02:33:58.272
...about life...

02:33:58.981 --> 02:34:01.275
...what I find worth living for.

02:34:04.653 --> 02:34:06.363
The problem is...

02:34:09.158 --> 02:34:12.494
...it's so often about getting things done.

02:34:12.828 --> 02:34:15.831
You have to do this or that,
but in the meanwhile...

02:34:16.707 --> 02:34:19.126
...life is just passing by.

02:34:23.672 --> 02:34:26.634
How are we supposed
to hang on to moments?

02:34:31.430 --> 02:34:34.141
Now I just sit sometimes
and remember...

02:34:35.726 --> 02:34:38.687
...how you learned to ride your bike...

02:34:40.856 --> 02:34:42.483
...how I...

02:34:43.067 --> 02:34:45.694
...once found you at a bus stop.

02:34:52.701 --> 02:34:55.704
But you only realize that afterwards...

02:34:59.166 --> 02:35:01.001
...in the moment itself...

02:35:02.878 --> 02:35:04.672
...it's not possible.

02:35:42.126 --> 02:35:43.544
Exactly.

02:35:49.883 --> 02:35:51.635
Wait there.

02:35:52.428 --> 02:35:54.388
I'll get my camera.

02:42:17.813 --> 02:42:19.815
