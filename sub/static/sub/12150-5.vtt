00:01.929 --> 00:02.870
Previously;

00:03.129 --> 00:06.459
- We're not friends anymore.
- I didn't kill your father...

00:07.330 --> 00:08.939
...so quit blaming me!

00:09.730 --> 00:13.240
We were impressed with your sacrifice.
We'll get even.

00:13.929 --> 00:17.829
- He killed me.
- He took from us. We'll pay him back.

00:18.129 --> 00:20.339
Why are you so good to me,
after what I did?

00:21.129 --> 00:23.300
Because you and I are one.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.689 --> 00:42.409
We made you some tea.

00:43.090 --> 00:44.140
Great.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.229
It's on the table in front of you.

00:52.090 --> 00:53.560
Table seems far.

00:53.890 --> 00:57.079
You must be tired from
sleeping the last three days.

00:58.090 --> 01:02.619
He's the world's oldest teenager. Can
he be having a growth spurt at 248?

01:03.490 --> 01:04.650
Two forty-seven.

01:07.090 --> 01:11.659
If we garner some paying clientele
soon, we're financially sound...

01:12.730 --> 01:16.239
- ...through last Wednesday.
- What? Where's it all going?

01:16.930 --> 01:21.040
There's the fixed costs: the mortgage
on the big hotel, my salary--

01:21.730 --> 01:23.480
My salary is fixed too.

01:23.530 --> 01:27.849
What if every time you identified
a demon in one of your old books...

01:28.930 --> 01:30.299
...we gave you 10 bucks?

01:30.730 --> 01:32.060
Or a chicken pot pie.

01:32.530 --> 01:35.340
I have another idea. No!
Get a vision.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.989
It doesn't happen
like a hit to the head.

01:38.530 --> 01:41.340
Let's test that theory
with one of my books!

01:42.129 --> 01:45.709
Stop arguing. Something will turn up.
It always does.

01:48.129 --> 01:49.180
Guys....

01:49.329 --> 01:50.409
Like that.

01:59.530 --> 02:00.609
Are you all right?

02:01.329 --> 02:03.930
- Want to sit?
- No, I'll throw up in my head.

02:04.329 --> 02:06.010
Did it look like this?

02:07.329 --> 02:10.419
No. More mushy and more moldy.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.319
It was growing right out of the wall.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.259
Maybe I'll just....

02:15.729 --> 02:19.520
Mush monster's not going anywhere.
We have to find the place.

02:20.530 --> 02:24.669
Its human disciples are killing
each other over how to worship it.

02:25.930 --> 02:28.909
This is why, personally,
I rarely go to church.

02:31.930 --> 02:33.370
I thought it was funny.

02:34.330 --> 02:36.009
So did I.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.080
God, I miss you.

02:48.729 --> 02:50.590
What did the place look like?

02:52.930 --> 02:55.879
I didn't doze off. Here I am.
Where were we?

02:56.530 --> 02:58.949
Ascertaining the place in her vision.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.860
- Ascertaining. Here we go.
- You are so weird lately.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.949
It felt sacred, in a twisted,
demonic kind of way.

03:08.530 --> 03:10.699
It's underground, like in a tank.

03:10.930 --> 03:12.860
- Full of pillars.
- A water tank?

03:13.330 --> 03:14.030
Could be.

03:14.530 --> 03:18.919
St. Bridget's in Fremont. A convent
built on native burial grounds.

03:19.930 --> 03:20.840
Land's cursed.

03:21.129 --> 03:23.759
Eight murders in two years.
Then it burnt up.

03:24.129 --> 03:27.289
Not as bad as what
happened at Our Lady of Lochenbee.

03:29.530 --> 03:31.560
I dig convents.
Anyway...

03:31.930 --> 03:34.099
...the state
dug a water tank there.

03:34.930 --> 03:37.909
We'll need help. Call Gunn.
He's on the payroll.

03:38.530 --> 03:41.580
But not like me.
He's more an outside contractor.

03:42.129 --> 03:43.500
- Can we really afford--?
- Wesley.

03:43.930 --> 03:45.229
Calling Gunn.

04:03.050 --> 04:05.330
You're not paying me enough for this.

04:10.849 --> 04:15.030
My Uncle Theo always said,
"Stay out of religious wars."

04:15.650 --> 04:18.670
- You have an uncle?
- No, but it's good advice.

04:19.850 --> 04:21.920
- Is it a Thrall demon?
- Yeah.

04:22.250 --> 04:25.899
Kill the Big Ugly, and the rest
will stop killing each other.

04:26.449 --> 04:30.240
Yes, that's the theory.
Thrall demons can be tricky.

04:33.050 --> 04:36.069
At least they're killing
each other and not...

04:36.649 --> 04:37.980
Intruders!

04:41.449 --> 04:42.430
...us!

05:04.850 --> 05:06.290
I'll get Fat Head!

05:07.850 --> 05:08.759
Watch my back!

05:11.449 --> 05:13.660
Or keep beating on that big guy.

05:33.649 --> 05:35.050
Angel, it's over!

05:35.449 --> 05:36.459
Stop!

05:43.850 --> 05:47.850
- Teamwork's a thing of the past now?
- The job got done.

05:49.250 --> 05:50.620
Take the car.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.209
I need to....

05:54.649 --> 05:58.089
He's just.... He hasn't been
sleeping well lately.

05:58.850 --> 06:01.829
- He's off his game.
- Since when is it a game?

08:05.250 --> 08:07.500
Thought we were meeting
in the square.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.990
I ran into Lord Nichols.
Horrid little man.

08:11.850 --> 08:15.040
He was dickering over price
with a prostitute.

08:16.050 --> 08:17.279
Can you imagine?

08:17.850 --> 08:20.829
- I told him I'd do him for free.
- Very charitable.

08:21.449 --> 08:23.660
I so loathe cheap royalty.

08:30.449 --> 08:34.700
- They all taste the same to me.
- My boy does have the touch.

08:35.850 --> 08:38.169
- Darla?
- Yes?

08:38.850 --> 08:41.169
Why did you kill the streetwalker?

08:43.049 --> 08:45.509
Oh, I just liked her.

08:46.649 --> 08:48.330
Guess what's next?

08:52.049 --> 08:55.529
- What is it?
- Surprise. You have to guess.

09:08.850 --> 09:10.179
The three daughters.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.730
- All virgins.
- Close.

09:16.649 --> 09:19.039
The middle one is delicate and unique.

09:19.649 --> 09:21.259
Did you find me a saint?

09:22.049 --> 09:24.679
Better than that. She has the sight.

09:30.450 --> 09:31.820
Visions.

09:32.850 --> 09:36.259
She sees the future.
She is pure innocence.

09:37.049 --> 09:40.419
She sees what's coming.
She knows what I'll do to her.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.899
I'll have to use care.

09:43.049 --> 09:46.419
Now you're learning. Down, boy.
Let the plum ripen.

09:50.850 --> 09:53.100
You always come up with new things.

09:53.850 --> 09:55.460
It keeps me young.

10:05.850 --> 10:09.679
Here you go, sir. Franks!
A dollar off! Franks! Franks!

10:11.250 --> 10:12.690
Dollar off with coupon.

10:13.049 --> 10:16.879
Hot dogs! Franks! A dollar off
with your coupon.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.789
I really need some help,

10:20.649 --> 10:22.370
They say he handles things.

10:22.450 --> 10:25.220
Unusual things.
I need to see him right away.

10:26.049 --> 10:29.669
He'd like that, soon as he returns
from an important case.

10:30.850 --> 10:33.659
I'll take a report
and give you a list...

10:33.850 --> 10:35.809
...of our payment plans.

10:38.049 --> 10:40.440
Well, it's my wife, Claire.

10:41.049 --> 10:43.009
She's really a lovely....

10:46.450 --> 10:48.169
Go on. It's all right.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.340
She gets abducted by aliens
on a regular basis.

10:56.049 --> 10:57.279
Aliens?

10:57.850 --> 11:00.480
- From outer space?
- It's quite common.

11:00.850 --> 11:03.100
One minute she's there,
and the next....

11:03.850 --> 11:06.169
She always comes back in a day or so.

11:06.850 --> 11:08.990
What is it you'd like us to do?

11:09.850 --> 11:11.320
I trust Claire.

11:11.649 --> 11:14.490
But I found this receipt
from a hotel...

11:15.250 --> 11:19.710
...two weeks ago, when she was
supposed to be in the Trifid Nebula.

11:21.250 --> 11:24.269
- We'll figure this out.
- If it's not aliens--

11:27.250 --> 11:28.409
Is that...?

11:29.049 --> 11:30.730
Meet your new best friend.

11:31.450 --> 11:33.870
- You think my wife's cheating?
- Probably.

11:34.450 --> 11:36.590
He likes you.
He's jumping right in.

11:36.850 --> 11:38.389
He didn't seem that--

11:38.649 --> 11:41.629
All the greats are eccentric.
Holmes, Marlowe....

11:42.250 --> 11:44.179
- Those are fictional--
- Right.

11:44.649 --> 11:46.090
That gives him a leg up.

11:46.450 --> 11:49.220
Terrific way to treat
our paying customers.

11:50.049 --> 11:52.610
Especially since we have
so many of them.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.620
See his file?

11:56.049 --> 11:59.139
He has Visa, MasterCard, a problem.

11:59.649 --> 12:02.809
Just what we need.
But if you want to be rude...

12:03.850 --> 12:05.429
...I guess it's your shop.

12:05.649 --> 12:08.389
Angel? What are you--?

12:09.250 --> 12:11.879
Personal bubble. Personal bubble!

12:12.250 --> 12:15.899
I need to speak with you.
Cordelia, you shouldn't be here.

12:17.049 --> 12:19.370
- Did I do something?
- He felt my hair.

12:19.450 --> 12:21.590
- What?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.009
Haven't been myself lately,
because of her.

12:25.450 --> 12:28.570
I saw her, here in town last night.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.539
Oh, no, not again. Look.

12:32.049 --> 12:33.980
I like Buffy as much as--

12:34.450 --> 12:35.919
Not Buffy. Darla.

12:37.450 --> 12:39.409
Darla the vampire? Your sire?

12:39.850 --> 12:43.570
Been dreaming about her like crazy.
The dreams have been so....

12:45.250 --> 12:48.799
I thought I was losing it.
But she's here. She's alive.

12:49.450 --> 12:52.399
Impossible. You killed her
3Â½ years ago.

12:53.049 --> 12:54.730
I know. But it was her.

12:55.450 --> 12:59.309
- Vampires don't return from death.
- I did. And I saw her.

12:59.649 --> 13:02.669
- Where?
- Between the clowns and a big hot dog.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.990
Walking on the promenade.

13:06.850 --> 13:09.340
You said you were having
dreams lately.

13:09.850 --> 13:11.850
Maybe guilt over killing
your sire.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.990
Right! Guilt. Who loves guilt
more than you?

13:15.250 --> 13:17.460
You need to go back to work.

13:18.250 --> 13:21.799
We have a fun new case.
Aliens, adultery, it's a corker.

13:23.049 --> 13:25.299
I dream about her because she's here.

13:25.450 --> 13:28.539
You think she's here
because you're dreaming.

13:33.850 --> 13:35.460
He's falling apart.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.080
That's wonderful.

13:38.649 --> 13:42.509
Unhinging a man with all his
strengths and weaknesses is tough.

13:43.450 --> 13:46.289
I created many of his
strengths and weaknesses.

13:47.049 --> 13:49.370
I have a pretty good handle on them.

13:50.649 --> 13:52.159
We're counting on that.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.649
You gave us invaluable
information on Angel.

13:56.649 --> 14:00.789
Nobody knows him like you. Especially
the side we're interested in.

14:02.649 --> 14:06.480
So, what is the plan exactly?
I tease him to death?

14:07.450 --> 14:09.519
We want him dark, not dead.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.809
And the best way to his darkness...

14:12.250 --> 14:15.340
...is to awaken his nastier urges.

14:18.850 --> 14:20.320
He did that to you?

14:21.250 --> 14:22.580
What's it feel like?

14:23.649 --> 14:25.440
Doesn't feel like anything.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.789
Can I?

14:35.049 --> 14:36.659
It's very smooth.

14:39.850 --> 14:41.289
You don't feel anything?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.779
Not in my hand.

14:50.049 --> 14:50.850
How is it...

14:52.450 --> 14:53.570
...seeing him again?

14:54.850 --> 14:56.039
Strange.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.580
He betrayed you.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.789
Everyone betrays you.

15:02.649 --> 15:04.820
That's not what eats at you.

15:05.049 --> 15:06.559
Yeah? What does?

15:07.450 --> 15:09.129
Missed opportunities.

15:09.850 --> 15:11.919
He got a soul and it sickened me.

15:12.250 --> 15:16.220
All that power wasted
on a whining, mopey do-gooder.

15:17.649 --> 15:19.470
God, I could eat his eyeballs.

15:20.649 --> 15:24.549
Our plans for Angel are more
long-term. But if you must, then...

15:25.450 --> 15:26.679
...be my guest.

15:27.850 --> 15:29.289
You're fun, for a human.

15:29.649 --> 15:31.860
I've a special interest
in this guy.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.330
Lots of people do.

15:40.009 --> 15:40.990
Jack.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.730
What brings you to Siberia?

15:45.409 --> 15:47.129
Hello, Kate.

15:47.809 --> 15:50.059
- You've been sick.
- No.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.600
Busy, then?

15:53.210 --> 15:55.419
Too busy to call and say hi?

15:58.009 --> 15:59.379
We were friends.

15:59.809 --> 16:02.549
- Thought you'd be different.
- I supported you.

16:03.409 --> 16:05.659
I objected when they transferred you.

16:05.809 --> 16:07.600
You don't like regular work.

16:08.210 --> 16:12.039
You got the scanner going
day and night, chasing the bizarre.

16:13.009 --> 16:15.039
Did you think they'd promote you?

16:17.809 --> 16:20.299
--working on 4O5 and Pico,

16:22.009 --> 16:25.129
A friend of a friend thought
you might want this.

16:37.009 --> 16:38.450
Thanks.

16:38.809 --> 16:40.700
Stay out of trouble.

16:55.009 --> 16:56.620
Now? You sure about this?

16:57.409 --> 16:59.940
Marty, aliens abduct me
when the mood hits.

17:01.009 --> 17:03.850
The mood hit as soon
as Harold left for work.

17:04.009 --> 17:05.170
No kidding? Yeah?

17:05.809 --> 17:07.980
- You're not in the mood?
- I'm in the mood,

17:08.210 --> 17:10.170
I'm deep in the mood,

17:11.210 --> 17:13.490
I'd love to abduct and probe you now.

17:13.608 --> 17:17.930
- But I still got lots of repairs,
- I hope nothing is broken,

17:19.009 --> 17:20.480
No, It all works,

17:20.809 --> 17:22.598
So let's go upstairs,

17:29.809 --> 17:30.819
Claire.

17:31.609 --> 17:32.769
Do I know you?

17:32.809 --> 17:35.579
I've been listening over there,
recording you...

17:36.410 --> 17:39.960
...while my associates
tailed you, taking pictures.

17:40.609 --> 17:42.119
I don't like doing this.

17:42.410 --> 17:46.980
Your husband knows. Tell him the
truth. Stay or leave, I don't care.

17:47.809 --> 17:48.609
But this....

17:55.009 --> 17:58.420
- We had a paying client!
- It wasn't worth getting paid for.

17:59.210 --> 18:01.980
Easy to say when you don't
need food to live.

18:04.009 --> 18:05.309
That's her.

18:07.609 --> 18:08.910
Oh, sorry.

18:09.410 --> 18:11.690
Guess you didn't stay dead, did you?

18:12.410 --> 18:14.970
- You trying to pass for a human?
- Excuse me.

18:15.410 --> 18:18.250
I know your voice, Darla.
I can smell you.

18:19.609 --> 18:21.569
I don't know you.
Leave me alone.

18:22.009 --> 18:25.099
- Whatever you're up to, you won't win.
- I don't think--

18:25.609 --> 18:28.559
- Is everything all right?
- No! This man was....

18:29.210 --> 18:32.650
My name is DeEtta Kramer.
My husband is getting the car.

18:33.410 --> 18:34.880
I don't know any Darla.

18:35.210 --> 18:37.839
It's you.
I know you won't step in that sun.

18:38.809 --> 18:40.180
Step over here--

18:40.609 --> 18:42.470
- Stephen! Stephen!
- Angel!

18:45.410 --> 18:46.599
Stephen!

18:49.009 --> 18:50.170
Are you okay?

18:59.650 --> 19:02.039
Guys, that was really fun.

19:02.650 --> 19:05.809
Public humiliation, running
from hotel security...

19:06.250 --> 19:09.509
...and the nifty outfit
telling so many conventioneers:

19:10.450 --> 19:12.269
"Pet me, I'm a whore."

19:12.849 --> 19:15.410
- There's a silver lining.
- Silver lining?

19:15.849 --> 19:19.710
The woman went in the sun. Obviously
she's not a vampire. Angel...

19:20.650 --> 19:22.369
- ...made a mistake.
- You think?

19:23.049 --> 19:26.910
We have to come together and help him.
You're among friends.

19:27.250 --> 19:31.430
- We won't condemn you.
- Right. You're crazy. You need help.

19:32.650 --> 19:37.039
It was Darla. She's back and she's
human now. I know her scent.

19:37.450 --> 19:40.430
Angel, you can't
just sniff a person and....

19:41.049 --> 19:43.680
- You had sex last night with a blond.
- How--?!

19:44.650 --> 19:47.460
That's unbelievable.
You had sex?

19:48.250 --> 19:50.049
- She's not in here.
- Who, Darla?

19:50.049 --> 19:52.400
DeEtta Kramer, the name she's using.

19:53.049 --> 19:55.650
Run a title deed search.
Find her address.

19:56.650 --> 19:58.650
- I'll try some other avenues.
- Okay.

20:02.049 --> 20:05.000
Wesley, I need a few bucks
for the cover charge.

20:05.650 --> 20:08.839
- Cover charge? You're going to--
- Do whatever it takes.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.880
Everybody have fun tonight

20:12.250 --> 20:15.089
Everybody wang-- Fun tonight

20:15.849 --> 20:18.480
Everybody wang chung tonight

20:19.450 --> 20:22.190
Everybody have fun tonight

20:23.049 --> 20:25.680
Everybody have fun tonight

20:27.849 --> 20:33.119
Everybody
Everybody have fun tonight

20:34.450 --> 20:37.329
Everybody

20:38.049 --> 20:40.509
Everybody have fun tonight

20:41.049 --> 20:43.400
Everybody

20:45.849 --> 20:47.740
I'm very sorry.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.380
Tell me about Darla.

20:51.849 --> 20:52.900
Give me a sec.

20:53.049 --> 20:55.220
You're sending out some huge vibes.

20:56.049 --> 20:58.369
My fillings are still humming.
Rico...

20:58.450 --> 21:00.410
...refill my drink.
Win my devotion.

21:01.450 --> 21:03.839
- You saw something.
- I saw lots of things.

21:03.849 --> 21:05.740
- You're at a junction.
- So talk.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.720
So, no.

21:08.650 --> 21:11.250
- No? You won't tell me?
- You're in trouble.

21:11.650 --> 21:12.769
Big trouble.

21:13.450 --> 21:15.519
Let her go.
That way lies badness.

21:16.450 --> 21:20.450
You give murderous demons free advice,
but you won't help me.

21:20.650 --> 21:24.549
I set people on their paths, okay?
This is way off your path.

21:26.049 --> 21:28.190
- Go home.
- Tell me where Darla is.

21:29.049 --> 21:31.440
I know you won't start
anything in here.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.420
You're a good boy.

21:33.849 --> 21:36.339
Have a drink before you go.
It's on me.

21:41.650 --> 21:44.809
Angel Investigations,
solving big problems for less.

21:45.849 --> 21:48.759
- It's me. Did you get an address?
- It's him!

21:50.049 --> 21:52.579
Angel, we really think you need to--

21:53.049 --> 21:54.210
Address, now.

21:56.049 --> 21:58.509
DeEtta and Stephen Kramer
own a home...

21:59.049 --> 22:01.509
...at 1409 Galloway, Studio City.

22:02.049 --> 22:03.309
Got it.

22:03.849 --> 22:05.359
What are you looking at?

22:07.450 --> 22:09.200
He hung up.

22:09.849 --> 22:11.500
You really stood up to him.

22:11.650 --> 22:14.349
"I don't bend to him
like you, Wesley."

22:15.250 --> 22:16.450
Don't start with me.

22:16.450 --> 22:19.079
If I sound like that, shoot me.
I'm joking.

22:20.049 --> 22:22.369
It's not for you. It's a tranquilizer.

22:23.049 --> 22:26.380
You mean if Angel really goes crazy
like he did before?

22:26.650 --> 22:28.049
Think that'll do it?

22:29.650 --> 22:31.089
I better call Gunn.

22:54.490 --> 22:55.539
Thank you.

22:56.289 --> 22:57.730
Of course, sweetheart.

22:59.289 --> 23:00.369
Was that too much?

23:01.089 --> 23:04.420
If we're married, would I
still be holding your chair?

23:05.289 --> 23:07.319
That was fine. Now just eat.

23:16.089 --> 23:18.900
Actors try to find
the truth in the moment.

23:19.089 --> 23:22.599
Truthfully, I shouldn't
be holding your chair.

23:23.890 --> 23:27.009
This linguine smells so,
you know, true.

23:28.089 --> 23:30.829
I'll mime eating.
I gotta watch the figure.

23:34.089 --> 23:36.230
So is he watching us right now?

23:37.690 --> 23:39.509
Just nod and smile, Stephen.

23:40.690 --> 23:42.410
What did this guy do to you?

23:43.089 --> 23:46.390
All this trouble to get even?
Not that I mind working.

23:46.690 --> 23:49.319
Last year, I did this
puppet theater and--

23:54.490 --> 23:57.259
If you don't shut up,
I'm going to kill you.

23:57.490 --> 23:58.359
Okay.

23:58.690 --> 23:59.670
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:02.289 --> 24:03.799
Lindsey, can you hear me?

24:06.490 --> 24:08.420
I hear you.
How's the linguine?

24:08.890 --> 24:11.099
He's here, I can feel him,

24:11.289 --> 24:13.750
We know, Give me a few more minutes,

24:14.289 --> 24:15.339
Hurry up.

24:16.089 --> 24:17.670
Who are you talking to?

24:18.490 --> 24:19.539
I'm shutting up.

24:20.289 --> 24:24.009
This is all just precautionary.
When things get bad, Angel's a....

24:24.490 --> 24:25.819
- We trust him.
- I see.

24:26.289 --> 24:29.200
He doesn't turn evil
every time he gets cranky.

24:30.490 --> 24:31.539
He turns evil?

24:34.690 --> 24:37.710
Forces can revert Angel to Angelus,
who he was...

24:38.289 --> 24:39.900
...before he got his soul.

24:40.690 --> 24:43.460
How evil a vampire was Angelus?

24:43.690 --> 24:45.019
As bad as they come.

24:45.490 --> 24:47.980
Especially when he was with Darla.

24:48.490 --> 24:52.990
We're researching her to see if she
has some kind of resurrection powers.

24:53.890 --> 24:56.420
Maybe she's a vampire cat
with nine lives.

24:56.890 --> 24:58.960
So he and Darla together is bad.

24:59.890 --> 25:03.190
They ravaged half the world,
until Angel got a soul.

25:03.490 --> 25:06.930
Imagine Bonnie and Clyde,
if they had 150 years.

25:07.690 --> 25:09.650
So he thinks his girl is back.

25:10.089 --> 25:13.069
If he's back to his old ways,
how bad can it get?

25:28.890 --> 25:30.150
Hello, love.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.970
You made a mess out there.
Blood and habits everywhere.

25:36.690 --> 25:39.150
Convents. They're just
a big cookie jar.

25:39.690 --> 25:41.549
Black sky.

25:42.089 --> 25:44.650
It wants a little worm in me.

25:45.690 --> 25:46.769
No.

25:47.490 --> 25:48.650
No.

25:49.289 --> 25:52.410
What is she doing here?
I thought you killed her.

25:52.890 --> 25:54.609
No, just her family.

25:56.490 --> 25:58.069
--eyes like arrows.

25:58.289 --> 25:59.519
Like needles.

26:00.089 --> 26:03.000
This one's special.
I have big plans for her.

26:05.490 --> 26:09.210
Snake in the woodshed.
Snake in the woodshed.

26:10.289 --> 26:12.680
Snake in the woodshed.
Snake in the woodshed.

26:13.890 --> 26:17.579
- So do we kill her during or after?
- Neither.

26:19.890 --> 26:21.819
We turn her into one of us.

26:23.490 --> 26:26.539
Killing is so merciful, isn't it?
The pain ends.

26:28.890 --> 26:32.119
But to make her one of us....
She's a lunatic.

26:33.089 --> 26:34.529
Eternal torment.

26:38.490 --> 26:39.859
Am I learning?

27:01.890 --> 27:03.259
Lindsey, I'm waiting.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.039
You're on. Have fun.

27:12.690 --> 27:17.079
- 911, What's the emergency?
- I'm DeEtta Kramer at 1409 Galloway.

27:18.089 --> 27:22.130
There's a man outside. Oh, my God,
he's breaking into the house!

27:22.890 --> 27:24.920
He's gonna kill us! Help me!

27:25.289 --> 27:27.750
- Help me!
- I didn't sign up for this.

27:28.289 --> 27:30.990
- Do it. Make it look real.
- That was illegal.

27:34.289 --> 27:35.299
Help me!

27:35.490 --> 27:37.349
Somebody help me! My God!

27:39.089 --> 27:40.880
Someone help me!

27:41.490 --> 27:44.470
Don't hurt me! Please, no!
What did you do?

27:45.089 --> 27:48.180
Why did you? He was my husband!

27:48.690 --> 27:50.650
She should have her own series.

27:51.690 --> 27:52.809
Don't hurt me!

27:53.490 --> 27:54.609
What did you do?

28:09.250 --> 28:10.509
Turn around!

28:11.650 --> 28:12.950
On your knees. Do it!

28:16.450 --> 28:17.710
You'll pay for this.

28:21.849 --> 28:23.220
- In the attic.
- Right.

28:24.250 --> 28:27.130
- Seal the house. I want SWAT, now!
- You got it.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.109
He's on the roof.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.440
There he is!

28:32.049 --> 28:34.470
Go! Take the back! Move around!

28:35.650 --> 28:37.160
I don't understand,

28:38.049 --> 28:39.660
They shot him.

28:40.450 --> 28:42.170
How did he get away?

28:42.849 --> 28:46.009
Adrenaline. They chased him
for 16 blocks.

28:47.650 --> 28:50.000
Don't worry.
He can't hurt you now.

28:50.650 --> 28:53.740
They said you recognized him.
His name was Angel?

28:54.250 --> 28:55.930
That's what he told me.

28:56.049 --> 28:58.440
He started following me
a few weeks ago.

28:59.049 --> 29:00.940
He said he helped the helpless.

29:01.450 --> 29:05.589
I told him I didn't need any help.
He kept calling me Darla.

29:06.250 --> 29:10.039
He said he knew me or
this Darla from a long time ago.

29:11.049 --> 29:14.099
Today we were at the hotel
and he showed up again.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.930
Then tonight, he came here.

29:17.650 --> 29:21.970
I told him to stay out, that I was
calling the police and he broke in.

29:22.450 --> 29:26.349
This will sound crazy, but
something is wrong with his face.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.319
And he was biting.

29:29.650 --> 29:30.809
It isn't crazy.

29:31.450 --> 29:34.930
I want you to know I'll find him,
and he'll pay for this.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.650
Thank you, detective.

29:40.450 --> 29:43.359
Contact the hotel security
for any tapes of the...

29:44.049 --> 29:45.660
...incident with Mrs. Kramer.

29:45.849 --> 29:49.109
Make sure the coroner is careful
to preserve the scene.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.230
You all right?

29:55.450 --> 29:59.240
Just adjusting to the idea that
a good-guy vampire can go bad.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.140
It takes time.
We've been there.

30:02.650 --> 30:05.559
99 percent of the time he's good.
He's helped us.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.140
I respect loyalty a lot.

30:08.650 --> 30:09.519
That's good.

30:09.849 --> 30:13.329
But if the bad Angel returns,
I'll kill him in two seconds.

30:20.049 --> 30:21.099
Where is he?

30:22.450 --> 30:23.460
He's not here.

30:23.650 --> 30:25.299
Check every room.

30:26.049 --> 30:30.049
He's dangerous. Bullets might
not work. If you see him, call me.

30:30.250 --> 30:32.180
Do you have a search warrant?

30:32.650 --> 30:36.160
He killed Stephen Kramer
and kidnapped his wife.

30:36.849 --> 30:39.339
- He wouldn't.
- It's not the person he is.

30:40.450 --> 30:42.549
He's not a person at all, is he?

30:43.450 --> 30:46.930
You want to help yourselves out here,
or go down with him?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.000
So be it.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.250
- New player?
- He's a friend.

30:57.250 --> 30:59.569
- And what's your name?
- Charles Gunn.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.349
Let's see some I.D., Charles.

31:03.849 --> 31:05.950
- You got any priors?
- I forget.

31:07.450 --> 31:08.750
Montgomery, check it.

31:09.250 --> 31:11.140
Whatever you think Angel did--

31:11.650 --> 31:13.509
Who's Darla?

31:31.009 --> 31:33.470
So you're what Wolfram & Hart
brought back in that box.

31:34.009 --> 31:36.640
And they brought you back as human.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.630
They think I won't kill one.

31:42.410 --> 31:43.990
Wanna know what I think?

31:46.609 --> 31:49.069
I think they don't know me that well.

31:58.609 --> 32:01.559
You feel what this place was like
before they excavated it?

32:04.009 --> 32:05.200
It was a convent.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.289
You know how much I like convents.

32:13.609 --> 32:16.630
Come on, Darla. You and I are
too old to play games.

32:18.410 --> 32:20.369
I need to talk to the real you.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.980
It's been a long time
since I said this to anyone.

32:28.609 --> 32:30.750
But you can scream all you want.

32:38.210 --> 32:40.309
I'm not gonna scream.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.569
There's my boy.

33:00.849 --> 33:03.660
Well, look here.
"Disturbing the peace.

33:04.450 --> 33:07.890
Resisting arrest. GTA, assault."

33:08.650 --> 33:10.440
You've led a rich, full life.

33:11.049 --> 33:12.869
- I get around.
- I know this guy.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.359
He helps people.

33:14.650 --> 33:17.279
I bet this stuff happened
a long time ago.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.109
- Some of it was when he was a minor.
- Uh-huh.

33:20.650 --> 33:23.069
Some of it was
in the last two weeks.

33:23.650 --> 33:24.349
Oh.

33:24.849 --> 33:25.900
Word to the wise.

33:26.049 --> 33:28.579
These two and their
boss aren't good for you.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.369
I can see you're looking out for me,
detective.

33:32.049 --> 33:34.609
Let's not get off-track.
We want to find Angel too.

33:35.049 --> 33:35.990
No, you don't.

33:36.250 --> 33:39.440
You want to protect him,
even though he's lost it.

33:40.450 --> 33:44.000
He stalked that woman because
he thought she was this Darla.

33:44.650 --> 33:46.819
He knocked down the door...

33:47.049 --> 33:48.799
...and killed her husband.

33:49.450 --> 33:52.359
I know what he is,
and I know he hasn't changed.

33:53.049 --> 33:55.259
No, he hasn't. He's still a vampire.

33:56.049 --> 33:56.849
Not helping.

33:57.250 --> 33:59.569
So how'd he get in the house?
She invite him in?

33:59.650 --> 34:00.769
Of course she didn't in--

34:02.049 --> 34:04.539
The only way he could've
gotten in uninvited...

34:05.049 --> 34:06.980
...is if the real owners were dead.

34:07.450 --> 34:09.480
She isn't DeEtta Kramer.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.170
- You're grasping at straws.
- Are we?

34:12.250 --> 34:15.619
This is a daguerreotype of Darla,
taken over 100 years ago.

34:17.050 --> 34:19.679
The woman who said she was DeEtta--
Look familiar?

34:30.250 --> 34:31.409
That's enough.

34:33.250 --> 34:35.500
I'm pretty familiar with the
international sign for enough...

34:35.650 --> 34:37.579
...and you have a ways to go.

34:41.650 --> 34:44.420
You're hurting me. I like it.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.750
What's the play?

34:54.849 --> 34:56.780
What kind of game are you running?

34:57.250 --> 34:58.579
Just having a little fun.

34:59.050 --> 35:01.219
Been out of commission too long.
You know.

35:02.050 --> 35:04.079
They didn't bring you back for fun.

35:04.449 --> 35:06.480
The dreams, the frame-job.

35:07.449 --> 35:11.099
What's the plan?
Get me so screwed up I go bad again?

35:11.650 --> 35:15.090
Trite, I know. What do
you expect? They're only human.

35:16.449 --> 35:20.449
Better embrace that mediocrity.
You're human now.

35:21.250 --> 35:24.510
But I'm still me.
I remember everything.

35:24.849 --> 35:28.610
Everything we did,
everything we can do.

35:29.650 --> 35:30.980
Yeah.

35:31.449 --> 35:33.059
But the bitch is...

35:35.050 --> 35:36.559
...you have a soul now.

35:38.650 --> 35:39.630
Pretty soon...

35:40.449 --> 35:43.539
...those memories will start
eating away at you.

35:44.650 --> 35:46.119
No matter how hard you try...

35:46.449 --> 35:48.769
...you won't be able to escape
the truth of what you were.

35:49.449 --> 35:51.239
Believe me, I know.

35:52.449 --> 35:53.639
But you can escape.

35:55.449 --> 35:57.199
You can escape it all.

35:57.849 --> 36:00.099
Remember what it's like to get lost?

36:00.849 --> 36:02.989
Every thought a million miles away.

36:03.250 --> 36:05.880
Every part of your being alive.

36:07.449 --> 36:09.730
All you have to do is let me...

36:10.449 --> 36:13.539
...give you one little moment
of happiness.

36:15.250 --> 36:18.869
You took me places
and showed me things.

36:20.050 --> 36:22.190
You blew the top off my head.

36:23.050 --> 36:25.539
But you never made me happy.

36:31.449 --> 36:34.500
But that cheerleader did?

36:35.650 --> 36:38.530
We were together 150 years.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.969
We shared everything.

36:42.849 --> 36:44.739
You're saying never?

36:45.250 --> 36:47.179
You couldn't understand.

36:48.250 --> 36:49.969
I understand, all right.

36:50.650 --> 36:53.349
Taste something fresh,
you think you're touching God.

36:53.650 --> 36:56.179
- It wasn't--
- You bet your ass it was.

36:56.650 --> 36:58.469
In the early years...

36:59.050 --> 37:02.489
...you would've said
I was the definition of bliss.

37:04.449 --> 37:07.929
Buffy wasn't happiness.
She was just new.

37:09.849 --> 37:10.650
You know...

37:13.449 --> 37:16.289
...you're getting awfully
bent over this.

37:18.250 --> 37:21.019
I couldn't feel that with you...

37:21.849 --> 37:23.949
...because I didn't have a soul.

37:26.050 --> 37:28.190
But then I got a second chance...

37:29.050 --> 37:30.769
...just like you have.

37:33.849 --> 37:36.019
What a poster child for soulfulness!

37:40.449 --> 37:42.099
This is no life, Angel.

37:42.250 --> 37:45.550
You weren't just any vampire,
you were a legend.

37:46.449 --> 37:48.869
Nobody could keep up with you.
Not even me.

37:49.449 --> 37:52.119
You don't learn that.
It's innate.

37:52.449 --> 37:54.769
It was in you before we ever met.

37:55.449 --> 37:58.469
You said you can smell me?
Well, I can smell you too.

37:59.050 --> 38:01.889
My boy is still in there,
and he wants out.

38:09.809 --> 38:10.750
He's nowhere to be found.

38:11.010 --> 38:13.570
Some of you stay here
in case he shows.

38:15.809 --> 38:18.130
I'll be sure and mention
your cooperation in the report.

38:18.210 --> 38:20.559
We did more than that.
We solved the case.

38:21.210 --> 38:24.539
Whoever did away with the owners
of that house is your killer.

38:25.409 --> 38:28.110
- You don't get it.
- The fact that he's innocent?

38:29.010 --> 38:31.920
While you're fighting
your battles of good and evil...

38:32.610 --> 38:35.210
...the innocent are the ones
in the crossfire.

38:35.610 --> 38:37.610
Those are the ones I care about.

38:38.010 --> 38:41.590
Like that man tonight.
Or the real owners of that house.

38:42.210 --> 38:44.309
The ones I chalk up to your boss.

38:44.610 --> 38:46.260
You can't blame Angel--

38:48.210 --> 38:49.889
He's trying to do what's right.

38:50.010 --> 38:52.289
That's right, he's good.
I keep forgetting.

38:53.010 --> 38:55.610
And why did he
kidnap that woman again?

39:15.809 --> 39:17.250
You're going to feel it.

39:19.409 --> 39:20.670
What you did.

39:21.809 --> 39:23.320
That man you got killed.

39:23.610 --> 39:26.869
- Please. He was an actor.
- I'm serious.

39:28.409 --> 39:29.809
Like a heart attack.

39:31.409 --> 39:32.989
And just about as much fun.

39:33.210 --> 39:35.460
- Hurt anyone else and I'll kill you.
- Yeah?

39:36.210 --> 39:39.369
- Isn't that against your code?
- I'll make an exception.

39:41.010 --> 39:42.519
You'll miss those dreams.

39:43.409 --> 39:45.659
You should hear what
you say in your sleep.

39:46.409 --> 39:47.809
Nasty things, Angel.

39:48.210 --> 39:49.789
- Things--
- Stop it.

39:51.210 --> 39:52.539
No, you stop!

39:56.610 --> 39:59.070
No matter how good a boy you are...

40:02.010 --> 40:03.659
...God doesn't want you.

40:14.010 --> 40:15.690
But I still do.

40:29.610 --> 40:32.699
What, no goodbye kiss?

41:05.090 --> 41:06.349
It's us.

41:15.889 --> 41:17.429
We didn't see you all day.

41:18.289 --> 41:21.130
We just wondered
if everything was copacetic.

41:21.889 --> 41:23.119
I didn't go bad.

41:23.690 --> 41:25.579
I was never worried about that.

41:26.090 --> 41:29.389
- Mr. Fussy Pants assumes the worst.
- What? I didn't....

41:30.889 --> 41:32.639
- I never--
- Anything else?

41:33.889 --> 41:35.750
Can't think of a thing.

41:36.289 --> 41:37.230
Angel.

41:37.489 --> 41:39.030
- Careful.
- What do you mean?

41:39.289 --> 41:43.469
It's just with Darla back, in
league with Wolfram & Hart...

41:44.690 --> 41:46.829
...there are many forces
against you.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.050
There's going to be trouble.

41:49.489 --> 41:51.559
There's gonna be a lot of trouble.

41:53.090 --> 41:54.739
And I say bring it on.

42:35.690 --> 42:37.579
Thank you, thank you very much,
