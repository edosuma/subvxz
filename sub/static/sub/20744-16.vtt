take to get America's vote.
>> The kind of talent tonight is

02:52.768 --> 02:56.370
absolutely outstanding.
Just because you love somebody

02:56.371 --> 02:58.039

through.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.999

- Well, gets get to it.

03:06.448 --> 03:09.483
Let's do this.
First up, is a performer who

03:09.484 --> 03:12.753
used to work as a ventilation
and heating engineer, but he

03:12.754 --> 03:15.923
always dreamed of being a
superstar contortionist,

03:15.924 --> 03:23.924
shooting for a spot in the semi
finals, her is vello vaha.

03:29.504 --> 03:30.000
I am ready for my interview.
A big shot in America.

03:30.001 --> 03:38.001
I am ready for my interview.
A big shot in America.

03:41.116 --> 03:46.587
In Hollywood, audiologyll of the big
stars like Johnny depp.

03:46.588 --> 03:54.588
And now me.

03:57.966 --> 03:59.999
I think you are
wonderfully crazy.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.436
I think you are
wonderfully crazy.

04:02.437 --> 04:07.842
It's like a big fish in a
little pond.

04:07.843 --> 04:15.843
I'm here because I want to be
big fish in pacific ocean.

04:22.557 --> 04:29.999
If I win "America's got
talent," my next star will be

04:30.000 --> 04:33.868

Vello vaher!
Well, I mean, I was going to go

07:30.000 --> 07:32.112
vello vaher!
Well, I mean, I was going to go

07:32.113 --> 07:37.718
to Heidi, but Simon, you gave
vello an x.

07:37.719 --> 07:42.756
- What's going on?
- Why are you booing?

07:42.757 --> 07:46.360
I liked the ship, but if we took
the ship away, it was

07:46.361 --> 07:49.263
essentially like a sack on a
conveyor belt.

07:49.264 --> 07:54.535
And that was sort of it.
So you want to be big fish, big

07:54.536 --> 07:59.940
pond.
You need to do better act.

07:59.941 --> 08:00.000
Wow.
So Howie, you seem to beg to

08:05.513 --> 08:06.348

08:06.349 --> 08:11.118
You know what, it's the
originality is amazing.

08:11.119 --> 08:14.722
Are you a contortionist?
It doesn't matter.

08:14.723 --> 08:19.793
I love what you do.

08:19.794 --> 08:22.262
And that being said, I have one
question.

08:22.263 --> 08:26.433
And that is, what do you do?
What is that?

08:26.434 --> 08:29.999
It's amazing.
I don't know what it is.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.472
It's amazing.
I don't know what it is.

08:30.473 --> 08:34.708
Thank you.
>> I want a chance to be

08:34.709 --> 08:37.544

08:37.545 --> 08:39.613
Yes!
You are original.

08:39.614 --> 08:43.517
Well‐said, vello.
Mel b., what did you think?

08:43.518 --> 08:46.687
I mean, it was a little
bit crazy, but that's you.

08:46.688 --> 08:49.189
That's why you're likeable and
the way you do that stuff with

08:49.190 --> 08:52.393
your body is a bit nuts.
But I kind of like it!

08:52.394 --> 08:55.396
I like seeing it!
>> Thank you.

08:55.397 --> 08:57.698

You're very bizarre and I love
that.

09:05.674 --> 09:13.013
I enjoy watching you every time.
And you are wrong, Simon.

09:13.014 --> 09:14.481
Thank you.
Thank you.

09:14.482 --> 09:19.453
You like Simon, vello.
But he said you're ‐‐ you were a

09:19.454 --> 09:23.624
sack up here.
How do you feel about that?

09:23.625 --> 09:29.999
I respect all of what the
judges said.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.367
I respect all of what the
judges said.

09:33.368 --> 09:34.868

Welcome back to
"America's got talent"!

10:41.673 --> 10:46.510
We are live in Hollywood!
The fight for the semi finals is

10:46.511 --> 10:49.872
going down.
Now, there is an old saying.

10:49.873 --> 10:52.107
"Fall down seven times, get up
eight."

10:52.108 --> 10:58.047
That's what this next singer had
to do to keep the dream alive.

10:58.048 --> 11:02.030
She is ronee Martin.
>> I looked at people and I

11:02.031 --> 11:09.458
she is ronee Martin.
>> I looked at people and I

11:09.459 --> 11:12.828
never thought as myself as that
person.

11:12.829 --> 11:15.331
You know.
I wanted to get married.

11:15.332 --> 11:20.369
Have kids.
But it just didn't happen.

11:20.370 --> 11:23.772
Like singing.
Over the years, I realized that

11:23.773 --> 11:25.474
this wasn't going to happen for
me.

11:25.475 --> 11:28.811
So I just went back to my 9:00
to 5:00, which is where I've

11:28.812 --> 11:32.030
been for the last 22 years.♪♪♪♪

11:32.031 --> 11:33.983
Been for the last 22 years.♪♪♪♪

11:33.984 --> 11:36.051
For me, it's not how
old you are.

11:36.052 --> 11:40.256
If you've got it, you've got it.
>> At 62 years old, for my

11:40.257 --> 11:43.859
singing to come back to my life
sort of balances out what didn't

11:43.860 --> 11:46.228
happen.
The house with the picket fence

11:46.229 --> 11:49.265
and the family and the tomato
soup on a cold day.

11:49.266 --> 11:51.867
I feel now that my life is
changing.

11:51.868 --> 11:54.003
We have to do this thing called
living.

11:54.004 --> 11:59.141
And it goes by very fast.
To finally believe in myself at

11:59.142 --> 12:02.030
62 years old, I am not going to
let it go now.

12:02.031 --> 12:03.831

Stop it!
Never mind, you look amazing.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.234
You're going to get it, Simon,
later.

14:39.235 --> 14:43.172
Every time you come out you have
such class and inner strength,

14:43.173 --> 14:45.207
and your voice is just
beautiful!

14:45.208 --> 14:46.809
Beautiful.

14:46.810 --> 14:48.677
You don't oversing, and it's
just natural.

14:48.678 --> 14:51.547
- Amazing.
- Heidi.

14:51.548 --> 14:54.316
I just love you.
I just do.

14:54.317 --> 14:56.885
You're super chic, and every
time you sing it's like giving

14:56.886 --> 14:59.054
us a gift.
Thank you very much.

14:59.055 --> 15:00.222
Simon.

15:00.223 --> 15:02.030
This is the first time
on any show somebody said this

15:02.031 --> 15:02.692
this is the first time
on any show somebody said this

15:02.693 --> 15:04.927
is all about getting tomato
soup.

15:04.928 --> 15:08.363
So this is a first.
I think it's all about the

15:08.364 --> 15:10.232
public now.
I think you have done everything

15:10.233 --> 15:12.267
you can do.
You've laid your soul on the

15:12.268 --> 15:13.569
line.
You have told the American

15:13.570 --> 15:16.605
public what you're all about.
It was a great choice of song,

15:16.606 --> 15:20.709
great lyrics.
I hope they support you.

15:20.710 --> 15:24.213
- Howie.
- The song is "lean on

15:24.214 --> 15:26.181
me" and you are leaning on
America and this is why they

15:26.182 --> 15:27.983
have to vote!

15:27.984 --> 15:32.030
You may have to bring it home.
You deserve to be a star, and

15:32.031 --> 15:32.689
you may have to bring it home.
You deserve to be a star, and

15:32.690 --> 15:37.226
America, you've got to make her
a star.

15:37.227 --> 15:44.333
Ms. ronee Martin.
You chose the bill withers "lean

15:44.334 --> 15:46.835
on me."
How to you stay so motivated and

15:46.836 --> 15:48.770
being that true example of
someone who is going to keep

15:48.771 --> 15:52.274
going to live on with a dream?
>> Because my parents were

15:52.275 --> 15:54.576
always there for me to lean on
them.

15:54.577 --> 15:56.745
So ‐‐ and I understand what
leaning on is.

15:56.746 --> 15:59.448
So I know we all need to lean on
each other.

15:59.449 --> 16:01.483
There it is.

Most brothers and sisters fight

Most brothers and sisters fight

17:12.860 --> 17:15.427
when they're kids.
But here is a young magician and

So, yeah, I kind of wanted to be
like my dad.

17:32.512 --> 17:35.781

17:38.818 --> 17:42.634
making my sister disappear.
>> I help my brother with his

17:42.635 --> 17:42.856
making my sister disappear.
>> I help my brother with his

17:42.857 --> 17:45.357
magic, because normally he
forces me to.

17:45.358 --> 17:47.559
But I kind of like it.
>> They are brother and sister,

17:47.560 --> 17:51.063
but they are also best friends.
>> Give it to me!

17:51.064 --> 17:59.064
In our first performance, my
brother turned me into a

17:59.539 --> 18:02.374
princess.
Instead he sawed me.

18:02.375 --> 18:05.577
I wasn't too happy about that.
>> For our next performance, it

18:05.578 --> 18:07.913
is going to be great.
I've been working on it nonstop.

18:07.914 --> 18:10.682
No, I have a better idea.
>> I've got a few ideas of my

18:10.683 --> 18:12.634
own.
>> Since I've been a magician,

18:12.635 --> 18:15.087
own.
>> Since I've been a magician,

18:15.088 --> 18:16.989
I've been wanting to get more
involved in the act.

18:16.990 --> 18:19.525
Yeah, she helps me.
>> I do more than help you.

18:19.526 --> 18:22.861
I am the act.
I'm a star.

18:22.862 --> 18:25.597
I'm very excited to prove to
America that I have what it

18:25.598 --> 18:29.234
takes to go to the next round.
>> We have what it takes to go

18:29.235 --> 18:32.105
to the next round.
>> We have what it takes.

18:39.812 --> 18:42.634
Good evening, judges.
And good evening to all of the

18:47.387 --> 18:52.057
My sister is holding in her
hands four pair of handcuffs,

18:52.058 --> 18:54.293
she will be passing these out to
the judges for their

18:54.294 --> 18:55.128
examination.
>> Thank you.

18:55.129 --> 18:57.329
You're welcome.
>> Thank you.

18:57.330 --> 19:02.134
Mr. Howie, please don't try
to lock up Ms. Mel b., please.

19:02.135 --> 19:06.738
Hi.

19:06.739 --> 19:09.208
Once you have inspected the
handcuffs I'm going to ask each

19:09.209 --> 19:12.511
of you to lock them around my
wrists.

19:12.512 --> 19:12.635
Okay.
Well, they are real.

19:12.636 --> 19:14.146
Okay.
Well, they are real.

19:14.147 --> 19:18.984

19:18.985 --> 19:21.286
Wow.
There we go.

19:21.287 --> 19:25.390
Are you sure about this?
>> Yes, I am.

19:25.391 --> 19:28.860
Like Heidi's house, right?

19:28.861 --> 19:31.964
How do you know?
>> I'm taking these and placing

19:31.965 --> 19:36.501
them inside the box in case
anything goes wrong.

19:36.502 --> 19:42.634
Inside we have bolt cutters.
A box of bandages.

19:42.635 --> 19:43.543
Inside we have bolt cutters.
A box of bandages.

19:43.544 --> 19:47.412
And ‐‐ a peanut butter jelly
sandwich.

19:47.413 --> 19:54.253
In case I get hungry.
>> Tonight I'm going to attempt

19:54.254 --> 19:56.388
to do something no kid has ever
done before.

No, my kids do not do that.

21:49.836 --> 21:53.338
So don't get any ideas, kid.
I love that.

You always have a surprise for
us.

And you always have something

What I want to know is, if you
win the million dollars, how are

21:58.811 --> 22:01.546
you going to split that?
>> 50/50.

22:01.547 --> 22:05.450
50/50, good thinking.
Because otherwise, Brooklyn, I

22:05.451 --> 22:07.786

Simon, what did you think?

Simon:

You are like a real live Harry

I've got to tell you,
both of you, no nerves, great

22:26.038 --> 22:28.340
showmanship, I have no idea what
just happened.

22:28.341 --> 22:31.209
I was watching the box, you were
over there.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.044
So it was fantastic and creepy.
Brilliant.

22:33.045 --> 22:34.013
Well done.
>> Thank you so much!

22:34.014 --> 22:37.849
Howie!

You know, you really
did step it up for the live

Great magic, you're just kids.

That element of surprise.

22:57.637 --> 23:01.807
Oh, my gosh, there you are!
That is magic, and I loved it.

28:31.989 --> 28:39.989
for the very first day I met you

you.
I think that you also inspire

28:45.969 --> 28:48.371
me.
I'm going to be honest with you.

28:48.372 --> 28:51.173
I didn't think this was the
perfect song choice.

28:51.174 --> 28:54.677
I didn't think it went
particularly well.

28:54.678 --> 28:57.713
For the first half or maybe even
the first three quarters.

28:57.714 --> 28:59.837
And then you, sir, on the right,
as you always do, you just come

and then you, sir, on the right,
as you always do, you just come

29:00.951 --> 29:05.154
out with that killer note.
Right at the end.

29:05.155 --> 29:08.157
So I hope America put you
forward.

29:08.158 --> 29:11.160
I think going forward, we should
be doing better songs.

29:11.161 --> 29:13.763
A little more imagination.
But I think that I was watching

29:13.764 --> 29:16.265

He's such a sunshine for me.
I think I'm the luckiest mom in

32:00.782 --> 32:06.019
- the world.
- Mom, you're a great

32:06.020 --> 32:09.490
dancer, but your son, I could
not take my eyes off of him.

32:09.491 --> 32:13.360
My wife and I have been
dancing together for nine years.

32:13.361 --> 32:16.830
We have had nine championships,
and we started our own studio.

32:16.831 --> 32:20.200
Daniel one day asked me,
could you please teach me?

32:20.201 --> 32:24.171
That's when he fell in love with
dancing.

32:24.172 --> 32:24.986
Wrong step, daddy.
>> I am doing it!

32:24.987 --> 32:26.173
Wrong step, daddy.
>> I am doing it!

32:26.174 --> 32:29.376
I do love dancing with girls
my age, but I love dancing with

32:29.377 --> 32:34.114
my mom better, because with my
mom, I can do anything.

32:34.115 --> 32:37.618
I'm immensely proud of them.
>> He is amazing.

32:37.619 --> 32:39.453
No, truly.
He is amazing.

32:39.454 --> 32:43.557
I want to win "America's got
talent" so much, because it

32:43.558 --> 32:46.193
would mean that we are the best
mother and son dance team in the

32:46.194 --> 32:50.265
world.

Come on down here.

34:22.056 --> 34:24.985
Having some fun.
Howie mandel!

34:24.986 --> 34:26.860
Having some fun.
Howie mandel!

34:26.861 --> 34:30.163
Yeah.

34:30.164 --> 34:34.668
How could you, Howie?

34:34.669 --> 34:37.371
I think that is for Howie.

34:37.372 --> 34:39.940
Let me be honest, let
me tell you something.

34:39.941 --> 34:42.409
The level of talent in the live
show is growing.

34:42.410 --> 34:44.978
And this is what I saw.
When we first saw you, you were

34:44.979 --> 34:46.580
a surprise.
And young man, you are an

34:46.581 --> 34:48.348
amazing dancer and so is your
mother.

34:48.349 --> 34:50.851
But it's the same.
This is the third I'm I'm seeing

34:50.852 --> 34:53.153
the same moves with the hair,
the exact same moves, the

34:53.154 --> 34:54.985
staging is different.

34:54.986 --> 34:56.390
Staging is different.

34:56.391 --> 34:59.426
You're not growing.
I've seen the same and the third

34:59.427 --> 35:02.095
time, third strike, you're out,
as far as I'm concerned.

35:02.096 --> 35:05.766
- >> Oh!
- That's harsh!

35:05.767 --> 35:08.702
Don't worry, Howie
mandel cannot dance.

35:08.703 --> 35:12.005
- I can.
- But Mel b., you are a

35:12.006 --> 35:14.941
dance he.
>> Yeah, I mean, it wasn't

35:14.942 --> 35:16.109
buzz‐worthy.
Come on!

35:16.110 --> 35:19.613
They were dancing their hearts
and souls out up there!

35:19.614 --> 35:21.782
I mean, I must admit, I think

35:21.783 --> 35:24.985
last time I did say to you I
wanted more things packed into

35:24.986 --> 35:25.687
last time I did say to you I
wanted more things packed into

35:25.688 --> 35:27.120
it.
I think if you want to go

35:27.121 --> 35:31.625
through you have to add more.
But it was not buzz‐worthy.

35:31.626 --> 35:34.194
It was good.
Stop!

35:34.195 --> 35:36.196
- Heidi.
- I do think it's going

35:36.197 --> 35:38.131
to be a tough night for you guys
tonight.

35:38.132 --> 35:40.901
But there is something really
sweet about this act.

35:40.902 --> 35:44.104
And you for being 8 years old,
you can really keep up with your

35:44.105 --> 35:46.006
mom.
And mom, I'm sure, is very proud

35:46.007 --> 35:50.043
of you

35:50.044 --> 35:54.985
now, Simon, you buzzed
Howie for buzzing them.

35:54.986 --> 35:55.216
Now, Simon, you buzzed
Howie for buzzing them.

35:55.217 --> 35:59.019
I want to be
constructive and helpful, I

35:59.020 --> 36:03.757
think Daniel, should fire your
mom and your mom can do another

36:03.758 --> 36:05.625
show if you're voted through on
your own.

36:05.626 --> 36:08.028
I don't think it's working as
mom and dad.

36:08.029 --> 36:11.932
It wouldn't be the first time a
son has fired his mother on a

36:11.933 --> 36:15.736
- show so it's a good thing.
- Well, good luck.

36:15.737 --> 36:18.672
Great job.
Voting is now open, America.

36:18.673 --> 36:21.942
So you can vote for them, and
you can vote up to ten times for

36:21.943 --> 36:24.111
each act with each voting
method.

36:24.112 --> 36:24.986
So get to it.
>>> Okay.

36:24.986 --> 36:25.880
So get to it.
>>> Okay.

36:25.881 --> 36:30.250
The next act is coming up, and
the guys have only this

36:30.251 --> 36:32.819
commercial break to reset the
stage.

36:32.820 --> 36:36.289
There is an incredible magician
waiting backstage, praying they

36:36.290 --> 36:38.056
can make it.
So stay right there.

36:49.174 --> 36:54.375
- ♪♪♪♪- Welcome back!

36:54.376 --> 36:59.414
This is "America's got talent"!
And we are live in Hollywood!

36:59.415 --> 37:02.617
Now, the guys are still working,
but they've almost got the stage

37:02.618 --> 37:04.819
ready.
So let's get to the next act.

37:04.820 --> 37:07.789
When this performer was a kid
growing up in Indiana, he faced

37:07.790 --> 37:11.993
a lot of problems.
But magic was his salvation.

37:11.994 --> 37:15.569
He is Blake vogt.
>> Growing up with a family of

37:15.570 --> 37:23.570
he is Blake vogt.
>> Growing up with a family of

37:24.640 --> 37:27.508
farmers, people assumed I would
get into farming, but I didn't

37:27.509 --> 37:29.978
do that.
>> When Blake was about 3 years

37:29.979 --> 37:33.715
old, he had a juice container
and a bee got down in that.

37:33.716 --> 37:35.483
And he actually swallowed that
bee.

37:35.484 --> 37:38.720
I flat lined on the ambulance
on the way in, and they did a

37:38.721 --> 37:43.725
test on my blood and found out I
have 109 different allergies.

37:43.726 --> 37:45.569
Peanuts, milk, dust, wheat,
shellfish, onion, cats, dogs,

37:45.570 --> 37:49.597
peanuts, milk, dust, wheat,
shellfish, onion, cats, dogs,

37:49.598 --> 37:52.367
Johnson grass, Timothy grass,
which I don't know the

37:52.368 --> 37:54.135
difference of, so I stay away
from grass.

37:54.136 --> 37:58.106
With all of my cousins, being
outside in the field, I kind of

37:58.107 --> 38:02.443
would stay inside with my
grandma and we always played

38:02.444 --> 38:04.746
cards.
I never really cheated while we

38:04.747 --> 38:06.247
were playing.
>> Oh, no.

38:06.248 --> 38:08.583
But if I did, you wouldn't
know it.

38:08.584 --> 38:10.551
No.
>> I never left the house, just

38:10.552 --> 38:13.621
playing with magic all day,
every day.

38:13.622 --> 38:15.569
So you are a wizard.
>> For my performance tonight,

38:15.570 --> 38:17.859
so you are a wizard.
>> For my performance tonight,

38:17.860 --> 38:22.897
I'm doing something I created
just for this show.

38:22.898 --> 38:25.666
I've never done it anywhere
before, and it's live.

38:25.667 --> 38:29.904
I hope I don't mess up, and I
don't black out.

38:29.905 --> 38:37.905
And everybody loves it.

38:38.414 --> 38:40.581
Thank you so much!
I've graduated something brand

38:40.582 --> 38:43.851
new for you this evening and
it's hanging in the air inside

38:43.852 --> 38:45.569
that box.
Before we get to that, I need

38:45.570 --> 38:45.788
that box.
Before we get to that, I need

38:45.789 --> 38:47.789
somebody from the audience to
help me.

38:47.790 --> 38:51.092
So let's see.
Yeah, yeah, you ma'am here in

38:51.093 --> 38:53.461
the maroon.
Do you mind helping me?

38:53.462 --> 38:55.630
You can stay seated.
What I want you to do is point

38:55.631 --> 38:59.367
to anyone around you don't know.
We need this to be random, okay?

38:59.368 --> 39:02.036
So point to somebody.
Okay, you ma'am, in the black.

39:02.037 --> 39:03.905
You mind helping?
You can stay seated.

39:03.906 --> 39:06.507
And it's important to know, we
don't know each other and we

39:06.508 --> 39:08.709
didn't set anything up, right?
Excellent.

39:08.710 --> 39:11.212
Ma'am, we're going to get you a
microphone.

39:11.213 --> 39:15.049
In the meantime, I want to draw
you are your attention to this

39:15.050 --> 39:15.570
box hanging inside the air.
Magicians are famous for being

39:15.571 --> 39:18.886
box hanging inside the air.
Magicians are famous for being

39:18.887 --> 39:20.788
able to produce doves out of
nowhere.

39:20.789 --> 39:23.858
I'm the only magician in the
world that can produce any bird

39:23.859 --> 39:25.593
names.
There are over 9,000 different

39:25.594 --> 39:28.062
species of birds, and I can
produce any of them.

39:28.063 --> 39:32.700
So ma'am, please say out loud
any bird in the entire world.

39:32.701 --> 39:37.105
Um ‐‐ um ‐‐ blue Jay.
>> Blue Jay?

39:37.106 --> 39:39.607
Yeah.
>> Out of all of the birds.

39:39.608 --> 39:41.242
Blue Jay.
Here we go, check this out.

39:41.243 --> 39:45.569
Blue Jay.
Blue Jay egg!

39:45.570 --> 39:46.315
Blue Jay.
Blue Jay egg!

39:46.316 --> 39:48.950
Thank you!

39:48.951 --> 39:51.085
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Yes.

39:51.086 --> 39:53.421
Now, unfortunately, I'm allergic
to all of the birds.

39:53.422 --> 39:58.659
So this is the next best thing.
Simon, this is for you, in case

39:58.660 --> 40:01.195
a blue Jay starts to hatch, let
me know.

40:01.196 --> 40:03.498
Howie, for you, what I have is a
deck of cards.

40:03.499 --> 40:06.067
I'm going to leave this in front
of you, please don't touch it

40:06.068 --> 40:08.369
until the very end, okay?
>> Easy.

40:08.370 --> 40:11.672
I won't touch anything.
Howie, in a deck of cards, there

40:11.673 --> 40:14.308
are picture cards and number
cards, which would you like to

40:14.309 --> 40:15.569
remove from the deck, the
picture cards or the number

40:15.570 --> 40:16.611
remove from the deck, the
picture cards or the number

40:16.612 --> 40:18.513
cards?
>> The number cards.

40:18.514 --> 40:21.916
Number cards.
We'll remove the number cards.

40:21.917 --> 40:27.889
Mel b., that leads the picture
cards, I want you to take those,

40:27.890 --> 40:30.424
four of a kind.
Which would you like, Jacks,

40:30.425 --> 40:32.793
kings or queens?
>> Queens.

40:32.794 --> 40:38.166
Heidi, we're down to four
cards, the queen of clubs, queen

40:38.167 --> 40:41.102
hearts, spades and diamonds.
I want you to change your mind a

40:41.103 --> 40:44.138
few times so you are certain
it's a random decision and

40:44.139 --> 40:45.569
narrow it down to one card.
>> Queen of diamonds.

40:45.570 --> 40:47.308
Narrow it down to one card.
>> Queen of diamonds.

40:47.309 --> 40:49.944
Okay.
So 52 cards down to one.

40:49.945 --> 40:53.347
The queen of diamonds.
Howie, look inside the box.

40:53.348 --> 40:55.483
Are you kidding me?
>> Check it out.

40:55.484 --> 40:57.685
What's inside?
>> There's nothing ‐‐ it's

40:57.686 --> 40:59.787
empty.
>> That would have been cool

40:59.788 --> 41:01.088
though!
That would have been cool.

41:01.089 --> 41:02.657
That would have been pretty
good.

41:02.658 --> 41:04.425
Yes.
That would have been great.

41:04.426 --> 41:07.128
But you would have expected
that, if there would have been a

41:07.129 --> 41:09.030
blue Jay in the box, you would
have expected it.

41:09.031 --> 41:11.332
If the queen of diamonds would
have been in the box, you would

41:11.333 --> 41:14.168
have expected it.
But there is one place nobody

41:14.169 --> 41:15.569
expects the queen of diamonds to
be.

41:15.570 --> 41:17.638
Expects the queen of diamonds to
be.

41:17.639 --> 41:19.440
- In the egg.
- No.

41:19.441 --> 41:22.910
Simon, I have a little dish
here for you, and a rag in case

41:22.911 --> 41:25.413
it gets messy.
What I want you to do is crack

41:25.414 --> 41:27.915
open that egg into the dish.
And inside, where there should

41:27.916 --> 41:31.152
be a blue Jay ‐‐ there's a
playing card.

41:31.153 --> 41:34.822
Now you guys narrowed it down
from 52 down to 1.

41:34.823 --> 41:38.125
And Heidi, you had the final
decision, and it is the queen of

41:38.126 --> 41:43.130
diamonds!

41:43.131 --> 41:45.569
Magic!
Now, as cool as that was, I know

41:45.570 --> 41:49.804
magic!
Now, as cool as that was, I know

41:49.805 --> 41:51.739
what you're thinking.
You still would have loved to

41:51.740 --> 41:54.175
see a blue Jay.
But I'm not kidding, I am very

41:54.176 --> 41:58.981
allergic to blue jays.
So this is the next best thing.

42:11.360 --> 42:15.229
Blake vogt with the magic!

42:15.230 --> 42:15.570
We don't know how you did it,
but it was awesome.

42:15.571 --> 42:21.135
We don't know how you did it,
but it was awesome.

42:21.136 --> 42:24.338
- Mel b.
- I'm just like confused.

42:24.339 --> 42:28.376
I'm really confused.
Like ‐‐ I always try and figure

42:28.377 --> 42:31.646
stuff out, but then I believe in
magic and I'm like, oh, gosh!

42:31.647 --> 42:35.149
Wow!
So I'm like, wow!

42:35.150 --> 42:36.717
That's a good thing!
>> Thank you.

42:36.718 --> 42:39.220
- Thank you, thank you.
- That's a good thing.

42:39.221 --> 42:40.755
- >> Thank you.
- Heidi.

42:40.756 --> 42:44.825
Yeah, I was literally
going back and forth in my head.

42:44.826 --> 42:45.570
Diamonds, hearts.
Literally, this close to say

42:45.571 --> 42:46.727
diamonds, hearts.
Literally, this close to say

42:46.728 --> 42:49.563
heart, and then I went diamonds.
I mean, I don't know how you do

42:49.564 --> 42:51.165
it.
You know, we expect so much from

42:51.166 --> 42:54.035
you, and you really always
deliver.

42:54.036 --> 42:56.771
Thank you, Heidi.
Thank you.

42:56.772 --> 43:00.174
Simon, I see this
perplexed look on your face.

43:00.175 --> 43:03.811
- You have the egg in your hand.
- The card just came out

43:03.812 --> 43:07.782
of an egg.
I don't know how ‐‐ what just

43:07.783 --> 43:10.117
happened here.

to see you headlining in Vegas

1:10:25.752 --> 1:10:27.386
within two years.
I can feel it.

1:10:27.387 --> 1:10:31.390
Brilliant.

1:10:31.391 --> 1:10:35.060
- He.
- He wants to hug you,

1:10:35.061 --> 1:10:37.130
- Simon.
- Come here.

1:10:46.439 --> 1:10:46.446
A lot of hugging going on.

1:10:46.447 --> 1:10:48.908
A lot of hugging going on.

1:10:48.909 --> 1:10:52.578
Howie, you want to get in on
that hug?

1:10:52.579 --> 1:10:57.816
Good luck to malevo.
Hey, let's keep it going!

1:10:57.817 --> 1:11:01.654
These next two guys have a
pretty simple ambition.

1:11:01.655 --> 1:11:05.057
They want to be the first
world‐famous jugglers.

1:11:05.058 --> 1:11:09.161
This could get them one step
closer.

1:11:09.162 --> 1:11:12.498
Here's the passing zone.
>> I think a lot of people

1:11:12.499 --> 1:11:15.134
expect that maybe a juggler has
some crazy life, and maybe we

1:11:15.135 --> 1:11:16.445
live in a circus tent or
something.

1:11:16.446 --> 1:11:17.137
Live in a circus tent or
something.

1:11:17.138 --> 1:11:20.472
At the end of the day, we're
dads.

1:11:20.473 --> 1:11:22.808
We're just normal guys.
>> Oh, yeah.

1:11:22.809 --> 1:11:26.111
Oh!
>> Yep.

1:11:26.112 --> 1:11:30.049
We've been working together
for 28 years now.

1:11:30.050 --> 1:11:33.252
After working together that
long, we start to act a lot

1:11:33.253 --> 1:11:35.688
alike.
Even when we're not together.

1:11:35.689 --> 1:11:42.161
See you later!
>> Bye!

1:11:42.162 --> 1:11:45.230
Simon seems to like some of
the stuff we have done so far on

1:11:45.231 --> 1:11:46.445
the show, because we're getting
other people on stage and

1:11:46.446 --> 1:11:47.700
the show, because we're getting
other people on stage and

1:11:47.701 --> 1:11:51.203
putting them in danger.
>> We'd like to ask Mel b. To

1:11:51.204 --> 1:11:54.239
come join us on stage.
>> We haven't forgotten about

1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:56.809
Howie.
>> Great.

1:11:56.810 --> 1:12:01.480
Now!
>> Oh!

1:12:01.481 --> 1:12:04.850
The act has now to include
Howie permanently.

1:12:04.851 --> 1:12:08.053
Obviously, Mel.
And I would like to ‐‐ thanks a

1:12:08.054 --> 1:12:09.121
lot.
Good night, everyone!

1:12:09.122 --> 1:12:12.725
Thank you, everybody!
>> Tonight we've bumped it up.

1:12:12.726 --> 1:12:14.393
Three judges.
>> Oh, yeah.

1:12:14.394 --> 1:12:16.445
Middle?
>> Somebody could get hurt.

1:12:16.446 --> 1:12:16.863
Middle?
>> Somebody could get hurt.

1:12:16.864 --> 1:12:19.598
And if something goes wrong,
it's Simon's fault.

1:12:19.599 --> 1:12:22.935
Yes.
>> Yeah.

1:12:22.936 --> 1:12:28.807
Thank you!

1:12:28.808 --> 1:12:29.709
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1:12:29.710 --> 1:12:34.113
Of you know, as jugglers, our
job is to conquer gravity and

1:12:34.114 --> 1:12:38.717
make things fly.
>> We'vejuggled dangerous things, but

1:12:38.718 --> 1:12:41.987
right now we are going to juggle
things that are very heavy.

1:12:41.988 --> 1:12:44.657
We have been training with
bowling ball juggling.

1:12:44.658 --> 1:12:46.445
What would be more impressive
than juggling with one bowling

1:12:46.446 --> 1:12:47.459
what would be more impressive
than juggling with one bowling

1:12:47.460 --> 1:12:48.861
ball?
Well, two.

1:12:48.862 --> 1:12:50.396
Oh ‐‐ >> oh, my god.

1:12:50.397 --> 1:12:53.432
No, no, he's okay.
>> That's just ‐‐

1:12:53.433 --> 1:12:56.368
oh, my goodness.
>> It's just rubber.

1:12:56.369 --> 1:12:57.836
Got them again.
There we go.

1:12:57.837 --> 1:12:59.605
Every time.
>> That's great.

1:12:59.606 --> 1:13:01.473
We're not even going to
juggle those.

1:13:01.474 --> 1:13:03.909
Actually, tonight, we are going
to go where no juggler has gone

1:13:03.910 --> 1:13:07.980
before.
>> Simon's house?

1:13:07.981 --> 1:13:11.150
No, no, no.
Tonight, the danger is not about

1:13:11.151 --> 1:13:13.652
what we are juggling.
It's about who.

1:13:13.653 --> 1:13:16.445
Because we are going to
juggle people.

1:13:16.446 --> 1:13:16.623
Because we are going to
juggle people.

1:13:16.624 --> 1:13:19.258
Yes.
>> Oh, yeah.

1:13:19.259 --> 1:13:22.127
Now, in order to prepare for
this mission, we have been

1:13:22.128 --> 1:13:25.464
closely studying our space
program, and we're pretty sure

1:13:25.465 --> 1:13:27.833
that we have figured it out.
>> We found three people with

1:13:27.834 --> 1:13:30.202
the right stuff.
>> I think you know who they

1:13:30.203 --> 1:13:31.437
are.
Ladies and gentlemen, please

1:13:31.438 --> 1:13:37.076
welcome the world's first
juggle‐naughts!

1:13:37.077 --> 1:13:40.245
Here they are!
>> There we go.

1:13:40.246 --> 1:13:42.214
Onkts, my goodness, our fearless
flight crew!

1:13:42.215 --> 1:13:43.949
They're ready.
>> Yes!

1:13:43.950 --> 1:13:46.445
It's time for liftoff!
>> Yes.

1:13:46.446 --> 1:13:48.153
It's time for liftoff!
>> Yes.

1:13:48.154 --> 1:13:50.089
We are gold for people juggling.

1:13:50.090 --> 1:13:52.391
.This is one small step for your

1:13:52.392 --> 1:13:59.865

Leave Howie up from there?

Honestly, that was one

That's one of the
year‐oldest things I've ever

For me, I think if you go

1:16:02.488 --> 1:16:04.990
through to the next round, and I
think there's a really good

1:16:04.991 --> 1:16:09.862

touch, I'm sorry.

Howie, what did you think?

- How did we look?
- Terrible.

1:16:31.050 --> 1:16:34.887

terrifying, because I don't like
not being in control.

1:16:49.469 --> 1:16:53.472
At all.
So that was quite scary for me.

1:22:56.254 --> 1:22:58.321
world can have a career.
And there is something so sweet,

1:22:58.322 --> 1:23:01.191
so charming about you, and like
I said, so real.

1:23:01.192 --> 1:23:03.627
Everyone was waiting for this
performance.

1:23:03.628 --> 1:23:07.798
I am going to predict we're all
going to remember the moment in

1:23:07.799 --> 1:23:12.269
years to come when we saw Grace
sing live for the first time.

1:23:12.270 --> 1:23:17.407
- >> Thank you so much.
- Heidi.

1:23:17.408 --> 1:23:20.465
Gosh.
I mean, Grace, you are so very

1:23:20.466 --> 1:23:20.711
gosh.
I mean, Grace, you are so very

1:23:20.712 --> 1:23:23.947
talented.
I can only say "save the best

1:23:23.948 --> 1:23:28.018
for last" and you're 1 in a
million.

1:23:28.019 --> 1:23:29.219
Mel b.

1:23:29.220 --> 1:23:31.755
I mean, you are just as
cute as a button.

1:23:31.756 --> 1:23:35.125
I just want to cuddle you!
You know what it is about you?

1:23:35.126 --> 1:23:38.595
You've just got one of those
voices that you remember.

1:23:38.596 --> 1:23:41.665
It's very distinctive.
But you know what I want to give

1:23:41.666 --> 1:23:44.501
you, I want to give you a big
boost of confidence, because you

1:23:44.502 --> 1:23:46.102
need to know exactly how good
you are.

1:23:46.103 --> 1:23:48.071

1:23:56.547 --> 1:23:59.316
my golden buzzer in life.
I've got to tell you something.

You are ‐‐ Simon said the first
time you're the next Taylor

1:24:02.386 --> 1:24:03.920

I predict that you're bigger

1:24:03.921 --> 1:24:06.022
than Taylor swift.
I predict that you are the

1:24:06.023 --> 1:24:09.292
biggest star to ever come out of
this show.

1:24:09.293 --> 1:24:11.394

1:24:11.395 --> 1:24:12.929
Grace vanderwall from time to

400 million people online are

1:24:20.238 --> 1:24:20.466

of America.
Everyone always is just waiting

1:24:31.949 --> 1:24:34.284
to see this moment.
Now the most important question,

1:24:34.285 --> 1:24:38.855
can you teach me how to play the
ukulele?

1:24:38.856 --> 1:24:40.357
- >> Yes.
- All right.

1:24:40.358 --> 1:24:41.591
Awesome.
