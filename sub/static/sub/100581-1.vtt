01:28.080 --> 01:30.376
You know what's the worst
thing about being dead?

01:30.400 --> 01:32.585
I got something.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.557
<i>You got too much
time to think.</i>

01:40.793 --> 01:42.867
<i>Thinking is painful.</i>

01:42.906 --> 01:46.128
<i>Knowing things is painful.</i>

01:48.667 --> 01:50.734
<i>See these trees?</i>

01:50.753 --> 01:53.376
<i>They know what's gonna happen.</i>

01:53.401 --> 01:56.447
<i>They know someone's gonna die.</i>

02:00.271 --> 02:02.774
<i>I was a regular girl once.</i>

02:02.805 --> 02:05.448
<i>I lived in a regular town.</i>

02:06.802 --> 02:10.185
<i>I dreamed of getting away
like all the other girls.</i>

02:11.760 --> 02:15.961
<i>But things go wrong,
as things will.</i>

02:18.080 --> 02:23.027
<i>Mines close..
companies go under.</i>

02:23.465 --> 02:26.021
<i>Marriages fall apart.</i>

02:26.421 --> 02:29.773
<i>Jobs disappear and
paychecks stop.</i>

02:31.454 --> 02:33.795
<i>But the kids are still there.</i>

02:33.826 --> 02:36.289
<i>And the bills keep coming.</i>

02:36.320 --> 02:39.174
<i>And you do what you gotta do.</i>

02:39.205 --> 02:41.607
<i>Or that's what you tell
yourself.</i>

02:41.861 --> 02:44.595
<i>You do what
you gotta do.</i>

02:48.182 --> 02:50.290
<i>But it changes you.</i>

02:50.293 --> 02:54.449
<i>little by little,
step by step.</i>

02:58.472 --> 03:01.860
<i>Soon enough you're running
with the devil himself.</i>

03:03.952 --> 03:07.596
<i>Soon enough you're cashing his checks.</i>

03:13.862 --> 03:17.871
- By God! Jackie O!
- Hey Bumpy!

03:17.902 --> 03:20.432
- Y'all coming over tonight?
- Hell Yeah!

03:20.491 --> 03:23.637
- Check day, ain't it?
- Exactly it is.

03:23.900 --> 03:24.637
Alright.

03:26.060 --> 03:30.041
<i>I'll come back later.</i>

03:32.553 --> 03:34.836
What'cha doing here sis?

03:34.867 --> 03:37.408
Coming for your annual perm?

03:44.266 --> 03:47.382
<i>Welcome to Pikeville, Kentucky.</i>

03:47.620 --> 03:50.242
<i>The town that never lets go.</i>

04:14.460 --> 04:17.127
- Oh, what in the hell?!
- Hi mom.

04:17.151 --> 04:20.528
You're still in your PJ's at
2 o'clock in the afternoon?

04:21.031 --> 04:22.900
Did you eat?

04:22.931 --> 04:25.786
- No?
- No? Why?!

04:25.995 --> 04:30.305
Why? Because Daddy's still asleep,
that's why.

04:30.336 --> 04:33.479
God dammit, Cash. This is
why I divorced your hairy ass.

04:33.510 --> 04:38.170
It is the middle of the afternoon
and the kids ain't 'et.

04:38.197 --> 04:40.290
And they're playing video games again.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.938
That is too damn violent for kids,
and even you know that.

04:42.969 --> 04:45.568
It is cartoons or nothing.

04:46.184 --> 04:47.920
- There you go, darling.
- Thanks, mom.

04:47.951 --> 04:50.484
Okay good girl.

04:50.485 --> 04:50.499
That's bullshit.

04:50.500 --> 04:54.792
You divorced me to get $86 dollars more
a month from the welfare.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.807
You wouldn't have to yell at me, Susie.

04:57.838 --> 05:01.694
The second you stirred beside me,
I'd be ready to rise and shine.

05:03.832 --> 05:07.991
That's your boyfriend hitting on me,
you dumb slut!

05:08.272 --> 05:10.955
And pay me my rent money, bitch.

05:12.419 --> 05:15.390
And I ain't your god damned Susie.

05:32.806 --> 05:36.005
You think I trust you alone in a room
with my percocets?

05:36.036 --> 05:38.275
They're yours now, huh?
Then why I gotta give you half my checks?

05:38.287 --> 05:40.323
- Don't start, Susie.
- To help with the kids?

05:40.354 --> 05:42.755
You don't even make them breakfast
and don't call me Susie.

05:42.786 --> 05:46.085
- I don't wanna hear it.
- I pick up the checks and I cash them.

05:46.116 --> 05:48.211
The hell kind of
contribution are you making?

05:48.242 --> 05:49.905
Gimme.

05:59.055 --> 06:00.963
Where's the other half?

06:01.015 --> 06:04.344
I cashed the West Virginia check,
and I ain't cashed the Kentucky one yet.

06:04.358 --> 06:08.216
- Why not?
- 'Cause there was a cop in the bank.

06:08.247 --> 06:10.428
- So?
- So?

06:10.459 --> 06:16.783
I don't like having no cop watching
me whilst, I'm perpetrating fraud, okay?

06:16.814 --> 06:19.346
You're not perpetrating fraud in Kentucky,

06:19.371 --> 06:20.852
you live in Kentucky.

06:20.893 --> 06:22.797
You're perpetrating fraud in West Virgnia.

06:22.828 --> 06:24.733
Oh, you want the money, you get it.
How about that?

06:24.764 --> 06:26.401
How about I stay in bed

06:26.402 --> 06:28.090
and you drive to all hell and gone!

06:28.121 --> 06:30.828
And I don't see your friend Joe B
kicking in no rent money neither.

06:30.859 --> 06:33.347
Why you gotta leave every sombitch
you ever know in the joint...

06:33.378 --> 06:38.965
I said... I don't wanna hear it.

06:40.128 --> 06:42.275
Okay?

06:42.305 --> 06:43.653
Okay.

06:45.301 --> 06:49.437
<i>There's only two ways to make money
in this town since the mines shut down.</i>

06:49.461 --> 06:52.097
<i>One's the funeral business.</i>

06:52.128 --> 06:54.638
<i>And the other's selling drugs.</i>

06:54.662 --> 06:56.662
<i>Sometimes I wish I was
in the funeral business</i>

06:56.686 --> 06:59.286
<i>All my life, all I ever wanted
was to get out of Pikeville.</i>

07:33.975 --> 07:37.320
<i>Why anybody'd wanna come here
from somewheres else</i>

07:37.350 --> 07:38.564
<i>I'll never know.</i>

07:38.594 --> 07:41.076
Agent Putnam
Hey, Todd!

07:42.330 --> 07:44.203
<i>First time I saw Mark Putnam...</i>

07:44.233 --> 07:47.624
<i>I thought he looked like
a picture in a magazine.</i>

07:48.026 --> 07:50.342
Welcome to our FBI outpost.

07:50.372 --> 07:52.721
Mark Putnam.
This my wife, Kathy.

07:55.624 --> 07:59.566
Like he's stepped out of a dream
when nothing ever went wrong.

08:01.597 --> 08:05.824
Like I finally take too much of something
and started seeing things.

08:13.011 --> 08:15.147
Would be nice to start
off with a bang, huh?

08:15.171 --> 08:17.646
Solve a big case.

08:17.917 --> 08:20.242
Even in a backwater like this.

08:20.273 --> 08:22.718
There's a couple of old drug cases
that Todd gave up on,

08:22.777 --> 08:25.625
maybe they'll let you take one
and run with it.

08:25.668 --> 08:28.593
There's also a bank robber
in the area.

08:29.543 --> 08:33.731
He's robbed eleven banks in four months,
and he's only gotten 21,000.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.907
That's less than a third of
the national average.

08:36.958 --> 08:40.422
I guess even the banks
around here are broke.

08:42.028 --> 08:43.837
on the other hand
he's had about three times

08:43.868 --> 08:45.660
as long a run than
the average bank robber,

08:45.690 --> 08:47.821
so he's gotta be doing
something right.

08:50.416 --> 08:52.432
What?

08:52.919 --> 08:56.327
I just like that
my wife knows all the relevant statistics.

09:00.159 --> 09:03.761
Don't just drop your clothes
wherever you take them off, Mark.

09:15.288 --> 09:23.269
♪ She's coming home...
my baby's comin' home ♪

09:27.328 --> 09:29.880
♪ Still have my soul... ♪

09:29.910 --> 09:36.921
♪ coming home, ♪

09:36.945 --> 09:38.945
♪ coming home ♪

10:01.572 --> 10:03.842
Put the gun down!
Get out of the car!

10:03.872 --> 10:07.067
Put it down right now!
Get out of the car!

10:25.004 --> 10:26.723
Who created this
filling system?

10:26.753 --> 10:29.702
Not me, and I'm not
fixing it either.

10:29.732 --> 10:32.218
I'm retiring in six months.

10:33.446 --> 10:36.783
I heard you were a file clerk
before you got accepted to the academy.

10:36.813 --> 10:38.634
Is that right?

10:42.067 --> 10:44.331
They say file clerks don't
make good agents.

10:44.361 --> 10:46.185
They do say that, don't they?

10:46.215 --> 10:48.668
Yeah. Well, they're wrong.

11:00.906 --> 11:02.746
FBI Pikeville.

11:04.526 --> 11:07.021
Why'd you show yourself, Deputy?

11:07.034 --> 11:08.523
As opposed to what?

11:08.553 --> 11:10.405
Letting him walk into the bank
with a shotgun?

11:10.436 --> 11:11.865
As opposed to waiting inside,

11:11.896 --> 11:14.103
as per the memo I sent your boss.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.497
We're trying to trap the man.

11:16.518 --> 11:21.332
With civilians in there?
That's nuts.

11:22.873 --> 11:25.533
I understand you didn't get
a plate number either.

11:25.563 --> 11:29.695
They wasn't no plate number.
They wasn't no plate.

11:29.725 --> 11:31.881
You recognize the vehicle?

11:35.919 --> 11:37.652
No.

11:40.671 --> 11:43.125
Well I guess that's it then.

11:51.217 --> 11:53.373
Whatta you want?

11:56.506 --> 12:00.444
I wanna be there when you interview
the owner of the truck.

12:00.475 --> 12:03.352
Look, It's better that than making me call
my supervisor in Covington and...

12:03.382 --> 12:06.292
Telling him I want to keep you
under 24 hour surveillance.

12:08.239 --> 12:10.375
Are you threatening me?

12:14.114 --> 12:16.123
Where y'all from anyway?

12:16.147 --> 12:18.156
Danville, Connecticut.

12:18.186 --> 12:20.321
Where's that?

12:20.351 --> 12:22.686
It's about an hour and a half
from New York city?

12:22.717 --> 12:24.572
You know, the center of the world?

12:26.308 --> 12:28.274
You gotta name?

12:28.277 --> 12:30.573
Mark Puntnam.

12:30.603 --> 12:33.120
Randy McCoy.

12:33.151 --> 12:36.696
- What, like the Hatfields and the McCoys?
- Yup.

12:36.727 --> 12:40.878
I got that family habit
of holding a grudge too.

12:43.742 --> 12:46.036
So how long you been working
for the sheriff's department?

12:46.085 --> 12:47.769
Since November.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.005
New sheriff's a friend of my mom's.

12:50.036 --> 12:53.264
A friend of your mom's?
That's how you got the job?

12:53.307 --> 12:54.888
Yup.

12:55.757 --> 12:59.278
How long you been a government man?

12:59.288 --> 13:01.901
About two weeks.

13:06.033 --> 13:09.226
First Yankee I seen
ain't afraid to get dirty.

13:31.807 --> 13:35.840
- Is that the truck?
- That's the truck! Get in!

13:46.252 --> 13:48.518
I don't get it.
Why would they bring the truck back here?

13:48.548 --> 13:50.331
Well they good ol' country bandits, boy!

13:50.361 --> 13:52.843
They just bringing the truck back
to it's rightful owner!

13:56.307 --> 13:59.624
- You okay, boy?
- Hell yes, you kidding?

14:02.921 --> 14:04.984
Hold on!

14:05.773 --> 14:08.258
Here it is!

14:12.155 --> 14:15.738
<i>All Mark Putnam Wanted
was to be a hero.</i>

14:15.768 --> 14:18.348
<i>It was his childhood dream.</i>

14:18.379 --> 14:22.255
<i>To be in the FBI and catch bad guys.</i>

14:22.579 --> 14:24.490
<i>You catch bad guys for a living</i>

14:24.521 --> 14:27.959
<i>then you must be a good guy, right?</i>

14:29.449 --> 14:31.950
FBI! Stop or I'll shoot!

14:47.254 --> 14:48.822
<i>Anyways, It was soon after that</i>

14:48.853 --> 14:51.675
<i>one of our dumbass customers
got into a fight.</i>

14:54.022 --> 14:56.689
<i>It was my little brother
Bones he fought with.</i>

14:58.721 --> 15:01.160
- You know this one?
- I'm trying to play cards.

15:01.190 --> 15:03.894
My baby boy! That's my boy!

15:03.924 --> 15:05.801
That's my brother right there.

15:05.831 --> 15:08.540
Give me my fucking money, bitch!

15:08.570 --> 15:11.396
- My money now.
- Fuck you!

15:11.426 --> 15:15.276
Get off my brother!

15:15.300 --> 15:15.305
Get off me!

15:15.306 --> 15:17.600
Stop it!
Get off him!

15:26.824 --> 15:29.520
You pick the wrong man
to mess with.

15:29.544 --> 15:32.815
What are you doing then?

15:32.846 --> 15:33.998
Get out!

15:34.022 --> 15:36.628
What're you doing?

15:36.852 --> 15:38.725
Wait, stop on it!

15:38.855 --> 15:40.915
Georgia, come on!

15:40.939 --> 15:41.658
Bones!

15:42.058 --> 15:44.411
Honey!

15:46.594 --> 15:47.740
Let me see.

15:47.770 --> 15:49.146
Keep the pressure.

15:49.170 --> 15:50.546
Son of a bitch...

15:52.897 --> 15:56.419
Shit.

15:56.443 --> 15:56.449
Shit!

15:56.450 --> 15:58.618
Honey, It's okay.
You'll be okay!

15:58.648 --> 16:01.258
Bones, sweetheart! Bones!

16:01.695 --> 16:05.059
Bones! Honey, wait..
No!

16:08.590 --> 16:11.166
I'll get him to the ER!

16:27.893 --> 16:29.148
Yeah, what's up?

16:29.470 --> 16:31.881
Local drug dealer's in trouble.

16:31.911 --> 16:34.338
Like to turn snitch
to get out of it.

16:35.281 --> 16:38.468
Your deputy told me to tell you.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.414
No, he didn't.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.759
Not in the middle of the night.

16:42.789 --> 16:45.279
He went off to bed
like everybody else, didn't he?

16:46.877 --> 16:48.741
You think if it been a few hours,

16:48.771 --> 16:51.151
we'll catch him
doing something stupid, right?

16:56.113 --> 17:00.046
<i>And Auburn with the rebound,
here they come the other way,</i>

17:00.077 --> 17:03.266
<i>and 9 to 12 guys are bringing it along
the side line...</i>

17:03.297 --> 17:06.063
<i>into the front court.
They spread out now.</i>

17:06.082 --> 17:08.438
Oh shit! Stay here!

17:08.469 --> 17:10.916
Where else would I go?

17:10.946 --> 17:14.025
It's your moron of a brother.

17:14.758 --> 17:17.881
Bones! Jeez, am I glad to see you.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.916
We told the cops
it was self defense honey, okay?

17:20.948 --> 17:23.798
- You don't got nothing to worry about.
- Good, It's true.

17:23.828 --> 17:25.981
They didn't believe that shit.

17:26.011 --> 17:28.233
Now come on in, honey.
What can we get you?

17:28.258 --> 17:30.258
He wants drugs.

17:31.564 --> 17:34.171
Good to see you too, man.
Is he dead?

17:34.202 --> 17:36.754
He's gonna be fine, honey.
He's in the hospital.

17:36.778 --> 17:39.278
I don't care what your sister says
there's $180 dollars here.

17:39.302 --> 17:41.302
That's $610 all together.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.826
The only reason I givin' it to 'ya
'cause you taking off.

17:43.850 --> 17:45.650
Right?

17:45.674 --> 17:47.674
One of those is for you.

17:57.604 --> 17:59.260
FBI! Open up!

17:59.282 --> 18:01.456
You've come back to
give yourself up, understand?

18:01.487 --> 18:03.882
Don't let no one in unless
they show you a warrant.

18:03.906 --> 18:05.802
Give it!

18:05.833 --> 18:07.446
Open up! FBI!

18:07.476 --> 18:09.569
Lose the straw, you moron!

18:14.171 --> 18:16.327
Open it!

18:20.194 --> 18:22.467
I have reason to believe
you're harboring a fugitive.

18:22.509 --> 18:23.938
We ain't harboring nothing.

18:23.968 --> 18:26.821
And anything you find without warrant
is fruit of the poison tree.

18:27.647 --> 18:30.312
Shit! Sorry, Susie.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.434
Okay, we're legal.

18:32.464 --> 18:34.817
- Over there.
- All right!

18:34.838 --> 18:36.293
Susie, Cash.

18:36.317 --> 18:38.261
How y'all doing?

18:40.640 --> 18:42.320
Move.

18:42.350 --> 18:44.067
Randy, wanna start
with the bathroom?

18:44.097 --> 18:45.353
Sure.

18:45.384 --> 18:46.803
- You all right?
- Yeah.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.282
Why don't you go sit down
there around the coffee table?

18:48.312 --> 18:49.692
I told you not let
anyone in unless

18:49.722 --> 18:51.004
they showed you a warrant.

18:51.034 --> 18:52.567
He showed me his gun, all right?

18:52.595 --> 18:55.262
I didn't mean that as a question.
I said sit down.

19:02.301 --> 19:04.405
Ain't you got
something to say?

19:05.183 --> 19:08.778
- I didn't start this.
- You can stop it, though.

19:08.809 --> 19:11.406
You want me to save
your dumb brother's ass?

19:11.421 --> 19:12.772
It's none of my business,

19:12.802 --> 19:14.912
but I'd be worried about
saving my own ass right now, Cash.

19:14.942 --> 19:16.454
Is that right?

19:16.485 --> 19:19.125
Well, the cocaine residue on the table
alone's enough to violate you

19:19.163 --> 19:21.148
send you back to prison for a few years.

19:21.169 --> 19:23.254
And that is if your wife
flushed your whole stash,

19:23.284 --> 19:24.507
which I somehow doubt.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.256
Been peeping through keyholes,
have you?

19:27.286 --> 19:29.007
Absolutely.

19:29.038 --> 19:31.245
Got a mirror in here.

19:32.821 --> 19:35.525
Looks like it was
used in a bakery.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.549
A big ol' bag of hillbilly heaven.

19:42.446 --> 19:44.467
Those are prescription!

19:46.081 --> 19:49.762
You got a prescription
for a thousand Percocet?

19:55.178 --> 19:57.813
He's got something worth
a lot more than that.

19:57.844 --> 19:59.920
He knows something that'll
get him a deal,

19:59.969 --> 20:01.768
and Bones one too.

20:02.397 --> 20:05.495
I don't wanna be a party
to nobody getting ratted out.

20:06.227 --> 20:09.042
Be quiet now honey.

20:09.454 --> 20:11.086
You know I don't make any deals...

20:11.116 --> 20:13.911
unless I got something in writing.

20:13.942 --> 20:16.088
What's that Cash?

20:16.115 --> 20:18.246
I said I ain't saying nothing

20:18.276 --> 20:20.602
until I get a deal in writing.

20:20.639 --> 20:22.753
Oh, you done this before, huh?

20:22.784 --> 20:25.318
He's done this
lots of times before.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.902
What do you say we leave Cash here

20:26.932 --> 20:28.177
think over his limited options

20:28.207 --> 20:30.019
and take the brother and the drugs out now?

20:30.040 --> 20:32.392
I say we can do whatever we want.

20:32.422 --> 20:34.100
All right.

20:34.131 --> 20:35.802
Bones shot that boy
in self-defense.

20:35.832 --> 20:37.163
That's a fa..act!

20:37.193 --> 20:38.891
You are the one who made...

20:38.921 --> 20:41.047
Get off me!
- I'd say you're on stronger ground when

20:41.077 --> 20:43.022
you try and talk your husband
into making a deal.

20:43.053 --> 20:46.248
- Oh is that right?
- Yeah That's right.

20:48.261 --> 20:50.204
You hear that, dickfor?

20:50.238 --> 20:53.258
Only way we're getting out of this
is if we make a deal.

20:58.164 --> 21:00.232
I got a smart wife too, Cash.

21:00.263 --> 21:02.734
I find it best to shut up and listen.

21:04.019 --> 21:06.121
Night-night.

21:09.395 --> 21:11.331
Okay, let me get this straight.

21:11.374 --> 21:13.210
You want a weekly salary.

21:13.241 --> 21:14.822
You want to be off probation.

21:14.852 --> 21:17.290
You want to negotiate the
size of your bonus

21:17.321 --> 21:18.951
for this information
before you tell us what it is.

21:18.982 --> 21:22.521
And if you testify,
you want to be in Witness Protection.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.451
That's it?

21:25.792 --> 21:29.282
You do realize that's
a lot to ask, right?

21:29.299 --> 21:32.405
And even if you were John Gotti,
that's a lot to ask.

21:32.436 --> 21:34.595
Well, I got a lot to offer.

21:35.661 --> 21:37.558
Who's John Gotti?

21:43.048 --> 21:46.997
All right. Uh... Entertain our guests
while I go speak to my boss?

21:47.022 --> 21:50.752
Yeah... I'll tell'em my fishing story.

21:51.643 --> 21:55.078
So me and my cousin Fred,
we was out noodling one day.

21:55.136 --> 21:56.176
Hey, you got a phone I can use?

21:56.200 --> 21:56.833
He's not a big guy,

21:56.863 --> 21:58.478
cause he's from my mom's side.

21:58.509 --> 22:00.195
In private?

22:02.937 --> 22:05.291
Grabs one by the lower lip,
pulls it out of the hole,

22:05.315 --> 22:07.200
wraps his legs around the tail.

22:07.231 --> 22:10.922
<i>Biggest god damn catfish I ever seen.</i>

22:10.952 --> 22:13.677
62 pound Flathead.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.103
- He reached in with his hand?
- Yeah.

22:16.153 --> 22:18.548
They was noodling, you moron.
Don't you listen?

22:18.579 --> 22:19.441
<i>Creekview</i>

22:19.565 --> 22:20.377
Who asked you?

22:20.429 --> 22:22.048
<i>Susan Smith?</i>

22:22.079 --> 22:24.769
- Yeah?
- Y'all got a call.

22:39.449 --> 22:40.708
Yeah?

22:41.587 --> 22:43.851
It's me, your sister.

22:44.536 --> 22:47.633
Something wrong with the kids?
<i>No, Just..</i>

22:47.664 --> 22:50.339
someone from the welfare
in West Virginia called.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.785
Shit.

22:51.816 --> 22:53.489
She was checking up on you.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.580
You're sure she's from welfare?

22:55.610 --> 22:58.717
<i>Yeah. She knew your case numbers
and everything.</i>

22:58.748 --> 23:00.603
All right. Anything else?

23:00.633 --> 23:04.257
No, I just...
thought you'd wanna know.

23:04.287 --> 23:07.985
Yeah, all right. Thanks.
See you later.

23:11.977 --> 23:15.244
Meet me in the parking lot
at the drive-thru at 7 AM.

23:15.275 --> 23:18.026
7 AM? Why would I do that?

23:18.247 --> 23:20.291
To get your brother a better deal.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.529
Keep your husband out of prison?

23:22.559 --> 23:25.673
Maybe get a little something
for yourself too.

23:26.018 --> 23:29.393
I don't want to talk to Cash anymore -
I want to talk to the boss.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.280
When he asks you what the call was about,

23:31.311 --> 23:33.434
say "None of your
business. You don't own me."

23:33.475 --> 23:36.245
Just like that.
That way I'll know you're coming.

23:37.602 --> 23:40.429
You sicced the welfare on me.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.334
Is there another option?

23:45.364 --> 23:48.177
Maybe ask for something reasonable?

23:48.208 --> 23:50.921
His god damned boss said no.

23:53.235 --> 23:56.049
I did say you're asking
for too much, Cash.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.813
Well, if you want to catch big fish,
you got to cut good bait.

23:59.843 --> 24:02.132
Did you really tell him
a fishing story?

24:02.168 --> 24:05.636
Yeah, but I didn't think
it would affect his mind, though.

24:05.695 --> 24:08.873
That's not funny, man.
I got a lot to think about here.

24:11.634 --> 24:14.289
Who was bothering you back
there anyway?

24:14.334 --> 24:16.856
None of your business.

24:18.754 --> 24:20.640
You don't own me.

24:26.341 --> 24:28.867
Are we done here?

24:29.341 --> 24:31.837
I could do with a cup of coffee.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.577
Waitress?

25:09.722 --> 25:11.661
God damn her.

25:31.306 --> 25:34.223
Here. This is for coming to meet me today.

25:51.197 --> 25:55.771
Nice ride.
Yeah?

25:55.837 --> 25:58.080
I inherited it from the guy
I replaced here.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.245
He just left for his new
assignment in Los Angeles.

26:00.275 --> 26:02.247
Lucky him.

26:02.778 --> 26:05.023
You're not a big fan of Pikeville?

26:05.054 --> 26:06.858
I grew up in a town about this size.

26:06.889 --> 26:09.145
Alls' I know is, every time I fall down..

26:09.169 --> 26:11.105
I end up rolling right back here.

26:11.129 --> 26:14.198
I figure that makes this
the bottom of the world.

26:15.043 --> 26:17.575
Well, your husband's negotiating
himself out of a deal

26:17.606 --> 26:19.627
that could get you both out of here.

26:20.350 --> 26:22.835
He always this hardheaded
about getting what he wants?

26:22.866 --> 26:25.248
He won my heart, didn't he?

26:25.279 --> 26:27.573
And you keep calling him my husband.

26:27.607 --> 26:29.493
He's my ex.

26:29.559 --> 26:31.619
Yeah, but you live together.

26:32.018 --> 26:35.046
We live under the same roof.

26:35.077 --> 26:37.656
But we're not together.

26:37.810 --> 26:40.102
I can see he's not smart
enough for you.

26:40.157 --> 26:42.155
He's a <i>dickfor</i>.

26:42.186 --> 26:44.523
What is a dickfor anyway?

26:47.819 --> 26:51.683
Well now.. I just got
to keep that in my

26:51.707 --> 26:55.570
little book of memories,
Mr. Hotshot FBI.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.523
I guess I should've seen that
one coming, huh?

27:02.576 --> 27:05.653
So what do you want most
out of life, Susan?

27:05.736 --> 27:08.020
Seriously. What would
turn your life around

27:08.044 --> 27:09.421
right now if it happened?

27:10.232 --> 27:12.702
You must think about it,
I certainly do

27:16.495 --> 27:18.237
Rehab.

27:20.961 --> 27:23.097
And money.

27:25.401 --> 27:27.606
Rehab and money.

27:34.765 --> 27:37.499
So you're a drug addict
who wants to get help,

27:37.530 --> 27:40.266
but you live with your ex,
who's a coke dealer.

27:41.350 --> 27:43.566
I imagine that must be hard.

27:43.590 --> 27:46.003
I didn't say any of that - you did.

27:47.616 --> 27:50.191
Why don't I tell you
what I really want?

27:52.383 --> 27:54.696
I know what you want.

27:56.342 --> 28:00.823
And I know what's a
Federal crime and what ain't.

28:04.731 --> 28:07.240
<i>That's the way the devil comes.</i>

28:13.262 --> 28:16.010
<i>He don't come to you as evil.</i>

28:21.300 --> 28:24.271
<i>He don't come to you on fire.</i>

28:28.790 --> 28:31.900
<i>He comes as everything
you ever wanted.</i>

28:36.086 --> 28:39.888
<i>He comes to you as you.</i>

28:41.566 --> 28:46.730
That's my poppy right there,
Hiram Grumbley.

28:46.761 --> 28:49.058
And on the other side

28:49.089 --> 28:51.731
is Cash's daddy, Amos G. Smith.

28:51.749 --> 28:53.627
Son of a bitch.

28:53.678 --> 28:55.517
So I remember you saying
when you fall down,

28:55.518 --> 28:57.584
you always end up back here.
Where'd you go when you fell down?

28:57.615 --> 28:59.805
You remember everything I say, do you?

28:59.806 --> 29:01.795
Yeah, of course.

29:04.180 --> 29:05.742
Pittsburgh.

29:05.772 --> 29:08.685
Me and Cash we lived
in Pittsburgh for a year.

29:08.843 --> 29:11.739
Why don't you tell me about
some of Cash's customers?

29:11.770 --> 29:14.505
And what they do for a living?
That kind of stuff.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.727
You mean what other crimes
do they commit?

29:17.736 --> 29:20.072
Crime that you can get
them jammed up for?

29:20.103 --> 29:21.804
Exactly.

29:24.712 --> 29:28.312
Mark, I'd be taking a hell of a big risk.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.999
These people don't fuck around.

29:31.030 --> 29:33.675
They find out you're a snitch,
they burn down your house.

29:33.706 --> 29:36.200
And that is just a warning.

29:36.225 --> 29:38.265
You keep doing it,
they will cut out your tongue

29:38.296 --> 29:39.596
and feed it to their dogs.

29:39.627 --> 29:42.181
That's why they'd be willing
to put you through rehab.

29:42.682 --> 29:44.898
Send you and your kids
to a new state somewhere,

29:44.922 --> 29:48.446
a new identity, a decent job.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.015
They do that?

29:51.040 --> 29:53.942
Yeah, they do it all the time.

29:55.212 --> 29:58.426
If you help me bring down the bank robber,

29:58.452 --> 30:01.372
I bet they would pay you ten grand.

30:01.403 --> 30:03.853
Yeah, ten grand.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.015
I'm not judging you, Susan.

30:06.024 --> 30:08.224
I'm just saying, you've never
tried to make a clean break of it,

30:08.225 --> 30:09.419
so don't give up hope.

30:09.450 --> 30:11.208
It's hope fucking me up.

30:11.238 --> 30:12.776
I understand.

30:12.807 --> 30:15.508
Here. Take this for now.

30:15.539 --> 30:18.294
Just remember, big risk pay big money.

30:18.325 --> 30:20.553
Small risk, small money.

30:21.556 --> 30:23.556
Okay?

32:16.773 --> 32:18.940
Pretty, ain't they?

32:20.830 --> 32:23.304
You want to hold one of the guns?

32:24.682 --> 32:29.620
They feel like... power.

32:29.651 --> 32:31.495
You know?

32:39.206 --> 32:43.266
Just make sure you read the papers
next few days, okay?

32:47.494 --> 32:50.365
Easy street's just down yonder.

33:03.916 --> 33:05.916
Come on!

33:09.723 --> 33:11.695
Damn.

33:11.970 --> 33:14.306
You ain't started to go
to the church again, have you?

33:14.330 --> 33:16.081
Why?

33:16.112 --> 33:19.885
You wouldn't care if I was being ordained,
Am I right?

33:28.242 --> 33:30.418
Come on, Susan.
You can't keep doing this.

33:30.442 --> 33:33.088
If you want me to keep paying you,
you have to give me something.

33:33.119 --> 33:34.216
Seriously!

33:34.247 --> 33:37.298
I've given you hundreds of dollars and
you haven't given me a god damned thing.

33:37.329 --> 33:40.945
I keep telling you,
my life would be in danger.

33:40.969 --> 33:43.673
I know that your life is in danger now,
isn't it?

33:47.384 --> 33:50.360
How long do you think
you can keep this up?

33:50.384 --> 33:53.600
How long before you find
yourself in jail or dead?

33:54.743 --> 33:57.032
Then, what are your kids going to do?
How are they going to live?

33:57.060 --> 33:58.458
You think the judge'll give them to Cash,

33:58.479 --> 33:59.812
or you think they'll wind up
in foster care?

33:59.842 --> 34:02.113
- You got a kid, huh?
- Yeah.

34:02.144 --> 34:03.848
A wife too?

34:03.879 --> 34:05.870
We're talking about you, Susan.

34:05.901 --> 34:08.541
Tell me what she's like.

34:13.556 --> 34:20.103
Is she young?
Is she pretty?

34:20.196 --> 34:23.108
Does she have a good body?

34:24.777 --> 34:27.484
She keeps herself fit,
If that's what you mean.

34:28.931 --> 34:31.460
I don't see she's too high-class for me.

34:31.491 --> 34:33.370
Is that it?
- No.

34:33.411 --> 34:37.306
Cause high class ain't always
so good in a woman.

34:37.331 --> 34:39.449
If she won't suck your dick
at the movies,

34:39.481 --> 34:42.578
then what the hell sort of good is she?
- Oh, come on. Stop it.

34:43.577 --> 34:45.456
Cash may treat you like
a cheap whore,

34:45.487 --> 34:47.466
but that's no reason to talk like one.

34:47.496 --> 34:50.063
Susan...

34:50.079 --> 34:52.289
You're the key to everything,
I want to do here,

34:52.320 --> 34:54.559
do you understand that?

34:54.632 --> 34:57.595
To me, you're the most important
woman in this town.

34:57.625 --> 35:00.012
For God's sake,
learn to act like it.

36:00.589 --> 36:02.432
His name is Joe B.

36:02.462 --> 36:05.587
My ex met him in prison.

36:05.617 --> 36:07.605
He lives with us.

36:09.178 --> 36:10.905
He has for four months.

36:10.935 --> 36:13.605
I didn't know how to tell you.

36:13.635 --> 36:15.635
I'm sorry.

36:20.051 --> 36:22.127
Outstanding.

36:23.892 --> 36:26.770
You've actually seen the shotguns?

36:26.801 --> 36:29.038
Susan, this is amazing!

36:30.780 --> 36:33.488
Oh come on, Susan. I can't do that.
You know that.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.781
Yeah, okay.

36:38.051 --> 36:40.880
He actually talked about
an upcoming robbery.

36:43.007 --> 36:44.504
God, I hate to say it but I think,

36:44.535 --> 36:47.415
we've got to let him go
through with this one.

36:47.445 --> 36:49.786
or else it won't mean a thing in court.

36:50.851 --> 36:52.794
Damn.

36:54.547 --> 36:56.699
All right, everybody!
This is a stick up!

36:56.730 --> 36:58.929
Get away from the door!
Come on, move it!

36:58.960 --> 37:01.958
Let's go, right now!
Right now!

37:01.988 --> 37:03.420
Hey, you fill that bag up with the money,

37:03.450 --> 37:04.819
and do it quick!

37:04.920 --> 37:07.262
You two!
Get the fuck out of that room!

37:07.292 --> 37:09.822
Right now, old man!

37:10.027 --> 37:13.001
And freeze! And put up your hands!

37:17.352 --> 37:19.993
Shit! Shit!

37:21.001 --> 37:24.834
All right, all yous!
Get there in that vault

37:24.865 --> 37:26.140
Come on!

37:26.170 --> 37:29.757
People help me so I don't
have to kill you now.

37:29.786 --> 37:32.839
All right. Now just give me
the rest of the money, old lady!

37:32.869 --> 37:37.774
All of it, let's go!
I don't got all day!

37:37.948 --> 37:40.592
Come on! Hurry up now!
Do it quick!

37:40.622 --> 37:42.153
I heard you!

37:42.197 --> 37:44.098
Come on, come on, come on!

37:48.169 --> 37:50.519
- Not all the way!
- Now I'm sorry I ruined y'all's days!

37:50.534 --> 37:52.106
Please!

37:57.606 --> 38:00.439
Come on, come on, come on!

38:03.020 --> 38:05.821
Ah, shit!
Ah, shit I'm shot!

38:06.824 --> 38:09.343
Oh, shit!!

38:09.505 --> 38:11.161
Shit!!

38:37.497 --> 38:39.057
Guess what?

38:39.087 --> 38:41.337
Joe B just robbed the First National Bank.

38:42.216 --> 38:44.754
You ready for this?

38:44.802 --> 38:48.381
Yeah.. Yeah, wha.. what next?

38:48.411 --> 38:50.314
Well, he's probably looking for a place to

38:50.344 --> 38:52.285
hide out. You gotta help me
figure out where.

38:52.316 --> 38:54.627
Okay?

38:55.158 --> 38:56.613
Okay.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.874
I gotta go.

39:02.900 --> 39:05.130
See you.

39:18.461 --> 39:20.225
Hullo.

39:20.255 --> 39:22.056
Hey, boy.

39:22.086 --> 39:23.923
<i>I got some money for you,
but, ah...</i>

39:23.978 --> 39:26.204
<i>It's gonna be hard to pass.</i>

39:26.858 --> 39:29.143
<i>It's covered in dye.</i>

39:29.173 --> 39:32.384
<i>You want it anyway?</i>
- No, everything's cool...

39:32.415 --> 39:36.611
<i>Umm... If you won't mind it's okay?</i>
Mm..hmm

39:36.642 --> 39:40.169
Why don't you give me that number for up
there where you're at, will you?

39:41.453 --> 39:43.279
<i>Okay,
here it comes.</i>

39:43.310 --> 39:45.110
Shoot.

39:55.134 --> 39:57.234
<i>I'll call you back.. call you back.</i>

39:57.264 --> 40:00.764
All right dude. We'll be looking out.

40:06.953 --> 40:09.315
What're you doing?

40:09.345 --> 40:11.345
What do you think?

40:37.049 --> 40:39.454
Mama, you don't gotta carry that.

40:39.512 --> 40:41.777
Georgia, Help the woman, will ya?
What's wrong with you, huh?

40:41.807 --> 40:44.241
Thank you.
- You're welcome, Gimme.

40:46.873 --> 40:49.326
- You'd better be right about this.
- Yeah I know.

40:49.356 --> 40:51.497
You've got three different
agencies involved,

40:51.527 --> 40:53.561
on the word of one drug addict.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.662
That's the kind of math
that'll get you fired.

41:10.186 --> 41:12.530
Joe, down!
<i>Joseph Beauregard Reevis!</i>

41:12.573 --> 41:14.857
Get Down! <i>This is the FBI
and the Kentucky State Police.</i>

41:14.888 --> 41:18.167
You're surrounded! Come out with
your hands up in the next 30 seconds

41:18.198 --> 41:19.886
<i>or we're coming in!</i>

41:20.063 --> 41:22.249
Shit!

41:26.337 --> 41:28.599
Okay. You take my mommy.

41:28.630 --> 41:32.445
You two hide in the closet.
I'm going out back. Okay?

41:32.476 --> 41:35.040
Gimme a minute to get dressed!

41:35.790 --> 41:38.262
Hold your fire, I'm going in after him.

41:44.154 --> 41:46.318
<i>Go.. Go, Go!</i>

41:49.423 --> 41:51.555
FBI freeze!

41:52.743 --> 41:55.382
Stop or I'll shoot!

41:58.584 --> 42:03.852
<i>Shots fired, reported shots fired
Shots fired 111 5th Street.</i>

42:16.817 --> 42:19.039
You cock sucking sons of bitches!

42:19.062 --> 42:21.931
In a fair fight I'd kick all
your fucking asses,

42:21.998 --> 42:24.510
You hear me?!
- No, no! Don't go!

42:24.541 --> 42:27.732
Get him in the car.
Get on the ground now!

42:27.773 --> 42:31.426
Get on the ground now!
Stay there!

42:31.457 --> 42:33.035
Son of a bitch!
When I heard that shot I damn

42:33.066 --> 42:36.112
near wet myself.
- Yeah, imagine how I felt.

42:36.143 --> 42:38.964
And then who got shot.. and by the
time you came around the corner,

42:38.995 --> 42:40.979
my heart was beating like a big bass drum!

42:41.021 --> 42:43.056
Well, you should've seen his face.

42:43.722 --> 42:45.948
Well, thank God for handcuffs, right?

42:45.978 --> 42:49.985
And when it started, when the lights come
on like... Phew!

42:50.043 --> 42:52.085
Yeah, that was pretty cool, huh?

42:52.116 --> 42:54.843
I felt like we were on the TV news.

42:55.002 --> 42:57.573
We did it, didn't we?

42:57.603 --> 42:59.603
Yeah, we did.

43:03.674 --> 43:06.239
We are a hell of a team.

43:07.714 --> 43:10.226
You deserve a reward.

43:18.800 --> 43:22.666
Did you ever come like...

43:22.696 --> 43:26.359
like it came up from your toes...

43:26.383 --> 43:29.720
and traveled through your whole body?

43:31.303 --> 43:33.020
No.

43:34.418 --> 43:38.684
Well get us one of those cabins boy,
and you will.

44:44.484 --> 44:46.566
Hey sweetheart.

44:47.604 --> 44:50.973
Kathy, Hi! Guess what?

44:52.623 --> 44:55.193
We got him. He's in custody.

44:55.796 --> 44:58.056
Hi, sweetie. Daddy's home.

44:58.086 --> 45:01.483
You hungry?
Yeah, I know, sweetie.

45:01.513 --> 45:04.426
God, did you got into a fight?

45:05.919 --> 45:09.645
Oh, no. It's nothing.
I got in a scuffle.

45:10.170 --> 45:12.764
Congratulations.

45:44.211 --> 45:45.791
Putnam residence. Who's calling?

45:45.822 --> 45:47.250
Miss Putnam?

45:47.280 --> 45:50.323
This is Susan Smith. I hope you
don't mind my calling you at home.

45:50.354 --> 45:54.408
<i>I'm looking for your husband,
but I can't say why.</i>

45:57.953 --> 46:00.209
I've heard all about you, Susan.

46:00.240 --> 46:03.280
<i>But I'm afraid Mark
isn't here right now.</i>

46:03.299 --> 46:05.565
He's out making friends
with the locals.

46:05.584 --> 46:08.659
Which I have to say is easier
said than done around here.

46:13.023 --> 46:15.429
Well shit, Kathy,
If you ain't got nobody to talk to,

46:15.464 --> 46:17.294
you're knocking on the wrong doors.

46:17.334 --> 46:20.327
Around here, the rich folk,
they got bugs up their asses.

46:20.358 --> 46:23.780
You wanna find yourself some losers
if you wanna have any fun.

46:24.736 --> 46:27.009
actually, that's true in Connecticut too.

46:27.015 --> 46:28.843
Is it?

46:32.415 --> 46:34.460
Listen, I don't wanna cross any
wires or nothing

46:34.490 --> 46:38.136
but do you wanna get a cup of coffee
or something?

46:42.027 --> 46:45.071
Hey, I mean.
If you don't want to, it's okay.

46:47.117 --> 46:50.877
No, no...
I think that's a great idea.

46:51.756 --> 46:53.598
Good.

46:53.629 --> 47:00.420
Okay, well, lemme just think of somewhere
that's... out of the way.

47:00.451 --> 47:03.663
<i>We gotta keep this on
the down low you know.</i>

47:05.073 --> 47:07.340
Yeah, we do, don't we?

47:09.022 --> 47:10.786
Yeah.

47:14.392 --> 47:18.284
Mark? God,
he's the straightest arrow I ever met.

47:19.108 --> 47:21.096
He told me that at this junior prom...

47:21.148 --> 47:25.019
His date took him out
to the football field to join her friends.

47:27.350 --> 47:29.697
And he ran. All the way home.

47:29.759 --> 47:31.895
Two miles.

47:33.628 --> 47:36.394
He already knew he wanted
to be in the FBI.

47:36.461 --> 47:38.470
It's the most important thing
in the world to him.

47:38.537 --> 47:41.787
Not more than you and the baby.
- Well, No.

47:42.836 --> 47:45.183
Well, I hope not.

47:47.512 --> 47:51.788
What about you? You
as straight as an arrow too?

47:54.034 --> 47:55.991
Not really.

47:57.189 --> 48:00.075
I got thrown out of Catholic school
for smoking pot.

48:00.149 --> 48:03.399
Than I discovered boys and
I really went on a tear.

48:03.430 --> 48:06.832
By the time I was 18,
My nickname was "Trouble".

48:06.863 --> 48:10.785
When I was 18 I wanted to be
a Playboy Playmate.

48:17.689 --> 48:20.557
I guess one day
I realized that all my friends...

48:20.588 --> 48:24.015
were growing up and I wasn't.

48:24.089 --> 48:28.266
They were all getting married
and starting families and..

48:28.620 --> 48:32.278
and I was still waking up with men
I didn't know.

48:32.309 --> 48:37.309
I decided it had to stop.
- Yeah? Well how'd you do it?

48:38.288 --> 48:40.926
I told my parents the truth.

48:40.950 --> 48:42.950
They sent me to rehab in Arizona.

48:42.974 --> 48:44.974
Paid off all my drug debts.

48:49.145 --> 48:51.323
And then I met Mark.

48:51.354 --> 48:54.366
And now we have a five year plan.

48:54.432 --> 48:56.319
We're going to stay here for two years,

48:56.350 --> 48:59.068
then get transferred to one of
the big regional offices

48:59.099 --> 49:01.888
with a little more room for advancement.

49:01.939 --> 49:04.968
Then we're going to have another baby.

49:05.019 --> 49:08.177
You made this plan together?

49:08.208 --> 49:10.600
So you're kind of a team.

49:15.134 --> 49:19.763
Mark told me that you want to
make a new start too, Susan.

49:19.821 --> 49:23.548
I just want to tell you
I think that's really great.

49:23.579 --> 49:26.149
I'd love to help you If I can.

49:29.248 --> 49:31.121
You don't want that, huh?

49:31.151 --> 49:33.727
No, I don't really drink anymore.

49:33.786 --> 49:37.249
I was going to order a Diet Coke
but you were too fast for me.

49:37.727 --> 49:40.029
You mind?
Oh, no!

49:49.209 --> 49:51.734
Oh you're making me crazy boy.

49:51.849 --> 49:55.235
I haven't felt this way
since I was 15.

49:55.929 --> 49:58.469
I could do this forever.

49:58.529 --> 50:01.468
<i>I couldn't get enough of that man.</i>

50:01.492 --> 50:03.392
<i>You could'a told me a 100
times he was into himself</i>

50:03.516 --> 50:05.716
<i>You could'a told me he was just a mirage
and when I got up close he would be gone</i>

50:05.740 --> 50:07.540
<i>It wouldn't make no difference</i>

50:07.564 --> 50:09.364
<i>I even liked the risk</i>

50:09.588 --> 50:11.688
<i>When we made love on his wifes bed,
that was intense</i>

50:11.712 --> 50:13.712
<i>It was all I needed to know</i>

50:36.149 --> 50:38.487
My dad was a truck driver.

50:40.029 --> 50:41.541
You should've seen his face

50:41.572 --> 50:44.281
when he found out
I got a scholarship to Pomfret.

50:45.865 --> 50:48.860
He told everybody about it.

50:48.891 --> 50:51.031
Even told his dispatcher.

50:51.062 --> 50:53.800
What's Pomfret?

50:53.809 --> 50:56.627
It was a private school
we couldn't afford.

50:57.883 --> 50:59.321
Even with the scholarship,

50:59.351 --> 51:02.683
he had to raise like a thousand dollars
a year to pay the extra.

51:02.858 --> 51:05.364
It was hard for him you know.

51:07.418 --> 51:10.186
That was the first time
he talked about me to his friends.

51:11.476 --> 51:15.154
I think it was the first
time he was proud of me.

51:16.289 --> 51:18.833
He loved you.

51:20.330 --> 51:22.150
Yeah.

51:23.676 --> 51:26.470
Then he had to go and die
when I was in college.

51:30.094 --> 51:33.091
I just wish he could've been there
when I got into the FBI.

51:33.109 --> 51:35.277
He would've gone crazy.

51:36.181 --> 51:38.090
You don't have to be perfect

51:38.121 --> 51:40.587
to get people to love you, Mark.

51:40.611 --> 51:42.411
Not to me.

51:42.635 --> 51:44.635
Hey what's the matter?

51:44.659 --> 51:46.759
I dunno.. I'm just drug sick and all.

51:46.783 --> 51:48.683
Have to get sober.

51:48.707 --> 51:50.807
You're doing great. I'm proud of you.

51:50.831 --> 51:53.231
You're are the only thing
that makes me get things done.

52:59.194 --> 53:02.650
<i>Of course I started thinking
I deserved better.</i>

53:08.434 --> 53:11.049
<i>That I should have been
the one by his side.</i>

53:14.227 --> 53:16.510
<i>Maybe I was pushing too hard.</i>

53:17.932 --> 53:20.853
<i>And then Denver Rhodes walked in.</i>

53:25.459 --> 53:27.628
One of y'all Mark Putnam?

53:27.659 --> 53:29.485
I am, why?

53:30.377 --> 53:32.892
I'm about to hand you
the biggest case of your life, boy.

53:32.923 --> 53:35.088
Two god damned tons of weed.

53:35.119 --> 53:37.705
You can close the drawer.
I ain't armed.

53:37.963 --> 53:40.458
You're best to take notes, boy.

53:40.482 --> 53:41.923
I got a lot to say.

53:41.954 --> 53:45.104
<i>He told Mark about a big
smuggling operation over in Stoneville.</i>

53:45.135 --> 53:48.008
<i>run by a crook named
Rufus Green.</i>

53:48.039 --> 53:50.352
<i>He was moving trucks full of dope
from Mexico</i>

53:50.383 --> 53:52.999
<i>and stashing them in a played out old
mine he bought.</i>

53:53.023 --> 53:57.199
Now this man just ain't interstate.
He's international.

53:57.262 --> 54:01.620
Now, I understand there can be some
compensational arrangements made?

54:13.316 --> 54:16.060
<i>Mark started working all the time
on that bust.</i>

54:16.116 --> 54:18.404
Yes, Your Honor.
I'm seeking a search warrant

54:18.434 --> 54:20.613
on the Cormorex coal mine in Medford.

54:20.644 --> 54:22.513
For all the buildings
and structures thereon,

54:22.545 --> 54:24.772
for all persons thereon,
for all vehicles thereon.

54:24.802 --> 54:26.356
I have attached three
kinds of supporting material.

54:26.391 --> 54:27.968
Rufus ain't fucking around.

54:27.998 --> 54:29.598
If he finds out I'm meeting you,
I'm dead, man.

54:29.629 --> 54:31.551
I'm going to talk to him.
I promise you that, Denver.

54:31.718 --> 54:34.077
<i>Show me a man who's working
all the time,</i>

54:34.108 --> 54:36.861
and I'll show you the woman
he's hiding from.

54:44.174 --> 54:46.964
<i>This is the single biggest case
this divisions ever seen.</i>

54:46.995 --> 54:48.446
<i>Listen to me,
I spoke to the Bureau.</i>

54:48.485 --> 54:50.123
<i>I think they're willing to go
as high as 30 grand.</i>

54:50.154 --> 54:51.339
All right.

54:51.369 --> 54:53.550
<i>Do you think you could stay in
there a little longer?</i>

55:02.367 --> 55:03.651
<i>Now, as we know</i>

55:03.669 --> 55:05.667
<i>Rufus Green works out of
an abandoned coal mine.</i>

55:05.698 --> 55:07.212
This is his headquarters.

55:07.213 --> 55:08.923
This is an overview of the entire compound.

55:08.954 --> 55:10.376
It's filled with many warehouses

55:10.407 --> 55:13.358
we believe could hold up to
5,000 pounds of marijuana.

55:14.400 --> 55:19.717
<i>And I will faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States</i>

55:19.748 --> 55:24.043
<i>And will to the best of my abilities</i>

55:24.074 --> 55:28.218
<i>preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States.</i>

56:00.943 --> 56:03.610
I told you. You can't come here.

56:05.565 --> 56:07.298
Where were you?

56:08.830 --> 56:12.237
I waited at the motel for an hour.

56:13.126 --> 56:15.052
I told you, sometimes things would come up

56:15.082 --> 56:16.619
and I wouldn't be able to see you.

56:16.650 --> 56:18.357
Okay? I told you that.

56:18.410 --> 56:20.143
Why didn't you call?

56:20.410 --> 56:22.585
'Cause something came up.

56:23.401 --> 56:25.133
Why didn't you answer?

56:25.163 --> 56:27.496
'Cause something came up, Susan.

56:29.011 --> 56:32.509
Susan, I can't always drop everything
for you, okay?

56:32.537 --> 56:36.580
I have a job.
I have a family.

56:36.611 --> 56:39.412
But I need you too.

56:44.023 --> 56:48.519
When me and Cash were in Pittsburgh,

56:48.543 --> 56:52.927
we knew a drug dealer
who had a cop in his pocket -

56:52.957 --> 56:54.957
a Captain.

57:03.218 --> 57:06.193
Now, you gotta look into that,
don't you?

57:06.298 --> 57:09.418
It would be a feather in your cap,
wouldn't it?

57:09.449 --> 57:13.964
To bust a crooked captain
on the Pittsburgh PD?

57:16.200 --> 57:17.578
When was this?

57:17.605 --> 57:21.248
Before I got pregnant by Cash, like a fool.

57:24.051 --> 57:28.054
All right, listen. We'll talk
about it some time, okay?

57:28.055 --> 57:29.873
When?

57:29.904 --> 57:31.500
I'll call you.

57:32.747 --> 57:34.447
When?

57:34.478 --> 57:36.832
Tomorrow. I promise.

57:59.440 --> 58:01.044
What?

58:02.276 --> 58:04.423
You have fun at the Red Clay Motel?

58:04.459 --> 58:07.365
- No.
- Bullshit.

58:07.436 --> 58:10.013
Bumpy said he saw you
coming out of there.

58:10.044 --> 58:11.572
I didn't say I wasn't there.

58:11.596 --> 58:13.762
I said I didn't have no fun.

58:14.065 --> 58:15.527
What did Bumpy do anyway,

58:15.541 --> 58:16.839
run up here and squeal

58:16.840 --> 58:18.597
so you can get him high, right?

58:18.628 --> 58:20.111
What are you...

58:20.142 --> 58:23.586
Why don't you go stay at your
boyfriend's house, wherever he is.

58:23.617 --> 58:26.624
You can't... You can't do this.

58:26.655 --> 58:29.755
If you come in here,
I'll break your fucking neck.

58:29.786 --> 58:31.961
No... No, Cash.

58:31.992 --> 58:33.983
Cash, you can't!

58:34.013 --> 58:36.320
You get the hell out of here!

58:48.538 --> 58:52.279
We have to let her stay Mark.
At least for tonight.

58:52.310 --> 58:55.210
Tomorrow she can move in
with her sister.

58:58.113 --> 59:01.806
We have to, she can't go home.

59:01.833 --> 59:03.824
I don't believe that.

59:03.833 --> 59:05.809
You think that she's making it up?

59:05.833 --> 59:09.564
- I wouldn't put it past her.
- She's not a liar.

59:10.215 --> 59:12.279
How do you know?

59:12.328 --> 59:14.894
Because I know that you'd
never take the word of an

59:14.925 --> 59:17.393
informant that you knew to be a liar.

59:17.417 --> 59:19.317
<i>I could tell he was pulling away.</i>

59:19.341 --> 59:21.341
<i>I figured I could reel him back in.</i>

01:01:30.742 --> 01:01:33.398
<i>And then I found out what
was really going on.</i>

01:01:33.422 --> 01:01:35.038
Can I tell you my news now?

01:01:35.062 --> 01:01:37.904
Sure. Sure, what's that?

01:01:39.702 --> 01:01:41.833
I'm pregnant.

01:01:49.892 --> 01:01:52.495
I'm due in March.

01:01:52.532 --> 01:01:57.092
Which wasn't part of the
plan but it's great anyway.

01:01:57.132 --> 01:01:59.694
What you think?

01:02:02.275 --> 01:02:04.581
That's... incredible.

01:02:04.605 --> 01:02:06.605
<i>I been fornicating like a long-eared
rabbit and Kathy gets pregnant?</i>

01:02:06.629 --> 01:02:07.929
<i>Shit!</i>

01:02:56.199 --> 01:02:57.984
Well hey, Susie.

01:03:04.186 --> 01:03:07.946
How y'all doing? How's Cash?

01:03:10.146 --> 01:03:13.054
Everything's okay.
Thanks, Rufus.

01:03:14.278 --> 01:03:17.014
Well, I hope business is good too.

01:03:17.038 --> 01:03:18.971
It's almost the end of the month.

01:03:30.664 --> 01:03:32.061
Now, what's got you so upset you

01:03:32.091 --> 01:03:34.695
had to come all the way out here
and tell me about it?

01:03:38.143 --> 01:03:41.906
The FBI is about to bust your
pot smuggling deal.

01:03:48.271 --> 01:03:50.200
And how the fuck would you know?

01:03:50.231 --> 01:03:52.486
Trust me Rufus, I know.

01:05:27.733 --> 01:05:29.351
We were up on the hill
watching the place,

01:05:29.364 --> 01:05:32.660
and just before dawn two trucks
came down going real fast.

01:05:32.684 --> 01:05:35.016
We couldn't get down here
near in time to catch'em.

01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:37.573
Yeah, I heard.

01:05:38.011 --> 01:05:40.252
We won't get all his connections, but uh...

01:05:40.283 --> 01:05:42.186
There's enough loose pot around here

01:05:42.222 --> 01:05:45.706
to make an interstate trafficking case
against old Rufus Green.

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:53.094
Sorry, Mark. It's not your fault.

01:05:56.662 --> 01:05:58.997
The hell y'all doing here?

01:05:59.016 --> 01:06:01.409
This is a crime scene, Mr. Green.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.425
This is my property.

01:06:03.679 --> 01:06:06.857
You wanna confess to
interstate trafficking now, Rufus?

01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:09.186
Or you wanna wait until
you're indicted?

01:06:09.216 --> 01:06:11.314
Now that'll be the day.

01:06:11.345 --> 01:06:14.606
Now, I ain't been up this way
in years.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:16.815
I got plans for this property,

01:06:16.845 --> 01:06:19.019
but I don't hang around here.

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:20.625
It's a dump.

01:06:21.012 --> 01:06:23.876
I can back him up on
that, officer.

01:06:23.907 --> 01:06:25.927
I ain't never been up here
before neither.

01:06:25.938 --> 01:06:28.169
We got photos of him here,
dumbass.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.116
- The fuck you calling dumb?
- And it's Special Agent Putnam to you, boy.

01:06:34.405 --> 01:06:39.022
Well then you got pictures of
your little girlfriend up here too, than.

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:41.505
That's right?

01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:46.208
What did you just say?
- You heard me.

01:06:46.212 --> 01:06:48.462
No, what did you just say?

01:06:51.271 --> 01:06:53.080
Go on, Rufus.

01:06:53.111 --> 01:06:55.630
He heard me?

01:07:41.139 --> 01:07:45.079
Mommy! Mommy!

01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:50.848
Mark. Somebody broke the window
at the side of the house.

01:07:50.878 --> 01:07:52.793
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:07:54.619 --> 01:07:59.751
Mommy!
- Shh, Shh, It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

01:08:14.148 --> 01:08:18.098
Okay, hang on you got it man
you got it?

01:08:21.367 --> 01:08:23.461
I try you go!

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.106
Mommy, Mom!

01:08:44.716 --> 01:08:46.272
Hey.

01:08:46.301 --> 01:08:49.683
Who are you expecting to call, anyway?
What do you mean?

01:08:49.714 --> 01:08:52.654
I mean you're guarding the phone
like you did when you were 13.

01:08:52.685 --> 01:08:56.339
I don't know. Nobody.

01:08:56.406 --> 01:08:59.653
Why don't you get out of bed and help
me with the groceries then?

01:09:02.645 --> 01:09:05.134
Sis, I gotta go.

01:09:06.581 --> 01:09:09.411
Ain't nothing good gonna come of that.
Of what?

01:09:09.442 --> 01:09:12.953
You know what, messing around
with that goddamn federal cop!

01:09:12.984 --> 01:09:15.001
I'm an important informant.

01:09:15.024 --> 01:09:17.513
One day I might disappear into
witness protection,

01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:20.545
so you better enjoy me whilst I'm here.

01:09:21.951 --> 01:09:24.446
You're gonna get yourself killed.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:49.194
Rufus Green sent somebody to burn down
my house last night.

01:09:50.541 --> 01:09:52.676
You don't blame me, do you?

01:09:52.701 --> 01:09:54.551
Yeah I do.

01:09:56.264 --> 01:10:00.092
I did not tell Rufus Green about your
precious drug bust.

01:10:00.123 --> 01:10:02.986
Of course you did, Susan.
- Bullshit.

01:10:03.469 --> 01:10:05.125
Jesus Christ, stop lying.

01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:08.005
My kid was in that house.
You put my family in danger.

01:10:08.029 --> 01:10:09.888
I did not.

01:10:11.742 --> 01:10:14.132
I got six grand in this bag
here for you.

01:10:14.142 --> 01:10:18.037
If you sign this receipt?
I'll give it to you right now.

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:24.226
I was gonna hold on to it until
after you testified.

01:10:24.306 --> 01:10:27.467
Then I realized I needed it to
get through this encounter.

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:33.283
This encounter's gonna be
hard for you, huh?

01:10:33.307 --> 01:10:37.275
No, It's gonna be hard for you.
I don't want to see you anymore.

01:10:37.306 --> 01:10:39.774
Do you understand?
Only unless I have to.

01:10:39.805 --> 01:10:42.220
What does that mean,
only if you have to?

01:10:42.266 --> 01:10:44.080
If there's blood on the ground, call me.

01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:45.219
Otherwise leave me alone.

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:48.247
It don't work that way, Mark.
It do not work that way.

01:10:48.278 --> 01:10:52.905
This ain't no way to treat your star
fucking witness!

01:11:47.882 --> 01:11:51.308
Hey Mom! it's a mustang!
How do you know what a mustang is?

01:11:51.339 --> 01:11:53.691
Everyone knows!
Everyone knows, do they?

01:11:53.722 --> 01:11:55.828
And my girl knows as well.

01:11:55.859 --> 01:11:58.059
And what do you think, mister?
Where the hell did you steal that at?

01:11:58.089 --> 01:11:59.663
I love it!

01:12:00.423 --> 01:12:03.926
I bought it.
With what?

01:12:03.957 --> 01:12:07.516
With half the four grand I got.
Im'ma give you the other half.

01:12:07.547 --> 01:12:09.321
Where the hell did you get four grand?

01:12:09.352 --> 01:12:11.003
I extorted that guy.

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:13.743
That guy from the Red Clay Motel.

01:12:23.263 --> 01:12:25.399
All right. Give me the money.

01:12:25.423 --> 01:12:28.391
Are we even?
What do you mean?

01:12:28.422 --> 01:12:30.610
You know what I mean.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.640
Are we even?

01:12:37.649 --> 01:12:39.840
Yeah. Give me the money.

01:13:08.064 --> 01:13:10.164
Why'd he give you the money, huh?!!

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:15.488
Because I shagged his dog! That's why!

01:13:20.587 --> 01:13:24.162
Watch your side here.
- All right.

01:13:25.222 --> 01:13:26.779
Lock it down.

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:28.781
Got it.

01:13:41.186 --> 01:13:42.909
Let's go.

01:13:58.301 --> 01:14:02.569
Don't. You have broken ribs.

01:14:03.434 --> 01:14:06.852
Ya kno..know... I spent several grand.

01:14:06.983 --> 01:14:09.544
I didn't mean for you to go and spill some.

01:14:10.009 --> 01:14:13.068
Tell you what, If I'd known you'd come...

01:14:13.742 --> 01:14:17.079
I would have kicked his ass
a whole lot sooner.

01:14:20.484 --> 01:14:22.263
Gimme.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.106
It's from Kathy.

01:14:34.572 --> 01:14:36.646
Oh God, Mark...

01:14:36.677 --> 01:14:41.122
You're the only man I ever knew
that's been good to me.

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:45.578
Lock the door, will you?

01:14:47.204 --> 01:14:50.493
I'm trying to stop
betraying my wife.

01:14:50.526 --> 01:14:54.179
And she thinks if I avoid you,
I'm betraying you.

01:14:57.845 --> 01:15:00.146
I feel like I'm letting everybody down.

01:15:03.882 --> 01:15:08.251
Susan, look you gotta stay away from Cash,
until the trial.

01:15:09.398 --> 01:15:11.538
I want you in good shape
if you gonna testify against..

01:15:11.569 --> 01:15:14.359
Please... I need you, Mark.

01:15:20.712 --> 01:15:22.998
More than ever.

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:34.605
If you don't, I don't know what I'll do.

01:16:07.234 --> 01:16:10.903
There. Okay?
You're gonna be fine.

01:16:10.934 --> 01:16:13.955
All you gotta do is tell the truth,
alright?

01:16:15.942 --> 01:16:17.474
Okay.

01:16:22.829 --> 01:16:25.071
You ready to meet your new partner?

01:16:26.193 --> 01:16:29.433
My what?
- Your new partner.

01:16:29.513 --> 01:16:31.966
Bob Singer, this is Mark Putnam.

01:16:32.793 --> 01:16:35.249
I don't like carrying rookies.

01:16:35.273 --> 01:16:38.878
You shouldn't have to Bob. You
are obviously carrying enough as is.

01:16:40.931 --> 01:16:43.450
Bob Worked undercover
drug in Baltimore.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.117
Tough duty.

01:16:45.148 --> 01:16:48.124
Somebody tried to kill him,
so the Bureau transferred him here.

01:16:48.148 --> 01:16:52.112
Somebody to make your little bank robber
look like a schoolgirl.

01:16:53.299 --> 01:16:55.659
If somebody tries to kill you,
the Bureau will transfer you?

01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:59.098
Of course. Think of the liability.

01:17:33.602 --> 01:17:35.422
Snitch!

01:17:50.867 --> 01:17:52.704
Raise your right hand.

01:18:00.223 --> 01:18:02.839
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

01:18:02.863 --> 01:18:05.911
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:18:05.942 --> 01:18:07.488
Yeah, I do

01:18:07.526 --> 01:18:09.366
Please be seated.

01:18:11.235 --> 01:18:14.751
How long have you known Mr. Reevis?

01:18:14.782 --> 01:18:18.569
Since he got out of prison
and come stay with us.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.735
Last year in the spring, I guess.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.969
The fall, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.915
I was confused. It's been a while.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.862
In the fall.
- All right.

01:18:32.931 --> 01:18:35.226
Could you tell us in you own words

01:18:35.274 --> 01:18:37.759
what you found in his room?

01:18:39.151 --> 01:18:43.043
He had a green dufflebag with two
sawed-off shotguns in it.

01:18:43.065 --> 01:18:44.646
And two black ski masks.

01:18:44.677 --> 01:18:47.171
Liar!
You are a liar!

01:18:47.585 --> 01:18:50.984
Thank you very much, Miss Smith.
Thank you for your courage.

01:18:51.183 --> 01:18:54.554
You've begun to make it
safe for a person in Pike County

01:18:54.585 --> 01:18:57.316
to go into a bank and
deposit their paychecks

01:18:57.317 --> 01:18:58.724
without being...

01:18:58.755 --> 01:19:02.045
<i>When a man tells you more than once
you're doing the right thing...</i>

01:19:04.308 --> 01:19:07.222
<i>It means you're doing the right
thing, for him.</i>

01:19:22.494 --> 01:19:24.789
Water heater's busted again.

01:19:29.812 --> 01:19:32.972
What, It's gonna take two of y'all
to fix the water heater?

01:19:33.003 --> 01:19:35.287
Apparently the FBI have rules
about male agents

01:19:35.319 --> 01:19:37.136
being left alone with female informants.

01:19:37.167 --> 01:19:40.430
That's funny. Nobody told me.

01:19:41.967 --> 01:19:43.992
Yeah, nobody told me either.

01:19:44.007 --> 01:19:46.004
And they damn well should have.

01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:50.289
<i>I knew Mark didn't have no use
for me no more.</i>

01:19:50.329 --> 01:19:52.717
<i>He'd already told me he had
turned his drug case</i>

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:54.640
<i>over to Fat Bob.</i>

01:19:57.956 --> 01:20:00.012
<i>But when I heard he was leaving town</i>

01:20:00.036 --> 01:20:03.785
<i>and he didn't have the guts
to tell me to my face?</i>

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:09.244
<i>Then I had to see for myself.</i>

01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:15.632
I been fucking your husband,
you know that?

01:20:15.656 --> 01:20:21.551
I said, I been fucking your
fucking husband, you stupid cow!

01:20:23.438 --> 01:20:26.517
Oh what, don't mean nothing to you?

01:20:26.561 --> 01:20:29.732
Don't that make you feel nothing?

01:20:30.057 --> 01:20:33.986
It makes me feel bad... for you.

01:20:34.444 --> 01:20:36.098
That you wanted a better life
so much that you

01:20:36.129 --> 01:20:39.917
thought you could just take mine.

01:20:39.948 --> 01:20:41.980
That's not gonna happen.

01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:51.839
Shit.

01:20:56.654 --> 01:20:59.442
<i>Anyways, everybody got what they wanted.</i>

01:21:00.414 --> 01:21:03.722
<i>Mark was the golden boy of the FBI.</i>

01:21:03.753 --> 01:21:06.138
This is Mark Putnam, everybody.

01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:08.099
He's broken more cases in his first year

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:09.514
than any two of you together.

01:21:09.545 --> 01:21:12.087
You want to learn how to be
meticulous and thorough,

01:21:12.118 --> 01:21:13.695
watch this guy.

01:21:17.184 --> 01:21:19.640
<i>Kathy got the big house,
and of course...</i>

01:21:19.664 --> 01:21:21.020
<i>Mr. Perfect.</i>

01:21:21.051 --> 01:21:22.992
Sold!

01:21:23.437 --> 01:21:25.828
<i>Rufus Green retired to Mexico.</i>

01:21:26.517 --> 01:21:29.653
<i>Denver Rhodes got 30 grand and blew it.</i>

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:34.560
<i>Fat Bob got to run the
Pikeville FBI All by himself.</i>

01:21:34.613 --> 01:21:38.297
<i>Even my dumbass brother Bones
got off with time served.</i>

01:21:38.438 --> 01:21:40.694
Me? Well guess what I got.

01:21:40.718 --> 01:21:42.662
Traitor!

01:21:44.512 --> 01:21:47.200
Get up, Susan! Get in there!

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:49.894
Come on, Georgia!

01:22:11.118 --> 01:22:13.218
Help... meee.

01:22:26.242 --> 01:22:27.942
Bitch!

01:22:34.606 --> 01:22:37.583
The day Mark Putnam come to town...

01:22:37.614 --> 01:22:40.898
is the day my life went to shit.

01:22:41.135 --> 01:22:43.803
You wanna do something about it, Susie?

01:22:44.966 --> 01:22:47.325
Like what?

01:22:47.355 --> 01:22:49.075
And don't call me "Susie".

01:22:49.105 --> 01:22:52.006
Like file an official complaint.

01:22:52.036 --> 01:22:56.190
The Bureau would take your
allegations very, very seriously.

01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:59.169
I look to you like the kind of person

01:22:59.199 --> 01:23:01.541
who gets revenge by filing a complaint?

01:23:01.593 --> 01:23:06.152
Well what do you want to do?
I'll help you do it.

01:23:06.183 --> 01:23:09.351
Whatever it is. I'll help you do it.

01:23:14.217 --> 01:23:18.221
You want me to take you to the ER?
- No.

01:23:29.655 --> 01:23:31.377
<i>I can send you the
report but it's gonna be...</i>

01:23:31.401 --> 01:23:32.430
<i>We had an undercover agent</i>

01:23:32.461 --> 01:23:34.128
<i>this is Agent Clark.</i>

01:23:34.152 --> 01:23:36.239
<i>Who is point on that now?</i>

01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:39.235
<i>I can't tell you who they are
I would be compromising the operation...</i>

01:23:39.265 --> 01:23:42.499
Illinois 9011. Yes.

01:23:43.045 --> 01:23:45.183
Registered to Mr. Abner Huggins.

01:23:45.213 --> 01:23:47.638
Address 141203...

01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:49.119
Lake Shore Drive.
- Hey, Mark.

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:50.570
You know someone named Susan?

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.798
Who may be a tad hostile?

01:23:54.625 --> 01:23:57.484
Yeah, I'll take her in the
conference room.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.895
Hello?

01:24:09.988 --> 01:24:13.706
<i>Hello? Mr. Perfect?</i>

01:24:15.153 --> 01:24:17.073
You know, you should have
been an agent, Susan.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.703
How'd you find me?

01:24:18.733 --> 01:24:21.247
<i>Cut the crap, Mark.
I'm pregnant.</i>

01:24:21.272 --> 01:24:22.713
<i>What're you...</i>

01:24:22.743 --> 01:24:27.406
Jesus Christ... Susan.

01:24:27.436 --> 01:24:29.505
<i>You wanna know what he said?</i>

01:24:29.521 --> 01:24:31.200
Are you sure?

01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:33.831
<i>He asked me if I was sure it was his.
Son of a bitch.</i>

01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:35.020
I'm not saying it like that.

01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:36.609
I'm saying are you sure it's mine?

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.664
<i>You find out what a man's made of
when you catch him by surprise.</i>

01:24:39.694 --> 01:24:42.091
Look, I'm coming back to court
in Pikeville in two weeks.

01:24:42.122 --> 01:24:45.177
We'll talk then. Okay?

01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:35.616
What the fuck took you so long?

01:25:35.647 --> 01:25:38.040
What?
I saw you park!

01:25:38.071 --> 01:25:41.746
What the fuck took you so long
to get up here?

01:25:41.777 --> 01:25:44.867
What are you talking about?
Oh I'm sick of this shit, Mark.

01:25:44.897 --> 01:25:49.224
You fucked me over. You piece of shit!

01:25:49.773 --> 01:25:51.305
How'd you even know I was here?

01:25:51.336 --> 01:25:53.601
Cause I'm staying here.

01:25:53.633 --> 01:25:56.517
In the Pikeville?
Who's paying for that?

01:25:56.548 --> 01:25:58.859
The FBI.

01:25:58.969 --> 01:26:00.924
You mean Bob Singer?
Yeah.

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:03.409
And why's Bob Singer paying for
you to stay in the Pikeville?

01:26:03.439 --> 01:26:06.587
Ah, so I can chew your head off,
that's why!

01:26:06.618 --> 01:26:08.444
'Cause he hates the fact that

01:26:08.475 --> 01:26:13.444
I fucked you and I
will not fuck his fat ass!

01:26:13.486 --> 01:26:15.468
I told you I'd make time this weekend.

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.447
I'm ready now.

01:26:17.468 --> 01:26:19.214
Well I'm not, Susan. I'm beat.

01:26:19.235 --> 01:26:20.773
And I gotta prep this drug trafficking case

01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:21.966
at the courthouse all day tomorrow.

01:26:21.996 --> 01:26:24.759
You know what, I should've killed her
when I had the chance.

01:26:25.886 --> 01:26:27.842
Killed who, Susan?

01:26:29.929 --> 01:26:34.846
I didn't mean that. Just slipped out.

01:26:35.889 --> 01:26:37.358
I mean, Jesus. Look at you.

01:26:37.388 --> 01:26:39.595
You're so stoned you don't even
know what you're saying.

01:26:39.626 --> 01:26:42.669
Fuck you, Mark!

01:26:42.746 --> 01:26:45.440
When was the last time you ate, huh?

01:26:45.471 --> 01:26:47.661
Have you eaten anything all day?

01:26:48.351 --> 01:26:52.526
Let me drop my bags,
and I'll take you to the drive-thru, okay?

01:26:52.556 --> 01:26:54.556
Okay?

01:26:54.586 --> 01:26:56.586
Okay.

01:27:11.524 --> 01:27:13.204
I ain't got no money.

01:27:13.284 --> 01:27:16.332
Everyone in this town wants me dead.

01:27:16.644 --> 01:27:19.109
What happened to witness protection?

01:27:19.882 --> 01:27:22.824
They gave me the cash
to relocate on my own.

01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:26.183
Okay, so what happened to that?
What happened to it?

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:28.207
I'm an addict whatta
ya think happened to it.

01:27:28.231 --> 01:27:30.231
You left me back there pregnant.

01:27:34.314 --> 01:27:37.793
What do you want me to do, Susan?
I want you to suffer.

01:27:37.882 --> 01:27:40.129
I mean, about the baby.

01:27:40.159 --> 01:27:42.789
Imma tell your wife about the baby.

01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:44.759
Imma tell the FBI.

01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:47.741
Fat Bob says they
will fire you on the spot!

01:27:47.799 --> 01:27:49.724
Fat Bob again, huh?

01:27:49.754 --> 01:27:52.384
You're everything he hates
about the Bureau.

01:27:52.402 --> 01:27:56.095
Bunch of candy assed
hypocrites wearing suits and ties.

01:27:56.110 --> 01:27:59.131
Well, he don't wear no suit and tie.

01:27:59.162 --> 01:28:02.047
And he don't fuck his informants neither.

01:28:03.566 --> 01:28:06.900
Susan, to be honest,
you don't look 5 months pregnant.

01:28:06.924 --> 01:28:09.024
They say drugs keep it small.

01:28:13.953 --> 01:28:16.458
Have you thought about getting an abortion?

01:28:35.486 --> 01:28:38.871
Can we please just try and have
a reasonable conversation?

01:28:47.312 --> 01:28:49.894
You were gonna save me.

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:52.008
I needed someone to save me

01:28:52.038 --> 01:28:57.088
and you were gonna be the one.
You even said so yourself.

01:29:03.664 --> 01:29:05.602
Susan, If I could drop everything

01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:08.077
and start again, I would.

01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:11.868
I'm trying to do the right thing.
I just..I just... can't.

01:29:13.903 --> 01:29:16.469
But the most important thing here
is the baby.

01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:18.269
What do you want to do about it?

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:20.790
Do you want me and Kathy to raise it?

01:29:20.903 --> 01:29:23.401
You and Kathy?

01:29:23.832 --> 01:29:26.480
I am a good mother!

01:29:26.511 --> 01:29:28.101
Come on, Susan.
Where are your kids now?

01:29:28.131 --> 01:29:31.112
You take that back,
you son of a bitch!

01:29:31.143 --> 01:29:33.087
How dare you!

01:29:33.471 --> 01:29:36.120
Susan! Get off!

01:29:43.831 --> 01:29:46.660
Christ, what the hell's the matter
with you, Susan?!

01:29:46.691 --> 01:29:50.974
You're trying to kill us both?
- Me? You're the one who's screwing me.

01:29:51.005 --> 01:29:54.397
I'll be damned if I'll watch you
prance back to Chicago

01:29:54.428 --> 01:29:56.581
with that stuck-up wife of yours.

01:29:56.645 --> 01:29:58.718
How about leaving my wife out of this,
okay?

01:29:58.749 --> 01:30:00.462
She's the only one who hasn't brought
this on herself.

01:30:00.492 --> 01:30:02.413
You fucked up my life.

01:30:02.444 --> 01:30:06.046
Oh, Jesus. Just tell me Susan
please! What is it that you want?

01:30:06.696 --> 01:30:09.741
I want you to have this baby with me.

01:30:09.772 --> 01:30:11.948
I want you to be there
when he's born,

01:30:11.972 --> 01:30:15.273
and I want you to sign the birth
certificate as his daddy.

01:30:15.304 --> 01:30:18.571
Second, I want you to
leave that whore Kathy

01:30:18.602 --> 01:30:20.350
and those stuck-up brat kids.

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:22.802
I swear, If you say one more thing
about my wife.

01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:24.733
Oh, what are you gonna do, huh?
You gonna hit me?

01:30:24.764 --> 01:30:29.205
Well go ahead. 'Cause men
have been hitting me my whole life.

01:30:29.284 --> 01:30:33.623
Jesus Christ, please, can we just try to
find a solution for our problem?

01:30:33.654 --> 01:30:37.185
Our problem? Your problem?

01:30:37.216 --> 01:30:39.162
I never been happier in my life.

01:30:39.193 --> 01:30:41.838
'Cause I... I told all my friends that,

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:45.315
Imma raise me an FBI baby.

01:30:45.346 --> 01:30:47.542
Oh my God. You're fucking nuts.

01:30:47.573 --> 01:30:50.317
Do you really think I'd ever let a kid
of mine grow up with you?

01:30:50.348 --> 01:30:53.985
Fuck you. Fuck you...
Fuck you to hell!

01:30:56.056 --> 01:31:00.047
<i>Well, that wasn't exactly
a meeting of the minds.</i>

01:31:05.834 --> 01:31:08.237
<i>At least he felt bad about something.</i>

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:10.247
<i>He couldn't eat.</i>

01:31:10.594 --> 01:31:12.694
<i>He couldn't sleep.</i>

01:31:19.676 --> 01:31:22.418
<i>For months he didn't know what to do.</i>

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.384
<i>Then all of a sudden, he did.</i>

01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:44.078
I need to tell you something.

01:31:45.446 --> 01:31:47.196
Now?

01:31:47.646 --> 01:31:53.117
Yeah. Before I tell anyone else.

01:31:53.139 --> 01:31:55.001
It's about me and Susan.

01:31:55.032 --> 01:31:58.236
Don't. It's over. It's in the past.

01:32:00.814 --> 01:32:02.566
It's not.

01:32:12.642 --> 01:32:14.255
All right, shoot.

01:32:19.408 --> 01:32:21.645
I'm so sorry, Kathy.

01:32:26.189 --> 01:32:28.357
It's worse than you think.

01:32:30.738 --> 01:32:33.261
Did you get her pregnant?

01:32:36.538 --> 01:32:38.583
Yeah.

01:32:54.577 --> 01:32:56.349
Kathy.

01:32:56.417 --> 01:32:58.093
Don't.

01:32:59.816 --> 01:33:01.592
I didn't mean don't have a drink.

01:33:01.616 --> 01:33:03.356
Good.

01:33:03.886 --> 01:33:06.163
I meant there's more.

01:33:10.416 --> 01:33:13.149
Jesus! Cut it out!

01:33:15.869 --> 01:33:17.485
Fuck you,
Fuck You!

01:33:17.515 --> 01:33:19.371
Fuck You!

01:33:19.967 --> 01:33:21.967
Fuck You!

01:33:32.843 --> 01:33:35.335
Stop! Stop it!

01:33:35.366 --> 01:33:38.239
You're not gonna win!
You're never gonna win!

01:33:48.116 --> 01:33:49.893
Stop it!

01:34:38.268 --> 01:34:42.470
It was an accident. I swear.

01:34:42.508 --> 01:34:46.106
It was an accident...

01:34:46.136 --> 01:34:48.862
why didn't you tell somebody?

01:34:49.554 --> 01:34:53.534
We were fighting.

01:34:54.295 --> 01:34:57.890
It was an accident while we were fighting.
That's manslaughter.

01:34:58.206 --> 01:35:01.027
I'm going to Washington today to confess.

01:35:02.875 --> 01:35:05.258
I have to.

01:35:05.275 --> 01:35:07.247
You have to?

01:35:09.542 --> 01:35:12.315
It's what my father would have wanted.
- Your Father?

01:35:12.346 --> 01:35:14.642
You're worried about your father?!

01:35:14.673 --> 01:35:16.679
<i>Course, I remember those last few minutes</i>

01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:18.813
<i>a little different than he does.</i>

01:35:45.994 --> 01:35:49.136
<i>But people only remember what
they can stand to.</i>

01:36:03.689 --> 01:36:07.624
Don't tell anyone. Not anyone.

01:36:09.467 --> 01:36:11.814
It can stay between you and me.

01:36:14.347 --> 01:36:16.642
I can live with this.

01:36:18.322 --> 01:36:20.281
I can.

01:36:25.688 --> 01:36:27.449
I can't.

01:36:31.471 --> 01:36:33.939
Baby, I've tried, I...

01:36:37.034 --> 01:36:39.035
I just can't.

01:36:40.988 --> 01:36:46.038
<i>By then, Mark wanted to be punished.
He thought he deserved it</i>

01:36:47.771 --> 01:36:50.421
<i>The average sentence for
manslaughter is six years.</i>

01:36:50.452 --> 01:36:52.262
<i>You serve two.</i>

01:36:52.398 --> 01:36:54.321
I'm sorry.

01:36:54.352 --> 01:36:56.717
<i>Mark took 14 and 13.</i>

01:36:56.748 --> 01:36:58.566
You're just doing your job.

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:04.763
<i>Kathy stood by him, or tried to.</i>

01:37:05.839 --> 01:37:09.135
<i>She died of drink about a year
before he got out.</i>

01:37:10.050 --> 01:37:11.426
Yes, I did.

01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:13.546
You did what, Agent Putnam?

01:37:13.570 --> 01:37:15.812
It's important that you be specific.

01:37:15.852 --> 01:37:17.460
For a second it sounded
like you meant to say...

01:37:17.490 --> 01:37:20.042
I did mean that.

01:37:20.071 --> 01:37:24.010
I killed her. I broke her neck.

01:37:24.768 --> 01:37:27.402
<i>He surprised a hell lot
of people around here.</i>

01:37:27.856 --> 01:37:31.183
<i>They figured somebody
I'd snitched on done it.</i>

01:37:32.488 --> 01:37:34.430
<i>He told them where to find me too.</i>

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.001
or they wouldn't have
had no proof or nothing.

01:37:37.123 --> 01:37:39.081
I got something!

01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:45.849
<i>Course he didn't decide
to confess until ten months</i>

01:37:45.879 --> 01:37:47.400
<i>after he killed me,</i>

01:37:47.431 --> 01:37:50.257
<i>so the dogs got at me pretty good.</i>

01:37:55.212 --> 01:37:56.868
<i>If I hadn't been so mad</i>

01:37:56.892 --> 01:37:59.249
<i>I would have had the baby by myself.</i>

01:38:03.172 --> 01:38:05.585
God damn you, Mark.

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:17.242
That's her.

01:38:30.569 --> 01:38:34.105
<i>I guess I was wrong about all them getting
what they wanted, huh?</i>

01:38:34.129 --> 01:38:36.752
<i>In the long run, anyways.</i>

01:38:38.265 --> 01:38:42.347
<i>Course in the long run, who does?</i>

01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:49.337
<i>Like I said.</i>

01:38:49.397 --> 01:38:51.947
<i>Worst thing about being dead?</i>

01:38:52.034 --> 01:38:54.834
<i>You get too much time to think.</i>
