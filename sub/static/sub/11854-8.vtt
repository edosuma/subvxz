WEBVTT

00:20.083 --> 00:21.792
You're going to sleep
with mama tonight,
okay?

00:36.625 --> 00:38.834
- Mama?
- Uh-huh?

00:38.917 --> 00:40.959
- It's dark.
- Shh.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.166
It's gonna be okay.

00:43.250 --> 00:44.583
Know why?

00:44.667 --> 00:47.417
'Cause mama says so?

00:47.500 --> 00:49.792
Yeah, 'cause
mama says so.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.000
Mama?

00:51.083 --> 00:52.458
Uh-huh?

00:52.542 --> 00:54.375
He's not coming
back, right?

00:54.458 --> 00:57.208
No, he's not.
Now, go to
sleep.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.291
- Mama?
- What, Toya?

00:59.375 --> 01:01.542
You don't gotta
cry no more.

02:18.291 --> 02:19.750
Kid dies on impact.

02:19.834 --> 02:21.792
Mother survives only
to lapse into a coma

02:21.875 --> 02:23.208
a few hours
after the attack.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.667
Going on two years.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.500
Two years in a coma?

02:26.583 --> 02:29.000
Just saw your boy Kite
at the courthouse.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.041
ADA Kite?

02:30.125 --> 02:31.417
Mm-hmm.

02:32.959 --> 02:34.792
That was, uh,
Billy Markins' job, right?

02:34.875 --> 02:37.083
Yeah, 33 years on,
then this hummer comes
in.

02:37.166 --> 02:39.083
They never got the doer.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.417
Dead kid and her mom
thrown out a window.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.208
How old's the job?

02:43.291 --> 02:45.041
2001?

02:45.125 --> 02:48.250
He asked about you.
Kite.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.208
Yo, pass the ketchup?

02:51.458 --> 02:53.792
Remember that picture
Markins had on his wall?

02:53.875 --> 02:56.542
Yeah. Mom and a kid
making a snowman.

02:56.625 --> 02:57.959
- That's the job?
- Yeah.

02:58.041 --> 03:01.166
The only case he left open
when he retired.

03:01.250 --> 03:02.625
What, so the assigned
worked it good

03:02.709 --> 03:04.083
but got nada for his efforts?

03:04.166 --> 03:07.166
His only
witness
was in a coma.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.458
Mm.

03:09.792 --> 03:11.250
What did he ask?

03:11.333 --> 03:12.542
Kite.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.417
Where you were.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.875
You getting a social life
going or something?

03:18.125 --> 03:20.333
No way.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.834
Good. This Miles case
has new direction.

03:22.917 --> 03:24.750
Yeah?
Why are we interested now?

03:24.834 --> 03:27.041
Because the mom just woke up.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.500
How long has she been awake?

03:32.583 --> 03:34.417
- Eighteen hours.
- She talking?

03:34.500 --> 03:37.041
'She has lucid but minimal
verbal function.'

03:37.125 --> 03:38.458
'She hasn't spoken
of the incident'

03:38.542 --> 03:40.625
'with her daughter yet.'

03:43.500 --> 03:46.125
Some people here
to see you, Ms. Miles.

03:46.208 --> 03:49.166
Hi, Rosie.
I'm Detective Rush.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.208
Detective Valens.

03:51.291 --> 03:53.625
'How you doing?'

03:53.709 --> 03:57.166
Rosie...we're here to talk
to you about what happened.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.834
- 'To you and Toya.'
- 'Your little girl?'

04:05.208 --> 04:07.834
- Toya.
- 'Toya.'

04:07.917 --> 04:11.333
- Is that what you're saying?
- Butterflies.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.125
Toya and...and-and butterflies.

04:15.208 --> 04:18.000
They hurt.
They hurt. They hurt, mama.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.500
Bruises on her.

04:20.583 --> 04:24.000
Toya had butterfly wings
and-and bruises?

04:24.083 --> 04:29.000
On her arms.
And...he-he bruised her up.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.333
- Who did?
- The man.

04:31.417 --> 04:32.542
What man, Rosie?

04:32.625 --> 04:35.917
The one in, uh,
the one in the bedroom.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.667
He would put bruises on her..

04:38.750 --> 04:42.625
...when she wouldn't smile
at him.

04:42.709 --> 04:45.542
Did you know him
before that night?

04:45.625 --> 04:46.959
What night?

04:47.041 --> 04:48.625
The night Toya..

04:50.250 --> 04:53.875
...the night
of the accident, Rosie.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.750
What accident?

04:56.834 --> 05:00.709
- Doesn't she know?
- I, uh...I'm not sure.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.250
Know what?

05:03.458 --> 05:05.542
What am I supposed to know?

05:40.709 --> 05:42.542
So bruises
and butterflies?

05:42.625 --> 05:44.583
That's all Rosie
remembers right now.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.083
Long-term memory's intact.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.917
But whatever went on
that night..

05:48.000 --> 05:49.792
Gone. She didn't
even know Toya was dead.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.083
Gone forever?

05:51.166 --> 05:52.583
If she gets it back,
it'll come piecemeal.

05:52.667 --> 05:55.291
Doctor says this type
of amnesia's emotional

05:55.375 --> 05:57.208
not physical,
so she should remember.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.959
The question is
does she want to?

05:59.041 --> 06:00.208
(Rush)
'Yeah.'

06:01.458 --> 06:03.750
Rosie said the man
in the bedroom

06:03.834 --> 06:06.625
bruised up Toya
when she wouldn't smile.

06:06.709 --> 06:08.166
Implying they knew him.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.709
Yeah, but the assigned
thought
the doer was a stranger.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.417
You trade thoughts
with Markins yet?

06:13.500 --> 06:16.625
Caught up with him between
tea times in Myrtle Beach.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.291
'His theory was
a burglary gone bad.'

06:18.375 --> 06:21.291
The doer's on crack, PCP,
breaks into the apartment

06:21.375 --> 06:22.792
'not expecting
Rosie to wake up.'

06:22.875 --> 06:25.458
She does, he panics,
and kills them both.

06:25.542 --> 06:28.125
911 call came in at 11:16 p.m.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.959
few minutes after Rosie and
Toya
hit the ground.

06:31.041 --> 06:34.000
Voice was a black male,
never ID'ed.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.291
Plus Rosie's landlady reported
a black male

06:36.375 --> 06:37.375
running from the scene.

06:37.458 --> 06:38.625
(Stillman)
'Black man hauling ass'

06:38.709 --> 06:40.959
through lily-white
Port Richmond?

06:41.041 --> 06:43.500
Stands out
like Vera in a bikini.

06:43.583 --> 06:46.792
Well, theory's decent, forced
entry, struggle in the
bedroom..

06:46.875 --> 06:49.250
...missing VCR.

06:49.333 --> 06:52.625
I don't know
what the butterflies mean.

06:52.709 --> 06:55.166
And I don't see
any bruises on Toya.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.250
Well, you find the man
in the bedroom

06:59.333 --> 07:01.417
I bet you'll get some answers.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.834
Case number 3579.

07:07.917 --> 07:10.625
I was Rosie Miles'
court-ordered supervisor

07:10.709 --> 07:13.000
'for, uh...for ten months.'

07:13.083 --> 07:14.709
Court ordered, Mr. Freely?

07:14.792 --> 07:18.458
Yeah, Rosie got a DUI
three years ago.

07:18.542 --> 07:19.875
'The judge didn't take
the kid away'

07:19.959 --> 07:23.000
'but he assigned me
to be her caseworker.'

07:23.083 --> 07:26.041
Rosie have a drinking problem?

07:26.125 --> 07:30.375
Pregnant at 17, dad's MIA
before her baby's born.

07:30.458 --> 07:32.500
'When she realizes all she's
got
to look forward to in life'

07:32.583 --> 07:34.750
is Pampers
and stretch marks

07:34.834 --> 07:36.583
she finds God
at the bottom of a 40.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.667
- She ever hit Toya?
- No.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.375
Ever notice any bruises?

07:40.458 --> 07:43.834
Never. No, the court would have
taken her away if she did.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.500
That's why
I was there for.

07:45.583 --> 07:48.291
You were at Rosie's apartment
the day of the murder, right?

07:48.375 --> 07:51.875
Yeah, we call them
unannounced home visits.

07:51.959 --> 07:53.792
Rosie's snoring,
TV's blasting

07:53.875 --> 07:55.667
kid's eating Ho Ho's
for breakfast, the usual.

07:55.750 --> 07:56.917
But you said
in your report

07:57.000 --> 07:58.458
that everything
was satisfactory.

07:58.542 --> 08:01.458
According to department
guidelines, it was.

08:01.542 --> 08:04.792
Did she have a boyfriend,
might've hurt Toya?

08:04.875 --> 08:07.000
I don't think Rosie
liked men all that much.

08:07.083 --> 08:08.834
- That a fact?
- I don't mean gay.

08:08.917 --> 08:13.125
Just, uh...most of these girls..

08:13.208 --> 08:17.375
...uh, will give it up for
a Big Mac and supersize fries.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.125
Hmm.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.542
But Rosie..

08:20.625 --> 08:23.250
...it was like she just
shut that door forever.

08:25.208 --> 08:27.750
Toya loved to draw.

08:27.834 --> 08:30.041
I never had the heart
to throw them away.

08:31.625 --> 08:33.834
You saw Toya and her mother
the day of the murder

08:33.917 --> 08:35.000
at a school play?

08:35.083 --> 08:37.375
Yes. We do that
play every year

08:37.458 --> 08:40.250
"The Flight Of
The Monarch Butterflies."

08:40.333 --> 08:42.458
The play was about butterflies?

08:42.542 --> 08:44.083
(female #1)
'It was, yes.'

08:45.500 --> 08:48.417
Can you tell us what you
remember from that day?

08:48.500 --> 08:52.083
Toya remembered all her lines.
She was the only one.

09:26.542 --> 09:29.166
Why was Rosie crying?

09:29.250 --> 09:30.709
I don't know.

09:30.792 --> 09:34.250
Did you ever see any marks
on Toya's arms Mrs.
Jablonski?

09:35.792 --> 09:37.625
Bruises?
Signs of abuse?

09:37.709 --> 09:40.667
No. We're trained
to look for those things.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.959
That's not something
you forget, detective.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.458
Two years is a long time
to remember.

09:46.709 --> 09:49.000
Toya always came to school
with a lunch.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.917
Clean clothes.
She was a happy child.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.500
Loved.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.542
That's not something
you forget either..

09:55.625 --> 09:58.291
...not around here.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.834
(Rush)
'So this is the bedroom
where the murder took place?'

10:00.917 --> 10:04.333
Yup.
No renter since Rosie.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.333
Except my brother.

10:06.417 --> 10:08.667
Comes from Poland, stays here.

10:08.750 --> 10:11.083
[dogs barking]
God. Shut up, damn dogs.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.750
Be quiet!

10:12.834 --> 10:14.542
Hate those dogs.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.166
That wasn't
in the crime scene photos.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.250
(Valens)
'Maybe a cable line.'

10:20.333 --> 10:22.125
Too big.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.834
And too high up.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.208
What happened to the bookshelf

10:26.291 --> 10:28.125
'that was against this wall,
Tammy?'

10:28.208 --> 10:30.291
Oh. My place.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.709
- Oh, yeah?
- 'Yeah.'

10:31.792 --> 10:34.458
I keep it for Rosie.
So what?

10:35.875 --> 10:37.542
Ever see any bruises
on Toya?

10:37.625 --> 10:40.041
Bruises?
No, no,
no.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.709
Rosie never
touch that girl.

10:41.792 --> 10:44.041
Never. Never.
Uh-uh.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.417
Maybe one of her boyfriends did.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.792
Says here,
you saw someone running

10:47.875 --> 10:49.000
from the building
that night.

10:49.083 --> 10:52.583
Yeah. Black.
He run and run and run--

10:52.667 --> 10:54.250
(Valens)
'Maybe he was
her boyfriend.'

10:54.333 --> 10:58.291
[laughs]
Right. When pigs fly.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.709
Rosie got a problem
with black men?

10:59.792 --> 11:02.792
No, I got a problem.
My building, my rules.

11:02.875 --> 11:06.834
Okay? Men at Rosie's that
night?
Yes.

11:06.917 --> 11:10.667
Black
No.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.917
Men at Rosie's?
What night?

11:14.166 --> 11:15.542
The night Toya falls.

11:15.625 --> 11:16.875
[spits]
I hear men voices.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.333
- The night she died?
- 'Yeah.'

11:18.417 --> 11:21.583
'In and out,
climb up, down the stairs.'

11:21.667 --> 11:24.917
You didn't mention that
two years ago.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.625
I see black run.
I told about black.

11:27.709 --> 11:29.208
Black did it.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.333
You see men come up
in this place a lot, Tammy?

11:33.417 --> 11:34.500
'No.'

11:34.583 --> 11:37.333
But one bedroom apartment,
come on.

11:37.417 --> 11:40.041
Toya sleeps on the couch.
I think.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.667
Wait, Rosie made her kid
sleep in the living room?

11:44.667 --> 11:48.041
So Rosie keep the bedroom
for herself for a reason, no?

11:51.417 --> 11:53.709
But I don't make judgment.

11:53.792 --> 11:55.542
'Like you are.'

11:56.583 --> 11:58.166
Like now.

12:00.792 --> 12:02.709
We got a uniform
posted at the hospital?

12:02.792 --> 12:04.625
Yeah.
No visitors for Rosie yet.

12:04.709 --> 12:08.000
- No family?
- Mm-hm. Parents are dead.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.458
This job ain't coming in, boss.

12:10.542 --> 12:13.166
- We got nothing.
- 'We got a witness.'

12:13.250 --> 12:14.875
Whose hard drive's been erased.

12:14.959 --> 12:18.166
"Bruises and butterflies,"
that's her big contribution.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.792
Well, it's more
than Markins had.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.625
How do we know
we can trust it?

12:21.709 --> 12:23.250
The bruises didn't pan out.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.750
Well, the butterflies
meant something.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.333
'Keep looking
at the bruises.'

12:26.417 --> 12:29.417
CSU figured out
the hole in the wall.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.709
Rosie's living room.

12:30.792 --> 12:34.083
The missing VCR
went on top of the TV.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.250
Okay, living room again.

12:36.333 --> 12:39.208
Missing VCR cables
must have run through this
hole

12:39.291 --> 12:41.875
'leaving these
tiny black streaks.'

12:41.959 --> 12:45.166
CSU says it's the same rubber
used in VCR cables.

12:45.250 --> 12:48.291
So the cable from the VCR in
the
living room connected to what?

12:48.375 --> 12:49.834
Something in the bedroom.

12:49.917 --> 12:52.041
I don't see anything it
could
have been connected to.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.583
Maybe because it was hidden.

12:53.667 --> 12:56.792
What do you connect
a VCR to if not a TV?

12:58.083 --> 12:59.667
A video camera.

13:01.667 --> 13:04.375
Why did Rosie have
a video camera in her bedroom?

13:05.500 --> 13:07.083
Was she making porn?

13:07.166 --> 13:08.834
Blackmailing someone?

13:08.917 --> 13:10.208
Doer's married,
having a fling.

13:10.291 --> 13:11.750
Rosie threatens
to tell the wife.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.041
Except Rosie's bank account
totaled a whopping

13:14.125 --> 13:17.709
$121 and 15 cents,
that spell extortion to you?

13:17.792 --> 13:19.834
On public assistance
you can't have more than

13:19.917 --> 13:21.041
a few hundred bucks in the bank.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.375
Well, that makes saving easy.

13:22.458 --> 13:23.959
Welcome to welfare.

13:24.041 --> 13:25.667
If Rosie was squirreling away
a stash

13:25.750 --> 13:28.875
she'd have to hide it real
good
or lose the food stamps.

13:28.959 --> 13:31.208
Check her belongings
for video tapes.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.208
You and Vera try pawnshops
in Port Richmond

13:33.291 --> 13:34.458
for the camera and VCR.

13:34.542 --> 13:37.333
If we find the tape,
maybe we find the doer.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.875
Oh. Real nice of Tammy
to let us in.

13:48.959 --> 13:52.375
Hmm. Real nice of her
to keep Rosie's furniture.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.834
How come
you don't like
Rosie?

13:57.917 --> 13:59.709
I like her fine.

13:59.792 --> 14:01.750
'Cause she got a DUI?

14:01.834 --> 14:03.250
With Toya in the car.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.417
Well, she shaped
up
after that.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.917
Paid the price.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.166
Only one that paid
was her kid, Scotty.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.875
Yeah, well..

14:13.000 --> 14:15.125
I think Rosie paid, too.

14:24.291 --> 14:26.375
Look what I found.

14:26.458 --> 14:29.375
Blank pages,
all of them.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.417
So?

14:31.500 --> 14:33.625
Wonder why this page
is missing?

14:36.583 --> 14:37.667
As luck would have it

14:37.750 --> 14:39.709
we purchased this model
six months ago.

14:39.792 --> 14:41.000
What's it do?

14:41.083 --> 14:42.250
Clarifies residuum

14:42.333 --> 14:45.208
otherwise imperceptible
to the naked eye.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.417
Talk down to me.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.083
It sees the imprint
from your missing page.

14:59.250 --> 15:02.667
It's the high-tech version of
rubbing a pencil against a
pad.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.750
Like that, yeah.

15:04.834 --> 15:07.250
Hope you got gloves,
it's freezing out there.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.458
Hmm. Any luck
in the pawn shops?

15:09.542 --> 15:11.125
Yeah, we tracked
a VCR and camera

15:11.208 --> 15:12.834
same make and model as Rosie's.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.667
Pete's pawnshop
in Port Richmond.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.041
- Huh.
- Rosie's hood.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.875
Guy dumped it
almost a year after the
murder.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.291
Heat was off by then.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.959
Petey's got a slip
for a guy named Angel.

15:21.041 --> 15:23.375
- No last name.
- Angel?

15:23.458 --> 15:26.000
- Yeah. Could be a dead end.
- Or not.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.917
Traced a missing page
from Rosie's address book.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.125
Disconnected pager number
for an Angel Rivera.

15:32.208 --> 15:34.333
Janitor at
Toya's school.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.083
(Valens)
'Angel Rivera?'

15:40.583 --> 15:43.333
Detectives Rush,
Valens.
Homicide.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.875
You know a Rosie Miles, Angel?

15:47.875 --> 15:48.959
A who?

15:50.208 --> 15:51.792
Wonder why she'd have
his pager number?

15:51.875 --> 15:53.125
He not knowing
her and all.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.166
- Maybe 'cause he's lying?
- Huh.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.750
Yeah. Whatever.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.709
So who's Jasmine Cordoba?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.500
- What's she got to do with it?
- That your girlfriend, Angel?

16:02.583 --> 16:04.917
Hear she pays your rent,
utilities, your car.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.709
You make your woman
pay the bills?

16:06.792 --> 16:08.458
Must be packing
some kind of punch

16:08.542 --> 16:11.125
in those baggies, huh, Angel?

16:11.208 --> 16:13.875
You wanna find out?
Make a move.

16:13.959 --> 16:16.625
'Cept Jasmine
ain't his girlfriend.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.375
- No?
- 'Nah.'

16:18.458 --> 16:20.875
- She's his mama.
- Ooh.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.375
She do your laundry, too?
<i>papi?</i>

16:23.458 --> 16:24.834
Help you make number two
on the potty?

16:24.917 --> 16:26.375
I live with my ma, so what?

16:26.458 --> 16:28.875
Your mother's here
illegally.

16:28.959 --> 16:31.458
We ain't gonna let
immigration know.

16:31.542 --> 16:33.583
You help us out.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.959
Me and Rosie, a few times.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.375
- 'It wasn't nothing.'
- She feel the same way?

16:41.458 --> 16:44.792
She wanted this, wanted that.
"Keep an eye on my kid, Angel.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.875
Make sure she don't fall
off the jungle gym, Angel."

16:46.959 --> 16:48.291
I was in it
for the sumpin' sumpin'

16:48.375 --> 16:49.792
<i>papi.</i>

16:49.875 --> 16:51.792
You seeing Rosie around the
time
her kid got killed?

16:51.875 --> 16:54.208
Nah. Kicked her
to the curb way back when.

16:54.291 --> 16:57.709
Hooked up with Gina.
Gave old white girl the boot.

16:57.792 --> 17:00.166
What were you doing in white
girl's apartment that night?

17:00.250 --> 17:03.417
We got your prints
on her video camera, Angel.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.166
You know,
the one you pawned?

17:08.917 --> 17:12.000
That day
her kid was...whatever.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.917
I see Rosie in the school.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.458
At Toya's butterfly play?

17:15.542 --> 17:17.834
Yeah. Crying and acting stupid.

17:41.375 --> 17:43.125
Rosie was making
a phone call?

17:43.208 --> 17:45.333
Yeah. Then she sees me,
hangs up.

17:45.417 --> 17:47.834
She starts blubbering in my
face
about butterflies

17:47.917 --> 17:50.542
and some guy's gonna hurt her,
blase blah.

17:50.625 --> 17:51.625
What guy?

17:51.709 --> 17:53.125
I don't know.
I told her to step off.

17:53.208 --> 17:55.417
You know what I mean,
not my problem.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.000
Rosie freaks.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.917
She starts shouting, screaming

17:59.000 --> 18:01.458
how she's got some tape,
us in bed.

18:01.542 --> 18:04.542
If I don't help her, she's
gonna tell Gina, blase blah.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.333
- Pissed you off, huh?
- Hell, yeah.

18:06.417 --> 18:07.709
(Rush)
'So you went over there
that night'

18:07.792 --> 18:10.208
'and taught her
a lesson, right?'

18:10.291 --> 18:11.792
Hell, yeah.

18:19.291 --> 18:22.041
- Mommy!
- Angel. Jesus.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.166
Get out of here!

18:25.250 --> 18:26.333
What are you doing?

18:26.417 --> 18:28.875
- 'Mommy!'
- You're scaring Toya!

18:30.375 --> 18:32.166
'Angel, get out of here!'

18:32.250 --> 18:34.208
(Toya)
'Mommy!'

18:34.291 --> 18:36.458
You gonna get me, bitch?

18:37.917 --> 18:39.500
Don't you hurt my mama!

18:39.583 --> 18:41.333
I'm gonna call the cops, Angel!

18:41.417 --> 18:43.583
No! No! Not that tape.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.667
[screams]
Not that!
Don't take that.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.875
Mommy!

18:47.959 --> 18:50.000
[screams]
Not that!

18:50.083 --> 18:52.125
And then I left.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.542
Truth is, I didn't care
enough
to kill them.

18:55.625 --> 18:56.709
Cared enough to hit her.

18:56.792 --> 18:59.000
I didn't hit her.
I pushed her.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.542
- Out the window?
- I didn't do nothing!

19:01.625 --> 19:03.792
I got the tape to prove it.

19:03.875 --> 19:06.291
- What tape?
- Tape from that night.

19:06.375 --> 19:07.500
I ain't on it.

19:07.583 --> 19:09.750
So that's proof
I didn't do nothin'.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.750
Nothing but pawn her VCR
and camera a year later.

19:15.834 --> 19:18.583
Where's this tape
you got, Angel?

19:18.667 --> 19:21.250
This was recorded
in your apartment, Rosie.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.583
It's a security camera.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.417
(Rosie)
'Who's that man?'

19:32.500 --> 19:34.500
That's what we were hoping
you'd tell us.

19:34.583 --> 19:35.625
I don't know.

19:35.709 --> 19:38.417
You remember
this camera, Rosie?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.166
You had it in your bedroom.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.667
I did?

19:43.250 --> 19:45.750
[sighs]
You remember someone
named Angel?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.834
You told him someone was out
to hurt you.

19:50.917 --> 19:53.750
'You asked Angel
for help that day.'

19:53.834 --> 19:55.834
If I don't remember who he is

19:55.917 --> 19:58.041
how am I gonna remember
what I said to him?

19:58.125 --> 20:00.083
We're trying to help, Rosie.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.625
What for?

20:02.709 --> 20:05.083
So you can get
your memory back.

20:05.166 --> 20:09.542
Like I said...what for?

20:12.709 --> 20:14.458
(Valens)
'Let's go.'

20:18.750 --> 20:20.291
It's not mine.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.792
It's hers.
It's Toya's.

20:24.375 --> 20:25.709
What's Toya's?

20:29.208 --> 20:31.041
The bedroom.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.792
It's Toya's bedroom.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.959
I remember that now.

20:37.917 --> 20:40.125
Why does Rosie put
a security camera

20:40.208 --> 20:41.959
in her daughter's bedroom?

20:42.041 --> 20:43.875
Worried something's happening
to Toya there.

20:43.959 --> 20:45.375
Nothin' in the autopsy report

20:45.458 --> 20:46.792
says anything
about sexual abuse.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.208
Well, maybe it was
just starting.

20:48.291 --> 20:49.458
And that's why
the camera.

20:49.542 --> 20:50.709
Rosie knew
what he was doing.

20:50.792 --> 20:51.834
She was trying
to stop him.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.750
And maybe
he's trying to stop her

20:53.834 --> 20:55.166
'from ratting
him out.'

20:55.250 --> 20:58.208
Ten Gs buys a lot of
"Don't ask, don't tell."

20:58.291 --> 20:59.709
I found a bank account

20:59.792 --> 21:02.250
'under Rosie's social
security
number and her name.'

21:02.333 --> 21:04.208
The assigned
missed that?

21:04.291 --> 21:05.917
Didn't exist
till three days ago.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.750
When Rosie woke up.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.041
Who set up the account?

21:10.125 --> 21:11.917
McLean Wyowski.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.458
Foreman,
Mills Lightman Construction.

21:14.542 --> 21:15.500
'No record.'

21:15.583 --> 21:17.000
What's his connection to Rosie?

21:17.083 --> 21:19.333
Wife's maiden name, Miles.

21:20.125 --> 21:22.041
Lorraine Miles.

21:23.458 --> 21:25.250
He's Rosie's dad.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.166
So Rosie tells you
her folks died

21:28.250 --> 21:29.667
and you don't check that out?

21:29.750 --> 21:32.000
With the number of cases I
got,
it comes down to triage.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.208
You keep a roof
over their heads.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.291
You keep the food stamps coming.

21:34.375 --> 21:35.375
So where do we look for

21:35.458 --> 21:37.709
suspected physical
sexual abuse, huh?

21:37.792 --> 21:39.417
Hospital admissions

21:39.500 --> 21:41.709
uh, foster care reports.

21:41.792 --> 21:43.458
All the miscellaneous stuff
we didn't get to.

21:43.542 --> 21:45.917
This
cabinet,
Mr. Freely?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.875
All of this.

21:47.959 --> 21:49.542
There are only
so many hours in the day.

21:49.625 --> 21:51.709
And so many kids.

21:53.125 --> 21:56.250
Yeah, how do we find Toya
in all of this?

21:59.917 --> 22:02.667
M...for Miles.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.083
Familiar territory?

22:06.166 --> 22:08.250
[sighs]
Yeah.

22:08.333 --> 22:11.667
Yeah, you knew that food
stamp drill pretty good.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.834
Case number 4228.

22:15.917 --> 22:19.375
Ellen Rush, two dependents.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.250
Valens.

22:26.333 --> 22:29.375
Who, McLean?
You bringing him in?

22:29.458 --> 22:31.291
Good.

22:31.375 --> 22:34.959
Jeffries and Vera just picked
up
Rosie's dad at the shipyard.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.417
What do you got?

22:39.500 --> 22:42.041
M for Miles.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.750
That's why Rosie
saw the bruises.

22:53.083 --> 22:56.083
That picture
don't look like Toya.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.333
It's not.

22:58.417 --> 23:00.083
It's Rosie.

23:06.417 --> 23:09.291
When was the last time you saw
your daughter, McLean?

23:10.500 --> 23:13.792
Five, six years.
Lost track.

23:13.875 --> 23:15.542
And you never visited Rosie

23:15.625 --> 23:18.375
all the time
she was in the hospital?

23:19.917 --> 23:22.500
Then why'd you set up
an account for her?

23:22.583 --> 23:24.625
You not givin'
a crap and all?

23:24.709 --> 23:27.583
I'm her pops.
I wanted to help her.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.792
Or shut her up.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.500
You know how
Toya died?

23:33.583 --> 23:35.834
Backbone busted to bits.

23:35.917 --> 23:37.291
'Skull, too.'

23:37.375 --> 23:39.417
'Oh, no open casket for her.'

23:39.500 --> 23:43.250
Violent guy who'd do
something like that, huh?

23:43.333 --> 23:45.250
I wouldn't know.

23:50.709 --> 23:52.542
Hit me.

23:54.750 --> 23:58.208
Show me what you did to
Rosie
when she was a little girl.

23:58.291 --> 24:00.333
Come on.
You like hittin' girls.

24:00.417 --> 24:02.333
'Hit me.'

24:05.166 --> 24:07.250
Gonorrhea when she was eight.

24:07.333 --> 24:09.709
Again when she was ten.

24:09.792 --> 24:13.709
You did a lot more than
just hit Rosie, didn't
you?

24:18.959 --> 24:22.208
Rosie made a call
at the school that
day.

24:22.291 --> 24:25.375
We traced it
to the shipyard, to you.

24:25.458 --> 24:28.250
What'd she call you about?

24:29.375 --> 24:32.083
Talkin' crazy,
like she was drunk.

24:33.166 --> 24:35.917
Goin' on about butterflies.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.041
And that someone was gonna
hurt Toya, right?

24:39.959 --> 24:41.500
So you went there that night.

24:41.583 --> 24:44.000
No. I-I went home.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.291
Tell them you went home.

24:45.375 --> 24:48.792
'After Rosie called,
begging for help.'

24:48.875 --> 24:50.917
- I did.
- Don't look at me.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.750
'Look at them.'

24:53.417 --> 24:54.959
'You tell Toya.'

24:55.041 --> 24:56.542
Tell Rosie.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.750
You tell them, not me.

25:00.500 --> 25:04.417
I-I-I sat outside her place
in the dark.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.625
And I-I didn't go there

25:10.709 --> 25:12.709
'cause I thought
she was in trouble.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.625
Then why'd you go?

25:14.709 --> 25:17.500
To tell her I was sorry.

25:17.583 --> 25:20.250
<i>For when she was little..</i>

25:20.333 --> 25:22.959
<i>...for what I'd done.</i>

25:31.709 --> 25:36.291
<i>I sat outside her place,</i>
<i>but I couldn't go in.</i>

25:39.875 --> 25:41.750
(Rush)
'So you saw some
pizza delivery guy'

25:41.834 --> 25:44.125
go up to Rosie's place.

25:44.208 --> 25:47.250
What'd this guy look like?

25:47.333 --> 25:49.500
Young guy.

25:49.583 --> 25:51.375
Black guy.

25:54.542 --> 25:56.959
(Rush)
'Did a black man come
over that night, Rosie'

25:57.041 --> 26:00.458
maybe...delivering a pizza?

26:00.542 --> 26:02.792
Maybe you were seeing him?

26:04.917 --> 26:08.709
How 'bout this, uh,
ponytail guy? Hmm?

26:08.792 --> 26:11.667
You starting
to recognize him?

26:13.959 --> 26:18.250
(Rush)
'Maybe you met him
at a bar...a club?'

26:19.542 --> 26:20.625
That wasn't me.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.875
What you're saying?
That wasn't how it was.

26:22.959 --> 26:25.875
Then tell us, Rosie.
How it was.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.959
Uh, Toya..

26:35.041 --> 26:37.500
...loved her...her

26:37.583 --> 26:39.542
butterfly wind chimes.

26:40.709 --> 26:45.583
I put 'em up in
a window...for her.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.583
Then he'd come

26:49.667 --> 26:50.834
at night

26:50.917 --> 26:52.834
'late at night.'

26:52.917 --> 26:54.834
Who would?

26:56.041 --> 27:00.000
The man who gave Toya
the wind chimes.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.959
(Valens)
They ain't optimistic 'bout
getting prints

27:04.041 --> 27:05.792
'off of them chimes.'

27:05.875 --> 27:07.750
- I know.
- Well, maybe we'd get lucky.

27:07.834 --> 27:11.166
(Valens)
If not...well, we'll get
somethin' else tomorrow.

27:11.250 --> 27:15.291
(Rush)
Yeah, well, maybe Rosie's
better off not knowing.

27:15.375 --> 27:17.208
Not knowing what?

27:17.291 --> 27:19.250
How she was with Toya.

27:19.333 --> 27:22.125
- How they lived.
- They were doing okay.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.709
What, on welfare,
with a DUI?

27:24.792 --> 27:28.041
People make mistakes.
They clean up.

27:28.125 --> 27:30.375
Your mom ever forget
to feed you

27:30.458 --> 27:34.417
'cause she was
too drunk...or tired

27:34.500 --> 27:36.083
or out looking for a man?

27:36.166 --> 27:37.625
Nah.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.375
Toya's a dime a dozen.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.750
Unwanted kid.

27:41.834 --> 27:44.542
Mom runs out of food stamps,
makes an excuse

27:44.625 --> 27:46.166
why there's
no dinner tonight.

27:46.250 --> 27:48.667
Oh, uh, no breakfast, either.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.417
So thank God for
the free corn flakes at school

27:51.500 --> 27:53.125
if you get there early,
and maybe some kid

27:53.208 --> 27:56.417
will give you scraps
out of his lunch box later on.

27:57.834 --> 28:00.000
So your mom was going
through bad times.

28:00.083 --> 28:04.375
Scotty...there was
never a good time.

28:04.458 --> 28:07.750
Are you telling me not once
did you have fun with your mom?

28:07.834 --> 28:11.500
I mean, not once did you feel
some kind of love?

28:18.166 --> 28:20.625
Maybe tomorrow
we bring Rosie home, huh?

28:37.208 --> 28:39.709
If you can't do this..

28:39.792 --> 28:42.458
No, I-I want to.

29:00.375 --> 29:03.875
<i>Mama. Mama.</i>

29:07.875 --> 29:09.792
She was drawing.

29:10.709 --> 29:14.125
She was...hiding
and drawing.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.875
(Rush)
'Why was she hiding?'

29:18.333 --> 29:21.000
Because he's coming
from there..

29:22.333 --> 29:23.500
(Rush)
'Rosie.'

29:23.583 --> 29:25.500
He was standing there.

29:25.583 --> 29:27.417
It's just Scotty.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.750
He's not gonna
hurt you, okay?

29:29.834 --> 29:31.917
He's not gonna hurt you.

29:45.792 --> 29:47.250
Lil.

29:47.333 --> 29:49.000
'Look at this.'

29:57.792 --> 29:59.959
Found our ponytail guy.

30:02.667 --> 30:03.917
"Frely."

30:05.959 --> 30:07.250
Freely.

30:08.750 --> 30:11.667
- Mr. Freely.
- The social worker.

30:26.709 --> 30:29.375
Cut your hair.
Big improvement.

30:29.458 --> 30:30.875
'Wanna see the rest?'

30:30.959 --> 30:33.291
I do. Play it.

30:40.291 --> 30:43.709
Okay. There's
nothing
on the tape.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.583
Rosie tried that bluff on you.

30:45.667 --> 30:47.625
- Didn't work, though, did it?
- I don't know what you're,
uh--

30:47.709 --> 30:49.750
'Cause you hadn't
done
anything to Toya.

30:49.834 --> 30:52.083
- Not yet.
- You were circlin', though.

30:52.166 --> 30:55.458
- 'Movin' in.'
- 'And Rosie knew it.'

30:55.542 --> 30:59.291
'Cause she was real
familiar
with the danger signs.

31:00.500 --> 31:04.375
Rosie's, uh...damaged goods

31:04.458 --> 31:07.417
if you haven't
noticed that already.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.792
You know what bugs me?

31:09.875 --> 31:12.917
This camera's been
in her place for weeks

31:13.000 --> 31:15.959
'but she picks this day
to go to people for help.'

31:16.041 --> 31:17.375
Why?

31:17.458 --> 31:21.583
What happened on this day
that was so different?

31:21.667 --> 31:24.458
- She caught you.
- That mornin'.

31:24.542 --> 31:26.709
Startin' your act with Toya.

31:26.792 --> 31:28.667
- That's crap.
- 'And she threatened you.'

31:28.750 --> 31:31.125
I have a tape, Freely,
back the hell off.

31:31.208 --> 31:32.458
Oh, and that pissed you off.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.500
Who was she,
talking to you like that?

31:34.583 --> 31:36.792
- So that night you went
back.
- No.

31:36.875 --> 31:38.625
You used your position
to get in her home

31:38.709 --> 31:40.792
and check out her little girl.

31:40.875 --> 31:44.125
Knowing the power you had..

31:44.208 --> 31:46.667
'...and Rosie
wasn't the only one.'

31:46.750 --> 31:49.375
You were like God
to these women.

31:49.458 --> 31:53.250
You had the power
to give, to take

31:53.333 --> 31:54.834
and you did.

31:57.375 --> 32:00.291
Like anyone gives a damn.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.750
'Trailer park trash.'

32:03.834 --> 32:05.834
Welfare queens.

32:05.917 --> 32:09.500
Like you care
what happens to them.

32:12.250 --> 32:14.333
(Rush)
'They care.'

32:14.417 --> 32:16.542
Anita Jones.

32:16.625 --> 32:18.333
'Carmen Torres.'

32:18.417 --> 32:20.041
Dana Matthews.

32:20.125 --> 32:21.208
'Leena Young.'

32:21.291 --> 32:25.125
All their pretty little girls.

32:26.709 --> 32:28.917
They're here.

32:33.750 --> 32:37.375
'They've come here
to tell us all about'

32:37.458 --> 32:39.959
'Mr. Freely.'

32:49.333 --> 32:52.125
You wanna talk before they do?

32:59.875 --> 33:01.875
Rosie, uh..

33:01.959 --> 33:05.333
...threatened me
that morning.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.875
But not with any tape.

33:16.583 --> 33:18.458
Hello, little girl.

33:23.667 --> 33:24.875
Where's your mommy?

33:24.959 --> 33:26.208
Shower.

33:27.041 --> 33:28.250
Mommy.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.208
That's, uh..

33:31.291 --> 33:33.834
...good little girls
don't yell, Toya.

33:41.166 --> 33:44.458
Mommy says nobody
can come in here.

33:44.542 --> 33:47.041
Well, Mr. Freely can.

34:01.166 --> 34:03.333
'You look pretty, Toya.'

34:03.417 --> 34:04.792
Okay.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.125
Uh-uh.

34:08.792 --> 34:10.125
Say..

34:10.208 --> 34:12.500
...thank you, Mr. Freely.

34:13.709 --> 34:16.250
(Toya)
'Thank you, Mr. Freely.'

34:23.208 --> 34:25.375
You're a
good,
good girl.

34:26.792 --> 34:30.542
Don't you touch her!
I know what you're doing.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.750
I know what you are!

34:35.375 --> 34:37.792
You been drinking? I can smell
it on your breath, Rosie.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.500
Get out.
Get out of my house.

34:39.583 --> 34:41.500
'Judge isn't gonna look
too kindly on that, you
know.'

34:41.583 --> 34:43.625
Not with a DUI and all.

34:43.709 --> 34:45.583
You know I stopped.
I told you--

34:45.667 --> 34:48.166
I tell you!
You don't tell me!

34:48.250 --> 34:50.375
You drunk, dumb bitch!

34:52.750 --> 34:54.667
What?

34:54.750 --> 34:56.458
Oh, it's, um, it's, uh..

34:56.542 --> 34:58.667
It's a good
thing
I came here.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.250
'Oh, this place is a wreck!

35:00.333 --> 35:03.333
'How do you raise
a child in this filth?'

35:03.417 --> 35:05.083
Okay.

35:05.166 --> 35:06.875
I was wrong, Mr. Freely.

35:06.959 --> 35:08.417
'I was wrong.'

35:09.250 --> 35:12.583
I've made my decision.

35:12.667 --> 35:15.834
It's time to find
a new home for Toya.

35:15.917 --> 35:17.291
No.

35:17.375 --> 35:18.834
I'm gonna have
to take care

35:18.917 --> 35:21.667
of that pretty
little girl..

35:21.750 --> 35:23.500
...all by myself.

35:32.750 --> 35:36.500
You just wait for the knock
on the door, Rosie.

35:36.583 --> 35:39.041
When you least expect it.

35:44.959 --> 35:48.542
That's all I did.
And then I left.

35:48.625 --> 35:50.041
Talk about that night, Freely.

35:50.125 --> 35:52.583
- When you went back.
- It's, I wasn't there.

35:52.667 --> 35:54.667
I hate a liar, man.

35:57.458 --> 35:59.542
Something you wanna see.

36:03.083 --> 36:06.375
No prints on the chimes,
but look at this.

36:06.458 --> 36:07.792
(Rush)
"P. Williams?"

36:07.875 --> 36:10.041
- Who's that?
- Philip Williams.

36:10.125 --> 36:11.375
Sixteen
at the time of the murder.

36:11.458 --> 36:12.709
He worked at Toya's school.

36:12.792 --> 36:14.709
Doing arts and crafts
with the first graders.

36:14.792 --> 36:16.417
Making wind chimes.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.333
Doesn't mean
we got the wrong guy.

36:18.417 --> 36:20.583
He worked as a
pizza delivery
boy.

36:20.667 --> 36:25.166
The guy the father saw
that night, dialing 911

36:25.250 --> 36:27.792
'running from the scene.'

36:40.625 --> 36:42.458
Philip Williams?

36:42.542 --> 36:44.625
'Detectives Rush, Valens.'

36:44.709 --> 36:46.417
'Homicide.'

36:47.709 --> 36:50.458
I was wondering
when you'd come.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.875
You gonna arrest me
this very minute

37:00.959 --> 37:02.291
or can I finish this play?

37:02.375 --> 37:05.000
Why do you think
we're here to arrest you?

37:06.083 --> 37:08.250
Murder one,
second degree murder

37:08.333 --> 37:09.959
attempted murder, you pick.

37:10.041 --> 37:12.166
Ends up in the same place.

37:14.875 --> 37:17.375
Did you kill Toya, Philip?

37:17.458 --> 37:19.250
Looks like it, doesn't it?

37:19.333 --> 37:20.834
Then why call 911?

37:20.917 --> 37:23.125
If you didn't do it,
why not come forward?

37:23.208 --> 37:25.208
A black man running
from the bodies

37:25.291 --> 37:27.458
of a white woman
and white child..

37:27.542 --> 37:29.291
Would you?

37:29.375 --> 37:30.917
What happened to you, Philip?

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
A student, honor society,
budding artist.

37:34.083 --> 37:36.750
Then Toya Miles dies
and you end up here.

37:36.834 --> 37:40.041
- At the bottom of the world.
- What happened that night?

37:40.125 --> 37:43.166
Brought you to a place
you don't belong.

37:46.583 --> 37:47.875
Leftovers.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.500
They'd throw them out
at the pizza place.

37:54.417 --> 37:58.333
I'd bring them over to
Toya,
from time to time.

37:58.417 --> 38:00.250
<i>That night, I went over.</i>

38:00.333 --> 38:03.583
<i>Rosie's apartment door</i>
<i>was busted open.</i>

38:42.000 --> 38:44.583
What happened then?

38:46.750 --> 38:49.375
I opened the bedroom door.

39:02.333 --> 39:04.583
Who was in the bedroom?

39:05.875 --> 39:08.291
Who was there, Philip?

39:19.583 --> 39:21.500
<i>(Philip)</i>
<i>No one.</i>

39:22.959 --> 39:24.500
No one.

39:34.834 --> 39:38.750
Hospital says
I'm okay to go home.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.583
I know.

39:44.208 --> 39:46.291
But where's home?

39:52.709 --> 39:55.500
I know why you were crying
at the butterfly play.

40:00.208 --> 40:03.000
Because you tried
to stop Mr. Freely.

40:04.875 --> 40:07.542
But you knew you couldn't.

40:09.041 --> 40:12.000
'Cause men like him never stop.

40:12.750 --> 40:14.333
No, they don't.

40:19.166 --> 40:21.667
No one was there for you.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.667
Not your dad

40:23.750 --> 40:25.667
not Angel.

40:27.291 --> 40:28.750
Just you.

40:33.375 --> 40:36.625
So you did the only thing
you could.

40:37.583 --> 40:39.208
I did?

40:39.291 --> 40:41.959
(Rush)
'Is that why
you can't remember?'

40:45.750 --> 40:48.166
The DA won't press charges

40:48.250 --> 40:51.000
not after
what you've gone through.

40:58.583 --> 41:00.875
What did I do?

41:03.500 --> 41:05.959
(Rush)
'There's a place
for you to go.'

41:07.667 --> 41:09.458
To heal.

41:11.333 --> 41:14.375
Just for a little while,
Rosie..

41:17.625 --> 41:19.792
...because you didn't mean

41:19.875 --> 41:21.583
'what you did.'

41:26.000 --> 41:28.041
What did I do?

41:57.083 --> 41:58.333
Mama?

42:00.709 --> 42:02.250
You just wait

42:02.333 --> 42:05.333
for that knock
at the door, Rosie.

42:05.417 --> 42:07.458
When you least expect it.

42:07.542 --> 42:08.583
Mommy?

42:08.667 --> 42:09.959
Yeah.

42:11.875 --> 42:13.125
'Mommy?'

42:22.375 --> 42:24.583
- Mommy?
- You sing. Sing, baby.

42:24.667 --> 42:25.959
Sing.
