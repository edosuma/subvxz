WEBVTT

00:07.041 --> 00:09.166
Yes, that's right,
the Kaminsky Foundation.

00:09.250 --> 00:12.583
So, your community canteen
owned by migrant women.

00:12.666 --> 00:14.583
Is that an organic community canteen?

00:16.750 --> 00:17.833
Good morning!

00:20.166 --> 00:22.125
Wow. This is not a happy bunch.

00:22.208 --> 00:23.875
Love the hunter look.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.291
Sorry, I'll call you back.

00:38.916 --> 00:41.083
Isn't this nice, being all together?

00:43.291 --> 00:44.125
Stay.

00:45.250 --> 00:46.875
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:48.500 --> 00:49.916
THE LAME PLAN

00:50.000 --> 00:51.708
THE CRAZY PLAN

00:51.791 --> 00:54.125
THE BOOTY PLAN

00:54.208 --> 00:56.166
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

00:56.250 --> 00:58.250
Can we sign a peace treaty
for the weekend?

00:58.333 --> 01:01.125
Yes! Great idea, Julio!

01:01.208 --> 01:02.416
Let's take a table selfie.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.875
Just a photo. A souvenir.

01:03.958 --> 01:05.041
Everyone smile.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.041
Great! Beautiful.

01:08.125 --> 01:09.375
Wow. Beautiful.

01:10.458 --> 01:12.041
Antoine, say something.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.791
Well, thank you.

01:15.541 --> 01:18.541
Thank you to the storm
for forcing you to stay here.

01:20.625 --> 01:21.666
Coffee, my love?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.000
-Yes.
-Yes?

01:24.083 --> 01:26.875
Some tea, sweetie?
Since you gave up coffee six months ago.

01:26.958 --> 01:28.041
I'll have both.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.291
-Yeah.
-A little of both.

01:29.375 --> 01:30.416
This is much better.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.416
Because I have my two mugs. I'm good.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.416
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:34.041 --> 01:34.916
That's nice of you.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.708
-Thank you. I'm good.
-Yes.

01:38.333 --> 01:39.208
Toast, my love?

01:40.208 --> 01:41.708
You want me to butter you up?

01:41.791 --> 01:44.166
I mean, butter the toast
that I've already toasted?

01:45.375 --> 01:47.416
Eddy, don't play in the trash.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.541
Stop him instead of saying no.

01:49.625 --> 01:52.208
That's sweet.
It's super cute. He's recycling.

01:52.291 --> 01:54.958
-Yeah.
-No, it's anything but cute. It's gross.

01:55.041 --> 01:57.291
And dangerous. What if there are needles?

01:57.375 --> 01:59.041
And she wants a kid?

01:59.125 --> 02:01.041
-What?
-It's cute and gross.

02:01.125 --> 02:02.666
Just like life.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.541
The thunder wasn't all
we heard last night.

02:06.625 --> 02:07.791
Huh, lovebirds?

02:08.541 --> 02:10.583
Some of us know how to honor our wives.

02:10.666 --> 02:12.750
No, that is
a really embarrassing sentence.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.000
Well, I only heard the thunder.
That's crazy.

02:15.083 --> 02:16.333
Nothing from your side.

02:17.375 --> 02:20.458
No, because we practice RAC,
Rhythmic Athletic Copulation.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.791
It's quiet, but honestly,
it's amazing. Seriously.

02:23.875 --> 02:26.166
A regular fuck is what? How much, babe?

02:26.250 --> 02:27.541
-Sixty-nine.
-Sixty-nine calories.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.166
-Whereas we work off 200, easy.
-Easy.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.333
Easy.

02:31.416 --> 02:34.083
We keep each other warm
since you stole our comforter.

02:34.166 --> 02:36.291
-Yeah.
-At least I only steal comforters.

02:36.375 --> 02:37.958
Okay, I'm not hungry anymore.

02:38.041 --> 02:40.916
This has killed my appetite.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.875
Yeah, you need to be careful.
When you easily gain weight…

02:45.291 --> 02:47.208
Milou? Your shampoo is awesome.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.583
-Thanks.
-Too bad it makes some hair go frizzy.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.083
I think we all need a group activity.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.125
Are you in?

02:54.208 --> 02:55.041
-No way.
-We can't.

02:55.125 --> 02:58.000
Because we have a thing.
Then we're going back to Paris.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.458
-Yes, beat it.
-No, come on.

02:59.541 --> 03:01.083
-You first.
-After you.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.708
-I insist.
-It's fine.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.750
-Get out.
-This is ridiculous. Stop, it's fine…

03:05.833 --> 03:07.750
No one is leaving, okay?

03:07.833 --> 03:09.791
We're going to do a group thing right now!

03:14.500 --> 03:15.708
Isn't this great?

03:17.333 --> 03:19.458
Okay, I'll pick the teams. So…

03:20.375 --> 03:21.833
Shit! I have a genius idea.

03:22.458 --> 03:23.458
Girls against boys!

03:24.125 --> 03:25.541
-How about it?
-No.

03:25.625 --> 03:27.625
We've already got the costumes,
the colors.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.083
It's really dumb. We'll lose.
You hate losing.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.791
-Nonsense.
-And Elsa sucks.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.375
-Stop it.
-Go, let's do this!

03:33.458 --> 03:35.000
-Let's go!
-Yeah, go!

03:35.083 --> 03:37.333
The love of my life,
with his tight little ass.

03:37.416 --> 03:39.125
-I'll kill him.
-What?

03:39.666 --> 03:41.333
-You kill him. I'll kill you.
-Go!

03:41.416 --> 03:42.750
The boys are gonna lose!

03:42.833 --> 03:44.958
I'm going to kill her.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.666
-Wait.
-Elsa, that's not how the game works.

03:47.750 --> 03:48.750
Easy, wait!

03:49.250 --> 03:51.833
-What a great idea.
-Move it, or I'll bust your ass.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.333
It's the babysitter.

03:53.416 --> 03:56.000
Hello? Is Eddy okay?
Did he eat? Did he take his nap?

03:57.833 --> 03:59.541
I'm on the phone with Yolande!

03:59.625 --> 04:01.125
-That was a test shot!
-Shit!

04:01.208 --> 04:03.083
After this, I'm killing your ass. Go!

04:03.166 --> 04:05.500
Girls against guys!
We're going to destroy you!

04:07.625 --> 04:08.666
Wait for me!

04:11.916 --> 04:14.416
Come on, Max. Come on, champ.
It's going to be okay.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.708
Not in the balls!

04:19.791 --> 04:21.708
No! It's girls against guys!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
What are you doing?

04:32.708 --> 04:34.291
-I'm getting out of here!
-But…

04:36.416 --> 04:37.958
Shit, get down!

04:40.375 --> 04:41.791
It's the real estate agency.

04:43.166 --> 04:44.000
Yes?

04:45.375 --> 04:47.000
Of course we still want to sell.

04:48.666 --> 04:50.166
Tomorrow at the house at ten?

04:50.250 --> 04:51.625
I'm not going back in there.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.458
Matt unloaded his gun on my ass.
Those little pellets hurt.

04:54.541 --> 04:56.625
You think Matt's actually sad?

04:56.708 --> 04:59.708
And the others? Antoine hasn't said
a word to me all morning.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.500
We'll do your awesome idea,
then head back to Paris.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.541
-It is a genius idea, isn't it?
-Selling Parisian shit to farmers?

05:06.625 --> 05:09.208
-The compost.
-Same thing. Let's get out of here.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.041
No! We need to stay!

05:11.125 --> 05:14.333
I've been thinking about it.
We need to get back into the gang.

05:14.416 --> 05:18.083
They need to love us again. It's our gang.
We've always been a part of it.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.833
We need to prove it to them.

05:19.916 --> 05:22.041
That our love is made of steel.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.458
And a mayor with no friends
isn't a good image.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.125
-You think?
-We need to split up.

05:27.916 --> 05:28.833
You're dumping me?

05:28.916 --> 05:30.583
No! In the game!

05:30.666 --> 05:33.291
-You against me!
-Oh, okay.

05:33.375 --> 05:37.333
I'll handle Elsa. You get Matt back.
To each their goal. We've got two goals.

05:37.416 --> 05:40.041
De Gaulle? My father loves him.
What's he got to do with us?

05:41.583 --> 05:43.500
Okay. What would De Gaulle do?

05:44.666 --> 05:47.333
He would go back.
He would go back and fight.

05:48.958 --> 05:50.791
-You're right.
-Yes.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.541
Go on, honey.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.750
De Gaulle. No. Relax, everything's fine.

05:54.833 --> 05:57.833
Come on.
It's you and me against the world!

06:07.250 --> 06:08.708
Hey, lovebirds.

06:08.791 --> 06:11.000
What are you doing here? We're busy.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.583
I don't know. I wanted
to spend some time with you.

06:13.666 --> 06:14.750
Well, we don't.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.666
-Quit it!
-All right.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.875
See you later, turtledoves.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.291
Well, she's crazy!

06:21.375 --> 06:24.000
Wait. Maybe she's right.
We don't have to do it here.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.708
We need to call Briska.

06:25.791 --> 06:27.625
-Who?
-The procreation shaman.

06:30.083 --> 06:30.958
Kiss me.

06:33.791 --> 06:34.833
<i>Hi, </i>amore!

06:35.458 --> 06:37.125
Briska! Namaste!

06:37.208 --> 06:40.291
We're ready for
the "Moon in Capricorn" ceremony.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.291
And we need you to start the drumming.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.000
-No. Please, not the drums.
-Yes.

06:44.083 --> 06:47.291
<i>Sorry, but there's something blocking.</i>

06:47.375 --> 06:49.625
-What?
<i>-Someone is blocking.</i>

06:50.125 --> 06:51.375
<i>A broken pact.</i>

06:51.458 --> 06:54.208
<i>Betraying one's word within a friendship.</i>

06:55.666 --> 06:56.958
<i>Do you know what I mean?</i>

06:57.625 --> 06:58.583
-No.
-Yes.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.875
No, I can't think of anything.
I don't know.

07:00.958 --> 07:03.583
<i>The eagles are prowling, you see?</i>
<i>You need to communicate.</i>

07:03.666 --> 07:05.916
<i>You need to unblock everything.</i>

07:06.000 --> 07:09.416
You mean if I unblock the blocking,

07:09.500 --> 07:12.875
then it would unblock everything,
and I'll get pregnant, is that it?

07:12.958 --> 07:14.208
Fuck, I'm out of ammo!

07:14.291 --> 07:15.125
Briska?

07:17.583 --> 07:18.750
Okay. Namaste.

07:31.708 --> 07:32.625
Charlotte?

07:33.791 --> 07:36.416
-Are you speaking to me again?
-Why did you come here?

07:36.500 --> 07:39.083
We just came to enjoy the countryside

07:39.166 --> 07:40.791
as a couple, with family.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.083
Okay, great.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.541
And we love each other.

07:55.458 --> 07:56.375
Matt!

07:57.958 --> 07:59.916
-No.
-What?

08:00.541 --> 08:02.208
Charlotte.

08:04.041 --> 08:05.583
The fox is in the furnace.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.458
Repeat. The fox is in the furnace.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.333
Them being a couple
still really bugs you, huh?

08:11.416 --> 08:13.750
Look who's talking.
Have you seen yourself?

08:13.833 --> 08:15.375
It's totally different for me.

08:15.916 --> 08:18.541
I'm struggling
because Charlotte has a new guy.

08:18.625 --> 08:21.375
She broke a pact we made when we were 15.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.708
We promised we wouldn't steal
each other's exes.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.458
You know what?

08:26.541 --> 08:28.000
I've actually been thinking.

08:28.083 --> 08:31.583
Seeing you two this morning,
I thought you guys were good together.

08:31.666 --> 08:33.291
-You believe in us now?
-Yeah.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.666
And honestly,
having Max as a brother-in-law…

08:36.416 --> 08:37.833
Hey, it'd be hard to top that.

08:37.916 --> 08:41.083
My brother. Best <i>del mundo,</i>
I'm glad we're on the same page again.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.625
12:12, the hyena is emerging from the box.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.666
-Yes.
-What are you doing? What?

08:48.375 --> 08:49.833
Attack technique.

08:49.916 --> 08:51.125
Sun Tzu, <i>The Art of War.</i>

08:51.208 --> 08:53.625
-Now!
-You and Max, never!

08:55.333 --> 08:58.708
Elsa! What the hell are you doing?
Charlotte is on our team!

08:58.791 --> 08:59.916
Okay, I'll stop!

09:02.666 --> 09:05.375
Finally, Max! Someone who understands!

09:05.458 --> 09:07.916
It's girls against guys.
It's not rocket science!

09:08.000 --> 09:09.791
I love you, Charlotte!

09:17.791 --> 09:19.875
Did you take a blood oath and everything?

09:19.958 --> 09:22.041
With a drop of blood
and a memory box, why?

09:22.125 --> 09:24.041
You're blocked over a teenage pact?

09:24.125 --> 09:25.958
Enough with the blocking thing.

09:26.041 --> 09:28.333
What is with all of you? I'm not blocking.

09:28.416 --> 09:30.875
There's no blocking.
You're fucking blocking.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.583
-You're blocking.
-No.

09:33.666 --> 09:34.833
-You're blocking.
-No.

09:34.916 --> 09:35.791
-Yes.
-No.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.166
You want to talk about selling
the house now?

09:38.250 --> 09:40.500
What's the issue?
Granny gave us the green light.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.083
Don't we like living there?

09:42.166 --> 09:45.333
Yeah, with psychopath farmers
and a boiler that's about to explode?

09:45.416 --> 09:48.125
-It's our first visit in three months.
-Maybe it's a sign.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.208
Don't be an Elsa. If you don't want
to sell, go back to work.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.541
Come on, Matt! Let's call a truce!

09:55.625 --> 09:57.208
I can go talk to Chacha right now.

09:57.291 --> 09:58.958
-Oh yeah?
-Anytime I want.

09:59.750 --> 10:00.583
Go ahead, then.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.166
Matt, 20 years of friendship.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.166
-Fine, I'm going.
-So go now.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.625
You're my blood.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.208
The blood in my veins, bro!

10:07.291 --> 10:08.958
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

10:09.041 --> 10:11.041
Don't say anything
about selling the house.

10:11.125 --> 10:12.625
-Why?
-Just because.

10:12.708 --> 10:15.166
I've convinced everyone
I love living out here.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.750
Who does that?

10:16.833 --> 10:17.708
Everyone.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.375
-No, they don't.
-Yes, they do.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.583
All right, that's enough.
Come on, my love.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.500
Everything will work out.
We'll sell the house.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.583
We'll go back to Paris.
You'll get over your depression.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.500
-Look at me.
-Okay.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.250
-I love you.
-I love you too.

10:32.291 --> 10:33.708
-Fuck! My gun!
-Got you!

10:33.791 --> 10:35.625
Milou! Now what am I supposed to do?

10:41.166 --> 10:43.750
It's me! Don't shoot, fuck!

10:46.916 --> 10:48.500
Truce?

10:49.416 --> 10:50.916
-Truce.
-Great.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.666
Okay, help me.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.125
-I am.
-Help me.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.291
-Okay.
-Okay.

11:01.666 --> 11:03.000
I'm putting it down.

11:05.625 --> 11:06.958
I wanted to tell you that…

11:07.041 --> 11:08.125
Yeah?

11:12.208 --> 11:13.916
Oh shit! Me too!

11:14.000 --> 11:16.791
-I'm not having a mental block. All right?
-Yes.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.375
-So let's unblock.
-Of course.

11:18.458 --> 11:21.875
I wanted to say that you don't put on
weight in your ass or anywhere.

11:21.958 --> 11:24.833
And your hair doesn't get frizzy.
Not all the time.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.625
So you're not mad
about Max and me anymore?

11:28.708 --> 11:29.541
No.

11:29.625 --> 11:31.208
Oh shit. I'm so happy.

11:31.791 --> 11:35.583
You know, I came here just for that.
I wanted to spend some time with you.

11:35.666 --> 11:37.750
Move, damn it.

11:37.833 --> 11:40.750
-Come on. Let's get them.
-But they're going to shoot me.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.458
No, see, the thing with Max,
I don't even really care.

11:43.958 --> 11:47.416
It's funny that you got my sloppy seconds.
You're recycling, for once.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.291
My favorite little trash bag!

11:51.416 --> 11:53.875
What are you doing?
I'm all alone against the boys!

11:53.958 --> 11:55.833
We'll do a 4-4-3-2 attack, okay?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.625
Are you guys hugging?

11:57.708 --> 11:58.666
-Yes.
-Yeah.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.375
-That's awesome!
-Yeah!

12:00.458 --> 12:02.625
See how happy the countryside
makes people?

12:04.333 --> 12:06.083
Milou's butt! Go ahead, have at it!

12:06.166 --> 12:07.416
Attack!

12:14.125 --> 12:15.791
Shoot, guys! Shoot!

12:23.583 --> 12:24.791
My balls!

12:26.625 --> 12:28.750
-Truce!
-We surrender!

12:28.833 --> 12:30.375
Truce!

12:31.916 --> 12:34.250
-We won!
-Yes!

12:34.333 --> 12:36.208
We won!

12:36.291 --> 12:39.166
-We won!
-Thanks to whom?

12:39.250 --> 12:40.333
Beat it, you.

12:40.416 --> 12:42.541
Where are you going? Where are they going?

12:42.625 --> 12:44.125
-We won!
-Where are they going?

12:44.208 --> 12:45.666
Wait up! We won!

12:45.750 --> 12:46.583
Wait!

13:01.416 --> 13:03.041
Shut up!

13:10.333 --> 13:12.958
-You want me to butter it?
-You want another coffee?

13:13.041 --> 13:14.291
Oh yeah!

13:15.750 --> 13:16.875
Sorori-heart,

13:16.958 --> 13:19.250
sorori-me, sorori-you,

13:19.333 --> 13:21.375
sorori-cheesy!

13:21.458 --> 13:23.166
So you combined the two, is that it?

13:23.666 --> 13:24.708
So what is it?

13:24.791 --> 13:26.208
We just came up with it.

13:26.291 --> 13:27.958
-We're so close.
-My sister.

13:28.583 --> 13:29.416
Cheesy.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.958
RECOGNIZING BURN OUT

13:33.000 --> 13:34.333
I have something for you.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.666
It's bigger than mine.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.416
-What is it?
-A peace offering.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.708
It's a Parapoutna-ak seed.

13:42.791 --> 13:44.750
It does look like dried poop, doesn't it?

13:44.833 --> 13:47.333
I've always dreamed of having
a Parapoutna-ak seed.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.208
A peace offering.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.583
My most prized possession.

13:58.666 --> 14:01.041
And it's second-hand. It used to be mine.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.375
So she gets the mommy model, not the baby.

14:03.958 --> 14:06.875
Wow, it's gorgeous. Namaste.

14:06.958 --> 14:08.458
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

14:08.541 --> 14:10.500
I need to empty it out first.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.333
I don't think you'll get it back.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.250
Stop.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.000
In any case, you guys are so cute.
I'm so happy.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.375
My love.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.333
Go ahead.

14:26.291 --> 14:28.083
-Is this Britney?
-Rihanna.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.250
-Not bad, huh?
-Yeah.

14:31.875 --> 14:32.708
Yeah.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.875
HOUSE VISIT 10:00 AM

14:36.958 --> 14:37.916
Shit, already?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.791
All right, everyone out!

14:39.875 --> 14:42.875
Go for a walk.
Fill your lungs with nature.

14:42.958 --> 14:44.791
You're not coming to the ceremony?

14:44.875 --> 14:47.458
I can't. I need to tidy up,
and Eddy will be up soon.

14:47.541 --> 14:50.208
-I can do it with you, Elsa.
-Or we can all do it later?

14:50.291 --> 14:53.166
Wait, Cha, you can't. We have to…

14:54.000 --> 14:56.291
We're going on that walk
to see farms in the area.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.791
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
I'm doing the FMC.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.125
-What?
-The Facile Moon Ceremony.

15:02.208 --> 15:04.041
-Jeez, does no one listen?
-Fertile.

15:04.125 --> 15:07.541
-Fertile.
-Okay, fertile, go for it. Go on, out!

15:07.625 --> 15:10.625
-Meet up later?
-I don't care where you go. Just go.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.791
Go for a walk.
And you, get dressed, please.

15:14.625 --> 15:15.708
I am dressed.

15:15.791 --> 15:16.916
You are?

15:33.083 --> 15:34.166
-Is that them?
-No.

15:35.125 --> 15:36.208
It's my mother.

15:36.291 --> 15:38.791
Well, that's strange.
They're 12 minutes late.

15:39.333 --> 15:42.875
Did you put the right train station
in the email? Butts Wood station?

15:42.958 --> 15:45.208
Yes. B-U-T-T-S.

15:45.291 --> 15:48.708
-Yes.
-I keep calling. They're not picking up.

15:48.791 --> 15:50.833
Weird. It's them! Go!

15:50.916 --> 15:52.000
No, it's not them.

15:53.416 --> 15:54.916
-Hey!
-What are you doing here?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.125
Emilie invited me.

15:56.208 --> 15:58.291
-I could only come on Sunday--
-Just a second.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.333
Regarding the…

15:59.416 --> 16:01.291
That was when no one could make it.

16:01.375 --> 16:03.708
He stays outside.
We can't let him ruin the sale.

16:04.583 --> 16:05.708
-You came?
-Yes.

16:05.791 --> 16:08.500
Go over there.
The donkey's waiting for you.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.291
How cute. He's calling you. Later.

16:11.041 --> 16:11.958
Milou, come on.

16:12.041 --> 16:14.500
He's not leaving. Take him to the bar.

16:14.583 --> 16:15.541
-What?
-There.

16:15.625 --> 16:16.958
He's not moving.

16:17.708 --> 16:18.625
What's up?

16:18.708 --> 16:20.541
-Are we gonna see the donkey?
-No. Julio.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.750
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.416
First of all, what a beautiful estate.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.958
Sorry, I didn't introduce myself.

16:29.041 --> 16:32.166
Maxime Pauillac, mayoral candidate
for the 9th district in Paris.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.166
I have a project
that will revolutionize farming.

16:35.250 --> 16:39.958
I'm offering to send you the shit…
the compost of my constituents

16:40.916 --> 16:43.375
so that you can grow…

16:43.458 --> 16:44.916
Let me stop you right there.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.125
I have horses.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.333
I don't grow anything.

16:50.041 --> 16:50.958
Yes.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.750
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.666
He might not be the right target.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.250
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.208
Shit, she's calling again.

17:03.291 --> 17:05.708
It's the woman for the visit.
I don't want her here.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.875
Just give it to him. He'll handle it.

17:08.916 --> 17:09.750
You sure?

17:11.416 --> 17:12.291
Yes, madam.

17:12.375 --> 17:15.541
-I like it here. I don't want to sell--
-Don't worry. He's handling it.

17:15.625 --> 17:16.458
Oh yeah?

17:16.541 --> 17:18.375
The things women make us do.

17:18.458 --> 17:20.500
Don't complain.
You have real estate issues.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.666
I've been wearing rabbit poop around
my neck for the last six months.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.416
I have sex listening to shaman drums
and climax on a schedule.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.500
-Yeah, I gotta admit.
-Yeah.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.458
But please tell me you want this kid?

17:33.541 --> 17:35.291
Yeah, of course.

17:35.375 --> 17:36.500
Especially with her.

17:36.583 --> 17:38.041
That's the most important.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.375
See, I truly love Eddy,

17:39.458 --> 17:41.875
but I'd rather chop off my arm
than have another kid.

17:41.958 --> 17:43.166
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

17:47.541 --> 17:49.291
See, Elsa and I are really struggling.

17:50.208 --> 17:54.083
I feel like it's a sign
that I'm not entirely ready.

17:54.958 --> 17:57.041
Ready for what? To be a father?

17:57.125 --> 17:58.333
You'll never be ready.

17:58.916 --> 18:00.291
Especially with your first.

18:00.791 --> 18:02.083
That's reassuring.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.041
That lady won't be coming back.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.166
I may have taken it too far.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.708
I said there was a children's cemetery
under the garden.

18:09.208 --> 18:10.541
We're still on topic.

18:10.625 --> 18:13.708
Thanks, man. I can't lie.
Whenever I lie, I get caught.

18:14.416 --> 18:15.625
Actors Studio.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.916
Cha, please pick up.

19:08.875 --> 19:09.958
Yes?

19:10.791 --> 19:11.708
Hello, sir.

19:12.958 --> 19:14.000
First of all,

19:14.500 --> 19:16.000
what a magnificent estate.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.166
Sorry, I haven't introduced myself.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.500
My name is Maxime Pauillac.
I'm running for mayor--

19:23.333 --> 19:24.916
This is going to be a pain.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.416
<i>Antoine, have you heard from the buyers?</i>

19:32.500 --> 19:35.500
Well, call them back,
or give me their number. I don't know!

19:36.000 --> 19:36.833
But…

19:37.708 --> 19:38.541
All right.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.208
Like that!

19:42.791 --> 19:43.625
Yes, Elsa!

19:43.708 --> 19:45.125
Nature up my pussy.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.875
Oh yeah!

19:48.333 --> 19:49.166
Wait.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.833
Oh, my love. He's so sweet.
He's calling me again.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.000
-Aren't you going to answer?
-No.

19:57.083 --> 19:59.250
-The facial moon gets priority.
-No.

19:59.333 --> 20:02.083
Stop. Sorry, but it's not "facial."

20:02.166 --> 20:03.083
It's "fertile."

20:03.166 --> 20:05.333
-Fertile, right.
-It's not the same.

20:05.416 --> 20:06.916
Yeah. That's what I meant.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.875
Him again.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.708
I'll be right back, okay?

20:14.333 --> 20:17.333
If I unblock, I'll get unstuck.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.541
Ovulation.

20:18.625 --> 20:19.541
Fertility.

20:19.625 --> 20:23.166
It's great that you're interested
because this project has potential

20:23.250 --> 20:27.250
and will hugely benefit the countryside
and finally connect Paris

20:27.333 --> 20:28.416
and the countryside.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.625
Paris will send you

20:31.583 --> 20:34.916
poop and peelings-- Well, compost.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.416
And that will enable you,

20:37.500 --> 20:39.625
the lung of our beloved France,

20:39.708 --> 20:41.666
this French countryside
built in our image--

20:41.750 --> 20:42.625
Hello!

20:42.708 --> 20:45.333
I'm Charlotte Ben Smires,
his campaign co-director.

20:45.416 --> 20:47.375
-Jehovah's Witnesses?
-Not at all!

20:47.458 --> 20:48.375
Go away.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.708
I finally reeled in a sucker,
and you barged in.

20:54.791 --> 20:55.958
You called me 1,000 times.

20:56.041 --> 20:59.666
-Yeah, but you showed up in a djellaba.
-It's not. It's got a belt. It's stylish.

20:59.750 --> 21:00.791
Sorry.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.250
I have a ceremony waiting. I'm off!

21:03.958 --> 21:06.166
-So I should finish on my own?
-Yeah!

21:07.250 --> 21:09.291
I don't understand
why they didn't show up.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.125
Maybe they changed their minds.

21:11.208 --> 21:12.750
You don't give a damn.

21:12.833 --> 21:15.708
-I don't know.
-You don't even seem disappointed.

21:20.166 --> 21:25.791
I'm going to go now because I have a call

21:26.708 --> 21:27.541
with Eddy.

21:28.375 --> 21:31.083
Hey! You want to try
my double-flavored quiche?

21:31.166 --> 21:33.791
-I wanted to celebrate us coming together.
-Yeah.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.250
Look. It's beautiful.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.916
-Well?
-Yeah.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.875
-Go on, try it.
-Yeah. It's gorgeous.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.000
There we go.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.333
-Well…
-Help yourself.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.958
Is it really that gross?

21:56.041 --> 21:57.083
No.

22:00.708 --> 22:01.875
I want to throw up.

22:01.958 --> 22:02.791
Oh, shit.

22:02.875 --> 22:04.666
No, not "shit." It's awesome.

22:04.750 --> 22:05.916
-It is?
-Yes.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.291
In movies, what does it mean
when women feel like throwing up?

22:09.375 --> 22:10.666
That they're sick.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.375
No, it means they're pregnant.

22:13.583 --> 22:14.791
Yeah, so?

22:14.875 --> 22:16.541
I might be pregnant!

22:17.500 --> 22:18.500
Is that a good thing?

22:18.583 --> 22:19.458
-Yes.
-Yes.

22:19.541 --> 22:21.458
Of course.

22:22.625 --> 22:24.916
-I'm kidding, of course.
-You don't like kids?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.791
Me? Yes. A lot.

22:26.875 --> 22:29.166
Yes. In fact…

22:30.208 --> 22:31.208
I want some.

22:31.291 --> 22:34.208
-You always said you didn't want any.
-Max would make a good dad.

22:34.291 --> 22:35.625
-Seriously.
-No.

22:35.708 --> 22:37.708
He would! In fact, I'm feeling nauseous.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.500
Hey, maybe I'm a little pregnant.

22:43.583 --> 22:45.583
What if we get pregnant at the same time?

22:45.666 --> 22:48.708
It would be such a twist.
We'd be like sisters!

22:48.791 --> 22:51.041
No, it would be weird.
We're not white trash.

22:51.125 --> 22:53.458
Milou, don't you want another go?

22:53.541 --> 22:56.625
What, another pregnancy?
I'd rather chop my arm off.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.083
Do you have any symptoms?

22:58.708 --> 22:59.541
Yeah.

22:59.625 --> 23:02.000
For starters,
I don't want to eat this quiche.

23:02.083 --> 23:03.583
That doesn't mean anything.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.041
Are your nipples swollen?

23:06.750 --> 23:07.708
Because mine are.

23:07.791 --> 23:09.416
Oh yeah? Me too, yes.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.291
-Shit. Look, they're huge.
-Is your sense of smell heightened?

23:13.958 --> 23:14.833
Yeah.

23:14.916 --> 23:16.625
-Something here stinks.
-I farted.

23:17.833 --> 23:20.666
-Do you feel like farting?
-No, I have to admit, no.

23:20.750 --> 23:22.625
-There. You're not pregnant.
-I'm not?

23:23.208 --> 23:25.166
But you don't want children anyway.

23:25.250 --> 23:28.125
Now that you mention it,
I may have a slight urge to fart.

23:29.416 --> 23:31.458
-It's not ready to come out yet.
-I'm going.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.625
Wait, it's getting closer! Wait!

24:03.000 --> 24:04.166
Elsa, can I talk to you?

24:04.250 --> 24:07.666
No, I'm in the middle of the ceremony
for my pregnancy test.

24:08.500 --> 24:11.000
It's so I can surprise Julio, in case…

24:11.500 --> 24:12.500
Okay.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.708
But isn't it kind of early for the test?

24:14.791 --> 24:16.666
No, I have a good feeling.

24:24.625 --> 24:28.041
Sorry about the farmers' visits.
But I've won over Elsa, at least. I think.

24:28.125 --> 24:29.541
Yeah, that's cool.

24:29.625 --> 24:31.083
I may have gone overboard.

24:31.166 --> 24:33.625
I told her that I might be knocked up.
What a nightmare.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.041
Let's take a test anyway.

24:35.833 --> 24:38.291
Your pill is powerless
against my champion sperm.

24:39.875 --> 24:41.875
The local farmers
didn't think you were a champion.

24:42.458 --> 24:44.916
You didn't see those guys.
They're so close-minded.

24:45.416 --> 24:46.416
They're like oysters.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.375
Yeah, but it's not exactly fun
living here. It's like a crime show.

24:49.458 --> 24:51.416
These guys must lose their minds.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.291
And they say we Parisians are grumpy.

24:53.375 --> 24:54.541
"He knocks on the door."

24:55.416 --> 24:56.541
"Little pigs."

24:57.208 --> 24:59.750
-"Sweet little pigs."
-That's a cool costume.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.125
-"Can I come in?"
-Why is he dressed like a farmer?

25:02.208 --> 25:04.750
"Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"

25:04.833 --> 25:07.083
"So I will huff and puff
and blow your house away!"

25:07.166 --> 25:09.916
No, seriously,
how did we not think of it before?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.875
Shit. You're right.

25:12.916 --> 25:14.583
I just had a genius idea.

25:14.666 --> 25:18.125
No, I had the brilliant idea
but didn't state it, so it's mine.

25:21.666 --> 25:24.333
Are you kidding? I'm the one who--
I'm looking at him.

25:24.416 --> 25:25.500
Charlotte, can we talk?

25:27.708 --> 25:28.875
One sec. We're having sex.

25:32.875 --> 25:33.750
Okay.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.375
Where are you going?

25:45.750 --> 25:46.625
What's that?

25:47.875 --> 25:49.333
Who gave you that? Elsa?

25:50.583 --> 25:51.750
It's the garbage!

25:51.833 --> 25:54.000
Glasses? The one with glasses?

25:56.500 --> 25:57.333
Thanks!

25:59.916 --> 26:00.750
So great.
