01:13.206 --> 01:15.190
So, first party
the new place, huh, Drama?

01:15.342 --> 01:17.934
Don't be ignorant, E.
It's not a party, it's a get-together.

01:18.261 --> 01:19.945
And the difference is what?

01:20.060 --> 01:22.324
Get-together is less than
a dozen people, bro.

01:22.408 --> 01:25.109
Don't be ignorant, 'cause
this is definitely gonna be a party.

01:25.176 --> 01:28.037
Or simultaneous get-togethers if
it makes it easier for you to swallow.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.383
What are you guys talking about?

01:29.470 --> 01:31.682
We're welcoming home Vinnie Chase!
People want to come.

01:31.732 --> 01:34.126
I thought we agreed to keep it small...
a family affair.

01:34.498 --> 01:35.592
I never signed anything.

01:35.659 --> 01:37.226
If you want to do it at the hotel...?

01:37.310 --> 01:39.434
No no, bro,
this is your welcome-home party.

01:39.518 --> 01:40.705
We can't do it at a hotel.

01:41.053 --> 01:42.449
Now that I have a beautiful home,

01:42.533 --> 01:44.787
I'd be honored to welcome you
and your party.

01:45.019 --> 01:46.601
I just need to know how many people.

01:47.510 --> 01:49.361
I'd have to check the evite rsvp list

01:49.445 --> 01:51.465
Before I could accurately
respond to that.

01:51.822 --> 01:54.673
- <I>Calm down, baby!</I>
- Do not tell me to calm down!

01:54.748 --> 01:56.482
They're giving my son a hard time!

01:56.583 --> 01:59.105
<I>My baby boy. A mother gets protective
when that happens.</I>

01:59.156 --> 02:01.490
What did they say?
Did they say that he's not getting in?

02:01.523 --> 02:03.137
They wouldn't say anything on the phone,

02:03.204 --> 02:05.392
Just that they'd like to see us.
They're like the CIA.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.142
Then relax.
He's getting in.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.061
- Well, he better, Ari.
- <I>He's a legacy!</I>

02:09.241 --> 02:12.108
Legacies are as sure a thing
as me having to beg for blowjobs.

02:12.277 --> 02:15.601
Little Jonah will be a proud member
of the Briar country day school

02:15.702 --> 02:16.948
Just like his sister,

02:17.099 --> 02:19.187
- <I>fear not.</I>
- Begging won't be enough if he isn't.

02:19.572 --> 02:21.591
I got to go, baby.
I'll see you at the school.

02:22.681 --> 02:24.909
Welcome Vinnie Chase home tonight.
Here's the address.

02:28.717 --> 02:30.165
Sorry, limited space.

02:30.786 --> 02:32.032
What? I didn't invite the dude.

02:32.116 --> 02:33.849
- Lloyd, you miss us?
- I did, I did.

02:33.968 --> 02:36.055
- Welcome back, boys.
- Lloyd, how are you?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.436
- Great.
- What up, Lloyd?

02:37.557 --> 02:38.583
Nothing, not much.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.627
So I spent all evening
preparing a little something

02:41.695 --> 02:43.628
for the big bash...
creme brulee.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.590
It's not a bash, Lloyd.
It's a large get-together.

02:46.918 --> 02:48.197
Whatever it is, Drama,

02:48.786 --> 02:50.402
Is it okay if I bring four friends?

02:51.160 --> 02:52.271
What sort of friends?

02:52.534 --> 02:55.260
It's fine, Lloyd. Just no public
displays of affection, all right?

02:55.311 --> 02:56.388
Is that Vinnie Chase?

02:56.725 --> 02:58.844
Oh my god!
Look at that!

02:58.979 --> 03:01.099
I don't believe...
usually I have to get "us weekly"

03:01.150 --> 03:02.530
to get a look at those pretty eyes.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.217
And I have to look at the wee
bottom, lower corner of the frame

03:05.318 --> 03:07.118
to see the top
of this little man's head.

03:07.806 --> 03:09.439
You look a little pudgy, Ari.

03:09.506 --> 03:12.505
- You put on a little weight?
- You wish! Six percent body fat.

03:12.555 --> 03:14.844
Achieve that when you're 40,
and I'll give you 100 grand.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.478
- When'd you get in?
- Late last night.

03:16.545 --> 03:19.661
- You coming to the welcome-home party?
- We understand if you can't make it.

03:19.711 --> 03:21.445
I will be there. First things first.

03:22.033 --> 03:24.154
- Do I look heavy?
- No, you look good.

03:24.252 --> 03:26.137
- Yeah, baby!
- What?

03:26.370 --> 03:28.558
Oh, this broad I met on myspace,
she's coming...

03:28.960 --> 03:30.272
with her sorority.

03:32.488 --> 03:35.714
- So, Italy was good?
- It was amazing.

03:35.815 --> 03:38.086
Leave it to E to pick
the most romantic spot on earth

03:38.151 --> 03:40.303
- right after he gets dumped.
- We're taking a break.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.053
Whatever. So, you planning
another vacation or you gonna step up?

03:43.107 --> 03:44.761
Vince is planning
on going back to work.

03:44.949 --> 03:46.109
As an actor,

03:46.226 --> 03:48.456
or as a producer
of another jungle quagmire?

03:48.506 --> 03:50.501
The movie that's gonna
take us to the next level,

03:50.528 --> 03:51.958
you're writing it off as a disaster?

03:52.065 --> 03:55.432
I am writing it off as MIA
and proceeding accordingly.

03:56.102 --> 03:57.341
He always was so nervous.

03:57.395 --> 03:59.838
I know... is that how you keep
the pounds off? By trembling?

03:59.940 --> 04:02.508
What do you expect? <i>Medellin</i>
has been delayed month after month.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.945
You've got a director who refuses
to show a single frame to anybody.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.191
- We're seeing it today.
- Bullshit.

04:08.272 --> 04:10.245
Every frame of it.
Why do you think we came back?

04:10.289 --> 04:11.988
- And we're out of money.
- There's that.

04:12.069 --> 04:13.444
- Are you?
- You know they charge

04:13.498 --> 04:15.089
up to $30 for a bowl of penne?

04:15.116 --> 04:16.755
Vince wants a job.
Tell us what you got.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.190
- I gotta see the movie.
- Not gonna happen.

04:19.353 --> 04:20.988
Walsh won't even let Rubinstein see it.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.685
He understands that at some point
everyone's gonna see it, right?

04:23.766 --> 04:25.864
At some point, everyone will.
We're seeing it today

04:25.932 --> 04:27.384
And we're telling you he needs a job.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.065
I'm telling you that
I need to see it.

04:29.119 --> 04:30.974
What does one thing
have to do with the other?

04:31.055 --> 04:33.138
- connect the fucking dots.
- No one's gonna hire me

04:33.206 --> 04:35.406
- until they've seen <i>Medellin</i> ?
- I wouldn't say no one.

04:35.460 --> 04:38.561
You can play jughead
in a new archies live-action.

04:39.607 --> 04:40.946
I think I'm more of a Reggie.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.944
Right now, no one is gonna
offer you something you want

04:44.025 --> 04:46.452
Or give you the kind
of money that we want.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.033
You can understand that, right?

04:48.087 --> 04:50.122
- Actually, I can't.
- The word on the street

04:50.223 --> 04:52.915
since day one of production
on <i>Medellin</i>

04:53.023 --> 04:54.226
has not been good.

04:54.514 --> 04:56.562
Dps and actors fired,
production delays,

04:56.663 --> 04:57.796
unstable director.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.132
No one wants to put
Vince's face on a poster

05:00.233 --> 05:03.669
with the possibility of a looming
disaster hanging out there.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.196
It's the "gigli" effect.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.139
Okay, so what do we need?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.049
We need for <i>medellin</i> to be good.

05:12.362 --> 05:14.780
Just tell me there's not going
to be more than 75 people.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.849
There's not gonna be
more than 75 people.

05:17.021 --> 05:18.684
- Really?
- No, not really.

05:18.785 --> 05:20.824
- That's what you told me to tell you.
- Dick.

05:21.292 --> 05:22.722
Why do you need baby wipes?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.219
Just get what's on the list.

05:24.619 --> 05:27.451
- 50 cartons?
- Please, don't question me, all right?

05:27.556 --> 05:28.827
All right, fine fine.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.664
It says "12 barbecued chicken wings."
You mean 1200?

05:31.765 --> 05:33.866
No, I meant what I wrote... 12.
They're for Vince.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.555
He loves the wings at Costco,

05:35.609 --> 05:38.671
But I'm not letting everyone else
go wild with barbecued chicken wings.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.506
So what's everyone else
gonna eat, then?

05:40.607 --> 05:42.141
Celery.
Read the list.

05:42.452 --> 05:44.216
- Celery?
- Yeah, and carrots.

05:44.324 --> 05:46.043
Look, the party's called for 9:00 pm.

05:46.205 --> 05:48.897
That's not a dinner party.
So only Vince is gonna eat real food.

05:49.032 --> 05:52.389
Everyone else is gonna
have nice, clean, stain-free

05:52.712 --> 05:54.320
- celery and carrots.
- Great.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.569
Think you guys have
enough baby wipes?

05:56.869 --> 05:59.396
No no, it's not what it looks like...
they're for a party.

05:59.665 --> 06:00.869
You wanna come?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.830
You like that one, huh?

06:07.663 --> 06:09.817
- I could do a play.
- You could.

06:10.005 --> 06:11.893
A play's not gonna
buy us a new house, though.

06:12.109 --> 06:14.106
It'd have to be a very
successful play, I think.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.003
Cavalry's arrived.
People, man your posts.

06:17.164 --> 06:18.499
Prepare to do battle.

06:19.324 --> 06:20.861
He looks good.
How are you, Billy?

06:21.047 --> 06:23.048
Living and thriving, suit.
Living and thriving.

06:23.496 --> 06:25.050
- What's up?
- How you doing?

06:25.422 --> 06:27.121
Just this, nothing else up.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.735
Come on back. I'll show
you the facilities. Come on.

06:32.450 --> 06:33.907
Cutting the old-fashioned way, huh?

06:34.126 --> 06:36.528
Why fuck a woman with a vibrator
when you've got a dick,

06:36.607 --> 06:38.468
- Right, suit?
- I don't know what that means,

06:38.522 --> 06:40.274
but we're excited to see
what you've done.

06:40.328 --> 06:43.797
Hey, everybody! You've been
looking at this guy's beautiful face

06:43.905 --> 06:46.405
for the past three months.
Vinnie Chase.

06:47.837 --> 06:50.965
And this is his suit,
though he don't dress the part.

06:51.850 --> 06:53.479
Guys, my whole crew is latin...

06:53.546 --> 06:56.382
helped make this film as
absolutely authentic as it could be.

06:56.615 --> 07:00.252
My editor, Raul, and his
assistant-slash-little-brother, Tero.

07:00.473 --> 07:02.441
Both mexican.
Both totally legal.

07:02.807 --> 07:04.559
My post guy is Brazilian.

07:04.965 --> 07:06.744
The caterers are from Chile.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.695
Every Thursday we get
that endangered sea bass flown in.

07:10.048 --> 07:12.431
- What's she do?
- She gives blowjobs.

07:13.355 --> 07:14.364
seriously.

07:14.471 --> 07:17.465
She's a streetwalker
I brought back from colombia. Good eyes.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.830
So can we get this thing going or what?

07:20.509 --> 07:22.235
You want to eat first?
You want something?

07:22.262 --> 07:23.542
- I'm okay.
- We got empanadas.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.044
- I'm all good.
- Want an empanada?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.619
- We just ate.
- How about a tamale?

07:26.673 --> 07:29.008
- We're all good.
- What about one of those blowjobs?

07:30.006 --> 07:32.484
What, does Turtle check
your balls for lipstick?

07:32.552 --> 07:34.395
- Quit stalling.
- I'm not fucking stalling.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.280
We really want to see it, come on.

07:36.558 --> 07:38.445
And I want you to see it, vin. I do.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.526
Uh, it's just not ready.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.028
It's... it's not ready.
I need a little bit more time.

07:43.740 --> 07:45.789
- What are you talking about?
- How much more time?

07:47.153 --> 07:49.013
- 3 weeks, a month tops.
- You can't have it.

07:49.116 --> 07:50.141
- Who says?
- I say.

07:50.195 --> 07:52.661
- Who the fuck are you?
- The guy with the fucking checkbook.

07:52.743 --> 07:54.792
We just flew from Italy,
you said it'd be ready.

07:54.885 --> 07:56.709
I thought I was ready, man.
I thought I was,

07:56.810 --> 07:58.790
But I watched it
this morning and I'm not.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.113
Billy, listen,
I understand you're nervous.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.971
But we've both seen first cuts...
we know what we're looking at.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.118
I can't.
It's just not ready.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.072
You only get one chance
for a first impression.

08:08.126 --> 08:10.014
All right, look, here's the deal, okay?

08:10.095 --> 08:12.927
We see this film today or not another
dollar comes into this facility.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.760
Not for cigarettes,
not for coffee,

08:14.794 --> 08:16.729
Not for sea bass and
not for fucking blowjobs,

08:16.796 --> 08:18.241
Do you understand what I'm saying?

08:20.426 --> 08:21.666
Yeah, I do.

08:23.006 --> 08:24.974
Raul, prepare the projector.

08:26.902 --> 08:28.870
I'm just gonna piss
really quickly, okay?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.044
- Was I too harsh?
- No, perfect.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.616
Sorry, Vinnie!
Go fuck yourself, suit!

08:43.580 --> 08:44.901
Maybe you were a little harsh.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.670
- So?
- So.

08:50.209 --> 08:51.369
So.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.365
- This is awkward.
- What's awkward?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.159
We don't even know why we're here.

08:55.593 --> 08:56.780
But we are concerned.

08:57.213 --> 08:58.455
We're very concerned.

08:58.590 --> 08:59.812
I mean, we know Jonah

08:59.947 --> 09:02.806
Just had his evaluation.
But we thought it was a formality.

09:04.005 --> 09:05.302
I mean, he's a legacy.

09:05.707 --> 09:07.930
Well, his sister Sarah
has been a model student here

09:08.065 --> 09:09.620
for almost eight years.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.020
I mean, isn't a sibling
guaranteed admission?

09:12.728 --> 09:14.486
We can never make any guarantees.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.489
That's not what you said when
I was writing all those donation checks.

09:17.565 --> 09:21.151
So, was there a problem
with Jonah's evaluation?

09:21.406 --> 09:22.928
Well, he did hit a kid with a ruler.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.638
- Yes, he told us that.
- He told us all

09:24.692 --> 09:26.768
the kid was trying
to steal his power ranger.

09:26.930 --> 09:29.717
And I teach my son never to let
people just take things from him.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.685
It's my Israeli blood, okay?

09:31.739 --> 09:33.573
You can't tell us
that he might not be able

09:33.627 --> 09:36.714
- to go to school here because of that?
- I'm not telling you that.

09:36.926 --> 09:39.299
- this is just a courtesy.
- A courtesy?

09:40.291 --> 09:43.682
We want you to have time to apply
to another school, just in case.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.084
Just in case what?

09:45.185 --> 09:47.015
Just in case he doesn't get in.

09:47.673 --> 09:48.687
What a smug bitch.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.536
Just sitting there with that stupid look
on her stupid fucking face.

09:51.617 --> 09:54.179
- The cursing. We're at the school.
- I'm sorry, I'm upset.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.905
I know, it's kind of hot. I like it.

09:55.987 --> 09:58.197
- Ari, why aren't you upset?
- She's just a secretary,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.366
A low-level messenger.
No time to deal with that.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.766
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna go to our old buddy,

10:02.847 --> 10:04.076
Dr. Reich.
A higher level.

10:04.130 --> 10:06.939
- What can he do?
- He is on the board of trustees, baby.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.609
We didn't spend all those nights

10:08.742 --> 10:11.702
at his queer piano parties for nothing.
He'll take care of it.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.245
I think I should go with you.

10:13.329 --> 10:15.939
- Baby, this is man's work.
- Man's work?

10:16.020 --> 10:18.178
I am going to have to apply
a little bit of pressure.

10:18.205 --> 10:20.219
Trust me,
you do not want to see this, all right?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.969
Don't worry, I'm gonna handle it.

10:22.118 --> 10:23.359
Trust me.

10:35.271 --> 10:37.860
Damn, Drama,
this place is looking good.

10:38.337 --> 10:41.240
Yeah, and it's gonna keep looking
that way, so take your shoes off.

10:41.710 --> 10:43.442
You want me to take my shoes off?

10:43.981 --> 10:46.078
Everybody's gonna be
going shoeless tonight.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.814
So don't think your smelly feet
are getting any special attention.

10:49.019 --> 10:51.284
There's gonna be a sign right
there that says "no shoes"

10:51.338 --> 10:53.018
and a basket right there
to house them.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.170
You might want to get a sign
and a basket for bras,

10:55.278 --> 10:57.523
'cause these sorority girls,
they sound kinda freaky.

10:57.784 --> 10:59.159
They just better be neat.

11:00.564 --> 11:02.586
- Grab that end.
- Where's it going?

11:03.337 --> 11:04.955
In the bedroom.
It's only two weeks old,

11:05.009 --> 11:07.266
- I don't want anyone sitting on it.
- Are you for real?

11:07.303 --> 11:10.179
What kind of party is this gonna be
if people don't have a place to sit?

11:10.233 --> 11:12.768
First of all, I got sturdy folding
chairs in my storage closet.

11:12.795 --> 11:15.708
Second, I put way more into this
place than I could possibly afford.

11:15.947 --> 11:18.590
And I don't want my shit getting
destroyed, capisce?

11:18.945 --> 11:20.106
Let's go.

11:22.052 --> 11:23.590
Quit whinging, you pussy.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.864
You're boxing my cutlery after this.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.947
You really think
that was the only print?

11:30.123 --> 11:33.036
My spanish isn't great, but I believe
that's what the editor was saying.

11:33.618 --> 11:35.479
So what are our options
if we don't find him?

11:35.562 --> 11:38.030
- We get a new editor, start over.
- That could take months.

11:38.403 --> 11:40.857
That's why we got to find him.
This is it right here.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.509
- Hello, Kat.
- Hey, Vince.

11:50.850 --> 11:52.818
- E.
- How are you?

11:53.603 --> 11:56.348
Billy's ma is staying with us,
so as good as I can be.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.671
Close the door,
there's a chill coming through.

11:59.045 --> 12:00.663
It's 80° out.

12:01.663 --> 12:02.855
She's always complaining.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.857
What did you just say
about me, you little slut?

12:04.925 --> 12:08.227
Hey, this is my house. Don't
fucking talk to me that way, bitch!

12:08.511 --> 12:10.560
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

12:10.764 --> 12:12.050
My god.

12:12.914 --> 12:15.476
Man, I'm sorry.
The woman is crazy, you know?

12:16.254 --> 12:18.337
So, what's going on with you guys?
Everything okay?

12:18.371 --> 12:19.772
Yeah, we're looking for Billy.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.799
Wasn't he gonna meet
you guys for the screening?

12:21.879 --> 12:24.975
Yeah, he was. But he left
and he took the movie with him.

12:25.340 --> 12:26.743
I don't know where he is.

12:26.764 --> 12:29.175
Though he was a little down
when he left here this morning.

12:29.337 --> 12:31.783
He was? We spoke to him last night,
he sounded great.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.828
Yeah, he screened the movie
last night for me and his mother

12:34.936 --> 12:36.284
and I think it soured him.

12:36.426 --> 12:38.475
- You saw the movie?
- Oh yeah, a bunch of times.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.943
Was it good?

12:40.794 --> 12:41.927
Oh, I can't say.

12:41.996 --> 12:44.342
- You can't say if it was good?
- I can't say anything.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.202
Billy would kill me if I said anything,

12:46.256 --> 12:48.710
and you know,
I'd never betray Billy that way.

12:48.817 --> 12:50.435
So why was he so down this morning?

12:50.516 --> 12:52.290
Because of what she said,
fucking cooz.

12:52.425 --> 12:53.773
She didn't like it.

12:56.771 --> 12:57.931
That's him.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.714
Hey baby, where are you?

13:00.220 --> 13:01.945
Vince and E are, like, freaking out.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.922
No, I didn't call them, baby.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.589
Where are you?
Calm down.

13:10.896 --> 13:12.729
He hung up.
He's drunk.

13:13.243 --> 13:15.670
He said he's at the only place
where people really love him.

13:16.567 --> 13:17.888
Any idea where that might be?

13:17.969 --> 13:19.560
Yeah, the body shop, probably.

13:21.417 --> 13:22.835
- Thanks, Kat.
- See you, Kat.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.254
We'll see you later.

13:27.617 --> 13:29.675
- Hey, Frida.
- Yeah, he's in with someone.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.677
Oh, it's fine.
I'll tell him it's fine.

13:34.868 --> 13:36.647
Your office said
you didn't want to see me.

13:36.701 --> 13:38.317
I just saw you for
a cleaning last week.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.619
- No, it's not for my teeth.
- Oh no, what then?

13:40.687 --> 13:42.915
They've giving Jonah
a hard time over at school.

13:43.424 --> 13:44.657
Hard time, huh?

13:44.791 --> 13:46.728
He hit a kid with a ruler
at his evaluation.

13:46.809 --> 13:48.616
Now they're telling me
he may not get in.

13:48.828 --> 13:49.953
I see.

13:50.569 --> 13:52.731
You know, you're on the board
and I need help.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.267
I really...
really can't, Ari.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.002
What do you mean, you can't?

13:57.259 --> 13:59.200
I can't even talk about this, Ari.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.774
Talk abo what?
You already know something about this?

14:01.841 --> 14:02.979
I'm with a patient.

14:04.704 --> 14:07.656
I'm the guy that got Lindsay Lohan
to screen <i>Mean Girls</i> at the school

14:07.737 --> 14:08.948
when you begged.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.525
I'm the guy that got Lil' Bow
at your daughter's bat mitzvah.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.451
I'm the guy that knows
you got a little skank

14:13.559 --> 14:15.150
you keep on the wilshire corridor.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.455
This stays here.

14:16.749 --> 14:18.097
What are you not telling me?

14:21.658 --> 14:24.001
Look, I got two more kids
that I got to get into school.

14:24.055 --> 14:26.320
Being on the board alone
does not guarantee that.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.634
You need to talk
to the headmaster about this.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.066
About what?

14:31.971 --> 14:33.131
Goodbye.

14:33.808 --> 14:36.397
The ruler incident
is not your son's only problem.

14:37.409 --> 14:40.326
- What are you talking about?
- Talk to Andrew Preston.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.581
Please, I cannot say
anything more... I am sorry...

14:42.682 --> 14:44.155
- But...
- I am sorry.

14:46.747 --> 14:48.392
Hope you had a nice nap, Turtle.

14:48.802 --> 14:51.627
What's the problem? You look like
you got it all under control.

14:51.735 --> 14:53.569
I gotta get rest
if we're gonna go all night.

14:53.623 --> 14:54.782
All night?

14:55.375 --> 14:56.682
- Let's hope so.
- Whatever.

14:56.736 --> 14:58.677
Just get over here
and give me a hand with this.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.430
You're taking down the light fixture?

15:00.484 --> 15:03.247
It's a chandelier, and yes,
I don't want anyone swinging from it.

15:03.738 --> 15:06.057
- You got it at Ikea.
- Whatever, just grab it.

15:06.623 --> 15:08.149
Hold on, I got to take a piss.

15:08.519 --> 15:10.677
6-2-4-9-8-7.

15:11.723 --> 15:13.979
6-2-4-9-8-7.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.430
It's the combo.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.750
Are you fucking serious?

15:21.804 --> 15:23.179
Deadly serious, Turtle.

15:23.265 --> 15:24.667
You are ruining this party.

15:24.721 --> 15:27.040
By stopping 200 people
from shitting on my toilet?

15:27.121 --> 15:29.980
- I don't think I'm ruining anything.
- Who shits at a party?

15:30.380 --> 15:31.426
Well, even just piss.

15:31.507 --> 15:33.718
What do drunk people do?
They piss and they miss.

15:34.551 --> 15:36.738
That's imported Italian
limestone in there.

15:36.954 --> 15:38.815
It's porous and it's not
getting pissed on.

15:39.056 --> 15:41.323
So where is everyone supposed to go?
Off the balcony?

15:41.404 --> 15:43.427
Don't be retarded.
I got porta potties coming.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.137
You do not.

15:45.218 --> 15:48.076
I do too. In fact,
they should be here any minute.

15:48.350 --> 15:50.400
- So why don't you hold it?
- Fuck that!

15:50.507 --> 15:51.910
I'm not holding shit.

15:52.287 --> 15:53.716
Do you remember the combo?

15:54.971 --> 15:58.065
I will piss all over your plasma.
I swear to god.

15:59.744 --> 16:01.712
6-2-4-9-8-7.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.411
And wash your hands thoroughly.

16:03.492 --> 16:04.948
We got to wrap up my frette linens.

16:05.002 --> 16:06.928
Let's just do this thing
at Vince's hotel.

16:07.247 --> 16:08.919
Turtle, it's my baby bro's party

16:09.026 --> 16:10.348
And I'm hosting it.

16:10.483 --> 16:12.775
Do you really think I would
not let it be off the hook?

16:12.883 --> 16:14.576
Now stop it.
It's gonna be perfect.

16:15.654 --> 16:18.890
30 more minutes,
this place will be indestructible.

16:20.845 --> 16:22.733
Why are you worried
about what his mother says?

16:22.760 --> 16:24.351
'cause she's the only one who's seen it.

16:24.431 --> 16:25.855
She hated <i>Queens boulevard</i>.

16:25.936 --> 16:27.662
- That's true.
- So relax.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.659
- Marvin.
- Deep breath.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.647
It's your underappreciated
money manager, Eric.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.138
We appreciate you, Marvin.

16:39.219 --> 16:41.754
Then how come you don't
listen to a fucking word I say?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.075
Will you stop yelling at me?

16:43.129 --> 16:45.046
<i>$1200 a night on a hotel suite...</i>

16:45.154 --> 16:46.664
Are you out of your fucking mind?

16:46.745 --> 16:48.660
Relax. It only temporary.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.970
<i>Temporary?
Yeah, I'll say it'semporary.</i>

16:51.244 --> 16:53.104
Till they throw you out on your ass!

16:53.239 --> 16:55.208
You guys have no money!

16:55.316 --> 16:57.375
<i>Why do you think I told you
to get back from Italy?</i>

16:57.422 --> 16:58.429
- I know.
- <i>Hey, listen.</i>

16:58.478 --> 17:00.986
This is not conservative Marvin talking.

17:01.268 --> 17:05.852
This is you-are-really-
and-truly-broke Marvin talking.

17:06.417 --> 17:09.464
Living on Vince's black card is insane.

17:09.882 --> 17:11.877
- I know.
- So does Ari have a job?

17:12.119 --> 17:13.656
We got to wait till we see the movie.

17:13.738 --> 17:15.611
- Did you see it?
- We're seeing it today.

17:15.665 --> 17:16.743
- There he is.
- <i>When?</i>

17:16.798 --> 17:18.523
- Right now.
- Call me when it's over...

17:22.592 --> 17:24.978
Hey, Vince. I didn't know
you were back in town.

17:25.059 --> 17:26.300
- Hey.
- No call?

17:26.378 --> 17:27.566
Sorry, Mia.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.179
- I mean, this is just silly.
- Fucking guy.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.202
Well, do you think it's his reading?

17:35.413 --> 17:37.112
I know it is.
We don't do enough of it.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.269
- Well I try.
- A little less <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>,

17:39.323 --> 17:41.130
a little more
<i>Good Night Moon</i>, perhaps.

17:41.238 --> 17:43.394
- You're blaming me?
- No, I'm blaming me

17:43.474 --> 17:46.342
who comes home with 40 scripts
a night after working a full day.

17:46.396 --> 17:48.418
Hey, you know what?
I'll read one of those to him.

17:48.445 --> 17:50.531
Tonight I got <i>Saw IV</i>. He'll love it.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.257
Baby, don't worry.

17:52.284 --> 17:54.010
I will save the day as usual.

17:54.118 --> 17:56.801
Excuse me, sir. Cell phones
are not permitted on school grounds.

17:56.882 --> 17:58.905
Let me call you back.
Andrew Preston?

17:59.529 --> 18:02.009
- Ari gold.
- Just the man I was looking for.

18:02.265 --> 18:03.893
Sorry about the phone...
business call.

18:03.974 --> 18:05.484
It is a Wednesday after all.

18:06.536 --> 18:08.423
Well, what can I do for you, Mr. Gold?

18:09.771 --> 18:11.039
I'm sorry to bother you.

18:11.140 --> 18:13.955
It's just that I had a meeting
with your executive assistant today.

18:13.982 --> 18:15.141
And...

18:15.276 --> 18:17.326
Look, I understand that
the evaluation for my son

18:17.380 --> 18:18.933
didn't go as well as expected,

18:18.987 --> 18:21.683
But I need to assure you
that my wife and I

18:21.926 --> 18:24.056
are committed to doing whatever it takes

18:24.387 --> 18:25.812
to bring our son up to speed.

18:26.387 --> 18:28.275
Perhaps he is a little behind
on his reading

18:28.328 --> 18:30.297
but I mean, hey,
he's not even six yet.

18:30.405 --> 18:32.346
Okay? You can't really
judge him on his reading.

18:32.836 --> 18:35.637
At six I was dyslexic. You would have
thrown me out in the cold.

18:35.745 --> 18:37.983
Look at me now.
I'm like the poster boy for this place.

18:38.010 --> 18:39.736
- It's not his reading.
- What is it then?

18:39.737 --> 18:41.398
His rhyming,
his fine motor skills?

18:41.492 --> 18:42.894
- It's none of that.
- What is it?

18:43.137 --> 18:45.348
I can't discuss it until
the process is complete.

18:45.429 --> 18:47.074
- You understand.
- Actually I don't.

18:48.284 --> 18:53.687
Mr. Preston, I have spent over $200,000
in tuition over the past eight years,

18:53.822 --> 18:55.478
another 50 or so in donations.

18:55.532 --> 18:57.743
My wife has served on
50 different committees.

18:58.021 --> 19:00.846
All right, that's two less days a week
she gets to Barry's boot camp.

19:00.981 --> 19:04.486
She sacrifices her body; obviously
a sacrifice that I make as well,

19:04.594 --> 19:05.871
All for the good of this school.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.431
Now, why don't you tell me what type
of new donation I have to make

19:09.619 --> 19:11.414
to ensure that I never
have to think about

19:11.548 --> 19:14.137
any type of limitations
you think my son has.

19:14.185 --> 19:15.668
Look, Mr. Gold, the thing is...

19:15.695 --> 19:17.556
- $20,000.
- Mr. Gold.

19:17.610 --> 19:19.201
- $30,000!
- Mr. Gold...

19:19.308 --> 19:20.852
It is not your son.

19:22.442 --> 19:23.683
It is his father:

19:24.499 --> 19:27.466
A cell phone on your ear every time
I see you walk through these halls;

19:27.936 --> 19:29.447
A foul mouth on the soccer field

19:29.527 --> 19:31.388
every time I see you
root for your daughter.

19:31.469 --> 19:34.766
This school has simply decided that
your daughter has only four years left.

19:34.927 --> 19:38.163
But if we admit your son, that means
more than a decade left with you.

19:39.361 --> 19:40.466
Good day.

19:53.819 --> 19:54.877
Daddy.

19:54.978 --> 19:57.346
- Get your stuff, sweetheart.
- Everything okay, mr. Gold?

19:58.387 --> 19:59.412
What's going on, daddy?

19:59.495 --> 20:01.356
Nothing, you just
no longer go to school here.

20:01.464 --> 20:02.650
What?

20:19.084 --> 20:20.999
Don't be afraid to use a coaster, pal.

20:21.946 --> 20:24.777
Hey asshole!
There's nothing in the sub-zero.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.195
There's no need to even open it.

20:27.914 --> 20:29.020
Fucking animals.

20:29.846 --> 20:30.920
So is it like the movies?

20:30.974 --> 20:34.212
Where the girls make you do all sorts
of crazy things to get into a sorority?

20:34.292 --> 20:37.852
Oh yeah. They didn't let us sleep
for 24 hours on initiation night.

20:38.575 --> 20:40.408
No, I meant like crazy sexual things.

20:42.193 --> 20:43.514
We can sell my car.

20:43.927 --> 20:45.788
No, it's important
to keep up appearances.

20:45.949 --> 20:47.487
Great.
'cause I love that car.

20:48.727 --> 20:50.075
We are all good.

20:50.187 --> 20:51.859
We know the movie's great.
We were there.

20:51.913 --> 20:54.475
- Yeah, we were.
- How was your day? Mine sucked

20:54.555 --> 20:56.726
and no one called me all day.
Did you see the movie?

20:57.344 --> 20:59.103
- I'm gonna call Walsh again.
- What?

20:59.480 --> 21:01.853
- Is there a problem?
- Hey, shoes off, Ari!

21:01.907 --> 21:03.574
Hey, fuck you, Drama!

21:05.549 --> 21:06.897
Hey Billy.
It's E.

21:07.804 --> 21:09.288
<i>Look, I'm calling for Vince.</i>

21:09.652 --> 21:10.993
<i>I know you hate me, Billy.</i>

21:11.339 --> 21:14.440
Vince put his entire career on the line
for this movie and for you...

21:14.657 --> 21:16.693
And all of his money.
He's got none.

21:17.119 --> 21:19.034
And he can't get a job
until people see this.

21:20.014 --> 21:22.661
<i>So I'm not asking anything for me,
but for Vince.</i>

21:23.309 --> 21:25.250
<i>What does Vince
have to do to see this movie?</i>

21:28.751 --> 21:30.315
He has to be gentle, suit.

21:37.781 --> 21:39.673
- Just calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

21:39.727 --> 21:42.551
Someone's in my bathroom and
I want to know how they got in there.

21:43.374 --> 21:45.087
- Don't look at me.
- Don't look at you?

21:45.566 --> 21:47.399
That's a nickel-plated master lock

21:47.536 --> 21:49.012
With hardened steel shackles.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.385
It's impossible to get in there
without a combo!

21:51.578 --> 21:53.287
Maybe David Copperfield is in there.

21:53.830 --> 21:55.127
Oh, that's funny.

22:04.873 --> 22:06.653
She promised to show me her tits.

22:07.906 --> 22:09.363
Fucking sellout.

22:10.531 --> 22:11.825
What's the problem, Johnny?

22:11.956 --> 22:13.790
No problem, bro.
Having the time of my life.

22:13.844 --> 22:16.251
- You having a good time?
- Great time, great time.

22:16.352 --> 22:18.358
- Listen, we're gonna take off.
- You leaving?

22:18.466 --> 22:20.896
Yeah, Walsh promised
to show us the movie right now.

22:21.014 --> 22:23.258
I don't want him to change his mind...
you understand?

22:23.359 --> 22:24.433
I understand, bro.

22:24.487 --> 22:26.213
Have a good time.
Good luck, good luck.

22:26.294 --> 22:28.532
- See you guys later.
- All right. See you later, buddy.

22:28.586 --> 22:30.233
Bye-bye now.
I'll see you guys.

22:30.529 --> 22:32.417
Bye, you guys.
Bye, bye.

22:36.671 --> 22:37.831
Everyone!

22:38.563 --> 22:40.127
I have an announcement to make!

22:41.155 --> 22:42.530
Get the fuck out.

22:45.149 --> 22:48.024
No, I'm serious.
The party's over. Get the fuck out!

22:48.562 --> 22:50.233
And head over to my house!

22:50.322 --> 22:52.372
After-party
at Vinnie Chase's hotel room!

23:04.933 --> 23:06.309
No words necessary.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.039
Roll it, Raul.
Enjoy.

23:10.937 --> 23:12.582
I'll be throwing up in the alley.

23:41.304 --> 23:43.474
I mean, a person
is only as good as their word.

23:43.771 --> 23:46.419
I mean, without that
we'd just be animals.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.081
Fine.

23:49.149 --> 23:50.308
You happy?

23:50.961 --> 23:52.876
Sadly, I'm very happy.

23:53.449 --> 23:54.797
Anybody seen Drama?

23:54.984 --> 23:56.737
Excuse me, excuse me.
Get out of the way.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.675
... picture.
It's a little something...

24:00.223 --> 24:02.457
Someone did something
really horrible in the bathroom.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.989
What do you want me to do about it, bro?

24:06.837 --> 24:08.671
Hey, Lloyd, nice sweater, baby.

24:09.529 --> 24:11.174
- What's up, Drama?
- How are you, pal?

24:11.228 --> 24:12.536
Good, man.
Honey, hold this.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.435
Hysterical.

24:47.890 --> 24:49.211
Please say something.

24:51.515 --> 24:52.890
Ah... I'm blown away, Billy.

24:54.381 --> 24:55.648
Oh you!

24:58.749 --> 24:59.882
Suit?

25:00.116 --> 25:02.355
- Great job, Billy.
- God, you little...!

25:15.955 --> 25:17.384
So we're on the same page, right?

25:17.465 --> 25:19.869
- You were just being nice to Billy.
- What do you mean?

25:19.940 --> 25:21.707
You didn't really
like the movie, did you?

25:21.787 --> 25:23.459
I thought it was amazing.
You didn't?

25:23.610 --> 25:24.743
I thought it sucked.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.145
- Really?
- Really.

25:29.245 --> 25:30.672
Hey, what's up, Turtle?

25:33.207 --> 25:34.663
Great, no,
that's fucking awesome.

25:35.391 --> 25:37.873
- What happened?
- They had an after-party at the hotel.

25:37.981 --> 25:40.516
Anthony Michael hall pissed off
the balcony, we got thrown out.

25:40.597 --> 25:42.440
- Nice.
- So what do you want to do?

25:42.547 --> 25:45.327
We'll crash at Johnny's tonight.
So you really didn't like it?

25:45.516 --> 25:46.945
I really didn't.
