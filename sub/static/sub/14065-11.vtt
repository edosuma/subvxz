WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:05.083
Clarice. You're applying
for the assistant position?

00:05.118 --> 00:06.665
I have skills.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.178
Are you okay?

00:08.213 --> 00:10.628
I walk down the street,
anything I pass in pants,

00:10.628 --> 00:11.919
I want to have sex.

00:11.954 --> 00:13.246
How engaged are you?

00:13.246 --> 00:14.019
Very.

00:14.054 --> 00:15.465
It's called friends with benefits.

00:15.465 --> 00:18.273
I have never had that kind of friend before.

00:18.273 --> 00:19.656
Let me see your underwear, Denise.

00:19.656 --> 00:20.478
Get out.

00:20.513 --> 00:22.680
–I hear you're in heat.
–It seems so.

00:22.680 --> 00:23.929
I'm taking you to Nimmo bay.

00:23.929 --> 00:25.054
What are you doing in my bed?

00:25.054 --> 00:26.321
I'm gonna take you to my spa.

00:26.321 --> 00:27.636
Almost as good as fishing.

00:27.636 --> 00:28.916
–Who are we?
–Denny Crane.

00:28.916 --> 00:30.103
Alan Shore.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.909 --> 00:48.943
–Alan.
–You sent for me, Shirley.

00:48.943 --> 00:50.768
–I did.
–I'm not surprised.

00:50.803 --> 00:53.732
You've had that look about you all day,

00:53.767 --> 00:58.089
showing a few cracks and creases
in your wall de résistance.

00:58.124 --> 00:59.303
Maybe I should botox.

00:59.303 --> 01:02.568
So you wait till after hours,
then summon me,

01:02.603 --> 01:08.687
no doubt to go spelunking into
your darkest, most loving place.

01:08.722 --> 01:11.145
Alan, this is Vanessa Walker.

01:11.816 --> 01:13.504
Interesting to meet you.

01:13.539 --> 01:14.987
She's from our New York office.

01:14.987 --> 01:17.008
She's handled cases
all over the country,

01:17.008 --> 01:20.031
many of them high-profile, as is
the one that starts Wednesday.

01:20.031 --> 01:23.666
Right, and what does this
have to do with me and you?

01:23.701 --> 01:27.301
She's of the impression
she can't win this trial.

01:27.336 --> 01:30.705
That's not completely accurate.
I said it was a long shot.

01:30.705 --> 01:32.024
And she's come to me

01:32.024 --> 01:34.171
because, well, she's heard of you.

01:34.171 --> 01:37.480
I've heard you're a bit of a miracle worker
with the underdog.

01:37.480 --> 01:40.755
I need somebody to first establish
my client as an underdog,

01:40.755 --> 01:42.659
not easy because she's doctor,

01:42.659 --> 01:44.451
and then keep her out of prison.

01:44.451 --> 01:46.527
What did she do, your client?

01:46.562 --> 01:48.603
She euthanized five patients.

01:48.638 --> 01:50.470
Allegedly.
–I'm sure.

01:50.505 --> 01:52.886
And she's going on trial here in Boston?

01:52.886 --> 01:53.779
New Orleans.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.539
This would be a road trip.

01:55.798 --> 01:58.667
Her hospital lost all services
after Katrina hit.

01:58.667 --> 02:01.502
She had five patients faced
with very painful deaths

02:01.502 --> 02:02.939
if she didn't do something, so…

02:02.939 --> 02:04.957
The flight will get you in tomorrow at 4.

02:04.957 --> 02:07.372
You'll be using an office of
local counsel while there.

02:07.372 --> 02:08.449
I just heard.

02:08.485 --> 02:09.493
New Orleans!

02:09.527 --> 02:11.983
My penis is already packed.

02:12.018 --> 02:14.413
Denny, I would love for you to join,

02:14.448 --> 02:17.569
but this particular excursion
is a rather serious one.

02:17.569 --> 02:19.366
Maybe you and I could go another time.

02:19.366 --> 02:20.325
Are you nuts?

02:20.360 --> 02:22.319
That damn tornado wiped out
half the place.

02:22.319 --> 02:23.558
There's no time like the present.

02:23.558 --> 02:26.609
Alan, we must seize
the hookers, uh, the day.

02:26.644 --> 02:28.345
You know, Denny, technically,

02:28.345 --> 02:31.357
it wasn't so much a tornado
as a hurricane.

02:31.392 --> 02:33.278
And you're holding a kazoo.

02:33.313 --> 02:35.755
Not just any kazoo, a trombone kazoo.

02:35.783 --> 02:42.383
A go-to-New-Orleans-under-the-pretext
-of-some-legal-case-to-play-with
-a-Dixieland-band kazoo.

02:42.418 --> 02:44.090
I only have two plane tickets.

02:44.090 --> 02:46.094
Oh, gee, and I only have a Gulfstream.

02:46.094 --> 02:48.064
I think Denny wants to come, Vanessa.

02:48.064 --> 02:49.545
Denny Crane.

02:50.410 --> 02:52.403
Down on the bayou.

03:53.380 --> 03:57.062
The hospital was becoming toxic
from human waste piling up,

03:57.062 --> 03:59.540
rotting corpses.

03:59.818 --> 04:01.842
What about the five patients who died?

04:01.842 --> 04:04.149
They were in very bad shape.

04:04.184 --> 04:08.006
I scrounged up some sedatives
that the looters hadn't taken,

04:08.006 --> 04:11.395
and I gave them enough
to induce sleep.

04:11.430 --> 04:14.785
I did what I could
to manage their pain.

04:14.820 --> 04:18.454
Alan, is this gonna take long?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.868
Denny, this is the client.

04:25.903 --> 04:28.770
The trial starts tomorrow.
–I know.

04:30.107 --> 04:32.519
But I feel ready. Don't you?

04:33.864 --> 04:38.029
Tell you what, why don't you head
over to Bourbon street, check us in,

04:38.029 --> 04:39.613
and I'll meet you there?

04:39.645 --> 04:40.960
All right.

04:40.995 --> 04:44.843
And if I'm not there, I'm,
uh, out, uh, you know…

04:44.878 --> 04:47.210
–Seizing the day.
–Right. Shh…

04:51.002 --> 04:53.620
Denny's going to get
a jump on some…

04:53.655 --> 04:55.404
research.

04:56.965 --> 05:01.347
Dr Follette, when doctors
induce a patient's death,

05:01.382 --> 05:05.475
they tend to say they're managing pain.

05:05.510 --> 05:07.621
I understand that.

05:07.656 --> 05:09.732
No doubt a jury will.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.918
The problem here is,

05:11.953 --> 05:16.986
our whole case comes down
to your moral integrity.

05:17.021 --> 05:22.406
It would therefore be my advice
to just come clean with the jury

05:22.441 --> 05:27.180
and admit you euthanized
some suffering patients.

05:27.890 --> 05:31.092
I managed their pain.

05:47.031 --> 05:49.194
My phone keeps making
that ringing noise,

05:49.194 --> 05:51.322
and there's nobody there to pick it up.

05:51.322 --> 05:52.619
Sorry.

05:52.864 --> 05:54.615
Clarence, what are you doing?

05:54.615 --> 05:56.331
Just reading. I'll get back.

05:56.331 --> 05:59.518
You're reading up on title IX cases?

05:59.553 --> 06:03.110
You've been doing that all week.
What is going on?

06:04.007 --> 06:08.297
I, uh… got kicked out of my gym.

06:09.093 --> 06:11.406
It's an all-girls gym.

06:11.441 --> 06:15.118
I started going, you know,
as me instead of Clarice,

06:15.153 --> 06:16.666
and I got expelled.

06:16.701 --> 06:19.893
Well, if it's an all-girls gym…

06:19.894 --> 06:23.410
They knew Clarice was really…

06:23.822 --> 06:27.638
So I think I should have
some kind of estoppel claim.

06:27.673 --> 06:30.222
All my friends…

06:32.766 --> 06:35.803
I'm lonely as Clarence.

06:36.136 --> 06:37.139
I want to sue.

06:37.174 --> 06:41.016
But it's an all-girls gym.

06:41.051 --> 06:42.822
I want to sue.

06:51.592 --> 06:54.484
So, Denise, any new year's resolutions?

06:54.519 --> 06:57.015
–None. You?
–Three, actually.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.512
Eat right, exercise more, date you.

07:00.394 --> 07:01.702
I, I'm sorry. What was that last one?

07:01.702 --> 07:02.788
Date you.

07:02.823 --> 07:06.590
I think enough time has elapsed
since Daniel Post's death.

07:06.590 --> 07:08.302
Thoughts?

07:09.943 --> 07:11.473
Uh, okay.

07:11.508 --> 07:14.025
–First, and don't take this the wrong way.
–Okay.

07:14.025 --> 07:15.847
I don't like you.

07:18.167 --> 07:21.099
–Not at all?
–Not really.

07:21.330 --> 07:24.392
Well, most of the women I date
don't like me, actually,

07:24.392 --> 07:27.357
at least not at the beginning or the end,

07:27.392 --> 07:30.724
but there is a middle part
when things are great.

07:30.759 --> 07:32.384
Think on it, sleep on it,

07:32.384 --> 07:33.618
pray on it.

07:33.653 --> 07:34.853
Let me know.

07:41.369 --> 07:43.935
It's an all-girls gym.

07:43.970 --> 07:48.311
Are you saying all these years, you
thought Clarice was really a woman?

07:48.311 --> 07:49.073
Yes.

07:49.108 --> 07:51.738
Maybe not biologically,
but in every other way.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.061
So you've known all along

07:53.061 --> 07:55.400
that you've been dealing
with a biological male?

07:55.400 --> 07:58.017
Look, we all love Clarice,

07:58.052 --> 08:00.589
as long as the male thing
wasn't waved in our faces.

08:00.589 --> 08:02.305
But when he shows up as a man…

08:02.305 --> 08:03.889
So what? What's changed?

08:03.899 --> 08:06.790
Well, what's changed is
we'd have to let all men in.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.034
He has been a member of this club,

08:09.054 --> 08:11.213
a valued member for seven years.

08:11.248 --> 08:15.341
You can't expect him to forfeit that, just
because he changed his appearance.

08:15.341 --> 08:16.548
Well, I'm sorry.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.294
Well, then, we're suing you.

08:19.329 --> 08:20.738
On what grounds?

08:20.773 --> 08:22.876
Gender discrimination.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.946
I should have known. Trombone section.

09:01.631 --> 09:05.197
So what's Louisiana's pulse
on assisted suicide?

09:05.232 --> 09:06.303
Lousy.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.186
The state is overwhelmingly against it,

09:08.186 --> 09:11.492
and even if we tried to convince
the jury on that issue,

09:11.492 --> 09:12.953
we have another problem.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.087
Me?

09:14.122 --> 09:16.261
Is everything always about you?

09:16.296 --> 09:19.127
Shirley didn't tell you that part?

09:19.162 --> 09:21.958
These patients didn't ask to die.

09:22.425 --> 09:23.550
What do you mean?

09:23.585 --> 09:24.930
They wanted to be rescued.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.956
They didn't ask to be pain-managed
to another place.

09:27.956 --> 09:31.575
There was no request on anyone's
part to be put out of one's misery?

09:31.575 --> 09:33.798
No, these patients were
either in too much pain

09:33.798 --> 09:37.220
or too incoherent to make any request.

09:37.255 --> 09:39.077
You didn't tell me this.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.899
Well, I'm telling you now.

09:42.004 --> 09:43.908
Vanessa, you need to
round up some doctors

09:43.908 --> 09:46.921
who will say they would have done
exactly what Dr Follette did.

09:46.921 --> 09:49.007
On what relevance can we admit them?

09:49.007 --> 09:50.802
Standard of care.

09:50.837 --> 09:52.946
You'll think of something.

09:53.453 --> 09:55.135
We could always call him,

09:55.170 --> 09:57.620
put him up there with his kazoo.

09:58.422 --> 10:01.511
Find me those doctors,
or we may have to.

10:01.854 --> 10:03.060
Ready now!

10:13.154 --> 10:15.945
The cheapest and most
efficient way to do this,

10:15.945 --> 10:19.215
if you're still serious, is
to get injunctive relief.

10:19.215 --> 10:21.568
Assuming your goal
isn't about the money,

10:21.568 --> 10:23.282
but to get back into the club.

10:23.282 --> 10:24.723
Am I right?
–Yes.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.887
Okay.

10:26.386 --> 10:28.437
We take Sandy's deposition.

10:28.472 --> 10:31.202
Then we go into court, and
we try and get an order.

10:31.202 --> 10:33.350
But here's where it gets
a little tricky.

10:33.350 --> 10:35.392
The club has no duty to Clarence.

10:35.392 --> 10:37.808
Clarice is the one who had the membership.

10:37.808 --> 10:39.260
What's the difference?

10:39.274 --> 10:40.671
A big one, actually.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.454
Bottom line, for the purpose
of this lawsuit,

10:43.454 --> 10:46.261
you will have to be Clarice again.

10:46.296 --> 10:47.027
Okay.

10:47.062 --> 10:50.319
Do not be calling the defendant a “ho.”

10:52.092 --> 10:53.828
May I ask, do you not like me

10:53.828 --> 10:57.052
because I come off as kind
of a slick snake oil salesman?

10:57.052 --> 10:58.652
No, I've made my peace with that.

10:58.652 --> 11:01.819
Is it because I sometimes get a dopey
baby Huey expression on my face?

11:01.819 --> 11:03.156
That's actually kind of cute.

11:03.156 --> 11:04.511
So what is it then?

11:04.546 --> 11:05.928
What, that's it? You're giving up?

11:05.928 --> 11:06.903
The way I dress?

11:06.903 --> 11:07.442
No.

11:07.443 --> 11:08.889
–My hair?
–Getting closer.

11:08.889 --> 11:10.192
The Elvis sideburns?

11:10.192 --> 11:11.063
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

11:11.063 --> 11:13.385
So that's it. You don't like me
just because of my sideburns.

11:13.385 --> 11:15.309
It's not just the sideburns.

11:15.344 --> 11:17.113
My nasal voice?

11:17.341 --> 11:19.507
What is it? I've covered all the biggies.

11:19.507 --> 11:21.639
Slick, cocky, dopey, narcissistic, nasally.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.279
Oh, a lummox?

11:23.314 --> 11:26.350
I think it's just the whole package.

11:27.971 --> 11:29.127
I'm good in bed.

11:29.162 --> 11:30.285
That's a nice line.

11:30.285 --> 11:32.602
No, seriously. I'm really good.

11:32.637 --> 11:34.296
I've had women loathe me,

11:34.331 --> 11:37.322
yet still be unable to give up the sex.

11:45.535 --> 11:47.720
The post-mortem evidence revealed

11:47.755 --> 11:52.593
that five of the victims had died from a
combination of morphine and midazolam.

11:52.593 --> 11:54.700
Now these drugs are both
pain killers, are they not, doc?

11:54.700 --> 11:57.999
Yes, but administered
together in high doses,

11:58.034 --> 11:58.928
they're lethal.

11:58.928 --> 12:00.947
They would most certainly result in death.

12:00.947 --> 12:03.137
So this didn't strike you
as an accidental overdose?

12:03.137 --> 12:04.338
No. In my opinion,

12:04.373 --> 12:07.920
the administer of these drugs
intended for those patients to die.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.484
Well, now, doctor, to be fair,

12:09.484 --> 12:11.438
these were pretty dire circumstances.

12:11.438 --> 12:15.492
Which is when a patient most needs
to count on his doctor to fight for him.

12:15.492 --> 12:21.672
There never comes a time when
things get so tough, we just kill them.

12:22.145 --> 12:23.663
Doctor, you're aware of

12:23.695 --> 12:28.149
just how dire the circumstances were
in that hospital after Katrina hit.

12:28.149 --> 12:28.856
Yes.

12:28.891 --> 12:31.421
No electricity, no water,

12:31.456 --> 12:34.072
100° heat, no ventilation.

12:34.107 --> 12:36.653
Can you state to a medical certainty

12:36.688 --> 12:41.631
that those five patients were not
terminal under those horrid conditions?

12:41.666 --> 12:43.431
They could have survived.

12:43.466 --> 12:47.366
17 other patients, many
of them far less sick,

12:47.401 --> 12:48.943
had already died of dehydration.

12:48.943 --> 12:50.451
Do you know that?
–I do.

12:50.451 --> 12:51.911
In excruciating pain.

12:51.946 --> 12:54.254
–I wasn't there. I can't know.
–You can't know?

12:54.254 --> 12:55.940
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

12:55.940 --> 12:58.583
but when a person dies of dehydration,

12:58.618 --> 13:00.717
the tongue swells and cracks,

13:00.752 --> 13:04.035
the urine becomes highly concentrated
and burns out the bladder,

13:04.035 --> 13:07.284
while the stomach lining dries up,
causing uncontrollable retching.

13:07.284 --> 13:09.493
Finally, the brain cells dry out,

13:09.528 --> 13:11.866
and the patient convulses
until their heart seizes.

13:11.866 --> 13:13.205
Is that about right?
–Yes.

13:13.205 --> 13:15.121
And what if a patient starves to death?

13:15.121 --> 13:16.554
Would that be equally as gruesome?

13:16.554 --> 13:17.848
–Probably.
–And sepsis?

13:17.848 --> 13:20.455
–It would also be painful.
–Thank you.

13:20.490 --> 13:22.824
And, doctor, when my client says

13:22.859 --> 13:29.758
that those five patients were looking
at that very type of excruciating death,

13:29.793 --> 13:33.009
do you have any medical
evidence to contradict that?

13:33.009 --> 13:34.989
No, as I said, I wasn't there.

13:34.992 --> 13:36.914
In fact, many doctors were not there.

13:36.914 --> 13:38.802
In fact, most doctors were not there.

13:38.802 --> 13:39.964
Most got the hell out.

13:39.964 --> 13:41.743
Dr Follette, on the other hand,

13:41.743 --> 13:44.767
decided to stay and do whatever she could.

13:44.802 --> 13:48.508
Which was, in this case, to give
her patients lethal injections.

13:48.508 --> 13:52.791
Doctor, the drugs she injected are
commonly used together as an anesthetic.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.237
You'll of course correct me if I'm wrong.

13:54.237 --> 13:56.332
At that dosage, they are lethal.

13:56.332 --> 13:57.632
–Always?
–Almost always.

13:57.632 --> 13:58.998
“Almost”?

13:59.033 --> 14:02.313
We like to get it ‘exactly’
in a court of law, doctor.

14:02.313 --> 14:03.519
Objection.

14:03.554 --> 14:04.950
Nothing further.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.428
Are you ready?

14:26.463 --> 14:27.692
Ready for what?

14:27.693 --> 14:30.082
Pat O'Brien's. I got
some reservations.

14:30.082 --> 14:32.436
Oh, my God, Denny,
it's almost 10 o'clock.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.193
We're at trial in the morning.

14:34.193 --> 14:35.881
Hey, Alan, this is New Orleans,

14:35.881 --> 14:38.969
the city that laughs in the face of death.

14:39.194 --> 14:41.718
And right now they need a good laugh.

14:41.753 --> 14:42.999
Let's go to Pat's,

14:43.034 --> 14:45.047
and then we'll hit a few after-hours spots.

14:45.047 --> 14:46.325
Denny.

14:47.606 --> 14:53.456
I'm not gonna presume you were paying
attention in court today, were you?

14:53.491 --> 14:55.179
In and out.

14:55.214 --> 14:56.500
You were hungover.

14:56.535 --> 14:58.206
It happens.

14:59.407 --> 15:03.602
From whatever you happened to notice,

15:03.816 --> 15:06.474
how do you think it went?

15:08.161 --> 15:10.227
I think…

15:10.737 --> 15:13.230
you're trying this case
as if you were in Boston,

15:13.230 --> 15:15.112
and you're not.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.239
What does that mean?

15:21.082 --> 15:24.171
Up is down here, Alan.

15:24.384 --> 15:26.254
Down is up.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.753
That's how you try this case.

15:38.346 --> 15:40.773
Penny for that thought.

15:41.313 --> 15:42.898
Hi, Shirley.

15:43.293 --> 15:44.274
You okay?

15:44.309 --> 15:46.804
Yeah. No. Uh…

15:47.518 --> 15:50.127
Jeffrey Coho asked me out.

15:50.162 --> 15:51.112
Excuse me?

15:51.147 --> 15:57.455
Yeah. In the last month, Alan Shore,
Jeffrey Coho, Brad, still.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.435
I must be doing something
right with my hair.

16:00.435 --> 16:03.311
Are you going to go out with him, Jeffrey?

16:03.346 --> 16:04.887
Mm, I don't think so.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.998
Honestly, I'm just not interested.

16:08.033 --> 16:11.467
Although there is this rumor,
Jeffrey started it that,

16:11.467 --> 16:16.340
physically, a relationship
with him could be…

16:16.375 --> 16:17.861
quite rewarding.

16:17.896 --> 16:21.529
Well, I'm sure you'll
make the right decision.

16:33.479 --> 16:35.085
Oh, hey, Brad.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.393
Um, listen, I'm, uh…

16:38.428 --> 16:42.007
I'm reluctant to ever involve myself
in the personal lives of others,

16:42.007 --> 16:43.752
unless, you know, I'm the one involved.

16:43.752 --> 16:49.384
But I, I can't help but detect that
you still harbor feelings for Denise,

16:49.419 --> 16:50.606
do you?

16:50.641 --> 16:52.808
Well, Shirley, that's a personal question.

16:52.808 --> 16:56.441
Oh, no, I know, I know that, but
the reason I ask is that I'm hearing

16:56.441 --> 17:00.568
that Jeffrey Coho has set
his little antennae on Denise.

17:00.603 --> 17:01.710
And I thought,

17:01.745 --> 17:04.453
if you were waiting for the
appropriate amount of time to pass

17:04.453 --> 17:07.040
after Daniel Post's death,

17:07.075 --> 17:10.183
just, just don't wait too long.

17:10.218 --> 17:11.617
Okay?

17:18.226 --> 17:19.446
Denny?

17:20.019 --> 17:21.674
Denny, are you…

17:23.409 --> 17:26.728
Well, I can see up is certainly down here.

17:26.762 --> 17:29.021
Denny, I'm meeting Vanessa downstairs.

17:29.021 --> 17:31.245
Will you be joining us in court today?

17:31.245 --> 17:32.000
What?

17:32.035 --> 17:34.092
I need to get to…

17:34.127 --> 17:35.063
court.

17:35.098 --> 17:37.274
They followed me home.

17:37.469 --> 17:38.687
Have a good breakfast.

17:38.687 --> 17:39.836
I'm coming, I'm coming!

17:39.836 --> 17:43.053
Vanessa, I was just on my way to meet you.

17:43.265 --> 17:44.783
I thought I'd come up.

17:44.818 --> 17:47.833
Well, as you can see, down is up.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.160
I found eight doctors willing
to testify for Donna,

17:52.160 --> 17:54.986
saying under similar conditions,
they may have done the same thing.

17:54.986 --> 17:57.453
–Really?
–I've got a motion to amend
our witness list,

17:57.453 --> 18:01.545
and we're scheduled for chambers
after this morning's session.

18:03.104 --> 18:05.564
Did she sleep in your room?

18:09.380 --> 18:11.463
You are not calling those witnesses.

18:11.463 --> 18:14.825
They go directly to the medical
decision-making of my client, sir.

18:14.825 --> 18:18.084
–If we don't have…
–Counsel, what your client did
was against the law.

18:18.084 --> 18:19.754
The fact that you found
eight other doctors

18:19.754 --> 18:21.375
who say that they, too,
would have broken the law…

18:21.375 --> 18:26.422
I'm sorry. Isn't the jury supposed
to decide if a law was broken here?

18:26.457 --> 18:28.934
We all know you plan
to argue jury nullification,

18:28.934 --> 18:30.519
which is also illegal.

18:30.554 --> 18:34.197
I will not allow you to call witnesses
in support of that unlawful endeavor.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.585
I see somebody's got his mind made up.

18:39.235 --> 18:42.913
Let me tell you something, Mr Boston,
Mr New England, Mr Out-of-towner,

18:42.913 --> 18:44.405
let me tell you something
about New Orleans.

18:44.405 --> 18:45.142
Up is down?

18:45.177 --> 18:48.535
You all think we're a city
full of victims and looters.

18:48.535 --> 18:50.843
We are neither, and as a person
who grew up here,

18:50.843 --> 18:53.081
I'm offended that the premise
of your defense is that

18:53.081 --> 18:56.822
these five victims needed to be put
out of their misery by this outlaw.

18:56.822 --> 18:58.798
–Outlaw?
–That's what you are, doctor.

18:58.798 --> 19:00.705
I sympathize with your plight that day.

19:00.705 --> 19:03.705
I will do everything I can to
ensure you get a fair trial,

19:03.705 --> 19:06.885
but what you did was outside the law.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.229
And I will not allow
other doctors to testify

19:09.229 --> 19:11.979
that they, too, would have
broken the law. It's irrelevant.

19:11.979 --> 19:14.695
But what if that were you lying
in that hospital bed that day?

19:14.695 --> 19:18.506
Then I wouldn't be here
right now, would I?

19:26.683 --> 19:29.636
Did any of the other members
complain about Clarice?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.634
No, I told you. They all loved her.

19:31.634 --> 19:33.562
And we're still happy to have Clarice,

19:33.562 --> 19:35.986
but as an all-girls gym,
we can't take Clarence,

19:35.986 --> 19:38.820
and I can't believe we're spending
1000s of dollars to have this discussion.

19:38.820 --> 19:40.281
Please just answer
the questions, Sandy.

19:40.281 --> 19:42.292
Oh, she's answering
the questions, Mr Peanut.

19:42.292 --> 19:44.233
–Clarice…
–Excuse me. What did he just…

19:44.233 --> 19:48.817
'Cause the real answer here isn't
so much in the facts but the feelings.

19:48.817 --> 19:51.401
You're emotional, child.
We can hear it in your voice.

19:51.401 --> 19:53.951
–Clarice…
–This is a fragile, emotional woman.

19:53.951 --> 19:55.281
I know it.

19:55.316 --> 19:56.531
You know I know it.

19:56.531 --> 19:59.000
–Clarice…
–'Cause I've been there.

19:59.035 --> 20:01.471
I was there when your marriage ended.

20:01.471 --> 20:03.873
Whose shoulder were you crying on, girl?

20:03.873 --> 20:05.484
–Yours.
–Damn right.

20:05.519 --> 20:07.095
So you just throw me out?

20:07.095 --> 20:10.072
What, you got your life on track,
so you just throw me out?

20:10.072 --> 20:10.907
You walked!

20:10.942 --> 20:12.153
I did not walk, ho!

20:12.153 --> 20:14.148
–I'm sitting right here!
–Clarice!

20:14.148 --> 20:15.266
You might be sitting here now,

20:15.266 --> 20:18.038
but I don't know who the hell that man is.

20:18.069 --> 20:19.307
How do you think that feels, Clarice,

20:19.307 --> 20:22.088
when your best friend just
goes poof and disappears?

20:22.088 --> 20:26.644
You just decide you want to be some guy
who's so shy he doesn't even speak?

20:26.644 --> 20:29.360
You quit this friendship, not me.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.676
You quit this friendship.

20:35.931 --> 20:39.666
I last spoke to my husband
the morning before Katrina hit.

20:39.666 --> 20:41.486
And he was in the defendant's hospital?

20:41.486 --> 20:42.241
Yes.

20:42.276 --> 20:46.453
He had undergone a procedure
to amputate both his legs.

20:46.488 --> 20:50.631
He had advanced diabetes, and
well, he was very overweight.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.024
And what did you two
talk about on the phone?

20:53.024 --> 20:58.442
Oh, he was barking orders about
how I should get ready for the storm.

20:58.477 --> 20:59.734
If you can imagine it,

20:59.734 --> 21:02.746
here the man has had both his legs cut off,

21:02.781 --> 21:05.758
and he's telling me how
to fight a hurricane.

21:06.480 --> 21:09.263
But that was Elliot.

21:09.298 --> 21:10.757
A fighter.

21:10.792 --> 21:15.517
And when was the next time you
heard from Elliot, Mrs Babineaux?

21:16.272 --> 21:19.342
I never heard from him again.

21:19.809 --> 21:25.037
I lost contact after the storm hit,
and I couldn't get to the hospital.

21:25.865 --> 21:29.917
Ten days later, I found out he was dead.

21:31.162 --> 21:33.969
And did you learn how he died, ma'am?

21:34.004 --> 21:35.721
No.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.599
No, that was three weeks later

21:39.634 --> 21:43.050
when the police detective
told me what she did.

21:43.085 --> 21:44.433
Mrs Babineaux,

21:44.468 --> 21:47.564
the defendant claims that
under the circumstances…

21:47.564 --> 21:50.626
My husband survived Vietnam
and prostate cancer.

21:50.626 --> 21:52.713
He'd have battled this, too.

21:52.748 --> 21:54.800
He never would have given up,

21:55.444 --> 21:59.661
but she decided he didn't
even deserve the chance.

22:00.178 --> 22:01.962
Ma'am, if you had been there,

22:01.962 --> 22:03.676
and the doctors convinced you

22:03.676 --> 22:06.103
that, in fact, your husband would
die over the next two days…

22:06.103 --> 22:08.007
She couldn't convince me of anything.

22:08.007 --> 22:09.877
She wasn't even my husband's doctor.

22:09.877 --> 22:11.799
But suppose you were convinced,

22:11.799 --> 22:14.511
and the choice was between
two days of suffering

22:14.511 --> 22:17.766
versus a more humane end to the pain,

22:17.801 --> 22:20.501
which would you choose?

22:21.701 --> 22:24.698
Of course, I would choose the latter,

22:24.733 --> 22:27.695
but I don't accept your hypothetical.

22:27.730 --> 22:28.911
I told you,

22:28.946 --> 22:31.337
my husband was a survivor,
and it wasn't her call.

22:31.337 --> 22:34.192
She had never even met my husband.

22:34.227 --> 22:38.421
Where was your husband's
treating physician? Do you know?

22:40.208 --> 22:42.053
He'd left.

22:42.088 --> 22:43.898
He got out.

22:44.246 --> 22:48.865
A lot of doctors fled, but Dr Follette…

22:50.666 --> 22:53.520
she chose to stay.

22:54.163 --> 22:56.557
I wish she hadn't.

23:19.782 --> 23:21.456
Will she consider a plea?

23:21.491 --> 23:22.730
Never.

23:22.765 --> 23:26.193
And the fact that you ask, Alan,
I don't think you really get it.

23:26.193 --> 23:28.243
Why does everybody say that?

23:28.619 --> 23:30.258
You know, I wish people,

23:30.293 --> 23:32.797
instead of watching
30 seconds of coverage,

23:32.797 --> 23:35.787
saying “isn't it awful?” and
then changing the station,

23:35.787 --> 23:39.854
I wish they'd turn their televisions
off, sit in the dark for a minute

23:39.854 --> 23:43.878
and truly try to imagine
what it must have been like.

23:47.529 --> 23:49.745
For her testimony, you can't protect her.

23:49.745 --> 23:52.255
The district attorney will come
hard. She's gotta fight back.

23:52.255 --> 23:53.626
We can't protect her.

23:53.626 --> 23:55.541
She's ready.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.473
Now let's address your closing.

23:58.508 --> 24:00.593
Are you ready?
–No.

24:00.628 --> 24:02.563
I don't know what to say, frankly.

24:02.563 --> 24:04.741
Well, you better figure that out.

24:11.589 --> 24:13.662
Why are you dressed like a nun?

24:13.697 --> 24:17.047
I was thinking about what Sandy said,

24:17.082 --> 24:18.339
and it's true.

24:18.374 --> 24:21.619
She is my best friend.

24:21.654 --> 24:23.937
I'm gonna drop the lawsuit
and go back to the club.

24:23.937 --> 24:26.644
But many of those girls like
girls. Know what I'm saying?

24:26.644 --> 24:29.261
They probably like me in that girlie way.

24:29.261 --> 24:32.716
I gotta send a message I'm there
platonic, all celibate-like.

24:32.716 --> 24:34.944
That way no signals get mixed.

24:34.979 --> 24:35.948
I see.

24:35.983 --> 24:39.485
Were signals getting mixed
before with Sandy?

24:39.520 --> 24:41.694
Sandy's heterosexual.

24:41.729 --> 24:43.140
She likes men.

24:43.175 --> 24:45.948
She even liked her deadbeat
bony-assed husband

24:45.948 --> 24:47.459
till she smartened up.

24:47.494 --> 24:50.188
It's all platonic between me and Sandy.

24:50.223 --> 24:52.354
And if that's all it is, then…

24:52.389 --> 24:53.586
–Then what?
–Well.

24:53.621 --> 24:56.158
Are you interested in Sandy?

24:56.664 --> 24:58.136
Take off the habit, Clarice.

24:58.136 --> 25:00.724
This here's a contract
between me and God, bitch.

25:00.724 --> 25:03.639
Yeah, take off the habit!

25:10.468 --> 25:15.036
Clarence, do you have
feelings for Sandy?

25:16.071 --> 25:17.272
Look…

25:17.307 --> 25:19.690
you have nobody else to talk to, okay?

25:19.690 --> 25:22.200
You might as well fill me in.

25:22.752 --> 25:26.137
I tried to be me with her.

25:26.172 --> 25:28.269
She didn't want that.

25:28.522 --> 25:31.196
She just wants to be with Clarice.

25:31.231 --> 25:34.949
All Clarice is is Clarence.

25:34.984 --> 25:36.497
Not the alter ego,

25:36.532 --> 25:40.875
but the ego that's just
too shy to come out.

25:41.481 --> 25:44.420
I think she would like Clarence,

25:44.455 --> 25:47.350
and I think you should ask her out.

25:47.385 --> 25:50.246
Oh, no, no. I, I could never do that.

25:50.281 --> 25:51.408
Yes, you can.

25:51.443 --> 25:53.013
That's where you were headed.

25:53.013 --> 25:55.723
That's the reason you went
back to that club as Clarence,

25:55.723 --> 25:58.259
so Sandy could meet you,

25:58.294 --> 26:02.702
and maybe you two could go out.

26:03.154 --> 26:06.593
Don't lie to me in
a nun suit, Clarence.

26:08.431 --> 26:11.284
I gave them the injections
to relieve their suffering.

26:11.284 --> 26:14.102
Did I know that it could
possibly hasten their death?

26:14.102 --> 26:16.395
Yes, but they were gonna die anyway.

26:16.395 --> 26:18.653
Do you make room for the possibility

26:18.653 --> 26:21.543
that any of those five patients
could have survived?

26:21.543 --> 26:24.493
Well, I suppose anything's
possible, but the reality was,

26:24.493 --> 26:27.714
they were looking at dehydration,
sepsis, toxic shock.

26:27.714 --> 26:30.901
They were gonna die in almost
unimaginably painful ways.

26:30.901 --> 26:33.572
I just couldn't let that happen.

26:34.736 --> 26:37.105
Can you tell us what
those days were like?

26:37.105 --> 26:39.294
Well, we had no electricity.

26:39.329 --> 26:40.805
By Tuesday, when the levees broke,

26:40.805 --> 26:42.943
the water started to pour into the hospital.

26:42.943 --> 26:45.073
We were without generator power by then.

26:45.073 --> 26:46.401
And the heat,

26:46.436 --> 26:48.315
it was probably 110°.

26:48.350 --> 26:50.195
We had no drinking water.

26:50.230 --> 26:53.115
The hospital was like a
death camp. It smelled like it.

26:53.115 --> 26:55.940
Human waste, decomposing bodies.

26:55.975 --> 26:58.368
And the patients…

27:00.582 --> 27:02.006
they knew.

27:02.041 --> 27:04.124
They knew they were dying.

27:04.159 --> 27:06.172
And they were in agony.

27:06.207 --> 27:09.034
And there was nothing we could do.

27:09.576 --> 27:11.941
And what was the lowest point?

27:11.976 --> 27:15.374
The lowest point was when we
realized nobody was coming.

27:15.374 --> 27:18.702
We were clinging to the idea
that help was on its way,

27:18.702 --> 27:22.411
but we heard on the radio, which
was our only source of information,

27:22.411 --> 27:25.136
we heard that nobody was coming.

27:25.171 --> 27:27.724
So those people who could get out,

27:27.759 --> 27:30.242
including medical personnel, did.

27:30.277 --> 27:35.561
The rest of us stayed to at least try
to make the patients comfortable.

27:35.596 --> 27:37.917
These five patients, were they coherent?

27:37.917 --> 27:39.596
Two were, three weren't.

27:39.631 --> 27:43.888
And did you get consent
before hastening their deaths?

27:43.923 --> 27:45.470
They consented to being medicated.

27:45.470 --> 27:46.943
In fact, they were begging for it.

27:46.943 --> 27:48.346
But did they consent to dying?

27:48.346 --> 27:50.402
They were dying no matter what,
Mr Mersel.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.900
So you decided to speed it up
without telling them?

27:52.900 --> 27:55.055
Many doctors would have
done exactly as I did.

27:55.055 --> 27:56.653
Many also condemn what you did.

27:56.653 --> 27:57.964
None that were there.

27:57.964 --> 28:00.894
You hear Ms Georgina Babineaux
talk about her husband's will to live?

28:00.894 --> 28:02.515
He was 320 pounds.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.956
There was no one to lift him,
even if we could get him out.

28:04.956 --> 28:06.368
So you decided to play God.

28:06.368 --> 28:07.745
I decided to play doctor.

28:07.745 --> 28:08.789
By ending his life.

28:08.789 --> 28:10.282
By ending his suffering!

28:10.282 --> 28:13.935
All right, I think both sides
have made their points.

28:25.722 --> 28:27.887
Jeffrey Coho, how are you?

28:27.922 --> 28:29.038
–Well…
–I'm not interested.

28:29.038 --> 28:31.105
So you're asking Denise Bauer
out, I hear.

28:31.105 --> 28:33.103
–Where did you hear that?
–From Denise.

28:33.103 --> 28:35.138
The last time I checked,
you were asking me out.

28:35.138 --> 28:36.759
Yeah, and you stiffed me.

28:36.759 --> 28:38.354
I was kidnapped.

28:38.389 --> 28:40.400
Don't tell me you take that personally.

28:40.400 --> 28:45.153
Shirley, it took a lot of courage for me
to put myself out there like that.

28:45.153 --> 28:46.925
Now I get enough rejection around here

28:46.925 --> 28:48.986
without signing up for more.

28:49.021 --> 28:51.049
I was kidnapped.

28:51.084 --> 28:53.625
So let's reschedule Denise?

28:53.660 --> 28:55.096
Dinner?

28:55.131 --> 28:58.223
Denise, listen, I, uh…

28:58.704 --> 29:01.451
Well, I'm just gonna say it, okay.

29:02.237 --> 29:05.430
I would like to start seeing you.

29:07.458 --> 29:10.689
I mean, I never stopped.
I know you know…

29:10.724 --> 29:12.635
I just don't date engaged women.

29:12.635 --> 29:14.674
But now that you're
not engaged anymore,

29:14.674 --> 29:16.679
and you and I were very
compatible together…

29:16.679 --> 29:19.201
Brad, um, I'm not gonna date any man

29:19.236 --> 29:23.204
unless I think there's a chance
for a serious relationship.

29:23.239 --> 29:26.379
And you see no such chance with me?

29:26.414 --> 29:28.018
None.

29:30.247 --> 29:32.573
Could I ask why?

29:33.209 --> 29:35.479
Our values. Our politics.

29:35.514 --> 29:41.520
Look, when we did actually go
out to dinner, it's not like the
conversation exactly flowed.

29:46.526 --> 29:51.050
Maybe we should just be the other then.

29:51.691 --> 29:54.046
Friends with benefits?

29:59.113 --> 30:01.303
Only if nobody finds out.

30:01.338 --> 30:03.493
If anybody does, it's over.

30:22.214 --> 30:24.009
What are you doing?

30:24.044 --> 30:25.804
We should be in court.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.219
Or with hookers.

30:28.438 --> 30:32.068
I'm just trying to imagine
what it must have been like.

30:32.099 --> 30:35.066
In that hospital, in this city.

30:35.101 --> 30:38.666
Think of it, Denny. Water
pouring down the streets.

30:38.701 --> 30:40.958
I bet the fishing was good.

30:40.993 --> 30:43.234
The truth is, I can't imagine it,
not really.

30:43.234 --> 30:45.440
Of course you can't.
That's the whole point.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.982
You keep trying to apply norms here.

30:48.017 --> 30:52.571
You think you should be able to
relate or get other people to relate.

30:53.968 --> 30:57.520
What happened here was
off the radar, man.

30:58.665 --> 31:02.258
Yours, mine.

31:04.646 --> 31:06.538
Denny, I think you're absolutely right.

31:06.538 --> 31:08.416
Of course I'm right.

31:11.180 --> 31:13.693
Let's go get the hookers.

31:27.790 --> 31:29.933
This isn't a complicated case.

31:29.968 --> 31:34.777
The defendant lethally injected five people,

31:34.812 --> 31:36.580
causing their deaths.

31:36.615 --> 31:38.512
Might they have died anyway?

31:38.547 --> 31:39.971
Maybe.

31:40.006 --> 31:41.361
So what?

31:41.396 --> 31:44.447
That doesn't give this doctor
the right to take the law,

31:44.447 --> 31:47.624
and more importantly,
their lives into her hands.

31:47.624 --> 31:51.094
Physician-assisted suicide
isn't even lawful in this state.

31:51.094 --> 31:55.073
To kill a patient without his consent,

31:55.290 --> 31:59.579
do I really need to stand here
and argue the illegality of that?

31:59.614 --> 32:03.868
And even should you be inclined
to engage in the moral debate

32:03.903 --> 32:05.895
defense counsel would like you to,

32:05.895 --> 32:11.319
you have to apply the law
as it stands today.

32:11.354 --> 32:15.248
And as it stands today, when
you knowingly, intentionally

32:15.283 --> 32:19.348
cause the death of
another human being,

32:19.383 --> 32:21.237
that's murder.

32:21.272 --> 32:25.019
No matter how bad things get, this
is still the United States of America,

32:25.019 --> 32:26.796
not some third-world nation,

32:26.796 --> 32:29.459
and we don't permit people
to kill other people.

32:29.459 --> 32:32.044
If we forgive that kind of lawlessness,

32:32.079 --> 32:37.819
if we tolerate that kind of
anarchy, we cease being…

32:38.086 --> 32:41.654
the United States of America.

32:59.917 --> 33:03.485
I read an article in the New York
Times magazine not too long ago.

33:03.485 --> 33:07.386
It was about how the elephants
in Africa are going mad.

33:07.421 --> 33:09.988
Raping rhinoceroses, killing people,

33:10.023 --> 33:12.712
attacking one another,
stampeding without provocation.

33:12.712 --> 33:19.741
These intelligent, sensitive giants
have become very, very disturbed.

33:19.776 --> 33:21.325
And the cause, they believe,

33:21.325 --> 33:24.500
is overwhelming, unrelenting trauma, stress.

33:24.535 --> 33:26.369
Be it poachers shooting at them

33:26.369 --> 33:30.894
and their families or land development
squeezing and destroying their habitats,

33:30.894 --> 33:35.384
profound and irreversible changes to
everything they know about their world,

33:35.384 --> 33:38.272
everything about what it
means to be an elephant.

33:38.272 --> 33:39.671
And it's driving them mad.

33:39.671 --> 33:43.030
Elephants aren't being elephants anymore.

33:43.453 --> 33:46.747
Up is suddenly down.

33:46.782 --> 33:49.130
That's what New Orleans was like

33:49.165 --> 33:51.724
during and in the aftermath
of hurricane Katrina.

33:51.724 --> 33:54.844
Up suddenly became down. Down was up.

33:54.879 --> 33:57.297
This wasn't the United States
of America that week.

33:57.297 --> 34:00.270
It wasn't the third world.
It was utter chaos.

34:00.270 --> 34:04.395
The set of norms and logic that
we apply to everyday life were gone

34:04.395 --> 34:06.811
and everything was wrong.

34:06.846 --> 34:09.085
A friend of mine told me that
when he was finally able

34:09.085 --> 34:11.255
to get out of the city three
days after the hurricane,

34:11.255 --> 34:14.530
he drove by a body lying on the
sidewalk right up the road here,

34:14.530 --> 34:17.771
a body of a man partially clothed
being eaten by an alligator,

34:17.771 --> 34:19.947
and my friend wasn't shocked.
He wasn't even surprised.

34:19.947 --> 34:21.956
He was just fleeing.

34:21.991 --> 34:26.190
This was not the United States of America,
nor any place else for that matter.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.580
During that horrendous week,

34:27.580 --> 34:31.272
the United States of America
was nowhere to be found.

34:31.306 --> 34:36.116
My client, Dr Follette, was to be found.

34:37.085 --> 34:39.268
She was there.

34:39.303 --> 34:41.451
When the storm hit

34:41.485 --> 34:45.574
and when the devastating effects
started to become clear

34:45.609 --> 34:50.646
and then dire and then desperate,

34:50.681 --> 34:52.803
she stayed.

34:53.161 --> 34:56.047
Even when so many others
around her were leaving,

34:56.047 --> 34:59.367
she stayed with those five patients,

34:59.402 --> 35:02.854
each facing an inevitable,
imminent and excruciating death

35:02.854 --> 35:06.085
surrounded by pain and
suffering and degradation

35:06.120 --> 35:09.317
unfathomable to those of us
who were not there.

35:09.352 --> 35:12.751
She stayed and helped
and cared and watched

35:12.786 --> 35:19.281
as those five patients slipped
quietly into the good night.

35:19.624 --> 35:25.389
In a setting that was punishing,

35:25.424 --> 35:29.769
cruel and unusual,

35:29.804 --> 35:33.782
her actions were humane.

35:39.402 --> 35:42.962
Like those elephants in Africa,

35:42.997 --> 35:49.162
so many people, during that terrible
time of chaos and desperation,

35:49.197 --> 35:52.098
seemed to lose…

35:52.980 --> 35:54.747
themselves,

35:54.782 --> 36:01.625
seemed to lose their
innate sense of humanity.

36:03.914 --> 36:07.413
Dr Follette never did.

36:09.544 --> 36:11.837
She never did.

36:34.651 --> 36:38.315
So you're dropping the
lawsuit just like that?

36:38.350 --> 36:39.696
Yes.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.043
No.

36:41.448 --> 36:43.327
On one condition.

36:43.362 --> 36:44.974
That, uh…

36:45.009 --> 36:46.877
You…

36:47.075 --> 36:51.217
You have dinner with me.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.667
Why?

36:55.430 --> 36:57.508
Because…

36:57.543 --> 37:02.707
Because I would like to ask you…

37:02.742 --> 37:04.688
Out.

37:06.719 --> 37:11.122
“Out” like on a date?

37:13.556 --> 37:16.768
Clarice is me.

37:24.426 --> 37:26.361
Clarence.

37:28.803 --> 37:31.725
I'd love to have dinner with you.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.482
Really?

37:33.763 --> 37:35.439
Really.

37:41.261 --> 37:43.387
Denise, tonight,
10 o'clock, my place?

37:43.387 --> 37:44.760
You're on.

37:46.402 --> 37:47.262
Denise.

37:47.297 --> 37:48.660
Jeffrey, I've been thinking,

37:48.660 --> 37:50.665
I don't want to have
a relationship with you.

37:50.665 --> 37:53.272
You're just not what I'm
looking for in a partner.

37:53.272 --> 37:57.884
But do you know what the term
“friends with benefits” means?

37:57.919 --> 37:59.371
You slut.

37:59.406 --> 38:01.638
One condition, nobody finds out.

38:01.673 --> 38:04.735
If anybody does, it's over.

38:15.517 --> 38:19.168
Shirley, what is this
“friends with benefits”?

38:19.203 --> 38:20.721
Have you heard of that?

38:20.749 --> 38:24.754
It's basically an arrangement
for casual sex. Why?

38:24.789 --> 38:30.896
I, uh, just overheard Denise and Jeffrey
Coho making such an arrangement.

38:30.931 --> 38:32.122
Really?

38:32.157 --> 38:33.793
Should we intervene?

38:33.828 --> 38:37.224
He's a partner. She's an associate.

38:37.997 --> 38:40.637
They're both also two consenting adults.

38:40.656 --> 38:42.803
We stay clear.

38:45.289 --> 38:48.492
“Friends with benefits.”

38:48.527 --> 38:50.934
I can't keep up.

38:54.729 --> 38:59.216
Would you ever make
such an arrangement?

38:59.251 --> 39:01.050
No!

39:01.085 --> 39:03.401
Would you?

39:03.605 --> 39:05.471
Of course not.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.384
Thank you.

39:21.481 --> 39:23.891
For believing what you said.

39:23.926 --> 39:27.914
Let's just hope it's what the 12
people in the jury room believe.

39:27.914 --> 39:29.269
Can I ask you a question?

39:29.269 --> 39:31.381
I want you to be honest with me.

39:31.415 --> 39:32.986
Okay.

39:33.021 --> 39:36.698
Can you and I get naked
in a jacuzzi tonight?

39:37.903 --> 39:41.376
When Shirley made the offer,
it came with two disclaimers,

39:41.376 --> 39:43.014
you and you.

39:43.049 --> 39:44.652
What offer?

39:44.687 --> 39:48.103
She invited me to join Crane,
Poole & Schmidt Boston.

39:48.103 --> 39:49.326
And you accepted?

39:49.361 --> 39:51.039
Mm, I could still change my mind.

39:51.039 --> 39:53.359
It was my idea, that offer.

39:53.394 --> 39:55.679
I'm a big fan of diversity.

39:55.714 --> 39:58.017
I date midgets, you know? Ask him.

39:58.052 --> 40:00.086
And their mothers.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.427
Jury's back.

40:11.002 --> 40:13.195
Mr Foreman, have you reached a verdict?

40:13.195 --> 40:14.280
We have, your honor.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.834
What say you?

40:17.108 --> 40:19.825
“In the case of Orleans parish vs Follette”

40:19.825 --> 40:22.508
“on the charges of murder
in the first degree”

40:22.508 --> 40:25.386
“we find the defendant Donna Follette”

40:25.421 --> 40:27.410
“not guilty.”

40:27.858 --> 40:30.320
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
thank you for your service.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.974
You're dismissed, and
this court is adjourned.

40:34.561 --> 40:35.815
I don't believe it.

40:35.830 --> 40:37.420
Neither do I.

40:38.022 --> 40:39.511
Thank you.

40:40.758 --> 40:42.354
Still undefeated.

40:48.836 --> 40:50.479
You won the day, Denny.

40:50.514 --> 40:51.802
Up is down.

40:51.837 --> 40:53.056
You won it.

40:53.091 --> 40:55.599
And you didn't want
to bring me along.

40:55.624 --> 41:00.074
Using the hooker in the “up is down”
demonstrative was a deft touch.

41:00.074 --> 41:02.252
It's all in the details.

41:03.685 --> 41:06.321
I tried closing my eyes again.

41:06.544 --> 41:08.297
To imagine.

41:08.332 --> 41:10.051
I couldn't.

41:10.424 --> 41:13.488
Nobody could, I suppose,
unless they were there.

41:13.488 --> 41:15.248
I was there.

41:15.946 --> 41:19.392
Well, I flew over it
in my Gulfstream.

41:19.427 --> 41:20.818
Doesn't that count?

41:20.853 --> 41:22.548
To some.

41:24.564 --> 41:26.407
Can we talk about something else?

41:26.407 --> 41:27.882
What?

41:28.304 --> 41:30.157
Vanessa.

41:30.418 --> 41:31.830
Oh, she's nasty,

41:31.865 --> 41:36.031
in a prudy, puritanical, judgmental way.

41:36.066 --> 41:39.169
On a scale of one to ten,
what do you give my chances?

41:39.169 --> 41:41.020
A minus-two.

41:42.241 --> 41:46.782
Denny Crane! Loves a challenge!

41:48.073 --> 41:50.240
May old acquaintances be forgot.

41:50.275 --> 41:53.107
And replaced with new ones.

41:54.356 --> 41:56.338
Happy new year, my friend.

41:56.373 --> 41:58.286
Looking up.

41:58.321 --> 42:01.161
It's gonna be the best one you'll have.
