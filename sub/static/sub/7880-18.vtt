_

00:08.449 --> 00:09.983
You're a real alien?

00:10.017 --> 00:11.084
And now that you know,

00:11.118 --> 00:12.818
I have to kill
either you or Roger.

00:12.853 --> 00:14.487
Wait, no one has to die.

00:14.522 --> 00:16.923
I'll just go back
to my home planet.

00:21.239 --> 00:23.382
Jeff, come here, honey.

00:24.765 --> 00:26.432
Aah! No! Hayley!

00:26.467 --> 00:27.917
Jeff!

00:27.935 --> 00:30.453
No!

00:31.102 --> 00:32.871
_

00:36.860 --> 00:38.778
Are you up there, Jeff?

00:38.812 --> 00:41.314
Are you even still alive?

01:05.789 --> 01:07.757
MALE:
Mr. Fischer?

01:07.791 --> 01:09.375
Where am I?

01:09.410 --> 01:10.960
Where?

01:12.146 --> 01:13.462
On the floor.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.647
(laughter)

01:14.682 --> 01:16.566
I'm not supposed to be
on this spaceship.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.184
I need to get back to my wife!

01:18.218 --> 01:20.887
God, talk much about yourself?

01:20.921 --> 01:22.905
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.190
Yeah, well you should be.

01:24.224 --> 01:26.576
Anyway, hi, I'm Foster,

01:26.610 --> 01:29.112
head of the Emperor's
Elite Guard.

01:29.146 --> 01:31.814
Come on, let's have a
look-see around the ship.

01:31.832 --> 01:34.517
Welcome to Slave City.

01:34.551 --> 01:36.619
This is where we keep
all of the prisoners

01:36.653 --> 01:39.756
we've abducted from
across the galaxy.

01:54.888 --> 01:57.140
But you're gonna take me
back to Earth, right?

01:57.174 --> 02:00.226
Yeah, this isn't that
kind of slave ship, Jeff.

02:00.277 --> 02:02.362
Where you get to
do things you want.

02:03.530 --> 02:06.516
(blowing haunting tune)

02:06.550 --> 02:08.533
(sobbing)

02:12.790 --> 02:14.624
Hey, don't look so glum.

02:14.658 --> 02:16.459
All the slaves serve

02:16.493 --> 02:19.078
a very important
purpose on this ship.

02:19.129 --> 02:20.630
In the upper levels,

02:20.664 --> 02:24.751
where you'll work to
serve our every desire.

02:29.623 --> 02:31.207
Hey,

02:31.225 --> 02:33.209
another human.

02:33.227 --> 02:34.927
Suck you clean for a dollar.

02:34.978 --> 02:36.879
(screams)

02:45.839 --> 02:48.057
(gentle music plays)

02:48.092 --> 02:50.093
(kissing noise)

02:51.829 --> 02:53.196
(bell dings)

02:57.167 --> 02:58.785
So this ship

02:58.836 --> 03:01.754
is just one big shopping mall?

03:01.789 --> 03:03.156
Exactly.

03:12.149 --> 03:15.651
You see, every time Emperor
Zing visits a new planet,

03:15.686 --> 03:17.687
he picks his favorite
shop or restaurant

03:17.721 --> 03:19.555
then replicates it here.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.007
Want to guess what he considers

03:21.041 --> 03:22.625
to be Earth's greatest
contribution?

03:22.659 --> 03:24.727
Because that's where
you'll be working.

03:24.762 --> 03:26.279
Falafel?

03:26.313 --> 03:28.264
Close, shawarmas.

03:28.298 --> 03:29.499
How weird is that?

03:29.533 --> 03:31.150
He was like so close.

03:32.536 --> 03:34.971
Look, you got to make sure
you leave enough room

03:35.005 --> 03:37.607
for cucumbers <i>and</i> tahini, okay?

03:37.641 --> 03:39.542
Are you listening to me?

03:39.576 --> 03:41.244
I'm sorry, it's just that...

03:41.278 --> 03:43.346
Well, you're Sinbad.

03:43.380 --> 03:45.381
Yeah, I know, so what?

03:45.416 --> 03:48.418
Wow, so this is where you've
been for the last 15 years.

03:48.452 --> 03:49.585
What?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.788
I just got here two months ago.

03:51.822 --> 03:53.222
Oh, sorry.

03:53.257 --> 03:55.408
He's on a spree, he's on
a spree, he's on a spree,

03:55.442 --> 03:57.577
he's on a spree, he's on a
spree, he's on a spree...

03:57.611 --> 03:59.645
Oh, no, no, no, man,
Emperor's on a shopping spree.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.264
Quick, quick, quick, look busy!

04:01.298 --> 04:03.516
Don't look him in the eye.

04:03.567 --> 04:04.934
Three shawarmas, Earthlings,

04:04.968 --> 04:07.136
and don't skimp on the tahini.

04:07.154 --> 04:09.155
This is my treat today, guys.

04:09.189 --> 04:10.473
Seriously,
put your wallets away.

04:10.491 --> 04:11.657
You're gonna love this.

04:11.692 --> 04:13.793
Emperor, please,
let me go home.

04:13.827 --> 04:15.228
I miss my wife.

04:15.262 --> 04:16.562
I love her so much.

04:16.596 --> 04:18.231
Love? Ha!

04:18.265 --> 04:19.866
There's no such thing as love.

04:19.916 --> 04:22.835
It's just a pathetic notion
that you lesser life forms

04:22.870 --> 04:25.488
cling to so you don't feel
so alone.

04:25.506 --> 04:26.672
That's not true.

04:26.707 --> 04:28.808
The love I have
for Hayley is real!

04:28.842 --> 04:30.059
(buzzing, screams)

04:30.093 --> 04:32.228
Do not challenge your emperor.

04:32.262 --> 04:34.330
Or put so much ice
in the drinks.

04:34.364 --> 04:35.965
It already comes out cold.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.867
You're just ripping people off.

04:37.901 --> 04:40.186
Come on, gals.

04:42.105 --> 04:45.041
Oh, man, I'm never going home.

04:45.075 --> 04:47.009
Oh, man, you know, you
probably feel like I did

04:47.044 --> 04:49.028
when I found out they weren't
gonna do <i>Houseguest 2.</i>

04:49.062 --> 04:50.396
It's rough in the
beginning, man.

04:50.430 --> 04:51.998
But you know what,
it gets worse, yeah.

04:52.032 --> 04:54.417
And then you got to live
in your car for a while.

04:54.451 --> 04:55.585
And that's a trip.

04:55.619 --> 04:57.186
And you got to get
used to living outside,

04:57.204 --> 04:58.671
then you got homeless
folks punching your face.

04:58.705 --> 05:00.173
You know, you know,

05:00.207 --> 05:02.243
I might not be the right
guy to help you here, man.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.441
♪

05:21.578 --> 05:23.179
On the house.

05:23.213 --> 05:24.597
Thanks, lady.

05:24.648 --> 05:26.315
That ain't no lady, brother.

05:26.350 --> 05:28.017
Look, she's not even human.

05:28.051 --> 05:29.718
She's a shape-shifter.

05:31.488 --> 05:32.889
She's super horny.

05:32.923 --> 05:34.607
She's hornier than
Kadeem Hardison.

05:34.658 --> 05:37.643
I'm talking when his glasses
were flipped up.

05:40.147 --> 05:42.765
I get off a little later,
if you want to...

05:42.799 --> 05:45.751
get off with me.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.206
No thanks, I'm married.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.791
Did you say you were married?!

05:51.842 --> 05:53.459
Leave us alone, Phil.

05:53.493 --> 05:55.228
Okay, but would you say
you're in love?

05:55.262 --> 05:56.629
Oh, yeah, big time.

05:56.663 --> 05:58.130
Go on, man, get out of here.

05:58.165 --> 05:59.498
What did I say
about boundaries, Phil?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.000
But the kid says he's in love.

06:01.034 --> 06:03.085
He should exercise his right
and take the test.

06:03.103 --> 06:04.537
I told you step off!

06:04.571 --> 06:05.771
My contact!

06:05.806 --> 06:07.540
Well, wait a minute, what test?

06:07.574 --> 06:08.841
Yo, don't worry about it, man.

06:08.876 --> 06:10.710
Just forget it.
Sinbad...

06:13.447 --> 06:16.716
Look, if you can prove that
when the aliens abducted you,

06:16.750 --> 06:18.818
they separated you
from your true love,

06:18.852 --> 06:21.220
well, then they have to
take you back to Earth.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.556
That's great,
'cause I am in love.

06:23.590 --> 06:26.409
Well, a lot of us thought
we were in love, too.

06:26.443 --> 06:28.511
And when you fail
the emperor's test,

06:28.545 --> 06:30.112
they do this.

06:30.147 --> 06:31.430
(gasps)
Uh-huh.

06:31.465 --> 06:32.865
They make you smooth.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.467
And I'm not alone.

06:34.501 --> 06:36.385
We all lost.

06:37.588 --> 06:40.106
Some of us lost less
than others.

06:40.140 --> 06:43.709
You guys just never saw it
from the right angle.

06:43.744 --> 06:46.112
But the love Hayley
and I have is real.

06:46.146 --> 06:47.847
I know it is.

06:47.881 --> 06:49.081
I'm going for it.

06:49.116 --> 06:50.299
I'm taking the test.

06:50.334 --> 06:52.818
(cheering)

06:52.853 --> 06:54.220
Um, I ordered a beer.

06:54.254 --> 06:56.188
I think this is a cider?

07:03.855 --> 07:05.122
Jeff, I'm begging you, man.

07:05.156 --> 07:06.465
Please, man,
don't go out there.

07:06.598 --> 07:09.133
Look, no one has ever passed
the test of true love.

07:09.168 --> 07:11.586
The emperor has a fish tank
filled with our junk.

07:11.620 --> 07:13.821
That thing is just swimming
with junk.

07:13.856 --> 07:16.257
Listen, Sinbad, I love my wife.

07:20.262 --> 07:23.931
I'm gonna go prove it,
and then I'm gonna go home.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.335
(cheering)

07:34.643 --> 07:37.979
(applause)

07:38.013 --> 07:40.114
Jeff Fischer,

07:40.148 --> 07:44.118
you insist you have a right
to be returned safely to Earth.

07:44.152 --> 07:48.355
On what grounds do you base
this preposterous notion?

07:48.373 --> 07:51.959
Um, on the grounds
that when you guys abducted me,

07:51.994 --> 07:54.028
you separated me from true love.

07:54.046 --> 07:58.316
Are you willing to take
the test to prove it?

07:58.367 --> 08:00.484
I am.

08:00.536 --> 08:03.487
Well, okay then,
let's wake up...

08:03.522 --> 08:06.607
the Majestic!

08:06.625 --> 08:08.943
(cheering, whistling)

08:08.961 --> 08:10.294
W-Wait, what?

08:10.329 --> 08:12.780
Well, how do you think
this test works?

08:12.798 --> 08:14.999
I didn't know
what to think, man!

08:15.050 --> 08:19.086
Well, Jeff, our test involves
a creature called the Majestic,

08:19.120 --> 08:22.006
which delves into your memories
of alleged love

08:22.057 --> 08:24.926
and displays them
for all to see.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.845
(evil laughter)

08:30.816 --> 08:34.034
(Wax Fang's "Majestic"
begins playing)

08:35.736 --> 08:39.407
And now to help us wake up
the Majestic,

08:39.441 --> 08:40.775
The Summoner.

11:09.574 --> 11:12.326
being a selfish,
inconsiderate jerk.

No, no!

11:18.116 --> 11:19.366
I can love her better.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.451
I can. I can.

11:20.502 --> 11:22.069
Please, please,
just let me go home.

11:22.087 --> 11:24.622
I'm sorry, Jeff,
we can't do that.

11:24.673 --> 11:26.373
And you know the deal.

11:26.407 --> 11:28.242
If you can't prove the love,

11:28.260 --> 11:30.845
you lose your tools for love.

11:30.879 --> 11:33.164
(cheering)

11:33.198 --> 11:35.866
See you tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.

11:35.901 --> 11:39.419
for your smoothening,
Mr. Fischer.

11:39.438 --> 11:41.388
Oh, man,

11:41.422 --> 11:44.775
I'm so not a morning person.

11:47.779 --> 11:50.931
I thought I loved her.

11:50.966 --> 11:52.983
But those memories...

11:53.034 --> 11:54.869
they all happened.

11:54.903 --> 11:57.805
I guess I deserve
to be smoothed.

11:57.839 --> 12:01.776
Well, you still have one
night before they, you know,

12:01.810 --> 12:04.361
make the front of your
underwear roomier.

12:04.396 --> 12:07.398
And I've never been
with a human before.

12:07.432 --> 12:09.633
Sorry, I'm not really
in the mood.

12:09.668 --> 12:11.202
Oh, come on.

12:11.236 --> 12:14.472
Let's give your little
friend a going away party.

12:14.506 --> 12:18.008
I can be anyone you want.

12:19.861 --> 12:22.096
This way it's not even cheating.

12:22.130 --> 12:24.799
Whoa, you look just like her.

12:24.833 --> 12:27.935
Oh, God, I miss you so much.

12:35.977 --> 12:38.179
♪ A sight for sore eyes...

12:38.213 --> 12:41.348
Sorry, that's real
popular here.

12:41.383 --> 12:43.384
(smooth jazz playing)

12:44.553 --> 12:46.387
(moans)

12:46.421 --> 12:47.488
I-I don't know.

12:47.522 --> 12:48.656
I-I'm sorry.

12:48.690 --> 12:50.424
Your wife is a
million miles away

12:50.458 --> 12:52.459
and you still don't
want to hit this?

12:52.494 --> 12:55.262
I mean, come on,
I'm exactly like her.

12:55.297 --> 12:57.298
You look like her,
but you're not her.

12:58.733 --> 13:01.468
I mean, I didn't learn
to read for you,

13:01.503 --> 13:03.771
or stop eating
my scabs for you,

13:03.805 --> 13:06.724
or start to pee sitting down
so I wouldn't wake <i>you</i> up.

13:06.775 --> 13:10.144
You did all those
things for her?

13:10.178 --> 13:11.378
Yeah.

13:11.413 --> 13:12.746
Yeah, I did.

13:12.781 --> 13:14.582
Where were those memories?

13:14.616 --> 13:16.951
The Majestic
only showed the bad times.

13:16.985 --> 13:18.685
But why?

13:18.703 --> 13:21.155
Wait a minute, if I can just
climb down to the Majestic,

13:21.189 --> 13:22.389
I can talk to him.

13:22.424 --> 13:24.441
It's my only chance
to get some answers

13:24.476 --> 13:26.026
and maybe even
get off this ship.

13:26.061 --> 13:27.595
Jeff, that's crazy.

13:27.629 --> 13:29.597
That creature could kill you.

13:30.699 --> 13:32.499
(liquid sloshing)

13:32.534 --> 13:35.603
Hey, can you turn into
a giant pickle

13:35.637 --> 13:37.504
with girly parts?

13:37.539 --> 13:39.006
You're drunk, Toby.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.009
I'm sad, you (bleep) bitch.

13:42.043 --> 13:44.595
(sobbing)

13:49.234 --> 13:51.418
This is a bad idea, man.

13:51.453 --> 13:53.587
Who knows what that
thing'll do to you?

13:53.622 --> 13:55.139
Well, I'm about to find out.

13:55.173 --> 13:56.307
Jeff, wait.

13:56.341 --> 13:57.691
I'm done waiting.

13:57.725 --> 13:59.577
But I didn't tie this off.

13:59.611 --> 14:03.097
(screaming)

14:03.131 --> 14:04.999
The key is to roll
when you land!

14:05.033 --> 14:06.734
I know what I'm talking about!

14:06.768 --> 14:09.536
I did my own stunts
in <i>Good Burger!</i>

14:15.650 --> 14:17.567
(screaming)

14:17.601 --> 14:19.586
(grunts)

14:22.023 --> 14:24.474
I wasn't expecting visitors.

14:24.509 --> 14:26.860
You're the Majestic.

14:26.894 --> 14:28.996
(screams)

14:29.030 --> 14:30.597
The ship's sewage.

14:30.632 --> 14:32.082
Gross to you maybe,

14:32.116 --> 14:35.919
but full of nutrients that I
simply cannot live without.

14:35.953 --> 14:37.204
(slurping)

14:37.238 --> 14:38.839
My memories--

14:38.890 --> 14:40.707
you only showed the bad ones.

14:40.742 --> 14:42.259
Do you hate me?

14:42.293 --> 14:43.894
You must hate me.

14:43.928 --> 14:46.079
Emperor Zing said he'd
blow me into space

14:46.114 --> 14:47.614
if I showed the good ones.

14:47.649 --> 14:50.917
Oh, what you must think of me!

14:50.952 --> 14:54.488
(sobbing)

14:54.522 --> 14:56.156
It's okay.

14:56.190 --> 14:57.841
I know what the emperor
can be like,

14:57.875 --> 14:58.992
and I forgive you.

14:59.027 --> 15:01.728
He wasn't such a bad guy,

15:01.763 --> 15:03.747
you know... before.

15:03.781 --> 15:04.915
Before?

15:04.949 --> 15:07.884
Why, before the heartbreak.

15:07.919 --> 15:09.886
Emperor Zing was in love?

15:09.921 --> 15:11.521
Oh, yes.

15:11.556 --> 15:13.807
Thought he'd met "the one,"

15:13.858 --> 15:16.259
but then he got dumped,

15:16.277 --> 15:19.062
and it devastated him
so completely

15:19.096 --> 15:21.931
he vowed to never love again.

15:21.949 --> 15:24.434
But the pain still remained,

15:24.452 --> 15:26.286
so he started shopping.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.155
Compulsively.

15:28.206 --> 15:29.990
That's why this ship's a mall.

15:30.024 --> 15:32.125
That's exactly right, Jeff.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.529
And when buying stuff
didn't cure what ailed him,

15:35.563 --> 15:38.248
he decided to wage a war

15:38.282 --> 15:40.434
against love.

15:40.468 --> 15:45.172
And that's why he won't let
me show any good memories.

15:45.206 --> 15:47.908
Majestic, we've got
to let everyone know.

15:47.959 --> 15:51.128
Once they realize the truth,
it's sure to spark a rebellion.

15:51.162 --> 15:54.464
Oh, my God, we're
really gonna do it.

15:54.499 --> 15:57.000
What a quick turn for
me, but I love it.

15:57.034 --> 15:58.101
Great!

15:58.136 --> 16:00.003
Oh, hey, but first,
do you have a bathroom?

16:00.037 --> 16:01.905
I got to go number two.

16:02.907 --> 16:04.141
Oh, sorry.

16:04.175 --> 16:05.776
Too crass?

16:08.813 --> 16:10.814
(cheering)

16:21.676 --> 16:23.527
Oh, thank you.

16:23.561 --> 16:25.662
Those boxers were not clean.

16:25.696 --> 16:27.230
(gasps):
The shape-shifter!

16:27.265 --> 16:28.315
(grunts)

16:28.349 --> 16:30.267
(screaming)

16:30.301 --> 16:32.285
(grunts)

16:32.320 --> 16:34.387
Hwah!

16:34.422 --> 16:37.057
Guards, find Jeff Fischer.

16:37.108 --> 16:38.291
I'm right here, dude.

16:39.660 --> 16:40.961
(gasping)

16:40.995 --> 16:43.897
The emperor's been lying
to you all!

16:43.931 --> 16:46.133
True love does exist.

16:46.167 --> 16:47.501
He's just been hiding it.

16:47.535 --> 16:48.935
Show them, Maj!

16:51.305 --> 16:52.939
♪

17:25.506 --> 17:27.073
He's getting away.

17:27.108 --> 17:28.492
Kill him!

17:35.366 --> 17:37.133
There's the escape pod.

17:41.305 --> 17:44.191
Oh, looks like we got
some customers, Jeff.

17:44.225 --> 17:45.592
You boys come
for some shawarma?

17:45.626 --> 17:46.860
Come on, get it.

There is love in the world.

'Cause you had it!

18:04.595 --> 18:06.062
(screaming)

18:11.869 --> 18:14.304
You know, I was thinking
this weekend

18:14.338 --> 18:16.206
we could go out
with Derek and Tommy.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.374
What do you think?

18:17.408 --> 18:18.875
Honey?

18:18.910 --> 18:21.778
Hello?

18:23.247 --> 18:25.448
(moaning)

18:25.483 --> 18:26.716
Roger?

18:26.751 --> 18:28.385
Oh, my God, okay, wow.

18:28.419 --> 18:30.520
Can we please be grown-ups
about this?

18:30.555 --> 18:33.056
Because I can't.

18:33.090 --> 18:35.692
(sobbing)

18:35.726 --> 18:38.495
You got your heart broken.

18:38.529 --> 18:41.698
That's why you told us
there's no such thing as love.

18:41.732 --> 18:44.234
You lied to us!

18:44.268 --> 18:46.269
(booing)

18:58.015 --> 18:59.849

19:18.102 --> 19:20.169
(gentle melody plays)

19:20.187 --> 19:22.439
(driving upbeat music plays)
Go on, man, get in.

19:22.473 --> 19:23.723
I'll hold them off.

19:23.758 --> 19:25.141
I'm not leaving you out here.

19:25.175 --> 19:26.526
There's too many of them, man.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.844
It's the only way.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.063
Sorry, that's just
not my style.

19:30.114 --> 19:31.481
(groans)

19:31.515 --> 19:33.350
Aah, my ear! Ow!

19:33.384 --> 19:34.918
Go on, man, get out of here.

19:34.952 --> 19:36.286
You sure? Because I think

19:36.320 --> 19:37.320
I could be a big help.

19:37.354 --> 19:38.655
(screams)

19:38.689 --> 19:40.090
Just go!

19:40.124 --> 19:41.558
And be known as the guy

19:41.592 --> 19:43.259
who left
his number one space bud?

19:43.294 --> 19:44.427
I don't think so.

19:44.462 --> 19:45.779
(yells)

19:45.813 --> 19:47.130
Please!

19:47.164 --> 19:49.633
I cannot afford to keep
paying attention to you.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.001
But...
(screams)

19:51.035 --> 19:52.919
Got it.

19:52.970 --> 19:54.654
Hurry, Sinbad!

19:54.689 --> 19:56.339
Huh? (gurgles)

19:56.374 --> 19:57.590
No!

19:59.610 --> 20:02.145
Jeff, when you get to Earth,

20:02.179 --> 20:04.214
do me this one last solid.

20:04.248 --> 20:05.682
Anything, Sinbad.

20:05.716 --> 20:08.284
Clear my...

20:08.319 --> 20:10.286
Internet browser history.

20:38.783 --> 20:40.517
I'm coming home, babe.

20:40.551 --> 20:41.801
I'm coming home.

20:41.852 --> 20:43.770
GPS VOICE:
What is your destination?

20:43.804 --> 20:46.255
Take me to Earth
so I can be with my beloved.

20:46.273 --> 20:49.559
There are
over 47,000 known earths.

20:49.593 --> 20:51.361
Oh, no.
