10:18.785 --> 10:23.916
<i>Nope, nope, nope, nope, “ODE. “ODE, “Qpem</i>

10:23.915 --> 10:26.168
No... Oh! Well, I'll be!

10:26.167 --> 10:28.670
Isn't it always on the last arm
you check? (CHUCKLES)

10:28.920 --> 10:31.799
Please, Finn and Jake,
when you return to dry land,

10:31.881 --> 10:34.134
tell no one of our lax record-keeping.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.682
Ah, don't worry, Secretary Octopus.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.682
We wouldn't want to deflate anyone's ego!

10:39.764 --> 10:42.438
(BOTH LAUGH)

10:44.936 --> 10:47.405
Huh? Ahh! Oh! (CLEARS THROAT)

10:48.022 --> 10:50.901
My kids must be worried sick!

10:52.026 --> 10:53.323
(HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING)

10:53.319 --> 10:55.572
Man, I can't understand a word you're saying.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.328
I said, where's Banana Man?

10:57.407 --> 11:00.081
We're getting low on air, and I'm freaking out.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.834
Uh, maybe there's a radio or something.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.706
" Huh?
'0h!Oh!

11:04.706 --> 11:05.958
Aargh!

11:06.082 --> 11:07.334
(LAUGHTER)

11:07.333 --> 11:09.085
You know what, bro? I'm glad you're here.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.844
JAKE: 'Cause dying together sucks
a little less than dying alone.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.345
<i>Come along with me</i>

11:19.095 --> 11:22.816
<i>And the butterflies and bees</i>

11:26.352 --> 11:28.104
This party is so crazy!
