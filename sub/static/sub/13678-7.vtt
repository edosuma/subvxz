00:01.503 --> 00:02.671
<i>What if
this all went away?</i>

00:02.754 --> 00:04.673
<i>The money. The city.
All of it.</i>

00:04.756 --> 00:06.174
The world is filled
with stupid people.

00:06.257 --> 00:08.093
<i>And I get paid a lot
to be smart.</i>

00:10.261 --> 00:13.598
<i>Susan Jacobs,
the general counsel at E Corp.</i>

00:13.723 --> 00:16.226
Madam Executioner.

00:16.559 --> 00:18.269
<i>The tracking on
her phone is working.</i>

00:18.395 --> 00:19.771
<i>How long you think
she's gonna stay away for?</i>

00:19.854 --> 00:20.772
<i>Long enough.</i>

00:20.897 --> 00:23.191
Have you ever considered
which part of our
scheme motivates you?

00:23.274 --> 00:24.776
<i>The FBI announced today,</i>

00:24.859 --> 00:28.530
<i>Tyrell Wellick
and fsociety engaged
in this attack.</i>

00:29.781 --> 00:31.449
Are you alone?

00:33.618 --> 00:34.869
<i>That's called a femtocell.</i>

00:34.953 --> 00:38.456
<i>So we can get
every FBI e-mail,
text message and document.</i>

00:38.581 --> 00:39.874
We just owned the FBI.

00:39.958 --> 00:42.794
They have something called
"Operation Berenstain."

00:42.877 --> 00:44.379
Possibly heavy surveillance.

00:46.715 --> 00:49.759
They're trying to cover
their tracks. And right now,
we're the tracks.

01:09.154 --> 01:11.239
Oh, uh,
go ahead.

01:13.616 --> 01:17.954
Oh. Whole milk.
Must be some kind
of revolutionary.

01:18.830 --> 01:21.332
Uh, no, I, um...
Just 'cause everyone's

01:21.458 --> 01:23.084
into this almond
coconut shit nowadays.

01:23.168 --> 01:24.335
It's, um...

01:25.962 --> 01:27.130
Not...

01:48.109 --> 01:49.694
What kind of phone
do you have?

01:51.029 --> 01:52.447
Oh, uh, this? Um...

01:52.530 --> 01:54.532
Yeah, it's a Nexus.

01:54.616 --> 01:56.367
Yeah,
I'm an Android guy.

01:56.493 --> 01:57.535
Hate Apple.

01:57.660 --> 02:01.372
Think iPhones are for pussies.
What are you on?

02:01.539 --> 02:03.166
iPhone.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.127
Right.

02:09.047 --> 02:10.548
You think they suck so much,

02:10.632 --> 02:12.717
but they're faster.

02:13.218 --> 02:15.053
Uh, bullshit.

02:15.178 --> 02:18.056
I mean, if you're talking
boot times, then
it's Android all day,

02:18.181 --> 02:19.474
and if you're
talking net speed,

02:19.557 --> 02:22.560
Chrome on Android
has better HTML5 compliance

02:22.644 --> 02:26.022
and runs JavaScript
so much faster than Safari.

02:26.815 --> 02:28.233
No competition.

02:28.358 --> 02:29.567
Oh, yeah?

02:30.527 --> 02:31.736
Prove it.

02:31.820 --> 02:33.822
Go to this
benchmarking website.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.534
We'll compare speeds.

02:38.576 --> 02:39.744
Okay.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.079
Game on.

02:46.251 --> 02:48.670
Are you on
the Wi-Fi here?
Yeah.

02:48.753 --> 02:51.172
It's slow as shit.

02:51.256 --> 02:55.426
Agreed. It's hit or miss.
There's another
Ron's Coffee Shop.

02:55.510 --> 02:58.930
14th Street. Yeah,
I know. Everyone always
reddits about that one.

02:59.055 --> 03:00.348
Crazy fast.

03:00.431 --> 03:03.560
You can practically stream
4K videos on your laptop.

03:06.062 --> 03:07.689
Why aren't you
there now, then?

03:11.401 --> 03:14.529
You got me.
iPhones suck.

03:16.281 --> 03:20.952
I'm, uh, meeting someone.
What about you?

03:21.911 --> 03:24.080
Same.
Cool, cool, cool.

03:27.458 --> 03:31.546
Oh, the old malicious
browser benchmark trick.

03:31.629 --> 03:34.465
I see you already own
this newb's whole system.

03:34.549 --> 03:35.884
I like it.

03:36.467 --> 03:39.053
Didn't your mom ever tell you
not to surf websites

03:39.137 --> 03:41.556
that have an embedded
Stagefright exploit?

03:41.931 --> 03:45.810
Can't drop the proverbial soap
around a black-hat bitch
like this, Mobley.

03:48.730 --> 03:50.064
Darlene, I...

03:50.773 --> 03:52.275
I thought I was
meeting Elliot.

03:52.901 --> 03:54.110
Me, too.

03:54.986 --> 03:58.740
Relax, kids, this isn't
the Stranger Danger episode.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.827
Elliot couldn't make it,
but no need to connip.

04:02.952 --> 04:04.329
I'll download you.

04:07.332 --> 04:09.751
Well, I'm not gonna shout.
Get over here, tubs.

04:09.834 --> 04:10.835
Don't...

04:13.838 --> 04:16.341
Before we start,
he wanted me to
read you guys something.

04:16.674 --> 04:19.344
Now, keep in mind
these are his words,
not mine.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.137
He's a touch melodramatic.

04:22.847 --> 04:25.099
"What I'm about to
tell you is top secret.

04:25.183 --> 04:27.268
"A conspiracy
bigger than all of us.

04:27.352 --> 04:29.354
"There's a powerful group
of people out there

04:29.479 --> 04:31.272
"that are secretly
running the world.

04:31.356 --> 04:33.191
"I'm talking about the guys
no one knows about,

04:33.316 --> 04:34.859
"the guys that are invisible,

04:34.943 --> 04:37.028
"the top 1% of the top 1%..."

04:54.796 --> 04:56.339
What's with the looks?

04:57.215 --> 04:58.383
Mmm.

05:11.646 --> 05:13.982
And this is
happening tomorrow?
Mmm-hmm.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.582
<i>Your passcode

05:31.708 --> 05:34.544
<i>Please wait

05:35.545 --> 05:36.879
<i>Hello?</i>

05:37.839 --> 05:39.173
<i>Hello?</i>

05:39.257 --> 05:42.427
<i>Hey, Douglas Gitelman, WFO.</i>

05:42.552 --> 05:44.679
<i>Lorin Connor,

05:45.430 --> 05:47.932
<i>Hi, guys,

05:48.057 --> 05:49.267
<i>Anyone else on?</i>

05:49.392 --> 05:51.102
<i>Just waiting on you.</i>

05:51.185 --> 05:52.937
<i>Hello, all.
Everyone on?</i>

05:53.062 --> 05:56.024
<i>It's Kirby, Megan, and Zach
from the seventh floor.</i>

05:56.107 --> 05:57.358
<i>Yup, all here.</i>

05:57.442 --> 05:59.110
<i>Great. Don't have
a ton of time.</i>

05:59.235 --> 06:00.945
<i>It's the nation's birthday,
after all,</i>

06:01.070 --> 06:03.114
<i>so let's get down
to brass tacks.</i>

06:06.075 --> 06:11.289
<i>E Corp, Google,
AT&T, Uber, Apple,
Verizon, Facebook,</i>

06:11.414 --> 06:14.375
<i>all 23 of these
listed companies
have been complicit</i>

06:14.459 --> 06:17.128
<i>in aiding the FBI in
Operation Berenstain.</i>

06:19.464 --> 06:21.466
<i>Jesus, what is that noise?</i>

06:26.429 --> 06:28.181
Okay, tape's busted.

06:28.306 --> 06:31.309
Just grab another one
and we'll do it again.
Yeah.

06:43.154 --> 06:45.573
Okay.
Fuck it.
I'll keep it simple.

06:46.783 --> 06:49.577
Happy Fourth of July,
fellow Americans.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.997
On this patriotic holiday,
we wanted to remind you,

06:53.122 --> 06:55.917
under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.835
privacy is a right.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.337
Or at least
it used to be.

06:59.462 --> 07:03.341
Listen closely to
a classified conference call
we recently intercepted

07:03.466 --> 07:06.677
<i>between the FBI agents
that so earnestly promise you</i>

07:06.761 --> 07:09.680
<i>fidelity, bravery,
and integrity.</i>

07:27.031 --> 07:28.533
<i>Come on, Kirby,
screw the three million.</i>

07:28.658 --> 07:31.536
<i>They got us the 17
we're building
our case around now.</i>

07:34.664 --> 07:36.624
<i>Doesn't help
that Comey hasn't
signed off on it.</i>

07:36.707 --> 07:38.334
<i>The fact that we're
keeping it from him</i>

07:38.459 --> 07:39.961
<i>does not bode
well for your case.</i>

07:40.044 --> 07:41.712
<i>He's an uptight choirboy.</i>

07:41.838 --> 07:43.798
<i>No one's gonna be crying over
how we catch these terrorists.</i>

07:43.881 --> 07:45.299
<i>I guarantee that.</i>

07:45.383 --> 07:47.885
<i>The FBI has three million
of you innocent citizens</i>

07:48.010 --> 07:50.304
<i>under surveillance
for no reason.</i>

07:50.388 --> 07:54.559
<i>Their tyrannical rape
of our private data ends now.</i>

07:54.684 --> 07:56.894
<i>FBI, be warned.</i>

07:57.019 --> 08:00.565
<i>Your access to our
lives is officially denied.</i>

08:00.690 --> 08:02.650
<i>Pursue us at your own peril.</i>

08:02.733 --> 08:04.318
<i>We do not compromise.</i>

08:04.402 --> 08:06.237
<i>We will not back down.</i>

08:06.362 --> 08:07.905
<i>We will destroy you.</i>

08:08.030 --> 08:10.408
<i>We are fsociety.</i>

08:37.560 --> 08:38.686
Video's up.

08:45.860 --> 08:49.530
Stop listening to that.
It's making you more paranoid.

08:49.614 --> 08:52.283
What about this, um,
code name case thing?

08:52.742 --> 08:55.536
They said they
have 16 suspects
under surveillance.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.705
Video's getting hits.
It's starting to get reposted.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.541
They said one of the suspects

09:01.417 --> 09:03.294
is dead.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.297
They gotta be talking
about Romero, right?

09:06.422 --> 09:08.591
We have to be on that list.

09:10.092 --> 09:12.887
I uploaded
the full Berenstain call
and transcript to WikiLeaks.

09:12.970 --> 09:16.224
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, slow your roll, bro.
No one's going anywhere.

09:16.307 --> 09:19.393
We gotta monitor
the fallout of the video
before anyone makes a move.

09:19.477 --> 09:22.063
Exposing their program
is gonna shut down
the investigation.

09:22.146 --> 09:24.607
I don't care anymore.
I'm officially done.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.484
You don't wanna do this.

09:26.567 --> 09:31.781
You mean the, uh, Dark Army
doesn't want me
to do this, bro?

09:32.448 --> 09:34.575
No, no, no, no, I mean you.

09:34.659 --> 09:36.118
'Cause when
the Dark Army finds out

09:36.160 --> 09:38.496
the FBI nails you,
which they will.
Hmm.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.666
It's lights out, no questions
asked. You feel me?

09:43.751 --> 09:45.169
Hey, stop.

09:45.253 --> 09:47.129
You really think you
can force me to stay?

09:48.005 --> 09:49.006
Without a doubt.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.132
Guys!

10:05.356 --> 10:07.358
<i>One of us sitting</i>

10:07.483 --> 10:09.485
<i>At my window...</i>

10:13.114 --> 10:15.950
<i>Happy Fourth of July,
fellow Americans.</i>

10:16.033 --> 10:19.120
<i>On this patriotic holiday,
we wanted to remind you,</i>

10:19.203 --> 10:22.164
<i>under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights...</i>

10:22.873 --> 10:23.874
Yo.

10:25.001 --> 10:27.628
We're still on a date,
remember?

10:27.712 --> 10:30.006
Why is this video
such a big deal to you?

10:33.509 --> 10:35.177
I'm gonna get another drink.

10:47.857 --> 10:49.233
Hey, hey there, Ang.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.906
Steve?
What are you doing here?

10:56.032 --> 10:59.535
Karaoke. You know,
gotta please the missus.

11:00.578 --> 11:03.080
Missed you at your
dad's barbecue today.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.416
Yeah, I couldn't make it.

11:05.541 --> 11:08.502
Right. Yeah, right.
You gotta be busy these days.

11:08.586 --> 11:10.588
Congrats on everything.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.758
Still, though, that's gotta be
tough on your father, though.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.509
Having to watch
while you bow down

11:15.593 --> 11:18.220
to those bastards
that killed your mother.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.432
That can't be an easy
pill for him to swallow.

11:22.725 --> 11:26.937
For you, though,
swallowing's not really
a problem, now, is it?

11:29.023 --> 11:32.860
Just who the hell do you think
you are, anyway?

11:54.590 --> 11:56.634
You're a plumber.

11:57.927 --> 11:59.428
Right, Steve?

12:02.098 --> 12:03.641
You've had, what,

12:04.809 --> 12:06.811
sixty years at life?

12:08.479 --> 12:11.107
That's the best
you can come up with?

12:13.275 --> 12:15.444
Literally cleaning
shit for a living?

12:18.114 --> 12:19.782
I'm 27,

12:20.658 --> 12:24.954
and I've got a 6-figure salary
at the biggest
conglomerate in history.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.665
And I'm just getting started.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.841
That's who I am.

12:44.682 --> 12:46.183
Don't do this!

12:46.308 --> 12:50.521
Now you're only at Class B
felony kidnapping charges.

12:50.646 --> 12:51.981
Don't bump it up to Class A.

12:52.106 --> 12:53.441
Shut the fuck up!

12:57.194 --> 12:59.989
You have no idea
the shit you're in.

13:06.537 --> 13:08.539
One of us should have been
watching the GPS.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.374
This is some next
level shit, man.

13:10.499 --> 13:13.210
Okay, we didn't have a choice.
We couldn't let
her go to the cops.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.962
Yeah, well,
she can ID all of us now.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.882
She saw everything,
our whole setup.
She knows who we are.

13:18.007 --> 13:21.886
<i>- Help!
- Hello? I know you can see me!</i>

13:22.011 --> 13:25.848
God damn it.
Trenton, go shut her up. Go!

13:29.059 --> 13:30.561
Fuck it.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.314
I say we take our
chances out there.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.065
Let her go. Take off.

13:35.191 --> 13:36.650
- Go our separate ways.
- Yeah, right.

13:36.734 --> 13:38.068
Then there'll be a manhunt
with our faces on it.

13:38.194 --> 13:39.487
Yeah,
if there isn't one already.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.738
Hello!

13:46.535 --> 13:48.329
I need the bathroom.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.164
Not yet.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.208
I kind of can't control it.

13:53.501 --> 13:54.919
Let me check downstairs first.

13:55.044 --> 13:57.838
I really need to go.

13:57.922 --> 13:59.924
It'll only take a second.

14:10.059 --> 14:13.187
You guys don't know what
the hell you're doing, do you?

14:15.064 --> 14:16.398
You're Muslim?

14:18.526 --> 14:19.735
Is that what
all this is about?

14:21.070 --> 14:23.239
ISIS, or something?

14:24.573 --> 14:26.951
You're all a bunch
of goddamn animals.

14:27.076 --> 14:28.577
Make it quick.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.957
We were all there.
You heard the call.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.209
They have a secret
surveillance program on us.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.877
Jesus, you're a broken record.

14:36.961 --> 14:40.965
Man, you wanna
live in denial,
go ahead, okay?

14:41.090 --> 14:42.049
Go right ahead.

14:42.132 --> 14:45.052
All of you can't
accept the fact
that maybe we...up.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.805
Okay? Take a look at the city.
It's going to shit, man.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.683
Now, first it'll be blackouts.
Then it'll be
the National Guard.

14:50.808 --> 14:53.894
Either we go now, or...
Jesus!
Keep it together!

14:56.272 --> 14:57.648
Um...

14:59.400 --> 15:00.609
Darlene.

15:03.821 --> 15:06.323
This isn't exactly
what I meant by "shut her up."

15:08.576 --> 15:10.119
Okay, well...

15:12.454 --> 15:14.582
Maybe our
problem solved itself.

15:14.665 --> 15:16.917
So, what,
we just let her die?

15:17.001 --> 15:18.502
We need to get
her to a hospital.

15:18.586 --> 15:19.628
No.

15:21.088 --> 15:25.175
No, not until we're
sure she won't talk.
And tie her up.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.261
That's a nasty head wound.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.430
Okay, well,
then we don't have much time.

15:29.513 --> 15:30.848
To do what?

15:30.973 --> 15:32.266
Own her.

15:43.777 --> 15:47.531
<i>Welcome to your life</i>

15:48.699 --> 15:51.285
<i>There's no turning back</i>

15:51.368 --> 15:52.995
Grab her phone.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.873
<i>Even while we sleep</i>

15:55.998 --> 15:57.124
Got it.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.459
I'll jump on her laptop.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.377
<i>We will find you</i>

16:00.502 --> 16:02.713
<i>Acting on your</i>

16:02.796 --> 16:04.965
<i>Best behavior</i>

16:05.049 --> 16:09.803
<i>Turn your back on
Mother Nature...</i>

16:09.887 --> 16:11.889
She's got three
e-mail accounts
on her phone.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.976
<i>Everybody wants
to rule the world</i>

16:17.728 --> 16:20.898
Not seeing anything
on her corporate or Hotmail.

16:26.862 --> 16:30.199
<i>It's my own desire</i>

16:30.532 --> 16:32.743
There's gotta be
something we can
blackmail her with.

16:32.868 --> 16:33.911
Just keep looking.

16:36.497 --> 16:39.249
<i>Help me to decide</i>

16:41.585 --> 16:43.587
<i>Help me make</i>

16:43.671 --> 16:48.342
<i>The most of freedom
and of pleasure</i>

16:48.425 --> 16:53.097
<i>Nothing ever lasts forever</i>

16:53.180 --> 16:54.848
<i>Everybody wants</i>

16:54.932 --> 16:57.518
I got into her Gmail.
Don't see anything in here.

16:57.601 --> 16:58.852
Did you check for
any hidden partitions?

16:58.936 --> 17:00.104
Obviously.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.438
I'll check the office.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.940
<i>The light won't find you</i>

17:03.524 --> 17:08.028
<i>Holding hands while the
walls come crumblin' down</i>

17:08.112 --> 17:09.697
Okay, anything?
No, nothing.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.448
She's a lawyer.
She's gotta have dirt.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.869
Wait, I see Yahoo
Mail in her web history.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.621
Maybe we do, uh, uh,
a pass on her drive?

17:17.788 --> 17:19.456
Try to recover
any deleted files.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.875
<i>Had to fade it</i>

17:21.959 --> 17:27.548
<i>Everybody wants
to rule the world</i>

17:27.631 --> 17:29.299
Maybe we could
target Yahoo's server logs

17:29.425 --> 17:31.468
and cross-reference any
incoming connections
from here.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.470
Might lead to an account name
and password hash.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.390
- I could use Bash bug.
- Or what about this?

17:50.112 --> 17:52.281
What if we do find
something on her?

17:52.573 --> 17:55.284
Huh? What then?

17:58.454 --> 18:01.123
Cazadores on the rocks,
please.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.294
I love that song.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.840
You really have
a desire to rule the world?

18:12.801 --> 18:15.679
My desires
go way beyond that.

18:20.809 --> 18:23.270
Pretty sure my
daughter's older than you.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.358
What about
your granddaughter?

18:28.859 --> 18:33.447
No, no, she'll be 10 tomorrow.
I'm taking her to the zoo,
actually.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.203
Thanks.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.998
Well, better get
back to my colleagues.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.501
You could do that,

18:46.001 --> 18:47.544
or you could stay here,

18:48.879 --> 18:50.672
talk to me.

18:56.804 --> 18:59.556
I had nothing to
do with Five/Nine.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.225
I'm in finance,
for fuck's sake.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.852
You think I wanted to
implode the economy?
Come on...

19:06.396 --> 19:08.816
No, I agree
with Mr. Jones here.

19:08.899 --> 19:11.568
I've been scratching
my head on this one,

19:11.693 --> 19:13.403
but evidence is evidence,

19:13.529 --> 19:16.406
and holiday or not,
I had to follow up on this.

19:18.242 --> 19:19.910
Found this
incriminating little guy

19:20.035 --> 19:22.663
at a critical location
tied to the Five/Nine hack.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.749
The shell's micro-stamp leads
right to your client's gun.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.752
A gun that he had
in the City of New York
illegally, I might add.

19:32.589 --> 19:36.385
Immunity is on the table
in exchange for a name.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.389
That's all I care about.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.708
Let's keep this friendly.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.268
I need a doctor.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.939
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.182
Nice place you got.

21:06.683 --> 21:07.851
Comfy.

21:09.478 --> 21:11.521
Is your place in
Greenwich this cush?

21:14.441 --> 21:16.526
I worked hard
for what I have.

21:23.867 --> 21:27.287
You know,
I'm glad you came home,

21:28.372 --> 21:30.958
but my friends
are freaking out.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.044
Came up with this
neat little plan

21:34.127 --> 21:36.296
to blackmail you
for your silence.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.548
Hacked your e-mails.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.302
We got some good stuff, too.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.890
Nice little
Petraeus e-mail scam
you got going on there.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.142
You shouldn't
get hot and heavy

21:49.226 --> 21:50.978
with your
presiding judges, Suze.

21:51.061 --> 21:54.022
I'm sure you're
aware that's illegal,

21:56.817 --> 21:59.569
but I know you don't care
about things like that.

22:00.654 --> 22:04.825
You'd slime your way around it
and fuck us over,
just like you did my dad.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.664
Who's dead, by the way.

22:11.707 --> 22:13.083
But you...

22:21.883 --> 22:23.593
You aged very well.

22:29.433 --> 22:32.102
The first time I
saw you, I was four.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.771
Still remember it.

22:37.733 --> 22:40.360
On the news, in the courtroom,

22:40.444 --> 22:44.948
when they cleared E Corp
of all the bullshit
they put my family through.

22:52.956 --> 22:54.624
And you were in the back

22:55.792 --> 22:58.086
behind a sea of suits,

22:59.379 --> 23:00.964
and you laughed.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.136
It was so quick,
no one even noticed.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.056
No one but me.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.476
Four-year-old little me.

23:17.481 --> 23:18.982
So,

23:19.066 --> 23:23.236
I'm happy I get to
look you in the eye.

23:23.320 --> 23:27.157
I have taken
down your company,
taken over your home,

23:27.991 --> 23:29.659
and now...

23:31.745 --> 23:33.080
I have you.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.003
Okay.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.340
So, you got me.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.935
Where do we go from here?

23:55.685 --> 23:58.355
I'm sure we can
figure something out.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.028
I already have.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.906
She just

24:50.407 --> 24:51.408
flipped out.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.704
I was just trying
to scare her back.

24:58.415 --> 25:00.333
It was just a stun gun.

25:01.251 --> 25:02.752
No.

25:02.878 --> 25:04.337
No, she...

25:04.421 --> 25:06.548
No, she
had a heart condition.

25:07.340 --> 25:11.511
I mean,
there were lots of e-mails
from her doctor.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.682
You didn't see any of those?

25:18.351 --> 25:19.936
No.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.279
Just go.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.866
You two don't need to be here.

25:33.867 --> 25:37.621
We'll wipe down
the house and figure it out.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.217
You think she actually...

27:20.724 --> 27:22.809
Has to be self-defense.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.152
What's the plan?

27:35.488 --> 27:37.407
We can't stay here.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.492
Who knows who's
gonna be waiting
for you at home?

27:39.576 --> 27:41.578
Dark Army, FBI, cops.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.831
I can't leave my family.

27:46.416 --> 27:48.168
If you had
that much to lose,

27:48.251 --> 27:50.587
you shouldn't have done this
in the first place.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.756
But I did this for them.

27:52.881 --> 27:56.259
What we did was
colossally fucking stupid,

27:56.384 --> 27:59.012
and we can't afford
not to realize that anymore.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.186
Peace, Trent.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.400
Yeah,
I'm on my way.

28:25.622 --> 28:29.209
All right, my vote,
we leave it here,

28:29.292 --> 28:32.545
wipe our prints,
and just make a run for it.

28:32.629 --> 28:33.963
We can't.

28:34.923 --> 28:37.550
The others'll be back soon.
They'll find her.

28:38.301 --> 28:41.638
Why don't I
just text them

28:41.763 --> 28:43.598
and tell them
the place is burned?

28:44.474 --> 28:47.769
Can't take the risk
they won't listen and
come back anyway.

28:50.939 --> 28:53.233
We need to
get rid of it.

28:55.151 --> 28:58.655
We ain't doing shit.
I'll see if my guys
can take care of it.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.658
Okay, no offense,
but I don't trust them either.

29:06.830 --> 29:08.915
This is my responsibility.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.128
Well, if this is the part
of the conversation

29:13.253 --> 29:15.004
where you start
throwing out ideas

29:15.130 --> 29:18.299
like acid and wood chippers,
I ain't obliging.

29:20.176 --> 29:22.178
This isn't a conversation.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.681
We need to do
what we always do

29:24.806 --> 29:27.434
when we go into
full wipe-down mode
after a hack.

30:02.886 --> 30:04.179
Hurry up.

30:11.895 --> 30:13.980
You know you
screwed me last time?

30:14.063 --> 30:17.066
You let all the dogs go.
I almost got fired.

30:17.192 --> 30:18.526
What was that
all about anyway?

30:20.069 --> 30:22.155
Not like it matters.
They all ended up back here.

30:22.238 --> 30:25.325
So, as a matter of policy,
it's gonna cost
you double this time.

30:25.408 --> 30:26.576
Double?

30:27.410 --> 30:29.746
Wait,
we don't have double, man.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.332
We can barely pull out cash.
What about Ecoin?

30:33.041 --> 30:35.168
It's worth more
than cash anyway.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.670
Pull out your phone.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.718
What the fuck is in there?

30:44.427 --> 30:46.888
I'm paying you
enough for privacy.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.272
It's done.

30:57.732 --> 30:59.067
All yours.

31:07.617 --> 31:10.578
Susan donated them
from her cold storage.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.082
It's not as if she
can use them anymore.

31:15.416 --> 31:17.752
She can pay for
her own funeral.

31:21.798 --> 31:25.134
Oh, easy, easy, wait.
Just move it.

31:32.225 --> 31:33.601
Rug's too big.

31:33.768 --> 31:35.103
No shit.

31:40.275 --> 31:42.277
We need to take her out.

31:46.447 --> 31:49.450
This is some
traumatizing shit.
You know that?

32:12.181 --> 32:13.349
Hey.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.769
Come over to my place tonight.

32:17.979 --> 32:20.356
Come on, let's get
some sleep. You shouldn't
be alone right now.

32:20.481 --> 32:22.358
I didn't know
I could do that.

32:27.780 --> 32:30.033
You did
what you had to do.

32:31.326 --> 32:33.161
No, that's the thing.

32:35.163 --> 32:37.498
I don't feel bad.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.376
I always knew
there was a part of me

32:40.460 --> 32:43.880
that wanted to do this to her
for what she did, but...

32:45.298 --> 32:48.051
I figured, when the time came,

32:48.134 --> 32:50.553
something would stop me.

32:52.513 --> 32:54.015
But it didn't.

33:02.899 --> 33:07.070
Hey, come on.
Look, you're just in shock.
All right? Look, come on.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.738
Just...

33:08.821 --> 33:11.032
Let's get some sleep,
okay?

33:26.923 --> 33:28.174
I did what
you say for me.

33:28.257 --> 33:30.760
Okay, I used key under mat.
I put pizza inside.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.762
No one inside. No one.

33:33.596 --> 33:35.848
You didn't see
anything weird or...

33:35.932 --> 33:38.059
No, no one inside.
No one inside.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.728
Okay, fine.

33:43.523 --> 33:44.899
That's $20.

33:46.776 --> 33:48.277
Wait. Uh...

33:49.904 --> 33:52.115
Can I
have the other pizza?

33:53.533 --> 33:56.786
- It's another delivery, man.
- It's another delivery.

33:56.869 --> 33:58.621
Look, give me the other pizza.
I'm fucking nervous, man.

34:05.545 --> 34:07.880
Have you guys ever
thought about moving?

34:07.964 --> 34:09.424
What's this?

34:10.091 --> 34:12.802
Maybe we should
move somewhere cheaper.

34:15.430 --> 34:19.308
I don't think
the city is safe anymore,
not with everything going on.

34:19.392 --> 34:21.978
Don't be silly. Moving
is impossible right now.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.980
The bank is
fighting us on the deed.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.065
It's a mess. They're
not letting anyone sell.

34:26.149 --> 34:27.692
In fact,
we may be at a bigger risk

34:27.775 --> 34:30.403
of losing the money
we did invest in this home.

34:30.486 --> 34:32.238
But we can find
another place.

34:46.002 --> 34:48.963
Dinner's almost ready.
I'll check outside.

35:26.542 --> 35:29.003
Sir, open up. FBI.

35:32.965 --> 35:36.052
Sir,
if you don't open the door,
we're gonna break it down.

35:49.941 --> 35:53.611
Mr. Markesh, we didn't
mean for you to be
waiting here this long,

35:53.694 --> 35:55.404
but with all
the bureaucracy and red tape,

35:55.530 --> 35:57.240
it's getting a little
bonkers around here.

35:57.323 --> 36:01.202
Yeah, well, I've been
waiting here all night.
What the fuck is going on?

36:01.285 --> 36:03.871
I feel your pain.

36:03.955 --> 36:06.457
I've been stuck
here all night, too.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.252
It's depressing,
isn't it?

36:14.006 --> 36:15.466
Here's what we're gonna do.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.345
We're gonna talk, and all
you have to do is listen.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.472
Because, believe it
or not, Mr. Markesh,

36:21.556 --> 36:25.142
you could be real instrumental
in helping to solve
this Five/Nine case.

36:28.145 --> 36:29.647
Leslie Romero.

36:38.155 --> 36:41.534
Forgive me, hon, you do know
your friend was
found murdered?

36:47.456 --> 36:50.084
My heart goes out to you.
It's very unfortunate.

36:52.128 --> 36:55.172
I went over to his mother's
after everything went down.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.133
I wanted to
offer my condolences,

36:57.216 --> 36:59.844
and I took a quick look around
while I was over there.

37:00.970 --> 37:02.263
That's when I found this.

37:02.847 --> 37:06.100
An end of the world party
featuring DJ Mobley.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.353
I'm not an EDM fan myself,

37:09.437 --> 37:11.105
but a quick search on
the Wayback Machine,

37:11.188 --> 37:14.191
and guess
what we found all
the way from 2003?

37:14.275 --> 37:15.318
You.

37:16.277 --> 37:19.864
An Angelfire page
that you created
from back in the day.

37:19.947 --> 37:22.783
Your very own
DJ Mobley fan page.

37:22.867 --> 37:24.619
In fact, curiously enough,

37:24.702 --> 37:27.747
you were the only one
that ever created
a fan page of this guy.

37:28.539 --> 37:31.208
Must have really spoken
to you.

37:31.709 --> 37:32.710
Trust me, I feel the same way

37:32.793 --> 37:34.754
about <i>Romy and Michele's
High School Reunion.</i>

37:37.131 --> 37:39.800
But like you, I found myself
very much in the minority.

37:46.265 --> 37:47.767
So, a big fan.

37:47.850 --> 37:50.728
Obscure DJ with a unique name.

37:50.811 --> 37:54.732
Seems like the perfect recipe
for how a hacker
handle gets born.

37:59.612 --> 38:00.863
Here's the deal.

38:00.947 --> 38:05.576
We want Tyrell Wellick,
not Tyrell Wellick's DJ.

38:05.660 --> 38:08.079
Your friend is dead,
and that's a sad thing,

38:08.162 --> 38:10.081
but at this point,
the best thing
that could happen

38:10.164 --> 38:12.667
would be if there's something
you can tell me.

38:13.334 --> 38:16.253
Names, people,

38:16.337 --> 38:18.464
any information at all

38:18.547 --> 38:21.759
that you can give
us from that party
that would help.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.858
Lawyer.

38:39.568 --> 38:41.195
I want a lawyer.

38:45.992 --> 38:50.371
Do you have any evidence on
this guy? This is not the
strategy we have implemented.

38:50.454 --> 38:52.456
Top down, not bottom up.

38:52.540 --> 38:56.335
We needed to
get some traction.
This is a way.

38:56.419 --> 38:58.254
He's a minor player
that won't blow our strategy.

38:58.337 --> 38:59.797
He'll start flushing
some of these guys out.

38:59.880 --> 39:02.049
Are you not
watching the news?

39:02.133 --> 39:06.887
We are in a world of shit
because of this
leaked conference call.

39:06.971 --> 39:10.057
The OPR is going to be
coming down on us any day.

39:10.141 --> 39:12.143
It's all over the Senate
Intelligence Hearings.

39:12.226 --> 39:14.687
The deputy director,
assistant director
of Cyber Division,

39:14.770 --> 39:18.149
and the EAD are
all getting fired.

39:18.232 --> 39:21.277
Comey's about to announce
that Operation
Berenstain is dead,

39:21.360 --> 39:25.656
and you just held
this guy for 12 hours
for no reason.

39:25.740 --> 39:28.242
You have to think about
how this looks, Dom.

39:36.459 --> 39:39.670
Whatever paranoia
you've put into him is done,

39:39.754 --> 39:41.672
just by picking him up.

39:42.590 --> 39:43.966
Let him go.

41:05.673 --> 41:07.633
I'll be back later.

41:46.922 --> 41:49.258
I lost her.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.844
I don't know what I did wrong.
I thought she was into me.

41:51.927 --> 41:53.470
Don't let it get
you in the dumps.

41:53.554 --> 41:55.181
Getting into
the mind of a woman,

41:55.264 --> 41:57.808
it's the toughest route
for even the best sources.

41:58.601 --> 42:01.562
I can't get into it right now.
This fsociety video's
blowing up in our face.

42:02.271 --> 42:04.481
That's some
fucked-up shit you guys did.

42:04.565 --> 42:05.816
It's got me all paranoid.

42:05.900 --> 42:08.611
How do I know you guys
aren't watching me, too?

42:08.694 --> 42:11.238
We look like fools.
Shit's worse than Snowden.

42:14.909 --> 42:16.327
Speak of the devil.

42:16.410 --> 42:18.495
<i>Because I have nothing
to hide, that's no different
than saying</i>

42:18.579 --> 42:21.207
<i>I don't care about
freedom of speech
because I have nothing to say.</i>

42:21.415 --> 42:23.500
<i>Despite the
cyber security breach</i>

42:23.584 --> 42:25.920
<i>in obtaining the information
on Operation Berenstain,</i>

42:26.003 --> 42:28.088
<i>the controversy
over privacy rights</i>

42:28.172 --> 42:30.841
<i>has prompted calls for greater
government transparency.</i>

42:32.092 --> 42:36.764
Look, I'm done with this.
You know, she's
stone cold anyway, Dom.

42:36.847 --> 42:40.768
I'm not gonna lie.
I kind of got hurt.

42:41.894 --> 42:43.604
She never
talked about fsociety

42:43.771 --> 42:45.439
or her old friends
from back in the day?

42:45.522 --> 42:48.359
She hasn't given up anything
since you first put me on her,

42:48.442 --> 42:50.861
and she bailed on me
for some old dude at the bar.

42:50.945 --> 42:51.987
A contact?

42:53.489 --> 42:55.616
I think she's
just into old dudes.

43:20.140 --> 43:21.308
Cisco?

43:33.153 --> 43:34.697
Cisco?

43:34.780 --> 43:36.282
Yo, what's up?

43:51.005 --> 43:52.339
What's up?

44:01.974 --> 44:04.059
How long you been up?

44:04.143 --> 44:05.894
I just got up.

44:05.978 --> 44:08.939
I jumped
straight in the shower.
I'll be out in a sec, though.

44:09.023 --> 44:10.357
You all right?

44:16.864 --> 44:19.241
Yeah, fine.

45:34.608 --> 45:36.110
You all right?

45:44.576 --> 45:46.078
Yo, what the fuck?
