WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.038
Tina: ERIC!

00:08.342 --> 00:09.643
ERIC!

00:15.616 --> 00:16.684
ERIC?!

00:19.487 --> 00:21.355
ERIC!

00:31.399 --> 00:33.367
ERIC?! ERIC!

00:38.172 --> 00:39.273
ERIC!

00:39.307 --> 00:41.675
ERIC, HONEY!

00:41.709 --> 00:43.177
ERIC!

00:47.815 --> 00:49.317
ERIC!

00:54.622 --> 00:58.326
ERIC, HONEY, WHERE ARE YOU?!

01:03.264 --> 01:04.765
ERIC!

01:07.468 --> 01:09.137
ERIC!

01:10.738 --> 01:12.373
ERIC!

01:12.406 --> 01:14.142
Glen:
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:14.175 --> 01:16.277
IS WHY IT TOOK ME COMING HERE
TO PICK UP MY SON

01:16.310 --> 01:18.812
FOR SOMEONE TO NOTICE THAT ERIC
NEVER SHOWED UP THIS MORNING!

01:18.846 --> 01:21.515
MR. LYNCH, THIS IS
A VOLUNTARY SUMMER CAMP.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.850
ATTENDANCE IS NOT TAKEN.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.460
I COULDN'T FIND ERIC
ANYWHERE.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.496
DAMN IT, TINA.
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

01:35.529 --> 01:36.830
WHEN HE LEFT THE HOUSE
THIS MORNING, I --

01:36.864 --> 01:39.433
"WHEN HE LEFT THE HOUSE"?

01:39.467 --> 01:41.469
AWAY FROM YOUR BOYFRIEND
LONG ENOUGH TO BRING HIM HERE?

01:41.502 --> 01:43.671
HE WANTED TO RIDE THE BIKE --
THE BIKE YOU GAVE HIM.

01:43.704 --> 01:44.838
IT'S TWO BLOCKS!

01:44.872 --> 01:47.408
THE BOY IS 9 YEARS OLD.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.145
WHA--

01:51.179 --> 01:54.682
UH, MS. NOVICK...

01:54.715 --> 01:56.817
HE'S AN L.A.P.D. DETECTIVE.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.801
Tao: SO, ERIC LYNCH'S PARENTS
ARE DIVORCED.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.270
ANY ONGOING CUSTODY ISSUES
YOU KNOW OF?

02:16.304 --> 02:19.440
IT SEEMS SETTLED.
I DON'T KNOW.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.376
ANY STEPDADS?

02:22.410 --> 02:26.647
ERIC TALKS ABOUT HIM SOMETIMES.
I THINK HIS NAME IS MARC.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.816
JULIO, IT'S TAO.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.652
I NEED YOU TO CHECK
INTO SOMETHING FOR ME.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.193
IF IT WERE AN INVESTIGATION,
I'D WANT YOUR LAWYER PRESENT.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.528
I DON'T NEED A LAWYER,
CAPTAIN.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.830
I SUGGEST YOU RETHINK
THAT DECISION.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.765
AT ANY RATE...

02:44.798 --> 02:46.634
THE DISCUSSION
WE'RE HAVING TODAY

02:46.667 --> 02:50.538
ABOUT TURELL BAYLOR
AND THE SHOOTIN' NEWTON MURDERS

02:50.571 --> 02:52.673
SHOULD REMAIN
MUCH MORE INFORMAL.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.409
YOU WILL NOTICE
I'M NOT TAKING NOTES.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.585
Tao:
IF WE HEAR ANYTHING,

03:04.618 --> 03:05.953
YOU'LL BE NOTIFIED
IMMEDIATELY.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.259
EXCUSE ME.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.261
COME ON, KEV.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.296
SAY HI
TO YOUR UNCLE JULIO.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.397
HEY, KEVIN.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.799
HEY, UNCLE JULIO.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.368
TO SEE IF THE KID
HEADED HOME.

03:20.401 --> 03:25.339
HE WASN'T THERE.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.541
AND HE WAS DOING WEIRD STUFF
IN THE BACKYARD.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.477
WHAT KIND
OF WEIRD STUFF?

03:29.510 --> 03:30.511
STRETCHING.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.647
HE SAYS HE'S A YOGA INSTRUCTOR,
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT.

03:33.681 --> 03:37.585
HE WANTS TO KEEP OUT
OF THE SEARCH

03:37.618 --> 03:40.788
OH, AND HE GAVE ME THESE --
RECENT PICTURES.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.924
THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S ERIC.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.659
LET'S HAND THEM OUT
TO PATROL.
OKAY.

03:45.693 --> 03:48.296
Tina:
IT'S ERIC'S BIKE!

03:48.329 --> 03:49.963
THAT'S ERIC'S BIKE!

03:49.997 --> 03:52.566
THAT'S ERIC'S BIKE!

03:54.335 --> 03:55.969
ALL RIGHT, DON'T TOUCH IT!
DON'T TOUCH IT, MA'AM!

03:56.003 --> 03:57.971
DON'T TOUCH IT!

04:06.914 --> 04:09.617
I TOLD YOU...

04:09.650 --> 04:11.051
NOT TO LET HIM
KEEP THE BIKE

04:11.084 --> 04:13.454
UNLESS HE USED IT
RESPONSIBLY.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.655
WAS IT HERE BEFORE?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.890
I-I-I DON'T KNOW!

04:16.924 --> 04:21.729
THE HOUSE
IS A BLOCK AND A HALF AWAY.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.697
MAYBE! I DON'T KNOW!
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW?!

04:23.731 --> 04:24.965
SIR, THAT'S ENOUGH.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.434
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW?!
I DON'T KNOW!

04:26.467 --> 04:29.703
SIR, I SAID
THAT'S ENOUGH!

04:40.414 --> 04:41.882
PROVENZA...

04:41.915 --> 04:44.385
IT'S TAO.

04:48.088 --> 04:52.693
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT STORE?

04:52.726 --> 04:55.396
AND IT CAN'T BE USED AGAINST ME
IN COURT?

04:55.429 --> 04:57.064
Brenda: NO, IT CAN'T.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.833
FINE, THEN.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.068
I DID IT.

05:01.101 --> 05:05.439
YOU DID WHAT?

05:05.473 --> 05:08.342
I DID.
I KILLED THOSE PEOPLE.

05:19.387 --> 05:23.991
Raydor:
SO, AFTER THIS INTERVIEW

05:24.024 --> 05:25.626
YOU RETURNED HIM HOME.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.396
AT HIS REQUEST, YES.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.064
AND YOU SAW SEVERAL PEOPLE
THERE, WAITING FOR HIM.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.000
DEFINE "SEVERAL."

05:33.033 --> 05:36.003
DID YOU THINK
THAT THEY WERE MEMBERS

05:36.036 --> 05:38.439
OF HIS OWN GANG,
THE 110 CRIPS?

05:38.472 --> 05:40.073
JUST BECAUSE
THEY WERE AFRICAN-AMERICAN

05:40.107 --> 05:41.842
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY WERE GANG MEMBERS.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.379
DID YOU KNOW THAT
THERE WAS A STRONG LIKELIHOOD

05:45.413 --> 05:47.981
THAT AFTER YOU DROPPED
MR. BAYLOR OFF AT HIS HOME,

05:48.015 --> 05:50.117
HE'D BE BEATEN TO DEATH
BY HIS FELLOW CRIPS?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.985
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.523
BUT I DO LIKE
HAPPY ENDINGS.

05:55.556 --> 05:59.427
AND THAT ANSWER

06:00.193 --> 06:03.397
CALLING TURELL'S MURDER
A "HAPPY ENDING"

06:03.431 --> 06:07.401
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT
A JURY TO HEAR YOU SAY!

06:07.435 --> 06:11.472
SURE WE DO...

06:12.440 --> 06:14.174
AFTER THEY SEE
THIS INTERVIEW,

06:14.207 --> 06:15.943
THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
WERE STUCK WITH THE CONFESSION

06:15.976 --> 06:18.946
OF A BRUTAL MURDER OF AN
ELDERLY MAN AND HIS GRANDCHILD

06:18.979 --> 06:20.748
THAT YOU COULDN'T USE
AT TRIAL.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.550
AND LACKING LEGAL RECOURSE,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.452
YOU DROPPED TURELL BAYLOR OFF
AT HIS HOME,

06:24.485 --> 06:26.987
WHERE YOU KNEW HE WAS LIKELY
TO BE EXECUTED.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.523
THIS INTERVIEW
IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.991
IT IS YOUR MOTIVE.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.193
OKAY.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.728
SO I NEED TO FIND OUT
WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.129
AND YOU WILL...

06:36.163 --> 06:37.865
AFTER WE FINISH.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.202
I'VE INTERVIEWED EVERY MEMBER
OF YOUR DIVISION.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.137
I PROMISE
THEY ARE FULLY COMPETENT

06:44.171 --> 06:46.640
TO HANDLE WHATEVER
THE WORLD THROWS AT THEM.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.514
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT WOULD HELP
IF YOU'D JUST TELL ME

06:53.547 --> 06:55.215
IN SIMPLE ENGLISH WHAT IT IS
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.151
PROVENZA: We are hunting for
a 9-year-old male Caucasian --

06:58.185 --> 07:02.590
4'6", blond hair, and blue eyes.

07:02.623 --> 07:06.594
Last seen wearing
a yellow t-shirt, khaki pants,

07:06.627 --> 07:08.862
and red tennis shoes.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.832
Keep an eye on the trees
and backyards, people.

07:11.865 --> 07:15.035
We need
to bring this kid home.

07:15.068 --> 07:18.906
Let's go a little bit wider,
partner.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.041
Let's try a little bit
outside the perimeter here.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.043
Maybe we can get lucky.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.684
LIEUTENANT,
WHAT DO WE GOT?

07:30.718 --> 07:32.219
UH, YOU NEED
TO TALK TO TAO.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.954
HE'S THE INCIDENT
COMMANDER.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.123
SIR, I HAVE
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ

07:36.156 --> 07:39.593
IN AN AIR UNIT
SEARCHING THE AREA.

07:39.627 --> 07:40.728
TO CANVASS
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.731
WE'RE SENDING OUT
DETECTIVES

07:43.764 --> 07:46.099
AND LIEUTENANT FLYNN
AND DETECTIVE GABRIEL

07:46.133 --> 07:48.001
ARE DEALING
WITH THE PARENTS.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.703
SPEAKING OF THE PARENTS,
AT WHAT POINT DO YOU SUGGEST

07:49.737 --> 07:54.608
WE LET THE PRESS IN
ON THIS?

07:54.642 --> 07:56.910
WELL, I SUPPOSE WE
COULD LET THE PARENTS
TALK TO THE REPORTERS,

07:56.944 --> 07:59.780
BUT THEY'RE DIVORCED.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.182
REFEREEING A SHOUTING MATCH
BETWEEN ERIC'S MOM AND DAD.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.217
WHAT ARE THEY
SHOUTING ABOUT?

08:04.251 --> 08:06.119
UH, IT'S A LONG STORY,
BUT APPARENTLY THE --

08:06.153 --> 08:08.822
MR. LYNCH BLAMES MRS. LYNCH
FOR NOT BRINGING ERIC TO CAMP.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.561
UH, CHIEF POPE,
THIS IS MY SON KEVIN.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.862
HE'S A VOLUNTEER
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER,

08:14.895 --> 08:17.698
ONE OF ERIC'S
CAMP COUNSELORS.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.132
WELL...

08:19.166 --> 08:20.734
GOOD WORK, KEVIN.

08:20.768 --> 08:21.969
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.674
ALL RIGHT, LIEUTENANT,
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

08:42.790 --> 08:44.625
Hey, back the other way!
Back! Back! Go back!

08:44.658 --> 08:47.895
PILOT:
Yeah, I got it back there.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.329
SANCHEZ:
All units, be advised --

08:49.362 --> 08:54.134
I got a body in a pool

08:54.167 --> 08:58.205
third house down.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.974
PILOT: No, no, no.
That's not good.

09:20.127 --> 09:23.230
[ HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING,
DOG BARKING ]

09:39.780 --> 09:41.915
SORRY, MIKE.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.188
AH, DAMN IT.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.637
OKAY, BUZZ, THAT'S ENOUGH.

10:03.671 --> 10:06.239
ACCORDING TO KENDALL'S
PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION,

10:06.273 --> 10:09.076
ERIC LYNCH HAD BEEN DEAD
BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE HOURS

10:09.109 --> 10:10.811
WHEN WE FOUND HIM.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.081
NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF ABUSE.
NO BRUISES, SCRATCHES.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.818
AND NO ONE WE'VE TALKED
TO SO FAR SAW ERIC GET
INTO A CAR OR WALKING.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.155
AND THE OWNERS OF THE HOUSE
WHERE WE FOUND THIS BOY?

10:22.189 --> 10:24.091
THEY WERE UPSIDE-DOWN
ON THEIR MORTGAGE --

10:24.124 --> 10:25.358
STOPPED MAKING PAYMENTS
A WHILE AGO

10:25.392 --> 10:27.360
AND THEN MOVED
BACK TO SACRAMENTO.

10:27.394 --> 10:31.865
TECHNICALLY,
THE PROPERTY'S ABANDONED.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.702
Brenda:
HOW DOES A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY

10:34.735 --> 10:36.970
END UP IN A SWIMMING POOL
OF AN ABANDONED HOUSE

10:37.004 --> 10:38.672
A MILE AWAY FROM HIS BICYCLE?

10:38.706 --> 10:40.373
I DON'T KNOW.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.375
I-IT'D BE ONE THING
IF HIS BODY SHOWED

10:42.409 --> 10:44.745
DEFENSIVE WOUNDS
OR EVEN A BUMP ON THE HEAD,

10:44.778 --> 10:46.346
BUT THERE WASN'T A MARK
ON HIM.

10:48.849 --> 10:52.319
UM, KEVIN, IS THERE A POOL
AT THIS SUMMER CAMP?

10:52.352 --> 10:53.954
Kevin: YEAH.
I MEAN, YES, MA'AM.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.089
UM, THERE'S ONE
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY THAT WE USE,

10:56.123 --> 10:57.958
AND ERIC SWAM REALLY WELL
FOR A KID.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.229
ALL RIGHT, THEN. WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP TODAY.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.733
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER,
THEN.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.736
MY WIFE IS COMING
TO PICK HIM UP PRETTY SOON.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.238
MY PARENTS WON'T LET ME GET
MY DRIVER'S LICENSE, SO...

11:11.271 --> 11:13.140
WELL, JUST TILL HE GETS
HIS GRADES UP A BIT.
MY GRADES AREN'T BAD, DAD.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.843
YOU NEED TO PREPARE FOR YOUR
S.A.T.s, AND THAT'S IT! OKAY?

11:18.045 --> 11:20.180
MY WIFE WILL BE HERE...

11:20.213 --> 11:21.782
EVENTUALLY.
Brenda: ALL RIGHT.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.984
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.919
MAKE YOURSELF...AT HOME...

11:26.954 --> 11:31.358
...KEVIN.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.126
YES, MA'AM.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.366
I'M NOT SURE
YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.269
WHY?
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

11:42.302 --> 11:46.139
CHIEF JOHNSON HAS TO NOTIFY
ERIC'S PARENTS THAT...

11:46.173 --> 11:50.410
HE'S DEAD.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.480
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WAITING.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.948
I KNOW
YOU MUST BE FRUSTRATED.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.449
I'VE JUST GOT
A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.451
YOU DRAG ME HERE,
THROW ME IN A ROOM,

11:58.485 --> 12:00.153
TELL ME MY RIGHTS --

12:00.187 --> 12:02.489
WELL, IT'S JUST
GOVERNMENT FORMALITY, SIR.

12:02.522 --> 12:06.093
WE MIRANDIZED YOUR EX-WIFE
AND HER BOYFRIEND, TOO.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.962
ANYTIME WE HAVE TO
SPEAK TO SOMEONE IN
A CASE LIKE THIS, WE --

12:08.996 --> 12:12.165
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
TO FIND MY SON.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.935
DOES ANYBODY KNOW ANYTHING?
WHERE'S MY SON?!

12:14.968 --> 12:18.538
SIR, PLEASE UNDERSTAND,
OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS ERIC.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.540
BUT IN ORDER
FOR US TO PROCEED,

12:20.573 --> 12:22.009
I NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

12:22.042 --> 12:25.012
OKAY?
SO, WILL YOU HELP ME?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.546
PLEASE,
WILL YOU HELP ME?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.881
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.124
YOU AND YOUR WIFE
ARE DIVORCED,

12:37.157 --> 12:38.926
AND SHE HAS PRIMARY CUSTODY
OF ERIC.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.560
IS THAT CORRECT?
OF COURSE IT'S CORRECT.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.230
IF I HAD PRIMARY CUSTODY,
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.364
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.466
HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE ERIC?

12:46.499 --> 12:49.236
TWO WEEKENDS A MONTH...

12:49.269 --> 12:51.939
CHRISTMAS,
OR THANKSGIVING.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.373
TELL MR. LYNCH
THAT ERIC'S DEAD.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.408
WHY IS SHE ASKING
ALL THOSE QUESTIONS?

12:55.442 --> 12:58.078
IT'S SO HARD TO HAVE
YOUR LIFE AND YOUR CHILD

12:58.111 --> 13:00.480
TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU
AT THE SAME TIME...

13:00.513 --> 13:03.516
IF ERIC TURNS OUT
TO HAVE BEEN MURDERED,

13:03.550 --> 13:06.153
WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE
EVERYONE WE CAN AS A SUSPECT.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.022
A SUSPECT?
BUT THAT'S ERIC'S DAD.

13:09.056 --> 13:13.060
MM-HMM.
AND I'VE TRIED
OVER AND OVER...

13:13.093 --> 13:14.394
YES.

13:14.427 --> 13:18.531
WHY DON'T YOU SEE
IF YOU CAN GET

13:18.565 --> 13:21.368
Glen:
TINA SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN
A WIFE, MUCH LESS A MOTHER.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.104
NEVER, EVER, EVER. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING!

13:24.137 --> 13:25.839
SIR, WHERE WERE YOU
THIS MORNING

13:25.873 --> 13:27.274
WHEN ERIC WOULD HAVE BEEN
GOING TO CAMP?

13:28.375 --> 13:32.980
ON MY WAY TO WORK.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.015
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
I LIVE ON THE WEST SIDE.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.885
I WEAR A SIZE-12 SHOE.
I'M A CONTROLLER AT A BANK.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.921
WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH FINDING MY SON?!

13:44.457 --> 13:46.193
MR. LYNCH, I'M SO SORRY,

13:46.226 --> 13:49.229
BUT AT 4:30 THIS AFTERNOON,
OFFICERS FOUND YOUR SON

13:49.262 --> 13:52.399
IN A POOL ABOUT A MILE
AWAY FROM HIS SUMMER CAMP.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.634
UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAS DEAD
WHEN WE ARRIVED.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.037
I'M -- I'M SO SORRY.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.975
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.980
YOU'RE LYING.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.416
I WISH I WERE.

14:14.054 --> 14:17.157
HOW COULD SHE JUST LET HIM
RIDE OFF ON HIS OWN LIKE THAT?!

14:17.190 --> 14:20.427
SHE REFUSED TO LET ME
HAVE CUSTODY.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.930
AND THEN SHE REFUSED
TO LOOK AFTER HIM!

14:24.297 --> 14:25.398
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT!

14:25.432 --> 14:27.067
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?!

14:30.170 --> 14:31.638
KEVIN,
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU --

14:31.671 --> 14:33.473
Kevin: DAD,
YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING

14:33.506 --> 14:36.209
LIKE I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
TO HOW BAD THE WORLD CAN BE.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.078
AND I KNEW ERIC.
HE WAS --
ENOUGH.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.613
GO WITH UNCLE BUZZ
TO THE BREAK ROOM.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.483
HE'LL GET YOU SOMETHING.
THEN YOU CAN SIT AT MY DESK.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.485
CALCULUS, S.A.T.s.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.520
OKAY?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.957
Glen:
ERIC CAN'T BE DEAD.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.626
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.202
YEAH.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.571
NEVER GETS ANY EASIER,
DOES IT?

15:04.604 --> 15:06.339
UM, I'LL ASK
BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE

15:06.373 --> 15:08.475
TO SEND UP A COUPLE
OF GRIEF COUNSELORS.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.177
HOPEFULLY
IT WON'T TAKE FOREVER.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.248
Taylor:
UH, CHIEF JOHNSON?

15:15.282 --> 15:17.250
UH, YES, COMMANDER,
WHAT IS IT?

15:17.284 --> 15:19.252
ANY WORD
ON KNOWN CHILD MOLESTERS?

15:19.286 --> 15:23.190
THAT LOOKS LIKE
A DEAD END.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.458
WONDERING WHEN WE'LL ISSUE
A STATEMENT ON THE BOY.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.027
WHAT?!

15:27.060 --> 15:29.529
HOW DID THE MEDIA FIND OUT

15:29.562 --> 15:31.198
WE ISSUED A CODE 20,

15:31.231 --> 15:34.167
USED THE MEDIA TO KEEP
THE BOY'S FACE OUT THERE.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.568
OH, RIGHT.
CODE 20. OF COURSE.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.237
THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.540
SO, UH,
HOW DO I PROCEED?

15:40.573 --> 15:43.143
PLEASE TELL OUR REPORTER FRIENDS
THAT, PENDING AN AUTOPSY,

15:43.176 --> 15:45.045
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW ERIC LYNCH DIED,

15:45.078 --> 15:46.413
AND WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

15:46.446 --> 15:48.348
HOW HE ENDED UP
FLOATING IN A SWIMMING POOL

15:48.381 --> 15:50.317
SO FAR AWAY FROM HIS HOUSE
AND HIS BICYCLE.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.052
CHIEF JOHNSON.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.353
I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.288
EXCUSE ME.
THANK YOU, COMMANDER.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.756
HOW DID YOUR MEETING GO
WITH CAPTAIN RAYDOR?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.059
WELL, WE DIDN'T FINISH,

15:59.092 --> 16:01.128
BUT SO FAR
SHE HASN'T ARRESTED ME.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.596
WOW. YOU'RE SETTING YOUR
EXPECTATIONS THAT LOW

16:03.630 --> 16:06.499
SHE'S ALREADY WRAPPED IT
UP WITH EVERYBODY ELSE IN
YOUR DIVISION AND TAYLOR.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.768
WELL, I'M SLAPDAB IN THE MIDDLE
OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

16:08.801 --> 16:12.239
WHO KILLED
A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY.

16:12.272 --> 16:16.309
NO.
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.711
EVENTUALLY, YES.
JUST NOT RIGHT NOW.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.082
OKAY.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.253
Tina: DO YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER

16:26.286 --> 16:27.487
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BE HERE?

16:27.520 --> 16:31.091
I JUST, UH...

16:31.124 --> 16:33.060
Flynn: WE HAVE PATROL CARS
AT YOUR HOME, MA'AM.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.461
WE'LL BE NOTIFIED
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.063
OHH!

16:36.096 --> 16:37.297
DID YOU FIND HIM?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.731
DID YOU FIND
MY BABY BOY?

16:38.765 --> 16:40.667
MRS. LYNCH,
I'M SO SORRY.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.803
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN,
I PROMISE YOU.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.439
WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I ASKED YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS?

16:46.473 --> 16:47.574
UH, YEAH.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.176
ASK ME ANYTHING.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.010
OKAY.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?

16:53.746 --> 16:56.383
DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD

16:56.416 --> 16:58.618
THIS MORNING OR RECENTLY

16:58.651 --> 17:00.720
WHO SEEMED ODD
OR OUT OF PLACE?

17:02.222 --> 17:04.624
UH, NO. NOT --
NOT THAT I CAN RECALL.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.161
DID ERIC MAKE ANY NEW FRIENDS
RECENTLY?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.298
I-I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN...

17:11.331 --> 17:13.100
I DON'T THINK SO.
NOT THAT HE SAID.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.302
AND WHERE WERE YOU
THIS MORNING,

17:15.335 --> 17:17.170
WHEN ERIC WAS ON HIS WAY
TO CAMP?

17:21.341 --> 17:24.344
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.848
IF I HAD, WE WOULDN'T
BE SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.220
BUT HE WANTED
TO RIDE HIS BIKE.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.455
AND GLEN IS THE ONE
WHO GAVE HIM THAT BIKE

17:35.488 --> 17:37.624
AND THEN TERRORIZED HIM
ABOUT USING IT PROPERLY.

17:37.657 --> 17:42.061
AND I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
GIVEN IN ON THAT BIKE.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.666
BUT, UM...

17:46.699 --> 17:49.702
ERIC LOVED IT, AND...

17:52.572 --> 17:54.507
A LITTLE WHILE
AFTER HE LEFT FOR CAMP,

17:54.541 --> 17:56.509
I GOT THE CAR,
UH, DETAILED.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.510
WHERE?

17:57.544 --> 17:59.779
UH, CORBIN WAX AND SHINE.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.648
IT'S JUST A FEW BLOCKS
FROM THE HOUSE.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.516
Gabriel: SO, THE DAY
HER SON GOES MISSING,

18:03.550 --> 18:05.718
SHE SAYS SHE'S HAVING
HER CAR DETAILED.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.854
Tina: I WENT TO THE GYM
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.189
DOES THAT BOTHER YOU?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.557
I SPOKE TO A FRIEND...

18:10.590 --> 18:13.560
DO A CHECK
ON THE CAR WASH,

18:13.593 --> 18:17.497
ALL RIGHT,
AND IF SHE IS,

18:17.530 --> 18:20.367
OH, AND DRAG
MR. LYNCH'S CREDIT CARDS,

18:20.400 --> 18:22.335
SEE IF THERE'S A CHARGE FOR GAS
ON HIS WAY TO THE OFFICE,

18:22.369 --> 18:23.870
AND SEE IF HE SHOWED UP FOR WORK
THIS MORNING.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.539
Flynn:
...SPEND A LOT OF TIME ONLINE?

18:31.411 --> 18:33.280
LIEUTENANT TAO,
WHERE'S MR. LYNCH?

18:33.313 --> 18:34.614
Tina: I DON'T KNOW.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.150
I MEAN,
I GUESS HE COULD HAVE...

18:37.184 --> 18:39.619
GOTTEN UP AT NIGHT WHEN
I WASN'T LOOKING, BUT, UM...

18:39.652 --> 18:42.255
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
ERIC'S DAD, HE WENT THAT WAY.

18:57.904 --> 19:01.341
Tina:
HE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE...

19:01.374 --> 19:03.510
HE'S ONLY 9 YEARS OLD.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.884
DOES SHE KNOW?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.620
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?
YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO --

19:13.653 --> 19:15.955
ERIC'S DEAD!
OUR SON IS DEAD!
NO.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.657
THEY FOUND HIM
IN A POOL!

19:17.690 --> 19:19.426
NO! NOT MY BABY!

19:19.459 --> 19:21.428
SHE KILLED MY SON!
GET HIM OUT OF HERE NOW!

19:21.461 --> 19:22.762
YOU WERE COMPLAINING
ABOUT HOW YOU AND MARC

19:22.795 --> 19:23.963
NEVER HAVE
ENOUGH TIME ALONE.
NO!

19:23.996 --> 19:25.598
NOW YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME
YOU WANT!

19:25.632 --> 19:26.866
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

19:26.899 --> 19:29.669
MARC, STAY HERE!
STAY HERE!

19:29.702 --> 19:31.438
Glen:
SHE KILLED MY SON!

19:31.471 --> 19:32.539
THAT BITCH KILLED MY SON!

19:32.572 --> 19:35.942
NO!
NOT MY BABY BOY!

19:35.975 --> 19:37.510
AND YOU!

19:37.544 --> 19:38.611
YOU.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.779
YOU LIVE IN MY HOUSE.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.381
YOU SCREW MY WIFE.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.316
YOU'RE AS MUCH TO BLAME
AS SHE IS!

19:45.952 --> 19:46.853
UGH!

19:46.886 --> 19:47.887
ENOUGH!

19:50.723 --> 19:52.559
GO TO THE BREAK ROOM,

19:52.592 --> 19:54.661
GET YOURSELF A SNACK,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.763
AND WATCH SOME TV, OKAY?

19:56.796 --> 19:58.231
YEAH. OKAY.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.581
DOCTOR?

20:14.614 --> 20:19.919
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

20:19.952 --> 20:25.392
OKAY.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.960
NO BRUISING,
NO SIGNS OF PETECHIAE,

20:27.994 --> 20:32.965
NOTHING THAT POINTS

20:32.999 --> 20:34.367
THAT'S THE BEST I GOT.

20:35.502 --> 20:36.836
AND THE WORST?

20:39.372 --> 20:41.574
NO FOAM
IN THE BOY'S LUNGS.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.343
FOAM?

20:43.376 --> 20:46.613
WHEN SOMEONE DROWNS,

20:46.646 --> 20:48.281
AND AS THE VICTIM
GASPS FOR AIR,

20:48.315 --> 20:51.618
THE WATER-MUCUS MIXTURE CHURNS,
CREATING A FOAM.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.020
I SEE.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.923
THE BOY'S LUNGS
HAD NO FOAM.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.459
SO HE DIDN'T DROWN.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.694
NO. HE DIDN'T.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.063
THEN, HOW DID HE DIE?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.733
MY GUESS
WOULD BE OVERSEDATION.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.569
ADMINISTERED HOW?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.504
WHEN I SEARCHED THE CONTENTS
OF HIS STOMACH,

21:11.538 --> 21:13.940
ALL I COULD FIND WAS
PARTIALLY DIGESTED CHOCOLATE

21:13.973 --> 21:16.476
AND SOME SORT
OF BRIGHT-PURPLE FLUID.

21:16.509 --> 21:20.413
SO, WHAT, H-HE DRANK
SOME KIND OF A...

21:20.447 --> 21:23.550
SPORTS DRINK OR JUICE
WITH DRUGS DISSOLVED IN IT?

21:25.084 --> 21:26.753
YEAH.

21:26.786 --> 21:31.023
PROBABLY.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.794
I WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU
WHICH DRUGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.028
UNLESS...

21:36.062 --> 21:37.797
UNLESS...?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.832
UNLESS YOU HAVE
A POTENTIAL SUSPECT.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.668
THEN YOU COULD WRITE UP
A SEARCH WARRANT

21:41.701 --> 21:48.475
AND SEE IF ANYONE HAD

21:48.508 --> 21:50.477
JUST SO YOU KNOW...

21:50.510 --> 21:52.712
I HAVEN'T PUT HIM
BACK TOGETHER YET.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.415
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
IN THERE YOU WANT TO SEE.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.919
PROBABLY RIGHT.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.656
Gabriel:
VICODIN AND SOMA.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.393
ONE'S A NARCOTIC,
ONE'S A MUSCLE RELAXER.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.660
GIVEN IN HIGH-ENOUGH DOSES,

22:07.694 --> 22:09.061
THEY COULD DEFINITELY
BE LETHAL.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.597
OKAY,
LET'S CALL DR. MORALES

22:10.630 --> 22:12.865
AND SEE IF THIS IS WHAT
COULD HAVE KILLED ERIC.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.034
AND WHERE IN MRS. LYNCH'S HOUSE
DID YOU FIND THEM?

22:15.067 --> 22:17.437
UH, IN HER MEDICINE CABINET,
BUT THE NAME ON THE PRESCRIPTION

22:17.470 --> 22:19.071
IS HER BOYFRIEND'S,
A MARCUS WINSLOW.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.374
AND GET THIS --
UNLIKE MR. AND MRS. LYNCH,

22:21.408 --> 22:22.709
HE HAS NO ALIBI
FOR THIS MORNING.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.444
AND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH,
CHIEF,

22:24.477 --> 22:26.446
WE SEARCHED OUR
YOGA INSTRUCTOR'S PLACE.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.014
I THOUGHT HE LIVED
WITH MRS. LYNCH.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.949
WELL, IT TURNS OUT
MARC KEEPS A LITTLE CONDO

22:29.982 --> 22:32.519
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.954
IN ADDITION TO MATS, BEADS,
AND CRYSTALS...

22:34.987 --> 22:37.023
A UNIFORM FROM THE LAS VEGAS
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

22:37.056 --> 22:40.660
NOW, WHY WOULD MR. WINSLOW
HAVE THAT?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.929
Fritz:
HE USED TO BE A COP THERE.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.532
WINSLOW HAD ALMOST A DECADE
ON THE L.V.P.D.

22:45.565 --> 22:50.637
BEFORE RESIGNING...

22:50.670 --> 22:52.405
OH. WHAT KIND
OF PERSONAL REASONS?

22:52.439 --> 22:54.006
TWO DOMESTIC-ABUSE
ACCUSATIONS.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.809
HIS EX-WIFE
NEVER OFFICIALLY FILED.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.078
AND INSTEAD OF SUBMITTING
TO AN INVESTIGATION,

22:59.111 --> 23:01.548
WINSLOW CHOSE TO SEE
A PSYCHOLOGIST

23:01.581 --> 23:02.749
FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT...

23:02.782 --> 23:04.083
AND RESIGN.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.718
OOPH. RESIGN.

23:05.752 --> 23:06.853
CAN'T BLAME HIM FOR THAT.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.458
ROUGH DAY?

23:11.491 --> 23:13.593
CAPTAIN RAYDOR'S AUDIT

23:13.626 --> 23:16.429
IS MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ME TO DO MY JOB.

23:16.463 --> 23:18.631
I COULDN'T EVEN GO
TO THE CRIME SCENE TODAY.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.767
AND YOU REALLY MISSED
BEING THERE...

23:20.800 --> 23:22.469
WHEN THEY FOUND THAT BOY
IN THE POOL.

23:23.770 --> 23:24.737
SERIOUSLY?

23:24.771 --> 23:26.573
WHAT I'M MISSING IS MOTIVE.

23:26.606 --> 23:27.940
WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS?

23:27.974 --> 23:29.942
A MAN STARTS DATING
A WOMAN...

23:29.976 --> 23:32.545
WOMAN HAS A CHILD
FROM A PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP...

23:32.579 --> 23:35.047
SUDDENLY THE CHILD IS GONE.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.683
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.122
UH, JUST HEARD BACK
FROM DR. MORALES.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.957
ERIC'S STOMACH CONTENTS
CAME BACK POSITIVE

23:44.991 --> 23:46.726
FOR BOTH VICODIN AND SOMA.

23:49.496 --> 23:52.965
I BELIEVE THESE ARE YOURS,
MR. WINSLOW.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.501
IS THAT CORRECT?

23:55.568 --> 23:57.970
I TAKE THOSE FOR A BACK INJURY
I GOT AT WORK.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.172
WHAT, YOU HAD
A YOGA ACCIDENT?

24:00.206 --> 24:02.174
YEAH. BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

24:02.208 --> 24:04.110
I PUSHED MYSELF TOO FAR
AND ENDED UP GETTING HURT.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.678
I SOMETIMES TAKE THESE
FOR THE PAIN.

24:05.712 --> 24:08.815
W-WHY DO YOU --
WHY DO YOU CARE?

24:08.848 --> 24:10.717
WE FOUND
IN ERIC'S STOMACH.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.220
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE DROWNED.
NO.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.590
ERIC DIED OF AN OVERDOSE
OF VICODIN AND SOMA

24:17.624 --> 24:19.592
BEFORE HE WAS DUMPED
IN THE POOL.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.594
AND YOU THINK
I GAVE THEM TO HIM.

24:21.628 --> 24:22.962
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME
YOU WERE ACCUSED

24:22.995 --> 24:24.531
OF HURTING SOMEONE
YOU WERE LIVING WITH.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.136
SHE DROPPED THOSE CHARGES.
DIDN'T STOP YOU
FROM RESIGNING

24:30.169 --> 24:34.040
FROM THE POLICE FORCE,
THOUGH, DID IT?

24:34.073 --> 24:36.909
AGAINST ME
AND THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS.

24:36.943 --> 24:39.879
SO INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH
ALL THAT POLITICAL BULLSHIT,

24:39.912 --> 24:41.213
I JUST WALKED AWAY.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.815
DIRECTLY
INTO ANGER MANAGEMENT.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.953
I WAS MAD. YEAH.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.923
BUT I RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM
AND TOOK CARE OF IT.

24:50.957 --> 24:53.993
AND I FOUND AN OUTLET FOR...

24:54.026 --> 24:55.628
MY NEGATIVE EMOTIONS.

24:55.662 --> 24:59.265
LIKE HOW YOU USED
MR. LYNCH

24:59.298 --> 25:06.105
HE ATTACKED ME.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.775
BECAUSE HE THINKS
I HAD ISSUES WITH ERIC.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.009
WHY?

25:11.210 --> 25:13.680
BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST STARTED
GOING OUT WITH HER,

25:13.713 --> 25:16.683
I TOLD TINA...

25:16.716 --> 25:19.051
I WASN'T WILD ABOUT KIDS.
AND THAT WASN'T THE CASE?

25:20.587 --> 25:21.788
WOW.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.657
NO.
CALCULUS?

25:24.691 --> 25:25.658
DID IT.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.026
HISTORY?
DIDN'T BRING IT.

25:27.059 --> 25:30.329
I'LL BE QUIET.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.732
I KNOW HOW BAD IT SOUNDS.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.266
I DIDN'T MIND
MOVING IN WITH TINA,

25:34.300 --> 25:36.135
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED AGAIN.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.671
AND WOMEN HER AGE, THEY, LIKE,
TO START PUSHING FOR A RING

25:38.705 --> 25:44.811
ON THE SECOND DATE.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.714
...I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE A PARENT.

25:47.747 --> 25:51.651
I'M SURE GLEN TOLD YOU HOW HARD
HE FOUGHT FOR PRIMARY CUSTODY

25:51.684 --> 25:53.753
AFTER TINA AND I STARTED
SEEING EACH OTHER,

25:53.786 --> 25:55.221
SAYING THAT ERIC
WAS GROWING UP

25:55.254 --> 25:57.924
IN AN AMORAL ENVIRONMENT,
RIGHT?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.826
BUT I WAS MORE OF A FATHER
TO THAT KID

25:59.859 --> 26:01.360
THAN GLEN EVER KNEW
HOW TO BE!

26:01.393 --> 26:03.696
WHEN I ASKED YOU TO HELP US
FIND ERIC THIS MORNING,

26:03.730 --> 26:05.364
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO KEEP OUT OF IT.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.934
DID YOU NOT SEE WHAT
HAPPENED WHEN THE THREE
OF US WERE TOGETHER?

26:09.035 --> 26:12.705
BESIDES,
THERE ARE SOME FAMILY THINGS

26:12.739 --> 26:15.742
THAT I HAVE LEARNED
TO STAY OUT OF,

26:15.775 --> 26:17.877
AND TINA IS NOT...

26:17.910 --> 26:22.181
SHE'S NOT MY WIFE.

26:22.214 --> 26:25.184
NO. AS IT TURNS OUT,
SHE WASN'T INTERESTED IN THAT.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.186
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

26:29.689 --> 26:31.758
BECAUSE I PROPOSED TO HER.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.963
AND SHE REFUSED?

26:36.996 --> 26:39.365
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW

26:39.398 --> 26:42.334
HOW YOU FOUND THIS STUFF
IN ERIC'S STOMACH.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.970
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HIM.

26:44.003 --> 26:47.139
I SWEAR IT.
I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HIM.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.880
EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.148
KEVIN?

26:56.182 --> 26:58.751
HI, MOM.

27:00.987 --> 27:05.257
WHAT'S HE DOING IN HERE?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.259
MOM, I WANTED
TO HELP OUT.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.995
KEVIN'S NOT OLD ENOUGH

27:09.028 --> 27:10.663
TO BE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A MURDER INVESTIGATION,

27:10.697 --> 27:12.765
ESPECIALLY OF SOMEBODY
THAT HE KNOWS.

27:12.799 --> 27:16.368
GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER,
PLEASE.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.942
THIS IS REALLY BETTER

27:22.975 --> 27:24.677
THAN LETTING HIM GET
HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE?

27:29.882 --> 27:33.452
SINCE MR. LYNCH WAS SO UNHAPPY
WITH HIS DIVORCE SETTLEMENT,

27:33.485 --> 27:35.021
I WONDER
IF HE'D LET US READ IT

27:35.054 --> 27:36.689
BEFORE I QUESTION
HIS EX-WIFE AGAIN.

27:36.723 --> 27:37.790
I'M ON IT, CHIEF.

27:37.824 --> 27:41.160
THANK YOU.

27:41.193 --> 27:44.330
Mrs. Tao:
HE WORKS HARD, MIKE.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.298
I DON'T CARE IF HE GOES
TO STANFORD.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.334
HE'S 16, MIKE,
AND A GOOD BOY.

27:48.367 --> 27:51.904
HE DESERVES A LITTLE FREEDOM.
LET HIM HAVE HIS LICENSE.

27:51.938 --> 27:54.073
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE PREPARING
FOR HIS S.A.T.s.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.844
I THOUGHT WE AGREED.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.980
TO WHAT?! YOU THINK I'LL DRIVE
OFF AND NEVER COME BACK?

28:01.013 --> 28:04.851
THAT YOU'LL LET ME GET
MY LICENSE,

28:04.884 --> 28:06.152
I'M 16 YEARS OLD, DAD,

28:06.185 --> 28:09.021
AND YOU STILL TREAT ME
LIKE I'M A LITTLE KID.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.290
IT'S NOT ABOUT MY GRADES
OR THE S.A.T.s.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.259
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROTECT ME FROM...

28:13.292 --> 28:15.294
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

28:15.327 --> 28:18.998
BUT YOU CAN'T HOLD ON TO ME
FOREVER. YOU JUST CAN'T.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.867
YES, I CAN.

28:24.971 --> 28:28.808
I'LL BE HOLDING ON TO YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.541
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE
ALL NIGHT?

29:02.574 --> 29:06.412
UM...

29:06.445 --> 29:08.848
I HAVE SEARCH WARRANTS OUT,
SO I'M WAITING.

29:08.881 --> 29:11.117
SEARCH WARRANTS.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

29:11.150 --> 29:13.052
ITEMS WE FOUND
IN THE VICTIM'S STOMACH.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.154
I THOUGHT DR. MORALES IDENTIFIED
THOSE DRUGS FOR YOU...

29:15.187 --> 29:18.925
HE DID.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.092
WE HAVE.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.562
LISTEN, IS THIS SOMETHING THAT
WE NEED TO DISCUSS RIGHT NOW,

29:23.595 --> 29:24.964
OR CAN IT WAIT
TILL I'M DONE?

29:24.997 --> 29:26.465
HAVE YOU GIVEN
ANY MORE THOUGHT

29:26.498 --> 29:28.835
TO THE IDEA
OF HIRING AN ATTORNEY?

29:28.868 --> 29:31.237
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.872
I'LL TELL YOU AGAIN.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.473
I ASKED TURELL BAYLOR
WHERE HE WANTED TO GO.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.543
HE SAID, "HOME." I TOOK HIM
THERE, AND I LEFT. THE END.

29:37.576 --> 29:40.246
SO YOUR POSITION
BOILS DOWN TO THIS --

29:40.279 --> 29:42.448
THE SUSPECT WAS ONLY
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

29:42.481 --> 29:46.986
WHILE IN CUSTODY.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.821
IS THAT RIGHT?

29:51.090 --> 29:54.593
Provenza:
DAMNDEST THING I EVER SAW,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR SURE.

29:54.626 --> 29:58.230
YEAH.  NOW, I KNOW
MY WAY AROUND A DIVORCE.

29:58.264 --> 30:01.968
THERE'S BAD, THERE'S UGLY,
AND THEN THERE'S THIS.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.170
Flynn: OKAY, TINA LYNCH
NOT ONLY TOOK HER HUSBAND

30:04.203 --> 30:07.539
FOR EVERYTHING HE HAD --

30:07.573 --> 30:09.976
SHE'S ALSO TAKING HIM
FOR CLOSE TO 2/3

30:10.009 --> 30:12.611
OF EVERYTHING HE WILL HAVE
OVER THE NEXT NINE YEARS.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.614
BUT MR. LYNCH'S MAIN CONCERN
THROUGHOUT

30:15.647 --> 30:18.017
WAS GAINING PRIMARY CUSTODY
OF HIS SON.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.252
IN THE THREE YEARS
SINCE HIS DIVORCE,

30:20.286 --> 30:24.056
HE'S FILED SIX MOTIONS TO GET
ERIC BACK FROM HIS EX-WIFE.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.458
YEAH, HE CLAIMS THAT
SHE'S "AN UNFIT MOTHER

30:26.492 --> 30:28.594
"WITH PROMISCUOUS TENDENCIES

30:28.627 --> 30:30.529
AND A LACK OF FINANCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY."

30:30.562 --> 30:33.966
Tao:
THIS IS THE HARD COPY

30:34.000 --> 30:35.267
IT'S THE SAME THING
THEY E-MAILED US.

30:35.301 --> 30:36.502
SO YOU WANT
TO WATCH IT AGAIN?

30:36.535 --> 30:39.605
NO.
THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.874
WHILE I TALK
TO THE MOTHER.

30:41.908 --> 30:45.945
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,

30:45.978 --> 30:46.979
I NEED TO GET THIS OVER WITH.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.514
AND, UH, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

30:48.547 --> 30:51.317
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I THINK MR. LYNCH DESERVES

30:51.350 --> 30:53.285
TO LISTEN TO THIS INTERVIEW.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.853
CHIEF, IN HERE?

30:57.189 --> 30:59.591
BETTER IN ELECTRONICS.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.928
THANK YOU.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.062
WE'LL HAVE TO
TALK LATER, CHIEF.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.931
I'M SURE WE WILL.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.433
FIRST, I WANT TO SEE
MY LITTLE BOY.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.402
WHEN CAN I SEE --

31:10.436 --> 31:13.072
WHEN CAN I SEE
MY SON'S BODY?

31:13.105 --> 31:14.473
SOON.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.442
JUST HAVE TO CLARIFY
A FEW THINGS.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.610
IN INVESTIGATING
YOUR SON'S DEATH,

31:18.644 --> 31:21.213
WE'VE BEEN EXAMINING
YOUR DIVORCE DECREE.

31:21.247 --> 31:24.250
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

31:24.283 --> 31:26.618
I'M NOT SO MUCH INTERESTED
IN THE END OF YOUR MARRIAGE

31:26.652 --> 31:30.122
AS I AM ABOUT THE CUSTODY FIGHT
OVER ERIC.

31:31.423 --> 31:34.626
Tina: I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT...

31:34.660 --> 31:37.529
CHIEF, MR. LYNCH
IS HERE OBSERVING.
Flynn: WELL, IN THE PAST
FEW YEARS, YOUR EX-HUSBAND

31:37.563 --> 31:41.167
HAS FILED SIX MOTIONS
FOR PRIMARY CUSTODY OF ERIC.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.035
THESE MOTIONS ALL HAVE
A COMMON THEME.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.938
IN EACH ONE,
YOUR EX-HUSBAND CLAIMS

31:45.972 --> 31:47.473
FOR ONE REASON
AFTER ANOTHER --

31:47.506 --> 31:49.508
PROMISCUITY,
LACK OF SUPERVISION,

31:49.541 --> 31:50.943
LIVING
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND --

31:50.977 --> 31:57.049
THAT YOU'RE
AN UNFIT MOTHER.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.418
I WOULD LIKE TO MARRY HIM,
BUT I WON'T.

31:59.451 --> 32:02.989
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHY SHE WON'T MARRY HIM. GOD!

32:03.022 --> 32:05.357
IF I GET REMARRIED, GLEN
NO LONGER HAS TO PAY ALIMONY,

32:05.391 --> 32:08.060
AND FOR 12 YEARS,
I PUT UP WITH HIS LYING,

32:08.094 --> 32:10.596
HIS CHEATING,
HIS EMOTIONAL ABUSE,

32:10.629 --> 32:14.967
AND HE WILL PAY ME EVERYTHING
HE OWES ME YEAR AFTER YEAR,

32:15.001 --> 32:18.037
AND I HOPE
THAT I GET EVERY CENT.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.973
MISERABLE. MISERABLE.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.742
Brenda: YOU HAVE HIS HOUSE.
YOU HAVE HIS CAR.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.078
WHY NOT GIVE HIM BACK
HIS SON?

32:26.112 --> 32:28.214
HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT HIS SON.

32:28.247 --> 32:31.750
HE CARES ABOUT THE CHECK

32:31.783 --> 32:34.420
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
HE DID BUY YOUR SON A BICYCLE.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.657
AND ERIC WANTED TO RIDE
THAT BIKE TO SUMMER CAMP.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.661
AND WHAT DID THAT
LEAD TO, HUH?

32:42.694 --> 32:45.531
HOW DID THAT END UP --
GLEN'S LITTLE GIFT?

32:48.734 --> 32:50.302
EXCUSE ME.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.147
IT ENDED UP WITH YOU NOT WALKING
YOUR SON TO CAMP.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.116
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
MRS. LYNCH?

33:06.452 --> 33:08.287
YES.

33:11.590 --> 33:15.261
I DIDN'T WALK HIM TO CAMP,
AND I SHOULD HAVE.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.729
IT IS MY FAULT ERIC IS DEAD,
AND I KNOW THAT.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.765
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S TAKING
RESPONSIBILITY, SIR.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.733
WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT
ONE MORE THING.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.269
BUZZ, YOU ALL CUED UP?

33:23.302 --> 33:26.772
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

33:26.805 --> 33:30.309
AND I AM SICK ABOUT IT. SICK.
BUT HE IS A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.045
SHE'S TRYING TO WEASEL
OUT OF THIS BY CRYING.
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

33:33.079 --> 33:34.780
I CAN'T HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL
OVER HIM,

33:34.813 --> 33:36.748
NO MATTER
WHAT GLEN THINKS.

33:42.388 --> 33:43.689
WHAT'S THIS?

33:43.722 --> 33:47.626
OH, THIS?

33:47.659 --> 33:50.096
ABOUT A HALF-HOUR
BEFORE YOUR SON WENT MISSING.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.597
Tao: YOU WENT
INTO THE MINI-MART

33:51.630 --> 33:53.399
TO PAY FOR YOUR GAS
WITH A CREDIT CARD...

33:53.432 --> 33:55.167
THEN YOU BOUGHT
A CHOCOLATE BAR

33:55.201 --> 33:57.203
AND A PURPLE SPORTS DRINK
WITH CASH.

33:59.338 --> 34:02.574
I BOUGHT A CANDY
AND A DRINK.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.810
SO WHAT?
SO THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND
IN ERIC'S STOMACH

34:04.843 --> 34:06.445
WHEN WE PERFORMED
THE AUTOPSY.

34:06.478 --> 34:09.415
WE ALSO FOUND A NARCOTIC
AND A MUSCLE RELAXER,

34:09.448 --> 34:11.183
WHICH YOU PROBABLY TOOK
FROM TINA'S BOYFRIEND

34:11.217 --> 34:12.751
WHEN NO ONE WAS HOME.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.353
WELL, IT USED TO BE
YOUR HOUSE, DIDN'T IT?

34:14.386 --> 34:17.523
ANYWAY, THERE WAS ENOUGH
MEDICATION IN ERIC'S BODY

34:17.556 --> 34:19.625
TO PUT A GROWN MAN
IN A COMA...

34:19.658 --> 34:21.760
OR KILL A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.296
ERIC DROWNED.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.532
DRUG HIM ENOUGH SO THAT WHEN HE
WAS PLACED IN THE SWIMMING POOL,

34:26.565 --> 34:29.401
HE WOULDN'T WAKE UP.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.437
SPEAKING OF POOLS...

34:31.470 --> 34:33.405
WHEN I CHECK
WITH THIS BANK WHERE YOU WORK,

34:33.439 --> 34:35.341
AM I GOING TO FIND
THAT THEY'RE REPOSSESSING

34:35.374 --> 34:36.808
THE HOUSE WHERE WE FOUND
YOUR SON'S BODY?

34:36.842 --> 34:38.844
SO WHAT IF THEY ARE?

34:38.877 --> 34:41.780
WELL, WHEN I CONSIDER THAT
AND I FACTOR IN THE BICYCLE,

34:41.813 --> 34:44.850
THIS BEGINS TO LOOK MORE AND
MORE LIKE A PREMEDITATED MURDER.

34:45.884 --> 34:50.622
WHAT DOES THE BIKE
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

34:50.656 --> 34:53.559
HIS BICYCLE WOULD HAVE BEEN
DROPPED TO THE GROUND.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.328
BUT IN THIS CASE,
ERIC'S BIKE WAS PARKED.

34:56.362 --> 34:59.231
Gabriel: WHICH MEANS HE DIDN'T
FEEL HE WAS IN ANY DANGER...

34:59.265 --> 35:02.668
WHICH MEANS HE GOT INTO
HIS ABDUCTOR'S CAR WILLINGLY.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.404
HE EVEN USED HIS KICKSTAND
TO PROP UP HIS BIKE.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.739
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.809
YOU TERRORIZED ERIC ABOUT
USING THAT BIKE RESPONSIBLY.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.745
AND YOU KNEW, DIDN'T YOU,
THAT ONCE HE HAD A BIKE

35:13.779 --> 35:16.415
THAT HE WOULD BEG HIS MOTHER
TO LET HIM RIDE IT TO CAMP

35:16.448 --> 35:18.217
AND THAT SHE WOULD GIVE IN

35:18.250 --> 35:20.419
AND LET HIM RIDE IT
OUT OF HER SIGHT...

35:20.452 --> 35:22.554
THAT FOR A FEW MINUTES
EVERY MORNING,

35:22.588 --> 35:25.324
ERIC WOULD BE FREE
AND UNSUPERVISED,

35:25.357 --> 35:27.393
AND SOMETHING TERRIBLE
COULD HAPPEN TO HIM.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.608
THIS IS ALL TINA'S FAULT.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.143
SHE TOOK EVERYTHING.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.879
MY HOUSE,
WHERE SHE LIVES...

35:47.913 --> 35:51.483
HAVING SEX
WITH ANOTHER MAN...

35:51.517 --> 35:53.685
MY CARS,
MOST OF MY SALARY.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.821
THE ONLY THING LEFT
WAS MY SON.

35:55.854 --> 35:59.691
AND THEN SHE TOOK HIM, TOO.
SHE POISONED ERIC AGAINST ME.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.427
SO YOU POISONED
YOUR OWN SON?

36:01.460 --> 36:03.662
HE WASN'T MY SON ANYMORE.
HE WAS HER SON.

36:03.695 --> 36:07.433
WHY SHOULD I PAY TO SUPPORT
SOME KID WHO HATES ME?

36:07.466 --> 36:09.568
TELL ME THAT, HUH?!

36:09.601 --> 36:12.771
NOW NEVER WILL A DAY GO BY

36:12.804 --> 36:16.442
WHERE SHE DOESN'T FEEL THE PAIN
OF LOSING HIM LIKE I DID.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.844
LET HER HAVE 2/3
OF WHAT I MAKE IN PRISON.

36:18.877 --> 36:21.580
MAYBE SHE AND HER BOYFRIEND
CAN TRY LIVING ON THAT!

36:21.613 --> 36:23.782
SO GO AHEAD! ARREST ME!

36:23.815 --> 36:30.289
SHE'S RUINED!

36:30.322 --> 36:31.557
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.292
MR. LYNCH,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

36:33.325 --> 36:34.793
FOR THE MURDER
OF YOUR SON, ERIC.

36:34.826 --> 36:35.961
TELL HER I DID THIS.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.696
TELL HER I DID THIS.
TELL HER.

36:37.729 --> 36:40.732
I WANT HER TO KNOW IT WAS ME
WHO TOOK HIM AWAY FROM HER!

36:40.766 --> 36:42.834
TELL HER! SHE'S RUINED!

36:42.868 --> 36:44.970
TELL HER I DID IT!

36:45.003 --> 36:46.605
TELL HER!

37:03.889 --> 37:06.892
LIEUTENANT,
Y-YOU DID GET HIM.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.662
YEAH.

37:30.516 --> 37:31.950
CHIEF JOHNSON?

37:34.019 --> 37:36.888
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF PROCESSING
MR. LYNCH'S BOOKING.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.890
I THINK LIEUTENANT TAO
KNEW HOW TO PROCESS BOOKING

37:38.924 --> 37:40.692
BEFORE YOU GOT HERE,

37:40.726 --> 37:42.894
AND HE WAS
THE INCIDENT COMMANDER.

37:45.564 --> 37:46.765
FINE.

37:49.568 --> 37:52.304
Raydor: UH, NOT THAT WAY,
PLEASE, CHIEF.

37:52.338 --> 37:53.439
GOING FOR A LITTLE RIDE.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.441
WHERE TO?
NOT FAR.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.942
LET'S GO, PLEASE.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.988
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:10.021 --> 38:11.890
WE'RE PROBABLY IN SOME SORT
OF TROUBLE.

38:11.923 --> 38:15.627
EH, WE'RE THE POLICE. WE'RE
ALWAYS IN SOME SORT OF TROUBLE.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.429
HERE.
HEY, KEV --

38:17.463 --> 38:19.398
HOLD ON A SEC.

38:21.567 --> 38:22.901
YOU COMPLETED THE BOOKING
ALREADY?

38:22.934 --> 38:24.603
YEAH.
FILLED IT OUT YESTERDAY.

38:24.636 --> 38:28.540
THIS SAYS "MARC WINSLOW."

38:28.574 --> 38:30.509
JUST CHANGE THE NAME
TO GLEN LYNCH.

38:30.542 --> 38:31.710
AND YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.514
OH, HEY, KEVIN.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.449
I WAS THINKING...

38:37.483 --> 38:39.117
WHAT IF I MADE YOU
AN APPOINTMENT

38:39.150 --> 38:41.620
FOR YOU TO TAKE A LITTLE TEST
AT THE DMV?

38:41.653 --> 38:43.689
THINK YOU CAN MANAGE --
KEVIN: Yes! Ha! Awesome!

38:43.722 --> 38:47.959
Dad, thank you!

38:47.993 --> 38:50.829
Dad, wait a minute.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.931
What do you think?
What do you think?!

39:06.778 --> 39:08.947
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS PLACE?

39:19.791 --> 39:21.427
TURELL BAYLOR'S HOUSE --

39:21.460 --> 39:24.830
WHERE YOU DELIVERED HIM,
UNPROTECTED, THE DAY HE DIED.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.999
IT'S WHERE TURELL SAID
HE WANTED TO GO.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.904
AND THAT MAY GET US
OUT OF CRIMINAL COURT,

39:32.938 --> 39:35.607
BUT IT MAY NOT WORK
IN YOUR FAVOR

39:35.641 --> 39:38.176
IN FRONT
OF A JURY OF CIVILIANS.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.579
COME WITH ME, PLEASE.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.091
COME ON.
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE ME HERE.

39:59.631 --> 40:00.966
WHAT'S UP
WITH MY PROTECTION?

40:00.999 --> 40:02.601
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
PROTECTING ME.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.503
PLEASE.

40:17.148 --> 40:20.619
SO, LET'S WALK
THROUGH IT.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.088
AFTER YOU DROPPED TURELL OFF,
LEAVING HIM ON HIS OWN,

40:23.121 --> 40:25.491
HE RAN INTO HIS HOUSE,
LOCKED THE DOOR,

40:25.524 --> 40:27.826
AND TRIED ESCAPING
THROUGH HIS BACKYARD HERE.

40:27.859 --> 40:29.761
BUT HE DIDN'T GET VERY FAR.
SEE?

40:29.795 --> 40:32.898
HE BROKE FREE
AND TRIED TO RUN,

40:32.931 --> 40:35.967
BUT HE WAS CAUGHT
OVER HERE.

40:36.001 --> 40:40.839
AND THEY DRAGGED HIM
ACROSS THIS DRIVEWAY...

40:42.541 --> 40:43.775
...TO THIS WALL,

40:43.809 --> 40:47.012
WHERE HIS HEAD
WAS SMASHED REPEATEDLY

40:47.045 --> 40:48.747
UNTIL HE WAS DEAD.

40:48.780 --> 40:52.484
YOU SAY THAT
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY ENDED

40:52.518 --> 40:54.953
THE MOMENT
TURELL LEFT YOUR CUSTODY,

40:54.986 --> 40:58.724
AND THE WARREN RULE FREES YOU
FROM CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

40:58.757 --> 41:03.061
BUT IN A CIVIL TRIAL,

41:03.094 --> 41:06.097
WITH A CALLOUS DISREGARD
TO THE SUSPECT'S LIFE,

41:06.131 --> 41:08.099
AND IF THE CITY ATTORNEY
STARTS TO THINK

41:08.133 --> 41:09.901
THAT HE IS LOSING
THIS CASE...

41:09.935 --> 41:11.803
HE COULD SETTLE.
...HE COULD SETTLE

41:11.837 --> 41:13.138
AND LEAVE YOU
TO TAKE THE BLAME,

41:13.171 --> 41:15.707
AND YOU WILL BE
ENTIRELY ON YOUR OWN.

41:21.947 --> 41:23.048
SO, WHAT SHOULD I DO?

41:23.081 --> 41:24.783
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE...

41:24.816 --> 41:27.485
GET YOUR OWN ATTORNEY.
