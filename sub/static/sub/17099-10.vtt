01:41.441 --> 01:43.433
Sir?

01:43.553 --> 01:46.963
- Are you alright?
- I'm sorry.

01:51.985 --> 01:54.374
He made me do it.

01:55.422 --> 01:57.542
Who?

02:00.843 --> 02:03.157
The Devil.

02:13.484 --> 02:15.427
Mr. Foley?

02:16.567 --> 02:19.149
How do you mean, the
Devil is inside you?

02:21.210 --> 02:23.453
I mean it like it is and it sounds.

02:23.912 --> 02:27.188
He came in through my chest one night.

02:28.006 --> 02:31.972
And now he lives in
my head like an insect.

02:32.242 --> 02:34.309
Telling me to do things...

02:34.979 --> 02:37.262
Terrible things.

02:38.850 --> 02:40.546
And why did you obey him?

02:41.161 --> 02:43.687
He said if I did as he
asked he would leave me.

02:43.807 --> 02:45.430
But he didn't.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.199
And just what did the Devil say to you?

02:49.246 --> 02:52.935
He told me that I would
be visited by two men.

02:53.266 --> 02:55.618
That I was to invite them in

02:57.360 --> 02:59.576
then cut their throats.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.225
He told me they were demons

03:03.035 --> 03:05.001
but I knew better.

03:07.156 --> 03:09.541
I should have killed myself instead.

03:10.325 --> 03:12.149
But I couldn't do it.

03:13.473 --> 03:15.270
I'm a coward.

03:15.912 --> 03:19.398
I'll have the constables
escort Mr. Foley to the asylum.

03:19.518 --> 03:21.452
Yes, I think that would be best.

03:21.572 --> 03:23.162
He's back.

03:24.101 --> 03:27.013
I don't know. I don't know.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.641
Mr. Foley?

03:29.202 --> 03:31.154
Is your name Julia?

03:32.324 --> 03:33.857
Yes.

03:33.884 --> 03:36.026
He knows you.

03:37.222 --> 03:39.641
- Is he talking to you right now?
- Yes.

03:39.655 --> 03:42.215
- What is he saying?
- Alight, alright! I will.

03:44.047 --> 03:46.553
He wants to talk to you.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.067
I can't hear him.

03:49.385 --> 03:51.919
Hello, Julia.

03:52.689 --> 03:55.418
How wonderful it is to see you again.

03:58.323 --> 04:01.268
I'm afraid I don't recall meeting you.

04:01.388 --> 04:04.519
Oh Julia, you wound me.

04:05.005 --> 04:07.234
Surely you remember me.

04:07.354 --> 04:09.551
I buried you alive.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.753
HELP!

04:16.043 --> 04:18.745
William. Help.

04:20.603 --> 04:22.617
James Gillies?

04:23.333 --> 04:25.583
Have you missed me?

04:31.860 --> 04:36.663
Mr. Foley claims to be possessed
by the spirit of James Gillies?

04:36.783 --> 04:39.163
Well, if he really believes
he's hearing his voice,

04:39.183 --> 04:40.730
he must be mad.

04:40.743 --> 04:43.331
That or he is passing
himself off as insane

04:43.365 --> 04:45.398
in order to avoid the noose.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.701
- Then why invoke Gillies?
- I don't know.

04:48.735 --> 04:52.518
To undermine our
investigation. Unnerve us.

04:52.572 --> 04:54.882
Well if that is his
intent, he will fail.

04:55.002 --> 04:57.119
- Sir.
- Henry?

04:57.768 --> 05:00.598
We've identified the victims
sir. We have Robert Wilcox,

05:00.645 --> 05:04.915
a farmer from Richmond Hill, and
Gerrard Berkeley, a machinist.

05:04.942 --> 05:06.799
He lived at Brunswick and Harbord.

05:06.854 --> 05:09.367
Alright then. Find out how
the two men are connected

05:09.394 --> 05:11.738
and if they are at all
connected to Mr. Foley.

05:11.759 --> 05:15.813
Oh, and find out what, if any,

05:15.860 --> 05:19.381
connection either may
have to James Gillies.

05:19.982 --> 05:21.617
Sir.

05:22.704 --> 05:25.169
I'm going to have another
chat with Mr. Foley.

05:25.392 --> 05:28.528
I'll go to the asylum and
see if there's a file on him.

05:28.866 --> 05:30.818
Are you alright?

05:31.318 --> 05:35.202
Yes. Whether he's insane
or just manipulative,

05:35.209 --> 05:37.122
he is in custody and of
no threat to either of us.

05:37.581 --> 05:40.196
James Gillies remains as dead as ever.

05:40.951 --> 05:43.951
Though I would be interested to
hear what Mr. Foley has to say.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.504
Let's meet back at the hotel later

05:46.525 --> 05:48.261
and I'll tell you all about it.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.759
I will. I will. I said I will.

06:03.244 --> 06:06.474
He wants to talk to you now.

06:06.798 --> 06:09.345
I'd much prefer to speak
with you, Mr. Foley.

06:09.892 --> 06:12.176
You see I don't believe
in demonic possession.

06:12.296 --> 06:14.757
Nor do I think you're insane.

06:14.803 --> 06:18.168
He doesn't want to talk to you now!

06:20.877 --> 06:23.633
Stop it! Stop it! Please. Please!

06:23.653 --> 06:26.484
Please talk to him. Please!
Before he drives me truly mad.

06:26.518 --> 06:29.559
Oh God! Oh God!

06:30.930 --> 06:34.841
All right. All right,
Mr. Foley. Have a seat.

06:51.743 --> 06:53.716
You disappoint me, William.

06:53.939 --> 06:56.796
A good Catholic such as yourself

06:56.843 --> 06:58.498
denying demonic possession.

06:58.539 --> 07:02.221
- What would your priest say?
- He would conclude,

07:02.227 --> 07:05.058
as I have, that this is all a big show

07:05.058 --> 07:07.625
you're putting on to escape the noose.

07:07.666 --> 07:09.611
I'm not, I swear.

07:12.415 --> 07:14.577
I'm doing as you ask!

07:18.644 --> 07:21.630
I apologize for Mr. Foley's stupidity.

07:21.671 --> 07:24.170
He doesn't appreciate
that it's rude to interrupt

07:24.197 --> 07:26.555
- a conversation between friends.
- Friends?

07:26.751 --> 07:28.278
Why of course.

07:29.177 --> 07:31.548
I know I sometimes
played a little rough.

07:32.514 --> 07:35.906
I kidnapped the woman you
loved and buried her alive.

07:37.129 --> 07:39.041
But it was all in good fun.

07:39.622 --> 07:42.601
I suppose in retrospect
it was impolite of me

07:42.628 --> 07:45.134
to kill her husband and
set her up for the crime.

07:46.032 --> 07:49.566
But William, the look on her face

07:49.573 --> 07:51.403
when the verdict came in...

07:51.667 --> 07:53.789
Guilty.

07:54.403 --> 07:57.795
Dr. Ogden, the nature of this crime

07:57.915 --> 08:00.402
is such that I have no recourse

08:00.443 --> 08:03.415
but to sentence you to
be hanged by the neck

08:03.449 --> 08:05.759
until you are dead.

08:07.077 --> 08:10.151
Such intense emotion.

08:10.414 --> 08:12.225
William.

08:12.252 --> 08:14.231
Julia. I'll get you out.

08:17.852 --> 08:20.406
I couldn't help but applaud.

08:20.811 --> 08:24.081
And the look on your face

08:24.054 --> 08:26.506
when you saw me...

08:29.330 --> 08:31.208
You were at the courthouse.

08:31.924 --> 08:34.099
That proves nothing, Mr. Foley.

08:36.153 --> 08:38.976
Ah, that's right. You don't
believe in demonic possession.

08:39.503 --> 08:41.402
OK then Detective, tell me,

08:41.416 --> 08:44.172
was Mr. Foley also in the lecture hall?

08:44.618 --> 08:46.665
What lecture hall?

08:47.388 --> 08:50.786
Surely you remember. It
was where we first met.

08:50.847 --> 08:53.887
Newton believed light
to be made of particles.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.528
Professor Godfrey was lecturing

08:56.541 --> 08:58.723
on the wave theory of light.

08:58.770 --> 09:01.087
And you came through the door.

09:02.263 --> 09:04.918
Well, a wave needs something
to push against, does it not?

09:04.952 --> 09:07.843
- That's what makes it a wave.
- You'd come to talk

09:07.883 --> 09:10.472
to Professor Godfrey about
Professor Bennett's murder.

09:11.802 --> 09:15.112
Robert Perry and I were such scamps.

09:15.119 --> 09:18.477
We'd thought we'd committed
the perfect murder.

09:22.929 --> 09:26.767
We even insinuated ourselves
into your investigation.

09:26.963 --> 09:29.882
May we be allowed to
observe your investigation?

09:30.002 --> 09:32.038
Observe? Quite dull, I should think.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.325
Actually, it might prove an
interesting exercise in applied physics.

09:35.328 --> 09:37.712
What do you think, sir?
Show these young toughs

09:37.746 --> 09:39.699
how things are done
outside the schoolyard?

09:39.726 --> 09:42.070
Something we never see. The
classroom's so theoretical.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.988
I can't see the harm. Why not?

09:45.108 --> 09:48.589
Ah, the folly of youthful arrogance.

09:48.886 --> 09:50.284
We mocked you

09:51.068 --> 09:54.169
and the cheerful chipmunk
that you worked with.

09:55.338 --> 09:57.790
Robert thought you were a rube,

09:58.215 --> 10:00.417
but as I watched you
work, I began to realize

10:00.438 --> 10:04.322
that I was in the company
of a mind to match my own.

10:05.167 --> 10:07.342
Such clarity.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.085
Such purpose.

10:10.205 --> 10:13.753
Like a bolt of lightning finds
the shortest route to ground,

10:13.800 --> 10:17.854
you knew exactly what to look for.

10:18.583 --> 10:22.326
And I experienced the unsettling thrill

10:22.360 --> 10:25.245
of realizing that you would defeat me.

10:25.259 --> 10:28.036
There are only two ways
for you to avoid this

10:28.401 --> 10:32.893
nine-foot drop, Mr. Perry.
One is to confess your crime

10:32.920 --> 10:35.846
- and to name your accomplice.
- And the other?

10:35.887 --> 10:37.826
- Robert, don't.
- You couldn't prove anything

10:37.873 --> 10:40.332
of course, so you tricked Robert

10:40.373 --> 10:42.102
into turning on me.

10:42.541 --> 10:45.744
I knew you were brilliant, but I failed

10:45.798 --> 10:48.736
to anticipate just how
devious you would be.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.979
- It wasn't my idea.
- Shut up, you fool.

10:53.351 --> 10:55.357
The timing device.
That was his invention.

10:55.398 --> 10:58.114
- You bloody coward.
- You tried to kill me.

10:58.648 --> 11:02.625
No, I didn't. Whatever
they said, it was a trick.

11:03.168 --> 11:05.904
Unfortunately, he's right, Mr. Perry.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.971
Poor Robert.

11:08.417 --> 11:12.166
He just was not made of
the same stuff as you and I.

11:15.118 --> 11:17.307
- Oh my God.
- It's a shame

11:17.347 --> 11:20.414
that he had to lose
his head. I was angry.

11:20.534 --> 11:23.589
I know, that's no excuse.

11:23.589 --> 11:25.636
I behaved badly towards Robert.

11:26.251 --> 11:28.663
I've told him as much.

11:29.838 --> 11:31.757
How did you do that?

11:32.264 --> 11:36.797
Why, Robert Perry is down here with me.

11:38.128 --> 11:39.972
Isn't it wonderful?

11:40.641 --> 11:43.910
Everything they taught
you in church is true.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.552
There is a Hell.

11:46.978 --> 11:49.274
It's everything they said it would be.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.443
That's why I returned.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.192
To take you back with me.

11:58.591 --> 12:04.048
Oh Detective, we are going
to have so... much... fun!

12:09.755 --> 12:12.155
I forgive you, William.

12:13.111 --> 12:15.738
I forgive you, William...
give you, William.

12:15.797 --> 12:18.413
I for... give... William.

12:18.429 --> 12:20.266
Give you, William. William. William.

12:20.331 --> 12:22.611
I for... I for... give...

12:32.648 --> 12:35.598
Hello, Detective Murdoch. Remember me?

12:35.961 --> 12:39.143
I know what you're
thinking. "Now I understand

12:39.181 --> 12:42.186
how rats get caught in
traps. They're easy to fool."

12:42.581 --> 12:45.987
Welcome to the Murdoch Trap, Detective.

12:46.154 --> 12:50.770
We are going to have so much fun!

13:02.771 --> 13:04.907
I went to the asylum.

13:05.111 --> 13:07.737
There's no record of Mr. Foley.

13:09.021 --> 13:11.698
William, are you alright?

13:13.015 --> 13:15.329
He knows things, Julia.

13:15.379 --> 13:19.357
He knows how I met Gillies,
what he did to Robert Perry...

13:19.568 --> 13:24.626
He even used the phrase "We're
going to have so much fun."

13:25.690 --> 13:28.814
Wasn't that on his filmed confession?

13:29.160 --> 13:31.482
William, everything he
told you could have been

13:31.499 --> 13:34.927
gleaned from newspapers
and court transcripts.

13:44.529 --> 13:48.109
You admit that you kidnapped
Dr. Ogden and buried her alive?

13:48.229 --> 13:51.757
Well, it wouldn't have been much
of a game if there were no stakes.

13:57.745 --> 14:00.388
Here! Start digging!

14:03.791 --> 14:06.587
William! Help!

14:10.631 --> 14:13.908
Quickly! She's running out of air.

14:15.530 --> 14:17.945
Julia. God, please.

14:18.511 --> 14:20.546
William.

14:20.571 --> 14:23.029
It's alright. You're with me now.

14:24.759 --> 14:27.284
- I'm so sorry.
- But Detective Murdoch won that game,

14:27.310 --> 14:30.130
did he not? Nicely
played, Detective Murdoch.

14:30.611 --> 14:32.902
Looks like you win again.

14:33.022 --> 14:36.186
I'm going to watch you hang in
person this time, Mr. Gillies.

14:36.306 --> 14:37.992
I'm flattered.

14:38.372 --> 14:43.177
Why do this? You could
have walked away a free man.

14:43.297 --> 14:46.614
I don't like to be bested.
You beat me the first time.

14:46.639 --> 14:48.565
I wanted a rematch.

14:48.685 --> 14:51.120
Well, the game is good and over now.

14:52.880 --> 14:55.566
- Driver.
- Unfortunately,

14:55.591 --> 14:58.006
you didn't hang, Mr.
Gillies. You escaped.

14:58.049 --> 14:59.940
But instead of securing your freedom,

14:59.991 --> 15:02.313
you returned to kill Dr. Ogden's husband

15:02.364 --> 15:05.244
and frame her for the
crime. Why, Mr. Gillies?

15:05.364 --> 15:08.470
I was conducting an
experiment. Doesn't every man

15:08.505 --> 15:10.354
tell his lover that
he would die for her?

15:10.649 --> 15:12.846
But how many truly would?

15:12.896 --> 15:15.438
Would you? I know you'd fight for her,

15:15.464 --> 15:16.883
to the death if necessary.

15:16.925 --> 15:20.083
But to actually trade your life?

15:20.203 --> 15:23.019
That is my experiment, Detective.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.813
_

15:24.855 --> 15:26.924
_

15:41.694 --> 15:44.583
Does any of this look
familiar, Mr. Foley?

15:44.703 --> 15:46.356
No.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.211
Everything that you've told me so far

15:49.253 --> 15:51.449
can be found in these documents.

15:51.694 --> 15:55.561
So if I'm to believe you are
possessed by James Gillies,

15:55.681 --> 15:59.480
you'll have to tell me something
that only James Gillies knows.

16:02.934 --> 16:04.893
I'm waiting.

16:11.167 --> 16:14.013
He wants to speak to you again.

16:16.995 --> 16:19.097
Very well.

16:21.302 --> 16:23.227
Hello, Julia.

16:24.257 --> 16:27.011
Do you remember our last conversation?

16:27.284 --> 16:29.637
Julia!

16:29.757 --> 16:32.433
To what do I owe the pleasure?

16:33.463 --> 16:35.946
I just wanted you to let you
know that I've made a request

16:35.972 --> 16:38.733
to the Kingston coroner
to have your brain removed.

16:39.746 --> 16:42.465
- My...
- Your brain, Mr. Gillies.

16:43.234 --> 16:45.176
After you are executed, of course.

16:45.986 --> 16:48.190
Well I'm flattered.

16:49.035 --> 16:51.636
Something made you, Mr. Gillies.

16:52.117 --> 16:55.217
I believe you may have
some physical abnormality

16:55.226 --> 16:56.813
that caused you to become what you are.

16:57.852 --> 17:00.683
- And what am I?
- A monster.

17:00.717 --> 17:04.328
- A monster?
- You confessed to killing six people.

17:04.362 --> 17:06.430
One of which was your late
husband. You still haven't

17:06.430 --> 17:09.816
- thanked me for that.
- He was an innocent man...

17:09.935 --> 17:13.861
Who was getting in the way of you
and the good detective's happiness.

17:13.896 --> 17:16.462
Now there's nothing between
you and the man of your dreams.

17:16.582 --> 17:19.536
Aren't you happy? Or do you feel guilty?

17:19.656 --> 17:22.128
Why should I feel
guilty? You killed him.

17:22.154 --> 17:23.935
Yes,

17:24.257 --> 17:26.587
but you caused that.

17:26.707 --> 17:29.990
He'd still be alive
if he hadn't met you.

17:31.451 --> 17:34.356
You know when I'll
be happy, Mr. Gillies?

17:34.846 --> 17:37.548
When I pronounce you dead.

17:37.768 --> 17:39.272
Well you'll just have to wait

17:39.314 --> 17:42.473
because that won't be
happening for some time.

17:43.503 --> 17:47.338
- Ask me why I want to live so badly.
- Why?

17:48.318 --> 17:51.567
Because I'm not done with you yet.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.513
Aren't you curious as
to why I've come back?

17:55.655 --> 17:57.972
Why have you?

17:59.384 --> 18:01.959
I'm not done with you yet.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.180
Julia...

18:18.036 --> 18:19.739
Julia?

18:20.549 --> 18:22.644
"I'm not done with you yet."

18:23.056 --> 18:25.353
That's the last thing
he ever said to me.

18:25.473 --> 18:29.486
Those exact words. I've never told
anyone about that conversation.

18:29.606 --> 18:31.880
- Julia.
- There's no other way

18:31.897 --> 18:33.638
that Mr. Foley could
have known about that.

18:33.658 --> 18:37.305
Oh, my God. James Gillies is alive.

18:41.792 --> 18:45.305
Julia, James Gillies is dead.

18:45.346 --> 18:48.197
- We've proven that.
- Did we?

18:48.317 --> 18:51.548
Is it possible someone
overheard that conversation?

18:51.581 --> 18:54.129
No. Which means he
must have communicated

18:54.149 --> 18:56.460
with Mr. Foley after the bridge.

19:00.864 --> 19:02.471
Stop!

19:03.261 --> 19:05.754
The water is too shallow.
You will be killed.

19:05.874 --> 19:07.619
No!

19:14.111 --> 19:15.874
Sir!

19:19.414 --> 19:21.380
No!

19:25.244 --> 19:27.892
Julia. That bridge is fifty feet high.

19:28.196 --> 19:30.265
The water was shallow. There were rocks.

19:30.292 --> 19:31.893
I barely survived the jump myself.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.419
Yes, but you did. Which
means he could have as well.

19:36.561 --> 19:38.594
Why did you jump?

19:38.614 --> 19:40.735
He was getting away.

19:41.884 --> 19:44.694
- Any sign of him?
- Sir, the river gets fast

19:44.714 --> 19:46.868
and deep down there. If
he was still handcuffed,

19:46.902 --> 19:48.977
- there's no way...
- You didn't see him?

19:49.902 --> 19:51.902
- No, sir.
- George!

19:51.936 --> 19:55.482
Sir, we'll keep looking. We'll
keep looking and we'll find him.

19:55.496 --> 19:58.590
It's over, William. We
have to believe that.

20:08.151 --> 20:10.164
We lied to ourselves.

20:10.833 --> 20:13.738
When the Inspector told us
that they had found his body,

20:13.779 --> 20:15.481
we leapt to believe it.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.901
We were stupid. I was stupid.

20:18.021 --> 20:20.156
The clothes on the corpse were a match,

20:20.183 --> 20:21.655
as were the height and weight.

20:21.669 --> 20:23.560
We had no reason to believe we hadn't

20:23.601 --> 20:25.729
- found the body of James Gillies.
- Five feet nine inches.

20:25.749 --> 20:28.101
Gillies is five foot ten inches.

20:28.221 --> 20:30.769
Bodies have been known
to shrink over time.

20:31.829 --> 20:35.403
We can't afford to be wishful
about this. We have to be exact.

20:35.464 --> 20:37.288
It's is not an exact science, William.

20:37.335 --> 20:39.166
The hair appears to be the same.

20:39.193 --> 20:42.260
It exhibits the same
curl. Unfortunately,

20:42.280 --> 20:44.118
of course, the left side
of the face is crushed.

20:44.238 --> 20:47.111
There were rocks in the river. He
may have struck one in the fall.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.496
Or Gillies found someone
with similar features,

20:50.523 --> 20:52.408
killed him and placed him in the river.

20:52.435 --> 20:54.934
We could rebuild the face on
the intact part of the skull.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.319
- Would that be definitive?
- Not definitive, no,

20:57.353 --> 20:59.622
but possibly convincing,
one way or the other.

20:59.676 --> 21:02.189
- If this isn't Gillies...
- Then he is alive

21:02.236 --> 21:03.790
and he will kill us.

21:04.404 --> 21:07.269
Look. Remember when
Constable Crabtree shot him?

21:07.302 --> 21:09.951
We never did take out the bullet.

21:14.991 --> 21:17.525
- The bullets match.
- I know.

21:17.532 --> 21:20.369
- You do?
- We took some liberties with the nose.

21:20.396 --> 21:23.038
And the lips are always
a bit of a guessing game.

21:28.773 --> 21:31.969
He's dead, William. He's really dead.

21:35.604 --> 21:38.259
We took liberties. We guessed.

21:38.522 --> 21:40.373
You were right, William.

21:40.744 --> 21:43.724
He found a man with similar
features and killed him.

21:44.494 --> 21:46.832
So he removed the bullet
from his own shoulder

21:46.859 --> 21:48.116
and placed it in the corpse.

21:48.157 --> 21:49.866
Knowing that that would
be the piece of evidence

21:49.900 --> 21:52.623
that would absolutely convince
us that it was his body.

21:53.163 --> 21:56.182
But doesn't that suggest
that he intended to disappear

21:56.236 --> 21:58.648
and never return? So why is he back?

21:58.709 --> 22:00.811
I don't know. I don't know.

22:01.115 --> 22:02.729
But until this is resolved,

22:02.736 --> 22:05.135
I want a constable at
your side at all times.

22:06.898 --> 22:10.243
If James Gillies is
back, he has a reason.

22:16.755 --> 22:19.971
- Where is he?
- He's in my head.

22:19.991 --> 22:22.362
He's not in your head.
You're working with him.

22:22.403 --> 22:25.977
- He's given you information. Now where is he?
- No, I already told you!

22:26.097 --> 22:28.780
You've told me nothing but lies!

22:28.827 --> 22:31.482
Stop, please, you're hurting...

22:31.530 --> 22:35.332
AHH! Ugh! Oof.

22:36.731 --> 22:39.806
What's the voice in your
head saying now, Mr. Foley?

22:41.576 --> 22:44.866
No, he's not saying anything.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.980
He's just laughing.

22:58.937 --> 23:00.633
If I don't keep my temper,

23:00.653 --> 23:02.903
I won't be able to get
to the bottom of this.

23:03.869 --> 23:06.807
That's what demons do. They
bring out the worst in us.

23:07.273 --> 23:11.766
That's just it, Julia. Foley
seems like just a broken man.

23:12.657 --> 23:15.649
He did kill two men.
And he knows things that

23:15.690 --> 23:18.169
- only Gillies could know.
- Sir,

23:18.514 --> 23:20.548
I've talked to the
wives of both victims.

23:21.054 --> 23:23.263
What's their connection to Gillies?

23:23.383 --> 23:26.627
Unknown sir. Neither knew
Jacob Foley, James Gillies,

23:26.661 --> 23:28.755
- or even each other.
- How odd.

23:29.687 --> 23:32.106
What were they doing
in that rooming house?

23:32.167 --> 23:34.897
Well, both men had
received letters from Foley

23:34.917 --> 23:37.227
enticing them there, sir.

23:49.267 --> 23:51.267
Did you write this?

23:53.443 --> 23:55.145
No.

23:57.084 --> 23:59.097
Do the names Robert Wilcox

23:59.104 --> 24:01.678
and Gerrard Berkeley
mean anything to you?

24:02.786 --> 24:04.414
No sir.

24:08.731 --> 24:12.534
I would like to speak
with Mr. Gillies again.

24:21.195 --> 24:23.256
Hello William.

24:24.087 --> 24:27.255
Are you here to beat up Mr. Foley again?

24:28.208 --> 24:30.079
Tut tut.

24:30.404 --> 24:33.902
And I thought I was the violent one.

24:36.093 --> 24:38.316
Why kill Robert Wilcox

24:38.573 --> 24:40.472
and Gerrard Berkeley?

24:41.357 --> 24:43.539
Because of their names.

24:44.059 --> 24:47.053
That's a clue, by the way.

24:47.938 --> 24:50.073
What about their names?

24:50.107 --> 24:52.782
I can't tell you that.

24:53.404 --> 24:56.815
It won't be any fun if I
just give away the game.

24:57.727 --> 25:00.328
What's the game?

25:01.571 --> 25:04.192
The same as it's always been.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.483
You and I having a ton of fun.

25:07.686 --> 25:09.618
But at the end of the day,

25:09.638 --> 25:14.266
someone wins and someone loses.

25:15.570 --> 25:19.894
The question is, what are
you in danger of losing?

25:21.502 --> 25:24.211
Or should I say, who?

25:24.495 --> 25:27.258
Temper, temper, William. Be a good boy

25:27.378 --> 25:29.352
and I'll give you a hint.

25:32.034 --> 25:35.054
It's one I've given you before.

25:39.391 --> 25:42.215
You really are wasting time, Detective.

25:42.620 --> 25:46.632
- How much time do I have?
- 37 minutes, by my calculations. Less,

25:46.676 --> 25:49.005
if she loses faith
you'll find her in time.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.546
You mean if she panics.

25:50.578 --> 25:53.611
You've rigged some sort of device
to be triggered by her heart rate.

25:53.665 --> 25:58.178
Oh, I like that. I almost
wish I'd done it, but... no.

25:58.567 --> 26:00.172
You know what's funny? Well,

26:00.205 --> 26:01.820
I guess you won't find it that amusing,

26:01.836 --> 26:04.620
but you will appreciate the
irony when you discover it.

26:04.740 --> 26:06.554
Discover what?

26:06.954 --> 26:08.748
That it was you who killed her.

26:08.970 --> 26:13.056
You were so hell-bent on
finding me, you sealed her fate.

26:13.099 --> 26:16.283
Of course I knew you'd do
that. You're so predictable.

26:16.299 --> 26:17.958
It's really not fair.

26:18.752 --> 26:20.984
Tell you what, Detective. Here's a hint:

26:21.104 --> 26:24.038
You already have all the
clues you need to find her.

26:24.741 --> 26:28.782
are you smart enough to
figure it out in time?

26:30.366 --> 26:33.938
So you're saying I have
all the clues already?

26:36.040 --> 26:38.656
Until we meet again, Detective.

26:45.731 --> 26:48.342
- He's gone.
- What?

26:49.120 --> 26:52.790
The voice... it's gone!

26:57.763 --> 27:00.404
AAGH!

27:00.524 --> 27:04.868
No! Make it stop! Make it stop!

27:04.988 --> 27:07.517
Mr. Foley! Mr. Foley! Stop!

27:12.062 --> 27:15.532
Mr. Foley! Put down the gun!

27:16.813 --> 27:18.975
NO!

27:27.715 --> 27:30.710
Mr. Foley was our only
link to James Gillies.

27:30.721 --> 27:32.266
There's nothing you
could have done, William.

27:33.007 --> 27:35.472
He said I have all the clues I need.

27:35.807 --> 27:37.586
Perhaps it's true.

27:38.078 --> 27:39.988
I have only questions.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.672
If Mr. Foley was in
league with James Gillies,

27:42.688 --> 27:44.380
then why kill himself?

27:45.537 --> 27:48.304
And if Gillies engineered
his suicide, then how?

27:49.385 --> 27:53.093
- Detective, Doctor.
- What is it, Miss James?

27:53.213 --> 27:55.036
We're not the first ones in here.

28:00.719 --> 28:03.681
Foley said the devil entered
him through his chest.

28:04.778 --> 28:06.648
Open him up, Miss James.

28:11.005 --> 28:13.010
His spleen has been removed.

28:13.420 --> 28:15.023
And...

28:15.496 --> 28:18.247
There's something clipped onto his rib.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.711
Good lord!

28:22.791 --> 28:24.547
There's wire attached.

28:25.067 --> 28:26.812
It runs underneath the skin.

28:27.336 --> 28:28.996
Follow it.

28:37.642 --> 28:39.610
This was embedded in his skull

28:39.669 --> 28:41.442
right behind the left cochlea.

28:41.837 --> 28:43.972
The wires were threaded subcutaneously

28:44.092 --> 28:45.529
between the muscles and skin.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.604
It's a magnet and coil.
Similar to a telephone speaker,

28:49.631 --> 28:52.231
only it has no diaphragm.
It must have vibrated

28:52.247 --> 28:54.112
directly against his skull.

28:54.345 --> 28:56.755
It's a small wonder it drove him mad.

28:56.825 --> 28:58.674
What is it connected to?

28:58.717 --> 29:01.084
Some sort of wireless
transmission device.

29:01.425 --> 29:04.376
I'm going to need to speak
with Reginald Fessenden.

29:04.652 --> 29:06.760
- Who's that?
- He's an inventor.

29:06.966 --> 29:09.495
He specializes in wireless
voice transmission.

29:09.733 --> 29:13.111
I believe he's currently working
at the Toronto Power House.

29:17.267 --> 29:18.824
This was in a man's body?

29:19.272 --> 29:22.294
Yes. It looks like a scaled-down version

29:22.321 --> 29:24.202
of your electrolytic detector.

29:24.543 --> 29:27.624
That's exactly what it
is. And I should know.

29:27.659 --> 29:30.028
- I designed it.
- You did?

29:30.418 --> 29:33.498
About six months ago, I was asked
to design a version of my detector

29:33.520 --> 29:37.130
small enough to be worn
on a person, not inside.

29:37.482 --> 29:40.492
I was paid a commission and
given full patent rights.

29:44.669 --> 29:46.476
Is this the man that commissioned you?

29:46.511 --> 29:48.382
We never met in person, but I think not.

29:48.388 --> 29:50.009
I was commissioned by a woman.

29:50.199 --> 29:53.663
- What was her name?
- Gillian James.

29:53.976 --> 29:56.935
George. You interviewed a woman earlier,

29:56.987 --> 30:00.284
blonde hair, heavily rouged.
Lives near Veronica Bowden's home.

30:00.284 --> 30:02.381
- Miss James.
- Yes. What's her address?

30:02.393 --> 30:05.126
It's right here, sir.
Miss Gillian James.

30:05.331 --> 30:08.817
Gillian James... James Gillies!

30:10.309 --> 30:12.002
Do you have an address?

30:12.460 --> 30:14.571
Not for Miss James,

30:14.691 --> 30:17.670
but I have an address for where
I sent the design specifications.

30:18.307 --> 30:19.977
Let's see.

30:22.058 --> 30:26.106
740 Robert Street. Leonard Wright.

30:26.117 --> 30:27.939
Who's that?

30:28.619 --> 30:30.317
The man who built this.

30:31.279 --> 30:33.376
Henry.

30:34.522 --> 30:37.488
- Sir?
- Go to 740 Robert Street.

30:37.553 --> 30:40.012
Bring in a man named Leonard Wright.

30:40.031 --> 30:42.060
Be careful, bring a constable with you.

30:42.076 --> 30:43.800
This man has worked with James Gillies.

30:43.838 --> 30:45.449
Sir.

30:46.735 --> 30:48.779
What's this device capable of?

30:48.899 --> 30:51.141
It can receive a signal
from a nearby source.

30:51.331 --> 30:52.969
How nearby?

30:53.444 --> 30:55.957
A city block. Maybe two.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.238
- Can it send signals out?
- Oh heavens no.

30:59.281 --> 31:00.892
It's strictly one way.

31:01.195 --> 31:03.670
William, if this device is only one way,

31:03.702 --> 31:06.637
then how was Gillies able
to hear what we were saying?

31:14.106 --> 31:16.041
William, what are you doing?

31:17.138 --> 31:19.202
I'm looking for a microphone.

31:19.237 --> 31:21.143
There has to be a microphone.

31:58.828 --> 32:00.746
Where does it go to?

32:28.831 --> 32:31.241
He was right next door the whole time.

32:33.988 --> 32:37.258
"Detective Murdoch. I'm
sorry to have missed you.

32:37.279 --> 32:39.115
I look forward to seeing you very soon.

32:39.150 --> 32:42.700
Remember, you have all the
clues you need. James Gillies."

32:43.084 --> 32:45.547
There was only one
clue: the victims' names.

32:45.796 --> 32:47.958
- Robert Wilcox.
- And Gerrard Berkeley.

32:48.184 --> 32:50.849
I've tried ciphers,
anagrams, everything!

32:55.340 --> 32:58.447
Oh, sir, I've spoken with Mr. Wright.

32:58.463 --> 33:01.004
He's a jeweller who specializes
in microscopic construction.

33:01.038 --> 33:03.024
He admits to building the device, sir.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.242
In fact he was asked to
build two such devices.

33:05.276 --> 33:08.229
- Did you bring him in?
- He's in the interview room, sir.

33:08.279 --> 33:11.180
- Alright.
- Sir, this is probably nothing,

33:11.223 --> 33:14.070
but 740 Robert Street
is at the intersection

33:14.146 --> 33:16.353
of Robert and Willcocks.

33:17.708 --> 33:19.313
Robert Wilcox.

33:19.334 --> 33:21.209
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

33:21.225 --> 33:23.311
No, no, Henry, it isn't a coincidence.

33:23.771 --> 33:26.129
This is the clue that
Gillies alluded to.

33:26.149 --> 33:30.440
- What's at the corner of Gerrard and Berkeley?
- Veronica Bowden's house.

33:32.039 --> 33:33.870
She's the girl that Gillies kidnapped.

33:33.990 --> 33:35.644
Veronica,

33:36.071 --> 33:38.308
who took you from your bed last night?

33:40.849 --> 33:43.605
Was it a man, or a woman?

33:44.453 --> 33:46.745
- A man.
- A man.

33:47.096 --> 33:49.041
Did you know him?

33:49.539 --> 33:51.198
No.

33:52.063 --> 33:53.683
What did the man look like?

33:53.710 --> 33:56.624
I never saw him. I was sleeping.

33:57.623 --> 34:02.083
Veronica, did this man
hurt you in any way?

34:02.100 --> 34:05.743
No, he was nice. He said we
were playing hide and seek.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.704
Hmm?

34:08.348 --> 34:11.223
Did he say who you were hiding from?

34:11.272 --> 34:13.514
You. But you found me.

34:14.509 --> 34:16.446
Yes, yes I did.

34:19.016 --> 34:23.469
Veronica, did the man ever
make a voice like this?

34:24.038 --> 34:25.855
Help me, Detective Murdoch.

34:25.889 --> 34:29.377
I've lost my head. Can
you help me find it?

34:31.777 --> 34:34.726
- No.
- No.

34:36.446 --> 34:37.500
Well,

34:37.753 --> 34:40.991
- thank you.
- But he said you were a bad person.

34:41.056 --> 34:43.455
And that you aren't very clever.

34:44.018 --> 34:45.755
Do you remember me?

34:45.958 --> 34:49.931
Yes. You're the detective who
found me when I was kidnapped.

34:49.985 --> 34:53.097
That's right Miss Bowden.
I'm Detective Murdoch.

34:53.833 --> 34:56.422
Do you remember the
man who kidnapped you?

34:56.543 --> 34:58.709
His name was James Gillies.

34:58.723 --> 35:00.503
That's right.

35:01.025 --> 35:04.103
Has he contacted you or your mother?

35:04.161 --> 35:07.686
- I thought he was dead.
- So did I.

35:07.806 --> 35:11.302
- Are you here about the doll?
- What doll?

35:11.422 --> 35:13.767
It arrived yesterday.

35:25.407 --> 35:29.667
Please stop. No, don't!
William, please help me.

35:30.022 --> 35:34.432
That's Julia. George, he has Julia!

35:38.139 --> 35:41.331
It doesn't work. It just
makes a crackling sound.

35:41.798 --> 35:44.695
See, I told you.

35:44.771 --> 35:46.436
Hello, City Morgue.

35:46.470 --> 35:49.062
- It's working now.
- Julia.

35:49.306 --> 35:51.770
- William?
- Meet me back at the hotel.

35:51.791 --> 35:54.705
Right now? Are you finished
at the Bowden House?

35:54.745 --> 35:57.969
Meet me back at the hotel and
I'll tell you all about it.

35:58.034 --> 35:59.466
Hello, City Morgue.

35:59.785 --> 36:03.466
That's a funny message to put in a doll.

36:05.942 --> 36:07.871
Hey!

36:10.936 --> 36:13.463
The message wasn't
for you. It was for me.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.591
Julia!

36:50.088 --> 36:54.044
Hello, Detective. How
nice of you to drop in.

36:59.522 --> 37:02.616
- Where is she?
- Who?

37:03.205 --> 37:05.626
Julia? She's at the morgue.

37:06.183 --> 37:09.091
You're so gullible. When I
suggested you may lose someone,

37:09.134 --> 37:11.842
you assumed I meant your wife.

37:12.377 --> 37:15.999
- Who then?
- You remember this little fella?

37:18.161 --> 37:19.874
Roland!

37:23.700 --> 37:25.624
I've been watching you, Detective.

37:26.062 --> 37:29.359
These last few years I've basked
in the glow of your happiness.

37:29.673 --> 37:33.397
You got married. You're
building her a house.

37:33.656 --> 37:36.958
It seems as though you are constructing
a tiny, perfect little life.

37:37.655 --> 37:40.622
Be such a shame to see
that all come undone.

37:43.233 --> 37:45.378
What do you want with me, Gillies?

37:45.665 --> 37:47.832
Well, I need your...

37:47.859 --> 37:51.740
help with something I'm
having a little trouble with.

37:52.307 --> 37:56.296
- Help with what?
- I want you to kill me.

37:57.551 --> 37:59.275
Kill you?

37:59.955 --> 38:01.161
Why?

38:03.626 --> 38:05.311
Look at me.

38:07.014 --> 38:08.765
What happened to you?

38:09.019 --> 38:12.008
I jumped off a bridge, remember?

38:12.051 --> 38:14.694
I smashed my face on one rock.

38:14.737 --> 38:16.126
Crushed my spine on another.

38:16.153 --> 38:18.212
Do you know what happens to
a spine when it's crushed?

38:19.309 --> 38:21.570
It severs the spinal cord.

38:21.604 --> 38:24.541
If you're lucky. If you're unlucky,

38:24.552 --> 38:27.573
it merely drives bone shards
into your vertebral nerves.

38:27.577 --> 38:29.292
You're in pain.

38:29.478 --> 38:31.324
Pain?!

38:31.778 --> 38:36.334
It is agony at the center of
every thought, every dream.

38:36.377 --> 38:40.036
You see, I've tried opiates,

38:40.047 --> 38:43.414
but, see, they just dull the mind.

38:43.857 --> 38:45.533
And a mind like mine? Well,

38:45.803 --> 38:48.614
that's like painting
over the Sistine Chapel.

38:49.236 --> 38:51.057
Why not kill yourself?

38:51.177 --> 38:54.105
Because I want my life to be taken

38:54.143 --> 38:57.520
by the object of my
admiration and ardour.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.660
Ardour?

38:59.990 --> 39:03.119
Don't you remember our
moment on the bridge?

39:13.762 --> 39:15.464
Hi.

39:21.220 --> 39:23.765
I'm not going to shoot you, Mr. Gillies.

39:24.025 --> 39:26.149
But if it's any consolation,

39:26.765 --> 39:29.954
- I will watch you hang.
- Oh I won't hang.

39:30.074 --> 39:34.164
No, the shock of the force
ripping apart my vertebrae

39:34.197 --> 39:37.591
while I'm still conscious?
It... terrifies me.

39:37.661 --> 39:40.666
The lecture you gave left
quite an indelible impression.

39:42.796 --> 39:47.049
Heroin is wonderful, but
too much can be deadly,

39:47.104 --> 39:48.893
as I'm sure you know.

39:49.763 --> 39:52.406
His eyes will roll back

39:52.428 --> 39:54.936
and he'll just stop breathing.

39:56.325 --> 39:57.860
Painless.

40:00.379 --> 40:02.265
I know what you're thinking.

40:03.010 --> 40:05.697
Can you get to me before I get to him?

40:05.817 --> 40:08.469
At what point does the risk of his death

40:08.518 --> 40:10.939
trump your desire to see justice done?

40:18.673 --> 40:20.489
Oh, my goodness.

40:22.786 --> 40:25.775
- You took the bullets out.
- All but one.

40:27.418 --> 40:29.056
I needed to know, and now I do.

40:29.850 --> 40:31.683
See, I wanted to die, I did,

40:31.699 --> 40:34.379
but when you pulled the
trigger all I could think was

40:35.120 --> 40:37.076
'not yet.'

40:37.882 --> 40:40.341
There's still so much I want to do.

40:41.579 --> 40:43.654
Now drop that gun

40:43.774 --> 40:46.264
or say goodbye to this little chap.

40:49.365 --> 40:51.252
If you hurt him...

40:53.808 --> 40:55.890
William, I want to thank you.

40:56.592 --> 40:59.834
You have given me the gift of life.

40:59.845 --> 41:03.612
A new sense of purpose.
For that I thank you.

41:05.823 --> 41:09.850
We are going to have so... much...

41:11.742 --> 41:14.855
The act of hanging a man
requires a rigorous application

41:14.871 --> 41:16.303
of Newtonian principles.

41:16.330 --> 41:18.713
Can anyone tell me
the variables required

41:18.724 --> 41:20.523
to determine the amount of force

41:20.534 --> 41:22.307
needed to break a neck?

41:22.351 --> 41:24.761
Anyone? Mr. Gillies?

41:25.896 --> 41:30.371
Force is simply the product
of mass times acceleration.

41:30.403 --> 41:32.587
Exactly. Or in this case,

41:33.252 --> 41:37.279
rapid deceleration as
the rope snaps taut.

41:37.399 --> 41:40.181
I think this is all
in utterly poor taste.

41:46.019 --> 41:47.970
A rubber bullet?

41:49.759 --> 41:51.352
As I said,

41:51.747 --> 41:54.060
I intended to see you hang.

41:55.731 --> 41:58.109
Good bye, Mr. Gillies.
