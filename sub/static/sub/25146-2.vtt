00:02.500 --> 00:06.628
This is "World of Dance,"

00:08.000 --> 00:12.800
the biggest dance show
in the world.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.133
Last week...

00:16.167 --> 00:18.467
the competition began.

00:18.467 --> 00:22.800
I want more.
Can I have some more?

00:22.800 --> 00:25.367
Yeah, guys.
What up?

00:25.367 --> 00:27.600
You're through to the next round.
Congratulations.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.200
Now the battle continues

00:36.200 --> 00:37.867
in round two of the qualifiers.

00:37.867 --> 00:39.433
What?

00:41.033 --> 00:43.967
Absolutely extraordinary.

00:49.333 --> 00:52.767
We are totally going to be in
beast mode for this competition.

00:56.433 --> 00:59.067
We're going to give it 100%
and do everything we can

00:59.067 --> 01:00.633
to come out on top.

01:03.233 --> 01:05.900
We're here to win
so watch out.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.500
The acts will be
awarded points from 0 to 20

01:11.100 --> 01:12.567
performance,

01:12.567 --> 01:14.033
technique,

01:14.033 --> 01:16.000
choreography,

01:16.000 --> 01:17.367
creativity,

01:17.367 --> 01:19.133
and presentation.

01:19.133 --> 01:22.967
They'll need 80 points or more
to make it to the next round,

01:22.967 --> 01:24.967
the duels,

01:24.967 --> 01:28.033
and fight their way through the cut,

01:28.033 --> 01:31.250
the divisional final,
and then

01:32.645 --> 01:33.767
the three division winners

01:33.767 --> 01:35.833
will go head-to-head

01:35.833 --> 01:39.900
for the life-changing
$1 million prize.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.533
Let's see if you're going through.

01:49.233 --> 01:52.700
Please welcome your host,
Jenna Dewan-Tatum.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.800
Make some noise for
the "World of Dance" judges.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.133
Emmy Award-winning
choreographer Derek Hough.

02:06.133 --> 02:12.700
Multi-platinum R&B singer
and dancer Ne-Yo,

02:12.700 --> 02:16.700
and global pop phenomenon,
Jennifer Lopez.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.533
This is "World of Dance."

02:23.533 --> 02:25.467
"World of Dance" audience,
make some noise!

02:38.300 --> 02:40.567
We are... The Lab!

02:40.567 --> 02:43.167
And we're a hip-hop group
from West Covina, California.

02:43.167 --> 02:45.233
The Lab is a home away from home.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.767
I feel like we're all connected,

02:46.767 --> 02:48.067
like brothers and sisters.

02:48.067 --> 02:50.933
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

02:50.933 --> 02:52.600
Boom, boom, dada, dada,

02:52.600 --> 02:55.000
hit, hit, boom, build and chill.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.567
Sit down.
Good, let's go from this one.

02:57.567 --> 03:00.067
My name is Valerie, and
I'm the creator of The Lab.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.467
You're skilled enough to be able
to connect on stage.

03:02.467 --> 03:04.900
Prove to yourself
what you have in you.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.767
The majority of the kids
come from broken homes,

03:07.767 --> 03:10.467
and these kids would definitely
be described as underprivileged.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.200
One and two and...

03:12.200 --> 03:13.967
Having to, you know, kind of
fend for themselves at times,

03:13.967 --> 03:15.267
put themselves to bed,

03:15.267 --> 03:17.200
get themselves to practice,
feed themselves.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.800
Good, again.
One and two and...

03:18.800 --> 03:20.967
This is something that's
really inspiring for me

03:20.967 --> 03:22.767
because I'm not just teaching dance,

03:22.767 --> 03:24.767
It's actually more about
teaching them life lessons,

03:24.767 --> 03:27.433
and dance is just kind of
the icing on the cake.

03:27.433 --> 03:31.465
No matter their circumstances,
these are exceptionally skilled kids

03:31.471 --> 03:32.621
pursuing their dreams.

03:32.633 --> 03:35.633
Their bond is the most
special part about

03:35.633 --> 03:37.067
what they're going
to bring to the stage.

03:37.067 --> 03:39.267
There's been a lot of arguing
in my family,

03:39.267 --> 03:41.367
and all the negativity
just gets thrown away

03:41.367 --> 03:42.933
when I walk into the door.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.500
This crew means the world to me,

03:44.500 --> 03:47.533
and I wouldn't be where I am
right now if it wasn't for them.

03:47.533 --> 03:51.000
Oh, now I'm going to cry.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.900
We just support each other
and love each other,

03:52.900 --> 03:54.700
- and we always get to hang out.
- Sleepovers.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.267
Sleepovers!

03:56.267 --> 03:58.567
We're underdogs, but we're here
to make a statement

03:58.567 --> 04:01.300
that we're not going anywhere.
We're here to stay.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.333
Next on stage, it's The Lab.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.067
- Oh, my God.
- They're getting hyped.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.166
Hey yo.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.567
You ready?

04:27.567 --> 04:28.567
Let's do it.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.967
Come on, yeah!

05:16.167 --> 05:17.833
Whoo!

05:45.900 --> 05:48.067
- Oh!
- What?

05:48.067 --> 05:49.433
Come on!

05:56.533 --> 05:59.900
Oh, my goodness.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.600
This what goes on in The Lab?

06:04.733 --> 06:08.700
You guys came out like professionals.

06:08.700 --> 06:12.033
Seriously. Oh, my God.

06:12.033 --> 06:15.100
It was, from beginning to end, exciting,

06:15.100 --> 06:19.200
unexpected, innovative,
your moves, your synchronicity,

06:19.200 --> 06:22.000
everything about it
was just so in sync.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.067
There's something about being
a kid that makes you fearless.

06:24.067 --> 06:27.000
You're just like, you go all out
and honestly,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.133
that's what it's going to take
to win this competition.

06:29.133 --> 06:31.033
You can't be in your head.
You got to come out here

06:31.033 --> 06:33.333
and attack like a beast,
and they did that.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.100
Beast.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.833
Who did the 540 in the middle?
Who did the flip?

06:37.833 --> 06:39.900
Man, like effortless, effortless.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.367
Do you guys go to,
like, the competitions and

06:41.367 --> 06:42.967
- do the conventions and stuff?
- Yes.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.800
You can tell the difference
between people who are used

06:44.800 --> 06:46.433
to competing and people who are not.

06:46.433 --> 06:49.200
This isn't like a showcase.
This isn't like a presentation.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.500
This is a competition,
and you guys competed.

06:54.333 --> 06:56.400
- Hi there, what's your name?
- Kaya.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.593
Kaya? Kaya, you gave me life

06:58.793 --> 07:01.241
to the whole performance.
Did you see her face?

07:01.495 --> 07:02.500
Yeah!

07:02.500 --> 07:04.867
Kaya came out like...

07:04.867 --> 07:06.767
Kaya came out with the monster.

07:06.767 --> 07:08.567
Yeah, you're a little monster
in the front.

07:08.567 --> 07:10.300
- Yeah, yeah, listen.
- All of you, all you guys.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.180
- So good.
- Start to finish,

07:11.489 --> 07:13.151
top to bottom, there was
a lot of energy.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.700
There was a lot of passion
in what you were doing.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.233
- That's it.
- Set the bar.

07:16.233 --> 07:17.600
That's what it did.
Set the bar.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.667
Yes.

07:22.300 --> 07:25.367
We're going to lock in our scores
right now, okay?

07:27.867 --> 07:30.200
Remember, if you don't score 80
or above,

07:30.200 --> 07:32.200
the competition ends here for you.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.567
We have this checklist.

07:33.567 --> 07:35.267
It's got performance,
technique, choreography,

07:35.267 --> 07:38.600
creativity, presentation,
it's like the whole criteria,

07:38.600 --> 07:41.333
and so that's very clear
about what we're looking for.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.767
All right, let's see
if you guys are going through.

07:58.567 --> 08:01.700
You guys, you're through
to the next round.

08:01.700 --> 08:05.233
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.700
You guys were great!

08:12.700 --> 08:13.767
How do you feel?

08:13.767 --> 08:15.600
- Amazing.
- Love it.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.501
Amazing.  Oh, I'm so happy
for you guys.

08:17.603 --> 08:18.157
Congratulations.

08:18.342 --> 08:19.661
I can't wait to see what else
you guys have in store.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.467
Thank you.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.100
That's how you set it up.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.300
That had absolutely,
like, every single thing

08:25.300 --> 08:26.667
- you could want.
- Sickening.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.900
Groove, tricks,
the dynamics, musicality.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.133
I did not expect them
to do tricks like that.

08:31.133 --> 08:33.600
- No.
- Like, I was like, "What?"

08:42.967 --> 08:45.000
You weren't just in sync physically.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.067
You were in sync emotionally.

08:47.067 --> 08:50.000
It was risky, but man did it pay off.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.467
It's always nice when younguns do

08:51.467 --> 08:53.233
some fresh and exciting stuff!

08:53.233 --> 08:57.200
Your range of movement is endless, bam.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.767
That's something that's either
in you or it's not.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.567
Who's next?

09:15.700 --> 09:17.600
Only if everybody hits
the dab at the same time.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.600
Are you ready?
One, two, three.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.633
- Whoa!
- Roll the video, all right.

09:22.633 --> 09:23.900
Let's go.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.567
My name is Fik-Shun.
I am 22 years old,

09:30.567 --> 09:35.900
and I'm a freestyle street
dancer from Las Vegas, Nevada.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.267
I am the male winner
of season ten

09:38.267 --> 09:39.833
"So You Think You Can Dance?"

09:39.833 --> 09:42.700
I think I'm known for being
very entertaining.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.767
I make people laugh when I dance.

09:45.767 --> 09:47.300
Little old-timer.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.433
It's less of a choice
and more of a natural instinct,

09:49.433 --> 09:50.600
but there's more
to entertaining than just

09:50.600 --> 09:51.867
making people laugh and smile.

09:51.867 --> 09:53.467
It's also making them feel something.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.833
And this is the fiercest
competition I've been around.

09:56.833 --> 10:00.300
I feel like I won't go far
if I don't show the judges

10:00.300 --> 10:02.633
that I can portray
different emotions.

10:05.433 --> 10:09.800
So tonight I'm just ready to
kind of share that realness.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.733
This particular dance
is about growing up

10:11.733 --> 10:14.167
with separated parents.

10:14.167 --> 10:17.700
This story means a lot to me,
and I've lived through it.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.767
Deep down inside, there's
feelings that I don't express.

10:20.767 --> 10:22.700
I've never had the guts
to share my story

10:22.700 --> 10:24.633
like this before.

10:24.633 --> 10:27.933
So I can see you're feeling
a lot of emotions.

10:27.933 --> 10:31.767
I just--I called my dad,
and I was texting my mom too,

10:31.767 --> 10:33.600
just letting her know
that, like, I love her.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.500
I didn't realize how emotionally

10:36.500 --> 10:38.400
not ready I was to do this piece.

10:38.400 --> 10:42.067
You are full of emotion,
full of heart.

10:42.067 --> 10:43.633
You're doing it for people
that love you

10:43.633 --> 10:46.133
and doing it for the love
of your own passion and craft.

10:46.133 --> 10:48.400
Next up on stage, Fik-Shun.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.133
You got this, you got this.

10:52.133 --> 10:54.300
I have to be strong because this is

10:54.300 --> 10:57.233
a very hard thing for me to do,

10:57.233 --> 11:03.100
but with big risks come
big rewards so no holding back.

12:52.567 --> 12:56.700
Fik-Shun, this was obviously
a very emotional performance.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.533
I want you to tell me
about what it was for you.

12:58.533 --> 13:00.500
You know, I feel like people
are very blessed

13:00.500 --> 13:02.933
to have both parents
in their life.

13:02.933 --> 13:05.867
I wasn't.

13:05.867 --> 13:08.967
My parents have always been separated,

13:08.967 --> 13:11.967
and, you know, as a kid,

13:11.967 --> 13:14.933
to have your mom
a thousand miles away,

13:14.933 --> 13:17.600
your dad a thousand miles
away apart, it's tough.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.000
And so no matter
how far apart they are,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.600
I'm just always trying

13:21.600 --> 13:26.833
to be the one in the middle
to bring them together and...

13:29.800 --> 13:33.933
as a kid--I mean,
it's just tough for a kid.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.933
I get it. I get it.

13:40.933 --> 13:43.233
As a performer and a dancer,
you were so connected

13:43.233 --> 13:47.367
to every single beat.

13:47.367 --> 13:51.167
Each part of your body almost
became a part of the song,

13:51.167 --> 13:55.367
and it was such
a moving thing to watch.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.433
And a lot of kids have to go
through this unfortunately,

13:58.433 --> 14:02.033
and there's a lot of moms
out there like your mom,

14:02.033 --> 14:05.367
and it's great that you somehow

14:05.367 --> 14:08.200
kind of find through your art,

14:08.200 --> 14:09.900
the bright side of it,

14:09.900 --> 14:12.067
and from that pain

14:12.067 --> 14:14.127
comes beautiful moments
like this right now.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.300
I was really surprised
and pleasantly surprised

14:23.300 --> 14:26.633
to see that style in an emotional way.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.467
We were sucked into it.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.000
I mean, we were right there with you.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.600
We were on that journey with you.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.300
We were on every little emotion.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.167
The way you popped,
the way you hit things,

14:35.167 --> 14:37.300
the textures, is incredible.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.700
Thank you.

14:39.700 --> 14:42.833
The performance was water.

14:42.833 --> 14:45.033
Water crashes, water flows,

14:45.033 --> 14:46.833
water is rough, water is soft.

14:46.833 --> 14:49.600
You gave us all of that in a minute.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.867
You gave us all of that in a minute.

14:54.833 --> 14:56.233
You can't teach that.
Like, that's something

14:56.233 --> 14:57.433
that's either in you or it's not.

14:57.433 --> 14:59.133
Thank you.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.333
We're going to lock
in our scores, okay?

15:07.133 --> 15:08.667
Let's see how you did.

15:22.333 --> 15:25.033
Fik-Shun, you're through
to the next round!

15:38.900 --> 15:41.167
- That was awesome.
- That's the level.

15:41.167 --> 15:43.100
- Yep.
- Tell a story

15:43.100 --> 15:45.867
while being passionate,
while being dynamic.

15:45.867 --> 15:48.233
- Yes.
- Be technical, be precise.

15:49.663 --> 15:51.369
__

15:52.933 --> 15:54.200
We'll see, we'll see.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.933
We hold things in so much,

15:55.933 --> 15:57.833
so many feelings
that we don't express,

15:57.833 --> 16:01.400
and I feel like we just have to
not be afraid to let that out.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.767
We are... The Miami All Stars.

16:18.767 --> 16:20.933
19 dancers from Miami, Florida,

16:20.933 --> 16:22.700
and best known for our Latin dance.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.733
Five, six, seven, eight.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.967
Being from Miami, all of
us are pretty much

16:26.967 --> 16:28.733
first and second generation
South Americans

16:28.733 --> 16:31.033
or Caribbean, Cuban, Chile,

16:31.033 --> 16:32.967
and our parents have always
taught us to work hard.

16:32.967 --> 16:35.733
Guys, keep on working.
We're a ragtag group.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.567
This is not people who are
just dancing 24/7.

16:38.567 --> 16:41.367
We have teachers, we have lawyers,
software engineers.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.367
- Just the list goes on and on.
- Sexy moms.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.833
We just need to do what we do.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.767
Dancing became our life.

16:48.767 --> 16:51.100
We would miss weddings,
quinceaneras, graduations,

16:51.100 --> 16:53.368
things that we sacrificed
because we really believe

16:53.642 --> 16:54.400
in this group.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.533
I'm ready for some Miami,
like, flavor and speed.

16:57.533 --> 17:00.033
Whoo, I'm ready for this, yes.

17:00.033 --> 17:04.333
Next to take the stage
is Miami All Stars.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.133
Miami All Stars.

18:35.133 --> 18:36.833
You look very Miami,
by the way.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.733
I want to ask you guys a question.

18:40.733 --> 18:43.167
Are you guys full-time
professional dancers,

18:43.167 --> 18:44.433
or do you do other things?

18:44.433 --> 18:46.133
We actually have a
lot of different jobs.

18:46.133 --> 18:47.633
We have a lawyer, a stunt man.

18:47.633 --> 18:50.567
I'm actually a high school
math teacher, so...

18:50.567 --> 18:52.100
Wow.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.100
If you were my math teacher,
I wouldn't be here.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.133
I'd be working for Apple or something.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.667
So this is like your passion project,
side thing?

19:02.667 --> 19:04.033
We still need to pay the bills,

19:04.033 --> 19:06.667
but we're still chasing
the dream kind of thing.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.600
- See, I love that.
- I like that.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.467
There's an unbridled enthusiasm

19:12.467 --> 19:15.000
and passion that you have.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.533
It was why I wanted to be
involved in this whole thing

19:17.533 --> 19:21.500
because of routines like that,
because of dancers like you.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.967
I will say there was so much going on.

19:25.967 --> 19:28.000
Sometimes I didn't know where to look.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.400
But for the most part,
when you guys did lock in,

19:30.400 --> 19:32.467
it locked in like amazing.

19:32.467 --> 19:35.467
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

19:35.467 --> 19:36.867
Jennifer?

19:36.867 --> 19:41.700
- What, mama?
- I love you.

19:41.700 --> 19:44.133
Te quiero, los quiero, gracias.

19:46.933 --> 19:49.067
Let's hear what Derek has to say.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.333
Um, yeah, my biggest problem
was the song choice.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.067
I wasn't a big fan of the song choice.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.000
You know, um...

19:57.433 --> 20:01.133
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.600
It was so much fun,
so much energy.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.033
When you guys came on,
it was like bam,

20:04.033 --> 20:05.833
all right, these guys are ready to go.

20:05.833 --> 20:09.500
That's what this is all about,
is like confidence.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.233
I would say there was tricks
in there that I've seen before,

20:12.233 --> 20:13.467
but there was one trick in particular

20:13.467 --> 20:14.967
that I was really impressed with,

20:14.967 --> 20:17.233
that she kind of fell over
into like a cartwheel,

20:17.233 --> 20:19.033
and I was like, oh,
I wasn't expecting that,

20:19.033 --> 20:21.367
and that's what I love.
I love being surprised.

20:21.367 --> 20:23.167
I actually kind of wanted
more of that.

20:23.167 --> 20:24.733
So just remember that
if you make it through.

20:24.733 --> 20:27.000
Thank you. Thank you.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.433
There's this love for what
you do in every single move,

20:29.433 --> 20:32.567
but I kind of found myself
waiting on the trick.

20:32.567 --> 20:36.233
For me, the dynamics weren't
where I feel like this group

20:36.233 --> 20:39.733
has the potential to take them,
and I felt like it was good.

20:39.733 --> 20:42.367
It wasn't great for me,
but it was good, it was good.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.667
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

20:43.667 --> 20:46.733
It's time to lock in our scores.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.900
Thank you for being here.

21:21.067 --> 21:22.633
Next round, we're really
gonna step it up.

21:22.633 --> 21:23.733
Something new,
something exciting.

21:23.733 --> 21:25.067
We're going to work very hard

21:25.067 --> 21:26.500
because we were very close to that 80.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.567
Miami All Stars!

21:40.967 --> 21:42.967
Wow!

21:42.967 --> 21:45.467
It's going to take
that type of creativity

21:45.467 --> 21:48.033
to win this competition.

21:48.033 --> 21:49.467
Whoo!

21:49.467 --> 21:52.200
Good damn job.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.333
I sensed a little bit of nerves.

22:02.367 --> 22:03.936
Oh, my God, Derek,
you're such a good partner

22:03.967 --> 22:05.333
that I can already tell
in like one second, I'm like--

22:06.333 --> 22:08.900
I got you.

22:08.900 --> 22:09.900
Always.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.467
I'm so cold.

22:11.467 --> 22:12.967
I feel like a Chihuahua.

22:12.967 --> 22:15.033
Your hands are cold, so
they're not warming me up.

22:15.033 --> 22:17.000
I'm Luka, and I'm 19.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.633
I'm Jenalyn, I'm 16,
and we are from Toronto, Canada.

22:19.633 --> 22:22.067
And we do Cabaret ballroom dance.

22:22.067 --> 22:25.267
You would have absolutely
no idea by the way we dance,

22:25.267 --> 22:27.200
but we're actually complete opposites.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.033
Growing up, I did all kinds of sports.

22:30.033 --> 22:33.200
I was captain of the football team,
the basketball team.

22:33.200 --> 22:37.533
Apparently, I don't exactly come
across as a ballroom dancer.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.833
He is more of the expressive
and loud person.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.433
I'm more of the quiet bookworm.

22:42.433 --> 22:44.367
I'd always, like,
think to myself, like,

22:44.367 --> 22:46.367
how could we ever dance together?

22:46.367 --> 22:47.400
Like, how could this ever work?

22:47.400 --> 22:48.700
Because we were just so opposite.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.367
Don't give me that attitude.

22:51.367 --> 22:53.167
Soon enough, we grew on each other

22:53.167 --> 22:55.300
and it ended up working
for three years now.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.633
We're here working our butt off to--

22:57.633 --> 23:00.200
To kind of prove that, like,
anything is possible really,

23:00.200 --> 23:02.033
as long as you put your mind to it.

23:02.033 --> 23:03.933
- That was really cute.
- Aw, thanks.

23:03.933 --> 23:06.200
I'm sorry. That was just adorable.

23:06.200 --> 23:10.433
Please welcome Luka and Jenalyn.

23:16.433 --> 23:17.867
All right.

25:03.867 --> 25:06.600
I personally loved this performance.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.233
It was just sexy enough.
It was just technical enough.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.933
Song selection, that's honestly

25:13.933 --> 25:15.633
one of my favorite songs,
it really and truly is.

25:15.633 --> 25:17.533
- So great.
- I loved all the tricks.

25:17.533 --> 25:19.633
I was impressed.
I was impressed, great job.

25:19.633 --> 25:22.433
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

25:22.433 --> 25:25.800
All of us have been around the
dance world for so many years,

25:25.800 --> 25:27.867
so it's always nice when
two younguns come out

25:27.867 --> 25:29.667
and do some fresh
and exciting stuff.

25:29.667 --> 25:30.800
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.100
Thank you. This means a lot.

25:32.100 --> 25:34.733
So to me,

25:32.100 --> 25:34.733
that's the strongest part.

25:34.733 --> 25:37.500
Jenalyn, I think what's going
to take your performance

25:37.489 --> 25:41.784
to the next level is to really
listen and interpret the dance

25:42.533 --> 25:44.713
with the lyrics, with the music,

25:44.846 --> 25:45.767
with the feeling

25:45.767 --> 25:48.567
of the character that you're
playing within the dance,

25:48.567 --> 25:51.533
Like, you don't own me.
I needed him not to own you.

25:51.533 --> 25:53.800
He came out behind you--
like you didn't see it--

25:53.800 --> 25:55.700
but he came out,
he was like, "I own you."

25:55.700 --> 25:57.133
You know what I mean?

25:57.133 --> 25:58.867
I would've been like, oh.
You know what I'm saying?

25:58.867 --> 26:00.433
Yeah, I do, I do, I do.

26:00.433 --> 26:03.933
Those tricks, it was like
a lift trick clinic.

26:03.933 --> 26:06.367
You know, it was like, and
look at this one and this one,

26:06.367 --> 26:08.533
ba-ba, and the transitions
were seamless

26:08.533 --> 26:11.833
and very creative which made
them more interesting to watch.

26:11.833 --> 26:14.433
Luka, when you're on your own,
there was a moment

26:14.433 --> 26:16.333
where you like reached out to her,

26:16.333 --> 26:18.933
but that's exactly what it
felt like, it was like, hey.

26:18.933 --> 26:20.733
You know, I want to be like
bam, you know what I mean?

26:20.733 --> 26:23.900
Like, really--
you know, like, just--

26:23.900 --> 26:25.900
That's what I mean for her.

26:25.900 --> 26:28.100
The way you saw him,
that's how I saw her.

26:28.100 --> 26:29.500
- All right, will do.
- Okay.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.900
Thank you.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.067
All right, let's see if
you are going through.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.567
Whoo!

26:59.833 --> 27:01.567
Whoo!

27:01.567 --> 27:03.433
That's great.
I'm so proud of you.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.800
Okay, that was incredible.
Everyone was lit up.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.333
Everyone's freaking out,
but I gotta ask you.

27:07.333 --> 27:10.067
When Jennifer tells you
to stay more in character...

27:10.067 --> 27:11.533
I'm definitely going to work on it.

27:11.533 --> 27:12.900
Oh, my God, well I can't wait

27:12.900 --> 27:14.833
to see what more of this is going to be.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.167
That was amazing.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.233
- Congrats, you guys.
- Oh, thank you so much.

27:26.567 --> 27:27.958
Let's not be nervous.

27:29.467 --> 27:31.033
You're not nervous?

27:31.033 --> 27:32.600
I am.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.233
"The World of Dance"

27:34.233 --> 27:37.367
is basically the Super Bowl of dance.

27:37.367 --> 27:39.500
It's the best of the best.

27:45.100 --> 27:46.533
There was moments where I felt

27:46.533 --> 27:49.033
like you weren't connected
as I wanted you to be.

27:49.033 --> 27:51.833
You need to connect the heart,
almost a little bit more.

27:51.833 --> 27:53.833
I really enjoyed you guys
separately but together,

27:53.833 --> 27:55.600
it lacked just that partnership.

28:00.733 --> 28:04.233
They were good. They just
weren't a million dollars.

28:04.233 --> 28:08.267
One, two, three, move.

28:14.933 --> 28:18.100
There's a few little timing
issues, a little off-balance.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.800
I sensed a little bit of nerves.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.100
There's a lot of different styles

28:21.100 --> 28:22.467
incorporated into what you guys do,

28:22.467 --> 28:25.767
but it kind of felt like
a jack of all trades

28:25.767 --> 28:27.567
but a master of none.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.400
Let's do this, man.
Let's kill it.

28:41.567 --> 28:43.067
What you guys did was fantastic,

28:43.067 --> 28:44.433
especially for, like, your age,

28:44.433 --> 28:46.433
but the in-between moments,
the transitions,

28:46.433 --> 28:48.633
I felt like it kind of like
you lost the energy a little bit.

28:48.633 --> 28:51.300
You need a competition-winning routine.

28:51.300 --> 28:52.500
That's not easy.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.767
Cleanliness is super important.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.867
That's one thing that you guys
got to work on a little bit.

28:56.867 --> 28:59.233
It needs to be one mind,
one body, okay?

28:59.233 --> 29:00.733
All right, are we ready
to lock in scores, guys?

29:00.733 --> 29:01.833
- Yes.
- All right, here we go.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.733
Aww.

29:18.067 --> 29:20.000
They were good.
They just weren't all the way.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.967
Yeah.

29:21.967 --> 29:22.967
It's going to take more.
It's going to take more.

29:26.900 --> 29:31.033
We are a hip-hop crew
from Norway called Quick Style.

29:31.033 --> 29:34.733
Su and Bi, they're twins,
and when we met the first time

29:34.733 --> 29:36.567
when we were around
12 years old,

29:36.567 --> 29:41.733
we figured out that we had
the same interests in music.

29:41.733 --> 29:43.467
Dance is not a big thing in Norway.

29:43.467 --> 29:46.667
It's very rare for men to be dancing.

29:46.667 --> 29:48.633
When we started dancing,
we were too scared

29:48.633 --> 29:51.300
to show mom and dad,

29:51.300 --> 29:54.867
so we would say that we would go
play soccer and we would go out

29:54.867 --> 29:58.500
and we would take the subway
to town and dance.

30:00.733 --> 30:03.033
We've made a name for ourself in Norway.

30:03.033 --> 30:04.667
Winning "Norwegian Got Talent,"

30:04.667 --> 30:07.467
the biggest competition in Norway.

30:07.467 --> 30:10.433
Still Norway is so small.

30:10.433 --> 30:14.067
Like we've been kind of isolated
from America.

30:14.067 --> 30:16.000
This circle represents Norway.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.100
We're big fish in this little pond,

30:18.100 --> 30:21.267
and this is the ocean
with sharks everywhere.

30:21.267 --> 30:23.033
That's scary.

30:23.033 --> 30:24.733
I've actually watched a couple
of your videos,

30:24.733 --> 30:27.167
and I don't understand how
you move that quick and that clean.

30:27.167 --> 30:29.867
I'm so excited for them to see
you out there, because I know

30:29.867 --> 30:31.600
that they're going to go
like this, boom.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.300
- Bring it in.
- Thank you.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.867
Hopefully they won't expect
what we will be doing.

30:36.867 --> 30:40.233
- Mm.
- You got this. Whoo!

30:40.233 --> 30:44.167
From Oslo, Norway, it's Quick Style.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.200
Don't let the crowd psych
you out, come on.

32:31.767 --> 32:35.333
Quick Style, the musicality,

32:35.333 --> 32:37.967
the choreography, the creativity,

32:37.967 --> 32:40.067
I mean, it was all there,
and the song choice,

32:40.067 --> 32:41.600
if you were to say that
you guys were going to be

32:41.600 --> 32:44.700
dancing to Dolly Parton
and doing that style of dancing,

32:44.700 --> 32:46.133
I'm like, uh...

32:46.133 --> 32:49.200
So good. It was risky,
but man, did it pay off?

32:49.200 --> 32:51.000
Why did you guys want
to enter this competition?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.567
We're from Norway.

32:53.567 --> 32:56.767
And we've been dancing
together for 12 years.

32:56.767 --> 32:59.867
When we heard "World of Dance"
is going on,

32:59.867 --> 33:02.467
and it's going to be
the biggest dance competition,

33:02.467 --> 33:04.033
we had to be here.

33:04.033 --> 33:06.067
I felt that, I felt your
connection with each other.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.467
You connected with the audience.

33:07.467 --> 33:10.600
- I loved you guys.
- Thank you so much.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.133
If there's more than
one person on stage,

33:12.133 --> 33:14.067
then it needs to feel like
there's one person on stage.

33:14.067 --> 33:15.700
You all have to share
the same body.

33:15.700 --> 33:19.867
It has to be the same brain,
and y'all definitely have that.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.700
But should you guys make it through,

33:21.700 --> 33:24.567
I'd like to see more dynamics from you,

33:24.567 --> 33:25.933
those wow moments.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.933
I really, really enjoyed you.
I thought you guys were probably

33:30.933 --> 33:34.300
one of the cleanest of the groups
that I've seen.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.900
Really, really in sync.

33:35.900 --> 33:38.000
You weren't just in sync physically.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.300
You were in sync emotionally.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.300
That's the most important thing for us.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.567
Even the song you chose.

33:42.567 --> 33:44.600
It's going to take
that type of creativity,

33:44.600 --> 33:46.300
that type of innovation,

33:46.300 --> 33:49.433
to win this competition,
to win that million dollars.

33:50.833 --> 33:52.100
- All right, shall we lock it in?
- Let's lock it in.

33:52.100 --> 33:54.033
Let's do it.

34:04.867 --> 34:07.367
All right, let's see if
you guys are going through.

34:26.632 --> 34:29.933
That was amazing!

34:29.933 --> 34:33.699
Oh, you guys, okay, tell me,
tell me, who picked that song?

34:33.699 --> 34:35.067
- It was me.
- It was you?

34:35.067 --> 34:36.766
- Do you love Dolly Parton?
- Yeah.

34:36.766 --> 34:38.433
We've never danced
to a country song before.

34:38.433 --> 34:39.766
Yeah.

34:39.766 --> 34:41.233
So, this is totally out
of our comfort zone.

34:41.233 --> 34:43.000
I want to know what
your comfort zone is, because--

34:43.000 --> 34:44.300
That's what we want to show next time.

34:44.300 --> 34:47.567
I cannot wait.
I am your biggest fan.

34:47.567 --> 34:49.400
Everybody's been so good today,

34:49.400 --> 34:50.766
that it's still like--

34:50.766 --> 34:53.100
it's not gonna be
a landslide win for anybody.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.667
I love that. I love that aspect of this.

34:59.533 --> 35:01.633
It's overwhelming to watch your technique

35:01.633 --> 35:04.100
and how perfect, it's excellence.

35:12.033 --> 35:16.300
All right, last one, here we go.

35:16.300 --> 35:18.100
You're going to be fantastic.

35:18.100 --> 35:19.433
- I'm ready.
- Give mother a hug.

35:19.433 --> 35:21.133
I love you.

35:21.133 --> 35:22.700
My name is Nick Daniels,

35:22.700 --> 35:25.167
and I'm a contemporary dancer
from Miami, Florida.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.933
My mom owns a dance studio,
so I've always been

35:28.933 --> 35:31.867
dancing around
and watching everyone.

35:31.867 --> 35:36.667
Growing up, I tried all sports
and nothing really worked out.

35:36.667 --> 35:40.700
So, my parents decided that
I needed to do a dance class.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.933
My dad was literally at
every single recital,

35:42.933 --> 35:45.733
never missed one performance.

35:45.733 --> 35:47.333
Even though he would
sleep through

35:47.333 --> 35:49.133
some people's performances
but not mine.

35:49.133 --> 35:54.333
Having him by my side
really just boosted me up.

35:54.333 --> 36:00.800
When Nick was 13, Nick's dad got sick
and he had cancer.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.833
It was a while he had it,
but he would go to work still,

36:04.833 --> 36:06.967
he would still drive me everywhere.

36:06.967 --> 36:10.967
Like, I knew he had cancer but
I didn't know how severe it was.

36:10.967 --> 36:12.833
We were actually at a competition.

36:12.833 --> 36:15.133
My husband was in the hospital
and I got a call

36:15.133 --> 36:17.933
that he, um...

36:25.000 --> 36:27.833
I never got to talk to him again.

36:30.467 --> 36:35.767
And I think that he struggles
with that to this day.

36:35.767 --> 36:40.733
I wish that my dad would know
that I love him and miss him.

36:40.733 --> 36:44.000
Not only is today
the biggest performance

36:44.000 --> 36:45.867
of Nick's life,

36:45.867 --> 36:47.533
but it's Nick's dad's birthday.

36:47.533 --> 36:52.033
If Nick's dad was here,
he'd be his biggest cheerleader

36:52.033 --> 36:55.800
standing, screaming, telling
everybody, "That's my son."

36:55.800 --> 36:58.633
And even though he's not
standing next to me,

36:58.633 --> 37:00.800
I feel him in here.

37:02.833 --> 37:05.300
Every time I dance, I think of him.

37:05.300 --> 37:08.233
I just know that
he's watching over me,

37:08.233 --> 37:10.500
'cause he knows that
this is what I love.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.400
They're standing up for him.
They're standing up.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.500
Yes!

39:08.500 --> 39:10.333
Nick.

39:10.333 --> 39:11.800
Hey.

39:11.800 --> 39:16.567
I think we were all just
overwhelmed by your...

39:16.567 --> 39:19.033
- Flexibility. Ow!
- Yes.

39:19.033 --> 39:21.667
I was going to say the strength
that that takes.

39:21.667 --> 39:23.000
- Do you know what I mean?
- Oh, my God.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.233
It's overwhelming
to watch your technique

39:25.233 --> 39:27.833
- and how perfect its excellence.
- Thank you.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.533
And even in the moments
when you grabbed your head

39:30.533 --> 39:33.800
and you went crazy,
and I felt the frenzy

39:33.800 --> 39:36.100
of what you were trying
to say with your dance.

39:36.100 --> 39:38.267
We feel that emotion
when you let us in.

39:38.267 --> 39:41.633
Yeah.

39:41.633 --> 39:43.367
If I ever wanted to know

39:43.367 --> 39:46.533
what contemporary looked
like without the use of bones,

39:46.533 --> 39:50.400
I do now.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.900
That's why they call it
"the it factor,"

39:51.900 --> 39:53.900
because you can't really put
a finger on exactly what it is,

39:53.900 --> 39:56.267
however, I can put a finger
on the fact that you have it.

39:56.267 --> 39:57.700
You definitely have the it factor.

39:57.700 --> 39:59.433
Thank you.

39:59.433 --> 40:02.233
So I'm just going to say,
good damn job.

40:05.467 --> 40:07.633
I'm just curious.
What was the story of that?

40:07.633 --> 40:08.900
What was like the motivation?

40:08.900 --> 40:11.167
What was the thought
behind that dance?

40:11.167 --> 40:15.233
Well, about three years ago,
my dad passed away,

40:15.233 --> 40:19.733
and I felt like this dance
was dedicated to him like--

40:19.733 --> 40:21.933
like, just not like
being upset anymore

40:21.933 --> 40:24.467
and just releasing
like all the negativity

40:24.467 --> 40:26.567
it's brought to me.

40:27.600 --> 40:28.967
Thank you for telling me that,

40:28.967 --> 40:31.100
because now looking back
at the performance,

40:31.100 --> 40:33.800
I saw that sense
of letting something go.

40:37.900 --> 40:40.400
Your range of movement is endless.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.900
- Excellence.
- It's endless, and I'm like,

40:41.900 --> 40:44.000
whoa, he can do anything
with his body, it's crazy,

40:44.000 --> 40:45.867
but the parts that I liked the most,

40:45.867 --> 40:47.267
like, that I connected to the most,

40:47.267 --> 40:48.467
when you were just,
you like lost control,

40:48.467 --> 40:50.233
you're just kind of letting it go.

40:50.233 --> 40:51.600
It's like, wow, that stuff you can feel.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.733
- That's the magic.
- You feel that stuff.

40:53.733 --> 40:56.433
- Uh, yeah, I love you, man.
- Thank you.

40:57.833 --> 41:00.233
All right, it's time to lock in our scores.

41:06.333 --> 41:08.867
All right, let's see
if you're going through.

41:32.900 --> 41:36.133
- Good luck, brother.
- Thank you.

41:44.433 --> 41:48.100
Yes!

41:48.100 --> 41:51.700
- Oh, my goodness!
- Whoo!

41:51.700 --> 41:53.767
Oh, you couldn't have done that better.

41:53.767 --> 41:55.333
- Oh, that was incredible.
- Amazing, amazing.

41:55.333 --> 41:58.567
You made everyone feel
something so deep and amazing.

41:58.567 --> 41:59.800
- And thank you.
- Thank you.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.533
Thank you for that moment.

42:01.533 --> 42:03.367
I knew my dad was guiding me
through that performance,

42:03.367 --> 42:07.967
and I really wanted to show him
that I'm okay now.
