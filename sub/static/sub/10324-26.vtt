00:02.060 --> 00:04.420
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>A week ago, the show</i> Inside Probe...

00:04.530 --> 00:07.550
<i>aired part one of an investigation</i>
<i>they shot eight years back...</i>

00:07.660 --> 00:10.390
<i>about the disappearance</i>
<i>of Crab Shack owner Ernie Belcher.</i>

00:10.500 --> 00:13.300
It's on! The second part is really on!

00:13.400 --> 00:17.000
Hmm. I guess we <i>are</i> in the central time zone.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.230
Sorry for doubting you, Sam.

00:19.340 --> 00:23.800
Last week's episode of <i>Inside Probe</i>
was our highest rated ever.

00:23.910 --> 00:26.510
It seems all of America wanted to know...

00:26.610 --> 00:29.010
what happened to this man eight years ago-

00:29.120 --> 00:32.550
<i>Camden's popular restaurant owner</i>
<i>Ernie Belcher.</i>

00:32.650 --> 00:37.180
<i>It seemed like everyone we talked to</i>
<i>in the small town of Camden loved Ernie...</i>

00:37.290 --> 00:41.160
- <i>from dirtbags-</i>
- Everyone loved Ernie. He was funny.

00:41.260 --> 00:44.920
- <i>to the mentally disabled-</i>
- Ernie taught me how to tie my shoes.

00:45.030 --> 00:48.000
I've known him for a long time.
Almost two years.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.370
- <i>to coworkers-</i>
- Ernie was a genius.

00:50.470 --> 00:53.440
- <i>to hot women-</i>
- Ernie was cool.

00:53.540 --> 00:55.440
<i>To NASCARdrivers-</i>

00:55.540 --> 00:58.030
I met Ernie at a autograph signing,
and we just hit it off.

00:58.150 --> 01:01.380
- <i>and even a so-called celebrity.</i>
- I liked Ernie.

01:01.480 --> 01:05.710
<i>Ernie was a respected businessman</i>
<i>and beloved member of the community.</i>

01:05.820 --> 01:07.720
Or was he?

01:07.820 --> 01:12.020
Because on the warm summer night
of April 9, 2001...

01:12.130 --> 01:14.120
Ernie Belcher vanished.

01:14.230 --> 01:17.430
<i>But how could hejust evaporate</i>
<i>into thin air?</i>

01:17.530 --> 01:18.960
Was he murdered?

01:20.470 --> 01:22.960
The Camden police sure thought so.

01:23.070 --> 01:26.270
<i>And their investigation</i>
<i>led them to these two men.</i>

01:26.370 --> 01:29.540
<i>Angry letters from Randy Hickey</i>
<i>found in Ernie's office...</i>

01:29.640 --> 01:31.580
<i>uncovered a motive for murder.</i>

01:31.680 --> 01:35.110
<i>[Randy's Voice]</i>
<i>How dare you stop providing free toothpicks?</i>

01:35.220 --> 01:39.850
<i>How dare you only serve my favorite item-</i>

01:39.950 --> 01:43.080
<i>fish wings- on "Wenedsdays"?</i>

01:43.190 --> 01:46.060
<i>[Geraldo Narrating] Had Randy Hickey</i>
<i>murdered Ernie in his outrage...</i>

01:46.160 --> 01:49.220
<i>over the lack of toothpicks</i>
<i>and fish wings in the Crab Shack?</i>

01:49.330 --> 01:51.920
- <i>The Camden police sure thought so.</i>
- [Squealing]

01:52.030 --> 01:54.190
<i>And after 24 hours of interrogation...</i>

01:54.300 --> 01:56.900
<i>they had a forced confession to prove it.</i>

01:57.000 --> 01:58.970
Then we did it! We killed Ernie!

01:59.070 --> 02:02.470
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>Randy Hickey, town simpleton, had confessed.</i>

02:02.580 --> 02:06.570
<i>He and his brother, Earl,</i>
<i>were notorious lowlifes in Camden.</i>

02:06.680 --> 02:10.410
And the arrest sent the town of Camden
into virtual chaos.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.280
I'm freaking out.

02:13.390 --> 02:15.290
I've seen those boys.

02:15.390 --> 02:17.720
The dancers at the club
call them "Mustache" and "B.O."

02:17.830 --> 02:20.120
I call them "B.O. One" and "B.O. Two."

02:20.230 --> 02:23.860
The fact that they murdered someone
is the least of their problems.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.930
I hope those Hickey boys fry for what they did.

02:27.030 --> 02:29.560
I'm gonna miss Ernie. He was a gentleman.

02:29.670 --> 02:31.570
I remember one time...

02:31.670 --> 02:35.040
I was performing a sexual act on him,
and it started to rain...

02:35.140 --> 02:39.040
and he held his shirt out over my head
so my hair wouldn't get wet.

02:39.150 --> 02:43.640
[Chuckles] Oh, made me feel
a little bit like a princess.

02:43.750 --> 02:47.550
<i>[Geraldo Narrating] And with the cheapest</i>
<i>lawyer in town at their side...</i>

02:47.650 --> 02:50.450
- <i>it wasn't looking good for the Hickey brothers.</i>
- Oh.

02:50.560 --> 02:55.820
But the Hickey brothers were provided
with an alibi from a reliable witness...

02:55.930 --> 02:59.230
<i>two-time Daytona 500 winner</i>
<i>Michael Waltrip...</i>

02:59.330 --> 03:03.960
<i>whose testimony counts for as much</i>
<i>as three regular Americans.</i>

03:04.070 --> 03:07.560
<i>Fortunately for those guys, I'm a bit of</i>
<i>a shutterbug, and I had my camera with me.</i>

03:07.670 --> 03:10.470
<i>I got a pretty complete record</i>
<i>of what happened that night.</i>

03:12.080 --> 03:15.480
The police were stymied
and gave up their case.

03:15.580 --> 03:19.580
How is it possible that Ernie Belcher
could simply disappear?

03:19.690 --> 03:22.620
<i>Inside Probe</i> decided to dig...

03:22.720 --> 03:25.780
a little deeper... into the Earth...

03:25.890 --> 03:27.990
to find the treasure chest...

03:28.100 --> 03:30.690
of the truth... of this mystery.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.700
Tonight on <i>Inside Probe.</i>

03:32.800 --> 03:35.600
<i>## [Theme]</i>

03:50.650 --> 03:53.180
<i>My name is Earl.</i>

03:55.720 --> 03:58.020
I can't wait to find out who killed Ernie.

03:58.130 --> 04:01.190
I'm just glad it wasn't me. Although that
would've been an awesome twist...

04:01.300 --> 04:03.290
'cause I've always thought
I was such a nice guy.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.060
I bet it was the Cheese Grater Killer that got Ernie.
Remember that time in the parking lot...

04:07.170 --> 04:09.860
we found that big pile of ground beef
with the sock in it?

04:09.970 --> 04:14.270
I hope that wasn't Ernie, 'cause I ate that.
And I'm wearing that sock.

04:14.370 --> 04:16.140
[Darnell]
We don't even know if he's dead.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.240
It could be a perfectly normal thing, like
the government forced him to leave town...

04:19.350 --> 04:21.310
change his identity, marry a hot blonde.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.750
Who marries a hot blonde
and doesn't brag about it?

04:23.850 --> 04:26.110
I mean, you get a trophy,
you put it on a shelf.

04:26.220 --> 04:28.120
Ernie was our friend.

04:28.220 --> 04:31.490
If he was still alive, he would've found
a way to get in touch with us.

04:31.590 --> 04:34.060
And if all he did was move away,
he would've said good-bye.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.060
I'm sticking with the Cheese Grater.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.730
So once it was established that
the Hickey boys were not responsible...

04:40.830 --> 04:44.100
which came as a shock
to everyone here at <i>Inside Probe...</i>

04:44.200 --> 04:47.540
our investigation moved on
to something a little more...

04:47.640 --> 04:49.580
out of this world.

04:50.780 --> 04:55.840
Well, Randy's got an interesting hypo- poth-

04:55.950 --> 05:00.250
<i>uh, hyp- uh-hypo... thesis.</i>

05:00.350 --> 05:02.290
A-A theory.

05:02.390 --> 05:05.520
Aliens, from outer space.

05:05.630 --> 05:09.030
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>Stories of alien abduction are nothing new.</i>

05:09.130 --> 05:13.620
<i>Even cavemen recorded</i>
<i>these primitive drawings of the phenomena.</i>

05:13.730 --> 05:15.630
<i>[Earl]</i>
<i>You can ask my wife all about it.</i>

05:15.740 --> 05:18.860
She saw some sort of alien thing,
right on that very night.

05:20.310 --> 05:22.280
That's a great 'stache, by the way.

05:22.380 --> 05:24.210
Do you put some kind of conditioner on that?

05:24.310 --> 05:26.640
Yes, but it's very expensive.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.580
<i>It was this strange whooshing noise,</i>
<i>then a loud boom.</i>

05:29.680 --> 05:31.650
Then I saw these amazing lights.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.720
For a minute there, I thought it was Jesus.

05:33.820 --> 05:37.350
But then why wouldn't he just say, "Hey, Joy.
What's up?" So it must've been aliens.

05:37.460 --> 05:39.430
<i>Yeah, I was coming out of the Crab Shack...</i>

05:39.530 --> 05:42.090
<i>fixing to sell Wilfrid Dierkes</i>
<i>some muscle relaxants...</i>

05:42.200 --> 05:44.220
<i>which were reallyjust</i>
<i>leftover birth control pills...</i>

05:44.330 --> 05:48.320
<i>when we were both awestruck</i>
<i>by this blinding light from above.</i>

05:50.170 --> 05:54.040
<i>[Geraldo Narrating] While officially</i>
<i>the police discounted the alien theory...</i>

05:54.140 --> 05:58.440
<i>there was one officer</i>
<i>who had a different point of view.</i>

05:59.710 --> 06:01.650
<i>[Stuart]</i>
<i>I remember that night well.</i>

06:01.750 --> 06:04.050
Earlier, the captain
was giving out assignments...

06:04.150 --> 06:06.590
and one of us had to go investigate...

06:06.690 --> 06:11.650
some sort of underground gay
homosexual party at the park.

06:11.760 --> 06:16.220
And I drew the long straw,
so I was forced to do it.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.700
Isn't it usually the short straw that loses?

06:18.800 --> 06:21.270
No. It's the long straw.
The long straw loses.

06:24.810 --> 06:27.830
- <i>## [Dance]</i>
- <i>We set up some surveillance cameras</i>
<i>ahead of time.</i>

06:27.940 --> 06:32.810
<i>And then, to make sure that I would blend in</i>
<i>with the gay-sexuals, I went undercover.</i>

06:36.180 --> 06:38.710
<i>Nothing criminal seemed to be going on.</i>

06:38.820 --> 06:41.720
<i>Just a lot of well-built men</i>
<i>letting off some steam.</i>

06:41.820 --> 06:46.490
<i>And then I ended up being</i>
<i>the meat in a dance sandwich.</i>

06:46.590 --> 06:48.490
<i>It was terrible.</i>

06:48.600 --> 06:51.260
Where'd you get that shirt?

06:51.370 --> 06:55.030
<i>To stay in character was one of the toughest</i>
<i>professional challenges of my career.</i>

06:55.140 --> 06:56.800
Whoo!

06:56.900 --> 07:01.070
<i>Then suddenly, there were</i>
<i>these incredibly bright lights in the sky.</i>

07:01.170 --> 07:03.570
<i>I didn't know what to think.</i>

07:03.680 --> 07:06.480
One of the guys said
it was like being at a Cher concert...

07:06.580 --> 07:11.310
but all I could think was... U.F.O.'s.

07:11.420 --> 07:14.050
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>Aliens were spotted all over Camden...</i>

07:14.150 --> 07:18.420
<i>including at the Crab Shack,</i>
<i>the night of Ernie's disappearance.</i>

07:18.530 --> 07:22.260
<i>I remember that night.</i>
<i>I was working on the Crab Shack bathroom.</i>

07:22.360 --> 07:24.330
I had just finished pouring
the new cement floor...

07:24.430 --> 07:27.490
<i>and I was heading out to my truck,</i>
<i>when I saw the flash in the sky.</i>

07:27.600 --> 07:29.500
<i>It about blinded me, and I was, like, "Whoa!</i>

07:29.600 --> 07:32.660
I need to get some Radnor 6400
welding goggles."

07:34.710 --> 07:36.440
You know what I'm saying?

07:36.540 --> 07:38.440
I saw a U.F.O. Once.

07:38.550 --> 07:40.600
It was like a big, silver football.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.240
It was from the planet Goodyear.

07:43.350 --> 07:45.320
See, I tried to shoot it down...

07:45.420 --> 07:49.050
but their force field technology
must have been too strong.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.120
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>It turns out that in Camden...</i>

07:51.220 --> 07:54.660
<i>it's harder to find someone</i>
<i>who had</i> not <i>seen a U.F. O...</i>

07:54.760 --> 07:56.960
- <i>than somebody who had.</i>
- Next!

07:57.060 --> 07:59.760
Oh, I believe in alien life.

07:59.870 --> 08:02.430
I've seen some freaky-deaky things in my day.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.830
And just when you think you've seen it all...

08:04.940 --> 08:07.300
along comes a guy with a green wiener.

08:07.410 --> 08:09.310
Explain that.

08:09.410 --> 08:11.310
[Whispers]
Aliens.

08:11.410 --> 08:14.440
Listen, don't believe too much
of what you hear around here.

08:14.550 --> 08:16.520
Forty percent of the town,
including the mayor...

08:16.620 --> 08:18.980
claim they've seen a leprechaun in the woods.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.990
Trust me, Ernie wasn't abducted by aliens.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.150
But I'll tell you what I think
happened to him-

08:23.260 --> 08:25.350
<i>[Geraldo Narrating]</i>
<i>What was Darnell Turner about to say...</i>

08:25.460 --> 08:29.360
<i>before we realized this would be</i>
<i>a good dramatic breaking point?</i>

08:29.460 --> 08:33.190
If it wasn't a U.F.O. That took Ernie,
then where is he?

08:33.300 --> 08:37.790
Is it possible that Ernie's disappearance
is a result of the Civil War?

08:37.900 --> 08:41.140
We'll stick the probe even deeper inside...

08:41.240 --> 08:43.210
when <i>Inside Probe</i> returns.

08:44.850 --> 08:47.370
What in the hell were you about to say?

09:05.600 --> 09:08.690
Darnell, what were you
about to say on that TV show?

09:12.510 --> 09:14.800
[Swallows]
I don't remember what I said.

09:14.910 --> 09:17.670
Eight years is a long time ago.

09:17.780 --> 09:20.580
## [Theme]

09:20.680 --> 09:24.880
The mystery of Ernie Belcher's disappearance
was raising more questions than answers.

09:24.990 --> 09:27.510
- Was it murder?
- <i>[Gunshots]</i>

09:27.620 --> 09:30.590
Was it alien abduction?

09:30.690 --> 09:34.790
Or could it have been something
of historic proportion?

09:34.900 --> 09:37.690
- <i>## [Banjo]</i>
- History.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.860
During the Civil War,
Camden County was reluctant...

09:39.970 --> 09:42.060
to make a commitment
to either the North or the South...

09:42.170 --> 09:44.260
so they decided to create
a neutral country of their own...

09:44.370 --> 09:47.340
<i>a tiny nation they would call "the Central."</i>

09:47.440 --> 09:49.570
<i>Even though it happened</i>
<i>over a hundred years ago...</i>

09:49.680 --> 09:51.640
Ernie was profoundly loyal to the Central.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.710
He even flew the Central flag on the roof.

09:53.810 --> 09:57.770
Central is number one!
Central is number one! Whoo!

09:57.880 --> 10:03.450
My great-great-great-great-great-

10:03.560 --> 10:05.750
Wait, that's too many.

10:05.860 --> 10:08.950
He was my great-great-

10:09.060 --> 10:12.120
Anyway, he was around during the Civil War...

10:12.230 --> 10:14.290
and- and he led the Central.

10:14.400 --> 10:19.030
<i>[Geraldo Narrating] General Jefferson</i>
<i>Washington Hickey, leader of the Central.</i>

10:19.140 --> 10:21.270
<i>[Man's Voice]</i>
<i>We shall not be forced to pick sides...</i>

10:21.370 --> 10:23.570
<i>between the North's industrial economy...</i>

10:23.680 --> 10:26.080
<i>or the South's tradition of slavery.</i>

10:26.180 --> 10:28.650
<i>We deserve and demand and shall have both.</i>

10:28.750 --> 10:30.720
<i>[Crowd Cheering]</i>

10:30.820 --> 10:35.120
It's sad, you know,
'cause my great-great whatever-

10:35.220 --> 10:38.520
<i>Hejust wanted to get the North and South</i>
<i>to come to an agreement.</i>

10:38.630 --> 10:41.460
<i>[Geraldo Narrating] And the North and South</i>
<i>did come to an agreement...</i>

10:41.560 --> 10:44.330
<i>that they needed to massacre the Central.</i>

10:44.430 --> 10:48.300
The Central was formed
at 3:30 on March 10, 1861.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.700
By 3:45, it was gone.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.970
Like I said, Ernie insisted on flying the flag
of the Central on the Crab Shack roof...

10:54.070 --> 10:56.510
even though some people thought it was
an embarrassment to the town's history.

10:56.610 --> 10:58.510
It's not an embarrassment.

10:58.610 --> 11:01.780
When the Civil War II starts,
the Central will rise again.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.040
Rise again!

11:05.150 --> 11:08.350
People get pretty worked up.

11:08.460 --> 11:12.320
If you really wanna talk to somebody
about Central pride, you should talk to Ernie.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.190
Oh, he-he's missing, isn't he?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.320
That-That's the whole reason you're here.

11:18.430 --> 11:21.700
I just got carried away
with all that Central stuff.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.740
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Earl Hickey!</i>

11:23.840 --> 11:27.710
Hey, man. Can't you see
I'm doing an interview with Gerardo?

11:27.810 --> 11:29.740
Sorry 'bout that.

11:29.840 --> 11:34.010
So, was it overzealous loyalty
that led to the end of Ernie?

11:34.110 --> 11:36.080
Or was it something darker?

11:36.180 --> 11:40.640
Could it have been Ernie's involvement
in the world of underground kinky sex?

11:40.750 --> 11:43.880
[Gasping]

11:43.990 --> 11:45.890
I'd bet on the sex.

11:45.990 --> 11:49.890
He had a Internet business that catered
to clientele of straight-up freaks.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.020
Just how freaky was Ernie Belcher?

11:53.130 --> 11:56.100
Pretty freaky. We will be right back.

11:59.940 --> 12:02.200
All right, everybody.
I got $20 that Ernie was that torso...

12:02.310 --> 12:04.280
they found floating in the Camden swamp.

12:04.380 --> 12:07.680
I got 20 that he was torn to shreds
by that half-dog, half-coyote...

12:07.780 --> 12:09.750
that hangs out behind the truck stop.

12:09.850 --> 12:11.870
You think Dog-ote did it?

12:11.990 --> 12:14.450
You can't take bets
on what happened to Ernie.

12:14.550 --> 12:18.620
Why not? We took bets on what was wrong
with that blue kid we found at the park.

12:18.730 --> 12:22.680
But this is different. Ernie was a friend.
He was part of our everyday lives.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.730
L-I don't know about you guys,
but that matters to me.

12:25.830 --> 12:28.430
Hush up, princess. It's coming back on.

12:30.340 --> 12:32.800
If Ernie Belcher's mysterious disappearance...

12:32.910 --> 12:36.310
was not a result of anti-Centralist zealotry...

12:36.410 --> 12:39.740
could it be because
this pillar of the community...

12:39.850 --> 12:42.370
<i>had a secret, darker side?</i>

12:42.480 --> 12:44.450
<i>For anyone out there who is not aware...</i>

12:44.550 --> 12:47.920
<i>of the vast array of pornography</i>
<i>on the Internet...</i>

12:48.020 --> 12:50.550
<i>you're about to become far less productive.</i>

12:50.660 --> 12:55.490
Ernie had a little side business where he shot
fetish videos and sold 'em on his Web site.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.050
I starred in some.
Made a little money on the side.

12:59.170 --> 13:01.130
It got a little weird.

13:01.230 --> 13:03.790
<i>## [Disco]</i>

13:05.970 --> 13:08.440
- Who's been a bad boy?
- Me. Right-Right here.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.480
I've- I've been a bad boy.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.110
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep...

13:15.220 --> 13:17.120
yep, yep, yep, yep, yep...

13:17.220 --> 13:18.980
yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.280
Yeah, I was in some of Ernie's videos.

13:21.390 --> 13:24.750
He told me I could have
all the free crabs I could eat forever.

13:24.860 --> 13:26.830
Of course, Ernie's missing now...

13:26.930 --> 13:31.060
and apparently he never told anyone else
who works here about it!

13:31.160 --> 13:33.630
So I'm a little pissed about that.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.770
- <i>## [Instrumental]</i>
- [Sniffs]

13:37.870 --> 13:39.770
Oh, man.

13:39.870 --> 13:44.210
It's a size 11 from, like, 1988.

13:44.310 --> 13:48.370
And look,
it's filled with macaroni and cheese.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.780
This is gonna be <i>so</i> good.

13:55.220 --> 13:57.120
Mmm.

13:57.220 --> 14:00.520
Wow, this <i>is</i> good.
Do I really get to eat the whole shoe full?

14:00.630 --> 14:04.360
No, I didn't appear
in any of Ernie's sex videos.

14:08.670 --> 14:10.970
<i>[Man, Low Voice]</i>
<i>Are you pretty?</i>

14:11.070 --> 14:13.040
Yes, I'm pretty.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.480
[Quiet Sobbing]

14:20.910 --> 14:23.680
Yeah, I did some kinky videos for Ernie.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.880
I mean, how often is it
that you get to work with a real TV star?

14:27.990 --> 14:30.890
[Gurgling]

14:30.990 --> 14:33.080
[Grunting]
Nice.

14:33.190 --> 14:37.430
I don't remember doing any fetish videos.

14:37.530 --> 14:41.760
Of course, I'm told I was on a show called
<i>Parker Lewis Can't Lose</i> for three years...

14:41.870 --> 14:44.030
and I don't remember that either.

14:44.170 --> 14:47.230
Can you think of anyone involved in this
who might have wanted Ernie gone?

14:47.340 --> 14:51.440
Oh, hell. Anybody who might've found out
about his hidden cameras in the bathroom.

14:51.540 --> 14:54.910
- What?
- He had secret hidden cameras
all over the women's bathroom.

14:55.010 --> 14:57.210
When I found out,
I almost killed him my own self.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.050
Why didn't you say anything
about this before?

14:59.150 --> 15:03.090
He paid me off not to tell the other girls.
That's why I always peed in the alley.

15:03.190 --> 15:05.920
- Can you show me?
- Well, I don't really have to go right now.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.690
But if you buy me a beer,
I'll see what I can work up.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.700
- I meant, can you show me the hidden cameras?
- Oh.

15:13.430 --> 15:15.700
Well, buy me a beer, and I'll show you.

15:15.800 --> 15:20.100
<i>Inside Probe</i> went to work
and found all of Ernie's hidden cameras.

15:21.210 --> 15:23.370
Yep. They're all still here.

15:23.480 --> 15:28.470
There's overheads one, two, three.

15:28.580 --> 15:31.880
Then there's the behind-the-mirror cam.

15:36.390 --> 15:38.360
And the pee-pee cam.

15:39.690 --> 15:43.650
And we probed a little deeper
and found something else.

15:46.770 --> 15:49.790
- [Beeps]
- [Mechanism Whirring]

15:55.210 --> 15:58.510
A videotape, just as I suspected.

15:58.610 --> 16:01.840
Could Ernie's sick, perverted,
hidden bathroom tapes...

16:01.950 --> 16:04.510
finally shed some light on his disappearance?

16:04.620 --> 16:07.020
<i>Sure, there were innocent things...</i>

16:07.120 --> 16:11.320
<i>like a drunken Randy Hickey</i>
<i>stealing tampons and sanitary napkins.</i>

16:11.420 --> 16:13.320
[Giggling]

16:13.430 --> 16:17.690
<i>A local stripper trying to hide</i>
<i>the shame ofher secret eating.</i>

16:19.230 --> 16:22.600
<i>A daytime prostitute having a working lunch.</i>

16:29.410 --> 16:31.670
<i>Earl Hickey hiding in the bathroom...</i>

16:31.780 --> 16:34.580
<i>after snatching a bottle ofbooze</i>
<i>from behind the bar.</i>

16:34.680 --> 16:38.620
<i>The hidden cameras even caught</i>
<i>an icon of American television...</i>

<i>putting on his game face.</i>

16:40.720 --> 16:42.880
Never show weakness. Never show weakness.

16:42.990 --> 16:45.510
You're a rock star. You're Geraldo Rivera.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.220
This is what they pay you,
because you're worth it.

16:48.330 --> 16:50.590
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Someone's in here.</i>

16:50.700 --> 16:53.060
[High-pitched Voice]
It's not Geraldo.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.530
<i>Hidden cameras,</i>
<i>historical grudges, lights in the sky...</i>

16:58.640 --> 17:01.330
<i>a bathroom that was being remodeled.</i>

17:01.440 --> 17:03.570
<i>Four seemingly random events...</i>

17:03.680 --> 17:08.080
<i>until we revisited an interview we had done</i>
<i>with the black coworker...</i>

17:08.180 --> 17:12.050
<i>who, at the time, we assumed</i>
<i>was giving us a fake alibi.</i>

17:12.150 --> 17:14.780
<i>[Darnell] Every night at closing time,</i>
<i>I had to go up on the roof...</i>

17:14.890 --> 17:16.790
<i>to take down the flag of the Central...</i>

17:16.890 --> 17:19.080
<i>or else someone would snatch it</i>
<i>and destroy it.</i>

17:19.190 --> 17:21.180
<i>I saw some malcontent trying</i>
<i>to pull down the flag...</i>

17:21.290 --> 17:24.820
<i>and while I agreed with his sentiment,</i>
<i>it was my duty to protect Ernie's property.</i>

17:24.930 --> 17:27.400
<i>So I attacked him with lethal precision.</i>

17:27.500 --> 17:32.270
<i>He was a worthy opponent, and our fight</i>
<i>caused us to fall into the flagpole.</i>

17:32.370 --> 17:36.570
<i>The flagpole hit the power line,</i>
<i>and there was a pretty big explosion.</i>

17:36.680 --> 17:40.670
<i>[Geraldo Narrating] This would explain</i>
<i>the U.F.O. That several people saw that night.</i>

17:40.780 --> 17:44.410
And you might be asking,
what does any of this have to do with Ernie?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.420
Well, we're about to show you.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.460
<i>These were victim Ernie Belcher's</i>
<i>final moments.</i>

17:50.560 --> 17:53.220
<i>Here you see Ernie enter the bathroom.</i>

17:53.330 --> 17:57.090
<i>It's awkward</i>
<i>because he's avoiding the wet cement.</i>

17:57.200 --> 18:01.100
<i>He's presumably going to change</i>
<i>the tape in his hidden VCR...</i>

18:01.200 --> 18:05.260
<i>when suddenly he is startled</i>
<i>by a commotion on the roof.</i>

18:05.370 --> 18:09.970
<i>As the battle on the roof raged on,</i>
<i>the power went out...</i>

18:10.080 --> 18:14.310
<i>and, unable to see, Ernie lost his footing.</i>

18:14.410 --> 18:16.710
<i>And for the semiconscious Ernie Belcher...</i>

18:16.820 --> 18:21.780
<i>the harsh reality was sinking in.</i>

18:21.890 --> 18:24.080
As was his body.

18:27.530 --> 18:30.660
<i>[Crowd Murmuring]</i>

18:41.870 --> 18:44.780
Wow. I always thought

18:45.880 --> 18:47.570
<i>[Earl]</i>
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

18:47.680 --> 18:52.120
Ernie's been right here in the Crab Shack
for eight years, and nobody knew it.

18:52.220 --> 18:53.850
You know what's so funny?

18:53.950 --> 18:56.980
For years I've been using that thing
to clean gum off the bottom of my shoes.

18:57.090 --> 19:00.790
Well, Ernie, the Crab Shack
was always a part of you.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.420
Now you will always be
a part of the Crab Shack.

19:04.830 --> 19:07.630
We can finally give you a real good-bye.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.200
Good-bye, friend.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.470
You got a little-

19:14.640 --> 19:16.340
I got it.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.820
Well, boss...

19:23.920 --> 19:25.940
you died like a hero from the Central-

19:26.050 --> 19:28.850
quickly and in the bathroom.

19:31.460 --> 19:34.950
Later, Ernie.
Say hey to Grandma Nancy for me.

19:35.060 --> 19:38.090
Unless, by some miracle,
you ended up in heaven.

19:42.070 --> 19:43.970
Good-bye, pal.

19:44.070 --> 19:47.100
Just in case there's some chance that you're
alive down there, breathing through your nose...

19:47.210 --> 19:50.270
I want you to know
that I forgive you for the toothpicks...

19:50.380 --> 19:53.740
but I will never forgive you
for the fish wings.

19:53.850 --> 19:58.280
Shh.
