it might be one of the others.

[Murdock laughing]

20:35.296 --> 20:39.673
Why don't we get the van out of sight
before they spot it? And then...

20:40.176 --> 20:43.545
we'll all try and get our oars in the water...

20:43.804 --> 20:47.173
and we'll all try to stroke in unison.

20:47.266 --> 20:48.808

20:51.645 --> 20:53.887
Okay, guys. Push!

They will not, l repeat, not get away.

21:00.863 --> 21:02.986
l can't afford to strike camp now.

21:04.075 --> 21:07.989
We've got three teams out
covering this entire area here.

21:08.329 --> 21:11.495
They were in a van so they can't handle
any of the off-roading...

21:11.582 --> 21:13.160
which limits their possible routes.

21:13.250 --> 21:16.536
They obviousIy didn't know
the type of terrain they wouId encounter.

21:16.629 --> 21:19.914
Which makes me wonder,
just how they located us in the first place.

21:20.007 --> 21:23.008
-Somehow during the ransom pickup.
-Yes. Somehow.

21:23.094 --> 21:26.130
Too bad you were too busy
to have interfered with that attack.

RAMON: Enough, both of you!

whether they're found or not.

and cover the northern quadrant.

This is getting better by the moment.

21:57.962 --> 22:00.916
He is not a kidnapper.

22:01.006 --> 22:04.126
Marcus was my boyfriend
before this whole thing went down.

22:04.218 --> 22:06.507
Yeah, sure. He was a member of the GLA.

22:06.595 --> 22:09.003
JENNlFER: He believed in their philosophies.

22:09.098 --> 22:12.930
Their leader, Ramon, duped him
into bringing me along for the weekend...

22:13.018 --> 22:15.344
to see if l might understand
what they stood for.

22:15.438 --> 22:18.142
The next thing I knew, Ramon had me
under Iock and key...

22:18.232 --> 22:19.691

22:31.245 --> 22:33.403
JENNlFER: They used Marcus as a pawn.

22:33.497 --> 22:35.704
He just continued to play along with them...

22:35.791 --> 22:39.077

the kind of fanatic he was dealing with.

22:39.795 --> 22:40.993
Look.

22:41.213 --> 22:44.001
Ramon was already beginning to
suspect something.

22:45.259 --> 22:47.548
He's going to think
that Marcus helped me escape.

22:47.636 --> 22:50.210
Now, there's no telling
what they're gonna do to him.

22:50.306 --> 22:51.883
You have to get him out of there.

22:51.974 --> 22:55.177

is getting you back to your father.

-My father doesn't care about me.
-Look, lady...

22:58.189 --> 23:02.138
he went through an awful lot of trouble
and a lot of money, to get us to find you.

23:02.234 --> 23:05.520
Of course he did. What else is he gonna do?

23:05.613 --> 23:09.361
He can't have people thinking
that a big tycoon like Warren Teasdale...

23:09.450 --> 23:11.858
wasn't going to ransom his daughter back.

23:11.952 --> 23:15.452
Just wait until he finds out
that you guys didn't get the ransom back.

about the ransom money...

is safe and sound.

That was what the kidnappers took.

23:43.234 --> 23:47.018
-we did get you your daughter back.
-You said the money was just bait.

23:47.113 --> 23:49.734
The only reason l agreed to turn it over
was because...

23:50.074 --> 23:52.316
Smith said he would guarantee it personally.

to retrieve my daughter.

24:00.710 --> 24:02.417
TEASDALE: You Iost it.

24:02.503 --> 24:06.287

exceeds our negotiated fee...

for the difference.

KATHRYN: As long as they don't get back off
the grounds.

34:31.757 --> 34:33.299
They're to be stopped. No matter what.

34:33.384 --> 34:36.918
No matter who they have with them,
this time. ls that understood?

34:38.347 --> 34:40.340
You heard my second in command.

34:40.516 --> 34:41.761
LAURA: Ramon!

34:43.936 --> 34:46.474
They found something you should see.

34:46.605 --> 34:49.096
[Suspenseful instrumental music]

34:49.859 --> 34:52.527
[Fast-paced instrumental music]

35:22.725 --> 35:25.097
They never intended to take the Bronco.

35:25.394 --> 35:27.636
RAMON: They're heading for the north cliff.

36:15.361 --> 36:16.475
MARCUS: Your Colonel Smith.

36:16.570 --> 36:20.782
As long as there's gunfire, we know
he's still alive for them to be shooting at.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.728
[Dramatic instrumental music]

36:55.985 --> 36:57.396
[Murdock mumbling]

37:02.783 --> 37:03.898
What do we do now?

37:03.993 --> 37:07.611
-We proceed on schedule.
-What if Marcus tells them what he knows?

37:07.830 --> 37:10.403
There is no way
that they could get reinforcements...

37:10.499 --> 37:12.706
and be at the dam before we're gone.

37:12.835 --> 37:16.002
That means that it would just be
the four of them again.

37:16.964 --> 37:20.499
And that would be too bad for them.

37:29.101 --> 37:30.299
JENNlFER: You made it.

37:35.024 --> 37:38.227
-Honey, l was so worried about you.
-Me, too, girl.

37:39.612 --> 37:43.063
But you should have gotten out of here.
Not let them come back for me.

37:43.157 --> 37:46.608
We stand for truth, justice
and the American way.

37:46.702 --> 37:49.324
And if that means the kidnapper
gets the girl...

37:49.413 --> 37:51.205
well, we'll make that happen, too.

37:51.290 --> 37:54.873
B.A.: Even if it kills us.
JENNlFER: You guys are incredible.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.333
l can't believe that you actually did it.

37:57.421 --> 37:58.702
Neither can l.

37:59.090 --> 38:00.584
We lost our wheels...

38:00.883 --> 38:04.169
B.A. did 15 rounds with Godzilla.

38:04.261 --> 38:06.171
Hannibal did a 20-story high dive.

38:06.263 --> 38:09.099
We had our raft blown out from under us...

38:09.183 --> 38:13.263
and we still managed to save the girl,
her boyfriend and...

38:14.480 --> 38:15.855
retrieve the money.

38:15.940 --> 38:19.273
Now, all you've got to do is stop them
from blowing up that dam.

38:19.985 --> 38:21.100
Dam?

38:24.240 --> 38:25.817
l want to cry.

40:29.365 --> 40:30.907
They're on their way.

40:31.117 --> 40:33.608
l'll lock the gate and start the party.

40:34.537 --> 40:35.735
You know...

40:36.414 --> 40:39.249
l'm getting to love this bulletproof vest.

[Rhythmic instrumental music]

40:58.018 --> 40:59.928
[Murdock panting]

41:00.730 --> 41:03.684
This one here, it looks like
it's just about your size.

41:03.774 --> 41:08.021
lt's not exactly my idea
of what a well-dressed terrorist should wear.

41:08.195 --> 41:09.903
l'm gonna go get my gun.

41:10.573 --> 41:12.945
Then l'll catch you on the flip side.

41:16.912 --> 41:20.495
l'll go up to the catwalk over there
and locate the second guard.

41:22.251 --> 41:24.042
MURDOCK: Where am l supposed to go?

41:25.212 --> 41:28.297
-Who are you?
-You'd never believe it.

41:28.966 --> 41:30.959
Neat surprise, huh?

41:31.093 --> 41:34.427
MURDOCK: Put your guns down.
Put them down.

41:36.432 --> 41:37.630
Now move it.

42:07.546 --> 42:09.420
Put your weapons down.

42:13.761 --> 42:15.837
Get against the wall.

42:21.852 --> 42:24.937
You've got to be kidding.
My men are all over this place.

42:25.022 --> 42:26.137
HANNlBAL: Wrong.

42:26.357 --> 42:30.355
You had three on C level,
two by the sluice gates...

42:30.694 --> 42:32.936
and, if l'm not mistaken...

42:33.030 --> 42:36.399
here come the ones who were supposed to
take out interior security.

42:36.534 --> 42:40.033
Just like shooting pool, you take your time
and sink each ball.

42:40.121 --> 42:41.401
You forgot about this.

42:41.497 --> 42:43.157
KATHRYN: lt's set and you can't stop it.

42:43.249 --> 42:44.873
You've got less than 90 seconds.

42:44.959 --> 42:46.334
You're too Iate.

42:50.381 --> 42:53.050
She's right. lt's ticking.

42:53.175 --> 42:55.797
Face, Murdock, take care of them.

42:57.847 --> 42:59.222
FACE: Never-ending madness.

42:59.306 --> 43:02.806
What are you? A couple of fruit flies?
There are places for people like you.

for saving my daughter.

44:15.132 --> 44:16.840
l owe you even more.

44:17.134 --> 44:20.503
Marcus got a suspended sentence
and we can keep on seeing each other.

44:20.596 --> 44:22.719
That terrorist will never get a job.

44:22.807 --> 44:25.298
My daughter doesn't have a dime.
She'll do as l say.

44:25.393 --> 44:28.228
You shouldn't be too unhappy,
Mr. Teasdale, after all...

44:28.312 --> 44:32.310
all the rest of the terrorists are turning into
sharp cheddar cheese in jail.

44:32.400 --> 44:36.646
And Jennifer here can see Marcus
under more normal conditions.

Fair's fair in love and war and all that stuff.

44:40.533 --> 44:44.447
None of which tells me
where the money l entrusted to you went.

44:44.745 --> 44:46.702
You people are supposed to have answers.

We can't pull a rabbit out of the hat,
if the rabbit's jumped out of it.

44:51.001 --> 44:52.460
But it is ironic...

44:52.545 --> 44:55.462
that we brought
your daughter home safely...

44:55.673 --> 44:59.256
and you told us we did a sloppy job
and wouldn't get paid.

45:00.386 --> 45:02.295
And now, we can't find the money anywhere.

45:02.388 --> 45:03.668

l figured you'd do something like this.

45:15.860 --> 45:18.148
-That's Decker out there.
-Sure is.

45:18.237 --> 45:20.526
We got to pop a brodie and get moving.

45:21.240 --> 45:24.656
They'll never catch us, Mr. Teasdale.
And just so you know...

45:24.744 --> 45:26.119
we're like socks.

45:26.370 --> 45:30.747
You can put us through a rough wash once,
but you'll never use us again.

45:31.459 --> 45:33.617
-Good luck, Jennifer.
-Thanks.

45:36.380 --> 45:39.880
MURDOCK: You think he knows we put
the beans in the bank under her name?

45:39.967 --> 45:42.292
HANNlBAL: Minus our modest fee.
FACE: Very modest.

45:42.386 --> 45:43.762
HANNlBAL: She probably did.

45:44.638 --> 45:48.802
HANNlBAL: Just to pay him back,
for turning us in after we saved her life.

45:48.893 --> 45:51.466
This is almost perfect justice for him.

45:51.687 --> 45:53.644
Almost as if l planned it.
