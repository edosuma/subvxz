Not this time.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.639
Well, I think that I might.

39:11.807 --> 39:15.311
It's an idea that I've had for the ending
of my latest Caroline novel.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.396
Step in Time, Caroline?

39:17.480 --> 39:18.314
Yeah.

39:18.397 --> 39:21.359
I was hoping that I might run it by you.

39:21.859 --> 39:24.362
Actually, Simon, um...

39:24.445 --> 39:26.405
I need to talk to you, and it's--

39:26.489 --> 39:30.868
"He looked out at the water's edge,

39:30.951 --> 39:35.373
seeing her blond hair reflect
the last rays of light from the setting sun."

39:36.499 --> 39:38.584
Very pretty, but--

39:38.667 --> 39:42.296
"But he knew that it was time to leave.

39:43.464 --> 39:47.510
That their love was not destined
to stand the tests of time."

39:48.594 --> 39:50.763
You know me, I love clichés.

39:50.846 --> 39:53.099
Bread and butter of all hack novelists.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.643
[♪♪♪]

39:56.435 --> 39:59.897
"For although he loved her dearly,

40:00.898 --> 40:07.655
their time together was but a sonnet,
a minuet, a precious moment."

40:08.823 --> 40:09.865
Simon.

40:12.493 --> 40:15.079
Bree, I'm reading.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.250
"So he turned away...

40:20.960 --> 40:26.215
knowing that her love had changed him forever...

40:27.258 --> 40:32.096
and hoping that his love had done
the same for her."

40:34.849 --> 40:35.975
Yeah.

40:37.351 --> 40:40.312
I-- I don't know where I'd be if you hadn't--

40:40.396 --> 40:44.650
"He sees through her
to the point where she is invisible."

40:47.403 --> 40:48.279
Oh...

40:49.822 --> 40:53.242
I knew-- I knew that you were unhappy, Bree.

40:55.119 --> 40:58.789
But it would hurt me too much
to know that I'm responsible.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.304
-I'm so sorry.
-No. No.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.496
[♪♪♪]

41:56.430 --> 41:58.098
Oh, thank you.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.227
So I was wondering if I could make the toast.

42:01.310 --> 42:02.895
Oh, sure. Have at it.

42:04.647 --> 42:08.651
I have been in love only one time in my life,

42:08.734 --> 42:10.528
and it did not turn out well.

42:11.195 --> 42:14.156
No offense, Megan,
maybe I should do the toast next time.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.616
-I'm not finished.
-Oh.

42:16.659 --> 42:19.453
But I still care about that person.

42:20.621 --> 42:24.583
And I don't want to walk away
from what could be by fearing what was.

42:28.629 --> 42:33.175
I've hired a local harpist for the wedding
and talked to Sarah about the invitations.

42:35.803 --> 42:39.181
Oh, the O'Briens make everything complicated.

42:42.601 --> 42:43.644
Overly complicated.

42:44.436 --> 42:45.688
[GLASSES CLINK]

42:49.358 --> 42:53.654
TRACE: You should know, with Mark Hall,
take everything with a grain of salt.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.197
I kind of got that vibe.

42:55.281 --> 42:57.992
So, what'd he offer you?

42:58.075 --> 42:59.952
What most people would sell their soul for.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.663
Sounds about right.

43:03.831 --> 43:04.999
And?

43:05.082 --> 43:08.794
And I'm not ready. And I got this familiar feeling.

43:08.877 --> 43:11.714
Same one I got before I ditched
my boyfriend in Atlanta.

43:11.797 --> 43:13.757
You sign up, you lose control.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.135
Like switching out one bad relationship for another.

43:17.720 --> 43:21.265
You know, I don't feel that way with you.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.942

44:00.971 --> 44:02.973

44:30.250 --> 44:32.795
NARRATOR:
Next week on Chesapeake Shores:

44:32.878 --> 44:34.588
So the answer's still no?

44:34.672 --> 44:37.841
The answer has been no
since I walked off stage in Prague.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.427
-I was asking Emma.
ABBY: I have had enough real,

44:40.511 --> 44:42.888
between work and the ship and...

44:42.971 --> 44:44.515
-Trace?
JAY: The sets were destroyed.

44:44.598 --> 44:47.434
The school play is this week,
and two of my students said that you--

44:47.518 --> 44:49.895
Wait a sec. Carrie and Caitlyn Winters?

44:49.978 --> 44:51.814
Mick and I have to say something
to the kids, don't we?

44:51.897 --> 44:54.108
You already know the answer.

44:54.191 --> 44:55.609
We have an announcement to make.
