WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:02.541
Hey, guys.

00:02.575 --> 00:04.142
- Hey.
- Wow.

00:04.177 --> 00:06.811
- That smells great!
- Mmm!

00:06.829 --> 00:08.480
Hey, soccer champ.
What do you say we go outside

00:08.514 --> 00:11.783
and throw an American football
around a little before dinner?

00:11.818 --> 00:13.051
Nope.

00:13.085 --> 00:14.119
Nope?

00:14.153 --> 00:17.722
Look, can't I just enjoy my paper?

00:17.757 --> 00:18.990
Hoo-hoo!

00:19.008 --> 00:21.626
What's wrong with princess Leia?

00:21.661 --> 00:22.894
(Chuckles)

00:22.929 --> 00:25.797
You know that aisle
you avoid in the drugstore?

00:32.271 --> 00:33.905
<i>Wow.</i>

00:36.542 --> 00:39.861
That's a-- that's a big day, huh?

00:39.896 --> 00:43.681
Big change, huh?

00:43.699 --> 00:45.850
Don't have to be awkward
talking to me about it.

00:45.868 --> 00:49.421
You know, I've had a lot of
conversations with your sisters.

00:49.455 --> 00:51.423
Get <i>out.</i>

00:51.457 --> 00:53.692
Good talk.

00:55.495 --> 00:56.711
I am so psyched!

00:56.746 --> 00:58.497
Mom, Travis and I just booked tickets

00:58.531 --> 01:01.032
to the new Cirque Du Soleil
show, "Plinq."

01:01.067 --> 01:02.267
Plink?

01:02.301 --> 01:03.635
Yeah. With a "q."

01:03.669 --> 01:05.504
The entire stage is a piano

01:05.538 --> 01:06.905
played by French-Canadian clowns--

01:06.939 --> 01:09.941
oh, <i>pardon.</i> I mean <i>cloons.</i>

01:09.976 --> 01:12.260
Wow. Did I hear "clowns,"
"pianos," and "Canadians"?

01:12.311 --> 01:16.014
Yeah. That's like the hat
trick of misery right there.

01:16.048 --> 01:17.649
Hey, dad?

01:17.683 --> 01:19.601
Are you sure you don't mind
watching Boyd tonight?

01:19.652 --> 01:21.186
No. I love Boyd. Come here.

01:21.220 --> 01:23.221
Grandpa just wants to hold on
to you for just a second.

01:23.239 --> 01:24.723
Honey, here you go.

01:26.409 --> 01:27.993
I have a date with Kyle.

01:28.027 --> 01:31.162
Ah, good old reliable Kyle.
Can you be in by 12:00, please?

01:31.197 --> 01:33.198
I will not be in by 12:00.
I am 20 years old.

01:33.232 --> 01:34.199
Do you pay rent?

01:34.233 --> 01:36.067
- No.
- Do you live under my roof?

01:36.102 --> 01:37.586
- Yes.
- You'll be in by 12:00.

01:37.620 --> 01:38.637
Ugh!

01:40.339 --> 01:42.073
Will you just leave me
the sports section?

01:42.091 --> 01:43.508
Go away.

01:47.096 --> 01:48.380
(Chuckles)

01:49.682 --> 01:51.299
Can you fix this?

01:52.746 --> 01:55.196

(Gasps)

02:06.732 --> 02:09.484
- (Lowered voice) Kyle, what are you
doing here? - What am I doing here?

02:09.535 --> 02:10.702
What are you doing here?

02:10.735 --> 02:12.504
(Lowered voice) This is not
gonna look good.

02:12.538 --> 02:14.105
No, look, don't panic.
We didn't do anything.

02:14.123 --> 02:16.324
Still, I'm a little
gun-shy around your dad.

02:16.375 --> 02:17.325
Literally.

02:17.376 --> 02:19.210
He has a lot of guns.

02:19.245 --> 02:22.948
Keep your voice down. We will
sneak you down the stairs.

02:22.982 --> 02:24.583
- Okay.
- Kris, are you up?

02:24.617 --> 02:26.718
Crap! Quick!
Hide in the closet!

02:26.752 --> 02:28.219
Kristin?

02:28.254 --> 02:30.138
No. No! No...

02:32.224 --> 02:33.224
(Thud)

02:33.259 --> 02:34.960
Or do that.

02:34.994 --> 02:35.960
(Knock on door) (Gasps)

02:35.978 --> 02:38.096
Hey, Kris.
Hey, dad.

02:38.130 --> 02:40.632
Everything all right?
Yeah.

02:40.650 --> 02:42.133
I just wanted to let you know

02:42.168 --> 02:44.185
that Boyd was just a gem last night.

02:44.236 --> 02:45.804
Oh, great. Thanks.
What'd you guys do?

02:45.838 --> 02:48.106
Uh, well...
It's freezing in here, honey.

02:48.140 --> 02:49.858
Well, we ate a little bit,

02:49.909 --> 02:51.910
read some fishing magazines,
had some scotch.

02:51.944 --> 02:53.979
Ha! You or him?

02:54.013 --> 02:55.714
The point is,
he was out like a light.

02:55.748 --> 02:58.783
Say, Kyle didn't spend
the night, did he?

02:58.818 --> 03:00.719
What?
Why would you say that?

03:00.753 --> 03:03.171
Because he's limping
across the damn lawn.

03:06.676 --> 03:09.427
I don't--I don't think that's him.

03:09.462 --> 03:11.129
<i>Run, Kyle!</i>

03:13.766 --> 03:16.768
Looks like we had an unwanted
visitor in the house last night.

03:16.802 --> 03:20.839
Oh, honey, Eve is 13.
It's just simple biology.

03:20.873 --> 03:25.243
Ew. I'm not talking about <i>that.</i>

03:25.277 --> 03:27.078
Kyle spent the night.

03:27.113 --> 03:29.147
Does he want breakfast?

03:29.181 --> 03:30.649
Breakfast?

03:30.683 --> 03:33.184
Last time I saw him, he was
limping across the front lawn.

03:33.202 --> 03:34.202
Oh, okay. All right.
Just calm down.

03:34.236 --> 03:35.487
Why don't you calm up?

03:35.521 --> 03:37.355
You know what my parents
would have done to me

03:37.390 --> 03:38.823
if they caught me
with a girl in the house?

03:38.857 --> 03:40.258
They would have escorted her
out, shut the blinds,

03:40.292 --> 03:41.826
and pistol-whipped me.

03:41.860 --> 03:43.912
Oh, all right. Well,
let's call that plan "b."

03:43.963 --> 03:45.597
Well, we've got to do something!

03:45.631 --> 03:48.533
Stop. Just stop.
You can't control the world.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.719
From the mailbox
to my barbecue grill,

03:50.753 --> 03:52.737
- this is my domain. I <i>can</i> control this
world. - All right, all right. Look. Look.

03:52.772 --> 03:55.573
- I realize as a man, your instinct is to
take action. - This isn't about being a man.

03:55.608 --> 03:57.342
- Why do you bring this-- it has nothing about a--
- Yes, it is.

03:57.376 --> 03:58.893
- We have teenage daughters!
- One daughter in particular has a guy in her room!

03:58.928 --> 04:00.512
Listen to me--pretend
you're on a bomb squad.

04:00.546 --> 04:01.930
You gotta tread very lightly,

04:01.981 --> 04:04.482
or else you know
what's gonna happen? Kaboom!

04:04.517 --> 04:06.651
- That's not the right analogy.
- Yes, that is the right analogy.

04:06.686 --> 04:08.269
Bomb squads don't work like that.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.455
They get a safe zone,
then they get some protection,

04:10.489 --> 04:12.390
they go in there and they try
to detonate the damn thing.

04:12.425 --> 04:13.658
Oh, really? Really?

04:13.693 --> 04:14.892
That's the way
you're gonna deal with this?

04:14.910 --> 04:16.327
Yes, I'm gonna go find a mattress,

04:16.362 --> 04:19.363
some goggles, get a stick, start
poking people with something!

04:26.205 --> 04:27.756
Whatcha doing, Kyle?

04:27.790 --> 04:30.709
Just unloading these
multi-channel walkie-talkies.

04:30.743 --> 04:32.127
Mm-hmm.

04:32.178 --> 04:34.345
That's quite a limp
you have there, son.

04:34.380 --> 04:37.716
It's nothing.
I just sort of fell.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.268
Out a window.

04:40.302 --> 04:42.821
Onto a garden gnome.

04:42.855 --> 04:44.355
Ouch.

04:44.390 --> 04:47.525
Well, every limp has a story.
What's yours?

04:47.560 --> 04:50.028
Can you keep a secret?

04:50.062 --> 04:52.063
You know Denise in shipping?

04:52.098 --> 04:53.565
What about her?

04:53.599 --> 04:55.366
Exactly.

04:58.237 --> 05:00.505
Anyway...

05:00.539 --> 05:02.774
I, uh, I went out with
Mike's daughter last night,

05:02.792 --> 05:05.043
and I sort of stayed over.

05:05.077 --> 05:08.046
Oh-ho. I see.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.280
Does Mike know?

05:09.315 --> 05:10.281
I'm not sure.

05:10.316 --> 05:11.349
(Mike) Hey, Kyle!

05:11.383 --> 05:13.885
He knows.

05:13.919 --> 05:15.453
(Mike) Is Kyle down there?

05:15.488 --> 05:17.672
If you see him down there,
send him up here!

05:17.723 --> 05:20.341
Hey, Ed.
Hmm?

05:20.392 --> 05:21.593
Where's Kyle?

05:21.627 --> 05:24.028
He was here a moment ago. I...

05:24.063 --> 05:26.531
(Kyle, whispering) Ed. Is Mike there?

05:29.568 --> 05:31.669
(Normal voice) He's standing
right next to you, isn't he?

05:31.704 --> 05:32.854
Over.

05:34.507 --> 05:36.708
Where are you? Over.
(Beep)

05:36.742 --> 05:38.676
Nothing happened, sir.
We were just talking.

05:38.711 --> 05:41.279
It was her idea. Over.
(Beep)

05:42.915 --> 05:46.117
Kyle, listen to me.
I'm gonna hold your arms back,

05:46.152 --> 05:48.219
and Mike's gonna
punch you in the face.

05:48.254 --> 05:49.754
That's street rules.

05:49.789 --> 05:52.990
Then it'll be over. Over. (Beep)

05:53.008 --> 05:55.593
Uh... I don't want to be
punched in the face.

05:55.628 --> 05:58.530
Out.
(Beep)

05:58.564 --> 06:00.765
This isn't over.
Over.

06:02.501 --> 06:04.352
I'm gonna fire that kid.

06:04.386 --> 06:06.638
You can't fire somebody
because he follows his heart.

06:06.672 --> 06:07.972
- Come on now.
- What are you talking about?

06:08.006 --> 06:09.207
You had daughters.

06:09.241 --> 06:10.975
Did they ever have guys
over for the night?

06:11.009 --> 06:12.844
We were just talking, sir.
(Beep)

06:12.878 --> 06:15.547
Shut up, Kyle.
Over.

06:15.581 --> 06:17.198
No, no, no.
Absolutely not.

06:17.233 --> 06:20.368
- I set boundaries. I called them "the Ed commandments."
- "Ed commandments."

06:20.402 --> 06:21.719
And the number one commandment

06:21.754 --> 06:24.088
was no shenanigans
under my roof. That's it.

06:24.123 --> 06:25.323
I so get that.

06:25.357 --> 06:26.724
I mean, nobody wants to think
of their little angel

06:26.759 --> 06:30.211
playing human wheelbarrow
with some monster.

06:35.367 --> 06:36.634
God sakes, Ed!

06:36.669 --> 06:38.920
Okay.

06:38.971 --> 06:41.139
Look, the point is you gotta
lay down some ground rules

06:41.173 --> 06:44.676
so the inmates don't forget
who the warden is.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.177
You still mad at me?
(Beep)

06:46.212 --> 06:48.146
No, I'm not still mad at you.

06:48.180 --> 06:49.514
Where are you?
(Beep)

06:49.548 --> 06:51.816
Loading dock. Over.
(Beep)

06:51.851 --> 06:53.218
Sucker.

07:00.934 --> 07:03.087
Hi. Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man.

07:03.121 --> 07:04.888
Hey, guys, guard yourself.

07:04.923 --> 07:06.490
It's that time of the month.

07:06.524 --> 07:08.525
That's right.
It comes once a month.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.344
No big surprise to men.
But women?

07:10.395 --> 07:12.229
They're always surprised
once a month.

07:12.263 --> 07:14.264
How can they forget something
that happens once a month?

07:14.299 --> 07:17.167
We remind them, they get mad.
That's right,

07:17.202 --> 07:20.537
it's the Outdoor Man ammo sale.

07:20.572 --> 07:22.072
What did you think
I was talking about?

07:22.107 --> 07:24.074
(Laughs) You little devils.

07:24.109 --> 07:25.976
It's all about being out of
control with stuff, isn't it?

07:25.994 --> 07:28.145
The weather--we sell so much
stuff around here

07:28.179 --> 07:30.814
to control the weather--
G.P.S., weather stations,

07:30.849 --> 07:32.916
rain gear, tents that light up.

07:32.951 --> 07:34.151
What do you end up doing

07:34.169 --> 07:35.953
to protect yourself
against the weather?

07:35.987 --> 07:38.288
(Effeminate voice)
You dress in layers.

07:38.323 --> 07:40.357
(Normal voice) Just like
some primitive guy, huh?

07:40.392 --> 07:41.759
You can't control anything!

07:41.793 --> 07:43.494
Gophers-- we have gopher traps here.

07:43.528 --> 07:45.696
Ever try to trap a gopher?
You better like holes!

07:45.730 --> 07:48.866
They're just popping up,
going... (Laughs maniacally)

07:48.900 --> 07:50.968
You're in control of nothing!
Nothing!

07:51.002 --> 07:53.170
I tried to keep a big buck
out of my house

07:53.204 --> 07:55.139
'cause I got does
walking around, right?

07:55.173 --> 07:57.274
I go up there, the buck's
jumping out the window

07:57.308 --> 07:58.942
because he looks at a bear!

07:58.977 --> 08:00.511
Can I control it? No.

08:00.545 --> 08:03.380
You can't control diddly-squat!
Nothing!

08:03.415 --> 08:05.049
You think you can control something?

08:05.083 --> 08:08.619
You probably still think
grandpa's got your nose.

08:09.721 --> 08:11.522
I digress.

08:11.556 --> 08:13.991
That ammo sale is on.

08:14.025 --> 08:16.960
One month only. Period.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:27.038 --> 08:29.006
You're staring at it, aren't you?

08:29.040 --> 08:30.924
What?

08:30.959 --> 08:34.311
The pimple I got
from my stupid girl period.

08:34.345 --> 08:36.379
I-I don't see any pimple.

08:36.397 --> 08:38.182
You're a filthy <i>liar!</i>

08:38.216 --> 08:39.950
You know what? That's it.

08:39.984 --> 08:41.452
It's time for two
of mommy's special pills

08:41.486 --> 08:43.486
and a chocolate milk.

08:47.225 --> 08:48.525
All right, ladies.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.228
Family meeting.
He couch, okay?

08:51.246 --> 08:53.797
Oh, no. Why is he using
his creepy calm voice?

08:53.832 --> 08:58.452
Beats me. He's your father.
I just married him.

08:58.503 --> 08:59.953
Gonna have a family meeting
on the couch.

09:00.004 --> 09:01.738
(Kristin) Dad, what's going on?

09:01.773 --> 09:03.240
I know what you're all thinking--

09:03.258 --> 09:04.908
it's been a while since
we've had a family meeting.

09:04.926 --> 09:06.794
- Or ever.
- Or ever.

09:06.845 --> 09:09.412
But it's come to my attention

09:09.430 --> 09:10.430
that there's some things
that have gone a little loose,

09:10.465 --> 09:12.249
and I wanna establish some rules.

09:12.283 --> 09:13.884
- Rules--I--what? You didn't talk
to me about rules... - Bear with me.

09:13.918 --> 09:16.053
Just let me do this. You and I
will talk about it.

09:16.087 --> 09:17.554
- Just give me a minute.
Listen to what I have to say. - All right.

09:17.588 --> 09:20.891
Rule number one... (Sighs)
My computer is my computer.

09:20.925 --> 09:23.527
When I come home,
I don't wanna see shoes on there

09:23.561 --> 09:26.763
or gossip columns
or cats dressed like old people.

09:26.798 --> 09:31.368
(Giggling, imitating cat meowing)

09:31.402 --> 09:33.570
All right. Stop it.
Stop it.

09:33.605 --> 09:35.823
Ugh. Rule number two--

09:35.874 --> 09:39.126
I don't know what it is
about here in Brassiere-ville,

09:39.160 --> 09:41.328
but what is it about hanging
bras in the bathroom

09:41.379 --> 09:43.747
like Christmas ornaments?

09:43.781 --> 09:44.965
Is there some rule
against washing them

09:44.999 --> 09:46.133
where everybody else washes
their stuff?

09:46.167 --> 09:47.751
I don't hang my underwear
in the bathroom.

09:47.785 --> 09:49.887
That would be terrifying.

09:49.921 --> 09:52.089
And bras are not acceptable tops.

09:52.123 --> 09:54.525
A sports bra is still a bra.

09:54.559 --> 09:56.093
And because of your history grades,

09:56.127 --> 09:57.895
I'm gonna move your curfew
back to 10:00.

09:57.929 --> 09:59.296
- Whoa. Starting when?
- Starting now.

09:59.314 --> 10:00.931
No, no, no! But me and Travis
have tickets to "Plinq"!

10:00.965 --> 10:01.965
"Travis and <i>i."</i>

10:01.983 --> 10:04.634
You're going with Travis?

10:04.652 --> 10:06.803
Nobody's going with Travis.

10:06.855 --> 10:09.907
So I'm going to be "Plinq"-less?
But what about the <i>cloons?</i>

10:09.941 --> 10:11.808
Mike, what-- what are you doing?

10:11.826 --> 10:12.809
(Under breath) Listen,
when I finish what I'm doing,

10:12.827 --> 10:14.211
you'll know what I'm doing,

10:14.245 --> 10:16.146
then I'll explain
what I'm doing, all right?

10:16.164 --> 10:18.815
All right, the last rule's not
pointed at anyone in particular,

10:18.833 --> 10:22.319
but I don't want any...
Shenanigans in this house.

10:22.353 --> 10:24.221
Uh, what?

10:24.255 --> 10:25.789
What's shenanigans?

10:25.823 --> 10:26.874
Sex. Doing it.

10:26.925 --> 10:28.358
Hey.
Gross.

10:29.527 --> 10:30.627
This is all your fault, Kristin.

10:30.661 --> 10:31.995
You've ruined everything
for me and Eve.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.297
Whoa. Leave me out of it.

10:33.331 --> 10:34.431
I don't want to have shenanigans.

10:34.465 --> 10:35.432
Wouldn't worry about it, honey,

10:35.466 --> 10:36.833
with that giant zit on your face?

10:36.868 --> 10:38.852
- Mom! Mom!
- Mike...

10:38.887 --> 10:42.272
You know, I'm a grown woman.
You can't tell me what to do.

10:42.307 --> 10:43.674
- You live under my roof?
- Yes.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.225
- Do you pay rent already?
- No, dad, I don't pay rent!

10:45.276 --> 10:46.610
Then I have every right
to tell you what to do

10:46.644 --> 10:48.679
- in my house!
- You know, I'm getting a little tired

10:48.713 --> 10:50.514
of hearing about
the roof and the rent.

10:50.548 --> 10:52.182
And I'm getting a little tired
of images of you and Kyle

10:52.200 --> 10:54.017
in a wheelbarrow digging up turnips!

10:54.035 --> 10:55.519
Oh, my God!

10:55.553 --> 10:57.354
- Mike!
- Turnips?

10:57.372 --> 10:58.405
Dad, nothing happened.

10:58.456 --> 10:59.423
I don't believe you.

10:59.457 --> 11:01.692
You--that's it!
I'm moving out!

11:01.726 --> 11:02.993
You're not moving out.

11:03.027 --> 11:04.661
Ho-ho!
You don't believe me, do you?

11:04.695 --> 11:06.863
- No, I don't. - Mike, Mike, Mike,
tell her she's not moving out.

11:06.881 --> 11:08.966
- I just told her.
- Well, tell her better.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.250
(Door slams)

11:10.301 --> 11:12.502
And kaboom.

11:12.537 --> 11:14.304
(Exhales sharply) Wow.

11:14.339 --> 11:16.506
Wow.
What the heck is that?

11:25.283 --> 11:27.267
Thank you all.
Meeting adjourned.

11:33.554 --> 11:35.156
Mike!

11:35.190 --> 11:37.458
Hey, I know you're upset.

11:37.492 --> 11:39.160
I'm upset, too.

11:39.194 --> 11:40.961
I'm not upset!

11:40.996 --> 11:44.181
You're rotating your tires.
You do that when you're upset.

11:44.216 --> 11:48.536
I'm rotating my tires
to equalize tread wear.

11:48.570 --> 11:50.371
You're supposed to do it
every 6,000 miles.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.839
And when was the last time
you did it?

11:51.857 --> 11:53.858
About an hour ago.

11:53.892 --> 11:56.343
I would be playing catch
with my youngest daughter,

11:56.361 --> 11:58.079
but she won't play catch with me.

11:58.113 --> 11:59.647
All right, look,
it's not a good situation,

11:59.681 --> 12:01.515
but it could be worse.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.017
How could it be worse?

12:03.051 --> 12:05.986
We could have four daughters.

12:06.021 --> 12:09.189
Look Kyle is a nice, normal guy,

12:09.207 --> 12:11.058
and he seems
to really care about her.

12:11.093 --> 12:14.061
Right. Under that goofy exterior
lies the devil.

12:14.096 --> 12:15.713
Oh, come on.

12:15.747 --> 12:17.998
What kind of example does this
set for the other girls?

12:18.033 --> 12:19.717
I mean, they--they look
at Kristin's behavior,

12:19.751 --> 12:21.068
it'll set a precedent.

12:21.103 --> 12:22.553
And they're always
looking for loopholes.

12:22.587 --> 12:24.538
Now, Mike, stop. They're
teenagers. They're not lawyers.

12:24.556 --> 12:26.874
Mandy--she'll be using this.

12:26.892 --> 12:28.843
"Uh, per the landmark case of

12:28.877 --> 12:31.145
<i>"Kyle and Kristin vs.
The state of decency,</i>

12:31.179 --> 12:33.647
I'd like to have a roman orgy
up in my room."

12:33.682 --> 12:36.050
Mike, look, like it or not,

12:36.084 --> 12:38.652
Kristin is an adult
and a sexual being.

12:38.687 --> 12:41.388
Ah! Oof.
You don't know that.

12:41.423 --> 12:43.757
She has a child.

12:43.792 --> 12:48.863
Maybe she caught something
in a public swimming pool.

12:48.897 --> 12:50.414
If she wants to have sex
in this house,

12:50.448 --> 12:52.066
I'm not for it--end of story.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.168
You know that story
doesn't have a happy ending.

12:54.202 --> 12:57.204
Ugh. Do you have to use those words?

12:59.791 --> 13:01.709
(Knock on door)

13:01.743 --> 13:02.743
Come in.

13:05.046 --> 13:06.347
Oh, hi.

13:06.381 --> 13:09.016
I can't believe
you're really moving out.

13:09.050 --> 13:11.185
You've been in this house
my whole life.

13:11.219 --> 13:12.520
I've never lived here without you.

13:12.554 --> 13:15.589
Oh. I know. Oh, I know.
But look, it'll be okay.

13:15.624 --> 13:17.224
Okay? I'm still your big sister,

13:17.258 --> 13:19.226
- so you can't be sad.
- I <i>am</i> sad.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.695
I can't help it.
I-I hate when things change.

13:21.730 --> 13:24.465
Oh. Yeah. Me, too.

13:27.435 --> 13:31.238
Why are you holding paint swatches?

13:31.273 --> 13:32.740
Just because.

13:32.774 --> 13:34.208
I haven't even moved out yet.

13:34.242 --> 13:36.243
I know. And I'm dreading it.

13:36.277 --> 13:38.078
But--no rush--

13:38.113 --> 13:40.447
I would really love to start
priming in the morning.

13:40.465 --> 13:41.882
Unbelievable!

13:41.917 --> 13:43.250
Hey, come on.
You're leaving anyway.

13:43.284 --> 13:45.586
Why can't I miss you
from this larger room,

13:45.620 --> 13:47.488
in... Robin's egg blue?

13:47.522 --> 13:48.505
Get out!

13:50.675 --> 13:53.627
Oh, don't even think about
sticking a treadmill in there.

13:53.645 --> 13:56.096
Hi.

13:56.131 --> 13:58.032
Mom, you can't talk me out of this.

13:58.066 --> 13:59.733
I wasn't going to.

13:59.768 --> 14:02.269
But I would like to hear your plan.

14:02.303 --> 14:04.488
My plan is to not live
in a police state.

14:04.522 --> 14:08.342
Well, unlike, say, North Korea,

14:08.376 --> 14:10.644
we're having lasagna for dinner.

14:10.679 --> 14:12.997
I'm going to Kyle's.
Boyd loves Kyle's apartment.

14:13.031 --> 14:15.115
He thinks his roommates
are the Wiggles.

14:17.535 --> 14:19.286
Honey, you know,
your father loves you.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.921
You know that, right?

14:20.956 --> 14:22.823
Yeah, well, he has
a funny way of showing it.

14:22.857 --> 14:24.191
Yeah, well, tell me about it.

14:24.226 --> 14:27.194
For our tenth anniversary,
he threw me out of a plane.

14:27.229 --> 14:28.529
(Sighs)

14:28.563 --> 14:31.515
Listen, why--why don't you
just stay here tonight

14:31.549 --> 14:33.634
and see how you feel in the morning?

14:33.668 --> 14:36.003
Mom--mom, I can't.
Kyle's expecting us.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.978
Okay. All right. Well...

14:44.012 --> 14:46.447
Will you just call me in the morning?

14:46.481 --> 14:47.648
Of course.

14:51.219 --> 14:52.219
(Tape measure snaps)

14:53.922 --> 14:57.157
(Voice breaking)
I'm just so sad, because...

14:57.192 --> 14:59.243
She's been here my whole life, and...

14:59.294 --> 15:00.694
Stop, stop, stop.

15:00.729 --> 15:02.663
(Door closes)

15:08.103 --> 15:09.203
Hey.

15:09.237 --> 15:11.105
It's called knocking, Mike.

15:11.139 --> 15:14.008
I can lend you literature
on the subject.

15:14.042 --> 15:15.809
Those "Ed commandments" went over

15:15.844 --> 15:17.511
like a lead balloon at my house.

15:17.545 --> 15:19.480
All the girls started yelling at me.

15:19.514 --> 15:20.681
Kristin moved out.

15:20.715 --> 15:22.433
Well, I'm not surprised.

15:22.484 --> 15:25.286
Caused my family
nothing but heartache.

15:27.522 --> 15:30.257
For years, my daughters
wouldn't speak to me,

15:30.292 --> 15:31.959
I wouldn't speak to them.

15:31.993 --> 15:34.528
It was--it was just a big mess.

15:34.562 --> 15:36.397
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

15:36.431 --> 15:38.699
Well, I'm--I'm not
a great communicator.

15:38.733 --> 15:42.269
I thought I just made that clear.

15:42.304 --> 15:45.739
Kristin moved in with Kyle.
Where is that little rascal?

15:45.757 --> 15:47.074
I'm gonna have a little
conversation with him.

15:47.108 --> 15:48.408
Calm down. Come back.
Come--come on.

15:48.426 --> 15:50.611
Listen... Mike...

15:50.645 --> 15:52.379
When I was Kristin's age,

15:52.413 --> 15:56.016
there was this girl who lived
in the next town, right?

15:56.051 --> 16:01.555
Now I used to swim across
an icy lake to go see her,

16:01.589 --> 16:04.758
all right? Now this is
before modern wet suits.

16:04.776 --> 16:09.063
For insulation, I would
cover myself with bacon grease.

16:09.097 --> 16:12.099
And there were wolves
waiting for me on land.

16:12.117 --> 16:13.934
You've told me this story
a number of times.

16:13.968 --> 16:17.237
You added the wolf thing,
which is good. I like that.

16:17.271 --> 16:19.406
All right. What I'm saying
without saying,

16:19.440 --> 16:21.108
and you're forcing me to say now,

16:21.142 --> 16:23.077
is that maybe you've forgotten
what it's like

16:23.111 --> 16:27.581
to be young and in love.
Hmm?

16:27.615 --> 16:29.249
What are you, a greeting card?

16:33.121 --> 16:34.388
Oh, boy.

16:34.422 --> 16:36.173
I'm tired of hiding from you.

16:36.224 --> 16:38.258
You've been walking around here
like I've done something wrong.

16:38.293 --> 16:40.394
Haven't you?
You come into my house--

16:40.428 --> 16:41.729
you invited me into your house.

16:41.763 --> 16:44.998
You date my daughter--
you fixed us up.

16:45.033 --> 16:47.634
Kyle, your facts are
starting to piss me off.

16:47.669 --> 16:52.139
I would never disrespect you
or your daughter or your home.

16:52.173 --> 16:55.175
You should know that by now.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.027
Hey, how is she?

16:59.330 --> 17:01.031
She's good.

17:08.223 --> 17:11.492
(Kyle) And I'm in love with her.
Over.

17:19.517 --> 17:20.968
What are you doing here?

17:21.002 --> 17:23.170
Well, that's some greeting.
Does your manager know

17:23.188 --> 17:24.671
that's how you say "hello"
to customers?

17:24.689 --> 17:27.540
He has a general sense of it, yes.

17:27.575 --> 17:29.877
Well... Kristin,

17:29.911 --> 17:31.879
what I'd like is something
that's flavorless

17:31.913 --> 17:34.982
but yet makes me feel
a little bloated.

17:35.016 --> 17:38.285
Oh. Well, you're in luck,
'cause that's all we serve.

17:38.319 --> 17:42.406
I particularly don't
recommend the Sushi.

17:42.457 --> 17:43.824
A Sushi melt?

17:46.728 --> 17:49.029
Uh, how about just some apple pie?

17:49.063 --> 17:51.331
- Okay.
- Please.

17:51.366 --> 17:52.332
Okay.

17:52.366 --> 17:54.368
When I was first out of college,

17:54.402 --> 17:57.137
I had to live
with my parents for a while.

17:57.172 --> 18:00.073
My dad used to come
into my room every morning

18:00.108 --> 18:02.142
and ask me if I made my bed.

18:02.177 --> 18:05.078
23 years old-- did I make my bed?

18:05.113 --> 18:07.898
Okay. Is there a point?

18:07.932 --> 18:10.717
The point is, we're always
our parents' kids.

18:10.752 --> 18:12.553
Yeah, but, dad,
I'm not a kid anymore.

18:12.587 --> 18:14.655
Baby, you're my kid, you know?

18:14.689 --> 18:16.089
And you and I may disagree
on what's fair,

18:16.124 --> 18:17.658
but that's not gonna change.

18:17.692 --> 18:20.494
And I'm never gonna be okay with
having shenanigans in my house.

18:20.528 --> 18:21.628
(Bell dings)

18:24.232 --> 18:26.633
How are you and the Boyd
doing at Kyle's?

18:26.668 --> 18:29.036
Well...

18:29.070 --> 18:30.737
Boyd loves it,
because they have a trampoline

18:30.772 --> 18:32.739
where most people keep
a dining room table.

18:36.211 --> 18:38.245
I want you to come home.

18:38.279 --> 18:39.880
There, I said it.

18:39.914 --> 18:41.949
Nothing's changed.

18:41.983 --> 18:44.451
How about if I promise I'll try

18:44.486 --> 18:47.387
to treat you more like an adult
and respect you?

18:47.422 --> 18:50.457
What if I try harder to earn it?

18:50.492 --> 18:52.392
No more curfew.

18:52.427 --> 18:54.595
No shenanigans...

18:54.629 --> 18:55.996
In the house.

18:58.933 --> 19:00.601
All right. Deal.

19:00.635 --> 19:03.070
Thanks.

19:03.104 --> 19:05.138
Do you have any coffee
to go with this great pie?

19:05.173 --> 19:07.407
Yeah.

19:07.442 --> 19:09.009
(Mouth full) I kind of like it.

19:09.043 --> 19:10.244
Put raisins in there.

19:10.278 --> 19:11.879
We don't put raisins
in our apple pie.

19:11.913 --> 19:12.913
Oh.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.788
Honey, I'm telling you,
I can hardly even see it.

19:21.823 --> 19:23.891
Are you sure?
Please, don't touch it.

19:23.925 --> 19:25.292
I'm supposed to give an oral report

19:25.326 --> 19:26.627
first thing tomorrow morning.

19:26.661 --> 19:28.195
Oh.

19:30.198 --> 19:33.600
Well, trust me,
it--it's practically gone.

19:33.635 --> 19:35.736
Okay. If you're sure.

19:35.770 --> 19:37.905
Wow. When's that gonna go away?

19:39.841 --> 19:41.308
How you doing?

19:41.342 --> 19:43.644
I miss my childhood.
Thanks for asking.

19:46.147 --> 19:47.998
(Mouths words)

19:48.032 --> 19:48.999
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey, dad.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.367
- Hey, honey.
- Mr. B.

19:54.689 --> 19:57.424
(Stiffly) Well, I enjoyed our dinner.

19:57.458 --> 20:00.093
(Stiffly) Yes.
It was a wonderful date.

20:00.128 --> 20:01.395
Yes.

20:05.199 --> 20:08.502
He's a lovely young man.

20:10.572 --> 20:12.839
Why is your shirt inside out?

20:14.309 --> 20:15.842
Good night, dad.

20:17.729 --> 20:20.314
Just breathe.

20:20.348 --> 20:23.150
(Exhaling)

20:27.658 --> 20:28.681
I don't know.

20:28.801 --> 20:30.160
(Voice breaking) Can you just
explain it to me again?

20:30.280 --> 20:32.869
Because I'm just really angry

20:32.903 --> 20:35.004
and confused and upset right now,

20:35.039 --> 20:37.640
and I don't get it,
and I want to understand.

20:37.675 --> 20:39.475
- Okay. Listen to me, please.
- Yeah.

20:39.510 --> 20:42.178
Kristin... needs...

20:42.212 --> 20:47.483
Her... room... back.

20:48.886 --> 20:50.419
I'm still not following.

20:50.437 --> 20:51.921
Ugh.

20:51.939 --> 20:55.558
- I'm living in a house filled with
crazy people! - Ow. My God. Ow.

20:55.592 --> 20:57.527
- Hey, dad.
- What's up?

21:00.230 --> 21:02.498
Still feel like tossing
the ball around?

21:02.533 --> 21:04.484
Well, I would,

21:04.535 --> 21:08.271
but it's 11:30 and it's,
like, 28 degrees outside.

21:08.305 --> 21:11.207
Oh, well, just forget about it then!

21:12.909 --> 21:14.610
(Sighs)

21:14.645 --> 21:17.880
I'm gonna get out
and rotate the tires!
