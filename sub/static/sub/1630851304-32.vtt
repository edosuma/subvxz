IS NOT HAVE YOUR NA NAMES IN MY

MOUTH.

ME.

DEAL.

STRAIGHT TO JURY BUT SHE

01:35.195 --> 01:36.296
WOULDN'T BE ALONE.

01:36.362 --> 01:39.065
>> Julie: ONE OF YOU SITTING

AND WHICH TWO COOKOUT MEMBERS
WILL FIND THEMSELVESES WILL IN

02:58.044 --> 02:59.312
THE HOT SEAT?

02:59.379 --> 03:03.950
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

03:04.017 --> 03:06.653
>> WHY WOULD YOU NOT TAKE ME TO
VEGAS!

03:06.719 --> 03:15.428
I'M THE BEST TIME YOU CAN EVER
HAVE!

03:15.495 --> 03:22.201

♪ ♪ ♪
>> I'M FEELING GREAT!

03:28.007 --> 03:32.278
I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE BITCHES
WON'T GET ME OUT OF THIS HOUSE,

03:32.345 --> 03:33.813
BUT THEY KEEP KEEPING ME.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.782
IT FEELS GREAT TO BE IN TOP
FOUR.

03:35.848 --> 03:38.618
YOU KNOW, THE BOYS DID STICK TO
THEIR WORD AND MADE SURE I

03:38.685 --> 03:39.452
STAYED HERE.

03:39.519 --> 03:41.688
BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT LETLE VETO
STUNT.

03:41.754 --> 03:44.057
BOTH OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF
EXPLAINING TO DO, BECAUSE THEY

03:44.123 --> 03:49.762
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LOYAL TO ME
AND NOT EACH OTHER.

03:49.829 --> 03:50.430
>> BREATHE, BREATHE.

03:50.496 --> 03:51.297
>> THANK YOU.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.333

YOU KNOW.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.202
I JUST SENT MY BABY SIS OUT THE
DOOR.

03:56.269 --> 03:59.038
BUT I FEEL VERY GOOD TO BE HERE
STILL.

03:59.105 --> 04:01.374
IT MEANS I'M DOING SOMETHING
RIGHT.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.210
THE FACT THAT I'VE BEEN ON THE
BLOCK FIVE TIMES AND ONLY SEEN

04:04.277 --> 04:08.481
THE VOTE ONCE I THINK SPEAKS
VOLUMES HOW I'M PLAYING THIS

04:08.548 --> 04:08.881
GAME.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.617
>> FINAL FOUR.

04:10.683 --> 04:11.184
CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYBODY.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.619
THAT WAS FAST.

04:12.685 --> 04:15.888
DOUBLE EVICTIONS ARE NOTORIOUS
FOR BLINDSIDING PEOPLE,

04:15.955 --> 04:17.523
ESPECIALLY BIG COMPETITORS.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.925
IT EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN ME.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.627
AND I'M NOW IN FINAL FOUR.

04:20.693 --> 04:24.831
I'M SO CLOSE TO THE END I CAN'T
STOP UNTIL I'M IN THOSE FINAL

04:24.897 --> 04:25.365
TWO CHAIRS.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.599
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:26.666 --> 04:32.138
I'M IN FINAL FOUR, WINNING MY
FIRST H.O.H. WAS AMAILSING, BUT

04:32.205 --> 04:34.440
THE DOUBLE EVICTION WAS FREAKING
INTENSE.

04:34.507 --> 04:35.274
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
AZAH!

04:35.341 --> 04:38.177
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

04:38.244 --> 04:41.648
>> HANNAH AND I HAVE HAD SIMILAR
INTERESTS WORKING TOGETHER IN

04:41.714 --> 04:45.118
THE PAST, BUT WE'VE NEVER
SOLIDIFIED ANY DEAL.

04:45.184 --> 04:49.188
BIG "D" IS MY BEST FRIEND IN THE
HOUSE, AND XAVIER HAS HAD MY

04:49.255 --> 04:50.490
BACK IN THE PAST.

04:50.556 --> 04:54.293
AT THIS POINT, MY BEST SHOT AT
MAKING IT TO FINAL THREE IS

04:54.360 --> 04:55.695
STAYING LOYAL TO THEM.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.897
>> OKAY, OKAY, CONGRATULATIONS.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.065
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

04:59.132 --> 05:03.069
I'M PUTTING X. AND YOU UP.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.006
I WANT X. TO BE.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.942
HOPEFULLY YOU WIN THE VETO AND I
CAN PUT KYLAND UP.

05:10.009 --> 05:12.979
I NEED TO GET A BIG TARGET OUT.

05:13.046 --> 05:20.753
YOU CAN'T PUT KY AND ME UP.

05:20.820 --> 05:25.625
IF X. WINS THE VETO, KY GOES UP
AND KY GOES HOME.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.327
IF KY WINS THE VETO, THE NOMS
STAY THE SAME.

05:28.394 --> 05:32.298
>> RIGHT NOW, HANNAH IS ASKING
RAMMED-FIRE QUESTIONS, AND I

05:32.365 --> 05:35.334
DON'T WANT HANNAH TO FEEL
FRAZZLES.

05:35.401 --> 05:39.872
FRAZZLES.

05:39.939 --> 05:44.077
>> YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE TO WEEP
X.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.612
I WILL BREAK THE TIE IN YOUR
FAVOR.

05:46.679 --> 05:46.913
OKAY.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.014
.I LIED.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.818
I LIED TO THE YOUNGEST,
SWEETEST, CUTE LITTLE THING IN

05:51.884 --> 05:53.519
THE HOUSE.

05:53.586 --> 05:54.487
I DID.

05:54.554 --> 05:57.824
I'M GOING TO ASK GOD'S
FORGIVENESS AND MOVE ON.

05:57.890 --> 06:03.529
WE HAVE A VETO, WE HAVE AN
EVICTION, AND WE HAVE NEXT WEEK.

06:03.596 --> 06:06.599
UNFORTUNATELY, X. AND HANNAH,
I'M GOING TO BE NOMINATING YOU

06:06.666 --> 06:07.867
TODAY.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.203
NOW THAT HANNAH IS ON THE BLOCK,
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE HANNAH DOES

06:10.269 --> 06:11.037
NOT WIN VETO.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.672
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
KYLAND.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.041
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.242
.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.380
>> I TRIED PROPOSING A DEAL LAST
WEEK.

06:21.447 --> 06:24.183
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO BRING
STRONG COMPETITORS TO THE END.

06:24.250 --> 06:30.456
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WANT A FINAL
FOUR WITH X., AZAH, AND BIG D.,

06:30.523 --> 06:35.394
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE A PARENT
OF THAT.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.730
>> THAT IS WHAT I'M GOING TO
DO--

06:37.797 --> 06:39.732
>> YOU'RE GOING TO PULL X. OFF?

06:39.799 --> 06:40.500
>> YES.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.468
>> YOU CAN PLEASE VOTE TO KEEP
ME?

06:42.535 --> 06:43.736
>> I BELIEVE THAT I CAN.

06:43.803 --> 06:47.073
I THINK THAT THAT IS-- I HAVE TO
CHECK WITH X. AND PEOPLE.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.475
I'M GOING TO USE THE VETO ON
XAVIER.

06:49.542 --> 06:52.645
I ONLY WANT TO BE HONEST WITH
HER, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN

06:52.712 --> 06:53.780
SAVE HER.

06:53.846 --> 06:56.449
>> BIG "D" IS HERE FOR THE FAME.

06:56.516 --> 06:57.717
HE'S HERE FOR THE MONEY.

06:57.784 --> 07:02.755
I DON'T WANT TO THROW HIM UNDER
THE BUS, BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE

07:02.822 --> 07:04.223
PART OF THE FINAL FOUR.

07:04.290 --> 07:08.828
>> IF YOU CAN CONVINCE X. TO
SWITCH HIS VOTE.

07:08.895 --> 07:12.365
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A
DECIDING FACTOR IN TERMS OF

07:12.431 --> 07:13.499
H.O.H.

07:13.566 --> 07:16.102
I'M SORRY, LET ME TALK--
>> ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE TO KEEP

07:16.169 --> 07:19.305
ME OR ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE TO
KEEP BIG "D"?

07:19.372 --> 07:20.873
>> I'M GOING TO KEEP.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.808
YOU I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.509
>> THANK YOU.

07:23.576 --> 07:28.214
>> GEN WEDGE, I WOULD LIKE TO
VOTE TO KEEP HANNAH, BUT IF THE

07:28.281 --> 07:33.186
VOTE IS SPLIT BETWEEN KYLAND AND
I IT PUTS AZAH IN A BAD DECISION

07:33.252 --> 07:34.854
WHERE SHE HAS TO BREAK THE DIE
AND SEND EITHER BIG "D" OR

07:34.921 --> 07:35.855
HANNAH HOME.

07:35.922 --> 07:42.128
THE BACKLASH TO ME COULD BE
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.598
>> BEING THE H.O.H., I HAD TO
MAKE DIFFERENT DEALS AND

07:45.665 --> 07:49.068
PROMISES AND RIGHT NOW I DO HAVE
ONE TO TAKE XAVIER OFF, SO I'M

07:49.135 --> 07:50.837
GOING TO USE IT ON YOU.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.674
>> Julie: XAVIER, YOU CAN SIT
ON ONE OF THE COUCHES AND, YEAH,

07:54.740 --> 07:56.542
THERE'S ONLY ONE OPTION.

07:56.609 --> 07:57.276
THAT'S YOU, BIG "D."

07:57.343 --> 07:59.645
>> I'M OKAY WITH THAT, BABY!

07:59.712 --> 08:00.847
>> Julie: OKAY.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.683
>> WHEN THE VETO GETS USED, I AM
LIVID BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT A

08:03.749 --> 08:05.618
PART OF MY PLAN.

08:05.685 --> 08:09.622
FOR XAVIER AND KYLAND TO KIND OF
PULL A FAST ONE ON ME, IT REALLY

08:09.689 --> 08:11.791
MAKES ME UPSET.

08:11.858 --> 08:16.996
BUT I HAVE TO TRUST WHAT THESE
BOYS ARE GOING TO DO WHAT NEEDS

08:17.063 --> 08:18.130
TO GET DONE.

08:18.197 --> 08:21.200
BUT NEXT TIME, GIVE ME A
HEADS-UP, BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING

08:21.267 --> 08:24.770
WITH MY GAME, AND I DON'T BLA
WITH Y'ALL'S GAME.

08:24.837 --> 08:28.908
>> Julie: I'LL BE BACK FOR THE
SECOND VOTE AND EVICTION IN JUST

08:28.975 --> 08:36.949
A FEW MINUTES.

08:37.016 --> 08:40.419
>> DID YOU TELL AZAH YOU WERE
VOTING TO KEEP HER.

08:40.486 --> 08:41.954
>> I WOULD LIKE TO.

08:42.021 --> 08:45.057
>> I TOLD HER I WAS VOTING TO
KEEP HER.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.593
DID YOU TELL HER THAT?

08:47.660 --> 08:52.098
>> NO, I SAID I WANT TO VOTE TO
KEEP HER.

08:52.164 --> 08:56.135
>> WE CAN'T DECIDE WHICH ONE OF
US IS GOING TO BE THAT SYMPATHY

08:56.202 --> 09:00.239
VOTE FOR HANNAH.

09:00.306 --> 09:03.109
I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE HANNAH A
SYMPATHY VOTE.

09:03.175 --> 09:06.712
SHE IS SOMEONE I TRULY VIEW AS
MY YOUNGER SISTER, BUT I NEED

09:06.779 --> 09:10.116
KYLAND TO FEEL A GREATER SENSE
OF LOYALTY BETWEEN HIM AND I, SO

09:10.182 --> 09:12.385
HE BRINGS ME TO FINAL TWO.

09:12.451 --> 09:16.555
FOR MY PERSONAL GAME MOVING
FORWARD, I CAN'T VOTE FOR

09:16.622 --> 09:17.590
CHADDHA.

09:17.657 --> 09:18.624
>> THOSE TWO ARE GOING TO GO TO
THE END TOGETHER.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.092
THEY HAVE A FINAL TWO.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.128
>> I'M READY.

09:22.194 --> 09:27.333
I ALREADY KNEW.

09:29.769 --> 09:30.136
7.

09:30.202 --> 09:31.804
>> I DON'T KNOW.

09:31.871 --> 09:34.607
KY AND X. HAVE THE VOTES.

09:34.674 --> 09:35.541
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO.

09:35.608 --> 09:36.742
IT'S OKAY.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.278
AZAH DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT I
MADE A FINAL THREE WITH THE

09:39.345 --> 09:40.513
GUYS.

09:40.579 --> 09:43.616
SO I'M JUST GOING TO STAY COOL
AND HOPEFULLY THE DE DEALS THAT

09:43.683 --> 09:49.956
MADE WITH XAVIER AND KYLAND WILL
GET MEADE THROUGH THIS NEXT

09:50.022 --> 09:50.723
ELIMINATION.

09:50.790 --> 09:51.991
WE CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH ABOUT
IT.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.626
I TRIED.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.562
>> MY STOMACH DOES NOT SIT RIGHT
WITH THIS MOVE.

09:56.629 --> 10:00.499
I WOULD NEVER THINK THAT KYLAND
WOULD USE A VETO TO PUT BIG "D"

10:00.566 --> 10:02.168
UP IN SOMEBODY'S PLACE.

10:02.234 --> 10:06.105
I'M WONDERING IF BIG "D" IS
THEIR TARGET TO GO OUT, AND

10:06.172 --> 10:07.340
THEY'RE TAKING OVER MY H.O.H.

10:07.406 --> 10:10.543
>> YOU SAID YOU WANT PEOPLE HERE
WHO LOVE THE GAME, WHO RESPECT

10:10.609 --> 10:12.945
THE GAME, WHO AREN'T HERE FOR
THE PRIZE MONEY.

10:13.012 --> 10:13.512
>> YEAH.

10:13.579 --> 10:14.947
>> I AM HERE TO COMPETE.

10:15.014 --> 10:16.115
I AM HERE TO PLAY.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.718
YOU SAID YOU WANT TO GO TO THE
END WITH STRONG COMPETITORS.

10:18.784 --> 10:22.221
NOW, I'M NOT SURE IF YOU DON'T
SEE ME AS A STRONG COMPETITOR,

10:22.288 --> 10:24.256
BUT I MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO YOU
WHERE I STAND WITH YOU.

10:24.323 --> 10:27.760
>> WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN WHAT
AZAH WANTS IN THE SITUATION.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.463
>> SHE CAN'T COMPETE IN THE NEXT
H.O.H. COMP.

10:30.529 --> 10:33.566
YOU GUYS HAVE TO PLAY FOR YOUR
OWN PERSONAL GAMES.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.002
PLEASE VOTE TO KEEP ME, PLEASE,
PLEASE.

10:36.068 --> 10:37.036
>> WE UNDERSTAND, CHADDHA.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.104
WE HAVE TO THINK THIS OVER.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.338
>> PLEASE.

10:39.405 --> 10:44.276
>> Julie: BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE
OF 2-0, HANNAH, YOU ARE EVICTED

10:44.343 --> 10:45.411
FROM THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

10:45.478 --> 10:49.949
>> I ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO NOT
SPLIT THE VOTE, BECAUSE I

10:50.016 --> 10:51.617
REALIZE CHADDHA IS GOING HOME
EITHER WAY.

10:51.684 --> 10:52.885
>> I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.855
I HAVE, FOR THE MOST PART,
HONORED PEOPLE'S H.O.H.s.

10:55.921 --> 11:00.359
IF KYLAND WANTED TO USE THE VETO
ON XAVIER, THAT IS SOMETHING HE

11:00.426 --> 11:02.028
COULD HAVE TOLD ME, BUT HE
DIDN'T.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.462
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PLAYED.

11:03.529 --> 11:06.599
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE FELT
PLAYED ANY TIME IN THIS GAME,

11:06.665 --> 11:08.434
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PLAYED
NOW.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.735
>> KEEP YOUR HEAD UP.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.470
>> WE LOVE YOU, HANNAH.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.372
>> NO HARD FEELINGS AT ALL.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.707
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

11:14.774 --> 11:15.875
>> LOVE YOU, HANNAH.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.543
>> LOVE YOU, HANNAH.

11:17.610 --> 11:23.449
>> ACHIEVING PHENYL FOUR IS A
HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.851
I AM ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE
FINAL TWO CHAIRS.

11:25.918 --> 11:29.155
DEFINITELY HAVE TO DO DAMAGE
CONTROL BUT EVERY COMPETITION

11:29.221 --> 11:30.022
GOING FORWARD MATTERS.

11:30.089 --> 11:32.224
EVERY STEP I TAKE HAS TO BE
CALCULATED.

11:32.291 --> 11:32.958
IT HAS TO BE PERFECT.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.026
IT'S PUT UP OR SHUT UP.

11:41.801 --> 11:46.338
>> SURE.

11:46.405 --> 11:50.076
>> I WAS AFRAID OF KEEPING DEREK
OFF AND LETTING HIM VOTE.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.077
I WAS WORRIED.

11:51.143 --> 11:54.013
>> THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO
LEAVE YOU, EITHER.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.114
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.783
>> IF WE'RE GOING TO DO IT,
WE'RE BOTH GOING TO DO IT.

11:57.850 --> 12:01.520
>> I HOPE YOU DON'T FEEL ME
TAKING OFF PUTS THE LIGHT.

12:01.587 --> 12:06.692
>> WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.861
>> WE'RE SITTING, RIGHT?

12:08.928 --> 12:10.096
>> YEAH.

12:10.162 --> 12:13.666
>> I DO HAVE A FINAL TWO WITH
XAVIER, AND THAT IS THE ONE I'M

12:13.732 --> 12:17.203
MOST COMMITTED TO, BUT I CAN'T
LET DEREK KNOW THAT.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.939
WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER H.O.H. AND
A VETO THAT SEPARATES ME FROM

12:20.005 --> 12:20.739
THE FINAL THREE.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.875
AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE I GET
THERE.

12:22.942 --> 12:23.576
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.277
>> NO, WE'RE GOOD.

12:25.344 --> 12:29.615
>> I VOTED OUT HANNAH TO MAKE
KYLAND FEEL LIKE I'M LOYAL TO

12:29.682 --> 12:31.450
HIM CURING THE DOUBLE EVICTION.

12:31.517 --> 12:34.720
BUT MY LOYALTY IS PRIMARILY TO
BIG "D."

12:34.787 --> 12:37.256
THE FIRST FINAL TWO I MADE WAS
WITH BIG "D."

12:37.323 --> 12:40.459
>> YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON I
TRUST, LIKE, COMPLETELY, SO I'M

12:40.526 --> 12:43.829
GOING TO DO WHATEVER YOU TELL ME
TO DO AND I'M GOING TO FOLLOW

12:43.896 --> 12:44.463
YOUR LEAD.

12:44.530 --> 12:45.831
ME AND YOU HAVE A FINAL TWO.

12:45.898 --> 12:49.335
>> ULTIMATELY, I WANT TO BRING
BIG "D" TO THE FINAL TWO, BUT I

12:49.401 --> 12:52.538
NEED TO DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO,
TO ENSURE THAT I'M BEING BROUGHT

12:52.605 --> 12:53.873
TO FINAL TWO.

12:53.939 --> 13:01.647
>> THANK YOU.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.549
>> I'M SORRY, BIG "D."

13:03.616 --> 13:05.518
>> IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.153
.NO, NO LISTEN.

13:07.219 --> 13:13.058
WHAT DID I SAY IN LISTEN.

13:13.125 --> 13:13.692
LISTEN.

13:13.759 --> 13:14.560
LISTEN.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.561
>> HONESTLY, THEY DIDN'T NEED TO
DO THAT.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.929
RIGHT NOW, I'M PISSED.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.198
THIS IS MY FIRST H.O.H. OF THE
SEASON.

13:19.265 --> 13:22.735
I SHOULD BE FEELING PRETTY
OVERJOYED, BUT I DON'T BECAUSE I

13:22.801 --> 13:30.376
WAS FORCED TO PUT UP MY ALLY,
AND IT LEAVES ME FEEL VERY ICKY

13:30.442 --> 13:31.177
AND UPSET.

13:31.243 --> 13:32.578
WHY WOULD THEY PUT YOU THROUGH
THAT?

13:32.645 --> 13:33.078
>> IT'S OKAY.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.113
WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.214
WE HAVE A GAME COMING.

13:35.281 --> 13:41.887
WE HAVE TO FOCUS, AND LET'S GO.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.956
ALL RIGHT.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.058
FIRST, LET ME SAY--
>> GO AHEAD.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.726
>> MY ATTITUDE IS NOT WITH YOU.

13:47.793 --> 13:48.928
>> YOU'RE GOOD.

13:48.994 --> 13:53.866
>> IT'S JUST NO ONE TELLS-- NO
ONE TOLD ME WHAT WAS GOING ON.

13:53.933 --> 13:57.369
WITH KYLAND AND XAVIER PULLING
THE STUNT THEY DID, I DON'T KNOW

13:57.436 --> 13:59.138
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR MY FUTURE IN
THIS GAME.

13:59.205 --> 14:02.908
I DON'T CARE WHO IS SITTING NEXT
TO ME, BUT I DESERVE A SEAT AT

14:02.975 --> 14:03.943
THOSE FINAL TWO CHAIRS.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.411
>> GO AHEAD.

14:05.477 --> 14:10.049
>> I AUTOMATICALLY THOUGHT,
DAMN, DID AZAH MAKE A FINAL TWO

14:10.115 --> 14:13.519
WITH KY WITHOUT TELLING ME,
THROWING ME TO THE CURB AFTER

14:13.586 --> 14:14.453
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.756
>> I UNDERSTAND WHY IT FELT LIKE
A BLINDSIDE.

14:17.823 --> 14:22.528
IT'S NO SURPRISE BIG "D" IS
UPSET KYLAND USED THE VETO ON

14:22.595 --> 14:24.096
ME, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE A
FINAL THREE.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.466
ONE OF THE THINGS I'M TRYING TO
DO IS NOT HAVE EITHER OF YOUR

14:27.533 --> 14:28.100
NAMES IN MY MOUTH.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.301
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.638
>> WHEN KYLAND USED THE GOLDEN
POWER OF VETO ON ME, OBVIOUSLY

14:32.705 --> 14:37.443
IT WAS GOING TO RAISE A BIG FLAG
WITH BIG "D," BECAUSE NOW IT

14:37.509 --> 14:41.013
LOOKS LIKE KYLAND IS PICKING ME
OVER BIG "D," AND I CAN

14:41.080 --> 14:45.784
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT MIGHT MAKE
BIG "D" UPSET.

14:45.851 --> 14:46.685
>>
WE'RE GOOD.

14:46.752 --> 14:49.054
>> I DON'T LEAVE YOU GUYS OUT ON
PANS.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.689
>> NO, I KNOW.

14:50.756 --> 14:52.725
♪ ♪ ♪
>> HEY, EVERYBODY!

14:52.791 --> 14:56.495
I NEED YOU ALL TO GATHER IN THE
LIVING ROOM.

14:56.562 --> 15:05.404
>> WOOOO!

15:05.471 --> 15:10.376
>> I'M STAR OF THE NEW CBS
SERIES "C.S.I.: VEGAS."

15:10.442 --> 15:13.545
YOU DO THIS JOB LONG ENOUGH AND
YOU FIGURE OUT THERE ARE A WHOLE

15:13.612 --> 15:17.316
LOT OF CAREFUL CRIMINALS OUT
THERE.

15:17.383 --> 15:18.684
>> C.S.I.'S HAVE THE SCENE.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.386
>> THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.888
I JUST HAD TO KNOW WHERE TO
LOOK.

15:22.955 --> 15:26.859
>> YOU AND I BOTH KNOW WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE WHEN A SCENE IS

15:26.925 --> 15:27.626
STAGED.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.295
>> NOW, WE JUST HAVE TO PROVE
IT.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.597
>> FINALLY, A TESTABLE
HYPOTHESIS.

15:31.664 --> 15:38.671
>> IF WE DON'T GET TO THE TRUTH,
NOBODY WILL.

15:38.737 --> 15:39.104
>> WOOO!

15:39.171 --> 15:39.672
>> OKAY.

15:39.738 --> 15:40.639
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

15:40.706 --> 15:43.275
>> LOVE ME SOME "C.S.I.."

15:43.342 --> 15:46.679
>> MY CHARACTER IS ALWAYS
DIGGING DEEPER TO GET TO THE

15:46.745 --> 15:47.846
TRUTH.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.949
SO IN TODAY'S CRIME SCENE
COMPETITION, YOU'LL DO THE SAME

15:51.016 --> 15:52.384
TO BECOME THE NEXT HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

15:52.451 --> 15:56.155
NOT ONLY WILL YOU REAP THE
BENEFITS OF BEING H.O.H., BUT

15:56.221 --> 16:01.060
YOU'LL ALSO BE TREATED TO A
SNEAK PEEK OF OUR FIRST EPISODE.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.129
GET READY AND "BIG BROTHER" WILL
CALL YOU ONE AT A TIME TO

16:04.196 --> 16:04.797
COMPETE.

16:04.863 --> 16:05.331
>> YEAH!

16:05.397 --> 16:06.699
>> GOOD LUCK!

16:06.765 --> 16:07.800
>> OKAY.

16:07.866 --> 16:08.167
<i>( APPLAUSE ).</i>

16:08.233 --> 16:09.435
>> OKAY.

16:09.501 --> 16:10.703
>> YAY!

16:10.769 --> 16:11.837
>> "C.S.I.: VEGAS."

16:11.904 --> 16:14.139
>> THE FINAL H.O.H. IS BIG.

16:14.206 --> 16:16.975
NOT ONLY DOES IT GUARANTEE YOUR
PLACE IN THE FINAL THREE, IT IS

16:17.042 --> 16:20.479
THE ONLY H.O.H. OF THE SUMMER
THAT YOU CAN COMPETE IN

16:20.546 --> 16:21.714
BACK-TO-BACK H.O.H.s.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.450
I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING IN
MY POWER TO MAKE SURE I WIN THIS

16:24.516 --> 16:28.620
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, AND I'VE COME
TOO FAR TO LET IT SLIP OUT OF MY

16:28.687 --> 16:29.888
HANDS NOW.

16:29.955 --> 16:34.827
>> BEING THIS CLOSE TO BEING TO
THE END OF THIS GAME LEADS ME TO

16:34.893 --> 16:37.429
THINK OF ALL THE THINGS I
SACRIFICED TO GET HERE AND I

16:37.496 --> 16:40.366
DIDN'T COME THIS FAR JUST TO
COME THIS FAR.

16:40.432 --> 16:43.035
I AM HERE TO MAKE IT TO THOSE
FINAL TWO CHAIRS.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.436
IT'S TIME TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.573
>> SINCE I WON H.O.H. IN THE
DOUBLE EVICTION, I CAN'T PLAY IN

16:47.639 --> 16:48.841
THIS H.O.H.

16:48.907 --> 16:54.680
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY STANDING IS
IN THIS HOUSE, BUT I DEFINITELY

16:54.747 --> 16:57.349
FEEL THE NEW H.O.H. HAS PUT A
TARGET ON MY BACK.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.618
>> NOW IT'S EVERY MAN AND WOMAN
FOR THEMSELVES.

16:59.685 --> 17:03.822
THE GUYS PULLED A LITTLE FAST
ONE ON ME BY PUT MEG OPT BLOCK

17:03.889 --> 17:06.024
WITHOUT ME KNOWING AND THAT
SCARES ME.

17:06.091 --> 17:07.793
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAD A HANDLE
ON THIS GAME.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.462
I HAVE TO WIN THIS H.O.H.

17:10.529 --> 17:14.733
COMPETITION TO MAKE SURE THAT
THERE ARE NO MORE BLINDSIDES ON

17:14.800 --> 17:16.902
DEREK F. GOING FORWARD.

17:16.969 --> 17:17.703
OH, MY GOD!

17:17.770 --> 17:19.171
THIS IS SO NERVE-RACKING!

17:33.852 --> 17:37.890
WHEN I GET INTO THE B.B. CRIME
LAB, IT IS EPIC.

17:37.956 --> 17:38.757
ALL RIGHT.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.292
THERE'S A BUNCH OF EVIDENCE ON
THE WALL.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.695
THERE'S A BIG GIANT COMPUTER,
AND I'M EXCITED BECAUSE I FEEL

17:43.762 --> 17:47.332
LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING I CAN
ACTUALLY WIN.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.135
"WELCOME TO THE B.B. CRIME LAB.

17:50.202 --> 17:54.139
THE H.O.H. KEY HAS BEEN STOLEN
FROM THE B.B. 23 MUSEUM, AND

17:54.206 --> 17:57.576
IT'S YOUR JOB TO FIND THE CLUES,
COLLECT THE CORRECT EVIDENCE,

17:57.643 --> 18:00.078
AND IDENTIFY THE PRIMARY
SUSPECT.

18:00.145 --> 18:03.849
HERE'S HOW IT GOES: GRAB YOUR
BLACK LIGHT AND BEGIN TO LOOK

18:03.916 --> 18:05.951
FOR THE CLUES IN THE CRIME
SCENE.

18:06.018 --> 18:10.722
LOOK HIGH AND LOOK LOW FOR FIVE
PIECES OF THE GLOWING EVIDENCE.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.725
ONCE YOU FIND A CLUE, REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAW AND HEAD BACK TO

18:13.792 --> 18:17.262
THE LAB TO TRY TO MATCH THE CLUE
WITH THE EVIDENCE ON THE WALL.

18:17.329 --> 18:21.200
ONCE YOU THINK YOU HAVE FOUND
THE MATCH, PLACE IT ON YOUR

18:21.266 --> 18:24.937
COMPUTER, CONTINUE TO DO THIS
UNTIL YOU FIND AND IDENTIFY ALL

18:25.003 --> 18:26.171
FIVE PIECES OF EVIDENCE.

18:26.238 --> 18:29.341
ONCE YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE THE
FIVE CORRECT PIECES OF EVIDENCE

18:29.408 --> 18:31.243
IN THE COMPUTER SCANNER, HIT
YOUR BUTTON.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.646
IF YOU HAVE COLLECTEDLY THE
CORRECT FIVE PIECES OF EVIDENCE,

18:34.713 --> 18:37.683
THE COMPUTER WILL IDENTIFY THE
SUSPECT, AND YOU WILL LOCK IN

18:37.749 --> 18:38.951
YOUR TIME.

18:39.017 --> 18:41.320
IF YOU HAVE NOT COLLECTEDLY THE
CORRECT PIECES OF EVIDENCE, THE

18:41.386 --> 18:45.357
COMPUTER WILL INDICATE IT CANNOT
FIND A MATCH, AND YOU MUST

18:45.424 --> 18:47.326
FIGURE OUT WHERE THE
INVESTIGATION WENT WRONG.

18:47.392 --> 18:51.530
THE NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD WILL
BE THE PLAYER WHO IDENTIFIES AND

18:51.597 --> 18:54.233
MATCHES THE FIVE PIECES OF
EVIDENCE THE FASTEST.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.769
ARE YOU READY TO PLAY B.B. CRIME
LAB?"

18:57.836 --> 19:00.072
YES, I AM!

19:00.138 --> 19:08.046
( HORN BLOWS )
MY STRATEGY IN THIS COMPETITION

19:08.113 --> 19:12.584
IS TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT EACH
AND EVERY SINGLE DETAIL.

19:12.651 --> 19:13.418
WHAT THE...

19:13.485 --> 19:15.487
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

19:15.554 --> 19:17.356
GOT IT.

19:17.422 --> 19:18.156
OKAY.

19:18.223 --> 19:19.658
CIRCLE, CIRCLE.

19:19.725 --> 19:22.828
BUT IN THE MOMENT WHEN YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR THINGS AND THEN YOU

19:22.895 --> 19:26.932
GO BACK TO THE WALL, THERE'S SO
MANY DECOYS THAT LOOK THE SAME,

19:26.999 --> 19:31.403
IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IS WHAT.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.005
CIRCLE, CIRCLE, DASH, DASH.

19:33.071 --> 19:37.709
YOU START SECOND GUESSING
YOURSELF.

19:37.776 --> 19:43.148
THE FINGER PREVENT CLUE IS VERY
DIFFICULT FOR ME.

19:43.215 --> 19:44.349
BIG CIRCLE.

19:44.416 --> 19:49.221
I'M SITTING HERE GOING, CIRCLE,
CIRCLE, DASH, DASH, CIRCLE,

19:49.288 --> 19:52.991
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE
DETAIL OF THE FINGER PREVENT IS.

19:53.058 --> 19:57.296
I COUNT FIVE CIRCLES IN THE
FINGERPRINT, AND I DEFINITELY AM

19:57.362 --> 20:01.466
GOING TO GO WITH FINGERPRINT
NUMBER 10.

20:01.533 --> 20:11.510
( BUZZER )
ONE, TWO, 4.

20:11.577 --> 20:18.150
( BUZZER )
ONE, TWO, 4.

20:18.216 --> 20:23.221
ONCE AGAIN, HERE'S ANOTHER CLUE
THAT HAS ABOUT FIVE DE DECOYS TH

20:23.288 --> 20:24.423
LOOK THE SAME.

20:24.489 --> 20:27.593
THE WAM I'M ABLE TO TELL THE
DIFFERENCE IN THE SHOE PRINTS IS

20:27.659 --> 20:30.862
THERE ARE 10 RIDGES AT THE TOP
AND THERE ARE FOUR RIDGES AT THE

20:30.929 --> 20:31.797
BOTTOM.

20:31.863 --> 20:35.334

31:56.781 --> 31:59.450
WIN WHEN YOU NEED TO.

31:59.517 --> 32:06.257
YOU NEEDED TO BEAT KYLAND AND
YOU DID.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.693
>> CONGRATULATIONS, X., ONCE
AGAIN.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.794
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

32:09.861 --> 32:10.695
>> CONGRATS, X.

32:10.762 --> 32:18.002
>> THANKS, AZAH.

32:18.069 --> 32:21.806
>> I'M A DUMMY!

32:21.873 --> 32:26.644
>> I'M PRETTY DISAPPOINTED THAT
I LOST THIS H.O.H. COMPETITION.

32:26.711 --> 32:32.183
I DEFINITELY COULD HAVE, SHOULD
HAVE, AND PROBABLY REALLY NEEDED

32:32.250 --> 32:36.721
TO DO BETTER AT THAN I DID.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.123
HOW WAS I SO STUPID?

32:39.190 --> 32:42.994
I DO TRUST XAVIER WANTING ME TO
MOVE FORWARD.

32:43.061 --> 32:47.865
HOWEVER, IF SOMEONE ELSE WINS
THE VETO, THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN

32:47.932 --> 32:48.900
D.

32:48.966 --> 32:50.535
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THEY WERE
ALL THE SAME SIZE!

32:50.601 --> 32:57.175
( SIGHS )
>> WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN HERE?

32:57.241 --> 32:58.309
WHAT'S WRONG?

32:58.376 --> 32:59.944
>> I'M JUST... DISAPPOINTED.

33:00.011 --> 33:02.246
>> OKAY, HEY, LISTEN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.

33:02.313 --> 33:03.514
>> I KNOW.

33:03.581 --> 33:06.951
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WHERE IT'S LIKE IF AZAH WINS THE

33:07.018 --> 33:09.854
VETO, SHE WOULD TAKE EITHER OF
YOU TWO AND SHE WOULDN'T TAKE

33:09.921 --> 33:13.057
ME, AND THAT'S JUST KIND OF HARD
TO-- IT'S JUST A POSITION WHERE

33:13.124 --> 33:18.563
I KNEW, LIKE, OF THE THREE OF US
I PROBABLY NEEDED TO WIN IT THE

33:18.629 --> 33:19.764
MOST.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.434
BUT YOU WILL TAKE ME IF YOU BEAT
AZAH, RIGHT, IF YOU WIN THE

33:23.501 --> 33:24.402
VETO?

33:24.469 --> 33:26.070
>> XAVIER'S H.O.H. AND I'M VERY
HAPPY FOR HIM.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.973
BUT IN REALITY, IT DOESN'T EVEN
COME DOWN TO XAVIER.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.175
IT COMES DOWN TO THE VETO
COMPETITION.

33:31.242 --> 33:35.446
THE VETO COMPETITION IS THE ONLY
WAY TO REALLY SECURE YOUR SPOT

33:35.513 --> 33:36.714
IN THAT TOP THREE.

33:36.781 --> 33:38.015
I NEED YOU TO STAY FOCUSED.

33:38.082 --> 33:38.983
>> I'M FOCUSED.

33:39.050 --> 33:48.192
>> WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH
THIS.

33:48.259 --> 33:55.233
>> ALL RIGHT.

33:55.299 --> 33:57.201
>> WIN WHEN YOU NEED TO.

33:57.268 --> 33:57.902
>> WHAT?

33:57.969 --> 34:00.171
>> WE WIN IT WITH WH WE NEED TO.

34:00.238 --> 34:04.075
>> I THINK THAT'S MY THING RIGHT
NOW IS I'M A LITTLE BIT TRYING

34:04.142 --> 34:06.978
TO PLAY THAT BECAUSE MY WHOLE
THING WITH AZAH IS I KNOW I'M ON

34:07.044 --> 34:08.679
THE BOTTOM OF THIS FOUR, BECAUSE
YOU HAVE FOUR HAVE A MUCH LONGER

34:08.746 --> 34:09.147
RELATIONSHIP.

34:09.213 --> 34:09.781
I DON'T FEEL THAT.

34:09.847 --> 34:10.948
>> YOU'RE GOOD, YOU'RE GOOD.

34:11.015 --> 34:14.519
>> I THINK ANY FEARS KYLAND HAS
ARE COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED,

34:14.585 --> 34:17.555
BECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T WIN THE
VETO, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE HE

34:17.622 --> 34:18.790
COULD GO HOME.

34:18.856 --> 34:21.626
EVEN THOUGH I'VE ENJOYED PLAYING
THIS GAME WITH KYLAND, THERE'S

34:21.692 --> 34:23.261
ONLY SO MUCH THAT THE H.O.H. CAN
DO.

34:23.327 --> 34:28.065
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, IF
YOU DON'T WIN THE VETO, YOUR

34:28.132 --> 34:29.000
GAME IS IN JEOPARDY.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.001
>> I JUST NEED TO WIN THE VETO.

34:30.067 --> 34:30.735
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

34:30.802 --> 34:31.469
>> YEAH.

34:38.543 --> 34:39.143
HOW ARE YOU?

34:39.210 --> 34:40.912
>> I'M DOING GOOD.

34:40.978 --> 34:45.316
JUST TO BE CLEAR, I'M TALKING TO
EVERYBODY TONIGHT TO GET ME TO

34:45.383 --> 34:47.151
WHERE I'M TRYING TO GO.

34:47.218 --> 34:52.924
THIS IS THE STAGE OF THE GAME,
EITHER WAY, EVEN IF I PUT KY UP,

34:52.990 --> 34:57.094
HE'S GOING TO BE SITTING NEXT TO
ONE OF YOU TWO JUST BECAUSE

34:57.161 --> 34:58.229
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.965
>> I KNOW WITH THE MATH IT WILL
DEFINITELYING ONE OF US.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.167
I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF IT IT BE
TWO OF US.

35:03.234 --> 35:04.335
>> I'M NOT SURE.

35:04.402 --> 35:06.504
>> DO YOU HAVE A FINAL TWO WITH
HIM?

35:06.571 --> 35:07.472
>> WITH KY?

35:07.538 --> 35:08.506
>> NO.

35:08.573 --> 35:11.042
>> IF YOU DID, WOULD YOU TELL ME
THE TRUTH, OR NO?

35:11.108 --> 35:11.742
>> MAYBE.

35:11.809 --> 35:14.278
>> OKAY.

35:14.345 --> 35:18.683
>> DO I HAVE A FINAL TWO WITH
KYLAND CALLED THE GENTLEMEN THAT

35:18.749 --> 35:21.853
WE ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE FINAL
SIX?"

35:21.919 --> 35:22.220
WHAT?

35:22.286 --> 35:22.854
YEAH.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.322
AM I GOING TO TELL YOU THAT?

35:24.388 --> 35:26.057
NO.

35:26.123 --> 35:26.524
NOPE.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.059
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.327
SORRY.

35:29.393 --> 35:32.730
I KNOW KY'S MISSION IN THIS GAME
IS TO BRENG A COMPETITOR TO THE

35:32.797 --> 35:33.931
END.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.033
I THOUGHT IF HE WAS GOING TO
TAKE A SHOT AT ME IT WOULD HAVE

35:36.100 --> 35:37.235
BEEN LAST WEEK.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.770
THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T, I GUESS
TELLS ME HE WANTS ME AROUND.

35:39.837 --> 35:43.241
AND THEN HE USED THE VETO ON ME
TODAY.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.442
>> OKAY.

35:44.509 --> 35:48.012
I CAN'T MAKE UPON MY MIND ABOUT
HOW I FEEL ABOUT XAVIER AND

35:48.079 --> 35:49.146
KYLAND.

35:49.213 --> 35:51.349
THIS PUTS ME AND BIG "D" IN A
TRICKY SITUATION, BECAUSE

35:51.415 --> 35:53.684
DEPENDING ON THINGS, WE ARE
PROBABLY GOING TO BE SEPARATED

35:53.751 --> 35:54.752
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.054
I KNOW THAT AT THIS POINT, IT
REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.

35:57.121 --> 35:58.956
IT'S ONLY ABOUT THE VETO.

35:59.023 --> 36:04.929
BUT IF HIS NOMINATIONS CONSIST
OF ME AND BIG "D," I'M GOING TO

36:04.996 --> 36:06.030
FEEL PLAYED.

36:06.097 --> 36:07.932
I'M GOING TO PREPARE MYSELF TO
SEE MY PICTURE TOMORROW.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.700
>> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FORTH COMING
WITH YOU.

36:09.767 --> 36:12.470
>> YOU HAVE BEEN FORTHCOMING.

36:12.537 --> 36:16.374
SO I'LL BE READY.

36:16.440 --> 36:25.049
( LAUGHING )
>> YOU OKAY?

36:25.116 --> 36:26.984
>> YEAH, I'M GOOD.

36:27.051 --> 36:29.921
I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT TO THAT
TOP THREE, AND I'M SCARED.

36:29.987 --> 36:32.623
>> I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
DOWN.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.591
I JUST WON H.O.H.

36:33.658 --> 36:34.458
YOU'RE MAKING TOP THREE.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.394
>> I KNOW THAT, I KNOW THAT, I
KNOW THAT.

36:36.460 --> 36:36.827
>> OKAY.

36:36.894 --> 36:38.062
>> I KNOW THAT.

36:38.129 --> 36:40.932
>> RIGHT NOW I'M JUST KIND OF
EVALUATING WHAT I THINK IS GOING

36:40.998 --> 36:42.833
TO BE THE BEST MOVE FOR MY GAME.

36:42.900 --> 36:46.070
ILOVE ALL YOU GUYS PEOPLE AND
I'M TRYING TO EVALUATE WHAT MOVE

36:46.137 --> 36:48.306
WILL BE BEST AT THIS POINT.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.975
HERE'S WHAT I VIEW AS TWO
OPTIONS.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.178
I PUT OF TWO OF THEM UP.

36:54.245 --> 37:00.084
AND IF I WIN THE VETO, EITHER I
CAN USE IT ON KY, TAKE HIM DOWN,

37:00.151 --> 37:01.052
BUT THEN YOU WILL GO UP.

37:01.118 --> 37:02.253
>> RIGHT.

37:02.320 --> 37:07.058
>> OR I DON'T USE IT, AND AT
THAT JUNCTURE, WE GET TO CHOOSE

37:07.124 --> 37:08.025
WHICH ONE WILL STAY.

37:08.092 --> 37:09.193
>> RIGHT.

37:09.260 --> 37:13.431
>> IF WE GO TO THE FINAL THREE
H.O.H., YOU OR I COULD BEAT

37:13.497 --> 37:14.632
AZAH.

37:14.699 --> 37:21.238
IF WE GO TO THE FINAL THREE
H.O.H., IT'S A TOSS-UP WHO WILL

37:21.305 --> 37:21.939
BEAT KY.

37:22.006 --> 37:22.707
>> I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

37:22.773 --> 37:24.075
>> I WANT YOUR FEEDBACK.

37:24.141 --> 37:27.979
THE PROS OF GETTING OUT KYLAND
THIS WEEK WE KNOCK OUT ONE OF

37:28.045 --> 37:31.282
THE STRONGEST COMPETITORS IN THE
HOUSE THIS SUMMER.

37:31.349 --> 37:34.585
DURING THE CONVERSATION, I WANT
TO PLANT A LITTLE SEED ABOUT THE

37:34.652 --> 37:37.822
POSSIBILITY OF TAKING KYLAND OUT
THIS WEEK.

37:37.888 --> 37:41.258
AND, TRUTHFULLY, IF BIG "D" CUTS
KYLAND THIS WEEK, HE GETS ALL

37:41.325 --> 37:44.662
THE BLOOD ON HIS HANDS, AND
KYLAND HAS NOTHING NEGATIVE TO

37:44.729 --> 37:46.397
SAY ABOUT ME TO THE JURY.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.966
>> HERE'S MY QUESTION: DO YOU
WANT TO TAKE HIM OUT NOW?

37:49.033 --> 37:51.469
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU.

37:51.535 --> 37:54.438
WHICH ONE DO YOU FEEL?

37:54.505 --> 37:58.776
>> XAVIER IS FLOATING THIS IDEA
ABOUT CUTTING KYLAND THIS WEEK,

37:58.843 --> 38:02.113
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

38:02.179 --> 38:06.951
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I DO HAVE MY
TIES WITH KYLAND, AND IT'S JUST

38:07.018 --> 38:13.057
SO HARD TO SEND HOME SOMEONE
THAT YOU LOVE AND DEARLY SO

38:13.124 --> 38:14.258
MUCH.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.927
>> IF THAT FINAL THREE YOU WANT
TO BE WHERE WE HAVE THE BEST

38:16.994 --> 38:19.563
CHANCE OF WINNING, OR DO YOU
WANT IT TO BE A COMPETITIVE

38:19.630 --> 38:19.864
THING?

38:19.930 --> 38:23.668
>> OKAY.

38:23.734 --> 38:24.602
I...

38:24.669 --> 38:26.070
>> IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN THINK
ON TONIGHT.

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

38:27.872 --> 38:30.074
