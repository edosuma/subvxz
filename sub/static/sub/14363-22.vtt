[Crow caws]

00:04.553 --> 00:05.886
Frankie: Date night...

00:05.887 --> 00:07.855
When parents take a
moment away from the kids

00:07.856 --> 00:09.557
to rekindle their passion

00:09.558 --> 00:11.092
and remember why they fell in love.

00:11.093 --> 00:13.160
- [Sighs]
- [Beeping]

00:13.161 --> 00:15.863
No, that one's got shooting in it.

00:15.864 --> 00:17.631
And nothing in the future where
someone's trying to save

00:17.632 --> 00:18.732
some future world or something.

00:18.733 --> 00:20.234
I want movies about now.

00:20.235 --> 00:22.703
Well, if we're making
rules, no period pieces

00:22.704 --> 00:25.206
about a guy in a cape
walking through the fog.

00:25.207 --> 00:26.911
And nothing where somebody gets sick.

00:26.912 --> 00:27.978
No dying.

00:27.979 --> 00:29.944
I wish Billy Crystal would
make another movie.

00:29.945 --> 00:30.945
[Sighs]

00:30.946 --> 00:33.681
Hey, just hold your horses, okay?

00:33.682 --> 00:34.915
We don't usually do date night.

00:34.916 --> 00:37.618
This is kind of a big deal for us.

00:37.619 --> 00:38.986
[Sighs]

00:38.987 --> 00:40.087
"The Hundred-Foot Journey"?

00:40.088 --> 00:41.322
Eh.

00:41.323 --> 00:42.723
"Taken 3"?

00:42.724 --> 00:44.658
No. "Annie"?

00:44.659 --> 00:45.926
Uh-uh.

00:45.927 --> 00:47.161
Okay, we got to pick something.

00:47.162 --> 00:48.162
[Machine chimes]

00:48.163 --> 00:49.730
No, no, no, no! I didn't...

00:49.731 --> 00:50.731
- Oh.
- What?

00:50.732 --> 00:51.899
[Whirring]

00:51.900 --> 00:54.201
Well, I guess we're watching
"The Five Crimes of Eleanor."

00:54.202 --> 00:57.605
Ooh, but it's got that
guy from the thing we like.

00:57.606 --> 00:59.840
So, what do you say, one
more lap around the samples,

00:59.841 --> 01:01.008
and we call it dinner?

01:01.009 --> 01:02.744
You spoil me, baby.

01:04.179 --> 01:08.149
Oh, Sue, there's a package
on the table for you.

01:08.150 --> 01:09.650
Ooh, maybe it's

01:09.651 --> 01:11.218
the "keep calm and eat ice
cream" shirt I ordered.

01:11.219 --> 01:14.088
They finally started making
them in adult sizes!

01:14.089 --> 01:15.089
Mm.

01:15.090 --> 01:17.558
Ahh, got it. [Laughs]

01:17.559 --> 01:20.194
Bow down to me, DVD player.
I am your master.

01:20.195 --> 01:23.664
Mm!

01:23.665 --> 01:26.567

Hey, hey, hey, honey, what's wrong?

01:40.782 --> 01:44.251
[Crying continues]

01:44.252 --> 01:45.686
It's the dress I ordered

01:45.687 --> 01:47.888
when I was gonna go to prom with Darrin.

01:47.889 --> 01:51.225
I am so jealous of my
three-months-ago self!

01:51.226 --> 01:53.260
Oh, Sue.

01:53.261 --> 01:54.695
It's been so hard.

01:54.696 --> 01:57.598
I still really miss him, you know?

01:57.599 --> 01:59.700
Oh, honey, I know.

01:59.701 --> 02:02.670
A-and your dad and I have been so impressed

02:02.671 --> 02:04.572
how you've been holding it together.

02:04.573 --> 02:06.740
But we knew it was bound
to bubble up some time.

02:06.741 --> 02:07.908
Mm.

02:07.909 --> 02:10.344
Ugh, I thought I could bury my feelings

02:10.345 --> 02:13.113
in work and school and
Taylor swift collages,

02:13.114 --> 02:15.683
but I think some feelings are leaking out.

02:15.684 --> 02:17.585
[Sighs] I am just so sad.

02:17.586 --> 02:19.553
Oh.

Mike!

02:21.723 --> 02:23.057
- What?
- [TV shuts off]

02:23.058 --> 02:24.758
She's sad she can't go to prom.

02:24.759 --> 02:26.160
I thought we covered it.

02:26.161 --> 02:27.194
[Sighs]

02:27.195 --> 02:29.330
Look, you can still go, you know?

02:29.331 --> 02:31.765
It's your senior prom. You have to go.

02:31.766 --> 02:33.567
No, it's a date thing,

02:33.568 --> 02:35.169
and, ugh, there's no one I want to go with.

02:35.170 --> 02:36.170
What about Brad?

02:36.171 --> 02:37.638
No, he got asked by Tammy,

02:37.639 --> 02:39.573
the captain of the field hockey team.

02:39.574 --> 02:41.141
They're both going in tuxes.

02:41.142 --> 02:42.743
[Chuckles] They're so funny.

02:42.744 --> 02:44.845
No. It's over.

02:44.846 --> 02:46.647
Prom doesn't mean anything anymore.

02:46.648 --> 02:50.284
The year of Sue is turning
into the year of suck.

02:50.285 --> 02:51.920
[Sobs]

02:54.689 --> 02:56.890
[Scoffs] Okay, now.

- [Beep]

02:59.628 --> 03:01.595
Unfortunately, date night ended

03:01.596 --> 03:03.731
a little earlier than we planned.

03:03.732 --> 03:05.699
- Man: There's time for all that later...
- [Both snoring]

03:05.700 --> 03:07.735
But right now, what will you be drinking?

03:07.736 --> 03:10.971
Thank you for choosing Spudsy's
for all your potato needs.

03:10.972 --> 03:13.340
Hey, Logan. Welcome to Spudsy's.

03:13.341 --> 03:14.775
You know what they say.

03:14.776 --> 03:17.011
April potatoes bring May potatoes.

03:17.012 --> 03:18.746
I'm sorry.

03:18.747 --> 03:21.315
I know it's lame, but I'll get
written up if I don't say it.

03:21.316 --> 03:23.751
- [Laughs] You want the usual?
- Uh, yeah, thanks.

03:23.752 --> 03:25.586
So, how are things at Abercrombie?

03:25.587 --> 03:26.654
[Inhales sharply] Cold.

03:26.655 --> 03:28.722
I keep telling the store they
got to heat it up in there,

03:28.723 --> 03:29.957
but they're not really interested

03:29.958 --> 03:31.625
- in what the greeters have to say, so...
- [laughs] Yeah.

03:31.626 --> 03:32.626
How are you doing?

03:32.627 --> 03:35.029
Well, I'm feeling a little
down, but don't worry.

03:35.030 --> 03:36.563
It won't affect your potato.

03:36.564 --> 03:37.564
Oh.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.800
[Chuckles]

03:39.801 --> 03:41.568
There you are.

03:41.569 --> 03:44.338
- [Register beeps, opens]
- Oh.

03:44.339 --> 03:45.906
Thank you for choosing Spudsy's.

03:45.907 --> 03:47.908
Thank you.

03:49.554 --> 03:50.844
Sue, a moment.

03:50.845 --> 03:52.112
Sure.

03:52.113 --> 03:54.581
Listen, I'm gonna need you
to work this Saturday

03:54.582 --> 03:55.849
'cause it's prom.

03:55.850 --> 03:58.585
I worked last year when you
blew me off at the last minute,

03:58.586 --> 03:59.653
but I can't this year.

03:59.654 --> 04:01.588
I'm taking the hottest girl in school.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.090
Well, maybe not the whole school,

04:03.091 --> 04:05.160
but in madrigals, definitely.

04:08.763 --> 04:10.130
Great.

04:10.131 --> 04:14.101
Okay. Date night number two.

04:14.102 --> 04:16.269
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's try this again.

04:16.271 --> 04:18.572
So, do you remember what
happened before we fell asleep?

04:18.572 --> 04:19.973
I remember the guy said,

04:19.974 --> 04:21.208
"Come with me. This is dangerous."

04:21.209 --> 04:23.911
And the girl says, "I can't leave my home."

04:23.912 --> 04:25.946
And he says, "you must."

04:25.947 --> 04:27.548
What?

04:27.549 --> 04:29.550
What are you talking about?
That wasn't even in the movie.

04:29.551 --> 04:30.584
How do you know? You were asleep.

04:30.585 --> 04:32.019
[Sighs] All right.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.320
Well, I guess we're gonna have
to start at the beginning.

04:33.321 --> 04:34.621
Ahh.

04:34.622 --> 04:35.856
- [Beep]
- [Slow-tempo music plays]

04:35.857 --> 04:36.857
Mm, you smell good.

04:36.858 --> 04:38.225
Sour cream and onion?

04:38.226 --> 04:39.626
Yeah, I had some chips.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.195
I had to. What was that dinner?

04:41.196 --> 04:42.596
I don't know.

04:42.597 --> 04:44.965
That bag was in the freezer so
long, the lettering came off.

04:44.966 --> 04:46.567
Might have been a cold pack.

04:46.568 --> 04:49.670
Mm-hmm.

04:49.671 --> 04:52.139
Axl: I'm telling ya, I'm
thinking too small.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.141
I am an idea guy,

04:54.142 --> 04:56.110
and I've been ignoring
my greatest resource.

04:56.111 --> 04:57.211
[Pops lips]

04:57.212 --> 04:58.345
I mean, don't get me wrong.

04:58.346 --> 05:00.013
Boss Co. is a groundbreaking
company and all,

05:00.014 --> 05:01.315
but it's been holding me back.

05:01.316 --> 05:03.050
I mean, Darrin's got his
air-conditioning thing,

05:03.051 --> 05:05.586
and Sean's pre-med now, but
where's that gonna get him?

05:05.587 --> 05:07.589
Uh, can you hand me those
soy-sauce packets?

05:12.694 --> 05:14.561
What are you doing?

05:14.562 --> 05:16.330
Well, mom said I couldn't leave the kitchen

05:16.331 --> 05:17.865
till I finished eating my dinner.

05:17.866 --> 05:20.734
So I'm coming up with a sauce
that'll make her cooking edible.

05:20.735 --> 05:21.836
Mm.

05:25.106 --> 05:26.173
[Sniffs]

05:26.174 --> 05:27.741
Hey. That's pretty good.

05:27.742 --> 05:29.209
But the real test, though, huh?

05:29.210 --> 05:30.644
Put it on mom's food.

05:30.645 --> 05:31.780
[Laughs]

05:33.748 --> 05:36.083
Holy crap, you can't even taste the food.
You know what?

05:36.084 --> 05:37.184
[Inhales deeply]

05:37.185 --> 05:38.685
This could be something.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.654
This is my next big idea.

05:40.655 --> 05:42.222
It's my big idea.

05:42.223 --> 05:43.857
It's our big idea.

05:43.858 --> 05:47.227
"Heck Brothers Old-timey Cover-up sauce."

05:47.228 --> 05:50.330
Heck Brothers, yeah. I like it.

05:50.331 --> 05:52.933
But I'm not too sure about
the name "cover-up sauce."

05:52.934 --> 05:55.702
From my brief experience working
for the pretzel people,

05:55.703 --> 05:58.071
I can tell you that might
not be the best idea.

05:58.072 --> 06:01.643
Well, then, let's product-test it.

06:03.645 --> 06:06.613
Here. Taste this.

06:06.614 --> 06:09.183
Oh, brick, I am not going to eat something

06:09.184 --> 06:10.751
when I don't even know what it is.

06:10.752 --> 06:13.688
You make us do it all the time.

06:17.158 --> 06:19.026
Mm. That is good.

06:19.027 --> 06:20.627
Where'd you get the barbecue sauce?

06:20.628 --> 06:21.862
That's what it is!

06:21.863 --> 06:24.598
"Heck Brothers Old-timey Barbecue Sauce."

06:24.599 --> 06:25.599
Yeah!

06:25.600 --> 06:27.267
Unh! [Laughs]

06:27.268 --> 06:29.169
Man: Makes me nervous.
There's no stopping you.

06:29.170 --> 06:30.270
Woman: Oh, my!

06:30.271 --> 06:31.705
Do you understand what just happened?

06:31.706 --> 06:33.674
I don't care, as long as
they're not fighting.

06:33.675 --> 06:37.644
No, in the movie. Is he kidnapping her?

06:37.645 --> 06:41.615
No, she's the bad guy.
Gary Cooper is the good guy.

06:41.616 --> 06:43.617
Gary Cooper's been dead for 50 years.

06:43.618 --> 06:45.986
No, he was in "The Hangover."

06:45.987 --> 06:47.221
Bradley Cooper.

06:47.222 --> 06:48.589
That's what I meant.

06:48.590 --> 06:50.657
If you don't know that
when I say Gary Cooper,

06:50.658 --> 06:52.960
I mean Bradley Cooper,
then, like, what is this?

06:52.961 --> 06:55.662
Let's just go back.

06:55.663 --> 06:58.699

- [Both snoring]

07:06.674 --> 07:11.111
So, did our potato put
a smile on your face?

07:11.112 --> 07:12.579
Sorry, we have to say that, too.

07:12.580 --> 07:13.747
[Laughs]

07:13.748 --> 07:16.583
[Laughs] Oh, your dress is so cute.

07:16.584 --> 07:17.718
Thanks. I love it so much.

07:17.719 --> 07:19.653
Ugh. Prom.

07:19.654 --> 07:22.322
Did you have a bad time at yours?

07:22.323 --> 07:24.925
That would be an understatement.

07:24.926 --> 07:26.260
St. Timothy's prom was last month.

07:26.261 --> 07:28.262
My date got drunk and threw up on a nun.

07:28.263 --> 07:29.630
- Eeeh.
- [Laughs]

07:29.631 --> 07:30.898
They say everything goes with black.

07:30.899 --> 07:31.899
Not true.

07:31.900 --> 07:32.900
[Both laugh]

07:32.901 --> 07:34.635
Yeah, mine's on Saturday.

07:34.636 --> 07:36.169
I was supposed to go with my boyfriend,

07:36.170 --> 07:37.738
but then he asked me to marry him,

07:37.739 --> 07:38.739
and we ended up breaking up.

07:38.740 --> 07:41.608
Wow, that's rough.

07:41.609 --> 07:44.678
So, uh... so you're not going to your prom?

07:44.679 --> 07:47.347
Well, it's your senior year. You got to go.

07:47.348 --> 07:50.250
Eh, I'll probably just work here, close up,

07:50.251 --> 07:53.754
go home, and watch a movie with my parents.

07:53.755 --> 07:57.755
Well, uh, maybe you could go
with someone you already know.

07:58.693 --> 08:01.628
No, all my friends are already
going with dates already.

08:01.629 --> 08:04.231
What about a friend from another school?

08:04.232 --> 08:05.766
[Laughs]

08:05.767 --> 08:07.601
When do I have time to meet
someone from another school?

08:07.602 --> 08:10.704
Someone you sell potatoes to?

08:10.705 --> 08:12.005
Earl the security guard?

08:12.006 --> 08:14.741
Okay, somebody you already
know from another school

08:14.742 --> 08:16.311
who you sell potatoes to.

08:18.746 --> 08:20.981
You? Really? Are you serious?

08:20.982 --> 08:23.050
You'd really go to my... my prom with me?

08:23.051 --> 08:24.585
Hey, my first prom was a disaster.

08:24.586 --> 08:26.219
I might as well give it another shot.

08:26.220 --> 08:29.056
O-okay, well, then, yes. [Laughs]

08:29.057 --> 08:30.557
Yes, I'll go with you.

08:30.558 --> 08:32.558
Okay.

08:32.559 --> 08:33.695
[Laughs] We're going to prom!

08:37.332 --> 08:38.599
Well, would you like to try

08:38.600 --> 08:40.767
some of our Heck Brothers
Old-timey Barbecue sauce?

08:40.768 --> 08:43.070
Goes on anything. It'd even
make a rat taste good.

08:43.071 --> 08:45.072
Mnh-mnh.

08:45.073 --> 08:46.573
[Sighs]

08:46.574 --> 08:47.874
All right, how about you just
let me talk from now on?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.676
All right, look, you're the inventor.

08:49.677 --> 08:50.711
I'm the marketing genius.

08:50.712 --> 08:52.045
Let's just stick to our strengths.

08:52.046 --> 08:53.714
So what do I do, then?

08:53.715 --> 08:56.550
Well, if you have to talk,
wait until I say something,

08:56.551 --> 08:57.751
then say, "you got that right."

08:57.752 --> 08:59.219
It's an old-timey thing, you know?

08:59.220 --> 09:00.687
If you're really feeling it,

09:00.688 --> 09:02.189
throw in a "darn tootin'" now and then.

09:02.190 --> 09:04.558
Get your Heck Brothers
Old-timey Barbecue sauce.

09:04.559 --> 09:07.561
So fresh, tastes like it was made
yesterday in your mom's kitchen.

09:07.562 --> 09:08.662
Got that right.

09:08.663 --> 09:10.231
So fresh, it could cover a rat.

09:13.001 --> 09:14.635
What is it with you and the rat, brick?

09:14.636 --> 09:16.303
Look, we're not just selling
barbecue sauce here.

09:16.304 --> 09:18.205
We are developing our brand.

09:18.206 --> 09:20.040
We're selling a lifestyle...

09:20.041 --> 09:22.142
Clothing, sunglasses, wakeboards.

09:22.143 --> 09:23.677
- Mm.
- You, sir!

09:23.678 --> 09:26.613
You look like a man who appreciates

09:26.614 --> 09:27.748
the finer things in life.

09:27.749 --> 09:28.949
Would you care to sample

09:28.950 --> 09:31.653
our Heck Brothers old-timey barbecue sauce?

09:33.254 --> 09:35.288
Mm! Not bad.

09:35.289 --> 09:36.590
How much?

09:36.591 --> 09:38.558
$30.

09:38.559 --> 09:39.960
$3!

09:39.961 --> 09:40.994
No!

09:40.995 --> 09:42.229
I meant $3!

09:42.230 --> 09:45.198
$3. Ugh.

09:45.199 --> 09:47.334
[Laughs]

09:47.335 --> 09:48.335
Mom, guess what.

09:48.336 --> 09:49.603
Everyone who's going to prom

09:49.604 --> 09:51.171
with an adorable Abercrombie greeter,

09:51.172 --> 09:52.639
raise your hand!

09:52.640 --> 09:54.007
That would be me!

09:54.008 --> 09:57.644
Oh, that's great. Oh, who is he?

09:57.645 --> 09:59.646
[Sighs] It's my friend, Logan.

09:59.647 --> 10:02.849
He goes to catholic school. He's polite.
He holds doors.

10:02.850 --> 10:04.251
He throws away his scraps

10:04.252 --> 10:07.320
and returns his tray to the
top of the garbage can.

10:07.321 --> 10:09.222
Can you believe he's
nice enough to take me?

10:09.223 --> 10:12.225
Oh, I'm so happy you have a date.

10:12.226 --> 10:15.996
Oh, seriously, enjoy
this time in your life.

10:15.997 --> 10:18.732
In the blink of an eye,
you're waking up at 4:00 A.M.

10:18.733 --> 10:21.134
In a pool of drool on your
husband's flannel shirt.

10:21.135 --> 10:22.637
Seriously, enjoy it.

10:26.007 --> 10:29.076
Whoo! Whoo!

10:29.077 --> 10:31.745
Aah!

10:31.746 --> 10:34.681
Sue Heck is going to prom! [Laughs]

10:34.682 --> 10:37.617
[Knock on door]

10:37.618 --> 10:41.188
Surprise, Susie Q, I've got good news.

10:41.189 --> 10:43.323
Someone I know is going to her prom.

10:43.324 --> 10:44.324
What?

10:44.325 --> 10:45.559
My mom was talking to your mom,

10:45.560 --> 10:46.560
and she said you didn't have a date,

10:46.561 --> 10:47.828
so I rescheduled a test

10:47.829 --> 10:50.130
and bailed on the intramural
flag football championship

10:50.131 --> 10:51.998
and drove straight down
here from Notre Dame

10:51.999 --> 10:54.067
'cause I was not about to let Sue Heck

10:54.068 --> 10:55.669
not go to her senior prom.

10:55.670 --> 10:59.272
Oh, um, Sean, that is so nice.

10:59.273 --> 11:01.608
So nice.

11:01.609 --> 11:04.311
But someone I work with
actually asked me to prom,

11:04.312 --> 11:06.614
and I said yes!

11:08.649 --> 11:10.917
Oh! Okay.

11:10.918 --> 11:12.586
That's fine. I'll just drive back.

11:12.587 --> 11:14.254
I might stop by and have a
little chat with my mom

11:14.255 --> 11:17.591
about communication
first, but it's all good.

11:17.592 --> 11:19.259
The important thing is,
you're going to prom

11:19.260 --> 11:20.327
with someone else.

11:20.328 --> 11:23.797
I am so, so sorry. I really...

11:23.798 --> 11:25.799
No, that's okay. I'm a Donahue.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.269
I will smile through this 'cause
we smile through everything.

11:29.270 --> 11:33.270
Okay, well, um, I'm so sorry, again.

11:33.775 --> 11:35.041
I'm so sorry.

11:35.042 --> 11:37.878
That was so nice. Sorry.

11:37.879 --> 11:40.680
Mom!

11:40.681 --> 11:42.616
- [Both snoring]
- Man: It is too dangerous.

11:42.617 --> 11:44.651
Woman: Too dangerous for you.

11:44.652 --> 11:46.153
- [Door bangs]
- I'm okay!

11:46.154 --> 11:48.121
It's official... we are a success.

11:48.122 --> 11:49.756
We sold all of our barbecue sauce.

11:49.757 --> 11:50.957
Brick: Got that right.

11:50.958 --> 11:52.659
That's our slogan. It's old-timey.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.594
We had a good rat one, too,

11:54.595 --> 11:56.997
but it's on the back burner for now.

11:56.998 --> 12:00.600
[Sighs]

12:00.601 --> 12:02.002
Why are they skiing?

12:02.003 --> 12:04.337
Go back.

12:04.338 --> 12:06.306
[Sighs]

12:06.307 --> 12:09.576
Now, what you want is eye-level placement.

12:09.577 --> 12:11.144
That's your premium shelf.

12:11.145 --> 12:12.145
Huh.

12:12.146 --> 12:13.847
I'm gonna turn these bottles around

12:13.848 --> 12:15.315
so that way, people can't read the labels.

12:15.316 --> 12:16.550
Now you're getting it, brick.

12:16.551 --> 12:17.551
Yeah.

12:17.552 --> 12:18.785
Excuse me. What are you doing?

12:18.786 --> 12:20.821
Hi, I'm Axl Heck.

12:20.822 --> 12:24.090
We just happen to have the best
barbecue sauce money can buy,

12:24.091 --> 12:26.092
and we have chosen the frugal Hoosier

12:26.093 --> 12:28.595
as the flagship provider for our launch

12:28.596 --> 12:31.731
of Heck Brothers Old-timey Barbecue sauce.

12:31.732 --> 12:33.723
We sold 11 jars of the
stuff at the swap meet,

12:33.724 --> 12:34.803
so you know it's good.

12:34.804 --> 12:36.203
Yeah, I don't know what
you think you're doing,

12:36.204 --> 12:37.270
but there is a process

12:37.271 --> 12:38.805
to getting your food on the shelves.

12:38.806 --> 12:40.707
Is this stuff even FDA approved?

12:40.708 --> 12:42.576
I'm sorry. I thought this was America.

12:42.577 --> 12:43.710
Darn tootin'.

12:43.711 --> 12:45.612
Woman: Clark to register two, please.

12:45.613 --> 12:46.913
Clark to register two.

12:46.914 --> 12:48.348
It's sticking again.

12:48.349 --> 12:49.684
Pack it up, fellas.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.654
Ah, ch, ch, ch, ch.

12:56.224 --> 12:57.724
- Hello, sir.
- Hmm?

12:57.725 --> 12:59.926
Are you shopping for barbecue sauce?

12:59.927 --> 13:02.796
Indeed I am, but there's
just so many choices.

13:02.797 --> 13:04.564
Hmm, well, I can tell you

13:04.565 --> 13:07.801
the best barbecue sauce I've
ever tasted is this one.

13:07.802 --> 13:10.303
Heck Brothers Old-timey Barbecue sauce.

13:10.304 --> 13:13.039
- Hmm, I do love a good family business.
- Mm.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.309
But I notice some of these
other sauces are FDA approved.

13:16.310 --> 13:18.111
Oh, they're FDA approved, all right,

13:18.112 --> 13:19.646
but if you're anything like me,

13:19.647 --> 13:22.082
you want the government out
of your barbecue sauce.

13:22.083 --> 13:24.951
As soon as the government goes
in, the flavor comes out.

13:24.952 --> 13:26.920
That certainly makes a lot of sense to me.

13:26.921 --> 13:28.588
I'm going to buy two bottles.

13:28.589 --> 13:30.790
Hmm.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.959
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.128
Uh, you don't pay for that at the register.

13:35.129 --> 13:37.231
It's old-timey. You pay
for it in the alley.

13:38.566 --> 13:40.100
Hmm.

13:40.101 --> 13:42.202
So, now that I'm going to prom,

13:42.203 --> 13:44.871
I was wondering if you
could cover my shift.

13:44.872 --> 13:46.940
Oh, when did you get fired?

13:46.941 --> 13:48.875
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:48.876 --> 13:50.710
I-I agree the slogans are corny,

13:50.711 --> 13:52.646
but you did sign the potato pledge.

13:52.647 --> 13:54.047
Looks like we're out of mustard.

13:54.048 --> 13:55.081
Well, I'll put it on the list.

13:55.082 --> 13:56.716
And put Froot Loops on there, too.

13:56.717 --> 13:57.951
They're not in my barbecue sauce.

13:57.952 --> 14:00.020
I know, but I like them, and I
don't have any up at school.

14:00.021 --> 14:01.221
Mm.

14:01.222 --> 14:03.323
[Door opens, closes] Oh, good. You're home.

14:03.324 --> 14:06.059
Okay, so, I made us a chart
of what we can piece together

14:06.060 --> 14:07.894
from the movie so we don't have
to start from the beginning.

14:07.895 --> 14:10.697
Or we can just not watch the movie at all.

14:10.698 --> 14:12.732
Mike, it's date night.

14:12.733 --> 14:14.567
I think we're working too hard for this.

14:14.568 --> 14:16.670
Didn't we get married so we
didn't have to work this hard?

14:16.671 --> 14:18.571
We know what the goal of date night is.

14:18.572 --> 14:20.707
Let's just do that and go to sleep happy.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.609
Okay, Mike, that is so unromantic.

14:22.610 --> 14:24.110
Just study the damn chart,

14:24.111 --> 14:26.641
and we'll get there when we get there.

14:27.438 --> 14:31.254
So, Becca, just how
inflamed is your spleen?

14:31.255 --> 14:32.772
Axl: Listen, you guys
heading out right now,

14:32.773 --> 14:34.621
'cause me and brick need
some things from the store.

14:34.622 --> 14:37.657
10 bottles of ketchup,
3 packs of pixy stix,

14:37.658 --> 14:39.592
a jar of peanut butter, preferably creamy.

14:39.593 --> 14:41.628
Okay, I hate to break it
to you, Heck Brothers,

14:41.629 --> 14:43.997
but you can buy your own supplies.

14:43.998 --> 14:46.700
Oh, my god. You are so not
supportive of our endeavors.

14:46.701 --> 14:48.301
This is a rock-solid business model.

14:48.302 --> 14:51.171
Everything we're raking in is pure profit.

14:51.172 --> 14:53.907
Pure profit 'cause you're using
our ingredients and our jars.

14:53.908 --> 14:56.609
Once you two clowns start
paying for your own supplies,

14:56.610 --> 14:58.611
you'll see how difficult it is
to actually run a business.

14:58.612 --> 15:00.747
Okay, fine, we won't use the jars.

15:00.748 --> 15:04.117
We'll use, uh, Ziploc bags.
We'll be a green company.

15:04.118 --> 15:05.752
People can refill them.

15:05.753 --> 15:07.153
Got any more nos you want us
to turn into opportunities?

15:07.154 --> 15:09.622
Sue: Please! You're my last hope!

15:09.623 --> 15:11.725
I mean, there's no one else left to call!

15:11.726 --> 15:12.726
Come on!

15:12.727 --> 15:14.594
You can check into rehab any day.

15:14.595 --> 15:16.830
[Dial tone]

15:16.831 --> 15:17.831
[Telephone beeps]

15:17.832 --> 15:19.632
[Grunts]

15:19.633 --> 15:21.135
[Sobbing]

15:27.742 --> 15:30.210
Okay. Okay, I am just about ready to close.

15:30.211 --> 15:32.345
We're pretty late,

15:32.346 --> 15:34.714
but there will still be
plenty of time for dancing,

15:34.715 --> 15:36.549
so I'm just gonna go in the
back and change into my dress

15:36.550 --> 15:37.751
so we can get out of here right at 9:00.

15:37.752 --> 15:38.885
Sounds like a plan.

15:38.886 --> 15:42.022
Thank you so much for this.

15:42.023 --> 15:45.091
And can I just say, I didn't
think it was possible,

15:45.092 --> 15:48.261
but you look even better in clothes.

15:48.262 --> 15:49.829
Ah. Come on.

15:49.830 --> 15:52.032
[Laughs]

15:52.033 --> 15:54.601
If someone throws you a knife,
you catch it by the handle.

15:54.602 --> 15:57.070
What did I say about stabbing your brother?

15:57.071 --> 15:58.038
I was trying to help him.

15:58.039 --> 15:59.239
He needed it to cut onions,

15:59.240 --> 16:01.307
but now he's telling me he
can't remember the recipe

16:01.308 --> 16:03.243
for our awesome barbecue sauce.

16:03.244 --> 16:06.212
I'm sorry. I was in the
creative zone the first time.

16:06.213 --> 16:07.914
I just went with the flow.

16:07.915 --> 16:09.983
All right, you know what? I'm a
marketing guy. I can work with this.

16:09.984 --> 16:10.984
Uh...

16:10.985 --> 16:13.019
[Snaps fingers]

16:13.020 --> 16:14.687
So homemade, it tastes
different every time.

16:14.688 --> 16:15.922
Brick, write that down.

16:15.923 --> 16:18.258
Okay, Axl, you've wasted
enough time on this.

16:18.259 --> 16:20.160
Don't you have some schoolwork
you should be doing?

16:20.161 --> 16:21.661
How should I know? I haven't been to class.

16:21.662 --> 16:22.896
[Scoffs] What?

16:22.897 --> 16:25.698
Dad, this is more important than any class.

16:25.699 --> 16:28.034
At a certain point, a person
learns all they need to know,

16:28.035 --> 16:29.769
and classes just get in the way.

16:29.770 --> 16:30.804
As a matter of fact,

16:30.805 --> 16:32.839
I might not even be going
back to college in the fall.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.707
Oh, you'll be going back to college

16:34.708 --> 16:35.708
a lot sooner than the fall.

16:35.709 --> 16:36.709
You're going tomorrow.

16:36.710 --> 16:38.745
Come on, think about all the people

16:38.746 --> 16:40.613
who dropped out of college and made it big.

16:40.614 --> 16:41.915
- Mark Zuckerberg...
- Mm-hmm.

16:41.916 --> 16:44.250
Bill Gates, Jean-Claude Van Damme.

16:44.251 --> 16:45.618
There's a lot of highway between

16:45.619 --> 16:47.220
a computer that changes the world

16:47.221 --> 16:49.022
and barbecue sauce in a bag.

16:49.023 --> 16:50.757
We sold 20 jars of this barbecue sauce,

16:50.758 --> 16:53.026
so if that's not a sign I
should drop out of college,

16:53.027 --> 16:54.094
I don't know what is.

16:54.095 --> 16:56.162
Yeah, well...

16:56.163 --> 16:58.665
Take this is a sign that
that's not happening.

16:58.666 --> 16:59.699
What...

16:59.700 --> 17:01.000
Heck Brothers are done.

17:01.001 --> 17:02.869
If Paul Newman had you for a dad,

17:02.870 --> 17:04.737
he never would have
invented salad dressing,

17:04.738 --> 17:05.839
and no one would know who he is.

17:05.839 --> 17:06.940
Dream squasher!

17:06.941 --> 17:10.777
[Sighs]

17:10.778 --> 17:12.679
Sue: Thank you so much for helping.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.347
You really saved us some time.

17:14.348 --> 17:16.583
No problem.

17:16.584 --> 17:18.818
Okay. Whew.

17:18.819 --> 17:19.919
I'm ready!

17:19.920 --> 17:22.789
[Sighs]

17:22.790 --> 17:23.857
Wow.

17:23.858 --> 17:27.594
You, uh... you look really pretty.

17:27.595 --> 17:29.796
Thank you.

17:29.797 --> 17:31.664
You look really pretty, too.

17:31.665 --> 17:33.600
Oh.

17:33.601 --> 17:35.735
Well, should we go?

17:35.736 --> 17:37.604
Yeah. I want to get there
and get a picture of you.

17:37.605 --> 17:39.639
I mean, of us. [Chuckles]

17:39.640 --> 17:42.008
- I just need to shut everything down.
- Okay.

17:42.009 --> 17:43.744
Okay.

17:47.248 --> 17:48.281
Ahh.

17:48.282 --> 17:49.582
Mm.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.618
[Sighs] This one always gives me problems.

17:51.619 --> 17:53.554
Oh.

17:55.222 --> 17:56.322
Oh! Oh, no.

17:56.323 --> 17:58.324
Oh, no, no, no. Okay.

17:58.325 --> 18:00.560
Oh, no, no! No!

18:00.561 --> 18:01.661
Uh...

18:01.662 --> 18:02.696
[Gasps]

18:04.298 --> 18:06.166
Uh... no, no, stay back!

18:06.167 --> 18:07.800
You're too pretty! I don't
want you to get dirty.

18:07.801 --> 18:09.669
Uh, I'll, uh, get a bucket.

18:09.670 --> 18:10.937
Yeah. No, no. No!

18:10.938 --> 18:12.906
Oh, god. Aah!

18:12.907 --> 18:14.207
Aah!

18:14.208 --> 18:15.842
Are you kidding me?!

18:15.843 --> 18:16.844
Oh!

18:19.647 --> 18:21.047
Aah!

18:21.048 --> 18:23.283
Stop, please.

18:23.284 --> 18:24.617
Oh, my...

18:24.618 --> 18:25.753
Oh!

18:27.755 --> 18:29.656
You know, there's a million books

18:29.657 --> 18:31.157
about how to deal with your kids,

18:31.158 --> 18:33.593
but there's no books about how
to deal with your parents.

18:33.594 --> 18:36.696
Hey, you might be onto something.

18:36.697 --> 18:38.932
Forget barbecue sauce. That
could be our next project.

18:38.933 --> 18:41.601
- Really?
- Yeah. You like books.

18:41.602 --> 18:43.703
You could write it, and I'd
look good on the cover.

18:43.704 --> 18:46.973
"How to Deal with your Problem
Parents" by the Heck Brothers.

18:46.974 --> 18:49.576
"Chapter one... Living
with a Dream Squasher."

18:49.577 --> 18:51.344
- Mm-hmm.
- [Laughs]

18:51.345 --> 18:53.613
"Chapter two... Living with a Nag."

18:53.614 --> 18:55.181
- That's mom.
- Yeah.

18:55.182 --> 18:57.617
"Chapter three... Living with
a Nag and a Dream Squasher."

18:57.618 --> 18:58.985
So, both of them.

18:58.986 --> 19:01.721
I can't believe this!

19:01.722 --> 19:03.590
You were so nice to me,

19:03.591 --> 19:04.958
and you offered to take me to prom,

19:04.959 --> 19:06.993
and you rented a tux, and now...

19:06.994 --> 19:08.628
[laughs]

19:08.629 --> 19:10.230
I'm sorry.

19:10.231 --> 19:11.764
I'm having a great time.

19:11.765 --> 19:14.701
Still way better than
cleaning up an angry nun.

19:14.702 --> 19:15.768
[Chuckles]

19:15.769 --> 19:18.071
Okay, maybe we're just not destined

19:18.072 --> 19:19.339
to have any luck with proms.

19:19.340 --> 19:20.340
We're 0 for 2.

19:20.341 --> 19:23.042
Not necessarily.

19:23.043 --> 19:25.812
Got a fountain. Dance floor.

19:25.813 --> 19:27.280
[Laughs]

19:27.281 --> 19:28.781
Would you like to dance?

19:28.782 --> 19:31.117
Oh, no.

19:31.118 --> 19:33.953
Ugh. I'm all... and you're all...

19:33.954 --> 19:36.823
You don't have to do all that just for me.

19:36.824 --> 19:39.959
Sue [Chuckles] don't you get it?

19:39.960 --> 19:43.730
Why do you think I come
into Spudsy's every day?

19:43.731 --> 19:46.360

They're making these movies too long.

I'm telling you... we should just watch TV.
