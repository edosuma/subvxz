08:14.972 --> 08:17.975
now feeling
like I'm participating

08:18.019 --> 08:20.848
in something that is
making somebody look stupid.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.893
- You guys, can I get
a glass of wine?

08:22.937 --> 08:24.155
Thank you.
Are you okay?

08:24.199 --> 08:26.549
- Yes.
- Okay, what happened?

08:26.593 --> 08:29.639
- Okay, it's weird for me that
Shannon comes to this party,

08:29.683 --> 08:31.815
and she's acting like
everything's completely normal.

08:31.859 --> 08:34.644
Prior to meeting you, I didn't
know anything about you.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.298
- Let's just go
let's just walk over here.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.734
- Let's sit.
- Let's just sit for a second.

08:37.778 --> 08:40.955
- Let's sit here, okay.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.130
Okay.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.566
- What happened?

08:43.610 --> 08:46.177
- I feel uncomfortable
because Shannon didn't know

08:46.221 --> 08:48.702
if Nicole was the same girl
that she knew previously.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.573
- Right, I knew that.

08:50.617 --> 08:55.578
- Prior to that, she said that
Nicole had sued your husband.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.362
Honestly, Heather,
the whole thing is so absurd.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.016
We wanted nothing
to do with it.

08:59.060 --> 09:02.193
But if Shannon is
saying these things,

09:02.237 --> 09:05.022
and if, outside shot,
it was true,

09:05.066 --> 09:07.198
and somehow you didn't
know this,

09:07.242 --> 09:09.244
I thought then you looked
a little silly being like,

09:09.287 --> 09:11.246
"Nicole's so great,
Nicole's so great,"

09:11.289 --> 09:13.857
and yet she perhaps
did something

09:13.901 --> 09:15.250
that was not cool
to your family.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.904
- Right.

09:16.947 --> 09:20.908
- I am uncertain at this point
what I even look like.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.867
- Right.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.216
- Wait, let me
ask you something.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.827
- Yeah?

09:26.870 --> 09:31.875
- Did you ever
tell Heather?

09:31.919 --> 09:34.965
- They are not--that
is so not okay.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.054
- It's--because you know why?

09:37.098 --> 09:39.143
Because Gina is talking
to Heather right now.

09:39.187 --> 09:44.061
- Wow, no, of course I didn't.
No, I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

09:44.105 --> 09:47.891
And I told you guys that, and
you guys Kumbaya promised me.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.893
- Can you tell me
what you're talking about?

09:49.937 --> 09:51.286
- You know what, Shannon,
I did promise you,

09:51.329 --> 09:52.853
and I didn't say a word.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.898
But you made it a thing,
and now it's a thing now.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.073
- I need
to go talk to my friend

09:56.117 --> 09:57.422
who I then don't want to hurt.

09:57.466 --> 09:58.728
- Then you should do that.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.251
Then you should do that,
Shannon.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.731
- I'm trying to do that.
- I'm giving you a heads up.

10:01.775 --> 10:02.863
- Okay.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.212
- Then you should
do that, Shannon.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.083
- This is unbelievable.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.389
<i>We made a promise</i>

10:07.432 --> 10:09.347
that if this is
the same Nicole,

10:09.391 --> 10:11.698
nobody's talking about it,

10:11.741 --> 10:13.874
and I'm the dumb sh--
to trust people.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.919
- I just felt like you should
have this information

10:15.963 --> 10:17.268
'cause I don't really know
what Shannon was planning

10:17.312 --> 10:19.662
on doing with it,
not playing on do with it,

10:19.706 --> 10:22.186
what her end game was,
or goal, but I just said--

10:22.230 --> 10:24.188
- Are you kidding me
right now, Gina?

10:24.232 --> 10:25.886
I have to talk to you, Heather.

10:25.929 --> 10:28.758
I don't wanna hurt anybody
in this world.

10:28.802 --> 10:32.153
And when you kept telling me
that Nicole was your friend,

10:32.196 --> 10:35.939
I said, "I think I know her,
but it can't be that girl,"

10:35.983 --> 10:38.463
because the Nicole
that I knew told me

10:38.507 --> 10:41.118
that she was in a lawsuit
with Terry.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.207
So that doesn't make sense to
me that they would be friends.

10:43.251 --> 10:46.036
- Are you really doing this?

10:46.080 --> 10:49.083
- Shannon told us that
she knew you from the past.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.737
She said that you got
a boob job,

10:50.780 --> 10:52.869
or you had something done
by Terry,

10:52.913 --> 10:56.960
and that it was messed up,
and that you sued the Dubrows.

10:57.004 --> 11:00.094
- I felt like just tell her,
just tell her.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.399
She's gonna say,
"It's nothing,"

11:01.443 --> 11:02.879
and then we could all move on.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.402
- We thought--

11:04.446 --> 11:05.490
- You made it a way bigger
thing than it needed to be.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.101
- No, I got
complete confirmation--

11:07.144 --> 11:08.929
- You always do that,
you always do that, Shannon.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.060
- 'Cause you know me
so well, Gina.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.279
I have a good heart.

11:11.322 --> 11:12.802
- I know the bad news about you

11:12.846 --> 11:14.108
'cause I frequent that.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.239
- Hold on one second.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.980
- No, I wanna talk to you,
Heather.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.156
- No, no, over here.
I'll be right back.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.202
- I did not make this a thing.
You made this a thing.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.465
- 12 hours after promising me--

11:23.508 --> 11:25.293
- It's not "The Sisterhood
of the Traveling Pants."

11:25.336 --> 11:27.295
I didn't even
freaking know Heather

11:27.338 --> 11:29.123
when I told you
I wouldn't say anything.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.081
And I didn't know
it pertained to her.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.953
The whole thing is
so ridiculous, Shannon,

11:32.996 --> 11:34.998
and the fact
that you really would try

11:35.042 --> 11:37.261
and put this on me
is so ridiculous.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.742
- Excuse me, this is not
how you speak to your elders.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.222
This isn't how you speak
to anybody.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.746

- No, I'm not.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.840
She's like--don't ever
trust her, that's for sure.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.016
- I'm done, done.
- Why, what happened?

11:53.060 --> 11:55.410
- I'm sorry,
'cause I can't keep my cool.

11:55.453 --> 11:58.239

I'm resentful that I didn't get
to be at home with the kids.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.433
And he's probably resentful
that he was stuck

33:20.476 --> 33:21.869
at home with the kids.

33:21.912 --> 33:23.349
Okay, I think I'm gonna cry.

33:23.392 --> 33:24.872
- It's gonna be okay.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.961
- It's hard to talk about
because I might...

33:27.005 --> 33:28.963
- Yeah, yeah,
don't do that, yeah.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.617
- Weepy thinking about it.

33:30.660 --> 33:31.966
- Yeah we don't want any--

33:32.010 --> 33:33.402
- Okay.
- We don't want any tears.

33:33.446 --> 33:34.838
- How's the weather?

33:34.882 --> 33:37.145

- Please.

34:12.920 --> 34:13.877

the wedge salad.

I'm glad that we went through
what we went through,

35:07.322 --> 35:10.108
even though it was awful and it
was terrible and I cried a lot.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.110
I feel better,
but Shane's not better.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.242
He's not getting any better
and he can't breath

35:14.286 --> 35:17.115
and it scares me.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.594
With the whole quarantine thing

35:18.638 --> 35:21.336
and you getting really sick
and being in the hospital

35:21.380 --> 35:25.558
and you basically telling me
you weren't gonna make it and--

35:25.601 --> 35:29.127
I don't know, I just--
I got to this place emotionally

35:29.170 --> 35:32.173
where I understood why people
have faith

35:32.217 --> 35:33.348
or are religious

35:33.392 --> 35:34.958
'cause I never really
felt that before.

35:35.002 --> 35:39.049
- There's more to life than
what we actually do in life.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.530
- Is that why--
when you were in the hospital,

35:41.574 --> 35:43.271
were you scared to die?

35:43.315 --> 35:44.577
- No.

35:44.620 --> 35:47.580
- You believe wholeheartedly
that when you die

35:47.623 --> 35:49.973
there's some type of afterlife.

35:50.017 --> 35:52.193
But what makes you so sure?

35:52.237 --> 35:53.760
- I know what makes sense

35:53.803 --> 35:57.198
and how I feel when I research
and study and pray about it.

35:57.242 --> 35:58.721
- Honestly, we've been together
for 13 years

35:58.765 --> 36:01.028
and how many conversations
about religion have we had?

36:01.071 --> 36:04.640
- Not as many as we've fought.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.468
So you feel good
about Annabel now?

36:06.512 --> 36:07.687
<i>- I do.</i>

36:07.730 --> 36:10.211
- And how she wants
to live her life?

36:10.255 --> 36:12.431
- I know she's excited
about getting baptized,

36:12.474 --> 36:14.128
and I think a lot of it
has to do

36:14.172 --> 36:16.261
with Shelby and Chanel
both being part of the church.

36:16.304 --> 36:19.264
Those are older sisters.
So she looks up to them.

36:19.307 --> 36:20.395
- Mm-hmm.
- I just--

36:20.439 --> 36:21.657
I want my kids
to have a good life.

36:21.701 --> 36:24.356
I want them to be happy.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.271
I want them to feel fulfilled

36:26.314 --> 36:29.012
and like they have...
- A purpose.

36:29.056 --> 36:31.145
- A purpose and--and
faith in something,

36:31.189 --> 36:32.581
you know, if times are dark.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.627
- Yeah.
- And so I--I just,

36:34.670 --> 36:37.151
I want them to kind of
follow in your footsteps

36:37.195 --> 36:38.631
'cause I can't offer that
to them.

36:38.674 --> 36:42.243
I don't really have any type
of religious background--

36:42.287 --> 36:44.376
- Well, you can be
a good example.

36:44.419 --> 36:45.594
<i>- When I was growing up,</i>

36:45.638 --> 36:47.074
<i>I didn't have
a lot of structure.</i>

36:47.117 --> 36:49.294
I felt very chaotic

36:49.337 --> 36:51.818
and I think that's where
a lot of the anger I have

36:51.861 --> 36:53.428
as an adult
kind of bubbles up.

36:53.472 --> 36:58.303
<i>And so if I can give
my children structure,</i>

36:58.346 --> 36:59.608
peace, and faith,

36:59.652 --> 37:01.349
<i>then I want to do that</i>

37:01.393 --> 37:03.308
<i>so that when they go through
traumatic times,</i>

37:03.351 --> 37:07.312
they have something that
they can look to or turn to.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.313
- I had a nice dinner.

37:08.356 --> 37:11.490
- Thank you, me too.

37:11.533 --> 37:13.492
Did you see the sunset?
It was pretty.

37:13.535 --> 37:16.277
- It was a second prettiest
thing at the restaurant.

37:17.626 --> 37:19.672
- If you could say that
without that, like,

37:19.715 --> 37:21.587
hint of sarcasm,
I would believe it.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.502
But you can't do it,
can you?

37:23.545 --> 37:25.330
- No.

37:25.373 --> 37:26.331
<i>- Coming up...</i>

37:26.374 --> 37:28.289
- Shannon and I had coffee.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.466
She told me that the two of you
were not to be trusted.

37:38.691 --> 37:39.953
- Welcome, ladies.

37:39.996 --> 37:42.172
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.826
Thanks so much.
Appreciate it.

37:43.870 --> 37:46.046
- Thank you.
- Hi.

37:46.089 --> 37:47.787
- You look fancy today.
I went "cas."

37:47.830 --> 37:49.005
- Really?

37:49.049 --> 37:50.180
- Well, you have on
like a kitten heel.

37:50.224 --> 37:52.922
You look beautiful, fancy.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.232
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.842
- So cute here.

37:59.886 --> 38:00.843
- How are we doing, ladies?
- Hi.

38:00.887 --> 38:01.975
- How are you?
- How's it going?

38:02.018 --> 38:04.325
Can you do a skinny,
spicy margarita?

38:04.369 --> 38:05.848
- We sure can.
- I'll do the same thing.

38:05.892 --> 38:07.023
- Yeah.
- So I haven't seen you

38:07.067 --> 38:08.329
since Heather's dinner party.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.592
- I know.
I'm, like, a little nervous

38:10.636 --> 38:13.900
because I didn't think that
was gonna happen like that.

38:13.943 --> 38:16.163
I'm very anxious about
sitting down with Heather

38:16.206 --> 38:18.034
<i>after this party,
of course,</i>

38:18.078 --> 38:20.994
I ----ing
----ed up her party.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.083
I certainly did not think

38:23.126 --> 38:25.868
that this domino effect
was gonna happen.

38:25.912 --> 38:27.609
<i>Heather's extremely
intimidating.</i>

38:27.653 --> 38:31.352
Heather schooled me out like
I was a schoolgirl.

38:31.396 --> 38:32.353
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:32.397 --> 38:33.354
- I'm so--am I late?

38:33.398 --> 38:34.355
- Hi, no, no, no.
- Okay, hi.

38:34.399 --> 38:35.661
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:35.704 --> 38:37.663
- You look beautiful.
- Hi, good.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.142
- Hi. Oh. Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.318
- Nice to see you.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.232
- Good to see you too.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.233
- Hello. Starting you off.
Welcome to--

38:43.277 --> 38:45.061
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.454
- What are you--
what are you guys drinking?

38:46.498 --> 38:48.238
- I got a spicy skinny marg.
- We have a spicy--

38:48.282 --> 38:50.371
- You turned me on to them.
- Okay, I might as well

38:50.415 --> 38:51.981
just go with the band.

38:52.025 --> 38:53.331
I'll do the same.
- I'll be right back.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.637
- Okay, thank you so much.
- No problem.

38:55.681 --> 38:56.856
- Thank you for coming today.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.727
- I know.
- Oh, thank you.

38:58.771 --> 39:00.250
- I still feel terrible.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.601
I just--
and I'm like a jump in person.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.342
I feel awful.

39:04.385 --> 39:05.908
It was a lovely party.

39:05.952 --> 39:08.041
You put in such
a beautiful effort.

39:08.084 --> 39:11.087
And just the fact that
that got messed up,

39:11.131 --> 39:13.742
I feel--I feel
really bad about that.

39:13.786 --> 39:14.917
- She does.
- And in hindsight--

39:14.961 --> 39:16.310
- And--and I do too,

39:16.354 --> 39:18.660
'cause I mean, I told Shannon--
- It got crazy.

39:18.704 --> 39:20.749
- Like, you need to take
accountability for this.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.272
Like, Heather is your friend.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.926
Like, we're just meeting you.

39:23.970 --> 39:26.102
- You were put in
a difficult situation,

39:26.146 --> 39:29.671
but there is a time and a place
to have those conversations

39:29.715 --> 39:31.673
and maybe
that was not great judgment.

39:31.717 --> 39:34.110
- Hindsight, Heather,

39:34.154 --> 39:35.764
totally agree with you,

39:35.808 --> 39:37.157
but I just wanna give you,

39:37.200 --> 39:39.768
like, I guess, like,
little personal background.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.727
My ex-husband had an affair...

39:41.770 --> 39:42.945
- I'm sorry.
- And it was--thank you,

39:42.989 --> 39:44.338
but it's okay, you know,

39:44.382 --> 39:47.776
but the day that I actually
found out about it,

39:47.820 --> 39:51.171
he actually brought me
to her home

39:51.214 --> 39:53.434
because she was having
a barbecue.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.218
They were together--
- I--I just got chills.

39:55.262 --> 39:57.220
- And everybody at the barbecue

39:57.264 --> 39:58.396
knew what was going on
and I'm--

39:58.439 --> 39:59.745
- Except you?

39:59.788 --> 40:00.789
- Yeah, and I'm there
with my husband...

40:00.833 --> 40:02.269
- He brought you there?
- Yeah.

40:02.312 --> 40:06.229
- Smiling, playing, you know,
games, like whatever.

40:06.273 --> 40:10.930
I go home, and I found out.

40:10.973 --> 40:14.760
Being at that woman's home
and everybody knowing,

40:14.803 --> 40:18.764
and nobody told me
was like, so gross.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.374
- Yeah.
- And so I did, honestly,

40:20.418 --> 40:23.986
what I felt would have been
the best thing for you.

40:24.030 --> 40:25.684
- Thank you for sharing that
with me.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.425
I can't even imagine
how difficult that was for you.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.122
- It was really sh---y, yeah.
- But I--

40:29.165 --> 40:31.777
but I can understand how
triggering that must've been.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.344
I feel bad that I maybe
should have reacted differently

40:34.388 --> 40:36.346
and I've had a lot of thoughts
about it since then,

40:36.390 --> 40:40.350
but I...love my family.

40:40.394 --> 40:41.700
- And, you know what, Heather?
- I understand that.

40:41.743 --> 40:44.224
- That why I--I was
totally okay with it

40:44.267 --> 40:46.879
because I knew
this is for you

40:46.922 --> 40:48.881
to have whatever reaction...
- Thank you. I appre--

40:48.924 --> 40:50.839
- You need to have--
- That's very kind of you.

40:50.883 --> 40:51.971
I appreciate that.
- I just wanted you to know

40:52.014 --> 40:53.189
what was going on.
- I appreciate that.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.190
- And I know you believe me.
- I do.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.496
- And I really appreciate that.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.107
<i>When I met Gina,
we connected immediately.</i>

40:58.151 --> 40:59.500
- Yeah, I'm from New York.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.371
I grew up in Westchester.
- Oh!

41:01.415 --> 41:03.025
- Oh, that's where
her parents live.

41:03.069 --> 41:04.026
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.245
- What happened at my party

41:05.288 --> 41:07.377
was confusing
and disappointing.

41:07.421 --> 41:11.251
I'm so glad
that there was an explanation.

41:11.294 --> 41:13.993
I am absolutely ready
to move on.

41:14.036 --> 41:15.516
My real question is this,

41:15.560 --> 41:17.910
what was Shannon's goal?

41:17.953 --> 41:19.172
- Do you think her goal

41:19.215 --> 41:21.217
was to try to make you
and Terry look bad?

41:21.261 --> 41:23.481
- I think that success
breeds contempt.

41:23.524 --> 41:24.917
- Green monster.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.093
- I don't like the J word,

41:27.136 --> 41:29.269
but I can't come up
with anything else.

41:29.312 --> 41:32.228
I didn't run over her cat.

41:32.272 --> 41:34.230
- And she's not telling the
people she should be telling,

41:34.274 --> 41:35.797
and she's involving
other people

41:35.841 --> 41:37.059
that she shouldn't
be involving.

41:37.103 --> 41:38.626
- The other thing that she said

41:38.670 --> 41:41.455
when she came back into my
house to argue with me further,

41:41.499 --> 41:44.371
she said, "Well, I told Gina

41:44.414 --> 41:47.200
"and Emily not to say anything.

41:47.243 --> 41:48.810
I trusted them."

41:48.854 --> 41:50.769
And I said,
"Well, that's a lie too."

41:50.812 --> 41:52.074
'Cause she told me

41:52.118 --> 41:54.250
that the two of you
were not to be trusted...

41:56.035 --> 41:58.037
And...
- Wow.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.342
- And that...
- That is horrible.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.083
- Then you know what?
- Wait, let me finish.

42:01.127 --> 42:04.043
That you were manipulative,
yet she trusted you

42:04.086 --> 42:06.524
with sensitive information
to protect my family--

42:06.567 --> 42:07.525
- Right.
- Right.

42:07.568 --> 42:09.570
- So which isn't?
- Right.

42:09.614 --> 42:11.267
- She wanted me to get
the information

42:11.311 --> 42:12.791
and then I'm the one
that looks like a jerk.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.836
- And we won't do it.
- And I didn't do it.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.882
- She wasn't protecting you,
she's trying to hurt you.

42:16.925 --> 42:19.232
- Yes, and you and you.
- Yeah.

42:19.275 --> 42:20.538
- Same old Shannon.

42:20.581 --> 42:24.977
- Well, a leopard
doesn't change her spots.

42:25.020 --> 42:26.892
<i>- Next time on
"The Real Housewives</i>

42:26.935 --> 42:27.893
<i>of Orange County"...</i>

42:27.936 --> 42:31.113
-
- Whoo!

42:31.157 --> 42:33.246
- That's right my hoohaa.
- Yeah, gets right up there.

42:33.289 --> 42:34.334
- Oh, she's in there.
- Yeah.

42:34.377 --> 42:35.857
- Wow.

42:35.901 --> 42:37.250
- I don't know what Shannon's
goal was with all this,

42:37.293 --> 42:39.295
but it really wasn't cool.

42:39.339 --> 42:41.297
She texted me.
I wrote back.

42:41.341 --> 42:42.472
- Well, this is gonna be good.

42:42.516 --> 42:44.431
- There was some
financial things

42:44.474 --> 42:48.043
that were not disclosed to me
from my husband.

42:48.087 --> 42:50.611
It's just difficult
not having that trust.

42:50.655 --> 42:52.134
- By the way,
you went and ran to Heather,

42:52.178 --> 42:54.397
you told Heather me and Emily
can't be trusted.

42:54.441 --> 42:55.660
- I wanted to believe you

42:55.703 --> 42:57.009
that you were my good friends
that night.

42:57.052 --> 42:58.140
- As people that
you don't trust, but you don't

42:58.184 --> 42:59.141
because you're also talking sh--

42:59.185 --> 43:02.188
about us behind our backs.
