19:29.160 --> 19:31.686
And another boat for anyone,

19:31.760 --> 19:34.411
anyone who wants no more part of this.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.124
'Cause this is how it's gonna be.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.324
Polly?

19:40.880 --> 19:44.202
I'm not staying for
this, Arthur, I'm going home.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.883
Oh, yeah? Home's 57, Watery Lane.

19:48.600 --> 19:53.208
You go there, lock
the doors, you wait for me.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.327
Key to number 57.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.561
I'm going home to the country.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.450
You will stay here until it's over.
Take the fucking key, Linda.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.446
Look, away from here
you are a weakness to all of us.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.171
They will take you hostage and the baby,

20:17.240 --> 20:19.049
they will use the baby.

20:20.120 --> 20:25.047
Take it. Put the kettle on,
wait for your husband.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.727
The only way any of you
Shelbys will leave this place

20:33.840 --> 20:35.922
is on a cloud of smoke likejohn.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.681
Well, you're a Shelby now too, Linda.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.129
Five hundred each.
A thousand for the brace.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.411
Where do you want them?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.562
Charlie, take him to the yard.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.009
TOMMY: Not too far
and not too deep, Curly,

21:25.080 --> 21:26.525
I need the message to get through.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.931
Okay, Tommy.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.846
Finn, you go with him.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.561
Go on. Go with him.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.284
Oh, Tom, uh, telljanet to
save me some goose, please.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.642
On your feet.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.251
Wait outside.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.051
Hello, Mum.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.043
POLLY: They said you'd be out cold.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.808
- No, don't move.
-(SIGHS)

22:42.600 --> 22:44.568
The doctor said they've
sewn you up like a football.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.326
What else did he say?

22:47.960 --> 22:49.450
He said you took four bullets.

22:50.760 --> 22:54.162
Only one was live, one was ricochet...

22:56.880 --> 22:58.245
Two were already spent.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.489
Two had passed throughjohn.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.165
Last thing I remember
was his face.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.370
I watched him go.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.768
Where's Tommy?

23:23.840 --> 23:25.922
Oh, don't worry about Tommy,
just get better.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.490
Where is he?

23:29.400 --> 23:31.528
Tommy's back.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.764
We're all back. Garrison,
Watery Lane, Charlie's...

23:41.120 --> 23:43.282
- I need a cigarette.
- No.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.842
I made a decision.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.604
Give me a cigarette, Mum.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.331
- It's not allowed.
- It's not allowed?

24:04.400 --> 24:07.370
- I've decided we're gonna get away.
- Mm, yeah?

24:08.400 --> 24:11.085
Just me and you, Australia.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.446
I've been to the Cunard office
and I've got a magazine.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.480
- Hmm.
- Now, America's no good

24:18.560 --> 24:21.211
because that's where they are,
but there's no Italians in Australia.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.964
I think there are, Mum.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.251
Bad ones, I mean.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.810
Have you stopped taking
those prison tablets?

24:27.880 --> 24:29.291
Don't you worry about me.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.600
Well, I do.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.929
And just you get better.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.923
The doctor says it'll be five weeks,
then you'll be up and walking.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.968
Now, there's a boat that
leaves on February the 13th.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.883
Tell Tommy I need to see him.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.524
Tell him to bring a gun small enough
to fit in the chamber pot, in case...

24:46.600 --> 24:48.841
I've banned Tommy from coming.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.085
The factory's coming
back to work tomorrow.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.571
Just forget about the fucking factories.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.210
Is there any word of
them going out on strike?

24:56.280 --> 24:57.520
We can go to Australia,

24:58.520 --> 25:00.887
it'll just be you, me, and your sister,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.004
'cause I've found out where she was
buried, somewhere outside Melbourne.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.360
Listen, Mum...

25:09.280 --> 25:11.282
I'm gonna get better slowly.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.209
But you need to get better fast.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.611
Without you he falls apart
and without him...

25:21.600 --> 25:23.443
without him, they'll take us all.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.328
You've got to get us through this.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.765
And I promise...

25:32.600 --> 25:35.285
I'll board that train with
you and we'll go to Australia.

26:10.600 --> 26:14.605
I like your yard, Mr Strong.
How much would you take for it?

26:16.880 --> 26:18.325
It's not for sale.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.006
Not for sale?

26:20.760 --> 26:22.046
<i>Okay-</i>

26:34.120 --> 26:38.170
I just took a look around.
I like this place.

26:39.960 --> 26:43.362
Fire for melting silver,
canal to get it away.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.566
How much?

26:49.480 --> 26:51.608
Nothing you see here
is for sale, Mr Gold.

26:51.720 --> 26:54.291
Oh, everything's for sale, everything.

26:59.800 --> 27:03.441
You tell Mr Strong
I'm going to buy his yard.

27:05.120 --> 27:07.361
This yard has been in
his family since they settled.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.847
But I've decided to
make it part of our deal.

27:16.520 --> 27:17.806
Charfie?

27:20.320 --> 27:21.651
Charlie, come here.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.729
I'm gonna spin a coin
for your yard, Charlie.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.086
You're going to what?

27:31.600 --> 27:32.965
If it's heads...

27:33.760 --> 27:37.003
Abbie here takes all
of this with my blessing.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.686
Tommy?

27:39.920 --> 27:41.410
And if it's tails...

27:44.040 --> 27:45.849
I fuck your daughter, Mr Gold.

27:50.680 --> 27:52.409
You have three daughters I hear,

27:52.960 --> 27:56.567
and Esmeralda is the oldest
and also the prettiest,

27:56.680 --> 27:58.364
so I'll have her.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.330
So make her part of the deal
and spin against the yard.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.883
Tommy, for fuck's sake.

28:04.320 --> 28:07.722
Here, you toss the coin, Mr Gold.

28:21.680 --> 28:22.886
No.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.042
Please don't believe this is a joke,

28:27.160 --> 28:30.050
the coin to us is sacred, yes, Arthur?

28:30.120 --> 28:31.406
Sacred.

28:35.240 --> 28:38.449
You toss that coin, you take
a bet before witnesses,

28:38.840 --> 28:40.205
and if I win...

28:41.240 --> 28:42.651
Then we'll insist

28:43.400 --> 28:49.646
that the terms of this agreement...
wager are fulfilled.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.366
Toss the coin, Mr Gold.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.248
Tommy Shelby, OBE...

29:20.560 --> 29:22.244
No wager today...

29:23.240 --> 29:26.608
but with this penny I will buy
a flower to put on your grave...

29:29.400 --> 29:30.890
When the time comes.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.050
And before that time...

29:36.360 --> 29:41.287
please don't again disrespect
my friends or their valued property.

29:43.600 --> 29:46.206
We missed Christmas, let's have it now.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.161
Peace on earth, goodwill to all men.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.886
Drink?

30:00.360 --> 30:01.930
Ru m, Curly?

30:02.520 --> 30:05.808
Toast to my brother, john,
raise your glasses all of you.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.850
Raise them up, all of you.

30:09.520 --> 30:10.760
John Shelby.

30:11.880 --> 30:15.123
I've got wire, I've got chains,
I've got the steel rods. Now what?

30:15.240 --> 30:17.766
Right, put the steel rods
up the geese's arse there,

30:17.880 --> 30:20.087
and then you put those
steel rods above the fire,

30:20.160 --> 30:22.367
spinning the rod to stop
the bird from burning.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.410
ALL: Cheers!

30:24.800 --> 30:26.131
JOHNNY: You did get potatoes, Charlie?

30:26.200 --> 30:28.407
No, I didn't get fucking potatoes,
what's the matter with you?

30:28.560 --> 30:31.530
I don't want that bastard Aberama Gold

30:31.600 --> 30:33.967
putting it around that we live
like Diddycoys.

30:34.040 --> 30:38.364
I want him to see that we live proper,
that we eat proper, in the proper way.

30:38.440 --> 30:40.488
What the fuck are you talking about?

30:40.560 --> 30:42.483
I'll get the potatoes meself.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.331
Never thought my high
fucking heels from Paris

30:52.400 --> 30:56.246
would be stepping through the horse shit
of Small Heath ever again.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.010
Temporary, Polly.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.401
LIZZIE: Yeah, until hell freezes over.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.764
(CLEARS THROAT) How's Michael?

31:42.320 --> 31:46.086
You said eight men from New York,
seven from Sicily, at £500 each?

31:47.040 --> 31:48.644
Course you can afford it.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.610
Most we'll do ourselves.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.167
How many of your factories
are in the safe territories?

31:54.240 --> 31:55.446
Seventy percent.

31:56.360 --> 31:59.045
Shelby Company Limited
will continue to manufacture.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.801
Lizzie says its only whores these days?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.126
Yeah.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.522
Have them smuggled in, I suppose.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.405
I need you back, Polly.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.568
Paying whores for sex.

32:17.640 --> 32:19.244
Paying killers to kill.

32:19.320 --> 32:20.526
Yep, nothing for nothing.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.971
Poor Thomas.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.890
You know, our mother went this way.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.210
Spirits and ghosts, tablets,
fucking... fucking séances,

32:31.280 --> 32:33.248
scaring us kids
halfway to fuckin' death.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.290
Yeah, well. I'm not going that way.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.447
'Cause in the smoke
I realised something.

32:43.440 --> 32:44.965
I'm just like you now.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.365
You and Arthur.

32:49.640 --> 32:53.531
I was dead in that noose
and then I was saved,

32:53.640 --> 32:55.608
so everything from now on is extra.

32:56.120 --> 32:58.487
But what I didn't understand until today

32:59.400 --> 33:01.323
is when you're dead already...

33:03.600 --> 33:05.011
you're free.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.890
Fucking love it.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.646
I'll help you because
Michael wants me to help you.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.290
Starting now...

33:21.360 --> 33:25.729
Get your whores vetted by Lizzie,
they'll use your weakness.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.569
Don't take any new men on
in the factories

33:27.640 --> 33:29.642
unless you know their families.

33:32.440 --> 33:37.321
And your new friend,
Mr Aberama Gold...

33:38.400 --> 33:41.210
he wants something
other than just money.

33:41.840 --> 33:45.686
I see things in the air around people,
but it's not just the tablets.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.565
It's real.

33:50.640 --> 33:53.007
Ask him what he really wants.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.167
She's a fine beast this one.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.920
Nothing you see is for sale, Mr Shelby.

34:45.560 --> 34:48.166
You know your grandfather
camped with mine for a while?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.159
Yep...

34:50.760 --> 34:51.886
And didn't last.

34:51.960 --> 34:56.123
No, it ended badly
in a pub called the Wenlock.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.766
We were owed money, still are.

35:07.800 --> 35:12.408
Other than money, and this
scrapyard that's clearly not for sale,

35:14.400 --> 35:16.050
what is it that you
want from me, Mr Gold?

35:18.160 --> 35:20.083
How do you know
I want anything from you?

35:21.520 --> 35:25.411
Well, because my company treasurer

35:25.480 --> 35:29.166
is a certified accountant
and also apparently, a witch.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.364
You're a sporting man.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.046
- Yes, I am.
- And a gambling man.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.922
Bonnie, take off your shirt.

35:48.480 --> 35:52.929
What I want from you, Mr Shelby,
is for you to take a gamble on him.

35:53.240 --> 35:56.244
I want you to help
my son achieve his ambition.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.761
(GRUNTING)

36:03.760 --> 36:05.842
What ambition might that be?

36:37.440 --> 36:38.965
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

36:46.520 --> 36:48.284
(KNOCKING)

36:50.560 --> 36:51.641
Who is it?

36:51.960 --> 36:54.042
Inspector Moss.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.491
- I'm looking for Tommy.
- He's at Charlie's.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.885
But I wouldn't go there,
some bad men have arrived.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.726
Yes, I've heard.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.969
They'll be drunk by now, or worse.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.485
Can you take a message?

37:16.560 --> 37:18.767
The, uh, intelligence service in London

37:18.840 --> 37:21.161
have sent seven officers up
to Birmingham

37:21.320 --> 37:24.767
to check out the investigation
into communists and seditionists.

37:24.840 --> 37:28.049
They've got a list of people
of great interest and, uh,

37:28.120 --> 37:31.647
top of that list is
Ada Thorne, formerly Shelby.

37:31.720 --> 37:35.202
Now, they seem to think that
she came back from New York

37:35.280 --> 37:37.851
to organise a revolution in Birmingham.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.490
Well, tell them they're wrong.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.765
Ada Shelby's now firmly back
in place in the family business.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.764
Thing is, when you get
a mark against your name...

37:46.400 --> 37:48.607
it's very hard to shift it.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.925
They will come looking for her.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.641
Well, tell them there's a queue.
Everybody wants a Shelby.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.325
Mrs Shelby...

37:58.480 --> 38:03.202
These are military men,
no less dangerous than any Italians.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.687
You tell Tommy,
I think he'll understand.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.330
Say goodnight to you then.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.926
- Hello, Curly.
- Oh, hello.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.447
I'm here to collect Mr Shelby's
horse. I'm a little early, I think.

38:53.560 --> 38:56.564
Are you going
to train the horse to race?

38:56.680 --> 38:57.761
Yes.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.481
Don't use a crop, she's very gentle.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.049
- I won't.
- CHARLIE: Yo.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.360
I, I...

39:08.040 --> 39:09.883
MAY: How is Mr Shelby?

39:10.360 --> 39:13.842
CURLY: Well, now he's got the Americans
after him, he's a bit hard on people.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.561
- The Americans?
- Yeah, they call them the Mafia.

39:17.880 --> 39:18.961
Dear God.

39:19.080 --> 39:22.209
Yeah, there's 15 of them.
Yeah, they want to kill us all,

39:22.280 --> 39:24.487
but we got guns and grenades
and, and Polly's back,

39:24.560 --> 39:26.483
so it's gonna be okay, yeah.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.765
I'll get the horse.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.081
Mr Shelby, thank God you're back,
we've got real trouble.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.931
TOMMY: What meetings do I have today?

39:54.000 --> 39:57.482
Um, well, uh, there's a supplier
from Coventry at 10:00,

39:57.560 --> 39:59.847
uh, the convener with
the boiler makers unit at 11:00,

39:59.960 --> 40:01.450
and then Chamber of Commerce at 1:00.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.641
But that isn't the thing...

40:02.720 --> 40:05.041
Right. Clear a space here,
move this car back,

40:05.160 --> 40:07.322
give me a hundred feet of rope
and a bell.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.243
- Rope?
- Yep, and a bell.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.848
Mr Shelby, this place
is about to explode.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.604
A rope and a bell, Devlin.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.085
Bonnie, this way.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.526
Yes, Mr Shelby.

40:17.640 --> 40:21.281
And by the way, the revolution
is scheduled to begin at noon.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.171
TOMMY: There he is, Billy Mills,

40:26.240 --> 40:28.242
former heavyweight champion,

40:28.320 --> 40:30.288
Staffordshire, Warwickshire
and Worcestershire.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.447
Hello, Billy.

40:31.760 --> 40:32.647
Yeah.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.521
And now I work for you, Mr Shelby,

40:35.640 --> 40:37.244
for not enough money.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.405
Right. That enough for you?

40:43.240 --> 40:44.446
Enough for what?

40:44.520 --> 40:48.206
Someone here who wants to fight you.
Bonnie Gold, come here, son.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.324
I'm a heavyweight,

40:51.440 --> 40:52.965
he's a welterweight at best.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.969
Nevertheless, he wants to fight you.

40:56.720 --> 41:00.520
Yeah. And then when I damage him,
the Blinders will take my eyes.

41:01.160 --> 41:04.562
No comeback, Billy,
just a fight, Queensbury Rules.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.369
BILLY: When?
TOMMY: Now.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.771
BILLY: Where?
TOMMY: Here!

41:08.840 --> 41:11.446
ARTHUR: Right, you lot, come here.

41:11.520 --> 41:15.081
Let's make it interesting.
Come place a wager with me.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.810
I'll give you good odds.

41:16.880 --> 41:20.521
I'll give you good odds on the boy,
even better on the big lad.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.643
There you go, what you want?

41:25.480 --> 41:27.403
Bonnie, come here, son.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.770
(IN DISTINCT CHATTER)

41:38.960 --> 41:41.611
- Give him one!
- Let's have it then!

42:10.680 --> 42:13.206
Your boy knows he can hit back, right?

42:13.920 --> 42:16.446
Told him in the professional game
people want their money's worth,

42:16.520 --> 42:18.010
don't win too fast.

42:22.280 --> 42:23.770
But if you've seen enough...

42:26.480 --> 42:28.130
Finish it, Bonnie.

42:34.640 --> 42:37.564
Fuck me. That was a punch.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.242
What's he got, horseshoes
in those gloves or what?

42:40.400 --> 42:43.847
No, just his dad's strength
and his mother's temper.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.321
TOMMY: Does he have fits?
ABARAMAH: No.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.090
- Asthma?
- No.

42:53.160 --> 42:54.366
How's he cut?

42:54.440 --> 42:56.647
Well, no one's cut him
yet, but his skin's thick.

42:56.920 --> 42:59.844
- Does he drink?
- Water, sometimes.

42:59.920 --> 43:02.161
- How many fights?
- Twenty-five, bare knuckle,

43:02.240 --> 43:05.562
all knockouts, five with gloves
in pastures, all knockouts.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.563
Against Romany fighters?

43:07.640 --> 43:09.642
That's why they won't let us in the
fairs no more, he keeps winning.

43:09.720 --> 43:12.121
I could fight a fucking tree
and knock it out, Mr Shelby.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.567
(LAUGHS) I like him. 1 like it.

43:14.680 --> 43:18.241
- Mrs Eden is waiting upstairs
- I'll be there in a minute. Arthur?

43:33.920 --> 43:35.410
Mr Shelby's on his way.

43:35.480 --> 43:36.970
Fight in the workshop?

43:37.160 --> 43:39.925
No, no, just a bit of sport.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.001
Do you want some more tea?

43:41.120 --> 43:42.565
No, what kind of sport?

43:44.320 --> 43:46.721
Sport between men, Mrs Eden.

43:48.120 --> 43:49.724
Actually, I'm Miss Eden.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.285
Be patient, a good man will come.

43:55.280 --> 43:58.204
TOMMY: What do you think?
ARTHUR: No, that was over fast.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.009
Yeah, but you can tell, eh?

44:00.080 --> 44:02.560
I'd give him to the Irish boys
at Digbeth, they can teach him.

44:02.720 --> 44:05.405
- And then what?
- We promote him.

44:05.760 --> 44:08.570
Big money in London,
New York, if he's good.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.125
We control him.

44:10.200 --> 44:13.044
On the book, control the odds,
like a horse.

44:13.160 --> 44:17.290
Control when he wins, when he loses.
Alfie Solomon runs a fighter,

44:17.360 --> 44:21.046
says it's fuckin' money for nothing,
fighting's been good for us,

44:21.120 --> 44:22.645
better if you know who's gonna win.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.687
But we got a lot going on, that's all.

44:26.800 --> 44:30.122
Yeah. That's why it'd be good
to have the kid around.

44:31.120 --> 44:32.610
We take the fucking kid on,

44:33.320 --> 44:35.891
one day he may end up
fucking taking a bullet for you.

44:36.360 --> 44:38.408
Can't afford to lose
another brother, can I?

44:40.400 --> 44:43.688
No one else is like him,
so he's all right.

44:44.360 --> 44:45.566
Come on.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.404
All right, I'll do it.

44:51.880 --> 44:54.281
ABARAMAH: But we need to
do a deal about money.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.806
- ARTHUR: Hmm.
- Yeah. Speak to my accountant.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.285
- The witch?
- Yeah.

44:58.360 --> 45:00.840
So when will my first real
fight be do you think, Mr Shelby?

45:00.960 --> 45:04.203
Soon as we can find anyone stupid
enough to get in the ring with you.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.600
God help him.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.125
There you go, Bonnie.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.649
You're a Peaky Blinder now, son.

45:22.720 --> 45:27.521
- There you go, the lion's share.
- Thank you.

45:40.320 --> 45:44.245
Mr Shelby...
I understand you've had a bereavement.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.242
TOMMY: I'm here to talk business.

45:49.440 --> 45:50.851
Then I'll be blunt.

45:51.800 --> 45:52.801
As will I.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.684
What you're doing here is robbery.

45:54.760 --> 45:56.250
Every man is free to leave.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.722
You cut five shillings
from the weekly wage.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.844
And you said, if I did that

46:04.960 --> 46:08.248
you'd bring every man and woman
in all my factories out on strike.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.126
Yes.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.807
Do you have a whistle?

46:16.080 --> 46:18.447
If so, blow it.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.401
I thought at least
we might have a discussion,

46:27.280 --> 46:29.009
as I do with other owners.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.364
I'm not other owners.

46:31.920 --> 46:32.967
No.

46:34.440 --> 46:37.967
You believe because coal is expensive
and it's been a cold winter

46:38.040 --> 46:40.247
and because wages have been
cut over the past twelve months,

46:40.320 --> 46:45.008
you think because of all that
nobody will walk out on strike,

46:46.080 --> 46:47.650
because no one can afford to.

46:49.280 --> 46:51.487
And until recently
that would've been true.

46:52.960 --> 46:55.042
But something has changed
this past year.

46:56.520 --> 47:01.811
Cold winter in the east,
people are not afraid anymore.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.488
I have it on very good authority

47:06.560 --> 47:09.530
that the Bolsheviks couldn't
organise a fucking picnic.

47:12.920 --> 47:14.649
You know, Mr Shelby...

47:16.160 --> 47:18.367
It's almost as if you want trouble.

47:25.560 --> 47:28.040
If the rule of law
in Birmingham were to break down

47:28.120 --> 47:32.682
during this period
of turmoil for my family,

47:32.760 --> 47:36.481
then yes, that would
indeed have its benefits

47:37.320 --> 47:40.290
for reasons you could not understand.

47:40.360 --> 47:41.725
I've heard rumours.

47:42.840 --> 47:44.524
Sport between men.

47:44.840 --> 47:47.491
Just blow your fucking whistle, eh?

47:57.840 --> 48:01.242
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

48:06.400 --> 48:07.925
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

48:10.680 --> 48:12.762
MAN: Tools down, we've had a clearing!

48:14.080 --> 48:16.526
Right, come on you lot,
put your tools down!

48:16.680 --> 48:18.887
(CHATTER)

48:29.320 --> 48:30.890
MAN: Everyone out!

48:33.520 --> 48:35.204
I said, everyone out.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.762
Stop working immediately.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.447
TOMMY: Yeah, come in.

49:03.360 --> 49:04.805
I did say this would happen.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.605
Who's next?

49:08.680 --> 49:14.369
Um, he's a, a delegate from
the European Council for Trade.

49:15.720 --> 49:18.644
He's here to talk about
the import of car parts to France.

49:18.760 --> 49:21.206
- Right.
- He's come all the way from Paris,

49:22.080 --> 49:25.448
but given the circumstances
I could send him away?

49:28.800 --> 49:31.007
Given what circumstances? Send him in.

49:50.640 --> 49:56.283
Mr Shelby, this is
Monsieur Paz from Paris.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.530
I heard you had trouble.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.051
It's good of you to see me.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.089
You just came from Paris, eh?

50:17.800 --> 50:19.290
You know Paris?

50:20.800 --> 50:22.768
I left Paris in a cattle truck.

50:27.360 --> 50:28.964
They said you were French.

50:31.080 --> 50:33.731
Well, I came here from Paris.

50:35.040 --> 50:37.042
That does not mean I'm French.

50:43.280 --> 50:44.850
Guess where I'm from.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.844
Well, in my cattle truck in Paris...

50:55.240 --> 51:00.485
There were American
soldiers who played cards.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.965
They sound like you.

51:08.640 --> 51:11.883
Yeah. Did you win?

51:14.280 --> 51:17.841
You didn't come on a train. Your suit
is pressed, your shoes are clean.

51:18.760 --> 51:21.081
Where do you get your suits made?

51:21.880 --> 51:25.646
I have a tailor in New York City.

51:27.480 --> 51:28.606
Look.

51:32.080 --> 51:35.368
Funacci, Italian.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.050
He's my uncle.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.521
He makes suits in
the basement of Madge Street.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.685
He is my uncle,

51:44.800 --> 51:47.724
so every stitch, stitched with blood.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.961
I heard you dress well, Mr Shelby,

51:56.040 --> 51:57.371
but now I see...

51:58.920 --> 52:00.649
not so well as me.

52:07.720 --> 52:09.643
You know, I have uncles as well...

52:13.480 --> 52:18.202
But they're not the sort of men who
would, who would work in a basement

52:19.000 --> 52:20.650
with a needle and thread,

52:21.800 --> 52:23.040
Mr Changretta.

52:30.720 --> 52:34.691
I am surprised how easy it was
to get into a room with you.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.721
And now?

52:42.080 --> 52:44.162
And now?

52:47.360 --> 52:49.362
And now you should know

52:50.320 --> 52:54.484
that during the trouble you
had earlier on your factory floor

52:54.600 --> 52:58.844
I sent an accomplice
into your office in overalls.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.491
He found your gun...

53:06.080 --> 53:07.525
and unloaded it.

53:15.160 --> 53:16.571
Arthur Shelby.

53:19.120 --> 53:20.007
Polly Gray.

53:23.920 --> 53:25.331
Michael Gray.

53:28.480 --> 53:29.925
John Shelby.

53:37.960 --> 53:39.325
Spent

53:41.120 --> 53:43.043
Ada Thorne.

53:43.520 --> 53:45.443
And finally...

53:51.920 --> 53:53.490
Tommy Shelby.

53:59.120 --> 54:01.009
None of you will survive.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.891
You're level of security is pitiful

54:09.280 --> 54:14.241
and we are an organisation
of a different dimension.

54:17.680 --> 54:20.524
I could've killed you when
I walked through the door.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.285
But you see...

54:25.680 --> 54:27.523
I want you to be the last.

54:30.480 --> 54:34.804
I want you to be alive after
your entire family is dead

54:35.640 --> 54:38.007
'cause my mother says

54:38.880 --> 54:41.360
that is what will hurt you the most.

54:44.720 --> 54:49.408
You people have
traditions of honour, as do we.

54:54.480 --> 54:58.530
Instead of sending you a black hand,
I could've had you killed in the night.

54:59.240 --> 55:01.004
I don't know why...

55:07.640 --> 55:10.120
But I want you to know why

55:12.640 --> 55:19.410
and I wanna suggest to you that
we fight this vendetta with honour.

55:30.480 --> 55:33.484
No civilians, no children.

55:35.440 --> 55:37.044
No police.

55:39.280 --> 55:42.284
Welcome to Birmingham, Mr Changretta.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.765
<i>Grazie.</i>

55:50.680 --> 55:52.921
<i># Where the road is dark</i>

55:54.360 --> 55:58.604
<i># And the seed is sown
Where the gun is cocked... #</i>

55:58.680 --> 56:02.890
Ah, that smell. I miss it.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.570
What, the shithouse?

56:06.040 --> 56:10.090
No. I don't know what it is.

56:11.280 --> 56:14.648
Birmingham, I suppose. Small Heath.

56:16.360 --> 56:19.682
- That smell.
- The smell brings it back.

56:21.160 --> 56:22.730
Where's john do you think, Tom?

56:23.960 --> 56:25.450
Fuck knows.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.481
Well, he's gone, though.

56:28.560 --> 56:30.289
Like a hole behind your head.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.722
Thought you thought
there was are heaven.

56:35.240 --> 56:39.006
No. More like hell for ourjohn.

56:40.440 --> 56:41.930
No, neither one.

56:44.160 --> 56:45.924
He's just not here anymore.

56:49.760 --> 56:51.603
<i># Now I been out in the desert</i>

56:53.800 --> 56:56.201
<i># just doin' my time</i>

56:57.760 --> 57:00.081
<i># Searchin' through the dust</i>

57:01.560 --> 57:03.642
<i># Lookin' for a sign</i>

57:05.000 --> 57:07.128
<i>#If there's a light up ahead... #</i>

57:07.200 --> 57:10.010
It's like with Grace, Arthur...

57:11.040 --> 57:12.451
<i>They're 'gust gone,</i>

57:13.000 --> 57:14.729
just fucking gone.

57:14.840 --> 57:18.401
<i># I got this fever burnin'
in my soul #</i>

57:44.320 --> 57:48.882
<i># On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man #</i>

57:49.000 --> 57:53.085
<i># In a dusty black coat
with a red right hand #</i>
