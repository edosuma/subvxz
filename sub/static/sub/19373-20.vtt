01:18.077 --> 01:21.429
Water would be so cool

Bleh!

01:23.677 --> 01:25.212
Bad news, pups.

01:34.281 --> 01:35.507
It's alright, Marshall.

01:35.609 --> 01:37.960
I can pick up another box

Can you get two boxes?

01:41.148 --> 01:42.538
A whole case, huh?

01:42.641 --> 01:45.507
Okay! But I'll need some
help carrying it.

01:45.616 --> 01:46.890
I'll do it!

01:47.125 --> 01:48.819
Since I ate the
last one.

01:50.915 --> 01:51.921
Sorry, folks!

01:51.969 --> 01:55.140
But I've run out of icey
drinks, and frozen yogurt.

01:58.887 --> 02:00.304
Hi, Mr. Porter!

02:00.405 --> 02:03.241
May we have some flavored Puppy
Pops, please?

02:03.319 --> 02:05.718
Sorry, I've run out
of those, too.

02:05.814 --> 02:07.215
Oh, no!

Ah-hah.

02:10.193 --> 02:12.233

02:17.335 --> 02:21.499
Quick, get me some Meow Meow ice
pops to cool off my kittens.

02:21.577 --> 02:25.038
Oh, Mr. Porter, some frozen corn
for Chickaletta, please.

02:25.086 --> 02:28.319
This heatwave has hit
Adventure Bay so hard.

02:28.442 --> 02:30.202
I'm so sorry, mayors!

02:30.289 --> 02:32.999
But all the ice pops and
frozen corn are gone.

02:33.073 --> 02:36.187
Oh, but what will my poor
overheated chicken do?

02:36.267 --> 02:39.037
It will be okay.
I'm expecting a rush delivery

the animals?

12:48.428 --> 12:50.264
Now, that's a great idea!

12:50.321 --> 12:51.810
Cool!

12:52.321 --> 12:56.591
Hurry! The big race, the Tour De
Turbot, is about to start!

Come on, we don't want to
miss the first hop!

13:00.691 --> 13:02.426
But I'm having so
much fun!

13:02.816 --> 13:05.045
Can I stay and hang out
with Skye, please?

13:05.205 --> 13:07.615
Well, I guess you could stay.

13:07.763 --> 13:11.267
If you don't mind keeping an eye
on you-know-who, Skye.

13:11.380 --> 13:14.149
Skye will keep an eye!
Eeep!

13:14.395 --> 13:16.817
Alrighty.
Don't forget, when I get back,

13:16.918 --> 13:18.279
we'll feed the animals.

13:18.403 --> 13:19.677
Yay!

13:24.494 --> 13:27.626

let's do something else.

Do you want to go
watch the race?

13:29.305 --> 13:33.064
Nah... I know!
Let's surprise Farmer Yumi,

13:33.153 --> 13:34.689
and feed the animals for her!

13:34.840 --> 13:37.689
But we don't know what
they like to eat!

13:37.928 --> 13:39.041
I know!

13:39.099 --> 13:41.611
Let's make them a
ginormous salad!

vegetables right over there.

healthy and strong.

13:53.432 --> 13:57.080
And now, Farmer Yumi's animals
will be healthy and strong, too!

13:57.175 --> 14:00.636
Alex, I don't think Farmer Yumi
wanted you to pick all those...

14:00.706 --> 14:01.800
Oof...

14:01.917 --> 14:03.152
Veggies...

14:08.787 --> 14:11.971
See?
The animals love my salad.

14:12.180 --> 14:15.998
Heh-heh, looks like the floor
loves it, too. Yuck!

14:16.137 --> 14:18.857

animal-robics!

take the trophy.

Merci, I will.
But don't worry, cousin.

14:44.242 --> 14:46.277
