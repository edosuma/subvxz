Gintama finally makes it to the big screen!

00:22.523 --> 00:27.569
It's been 5 long years since the 2005
Jump Festa Anime Tour.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.030
We finally made it!

00:30.114 --> 00:33.867
But the TV series already ended in March...

00:33.951 --> 00:37.037
So it's kind of like a close-out sale.

00:37.079 --> 00:42.209
Hey, don't put a damper on our
big screen debut.

00:42.292 --> 00:46.296
Why are the Warner Brothers making
a samurai anime anyway?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.798
Who are they?

00:47.881 --> 00:53.053
Sunrise must be trying to expand overseas
and approached them saying,

00:53.178 --> 01:00.060
"This anime is a mega-hit in Japan!"
or something like that.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.063
Mr. War and Mr. Ner. Such pushovers...

01:03.147 --> 01:06.859
Mr. War and Mr. Ner?!
What kind of brothers are they?!

01:06.942 --> 01:09.653
Aren't they like the So brothers?

01:09.736 --> 01:12.072
They're not marathon runners!

01:12.114 --> 01:14.366
More like the Yoshida brothers.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.076
They don't play shamisen, either!

01:16.201 --> 01:20.914
I'm out of responses. I'm speechless.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.083
The screen's frozen, too.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.084
That's right.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.795
It's a Gintama specialty - Background only.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.964
Stop making things up!

01:29.089 --> 01:32.259
This is your cinematic debut, right?

01:32.342 --> 01:41.393
If it's a hit, there may be a sequel.
Or a series. An annual release!

01:41.643 --> 01:43.729
You're way too laid back about this!

01:43.812 --> 01:47.816
All right, all right. <i>I'l</i> l get serious.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.109
Okay. Roll it.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.127
The land of the samurai.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.338
There was a time, long ago,

02:09.420 --> 02:10.130
when our country was called by that name.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.089
Wait! Stop!
when our country was called by that name.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.132

From the beginning, of course.

02:18.180 --> 02:23.268
There are aliens called Amanto
who've made a puppet of the Edo Shogunate...

02:23.352 --> 02:27.147
There was the Expulsion War, where we tried
to kick all foreigners out of Edo and...

02:27.189 --> 02:30.567
There were the Loyalists Katsura and Takasugi
who fought in that war, and...

02:30.651 --> 02:33.487
There's Gin, who's actually the White Knight.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.240
I think we get the idea.

02:36.323 --> 02:41.578
Only hard-core fans who already know
the premise will come anyway.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.705
We're very selective.

02:43.789 --> 02:47.709
So skip the niceties. We're wasting time.

02:47.793 --> 02:54.549
I think this background-only is a waste of time.
We haven't even introduced the Odd Jobs Gang.

02:54.633 --> 02:58.637
So introduce the trio and get on with it.

02:58.887 --> 03:04.226
The hero of this story and
the owner of Odd Jobs Gin:

03:04.226 --> 03:08.188
Gintoki Sakata

03:08.188 --> 03:08.313
Gintoki Sakata

03:08.313 --> 03:14.194
The heroine, and the bright flower of Odd Jobs,
whose only drawback is her appetite:

03:14.903 --> 03:15.153
Everyone's idol... the adorable Kagura!

03:15.153 --> 03:18.282
Kagura

03:18.282 --> 03:18.573

Don't worry. I'm no police dog.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.351
You're a dog all right. A rabid, blood-thirsty dog.

05:52.060 --> 05:59.109
I heard there's a serial killer roaming the streets.
You'd better watch whom you bite.

06:00.777 --> 06:06.241
My partner and I have been hungry
for a worthy opponent.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.702

Yeah... The information is good.
It's from the police.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.687
So Takasugi's still in Edo...

06:35.979 --> 06:37.689
TakasugL"

06:37.689 --> 06:40.317
He really whipped us the last time.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.403
Because you took so damn long in the john!

06:43.445 --> 06:45.572
Wait a minute...

06:45.906 --> 06:53.413
Then logically speaking, you work way harder
than me yet you're more useless than I am?

06:53.663 --> 06:55.415
Shut up!

06:57.918 --> 07:00.420
Cut it out, Toshi!

07:02.797 --> 07:08.553
Shinsuke Takasugi's one of the most
dangerous ronin out there.

07:08.929 --> 07:16.353
Rumor has it that he's assembled Nizo Okada,
master swordsman, a.k.a. Nizo the Killer.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.441
Matako Kijima, gunslinger, a.k.a. Crimson Bullet.

07:22.484 --> 07:26.446
Henpeita Takechi, the genius strategist...

07:27.822 --> 07:32.452
and Bansai Kawakami, the mysterious samurai.

07:34.663 --> 07:40.460
Takasugi resurrected the Kiheitai
around these core members...

07:41.294 --> 07:42.712
The Kiheitai?

07:42.796 --> 07:46.591
You mean that troop led by Takasugi
during the Expulsion War?

07:46.716 --> 07:51.471
Yeah... They say they're like a pack of demons.

07:54.099 --> 07:58.395
But what does he plan to do with the Kiheitai?

07:58.520 --> 08:05.068
He assembled his strongest men
to implement a coup d'etat.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.487
Kondou, He's a dangerous man.

08:08.530 --> 08:09.990
I see...

08:09.990 --> 08:14.286
Toshi, gather all the information that you can.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.204
<i>Okay </i>-

08:17.163 --> 08:19.374
And Kondou...

08:19.499 --> 08:21.876
Do you really have to train naked?

08:23.044 --> 08:24.504
More trouble!

08:25.505 --> 08:27.507
Another murder!

08:27.757 --> 08:30.176
What's all the fuss?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.095
They found another body.

08:32.095 --> 08:36.349
Another? How many victims so far?

08:36.558 --> 08:42.522
They say he only kills ronin.
We don't dare go out at night!

08:42.731 --> 08:46.526
I guess that means we're stuck
with our wives for awhile.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.230
Shinpachi, it must be your tea.

09:24.230 --> 09:30.028

You should be able to tell by now.

09:30.028 --> 09:34.366

09:34.366 --> 09:36.576

09:36.576 --> 09:38.119
You can tell by her mouth.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.581
It looks like a coffee bean.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.583

Your coffee.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.341

09:51.633 --> 09:54.219
You're the one who said coffee bean!

Hm? Yes, Odd Jobs.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.618
Shinpachi, it's our last resort. Go get it.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.830
Huh? But Gin will kill us if we use it.

10:22.122 --> 10:26.167
Never mind. He needs to be
weaned off it anyway.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.211

Hey, did he not hear me?

12:42.971 --> 12:50.895
A special sword made by my father
has been stolen! He called it Benizakura!

Really, now?! What in the world
is this Benizakura?!

12:53.606 --> 12:56.192

12:56.192 --> 12:57.777
Did he not hear me again?

12:58.945 --> 13:04.158
The sword was forged by my father,
the greatest swordsmith in Edo!

13:04.242 --> 13:07.745
It was his masterpiece!

13:07.829 --> 13:12.959

had a pale, pink sheen!

after forging Benizakura.

13:38.902 --> 13:43.406
Ever since, terrible things
have befallen those who wield it!

13:43.489 --> 13:47.368

15:22.922 --> 15:27.927
What can you do for Katsura?! Say it! Say it!

15:28.011 --> 15:29.262
That hurt, dammit...

15:31.973 --> 15:35.685
Let go or <i>I'l</i> l turn you into mincemeat.

16:04.964 --> 16:10.428
I was sure it would be pawned.
I guess they're not after money.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.390
Looking for something... Mister?

16:14.849 --> 16:19.353
I'm working. Working.
None of your business. Beat it.

16:20.021 --> 16:23.357
Sorry to bother you, then.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.987
There's a serial killer running around.

16:29.822 --> 16:36.245
None of his victims have survived,
but there has been one eyewitness.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.916
They say the sword he carried...

16:39.916 --> 16:43.377
...it was like a living creature.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.009
Wh-where did you...

16:50.593 --> 16:52.178

17:15.076 --> 17:18.371
Lord Bansai, they're opening now!

17:22.083 --> 17:23.792

17:23.792 --> 17:26.045

17:28.131 --> 17:29.549

17:29.549 --> 17:30.508
Yeah.

17:52.613 --> 17:59.162
Just some country bumpkin.

So, there are still some interesting

It's you... I knew I smelled something familiar.

19:52.733 --> 19:56.445
Nizo the Killer!

19:57.321 --> 20:00.950
Are you the serial killer?

20:00.950 --> 20:03.202
And Gin... what are you doing here?

20:03.244 --> 20:08.207
I guess we both have business with Nizo,
don't we Shinpachi?

20:09.000 --> 20:13.337
I'm touched. You came all this way for me?

20:14.005 --> 20:20.511
I heard this sword invites misfortune,
but it seems to attract warriors.

20:20.511 --> 20:28.686
It led me to Katsura and now you...
It must be a lucky sword for me.

20:28.686 --> 20:31.230
What did you do with Katsura?!

20:31.355 --> 20:37.236
Oh, was he your friend? Sorry to hear that.

20:37.236 --> 20:42.867
I just got my hands on this new sword.
I had to try it out on someone.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.996
Zura would never be killed
by some low-life like you.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.375
I said I was sorry... Oh, yes.

20:52.293 --> 20:56.255
<i>I'l</i> l give you a keepsake.

20:56.547 --> 21:02.762
I took his topknot, but I'm sure
he'd prefer you to have it.

21:02.845 --> 21:09.769
Is Katsura really a man?
His hair is so silky. Just like a girl.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.149
Don't make me say it again.

21:15.149 --> 21:18.527
Zura would never be killed
by some low-life like you.

21:19.820 --> 21:25.826
I'm no match for him, I know.
But it wasn't me that killed him.

21:26.327 --> 21:31.874
It just used my body. Right, Benizakura?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.834
What...?

21:36.337 --> 21:39.048
It's totally dark.

21:39.048 --> 21:43.094
We'd better head back. Gin-chan will be worried.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.428
Maybe not.

21:46.931 --> 21:51.811
Zura will be all right. He's a tough cookie.

21:52.186 --> 21:55.481
We'll call it a day and try again tomorrow...

21:56.357 --> 21:58.317

Hey...

22:14.417 --> 22:16.168
Did you find him?

22:16.168 --> 22:23.592
Nizo must be at it again. He laid low
for a while after that ronin got him.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.886
But he's dangerous.

22:25.970 --> 22:29.098
He was just bragging that he
took down some guy called Katsura...

22:29.181 --> 22:33.602
If anyone finds out about the sword...

22:41.902 --> 22:45.698
Sadaharu, you take this to Gin-chan, okay?

22:47.867 --> 22:53.372

If you had, you and Katsura might still be alive.

25:20.519 --> 25:25.733
The consequence for half-heartedness.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.322
He must be so disappointed.

25:31.947 --> 25:37.328
His comrades all gathered here, but for what?

25:37.703 --> 25:42.541
Weak samurai like you destroyed our nation.

25:54.803 --> 25:58.182
All a samurai needs is a sword.

25:58.182 --> 26:01.685
And yours is broken. You're no longer a samurai.

26:01.685 --> 26:06.565
And you are no longer needed here.
You can just vanish from this nation.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.567

Do you work on this ship?

27:12.923 --> 27:15.467
How about a tour?

27:15.718 --> 27:18.512
Or would you prefer a bullet through the head?

27:18.846 --> 27:20.723
Hey! Are you listening?

27:24.601 --> 27:29.523
The Moon is huge tonight.

27:30.607 --> 27:37.614

but I got a tomboy instead.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.514
Who the hell are you?

28:02.514 --> 28:05.434

28:45.933 --> 28:49.478
Hands off, everyone.

28:49.478 --> 28:55.567
Samurai don't kill women or children.
We capture them alive.

28:55.943 --> 28:59.196
Takechi-senpai! Get over your Lolita fetish!

28:59.196 --> 29:02.241
She's an intruder. Don't let her get away!

29:02.491 --> 29:05.744
Lolita? No, feminist.

29:05.744 --> 29:10.749
Enemy or not, a feminist
is always kind to women...

29:13.794 --> 29:15.754
Who is this little brat?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.339
She's a whippersnapper!

29:19.424 --> 29:22.302
Zura! Where are you?

29:23.095 --> 29:27.266
I know you're here! Answer me!

29:33.647 --> 29:35.941
Now! Hold her down!

29:37.568 --> 29:41.154
Zura! I'm coming for you!

29:41.154 --> 29:43.490
I can't believe it...

29:44.449 --> 29:46.451
She's heading for the factory!

29:57.838 --> 29:59.673
What the...?

30:01.091 --> 30:04.636
Now that you've seen it, I have to kill you.

30:16.148 --> 30:22.821
You use the sword only out of
your fear of others. Put it down.

30:28.118 --> 30:33.999
It is not to kill the enemy,
but to carve away weakness.

30:39.212 --> 30:44.718
It is not to defend yourself,
but to protect your soul.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.872
Gintoki.

31:15.207 --> 31:21.004
Can't you hear him? I can.

31:21.004 --> 31:27.803
Because... I still have a black beast
writhing within me!

31:32.933 --> 31:38.021
I have to persevere until the beast is dead!

32:10.220 --> 32:13.807
You woke up. Thank goodness.

32:14.016 --> 32:17.894
You were so still, I thought you were dead.

32:18.228 --> 32:21.857
Are you conscious now? Do you know who I am?

32:22.983 --> 32:26.570
A girl who's as flat as a board?

32:29.990 --> 32:32.701
What are you doing here?

32:32.701 --> 32:36.246
Shin-chan asked me to take care of you.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.291
Why are you carrying a naginata, then?

32:39.291 --> 32:45.464
Shin-chan asked me to make sure you
got your rest and stop you if you tried to leave.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.467
Stop me? As in kill me?

32:49.384 --> 32:51.970
Where's Shinpachi and Kagura?

32:52.012 --> 32:54.473
They're... out on an errand.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.141
What errand?

32:56.141 --> 33:01.980
Never mind. You need some rest.
Let's read JUMP comics.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.398
You...

33:06.443 --> 33:08.987
I told you not to move.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.198
What if your wound opens up?

33:24.836 --> 33:29.007
Elizabeth... Is that Katsura's...

33:29.216 --> 33:29.925
No+ anoiher
word.

33:34.054 --> 33:37.015
Kagura's not back yet.

33:37.015 --> 33:41.853
Only Sadaharu came back
this morning with this paper...

33:42.312 --> 33:45.816
It got wet in the rain, but it looks like a map.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.151
I haven't told Gin.

33:48.151 --> 33:52.906
If he found out, he would go
despite his condition.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.032
Where are you going?

33:54.032 --> 33:55.033
Ow ow ow ow!
Where are you going?

33:55.033 --> 33:56.576
To take a piss.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.620
You can do it in here.

34:06.086 --> 34:08.130
Can I help you?

34:08.338 --> 34:11.842
Ah, uhm...

34:12.092 --> 34:14.594
Ah.. If you need Gin, he's...

34:14.594 --> 34:18.431
I'm right here. Come in.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.059
I was expecting you.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.815
You really took a beating.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.734
First, you take Benizakura without asking.

34:29.734 --> 34:34.072
Then you dare to show up
with your tail between your legs?

34:34.281 --> 34:39.034
I hope you're ready to take responsibility
and slit your belly, Okada.

34:39.244 --> 34:45.417
I brought it back, despite my arm.
Give me some credit.

34:45.667 --> 34:49.420
It was a good experience for Benizakura.

34:49.713 --> 34:53.632
Your egotism is getting out of hand.

34:54.092 --> 34:59.598
You always seem to find a way
to irritate Lord Shinsuke.

34:59.890 --> 35:05.312
Think you're tough? Don't make me laugh.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.231
The only reason you beat Katsura is because...

35:12.152 --> 35:15.947
Don't take this personally...

35:16.156 --> 35:24.873
It's encroaching on my body,
like it owns me or something.

35:25.248 --> 35:29.044
You'd better watch what you say to me.

35:29.044 --> 35:29.836
<i>044 Jobs CW-CHA</i> N

35:29.836 --> 35:32.422
Odd Jot; GIN-Ci-MN
You came to tell me the truth, right?

35:32.422 --> 35:34.257
You came to tell me the truth, right?

35:34.257 --> 35:37.719
You can't fool me with talk about
some cursed sword...

35:37.719 --> 35:39.262
What is that thing?

35:39.262 --> 35:42.015
Who created that monster?

35:44.226 --> 35:46.144
Okada... you...

35:46.811 --> 35:49.397
They're a nuisance.

35:49.397 --> 35:58.281
We're here to wreak havoc in this wasteland...
To become a legend.

35:58.615 --> 36:02.160
But they're always glimmering behind me.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.414
So irritating.

36:06.414 --> 36:13.588
It's time for old legends to wither
and make way for the new!

36:16.883 --> 36:20.887
They're not his comrades anymore.

36:20.971 --> 36:22.389
We are.

36:24.349 --> 36:32.732
Benizakura is a mechanical anti-warship
mobile weapon modeled after my father's sword.

36:33.358 --> 36:39.406
Using artificial intelligence it lives
in its host, eventually taking it over.

36:39.948 --> 36:45.203
It compiles actual combat data and
continually upgrades its capabilities.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.206
A living katana.

36:52.210 --> 36:56.172
There's only one person in Edo
who could create such a thing...

36:57.257 --> 37:00.468
Please... stop my brother.

37:01.928 --> 37:08.476
They... Takasugi... will use it to burn
Edo down to the ground.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.402
How capricious.

37:17.402 --> 37:22.115
Creating such a weapon
in an age of cannons and guns.

37:22.282 --> 37:28.079
And scheming to overthrow
the Shogunate at that!

37:28.496 --> 37:32.834
Talk is cheap. A hero always delivers.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.794
I never talk unless I can deliver.

37:35.920 --> 37:41.092
Let's show them that samurai and swords
are still alive and kicking.

37:41.509 --> 37:46.264
I don't care about your aspirations.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.267
I'm a swordsmith!

37:49.267 --> 37:51.895
The only thing I know is...

37:53.104 --> 37:55.357
This sword is invincible!

37:56.399 --> 38:01.279
So at the end of the day,
your brother just used me.

38:01.404 --> 38:07.118
He asked me to find the sword,
so it could taste my blood.

38:07.452 --> 38:14.042
Or did Nizo put him up to it? Or both?

38:15.001 --> 38:18.421
And now you want me to help your brother?

38:18.421 --> 38:20.840
Your skin must be as thick as a volume of JUMP.

38:21.257 --> 38:23.635
I have no excuse.

38:23.635 --> 38:28.181
But if the truth comes out, he'll be destroyed.

38:28.348 --> 38:34.646
You must really love him. He's an accomplice
to murder yet you look the other way?

38:34.646 --> 38:35.397
Gin!

38:36.940 --> 38:39.317
My beloved father used to say...

38:40.360 --> 38:43.321
A sword is but a blade that kills.

38:43.488 --> 38:47.575
I can invest my soul into it,
but I can't choose its master.

38:49.369 --> 38:52.831
These words have become a part of us.

38:52.831 --> 38:56.334
My brother is just a fool who knows nothing else.

38:58.378 --> 39:02.340
Always forging steel, trying to surpass our father.

39:02.632 --> 39:07.220
He even sought financiers to start
researching mechanical weapons.

39:08.096 --> 39:11.349
That's when he got involved
with some dodgy people.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.060
But I didn't stop him...

39:14.144 --> 39:23.653
We just focused on sword making.
I told myself, that was our job.

39:25.071 --> 39:30.785
But I knew. It was a weapon...
A tool to kill people.

39:32.412 --> 39:36.374
But... I can't bear it.

39:37.000 --> 39:44.716
I can't bear to see my brother's masterwork
being used in such a destructive way...

39:45.425 --> 39:49.637
But it's come to the point where
I can't stop it on my own.

39:50.430 --> 39:55.393
I don't know what to do... What should I do?

39:56.227 --> 39:59.522
I'm the one who doesn't know what to do...

39:59.731 --> 40:01.524
I'm injured...

40:02.025 --> 40:03.359
My comrade's been killed...

40:03.359 --> 40:05.111
My mind is spinning.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.990
Here... I don't want your money.

40:09.449 --> 40:14.496
Go home. I'm through with this.

40:19.125 --> 40:22.170
Gin is out of commission. It's up to me, now.

40:22.795 --> 40:25.423
I know Kagura-chan is on that boat.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.759
But how do I sneak on?

40:27.842 --> 40:31.429
There are ronin everywhere
and they don't look too friendly.

40:31.804 --> 40:32.847
What do I do?

40:35.475 --> 40:37.435
Oh my god, what is that?!

40:39.354 --> 40:44.025
Ow... That damned Nizo.
Who does he think he is?

40:46.486 --> 40:47.654
Let me go!

40:47.779 --> 40:51.574
You think you're going to get away with this?!

40:52.325 --> 40:53.451
Calm down!

40:53.451 --> 40:55.453
Gin-chan is going to mess you up!

40:55.453 --> 40:56.037
Hey, cut it out!

40:58.289 --> 40:59.749
They're already messed up.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.336
She's just a kid!

41:03.336 --> 41:05.463
We shoulda gotten rid of her a long time ago.

41:05.630 --> 41:10.301
But we don't have any information yet.

41:10.301 --> 41:16.015
And these girls really do blossom
in another two, three years...

41:16.015 --> 41:18.810
Get a hold of yourself, lolicon!

41:18.810 --> 41:21.020
I'm not a Iolicon.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.480
I'm a feminist.

41:22.689 --> 41:27.193
Look, her wounds have all but healed overnight.

41:27.402 --> 41:31.864
And her superhuman strength.
Her translucent skin...

41:32.073 --> 41:34.284
I've heard enough.

41:34.284 --> 41:37.495
I'm telling you, I'm a feminist!

41:37.745 --> 41:39.497
I just love children.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.583
Exactly, you lolicon!

41:41.833 --> 41:46.504
You'll never understand, you idiot.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.505
Who's an idiot?

41:47.505 --> 41:50.800
That's what I'm saying.

41:50.800 --> 41:54.512
Her characteristics match
those of the Yato Clan. So, die.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.221
You die.

41:56.472 --> 41:59.517
Yato Clan? You mean those mercenaries?

41:59.559 --> 42:03.062
Those hired assassins
that attacked Lord Shinsuke?

42:03.646 --> 42:05.607
Who's behind it?

42:05.607 --> 42:08.610
All she'll say is Zura.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.529
She's toying with you.

42:11.529 --> 42:15.533
You Iolicon feminist, whatever. You gross me out.

42:15.617 --> 42:19.454
Watch how it's done. All it takes is...

42:19.454 --> 42:20.121
Hey...

42:23.166 --> 42:27.170
Do you realize what you've done? <i>I'l</i> l kill you!

42:27.170 --> 42:30.423
No, wait! In two or three years, she'll blossom...

42:30.423 --> 42:32.258
Let go of me, you freak!

42:32.383 --> 42:34.260
I'm your superior, not a freak!

42:34.594 --> 42:36.054
Who are you?

42:36.054 --> 42:37.221
He looks sketchy.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.557
I've never seen anyone so sketchy.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.101
He's the picture of sketchiness.

42:42.101 --> 42:42.518
Listen... I don't know who you think you are...
but you'd better turn around!

42:42.518 --> 42:47.398
What is she doing? Watch out! Listen... I don't know
who you think you are... but you'd better turn around!

42:47.732 --> 42:48.691
Excuse me. I need
some direcfions.

42:49.651 --> 42:51.903
To the gates of HELL!

42:56.157 --> 42:58.576
God of Phlegm, give me power.

42:59.702 --> 43:01.579
That's disgusting. Stop that!

43:02.830 --> 43:04.582
EAT THIS!

43:08.961 --> 43:09.587
What?

43:09.587 --> 43:10.713
What the hell?

43:14.676 --> 43:16.511
What are you doing?

43:18.638 --> 43:20.473
Intruder! Intruder!

43:20.473 --> 43:21.599
Elizabeth!

43:23.768 --> 43:25.812
GO!

43:30.525 --> 43:33.069
Thanks, Elizabeth!

43:36.656 --> 43:38.241
I'm relieved.

43:39.659 --> 43:42.620
I thought you'd go, even in your condition.

43:44.747 --> 43:47.709
But then, you'd die.

43:47.709 --> 43:49.210
I guess.

43:49.210 --> 43:52.630
I feel bad for that girl, but it can't be helped.

43:54.090 --> 43:55.258
I guess...

43:56.217 --> 43:57.343
Gin?

43:58.678 --> 44:02.306
Don't do anything unnecessary.
Take better care of yourself.

44:03.391 --> 44:07.645
Shin-chan and Kagura-chan
would be lost without you.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.398
I guess...

44:12.066 --> 44:17.447
You were pretty wild in your day,
but you're getting older now.

44:17.447 --> 44:19.073
Let it go already!

44:19.073 --> 44:21.743
I said I'm not going anywhere,
so go buy me the latest issue of JUMP!

44:21.868 --> 44:26.664
You got the wrong one the last time.
You're just like my mom, dammit!

44:27.290 --> 44:29.625
Okay, okay. Sorry.

44:39.343 --> 44:40.678
Sorry.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.681
Watch it!

44:47.143 --> 44:49.771
<i>Sorry. Wah' for me on' your house.
Odd Job</i> s

44:51.189 --> 44:55.818
I know I'm getting too old for this.

45:00.948 --> 45:03.910
MY Favorite umbrella.
Make sure you bring it back.

45:16.005 --> 45:20.176
She's such a pain.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.723
He's such an idiot.

45:33.147 --> 45:34.732
What's all that noise?

45:35.274 --> 45:38.319
The Shinsengumi? Are the police dogs onto us?

45:38.319 --> 45:39.695
No!

45:39.695 --> 45:40.905
What is that?

45:43.741 --> 45:45.743
Takasugi!

45:45.743 --> 45:49.956
You share our mission to protect
our land from foreigners

45:49.956 --> 45:53.751
yet you killed our leader, Kotaro Katsura!

45:53.751 --> 45:55.294
It's unforgivablel

45:55.670 --> 45:57.922
We're no longer comrades!

45:57.922 --> 46:00.758
You've crossed the line!

46:00.758 --> 46:04.053
Suffer the wrath of God!

46:04.053 --> 46:05.054
FIRE!

46:07.932 --> 46:10.309
<i>What'? Ka'tsura's comrades'</i> ?

46:10.309 --> 46:11.769
We'll set out immediately!

46:12.061 --> 46:14.188
Payback time for Katsura?

46:14.814 --> 46:17.525
It's all Nizo's fault, that dog.

46:17.817 --> 46:23.698
Payback or not, I think the truth
about Benizakura is out.

46:24.031 --> 46:29.620
I've heard that Katsura's clan
has become more moderate lately.

46:29.620 --> 46:34.000
They want to destroy Benizakura
and quash our uprising.

46:34.834 --> 46:42.800
Perhaps so... Or maybe this girl is one of them
and this attack is merely a diversion.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.804
Listen up!

46:47.221 --> 46:48.931
We know what you're after!

46:49.140 --> 46:50.516
It's this girl.

46:50.516 --> 46:56.939
I understand you want to save her,
but if you keep shooting, she might get...

47:01.944 --> 47:04.822
Takechi! Do you call that moderate?!

47:04.822 --> 47:08.993
How unexpected. Well, at least they missed.

47:09.035 --> 47:11.329
It's your brain that's missing!

47:13.039 --> 47:17.501
Are you stupid? I have nothing to do with them!

47:17.501 --> 47:18.961
Ooh hoo hoo! How embarrassing!

47:18.961 --> 47:21.797
Do you realize what a
precarious situation you're in?

47:22.798 --> 47:23.549
Not again!

47:23.883 --> 47:26.427
So irresponsible!

47:32.850 --> 47:34.810
Useless, as usual.

47:38.606 --> 47:40.149
I'm here, Kagura-chan!

47:40.524 --> 47:42.485
Shinpachi!

47:47.907 --> 47:49.158
Hey.

47:53.204 --> 47:55.748
Sorry to walk in on you.

47:55.748 --> 47:57.375
Your customers are here.

47:59.460 --> 48:02.254
You really had a field day.

48:02.630 --> 48:07.843
Now I have to deal with these fools
before we overthrow the Shogunate.

48:10.471 --> 48:13.057
So you killed Katsura.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.893
And you fought Gintoki.

48:15.893 --> 48:18.813
You even used Tetsuya.

48:21.607 --> 48:25.611
And what do you have to show for it?

48:25.611 --> 48:31.909
Tetsuya must be ecstatic.
All he cares about is his creation.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.246
What about you?

48:40.292 --> 48:46.549
Are you sad that your old comrade is dead? Or...

48:52.179 --> 48:53.180
Well, now...

48:53.764 --> 48:56.726
You've grown back a nice arm.

48:56.726 --> 49:02.273
You two must be compatible.
In like skin as they say.

49:03.691 --> 49:05.776
Go finish them off.

49:05.776 --> 49:09.947
Destroy them all and <i>I'l</i> l forgive the rest.

49:10.239 --> 49:13.784
It would have ended like this anyway.

49:14.201 --> 49:15.953
And...

49:17.455 --> 49:21.417
Don't ever call us comrades again.

49:21.417 --> 49:24.754
Our bond is much stronger than that,
them and me.

49:25.421 --> 49:28.758
The next time you say it, <i>I'l</i> l cut that thing off.

49:32.428 --> 49:35.264
You really meant to kill me.

49:44.148 --> 49:48.152
Who are you? Answer me!

49:48.152 --> 49:53.657
Matako! I think you should focus on running.
Or else you'll end up like...

49:54.575 --> 49:59.330
I can't carry you anymore!
I know I came to save you, but help!

49:59.330 --> 50:00.998
You can do it, Shinpachi!

50:00.998 --> 50:03.000
How can you be so carefree?

50:03.084 --> 50:08.380
Shinpachi, I came here looking for Zura,
but I couldn't find him.

50:08.380 --> 50:12.176
What happened to him?
What about Gin-chan? Where is he?

50:13.344 --> 50:14.178
Shinpachi.

50:17.765 --> 50:19.100
Shinpachi!

50:19.600 --> 50:21.310
<i>Kagura-Chan'.</i>!

50:44.667 --> 50:45.960
What is that?

50:46.043 --> 50:48.879
Shoot it!... Shoot it down!

51:06.147 --> 51:07.690
Hey...

51:10.109 --> 51:13.988
Happy to bring down such small fry?

51:15.156 --> 51:18.159
<i>I'l</i> l bring you all down!

51:31.088 --> 51:34.425
If you're bent on destruction, why not join us?

51:44.101 --> 51:46.020
With a single sword?

51:58.157 --> 51:59.116
Shinpachi!

52:06.707 --> 52:09.877
Elizabeth! You came all this way!

52:10.336 --> 52:12.087
H's a long
sforg.

52:23.182 --> 52:24.767
ELIZABETH!

52:25.017 --> 52:32.524
When did this become a costume party?
This is no place for kiddies.

52:32.524 --> 52:33.984
I'm no kid...

52:39.490 --> 52:40.950
<i>'m Katsura.</i>!

52:49.416 --> 52:51.627
Go, Benizakura!

53:01.220 --> 53:04.848
<i>I'l</i> l bring you all down, with this!

53:08.978 --> 53:11.897
Why? At a time like this...?

53:13.440 --> 53:19.113
Hey, it's already started.
It'll be over before we get there.

53:19.238 --> 53:24.201
One blow from Benizakura
is equivalent to ten battleships.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.078
They won't be able to stop it.

53:26.245 --> 53:31.166
That's too big to fathom.
Give me a more relevant example.

53:31.166 --> 53:34.461
A mom with boobs with
the power of 1,000 missiles.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.297
That's no ordinary mom!

53:37.339 --> 53:38.090
Use this...

53:38.090 --> 53:40.718
Huh? What's this?

53:41.969 --> 53:46.807
I made it. You can't use a wooden sword
against Benizakura.

53:47.016 --> 53:50.519
Thanks, but what's this ornament
on the handle? Dog poo-

53:53.314 --> 53:55.316
What the hell are you doing?

53:55.316 --> 53:57.776
It's not what you think. It's a coiled dragon!

53:57.776 --> 54:01.405
You said "it's not what you think"
before I even said anything!

54:01.405 --> 54:04.325
That's proof that you know
that it looks like dog poop!

54:07.286 --> 54:08.245
Elizabeth!

54:08.662 --> 54:10.247
The ship is ready!

54:10.247 --> 54:12.333
Are we really going?

54:12.333 --> 54:17.338
Two ships have already gone down!
And we don't even have heavy weapons.

54:17.338 --> 54:20.632
What kind of crazy weapons do they have?

54:20.966 --> 54:23.093
We have 

54:23.218 --> 54:25.763
Face Katsura? But he's already...

54:26.430 --> 54:27.848
I feel something s-lrangelg
familiar on -lha-I ship.

54:28.057 --> 54:29.683
Elizabeth, could it be?

54:29.683 --> 54:31.727
No, it can't be!

54:31.727 --> 54:34.063
Let's get on the boat!

54:34.063 --> 54:36.273
Elizabeth has a sixth sense.

54:36.273 --> 54:37.691
Just the other day at the track...

54:40.652 --> 54:43.530
Lord Shinsuke! Lord Shinsuke.

54:45.449 --> 54:49.703
Fancy meeting you here.

54:53.332 --> 54:56.001
No... Katsura!

54:56.335 --> 55:00.297
I couldn't leave this world just yet.
So I came back.

55:00.756 --> 55:05.219
I couldn't die, especially
at the hand of an old comrade.

55:05.636 --> 55:08.389
Don't you agree, Takasugi?

55:10.349 --> 55:12.393
Comrade, huh...

55:13.560 --> 55:18.482
I didn't know you still felt that way...
Thanks, but no thanks.

55:18.816 --> 55:21.568
So you still kept it?

55:22.319 --> 55:23.904
We're both old fools.

55:24.154 --> 55:31.328
Heh. So, it protected you from Benizakura too?
I guess memories are good for something.

55:31.328 --> 55:34.331
No, I owe it to that useless Nizo.

55:34.331 --> 55:40.045
He got so excited,
he didn't even bother to check.

55:40.379 --> 55:42.256
All he cut was my topknot.

55:42.381 --> 55:46.343
I guess you've gotten good at playing dead.

55:46.510 --> 55:52.141
So did you come back for revenge?
You think I was behind it?

55:52.724 --> 55:57.146
I don't care if you told him to do it or not.

55:57.396 --> 56:02.526
But I can't let you get away
with what you're planning to do.

56:04.403 --> 56:07.906
Your ambitions are going down with this ship.

56:12.661 --> 56:14.371
What's happening?

56:15.038 --> 56:16.373
Kats u ra !

56:16.373 --> 56:19.251
Don't think you'll get out of here alive!

56:20.335 --> 56:24.339
Not until I see the dawn of Edo
with my own eyes.

56:24.339 --> 56:28.886
Edo would not be pleased to be roused
from her sleep by the likes of you!

56:29.970 --> 56:32.389
Go to sleep, forever!

56:32.389 --> 56:34.391
You go to sleep!

56:35.976 --> 56:38.812
You worried us sick!

56:38.812 --> 56:41.148
You were in Elizabeth all this time!

56:41.440 --> 56:44.776
Give me a break!

56:46.361 --> 56:51.408
How long have you been in her?
How long have you duped us?

56:51.533 --> 56:57.414
Can't we deal with this later?
Look! They're poised to attack!

56:57.414 --> 57:00.626
Shut up! I'm poised to attack, too!

57:00.792 --> 57:04.838
Calm down. I'm sorry I didn't explain.

57:05.589 --> 57:10.511
I thought it was just me they were after.

57:11.011 --> 57:17.976
I thought it would be easier to spy on them
if everyone thought I was dead.

57:20.270 --> 57:24.441
I didn't mean to drag you all
into my personal problems.

57:24.650 --> 57:28.445
But why Elizabeth?

57:28.904 --> 57:31.073
We can't even get close...

57:31.073 --> 57:32.574
What are you doing?

57:33.158 --> 57:34.451
What...?

57:35.494 --> 57:38.080
It's coming this way...

57:43.710 --> 57:46.463
The ship barged its way in!

57:47.965 --> 57:48.674
Rrraargh!

57:49.758 --> 57:53.470
Takasugi! You won't have your way!

57:53.470 --> 57:56.139
I'll kill all of them!

58:00.852 --> 58:03.105
Elizabeth...? Everyone...

58:03.105 --> 58:03.146
I/I/e cou/dn 'f _/'us-f sif
fhe/-9.' Elizabeth...? Everyone...

58:03.146 --> 58:03.522
<i>We oouldn'f jusf sh' fhere</i>!

58:03.522 --> 58:05.148
<i>I/I/e cou/dn 'f _/'us-f sif
fhe/-9.' Forgive us, Katsura</i>!

58:05.148 --> 58:08.819
I/I/e cou/dn 'f _/'us-f sif fhe/-9.' You
told us not to mobilize no matter what!

58:09.528 --> 58:13.490
But we heard you were in trouble. We couldn't
just sit there! We couldn't help ourselves!

58:13.490 --> 58:18.370
How can I get mad at you? Look at your faces.

58:18.912 --> 58:19.538
<i>C'mon!
Bring if</i>!

58:19.538 --> 58:20.038
C"/non.' <i>Brin</i> g if.' I'm the one who owes
you an apology. I left you in the dark.

58:20.038 --> 58:23.917
I'm the one who owes you an apology.
I left you in the dark.

58:24.459 --> 58:28.714
You wanted to save your old comrade Takasugi

58:28.797 --> 58:32.467
so you kept it quiet and
tried to convince him yourself.

58:32.467 --> 58:33.635
But unwittingly.

58:33.635 --> 58:38.974
We created such an uproar that the rift between
you and Takasugi's clan is now irreparable.

58:38.974 --> 58:40.642
Enough!

58:40.642 --> 58:43.270
It would have come to this anyway.

58:44.021 --> 58:45.689
We have if covered. You can go.

58:46.398 --> 58:47.733
There's
still iime.

58:47.858 --> 58:49.443
Elizabeth...

58:49.860 --> 58:50.902
<i>Be sure you come back ibis fime</i>.

58:53.572 --> 58:54.114
Thanks.

58:55.365 --> 58:56.450
No way!

58:56.783 --> 58:58.327
Move it!

59:05.083 --> 59:05.917
You guys?

59:05.917 --> 59:08.629
We came this far. We're with you all the way.

59:08.629 --> 59:11.465
Damn you, Zura! You owe us dinner!

59:12.132 --> 59:13.133
You

59:17.220 --> 59:19.556
I won't let you get near Lord Shinsuke.

59:19.556 --> 59:25.562
I'm a feminist, but you're testing my limits.

59:25.562 --> 59:29.691
You've ruined all our plans.
That gets me really angry, dammit!

59:29.941 --> 59:30.776
Tch.

59:33.195 --> 59:39.576
One year's worth of pickled seaweed
and the DVD set of my choice.

59:39.576 --> 59:41.578
And food for Sadaharu.

59:41.578 --> 59:44.581
Tsuu-Chan's new album
and glossy photo collection.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.958
And 100 Baagen Dash ice cream cups.

59:46.958 --> 59:48.210
No, make that 1,000.

59:48.293 --> 59:51.254
No fair! Ten years worth of pickled seaweed!

59:51.254 --> 59:52.547
What the heck?

59:52.547 --> 59:53.965
Go, you idiot!

59:53.965 --> 59:58.011
If anything happened to you,
I could never face Gintoki!

59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.055
Are you kidding?

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:03.058
Just show him your ridiculous haircut
and give him a laugh!

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:09.606
I don't understand... Who are you?

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:16.613
You're not ronin or Katsura's subordinates.
You're certainly not on our side.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:21.118
Who the hell are you? What do you want?

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:23.036
Who do you answer to?

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:36.633
The stupidest samurai in the universe!

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:40.887
This light...

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:17.466
I knew some fools had barged in
while I was hard at work.

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:19.968
But I didn't expect you, too!

01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:24.681
Did you come to loot the place?

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.058
What can you do in your condition?

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:31.354
Are you too far gone
to realize what you're doing?

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:35.150
You don't look so good either.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:38.612
You look pale. Have a stomachache? Hmm?

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:41.156
You're the one with a stomachache!

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:51.291
What's wrong? Bleeding?

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:56.254
What's wrong? You're bleeding.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:13.730
Look Zura, Gintoki is here.

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:17.734
He's going to take on Benizakura.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:23.240
Ridiculous as usual. It's like taking on
a warship with your bare hands.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.953
It's not human.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:34.167
His body can't keep up with Benizakura.

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:39.047
He's going to die... You knew that, didn't you?

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:45.178
You knew what Benizakura would do to him.
Wasn't he your friend? Don't you care?

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:48.890
He made his own choice.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.393
I'm sure he's happy to die.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:52.769
Happy?

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.187
That's right!

01:02:54.187 --> 01:03:01.611
He wanted to become one with the sword
to protect the flame called Takasugi!

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:04.573
He'd rather go up in flames than be
plunged into darkness again!

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:07.576
He has no qualms about it growing within him!

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:11.329
He's blinded by the light and can see little else!

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.749
What a pitiful fool!

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:19.421
But there's beauty there beyond good or bad!

01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:23.091
Like the singular arc of a sword, there is beauty!

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:29.639
A sword kills. A swordsmith forges.
What does a samurai do?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:38.648
In any case, devotion to a singular purpose
is both beautiful and powerful. Like this.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:43.528
They're simple guys, but I love them.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:52.537
There's only a single path in front of me, too.
I don't care who dies along the way.

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:58.126
Where's the beauty? Is that what you wanted?

01:03:58.335 --> 01:03:59.836
Stop it.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:03.214
I can't stand to see your katana
cause more bloodshed!

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.509
Then why did you bring that man here?

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.721
You brought him here to die, didn't you?

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:17.354
Do you think that dull sword of yours
stands a chance against my Benizakura?

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:18.271
What?!

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:21.149
Impossible!

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:26.404
Is he a match for Benizakura?

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:29.950
Could he be... surpassing it?

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.243
Impossible!

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:36.373
I know Benizakura is wasting Nizo away,

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:41.628
but the sword itself should be
growing stronger with all the data.

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.254
It can't be...

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:53.139
That man... Could he be evolving
faster than Benizakura?

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:55.350
Or...!

01:04:56.351 --> 01:05:04.359
Did the life or death confrontation awaken
memories of battle that lay dormant inside him?

01:05:08.697 --> 01:05:11.199
Is this the power of the White Knight?

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.536
It won't go out.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:20.917
No matter what I do.
The damned light won't go out.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:38.518
Hmm.. I see you've mastered the art of kenjutsu
but this is your first true swordfight, isn't it?

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.437
You're shaking.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:45.942
This is a phantom sword
that's intoxicatingly strong...

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.653
I wouldn't push it if I were you.

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:51.948
By the way, my sword is named Shimura,
like the comedian.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:54.951
You know how he shakes in his skits?

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.244
You know that joke too?!

01:05:56.453 --> 01:06:03.293
I'm more of the intellectual type. I leave these
physical matters to this female boar here.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:07.839
Who's a boar?! Shall I blast one
into that sorry ass of yours?

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:13.053
Guts and glory in battle! Kill or be killed!

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:19.434
Gotcha!

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:34.324
You couldn't beat me
in a hundred years, little girl!

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:43.625
Gin!

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:45.001
Gin-chan!

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:54.969
What is this?

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.554
Nizo?

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:10.860
I told you, I'm not the physical type.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.029
Senpaﬂ

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.824
Nizo! Have you gone mad?

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:23.039
Has Benizakura taken over?
I had a bad feeling about this.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.833
Stop, Nizo!

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:35.051
It's completely taken over!

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:39.556
Nizo has lost himself to it.
He's become the sword itself!

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:43.351
Even the White Knight
won't be able to stop him now!

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:48.064
This is the true power of
Benizakura - the ultimate sword!

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:53.611
Only a man with a singular purpose
who has forsaken all else can wield it!

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:57.866
You're all weighted down by the superfluous!

01:07:58.116 --> 01:07:58.741
Gin!

01:07:58.741 --> 01:07:59.868
Gin-chan!

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:03.288
The damned light won't go out!

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:06.332
IT WON'T GO OUT!

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:12.338
Tets u ko !

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:15.175
No more! No more killing!

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:18.094
I won't let another soul be killed by that sword!

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:27.812
Let the fluffy girl go...

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:30.899
...you giant!

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:43.118
Why? Why? Tetsuko?

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.287
Why don't you try to understand?

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:49.125
I gave my all to Benizakura!

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:52.337
I sacrificed my conscience and all moderation!

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:55.131
It's who I am!

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:58.343
Without it, I'm nothing!

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:04.599
We lost an ingenious craftsman.
There will never be another one like him.

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.435
I heard he had a son. What about him?

01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:09.145
He's no good.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:14.442
If his dad hadn't been so gifted,
it wouldn't have been so hard for him.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:18.154
He could have been happy
just making a living of it.

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:20.156
From that day...

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:25.953
Tetsuko, your skills are still lacking
but you have something Tetsuya doesn't.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:29.122
I hope he understands one day.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:32.585
I spent my whole life trying to surpass my father!

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:39.884
I gave up everything just to make swords.
I don't need anything else!

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:47.517
That's all I have! That's all there is left!

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:11.374
Brother!

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.478
Gin!
Gin-Chan!

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:36.899
Brother! Hang on! My brother!

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:38.735
Brother...

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.907
I see now.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:50.246
I thought I'd given up all that was superfluous...

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:58.254
I decided to live not as a man,
but as a swordsmith.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:06.262
But at the end of the day, I couldn't give you up...

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:14.354
I guess my commitment wasn't strong enough.
How could I expect to forge the ultimate sword?

01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:17.732
She's not superfluous.

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.151
Nothing's superfluous.

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:26.282
Sacrifice everything for the craft?
Is that a true craftsman?

01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:32.914
Stop kidding yourself.
You just didn't want to bother.

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:37.960
You don't have the guts to take
responsibility for anything.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:40.922
You're no master craftsman.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:51.307
Watch how powerful superfluous can be.

01:11:52.934 --> 01:12:00.650
This sword your sister forged is pure heart
and soul. Burn that into your retina.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.322
Gin! No!

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:07.323
Gin-chan!

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:25.007
A sword is but a blade that kills...
That won't change no matter what we do.

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:30.179
But that doesn't mean we
should abandon our craft.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:35.059
We need to earn a living. No, that's not all.

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:37.478
We're in the weapons business.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:40.815
That's why you have to keep forging.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:45.987
Not steel, but your soul.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:51.784
Forge your soul while you forge the steel.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:55.371
Be a kind, honest man. Live with integrity.

01:12:56.414 --> 01:13:03.838
If you better yourselves, you'll attract
people who'll make good swords.

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:07.383
What kind of sword do you want to forge?

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:10.386
A sword that protects...

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:13.181
Hmm? I can't hear you.

01:13:13.473 --> 01:13:16.476
A sword that protects.

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:29.697
It's too bright for me...

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:41.834
A sword that protects, huh? Typical of you.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:50.176
I guess... I'm still a novice yet.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:56.432
Become a good swordsmith, Tetsuko...

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.440
I can't hear you...

01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:11.030
You have to... yell like you always do...

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.450
I can't hear you!

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:27.129
Takasugi, I've never liked you. And I still don't.

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:32.260
But I consider you a comrade. Even now.

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:37.723
When did our paths diverge?

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:41.352
Hmph. What are you saying?

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:47.316
We may have started off in the same place...

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:52.488
But even back then,
we never shared the same goals.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.117
All doing our own things.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.203
All watching each other grow apart.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:04.333
I haven't changed one bit.

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:12.508
I'm still striving towards the same goal. I...

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:16.178
How's
-lha-I?!

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:18.764
Elizabeth, this is it.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:18.848
Rea//g?
Elizabeth, this is it.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:19.682
<i>Really</i> ?

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:27.523
What's that battleship?

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.816
Allied forces?

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:31.193
No... that flag...

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:34.947
What are they doing here?

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:38.242
It's the Harusame Space Pirates!

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.494
Zura...

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:46.542
You guys took up the sword
for your country, your comrades,

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.086
but I didn't give a crap about that.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:57.553
Think about it. Who taught us how
to use the sword?

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:03.559
The samurai code? The survival skills?
Who taught us all of that?

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:10.816
Who gave us a world to live in?
None other than... Master Shouyou.

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:16.572
An yet, this world robbed us of him.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:27.041
What can I do but declare war on it and
destroy the world that took him from us?

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:34.006
Zura, what do you have to live for?

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:41.013
How can we live in a world
that deprived us of our master?

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:44.725
I can't stand it!

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:51.357
Takasugi... You have no idea how often
I've wanted to destroy this Earth.

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:55.820
But he... he's bearing it.

01:16:56.654 --> 01:17:02.618
The one... who should hate this world
more than anybody.

01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:04.620
What can we do?

01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:14.255
I can't destroy this land.
There's too much here... that I love.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:19.260
I see you as someone who has lost
his chance to set things right.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:23.180
You've become a beast that
simply destroys for the pleasure of it.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:27.643
If you hate this land so much,
go ahead and destroy it.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:34.650
But I can't stand by and watch you
destroy the people of Edo too.

01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:41.782
There must be a way to change this country
without so much bloodshed.

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:43.784
I'm sure Master Shouyou...

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:46.036
It's Katsura.

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:47.913
It's really Katsura.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.791
Butt out. He's mine.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:52.376
The Amanto?

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.962
Zura, I heard about you.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:18:00.426
You fought against the Harusame,
with your buddy Gintoki.

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:06.432
I was thinking of hooking up with them anyway.

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:12.313
How convenient. <i>I'l</i> l just hand them your head.

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:13.814
Takasugi!

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:16.192
I told you...

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:20.446
All I want to do is destroy this rotting world.

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:29.955
What are the Harusame doing here?

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:30.080
How should
I know?!

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.540
How should
I know?!

01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:35.127
Lord Bansai...

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:39.673
We were promised the heads
of Katsura and Gintoki.

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:43.427
Lord Bansai? Are you listening to me?

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.971
I'm listening.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.723
They're the hottest band in Edo...

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:52.269
Pay attention! Who is this fool?
Why did they send him?

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:57.858
Don't worry. They're small fry. Friends of Katsura.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:59.735
It'll be over soon.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.740
Out of our way!

01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:06.826
Odd Jobs Gin-chan is coming!

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:10.454
You're so full of energy.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:11.747
That...

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.958
It's that samurai.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.590
Move it. I'm not in a very good mood.

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.509
Kats u ra !

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:32.893
Yo, Zura... What's with the hair?
Got your heart broken?

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.979
Shut up. I needed a change.

01:19:34.979 --> 01:19:38.691
And what about you? Were you hit by a bomb?

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.442
Shut up. I needed a change, too.

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.777
What kind of change?

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:43.904
Katsura! Tell us what to do!

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:44.780
Retreat.

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:50.786
Benizakura is finished. It's worthless now.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.330
We have to make an escape. Hurry!

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.541
You won't get away!

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:58.085
Kill them! Kill them all!

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:10.264
We've got it covered.

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:11.473
Go!

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:12.141
But...

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:12.808
Gin!
But...

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:17.813
Let go, Ellie! Gin-Chan!

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:25.279
Go! I want their heads!

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:00.064
Don't retreat! Push forward!

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:04.026
So that's Gintoki Sakata and Kotaro Katsura.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:07.279
They're strong. Worthy of a death match with me.

01:21:20.918 --> 01:21:21.627
Gintoki!

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:22.169
Yeah?

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:25.881
Change is never easy in this world!

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:30.469
I can't even change one friend,
let alone a country!

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:35.265
Zura! I didn't know you had friends!
Are you sure about that?

01:21:35.683 --> 01:21:37.643
Shall I cut you into shreds?

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:57.830
Gintoki!

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:58.831
Yeah?

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:04.920
Don't ever change!

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:10.926
Killing you would take too much effort!

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:16.682
Zura... If you change, <i>I'l</i> l be
the first to kill your ass!

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:21.937
Takasugi!

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.732
That's how it is.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:29.028
The next time we meet,
we're no longer comrades!

01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:32.239
<i>I'l</i> l take you down!

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:36.952
So you'd better hope
you don't bump into me in town!

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:44.835
See ya!

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.962
Don't let them get away! Shoot!

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:52.134
You're so prepared. What are you, Lupin?

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:53.969
Not Lupin! I'm Zura!

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.846
No, I mean Katsura!

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:59.975
This isn't the first time
I've evaded the Shinsengumi.

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:05.314
But who would have thought
that he'd still have this?

01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:12.571
We all started in the same place...

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:18.452
But... We've drifted so far apart...

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:25.542
Gintoki... do you still have it?

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:28.003
No.

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.757
I spilled ramen on it.

01:23:56.949 --> 01:24:04.206
Shi seru kaiwa no hajimari wo kimi to kyokan shitai
I want to share the beginning of the dying conversation

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:06.125
Mikansei na bokutachi wa
We're emotionally incomplete

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:07.376
Mikansei na bokutachi wa

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:08.585
Mikansei na bokutachi wa
We're emotionally incomplete

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:11.255
Kinou kyo no hanashi de
Influenced by what just happened yesterday and today

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:17.553
Yureru yureru yura yura yurete
We sway and sway

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:18.637
What is it? Yureru yureru yura
yura yurete We sway and sway

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:18.762
Yureru yureru yura yura yurete
We sway and sway

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:19.513
It looks like it's over. Yureru yureru
yura yura yurete We sway and sway

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:19.972
It looks like it's over.

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:21.265
It looks like it's over. Asobi
tsuzuketeru We keep on playing

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:21.598
Asobi tsuzuketeru
We keep on playing

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:24.977
Asobi tsuzuketeru

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:26.270
Tch. Yamazaki, go find out what went down.
Oh baby

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:27.062
Sir!
Oh baby

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:30.023
Kudaranai daro
Isn't it ridiculous?

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:31.942
Bakamitai daro
Isn't it stupid?

01:24:31.942 --> 01:24:35.028
Sonnakoto wasurete
Just forget about stuff like that

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:43.120
Shibui jidai ni amai mirai no shiru wo sosorasete
Let the bitter era invite the juice of the sweet future

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:49.835
Go to Edo, huh? What a pain. Boss' orders.

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:54.506
I'm looking forward to meeting those samurai.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:04.266
Toushindai no jibun wo shiru uchi ni
As I learn about the real me

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:11.648
Naze ka shiran chikara ga michiteku
The power that I didn't know of begins to flow

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:13.358
Oh baby

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:16.403
Uso mitai daro
Isn't it unbelievable?

01:25:16.403 --> 01:25:18.405
Arienai daro
Isn't it impossible?

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:21.533
Kanari fuuki midareta
The order is now quite disturbed

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:30.209

01:27:04.011 --> 01:27:07.306
We're not even in it!

01:27:07.306 --> 01:27:11.476
Gintama without Odd Jobs?

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:13.854
This is bogus! Who would do such a thing?

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:15.397
Us.

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:20.610
Sorry, but the Shinsengumi
will star in the sequel.

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:25.240
So you're the ones trying to fool
the fans with a bogus trailer!

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:28.577
But we've been fooling them all along, too.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:31.079
Why would you do such a thing?

01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:33.248
Because...

01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:37.586
We looked like idiots!
Did you see us in the Benizakura Arc?

01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:39.546
We look like a bunch of fools!

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:44.551
We got wind of Takasugi's plan,
but it was all over before we got there!

01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:47.012
We shouldn't have even appeared!

01:27:47.304 --> 01:27:50.724
And if we make the sequel, it won't be bogus.

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.267
That's right.

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:56.813
I won't accept a Gintama without Gin!

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:58.273
Me, either!

01:27:58.982 --> 01:28:02.277
Move it! Otose coming through!

01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:05.697
I was on the poster, so I wondered
when I was going to appear,

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:10.118
and there I was at the end,
this small with no lines.

01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:15.874
Some fans like grannies
and cat-eared ladies, too!

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:18.293
I think very few.

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:20.712
So the sequel will be called:

01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:22.964
Catch My Heart, Kitty Cat.

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:26.426
Hold it right there!
Who's going to go see a movie like that?

01:28:26.426 --> 01:28:29.304
I certainly won't!

01:28:29.388 --> 01:28:30.680
Sacchan!

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:35.602
It looked like Otae was your leading lady!

01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:42.943
I'm your leading lady!
We have a sticky relationship, remember?

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.403
Sorry about that.

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:46.321
Sis?

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:50.492
You can do whatever you want
with that kinky-haired fool,

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:53.662
but I'm the heroine of the sequel.

01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:56.623
And of course, your leading man is...

01:28:57.416 --> 01:29:01.294
Don't think you're hot just because
you got a tiny part...

01:29:01.294 --> 01:29:03.422
I'm the next heroine!

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:06.550
KYLI-Chan?

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:09.511
If Otae-chan is the heroine, then I'm the hero.

01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:11.555
I don't think it works that way!

01:29:11.763 --> 01:29:13.598
I'm the hero!

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:14.850
What?

01:29:15.392 --> 01:29:18.353
The heroes of Gintama are Gin and Tama!

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:23.775
Just Gin is fine. You're stepping
on his Tama by the way.

01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:26.778
Don't do it, sir!

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:29.990
Heroes and heroines always have
steamy sex scenes.

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:36.079
That means you'll have to

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:39.291
HEY! What kind of movies are you watching?

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:42.919
I only got to narrate the trailer.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:45.297
Where did you come from?

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:47.507
Is it going to be dubbed?

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:51.720
Never! What the heck's wrong with all of y-

01:29:55.140 --> 01:30:00.395
Sorry I'm late, Kintoki. Where's my part?

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:03.315
Just at the opening and ending!

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:08.320
The sequel should definitely
be starring Captain Katsura and *****...

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.405
Enough already!

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:11.823
Are you kidding me?

01:30:11.823 --> 01:30:13.742
Catch My Heart, Kitty Cat!

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:16.411
The sequel will feature Gin and me.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:18.413
I told you I'm the heroine.

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:20.707
Otae and I will ****!

01:30:20.707 --> 01:30:23.418
Sir, may I suggest **** over ****!

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:28.215
Wait a minute. We called it first.
The Shinsengumi!

01:30:28.215 --> 01:30:32.219
How about me?

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:42.729
Shut up! I'm the hero!

01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:44.731
And I'm the heroine!

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:48.652
This is crazy. What are we going to do?

01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:51.988
Cut! Cut!

01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:00.163
This is too much. We quit.

01:31:01.498 --> 01:31:02.832
It's...

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:04.668
<i>Mr. War and Mr. Nev'.</i>!

01:31:04.668 --> 01:31:07.295
They really do exist! The Warner Brothers!

01:31:07.504 --> 01:31:12.300
What is this mess? You tricked us brothers!

01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:16.680
This anime is supposed to be
a mega-hit in Japan? You lied to us!

01:31:17.347 --> 01:31:19.933
This isn't Gintama.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.687
Those aren't samurai either.
They're ninja and soul reapers and...

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:29.693
We can't do business in the
global marketplace with this vulgar anime.

01:31:29.901 --> 01:31:32.862
That's it! Forever!

01:31:32.862 --> 01:31:33.947
GOOd-bye!

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:41.496
What about our sequel?

01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:47.085
So, Gintama is over?

01:31:47.544 --> 01:31:51.298
Hmph. A vulgar anime?

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:53.341
That's the ultimate compliment.

01:31:54.384 --> 01:31:58.471
The end? Are you kidding?

01:31:58.722 --> 01:32:00.515
We've only just begun.

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:05.353
I don't get it. But I know those lyrics.

01:32:31.004 --> 01:32:37.427
Kensou to ranbu no mani koufun suru kuruoshisa de
Raging excitement in the midst of bustle and wild dance

It's the truth

01:32:43.141 --> 01:32:47.312
Souzou suru yori genshou wo honemi no zui ni sase yo
Stab the phenomenon into the spine of the flesh

01:32:47.312 --> 01:32:50.357
Souzou suru yori genshou wo honemi no zui ni sase yo
Rather than imagining it

01:32:50.357 --> 01:32:55.278
