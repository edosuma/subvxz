WEBVTT

00:03.798 --> 00:06.331
Ew. Are you doing laundry
on the stove

00:06.418 --> 00:07.490
like in olden times?

00:07.577 --> 00:08.641
Oh, my God.
Are we poor?

00:08.728 --> 00:10.446
I knew Dad's magic shop
would destroy us.

00:10.533 --> 00:13.321
No, it is my Aunt Becky's
favorite tomato soup,

00:13.408 --> 00:14.456
and I am bringing it
to her

00:14.543 --> 00:16.055
because she's recovering
from a stroke.

00:16.142 --> 00:18.516
Is she the mean one you guys
used to be so scared of?

00:18.603 --> 00:20.409
Oh, God, yes,
especially Uncle Mitchell.

00:20.496 --> 00:21.818
It was like
he was a weak gazelle

00:21.905 --> 00:23.794
and she was
a hungry, homophobic cheetah.

00:23.881 --> 00:25.766
No offense,
but that soup stinks.

00:25.853 --> 00:27.347
No, it smells fine.

00:27.434 --> 00:29.331
Is someone
burning Frisbees?

00:29.418 --> 00:30.472
It's soup!

00:30.568 --> 00:32.692
No, that's not it.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.579
Oh, look at you
all dressed up.

00:34.666 --> 00:36.453
Coming with us
to watch Uncle Mitchell sweat?

00:36.540 --> 00:38.323
No, Arvin's dad is in
from London,

00:38.410 --> 00:39.591
and he wants me
to meet him.

00:40.058 --> 00:41.198
Hang on.

00:41.285 --> 00:42.502
You're not hungover.

00:42.589 --> 00:45.000
Hair's conservative,
no cleavage.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.969
Oh, my God. You're trying
to make a good impression.

00:47.056 --> 00:49.025
- You're in love!
- Shut up. I am not.

00:49.112 --> 00:50.106
Ohh, I don't know.

00:50.193 --> 00:51.895
I see how hard you work
at this relationship.

00:51.982 --> 00:53.401
You woke up early
to watch soccer

00:53.488 --> 00:54.682
and you called it
football.

00:54.769 --> 00:56.010
Oh, just calm down.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.206
It's been three months,

00:57.293 --> 00:59.792
and everyone knows Liverpool
is having a cracking good year.

00:59.879 --> 01:02.818
Still, meeting a parent is
a major relationship milestone.

01:02.905 --> 01:04.093
Claire,
you're getting my hopes up,

01:04.181 --> 01:05.635
and I still haven't recovered
from Andy.

01:05.722 --> 01:07.159
And don't even get me started
on Dylan.

01:07.246 --> 01:10.404
I get nostalgic every time I see
someone sleeping in their car.

01:11.025 --> 01:12.094
You nervous?

01:12.181 --> 01:14.446
No. And even if I were,
I've got it covered.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.611
I've got these new stickers
from NERP.

01:16.725 --> 01:19.268
So, our latest product

01:19.355 --> 01:22.193
is the most amazing
scientific breakthrough...

01:23.012 --> 01:24.559
Stickers!

01:24.646 --> 01:25.504
Oh, you're a genius.

01:25.591 --> 01:27.159
What an amazing time
we live in. I can't.

01:27.246 --> 01:29.284
So, they're designed
to reduce stress

01:29.371 --> 01:31.760
and to help you
boldly pursue greatness

01:31.847 --> 01:33.659
by scrambling the rational part
of the brain

01:33.746 --> 01:36.763
that asks,
"Does this seem right?"

01:37.793 --> 01:41.573
Anyway, since I can't test
on laboratory rats,

01:41.660 --> 01:43.808
I'm gonna need you guys
to try them.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.189
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:45.276 --> 01:47.409
So, wait...
No one here has a pacemaker

01:47.496 --> 01:49.395
or lawyer parents,
right?

01:49.882 --> 01:51.057
No.
No.

01:51.196 --> 01:53.074
Then test away!

02:02.475 --> 02:05.422
<font color=#FF00FF>*MODERN FAMILY</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 09  Episode 21</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Escape"</font>

02:05.697 --> 02:07.970
I'll go see
what room Becky's in,

02:08.056 --> 02:10.326
or we can just feel
for which doorknob is cold.

02:10.413 --> 02:12.373
Phil, Phil. Did you see
what's across the street?

02:12.460 --> 02:13.933
An escape room. Oh, I did.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.065
No,
we're not doing that. No way in hell.

02:16.152 --> 02:17.659
She also said no
to ice cream.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.111
Escape room?
What is that?

02:19.198 --> 02:21.019
Oh, it's a themed room
that they lock you in,

02:21.106 --> 02:23.196
and then you have to solve
puzzles and clues

02:23.283 --> 02:24.607
to, um, you know,
escape.

02:24.694 --> 02:26.388
Or they cut off
your finger?

02:26.475 --> 02:27.934
What? No.

02:28.021 --> 02:29.339
It's just for fun.Yeah.

02:29.426 --> 02:31.183
Oh, but then that lowers
the stakes.

02:31.270 --> 02:33.579
Okay. She's in Room 208.
Let's go.

02:34.553 --> 02:36.980
Jay, did you hear
that there is an escape room

02:37.067 --> 02:37.974
across the street?

02:38.061 --> 02:39.159
- We're not doing that.
- Why not?

02:39.246 --> 02:41.142
Because when you get
in a stressful situation,

02:41.229 --> 02:42.178
you start to scream,

02:42.265 --> 02:44.212
and I'm not taking that show
into a locked room.

02:44.299 --> 02:46.534
Yeah, and this one gets panicked
if he's stuck in traffic

02:46.621 --> 02:47.634
for more than
five minutes.

02:47.721 --> 02:48.748
Guess
it's just you and me.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.012
Oh, hard pass, honey.

02:50.099 --> 02:51.187
In a confined space,

02:51.274 --> 02:53.181
you're just bouncing
off the wall like Flubber.

02:53.268 --> 02:56.464
It's no secret my sister Becky
and I have our differences.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.194
They haven't talked
in nine years.

02:58.281 --> 02:59.480
She's kind of a monster.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.769
I've only met her once,
at our wedding.

03:01.856 --> 03:05.225
Imagine if you took
all of Jay's worst qualities

03:05.312 --> 03:06.942
and wrapped them
in a pantsuit.

03:07.029 --> 03:08.485
But as soon as I heard
she had a stroke,

03:08.572 --> 03:10.089
I knew I had to rush
to her side.

03:10.176 --> 03:11.297
It happened
three weeks ago.

03:11.384 --> 03:13.772
Right in the middle
of hockey playoffs!

03:13.859 --> 03:15.538
Typical Becky!

03:16.645 --> 03:18.823
Okay. There she is.

03:18.910 --> 03:20.324
Hi, Aunt Becky.

03:20.411 --> 03:21.481
I think she's sleeping.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.808
With the same mean old puss
on her face.

03:23.895 --> 03:25.519
Hey, Mitchell. Why don't you
give her a little kiss?

03:25.606 --> 03:26.806
You give her
a little kiss.No.

03:26.893 --> 03:28.030
Who's there?

03:28.726 --> 03:31.759
Oh! My darling family.

03:31.846 --> 03:32.995
You came.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.417
Something's wrong
with her mouth.

03:34.504 --> 03:35.683
She's smiling.

03:35.770 --> 03:38.824
Mitchell,
you've gotten so handsome.

03:38.911 --> 03:41.334
Have you finally met
a good woman?

03:41.421 --> 03:42.636
I'm sorry. What?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.417
You're messing with me,
right, Becky? You know that...

03:44.504 --> 03:46.733
Hey, folks, can I speak
with you for a second?

03:47.012 --> 03:49.139
This is just like
when I came out years ago.

03:49.226 --> 03:50.516
She knows
what she's doing.

03:50.603 --> 03:52.068
Actually, she doesn't.

03:52.155 --> 03:55.038
The stroke may have scrambled
some of Becky's memories.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.024
So she doesn't remember me
coming out?

03:57.111 --> 03:58.064
Correct.

03:58.254 --> 04:00.420
And now presumes
you're straight.

04:00.582 --> 04:02.214
That part
I can't explain.

04:02.301 --> 04:04.046
Have you tried popping
her on the noggin?

04:04.133 --> 04:05.972
She's not a jukebox,
Fonzie.

04:06.059 --> 04:07.473
And besides,
it doesn't work.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.597
It only made my uncle worse.
He never woke up.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.920
Well, hopefully
her memory will return.

04:13.007 --> 04:15.983
Often, it's the little things
that trigger recollection...

04:16.070 --> 04:20.182
A smell, a song, a picture,
even just her family.

04:20.450 --> 04:22.741
Thank you.
Thank you so much, doctor.

04:24.410 --> 04:25.825
Did you kill
your uncle?

04:26.143 --> 04:27.648
She doesn't remember
I'm gay.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.122
Yeah, no, I know. I was here
for the whole explanation.

04:30.209 --> 04:32.017
This means I get to come out
to her again.

04:32.104 --> 04:33.945
It was a disaster
the first time.

04:34.032 --> 04:35.970
I was...
I was so wishy-washy

04:36.057 --> 04:38.104
about the whole thing
that when I finally said,

04:38.191 --> 04:39.660
"I-I think I might be gay,"

04:39.747 --> 04:41.179
she said, "Ew."

04:41.266 --> 04:44.068
Are you sure
she didn't mean, "Ooh"?

04:44.155 --> 04:46.249
No, no. It was followed up
by a whole bunch of stuff

04:46.336 --> 04:48.075
- about me making Jesus cry.
- Oh.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.517
For 20 years, I've regretted
that moment,

04:50.604 --> 04:53.194
and today, I get the chance
to make it right.

04:53.281 --> 04:56.316
Or you could just leave
a poor, old demented woman alone

04:56.403 --> 04:59.645
and not make her stroke
all about you.

04:59.954 --> 05:01.997
Why do I even bring you
to these things?

05:02.768 --> 05:03.775
Wow.

05:03.862 --> 05:06.337
Well, Aunt Becky,
what a necklace.

05:06.424 --> 05:07.707
Oh. Isn't it lovely?

05:07.794 --> 05:11.124
It was a gift from a prince
I met in Liechtenstein.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.462
- Really?
- Mm-mmm.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.915
Phil, that is my necklace.

05:16.002 --> 05:18.494
I lent it to her
for Dad and Gloria's wedding,

05:18.581 --> 05:19.603
and she never
gave it back.

05:19.690 --> 05:20.839
She said she lost it.

05:20.926 --> 05:22.682
Claire, the woman
just had a stroke.

05:22.769 --> 05:26.712
When I graduated, my mother
gave me a very special necklace,

05:26.799 --> 05:29.736
which I returned
so I could get that necklace.

05:29.823 --> 05:30.913
I'm getting it back.

05:31.000 --> 05:31.895
Where are you going?

05:31.982 --> 05:33.296
I'm going
to heat up the soup.

05:33.383 --> 05:35.149
Maybe the smell
will jog her memory.

05:35.236 --> 05:36.697
Hasn't she suffered enough?

05:36.784 --> 05:39.181
I guess I'm proudest
of these two little guys here.

05:39.268 --> 05:42.314
This is the Spacemaster 500,
and this is the Xanadu...

05:42.401 --> 05:45.447
Newest additions to
the Pritchett's Closets family.

05:45.534 --> 05:47.228
What's
Pritchett's Closets?

05:47.315 --> 05:49.429
This damn disease doesn't care
what it destroys.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.705
I know
what would help you remember.

05:51.792 --> 05:54.319
Joe and Manny made you
a "get well" video.

05:54.406 --> 05:55.542
Oh.

05:56.182 --> 05:57.564
Oh. You know what?

05:57.651 --> 05:59.359
I forgot my cellphone
in the car.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.602
I'll be right back.

06:00.689 --> 06:02.681
Oh, thank you, Dede.

06:02.768 --> 06:04.235
Breathe.

06:04.357 --> 06:06.357
Are you comfortable?
Can I help you with anything

06:06.512 --> 06:07.289
that's not disgusting?

06:07.376 --> 06:08.645
I'm fine.

06:08.775 --> 06:10.794
But I was wondering if,
this summer,

06:10.881 --> 06:12.772
I could borrow
your fishing cabin.

06:12.859 --> 06:14.258
My fishing cabin?

06:14.345 --> 06:17.151
My dad had a fishing cabin
that he promised would go to me,

06:17.238 --> 06:20.094
but the double-crossing bastard
left it to my sister Becky,

06:20.181 --> 06:21.737
who's also
a double-crosser.

06:21.824 --> 06:23.682
Now that her memory
is Swiss cheese,

06:23.769 --> 06:25.334
I can steal my cabin back.

06:25.421 --> 06:27.630
Finally,
the good guy wins.

06:30.928 --> 06:32.104
Hello, Father.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.385
Arvin, my boy!

06:33.472 --> 06:35.724
Uh, allow me
to introduce to you...

06:35.811 --> 06:36.977
Haley Dunphy.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.666
Malcolm Fennerman.
It is my pleasure.

06:39.753 --> 06:40.891
Nicely done, son.

06:40.978 --> 06:43.068
Glad to see you've got yourself
a little lass.

06:43.660 --> 06:45.421
- He said "lass."
- Ah.

06:45.508 --> 06:47.924
Oh, by the way,
slight change in plan.

06:48.011 --> 06:50.120
Um, at the last minute,
your mum decided

06:50.207 --> 06:51.635
to join me on the trip.

06:51.722 --> 06:52.924
What?
Yes.

06:53.011 --> 06:54.545
I, um, can't go anywhere
by myself

06:54.632 --> 06:56.388
after that weekend
in Brighton.

06:56.481 --> 06:57.872
Mum's coming here? Now?

06:57.959 --> 06:59.055
Is everything okay?

06:59.142 --> 07:00.399
Is there time
to get a drink?

07:00.486 --> 07:02.310
I'm afraid not.
Man your battle stations.

07:02.397 --> 07:03.730
Hello.

07:05.417 --> 07:07.392
I am Dr. Iris Fennerman.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.862
So nice to finally meet
the woman

07:08.949 --> 07:10.263
with whom my son
is so enamored

07:10.350 --> 07:11.880
and yet I know
nothing about.

07:12.010 --> 07:14.713
Well, I'm just
your average American girl,

07:14.800 --> 07:16.607
although much thinner,
thank God.

07:16.694 --> 07:18.697
Oh,
also I work at NERP.NERP?

07:18.784 --> 07:23.633
N-Na-Nano Electronics
Research Project.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.572
Oh? Yeah, Haley is a colleague.

07:25.659 --> 07:27.384
It's very top-secret,
though. Hush, hush.

07:27.471 --> 07:29.075
We probably
already said too much.

07:29.503 --> 07:31.320
Malcolm, how is it
we are not seated yet?

07:31.407 --> 07:32.602
Well, I didn't want to...

07:32.689 --> 07:34.474
Pi... pick
the wrong table again.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.281
Oh, don't be silly.
I'd be happy anywhere.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.661
Since when?

07:40.021 --> 07:42.439
"Nano Electronics"?
What was that?

07:42.526 --> 07:43.713
Please,
just play along.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.823
What's all that whispering
back there?

07:44.910 --> 07:47.724
Uh, nothing, Mum.
Just, um, science talk.

07:49.652 --> 07:51.073
Ugh, I had to get away.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.974
It's getting way
too Pritchett-y in there.

07:53.062 --> 07:55.429
Why can't they just let this be
a fun nursing-home visit?

07:55.516 --> 07:57.627
Exactly.
We're in Riverside.

07:57.714 --> 07:59.308
We should be
tearing it up.

07:59.395 --> 08:00.984
Hey, let's go
to that escape room.

08:01.071 --> 08:02.503
I am in.

08:02.628 --> 08:04.565
Hey, Gloria.
We're going to the escape room.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.206
- You want to come?
- That sounds fun.

08:06.293 --> 08:07.261
Gloria!

08:07.573 --> 08:09.682
I think Jay needs me.
He's very sad.

08:09.769 --> 08:11.270
- Oh!
- Forget the videos.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.372
We have to keep her
from remembering anything

08:13.459 --> 08:15.495
so I can nab
her fishing cabin!

08:15.582 --> 08:17.880
I suddenly feel like
escaping.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.111
I'm so glad
we're doing this.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.786
I know. Me, too.

08:26.175 --> 08:29.505
Oh, well, I don't...
I don't think this is the way.

08:30.081 --> 08:31.215
What is this place?

08:31.302 --> 08:33.390
I don't know.
Let's just go back up.

08:33.519 --> 08:35.705
Oh, no.
It's locked!

08:35.792 --> 08:37.405
Okay, call someone.
I don't have a cellphone.

08:37.493 --> 08:38.837
Okay, well,
I don't have any service.

08:38.924 --> 08:40.775
I don't either.
Guys, if we don't figure out

08:40.863 --> 08:41.784
a way to get out of here
soon,

08:41.871 --> 08:44.075
we're never gonna make it
to the escape room.

08:47.044 --> 08:49.936
Haley, I know your job
is top secret,

08:50.023 --> 08:53.166
but I'm so fascinated
by nanotechnology...

08:53.253 --> 08:55.424
Self-replicating robots
and such.

08:55.511 --> 08:58.080
I'd love to hear your insight
into grey goo.

08:58.167 --> 08:59.534
Ooh, I can answer that.

08:59.621 --> 09:01.041
It's my favorite vodka.

09:01.128 --> 09:02.387
Hmm?

09:04.037 --> 09:07.702
Enough about me.
Um, I love your blazer.

09:07.826 --> 09:09.484
Do you have a corgi
like the queen?

09:09.571 --> 09:11.340
Crazy times in London.
Am I right?

09:11.427 --> 09:13.703
I hear that your, um, bridge
is falling down,

09:13.790 --> 09:14.823
falling down.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.485
Haley is obviously joking.

09:17.572 --> 09:20.903
It's that... It's that Yankee
sense of humor, you know.

09:20.990 --> 09:22.179
"Eat my shorts."

09:22.266 --> 09:23.763
"Schwing!"

09:23.921 --> 09:25.551
What is that
on your arm?

09:25.638 --> 09:26.731
Oh, it's my elbow.

09:26.818 --> 09:28.932
How delightful.

09:29.019 --> 09:30.494
10 points
for Gryffindor.

09:30.581 --> 09:32.332
No,
the sticker-y thing.

09:32.419 --> 09:33.707
Oh, it's actually
from my work.

09:33.794 --> 09:35.028
It channels the energy
of your brain...

09:35.115 --> 09:36.307
Aah-bup-bup-ma-bup-bup!

09:36.394 --> 09:38.445
Can't talk about that.
Remember?

09:38.544 --> 09:40.531
Fine.
Then let's talk about Arvin.

09:40.724 --> 09:44.418
Have you reached a decision
on your research fellowship?

09:46.816 --> 09:49.420
I have decided
not to take it.

09:49.518 --> 09:52.209
Why not? I mean, you'd be
working on the CERN collider...

09:52.296 --> 09:54.218
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime!

09:54.305 --> 09:56.485
Well, I don't feel like
spending six months

09:56.572 --> 09:58.517
underground
in S-Switzerland.

09:58.604 --> 10:00.908
Oh, please, don't tell me you're
turning this down because of a girl.

10:00.995 --> 10:02.408
Listen, I had nothing to do
with this.

10:02.495 --> 10:04.322
Oh, darling, you have everything
to do with this.

10:04.409 --> 10:05.657
You've always shown
bad judgment

10:05.744 --> 10:07.002
when it comes
to a pretty girl.

10:07.089 --> 10:08.314
That's not fair. Oh, thank you.

10:08.401 --> 10:09.807
But at least
you've never let one of them

10:09.894 --> 10:11.710
get in the way
of your career.

10:12.294 --> 10:14.134
Look, I'm not getting in the way
of anything.

10:14.251 --> 10:16.203
Arvin never told me
about it,

10:16.370 --> 10:18.457
and even if he did,
I wouldn't understand.

10:18.544 --> 10:21.307
The NERP I work for
is a website run by an actress

10:21.394 --> 10:22.509
who thinks
she knows science

10:22.596 --> 10:23.906
because, once in
a James Bond movie,

10:23.993 --> 10:26.679
she played a nuclear physicist,
Dr. Mona Lott.

10:26.903 --> 10:28.153
Haley!
Where are you going?

10:28.240 --> 10:30.412
Oh, I was offered a fellowship
to the bathroom,

10:30.499 --> 10:32.055
and I'm accepting it!

10:41.771 --> 10:43.439
Do you remember
that security system

10:43.526 --> 10:45.443
I had installed
in my fishing cabin?

10:45.530 --> 10:47.926
I gave you the code
the last time I let you use it.

10:48.013 --> 10:49.590
I can't seem
to recall it.

10:49.677 --> 10:51.278
Well, okay.
Let me think.

10:51.365 --> 10:53.395
The cabin, the cabin.

10:53.482 --> 10:55.607
Oh. So pretty up there.

10:55.845 --> 10:57.827
Did I have a husband?
Dead.

10:57.947 --> 11:00.786
Now focus on the code
and nothing else.

11:00.873 --> 11:03.981
Hey, look who made you
your favorite soup.

11:04.068 --> 11:07.173
Nothing like a familiar smell
to bring back memories.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.750
- She ate.
- I did? But I'm sort of hungry.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.625
Well, feed a cold,
starve a stroke.

11:11.727 --> 11:13.087
- Get that out of her.
- I made this for you

11:13.159 --> 11:14.695
when
you came to Dad's wedding.

11:14.818 --> 11:17.248
Uh-huh. That's right.
You got remarried

11:17.431 --> 11:18.948
to that
Puerto Rican woman.

11:19.035 --> 11:21.410
You looked so beautiful
at that wedding...

11:21.497 --> 11:23.643
Your dress, your shoes,
the jewelry.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.203
Come here a second.
Excuse me.

11:25.290 --> 11:26.422
What the hell
are you up to?

11:26.509 --> 11:27.565
She stole my necklace.

11:27.652 --> 11:29.151
So you try to manipulate
a sick woman

11:29.238 --> 11:30.500
for your own
personal agenda?

11:30.587 --> 11:32.055
Aunt Becky, hi.

11:32.142 --> 11:34.110
You remember when you came
to see me ice dance,

11:34.197 --> 11:37.131
you said that I looked like
a little sissy, well, I... Daddy!

11:37.218 --> 11:38.736
Ow, What the hell...

11:39.331 --> 11:40.651
I am ashamed
of the both of you.

11:40.738 --> 11:41.894
That's my sister in there.

11:41.981 --> 11:43.396
I almost lost her once.

11:43.521 --> 11:44.922
I don't want to have to lose...

11:45.009 --> 11:46.653
Oh, God.
Oh, Dad.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.258
I'm so sorry.

11:48.345 --> 11:49.806
Uh, we're so sorry.

11:49.893 --> 11:51.393
You're right.
We're being petty.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.875
Well, Claire's is
about a necklace

11:52.962 --> 11:54.272
and mine's about living
my truth, but I get...

11:54.359 --> 11:55.560
I get how
this isn't the right time.

11:55.647 --> 11:56.635
I'm sorry I snapped.

11:56.722 --> 11:57.971
This is just hard,
you know?

11:58.058 --> 12:00.158
Excuse me. Your sister said
she remembers something

12:00.245 --> 12:02.687
about the security code
to your fishing cabin?

12:02.948 --> 12:05.619
Well, I... I thought
it was her fishing cabin?

12:05.706 --> 12:07.830
Oh, my God,
and she thinks it's yours,

12:07.917 --> 12:09.947
and you don't want her
to remember it.

12:10.034 --> 12:11.357
Okay, fine.
You're right.

12:11.801 --> 12:13.771
But before you start
throwing stones,

12:13.972 --> 12:15.882
maybe look deep
into your own...

12:15.969 --> 12:17.260
- What?
- What?

12:17.347 --> 12:19.340
- Dad. Dad.
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:19.427 --> 12:22.409
All right. We shouldn't be
panicking, right?

12:22.496 --> 12:23.607
No, of course not.

12:23.675 --> 12:25.366
There's got to be a million ways
out of here.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.885
There's a security camera.

12:26.972 --> 12:30.410
Oh, no. No, no.
It's old and broke.

12:30.497 --> 12:34.552
Hey! Hey!
We're stuck in here!

12:34.639 --> 12:37.113
Gloria. Gloria, that didn't work
five minutes ago,

12:37.200 --> 12:39.514
and it didn't work
10 minutes ago.

12:39.601 --> 12:41.160
Why can't they hear me?

12:41.247 --> 12:43.515
This vent
has to go somewhere.

12:43.602 --> 12:46.626
Gloria Maria Ramirez
Delgado Pritchett,

12:46.713 --> 12:48.467
- you are a genius.
- I know.

12:48.554 --> 12:50.335
Give me a boost.
No, it should be me.

12:50.422 --> 12:51.877
Right. Gloria,
give Cam a boost.

12:51.964 --> 12:53.942
No, I mean,
I should give you a boost.

12:54.029 --> 12:55.043
Process works.

12:55.130 --> 12:56.607
Why don't we use
that trunk?

12:56.694 --> 12:59.034
See?! We just make
each other better.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.770
Right, chair, chair.
Who needs Pritchetts?!

13:01.857 --> 13:02.869
I'll steady it.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.730
Thank you again.

13:04.843 --> 13:06.472
Okay. Okay, grate.

13:06.559 --> 13:07.684
You're great.

13:07.903 --> 13:09.242
Oh, this grate.

13:09.329 --> 13:11.981
I got it. All right.

13:12.068 --> 13:14.454
Let's Die Hard
this puppy.

13:14.541 --> 13:16.761
That's my shoulder.

13:16.848 --> 13:18.859
Okay, in we go.

13:18.946 --> 13:21.211
All right, now, Phil,
every couple of feet, knock

13:21.298 --> 13:22.767
so we know
where you are.

13:22.854 --> 13:23.938
Got it.

13:24.048 --> 13:25.833
- Okay?
- Guys, I think I see an opening.

13:25.920 --> 13:26.996
We're saved.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.207
Yippie-ki-yay, mother...

13:28.294 --> 13:29.576
oh, dear God.

13:29.663 --> 13:30.676
Phil? Phil?
Phil?!

13:30.763 --> 13:32.531
Good news, guys.
I see two people.

13:32.618 --> 13:34.566
Maybe I can get a...
Oh, it's you.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.047
- Hello?
- Haley, I'm sorry.

13:38.134 --> 13:39.890
You had every right
to run out of the restaurant.

13:39.977 --> 13:41.828
You know, I've put up
with a lot from boyfriends...

13:41.915 --> 13:43.926
Futons, video games,
wives.

13:44.013 --> 13:45.677
But you were ashamed
of me.

13:45.764 --> 13:48.037
My mother
is a judgmental snob!

13:48.124 --> 13:50.109
I-I wanted her
to like you.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.294
I know I just...
I handled it all wrong.

13:52.381 --> 13:53.565
But please come back.

13:53.652 --> 13:55.812
No! You made me feel bad
about myself,

13:55.899 --> 13:57.976
and I deserve better
than that, okay?

13:58.149 --> 13:59.867
So just go to Switzerland

13:59.954 --> 14:03.286
and just sit in a big thing
of, like, Swiss chocolate

14:03.373 --> 14:04.842
and...
And yodel, okay?

14:04.929 --> 14:06.137
We're done.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.665
Oh, my God.

14:11.605 --> 14:13.259
Are you okay?

14:13.346 --> 14:15.472
Why do
you all have accents?

14:19.498 --> 14:22.254
Ugh.
What happened?

14:22.341 --> 14:23.341
You passed out.

14:23.428 --> 14:24.825
Those stickers
on your arms are loaded

14:24.912 --> 14:26.702
with... all sorts of chemicals.

14:26.789 --> 14:28.379
We called
your emergency contacts.

14:28.466 --> 14:29.967
Your boyfriend's here.

14:30.639 --> 14:32.296
Hey, sunshine.

14:35.469 --> 14:38.875
Andy? You... You came
all the way from Utah?

14:38.962 --> 14:41.581
Oh, no. I was in town
for a self-help seminar...

14:41.668 --> 14:43.668
"How To Be In The Right Place
at the Right Time."

14:43.755 --> 14:45.248
Holy cow.
It's working.

14:45.335 --> 14:47.289
Oh, gosh, I guess your name
must still be in my phone

14:47.376 --> 14:48.686
as my emergency contact.

14:48.773 --> 14:51.281
I use boyfriends to avoid
lectures from my parents.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.492
I don't want to wake up
in a Tijuana prison

14:53.579 --> 14:56.205
and them be all like,
"You're grounded."

14:56.477 --> 14:58.151
I'm just glad
I could be here.

14:58.368 --> 15:01.281
Andy, um, I have
to tell you something.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.522
And I'm really,
really sorry,

15:03.609 --> 15:05.791
but I'm seeing someone.

15:06.255 --> 15:08.185
Really?
Yeah.

15:08.714 --> 15:10.752
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

15:10.839 --> 15:12.144
Oh, thank goodness.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.620
Me, too. I just didn't know
how to tell you,

15:14.707 --> 15:15.959
especially
if you were dying.

15:16.046 --> 15:17.465
Oh.
She's a Laker girl.

15:17.552 --> 15:19.661
Oh, wow.
A cheerleader. Nice.

15:19.748 --> 15:20.939
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

15:21.026 --> 15:22.824
Josephine scrapes barnacles
off boats

15:22.911 --> 15:23.920
in the Great Salt Lake.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.217
We call them Laker girls.

15:25.304 --> 15:27.767
But they are kind of sex symbols
in Utah.

15:28.030 --> 15:30.380
So, who is the lucky guy?

15:30.467 --> 15:33.318
Well, it's a bit of a mess
right now,

15:33.405 --> 15:37.604
but, um, he is a professor
and an astrophysicist.

15:37.691 --> 15:39.373
He's a... a legit genius.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.746
Haley! I came as soon
as I heard.

15:41.833 --> 15:43.186
Actually,
that's not true.

15:43.273 --> 15:44.767
I stopped for tacos.

15:45.491 --> 15:46.569
Not him.

15:47.248 --> 15:48.711
Anybody got a spoon?

15:48.798 --> 15:50.140
We could Shawshank
this thing.

15:50.355 --> 15:52.594
It didn't go so well
when you Die Hard-ed it.

15:52.681 --> 15:54.010
Okay.
Full disclosure.

15:54.097 --> 15:55.695
If I don't feel supported,
I tend to shut down.

15:55.782 --> 15:56.737
Okay.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.835
I'm, um...
I'm getting stuffy.

15:58.922 --> 16:00.370
Is... Is it getting stuffy
in here?

16:00.457 --> 16:02.564
Come on. There's got to be
something in this place

16:02.651 --> 16:03.655
that can help us.

16:03.742 --> 16:05.206
Hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa! A phone!

16:05.293 --> 16:06.634
Is there a plug around here?

16:06.721 --> 16:08.111
There's a phone.
There's got to be a plug.

16:08.198 --> 16:09.031
Everybody look
for a plug!

16:09.118 --> 16:10.751
What if nobody looks
down here?!

16:10.838 --> 16:12.470
You know,
how are we gonna survive?

16:12.557 --> 16:13.915
I... I had a protein bar
in my car.

16:14.002 --> 16:15.095
I don't know why
I didn't bring it in.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.366
- Got to be a plug.
- There is no plug!

16:17.453 --> 16:19.304
It was peanut butter
and 20 grams of protein.

16:19.391 --> 16:21.377
Guys, if it comes to it,
and I mean this...

16:21.464 --> 16:22.933
I want you guys to eat me.

16:23.020 --> 16:26.139
As I told you before,
in those elevators

16:26.226 --> 16:28.426
and in the traffic jam
years ago,

16:28.513 --> 16:29.887
I am not going to eat you.

16:29.974 --> 16:32.784
Okay, you say that now,
but we may not get out of here,

16:32.871 --> 16:34.866
and we may have
to make some hard decisions.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.079
Look what is happening!

16:36.166 --> 16:38.259
Exactly what they said
is going to happen!

16:38.346 --> 16:40.957
You're bouncing off the walls
and you're panicking!

16:41.044 --> 16:42.788
- And you're yelling.
- No, I'm not.

16:42.875 --> 16:43.935
Look,
Claire may be right.

16:44.022 --> 16:45.001
I may be unfocused,
but...

16:45.088 --> 16:46.501
But she wouldn't be doing
any better.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.907
She'd be hyper-focused
on something stupid like...

16:48.994 --> 16:50.954
Like... like, "Why aren't
the wires connected

16:51.041 --> 16:52.592
to that security camera?"

16:52.679 --> 16:54.587
Yeah,
why aren't they connected?

16:54.674 --> 16:56.871
Wait.
She's onto something.

16:57.045 --> 16:58.376
The wires are cut.

16:58.463 --> 17:00.846
Why would someone cut the wires
to a security camera

17:00.933 --> 17:02.368
in a basement room?

17:02.455 --> 17:04.367
Well, Mitchell would have
some conspiracy theory

17:04.454 --> 17:06.560
that this is where the staff
does illicit behaviors.

17:06.647 --> 17:08.161
That's what it is.

17:08.521 --> 17:12.660
I have been smelling marijuana
since I got here!

17:16.506 --> 17:17.713
I got Gloria.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.618
My God,
she's like a DEA dog.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.098
That's where
it's coming from...

17:24.510 --> 17:28.150
Great. Now we have marijuana
and no lighter

17:28.237 --> 17:30.223
and just this stupid key.

17:30.432 --> 17:31.702
I can hear Jay saying,

17:31.789 --> 17:35.152
"Maybe that key
opens the door, dummy."

17:41.088 --> 17:43.168
They can never know how much
smarter they are than us.

17:43.255 --> 17:44.340
Never.

17:44.470 --> 17:45.987
- You got this, Becky.
- Mm-hmm.

17:46.197 --> 17:48.522
You walk in the cabin,
you push those buttons.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.775
They go beep,
boop, boop, boop.

17:51.086 --> 17:52.543
What are the numbers?

17:52.634 --> 17:54.066
3...
Uh-huh.

17:54.153 --> 17:55.483
3...
Yeah?

17:55.570 --> 17:56.483
Weeks!

17:56.570 --> 17:57.770
Since I've had my stroke,

17:57.857 --> 17:59.793
and this is the first time
you come and visit,

17:59.880 --> 18:02.647
and all you can care about
is that stupid cabin.

18:02.734 --> 18:05.389
Wait. No, what?
My brain is fine!

18:05.476 --> 18:07.837
- But the doctor...
- That's Fred from next door.

18:07.924 --> 18:09.650
He played a doctor
on a soap opera once,

18:09.737 --> 18:10.655
and he kept the coat.

18:10.742 --> 18:12.386
But it was
hockey playoffs.

18:12.498 --> 18:14.118
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

18:14.205 --> 18:16.067
Oh, Aunt Becky,
I'm so sorry.

18:16.154 --> 18:18.470
I just got off the phone with
the Prince of Liechtenstein.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.942
He's having some terrible
financial troubles.

18:21.029 --> 18:22.545
He's gonna need
the necklace back.

18:22.632 --> 18:24.503
You know,
to feed his people.

18:24.590 --> 18:25.729
Save it, princess.

18:25.816 --> 18:26.951
There's nothing wrong
with her memory.

18:27.038 --> 18:28.159
She was messing with us.

18:28.249 --> 18:29.286
Mean, huh?

18:29.373 --> 18:30.473
Horrible.

18:30.603 --> 18:31.780
That's my necklace.
Give it back.

18:31.867 --> 18:33.519
Not until you fix
the dent

18:33.606 --> 18:35.835
you put in my car
in high school...

18:35.922 --> 18:37.262
which is still there!

18:37.349 --> 18:38.698
You kept the Bonneville?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.090
That certainly doesn't
sound like a denial.

18:41.177 --> 18:42.659
I'm keeping the necklace.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.397
So you also know
about me too, then?

18:44.484 --> 18:45.512
What about you?

18:45.599 --> 18:46.623
Oh, God.
This is happening.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.759
Um, I-I, um...
I... so I...

18:48.846 --> 18:49.775
Spit it out.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.431
Uh, I'm not here
to take anything from you.

18:51.518 --> 18:52.756
I'm here to be
my true self.

18:52.843 --> 18:54.741
- Oh, for God's sake.
- And my true self is... Aunt Becky!

18:54.828 --> 18:57.646
I am... a lawyer.

18:57.733 --> 18:59.169
A lawyer?

18:59.315 --> 19:00.329
Ew.

19:00.475 --> 19:02.114
Well,
that's "ew" for two.

19:02.201 --> 19:03.189
How is she?

19:03.276 --> 19:05.020
Not good.
Full recovery.

19:06.377 --> 19:08.187
Dylan,
I'm sorry you got called.

19:08.274 --> 19:10.063
Well, maybe you didn't delete me
from your phone

19:10.150 --> 19:11.890
because you didn't delete me
from your heart.

19:11.977 --> 19:13.255
Or I just forgot.

19:13.342 --> 19:15.213
Right.
I'm married, Haley,

19:15.300 --> 19:17.346
and we're monotonous.
You got to move on.

19:17.433 --> 19:19.028
Ugh. I wish I was still
in my coma.

19:19.115 --> 19:20.523
She has a boyfriend.
Not me.

19:20.610 --> 19:21.552
I have a girlfriend.

19:21.639 --> 19:22.659
She's a Laker girl.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.704
Oh, barnacle scraper?
Hot.

19:24.791 --> 19:28.192
Miss Dunphy? This man also says
he's your boyfriend.

19:28.444 --> 19:29.897
What am I doing wrong?

19:29.984 --> 19:32.189
Haley. Are you okay?

19:32.276 --> 19:33.746
I've been so worried.

19:35.581 --> 19:36.843
Who's... Who's this?

19:36.930 --> 19:39.578
I'm the guy before you,
and he's the guy before me.

19:39.665 --> 19:40.815
Cheers.

19:40.924 --> 19:41.962
Um, Haley.

19:42.049 --> 19:43.446
We need to talk
about what happened.

19:43.533 --> 19:44.882
You screwed up.
That's what happened.

19:44.969 --> 19:46.259
Right. It's always us.

19:46.346 --> 19:48.189
We go halfsies
on a pot-bellied pig,

19:48.276 --> 19:50.532
and suddenly it's all mine
when it's frothing at the mouth

19:50.619 --> 19:52.287
and corners your mom
in the laundry room.

19:52.374 --> 19:54.181
Hey, he lied to his parents
about my job

19:54.268 --> 19:55.743
because he's ashamed
of me.

19:55.830 --> 19:58.865
Oh, no, no. No.
I'm not ashamed of you.

19:58.952 --> 20:00.171
I just panicked.

20:00.258 --> 20:02.615
Look, right after you left,
I told Mum the truth about you

20:02.702 --> 20:05.300
and your job and that if
I want to turn down a job

20:05.387 --> 20:06.704
to be with you,

20:06.847 --> 20:08.233
then that's my right.

20:08.353 --> 20:10.574
Well, it doesn't matter.
This isn't working out anyways.

20:10.661 --> 20:12.118
There it is.Totally.

20:12.205 --> 20:13.699
- What are they talking about?
- Ugh.

20:13.786 --> 20:15.300
They think
that I'm freaking out

20:15.387 --> 20:17.404
because you chose me
over that great job,

20:17.491 --> 20:18.943
which means that you have
big feelings for me,

20:19.030 --> 20:20.996
which forces me to look
at my feelings for you.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.194
And?

20:22.924 --> 20:23.949
And?

20:24.036 --> 20:25.080
And...

20:26.719 --> 20:28.236
I have big feelings,
too.

20:28.323 --> 20:30.446
- You do?
- Yes.

20:30.905 --> 20:32.168
- Say it.
- Shut up.

20:32.255 --> 20:33.237
I'll say it.

20:33.324 --> 20:35.821
Haley, I love you.

20:36.663 --> 20:38.368
I love you, too.

20:40.433 --> 20:42.210
I came as soon
as I got the call.

20:42.459 --> 20:43.721
Hey.

20:43.812 --> 20:45.023
What's her forecast?

20:52.461 --> 20:54.470
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:56.488 --> 20:58.499
- Did you get it?
- I gave her a hug goodbye,

20:58.586 --> 21:01.095
used my sleight-of-hand,
and on the third try...

21:02.257 --> 21:04.891
I feel so naughty
using my magic like that.

21:04.978 --> 21:06.413
I love you, baby.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.798
Your old boyfriends warned me
you were like this.

21:13.244 --> 21:14.598
Give me that necklace!

21:14.685 --> 21:16.702
She's coming.

21:16.789 --> 21:18.119
Give me that necklace!

21:18.206 --> 21:21.016
- Go, go, go!
- Watch what this bad boy can do.
