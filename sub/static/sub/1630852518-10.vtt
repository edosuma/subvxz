WEBVTT

00:26.526 --> 00:30.155
Now to rub my Tiny'mon
champion trainer's medal for good luck.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.491
Sometimes I feel you love that medal
more than me.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.453
No, it goes you,
Mom and Dad, my sisters,

00:36.536 --> 00:38.329
watching mean people
get what they deserve,

00:38.413 --> 00:39.831
then Tiny'mon medal.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.917
You know, I never got a medal,
and I've done a lot of--

00:43.001 --> 00:44.169
Yeah, great story.

00:44.252 --> 00:47.672
Now, let's beat the new
Tiny'mon Crash and Bash game!

00:47.756 --> 00:49.382
And its customizable menu

00:49.466 --> 00:52.093
means you can battle
with your Dukey'mon!

00:52.177 --> 00:54.721
And I'm selecting you
for the championship battle!

00:54.804 --> 00:56.806
Ooh, do I get a medal if I win?

00:56.890 --> 00:59.267
No. Now, time to take on…

00:59.350 --> 01:02.103
Mega Bon-Bon Mon!

01:02.187 --> 01:04.689
-And let the battle begi--

01:04.773 --> 01:05.982
Update required?

01:10.403 --> 01:12.530
Well, Tiny'mon should get medals.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.617
You trainers just stand there
while we do all the work, and--

01:17.577 --> 01:21.122
Yeah, that's not how it works.
Now, let's beat-beat Bon-Bon.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.666
-What the…?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.293
Password required?

01:25.376 --> 01:26.961
I don't have a password.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.214
-"Dukey 2005."

01:29.881 --> 01:31.841
-"I love farts."

01:31.925 --> 01:33.635
-"1-2-3-4-5."

01:34.636 --> 01:38.014
The update locked me
out of my own game?!

01:38.097 --> 01:40.600
Something's very, very wrong.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.396
We're only sending you
into Tiny'mon world

01:45.480 --> 01:48.066
because you went into
Wizard Lad world for us.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.150
Twice.

01:49.234 --> 01:53.071
May I remind you that Blast Ketchup
lives in Tiny'mon Land?

01:53.154 --> 01:54.322
And the last time you met,

01:54.405 --> 01:57.408
you destroyed Porkbelly
over a stupid medal.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.119
OK, that medal is not stupid,

01:59.202 --> 02:01.496
and that's why
you need to send Dukey with me

02:01.579 --> 02:02.956
in his Dukey'mon form.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.707
It's a virtual world, Johnny,

02:04.791 --> 02:07.210
so we can send him in
as any Tiny'mon you want.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.545
Can you send me in with a medal?

02:08.628 --> 02:09.838
Stop!

02:09.921 --> 02:13.758
And I can't destroy Porkbelly,
'cause I'm going there, not here,

02:13.842 --> 02:16.719
so… digitize us up, sisters!

02:25.186 --> 02:26.729
It's so colorful.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.108
And I'm so buff! Heh-heh.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.568
But too quiet.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.821
This place should be crawling
with my Tiny'mons.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.282
And what's with all the red dots?

02:38.241 --> 02:40.410
That are no longer dots!

02:42.162 --> 02:45.415
You got here faster than I expected,
Flame-Headed Boy,

02:45.498 --> 02:48.543
but I knew as soon as my update
stole your Tiny'mon,

02:48.626 --> 02:50.962
you would have your sisters
send you straight to me!

02:51.045 --> 02:52.839
Just give me the password, Blast,

02:52.922 --> 02:55.258
so I can unlock myself, go home,

02:55.341 --> 02:57.051
and not have to hear you blabber.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.553
But don't you see?

02:58.636 --> 03:01.472
This proves that I am
the true Tiny'mon master,

03:01.556 --> 03:03.975
and I will finally get back
my Champion Trainer medal

03:04.058 --> 03:07.395
you took from me,
thanks to this opening thing.

03:07.937 --> 03:12.025
Which is not big,
so Tiny'mon Battle-Cubes, now!

03:18.281 --> 03:20.867
We should have listened to
your sisters and not come here.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.285
Maybe.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.251
What is up?

03:30.335 --> 03:32.378
Your lab place is weird, yet cool.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.757
Quick! Try and pull Johnny out!

03:35.840 --> 03:37.592
-I can't!

03:37.675 --> 03:39.761
It's like he's locked
in the game or something.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.888
Because he is. And yes!

03:41.971 --> 03:44.098
I finally have
my Champion Medal back,

03:44.182 --> 03:48.019
which proves I am the greatest
Tiny'mon trainer of all time.

03:48.102 --> 03:51.189
No, it doesn't, because you didn't
win it back from Johnny.

03:51.272 --> 03:54.359
You stole it back,
which proves you're a jerk.

03:54.442 --> 03:58.154
Yeah, well, I have it,
so I am great! Right?

03:59.030 --> 04:03.743
Fine! Then I challenge him to
a quad battle championship battle.

04:03.826 --> 04:07.038
Tell him to bring four Earthy'mons
to Real World park,

04:07.121 --> 04:08.498
where we battled last.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.792
The password to unlock
your brother and dog

04:10.875 --> 04:15.004
is "Blast is the greatest
1-2-3 exclamation point!"

04:16.506 --> 04:20.718
Did we just start another Tiny'mon war
in Porkbelly?

04:22.011 --> 04:25.390
So… what's going on there,
Tiny'mon guy?

04:25.473 --> 04:27.517
I am waiting
for the Flame-Headed Boy

04:27.600 --> 04:29.978
to battle me
with four of your Earthy'mons.

04:30.061 --> 04:33.064
Then I will destroy him, and finally
win my Champion Medal back,

04:33.147 --> 04:34.857
'cause I did not steal it but win it.

04:34.941 --> 04:38.403
But you know that when you guys
try to destroy each other,

04:38.486 --> 04:40.863
a lot of other stuff gets destroyed?

04:40.947 --> 04:42.240
Fun, right?

04:42.323 --> 04:44.158
General, I know how to defeat him.

04:44.242 --> 04:48.204
Last time we used all your plutonium
to make Dukey a powerful Earthy'mon,

04:48.288 --> 04:49.872
and this time we'll do the same

04:49.956 --> 04:52.750
for Blaster Bear, Missile-iphant,
and Squirrel-Zooka.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.301
Swat that.

05:04.637 --> 05:09.058
Johnny, have you ever heard
of the military term "surrender?"

05:09.142 --> 05:11.644
"Give up?" "Throw in the chicken?"

05:11.728 --> 05:13.229
You want me to forfeit?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.107
Johnny, we all can't stand that guy,

05:16.190 --> 05:18.776
but even if we could defeat him
with these Earthy'mons…

05:18.860 --> 05:21.195
There will be enormous
destruction to this town

05:21.279 --> 05:22.697
over a small medal.

05:23.364 --> 05:24.741
Yeah, it's not that small.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.910
Johnny, look at the size of them!

05:30.663 --> 05:33.374
Look, here comes
the Flame-Headed Boy.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.959
Get ready for battle!

05:35.043 --> 05:36.377
You win, Blast.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.963
Are you throwing in the chicken?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.757
Your Tiny'mon are too strong,

05:40.840 --> 05:43.176
and I don't have the Earthy'mon
to defeat you.

05:43.259 --> 05:46.179
Ha-ha! Yes! The medal is mine!

05:47.472 --> 05:49.348
Come on, little guy.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.768
I hate surrendering.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.520
But we're very proud of you.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.440
How can you be proud
of someone who has lost?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.358
Oh, but you must be used to it,

05:59.442 --> 06:01.736
being from this pathetic
real-world place

06:01.819 --> 06:03.196
full of weak creatures.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.824
And this medal proves
I am superior to all of you,

06:06.908 --> 06:09.077
and this place smells bad,
did you know that?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.578
Oh, and another thing…

06:10.661 --> 06:14.582
This medal feels good, very good,
but not for you,

06:14.665 --> 06:17.335
because you no longer
are the best trainer. Ha-ha!

06:17.418 --> 06:19.337
Are you done?

06:19.420 --> 06:21.714
Almost, because it is time
to laugh at you.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.261
Man, I can't stand that kid.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.723
And, Johnny, surrender
does not mean defeat.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.893
It means you know
you were overmatched,

06:33.976 --> 06:36.312
and that you'll try again.

06:36.395 --> 06:40.149
But don't because, once again,
you'll destroy the town.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.901
What if I tried again somewhere else?

06:41.984 --> 06:45.738
What if we took the Earthy'mon
to Tiny'mon Land?

06:45.822 --> 06:46.906
Hmm…

06:46.989 --> 06:51.702
-We could crush Blast…
-Without crushing Porkbelly.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.539
Yeah, it's the General.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.208
I need to borrow
some things from the zoo.

06:58.084 --> 07:02.088
I present to you
the reassembled Earthy'mon!

07:03.798 --> 07:07.510
The Missile-iphant,
Blaster Bear, and, of course…

07:08.970 --> 07:10.513
-No!

07:10.596 --> 07:12.181
-Squirrel-Zooka!

07:12.265 --> 07:13.683
It's a good start,

07:13.766 --> 07:17.353
but we're going up against
highly evolved Tiny'mon.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.064
Which means we need
to imagine and digitize

07:20.148 --> 07:22.692
new and more powerful evolved forms.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.444
Like we did with Dukey!

07:24.527 --> 07:26.779
And I was very powerful.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.198
Like "win a medal" powerful?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.992
Only the trainers get medals.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.952
Well, that seems very unfair!

07:33.035 --> 07:37.331
Ha-ha-ha! I can just imagine
the Flame-Headed Boy right now.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.208
Oh, how I wish I could see his face

07:39.292 --> 07:40.960
that is probably crying like this,

07:41.043 --> 07:44.130
"Boo-hoo-hoo. Boo-hoo-hoo.
Wah, wah, wah."

07:44.213 --> 07:47.008
What is it? I was not done
being very funny.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.638
Hey, Blast!
I came to win my medal back.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.184
And we came to see you lose it.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.436
And just how do you plan
on doing that?

07:59.187 --> 08:01.814
With this. Earthy'mon, go!

08:04.650 --> 08:07.320
-You cannot be serious.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.654
Hold on a second.

08:22.460 --> 08:26.464
Huh. I guess the upgrade
didn't work on the squirrel.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.133
I recommend
you save that one for last,

08:29.217 --> 08:32.678
and Baboomer, Thwack Attack now!

08:32.762 --> 08:35.431
Missile-iphant… Titan Trunk!

08:39.936 --> 08:44.398
Not bad, but Kadoomerang, Doomerang!

08:52.406 --> 08:53.282
Uh-oh.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.621
How do you like Earthy'mon now, Blast?

08:58.704 --> 09:01.207
You may be winning, but not for long!

09:01.290 --> 09:03.501
Badias, Electro-attack!

09:07.338 --> 09:09.715
Yes! It's a double knockout!

09:09.799 --> 09:12.802
And we have Blast, two against one.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.639
Sorta.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.182
I got this one, Johnny,

09:18.266 --> 09:22.687
because I know Mega-Bon-Bon
can't beat my Toxic Tail!

09:28.693 --> 09:30.903
Am I winning?

09:30.987 --> 09:33.656
Your Earthy'mon
aren't the only creatures evolved.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.491
I prepared for your toxic attack.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.619
Mega-Mega Bon-Bon Blast now!

09:41.581 --> 09:44.500
Don't make me ever
play this game again.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.130
Ha-ha! You have finally run out of luck,
Flame-Headed Boy.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.715
But, uh, I haven't…

09:52.216 --> 09:53.467
…run out of Earthy'mon!

10:00.349 --> 10:03.060
Your world and Earthy'mons
are no match for me.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.896
It is time for all of you
to admit my superiority,

10:05.980 --> 10:07.898
and maybe even shed a tear,

10:07.982 --> 10:10.318
because I have won,
and you have lost.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.028
Capital "L" for Loser,

10:12.111 --> 10:13.487
on the forehead, in an L-shape…

10:13.571 --> 10:16.782
Is he ever going to stop?

10:16.866 --> 10:20.202
Now, take one last look
at the medal you no longer have,

10:20.286 --> 10:21.579
Flame-Headed Boy,

10:21.662 --> 10:23.122
because I have it,

10:23.205 --> 10:27.209
and take all your weak Earthy'mon
to your dumb planet place.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.673
Huh. I guess it<i> does</i> work on squirrels.

10:34.508 --> 10:35.593
Oh, crud.

10:41.057 --> 10:44.810
You see that, Blast?
Don't mess with Earthy'mons!

10:44.894 --> 10:49.023
No-o-o-o-o-o!

10:50.232 --> 10:54.945
In recognition of winning
my favorite battle of all time,

10:55.029 --> 10:58.324
even though it was
inside of a computer thingie,

10:58.407 --> 11:03.371
I present to you the Medal of Honor
for kickin' Blast's butt!

11:10.127 --> 11:12.588
Well done, Dog!

11:12.672 --> 11:15.466
Yes. I got a medal!

11:16.967 --> 11:18.552
How's he doing that?

11:18.636 --> 11:19.720
I don't know.
