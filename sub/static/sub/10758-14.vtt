00:10.018 --> 00:11.645
FranÃ§ois, it's Niles Crane.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.439
You delivered some champagne earlier
for Valentine's Day.

00:14.606 --> 00:18.360
Well, you brought over the '88,
and I asked for the '85.

00:18.568 --> 00:20.237
Yes, my date
will know the difference.

00:20.445 --> 00:22.822
She happens to be the president
of our wine club.

00:23.031 --> 00:24.574
Thank you. Thank you.

00:24.741 --> 00:26.952
Yes. Remember, I won't be at home.

00:27.202 --> 00:28.912
No, I'm not entertaining
at the Shangri-la.

00:29.079 --> 00:31.289
My brother was kind enough
to let me use his apartment.

00:31.456 --> 00:34.668
Well, what could I do?
I threw a blanket over it.

00:35.043 --> 00:39.089
All right, now hurry, please,
this woman is very particular.

00:40.757 --> 00:42.550
Lucky for you, she loves dogs.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.225 --> 02:16.477
Oh, yeah.

02:35.537 --> 02:37.289
There we go.

02:44.087 --> 02:46.131
All right, all right.

03:02.105 --> 03:03.732
Hey!

03:11.907 --> 03:12.908
Hey, hey, hey!

03:32.886 --> 03:35.555
Oh, dear, oh.

07:16.816 --> 07:19.027
<i>- Hello?
- Roz, it's Frasier.</i>

07:19.235 --> 07:20.236
<i>Listen, I need your help.</i>

07:20.445 --> 07:22.321
Well, I don't have much time.
I'm on my way out.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.450
Just answer me this.
How do you know if you're on a date?

07:25.658 --> 07:26.993
<i>- Are you alone?
- Yes.</i>

07:27.160 --> 07:28.619
Then you're not on a date.

07:30.121 --> 07:31.122
That's very funny.

07:31.372 --> 07:33.583
<i>Listen, I'm in a restaurant waiting
for Cassandra Stone,</i>

07:33.791 --> 07:34.959
<i>our new publicity director.</i>

07:35.209 --> 07:37.920
She asked me out for dinner
this evening, and I was very flattered.

07:38.087 --> 07:39.338
I think she's a terrific woman.

07:39.547 --> 07:41.007
It's just, I'm starting to wonder

07:41.174 --> 07:45.219
if this is a business dinner
or more of a romantic date.

07:45.428 --> 07:47.388
You're going out to dinner
on Valentine's Day.

07:47.555 --> 07:48.723
It sounds like a date to me.

07:48.973 --> 07:51.851
Yes, well, she didn't know it was
Valentine's Day until I reminded her,

07:52.018 --> 07:54.478
and she did say she wanted
to go over a new ad campaign.

07:54.687 --> 07:55.688
Oh, come on.

07:55.896 --> 07:58.274
Every time I see you two,
she's got her hands all over you.

07:58.482 --> 07:59.984
She has her hands
all over everybody.

08:00.151 --> 08:01.652
- She's a big flirt.
- That's true.

08:01.861 --> 08:03.738
She flirted with me
the first time I met her

08:03.904 --> 08:06.282
until I took off
my baseball cap and parka.

08:07.491 --> 08:09.160
<i>Why don't you just ask her
if it's a date?</i>

08:09.326 --> 08:12.746
Oh, Roz, I can't do that.
What if the answer is no?

08:12.955 --> 08:15.875
<i>For God's sakes, it'll be awkward
all through dinner, awkward at work.</i>

08:16.083 --> 08:18.460
Imagine how embarrassing
if it gets around the station.

08:18.711 --> 08:20.462
I guess you're gonna have
to play it by ear.

08:20.629 --> 08:23.007
You'll know what she has in mind
by the way she's dressed,

08:23.215 --> 08:25.134
how she acts, how she treats you.

08:25.342 --> 08:26.844
Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right.

08:27.511 --> 08:29.972
- Oh, there's my date.
- Who are you going out with tonight?

08:30.222 --> 08:32.265
Oh, Bob, you know,
the tax accountant.

08:32.474 --> 08:34.309
Isn't he the one who drones on
so incessantly,

08:34.476 --> 08:35.644
you call him "The Cricket?"

08:35.852 --> 08:37.354
No, I call him "The Cricket"

08:37.520 --> 08:40.857
because he rubs his hands together
really fast during sex.

08:41.066 --> 08:43.693
<i>- Bye.
- Goodbye.</i>

08:50.200 --> 08:52.494
- Cassandra.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

08:52.703 --> 08:55.956
Oh, well, that's all right. I was just
wondering if you'd changed your mind.

08:56.123 --> 08:58.333
What, and pass up dinner
with the sexiest man in radio?

09:00.294 --> 09:02.254
Oh, well.

09:03.338 --> 09:06.216
I, you know... It's just so...
Our plans were so last-minute,

09:06.383 --> 09:08.593
I thought, you know,
maybe I'd misunderstood.

09:10.512 --> 09:14.516
My, things have certainly
been clarified, haven't they?

09:15.559 --> 09:17.519
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Of course.

09:18.145 --> 09:20.272
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.524
See that woman over there
by the coat check?

09:22.732 --> 09:24.568
- Yes.
- Yes, she's my dinner companion.

09:24.734 --> 09:27.362
See, and things have taken a turn
toward the romantic.

09:27.571 --> 09:31.158
See, now, I want to make her feel
as special as possible.

09:31.366 --> 09:34.160
Then you should have offered
to check her coat.

09:34.369 --> 09:35.871
Yes, thank you very much. All right.

09:36.037 --> 09:38.039
Just play something romantic
when she comes back.

09:38.206 --> 09:41.459
Miss Cassandra,
so nice to see you again.

09:41.668 --> 09:42.836
You too, Mario.

09:43.044 --> 09:46.298
And how's the sexiest maitre d'
in Seattle?

09:51.970 --> 09:55.640
Sorry again for keeping you waiting.
I got sucked in at this cocktail party.

09:55.807 --> 09:57.350
Oh, you were at a cocktail party.

09:57.517 --> 09:59.727
Some benefit thing.
It was very fancy.

09:59.936 --> 10:01.980
Obviously. Why else
would I show up wearing this?

10:02.188 --> 10:04.566
Why else indeed?

10:08.903 --> 10:11.447
Oh, they have
the best wine list here.

10:12.407 --> 10:14.117
Do you feel like sharing a bottle?

10:14.325 --> 10:15.577
If you like.

10:15.827 --> 10:18.121
Good thing I took a cab here.
I'm a real lightweight.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.623
Then again,
I'm sure a gentleman like you

10:20.790 --> 10:23.626
wouldn't mind escorting me back
to my room after dinner, will you?

10:24.168 --> 10:26.295
Why, I think that could be arranged.

10:30.258 --> 10:32.802
- I love the food here.
- What do you recommend?

10:33.052 --> 10:35.680
I'll start with the anchovies
and red peppers,

10:35.847 --> 10:39.267
and then the garlic chicken
with scallions.

10:45.022 --> 10:46.941
Are you in the mood for oysters?

10:48.985 --> 10:51.279
Actually, I'm not sure.

10:55.741 --> 10:58.577
Well, here we are.

10:58.744 --> 11:00.788
Your hotel room.

11:00.955 --> 11:03.165
Last stop.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.960
Oh, come on in.

11:07.169 --> 11:09.922
- Oh, thank you so much for this coat.
- Of course.

11:10.131 --> 11:12.800
Oh, God, I can't believe
we got caught in that rain storm.

11:12.967 --> 11:15.970
- I'm freezing.
- Yes, me too.

11:16.178 --> 11:18.139
I know something we can do
to warm up really fast.

11:18.347 --> 11:20.099
Yes, all we have to do is...

11:20.307 --> 11:22.059
- Have a brandy.
- Yes! Let's have a brandy.

11:22.226 --> 11:24.103
- The mini-bar's right over there.
- Oh, great.

11:24.270 --> 11:26.480
I'll be right out.

11:33.445 --> 11:35.572
<i>- Hello?
- Roz, it's Frasier.</i>

11:35.781 --> 11:37.908
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm in Cassandra's hotel room.</i>

11:38.158 --> 11:41.036
She invited me up here after dinner.
I'm just not sure what that means.

11:41.203 --> 11:42.204
<i>What it means?</i>

11:42.413 --> 11:45.666
<i>It means even a blind pig
finds an acorn once in a while.</i>

11:48.419 --> 11:50.295
I'm still getting a lot
of conflicting signals.

11:50.462 --> 11:53.006
Maybe she just wants me up here
to talk about business.

11:53.298 --> 11:56.969
I just wish I could get one clear,
unambiguous sign.

11:57.845 --> 12:00.973
Oh, I just had to get out
of that dress.

12:01.139 --> 12:04.226
Here's your brandy.

12:11.733 --> 12:13.527
I'll just go dry my hair.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.197
Roz, I'm back.

12:19.366 --> 12:21.993
Okay, she ditched her dress,
and she's hitting the sauce.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.080
What do you need,
runway lights on the mattress?

12:27.249 --> 12:29.918
Roz, it's not as clear-cut
as it seems.

12:30.085 --> 12:32.921
<i>Look, Frasier,
she is way out on a limb here.</i>

12:33.130 --> 12:35.674
You know how rejected she's gonna
feel if you don't make a move?

12:35.882 --> 12:38.093
<i>- You're gonna blow it forever.
- Right.</i>

12:38.301 --> 12:40.512
You know what?
I'll take off my jacket.

12:40.762 --> 12:42.722
Yeah, go get them, cowboy.

12:44.307 --> 12:45.392
Frasier?

12:46.017 --> 12:47.686
Are you making yourself
comfortable?

12:48.728 --> 12:49.896
Yes.

12:50.146 --> 12:51.815
If it's okay,
I still have a few questions

12:51.982 --> 12:54.985
about the ad campaign
I'd like to ask you.

12:55.151 --> 12:57.987
Well, that's why I'm here.

12:58.154 --> 13:02.534
Or if you prefer, we could just talk
about it over breakfast tomorrow.

13:05.203 --> 13:06.788
Breakfast, you say?

13:06.996 --> 13:08.498
I hope I wasn't
being presumptuous.

13:08.665 --> 13:10.542
We will be having breakfast
together, won't we?

13:10.708 --> 13:12.377
Absolutely.

13:12.544 --> 13:14.754
Great.
So who else is gonna be there?

13:14.921 --> 13:16.172
Where?

13:16.339 --> 13:17.340
At the breakfast meeting.

13:17.549 --> 13:19.592
The one for the sponsors here
at the hotel tomorrow.

13:19.801 --> 13:21.761
You just said you were going, right?

13:21.970 --> 13:24.889
The meeting. Of course.

13:26.724 --> 13:28.601
Frasier.

13:29.352 --> 13:30.937
What are you doing?

13:31.396 --> 13:33.523
Well, I...

13:34.107 --> 13:36.484
I thought you said you were
gonna make yourself comfortable.

13:37.735 --> 13:38.986
Why don't you check the closet?

13:39.153 --> 13:41.364
I'm sure you'll find something
in there you can slip on.

13:41.572 --> 13:44.492
- All right.
- I'm just gonna take my lenses out.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.914
You know, I'm really glad
I asked you to dinner.

13:50.164 --> 13:51.999
Gosh, so am I.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.251
You may not believe this,

13:53.417 --> 13:55.628
but I almost chickened out
at the last minute.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.631
It just goes to show,
it's always better to take the risk.

13:58.839 --> 13:59.840
Yes.

14:00.049 --> 14:03.386
I mean, so you say no. I'm an adult.
What's a little embarrassment?

14:03.594 --> 14:05.388
I couldn't agree more.

14:06.055 --> 14:08.516
Did you find the slippers?

14:13.521 --> 14:14.522
What?

14:14.730 --> 14:16.941
In the closet. You stepped in
that puddle after dinner.

14:17.108 --> 14:20.945
I figured you might want to get out
of those wet shoes and socks.

14:21.112 --> 14:22.113
I mean, it's up to you.

14:22.321 --> 14:24.782
I know some people feel funny
about taking their shoes off

14:24.949 --> 14:27.409
in someone else's room.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.956
My gosh, it's really starting
to come down out there.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.333
You know what I'm thinking?

14:34.500 --> 14:37.544
No, I truly don't.

14:40.297 --> 14:43.258
Well, it doesn't make much sense
for you to drive home in this weather,

14:43.425 --> 14:46.345
especially since you are coming back
for breakfast anyway.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.348
Why don't you just
stay over tonight?

14:49.515 --> 14:51.642
All right.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.729
When you say "stay over,"
you mean, of course...

14:56.730 --> 14:58.065
Stay here.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.987
Here? Right. Splendid.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.951
- Oh, my God!
- What? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:09.535 --> 15:12.371
I just can't believe it's so late.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.581
What are you sorry for?

15:14.790 --> 15:18.210
Oh, just for keeping you up so late.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.088
Oh, that's all right.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.548
Aren't you coming to bed?

15:23.965 --> 15:26.343
Oh, yes. Coming to bed, yes.

15:26.551 --> 15:30.389
Coming to this bed.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.308
Well, would you mind
turning the lights out?

15:33.475 --> 15:35.936
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.821
You know, Cassandra, I know
this may sound like a silly question

15:46.988 --> 15:53.745
seeing as how we're in bed together,
and nearly naked.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.666
I've just been wondering,

15:57.832 --> 16:05.215
is this a romantic date
or a business thing?

16:13.723 --> 16:15.683
Cassandra?

16:16.059 --> 16:18.019
Cassandra.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.319
Roz, it's Frasier.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.204
You know, Daph,
I'm really impressed with you.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.164
A lot of people get all insecure

16:38.331 --> 16:40.625
if they don't have a date
on Valentine's Day, but not you.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.377
Oh, heavens, no.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.712
If you think about it,
it's just a silly holiday

16:44.921 --> 16:47.048
they made up to sell
more flowers and candy.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.257
Right.

16:48.466 --> 16:51.010
Well, you take a look at the menu,
and I'll check your coat.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.678
Oh, there's no need for that.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.472
So, what looks good to you?

16:54.639 --> 16:56.349
The coat check girl.
Give me your coat.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.020
Happy Valentine's Day.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.980
- Welcome to Russano's.
- Thank you.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.982
The waiter will be by
to take your drink order

17:05.148 --> 17:06.317
when your husband gets back.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.612
Oh, he's not my husband.
I don't have a...

17:10.363 --> 17:12.448
...husband.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.788
Wow, I wish there was something else
I could check.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.248
Besides my blood pressure.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.834
Well, I know what I'm in the mood for.

17:24.042 --> 17:27.463
A nice big steak. How about you?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.257
What happened?

17:30.424 --> 17:34.261
Well, look around you.
Nothing but couples in love.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.430
That's never gonna be me.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.974
I'm just gonna wind up
a dried-up old maid

17:39.141 --> 17:43.729
in a quilted bath robe
with a smelly, deaf cat on my lap.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.940
I thought you said
you're okay with that.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.233
- What?
- All right, Daph. Come on, now.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.986
Now, don't get upset. Here,
have a drink of water or something.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.614
- Oh, I'm sorry about this.
- That's okay.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.616
I don't know what came over me.

17:55.783 --> 17:59.286
I haven't cried like this since,
well, New Year's Eve.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.622
Oh, jeez, come on, Daph.

18:01.830 --> 18:05.417
You're, you know,
you're gonna find someone.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.127
- You think so?
- Well, sure.

18:07.294 --> 18:12.257
Yeah, you're...
You have a lot of very great qualities.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.928
Thank you.
I'm so sorry about this.

18:16.094 --> 18:19.097
I know it makes you uncomfortable
to talk about personal things.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.725
Yeah, well, that's all right.
So you ready to order?

18:21.892 --> 18:23.852
Oh, yeah.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.523
What kind of qualities?

18:28.982 --> 18:34.196
Well, you know, you're smart
and nice-Iooking and fun to be with.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.364
So you gonna go
with the soup or salad?

18:36.531 --> 18:39.326
- You really think I'm nice-Iooking?
- Well, sure, yeah.

18:40.368 --> 18:43.038
Where's that guy with the bread?

18:43.663 --> 18:44.915
That is so sweet of you.

18:45.123 --> 18:48.376
Well, don't mention it.
Let's just have a nice, happy evening.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.796
Of course. I'm fine now.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.053
- Nice-Iooking how?
- Oh, jeez.

18:58.219 --> 19:01.306
- Oh, never mind.
- Oh, no, it's all right.

19:01.514 --> 19:06.061
Well, you know,
you're pretty and tall.

19:06.269 --> 19:09.773
And you take good care of your hair.

19:09.981 --> 19:12.108
You know, you're attractive.
What do you want from me?

19:12.358 --> 19:15.278
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't hear
this sort of thing very much lately.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.906
Well, you're just in a slump,
that's all.

19:18.114 --> 19:20.825
You ask me, you're a great catch.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.870
It's not my place to say so, miss,
but I think your father's right.

19:24.078 --> 19:26.289
You're a very attractive woman.

19:29.959 --> 19:33.212
Well, how about that?

19:33.463 --> 19:36.716
- That's a nice little ego boost.
- Yeah.

19:38.051 --> 19:42.180
Oh, I feel so silly all of a sudden,
getting upset out of nowhere like that.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.015
Well, I feel better now.

19:44.182 --> 19:47.935
- Ready to share a nice big steak?
- Yeah, fine, whatever.

19:49.437 --> 19:50.688
What's wrong with you?

19:50.938 --> 19:52.356
Why did he assume
I was your father?

19:52.523 --> 19:54.984
I mean, a lot of guys my age
go out with women like you.

19:55.151 --> 19:56.152
What's he trying to say,

19:56.360 --> 19:58.488
that I can never attract
someone young and pretty?

19:58.696 --> 20:00.031
Well, thank you, Mr. Crane.

20:00.239 --> 20:03.409
- Does this all have to be about you?
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.

20:03.910 --> 20:06.829
Well, you're a very attractive man
with lots of wonderful qualities.

20:06.996 --> 20:10.833
Yeah, yeah, I know.
All right, let's order.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.423
Like what?

20:17.590 --> 20:19.634
Oh, come on, now.

20:19.842 --> 20:23.429
You're very charming,
and you have a good sense of humour.

20:23.637 --> 20:25.765
And you've got lovely eyes.

20:25.973 --> 20:28.267
But most of all,
you're good company.

20:28.434 --> 20:30.144
I enjoy living with you.

20:30.644 --> 20:32.938
Well, thank you, Daphne.
I like living with you too.

20:33.189 --> 20:35.065
Thank you.

20:38.611 --> 20:39.987
So why do you like living with me?

20:40.154 --> 20:43.157
Oh, for God's sake!
Didn't we just agree to cut this out?

20:43.324 --> 20:47.661
Oh, all right, all right.
You're wonderful. I'm wonderful.

20:47.828 --> 20:50.122
You know, it's funny
when I think about the two of us.

20:50.331 --> 20:52.166
I mean, sure,
we have our little fights,

20:52.333 --> 20:55.836
but for the most part,
we get along so well together.

20:56.003 --> 20:59.506
And when I think about
how I enjoy looking after you

20:59.757 --> 21:03.427
and how you always seem to miss me
when I've been gone for too long,

21:03.677 --> 21:05.763
well, it's sort of like you're my...

21:06.805 --> 21:07.890
What?

21:08.140 --> 21:11.185
- No, it might sound funny to say it.
- Now, come on.

21:11.393 --> 21:13.395
That's all right. You can say it.

21:14.813 --> 21:16.398
All right.

21:16.565 --> 21:19.443
Well, it's sort of like you're my pet.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.238
What?

21:23.447 --> 21:25.908
Well, in a good sense.
Like you and Eddie.

21:26.158 --> 21:28.285
What are you talking about?
Are you calling me a dog?

21:28.493 --> 21:29.995
- It's an analogy!
- I can't believe it.

21:30.203 --> 21:33.206
I take you out to buy you a nice meal,
and you call me a dog!

21:33.415 --> 21:35.542
- I give you a bath.
- I wish I ate as well as Eddie,

21:35.751 --> 21:38.628
I'll tell you that,
instead of the slop you give me.
