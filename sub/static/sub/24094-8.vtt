00:34.785 --> 00:36.637
Hey, visiting hours haven't started yet.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.263
It's okay. He can stay.

00:40.457 --> 00:44.186
Someday I hope I'm lucky enough
to have someone like you by my side.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.446
All right, asshole, spill it.
Tell me what this key opens.

00:56.557 --> 01:01.578
You know, Julio's been talking to me
from the grave, and it ain't pretty.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.373
Now wake up and get to talking, bitch!

01:12.281 --> 01:14.615
Latrelle's roll-up on Cesar
is all over IG.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.868
I'm really stressed. We've barely
talked in the last two days.

01:17.869 --> 01:20.204
With all the Santos at his crib,
it's like a safe house.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.623
As long as he lays low
and doesn't show, he's all good.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.875
- I am all good.
- What are you doing here?

01:24.876 --> 01:27.461
- Yeah, you shouldn't be here.
- I have a math test.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.046
Cesar, you have a green light on you.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.191
I'm Spooky's brother.
I have a green light every day.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.843
- If something happens to you...
- I'm fine.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.345
I'm gonna be in and out.
Just here for the test, okay?

01:36.346 --> 01:38.222
So don't worry, worry about your quince.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.950
Your dress is coming today, right?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.077
Trust me, I'll be good.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.898
I need a favor.
Take Olivia's mind off me today.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.418
Get her to focus on her quince.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.652
- We can do that.
- Go straight home after school.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.570
The block is hot

01:52.571 --> 01:54.405
- and I need you to stay safe.
- But what about you?

01:54.406 --> 01:56.606
How do we make sure you're safe?

01:57.784 --> 01:59.869
Uh, I got to go. Shit.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.638
Tell Ms. Blanchard I'm
sick or something.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.806
- You don't need to say it...
- I'm gonna say it.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.047
What's wrong with you?
You can't be out here in the open.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.353
I'm sorry, but I had a math test.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.998
- This teacher will fail my ass...
- Goddamn math test?!

02:30.442 --> 02:32.836
I told you to stay at the crib.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.697
Use your head,
before someone puts a bullet in it.

02:36.698 --> 02:37.841
I'm sorry, all right?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.510
It sucks being stuck.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.430
Just don't be so stupid.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.353
So what should we do
about the situation?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.027
I say we have some fun, Lil' Spooky.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.821
I know Cesar doesn't want me to worry,
but I can't help it.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.674
You don't have to rationalize it.
Getting rolled up on is no joke.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.347
Cesar said you were there with him.
What exactly happened?

03:27.374 --> 03:29.476
Monse, I can't stop thinking about you.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.252
About us.

03:31.753 --> 03:35.131
- I don't want to think about it.
- Shouldn't we do something? It's Cesar!

03:36.049 --> 03:39.110
Hey, hey, no more Cesar talk.
My boy can handle himself.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.847
Olivia, imagine everyone
is quietly waiting for you,

03:42.848 --> 03:45.242
and then suddenly, you appear...

03:46.059 --> 03:47.059
in this.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.144
Oh.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.311
I mean...

03:49.312 --> 03:51.706
Oh! It's so...

03:53.734 --> 03:55.735
Forget it. I can't even fake it.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.361
- What am I gonna do?
- Nothing.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.672
You will do nothing.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.531
- I will fix this, princesa.
- How?

04:00.532 --> 04:02.783
There's no time. And we don't have money
to get anything new.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.076
This is such bad luck.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.788
However, it's lucky that we're
such positive, resourceful people

04:07.789 --> 04:09.832
who can find a solution to any problem.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.060
I don't think so. This
is a real disaster.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.628
I'm trying to help.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.939
Go help in my bedroom.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.469
I'm sorry.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.387
It'll be okay. Maybe.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.531
Go.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.035
Don't worry. I got this.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.497
- Talk to me. Is he awake?
- No.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.041
Dude's still down,
but I think he's recovering.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.376
I was singing "Beat It"
and his toes were twitching.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.503
Why are you singing?

04:55.504 --> 04:58.172
Studies show it's the second-best way
to wake someone from a coma.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.853
- What's the first?
- You don't wanna know.

05:00.258 --> 05:03.177
So, get this, the nurses gave me
Chivo's personal belongings.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.054
Jamal, I don't wanna hear
about what kind of underwear...

05:05.055 --> 05:07.014
Unfortunately, he
doesn't wear underwear.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.768
- But I have the keys to his nursery.
- Why did they give you his stuff?

05:10.769 --> 05:14.146
I told the nurses that I was his nephew
and they believed me.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.731
I now understand how babies get swapped.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.316
What time should I meet you
at the nursery?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.234
Um...

05:18.235 --> 05:20.337
Four hours from... never!

05:20.612 --> 05:23.656
Your anxiety on top of my anxiety
is a heart attack waiting to happen.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.075
- I'm not anxious.
- Says the Great Irritator.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.159
- I'm gonna go now.
- Good.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.387
Do that and please keep yourself busy.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.323
I'll let you know what I find out
as soon as I find it.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.548
Ma'am, I'm not getting anywhere with
you. I need to speak with your manager.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.093
Yes, I realize
you're a small business, but...

06:09.244 --> 06:11.596
Oh. Then can I speak to your mom?

06:12.914 --> 06:14.557
Hello? Hello?

06:16.543 --> 06:20.063
I don't think I'm doing anyone around
here any good, so I'm gonna bounce.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.715
- That's really mature of you.
- Thank you.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.009
And don't worry, Olivia,
you're gonna be fine.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.570
And so is the other person
who I can't mention.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.931
He's gonna be fine.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.851
We don't need to worry about Cesar. What
we need to worry about is your dress.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.854
Lucky for you,
we have 48 hours and I'm a fixer.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.916
And a good fixer
always knows a better fixer.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.377
The material is meh.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.030
And the stitching, clearly a novice.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.949
Me? I would've used organza.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.868
Not that satin or taffeta.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.722
And with your shape,
strapless is obvious.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.748
- You're a four, right?
- Mm-hmm.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.459
But what do I know?

06:58.460 --> 07:02.296
I'm just a seamstress who's only made
a mere thousand dresses.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.377
- That sounds perfect.
- Ah.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.049
So you'll fix it?

07:05.050 --> 07:07.092
- No.
- No?

07:07.093 --> 07:10.321
You live with a woman who makes dresses,

07:10.931 --> 07:13.658
and still you order one
from this Etsy vieja?

07:14.267 --> 07:18.771
I'm no... How do you say? Side piece.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.772
Hmm.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.028
Eleven miles.

07:26.029 --> 07:29.531
Might as well be 11 million. I can't
believe I never come to the beach.

07:29.532 --> 07:33.553
I was out here three months ago.
The night I got out of Corcoran.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.891
After four years in a six by eight,
I needed to see something big.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.226
Open.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.906
Still don't like onions?

07:55.850 --> 07:57.077
Ever tried a shallot?

07:58.103 --> 07:59.204
What's a shallot?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.247
And you're supposed to be the smart one.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.961
A shallot, my genius brother,

08:07.487 --> 08:08.838
is a type of onion.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.133
A botanical variety of the species
Allium cepa.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.659
Who are you?

08:13.660 --> 08:16.100
Spelling bee champ, seventh and
eighth grade. That's who I am.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.956
Shit, if I wasn't
looking after your ass,

08:18.957 --> 08:20.874
I would've hit
that magnet school up in Pasadena.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.353
- Now you're just messing with me.
- De veras, homes.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.671
All my teachers wrote letters for me.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.773
Even the principal.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.733
Told mom I was gifted.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.569
- So why didn't you go?
- And leave your little ass alone?

08:32.636 --> 08:33.822
But Mom was around.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.784
No, that wouldn't have been a good idea.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.620
- What do you mean?
- Don't worry about it.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.706
I'm not a kid anymore.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.254
Mom wasn't always around.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.174
When she was around...

08:53.658 --> 08:54.968
she wasn't really around.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.583
I never knew that.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.685
Good.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.520
Then I did my job.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.529
I had plans to ace that magnet school,
then go to culinary school.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.181
My brother, the chef.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.062
Hey, you joke,
but that shit could've been real.

09:22.353 --> 09:26.541
Okay, so use shallot in a sentence.

09:28.151 --> 09:31.153
Give me all your shallots, biatch.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.699
Guys, say hi to Laura.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.617
Hi!

09:36.618 --> 09:37.886
Hi.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.122
That was Cooper and Hayden.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.625
Feel free to entice them
away from their screens if you can.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.335
If you can't, don't worry about it.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.496
Just hang out and make sure
they don't kill each other.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.381
Kitchen's over there.
Help yourself to anything.

09:51.382 --> 09:55.010
I will be down the hall in my office
should there be any emergencies.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.011
- You got it.
- Thanks.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.306
I'm ...just trying to make a
deadline and I even barely even started.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.849
Procrastinating is my hobby.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.535
Me too. What are you writing?

10:03.019 --> 10:05.622
It's a novel slash memoir.

10:06.231 --> 10:10.359
Some super personal stuff that I find
hard to talk about let alone write.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.362
I've been writing it for years
and I thought maybe moving back to LA

10:13.363 --> 10:14.863
would help motivate me to finish, but...

10:14.864 --> 10:16.323
Where did you move from?

10:16.324 --> 10:18.700
New York.
Yeah, where are you from, Laura?

10:18.701 --> 10:21.137
- Freeridge.
- Freeridge? Get out of here.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.474
- Are you from Freeridge?
- No, but my neighbor Rosé is.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.726
Is that where you know me from?

10:27.585 --> 10:30.087
Yeah. We met once at
her Halloween party.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.088
We did?

10:31.548 --> 10:33.006
I'm sorry, I don't remember that.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.093
But I... As a mother of two,
I'm a little scatterbrained.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.154
You didn't tell me
where you're from. Where in LA?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.157
- Not too far from here.
- Where?

10:41.724 --> 10:44.685
You know, west side.
I should probably get back to work.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.246
Make yourself at home, okay?

10:47.730 --> 10:49.165
I can get used to this.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.918
Good,
'cause I'm gonna move here someday.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.338
I'm serious.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.739
What? Are you gonna be
one of those crazy homeless dudes

10:57.740 --> 11:01.076
at the Venice drum circle
with dreads and henna tats?

11:01.077 --> 11:03.662
- Hey, I'll visit you in your box.
- Screw a box.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.455
Gonna have a killer house, first of all.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.558
And second, you're not visiting.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.769
You're gonna live here with me.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.606
Who says I want to
live in a beach house?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.012
Yeah, I guess I could live
in a beach house.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.782
But how are you gonna afford it?
This ain't Freeridge.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.100
I'm gonna be an architect.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.871
Design buildings, arenas,
and of course my own beach house.

11:29.522 --> 11:33.001
Only now that I know you'll be
living with me, I'm thinking multi-use.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.335
What's that mean?

11:36.279 --> 11:39.173
It means your restaurant will be
downstairs and we'll live above it.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.034
What kind of school you gotta go to
to be an architect?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.453
A good one, but I got
it all planned out.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.872
JC for a couple years to save the cash,

11:46.873 --> 11:48.391
then transfer to UCLA.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.729
It's a good plan.
How are you gonna afford it?

11:54.339 --> 11:55.481
I'll figure it out.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.567
Hey...

11:59.093 --> 12:00.403
We'll figure it out.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.166
Is this all you got?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.919
You're my blood
and don't know how to bribe me?

12:17.278 --> 12:19.005
- Qué lástima.
- Cookies?

12:20.156 --> 12:21.257
It's the right direction.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.301
I made a terrible mistake.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.078
We knew how busy you are,
so we went with Etsy,

12:26.079 --> 12:27.913
which was an even bigger mistake.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.333
And now I realize
the mistakes of my trespasses,

12:31.334 --> 12:33.919
and I said hundreds of Hail Marys.

12:33.920 --> 12:38.674
We need you. Is there anything we can do
to get back into your good graces

12:38.675 --> 12:42.278
and enlist your brilliant skills
to fix my awful dress?

12:43.054 --> 12:44.447
Well...

12:46.224 --> 12:47.700
There is something.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.194
Put the phone down.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.821
Cesar's fine. He's with Oscar.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.632
Trust me,
no one's running up on that dude.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.842
I'm putting the phone down.

13:05.910 --> 13:09.138
- How are you doing down there?
- Has this woman never worn shoes?

13:11.249 --> 13:12.916
Ugh.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.376
- Is that...
- Yep.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.752
It just fell off.

13:18.881 --> 13:19.798
Here.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.192
Hmm-mm.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.510
Hmm-mm.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.952
What?

13:31.853 --> 13:33.329
I'm so glad you're here.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.290
I'd be freaking out without you.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.159
What?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.219
He's safe.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.763
And cute. Isn't he cute?

13:53.124 --> 13:54.124
Yeah.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.588
Do you want to do a project with me?

13:59.589 --> 14:00.881
Yeah, what kind of project?

14:00.882 --> 14:03.050
I was thinking
something really, really fun.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.135
Are we gonna build a castle?

14:05.136 --> 14:08.281
We're gonna build something even better.
It's called a family tree.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.017
Come on. Family trees are awesome.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.603
- We'll start with your mom's side.
- I'm hungry.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.189
We can get a snack
right after we do this one side.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.607
I'm hungry now.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.251
Okay, we'll eat.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.671
- What are you hungry for?
- Uvas.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.405
¿Tú hablas español?

14:25.406 --> 14:27.824
- Sí, un poco.
- ¿Quién te enseño?

14:27.825 --> 14:29.326
I want to watch Trolls.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.912
No. No, no, no, no. Who taught you how
to speak Spanish? Your Mom?

14:31.913 --> 14:33.413
No, Dora.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.498
Is that your grandma?

14:34.499 --> 14:37.018
No! Dora the Explorer.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.963
My grandma's up in heaven
with our kitties.

14:45.510 --> 14:46.903
I'll get you some snacks.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.559
- Hey.
- I changed my mind.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.496
I need you to come down to the nursery.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.957
This place is too creepy to scour solo.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.860
- When can you get here?
- I can't. I'm babysitting.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.737
What? At a time like this?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.507
You told me to keep myself busy.

15:07.949 --> 15:11.868
Fine. Then stay with me
in case something goes down.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.629
What's gonna happen?
Chivo's in the hospital.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.830
True.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.124
- But I'm not alone.
- What are you talking about?

15:17.125 --> 15:18.434
It's hard to explain.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.104
Anyway, I've got Chivo's key, but...

15:23.297 --> 15:24.565
I can't find anything.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.623
Oh, my God.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.209
I think I found the lock.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.027
It works.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.574
Okay. I'm opening Chivo's drawer.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.011
Jamal? Jamal, are you okay?

15:54.412 --> 15:55.555
Juanita.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.460
That sick bastard held her captive.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.254
- He knew where she was the whole time.
- Who held who captive?

16:04.255 --> 16:07.883
Don't worry about it. You're better off
not knowing the sordid details.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.902
- Just bear with me.
- I'm here.

16:18.769 --> 16:19.870
RG. Ricky Galindo.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.048
What the hell?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.259
What is this?

16:34.285 --> 16:36.554
Monse, I'm gonna call you back.

16:47.423 --> 16:51.110
Twenty, seven, 42.

16:52.595 --> 16:53.595
Laura!

16:54.430 --> 16:55.430
Laura!

16:55.848 --> 16:58.034
My mom's calling you.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.662
Oh, right. Thanks.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.941
- Hi.
- Hey, um...

17:05.942 --> 17:08.108
Any chance you can watch the kids
a little bit longer?

17:08.109 --> 17:10.212
I'm finally in a groove
and I don't want to stop.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.882
- Sure.
- Oh, thank you so much.

17:13.241 --> 17:16.326
So, in like 30 minutes-ish,
can you make them some dinner?

17:16.327 --> 17:18.994
- I have chicken nuggets in the freezer.
- No problem.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.222
Thank you so much.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.267
Is that the Sacré-Coeur?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.353
Good eye. Have you been to Paris?

17:25.795 --> 17:28.396
No, but someday. What's it like?

17:29.131 --> 17:31.317
Amazing. Inspiring.

17:31.801 --> 17:35.237
I actually lived there for a year,
but sadly I haven't been back since.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.556
- When were you there?
- 2004.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.158
That's the year I was born.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.118
Magical year for both of us.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.232
Should we wake her up?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.733
It's a delicate dance.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.194
While we need her
to work on the dress ASAP,

17:51.195 --> 17:53.235
the more she relaxes,
the more indebted she'll feel.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.115
I think we let her sleep.

17:59.161 --> 18:03.766
Gracias. I'm so relaxed.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.961
Relaxation breeds creativity.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.045
Mm.

18:09.046 --> 18:12.382
This relaxation made me extra sleepy.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.383
Bed time!

18:13.759 --> 18:14.759
Wait.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.804
The quince's in two days.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.181
Shouldn't you be measuring her hips?
Or bust?

18:20.182 --> 18:21.617
Buenas noches.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.328
She just played us.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.274
How did she know?

18:29.275 --> 18:30.650
It's what I do!

18:44.332 --> 18:45.975
The beach was pretty dope.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.185
I'm glad we stayed for the sunset.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.649
- We need more days like this.
- Yeah.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.485
More time to hang out.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.324
You know I'd do anything for you, right?

19:03.351 --> 19:04.368
Yeah.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.788
For real... anything.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.232
I love you, mano.

19:14.779 --> 19:15.921
Dude, are you crying?

19:17.782 --> 19:20.342
Nah, fool. I got smoke in my eyes.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.642
It's been hot out here.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.187
I could get got.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.356
You can get got.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.233
Anybody can get got.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.404
- If anything ever happened to you...
- Nothing's happening to me.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.450
I know, Lil' Spooky.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.370
That's why we're here.

19:50.481 --> 19:51.916
We need to handle this.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.465
Buenas noches.

19:59.865 --> 20:00.782
Thank you, Laura.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.951
We'd love to have you come visit.
Right, guys?

20:02.952 --> 20:04.428
She was okay.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.597
That's actually a glowing endorsement.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.041
Well then, thank you, Hayden.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.211
- And I'd be happy to sit again.
- Mama, read us a story.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.631
One second. I just have to pay Laura
then put this back in my office.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.442
Mama, now!

20:19.677 --> 20:20.969
I can put that away for you.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.388
- Story!
- Story! Story, story, story, story.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.472
Okay. Okay. Okay.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.851
Would you mind? I'll just read them
a quickie, and then we can settle up.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.477
Thank you so much.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.830
Okay, come on. Let's go.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.302
What are you doing?

21:02.303 --> 21:03.845
This lady isn't your mother.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.657
"We all have a moment where we feel sad,

21:07.349 --> 21:10.953
where the moon and the sun
are not to be had.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.038
We look in the sky,

21:13.397 --> 21:15.190
we look in the air,

21:15.191 --> 21:16.941
we need our families,

21:16.942 --> 21:18.502
but they are not there.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.548
Alone, alone. Where can they be?

21:23.365 --> 21:26.302
Alone, alone. Can someone help me?"

21:30.498 --> 21:33.458
Okay, you guys read the next one
to yourselves. I'll be right back.

21:38.923 --> 21:39.923
Are you okay?

21:44.553 --> 21:46.238
Do you read to them every night?

21:47.848 --> 21:49.158
I try.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.996
I never had that.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.541
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.988
No. I'm sorry.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.366
It's just I have a lot of stuff going on

22:06.367 --> 22:07.468
and I'm...

22:08.077 --> 22:09.720
I'm not always this crazy.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.972
Hey, you're not crazy.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.059
Can I wash my face?

22:15.543 --> 22:18.646
Of course. The bathroom's on the left.

22:19.713 --> 22:20.856
Take your time.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.096
Here you go.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.282
Thank you.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.452
That's too much.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.164
But you came all this way
and you came on such a short notice.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.150
- It's okay. Take it.
- But I...

23:22.151 --> 23:23.252
I insist.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.217
You saved me.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.017
I went to school with Latrelle.

23:56.018 --> 23:58.144
- We played Pop Warner together.
- And he still pulled a gun.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.164
- But he didn't shoot.
- Next time he will.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.459
This way there's no next time.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.780
You've been playing me.
All that talk about my future was...

24:08.781 --> 24:12.676
You wanna have more days like today?
This is how we do it.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.180
Ain't no future
if you don't handle your present.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.569
Listen to me,
you shoot until you empty the clip.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.906
Don't freeze up, don't flinch,
don't second guess.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.910
It's do or die time, hermano.

24:39.645 --> 24:40.645
Wait. Hold up!

24:45.275 --> 24:46.877
Punk ass got lucky.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.445
Just for tonight.

24:51.532 --> 24:52.966
You handle this tomorrow.

25:11.677 --> 25:15.263
Twenty, seven, 42.

25:15.264 --> 25:18.683
My best guess is that these three
numbers are a combo to a lock.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.728
But where's the lock, baby girl?
Tell me.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.956
Tell your J-Daddy.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.042
I'm sorry. I'm tired. It's late.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.862
Yeah, maybe we should go,
get some sleep and...

25:33.365 --> 25:34.800
Or maybe we should stay.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.566
- Do you think Cesar will like it?
- No.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.384
He's gonna love it.

26:02.895 --> 26:03.996
Are you okay?

26:19.203 --> 26:20.846
Cesar, talk to me. What do you need?
