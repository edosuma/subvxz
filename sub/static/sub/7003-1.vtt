00:02.068 --> 00:05.503
Hey, welcome to <i>tool time.</i>
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:05.504 --> 00:07.338
You all know my assistant

00:07.339 --> 00:10.508
Al "what's the point
of having a weekend?" borland.

00:10.509 --> 00:13.011
We've been gone for two weeks
on vacation, al and I.

00:13.012 --> 00:15.680
It's good to be back.
I hope you enjoyed the reruns.

00:15.681 --> 00:18.850
While we were gone,
al, I guess you finished
that log cabin up at hope lake?

00:18.851 --> 00:20.351
Yes, tim, I have.

00:20.352 --> 00:22.386
I finished it
completely by myself.

00:22.387 --> 00:24.388
Everything in it
is made from logs.

00:24.389 --> 00:25.657
Fantastic.

00:25.658 --> 00:28.126
Can't wait to stop by
and meet the little log woman.

00:29.862 --> 00:34.365
Anyway, while al was busy
carving himself a life,

00:34.366 --> 00:37.002
I took my family
to the natural history museum
in chicago.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.037
Very educational.
A lot of fun.
Yes, it is.

00:39.038 --> 00:42.040
But we all know the worst part
of a long car trip -

00:42.041 --> 00:43.908
The family in the car.

00:43.909 --> 00:46.210
<i>(high voice)</i> "I'm tired."
"I'm hungry." "I can't see."

00:46.211 --> 00:49.213
"he's pushing." "I gotta pee."

00:49.214 --> 00:52.283
Boy, my wife was annoying.

00:52.284 --> 00:54.285
But it worked out well,

00:54.286 --> 00:56.387
Because I brought back
from the museum

00:56.388 --> 00:58.857
Some primitive tools
from primitive man.

00:58.858 --> 01:01.392
Heidi, the artifacts, please.

01:01.393 --> 01:03.394
'course, y'all know
our new tool girl.

01:03.395 --> 01:06.397
I want you all
to say howdy to heidi.

01:06.398 --> 01:07.999
<i>(all)</i> howdy, heidi!

01:08.000 --> 01:10.802
Our old tool girl moved on
to bigger and better things.

01:10.803 --> 01:13.838
Oh? Did she
accept that offer
from bob vila?

01:16.308 --> 01:18.810
She went on to college.
We both know that, al.

01:18.811 --> 01:20.478
Here are your sticks, tim.

01:20.479 --> 01:22.313
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome.

01:22.314 --> 01:24.315
They're not sticks.
These are artifacts.

01:24.316 --> 01:27.618
They look like sticks
to me.
Hm? Well, little do you know.

01:27.619 --> 01:31.189
I wouldn't pay 15 bucks
for some sticks, would I?

01:32.424 --> 01:34.425
Yes, tim, you would.

01:34.426 --> 01:37.095
They say there's a sucker
born every minute.

01:37.096 --> 01:40.231
Now we know what he does
on his vacation.

01:41.967 --> 01:43.968
Boy, gosh darn it.
That's funny.

01:43.969 --> 01:46.204
That's really funny.

01:46.205 --> 01:48.206
Maybe when you're
on your permanent vacation,

01:48.207 --> 01:51.576
You can build yourself
a log unemployment office.

01:54.780 --> 01:57.348
The point is,
to john q primitive man,
this was his source of fire.

01:57.349 --> 01:59.751
They would try
to get a spark going,
rubbing like this,

01:59.752 --> 02:01.753
To see if they could get
the kindling moving.

02:01.754 --> 02:04.255
You should be careful,
because you could start
a fire.

02:04.256 --> 02:07.358
Like I'm really gonna start
a fire with sticks like this.
You can't get a spark...

02:07.359 --> 02:09.060
Tim...
Al... Al...

02:09.061 --> 02:11.196
You're on fire.

02:11.197 --> 02:15.100
Indeed I am, al,
and, you know,
I've done this

02:15.101 --> 02:18.169
To teach the kids
an important lesson -
don't play with sticks.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.338
They can put your eye out
or ignite your forearm.

02:20.339 --> 02:22.340
Al, could you help me out?

02:22.341 --> 02:25.009
Hey! Oh! Ahh... Ooh.

03:32.244 --> 03:35.246
What do you think? Should we
put the kids in the middle?

03:38.217 --> 03:40.919
Come on, baby, let's go.
Burn it in here.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.855
Put it in the glove.
You can do it. Come on.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.426
Boys! Hey!

03:48.427 --> 03:50.628
Hey, boys, come on.
You don't wanna be late
for school.

03:50.629 --> 03:52.831
Yes, we do.

03:52.832 --> 03:56.167
If we're gonna be late,
we might as well not go at all.
Yeah.

03:56.168 --> 03:58.102
Yeah, right.

03:58.103 --> 04:00.138
You know,
when I was a kid,

04:00.139 --> 04:02.640
I could not wait
to get to school,

04:02.641 --> 04:05.977
See my teachers,
hand in my homework,

04:05.978 --> 04:08.646
Take all those tests
I always got a's on.

04:08.647 --> 04:12.150
Yeah, but I bet
you got beat up a lot.
Every day.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.618
Now move it, guys.
Have a good time at school.

04:14.619 --> 04:15.786
Bye, mom!
Love you!

04:15.787 --> 04:18.156
<i>(oogah)</i>

04:20.259 --> 04:23.561
Right!
I got the horn working
for the hot rod, huh?

04:23.562 --> 04:24.896
Really?

04:24.897 --> 04:27.899
I thought a flock of geese
had exploded in there.

04:27.900 --> 04:31.702
Speaking of a flock of geese,
your sister called.

04:31.703 --> 04:34.239
What did she say
about the ultrasound?
What is she having?

04:34.240 --> 04:36.841
A baby.

04:36.842 --> 04:39.878
I know she's having a baby.
What kind of a baby?

04:39.879 --> 04:44.015
I dunno. I hope it doesn't
look a lot like her.

04:44.016 --> 04:45.884
Ok, I'll call her.

04:45.885 --> 04:48.519
I can't believe
you're so blasé
about this.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.855
Having a baby
is a big deal.

04:50.856 --> 04:52.156
What's the big deal?

04:52.157 --> 04:55.393
Cells get together and multiply.
Poof! You got a baby.

04:55.394 --> 04:59.030
You women act as though
it's some sort of miracle.
It is a miracle.

04:59.031 --> 05:02.066
No, no, no, no, no,
a miracle is what happened

05:02.067 --> 05:04.969
To the 1980
us olympic hockey team.

05:06.772 --> 05:08.439
You women give birth,

05:08.440 --> 05:12.310
Thousands of fans
don't stand up and go,
"usa! Usa! Usa!"

05:12.311 --> 05:15.113
Well, maybe women should start
giving birth in stadiums.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.182
Well, maybe they should!
<i>(laughs)</i>

05:18.183 --> 05:21.185
Good luck getting 50,000 guys
to see that.

05:22.421 --> 05:27.058
Yeah. You know what name
I've always loved? Laura.

05:27.059 --> 05:29.794
It's simple,
it's unpretentious.

05:29.795 --> 05:32.897
Sloan? That's nice, too.

05:32.898 --> 05:35.266
<i>(imitates retching)</i>

05:35.267 --> 05:37.802
Tim just walked in.
He sends his love.

05:37.803 --> 05:40.671
Yeah. If you need anything,
give me a call.

05:40.672 --> 05:42.473
Bye.

05:42.474 --> 05:45.310
It's a girl! It's a girl.

05:45.311 --> 05:49.047
Carol is so happy.
She always wanted
to have a girl.

05:49.048 --> 05:52.516
They stayed up all last night
and painted the nursery pink.

05:52.517 --> 05:55.987
Flat or semigloss?

05:55.988 --> 05:59.324
Gee, somehow
that didn't come up.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.059
Aw.
<i>(squeaking)</i>

06:01.060 --> 06:02.793
What's all that stuff?

06:02.794 --> 06:05.896
Oh, it's some
of the boys' baby things.
I'm gonna send it to carol.

06:05.897 --> 06:08.266
I'm hoping there'll be something
that will work for a girl.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.968
Ohhh.

06:09.969 --> 06:13.371
Look at the little booties.
They're so teeny.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.738
<i>(sniffs)</i>

06:14.739 --> 06:16.307
They're brad's.

06:18.344 --> 06:22.746
Oh, and the little hat.
And the bib.

06:22.747 --> 06:27.085
Are you gonna
send the wittle bib
to the wittle baby?

06:27.086 --> 06:29.954
No, I'm keeping this around
for you.

06:29.955 --> 06:31.990
Oh, my gosh.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.924
Where'd that pink blanket
come from?

06:33.925 --> 06:36.361
I made this
when I was pregnant with mark.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.363
Remember,
I was hoping for a girl?

06:38.364 --> 06:42.166
I wanted a sweet little thing
I could cuddle on my lap,

06:42.167 --> 06:44.469
With beautiful curly hair
and big bow in it.

06:44.470 --> 06:47.405
You wanted to give birth
to a poodle.

06:50.309 --> 06:53.311
It could happen.
Look at the father.

06:57.949 --> 07:00.284
Maybe I should hold on
to this.

07:00.285 --> 07:02.586
Why would you wanna
do that?

07:02.587 --> 07:04.555
You never know.

07:04.556 --> 07:07.225
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

07:07.226 --> 07:11.295
Back the estrogen express up,
honey, huh?

07:11.296 --> 07:13.331
I see... Wait a minute.

07:13.332 --> 07:16.267
Your sister has a little girl,
now you want a little girl?

07:16.268 --> 07:18.802
So?
So?

07:18.803 --> 07:20.804
Carol gives birth
to an elephant,

07:20.805 --> 07:23.707
Does that mean
you give birth to an elephant?

07:23.708 --> 07:26.344
Great, that's just what I want -
pass a pair of tusks.

07:26.345 --> 07:27.978
Ouch.

07:30.282 --> 07:34.252
<i>(moaning and howling</i>
<i>on television)</i>

07:34.253 --> 07:37.255
I thought you guys
weren't supposed to watch
that <i>goosebump theater.</i>

07:37.256 --> 07:39.257
Doesn't it
give you nightmares?

07:39.258 --> 07:42.460
<i>Tool time</i> gives us nightmares,
and you make us watch that.

07:44.029 --> 07:46.164
<i>(chain saw buzzing,</i>
<i>man screaming)</i>

07:46.165 --> 07:50.568
Hey, he's going after those guys
with a binford 5100 chain saw.

07:50.569 --> 07:53.204
That's a chain saw and a half.
Good choice, ghoul.

07:53.205 --> 07:56.074
Dad, aren't you a little old
to have a security blanket?

07:56.075 --> 07:59.544
He got it when he stopped
sucking his thumb.

07:59.545 --> 08:02.146
Maybe you'll recognize
some of the other stuff
in here.

08:02.147 --> 08:05.916
Oh, look,
it's brad's training pants.

08:05.917 --> 08:08.486
You used 'em last weekend,
didn't you?

08:09.854 --> 08:12.356
What's this?

08:12.357 --> 08:13.991
Randy's brain.

08:13.992 --> 08:17.428
I'm sending
your old baby stuff
to aunt carol.

08:17.429 --> 08:20.364
Hey, wait a minute.
That blanket wasn't ours.

08:20.365 --> 08:23.201
Your mom knitted this
when she was having mark.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.203
It's pink.

08:25.204 --> 08:28.272
Mom must have known
mark would be a girl.

08:28.273 --> 08:31.275
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Your mother was praying
for a girl

08:31.276 --> 08:33.977
After she had
you two buttheads.

08:35.179 --> 08:36.780
Whoa.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.450
Mom really wanted mark
to be a girl.

08:39.451 --> 08:41.385
Yeah.

08:41.385 --> 08:43.787
I think we can have
some fun with this.

08:44.889 --> 08:47.391
Oh, uh... Mark!

08:48.693 --> 08:49.994
Come on in here.

08:49.995 --> 08:52.196
What do you want?

08:52.197 --> 08:55.500
Buddy... Have a seat.

08:57.102 --> 08:59.170
<i>(sighs)</i>

08:59.171 --> 09:01.038
<i>(sighs)</i>

09:01.039 --> 09:04.542
Well, we just found out
some awful news from dad,

09:04.543 --> 09:08.479
And we wanted to tell you
before you heard it
from a stranger.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.847
What?

09:09.848 --> 09:12.617
Well, dad told us
that when mom had you,

09:12.618 --> 09:14.818
She really wanted a girl.

09:14.819 --> 09:16.120
You're lying.

09:16.121 --> 09:18.789
He just showed us
the pink blanket
she made for you.

09:18.790 --> 09:21.091
He did not.
You know how
she's always saying

09:21.092 --> 09:23.093
She wants to bake
with you.

09:23.094 --> 09:25.095
And how she's always
taking you shopping.

09:25.096 --> 09:28.065
She's pretending
you're her daughter.

09:33.905 --> 09:36.907
Well, I just got off the phone
with carol.

09:36.908 --> 09:39.943
She's so excited.
The baby moved today.

09:39.944 --> 09:43.514
Where to,
that all-baby condo downtown?

09:43.515 --> 09:47.418
<i>(horn honks)</i>
hey, boys, bus is here!

09:47.419 --> 09:49.487
Ugh. Yuck!

09:49.488 --> 09:52.256
How many scoops did you use
in this stuff?

09:52.257 --> 09:55.660
12. I'm making
"tim taylor more power" coffee.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.127
Arr.

09:57.128 --> 09:59.697
Hey, I'll race you
to ann arbor.

10:01.366 --> 10:04.302
Hey, brad!
Yeah?

10:04.303 --> 10:07.071
Brad, don't forget you have
a dentist appointment today,

10:07.072 --> 10:09.907
And don't try
to get detention
to get out of it again.

10:09.908 --> 10:12.743
Ha. Like he has to try.

10:12.744 --> 10:16.880
Hey. Mark,
we're gonna make a cake
when I get home from work.

10:16.881 --> 10:18.782
I'm not helping you.

10:18.783 --> 10:21.185
How come? You love
to make cakes.

10:21.186 --> 10:23.321
I'm never baking again.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.558
What's with him?

10:27.559 --> 10:29.126
I don't know,

10:29.127 --> 10:31.696
But I'm sure gonna miss
his brownies.

10:35.867 --> 10:38.402
Tim.

10:38.403 --> 10:40.204
Tim.

10:40.205 --> 10:41.239
Tim!

10:41.240 --> 10:44.108
What? I love it.
It looks good.

10:46.010 --> 10:49.046
Your, uh...
The hair, perfect.

10:49.047 --> 10:51.482
New outfit? Thinner?
Younger?

10:53.485 --> 10:55.486
Thank you,
but that's not it.

10:55.487 --> 10:57.821
Remember what we were
talking about last night?

10:57.822 --> 11:01.759
Oh, the baby. I won't
bring it up again, promise.
I'm bringing it up.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.696
Come on, haven't you thought
about how nice it would be
to have a little girl?

11:05.697 --> 11:09.199
No! We have all the kids
we can stand right now.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.603
We never actually said
that we weren't gonna
have another baby.

11:12.604 --> 11:15.439
I've said it.
I know I've talked about it.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.441
I mentioned it on <i>tool time.</i>

11:17.442 --> 11:21.379
Oh, great.
So 11 people know about it?

11:21.380 --> 11:23.381
You remember babies at all?

11:23.382 --> 11:26.350
Dirty diapers. Colic?

11:26.351 --> 11:29.953
2am feedings. 3am feedings.
I don't have the energy
for that anymore.

11:29.954 --> 11:34.825
You don't have the energy
to say, "wake up, jill,
the baby wants you"?

11:41.966 --> 11:46.270
At this point in my life,
I don't have the energy to say,
"wake up, jill, <i>I</i> want you."

11:49.408 --> 11:51.409
So you're
just shutting the door

11:51.410 --> 11:53.411
On the whole idea
of having a baby?

11:53.412 --> 11:55.780
I'm shutting the door.
That's your last word?

11:55.781 --> 11:58.616
I've shut the door,
put a chest in front of it,

11:58.617 --> 12:00.751
And there's a fat guy
sitting on it.
What?

12:00.752 --> 12:03.487
And he's holding al's mom
in his lap.

12:07.192 --> 12:09.960
As sure as a bear
takes reading material
into the woods,

12:09.961 --> 12:13.331
Tools lose their edge.

12:13.332 --> 12:16.367
That's why al and I are doing
our <i>tool time</i> salute...

12:16.368 --> 12:17.868
<i>(grinding noise)</i>

12:17.869 --> 12:19.370
...To sharpeners.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.672
Before we get to the meat
of the show, though,

12:21.673 --> 12:24.174
Something happened
at my house today
that got me thinking,

12:24.175 --> 12:26.176
And I was wondering...
Tim?

12:26.177 --> 12:29.179
Didn't you promise this year
that you would stick to tools

12:29.180 --> 12:31.349
And not get into
your personal life?

12:31.350 --> 12:33.851
A promise is a promise,
isn't it?

12:33.852 --> 12:35.720
But does this mean anything
to you at all?

12:38.122 --> 12:39.690
So, I was hoping...

12:39.691 --> 12:42.292
How would you like it
if I talked about
my personal life?

12:42.293 --> 12:44.862
When you get one,
we'll talk about it.

12:46.631 --> 12:49.933
Right now, I'd like to talk
about women and babies.

12:49.934 --> 12:53.070
What is the big deal?
Women and babies,
babies and women.

12:53.071 --> 12:56.340
If women gave birth to cars,
that would be a big deal.

12:56.341 --> 12:58.342
You'd have guys lined up
in delivery rooms

12:58.343 --> 13:00.110
Seeing that stuff, huh?
<i>(man)</i> yeah.

13:00.111 --> 13:02.980
Imagine your wife delivering
a 3,000-pound ferrari. Yeah!

13:02.981 --> 13:04.648
Oh, yeah.

13:04.649 --> 13:08.819
Slip it in gear,
kiss your wife,
drive the baby home.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.621
Can we get on with the show?

13:10.622 --> 13:13.323
Let's introduce
our guest star tonight -

13:13.324 --> 13:15.593
The binford xjb bench grinder.

13:15.594 --> 13:17.595
Three-quarter horsepower
motor.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.930
And it spins
at a manly 3400 rpm.

13:19.931 --> 13:21.465
Arr-arr-arr.

13:21.466 --> 13:24.402
<i>(motor whining)</i>
oh!

13:24.403 --> 13:27.237
Now, you'll notice
al's wearing safety goggles.

13:27.238 --> 13:29.306
They not only protect
his eyes,

13:29.307 --> 13:32.075
But they give al
that intellectual look.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.982
If we can bring
the camera over here,
I'll show you what al's doing.

13:38.983 --> 13:41.218
He keeps the ax blade
against the wheel

13:41.219 --> 13:43.220
At a 45° angle.

13:43.221 --> 13:45.556
That helps retain
the original bevel.

13:45.557 --> 13:49.427
And I don't know about you,
but I revel in al's bevel.

13:49.428 --> 13:51.896
There you are, tim.
Sharp as new.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.964
All right, there's ways
to see if they're sharp.

13:53.965 --> 13:57.267
The first way...
<i>(loud grinding noise)</i>

13:57.268 --> 13:59.970
Warn me
when you do that stuff, al.

13:59.971 --> 14:01.739
Ok...

14:05.276 --> 14:09.012
There we go. Sharp as new.

14:09.013 --> 14:11.348
Gettin' a little rough
on that beard.

14:11.349 --> 14:13.183
You want me
to trim it up for you?

14:13.184 --> 14:15.018
I don't think so, tim.

14:15.019 --> 14:16.854
Come on, trust me, al.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.323
Based on what?

14:19.324 --> 14:22.125
You know, I expected
that response out of you.

14:22.126 --> 14:25.062
That's why
the guys at binford and I
came up with a special project.

14:25.063 --> 14:27.164
Heidi, how about
that special project?

14:30.001 --> 14:32.402
This is test dummy al.

14:32.403 --> 14:33.437
Here you go, tim.

14:33.438 --> 14:34.538
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome.

14:34.539 --> 14:36.540
Every last detail
is the same as al,

14:36.541 --> 14:38.408
Except he's a bit
more animated.

14:38.409 --> 14:40.711
Oh, that's beard's
a little rough.

14:40.712 --> 14:43.113
You want me to shave it
for you? Sure.

14:43.114 --> 14:45.850
All right, there you go. Ok.

14:45.851 --> 14:49.052
Of course I think I do
all the work around here.
Thanks for saying so.

14:49.053 --> 14:51.989
I'm your idol?
Oh, come on, buddy... Ooh!

14:51.990 --> 14:54.024
Uh-oh. Cut a little deep.

14:54.025 --> 14:57.595
Oh, whoa!
Al, al, buddy.

14:57.596 --> 14:59.730
Can you do that, al?

15:00.866 --> 15:03.901
Mark, come on down
and have some cake with me.

15:03.902 --> 15:06.637
I don't want any cake.

15:06.638 --> 15:10.841
Don't tell me you've given up
eating cake, too?

15:10.842 --> 15:13.377
It's angel food...

15:13.378 --> 15:15.946
Made with real angels.

15:15.947 --> 15:18.415
Luckily they're in season.

15:18.416 --> 15:20.918
I don't want any cake.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.219
<i>(typing)</i>

15:22.220 --> 15:24.354
Sweetie, why don't you
just tell me what's wrong?

15:24.355 --> 15:27.625
Nothing's wrong.
And don't call me "sweetie."

15:27.626 --> 15:31.028
I always call you "sweetie."

15:31.029 --> 15:34.031
That's because
you wanted me to be a girl.

15:34.032 --> 15:37.334
Who told you that?
Brad and randy.

15:37.335 --> 15:40.771
Well, they're grounded
for a week.

15:40.772 --> 15:44.241
Honey, you know better
than to listen to them.

15:44.242 --> 15:46.544
They're always trying
to torment you.

15:46.545 --> 15:49.446
You mean, you didn't want me
to be a girl?

15:49.447 --> 15:53.017
Well... Well, maybe
a part of me did.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.552
Oh.

15:54.553 --> 15:58.022
But that doesn't mean
I wasn't thrilled to have you.

15:58.023 --> 16:01.425
The minute I laid eyes on you,
I just fell in love.

16:01.426 --> 16:05.930
All that matted hair,
little squished face,

16:05.931 --> 16:08.398
Wrinkled little body.

16:08.399 --> 16:10.634
You looked just like
your father.

16:12.370 --> 16:15.505
But you really wanted a girl.

16:18.009 --> 16:20.410
Mark, do you remember
your fifth birthday?

16:20.411 --> 16:24.982
Yeah. Brad and randy made me
eat the candles on my cake.

16:24.983 --> 16:27.785
So they're grounded
for another week.

16:27.786 --> 16:29.787
Remember you wanted a dog,

16:29.788 --> 16:33.223
And we thought
that you weren't old enough
to take care of one,

16:33.224 --> 16:35.593
And so we got you a turtle.

16:35.594 --> 16:39.429
Even though you wanted the dog,
you really loved that turtle,
didn't you?

16:39.430 --> 16:43.233
Mm-hmm. Till he got squished
by the truck.

16:43.234 --> 16:45.235
I'm sure he didn't feel
a thing.

16:45.236 --> 16:46.737
Anyway, the point is,

16:46.738 --> 16:49.607
You wouldn't have traded
that turtle for the world,

16:49.608 --> 16:52.576
And I would not trade you
for the world.

16:52.577 --> 16:54.277
You wouldn't?

16:54.278 --> 16:55.579
No way.

16:55.580 --> 16:59.583
I've had a dozen offers,
at least, just today.

16:59.584 --> 17:01.585
Would you trade brad
or randy?

17:01.586 --> 17:03.587
Like that.

17:07.525 --> 17:10.260
<i>(wilson mumbles)</i>

17:10.261 --> 17:13.363
<i>Dobry dyen,</i>
good neighbor.
Huh?

17:13.364 --> 17:15.833
That's russian
for "hi-de-ho."

17:17.367 --> 17:22.305
I'm playing chess by mail
with a grand master in moscow.

17:24.407 --> 17:28.145
Got a minute?
Tim, I am your pawn.

17:32.150 --> 17:34.584
Jill wants to have
another baby.

17:34.585 --> 17:37.320
Well, tim, I'm not sure
I can help you there.

17:39.257 --> 17:42.860
That's not the area
I'm having trouble with.
Arr-arr-arr.

17:44.529 --> 17:48.298
She... Her sister carol
is having a little girl,

17:48.299 --> 17:50.801
And I think
it's stirring stuff in jill.

17:50.802 --> 17:52.803
I think she'd like to have
a little girl.

17:52.804 --> 17:55.405
Ah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm...
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:55.406 --> 17:58.408
And I get the feeling
that you're not happy
about the event.

17:58.409 --> 18:00.944
I like the things
just the way they are.

18:00.945 --> 18:03.681
The house, the kids, jill.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.784
I have 276 power tools.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.155
So, what you're
telling me, tim -

18:11.156 --> 18:13.157
You feel
your life is complete.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.159
Yeah, in a manner
of speaking, sure.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.161
Maybe jill doesn't feel
the same way.

18:17.162 --> 18:19.163
What's that supposed to mean?

18:19.164 --> 18:23.067
I think what jill is after...
Is a legacy.

18:23.068 --> 18:27.171
A japanese car.

18:27.172 --> 18:30.273
<i>(laughs)</i>
that's a good one, tim.
That's a good one.

18:30.274 --> 18:33.610
A legacy. Something
that's passed down,
like, generational?

18:33.611 --> 18:35.746
Exactly, and that's what
you have with your sons.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.915
You'll be able to pass on
your accumulated wisdom,

18:37.916 --> 18:40.017
The things you've learned
about being a man.

18:40.018 --> 18:41.985
We've already started that,
yeah.

18:41.986 --> 18:45.322
Last weekend I taught 'em all
how to burp the alphabet.

18:45.323 --> 18:47.624
Actually, I'm talking
about more than burping.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.627
You see, tim,
what your sons give you
is immortality,

18:50.628 --> 18:53.130
And I think maybe
that's what jill wants -

18:53.131 --> 18:55.833
To see a part of herself
live on.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.868
So that's why
she'd want a girl.

18:57.869 --> 18:59.870
Thanks, wilson.
You've been a help.

18:59.871 --> 19:01.872
<i>Do svidaniya,</i>
good neighbor.

19:01.873 --> 19:03.874
Do-si-do to you, too.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.946
Jill, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

19:08.947 --> 19:11.949
Are you still talking
to me?
No.

19:11.950 --> 19:15.619
I can respect that. So...

19:15.620 --> 19:18.622
You just sit there and listen,
and I'll talk.

19:18.623 --> 19:21.125
I think I know
why you want a daughter.

19:21.126 --> 19:23.526
You want to be immortal,
like me.

19:27.198 --> 19:28.632
You're immortal?

19:28.633 --> 19:32.469
Long after I'm gone,
the boys will still be burping.

19:32.470 --> 19:33.904
What?

19:33.905 --> 19:36.874
But you don't have a jill jr.
To pass on girl stuff to.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.942
Oh, girl stuff, huh?

19:38.943 --> 19:41.979
Like cooking and cleaning
and doing laundry?

19:41.980 --> 19:43.480
Don't forget darning socks.

19:43.481 --> 19:45.816
That's a skill
I'd hate to see die out.

19:45.817 --> 19:48.485
I'm kidding. What I'm saying
is if I can be immortal,

19:48.486 --> 19:50.520
You should be able
to be immortal, too.

19:50.521 --> 19:52.522
So, let's... Let's...

19:52.523 --> 19:54.858
Let's talk
about having a daughter.

19:56.661 --> 19:59.263
Are you serious?

19:59.264 --> 20:03.967
Yeah. And then I could build her
a little barbie dream house.

20:03.968 --> 20:06.036
And I'd remodel
the whole downstairs,

20:06.037 --> 20:08.705
Put in a rec room,
a little weight room for ken,

20:08.706 --> 20:10.908
A little back door for gi joe.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.581
Thank you, sweetie.

20:18.582 --> 20:21.885
But you know what?
I really don't want
to have a baby right now.

20:21.886 --> 20:24.922
I didn't mean this minute.
No! I've been thinking
about it.

20:24.923 --> 20:28.391
The truth is that
I don't really have time
in my life for it right now.

20:28.392 --> 20:32.562
You know? I got the job,
three kids...

20:32.563 --> 20:34.832
Well, four, including you.
Wait, wait. Excuse me.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.868
What did you get so out of joint
this morning for?
I was mad.

20:37.869 --> 20:40.670
You made up your mind
we weren't gonna have
any kids,

20:40.671 --> 20:42.706
And you didn't care
what I felt about it.

20:42.707 --> 20:45.442
You came
out of nowhere with this.
Having a baby's a big deal.

20:45.443 --> 20:48.011
It's up there with putting in
a new sprinkler system -

20:48.012 --> 20:50.013
Which we should talk about.
Tim...

20:50.014 --> 20:52.782
Let me get this straight.
You don't want to have
a new kid?

20:52.783 --> 20:55.685
I don't want you to rule out
the possibility.

20:55.686 --> 20:58.488
Well... How do you feel
about a sprinkler system?

21:00.191 --> 21:02.960
Look, I just want to know
that we can still talk
about this.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.428
Why didn't you
just say it like that?

21:05.429 --> 21:07.264
You wouldn't let me.

21:07.265 --> 21:10.734
You shut the door
and put a big fat guy
in front of it.

21:10.735 --> 21:13.337
Holding al's mom.

21:13.338 --> 21:16.240
So, I should just leave
the door open?

21:16.241 --> 21:18.242
I just want you to listen.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.244
What would happen
if we had another boy?

21:20.245 --> 21:23.113
The last thing in the world
this house needs
is more testosterone.

21:23.114 --> 21:25.615
It's practically dripping
down the walls as it is.

21:25.616 --> 21:27.117
<i>(growls)</i> yeah.

21:27.118 --> 21:29.819
There's hair growing
on that wall right there.

21:41.165 --> 21:43.233
<i>(groans)</i>

21:47.238 --> 21:49.072
Oh, shut the blinds,

21:49.073 --> 21:52.709
Let the whole neighborhood
know there's something
going on in here.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.711
Come here, mr. Immortal.

21:54.712 --> 21:58.248
<i>(grunts)</i>

21:58.249 --> 22:00.083
Mnh-mnh-mnh-mnh.

22:00.084 --> 22:02.519
Did you brush
your teeth?

22:02.520 --> 22:06.390
Tim, I just brushed 'em.
Could you brush 'em again,
please?

22:06.391 --> 22:08.959
And get that stinky stuff
way in the back.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.195
Well, you've pretty much
killed the mood.

22:12.196 --> 22:14.264
Wait till you walk in there.

22:36.854 --> 22:39.089
Come on.
I'm waiting, honey.

22:41.525 --> 22:45.528
Well, I brushed, I flossed.

22:45.529 --> 22:48.966
I hope that I don't offend you
this time.

22:51.469 --> 22:53.770
So, al,
what are you doing here?

22:53.771 --> 22:56.406
It's not Tuesday.

23:02.746 --> 23:05.215
No, no, no,
a miracle is what happened

23:05.216 --> 23:08.918
To the 1980 us olynkic...
Olympic hinkuskus.

23:11.889 --> 23:15.292
It's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.

23:15.293 --> 23:16.759
Yes, it is.
All right.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.096
No, no, no, a miracle
is what happened
