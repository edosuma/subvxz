00:01.168 --> 00:03.421
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.588 --> 00:07.466
Do you see an Earth that can be saved?
It's too late.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.010
It's already been quaked apart.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.053
We need to make sure
this world never comes to be.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.055
Yeah. No matter what.

00:13.556 --> 00:16.892
- We found a literal piece of the puzzle.
- The Monolith, it's been fractured.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.853
The shard fits into the machine
right here.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.313
- This could be our way home.
- Yeah, but the shard alone isn't enough.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.565
We need the whole Monolith.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.151
You've seen what I can do. All right?
I can help.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.446
You say his geokinesis is the key
to building a new Monolith.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.530
<i>That's the idea.</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:31.657
Won't matter if we can't make it back
to the Lighthouse.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.200
Everybody buckle in!

00:40.833 --> 00:42.793
- We spotted something that...
- Let me guess.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.379
<i>The Destroyer and her friends
are heading here.</i>

00:45.588 --> 00:47.506
- Yes, but how do you...
- Ready a squad.

00:48.591 --> 00:51.010
Kasius, apologies, but how did you know?

00:51.177 --> 00:53.345
They have a Seer telling them
what's to come.

00:53.763 --> 00:55.639
Well, I have one of my own.

01:52.071 --> 01:53.114
No.

01:55.074 --> 01:58.452
Tear the ship apart. Find them!

02:21.892 --> 02:22.893
All clear.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.691
Hopefully,
we can say the same for Enoch.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.905
No life-forms detected.

03:03.309 --> 03:07.354
The diversion seems to have worked.
They're still searching the ship.

03:08.147 --> 03:11.942
- Good. You're secure?
<i>- Yes. The machine will be online</i>

03:12.193 --> 03:14.111
<i>by the time Flint builds the Monolith.</i>

03:15.571 --> 03:16.989
Easier said than done.

03:31.295 --> 03:35.007
So, one more time, the machine
uses the little piece

03:35.174 --> 03:37.092
to trigger the bigger piece through space?

03:37.259 --> 03:38.469
Yeah, or time.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.804
It mirrors the harmonic resonant frequency
of photons,

03:40.971 --> 03:42.223
which can exist out of space-time.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.183
Yeah, I... I hear you saying words,
but what... what do they...

03:44.350 --> 03:46.560
If Flint can't construct the Monolith,
none of this matters.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.395
Robin said he can, so I believe it.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.314
We'll talk him through it
once we meet them.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.733
We can't go yet. There are still people
in danger.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.402
Coulson's on it. He's rescuing
the Inhumans right now.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.779
But not the dead ones.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.115
Look, when I was brought back,

04:00.324 --> 04:02.868
I heard someone else
going through the same pain,

04:03.035 --> 04:06.288
- the same process.
- Being revived? Who?

04:06.455 --> 04:10.417
- Some Inhuman. Has to be.
- They're the only thing Kasius values.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.253
Look, if we don't find them,
nobody will.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.420
It's a whole other section...

04:13.629 --> 04:15.297
Yeah, but right now, you need to get
on that trawler.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.675
People are depending on you to fly them up
to safety.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.385
Show me where to go, I'll go.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.265
Tess is needed at the trawler.
You guys meet Fitz-Simmons.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.017
I'll save whoever I can and meet you
at the rendezvous. Easy.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.519
Nothing about that sounds easy.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.272
You two get that thing to Flint.
We'll worry about survivors...

04:31.438 --> 04:32.731
- And kill Kasius.
- ...get them to safety.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.109
And then we kill Kasius?
When does that happen?

04:35.276 --> 04:37.820
Because some of us aren't getting out
of here on a magic rock.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.823
We won't leave until humanity's in control
of its future.

04:41.198 --> 04:44.827
But in the meantime, everyone do your job,
meet at the rendezvous point.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.420
Mack, it's an Inhuman in pain.
I have to go.

04:55.921 --> 04:56.922
Elena...

04:57.006 --> 04:58.674
- you're gonna be out of contact with us,
- Look at you.

04:58.841 --> 04:59.842
- no comms.
- A few days ago,

05:00.009 --> 05:01.260
you were begging for spare mushrooms.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.388
- Now you're the key to saving the world.
- Look, don't say that.

05:05.014 --> 05:07.016
I liked it better when I was flying
under the radar.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.225
Kid with that hair,

05:08.392 --> 05:10.144
you were never under the radar.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.691
You'll do great. Get back safe, okay?

05:20.529 --> 05:22.906
Take care of the big guy. He worries.

05:43.594 --> 05:44.595
I'm here.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.056
I'm here...

05:47.848 --> 05:49.892
to care for you as you've cared for me.

05:52.895 --> 05:53.896
Fix her.

05:54.521 --> 05:58.400
- This damage is beyond repair.
- We do it all the time. For Inhumans.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.111
The trash girl I sent as my messenger.
Fix her.

06:01.278 --> 06:05.866
Terran biology is simple. Sinara is Kree.
It won't work. You know this.

06:06.033 --> 06:11.246
- Stop defying me and fix her.
- With respect, she's dead.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.624
I don't know how to remedy that
for our kind.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.839
Then I suggest you study the condition
more closely.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.053
Fetch the Inhuman trainer.

06:30.933 --> 06:35.020
Look at me, clawing at the walls
of my own mind.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.399
I envy your sleep.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.694
You rest while S.H.I.E.L.D. stalks
my every move.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.447
Scavengers.

06:49.284 --> 06:53.163
No, you're right. They plot to destroy
my enterprise

06:53.414 --> 06:56.041
as they did the world my father
lusted after.

07:07.052 --> 07:10.305
Tell me these scraps are not all
that was recovered from the ship.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.350
From the old woman you sent
to the surface...

07:14.226 --> 07:17.521
- years ago. Who spoke of the prophecy?
- I remember.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.775
She who predicted they'd come
through time.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.110
Yes.

07:24.153 --> 07:26.363
- I think she intended them...
- To go back.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.160
Of course.

07:33.162 --> 07:37.499
Every word from my Seer's mouth confirms
they would.

07:38.750 --> 07:43.380
And if they're here, they have
yet to crack the world apart.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.801
Well, picture it, Sinara.

07:48.427 --> 07:52.556
To them, it's still lush... still whole.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.226
Tye.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.314
You've never seen the Earth as it was.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.192
My father...

08:05.861 --> 08:10.115
who had better vision than his race
who shunned him...

08:11.074 --> 08:12.659
called it a hidden blue gem.

08:14.578 --> 08:17.331
He and his entire confederacy wanted it
for their own.

08:22.252 --> 08:27.466
Gather my Inhumans, a fighting force
to crush S.H.I.E.L.D.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.093
With them out of the past...

08:30.802 --> 08:34.306
my father will then encounter
no resistance.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.645
Earth... waiting for his embrace.

08:41.730 --> 08:46.026
Yes, but the remaining Inhumans
are barely trained.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.998
My family has a tradition.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.168
When all is lost...

09:05.963 --> 09:07.339
you die with honour.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.592
Drink the Odium.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.850
It burns through the body.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.604
All strength, no pain.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.445
A fearsome last stand.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.035
A brilliant flash of violent splendour.

09:46.712 --> 09:48.088
Go fight.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.924
Until the last moment

09:51.133 --> 09:56.680
when your heart bursts with rage.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.809
If we ever get out of here...

10:02.019 --> 10:04.479
I'm gonna tour my bike
down a very scenic highway

10:04.646 --> 10:06.231
till the wheels melt off.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.693
Isn't that the thing that kids ride?

10:10.861 --> 10:12.279
It's a motorcycle.

10:14.906 --> 10:18.702
Imagine a... a rocket on two wheels...

10:19.870 --> 10:21.413
with a place to hold on.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.042
- Huh. Sounds crazy.
- Yeah, you'd dig it.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.340
You know...

10:32.424 --> 10:34.426
Earth isn't a bad place to grow up.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.888
If you want to come...

10:39.681 --> 10:41.850
you'd always have a home
with me and Yo-Yo.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.772
Yeah, well, still don't know
how I'm supposed to build a time machine.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.524
It's a portal, not a time machine.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.780
And you'll build it with this.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.546
Let's go! Go! Go! Get the Inhumans
to the trawler!

11:15.092 --> 11:16.885
Guns, man! It's like cheating!

11:17.135 --> 11:19.680
You shouldn't give these to anyone
that's not a really, really good person.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.265
- You think there'd be a law.
- Daisy!

11:48.583 --> 11:53.004
- What happened to you?
- Kasius freed me. I feel no pain.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.224
Feel that?

12:07.602 --> 12:08.603
You okay?

12:09.271 --> 12:11.982
- Just a wardrobe malfunction. You?
- Yeah.

12:12.190 --> 12:16.945
Turns out they have PCP in space.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.708
I heard you were dead.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.504
You look good for dead. I mean, I...

12:35.380 --> 12:37.883
You don't look great, but you... I mean,
you've been through

12:38.049 --> 12:40.552
- something but...
- It's good to see you too, Deke.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.775
I've been where you are right now.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.820
Something like this... changes you.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.655
Yeah?

13:02.282 --> 13:06.620
I keep questioning, what happened,
what's real.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.291
That's real, and it's worth the cost.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.172
Okay. This trawler's almost ready.
We should get to the rendezvous.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.466
You okay flying them up
to the human levels?

13:19.633 --> 13:21.426
I've been watching enough to manage
on my own.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.137
I'll be back for Flint,
anyone else coming up.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.598
Good. Now get out of here.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.105
You were right.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.399
We can fight back.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.305
The ambush cost us the last
of our Inhumans.

14:07.472 --> 14:11.226
But there's nowhere to go.
They will be caught. Trust me.

14:14.604 --> 14:18.024
"Trust," he says, over and again.

14:18.650 --> 14:23.321
Tye, the doctor, my royal guards...
Failures, all.

14:26.324 --> 14:31.162
- Even you, if I'm being honest.
- Sir. Sir, we need a plan.

14:31.329 --> 14:34.416
Silence! Can't you see
we're discussing one?

14:45.927 --> 14:47.345
I, too, have failed.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.515
Lost Inhumans.

14:51.892 --> 14:52.893
Lost you.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.062
The glory we sought evades us.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.112
But if I pledge myself...

15:07.365 --> 15:09.993
I could still give my father everything
he desired...

15:10.952 --> 15:13.038
help elevate the Kasius family name.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.139
I know there's a path back to glory.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.519
A path back to you.

15:43.360 --> 15:48.740
My Seer's knowledge has run dry.
That, or she has misled us.

15:51.952 --> 15:57.040
Either way, it's time I used her
to send one last message of my own.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.399
Hello?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.194
I'm here to help.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.575
What's your name?

16:36.579 --> 16:37.622
Elena.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.584
It's good to see you.

16:47.716 --> 16:48.967
This is a trick.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.761
I thought the same thing
when I was standing where you are.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.389
- This isn't real.
- I wish it were true.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.308
An LMD or a framework illusion...

16:58.309 --> 17:02.272
- but it's me. I'm you.
- How? I...

17:02.439 --> 17:07.152
I waited so long to see myself again.
Still with hope in my eyes.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.819
How are you alive?

17:10.613 --> 17:15.577
They killed me. Brought me back
to take my blood, my DNA.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.747
Then again and again. For years.

17:19.664 --> 17:23.960
They revive me when they want...
kill me when they don't.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.714
What? How? How many times?

17:28.423 --> 17:30.759
I held on to the thought of this moment.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.722
No. This is wrong.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.685
But this time, when they asked me
how our team fought back,

17:40.852 --> 17:46.566
I tried to give them as little as I could.
But I knew you were close.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.360
You and...

17:50.070 --> 17:51.196
Mack.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.993
Mack. He's still alive.

17:59.120 --> 18:04.375
- Hold him for as long as you can.
- What happens to Mack? What happens?

18:04.542 --> 18:07.003
I practiced so many times what to say.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.715
I wanted to be better, save you
from the pain.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.510
But seeing you...

18:15.637 --> 18:18.890
- all the pain comes back.
- You've been here this whole time?

18:20.475 --> 18:24.687
- Stuck in the loop... like you.
- The loop?

18:26.731 --> 18:28.316
We make it back in time.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.445
But then we bring everything
that's to come.

18:32.654 --> 18:37.117
- I... I don't believe that.
- I know.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.620
I don't think I did either...

18:41.454 --> 18:45.125
until I was on fire, reaching for Mack.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.460
And then there was nothing there.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.379
Well, you can tell me how to stop it,
right?

18:49.963 --> 18:53.675
- How do we change it?
- I'm not sure you can.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.693
Hello, again. They have located me.

19:12.735 --> 19:15.613
<i>Repeat, they have located me.</i>

19:17.365 --> 19:19.117
We copy. You sure they found you?

19:19.284 --> 19:21.661
The evidence is highly suggestive.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.496
We never should have left him alone.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.124
We're here forever if he loses control
of that machine.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.251
Enoch, how long can you hold out?

19:34.132 --> 19:36.009
I calculate 12 minutes.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.053
What? That is not enough time.
That machine activates

19:39.220 --> 19:42.098
- a Monolith we haven't even built yet.
- We have to go secure the <i>Zephyr.</i>

19:42.265 --> 19:44.517
Oh, damn it. Really?

19:44.684 --> 19:47.353
We had to leave the machine
in the hands of some automaton?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.939
I knew the moment that I laid eyes
on all of you

19:50.106 --> 19:52.192
that it was gonna spell my downfall.

19:58.865 --> 19:59.908
I'll go.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.579
I'll secure the machine and save
the weird robot.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.166
Well, I'll come. It'd be better if we take
the plane together.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.002
Yeah. No duh. But none
of the time travellers can go,

20:11.085 --> 20:12.462
because you all need to be
at the rendezvous

20:12.545 --> 20:14.255
when it's turned on, so do the math.

20:14.505 --> 20:18.176
You're one guy against the Kree.
You'll be massively outgunned.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.595
I'm kind of trying to do
the whole hero thing here, man.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.805
Is that your pep talk?

20:23.473 --> 20:25.433
You guys get killed,
and who saves the world then?

20:27.101 --> 20:29.395
I told my parents not to believe
in this Roach-crap fairy tale,

20:29.562 --> 20:32.899
and they went, and they died for it
anyway. And I'm probably next in line.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.277
But there is no way in hell
that I am gonna let some blue Kreeper

20:36.486 --> 20:39.405
destroy that machine before I get to see
whether or not that damn thing

20:39.572 --> 20:41.532
- was worth any of this.
- Look, I'm sure you put up a good fight,

20:41.616 --> 20:43.076
but if my ride home
depends on that machine,

20:43.243 --> 20:46.412
- I'm gonna secure it myself.
- You... you drive me out of my skull,

20:46.579 --> 20:48.414
this part of you, this impetuous,

20:48.665 --> 20:50.792
- bull-headed squab...
- I was offering backup, genius.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.753
No, when the other side of you
is a friggin' hero

20:53.920 --> 20:57.382
who can't help herself but do good,
then be great.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.637
The world needs that person
to make it home.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.145
Just try not to destroy it
when you get there.

21:13.106 --> 21:16.234
- It was almost nice knowing you.
- And you're a pain in my ass.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.865
- I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
- Okay.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.744
Close your eyes and concentrate
on the stone.

21:30.331 --> 21:31.457
Can you feel it?

21:33.042 --> 21:36.296
- Yes... and I can move it.
- Not yet.

21:36.671 --> 21:39.966
So, every part of the universe,
from the stars to this stone

21:40.133 --> 21:42.093
are basically made from the same things,

21:42.260 --> 21:44.637
and you're in touch
with its mineral composition.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.931
- You can manipulate it, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.934
So now I want you to feel how this stone
is different

21:50.101 --> 21:54.981
from others you've felt before,
but its internal structure. Can you?

21:55.440 --> 22:01.112
- I... I know it's a stone.
- But inside, it's intricate, complex.

22:01.321 --> 22:06.075
You know, parts hardened by pressure.
Hollowed by loss.

22:09.704 --> 22:10.913
I feel...

22:12.540 --> 22:13.583
gaps.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.169
Like, uh...

22:17.420 --> 22:21.007
like someone carved patterns
at a micro level.

22:22.216 --> 22:26.179
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah. That's right.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.348
- He's good at this.
- Yeah. So are you.

22:29.599 --> 22:32.101
It's a composite. We think,
mostly limestone.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.479
- I can't generate rock.
- Oh, no, that's okay.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.481
We know where to find plenty of limestone.

22:36.731 --> 22:39.108
Okay. But if it's a composite,
what about the rest?

22:39.776 --> 22:42.779
We have a plan for that.

22:43.196 --> 22:46.324
- They're coming. We got to move.
- Let's go!

22:47.200 --> 22:49.160
Hey, how are you with confined spaces?

22:49.577 --> 22:52.455
- I grew up in a tin can.
- Okay, good. What about vast ones?

22:55.375 --> 22:57.460
- Hey.
- Submit and avoid pain!

23:10.890 --> 23:13.351
- We got to run now.
- Yeah, let's go.

23:13.518 --> 23:14.852
This was your way out?

23:16.687 --> 23:20.316
Can't fight them all. The rest need
to be afraid to follow us.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.032
Whatever's coming, I'm not afraid
to hear it.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.660
Tell me how to fight.

23:31.536 --> 23:32.620
I want to.

23:33.871 --> 23:38.000
I want to help you fix the mistakes.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.920
I want to tell you something different
than last time.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.256
But the more I talk...

23:44.298 --> 23:47.760
the more I hear my words...
echo all over again.

23:47.927 --> 23:52.098
It's okay. Take it slow. Just tell me
what you remember.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.268
I remember feeling helpless.

23:56.144 --> 23:58.479
Not being able to change
people's choices.

24:00.523 --> 24:01.607
His choices.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.445
- Mack?
- No.

24:06.487 --> 24:07.655
Coulson.

24:10.908 --> 24:11.951
How we looking?

24:13.161 --> 24:15.413
Almost done.

24:19.917 --> 24:20.918
All set.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.171
Express train to the bottom
of the Lighthouse,

24:23.337 --> 24:25.715
- no stops.
- Right to the belly of the beast.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.718
Daisy, can't waste time.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.180
I'm not coming.

24:36.642 --> 24:40.188
- I know you're scared about going home.
- No, I'm terrified. Look around.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.231
Billions of people gone.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.818
If there's a chance I'm the cause...
I can't go.

24:46.152 --> 24:49.071
We can get through this together. You
don't even have your powers anymore...

24:49.238 --> 24:51.282
It's only a matter of time
and you know it.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.242
If there's an emergency or if one of you
are in danger,

24:53.409 --> 24:55.745
I will need them, and we will find a way.

24:55.912 --> 24:58.623
If I go through that portal, you know
it's the beginning of the end.

24:58.789 --> 25:02.001
- I don't.
- We made it back home, and we fought

25:02.168 --> 25:04.712
to save the world from a future
we knew was coming.

25:04.879 --> 25:07.340
- We have to fight.
- Of course...

25:07.840 --> 25:11.594
but the more we fought,
the closer it came.

25:12.470 --> 25:15.431
- We don't even know you did this.
- I was right in the epicentre.

25:15.598 --> 25:18.017
I won't let you sacrifice yourself
because you're scared of what's to come.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.229
What's to come is the end of everything.

25:21.395 --> 25:24.774
If you can change the future here,
you can change it from back home.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.985
But we know this solution works.
We can stop this today.

25:28.152 --> 25:30.738
No, it's not about today.
It's about tomorrow.

25:31.239 --> 25:36.827
Even if we solve this problem, the world
is never safe. The job goes on. We go on.

25:37.370 --> 25:40.831
The team makes one choice,
and it ruins everything.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.291
A choice to do what?

25:44.752 --> 25:46.379
- To save him.
- What do you mean?

25:46.837 --> 25:49.423
- Please.
- Maybe I don't go with you.

25:50.508 --> 25:51.968
You know it's the right move.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.888
Coulson, as an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D,
you trained me to fight.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.642
Now I'm making my stand here.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.937
May trained you to fight.

26:06.524 --> 26:08.317
I need you to lead.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.074
Phil Coulson is dying.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.369
And you have to let him.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.053
Coulson?

26:37.179 --> 26:38.472
How? How does he die?

26:40.099 --> 26:41.434
It's already begun.

26:42.518 --> 26:46.355
He's sick and he knows it.
We tried to stop it.

26:46.814 --> 26:50.067
Loyalty... it cost us the world.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.653
You heard all this
and still you couldn't change anything.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.865
I know. Stuck in the loop.

26:57.742 --> 26:59.910
But you can forge a different fu...

27:02.163 --> 27:03.873
Even as I say the words...

27:04.624 --> 27:06.751
I realise I've heard them before.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.753
Are you telling me to go back
and change the world

27:08.919 --> 27:10.630
or are you warning me that I can't?

27:10.796 --> 27:14.759
You need to go. They're coming.

27:14.925 --> 27:16.969
- No. Not yet.
- I hope you travel a path

27:17.136 --> 27:19.597
to a world I've never seen. Now go.

27:19.764 --> 27:24.352
- Not until you come with me!
- Go! This is not my path.

27:25.853 --> 27:28.230
Please! Please.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.483
Go now!

29:00.156 --> 29:03.033
<i>They were sweeping
the floor but never reported in.</i>

29:03.367 --> 29:06.996
<i>- We underestimated their strength, sir.
- Strength?</i>

29:07.246 --> 29:10.249
<i>They cut off their heads.
They must answer for it.</i>

29:11.333 --> 29:14.712
They have nowhere to run.
We have their ship.

29:15.755 --> 29:19.592
Next... we secure all of the trawlers,

29:19.800 --> 29:22.887
and squeeze the Terrans
until they drop at our feet.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.415
Let's go. You okay?

29:56.086 --> 29:58.172
Well... that worked.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.893
My last experience will be a new one.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.029
Where has this been all my life, right?

30:23.197 --> 30:27.409
- Level three, hidden in a wall cavity.
- Yeah, now you tell me.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.623
Well, that's not good.
What's it gonna take to fix you up?

30:32.873 --> 30:37.086
I think, at this point,
our efforts would be best spent...

30:38.295 --> 30:39.421
repairing that.

30:46.220 --> 30:48.973
You got this. Just concentrate.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.937
He's a bright kid.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.357
Sorry, I killed the guards
in front of him.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.610
Yeah. It's good to see him
building something.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.863
There's too much death in this place.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.825
And asking him to blow out that window
on the Krees didn't help.

31:08.033 --> 31:11.203
- Oh, that wasn't me. That was the fiancée.
- Ah.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.331
- Fiancée?
- Two.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.375
Okay.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.044
So, it's going to feel strange at first,

31:19.336 --> 31:22.172
- but your hearing will normalise.
- I can hear you.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.508
I can hear...

31:25.050 --> 31:26.302
my voice.

31:29.638 --> 31:30.639
What happened?

31:31.515 --> 31:34.602
- He iced her. She didn't want to come.
- I'm not leaving anyone behind.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.478
Where's Yo-Yo? She didn't find you?

31:38.647 --> 31:40.983
- She's not with you?
- No, she was picking up some survivors.

31:41.150 --> 31:44.069
- She should be back by now.
- She'll make it back. She's strong.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.699
Hurry. Who knows
when that portal's gonna open.

31:51.619 --> 31:54.705
- You're Flint?
- Yes.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.499
You're gonna get us home.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.669
Yes. I am.

32:01.712 --> 32:04.131
Good. What are you waiting for?

33:05.359 --> 33:06.485
Yo-Yo.

33:15.452 --> 33:18.288
- Let her go!
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

33:18.455 --> 33:19.957
Mack, no.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.712
Elena told me I'd find you here.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.592
Yo-Yo... what'd they do to you?

33:32.761 --> 33:34.847
I've gotten to know Elena quite well.

33:36.515 --> 33:41.103
- Pain can be so persuasive.
- Mack, run! Leave! Go home!

33:41.353 --> 33:43.897
I'm not leaving. I said let her go!

33:44.189 --> 33:45.816
Look at her tremble.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.445
Perhaps she knows what comes next
for you...

33:50.696 --> 33:52.614
for me, huh?

33:53.615 --> 33:59.830
For all of us here, standing on the edge
of timeless, violent glory.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.634
No! No! No!

34:38.786 --> 34:41.330
Take the Orchard! Slaughter the rest!

34:42.039 --> 34:43.248
It's not gonna happen.

35:12.820 --> 35:15.447
I'm gonna beat your body
with your own skull!

35:15.864 --> 35:18.617
Elena didn't deserve to die.

35:26.041 --> 35:29.128
Ow! Stop it! I'm trying to fix you!

35:29.378 --> 35:32.381
It does one thing, it opens a door.
You'd think they'd make it simple.

35:32.589 --> 35:37.302
I think this vessel is too damaged
to power the Monolith.

35:37.678 --> 35:38.762
Then what can?

35:40.347 --> 35:41.348
Me.

35:43.517 --> 35:48.522
My battery has sustained me
for more than 32,000 Earth years.

35:48.897 --> 35:52.401
Modifying the cell stack could create
a thermal feedback

35:52.568 --> 35:55.237
capable of delivering
more than enough power.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.781
Thermal feedback, what happens to you
in that scenario?

35:57.948 --> 36:02.452
I will expire, knowing,
I returned my friends home.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.955
And then my battery chemistry

36:05.122 --> 36:08.458
will consume my body
in an exothermal reaction

36:08.625 --> 36:11.920
violent enough to decimate several levels
of the Lighthouse.

36:12.921 --> 36:16.008
So, it's not great for the guy that's
standing next to you flipping the switch.

36:19.136 --> 36:20.220
That person...

36:21.180 --> 36:23.390
would be completely atomised.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.186
<i>Deke, come in.</i>

36:30.063 --> 36:31.732
I'm liking this plan less.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.525
<i>Yeah, we're here.</i>

36:33.734 --> 36:36.320
We got the Monolith built.
I think it might work.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.363
How's the machine coming?

36:41.116 --> 36:42.201
Yeah, all right.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.370
That's great. We found a fix
for the machine.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.080
Good. You were right
about taking the <i>Zephyr.</i>

36:47.581 --> 36:48.707
Just make sure everyone's in place

36:48.874 --> 36:50.250
the second we get it powered on,
all right?

36:50.417 --> 36:53.128
- We're only gonna get one shot at this.
- Right.

36:53.754 --> 36:56.131
You know, your parents would be proud
of you.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.508
I'll find out soon enough.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.598
Well, we're about to give them
a hell of a show.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.851
Thanks. We'll have everyone in place.

37:09.102 --> 37:12.147
That machine's going to explode.
It's not safe down here.

37:12.439 --> 37:13.440
What?

37:14.233 --> 37:17.361
You're welcome to come back with us,
but if not, you got to leave now.

37:17.527 --> 37:19.321
- Meet Tess at the trawler.
- Where? Which one?

37:19.488 --> 37:22.366
But Mack, Yo-Yo, they're not back yet.
I...

37:28.664 --> 37:30.290
Tell them I had more work to do.

37:31.708 --> 37:32.709
Come on.

37:34.127 --> 37:36.463
- I know the way.
- Thank you.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.800
- Coulson, what's happening?
- Where are they?

37:43.053 --> 37:44.638
There's nothing you can do to me.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.586
I want to watch the light die
in your eyes.

38:18.171 --> 38:21.675
My father will see me.
He will have his world!

38:22.175 --> 38:24.594
Not just the sliver Quake left behind.

38:27.347 --> 38:28.515
Silence.

39:01.923 --> 39:04.551
Yo-Yo... she...

39:12.267 --> 39:13.268
Mack.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.612
How? You were killed.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.113
Can't be.

39:25.280 --> 39:29.409
Oh. I'm so sorry, you had to see that.
It wasn't me.

39:31.912 --> 39:34.623
- But you were dead.
- No.

39:35.374 --> 39:36.458
I'm here.

39:38.293 --> 39:39.920
And it's time to go home.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.930
Just a few more.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.351
I will be offline sooner than anticipated.

39:56.645 --> 40:00.273
Far sooner.
You need to patch in immediately.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.567
Okay, okay. Just hang on.
We're going, we're going.

40:02.818 --> 40:03.652
Guys, we got a problem.

40:04.736 --> 40:05.487
What's wrong?

40:05.570 --> 40:08.782
I'm using Enoch to power the machine
but I'm losing him. You got to launch now.

40:08.949 --> 40:13.453
What? No, Deke, it's too early. The team
isn't back yet.

40:14.621 --> 40:15.664
<i>Enoch.</i>

40:17.499 --> 40:19.376
<i>Enoch, buddy, hang on.</i>

40:19.626 --> 40:22.963
I know that you've done so much already,
but, please, please, just hang on.

40:23.130 --> 40:24.923
Guys, I'm buying as much time
as I can here!

40:26.258 --> 40:29.761
- Let's go!
<i>- The rock's gonna open! Get here now!</i>

40:32.180 --> 40:34.349
I always knew that working with you guys
was gonna blow up in my face

40:34.433 --> 40:36.017
but it's about to get literal!

40:40.856 --> 40:42.983
Come on, buddy. Just hang together,
okay?

40:47.362 --> 40:49.531
You know she'll never forgive you, right?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.117
I have to hope.

40:54.244 --> 40:57.456
We're losing him! I'm out of time!

41:01.501 --> 41:03.628
Son of a bi...

41:16.850 --> 41:18.602
You sure, Deke didn't make it out?

41:19.936 --> 41:22.522
He would have been standing
right in the middle of that explosion.

41:24.232 --> 41:28.403
Maybe he at least got the rock open.
Some of them had to make it home.

41:28.945 --> 41:30.405
They made it back.

41:31.490 --> 41:32.616
I just know it.

41:35.285 --> 41:40.123
Well... in any case...
we got a second chance.

41:41.082 --> 41:43.084
Our friends from S.H.I.E.L.D.
gave us that, yeah?

41:46.630 --> 41:47.964
Clean slate.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.426
Future's up to us now.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.179
There's a lot that needs fixing.

41:55.805 --> 41:56.890
You're right.

41:58.391 --> 41:59.643
Here's your blueprint.
