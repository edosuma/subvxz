08:17.710 --> 08:19.329
Papa, can't you tell

08:19.330 --> 08:21.079
that this boy is an impostor?

08:21.080 --> 08:22.539
Tilly, I think I can tell

08:22.540 --> 08:23.959
who's my son and who isn't.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.669
Everyone, quick!
Cricket's in trouble,

08:25.670 --> 08:29.379
and... wait, you're--
you're Zillon Brax!

08:29.380 --> 08:33.329
What can I say?

08:33.330 --> 08:34.749
- I knew it!
- [Bill] Huh.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.749
I'm puttin' the pieces together,

08:36.750 --> 08:39.079
and it is clear now
that that is not my boy.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.709
Bill, Cricket's in trouble.

08:40.710 --> 08:42.879
He's been captured by one
of Zillon's crazy fan girls.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.499
What? How'd that happen?

08:44.500 --> 08:47.999
Well, uh... we kind of
used Cricket and Zillon's

08:48.000 --> 08:50.329
uncanny resemblance
to get free stuff.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.459
I can't believe it!

08:51.460 --> 08:53.169
How could you be
so thoughtless?!

08:53.170 --> 08:54.919
Seriously, Bill?
This coming from the guy

08:54.920 --> 08:56.879
who mistook a stranger
for his own son?

08:56.880 --> 08:58.539
- Touché.
- We can talk about

08:58.540 --> 09:00.879
how I'm the only
good parent here later!

09:00.880 --> 09:03.119
How are we gonna
find this girl
that took Cricket?

09:03.120 --> 09:05.459
He was probably
snatched up
by Amaryllis.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.419
She's always trying to
lure me to this creepy,

09:07.420 --> 09:09.039
abandoned mannequin warehouse.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.379
Well, what are we waitin' for?

09:10.380 --> 09:11.999

09:30.380 --> 09:32.879
but I'm beggin' ya!
I've learned my lesson.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.079
Maybe my real life
doesn't have everything,

09:35.080 --> 09:37.289
but I'd give anything
for it now.

09:37.290 --> 09:39.619
Zillon! You have to

You're not hurt, are ya?

10:16.210 --> 10:18.079
Oh, don't worry, Officer.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.289
You see, I tried
to capture Zillon,

10:20.290 --> 10:21.619
but I got the wrong one.

10:21.620 --> 10:25.419
You tried
to take away my Zillon?!

10:25.420 --> 10:27.169
You have to learn
that you can't just

10:27.170 --> 10:28.329
take a celebrity for yourself.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.419
They belong to all of us.

You know, living amongst
you simple folk

10:39.380 --> 10:40.669

to think about.

10:40.670 --> 10:42.329
But I don't like to think!

10:42.330 --> 10:44.579
So I'm just gonna go back
