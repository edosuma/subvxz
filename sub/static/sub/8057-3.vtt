WEBVTT

00:00.979 --> 00:02.278
Hey, there you are.

00:02.479 --> 00:04.279
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

00:04.781 --> 00:05.414
Where are you?

00:05.416 --> 00:07.249
I'm in my new city council office.

00:07.251 --> 00:08.750
- No way.
- I know, do you like it?

00:08.752 --> 00:09.751
I love it.

00:09.753 --> 00:11.486
I love it, too.
Check this out.

00:11.988 --> 00:14.756
Here is my wall of inspirational women.

00:15.993 --> 00:17.259
Is that a picture of you?

00:17.261 --> 00:18.794
Yes.
I am big enough to admit

00:18.796 --> 00:21.096
that I am often inspired by myself.

00:21.098 --> 00:24.265
Here are my clocks.
Pawnee and Washington D.C.

00:24.267 --> 00:25.333
Same time zone.

00:25.335 --> 00:26.695
This is the coolest part ever.

00:26.696 --> 00:29.068
I have my own private bathroom.

00:29.169 --> 00:30.068
Occupied!

00:30.069 --> 00:31.468
My God.

00:32.969 --> 00:33.968
Councilman Jamm.

00:34.069 --> 00:35.468
What are you doing in my bathroom?

00:35.519 --> 00:37.468
I don't known if I would call it
<i>your</i> bathroom.

00:37.968 --> 00:40.167
Its only door is in my office.

00:40.168 --> 00:44.071
I think it is crazy that
the most junior city councilor

00:44.073 --> 00:47.108
gets a private bathroom
just because she is a girl.

00:47.110 --> 00:49.744
- Excuse me?
- Let's solve this.

00:49.746 --> 00:50.946
Tell you what I'm going to do.

00:50.947 --> 00:52.880
I'm going to drop my liquids in here,

00:52.882 --> 00:54.315
take my solids down the hall.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.800
- Deal?
- No. No deal.

00:56.802 --> 00:59.270
Fine.
Your loss.

01:01.006 --> 01:02.106
How?

01:05.111 --> 01:09.711

01:22.294 --> 01:23.560
Fun fact about me.

01:23.562 --> 01:27.231
I recently began intensive psychotherapy.

01:27.383 --> 01:29.023
I may have mentioned that to you already.

01:29.024 --> 01:30.384
Several times.

01:30.386 --> 01:31.586
Well, like my therapist says,

01:31.588 --> 01:33.522
"You can't share too much
or too often."

01:33.523 --> 01:35.523
You know, Gayle and I,
we saw a couples therapist

01:35.524 --> 01:37.284
for a little while.
That's too much, Jerry.

01:37.286 --> 01:38.726
For real.
Keep us out your bedroom.

01:38.727 --> 01:39.287
It used to be,

01:39.288 --> 01:40.728
when I was down, I called my mother.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.531
When I lacked self-confidence,
I called my running coach.

01:43.533 --> 01:46.367
And now, no matter
what emotion I'm feeling,

01:46.369 --> 01:49.303
I call one number...
my therapist.

01:49.305 --> 01:51.973
I want to do the same thing for the city.

01:51.975 --> 01:53.975
A psychotherapist for the city.

01:53.977 --> 01:54.976
No, Andy.

01:54.978 --> 01:56.310
- No.
- A 311 line.

01:56.312 --> 02:00.548
Citizens will call 311
for whatever problem they have.

02:00.550 --> 02:03.117
Uncollected garbage, broken streetlight,

02:03.119 --> 02:06.187
and we will direct them
to the proper department.

02:06.189 --> 02:07.655
Chris, great idea.

02:07.657 --> 02:08.889
Thank you, Andy.
I agree.

02:08.890 --> 02:09.924
I love this idea.

02:09.925 --> 02:12.026
And I love me for thinking of it.

02:12.028 --> 02:13.908
My therapist said that
I need to be more vocal

02:13.909 --> 02:14.949
about appreciating myself.

02:14.950 --> 02:16.364
Thank you, Chris.

02:16.366 --> 02:18.432
You're welcome, Chris.

02:18.434 --> 02:20.167
I sound insane.

02:20.169 --> 02:21.649
I'm going to go talk to my therapist.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.170
Welcome to <i>Pawnee Today.</i>

02:23.172 --> 02:26.173
I am first-rate newswoman
Joan Callamezzo.

02:26.175 --> 02:30.911
Pawnee's City Council
approval rate is at a dismal 3%.

02:30.913 --> 02:33.014
That's an all-time low.
Yuck.

02:33.016 --> 02:35.883
Leslie, the city council
has done very little

02:35.885 --> 02:37.418
over the past few years,

02:37.420 --> 02:39.387
and what they have accomplished,

02:39.389 --> 02:41.622
in my opinion, has been embarrassing.

02:41.624 --> 02:42.623
And that is a fact.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.525
No, that's your opinion.

02:44.527 --> 02:45.967
That's the definition of an opinion.

02:45.968 --> 02:48.396
Well, that's your opinion.

02:48.398 --> 02:51.232
The city council
has some political gridlock

02:51.234 --> 02:52.466
and some partisan bickering,

02:52.468 --> 02:54.301
but we're actually about to pass a bill...

02:54.303 --> 02:55.302
my bill...

02:55.304 --> 02:56.904
the Leslie Knope Fun In The Sun Act,

02:56.906 --> 02:59.907
which will extend
public pool hours citywide.

03:01.709 --> 03:03.177
Can you say, "big whoop"?

03:03.179 --> 03:05.913
Recently, the Captain of
the Pawnee Porpoises swim team

03:05.915 --> 03:08.616
asked me if we could keep
the public pools open longer

03:08.618 --> 03:10.418
so they could log more practice time,

03:10.420 --> 03:12.386
and I said, "Absolutely."

03:12.388 --> 03:14.388
Because not only am I a city councilor.

03:14.390 --> 03:16.891
I'm a city councilor with <i>porpoise.</i>

03:18.127 --> 03:21.295
By passing the bill,
and extending pool hours,

03:21.297 --> 03:24.498
we are saying to our citizens
that this City Council

03:24.500 --> 03:26.967
is determined to better our town.

03:26.969 --> 03:29.163
Okay, Pawnee Porpoises youth swim team,

03:29.164 --> 03:30.204
I have a question for you.

03:30.206 --> 03:31.686
What is your greatest accomplishment?

03:31.687 --> 03:33.081
We came in fourth

03:33.082 --> 03:34.442
in the County swim meet last year.

03:34.444 --> 03:36.110
Wrong, your greatest accomplishment

03:36.112 --> 03:39.046
is happening in two hours
when this bill becomes law.

03:39.048 --> 03:40.581
Yay.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.503
I just want you to be
very proud of yourselves,

03:42.504 --> 03:44.746
because this bill is going
to start a long romance

03:44.747 --> 03:46.187
between the city and its government.

03:46.189 --> 03:49.857
Porpoise call!

03:53.563 --> 03:54.549
What are you doing?

03:54.550 --> 03:56.430
I'm doing a porpoise call,
which we used to do

03:56.431 --> 03:57.631
when I was part of your group,

03:57.632 --> 03:59.312
but it seems like you don't do it any more

03:59.313 --> 03:59.953
and that's fine.

03:59.955 --> 04:01.475
I'm not weird.
Okay, everybody leave.

04:01.476 --> 04:03.838
I'll see you at the city council meeting.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.473
Hey, are you busy?

04:05.475 --> 04:07.675
And writing <i>Star Trek</i>
fan fiction does not count.

04:07.677 --> 04:08.876
Ha ha ha.

04:08.878 --> 04:11.545
I... finished it last week.
What's going on?

04:11.547 --> 04:13.714
I miss Andy.

04:13.716 --> 04:15.750
And you probably miss your lover, Chris.

04:15.752 --> 04:16.851
Leslie.

04:16.853 --> 04:18.017
I had an idea.
It's Friday.

04:18.019 --> 04:19.987
Pawnee's only a ten-hour drive.
Road trip?

04:19.988 --> 04:22.029
I don't know,
I was going to try to get a jump

04:22.029 --> 04:23.591
on some work this weekend.

04:23.593 --> 04:24.553
Dude, 30 years from now,

04:24.554 --> 04:27.034
when you're on your deathbed,
what are you going to remember?

04:27.035 --> 04:29.263
Organizing files or taking
a spontaneous road trip

04:29.265 --> 04:30.498
to surprise Leslie?

04:30.500 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, you know what?
All right, I'm in.

04:33.002 --> 04:35.970
You know, we might be able
to sneak out early.

04:35.972 --> 04:37.805
You get snacks.
I'll bring music.

04:37.807 --> 04:39.373
We'll jam out to some sweet tunage.

04:39.375 --> 04:40.655
You know what?
This is awesome.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.610
Actually, no.
I don't want to go any more.

04:42.612 --> 04:44.612
Okay.

04:44.614 --> 04:46.134
Just kidding.
See you in ten minutes.

04:46.135 --> 04:47.047
Okay.

04:47.049 --> 04:49.784
Just kidding.
We're not going.

04:49.786 --> 04:50.785
Road trip!

04:50.787 --> 04:51.786
So we're going?

04:51.788 --> 04:53.254
Yes!

04:53.256 --> 04:55.623
I'm excited to bond a little with April.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.291
She's like the little sister I never had.

04:57.293 --> 04:59.693
Because the little sister I do have

04:59.695 --> 05:02.730
is normal and not terrifying.

05:08.069 --> 05:11.032
- 311.
- Well, Diane, for potholes,

05:11.033 --> 05:12.473
you want to speak with Public Works.

05:13.876 --> 05:16.043
I understand you've tried them four times.

05:16.045 --> 05:18.546
Government is inefficient
and should be dissolved.

05:18.548 --> 05:20.514
Please hold while I transfer you.

05:20.516 --> 05:21.849
Donna, can you help me?

05:21.851 --> 05:24.618
I got a 311 call, but it was all static.

05:24.620 --> 05:26.153
That sounds like
an I.T. Problem.

05:26.155 --> 05:27.421
Well, how do I
get I.T. Here?

05:27.423 --> 05:29.590
Call 311.

05:30.092 --> 05:32.927
311, how can I...

05:32.929 --> 05:35.029
Hello again, Diane.

05:35.031 --> 05:37.498
Nobody answered?

05:37.500 --> 05:38.499
Okay, you know what?

05:38.501 --> 05:40.734
Someone will be there shortly.

05:40.736 --> 05:42.903
Andrew, get your lunch, some water,

05:42.905 --> 05:44.772
and a 40-pound bag
of asphalt.

05:44.774 --> 05:46.014
Okay, boss.
What are we doing?

05:46.016 --> 05:47.336
- We're fixing a pothole.
- Hey!

05:50.112 --> 05:53.247
Pawnee 311.
How can I help...

05:53.249 --> 05:54.715
No.
No, this is not 911.

05:54.717 --> 05:55.850
No, no.
This is 311.

05:55.852 --> 05:58.485
Donna, they switched my phone with 911.

05:58.487 --> 05:59.687
What do I do?

05:59.689 --> 06:00.921
I don't know.
Try to help.

06:00.923 --> 06:01.922
Now hush.

06:01.924 --> 06:04.091
It is heating up in this piece.

06:04.093 --> 06:05.259
That sounds awful.

06:05.261 --> 06:07.928
Good lord, it is hot.

06:07.930 --> 06:09.330
Yes, mercy me.

06:09.332 --> 06:10.698
Living in this town's like living

06:10.700 --> 06:11.866
in the devil's butt crack.

06:11.868 --> 06:13.934
Almost out of gas.

06:13.936 --> 06:16.036
I'll wait till we're on the highway.

06:16.038 --> 06:20.215
Now, the GPS says
we should take 495 to 270,

06:20.216 --> 06:22.176
but check out this
cool alternate route I fou...

06:22.178 --> 06:23.978
My God, that is so interesting to me

06:23.980 --> 06:25.813
because I'm a map salesman.

06:25.815 --> 06:27.314
Why aren't we moving?

06:27.316 --> 06:29.383
Because.
Other cars.

06:30.179 --> 06:31.619
Will you not do that?
Please don't.

06:31.621 --> 06:32.953
That's what you do when you...

06:32.955 --> 06:35.155
Please don't do...
Great, here comes a guy.

06:35.157 --> 06:36.891
Excuse me.

06:36.893 --> 06:38.933
- Why aren't we moving?
- Exit's closed for a bit.

06:38.934 --> 06:39.854
Presidential motorcade.

06:39.855 --> 06:44.465
I'll just shut off the car
till it opens up.

06:48.203 --> 06:50.037
Holy, it's hot.

06:52.374 --> 06:54.141
Yeah, yeah.

06:54.143 --> 06:55.910
Beautiful, Tom.
Beautiful.

06:55.912 --> 06:58.178
- Dynamite gums.
- Aw, thanks.

06:58.180 --> 07:00.848
Tom, do you want to know
why I moved to Pawnee?

07:00.850 --> 07:02.116
Sure.

07:02.118 --> 07:03.918
It's because
the two leading industries here

07:03.919 --> 07:05.819
are corn syrup and rubber nipples.

07:05.821 --> 07:09.356
It is a dentistry jackpot.
It's genius, right?

07:09.358 --> 07:11.478
Well, D.D.S. Doesn't stand
for "dumb, dumb, stupid."

07:12.960 --> 07:14.595
I like that.

07:14.597 --> 07:16.230
I'm going to steal it.
That's mine now.

07:16.232 --> 07:17.531
All right. Cool.

07:17.533 --> 07:19.566
Councilman Jamm and I
have gotten pretty tight.

07:19.568 --> 07:21.902
And I'm hoping to parlay this
into a membership

07:21.904 --> 07:23.237
at the Pawnee Smokehouse,

07:23.239 --> 07:26.407
Pawnee's most exclusive cigar club.

07:26.409 --> 07:29.076
Overstuffed leather chairs,
top-shelf brandies.

07:29.078 --> 07:32.346
And that stale tobacco stench that says,

07:32.348 --> 07:34.248
"Welcome to the top."

07:34.250 --> 07:36.951
You're a member
of the Pawnee Smokehouse, right?

07:36.953 --> 07:39.219
- Yeah.
- Man, I love a good stogie.

07:39.221 --> 07:42.756
I actually just had this
personalized cigar cutter made.

07:42.758 --> 07:44.024
Whoa.

07:44.026 --> 07:45.259
Real nice.

07:45.261 --> 07:48.128
Not my initials, but thank you so much.

07:48.130 --> 07:49.530
Well, it's not...

07:49.532 --> 07:51.098
Okay.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.633
Hey, so, uh, we're still all good

07:52.635 --> 07:53.867
on Leslie's bill, right?

07:54.369 --> 07:57.638
Actually, Tommy, we need to talk.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.773
I have wanted this perm
since middle school.

07:59.775 --> 08:01.335
I could not be more excited about this.

08:01.336 --> 08:03.377
- Are you excited, Autumn?
- Yeah, definitely.

08:03.379 --> 08:06.747
Do you ever give a perm
to someone and ever regret it?

08:08.617 --> 08:11.285
Ann has told me repeatedly
not to get a perm.

08:11.287 --> 08:12.486
But Ann's not here.

08:12.488 --> 08:16.390
So when the Ann's away,
the mice get perms.

08:17.625 --> 08:20.060
Councilman Jamm changed his vote.

08:20.062 --> 08:21.382
He's voting no on fun in the sun.

08:21.383 --> 08:23.497
What? Why?
He promised me.

08:23.499 --> 08:25.366
He just said that he changed his mind.

08:25.368 --> 08:27.808
Then he told me some veneers
could really make my smile pop.

08:27.809 --> 08:28.802
Thoughts?

08:28.804 --> 08:30.244
My God.
The vote is in an hour.

08:30.245 --> 08:32.773
Okay, we need to have an
emergency strategy session now.

08:32.775 --> 08:35.609
- What about the perm?
- The perm must wait, Autumn!

08:35.611 --> 08:38.611
The perm must wait.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.900
Wait... So this means the bill
isn't going to pass?

08:43.003 --> 08:45.502
My parents said that you guys
can't get anything done.

08:45.804 --> 08:46.870
Now, wait, okay, hold on.

08:46.872 --> 08:48.438
This isn't over by a long shot.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.274
But it's three to two against us.

08:50.276 --> 08:51.676
Yeah, I know how to do math, Mason.

08:51.677 --> 08:53.010
Okay, don't be an alarmist.

08:53.012 --> 08:54.692
It's very important that we stay positive.

08:54.693 --> 08:56.780
Our positive attitude
is our greatest asset.

08:56.782 --> 08:58.102
Tom, a word, please.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.864
The bill is dead,
the Porpoises are doomed,

08:59.865 --> 09:01.635
and democracy is over.
My God.

09:01.637 --> 09:03.904
I can't believe I decided to get a perm.

09:03.906 --> 09:05.773
Ann should have never let me do this.

09:05.775 --> 09:07.374
Look, Jamm saw you on <i>Pawnee Today.</i>

09:07.376 --> 09:08.736
He knows how much you want this.

09:08.737 --> 09:10.537
He's just trying to get
something in return.

09:10.538 --> 09:11.578
This is a bargaining tool.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.580
You know, this is why
people hate the government.

09:13.581 --> 09:15.901
'Cause just when we're about
to do something really good,

09:15.902 --> 09:17.818
it all falls apart due to some stupid,

09:17.820 --> 09:19.653
selfish jerk butt.

09:19.655 --> 09:21.956
You know, screw Jamm.
Screw Jamm.

09:21.958 --> 09:24.158
I'm just going to try
to get Councilman Milton's vote.

09:24.159 --> 09:25.592
Milton?
He's, like, 150 years old.

09:25.594 --> 09:27.394
Yeah.
He's got grandkids, okay?

09:27.396 --> 09:28.696
And... and kids love to swim.

09:28.698 --> 09:29.778
And he'll give us his vote.

09:29.779 --> 09:30.539
He's an old person,

09:30.540 --> 09:31.940
and I'll talk to him really slowly.

09:31.942 --> 09:33.342
He won't even know what he's doing.

09:33.343 --> 09:36.070
I just need to hurry up.
How do I look?

09:36.072 --> 09:38.572
I don't know how to answer that.

09:40.942 --> 09:42.843
Hi, I'm Andy.
I really like your dress.

09:42.845 --> 09:45.446
- I'm a princess.
- I'm a mermaid.

09:45.448 --> 09:47.581
I'm the director of Parks and Recreation.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.183
I'm here to fix that hole.

09:49.185 --> 09:51.852
This is our kingdom.
You have to ask permission.

09:51.854 --> 09:53.420
Excuse me?

09:53.422 --> 09:55.255
Your highnesses,

09:55.257 --> 09:58.792
we do humbly request thine permission

09:58.794 --> 10:01.195
to befix doth holes yonder.

10:01.197 --> 10:02.696
Only if you can tag us.

10:02.698 --> 10:03.697
Come here.

10:05.467 --> 10:08.469
Your tax dollars at work.

10:09.471 --> 10:11.672
Soundtrack to <i>Pulp Fiction,</i>

10:11.674 --> 10:13.374
soundtrack to <i>Singles,</i>

10:13.376 --> 10:15.209
soundtrack to <i>Grosse Pointe Blank.</i>

10:15.211 --> 10:16.651
Why do you have so many soundtracks?

10:16.652 --> 10:17.277
Well, uh,

10:17.279 --> 10:18.626
I kind of look at it like

10:18.627 --> 10:19.747
it's your favorite directors

10:19.749 --> 10:21.215
making a mix tape just for you.

10:21.217 --> 10:23.117
Eww.

10:23.869 --> 10:24.718
Here's something.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.459
"Benji's Cool Times
Summer Jamz Mix."

10:27.460 --> 10:29.780
No, I... you probably
don't want to listen to that...

10:29.781 --> 10:32.421
- Yes, I want to listen to it.
- Just 'cause... no, listen, it...

10:32.422 --> 10:34.502
- I want to listen to it.
- We don't... we don't...

10:34.503 --> 10:36.543
- I wanna hear what's on it.
- We don't need to...

10:44.313 --> 10:45.739
Don't judge me.

10:45.741 --> 10:47.141
Councilman, I'd like to talk to you

10:47.142 --> 10:48.423
about the Fun In The Sun bill,

10:48.424 --> 10:50.744
and I don't mean to rush you,
but the vote is in an hour.

10:50.746 --> 10:53.914
When I'm done eating, we'll talk.

10:53.916 --> 10:56.016
I've eaten the same lunch for 58 years.

10:56.018 --> 10:59.453
Caesar salad, extra dressing,

10:59.455 --> 11:03.390
extra croutons, and extra anchovies.

11:03.392 --> 11:04.892
Mmm.

11:04.894 --> 11:07.361
Councilman Milton was first
elected as a city councilor

11:07.363 --> 11:11.131
in 1948, as a member
of the Dixiecrat Party.

11:11.133 --> 11:14.701
Their platform?
"De-integrate Baseball."

11:14.703 --> 11:16.770
The secret is in the dressing.

11:16.772 --> 11:21.608
Try it.
It's an aphrodisiac.

11:21.610 --> 11:24.111
You too, my strange, foreign friend.

11:24.113 --> 11:26.013
- No, thank you.
- Tom, eat some.

11:26.015 --> 11:28.415
I'm not eating racist salad.

11:28.417 --> 11:31.685
The more we eat, the faster we talk.

11:35.957 --> 11:37.624
Mmm.

11:37.626 --> 11:39.193
You can really taste the ignorance.

11:39.695 --> 11:41.595
It's pronounced
"anchovies."

11:45.066 --> 11:46.006
Hi.

11:46.068 --> 11:46.633
Diane Lewis.

11:47.135 --> 11:48.135
I own this pothole.

11:48.137 --> 11:50.437
Ron Swanson.
I'm here to fix it.

11:50.439 --> 11:53.907
Seaweed choke!

11:53.909 --> 11:56.510
That large boy is my colleague.

11:56.512 --> 11:58.445
We work at the Parks Department.

11:58.447 --> 12:01.281
You're not even from
the Public Works Department?

12:01.283 --> 12:03.483
Look, it appeared that no one
from the proper channels

12:03.484 --> 12:05.786
was gonna fix this,
so I decided to do it myself.

12:05.788 --> 12:07.387
Do you know what you're doing?

12:08.689 --> 12:09.890
Yes, ma'am.

12:09.892 --> 12:12.159
Yes, I do.

12:12.461 --> 12:14.261
Councilman, you have grandchildren...

12:14.263 --> 12:16.063
And seven great-grandkids.

12:16.565 --> 12:19.733
Tim, Mary, Jack,

12:19.735 --> 12:23.704
uh, Tim, Marie, Tim, and Mary.

12:23.756 --> 12:24.821
Don't forget about Tim.

12:24.823 --> 12:26.223
Right, Tim.

12:26.475 --> 12:27.741
How many is that?

12:27.743 --> 12:31.278
You know, it's very hard to tell.

12:31.330 --> 12:32.562
This might not work.

12:32.564 --> 12:34.124
Let me find Jamm, see if he'll bargain.

12:34.983 --> 12:37.117
What country is he from?

12:37.119 --> 12:38.535
Iceland.

12:38.537 --> 12:40.937
"Data had never felt this way before.

12:40.939 --> 12:43.573
"Of course, data had never
felt anything before.

12:43.575 --> 12:46.042
"But Captain Picard couldn't help but note

his mechanical
but lifelike face."

12:50.282 --> 12:51.415
I'm gonna murder you.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.450
I understand.
Just one second.

12:53.452 --> 12:56.453
"As they walked down the hall

13:03.094 --> 13:04.694

13:04.696 --> 13:06.797
Please and thank you.

13:06.799 --> 13:08.932
Hey, I'm sorry if I was curt earlier.

13:08.934 --> 13:10.454
I'm a single mom, and sometimes things

13:10.455 --> 13:11.701
get chaotic around here.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.623
When you showed up
from the Parks Department...

13:13.624 --> 13:16.273
No need to apologize.
I understand completely.

13:16.275 --> 13:17.474
This is delicious.

13:17.476 --> 13:19.409
Well, I got it from Food and Stuff, so...

13:19.411 --> 13:20.911
That's where I got these gloves.

13:20.913 --> 13:22.612
Right?

13:22.614 --> 13:25.549
So, how exactly are you
gonna fix this hole?

13:25.551 --> 13:28.752
Just for my own edification.

13:28.754 --> 13:31.688
I dug the loose gravel out of the hole.

13:31.690 --> 13:34.591
Now I'm using a jackhammer
to remove the larger pieces,

13:34.593 --> 13:37.694
then I'll spray down
the hole to settle the dust

13:37.696 --> 13:40.931
and fill it with cold patch asphalt.

13:40.933 --> 13:42.232
Well, thank you.

13:42.234 --> 13:46.069
Now I can fix the next one myself.

Jamm!

13:56.548 --> 13:59.149
Support of one of your bills?
Committee chairmanship?

13:59.151 --> 14:01.251
- I want your toilet.
- What?

14:01.253 --> 14:03.353
Your office, with the private bathroom?

14:03.355 --> 14:04.554
He wants your office.

14:04.556 --> 14:06.223
Yeah, I don't mean to brag, but, uh,

14:06.225 --> 14:08.325
I've got Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

14:08.327 --> 14:09.526
This isn't even about policy?

14:09.528 --> 14:11.361
- Absolutely not.
- This is a no-brainer.

14:11.363 --> 14:13.430
Just make the trade, everyone's happy.

14:13.432 --> 14:14.764
I'm not happy.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.307
He shoots down a very helpful bill

14:16.308 --> 14:18.268
'cause he doesn't get to poop
wherever he wants?

14:18.270 --> 14:20.770
No, I'm gonna get Councilman Milton,

14:20.772 --> 14:23.673
and you can put your butt
back in your pants, sir.

14:23.675 --> 14:26.610
Yeah, well, love the hair!

14:29.681 --> 14:31.214
Andy, come help me tamp this down.

14:31.216 --> 14:32.349
For the last time,

14:32.351 --> 14:34.618
Ron, it's princess rainbow sparkle.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.119
Holy Moses.

14:36.121 --> 14:38.121
Can we turn you into a princess?

14:38.123 --> 14:39.990
No.

14:39.992 --> 14:41.632
I think it would really make Diane happy.

14:41.633 --> 14:43.894
Why would that matter?

14:43.896 --> 14:45.028
Shut up.

14:46.298 --> 14:48.138
Would you please
come help me tamp this down?

14:48.139 --> 14:49.966
It's a job that requires two <i>men.</i>

14:49.968 --> 14:53.303
Or does it require two princesses?

14:53.305 --> 14:54.938
Please?
Please? Please?

14:56.074 --> 14:58.441
This is impressive.

14:58.443 --> 15:01.811
You remind me of a young,
beautiful Strom Thurmond.

15:01.813 --> 15:04.915
Yes, I've been saying that for years.

15:04.917 --> 15:06.816
Councilman Milton, do I have your vote?

15:06.818 --> 15:09.019
Yes, indeed.

15:09.021 --> 15:11.288
There's a lot of
salad dressing on your hand.

15:11.290 --> 15:12.355
Shall we kiss?

15:12.357 --> 15:13.557
No. No!

15:14.927 --> 15:16.647
My God, are you okay?

15:16.648 --> 15:17.694
Please be okay.

15:17.696 --> 15:19.095
Please, still be able to vote.

15:19.097 --> 15:20.230
We can kiss if you want to.

15:20.232 --> 15:21.665
With tongue?

15:21.667 --> 15:22.732
Hey! No.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.900
She tried to kiss me.

15:26.007 --> 15:27.608
She was insatiable.

15:27.610 --> 15:29.490
Well, I don't know,
maybe we should, you know,

15:29.491 --> 15:30.244
postpone the vote

15:30.296 --> 15:32.212
until the councilman
gets better, you know?

15:32.214 --> 15:34.615
Yeah, we're not postponing anything, okay?

15:34.617 --> 15:36.537
I'm pushing the vote through
and it won't pass.

15:36.952 --> 15:38.552
Complimentary toothbrush?

15:38.554 --> 15:40.474
You're missing the backs
of your upper canines.

15:40.475 --> 15:41.388
Sloppy technique.

15:41.390 --> 15:42.422
Excuse me?

15:42.424 --> 15:44.325
I have excellent toothbrush technique.

15:44.327 --> 15:46.593
Just give him what he wants.
Take the easy way out.

15:46.595 --> 15:48.595
I always do.
It's so easy.

15:48.597 --> 15:50.866
I do not negotiate with dentists.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.227
I'm trying to tell everybody
that the government is great,

15:53.228 --> 15:54.108
and I think it stinks.

15:54.109 --> 15:55.469
I hate it.
I hate the government.

15:55.471 --> 15:57.438
- You don't mean that.
- You're right, I don't.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.080
I take it back.
Why did I say that, Tom?

15:59.081 --> 16:00.174
God, you know me so well.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.775
More Rouge!

16:01.777 --> 16:04.611
Everything going good?

16:08.190 --> 16:09.350
I came here to fix a pothole,

16:09.352 --> 16:10.617
not be mocked.

16:10.619 --> 16:12.920
I'm sorry, it's just...
your face is ridiculous.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.857
Thank you for the lemonade.

16:16.859 --> 16:18.692
The asphalt will bear weight in an hour.

16:18.694 --> 16:19.960
- Time to go, Andrew.
- No!

16:19.962 --> 16:21.842
Wait, but we were gonna make
a sparkle palace!

16:21.843 --> 16:23.297
Ron, you're walking across hot lava!

16:23.299 --> 16:25.299
No!

16:28.970 --> 16:30.604
Whoa, it's moving.

16:30.606 --> 16:33.407
- It's moving.
- What?

16:33.409 --> 16:36.710
- Yes!
- Finally.

16:38.647 --> 16:41.315
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

16:41.317 --> 16:42.783
- What?
- No!

16:43.385 --> 16:44.351
We're out of gas.

16:49.858 --> 16:51.191
Next order of business,

16:51.193 --> 16:53.060
the Fun In The Sun Act,

16:53.062 --> 16:54.528
introduced by Councilwoman Knope.

16:58.620 --> 16:59.900
Councilman, I move that the bill

16:59.902 --> 17:01.668
be read in its entirety.

17:01.670 --> 17:05.973
- Ms. Beavers?
- Fine.

17:05.974 --> 17:08.942
Pawnee Municipal Code
Amendment, 217-426...

17:08.944 --> 17:10.977
Buying time, I see.
What's up?

17:11.229 --> 17:12.679
You can have my office.

17:12.681 --> 17:16.450
Okay, why don't you, uh...
why don't you sweeten the pot?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.050
You can have my parking space.

17:18.553 --> 17:19.653
And?

17:19.655 --> 17:22.156
And I will get Invisaligns from you.

17:22.558 --> 17:23.490
And?

17:23.492 --> 17:25.092
And, that is enough.

17:25.094 --> 17:26.359
And shut up.
And I hate you.

17:26.862 --> 17:27.998
We got a deal.

17:28.030 --> 17:30.998
Can't wait to drop my kids at the pool.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.567
- By "kids," I mean turds.
- I get it.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.101
Yeah.

17:35.103 --> 17:38.038
Then Ana asks Grey to punish her.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.480
Donna, please, can you keep it down?

17:39.481 --> 17:40.824
Or at least research

17:40.826 --> 17:43.326
how to deliver a baby
that's coming out face up.

17:43.328 --> 17:44.402
Lay the mother on her side

17:44.403 --> 17:46.363
and try to move the baby
in a corkscrew fashion.

17:46.365 --> 17:49.466
Diane is awesome and she likes you.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.334
And you like her.
I can tell.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.437
"A," I don't recall inviting you in here,

17:53.439 --> 17:55.038
and "B," I did not like her.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.206
She's not my type.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.809
Her life is messy.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.844
Ron, messy is fun, okay?

18:00.846 --> 18:02.713
My whole life is a giant mess

18:02.715 --> 18:03.847
and I love it.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.215
I mean, look at my hair.

18:05.217 --> 18:06.616
I have gum in my hair.

18:06.618 --> 18:09.019
Listen, I will not pursue Diane.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.388
End of story.

18:11.390 --> 18:14.357
- Please, just steer.
- Be stronger.

18:16.828 --> 18:18.628
That was a great road trip.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.897
We made it 40 feet.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.739
Yeah, well, at least
it took a million hours,

18:22.740 --> 18:23.700
and it was 180 degrees,

18:23.702 --> 18:25.802
- and we starved to death.
- So fun.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.008
Hey, how about next weekend
we fly to Pawnee?

18:32.010 --> 18:35.011
- Tickets are on me.
- Really?

18:35.013 --> 18:37.013
That would be awesome.
Definitely.

18:37.015 --> 18:40.450
Nah, never mind.
I don't feel like it.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.818
What?
My God.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.654
See how it feels?

18:44.656 --> 18:47.357
Excellent work, everyone!

18:47.359 --> 18:48.892
Particularly you, Ron.

18:49.144 --> 18:51.177
You have one very satisfied citizen.

18:51.179 --> 18:52.312
What did you do for her?

18:52.314 --> 18:53.780
I fixed her pothole.

18:53.782 --> 18:55.181
Is that a euphemism?

18:55.233 --> 18:57.234
- No.
- Then great work.

18:57.236 --> 18:58.556
In fact, she's out in the hallway

18:58.557 --> 19:01.972
and wants to thank you herself.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.241
If you're here
to complain about the pothole,

19:04.243 --> 19:06.243
I guarantee I did it correctly.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.378
Actually, I'm here
to ask you out for dinner.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.546
Really?

19:09.548 --> 19:11.281
Well, I hope you're not the kind of man

19:11.283 --> 19:12.849
who needs to ask the lady out.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.291
I'm a middle school
vice-principal.

19:14.292 --> 19:17.654
I don't screw around.
Does that freak you out?

19:17.656 --> 19:19.289
No, on the contrary.

19:19.791 --> 19:21.625
So, dinner?

19:21.627 --> 19:23.226
Please and thank you.

19:23.228 --> 19:24.661
Well, it'll be casual.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.764
No need to wear makeup.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.766
I begrudgingly admit

19:29.768 --> 19:33.770
that the 311 program
is a moderate success.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.038
I'm still not sure why

19:35.040 --> 19:38.975
the citizen decided to come
speak with me in person,

19:38.977 --> 19:40.777
but I'm just happy to see

19:40.779 --> 19:43.780
a government program finally work.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.740
Okay, so let's get ready
for the photo, guys.

19:47.741 --> 19:49.319
I want you to arrange yourselves

19:49.321 --> 19:52.155
from most excited about
democracy to least excited.

19:52.157 --> 19:53.597
Wait a minute.
Everybody's excited?

19:53.598 --> 19:54.925
I bet you are!

19:54.927 --> 19:59.090
Because your bill just became law.

19:59.091 --> 20:01.251
Boy, you know, I can't believe
you traded your office

20:01.252 --> 20:02.492
to keep this craphole pool open

20:02.493 --> 20:03.733
for a couple more weeks a year.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.975
Hey, can you not say that
in front of the kids, please?

20:05.977 --> 20:07.977
I'm trying to teach them
how great government is.

20:07.978 --> 20:09.178
This is a teaching moment?

20:09.179 --> 20:11.491
Great.
Hey, uh, kids?

20:11.493 --> 20:14.761
Would you like to learn
how Leslie got your bill passed?

20:14.813 --> 20:17.314
Councilwoman Knope
traded my vote for her...

20:20.692 --> 20:22.252
What the hell, man?
Why'd you do that?

20:23.822 --> 20:28.258
Because it's fun in the sun!

20:28.260 --> 20:30.927
Everybody in the pool!

20:30.929 --> 20:33.830
Yay, pool!

20:33.832 --> 20:35.932
Yay, democracy!

20:35.934 --> 20:36.933
No, my perm.

20:39.002 --> 20:40.769
Ta da.
What do you see?

20:41.221 --> 20:43.388
- Your new city council office.
- Yes.

20:43.390 --> 20:44.889
And it is across the courtyard

20:44.891 --> 20:48.226
from your office,
so we can wave at each other.

20:48.228 --> 20:50.528
But it is also Pawnee's
newest and most exclusive

20:50.530 --> 20:54.165
cigar club, Tom's Smokehouse.

20:54.167 --> 20:56.134
Whoa! "Smoke Dog."

20:56.136 --> 21:00.338
And the Tommy Haverford member's chair.

21:00.340 --> 21:01.840
Now you're talking.

21:01.842 --> 21:04.309
Man, Jamm's gotta be pretty mad at us.

21:04.361 --> 21:05.460
I ain't scared of him.

21:05.462 --> 21:07.562
He's a punk.

21:07.564 --> 21:08.764
To making things happen.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.300
I'll puff to that.

21:17.239 --> 21:18.874
I do not like this.

21:19.076 --> 21:23.658
