00:38.969 --> 00:40.428
"Wet cement."

00:40.638 --> 00:44.700
Is there any sweeter sign?
Well, maybe "high voltage."

00:48.687 --> 00:52.519
Hello, son. You want to try
this flying motorcycle I just invented?

00:52.691 --> 00:54.850
- No time.
- Okay.

00:57.112 --> 01:00.300
This is for the ages.

01:01.742 --> 01:04.778
Like Stonehenge,
this site will forever be a mystery.

01:06.455 --> 01:07.783
Who was Bart?

01:07.956 --> 01:10.874
And how did he manage
to write his name in solid cement?

01:11.850 --> 01:14.750
He must've been smarter than his sister
Lisa, about whom we know nothing.

01:14.922 --> 01:17.674
Say, let's bring him back to life
by using technology.

01:18.842 --> 01:20.171
Ay caramba!

01:27.309 --> 01:31.389
- What's normal to him amazes us.
- He will be our new god.

01:38.195 --> 01:41.315
Good, somebody's shadow.
I'll just turn and brag about my work.

01:42.658 --> 01:45.742
Bart, you've graffito-tagged
public property.

01:45.953 --> 01:47.661
It was an accident.

01:48.205 --> 01:50.826
I can't believe you vandalized
your own hometown, Bart.

01:50.100 --> 01:54.360
- What would Jebediah Springfield say?
- He'd be cool with it.

01:54.253 --> 01:57.207
Homer, will you please help me
make a big deal of this?

01:57.423 --> 02:01.420
What for? Nobody cared when Bogart
defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.

02:01.635 --> 02:04.340
Well, I'm just shocked
by this whole family.

02:04.513 --> 02:07.860
Whatever happened
to good old-fashioned town pride?

02:07.308 --> 02:09.715
It's been going down
since the lake caught fire.

02:09.935 --> 02:14.348
Now, just a darn minute.
This town is a part of who you are.

02:14.523 --> 02:17.607
This is a Springfield Isotopes cap.

02:17.776 --> 02:20.813
When you wear it,
you're wearing Springfield.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.648
When you eat a fish from our river,
you're eating Springfield.

02:24.825 --> 02:29.820
When you make lemonade from
our trees, you're drinking Springfield.

02:30.390 --> 02:33.750
Mom, when you give that lecture,
you're boring Springfield.

02:33.292 --> 02:36.162
You have roots in this town,
and you ought to show respect.

02:36.378 --> 02:37.837
This town is a part of us all.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.496
A part of us all. A part of us all.

02:40.716 --> 02:43.337
Sorry to repeat myself,
but it'll help you remember.

02:44.970 --> 02:46.927
This town is a part of us all.

02:47.139 --> 02:49.547
A part of us all. A part of us all.

02:49.725 --> 02:51.634
Wow, that does work.

02:55.105 --> 02:58.142
- Hey, gonna win some this season?
- Gonna try.

03:05.157 --> 03:09.321
When it comes to catching trout,
nothing beats the German light infantry.

03:09.495 --> 03:10.823
Beautiful, aren't they?

03:10.996 --> 03:14.330
Yep. I'm gonna huck them at cars.

03:19.421 --> 03:21.497
Hey, Milhouse.
How's the lemonade business?

03:21.674 --> 03:24.425
It's clearly booming, Bart.

03:25.844 --> 03:28.632
I don't even want any.
I just bought a pity glass.

03:28.806 --> 03:32.506
We've squozen our whole supply.
To the lemon tree!

03:43.153 --> 03:45.941
Thar she grows.

03:48.909 --> 03:52.658
You know, Milhouse, I've been thinking.
This town ain't so bad.

03:52.830 --> 03:56.281
Good friends, lots of lemons,
numerous angel sightings.

03:56.500 --> 04:00.367
When you get right down to it,
Springfield's a pretty cool place to live.

04:00.546 --> 04:02.538
Springfield sucks.

04:04.258 --> 04:06.500
Hey, stop talking bad
about my town, man.

04:06.677 --> 04:09.298
- Why don't you make me.
- I don't make trash, I burn it.

04:09.513 --> 04:12.847
- Then I guess you're a garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?

04:13.580 --> 04:15.632
- A garbage man.
- Oh, I know you are, but what am I?

04:15.853 --> 04:18.426
- A garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?

04:18.647 --> 04:20.853
- A garbage man.
- Takes one to know one.

04:22.108 --> 04:23.852
- Checkmate.
- Hey, kid.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.186
Stop wearing your backpack
over one shoulder.

04:26.363 --> 04:30.231
- We invented that. Copycat.
- You copied us.

04:30.451 --> 04:33.820
Step over this line and say that.
I'll kick your butt...

04:33.996 --> 04:35.324
...at Nintendo.

04:36.248 --> 04:38.656
I just put a rock in your crummy town.

04:38.876 --> 04:42.420
That's a crud rock.
It belongs in Crudtown.

04:45.924 --> 04:51.299
Look at the weak little baby.
You're stupid, you stupid, weak baby.

04:51.472 --> 04:54.841
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Hey, they're taking our lemons.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.891
We can't spare a single one.

05:01.398 --> 05:04.518
You just got citric acid in my eye.

05:04.693 --> 05:07.564
You'll pay for that, Springfield.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.982
Some things never change.

05:12.201 --> 05:14.407
Hey, everybody, an old man's talking.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.788
Grampa's the name.

05:18.999 --> 05:23.578
Did you know this tree dates
back to frontier times?

05:26.215 --> 05:27.543
Shut up!

05:27.758 --> 05:32.384
It all began when Jebediah Springfield
first came to these lands...

05:32.554 --> 05:36.932
...with his partner,
Shelbyville Manhattan.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.938
People, our search is over.

05:44.149 --> 05:47.649
On this site, we shall build a new town,
where we can worship freely...

05:47.820 --> 05:52.114
...govern justly and grow vast fields
of hemp for making rope and blankets.

05:52.282 --> 05:55.533
- Yes, and marry our cousins.
- I was...

05:55.703 --> 05:59.451
What are you talking about, Shelbyville?
Why would we marry our cousins?

05:59.623 --> 06:01.201
Because they're so attractive.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.783
I thought that was
the whole point of this journey.

06:03.961 --> 06:05.621
- Absolutely not.
- I tell you...

06:05.796 --> 06:09.461
...I won't live in a town that robs men
of the right to marry their cousins.

06:09.675 --> 06:12.470
Well, then we'll form our own town.

06:12.219 --> 06:16.860
Who will come and live a life devoted
to chastity, abstinence...

06:16.265 --> 06:19.100
...and a flavorless mush
I call rootmarm?

06:28.694 --> 06:32.526
The town of Springfield
was born on that day.

06:32.740 --> 06:37.982
And to mark that sweet moment,
our people planted this lemon tree...

06:38.203 --> 06:41.619
...lemons being the sweetest fruit
available at the time.

06:45.878 --> 06:49.211
Those Shelbyville kids think they're hot.
You know what? They're not.

06:49.381 --> 06:52.667
- I really agree with you on this one, Bart.
- Class, please.

06:52.885 --> 06:54.593
If you don't learn Roman numerals...

06:54.762 --> 06:57.134
...you'll never know
when movies were copyrighted.

06:57.348 --> 07:00.183
Come quick. Something's happened.
No time to explain.

07:00.392 --> 07:02.515
No, children. No.

07:02.728 --> 07:06.476
Your education is important.
Roman numerals, et cetera.

07:06.649 --> 07:09.210
Whatever. I tried.

07:12.154 --> 07:15.274
Are you sure it wouldn't be faster
to just tell us what happened?

07:15.449 --> 07:19.613
No. I said there's no time to explain,
and I stick by that.

07:21.664 --> 07:23.407
The lemon tree's gone.

07:24.830 --> 07:26.574
And the tracks appear to lead
into Shelbyville.

07:26.794 --> 07:29.332
Oh, look, a clue. A candy-bar wrapper.

07:29.505 --> 07:32.624
Oh, they're always eating candy
in Shelbyville.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.299
- They love the sweet taste.
- We gotta get that tree back.

07:36.512 --> 07:40.462
You mean going to Shelbyville?
We'll never make it out alive.

07:40.641 --> 07:45.102
That lemon tree's part of our town and,
as kids, the backbone of our economy.

07:45.312 --> 07:48.764
We'll get it back
or choke their rivers with our dead.

07:52.270 --> 07:53.356
Where are you going, Bart?

07:53.570 --> 07:56.904
Mom, you won't believe this, but
something you said got through to me.

07:58.283 --> 08:02.661
And now, I am going to teach
some kids a lesson.

08:02.871 --> 08:06.205
- I choose to take that literally.
- Death to Shelbyville!

08:06.375 --> 08:10.420
Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, son.

08:10.587 --> 08:11.916
Tute on.

08:15.884 --> 08:19.170
Hey, Milhouse,
get your invasion supplies, and let's go.

08:24.768 --> 08:26.310
Get him. Come on.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.109
- Where did he go?
- Over here, my friends.

08:32.275 --> 08:35.609
Or is it over here?

08:38.615 --> 08:40.158
Yeah.

08:41.869 --> 08:45.350
Here's how it goes. I'm the leader.
Milhouse is my loyal sidekick.

08:45.205 --> 08:47.412
Nelson's the tough guy.
Martin's the smart guy.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.908
Todd's the religious guy
who ends up going crazy.

08:50.127 --> 08:51.290
And now...

08:51.462 --> 08:55.506
...the time has come to cross this line
into mystery and danger.

08:55.716 --> 08:59.299
To step out of childhood
and become men.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.224
If you get lost, remember...

09:14.443 --> 09:18.571
...you can always find east
by staring directly at the sun.

09:18.781 --> 09:21.450
Here's a tip.
Put a pinch of sage in your boots...

09:21.617 --> 09:25.401
...and all day long,
a spicy scent is your reward.

09:26.664 --> 09:28.455
Oh, my gosh. Look.

09:28.624 --> 09:31.162
The fire hydrants here are yellow.

09:31.377 --> 09:33.749
This place is starting to freak me out.

09:33.962 --> 09:37.331
Danger coming. Behind us.

09:38.842 --> 09:42.211
What is it, boy? Is there something
behind that wall we should beat up?

09:42.388 --> 09:46.551
No time to check it out now.
We've got lemonade to sell.

09:48.394 --> 09:49.888
Radical.

09:50.771 --> 09:52.313
They're getting rich off us.

09:52.523 --> 09:54.681
And that kid with the backpack
said "radical."

09:54.858 --> 09:58.393
I say "radical."
That's my thing that I say.

09:58.612 --> 10:01.648
I feel like I'm gonna explode here.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.770
It's lunchtime. Do you know
where your brother's tutoring?

10:07.705 --> 10:11.702
Tutoring? The only thing Bart's teaching
is guerrilla combat in Shelbyville.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.408
- You have a number we can reach him?
- No, Mom.

10:14.586 --> 10:17.457
Bart and some kids ran off
to wage war on Shelbyville.

10:19.133 --> 10:20.793
Homer, come quick.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.969
Bart's quit his tutoring job
and joined a violence gang.

10:26.307 --> 10:28.548
The trail has become indistinct.

10:28.726 --> 10:31.845
I suggest we split up
to cover more ground.

10:32.210 --> 10:34.725
Good idea. Milhouse,
you and me will be Omega Team.

10:34.898 --> 10:37.389
Todd, you and Data
are Team Strike Force.

10:37.568 --> 10:42.111
- Nelson, that leaves you and Martin.
- Team Discovery Channel.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.110
Your wussiness better come in handy.

10:49.663 --> 10:51.572
- What's going on?
- I want some answers.

10:51.790 --> 10:54.875
Okay, folks, look,
I called the police captain in Shelbyville.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.586
He says he hasn't seen our kids.

10:56.754 --> 10:59.245
But if they show up in the morgue,
he's gonna fax us.

10:59.465 --> 11:03.961
- Oh, man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks.
- Honey, I was born in Shelbyville.

11:04.136 --> 11:06.100
And it tears me up inside.

11:06.221 --> 11:09.507
This is my fault.
I tried to teach Bart about town pride.

11:09.683 --> 11:12.803
But the power of my words
filled him with a sort of madness.

11:12.978 --> 11:18.103
Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's
problems on your one little speech.

11:18.275 --> 11:19.900
If anything turned him bad...

11:20.690 --> 11:23.438
...it's that time you let him wear
a bathing suit instead of underwear.

11:23.614 --> 11:28.359
- And let's not forget your little speech.
- Isn't there anything we can do?

11:28.535 --> 11:31.157
Yes, there is. Come on, everybody.

11:31.330 --> 11:35.300
Let's go into Shelbyville
and get those kids back ourselves.

11:35.209 --> 11:36.952
I got an RV we can use.

11:37.169 --> 11:38.912
- Flanders'.
- Yeah!

11:39.880 --> 11:42.421
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay, but just go a little bit easy on it.

11:42.591 --> 11:44.750
Pile in, everybody.
No time to wipe your feet.

11:44.927 --> 11:45.958
Come on.

11:49.348 --> 11:51.506
Okay, piglet, start squealing.

11:51.684 --> 11:54.900
Where'd you get the lemons
for this lemonade?

11:54.186 --> 11:56.143
This is Country Time Lemonade Mix.

11:56.313 --> 11:59.480
There's never been anything
close to a lemon in it. I swear.

11:59.650 --> 12:02.355
Hey. Nobody hassles
my little brother.

12:02.528 --> 12:06.478
Hey. And no one manhandles
the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz.

12:06.657 --> 12:09.907
Spring forth, burly protector,
and save me.

12:14.390 --> 12:15.368
Jeez.

12:15.541 --> 12:18.791
I never hang out with him, normally.

12:20.212 --> 12:23.795
Hark to the tale of Nelson
And the boy he loved so dear

12:24.508 --> 12:28.700
They remained the best of friends
For years and years and years

12:28.220 --> 12:30.972
- What are they saying?
- I'm not sure.

12:31.140 --> 12:34.141
- I thought you said you could read lips.
- I assumed I could.

12:34.351 --> 12:35.762
It's no use, Milhouse.

12:35.936 --> 12:38.937
If we're gonna find that lemon tree,
I've got to go undercover.

12:39.106 --> 12:42.605
- What I need is a new face.
- You leave that to the baron and me.

12:46.613 --> 12:48.986
Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians.

12:49.199 --> 12:50.528
Wait a minute.

12:50.701 --> 12:54.117
If you're from Shelbyville, how come
we've never seen you at school?

12:54.288 --> 12:57.823
- I don't go to school.
- Okay, what's two plus two?

12:58.420 --> 12:59.868
- Five.
- Story checks out.

13:00.850 --> 13:03.371
We just got word
there's Springfield kids in town.

13:05.490 --> 13:06.377
Curse those handsome devils.

13:06.550 --> 13:10.850
We're going up to the bluffs to paint
"Springfield sucks" in huge letters.

13:10.262 --> 13:14.940
That way, whenever they look into
Shelbyville, they'll realize that they suck.

13:14.266 --> 13:17.884
- Radical.
- Quit copying me.

13:18.103 --> 13:22.481
You know, I wish there was
a Springfield kid here right now.

13:22.650 --> 13:25.570
I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs.

13:25.277 --> 13:26.855
No, not in my mouth...

13:27.290 --> 13:30.196
...is what the kid would say.
To the bluffs.

13:33.118 --> 13:35.692
Well, a friendly Springfield hello
there, neighbors.

13:35.871 --> 13:39.370
You know, we think some kids of ours
may be missing in your town.

13:39.583 --> 13:40.911
Missing children?

13:41.850 --> 13:43.706
Sounds like Springfield's
got a discipline problem.

13:43.921 --> 13:47.337
Maybe that's why we beat them
at football nearly half the time, huh?

13:49.635 --> 13:53.383
Quit stalling, kid.
Write "Springfield sucks" in giant letters.

14:02.398 --> 14:04.889
His can control is excellent.

14:05.670 --> 14:09.361
Yes. And that wig makes him look
a lot like one of the Beatles.

14:11.407 --> 14:16.318
That's right, the stranger who walks
amongst you is me, Bart Simpson.

14:17.538 --> 14:19.365
You know, Bart Simpson.

14:20.791 --> 14:24.160
- From Springfield?
- He's from Springfield. Get him!

14:36.849 --> 14:39.600
I'll use these spray cans
as jetpacks and fly to safety.

14:39.810 --> 14:41.933
So long, losers.

14:46.525 --> 14:48.601
You're dead.

14:48.777 --> 14:50.853
Hey, look.
Someone's attractive cousin.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.734
- Where? Where?
- I don't see anybody.

14:59.163 --> 15:01.369
So he thinks he can
out-skateboard me, huh?

15:01.582 --> 15:04.417
Launch me, boys.

15:28.442 --> 15:32.226
Slow down, you sidewalk-surfing
cube-gleamers.

15:39.244 --> 15:40.904
"Wet cement."

15:46.585 --> 15:49.760
I could sure use
that flying motorcycle now.

15:49.254 --> 15:51.461
You had your chance.

16:02.601 --> 16:04.807
Safe at last.

16:10.984 --> 16:14.210
"Caution: Exit through door seven only.

16:14.196 --> 16:17.861
All other rooms contain
man-eating tigers."

16:20.119 --> 16:23.701
Roman numerals. They never even tried
to teach us that in school.

16:25.416 --> 16:27.989
Milhouse, what's seven
in Roman numerals?

16:28.210 --> 16:32.374
I'll tell you, but you really should end
each transmission with the word "over."

16:32.548 --> 16:34.457
- Over.
- Correction:

16:34.633 --> 16:37.669
The only thing that's over
is that transmission.

16:37.886 --> 16:40.460
Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?

16:41.348 --> 16:45.346
- But Milhouse is my name.
- But I thought I was the only one.

16:45.519 --> 16:47.761
A pain I know all too well.

16:47.980 --> 16:53.210
So this is what it feels like
when doves cry.

16:53.235 --> 16:55.607
Milhouse. Milhouse.
Now what do I do?

16:57.310 --> 16:58.608
Wait. I got it.

16:58.824 --> 17:00.318
I got it.

17:00.492 --> 17:02.818
I don't got it. Okay, think, Bart.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.657
Where have you seen
Roman numerals before?

17:05.830 --> 17:08.500
I know. Rocky V.
That was the fifth one.

17:08.709 --> 17:14.664
So Rocky V plus Rocky II
equals Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge!

17:16.633 --> 17:18.507
Come back here.

17:21.550 --> 17:24.387
It's no use.
I'm never gonna find that tree.

17:24.558 --> 17:29.765
This whole raid was as useless as that
yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there.

17:29.938 --> 17:31.267
Wait a minute.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.598
There's a lemon behind that rock.

17:35.270 --> 17:36.604
The tree!

17:47.581 --> 17:49.621
A car impound lot.

17:49.833 --> 17:52.704
The impenetrable fortress of suburbia.

17:52.878 --> 17:56.329
- We'll never get the tree back now.
- Keep your voices down, boys.

17:56.507 --> 18:00.635
- We didn't get this far to get found out.
- Found them! You kids are in big trouble.

18:00.803 --> 18:04.600
- Running away from home like this.
- But they stole our lemon tree.

18:04.223 --> 18:06.714
I don't care what excuse you've got.

18:06.892 --> 18:09.597
Nothing's gonna stop me
in the middle of this speech.

18:09.770 --> 18:11.513
You're gonna... Lemon tree?

18:12.982 --> 18:16.564
That tree's been in Springfield
since the time of our forefathers.

18:16.735 --> 18:20.187
Give it back,
or we'll bust in there and take it.

18:20.406 --> 18:22.149
Bust in here and take it?

18:22.324 --> 18:26.536
- You must stupider than you look.
- Stupider like a fox!

18:33.711 --> 18:35.860
I'm okay.

18:39.258 --> 18:42.175
Don't you get it, Springfield?
It's over. You lose.

18:42.344 --> 18:46.722
Now, if you'll excuse me,
all this talk has made me hungry.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.899
This is the darkest day
in the history of Springfield.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.605
If anybody wants me,
I'll be in the shower.

18:59.820 --> 19:03.230
There's got to be a way
to get that tree back.

19:03.198 --> 19:05.524
Hey, look. A hospital.

19:05.743 --> 19:07.201
Pull in there.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.279
Oh, great. Now I'm upside down.

19:15.252 --> 19:19.360
Oh, dear, some thoughtless human being
has parked in a hospital zone.

19:36.440 --> 19:41.232
No one in history
has ever done anything this clever.

19:44.490 --> 19:46.281
I'll get the gate.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.949
That's okay, son. I'll take care of him.

19:55.834 --> 19:59.380
Faster, son!
He's got a taste for meat now.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.130
Get out here, son.
There's a-doings a-transpiring.

20:10.224 --> 20:13.590
Let's shut the gate and seal them in.

20:13.268 --> 20:15.344
Gun it, Flanders.

20:15.604 --> 20:19.139
It won't start.
Something's draining the battery.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.401
Sorry.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.484
We made it.

20:29.785 --> 20:31.576
Eat my shorts, Shelbyville.

20:31.787 --> 20:33.863
- Eat my shorts.
- Eat my shorts.

20:34.390 --> 20:36.198
Yes, eat all of our shirts.

20:36.417 --> 20:38.705
Oh, you lousy Springfielders, you...

20:38.877 --> 20:41.166
Shake harder, boy.

20:42.881 --> 20:44.957
We did it!

20:46.930 --> 20:48.382
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:52.474 --> 20:57.635
And with that, a mighty cheer went up
from the heroes of Springfield.

20:57.855 --> 21:01.580
They had brought the sacred tree
back to its native soil.

21:01.233 --> 21:04.151
And though Flanders was stuck
with the impound fee...

21:04.319 --> 21:07.320
...he could easily afford it.

21:07.531 --> 21:11.481
- More lemonade, Bart?
- Absolutely.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.198
Say when.

21:14.580 --> 21:17.201
There are over 14 parts
of the lemon that are...

21:17.374 --> 21:21.668
And with that, a mighty cheer went up
from the heroes of Shelbyville.

21:21.879 --> 21:24.796
They had banished
the awful lemon tree forever...

21:24.965 --> 21:26.839
...because it was haunted.

21:27.510 --> 21:28.675
Now, let's all celebrate...

21:28.844 --> 21:32.593
...with a cool glass of turnip juice.
