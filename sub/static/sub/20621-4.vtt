00:05.006 --> 00:08.217
Crispen Caruthers
was a beloved son,

00:08.300 --> 00:10.886
brother and uncle.

00:10.970 --> 00:14.098
His love for his family
was only matched

00:14.181 --> 00:18.769
by his insatiable
love of model trains.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.272
He was a noble man.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.734
And I believe that
Crispen, the conductor,

00:24.817 --> 00:27.028
as he liked to call himself,

00:27.111 --> 00:30.114
is all aboard a big train...

00:30.197 --> 00:31.657
- Oh, fuck it, why not?
- ...with the tracks...

00:31.741 --> 00:34.035
...leading straight to Heaven.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.453
Hello.

01:01.187 --> 01:02.104
Nope.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.904
Okay, next up-- Dev, 33.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.322
Hmm.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.365
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm, okay.

01:13.449 --> 01:14.784
Think he likes pasta much?

01:16.494 --> 01:17.953
What a clown.

01:18.037 --> 01:19.497
- Can I see your phone for a second?
- Yeah.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.706
Just want to...

01:20.790 --> 01:22.374
What the fuck?

01:22.458 --> 01:25.252
- That was so rude.
- Oh, come on.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.380
I got a match!

01:28.464 --> 01:29.340
Boom.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.747
- Dev?
- Christine?

02:43.831 --> 02:45.207
- Christine.
- Hey, good to meet you.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.209
Hey, and good to meet you.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.752
Oh, wait. Oh, you got
something on your jacket.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.004
- Oh.
- Is this fur?

02:50.087 --> 02:52.214
Yeah, I work at a dog hotel.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.133
Wait. What? A dog hotel?

02:54.216 --> 02:56.635
Yep. It's, urn, called
Chateau Marmutt.

02:56.719 --> 02:57.761
We just opened.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.513
Can we not talk
about this, please?

02:59.597 --> 03:01.682
- Sure, sure. Oh, I know that place.
- Okay.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.518
It's over on 52nd
and Bark Avenue.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.854
Wow. Okay, that was
your one dog pun.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.856
- Okay, are you happy?
- Yes, I am.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.191
All right, let's go.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.863
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.907
It was really weird
seeing you on the app.

03:17.990 --> 03:21.035
Last I saw you, you'd just gotten fired
from that Garden Depot commercial, right?

03:21.118 --> 03:22.745
I know. You want
to sit over there?

03:22.828 --> 03:24.079
- Yeah.
- Yeah, go.

03:24.163 --> 03:25.789
It's always weird

03:25.873 --> 03:27.750
when you see friends
on these things,

03:27.833 --> 03:30.336
'cause it's like, all right, are we
swiping right 'cause we're friends,

03:30.419 --> 03:33.422
or is it a possible
boning situation?

03:33.505 --> 03:34.715
Right.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.426
Let's be clear, we're
both here as dates, yes?

03:37.509 --> 03:39.386
Yes.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.638
Let's avoid the phrase

03:40.721 --> 03:42.973
"possible boning
situation," though, right?

03:43.057 --> 03:44.683
Oh, for sure. Poor
choice of words.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.268
I meant to say, um...

03:46.352 --> 03:48.604
"potential for romance
and/or magic."

03:48.729 --> 03:50.522
Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.983
Hey, Andrea, can I get a glass

03:53.067 --> 03:54.360
of that light red you
poured me the other day?

03:54.443 --> 03:56.654
- You want to try this?
- Yeah, sure.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.198
So what's the deal with it?
Is it special?

03:59.281 --> 04:00.199
Um...

04:00.282 --> 04:04.245
hmm, well, apparently, the
winemaker loves '90s R&B,

04:04.328 --> 04:05.537
and he plays it
throughout the vineyards,

04:05.621 --> 04:09.583
and it really helps open up the
depth of flavor within the grapes.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.126
I don't know anything about wine.
It's from France.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.336
Oh.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.965
So how's work going?
Everything well?

04:16.048 --> 04:18.550
I'm kind of
"fun-employed" right now.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.886
Just going out a lot,
having a good time.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.639
Oh, so just... going to clubs
and getting drunk a lot?

04:23.722 --> 04:25.057
Mm-hmm.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.017
Plus, my parents are,
like, super rich,

04:27.101 --> 04:29.561
so it's like, why
get a job, right?

04:29.645 --> 04:32.606
Yeah, just keep using
their money, right?

04:32.690 --> 04:34.817
After I left LA, I
moved to New York,

04:34.900 --> 04:37.778
and for the last couple years,
I've been working as a lawyer,

04:37.861 --> 04:39.280
mostly in the tech industry.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.948
- Cool.
- What do you do?

04:41.031 --> 04:45.869
I host a competitive cupcake show
called Clash of the Cupcakes.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.746
Cool.

04:47.830 --> 04:48.914
Um...

04:50.374 --> 04:54.044
I'm out of stuff to say, so I
think I'll probably head out.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.297
Okay, well, that was a
really fun five minutes.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.215
I think I'll just, uh,
grab these drinks, then.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.591
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.221
So the original Chateau
Marmutt is in LA,

05:04.305 --> 05:05.973
but they just opened up
the branch in New York

05:06.056 --> 05:07.308
and that's where I work now.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.852
- Is it fun?
- No, it's horrible.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.396
There's dogs everywhere
going crazy.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.897
Whoa.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.482
All right, last question.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.401
Have any famous
dogs stayed there?

05:18.235 --> 05:20.446
Maybe that dog from The Artist
might have stayed there once.

05:20.529 --> 05:21.613
What?

05:21.697 --> 05:23.866
Hey, guys, a table just opened
up if you want to grab it.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.909
- Sure.
- Cool.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.828
Hey, so what was that pup like?

05:27.911 --> 05:29.788
Ugh, huge asshole.
Pissed everywhere.

05:29.872 --> 05:30.873
- Never tipped the staff.
- Mm.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.876
I heard that dog from Frasier
is a real prick, too.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.924
So, yeah, after I got out of art school,
I started working in galleries.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.052
- Oh, where'd you go to school?
- NYU.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.511
- Oh, me too.
- Oh, cool.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.764
All right, bathroom break.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.144
Is she going to the bathroom
or going to do coke?

05:54.188 --> 05:55.689
Sorry I had to cancel on Sunday.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.400
I had to tune in for
that WWE SummerSlam.

05:58.484 --> 06:00.319
Pay-Per-View. You watch?

06:00.402 --> 06:02.112
Uh, no, I missed it. How was it?

06:02.196 --> 06:03.030
Amazing.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.742
Dean Ambrose wrestled Samoa
Joe for the WWE Championship.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.453
And Samoa Joe is about to hit
him with the muscle buster,

06:09.536 --> 06:12.122
but then Ambrose put him into
a crossface chickenwing.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.375
Then Samoa Joe reversed into
his submission finisher,

06:14.458 --> 06:15.751
the Coquina Clutch.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.048
Okay, I-I'm not sure I follow,
but that sounds entertaining.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.716
You think if I was a wrestler...

06:22.800 --> 06:24.885
my name could be Samosa Joe?

06:24.968 --> 06:26.428
Samosa Joe?

06:26.512 --> 06:29.348
Like the savory Indian snack?
Just a play on Samoa Joe?

06:29.431 --> 06:32.893
No, it's Samoa Joe...

06:32.976 --> 06:35.062
like, from the Isle of Samoa.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.482
Can I ask you a question that you
might find a little offensive?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.484
Mm, I'm intrigued.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.194
Do you just date Indian girls?

06:42.277 --> 06:45.406
No, I date people of different
ethnicities, skin tones.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.074
What about you? Is it
Indian dudes only?

06:47.157 --> 06:49.410
- No, no, I'll date anyone.
- Well, now I feel special.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.955
But I did, uh, date
this white guy once,

06:53.038 --> 06:56.417
and then I found out later that he
dated four Indian girls before me.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.585
What? Four? That's
fetish territory.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.045
That's what I said.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.422
But, like, where's
the line, right?

07:01.505 --> 07:03.882
Like, what if a girl
dated two Indian dudes?

07:03.966 --> 07:05.926
Hmm...

07:06.009 --> 07:07.970
Two's okay, but it
can't be back to back,

07:08.053 --> 07:10.806
'cause then it's like,
"Mm, fetish is brewing."

07:10.889 --> 07:13.225
It's like this lady just realized
she's really into Indian dudes.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.310
Right. But what
about 20 in a row?

07:15.394 --> 07:18.188
Mm... that lady is definitely
an Indian-dude serial killer.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.648
Like, she for sure...

07:19.731 --> 07:21.525
has an Indian guy
in her freezer.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.735
There's, like, a head.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.487
Like, maybe a hairy arm.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.030
Right by a box of
Toaster Strudels.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.409
Oh, my God, this
place is so cool.

07:30.492 --> 07:31.535
Okay, so you host
a cupcake show.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.745
That's amazing. I
really like cupcakes.

07:33.829 --> 07:35.873
My favorite kind of
cupcakes-- vanilla frosted,

07:35.956 --> 07:38.459
but I also like
strawberry frosting, too.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.086
Okay, so I know your job.
Siblings, tell me.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.671
How many do you have?

07:43.547 --> 07:45.007
One little brother. You?

07:45.090 --> 07:46.258
Only child.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.301
Younger sister.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.552
Five brothers.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.220
Nine? That's a lot.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.097
I said five.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.349
Still kind of a lot, though.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.061
Sorry. Work stuff.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.773
Um...

08:01.857 --> 08:04.234
SO...

08:04.318 --> 08:05.527
I get the impression
that you're not really,

08:05.611 --> 08:07.362
like, a clique-ish
kind of Indian.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.489
What does that mean?

08:08.572 --> 08:11.408
You know, like an Indian person who
just hangs out with Indian people.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.327
No. I mean, I got my
Indian buds, though.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.371
You know, Ravi, Tanvi, got
our jacked guy, Anush.

08:16.455 --> 08:19.374
I used to be in one of those
Indian cliques in college.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.292
You know what's weird?

08:20.375 --> 08:22.669
Is there's always one white
person in those groups.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.796
Yes. I was in one also.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.757
And there was this
white girl, Marissa,

08:26.840 --> 08:30.135
and we were out one time, and I said,
"Hey, Marissa, do you want a drink?"

08:30.219 --> 08:31.261
And this is what she did.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.181
No! She can't do that.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.307
She did the head bob.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.351
- That's Indian use only.
- That's what I'm saying.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.186
- I could not believe that.
- Yeah, that's...

08:39.269 --> 08:41.188
- Ridiculous.
- I've never seen a white person do that.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.106
- I've n--
- It's-- It should be off limits, right?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.691
It definitely should be.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.569
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. I
really need to get this.

08:47.653 --> 08:48.987
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.120
So I got to give you props.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.206
I really enjoyed your
opening message to me.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.874
- Oh, thanks.
- Be honest, though.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.794
- Is that a line you send to everyone?
- What?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.796
No. I would never
do such a thing.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.673
I don't believe you.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.133
All right, you show me your
messages, I'll show you mine.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.761
Mm... I don't know.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.555
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Okay.

09:14.638 --> 09:17.057
- Don't back out of this, though.
- I won't. I won't. I'm here.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.436
All right, I send it to everyone,

09:21.520 --> 09:24.731
but everything else is custom
charming stuff just for you.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.525
All right, all right,
fair enough, fair enough.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.485
- Let's see yours.
- All right. Okay, here it is.

09:32.281 --> 09:33.699
Whoa!

09:33.782 --> 09:36.243
- There's so many guys.
- I know. I know.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.578
It just keeps going!

09:37.661 --> 09:40.205
I know. I've pretty much stopped
responding to most of it.

09:40.289 --> 09:43.000
See, that's why the Whole
Foods line is key.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.042
It breaks through the clutter.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.670
- No, it's true.
- Is that what most guys say?

09:46.753 --> 09:49.840
"Hey," "Hey," "Hey," "Hi," "Hi,"
"Hey," "Hey," "Hi," "Hey," "Hi"?

09:49.923 --> 09:52.509
Yes, yes, but, I mean,
I also get that, like,

09:52.593 --> 09:54.761
really gross, like,
disgusting stuff, too, a lot.

09:54.845 --> 09:55.762
Like what?

09:55.846 --> 09:58.181
Well, like, there was
the guy who was like,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.851
"Hey, just come on over, and
we'll fuck on my hammock."

10:00.934 --> 10:03.979
A guy sent me his penis and
was like, "This is my penis."

10:04.062 --> 10:05.022
Fetish-y Indian stuff.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.231
Fetish-y Latina stuff.

10:06.315 --> 10:08.108
Fetish-y short
Filipino girl stuff.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.861
One guy texted me a picture
of a handwritten letter.

10:10.944 --> 10:11.945
That seems nice.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.365
It just said, "What up with
them big old titties?"

10:15.449 --> 10:16.575
In permanent marker.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.285
Mm, that's not as nice.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.039
And then he drew two
big old titties.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.999
Oh, being a black
woman on these apps--

10:24.082 --> 10:25.459
completely different situation.

10:25.542 --> 10:28.045
I mean, compared to my white
friends, I get way less activity.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.423
I also find that I rarely match
with guys outside of my race.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.424
Same for me.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.176
A lot of my matches
are Indian women.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.637
I did read somewhere that the
people that do worst on the apps

10:36.720 --> 10:38.847
are Asian men and black women.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.933
Well, it's great white people finally
have an advantage somewhere.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.101
- Cheers to them.
- To white people.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.400
I am so sorry. Was that long?

10:50.484 --> 10:52.778
Yeah, it was about 15 minutes.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.155
Yeah, that's really bad.
I'm really sorry.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.741
Um, let me buy us a nice
bottle to make up for it?

10:57.824 --> 10:59.451
All right.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.495
What'd you do over the weekend?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.080
Uh, nothing much.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.956
Some friends and I went
to the Guggenheim.

11:05.040 --> 11:05.957
What about you?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.834
I got hammered all weekend.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.586
There's this French guy.
His name's Hubert.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.339
He's, like, this super-rich guy
who does nice stuff for me

11:12.422 --> 11:13.465
'cause he thinks I'm
gonna fuck him,

11:13.548 --> 11:15.133
and, like, I'm never
gonna fuck him.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.760
I mean, I, like,
fucked him once,

11:16.843 --> 11:18.720
but I'm never gonna
fuck him again.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.639
Anyway, he flew us
out to the Hamptons.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.183
It was completely insane.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.102
You would not believe it.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.979
Sounds completely insane.

11:28.063 --> 11:32.484
And then when I got home, I watched
that movie Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.902
And then I watched it again.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.320
It's a horrible movie.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.531
They kill Johnny Cage
in the first scene.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.699
Like, really?

11:38.782 --> 11:41.576
Uh, yeah, I agree. That's
an odd story move.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.121
All right, now try this. I
think you'll really love it.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.497
All right.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.754
Mmm! That is good.

11:52.838 --> 11:53.672
Good. Okay, good.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.675
I have friends who are super into
wine that turned me on to it.

11:56.758 --> 11:57.801
But I'm glad you like it.

11:57.884 --> 12:01.513
Yeah. Now it feels like you were
gone for five minutes instead of 15.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.889
My anger is subsiding.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.266
Okay, good.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.726
Phew. Cheers.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.103
Cheers.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.691
Ahh.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.277
Excuse me. Can you
please refill my water?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.404
Okay.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.239
Thank you.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.615
What a bitch.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.868
Is horrible service
the thing here?

12:23.660 --> 12:24.911
I don't think so.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.955
You want to get one more?

12:27.664 --> 12:30.584
No, I-I'm pretty tired. I
think I'm gonna head home.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.670
Yeah. Me too.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.340
Mm, this weed pen
is really awesome.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.176
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.345
- See how it lights up?
- I know. It's so pretty.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.306
It's like we're in the future.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.895
Um, hold up.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.314
Did you just see that
older Asian businessman

12:52.397 --> 12:53.732
licking a giant lollipop?

12:53.815 --> 12:57.444
- Yes! What is his story?
- I don't know.

12:57.527 --> 13:01.198
Maybe he's really into lollipops, and
he's tired of housing six at a time?

13:01.281 --> 13:04.201
Maybe he was a giant, and someone
hit him with a shrinking ray

13:04.284 --> 13:05.869
but they missed the lollipop.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.663
- Ooh, that's why it's still giant.
- Exactly.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.877
Oh, shit, those two
white guys are fighting!

13:15.670 --> 13:16.713
Oh, God.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.924
All right, I ain't stepping
in, but I'm gonna call 911.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.009
I'm sorry. Can you be quiet?
I'm trying to Snap this.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.011
- What the fuck?
- Sona!

13:27.098 --> 13:29.559
- Hey. Oh, my God.
- Patrick!

13:29.643 --> 13:32.312
It is so good to see you.
What's going on?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.564
Uh, not much. I just
moved back to the city.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.107
- Oh.
- Are you still at The Times?

13:36.191 --> 13:37.692
Yeah, yeah. Just grinding away.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.278
I just got back into town.
I was in Syria.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.031
- Hey, I'm Dev.
- Oh, hey. Patrick.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.075
Patrick's a war photographer.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.245
Uh, this is Dev. He hosts
Clash of the Cupcakes.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.246
Oh.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.456
Kind of a different war
we're fighting on our set.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.334
So, uh, Syria?

13:54.417 --> 13:55.919
That must have been
really intense.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.505
Yeah, last week we were
in this tiny village.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.132
We thought we were in a safe
zone, but out of nowhere,

14:01.216 --> 14:03.593
this car explodes, and I had
to get dragged out of there

14:03.677 --> 14:05.345
by my security detail.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.681
It was harrowing.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.308
Oh, God, I can't even imagine.

14:12.727 --> 14:16.273
Last week, uh, Mario Lopez was
on Clash of the Cupcakes.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.607
That was pretty harrowing, too.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.737
To be clear, I was
joking, but...

14:22.821 --> 14:25.198
I mean, Mario Lopez was
on the show, but...

14:25.282 --> 14:27.117
he's a pretty nice guy.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.580
Right. Well, Sona...

14:31.663 --> 14:36.126
It's so great to see you. I-I'd
love to catch up sometime or...

14:36.209 --> 14:38.712
Yeah, I'd love that.

14:41.756 --> 14:42.757
Bye.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.760
See you.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.096
I go everywhere on my bike.
It's the best.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.098
Aren't you scared you'll
get hit by a car and die?

14:50.181 --> 14:51.850
Mm, nah, I've been
hit, like, five times.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.351
This arm is completely metal.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.478
Whoa. So you're like
the Winter Soldier?

14:55.604 --> 14:57.606
- Who's that?
- Captain America's best friend!

14:57.689 --> 14:59.441
The Winter Soldier?
He's a super assassin?

14:59.524 --> 15:02.485
Also has a metal arm?
Real name Bucky Barnes?

15:02.569 --> 15:06.323
Fun fact-- my ex-girlfriend
nicknamed my belly Bucky.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.034
Oh, so to be clear,
on our first date,

15:09.117 --> 15:11.745
we're gonna talk about your
ex-girlfriend and comic books?

15:11.828 --> 15:13.204
And my belly.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.583
So, urn, how's the
acting stuff going?

15:16.666 --> 15:17.751
Keeping busy.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.294
Um, I actually just wrapped.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.005
I was filming a
airline safety video.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.298
Oh, who'd you play?

15:23.381 --> 15:25.300
I was the bad example of a woman

15:25.383 --> 15:27.844
who puts on the child's
mask before her own.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.429
Juicy role.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.555
Excuse me, guys.

15:30.639 --> 15:31.556
I don't mean to interrupt,

15:31.640 --> 15:34.309
but are you Dev from
Clash of the Cupcakes?

15:34.392 --> 15:37.771
Um... yeah. That's me.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.273
Oh, man, uh... I don't
want to freak you out,

15:40.357 --> 15:42.484
but your show helped me
through a tough time.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.319
My friend was
going through chemo,

15:44.402 --> 15:46.571
and we would watch Clash
of the Cupcakes together,

15:46.655 --> 15:51.368
and your upbeat attitude,
it got us through, man.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.786
She's totally healthy now,

15:52.869 --> 15:55.497
and I think you had a big
part to do with that.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.083
Wow. Uh, I'm really flattered.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.252
You know, I was just doing
the gig, hosting the show.

16:01.336 --> 16:02.879
Not to me, man.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.214
Not to me.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.969
What's the craziest thing
you've ever done'?

16:09.052 --> 16:10.929
Ever? I don't know.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.055
I'll tell you mine.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.974
This one time I went on a date,

16:14.057 --> 16:16.267
and, somehow, I wind
up in the bathroom

16:16.351 --> 16:18.687
giving the bartender a hand job.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.563
- Whoa.
- I mean, he was hot.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.815
I totally wanted to fuck,

16:21.898 --> 16:24.818
but I figured I'd
go back to my date

16:24.901 --> 16:26.987
'cause he got me a nice dinner.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.154
You know...

16:28.238 --> 16:30.782
So I come back,

16:30.865 --> 16:34.244
and my date was like,
"Uh, what's up?"

16:34.327 --> 16:36.621
And I was like, "Not much."

16:37.914 --> 16:40.083
Want to get another round?
I'll go get it.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.293
- I-I'm good.
- Are you sure?

16:43.920 --> 16:44.963
Yeah.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.298
So I'm sitting in front of
the PS4, look at the clock,

16:47.382 --> 16:50.301
realize I'm eight hours deep
into an Overwatch sesh.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.930
I'm starving by then, so I go
over to my ramen place, Mr. Taka.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.391
I know Mr. Taka.
That place is good.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.059
Oh, it's delicious.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.477
I love their chicken ramen.

16:59.561 --> 17:02.272
It has these really
nice yuzu lemon notes.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.815
Big fan of yuzu.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.026
I wrote this whole article
about it for my blog.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.153
Wait. I read that article.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.654
Are you the Ramaniac?

17:09.738 --> 17:12.532
Yeah. Keep it on the DL, man.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.325
I got to protect
my secret identity

17:14.409 --> 17:16.494
to have integrity for my blog.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.412
Yeah, yeah.

17:17.495 --> 17:21.082
I can't go to ramen restaurants,
have people start recognizing me.

17:21.166 --> 17:24.502
The chef's gonna come out
asking for my photo.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.172
I don't know. It's
a whole thing.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.090
I get it, sure. I am a fan.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.425
I-I read all the reviews.

17:30.508 --> 17:31.634
I have it on my
bookmarks toolbar.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.137
Oh, that's nice. It's
great to meet a fan.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.057
Uh, you know, we should go
get ramen together sometime.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.558
Yeah, that'd be fun.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.935
I'll come clean, I always
assumed the Ramaniac was a man.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.395
Oh, I get that.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.440
I've been told my writing style
has a masculine energy to it,

17:45.523 --> 17:48.568
you know, like
Hemingway or Bukowski.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.655
By the way, you may have heard
of my dad, John Larkin.

Yeah, I am.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.546
Here, I ordered these shots
for the three of us.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.298
- Wow.

18:10.381 --> 18:11.341

Wait.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.986

18:33.196 --> 18:35.406
Oh. Yeah.

18:35.490 --> 18:36.866
Well, that's not an emergency.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.868
That's just kind of shitty, right?
We're on a date.

18:40.537 --> 18:41.621
Kind of.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.289
Sorry.

It's just--it's
only ten o'clock,

18:45.250 --> 18:47.252
and I might be able to
meet someone later.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.840
Plus, I really like swiping.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.635
What do you think of that guy?

18:59.722 --> 19:01.349
Let's see the rest
of his profile.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.602
Um, sir, do you mind if
I put some music on?

19:04.686 --> 19:06.521
- Yeah, sure.
- What are you throwing on?

19:06.604 --> 19:09.732
Um, I think you might
be familiar with it.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.125
What? Then why are
you on the app?

19:27.208 --> 19:28.877
I like to use it
to make friends.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.629
No, that's not what it's for.
It's a dating app.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.339
It's called Love At First Sight.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.134
Well, maybe they should
make one for friends, then.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.512
I'm having a hard time
sympathizing with this problem.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.600
Well, do you want to
hang out next week...

19:43.683 --> 19:45.101
as friends?

19:45.185 --> 19:47.687

Oh.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.043

from the whole "Scatman" thing.

20:18.301 --> 20:19.677
- And so I thought...
- Yeah.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.971
- ...it was gonna go that way.
- Yeah, uh...

20:22.055 --> 20:22.972
But I guess not.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.016
I'm sorry. It's not--

20:25.099 --> 20:27.060
I-I had a lot of fun.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.979
I-I just think it's best if we're
just friends, though, you know?

20:30.063 --> 20:31.564
Sure, yeah.

20:32.523 --> 20:34.943
You know what? I think I might
go ahead and turn off "Scatman."

20:35.026 --> 20:36.194
Okay.

20:39.989 --> 20:43.034
So, urn, how much
further is your place?

20:43.117 --> 20:46.120
It's about 30 blocks
away from here.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.372
Ah.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.708
Thirty blocks.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.595
Um, this is me.

21:02.679 --> 21:03.805
All right.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.224
Do you want to come over to my
place and maybe have a drink?

21:06.307 --> 21:10.561
Uh, yes, but I can't
'cause I just met you.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.022
- So...
- Fair enough. I mean, I wasn't implying...

21:13.106 --> 21:14.315
No, no, of course not.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.692
I was thinking
we'd have a drink,

21:15.775 --> 21:17.235
maybe play Seinfeld Monopoly.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.945
Never played, but sounds fun.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.321
It is fun.

21:20.405 --> 21:23.074
Sometime. Maybe... maybe we
could do something next week.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.034
- Yeah, I'm around. I'll give you a ring.
- Okay.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.911
- All right, bye.
- All right, cool, bye.

21:34.168 --> 21:37.547
Mm, do you-- do you want to
grab a condom from that jar?

21:37.630 --> 21:38.923
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.525
Hey, sorry I
can't have you sleep over.

21:57.608 --> 22:01.237
I have to be at Chateau
Marmutt so early tomorrow.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.697
Oh, I understand.
It's no problem.

22:02.780 --> 22:06.367
Um... hey, random question.

22:06.451 --> 22:09.037
Um, what's up with the jar?

22:09.120 --> 22:12.332
Mm, it's, um, just a gift
that a friend gave me.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.294
Isn't it a little racist?

22:17.045 --> 22:18.046
Racist?

22:18.129 --> 22:21.466
You can't use that shade of black
to depict African-American people.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.302
No one else has ever
been offended by it.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.346
Have any black people seen it?

22:26.429 --> 22:29.182
Uh, I haven't had any
African-American guests.

22:29.265 --> 22:32.560
So I'm the person with the darkest
skin tone that's seen it,

22:32.643 --> 22:34.395
and I'm the most offended.

22:34.479 --> 22:35.897
Don't you see a
correlation there?

22:36.689 --> 22:37.982
So...

22:38.066 --> 22:41.527
you think I'm racist now, but
you still had sex with me?

22:42.445 --> 22:44.989
Y-yeah. I did.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.075
I mean, I was kind of...

22:47.867 --> 22:49.369
caught up in the moment.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.829
Don't you think
that's hypocritical?

22:51.913 --> 22:55.041
It definitely doesn't reflect
well on my principles, no.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.502
I think you should go.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.379
Well...

22:59.462 --> 23:02.423
just-- just show it to a
black person sometime.

23:02.507 --> 23:04.801
That's all I'm asking.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.010
This was all coming
from a good place.

23:06.094 --> 23:09.222
- I-I don't know what else to...
- Get-- get out of my apartment.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.515
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
