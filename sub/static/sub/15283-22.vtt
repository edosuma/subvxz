02:14.960 --> 02:17.550
I thought about you all day.

02:18.990 --> 02:21.180
Don't stop.

02:24.220 --> 02:26.380
We shouldn't. Vincent is downstairs.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.350
We'll just be real quiet about it.

02:31.780 --> 02:34.700
Oh,this is wrong.

03:12.900 --> 03:16.740
Excuse me. You,uh--you--
you dropped something.

03:52.470 --> 03:56.160
Hey,almost done. Think
I got a bite. A couple.

03:56.180 --> 03:59.140
One more potential,and then I'm home.

03:59.560 --> 04:03.540
What? Honey,I'm at work.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.450
I love you,too. Gotta go.

04:08.820 --> 04:12.300
Robert,right?Ok,I gotta tell you,robert,

04:12.320 --> 04:17.990
of all the houses I have on the
market,this one is my favorite.

04:18.010 --> 04:21.010
My name's not robert. Not robert.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.460
I'm sorry.

04:44.370 --> 04:47.840
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

05:07.750 --> 05:11.220
Her name's michelle watson,a realtor
murdered in buffalo a week ago.

05:11.260 --> 05:13.850
Until yesterday they had nothing,no
leads,and then they got this.

05:13.890 --> 05:16.600
Buffalo P.D.received it from
an unknown source yesterday.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.460
They able to trace it?

05:17.500 --> 05:20.050
No. Sent through an
encrypt server from ukraine.

05:20.070 --> 05:20.950
There's no sound.

05:20.990 --> 05:25.350
Yeah,at first glance there doesn't seem to
be a single frame to identify who shot it.

05:25.370 --> 05:26.790
He even covered up the mirror.

05:26.830 --> 05:30.150
I've seen some crazy things
sitting at this table,but that...

05:30.170 --> 05:31.450
Why send that to the police?

05:31.490 --> 05:34.820
Well,maybe it's a taunt,to
show the police how smart he is.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.820
Catch me if you can.

05:36.850 --> 05:38.580
The two people
in the video--

05:38.610 --> 05:41.960
They look directly at the unsub and neither
one seems to register that they're being filmed.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.530
I think it's probably a hidden camera.

05:43.570 --> 05:46.320
The witnesses were able to
give us enough for a sketch.

05:46.350 --> 05:49.490
White male,early 30s,wearing glasses.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.820
It looks like an editing suite.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.990
So he not only films
the murder,he edits it.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.170
Do we know what this is
that's playing on the monitor?

05:56.210 --> 05:59.310
Buffalo P.D.is concerned that it
might be another filmed killing.

05:59.330 --> 06:01.860
If it is,then we're not looking
at just one murder,but two.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.550
Buffalo is underfunded,undermanned,and
they need our help.

06:04.580 --> 06:05.920
Buffalo's a big gang town.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.710
Murder in the last year
alone was over 700 people.

06:08.730 --> 06:11.760
Garcia,I need you to go througthis frame
by frame and put everything on disks.

06:11.790 --> 06:13.150
Yes,sir. I'm on it.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.500
Also,put together a go bag.

06:15.550 --> 06:18.780
If we get any more of these films,I
want you on the ground taking point.

06:18.820 --> 06:22.590
- Is that ok with you?
- Yes,sir. Excellent. Ok.

06:23.290 --> 06:25.570
- Fast forward...
- Go bag. I don't have a go bag.

06:25.590 --> 06:27.700
There's something I
want everyone to see.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.410
He's writing something.

06:36.360 --> 06:42.440

"in order for the light to shine so
brightly,the darkness must be present."

07:18.220 --> 07:19.490
Francis bacon.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.980
A serial killer asking for
help. Wellthat's a new one on me.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.730
Attempt at sarcasm?

07:23.760 --> 07:24.910
What if he's sincere?

07:24.950 --> 07:26.540
Then he's deeply ambivalent.

07:26.570 --> 07:29.500
He wants to stop,but like
an alcoholic,he simply can't.

07:29.540 --> 07:32.040
When we see him driving,his
point of view is elevated.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.320
I'd say he's driving a van or an suv.

07:34.350 --> 07:37.010
And the film stops where
it starts--at his home.

07:37.050 --> 07:41.060
So we could use the film to trace back,street
by street,from the crime scene,right?

07:41.090 --> 07:42.570
It only lasts 9 minutes.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.720
And in this frame,he clearly
looks at a clock,and it's 9:22.

07:47.740 --> 07:51.920
Ok,the autopsy says michelle watson's
time of death was 4:30 in the afternoon.

07:51.950 --> 07:54.240
So,he edited out 7 hours.

07:54.280 --> 07:58.830
Garcia,look for unsolved murders of
men in their early 30s who were stabbed,

07:58.870 --> 08:01.140
Buffalo and surrounding
cities. Go back 10 years.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.810
Wouldn't vicap have
already picked up on that?

08:02.850 --> 08:05.500
Mm,vicap only went
web-based about a month ago,

08:05.520 --> 08:08.500
and buffalo P.D.only
recently uploaded the data.

08:08.810 --> 08:11.370
They show watson holding a day planner.
They find that at the crime scene.

08:11.390 --> 08:15.530
Yeah,that,her wallet,and all of her
jewelry,including a 3-carat diamond ring.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.080
So we know he's not
financially motivated.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.990
First count--i
have 22.

08:21.010 --> 08:24.200
22? We had 6. You think
it could be that many?

08:24.220 --> 08:27.190
We went back 10 years and
included surrounding cities.

08:27.210 --> 08:29.150
The unsub may be out
of his comfort zone.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.740
Now,they may not all be connected,but
they all match michelle's type.

08:31.770 --> 08:34.020
Blond,white,eay 30s.

08:34.059 --> 08:37.030
The autopsy reports will help us determine
which of these cases is connected.

08:37.070 --> 08:38.150
I'll get them here right away.

08:38.190 --> 08:40.370
We also need to take a look at the
crime scenes,detective henderson.

08:40.390 --> 08:41.200
Of course.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.480
I'll stay and help reid.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.240
I'll take prentiss and morgan.

08:48.770 --> 08:52.700
Tell me,do you think this is a
one off or can I expect more films?

08:52.750 --> 08:56.710
It's not a one off. The filming of his
kills makes him a sexual psychopath.

08:56.730 --> 09:00.710
We'll find more. Many
more. Just like this one.

09:33.380 --> 09:37.300
Help me is in direct cflict with
the psychology of a psychopath,

09:37.340 --> 09:38.940
and it's something
I've never seen before.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.110
Psychopaths don't have the capacity
to feel empathy towards others.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.790
They can mimic it,but
they can't feel it.

09:43.830 --> 09:44.890
Then he didn't mean it?

09:44.930 --> 09:48.170
Or someone or something is
showing him who he really is.

09:48.190 --> 09:51.710
Ok,friends,the video
on this film is analog.

09:51.740 --> 09:54.460
It's since been digitized,but
it is seriously degraded.

09:54.490 --> 09:55.190
Meaning what?

09:55.230 --> 10:00.120
Meaning this kind of degradation only happens over
at least a decade and thousands of repeated viewings.

10:00.150 --> 10:01.760
'S the only way he can get any release.

10:01.790 --> 10:04.150
Then you're right. He's
been doing this for 10 years.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.890
Uh,more like 20. That
woman in this video--

10:06.910 --> 10:09.180
She's wearing a sweater I
haven't seen since flashdance.

10:09.200 --> 10:15.220
On the day of her death,the 21st,michelle
entered the name robert at 4 p.m.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.630
Ah,we found no one connected to her with
that name and we think it's an alias.

10:18.670 --> 10:24.790
Michelle's highly organized,she's
precise,light of hand,so left-handed.

10:24.830 --> 10:25.690
How can you tell?

10:25.710 --> 10:29.290
The hardest point is where she starts,the
lightest point is where she tails off.

10:29.330 --> 10:33.640
In her case,she tails off
to the right. It's weird.

10:33.660 --> 10:34.990
- What?
- I'm not sure,

10:35.010 --> 10:40.710
but the number 29 is circled twice in
red ink and it tails off to the left.

10:40.750 --> 10:43.230
Whoever wrote that is right-handed.

10:44.930 --> 10:47.830
That person is right-handed
and "help me" is written in red.

10:47.860 --> 10:50.150
The unsub wrote the circled 29.

10:50.190 --> 10:53.190
Guys... Tomorrow's the 29th.

10:56.190 --> 10:58.960
Hotch is in position,so
let's walk through this.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.800
Ok,prentiss,michelle stood right here...

11:02.830 --> 11:05.610
- Facing me.
- Ok. Door's still open.

11:05.630 --> 11:08.200
She didn't shut it. And now
she turns her back to it.

11:08.220 --> 11:10.410
That's her first mistake.

11:10.430 --> 11:14.740
Ok,she's on the phone
with her husband. 3:55 p.m.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.530
She tells him she has
another client coming.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.970
Here comes the unsub. But you don't
turn around. Just keep talking.

11:20.850 --> 11:22.640
- Now the unsub's in the house.
- Yeah,I hear him.

11:22.660 --> 11:24.810
You hear him,but you
don't turn around. Not yet.

11:25.940 --> 11:27.450
Now you turn.

11:27.490 --> 11:29.820
Because if she leaves the front
door open and she turns her back,

11:29.840 --> 11:31.670
she must have been expecting robert.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.950
It's an open house. There's no one
else here. He knew she'd be alone.

11:34.970 --> 11:39.680
She's standing face to face with the
unsub,talking to him,and yet she still turns away.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.200
Second mistake.

11:41.220 --> 11:42.380
He poses no threat.

11:42.420 --> 11:45.260
Yeah,and if she'd seen a
camera,she would have registered it.

11:45.290 --> 11:47.760
Now she turns,faces the unsub...

11:47.800 --> 11:50.830
He strikes... Right into her chest.

11:50.850 --> 11:53.940
And then he drags her
over here to the sofa...

11:56.450 --> 11:57.640
And he films her death.

11:57.670 --> 12:01.060
He chose a controlled environment
in which he could ensure privacy.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.960
No witnesses,and most importantly,he
didn't have to dump the body.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.750
Garcia?

12:07.770 --> 12:09.720
Prentiss,the
point of view--

12:09.760 --> 12:13.370
She didn't see the camera because
the glasses have to be the camera.

12:13.660 --> 12:14.980
Thanks,garcia.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.780
He left us another message.

12:16.830 --> 12:19.390
He circled the number 29
in michelle's day planner.

12:19.420 --> 12:21.880
So we've only got 24 hours to stop him.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.010
Thanks.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.320
Morgan thinks the unsub's
glass are the camera.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.410
You need to get a sketch of the unsub
out to every camera shop in buffalo.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.880
If he hunts within a comfort zone,then whichever
of these camera shops he visits the most,

12:52.910 --> 12:55.050
That's the one he'll live closest to.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.720
All right. You heard the man.

12:56.740 --> 13:00.170
Ok,hotch also wants us to focus on
victims found in controlled locations.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.670
Secure areas with little
chance of witnesses.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.370
And ones where he left the
bodies where he killed them.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.560
Ok,based on that,june '98,

13:08.580 --> 13:12.320
emily flyn,found in her
apartment,stabbed 23 times.

13:12.360 --> 13:16.340
Hillary habner,march 2000,found
in her basement,stabbed 18 times.

13:16.370 --> 13:21.210
Cindy stagnal,april 2001,stabbed
multiple times,found in her office.

13:21.250 --> 13:25.590
And may 1999,vanessa bright,29,stabbed
and found in her studio.

13:25.630 --> 13:29.980
Ladies and gentlemen,it appears
as ough we've found our timeline.

13:30.030 --> 13:34.020
It looks like our killer strikes
almost exactly every 12 months.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.350
Oh,my god.

13:35.370 --> 13:38.080
All these women,and he got away with it.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.180
I think we need to inform the media.

13:40.230 --> 13:42.770
Buffalo has a serial killer.

13:43.350 --> 13:46.230
Every so often,he's stopping
and looking down at the ground.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.080
- At what?
- I don't know.

13:48.460 --> 13:51.290
But it's clear he's trying to
step around some type of objects.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.760
There aren't any objects.

13:52.780 --> 13:54.100
Well,at least not the we can see.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.850
But remember in the film he cut
the sandwich and turned it twice?

13:56.890 --> 13:59.510
And the 29th was circled twice in red.

13:59.550 --> 14:02.450
So this isn't a message. This
is something he has to do.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.760
It's the cracks in the pavement.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.240
That's what he's stopping for. He's
stepping over them because he has to.

14:10.260 --> 14:12.030
He's obsessive-compulsive.

14:12.070 --> 14:15.620
Meaning no matter how hard he
tries,he simply can't stop himself.

14:15.670 --> 14:18.420
Well,if he wanted to,he
could have turned himself in.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.420
By writing "help me," he
really means "stop me."

15:03.120 --> 15:04.890
Go away,go away,go away...

15:04.910 --> 15:08.520
Vincent,it's alice. I
know you're in there.

15:09.760 --> 15:13.800
Ok. Just a moment.

15:28.650 --> 15:31.310
How you doing?

15:34.060 --> 15:36.890
Where have you
been,vincent? 'S been weeks.

15:36.910 --> 15:39.200
For a single guy,you're so neat.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.630
- What's in there?
- Nothing.

15:43.820 --> 15:45.700
How did you find me?

15:45.740 --> 15:49.090
I dropped you off after
the conference,remember?

15:50.820 --> 15:52.730
Aren't you gonna offer me a drink?

15:52.770 --> 15:54.440
I'm--I'm
not thirsty.

15:54.460 --> 15:59.260
I--i meant-- you're
weird. But cute.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.350
Alice,you know,it's--
it's not really ok.

16:02.380 --> 16:05.040
It's not really ok that you
just come by my home like this.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.290
You should--you
should go.

16:06.330 --> 16:10.450
No,I came because there's a wedding tomorrow
and they want you to film and edit it.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.430
I mean,you're the best,vincent.

16:12.450 --> 16:16.140
Well,uh,I'm not doing that anymore.

16:16.430 --> 16:18.660
Why?

16:20.690 --> 16:23.810
It's really late,and I'm tired.

16:24.330 --> 16:27.290
You should go,alice,yes,please.

16:30.670 --> 16:33.690
The same suspect. Keep in mind...

16:33.710 --> 16:36.300
Vincent,that looks a lot like you.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.310
And he may use hats or other
means to hide his appearance.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.420
This man has a type.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.570
He kills women,blond women,in their 30s,

16:45.900 --> 16:49.680
and he kills them where they feel safe--
 In their homes,in their workspace...

16:49.700 --> 16:53.230
- Vincent?
- I have to change my glasses.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.210
There was no purse,no
jewelry,nothing to i.d.her with.

17:05.230 --> 17:07.710
Whereas with michelle he
didn't care what he left behind.

17:07.770 --> 17:09.599
He knew we couldn't connect her to him.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.550
Why did he cover her up and
fold her arms across her chest?

17:12.569 --> 17:14.410
She can't be more than 24.

17:14.460 --> 17:15.910
That doesn't fit his victimology.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.589
Well,the chest wound matches
that of michelle watson.

17:18.609 --> 17:21.310
The way he's positioned
her,the blanket,shows remorse.

17:21.349 --> 17:23.170
He probably knew her more
intimately than the others.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.520
That's somewhat of a leap.

17:24.550 --> 17:27.510
Not when you consider this is
the first time he dumped the body.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.970
Unlike the others,he brought
her body here and dumped it.

17:29.990 --> 17:33.140
Yeah. Someone will be missing her soon.

17:33.540 --> 17:36.190
Today's the 29th. He probably
killed her last night.

17:36.210 --> 17:39.370
Whatever his plans
are,he still has them.

17:39.670 --> 17:42.270
We're ready to give the profile.

17:42.790 --> 17:46.980
We've confirmed 11 kills over
a 10-year period. This makes 12.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.090
All but one blond,white female,mid
- to late 30s.

17:51.410 --> 17:53.990
- Be careful.
- Time me.

17:54.710 --> 17:57.080
Stanley,be careful.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.770
This unsub has extreme
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

18:06.790 --> 18:08.490
This woman doesn't fit his victimology.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.760
He probably didn't target
or even mean to kill her.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.350
5 camera shops in buffalo
were shown this sketch.

18:13.390 --> 18:16.780
The owner of tarquinio's camera
shop on union road recognized it.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.750
He knows him only as vincent.

18:18.790 --> 18:23.400
He bought two 3-millimeter mini wireless
cameras and had them retrofitted to his glasses.

18:23.430 --> 18:25.080
He's well-versed in camera technology.

18:25.110 --> 18:27.640
He probably generates
income from a related field.

18:27.670 --> 18:29.650
So stake out the shop,but
keep a low profile.

18:29.720 --> 18:33.760
He walks in off the street,he politely
waits his turn,he pays in cash.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.000
This is him. Black
overcoat,black baseball cap.

18:37.020 --> 18:38.870
You'll get more from your sketch.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.050
Now,this last kill
shows the most remorse.

18:41.080 --> 18:45.320
This guy's mobile. Most likely in
a suv. Low-profile,mute in color.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.230
He's beginning to devolve.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.620
His ocd will get worse and
he'll have a hard time hiding it.

18:50.650 --> 18:54.050
He will take bigger and bigger
risks to achieve his ultimate goal.

18:54.070 --> 18:57.700
In michelle's watson's day
planner,he circled the number 29.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.390
Today is the 29th.

18:59.430 --> 19:02.230
So we believe he may have
something planned for today.

19:07.390 --> 19:09.850
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

19:21.790 --> 19:24.150
He sent us this film as
his way of reaching out.

19:24.190 --> 19:26.840
He may be ambivalent,but
his ocd won't let him stop.

19:26.880 --> 19:30.530
Now,if he sees a heavy police
presence and he's not done,he'll run.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.600
The east side is his comfort
zone. This is where he lives.

19:33.620 --> 19:37.500
However random,anything out of
the ordinary,please let us know.

19:37.530 --> 19:39.480
Thank you very much.

19:40.290 --> 19:42.690
Tell me again what the
autopsy report said.

19:42.710 --> 19:44.710
He seems to be killing once a year.

19:44.760 --> 19:48.170
And they were all,except
for michelle watson,overkill.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.490
He stabbed her just once.

19:49.530 --> 19:51.890
And hers was the only kill he
sent footage of to the police.

19:51.930 --> 19:54.010
- That's a definitive change.
- You're right.

19:54.030 --> 19:56.180
Call reid and prentiss. Tell them
to go over the autopsy report again.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.500
We need to know why.

20:02.980 --> 20:05.010
He sure does like his blondes.

20:05.030 --> 20:07.200
Not a good date,though. Too stabby.

20:07.220 --> 20:10.000
Less so,though,with michelle watson
and the girl we found this morning.

20:10.040 --> 20:13.340
Every one of these murders
happens during a month of spring.

20:13.370 --> 20:16.270
So,spring for the unsub is a stressor.

20:17.190 --> 20:19.170
Do you think my video
was done in the spring?

20:19.200 --> 20:20.990
- There's a good chance.
- Ok.

20:21.010 --> 20:23.310
Eighties,spring,buffalo.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.910
Search for homicide,see
if I can make a connection.

20:25.940 --> 20:29.910
All of the victims except for michelle watson
were killed within a year of each other.

20:29.950 --> 20:33.620
Victim number 10,joyce
wolcott,stabbed 32 times.

20:33.660 --> 20:36.730
And then michelle watson was
stabbed just once 2 years later.

20:36.790 --> 20:40.880
What's missing from the michelle watson
murder is any sign of rage or overkill.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.430
Yeah. Instead,on the tape
we see signs of remorse.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.630
A complete and sudden emotional
change. It's absolutely fascinating.

20:46.650 --> 20:49.840
I loveou,reid,but the stuff
you find fascinating is sad.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.160
Ok. The woman in my video...

20:52.180 --> 20:54.690
She looks a lot like the ones
on your board,don't you think?

20:54.730 --> 20:56.580
So he's killing her over and over again.

20:56.610 --> 20:58.670
Maybe. I don't know. Not my job.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.230
Guys,there was an actual witness
In the jce wolcott murder.

21:01.250 --> 21:04.750
- a witness?
- A boy. Her son.

21:21.490 --> 21:24.090
53 seconds. You were faster
the first time. What happened?

21:24.110 --> 21:26.420
Ran over a cat.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.180
- Did you kill it?
- It's a joke. I'm joking.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.820
I know.

21:35.790 --> 21:37.340
Happy birthday,stanley.

21:37.370 --> 21:39.680
- King for the day,right,vincent?
- Right.

21:42.210 --> 21:44.100
I made you a promise.
Do you remember it?

21:44.120 --> 21:45.540
Of course.

21:45.580 --> 21:48.470
So hold out your hand,palm up.

21:52.180 --> 21:55.360
No way. For real?

21:55.380 --> 21:57.130
Tonight. It's here tonight.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.870
But you can't tell
anyone,ok? Just tell no one.

21:59.890 --> 22:02.190
- You promise?
- Promise. No one.

22:04.290 --> 22:07.410
- So listen out for me,ok?
- Ok.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.190
Hey,vincent.

22:11.220 --> 22:14.490
You know nothing will happen
if you step on them,right?

22:16.510 --> 22:18.740
You're a kid. What do you know?

22:21.800 --> 22:25.190
Neighbors called the police when they
heard her son stan screaming for his mother.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.540
Let's see,they were found in
the backyard and she was dead.

22:27.570 --> 22:28.880
So he saw the whole thing?

22:28.920 --> 22:32.370
If he did,why didn't the unsub
kill the only living witness?

22:32.390 --> 22:34.860
- Did they interview him?
- He was traumatized.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.710
- Did he see the killer?
- He didn't see anything.

22:38.330 --> 22:39.600
Where is the boy now?

22:39.640 --> 22:43.250
Single mom,father
dead in a car accident.

22:43.270 --> 22:45.280
He was foster-homed after her death.

22:45.310 --> 22:47.280
Tell me he's still in buffalo.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.150
Yes.

22:55.970 --> 22:57.560
How you doing there,kid?

22:57.580 --> 22:59.090
We're looking for stanley wolcott.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.750
Who wants to know?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.910
My name's derek morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

23:02.930 --> 23:04.870
FBI? Cool.

23:06.270 --> 23:08.420
Today's your birthday,right?

23:09.550 --> 23:12.040
- Can I help you?
- FBI.

23:13.090 --> 23:15.070
I'm sorry to do this today of all days.

23:15.090 --> 23:18.960
But we need to talk to
stanley. It's urgent.

24:05.460 --> 24:08.740
Stanley's been with me for 9 months now.

24:08.760 --> 24:11.430
The adoption papers
came tough last week.

24:11.490 --> 24:13.400
So we're moving to california.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.660
Uh,stanley's been blind since birth.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.800
His mom didn't want him
to use a cane,so,he,uh...

24:20.140 --> 24:21.420
My way around life.

24:21.450 --> 24:23.490
It's called echolocation.

24:23.530 --> 24:27.870
It's where the sound bounces off
objects,kind of like a bat uses sonar.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.080
I'm the batman.

24:31.350 --> 24:32.740
Well,hey,batman.

24:32.790 --> 24:37.110
Self and my colleague here,dave,we
need to ask you some questions.

24:41.050 --> 24:43.380
This is about my mom,isn't it?

24:43.400 --> 24:45.600
Yeah,it is.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.720
- And I need to ask you--
 - Have you found him?

24:51.040 --> 24:53.450
I can feel a lie.

24:56.210 --> 24:58.890
We're looking for him,stan.

24:58.910 --> 25:00.580
We could use your help.

25:00.620 --> 25:03.920
Now,what I'm asking you to
do probably won't be easy.

25:04.930 --> 25:06.840
- Will it help you catch him?
- It might.

25:06.860 --> 25:08.360
I'm not sure about this.

25:08.400 --> 25:12.290
It ok. I want to.

25:16.950 --> 25:18.820
That a boy.

25:19.360 --> 25:25.170
Ok. 2 years ago,on that night,you
were playing in the snow with your mom.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.300
She said my lips were turning blue.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.960
She told me to go in and get warm.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.610
She said it was getting dark.

25:37.580 --> 25:42.300
So then you came inside and
you took off your gloves.

25:42.320 --> 25:46.030
You took off your
jacket. And you got warm.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.850
But after a while,she
didn't come back in.

25:48.870 --> 25:52.050
Mom? Mom?

25:52.070 --> 25:53.990
Stanley,what do you hear?

25:54.010 --> 25:56.600
The snow is so thick.

25:56.620 --> 26:00.420
It covers the house,the yard.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.220
Everything's so quiet.

26:03.260 --> 26:05.830
You call out for her,but
she doesn't call back.

26:05.850 --> 26:08.780
Mom? Mom!

26:10.670 --> 26:12.470
Now I hear something.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.030
What do you hear?

26:14.060 --> 26:16.370
I think I can hear my mom.

26:16.390 --> 26:18.210
Is she talking?

26:20.440 --> 26:22.690
Crying.

26:22.710 --> 26:24.830
Now what do you do?

26:24.870 --> 26:26.690
Go outside.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.860
Stanley,we can stop doing
this now if you want.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.980
No. It's ok. I can do this.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.130
You're doing good,stanley.
You're doing really good.

26:38.150 --> 26:40.260
I'm right here,ok?

26:42.240 --> 26:44.530
Mom?

26:48.910 --> 26:50.520
Can you hear her?

26:50.550 --> 26:53.830
No. I need to find her.

26:55.870 --> 26:57.770
Mom?

27:01.650 --> 27:04.330
- Stanley...
- Someone's here.

27:04.850 --> 27:07.350
I can feel them.

27:07.630 --> 27:10.140
It's not my mom.

27:12.680 --> 27:16.220
That's enough. Enough. That's enough.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.190
He saw me... Didn't he?

27:24.550 --> 27:27.500
Yes,stan,he did.

27:51.910 --> 27:55.060
Hey,what's up,man? Looks like
you know where you're going.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.920
- I don't want any trouble.
- See,I don't know you.

28:02.510 --> 28:05.050
- I don't want any trouble.
- Look,you said that twice.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.290
What you doin' walkin'
around here,anyway,huh?

28:08.190 --> 28:10.620
You ain't lost.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.680
Hey,man. Hey,look at me.

28:15.430 --> 28:19.480
All right,come on. You walk like you know where
you're going,so you gotta know what's next.

28:20.020 --> 28:22.280
See,this here's my street.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.170
And you pay to walk on my street.

29:38.850 --> 29:41.050
I've been thinking about you all day.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.560
You shouldn't have been.

30:07.270 --> 30:11.250
- What the hell is this? Get out of my house!
- No,wait.

30:11.640 --> 30:15.660
How can you do this with
our son in the house?

30:16.180 --> 30:19.280
So what? I don't care.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.330
I hate you!

30:21.350 --> 30:25.080
I hate you! I hate my life!

30:35.860 --> 30:38.150
Mom?

30:40.640 --> 30:43.870
Mommy! Mom?

30:55.110 --> 30:56.920
He just came out of
nowhere. He rolled up on us.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.970
- Which way was he walking?
- That way.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.020
He's heading east.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.480
So your friend shot him,the man
defended himself,and you did nothing?

31:03.510 --> 31:05.470
You ran away and called 911?

31:05.490 --> 31:08.830
I'd done talking,fed.
I ain't saying nothin'.

31:08.850 --> 31:10.690
I want my lawyer.

31:10.730 --> 31:13.050
You'll get a lawyer. Answer my question.

31:13.990 --> 31:15.650
- He shot him once.
- Where?

31:15.670 --> 31:16.530
In the stomach.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.390
What was he doing when
you rolled up on him?

31:18.430 --> 31:21.870
Head down,walking real fast,like
he was late for something.

31:21.910 --> 31:23.580
So you jumped him.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.960
When he didn't give you what
you wanted,what did he do?

31:25.990 --> 31:27.380
At first nothing.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.500
He just started making
this noise with his tongue.

31:29.550 --> 31:31.950
- What kind of noise?
- Ok,listen to me.

31:32.730 --> 31:35.170
Yeah,like that. Exactly like that.

31:35.190 --> 31:38.370
And he slammed jay with a knife
and turned and came after me.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.760
It's called echolocation.

31:39.790 --> 31:44.750
The unsub's 10th victim-- she left behind a
blind son who uses echolocation to get around.

31:44.780 --> 31:46.020
How would the killer know that?

31:46.050 --> 31:48.400
Because he saw the boy was blind
the night he killed his mother.

31:48.420 --> 31:51.150
And I think that's why
he didn't kill the boy.

31:51.490 --> 31:55.470
Wait a second. Today's that
kid's birthday. He's the event.

31:55.490 --> 31:59.720
Henderson,get units to meet us
at 6518 cantwell drive right now.

32:07.380 --> 32:10.620
He's gone! He's gone. I thought he
was in his room. He said he was tired.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.850
- When was the last time you checked on him?
- 20 minutes ago.

32:12.870 --> 32:14.600
- Did you hear anything?
- I just don't understand.

32:14.620 --> 32:17.070
- He would have had to pass me to get out.
- Kate,think.

32:17.090 --> 32:19.180
When you checked on
stan,he was asleep,yes?

32:19.200 --> 32:20.330
He was under the covers.

32:20.360 --> 32:23.300
You closed his door. You went
to your room. You settled down.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.550
- I watched tv.
- Did you hear anything?

32:25.570 --> 32:28.390
I,um,I heard a car horn beep twice.

32:28.430 --> 32:30.050
I looked out the window,but
I didn't see anything.

32:30.070 --> 32:32.610
- He's gotta have 20 minutes on us.
- Oh,god.

32:32.630 --> 32:34.410
Oh,my god,he's gonna kill him,isn't he?

32:34.460 --> 32:36.620
Let's just take a look inside.

32:43.810 --> 32:45.700
Are you ok?

32:48.950 --> 32:51.670
The FBI came to my house.

32:55.770 --> 32:57.230
The FBI.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.300
The man that killed my mom...

33:00.100 --> 33:03.590
He stood right next to me,in the snow.

33:03.960 --> 33:07.220
He could have killed me,but he didn't.

33:08.670 --> 33:11.190
Well,maybe he saw something in you.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.890
Well,what did he see?

33:16.960 --> 33:18.960
I don't know.

33:18.980 --> 33:21.070
But,uh...

33:21.090 --> 33:23.650
You know,it stopped him.

33:23.670 --> 33:26.260
Stopped him from hurting you.

33:27.430 --> 33:29.840
He's back.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.430
He did a bad thing.

33:34.460 --> 33:37.840
He did a--he did a very--
 A very bad thing,but...

33:39.070 --> 33:41.790
When he saw you,he knew...

33:43.180 --> 33:46.720
He knew that he couldn't
hurt you. He knew that...

33:48.510 --> 33:51.860
He'll never-- he'll
never ever hurt you.

33:55.460 --> 33:58.020
I wish he'd killed me.

34:29.489 --> 34:30.590
There's blood here.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.620
- Oh,no,please.
- It's not stan.

34:32.639 --> 34:35.870
We believe the man who took
stan was injured. It's his blood.

34:35.889 --> 34:38.170
We think his name is vincent.

34:38.190 --> 34:39.840
- Vincent?
- You know him?

34:39.860 --> 34:41.610
Stan knew him before he came to me.

34:41.639 --> 34:43.380
- For how long?
- For over a year.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.159
He was a registered helper
in a mentoring program.

34:46.190 --> 34:49.300
- Which one?
- Oh,god. Stan has belonged to so many programs.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.050
I can't remember where he met vincent.

34:52.070 --> 34:54.190
Garcia,I got a
name--vincent.

34:54.230 --> 34:56.179
Morgan,I'm gonna need a surname,honey.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.570
She can't remember.

34:57.610 --> 35:02.100
Can you at least cross-reference vincent's name
with all of the mentor organizations in buffalo?

35:02.130 --> 35:04.010
I think we'll get more from the video.

35:04.050 --> 35:05.100
We're running out of time.

35:05.150 --> 35:06.610
Come on,garcia,we gotta find this kid.

35:06.630 --> 35:09.130
Trust me,ok? Give me a second.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.700
That's her. That's the
woman from the film.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.980
June 5,1983.

35:15.020 --> 35:17.600
Kim rowlings was killed in her home.

35:17.640 --> 35:20.590
When police arrived,they
found her son vincent rowlings.

35:20.630 --> 35:22.690
- Garcia--  - thank me
when we've got an address.

35:22.710 --> 35:25.390
Vincent was found sitting with
the body of his murdered mother.

35:25.430 --> 35:28.230
Police believe that he sat
with her for more than 24 hours.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.380
He was only 9 years old.

35:30.410 --> 35:34.370
He filmed his mother's murder and hid
the tape from the police all these yearS.

35:34.390 --> 35:37.500
vincent rowlings, 5605 1/2
pearl street,east side,buffalo.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.000
Tell hotch we're en route. I love you.

35:40.020 --> 35:41.980
FBI!

35:46.170 --> 35:48.310
Clear.

35:48.330 --> 35:53.900
I hate you! I hate you! I hate my life!

35:55.270 --> 35:57.480
Get off of me!

36:05.780 --> 36:08.540
Garcia,I need you to
conference everybody now.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.570
Hotch,you've got rossi and morgan.

36:10.620 --> 36:12.630
And we have stan's
foster mother kate here.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.130
Stanley is missing,and there's
blood on the windowsill.

36:15.150 --> 36:17.340
Kate,did vincent take stan out?

36:17.370 --> 36:19.400
Was there a favorite
place they liked to go?

36:19.430 --> 36:20.630
A park? Playground?

36:20.650 --> 36:25.880
No. No. Like I said,I only allow him to see
stan under this roof,under my supervision.

36:25.900 --> 36:28.510
He's been coming around more since
I told him we were moving away.

36:28.550 --> 36:30.270
When did you tell vincent that?

36:30.310 --> 36:32.190
Like a week ago. Why?

36:32.470 --> 36:35.600
- What?
- He killed michelle watson over a week ago.

36:35.620 --> 36:38.930
That must be the stressor that
triggered vincent's behavior change.

36:39.490 --> 36:43.070
Kate,vincent's drawn the number 29
with a circle around it numerous times.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.700
Today is the 29th.

36:44.750 --> 36:48.270
We believe the circle may
represent a specific location.

36:48.320 --> 36:51.080
They would have talked about it,or he
might even have taken him there before.

36:51.110 --> 36:53.640
Did vincent talk to stan about
adventures that they could take?

36:53.670 --> 36:54.960
Places they could visit?

36:55.000 --> 36:56.700
What are stanley's
favorite things to do?

36:56.740 --> 37:00.900
He just likes to make things. To
build things. Vincent used to help him.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.780
- The construction sets?
- Yeah.

37:07.830 --> 37:09.860
Ferris wheel. It's a circle.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.420
When did he build this?

37:11.460 --> 37:13.870
Over the last couple of months.
He's been in here every night.

37:13.890 --> 37:18.060
Garcia,check buffalo and the surrounding areas
for any theme parks,permanent or visiting.

37:19.410 --> 37:22.260
- Theme park just outside of buffalo.
- Ferris wheel?

37:23.830 --> 37:25.320
Yes!

37:25.340 --> 37:26.850
Let's go.

37:26.890 --> 37:28.930
You both go. I'll stay
here in case he comes back.

37:28.950 --> 37:31.260
I want to go over everything and
see how many others we've missed.

37:31.300 --> 37:33.360
Got it.

37:46.060 --> 37:48.120
What do you see?

37:48.140 --> 37:50.920
Tell me,vincent. What do you see?

37:52.170 --> 37:54.570
So many colors.

37:54.590 --> 37:56.840
Lights everywhere.

37:56.860 --> 37:59.440
Is it here? The ferris wheel?

38:00.310 --> 38:01.930
It's here. It's...

38:02.200 --> 38:04.810
Is it like the one we built? Is it?

38:06.060 --> 38:07.590
Exactly.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.780
Then let's go.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.060
- Are you ok,buddy?
- Yeah.

38:28.410 --> 38:30.680
I just get a little nervous at heights.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.570
Just don't look down.

38:34.940 --> 38:39.890
He,uh,he wants to stop it at
the top. C-can you do that?

38:39.910 --> 38:41.610
Yeah,sure.

38:41.650 --> 38:44.810
Just close your eyes. Like me.

38:49.780 --> 38:52.060
It's going up.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.070
Move! FBI! Out of the way!

39:11.330 --> 39:13.520
Is it beautiful?

39:13.900 --> 39:16.400
Can you see the stars,vincent?

39:16.650 --> 39:18.150
Can you see the stars?

39:18.180 --> 39:19.890
There's thousands of them.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.150
They're all over the sky.

39:23.610 --> 39:26.540
I bet if you lean forward,you
can reach for them.

39:29.140 --> 39:31.160
I got you.

39:35.590 --> 39:38.620
Remember you said you'd
wished he'd killed you?

39:45.800 --> 39:48.830
- He's up top!
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

39:48.850 --> 39:52.410
You can never,ever wish to be dead.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.360
Never wish for that.

40:03.380 --> 40:05.930
I saw my mom die,too.

40:08.650 --> 40:12.800
And like my father,I did some
bad things. I did some bad things.

40:13.610 --> 40:15.780
What are you talking about?

40:16.800 --> 40:19.080
You're gonna hear things.

40:20.610 --> 40:23.660
You're gonna hear bad things about me.

40:24.600 --> 40:28.770
But you can never,ever wish to die,stan.

40:31.580 --> 40:34.030
Because you're special.

40:34.050 --> 40:36.600
How am I special?

40:55.840 --> 41:00.960
Because you helped me to see. To see.

41:03.700 --> 41:06.830
Can--can we go
around one more time?

41:08.780 --> 41:11.780
I need you to get this kid
off the wheel. Do it now.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.480
I don't think so.

41:17.870 --> 41:20.700
I wish you were my dad.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.950
Forgive me.

41:24.230 --> 41:26.760
Do it now!

41:33.510 --> 41:35.740
Ok,stop there.

41:38.220 --> 41:42.010
Now open it. Stanley,it's
derek from the FBI.

41:42.030 --> 41:44.200
It's ok. Sit
tight. Stanley--

41:44.220 --> 41:47.320
- What's going on?
- It's me,derek.

41:48.950 --> 41:51.580
- Vincent,what's--  What's
going on? - Listen to me.

41:51.600 --> 41:54.250
I need you to come with
me. Let go of vincent.

41:54.270 --> 41:57.070
Just come with me. I'm
getting you out of here.

41:57.090 --> 42:02.410
That's right. That's right.
It's gonna be ok. You're ok.

42:02.430 --> 42:04.490
Vincent?

42:13.810 --> 42:15.550
It's ok. It's fine.

42:15.570 --> 42:17.680
Oh,honey!

42:25.990 --> 42:27.850
Derek.

42:32.930 --> 42:35.180
What's up,kid?

42:41.190 --> 42:43.510
Did he kill my mom?

43:07.490 --> 43:11.670
"no matter how dark the moment,
love and hope are always possible."

43:11.680 --> 43:13.410
