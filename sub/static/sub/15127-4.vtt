00:02.500 --> 00:03.490
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

00:03.500 --> 00:07.490
It has been three months
since my last confession.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.490
And you come now to accuse yourself?

00:09.500 --> 00:10.490
I do, Father.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.500
Of which sin, my son?

00:12.500 --> 00:14.500
I am a liar.

Does the bastard breathe?

02:03.500 --> 02:05.490
Nothing. Clutched
at himself then fell.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.490
There is a God.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.500
Who here would help a true patriot?

02:11.500 --> 02:14.490
A humble man wronged
by the cruel iniquities

02:14.500 --> 02:16.500
of this uncaring government?

02:18.500 --> 02:21.490
A brother - a warrior for justice!

02:21.500 --> 02:23.500
Who would help me?

02:26.500 --> 02:28.490
The keys?

02:28.500 --> 02:29.490
Will you not give me the keys?

02:29.500 --> 02:32.490
Are ye men, or are ye mice?

Are ye Irish men and women or not?

If not now, then never!

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
Maith an buachaill. Good lad.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.500
Ah. What do you call
a dead Englishmen?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.490
A good start.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.500
Maith an fear. Eirinn go Brach.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.500
Jesus.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.500
Is this to be laid
at your door? Huh?

03:16.500 --> 03:19.500
The balls on you
would shame an elephant.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.490
I hope you were not bored,
Inspector.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.490
Oh, by no means, Miss Cobden.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.490
They come with a fervour,
your friends.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.490
They are not my friends.
They befriend me.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.490
There is a difference.

03:31.500 --> 03:35.490
The settlement movement - men and
women raised in the gracious avenues

03:35.500 --> 03:39.490
of Bath or the rolling Surrey
Downs, now making their home here.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.490
In the hope that the benighted souls
they now rub against might

03:42.500 --> 03:44.490
somehow be elevated
by such noble contact.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.490
And you doubt their sincerity?

03:46.500 --> 03:49.490
I doubt their efficacity. If people
wish to improve conditions...

03:49.500 --> 03:51.490
And you do not wish for
improvement in people's lives?

03:51.500 --> 03:55.500
No, I... Of course.
I fear they will be disappointed.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.490
Men, I find. And women?

03:58.500 --> 04:00.500
Yes. They too.

04:01.500 --> 04:05.490
In my experience,
humans more often choose to

04:05.500 --> 04:09.490
resist transformation
than embrace it.

04:09.500 --> 04:15.490
And you, Inspector. I invite
you to an audience with a...

04:15.500 --> 04:18.490
over-educated cabal
of reformers and idealists

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
and you choose to attend.

04:21.500 --> 04:25.500
Why, surely that is a transformation
of sorts, is it not?

04:26.500 --> 04:29.500
Inspector Reid! You're wanted, sir.

04:30.500 --> 04:37.500
Miss Cobden, my thanks. Time
with you is, as ever, educative.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.490
Ah, Inspector.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.490
Fresh from the admiring attentions

04:49.500 --> 04:52.490
of the councillor
for Bow and Bromley?

04:52.500 --> 04:54.490
Sergeant.
This is our Newgate driver?

04:54.500 --> 04:55.490
Yes, sir. Morris.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.490
Fell from the seat of the Maria as
it passed underneath a clothesline.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.490
Moved no more. Convict calls
for assistance. A boy obliges.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.490
He frees himself - scarpers.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.490
Any reports from the community
on either boy or prisoner?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.490
Irish round there.
Shut up like an oyster.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
This one, I pronounce...

05:13.500 --> 05:14.490
..dead.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.490
No clubbing,
no shooting, no stabbing.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.490
Heart failure, most likely.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.490
But I'm going to open him up
and I'm going to get you sure.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.490
So what was it - opportunism?
A stroke of luck for the escapee?

05:24.500 --> 05:25.490
Do we have a name?

05:25.500 --> 05:27.490
We do, sir.

05:27.500 --> 05:32.490
Aiden Galvin. Incarcerated
at our pleasure since 1868.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.490
Irish Republican Brotherhood.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.490
Sent down with eight other
members of the IRB after

05:37.500 --> 05:38.490
the Clerkenwell bombing.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.490
Flat-head Fenians tried
to dynamite a prison.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.490
Blew a crater out the street
next door in its stead.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.490
12 dead - civilians.
Murdered at his hand.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.490
It is a pitiless killer
who now walks free.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.490
But, sir, he has not walked abroad
in this city for over 20 years.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.490
He will be swiftly found.
And your method in so doing, Flight?

05:55.500 --> 05:58.490
We roust the Whitechapel Irish,
Inspector.

05:58.500 --> 06:02.490
And the thought of that action
sits easy with you, does it?

06:02.500 --> 06:04.500
I know what side I stand on, sir.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.490
Sergeant, take a squad of men also.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.490
The years roll round,

06:11.500 --> 06:15.500
yet it is ever Irish
heads on the end of my club.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.490
Police!

06:21.500 --> 06:24.490
Now, everybody stay calm. We're
just having a little look around.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.490
Get out, English pigs!
Evening, Irish scum.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.490
Watch your mouth, pig!
All right then.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
SHOUTING

06:32.500 --> 06:33.490
And so it goes.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.500
SHOUTING AND SCREAMING

06:41.500 --> 06:42.490
You! Bulldog Boy!

06:42.500 --> 06:44.490
Have you not walked the streets
the last three years?

06:44.500 --> 06:47.490
The IRB has given up its guns.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.490
The days when a Fenian
could be found

06:49.500 --> 06:51.490
hid in a cider barrel are past.
We live in peace, now.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.490
There's a prisoner
on the loose, girl.

06:53.500 --> 06:58.490
IRB with a taste for nothing but the
bloody destruction of innocent life.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.490
You're one to talk.
The look in your eye -

07:00.500 --> 07:03.500
you've quite a taste
for it yourself.

07:04.500 --> 07:08.500
His name is Galvin.
Once, he laid dynamite.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.490
Now, we will search this house
and you will move aside.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
Or you will know
prison life yourself.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.500
Thank you.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.490
Although one must be careful
of these bohemians, Reid.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.490
I mean, they promise much,
certainly,

07:27.500 --> 07:29.490
but that casual air of impudence,

07:29.500 --> 07:32.490
it is more often a disguise,
I've found, for what can only be

07:32.500 --> 07:38.500
described as a chilly disinclination
when proceedings come to a point.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.500
Captain, tell me. I am curious.

07:42.500 --> 07:46.490
We are now both well enough known
to each other, you and I.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.490
Indeed, there are sides to our
lives shared with few others

07:49.500 --> 07:53.490
and yet you persist
in this ceaseless goading.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
Why do you suppose this is so?

07:56.500 --> 08:01.490
Because we're men, Reid,
and that is what men do.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.490
We needle and we goad

08:03.500 --> 08:07.490
because if we did not, we would be
forced to speak the truth.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.500
Suppose for just one moment
that was not the...

08:11.500 --> 08:14.490
Suppose for one minute,
that was not the case.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.500
What would the truth say?
The truth?

08:17.500 --> 08:19.490
That the good councillor
fits with you.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.490
That the two of you look
right together.

08:21.500 --> 08:27.500
And that I am sorry that
your life is not less...complex.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.490
And you needn't concern yourself
with conspiracies.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.490
At least, not as far
as this man is concerned.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.490
He got fluid in the lungs,
atheroma of the coronary arteries,

08:39.500 --> 08:42.490
infarction of the myocardium.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.500
His heart collapsed on him.
Your convict got lucky.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.500
You have your mother's way
with the pot still, I see.

09:05.500 --> 09:09.500
Is it you, Aiden Galvin?
It is, Evelyn.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.500
My wee girl, Evelyn.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.490
You're hunted.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
It is a change to be wanted,
I can tell you.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.490
Yet another evil of
this bastard government,

09:28.500 --> 09:30.490
that they kept me from you.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.490
And this government you speak of,

09:33.500 --> 09:35.490
it prevents you from
writing letters also?

09:35.500 --> 09:39.490
I am not the letter-writing kind,
Evelyn. No.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.500
You are the gunpowder-plotting kind.

09:44.500 --> 09:48.490
So what'll you do now, Aiden,
before the police find you

09:48.500 --> 09:50.490
and tear your skin from you?

09:50.500 --> 09:53.490
There are one or two
errands I must run.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.490
And then there is you.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.490
I would know you.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.500
Help you, if I can.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.490
Are you happy, Evie?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.500
Is your life what you would wish it?

10:07.500 --> 10:08.500
I live here, don't I?

10:10.500 --> 10:11.490
What do you think?

10:11.500 --> 10:12.490
You would leave this place?

10:12.500 --> 10:14.490
Who, given the choice, would stay?

10:14.500 --> 10:17.490
Aye, it is the arsehole
of the world, is it not?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.490
With your permission,

10:18.500 --> 10:21.500
I will have to see about removing
the pair of us from it.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
Mr Parnell.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.490
The acceptable face of Ireland.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.490
A Protestant.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.490
Trust him, we are told.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
Trust an Irishman?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.490
I would sooner play chess
with an Orang-utan.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
LAUGHTER

11:01.500 --> 11:04.490
I was 20 years with
the Irish Constabulary

11:04.500 --> 11:05.490
and I will tell you this -

11:05.500 --> 11:09.490
the Irishman
is a Negro turned inside out.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.500
Given only to slavishness
and violence.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.490
The Irishman harps on freedom.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.490
Freedom to do what, exactly?

11:26.500 --> 11:32.490
Shoot landowners, thieve livestock,
explode dynamite.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.490
Hear, hear.

11:33.500 --> 11:37.490
The Irishman was put on this earth
to be ruled and it is up to us,

11:37.500 --> 11:39.490
gentlemen, to rule him.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.490
Quite so! Hear, hear.
I am for my rest.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.500
Sleep well, Knightly. Good night.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.500
I wish agonies on you, Mr Knightly,
and in hell soon.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.490
Bastards.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.500
EXPLOSION

12:42.500 --> 12:45.500
DISTANT: Quick. Need some help!

12:57.500 --> 12:58.500
Inspector Reid!

13:01.500 --> 13:04.500
This for your tame Pinkerton.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.490
And you, Inspector, are with me.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.490
A convicted Brotherhood man
is sprung from these streets,

13:10.500 --> 13:12.490
and you thought not to say?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.490
Hardly sprung, Fred.
The driver's heart failed.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.490
Galvin has been in
a cell for over 20 years -

13:17.500 --> 13:18.490
I'm sure he can
barely piss straight.

13:18.500 --> 13:22.490
His physical condition
is not germane, Inspector.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.490
How do you think this plays?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.490
It is, "Whitechapel frees
Irish dynamite

13:26.500 --> 13:28.500
"and blows it back to London."

13:30.500 --> 13:34.490
Michael Donovan, IRB. Centre
point of the Whitechapel Circle.

13:34.500 --> 13:38.490
Mr Abberline, our masters
meet in banquet halls.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.490
The IRB is now a recognised
political party that

13:40.500 --> 13:43.490
negotiates with your government.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.490
The days when such men
as ourselves convened in such

13:46.500 --> 13:49.490
places as this to take secrets
off each other are in the past.

13:49.500 --> 13:53.500
And yet, here I am, dragged from my
breakfast to converse with you here.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.490
Yourself, and...?

13:56.500 --> 13:58.500
Reid. H Division.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.490
And you, boy,
are not a man such as I.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.490
We should have begun this task
one day ago, Edmund!

14:07.500 --> 14:09.490
This is an act of war, sir.

14:09.500 --> 14:13.490
No, Michael. It is a retaliation.

14:13.500 --> 14:17.490
This, found beside
the charred remains

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
of a Member of our Parliament.

14:20.500 --> 14:24.500
A one-time Inspector General
of the Royal Irish Constabulary.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.490
His escape was not
sanctioned by leadership.

14:33.500 --> 14:37.490
The man Galvin is
not affiliated. Not no more.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.490
The position of my leadership
still stands.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.490
We are for home rule
by peaceful means.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.490
Michael, your little knackers

14:44.500 --> 14:47.490
were still being felt
by Father O'Hoolahan

14:47.500 --> 14:51.490
when Aiden Galvin was plotting
to blow holes in my city.

14:51.500 --> 14:55.490
Man like that is never for peace.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.490
I am old...

14:58.500 --> 15:05.500
but I know yet when an
Irisher feeds me horse shit.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.490
Where will he go?

15:10.500 --> 15:12.490
I don't know.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.500
Please!

15:17.500 --> 15:19.490
Nyaaaaaarrrgh!

15:19.500 --> 15:21.490
Aaargh!

15:21.500 --> 15:22.500
He has a daughter!

15:24.500 --> 15:25.490
Gaaargh!

15:25.500 --> 15:28.490
Evelyn Foley.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.490
Barmaid at the Black Rose.

15:29.500 --> 15:33.490
Good lad, Michael. Good lad.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.490
No, Fred. He is yet too green.

15:34.500 --> 15:38.490
Nonetheless, in the time available,
he is the best we have.

15:38.500 --> 15:42.490
Detective Flight's face is right,
his is voice righter still.

15:42.500 --> 15:46.490
He may sit beside her, watch
for Galvin, discern his purpose,

15:46.500 --> 15:49.490
if indeed he does seek her out.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.490
I have not forgot
the boy you lost last year, Edmund.

15:53.500 --> 15:57.490
But you will lose more
before this life is out

15:57.500 --> 15:59.500
and nothing to be done to
change that fact.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.500
You oblige me, Inspector.

16:06.500 --> 16:10.490
Flight, this man, Galvin.
There is a daughter, we are told.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.490
Her mother, a woman named Foley.
Bethan Foley.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.490
I shall get to the archives, sir -
see what might be found.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.500
No, Flight.
Sergeant Artherton will manage.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.500
Chief Inspector Abberline
has work for you.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
If you've the chops for it, son.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.500
Yes, sir, I have.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.490
What is it you do
to our Newgate driver?

16:56.500 --> 16:58.490
There's a link here Reid.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.490
Your detonator was charged
with a Leyden Jar.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.490
It's a glass bottle
with silver sheeting around it,

17:04.500 --> 17:05.490
set to carry current.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.490
Knightly lays back
in his bed to rest,

17:08.500 --> 17:13.490
the bed springs depress,
connects the circuit,

17:13.500 --> 17:17.490
then, boom! Electricity.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.490
Which is interesting, because now
we have to ask ourselves

17:20.500 --> 17:25.490
if our convict was freed with
the design of laying this charge

17:25.500 --> 17:27.490
beneath Knightly's bed.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.490
That, is a shock scar.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.490
What, and sufficient to
cause his heart to give up?

17:31.500 --> 17:33.500
Well, it is a vulnerable organ.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.490
The charge would have
needed to be significant,

17:38.500 --> 17:41.490
however, and conducted into him
I know not how.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.500
With me, Sergeant.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.500
The Maria makes its way along.
Where did it stop?

17:55.500 --> 17:56.500
Somewhere here.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
Let's take a look, shall we?

18:13.500 --> 18:16.500
Leyden Jars. Attached to
the washing line. Pull it in.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.490
So this falls upon our driver.

18:27.500 --> 18:31.490
They would have needed, say,
nine cells of two-pint jars each,

18:31.500 --> 18:34.490
to deliver a shock strong
enough to kill a man.

18:34.500 --> 18:37.490
And what we thought chance
is now plotted conspiracy.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.490
Quite so. But by the IRB? No.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.490
When they kill they do so to
scream their grievance aloud.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.490
They would never disguise
their purpose in this way.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.490
The murdered MP, Knightly, known for
his vicious prejudice, certainly.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.490
But I would like to know who else,
apart from the IRB,

18:53.500 --> 18:55.490
might celebrate his death.

18:55.500 --> 18:59.500
INDISTINCT CHATTER

19:00.500 --> 19:02.500
LOW CHATTER

19:22.500 --> 19:24.490
Yes, friend?

19:24.500 --> 19:27.500
Er...a lemonade. Thank you.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.500
Whatever's your poison.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.500

Michael, what happened?
Did your pigeons turn on you?

20:14.500 --> 20:17.490
A word with you, Evie. In private.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.490
As you can see, we've a crowd in.
Will you return in an hour?

20:19.500 --> 20:21.500
Now!

20:24.500 --> 20:26.490
Outside.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.500
Well, if you'll make a scene...

20:36.500 --> 20:39.490
Your pa will be needing food and
shelter. He will not be able to rely

20:39.500 --> 20:43.490
on the IRB for such support. And
where else will he come other than

20:43.500 --> 20:46.490
to see how his wee girl has grown?

20:46.500 --> 20:48.490
20 years. More than.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.490
And not a single communication
of affection is delivered to me

20:51.500 --> 20:52.490
from behind those bars.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.490
Why would he remain in this city
when a boat for Bantry Bay

20:55.500 --> 20:57.490
or Ellis Island might
be his for the boarding?

20:57.500 --> 21:00.490
Because he has a taste
for murdering Englishmen

21:00.500 --> 21:02.500
when the IRB dictates that such
actions are of the past.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.490
He may be an old, limp cock,
tottering his way to the grave

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
but there is a warrior
in your pappy yet.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.490
A warrior that needs pacifying.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.490
Important, therefore, and I'm sure
you understand, that it is me

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
that finds him first, not the blues.

21:18.500 --> 21:22.490
And why's that, Mikey? So you may
put a bullet in his skull?

21:22.500 --> 21:25.490
Don't be forgetting which
body of men it was that

21:25.500 --> 21:27.490
paid your orphan way in this life.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.490
Your mammy dead and gone,

21:28.500 --> 21:31.490
the Brotherhood was more of
a father to you than he ever was.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.490
This the way you London boys
hope to charm a lady, is it?

21:34.500 --> 21:37.490
Bring your boys to stand
in threat then bully her?

21:37.500 --> 21:40.500
Did I ask for your help,
country boy? No. I did not.

21:42.500 --> 21:46.490
So, Lemonade, away with you. Go on.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.500
That's right, muck-savage.
Back on the boat.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.490
Now remember my words. Aiden Galvin.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.500
He comes skulking about,
I'm the first to know.

22:06.500 --> 22:09.490
Girl's mother, Bethan Foley -
kept IRB men safe

22:09.500 --> 22:10.490
and secret off the streets.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.490
Till she passed late
'67 in a house fire...

22:12.500 --> 22:14.490
Evening, gentlemen.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.490
Imagine, Inspector, the dance I had
to perform when it emerged that

22:18.500 --> 22:22.490
Whitechapel H Division had requested
the personal and professional

22:22.500 --> 22:28.490
particulars of so recently deceased
a dignitary as Cecil Knightly.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.490
I do imagine it now
and I am grateful.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.490
And so you should be, Inspector.

22:32.500 --> 22:37.490
The bloated fat-head sat
on Commissions - chaired them also.

22:37.500 --> 22:40.490
Parliamentary delegation
to decide which

22:40.500 --> 22:44.490
and who might be offered government
contracts for public work.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.490
The power to make men rich.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.490
Or otherwise.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.490
Flight!

22:49.500 --> 22:53.490
Chief Inspector.
You are a poor, lost immigrant

22:53.500 --> 22:56.490
searching for a home
amongst your own.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.490
What do you do straying off
the streets to fraternize with

22:59.500 --> 23:02.500
the Metropolitan Police?

23:04.500 --> 23:07.490
I made approach,
sir, but was rebuffed.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.500
I...I thought
it judicious to retreat.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.500
And you said you had
the chops for it, son.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.490
Gentlemen.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.490
You get back on her, Flight.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.490
Here.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.490
This commission of Knightly's

23:26.500 --> 23:29.490
lobbies to have the Basin Slum
at Shadwell torn down.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.490
Central and South-East Electricity
Commission wish the Basin to

23:32.500 --> 23:37.490
be emptied and re-purposed for
a new power-station and has invited

23:37.500 --> 23:40.490
bids to be tendered for how that
power station might be constructed.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.490
While the London County Council
would prefer for more

23:42.500 --> 23:44.490
sanitary dwellings to be built.

23:44.500 --> 23:47.490
Well, at least now you've got a
fresh excuse to row yourself past

23:47.500 --> 23:49.500
Councillor Cobden's door, Inspector.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.500
You, son. Sit down.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.500
No, thank you.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.490
You know, Constable, I hate to
chop your onions here...

24:09.500 --> 24:11.490
The very thought of it(!)

24:11.500 --> 24:12.490
..but you keep resisting drink,

24:12.500 --> 24:15.490
most men on this planet are going
to have a hard time trusting you.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.490
Never mind a piss-crew
of Irish exiles.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.490
You are to gain the trust of
a girl who has known little else

24:20.500 --> 24:21.490
but the inside of a tap room.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.490
And then, of course, there is
the matter of how best to penetrate

24:24.500 --> 24:26.490
that frosty exterior
and melt the fruitful vine within.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.490
I wish it were not so but there
is little Captain Jackson has

24:29.500 --> 24:31.490
left unlearnt in this subject.

24:31.500 --> 24:36.490
Now, she's pretty.

24:36.500 --> 24:37.490
Correct?

24:37.500 --> 24:39.490
She is. Hmm.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.490
Then she builds both crenulations
and portcullis about herself.

24:42.500 --> 24:46.490
No sorcery known will
allow a man ingress

24:46.500 --> 24:49.490
until she first lowers
that drawbridge down.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.490
You need to make her start
wondering after you.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.490
Feel the twinge of intrigue.

24:54.500 --> 25:00.490
Fellow feelings of vulnerability.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
Here. You see?

25:02.500 --> 25:07.490
Mother - cruelly killed
when she was but a child.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.490
Father in lock-down
and a stranger to her.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.490
You need to make yourself
the same, Flight.

25:10.500 --> 25:16.490
You need to build yourself a story -
tragic loss, destitution.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.490
It's got to be perfect, it's got to
be detailed and most important,

25:19.500 --> 25:22.490
it has got to be felt.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.490
Right here.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.490
In your heart.
With your own secrets.

25:26.500 --> 25:31.490
When you lie, you lie
with your own hidden truth.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.490
We do not have all year, however.

25:34.500 --> 25:38.490
The woman still needs
to somehow, notice him.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.490
Then we mark him out.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.490
Well, what kind of man would
this woman most likely pity?

25:43.500 --> 25:45.490
A victim of police brutality,
perhaps.

25:45.500 --> 25:50.490
Hmm. Well, I guess we'd have to
find ourselves a brutal policeman.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.500
Drake, any spring to mind?

25:58.500 --> 26:02.500
Now, put your hat down, Constable,
come on. Let's have you up.

26:05.500 --> 26:08.500
Now this is with contrition,
you understand.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.500
Look at you, Flight,
you're irresistible.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.490
Good morning, Lemonade.

26:29.500 --> 26:33.490
I'd take whiskey from you right now,
Miss, were you offering.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.490
Seems I need to find
a new name for you.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.490
You may have my real one.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.500
I am Bertrand Doyle.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.490
Then in you come, Bertrand.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.490
I'm Evelyn.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.500
Three of them, in uniform.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.490
Accused me of vagrancy and did not
care to wait for my defence.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.500
You were their sport, nothing more.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.490
What brings you here, Bertrand?

27:03.500 --> 27:06.490
The prospect of nowhere to sleep
but the cobbles of Whitechapel?

27:06.500 --> 27:09.500
Work brings me, Miss.
The hope of it, at least.

27:11.500 --> 27:13.500
Money. Food in my belly.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.500
And that's an improvement
on home, is it?

27:20.500 --> 27:24.500
No home. Never was.
Not much of, leastwise.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.500
My mother, taken by typhus
when I was five.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.490
My father, taken by drink
soon after.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.500
I've no knowledge of him.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.500
And that is why the lemonade.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.490
You've no need.

27:44.500 --> 27:45.500
Not to impress me.

27:53.500 --> 27:54.500
Come.

28:11.500 --> 28:14.490
Wash your face.
Take those boots off and rest.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.500
I'll bring food for you.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.490
MAN: Evelyn! Get yourself down here.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.490
Do you think these pints
pull themselves?

28:23.500 --> 28:24.500
Thank you, Evelyn.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.500
Rest, Bertrand.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.490
I'm sorry. They're so beautiful.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.490
One arrived for me
each year on my birthday.

29:38.500 --> 29:42.490
They came to me inside a letter from
a man who claimed he was my father.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.500
Was he that?

29:44.500 --> 29:46.490
If he is, then it seems
I have two of them.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.500
Then where is the other?

29:49.500 --> 29:52.500
Oh, I have not seen so much of him.
Not until recently, at least.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.490
He is from home? From Ireland?

29:55.500 --> 30:00.500
He's been in London all my life.
But...out of reach.

30:01.500 --> 30:05.490
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be so obscure.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.490
I feel without care in this life
and yet am made claim on by two men

30:08.500 --> 30:10.490
who are entire strangers to me.

30:10.500 --> 30:14.490
Even were my mother still here, she
might find it hard to offer clarity.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.490
From what folks here have said,
she was not exactly...

30:16.500 --> 30:18.500
exclusive in these matters.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.490
If I had had a brother, or
a father for that matter, I imagine

30:40.500 --> 30:41.500
I might have done this for him.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.500
Woke him with milk
and bread and butter.

30:47.500 --> 30:52.490
The idea, the way other
folk say it is, I mean...

30:52.500 --> 30:55.490
it's our family instruct us,
is it not?

30:55.500 --> 30:57.500
Tell us who we are,
how we should be.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.500
And...

31:11.500 --> 31:15.500
..without that instruction it's
hard, sometimes, I find, to...

31:18.500 --> 31:22.490
..to make sense of ourselves -
what we want.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.500
What is right, even.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.500
You...

31:32.500 --> 31:34.500
You scare me.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.490
Inspector, what a lovely surprise.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.490
Miss Cobden, a moment of your time.

32:00.500 --> 32:04.490
Of course, sir. Would you like
to follow me? Thank you.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.490
St Paul's Wharfside -

32:06.500 --> 32:09.490
or what the people who must
live in that slum call the Basin -

32:09.500 --> 32:12.490
is felt to be dead land,
without purpose.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.490
I would build new homes there.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.490
For the men of the Central and
South East Electricity Commission,

32:17.500 --> 32:21.490
however, there is opportunity there
for industrial development.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.490
It offers a convenient location.

32:23.500 --> 32:26.490
Coal can be delivered from
Northumberland, South Wales,

32:26.500 --> 32:28.490
and used to fire
the power station they propose.

32:28.500 --> 32:32.490
And the now-atomized Mr Knightly
sat to decide on which party

32:32.500 --> 32:35.490
would be awarded
the privilege of constructing it,

32:35.500 --> 32:38.490
giving a motive to murder him
to any electricity supplier who felt

32:38.500 --> 32:42.490
that Knightly would not
support their bid. Indeed.

32:42.500 --> 32:46.490
It just so happens there will be
a practical demonstration

32:46.500 --> 32:49.490
this afternoon by one
Charles Broadwick,

32:49.500 --> 32:53.490
who hopes to present his
suitability for such privilege.

32:53.500 --> 32:57.490
Broadwick is one of
the many tenders to build it.

32:57.500 --> 33:01.490
The theatre is on your beat,
is it not?

33:01.500 --> 33:07.490
The light above your door,
the fire in your stove,

33:07.500 --> 33:10.490
the miniature steam-train on
your boy's bedroom floor -

33:10.500 --> 33:13.490
all will be brought into
energetic purpose

33:13.500 --> 33:17.490
by your very own supply
of electric current,

33:17.500 --> 33:21.490
arriving beneath the paving
stones of your street

33:21.500 --> 33:23.500
and into the life of your home.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.490
None of this is in question.

33:27.500 --> 33:32.490
But yet...there is
one debate left for us.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.490
A debate which must be decided
before this future finds you.

33:35.500 --> 33:39.490
Where will this power
be brought into being?

33:39.500 --> 33:42.490
How will it be delivered
to your hearthside?

33:42.500 --> 33:45.490
Because for all its wonder,

33:45.500 --> 33:49.500
the electrical age is also one
of profound danger, my friends.

33:50.500 --> 33:55.490
The choice we all face
is between currents.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.490
Alternating current
or direct current.

33:59.500 --> 34:03.490
Both cages are set for identical
voltage but differing currents.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.500
The contrast between
the two is alarming.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.489
If you please?

34:09.500 --> 34:10.500
WHIRRING

34:11.500 --> 34:13.500
HUMMING AND CRACKLING

34:16.500 --> 34:18.489
BLEATING

34:18.500 --> 34:21.500
HE GASPS
Behold!

34:25.500 --> 34:27.500
CRACKLING

34:38.500 --> 34:40.500
Behold, alternating current.

34:42.500 --> 34:46.500
I send you away now, ladies and
gentlemen, to ponder only this...

34:47.500 --> 34:51.500
Which of these currents
would you allow into your home?

34:52.500 --> 34:56.489
There can be only one choice.
And that is direct.

34:56.500 --> 35:00.490
Direct current for London,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.500
APPLAUSE

35:16.500 --> 35:20.490
Good evening. Charles Broadwick
of Broadwick Machine Works.

35:20.500 --> 35:23.490
If you have further questions,
I'm only too happy to oblige.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.490
Reid. Police. Councillor Cobden.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.490
Ah, I am delighted.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.490
A member of our august
and newly minted County Council.

35:32.500 --> 35:36.490
And a man whose mind is designed
to see truth wherever it is hid.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.490
And what truth would you have me
describe here, Mr Broadwick?

35:39.500 --> 35:42.490
That animals and electricity
do not make great bedfellows?

35:42.500 --> 35:45.490
You are not convinced by
my demonstration, Mr Reid?

35:45.500 --> 35:47.490
I have asked myself
if that cage was even charged.

35:47.500 --> 35:48.490
Oh, come, sir! Of course it is not!

35:48.500 --> 35:51.490
These animals, whilst never dear,
still cost.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.500
And all men of science
must economise.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.490
Mr Knightly.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.490
The man who was murdered this night
last - I assume you knew of him.

36:00.500 --> 36:03.490
Knew him in life,
mourn him in death.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.500
And currently await news
of who next I must bribe.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.490
Parliament passed a law last year,
Mr Broadwick. An anti-bribery law.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.490
Perhaps you'd care to
correct your last statement?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.490
Oh, come, Mr Reid.
This is priceless.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.490
You are welcome to arrest me.

36:17.500 --> 36:21.490
But should you do so you will be
forced to do likewise to all men

36:21.500 --> 36:23.490
who ever bid for
governmental contract!

36:23.500 --> 36:26.490
Every commercial body wishing
to turn St Paul's Wharfside

36:26.500 --> 36:28.490
into a generating plant
was paying Knightly.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.490
The only secret you
will discover from me, sir,

36:31.500 --> 36:34.490
is whether I was paying
above or below his median rate!

36:34.500 --> 36:38.490
In fact, we should ask Mr Ferranti!

36:38.500 --> 36:39.490
Miss Cobden, you will,

36:39.500 --> 36:42.490
I am sure, be attending
his exposition this evening.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.490
Indeed. It is the invitation
of the season.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.490
But Mr Ferranti's power station
at Deptford is already

36:47.500 --> 36:50.490
constructed on the principle
of alternating current.

36:50.500 --> 36:54.490
We must admire our rivals, Mr Reid,
if we wish to be worthy of them.

36:54.500 --> 36:57.490
Of all the men who waited on
Mr Knightly's influence, it is

36:57.500 --> 36:59.490
perhaps Mr Ferranti
who placed the most at stake.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.490
He would add to the power station

37:01.500 --> 37:04.490
he has already constructed
at Deptford and,

37:04.500 --> 37:06.490
with his new design at St Paul's,
make it is his exclusive purpose

37:06.500 --> 37:09.490
to power all of central London
from within his halls.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.490
But there is talk of trouble,
of concerns over its scale

37:12.500 --> 37:14.500
and the scale of danger
it represents.

37:22.500 --> 37:23.500
Mr Ferranti.

37:25.500 --> 37:26.490
Yes?

37:26.500 --> 37:28.490
Inspector Reid. Police.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.490
How can I help you, sir?

37:30.500 --> 37:32.490
You find us preparing
this evening's exposition.

37:32.500 --> 37:37.490
Yes, for men and women of influence.
Influenced.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.490
You are cynical, Inspector?

37:39.500 --> 37:40.490
No, not of the science,

37:40.500 --> 37:44.490
but the means by which
you purchase favour.

37:44.500 --> 37:47.490
So I must ask you
whether or not you bribed Knightly

37:47.500 --> 37:50.490
to support your bid
for St Paul's Wharfside.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.490
Yes, we gave the man money.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.500
But so we might not be ignored.

37:55.500 --> 37:59.490
The field of play thus levelled,
we were to win, Mr Reid.

37:59.500 --> 38:00.490
We are, yet.

38:00.500 --> 38:03.490
My competitors cast spells
of death and destruction

38:03.500 --> 38:08.490
as if they think the people of
this city are Neanderthals to be
terrified at the sight of fire.

38:08.500 --> 38:11.490
I have no need of such strategy.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.490
Electrical current is
a fierce and unruly force.

38:13.500 --> 38:17.490
What alternating power promises
is the means by which such

38:17.500 --> 38:20.490
ferocity is made benign.

38:20.500 --> 38:24.490
You drop the voltage
using your transformer,

38:24.500 --> 38:26.490
then you hive it off
for domestic consumption.

38:26.500 --> 38:31.490
Indeed. I have removed
the beast from the machine.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.490
Oh, I know what you wonder -
whether I might have motive to do

38:34.500 --> 38:37.490
worse to a man like Knightly
than meet his demands of bribery.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.490
But I have no need to
resort to murder

38:39.500 --> 38:42.500
when I have the perfect logic
of science at my side.

38:43.500 --> 38:47.490
Does he strike you
as the breed of man
to consort with escaped dynamiters?

38:47.500 --> 38:49.490
Not so much, sir. No.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.490
And yet Galvin is connected
to this circuit somewhere.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.500
And his beast remains intact.

39:01.500 --> 39:04.490
DOOR OPENS

39:04.500 --> 39:07.490
You touch him and
I'm straight to the blues.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.500
Do you understand me?

39:11.500 --> 39:13.490
What's your name, boy?

39:13.500 --> 39:15.490
What's yours, sir?

39:15.500 --> 39:18.490
He is Bertrand.
And this, Bertrand, is Aiden,

39:18.500 --> 39:21.490
who somehow now believes
he has a right to be my protector.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.500
You do not.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.500
And do I deserve the right to
a word with you in private?

39:30.500 --> 39:32.490
Please, darling.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.490
I leave this city tonight.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.500
One way or another.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.500
Will you give us a moment, Bertrand?

39:56.500 --> 40:00.490
The MP exploded in his rooms.
That was you.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.500
Don't tell me you weep
for him, Evelyn.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.490
I care not a thing for him.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.490
But somehow, fool that I am,
I care for you.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.490
Know you will now be pursued

40:11.500 --> 40:14.490
and hanged right here in this city
that you hate so bitterly.

40:14.500 --> 40:16.490
I do dream that, Evie.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.490
But I have one last task
I must perform.

40:18.500 --> 40:22.490
And then... Look, my love.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.500
New York.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.490
One for you.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.500
And, with this task achieved,
one for me.

40:31.500 --> 40:36.490
and with enough folding
to see us righter than a dosshouse
in the Five Points.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.490
Now, I know this is strange
for you, Evelyn.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.490
I am unknown to you.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.490
And yet, this -

40:43.500 --> 40:47.490
to provide this for you -
is like a dream for me.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.490
You don't have to befriend me, girl,

40:49.500 --> 40:52.500
nor call me Father,
nor even look at me when we sail.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
But you'll take this chance.

40:57.500 --> 40:58.500
Take it.

41:11.500 --> 41:12.490
Aiden.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.500
Darling.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.490
This task that you go to?

41:17.500 --> 41:20.490
Not for you to worry over, darling.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.500
I'll see you here later, all right?

41:24.500 --> 41:25.500
Wait.

41:27.500 --> 41:28.500
Do you know a man called Holland?

41:30.500 --> 41:31.500
Do you?

41:32.500 --> 41:34.490
He writes to me.

41:34.500 --> 41:37.500
And these letters -
what do they say?

41:39.500 --> 41:41.500
Well, he sends one every birthday.

41:43.500 --> 41:46.490
He says that he's my father.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.500
Oh, does he now?

42:38.500 --> 42:41.490
You take this to Inspector Reid
of Leman Street.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.490
I am Flight.

42:43.500 --> 42:44.500
You do it now.

42:49.500 --> 42:53.500
Sergeant! Message for
Inspector Reid. Urgent!

42:55.500 --> 42:59.490
He found letters, he says.
Important to the girl. From America.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.490
A man laying claim to her parentage.

43:01.500 --> 43:03.490
But Galvin is her father, is he not?

43:03.500 --> 43:05.490
And he was reclined
in a cell at Newgate.

43:05.500 --> 43:09.490
This man's name, Holland, however.
Letters to the girl since 1868.

43:09.500 --> 43:10.490
The year after her mother's death.

43:10.500 --> 43:12.490
And Galvin went down.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.490
All right, so he's made note
of the different postmarks,

43:14.500 --> 43:16.490
different towns
and states till 1881,

43:16.500 --> 43:19.490
then his travels cease. Cease there.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.500
Raritan, New Jersey.

43:22.500 --> 43:23.490
Raritan?

43:23.500 --> 43:24.490
Letter after letter to the girl,

43:24.500 --> 43:28.490
so we must assume this man Holland
settles there.

43:28.500 --> 43:30.490
Menlo Park is in Raritan,
is it not, Captain?

43:30.500 --> 43:34.490
It is, Reid,
and thus the circuit's made.

43:34.500 --> 43:37.490
Menlo Park is an industrial park
created by one Thomas Edison.

43:37.500 --> 43:40.490
The inventor?
Also a man of business.

43:40.500 --> 43:42.490
More patents filed in more fields
of inquiry than any man alive.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.490
And yet his one ardent pursuit -

43:44.500 --> 43:47.490
to secure the means by which the
United States of America distributes

43:47.500 --> 43:51.490
its electricity and to secure it for
his own chosen charge and current.

43:51.500 --> 43:53.490
He is for direct current.

43:53.500 --> 43:56.490
Unlike Ferranti,
who is for alternating, is he not?

43:56.500 --> 44:01.490
But akin to another man I have met
recently, Dr Charles Broadwick.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.490
Captain, you would trust Edison

44:03.500 --> 44:05.490
to own a telegraph machine,
would you not?

44:05.500 --> 44:07.500
The leanest and fastest, Reid.

44:30.500 --> 44:33.490
Edison did indeed employ
James Percival Holland -

44:33.500 --> 44:36.490
English physicist. Alma mater -
University College London.

44:36.500 --> 44:39.490
And wanted by us
as a known IRB collaborator

44:39.500 --> 44:41.490
in the Clerkenwell bombing.

44:41.500 --> 44:43.490
The same circle as Aiden Galvin.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.490
Wanted but never brought to ground.
He got on a boat, then.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.490
Made his way
and his life in America.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.490
Receives employment at Menlo Park,

44:48.500 --> 44:51.490
education at the feet
of Thomas Edison.

44:51.500 --> 44:56.490
The letters to the girl -
they ceased in 1887, did they not?

44:56.500 --> 44:57.490
Indeed.

44:57.500 --> 45:00.490
Because I am beginning to wonder if,
in fact, this man Holland left

45:00.500 --> 45:02.490
America when those letters stopped
and travelled here to London,

45:02.500 --> 45:04.500
travelling beneath a different name.

45:08.500 --> 45:12.500
Broadwick Machine Works.
Instituted September 10th 1887.

45:14.500 --> 45:18.490
Charles Broadwick, like Holland,
a champion of direct current.

45:18.500 --> 45:21.490
Charles Broadwick was once
James Holland, he who sprung

45:21.500 --> 45:24.500
Aiden Galvin from his prison wagon
and set him to kill Knightly.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.490
And just what business
of yours is she,

45:28.500 --> 45:31.490
to be writing to her
all the way from America?

45:31.500 --> 45:35.490
I knew her too, Aiden.
Remember the girl fondly.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.490
Why should I not ask after her?

45:37.500 --> 45:40.490
Because she is not yours
to ask after!

45:40.500 --> 45:42.500
Did you write from your cell?

45:43.500 --> 45:46.490
I did not. Then is it not better
that one of us did?

45:46.500 --> 45:50.490
One of us? Do not
make me the same as you.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.490
One of us(!)

45:51.500 --> 45:54.500
Dynamite. That's all we ever shared.

45:55.500 --> 45:57.490
Dynamite...

45:57.500 --> 45:59.500
and a woman.

46:01.500 --> 46:03.490
Bethan Foley was mine!

46:03.500 --> 46:06.490
She was not, Aiden.
Not alone. Do you forget?

46:06.500 --> 46:08.500
She was never particular.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.490
And Evelyn?

46:11.500 --> 46:12.490
Tell me, you bastard.

46:12.500 --> 46:17.490
You'd been jailed. I was bound
for New York. Bethan found me.

46:17.500 --> 46:19.490
Told me that I am Evelyn's father.

46:19.500 --> 46:22.500
Asked if I might
make myself known to the girl.

46:24.500 --> 46:28.490
But I could not - would not.

46:28.500 --> 46:31.490
I may send her presents but I do not
have the strength to be a father.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.490
And is that why you broke me out?

46:33.500 --> 46:36.490
So that I might finally
have the truth from you?

46:36.500 --> 46:39.490
I released you so that
you might know freedom

46:39.500 --> 46:41.490
and vent your rage against
this country once more.

46:41.500 --> 46:46.490
Don't come the charitable English
rebel with me, Jamie.

46:46.500 --> 46:51.490
It is a venting designed to
suit your purpose and ambition.

46:51.500 --> 46:54.490
This task you would set
me on is not for ideas

46:54.500 --> 46:57.490
but for your own advancement
and profit.

46:57.500 --> 46:59.490
Perhaps.

46:59.500 --> 47:01.490
But you're well paid for it, Aiden.

47:01.500 --> 47:04.490
And it is that profit which
will see you to New York.

47:04.500 --> 47:08.490
Before then, however, half of
the London County Council waits

47:08.500 --> 47:10.500
on Sebastian Ferranti's word.

47:12.500 --> 47:14.500
And on your dynamite.

47:16.500 --> 47:19.490
Your last chance to spill the blood
of British politicians.

47:19.500 --> 47:23.490
And mine, to extinguish
my competitors.

47:23.500 --> 47:26.500
The Aiden Galvin I remember
would never have declined
such an opportunity.

47:29.500 --> 47:30.500
Eirinn go Brach?

47:32.500 --> 47:34.500
Eirinn go Brach.

47:38.500 --> 47:39.500
DOOR CLOSES

48:02.500 --> 48:03.490
Flight?

48:03.500 --> 48:05.490
Sir, you need to see this.

48:05.500 --> 48:08.490
The device described here -
Galvin has it.

48:08.500 --> 48:11.490
Another electric circuit
to detonate the explosive.

48:11.500 --> 48:15.490
But this - what is this within?
A wax stem?

48:15.500 --> 48:18.490
That's a delay.
It allows him to get clear.

48:18.500 --> 48:21.490
See, the wax plug keeps
the electric contact plates apart.

48:21.500 --> 48:24.490
No circuit's made,
therefore the device is harmless

48:24.500 --> 48:26.490
unless you put it beside
a heat source.

48:26.500 --> 48:28.490
Or...

48:28.500 --> 48:30.490
inside one.

48:30.500 --> 48:32.490
Ferranti's transformer.

48:32.500 --> 48:35.500
The transformer melts the wax,
allowing the plates into congress.

48:37.500 --> 48:38.500
Boom.

48:49.500 --> 48:51.490
Councillor. Hello.

48:51.500 --> 48:53.490
How wonderful to see you.
Oh, my pleasure.

48:53.500 --> 48:56.490
I'm thrilled you could join us.
I'm looking forward to it.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.500
Wonderful. We have
a fine show in store. Thank you.

49:03.500 --> 49:04.500
Good evening.

49:09.500 --> 49:11.500
Good evening, Miss Cobden.
Mr Broadwick.

49:30.500 --> 49:31.490
Ladies and gentlemen.

49:31.500 --> 49:34.490
I could, of course,
wish you welcome to the future

49:34.500 --> 49:37.490
but, whilst this most certainly
is the future I am to show you,

49:37.500 --> 49:40.490
I would not do so with fireworks.

49:40.500 --> 49:44.500
Although such things are certainly
within my gift. I will show you.

49:46.500 --> 49:50.490
Here, piped from our power station
at Deptford, I may deliver

49:50.500 --> 49:53.500
almost 800 kilowatts
of generated power.

49:55.500 --> 49:57.500
CRACKLING

49:59.500 --> 50:03.490
Enough not only to kill whichever
dumb animal my competitors

50:03.500 --> 50:06.490
would use as
slanderous scaremongery,

50:06.500 --> 50:10.490
but to stop a stampeding herd
of bison, if need be.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.500
But no.

50:12.500 --> 50:17.490
I do not hope to impress you
with such power,

50:17.500 --> 50:21.490
but rather with the means by
which such power is mastered -

50:21.500 --> 50:24.500
transformed by
alternating current...

50:25.500 --> 50:28.500
..and put to whichever
peaceful purpose we choose.

50:32.500 --> 50:35.500
I will bring light to your
streets and peace to your homes.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.500
The city illuminated,
ladies and gentlemen.

50:45.500 --> 50:46.500
Bravo!

51:03.500 --> 51:05.490
Ferranti! Shut it down now!

51:05.500 --> 51:08.490
Mr Reid, explain yourself!
Shut it down. Do it now, sir!

51:08.500 --> 51:12.500
Everybody out, now!
Get up and get out, nice and calmly.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.490
This must be dismantled. Why?

51:16.500 --> 51:19.500
Because we believe it
may have been sabotaged.

51:23.500 --> 51:27.490
It should have blown by now.
You go back in there and you fix it!

51:27.500 --> 51:30.490
No. I am no longer
your dynamite delivery boy.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.490
You do it yourself, Jamie.

51:32.500 --> 51:35.490
I go now to let Evelyn know
the truth of who she is.

51:35.500 --> 51:38.490
She might be your flesh and blood
but she's my girl

51:38.500 --> 51:41.490
and I will see her right
in this world.

51:41.500 --> 51:42.500
Eirinn go Brach, Jamie.

51:52.500 --> 51:55.490
Everyone out now! Come on.

51:55.500 --> 51:58.490
Let's get up and get out of here.

51:58.500 --> 52:01.500
Come on, ladies and gentlemen,
move along. Keep moving.

52:06.500 --> 52:09.500
You looking for this, brother?
James Holland.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.490
Good evening. Inspector Reid.

52:12.500 --> 52:17.490
You are under arrest. Murder and
attempted murder. Multiple counts.

52:17.500 --> 52:19.490
You are for the rope, sir.

52:19.500 --> 52:21.490
Infernal machines.

52:21.500 --> 52:23.500
No! No! Don't touch him, sir!

52:35.500 --> 52:36.500
LOW CHATTER

52:42.500 --> 52:45.500
God bless you. Safe journey.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.500
Take care. Take care of yourself.

52:53.500 --> 52:57.490
I thought my father
had scared you off for good.

52:57.500 --> 52:59.500
Perhaps he did.

53:00.500 --> 53:02.490
Still, my courage is found now.

53:02.500 --> 53:06.500
Should I prepare myself
to fight him? Perhaps.

53:08.500 --> 53:10.500
You leave with him, I think.

53:11.500 --> 53:12.500
I do, Bertrand.

53:15.500 --> 53:16.500
America.

53:18.500 --> 53:20.500
I understand, Evelyn.

53:25.500 --> 53:27.490
May I wait with you?

53:27.500 --> 53:28.500
Perhaps shake his hand?

53:52.500 --> 53:54.500
Think you're leaving, do you, Aiden?

53:57.500 --> 53:59.490
And you are?

53:59.500 --> 54:02.490
I am your centre. Your colonel.

54:02.500 --> 54:05.500
Colonel? You're milk piss, boy.

54:11.500 --> 54:12.500
There will be peace.

54:15.500 --> 54:17.500
There'll never be peace.

54:20.500 --> 54:21.500
THUD

54:26.500 --> 54:28.490
Does he not come?

54:28.500 --> 54:29.500
Well, he was never reliable.

54:33.500 --> 54:35.490
Perhaps you should sail with me.

54:35.500 --> 54:37.500
Ah, send me an address
and I'll come find you.

54:44.500 --> 54:46.500
But who should I send it to,
Bertrand?

54:49.500 --> 54:51.500
Whoever you are,
that is not your real name.

54:56.500 --> 54:57.500
Who are you?

55:00.500 --> 55:01.500
Go. Take your boat, Evelyn.

55:07.500 --> 55:08.500
And did you lose your mother?

55:10.500 --> 55:11.500
And your father too?

55:14.500 --> 55:15.500
Those things are true.

55:17.500 --> 55:19.500
And the rest?

55:23.500 --> 55:24.500
Take your boat.

55:47.500 --> 55:50.490
HE SHIVERS

55:50.500 --> 55:51.500
HE SNIFFS

56:01.500 --> 56:03.490
One might say you saved
my life, Inspector.

56:03.500 --> 56:07.500
That being the case, I have put
my mind to how I might thank you.

56:08.500 --> 56:12.490
I thought I might allow you to
walk with me this Sunday afternoon.

56:12.500 --> 56:16.500
At Hampstead, perhaps. We could
take a blanket and some cold wine.

56:17.500 --> 56:20.490
Miss Cobden... When will you
call me Jane, Inspector?

56:20.500 --> 56:23.500
Miss Cobden, I...

56:25.500 --> 56:28.500
I do not know what you think it is
has passed between us.

56:31.500 --> 56:33.490
I am married.

56:33.500 --> 56:34.500
Mr Reid.

56:36.500 --> 56:37.500
Edmund.

56:38.500 --> 56:42.490
I am, as you know, for the present
and the future, but never the past.

56:42.500 --> 56:45.500
There is nothing
but black magnetism there.

56:46.500 --> 56:50.500
Allow me and I will
help you to resist it.

56:54.500 --> 56:55.500
I am sorry, Miss Cobden.

57:25.500 --> 57:27.490
You run them - confess it.

57:27.500 --> 57:28.490
No, sir! Yes, sir!

57:28.500 --> 57:30.490
You pander and pimp those boys

57:30.500 --> 57:31.490
who ought to be safe in your care.

57:31.500 --> 57:33.490
I want you.

57:33.500 --> 57:34.490
Tell me we can do this.

57:34.500 --> 57:38.490
We can do this.
He'll pay. He has to.

57:38.500 --> 57:40.490
These are mine. Silver and copper.

57:40.500 --> 57:41.490
Within a week - 200.

57:41.500 --> 57:43.490
And the value just soars.

57:43.500 --> 57:45.490
How would you like the Star

57:45.500 --> 57:47.490
to turn the biggest bank
in London upside down?

57:47.500 --> 57:50.490
I acted in the best interests
of my bank and its investors.

57:50.500 --> 57:52.490
By lying to them.

57:52.500 --> 57:54.500
What is the purpose of our work?
