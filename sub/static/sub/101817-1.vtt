M_I_SForEver

00:46.428 --> 00:48.431
This is my family.

00:48.464 --> 00:52.469
This is my dad, Rob.
He's a cop. He s also a jerk.

00:53.702 --> 00:58.141
This is mum, Marina. She s a
nurse, but dad says it doesn't

00:58.174 --> 01:00.476
count because
she's not a doctor.

01:00.509 --> 01:05.447
That s me. Francine, Frankie,
Fran, Frangipani and...

01:05.480 --> 01:09.518
And that's Teddy.
Oh yeah, he's a zombie.

01:12.488 --> 01:14.390
It all started one day last year

01:14.423 --> 01:16.292
when Teddy
came home a little sick.

01:16.325 --> 01:19.896
I don t know how or where he got
it from, but within three days

01:19.929 --> 01:22.364
he was a full on zombie.

01:22.397 --> 01:24.634
It s not that hard you know.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.403
I go to school, Ma and
Pa go to work and Teddy

01:27.435 --> 01:29.238
gets locked up in the chamber.

01:29.271 --> 01:31.274
It s pretty sweet if you ask me.

01:39.414 --> 01:40.916
Pass the salt?

01:40.950 --> 01:42.652
Hmm?

01:42.685 --> 01:44.687
What did you say?

01:45.554 --> 01:47.256
I said salt, Frank.

01:47.289 --> 01:50.960
Geez Rob, say please. Even the
mute kids in hospital say it.

01:50.992 --> 01:52.428
What do you mean?
They can't say it.

01:52.461 --> 01:54.497
They can say it.

01:54.530 --> 01:57.967
They don't necessarily say-say
it, but they can do this.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.203
Come
on Teddy, show Pa with me.

02:11.512 --> 02:13.783
Good boy!

02:19.287 --> 02:21.290
Want some salt, Teddy?

02:23.791 --> 02:26.396
You're so cute. You trying to
scare me like that? Bop.

02:28.564 --> 02:30.533
That's my boy.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.501
How was school today Fran?

02:33.535 --> 02:34.670
Yeah, good.

02:34.702 --> 02:37.372
There's this dance coming
up that will be pretty cool.

02:37.405 --> 02:39.509
Pretty lame.

02:41.277 --> 02:45.315
Yeah... pretty lame, I guess.
That's all really.

02:47.016 --> 02:49.318
How was your day Teddy?

02:49.350 --> 02:50.385
Rargh.

02:50.418 --> 02:52.688
Rargh. So pretty chilled, hey?

02:52.720 --> 02:56.524
Well, today,
I arrested two guys for B & E.

02:56.558 --> 02:57.760
Cool.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.428
Don't talk with your mouth full.
It's disgusting.

03:03.499 --> 03:06.001
You're so funny, Teddy.

03:06.035 --> 03:08.004
You're so impressive, baby.

03:08.036 --> 03:09.004
No you are.

03:09.037 --> 03:10.005
You are.

03:10.039 --> 03:11.006
No, you are.

03:11.040 --> 03:14.244
You are. You are.

03:19.814 --> 03:22.684
Teddy? You ever think Dad
doesn t like you?

03:22.718 --> 03:24.487
Rargh.

03:24.519 --> 03:26.789
Yeah, stupid idea. You're right.

03:27.356 --> 03:31.494
Teddy, I really miss hanging out
with you at school, but there's

03:31.527 --> 03:34.797
this new girl - her name is
Calissa. She's so cool.

03:34.830 --> 03:39.035
She s got nice hair, those
dimpley-things and I think she

03:39.068 --> 03:41.837
must play netball.
She's awesome bro.

03:41.869 --> 03:45.408
Anyway I was thinking of asking
her to be my best friend.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.542
What
do you think?

03:47.576 --> 03:49.612
Rargh.

03:49.644 --> 03:52.047
Nah. I can t ask Dad about it.

03:52.081 --> 03:54.083
He wouldn't know
how to make friends.

03:54.116 --> 03:55.718
Rargh.

03:55.750 --> 03:59.554
I thought so.
I ll let you know how it goes.

04:15.604 --> 04:17.072
Man you have to practice.

04:17.105 --> 04:19.408
You used to be so
good at doing that.

04:32.121 --> 04:34.424
I love you, bro.

05:13.662 --> 05:16.132
Hey, Teddy, have you seen my
school shirt?

05:16.165 --> 05:17.133
Rargh.

05:17.165 --> 05:18.533
I've got it here.

05:18.566 --> 05:20.535
What happened?

05:20.569 --> 05:23.472
Sorry honey, I put it in with
Teddy's shirts again.

05:23.504 --> 05:25.707
I forgot blood stains.

05:25.740 --> 05:26.908
Yep.

05:27.708 --> 05:31.814
Teddy stop
being such a messy eater.

05:31.847 --> 05:34.517
Can t we get him a bib or
something?

05:34.550 --> 05:35.583
No.

05:35.617 --> 05:36.619
But why?

05:36.651 --> 05:37.485
No.

05:37.518 --> 05:38.453
Why not?

05:38.487 --> 05:39.855
Because I said so.

05:39.888 --> 05:41.824
Because I said so.

05:41.857 --> 05:43.025
What did you say?

05:43.057 --> 05:45.827
Okay, go go go. Francine, get
ready. Put your shirt on.

05:45.860 --> 05:46.761
Get your bag.

05:46.795 --> 05:48.630
Rob, drink that coffee.
Get your lunchbox.

05:48.663 --> 05:52.401
And Teddy, finish that steak.

06:05.547 --> 06:06.648
I love you.

06:06.682 --> 06:07.650
I love you more.

06:07.682 --> 06:09.851
No, I love you more.

06:09.884 --> 06:12.687
I love you more than the time
you said you loved me more.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.189
That was just then.

06:14.223 --> 06:16.191
I know. Bye baby.

06:16.225 --> 06:18.461
Bye.

06:26.602 --> 06:28.604
There he goes.

06:53.795 --> 06:57.266
So Ma, there's this new girl at
school that I really like and I

06:57.299 --> 06:59.235
wanna ask her
to be my best friend.

06:59.268 --> 07:00.669
What do I do?

07:00.701 --> 07:01.937
Oh.

07:01.970 --> 07:04.707
I m not very good at that sort
of thing, Fran. You should ask

07:04.739 --> 07:06.609
your father. He's very outgoing.

07:06.641 --> 07:08.743
But I am asking you.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.880
Well then, when I was young,

07:11.913 --> 07:14.048
it was a bit
easier to make friends.

07:14.081 --> 07:16.651
Girls either liked you
or didn't like you.

07:16.684 --> 07:18.052
But now with the internet...

07:18.086 --> 07:20.823
you have to be very careful who
you hang out with Fran.

07:20.855 --> 07:22.257
If someone doesn't like you,

07:22.290 --> 07:24.927
they hate you, they can make
your life living hell.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.796
People can say anything online
and it can really take its toll

07:27.828 --> 07:31.900
on girls like you.

07:36.905 --> 07:41.010
Sorry, I'm not very helpful.

07:41.809 --> 07:45.747
Just be yourself
and she will adore you.

07:45.780 --> 07:49.617
Also on a side note, you might
want to stay undercover today.

07:49.650 --> 07:52.088
Magpies love steak juice.

07:55.023 --> 07:56.859
Good luck.

07:56.891 --> 07:59.728
Bye mum.

08:13.341 --> 08:15.910
Hey Frankenstein,
nice shirt you got on.

08:15.944 --> 08:17.646
Oh thanks.

08:17.679 --> 08:19.715
I was joking.

08:19.747 --> 08:23.319
Ooh.

08:23.352 --> 08:25.354
Bet you wish you were somewhere
else right now?

08:25.386 --> 08:28.590
Yeah, why don't you
go back to Indo-laysia?

08:28.624 --> 08:31.059
Butch, that's racist.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.059
So?

08:32.092 --> 08:33.794
That's offensive to me.

08:33.828 --> 08:35.597
Oh. Sorry Brooklyn.

08:35.631 --> 08:36.799
That's okay man.

08:36.832 --> 08:38.067
And that's not even a country.

08:38.099 --> 08:39.967
What did you say?

08:40.001 --> 08:42.871
Keep it together man.
Keep it together.

08:43.405 --> 08:45.374
Haven't got your brother here to
protect you anymore, huh?

08:45.406 --> 08:47.008
Yeah, where's
Teddy when you need him?

08:47.041 --> 08:49.011
Not here.

08:49.044 --> 08:50.913
Guess what Frankenstein?

08:50.945 --> 08:51.846
What?

08:51.880 --> 08:54.850
I don't like...

08:54.882 --> 08:56.384
You!

08:56.418 --> 08:57.852
She screams like a girl.

08:57.886 --> 09:00.856
She is one. What's your point?

09:01.555 --> 09:02.958
How about you both get lost or

09:02.991 --> 09:05.895
I ll tell Ms Green
what I just saw.

09:09.765 --> 09:12.768
They're bullies.
Don t listen to them Frankie.

09:13.934 --> 09:16.104
Hey, I like your pink shirt.

09:16.137 --> 09:17.006
Really?

09:17.039 --> 09:19.708
Yeah, pink is one of my
favorite colors.

09:19.741 --> 09:21.744
Mine too.

09:24.813 --> 09:26.949
Something smells.

09:26.982 --> 09:28.050
You stink!

09:28.083 --> 09:30.118
Oh, no, it's my shirt.
Beef juice.

09:30.151 --> 09:31.386
What?

09:31.420 --> 09:33.988
Yeah. Ma says I've got to stay
undercover, otherwise I might

09:34.021 --> 09:36.124
get attacked by magpies.

09:36.157 --> 09:40.028
Cool. You wanna try?

10:01.049 --> 10:06.054
Ugh. Ow. Ah. Ooh that tickles.
Magpies get off me.

10:09.024 --> 10:11.760
Stupid Magpies.

10:11.793 --> 10:15.731
That was awesome,
Frankie. Are you okay?

10:16.798 --> 10:18.801
Come on.

10:23.237 --> 10:28.044
Okay, so your homework for the
weekend is to write a poem on

10:28.577 --> 10:31.980
something that
you're passionate about.

10:32.012 --> 10:36.985
So that might be horses or
ponies or...

10:38.987 --> 10:42.057
The Mexican Cartels smuggling

10:42.089 --> 10:44.826
contraband across
the American border.

10:44.859 --> 10:48.196
Only to be caught and
permanently thrown in jail.

10:48.229 --> 10:52.934
Or dolphins or unicorns,

10:53.734 --> 10:58.940
or the dark history of the
Belanglo State Forest.

10:59.907 --> 11:05.113
Or whales maybe? Cows?
Cricket? Who likes cricket?

11:44.585 --> 11:47.789
How was your day?

11:49.558 --> 11:51.761
What the?

11:54.195 --> 11:55.863
You're lucky I brought a towel.

11:55.896 --> 11:58.133
We've just had
these seats cleaned.

12:14.583 --> 12:16.552
Ma have you seen my homework?

12:16.584 --> 12:18.953
I don't know honey. Ask Teddy.

12:18.987 --> 12:21.256
Teddy, have you seen my
homework?

12:21.289 --> 12:23.859
Teddy, what have you done?

12:23.891 --> 12:26.929
That was the best
homework I've ever done!

12:27.295 --> 12:29.330
Pa, Teddy ate my homework.

12:29.363 --> 12:31.934
Oh good one. Like I haven t
heard that before.

12:31.967 --> 12:33.602
Pa! Seriously, he ate it.

12:33.635 --> 12:35.571
Frank, what have
I said about lying?

12:35.603 --> 12:38.105
I'm not lying. It's a poem,
Pa, like the best one

12:38.139 --> 12:39.208
I've ever written.

12:39.241 --> 12:40.909
Oh Teddy ate your homework.

12:40.942 --> 12:42.376
Yes!

12:42.410 --> 12:45.014
Teddy!

12:45.814 --> 12:50.019
Where's your proof Shakespeare?
Chamber, now.

12:54.222 --> 12:58.227
You know the rules. This is what
happens when you lie.

13:15.075 --> 13:18.247
Why'd you do that Teddy? Now dad
thinks I'm a liar and it was

13:18.280 --> 13:21.049
seriously the best poem I had
ever written.

13:21.082 --> 13:25.386
You can't repeat that kind of
genius. It was like...

13:28.390 --> 13:32.194
Uh, I can't remember.
You ate it all.

13:35.195 --> 13:38.333
I'm sorry, Teddy. You must have
been really hungry, huh?

13:40.334 --> 13:41.936
Rargh.

13:44.305 --> 13:47.975
Oh, Calissa? Well I think we are
becoming best friends.

13:48.008 --> 13:49.243
I don't know though,

13:49.276 --> 13:53.147
the only best friend I've ever
had is you and you're family.

13:53.180 --> 13:56.651
But Teddy, I've never stared at
someone for so long before.

13:56.684 --> 13:57.886
I timed it.

13:57.920 --> 14:02.056
Forty-three seconds. Do you
think we'll be forever friends?

14:02.089 --> 14:03.658
Rargh.

14:03.692 --> 14:07.262
I think so too. I made her a
friendship bracelet just in

14:07.295 --> 14:11.199
case, I'm going to give it to
her at the dance.

14:11.232 --> 14:13.468
Rargh.

14:13.501 --> 14:17.039
I love you too, bro.

14:31.752 --> 14:32.687
Rargh.

14:32.721 --> 14:36.425
Teddy you can't do that. I'm
almost eleven.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.993
I need my privacy.

14:41.295 --> 14:43.299
Bad boy Teddy.

15:14.561 --> 15:17.098
Are you excited about the dance
tonight Fran?

15:17.131 --> 15:20.368
Yeah.
Calissa's gonna look so good

15:20.401 --> 15:21.469
Who?

15:21.502 --> 15:23.070
My girlfriend?

15:23.103 --> 15:26.208
You have a girlfriend. Marina,
did you know about this?

15:26.241 --> 15:30.245
She's a girl who's a friend.

15:30.277 --> 15:33.147
Anyway, I was hoping we could
pick her up Ma?

15:33.180 --> 15:34.348
Who?

15:34.381 --> 15:35.751
The girl.

15:35.784 --> 15:36.751
Who?

15:36.785 --> 15:38.219
My friend!

15:38.252 --> 15:40.254
Oh, I thought she might have
been imaginary.

15:40.288 --> 15:43.292
Oh Rob. Stop it.
Of course Francine.

15:45.126 --> 15:47.496
I think there's
enough room in the car.

15:47.529 --> 15:50.499
What do you mean, enough?

15:50.531 --> 15:53.035
Well...

15:53.068 --> 15:55.102
Teddy's going too.

15:55.136 --> 15:57.039
He hasn't been to
a dance in so long

15:57.072 --> 15:59.541
and he got so excited
when you mentioned it.

15:59.973 --> 16:02.310
Yeah, he's been
bugging me all weekend.

16:15.490 --> 16:17.292
Fudge.

16:17.324 --> 16:20.161
No, he's going to embarrass me.

16:20.194 --> 16:22.463
Embarrass you?

16:34.309 --> 16:37.411
You'll be the coolest kids
there.

17:26.261 --> 17:27.627
You guys look like idiots.

17:27.662 --> 17:30.298
Thanks dad.

17:30.330 --> 17:32.134
Rob, please don't say anything

17:32.166 --> 17:33.868
when Calissa is in the car,
okay?

17:33.902 --> 17:35.604
She still coming? Does she know
what they look like?

17:35.636 --> 17:37.873
Behave Mr. Luca.

17:37.905 --> 17:41.109
Okay fine.

17:46.513 --> 17:49.350
So Calissa,
You re ten years old?

17:49.384 --> 17:50.886
Yeah.

17:50.918 --> 17:53.454
You look beautiful, darling.

17:55.589 --> 17:57.592
She's ten?

18:12.639 --> 18:16.645
I'm so proud of you both. Look
at us, just one normal family.

18:18.512 --> 18:20.682
Let's take some photos.

18:22.450 --> 18:27.456
Okay. Smile. Smile. Smile Teddy.
Teddy, Teddy, smile.

18:31.459 --> 18:35.230
Smile Teddy. Teddy?

18:36.431 --> 18:37.632
Baby, let's get out of here
before anyone

18:37.665 --> 18:38.899
notices we know them.

18:38.933 --> 18:41.502
Wait, wait. How about one with
just you and Calissa then, Fran?

18:41.536 --> 18:46.508
Oh sure, Mrs. Luca.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.676
And one more with Teddy.

18:51.245 --> 18:52.413
Rargh.

18:52.446 --> 18:55.382
Stop it Ma,
you're embarrassing us.

18:55.415 --> 18:57.618
Okay then. Bye.

19:09.664 --> 19:11.967
Imagine if Ramsay
Street looked like this?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.969
I know.

19:20.340 --> 19:22.743
Okay, so just don't do
anything or say anything.

19:22.777 --> 19:25.313
The kids at
school can be monsters.

19:25.346 --> 19:26.448
Rargh.

19:26.481 --> 19:30.319
No, not like you bro.
Now look alive.

19:35.022 --> 19:37.458
Sorry about my
brother Cal. He's so lame.

19:37.492 --> 19:41.730
I think he's nice, Frankie.

19:41.762 --> 19:45.466
I really like what you're
wearing Teddy.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.769
You look like a big avocado.

19:47.801 --> 19:49.003
Rargh.

19:49.037 --> 19:52.473
You're funny.

19:52.507 --> 19:56.245
Teddy! Go make your own friends.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.562
Where's, where's Teddy?

20:50.697 --> 20:53.668
I don't know. Let's find him.

20:58.405 --> 21:01.108
Well, if it isn't Frankenstein's
brother, Teddy Bear.

21:01.142 --> 21:03.078
Long time no see, mate.

21:03.110 --> 21:04.678
Yeah, you look sick.

21:04.712 --> 21:07.415
You look like
Butch's uncle at the funeral.

21:07.447 --> 21:10.117
Brooklyn, that's insensitive.

21:10.151 --> 21:11.720
Oh, sorry, Butch.

21:11.752 --> 21:13.821
Your uncle was such a cool guy.

21:13.855 --> 21:15.589
Thanks.

21:15.623 --> 21:18.360
But he looks freaky anyway.

21:19.860 --> 21:22.496
You know what, Teddy Bear? I
never liked your sister.

21:22.530 --> 21:24.531
Actually. Yeah, you did.

21:24.565 --> 21:25.633
No, I didn't.

21:25.665 --> 21:26.701
Yeah, you did.

21:26.733 --> 21:27.702
No, I didn't

21:27.734 --> 21:28.837
Rargh.

21:28.869 --> 21:30.104
Want to start it?

21:30.137 --> 21:31.673
Keep it together man.

21:31.705 --> 21:33.375
Listen here you weirdo.

21:33.407 --> 21:34.708
Tell him.

21:34.742 --> 21:37.846
I don't like...

21:37.878 --> 21:39.146
You!

21:39.180 --> 21:41.550
Have you seen
Frankie's brother Teddy?

21:43.951 --> 21:46.454
Have you seen my brother?

21:52.159 --> 21:55.662
You know, Frankenstein gave me
one of her sandwiches once.

21:55.695 --> 21:59.166
It was peanut butter. I'm
allergic to peanut butter,

21:59.200 --> 22:01.436
but
it didn't really matter.

22:01.469 --> 22:05.407
But then I beat her up.

22:07.742 --> 22:10.712
Have you seen my brother?
He smells like dead people.

22:10.744 --> 22:11.678
What?

22:11.712 --> 22:13.147
Dead people.

22:13.181 --> 22:14.182
What?

22:14.214 --> 22:15.949
Dead... oh forget it.

22:15.982 --> 22:18.453
Okay.

22:18.485 --> 22:22.456
Frankie I know where Teddy is!
The girls said they saw Butch

22:22.490 --> 22:24.626
and Brooklyn take him outside.

22:26.828 --> 22:29.530
Looks like there s no one here
to help you anymore, Teddy Bear.

22:29.563 --> 22:31.565
Yeah, not so cool anymore, huh?

22:31.598 --> 22:34.001
Let's see how
deadly you can get.

22:34.801 --> 22:37.638
Rargh.

22:51.886 --> 22:54.923
Whoa man. I actually like
Francine. She's really cool

22:54.955 --> 22:57.524
and
she's good at art and stuff.

22:57.558 --> 23:00.194
And I think she's the prettiest
girl in the entire school.

23:00.228 --> 23:03.432
Rargh.

23:08.603 --> 23:10.004
He'll be alright.

23:10.037 --> 23:13.208
What happened to your hand?

23:13.241 --> 23:15.242
Oh, it's nothing.

23:15.276 --> 23:18.646
Teddy accidentally bit me
before. It's fine.

23:18.678 --> 23:21.015
Don't worry about it.

24:53.340 --> 24:54.242
How was the dance?

24:54.276 --> 24:56.945
Teddy bit Calissa
and now she s all white.

24:56.978 --> 25:00.749
Score! Go Teddy. You use tongue?

25:01.549 --> 25:05.953
I mean, don t worry Frank, she
was white before the dance too.

25:07.887 --> 25:10.657
I'm sorry, baby.
Did Teddy make any friends?

25:10.691 --> 25:11.960
Don't ask me.

25:11.992 --> 25:12.827
Teddy?

25:12.859 --> 25:14.862
Rargh.

25:48.963 --> 25:51.665
I m still not speaking to you.

25:54.068 --> 25:57.872
I can t believe you did that.
She was my friend. Mine.

25:57.905 --> 25:58.806
Rargh.

25:58.839 --> 26:02.010
Don t even try to explain.
I hate you bro.

26:14.754 --> 26:16.957
Teddy.

26:16.991 --> 26:19.661
Teddy.

26:20.427 --> 26:24.765
Go back to bed. It's bedtime.

26:24.799 --> 26:26.768
Teddy.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.403
Where are you going?

26:29.869 --> 26:32.040
Ma! Ma!

26:32.072 --> 26:34.841
Teddy's trying to eat you.

26:34.875 --> 26:36.810
Fran, why did you wake us up?

26:36.844 --> 26:39.013
I heard this noise and I
followed him into your room.

26:39.046 --> 26:42.750
And then I saw him crash down
next to your toes and...

26:42.782 --> 26:46.219
Fran. Stop yelling. You're
scaring Teddy.

26:46.252 --> 26:47.954
You haven't run
into my room scared,

26:47.988 --> 26:49.691
since you were a little boy.

26:49.723 --> 26:53.160
Rob, can you get Fran out of
here?

26:53.194 --> 26:57.464
It's alright. It's okay.

26:57.498 --> 27:01.102
But no! But what about mum?

27:01.135 --> 27:04.872
Pa! Pa! I swear, I followed him
into your room and then...

27:04.905 --> 27:07.175
Shut up, Frank! I don't know
what you have against Teddy,

27:07.207 --> 27:08.775
but
it stops now. Go to bed.

27:08.809 --> 27:09.777
But what about Ma?

27:09.809 --> 27:12.681
I don t care. Go to bed.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.960
Good night Teddy.

27:37.972 --> 27:41.509
Last night Francine, you woke us
up in the middle of the night

27:41.541 --> 27:44.212
and scared Teddy. And
so he had to sleep with us.

27:44.244 --> 27:45.479
Rargh.

27:45.512 --> 27:47.814
It was very
inconsiderate of you...

27:47.848 --> 27:49.817
Yeah, especially because it was
the weekend.

27:49.849 --> 27:52.052
And so your father and I have
decided you will spend the

27:52.086 --> 27:53.488
weekend in the chamber.

27:53.521 --> 27:54.821
Like a prison cell.

27:54.855 --> 27:56.223
Your meals will be brought in.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.392
You're in jail now.

27:57.425 --> 28:00.494
And if you need to go to the
bathroom, knock two times.

28:00.528 --> 28:03.064
Not allowed to pee in there.

28:03.097 --> 28:06.734
We would appreciate it, if this
doesn't happen again.

28:10.538 --> 28:12.941
In you go.

28:32.026 --> 28:35.196
I will eat you...

28:35.596 --> 28:38.266
Ma! Pa! Help me.

28:39.899 --> 28:42.035
Help me.

28:42.368 --> 28:43.971
What is it?

28:44.003 --> 28:47.141
Look, look!
On the cupboard at the back.

28:51.078 --> 28:52.113
What is it Frank?

28:52.146 --> 28:53.313
See.

28:59.019 --> 29:01.021
What have you
done to my cupboard?

29:01.055 --> 29:03.224
This is gonna take
ages to clean.

29:03.257 --> 29:05.259
There'd better be some sauce
left over for my dinner,

29:05.291 --> 29:06.260
you idiot.

29:06.292 --> 29:08.596
It says, I will eat you all.

29:08.628 --> 29:12.032
What is wrong with you Frank?
Look what you've done to the

29:12.066 --> 29:14.268
cupboard. My cupboard.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.303
It wasn't me. It was Teddy.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.606
That's enough of that.
No more of this talk.

29:18.638 --> 29:20.040
Teddy has done nothing wrong,

29:20.073 --> 29:23.043
and he's definitely
not trying to eat us.

29:52.005 --> 29:55.108
[LITTLE MISCHIEVOUS QUALITY[

30:26.005 --> 30:28.375
Smarty pants.

31:01.709 --> 31:04.445
I'm sorry Teddy.

32:02.136 --> 32:06.072
What the? What happened to
Teddy's arm?

32:06.106 --> 32:07.208
Rargh.

32:07.241 --> 32:09.577
We were playing
cricket and it fell off.

32:14.114 --> 32:17.385
Uh, stay there.

32:38.204 --> 32:40.508
Baby, it says that there have
been multiple biting attacks by

32:40.540 --> 32:42.475
adolescents in our area.

32:42.509 --> 32:45.813
Reckless. I hope we
catch those meddling kids

32:45.846 --> 32:46.580
and teach them a lesson.

32:48.482 --> 32:52.252
You'd never do anything like
that would you, Teddy?

32:52.286 --> 32:54.288
Rargh.

33:01.261 --> 33:04.831
Mum, Dad, I would just like to
say that I have been doing some

33:04.865 --> 33:09.136
research, and I have some very
worrying news to tell you.

33:09.168 --> 33:11.505
Teddy's a zombie.

33:16.143 --> 33:18.145
Now, I know
you don't believe me,

33:18.177 --> 33:21.281
but I'm telling you, he was
definitely trying to eat you

33:21.315 --> 33:23.417
when I woke you
both up the other night.

33:23.450 --> 33:26.386
Oh, were you Teddy? You were
probably using a knife and fork

33:26.419 --> 33:28.154
to eat our brains.

33:28.187 --> 33:32.425
Yes, that's right, except with
his fingers and his fingernails

33:32.459 --> 33:35.262
and his sharp chompers
biting into every...

33:50.577 --> 33:53.146
You have the right to remain
silent.

33:53.180 --> 33:56.117
You have the
right to remain silent.

33:56.149 --> 33:59.185
Anything you say or do can and

33:59.219 --> 34:01.489
will be used against
you in a court of law.

34:01.521 --> 34:05.458
Anything you say or do can and

34:05.492 --> 34:10.164
will be used against
you in a court of law.

34:10.196 --> 34:12.465
You have the right to an
attorney.

34:12.498 --> 34:14.667
You have the right to an
attorney.

34:16.303 --> 34:18.906
Okay, we'll finish that very
special poem off tomorrow,

34:18.938 --> 34:20.373
class.

34:21.706 --> 34:24.277
Tomorrow morning.

34:24.543 --> 34:26.379
Yeah.

34:30.248 --> 34:32.418
Francine.

34:32.452 --> 34:34.353
How are you my dear?

34:34.388 --> 34:36.556
Good.

34:36.589 --> 34:39.492
How's the family?

34:39.525 --> 34:41.261
Bad.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.231
What about you dad?
Is he alright?

34:45.264 --> 34:47.502
Has he locked
up any crims lately?

34:52.272 --> 34:55.676
Actually, while I've got you
here, I might ask you a couple

34:55.708 --> 35:00.714
of questions. Do any of these
look familiar to you?

35:14.694 --> 35:18.365
It's been a difficult time for
everyone. A lot of kids coming

35:18.397 --> 35:22.303
down with a virus, all those
attacks going on.

35:23.370 --> 35:26.272
Sounds suspicious to me. What do
you think, Officer Luca?

35:26.305 --> 35:28.309
Hmm?

35:33.247 --> 35:37.551
Now I'm no investigator, but I
have reason to believe...

35:37.584 --> 35:42.323
that some of those attacks have
been linked to children from

35:42.356 --> 35:44.658
this school.

35:48.327 --> 35:50.330
Maybe you want to take me down
to the station and take a

35:50.363 --> 35:52.332
statement.

35:55.736 --> 35:58.472
Now I'm not gonna name names
without an attorney present.

35:58.504 --> 36:00.441
But...

36:00.473 --> 36:02.642
let's just say there are some
pretty rough kids in this

36:02.676 --> 36:04.444
school.

36:07.446 --> 36:08.982
Ever stopped a bank robbery?

36:09.015 --> 36:09.983
Yeah.

36:10.017 --> 36:11.018
Ever fired a gun?

36:11.051 --> 36:12.019
Yep.

36:12.051 --> 36:13.586
Ever been in a high speed chase?

36:13.620 --> 36:17.424
Thank you Ms Green.
I'm so glad you brought us in.

36:17.457 --> 36:20.261
We will definitely
speak to Francine at home.

36:21.361 --> 36:24.365
That's my pleasure.

36:29.035 --> 36:32.505
Really. Anything I can do to
keep justice in this town.

36:33.406 --> 36:36.276
Justice!
(mock gun sounds)

36:38.077 --> 36:41.281
Don't worry.
I've got a permit for these.

36:41.714 --> 36:44.285
Alright.

36:46.352 --> 36:48.521
Okay.

36:59.633 --> 37:04.638
Hey Fran, we should talk. We
haven't DnM'd in ages.

37:07.106 --> 37:12.312
Hey Frangipani.
It's me, your mum.

37:15.548 --> 37:20.553
Mum, I don t feel good. First of
all, Teddy is trying to eat you.

37:20.720 --> 37:24.792
And Calissa, she's been
different. You know,

37:24.825 --> 37:27.428
since the dance.

37:27.461 --> 37:30.430
And worst of all,
I think Dad hates me.

37:30.464 --> 37:35.469
Oh darling. That s not true.
Your father loves you very much.

37:35.702 --> 37:40.607
And Teddy? Well he can act a bit
strange sometimes, but it's just

37:41.607 --> 37:43.876
a phase he's going through.

37:43.910 --> 37:48.883
It's those terrible teens. Did
you and Calissa have a fight?

37:49.149 --> 37:53.354
No. Calissa got bitten by Teddy
and now she's a zombie.

37:53.386 --> 37:57.423
Fran, chin up. Don t you worry
about her.

37:57.457 --> 38:00.394
She will realize what a huge
mistake she's made and come

38:00.426 --> 38:02.396
crawling back to you.

38:02.428 --> 38:04.731
Literally crawling.

38:23.749 --> 38:25.452
What's up Frank?

38:25.484 --> 38:26.620
Nothing.

38:26.653 --> 38:28.522
Okay then.

38:32.658 --> 38:35.396
So, how's your girlfriend?

38:35.428 --> 38:36.729
She's not my girlfriend.

38:36.763 --> 38:38.132
Aw, did you guys break up?

38:38.164 --> 38:40.700
No, Calissa's a zombie.

38:40.734 --> 38:43.504
I think she was a bit too tall
for you anyway. Cheer up.

38:43.537 --> 38:45.906
She's my BFFL, dad.

38:45.939 --> 38:49.643
What does that mean?

38:49.676 --> 38:53.147
Best friends for life.

38:53.180 --> 38:55.716
Just forget her, Frank.
Trust me,

38:55.749 --> 38:59.486
a frenemy is
no friend indeed.

39:15.702 --> 39:17.437
Aw, what now?

39:20.807 --> 39:22.843
He did it! He did it!

39:22.876 --> 39:24.711
What s wrong, honey?
What happened?

39:24.743 --> 39:28.515
Teddy ate my bunny, Booboo. I
went upstairs and I found little

39:28.548 --> 39:30.684
tiny bones under my pillow.

39:30.716 --> 39:33.986
Oh Fran, I'm so sorry. We'll go
get you another one on the

39:34.019 --> 39:35.655
weekend alright?

39:35.689 --> 39:39.193
Another one? It's his fault!
This is all Teddy's fault!

39:39.225 --> 39:42.463
You can't blame him. He only
gets like beef, chicken...

39:42.495 --> 39:43.763
Human brain.

39:43.796 --> 39:44.831
What did you say, miss?

39:44.865 --> 39:46.934
I said human brain.

39:46.966 --> 39:48.868
How dare you speak about your
brother like that.

39:48.901 --> 39:51.671
He's not my brother anymore.
He's a murderer.

39:51.705 --> 39:52.940
That's enough Frank.

39:52.972 --> 39:55.741
He attacked people at the dance.
He had blood all over his face

39:55.774 --> 39:57.211
from tearing their limbs apart.

39:57.243 --> 39:58.412
I said that's enough missy!

39:58.444 --> 40:00.948
Then he stole my best friend.
And when she trusted him,

40:00.981 --> 40:02.915
he
took a chunk out of her hand.

40:02.948 --> 40:04.651
Say sorry to your brother right
now, or else!

40:04.684 --> 40:08.254
He ate the only thing I love,
and now you're next!

40:08.287 --> 40:09.956
Well let's hope he
does us all a favor

40:09.990 --> 40:11.558
and gets rid of you first.

40:11.591 --> 40:12.893
Then finally, I won't
have to listen to all of

40:12.926 --> 40:14.027
your stupid lies!

40:14.060 --> 40:16.864
Rob! Fran! Everyone calm down!

40:17.631 --> 40:21.734
Fran, why don t you go find a
good place to bury Booboo

40:21.767 --> 40:25.772
darling. I'll talk to Teddy.

40:30.042 --> 40:34.682
Robert Luca, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

40:39.986 --> 40:42.656
So that wasn't cool, Teddy.

40:42.689 --> 40:45.526
Your father's right. You can't
go around eating other people's

40:45.559 --> 40:49.595
things. What you
need to do is apologize.

40:49.629 --> 40:50.864
Rargh?

40:50.897 --> 40:54.568
Oh I'm sick of you two ganging
up on Frank. She is such a sweet

40:54.600 --> 40:57.271
girl and you are
always so mean to her.

40:57.303 --> 41:00.840
This weekend Rob, you're going
to spend some quality time with

41:00.874 --> 41:03.877
your daughter
and get to know her.

41:03.910 --> 41:07.614
And Teddy, you're going to clean
the house with me.

41:07.647 --> 41:08.682
Rargh.

41:08.714 --> 41:12.685
So unfair. I want to clean the
house with Teddy.

41:25.832 --> 41:28.635
He was a beautiful bunny.

41:28.667 --> 41:30.903
It was a she.

41:30.937 --> 41:33.574
Oh well, there you go.

41:36.376 --> 41:39.946
Hey Fran, I know you've been
upset lately because Calissa

41:39.979 --> 41:41.615
backstabbed you,

41:41.647 --> 41:43.316
She didn't backstab me.

41:43.350 --> 41:46.019
But Pa has agreed to take you
out to a movie this weekend to

41:46.051 --> 41:47.320
get your spirits up.

41:47.354 --> 41:48.455
No.

41:48.488 --> 41:51.724
Yes. He really loves you
Francine and he wants to hang

41:51.758 --> 41:54.660
out. Just like we all used to.

41:54.693 --> 41:57.597
I'll tell him you can't wait.

42:23.689 --> 42:25.691
So...

42:25.725 --> 42:26.693
You go.

42:26.725 --> 42:27.693
No you.

42:27.727 --> 42:28.662
No, you first man.

42:28.694 --> 42:30.696
Go ahead Pa.

42:30.729 --> 42:34.834
I should anyway, I'm the oldest.
What do you want to do tonight?

42:34.868 --> 42:37.104
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

42:37.136 --> 42:40.841
I don't know.
Want to go to the movies?

42:40.874 --> 42:42.676
Yeah. What should we see?

42:42.709 --> 42:44.845
I don't know. What's good?

42:44.877 --> 42:47.146
Anything. You choose.

42:47.180 --> 42:50.149
Good idea, I'm the oldest.

43:38.865 --> 43:41.200
So... you like blowguns?

43:41.234 --> 43:42.469
What?

43:42.502 --> 43:44.004
Blowguns?

43:44.037 --> 43:45.272
What is that?

43:45.305 --> 43:48.040
You know the pipe that you blow
and then poisonous darts shoot

43:48.073 --> 43:49.041
out.

43:49.075 --> 43:51.078
Oh... I don't know.

43:51.778 --> 43:54.982
They're really coo, l
but deadly dangerous.

43:58.051 --> 44:00.087
Cool! I like drawing.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.455
Drawing's lame.

44:01.488 --> 44:02.856
No it's not.

44:02.888 --> 44:04.457
Since when?

44:04.490 --> 44:07.059
Since always.
Mum said it's great.

44:07.093 --> 44:10.097
Well Mum says that about
everything. Drawing is lame.

44:10.930 --> 44:13.934
So I think we spent
enough time together.

44:13.966 --> 44:15.167
Mum will be happy, aye?

44:15.200 --> 44:18.137
Yeah sure.

44:34.553 --> 44:37.223
Okay when I say laugh,
you need to laugh, alright.

44:37.256 --> 44:38.858
Why?

44:38.892 --> 44:41.227
To prove we had
a successful night.

44:41.260 --> 44:43.329
Ready? Now.

44:54.106 --> 44:59.112
Where is everyone? Marina?
Teddy?

45:01.013 --> 45:03.249
Something feels wrong, Pa.

45:03.283 --> 45:05.919
Nah. Don't worry about it.
They're probably just asleep.

45:05.952 --> 45:08.888
It's only eight o'clock.

45:12.024 --> 45:17.030
Oh hey baby. I missed you too.

45:18.298 --> 45:23.236
I didn't think we
were gone for that long.

45:23.269 --> 45:28.241
We had a fantastic time, we
saw... what was it?

45:28.274 --> 45:30.577
My mum's a zombie.

45:30.609 --> 45:31.745
You sure?

45:31.778 --> 45:34.046
Anyway, we went to dinner
afterwards and now we're the

45:34.080 --> 45:38.852
best of friends and I think
we're gonna keep her. See?

45:38.885 --> 45:41.254
Now, where's my newspaper?

46:14.620 --> 46:17.857
I see what you've done.
But you won't get me or Pa.

46:17.890 --> 46:19.593
It's over red-rover.

46:19.626 --> 46:21.294
Rargh.

46:23.095 --> 46:25.097
Rargh.

46:28.100 --> 46:31.338
Rargh.

46:31.370 --> 46:33.840
I hate you bro.

47:03.202 --> 47:08.175
Let go Teddy.
Let go of my hand. Let go!

47:09.175 --> 47:11.977
Oh thanks.

47:12.010 --> 47:13.312
Rargh.

47:22.088 --> 47:24.658
Good morning Frank.

47:24.691 --> 47:26.959
You're alive?

47:26.993 --> 47:29.996
More than ever.

47:30.028 --> 47:33.098
Ma, are you feeling alright?

47:33.131 --> 47:38.137
Of course darling. Sit down,
have some breakfast.

47:39.272 --> 47:42.075
What's this?

47:42.107 --> 47:45.345
It's salmon on toast, miss.

47:45.377 --> 47:49.383
Your mum's gone through a lot of
effort to make that.

47:49.982 --> 47:54.120
Because we
had fun last night.

47:55.120 --> 47:58.024
Look, Teddy's enjoying his.

48:04.731 --> 48:06.732
Pa, can I talk to you for a
minute?

48:06.765 --> 48:09.202
You're kidding, right?

48:19.479 --> 48:22.448
What? Didn't we spend enough
time together last night?

48:22.481 --> 48:25.284
I've got this weird feeling.

48:25.318 --> 48:26.752
Well, I think you
should talk to your mother

48:26.785 --> 48:28.320
about things like that.

48:28.354 --> 48:31.124
I think Ma got bit last night.

48:31.156 --> 48:33.026
What are you talking about
Frank?

48:33.059 --> 48:37.330
Raw fish. Since when
has Ma ever given us raw fish?

48:37.363 --> 48:40.232
Well maybe she's trying
something different.

48:40.265 --> 48:43.068
I mean, she knows I don't like
seafood, but sometimes women get

48:43.102 --> 48:44.738
an urge to eat weird food.

48:44.771 --> 48:46.473
When she was pregnant with you,
all she wanted to eat was

48:46.506 --> 48:48.107
rockmelon.

48:48.140 --> 48:51.043
I hate rockmelon.

48:51.077 --> 48:54.747
But Pa. This time I know it for
sure. Soon enough they are going

48:54.781 --> 48:57.183
to bite us and
we'll be one of them.

48:57.216 --> 49:00.453
You know, you're weird, Frank.
You're making stuff up.

49:00.486 --> 49:02.422
Now
hurry up and get inside.

49:02.455 --> 49:05.592
But Pa!

49:37.289 --> 49:40.125
So then the superhero girl comes
in and she saves the day,

49:40.158 --> 49:42.261
right Frank?

49:42.294 --> 49:46.332
Anyway thanks for dropping me
off baby. I love you.

49:47.332 --> 49:50.302
See you later tonight.

49:57.343 --> 49:59.346
I scared you.

50:03.281 --> 50:04.818
So...

50:04.850 --> 50:06.318
You're next.

50:06.352 --> 50:08.421
What?

50:08.453 --> 50:12.191
To be dropped off.

50:12.225 --> 50:13.460
Then...

50:17.497 --> 50:20.200
I'm going to eat you.

50:38.184 --> 50:42.222
Hi guys, wow, red
looks great on both of you.

50:43.022 --> 50:48.194
Hey, what's white,
black and read all over?

50:48.227 --> 50:52.365
Close. Newspaper.
Or zombie, I guess.

50:57.269 --> 51:01.406
I honestly don't think I'll be
that nice. I only eat greens.

51:01.439 --> 51:06.445
Like broccoli, peas, celery,
apples... oh no that's a fruit.

51:41.680 --> 51:45.351
Rargh.

52:39.738 --> 52:42.474
Rargh.

52:48.613 --> 52:52.351
Teddy, what's this?

52:52.685 --> 52:56.590
You want it,
yeah? Go get it!

53:33.693 --> 53:34.694
Psst.

53:37.062 --> 53:39.765
Psst, Pa.

53:39.798 --> 53:41.634
Psst, Pa.

53:42.368 --> 53:44.604
What? Why
you being so secretive.

53:44.636 --> 53:45.571
Shh. Come here.

53:45.604 --> 53:46.638
But I'm hungry.

53:46.671 --> 53:47.906
Hurry.

53:47.939 --> 53:50.809
Babe I'm home. Francine wants to
tell me something secretive in

53:50.843 --> 53:54.414
her room. Be there in a second.

54:01.419 --> 54:02.821
What is it Frank?

54:02.854 --> 54:04.690
Something's not right Pa.

54:04.723 --> 54:06.526
Oh, not this again.

54:06.559 --> 54:09.595
I've been thinking about it all
day. Ma wouldn't have locked up

54:09.627 --> 54:11.763
Teddy the night
we went out to the movies.

54:11.796 --> 54:14.399
They were
cleaning the house, remember?

54:14.432 --> 54:16.068
So he would have
bitten her then.

54:16.102 --> 54:17.170
What's your point Frank?

54:17.202 --> 54:19.871
I'm just saying, Pa,
she'll be a zombie in no time.

54:19.905 --> 54:21.673
It'll be us
against them.

54:21.707 --> 54:25.578
I'm hungry. Save this rubbish
for story time at school, okay.

54:25.611 --> 54:29.415
We don't have story time.
I'm in year five.

54:29.448 --> 54:34.321
I'm in year five and my name is
Frank and I think my family are

54:34.854 --> 54:36.823
zombies and
they're gonna eat me.

54:36.856 --> 54:38.091
Stop it.

54:38.124 --> 54:40.426
And my dad is an idiot because
he won't believe me and now his

54:40.459 --> 54:42.428
wife and his son
are gonna bite his head off.

54:42.461 --> 54:44.564
They are.
I'm trying to save you.

54:44.597 --> 54:49.102
If only, if only
my dad would believe me.

54:49.135 --> 54:52.604
And then I would save his life
and he would be forever

54:52.638 --> 54:55.107
grateful.

54:55.140 --> 54:59.878
I'm so alone. I'm a lone Frank
Frank Frank Frankie-furt.

55:00.845 --> 55:02.848
Are we done?

55:11.856 --> 55:14.726
Baby, what
are we eating tonight?

55:14.760 --> 55:17.930
Chicken. Teddy
helped me prepare it.

55:17.963 --> 55:21.633
Well done Teddy. Maybe you could
be the next Iron Chef.

55:24.769 --> 55:26.772
Let's tuck in.

55:38.484 --> 55:40.686
Well, I'm no chef, but I feel
like you've forgotten to do

55:40.718 --> 55:44.456
something Teddy. I think
you forgot to kill it first.

55:45.658 --> 55:49.662
Am I right? Baby? Baby?

56:27.700 --> 56:29.801
Is it safe? Can you eat a live

56:29.834 --> 56:31.736
chicken?
Don't you get salmonella?

56:31.769 --> 56:34.673
I told you! They are both
zombies now. We gotta let them

56:34.707 --> 56:36.676
go. We're next Pa.

56:36.709 --> 56:38.711
But maybe it s okay right?

56:39.278 --> 56:42.214
I knew it. Teddy's the worst!

56:42.247 --> 56:46.218
I eat raw vegetables, I eat raw
fruit. Maybe chicken's alright.

56:46.252 --> 56:49.622
Pa, they're zombies. Forget
them. We have to save ourselves.

56:51.624 --> 56:55.261
That makes a lot of sense. Like
last night, she was scratching

56:55.294 --> 56:57.497
and nibbling and...

56:57.530 --> 56:58.497
What?

56:58.531 --> 57:00.833
Never mind.

57:00.865 --> 57:04.569
We have to look after ourselves
Pa, otherwise they'll get us.

57:04.602 --> 57:05.838
Yeah?

57:06.872 --> 57:08.508
Yeah.

57:08.908 --> 57:10.043
Yeah.

57:11.042 --> 57:12.945
Yeah.

57:14.580 --> 57:15.548
Yeah.

57:29.928 --> 57:31.296
What?

57:31.330 --> 57:34.734
Go into the kitchen.

58:31.122 --> 58:33.959
You were supposed to go first.

58:44.102 --> 58:47.106
So I managed to get all the food
that could fit in my hands.

58:47.138 --> 58:50.008
Should last us a few days.
What about you?

58:50.042 --> 58:54.847
Well I got some handy tools.
Some nails, a hammer

58:56.848 --> 59:00.385
and some gaffer tape.

59:00.419 --> 59:03.122
That's it?

59:03.155 --> 59:05.091
What else was I supposed to get?

59:05.124 --> 59:06.826
I don't know. You're the cop.

59:06.859 --> 59:09.694
Whatever, as if you know
everything. Getting food.

59:09.727 --> 59:11.030
How is
that supposed to protect us?

59:11.062 --> 59:13.765
Well, we won't starve, will we?

59:13.798 --> 59:16.835
Well judging by your selection,
I might have to.

59:16.868 --> 59:19.704
I got all this life-saving
equipment to protect us from our

59:19.738 --> 59:22.908
loved ones barging in and
busting down that door.

59:32.751 --> 59:35.955
All done. Lock and load.

59:35.988 --> 59:38.758
Oh la-dee-da.

59:45.030 --> 59:48.167
Well done. Just to be safe.

59:55.173 --> 59:58.043
Thanks dad.

01:00:05.216 --> 01:00:07.886
Hey, Dad?

01:00:07.919 --> 01:00:10.722
Yeah?

01:00:10.756 --> 01:00:12.758
Thanks for
believing in me today.

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:15.428
I never thought Teddy would bite
Ma and Ma would become a zombie

01:00:15.461 --> 01:00:17.229
and they'd both
try to bite us next.

01:00:17.261 --> 01:00:21.434
But I'm glad I get to keep butts
with you. I mean, you're a

01:00:21.466 --> 01:00:24.069
policeman,
you kick butt all the time.

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:26.939
We'll work something out.

01:00:29.807 --> 01:00:33.011
Good night.

01:00:33.044 --> 01:00:35.048
Good night Frangipani.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.470
Have they gotten through?

01:00:57.502 --> 01:01:01.807
What? No. No
one gets through gaffer tape.

01:01:07.812 --> 01:01:09.816
I've got a plan.

01:01:26.131 --> 01:01:30.102
Frank today I'm
gonna show you how to fight.

01:01:30.135 --> 01:01:32.004
What? I can't fight.

01:01:32.037 --> 01:01:34.073
Don't be a loser.
I'm gonna teach you.

01:01:35.841 --> 01:01:38.944
Come on, how else are we gonna
beat these things?

01:01:38.977 --> 01:01:40.146
Fine.

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:46.252
Whoa. What are they?

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:47.520
Blowguns.

01:01:47.553 --> 01:01:49.088
They are so cool.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.057
They are friggin cool.
This one is from an ancient

01:01:52.089 --> 01:01:53.858
Mayan culture.

01:01:53.892 --> 01:01:56.529
And this one comes
from the Ming Dynasty in China.

01:01:56.562 --> 01:02:01.768
And this one? Was my
great-great-great-grandfather's.

01:02:04.169 --> 01:02:06.772
Let's go.

01:02:09.173 --> 01:02:10.575
Know how to shoot it?

01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:11.811
No.

01:02:11.843 --> 01:02:13.211
Know how to load the shaft?

01:02:13.245 --> 01:02:14.213
No.

01:02:14.245 --> 01:02:15.948
Know what a dart looks like?

01:02:15.981 --> 01:02:17.015
No.

01:02:17.048 --> 01:02:18.817
Why are you so lame?

01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:21.886
Actually, yeah,
I do know that one.

01:02:21.919 --> 01:02:23.990
Well, then let's get started.

01:02:53.986 --> 01:02:56.856
I can't do it.
I'm just not good enough.

01:02:56.888 --> 01:02:57.923
You're just not trying.

01:02:57.955 --> 01:02:58.990
I am trying.

01:02:59.024 --> 01:03:02.161
Well, then work harder.
And stop being a quitter.

01:03:02.193 --> 01:03:05.630
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I'm not Teddy.

01:03:05.664 --> 01:03:07.165
What is that supposed to mean?

01:03:07.198 --> 01:03:11.202
I know you hate me Pa.

01:03:11.236 --> 01:03:13.071
What Frank?

01:03:13.104 --> 01:03:15.073
Teddy has always
been your favorite even

01:03:15.106 --> 01:03:16.908
when he was a zombie.

01:03:16.941 --> 01:03:19.911
I'm just the loser,
the idiot, the quitter.

01:03:19.944 --> 01:03:21.948
That's enough.

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:29.088
When your brother came home sick that
day, I didn't know what it...

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.626
I didn't know what to do.
He'd changed.

01:03:33.658 --> 01:03:38.097
He said when he grew up he had
wanted to be like me, that he

01:03:38.129 --> 01:03:41.267
wanted to be a cop.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.338
And now I've lost that.

01:03:50.274 --> 01:03:54.881
Look, that's something that I've
been trying to find, that bond.

01:03:59.151 --> 01:04:01.921
But I haven't lost you yet.

01:04:01.953 --> 01:04:04.122
Then why do you
bully me all the time?

01:04:04.156 --> 01:04:05.191
What do you mean?

01:04:05.223 --> 01:04:08.426
You call me names
and lock me up in the chamber.

01:04:09.227 --> 01:04:12.397
If I knew that hurt you,
I would have stopped.

01:04:16.001 --> 01:04:19.272
I know I can be
harsh with you sometimes.

01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:22.675
But there's no one else I would
rather be with than you,

01:04:22.707 --> 01:04:26.444
if we're about to face a family
zombie attack.

01:04:29.747 --> 01:04:33.049
So let's try that shot again.

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:49.595
It's Calissa. I think she wants
to speak to you.

01:05:52.464 --> 01:05:54.232
What will I say?

01:05:54.265 --> 01:05:58.269
Maybe you should say... Rargh.

01:05:59.805 --> 01:06:02.307
No Pa, I'm serious.

01:06:02.339 --> 01:06:06.211
Oh okay. Okay.

01:06:06.243 --> 01:06:08.814
If you go out there, then maybe
you can sort it out.

01:06:08.847 --> 01:06:13.084
If she's really your BFFL, then
this is your chance to make up.

01:06:13.118 --> 01:06:16.121
This is your chance to build a
bridge and create a relationship

01:06:16.153 --> 01:06:18.523
that will last forever.

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:20.392
You're right.

01:06:20.425 --> 01:06:22.428
Take this.

01:06:23.294 --> 01:06:26.197
No, she'll never hurt me.

01:06:26.231 --> 01:06:28.566
Well then, take the gaff.

01:06:40.178 --> 01:06:41.614
Bye.

01:06:50.455 --> 01:06:52.157
You're here.

01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:53.425
Rargh.

01:06:53.457 --> 01:06:55.827
Listen Cal, I never got to say
thank you for sticking up for me

01:06:55.861 --> 01:06:57.162
the other day.

01:06:57.194 --> 01:06:58.430
Rargh.

01:06:58.463 --> 01:07:01.633
Wait! How can this work? You're
a zombie now. How will I know

01:07:01.665 --> 01:07:05.136
it's me you really want rather
than brains and flesh?

01:07:06.171 --> 01:07:09.174
How can I sleepover at night
knowing you're awake, planning

01:07:09.207 --> 01:07:10.843
my death?

01:07:10.876 --> 01:07:13.644
What if I don't like raw meat?
And I just want a traditional

01:07:13.678 --> 01:07:15.881
mud cake for our
joint birthday party?

01:07:15.914 --> 01:07:20.519
I don't want two cakes. I want
one cake, Cal, shared.

01:07:20.551 --> 01:07:22.620
Rargh.

01:07:22.653 --> 01:07:26.324
But you're dead Calissa. There's
no way for us. A zombie and

01:07:26.357 --> 01:07:28.359
human, that's unheard of.

01:07:28.392 --> 01:07:31.597
Everywhere we go people will
judge us for being together, for

01:07:31.629 --> 01:07:34.666
holding hands in public, for
caring for one another.

01:07:42.374 --> 01:07:45.209
Rargh. Rargh rargh rargh. Rargh
rargh rargh. Rargh.

01:07:45.243 --> 01:07:47.146
Ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-rargh.

01:07:47.178 --> 01:07:49.347
No Calissa, no biting.

01:07:49.381 --> 01:07:53.218
Rargh. Rargh rargh rargh. Rargh.

01:07:53.251 --> 01:07:56.888
You're so right. Hey, I've never
asked someone this before, but

01:07:56.921 --> 01:07:59.390
will you be my best friend?

01:07:59.423 --> 01:08:01.526
Rargh.

01:08:23.546 --> 01:08:26.584
Oh man. Not you guys again.

01:08:28.685 --> 01:08:31.256
You know what? I'm sick of this.

01:08:31.287 --> 01:08:35.259
All my life I've been treated
badly. I've been called names

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:38.930
by my Pa, beaten up by you guys
and my Ma and Bro have tried to

01:08:38.962 --> 01:08:44.169
eat me. But today it ends. The
only person fighting my battles

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:47.171
is me.

01:08:49.975 --> 01:08:52.944
Now please, stop bullying
me. It makes me feel sad and

01:08:52.977 --> 01:08:56.214
anxious. And it
sometimes gives me a rash.

01:08:56.247 --> 01:08:58.517
And I feel you have some issues
that you might want to talk to

01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:00.218
the school nurse about.

01:09:00.252 --> 01:09:02.988
Oi Frank! You're surrounded.
Get out of there!

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.223
Grab on to the gaff.

01:09:07.559 --> 01:09:09.627
Best friends for life!

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.662
Rargh.

01:09:23.006 --> 01:09:25.243
Hey listen, I'm going to go and
get us some help.

01:09:25.276 --> 01:09:27.613
What? You can't leave me.

01:09:27.645 --> 01:09:28.845
It's okay. You stay here.

01:09:28.881 --> 01:09:31.316
I'm the man of the house and
I'll protect us. I'll go down to

01:09:31.348 --> 01:09:33.484
the station
and call for more backup.

01:09:33.517 --> 01:09:36.254
But there's
zombies out there Dad.

01:09:36.287 --> 01:09:39.457
Don't worry about them. I'm
awesome. If they come up to me,

01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:40.524
I'll punch them in the face.

01:09:40.559 --> 01:09:45.328
Or you can get in with your
perfect shot Frank.

01:09:45.363 --> 01:09:47.365
Okay.

01:09:49.033 --> 01:09:51.370
But come home soon.

01:09:53.305 --> 01:09:56.809
It's alright. Look at me,
I'm unstoppable.

01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:08.454
See you soon Dad.

01:10:20.332 --> 01:10:25.303
Marina. Baby,
you look so...

01:10:25.337 --> 01:10:28.540
So sexy.

01:10:34.546 --> 01:10:37.516
That was super quick Pa.
You really are a superhero!

01:10:37.548 --> 01:10:39.051
Did you
see any zombies?

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:42.421
Yeah. yeah. And I had to fight
them all off. All good though.

01:10:42.454 --> 01:10:45.757
You're the best dad.

01:10:45.789 --> 01:10:48.659
Hey Frank.
I've got to be honest.

01:10:48.693 --> 01:10:51.730
Something
happened out there.

01:10:51.762 --> 01:10:55.566
I miss you so so much. I love
you baby.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.602
Rargh.

01:10:57.635 --> 01:11:00.705
Oh Pa, how could you?
That's gross.

01:11:00.739 --> 01:11:04.476
Yeah, well, sometimes a woman
can be irresistible.

01:11:04.508 --> 01:11:06.477
But Pa, she's a deadbeat.

01:11:06.511 --> 01:11:09.315
Don't say that
about your mother.

01:11:10.114 --> 01:11:12.783
Anyway, I got bitten.

01:11:12.816 --> 01:11:14.819
What? Where?

01:11:14.852 --> 01:11:16.587
Where you can't see it.

01:11:20.158 --> 01:11:21.727
She bit my lip.

01:11:23.895 --> 01:11:27.899
So I think it'd be like two
days, maybe three,

01:11:27.931 --> 01:11:29.700
before I become full zombie,
depending on how

01:11:29.734 --> 01:11:31.102
deep the bite was.

01:11:31.136 --> 01:11:34.406
So, I think
it's best if I just leave.

01:11:34.439 --> 01:11:35.841
But Dad you can't go.

01:11:35.873 --> 01:11:38.809
Come on.
Don't make this any harder.

01:11:38.842 --> 01:11:42.880
Listen, I just want
to say I'm proud.

01:11:44.748 --> 01:11:47.852
You're both sensitive and tough,
and the way you handled those

01:11:47.886 --> 01:11:51.123
bullies out there.
That was mad, Frank.

01:11:51.155 --> 01:11:53.624
And you're a
natural with a blowgun

01:11:53.658 --> 01:11:58.597
and you follow your gut
and if you wanted, you

01:11:58.629 --> 01:12:01.766
would be the best police officer
this world has ever seen.

01:12:05.602 --> 01:12:07.905
I love you Frangipani.

01:12:08.906 --> 01:12:11.909
I love you too Dad.

01:12:24.855 --> 01:12:26.858
Time for a new piece of gaff.

01:13:30.922 --> 01:13:35.928
Ah my arm.
Oh baby my neck. No don't.

01:13:37.995 --> 01:13:39.564
Dad.

01:13:39.596 --> 01:13:42.833
Argh., Ow, Oh, please.

01:13:42.867 --> 01:13:43.967
Dad.

01:13:44.002 --> 01:13:45.937
I have to do a marathon
tomorrow. If you can just only

01:13:45.970 --> 01:13:48.906
take chunks that aren't
compatible with breathing.

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.709
Dad?

01:13:50.742 --> 01:13:51.976
What now?

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:54.846
You're alive? Yes!

01:13:54.878 --> 01:13:58.983
Geez that sucks. It really
hurts. I think they just wanted

01:13:59.016 --> 01:14:01.019
to infect me some more.

01:14:01.485 --> 01:14:03.921
You're gonna
hate it when we get you.

01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:29.106
No more Zombie Ma.

01:15:36.381 --> 01:15:39.584
No more Zombie Pa!

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:47.159
And no more Zombie Bro!

01:20:04.047 --> 01:20:07.151
It's Clacilla, Clarissa...
what's her name?

01:21:18.021 --> 01:21:22.059
Okay, okay....

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:27.265
Teddy eat that fish... steak.

01:21:29.266 --> 01:21:32.303
I've got a plan.

01:22:15.279 --> 01:22:18.082
Great work today Frank.

01:22:18.114 --> 01:22:23.120
Thanks Pa. Geez, you bad father.
You're always so bad.

01:22:25.422 --> 01:22:27.425
I love you honey bunny.

01:22:30.093 --> 01:22:35.100
Cheeky little ears. I'll put you
in a dress. Hmm.

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:41.006
Let's tuck in.

01:22:45.376 --> 01:22:48.279
You're back son. You're back.

01:22:54.452 --> 01:22:55.119
And cut.

01:22:55.151 --> 01:22:56.020
Cut.

01:22:57.454 --> 01:22:59.123
Was that a wrap.

01:23:00.456 --> 01:23:04.367
