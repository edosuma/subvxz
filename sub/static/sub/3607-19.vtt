00:02.001 --> 00:03.419
Previously on Lost:

00:03.504 --> 00:05.463
You didn't tell us your condition.

00:05.547 --> 00:09.008
My condition is not an issue.
I've lived with it for four years.

00:09.093 --> 00:11.177
I'll get you on a plane back to Sydney.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.845
I don't want to go to Sydney!

00:12.930 --> 00:16.557
You don't know who you're dealing with.
Don't tell me what I can't do!

00:17.142 --> 00:19.686
This is my destiny!

00:19.770 --> 00:22.522
I'm supposed to do this, damn it!

00:22.606 --> 00:26.192
How do you open a hatch
that has no handle, no latch,

00:26.276 --> 00:28.403
no discernible way of opening it?

00:36.954 --> 00:38.454
What's that?

00:39.623 --> 00:41.541
A game.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.127
My favorite game.
I used to play with my brother.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.753
It's called Mouse Trap.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.631
How do you play?

00:48.716 --> 00:51.050
You start with
all these parts off the board

00:51.135 --> 00:54.637
and then, one by one

00:54.722 --> 00:57.056
you build the trap.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.225
Shoe. Bucket. Tub.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.519
Piece by piece,
it all comes together.

01:01.603 --> 01:06.065
And then you wait till your opponent
lands here on the old Cheese Wheel,

01:06.150 --> 01:07.942
then if you set it up
just right,

01:08.026 --> 01:11.404
you spring the trap.

01:13.449 --> 01:15.032
Go ahead, kiddo.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.330
May I help you, ma'am?

01:22.332 --> 01:24.459
Yes...

01:24.543 --> 01:27.086
Could you tell me
where the footballs are?

01:27.171 --> 01:30.298
Yeah. Aisle eight for regulation.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.924
Aisle fifteen for Nerf.

01:32.468 --> 01:34.469
Yes, thank you.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.982
You want my opinion?

01:49.067 --> 01:51.110
Boone, you gotta
have some faith.

01:51.195 --> 01:55.281
All we gotta do is break the glass,
and then we're in.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.492
Trebuchet delivers
half a ton of force.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.952
Why is it a trebuchet?
Looks like a catapult.

02:00.037 --> 02:04.248
It's called a trebuchet,
because it's a trebuchet.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.792
I don't get you, man.

02:05.876 --> 02:09.419
One minute you're quoting Nietzsche,
now you're an engineer.

02:09.505 --> 02:12.131
I don't think
I can spell "trebuchet."

02:12.216 --> 02:14.008
There's a T on the end.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.969
I'm serious.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.930
We've been coming here every day,

02:19.014 --> 02:20.723
you never talk about yourself.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.850
Everybody's got a story.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.977
My story would bore you.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.667
Three. Two. One.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.977
This was supposed to work.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.815
- This was supposed to work!
- John!

03:13.402 --> 03:14.569
Your leg, man.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.921
You okay?

03:37.509 --> 03:38.926
Yeah.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.137
I'm fine.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.657
Your trebuchet.
Why didn't it work?

04:42.741 --> 04:45.284
It didn't work because
it wasn't strong enough.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.495
That won't break,
whatever it's made of.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.081
Everything breaks
if you apply the right force.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.833
We'll build another invention
and hope it works?

04:52.918 --> 04:54.168
That's right.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.547
- What if it doesn't?
- The island will tell us what to do.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.466
What's that?

05:02.219 --> 05:04.512
We should get back there.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.847
Salvage those pieces.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.768
Your leg okay?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.521
It's fine.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.567
Night, John.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.424
You all right, guy?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.024
Hey! Hey!

05:58.108 --> 05:59.859
- You following me?
- I'm sorry.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.028
Who are you?

06:02.738 --> 06:04.113
I'm your mother.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.789
Look, Ms...

06:15.333 --> 06:17.752
I don't know why you think
I'm your son

06:17.836 --> 06:20.880
- or how you found me, but...
- You're adopted, aren't you?

06:20.964 --> 06:23.966
No, I was raised in a foster home.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.053
Well, several foster homes, actually.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.180
Look, I don't mean to be rude.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.558
What do you want from me?

06:33.852 --> 06:37.313
I want to tell you that you're special.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.982
Very special.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.734
You are part of a design.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.404
You do realize that, don't you?

06:45.489 --> 06:47.323
That our meeting, me finding you,

06:49.034 --> 06:51.869
this is a sign of things to come.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.830
Great things.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.460
My father...

07:02.339 --> 07:04.256
...is he still alive?

07:04.341 --> 07:05.841
Still alive?

07:08.345 --> 07:12.431
Oh, John, don't you understand?

07:12.516 --> 07:15.017
You don't have a father.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.188
You were immaculately conceived.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.536
- Which one?
- That one.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.331
You're sure? This is the one I've
been using, and nothing's happening.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.626
- I'm sorry it's not helping.
- What's not helping?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.546
Nothing.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.884
Thanks anyway.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.386
Nice garden.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.601
What was that all about?

07:57.686 --> 07:59.145
He has headaches.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.439
Doesn't the guy have aspirin
stashed away somewhere?

08:02.524 --> 08:06.068
He says aspirin didn't help.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.077
Can I ask you a question?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.663
Say you're having bad headaches.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.249
- Every day.
- You okay?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.084
Yeah. I'm fine.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.337
So, who are we talking
about then, Kate?

08:25.422 --> 08:27.047
Sawyer.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.342
There might be something
wrong with him.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.510
- What does he think?
- Says he's fine...

08:32.596 --> 08:35.139
- Then he's fine.
- He could be playing it down.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.308
- There could be something...
- Look...

08:37.392 --> 08:40.519
I'd love to check the guy out
and make sure he's okay,

08:40.604 --> 08:44.356
but we both know all I'm gonna get
for my trouble is a snappy one-liner,

08:44.441 --> 08:47.026
and if I'm real lucky,
a brand-new nickname.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.777
I'm just over it.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.786
You're late.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.831
- Late for what?
- Late for work.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.751
- I think I'm done working.
- I'm sorry. What?

09:03.835 --> 09:05.502
This is useless.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.214
You can't open that thing up.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.716
- Don't tell me what I can't do.
- You get it?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.219
It's a dead end.
You're not getting in.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.179
We didn't find this by accident.

09:15.263 --> 09:19.099
- We're supposed...
- We're supposed to find this, right?

09:19.184 --> 09:20.768
We're supposed to open it.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.603
Then tell me something.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.814
If we're supposed to open it,
why haven't we opened it yet?

09:28.985 --> 09:31.904
- The island will send us a sign.
- "The island will..."

09:31.988 --> 09:35.074
All that's happening now
is our faith is being tested.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.409
We will open it.
The island will show us how.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.537
What kind of sign
will the island send us?

09:49.547 --> 09:51.340
Did you see that?

09:53.551 --> 09:54.551
Boone?

10:03.728 --> 10:07.773
Theresa falls up the stairs.
Theresa falls down the stairs.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.608
Theresa falls up the stairs...

10:09.693 --> 10:12.903
Theresa falls down the stairs.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.572
No.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.116
Please don't.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.119
Don't take it back.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.981
Wake up.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.692
- What time is it?
- It's morning. Come on.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.361
Okay. I'm up.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.115
What's going on?

11:00.410 --> 11:02.119
Come on. Let's go.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.333
Emily Annabeth Locke,

11:07.417 --> 11:09.752
in ten thousand words or less.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.968
So, she's my mother.

11:18.053 --> 11:21.347
I lifted some hairs from her car,
and matched them with your DNA.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.474
It's 99 percent certain.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.353
She was institutionalized.
A few times.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.356
- What for?
- Nothing criminal or violent.

11:30.440 --> 11:34.318
It's a type of schizophrenia.
If she stays on her meds, she's okay.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.949
What about my father?

11:43.078 --> 11:46.955
Here's the thing. Your mother
sought you out, so she's fair game.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.458
But this guy,

11:49.542 --> 11:52.044
maybe he doesn't even know you exist.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.172
Now, I've done this
enough times to know...

11:55.924 --> 12:00.219
...this stuff isn't meant to be,
even though it may feel that way.

12:00.303 --> 12:03.639
Look, this probably
won't have a happy ending.

12:06.810 --> 12:11.271
So, do you want it or not?

12:13.066 --> 12:15.109
I want it.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.327
- Your name is?
- John Locke.

12:25.412 --> 12:29.581
- I'm Anthony Cooper's son.
- Mr. Cooper doesn't have a son.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.254
Tell him I don't want anything.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.880
My mother is Emily Locke.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.299
Please.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.302
Just a minute.

12:43.805 --> 12:47.099
Mr. Cooper, I got John Locke here,
says he's your son.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.851
Yes, sir.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.061
Well, you can go on in, sir.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.532
Well...

13:04.993 --> 13:07.244
This is awkward.

13:08.621 --> 13:12.958
Thank you for seeing me, sir.
I'm... John.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.630
Something tells me I'm gonna
want a drink for this?

13:18.715 --> 13:21.300
- You want a drink?
- Yeah. All right. Great.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.803
- Scotch okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.599
So who found who?

13:28.683 --> 13:30.726
- I'm sorry, sir?
- Emily. Your mother.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.312
Did she find you, or did you find her?

13:33.396 --> 13:35.481
She found me.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.940
How did she look?

13:37.025 --> 13:40.569
- All right, I guess.
- She say anything about me?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.780
She said I didn't have a father.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.951
That I was immaculately conceived.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.080
Really?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.418
Well, I guess that makes me God, huh?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.796
I didn't know you existed until a year
after you were born.

13:59.881 --> 14:04.510
She told me she wasn't gonna
have the baby, you, at all.

14:04.594 --> 14:09.056
She drops off the face of the planet.
She turns up asking for money,

14:09.140 --> 14:11.183
telling me she put you up for adoption.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.268
You gonna drink that or what?

14:16.105 --> 14:17.856
You have a family of your own?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.945
- No, sir.
- Me neither.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.947
I tried it a couple times.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.533
Didn't take.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.160
- Do you hunt?
- No.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.329
You're not an animal rights nut-job?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.373
No, sir.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.458
What are you doing this Sunday?

14:37.794 --> 14:40.462
- Nothing.
- You wanna go hunting?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.716
Well, I'd like that.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.510
Yeah, I'd like that very much.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.350
I had a dream last night.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.227
I asked for a sign.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.980
And then I saw
a plane crash.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.898
A Beechcraft.
Right out there.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.359
It was a dream, but...

15:02.443 --> 15:07.072
...it was the most real thing
I've ever experienced.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.742
- I know where to go now.
- Go for what?

15:10.827 --> 15:13.161
To find what we need
to open this bastard up.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.164
You using that paste that
made me see my sister get eaten?

15:16.249 --> 15:18.292
No, Boone.

15:19.460 --> 15:23.046
'Cause, I gotta tell you,
signs and dreams and...

15:23.131 --> 15:24.840
Who's Theresa?

15:27.635 --> 15:29.720
- What?
- "Theresa falls up the stairs.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.972
Theresa falls down the stairs."

15:35.268 --> 15:38.395
You were saying that in the dream.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.816
- How would you know about that?
- I don't know,

15:42.900 --> 15:44.985
but we're supposed to go to this place.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.572
We're supposed to find that plane.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.158
Will you come with me?

16:09.761 --> 16:13.388
I was gonna ask you how this was going,
but it's coming together fast.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.307
Fire wasn't a total loss.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.934
We learned things
from building the first one,

16:18.019 --> 16:20.479
which is saving us
from trial and error.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.564
Now it's just...

16:23.566 --> 16:25.400
...trial.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.237
Yeah.
Yeah, man, I know.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.114
"Now, now."

16:31.199 --> 16:32.824
Picking up a little Korean?

16:32.909 --> 16:36.578
Yeah. I'm pretty sure I know
how to say "faster" and "idiot."

16:50.593 --> 16:53.011
I hear you're having trouble
with your head.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.848
Now she got you making house calls?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.559
You're sensitive to the light too?

16:59.644 --> 17:01.853
- I'm sensitive to you...
- All right.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.438
We'll see you.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.025
Doc!

17:09.319 --> 17:11.655
Sensitivity to the light, that bad?

17:11.739 --> 17:14.574
- Depends.
- On what?

17:14.659 --> 17:16.867
On what's causing your headaches.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.621
It's not like it's a tumor or something.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.002
- What makes you think it's a tumor?
- I don't.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.296
Great.
Okay then.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.050
My uncle...

17:35.513 --> 17:39.891
...he died of a brain tumor.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.518
Yeah?

17:43.521 --> 17:45.856
That run in the family?
Tumors?

17:45.940 --> 17:48.233
What type of tumor was it?

17:48.317 --> 17:49.776
The type that kills you.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.696
Do you smell anything funny?

17:52.780 --> 17:56.283
Brain tumors bring on phantom smells.
Like something burning.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.078
Just headaches.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.789
Well, I'm sure you're fine, then.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.377
If this is worrying you,
there's tests I could do.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.879
Sorry, doc.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.505
Sounds fun, but...

18:11.632 --> 18:13.300
...my insurance ran out.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.140
Insurance ran out.
That's a good one.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.568
I could've mentioned her name
out by the hatch one day.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.279
- Who?
- Theresa.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.907
Maybe I was talking to myself.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.200
Maybe.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.536
But you didn't.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.791
So, in this dream
you saw a plane crash, right?

18:45.875 --> 18:46.875
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.169
The fact that we were
just in a plane crash,

18:49.253 --> 18:51.129
you didn't think for one second...

18:51.214 --> 18:54.090
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.220
- What is wrong with your leg?
- I'm fine.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.184
What?

19:11.651 --> 19:14.402
Someone from camp
hiked all the way out here?

19:16.447 --> 19:18.573
- Nope.
- Where do you think it came from?

19:27.250 --> 19:28.542
Him.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.970
- Morning, Eddie.
- Morning, Mr. Locke.

19:40.054 --> 19:42.138
- You gonna get birds again?
- I hope so.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.276
Anthony?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.820
You weren't supposed
to be here till 12:00.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.698
I thought you said 11:00.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.456
- What is this?
- It's a dialysis machine.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.125
My kidney's failing.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.086
Damn doctors say I need a transplant.

20:13.170 --> 20:16.339
- When?
- Tomorrow, if it were up to me.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.466
I'm on the donor list.

20:18.551 --> 20:22.137
But I'm an old man,
and it's a long list.

20:22.972 --> 20:27.017
- How long...
- The dialysis will be fine for awhile.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.436
I didn't tell you for this exact reason.

20:29.520 --> 20:33.523
I'm not gonna let this spoil
a fantastic day, and neither should you.

20:33.608 --> 20:37.360
I'll get done here,
and we'll have a nice lunch

20:37.445 --> 20:40.113
and go shoot some birds.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.869
He was a priest.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.746
How long you think
he's been dead?

20:47.830 --> 20:50.498
Clothing would decompose
within two years,

20:50.583 --> 20:52.876
but this is high-quality polyester.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.880
Could be two years, could be ten.
Gold teeth.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.298
Obviously well-off.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.763
- What kind of money is that?
- Nigerian naira.

21:06.182 --> 21:10.185
What is a Nigerian priest doing
on an island in the South Pacific?

21:12.021 --> 21:14.397
I'm not so sure he was a priest.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.797
You wanna keep it down?

21:45.054 --> 21:47.138
- That's it. Get up.
- What?

21:48.099 --> 21:49.724
Get up.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.561
- You're going to Jack.
- Do I get a lollipop?

21:54.981 --> 21:59.234
- When did the headaches start?
- A few days ago. A week maybe.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.613
Do you have to be here?

22:03.698 --> 22:05.824
Do you have them when you wake up?

22:05.908 --> 22:08.243
Usually they hit me middle of the day.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.079
What are you doing with that?

22:11.163 --> 22:14.249
Checking how your pupils respond
to changing stimuli.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.505
What's that? That nod.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.882
- Let him do his thing.
- I am, but I wanna know

22:22.967 --> 22:25.844
- what he thinks I should...
- Shut up and relax.

22:26.470 --> 22:29.681
- What are you doing?
- You ever had a blood transfusion?

22:29.765 --> 22:32.267
What? No.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.853
- Taken pills for malaria?
- Nope.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.480
Have you ever had sex with a prostitute?

22:40.276 --> 22:43.570
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Is that a yes?

22:47.116 --> 22:48.616
Yes.

22:50.286 --> 22:53.663
And have you ever contracted
a sexually transmitted disease?

22:55.624 --> 22:58.626
I'm gonna take that as another yes.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.754
When was the last outbreak?

23:01.464 --> 23:03.381
Go to hell, doc.

23:07.011 --> 23:10.597
- I know he deserved it, but...
- He needs glasses.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.148
What's going on?

23:20.232 --> 23:21.691
Nothing.

23:22.985 --> 23:26.738
- You can barely walk, man.
- It's the wound from the shrapnel.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.617
That's your right.
What's with your left?

23:30.701 --> 23:32.786
I'm fine.
Now stop asking.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.414
- That's it. Let's go back.
- I'm fine.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.583
No, you're not.
Let me get you to Jack.

23:38.667 --> 23:42.420
No. Jack wouldn't know the first thing
about what's wrong with me.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.844
- We've gotta go back.
- No.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.347
What is wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

23:52.431 --> 23:55.350
- I was in a wheelchair.
- What?

23:55.434 --> 23:58.353
Paralyzed. For four years.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.730
The plane, our plane,

24:00.815 --> 24:04.692
I was in that chair when we took off,
but not after we crashed.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.444
Why were you in a wheelchair?

24:06.529 --> 24:09.489
That doesn't matter anymore.

24:09.573 --> 24:13.618
But this island, it changed me.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.453
It made me whole.

24:15.538 --> 24:18.915
Now it's trying to take it back,
and I don't know why.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.420
But it wants me to follow what I saw.

24:24.505 --> 24:25.797
I know it sounds crazy.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.258
Four weeks ago,
I wouldn't have believed it.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.093
We are here for a reason.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.263
There's something that
we were meant to find.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.473
It's gonna help us get into the hatch.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.016
I know it.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.019
But we gotta keep going.

24:44.358 --> 24:47.485
Okay. Can you move your legs?

24:49.071 --> 24:50.613
Just help me up, son.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.168
These doves fly a lot faster
than you think.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.003
So you gotta really lead them.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.088
If you have to drop it in high cover...

25:14.013 --> 25:16.431
- Got him.
- Yeah, you did.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.641
Good shot, son.

25:24.481 --> 25:28.943
John, your mother,
she may be a little crazy,

25:29.028 --> 25:31.362
but at least she brought us together.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.033
And thank God it happened now,

25:35.117 --> 25:37.118
while we still have time.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.708
Let's find your bird.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.768
She was my nanny.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.189
Theresa, she was my nanny.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.733
My mother wasn't around much.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.277
I needed someone to take it out on.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.905
My bedroom was at the top
of a flight of stairs.

26:13.989 --> 26:17.325
And I would sit in bed all day,
calling her on the intercom.

26:18.786 --> 26:21.454
One day she took a bad step.
Broke her neck.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.667
I was six.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.012
What the hell is so funny?

26:53.988 --> 26:57.657
- Is that the plane you saw?
- As best I can tell.

26:58.742 --> 27:03.288
- You really saw it?
- Yeah. I really saw it.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.999
How long do you think
it's been there?

27:06.083 --> 27:09.294
Doesn't matter.
What's important is that we found it.

27:09.378 --> 27:12.505
What's important is what's inside it.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.592
What is inside of it?

27:17.594 --> 27:21.055
You're gonna have to climb up there
for us and find out.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.749
You can still change your mind.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.626
No. They already shaved my back.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.424
I'm so thankful for you.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.387
This was meant to be.

28:07.603 --> 28:10.396
See you on the other side, son.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.282
If you're looking for a stool sample,
you can forget it.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.286
You've been reading a lot...

28:25.371 --> 28:27.413
...since we came to the island.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.831
Okay. So what?

28:32.503 --> 28:34.420
You...

28:34.505 --> 28:36.339
You've got...

28:37.758 --> 28:41.386
- You've got hyperopia.
- Hyperopia?

28:45.349 --> 28:47.183
That's...

28:49.311 --> 28:51.604
- What is that?
- You're farsighted.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.565
- Farsighted?
- Yeah.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.985
It can develop later in life
when you add a new strain to the eyes.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.987
Like with reading.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.581
Blurry.

29:18.966 --> 29:20.133
Better or worse?

29:22.678 --> 29:24.178
Worse.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.224
No way.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.309
It's not a fashion show.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.309
Very funny.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.311
Dude.

30:13.395 --> 30:16.772
Looks like someone
steamrolled Harry Potter.

30:21.195 --> 30:23.571
You love this, don't you?

30:25.365 --> 30:26.782
You're welcome.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.398
Hang on.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.678
I'm fine.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.251
What do you see?

32:45.756 --> 32:48.007
You wanna know
what's in your damn plane?

32:51.845 --> 32:53.638
Here's your sign.

33:01.396 --> 33:04.857
They're drug smugglers.
Heroin. That's all that's in here.

33:17.663 --> 33:26.212
I don't understand.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.754
Get out!

34:13.092 --> 34:16.721
Hello!
Anybody out there?

34:16.804 --> 34:19.681
- Mayday!
- There's no time. Get out now!

34:19.766 --> 34:22.851
- Is someone there?
- Hello!

34:22.936 --> 34:26.813
- Can you hear me?
- Repeat your transmission, please.

34:28.650 --> 34:32.695
Hello! We're survivors of the crash
of Oceanic flight 815.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.406
- Please copy.
- Get out now!

34:35.489 --> 34:37.491
Hello. We're survivors
of flight 815.

35:53.193 --> 35:56.946
So did you know before or after you
asked him about his latest outbreak?

35:57.030 --> 36:00.658
I'd answer that,
but you know,

36:00.742 --> 36:03.118
doctor-patient confidentiality.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.620
Of course.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.250
Thank you for helping him.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.628
I know it was probably
the last thing you wanted to do.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.590
I didn't do it for him.

36:22.389 --> 36:23.514
Help!

36:26.852 --> 36:28.143
No.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.145
Put him down up here.

36:32.357 --> 36:35.359
All right.
That's it.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.570
Okay. Easy.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.491
- What happened?
- There was an accident.

36:42.576 --> 36:46.829
Boone fell off a cliff out near
the place where we were hunting.

36:54.796 --> 36:56.881
Okay, I'm gonna need some water.

36:56.965 --> 37:00.509
Shirts, towels. Anything that I can use
to staunch the bleeding.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.470
Now! Please.

37:07.142 --> 37:10.227
John, tell me exactly what happened.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.606
John?

37:14.774 --> 37:15.816
Locke!

37:41.092 --> 37:43.719
I think what you did was so kind.

37:48.058 --> 37:50.351
- Where's my father?
- Who?

37:50.435 --> 37:52.978
We had the transplant together.

37:54.064 --> 37:56.899
I didn't know he was your father.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.402
We don't have the same last name.

38:01.821 --> 38:05.908
- Where is he?
- Mr. Cooper checked out this afternoon.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.577
He went back home.
He's under private care.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.871
That doesn't make any...

38:14.542 --> 38:17.294
- Did he leave me a message?
- No, not that I know of.

38:17.379 --> 38:20.839
You just relax, Mr. Locke.
I'm gonna get you some juice.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.436
It was his idea.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.153
I'm sorry, John.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.700
What are you doing here?

38:47.784 --> 38:50.744
I needed some money.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.663
He's always been good that way.

38:52.747 --> 38:56.417
You're father's always been generous.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.585
You told me I didn't have a father.

38:59.254 --> 39:02.423
He said that was the only way
you would give it to him.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.591
It had to be your idea.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.928
He told me where to find you.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.222
He asked me to go see you.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.476
I wanted to see you.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.856
This can't be happening.

39:18.940 --> 39:22.067
This is a misunderstanding.

39:22.152 --> 39:24.653
This can't happen to me.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.241
He wouldn't do this to me.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.958
He wouldn't do this to me!

39:58.646 --> 40:02.483
- Eddie, open the gate!
- Mr. Cooper's not seeing guests.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.360
- I'm not a guest.
- I'm sorry, John.

40:13.661 --> 40:16.246
Eddie, open the gate.

40:16.331 --> 40:19.374
I'm sorry. I'm gonna need you
to move your car.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.764
I know you're watching me.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.937
You can't do this.

40:40.021 --> 40:42.231
John, please. Move your car.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.948
I've done everything
you wanted me to do.

41:33.032 --> 41:37.119
So why did you do this to me?
