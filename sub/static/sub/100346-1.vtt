[Chuck] 'Marsha, a lot
of people ask me that.'

00:29.551 --> 00:32.719
A lot of people say,
"Chuck, how can I be like you?"

00:32.720 --> 00:35.221
Well, first thing you gotta do,
you gotta read the book.

00:35.223 --> 00:36.322
You know what I mean?

00:36.324 --> 00:37.791
You gotta read the book,

00:37.793 --> 00:39.626
you gotta listen to the CDs,

00:39.628 --> 00:42.629
you gotta watch the web,
you gotta find out who I am.

00:42.631 --> 00:45.565
You want to be like me?
You gotta think like me.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.700
You gotta act like me.
You gotta breathe like me.

00:47.702 --> 00:48.835
That's what I always say.

00:48.837 --> 00:51.771
And for me,
you know the real secret?

00:51.773 --> 00:55.108
It's be yourself.
Be me, then be yourself.

00:55.110 --> 00:58.311
Cos ultimately, I'm Chuck Knoah,
only I can be Chuck Knoah.

00:58.313 --> 01:00.747
You can be like me,
you can't be me.

01:00.749 --> 01:02.348

He looks alright to me.

in the world.

09:56.351 --> 09:58.951
I want to help people
everywhere.

09:58.953 --> 10:01.988
To have books
on every continent,

10:01.990 --> 10:05.358
so that babies in Sudan
can read my tips on life

10:05.360 --> 10:09.328
and grow up to unlock
their true potential.

10:09.330 --> 10:13.733
That's all I really want
for them, to be their potential.

10:16.204 --> 10:20.373
Well, that sounds
a really important ambition.

the Swiss-dan, like you said.

to be like you, really.

blossom with the right coaching?

in the morning,

going away for a few days?

for you anymore?

nonsense, isn't it?

I'd like to offer you
my deepest gratitude

56:29.508 --> 56:32.175
for choosing to go
on this journey with me.

56:32.177 --> 56:35.612
My task is to guide you
back in time

to the moment
you began your journey

through your mother's
birth canal

56:39.818 --> 56:44.154
and out into the world
for the very first time.

from that time,

56:53.899 --> 56:58.601
allowing them freedom through
your body and your voice.

56:58.603 --> 57:03.807
First we will begin by opening
your body and your voice,

57:03.809 --> 57:06.943
so you do not sustain
any physical injuries

57:06.945 --> 57:13.817
during the process of unlocking
these deep-rooted scars.

57:13.819 --> 57:17.520

find a comfortable position.

Now... close your eyes.

57:40.145 --> 57:41.811
Relax.

57:43.515 --> 57:47.784
And bring your attention
to your breath.

57:48.553 --> 57:50.887
Soften your gaze.

57:52.691 --> 57:56.059
And let the journey re-begin.

57:57.863 --> 57:59.829
And breathing in.

58:01.666 --> 58:03.566
And out.

01:09:10.167 --> 01:09:12.635
Yeah, seriously, it's happening.

01:09:12.636 --> 01:09:15.871
I've got a gun to me right now.
Yeah, I know, crazy, right?

01:09:15.872 --> 01:09:19.707
Well, let's say 70/30 to us?
Hold on, let me see...

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:22.711
He says if we go 60/40, he's in.

01:09:22.712 --> 01:09:25.514
What do you say, we got a deal?

01:09:30.421 --> 01:09:34.523
I'm sorry, Gary, Chuck's going
to have to call you back.

01:09:34.524 --> 01:09:37.960
Nice! Playing hardball,
I like your style...

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:50.272
God, he was even more annoying
in real life.

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:53.274
Yeah. What a letdown.

01:09:54.879 --> 01:09:56.845
[Police siren wailing]

01:09:57.615 --> 01:09:59.515
- [Stabbing]
- Sorry!

01:09:59.517 --> 01:10:01.483
[Val] Fuck!

01:10:16.934 --> 01:10:20.703
[Police siren;
Helicopter approaching]

01:10:37.788 --> 01:10:40.356
Nowhere else to run.

01:10:41.325 --> 01:10:43.425
Why'd you do it, Val?

01:10:43.427 --> 01:10:45.928
We could've just kept on going!

01:10:47.832 --> 01:10:50.332
It was time.

01:11:07.318 --> 01:11:09.618
We're an evolution of people.

01:11:13.291 --> 01:11:15.824
We're the ones
who tell others how to live.

01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:21.330
We're the new gods.
We can't run forever.

01:11:29.473 --> 01:11:31.974
I've had a fantastic time.

01:11:33.978 --> 01:11:35.611
Yeah...

01:11:36.881 --> 01:11:38.514
Me too.

01:11:47.325 --> 01:11:49.358
What're you doing?

01:11:54.432 --> 01:11:56.699
It's time to say goodbye.

01:12:08.045 --> 01:12:09.611
[Stabbing]

01:12:09.613 --> 01:12:11.046
[Groans]

01:12:15.853 --> 01:12:17.720
[Val] Shit!

01:12:24.495 --> 01:12:26.695
[Stabbing; Groaning]

01:12:32.603 --> 01:12:34.570
[Helicopter approaching]

01:12:37.775 --> 01:12:40.676
You're the best
life coach ever, Val.

01:12:41.979 --> 01:12:45.681
Yeah... I know.

01:12:54.158 --> 01:12:56.458
What a journey.

01:13:00.498 --> 01:13:02.698
You can say that again.

01:13:07.037 --> 01:13:08.670
[Police siren]

01:13:12.877 --> 01:13:14.843
[Helicopter overhead]

01:13:16.814 --> 01:13:19.448
[Chuck]
'Visualize the future you want.'

01:13:21.519 --> 01:13:23.619
[Indistinct police radio]

01:13:24.622 --> 01:13:26.588
Where's Val?

01:13:28.626 --> 01:13:31.794
[Chuck] 'Visualize
you becoming that person.

01:13:33.197 --> 01:13:35.063
'Living through them,

01:13:35.065 --> 01:13:38.734
'taking a step in the body
of the new you.'

01:13:41.005 --> 01:13:42.638
[♪ Choir singing]

01:13:54.885 --> 01:13:58.220
'The new, stronger, fitter,

01:13:58.222 --> 01:14:01.457
'wealthier,
more successful you.'

01:14:05.196 --> 01:14:07.496
[♪ Choir voices crescendo]

01:14:28.752 --> 01:14:32.754
The only thing I would say is:
Be true to yourself.

01:14:32.756 --> 01:14:34.490
Love yourself.

01:14:34.492 --> 01:14:38.694
If I can have a little part
in that, in their future lives,

01:14:38.696 --> 01:14:40.128
then that's great.

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:43.765
Because for me, I get joy,
I get love, I get happiness

01:14:43.767 --> 01:14:45.701
out of seeing others succeed.

01:14:45.703 --> 01:14:47.703
For me, that's my journey.

01:14:47.705 --> 01:14:50.038
I'm Chuck, I'm here to help.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:55.077
And if you wanna think of me
as your god, your guru,

01:14:55.079 --> 01:14:56.879
go ahead, that's fine.

01:14:56.881 --> 01:14:59.581
But think about it for a second.

01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:01.149
Wouldn't it be better,

01:15:01.151 --> 01:15:03.652
wouldn't it be
more life-changing,

01:15:03.654 --> 01:15:05.754
if you thought of me
as a friend?

01:15:06.757 --> 01:15:09.024
Read the book, listen to the CD,

01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:11.059
you'll realize I'm your friend,

01:15:11.061 --> 01:15:13.629
I'm your best friend,
I'm here to help you.

01:15:13.631 --> 01:15:17.866
And that's the only way
we can all get what we want.
