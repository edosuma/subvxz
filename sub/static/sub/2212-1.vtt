ls this OK?

02:08.916 --> 02:10.082
Yes, thanks

02:10.125 --> 02:10.914
You're welcome

02:22.916 --> 02:23.707
Hello?

02:23.750 --> 02:25.832
Paul, where are you?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.415
Stuck in traffic. Be right there

02:39.875 --> 02:41.457
Shit!

03:05.500 --> 03:08.124
l wish a cute guy would come to my rescue

03:12.041 --> 03:13.832
Need some help, Miss Yang?

03:13.958 --> 03:15.624
Sure! Thanks!

03:39.916 --> 03:41.874
You look familiar

03:42.500 --> 03:44.415
Cheung Shen Ran?

03:45.416 --> 03:46.749
Your office is nearby?

03:46.916 --> 03:48.082
l'm looking for one

03:48.125 --> 03:49.832
Me too! l'm looking over there

03:50.916 --> 03:52.665
What a coincidence

04:00.791 --> 04:04.707
Hey!

04:08.083 --> 04:09.540
l saw your idol

04:10.791 --> 04:12.040
The Goddess of Stocks

04:12.708 --> 04:13.499
Yang Yang Yang?

04:13.541 --> 04:13.999
Yes

04:14.041 --> 04:14.749
Where?

04:14.833 --> 04:16.707
On the next block,
having trouble parking her Ferrari

04:16.791 --> 04:17.874
Oh boy!

04:18.541 --> 04:20.915
Across the street is Morgan Stanley,

04:21.083 --> 04:24.707
UBS, Goldman Lynch and Merrill Sachs

04:25.083 --> 04:28.082
We face west. South is that way

04:28.125 --> 04:30.749
This building faces south

04:32.041 --> 04:34.957
Morgan Stanley is upstairs.

04:35.125 --> 04:37.165
Goldman Lynch and Merrill Sachs are downstairs

04:38.125 --> 04:39.499
Great location

04:49.250 --> 04:49.874
l'll take it

04:49.916 --> 04:51.207
Thank you, Miss Yang

05:08.541 --> 05:09.457
l'll take it

05:09.500 --> 05:10.707
He'll take it

05:23.958 --> 05:25.165
Stay!

05:25.708 --> 05:27.582
Hold. . .

05:34.958 --> 05:35.957
Hey!

05:36.375 --> 05:37.290
What are you doing?

05:37.666 --> 05:39.332
Hi , Miss Yang!

05:39.625 --> 05:41.540
You're my idol. l want to work for you

05:41.833 --> 05:44.374
l got my master's in finance at Columbia

05:44.416 --> 05:46.290
l was an analyst for Goldman Lynch for 2 years

05:46.333 --> 05:47.124
Then Cheung Shen. . .

05:47.166 --> 05:48.874
That's enough!

05:49.333 --> 05:51.624
Will the market go up or down in a month?

05:52.208 --> 05:52.790
Up

05:52.833 --> 05:53.874
Why?

05:54.208 --> 05:56.540
Positive economic data lead to the tapering of QE

05:56.666 --> 05:59.165
A weak stock market leads to speculating in QE,

05:59.333 --> 06:00.499
V-shape rebound

06:02.250 --> 06:04.624
lf you're wrong, look me up on 1 1 /F

06:05.791 --> 06:07.707
Thanks!

06:28.208 --> 06:31.582
"Cheung Shen Ran, CEO & Fund Manager"

06:34.416 --> 06:37.582
"Chairman of Hong Kong Mountaineering
and Climbing Union"

06:42.416 --> 06:43.874
Where are we going?

06:45.083 --> 06:46.499
l'm sorry

06:49.458 --> 06:51.082
l see

06:51.166 --> 06:52.624
Then l won't bother you

06:52.666 --> 06:53.915
Bye

07:33.791 --> 07:34.915
Sorry

07:42.375 --> 07:43.415
Why?

07:50.916 --> 07:51.915
Does that hurt?

07:51.958 --> 07:52.832
Yes!

07:52.875 --> 07:53.790
Eat more

07:53.958 --> 07:55.707
You need a bigger ass to look nice
in the wedding gown

07:55.750 --> 07:57.207
That's none of your business!

08:03.000 --> 08:04.707
How about French?

08:29.791 --> 08:32.374
Miss Yang, Cheng Zixin is here to see you

08:32.416 --> 08:34.914
Miss Yang, remember that day. . .

08:35.625 --> 08:37.414
You were completely off. When can you start?

08:37.457 --> 08:38.414
Any time

08:38.457 --> 08:39.332
Start now

08:43.125 --> 08:44.374
Morning, Miss Yang

08:44.666 --> 08:45.957
Morning, Boss

08:46.416 --> 08:48.665
Cheng Zixin, Senior Analyst

08:48.958 --> 08:49.499
Sit here

08:49.541 --> 08:50.915
Oh

08:52.750 --> 08:53.499
Come on

08:53.666 --> 08:55.999
Death cross, a second financial crisis-sell

08:56.041 --> 08:58.540
Fiscal cliff, unproductive talks-sell

08:58.833 --> 09:00.540
Greece may go bankrupt-sell

09:03.958 --> 09:06.749
Be greedy when others panic. . .

09:09.708 --> 09:10.957
Buy

09:41.333 --> 09:44.124
Pay attention to related issues,

09:44.625 --> 09:45.874
when European markets open this afternoon

09:49.250 --> 09:50.332
Asshole

09:50.375 --> 09:51.790
No one is panicking

09:53.083 --> 09:54.790
The market will plunge again

09:54.833 --> 09:56.124
Sell

10:03.083 --> 10:04.290
Sit there

10:04.333 --> 10:05.707
OK, Boss

10:14.416 --> 10:15.457
Your handbag

10:15.500 --> 10:17.082
Thanks

10:17.416 --> 10:19.124
Who's Asshole?

10:20.583 --> 10:22.290
Cheung Shen Ran?

10:23.291 --> 10:25.499
He's the Boss's boyfriend

10:30.791 --> 10:34.124
Can you stay on your toes?

10:34.416 --> 10:35.957
ln a volatile market,

10:36.000 --> 10:37.749
l can't save your necks if anything goes wrong

10:37.791 --> 10:40.332
Who's calling?

10:41.083 --> 10:42.624
Hello?

10:42.750 --> 10:45.415
The market crashed, Baby! Make it short!

10:45.666 --> 10:46.582
Look over here

10:46.833 --> 10:48.707
Over where?

10:49.291 --> 10:50.999
Yang Yang Yang's office

10:56.000 --> 10:57.665
After you turned down his proposal,

10:57.708 --> 11:00.165
it took the Boss 30 seconds
to pick up the model downstairs

11:00.291 --> 11:00.832
Ah?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.624
Then he flirted with a
flight attendant on the plane. . .

11:02.708 --> 11:05.499
and got the number of a
news anchor sitting beside him

11:06.666 --> 11:08.207
That's good

11:08.666 --> 11:09.582
What are you doing?

11:09.625 --> 11:11.790
l'm dead if the Boss sees us

11:11.833 --> 11:13.582
Why?

11:13.875 --> 11:15.540
- You're a taboo
- How come?

11:15.583 --> 11:17.957
Mary only mentioned your name. . .

11:18.000 --> 11:20.624
and was fired on the spot. See you

11:20.916 --> 11:22.124
Go somewhere far away

11:22.166 --> 11:23.624
Huh

12:23.875 --> 12:26.082
Oh my god

12:47.250 --> 12:47.874
Hello?

12:47.916 --> 12:50.332
Sorry, something popped up

12:50.875 --> 12:52.290
Next time then

12:52.541 --> 12:54.540
Love you

13:10.666 --> 13:11.582
Where are you going?

13:12.000 --> 13:12.915
Wyndham Street

13:12.958 --> 13:14.457
l'm going to Lan Kwai Fong

13:14.583 --> 13:15.290
Hop in!

13:15.333 --> 13:16.082
Thanks

13:20.375 --> 13:22.707
Boss, may I ask you a question?

13:23.041 --> 13:23.915
Go ahead

13:24.541 --> 13:26.082
Why did you hire me when l was wrong. . .

13:26.125 --> 13:28.540
and not the other way around?

13:29.916 --> 13:31.665
l believe in reverse thinking

13:34.208 --> 13:37.207
You were not exactly wrong; you were"not yet right"

13:53.083 --> 13:53.707
Boss

13:53.750 --> 13:54.332
Shortcut

13:54.375 --> 13:55.332
Wrong way!

14:11.875 --> 14:14.374
Turn the wheel

14:15.208 --> 14:16.207
Turn right. . .

14:16.416 --> 14:18.790
now back. . .

14:21.041 --> 14:22.499
Shit!

14:24.333 --> 14:25.749
l'll do it

15:05.291 --> 15:07.832
l just came home and you're leaving?

15:08.166 --> 15:09.624
Happy hour!

15:10.000 --> 15:12.999
Ceiling lamps are installed at 8.
Won't you take a look?

15:13.375 --> 15:15.749
Design is what I do, not installation

15:16.375 --> 15:17.374
Bye

15:17.791 --> 15:18.582
Hey!

15:18.625 --> 15:21.040
Don't you want to know about
my first day on the job?

15:21.500 --> 15:22.415
How was it?

15:22.625 --> 15:23.957
Swamped! The market crashed

15:24.000 --> 15:24.582
Oh

15:25.416 --> 15:27.124
Guess whom I saw today?

15:27.166 --> 15:27.749
Whom?

15:27.791 --> 15:29.457
Cheung Shen Ran

15:29.500 --> 15:30.415
My ex-Boss

15:30.458 --> 15:31.665
The Asshole?

15:31.750 --> 15:33.082
This is so spooky

15:33.291 --> 15:36.332
He moved his company right opposite mine

15:37.666 --> 15:39.249
Your story is "to be continued"?

15:39.666 --> 15:42.915
Nonsense! Get lost

16:42.916 --> 16:44.332
Need any help?

16:45.625 --> 16:46.957
OK, thanks

16:50.958 --> 16:52.499
l move your car,

16:52.708 --> 16:54.332
you buy me dinner

17:06.750 --> 17:08.457
The way you drive. . .

17:09.083 --> 17:10.499
You came back from Europe?

17:10.540 --> 17:11.790
Nice, France

17:12.333 --> 17:13.415
What a coincidence

17:13.458 --> 17:15.124
l lived in Nice for 6 months

17:15.165 --> 17:16.249
They have great seafood

17:16.290 --> 17:17.790
Let's have seafood then

17:18.083 --> 17:19.915
Tung Kee Restaurant in Sai Kung, OK?

17:20.540 --> 17:21.582
OK

17:28.040 --> 17:30.207
Busquets's pass is intercepted !

17:30.791 --> 17:31.874
The French fight back

17:32.291 --> 17:35.957
Ribmry gets the ball and runs past Alonso,
past Ramos and Nasri!

17:36.250 --> 17:36.957
He sent a pass and, ah, yet another goal!

17:37.000 --> 17:39.415
Benzema scored yet another goal for France!

17:39.458 --> 17:41.124
1 7 minutes into the game! 4-0!

17:41.166 --> 17:43.249
4 goals is a piece of cake!

17:43.375 --> 17:47.957
(Marseillaise)

18:03.291 --> 18:04.290
He must have placed a big bet

18:04.333 --> 18:06.415
Have l seen you before?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.915
ln your dream?

18:18.750 --> 18:20.957
Why are men so obsessed with boobs?

18:21.458 --> 18:22.624
No!

18:22.666 --> 18:26.040
That octopus has been waving at me all night

18:28.250 --> 18:30.124
Are you drunk?

18:30.208 --> 18:32.915
lt's true! Whenever Spain loses a goal,

18:32.958 --> 18:37.374
the octopus starts waving SOS

18:54.375 --> 18:55.957
S

18:59.625 --> 19:01.332
O

19:04.833 --> 19:06.415
S

19:24.750 --> 19:25.957
No way

19:26.291 --> 19:28.415
You told people to bet on Spain?

19:29.250 --> 19:32.040
l lost $1 00K because of you!
Half sashimi , half deep-fried

19:32.083 --> 19:32.707
Got it

19:32.875 --> 19:34.249
You can't eat that!

19:34.333 --> 19:35.790
Why not?

19:36.125 --> 19:37.415
l'll pay for it, how much?

19:37.458 --> 19:38.749
l have plenty of money!

19:39.333 --> 19:40.124
Oh boy

19:59.416 --> 20:01.540
Hey. . .

20:04.625 --> 20:08.290
She took the octopus!

20:08.416 --> 20:10.582
That's my octopus, bitch!

20:10.791 --> 20:11.999
Octopus!

21:11.125 --> 21:12.707
Asshole!

21:14.916 --> 21:18.457
She was brushing against your leg with hers!

21:19.041 --> 21:20.499
Just like a windshield wiper

21:20.541 --> 21:21.624
What can I do?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.582
Slap you and tell you off?

21:27.166 --> 21:28.665
Then we're finished

21:30.500 --> 21:34.915
Serve me right for wanting
to be your last girlfriend

21:36.500 --> 21:40.332
l want to be your last girlfriend

22:56.250 --> 22:58.790
Hello!

22:59.041 --> 23:00.457
Did Cheung Shen Ran see you?

23:00.625 --> 23:02.874
No, he's too busy. . .

23:03.291 --> 23:04.624
flirting with my Boss,

23:04.666 --> 23:06.790
doing magic tricks upstairs,

23:07.375 --> 23:09.165
and using Post-lts downstairs

23:22.166 --> 23:23.165
John said. . .

23:23.375 --> 23:25.665
he had picked up a model right after
l had turned him down . . .

23:26.000 --> 23:29.040
and had hooked up with a flight attendant
and a news anchor on the plane

23:29.375 --> 23:31.707
A colleague was fired for saying my name

23:32.291 --> 23:33.874
That was too much!

23:35.333 --> 23:37.124
You're the best

23:38.500 --> 23:39.707
So are you

23:40.041 --> 23:41.665
Keep up the good work, night

23:41.708 --> 23:42.582
You too

23:42.666 --> 23:43.624
Good night

23:46.708 --> 23:50.624
"l forgot how it got started"

23:50.791 --> 23:54.165
"Maybe l just have. . ."

23:54.333 --> 23:57.957
"this feeling towards you"

24:00.666 --> 24:03.999
"Suddenly l realized . . ."

24:04.833 --> 24:08.249
"l've deeply fallen in love with you"

24:08.416 --> 24:11.582
"lt's very simple"

24:14.625 --> 24:20.624
"l don't care if my love
takes me to utter darkness"

24:21.333 --> 24:26.957
"l can no longer tell right from wrong"

24:28.416 --> 24:34.165
"l don't regret following you day
and night out of love"

24:35.458 --> 24:40.124
"l'm the crazy one"

24:47.166 --> 24:48.624
Please wait!

24:56.916 --> 24:57.999
Going up!

25:04.291 --> 25:05.915
Please take the next one, sir!

25:05.958 --> 25:06.707

Excuse me. . .

Sorry. . . please press 1 1 /F, thanks!

25:13.666 --> 25:14.957
Thanks a lot

25:23.250 --> 25:26.332
Excuse me, thanks

25:29.458 --> 25:30.790
Shh . . .

25:32.375 --> 25:32.832
Mr. Cheung

25:32.916 --> 25:42.457
Morning

26:20.166 --> 26:22.165
What a coincidence, Mr. Cheung

26:26.625 --> 26:28.290
What a coincidence, Shen Ran

26:30.583 --> 26:33.374
What a coincidence, Asshole

26:41.000 --> 26:41.915
Hi ,

26:42.083 --> 26:43.790
what a coincidence, Cheung Shen Ran

27:29.500 --> 27:32.332
Cheung Shen Ran

27:32.583 --> 27:34.374
Asshole

27:48.958 --> 27:50.624
Bonjour

51:17.791 --> 51:19.165
French cuisine

52:00.833 --> 52:03.290
Nice car! See you in Central

52:25.750 --> 52:26.624
Hello?

52:26.666 --> 52:27.540
Yang Yang Yang

52:27.583 --> 52:28.499
Why didn't you come home?

52:28.541 --> 52:30.915
lf it's urgent, leave a message after the beep

52:30.958 --> 52:31.415
Beep

52:34.708 --> 52:35.499
Let's do dinner tonight

52:35.541 --> 52:37.165
We have something important to discuss

52:38.291 --> 52:39.665
OK!

52:52.458 --> 52:53.082
Hello?

52:53.125 --> 52:54.249
Has it ever occurred to you . . .

52:54.500 --> 52:55.957
that Ferrari doesn't suit you?

52:57.416 --> 53:00.082
No, l like it precisely because it's hard to drive

53:01.333 --> 53:02.915
See you in Central

53:24.583 --> 53:26.207
You owe me a French meal

53:26.500 --> 53:27.582
2 months ago,

53:27.708 --> 53:29.332
you were having trouble
parking your car over there

53:29.541 --> 53:30.999
l came over to help,

53:31.125 --> 53:33.040
but another guy beat me to it

53:33.541 --> 53:34.582
No big deal

53:34.875 --> 53:36.165
l'll make you my girlfriend

53:40.125 --> 53:41.499
Good luck!

54:04.583 --> 54:05.915
Mr. Cheung!

54:10.416 --> 54:11.040
l'll do it

54:11.083 --> 54:11.999
Sure!

54:13.458 --> 54:14.499
Thank you

54:18.625 --> 54:20.999
Mr. Cheung, your wine has been decanted

54:21.041 --> 54:21.832
Here. . .

54:33.708 --> 54:34.915
You wanted to talk?

54:37.416 --> 54:38.624
Let's eat first

54:47.250 --> 54:48.165
Can you tell me now?

54:49.583 --> 54:50.915
Let's do that over dessert

55:06.041 --> 55:07.082
A year ago,

55:07.625 --> 55:08.790
right here at this table,

55:09.458 --> 55:11.790
a woman asked me if l could be her Martian

55:12.458 --> 55:13.790
l was about to say yes,

55:14.416 --> 55:16.540
when 3 women with boops hanging out walked by

55:16.833 --> 55:18.165
Naturally your nose started to bleed

55:20.708 --> 55:22.499
Yes and she chose the Martian

55:22.791 --> 55:25.082
Marry me, Cheng Zixin!

55:25.125 --> 55:26.790
Don't return my ring

55:30.333 --> 55:32.582
The Martian even designed a building for her

55:37.791 --> 55:40.290
l fought for her but failed

55:42.791 --> 55:44.249
l thought l'd be fine back on Earth

55:48.416 --> 55:51.790
But I wanted to die and
couldn't sleep a wink at night

55:57.583 --> 56:00.957
Then somehow I ended up outside her apartment

56:41.250 --> 56:42.290
Mr. Chen,

56:42.333 --> 56:43.665
l want to rent 4B

56:43.791 --> 56:45.790
Do you know what time it is? You're sick!

56:47.750 --> 56:51.124
Mr. Chen, l want to rent 4B

57:09.083 --> 57:10.707
l couldn't fall asleep elsewhere

57:11.666 --> 57:13.082
You're really sick!

57:14.916 --> 57:16.332
Last night,

57:17.250 --> 57:18.790
when you took off with the designer,

57:22.041 --> 57:23.665
l couldn't breathe again

57:24.916 --> 57:26.332
l was really scared

57:28.750 --> 57:30.249
l knew that I was crazy about you

57:32.208 --> 57:34.165
So l went out this morning. . .

57:35.208 --> 57:36.582
to buy you something

57:55.250 --> 57:56.790
Be my last girlfriend

57:57.541 --> 57:58.665
Marry me

58:23.541 --> 58:27.249
Can l stay at your place until our wedding?

58:34.333 --> 58:36.082
She picked that apartment

58:37.041 --> 58:38.540
l wanted to move out,

58:39.625 --> 58:41.249
but couln't let it go

58:43.250 --> 58:44.832
Terminate the lease for me

58:55.750 --> 58:57.499
OK, l'll take care of it

59:08.666 --> 59:10.999
Get rid of the furniture as well

59:11.458 --> 59:13.582
OK, l'll do that

59:20.333 --> 59:22.374
And the Maserati

59:31.000 --> 59:33.165
Drive my Ferrari for now

59:47.166 --> 59:48.999
What about Mr. Chen's apartment?

01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:06.040
4B, No. 4 Square Street

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:19.415
lf you love her so much,

01:00:19.875 --> 01:00:21.790
why didn't you get her back?

01:00:25.958 --> 01:00:27.874
She's married to the Martian

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.832
Even if I get her back,

01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:33.332
l'm not sure I can make her happy

01:00:34.958 --> 01:00:36.499
Martian?

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:41.124
There're two kinds of men: those who cheat,

01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:42.832
and those who want to

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:46.457
But he's neither

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:18.249
You like those?

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:21.915
They give me the feeling of home

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:25.165
Good! Any plans for tonight?

01:01:25.541 --> 01:01:26.832
Wedding dress fitting at 8

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:29.040
OK, let's go

01:01:29.416 --> 01:01:30.707
What?

01:01:34.666 --> 01:01:35.999
The feeling of home

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.624
Cheung Shen Ran wants to
get rid of everything in here

01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:40.457
Take anything you like

01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:43.165
We'll replace everything when we get married

01:01:46.208 --> 01:01:47.624
Why don't you congratulate me?

01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:49.499
Try the sofa

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:53.040
You're not mad at him anymore?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.832
His playboy image is just a facade

01:01:56.041 --> 01:01:57.832
The apartment and all the furniture. . .

01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.290
were his ex's idea

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.457
After she turned down his proposal,

01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:04.124
he wanted to die staring at all this

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:05.874
Who would have guessed?

01:02:06.416 --> 01:02:08.165
lt's great to marry him

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.790
This sofa is so cozy

01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:12.540
The feeling of home

01:02:12.791 --> 01:02:14.999
Forget it. lt's the wrong size

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:17.124
Thanks anyway

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:18.374
l'm late for my fitting

01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:19.582
Please look again

01:02:19.625 --> 01:02:21.374
No, it's almost 8

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:24.040
Alright. . . l'll give you a lift

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.040
Not even one?

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.332
Right on time!

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.124
Thanks so much

01:02:36.291 --> 01:02:37.624
Since you won't take the furniture,

01:02:37.791 --> 01:02:39.790
what about the car? She picked that too

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:40.957
No, thanks

01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:42.207
What about your husband?

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:44.040
He doesn't like sports cars

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:46.332
A man who doesn't like sports cars?

01:02:46.375 --> 01:02:47.707
What kind of a man is he?

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:49.290
He's a Martian

01:02:49.958 --> 01:02:50.957
See you

01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:54.290
Bye!

01:03:05.958 --> 01:03:06.915
What's up?

01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:09.499
Paul, can you have dinner with me tonight?

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.457
Sorry, I have a date

01:03:21.708 --> 01:03:24.707
"Back from Nice. See you at the pier?"

01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:28.707
The Martian?

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.415
You really can't?

01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:39.082
"OK!"

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:46.457
OK, l'll come back for you later

01:03:46.916 --> 01:03:47.874
After your fitting,

01:03:47.916 --> 01:03:49.624
wait for me at lnagiku, alright?

01:04:04.916 --> 01:04:05.874
My sister. . .

01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:06.874
needed to talk to me

01:04:07.041 --> 01:04:08.374
Wait for me on the boat

01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:10.915
This is for you

01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:13.082
The University of Nice. . .

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.707
has a lot of fig trees

01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:16.415
l picked them just for you

01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:19.082
Turn around

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:22.499
Asshole!

01:04:26.333 --> 01:04:27.832
What's wrong?

01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:37.040
Why so late?

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:38.499
l was exacting justice

01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:43.749
Hello, Mr. Chen?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.540
Yes, hold on a second

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.582
Yes, tell me the number

01:04:59.708 --> 01:05:01.124
Who are you looking for?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.499
l'm sorry

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.790
Wrong address

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.499
OK, thanks, bye!

01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:23.957
Who was it?

01:05:24.208 --> 01:05:25.290
Wrong address

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.665
Mr. Chen said you can
return the keys tomorrow night

01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:28.290
So soon?

01:05:28.333 --> 01:05:31.332
Yes, the Happy Valley developer will take
the apartment back the day after tomorrow

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:33.165
The furniture was given away

01:05:33.208 --> 01:05:35.249
You can trade in your Maserati for a new one

01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:37.415
Am I efficient or what?

01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:45.790
Are you alright?

01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:48.915
She settled for the Ferrari

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.582
Ferrari?

01:05:50.625 --> 01:05:53.707
l'm a Mini Cooper up against a Ferrari

01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:56.040
Forgot to tell you,

01:05:56.375 --> 01:05:58.207
l have fallen in love with your Boss

01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:01.290
She's getting married

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:02.624
With the Ferrari?

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.249
With Cheung Shen Ran

01:06:04.791 --> 01:06:06.332
Ferrari is Cheung Shen Ran?

01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:08.040
The hell with the Ferrari!

01:06:08.291 --> 01:06:10.124
She's going to marry her boyfriend Cheung Shen Ran

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:12.415
and yet she just told me he's not over me yet, OK?

01:06:12.666 --> 01:06:13.665
Sake!

01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:15.040
Half a dozen

01:06:15.166 --> 01:06:16.415
OK!

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:28.665
Fucking asshole!

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.249
Hello?

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:43.832
Where are you?

01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:47.874
l couldn't sleep, so l went for a spin

01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:51.540
OK, enjoy your ride

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:52.624
Bye

01:07:10.291 --> 01:07:10.999
l want to drink

01:07:11.041 --> 01:07:12.624
You had enough! Now sit down!

01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:14.790
Sit over here

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.874
Sit here

01:07:17.541 --> 01:07:19.999
Look at your cell phone and guess the song

01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:27.124
Qihong!

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.457
Oh boy

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.332
What's going on?

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:31.082
Paul drank too much

01:07:31.125 --> 01:07:33.624
Come on, give it to me

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:49.957
Drink yogurt

01:07:51.291 --> 01:07:52.707
Paul was dumped

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:54.290
By who?

01:07:54.458 --> 01:07:55.457
My Boss

01:07:56.708 --> 01:07:58.582
lsn't she with Cheung Shen Ran?

01:07:58.916 --> 01:08:00.499
Exactly!

01:08:01.708 --> 01:08:02.915
l want to drink this

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:06.665
You'll throw up if you keep drinking

01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:19.957
4A or 4B?

01:08:25.875 --> 01:08:27.874
No, l just want to pee

01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:30.124
Do whatever you like!

01:08:30.166 --> 01:08:31.749
As long as you don't drink

01:08:45.957 --> 01:08:47.124
Boss!

01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:49.124
Cheng Zixin? What are you doing here?

01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:50.665
l live here

01:08:51.166 --> 01:08:52.874
l thought you live on Wyndham Street

01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:56.165
lt's under renovation

01:08:56.207 --> 01:08:58.249
This is just temporary

01:08:58.457 --> 01:09:00.332
What a coincidence

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:16.415
"Following you day and night out of love"

01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:22.457
"l'm the crazy one"

01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:27.290
"l love you"

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:42.915
You've been living here?

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:46.124
Not really

01:09:46.375 --> 01:09:48.457
Actually l used to live. . .

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.874
over there

01:09:58.291 --> 01:09:59.874
Zixin!

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.207
Good night!

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:09.499
This. . .

01:10:10.666 --> 01:10:12.624
l know the answer!

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:27.207
"l love you. Yes I do"

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.624
"l'll never give up"

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:34.915
"the right to love you"

01:10:36.541 --> 01:10:42.874
"lf you still have some doubts,"

01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:48.082
"listen to my heart"

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:50.540
"Listen to me saying I love you"

01:10:50.916 --> 01:10:54.124
"Would you marry me?"

01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:57.707
"Yes l do"

01:10:57.916 --> 01:10:58.790
What happened?

01:10:59.166 --> 01:11:00.707
My Boss came over

01:11:01.208 --> 01:11:03.707
For you or your brother?

01:11:05.125 --> 01:11:07.124
l think she was looking for Cheung Shen Ran

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.874
ln your apartment?

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:16.457
Hold on

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:55.624
He's next door

01:11:55.875 --> 01:11:57.082
Next door?

01:11:57.333 --> 01:11:58.665
He. . .

01:11:58.958 --> 01:12:02.082
He must have rented my old apartment

01:12:20.583 --> 01:12:21.874
Qihong,

01:12:21.916 --> 01:12:24.207
l'm feeling tired

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:25.957
l'm going to bed now

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.290
Oh

01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:29.665
OK, good night

01:12:29.958 --> 01:12:31.165
Good night

01:13:56.375 --> 01:13:57.624
This is goodbye,

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:00.249
Cheng Zixin

01:14:13.083 --> 01:14:14.624
Why are you here?

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:17.665
Cheng Zixin!

01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:21.957
l live here

01:14:26.666 --> 01:14:28.624
Why do you live here?

01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:36.707
l wanted to rent back my apartment,

01:14:42.208 --> 01:14:44.457
but the landlord said it was taken

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.207
He asked me. . .

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:48.957
if I wanted this apartment

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.624
He said he also owned the apartment next door

01:14:56.541 --> 01:14:57.999
l'm going to work

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:34.874
"Qihong: Morning!"

01:15:59.791 --> 01:16:00.957
My stop

01:16:14.791 --> 01:16:18.707
"Qihong: Morning!"

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.124
Yang Yang Yang

01:16:44.041 --> 01:16:45.499
Cheng Zixin

01:17:11.666 --> 01:17:15.207
Yeah, l told you it was
V-shape rebound , golden ratio

01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:18.332
V-shape rebound , golden ratio. . .

01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:22.665
lt's booming!

01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:24.457
Boss, it's booming!

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.082
Morning, Mr. Cheung

01:17:26.291 --> 01:17:28.207
Boss, what a miraculous day

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:29.415
Miraculous day

01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:30.332
Morning, Mr. Cheung

01:17:30.458 --> 01:17:32.749
lt's so amazing

01:17:32.791 --> 01:17:35.749
Who would have guessed it's so amazing

01:17:58.458 --> 01:17:58.999
Hello?

01:17:59.166 --> 01:18:00.165
What's with the keys?

01:18:00.541 --> 01:18:02.207
The developer won't terminate the lease

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:04.874
The furniture is too big for my colleague

01:18:05.375 --> 01:18:07.124
The dealer won't let you trade in

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:08.749
You can keep them all

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:12.957
What about the ring?

01:18:13.583 --> 01:18:15.124
l was at 4B last night

01:18:20.416 --> 01:18:21.915
lt's over

01:18:22.833 --> 01:18:24.290
lt was the last night

01:18:26.541 --> 01:18:28.290
You chose me?

01:18:30.375 --> 01:18:31.499
Yes!

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:33.332
Did you guess the song?

01:18:36.708 --> 01:18:37.374
l'm still working on it

01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:39.790
How many times did you
try to guess Cheng Zixin's song?

01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:44.457
How many times have you watched my video?

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:46.499
The designer said when I was drunk,

01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:48.415
l kept saying l wanted to be your last girlfriend

01:18:48.541 --> 01:18:49.707
You're in love with the designer?

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:51.582
l kicked him into the ocean last night

01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:53.374
Turns out he's the Martian,

01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:55.332
Cheng Zixin's fiancm

01:19:10.541 --> 01:19:11.915
Why are you late?

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.082
l want to resign

01:19:16.875 --> 01:19:18.082
Something wrong with your colleagues?

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:18.790
No!

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:19.915
With the office?

01:19:19.958 --> 01:19:20.624
No!

01:19:21.083 --> 01:19:21.957
With me?

01:19:22.166 --> 01:19:22.999
No!

01:19:23.583 --> 01:19:24.915
Be professional!

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.582
Miss Yang, we're ready for the meeting

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:32.082
Stay here and think it over

01:19:51.916 --> 01:19:55.290
The number you have dialed is not registered

01:19:59.000 --> 01:19:59.540
Use your brain!

01:19:59.583 --> 01:20:00.707
Cheng Zixin's number?

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:01.707
Give it a rest!

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:02.915
What's her number?

01:20:02.958 --> 01:20:04.499
Later. . .

01:20:04.708 --> 01:20:05.707
Tell me!

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.707
"John"

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.499
Get lost!

01:21:26.291 --> 01:21:27.124
Open the door!

01:21:27.166 --> 01:21:28.249
Hey, sir!

01:21:55.083 --> 01:21:56.457
Mr. Cheung

01:22:12.416 --> 01:22:14.874
"Resignation"

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:37.290
Keep working

01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:57.499
"Suzhou"

01:23:01.208 --> 01:23:04.374
We're on schedule. Block A has been completed

01:23:04.666 --> 01:23:06.374
OK, you can return to the office

01:23:06.541 --> 01:23:07.457
OK!

01:23:07.625 --> 01:23:08.540
Thanks

01:23:12.375 --> 01:23:14.749
"Bumped into Cheung Shen Ran. A bit scary"

01:23:25.458 --> 01:23:26.124
Hello?

01:23:26.166 --> 01:23:27.415
ls Zixin back yet?

01:23:27.458 --> 01:23:29.165
She's not at work?

01:23:30.333 --> 01:23:31.499
Here she is

01:23:32.666 --> 01:23:33.957
Qihong!

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.374
Hello?

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.665
Are you alright?

01:23:38.166 --> 01:23:39.540
l just resigned

01:23:47.791 --> 01:23:49.165
Cheng Zixin!

01:23:49.666 --> 01:23:51.040
Open the door, Cheng Zixin!

01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:54.124
l'll call you back

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:05.582
Hello?

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:06.832
ls it Cheung Shen Ran?

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.290
He seems to have gone mad

01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:11.707
Open the door, Cheng Zixin

01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:17.790
You asked me. . .

01:24:18.375 --> 01:24:20.332
if I would screw around after we got married

01:24:21.916 --> 01:24:23.165
My answer was:

01:24:23.208 --> 01:24:24.749
"l'll try not to"

01:24:28.208 --> 01:24:29.749
Now my answer is:

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:32.707
"l won't"

01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:38.665
That's none of my business

01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:05.415
Qihong!

01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:06.582
l'm coming back to Hong Kong now

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:08.415
No, l'm coming back to Suzhou

01:25:10.833 --> 01:25:11.540
"Passport"

01:25:27.666 --> 01:25:29.249
Cheng Zixin!

01:25:38.375 --> 01:25:39.915
Where's Cheng Zixin?

01:25:42.041 --> 01:25:43.040
Cheng Zixin!

01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:45.457
Cheung Shen Ran, stop harassing my wife!

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:48.540
Fang Qihong, stop harassing Yang Yang Yang!

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:55.999
Suzhou

01:25:56.041 --> 01:25:57.915
What about Qihong and Yang Yang?

01:26:01.416 --> 01:26:03.207
You weren't at the wrong address either

01:26:07.208 --> 01:26:07.790
Hello?

01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:09.582
Ask him what about me and Yang Yang Yang?

01:26:09.875 --> 01:26:11.415
What about you and Yang Yang?

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:12.915
Ask Cheung Shen Ran!

01:26:12.958 --> 01:26:14.124
He's gone

01:26:27.041 --> 01:26:28.332
"Zixin's address?"

01:26:28.375 --> 01:26:29.749
"New address: 9B, Block D, Wutong New Town"

01:26:39.916 --> 01:26:41.582
How are you?

01:26:43.458 --> 01:26:45.457
l don't know why you kicked me into the ocean. . .

01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:48.457
and what's between you and Qihong

01:26:48.666 --> 01:26:50.624
l only know l love you

01:26:54.041 --> 01:26:55.624

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.874
l'll probably send this to your wife

01:27:00.708 --> 01:27:02.415
l don't have a wife

01:27:05.041 --> 01:27:05.999
Say it again!

01:27:06.041 --> 01:27:07.415
l don't have a wife

01:27:07.458 --> 01:27:09.124
l'm definitely sending this to your wife

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:11.165
ls there any misunderstanding?

01:27:22.833 --> 01:27:23.957
Where's Cheng Zixin?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:24.957
You can talk to me

01:27:25.125 --> 01:27:26.124
Talk to Yang Yang Yang

01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:27.290
About what?

01:27:27.458 --> 01:27:28.457
Cheng Zixin

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.207
What about me and her?

01:27:30.625 --> 01:27:31.582
Don't play dumb!

01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:32.999
What are you doing, Cheung Shen Ran?

01:27:33.166 --> 01:27:34.790
Qihong, don't fight!

01:27:36.458 --> 01:27:37.249
The Martian?

01:27:37.291 --> 01:27:39.665
You already have Cheng Zixin,
why fool around with Yang Yang Yang?

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:41.624
Stop it!

01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:52.082
Stop it. . .

01:27:52.208 --> 01:27:53.874
Who exactly is Yang Yang Yang?

01:27:53.916 --> 01:27:56.582
Fight until you settle this

01:27:58.666 --> 01:28:00.249
Yang Yang Yang. . .

01:28:00.458 --> 01:28:01.290
Boss!

01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:02.790
l just sent you a video

01:28:07.166 --> 01:28:08.207
Say it again

01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:09.499
l don't have a wife

01:28:09.875 --> 01:28:11.499
l'm definitely sending this to your wife

01:28:14.666 --> 01:28:15.290
Hello?

01:28:15.333 --> 01:28:16.790
Now you know your husband's true colors

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:18.999
He's my brother, not my husband

01:28:25.583 --> 01:28:27.915
Yang Yang Yang mistook my brother for Qihong

01:28:28.416 --> 01:28:29.915
lt's Yang Yang Yang

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.082
Hello?

01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:35.290

01:28:35.875 --> 01:28:37.207
You didn't hit anyone, did you?

01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:38.707
l did

01:28:39.041 --> 01:28:40.999
l also took a good kick

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:48.624
Shit!

01:28:52.583 --> 01:28:56.124
Genie!

01:29:06.583 --> 01:29:07.874
l'm sorry!

01:29:11.583 --> 01:29:13.374
Sorry!

01:29:15.958 --> 01:29:17.749
l'll get the first-aid kit

01:29:18.541 --> 01:29:19.457
Paul,

l finally know about Yang Yang Yang and me

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:24.290
What is it?

01:29:24.666 --> 01:29:27.582
She mistook you for me

01:29:42.291 --> 01:29:43.749
l'm sorry!

01:29:45.166 --> 01:29:46.499
l'm fine

01:29:47.125 --> 01:29:48.665
l'm glad we cleared that up

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.165
You were wrong about me

01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:24.124
l know

01:30:24.166 --> 01:30:25.832
Genie's dying!

01:30:55.458 --> 01:30:57.165
Being trapped inside a fish tank. . .

01:30:57.708 --> 01:30:59.040
is unbearable for Genie

01:30:59.458 --> 01:31:01.207
Just let it go

01:31:23.833 --> 01:31:25.374
Rest in peace!

01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:35.749
Genie, don't sleep!

01:31:36.125 --> 01:31:39.165
FC Barcelona's playing Real Madrid tonight.
Let's watch it together

01:31:39.375 --> 01:31:41.207

Murray vs. Djokovic later,

and the Manchester derby. Don't sleep!

01:31:46.791 --> 01:31:50.582
Carpe diem. Let's watch the games together

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:11.624
Paul!

01:32:24.083 --> 01:32:27.415
Shit!

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:29.040
Here goes nothing!

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.749
l'll give anything just to bring Paul back

01:33:07.458 --> 01:33:08.874
Genie's alive

01:33:09.458 --> 01:33:10.415
Genie,

01:33:10.666 --> 01:33:12.665
don't give up! Hang in there!

01:33:12.958 --> 01:33:14.165
We love you!

01:33:14.208 --> 01:33:15.582
We'll watch ball games together

01:33:15.625 --> 01:33:17.290
FC Barcelona, Real Madrid . . .

01:33:17.541 --> 01:33:18.707
Messi , Cristiano Ronaldo. . .

Federer, Nadal. . .

ls 2368 worth buying?

01:33:26.375 --> 01:33:29.582
Where to set the stop-loss and stop profit?

01:34:03.583 --> 01:34:04.957
Mom, look!
