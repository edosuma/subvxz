She never wore dresses.

And when I asked my mom
why she didn't have kids,

23:20.859 --> 23:24.029
she just said,
"De eso no se habla."

from a very young age,

23:28.867 --> 23:31.870
I was taught that being gay
was shameful.

I wish I could just snap my fingers
and be a perfect mother for you.

23:58.647 --> 24:00.482
But for now, I will say this...

The next time Benji

24:03.443 --> 24:06.405

you were okay.
