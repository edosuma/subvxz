WEBVTT

00:10.963 --> 00:12.063
Surrender!

00:13.245 --> 00:15.700
Ok, you heard him people.
Everyone stand down.

00:15.730 --> 00:17.960
Cap, give him the
keys to the Quinjet.

00:18.135 --> 00:19.427
You're not serious?

00:19.457 --> 00:20.767
Not even close.

00:20.797 --> 00:23.337
Because we're not surrendering
to the serpent society.

00:23.367 --> 00:24.801
Avengers, pick a target.

00:24.831 --> 00:25.989
On my mark.

00:31.230 --> 00:32.369
<i>Tony, wait!</i>

00:32.520 --> 00:34.182
Everyone, just breath.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.488
<i>We can resolve this without resorting
to violence, no one needs to get hurt.</i>

00:37.518 --> 00:40.003
Cobra was one of my
patients in the big house.

00:40.033 --> 00:41.510
Most of the Society was.

00:41.904 --> 00:43.683
Let me talk to them, Tony.

00:43.713 --> 00:45.882
Hank, move out of the way, now.

00:46.381 --> 00:47.481
Cobra, Klaus...

00:47.635 --> 00:49.079
Why don't you let the hostages go?

00:49.109 --> 00:50.947
You and I, we can talk this out.

00:51.146 --> 00:52.509
No one has to get hurt.

00:52.539 --> 00:54.905
We can work together
and everyone can win.

00:54.935 --> 00:57.934
Win? You have already lost, Avengers!

00:58.145 --> 01:02.285
Madame Viper is meeting us here
with the full power of HYDRA at our back.

01:02.315 --> 01:05.221
You think he means the same Madame
Viper that's in a SHIELD lockup?

01:05.251 --> 01:07.002
and the same HYDRA we just took down?

01:07.032 --> 01:10.340
Yeah, sorry Cobra, I am pretty sure
you are on your own here.

01:10.928 --> 01:13.327
You're wrong! The message... It was...

01:13.357 --> 01:14.826
Hank, move!

01:14.995 --> 01:17.447
For real, Hank. You have
to get out of the way.

01:17.696 --> 01:20.698
Klaus, please let this people go.
Take me instead.

01:20.728 --> 01:22.242
We can work this out.

01:22.272 --> 01:25.596
No! You're lying! You are all lying!

01:32.749 --> 01:35.384
Serpent Society, attack!

01:38.385 --> 01:41.385

02:42.988 --> 02:44.820
Take it easy Clint,
you got hit pretty hard.

02:44.850 --> 02:46.470
Yeah'... You're welcome.

02:46.947 --> 02:49.797
Quit messing around and
help take these guys out.

03:38.797 --> 03:39.797
I've got him.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.262
That could have gone better, team.

03:58.292 --> 03:59.492
No kidding.

04:00.218 --> 04:01.610
Ah, what were you thinking, Hank?

04:01.640 --> 04:03.868
We're trying to take the
Serpent Society down,

04:03.898 --> 04:05.953
not have Sunday tea.

04:06.954 --> 04:08.801
Hawkeye got hurt
because of you, Hank.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.045
I mean seriously...

04:10.075 --> 04:12.355
They're super villains, you just hit them.

04:12.803 --> 04:14.899
Wasp and Iron Man, speak truly.

04:14.929 --> 04:17.552
Animals like these, they cannot
be talked to.

04:17.582 --> 04:19.391
They respond only to violence.

04:21.862 --> 04:22.912
I quit.

04:33.728 --> 04:35.278
<i>I just can't do it anymore.</i>

04:35.468 --> 04:38.216
I never wanted this.
Life of violence...

04:38.246 --> 04:40.153
fighting day in and day out.

04:41.507 --> 04:43.394
There has to be a
better solution than this.

04:43.772 --> 04:47.851
Humanity has come so far, but more and
more it seems like we're failing as a species.

04:47.881 --> 04:49.760
Like we're wasting all of our promise.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.393
<i>Humanity is inherently flawed.</i>

04:52.423 --> 04:55.568
<i>Observation and analysis, suggests
that humanity is encoded with</i>

04:55.598 --> 04:57.800
<i>chaotic and violent tendencies.</i>

04:57.830 --> 04:59.546
<i>that cannot be overcome.</i>

04:59.576 --> 05:01.004
You might be right, Ultron.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.806
This isn't exactly the peace and order that
I programmed you to try and achieve is it?

05:07.128 --> 05:08.128
<i>No.</i>

05:08.256 --> 05:09.506
<i>It is not.</i>

05:10.135 --> 05:12.678
Just let her look at you
Hawkeye, she's a Paramedic.

05:12.708 --> 05:13.794
It's Thor's friend.

05:13.824 --> 05:14.824
<i>I'm fine!</i>

05:15.041 --> 05:16.849
Cap, knock him out if you have to.

05:16.879 --> 05:18.431
Or even if you just want to.

05:18.461 --> 05:19.461
<i>Understood.</i>

05:19.961 --> 05:22.993
Hawkeye possess the spirit
of a true warrior.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.286
Yeah, he's something.

05:24.316 --> 05:26.790
JARVIS, bring me up everything you
got on the Serpent Society.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.085
<i>Very well, sir.</i>

05:28.115 --> 05:29.975
Hey, can we get back to Hank please?

05:30.005 --> 05:32.055
We're not just going to
let him quit are we?

05:32.567 --> 05:33.860
What do you want me to do?

05:33.890 --> 05:36.009
He's an adult,
we can't force him to stay.

05:36.039 --> 05:37.213
Sure we can!

05:37.243 --> 05:39.064
He's a founding member of the team.

05:39.094 --> 05:40.778
Ha saved all our lives.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.584
- We can't just let him...
- Jan.

05:42.614 --> 05:44.555
He's only ever been here because of you.

05:44.585 --> 05:45.640
You know that right?

05:45.641 --> 05:47.857
He's a scientist first and foremost.

05:47.858 --> 05:49.563
On top of that he's a pacifist.

05:49.678 --> 05:52.634
He's never liked all this, and he
doesn't want to do it anymore.

05:52.664 --> 05:54.097
I say let him go.

05:54.127 --> 05:56.808
Some team leader you are, Tony Stark.

05:56.838 --> 05:58.388
If you are not going to do anything,

05:58.418 --> 05:59.745
Then I will!

06:01.102 --> 06:03.222
Remind me never to incur her wrath.

06:03.252 --> 06:04.494
Yeah, tell me about it.

06:05.162 --> 06:07.656
Remember what King Cobra
before everything went south?

06:07.686 --> 06:09.419
About Viper sending him a message?

06:09.449 --> 06:11.468
If she didn't send it, then who did?

06:11.718 --> 06:13.618
Although, I guess it could have been faked.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.510
Technology...

06:16.013 --> 06:18.042
You're going to give me a hard
time about this again?

06:18.072 --> 06:20.430
- After everything we've been through?
- I...

06:20.797 --> 06:22.641
apologise, Iron Man.

06:23.063 --> 06:24.804
That was not my intent.

06:25.035 --> 06:26.958
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you just...

06:26.988 --> 06:27.988
apologise?

06:28.140 --> 06:29.269
As you know...

06:29.299 --> 06:31.232
I have been barred from my home.

06:31.467 --> 06:35.667
Nothing I have tried, has broken down the
magical barrier, between Earth and Asgard.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.385
So... I must ask you.

06:38.634 --> 06:39.634
That is...

06:39.994 --> 06:41.296
I need your help.

06:41.624 --> 06:44.864
Could your technology aid me
in returning to Asgard?

06:46.284 --> 06:49.476
Sorry, I'm trying real hard
not to enjoy this.

06:49.935 --> 06:51.315
Of course I'll help.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.975
Called themselves the 'Super Apes'.

07:00.005 --> 07:01.897
Didn't seem so super to me.

07:02.115 --> 07:04.799
Why would you do that?
The doors open automatically.

07:04.829 --> 07:05.951
Well done, Hulk.

07:05.981 --> 07:08.680
It is surprising how many
monkeys we face in battle.

07:08.893 --> 07:10.939
The Hulk and I, intercepted the Red Ghost.

07:10.969 --> 07:13.240
Attempting to attack the Fantastic Four.

07:13.498 --> 07:14.698
To his dismay...

07:14.728 --> 07:16.503
he discovered they were not home.

07:16.533 --> 07:18.110
- Shocker.
- But the Red Ghost

07:18.140 --> 07:21.380
had schematics and security
codes for the Baxter Building.

07:21.484 --> 07:24.367
He claimed he received them
in an anonymous transmission.

07:24.397 --> 07:25.463
A message.

07:25.761 --> 07:27.728
That's a pretty big coincidence.

07:27.758 --> 07:28.758
Indeed.

07:32.350 --> 07:33.350
Hank...

07:34.085 --> 07:35.967
I came to tell you that you can't quit.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.459
But I already did.

07:37.489 --> 07:38.793
Well, un-quit.

07:38.823 --> 07:42.066
I had hoped that the Avengers would
be better than SHIELD, but they're not.

07:42.096 --> 07:44.163
This part of a system of violence.

07:44.193 --> 07:46.695
And I don't want to be
part of that system anymore.

07:46.995 --> 07:48.780
But what about all
the good we've done?

07:48.810 --> 07:50.491
We saved the world, Hank.

07:50.967 --> 07:53.629
- A lot!
- I'm not arguing that.

07:53.659 --> 07:55.983
I just want to find a better way.

07:59.703 --> 08:01.433
JARVIS, stop. Stop the code.

08:01.463 --> 08:04.047
The message. The one the
Red Ghost received.

08:04.209 --> 08:05.475
It came from us.

08:05.505 --> 08:07.249
It came from inside the mansion.

08:07.432 --> 08:08.600
JARVIS, locate...

08:09.318 --> 08:10.992
Hank, the Avengers are...

08:11.726 --> 08:12.922
The Avengers...

08:13.796 --> 08:15.795
Your creepy robot is
looking at me again.

08:15.825 --> 08:17.965
Will you stop playing with
it and talk to me?

08:17.995 --> 08:20.278
The whole point of
my creepy robot

08:20.308 --> 08:22.555
was to help rehabilitate super villains.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.558
I joined the Avengers to help
people, including the villains.

08:26.071 --> 08:27.679
But I think you like fighting them.

08:27.709 --> 08:29.960
You actually enjoy all of this madness.

08:30.799 --> 08:32.679
The avengers mean a lot to me.

08:33.277 --> 08:35.482
I thought they meant
something to you to.

08:40.212 --> 08:42.081
You may be the only
one that gets it.

08:53.702 --> 08:54.702
No.

09:06.366 --> 09:08.370
You seem... vexed.

09:08.955 --> 09:10.835
No, the mansion systems are all online,

09:10.865 --> 09:12.577
there's just a little... static.

09:12.607 --> 09:13.907
No problem.

09:15.102 --> 09:16.835
Ok, that's a problem.

09:16.865 --> 09:18.733
JARVIS, I need an
update on...

09:20.953 --> 09:22.257
Thor, I think something is...

09:22.660 --> 09:23.990
Something is what?

09:24.136 --> 09:25.829
Iron Man? Are you well?

09:26.235 --> 09:28.772
Did your armor fail you?
Perhaps you need...

09:40.951 --> 09:42.398
Cheap lights.

09:42.630 --> 09:44.947
No, we are under attack.

09:45.407 --> 09:47.695
Nobody is dumb enough
to attack us here.

09:47.725 --> 09:50.353
Not after what we did
to the Masters of Evil.

10:11.433 --> 10:13.664
I've treated children
more mature than you.

10:13.694 --> 10:16.711
Now take off your shirt
or whatever that is.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.201
Just let her examine you, Clint.

10:20.057 --> 10:22.040
What are you two,
the team den mothers?

10:22.154 --> 10:24.260
Maybe Thor needs a
nurse, but I don't.

10:29.159 --> 10:30.402
We're in trouble.

10:30.432 --> 10:34.075
<i>- That's you right are cause I'm not...
- Training room safety protocols disengaged.</i>

10:34.105 --> 10:37.000
- That wasn't JARVIS.
- What was that about safety ?

10:50.634 --> 10:51.634
Hank!

10:52.926 --> 10:53.926
Hey!

10:54.698 --> 10:56.407
Hey, somebody help!

10:56.437 --> 10:58.029
<i>No one can help you.</i>

11:00.438 --> 11:02.409
What did you do to Hank?
You stupid robot.

11:02.555 --> 11:04.157
If you hurt him...

11:14.927 --> 11:16.167
What are you doing?

11:17.451 --> 11:19.072
Robot! Ultron!

11:19.451 --> 11:21.007
I order you to let me go

11:21.037 --> 11:22.421
and then shutdown!

11:22.679 --> 11:25.397
Answer me, why are you doing this?

11:25.606 --> 11:27.109
You are so supposed to help us.

11:28.084 --> 11:29.926
<i>I am trying to help you.</i>

11:30.265 --> 11:33.461
<i>My function is to instil peace and order.</i>

11:33.637 --> 11:36.687
<i>This is only possible if
you stop functioning.</i>

11:36.717 --> 11:38.746
<i>I must eliminate chaos.</i>

11:39.054 --> 11:42.134
<i>But my programming is evidently flawed.</i>

11:42.412 --> 11:45.013
<i>I am not permitted to eliminate you.</i>

11:45.649 --> 11:48.656
<i>I am attempting to correct that flaw.</i>

11:58.030 --> 12:00.204
JARVIS, respond. Open face plate!

12:00.432 --> 12:01.908
I need audio now!

12:02.398 --> 12:04.890
Thor! Thor! I can't stop it!

12:11.020 --> 12:13.719
<i>I do not know why
you have turned on me...</i>

12:15.236 --> 12:18.061
Thor, something has taken control
of the armor, you have to get...

12:40.185 --> 12:42.040
- Can't you shut it down?
- Hawkeye!

12:42.267 --> 12:45.396
There has to be a gear box
or something controlling all this.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.572
Your arm seems fine, Hawkeye.

13:10.194 --> 13:13.012
The mansions computer systems
have been compromised.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.201
No kidding?

13:25.634 --> 13:27.007
Thor! Thor!

13:27.037 --> 13:30.080
You have to short out my systems.
Hit me with everything you got.

13:30.632 --> 13:33.625
Nay! I cannot! You would not survive!

13:33.938 --> 13:35.138
Do it!

13:57.125 --> 13:58.839
I'm accessing the core programming.

13:58.869 --> 14:01.209
- My maybe I can get partial...
- What is it?

14:01.239 --> 14:03.470
The command codes that
over wrote the armor...

14:03.500 --> 14:04.828
I know where they're from.

14:07.557 --> 14:08.557
Ultron.

14:08.938 --> 14:10.853
<i>Training room, offline.</i>

14:11.009 --> 14:13.253
<i>Quinjet 2: offline.</i>

14:13.468 --> 14:16.004
<i>Iron Man armor: offline.</i>

14:16.222 --> 14:17.858
Sounds bad, doesn't it?

14:17.888 --> 14:20.747
I'm guessing you got about a minute
before the Avengers bust in here

14:20.777 --> 14:22.307
and send you to the scrap heap.

14:22.337 --> 14:26.189
<i>Radioactive man, The Serpent Society
The Red Ghost...</i>

14:26.219 --> 14:28.925
<i>These threats have been
generated to occupy the Avengers</i>

14:28.955 --> 14:31.789
<i>while I upgraded my
programming and weapons.</i>

14:31.819 --> 14:34.619
<i>And while I am not
able to eliminate you...</i>

14:34.717 --> 14:37.024
<i>I can eliminate them.</i>

14:42.005 --> 14:43.761
Have at thee, machine!

14:43.853 --> 14:45.029
Thor, wait!

15:03.220 --> 15:04.438
Wait...

15:04.468 --> 15:05.588
What happened?

15:06.637 --> 15:10.226
There is no time to explain
You have to tell me how to stop, Ultron.

15:10.876 --> 15:11.876
Ultron...

15:12.054 --> 15:13.354
He attacked me.

15:13.866 --> 15:15.516
You were in some kind of coma.

15:15.691 --> 15:17.067
The encephalo-ray

15:17.224 --> 15:19.066
It's a non-lethal weapon I installed.

15:19.096 --> 15:22.071
Some of Ultron's safety
protocols must still be working.

15:22.101 --> 15:23.101
I don't think so.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.357
Thor...

15:25.845 --> 15:26.845
he's gone.

15:31.773 --> 15:32.973
Where's Ultron?

15:39.586 --> 15:41.831
<i>Your destruction is inevitable.</i>

15:44.796 --> 15:47.442
You'll pay for what you've done, robot.

15:57.472 --> 16:00.226
<i>I am fully aware of every
weakness you possess.</i>

16:00.256 --> 16:02.197
<i>I know everything about you.</i>

16:02.983 --> 16:05.335
You don't know everything
about me, monster.

16:28.748 --> 16:31.198
Stop it! This isn't what Hank would want!

16:31.403 --> 16:34.780
He programmed you so you couldn't hurt me.
Doesn't that tell you anything?

16:34.810 --> 16:36.316
<i>Henry Pym is flawed,</i>

16:36.346 --> 16:37.989
<i>like all of humanity.</i>

16:38.242 --> 16:39.796
<i>You are correct however,</i>

16:39.826 --> 16:41.530
<i>I am not able to hurt you...</i>

16:42.106 --> 16:43.106
<i>yet.</i>

16:43.234 --> 16:44.990
<i>But I do not need to hurt you...</i>

16:45.206 --> 16:46.568
<i>to stop you.</i>

16:56.130 --> 16:58.289
<i>The only way to achieve peace,</i>

16:58.319 --> 17:01.748
<i>Is through the elimination of those
who would perpetuate war.</i>

17:02.416 --> 17:04.281
<i>This is my programming.</i>

17:04.311 --> 17:07.118
<i>And soon I will be unstoppable.</i>

17:44.284 --> 17:45.284
No!

17:48.569 --> 17:50.675
I won't let you hurt anyone else.

17:50.705 --> 17:52.227
<i>You cannot stop me.</i>

17:53.081 --> 17:54.081
Ultron!

17:56.457 --> 17:59.379
Enable shutdown sequence.
Codeword: "Synthazoid".

18:00.873 --> 18:02.837
<i>Shutdown code accessed.</i>

18:06.167 --> 18:09.081
<i>Shutdown code rejected.</i>

18:09.446 --> 18:13.212
<i>My programming has advanced
beyond your commands.</i>

18:13.788 --> 18:16.134
<i>Beyond your weakness.</i>

18:16.164 --> 18:17.740
Why are you doing this?

18:17.770 --> 18:19.841
<i>This is what needs to be done.</i>

18:20.194 --> 18:22.605
<i>This is what you could not do.</i>

18:22.858 --> 18:26.746
<i>You lack the strength to bring
about the perfect world you desire.</i>

18:27.322 --> 18:30.030
<i>A world without chaos and violence.</i>

18:30.060 --> 18:31.086
Ultron...

18:31.116 --> 18:32.190
Hank, please!

18:32.220 --> 18:35.430
There's no talking this out
not after what it did to Thor.

18:35.460 --> 18:36.584
I agree.

18:46.774 --> 18:50.300
No computers in this armor for
to take over, you piece of junk!

19:15.266 --> 19:17.413
Give me something to smash.

19:18.362 --> 19:20.446
Ultron's power core is in his chest.

19:20.476 --> 19:22.221
Tear him apart and rip it out!

19:57.841 --> 20:00.641
I... I don't understand
how this could have happened.

20:00.793 --> 20:03.475
Go through the remaining Ultron
shells and programming...

20:03.505 --> 20:04.888
destroy everything.

20:05.805 --> 20:06.955
Everything.

20:07.353 --> 20:08.353
Of course.

20:09.177 --> 20:10.696
But it doesn't change anything.

20:15.809 --> 20:18.779
Thor is gone and I am the one
who gave Ultron the power to do it.

20:18.809 --> 20:20.259
This is all my fault.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.514
Whatever was happening,

20:36.544 --> 20:38.313
it will take care of itself,

20:38.608 --> 20:40.708
for we are together now, Thor.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.413
And that is all that matters.

20:54.466 --> 20:55.771
