00:10.303 --> 00:13.973
<i>NARRATOR". A sunny Wednesday morning
in Gotham City.</i>

00:14.140 --> 00:17.936
<i>The sort of Wednesday
that makes you wish it were Sunday.</i>

00:18.102 --> 00:20.480
<i>And at Gotham City City Hall...</i>

00:20.647 --> 00:23.858
<i>...a stream of tourists wend their way</i> in...

00:24.025 --> 00:29.113
<i>...to see the curios and trophies
on permanent display.</i>

00:29.280 --> 00:31.491
And this, ladies and gentlemen...

00:31.658 --> 00:34.911
...is the original charter of Gotham City.

00:35.078 --> 00:38.289
And due to its excessive age
and delicate condition...

00:38.456 --> 00:42.961
...it has been sealed in this guaranteed
burglar-proof display case...

00:43.127 --> 00:47.799
...which has been vacuum sealed
to protect such a valuable document.

00:47.966 --> 00:51.970
Oh, guide, are you absolutely
certain it's burglar-proof?

00:52.136 --> 00:53.429
Absolutely.

00:54.013 --> 00:56.266
And now, if you step this way, please.

00:59.978 --> 01:02.313
Your eggspert has much to learn.

01:10.488 --> 01:15.618
No material can resist
my incomparable eggsplosives.

01:29.382 --> 01:33.011
And now, let us make our eggsit.

01:37.557 --> 01:39.851
Impossible.
That a criminal could march in...

01:40.018 --> 01:43.855
...and purloin Gotham City's most priceless
possession right under our nostrils?

01:44.022 --> 01:46.858
But why, commissioner?
That's what I can't figure out.

01:47.025 --> 01:50.403
Nor can I, O'Hara, nor can I.
What did the witnesses say?

01:50.570 --> 01:54.198
Oh, there's no doubt about it.
They all agreed on one thing: His description.

01:54.365 --> 01:58.369
- It was Egghead, all right.
-The rottenest egg of them all.

01:58.870 --> 02:00.538
Any suggestions, O'Hara?

02:00.705 --> 02:05.460
Well, it isn't so bad facing thieves,
murderers, run-of-the-mill crooks, but--

02:05.627 --> 02:09.881
I know it seems we call on
the Caped Crusader pretty often.

02:10.048 --> 02:12.717
There's no other way to handle it.

02:13.343 --> 02:18.056
<i>NARRATOR". And in stately Wayne Manor,
home of millionaire Bruce Wayne...</i>

02:18.222 --> 02:21.392
...and <i>his youthful ward
Dick Grayson:</i>

02:29.025 --> 02:31.694
If you'll hold the line a moment, sir...

02:31.861 --> 02:34.405
...I will gain his attention for you.

02:37.408 --> 02:38.993
You see, Dick, many years ago...

02:39.160 --> 02:42.914
...Gotham City was founded by three
families who landed at Gotham Rock.

02:43.081 --> 02:46.250
- The Savages, the Tylers and the Waynes.
-Right.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.003
The original land was leased
from the Mohican Indians...

02:49.170 --> 02:51.839
...for the price of nine raccoon pelts.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.759
Wow, what a deal that was.

02:54.926 --> 02:57.428
Every five years,
the lease has to be renewed.

02:57.595 --> 03:01.557
The city charter is very specific
about honoring that debt.

03:01.724 --> 03:06.938
Tonight is the night to make payment,
so Pete Savage, Tim Tyler and I...

03:07.105 --> 03:11.859
...the descendants of the original settlers,
have to deliver three raccoon pelts each...

03:12.026 --> 03:15.530
...to Chief Screaming Chicken
in order to fulfill the obligation.

03:15.697 --> 03:17.448
Gosh, where did you get the pelts?

03:17.615 --> 03:23.705
I had to buy a whole raccoon coat
from a very popular crooner of the 1920s...

03:23.871 --> 03:26.666
...who'd fallen on hard times.

03:26.833 --> 03:28.626
Had to pay a pretty price for it too.

03:28.793 --> 03:32.547
This one's held up very well for a raccoon.

03:35.717 --> 03:37.552
A matter of grave importance
has arisen.

03:37.719 --> 03:39.679
Your attention would be appreciated.

03:39.846 --> 03:43.015
A contract to be, ahem, read.

03:43.182 --> 03:47.228
- I will take care of it immediately, Alfred.
<i>- I'll</i> go with you, Bruce.

03:47.937 --> 03:52.984
Honestly, Alfred, those two are so busy.

03:53.151 --> 03:57.739
I'll wager Batman and Robin
don't get around as much as Bruce and Dick.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.825
I, uh-- I rather doubt that, madam.

04:01.868 --> 04:03.745
- Yes, commissioner.
-Dire news, Batman.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.664
Egghead is back with a carton full of crime.

04:06.831 --> 04:08.583
We'll be right there.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.712
To the Batpoles.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.380
Why go to all that trouble
to steal the city charter?

05:37.547 --> 05:39.090
Who knows what evil lurks.

05:39.257 --> 05:42.426
He's a tough egg, Batman,
the smartest man in the world.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.595
The second-smartest man in the world.

05:44.762 --> 05:46.639
Present company excepted, of course.

05:46.806 --> 05:50.643
He's assuredly the smartest villain
we've ever faced.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.854
Any evidence left
at the scene of the crime?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.773
None, Boy Wonder.
Frankly, we're stumped.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.527
The Gotham City Charter.

05:59.694 --> 06:00.903
What does it say?

06:01.070 --> 06:03.531
Aside from its constitutional edicts...

06:03.698 --> 06:08.369
...its purpose is to act as a treaty between
the Mohican Indians and the founders.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.829
Holy Bill of Rights.

06:09.996 --> 06:14.083
Maybe Egghead wants to start a war between
the Gotham City citizens and the Indians.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.960
I rather doubt it, Robin.

06:16.127 --> 06:17.837
There's only one Indian left.

06:18.004 --> 06:21.424
He'd be outnumbered ten million to one.

06:21.591 --> 06:26.387
I think it has something to do
with the leasing conditions.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.681
That probably means
Egghead will make a deal...

06:28.848 --> 06:31.851
...with Peter Savage,
Tim Tyler or Bruce Wayne.

06:32.018 --> 06:34.812
Egghead does not make deals.

06:34.979 --> 06:36.856
Oh, where is Peter Savage now?

06:37.023 --> 06:39.567
Undoubtedly at his home
here in Gotham City.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.611
He spends most of his time in Paris.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.780
He's something of a bon vivant
and patron of the arts.

06:44.947 --> 06:50.161
But he's always here for the
Raccoon Ceremony and to distribute the pelts.

06:50.328 --> 06:52.330
And I think I know where Tim Tyler is.

06:52.496 --> 06:56.584
Probably at Tyler Stadium, watching
his team play baseball against the Pets.

06:56.751 --> 06:58.336
That leaves only Bruce Wayne.

06:59.003 --> 07:00.630
I, uh, wonder where he is.

07:00.796 --> 07:04.675
Unquestionably,
out doing something inconsequential...

07:04.842 --> 07:07.303
...with his youthful ward, Dick Grayson.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.513
You know
how those millionaire playboys are.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.515
- Let's go, Robin.
-Where to?

07:11.682 --> 07:15.519
To the teepee of Screaming Chicken,
last of the Mohicans.

07:18.356 --> 07:23.986
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, behind the doors
of an apparently legitimate import firm:</i>

07:26.656 --> 07:28.115
Eggscellent.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.994
I might even go so far as
to say eggsquisite.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.746
What you got in mind, boss?

07:33.913 --> 07:36.082
This just looks like
some old piece of paper.

07:36.248 --> 07:39.210
That's because you have no foresight,
Benedict.

07:39.377 --> 07:41.545
Not everybody is as smart
as you are, Egghead.

07:41.712 --> 07:45.216
Not anybody is as smart as I am,
Foo Yung. Ha, ha.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.885
Please, don't talk so fast.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.638
What's she following us around
for all the time?

07:50.805 --> 07:52.682
I don't like dames on capers.

07:52.848 --> 07:56.227
Fortunately, not everyone thinks like that,
Mr. Benedict.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.354
Hi, Eggybaby.

07:58.521 --> 08:04.902
Please, it's Mr. Egghead
before other people, not Eggybaby.

08:05.069 --> 08:09.573
My eggsecutive secretary, Miss Bacon,
is taking down my every thought.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.951
That way posterity will have on record...

08:12.118 --> 08:16.414
...the working of the most brilliant
criminal mind of all time.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.332
If I do say so myself.

08:18.499 --> 08:19.959
You gonna publish a book?

08:20.126 --> 08:24.296
Well, now, let us eggsamine
this more carefully, huh?

08:24.463 --> 08:27.425
There must be a loophole in this charter...

08:27.591 --> 08:32.096
...that will enable me to eggstort
control of the city.

08:32.263 --> 08:34.807
Here it is.
Look at that, my rotten eggs.

08:34.974 --> 08:36.308
"Whereas, and to wit...

08:36.475 --> 08:40.270
...if the price of nine raccoon pelts
is not paid to the Mohican representative...

08:40.438 --> 08:43.399
...by the descendants of the Savage,
Tyler and Wayne families...

08:43.566 --> 08:45.776
...and whereas, if it is not paid on time...

08:45.943 --> 08:49.488
...said land will revert back
to its original owners...

08:49.655 --> 08:51.490
...and/or their legal representatives."

08:51.657 --> 08:57.288
Oh, we've got them this time. We've caught
them with their eggs post facto down.

08:59.123 --> 09:02.251
- What's he talking about?
-Search me.

09:02.418 --> 09:05.921
- A little slower, please. My fingers hurt.
-Eh, mm?

09:06.297 --> 09:11.135
Don't you know
who the representative of the Mohicans is?

09:11.719 --> 09:15.890
Oh, you mean that little guy that's got
the blanket concession out on the highway?

09:16.057 --> 09:17.683
Eggsactly.

09:18.768 --> 09:22.563
Chief Screaming Chicken...

09:23.105 --> 09:26.484
...the last of the Mohicans.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.164
- How?
-What?

09:40.331 --> 09:42.333
- When?
-Where?

09:52.343 --> 09:57.389
You, you are only person in Gotham City
who know traditional Mohican greeting.

09:57.556 --> 10:00.935
I've long been a student of your tribal customs,
Chief Screaming Chicken.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.853
What you want with Screaming Chicken?

10:03.020 --> 10:06.607
Tonight's the night when you receive payment
on the Gotham City lease renewal.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.693
Me think price too low for Gotham City.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.489
Nine raccoon pelts,
cost of living go up and up.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.449
Me want 12 raccoon pelts.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.743
The contract was for nine.

10:17.910 --> 10:20.246
Indian poor businessman.

10:20.412 --> 10:25.126
My cousin, oh...
He sell Manhattan for 24 dollars.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.961
Could have got 35.

10:27.128 --> 10:29.421
Be that as it may,
Chief Screaming Chicken...

10:29.588 --> 10:32.675
...I'm here to make sure you're present
at the ceremonies tonight.

10:32.842 --> 10:34.426
It's imperative that you attend.

10:35.678 --> 10:36.804
Absolutely.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.140
Thank you.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.768
Ciao, Chief.

10:59.160 --> 11:03.581
A magnificent eggshibition,
Chief Screaming Chicken.

11:03.747 --> 11:10.254
When I'm done with you, you will be able to
eggsercise your most eggstravagant desires.

11:10.421 --> 11:15.092
If you give me an eggsclusive
lease on Gotham City.

11:15.926 --> 11:19.221
Me no give you lease, not until tonight.

11:19.388 --> 11:23.726
Me honor-bound,
if paid nine raccoon pelt.

11:23.893 --> 11:26.729
- And if not?
-Me deal with highest bidder.

11:26.896 --> 11:30.691
But don't worry, they pay me pelts.
They always do, it is tradition.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.569
Ah, but tonight,
one of those men won't show up...

11:33.736 --> 11:35.821
...and then the lease will eggspire.

11:35.988 --> 11:40.284
You make mighty big talk, kemosabe.

11:40.451 --> 11:42.494
Kemosabe?

11:43.037 --> 11:45.164
I thought I heard
just about everything but.

11:45.331 --> 11:48.334
- Yeah, Screaming, what's that mean?
-Me no know.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.295
Me hear it once on radio. Very old word.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.388
It's no use, Robin.

12:01.555 --> 12:05.142
Not a single new egg company has opened
in Gotham City in the last few weeks.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.019
I can't understand.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.812
That's his usual modus operandi.

12:08.979 --> 12:12.316
Egghead always has his hideout associated
with some sort of egg outfit.

12:12.483 --> 12:15.819
Obviously, he's changed
his way of thinking...

12:15.986 --> 12:19.490
...and if that's not enough,
he's probably changed the way he--

12:20.032 --> 12:23.702
Oh, well, that's it. Of course.

12:23.869 --> 12:28.832
What kind of company sells eggs
that you can't fry, scramble or boil?

12:29.333 --> 12:32.253
- A fish egg company.
-Right, Robin. Let's see what that brings.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.182
Look at this.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.185
A new egg firm has just opened
on Point View Street.

12:49.270 --> 12:52.356
"The Ghoti Oeufs Caviar Company."

12:52.523 --> 12:55.901
"Oeuf" means "eggs" in French,
but I don't get this other word at all.

12:56.068 --> 12:58.570
The word is "fish," Robin.

12:59.405 --> 13:04.243
-"Ghoti" is "fish"?
-See here, English phonetics.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.124
G-H becomes F...

13:10.291 --> 13:12.042
...as in "tough" or "laugh."

13:12.209 --> 13:15.129
O becomes I as in "women."

13:15.296 --> 13:19.550
T-I becomes S-H...

13:19.717 --> 13:22.928
...as in "ration" or the word "nation."

13:23.095 --> 13:26.223
Holy semantics, Batman,
you never cease to amaze me.

13:26.390 --> 13:29.893
No time for compliments now, Robin.
We must thwart some criminals.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.312
To the Batmobile.

13:32.271 --> 13:35.899
Oh, you're making a fine deal,
Chief Screaming Chicken.

13:36.066 --> 13:39.445
One hundred dollars a month for life
and all the eggs you can eat.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.239
Me 60 years old now.

13:42.406 --> 13:43.741
Me need them pension.

13:43.907 --> 13:47.578
You 60?
I hope I look that good when I'm 60.

13:47.745 --> 13:51.040
Well, I have great eggspectations
for our relationship, chief.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.417
I tell you what I'll give you
as an added bonus:

13:53.584 --> 13:56.587
You may have the import-eggsport
concession...

13:56.754 --> 14:01.258
...for all genuine American Indian
blankets made in Japan.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.760
Oh, heh.

14:02.926 --> 14:06.930
You are one heck of fine pale face.
Mm. Yeah.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.016
- You no Indian giver?
-Oh, no.

14:09.183 --> 14:12.311
Eggybaby never gave an Indian anything.

14:12.478 --> 14:17.024
Well, I for one am eggshausted.

14:17.191 --> 14:24.114
It's been a trying day,
and I must rest my fantastic brain for tonight.

14:27.743 --> 14:31.288
There'll be no rest for the wicked today,
Egghead.

14:31.455 --> 14:34.458
Boy, do you guys have egg
on your faces.

14:34.625 --> 14:38.295
All the king's horses and all the king's men
won't be able to put you together again.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.798
Oh, Batman, you're so lyrical.

15:29.847 --> 15:33.517
Well, that's enough eggsercise for one day,
Batman.

15:33.684 --> 15:36.270
You no stop, me give Boy Wonder
very short haircut.

15:36.437 --> 15:38.564
You, Chicken, turn chicken?

15:38.730 --> 15:40.566
Have you joined the enemy camp as well?

15:40.732 --> 15:43.152
This is an acid egg, Batman.

15:43.318 --> 15:46.363
One move and I'll drop it on Robin's head.

15:46.530 --> 15:49.032
Nobody could be that rotten.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.827
Don't tempt me.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.162
Ow!

15:54.788 --> 15:58.709
You put all your eggs in one basket,
Egghead, a fatal mistake.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.545
Prepare yourself for an eggspeditious defeat.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.590
- That's very apt, Robin.
-Oh, glad you liked it.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.800
Well, see how you like this.

16:09.219 --> 16:14.099
- What is it, Batman?
-I don't know.

16:16.101 --> 16:21.148
Whatever it is, it's awfully funny.

16:21.315 --> 16:23.901
The yolk's on them, it's laughing gas.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.987
Ha, ha! It's the funniest trick
anyone's ever pulled on us.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.947
- Yes.
-Ha-ha-ha!

16:29.114 --> 16:31.366
It's even funnier than the Joker.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.787
I can't stop laughing.

16:35.954 --> 16:39.124
And you won't, not until the gas wears off.

16:39.291 --> 16:43.712
- Let's go, boss, before we start laughing too.
-An eggscellent idea.

16:45.506 --> 16:47.508
- Let's go after them.
-No, no, no.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.760
Not now, old chum.

16:50.260 --> 16:54.264
In our condition, it won't do us any good.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.141
Here, here.

16:56.308 --> 16:58.268
Here, take this.

16:58.435 --> 17:05.108
It's a sad pill to neutralize the laughing gas.
Ha-ha-ha!

17:05.275 --> 17:07.819
It'll clear our minds.

17:12.907 --> 17:16.869
Well, he may have won the first round...

17:20.374 --> 17:25.253
...but we're going to fight fire with fire.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.214
Robin...

17:28.214 --> 17:33.762
...we'll never beat Egghead
with brute strength.

17:34.179 --> 17:38.392
We must-- We must out-think him.

17:41.311 --> 17:46.567
That poor, misguided redskin,
Chief Screaming Chicken...

17:46.733 --> 17:49.152
...is obviously under Eggheads influence.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.738
Therefore, it stands to reason...

17:51.905 --> 17:56.618
...that the lease to Gotham City must be
close to being in Egghead's greedy hands.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.037
How do we stop it from happening?

17:59.204 --> 18:04.334
Egghead must prevent either one
or all three of the millionaires...

18:04.501 --> 18:08.297
...from delivering their pelts
in order to break the lease.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.882
- Shall I call Tim Tyler and Pete Savage?
-I'll do it.

18:11.049 --> 18:16.513
The machine is attuned to Bruce Wayne's
voice. Klondike 57589, please.

18:17.014 --> 18:20.350
Gosh, Batman, I've never seen
you use a telephone directory.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.562
- How do you remember all those numbers?
-Elementary, my dear Robin.

18:23.729 --> 18:26.732
I simply transpose the numbers into letters.

18:26.898 --> 18:32.654
For example, Pete Savage's number is
the name of a girl that he and I used to date.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.406
Holy IT&T.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.033
<i>Hello?</i>

18:36.533 --> 18:38.410
Hello, Pete, Bruce Wayne here.

18:38.577 --> 18:42.706
I'm calling to see whether you'll be attending
the anniversary celebration tonight.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.541
It's the Raccoon Ceremony,
you know.

18:44.708 --> 18:48.045
Certainement, I'll be there.
You're grand marshal this year, aren't you?

18:48.211 --> 18:51.757
Heh, yes, it should be fun.
It's nice to have you back in town, Pete.

18:51.923 --> 18:55.761
Be it ever so humble,
there is no place like Gotham City.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.262
<i>Au revoir, Pete.</i>

19:01.558 --> 19:03.393
Very good, Mr. Savage.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.021
Everything sounds good there,
let's try Tim Tyler.

19:06.188 --> 19:09.524
Quentin 65701, please.

19:09.691 --> 19:13.070
You can't make a word out of that one
because of the one and the zero.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.781
Things don't always work out
like we want them to.

19:15.947 --> 19:19.326
When that happens, I simply depend
on my well-developed memory.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.578
When was the last time you called
that number?

19:21.745 --> 19:23.997
- Yesterday.
-Sally, you're a whiz, Batman.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.834
- Tim Tyler speaking.
-Hello, Tim, this is Bruce Wayne.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.003
Bruce, how are you?

19:30.170 --> 19:34.257
- Are you attending the ceremony tonight?
-Wouldn't miss it if it meant my life.

19:34.424 --> 19:37.761
- Oh, that's swell. See you there.
-Right.

19:38.428 --> 19:43.225
You demonstrated uneggspected
good sense, Mr. Tyler.

19:43.392 --> 19:44.935
What do you want from me, Egghead?

19:45.102 --> 19:48.522
I am just a poor major-league
baseball team owner.

19:48.689 --> 19:51.858
How about season tickets?
I love halfbacks.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.487
How eggsasperating.

19:59.449 --> 20:02.536
Oh, what a beautiful night.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.207
Mercy alive, do we look sharp?

20:07.374 --> 20:09.126
Have a good time, boys.

20:09.292 --> 20:13.130
And don't stay out too late,
you know how I worry.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.465
I wonder where our official escort is.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.843
- Dick, do you have the pelts?
-Here they are.

20:18.009 --> 20:21.430
But I doubt if Chief Screaming Chicken
will be there to claim them.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.390
Not after all he's done.

20:23.557 --> 20:30.355
Still, we must live up to our part of the bargain
and deliver nine pelts before midnight.

20:30.522 --> 20:34.818
I'll never understand why Chief Screaming
Chicken decided to put in with Egghead.

20:34.985 --> 20:37.904
He told me once that he worked
for a while as a bottle washer.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.826
He had an argument with a boss
who told him to go back to his own country.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.579
- But this is his country.
-Ha-ha-ha.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.289
Exactly.

20:47.456 --> 20:50.208
And you wonder why
Chief Screaming Chicken is dissatisfied.

20:50.375 --> 20:54.212
- Your escort, sir.
-Thank you, Alfred.

20:59.593 --> 21:02.512
- So they got you too.
-What do you mean?

21:02.679 --> 21:05.348
This is a trap, Bruce.
Egghead is driving this limousine.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.267
And we walked right into it.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.686
We can always get out.

21:10.771 --> 21:13.690
- There's no handle on this door.
- That's correct.

21:13.857 --> 21:18.361
So get ready for an eggsotic eggsperience.

21:32.918 --> 21:37.214
There are several reasons
why I called this meeting, gentlemen...

21:37.380 --> 21:42.552
...aside from the obvious one of keeping
you all from the anniversary ceremonies...

21:42.719 --> 21:47.349
...when Chief Screaming Chicken
appears to collect his raccoon pelts.

21:47.516 --> 21:51.937
It has occurred to me
that one of you is Batman.

21:52.687 --> 21:58.360
- How exciting.
-Yes, you see this fiendish machine?

21:58.527 --> 22:00.779
Well, it's one of my own inventions.

22:00.946 --> 22:06.993
For lack of another name for it,
I call it an electro thought transferor.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.913
It sucks every shred of information...

22:10.080 --> 22:14.251
...from the mind of the person
sitting under that apparatus...

22:14.417 --> 22:18.421
...and places it in the brain
of the one under this one.

22:18.588 --> 22:20.966
- How ugly.
-How disgusting.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.260
How eggshilarating.

22:23.426 --> 22:28.139
Long ago, my superior intellect
deduced that Batman must be a person...

22:28.306 --> 22:30.642
...who was a millionaire
and didn't have to work...

22:30.809 --> 22:34.771
...because crime-fighting
is such an eggspensive hobby.

22:34.938 --> 22:39.693
- Which one is it, Eggybaby, hmm?
-Please, please, Miss Bacon.

22:39.860 --> 22:44.114
All of you are approximately
the right age, in your early 30s...

22:44.281 --> 22:47.659
...but I have eliminated you, Mr. Tyler,
because you are left-handed.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.953
No, the Caped Crusader
is not a port-sider.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.373
And you, Mr. Savage,
are out because of your accent.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.127
So aside from a couple
of aging rock 'n' roll singers...

22:57.294 --> 23:00.213
...you, Mr. Wayne,
are the only Gotham City millionaire...

23:00.380 --> 23:04.259
...who is athletically inclined
with eggsessive agility.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.220
Therefore, you must be Batman.

23:07.888 --> 23:11.057
You realize this is all a waste of time.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.102
Not at all, Mr. Wayne.

23:14.269 --> 23:19.858
My machine has a rather eggscentric
and ugly side effect.

23:20.483 --> 23:24.654
In removing all of the knowledge
from your brain...

23:24.821 --> 23:28.241
...it will leave you an empty-headed fop.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.328
There's no use struggling,
Mr. Wayne...

23:31.494 --> 23:34.497
...you're being held there
by an electromagnetic force.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.375
I'm leaving.
Things like this give me a headache.

23:37.542 --> 23:41.421
All right, Benedict, turn on the machine.

23:45.175 --> 23:47.928
It will take a moment or two to warm up...

23:48.094 --> 23:53.433
...and then we shall see
if my eggseptional logistics are correct.

23:53.600 --> 23:57.437
But even if I'm wrong about
your being Batman, Mr. Wayne...

23:58.229 --> 24:02.275
...your brain will be utterly destroyed.
