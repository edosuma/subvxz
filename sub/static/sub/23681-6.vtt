.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.375
- What does happen
on Butcher's Block?

00:08.576 --> 00:10.044
- People go missing.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.645
You've probably seen
the murals.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.647
White face, bloody mouth.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.417
They say it's Joseph Peach.

00:16.450 --> 00:20.054
Now when people disappear
they say the butcher took 'em.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.556
- So you're going to
be meeting Tanya Marcus

00:22.590 --> 00:24.292
and her daughter, Izzy.

00:24.325 --> 00:27.095
- Will you make sure nothing
happens to me and my mom?

00:27.128 --> 00:28.296
- Of course.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.398
Izzy!
Someone took them.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.300
- When mom knows CPS
is arriving,

00:32.333 --> 00:34.268
sometimes they just ghost.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.669
- You didn't hear her scream.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.172
- They don't matter.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.840
You know I'm right,
Mr. Mouse Man.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.575
[gunshot]
[gasps]

00:43.211 --> 00:44.845

their heads.

[saw buzzing]

00:47.881 --> 00:49.417
- What's in there?

00:49.450 --> 00:52.320
- Bootleggers built the houses,
all tunnels.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.155
- There is something else
in this house.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.623
[eerie screeches]
[indistinct whispers]

00:55.656 --> 00:57.358
What they pray to.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.194
- We promised the little girl.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.696
We must deliver
the little girl.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.864
- [groans softly]

01:03.897 --> 01:05.266
- Izzy?

01:05.299 --> 01:06.834
They lied about Izzy.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.736
[flies buzzing]

01:08.769 --> 01:09.870
- I know.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.871
- I want to go back

01:10.904 --> 01:12.306
to the way I was.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.607
- What are you doing?

01:13.641 --> 01:15.876
- I am going to go
find us a door

01:15.909 --> 01:18.579
that leads downstairs.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.115
- Where's Zoe?
- I think she left.

01:21.149 --> 01:23.317
- [panting]

01:24.252 --> 01:26.387
- She did?

01:28.189 --> 01:30.224
I'll bring her back to you.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.360
I promise.

*

02:15.969 --> 02:17.938
- How are you doing?

02:17.971 --> 02:23.244
- My head feels so clear.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.416
I feel like I can breathe.

02:28.449 --> 02:33.187
Like my mind is finally
on my side again.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.690
- There's, um...

02:36.724 --> 02:39.393
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

02:40.761 --> 02:45.199
It's a promise we made
that needs to be fulfilled

02:45.233 --> 02:48.402
so we don't lose
our dreaming here.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.306
- A promise to who?

02:52.340 --> 02:55.309
- A higher power of some kind.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.980
Gave us the Summer House.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.784
- What kind of higher power?

03:03.817 --> 03:07.321
Is it--is it beautiful?

03:07.355 --> 03:09.990
- It's so beautiful;

03:10.023 --> 03:12.793
it'll make your eyes bleed.

03:12.826 --> 03:16.330
- Can I see this higher power?
- You can.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.432
Before the offering.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.903
- What offering?

03:22.936 --> 03:25.038
- A little angel.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.811
- Izzy.
- Yes.

03:32.380 --> 03:36.284
Our god has many angels.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.953
We promised her to him,
but she got away.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.523
We have to deliver her tonight.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.727
If we don't, it will be
very dangerous for all of us.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.732
We have to accept it.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.503
You understand?

04:04.545 --> 04:08.349

gonna work.

05:45.112 --> 05:48.482
We can't just go after them.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.652
Maybe it is time
for us to just go.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.022
- [raspy voice] Give up?

05:55.055 --> 05:58.626
- Look, I want them dead
just as much as you do.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.028
But I am not so deluded
that I think

06:01.061 --> 06:02.930
that we're going to win.

06:09.537 --> 06:13.173
- I'm going after them.

Are you gonna help me or not?

Who is it?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.883
Okay, open the door
just a little.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.992
- She came back.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.895
I found her hiding.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.831
- Come inside.
- No, thank you.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.000
Go.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.069
Go.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.974
Keep her safe when they come.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.776
- We will.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.812
Diane, um...

07:27.548 --> 07:29.850
Hey. How you doing?
- Hi.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.218
- We got you.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.587
Let's go get you cleaned up.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.657
[water running]

07:37.057 --> 07:40.828
Let's get this off of you.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.263
What is this?
[chuckles]

07:43.296 --> 07:44.698
[door shuts]

07:44.732 --> 07:46.099
Well, we're gonna get
rid of it

07:46.133 --> 07:47.601
and you're gonna be shiny

07:47.635 --> 07:49.002
like a new penny.
- Izzy! Izzy!

07:49.036 --> 07:51.104
Where is she?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.840
Oh, my God.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.743
Oh, my gosh.
You made it.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.244
Oh.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.648
I knew you could do it.
- I hid like you told me to.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.283
- You did so good.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.118
- Where's Alice?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.559
- She stayed.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.762
[dog barking]

08:15.963 --> 08:17.665
[sighs]

08:23.203 --> 08:26.574
- So that's it?
There's nothing we can do.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.141
- Maybe there is.

08:32.913 --> 08:36.049
There is something else
up there with them.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.087
Something that's
not one of them.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.923
It's this--this thing

08:42.956 --> 08:46.627
that gives them everything
that they have.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.033
- What are you saying?

08:56.103 --> 08:58.706
- It wants her.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.143
And they are very scared
of what it will do

09:03.176 --> 09:05.879
to them if they can't deliver.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.149
- Is that right?

09:10.918 --> 09:13.954
So they'll be coming for her.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.791
- Oh, I have a feeling
they're coming right now.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.359
- Then we'll just have
to make sure

09:19.392 --> 09:22.029
they don't get their hands
on her.

09:22.062 --> 09:26.066
We'll let them Peaches
pay what they owe.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.803
Take my car and drive

09:29.837 --> 09:31.672
as far and as fast as we can.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.607
- I'll get it running.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.249
[dark tone]

09:42.282 --> 09:44.151
Alice.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.853
- Hi, Zoe.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.958
- Um, what are you doing here?

09:52.225 --> 09:54.127
Where are the Peaches?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.631
They just let you leave?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.734
- I can leave whenever I want.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.402
Aren't you gonna let me in?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.638
- I don't think so.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.309
Are they with you?

10:09.342 --> 10:11.278
- I know that Izzy's in there.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.746
Now, you can give her to me,

10:12.780 --> 10:14.948
or they're gonna come
and take her.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.988
- You were so scared
of losing your mind

10:21.021 --> 10:23.724
and then you just
gave it away.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.829
- You need me
more than ever.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.898
Let me take care of you.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.866

have to worry about

10:32.900 --> 10:36.103
money or Mom or being sick.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.740
- How about we get in a car
and get the hell out of here,

10:39.773 --> 10:41.308
and we make a fresh start
in a place

10:41.341 --> 10:43.711
with way less cannibalism.

10:45.212 --> 10:48.882
- Give me Izzy
and I'll let you on your way.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.956
- You're really one of them
now, aren't you?

10:57.825 --> 10:59.693
- I would rather

10:59.727 --> 11:02.062
live in a world
with no pain.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.164

Thank you.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.486

11:26.519 --> 11:29.156
Hey, um, maybe
you can help me out.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.092
I'm not from around here.
I'm just passing through.

for a friend of mine, Alice.

Alice Woods.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.335
- Why?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.271
- I just thought I'd say hi.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.140
Alice and I were old friends
from college.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.945
- I didn't have any friends
in college.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.748
- Hi, Alice.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.184
- You're the student loan guy.
- Yeah.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.320
And you owe us 90 grand,

you delusional brat.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.124
That's with interest.

And what? You thought you
can just avoid that?

12:06.293 --> 12:07.961
Ignore that?

12:07.995 --> 12:09.362
[scoffs] Of course you did.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.364
Because what?
The world owes you, right?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.834
Because somebody else will just
come in and take care of it.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.102
Right?
No.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.137
Now, you took out
a loan, sweetheart,

12:17.170 --> 12:19.539
and now you got
to pay up, okay?
