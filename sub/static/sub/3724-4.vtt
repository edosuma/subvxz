00:02.003 --> 00:05.922
Now, without further ado,
your suitor, Adam Cromwell!

00:05.947 --> 00:08.730
He's the British heir to
the Cromwell Hotel fortune.

00:08.755 --> 00:10.114
Oh! Oh, my God!

00:10.139 --> 00:11.820
I was trying to open a new hotel...

00:11.845 --> 00:13.378
my own, without my father.

00:13.403 --> 00:15.757
Royal hottie drops trou with three...

00:15.782 --> 00:17.426
or, I'm sorry, was it four hookers?

00:17.451 --> 00:18.550
And then tweets a selfie?

00:18.575 --> 00:19.617
Screw you. I don't know you.

00:19.642 --> 00:21.742
I know you. Or, at
least, I know your agenda.

00:21.767 --> 00:23.805
Nobody's gonna bet money on your hotel

00:23.830 --> 00:25.615
until you rehab your image.

00:25.640 --> 00:26.770
Grace, hey, listen to me.

00:26.795 --> 00:27.969
If you want to win Adam,

00:27.994 --> 00:29.532
you're just gonna have to change your act.

00:29.556 --> 00:31.211
You just don't want Adam to be with me.

00:31.236 --> 00:33.109
I've seen the way you look at him.

00:33.318 --> 00:35.261
I kind of like it, though, the
way you're busting my balls.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.445
- Don't do that, okay? Mnh-mnh.
- No? Sure?

00:37.470 --> 00:38.781
Well, no. Let's just stay on topic.

00:38.936 --> 00:41.993
Our D.P. here is leaving us. To Carl!

00:42.217 --> 00:44.789
I want Carl's job. I
want you to get it for me.

00:44.814 --> 00:45.616
You've got Quinn's ear.

00:45.641 --> 00:46.878
You should have talked
to her a long time ago.

00:46.903 --> 00:48.467
And commit you to this? No.

00:48.492 --> 00:51.176
Getting out was your dream. It's not mine.

00:52.249 --> 00:54.756
You're the only thing in my
life that I've ever done right.

00:54.781 --> 00:56.268
My arm's tingling. Call 911.

00:56.293 --> 00:57.500
Aah! I need an ambulance.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.588
Uh, a heart attack.

00:58.613 --> 01:00.613
Chet's not easy, but he needs you.

01:00.647 --> 01:03.268
Actually, I wanted to thank
you for sleeping with him.

01:03.293 --> 01:05.144
It keeps him from wandering too far.

01:05.170 --> 01:06.872
You're a real class act.

01:06.897 --> 01:08.965
One of the dates has to be
at my hotel site in Napa.

01:08.990 --> 01:10.255
Done, all right?

01:10.280 --> 01:12.724
Now, just get back to work, you limey pick.

01:13.831 --> 01:16.386
Tonight on "Everlasting,"

01:16.715 --> 01:19.693
it's down to our final 10 contestants.

01:19.718 --> 01:23.084
And after last week's
emotional roller coaster,

01:23.109 --> 01:29.163
it's becoming far more difficult
for our suitor to say goodbye.

01:30.153 --> 01:32.720
[Chuckles] That was good.

01:33.025 --> 01:34.230
Ooh, look at that.

01:34.256 --> 01:36.506
Goosebumps. Chills. You?

01:36.531 --> 01:37.522
Yeah.

01:37.547 --> 01:40.256
That was, like, really good.

01:40.281 --> 01:42.703
Huh?

Do you think people are gonna miss me?

01:49.273 --> 01:53.351
Honey, you have got <i> it,</i> babe.

01:53.376 --> 01:55.209
Trust me. The world is gonna love you.

01:55.234 --> 01:56.359
Maybe I shouldn't leave.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.982
You could talk to the
producers, have me come back.

01:59.007 --> 02:00.368
It could be like a surprise.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.136
Come here.

02:04.252 --> 02:07.260
Thank you. You are amazing.

02:08.394 --> 02:12.014
My car will take you to the airport.

02:14.371 --> 02:17.339
[Indistinct conversations]

02:17.364 --> 02:18.637
Man: Morning.

02:18.662 --> 02:21.617
We'll be heading in the girls'
room in just, uh, five minutes.

02:21.971 --> 02:23.904
Mary: Why won't they tell us
anything about this group date?

02:23.929 --> 02:25.365
I mean, how are we supposed to prepare?

02:25.390 --> 02:26.881
Well, we don't even know who's going.

02:26.906 --> 02:28.794
You might not have to worry about it.

02:29.178 --> 02:30.453
Incoming!

02:30.478 --> 02:33.592
- Cameras on the floor, ladies!
- Incoming!

02:33.617 --> 02:34.906
- Cameras on the floor!
- [Knock on door]

02:34.931 --> 02:35.937
Woman: I'm not ready yet!

02:35.962 --> 02:37.964
Doors are opening! Here they come.

02:37.989 --> 02:39.348
- Rolling!
- Rolling!

02:39.373 --> 02:41.608
Woman: Rolling!

02:42.935 --> 02:45.750
[Chuckles] Pepper: What is it?

02:45.775 --> 02:46.940
Oh, my gosh! Look!

02:47.182 --> 02:49.390
Oh, my God. It is so much drama.

02:49.415 --> 02:50.828
Like they didn't all just spend four hours

02:50.853 --> 02:51.933
getting made up for this.

02:51.958 --> 02:53.653
So hard playing dress up all day.

02:53.678 --> 02:54.761
Look at this!

02:55.479 --> 02:57.069
Holy cow.

02:57.506 --> 03:01.669
"You are cordially invited to
join me at my vineyard in Napa."

03:01.694 --> 03:04.898
"A place that is near
and dear to my heart."

03:04.923 --> 03:07.093
Mary: "This vineyard is
my vision for the future,

03:07.118 --> 03:11.069
and I want to envision
my future wife in it."

03:11.146 --> 03:14.457
It's me. [Chuckles]

03:15.350 --> 03:17.569
Oh, my gosh. That sounds like so much fun.

03:17.594 --> 03:19.794
- Yeah.
- Oh, my.

03:19.819 --> 03:21.118
Oh.

03:21.143 --> 03:23.110
You didn't get one?

03:24.465 --> 03:28.020
Wow. What's the occasion?

03:28.045 --> 03:30.434
You ditched the birds-nest look.

03:30.459 --> 03:31.992
Very charming. Very charming.

03:32.017 --> 03:34.411
Yes, but nothing... nothing's different.

03:36.323 --> 03:38.026
What?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.666
Will you stop? I wear eyeliner sometimes.

03:40.691 --> 03:42.594
- I do.
- Since when?

03:43.051 --> 03:45.047
Hey, wh-what are you doing here?

03:45.072 --> 03:47.485
We're supposed to be scouting
the vineyard with the D.P.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.283
You're looking at him.

03:49.308 --> 03:51.078
Wait a second, you got Carl's job?

03:51.103 --> 03:52.555
- Yeah!
- Stop it!

03:52.580 --> 03:55.858
No, I got it. I mean, whatever you
said to Quinn obviously paid off.

03:55.883 --> 03:57.264
Yeah! [Laughs]

03:57.418 --> 03:59.659
Congratulations. Very happy for you.

03:59.684 --> 04:00.882
Thank you. Let's roll.

04:02.913 --> 04:04.348
[Engine turns over]

04:04.373 --> 04:06.891
Shamiqua: You can stop acting
like you won the lottery.

04:06.916 --> 04:08.885
This date is obviously
just a consolation prize

04:08.910 --> 04:09.705
for the "B" team.

04:09.730 --> 04:11.375
You keep telling yourself that.

04:11.476 --> 04:13.276
I'm heading straight to the final four.

04:13.301 --> 04:15.075
By pulling that nene crap?

04:15.100 --> 04:16.339
So?

04:16.663 --> 04:19.898
You keep fighting the power
and get ready to pack your bags.

04:20.118 --> 04:22.665
How long do you really
think his royal whiteness

04:22.690 --> 04:25.346
is gonna keep around some
black bitch stirring up trouble?

04:25.780 --> 04:29.633
My guess... You're not gonna last the week.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.029
It's gorgeous out here.

04:37.054 --> 04:38.836
Adam: Said <i> without</i> irony.

04:39.053 --> 04:41.815
What's up with you today?

04:47.235 --> 04:49.435
Rachel: Condemned?

04:50.178 --> 04:52.189
Okay, please tell me that this is a joke,

04:52.214 --> 04:53.797
that the real vineyard's somewhere else.

04:53.969 --> 04:55.609
Oh, come on. This is what this show does.

04:55.634 --> 04:57.494
You just work your Hollywood magic.

04:57.970 --> 05:00.991
We don't pull unicorns
out of our asses, okay?

05:01.016 --> 05:02.289
This place is a total disaster.

05:02.313 --> 05:03.455
I know it's a lot to ask,

05:03.480 --> 05:05.270
but if there's anyone I can
trust to make this happen,

05:05.295 --> 05:06.271
it's you.

05:06.383 --> 05:08.034
[Laughing] Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

05:08.059 --> 05:10.760
Did you actually seriously
just try to win me over

05:10.785 --> 05:11.862
with your puppy-dog eyes?

05:11.887 --> 05:12.896
Is that what just happened?

05:12.921 --> 05:14.112
Well, it is in my contract.

05:14.137 --> 05:16.064
Oh, right, and now I see why

05:16.089 --> 05:17.356
you're trying to get the show

05:17.381 --> 05:19.376
- to fix up this hellscape.
- Nothing major.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.060
Just enough to look good on
camera for some publicity.

05:22.085 --> 05:24.876
Meanwhile, "Everlasting" gets
a lovely place for a date.

05:24.901 --> 05:26.284
It's win-win, really.

05:26.309 --> 05:27.202
[Chuckling] No, it's not.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.256
Not for me because I
have to shoot it in a day

05:29.495 --> 05:31.128
<i>and</i> bring it in on budget.

05:31.153 --> 05:33.523
Electricity's off. I'm
gonna need an extra gennie

05:33.548 --> 05:34.621
just to run power to the lights.

05:34.646 --> 05:35.942
Uh, no. Screw the gennie, okay.

05:35.967 --> 05:37.565
I can't afford to do repairs onsite.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.109
I mean, I-I would have to bring in

05:39.134 --> 05:40.445
a full-on construction
crew for this place.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.703
I'll bring some of the guys
out, you know? We'll fix it.

05:41.728 --> 05:43.351
I'm not asking the camera
department to do that.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.367
Just get me power.
They're my guys now, right?

05:45.392 --> 05:46.984
They make me look good, we all look good.

05:47.009 --> 05:49.539
- And I can help out, too.
- Tell you what.

05:49.564 --> 05:52.281
I'll let you know if the
polo ponies get out of hand.

05:53.016 --> 05:54.741
Okay. Thank you.

05:56.603 --> 05:57.851
I hope that guy knows what he's doing.

05:57.876 --> 05:59.273
Listen, that guy is saving your ass.

05:59.298 --> 06:00.734
You should be grateful, okay?

06:00.759 --> 06:03.636
10 grand over budget? Are you insane?

06:03.661 --> 06:05.292
No, the vineyard has crazy potential.

06:05.317 --> 06:06.896
What? All right, you know what?

06:06.921 --> 06:07.983
If you can't get it on budget,

06:08.008 --> 06:09.287
just move it over to the fairman.

06:09.312 --> 06:10.295
They'll pay us for the...

06:10.320 --> 06:12.801
No, we have to shoot there.
You put it in Adam's contract.

06:13.018 --> 06:15.906
I believe this place is what
they call Ratchet, all right?

06:15.931 --> 06:18.415
We could sue him for
breach of contract so fast

06:18.440 --> 06:20.673
that it will snap his pasty English neck.

06:20.698 --> 06:22.298
Quinn, I think I can bring it on budget.

06:22.323 --> 06:23.514
Just give me a chance, okay?

06:23.547 --> 06:24.780
All right. You better. It's fine.

06:24.805 --> 06:26.393
Hi. Um, can I just get you to sign that?

06:26.418 --> 06:27.578
Yeah, no. I got to go.

06:27.603 --> 06:28.986
- Sorry.
- Trouble with mini-me?

06:29.011 --> 06:30.225
Uh, just trying to figure out

06:30.250 --> 06:32.074
how to fix Adam's
vineyard for this weekend.

06:32.099 --> 06:34.592
Fix it? I thought the Cromwells
only own five-star properties.

06:34.617 --> 06:35.858
Well, not this one.

06:35.883 --> 06:38.580
It's trashed. No upkeep for years.

06:38.605 --> 06:39.778
I swear,

06:39.803 --> 06:42.872
her majesty's dumb-ass
has no marketing savvy.

06:42.897 --> 06:44.791
After the show's done, all he has to do

06:44.816 --> 06:48.650
is sell it as Adam Cromwell's
Retreat for Everlasting Romance.

06:48.675 --> 06:52.086
Too bad he doesn't have a
you. You always make it work.

06:52.111 --> 06:54.512
Yeah, too bad for him.

06:54.767 --> 06:56.267
Look, I know you're still pissed

06:56.292 --> 06:57.252
about what happened at the hospital.

06:57.277 --> 07:00.103
I'm not. I'm not.

07:00.222 --> 07:01.788
I'm just done.

07:02.330 --> 07:03.676
This is getting old.

07:03.701 --> 07:05.595
<i>We're</i> getting old.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.652
We have the show,

07:07.677 --> 07:10.654
so let's just leave it at that from now on.

07:10.679 --> 07:12.127
That's crazy.

07:12.537 --> 07:14.451
We're special. We have a thing.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.944
A thing with a wife.

07:17.586 --> 07:19.793
I'm over being played.

07:19.818 --> 07:21.618
I bought you a house.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.503
You can't do this. I made you.

07:27.907 --> 07:32.449
You better get your rundown,
good-for-nothing, user ass

07:32.474 --> 07:34.085
out of my office right now,

07:34.110 --> 07:35.690
or I won't just be done with you.

07:35.887 --> 07:38.156
I will be done <i> here.</i>

07:39.402 --> 07:42.904
Then maybe you'll remember who made who.

07:49.542 --> 07:51.780
[Door slams]

07:55.577 --> 07:57.345
- Is my hair okay?
- Jay: Okay. No, you look great.

07:57.370 --> 07:59.674
So, you seemed pretty jealous that
you weren't chosen for the group date.

07:59.699 --> 08:01.002
Jealous? Well, I guess
it kind of made me want...

08:01.027 --> 08:01.947
Hey, hey, hey. Can I
talk to you for a second?

08:01.972 --> 08:02.947
Uh... sorry.

08:02.972 --> 08:05.150
Hey, you got weed, right? Hook me up.

08:05.175 --> 08:07.801
Uh, no. I don't have any.

08:07.826 --> 08:10.635
A-and I thought you had
some, like, health stuff.

08:10.660 --> 08:11.892
No, I got a weird valve thing.

08:11.917 --> 08:13.346
I could faint. I'm not gonna die.

08:13.371 --> 08:14.992
What do you give a crap for, anyway?

08:16.317 --> 08:18.004
Score us some weed.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.496
Get a limo, maybe a
couple of Thai massages,

08:20.520 --> 08:22.314
we'll drive around, we'll
make a day of it, okay?

08:22.339 --> 08:25.128
You and me? [Asian accent]
Happy ending, long time!

08:25.540 --> 08:28.879
I-I-I just need the power turned
back on for one... one day.

08:28.904 --> 08:31.335
Yeah, we can easily pay the back taxes.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.538
It's not a problem. No! No, no, no.

08:33.563 --> 08:35.534
Please don't... please
don't put me on hold. Ple...

- Oh.

08:38.131 --> 08:39.298
Oh, my God. Okay.

08:40.001 --> 08:40.962
Hey, what's up?

08:40.986 --> 08:42.365
I'm, uh, I'm working on the vineyard.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.587
I just am having a little
bit of trouble with...

08:43.613 --> 08:44.510
Oh, no, the vineyard

08:44.535 --> 08:46.869
was this <i> morning's</i>
Cromwell douchery.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.835
Here's what that twat is
throwing at us this afternoon.

08:49.860 --> 08:50.923
Sexting with his ex?

08:50.948 --> 08:52.278
How did he get a phone?

08:52.660 --> 08:54.315
- Are you kidding me?
- Mnh-mnh.

08:54.340 --> 08:56.267
I cannot believe they didn't
give you the head's up on this.

08:56.292 --> 08:58.179
Well, my contact there is still mad at me

08:58.204 --> 08:59.385
at how I played them last season,

08:59.410 --> 09:01.695
but I didn't realize
that he was gonna screw me

09:01.720 --> 09:03.861
before I had a chance
to buy him a new Rolex.

09:03.886 --> 09:07.080
He's texting her from here?
Okay, I'm sorry, but I thought...

09:07.105 --> 09:08.335
I thought that she broke up with him.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.299
Yes, well, apparently not, okay?
We need to get ahead of this.

09:11.324 --> 09:13.221
And you know what those girls are gonna do

09:13.246 --> 09:15.666
if they find out that he's still
in touch with his Pippa Wannabe.

09:15.691 --> 09:18.424
Yeah, they're gonna chop his balls off
just like our viewers will want to do.

09:18.449 --> 09:20.530
Okay, I will run damage
control with the press,

09:20.555 --> 09:23.025
but I need you to get that sext maniac

09:23.050 --> 09:24.785
to apologize on camera, okay?

09:24.810 --> 09:26.003
He needs to convince the world

09:26.028 --> 09:27.425
that he gives a crap about being here.

09:27.451 --> 09:30.863
- Okay, well, lucky for us, he's a damn good liar.
- Yeah, but seriously?

09:30.895 --> 09:34.878
What does this douchebag not
get about this business, okay?

09:34.903 --> 09:37.003
We are selling true love here!

09:37.390 --> 09:39.487
True love, people!

09:49.016 --> 09:50.351
A little privacy?

09:50.376 --> 09:51.533
What if I was having a wank?

09:51.558 --> 09:53.893
[Sighs] Okay.

09:54.569 --> 09:55.968
Oh, what the hell?

09:55.993 --> 09:58.844
Do you have any idea how much
that jeopardizes the show?

09:59.063 --> 10:00.783
It doesn't. Back home, the tabloids

10:00.808 --> 10:02.198
write about my family all the time.

10:02.223 --> 10:03.428
We ignore it. It goes away.

10:03.453 --> 10:07.291
Okay, well, here in
America, uh, to our audience,

10:07.316 --> 10:08.901
<i>Starcatcher</i> is <i>
The New York Times.</i>

10:08.926 --> 10:10.674
Well, I didn't intend for it to go public.

10:10.699 --> 10:12.566
It really doesn't even
matter what you intended.

10:12.591 --> 10:14.748
Why in the hell would you
start texting with her now?

10:14.773 --> 10:17.197
I was bored. Rog gave me a
phone. What do you want from me?

10:17.222 --> 10:20.369
I want you to stop being such
a little bitch and cop to it.

10:20.838 --> 10:22.820
Apologize to those girls.

10:22.845 --> 10:24.320
[Chuckles] That's not gonna happen.

10:24.345 --> 10:26.079
Right, and why would I expect you

10:26.104 --> 10:27.181
to be responsible for anything?

10:27.206 --> 10:28.915
Your crappy broken-down vineyard,

10:28.940 --> 10:30.635
I mean, your secret hummers from Grace,

10:30.660 --> 10:33.548
and sexting the ex who publicly
humiliated and dumped you.

10:33.574 --> 10:36.041
You know something, Adam? You are right.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.587
You just keep working on your abs

10:38.612 --> 10:40.206
and I will deal with it, okay?

10:40.231 --> 10:42.197
Okay.

10:44.084 --> 10:46.164
[Sighs] What?

10:46.236 --> 10:47.669
Phone.

10:48.931 --> 10:51.514
[Groans]

10:55.121 --> 10:56.970
Rach...

10:56.995 --> 10:58.572
No.

11:00.049 --> 11:01.647
Quinn: All right, get these budgets

11:01.672 --> 11:04.858
over to the network A.S.A.P.
And try <i>Starcatcher</i> again.

11:04.883 --> 11:07.493
Tell them if they don't take my call,

11:07.518 --> 11:08.906
I'm gonna come over there

11:08.931 --> 11:11.690
and shove my manolos up every
one of their slimy asses.

11:11.715 --> 11:13.771
- Woman: Um...
- Go!

11:13.796 --> 11:16.115
- You can go.
- Okay.

11:17.893 --> 11:21.495
[Indistinct shouting]

11:21.981 --> 11:24.215
[Sighs]

11:27.809 --> 11:28.941
[Ringing]

11:28.966 --> 11:32.093
[Clears throat] Bill?

11:32.118 --> 11:33.393
Bill: Quinn. Pleasant surprise.

11:33.418 --> 11:36.310
Yeah, uh, it was a surprise for me, too.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.040
Dinner?

11:40.520 --> 11:41.619
Okay.

11:41.644 --> 11:43.381
Please tell me that that was Napa.

11:43.406 --> 11:45.676
- Please.
- Jay: Thai massage parlor.

11:46.427 --> 11:48.494
Chet... he wants to hang.

11:48.519 --> 11:49.487
But I think this is it.

11:49.512 --> 11:52.008
I think this is my chance to
pitch him my idea for a show.

11:52.032 --> 11:53.884
- Rachel: Really?
- Okay.

11:53.910 --> 11:55.612
Fine, whatever. What's up
with the county manager?

11:55.637 --> 11:58.438
Oh, they're refusing to issue
a permit to turn on the power.

11:58.463 --> 11:59.634
You know, I'm getting nowhere

11:59.659 --> 12:01.876
and Jeremy's working
overtime to prep the site.

12:01.902 --> 12:03.737
Well, Chet's got some pals up there...

12:03.762 --> 12:05.666
some local politician
guy who threw us a party.

12:05.691 --> 12:09.127
Ah! That is great. I will ask Quinn to
have Chet talk to his friend. Thank you.

12:09.152 --> 12:10.775
- Uh, or not.
- Why?

12:10.800 --> 12:13.599
Mommy and daddy are fighting.

12:17.086 --> 12:18.753
[Indistinct conversations]

12:19.365 --> 12:23.197
Sorry. So sorry I'm late.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.551
It's the middle of the season.

12:25.576 --> 12:27.751
You know how it goes. [Chuckles]

12:27.776 --> 12:29.487
Still Grey goose, rocks?

12:29.512 --> 12:31.678
Oh, thanks.

12:31.703 --> 12:34.591
Are you trying to get me drunk and slutty?

12:34.616 --> 12:36.910
[Both laugh]

12:36.935 --> 12:39.662
So, I hope this call means
that you've come to your senses.

12:39.688 --> 12:41.575
I've come for a drink.

12:41.599 --> 12:44.718
I'm not here for your crazy lawsuit.

12:44.744 --> 12:45.976
Well, why not?

12:46.392 --> 12:49.329
Chet stole "Everlasting" from both of us.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.870
You've got no proof. It's
your word against his.

12:52.895 --> 12:55.382
It's really not worth talking about.

12:55.786 --> 12:59.688
Not unless you were to
find your original lookbook.

13:00.382 --> 13:02.358
I haven't seen that thing in years.

13:02.383 --> 13:03.551
[Clears throat]

13:03.576 --> 13:06.782
The lawsuit's a non-starter, Bill.

13:06.807 --> 13:08.780
Just take it or leave it.

13:10.124 --> 13:12.285
Oh, you haven't changed.

13:12.618 --> 13:14.485
I'll give you that.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.412
I've just gotten older.

13:16.437 --> 13:19.081
And smarter. Sexier.

13:19.543 --> 13:20.892
I can almost forgive you

13:20.917 --> 13:23.351
for letting Chet steal you away from me.

13:24.488 --> 13:26.721
I think about you.

13:26.746 --> 13:29.571
- A lot.
- [Sighs]

13:29.596 --> 13:32.164
[Cellphone buzzes]

13:32.189 --> 13:34.256
[Cellphone beeps]

13:35.021 --> 13:36.796
Is it something you can handle?

13:36.821 --> 13:37.353
Rachel: Yeah, but...

13:37.378 --> 13:39.161
good. I'll be back soon.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.652
- [Dog barking]
- Chet: Come on, come on.

13:41.441 --> 13:42.392
Rachel: Chet, hey.

13:42.417 --> 13:43.970
Crazy Ray, Crazy Ray, what up, girl?

13:43.995 --> 13:44.876
Yeah, uh, well, it seems

13:44.901 --> 13:46.907
that I'm having a little
bit of problems in Napa.

13:46.932 --> 13:50.055
It turns out that Adam owes some
back taxes on his property there

13:50.081 --> 13:53.767
and the County is refusing to issue a
permit to turn the electricity back on.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.017
You need me to step in?

13:55.041 --> 13:57.439
Well, I do hear that you
know a politician there,

13:57.464 --> 13:58.369
so I was hoping maybe

13:58.394 --> 14:00.096
you could just, you
know, make a phone call.

14:00.121 --> 14:02.161
Only talking about power for
one day. That's all I'm...

14:02.186 --> 14:04.017
We're all in it together, right?

14:04.042 --> 14:06.075
Right. Yeah. That's right.

14:06.107 --> 14:07.040
Let's see.

14:07.065 --> 14:09.089
My buddy Brooks can take
care of things up in Napa.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.786
Bureaucratic a-holes tend to
listen when the boss speaks.

14:11.811 --> 14:13.862
[Chuckles] That would be great. Thank you.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.509
- Thanks a lot.
- No need to thank me.

14:15.933 --> 14:19.201
We'll find a way for you to pay me back.

14:21.865 --> 14:24.165
- Bo-Bo!
- [Dog barks]

14:24.190 --> 14:25.265
Ladies.

14:25.290 --> 14:27.736
[Laughs]

14:30.732 --> 14:32.265
[Woman giggles]

14:32.290 --> 14:35.579
- Psst. Pepper.
- What?

14:43.340 --> 14:46.874
I probably shouldn't say anything, but...

14:50.046 --> 14:52.380
[Gasps]

14:52.405 --> 14:53.978
I know.

14:54.003 --> 14:57.465
[Indistinct conversations]

14:57.672 --> 15:01.310
Ladies, ladies, who is
ready for group date prep?

15:01.335 --> 15:04.884
Hi. Shamiqua and Pepper, I
don't know why you two are here.

15:04.909 --> 15:06.564
We're here because we want answers.

15:06.589 --> 15:07.503
Okay.

15:07.528 --> 15:09.648
Well, um, I totally understand

15:09.673 --> 15:11.463
that it sucks not to be picked for a date.

15:11.488 --> 15:13.843
- I promise you that there will be other dates.
- No.

15:13.876 --> 15:15.503
We just thought we should
let everyone here know

15:15.528 --> 15:18.475
- who they'd be going on a date with... a big fat liar.
- Mm-hmm.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.354
Woman: Yep. Woman #2: That's right.

15:20.465 --> 15:22.706
You guys, let me just get
to the bottom of this, okay?

15:22.731 --> 15:24.128
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

15:24.153 --> 15:25.285
I will handle it.

15:26.572 --> 15:28.780
They took the bait. Send in Adam.

15:28.805 --> 15:30.060
It's all on him now.

15:30.086 --> 15:33.206
[Chuckles]

15:37.292 --> 15:39.001
<i>And when Athena showed
me, I just thought,</i>

15:39.026 --> 15:40.821
<i>"you know what, Pepper? Those
other girls deserve to know."</i>

15:40.846 --> 15:42.860
<i>There is no way he
can explain this away.</i>

15:42.886 --> 15:44.516
- [Clears throat]
- <i>No way.</i>

15:44.541 --> 15:46.001
All right, you think he's up for it?

15:46.026 --> 15:47.943
Yeah, I think Adam could
charm the panties off a nun.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.241
What's going on with the vineyard?

15:51.477 --> 15:53.439
I had to ask Chet for some help, you know,

15:53.464 --> 15:55.221
with some guy that he knows up in Napa

15:55.246 --> 15:57.082
to get the electricity turned on.

15:57.795 --> 16:00.859
Well, that's a good choice,
but Chet doesn't do favors.

16:00.884 --> 16:03.339
He's gonna want something, and
you'd better be ready for that.

16:04.742 --> 16:07.283
Man: Adam's on the set. We're standing by.

16:07.308 --> 16:09.649
"A" cam on Adam, "B", "C" on girls, please.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.071
Hello, ladies.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.029
So, what do they have planned for us now?

16:13.872 --> 16:15.876
Adam: Is something wrong?

16:15.901 --> 16:17.636
Why don't you ask your fiancée?

16:17.661 --> 16:20.260
Faith: If you're into somebody
else, why don't you just be with her?

16:20.285 --> 16:22.003
- Adam: Uh...
- Instead of all of us?

16:22.028 --> 16:24.043
Okay, I think there's actually...
there's been a mistake.

16:24.092 --> 16:28.173
I'm just gonna see if I can find someone.

16:28.198 --> 16:30.064
I will... I will be right back.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.022
Of course he's gonna try and tell us...

16:32.047 --> 16:33.852
You said you were gonna take care of this.

16:33.877 --> 16:35.874
Yes, and that's exactly
what I'm doing by letting you

16:35.899 --> 16:37.681
- clean up your own mess.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.636
It's not my problem they got their
hands on that stupid magazine.

16:39.661 --> 16:42.036
It absolutely is your problem, and for
once, you're gonna be the one to fix it.

16:42.061 --> 16:43.408
And how the hell am I supposed to do that?

16:43.432 --> 16:46.747
Each one of those girls is your girlfriend

16:46.773 --> 16:49.874
who wants to marry you, but
right now they're pissed.

16:50.140 --> 16:51.598
I mean, listen, if I was your girlfriend,

16:51.623 --> 16:53.478
I would be pissed, too.

16:53.776 --> 16:55.576
What would you say to me?

16:56.087 --> 16:57.505
- If you were my girlfriend?
- Yeah.

16:57.530 --> 16:59.296
What would you say to me?

16:59.960 --> 17:01.536
I really like the eyeliner,

17:01.561 --> 17:03.968
and with a little bit of upkeep,

17:03.993 --> 17:06.023
you could really be something.

17:06.049 --> 17:07.181
[Chuckles]

17:07.655 --> 17:09.305
Now multiply that by 10.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.896
[Groans]

17:10.922 --> 17:12.555
[Rap music playing]

17:13.238 --> 17:14.604
[Laughter]

17:14.628 --> 17:17.272
This is the life, isn't it, Jay?

17:17.298 --> 17:19.249
Yeah. [Chuckles]

17:19.273 --> 17:20.839
Totally, Chet.

17:20.865 --> 17:24.288
You know, you have to
take what life offers,

17:24.523 --> 17:28.849
look it in the eye, and embrace it.

17:28.874 --> 17:30.608
Yeah. I get that.

17:31.413 --> 17:35.024
You know, it's just like
this idea I had for a show.

17:35.049 --> 17:36.080
Uh-huh.

17:36.105 --> 17:38.631
So, it's about blended families, you know,

17:38.656 --> 17:41.537
like a single mom or dad
choosing a new spouse.

17:41.562 --> 17:44.464
But the kids get to vote on it.

17:44.489 --> 17:46.455
They make the decision.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.336
I'm calling it "Family Blender."

17:48.361 --> 17:50.361
[Chuckles]

17:50.386 --> 17:51.813
That's excellent.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.748
Oh, I love it.

17:54.416 --> 17:57.584
Hey. I'm Jay.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.599
Oh, no.

17:59.624 --> 18:01.619
No, yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

18:01.644 --> 18:02.986
That's okay.

18:03.011 --> 18:05.311
Not right now.

18:05.336 --> 18:07.267
[Laughs]

18:07.292 --> 18:11.083
[All shouting]

18:11.108 --> 18:13.370
How could you do something
like this, though?

18:13.395 --> 18:14.561
Girls!

18:14.586 --> 18:17.649
- Girls! Girls!
- Woman: <i> You have something to say?</i>

18:17.674 --> 18:19.739
<i>Give the man a chance to speak.</i>

18:19.765 --> 18:22.454
There's probably a
reasonable explanation, right?

18:22.479 --> 18:23.505
Thank you, Athena.

18:23.530 --> 18:27.633
Um... The truth is, I did
start texting my ex-fiancée

18:27.658 --> 18:28.752
after Rog came to visit.

18:28.777 --> 18:29.846
[Sighs] Woman: There you go.

18:29.871 --> 18:32.288
Adam: Rog reminded me of home,

18:32.313 --> 18:33.641
of the people I grew up with

18:33.666 --> 18:35.498
who think it's silly for
me to be on this show.

18:35.523 --> 18:36.884
They think it's beneath me.

18:36.910 --> 18:40.565
Which... it sounds snobbish, I know.

18:40.590 --> 18:42.037
But I listened.

18:42.735 --> 18:44.629
Because when you're born
into a certain class,

18:44.654 --> 18:46.854
there's only one kind of person
you're supposed to marry...

18:46.879 --> 18:49.053
someone exactly the same as you.

18:49.078 --> 18:54.322
But here, with all of you,
it's so new, so different,

18:54.347 --> 18:56.455
so filled with possibilities

18:56.480 --> 18:58.557
I never could have possibly imagined.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.304
And I suddenly understood

19:00.329 --> 19:02.843
that I could have something
real with one of you,

19:02.868 --> 19:05.708
not just a reflection of my social status,

19:05.964 --> 19:07.784
but a deeper, profound connection

19:07.809 --> 19:09.709
that would be uniquely ours.

19:09.734 --> 19:11.903
And that frightened me.

19:12.381 --> 19:14.872
I wouldn't blame any of
you if you wanted to leave,

19:14.897 --> 19:17.532
although I really hope you don't.

19:17.556 --> 19:20.216
Because I'm sorry for acting like a coward.

19:20.241 --> 19:22.468
I do want something real.

19:22.493 --> 19:26.529
I am truly open to the possibility of love.

19:26.554 --> 19:28.854
And I hope you are, too.

19:32.540 --> 19:35.407
Woman: That's hard.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.076
All: Aww.

19:46.531 --> 19:48.816
It's beautiful, Rachel.

19:48.841 --> 19:52.188
Sometimes you scare me, you're so good.

19:52.213 --> 19:54.148
That was all him.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.748
Take credit where it's due.

19:56.773 --> 19:59.283
Now make sure that that
date that you just saved

19:59.309 --> 20:00.772
isn't a total disaster.

20:02.179 --> 20:04.084
Cut to "A" camera, please.

20:04.109 --> 20:04.956
Man: Copy.

20:04.981 --> 20:07.166
Plotting with your
Little Minion again, huh?

20:07.377 --> 20:09.570
I had a nice little chat with her earlier.

20:09.595 --> 20:11.161
Yeah, that's what I hear.

20:11.186 --> 20:13.253
I hear you left set for dinner.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.336
- Where'd you go?
- A date, actually.

20:16.361 --> 20:18.284
Where'd you go off to with Jay?

20:18.748 --> 20:20.445
Oh, please.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.600
You knew I'd find out.

20:21.625 --> 20:24.259
Everybody saw you and your sluts.

20:24.284 --> 20:25.417
I have to wrap.

20:25.442 --> 20:27.681
We leave for Napa in the morning.

20:27.706 --> 20:30.039
[Snaps fingers] That's right. Napa.

20:30.064 --> 20:32.289
Cynthia's really looking forward to that.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.247
You wouldn't.

20:34.272 --> 20:35.795
Brooks and Kelly want to double date,

20:35.820 --> 20:38.020
congratulate us on the baby.

20:38.794 --> 20:41.611
Maybe you can join us for a drink.

20:44.721 --> 20:48.656
[Sighs]

20:52.588 --> 20:55.115
All right, so you are gonna stroll slowly.

20:55.140 --> 20:57.107
We only have 60 feet of usable space

20:57.132 --> 20:58.999
since your vineyard is a rotting shithole.

20:59.024 --> 21:00.156
- Oh.
- Thanks.

21:00.181 --> 21:02.915
Hi. Uh, cameras up in 30 minutes, people.

21:02.940 --> 21:05.741
I've got eight hours of
useable sunlight to make my day.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.442
Do we have eyes on camera "A"?

21:07.467 --> 21:08.346
Right behind you.

21:08.371 --> 21:10.266
Just clear, people. It's a clear set!

21:10.291 --> 21:11.590
- Thank you!
- [Bell rings]

21:11.615 --> 21:13.649
[Sighs] You let me know when you're ready.

21:13.674 --> 21:15.114
Man: Rolling.

21:15.139 --> 21:16.198
I hope that the person

21:16.223 --> 21:18.223
I choose to spend the rest of my life with

21:18.248 --> 21:22.117
will come to love this
magical place as much as I do.

21:22.142 --> 21:23.245
[Car horn honks]

21:23.270 --> 21:25.419
- [Tires screech]
- What?

21:25.444 --> 21:27.291
[Chuckles]

21:27.316 --> 21:28.817
Hello, mate. How's it going?

21:28.842 --> 21:31.102
What? I have no idea what
fresh circle of hell that is,

21:31.127 --> 21:33.040
but keep rolling just in case.

21:33.066 --> 21:35.379
- Stay behind me. Give me some space. Hi.
- Yeah.

21:35.404 --> 21:37.270
- Hi.
- Rachel, these are some business associates

21:37.295 --> 21:38.801
I met in Saint Tropez earlier this year.

21:38.826 --> 21:41.027
- They just flew in to come see the, um, the vineyard.
- Nice to meet you.

21:41.052 --> 21:42.136
Hi. Oh, nice. That's great.

21:42.161 --> 21:44.839
- Um, will you guys excuse us for one second?
- Sure.

21:44.864 --> 21:46.082
I will bring him right back, I promise.

21:46.107 --> 21:47.060
- Sorry, guys.
- Thanks so much.

21:47.085 --> 21:48.050
One second. I appreciate it.

21:48.075 --> 21:49.886
They're potential investors,
so having the show here

21:49.911 --> 21:51.308
will show them the kind
of publicity I can get.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.755
I don't care!

21:52.781 --> 21:54.058
Do you know what Quinn's gonna do to me

21:54.083 --> 21:55.227
if she sees these guys here?

21:55.253 --> 21:56.238
She's gonna rip my head off.

21:56.263 --> 21:58.658
This is not the "fund
Adam Cromwell show," okay?

21:58.683 --> 22:00.272
This is a straight-up fairy tale.

22:00.297 --> 22:02.432
Rachel, please. I need this.

22:02.490 --> 22:04.757
I can't go back to my father.

22:04.962 --> 22:06.355
I can't see his smug face

22:06.380 --> 22:08.836
when he sees that I have failed again.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.683
I just can't, okay? I can't.

22:12.158 --> 22:13.490
Okay, if I do this for you,

22:13.515 --> 22:15.445
I need you to do something for me.

22:15.470 --> 22:16.969
Yeah, anything.

22:17.390 --> 22:20.129
I need a kiss on this date, okay?

22:20.154 --> 22:23.770
I don't care who it's with, but I want
you to do it in front of the other girls.

22:23.795 --> 22:25.234
That's really what you want?

22:25.258 --> 22:27.392
That's what I really, <i>really</i> want.

22:27.417 --> 22:29.345
Tongue or no tongue?

22:30.496 --> 22:32.529
I want you to sell it.

22:32.906 --> 22:36.018
I want dripping panties.
I want sweaty palms.

22:36.043 --> 22:39.330
I want it intense, and I want it hot.

22:47.605 --> 22:50.239
Thank you.

22:55.728 --> 22:58.662
Woman: All right. I'll grab them.

23:03.521 --> 23:06.532
- Hey.
- Uh, sorry about that.

23:06.557 --> 23:08.515
You know, I thought that
you were producing him.

23:08.540 --> 23:10.574
I didn't know where it was going.
Obviously, nothing's useable.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.207
Okay, well, I don't know
what you think you saw,

23:12.232 --> 23:14.232
but I <i> was</i> just producing him.

23:14.257 --> 23:16.457
No problem. The footage is all yours.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.720
You know?

23:17.745 --> 23:21.056
Lucky I started a new
card, so it's not logged.

23:21.081 --> 23:22.060
Nobody will miss it.

23:22.085 --> 23:23.972
Listen, I want to thank you
for working through the night

23:23.997 --> 23:26.193
to get the place in shape.
It really means a lot.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.882
Well, it means a lot to me
that you had a word with Quinn.

23:29.026 --> 23:32.060
Turns out I don't hate being the boss.

23:32.774 --> 23:35.842
I didn't say anything to Quinn.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.618
What?

23:40.643 --> 23:42.931
Why'd you say that you did?

23:42.955 --> 23:44.474
No, I said I was <i> going to.</i>

23:44.499 --> 23:45.830
And I was, I just... it was, like,

23:45.855 --> 23:47.316
bad timing with everything, and, look,

23:47.341 --> 23:48.573
you got the job on your own.

23:48.598 --> 23:50.189
You didn't even need me to say anything.

23:50.214 --> 23:51.749
You deserve it, obviously.

23:51.774 --> 23:55.262
Yeah. Yeah, no shit, Rach.

24:03.987 --> 24:06.035
Adam: I brought you all here today

24:06.060 --> 24:07.484
to my first official property

24:07.509 --> 24:10.669
because I see in each of you the
potential to be my future wife.

24:10.694 --> 24:13.947
But any wife of mine will need
to be my partner in all things,

24:13.973 --> 24:18.348
including this winery, which
is in need of a signature wine.

24:19.038 --> 24:21.185
You'll be blending different varieties

24:21.210 --> 24:24.010
to discover the one
that's just right for us.

24:24.035 --> 24:26.469
So, have fun.

24:28.346 --> 24:31.019
Pour, pour, pour. I want
those girls drinking.

24:31.044 --> 24:32.127
I want them having fun.

24:32.152 --> 24:34.889
I want them having <i> too</i> much fun.

24:35.805 --> 24:38.578
So, swish it around in your mouth.

24:40.910 --> 24:44.230
Use your senses now to
determine a flavor profile,

24:44.255 --> 24:44.933
we'll call it.

24:44.958 --> 24:47.833
I mean, we had to basically
beg Adam to shoot here.

24:47.859 --> 24:49.285
Normally, we'd pay through the nose

24:49.310 --> 24:51.479
to be in business with a
luxury brand like Cromwell

24:51.503 --> 24:53.462
and shoot in an estate like this.

24:53.488 --> 24:54.348
Like this?

24:54.373 --> 24:57.676
Oh, yeah, this place... this
place is a diamond in the rough.

24:57.701 --> 25:00.580
So, here I'm getting, uh, blackberries?

25:00.605 --> 25:03.739
Honestly, it just tastes
like sour grape juice to me.

25:03.764 --> 25:05.380
But it's so good.

25:05.405 --> 25:07.425
- It's so good.
- Mm-hmm.

25:07.450 --> 25:08.583
[Chuckles]

25:08.992 --> 25:12.193
I think you should be disqualified.

25:12.218 --> 25:14.124
You do this for a living.

25:16.730 --> 25:18.629
You didn't strike me as much of a drinker.

25:18.654 --> 25:20.815
Is this... is this unpleasant for you?

25:20.839 --> 25:21.813
No.

25:21.838 --> 25:23.757
I've had to do a lot of
difficult things in my life.

25:23.782 --> 25:27.717
Spending the afternoon in a
beautiful winery isn't so bad.

25:28.203 --> 25:31.304
Uh, listen, do you want to go for a walk?

25:31.725 --> 25:34.166
Love to.

25:38.416 --> 25:40.049
Delicious.

25:40.074 --> 25:41.551
Where they going?

25:41.576 --> 25:43.071
Well, it's healthier.

25:43.096 --> 25:44.762
- It's the healthier option, for sure.
- Yeah.

25:44.787 --> 25:47.023
- Um...
- Stop, stop.

25:47.815 --> 25:49.748
Adam: You don't drink at all?

25:49.773 --> 25:51.039
Mary: Not at all.

25:51.064 --> 25:52.175
Oh.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.800
Uh...

25:53.825 --> 25:56.768
It's so beautiful.

26:01.151 --> 26:03.529
Way to go, Adam. Good style.

26:03.554 --> 26:05.053
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:09.452 --> 26:12.129
Are we supposed to be watching this?

26:12.154 --> 26:16.189
Excuse me, but that's just tacky.

26:16.432 --> 26:18.845
Quinn: Well, I am glad you liked it.

26:20.326 --> 26:23.261
I look forward to reading the new issue,

26:23.286 --> 26:25.765
hopefully this time with fewer surprises.

26:25.790 --> 26:28.558
[Chuckles] Oh. [Groans]

26:28.583 --> 26:30.190
I'm sure I don't want to know
what <i> that</i> was about.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.878
Oh, no, you don't.

26:32.903 --> 26:34.102
What's this?

26:34.127 --> 26:37.234
Oh, I was, uh, I was just gonna leave them.

26:37.259 --> 26:38.826
Thought you'd be in Napa.

26:38.851 --> 26:41.685
- Busted.
- [Chuckles]

26:41.710 --> 26:44.479
Why don't you come with?

26:44.510 --> 26:47.035
Those girls were ready to eat you alive.

26:47.060 --> 26:48.386
Well, thank you for sticking up for me.

26:48.411 --> 26:49.844
I do appreciate it.

26:50.206 --> 26:54.255
I could keep helping you, have your back,

26:54.280 --> 26:55.936
if you keep me around.

26:55.961 --> 26:57.839
And here I thought you wanted us

26:57.864 --> 26:59.543
to spend the rest of our lives together.

26:59.568 --> 27:00.668
[Scoffs]

27:00.693 --> 27:02.893
You and me in real life...

27:03.637 --> 27:06.079
you wouldn't even know where to start.

27:07.145 --> 27:11.874
You get me to the final four,
and I'll be your wingman.

27:12.442 --> 27:14.297
Deal?

27:14.322 --> 27:17.489
Uh, Athena, I need you back
with the other girls, okay?

27:17.514 --> 27:18.257
Thanks.

27:18.984 --> 27:21.499
Okay, look, Quinn is gonna
be here in 15 minutes.

27:21.524 --> 27:23.192
I can't have her catch those guys on set.

27:23.217 --> 27:24.687
I did what I could, but they got to go.

27:24.712 --> 27:26.288
I haven't had a chance to make my pitch.

27:26.313 --> 27:27.711
That's the whole point of doing this.

27:27.737 --> 27:30.171
- I need more time.
- Chet: Hey, Adam, Adam!

27:30.196 --> 27:32.296
- You met my wife, Cynthia?
- Uh, no.

27:32.321 --> 27:35.499
I don't believe I have.
Hi. Charmed. Oh, wow.

27:35.524 --> 27:37.140
I can see why Chet keeps <i>
you</i> hidden away.

27:37.165 --> 27:40.527
Oh, flattery <i> and</i> the accent.
I smell big ratings this year.

27:40.552 --> 27:42.608
- Chet: This is Brooks, his lovely wife, Kelly.
- Hi.

27:42.633 --> 27:44.880
Brooks is a big deal up here at Napa.

27:45.501 --> 27:48.207
I am a huge fan of your family.

27:48.232 --> 27:50.118
When I found out that you were
going to be this year's suitor,

27:50.143 --> 27:52.126
I just about died, okay.

27:52.151 --> 27:53.968
Guys, hey. Hi.

27:53.993 --> 27:56.098
So, you guys, what if I
take you guys somewhere else

27:56.123 --> 27:58.154
for you to relax, you
know? Does that sound good?

27:58.180 --> 27:59.346
- Yep.
- Good.

27:59.371 --> 28:01.062
Great. Well, give me one second.

28:01.087 --> 28:02.727
Madison, sweetie, special assignment.

28:02.752 --> 28:04.265
I need you to take these
guys to the chapel, okay?

28:04.290 --> 28:07.425
Do not let them leave.
Do whatever it takes.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.761
[ <i>Chuckles</i> ] Pretty good, isn't he?

28:10.786 --> 28:12.473
- I'll say.
- [Laughs]

28:12.498 --> 28:15.023
[Vehicle approaches]

28:16.548 --> 28:19.969
[Indistinct conversation]

28:20.001 --> 28:22.211
What the hell's he doing here?

28:22.792 --> 28:25.526
Chet, it's a long time.

28:25.551 --> 28:27.111
Seriously, this jagoff?

28:27.136 --> 28:29.002
I'm here to do my job, Chet.

28:29.027 --> 28:31.281
Bill's my guest. Deal with it.

28:31.306 --> 28:32.541
You know, you want to get my attention,

28:32.566 --> 28:34.557
you don't have to roll
around in the gutter, Quinn.

28:34.582 --> 28:35.965
Don't talk to her like that.

28:35.990 --> 28:38.165
Are you serious? Wait.

28:38.191 --> 28:41.253
You know, she's actually a grown-up now.

28:41.278 --> 28:42.780
We... we talk like adults.

28:42.805 --> 28:46.855
And, uh, ever since she realized
how much better she could do,

28:47.720 --> 28:49.900
we've been screwing like grown-ups, too.

28:49.925 --> 28:51.796
Oh, it seems like she's, uh, reconsidered.

28:51.905 --> 28:53.718
Oh, well, am I supposed to feel threatened?

28:53.743 --> 28:55.371
- Are you gonna come after me with that big lawsuit?
- Quinn: You know what?

28:55.397 --> 28:56.967
- Can we at least <i> pretend</i> like we're adults?
- You know, it's been eight years.

28:56.992 --> 28:59.476
- You haven't been able to prove a thing.
- You know what you've done.

28:59.501 --> 29:00.919
Yeah, I've built an empire.

29:00.944 --> 29:02.998
How about you, you no-talent hack?

29:03.023 --> 29:06.294
Oh, that's right, you had
a show on the animal planet

29:06.320 --> 29:07.992
that got canceled and you gave up.

29:08.017 --> 29:10.515
Seriously? Can you guys just
keep it in your pants, please?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.315
Oh, that's right. You're
the classy one. All right?

29:12.340 --> 29:13.703
You're throwing up in the alley.

29:13.728 --> 29:16.437
- Rehab, right?
- Yes, I'm a drunk.

29:16.462 --> 29:19.069
But I'm not a liar or a thief or a cheater.

29:19.094 --> 29:20.249
You worthless piece of crap!

29:20.275 --> 29:21.578
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, hey!

29:21.603 --> 29:23.914
Stop it! Stop it!

29:24.436 --> 29:26.593
You look like idiots, all right?

29:26.618 --> 29:28.264
And now we have an audience.

29:28.289 --> 29:30.322
Thank you very much.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.156
You ever show up on my set again,

29:33.181 --> 29:36.240
I'll punch you so hard,
you'll be crapping teeth.

29:39.658 --> 29:41.925
Show's over, people!

29:42.060 --> 29:44.060
Which is why I'm anticipating steady growth

29:44.085 --> 29:45.856
once the initial overhead is paid off.

29:45.881 --> 29:48.472
It's an extremely
attractive investment, guys.

29:48.497 --> 29:49.921
Man: Your producer, was it?

29:49.946 --> 29:51.452
- Rachel, yeah.
- Yes, Rachel.

29:51.478 --> 29:53.734
She is, uh, certainly convincing

29:53.759 --> 29:55.296
about the built-in publicity angle.

29:55.321 --> 29:56.520
Honestly, I don't know

29:56.545 --> 29:57.930
what I'd do without her at this point.

29:57.955 --> 30:01.054
Man: Yeah. All right.
Let me go to my people.

30:01.079 --> 30:04.981
I think they'll leap at the chance to get
in bed with Cromwell hospitality group.

30:05.006 --> 30:07.235
Well, actually, I will be, um,

30:07.260 --> 30:09.227
I will be running this place alone.

30:09.252 --> 30:10.387
But I have full confidence.

30:10.412 --> 30:12.546
I've spent a lot of time
learning by my father's side,

30:12.571 --> 30:13.426
so...

30:13.451 --> 30:14.583
[Sighs]

30:14.793 --> 30:17.500
Look, you may be gaining some fame

30:17.525 --> 30:19.092
with American housewives,

30:19.117 --> 30:21.363
but, mate, you're a
walking tabloid headline.

30:21.388 --> 30:22.757
Adam: Okay, wait. Just hear me out.

30:22.782 --> 30:23.948
Get your father on board.

30:23.973 --> 30:25.870
With him, it's smooth sailing.

30:25.896 --> 30:29.886
You alone, nobody's gonna
take you seriously, mate.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.343
Oh.

30:32.262 --> 30:34.781
Right, yeah. No, of course.

30:34.806 --> 30:38.277
Uh... Sorry to have wasted your time, guys.

30:42.433 --> 30:44.015
Adam, I...

30:44.040 --> 30:45.707
don't.

30:46.213 --> 30:49.214
Who the hell has my Mike?!

30:49.426 --> 30:52.126
- Give me that.
- Anyone?

30:52.858 --> 30:54.958
- Prick.
- What was that?

30:55.593 --> 30:58.360
We don't work for you,<i> mate.</i>

30:59.823 --> 31:01.750
Why is my suitor not on camera?

31:01.775 --> 31:02.938
Look, I was just bringing him in.

31:02.963 --> 31:04.093
Oh, really? Because it looks like

31:04.118 --> 31:06.183
instead of producing the
show I pay you to work on,

31:06.209 --> 31:08.176
you were in there having
a damn cocktail party.

31:08.201 --> 31:10.568
Listen, every moment I spend
producing Adam on or off camera

31:10.593 --> 31:11.856
makes him easier to control.

31:11.881 --> 31:13.937
And you know that I'm the person

31:13.962 --> 31:16.062
who taught you that bullshitty line,

31:16.087 --> 31:19.006
so stop thinking with
your clit and do your job.

31:31.769 --> 31:33.002
[Bell rings]

31:33.027 --> 31:34.732
Okay, let's get you up there.

31:34.757 --> 31:35.779
Thank you.

31:35.805 --> 31:38.328
God forbid I try to walk 20 feet on my own.

31:38.353 --> 31:39.788
Look, I'm sorry about what happened,

31:39.828 --> 31:42.046
you know, but maybe once
your dad sees the show...

31:42.071 --> 31:43.843
The show's a joke, Rachel, and so am I.

31:43.868 --> 31:46.189
Don't you get that?

31:51.148 --> 31:52.929
- You all right?
- Yeah.

31:52.954 --> 31:56.413
Quinn: All right, will somebody
please give Debbie Downer

31:56.439 --> 31:57.769
a royal kick in the ass?

31:57.793 --> 31:58.973
What the hell are you doing with Bill?

31:58.998 --> 32:00.067
All right, whatever the hell I want.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.629
- He's a nobody.
- Not anymore.

32:01.654 --> 32:03.813
He has his life together
and he's not married.

32:03.838 --> 32:06.129
Hey! I know you.

32:06.154 --> 32:07.597
We're the same, you and me,

32:07.622 --> 32:09.363
and Bill's gonna bore you to tears.

32:09.389 --> 32:12.523
I deserve to have a life, Chet.

32:12.548 --> 32:13.973
Let me have it.

32:13.998 --> 32:17.688
Man: Rehearsing in three,
two, one, and Graham.

32:17.713 --> 32:21.136
Graham: <i> Each of you received
an invitation to start the day,</i>

32:21.161 --> 32:23.928
<i>and each of you will receive
an invitation to end it.</i>

32:23.953 --> 32:25.809
All right, "A" camera, on Adam.

32:25.834 --> 32:27.301
- Let's do this.
- Man: Action.

32:27.326 --> 32:28.856
As you can see onstage, ladies,

32:28.881 --> 32:31.134
we have envelopes with your names on them.

32:31.159 --> 32:34.394
Two of these envelopes are empty,

32:34.419 --> 32:41.014
which means for a pair of you,
sadly, it's time to go home.

32:45.722 --> 32:47.488
[Gasps]

32:47.513 --> 32:48.779
Oh, no.

32:48.804 --> 32:51.145
Hell. Hell, no.

32:51.169 --> 32:53.793
We had a deal.

32:53.818 --> 32:55.113
- You lied.
- Whoa.

32:55.138 --> 32:56.990
- Come on.
- You play me, I'll play you.

32:57.015 --> 32:58.037
Come on. Come on.

32:58.061 --> 33:01.083
- Man: Camera 1, follow Athena.
- Yeah, follow me.

33:01.108 --> 33:02.732
Athena. I am <i> not</i> stopping.

33:02.757 --> 33:04.070
I will tell you what happened.

33:04.095 --> 33:05.713
Y'all didn't hear the conversation we had.

33:05.738 --> 33:07.073
I'm gonna tell you!

33:08.985 --> 33:11.714
So, you're willing to step
in for my other investors.

33:11.739 --> 33:14.586
I had a vision for this
place. Total re-branding.

33:14.611 --> 33:18.713
The Everlasting SPA and
Resort... And goldmine.

33:18.738 --> 33:21.866
That sounds, yeah, lovely. It really does.

33:21.890 --> 33:23.953
It's an excellent
investment for the franchise.

33:23.978 --> 33:27.218
Brooks here would hold a 20% share.

33:27.243 --> 33:28.513
Silent partnership.

33:28.539 --> 33:29.852
I'd let you folks run things.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.857
We get Adam his $60 mil,

33:31.883 --> 33:36.250
the three of us have
ourselves a wine-country ATM.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.842
What do you think, honey?

33:37.867 --> 33:40.794
- How's that all sound to you?
- I love it.

33:40.819 --> 33:41.889
[British accent] We'll have scones

33:41.914 --> 33:43.340
and clotted cream for tea.

33:43.365 --> 33:44.292
[Laughter]

33:44.317 --> 33:46.476
[Normal voice] It's gonna be so romantic.

33:46.501 --> 33:48.564
I always let her have the last word.

33:48.589 --> 33:49.764
Makes a marriage work.

33:49.789 --> 33:52.323
- Yeah.
- [Chuckles]

33:54.868 --> 33:58.671
Kelly's got, uh, one last
request just to seal the deal.

33:58.696 --> 33:59.727
What do you say?

33:59.752 --> 34:02.119
Hey, whatever it takes.

34:03.024 --> 34:04.490
Jay: Here we go.

34:04.515 --> 34:08.417
<i>You think they care about
a black woman in America?</i>

34:08.951 --> 34:10.599
<i>Just try coming after me.</i>

34:10.623 --> 34:12.757
<i>I'm gonna tell you everything.</i>

34:12.783 --> 34:16.248
- <i>I'll sue your ass.</i>
- Another black bitch down.

34:16.274 --> 34:17.539
Oh, she's gonna be fine.

34:17.563 --> 34:18.612
She's super smart,

34:18.637 --> 34:20.174
working the race card on the way out.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.710
She's gonna get crazy press.

34:21.735 --> 34:23.060
She's gonna do the talk-show circuit.

34:23.085 --> 34:25.757
[Gasps] She might even
work it into her own show.

34:25.782 --> 34:26.855
[Chuckles]

34:27.148 --> 34:29.382
Yeah, that's the game, right?

34:29.407 --> 34:32.306
She'll be a real hero for my people.

34:33.098 --> 34:35.098
Have you seen Adam?

34:35.123 --> 34:37.889
No, he went off with Chet awhile ago.

34:37.915 --> 34:39.601
Chet?

34:41.300 --> 34:43.594
Oh, God.

34:47.237 --> 34:52.620
[Moaning]

35:31.470 --> 35:33.443
Oh. [Chuckles]

35:33.468 --> 35:35.210
You burning the midnight oil?

35:35.235 --> 35:37.898
Just photoshopping something for Chet.

35:40.337 --> 35:42.537
What is that?

35:42.679 --> 35:44.499
What, you don't know?

35:44.524 --> 35:47.170
Chet and Brooks are
investing in Adam's vineyard,

35:47.195 --> 35:49.028
branding it as "Everlasting."

35:49.053 --> 35:51.190
It's ingenious, right?

35:51.215 --> 35:52.647
<i>I'm</i> your boss.

35:52.672 --> 35:54.442
<i>I'm</i> the one you report to.

35:54.467 --> 35:56.804
Whoa, I was just doing what Chet asked.

35:56.830 --> 35:59.130
Okay, you know what?

35:59.155 --> 36:01.149
You're fired.

36:01.174 --> 36:03.332
Wait, what?

36:03.357 --> 36:06.325
Quinn, I have worked
for you for three years.

36:06.350 --> 36:07.419
What are you talking about?

36:07.444 --> 36:11.002
The one thing I deserve is loyalty, Jay,

36:11.027 --> 36:14.195
and you spent this whole
season kissing the wrong ass.

36:14.220 --> 36:17.118
[Scoffs] You know what?

36:17.143 --> 36:18.287
Y-you go ahead.

36:18.312 --> 36:20.323
You go tell your boss you want me gone

36:20.348 --> 36:23.594
'cause I'm pretty sure Chet
doesn't want a harassment suit

36:23.619 --> 36:26.219
for making me find him hookers and weed.

36:26.244 --> 36:30.281
You know, especially not a
suit from a black, gay man.

36:30.607 --> 36:32.730
I'll finish the season, Quinn,

36:32.755 --> 36:36.890
and after that, I'll be working
for Chet on his new shows.

36:36.915 --> 36:38.281
You'll see.

36:38.306 --> 36:40.219
[Laughs]

36:40.243 --> 36:43.258
You think you're special?

36:43.783 --> 36:45.974
He'll use you up and spit you out,

36:45.999 --> 36:47.465
just like he does everybody else.

36:47.490 --> 36:50.265
Seems to have worked
out pretty well for you.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.088
You're not me.

37:05.345 --> 37:08.012
Adam: There you are.

37:08.557 --> 37:12.834
Saw you as you were leaving,
but I sort of had my hands full.

37:12.859 --> 37:14.803
[Chuckling] Yeah. What was that?

37:14.828 --> 37:16.327
I got my vineyard financed.

37:16.352 --> 37:18.690
Only thing I wanted out of
today, and I made it happen.

37:18.995 --> 37:20.995
Oh, so you're a whore, huh?

37:22.995 --> 37:24.852
Well, at least Kelly enjoyed herself,

37:24.877 --> 37:27.044
which is more than I can say
for the people <i> you</i> screw.

37:27.069 --> 37:28.399
That's something you're proud of, right?

37:28.868 --> 37:30.106
I'm the suitor, Rachel.

37:30.131 --> 37:33.083
I don't remember what pride feels like.

37:33.389 --> 37:34.878
Mm.

37:35.091 --> 37:38.059
My father disowned me, Roger lied to me,

37:38.084 --> 37:40.489
and my ex-fiancée sold me
out to bloy <i> Starcatcher</i>

37:40.514 --> 37:42.474
- for a quick buck and some notoriety.
- How do you know that? How do you exactly know that?

37:42.499 --> 37:43.701
How do I know that? Yeah,
how do you know that?

37:43.726 --> 37:45.237
I just know. How else did it get out?

37:46.265 --> 37:48.173
I can't trust anyone to help me,

37:48.198 --> 37:49.838
so I did what I had to do, okay?

37:49.862 --> 37:51.213
Listen, I can't really believe

37:51.238 --> 37:52.971
that after everything,

37:52.996 --> 37:56.130
after everything the show did
for you today that you would...

37:56.155 --> 37:58.626
[Chuckling] You want me
to trust the show now?

37:58.651 --> 38:00.418
You?

38:00.443 --> 38:04.122
I've watched you make grown women
cry without thinking twice about it.

38:05.026 --> 38:07.634
That's who I am to you, huh?

38:07.660 --> 38:09.803
You're my producer, and this is a game.

38:09.828 --> 38:12.028
Isn't that what you're
telling me all the time?

38:12.053 --> 38:14.520
You're right. I'm your producer.

38:14.545 --> 38:19.573
And right now I'm off the
clock, so get out of my face.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.521
Everlasting Resort and SPA?

38:37.545 --> 38:40.246
Right? This could be amazing.

38:40.271 --> 38:41.660
That was <i> my</i> idea.

38:41.685 --> 38:45.139
And I want you to design the
whole thing any way you want.

38:45.164 --> 38:47.097
I know you're gonna make it perfect.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.658
What did I tell you?

38:48.683 --> 38:51.284
You and me, working together.

38:51.309 --> 38:52.441
Design it?

38:52.466 --> 38:55.005
Like how I designed "Everlasting"?

38:55.030 --> 38:58.095
The show that's raked
in billions of dollars

38:58.120 --> 39:00.047
that I don't even have a stake in,

39:00.072 --> 39:04.279
the show that I could still
be fired from at any minute?

39:04.304 --> 39:06.473
Fired? What are you talking about?

39:06.499 --> 39:09.133
You have taken everything from me.

39:15.416 --> 39:17.783
Not anymore.

39:18.379 --> 39:20.812
[Sighs]

39:21.602 --> 39:24.700
Hey, um, look. I, uh, I messed up, okay?

39:24.725 --> 39:26.340
I lied so I could be the hero.

39:26.365 --> 39:29.068
I just really wanted
you to talk to me again.

39:29.092 --> 39:31.691
With that said, I am sorry.

39:32.544 --> 39:35.378
It's okay.

39:36.746 --> 39:38.246
But I have Lizzie now.

39:38.271 --> 39:40.238
We've got a life together.

39:40.263 --> 39:42.463
Yeah. I got it.

39:44.079 --> 39:46.646
- Hey, Rach?
- Hmm?

39:46.671 --> 39:49.438
Be careful with this guy.
You know, think it through.

39:49.463 --> 39:51.330
What guy?

39:51.589 --> 39:54.063
Right.
