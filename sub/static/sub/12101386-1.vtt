01:53.280 --> 01:55.115
Sir?

02:51.773 --> 02:54.709
Papa! Papa, help!

04:15.556 --> 04:16.891
The mansion was built

04:16.923 --> 04:19.627
by the greatest hat maker
ever known.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.429
Mr. Frederick Williams.

04:22.462 --> 04:25.465
Though he was criticized
for his ungodly parties

04:25.499 --> 04:26.768
by a more prudish set...

04:27.902 --> 04:29.804
- Yes, Henry?
- Why?

04:29.837 --> 04:33.674
Well, they were described
as a drug-fueled orgy.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.611
Now why am I,
a psychology professor,

04:36.644 --> 04:38.546
interested in Mr. Williams?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.982
Because you're freaky.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.519
My interest lies

04:44.552 --> 04:48.488
in the more
animalistic psychology.

04:48.523 --> 04:50.558
Is anyone familiar
with the subject?

04:52.727 --> 04:55.630
- Yes?
- It's the effect of paranormal

04:55.663 --> 04:58.065
on our emotions
and behavior.

04:58.099 --> 04:59.600
Correct.

05:01.002 --> 05:02.703
Are you saying it's haunted?

05:02.737 --> 05:03.938
Maybe.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.074
Now, I will be testing

05:07.108 --> 05:10.545
the effect that paranormal
implications have

05:10.578 --> 05:13.080
on individual behavior.

05:13.114 --> 05:16.416
Now, this estate
is all that's left.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.485
And, of course,
his nickname.

05:20.822 --> 05:22.389
You have a good weekend.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.076
Thank you.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.645
Henry?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.648
All right.

05:56.891 --> 05:58.391
You guys excited about this?

05:58.425 --> 06:00.393
No.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.129
Don't be mean.

06:02.163 --> 06:03.931
I'm just doing it
for extra credit.

06:03.965 --> 06:05.766
And I'm just doing it
to get out of the house.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.969
Parents suck,
am I right?

06:09.203 --> 06:10.571
Why are you?

06:11.906 --> 06:13.074
Same.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.809
Same as both of you.

06:30.024 --> 06:31.458
Henry.

06:33.094 --> 06:34.494
Come on.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.496
I want to get there before dark.

07:34.055 --> 07:36.757
Oh, man. Frederick Williams'
daughter died in that fire.

07:36.791 --> 07:38.659
That's so sad.

07:38.693 --> 07:40.194
Come on.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.712
I need all of your cell phones.

07:57.745 --> 07:58.980
Over my dead body.

07:59.013 --> 08:00.581
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.283
Listen, I need you all

08:02.316 --> 08:04.018
- focused on this study.
- I can't.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.619
I need to check in back home.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.555
It's okay.
I'll be just down the hall

08:07.588 --> 08:08.823
in case of emergencies.

08:08.856 --> 08:09.991
Thank you.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.027
Thank you.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.896
Come on. Cell phones.
Cell phones.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.598
Thank you.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.534
Ha, ha, ha.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.069
Now we can begin.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.507
Hello.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.579
Hello?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.783
Hello?

08:41.054 --> 08:43.190
- Hello?
- Told you it was abandoned.

08:43.224 --> 08:45.826
The door's open.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.697
Hello? Oh, hi.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.832
I'm Professor Hart.
We're here for the weekend.

08:53.334 --> 08:56.103
Okay. Come on in.
Come on.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.809
You're so...
Don't be an idiot.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.077
I was just testing him.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.684
Is that...?

09:10.718 --> 09:11.986
The hatter's daughter.

09:13.254 --> 09:14.922
So morbid.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.861
But come on,
take a look at the ballroom.

09:47.922 --> 09:49.723
Now, to our rooms.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.879
Bon appétit.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.952
I wonder what happened here.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.355
Definitely some messed-up shit.

14:14.388 --> 14:16.957
God, could this house
be any colder?

14:16.990 --> 14:19.159
Well, a lot of people say

14:19.193 --> 14:22.896
that it gets colder
when ghosts are around.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.998
Ooh!

14:25.032 --> 14:26.367
Just think of this all

14:26.400 --> 14:28.603
like a twisted amusement park.

14:28.636 --> 14:31.405
All part of the show.

14:47.221 --> 14:49.089
So pretty.

14:52.426 --> 14:55.530
<i>Now let's talk
a little bit about the study.</i>

14:55.563 --> 14:57.231
<i>I would like for of you</i>

14:57.264 --> 14:59.433
to journal daily.

15:00.635 --> 15:03.170
Write down the good,
the mundane.

15:04.405 --> 15:05.707
Pretty much anything you see.

15:05.740 --> 15:07.542
Even the strange.

15:07.575 --> 15:10.545
We'll try and meet daily
and discuss

15:10.578 --> 15:12.479
what you see
and what you don't see.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.685
Now, how many of you
have tried hypnosis?

15:17.719 --> 15:20.220
I tried it a couple of times.

15:20.254 --> 15:23.090
Hypnosis is a very
powerful tool.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.325
Hypnosis has the ability
to bridge the gap

15:25.359 --> 15:28.395
between the reality
and the spiritual world.

15:30.164 --> 15:31.999
Would you like to try?

15:34.201 --> 15:36.136
I'll actually pass for now.

15:36.170 --> 15:37.337
Henry?

15:39.741 --> 15:42.209
Do I have to go first?

15:42.242 --> 15:44.077
Ian, you go.

15:45.179 --> 15:46.614
Yeah. Go.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.151
Let's get this over with.

16:00.494 --> 16:01.995
Shall we begin?

16:09.504 --> 16:11.405
Listen to every tick.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.042
Feel the weight
of your body.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.410
Your head.

16:17.612 --> 16:18.979
Your limbs.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.450
Let my voice
be your guide.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.056
Let it be your lifeline
connecting you

16:29.089 --> 16:32.025
from the past to the present.

16:33.561 --> 16:35.730
Floating weightless
and unrestrained.

16:38.566 --> 16:40.300
- Can you hear me, Ian?
- Yes.

16:41.803 --> 16:43.538
- Where are you, Ian?
- I'm in my room.

16:44.672 --> 16:46.373
At the orphanage.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.142
- Who's there?
- Kids. Hiding.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.712
From who?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.389
<i>Henry.</i>

17:02.422 --> 17:04.057
<i>You can't hide from me.</i>

17:04.090 --> 17:05.492
The room's empty.

17:06.627 --> 17:07.795
He's in the hall.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.569
The room's empty.
There's nowhere to hide.

17:14.602 --> 17:16.604
Wake him up. Wake him up!

17:16.637 --> 17:18.438
Wake him up! Ian!
Ian! Wake him up!

17:18.472 --> 17:20.608
- Why aren't you waking him up?
- Come back, Ian.

17:32.620 --> 17:33.821
What?

17:38.560 --> 17:40.562
You were in an orphanage?

17:47.434 --> 17:49.537
What did I say?

17:54.174 --> 17:55.677
Are you okay?

17:58.880 --> 18:00.682
Ian.

18:00.715 --> 18:02.215
Ian. Ian.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.551
I...

19:00.708 --> 19:02.409
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

19:06.914 --> 19:09.584
<i>Where are you, Ian?</i>

19:12.654 --> 19:16.557
<i>You can't hide from me.</i>

19:19.560 --> 19:22.697
<i>Stop waving your hands.</i>

20:34.602 --> 20:36.904
Dad, wait.

20:44.712 --> 20:46.313
Dad, wait.

20:57.658 --> 20:59.426
Morning, Henry.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.661
Good morning.

21:00.695 --> 21:02.930
Would you like some tea?

21:02.964 --> 21:05.066
Yeah. Sure.

21:05.099 --> 21:06.567
Thank you.

21:08.636 --> 21:10.571
I've never been much
for coffee.

21:10.605 --> 21:11.973
Me neither.

21:12.006 --> 21:14.441
But I adore tea.

21:20.081 --> 21:21.414
Thanks.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.921
Whoo. Yeah, yeah.

21:26.954 --> 21:30.558
I... I don't really
drink tea either.

21:30.591 --> 21:31.959
It's good.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.862
Did you sleep well?

21:40.568 --> 21:41.936
No. I...

21:43.971 --> 21:45.807
I keep having this...

21:45.840 --> 21:47.909
it's a reoccurring
nightmare.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.847
I understand.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.615
I struggle as well.

21:57.518 --> 21:58.686
These...

22:00.855 --> 22:02.489
These...

22:04.592 --> 22:06.326
These nightmares,
they're...

22:07.427 --> 22:08.596
they're real.

22:09.931 --> 22:12.066
They're really real.

22:15.937 --> 22:17.470
What if...

22:17.505 --> 22:19.406
What if they're not
my imagination?

22:23.511 --> 22:25.345
I don't deserve
to be alive.

22:28.950 --> 22:30.450
I can help you, Henry.

22:34.188 --> 22:35.623
Okay.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.726
Okay.

22:47.134 --> 22:49.537
<i>You can't hide from me.</i>

22:52.640 --> 22:53.908
Dad?

23:24.005 --> 23:25.640
Dad?

23:46.160 --> 23:47.528
Hm.

24:32.540 --> 24:33.741
Chelsey?

24:33.774 --> 24:36.077
Oh. Hi, Professor.

24:36.110 --> 24:37.578
You okay?

24:37.611 --> 24:41.115
Yeah. Just the clock
startled me.

24:41.148 --> 24:42.850
Are you ready for your session?

24:44.552 --> 24:46.087
Yes.

25:02.069 --> 25:03.204
Ow.

25:16.584 --> 25:17.885
Oh, God.

25:17.918 --> 25:21.122
<i>Stop biting your nails.</i>

25:35.202 --> 25:36.937
Would you like some tea?

25:36.971 --> 25:38.806
No, thanks.

25:38.839 --> 25:40.574
Shall we begin?

25:40.608 --> 25:42.143
Mm-hm.

26:19.947 --> 26:22.183
Stop. Stop.

26:28.856 --> 26:29.990
What?

26:30.024 --> 26:31.959
Sorry, I...

26:31.992 --> 26:33.928
I wasn't looking at you.

26:37.898 --> 26:40.301
No, we're being
kind of rude.

26:42.236 --> 26:43.938
All right.

26:43.971 --> 26:45.773
I'm officially bored.

26:46.941 --> 26:48.642
What should we do?

26:48.676 --> 26:49.877
We can play a game.

26:49.910 --> 26:51.378
Poker?

26:51.412 --> 26:54.748
- I like hearts.
- Yeah. No, thanks.

26:56.717 --> 26:57.952
Maybe we shouldn't
be touching those.

26:57.985 --> 27:00.589
Ugh! What are you afraid of?

27:04.959 --> 27:06.927
Dude, stop it, man.

27:08.362 --> 27:09.697
Stop.

27:10.798 --> 27:13.067
Stop.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.169
This would look
a lot better on you, babe.

27:15.202 --> 27:16.904
- Let me see it.
- Try it on.

27:21.342 --> 27:24.645
Huh. Down the rabbit hole.

27:34.121 --> 27:35.389
Ian.

27:37.024 --> 27:38.225
Ian, that's not funny.

27:40.294 --> 27:42.129
Ian, stop.

27:42.163 --> 27:44.231
Seriously, stop.

27:44.265 --> 27:47.234
Take it off! Take it off, guys!

27:47.268 --> 27:50.171
Oh, my God! Take it off! Ian!

27:54.074 --> 27:56.710
You're such a dick.

27:56.744 --> 27:59.313
That's not funny
after that hypnosis shit.

27:59.346 --> 28:02.116
- They thought it was funny.
- It was pretty funny.

28:02.149 --> 28:04.185
It was pretty good.

28:05.219 --> 28:06.754
Fine.

28:06.787 --> 28:08.222
What about this?

28:08.255 --> 28:10.024
A fancy funeral.

28:10.057 --> 28:11.258
Yes, girl.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.228
Give me that one.

28:16.330 --> 28:18.199
I would like a milk latte,
please.

28:18.232 --> 28:20.935
- Voilà.
- <i>Danke.</i>

28:22.870 --> 28:24.004
Ooh, la, la.

28:24.038 --> 28:25.806
<i>Enchante.</i>

28:25.839 --> 28:28.909
Fortune and glory, kid.

28:28.943 --> 28:30.778
Fortune and glory.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.115
You want that gun?
Pick it up.

28:35.149 --> 28:37.151
I wish you would.

28:42.356 --> 28:46.727
What? You know Indiana Jones
but you don't know John Wayne?

28:48.028 --> 28:49.396
Who's that?

28:51.899 --> 28:53.100
Whatever.

28:55.936 --> 28:57.204
Awkward.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.175
Ian...

29:03.344 --> 29:05.846
Ian. Ian, hand me that.

29:05.879 --> 29:08.382
- Look at you.
- Put it on me.

29:09.551 --> 29:11.252
- Yeah.
- Anything for you.

29:15.055 --> 29:16.190
Sorry.

29:17.925 --> 29:19.827
You ready to go for a ride?

29:19.860 --> 29:21.028
I'm ready.

29:21.061 --> 29:22.196
Saddle up.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.836
My husband, he slipped.

29:31.038 --> 29:33.440
I feel for you so much.

30:29.129 --> 30:30.397
Hey, guys?

30:34.034 --> 30:35.202
Hm?

30:41.175 --> 30:42.443
Check your hats.

30:54.388 --> 30:56.323
Ah!

30:56.357 --> 30:58.992
Are they real?

31:04.632 --> 31:06.300
Let's do something else.

31:25.419 --> 31:27.087
There's got to be something.

31:34.562 --> 31:37.064
You guys aren't looking for...?

31:37.097 --> 31:38.932
Booze? Yeah.

31:38.966 --> 31:42.236
Come on. Why not?

31:47.609 --> 31:49.309
Hey, babe?

31:49.343 --> 31:51.245
I think I found something.

31:53.981 --> 31:55.583
I think it's a wine cellar.

31:55.617 --> 31:58.252
God, I love you.

31:58.285 --> 32:00.688
And flashlights.

32:00.722 --> 32:02.489
You're a goddess.

32:02.524 --> 32:04.391
A queen among princesses.

32:04.425 --> 32:05.660
It's kind of dark.

32:14.034 --> 32:15.703
You guys coming?

32:17.572 --> 32:19.106
You guys are pathetic.

32:21.743 --> 32:23.444
- I'll go.
- Hell, yeah.

32:23.477 --> 32:26.146
I'm definitely going.

32:27.347 --> 32:28.482
Thanks.

32:30.117 --> 32:31.385
Fine.

32:53.440 --> 32:54.709
That's not...

32:57.311 --> 32:59.379
<i>Papa. Papa.</i>

32:59.413 --> 33:01.048
<i>I can see, Papa.</i>

33:11.291 --> 33:12.459
Jackpot.

33:12.493 --> 33:13.695
Oh!

33:14.762 --> 33:17.264
Ow. Gross.

33:22.169 --> 33:23.671
Oh!

33:23.705 --> 33:26.073
- What was that?
- Definitely not a rabbit.

33:26.106 --> 33:27.374
Not funny.

33:37.519 --> 33:38.720
That's odd.

33:38.753 --> 33:40.420
What?

33:40.454 --> 33:42.222
- No labels.
- You guys about finished?

33:42.256 --> 33:47.227
That's definitely some really
strong moonshine shit.

33:47.261 --> 33:48.596
They bottle it here.

33:48.630 --> 33:51.265
Guys, seriously?

33:56.370 --> 33:59.139
Screw this.

34:02.610 --> 34:04.512
Hey, we were just
looking around.

34:04.546 --> 34:06.548
We didn't do anything wrong.

34:12.754 --> 34:14.221
We're going right now...

34:14.254 --> 34:15.556
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:15.590 --> 34:17.224
What the hell, man?

34:21.563 --> 34:23.463
Try me! Come on!

34:23.496 --> 34:25.399
Try me.

34:31.405 --> 34:32.840
Don't even do that.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.518
It's okay. It's okay.

34:43.551 --> 34:45.719
He wasn't going to do anything
with us, I promise.

34:45.753 --> 34:47.487
You good?
Because I'll kill him.

34:48.623 --> 34:49.857
It's fine.

34:49.891 --> 34:51.559
He's halfway there.

34:51.592 --> 34:53.695
Just... chill out.

34:53.728 --> 34:55.630
For a second there
I thought we might die.

34:55.663 --> 34:57.532
- I could tell, wuss.
- Ian.

34:59.232 --> 35:00.467
Come on.

35:03.671 --> 35:05.238
- At least we got this.
- Yeah.

35:05.272 --> 35:07.575
And this.

35:07.609 --> 35:08.810
Clutch.

35:08.843 --> 35:10.578
Quiet guy trying to get lit?

35:13.514 --> 35:16.784
Guys, I have to show you
something.

35:22.489 --> 35:24.491
The Frederick Williams estate.

35:26.961 --> 35:28.763
What a fox.

35:28.796 --> 35:30.732
- Ooh!
- Stop it.

35:32.466 --> 35:34.569
Dude loved hats.

35:34.602 --> 35:36.403
And parties.

35:36.436 --> 35:39.172
Man, I wish I could go
to one of those.

35:39.206 --> 35:41.643
But check this out.

36:15.677 --> 36:16.911
Papa.

36:19.881 --> 36:22.315
- Emma.
- I couldn't sleep, Papa.

36:22.349 --> 36:23.718
More nightmares?

36:25.019 --> 36:27.655
Go to your room.
I'll be up soon.

36:31.592 --> 36:35.228
Frederick Williams'
daughter died in that fire.

36:49.711 --> 36:51.378
Eternal night.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.781
Eternal life.

36:55.550 --> 36:57.284
Praise be.

36:57.317 --> 37:00.755
Eternal night. Eternal life.

37:00.788 --> 37:02.355
Praise be.

37:02.389 --> 37:05.760
<i>Eternal night. Eternal life.</i>

37:05.793 --> 37:07.360
<i>What is that?</i>

37:08.563 --> 37:09.897
A sculpture.

37:11.899 --> 37:13.901
Give it a rest
and dance with me.

37:13.935 --> 37:15.469
Hm?

37:15.503 --> 37:17.337
Go.

37:22.076 --> 37:24.712
I just tripped!

37:31.652 --> 37:32.920
No, you'll drink
the whole thing.

37:32.954 --> 37:34.454
Mm, honey...

37:37.525 --> 37:39.594
Stop.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.301
That is so gross.

37:48.335 --> 37:50.004
Barely any.

37:52.874 --> 37:54.407
You want some?

37:57.645 --> 38:00.047
That's bad.

38:00.081 --> 38:01.448
Stop.

38:01.481 --> 38:02.617
Mm.

38:05.418 --> 38:09.857
You know, he's not as bad
as he seems.

38:09.891 --> 38:11.726
I never said he was bad.

38:11.759 --> 38:13.828
Oh, no, I'm just...

38:13.861 --> 38:17.532
just... I took a bio class
with Ian last semester,

38:17.565 --> 38:20.034
and, you know, he's...

38:21.602 --> 38:23.336
I mean...

38:23.370 --> 38:24.739
Yeah, he's a little loud.

38:27.108 --> 38:29.476
You fell again.

38:31.045 --> 38:32.580
That's evident.

38:34.447 --> 38:35.683
Help me up.

38:37.518 --> 38:39.020
But he's a good person.

38:39.053 --> 38:42.924
He definitely has
some anger issues, but...

38:44.692 --> 38:46.459
we all have something.

38:46.493 --> 38:47.795
Read it to me.

38:47.829 --> 38:49.063
Read it to me.

38:51.165 --> 38:52.567
Mm!

38:55.703 --> 38:57.638
My dad's dying of cancer.

39:01.441 --> 39:04.679
I worry he'll die
every time I leave the house.

39:06.747 --> 39:09.684
I'm sorry, Chelsey.
I...

39:09.717 --> 39:11.752
I didn't know.

39:13.788 --> 39:17.758
I worry so much,
I started seeing him everywhere.

39:20.194 --> 39:23.631
Earlier, I could have sworn
I saw him in the hallway.

39:26.868 --> 39:29.570
He relies on me so much.

39:29.604 --> 39:30.872
Yet here I am...

39:32.039 --> 39:33.641
chasing ghosts.

39:37.078 --> 39:38.779
It's only a few days, right?

39:41.148 --> 39:42.984
That's what he says too.

39:45.953 --> 39:47.889
What if it's not,
you know?

39:49.957 --> 39:52.526
What if something happens?

39:55.563 --> 39:57.865
I lost my mom
when I was very young.

40:00.201 --> 40:02.203
Oh, not all of it!

40:02.236 --> 40:04.105
Give me that!

40:07.008 --> 40:08.643
Do you believe in ghosts?

40:11.913 --> 40:14.115
I have to believe there's
a tether to my parents

40:14.148 --> 40:17.417
before I'm left here alone.

40:19.754 --> 40:20.922
Yeah.

40:22.590 --> 40:23.758
Yeah.

40:25.026 --> 40:26.694
What about you?

40:26.727 --> 40:27.895
Hm?

40:29.230 --> 40:31.431
What's your something?

40:37.939 --> 40:39.674
You guys got any left?

40:40.708 --> 40:42.510
No, we're all out, man.

40:44.612 --> 40:45.780
Wow.

40:45.813 --> 40:47.615
Shit.

40:50.184 --> 40:51.752
Drink some.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.622
It's all yours.

40:54.655 --> 40:55.957
Okay.

41:04.799 --> 41:06.133
Are you good?

41:06.167 --> 41:07.668
Yeah.

41:07.702 --> 41:10.738
I feel... I feel great,
actually.

41:12.807 --> 41:14.175
Why?

41:14.208 --> 41:16.644
Do you feel good?

41:16.677 --> 41:17.845
- I'm good.
- Good.

41:19.113 --> 41:20.881
Do you want to go
for a walk?

41:20.915 --> 41:22.550
Oh...

41:24.919 --> 41:26.921
Just a walk.

41:26.954 --> 41:28.889
Yeah. That's cool.
Yeah.

41:30.124 --> 41:31.859
- Sure.
- Let's go.

41:34.261 --> 41:37.098
I think I drank
a little too much.

41:37.131 --> 41:39.567
Yeah. Me too.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.168
Good night, lovebirds.

41:44.038 --> 41:45.573
Good night, guys.

41:45.606 --> 41:47.708
So you won't put the hands...

41:47.742 --> 41:49.043
Yes.

41:49.076 --> 41:50.311
Push.

41:50.344 --> 41:51.879
Oh, okay.

41:51.912 --> 41:53.848
Now you're a teacher.

41:55.349 --> 41:57.852
So, what did he say?

41:57.885 --> 41:59.253
He was like,

41:59.286 --> 42:01.055
"Chelsey's going very hard."

42:01.088 --> 42:03.624
And I was like, "No, no, no."

42:03.657 --> 42:05.926
And then he was like,
"Stop it.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.996
Stop it, because you won't
control yourself."

42:13.601 --> 42:15.569
Help. Help.

42:15.603 --> 42:17.104
Mia?

42:20.307 --> 42:21.976
Henry?

42:23.010 --> 42:24.111
What happened?

42:26.881 --> 42:28.716
Did you see anybody?

42:28.749 --> 42:30.618
What? Come on.

42:30.651 --> 42:32.753
- Nothing.
- Let's go.

42:39.760 --> 42:41.062
Help me up.

43:02.416 --> 43:03.884
Spin me.

43:03.918 --> 43:06.220
No. Spin me.

43:32.680 --> 43:33.948
Let's go to bed.

44:00.007 --> 44:01.242
Eternal night.

44:02.843 --> 44:04.912
Eternal life.

44:04.945 --> 44:06.147
Papa.

44:23.063 --> 44:24.198
Miss me?

44:24.231 --> 44:26.300
Whoa.

44:27.768 --> 44:29.737
Thought you weren't real
at first.

44:29.770 --> 44:31.906
Oh, yeah? I thought you didn't
believe in ghosts, tough guy.

44:31.939 --> 44:35.709
No, but I believe
in creepy old men

44:35.743 --> 44:37.711
who hit on my girlfriend.

44:37.745 --> 44:39.280
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

44:39.313 --> 44:40.447
Don't be jealous.

44:40.481 --> 44:42.316
I'm not jealous.

44:48.923 --> 44:50.424
I like this side of you.

44:50.457 --> 44:52.126
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

44:54.795 --> 44:56.163
Do I look sexy?

44:56.197 --> 44:59.266
Yeah, baby.
You always look sexy.

44:59.300 --> 45:02.236
Uh-uh. I'm in charge.

45:17.117 --> 45:20.020
What is this,
a chastity belt?

45:34.536 --> 45:36.103
Careful.

45:40.808 --> 45:42.076
Not so hard.

45:44.211 --> 45:46.280
What the hell?

46:00.427 --> 46:02.329
What the hell
is your problem?

47:19.674 --> 47:21.442
What happened? Mia!

47:21.475 --> 47:22.910
Mia, Mia...

47:25.913 --> 47:28.015
Mia! Mia?

47:29.651 --> 47:32.152
Why isn't anybody
calling somebody?

47:32.186 --> 47:34.088
Call somebody!

48:24.405 --> 48:26.407
I'm so sorry.

48:28.008 --> 48:29.544
I'm so sorry, Emma.

48:30.678 --> 48:33.515
I'm so sorry.

48:35.617 --> 48:37.217
Professor?

48:37.251 --> 48:38.653
Come in.

48:42.557 --> 48:44.559
Hey, Henry. Have a seat.

49:19.594 --> 49:20.728
Great.

50:59.694 --> 51:01.829
Are you okay?

51:02.830 --> 51:04.699
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

51:06.466 --> 51:08.670
Hey, I'm sorry
about last night.

51:08.703 --> 51:11.238
I drank way too much.

51:11.271 --> 51:13.841
What are you talking about?

51:15.643 --> 51:17.812
When you came over
to my room.

51:19.647 --> 51:21.516
I never went
to your room.

51:23.618 --> 51:26.119
You did when everyone
went to sleep.

51:27.522 --> 51:30.357
Babe, I can't do practical jokes
right now.

51:30.390 --> 51:32.860
I feel like I'm going
to throw up.

51:32.894 --> 51:36.129
Whatever it was,
I'm sure it's fine.

51:37.431 --> 51:39.166
Okay. Yeah.

51:40.334 --> 51:41.636
I'll see you downstairs.

51:42.704 --> 51:44.104
Okay.

51:46.541 --> 51:48.375
Hey.

51:48.408 --> 51:50.310
It's okay.

52:03.691 --> 52:05.693
<i>See, you guilt
is full right now.</i>

52:05.727 --> 52:07.461
And it's going to get empty.

52:07.494 --> 52:09.697
And at that point,
you'll return to balance.

52:13.200 --> 52:15.168
Oh, sorry.

52:15.202 --> 52:17.304
No, we're almost done.
Come on in.

53:09.590 --> 53:10.958
<i>Henry.</i>

53:32.379 --> 53:33.581
<i>Come on, Henry.</i>

53:40.287 --> 53:41.622
<i>Come on, Henry.</i>

54:03.443 --> 54:05.445
<i>Henry, come here.</i>

54:10.551 --> 54:12.019
<i>Come on.</i>

54:53.661 --> 54:54.862
Henry?

54:58.733 --> 55:00.300
Henry?

55:04.572 --> 55:05.807
Henry?

55:15.415 --> 55:16.818
Henry?

55:19.452 --> 55:20.822
Henry?

55:21.889 --> 55:23.658
What happened?

55:23.691 --> 55:25.358
Are you okay?

55:26.393 --> 55:27.595
Huh?

55:27.628 --> 55:28.996
She pulled me under

55:29.030 --> 55:30.865
Who?

55:30.898 --> 55:32.066
What?

55:33.433 --> 55:35.870
Henry, let's go back inside.

55:35.903 --> 55:37.470
Hm?

55:37.505 --> 55:39.874
Come on, let's go back
to the house.

55:46.781 --> 55:49.116
There's something wrong
with this place,

55:49.150 --> 55:51.484
and I'm going
to figure it out.

56:31.959 --> 56:33.628
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

56:47.942 --> 56:50.611
<i>Where are you, Ian?</i>

56:55.182 --> 56:57.752
<i>You can't hide from me.</i>

57:46.934 --> 57:48.970
<i>Stop biting your nails!</i>

57:50.137 --> 57:51.973
Why would a good man

57:52.006 --> 57:55.209
want a disgusting woman like you
for a wife?

57:57.578 --> 57:58.779
I'm scared.

58:00.915 --> 58:04.218
Is that butter on your plate?

58:04.251 --> 58:05.720
Yes, Mother.

58:05.753 --> 58:09.957
You're an uncivilized
fat pig!

58:09.991 --> 58:13.728
No man will ever love you.

58:13.761 --> 58:15.896
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

58:17.732 --> 58:19.533
Val!

58:21.669 --> 58:23.137
Hey, hey.

58:23.170 --> 58:24.572
What did you see?

58:31.012 --> 58:32.680
I'm going to go to sleep.

01:00:46.447 --> 01:00:48.149
<i>No man will ever love you.</i>

01:00:49.316 --> 01:00:51.852
<i>You'll never be good enough.</i>

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.729
<i>You'll never be beautiful.</i>

01:04:07.314 --> 01:04:08.882
Ian!

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:10.984
Ian, wake up! Wake up!

01:04:11.018 --> 01:04:12.319
Ian!

01:04:12.353 --> 01:04:14.254
Please, please. please.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.576
Ian! Help...

01:05:15.115 --> 01:05:16.584
Val?

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.087
Val?

01:06:34.495 --> 01:06:37.431
<i>Where are you, Ian?</i>

01:06:37.464 --> 01:06:40.735
You can't hide from me.

01:07:10.832 --> 01:07:12.332
<i>Eternal life.</i>

01:07:12.366 --> 01:07:14.101
<i>Praise be.</i>

01:07:14.134 --> 01:07:17.204
<i>Eternal night. Eternal life.</i>

01:07:17.237 --> 01:07:19.273
<i>Praise be.</i>

01:07:20.274 --> 01:07:21.408
<i>Eternal night.</i>

01:07:21.441 --> 01:07:24.579
<i>Eternal life. Praise be.</i>

01:07:25.813 --> 01:07:29.182
<i>Eternal night. Eternal life.</i>

01:07:29.216 --> 01:07:31.218
<i>Praise be.</i>

01:07:31.251 --> 01:07:32.820
<i>Eternal night.</i>

01:07:32.854 --> 01:07:36.524
<i>Eternal life.
Praise be.</i>

01:07:36.558 --> 01:07:39.861
<i>Eternal night. Eternal life.</i>

01:07:39.894 --> 01:07:42.095
<i>Praise be.</i>

01:07:42.129 --> 01:07:45.567
<i>Eternal night.
Eternal life.</i>

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.236
<i>Praise be. Praise be.</i>

01:10:28.062 --> 01:10:29.564
Henry?

01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:34.836
Henry?

01:10:44.679 --> 01:10:47.380
Henry? Henry?

01:10:49.349 --> 01:10:50.585
Good morning.

01:10:51.719 --> 01:10:53.755
Good morning, Professor.

01:10:54.822 --> 01:10:55.990
Sit.

01:10:59.392 --> 01:11:01.062
Some tea?

01:11:01.095 --> 01:11:02.496
Yes.

01:11:07.735 --> 01:11:09.369
Thank you.

01:11:11.371 --> 01:11:13.641
So, where's Ian and Val?

01:11:13.674 --> 01:11:16.343
Ian left last night.

01:11:16.376 --> 01:11:18.079
He wasn't feeling well,

01:11:18.112 --> 01:11:21.048
so I recommended he go home,
and asked Val to go with him.

01:11:21.082 --> 01:11:22.583
Oh.

01:11:27.454 --> 01:11:29.389
Oh.

01:11:29.422 --> 01:11:30.725
Okay.

01:11:37.131 --> 01:11:38.633
Professor...

01:11:38.666 --> 01:11:41.334
I would like
to use my phone

01:11:41.368 --> 01:11:43.938
just, you know,
to make a phone call.

01:11:44.939 --> 01:11:46.607
You should enjoy your final day.

01:11:46.641 --> 01:11:49.544
You'll be reunited
with your father real soon.

01:11:51.411 --> 01:11:52.947
Are you feeling okay?

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.949
Of course.

01:11:58.786 --> 01:12:00.588
Will you excuse me?

01:12:06.127 --> 01:12:07.662
Your tea's getting cold.

01:12:09.597 --> 01:12:12.867
Can you just excuse me
for a minute?

01:12:24.846 --> 01:12:26.379
Who are you?

01:12:29.984 --> 01:12:32.520
Henry, we got to leave
this place.

01:12:32.553 --> 01:12:33.855
I think the caretakers

01:12:33.888 --> 01:12:35.957
are poisoning us
and Professor Hart.

01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:37.658
Come on.

01:12:37.692 --> 01:12:40.528
Look, I'm seeing things too.

01:12:40.561 --> 01:12:42.663
I saw burnt people
in the ballroom.

01:12:42.697 --> 01:12:45.933
I saw this strange hat factory
with a bunch of chemicals.

01:12:45.967 --> 01:12:47.735
Come on, Henry.

01:12:47.768 --> 01:12:49.637
At first I thought
they were spirits,

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:51.939
but now I think
they're hallucinations.

01:12:51.973 --> 01:12:54.809
I know you're scared
of your dad dying, okay?

01:12:54.842 --> 01:12:57.144
And if you are, then leave.
But I want to stay.

01:12:57.178 --> 01:12:59.814
I know you want
to reconnect with Mia, but...

01:12:59.847 --> 01:13:02.550
Henry? Henry, run!

01:13:37.084 --> 01:13:38.719
Chelsey, slow down!

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.722
- Slow down!
- Ah!

01:13:48.562 --> 01:13:50.097
Hold on, hold on.

01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:53.167
I'm gonna try...
I'm gonna try opening it, okay?

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:55.569
We need help!

01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:56.971
Somebody help us!

01:14:02.109 --> 01:14:04.545
Please!

01:14:21.028 --> 01:14:22.563
Chelsey!

01:14:26.934 --> 01:14:29.070
- Where am I?
- You're passed out.

01:14:29.103 --> 01:14:31.605
You're in my office, Henry.

01:14:31.639 --> 01:14:33.541
What?

01:14:33.574 --> 01:14:34.842
Where's Chelsey?

01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:38.079
You're lucky I found you
when I did.

01:14:38.112 --> 01:14:40.181
She lost a lot of blood.

01:14:40.214 --> 01:14:42.016
Is she okay?

01:14:42.049 --> 01:14:44.552
I sent her to the hospital
to get stitches,

01:14:44.585 --> 01:14:46.787
and she's at home
recovering now.

01:14:47.855 --> 01:14:49.590
I need to apologize, Henry.

01:14:49.623 --> 01:14:53.094
I didn't think bringing you here
would push you this far.

01:14:53.127 --> 01:14:55.529
But you're strong.

01:14:55.563 --> 01:14:59.567
And I'm going to help you
release all that water.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.702
and return to balance.

01:15:05.573 --> 01:15:07.641
Do you trust me, Henry?

01:15:17.618 --> 01:15:21.956
Feel the pressure
leaving your body.

01:15:21.989 --> 01:15:24.992
Let it flow through
your fingers.

01:15:26.727 --> 01:15:31.065
Let my voice be your guide.

01:15:40.374 --> 01:15:42.743
<i>Why isn't anybody
calling somebody?</i>

01:15:42.777 --> 01:15:44.278
<i>Call somebody!</i>

01:15:44.311 --> 01:15:46.047
<i>Mia! Mia!</i>

01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:50.584
<i>Relinquish control...</i>

01:15:52.019 --> 01:15:54.622
<i>and sink to the bottom.</i>

01:16:32.927 --> 01:16:35.096
I...

01:16:35.129 --> 01:16:36.797
I'm home.

01:16:53.948 --> 01:16:55.282
Dad?

01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:58.152
Dad.

01:16:58.185 --> 01:16:59.820
Dad, I'm back.

01:17:01.822 --> 01:17:03.357
I'm back, Dad.

01:17:04.425 --> 01:17:05.993
Dad?

01:17:08.262 --> 01:17:10.931
Oh, Dad. I'm back.

01:17:12.133 --> 01:17:14.635
- My girl.
- I'm home, Dad.

01:17:15.903 --> 01:17:17.037
My girl.

01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:22.843
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:17:24.145 --> 01:17:25.846
I'm sorry.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.715
I shouldn't have left you.

01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:31.719
I promise I won't
leave you again.

01:17:31.752 --> 01:17:34.021
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:17:34.054 --> 01:17:35.789
You left me to die.

01:17:35.823 --> 01:17:37.858
No.

01:17:37.892 --> 01:17:39.793
No, I'm...

01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:41.695
Dad?

01:17:41.729 --> 01:17:42.997
Oh, Dad.

01:17:44.798 --> 01:17:46.934
Dad.

01:17:46.967 --> 01:17:48.335
Dad?

01:19:09.984 --> 01:19:12.419
Mia? Mia?

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:19.093
Mia? Mia?

01:19:24.031 --> 01:19:25.799
Mia? Mia?

01:19:27.134 --> 01:19:29.236
I fell... I fell asleep.

01:19:31.005 --> 01:19:32.906
I just fell asleep.

01:19:34.609 --> 01:19:36.076
Mia?

01:20:19.219 --> 01:20:21.088
Chelsey never left?

01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:25.025
She was right.

01:20:29.196 --> 01:20:31.065
Henry?

01:20:31.098 --> 01:20:32.433
Henry?

01:20:34.569 --> 01:20:36.036
Henry?

01:20:37.404 --> 01:20:38.906
Henry?

01:20:53.954 --> 01:20:55.155
Henry?

01:20:59.026 --> 01:21:00.227
Henry?

01:21:01.362 --> 01:21:02.630
Henry?

01:21:09.937 --> 01:21:11.138
Chelsey.

01:21:15.309 --> 01:21:17.645
Chelsey, it's Henry.
Can you hear me?

01:21:20.147 --> 01:21:22.316
I'm going to pull this out,
okay?

01:22:13.635 --> 01:22:15.002
Professor!

01:22:31.519 --> 01:22:33.120
Professor?

01:22:34.288 --> 01:22:35.590
Professor?

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:38.626
Professor.

01:22:43.163 --> 01:22:46.333
Eternal night, eternal life,
Henry.

01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:51.773
It was you.

01:23:09.056 --> 01:23:10.290
What are you?

01:23:10.324 --> 01:23:12.627
I'm eternal, Henry.

01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:17.331
Would you like this back?

01:23:26.608 --> 01:23:30.778
I must fill this house
for all eternity.

01:23:30.812 --> 01:23:32.379
Sir...

01:23:32.412 --> 01:23:34.649
I can give you the freedom
that you need.

01:23:36.283 --> 01:23:39.453
But you have a choice
to stay here with me.

01:23:40.722 --> 01:23:42.256
With who?

01:23:45.259 --> 01:23:47.695
The Mad Hatter, of course.

01:24:41.549 --> 01:24:43.116
Henry?

01:24:45.252 --> 01:24:46.721
Henry?

01:24:57.665 --> 01:24:59.834
Mia? Mia.

01:24:59.867 --> 01:25:03.538
I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:25:03.571 --> 01:25:05.573
I missed you so much.

01:25:05.607 --> 01:25:07.875
I love you. I'm so sorry.

01:25:09.209 --> 01:25:10.511
I'm so sorry.

01:25:12.245 --> 01:25:15.148
I love you so much
and I'm sorry.

01:25:18.318 --> 01:25:19.821
I'm so sorry.

01:25:23.758 --> 01:25:25.292
I'm so sorry.

01:26:10.337 --> 01:26:13.741
<i>Eternal night. Eternal life.</i>

01:26:13.775 --> 01:26:15.777
<i>Praise be.</i>

01:26:15.810 --> 01:26:18.579
<i>Eternal night. Eternal life.</i>

01:26:18.613 --> 01:26:19.914
<i>Praise be.</i>

01:26:37.732 --> 01:26:39.767
<i>But then something happened.</i>

01:26:39.801 --> 01:26:43.470
<i>He lost his hatter business
and, some even say, his mind.</i>

01:26:43.503 --> 01:26:46.541
Now why am I,
a psychology professor,

01:26:46.574 --> 01:26:48.609
interested in Mr. Williams?
