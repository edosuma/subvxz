WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:08.793
The seven Dragon Balls,

00:09.009 --> 00:13.548
when gathered together, will grant any wish.

00:13.764 --> 00:18.554
The Saiyan who was raised on Earth, Son Goku,

00:18.769 --> 00:22.136
has thwarted the ambitions of
one powerful foe after another

00:22.356 --> 00:26.565
as they tried to get their
hands on the Dragon Balls.

00:26.777 --> 00:32.692
And, in the thick of battle
with the space emperor Freeza...

00:32.908 --> 00:36.275
How dare you... How dare you...?!

00:40.874 --> 00:45.834
...he was roused to become
a legendary Super Saiyan.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.455
You monkey!!

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:58.559 --> 01:01.767
You deserve to be killed!

01:02.771 --> 01:06.889
You dumbass!!

01:10.988 --> 01:14.697
After an intense battle,
he defeated Freeza at last,

01:14.908 --> 01:17.615
and preserved the peace.

01:18.787 --> 01:23.451
Several years later, a new crisis
closed in on the Earth.

01:31.884 --> 01:36.719
It was the threat of the Artificial Humans.

01:36.930 --> 01:41.515
At length, a fight against
the mightiest Artificial Human,

01:53.405 --> 01:55.521
Ka... me...

01:55.741 --> 01:58.733
...ha... me...

02:01.997 --> 02:03.328
Oh, crap!

02:03.540 --> 02:05.997
...Ha!!

02:08.294 --> 02:12.755
Goku put up a fierce fight against Cell...

02:12.966 --> 02:15.673
You're up next, Gohan!

02:19.181 --> 02:21.046
Focusing on the future,

02:21.266 --> 02:26.056
he entrusted the battle to his son, Son Gohan.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.763
However, Gohan was faced
with an uphill battle.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.893
Come on, come on, come on, come on! Well?!

02:34.112 --> 02:36.945
If you're going to get mad,
then really blow your top!

02:49.044 --> 02:50.784
Son Gohan...

02:51.004 --> 02:54.997
It is no sin to fight for what is right.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.960
There are some people
that words will not reach.

02:59.179 --> 03:03.047
Give your inner self over freely to your anger.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.724
There's no reason to hold it in.

03:09.648 --> 03:13.266
Nobody asked you, you factory reject.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.629
At the destruction of the
Artificial Human No. 17,

03:35.841 --> 03:40.255
who had reached out to him,
Gohan's anger erupted.

03:40.470 --> 03:45.305
His hidden power unleashed,
he overwhelmed Cell.

03:45.517 --> 03:49.760
Cell planned to blow himself up,
along with the whole Earth,

03:49.980 --> 03:54.940
but Goku prevented it,
in exchange for his own life.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.359
Goodbye, Gohan.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.024
Father!

04:03.243 --> 04:05.950
Goku!!

04:06.163 --> 04:09.326
Y-You idiot! Don't bring that guy here!

04:09.541 --> 04:12.874
Sorry, Kaio-sama! This was the only place!

04:13.086 --> 04:20.173
Damn it!!

04:29.436 --> 04:31.051
W-What?!

04:35.192 --> 04:36.648
Ka...

04:36.860 --> 04:38.942
......me

04:39.154 --> 04:41.611
...ha...

04:41.823 --> 04:45.031
......me

04:50.040 --> 05:01.463
...Ha!!

05:11.186 --> 05:14.553
Gohan, carrying out Goku's final wish,

05:14.773 --> 05:17.230
wrung out the last of his strength

05:17.442 --> 05:21.026
and wiped out the resurrected Cell.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.947
With that, the threat of the
Artificial Humans was removed,

05:25.158 --> 05:29.868
and peace returned to Earth. And now...

05:30.080 --> 05:31.320
Father”.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.124
...Gohan's new life begins.

07:03.090 --> 07:08.050
"Seven Years Later! Starting Today,
Gohan is a High School Student."

07:12.140 --> 07:16.224
Seven years have passed
since the fight with Cell.

07:16.436 --> 07:20.020
Thanks to Son Goku and son's exploits,

07:20.232 --> 07:23.599
the Earth has been saved
from Cell's fiendish grasp,

07:23.819 --> 07:27.403
and its people were able to return
to a life of peace once again.

07:27.614 --> 07:31.527
However, when people become
so accustomed to such peace,

07:31.743 --> 07:34.735
the number of fools soon begins to increase.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.288
That is just how mankind is.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.209
Come on, come on!
Hurry up and make with the money!

07:50.428 --> 07:51.417
You wanna get killed?!

07:51.638 --> 07:53.720
Hurry and fill it up!

07:53.932 --> 07:56.093
Hey, this looks like all of it.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.924
All right, let's scram!

07:58.145 --> 08:01.888
Once we use up the money we got,
we'll be back again!

08:13.076 --> 08:17.194
Son Gohan had turned 16.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.577
He had been studying at home on his own,

08:20.792 --> 08:23.534
as well as via correspondence
courses up until now,

08:23.753 --> 08:27.337
but his mother, Chichi,
was concerned that it was not enough,

08:27.549 --> 08:29.790
and so starting today,

08:30.010 --> 08:34.094
he will begin attending a
high school in Satan City.

08:35.807 --> 08:40.176
Hmm? I'm at the edge of town.
I think it's time for me to land.

08:41.563 --> 08:45.272
Bye-bye, Kinto Un! I'll see you
again for the ride home!

08:54.910 --> 08:58.494
Father, Mister Satan is believed to be the hero

08:58.705 --> 09:01.913
who saved the Earth from Cell.

09:02.125 --> 09:09.873
So much so that his town of residence
was renamed "Satan City."

09:11.468 --> 09:12.628
Uh-oh...

09:12.844 --> 09:15.586
Maybe I took it too slow getting here.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.643
All right!

09:37.869 --> 09:42.909
Not again. There's just no helping this town.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.491
I'll have to transform again,
so no one knows who I really am.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.878
Come on, come on! Come get some!

09:59.641 --> 10:02.132
W-Who do you think you are?!

10:22.914 --> 10:24.199
|-|t's a monster!

10:24.416 --> 10:26.281
G-Get out of here!

10:40.432 --> 10:42.673
A-Amazing!

10:42.892 --> 10:44.678
H-Huh?

10:45.687 --> 10:47.928
W-What happened?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.643
Say...

10:54.863 --> 10:58.071
Who did this? It couldn't be the police, right?

10:58.283 --> 11:01.400
S-Search me, I didn't see.

11:01.619 --> 11:06.739
Aw, and I flew all the way here, too.
Who in the world could it be?

11:06.958 --> 11:12.578
Ah, Videl-sama, I saw it all.
It was that Golden Warrior.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.630
The Golden Warrior? Again?

11:15.842 --> 11:18.834
H-He was incredibly fast and strong!

11:19.054 --> 11:23.138
He even flipped the fleeing
criminals' car from a distance,

11:23.350 --> 11:25.557
using some kind of Kiai shout, or something.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.260
Oh, yeah, and he was probably a student

11:28.480 --> 11:30.311
at Orange Star High School, like you.

11:30.523 --> 11:34.186
--Huh?
--He was wearing the same school badge.

11:34.402 --> 11:38.145
A-A student at our high school...?

11:39.657 --> 11:44.902
Is there anyone like that there?
Someone who has golden hair?

11:57.258 --> 12:01.126
Say, Shapner, you're not
the Golden Warrior, are you?

12:01.346 --> 12:03.086
Unfortunately, no.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.423
l was in early morning training, for my club.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.100
I don't have time to be
involved in that nonsense.

12:09.312 --> 12:13.521
Hey, Videl, do you think he's
even stronger than your papa?

12:13.733 --> 12:14.518
Don't be ridiculous.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.272
Videl's papa is Mister Satan,
the man who saved the Earth!

12:18.488 --> 12:21.525
Like there's anyone in the world
stronger than him!

12:26.704 --> 12:28.035
Good morning, everyone.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.739
Allow me to introduce a new student

12:30.959 --> 12:33.996
who is being admitted into your class today.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.748
Come on in.

12:37.674 --> 12:42.464
H-Hello. l'm Son. Son Gohan.
P-Pleasure to meet you.

12:42.679 --> 12:46.171
Oh, he's pretty cute, isn't he? Just my type.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.677
"Gohan," he says. What a weird name.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.521
Seems like I've seen him somewhere before...

12:55.608 --> 12:59.066
Looks like a mild-mannered
little bookworm, that's for sure.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.361
Son-kun is an honor student

13:01.573 --> 13:06.567
who got perfect scores on his admissions exam
in everything--math, chemistry, physics,

13:06.786 --> 13:08.993
history, language, and foreign languages.

13:10.039 --> 13:14.408
Quiet down! I hope you all get
a little motivation from him.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.460
Son-kun, sit in any open seat you like.

13:17.672 --> 13:18.957
Ah, right.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.039
L-Let's see...

13:21.259 --> 13:22.465
Over here!

13:22.677 --> 13:23.587
Here, here!

13:23.803 --> 13:25.794
O-Oh, thanks.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.783
H-Hi there.

13:52.999 --> 13:57.368
I'm Eraza. Nice to meet you.
And while I'm at it, this is Videl.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.878
Gohan-kun, you'll be surprised to hear this--

14:01.090 --> 14:05.299
Videl's papa is, get this, the Mister Satan!

14:05.512 --> 14:08.549
Eh? M-Mister Satan?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.255
You see? You're surprised.

14:10.475 --> 14:14.468
Th-Then, you're Mister Satan's daughter?

14:14.687 --> 14:17.019
That's right. You should be grateful.

14:17.232 --> 14:21.316
After all, it's thanks to her papa
that we're all alive right now.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.314
That's it! You're...

14:23.530 --> 14:25.145
You're the boy who was there this morning

14:25.365 --> 14:26.821
where they arrested those bank robbers, right?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.239
Y-Yes.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.193
Oh, where they say the
Golden Warrior showed up?

14:31.412 --> 14:35.246
Huh? Golden Warrior? Who's that?

14:35.458 --> 14:38.325
You just got here, so you wouldn't know, huh?

14:38.545 --> 14:39.660
He's a fighter for justice

14:39.879 --> 14:42.370
who has shown up three times
over the last ten days or so.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.377
He's a man who's famous around town
for being incredibly strong

14:45.593 --> 14:48.585
and for having golden hair that stands on end.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.545
Th-They're talking about me!

14:50.765 --> 14:54.849
Twice when I came here to register
for school, and this morning!

14:55.061 --> 14:57.803
Stare...

15:02.860 --> 15:03.690
Listen...

15:03.903 --> 15:05.768
When I talked to one of the witnesses there,

15:05.989 --> 15:07.274
he said that the Golden Warrior

15:07.490 --> 15:09.276
was wearing a badge from this school,

15:09.492 --> 15:14.987
a whitish shirt with a black vest,
and brown slacks.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.953
It may be a coincidence,
but you're a dead ringer, huh?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.544
--Huh?
--Oh, you're right!

15:20.753 --> 15:22.789
N-No, l was just...

15:23.798 --> 15:25.754
Look who you're talking about.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.674
Do you really think he's built like a warrior?

15:28.886 --> 15:30.171
It's always been a rule of thumb

15:30.388 --> 15:33.801
that anyone good at studying is utterly
hopeless when it comes to athletics.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.803
For another thing, he's not blond.

15:36.019 --> 15:40.262
Yeah, he's right. You do seem
pretty weak, sorry to say.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.062
Y-Yeah, you're right.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.480
Well, of course, I don't think it's him,

15:46.696 --> 15:49.438
but on the old videos of Papa fighting Cell,

15:49.657 --> 15:53.491
there was an odd bunch whose hair
changed to blond, huh?

15:53.703 --> 15:56.069
Papa said it was just a silly trick, though.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.156
Um, Gohan-kun, was it?
Do you commute here from home?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.240
Or do you have an apartment in town instead?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.622
Oh, I come here from my home.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.374
Ah, where is your house?

16:05.590 --> 16:09.458
Um, it's in Section 439 East. A small village.

16:09.677 --> 16:13.670
Eh?! Section 439 East? You're kidding, right?

16:13.890 --> 16:15.846
That's a thousand kilometers
from here, you know!

16:16.059 --> 16:17.640
Be quiet!

16:19.687 --> 16:21.552
Just how do you get here?

16:21.773 --> 16:24.355
Even a jet flyer would take
five hours at that distance!

16:24.567 --> 16:29.357
Well, uh, it does take a lot of time,
you see. It's a real pain.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.114
A-Aw, rats...

16:35.620 --> 16:36.985
For today's gym period,

16:37.205 --> 16:40.572
we'll pick up where we left off
last time with a baseball game.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.374
Hey, you know what baseball is?

16:43.586 --> 16:46.419
Yes. I've never played it,
but I know the rules, at least.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.373
You've never played it?

16:49.592 --> 16:53.505
That's a hoot. I'll bet all
you've ever done is study.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.178
Videl, you can have him on your team.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.255
I don't want him.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.761
Why not? He's a real egghead,
so you never know,

16:59.977 --> 17:03.469
he might just come up
with some good strategies.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.646
Yeah, you're right. Okay.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.942
You take right field.
You know where right field is?

17:10.154 --> 17:11.484
Yes, to the right side, isn't it?

17:11.698 --> 17:16.192
The right side? Well, you're not wrong...

17:23.584 --> 17:25.665
l have to take things appropriately easy here.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.492
Both Mother and Bulma-san said

17:27.714 --> 17:28.954
that if people find out who I really am,

17:29.173 --> 17:32.165
it will become a huge deal,
and things will go sour.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.922
Being out in the world sure is hard.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.675
Let 'em have it, Shapner!

17:37.890 --> 17:40.006
You won't hit this one, Shapner!

17:45.523 --> 17:46.353
Damn!

17:46.566 --> 17:48.522
He did it! That's a home run!

17:54.031 --> 17:55.737
The runner on third is off the base.

17:55.950 --> 17:59.943
If I remember correctly, if I throw it
to third in this situation, she'll be out.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.700
All right, gently, gently...

18:02.915 --> 18:04.416
This should be about right...

18:10.089 --> 18:11.590
Are you all right?!

18:14.051 --> 18:15.552
You're out.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.925
I did it! Three outs, change sides!

18:23.603 --> 18:26.970
This is bad. Even at that,
I might have overdone things.

18:27.190 --> 18:32.059
Th-That was amazing. l-l'll bet you
must have jumped eight meters.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.940
Oh, no, it was just a fluke, just a fluke.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.862
Oh, just a fluke, huh?

18:37.074 --> 18:39.861
S-Still, is that something you can call a fluke?

18:40.077 --> 18:41.988
Okay, who's the next batter?

18:42.205 --> 18:45.117
We're starting from number 8, right?
|-|sn't that you?

18:45.333 --> 18:46.743
Oh, right! Right! Right! Right!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.335
Sorry!

18:48.544 --> 18:51.251
H-How is his batting?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.295
L-Let's have a look.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.968
You bat left, do you?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.169
Huh? Is that okay?

19:00.389 --> 19:02.300
Oh, no, it's fine,

19:02.517 --> 19:04.132
but your grip is backward.

19:04.352 --> 19:08.061
--Backward how?
--Never mind, just bat however you like.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.514
--Okay.
--You've got some nerve,
stealing my home run earlier.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.350
Hmph, maybe I should intimidate you a little.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.562
This is bad. If I draw any more
attention to myself, it'll be bad.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.272
I won't hit it.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.735
Here goes! If you don't
dodge this one, you're dead!

19:27.208 --> 19:28.698
Oh, no!

19:30.920 --> 19:34.754
Y-You idiot! W-Why didn't
you get out of the way?!

19:41.055 --> 19:44.218
Um, this is what's known
as a "dead ball," right?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.389
Mm-hmm...

19:46.602 --> 19:49.059
Lucky me, lucky me! I didn't have
to hit it, and still got on base!

19:49.272 --> 19:50.978
I didn't draw attention,
I didn't draw attention!

19:51.190 --> 19:54.603
W-What is his story...?

19:57.071 --> 19:58.572
Something's fishy here.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.785
Hey, what club have you settled on?

20:05.997 --> 20:08.238
Uh, I haven't settled on one yet.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.413
In that case, come join the boxing club.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.618
You're tougher than I thought,
and you'd probably be pretty decent.

20:13.838 --> 20:17.626
Um, I'm not planning to
join any clubs. You see...

20:17.842 --> 20:21.676
Right, right, Gohan-kun's house
is incredibly far away.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.174
He doesn't have any time for club activities.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.596
Th-That's right.

20:25.808 --> 20:29.847
Hey, let's head home together.
Give me a lift to my place?

20:30.062 --> 20:34.647
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. My car is a one-seater.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.225
Then move here, to Satan City.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.686
No, uh... I mean...

20:43.242 --> 20:46.200
Something's fishy, all right.
If his house is so far away,

20:46.412 --> 20:49.745
why isn't he taking a car or a jet flyer?

21:00.843 --> 21:02.344
Huh?

21:13.189 --> 21:15.430
The city sure is exhausting.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.733
And I have to say, as for the "Golden Warrior,"

21:18.945 --> 21:22.062
I'm going to need a better set-up,
so people don't know it's me.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.523
I think I'll talk to Bulma-san about that.

21:25.743 --> 21:29.076
The first day of high school
has come to an end.

21:29.288 --> 21:35.284
Gohan thought that it was the most
exhausting day of his whole life.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.480
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:43.696 --> 22:47.530
Gohan, that's sure a funny outfit
you've got on. What's going on?

22:47.742 --> 22:51.576
Aw, gee whiz, Father,
this looks cool, doesn't it?

22:51.787 --> 22:55.154
Look, I even thought up the perfect pose!

22:55.374 --> 22:56.989
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:57.209 --> 22:59.951
"A New Hero, the Great Saiyaman, is Born!"

23:00.171 --> 23:03.880
"The champion of justice,
who will not tolerate evil, has arrived!"

23:04.091 --> 23:05.672
Nailed it!

23:06.305 --> 23:12.366
