No need, 'cause we can find it for you.

07:50.308 --> 07:52.541
I got a guy who can find anything.

07:52.577 --> 07:53.676
You got... you got a couple seconds?

07:53.711 --> 07:55.111
- You got a guy?
- I got a guy.

07:55.146 --> 07:56.779
- I love that.
- [laughing]

07:56.814 --> 07:58.714
Am I in New Jersey? Of course I am.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.216
You got a guy.

08:00.251 --> 08:02.952
We don't want to
have any Stash customers

08:02.987 --> 08:04.286
leave disappointed,

08:04.322 --> 08:06.355
let alone a Ralph Macchio, right?

08:06.391 --> 08:08.424
Yeah, let alone one that could crane
kick your ass.

08:08.459 --> 08:10.526
[all laughing]

08:10.561 --> 08:13.195
But I figured if this
"Karate Kid" play set

08:13.231 --> 08:14.530
is anywhere in New Jersey,

08:14.565 --> 08:16.365
there's only one guy that I should call

08:16.401 --> 08:17.566
to find the piece for me.

08:17.602 --> 08:19.268
Ah, the Mr. Miyagi... [laughter]

08:19.303 --> 08:21.103
Of the collectible world, if you will.

08:21.139 --> 08:22.371
Ah, Rob Bruce.

08:22.407 --> 08:25.741
[all laughing]

08:25.777 --> 08:29.211
It's the "Karate
Kid" Competition Center.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.614
Yeah. It's for Ralph Macchio.
[snickers]

08:31.649 --> 08:33.448
Listen, listen, they had
a couple different ones,

08:33.484 --> 08:34.884
but it's gotta be the
Competition Center one.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.652
- With the referee.
- With the referee.

08:36.688 --> 08:38.220
It's gotta have... if it
doesn't have the referee-

08:38.256 --> 08:39.587
- Did you hear that? Yes.
- I got the other ones.

08:39.624 --> 08:41.090
- I know it's
- I know it's his voice.

08:41.125 --> 08:42.725
I know.
[laughs]

08:42.760 --> 08:43.958
All right, yes. All right.

08:43.995 --> 08:45.394
Do you have an hour to spare?

08:45.430 --> 08:47.930
You know, look around,
you know? You got an hour?

08:47.965 --> 08:49.632
Hang out with you guys for an hour?

08:49.667 --> 08:51.267
- Yeah, if you want.
- All right, I'll hang out

08:51.302 --> 08:53.102
with you guys for an hour.
You... if you deliver the toy.

08:53.137 --> 08:54.737
All right, he's already on it.
He already hung up on me.

08:54.772 --> 08:56.105
- All right, great. Great.
- He's already out

08:56.140 --> 08:57.473
- lookin' for it.
- Oh, man. I got... I got...

08:57.508 --> 08:58.774
I got three witnesses.

08:58.810 --> 09:00.843
And this is awesome,
to have a Jersey guy

09:00.878 --> 09:02.812
at the Stash lookin' to buy this.

09:02.847 --> 09:04.013
It's funny, you know, you think I'm

09:04.048 --> 09:05.414
everybody thinks I'm from Jersey.

09:05.450 --> 09:06.515
I don't mean to burst your bubble,

09:06.551 --> 09:08.284
but I'm from, uh,

09:08.319 --> 09:09.952
the other side of Manhattan, Long Island.

09:09.987 --> 09:11.353
- Aww.
- See, what happens is,

09:11.389 --> 09:13.756
people blur the Daniel LaRusso character.

09:13.791 --> 09:15.191
They blur-he's from Jersey.

09:15.226 --> 09:16.625
Everybody thinks I'm from Newark.

09:16.661 --> 09:17.827
And I drive a green station wagon.

09:17.862 --> 09:18.828
[laughter] Or my mother drives

09:18.863 --> 09:20.663
a green station wagon.

09:20.698 --> 09:22.498
So you know, they'll yell
out "LaRusso," and I'm like,

09:22.533 --> 09:25.534
"Eh, not really, not really. Not really. "

09:25.570 --> 09:27.770
So you don't have any
martial arts moves or anything?

09:27.805 --> 09:29.138
Oh, man, I'll slip a disk.

09:29.173 --> 09:30.606
That was a-those are long gone.
[laughter]

09:30.641 --> 09:32.274
Or let's put it this way, when they-

09:32.310 --> 09:33.542
when they stopped payin'
me, I stopped kickin'.

09:33.578 --> 09:34.944
I don't know. Do you know anything

09:34.979 --> 09:36.345
- about martial arts?
- I know nothing.

09:36.380 --> 09:37.613
- You know, I grew up in Asian.
- Right. Bingo.

09:37.648 --> 09:39.148
So we... we speak the same language...

09:39.183 --> 09:40.683
- Oh, absolutely.
- When they come up to you.

09:40.718 --> 09:42.184
Like, "Show me whatever. " "I don't know. "

09:42.220 --> 09:43.819
You pretended you knew karate, right?

09:43.855 --> 09:44.987
- You said when you were little?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:45.022 --> 09:46.355
Well, you could always do that.

09:46.390 --> 09:48.157
You always have that. You just take...

09:48.192 --> 09:49.492
- if you just learn a good stance.
- Oh, yeah, I... I fake the...

09:49.527 --> 09:50.793
Come on. Let's see your stance.

09:50.828 --> 09:51.894
Oh, I would copy one from the movie,

09:51.929 --> 09:52.895
- like, you know, like...
- Yeah.

09:52.930 --> 09:54.163
[laughter]

09:54.198 --> 09:55.698
- He looks like...
- Constipated.

09:55.733 --> 09:57.299
- Constipated.
- I wouldn't constipate it.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.801
And he's got the kung
fu grip goin' on there.

09:58.836 --> 09:59.836
- Right, exactly.
- It's, like, weird.

09:59.871 --> 10:02.238
Honestly, one of the
hundred greatest moments

10:02.274 --> 10:05.208
in cinematic history is Daniel LaRusso

10:05.243 --> 10:07.910
crane-kickin' Johnny out in the ring.

10:07.946 --> 10:10.580
It is a moment captured so well.

10:10.615 --> 10:12.749
The exuberance, the joy,

10:12.784 --> 10:14.150
of all involved.

10:14.185 --> 10:15.752
The moment he jumps into this-

10:15.787 --> 10:17.353
No mercy!

10:17.389 --> 10:18.921
Raise your fists, Johnny!

10:18.957 --> 10:20.690
Finish him!

10:20.725 --> 10:22.158
I get, like, chills.

10:22.193 --> 10:23.660
I get almost glassy thinkin' about it.

10:23.695 --> 10:25.094
When he jumps into
this, and everyone's just

10:25.130 --> 10:26.529
lookin' at him, we all know.

10:26.564 --> 10:27.697
We're like, "He's gonna kick him

10:27.732 --> 10:29.232
in the [bleep] face!"

10:29.267 --> 10:30.767
[crowd cheering]

10:30.802 --> 10:34.203
[all laughing]

10:34.239 --> 10:35.905
If you want to preach
like Captain Planet...

10:35.940 --> 10:37.874
- [giggles]
- You gotta walk the walk.

10:37.909 --> 10:39.442
- Uh, Ralph, he's here.
- Hey, Walt.

10:39.477 --> 10:40.510
- He said he had a guy.
- Yeah?

10:40.545 --> 10:41.511
He's got a guy.

10:41.546 --> 10:42.578
And here's the item.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.237
I've always wanted to know,
in that scene in "Karate Kid"

10:46.272 --> 10:47.238
where you caught the flies...

10:47.273 --> 10:48.906
You ever catch one?

10:48.941 --> 10:51.509
Not yet.

10:51.544 --> 10:53.077
How was it done?

10:53.112 --> 10:54.578
That's a good question, 'cause that

10:54.614 --> 10:57.014
that was-you know, it
was before CGI, right?

10:57.050 --> 10:59.083
So they must've set that scene up

10:59.118 --> 11:02.453
six or seven times, and
we tried it different ways.

11:02.488 --> 11:04.188
We put one where we put it in there,

11:04.223 --> 11:06.057
and I had to react, like, backwards.

11:06.092 --> 11:08.426
Like, we started with the fly in there,

11:08.461 --> 11:10.594
and then I'd have to watch it go away.

11:10.630 --> 11:12.063
And when they played it
back, it was just, like,

11:12.098 --> 11:13.264
the worst backward acting...

11:13.299 --> 11:14.765
[laughter] You could ever imagine.

11:14.801 --> 11:16.634
And so the still photographer on the set

11:16.669 --> 11:18.736
had the ability to catch
a fly with his hand,

11:18.771 --> 11:20.137
and they would take monofilament-

11:20.173 --> 11:22.039
like, thin, thin fishing line-

11:22.075 --> 11:24.708
and he would actually
lasso these live flies,

11:24.744 --> 11:26.043
and I would try to grab

11:26.079 --> 11:28.546
this monofilament string and slide down.

11:28.581 --> 11:30.381
I decapitated at least three of 'em.

11:30.416 --> 11:31.649
[all laughing]

11:31.684 --> 11:33.217
As time went by,

11:33.252 --> 11:36.387
the weight of the string
was slowing down this fly.

11:36.422 --> 11:37.955
- By the end, he was just
- [laughter]

11:37.990 --> 11:40.758
Wings out, just like, "Find the next fly. "

11:40.793 --> 11:42.726
In one shot, I catch it, and the-

11:42.762 --> 11:44.562
the fly's at the end-

11:44.597 --> 11:47.231
Hey, hey! Hey, Mr. Miyagi, look.

11:47.266 --> 11:48.466
Hmm.

11:48.501 --> 11:49.633
So that's-that's that story.

11:49.669 --> 11:52.002
So there's a little exclusive,

11:52.038 --> 11:53.370
fly-catching exclusive.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.194
- All right, have a great day.
- Thanks a lot.

12:05.229 --> 12:06.929
Thanks. [register drawer closes]

12:06.964 --> 12:08.363
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

12:08.399 --> 12:09.998
Good. What can we do for you today?

12:10.034 --> 12:12.668
Do you guys by any chance
have Captain Planet comics?

12:12.703 --> 12:14.036
Captain-wow.

12:14.071 --> 12:15.504
I haven't heard that in a long time.

12:15.539 --> 12:17.473
- We may have some Captain
Planet in the basement.

12:17.508 --> 12:19.174
You want to go check it out?
- Yeah, I'll go-I'll go check.

12:19.210 --> 12:20.142
Thanks.

12:27.017 --> 12:28.851
- Big Captain Planet fan?
- Yes.

12:28.886 --> 12:30.152
I grew up with that show,

12:30.187 --> 12:32.054
and I currently work at a library,

12:32.089 --> 12:33.455
and I thought it would be a good idea

12:33.491 --> 12:34.890
if I could donate comics

12:34.925 --> 12:36.391
and educate the kids that come in

12:36.427 --> 12:38.127
about saving the planet.

12:38.162 --> 12:41.663
That's right, Captain
Planet was an-an eco-superhero.

12:41.699 --> 12:44.032
- Oh, we had some.
- Found some down there.

12:44.068 --> 12:46.034
- Oh, this is perfect.
- Ooh, a number 1 too.

12:46.070 --> 12:47.236
- Yeah.
- Wow.

12:47.271 --> 12:48.737
He's a man from the '90s, right?

12:48.773 --> 12:50.305
It looks like he's got hockey hair.

12:50.341 --> 12:51.306
[laughter]

12:51.342 --> 12:52.574
But what I want to ask you,

12:52.610 --> 12:53.976
as someone who's a big fan,

12:54.011 --> 12:55.577
do you utilize the lessons you learn

12:55.613 --> 12:57.179
from watching "Captain Planet" today?

12:57.214 --> 12:58.881
Do-do you do things differently?

12:58.916 --> 13:00.482
Oh, yes. That's a very big thing for me.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.317
How's your carbon
footprint? You got a Prius?

13:02.353 --> 13:03.752
[laughing] No.

13:03.788 --> 13:05.087
- He's got a Prius.
- He has a Prius,

13:05.122 --> 13:07.356
- and he hates the environment.
- Yeah.

13:07.391 --> 13:09.858
Man, you want to preach
like Captain Planet,

13:09.894 --> 13:11.827
you gotta walk the walk.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.195
Hold on. You got that Prius

13:13.230 --> 13:15.164
to save money on gas.

13:15.199 --> 13:16.999
You didn't get it 'cause you
cared about the environment.

13:17.034 --> 13:18.734
All-all those Coke cans you drink?

13:18.769 --> 13:20.235
Don't I see you just
chucking 'em in the garbage?

13:20.271 --> 13:21.270
- Yeah.
- I don't see you recycling.

13:21.305 --> 13:22.704
Who cares about bauxite?

13:22.740 --> 13:25.240
[all laughing]

13:25.276 --> 13:27.176
Nowaday, it's trendy,
but I remember a man

13:27.211 --> 13:28.744
who was conscious of our planet's needs

13:28.779 --> 13:30.345
when it wasn't trendy.

13:30.381 --> 13:32.514
Are you talking about
Captain Planet or someone else?

13:32.550 --> 13:34.216
Talkin' about Bryan Johnson.

13:34.251 --> 13:35.617
- Oh.
- The original tree hugger.

13:35.653 --> 13:37.119
That's right.

13:37.154 --> 13:40.689
In our group, you were
the most eco-conscious.

13:40.724 --> 13:43.625
He would shame me for throwing cans out

13:43.661 --> 13:45.427
in-in my garbage, right,

13:45.462 --> 13:46.595
in front of my wife.

13:46.630 --> 13:48.230
[all laughing]

13:48.265 --> 13:49.631
Yeah, I was very into it.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.100
Like, adopting acres of rainforest.

13:52.136 --> 13:53.402
- [laughing]
- Like, helping out elephants...

13:53.437 --> 13:55.737
oh, that's a riot, right?

13:55.773 --> 13:57.239
Wait, at one time you had a soul?

13:57.274 --> 13:58.540
[laughter] This was-

13:58.576 --> 14:00.075
You were big into saving things.

14:00.110 --> 14:01.476
Until you gave up, and
then, like, "I don't care.

14:01.512 --> 14:03.145
- Let 'em all go. "
- Yeah.

14:03.180 --> 14:05.113
That's why we need
Captain Planet back, right?

14:05.149 --> 14:06.615
[all laughing]

14:06.650 --> 14:07.983
You said that you're a librarian?

14:08.018 --> 14:09.084
- Yes.
- Could you think

14:09.119 --> 14:10.419
you could give him some pointers?

14:10.454 --> 14:13.055
'Cause he's got a devil of a time

14:13.090 --> 14:14.990
trying to restock and reorder the books.

14:15.025 --> 14:17.092
What's your advice for
improving on his stupidity,

14:17.127 --> 14:19.461
is what he's asking.
It's not stupidity.

14:19.496 --> 14:21.630
Our-our system's even more ancient

14:21.665 --> 14:23.165
than the-the card catalog.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.400
[all laughing]

14:25.436 --> 14:27.769
All right, so let's see
what, uh, issues we got here.

14:27.805 --> 14:29.404
We got number 1.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.341
First appearance in comic
book form of Captain Planet.

14:32.376 --> 14:36.578
Number 2, he's fighting a pollution dragon.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.513
- Number 3.
- Getting chased down

14:38.549 --> 14:40.015
by what appear to be rabid animals.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.350
No, no, no, no, no.

14:41.385 --> 14:43.819
That's her team, leading the charge.

14:43.854 --> 14:46.455
Here's one-now, I mean,
savin' the dolphins, man.

14:46.490 --> 14:48.924
- Number 9.
- Ooh.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.692
Poor Captain Planet
looks like he just had to

14:50.728 --> 14:52.628
fly out of a cesspool.

14:52.663 --> 14:54.096
And number 11.

14:54.131 --> 14:56.331
Probably the best cover of the lot.

14:56.367 --> 14:58.200
All the rings comin' together

14:58.235 --> 14:59.968
to form Captain Planet.

15:00.004 --> 15:01.436
We're missin' a couple, but it's a-

15:01.472 --> 15:02.437
it's a nice little run.

15:02.473 --> 15:03.639
Definitely.

15:03.674 --> 15:05.007
What are you looking for for these?

15:05.042 --> 15:06.308
Uh.

15:06.343 --> 15:07.976
They must command a high price,

15:08.012 --> 15:09.778
being down in the basement, I'm sure.

15:09.813 --> 15:12.180
We realize, you know, I
mean, not a lot of people

15:12.216 --> 15:13.882
comin' in for Captain Planet.

15:13.918 --> 15:15.717
For the whole lot, $10.

15:15.753 --> 15:17.352
- $10, really?
- Yeah.

15:17.388 --> 15:19.821
All right, sounds
like a good deal to me.

15:19.857 --> 15:21.056
- All right.
- Sold.

15:21.091 --> 15:22.891
[giggles]
- Oh, nice.

15:22.927 --> 15:24.126
I'm sure kids at the library

15:24.161 --> 15:27.062
are gonna be very happy to read those.

15:27.097 --> 15:29.464
Power is yours, guys. Thank you.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.667
I feel like I did something
here to help the environment

15:31.702 --> 15:33.368
by sellin' those comics, right?

15:33.404 --> 15:35.470
Were... were they on recycled paper?

15:35.506 --> 15:37.506
- I don't think so.
- No, I'm just-without me,

15:37.541 --> 15:39.408
those kids might not have
gotten to read those books

15:39.443 --> 15:42.844
at the library and grown
up to be green and clean.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.379
Right, it's not about
the librarian at all.

15:44.415 --> 15:45.547
- It's all about you.
- Yeah, hey, good job.

15:45.582 --> 15:47.082
- Good job, man.
- Good job.

15:47.117 --> 15:48.850
- You're a hero.
- Captain Planet right here.

15:48.886 --> 15:49.985
[all laughing]

15:50.020 --> 15:51.019
There you go. There you go.

15:51.055 --> 15:52.387
- Wax on.
- Clockwise.

15:52.423 --> 15:53.922
- Okay. Counterclockwise.
- Then wax off.

15:53.958 --> 15:56.058
Look at that, you could
chew bubblegum and walk

15:56.093 --> 15:58.393
- at the same time.
- Oh, let's not get crazy.

16:06.548 --> 16:07.980
I just got a text from Robert.

16:08.016 --> 16:09.515
He's got the Competition Center,

16:09.551 --> 16:11.017
and he'll be here in 20 minutes.

16:11.052 --> 16:12.618
All right. All right.

16:12.654 --> 16:14.320
- I told you.
- The man delivers.

16:14.355 --> 16:15.488
While-while you're here,

16:15.523 --> 16:17.123
and I know this sounds weird,

16:17.158 --> 16:19.659
but "Karate Kid" had all
that martial arts philosophy,

16:19.694 --> 16:21.194
accomplishing
bettering yourself

16:21.229 --> 16:23.029
through mundane tasks.

16:23.064 --> 16:24.797
Um, you know, I kinda do a lot
of mundane tasks around here.

16:24.833 --> 16:26.933
I'm stocking shelves. I'm folding shirts.

16:26.968 --> 16:28.334
I'm wiping down this counter.

16:28.369 --> 16:29.602
Is there any of that
martial arts philosophy

16:29.637 --> 16:31.204
you might be able to imbue on me?

16:31.239 --> 16:33.306
Maybe-maybe, you know, help
me do a better job here?

16:33.341 --> 16:34.507
Can you... can you better yourself

16:34.542 --> 16:35.842
through mundane conversation?

16:35.877 --> 16:37.343
[all laughing]

16:37.378 --> 16:39.212
We're gonna call him Ming-yagi.

16:39.247 --> 16:41.547
How's that? How's that?

16:41.583 --> 16:43.649
How cool was it to have the Karate Kid,

16:43.685 --> 16:46.152
Ralph Macchio, at the
Stash at our disposal,

16:46.187 --> 16:48.488
just to pepper him with so
many questions like that?

16:48.523 --> 16:50.056
It... it was amazing. Never did I think

16:50.091 --> 16:51.724
I would see the day.
And-and-and I got

16:51.759 --> 16:53.626
a new, cool nickname now: Ming-yagi.

16:53.661 --> 16:55.795
Really? I like your old
nickname better: asshat.

16:55.830 --> 16:57.330
[laughing]

16:57.365 --> 16:58.965
Didn't have quite the same ring, but...

16:59.000 --> 17:01.200
[all laughing]

17:01.236 --> 17:02.969
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but I... I mean,

17:03.004 --> 17:04.737
take this counter, for example.

17:04.771 --> 17:06.405
I'm-I'm always having
problems keepin' it clean.

17:06.441 --> 17:07.973
These guys are always
putting fingerprints on it.

17:08.009 --> 17:09.342
You know, I know you did the
you know,

17:09.377 --> 17:10.843
there's the wax on, wax off, and-

17:10.878 --> 17:12.078
and in the movie, you know, I know it-

17:12.113 --> 17:13.346
it was very specific.

17:13.381 --> 17:15.548
Wax on.

17:15.583 --> 17:17.517
Right hand make a circle.

17:17.551 --> 17:18.651
Wax off.

17:18.685 --> 17:20.520
Left hand circle.

17:20.555 --> 17:21.887
- Which way to do it...
- Now which was-which hand

17:21.923 --> 17:23.356
was on, and which one was wax off?

17:23.391 --> 17:25.258
I think if... if I remember correctly...

17:25.292 --> 17:27.160
- Go ahead.
- I believe this was on, right?

17:27.194 --> 17:28.594
And this was off. Am I right?

17:28.630 --> 17:29.896
No, you had a 50/50
shot, and you blew it.

17:29.931 --> 17:31.230
I blew it? It was this one?

17:31.266 --> 17:32.865
- You blew it.
- Okay, see, this is...

17:32.901 --> 17:34.100
- Hold on, hold on, here.
- I'm right-handed.

17:34.135 --> 17:35.334
- Show him.
- There you go.

17:35.370 --> 17:36.569
I know it was just a movie,

17:36.604 --> 17:38.037
but while I had him in front of me,

17:38.072 --> 17:39.739
I- I-I thought maybe
he could, you know,

17:39.774 --> 17:41.340
teach me the technique of, uh, you know,

17:41.376 --> 17:42.742
waxing on and waxing off.

17:42.777 --> 17:44.277
Maybe some of the stuff that he learned

17:44.312 --> 17:46.179
from the master Mr. Miyagi in the movie.

17:46.214 --> 17:47.780
I'm sure he was like, "This is worse

17:47.815 --> 17:49.382
than gettin' my leg swept. "

17:49.417 --> 17:51.584
[all laughing]

17:51.619 --> 17:53.085
- Okay, this is wax on.
- Right.

17:53.121 --> 17:54.520
And then you go wax off with this one.

17:54.556 --> 17:55.855
- And the-this-this-
- Counterclockwise.

17:55.890 --> 17:57.023
- This way? Counterclockwise.
- No.

17:57.058 --> 17:58.124
- Here, here.
- Okay.

17:58.159 --> 17:59.625
- Oh, oh, oh.
- [laughing]

17:59.661 --> 18:01.060
- Don't get excited, now.
- Okay, okay.

18:01.095 --> 18:02.795
- So you go-you go...
- Okay.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.730
- There you go, clockwise.
- Okay, wax on. Okay.

18:04.766 --> 18:06.098
And wax off, let's see what you do.

18:06.134 --> 18:07.366
- I
- both: Counterclockwise.

18:07.402 --> 18:09.068
Look at that, you could chew bubblegum

18:09.103 --> 18:10.069
and walk at the same time.

18:10.104 --> 18:11.470
Oh, let's not get crazy.

18:11.506 --> 18:12.939
You can't do it at the same time?

18:12.974 --> 18:14.307
So how we doi" on that 20 minutes?

18:14.342 --> 18:15.975
[all laughing]

18:16.010 --> 18:17.577
Look. Look at how clean this is.

18:17.612 --> 18:19.212
It was beyond cringeworthy.

18:19.247 --> 18:21.781
I mean, you just wanted so
badly for him to say the phrase,

18:21.816 --> 18:25.384
"Wax on, wax off," that you came
up with some harebrained scheme

18:25.420 --> 18:27.286
as, like, you couldn't
keep the counter clean.

18:27.322 --> 18:28.321
I think he thought you were simple.

18:28.356 --> 18:29.555
[laughing]

18:29.591 --> 18:30.556
He was right.

18:30.592 --> 18:31.991
[all laughing]

18:32.026 --> 18:33.125
Oh, he's here. Uh, Ralph.

18:33.161 --> 18:34.393
- Yeah?
- He's here.

18:34.429 --> 18:36.128
- Hey, Walt.
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

18:36.164 --> 18:37.563
- Good job.
- Sorry it took me so long, man.

18:37.599 --> 18:38.798
It's okay.

18:38.833 --> 18:39.832
- Huh?
- How you doin', man?

18:39.867 --> 18:41.100
Hey, Robert Bruce.

18:41.135 --> 18:42.435
- This is awesome.
- How are ya?

18:42.470 --> 18:44.070
- He said he had a guy.
- Yeah.

18:44.105 --> 18:45.838
He's got a guy. And here's the item.

18:45.873 --> 18:48.174
That's crazy. The reason
why I needed this one

18:48.209 --> 18:49.976
with the-first of all, there's
not many of these, right?

18:50.011 --> 18:51.277
- No, impossible.
- I mean, you'll attest to that.

18:51.312 --> 18:53.312
But-but the thing...
this referee...

18:53.348 --> 18:54.981
first of all, it-it
cr- it cracks me up,

18:55.016 --> 18:56.515
because he's in a white
shirt when in the movie,

18:56.551 --> 18:58.084
- he was wearin' what color shirt?
- Red.

18:58.119 --> 18:59.452
Red shirt. All right, good.

18:59.487 --> 19:01.254
I like-I like the little classroom things.

19:01.289 --> 19:02.788
- Raise your hand first next time.
- I'm sorry.

19:02.824 --> 19:03.956
- Raise your hand.
- I'm sorry. I'm just...

19:03.992 --> 19:05.424
I'm excited.
- But, um,

19:05.460 --> 19:07.860
this character was played by Pat Johnson,

19:07.895 --> 19:10.830
who did all the fight
choreography in the movie,

19:10.865 --> 19:12.932
so any of the fight scenes
that were done in the movie,

19:12.967 --> 19:15.268
it was choreographed by him.
He was our stunt coordinator

19:15.303 --> 19:16.936
and, uh, martial arts guru, and-

19:16.971 --> 19:18.537
Only way you could get his figure too.

19:18.573 --> 19:21.173
- This was-yeah,
see how they have-

19:21.209 --> 19:22.708
oh, the got the whole ch-

19:22.744 --> 19:24.210
crowd cheerin'.

19:24.245 --> 19:25.678
Oh, they cut
- you could actually cut it out.

19:25.713 --> 19:27.313
I mean, I wouldn't touch it, man.

19:27.348 --> 19:29.148
I'd leave it like it is.
Let-let my grandchildren,

19:29.183 --> 19:31.350
uh, cut it up and-and use it.

19:31.386 --> 19:33.019
I'm so lucky. This is awesome, man.

19:33.054 --> 19:34.854
This is a home run.
What do I owe you for it?

19:34.889 --> 19:36.455
Well, it took me some time to find it.

19:36.491 --> 19:38.391
I had to-gas and tolls,

19:38.426 --> 19:41.227
and I'd like to get, uh, $320.

19:41.262 --> 19:43.129
- All right.
- Come on, Robert.

19:43.164 --> 19:45.164
- Seriously?
- His face is on the box.

19:45.199 --> 19:46.699
I mean, I'm... I'm not including my fee.

19:46.734 --> 19:47.700
You know, usually I have
a fee for running around.

19:47.735 --> 19:49.235
All right, listen, guys-

19:49.270 --> 19:50.836
guys, I came in to get
this. Whatever it is, it is.

19:50.872 --> 19:51.904
- But still.
- I mean, it's a-it's a-

19:51.939 --> 19:53.306
- What?
- You know, you gotta do

19:53.341 --> 19:54.907
- better than that. I mean...
- All right.

19:54.942 --> 19:56.375
Come on, look who you're sellin' it to.

19:56.411 --> 19:58.377
- All right, I mean, Walt's
- Walt's house.

19:58.413 --> 19:59.512
It's factory sealed.

19:59.547 --> 20:00.880
I could do $300.

20:00.915 --> 20:04.350
I know you can do better than that.

20:04.385 --> 20:05.551
Listen, $300's fine.

20:05.586 --> 20:07.253
No, no, no, no. Walt's right.

20:07.288 --> 20:08.721
- Do a little bit better.
- Walt's 100% correct.

20:08.756 --> 20:12.024
So $250 would be, like, my rock.

20:12.060 --> 20:13.492
- $250. That...
- That'll make it $10.

20:13.528 --> 20:14.860
Listen, this is a home run for me.

20:14.896 --> 20:17.196
We've had fun for 58 minutes.

20:17.231 --> 20:18.364
[all laughing]

20:18.399 --> 20:19.665
$250's fair.

20:19.701 --> 20:21.434
$250. Lunch in Jersey right here.

20:21.469 --> 20:22.902
For me. I don't know-

20:22.937 --> 20:24.236
- I'm not bringin' everybody.
- Aww.

20:24.272 --> 20:25.538
It was a pleasure to have you here.

20:25.573 --> 20:27.006
This is awesome, man. Thank you.

20:27.041 --> 20:28.441
- You're welcome.
- Thanks very much.

20:28.476 --> 20:29.875
- See you later, man.
- All right, thank you.

20:29.911 --> 20:31.911
- Thank you.
- You got it. Thanks, guys.

20:31.946 --> 20:33.579
Where do you get off
tryin' to charge him

20:33.614 --> 20:34.847
tolls and gas when everyone knows

20:34.882 --> 20:36.082
you ride a bike?

20:36.117 --> 20:37.683
[all laughing]

20:37.719 --> 20:39.192
A boy plays a legend.

20:39.227 --> 20:40.631
A boy becomes a man.

20:40.666 --> 20:42.759
That man comes into our store,

20:42.794 --> 20:45.955
and you helpin' findin' somethink
from when he was a boy.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.655
That's circle, all circle right there.

20:48.690 --> 20:50.728
antian easter filosofy, right?

20:52.422 --> 20:55.595
Well, we have a good time wax on,
but is time to wax off.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.035
From Comic Book Men.

21:00.033 --> 21:01.842
Strike hard.

21:01.877 --> 21:03.515
No mercy, sir.
Good Night.
