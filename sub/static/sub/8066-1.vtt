00:25.125 --> 00:29.005
M-O-N-S-T-E-R
Monsters, Monsters, yes, we are.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.235
<i>Hey, Frankie's
got me fallin' apart.</i>

00:31.331 --> 00:33.004
<i>Draculaura's stealin' my heart.</i>

00:33.066 --> 00:34.977
<i>Clawdeen Wolf
You make me howl at the moon.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:37.015
<i>Lagoona, you're the finest
fish in this lagoon.</i>

00:37.070 --> 00:40.916
<i>Cleo de Nile, you so beguile
Even though you act so vile.</i>

00:41.008 --> 00:42.487
<i>These are my boos
My skeleton crew.</i>

00:42.543 --> 00:45.023
<i>A little strange But so are you.</i>

00:45.078 --> 00:46.921
<i>Don't you wanna
be</i> a <i>monster, too?</i>

00:57.524 --> 00:58.832
Uninspired.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.270
Unimpressive. Ridiculous.

01:01.361 --> 01:02.533
So over.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.736
So over my un-dead body!

01:05.832 --> 01:08.039
This is what you give to me,

01:08.101 --> 01:11.275
the great Moanatella Ghostier?

01:11.371 --> 01:12.406
Monsters.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.077
They are dying to
see my new ideas.

01:16.276 --> 01:18.847
If I do not wow the press
with my newline,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.789
<i>I</i> could

01:20.881 --> 01:22.554
disappear forever!

01:22.916 --> 01:26.022
Come, we need to
find some new blood.

01:42.636 --> 01:48.587
This is the most impossible math
problem known to man or monster.

01:48.642 --> 01:53.785
Whomever solves it will be forever
remembered throughout history.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.588
Oh, this is so awesome!
I could be famous.

01:57.718 --> 02:01.791
Ooh, Clawdeen,
today is the big day!

02:01.888 --> 02:02.992
Ahem.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.996
Ah, for math.
Ah, big day for math. Yay.

02:09.596 --> 02:10.734
Aren't you excited?

02:10.797 --> 02:13.437
I'm so nervous
my fur is standing up.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.107
Relax, you did a voltageous
job designing our outfits.

02:17.170 --> 02:21.016
They're so awesome Moanatella
Ghostier should idolize you.

02:21.108 --> 02:24.612
Who is this
Moanatella Ghostier?

02:24.678 --> 02:28.649
Duh, only the world's most
legendary fashion designer.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.695
I don't see why we have to
wait until the bell rings.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.958
The people deserve
to see me now.

02:34.021 --> 02:37.127
Cleo, the bell rings, it's go time.
That's the whole point.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.794
Abbey, we good on music?

02:38.859 --> 02:42.864
Have two choices,
fun upbeat rock with roll,

02:42.963 --> 02:47.673
or greatest hits of
Himalayan Yak Band! Huh?

02:47.768 --> 02:49.645
Uh, let's go with
the first one.

02:49.803 --> 02:50.804
Hmm?

02:52.105 --> 02:54.346
Ooh! Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man!

02:54.441 --> 02:57.320
Mr. Rotter, sir.
I figured it out! It's...

02:58.478 --> 03:00.685
Time for a Flashion Mob!

03:03.684 --> 03:06.028
Oh, no.

03:06.119 --> 03:09.032
Whoa! Yeah! Sweet music!

03:09.122 --> 03:11.796
Time for Holt Hyde
to bring the noise!

03:13.460 --> 03:15.235
Let's go, ghouls!

03:15.328 --> 03:19.242
Please' Holt Hyde, you are
not to run in the halls.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.979
om.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.482
What's the meanin'
of all this? Oi!

04:05.746 --> 04:07.919
Looking great, ghouls!

04:08.014 --> 04:11.689
This outfit is made from
all renewable resources!

04:13.787 --> 04:16.267
Don't invite me, huh?

04:17.390 --> 04:19.961
Time for this kitty to scratch.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.768
Hey, you guys gotta hurry.
It's almost over!

04:22.863 --> 04:24.604
Yeah. Let's do this!

04:24.698 --> 04:26.541
Uh, which one's mine?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.383
I don't know about this.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.328
Heath, what are you doing?

04:46.419 --> 04:48.296
I'm doing my best.

04:48.388 --> 04:51.096
I don't know how you
ghouls walk in these! Oh!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.301
A-ha.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.289
Sorry.

05:11.344 --> 05:14.120
It's just that you're,
like, totally famous now!

05:14.181 --> 05:16.821
What are you
talking about, Spectra?

05:16.917 --> 05:19.523
Hey, big sis, check it out.

05:19.619 --> 05:22.657
The video of your Flashion Mob
is going viral.

05:22.756 --> 05:23.826
Nice' sis! Way to go!

05:23.924 --> 05:25.028
Fin-tastic!

05:25.125 --> 05:27.127
But I didn't... You're welcome.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.333
Ghoulia took everyone's
cell phone videos,

05:29.429 --> 05:32.672
edited out that awkward last bit
and uploaded it to FrightTube!

05:32.766 --> 05:35.110
Ugh! Well, what if
someone sees this?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.476
Someone?

05:36.536 --> 05:38.447
It's got, like, a jillion hits!

05:39.773 --> 05:42.049
I know that's not
a real number, Ghoulia.

05:42.142 --> 05:45.055
Maybe I just bad
at reading faces,

05:45.145 --> 05:47.182
but she not seem happy.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.818
High fashion is
all about these rules

05:50.884 --> 05:54.195
of strict form and design.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.666
And I broke most of those
rules with my freaky outfits.

05:57.724 --> 06:01.137
We gotta take this down before
anyone important sees this.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.900
I need to find
myself a new apprentice.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.807
No. No.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.871
<i>Oui!</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:13.373
No.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.809
No. Heavens, no.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.048
<i>Oui!</i>

06:18.478 --> 06:21.357
No! No, no, no, no!

06:21.414 --> 06:23.223
I believe we are done here.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.523
We have two
potential successors.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.065
Stop! This one,

06:29.656 --> 06:31.329
I must have.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.831
Thanks, Ghoulia.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.705
I can't believe she did that

06:37.764 --> 06:39.402
I thought it was,
like, impossible

06:39.499 --> 06:41.069
to take something
off the Internet.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.376
No, I meant all of that
beautiful footage of me,

06:44.437 --> 06:45.916
gone forever.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.406
Look, I'm just
glad we pulled it off

06:47.407 --> 06:48.750
without anybody getting busted.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.119
<i>Clawdeen Wolf, you
and your Flashlon Mob ghoul friends</i>

06:52.212 --> 06:54.886
<i>are to report to
my office immediately.</i>

06:54.948 --> 06:58.054
About that little stunt
you pulled yesterday...

06:58.118 --> 07:00.428
Headmistress Bloodgood,
I can explain.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.897
See, it was... Incredible!

07:01.955 --> 07:05.767
I was watching it nonstop until
someone pulled the video.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.567
So, we're not in trouble?

07:08.628 --> 07:09.936
Oh, no.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.910
In fact' it turns out I wasn't
the only one watching.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.379
Guess who I just got
off the phone with?

07:16.436 --> 07:19.042
Lead jug player from
Himalayan Yak Band!

07:19.139 --> 07:21.278
Uh, no.  Oh.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.784
Moanatella Ghostier!

07:23.877 --> 07:27.791
She wants you to come to Scaris
to study fashion under her!

07:27.881 --> 07:29.292
No way! So awesome!

07:29.382 --> 07:30.383
Amazing! So fabulous!

07:30.450 --> 07:31.827
Scaris?

07:31.918 --> 07:34.990
Moanatella Ghostier?

07:35.088 --> 07:39.332
Oh, pinch my fur, 'cause I am dreaming!

07:39.893 --> 07:41.429
You leave tomorrow.

07:41.494 --> 07:43.440
And since Rochelle
grew up there,

07:43.496 --> 07:46.477
I've asked her to accompany
you as your guide.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.739
I know every part
of that beautiful

07:48.802 --> 07:50.907
and romantic city like
the back of my hand.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.077
And my grandmother,
she will watch over us.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.983
<i>She has been doing it forever.</i>

07:56.076 --> 07:57.146
Wait,
wait, <i>wait, wait.</i>

07:57.243 --> 08:00.156
I mean, this all
sounds amazing,

08:00.246 --> 08:02.157
but what about my ghouls?

08:02.248 --> 08:04.592
I couldn't have done
any of this without them.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.857
Can they come with me?
Oh, please.

08:05.952 --> 08:06.987
Yeah! Say yes.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.191
And you know I don't beg.

08:08.288 --> 08:12.964
Remember, Scaris is the
cultural center of the world.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.496
And it would be an amazing
educational opportunity.

08:16.596 --> 08:17.973
For all of us.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.036
It is no bother.
We have the room.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.283
Okay. Everyone can go!

08:28.641 --> 08:29.676
Shopping!

08:29.776 --> 08:31.346
I get to go on a plane!

08:31.511 --> 08:33.683
Ah! Wait, wait!

08:33.780 --> 08:34.850
This is terrible.

08:34.948 --> 08:35.892
Why?

08:35.982 --> 08:40.328
We have less than 24 hours to
pack and plan all of our outfits!

08:40.386 --> 08:41.695
We gotta move!

08:44.290 --> 08:46.998
Ahem. Oops. Sorry!

08:49.129 --> 08:50.130
Whoa!

08:52.298 --> 08:53.299
Hmm.

08:53.733 --> 08:54.905
Awesome, right?

08:55.001 --> 08:56.173
Scaris, baby!

08:57.203 --> 08:58.375
No.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.848
Yes. Yes. Yes.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.350
Obviously, yes!

09:03.410 --> 09:04.411
Whoa!

09:05.645 --> 09:06.680
Hey, Clawdeen!

09:06.746 --> 09:08.885
Hey' Draculaura,
how many bags you taking?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.893
Um... All of them?

09:10.984 --> 09:11.984
Me too!

09:12.018 --> 09:13.053
Oh! It's Cleo.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.327
Tell me the truth, is 45
pairs of shoes enough?

09:16.423 --> 09:19.768
I mean, we are there for a whole week.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.065
Hey, Lagoona.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.333
Question, hats still in
this season?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.170
I'd really love to
bring all me hats.

09:24.230 --> 09:28.406
Are they still running
special, "Yaks fly for free"?

09:28.501 --> 09:31.880
I just talked to my grand-mere,
the weather is perfect!

09:31.938 --> 09:33.383
Dark and stormy!

09:33.440 --> 09:34.851
Yes! Faux fur fo' sho!

09:34.908 --> 09:36.285
Guys! What's going on?

09:36.376 --> 09:37.912
What?
We're gonna miss our flight!

09:38.011 --> 09:39.615
Gotta jet! Let's go!

09:40.080 --> 09:43.926
Final boarding call
for ﬂight 190 to Skull Shores.

09:44.017 --> 09:48.261
<i>Would Tiki passengers Yuk Tuk.
Tiki Tuk, Nick Puk and Dave</i>

09:48.354 --> 09:50.197
<i>please report to
the airline desk.</i>

09:50.256 --> 09:53.931
Man, what'd you guys do,
bring your whole closets?

09:54.027 --> 09:55.597
You know it! Totally!

09:55.695 --> 09:58.539
Check out Heath, he's about to flame
out with one little suitcase.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.110
I got it!

10:04.604 --> 10:06.777
Ghoulia,
what do you got in this,

10:06.873 --> 10:08.978
it weighs a monster ton!

10:10.710 --> 10:12.246
You brought your scooter?
No way!

10:12.312 --> 10:13.950
How did you get that in there?

10:14.047 --> 10:16.584
Everyone in Scaris
rides the scooters.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.788
It is trés chic.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.058
Come on! They're
boarding without us!

10:21.121 --> 10:23.465
Cheers, mate! Bye!

10:32.065 --> 10:34.841
You know, I'm totally stoked for
Draculaura gettin' to go to Scaris.

10:34.934 --> 10:35.935
Yeah, dude.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.744
I'm totally stoked for myself!

10:38.805 --> 10:39.806
What?

10:39.906 --> 10:42.477
A whole week without Cleo
checking up on me.

10:42.575 --> 10:47.285
That's right, brosefs! We don't
need any chicks crampin' our style.

10:47.347 --> 10:51.989
There's no time, like bro
time, am I right, my dudes'?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.928
Whoo! Up top!

10:54.954 --> 10:56.763
Up top! Ow!

10:58.024 --> 10:59.094
Huh?

11:01.928 --> 11:04.841
Oh! I am so
voltageously excited,

11:04.931 --> 11:07.275
I think I might blow my circuits!

11:16.676 --> 11:18.212
Sorry!

11:19.445 --> 11:22.892
So, you must really be sparked
about going home, Rochelle.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.656
Oui, Frankie.
It has been too long.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.629
Hey! Whatcha readin'?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.861
They are old letters from my
first boyfriend, Garrett.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.961
Oh, this is so beautiful!

11:34.027 --> 11:38.976
Oui. Garrett is the most
romantic boy I have ever met.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.512
And so cute, too!

11:41.868 --> 11:43.814
So poetic.

11:43.870 --> 11:48.478
Boys from Scaris are much more in
touch with their artistic side.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.215
He really knows a lot
about fashion and clothes.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.724
Garrott was the most
creative of them all.

11:54.814 --> 11:57.420
He even designed
his own rose bush,

11:57.517 --> 12:00.157
to grow roses unlike any other.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.723
<i>So</i> that each
time he gave me one,

12:02.822 --> 12:05.268
I would know how
special I was to him.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.099
Oh, my ghoul,

12:07.193 --> 12:11.403
this guy sounds like all
that and a bag of bolts!

12:11.497 --> 12:14.034
Tell me you're gonna see him
while we're in Scaris.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.704
Oh, alas, I cannot.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.505
He does not love me anymore.

12:18.771 --> 12:22.048
What?
These letters, they are old.

12:22.108 --> 12:25.555
Some time ago,
they just stopped coming.

12:25.612 --> 12:29.924
He must have
found someone else.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.121
Wait a second!
You're telling me that

12:32.218 --> 12:34.289
the boy who wrote
you these letters,

12:34.387 --> 12:36.958
the boy who invented
his own rose bush for you,

12:37.056 --> 12:38.865
just found somebody else?

12:39.125 --> 12:41.196
Uh-uh. I don't believe it.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.468
We've got his address.
When we get to Scaris,

12:45.565 --> 12:48.375
we're going to go find him
and see what happened!

12:56.242 --> 12:58.779
Abbey, did you sneak
a yak on the plane?

12:58.878 --> 13:03.327
No, he get air sick.
Found that out hard way.

13:05.551 --> 13:09.795
Toralei, you stowaway kitty!
What are you doing here?

13:09.889 --> 13:13.894
If you think I was going
to just hang at Monster High

13:13.960 --> 13:16.600
while you ghouls were
having fun in Scaris,

13:16.663 --> 13:18.336
then you got
another fang coming.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.241
Why do you have to try and
ruin everything we do'?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.474
I'm not trying
to ruin anything.

13:23.569 --> 13:24.775
Yeah. Sure, mate.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.282
You know what? It's fine.

13:26.339 --> 13:31.288
Scaris is a big place, no reason
we have to see her at all.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.814
You do your thing,
we'll do ours, 'kay?

13:34.914 --> 13:36.257
Fine.

13:38.584 --> 13:41.588
Things like this never
happen in first class.

13:44.590 --> 13:45.933
I'm just not used to seeing

13:45.992 --> 13:49.439
big, bad Clawdeen Wolf
worried like this.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.477
Madame Ghostier is my idol.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.514
I've been following her
career since I was little.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.604
She's going to love you.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.309
I don't know.

14:00.373 --> 14:04.344
Fashion's about rules, I've
always done things my own way.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.947
Listen, she's going
to figure out

14:07.013 --> 14:09.459
what the rest of
us already know,

14:09.515 --> 14:13.827
that you are
an amazing designer.

14:13.886 --> 14:16.560
You're just sayin'
that to make me feel better.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.466
When was the
last time you heard me

14:19.525 --> 14:21.505
say something to
make anyone feel better?

14:21.561 --> 14:23.666
Well, I hope
you're right.

14:23.730 --> 14:27.701
'Cause this ain't the halls
of Monster High anymore.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.644
Scaris is the big time.

14:32.638 --> 14:35.050
That's right,
my phantom feline.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.815
They're almost here,
the new blood,

14:37.877 --> 14:41.552
the new ideas that I need
to keep me where I belong,

14:41.647 --> 14:43.092
the top!

14:43.983 --> 14:45.826
And not a moment too soon.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.434
<i>Et bien, grand-mére.
We are</i> off!

14:59.899 --> 15:01.901
Ghoulia and I
need to help Rochelle

15:02.168 --> 15:04.273
uh, find something she's lost.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.214
You ghouls are free
to explore the city.

15:07.273 --> 15:10.117
You can take our
family automobile. Ooh!

15:10.843 --> 15:12.550
I have been gone a long time.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.613
Don't fret, love.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.124
It's a fin-tastic day.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.955
We'll take a nice walk,
drop Clawdeen off

15:17.049 --> 15:18.722
and do some fright-seeing.

15:18.785 --> 15:22.961
Scaris is a very big place, I
don't want anyone to get lost.

15:23.055 --> 15:24.534
I do.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.763
You must promise me that you
will all stay together.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.541
Hang on, guys,
better check my phone.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.374
Cleo has probably left,
like, a dozen messages.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.608
Huh? Nothing.

15:37.703 --> 15:38.943
Weird.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.308
Hey, from Draculaura.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.318
It's a bunch of
pics from Scaris.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.116
Whoa! That place
looks sick, bro.

15:45.211 --> 15:48.715
Draculaura is in the most
romantic city in the world

15:48.781 --> 15:51.421
with the most romantic
dudes in the world.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.657
Hah! I'd be, like,
mega jealous. Props, brah!

15:56.222 --> 15:57.792
Thanks. Dude, it's Draculaura.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.564
You guys are solid as stone.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.731
Yeah. Totally.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.634
It does not look like he's
lived here in along, longtime.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.269
We tried our best, Frankie.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.313
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:10.403 --> 16:14.442
Fang on a second! You can't
give up on true love!

16:14.507 --> 16:18.319
But Scaris is so large. There
is no way we can find him.

16:18.411 --> 16:22.188
You have his letters,
his hopes, his dreams,

16:22.281 --> 16:24.761
all his favorite places!

16:24.817 --> 16:27.764
You are the genius,
Frankie!

16:28.588 --> 16:29.760
Let us ride!

16:31.023 --> 16:32.331
Whoa!

16:33.926 --> 16:36.372
Isn't this city is to die for?

16:36.462 --> 16:39.341
O-M-Ghoul,
is that what I think it is?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.878
Moanatella Ghostiers
headquarters!

16:43.302 --> 16:44.679
Oh, my ghoul! Whoa.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.344
You totally got this.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.647
Now go knock her dead...

16:49.709 --> 16:51.848
Uh... Undead.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.685
<i>Bonne chance, mon amie.</i>

16:53.779 --> 16:55.281
Break leg. Goodbye!

16:55.348 --> 16:56.622
Cheers, mate.

16:57.950 --> 17:02.524
Clawdeen Wolf here
to see Madame Ghostier.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.193
You, girl we've never heard of.

17:05.290 --> 17:08.670
You can tell us anything
about Madame's new line?

17:10.630 --> 17:13.873
Ma fille, you are never
to talk to those animals.

17:13.965 --> 17:17.378
I will not answer any questions
about my new clothing line!

17:18.538 --> 17:21.883
I will permit you to bask
in my glory.“

17:21.973 --> 17:23.385
Can you believe it?

17:23.476 --> 17:25.251
The Moanatella Ghostier!

17:25.344 --> 17:29.724
I just love your outfit!
Tienes some killer style!

17:29.815 --> 17:32.091
You too! I'm...

17:32.251 --> 17:33.355
Oh, no. My shirt!

17:33.419 --> 17:34.864
Here, let me help.

17:36.689 --> 17:37.724
Whoa!

17:38.057 --> 17:41.038
That's furrific!
Thanks! I'm Clawdeen.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.094
Skelita.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.441
Are you ghouls here to
study under her, too?

17:44.530 --> 17:45.565
Oh, yes.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.509
This is Jinafire,
she is super talented.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.013
Show her. Hmm...

17:56.275 --> 17:57.276
Whoa!

17:57.610 --> 17:59.385
Now, can we get to work?

17:59.845 --> 18:01.882
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.518
I do not want to waste it.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.923
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.363
One of you will
have a chance lo learn

18:09.422 --> 18:11.629
everything I know
about haunt couture.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.726
Only one of us'? Oui.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.467
Consider this
a fashion boot camp.

18:16.562 --> 18:20.100
At the end, one of you
will become my apprentice.

18:20.199 --> 18:24.238
The others will be tossed to the
curb like last season's collection.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.475
Follow me.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.948
This is where you will work.

18:28.040 --> 18:32.045
Where you will take everything I
teach you and bring it to life.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.419
Whoa!

18:33.813 --> 18:35.451
For your first assignment,

18:35.548 --> 18:37.459
you will have
30 minutes to design

18:37.550 --> 18:41.896
the most elegant, regal,
and amazing outfit for

18:42.555 --> 18:44.762
my cat.

18:44.824 --> 18:45.825
A cat?

18:49.762 --> 18:52.572
So, what do you
girls wanna see first?

18:52.632 --> 18:55.340
The Eiffel Terror,
Ogre-Dame Cathedral...

18:55.434 --> 18:59.007
So much history here.
It's older than I am!

18:59.105 --> 19:01.449
We're in the fashion
capital of the world

19:01.507 --> 19:04.647
and you ghouls wanna
learn stuff?

19:04.744 --> 19:07.122
This Kitty's going shopping.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.125
But we supposed
to stick together.

19:09.181 --> 19:12.321
Then I guess we're
all going shopping.

19:12.418 --> 19:15.422
Ugh! I have never
been more angry

19:15.488 --> 19:17.968
to buy things in my life.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.436
Normally I don't go for cats, but
designing for them is actually fun.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.168
Oh, you haven't started yet.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.303
I need inspiration to create.

19:29.368 --> 19:32.941
And for me, mi <i>familia</i>
is my greatest source.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.814
These belonged to mi abuelita.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.074
Shh.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.490
You need inspiration, too?

19:39.645 --> 19:41.818
I am almost done.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.893
The magic is in the planning.

19:43.983 --> 19:47.055
I never draw a single
line until I am sure.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.326
Hmm. Perfect.

19:52.224 --> 19:53.225
Ta-da!

19:53.626 --> 19:54.627
Whoa!

19:58.798 --> 19:59.998
His name is Garrett.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.036
If you see him,
s'il vous plait, call me.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.204
Rochelle!

20:03.302 --> 20:04.838
Isn't that
the exact leather jacket.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.383
Garrott was wearing
in the picture?

20:06.472 --> 20:07.473
After him!

20:10.076 --> 20:12.147
My dearest designers,

20:12.211 --> 20:16.091
all of your concepts
were bold, unique,

20:16.182 --> 20:18.355
and hideous!

20:18.417 --> 20:21.330
Do any of these look
like Ghostier designs?

20:21.387 --> 20:22.923
I think not!

20:23.022 --> 20:26.697
<i>Mademoiselle Clawdeen,</i>
I <i>had such</i> high <i>hopes for you.</i>

20:26.759 --> 20:27.999
Defend your work!

20:28.094 --> 20:31.337
Oh. Well, Madame,
I just thought feathers

20:31.397 --> 20:33.035
'cause cats chase birds, and...

20:33.099 --> 20:34.510
Enough!

20:35.267 --> 20:37.907
Under your desks
are brand-new design books.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.914
You will throw
away your old one

20:40.005 --> 20:42.076
and fill this one
with what I teach you.

20:42.174 --> 20:45.678
The ghoul with the best book will
be chosen as my new apprentice.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.689
I suggest you leave
your old style to history,

20:49.749 --> 20:53.196
or else you will be history.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.062
Just try and keep up, ah?

21:08.534 --> 21:11.105
Oh, no. We'll never catch him.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.409
Ah! Shortcut!

21:15.708 --> 21:17.449
What is this place?

21:17.543 --> 21:19.420
These are the catacombs
of Scaris.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.552
A series of passageways
that stretch

21:22.615 --> 21:25.118
for miles deep
underneath the city.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.164
Some of the areas are
hundreds of years old.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.790
What's with all the skeletons?

21:29.889 --> 21:30.959
'Tis where they sleep.

21:32.792 --> 21:33.930
Sorry!

21:37.997 --> 21:39.999
No, stop!

21:40.666 --> 21:42.111
That area is forbidden.

21:42.168 --> 21:45.172
They say that monsters
who venture down there

21:45.271 --> 21:47.251
are never heard from again.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.081
We will go this way.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.256
He is over there!

21:55.314 --> 21:56.315
Watch out!

22:02.822 --> 22:03.823
Ooh!

22:03.923 --> 22:05.266
Garrett?

22:05.491 --> 22:06.834
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>

22:06.926 --> 22:09.202
Ooh, please forgive me.

22:11.864 --> 22:12.865
Oh!

22:17.203 --> 22:20.616
I don't know what to get. Cleo
always picks out my lunch for me.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.811
Whoa!

22:21.874 --> 22:25.287
I've been doing some research. You
were right about Scaris, bro.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.119
Told ya! So what, dude?

22:27.179 --> 22:30.126
So what? That place
is super romantic

22:30.182 --> 22:31.525
I can't compete.

22:31.617 --> 22:32.652
It's gonna to be fine.

22:32.718 --> 22:36.860
Yeah, I'm sure that thing with
Valentine was a freak event.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.030
I know!
I gotta go talk to Cupid.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.365
She'll know what to do.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.863
Where do you
ghouls want to go next?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.203
Oh, Oh! The museum!

22:45.297 --> 22:47.709
Who wants to go to the Boo-we?

22:47.800 --> 22:48.870
No.

22:48.968 --> 22:52.245
It's pronounced Bouvre.

22:52.338 --> 22:53.715
<i>The Bower'? Bouvre.</i>

22:53.806 --> 22:55.046
Boov... Bouvre.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.551
Boo-var... Boo-boo... Bouvre!

22:56.642 --> 22:58.315
Who cares?

22:58.377 --> 23:01.847
Who wants to see a bunch of
oldie, moldy statues and stuff'?

23:02.381 --> 23:04.383
What's your deal?

23:04.483 --> 23:05.894
Why is my coffee so small?

23:05.985 --> 23:08.056
Toralei, it's an espresso.

23:08.153 --> 23:11.532
Take this tiny coffee back right
now and bring me a big one!

23:11.590 --> 23:14.332
You understand? Big?

23:16.328 --> 23:19.400
Oh, I just wish Clawd
were here with me.

23:19.498 --> 23:22.843
I know! I'm going to take some
more pictures to send him.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.249
What? They can't fix
your scooter?

23:28.374 --> 23:30.445
New one?

23:30.542 --> 23:31.714
How much?

23:31.844 --> 23:34.347
That much? What? I thought you
said a jillion wasn't a number.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.590
I'm sorry, love.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.270
Hey, Skelita,
what's that thing?

23:46.358 --> 23:48.702
This is my tribute
to my ancestors.

23:48.761 --> 23:53.039
All those that came before me.
To honor them gives me strength.

23:54.800 --> 23:59.545
Wow. Jim's new book
is really furrific.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.915
Hey Jin, I really
like your stuff.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.453
You are not to be
looking at this.

24:04.543 --> 24:06.420
Relax, I was just admiring it.

24:06.478 --> 24:08.287
This is a competition.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.451
Not supposed to be
helping competitors.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.460
Sorry.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.792
No need to get your
scales in a bunch.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.961
Did you see these
news pics she sent me?

24:17.056 --> 24:20.060
Check this guy! He's waiting
on her claw and hoof.

24:20.225 --> 24:24.469
Ahem, that's his job.
He's a waiter.

24:24.563 --> 24:29.512
Listen to me, hon, I think you
should take a deep breath, relax,

24:29.601 --> 24:31.308
and trust her, okay?

24:31.403 --> 24:34.475
So, you're saying I should
go to Scaris and find her!

24:34.573 --> 24:35.517
I'm on it.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.678
No! Clawd!

24:54.259 --> 24:56.364
Come on, you guys,

24:56.462 --> 24:58.601
can we go sit down somewhere?

24:58.697 --> 25:01.769
It's only been three blocks.
Don't be such a kitten!

25:10.342 --> 25:12.185
Well, what's! The owner say?

25:12.277 --> 25:14.553
Garrett used to come
here every morning.

25:14.646 --> 25:16.182
One day he told the owner

25:16.281 --> 25:18.352
that he would not be
coming in any longer.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.554
But why?

25:19.651 --> 25:21.528
Garrott did not say, exactly.

25:21.620 --> 25:25.727
Only that he was very excited
about a great opportunity.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.360
Opportunity?

25:27.459 --> 25:28.529
Vague much?

25:28.627 --> 25:30.573
The last place he knows of that

25:30.662 --> 25:32.539
anybody saw Garrett
was down by the river,

25:32.631 --> 25:34.304
making his drawings.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.337
<i>Mais</i> oui, my captive creator,

25:37.403 --> 25:39.576
your time has come, mon ami.

25:39.671 --> 25:43.346
These new ghouls are good,
as good as you were,

25:43.409 --> 25:45.650
before you lost it!

25:46.011 --> 25:49.049
And one of them will replace
you as my ghost designer.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.685
Consider yourself fired!

25:56.889 --> 25:59.597
Hey, man, thanks for coming.

25:59.691 --> 26:01.898
I... I know I'm being
a little dogged about this,

26:01.994 --> 26:03.735
but I just cant
stand the thought

26:03.829 --> 26:05.570
of Draculaura in
Scaris without me.

26:05.664 --> 26:08.577
No prob, that's what
best bros are for.

26:08.667 --> 26:11.546
Besides, I know Cleo's
probably dying without me.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.406
Thanks for coming, too, Heath.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.576
Even though I totally
told you not to. Whoa!

26:15.674 --> 26:18.086
You kiddin'? A chance
to miss some school?

26:18.177 --> 26:20.123
<i>I'm mere, bro-seems.</i>

26:24.516 --> 26:25.688
Uh-oh.

26:26.518 --> 26:29.431
In fashion,
styles come and they go.

26:29.521 --> 26:34.061
May I present to you the most
famous hunchback in all of Scaris,

26:34.126 --> 26:36.732
Modo! He is fashion's
King of Fools.

26:36.795 --> 26:40.208
Your assignment is to give my
friend here a fashion makeover.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.767
You are to sketch out an outfit

26:41.867 --> 26:43.437
that fits his
on-the-go lifestyle.

26:43.535 --> 26:44.946
It needs to be versatile.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.108
Something he can wear
to an ultra-posh feast,

26:47.206 --> 26:49.277
or just hanging
out ringing a bell.

26:49.374 --> 26:51.718
Your time begins now.

26:53.879 --> 26:55.881
Oh! That'll totally work!

26:55.948 --> 26:58.827
Little cross-stitching here,
some rushing there.

26:59.485 --> 27:00.725
Hey, Skelita,
what do you think?

27:00.786 --> 27:03.392
Hijole! How original!

27:03.455 --> 27:05.230
You think Madame will like it?

27:06.725 --> 27:08.762
Arréte, pencils down!

27:10.562 --> 27:14.169
What is this? You know you cannot
wear boots after Scar-bor Day!

27:14.266 --> 27:16.109
Well, yeah, but I thought...

27:16.168 --> 27:18.170
You thought? Impossible!

27:18.270 --> 27:21.012
Infantile, primitive!
All this talent,

27:21.106 --> 27:23.484
but you refuse to adhere
to the tenets of fashion!

27:23.575 --> 27:27.751
I am beginning to think
I was wrong about you.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.861
I thought I told you
to throw that away.

27:39.958 --> 27:44.270
Madame, I was just
looking for inspiration.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.275
I feel like I'm failing you.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.673
Oh, tsk, tsk.

27:47.766 --> 27:51.339
Ma <i>fille,</i> you are failing me.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.139
I brought you in
to study my style,

27:53.205 --> 27:54.479
not your own.

27:54.540 --> 27:57.885
When I saw your video, I was at
first, horrified by your designs.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.512
Um... Thanks?

27:59.611 --> 28:01.852
I thought, this girl
has something special

28:01.947 --> 28:03.221
inside of her that
you cannot teach.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.350
Really?

28:04.449 --> 28:06.360
I thought that I could
show you the right way,

28:06.451 --> 28:08.328
the Ghostier way,

28:08.387 --> 28:11.994
and maybe you would
become the next me.

28:12.057 --> 28:15.163
But you are determined
to do things the yuck way.

28:15.227 --> 28:18.902
Don't give up on me.
I can learn, I promise!

28:18.997 --> 28:21.876
First, you will stop
signing your work like that.

28:21.967 --> 28:25.141
And second, before you ever
touch your pencil to the paper,

28:25.204 --> 28:28.083
ask yourself,
"Would Madame wear this?"

28:28.173 --> 28:29.743
I won't let you down.

28:29.841 --> 28:31.912
Good. When you
turn in your book,

28:32.010 --> 28:35.048
I expect to see that you have
listened to what I have said.

29:05.043 --> 29:07.023
Oops, my bad.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.689
Oh, my Ra!

29:15.020 --> 29:16.021
Ugh!

29:19.091 --> 29:20.798
It's perfect.

29:24.730 --> 29:25.731
Ugh!

29:30.569 --> 29:32.879
Merci, mademoiselles.

29:33.538 --> 29:36.610
When you hear
the bell chime three times,

29:36.708 --> 29:39.279
you will know that
I have made my decision.

29:39.378 --> 29:44.225
And one of your dreams
will become fashion reality.

29:51.056 --> 29:53.900
Draculaura! I miss you, ghoul!

29:53.959 --> 29:57.805
Cleo! I miss someone
telling me what to do!

29:57.896 --> 30:00.570
I miss girls who
speak my language!

30:02.167 --> 30:03.168
Oh!

30:09.408 --> 30:11.081
I'm gonna ask that
dude if he's seen 'em.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.747
I don't think he's
gonna be much help.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.913
What does that mean?

30:15.080 --> 30:17.253
Where are they? Just tell me!

30:18.817 --> 30:20.694
They're over there? Let's go!

30:22.921 --> 30:25.094
You're just messing with
me now, aren't you?

30:28.527 --> 30:31.269
Oh, oh. What about the
Scare Lachaise cemetery?

30:31.330 --> 30:34.436
It is of no use, Frankie.
He has disappeared.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.877
We're gonna find him,
I just know it!

30:37.469 --> 30:39.176
Hmm. This café.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.114
We used to come
here all the time.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.653
He would sketch me,
and we'd watch

30:43.709 --> 30:45.882
the sun set over
the Eiffel Terror.

30:47.112 --> 30:48.614
If we were meant be,

30:48.680 --> 30:51.820
surely I would see
some kind of sign. No?

30:58.623 --> 30:59.624
<i>Regardez!</i>

30:59.691 --> 31:01.500
Look! The vines!

31:01.560 --> 31:04.131
They grow from
beneath the city!

31:04.196 --> 31:05.300
The catacombs!

31:08.700 --> 31:12.147
When this is over,
I'm gonna sleep like a mummy.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.205
Hey!

31:13.305 --> 31:14.511
Where did you get that?

31:14.573 --> 31:16.712
I found it in the trash.

31:16.808 --> 31:19.220
Someone must've thrown it away.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.381
I did.

31:20.479 --> 31:23.358
But, why?
Duh, they're terrible.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.726
The ghoul who did those
was young, immature and...

31:26.818 --> 31:30.595
Talented.
To see you now saddens me.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.895
No, I'm getting better!

31:31.990 --> 31:34.732
You saw Madame, she was over
the moon for my new work!

31:34.826 --> 31:38.399
Chica, that is because you were
doing it exactly like her.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.840
It wasn't you.

31:39.898 --> 31:43.243
She's an icon!
She has to be right.

31:43.335 --> 31:47.408
I'm just a nobody with a
chance to become somebody.

31:47.506 --> 31:48.780
Why do you design?

31:48.874 --> 31:51.582
Well, I'd die without it.

31:51.676 --> 31:54.589
It's how I express
who I really am.

31:54.679 --> 31:58.252
Who you really are'
or who Madame wants you to be?

32:00.018 --> 32:01.361
That means.“

32:01.420 --> 32:02.865
Madame has chosen.

32:03.522 --> 32:04.523
Here.

32:09.694 --> 32:10.798
Whoa, whoa.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.036
How far down do
you think it goes?

32:13.198 --> 32:17.374
Shh! These old bones
are trying to rest!

32:17.536 --> 32:19.038
Sorry!

32:19.738 --> 32:22.309
<i>Mademoiselles,</i> it <i>is time.</i>

32:23.041 --> 32:26.614
You three have been given the
biggest break of your lives,

32:26.711 --> 32:28.554
to learn from me!

32:28.613 --> 32:29.887
Look!

32:33.385 --> 32:36.298
And now,
one of you lucky ladies

32:36.388 --> 32:39.926
will be forever remembered
in the world of haunt couture

32:39.991 --> 32:43.461
as the next
Moanatella Ghostier!

32:47.065 --> 32:48.510
It goes
under the door!

32:48.733 --> 32:49.837
Allo?

32:49.935 --> 32:51.573
Oh! Rochelle!

32:51.636 --> 32:53.309
Garrett!

32:53.405 --> 32:55.851
For my apprentice,
I have chosen.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.086
Clawdeen Wolf!

32:59.911 --> 33:01.788
So, Madame Ghostier has had you

33:01.847 --> 33:03.986
locked away down
here the whole time?

33:04.082 --> 33:06.926
Oui. After I became
her apprentice,

33:06.985 --> 33:11.127
she lock me down here and force me
to design her clothes, her way,

33:11.189 --> 33:12.463
by her rules.

33:12.524 --> 33:13.525
But why?

33:13.625 --> 33:14.933
Why would somebody <i>as</i> big time

33:14.993 --> 33:16.836
as Madame Ghostier need you

33:16.928 --> 33:18.168
to design all her clothes?

33:18.263 --> 33:20.675
She has been doing this
a long, long time.

33:20.765 --> 33:23.211
Somewhere along
the way, she ran dry.

33:23.301 --> 33:25.338
I myself have run out of ideas.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.178
No, I do not believe it.

33:27.272 --> 33:29.843
I have no inspiration
down here.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.511
No Rochelle.

33:31.610 --> 33:34.523
Oh, Garrett,
I've missed you so!

33:35.347 --> 33:37.827
Um...  Hello!

33:37.883 --> 33:40.159
Not to interrupt
this beautiful moment,

33:40.218 --> 33:42.164
but, um, I've got a question,

33:42.220 --> 33:46.168
is Madame Ghostier replacing
you with her new apprentice?

33:46.224 --> 33:48.135
That is my understanding, out.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.302
Madame is coming.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.240
You must hide, quickly.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.472
Well, what are
we doin' down here?

33:57.569 --> 33:59.981
I'm going to show
you a secret, my dear.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.642
The biggest secret in fashion.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.209
Don't worry about me,
Madame Ghostier.

34:04.309 --> 34:06.653
I'm not going to tell anyone.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.315
I know.

34:08.380 --> 34:12.692
You're not ever going to tell
anyone, anything, ever again!

34:13.985 --> 34:15.692
Let me outta here!

34:15.754 --> 34:17.755
My new design book! Correction.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.927
My new clothing line!

34:20.025 --> 34:22.197
What? What's the deal?

34:24.195 --> 34:26.402
You're a brilliant
designer, Clawdeen.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.877
I'm going to use the designs
from your book as my new line.

34:31.835 --> 34:34.248
Now, if you'll excusez-moi,

34:34.339 --> 34:37.377
I have a triumphant fashion
show to prepare for.

34:38.342 --> 34:42.348
Alors, so, it would seem
you are my replacement.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.135
Man, we've been
all over this city.

34:57.228 --> 35:00.038
Those ghouls are,
like, nowhere.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.568
Yeah, I can't believe it.
I'm beginning to think...

35:07.706 --> 35:09.083
Guys, they're down here!

35:10.575 --> 35:11.781
I dunno, dude.

35:11.876 --> 35:15.119
Trust me, the nose knows, bros.

35:15.213 --> 35:17.386
Oh, my ghoul,
I had so much fun!

35:17.449 --> 35:20.487
I could sleep for five days.

35:20.585 --> 35:21.928
Yeah.

35:21.987 --> 35:25.264
I've never had so
much fun in my life!

35:25.323 --> 35:26.301
"Fun"?

35:26.391 --> 35:29.235
Maybe she think that word
mean something else.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.900
You've been a real berk
the whole trip, Toralei.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.443
I know. That's fun to me.

35:34.499 --> 35:37.002
See? I told you.
She has to ruin everything.

35:37.102 --> 35:40.106
Look, you guys could've
ditched me, and you didn't.

35:40.171 --> 35:42.845
So, thanks or whatever.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.614
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

35:44.676 --> 35:47.987
You're saying we're trapped
down here, like, forever-ever?

35:48.079 --> 35:49.752
There's got to be a way out.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.589
I'm afraid no.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.857
The walls, they are too thick,

35:53.952 --> 35:57.490
and this part of the
catacombs, too forbidden.

35:57.589 --> 36:01.935
Oui, no one would ever be
fool enough to come near here.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.604
Whoa! It sure is
dark down here.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.507
Are you sure we're in the
right place, brochacho'?

36:07.599 --> 36:09.806
Look, I've lived with
Clawdeen my whole life,

36:09.868 --> 36:12.041
I know her scent anywhere.
Trust me.

36:12.137 --> 36:13.673
The nose knows. The nose knows.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.547
The worst part of this is

36:15.640 --> 36:19.850
I changed who I was as a designer
just to please somebody else.

36:19.944 --> 36:21.685
It is not your fault.

36:21.780 --> 36:25.853
It is monster nature to want to
please those you look up to...

36:25.950 --> 36:26.951
My brother!

36:27.018 --> 36:28.691
Clawd, we're over here!

36:29.621 --> 36:31.066
Clawdeen!

36:31.322 --> 36:32.824
Bone-Jour.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.199
What are you doing down here?

36:34.292 --> 36:37.205
There's no time for all of that.
Get us out of here!

36:46.571 --> 36:48.209
Up top?

36:48.506 --> 36:50.008
Oh! Rochelle!

36:50.075 --> 36:51.816
We gotta hurry if
we want to get there

36:51.876 --> 36:53.549
before Madame Ghostiers
fashion show!

36:53.645 --> 36:55.886
We must expose her
for the fraud she is!

36:55.980 --> 36:57.254
No.

36:57.348 --> 36:59.157
Exposing her is not enough.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.924
You want to beat
Madame at her own game.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.054
That's right!

37:02.153 --> 37:05.930
I wanna beat her
my way with my style!

37:06.024 --> 37:08.231
Frankie, call the ghouls!

37:08.760 --> 37:12.105
All right, Madame Ghostier and her
crew are gonna be across town

37:12.197 --> 37:13.904
setting up for
the fashion show,

37:13.998 --> 37:16.569
so we can use
the design center here.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.739
Okay, what do you need?

37:18.837 --> 37:21.181
Clawd'? What are
you doing here?

37:21.239 --> 37:22.843
Well, I...

37:22.941 --> 37:24.079
Okay, fine.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.121
I just couldn't
stand the thought of you

37:26.211 --> 37:28.248
being in the most
romantic city in the world

37:28.346 --> 37:29.381
without me.

37:29.748 --> 37:33.093
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.

37:33.184 --> 37:35.630
And I see you came along, too.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.930
Yeah. I gotta support
my dawg, bro-code and all. Yeah.

37:40.024 --> 37:43.938
So, it wasn't because
you missed me at all?

37:44.028 --> 37:45.098
Are you kidding?

37:45.196 --> 37:48.302
Okay! My life doesn't make
any sense without you.

37:48.466 --> 37:51.037
Don't leave for
this long ever again!

37:51.636 --> 37:54.242
Okay, Deucey,
I won't. Oh.“

37:54.439 --> 37:57.750
Um... Anybody miss me?

37:58.076 --> 38:01.455
Hmm... I missed him.
Little bit.

38:04.048 --> 38:05.083
Gotcha.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.151
Do not push it.

38:06.918 --> 38:10.229
Then what are you waiting for?
Let us do this fang.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.165
Even with two designers,

38:12.257 --> 38:14.828
I don't think there's
gonna be enough time.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.428
What about four?

38:16.494 --> 38:20.601
We sensed something did not feel right
about Sefiora Ghostier, so we stayed.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.474
And we overheard your plan.

38:22.567 --> 38:23.773
You're going to need this.

38:25.069 --> 38:28.778
I would be honored to help
such an original designer.

38:28.840 --> 38:33.152
I can't think of three monsters
I'd rather put a show on with,

38:33.244 --> 38:36.123
including
Moanatella Ghostier herself!

38:50.995 --> 38:51.996
Ah!

39:03.041 --> 39:06.989
Oh, my ghoul! Only 20
minutes till the show!

39:07.045 --> 39:10.458
Oh, we're not gonna make it.
She still has so much to do.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.550
<i>We'll make it.</i>

39:11.649 --> 39:12.855
How can you be so sure?

39:12.951 --> 39:14.453
'Cause I know
something you don't

39:37.475 --> 39:40.752
I love the classics. And
speaking of the classics...

39:48.186 --> 39:49.187
Ah!

40:01.165 --> 40:03.668
Welcome, everyone, to the debut

40:03.735 --> 40:06.272
of my latest,
greatest clothing line!

40:20.018 --> 40:22.225
Huh! What is the meaning
of this?

40:33.064 --> 40:35.635
Brilliant! Magnifique!

40:36.301 --> 40:38.781
This fashion line is fantastic!

40:39.537 --> 40:42.916
This is an outrage!
Stop! Stop at once!

40:42.974 --> 40:45.648
These are not my designs!

40:45.944 --> 40:47.821
Incroyable!

40:49.547 --> 40:50.628
Stunning.

41:02.060 --> 41:05.166
A kitty can't just
change her stripes.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.839
I cannot be ignored!

41:13.638 --> 41:15.413
No! No! No!

41:17.075 --> 41:18.247
I must do something!

41:27.151 --> 41:28.425
Amazing!

41:29.487 --> 41:32.434
Scaris is lovin'
them some Heath.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.662
Whoa!

41:33.758 --> 41:35.669
Ah...

41:38.463 --> 41:40.374
Ahead of its time!

41:40.932 --> 41:42.809
You cannot be serious!

41:42.867 --> 41:46.110
This collection, it breaks
every known rule of fashion.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.171
It is heresy!

41:47.271 --> 41:48.306
Madame Ghostier?

41:48.373 --> 41:49.943
<i>Madame'? Oui?</i>

41:50.008 --> 41:52.955
Will you move out of the way?
You're blocking our view!

41:53.044 --> 41:54.546
No!

41:54.645 --> 41:56.955
Clawdeen, you nailed it.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.326
Come on, let's go show the
world who did this fang!

42:09.994 --> 42:12.702
I'm so very glad that
you like my protégé!

42:12.797 --> 42:14.367
You can direct all
of your questions,

42:14.465 --> 42:17.674
comments, and compliments
to me, out?

42:17.735 --> 42:20.215
So, who's first, hmm?

42:23.408 --> 42:24.608
Clawdeen... Madame Wolf...

42:24.642 --> 42:26.212
Madame Wolf,
how does it feel to be

42:26.310 --> 42:28.586
the new, singular
voice of fashion?

42:28.679 --> 42:30.249
Now you make the rules!

42:30.348 --> 42:33.261
I used to sit and wait
for Madame Ghostier

42:33.351 --> 42:35.592
to tell me what
I could wear, and when.

42:35.686 --> 42:38.895
Now I realize fashion
is about expression.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.901
No, I can't be ignored.

42:42.060 --> 42:45.371
These monsters behind me
gave me the confidence.

42:45.430 --> 42:48.570
There's room for more
than just one voice.

42:48.699 --> 42:51.179
And with
Moanatella Ghostier gone,

42:51.235 --> 42:55.183
the world of fashion
just got a lot bigger.

42:56.607 --> 42:59.781
At Monster High,
it's about who you are.

43:01.012 --> 43:03.515
This Monster High sounds cool!

43:03.581 --> 43:06.187
Yes. Do they take
exchange students?

43:07.618 --> 43:10.531
Garrott, I feel the same way
about Monster High.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.761
You promise to write?

43:12.857 --> 43:14.768
Every day, ma chérie.

43:15.793 --> 43:17.568
Come on ghouls, let's show them

43:17.628 --> 43:21.075
how we do fashion
at Monster High!

43:33.711 --> 43:36.658
Clawdeen, that was
a beautiful speech.

43:38.549 --> 43:41.792
Hey-hey! All right! Finally!

43:55.066 --> 43:56.511
<i>Hey, where are you going'?</i>

43:56.601 --> 43:58.410
<i>Don't you wanna see
how we got home?</i>

44:04.509 --> 44:07.490
<i>Scaris was a monster blast!</i>

44:07.578 --> 44:11.617
<i>And like all good things, our
trip had to come to an end.</i>

44:11.682 --> 44:14.993
<i>Our flight from Charles de Ghoul
Scareport didn't leave until later,</i>

44:15.086 --> 44:17.657
<i>so we had plenty of time.</i>

44:23.294 --> 44:26.002
I just love this city.

44:26.097 --> 44:29.772
Yeah, it's the most exotic and
amazing city I've ever seen.

44:29.934 --> 44:31.777
Of course, I'm so new,

44:31.836 --> 44:34.316
I haven't been
very many places.

44:34.372 --> 44:35.476
Nor I.

44:35.540 --> 44:38.020
Always so focused on
studies and fashion,

44:38.109 --> 44:40.487
I never took the time to see...
Whoa!

44:40.545 --> 44:41.615
What is out there.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.989
Yeah' it's a shame
we have to go back so soon.

44:44.048 --> 44:45.889
There's still so much to see!

44:45.950 --> 44:47.020
No, no, no, no.

44:47.118 --> 44:50.691
No more sightseeing.
We have a plane to catch.

44:50.788 --> 44:54.361
You're a good
hooky-wonky, aren't you?

44:54.458 --> 44:56.028
Yes, you are.

44:56.127 --> 44:57.834
Now you go into this bag...

44:59.063 --> 45:02.476
Look I will take you out again
when we're in the air, okay?

45:02.533 --> 45:05.070
I don't want any more
tricks outta you now.

45:05.203 --> 45:09.208
Uh, your design book
sure has a lot of, uh.-.

45:09.473 --> 45:10.543
Personality.

45:10.641 --> 45:11.676
Tell me about it.

45:11.742 --> 45:14.222
It seems like the more drawings
that I filled it with,

45:14.312 --> 45:18.158
the more it came lo life,
like, literally.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.890
It doesn't seem
to want to obey you.

45:23.421 --> 45:25.162
Well, that's creativity
for you.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.396
It's got a mind of its own.

45:27.491 --> 45:29.994
Oh, hey, I love your bag!

45:30.061 --> 45:31.665
Great taste, luggage twin.

45:31.829 --> 45:34.002
You too.

45:35.833 --> 45:38.541
I'm really gonna miss
shopping here in Scaris.

45:38.603 --> 45:42.346
Speaking of which, Cleo and
Draculaura shoulda been back by now.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.579
Yeah, where are they?

45:46.010 --> 45:47.421
Scaris!
That's so fabulous!

45:47.511 --> 45:48.512
Shopping!

45:48.579 --> 45:50.525
<i>You'd be batty if
you thought those two ghouls</i>

45:50.581 --> 45:54.188
<i>were gonna leave the fashion
capital of the world empty handed.</i>

45:54.518 --> 45:56.691
Oh, right. Of course.

45:57.455 --> 46:00.299
Okay, Cleo and Draculaura
will meet us at the Scareport.

46:04.195 --> 46:07.233
Yeah, Ghoulia's right, mates.
We better get a move on.

46:08.866 --> 46:10.311
Everyone hurry,
s'il vous plait!

46:16.107 --> 46:19.953
I don't understand, how do they
get all this stuff in here?

46:20.044 --> 46:21.887
Girl magic, bro.

46:24.048 --> 46:26.494
Bad news, guys.
They overbooked the plane.

46:28.286 --> 46:29.765
We gotta take separate flights.

46:29.887 --> 46:31.767
I can't believe it!
I wanted to sit next to you.

46:32.757 --> 46:34.065
Clawd!

46:34.158 --> 46:36.297
Only one bag? I'm impressed.

46:36.761 --> 46:38.763
You've shown a lot of restraint.

46:49.907 --> 46:51.079
Whoa!

46:54.912 --> 46:58.325
Abbey, Cleo, Deuce,
Heath, Jin, Skelita, Ghoulia,

46:58.416 --> 47:00.919
our plane is over here! Bye!

47:01.786 --> 47:03.766
See you back
in Monster High!

47:10.961 --> 47:12.941
Hey, Draculaura!

47:12.997 --> 47:15.170
What? I can't hear...

47:15.266 --> 47:18.110
Clawdeen's design book'? Uh-oh.

47:18.436 --> 47:20.609
Wait, wait, fang on,
I can't hear anything.

47:20.705 --> 47:22.343
Here, hold this for a sec.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.181
Let me talk to her.

47:24.275 --> 47:26.152
Frankie' we're
about to take off.

47:26.210 --> 47:30.022
Just make sure you keep
an eye on my book, 'kay?

47:30.114 --> 47:31.286
Don't worry about a thing.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.196
on, man,

47:36.287 --> 47:40.235
I can't be seen carrying
this girly bag around.

47:42.960 --> 47:43.961
Hmm?

47:44.628 --> 47:45.834
Hmm!

47:51.135 --> 47:54.548
<i>I'm serious, that
beck has a mind of its own!</i>

47:54.638 --> 47:58.643
Seriously, I've got this,
Clawdeen, Monster's honor.

47:58.709 --> 48:01.053
I won't take my eyes off of...

48:01.479 --> 48:02.549
<i>Hankie!</i>

48:02.646 --> 48:04.057
Uh, I'll call you back.

48:04.148 --> 48:06.651
Don't worry about the book,
everything's cool.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.094
Bye!

48:08.319 --> 48:10.560
Heath, where's the bag?

48:10.654 --> 48:13.533
Relax. I set it down behind.“

48:13.691 --> 48:15.364
Oh, no.

48:15.493 --> 48:16.870
Whoo-hoo!

48:16.927 --> 48:17.928
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

48:21.732 --> 48:25.339
We have to get to that plane!
My friend's book is on there.

48:28.172 --> 48:30.413
You guys go ahead
and catch the flight home.

48:30.508 --> 48:33.079
But I'm not going back
without that design book.

48:33.177 --> 48:34.247
We have got your back!

48:34.345 --> 48:35.415
I'm all fired up.

48:35.513 --> 48:37.754
Sir, can you tell me
where that plane is headed?

48:38.783 --> 48:40.194
Fangladesh.

48:40.718 --> 48:43.597
I guess we're
going to Fangladesh!

48:50.361 --> 48:52.534
<i>Ghoulia figured out
a way to track the bag</i>

48:52.596 --> 48:54.701
<i>using the Creep-PS
in Clawdeen's phone.</i>

48:54.865 --> 48:57.243
<i>Something about reverse triangulation.</i>

49:00.037 --> 49:03.883
<i>Mira! Look at this place!
Es may fantastical.</i>

49:05.075 --> 49:07.419
Are you serious?

49:07.478 --> 49:13.724
Do you have any idea what this
humidity will do to my beautiful hair?

49:13.818 --> 49:17.129
Hey, Deuce, is it just me

49:17.221 --> 49:20.464
or is Jin totally
into the Heathster?

49:20.558 --> 49:22.094
It's just you.

49:22.159 --> 49:24.833
Read you loud and clear.
I'm going in.

49:24.929 --> 49:25.964
Dude.

49:26.063 --> 49:28.134
Hey Jin, miss me?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.001
Ooh!

49:32.770 --> 49:35.307
It's in
the unclaimed baggage!

49:36.740 --> 49:37.946
Guys, this way!

49:38.976 --> 49:39.977
Hmm?

49:40.110 --> 49:41.111
Hmm...

49:45.616 --> 49:48.028
Earthquake! No, worse.

49:51.088 --> 49:52.260
Stampede!

49:56.760 --> 49:57.761
Don't worry, Jin!

50:01.098 --> 50:02.168
Oh, no!

50:03.133 --> 50:04.544
You're welcome.

50:05.703 --> 50:06.704
Aw!

50:12.877 --> 50:14.049
We gotta be close.

50:14.144 --> 50:15.384
Right?

50:18.282 --> 50:19.283
There!

50:20.951 --> 50:22.555
Must be very quiet.

50:22.653 --> 50:26.567
If anything like yaks,
very grumpy when wake up.

50:26.724 --> 50:27.828
I know!

50:32.997 --> 50:34.037
Hey' hey' hey!

50:34.865 --> 50:35.866
Gotcha!

50:35.966 --> 50:37.968
We're not losing you again.

50:39.470 --> 50:42.474
Now, we just head
back to the Scareport

50:42.540 --> 50:45.487
and we'll be home in two
shakes of a griffin's tail.

50:49.914 --> 50:50.915
The bag!

50:51.015 --> 50:52.517
There might be
a way to follow it,

50:52.583 --> 50:55.530
but we're going to
need your credit card.

50:55.586 --> 50:57.224
Fine. Which one?

51:14.104 --> 51:16.414
We're not going fast enough,
we're losing the signal!

51:16.507 --> 51:18.180
Allow me.

51:20.010 --> 51:23.184
Whoa! That's cool.
And by cool, I mean hot.

51:23.681 --> 51:27.788
You know, I'm no stranger
to the "flame game" myself.

51:27.885 --> 51:29.193
Dude, careful!

51:29.253 --> 51:31.927
This is the Heath-miester
you're talking to.

51:32.022 --> 51:34.696
Name one time I wasn't careful.

51:35.359 --> 51:36.360
Called it.

51:36.460 --> 51:37.461
Heath!

51:38.295 --> 51:40.901
Huh! Okay, that's one.

51:41.265 --> 51:43.074
Deuce, do something!

51:47.538 --> 51:48.539
Oh!

51:49.373 --> 51:51.319
Whoa! No.

51:51.408 --> 51:54.048
I am totally doing that again!

51:56.714 --> 51:58.716
Uh, guys...

51:59.416 --> 52:00.417
Dude...

52:06.390 --> 52:08.563
<i>Cleo texted and
said she'd see us soon.</i>

52:08.626 --> 52:11.402
<i>Bu! We had our own problems
to worry about.</i>

52:11.929 --> 52:12.930
 Whoa!

52:14.832 --> 52:16.175
Why have we stopped?

52:16.266 --> 52:18.906
Hey, I know this place!

52:22.606 --> 52:23.914
Es no bueno.

52:27.311 --> 52:29.018
According to this amulet,

52:29.113 --> 52:33.323
if I rub it three times, it will
transport us to their location.

52:36.787 --> 52:37.822
Oh.

52:37.921 --> 52:39.958
"Do not rub it three times"

52:40.024 --> 52:42.095
I've got to brush up
on my hieroglyphics.

52:47.531 --> 52:48.771
The signal is close.

52:48.832 --> 52:51.142
The book's gotta be
around here somewhere!

52:58.442 --> 53:02.686
At this altitude, I do not have
enough breath to make fire.

53:02.780 --> 53:04.123
My lady...

53:09.286 --> 53:12.028
Cousin Blitnichcik! Aw.

53:16.794 --> 53:18.569
Inside joke.

53:23.233 --> 53:26.544
Why does this place
look so familiar?

53:26.637 --> 53:28.583
I don't know. Hmm.

53:28.672 --> 53:30.015
But we should
probably make a fire

53:30.074 --> 53:31.985
so planes know that
we're stranded down here.

53:39.249 --> 53:41.160
Now I remember.

53:43.387 --> 53:44.730
<i>Abbey's cousin
was nice enough</i>

53:44.822 --> 53:46.563
<i>10 lead us to Clawdeen's book.</i>

53:48.258 --> 53:49.259
Whoa!

53:56.433 --> 53:57.503
It is in that nest!

53:59.570 --> 54:01.846
Finally! You're not
going anywhere.

54:02.372 --> 54:03.407
Hmm!

54:03.507 --> 54:04.679
Come back!

54:06.677 --> 54:07.678
Oh, man!

54:07.845 --> 54:09.188
Whoo-hoo!

54:11.548 --> 54:13.550
Not again!

54:21.225 --> 54:25.196
<i>We followed that book
everywhere, like, literally.</i>

54:25.262 --> 54:26.707
<i>From Haunt-Kong”.</i>

54:31.702 --> 54:32.874
This way!

54:36.206 --> 54:38.152
<i>To the Scare-ham desert.</i>

54:45.949 --> 54:47.656
<i>Transylvania.</i>

54:56.627 --> 54:57.970
<i>Doombai.</i>

54:58.929 --> 55:01.432
<i>But it seemed ma!
No matter what we did,</i>

55:02.599 --> 55:05.842
<i>the book was always
one step ahead of us.</i>

55:11.308 --> 55:14.983
Okay. All we have to do is row
to that ship and get the book.

55:15.779 --> 55:17.417
Uh, Frankie, what ship?

55:19.750 --> 55:21.696
Where'd the ship go?

55:24.688 --> 55:26.326
That doesn't make any sense.

55:26.423 --> 55:28.130
According to your dooamahickey,

55:28.192 --> 55:29.830
we should be
right on top of it.

55:40.504 --> 55:42.177
Oh, oh! I've got it!

55:42.272 --> 55:45.685
I know how to get the Tiki
to help us get out of here!

55:45.776 --> 55:47.687
An apology could go along way.

55:47.778 --> 55:50.452
Yeah, we're not getting off
this island without their help.

55:53.283 --> 55:55.786
Apologies aren't
really my thing.

55:55.853 --> 55:58.697
For favor,
no more Egyptian magic.

55:58.789 --> 56:00.530
<i>Cleo had
something better.</i>

56:00.624 --> 56:03.366
I'm going to do
what I do when Nefera

56:03.460 --> 56:06.066
and my father won't
let me go somewhere.

56:06.163 --> 56:08.905
Right! Pretend like
you don't want to go!

56:08.999 --> 56:10.672
Precisely.

56:10.734 --> 56:12.145
<i>Teenage magic!</i>

56:12.469 --> 56:14.415
<i>So Cleo went to
the Tiki and made them</i>

56:14.504 --> 56:17.542
<i>an offer that they,
um, could refuse.</i>

56:17.641 --> 56:21.088
Oh, you were so right
not to help us

56:21.178 --> 56:24.682
get off this amazing island.

56:24.748 --> 56:27.354
I never want to leave!

56:27.417 --> 56:30.557
We need to brighten
this place up.

56:30.654 --> 56:32.224
Get rid of all the plants.

56:32.322 --> 56:34.029
Slap a coat of paint on here,

56:34.091 --> 56:35.536
Princess Nile Blue
would be perfection.

56:35.592 --> 56:37.003
A walk-in closet here.“

56:41.498 --> 56:44.672
Oh! Thank you. Thank you.

56:44.868 --> 56:46.779
How's that for magic?

56:59.383 --> 57:02.455
Really? Only a couple of miles
away from Monster High? Hmm'?

57:02.552 --> 57:03.587
Whoo-hoo!

57:03.687 --> 57:06.031
Wait, what we so
excitement about?

57:06.089 --> 57:08.763
We still stuck in
tummy of Sea Monster.

57:08.859 --> 57:12.397
We're gonna be inside
this stupid thing forever.

57:12.462 --> 57:14.942
I can't believe all
the bad luck we've had.

57:15.032 --> 57:18.070
It's almost as if her book
didn't want to be found.

57:18.135 --> 57:21.412
That's it! The book
did not want to be found.

57:21.471 --> 57:23.382
It wanted us to chase it.

57:23.473 --> 57:24.975
- What?
- That crazy talk.

57:25.075 --> 57:28.284
Think of all the
places we went looking for it.

57:28.378 --> 57:30.619
Places we never
would go otherwise.

57:30.714 --> 57:33.820
Now, it has led us
to Monster High.

57:34.618 --> 57:35.961
<i>Jin was right.</i>

57:36.053 --> 57:38.397
<i>It created this
amazing adventure,</i>

57:38.455 --> 57:40.662
<i>sending us to the four comers o!
The world.</i>

57:40.757 --> 57:43.636
<i>We experienced things
and saw stuff that</i>

57:43.727 --> 57:46.469
<i>knocked {he bolts off
our wildest dreams!</i>

57:46.563 --> 57:49.237
<i>The book always knew
where it was going.</i>

57:49.299 --> 57:52.246
<i>But it took
the long way home for us.</i>

57:53.236 --> 57:56.149
But none of it means anything
if we can't get out of here.

57:56.239 --> 57:57.274
Hmm?

57:57.341 --> 57:58.342
Hmm...

58:01.144 --> 58:02.145
Hmm...

58:05.916 --> 58:06.917
ALL; Whoa!

58:09.019 --> 58:11.192
The Sea Monster
is ticklish!

58:11.288 --> 58:13.928
Quick! Everybody
start tickling the walls!

58:13.991 --> 58:16.471
Maybe we can get
him to spit us out!

58:25.502 --> 58:26.503
Our balloon!

58:31.341 --> 58:33.514
Hmm, that was convenient.

58:33.610 --> 58:34.645
Oh, no!

58:34.711 --> 58:35.712
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

58:40.117 --> 58:43.690
Hmm, nice job, Heath.
I am impressed.

58:43.787 --> 58:46.893
Hey' it's what I do.

58:48.625 --> 58:49.797
Heath!

58:59.169 --> 59:01.911
Hey, what happened to you guys?

59:02.072 --> 59:04.848
Long story. You guys?

59:04.908 --> 59:07.184
Longer one.

59:07.244 --> 59:10.521
Frankie, I been
calling you, what...

59:10.580 --> 59:11.558
My book!

59:11.648 --> 59:13.389
Were you a good boy?

59:13.483 --> 59:16.327
You didn't cause any trouble
for Frankie, did you?

59:16.386 --> 59:17.694
No, you didn't!

59:17.754 --> 59:19.495
Oh!

59:19.923 --> 59:22.563
Thanks, Frankie! I would've
torn my fur out...

59:22.659 --> 59:25.833
from being away from
my design book for so long.

59:25.929 --> 59:27.067
<i>Clawdeen was right.</i>

59:27.164 --> 59:31.078
<i>The book gave her the confidence
to take on Madame Ghostier!</i>

59:31.168 --> 59:35.708
<i>It proved that imagination and
creativity can take you anywhere.</i>

59:35.772 --> 59:38.582
The logarithmic
amplitude of the co-efficient

59:38.675 --> 59:41.417
can easily be
calculated by using

59:41.511 --> 59:42.751
- blah over blah...
- Hey, Frankie,

59:42.846 --> 59:45.759
forgot to ask, what took
you so long to get home'?

59:45.849 --> 59:47.522
I hope my book
wasn't any trouble.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.585
Hmm?

59:49.286 --> 59:52.199
Nah.
Missed our flight.
