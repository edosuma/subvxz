How many has that been?

- Because it would give us
a little extra peace of mind.

wouldn't hurt.

the best idea though?

they've had a rough past

09:10.717 --> 09:12.217

09:17.724 --> 09:19.591
- (laughs) I know,
but the ironic part

09:19.660 --> 09:21.593
Is that it's paula
and all her well-off friends

09:21.728 --> 09:23.527
That cooper really wants
at the gala.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.130
- Oh my gosh, I completely
forgot about that.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.931
I still haven't booked
a babysitter.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.367
- We don't need one.
I've got it covered, remember?

09:29.436 --> 09:32.436
- Uh, I don't think that's
a good idea, not right now.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.739
Not with all that's going on.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.874
I'll... I'll stay home
with the kids.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.344
- No, but grandpa, cooper needs
all the support he can get.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.947
- Well, exactly. That way...
All three of you can go.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.316
- Well, I'm not going
if you're not going.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.386
But I guess we'll stay home
and send a big donation.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.188
- What if it's true?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.891
What if these kids are the ones
breaking into all the houses?

09:52.893 --> 09:55.760
- No, I... I don't think
they are.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.630
- Then who was it, mommy?
- I don't know, honey,

09:58.699 --> 10:01.166
But the police are gonna
catch them, okay?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.701
- What if they come here?

10:02.703 --> 10:06.237
- No one is coming here.
We're safe.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.972
- And we're putting in
a security system,

10:08.008 --> 10:10.441
For extra protection.
- What's that?

10:10.477 --> 10:13.244
- It monitors your home
and sets off an alarm

10:13.313 --> 10:15.513
In case anyone ever breaks in.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.049
- I thought you said no one
was coming here.

10:18.184 --> 10:21.252
- They're not, but...
Just a precaution.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.987
(utensils clink and scrape)

10:26.159 --> 10:27.825
(a horse whinnies
in the distance)

10:31.064 --> 10:32.864
- Hey! You heading
to the centre?

10:32.933 --> 10:34.799
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be
spending a lot of time there

10:34.868 --> 10:36.635
Until cooper finds
a new trainer.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.737
- Well, I hope he appreciates
you stepping in like this.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.206
- He does, lou. He's actually
a very generous client.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.874
- Great! So, um...

10:42.876 --> 10:45.243
These kids...
What are they like?

10:45.378 --> 10:47.078
- You're not actually
considering

10:47.080 --> 10:48.647
What paula westfield said,
are you?

10:48.782 --> 10:51.015
- No, no. Not really, but...
- Lou.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.985
- These break-ins have
come out of nowhere.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.287
- So what?
- So how can we be sure

10:56.289 --> 10:58.522
They don't have anything
to do with it?

10:58.558 --> 10:59.724
- (sighs heavily)

11:00.827 --> 11:02.761
You know, when I look
at these kids,

11:02.763 --> 11:05.496
I see ty at their age -
dealt a tough hand,

11:05.532 --> 11:07.232
And then constantly
judged for it.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.033
And then the second
anything goes wrong,

11:09.102 --> 11:10.968
Everybody turns
their eyes on them,

11:11.038 --> 11:12.837
And that's not fair.
- I get that.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.740
But maybe you're being
a little too biased here, amy.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.343
I mean, not every one
of these kids is like ty,

11:18.478 --> 11:20.578
And you don't really even
know them that well.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.313
Whoever is responsible
for these break-ins

11:22.382 --> 11:24.716
Is putting families at risk.
Including ours.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.585
I mean, you've seen how worried
lyndy and katie are.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.186
- Yeah. I know, and so am I.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.456
But that doesn't mean we should
go pointing fingers at people

11:31.458 --> 11:33.391
Until we actually
have a reason to.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.527
- I'm sorry, but I need to get
to the bottom of this.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.064
- Then come with me.
- Well, I told paula I would

11:40.133 --> 11:43.534
And, well, my morning
is pretty free.

- Yeah.

- See ya.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.648

of a visit from our mayor?

12:30.650 --> 12:32.616
- Well...
- Wouldn't have anything to do

12:32.652 --> 12:35.186
With those burglaries,
now, would it?

12:35.188 --> 12:38.189
- Yeah. That's the real
reason I'm here.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.925
We got a few calls saying your
kids might've been involved.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.862
- Yeah, me too.
- These kids never get a break.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.963
- Look, I'm not saying
I believe it, okay?

12:45.965 --> 12:48.399
In fact, I came out here
to put the accusations to rest.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.267
- Well, thank you.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.005
- So when did this most recent
group of kids arrive?

12:54.074 --> 12:56.440
- It's about a week ago.
- Timing's not great.

12:56.510 --> 12:59.744
- No. Pretty much lines up
exactly with the burglaries.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.546
- Trust me, all right,
it wasn't them.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.948
They work with the horses,
and it's chores all day.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.017
Then we have dinner
and it's early curfew.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.086
- Well, is there any way
they could sneak off-site?

13:08.088 --> 13:10.221
- No. No, I would notice that.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.156
And plus, that's just...

13:12.159 --> 13:14.425

and window sensors.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.309
- That's a motion detector.
- Yeah.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.112

doesn't it?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.114
It's gonna be like fort knox
around here.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.849

second thoughts

13:37.918 --> 13:39.450
On putting all this up?
- No, no--

13:39.452 --> 13:40.985
- I can still call
and have it installed, honey.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.854
- I can do it, it just...

13:42.989 --> 13:44.923
It's a lot of equipment
and all.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.692

he just seems like it.

swagger to him or something.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.163

What was he like yesterday?

after mac.

ran right in there.

How did you know he wasn't
gonna turn on you?

14:37.010 --> 14:39.410

I just kinda reacted.

sense with horses,

worked up, like this one was.

Besides, we said we'd look
after the kids.

28:35.881 --> 28:39.483
- I know. So, what I'm thinking
is that we take them with us,

28:39.618 --> 28:41.684
Because the family
has been on edge lately

28:41.721 --> 28:43.353

28:43.355 --> 28:44.955

together.

in that suit I bought you.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.098

28:55.101 --> 28:57.300
I'll get handsome for you.

you so much?

I think not.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.926
And after doing some digging,

38:16.995 --> 38:18.995
You probably won't be surprised
to learn

38:18.997 --> 38:21.331
That we found several of them

38:21.400 --> 38:23.533
Already have criminal records.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.803
- Uh, ma'am, if I could just--
- no, no, no.

38:27.839 --> 38:31.174
Don't "ma'am" me,
and don't silence me.

38:31.176 --> 38:33.877

<i> of these burglaries.</i>

38:33.879 --> 38:36.546
Not only will we not support
your centre,

38:36.681 --> 38:39.815
But we will continue
to push our mayor,

38:39.851 --> 38:43.019
Lou fleming,
to do the right thing

38:44.756 --> 38:47.123
And shut you down.
- Okay, all right.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.894
That's enough.
You've had your say.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.330
- (chuckles) yes, I have.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.716
How am I gonna get any
sponsorship money now?

39:13.785 --> 39:15.785
- Oh, c'mon, cooper,
it's just one night.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.187
- You don't get it, clint.
Everything was riding on this.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.924

from one of the tables.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.266
- (laughs) wow.
Great job, mac.

39:41.113 --> 39:43.312
Got anything to do with them?

39:43.348 --> 39:45.915
- Dude. Have you lost
your mind?

39:45.917 --> 39:48.083
I sleep in the bunk
right above you.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.085
Think I'm sneaking out
the window?

39:49.154 --> 39:51.154
- I don't trust you.

39:51.223 --> 39:53.156
- Oh, so that's what
it's about, hey?

39:53.291 --> 39:55.825
Your soft spot for locked up
animals...

40:07.338 --> 40:08.771

with you two?

40:08.774 --> 40:10.373
- He sucker punched me
right out of the blue.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.208
- He's been torturing
challenge.

40:13.278 --> 40:15.244
Putting him in a stall

40:15.280 --> 40:17.780
And throwing firecrackers
at him to scare him.

40:17.849 --> 40:21.050
- Mac! No wonder the horse
went after you.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.554
- I should've let him get you.
- Hey, hey.

upsetting, cooper.

- Ms. Fitzroy.
- I'm going to have to

40:37.302 --> 40:39.735
Reconsider my contributions
going forward.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.770
- (sighs heavily)

40:49.147 --> 40:51.814

a complete disaster.

40:51.850 --> 40:54.484

40:54.553 --> 40:56.219
Oh, no, we don't know that yet.

40:56.288 --> 40:57.720
- C'mon, clint.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.689
That scuffle was the final nail
in our coffin.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.691
Those kids ruined it
for all of us.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.827
- Cooper,
I know you're upset, but...

41:04.863 --> 41:06.963
I hope you're not blaming
logan.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.966
- He started the fight, amy.
- You heard him.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.568
You know what mac did
with challenge.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.570
He better be suspended
from the centre.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.971
- What centre?
There's no way I can dig us

41:16.007 --> 41:17.507
Out of this hole now.
- Hey, look,

41:17.642 --> 41:20.776
Things might look bleak, but...
You can still save this.

41:20.778 --> 41:22.645
I can help you put a plan
in place.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.117
- (sighs) let's talk later.

41:29.354 --> 41:32.255
You know, tonight,
I just need to lick my wounds.

the camera,

42:13.765 --> 42:15.565
You turned off the entire
system, that's why.

Thank you.
