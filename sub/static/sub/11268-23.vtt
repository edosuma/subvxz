00:04.204 --> 00:05.738
                Hey, Cliffie.   
                      Hey, Norm.

00:05.805 --> 00:07.339
                 How's your day?
                     Oh, boring.

00:07.407 --> 00:08.807
              Nothing happens in
              this burg anymore.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.442
I know what you mean.           
I am bored.                     

00:10.510 --> 00:11.543
Ooh, ooh,                       
look at that.                   

00:11.611 --> 00:12.811
Look what                       
we got here.                    
      What?                     

00:12.879 --> 00:14.513
  Look.                         

00:14.581 --> 00:16.515
        Oh, it's the film critic
                  at Channel 11.

00:16.583 --> 00:19.251
No, it's the anchorman          
at Channel Eight.               

00:19.319 --> 00:22.654
          You want to,          
        uh... autograph?        
Yeah, yeah.                     

00:22.722 --> 00:24.723
Uh, excuse me.                  
        Hey, uh...              

00:24.824 --> 00:25.824
        Hi, guys.               
Hey.                            

00:25.892 --> 00:26.959
          How are you?          
Hey, uh,                        

00:27.027 --> 00:28.360
          we're really          
    big fans of yours.          

00:28.428 --> 00:29.728
Yeah.                           
                    Oh, well.   

00:29.796 --> 00:30.763
Can we get your autograph?      

00:30.830 --> 00:31.830
Yeah.                           
                     Yeah, sure.

00:31.898 --> 00:33.032
                Uh, here,       

00:33.099 --> 00:34.433
            let me get something
                    to write on.
     Need a pen?                

00:34.501 --> 00:36.201
                        Yeah.   
A full-service                  
autograph.                      

00:36.269 --> 00:37.536
         What a guy!            

00:37.604 --> 00:39.405
        Oh, yeah.               
You know, I love that, uh,      

00:39.472 --> 00:41.040
      that report you did       
      on that train wreck.      

00:41.107 --> 00:42.274
You know, they ought to get you 

00:42.342 --> 00:43.509

         as an anchor.

Oh, our Senator!                

00:50.250 --> 00:51.450
I'm sorry, man.                 

00:51.518 --> 00:52.785

to bother you.                  
      Sorry to bother you.      

00:57.090 --> 00:58.724
                Hey, wait, Norm,

00:58.792 --> 01:00.693
maybe he knows Senator Gopher   
             from <i>The Love Boat.</i>

                  Say, uh, Norm,

02:16.970 --> 02:18.804
      want to go back and,      
     uh, shoot some stick?      

02:18.872 --> 02:20.806
                Oh, I'd love to,
        Cliffie, but I'm busy   

02:20.874 --> 02:22.474
                  talking on the
                phone with Vera.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.476
            Huh?                
            Which reminds me.   

02:27.347 --> 02:29.581
Uh, what are you talking about? 

02:29.649 --> 02:32.017
         I'm listening          
     to every single word.      

02:33.386 --> 02:35.220
  Got this down to a science.   

02:35.288 --> 02:36.455
            Give me a refill,   
                  please, Woody.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.323
                        REBECCA:
                 Hey, everybody!

02:38.391 --> 02:40.526
I have the most wonderful news. 

02:40.593 --> 02:41.560
You got a job?                  

02:41.628 --> 02:43.762
         I have a job.          
                             Oh.

02:43.830 --> 02:44.830
I'm sorry.                      

02:44.898 --> 02:46.131
I confused                      
having a job                    

02:46.199 --> 02:48.100
with being paid                 
to actually do something.       

02:48.168 --> 02:50.969
    It spins just the same,     
             Carla.             

02:51.037 --> 02:52.438
I just got                      

02:52.505 --> 02:53.772
 a call from <i>Redbook</i> magazine,  

02:53.840 --> 02:55.574
    and I have been selected    

02:55.642 --> 02:57.576
    as one of the six Boston    
         businesswomen          

02:57.644 --> 03:00.579
      to get a full beauty      
        makeover.               

03:00.647 --> 03:03.315
And the final results will      
    be in their next issue.     

03:03.383 --> 03:05.117
Oh, that's too bad.             

03:05.185 --> 03:06.785
I always liked                  
 <i>Redbook.</i>                       

03:08.188 --> 03:10.222
Rebecca, I can't possibly think 

03:10.290 --> 03:12.257
 why you would need a makeover. 

03:12.325 --> 03:13.625
You're always                   
impeccably dressed.             

03:13.693 --> 03:14.760
You're constantly               

03:14.828 --> 03:17.162
            alluring            
without being overstated.       

03:17.230 --> 03:19.164
Well, thank you, Frasier.       

03:19.232 --> 03:23.168
Your eye makeup gives you       
a certain feline quality.       

03:23.236 --> 03:25.170
    It's irresistible.          
                        Mm.     

03:25.238 --> 03:27.673
And I can't see how anyone      
     could possibly improve     

03:27.741 --> 03:29.675
 on the way your hair cascades  
         down your face         

03:29.743 --> 03:31.677
in that peekaboo fashion.       

03:31.745 --> 03:34.913
    Much like my own darling    
            Lilith.             

03:34.981 --> 03:38.150
             Speak of the devil!

03:38.218 --> 03:39.985
            Not that you're a   
            devil, of course.   

03:40.053 --> 03:41.987
                Just, uh, the   
                 total opposite.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.989
             In fact, you're the
            complete opposite   
                of the devil.   

03:44.057 --> 03:46.492
                    You're i.e.,
                    an angel.   

03:46.559 --> 03:49.161
There's no need                 
to be nervous, Frasier.         

03:49.229 --> 03:50.496
It's perfectly                  
natural for you                 

03:50.563 --> 03:52.164
to be attracted                 
to other women.                 

03:52.232 --> 03:54.833
It shows you have a,            
a healthy sex drive.            

03:54.901 --> 03:56.835
I'm attracted                   
to other men.                   

03:56.903 --> 03:58.971
                Oh, no, not this
                     game again.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.473
Let's see,                      
where shall I begin?            

04:04.811 --> 04:06.812
        Yowsa!                  

04:06.880 --> 04:08.947
So Miss Howe's gonna            
be in <i>Redbook.</i>                  

04:09.015 --> 04:10.115
Well, what is that?             

04:10.183 --> 04:11.383
Some kind of fashion            
magazine?                       

04:11.451 --> 04:12.618
          Oh, no, no.           

04:12.686 --> 04:15.487
 It's, uh, more than a fashion  
        magazine, Woody.        

04:15.555 --> 04:16.755
It, it's about                  
today's women.                  

04:16.822 --> 04:18.257
You know, who they are,         

04:18.324 --> 04:19.425
uh, their wants,                
their needs.                    

04:20.627 --> 04:21.827
Cliffie, you read <i>Redbook?</i>      

04:21.894 --> 04:23.796
I don't so much                 
as read it, Norm.               

04:23.863 --> 04:26.165
I, uh, I do take some           
of the quizzes, though.         

04:28.301 --> 04:29.601
Would you believe               

04:29.669 --> 04:32.004
that I'm actually               
autumn complected?              

04:32.072 --> 04:35.007
  Hey, guys, you're not gonna   
         believe this.          

04:35.075 --> 04:37.142
        Gary sold               
     The Olde Towne Tavern.     

04:37.210 --> 04:38.143
                             No!
            Get out!            

04:38.211 --> 04:39.144
SAM:                            
No kidding.                     

04:39.212 --> 04:40.979
        He sold it              
    to this guy named Frank.    

04:41.047 --> 04:42.915
Uh, runs a bunch of bars        
in other cities.                

04:42.982 --> 04:44.083
        He's already in.        

04:44.150 --> 04:45.317
                  Wait a minute.
                 This means that

04:45.385 --> 04:47.786
        any bar tab run         
 under the previous management  

04:47.854 --> 04:49.254
  would automatically be null   
        and void, right?        

04:49.322 --> 04:52.191
 You have a bar tab at Gary's?  

04:52.258 --> 04:53.692
    Not anymore, Sam.           

04:54.761 --> 04:57.863
          Oh, no more Gary's?   

04:57.931 --> 05:00.399
         I can't believe that!  

05:00.467 --> 05:02.401
             You know, in a way,
                I'm gonna really
                  miss that guy.

05:02.502 --> 05:03.669
Miss him?                       
You kidding me?                 
                        Yeah.   

05:03.737 --> 05:05.404
Worst thing                     
that ever happened to me.       

05:05.472 --> 05:07.306
I've never been happier         
to see a guy go.                

05:07.374 --> 05:08.574
            Aw, come on, Sam.   

05:08.641 --> 05:09.775
Nah, he was terrible.           

05:09.843 --> 05:10.909
He even turned                  
you guys,                       

05:10.977 --> 05:12.244
my good friends,                
against me.                     

05:12.312 --> 05:13.812
                     Huh?       
You remember                    
Halloween?                      

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
                Oh.             
When you                        
convinced me                    

05:14.948 --> 05:15.948
that I killed                   
the man?                        

05:16.016 --> 05:17.850
Ha ha.                          
            (laughs)            

05:17.917 --> 05:21.020
        Yeah, you hate to see   
          the great ones retire.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.022
    Boy, without Gary,          
    what's left for us, huh?    

05:23.089 --> 05:25.457
So, huh,                        
what do you think?              

05:25.525 --> 05:27.893
You ready to start a rivalry    
with the, uh, new bar?          

05:27.961 --> 05:29.061
      What are you talking      
             about?             

05:29.129 --> 05:30.262
             Yeah.              
Come on.                        

05:30.330 --> 05:31.764
It's a golden opportunity.      

05:31.898 --> 05:33.298
We can win this time.           

05:33.366 --> 05:35.300
We can steal                    
all of Gary's best ideas        

05:35.368 --> 05:36.869
and use 'em                     
against this new guy.           

05:36.936 --> 05:38.704
And you remember how Gary's     
always going first?             

05:38.772 --> 05:39.872
We can learn                    
from that.                      

05:39.939 --> 05:41.874
We can move first               
ourselves.                      

05:41.941 --> 05:43.075
                 Very good, Sam.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.777
As that famous                  
prankster                       

05:44.844 --> 05:46.612
                    Santayana   
                      once said,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.447
            "Those who do not   
              learn from history

05:48.515 --> 05:49.948
                are condemned   
                  to repeat it."

05:50.016 --> 05:51.950
      You got that right,       
         Doctor Crane.          

05:52.018 --> 05:53.552
      Back in high school       
        I was condemned         

05:53.620 --> 05:55.554
 to repeat History three times. 

05:57.724 --> 05:59.958
By the way, the same goes       
        for Mathematics.        

06:01.795 --> 06:03.095
Come on, come on.               

06:03.163 --> 06:04.730
What do you say                 
we show this Frank guy          

06:04.798 --> 06:05.964
there's another bar             
in town?                        

06:06.032 --> 06:07.766
            Do we really want to
                let ourselves in

06:07.834 --> 06:09.134
                for that kind of
              humiliation again?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.570
      Sure!                     

06:11.638 --> 06:13.238
Oh, no, no, Sam,                
I think Normie's right.         

06:13.306 --> 06:14.840
I mean, if there's one thing    
Gary taught us                  

06:14.908 --> 06:17.643
it's that we're nothing         
but a bunch of losers.          

06:17.711 --> 06:19.945
Yeah, but the new guys          
don't know that.                

06:20.013 --> 06:21.747
Well, let's show 'em,           
         huh?                   

06:21.815 --> 06:23.749
                        Yeah!   

06:28.488 --> 06:31.090
                Okay, I'll be   
                     right back.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.424
                Okay.           
            (gasps)             

06:32.492 --> 06:34.093
             Look at me!        
         Lilith, look at me!    

06:34.160 --> 06:35.928
Isn't this                      
exciting?                       
                    Yes.        

06:35.995 --> 06:38.931
        Every so often people   
                need to recreate
                     themselves.

06:38.998 --> 06:41.934
              And frequently the
          metamorphosis has very
            positive results.   

06:42.002 --> 06:44.269
You should've seen              

06:44.337 --> 06:46.605
what I looked like              
back in my college days.        

06:46.673 --> 06:48.640
     Bowwow!                    

06:50.710 --> 06:52.978
So, Rebecca, you're having      
a makeover, huh?                

06:53.046 --> 06:54.313
                Yes.            

06:54.381 --> 06:56.281
You know, uh, I don't           
understand. I mean,             

06:56.349 --> 06:58.550
if there was ever a person      
  who didn't need a makeover,   

06:58.618 --> 06:59.818
        it's you.               

06:59.886 --> 07:01.453
     I think you're perfect     
     just the way you are.      

07:01.521 --> 07:04.023
Oh, well, thank you, Paul.      

07:04.090 --> 07:06.025
 Boobs, too, or just the face?  

07:09.696 --> 07:11.463
         Just the face.         

07:11.531 --> 07:13.499
              Eh.               

07:17.904 --> 07:19.838
        (Norm chuckles)         

07:21.775 --> 07:23.275
                 I assume you've
                    just come   

07:23.343 --> 07:25.010
            from the new Olde   
                Towne Tavern.   

07:25.078 --> 07:26.645
      Yeah, we went for an      
    often used stunt,           

07:26.713 --> 07:28.313
      but one that's sure       
    to bring a smile.           

07:28.381 --> 07:30.182
          (laughs)              
            We teepeed the whole
             front of the place.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.550
          And how will they know

07:31.618 --> 07:33.719
    that you're the dastardly   
         ones that did the deed?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.054
LILITH:                         
Good question.                  

07:35.121 --> 07:38.157
Could have been the Mensa       
chapter from M.I.T.             

07:38.224 --> 07:40.159
  Ah, we soaped their windows   

07:40.226 --> 07:42.027
"Regards from your friends      
          at Cheers."           

07:42.095 --> 07:43.228
                        NORM:   
            Yeah, and I threw   
                     a few packs

07:43.296 --> 07:45.531
        of "Cheers" matches with
        our address in there.   

07:45.598 --> 07:48.801
  I stuck my head in the door   
  and yelled, "Cheers rules!"   

07:48.868 --> 07:49.968
                            SAM:
                Yeah, if they   

07:50.036 --> 07:51.136
can't figure that out,          

07:51.204 --> 07:53.005
they're the stupidest           
bar in town.                    

07:53.073 --> 07:54.707
              Ooh, I wouldn't go
                  that far, Sam.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.608
                So all we got to
                  do now is, uh,

07:56.676 --> 07:58.877
        sit back and see what   
     these guys are made out of.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.212
Yeah, I can't wait              
to see                          

08:00.280 --> 08:02.881
what weenie retaliation         
Frank comes up with, huh?       

08:02.949 --> 08:05.451
      Yeah, yeah, it'll be      
the standard novice stuff.      

08:05.518 --> 08:07.152
      You know, rubber rat      
         behind the bar         

08:07.220 --> 08:08.754
                or something.   
              Yeah, stealing the
                 sign out front.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.356
     Having 20 pizzas           
        delivered.              

08:10.423 --> 08:11.623
Oh!                             
              Yeah, whatever    
                  it is,        

08:11.691 --> 08:13.092
 there won't be any imagination 
        connected to it.        

08:13.159 --> 08:14.393
    These guys are rookies.     

08:14.461 --> 08:15.561
      They'll just come up      
    with something pathetic.    

08:15.628 --> 08:17.096
          (explosion)           

08:17.163 --> 08:19.198
        (loud thudding)         

08:22.802 --> 08:24.336
    Well, we better get this    
        cleaned up              

08:24.404 --> 08:25.904
before the pizza arrives.       

08:37.116 --> 08:39.018
        I'm here to take some   
    pictures of the wreckage.   

08:39.085 --> 08:41.053
Oh, she's way                   
over there.                     

08:45.325 --> 08:48.560
So, uh, you're a <i>Redbook</i>        
photographer, huh?              
                         Mm-hmm.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.929
    How'd you manage to land    
        this assignment?        

08:50.997 --> 08:52.931
              Mouthed off to one
                 of the editors.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.868
OFFICER:                        
So, uh, Mr. Malone,             

08:55.935 --> 08:57.736
do you have any idea            
who could have done this?       

08:57.804 --> 08:58.971
                     Yeah, I do.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.306
         The new owner of Gary's
              Olde Towne Tavern.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.975
              A guy named Frank.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.810
        See, what happened is we
            went over, you know,

09:04.878 --> 09:06.145
                in the spirit of
                gamesmanship,   

09:06.212 --> 09:08.213
  and I gave him the old welcome
            to the neighborhood.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.248
              Teepeed their bar.

09:09.315 --> 09:10.716
FRASIER:                        
Yeah, we considered             

09:10.884 --> 09:12.918
plastic explosives              
on their front door,            

09:12.986 --> 09:15.254
              but thought, "Nah,
                     too funny."

09:16.890 --> 09:18.791
        Do you have any idea who
    you're dealing with here?   

09:18.858 --> 09:19.858
            What do you mean?   

09:19.926 --> 09:21.794
How do I explain it             
to you? Um,                     

09:21.861 --> 09:23.796
this guy Frank is               
kind of "connected,"            

09:23.863 --> 09:25.064
if you know what I mean.        

09:25.131 --> 09:27.066
Wow, he wears a pacemaker?      

09:27.133 --> 09:28.200
        Oh, now I really        

09:28.268 --> 09:29.535
                feel bad.       

09:29.602 --> 09:31.570
    No, no, you don't           
    understand.                 

09:31.638 --> 09:33.339
    His full name is Frank      

09:33.406 --> 09:35.507
"The Angel of Death"            
Carpaccio.                      

09:35.575 --> 09:36.842
This guy's associated           

09:36.910 --> 09:38.677
with some very bad              
individuals.                    

09:38.745 --> 09:39.745
              You're kidding me!

09:39.813 --> 09:41.213
I'm afraid not.                 

09:41.281 --> 09:42.614
                 Oh, my God!    

09:42.682 --> 09:44.850
              We just teepeed   
                a mob bar.      

09:44.918 --> 09:46.218
If you want,                    
Mr. Malone,                     

09:46.286 --> 09:47.920
I suppose you can               
press charges.                  

09:47.987 --> 09:49.922
Of course, I saw some           
pictures of people              

09:49.989 --> 09:52.091
who pressed charges             
against Mr. Carpaccio           

09:52.158 --> 09:53.926
and his associates              
on different occasions.         

09:53.993 --> 09:56.829
It turned my stomach.           

09:56.896 --> 09:59.398
            Wait'll you get next
                month's <i>Redbook.</i>

10:02.035 --> 10:03.969
     Uh, look,                  

10:04.037 --> 10:05.237
it'd probably                   
be a good idea                  

10:05.305 --> 10:07.306
to just let the whole thing     
rest, you know what I mean?     

10:07.374 --> 10:08.374
      Yeah, thanks, yeah.       
Oh,                             

10:08.441 --> 10:09.775
      uh, one other thing.      

10:09.843 --> 10:11.910
      Uh, we're not gonna       
be much help to you here.       

10:11.978 --> 10:13.912
 You see, uh, we're all scared  
          of the guy,           

10:13.980 --> 10:16.915
and we pretty much let him      
     do whatever he wants.      

10:18.752 --> 10:22.287
          Boy, I feel safer with
              those guys around.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.756
        Oh, holy mother!        

10:23.923 --> 10:25.224
    What have we done?          

10:25.291 --> 10:27.026
          Oh, come on.          
     We didn't know, Carla.     

10:27.093 --> 10:28.327
You don't understand, Sam.      

10:28.395 --> 10:29.928
  This is not gonna end here.   

10:29.996 --> 10:31.930
I mean, these guys are new      
            in town.            

10:31.998 --> 10:34.066
They're gonna want to make      
     examples of all of us.     

10:34.134 --> 10:35.601
             If I may interject,

10:35.669 --> 10:37.670
     I think you've all seen too
          many <i>Godfather</i> movies.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.772
            I agree.            
  Should have stopped at two.   

10:40.874 --> 10:42.808
        That notwithstanding,   

10:42.876 --> 10:44.176
                I don't think   
                    we should   

10:44.244 --> 10:45.544
                    run off in a
                     panic here.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.979
              Don't you see what
                    we're doing?

10:47.047 --> 10:48.480
              We're stereotyping
                    these people

10:48.548 --> 10:50.416
and letting our irrational      
fears convince us               

10:50.483 --> 10:52.384
             that they intend to
            do us bodily harm   

10:52.452 --> 10:54.386
            in some cold-blooded
                        fashion.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.055
            Now, with that said,

10:56.122 --> 10:58.724
            I will bid you all a
                fond adieu for a
                couple of weeks.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.392
Lilith,                         

11:00.460 --> 11:02.394
             Frederick and I are
              going on vacation.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.229
                    What are you
                  talking about?

11:04.297 --> 11:05.664
Oh, don't you                   
remember                        

11:05.732 --> 11:07.533
             that trip we talked
                    about, dear?
We didn't plan a trip.          

11:07.600 --> 11:09.168
         Oh, it'll all come back
              to you in the cab.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.869
                    Let's go.   
                        Come on.
But I need                      
my briefcase.                   

11:10.937 --> 11:12.705
      No, leave it, woman!      
             Move!              
Oh!                             

11:12.772 --> 11:14.106
                          CARLA:
                      Look, Sam,

11:14.174 --> 11:15.541
I know these people.            
Okay?                           

11:15.608 --> 11:17.810
I mean, it's one thing          
to be into them for money.      

11:17.877 --> 11:19.478
They got a sense                
of humor about that.            

11:19.546 --> 11:20.746
                But it's another
                        thing   

11:20.814 --> 11:22.181
to humiliate them               
like we did.                    

11:22.248 --> 11:23.782
I mean, they're not             
gonna forget about this.        

11:23.850 --> 11:25.117
Oh, you know,                   
Carla's right.                  

11:25.185 --> 11:26.719
The only thing                  
we can do is                    

11:26.786 --> 11:28.887
 go over and apologize to Frank 

11:28.955 --> 11:31.390
      "The Angel of Death"      
        Carpaccio.              
                Nah, Cliffie,   

11:31.458 --> 11:32.491
         that's not gonna do it.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.460
        We have to go over there
              and beg like dogs.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.894
        Okay.                   
SAM:                            
Oh, no, wait a second,          

11:35.962 --> 11:37.029
wait a second.                  
                        NORM:   
                        What?   

11:37.097 --> 11:38.297
I just had                      
a thought here.                 

11:38.365 --> 11:40.199
                        What?   
Who would like                  
to see us beg                   

11:40.266 --> 11:42.634
more than anyone else           
in the whole world?             

11:42.702 --> 11:44.003
        Sammy, you don't suppose

11:44.070 --> 11:45.604
              Vera's behind this
            whole thing, do you?

11:46.706 --> 11:49.575
No, I'm talking                 
about Gary.                     

11:49.642 --> 11:50.776
                     Gary?      
  Yeah.                         

11:50.844 --> 11:52.745
             What do you mean?  
Well, think about it.           

11:52.812 --> 11:54.880
I mean, the guy sells his bar   
and disappears.                 

11:54.948 --> 11:57.449
The guy who buys it all of      
a sudden moves in instantly.    

11:57.517 --> 11:59.251
I mean, come on,                
we're being set up.             

11:59.319 --> 12:00.452
We're a bunch                   
of suckers.                     

12:00.520 --> 12:02.254
     You think?                 
Yeah.                           

12:02.322 --> 12:03.655
Remember Halloween?             

12:03.723 --> 12:05.457
The guy crawled                 
into a coffin, you know,        

12:05.525 --> 12:06.492
and pretended                   
to be dead                      

12:06.559 --> 12:08.627
just to scare                   
the bejeebers out of me.        

12:08.695 --> 12:09.928
(Woody laughing)                

12:09.996 --> 12:11.964
            Yeah, I'm glad we   
            got that on tape.   

12:12.032 --> 12:13.065
                      (laughing)

12:13.133 --> 12:15.367
You got that                    
on tape?                        

12:15.435 --> 12:18.804
                     I'm talking
                    out of turn.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.106
            I-I-I get this,     
                 I get this.    

12:21.174 --> 12:24.410
You mean, we go over to Gary's  
crying like babies,             

12:24.477 --> 12:27.279
and Gary jumps out of the wall  
laughing his head off.          

12:27.347 --> 12:29.715
How many times does Gary have   
to make us look like jerks      

12:29.783 --> 12:31.316
before we wise up, huh?         

12:31.384 --> 12:32.551
                 Well, you know,
             there's some things

12:32.619 --> 12:34.319
                  you just can't
                put a number on.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.355
            Hold it, hold it,   
        hold it, hold it now.   

12:36.423 --> 12:38.490
            You mean when all   
            is said and done,   

12:38.558 --> 12:41.160
at the end of this, I'm still   
  going to have a tab at Gary's?

12:41.227 --> 12:42.995
              Yes, Norm.        

12:43.063 --> 12:44.630
                That bastard,   
                  let's get him.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.265
         I got an idea.         

12:46.332 --> 12:48.133
  Why don't we just play along  
        with this, huh?         

12:48.201 --> 12:51.870
    Why don't we go over there  
    and, uh, "apologize?"       

12:51.938 --> 12:53.906
      Yeah, I see what you mean.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.008
            We apologize to him.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.209
                     Yeah.      
             Yeah, that's right,

12:57.277 --> 12:59.244
apologize in a big way.         

12:59.312 --> 13:00.512
              ALL:              
             Yeah.              

13:00.580 --> 13:04.950
Apologize like he's never been  
apologized to before.           

13:05.018 --> 13:05.951
              ALL:              
             Yeah.              

13:06.019 --> 13:07.453
This is great.                  

13:07.520 --> 13:08.754
What are we doing?              

13:09.856 --> 13:12.825
I'll explain it                 
to you later, Woody.            

13:12.892 --> 13:16.061
  Yeah, well, uh, can we keep   
    talking in these voices?    

13:16.129 --> 13:17.396
    Hey, Mr. Krapence,          

13:17.464 --> 13:20.933
  tell Miss Howe we'll be back  
         after a while.         

13:33.580 --> 13:35.547
Boy, every time I set foot      
         in this place,         

13:35.615 --> 13:36.882
it gives me the creeps.         

13:36.950 --> 13:38.350
ALL:                            
Norm!                           

13:40.420 --> 13:42.021
 How do they know you in here?  

13:42.088 --> 13:43.789
Hey, Sammy closes               
on Christmas morning.           

13:43.857 --> 13:45.591
Okay?                           

13:45.658 --> 13:49.194
            Excuse me, uh, is   
        Mr. Carpaccio around?   

13:50.296 --> 13:52.398
Oh, Gary went all the way,      
didn't he?                      

13:52.465 --> 13:53.432
Look at that guy.               

13:53.500 --> 13:56.769
Dark shirt,                     
shiny suit, jewelry.            

13:56.836 --> 14:00.239
      If you want to get a girl,
you got to know how to dress.   

14:02.308 --> 14:04.743
          Uh, fellas?           

14:06.546 --> 14:08.580
Excuse me, uh,                  
Mr. Carpaccio?                  

14:08.648 --> 14:09.982
    Yeah, what is it?           

14:10.050 --> 14:12.851
                My name's Sam   
                    Malone, sir.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.053
              We're from Cheers.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.189
        Oh, yeah.               

14:17.257 --> 14:19.758
  You're a bunch of funny guys  
    over there, aren't you?     

14:19.826 --> 14:23.896
      Uh, yeah, about that, sir,
        we're here to apologize.

14:23.963 --> 14:25.564
            You are?            

14:25.632 --> 14:27.266
Oh, yes, sir,                   
you see, uh,                    

14:27.334 --> 14:29.768
                we had this kind
             of friendly rivalry

14:29.836 --> 14:31.337
            with the previous   
                    owner, Gary,

14:31.404 --> 14:33.005
            and, you know, we   
        just thought we'd try   

14:33.073 --> 14:35.040
to start a little something     
with you, that's all.           

14:35.108 --> 14:36.375
                  We didn't mean
                 any harm by it.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.676
    Well, Mr. Malone,           

14:37.744 --> 14:40.245
    I appreciate your coming    
down here to tell me this.      

14:40.313 --> 14:41.580
     Shows you got respect.     

14:41.648 --> 14:42.748
              I didn't scare you

14:42.816 --> 14:44.116
        too much, did I?        

14:44.184 --> 14:45.384
            (laughs)            

14:47.954 --> 14:49.154
                    Yes, sir,   
                    you know,   

14:49.222 --> 14:51.190
it'll take much more            
than an exploding door          

14:51.291 --> 14:52.925
to, uh, scare off               
Clifford Clavin.                

14:52.992 --> 14:54.026
                      Well, what
                about that clown

14:54.094 --> 14:57.796
                at the car wash?

14:57.864 --> 14:59.765
I'm a little bit frightened     
of clowns, okay?                

14:59.833 --> 15:01.633
It's normal.                    

15:01.701 --> 15:03.369
Well, the incident is forgotten;
    it never happened.          

15:03.436 --> 15:04.803
Thank you                       
very much.                      

15:04.871 --> 15:06.472
          Now, that's a load off
            our minds, isn't it?
    Yeah.                       

15:07.540 --> 15:10.142
  Say, you're the, uh,          

15:10.210 --> 15:12.244
      barmaid over there,       
     aren't you, at Cheers?     

15:12.312 --> 15:14.179
 Yeah, I am.                    
                            Hey,

15:14.247 --> 15:16.415
        you know,               
  we need a new one over here.  

15:16.483 --> 15:19.251
      We had one, but, uh,      
  she was a big blabbermouth.   

15:19.319 --> 15:20.486
            (laughs)            

15:22.555 --> 15:24.656
Sorry, I got a job.             

15:24.724 --> 15:25.991
SAM:                            
Actually, you know,             
we were thinking,               

15:26.059 --> 15:28.093
    this being a new business   
            and all, we thought,

15:28.161 --> 15:30.496
    you know, maybe you could   
      use a few extra customers.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.464
Just to show you                
we're not, uh,                  

15:32.532 --> 15:34.933
having any hard feelings here,  
we thought                      

15:35.001 --> 15:36.535
                we'd fill the   
            place up for you.   

15:36.603 --> 15:39.972
You know who's really           
a thirsty bunch, Sam?           

15:40.040 --> 15:41.040
    Firemen.                    

15:41.141 --> 15:43.342
Oh, that's a good idea,         
firemen.                        

15:43.410 --> 15:45.344
             Now, how can we get
     firemen in here in a hurry?

15:45.445 --> 15:48.514
You just leave it               
to me.                          

15:48.581 --> 15:49.515
        (alarm ringing)         

15:54.287 --> 15:56.522
How's that, Gary,               
wet enough for you?             

15:56.589 --> 15:58.290
              ALL:              
¶ Singing in the rain... ¶      

15:58.358 --> 16:00.959
CARPACCIO:                      
Hey, what the hell is this?!    

16:01.027 --> 16:03.362
     You people don't know      
who you're fooling around with! 

16:03.430 --> 16:04.963
You're dead!                    

16:05.031 --> 16:06.198
You're dead,                    
do you hear me?                 

16:06.266 --> 16:08.967
      Your family-- dead!       

16:09.035 --> 16:10.736
      Your friends-- dead!      

16:10.804 --> 16:12.538
    Your pets-- dead!           

16:12.605 --> 16:14.807
    Dead, dead, dead!           

16:16.509 --> 16:18.444
          (door opens)          

16:20.547 --> 16:23.615
    Well, I understand          
 congratulations are in order.  

16:23.683 --> 16:24.750
You beat Gary                   
at his own game.                

16:24.818 --> 16:26.218
Gee, I...                       

16:26.286 --> 16:28.721
  wish I could have been there  
with you when you did it.       

16:28.788 --> 16:31.190
Well, maybe you could have      
if you hadn't run out of here   

16:31.257 --> 16:33.492
with your tail                  
between your legs.              

16:33.560 --> 16:34.827
 Well, Carla, in my profession  

16:34.894 --> 16:36.462
      we encourage people       
to go with their feelings,      

16:36.529 --> 16:37.863
  and at that time my feelings  

16:37.931 --> 16:41.166
  were stark, gibbering terror  
  and borderline incontinence.  

16:41.234 --> 16:44.169
Oh, that's all right,           
Dr. Crane, we all get scared.   

16:44.237 --> 16:45.437
                    For example,
                 when Mr. Clavin

16:45.505 --> 16:47.439
sees that clown                 
outside the car wash,           

16:47.507 --> 16:49.842
he starts screaming             
at the top of his lungs.        

16:49.909 --> 16:52.411
     I got a phobia, okay?      

16:52.479 --> 16:53.846
  Let me tell you a story here  

16:53.913 --> 16:54.880
      about a sweet little      
         eight-year-old         

16:54.948 --> 16:56.215
      called Cliff Clavin.      

16:56.282 --> 16:59.151
         On his eighth birthday,
        his ma hires a clown.   

16:59.219 --> 17:00.586
              Great idea, right?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.588
     Except for one thing.      

17:02.655 --> 17:04.356
None of the other kids show up. 

17:06.092 --> 17:09.595
  So here I am with this clown  
        for five hours.         

17:11.664 --> 17:13.632
                Just me and him,
                back and forth--

17:13.733 --> 17:16.435
                    "Yeah, yeah,
              yeah, yeah, yeah."

17:16.502 --> 17:18.369
    I keep screaming,           
    "Enough, enough,"           

17:18.438 --> 17:21.339
    but, no, Ma wanted          
to get her money's worth.       

17:21.407 --> 17:22.340
(door opens)                    

17:23.443 --> 17:25.544
Excuse me,                      
are you Sam Malone?             

17:25.612 --> 17:26.545
                        Yeah,   

17:26.613 --> 17:27.813
what can I do                   
for you?                        

17:27.881 --> 17:28.981
        I'm Inspector Hanson.   

17:29.049 --> 17:30.416
Agent Carmichael, FBI.          

17:30.483 --> 17:33.118
 We have some business with you 
  regarding a Frank Carpaccio.  

17:33.186 --> 17:34.953
Oh, man, Gary doesn't give up,  
does he?                        

17:35.021 --> 17:36.288
        (laughs)                

17:36.356 --> 17:40.959
    How do we, uh, know you     
gentlemen are from the FBI, huh?

17:43.063 --> 17:44.229
          Yeah, yeah.           

17:44.297 --> 17:45.998
That's the real McCoy,          
all right, Sammy.               

17:46.066 --> 17:48.267
It's not like the one I got     
down at the mall.               

17:49.903 --> 17:51.503
We've been conducting           
an investigation                

17:51.571 --> 17:53.005
into the activities             
of Mr. Carpaccio,               

17:53.073 --> 17:54.673
also known                      
as "The Angel of Death."        

17:54.741 --> 17:56.575
      Well, wait a minute.      
    What are you telling me?    

17:56.643 --> 17:58.410
 Are you telling me this guy's  
     a legitimate criminal?     

17:58.478 --> 18:00.512
I've spent five years in court  
trying to prove that.           

18:00.580 --> 18:01.814
Only every time I get close,    

18:01.881 --> 18:03.515
my star witness ends up         
in some warehouse               

18:03.583 --> 18:04.783
dangling from a meat hook.      

18:04.851 --> 18:06.251
Well, I'd love to stay and chat,

18:06.319 --> 18:08.854
but I'm wasting                 
precious vacation time.         

18:08.922 --> 18:10.255
CARMICHAEL:                     
Anyway, yesterday evening,      

18:10.323 --> 18:12.057
we made a recording             
of a conversation               

18:12.125 --> 18:14.259
in which Mr. Carpaccio          
threatened you, Mr. Malone,     

18:14.327 --> 18:16.328
along with several other        
unidentified people,            

18:16.396 --> 18:18.430
whose lives                     
are all in danger now.          

18:18.498 --> 18:20.699
                     Oh, my God.
                     Oh, my God!

18:20.767 --> 18:22.501
                  Wait a minute.
             What does this have
                  to do with us?

18:22.569 --> 18:24.169
Well, we'd like all of you      
to testify                      

18:24.237 --> 18:25.270
against Mr. Carpaccio           
in court.                       

18:25.338 --> 18:26.739
        Excuse me.              

18:26.906 --> 18:29.441
                  What? What are
                      you doing?

18:29.509 --> 18:30.909
Look, if I can get to confession
          fast enough,          

18:30.977 --> 18:32.878
     maybe I can get capped     
      in a state of grace.      

18:32.946 --> 18:34.546
                 Carla, come on,
          that's not gonna help.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.349
Look, Sam, they want us to sing 
against this guy in court, okay?

18:37.417 --> 18:38.784
    We'll all be dead.          

18:38.852 --> 18:40.919
              Us?               
      What about our pets?      

18:40.987 --> 18:42.521
                     Oh, my God!
                     Oh, my God!

18:42.589 --> 18:43.689
        What are we gonna do?   

18:43.757 --> 18:45.057
It's all your fault,            
Peterson.                       
                        What?   

18:45.125 --> 18:47.126
You're the one                  
who wanted us                   
to go back there.               

18:47.193 --> 18:48.794
          Yeah, but Carla pulled
            the damn fire alarm!

18:48.862 --> 18:50.062
      Hey, don't blame me!      

18:50.130 --> 18:51.730
 Sam's the one who made us buy  
         the umbrellas.         

18:51.798 --> 18:53.832
         Hey, Norm choreographed
              the stupid number!

18:59.105 --> 19:01.674
It took a team                  
of four men 12 hours,           

19:01.741 --> 19:03.609
but I think I'm worth it.       

19:03.677 --> 19:04.710
What do you think?              

19:04.778 --> 19:06.345
About what?                     

19:06.413 --> 19:09.048
About me!                       
About the new way I look.       

19:09.115 --> 19:10.616
             Hey, honey, we're a
          little busy right now.

19:10.684 --> 19:12.017
                    Do you mind?

19:12.085 --> 19:13.752
I mean, we just found out       
  that we insulted a mob boss   

19:13.820 --> 19:15.054
      and he's threatened       
          to kill us.           

19:15.121 --> 19:16.755
  We could be in a little bit   
     of trouble right now.      

19:16.823 --> 19:20.592
But I'm blonde. See?            

19:20.660 --> 19:22.327
            You don't get it,   
                do you, Rebecca?

19:22.395 --> 19:24.630
              This isn't a game.
        We could all get killed.

19:24.698 --> 19:27.433
Yeah, but look.                 
Even my roots are blonde.       

19:27.500 --> 19:29.768
Rebecca, would you just shut up 
     for a second, please?      

19:29.836 --> 19:31.103
All right, fine.                

19:31.171 --> 19:34.740
I'll just go show people        
who are less self-absorbed.     

19:36.276 --> 19:40.079
  Hey, everybody, look at me!   
          Look at me!           

19:40.146 --> 19:42.514
Listen, people,                 
we've got to act                
quickly here.                   

19:42.582 --> 19:44.683
We're moving in on Carpaccio    
sometime during the week.       

19:44.751 --> 19:47.186
In the meantime, we'll have     
to relocate all of you          

19:47.253 --> 19:48.220
until he's safely               
behind bars.                    

19:48.288 --> 19:49.788
                  We have to get
              moving right away.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.889
There's a bus outside.          

19:50.957 --> 19:52.458
What about my kids?             

19:52.525 --> 19:54.560
Well, we'll assign an agent     
to take care of them.           

19:54.627 --> 19:55.594
      Will he have a gun?       

19:55.662 --> 19:56.628
Oh, yes, he will.               

19:56.696 --> 19:58.564
Then he's got a fighting chance.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.666
            Let's go, people!   

20:02.969 --> 20:04.470
    No, wait a minute,          
 wait a minute. I'm not going.  

20:04.537 --> 20:05.637
    What do you mean?           

20:05.705 --> 20:06.872
                Listen, this is,
          this is my whole life.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.741
 You know, I've worked too long 
          and too hard          

20:08.808 --> 20:11.043
     to give up everything      
    that's important to me.     

20:11.111 --> 20:13.212
    You're taking               
 quite a risk, Mr. Malone.      

20:13.279 --> 20:15.481
I-I can't live my life in fear. 

20:15.548 --> 20:17.349
        Well, we all can.       
         And time's a-wasting.  

20:17.417 --> 20:18.484
        Let's go.               

20:18.551 --> 20:19.818
            Hold it, hold it.   

20:19.886 --> 20:21.587
If Sam's not going,             
I'm not going either.           

20:21.654 --> 20:23.255
        What?                   

20:23.323 --> 20:24.456
    Oh, Woody, wait a second.   

20:24.524 --> 20:26.058
              I, I can't let you
                 take that risk.

20:26.126 --> 20:27.893
As long                         
as you understand, Sam.         

20:27.961 --> 20:29.561
Let's make tracks, folks.       

20:47.414 --> 20:48.514
          This is it?           

20:48.581 --> 20:50.449
            Where's the agent   
            supposed to meet us?

20:50.517 --> 20:53.118
Maybe we'd better get back      
        on the bus, huh?        

20:53.186 --> 20:54.119
        Hey. Hey!               

20:54.187 --> 20:55.287
Whoa! Whoa!                     

20:57.824 --> 20:59.925
        The last bus of the day.

20:59.993 --> 21:00.926
    Swell.                      

21:00.994 --> 21:02.394
                I'm freezing.   

21:02.562 --> 21:03.562
I'm hungry.                     

21:03.630 --> 21:04.930
                    I'm thirsty.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.932
             Guy wouldn't let me
        take my beer on the bus.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.033
Yeah, we know that,             
Norm.                           

21:08.101 --> 21:09.802
You only said it                
about a thousand times.         

21:09.869 --> 21:10.836
              Well, he wouldn't.

21:10.904 --> 21:11.904
         (phone rings)          

21:11.971 --> 21:14.340
    Must be the agent.          

21:16.176 --> 21:17.276
                 Hello?         

21:17.344 --> 21:18.911
        Carla, hi!              

21:18.978 --> 21:19.912
                      Sam?      

21:19.979 --> 21:20.913
         How you doing?         

21:20.980 --> 21:22.448
                    Terrible!   

21:22.515 --> 21:24.149
            We're stuck out here
    in the middle of nowhere,   

21:24.217 --> 21:26.151
             waiting for someone
                  to pick us up.

21:26.219 --> 21:27.720
    You're all alone?           

21:27.787 --> 21:29.288
Yeah, for about 200 miles.      

21:29.356 --> 21:31.457
        Wow! Is it cold?        

21:31.524 --> 21:34.093
            Yeah, Sam, I'm cold.
                I'm freezing.   

21:34.160 --> 21:35.427
                    I'm thinking
        about hugging Clavin.   

21:37.197 --> 21:39.131
    Boy, what a shame.          

21:39.199 --> 21:42.668
      Hey, listen, honey,       
you remember, uh, last Halloween

21:42.736 --> 21:45.971
when you guys pulled that       
     hilarious stunt on me      

21:46.039 --> 21:48.173
        making me think         
    that Gary was dead          

21:48.241 --> 21:49.742
and that I was responsible      
            for it?             

21:49.809 --> 21:50.676
                    Yeah.       

21:50.744 --> 21:51.710
            Well...             

21:51.778 --> 21:54.380
            gotcha!             

22:00.653 --> 22:02.054
    Now let me get              
    this straight, Sam.         

22:02.122 --> 22:05.024
This, this was all              
your doing?                     

22:05.091 --> 22:07.559
                      (laughing)

22:07.627 --> 22:09.695
The exploding door              
and all that damage             

22:09.763 --> 22:11.430
that you did                    
to your own bar?                

22:11.498 --> 22:12.664
                      (laughing)

22:12.732 --> 22:15.300
The expense of paying           
all the people involved?        

22:15.368 --> 22:17.603
The bus fare                    
to get your stooges             

22:17.671 --> 22:19.271
all the way out                 
to North Dakota?                

22:19.339 --> 22:21.373
     It cost me a fortune!      

22:21.441 --> 22:23.208
I had to take out a loan!       

22:23.276 --> 22:24.910
                      (laughing)

22:24.978 --> 22:27.413
            I'll be paying it   
              off for ten years!

22:27.480 --> 22:29.848
                      (laughing)

22:29.916 --> 22:33.285
          Well, I guess the joke
 certainly is on them, isn't it?

22:36.489 --> 22:38.957
             CLIFF:             
Boy, he really rubbed our noses 
    in it, didn't he?           

22:39.025 --> 22:40.592
                          CARLA:
        You got to love the guy.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.227
             NORM:              
      I'm a better person       
    just knowing him.           

22:42.295 --> 22:44.897
             WOODY:             
    Well, at least out here     
 we're safe from that mob guy.  

22:44.964 --> 22:46.699
             NORM:              
         No, no, Woody.         

22:46.766 --> 22:48.834
    Let me explain it to you    
         one more time.
