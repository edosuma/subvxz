Dewey.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.925
Is that what
I think it is?

00:15.711 --> 00:18.018
You know the rules
about animals in the house.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.150
Okay, okay, I'll get rid of it.

LOIS:
And we can all

01:15.118 --> 01:17.773
thank Reese
for the wonderful dinner

01:17.860 --> 01:19.992
he brought home from work.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.298
Oh, way to go, son.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.517
And someday,
all that toner I keep

01:22.604 --> 01:24.345
bringing home
will come in handy, too.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.998
So, what's new and exciting

01:26.086 --> 01:28.523
-down at the old
meat packing plant?
-Tons.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.786
They have me back on the floor
where all the action is.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.831
And they upgraded
to the new Slaughter-Bot.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.268
Now it has
six chainsaw arms,

01:34.355 --> 01:36.879
and it doesn't get jammed
on the horns anymore.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.403
Uh-huh.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.840
You people wonder why I wake up
screaming all the time.

01:41.927 --> 01:44.539
LOIS: Dig in everybody!

01:47.063 --> 01:49.065
What kind of meat is that?

01:49.152 --> 01:49.935
Don't knock it.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.372
This is the stuff

01:51.459 --> 01:53.287
that keeps the cow
from falling apart.

01:55.245 --> 01:57.334
So, Malcolm, you have
any exciting plans

01:57.421 --> 01:59.206
for when you're grounded
this weekend?

01:59.293 --> 02:01.338
You gonna alphabetize
all the stuff in your closet?

02:01.425 --> 02:02.948
Or you can update

02:03.035 --> 02:04.254
all those exciting
new countries onto your globe.

02:05.603 --> 02:08.389
Hey. You could finally
give the corns on your feet

02:08.476 --> 02:09.781
the attention they deserve.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.305
It's bad enough
you're punishing me.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.350
You don't have to mock me
while I'm so miserable.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.918
I am so happy.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.572
I'm sneaking out to a
concert Friday night

02:17.659 --> 02:19.095
while Mom works
the late shift.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.053
The band sucks, but I
have backstage passes.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.968
And if that's even
one-billionth as insane

02:23.055 --> 02:25.406
as I've always imagined
it, I can die happy.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.756
Well, whew.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.888
[ chuckles]
I couldn't eat another bite.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.716
The pay channels
seem to be

02:31.803 --> 02:33.892
on an unusually low
scramble tonight,

02:33.979 --> 02:35.155
so if you'll
all excuse me.

02:37.592 --> 02:38.462
Dad?

02:40.116 --> 02:41.857
What's this?

02:41.944 --> 02:44.773
"This coupon entitles you to
one free game night with Dad."

02:44.860 --> 02:46.383
Let's go.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.603
Dewey, I wrote this in
a blind panic in the hall closet

02:48.690 --> 02:51.519
while everyone was singing you
"Happy Birthday."

02:51.606 --> 02:53.695
You're not gonna
hold me to this, are you?

02:55.697 --> 02:56.828
-Does it have
an expiration date?
-No.

02:56.915 --> 02:59.004
Listen, I'll tell you what.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.268
In exchange for this,
I'll give you two coupons

03:01.355 --> 03:02.443
good for future services.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.229
What kind of pack rat are you?

03:06.316 --> 03:08.231
Don't you ever
throw anything away?

03:09.363 --> 03:11.191
All right, fine!
Let's go.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.280
And I'll start burning
through some of these free hugs.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.456
I don't need them
hanging over my head.

03:48.837 --> 03:52.362
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can't sell you that box.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.624
It's damaged.

03:53.711 --> 03:54.930
I don't see any damage.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.502
Thank you for choosing
Lucky Aide.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.808
Craig, I need you to cover
my Friday night shift.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.854
There's a Lifetime movie
I want to see.

04:05.941 --> 04:09.205
Heather Locklear is a welfare
mom trying to get her kids back.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.685
-Friday?
-I wouldn't want you

04:10.772 --> 04:12.077
to miss that, Lois.

04:12.164 --> 04:13.296
I cried my eyes out

04:13.383 --> 04:14.341
-at the part where...
-Shh!

04:14.428 --> 04:15.516
Right. We'll talk later.

04:16.733 --> 04:19.259
Craig, how could you let her
do that to you?

04:19.346 --> 04:21.173
I would have totally
spilled the romance

04:21.261 --> 04:22.871
with the hunky social worker.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.047
No. Why do you let her
push you around like that?

04:25.134 --> 04:26.831
She didn't even ask.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.180
She just assumed that
you'd have nothing better to do

04:28.268 --> 04:29.747
than to pick up
her crappy shifts.

04:29.834 --> 04:30.748
That's not right.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.576
She does this all the time.

04:32.663 --> 04:33.925
She takes advantage of you

04:34.012 --> 04:35.492
without any consideration
of your feelings.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.798
Doesn't that upset you?

04:36.885 --> 04:38.843
I guess I am
a little cheesed off.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.367
There you go.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.890
I knew you were
too much of a man to let her

04:41.977 --> 04:43.370
get away with this.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.980
You're gonna show her
that Craig Feldspar

04:45.067 --> 04:46.416
can't be pushed around.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.462
Thank you, Malcolm,
for opening my eyes.

04:48.549 --> 04:51.943
You've awoken a sleeping giant,
and he's very cranky.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.775
DEWEY: Six, seven...

04:57.862 --> 04:59.690
Eight, nine, ten.

04:59.777 --> 05:01.736
I win.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.520
Wow, I smoked you again, Dad.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.957
Looks like I'm just
better at Life than you.

05:06.044 --> 05:07.307
Good for you, Dewey.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.569
But I hope you know
that this isn't

05:08.656 --> 05:10.353
how things work
in the real world.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.399
It's very oversimplified.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.402
I mean, you can't just
break into a zoo,

05:15.489 --> 05:16.794
roll a couple of elevens

05:16.881 --> 05:19.014
and suddenly become
the dean of a university.

05:19.101 --> 05:19.971
I did.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.365
Son, I'm just trying

05:22.452 --> 05:24.236
to give you a life lesson here.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.456
And yet, that's my orange limo

05:26.543 --> 05:28.153
sitting at the finish line,
isn't it?

05:28.240 --> 05:29.416
Interesting.

05:33.028 --> 05:36.553
Dewey goes straight to bed
with no dessert.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.729
Interesting.

05:40.862 --> 05:44.561
Here's your seat, Reese--
all warmed up.

05:44.648 --> 05:47.085
-And a low-carb lunch
just like you asked for.
-No, thanks.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.217
I brought my own lunch today.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.656
What?

05:52.743 --> 05:55.398
You can't have blood sausage
without the blood, can you?

05:55.485 --> 05:57.139
You'd better get moving.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.445
I have science
next period,

05:58.532 --> 06:01.491
and those lab stools
are freezing.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.102
Is it okay if I sit here?

06:04.189 --> 06:07.802
This is on a dare, huh?

06:07.889 --> 06:09.804
If you have to touch me,
I'm okay with that,

06:09.891 --> 06:11.414
but I have to approve
any photographs.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.373
No, it's just that I couldn't
sit and watch kids

06:13.460 --> 06:15.331
eating the flesh
of murdered animals.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.811
Is that the special?

06:16.898 --> 06:18.465
Is that why you're
sitting alone?

06:18.552 --> 06:20.554
Are you a vegetarian, too?

06:20.641 --> 06:23.034
Yes, I am.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.559
The very thought of
eating meat

06:25.646 --> 06:27.082
makes my taste buds
cry in disgust.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.390
I just thought
I was the only one.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.043
You're not alone.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.439
[ chuckles]

06:36.526 --> 06:38.746
-Hi. How are you doing?
-Hi, how are you?

06:38.833 --> 06:40.748
So, Craig, did you
tell my mom

06:40.835 --> 06:42.706
that you couldn't cover
her shift Friday night?

06:42.793 --> 06:44.665
Oh, I think I did
far better than that.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.797
-Huh?
-Patience, my friend.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.409
My trap is about to spring.

06:49.496 --> 06:52.716
This stupid pen doesn't work.

06:52.803 --> 06:56.067
I was up all night
scribbling with it.

06:56.154 --> 07:00.028
Watch her face as her whole
world comes crumbling down.

07:02.813 --> 07:05.860
Okay, I didn't see that coming.
But who would?

07:05.947 --> 07:09.167
That's it? That's what you
did to get back at her?

07:09.254 --> 07:11.866
Relax, Malcolm.
That is just the first course

07:11.953 --> 07:15.304
in my tasty menu
of revenge.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.003
That was supposed to stick.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.483
Don't worry--

07:20.570 --> 07:23.443
her finger sponge is
as dry as a bone.

07:23.530 --> 07:27.577
[ evil cackle]

07:27.664 --> 07:28.926
Dad?

07:29.013 --> 07:30.362
What's going on?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.755
I got your message at school.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.975
Is everything okay?

07:34.062 --> 07:35.629
Everything's about to be.

07:35.716 --> 07:36.673
Have a seat.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.852
You pulled me out
of a math test

07:41.939 --> 07:43.637
to play a game with you?

07:43.724 --> 07:46.074
This is much more important
than some useless math test.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.989
I have to make sure
that you understand

07:48.076 --> 07:49.773
you got lucky last time.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.906
Life won't always go
your way, Dewey.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.864
And the sooner you learn
that lesson, the better.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.387
Sit down.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.519
Sit.

07:58.303 --> 08:01.785
"You study hard
and become an astronaut."

08:01.872 --> 08:03.395
All right.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.267
Wha... ?!

08:05.354 --> 08:08.749
What... what kind of lesson

08:08.836 --> 08:11.099
is this stupid game
teaching you?!

08:11.186 --> 08:13.057
Where's the card that tells you

08:13.144 --> 08:15.451
your hemorrhoids are not covered
by your health plan, huh?!

08:15.538 --> 08:17.192
Or would that not make
a fun game?

08:21.849 --> 08:25.200
Hey, Malcolm. Did you know that
henna parties were so last year?

08:25.287 --> 08:26.941
I had no clue.

08:27.028 --> 08:28.595
Craig, I just checked the
schedule and it still says

08:28.682 --> 08:30.248
that you're covering for my mom
Friday night.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.467
I thought you were going
to do something about that.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.600
Oh, I think she
suffered enough.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.951
Her name tag's been on
upside down all night.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.735
Craig, don't you want
to be taken seriously?

08:38.822 --> 08:40.520
I'm taken seriously.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.695
No, you're not.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.479
Especially
not by my mom.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.046
She has nothing but complete
and utter contempt for you.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.613
That's not true.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.484
Oh, yeah?

08:48.571 --> 08:50.094
She said the only reason she
ever makes eye contact with you

08:50.181 --> 08:51.879
is because the rest of you is
too hard to look at.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.837
She did?

08:53.924 --> 08:56.144
And you think she doesn't know
that her name tag's upside down?

08:56.231 --> 08:58.581
Of course she does,
she just doesn't care,

08:58.668 --> 09:00.409
because it was only
Craig the doormat who did it.

09:00.496 --> 09:01.932
You mean
nothing to her.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.804
Nothing at all.
You have to stand up to her.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.546
For once in your life,
Craig, be a man!

09:06.633 --> 09:08.286
I hate her!

09:08.373 --> 09:09.766
[ sobbing]

09:12.552 --> 09:15.380
Okay, so I lied
and destroyed a man

09:15.467 --> 09:17.034
so I could go to a concert.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.994
I'll get him a T-shirt.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.435
There.

09:26.522 --> 09:29.046
I've just got to remember
third, fourth and ninth leaves

09:29.133 --> 09:30.700
and every other tomato.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.136
I don't understand why you can't
just eat vegetarian

09:32.223 --> 09:34.008
for one meal.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.053
You know I get my headaches
if I go too long without meat.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.230
And you don't see lying
to Carrie as a problem?

09:39.317 --> 09:40.884
Come on, Dewey, tell me
how this is any different

09:40.971 --> 09:42.886
than her wearing makeup?

09:42.973 --> 09:45.541
It's not about me--
it's about her fantasy of me.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.674
And I owe it to her
to live up to that fantasy.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.676
Now hand me that stapler.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.250
This is amazing.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.992
Isn't it great finding someone
with the same values?

10:02.079 --> 10:03.428
Exactly.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.213
We couldn't be more on
the same page.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.353
Hey, give me back my hat!

10:15.440 --> 10:16.833
You want your hat back,
come and get it.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.929
Hey, look at
those gorgeous dogs.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.105
Who gives a crap?

10:28.192 --> 10:29.977
I mean, except us.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.369
When is America going
to finally realize

10:31.456 --> 10:32.457
that dogs are not
our enemy?

10:32.544 --> 10:33.502
[ gasps]

10:35.547 --> 10:37.506
Wow, they really love you.

10:37.593 --> 10:40.335
Yeah. This happens
all the time.

10:40.422 --> 10:42.772
I guess they can smell how
much I really love animals.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.079
Get out of here,
you mangy bastards!

10:48.299 --> 10:49.257
[ gasps]

10:49.344 --> 10:50.606
What? What's wrong, Reese?

10:50.693 --> 10:53.391
Hey, you know what I realize?

10:53.478 --> 10:54.697
That is not my hat.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.438
What are you talking about?

10:56.525 --> 10:58.658
Some crazy guy just shoved it
on my head and took off.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.964
I have no idea
what's inside of it!

11:02.183 --> 11:04.185
Oh, my God, is this bacon?!

11:04.272 --> 11:05.969
That's not mine, I swear!

11:06.056 --> 11:07.188
I've been set up!

11:07.275 --> 11:09.538
And that is not
my pork chop!

11:09.625 --> 11:13.847
Oh, my God, the conspiracy
goes all the way to the top!

11:28.775 --> 11:30.037
What are you doing?

11:30.124 --> 11:31.603
Trying to instill in Dewey
the values

11:31.691 --> 11:33.910
sadly neglected
by Mr. Milton Bradley

11:33.997 --> 11:35.956
and those cowardly
Parker Brothers.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.914
I mean, how are kids supposed
to learn about how

11:38.001 --> 11:39.220
life reallyworks?

11:39.307 --> 11:41.831
Not from that G-rated
fairy tale.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.094
You can't just play
a "Join The Circus" card

11:44.181 --> 11:45.574
and walk away scot-free.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.228
"Found A Tumor?"

11:47.315 --> 11:50.231
That takes you
to the Chemo spinner.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.623
Oh, come on, Carrie,

11:51.711 --> 11:53.321
you've got to get over
this vegetarian hang-up.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.975
You can't honestly tell me
those animals were innocent.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.498
They were sent to the
slaughterhouse for a reason.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.195
And if you don't think
they're planning

11:58.282 --> 12:00.807
some kind of uprising,
you're just deluding yourself.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.286
Hello?

12:03.940 --> 12:06.073
She didn't have an answer
to that one, did she?

12:07.465 --> 12:08.815
Malcolm,

12:08.902 --> 12:11.078
do you know what's
going on with Craig?

12:11.165 --> 12:12.383
No. Why?

12:12.470 --> 12:14.385
He left this
bizarre weepy message

12:14.472 --> 12:16.431
on the answering machine.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.738
I mean, it's more bizarre
and weepy than usual.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.130
Did something upset him
at work?

12:20.217 --> 12:22.263
Oh, right.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.699
I think they switched

12:23.786 --> 12:25.005
from cylindrical-shape
ice cream scoopers

12:25.092 --> 12:26.136
to the conical ones.

12:26.223 --> 12:29.139
He took it really hard.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.229
I'm going out to play.

12:32.316 --> 12:36.581
Oh, sorry, son, but you are
staying in to play.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.202
-That's him!
-He's the murderer!

12:48.289 --> 12:50.117
What?! No!

12:50.204 --> 12:52.075
He ate my husband!

12:52.162 --> 12:54.164
He deep-fried my parents!

12:54.251 --> 12:55.035
Order!

12:55.122 --> 12:56.906
Order in the court.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.126
Let's behave like animals,
people.

12:59.213 --> 13:02.346
Your Honor, the defendant
is charged with 63,428

13:02.433 --> 13:04.000
counts of murder!

13:04.087 --> 13:05.001
What?!

13:05.088 --> 13:07.047
Each count is by the slice!

13:07.134 --> 13:09.223
It's not my fault
you're all so delicious!

13:09.310 --> 13:12.182
This isn't fair.
Say something.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.881
[ clucking]

13:14.968 --> 13:17.361
That's not what you said
in the hallway.

13:17.448 --> 13:20.712
I didn't do anything wrong!

13:20.800 --> 13:21.975
Didn't do anything wrong?

13:22.062 --> 13:23.019
Your Honor,

13:23.106 --> 13:24.020
I'd like to present

13:24.107 --> 13:25.717
some evidence.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.894
I warn you, these photographs
are extremely graphic.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.857
What? That's just my breakfast.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.693
Is anybody else getting hungry?

13:44.780 --> 13:46.869
Your Honor, the defendant
obviously shows

13:46.956 --> 13:48.653
no remorse for his crimes.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.003
I've heard enough.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.266
You make me sick
to my stomachs.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.007
I say he's guilty.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.835
How does the jury find?

13:55.922 --> 13:57.793
[ all bleating]:
Guilty!

13:57.880 --> 13:59.186
That's not fair.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.014
They're just following you
like sheep.

14:01.101 --> 14:04.800
You have been found guilty
by a jury of your food.

14:04.887 --> 14:08.717
I sentence you to be lightly
seared and served

14:08.804 --> 14:11.546
with a Cajun peppercorn sauce.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.856
[ screams]

14:32.001 --> 14:33.437
Well, Dewey,
looks like you pulled

14:33.524 --> 14:36.223
another "Debilitating
Depression" card.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.182
Back to the lockdown ward
for you, my friend.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.054
Dad, we've been playing
all night.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.707
Can't we stop?

14:42.794 --> 14:45.710
That is exactly what
I'm trying to teach you, son.

14:45.797 --> 14:49.062
You can't just quit
when things get tough.

14:49.149 --> 14:53.240
You have to grind it out
day after day after day

14:53.327 --> 14:57.548
to feed your kids,
to pay your mortgage.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.768
That's how real life works.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.553
Unless, of course,
you pull the "Suicide" card.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.774
But there's very few
of those in the deck.

15:05.861 --> 15:08.342
My turn.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.214
Oh, morning, Reese.

15:11.301 --> 15:12.999
I'm making sausage for
breakfast, your favorite.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.957
No way!
You can't pin that on me!

15:15.044 --> 15:15.871
I'm innocent!

15:15.958 --> 15:17.917
I'm innocent, you hear!

15:21.659 --> 15:23.139
Craig, what are you doing here?

15:23.226 --> 15:26.099
Just stopped in
to say my good-byes.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.188
Good-bye?

15:28.275 --> 15:29.711
Yup, quit my job
at Lucky Aide,

15:29.798 --> 15:30.973
bought a little
secondhand Vesper

15:31.060 --> 15:32.844
and I'm about
to hit the road.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.324
-What?
-That's right.

15:34.411 --> 15:36.065
I'm going to finally
fulfill my dream

15:36.152 --> 15:38.981
of eating a Swedish pancake
in every IHOP in America.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.504
It's only been done twice,

15:40.591 --> 15:42.289
you know, and one of those
was undocumented.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.378
Craig, that's crazy.
Why are you doing this?

15:44.465 --> 15:46.119
Oh, you know,
it's the same old story.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.034
Girlfriend crowding me,

15:48.121 --> 15:50.297
too many friends
jockeying for face time.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.951
A man needs
his freedom, Lois.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.169
What more can I say?

15:53.256 --> 15:54.649
Anyways, I won't be able

15:54.736 --> 15:55.824
to cover your Friday
night shift after all.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.566
I know this is all my fault,

15:58.653 --> 16:00.263
but maybe this will be good
for him.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.526
He's made a realistic decision
to evaluate his life.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.919
How can that be bad?

16:04.006 --> 16:06.574
I don't have much money,
but I've got my banjo.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.358
I figure I'd pay
for my meals with songs,

16:08.445 --> 16:10.621
the kindness of strangers
should take care of the rest.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.060
Well, then I guess
it's good-bye.

16:14.147 --> 16:16.410
You know I've never been really
big on the sissy stuff,

16:16.497 --> 16:17.802
so I'd better
just haul tush.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.591
Wow.

16:23.678 --> 16:27.377
I wasn't going to say anything
until he got to the banjo stuff,

16:27.464 --> 16:29.945
but he'll be dead
before sundown.

16:30.032 --> 16:33.209
Mom, I think there's
something you should know.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.950
Remember last week when
you asked Craig to cover for you

16:35.037 --> 16:36.647
on the schedule--

16:36.734 --> 16:39.259
You ruined his life
so you could go see some band?!

16:39.346 --> 16:41.435
Are you that selfish?

16:41.522 --> 16:43.306
Apparently, because
there's a part of me hoping

16:43.393 --> 16:44.481
you'll still let me go.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.007
Okay, that part's gone.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.183
Get in the car!
We got to go find him!

16:54.926 --> 16:57.059
Reese, I still don't understand
what we're doing here.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.756
I've worked here
all this time

16:58.843 --> 17:00.193
and I didn't understand.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.542
Understand what?

17:01.629 --> 17:03.587
That this is a crime
against nature.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.546
Would you like to be slathered
in a delicious sauce

17:05.633 --> 17:06.851
and charbroiled
to order?

17:06.938 --> 17:08.549
I don't think so.

17:10.898 --> 17:13.380
Woah, wait up!

17:21.127 --> 17:22.998
You're free!
You're all free!

17:23.085 --> 17:24.739
Go and live
your lives!

17:32.834 --> 17:34.227
Earn this.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.188
You're a hero, Reese!

17:39.275 --> 17:40.494
Look at them run!

17:40.581 --> 17:42.235
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

17:42.322 --> 17:46.891
I mean, besides the flies
and crap and stuff.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.241
Oh, my God!

17:48.328 --> 17:50.460
They're heading
onto the freeway!

17:50.547 --> 17:53.115
This is it, the open road.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.336
A great new chapter's
about to be written,

17:56.423 --> 17:59.643
a new legend about to be born.

17:59.730 --> 18:04.083
Will I travel from town to town
solving crimes like Knightrider,

18:04.170 --> 18:07.608
or administer frontier justice
like the guy from Kung Fu?

18:07.695 --> 18:10.176
I guess we'll just have to see.

18:10.263 --> 18:13.309
[ dog barks in distance]

18:13.396 --> 18:18.488
Okay, America, get ready
to meet Craig Feldspar.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.708
Craig, wait!

18:24.625 --> 18:26.975
[ screams]

18:27.062 --> 18:29.282
Oh, God!

18:33.024 --> 18:34.852
Craig, are you
all right?!

18:34.939 --> 18:36.289
Craig! Craig!

18:36.376 --> 18:37.899
Kit, is that you?

18:39.640 --> 18:41.468
[ coughs]

18:41.555 --> 18:43.296
Just help me back on my hog.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.340
I'll be fine.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.561
Thanks. I'm good to go.

18:47.648 --> 18:48.866
Oh, Craig, don't be ridiculous.

18:48.953 --> 18:49.998
You're not going anywhere.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.826
Why? Do you need somebody

18:51.913 --> 18:54.089
to paint your lawn
or mow your house?

18:54.176 --> 18:56.483
Look, Craig, Malcolm
told me about that.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.485
I admit I take you
for granted sometimes,

18:58.572 --> 18:59.790
I apologize for that,

18:59.877 --> 19:01.009
but we can talk about
that later.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.489
You have to come back.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.012
I can't.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.536
Why? Craig, come on.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.886
Aren't you interested at all
to see how my mom punishes me?

19:08.973 --> 19:11.411
-No.
-Why not?

19:11.498 --> 19:14.979
Because for the last 12 years,
I've dedicated my life

19:15.066 --> 19:16.938
to a relationship
that can't exist.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.115
I can't go back to that.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.465
Craig, what do you want
from me?!

19:22.552 --> 19:25.033
I want more!

19:25.120 --> 19:27.035
I'm sorry.
I can't give you more.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.210
You know that.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.820
There's got to be
something.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.953
There's got to be
some scenario

19:32.040 --> 19:34.608
where you could
see us together. Please?!

19:34.695 --> 19:35.870
Anything!

19:42.790 --> 19:46.533
Okay, this is the only universe
this could possibly exist in.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.364
I'm 90 years old.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.887
Hal is dead.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.454
I have dementia and I need
someone to keep me

19:54.541 --> 19:55.716
from catching myself on fire.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.457
There's no money
for a nurse,

19:57.544 --> 20:01.112
the kids won't do it,
and I'm asleep 22 hours a day.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.987
Then and only then maybe
could we be together.

20:09.469 --> 20:12.907
It's like you're reading
straight out of my diary.

20:19.174 --> 20:22.090
Six, seven, eight.

20:25.572 --> 20:26.834
I win!

20:29.010 --> 20:31.882
Oh, wow.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.190
I got to tell you, Dad,

20:35.277 --> 20:37.148
I really thought
this was just going to be

20:37.236 --> 20:39.499
another one of your stupid,
useless lessons

20:39.586 --> 20:40.935
like the time you made us nurse

20:41.022 --> 20:42.458
that rabid squirrel back
to health.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.331
But this one really worked.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.681
I can't believe it,

20:47.768 --> 20:50.640
but I really learned some
valuable things about life

20:50.727 --> 20:53.600
and about how the world
really works.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.646
Thank you.

20:58.431 --> 21:01.695
That's loser talk!

21:01.782 --> 21:03.000
What?

21:03.087 --> 21:04.785
I am living in
Successful Estates

21:04.872 --> 21:08.789
while you are being buried
in a piano box!

21:10.921 --> 21:12.227
In your face,
drug addict!

21:12.314 --> 21:14.621
Hotcha! I won!

21:14.708 --> 21:16.362
I won! Oh, yes, indeed,
I won!

21:16.449 --> 21:17.972
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

21:18.059 --> 21:19.016
I won, I won, I won!
