00:31.921 --> 00:34.110
Well date night was a rousing success.

00:34.111 --> 00:36.824
Me and my lady, eating steaks, drinking martinis,

00:36.825 --> 00:39.143
and I'm not too drunk or too full for sex.

00:39.144 --> 00:40.519
Too bad it's not sex night.

00:40.520 --> 00:44.023
Stan, every Friday night,we go to the same restaurant

00:44.024 --> 00:46.038
and get the same steak dinner.

00:46.039 --> 00:47.467
I feel like we're in a rut.

00:47.468 --> 00:51.226
A good rut like 200 years of decracy or a bad rut like UNICEF?

00:51.227 --> 00:54.245
A rut with nothing exciting in it.

00:59.298 --> 01:01.339
He's challenging us.

01:01.340 --> 01:04.257
Oh, Stan, are you gonna do  what I hope you're gonna do?

01:04.259 --> 01:05.471
You bet I am.

01:05.471 --> 01:08.193
This punk doesn't stand a chance.

01:15.144 --> 01:16.148
What are you doing?

01:16.149 --> 01:17.410
Writing down his license plate

01:17.411 --> 01:20.048
so I can report him to the proper authorities for speeding...

01:20.049 --> 01:21.635
and for wastefully burning rubber.

01:21.636 --> 01:23.426
There's a war on Francine.

01:23.427 --> 01:25.584
And it's going great.

01:28.215 --> 01:30.121
Okay, babe, the show's about to start.

01:30.122 --> 01:31.317
Let's get ready.

01:31.318 --> 01:32.160
What are you doing?

01:32.161 --> 01:34.620
It's my half of our favorite TV cuddle position.

01:34.621 --> 01:36.502
How about we just sit and watch?

01:36.503 --> 01:38.017
You have the best ideas.

01:38.018 --> 01:42.888
I'm gonna write that down in
my Journal of Amazing Things Hayley Said, Volume 3.

01:42.889 --> 01:43.989
I'm going to the kitchen.

01:43.990 --> 01:47.478
Cool. I'm gonna decorate
this page with glitter.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.368
-- Hello.
-- Hey, babe.

01:51.369 --> 01:53.686
I missed you so much,I wrote a song for you.

01:53.687 --> 01:55.009
-- I'm dumping you.
-- What?!

01:55.100 --> 01:58.553
You're clingy, and you're smothering me and it's over.

01:58.554 --> 02:00.398
I can't believe you're doing this over the phone.

02:00.399 --> 02:01.554
Good-bye, Jeff.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.603
Hayley, wait!

02:03.604 --> 02:05.313
She hung up.

02:08.401 --> 02:09.651
Francine, I've told you,

02:09.651 --> 02:13.560
sandwiches should be cut in triangles like a neatly folded flag.

02:13.561 --> 02:16.228
What am I supposed to do with this rectangular monstrosity?

02:16.229 --> 02:18.729
Can't you just pretend it's an unfolded flag?

02:18.730 --> 02:20.238
No.

02:20.361 --> 02:22.650
God, you can be such a douche.

02:22.651 --> 02:25.292
Agathor!
Agathor!

02:25.293 --> 02:27.251
Oh, crap. Steve's friends.

02:27.252 --> 02:28.375
Into your cupboard.

02:28.376 --> 02:29.827
Oh, good,
now it's my cupboard.

02:29.828 --> 02:31.906
That doesn't make me
feel like a loser.

02:31.907 --> 02:34.833
That was awesome how you
killed that ice giant.

02:34.834 --> 02:36.401
he was vanquished

02:36.402 --> 02:38.358
like your American dollar

02:38.359 --> 02:40.782
Steve, you are the
king of Dragonscuffle.

02:40.783 --> 02:41.807
Peasant!

02:41.875 --> 02:43.292
I am not Steve.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.840
Forgive me, oh, great and powerful Agathor!

02:45.841 --> 02:47.348
As punishment for your insolence,

02:47.349 --> 02:50.515
you must now carry my Backpack of Holding!

02:50.516 --> 02:53.824
And you, Agathor does not choose to use his muscles.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.685
Walk me forward!

02:55.686 --> 02:59.035
Goobalek, work your dwarvish magic on that portal.

03:00.537 --> 03:01.937
What about Little League?

03:01.938 --> 03:04.666
I thought he was going to be in Little League.

03:05.220 --> 03:06.710
Tuluk nuk nuk?

03:06.711 --> 03:08.709
Oh, I'm sorry.I've been locked here so long.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.414
I went all Nell and invented my own language.

03:11.415 --> 03:15.121
What do you think that street racer we saw last night eats for lunch?

03:15.122 --> 03:19.153
I bet he measures his seasonings using a hooker's navel.

03:19.210 --> 03:21.259
What an exciting life!

03:21.260 --> 03:25.869
Well, that was about as obvious as the setup for the sequel at the end of Batman Begins.

03:25.870 --> 03:26.902
What are you talking about?

03:26.903 --> 03:30.514
You know, when Inspector Gordon gives him that Joker playing card.

03:30.515 --> 03:31.847
No. What about Francine?

03:31.848 --> 03:32.638
What about her?

03:32.639 --> 03:35.369
You sounded like you were gonna say something important about Francine.

03:35.370 --> 03:37.203
No. Don't think so.

03:37.204 --> 03:39.354
Oh. Okay.

03:41.463 --> 03:42.747
Oh, I remember.

03:42.748 --> 03:46.838
Francine is fantasizing about the street racer you saw last night.

03:46.839 --> 03:47.927
Why would she do that?

03:47.928 --> 03:48.881
Why would who do what?

03:48.882 --> 03:50.382
Francine! Street racers!

03:50.383 --> 03:51.326
Oh, ri--oh, right.

03:51.327 --> 03:53.553
My mind, my mind's all drifty today.

03:53.554 --> 03:54.847
Uh, anyway, you're boring,

03:54.848 --> 03:56.873
and Francine's stuck on the street racer

03:56.874 --> 03:58.834
because he represents danger and thrills.

03:58.835 --> 04:00.026
That's ridiculous.

04:00.027 --> 04:02.595
Francine doesn't think things that she doesn't say.

04:02.596 --> 04:04.621
She's not a dog.

04:07.241 --> 04:08.618
Please let me play!

04:08.619 --> 04:09.997
I don't think you're ready yet.

04:09.998 --> 04:11.194
Not ready?!

04:11.195 --> 04:13.137
I've been watching you for four years!

04:13.138 --> 04:14.247
Night time.

04:14.258 --> 04:15.438
I'm not a parrot.

04:15.439 --> 04:17.531
That trick won't work on...

04:23.049 --> 04:23.751
Jeff?

04:23.752 --> 04:24.781
I'm sorry, dude,

04:24.782 --> 04:26.962
I just had to be near Hayley

04:26.963 --> 04:28.465
That's her room, right?

04:28.466 --> 04:31.085
I just want to feel close to her again.

04:32.448 --> 04:34.353
Hayley.

04:35.389 --> 04:36.864
Knock yourself out, buddy.

04:36.865 --> 04:38.841
I'll be over here killing goblins.

04:38.842 --> 04:39.941
Excuse me?

04:39.942 --> 04:42.956
I'm playing Dragonscuffle online with my friends.

04:42.957 --> 04:44.660
See? This is Agathor,

04:44.661 --> 04:47.093
my mighty warrior character.

04:48.019 --> 04:49.261
I've spent four years

04:49.262 --> 04:53.433
developing him into the most dangerous fighter in
the entire Kingdom of Krathnor.

04:53.434 --> 04:56.352
Don't you feel like you're kind of missing out on your actual life?

04:56.353 --> 04:59.037
See, the problem is that in the "real world,"

04:59.038 --> 05:00.355
things often suck.

05:00.356 --> 05:01.727
But when I'm Agathor,

05:01.728 --> 05:04.123
there is no pain, no wedgies,

05:04.124 --> 05:07.543
no heartache, only victory.

05:07.544 --> 05:09.591
Wow, I'm really intrigued.

05:09.592 --> 05:13.614
Although that could just be the Intrigue-a-nol I took this morning.

05:17.570 --> 05:18.917
Francine?

05:21.517 --> 05:22.157
Stan!

05:22.158 --> 05:24.628
That's 2 Fast 2 Furious!

05:24.629 --> 05:26.228
Which means you've already seen the first one!

05:26.229 --> 05:29.307
How else could you possibly follow the highly
cerebral storyline?

05:29.308 --> 05:30.167
It's true.

05:30.168 --> 05:31.853
You're bored of me, aren't you?

05:31.854 --> 05:33.751
Um, uh...

05:33.886 --> 05:36.340
This is all just a dream you're having.

05:36.341 --> 05:38.745
I represent your father.

05:38.746 --> 05:41.963
You never lived up to the goals I set for you!

05:42.069 --> 05:45.006
Bad Stan, bad Stan,

05:45.100 --> 05:48.143
bad Stan...!

05:49.467 --> 05:50.633
Roger!

05:50.634 --> 05:51.800
Roger, wake up.

05:51.801 --> 05:53.654
I need you.

05:55.619 --> 05:57.153
Okay, here we go.

05:57.154 --> 05:59.795
I knew it was only a matter of time.

05:59.796 --> 06:07.480
*You know I won't hold you back now... *

06:07.481 --> 06:08.767
You were right.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.646
Francine's hot for that street racer.

06:11.647 --> 06:12.794
Oh.

06:13.137 --> 06:14.834
Awkward.

06:14.835 --> 06:16.453
Okay, look, you big tub of booze,

06:16.454 --> 06:19.354
she doesn't want him, she just wants some excitement.

06:19.355 --> 06:21.279
So what do I do?

06:21.280 --> 06:24.355
Simple: Go find a street racer and challenge him.

06:24.356 --> 06:26.102
That's a great idea.

06:26.103 --> 06:28.852
I'll show Francine I'm not boring!

06:28.853 --> 06:30.106
Now you're talking!

06:30.107 --> 06:32.426
But if you're gonna streetrace,
first thing you got to do

06:32.427 --> 06:34.740
is let me soup up your car a skootch.

06:34.741 --> 06:36.402
What do you know about cars?

06:36.403 --> 06:39.337
Well, I know a muscle car is
any off-the-line street vehicle

06:39.338 --> 06:42.468
with a horsepower to weight
divisor of 18 or above.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.612
Yeah, when you're locked in a Cadillac,

06:44.613 --> 06:45.990
sinking to the bottom of the ocean,

06:45.991 --> 06:48.673
you either learn about cars or you die.

06:51.274 --> 06:53.444
Agathor! Cover me!

06:55.000 --> 07:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:13.619 --> 07:15.016
Dude, what am I doing wrong?

07:15.017 --> 07:17.360
Press "Shift-Control-P"!

07:18.428 --> 07:19.479
Oh, cool.

07:23.578 --> 07:27.205
We're gonna be dead ike my uncle's left hand!

07:27.206 --> 07:28.067
Take heart, men!

07:28.068 --> 07:32.036
They always put in a way to win these games.

07:47.451 --> 07:48.880
All hail...

07:48.881 --> 07:49.876
Agathor!

07:49.877 --> 07:51.382
You were awesome, dude.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.566
Hey, Dork of Ages, have you seen my--

07:53.567 --> 07:55.346
Jeff, what are you
doing here?

07:55.347 --> 07:57.722
I know it must be hard for someone like you

07:57.723 --> 07:59.286
to lose someone like me, but...

07:59.287 --> 08:02.084
Oh, my God! Hell Hounds
are coming out of the lava!

08:02.130 --> 08:02.941
I'm on it.

08:02.942 --> 08:05.020
Uh, Jeff, hello?

08:05.021 --> 08:07.034
Woman you worship talking.

08:08.796 --> 08:10.680
This isn't the way to the steak house.

08:10.681 --> 08:12.163
We're not going to a steakhouse,

08:12.164 --> 08:13.910
but there will be stakes--

08:13.911 --> 08:15.332
high stakes.

08:15.333 --> 08:16.201
What do you mean?

08:16.202 --> 08:17.756
Think about it.

08:18.848 --> 08:20.799
Never mind.We're here.

08:24.552 --> 08:26.109
Where are we?

08:26.110 --> 08:31.176
The corner of Excitement Street
and Unpredictability Avenue.

08:43.432 --> 08:45.645
*************

08:46.753 --> 08:48.022
Ho'dup, ho'dup.

08:48.023 --> 08:51.099
Yo, I heard there's a new badass driver in this mug.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.591
They call him "The Suit."

08:52.592 --> 08:54.742
I tell you something right now, he crazy.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.936
Yo, yo, Suit's in the house.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.602
Oh, hey, girl.Holla atcha boy.

09:01.483 --> 09:03.660
Hey, look,it's The Suit!

09:03.846 --> 09:05.106
So, you're the fabled Suit

09:05.107 --> 09:07.885
I've been hearing about for the past 20 seconds.

09:07.886 --> 09:08.620
Let's race.

09:08.621 --> 09:10.935
You're on,minority person.

09:15.950 --> 09:18.383
Stan, you don't have to
prove anything to me.

09:18.384 --> 09:20.484
This is dangerous!

09:55.170 --> 09:57.088
My God, I did it! I won!

09:57.089 --> 09:59.057
What a rush!

09:59.086 --> 10:00.979
I hope this is sweat.

10:00.980 --> 10:02.110
Where's Francine?

10:02.111 --> 10:04.980
Oh, God, I hope she's not mad at me for...

10:36.377 --> 10:38.137
I was so sick of Jeff,

10:38.138 --> 10:39.853
and now I can't stop thinking about him.

10:39.854 --> 10:43.036
I have to figure out a way to win him back from my stupid brother.

10:43.037 --> 10:44.611
Your brother is not the problem.

10:44.612 --> 10:46.344
The problem is Agathor.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.682
Kill him,and you'll get Jeff back.

10:48.683 --> 10:50.535
Oh, my God,you know how to kill him?

10:50.536 --> 10:52.728
The question isn't can I kill him.

10:52.729 --> 10:55.224
The question is,
"Do you like me?"

10:55.225 --> 10:56.957
-- Not really.
-- Oh.

10:57.121 --> 10:59.550
Anyway, I know how to defeat Steve.

11:03.665 --> 11:05.398
Mighty Agathor,

11:05.399 --> 11:10.040
once again your strong arm has proved the salvation of--

11:10.041 --> 11:11.652
Ugh, it's hard to talk like this.

11:11.653 --> 11:12.705
Dude, you rule.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.988
I do, don't I?

11:13.989 --> 11:16.567
Fladnag, check these bodies for treasure,

11:16.568 --> 11:19.168
and don't forget to look in their weirdly deep orc butts.

11:19.169 --> 11:21.054
Yes, sir.

11:21.067 --> 11:22.099
And, Zamfir?

11:22.100 --> 11:23.264
Yes, Great One?

11:23.265 --> 11:26.232
Give us a lively tune for butt searching.

11:31.410 --> 11:32.852
Halt, fair stranger.

11:32.853 --> 11:34.998
Out of my way, Dork of Ages.

11:34.999 --> 11:35.943
Hayley?

11:35.944 --> 11:38.738
No, I am Morwen Nerdbane.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.597
Here to challenge Agathor to mortal combat.

11:46.695 --> 11:48.040
Klaus, he's gonna kill me.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.894
Say Agathor's name backwards.

11:49.895 --> 11:52.826
I shall strike you down with a single...

11:52.827 --> 11:55.147
"Rohtaga."

11:58.591 --> 11:59.958
That felt good.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.381
And I've almost died from autoerotic asphyxiation,

12:02.382 --> 12:04.250
so I know from good.

12:04.251 --> 12:06.313
Domino, bitch.

12:06.454 --> 12:08.075
Hey, Suit,you're the bomb.

12:08.076 --> 12:09.865
All these other guys got nothing on you.

12:09.866 --> 12:13.771
-- You are the...
-- Second fastest racer on the street.

12:14.730 --> 12:15.846
Oh, it is on.

12:15.847 --> 12:17.807
Somebody hold my rings.

12:17.808 --> 12:19.325
You talk a big game

12:19.326 --> 12:22.933
but what do you say we settle this like adolescents
with very poor judgment?

12:22.934 --> 12:24.876
I'm gonna kick your ass.

12:24.877 --> 12:27.313
Nuh-uh, I'm gonna kick your ass.

12:27.693 --> 12:29.860
I kicked your ass.

12:29.861 --> 12:30.679
I know.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.077
I guess I was wrong about who was going to kick whose ass.

12:33.078 --> 12:34.246
You lost?!

12:34.247 --> 12:35.421
You never lose.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.032
So I lost a little street cred.

12:37.033 --> 12:38.070
I'll get it back.

12:38.071 --> 12:39.175
It's all part of the dance.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.614
Stan, you don't understand.

12:40.615 --> 12:42.092
-- I...
-- Where's my money?

12:42.093 --> 12:44.355
If you're smart,in U.S. Savings Bonds.

12:44.356 --> 12:46.631
Your wife put down 50 on the race.

12:46.632 --> 12:49.412
What?! Francine, why would you bet 50 grand?

12:49.413 --> 12:51.348
I needed more excitement.

12:51.349 --> 12:53.463
I just wanted that extra rush,

12:53.464 --> 12:55.224
to feel that high.

12:55.225 --> 12:56.387
oh,god woman

12:56.388 --> 12:58.977
Couldn't you have just had a Red Bull
and a sugar cookie?

12:58.978 --> 13:00.839
We don't have $50,000.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.196
Well, you have three hours to get it.

13:03.197 --> 13:05.598
Until then,we keep your wife.

13:05.599 --> 13:07.320
Like hell you will.

13:07.785 --> 13:09.179
Stan

13:10.676 --> 13:11.902
Sorry I missed the race.

13:11.903 --> 13:15.689
I *********

13:16.439 --> 13:18.395
I can't belive they took Francine.

13:18.396 --> 13:20.539
How am I gonna get $50,000?

13:20.540 --> 13:21.606
We'll think of something.

13:21.607 --> 13:22.915
Wait. Pull over.

13:23.856 --> 13:27.061
-- What?
-- I kindwant a coconut popsicle.

13:29.546 --> 13:31.070
Drive! Drive! Drive!

13:31.071 --> 13:31.945
What? What's going on?

13:31.946 --> 13:33.773
-- I robbed the place.
-- What?!

13:33.774 --> 13:35.903
I was trying to settle on a pair of sunglasses

13:35.904 --> 13:38.371
when I realized how we could get the money.

13:38.478 --> 13:39.571
"Yes" to these?

13:39.572 --> 13:41.921
Stan, "yes" to these?

13:41.965 --> 13:43.558
Floor it!

13:44.535 --> 13:46.882
********

13:49.956 --> 13:52.049
Jeff, you wanna get some pizza?

13:52.050 --> 13:54.262
You killed Agathor.
How could you do that?

13:54.263 --> 13:56.837
Oh, come on, it was just
a character in a game.

13:56.838 --> 13:58.639
Yeah, but to Steve,
it was everything.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.003
You know, when you dumped
me, I blamed myself.

14:01.004 --> 14:02.836
But after what you did
to your brother...

14:02.837 --> 14:04.147
you're just heartless.

14:04.148 --> 14:06.477
You're bad candy, babe.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.510
And stop enjoying my mural.

14:12.692 --> 14:15.285
So, if my husband can't come up with the money,

14:15.286 --> 14:16.622
what are you gonna do to me?

14:16.623 --> 14:17.711
We're gonna kill you.

14:17.712 --> 14:18.956
Oh, my God.

14:20.299 --> 14:24.376
* Here I go again on my own... *

14:24.377 --> 14:25.647
Shut up!

14:26.972 --> 14:27.941
Peasant.

14:27.942 --> 14:32.934
The Mighty Goobalek desires that you carry all our backpacks to the arcade.

14:32.935 --> 14:34.972
Yes, mighty Goobalek.

14:35.364 --> 14:39.008
And you're not allowed to use the muscles in your legs.

14:42.106 --> 14:44.130
Oh, my God,I destroyed him.

14:44.131 --> 14:45.540
He's not destroyed.

14:45.541 --> 14:50.115
He's just very, very,
very, very... sad.

14:50.410 --> 14:51.543
Okay, I'm going in.

14:51.544 --> 14:52.852
You cover me.

14:54.262 --> 14:55.430
Wait, what am I doing?

14:55.431 --> 14:57.033
I'm a man of the law.

14:57.034 --> 14:59.996
I'm gonna handle this my way.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.516
Shoot 'em!Shoot 'em in the face!

15:05.913 --> 15:08.536
********

15:15.598 --> 15:17.400
Jeff, there's a magical amulet.

15:17.401 --> 15:19.269
I can bring Agathor back to life.

15:19.270 --> 15:21.272
And why would you do that?

15:21.273 --> 15:22.766
I realized you were right.

15:22.767 --> 15:25.872
I should have known how
important Agathor was to Steve.

15:25.873 --> 15:28.596
I want to fix it,
but it's a dangerous journey.

15:28.597 --> 15:30.358
I can't do it without you.

15:30.359 --> 15:32.019
Well, okay,

15:32.020 --> 15:33.581
but we're not getting back together.

15:33.582 --> 15:35.499
This isn't a make-up quest.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.564
Absolutely.
All business.

15:38.168 --> 15:39.185
No hugs.

15:39.186 --> 15:41.321
It was a business hug,
but okay,

15:41.322 --> 15:44.202
you're the goat...
man... thingy.

16:15.030 --> 16:17.637
This is it. The Amulet of Resurrection is in there.

16:17.638 --> 16:19.348
We made it.

16:22.061 --> 16:24.100
The Castle Roodpart.

16:24.101 --> 16:25.539
Who comes up with these names?

16:25.540 --> 16:26.602
In this world,

16:26.603 --> 16:29.993
"Roodpart" is probably some ancient mystic word with...

16:29.994 --> 16:32.850
Oh, crap. It's "trapdoor"spelled backwards.

16:34.582 --> 16:36.378
Oh, there's my penis!

16:40.365 --> 16:41.502
All right,

16:41.503 --> 16:42.809
there they are.

16:42.810 --> 16:43.992
Oh, them you can see,

16:43.993 --> 16:46.505
but me getting my ass kicked--off the radar.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.399
Look, your plan
was never gonna work.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.967
I'm gonna handle this my way.

16:51.728 --> 16:52.503
You got the money?

16:52.504 --> 16:54.905
You got the manners to say hello first?

16:54.906 --> 16:55.584
Hello.

16:55.585 --> 16:58.105
I got your money,
let's do this.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.222
Phonebooks?
What the hell is this?

17:02.360 --> 17:04.759
See, uh...
Ah! I opened it upside down.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.684
The money's supposed to be on the top of the phonebooks--

17:06.685 --> 17:08.323
Run, Francine!

17:08.512 --> 17:10.771
Can't a brotha get a "Run, Roger"?

17:10.771 --> 17:13.990
Damn. Gotta be all self-runnin'
and whatnot.

17:22.211 --> 17:23.287
They're catching up.

17:23.288 --> 17:24.736
Roger, we need more speed.

17:24.737 --> 17:27.080
I gotta lighten this sucker up.

17:43.764 --> 17:45.649
Is there anything else
we can lose?

17:45.650 --> 17:46.869
No, nothing.

17:46.870 --> 17:47.804
What are those?

17:47.805 --> 17:49.566
My Rod Stewart albums.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.432
-- Lose 'em.
-- Duck!

17:58.505 --> 17:59.400
I made it.

17:59.401 --> 18:00.661
Aw, the hell with it.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.069
Choke on my Rod.

18:16.349 --> 18:17.840
Look,there's the amulet.

18:17.841 --> 18:20.723
Aw,he's adorable.

18:39.196 --> 18:40.629
We are so screwed.

18:40.630 --> 18:41.329
No, wait.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.732
They always put in some way to win these games.

18:43.733 --> 18:46.144
Why is there a scuba tank on the wall?

18:47.112 --> 18:47.921
Of course.

18:47.922 --> 18:49.837
Grab your bow.

19:01.545 --> 19:03.309
Smile, you son of a...

19:11.840 --> 19:13.939
Dude! That was awesome!

19:13.940 --> 19:16.314
Thanks.
The Amulet.

19:17.227 --> 19:18.239
What do we do with it?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.398
It's a suppository.

19:19.399 --> 19:20.609
Not it.

19:29.521 --> 19:32.197
It's... impossible.

19:32.198 --> 19:34.122
I'm alive!

19:34.123 --> 19:36.473
All hail the mighty Agathor.

19:36.474 --> 19:38.202
Thank you,young warrior.

19:38.203 --> 19:40.749
And now with haste and grim dignity,

19:40.750 --> 19:45.123
I go to remove the amulet from betwixt my cheeks.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.486
You know, we make a great team.

19:48.487 --> 19:50.764
I guess I could give us
another chance after all.

19:50.765 --> 19:51.836
Actually,

19:51.837 --> 19:54.348
I kind of met someone.

19:59.841 --> 20:00.916
How's it goin'?

20:00.917 --> 20:03.134
What? When did you meet him?

20:03.135 --> 20:06.554
Remember that tavern,
and you went to the bathroom?

20:06.555 --> 20:08.399
It just kind of happened.

20:12.703 --> 20:14.852
Boy, that-that
was exciting, huh?

20:14.853 --> 20:16.135
Now listen,
if you want to keep racing,

20:16.136 --> 20:18.190
we'll-we'll build a new car.

20:18.191 --> 20:20.052
A better, faster car.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.202
No, Stan.

20:21.203 --> 20:23.283
I don't think I needed all this.

20:23.284 --> 20:24.939
You... you didn't?

20:24.940 --> 20:26.083
No.

20:26.084 --> 20:27.909
I wanted to mix up
our routine,

20:27.910 --> 20:29.606
but this was too much.

20:29.607 --> 20:31.616
I'd love to find something in between

20:31.617 --> 20:33.929
going to the same restaurant every Friday

20:33.930 --> 20:37.128
and being kidnapped by heavily armed skinheads.

20:37.129 --> 20:38.626
Something like,

20:38.627 --> 20:39.513
I don't know,

20:39.514 --> 20:42.391
going dancing or sailing, or...

20:42.392 --> 20:43.554
Having sex in the road?

20:43.555 --> 20:45.402
Or having sex in the road.

20:45.403 --> 20:46.756
See, that's perfect.

20:46.757 --> 20:48.111
Why couldn't we do that?

20:48.112 --> 20:49.670
We can. We can totally do that.

20:49.671 --> 20:50.831
Let's do it right now.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.504
I don't even think I have to take these shorts off.

20:53.505 --> 20:55.327
Well let's find out.

21:00.721 --> 21:02.871
Hey, guys. Miss me?

21:03.738 --> 21:06.265
Now you shall learn the meaning of...

21:06.266 --> 21:08.232
"Rohtaga."

21:08.974 --> 21:10.797
son of bitch
