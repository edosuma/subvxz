WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.703
Anybody else moves,
they're dead.

00:02.736 --> 00:04.172
You, fill it up,
just the bills.

00:04.205 --> 00:07.175
CHRIS ROCK:
When I was growing up,
crime was always on the move.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.477
The rest of you tellers
move away from those windows.

00:09.510 --> 00:14.082
It went from crime on TV
to crime in the city...

00:14.115 --> 00:15.216
to crime in our house.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.250
So what's missing?

00:16.284 --> 00:17.451
The television.

00:17.485 --> 00:20.421
To my parents and the police,
the house got robbed...

00:20.454 --> 00:21.822
To Drew and Tonya,

00:21.855 --> 00:22.990
the TV got kidnapped.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.393
Here, I sketched something
for you to give to the FBI.

00:25.426 --> 00:29.463
It was a 19-inch RCA,
serial number 1993IH.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.299
Do you think
you can get it back?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.367
We'll try. What else?

00:33.401 --> 00:35.536
Well, we're still trying
to figure it out,

00:35.569 --> 00:38.206
but they took the stereo,
all of our records

00:38.239 --> 00:41.442
including my autographed
James Brown The Payback album.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.743
Ooh, that's
a collector's item.

00:42.776 --> 00:43.744
It's worth some money.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.379
They took my meat!
What?

00:45.413 --> 00:48.316
All of it. Steaks,
hamburgers, hot dogs,

00:48.349 --> 00:49.517
bologna.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.085
If they had stole
that stuff earlier

00:51.119 --> 00:52.353
maybe he wouldn't have
the gout.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.621
Can you find out who did this?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.756
Doubtful.
There's a lot of crime.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.292
Aren't you going to dust
the place for fingerprints,

00:58.326 --> 01:00.394
you know, canvas the
neighborhood for witnesses,

01:00.428 --> 01:01.629
check with your snitches,

01:01.662 --> 01:03.431
put your ears to the street,
something?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.666
Lady, my shift ends
in six minutes.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.701
Fill out this report.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.403
And that's it?
That's it.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.704
So you're not going
to help us at all?

01:10.738 --> 01:12.740
No, but we're here
to comfort you.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.708
Forget this.
I'm getting a gun.

01:14.742 --> 01:18.679
Julius, do you know what
would happen if we got a gun?

01:18.712 --> 01:21.182
Who ate the big piece
of chicken?

01:22.750 --> 01:25.286
You

01:28.389 --> 01:31.459
Who left the damn
toilet seat up

01:33.494 --> 01:36.230
Who ate all the cereal?

01:38.332 --> 01:41.435
I will blow
your freakin' head off!

01:41.469 --> 01:43.437
I think we should get a dog.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.705
I'd always wanted a dog.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.440
My parents always said no.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.742
But maybe the robbery would
make them change their mind.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.912
For the umpteenth time, Chris,
we are not getting a dog.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.382
Wishful thinking.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.617
The kid's right. If you really
want to protect the house,

01:56.650 --> 01:58.486
a guard dog
is the best way to go.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.525
I don't think
he likes you, Dad.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.526
He better like me.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.429
I paid $35 to have him
vaccinated and neutered.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.930
Now we know why he's growling.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.732
Can we name him?

02:11.765 --> 02:13.301
He already has a name.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.236
Blackie.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.504
But he's brown.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.639
You black and you brown.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.308
Well, I want to give
him a bath.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.510
Hey, hey, hey,
not so fast.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.379
This dog needs to be trained
to protect this house.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.447
And since it was
Chris' idea,

02:26.480 --> 02:29.650
it's his responsibility
to feed him, bathe him,

02:29.683 --> 02:32.620
walk him and clean
up his mess.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.555
She always said
she ain't raising no babies.

CHRIS ROCK:
Getting my first dog

03:10.658 --> 03:12.626
was like getting
a whole new lease on life.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.329
I guess you could say it was
like having a new friend.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.364
Hey, li'l dude,

03:16.397 --> 03:18.232
let me hold a dollar.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.504
Thanks.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.673
Go get my dollar.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.647
A friend with benefits.

03:33.681 --> 03:34.882
Yeah.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.485
Training Blackie was going
to be fun.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.819
I figured I'd start
with the basics.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.722
Come here. Come here.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.424
Jump.

03:43.457 --> 03:46.560
Jump. J... jump.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.730
Speak, like... arf.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.399
Uh...

03:51.432 --> 03:52.733
Roll over.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.868
Like...

03:54.902 --> 03:57.271
Roll...

03:57.305 --> 03:59.507
Roll over.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.675
I tried monkey see, monkey do,

04:01.709 --> 04:03.277
which is useless with a dog.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.749
Hey, I made a complete list
of what's missing.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.951
You didn't put
a dishwasher on here.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.320
We don't have a dishwasher.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.821
We will if they find one.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.423
I'm calling
the insurance company.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.558
No, no, no, I don't want
my premiums going up.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.660
Insurance is just
for emergencies.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.829
Well, Julius,
isn't this an emergency?

04:21.862 --> 04:24.064
They took the meat.
They took the TV.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.833
They took my James Brown album.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.901
I mean, the only way
they could take something else

04:27.935 --> 04:29.337
is if they brought
something back.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.905
Look, just let me look
around the neighborhood

04:31.939 --> 04:33.774
for our stuff first.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.609
Whoever did this can't
be that far away.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.077
Well, how do you know that?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.779
Who comes to Bed

04:38.812 --> 04:39.913
Crackheads, bowling ballhead.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.383
You go ahead
and look around.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.753
In the meantime, I'm putting
this place on lockdown.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.020
Because the TV was stolen,

04:47.054 --> 04:49.623
Drew and Tonya tried to get
their fix any place they could.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.793
Captain Kangaroo
is so funny.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.663
I'm calling the cops,
you peeping Toms.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.897
Get out of here!

04:58.999 --> 04:59.967
A dog.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.469
That's so cool.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.771
Yeah, but I can't get
him to do anything.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.042
Here's a couple of books
on dog training.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.712
You just happen to have books
on dog training in your locker?

05:11.745 --> 05:13.547
I got lots of stuff in here.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.682
Let's see...

05:14.715 --> 05:17.685
Got a bartender's guide,
an auction catalog

05:17.718 --> 05:19.587
to fine crystal,
mostly Lalique,

05:19.620 --> 05:21.855
How to Fly
a Helicopter,

05:21.889 --> 05:23.724
The Idiot's Guide
to Tic-Tac-Toe,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.793
a Gutenberg Bible...

05:25.826 --> 05:28.662
and a street guide
to Baghdad.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.963
You never know.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.500
That guidebook lists
a lot more streets

05:32.533 --> 05:34.001
than they have left
in Baghdad now.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.202
Well, thanks. These should help.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.971
Remember, you should be the only
one bonding with the dog.

05:38.005 --> 05:38.972
Why?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.508
To be a good watchdog,

05:40.541 --> 05:42.810
he has to report to one master.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.878
Otherwise, he may befriend
the bad guys.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.147
I was going to have to do
what Greg said.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.418
Even though being master
to something named Blackie

05:50.451 --> 05:53.987
seemed like a bad idea.

05:54.021 --> 05:58.025
At home, my mother installed
a ghetto alarm system.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.660
Hey, Ms. Rochelle.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.061
What's going on?

06:01.094 --> 06:02.763
We got robbed.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.064
You got robbed

06:04.097 --> 06:05.132
Two nights ago.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.000
Where were you?
I was at home.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.702
Didn't you hear anything?

06:08.736 --> 06:10.604
Oh, no, I was busy.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.139
Well, they cleaned out
half the house.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.442
Well, the important thing
is you got your health.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.577
Material things don't matter.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.812
'Cause after all,
you can't take it with you.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.748
That's 'cause they took it all
with them.

06:20.781 --> 06:21.782
The next person

06:21.815 --> 06:22.583
that walks through
this door

06:22.616 --> 06:24.852
is gonna hear
bells a-jingling.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.787
Jingling bells.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.525
Let me show you something
over there, okay?

06:33.193 --> 06:35.696
Well, see, if anybody tried
to get through the window...

06:35.729 --> 06:38.599
Huh

06:38.632 --> 06:40.601
Blocked by a broomstick.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.869
But do you really think
they'd try

06:41.902 --> 06:43.504
to come through
a second

06:43.537 --> 06:44.772
People can see them
from the street.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.774
Well, if they do,
they can't get in.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.742
Oh, and we got a guard dog.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.010
So if anybody comes
in this house,

06:50.043 --> 06:51.612
they gonna leave
in a casket.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.914
Casket-- now that's the type
of talk I like to hear.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.215
Well, I'll keep
my ears open.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.216
And your doors locked.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.785
All right, see you now.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.152
Hey, Mr. Omar.
Hey, how y'all doing?

06:59.186 --> 07:01.655
Hey, Ma, can me and Drew play
with Blackie?

07:01.689 --> 07:03.090
No, baby, he's a guard dog,
not a pet.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.626
DREW:
What are we
supposed to do?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.761
We don't have a TV.
We're bored.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.197
I don't know.
Maybe read a book.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.200
Reading? Now that's positive.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.569
Tonya and Drew
couldn't watch TV,

07:15.603 --> 07:17.771
but that didn't stop them
from reading it.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.872
Check this out.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.708
"Matlock at 4:00.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.109
"When Nashville star
Dolly Parton

07:22.142 --> 07:24.144
get arrested for murder,
she turns to Ben Matlock."

07:24.177 --> 07:25.178
Look at this:

07:25.212 --> 07:27.247
Moses Gunn is going to be
on The Jeffersons.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.650
Did you know
Little House on the Prairie

07:29.683 --> 07:31.852
was closed captioned
for the hearing

07:31.885 --> 07:35.489
Stephanie Mills is going
to be on Captain Kangaroo.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.958
Meanwhile, my father tried
to get clues from the clueless.

07:37.991 --> 07:38.892
Look, I want information,

07:38.926 --> 07:41.128
and word on the street
is that you got some.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.497
Where'd you hear that from?
Radio or something, man?

07:43.531 --> 07:44.965
Ain't got no damn TV,
so I heard.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.668
Maybe you should talk
to Mr. Lincoln.

07:50.070 --> 07:50.704
A penny?

07:50.738 --> 07:52.640
You can keep
your penny, man.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.007
I don't know nothing, man.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.843
I haven't heard anything.
No one's told me anything.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.811
Zero.
Hey, hey, hey, you sure?

07:57.845 --> 08:00.213
I mean, maybe you want
to talk to Mr. Roosevelt, too.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.718
Know what? I would love
to talk to Mr. Roosevelt.

08:04.752 --> 08:05.886
Yes, Mr. President.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.722
Yeah, Julius is
standing right here.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.023
Yeah, yeah.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.559
He ain't got enough money.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.060
No, he's really short of money.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.728
Yeah, he's still
standing here.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.929
I will tell him,
Mr. President.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.865
Okay, okay, I'll tell him.
Bye-bye.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.868
Um, he says to go talk
to Kill Moves

08:20.901 --> 08:23.036
'cause Kill Moves
has his ear to the street.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.873
What do you hear, Kill Moves?

08:25.906 --> 08:28.008
Four riders... two on ponies.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.143
No, about my place
getting robbed.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.846
I ain't hear anything
about that.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.148
But don't say I didn't warn you
about the coming Indian attack.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.721
My father couldn't get
our TV back,

08:40.754 --> 08:42.022
and now he'd lost his chair.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.791
What are these things?

08:43.824 --> 08:45.025
They're sporks.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.159
Aren't they great?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.261
You can eat a soup or a steak
without changing hands.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.030
ROCHELLE:
Julius, I can't
take this anymore.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.999
I feel like I'm tasting
paper plate.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.901
I'm calling
the insurance company.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.903
No, no, look, look, I already
got some of our stuff back.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.608
This is not our stuff.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.842
It's still a great picture.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.110
Dad, they're white people.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.946
Look, I got it
at a fire sale for 15 cents.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.314
But they're white people.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.082
Look, get a crayon
and color them in.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.685
I'm calling
the insurance company

09:11.719 --> 09:13.253
before you replace me
with a white woman.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.889
Right now, he's praying she
doesn't look in the freezer.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.027
MR. OMAR:
Let me in!

09:20.060 --> 09:21.028
Let me in!

09:21.061 --> 09:22.195
What is it?
I've been robbed!

09:22.229 --> 09:23.563
Lord have mercy.

09:23.597 --> 09:27.300
They broke into my house
and took one of my widows.
Mrs. Johnson?

09:27.334 --> 09:30.303
No, man, Mrs. Williams.
The redbone.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.941
Do you know how hard it is
to find a good redbone?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.676
Well, at least
you got your health.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.978
Oh, that's supposed
to be funny?

09:38.011 --> 09:41.749
I'm just saying...
you can't take it with you.

09:41.782 --> 09:42.983
I thought this place
was supposed to be protected.

09:43.016 --> 09:46.820
Y'all got bells on your doors,
broomsticks on your windows.

09:46.854 --> 09:47.921
Where were you?

09:47.955 --> 09:48.922
I was home.

09:48.956 --> 09:49.923
And you didn't hear nothing?

09:49.957 --> 09:52.693
I was busy, you know.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.094
You were busy?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.629
Okay...

09:55.663 --> 09:58.198
look, I can't live
under these conditions, okay?

09:58.231 --> 10:00.167
If I don't get
my redbone back,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.035
I expect a reduction
in my rent.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.671
Whoa, whoa, whoa, a
reduction in your rent?

10:03.704 --> 10:04.705
Did I stutter?

10:04.738 --> 10:07.340
And you need to get rid
of that dog and get a gun.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.079
Blackie, get out of my chair!

10:12.112 --> 10:13.981
He's guarding it.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.921
Oh, Lord, he done done it now!

10:20.954 --> 10:23.290
All right, now, Chris,
this is it.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.393
You got 48 hours to train
that dog or he's dog food.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.095
Dogs aren't used in dog food,

10:28.128 --> 10:30.130
but this wasn't a good time
to correct my father.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.104
I loved Blackie,
but I'm in trouble.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.306
Blackie, no! Stop!
Come back!

10:39.339 --> 10:42.042
I didn't know which one
was more dangerous:

10:42.075 --> 10:43.977
Blackie running into the street

10:44.011 --> 10:46.246
or running over
to that Puerto Rican fellow.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.982
Thanks, man.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.117
Oh, no problem.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.719
It's amazing.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.120
Every time I command him,
he doesn't do anything.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.688
Sientate.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.091
Levantate.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.861
I guess he speaks
Puerto Rican.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.062
But I don't.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.164
Well, that's too bad.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.465
Hey, well,
you live around here?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.300
I don't live too far.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.201
What's your name?

11:08.235 --> 11:09.169
I'm Carlos.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.704
Chris.
All right, Chris.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.405
So you think you can teach me
some Spanish

11:12.439 --> 11:13.406
so I can train him?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.008
Sure, yeah.

11:15.042 --> 11:18.411
While I was getting help,
my parents needed help.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.315
I'm afraid your policy
doesn't cover

11:22.349 --> 11:23.116
all of your losses.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.352
What are you talking
about

11:25.385 --> 11:27.821
Well, let me make sure
I have all the facts first.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.056
Was there any wind damage?

11:29.089 --> 11:29.823
No.

11:29.857 --> 11:30.958
Ah. That's too bad

11:30.991 --> 11:32.059
'cause you're covered for that.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.061
We're covered
for wind damage?

11:34.094 --> 11:36.930
Any fire or flood associated
with the loss?

11:36.964 --> 11:38.365
No, we got robbed.

11:38.398 --> 11:42.202
Well, then there's not much
I can do.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.338
Although, we at Mutual Farms
appreciate your business.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.375
Their slogan was "You're in
white hands with Mutual Farms."

11:48.408 --> 11:49.843
Wait.
What about the meat?

11:49.877 --> 11:53.180
I mean, we lost
$117.43 worth of meat.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.148
I'm sorry.
According to our records,

11:55.182 --> 11:57.084
you opted out
of the meat coverage.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.019
At the time, we didn't have
any meat to cover.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.153
So let me get this straight.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.421
You're not paying us
for the meat.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.923
You're not paying us
for the stereo,

12:02.956 --> 12:04.057
but what are we
paying you for?

12:04.091 --> 12:07.094
Peace of mind.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.161
Peace of mind.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.963
We don't want
peace of mind.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.264
We want a piece of furniture.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.066
I understand that, but...

12:13.100 --> 12:14.367
Look here, mister,

12:14.401 --> 12:16.403
we have been your customers
over ten years.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.238
This is our first phone call
to you.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.340
And believe me, there have been
many other problems.

12:20.373 --> 12:23.076
One time it flooded.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.212
Can we call
the insurance company now?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.246
No.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.081
Now we have a swimming pool.

12:28.115 --> 12:31.051
Another time a plane
dropped a load.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.821
Can we call
the insurance company now?

12:33.854 --> 12:37.157
No way. Now we
have new luggage.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.426
One time, aliens took over.

12:41.829 --> 12:45.032
Now can I call
the insurance company?

12:45.065 --> 12:47.100
No, I've always wanted
to go to another planet.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.236
Can't you do something to help?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.204
I'll see what I can do.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.174
Mm, peanut butter?

12:56.176 --> 12:59.179
He's lucky she didn't pull away
any of his teeth.

13:04.484 --> 13:08.188
Negrito, bajate, sientate.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.322
What did you call him?

13:10.157 --> 13:11.058
What was that?

13:11.091 --> 13:13.126
Oh, training the dog in Spanish.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.027
Why?

13:14.061 --> 13:16.229
It's part
of the attack-dog training.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.498
Like you can only talk
to a German Shepherd in German

13:18.531 --> 13:20.200
or Irish Wolfhound in Irish.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.269
This is a Puerto Rican mutt.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.436
Well, I don't care
what he speaks

13:23.470 --> 13:25.138
as long as he stays
out of my chair

13:25.172 --> 13:26.306
and you turn him into a killer.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.140
Bueno.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.141
¿Que?

13:28.175 --> 13:29.209
Nada.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.079
Drew and Tonya finally settled
on an activity

13:32.112 --> 13:34.481
they could both enjoy:
prank phone calls.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.083
Do you have
pig's feet?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.484
WOMAN:
Yes, yes, we do.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.020
Well, if you wear shoes,
nobody would notice.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.591
Hello

13:44.624 --> 13:46.126
A Mr. I.P. Freely?

13:48.328 --> 13:49.863
Hi, I'm just confirming

13:49.897 --> 13:52.399
that I have a hundred
large pieces ordered

13:52.432 --> 13:54.267
to Mr. Omar's
Funeral Home?

13:54.301 --> 13:55.335
MAN:
I'll check.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.636
Yes, okay.
Thank you.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.305
Tragic.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.208
WOMAN:
911 emergency.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.442
Help! Help!
They're choking me!

14:02.475 --> 14:04.177
Come here, woman!
Shut up, girl!

14:04.211 --> 14:06.246
Stay calm, ma'am.
Come here!

14:06.279 --> 14:07.480
Hey, hey,
get back here!

14:07.514 --> 14:10.317
While Drew and Tonya
made crank calls,

14:10.350 --> 14:12.085
the insurance company made
the right call.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.087
We got the settlement check
from the insurance company!

14:14.121 --> 14:15.222
Let me see!
We're going
shopping, baby!

14:15.255 --> 14:16.323
We are going shopping!

14:16.356 --> 14:18.591
"$715.13"!

14:18.625 --> 14:21.661
We going shopping!
We going shopping!

14:21.694 --> 14:24.297
I didn't just learn Spanish.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.333
I learned
about a whole new world,

14:26.366 --> 14:29.202
a world that ironically
wasn't too different

14:29.236 --> 14:30.403
than the world I already knew.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.240
There was a Puerto Rican
Kill Moves.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.977
There was a Puerto Rican Doc.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.211
¿Aqui?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.380
There was a Puerto Rican Risky.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.016
Ten dollars.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.118
Gracias.
Okay.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.123
There was even
a Puerto Rican Jerome.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.158
Hey,

14:51.191 --> 14:52.325
papi de otra calle.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.161
Let me hold un dollar, papa.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.329
Everything was different,
but getting robbed still hurt.

14:56.363 --> 14:59.266
Gracias, hermano.

14:59.299 --> 15:03.370
* I know and you know
that if we get together *

15:03.403 --> 15:05.138
Hey, Carlos.

15:05.172 --> 15:09.342
Hey, mamita.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.244
Que lindo es el doggie?

15:11.278 --> 15:12.345
Cómo se llama?

15:12.379 --> 15:13.580
Tell her his name.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.348
Oh, his name's Blackie.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.483
Aye, Negrito.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.318
Y tu nombre?

15:18.351 --> 15:19.619
Your name.
What's your name?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.021
Oh, my name's Chris.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.390
Hola, Chris. I'm Thalia.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.026
This is my amiga Claudia,
y my prima Luz.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.528
This dog was magic.
Girls liked me.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.662
Pretty Puerto Rican girls!

15:29.696 --> 15:31.364
How do you know Carlos?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.565
Oh, well, he's teaching me
Spanish

15:32.599 --> 15:34.567
so I can train Blackie
to be a guard dog.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.305
What's so funny?

15:38.338 --> 15:40.307
Blackie can't
be a guard dog.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.174
Why not?

15:41.208 --> 15:44.477
Give me that.
Watch this. Watch this.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.647
Blackie, ataca! Ataca!

15:47.680 --> 15:49.349
To y'all that don't speak
Spanish,

15:49.382 --> 15:51.051
that means "attack."

15:56.056 --> 15:57.290
Miralo. Miralo.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.292
Lassie, go get help.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.994
The Puerto Rican girls
are laughing at me.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.096
This dog is a lover,
not a fighter.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.432
In fact,
Blackie was such a lover,

16:05.465 --> 16:08.201
we have to go
to commercial right now.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.041
Man, this is like nothing
you ever seen before.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.408
All the girls
call me "Papi."

16:15.442 --> 16:16.676
Papi? You're
so in there.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.677
¿Que paso, mami?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.312
Nada mucho, papi.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.380
See?

16:20.413 --> 16:21.414
That's so cool.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.250
But aren't you supposed

16:23.283 --> 16:25.052
to be teaching Blackie
to attack intruders?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.453
I'm working on it.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.321
This book may help.

16:28.355 --> 16:32.159
Turn Your Pup into a Perp:
Teaching Dogs to Kill.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.660
Perfect.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.364
I was going to do everything
I could

16:37.397 --> 16:40.067
to get the attack
out of Blackie.

16:48.608 --> 16:52.445
* Superhighways,
coast to coast *

16:52.479 --> 16:56.149
* Easy to get anywhere

16:56.183 --> 17:01.554
* On the transcontinental
overload *

17:01.588 --> 17:03.356
* Just slide behind the wheel

17:03.390 --> 17:05.258
* How does it feel?

17:05.292 --> 17:07.660
* When there's no destination
that's too far *

17:07.694 --> 17:09.362
Good boy.

17:09.396 --> 17:14.434
* And somewhere on the way,
you might find out who you are *

17:14.467 --> 17:17.137
Blackie couldn't fly
if he was a bald eagle.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.438
* I feel good!

17:18.471 --> 17:21.508
There was only one more stop in
the Blackie training program.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.775
Okay, so before we leave,

17:22.809 --> 17:25.245
he needs to smell all you guys
so he knows not to attack you.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.479
Will he attack Mr. Omar?

17:26.513 --> 17:28.148
Oh, oh!

17:28.181 --> 17:29.449
Mr. Omar!

17:29.482 --> 17:32.319
Okay, so this is my sister
Tonya right here.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.587
And this is my brother Drew.

17:34.621 --> 17:38.658
Okay, this is my mom
Rochelle right here.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.592
Okay, okay, okay.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.428
Chris, hurry up
so I can get to the store

17:41.461 --> 17:42.862
before all the good stuff
is gone.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.133
And this is my father Julius.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.200
Hey!

17:48.301 --> 17:50.537
And this is Mr. Omar,
my neighbor.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.504
And what is that?

17:51.538 --> 17:54.874
Uh, these belong
to some of my lady friends.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.743
I just want to make sure
they're safe.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.645
The only dog they have
to worry about is you.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.148
Come on, y'all.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.317
You like that red...

18:04.351 --> 18:06.486
I figured even if Blackie
wasn't a killer,

18:06.519 --> 18:07.754
what difference did it make?

18:07.787 --> 18:10.290
We'd already been robbed twice.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.858
What were the chances
it would happen again?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.529
They broke in again?!

18:16.563 --> 18:18.198
Everybody get back!

18:18.231 --> 18:21.568
Let me go first
in case they're still inside.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.703
Hey, give me something
to use as a weapon.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.407
Hey, I got a gun!

18:27.440 --> 18:30.510
Yeah, it just looks
like a frying pan.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.448
They took my bells?!

18:35.482 --> 18:36.616
JULIUS:
Come on in!

18:36.649 --> 18:38.851
I cannot believe this!

18:38.885 --> 18:40.553
Wonder what they took
this time.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.422
Hey, at least they didn't take
the TV Digest.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.657
It doesn't look like
anything is missing.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.858
Maybe Blackie
scared 'em off.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.228
I don't think so.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.329
Blackie's gone.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.897
They stole Blackie?

18:52.565 --> 18:53.600
I love having a dog,

18:53.633 --> 18:56.669
and losing Blackie made me
really depressed.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.906
Plus, having the Lassie,
Rin Tin Tin, Sounder,

18:59.939 --> 19:02.275
Turner & Hooch marathon
on TV didn't help.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.277
Move, boy.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.312
Who is it?!

19:05.345 --> 19:06.779
Police!

19:07.914 --> 19:09.916
Is this about the robbery?

19:09.949 --> 19:12.685
No, our emergency
operators traced

19:12.719 --> 19:13.720
several prank
phone calls

19:13.753 --> 19:14.821
back to this number.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.456
ROCHELLE:
Prank phone calls?

19:16.489 --> 19:19.592
Yes. Calls to I.P. Freely,
pizza orders

19:19.626 --> 19:20.793
and finally, a distress call

19:20.827 --> 19:22.529
that a woman was getting
choked to death.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.931
That's not even funny.
I don't get it.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.433
It's absurdist.
You're not supposed to.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.700
Chris, do you know
anything about this?

19:27.734 --> 19:28.701
No.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.603
Drew?
What?

19:30.637 --> 19:32.605
Tonya?
Huh?

19:32.639 --> 19:35.408
Do y'all know
anything about this?

19:35.442 --> 19:36.909
About what?
About what?

19:36.943 --> 19:39.379
About what?

19:39.412 --> 19:41.614
I'm sorry, officer.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.583
This won't happen again.
Trust me.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.455
So y'all like
getting choked, huh?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.324
Oh, you better run.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.560
You better run
as fast as you can.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.630
I thought I'd never see
Blackie again.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.533
Blackie, comóestás?
How are you?

20:00.567 --> 20:02.902
And he thought he'd never
seen me before.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.638
Blackie, remember, it's me,
Chris, tu amigo?

20:07.640 --> 20:10.477
Hey, papi, tranquilo.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.981
Papi, tranquilo.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.850
No, no, no!

20:20.620 --> 20:24.524
* Todo el mundo odia a Chris. *

20:29.729 --> 20:33.933
