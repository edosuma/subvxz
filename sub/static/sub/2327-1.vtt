13:57.601 --> 13:59.870
Eh...

13:59.871 --> 14:03.673
Aye, you've gotta go straight
along that way and...

14:04.608 --> 14:06.677
This is gonna be pure
hard to explain.

14:06.678 --> 14:09.146
- Do you know where the Asda is?
- No.

14:09.147 --> 14:12.316
Yeah, I don't even know what
way you're pointin'. What?

14:12.317 --> 14:14.423
See, if you just drive
straight along up there...

14:14.424 --> 14:17.621
- Yes?
- And see the traffic lights up there?

14:17.622 --> 14:20.991
Take a right. Then you'll go
past Ibrox Stadium, right?

14:20.992 --> 14:22.860
And go straight
through a roundabout.

14:22.861 --> 14:27.598
Then take a left. So
it's right, then just...

14:27.599 --> 14:30.801
And it's there. The motorway is there.
It's back of Asda. You'll see it.

14:30.802 --> 14:32.937
- Back of Asda, see?
- Okay.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.238
- Am I keeping you from something?
- No.

14:36.307 --> 14:38.242
- Where are you going?
- Along here.

14:38.243 --> 14:41.679
- For what? For work?
- No, I need to go meet somebody.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.280
- Oh, you're going to meet someone.
- Aye.

14:43.281 --> 14:44.681
- All right. Thank you.
- Sure.

15:15.779 --> 15:17.915
I'm looking for a post office.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.950
- Post office?
- Yes.

15:19.951 --> 15:21.318
Where are you from?

15:21.319 --> 15:22.753
- Where I am from?
- Yeah.

15:22.754 --> 15:25.289
- Albania.
- Oh, are you?

15:25.290 --> 15:26.857
- You have family here?
- Yes.

15:26.858 --> 15:28.325
Oh, you do.

15:28.326 --> 15:31.328
That's the reason I'm saying
you have to go another way...

15:31.329 --> 15:33.631
for another...

15:33.632 --> 15:35.732
It's after the shopping ce...

15:58.389 --> 16:00.824
- Hi.
- Lost?

16:00.825 --> 16:02.826
- Yeah, lost.
- What are you looking for?

16:02.827 --> 16:05.229
- I'm looking for the M8.
- Up to the roundabout...

16:05.230 --> 16:07.197
- Are you walking?
- Yep.

16:07.198 --> 16:09.266
- Where are you walking to?
- Home.

16:09.267 --> 16:12.269
- Oh, you're going home. To your family?
- No, no, just myself.

16:12.270 --> 16:14.405
- Just yourself?
- Aye. It's great.

16:14.406 --> 16:18.008
- Yeah? How?
- I can do whatever I like.

16:18.009 --> 16:20.444
- So where are you coming from?
- Govan. Right there.

16:20.445 --> 16:22.179
- Sorry?
- Govan.

16:22.180 --> 16:25.315
- Govan? Do you work there?
- No, no.

16:25.316 --> 16:27.818
Don't work there.
I work for myself.

16:27.819 --> 16:31.287
- Do you want a lift?
- Eh... Aye, why not?

16:38.195 --> 16:40.831
You'll have to tell
me how to get there.

16:40.832 --> 16:43.366
- Just follow this road straight up.
- Okay.

16:44.301 --> 16:46.103
Sure.

16:46.104 --> 16:48.372
- So what do you do?
- Electrician.

16:48.373 --> 16:49.806
Oh, you're an electrician.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.811
It's cold, right?

16:53.812 --> 16:56.412
- Ah, it's a wee bit nippy, aye.
- Yeah.

16:57.981 --> 16:59.783
So what is it youse all doing?

16:59.784 --> 17:01.885
I'm... I'm just, uh, driving...

17:01.886 --> 17:06.290
just, uh... some furniture
for my family and...

17:06.290 --> 17:08.892
- Oh, right?
- Yeah.

17:08.893 --> 17:10.394
So you live alone?

17:10.395 --> 17:12.162
- Yes.
- And you love it?

17:12.163 --> 17:15.398
- Aye. It's great.
- What do you love about living alone?

17:15.400 --> 17:18.301
- Nobody to nag you.
- Do I go straight through?

17:18.303 --> 17:21.337
Yeah, just straight through.
Straight through the whole way.

17:54.772 --> 17:58.041
It should be just cart around that
street and stay in the right hand lane.

17:58.042 --> 18:00.310
- What's that?
- That's a tattoo of my name.

18:00.311 --> 18:01.979
- Of your name?
- Yeah.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.213
- What's your name?
- Andy.

18:03.214 --> 18:04.848
- Andy. Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.

18:04.849 --> 18:07.484
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you very much.

18:07.485 --> 18:09.820
Andy!

18:09.821 --> 18:11.021
- Want me?
- You coming?

18:16.360 --> 18:19.463
The spot back here, you get... you put
your hand out. Anybody can stop.

18:19.464 --> 18:22.266
There's lonely old guys.
Know what I mean?

18:22.267 --> 18:25.869
It was... Hey, might as well check
her out, driving away in a big van.

18:25.870 --> 18:29.005
Sure you can drive this, huh? Huh?

18:32.442 --> 18:35.512
- No girlfriend? Really?
- Nah, I don't have a girlfriend at all.

18:35.513 --> 18:38.047
You're very charming.

18:42.119 --> 18:43.586
That's better.

18:45.055 --> 18:47.189
Yeah? Sorted?

18:48.225 --> 18:50.327
- You have a handsome face.
- Aye?

18:50.328 --> 18:53.130
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot. Cheers.

18:53.131 --> 18:55.566
- Do you think I'm pretty?
- I think you're gorgeous.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.633
- Do you?
- Aye, definitely.

18:58.135 --> 19:00.002
Good.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.575
And a friendly smile as well.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.877
- Do I?
- Aye, right deep.

19:06.878 --> 19:09.012
- What about your smile?
- Aye.

19:09.013 --> 19:10.514
You've a nice smile yourself.

19:10.515 --> 19:12.916
- Cheers.
- Good.

19:12.917 --> 19:14.450
Good.

21:54.411 --> 21:56.345
No, no, no, lads! No!

22:52.402 --> 22:55.171
Mommy! Whoo!

23:54.297 --> 23:56.166
I thought...

23:56.167 --> 23:57.801
you had your eye on my towel.

23:57.802 --> 24:00.203
No. I wanted to speak to you.

24:00.204 --> 24:02.804
Do you know if there's any good
spots to surf around here?

24:03.440 --> 24:07.310
I'm not a surfer. Just living
in a little tent over there.

24:07.311 --> 24:10.213
- Just hanging around.
- Yeah?

24:10.214 --> 24:13.349
- Reading, swimming.
- You're not from here? Where are you from?

24:14.885 --> 24:17.987
- I'm from Czech Republic.
- Why are you in Scotland?

24:20.357 --> 24:22.692
I just... wanted to
get away from it all.

24:22.693 --> 24:24.928
Yeah? Why here?

24:24.929 --> 24:26.930
Because it's...

24:26.931 --> 24:28.397
It's nowhere.

32:59.942 --> 33:02.979
Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.

33:02.980 --> 33:05.314
Can I talk to you before
you run away, darling?

33:05.315 --> 33:07.884
I wanted to speak to you earlier,
right, but you disappeared.

33:07.885 --> 33:10.787
I thought you went to
the ladies' or somethin'.

33:10.788 --> 33:14.257
Anyway, right, fuck
all that shite. Right?

33:14.258 --> 33:17.060
I really want to buy you a drink,
man. You look absolutely stunning.

33:17.061 --> 33:18.861
And I...

33:18.862 --> 33:22.065
You know what? I'm all
alone. You're all alone.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.267
What do you say? What's one drink?

33:24.268 --> 33:26.035
What's one drink?

33:26.036 --> 33:28.805
- I saw you on the road.
- What, you saw <i>me</i> on the road?

33:28.806 --> 33:31.441
- Earlier, yeah.
- Are you having a laugh with me?

33:31.442 --> 33:33.943
You saw me? You wanna come
get a drink and a dance?

33:33.944 --> 33:36.746
- Are you alone here?
- Yeah, I'm all alone. Right?

39:03.506 --> 39:07.575
The man from the car,
he buy the rose for you.

40:03.299 --> 40:07.236
A man's body has been found
washed up on a beach... near Arbroath.

40:07.237 --> 40:09.805
His wife and child are
reported missing.

40:09.806 --> 40:12.241
The police say the body
has been identified...

40:12.242 --> 40:15.277
as 36-year-old Kenneth
McClelland from Edinburgh.

40:15.278 --> 40:17.480
The body was found by a tourist...

40:17.481 --> 40:20.583
and is believed to have been
in the water for some time.

40:20.584 --> 40:25.387
Mr. McClelland was married and worked as a
chemistry lecturer at Edinburgh University.

40:25.388 --> 40:29.158
The alarm was raised when he failed
to turn up for work this morning.

40:29.159 --> 40:32.661
His car was found at the
nearby Deer Park Golf Club.

40:32.662 --> 40:36.232
His wife, 32-year-old Alison
McClelland, and 18-month-old son...

40:36.233 --> 40:38.434
are believed to have been with him.

40:38.435 --> 40:41.570
A police and coast guard search
operation involving a helicopter...

40:41.571 --> 40:43.739
has been halted due to fog.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.574
The next bulletin is on the hour.

40:48.545 --> 40:50.346
Well, plenty to talk
about, as ever, with Kay.

40:50.347 --> 40:53.182
You can call now...
10-500-92-95-00.

40:53.183 --> 40:55.184
You can text as well... 80295.

40:55.185 --> 40:57.353
- It's 8:17.
- Good morning, Gary.

40:57.354 --> 41:00.222
Well, as we've heard, for a
whole host of reasons...

41:00.223 --> 41:02.558
2014 is a very important
year for Scotland.

41:02.559 --> 41:04.860
Of course, the referendum. We're
expecting that date today.

41:04.861 --> 41:07.930
But the Commonwealth
Games and Ryder Cup...

41:07.931 --> 41:10.299
- You seem very excited about that.
- I am.

41:10.300 --> 41:13.701
He's jumping out of his seat at the
prospect of the year he's gonna have...

41:49.939 --> 41:53.508
<i>Fuckin' hell, you're gorgeous.</i>

41:55.611 --> 41:57.845
- You think so?
- It's your eyes.

41:58.948 --> 42:01.449
Somethin' about your eyes.

42:02.384 --> 42:04.887
Your eyes, your lips.

42:04.888 --> 42:07.055
- That black hair.
- Yeah?

42:10.259 --> 42:11.993
You just look...

42:13.262 --> 42:14.830
amazing.

45:25.487 --> 45:27.122
Hey, you okay?

45:35.497 --> 45:38.566
Want a hand up? Want a hand?

49:23.225 --> 49:25.894
Get out, eh? Get out!

51:07.295 --> 51:08.863
Excuse me.

51:10.132 --> 51:11.767
Excuse me.

51:11.768 --> 51:14.770
Uh, I'm a bit lost, really.

51:14.771 --> 51:16.937
Am I headed towards Taynuilt?

51:17.939 --> 51:19.040
Yeah.

51:19.041 --> 51:21.977
I am? Is it far?

51:21.978 --> 51:24.146
It's about 10 minutes away.

51:24.147 --> 51:26.413
Ten minutes? Are you...
Are you headed there?

51:27.315 --> 51:31.051
- I'm going to the supermarket.
- Is it on the way?

51:34.256 --> 51:36.057
Yeah.

51:36.058 --> 51:38.225
I could drop you off if you'd like.

51:43.999 --> 51:46.000
Yeah?

52:14.930 --> 52:17.464
Here. Let me turn this up for you.

52:26.074 --> 52:28.042
That's better.

52:43.158 --> 52:44.992
You're very quiet.

52:50.932 --> 52:53.267
So why do you shop at night then?

52:57.372 --> 52:59.206
People wind me up.

53:01.443 --> 53:02.609
How?

53:04.913 --> 53:06.714
They're ignorant.

53:10.318 --> 53:12.686
What about your friends?

53:15.957 --> 53:18.092
So you don't have any friends?

53:23.265 --> 53:24.465
No.

53:25.467 --> 53:27.201
How about a girlfriend?

53:33.408 --> 53:35.142
How old are you?

53:36.611 --> 53:38.278
I'm 26.

53:40.148 --> 53:43.050
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

53:45.420 --> 53:47.589
Never had one.

53:47.590 --> 53:49.423
So don't you get lonely then?

53:56.698 --> 53:58.532
You've very nice hands.

54:03.672 --> 54:05.572
You've beautiful hands.

54:27.529 --> 54:29.998
Do you want to look at me?

54:29.999 --> 54:32.366
- This isn't Tesco's, is it?
- No.

54:38.540 --> 54:41.108
I noticed you looking at me before.

54:46.614 --> 54:48.148
And?

54:49.617 --> 54:51.618
I liked it.

54:56.224 --> 54:58.460
You're uncomfortable.

54:58.461 --> 55:01.261
No. Just want to go to Tesco's.

55:07.402 --> 55:10.137
So you never think about it then?

55:12.607 --> 55:14.341
Think about what?

55:15.543 --> 55:17.778
Being with a girl.

55:24.052 --> 55:26.619
When was the last time
you touched someone?

55:38.700 --> 55:40.601
Let me see your hands.

55:47.509 --> 55:49.176
Cold.

55:52.380 --> 55:54.148
I have to get back soon.

56:05.293 --> 56:07.261
How was that?

56:08.163 --> 56:09.463
Cold.

56:12.667 --> 56:15.236
Do you want to do it again?

56:15.237 --> 56:17.337
Yeah.

56:25.146 --> 56:27.382
Do you want to touch my neck?

56:27.383 --> 56:29.216
Here.

56:37.459 --> 56:39.760
How was that?

56:41.463 --> 56:43.297
Yeah.

56:44.699 --> 56:46.800
Your hands are very soft.

56:54.509 --> 56:57.344
I have a place about
30 minutes away.

56:58.480 --> 57:00.881
Will you come with me there?

57:59.807 --> 58:01.576
Cold.

58:01.577 --> 58:03.877
I won't let that stop us.

58:23.665 --> 58:25.332
Come to me.

58:40.615 --> 58:42.450
Dreaming?

58:42.451 --> 58:43.851
Yes.

58:43.852 --> 58:45.587
Dreaming?

58:45.588 --> 58:47.421
Yes, we are.

01:09:46.647 --> 01:09:49.615
The bus will be along in a minute.

01:10:45.472 --> 01:10:47.854
Do you not think you should be
wearing a jacket, little lass?

01:10:47.855 --> 01:10:50.010
The weather's terrible up here.

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:54.280
You'll catch your death of cold if you've
not got a jacket or a hat or something on.

01:10:57.518 --> 01:11:00.186
You've not got the right
clothes on at all.

01:11:07.594 --> 01:11:09.495
You all right there?

01:11:11.665 --> 01:11:13.399
Eh?

01:11:14.368 --> 01:11:16.202
You okay?

01:11:21.408 --> 01:11:22.977
Can I do something for you?

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.679
Chase yourself, dafty.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.781
Leave the lassie alone. She doesn't
want anything to do with you.

01:11:37.391 --> 01:11:39.492
Do you need any help?

01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:50.837
Yes.

01:11:58.312 --> 01:12:00.179
Right.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.328
Let me just take your coat.

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:23.956
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.</i>

01:14:26.426 --> 01:14:28.829
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar... Wonder whether
that's working, don't you?</i>

01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:30.397
Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.

01:14:30.398 --> 01:14:32.266
Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:34.300
Spoon, Jar. Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.

01:14:40.408 --> 01:14:42.008
Stop!

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.748
Stop!

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.350
<i>Pull it. Pull it.</i>

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:58.057
<i>Now I've stood on your shadow</i>

01:14:59.726 --> 01:15:01.894
<i>And I've watched it grow</i>

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:06.065
<i>And it's shaken and
it's driven me</i>

01:15:07.267 --> 01:15:09.436
<i>And let me know
Let me know</i>

01:15:09.437 --> 01:15:13.339
<i>Let me know, let me know about
all the old forty-fives</i>

01:15:14.441 --> 01:15:16.742
<i>And the paperback rooms</i>

01:15:17.978 --> 01:15:20.846
<i>And it's scattered
all the photographs</i>

01:15:21.915 --> 01:15:23.883
<i>Of summers and suns</i>

01:15:25.252 --> 01:15:27.753
<i>And you're a real gone kid</i>

01:15:29.556 --> 01:15:33.260
<i>And maybe now, baby
Maybe now, baby</i>

01:15:33.261 --> 01:15:36.597
<i>Maybe now, baby
Maybe now, baby</i>

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:37.965
<i>And maybe now, baby</i>

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:40.434
<i>Maybe now, baby</i>

01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:42.368
<i>I'll do what I should have di</i>

01:15:43.537 --> 01:15:45.839
<i>'Cause you're a real</i>

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.073
<i>Gone...</i>

01:16:17.004 --> 01:16:18.904
Night.

01:20:35.161 --> 01:20:36.929
You all right?

01:20:42.302 --> 01:20:44.937
If you're frightened, let's go.

01:20:51.111 --> 01:20:52.811
Come on.

01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.081
It's all right.

01:20:57.217 --> 01:20:59.051
That's it.

01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:38.724
It's okay. It's okay.

01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:53.005
It's okay.

01:21:54.174 --> 01:21:56.108
It's okay.

01:22:01.214 --> 01:22:03.215
All right.

01:22:06.386 --> 01:22:08.288
Okay.

01:22:08.289 --> 01:22:10.223
You did it.

01:22:10.224 --> 01:22:12.057
You did it.

01:26:25.078 --> 01:26:26.378
You all right?

01:28:33.272 --> 01:28:36.442
You just off for a ramble
in the woods then? Eh?

01:28:36.443 --> 01:28:38.823
- Huh?
- You just off for a ramble in the woods?

01:28:38.824 --> 01:28:42.715
Yeah, yeah? Oh, it's, uh... Watch how
you step here. It's a bit, uh...

01:28:42.716 --> 01:28:46.152
It's a bit slippery round here,
but... this time of year.

01:28:46.153 --> 01:28:50.323
It's all right in summer. Well, it's still
wet in summer, but not as bad as it is now.

01:28:50.324 --> 01:28:52.625
But there's plenty of
trails around here.

01:28:52.626 --> 01:28:54.560
Have you been here before?

01:28:54.561 --> 01:28:56.295
No? First time? Yeah?

01:28:56.296 --> 01:28:58.664
Oh, you won't get lost.
They're all clearly marked.

01:28:58.665 --> 01:29:02.135
But, uh, there's about 2,000
acres of forest here,

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:06.072
so you shouldn't... you should have,
uh, plenty of places to go in there.

01:29:06.073 --> 01:29:07.807
- You on your own?
- Yeah.

01:29:07.808 --> 01:29:12.578
Yeah, on your own? Oh, well, it's a
nice place if you want some solitude,

01:29:12.579 --> 01:29:16.416
you know, to "gather your
thoughts" and all that, yeah?

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:19.217
- So, uh, enjoy yourself anyway, okay?
- Thank you.
