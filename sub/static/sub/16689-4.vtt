WEBVTT

00:00.828 --> 00:02.863
For the last three years,

00:02.896 --> 00:05.733
Chef Ramsay has whipped
aspiring chefs into shape

00:05.766 --> 00:07.101
on Hell's Kitchen.

00:07.134 --> 00:08.269
This is painful!

00:08.302 --> 00:09.637
Get out!
Out!

00:09.670 --> 00:11.538
Now, Gordon Ramsay,

00:11.572 --> 00:13.307
the most successful
restaurateur on the planet,

00:13.340 --> 00:15.342
with critically
acclaimed restaurants

00:15.376 --> 00:17.511
in London, Dubai,
Tokyo, and New York,

00:17.544 --> 00:19.480
is crisscrossing America

00:19.513 --> 00:22.016
for the most difficult
assignment of his career.

00:22.049 --> 00:23.751
This is disgusting!

00:23.784 --> 00:25.519
I am gobsmacked.

00:25.552 --> 00:27.688
Turning around America's
kitchen nightmares.

00:27.721 --> 00:29.290
Please help me!

00:29.323 --> 00:30.000
Each week he will
go to restaurants

00:30.000 --> 00:31.292
Each week he will
go to restaurants

00:31.325 --> 00:32.493
on the brink of disaster.

00:32.526 --> 00:33.594
There is no more money.

00:33.627 --> 00:35.095
He's not doing his job.

00:35.129 --> 00:36.363
This place
is a disaster zone!

00:36.397 --> 00:37.965
I put so much into it.

00:37.998 --> 00:40.434
But to get these restaurants
back on track,

00:40.467 --> 00:42.903
Chef Ramsay
will hold nothing back.

00:42.936 --> 00:44.772
I've never ever, ever...

00:44.805 --> 00:50.477
ever met someone I believe in
as little as you.

00:50.511 --> 00:51.979
It will be intense.

00:52.012 --> 00:53.914
At the wall,
you dirty pig!

00:53.947 --> 00:55.649
Do we need
a death in the restaurant

00:55.683 --> 00:57.251
before some
gets a grip?

00:57.284 --> 00:58.752
I thought your food
was crap.

00:58.786 --> 00:59.920
I'd rather have
this conversation downstairs.

00:59.953 --> 01:00.000
It will be emotional.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.488
It will be emotional.

01:01.522 --> 01:03.123
You're a!

01:03.157 --> 01:04.158
That's it!

01:04.191 --> 01:05.292
Seriously, I'm pissed off!

01:05.326 --> 01:06.360
It's not my fault!

01:06.393 --> 01:07.594
Why did you keep eating

01:07.628 --> 01:08.962
if it was that bad?

01:08.996 --> 01:10.497
Go!
Just go!

01:10.531 --> 01:11.999
And it will be shocking.

01:12.032 --> 01:13.200
Fire them on the spot.

01:13.233 --> 01:15.135
Oh, my God.
Look at them.

01:15.169 --> 01:17.638
It's ing rancid.
It's rotten.

01:17.671 --> 01:18.939
I've eaten it!

01:18.972 --> 01:20.541
I feel like spitting
on both of them.

01:20.574 --> 01:22.543
I think this place
would run better without you.

01:22.576 --> 01:25.546
Can you go tell them
that the kitchen is closed?

01:25.579 --> 01:26.780
We're shut!

01:26.814 --> 01:28.148
It's the luckiest day
of their lives!

01:28.182 --> 01:28.949
We're shut for the night?

01:28.982 --> 01:30.000
We're shut for the night!

01:30.000 --> 01:31.218
We're shut for the night!

01:31.251 --> 01:33.120
We will make this
a success.

01:33.153 --> 01:35.322
Put your hand up
and swear to God.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.591
In the end, you will see
dramatic turnarounds...

01:37.624 --> 01:41.128
Aren't they horrible?

01:41.161 --> 01:44.732
of not just the restaurants...

01:44.765 --> 01:45.999
Oh, I like this.

01:46.033 --> 01:47.568
Oh, it's fantastic.

01:47.601 --> 01:49.703
but the people
who work in them.

01:49.737 --> 01:51.205
I'll never forget you, man,
the rest of my life.

01:51.238 --> 01:52.873
You're the best, man.

01:52.906 --> 01:54.842
And while most
appreciate his help...

01:54.875 --> 01:55.909
God bless you.

01:55.943 --> 01:57.678
You're a wonderful person.

01:57.711 --> 01:59.079
Others aren't so grateful.

01:59.113 --> 02:00.000
My  kitchen!

02:00.000 --> 02:00.381
My  kitchen!

02:00.414 --> 02:01.548
Chef, I know
you can hear me!

02:01.582 --> 02:02.716
Don't run!

02:02.750 --> 02:03.884
Why is this guy here?

02:03.917 --> 02:05.252
Who the
are you

02:05.285 --> 02:06.587
to turn around
and tell me

02:06.620 --> 02:08.155
when you work
like a pig?

02:08.188 --> 02:09.223
You ing pig!

02:09.256 --> 02:10.391
Good-bye, Chef!

02:10.424 --> 02:11.992
Good luck, loser!

02:12.025 --> 02:14.027
Get ready as Chef Ramsay

02:14.061 --> 02:16.397
turns America's
kitchen nightmares...

02:16.430 --> 02:18.365
Dear God for what
we're about to receive,

02:18.399 --> 02:19.967
may the Lord not kill me
with food poisoning.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.136
back into dreams.

02:22.169 --> 02:24.772
Please do not
screw it up.

02:27.808 --> 02:30.000
*

02:30.000 --> 02:35.416
*

02:42.489 --> 02:45.025
Tonight onKitchen Nightmares,

02:45.058 --> 02:47.327
one of Long Island's
most historical

02:47.361 --> 02:51.265
and successful restaurants
has become a local disaster.

02:51.298 --> 02:52.566
It's in a dumpster now.

02:52.599 --> 02:54.001
This place
is falling apart.

02:54.034 --> 02:55.903
There's a stink
in this place so bad.

02:55.936 --> 02:58.539
And the owners,
a mother and her son...

02:58.572 --> 03:00.000
He's looking for a man.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.140
He's looking for a man.

03:00.174 --> 03:01.809
You are going
to apologize...

03:01.842 --> 03:03.377
Keep dreaming, Peter.

03:03.410 --> 03:04.878
are at each other's throats.

03:04.912 --> 03:05.412
- Take charge.
- Don't do this , Ma.

03:05.446 --> 03:06.447
Take charge.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.549
If Chef Ramsay
can't help me, it's done.

03:08.582 --> 03:10.751
Gordon has one week
to turn it around.

03:10.784 --> 03:12.152
What am I doing wrong?

03:12.186 --> 03:14.188
Touch the wall,
you dirty pig!

03:14.221 --> 03:16.790
But faces an extremely
uphill battle.

03:16.824 --> 03:19.359
You'll kill whatever customers
we've got left.

03:19.393 --> 03:20.994
The head chef is arrogant.

03:21.028 --> 03:22.563
Let him do what he wants.

03:22.596 --> 03:23.664
The sous chef doesn't care.

03:23.697 --> 03:24.932
Whatever.

03:24.965 --> 03:26.667
The waitresses are disorganized.

03:26.700 --> 03:27.468
Is that yours
or mine, Diane?

03:27.501 --> 03:28.669
This is mine!

03:28.702 --> 03:29.770
And the kitchen...

03:29.803 --> 03:30.000
This is disgusting!

03:30.000 --> 03:31.905
This is disgusting!

03:31.939 --> 03:34.608
is the dirtiest kitchen
Gordon has ever seen.

03:34.641 --> 03:36.009
Look at that.

03:36.043 --> 03:37.878
You didn't see that?
I didn't see it.

03:37.911 --> 03:38.979
I've eaten it!

03:39.012 --> 03:40.547
How will Gordon

03:40.581 --> 03:41.882
return the Seascape
to its former glory?

03:41.915 --> 03:43.584
You're running a business.

03:43.617 --> 03:44.852
And if you don't
wanna run it as a business,

03:44.885 --> 03:46.119
ing close it.

03:46.153 --> 03:48.455
Get ready
for some drastic measures.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.123
Nothing's being cooked
in here this evening.

03:50.157 --> 03:52.092
We're going down.
Now.

03:52.125 --> 03:56.463
Tonight onKitchen Nightmares.

03:58.031 --> 04:00.000
Islip, New York.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.434
Islip, New York.

04:00.467 --> 04:03.203
Rich with history
and community spirit.

04:03.237 --> 04:06.507
But a crown jewel
of this seaside village,

04:06.540 --> 04:09.810
the Seascape Inn,
is on the verge of collapse.

04:12.946 --> 04:15.516
The owners are a mother
named Irene,

04:15.549 --> 04:17.284
and a son named Peter.

04:17.317 --> 04:18.986
You can't put 'em
in the dining room, Ma.

04:19.019 --> 04:20.854
Tell them
to shut the  up.

04:20.888 --> 04:22.189
Tell them to get out of here.
What's the big deal?

04:22.222 --> 04:22.756
Close the ing doors

04:22.789 --> 04:24.358
if you don't like it.

04:24.391 --> 04:26.360
The Seascape has been around
since 1962.

04:26.393 --> 04:28.829
We've been declared
the oldest restaurant

04:28.862 --> 04:30.000
in the town of Islip.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.664
in the town of Islip.

04:30.697 --> 04:32.466
In the glory days
at the Seascape,

04:32.499 --> 04:35.869
my father, he was here
when they were doing

04:35.903 --> 04:37.738
300 covers
on a Saturday night,

04:37.771 --> 04:39.706
and the place was alive
and everybody was smiling.

04:39.740 --> 04:42.543
Making money.
There was love everywhere.

04:42.576 --> 04:43.911
You could feel it
when you walked into

04:43.944 --> 04:46.346
the Seascape.

04:46.380 --> 04:50.350
I started to work here
at the Seascape in 1967.

04:50.384 --> 04:52.219
It was buzzing.

04:52.252 --> 04:54.488
You wouldn't believe
the amount of customers we had.

04:54.521 --> 04:57.391
On Saturday night,
they'd actually stand on line

04:57.424 --> 04:58.725
outside the door.

04:58.759 --> 04:59.893
The restaurant?

04:59.927 --> 05:00.000
It's in a dumpster now.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.395
It's in a dumpster now.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.268
I don't even like
to tell people

05:08.302 --> 05:09.970
I work here anymore.

05:10.003 --> 05:11.805
There's a lot
of contributing factors

05:11.838 --> 05:13.140
of why, you know,
people don't come back.

05:13.173 --> 05:18.078
We've had complaints
about that sewage smell.

05:18.111 --> 05:20.814
There was a stink
in this place so bad.

05:20.847 --> 05:24.518
And I can't even believe
anybody came in at all.

05:24.551 --> 05:27.421
Maybe the reason why
the restaurant has gone down

05:27.454 --> 05:29.323
in the last past two years,

05:29.356 --> 05:30.000
is that Chef Doug
does not listen to a word I say.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.193
is that Chef Doug
does not listen to a word I say.

05:33.226 --> 05:34.795
Doesn't make a difference.

05:34.828 --> 05:36.263
If I want it served in that,

05:36.296 --> 05:37.464
that's what
I want it served in.

05:37.497 --> 05:39.132
I've been doing this
38 years.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.535
I went to the Culinary
Institute of America.

05:41.568 --> 05:43.370
I've worked
in successful restaurants.

05:43.403 --> 05:45.172
World-renowned.

05:45.205 --> 05:46.907
I like having the command
in the kitchen.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.041
Anybody's got a problem
with it,

05:48.075 --> 05:49.176
they can come to me.

05:49.209 --> 05:50.911
I'm gonna say my piece
wherever I go.

05:50.944 --> 05:52.479
To whoever I meet.

05:52.512 --> 05:54.047
Doesn't matter their status.
I really don't care.

05:54.081 --> 05:54.881
Don't serve it in that.

05:54.915 --> 05:55.916
That's all you gotta do.

05:55.949 --> 05:57.217
It's that simple.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.552
Doug's loud and obnoxious.

05:58.585 --> 06:00.000
You wanna rock?
Let's rock.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.721
You wanna rock?
Let's rock.

06:00.754 --> 06:01.855
He's crazy.

06:01.888 --> 06:04.591
My father,
he was a hands-on

06:04.625 --> 06:05.959
in the kitchen.

06:05.993 --> 06:07.594
I was always the guy
that was out front.

06:07.628 --> 06:11.164
And two years ago,
my father passed away.

06:11.198 --> 06:14.735
After he passed away,
it did hurt us.

06:14.768 --> 06:16.536
The rug is being
pulled out from under me.

06:16.570 --> 06:18.505
And I gotta
do something about it.

06:18.538 --> 06:20.340
I need 800 to $1 million

06:20.374 --> 06:21.675
to save the Seascape.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.777
I don't want
my doors to close.

06:23.810 --> 06:26.179
But what am I doing wrong?

06:26.213 --> 06:27.914
Chef Ramsay
is my last hope.

06:27.948 --> 06:30.000
Because if Chef Ramsay
can't help me, it's done.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.651
Because if Chef Ramsay
can't help me, it's done.

06:37.824 --> 06:40.861
This building's 105 years old.

06:40.894 --> 06:42.562
When this restaurant
first opened 40 years ago,

06:42.596 --> 06:43.830
it was the hot spot in town.

06:43.864 --> 06:45.232
Now it's at the bottom.

06:45.265 --> 06:47.067
I'm starting
to understand why.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.603
What is that
pile of  there?

06:49.636 --> 06:51.438
God.

06:51.471 --> 06:53.740
Whoa. God.

06:53.774 --> 06:55.142
Good morning.
Good morning.

06:55.175 --> 06:56.410
How are you?
How you doing?

06:56.443 --> 06:57.744
And first name, sorry?
Peter.

06:57.778 --> 06:58.812
Peter, Gordon.
Good to see you.

06:58.845 --> 07:00.000
His height threw me off.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.213
His height threw me off.

07:00.247 --> 07:02.015
Didn't realize
how tall he was.

07:02.049 --> 07:04.918
It does make you
a little bit more intimidating.

07:04.951 --> 07:07.054
Mom, this is Gordon Ramsay.

07:07.087 --> 07:08.488
Nice to see you.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

07:08.522 --> 07:09.756
Not at all.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.324
I was very impressed
with him.

07:11.358 --> 07:13.627
Very handsome, very tall.
Blond.

07:13.660 --> 07:15.228
Good looking, actually.

07:15.262 --> 07:16.830
If it was, like,
20 years ago,

07:16.863 --> 07:19.032
I would have said,
"You know what?

07:19.066 --> 07:21.201
We connect."

07:21.234 --> 07:22.736
This is, uh,
the veteran waitress Marilyn.

07:22.769 --> 07:24.571
Wow.

07:24.604 --> 07:26.306
Who has been here
since the beginning.

07:26.339 --> 07:27.641
And when you say
the beginning,

07:27.674 --> 07:29.543
how long have you been here?

07:29.576 --> 07:30.000
Well,
I really started in 1967.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.445
Well,
I really started in 1967.

07:31.478 --> 07:32.779
'67?
Right.

07:32.813 --> 07:34.681
I was born then.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.450
Maybe Chef Ramsay's
gonna tell me

07:36.483 --> 07:37.718
I just shouldn't be here,
I'm too old.

07:37.751 --> 07:39.486
And I'd respect him
if he said that.

07:39.519 --> 07:40.587
I'll be out the door.

07:40.620 --> 07:41.788
And this is the chef?

07:41.822 --> 07:43.490
Doug.
Doug, how are you?

07:43.523 --> 07:45.125
Very nice to meet you.
Nice miniskirt there.

07:45.158 --> 07:46.760
What is that, an apron?

07:46.793 --> 07:49.062
Oh, okay.
Oh, okay, yeah.

07:49.096 --> 07:50.197
Nice.
My wiping rag.

07:50.230 --> 07:51.498
That's your wiping rag.

07:51.531 --> 07:53.467
Gordon Ramsay
coming here to me,

07:53.500 --> 07:54.935
it's a slap in the face.

07:54.968 --> 07:56.603
Let's go in the dining room.

07:56.636 --> 07:58.271
Let's go.
Let's have a blast.

07:58.305 --> 07:59.339
Okay.

07:59.372 --> 08:00.000
You run the place.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.841
You run the place.

08:00.874 --> 08:02.409
And your mom assists you.

08:02.442 --> 08:03.443
Yes.

08:03.477 --> 08:04.845
Describe Seascape for me.

08:04.878 --> 08:06.947
It's the Titanic.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.750
It was a luxury liner
and it's sinking.

08:09.783 --> 08:12.719
I see it as
a very poorly run restaurant.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.255
Ask her the last time
she gave me a compliment.

08:15.288 --> 08:17.057
Because you just
don't listen.

08:17.090 --> 08:19.493
And that's why compliments
are very hard to come by.

08:19.526 --> 08:20.527
God.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.561
Right now...

08:21.595 --> 08:22.562
I'm hungry.

08:22.596 --> 08:23.864
I wanna taste the food.

08:23.897 --> 08:24.931
Let's meet after,
shall we?

08:24.965 --> 08:26.199
Why not?
Absolutely.

08:26.233 --> 08:27.300
Is there anything else
that I need to know

08:27.334 --> 08:28.568
before I start eating?

08:28.602 --> 08:30.000
The Board of Health
came here,

08:30.000 --> 08:30.170
The Board of Health
came here,

08:30.203 --> 08:31.304
and believe me,
they gave us 95.

08:31.338 --> 08:33.340
So the place is clean.

08:33.373 --> 08:34.775
Right, where shall I go
for, uh--

08:34.808 --> 08:35.776
Anywhere you like.

08:35.809 --> 08:37.144
Take the corner table.

08:37.177 --> 08:38.245
Yeah.
Comfortable
over there.

08:39.679 --> 08:40.647
Thank you.

08:40.680 --> 08:41.648
You're so welcome.

08:41.681 --> 08:43.683
I was excited.

08:43.717 --> 08:45.085
A little butterflies
in the stomach.

08:45.118 --> 08:46.153
I'm gonna be insulted

08:46.186 --> 08:47.921
by the best chef
in the world.

08:52.225 --> 08:53.360
Sewage.

08:55.295 --> 08:56.363
God.

08:56.396 --> 08:59.499
I can't believe
people come in here.

08:59.533 --> 09:00.000
Okay, I'll start off
with the crab cakes, please.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.134
Okay, I'll start off
with the crab cakes, please.

09:01.168 --> 09:02.335
Okay.

09:02.369 --> 09:03.436
I like the idea of pesto

09:03.470 --> 09:05.539
lobster ravioli.

09:05.572 --> 09:06.940
I'll go for
the Atlantic salmon,

09:06.973 --> 09:08.308
blackened, please.

09:08.341 --> 09:09.309
Call me a pig.

09:09.342 --> 09:11.144
Okay.
I'm hungry.

09:12.345 --> 09:15.882
Yeah, well, at least
she's honest.

09:15.916 --> 09:17.284
The place stinks.

09:21.888 --> 09:23.390
Who's this?

09:23.423 --> 09:24.424
That's Chef Ramsay.

09:24.457 --> 09:25.525
Okay, no problem.

09:25.559 --> 09:28.061
One order of crab cakes.

09:35.101 --> 09:38.238
God, this place
is falling apart.

09:38.271 --> 09:40.540
Let's hope the food's good.

09:40.574 --> 09:42.409
Oh, here come the crab cakes.

09:49.382 --> 09:50.450
God.

09:54.821 --> 09:57.190
Crab cake just falls apart.

09:57.224 --> 09:58.658
A bit like the decor.

09:58.692 --> 10:00.000
You touch it
and it just disintegrates.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.460
You touch it
and it just disintegrates.

10:00.493 --> 10:01.561
They're not fresh.

10:03.230 --> 10:04.931
It's not a crab cake.

10:04.965 --> 10:07.934
It's a  cake.

10:07.968 --> 10:09.035
'Cause I feel
if I eat anymore,

10:10.971 --> 10:12.405
Are they frozen?

10:12.439 --> 10:13.573
I don't think so.

10:13.607 --> 10:14.841
Would you ask them
for me?

10:14.875 --> 10:16.109
Sure.
They taste frozen.

10:16.142 --> 10:18.311
Okay.
Thank you.

10:18.345 --> 10:20.413
Doug, you make
the crab cakes here, right?

10:20.447 --> 10:22.148
Yes.

10:22.182 --> 10:23.216
Are they frozen?

10:23.250 --> 10:25.018
I freeze them, yeah.

10:25.051 --> 10:26.620
He says they taste like
they're frozen, that's all.

10:26.653 --> 10:27.954
Really?
Yeah.

10:27.988 --> 10:30.000
him.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.423
him.

10:30.457 --> 10:31.825
They are frozen.
Mm-hmm.

10:31.858 --> 10:34.227
Damn.

10:34.261 --> 10:37.097
More parsley.

10:42.002 --> 10:42.969
Soggy.

10:43.003 --> 10:44.704
Strange taste inside.

10:44.738 --> 10:46.373
They're definitely not fresh.

10:46.406 --> 10:48.441
Uh, on that Cajun salmon,

10:48.475 --> 10:51.244
do you still want
the sautéed spinach

10:51.278 --> 10:52.746
and the pesto?

10:52.779 --> 10:55.148
Yeah.

11:01.988 --> 11:02.956
What is that?

11:02.989 --> 11:04.391
That is pesto.

11:04.424 --> 11:05.492
Is it good?

11:07.227 --> 11:08.361
I have no idea.

11:09.796 --> 11:11.231
Yeah, it's never on the side.

11:11.264 --> 11:12.866
It's usually
served on the fish.

11:12.899 --> 11:14.801
When I served him
the salmon,

11:14.834 --> 11:16.336
he did have something
to say about the pesto sauce.

11:16.369 --> 11:18.805
It was tainted.

11:18.838 --> 11:20.040
So to speak.

11:22.008 --> 11:23.877
The salmon
is just solid inside

11:23.910 --> 11:26.713
and dry.

11:26.746 --> 11:29.049
God.

11:29.082 --> 11:30.000
You can't expect
customers to come

11:30.000 --> 11:30.951
You can't expect
customers to come

11:30.984 --> 11:32.085
and pay for that.

11:34.688 --> 11:37.691
You definitely have to try
my homemade Greek cookies.

11:37.724 --> 11:40.527
And I bet you you're gonna say
you never had a better one.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.196
Oh, Chef Ramsay,
he's a lot like me.

11:43.229 --> 11:44.197
I love him.

11:44.230 --> 11:45.565
When you eat that cookie,

11:45.598 --> 11:46.666
you life it up
and you bite.

11:56.276 --> 11:58.445
me.

11:58.478 --> 11:59.980
I'm surprised you guys
are still alive.

12:01.381 --> 12:02.882
He just choked
on your mother's cookie.

12:02.916 --> 12:03.883
Oop.

12:03.917 --> 12:05.218
I don't have an answer.

12:05.251 --> 12:06.820
I don't.

12:13.526 --> 12:15.662
Before Gordon
passes on his comments

12:15.695 --> 12:17.597
to the chef
and the owners,

12:17.630 --> 12:19.632
he decides to observe
a dinner service

12:19.666 --> 12:21.468
to get a more
complete picture

12:21.501 --> 12:23.570
of the problems
in the restaurant.

12:23.603 --> 12:26.406
In New England,
clam chowder smells fishy.

12:35.382 --> 12:36.716
Sure, sure.
Whatever you'd like.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.318
Yeah, it's a little cold.

12:38.351 --> 12:39.786
I'm telling the truth,
it's cold.

12:39.819 --> 12:40.787
It is cold.

12:40.820 --> 12:42.689
This is so sad.

12:42.722 --> 12:44.090
So ing sad.

12:44.124 --> 12:45.191
With customers complaining

12:45.225 --> 12:46.459
in the restaurant,

12:46.493 --> 12:49.262
Gordon looks to the owner
to solve the problems.

12:49.295 --> 12:51.698
Sir, like I said,
if you think I scam,

12:51.731 --> 12:54.367
do me a favor,
do what you gotta do.

12:54.401 --> 12:56.136
But I would appreciate
one thing

12:56.169 --> 12:57.303
before you make
the phone call...

12:57.337 --> 12:58.438
Not in front
of the customers.

12:59.739 --> 13:00.000
ing hell.
My God!

13:00.000 --> 13:02.542
ing hell.
My God!

13:02.575 --> 13:04.444
Oh, my.

13:04.477 --> 13:06.479
After being disappointed

13:06.513 --> 13:08.281
with the front
of the house,

13:08.314 --> 13:09.816
it was time to check out
the engine room

13:09.849 --> 13:10.850
of the restaurant,

13:10.884 --> 13:12.986
the kitchen.

13:13.019 --> 13:14.487
Doug?
Yes.

13:14.521 --> 13:15.855
He said this is cold.

13:15.889 --> 13:17.557
And feel the plate,
it is cold.

13:20.860 --> 13:23.463
Hey guys,
the plates are stone cold.

13:23.496 --> 13:25.832
If the plate was cold,
would you take it out, Diane?

13:25.865 --> 13:27.400
Yeah.
You would.

13:27.434 --> 13:28.501
They put it up,
I take it.

13:28.535 --> 13:29.936
me.

13:29.969 --> 13:30.000
No, it's all right.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.237
No, it's all right.

13:31.271 --> 13:32.372
I don't worry about it.

13:34.441 --> 13:35.809
What's your fascination

13:35.842 --> 13:37.944
with all the parsley
on the plate?

13:37.977 --> 13:40.213
I just happen to--way
like the parsley looks

13:40.246 --> 13:41.915
to be honest with ya.

13:41.948 --> 13:44.584
It stinks.
It's dried parsley.

13:44.617 --> 13:46.419
It's a sign
of a dated restaurant.

13:46.453 --> 13:47.954
Sprinkle it on your wife,

13:47.987 --> 13:49.556
but not on
the ing plates.

13:49.589 --> 13:51.357
He may not
like the way I cook.

13:51.391 --> 13:52.625
He doesn't like
the way I cook,

13:52.659 --> 13:53.793
that's his opinion.

13:55.628 --> 13:56.596
Oops.

13:56.629 --> 13:58.031
Oh, God.

14:01.601 --> 14:03.970
Why aren't
they cleaning it?

14:05.672 --> 14:07.540
This is extraordinary.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.710
Stop there.
Come here.

14:10.743 --> 14:11.945
How the

14:11.978 --> 14:13.346
can you walk past
that ,

14:13.379 --> 14:14.981
pay them to work in it?

14:16.182 --> 14:17.917
I meet he just spilled
a bucket--

14:17.951 --> 14:20.720
a bucket of
tomato sauce.

14:20.753 --> 14:22.789
Why can't you
say something to him

14:22.822 --> 14:25.291
about cleaning up his mess?

14:25.325 --> 14:27.560
Oh.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.000
Chef Doug does not
listen to a word I say.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.398
Chef Doug does not
listen to a word I say.

14:32.432 --> 14:34.033
And sometimes
I'm not in the mood.

14:34.067 --> 14:36.636
What is going on?

14:36.669 --> 14:38.438
Oh, now he's got a mop.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.243
Peter!

14:43.276 --> 14:44.878
Peter!
One second.

14:44.911 --> 14:46.846
Did you hear what I said?

14:46.880 --> 14:48.214
I heard you.

14:48.248 --> 14:50.150
I didn't ask you to go
mop up their.

14:52.585 --> 14:54.053
Oh, God almighty.

14:54.087 --> 14:55.421
That's not
the right answer, but...

14:55.455 --> 14:57.724
What a sad.

14:58.825 --> 15:00.000
Can I clean it now?

15:00.000 --> 15:00.960
Can I clean it now?

15:03.463 --> 15:06.866
While Peter cleans up
the mess on the floor...

15:06.900 --> 15:09.335
When was the last time
this place was clean?

15:09.369 --> 15:11.104
Gordon realizes that this

15:11.137 --> 15:13.173
is part of a bigger problem.

15:17.644 --> 15:18.778
Oh, my God!

15:18.811 --> 15:19.979
Coming up...

15:20.013 --> 15:21.447
This is disgusting!

15:21.481 --> 15:23.249
Gordon gets up early
to investigate.

15:23.283 --> 15:24.784
You'll kill whatever customers

15:24.817 --> 15:25.985
we've got left.

15:26.019 --> 15:27.387
But what he finds

15:27.420 --> 15:28.821
makes him wish
he'd never got up.

15:28.855 --> 15:30.000
Look at that.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.390
Look at that.

15:30.423 --> 15:32.192
You didn't see that?
I didn't see it.

15:32.225 --> 15:33.993
I've eaten it!

15:34.027 --> 15:36.696
And owners Peter and Irene
suffer the consequences.

15:36.729 --> 15:38.198
I'm closing it down!

15:38.231 --> 15:40.099
Nothing's being cooked
in here this evening.

15:40.133 --> 15:40.967
Coming up on
Kitchen Nightmares.

15:55.325 --> 15:58.228
Before the staff comes in
to prepare for lunch,

15:58.261 --> 16:00.197
Gordon arrives early

16:00.230 --> 16:02.733
to do a thorough investigation
of the kitchen.

16:02.766 --> 16:04.167
Oh, God!

16:05.369 --> 16:06.570
What is that?

16:06.603 --> 16:08.605
Twice-baked potato.

16:08.638 --> 16:11.475
Thank  I missed
that one twice.

16:11.508 --> 16:13.543
Oh,.

16:13.577 --> 16:14.578
So dirty.

16:14.611 --> 16:15.611
God, when was that cleaned?

16:15.611 --> 16:18.315
God, when was that cleaned?

16:18.348 --> 16:20.217
Oh, my God.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.252
What is that?

16:22.285 --> 16:24.221
This is 10,000 times worse

16:24.254 --> 16:25.756
than I thought it would be.

16:30.460 --> 16:34.264
Looks like larva..

16:34.297 --> 16:35.465
And crap.

16:35.499 --> 16:37.868
Kitchen health hazard.

16:37.901 --> 16:39.536
Bingo.

16:39.569 --> 16:43.507
My fresh lobster ravioli.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.611
Soggy, strange taste
inside.

16:45.611 --> 16:46.810
Soggy, strange taste
inside.

16:46.843 --> 16:48.812
Fresh...

16:48.845 --> 16:49.980
my ing ass.

16:50.013 --> 16:52.382
I've eaten this!

16:52.416 --> 16:56.686
The general hygiene
in refrigeration--

16:56.720 --> 16:58.955
oh  hell.

16:58.989 --> 17:02.826
So that's the pesto
I had for lunch.

17:06.229 --> 17:08.765
Just look at the colors
in there.

17:08.799 --> 17:10.600
Look at that!

17:10.634 --> 17:12.335
It's moldy.

17:16.740 --> 17:18.108
It's now lunch time.

17:18.141 --> 17:19.543
The chefs are preparing.

17:19.576 --> 17:21.211
Customers are getting ready
to eat,

17:21.244 --> 17:23.046
but Gordon steps in.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.581
Can I just have a quick word

17:24.614 --> 17:25.315
with both of you,
two seconds?

17:25.348 --> 17:26.383
No problem.
Yeah?

17:26.416 --> 17:27.551
When was the last time

17:27.584 --> 17:28.618
you went in the kitchen

17:28.652 --> 17:30.821
and had a little look around?

17:30.854 --> 17:32.489
Once every Tuesday or so
we'll go in

17:32.522 --> 17:33.824
and we'll all scrub
them down.

17:33.857 --> 17:37.694
God, when was that cleaned?

17:37.727 --> 17:40.397
Irene, you mentioned earlier

17:40.430 --> 17:43.433
about how clean
this place was.
Right.

17:43.467 --> 17:44.901
The board of health came here

17:44.935 --> 17:45.611
and believe me,
they gave us 95.

17:45.611 --> 17:46.136
and believe me,
they gave us 95.

17:46.169 --> 17:47.671
So the place is clean.

17:47.704 --> 17:49.806
That's 95 out of 100.
Right.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.342
I really don't think
you've got any idea.

17:53.810 --> 17:55.378
Can I just take you in there?

17:55.412 --> 17:56.413
Sure, come on,
let's go.

17:57.881 --> 17:58.849
Yeah.

17:58.882 --> 17:59.950
You just stop.

17:59.983 --> 18:01.218
Charles, stop what you're doing.

18:01.251 --> 18:02.452
Okay.

18:02.486 --> 18:04.187
Are you aware how filthy
your kitchen is?

18:06.790 --> 18:08.492
How dare you cook me a lunch

18:08.525 --> 18:09.993
out of this kitchen
knowing full well

18:10.026 --> 18:11.895
how filthy your kitchen is.

18:11.928 --> 18:14.564
So you don't even walk
behind the line?

18:14.598 --> 18:15.611
Look at under here!

18:15.611 --> 18:17.133
Look at under here!

18:17.167 --> 18:18.668
Come here two seconds.

18:18.702 --> 18:20.036
Peter, get your ing
hand under there!

18:20.070 --> 18:21.705
Doug, look under there!

18:21.738 --> 18:23.139
Why have you got product
in there?

18:23.173 --> 18:24.741
Why are you using it?

18:24.774 --> 18:26.543
Why is not condemned?

18:26.576 --> 18:29.346
To have another chef
in my face about my kitchen,

18:29.379 --> 18:31.047
I'm pissed off,
believe me.

18:31.081 --> 18:33.149
Even the croutons gone moldy.

18:33.183 --> 18:34.150
Oh, my God.

18:34.184 --> 18:35.218
Would you eat that?

18:35.252 --> 18:37.153
No.

18:37.187 --> 18:38.388
Let's go in the walk-in fridge.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.357
I'm amazed how--

18:40.390 --> 18:41.925
I'm amazed how you're so cool

18:41.958 --> 18:43.193
and chilled at this,
you know that?

18:45.462 --> 18:45.611
That's the fish bag.

18:45.611 --> 18:46.796
That's the fish bag.

18:46.830 --> 18:47.597
It's what?

18:47.631 --> 18:50.033
God!

18:50.066 --> 18:52.102
Actually, that was for me,
actually.

18:52.135 --> 18:53.403
That's for you?

18:53.436 --> 18:54.504
Don't eat it.

18:54.538 --> 18:56.506
Don't ing eat it!

18:56.540 --> 18:58.208
I already have.
You've eaten it!

18:58.241 --> 18:59.609
Smell that there.

18:59.643 --> 19:01.111
Smells sour.

19:02.379 --> 19:03.747
Are you ing mad?

19:03.780 --> 19:05.215
Sour on the outside?

19:05.248 --> 19:07.117
Oh, come on!
It's pork!

19:07.150 --> 19:09.152
The pork was mine.

19:09.185 --> 19:11.054
That's my--
that's my personal meal.

19:11.087 --> 19:12.889
Oh,  hell.

19:12.923 --> 19:15.611
I didn't expect this kind
of a mess that I see.

19:15.611 --> 19:15.725
I didn't expect this kind
of a mess that I see.

19:15.759 --> 19:17.060
I'm very upset.

19:17.093 --> 19:18.628
I mean, that's the only way
to put it

19:18.662 --> 19:19.863
Very disappointed.
Very upset.

19:19.896 --> 19:21.731
What's this?

19:21.765 --> 19:23.500
That's a chicken valdostano.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.535
Does that look half cooked?
Started to be cooked?

19:25.569 --> 19:26.870
Thank you.

19:26.903 --> 19:28.905
I'm just not a throw-away
person.

19:28.939 --> 19:30.307
That was cooked on Friday

19:30.340 --> 19:31.308
and I had to recook it
Saturday.

19:31.341 --> 19:32.509
That's what you gotta do.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.145
You'll kill whatever customers
we've got left!

19:36.646 --> 19:38.214
What have you
got to say about it

19:38.248 --> 19:39.916
as someone that owns
the place?

19:39.950 --> 19:42.085
When it comes
to the freshness of the food,

19:42.118 --> 19:44.654
that really falls
on just the chef alone.

19:44.688 --> 19:45.611
Can we get out of here?

19:45.611 --> 19:46.289
Can we get out of here?

19:46.323 --> 19:48.124
It's his name;
it's fully his fault.

19:48.158 --> 19:50.894
Get me the bowl of pesto
please, Charles.

19:50.927 --> 19:52.896
What was my main course
in there yesterday?

19:52.929 --> 19:53.897
You had a Cajun salmon.

19:53.930 --> 19:54.931
That's right.

19:54.965 --> 19:56.299
What was the sauce?

19:56.333 --> 19:58.501
The sauce was a pesto sauce.

19:58.535 --> 19:59.669
Bring it over please.

20:00.804 --> 20:02.772
You're right.

20:02.806 --> 20:04.207
You didn't seethat?

20:04.240 --> 20:05.942
I didn't see that.
I-I--

20:05.976 --> 20:07.410
You got glasses on there,
man.

20:07.444 --> 20:08.612
The pesto sauce--

20:08.645 --> 20:10.113
that was not forgivable.

20:10.146 --> 20:13.149
I'm humiliated about that,
believe me.

20:13.183 --> 20:15.318
Positively, positively.

20:15.352 --> 20:15.611
Now this is not a time,
hey--

20:15.611 --> 20:18.054
Now this is not a time,
hey--

20:18.088 --> 20:19.823
to laugh and take
the ing piss out of me.

20:19.856 --> 20:22.692
I've eaten this!

20:22.726 --> 20:24.427
What's going on, Peter?

20:24.461 --> 20:27.931
I'm surprised that Gordon
didn't make him eat it.

20:27.964 --> 20:29.799
And this is scrubbed
every Tuesday?

20:29.833 --> 20:32.002
- Oh!
- every ing week?

20:32.035 --> 20:33.903
You've got the nerve
to tell me

20:33.937 --> 20:36.106
that you clean the walls
every ing Tuesday?

20:36.139 --> 20:37.540
Touch--
off, will you?

20:37.574 --> 20:39.843
Touch the wall,
you dirty pig!

20:39.876 --> 20:42.579
This is disgusting.

20:42.612 --> 20:44.381
I'm closing it down.
How many's booked?

20:44.414 --> 20:45.611
About twenty.
Twenty?
Forget it.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.050
About twenty.
Twenty?
Forget it.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.855
Get the place steam-cleaned

20:51.888 --> 20:53.456
from
head to tail.

20:53.490 --> 20:54.958
I don't care,
but we're not cooking

20:54.991 --> 20:57.827
a  cookie
out of here!

20:57.861 --> 20:58.962
Marilyn, Marilyn--

20:58.995 --> 21:00.130
Yes, sir?

21:00.163 --> 21:01.798
Nothing's coming out
of this kitchen.

21:01.831 --> 21:03.466
Okay, fine.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.068
When Chef Ramsay
shut down the restaurant

21:05.101 --> 21:06.836
it was shocking, of course.

21:06.870 --> 21:08.304
And his face was all red.

21:08.338 --> 21:10.707
Chef Ramsay--
he was really upset.

21:10.740 --> 21:13.443
Okay, should I tell
the customers outside to leave?

21:13.476 --> 21:14.477
Please.

21:15.979 --> 21:19.149
Switch it off.
We're going down now.

21:20.684 --> 21:22.118
Okay, thank you for coming.

21:22.152 --> 21:23.553
But the Chef Ramsay,

21:23.586 --> 21:26.289
actually he wants to open up
tomorrow.

21:26.322 --> 21:28.191
All my years,
we never shut up a kitchen

21:28.224 --> 21:29.492
and tell the customers
to go home, never.

21:29.526 --> 21:31.261
And that--
that's an embarrassment.

21:34.330 --> 21:36.132
Why don't you clean
when you're quiet?

21:36.166 --> 21:38.368
I stay busy all day
from 11:00

21:38.401 --> 21:39.736
when I walk in the door

21:39.769 --> 21:40.603
until 5:30-6:00
when we get tables.

21:40.637 --> 21:41.805
Doing what?

21:41.838 --> 21:45.611
Doing preparation
every day by myself.

21:45.611 --> 21:46.076
Doing preparation
every day by myself.

21:46.109 --> 21:47.977
Gordon Ramsay can go off
on somebody

21:48.011 --> 21:49.713
for absolutely no reason.

21:49.746 --> 21:51.848
It's impossible
to clean everything.

21:51.881 --> 21:53.249
He just doesn't get it.

21:53.283 --> 21:54.651
What do you find
so funny, Charlie?

21:54.684 --> 21:56.519
What do you find--

21:56.553 --> 21:57.854
What's funny for you?

22:00.824 --> 22:02.125
"What do you want me to do?"

22:02.158 --> 22:03.760
I don't know
what you want--

22:03.793 --> 22:05.361
Kiss your ass and say
I think you're doing

22:05.395 --> 22:06.429
a great job cleaning
on Tuesday nights

22:06.463 --> 22:07.097
when you ing sat
on your crack

22:07.130 --> 22:07.897
doing  all?

22:07.931 --> 22:09.532
Are you gonna do anything

22:09.566 --> 22:11.835
or are you gonna stand there
and stare at me?

22:17.707 --> 22:19.375
Is that your weakness?

22:19.409 --> 22:21.978
You don't know
how to run staff.

22:22.011 --> 22:23.613
This is what I keep telling you.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.014
That's what I keep telling you
all this time.

22:25.048 --> 22:26.182
Tell him
to shut the  up.

22:26.216 --> 22:27.884
Tell him to get out of here.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.152
Close the ing doors
if you don't like him.

22:29.185 --> 22:30.386
Take charge!

22:30.420 --> 22:31.788
This is what he's looking--

22:31.821 --> 22:33.456
for a man!

22:33.490 --> 22:35.458
And that's what I'm looking
for you to become.

22:35.492 --> 22:37.961
Where's your fire?

22:37.994 --> 22:39.162
This is your mom.

22:39.195 --> 22:40.897
Where's your fight?

22:40.930 --> 22:43.299
You are running a business.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.611
You're lucky
I'm not standing here

22:45.611 --> 22:45.668
You're lucky
I'm not standing here

22:45.702 --> 22:47.103
with a ing writ
on your ass

22:47.137 --> 22:48.138
about being food poisoned!

22:50.640 --> 22:52.976
I've never done that before--
closed down a restaurant.

22:53.009 --> 22:54.811
But that was
a ing nightmare.

22:54.844 --> 22:57.247
"Seascape open."

22:57.280 --> 22:59.215
Close the ing place.

23:10.992 --> 23:14.029
After spending 24 hours
cleaning...

23:14.062 --> 23:15.464
What a difference.

23:15.497 --> 23:16.865
You've got your kitchen

23:16.898 --> 23:18.567
back to where it should be,
yeah?

23:18.600 --> 23:20.469
It's now day four,

23:20.502 --> 23:22.204
and if there's any hope
of relaunching the restaurant,

23:22.237 --> 23:24.706
Gordon has to get through
to the chefs.

23:24.740 --> 23:26.241
Right, Doug.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.009
We'll do a quick special
for tonight, yes?

23:30.812 --> 23:32.814
Served with
some crusty potatoes.

23:32.848 --> 23:34.483
It's time for this
seafood restaurant

23:34.516 --> 23:34.717
to put fresh fish
back on the menu.

23:34.717 --> 23:36.551
to put fresh fish
back on the menu.

23:36.585 --> 23:38.286
Tomatoes, basil,
and justbang.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.621
It makes it
a little more vibrant, yeah.

23:39.654 --> 23:41.089
I've been doing this
for 38 years.

23:41.123 --> 23:42.357
I'm not happy at all.

23:42.391 --> 23:43.792
I think he needs to back off.

23:46.027 --> 23:47.696
It's come down to the point

23:47.729 --> 23:48.497
where I really don't listen
anymore.

23:48.530 --> 23:49.164
Let him do what he wants.

23:50.999 --> 23:52.768
Fresh and fragrant.
Okay?

23:52.801 --> 23:54.403
Can we take it through?

23:54.436 --> 23:56.371
I want Peter, yeah--
and Irene to taste it, yes?

24:00.075 --> 24:01.810
Irene, I want you
to taste that first.

24:01.843 --> 24:02.978
I want you to taste it
as well.

24:03.011 --> 24:04.717
That's a fresh,
vibrant tomato sauce.

24:04.717 --> 24:06.114
That's a fresh,
vibrant tomato sauce.

24:06.148 --> 24:07.115
It's very good.

24:07.149 --> 24:08.216
It's awesome.

24:10.118 --> 24:12.087
You don't want to taste?

24:12.120 --> 24:13.288
No, I'm good.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.624
Taste it.

24:15.657 --> 24:16.792
Taste it, Doug.

24:16.825 --> 24:19.127
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

24:19.161 --> 24:21.263
I didn't try the fish
that Gordon had made

24:21.296 --> 24:24.032
because I basically know
what striped bass tastes like.

24:24.065 --> 24:27.869
If you are a chef
with 38 years experience

24:27.903 --> 24:30.639
just tell me why
you didn't want to taste that.

24:30.672 --> 24:32.174
I know what striped bass
tastes like

24:32.207 --> 24:33.074
and I'm familiar with this.

24:33.108 --> 24:34.409
Doug, one more chance.

24:34.443 --> 24:34.717
You're sure you don't want
to taste that?

24:34.717 --> 24:35.710
You're sure you don't want
to taste that?

24:35.744 --> 24:37.479
Positive.

24:37.512 --> 24:39.281
He didn't even have
the courtesy of trying.

24:39.314 --> 24:40.849
God, that's the first time

24:40.882 --> 24:43.185
a guy's never tasted my food.

24:43.218 --> 24:44.352
Now I'm seriously insulted.

24:46.721 --> 24:48.356
Now that Gordon
has shown them

24:48.390 --> 24:49.958
how to make the special,

24:49.991 --> 24:52.861
it's time to see
Doug and Charlie in action.

24:52.894 --> 24:55.997
Okay, good.
Off you go.

24:56.031 --> 24:57.899
I don't expect my cooking
to be like his.

24:57.933 --> 24:59.768
I don't expect my bass
to be like his.

24:59.801 --> 25:02.971
At this point
I don't even want to be here.

25:03.004 --> 25:04.506
That's burnt, Charlie.

25:04.539 --> 25:04.717
What are you doing?

25:04.717 --> 25:06.408
What are you doing?

25:06.441 --> 25:08.176
ing hell.

25:08.210 --> 25:10.679
What the  is this?

25:10.712 --> 25:12.614
Can he not cook
a piece of fish?

25:17.452 --> 25:19.454
The fish is cooked to.

25:19.488 --> 25:20.989
There's  piss
all over the place.

25:21.022 --> 25:23.692
Aw, yeah, whatever.

25:23.725 --> 25:25.560
I don't know
how both of you

25:25.594 --> 25:27.128
can even attempt
to call yourselves chefs,

25:27.162 --> 25:28.163
you know that?

25:30.565 --> 25:33.235
Un-ing-believable.

25:33.268 --> 25:34.603
I am so pissed off!

25:34.636 --> 25:34.717
A sous chef
that can't cook fish.

25:34.717 --> 25:36.505
A sous chef
that can't cook fish.

25:36.538 --> 25:38.106
A head chef that's just
moping around, doesn't care.

25:38.139 --> 25:40.342
This is a joke.

25:44.946 --> 25:47.682
I've seen all I need to see.

25:47.716 --> 25:52.888
Your head chef
is lazy, dirty,

25:52.921 --> 25:55.690
and he shouldn't be
anywhere near a kitchen.

25:55.724 --> 25:58.026
He's destroying your business

25:58.059 --> 25:59.761
quicker than you could
ing realize.

25:59.794 --> 26:01.763
Couldn't even be bothered

26:01.796 --> 26:03.365
to taste what I'd cooked.

26:03.398 --> 26:04.717
In 21 years of cooking,
that is a first for me.

26:04.717 --> 26:07.636
In 21 years of cooking,
that is a first for me.

26:07.669 --> 26:09.237
You asked me to come here

26:09.271 --> 26:11.506
to work and fix
your ing business.

26:11.540 --> 26:14.075
I can't do it

26:14.109 --> 26:16.978
with those two schmucks
in there.

26:17.012 --> 26:19.014
You have got to make

26:19.047 --> 26:21.483
the biggest decision
you've ever made

26:21.516 --> 26:24.219
since your father passed away.

26:24.252 --> 26:28.523
Whether you continue to work
with the dead wood

26:28.557 --> 26:31.426
that have drifted
into your business,

26:31.459 --> 26:34.663
or whether you wake up,
get a grip,

26:34.696 --> 26:34.717
and be the boss.

26:34.717 --> 26:36.398
and be the boss.

26:36.431 --> 26:37.599
The one thing that I need you

26:37.632 --> 26:40.902
to carry out for me...

26:40.936 --> 26:42.971
I want you to go
in the kitchen

26:43.004 --> 26:48.610
and ask Doug and Charles
to take off.

26:54.115 --> 26:56.518
Doug got too comfortable
in being lazy.

26:56.551 --> 26:58.119
There's no excuse
for that.

27:00.355 --> 27:03.191
Decision's yours.

27:03.224 --> 27:04.526
And I realized at that moment

27:04.559 --> 27:04.717
that something had to be done.

27:04.717 --> 27:06.428
that something had to be done.

27:06.461 --> 27:07.963
Do you agree with me?

27:07.996 --> 27:09.831
A hundred percent.

27:09.864 --> 27:11.099
Irene,

27:11.132 --> 27:12.901
how does that sound to you?

27:14.803 --> 27:18.340
Fire them.
Fire them on the spot.

27:18.373 --> 27:19.674
That's what I want to hear.

27:19.708 --> 27:20.976
That's what he wants to hear.

27:21.009 --> 27:22.911
They're not good enough
for this place.

27:25.880 --> 27:30.885
*

27:38.693 --> 27:39.794
Are you sure?

27:46.368 --> 27:48.370
I kind of expected it

27:48.403 --> 27:50.538
from the way that we worked
tonight, so...

27:50.572 --> 27:52.240
am I a little upset
about it?

27:52.273 --> 27:53.341
Yeah, I'm a little bit upset.

27:58.380 --> 28:00.548
Right now I'm humiliated.

28:00.582 --> 28:01.983
It's freakin' horrid.

28:02.017 --> 28:03.051
It's horrid.

28:17.425 --> 28:19.060
It's now day five,

28:19.094 --> 28:21.096
and the Seascape
is still closed.

28:21.129 --> 28:24.499
Before Gordon can solve
the chef crisis,

28:24.533 --> 28:26.935
he has to light a fire
under Peter.

28:26.968 --> 28:30.071
So this exercise
is a way that you let go.

28:30.105 --> 28:31.573
Release and let go, yes?

28:31.606 --> 28:32.741
You need that right now.

28:32.774 --> 28:34.376
Release the tension.

28:34.409 --> 28:36.344
Okay, good.
Get in the ing ring.

28:37.779 --> 28:39.047
Are you ready--turn around,
stand in here like that.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.822
I'm there, 1-2-bang!

28:40.822 --> 28:40.849
I'm there, 1-2-bang!

28:40.882 --> 28:42.384
When you release
that third one,

28:42.417 --> 28:43.985
1-2-boom, bang,

28:44.019 --> 28:44.986
you shout and scream.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.688
1-2--

28:46.721 --> 28:47.789
Argh!

28:47.822 --> 28:49.457
Come on, you sack of.

28:49.491 --> 28:50.458
Ah, ah, aah!

28:52.160 --> 28:53.695
I'm not hearing anything
inside you.

28:53.728 --> 28:54.930
You're still holding it in.

28:54.963 --> 28:56.331
Let's go.

28:56.364 --> 28:59.000
Now I can see it, boss!
Come on!

28:59.034 --> 29:00.435
And again, and again.

29:00.468 --> 29:02.671
Come on!
Ah, ah, aah!

29:02.704 --> 29:04.172
I don't know what's happened,

29:04.206 --> 29:05.273
but the last three
or four punches

29:05.307 --> 29:06.675
have been stronger and stronger.

29:06.708 --> 29:08.276
Because I realized
how much of an ass I was.

29:08.310 --> 29:09.344
In what way?

29:09.377 --> 29:10.822
You've been honest
with me.

29:10.822 --> 29:11.613
You've been honest
with me.

29:11.646 --> 29:14.583
I kind of lied to you.

29:14.616 --> 29:17.319
I knew my kitchen was dirty!

29:17.352 --> 29:19.754
I did what I've been doing
my whole life--

29:19.788 --> 29:23.358
keeping the peace
and keeping myself down.

29:23.391 --> 29:26.094
You've got no reason
to keep yourself down, Peter.

29:26.127 --> 29:27.996
My father...

29:28.029 --> 29:29.864
never gave me
a compliment,

29:29.898 --> 29:31.199
told me I sucked,

29:31.233 --> 29:33.168
never could do nothing
with my life.

29:33.201 --> 29:35.437
He was a great worker, yeah,

29:35.470 --> 29:36.871
but didn't give a
about his own son

29:36.905 --> 29:38.640
who cared about him.

29:38.673 --> 29:40.675
I let it destroy me.

29:40.709 --> 29:40.822
He died before
I could prove him wrong.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.410
He died before
I could prove him wrong.

29:42.444 --> 29:43.778
You're doing that now.

29:43.812 --> 29:46.014
Prove him ing wrong!

29:46.047 --> 29:47.315
You're right.
Let's go!

29:49.784 --> 29:52.153
I blamed my father
for my failures,

29:52.187 --> 29:53.421
but it was myself.

29:53.455 --> 29:55.023
Can't blame him no more.

29:55.056 --> 29:56.524
One, two, three.
Come on!

29:56.558 --> 29:57.626
One, two, three.
Come on!

29:57.659 --> 29:58.827
Prove him wrong!

30:01.263 --> 30:02.163
Yeah!

30:02.197 --> 30:04.065
Finally.

30:04.099 --> 30:07.102
How do we get this gym
in the restaurant?

30:09.371 --> 30:10.822
While Gordon was having
a breakthrough with Peter,

30:10.822 --> 30:11.973
While Gordon was having
a breakthrough with Peter,

30:12.007 --> 30:15.877
his design team was remodeling
the restaurant.

30:15.910 --> 30:17.579
Hello, hello, hello.
Hello, hello.

30:17.612 --> 30:18.380
Come in, come in,
come in.

30:18.413 --> 30:19.347
Please, Irene, come through.

30:19.381 --> 30:20.849
Oh my God.

30:20.882 --> 30:22.484
Oh my God.

30:22.517 --> 30:23.885
The color, Irene.

30:23.918 --> 30:25.854
I love it.
I love it.

30:25.887 --> 30:26.921
Definitely.

30:29.557 --> 30:31.793
The red definitely does it.

30:31.826 --> 30:33.561
Look how warm it is.

30:33.595 --> 30:35.030
New wood.

30:35.063 --> 30:37.932
It's absolutely gorgeous.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.968
We definitely needed a change
and thank God,

30:40.001 --> 30:40.822
Chef Ramsay,
you did it all.

30:40.822 --> 30:42.771
Chef Ramsay,
you did it all.

30:42.804 --> 30:45.607
You brought exactly
the old Seascape back.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.775
Even the bar stool.

30:48.610 --> 30:50.945
It gives it back
the old Seascape charm.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.614
Wait till you see it
full of people.

30:52.647 --> 30:54.015
It is gorgeous.

30:54.049 --> 30:55.917
Marilyn, how do you feel,
my darling?

30:55.950 --> 30:57.118
'Cause this must
go back in time for you.

30:57.152 --> 31:00.155
I can't believe the change.
Can you?

31:00.188 --> 31:01.690
I'm overwhelmed.
I really am.

31:01.723 --> 31:03.191
Look at your pictures, Miss.

31:03.224 --> 31:04.859
And to see my picture
up on the wall

31:04.893 --> 31:06.628
makes me feel really good
that I am

31:06.661 --> 31:09.097
maybe part of the history
of this restaurant.

31:09.130 --> 31:10.765
I might even cry.

31:10.799 --> 31:10.822
It looks almost like
the old Seascape.

31:10.822 --> 31:12.734
It looks almost like
the old Seascape.

31:12.767 --> 31:15.070
It has been brought back
to life, definitely.

31:15.103 --> 31:17.038
I think it's wonderful.
I really do.

31:18.173 --> 31:20.275
Uh, Peter and ladies,

31:20.308 --> 31:21.976
tonight is the most
important night

31:22.010 --> 31:23.345
in the history of Seascape.

31:23.378 --> 31:25.280
Tonight, we're re-launching.

31:25.313 --> 31:27.649
I am so thrilled.
I am so thankful.

31:27.682 --> 31:30.685
I never expected this.
Never.

31:30.719 --> 31:32.654
I'm still dreaming.

31:32.687 --> 31:34.556
I'm still dreaming.

31:34.589 --> 31:36.991
With the staff re-invigorated
by the new decor,

31:37.025 --> 31:38.860
the focus now goes
to the kitchen.

31:38.893 --> 31:40.695
How you doing, Scott?
Peter.

31:40.729 --> 31:40.822
After scouring the local
community,

31:40.822 --> 31:42.530
After scouring the local
community,

31:42.564 --> 31:45.600
Gordon has found a new head chef
to replace Doug.

31:45.633 --> 31:48.403
Got the bull by the horns
and  go for it.

31:48.436 --> 31:50.004
Yes.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.240
And with only hours
until re-launch,

31:52.273 --> 31:55.210
it's straight to work
preparing the new menu.

31:55.243 --> 31:57.278
Okay, the tomato
and basil sauce.

31:57.312 --> 31:59.781
Idea behind this is just giving
it a little bit of vibrance.

31:59.814 --> 32:01.850
Nice, clean, fresh flavor.
Yeah?

32:01.883 --> 32:03.985
Little bit of basil.

32:04.018 --> 32:06.187
Don't rush.
Find your feet, yeah?

32:06.221 --> 32:07.589
Yeah, I'm not--I'm fine.

32:07.622 --> 32:09.124
No, I can see
you're nervous.

32:13.161 --> 32:14.929
Okay, good.

32:14.963 --> 32:16.531
We've involved
some of the old classics

32:16.564 --> 32:17.899
from Seascape

32:17.932 --> 32:19.634
and put a modern
interpretation on it.

32:19.667 --> 32:21.636
Okay, let's go through it
together.

32:21.669 --> 32:23.838
Fresh homemade crab cake.

32:23.872 --> 32:25.106
Fresh pesto salmon.

32:25.140 --> 32:26.474
Clam's casino.

32:26.508 --> 32:27.542
Fried calamari.

32:27.575 --> 32:28.977
Surf and turf.

32:29.010 --> 32:31.513
Okay, any questions?

32:33.948 --> 32:36.017
All around,
it's a great menu.

32:36.050 --> 32:37.285
God must've sent him.

32:37.318 --> 32:39.487
I love this stuff.

32:39.521 --> 32:40.822
With the new menu and decor
all in order,

32:40.822 --> 32:41.823
With the new menu and decor
all in order,

32:41.856 --> 32:44.659
the next step
was to turn Peter

32:44.692 --> 32:45.994
into a proper maitre d'.

32:46.027 --> 32:47.962
Peter, Jean-Baptiste.

32:47.996 --> 32:50.398
Jean-Baptiste runs my restaurant
in New York.
Okay.

32:50.432 --> 32:52.834
His parents are from Lyon
and he grew up in restaurants.

32:52.867 --> 32:53.902
Okay.

32:53.935 --> 32:55.570
I want him to spend some

32:55.603 --> 32:57.372
quality time now
in just sort of grooming you.

32:57.405 --> 32:59.073
You're now
getting polished.

33:00.108 --> 33:02.076
First thing is...

33:03.077 --> 33:04.712
Too stiff.

33:04.746 --> 33:06.815
Maybe we can get one
for tonight, don't you think?

33:06.848 --> 33:10.018
I'm not the most
fashion-savvy guy around.

33:10.051 --> 33:10.822
Um, show me how you walk
over on tables.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.954
Um, show me how you walk
over on tables.

33:12.987 --> 33:16.291
A nice flowing motion.

33:16.324 --> 33:17.659
Was everything all right
so far?

33:17.692 --> 33:20.295
This is you walking.

33:20.328 --> 33:22.263
Every time I see you,
he's like this.

33:22.297 --> 33:23.865
Running around like a
baby rhinoceros

33:23.898 --> 33:24.966
trying to have a.

33:26.201 --> 33:28.102
Can you just walk
nice and slowly?

33:28.136 --> 33:29.137
Put your shoulders back.

33:30.672 --> 33:32.307
Nice and slow.

33:32.340 --> 33:35.677
There you go. There--

33:35.710 --> 33:37.612
Nice. And again.

33:37.645 --> 33:38.913
Lovely.

33:44.085 --> 33:47.021
Actually, it's going to be
two seven tops over here.

33:47.055 --> 33:49.190
I gotta prove myself
to everybody, town of Islip,

33:49.224 --> 33:53.661
uh, to myself, to my employees,
to my mother,

33:53.695 --> 33:55.196
to my father.

33:55.230 --> 33:56.998
I just want 30 seconds
with you.

33:57.031 --> 33:58.867
It's a fight
to re-establish this place.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.368
Oh yeah.
I understand that.

34:00.401 --> 34:02.270
My dad passed away
two years ago.

34:02.303 --> 34:04.873
So there's no way
I can talk to my father.

34:04.906 --> 34:07.408
So I feel it's the closest
I can.

34:11.980 --> 34:13.281
That's it.

34:13.314 --> 34:14.849
How you feeling?
Nervous.

34:15.850 --> 34:18.119
Last chance, huh?

34:30.998 --> 34:33.867
Okay, new decor.
New menu. New chef.

34:33.901 --> 34:36.637
And now, I hope,
a new boss.

34:36.670 --> 34:38.138
Speaking.

34:38.172 --> 34:39.973
For the first time
in this guy's life,

34:40.007 --> 34:41.008
he's gonna step up
to the mark,

34:41.041 --> 34:42.276
come out of the shadow
of his father,

34:42.309 --> 34:44.278
prove to his mother
and himself

34:44.311 --> 34:46.180
he's more than capable
of running this business.

34:46.213 --> 34:47.548
Let me have the phone.

34:47.581 --> 34:49.383
No, no, no.
The phone stays here.

34:49.416 --> 34:51.218
'Cause if he doesn't
make it tonight,

34:51.251 --> 34:53.887
he's gonna  sink.

34:53.921 --> 34:55.030
Tonight is the beginning

34:55.030 --> 34:56.290
Tonight is the beginning

34:56.323 --> 34:57.658
of the new Seascape.

34:57.691 --> 34:59.226
Wipe your forehead.
You're sweating.

34:59.259 --> 35:00.928
I'm looking
at the bigger picture.

35:00.961 --> 35:02.396
I gotta prove to my father

35:02.429 --> 35:03.830
that I can control
what's going on.

35:03.864 --> 35:05.098
Completely new menu.

35:05.132 --> 35:06.934
I'll have the, uh,
clam's casino.

35:06.967 --> 35:09.336
I'm having the seared
striped bass.
Great.

35:09.369 --> 35:10.671
The pasta primavera.

35:10.704 --> 35:11.939
Thank you very much.

35:11.972 --> 35:13.440
The wait staff

35:13.473 --> 35:15.542
is revitalized by the influx
of customers

35:15.576 --> 35:17.711
and the new attitude
at the Seascape.

35:17.744 --> 35:19.780
Table five, fire, please.

35:19.813 --> 35:21.815
First ten tables are here.
Atmosphere is electric.

35:21.848 --> 35:23.317
It smells like
a proper restaurant.

35:23.350 --> 35:24.751
Peter now has to get a grip,

35:24.785 --> 35:25.030
understand what's going on,
and host the room.

35:25.030 --> 35:27.187
understand what's going on,
and host the room.

35:27.221 --> 35:30.791
We're looking at probably
about a 20-minute wait.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.426
A hundred customers
were coming at us,

35:32.459 --> 35:33.860
and coming at us hard.

35:33.894 --> 35:35.395
We were swamped.

35:42.269 --> 35:43.537
So far...

35:45.706 --> 35:48.275
Right, Peter. This is where
we need to step up again.

35:48.308 --> 35:50.010
I'm gonna go talk to them.

35:50.043 --> 35:51.478
We gotta step up big time.
Let's go, huh?

35:52.813 --> 35:54.248
me.

35:54.281 --> 35:55.030
With the restaurant packed,

35:55.030 --> 35:56.416
With the restaurant packed,

35:56.450 --> 35:58.185
the new chef
and the veteran waitresses

35:58.218 --> 36:00.420
are about to be put
to the test.

36:02.289 --> 36:03.957
That yours?
That's not me.

36:03.991 --> 36:06.827
Then it must be Diane.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.096
Oh my God.

36:09.129 --> 36:10.697
I'm really pissed off
right now.

36:10.731 --> 36:12.266
I'm gonna have
a heart attack.

36:12.299 --> 36:13.734
These girls aren't used
to being  busy.

36:13.767 --> 36:15.135
Come on.

36:15.168 --> 36:17.704
Okay, this is where
it's really critical

36:17.738 --> 36:21.074
that manager starts running
his bloody dinning room.

36:21.108 --> 36:23.277
Because Peter's restaurant
is now in the.

36:23.310 --> 36:24.811
Orders are getting back up.

36:24.845 --> 36:25.030
The service is starting
to become slow.

36:25.030 --> 36:26.213
The service is starting
to become slow.

36:26.246 --> 36:28.048
Kitchen's falling behind.

36:28.081 --> 36:30.017
Peter, he's got to start
cracking the whip.

36:30.050 --> 36:31.952
The kitchen is so backed up.
I'm so sorry.

36:31.985 --> 36:33.887
It's coming, babe.
It's coming.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.922
I was hoping everything
would go so perfect

36:35.956 --> 36:37.190
and it's just not.

36:37.224 --> 36:38.792
The food's
just not coming out.

36:38.825 --> 36:39.893
I've been waiting
for the entrées

36:39.926 --> 36:43.397
since like 6:00, 6:30.

36:43.430 --> 36:44.865
What's the matter?

36:46.733 --> 36:47.834
And what were they getting?

36:47.868 --> 36:49.336
Pasta and mussels.

36:49.369 --> 36:50.570
Mussels are an appetizer.

36:50.604 --> 36:53.573
Okay, I'll tell him.

36:53.607 --> 36:55.030
Scott.
What?

36:55.030 --> 36:55.442
Scott.
What?

36:55.475 --> 36:57.377
Table three did not get
their appetizers.

37:00.347 --> 37:02.149
That's goes on the back
of the line.

37:02.182 --> 37:03.617
You gotta wait now.

37:03.650 --> 37:05.285
Hold on. Let's get one thing
done at a time.

37:05.319 --> 37:07.087
I fired it a long time ago.
No, no.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.922
When you fired it,

37:08.955 --> 37:11.258
it still goes on the back
of the line.

37:11.291 --> 37:12.959
Peter and the wait staff here,

37:12.993 --> 37:14.628
they're too set
in their ways.

37:14.661 --> 37:16.463
Oh, Scott, when I order
the French onion,

37:16.496 --> 37:17.964
you automatically
make them for me, right?

37:17.998 --> 37:19.032
There's no one telling them

37:19.066 --> 37:20.567
what they can and can't do.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.135
They're just coming in.
They're taking what they want.

37:22.169 --> 37:23.537
They're just grabbing food.

37:23.570 --> 37:24.771
Is that yours
or mine, Diane?

37:24.805 --> 37:25.030
This--this is mine!

37:25.030 --> 37:25.972
This--this is mine!

37:26.006 --> 37:27.507
It's very frustrating.

37:27.541 --> 37:30.744
I can't communicate
when this is too stupid.

37:30.777 --> 37:33.580
Making sure the front
of the house is in sync

37:33.613 --> 37:36.483
with the kitchen
is Peter's responsibility.

37:36.516 --> 37:38.885
And Irene
is losing her patience,

37:38.919 --> 37:41.154
because he's not stepping up
and taking control.

37:41.188 --> 37:43.423
Please, somebody pick up
this food!

37:43.457 --> 37:44.891
My apologies. I'm sorry.

37:45.992 --> 37:47.060
Ma, what do you want?

37:47.094 --> 37:48.862
What are you doing?

37:48.895 --> 37:50.697
I can't believe this hasn't
gone out.

37:50.731 --> 37:52.299
Ma, what do you want, Mom?

37:52.332 --> 37:53.600
Take charge.

37:53.633 --> 37:55.030
Mom, you know how
to rip into me,

37:55.030 --> 37:55.402
Mom, you know how
to rip into me,

37:55.435 --> 37:56.803
for two days saying I'm never
gonna grow up.

37:56.837 --> 37:57.838
Shut the  up.

37:57.871 --> 37:59.673
Well, this is why
I never grow up.

37:59.706 --> 38:01.174
Mom.
You are the boss.

38:01.208 --> 38:02.876
Start acting like one.
Take charge.

38:02.909 --> 38:05.011
Don't do this , Ma.
Take charge.

38:05.045 --> 38:07.881
All the little things
mushroomed into a big thing.

38:07.914 --> 38:10.250
I'm sorry.
We're trying the best we can.

38:11.251 --> 38:12.819
That's the table
just walked out.

38:12.853 --> 38:14.554
Can you find out
where Peter is

38:14.588 --> 38:16.323
and ask what the
he's doing, please, yeah?

38:16.356 --> 38:18.458
I don't know what I'm doing.

38:18.492 --> 38:20.260
Peter. Peter.

38:24.131 --> 38:25.030
My father right now

38:25.030 --> 38:25.365
My father right now

38:25.399 --> 38:26.500
is turning over
in his grave.

38:39.111 --> 38:41.480
It's the big relaunch
of the Seascape,

38:41.513 --> 38:43.348
and the restaurant
is at full capacity.

38:43.382 --> 38:45.050
But with the front
of the house

38:45.083 --> 38:46.885
not communicating
with the kitchen...

38:46.919 --> 38:49.388
There's way too many people
touching food in this kitchen!

38:49.421 --> 38:50.856
My apologies. I'm sorry.

38:50.889 --> 38:53.292
Peter is losing control.

38:53.325 --> 38:56.461
Peter, I need
two seconds with you.

38:56.495 --> 38:59.398
I really want you to
shine tonight.

38:59.431 --> 39:01.266
You've got no idea.
Thank you.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.210
Take control.

39:02.210 --> 39:02.568
Take control.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.102
When you're not happy
with certain things,

39:04.136 --> 39:05.938
get it off
your ing chest.

39:05.971 --> 39:07.873
Think back
to the boxing ring.

39:07.906 --> 39:09.942
I'm not asking you to be vile
and horrible.

39:09.975 --> 39:11.643
I'm just asking you
to run your business.

39:11.677 --> 39:12.911
To not hold it in
no more.

39:12.945 --> 39:14.580
Gordon is 100% right.

39:14.613 --> 39:17.516
Tonight, I gotta prove
to myself, to my employees,

39:17.549 --> 39:19.084
to my mother,

39:19.117 --> 39:21.820
that I'm willing to take
the challenge and be a boss.

39:21.854 --> 39:23.822
You can do it.
Can I ask for one favor?

39:23.856 --> 39:25.657
Of course you can.
Can I have a hug?

39:25.691 --> 39:27.559
A hug? Why not.
Here we go. Let's go.

39:27.593 --> 39:29.528
Let's do it tonight.
Let's go.

39:29.561 --> 39:31.463
Let's do it.
Yes?

39:31.496 --> 39:32.210
We got it. I'll try
and stand up straight.
Okay.

39:32.210 --> 39:33.565
We got it. I'll try
and stand up straight.
Okay.

39:33.599 --> 39:35.234
All right, guys.
We're starting it up.

39:35.267 --> 39:36.735
I know what has to get done.

39:36.768 --> 39:38.337
I might piss
some people off,

39:38.370 --> 39:39.838
but sorry, we gotta get
it done right.

39:39.872 --> 39:41.206
We are making a plan
right now.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.041
Take this off.
There we go.

39:43.075 --> 39:44.743
And make a new one.
Right.

39:44.776 --> 39:46.345
At a critical time in the night,

39:46.378 --> 39:48.714
Gordon's pep talk
has finally inspired Peter.

39:48.747 --> 39:51.516
I asked Jean-Baptiste
to go back into the kitchen

39:51.550 --> 39:53.886
to start and expedite the food
to make the food go out faster

39:53.919 --> 39:55.520
so we can sit
the people down.

39:55.554 --> 39:56.889
Just do me a favor.

39:56.922 --> 39:58.423
Take the order and give it
a new number

39:58.457 --> 40:00.325
and explain to Jean-Baptiste
what it is.

40:00.359 --> 40:01.693
Now you can talk
to Marilyn while she's here,

40:01.727 --> 40:02.210
and I'll find out
from Diane.

40:02.210 --> 40:03.362
and I'll find out
from Diane.

40:03.395 --> 40:03.862
It's what they call
improvising.

40:03.896 --> 40:05.597
Good.

40:05.631 --> 40:07.432
You're gonna get
your four top now.

40:07.466 --> 40:09.067
I'm gonna get her three
top here.

40:09.101 --> 40:11.036
You had gotten
the bar table, right?

40:11.069 --> 40:12.604
Yes. Thank you.

40:12.638 --> 40:14.339
Okay. Here we go.
Finally.

40:16.208 --> 40:19.144
You're on a roll, Marilyn.
You're on a roll, baby.

40:19.177 --> 40:21.780
I felt like I was back
when I first opened up,

40:21.813 --> 40:23.382
when the passion
was still here

40:23.415 --> 40:24.583
when we were moving
and grooving.

40:24.616 --> 40:25.517
Finally got everything
under control.

40:25.550 --> 40:27.352
The flounder
is just...

40:27.386 --> 40:29.655
out of this world.

40:29.688 --> 40:32.210
Considering where the Seascape
was just days ago,

40:32.210 --> 40:32.891
Considering where the Seascape
was just days ago,

40:32.925 --> 40:35.394
the reopening was a success.

40:35.427 --> 40:36.795
Please, take a seat.

40:36.828 --> 40:37.863
Sit down?
Yes.

40:37.896 --> 40:39.631
What a night!

40:39.665 --> 40:41.633
It was only just literally
a few days ago

40:41.667 --> 40:43.335
that this place was closed.

40:43.368 --> 40:45.170
We met the chef today
for the first time.

40:45.203 --> 40:47.139
To put that standard out,

40:47.172 --> 40:48.307
job well done.

40:49.408 --> 40:52.244
Finally, I feel Peter

40:52.277 --> 40:53.779
actually took charge.

40:53.812 --> 40:55.447
So I'm really, really happy.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.215
We know where to work at it.

40:57.249 --> 40:58.684
To get it better. Yes.

40:58.717 --> 41:00.285
But for me,
I know damn well,

41:00.319 --> 41:02.210
customers tonight
will come back.

41:02.210 --> 41:02.287
customers tonight
will come back.

41:02.321 --> 41:03.422
Yes.

41:03.455 --> 41:05.324
You have to seriously
continue

41:05.357 --> 41:06.992
running your business.

41:07.025 --> 41:08.360
Yes.

41:11.563 --> 41:13.131
As the week progressed,

41:13.165 --> 41:14.666
Gordon worked
with the new chef

41:14.700 --> 41:16.168
to come up with a vibrant
new menu,

41:16.201 --> 41:17.636
making sure to introduce

41:17.669 --> 41:19.404
fresh produce
from the local venders.

41:19.438 --> 41:21.206
You are the luckiest owner
in the world

41:21.239 --> 41:22.808
to have this boat
in your back yard,

41:22.841 --> 41:24.176
I'm telling you.
Yes.

41:24.209 --> 41:26.278
Then to endear the restaurant

41:26.311 --> 41:27.779
back into the community,

41:27.813 --> 41:30.515
Gordon created
an annual chowder cook-off

41:30.549 --> 41:32.210
that was judged
by the town mayor.

41:32.210 --> 41:32.384
that was judged
by the town mayor.

41:32.417 --> 41:34.753
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Seascape.

41:37.856 --> 41:39.458
I quite like that little
burning sensation

41:39.491 --> 41:40.692
in the back of my throat.

41:40.726 --> 41:42.060
It's good.
Different.

41:42.094 --> 41:43.829
The winner, Joe Berini.
Well done.

41:46.665 --> 41:50.535
Please come back and taste it
on the menu for dinner.

41:50.569 --> 41:52.137
Scott, the new chef,

41:52.170 --> 41:53.505
whipped the kitchen
into shape.

41:53.538 --> 41:55.173
You're not doing
that table first.

41:55.207 --> 41:56.441
This one right here. Please.
I'm sorry.

41:56.475 --> 41:57.909
Order in. Crab cake.
Two oysters.

41:57.943 --> 41:59.611
And Marilyn brought back

41:59.644 --> 42:01.046
one of Seascape's
old traditions,

42:01.079 --> 42:02.210
tableside flambé.

42:02.210 --> 42:02.781
tableside flambé.

42:02.814 --> 42:05.083
Woo-hoo!

42:07.119 --> 42:09.821
The place was alive
and everybody was smiling.

42:09.855 --> 42:10.822
Isn't it lovely?

42:10.856 --> 42:11.923
Oh, it's wonderful.

42:11.957 --> 42:13.358
If you've got some room,

42:13.392 --> 42:16.028
don't be scared
to ask for more, yes?

42:16.061 --> 42:17.896
Last but not least,

42:17.929 --> 42:19.598
a new respect
has been established

42:19.631 --> 42:21.566
by a mother for her son.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.301
All right, Mom.
Let's start it up.

42:23.335 --> 42:24.936
Okay,
we have a party of six

42:24.970 --> 42:26.071
that they called.

42:28.173 --> 42:29.608
Okay.

42:29.641 --> 42:31.076
So you're leaving us then,
are you?

42:31.109 --> 42:32.210
Yes.

42:32.210 --> 42:32.244
Yes.

42:32.277 --> 42:34.246
It is amazing what he did.

42:34.279 --> 42:37.816
He taught me to stand up
and be the owner.

42:37.849 --> 42:39.718
Love and support, yes?

42:39.751 --> 42:41.086
Love you, man.
Love you.

42:41.119 --> 42:42.587
Take care.
Thank you.

42:42.621 --> 42:44.022
Thank you for everything.
Not at all.

42:44.056 --> 42:45.123
Stand strong,
buddy, yes?
I will.

42:45.157 --> 42:46.825
Up. Yes?
You got it.

42:46.858 --> 42:48.427
One, two, three.
Excellent.

42:48.460 --> 42:50.328
You got it.

42:50.362 --> 42:52.330
I feel very grateful
to Chef Ramsay.

42:52.364 --> 42:54.232
I will never forget
what the man did.

42:54.266 --> 42:57.002
He put his heart
and soul into this place.

42:57.035 --> 42:59.237
He did save us.

43:01.973 --> 43:02.210
Even though Gordon successfully
restored the Seascape

43:02.210 --> 43:04.743
Even though Gordon successfully
restored the Seascape

43:04.776 --> 43:06.278
to its former glory,

43:06.311 --> 43:08.413
Peter accepted an offer
that he couldn't refuse

43:08.447 --> 43:11.316
and sold the restaurant.
