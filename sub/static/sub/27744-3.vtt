[Frankie] Oh.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.354
Isn't it nice to have the house
back the way it was?

01:03.438 --> 01:06.232
[chuckles] Yeah.
Thanks for all your help unpacking.

01:06.316 --> 01:09.486
Be honest, Grace, you knew
I wasn't going to do anything.

01:10.028 --> 01:13.490
I figured it out when I saw
all your boxes were labeled "Grace."

01:13.573 --> 01:16.868
Hey, the ship is pointed the wrong way.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.287
You're pointed the wrong way.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.164
Hi!

01:21.247 --> 01:24.000
Well, look who's here... again.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.253
Just stopped by to get a bucket of sand
for Macklin's school project.

01:27.337 --> 01:30.256
Don't you live by a park with a sand box?

01:30.340 --> 01:32.509
You don't get into Harvard with park sand.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.219
[sniffs] Do you smell gas?

01:34.803 --> 01:37.013
-[Frankie] And here's Bud.
-Again.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.264
Hi, Mal.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.559
What are you doing here...
on a Wednesday?

01:41.935 --> 01:45.605
Wednesday is my day...
to pick up Macklin's sand.

01:45.688 --> 01:49.776
Oh, 'cause I'm pretty sure Wednesday
is my day to bring our moms pastries.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.028
I'm pretty sure Wednesday
is my day to ask,

01:52.112 --> 01:53.822
"What the fuck are you both doing here?"

01:54.697 --> 01:56.324
Wasn't that ship pointed the other way?

01:56.407 --> 01:57.826
-Yes.
-No.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.286
All right, what gives?

02:00.370 --> 02:03.039
-Why are you always coming by?
-I'm here for sand!

02:03.123 --> 02:05.291
And I have cinnamon buns
and elephant ears.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.377
Don't compliment yourself.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.045
-You know what I think?
-Hmm?

02:09.754 --> 02:11.881
I think you're coming by to check on us.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.300
And I think, for once, you're right.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.471
I say we separate them
like they separated us.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.975
Yeah, you take Sandbox.
I'll take Cinnamon Buns.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.479
Let me show you where the sand is.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.984
What should we do, Mom?
You're still living out here all alone.

02:31.067 --> 02:35.071
So, you decided to check up on us
with the subtlety of Scooby and Shaggy?

02:35.155 --> 02:38.408
Forgive me if after your crazy squat
our worries didn't go away.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.701
I feel fine.

02:39.784 --> 02:43.288
I went bodysurfing this morning.
Not on purpose, but it happened.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.956
And look at me, I'm good.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.250
So, stop being so obsessed with us.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.587
Please, just let me get someone
to help you out a few days a week.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.006
You mean, like, hire us an assistant?

02:53.089 --> 02:56.718
More like a fun friend who stops by...

02:57.427 --> 03:00.221
to monitor your blood pressure,
test your motor skills.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.724
You never did understand "fun."

03:04.434 --> 03:07.312
I'm sorry.
Mom, we didn't mean to be so sneaky.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.441
I'll passive-aggressively torture you
about that later.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.446
[inhales]
What is going on at Say Grace?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.199
-Huh?
-What do you mean?

03:19.282 --> 03:21.993
Every time I ask your sister,
she clams up.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.787
Is she doing anything to avoid bankruptcy

03:24.871 --> 03:27.498
or is she'll set fire
to the building and call it a day?

03:28.124 --> 03:30.251
Insurance fraud has been discussed.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.295
I don't need a nurse stopping by.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.505
But I need to know
everything is okay with you.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.132
I have needs, too.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.510
I need to find my bottoms
from when I went bodysurfing.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.721
-[scoffs]
-I must find where Grace unpacked

03:41.804 --> 03:42.639
my weed box.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.141
But you know what I really need?

03:45.225 --> 03:49.270
To be a grandmother again
without you looking over my shoulder.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.064
I'll tell you what.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.609
You do this for me
and I'll do that for you.

03:54.692 --> 03:55.568
Really?

03:55.652 --> 03:59.364
You'll drop Faith off here
every Thursday for Feminist Fridays?

03:59.447 --> 04:02.325
Hashtag, don't let men
tell you what day it is.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.952
Yes.

04:04.535 --> 04:07.080
If someone checks in
and I know you're okay,

04:07.830 --> 04:10.083
then I'm okay with you being with Faith.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.253
Fine. Deal.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.506
Look at us, negotiating.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.049
It's fun, right?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.635
Mm, you still don't get that word.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.389
How am I gonna tell Grace
about our caregiver?

04:24.472 --> 04:26.307
Oh, that's not gonna be fun.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.850
Now he gets it.

04:28.768 --> 04:32.063
Did she at least accept my advice
on how to rebrand my original line?

04:32.981 --> 04:35.441
Yeah... sort of.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.443
Uh... hmm...

04:37.527 --> 04:39.696
She rebranded the price of them.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.864
What the fuck does that mean?

04:43.825 --> 04:48.204
Um... Uh, that she
is reaching a whole new market.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.498
Well, good. Which one?

04:50.581 --> 04:52.250
The one for people who...

04:53.543 --> 04:54.919
wanna save money?

04:55.545 --> 04:57.839
She's dumping my line, isn't she?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.467
Can I pretend to get sand now?

05:02.927 --> 05:04.929

05:06.222 --> 05:07.390
[door opens]

05:10.310 --> 05:11.686
What are you doing?

05:12.353 --> 05:14.272
I'm folding Peter's laundry.

05:14.355 --> 05:18.443
He left it in the dryer with a note
that said, "Please, fold my laundry."

05:18.526 --> 05:21.154
He really is a terrible house guest.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.905
Why are you doing it?

05:22.989 --> 05:24.032
Isn't it obvious?

05:24.115 --> 05:27.201
I'm kissing his ass
until he picks this season's show.

05:27.285 --> 05:30.788
[Peter] Robert? Hurry with my underpants!

05:31.331 --> 05:33.416
And it better be<i> Man of La Mancha.</i>

05:34.042 --> 05:35.126
Come, give me a hand.

05:36.002 --> 05:36.878
Ew.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.674
What a bunch of boner killers, am I right?

05:41.758 --> 05:44.469
I just found out Say Grace
is having a fire sale.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.513
Basically, Brianna's just
giving it all away.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.640
-What is it with that kid?
-[gasps]

05:49.724 --> 05:51.017
Who raised her?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.727
Mostly, a gal named Hildy.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.312
So, what are you gonna do?

05:54.395 --> 05:56.022
I'm gonna set her straight.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.191
Which is what I hope you did with Bud.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.109
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.444
Do you smell gas?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.240
[door slams shut]

06:06.324 --> 06:08.493
She was picked up for shoplifting.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.702
Joan-Margaret?

06:10.119 --> 06:14.165
Apparently, she jacked
a rotisserie chicken from Good Stuff.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.876
That's crazy.
They're so much better at Gelson's.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.757
Poor Joan-Margaret.
Do you think she actually did it?

06:22.840 --> 06:26.511
I don't know. She is full of surprises.

06:26.594 --> 06:30.598
-Either way, she needs representation.
-And you're going to do it, of course?

06:30.681 --> 06:32.600
Of course. I'd do anything for her.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.811
-And?
-And what?

06:34.894 --> 06:36.646
And this gets you back in the game.

06:37.230 --> 06:42.276
So, maybe you're just a little glad
she stole that chicken, aren't you?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.946
Stop assuming my client stole the chicken.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.198
And... maybe a little glad.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.451
[Peter] I'm naked!

06:50.993 --> 06:54.956
Lock down your friggin' play
and get him out of here.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.375
Okay. [panting]

06:57.458 --> 06:59.168
Something bad will happen
in about two minutes.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.880
You're selling off my entire line?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.382
You're a minute-fifty off.

07:05.007 --> 07:10.221
Brianna, by off-loading the old line,
you're cheapening the entire brand.

07:10.304 --> 07:13.766
Mom, I have to move the line
so that I can recoup whatever I can.

07:13.850 --> 07:17.145
And, if you'll excuse me,
I have an unpaid intern to yell at.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.064
-I'm not going anywhere.
-Oh, God, she's squatting again.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.066
You know what I don't understand?

07:22.150 --> 07:25.361
You accept help from your sister
who has no idea what she's doing--

07:25.445 --> 07:26.362
That's awesome.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.782
But you won't accept it from
the person who can actually help you.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.868
But I don't need your help.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.911
Oh, fine. Okay, what's your plan?

07:34.412 --> 07:35.788
Is this about Walden Villas?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.832
Because we never
appropriately processed that.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.000
Let's have a girls' weekend.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.879
Just you, and Frankie, and Mallory,
and I'll stay here.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.674
You know, as I see it,
you have three options.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.926
You can declare bankruptcy
which is not an option.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.220
-You can sell to Lauren--
-Which is also not an option.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.931
Option number three,
you can let me help you.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.767
Help, like, you working here again?

07:56.851 --> 07:59.729
Help, like me saving the company.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.735
Something bad is going to happen to you
in about two minutes.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.908
[groans]

08:12.325 --> 08:15.244
Our first interview is in five minutes.
Where's Grace?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.954
Yeah...
[sighs, clicks tongue]

08:17.872 --> 08:19.123
I didn't tell her.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.127
-Why?
-Because when I do, her head will explode.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.754
And when it does,
[inhales]

08:24.837 --> 08:27.882
...I'd prefer to have
the caregiver already there.

08:27.965 --> 08:28.925
I see your point.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.179
You got a nursing degree
from Northwestern University,

08:33.262 --> 08:36.933
eight years managing a retirement home.
Anything else we should know?

08:37.016 --> 08:38.643
I'm a people person.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.270
Grace hates people.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.399
And obviously I try to be
as un-intrusive as possible.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.195
I'm afraid I'll clash with his aura again.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.238
Again?

08:50.321 --> 08:52.865
Yes. Like we did in the 17th century.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.117
But it's good to see you.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.537
Next time, let's not make it so long.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.455
I can start as soon as you want.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.082
Mom, any questions?

09:01.165 --> 09:02.458
Only one.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.419
Two trains leave the same station
at the same time.

09:05.503 --> 09:09.382
Both are going to Hogwarts,
but only one of them is magic.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.926
Which train arrives first?

09:13.135 --> 09:15.054
-Who's next?
-No one!

09:15.137 --> 09:16.806
You've vetoed every single candidate.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.891
Bud, it's hard.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.519
This person is gonna be in our home.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.146
Grace is just getting used
to me being there.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.399
It's a delicate dance.

09:27.191 --> 09:30.194
Look, Mom, if you're not gonna
take this seriously,

09:30.278 --> 09:32.238
I will find a person for you.

09:32.738 --> 09:36.617
Maybe the problem is
we're hung up on the word "person."

09:36.701 --> 09:38.828
No. A super has to be a person.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.747
[Andrea True's "More, More, More" playing]

09:45.001 --> 09:46.168
Excuse me.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.547
Pardon me, Norman.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.800
Thanks for the laundry, Robert.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.261
Although, I found
a ClingFree in my sleeve.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.554
Sorry.

09:58.055 --> 10:03.894
So, have you given any more thought
to this season's musical?

10:03.978 --> 10:08.107
Yes, I've narrowed it down,
but let's talk about it.

10:08.190 --> 10:12.278
I mean, I know what I think,
but I'd like to hear what I think again.

10:12.361 --> 10:16.324
My first choice opened
at The Biltmore in 1968--

10:16.407 --> 10:18.284
<i>-Hair.</i>
-Very good.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.705
Choice number two,
Andrew Lloyd Webber's gayest--

10:22.788 --> 10:24.206
<i>Cats.</i>

10:24.290 --> 10:26.042
Let me finish a damn sentence.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.045
Can you finish your next one
with<i> Man of La Mancha?</i>

10:29.128 --> 10:30.546
Well, now I don't want to.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.173
Actually, I never did.

10:32.256 --> 10:36.093
Peter, what is your problem
with the best musical ever written?

10:36.177 --> 10:39.388
It's about an old guy
who talks to himself.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.223
I have one of those at the gym.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.977
Don Quixote de La Mancha is one of the
greatest characters in theater history.

10:45.061 --> 10:49.607
And now I'm finally old enough
and delusional enough to play him.

10:49.690 --> 10:53.486
Robert, your voice
is drilling holes in my ears.

10:53.569 --> 10:56.155
I need a completely quiet space to mull.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.324
<i>Cats</i> is calling to me.

10:59.867 --> 11:03.371
Okay, let me just leave you with this:

11:03.454 --> 11:05.456
Cervantes once said, and I quote,

11:05.539 --> 11:07.833
"Those who'll play with cats

11:07.917 --> 11:10.878
must expect to be scratched."

11:10.961 --> 11:13.589
Robert, let me leave you with this:

11:13.673 --> 11:14.840
Peter once said,

11:14.924 --> 11:18.469
"Those who quote Cervantes
in order to get their way

11:18.552 --> 11:21.138
must also expect to be scratched."

11:21.681 --> 11:23.557
Smoke away, Grizabella.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.685
[sighs]

11:27.853 --> 11:29.105
[door closes]

11:29.605 --> 11:32.692
Joan-Margaret, I am at your service.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.568
Tell me everything.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.405
Don't take this the wrong way, Sol,

11:37.488 --> 11:41.117
but I need someone
with a killer instinct for my team.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.452
Are you sure Robert's not available?

11:43.536 --> 11:46.122
Just because he was
the bad cop to my good cop

11:46.205 --> 11:48.999
doesn't mean that I can't also be bad.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.293
Well, you better be good at it.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.422
Okay, let's get to your case.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.633
How did you find yourself
in this situation?

11:57.717 --> 11:58.801
Was it the gambling?

11:58.884 --> 12:02.555
No, it wasn't the gambling.
It was the losing.

12:02.638 --> 12:06.392
So, you did steal the rotisserie chicken?

12:06.475 --> 12:08.728
No, of course not.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.063
I'm not a thief, Sol.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.233
In 40 years, did I ever steal from you?

12:14.316 --> 12:17.153
Well, apart from office supplies,
which everyone does.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.572
Everyone steals office supplies?

12:20.156 --> 12:22.658
That's why I give people
legal pads at Christmas.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.910
I still think it was very thoughtful.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.328
[Norman barking]

12:27.663 --> 12:30.124
That dog is driving me nuts.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.669
He eats my shoes. He won't stop barking.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.214
Shut it!

12:37.298 --> 12:38.883
[barks in a low voice]

12:40.134 --> 12:41.218
Oh.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.095
That's how you do it?

12:43.888 --> 12:45.431
Worked on my husband.

12:46.432 --> 12:51.020
Okay, so what exactly happened
that day at the market?

12:51.103 --> 12:56.192
Well, the same thing that happened
when I got on the wrong bus over here.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.778
I had a senior moment.

12:58.861 --> 13:02.990
And just like I got on the right bus
once I realized,

13:03.073 --> 13:07.161
I was going to pay the store
once I remembered.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.121
-You were?
-Yes.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.373
Haven't you ever had a senior moment?

13:11.457 --> 13:14.126
All the time.
[inhales]

13:14.210 --> 13:18.088
This morning I couldn't remember
the word for "sock."

13:18.881 --> 13:20.299
All I could say was,

13:20.382 --> 13:24.220
"The thing that goes
between your foot and your shoe."

13:24.303 --> 13:25.429
[both laugh]

13:27.264 --> 13:30.643
And nobody should be punished
for getting older.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.478
Thank you, Sol.

13:32.978 --> 13:33.854
[chuckles]

13:36.482 --> 13:37.650
What are you doing?

13:38.859 --> 13:39.944
Oh. [chuckles]

13:40.027 --> 13:41.153
I'm sorry.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.655
Habit.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.287
[door closes]

13:51.956 --> 13:52.832
Hi, Grace.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.668
I'm Toby. You remember
to take your Benazepril today?

13:55.751 --> 13:58.170
-Who are you?
-[speaks louder] I'm Toby!

13:58.254 --> 14:00.840
Did you remember to take
your Benazepril today?

14:01.465 --> 14:04.552
Uh... Frankie! Frankie?

14:05.928 --> 14:09.723
-[stammers] Who the hell is this?
-Ah. This is my pal, Toby.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.267
We met at Del Taco.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.893
Totally hit it off.

14:12.977 --> 14:16.021
[chuckles] No, dear.
I'm your at-home health aide.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.065
-[laughs]
-[Toby chuckles]

14:18.148 --> 14:21.402
-Classic Toby. I love that bit.
-[Toby chuckles]

14:21.485 --> 14:25.072
Frankie. [clears throat]
May I speak with you alone?

14:25.155 --> 14:26.407
Just give her 90 seconds.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.450
You want to die today, Toby?

14:29.618 --> 14:30.828
[stammers]

14:32.288 --> 14:35.749
Why is there
a human pill dispenser in my kitchen?

14:35.833 --> 14:38.586
Because Bud made me go human.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.796
Frankie, what the hell is going on?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.883
Well, the good news is
I'm a functioning grandmother again.

14:43.966 --> 14:48.470
I just had to agree to having
a teeny-weeny-eensy somebody

14:48.554 --> 14:50.472
in our house looking after us.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.516
Are you out of your mind?!

14:52.600 --> 14:55.811
You get to babysit
and I have to be babysat?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.897
It's just Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.398
Three times a week?

14:59.481 --> 15:01.650
Wanna give him Fridays off?
I'm good with that.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.028
I don't want a stranger in my house.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.654
I don't either.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.616
But if we agree to this,

15:09.074 --> 15:11.952
Bud will let me have
my Thursdays with Faith.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.455
I'm sorry. I know how much
this means to you,

15:14.538 --> 15:18.417
but I can't have somebody
that makes me feel old and enfeebled.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.128
every minute of every day,
three times a week.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.463
What would you rather?

15:22.546 --> 15:27.134
Our kids coming by all the time
with elephant ears and buckets of sand

15:27.217 --> 15:31.221
or a caregiver
who we don't need to be nice to?

15:31.639 --> 15:34.308
-You love not being nice to people.
-[scoffs]

15:35.684 --> 15:36.977
I don't love it.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.021
I'm just really good at it.

15:39.104 --> 15:42.775
Give me one more chance
to find someone you won't hate.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.653
Hey, let's sunscreen up, people!

15:45.736 --> 15:47.029
You're fired.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.031
[footsteps approaching]

15:51.116 --> 15:53.243
You're giving me dairy before bed?

15:53.327 --> 15:56.789
I'm sorry. Will it give you
"Impossible Dreams"?

15:57.706 --> 16:01.919
Is there a song from<i> Man of La Mancha</i>
called, "Get the Hell Out of My Room"?

16:03.045 --> 16:03.879
Bu-- Bu--

16:10.636 --> 16:12.221
[crickets chirping]

16:13.639 --> 16:15.641
Ready to crack this case, Norman?

16:19.228 --> 16:21.313
I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were busy.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.649
[sighs]

16:27.069 --> 16:31.031
Wow. You're like wall-to-wall dog.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.918
[sighs] She clearly walks past
the cashiers without paying.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.007
Hold it.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.259
Did you see that?

16:59.268 --> 17:01.311
Even you steal office supplies?

17:02.730 --> 17:03.689
Yuck.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.403
[scoffs] Frankie!

17:09.486 --> 17:10.487
God. [chuckles]

17:12.281 --> 17:13.323
[door opens]

17:15.617 --> 17:17.161
Well, Brianna! [sighs]

17:17.786 --> 17:19.413
What brings you here?

17:19.496 --> 17:21.457
Something you want to tell me?

17:22.249 --> 17:23.542
Anything you want to ask?

17:23.625 --> 17:26.128
I love when you make it
so easy for me, Mommy.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.838
That's all I'm trying to do.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.048
Okay.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.678
[mumbles] I choose option three.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.971
Pardon?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.599
I choose option three.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.060
And which one was option three?

17:41.143 --> 17:43.228
It is not option one or two.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.439
The only way I can see myself doing this

17:45.522 --> 17:47.524
is if I lay down some ground rules.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.027
[clicks tongue]
Such as?

17:50.611 --> 17:51.445
Here.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.739
-Yeah.
-You're gonna need this.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.532
I always need this.

17:57.034 --> 18:00.412
Okay. My office is mine.
My assistant is mine.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.748
If you want to criticize me,
do it privately.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.416
You want to criticize me privately,

18:04.500 --> 18:06.502
do it slow enough
so that I can think of comebacks.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.837
You cannot wear red. It's my power color.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.173
-Are you done?
-No, not even close.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.966
Actually, not true,
I'm pretty close.

18:13.050 --> 18:17.304
You would be a consultant, serving
at the pleasure of the CEO. That's me.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.057
I won't call you "Mom."
I'll call you "Grace."

18:20.140 --> 18:22.643
[scoffs] Been begging you
to do that since you were four.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.437
Last but not least, I get final say.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.524
You're my daughter.
We don't need all these rules. [chuckles]

18:28.607 --> 18:31.568
Need I remind you
of my lemonade stand when I was a kid?

18:31.652 --> 18:33.112
'Cause I set up the entire thing,

18:33.195 --> 18:36.448
made the shitty signs, I squeezed
the lemons, yelled at the cars.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.492
I was having a really good time

18:38.575 --> 18:42.621
until you came in and took over
because of my poor profit margin.

18:42.704 --> 18:46.125
You moved me to a different corner,
you watered down my lemonade,

18:46.208 --> 18:49.795
and then you re-branded it as
"Citrus Breeze" to bring in an older demo.

18:49.878 --> 18:54.299
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. [sighs]
That must have really hurt your feelings.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.843
[sighs]

18:58.554 --> 18:59.721
Yes, it did.

19:02.432 --> 19:06.145
But, as I recall, you had a lot
of dollar bills to wipe away those tears

19:06.228 --> 19:07.980
because my way worked.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.816
But it made me feel terrible.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.318
Did you feel terrible
when you bought that denim jacket

19:13.402 --> 19:14.695
that you wanted so badly?

19:16.321 --> 19:19.616
Never felt right wearing that
because you didn't respect me.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.910
I thought it was
'cause it pulled under the arms.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.203
It was that, too.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.997
But you get my point.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.083
I do. I do. You're right.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.793
We're gonna do it your way.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.504
Thank you.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.006
Mm-hmm.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.758
So, I'll see you tomorrow at 9:00.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.926
We start at 10:00.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.180
Your business is going under
and you start at 10:00?

19:41.263 --> 19:42.389
Yeah, we work late.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.726
Except for tomorrow
'cause I have a dentist appointment.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.519
[scoffs]

19:52.441 --> 19:54.276
[cell phone chimes]

19:57.654 --> 19:59.156
Ignore.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.365
[Bud]<i> Mom?</i>

20:00.699 --> 20:01.825
Shit.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.787
<i>Hola,</i> you have reached
the voicemail of Frances Bergstein.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.372
Mom, you fired Toby?

20:07.456 --> 20:08.498
Boop.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.251
-Mom!
<i>-Okay, fine. I fired Toby.</i>

20:11.335 --> 20:14.630
But he failed his drug test.
He wouldn't smoke with me.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.797
Mom, we had a deal.

20:15.881 --> 20:19.635
I know, but Grace said "no"
and she was right.

20:19.718 --> 20:23.430
All he wanted to do was check
my blood pressure and hand out pills.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.765
That's what he's supposed to do.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.934
Oh, then he's excellent.

20:27.017 --> 20:30.020
But he made us feel
like we were a million years old.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.813
I will find you someone else.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.399
<i>No, I will find me somebody else.</i>

20:34.483 --> 20:39.071
I need to find the right person for me,
and only I know who that is.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.572
Do you understand that?

20:40.656 --> 20:43.200
-I think I do.
<i>-You do?</i>

20:43.283 --> 20:46.078
Yeah. It's like when I inherited
Joan-Margaret from Dad.

20:46.161 --> 20:50.332
Exactly. She was right for him,
but you had to find your own person.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.543
Now, if we can just do away
with that "person" thing--

20:53.627 --> 20:54.461
Boop.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.173
[chuckles]

20:58.257 --> 20:59.591
There she is.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.552
Oh, my, I look a fright.

21:02.636 --> 21:08.141
As you can see, my client has turned
around and is going back into the store

21:08.225 --> 21:10.435
because she just remembered
that she forgot to pay.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.730
With all due respect,
we can't possibly know her intent.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.401
You're right. I'm sure she returned
to the crime scene

21:17.484 --> 21:20.904
to buy sriracha for your very dry chicken.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.489
They can be dry.

21:22.572 --> 21:27.077
Mr. Bergstein, why your client
turned around is purely speculative.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.412
I guess we'll never know,

21:28.495 --> 21:31.623
because no sooner
had my client walked back in

21:31.707 --> 21:36.003
then security shamelessly shackled her
before she had a chance to do anything.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.546
She stole a chicken!

21:38.088 --> 21:39.464
And they're not dry.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.633
She didn't steal anything.

21:41.717 --> 21:45.053
She had what we seniors often refer to

21:45.137 --> 21:47.180
as a "senior moment."

21:48.724 --> 21:51.518
Look, you're going to get old one day.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.187
All of you...

21:54.271 --> 21:55.939
if you're lucky.

21:56.023 --> 21:59.234
And you're gonna put the cream cheese
in the silverware drawer.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.070
You're going to forget
why you walked into a room.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.741
And you might even walk out of a store
and forget to pay.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.952
So, when you start having senior moments,

22:09.036 --> 22:11.079
do you want to be shaken down
for a chicken?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.875
Shame on you for bringing indignity

22:14.958 --> 22:17.169
on a woman who never stole anything
in her life.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.712
Except office supplies.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.172
And everyone does that.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.389
I will never take a yoga class
with Barry again.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.766
He could scream less.

22:31.475 --> 22:35.270
So, that's why we've decided
to end the fire sale.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.190
Oh, Brianna! Right on time.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.233
[chuckles]
It's only 10:00 a.m.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.610
What the hell, Mom?

22:41.693 --> 22:43.820
Oh no, you mean, "What the hell, Grace?"

22:43.904 --> 22:45.739
It is one of your ground rules.

22:45.822 --> 22:46.740
Don't go in here!

22:48.575 --> 22:50.285
I have gone in.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.953
[indistinct conversation]

22:53.205 --> 22:54.998
Turn around. Go.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.333
Walk, walk, walk.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.794
Dude, why didn't you give me a heads-up?

22:59.544 --> 23:01.922
Don't know which one of you will win,
so I'm playing both sides.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.758
Okay, just stay behind me.
Don't touch me.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.969
Flank me on the left.
We are taking back this meeting.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.013
Let's do this.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.515
-[Grace] Thank you so much...
-So.

23:11.598 --> 23:13.100
...this has been really productive.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.394
And Margie, you are hysterical.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.437
I adore you.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.190
So good to get an early start.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.116
Who is Margie?

23:32.244 --> 23:33.954
[door closes]

23:35.664 --> 23:37.874
Hey, hey, hey. What happened?

23:37.958 --> 23:41.628
You'll be relieved to know Joan-Margaret
won't be eating her chicken behind bars.

23:41.711 --> 23:44.172
Fantastic. Congratulations.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.925
-Eh.
-What? You won your case.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.510
Eh...

23:49.136 --> 23:51.888
Joan-Margaret and I went out to celebrate.

23:53.140 --> 23:57.644
The waiter messed up
and we got a free dessert.

23:57.727 --> 24:00.772
And then Joan-Margaret
told them it was my birthday

24:00.856 --> 24:02.858
-and we got another free dessert.
-[chuckles]

24:02.941 --> 24:04.609
So you've got an upset stomach?

24:04.693 --> 24:05.777
Eh...

24:06.736 --> 24:08.029
I don't know.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.950
Do you feel like you just
don't have it anymore?

24:12.033 --> 24:14.077
-No, I was really good in there today.
-Mm-hmm.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.956
It just... didn't feel the same.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.333
It didn't feel like me anymore.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.503
Remember when I couldn't
imagine myself retiring?

24:23.587 --> 24:27.924
Now, I can't remember
why I loved it in the first place.

24:28.717 --> 24:32.345
You'll find you something else to love.
I know you will.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.724
-Hey, you still love wine, right?
-Well, yeah.

24:35.807 --> 24:39.352
Let's open a bottle and cuddle up
and watch an old movie tonight?

24:39.436 --> 24:41.646
-I do love our depressed nights.
-[laughs]

24:43.523 --> 24:46.443
Robert, I'm done mulling.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.737
I thought you were done being here.

24:48.820 --> 24:52.073
Uh... we're
kind of in the middle of something.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.618
Oh, okay, I'll go tell someone else

24:54.701 --> 24:58.455
the New Lear Theater Company
is doing<i> Man of La Mancha.</i>

24:58.538 --> 24:59.623
No!

24:59.706 --> 25:01.500
-Yes! [chuckles]
-Yes!

25:02.751 --> 25:04.169
[Robert] What made you decide?

25:04.252 --> 25:05.545
Well, I was just thinking

25:05.629 --> 25:09.090
you ruined my marriage
and you've been an inconsiderate host,

25:09.174 --> 25:11.218
but you did let me stay here,

25:11.301 --> 25:12.594
-so I owed you something.
-[scoffs]

25:13.136 --> 25:16.431
So, come on, let's go out
and celebrate me... on you.

25:16.515 --> 25:20.268
Well, I'd love to,
but actually we're staying in

25:20.352 --> 25:22.979
to celebrate Sol's depression. [chuckles]

25:23.438 --> 25:24.731
Isn't that every night here?

25:25.357 --> 25:28.068
You go out and have a good time,
Don Quixote.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.862
I'd be no fun anyway.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.906
I can't leave you here alone.

25:32.989 --> 25:33.990
[Norman whimpers]

25:37.160 --> 25:38.245
Oh.

25:39.621 --> 25:40.497
[laughs]

25:42.374 --> 25:44.125
I am not alone.

25:45.961 --> 25:51.174
"Move this again and I will delete
all of your<i> Ray Donovans."</i>

25:51.258 --> 25:52.676
[chuckles]

25:52.884 --> 25:54.052
You wouldn't dare.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.471
Oh, oh.

25:57.639 --> 25:58.473
Try me.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.808
Step away from the remote.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.643
Step away from the ship.

26:02.185 --> 26:05.272
What are the odds
you picked up the right remote?

26:05.355 --> 26:06.773
Do you feel lucky?

26:13.655 --> 26:14.656
[sighs]

26:14.739 --> 26:18.159
No more standoffs.
I've had enough of that at Say Grace.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.786
[inhales]
Oh, by the way,

26:19.869 --> 26:22.122
how did Bud take it when
you told him how things will be?

26:22.205 --> 26:23.331
He took it very well.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.501
-Oh, good.
-Because I actually hired someone.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.628
-Okay, now I'm not taking it well.
-You will.

26:28.712 --> 26:29.838
Just wait.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.631
Here she comes.

26:32.799 --> 26:33.633
Where?

26:36.052 --> 26:37.304
She's coming.

26:37.554 --> 26:38.471
[inhales]

26:40.223 --> 26:42.309
She'll be here in a minute.

26:46.229 --> 26:48.940
-Joan-Margaret?
-Hello, Grace. [chuckles]

26:50.358 --> 26:54.195
You continue to look just marvelous.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.405
Thank you.

26:55.488 --> 26:56.823
Here you are, my love.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.202
Oh, for fuck's sake,
I've forgotten a spoon.

27:01.703 --> 27:04.080
[groans softly]
Well, back in a jiff.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.251
She's perfect for us.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.794
[softly]
She's not a stranger.

27:09.878 --> 27:12.881
And she won't make us feel old or slow.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.051
And she's actually older than we are.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.345
Isn't that beautiful?

27:19.179 --> 27:20.722
That is beautiful.

27:20.930 --> 27:21.765
Uh.

27:22.390 --> 27:25.310
Well, she's not that slow.
You got your soup.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.187
It's ice cream.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.481
Uh-hmm.
