♪ [String quartet]

01:48.007 --> 01:49.383
[Chatter]

01:49.384 --> 01:50.885
[Frank] Control stacked,
energy-efficient.

01:50.886 --> 01:52.053
Now, mind you,
the whole collection

01:52.054 --> 01:53.512
could probably fit on a Kindle,

01:53.513 --> 01:55.222
but at least the cadets
will have another place

01:55.223 --> 01:56.431
to get out of the rain.

01:56.432 --> 01:58.059
Did you have any input
on the design?

01:58.060 --> 01:59.476
I approved the blueprints.

01:59.477 --> 02:01.228
If something's gonna
have my name on it,

02:01.229 --> 02:02.855
I want to make damn sure
they build it right.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.356
I think my husband
fancies himself

02:04.357 --> 02:05.566
a bit of an architect.

02:05.567 --> 02:07.484
Well, Jefferson
designed Monticello.

02:07.485 --> 02:09.195
And he also fucked his slaves.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.988
Luckily, I don't have any,

02:10.989 --> 02:13.240
so that particular temptation
hasn't presented itself.

02:14.617 --> 02:16.077
The Sentinel...

02:16.078 --> 02:18.413
South Carolina's premiere
military college.

02:18.414 --> 02:21.624
They taught me the values
of honor, duty, and respect.

02:21.625 --> 02:23.543
They also hazed me,
tried to break me,

02:23.544 --> 02:25.378
and, senior year,
nearly expelled me

02:25.379 --> 02:27.338
when I volunteered
for a Senate Race

02:27.339 --> 02:29.006
and my studies suffered.

02:29.007 --> 02:31.884
But that didn't stop them
from soliciting a hefty sum

02:31.885 --> 02:34.095
for their new library
30 years later.

02:34.096 --> 02:36.347
How quickly
poor grades are forgotten

02:36.348 --> 02:38.140
in the shadow
of power and wealth.

02:38.141 --> 02:41.185
Your drink is only
about half as full

02:41.186 --> 02:42.562
as it should be, Frank.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.397
Are you trying to get me drunk?

02:44.398 --> 02:45.772
Drunk, passed out
in the gutter,

02:45.773 --> 02:48.443
so I can steal your wife.

02:48.444 --> 02:51.279
Did you get the email
about the riflemen?

02:51.280 --> 02:53.322
- What email?
- From my office about the invitations.

02:53.323 --> 02:54.532
I was hoping
they would be here.

02:54.533 --> 02:55.742
I'll check the list,

02:55.743 --> 02:57.201
but I don't remember any email.

02:57.202 --> 02:59.328
Oh, not a problem.
I was just wondering.

02:59.329 --> 03:00.829
Well, shit, Frank, I'm sorry.

03:00.830 --> 03:02.415
Don't you sweat it
for a second.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.417
In fact, here's how
you can make it up to me...

03:04.418 --> 03:05.710
freshen my drink.

03:05.711 --> 03:07.336
That I can do.

03:34.363 --> 03:36.407
Congratulations, Congressman.

03:36.408 --> 03:39.285
Remy. Nice to see you here.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.578
Gerry and all the folks
at Sancorp

03:40.579 --> 03:41.870
give you their regards.

03:41.871 --> 03:43.456
Well, I'm sorry
they couldn't make it.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.540
Where's Claire?

03:44.541 --> 03:45.750
Oh, she's here somewhere,

03:45.751 --> 03:47.335
fending off admirers.

03:47.336 --> 03:48.877
Sancorp was very disappointed

03:48.878 --> 03:50.505
she turned down their donation.

03:50.506 --> 03:51.714
I can imagine.

03:51.715 --> 03:53.299
And they're also concerned

03:53.300 --> 03:55.677
about Peter Russo
running for Governor.

03:56.927 --> 03:58.638
Now, how do you know
about that?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.055
Three quarters of Pennsylvania

04:00.056 --> 04:01.932
sits on top
of the Marcellus Shale.

04:01.933 --> 04:04.018
If I can't find out
who's running for governor,

04:04.019 --> 04:06.103
I don't deserve a dime
of what they're paying me.

04:06.104 --> 04:07.896
This watershed bill
Russo sponsors

04:07.897 --> 04:09.816
places a lot of
restrictions on drilling.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.359
Remy, congress is in recess,

04:11.360 --> 04:12.901
and this weekend
is not about work.

04:12.902 --> 04:15.112
I apologize.
You are absolutely right.

04:15.113 --> 04:17.031
Is Sancorp your only account?

04:17.031 --> 04:19.158
I have plenty.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.076
But my other clients
didn't pay for your library

04:21.077 --> 04:22.453
or my plane ticket down here.

04:22.454 --> 04:24.038
It's a nice little junket
for you.

04:24.039 --> 04:26.123
I do hope you're
taking in the sights.

04:26.124 --> 04:27.792
This isn't my first trip
to Charleston.

04:27.793 --> 04:29.335
But I'll bet
it's your first time

04:29.336 --> 04:31.045
not as my press secretary.

04:31.046 --> 04:32.380
It is.

04:32.381 --> 04:33.798
Who else do you have coming in?

04:33.799 --> 04:35.842
I didn't want to pack
tonight too much.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.177
You know, these receptions are
usually just for the money people

04:38.178 --> 04:39.387
like yourself.

04:41.764 --> 04:44.600
Normally, this is where
I would start to drone on

04:44.601 --> 04:47.019
about the Sentinel's history,
its philosophy,

04:47.020 --> 04:48.646
its yadda, yadda, yadda.

04:48.647 --> 04:50.939
- [Laughter]
- But I'm going to save that

04:50.940 --> 04:52.734
for my big speech tomorrow,
and that way

04:52.735 --> 04:54.985
I'm not gonna bore y'all
to tears twice.

04:54.986 --> 04:56.529
Tonight we're going
to turn it over

04:56.530 --> 04:58.781
to a man who needs
no introduction,

04:58.782 --> 05:01.409
because we all know
what a son of a bitch he is.

05:01.410 --> 05:03.494

- Seriously, though,

05:03.495 --> 05:05.454
Frank Underwood exemplifies

05:05.455 --> 05:07.915
all the virtues we try
to instill in our graduates.

05:07.916 --> 05:11.252
We're so proud to call you
an alumnus, Frank,

05:11.253 --> 05:12.712
and to have your name

05:12.713 --> 05:14.797

I first want to thank
Sancorp industries

05:37.153 --> 05:40.448
for providing the funds
to make the library possible.

05:40.449 --> 05:43.659
When I matriculated here
as a young cadet,

05:43.660 --> 05:46.412
Jimmy Carter had just
been elected president.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.414
After I graduated, I wished

05:48.415 --> 05:50.124
that I could have
had another four years,

05:50.125 --> 05:51.751
just like Jimmy.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.461
Well, neither of us
got our wish.

Now it's too dark.

07:31.183 --> 07:32.935
What did you do that for?

07:32.936 --> 07:34.645
Listen, ma, I'm running
for Governor.

07:34.646 --> 07:36.063
I'm going to announce it
in a few days.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.106
That's why I came up to Philly.

07:38.107 --> 07:39.692
There's a community
meeting tomorrow.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.235
I'm going to talk
to the shipbuilders

07:41.236 --> 07:42.653
about a plan
to bring their jobs back

07:42.654 --> 07:44.154
so they'll support me
in the election.

07:44.155 --> 07:45.781

about that stuff.

07:45.782 --> 07:47.199

Okay, listen, there's going
to be some stories

07:53.874 --> 07:55.165
coming out about me
in the news...

07:55.166 --> 07:56.709
about my past.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.044
I just wanted
to give you a heads-up

07:58.045 --> 07:59.795
so it doesn't
catch you off guard.

of Kevin and Sarah?

08:05.761 --> 08:07.386
Too dark to look at pictures.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.221
No, no, no. It's on my phone.
You don't need any...

08:09.222 --> 08:11.849
get it away from me.
I hate those things.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.517
Brain cancer.

08:30.701 --> 08:32.703

do this my...

08:34.121 --> 08:35.456
[man] It wasn't
just up the stairs.

08:35.457 --> 08:37.457
It was up three
flights of stairs,

08:37.458 --> 08:39.293
in the science building.

08:39.294 --> 08:40.419
[Loud laughter]

08:40.419 --> 08:43.005
And Guckenheimer, what he did...

08:43.006 --> 08:45.674
"well, you look lovely
today, Mrs. Governor."

08:45.675 --> 08:47.175
And the thing took a dump.

08:47.176 --> 08:48.970
Right. And they
couldn't get it back...

08:48.971 --> 08:51.680
you can get a cow up
three flights of stairs,

08:51.681 --> 08:53.557
but you can't get it down.

08:53.558 --> 08:55.476
And that's why Andy said...

08:55.477 --> 08:57.645
"who wants steak for dinner?"

08:57.646 --> 08:58.938

08:58.939 --> 09:00.355
How are you boys doing?
- We're good.

09:00.356 --> 09:02.066
- You think I'm fat?
- Take the Fifth.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.610
Seriously, Phil, here,
thinks I got fat with old age.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.488
Ah, you're a big man
with an even bigger heart.

09:07.489 --> 09:08.489
There you go.

09:08.490 --> 09:10.240
She said you're chubby.

09:10.241 --> 09:11.993
Frank, I'm going to go
back to the hotel.

09:11.994 --> 09:13.368
Okay? Have fun.

09:13.369 --> 09:15.079
- I love this woman.
- Yeah, she...

09:15.080 --> 09:16.747
don't let him get
into too much trouble.

09:16.748 --> 09:18.624
They'll have grounds
for impeachment

09:18.625 --> 09:19.667
when we're done with him.

09:19.668 --> 09:21.085
[Laughter]

09:21.086 --> 09:22.670
Better get another drink
before they close up.

09:22.671 --> 09:24.005
You're coming with me
to help carry them.

09:24.006 --> 09:25.506
You're gonna be
a waiter tonight.

09:25.507 --> 09:28.425
Lazy-ass cadet. Lazy-ass cadet.

09:37.936 --> 09:38.978
Complete surprise.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.021
I thought Higgins might have...

09:40.022 --> 09:41.396
no, he played it perfectly.

09:41.397 --> 09:43.273
Made me think
you weren't coming at all.

09:43.274 --> 09:45.442
Are you kidding? We wouldn't
have missed it for the world.

09:45.443 --> 09:48.403
On the library, are they going
to put "Frank" or "Francis"?

09:48.404 --> 09:51.365
Francis. It's the same
as the name above the door

09:51.366 --> 09:52.825
in my office in the Capitol.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.702
"Francis"
is better for libraries.

09:54.703 --> 09:56.328
"Frank" is better
for bumper stickers.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.122
I got a few of those.

09:58.123 --> 10:00.124
Does anybody ever
actually call you Francis?

10:00.125 --> 10:01.583
Claire does.
She's the only one.

10:01.584 --> 10:03.794
She seems like a real prize.

10:03.795 --> 10:05.796
She is.

There's nothing to talk about.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.492
I want to apologize

11:17.493 --> 11:19.161
for when I saw you
last time in Washington,

11:19.162 --> 11:20.370
how I treated you.

Congressman?

37:29.274 --> 37:32.986
Thank you.

37:32.987 --> 37:35.363
I wrote a speech.

37:35.364 --> 37:37.115
But I'm not gonna read it.

37:42.912 --> 37:47.000
Nothing is permanent.
Not even this building.

37:47.001 --> 37:49.211
I don't mean
to sound ungrateful.

37:49.212 --> 37:52.214
I am very grateful.
I'm deeply honored.

37:52.215 --> 37:55.550
And I am...

37:55.551 --> 37:57.426
I'm very moved.

38:06.811 --> 38:10.481
I had the good fortune
of spending most of this weekend

38:10.482 --> 38:12.400
with a group of friends.

38:12.401 --> 38:15.862
Friends I haven't seen
in a very long time.

38:15.863 --> 38:20.909
Friends I made here.

38:20.910 --> 38:23.036
Most of you young cadets

38:23.037 --> 38:26.206
probably, uh,
don't know who I am.

38:26.207 --> 38:30.085
A politician, a name,
a few accomplishments.

38:30.086 --> 38:31.127
But I don't blame you.

38:31.128 --> 38:32.754
When I was your age,

38:32.755 --> 38:36.758
why, I didn't care much
for what men in gray hair did

38:36.759 --> 38:39.928
or what they had to say.

38:43.973 --> 38:46.142
I...

38:47.476 --> 38:50.521
I wish I could describe...

38:59.239 --> 39:03.326
Harmony. That's the word
that stuck in my mind.

39:03.327 --> 39:05.494
Harmony.

39:05.495 --> 39:10.208
It's not about
what's lasting or permanent.

39:10.209 --> 39:16.839
It is about individual voices
coming together.

39:16.840 --> 39:19.426
For a moment.

39:19.427 --> 39:24.347
And that moment lasts...

39:24.348 --> 39:26.515
The length of a breath.

39:30.478 --> 39:33.273
That's what I think
about my time here.

39:38.111 --> 39:39.528
You'll have to forgive me.

39:39.529 --> 39:42.365
I had more than
a few whiskeys last night.

39:42.366 --> 39:44.409
You know, when I was a cadet,
we could drink all night

39:44.410 --> 39:47.287
and then get up in the
morning and march 20 Miles,

39:47.288 --> 39:49.538
but these days I'm lucky
I got up these three steps.

39:49.539 --> 39:53.376
[Laughter]

39:53.377 --> 39:56.045
I wanna thank you very much.

39:56.046 --> 39:57.546
This is a great honor.

39:57.547 --> 40:00.008
I wanna thank president Higgins

40:00.009 --> 40:03.803
and of course
the love of my life, Claire.

40:05.972 --> 40:07.432
Thank you all very much.

40:14.772 --> 40:18.067
- You okay?
- Yes.

40:25.867 --> 40:28.119
[Woman] Nurse Madison,
please pick up line two.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.121
Hi, ma.

40:33.041 --> 40:34.792
This is Christina.
I told you about her yesterday.

40:34.793 --> 40:36.794
- Hi, Mrs. Russo.
- Hey.

40:36.795 --> 40:38.921
We just came by to say goodbye.

40:38.922 --> 40:40.548
We have to catch a train
in about an hour.

40:40.549 --> 40:42.633
Okay.

40:46.637 --> 40:48.056
They still haven't
fixed that light?

40:48.057 --> 40:50.016
Uh-uh.

40:50.017 --> 40:51.559
Things went well today.

40:51.560 --> 40:53.936
I think the folks in the yard
are gonna get behind me.

40:53.937 --> 40:55.230
Peter did a great job.

40:55.231 --> 40:56.523
Hand me that blanket.

40:56.524 --> 41:00.151
The A.C. in here is nuts.

41:04.155 --> 41:06.908
What happened to your hand?

41:06.909 --> 41:08.201
I got in a fight.

41:08.202 --> 41:10.245
Did you win?

41:10.246 --> 41:12.830
Yeah, I guess I did.

41:12.831 --> 41:16.709
That's my Peter.

41:16.710 --> 41:19.795
So you're fucking my son.

41:19.796 --> 41:21.923
Lighten up.
I'm just messing with you.

41:25.427 --> 41:26.719
Excuse me.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.596
[Orderly] Yeah.
Hold on a second. Yeah?

41:28.597 --> 41:30.265
Yeah, my mother's in room 409.

41:30.266 --> 41:31.558
She has a light out
that needs to be replaced.

41:31.559 --> 41:32.683
All right.
I'll take care of it.

41:32.684 --> 41:34.102
Okay, thanks.

41:34.103 --> 41:35.644
Look, babe, if you put
that pink thing on,

41:35.645 --> 41:37.772
I'm telling you...

41:41.359 --> 41:43.361
Hold on. What is it?

41:43.362 --> 41:44.820
The light in my mother's room.

41:44.821 --> 41:46.655
I told you
I'll take care of it later.

41:46.656 --> 41:49.367
No, you'll take care of it now.

41:49.368 --> 41:51.411
- I gotta go.
- [Phone beeps]

41:51.412 --> 41:55.081
And turn the A.C. down
while you're in there too.

41:55.082 --> 41:57.292
Yes, sir.

42:02.671 --> 42:03.923
[Frank] Thank you very much.

42:03.924 --> 42:05.300
[Man] You're very welcome, sir.

42:05.301 --> 42:10.597
[Frank] Take care of yourself.

42:10.598 --> 42:13.933
I'm real proud of you, Frank.

42:13.934 --> 42:16.060
I hate to admit it,
but I feel the same.

42:16.061 --> 42:17.645
[Frank laughs]

42:17.646 --> 42:20.189
Well, having all you here
was what made it special.

42:20.190 --> 42:21.441
Now you stay in touch.

42:21.442 --> 42:23.734
- Will do.
- See ya, buddy.

42:27.822 --> 42:29.991
Beautiful ceremony, Frank.

42:29.992 --> 42:31.909
Yeah, they did a good job.

42:31.910 --> 42:34.579
Your speech.
I'm glad I was here for that.

42:34.580 --> 42:36.498
Me too.

42:36.499 --> 42:38.082
You should come out
to Salida sometime.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.792
I'll take you out
on the Arkansas river.

42:39.793 --> 42:42.170
- I should do that.
- Any time you want.

42:46.257 --> 42:48.050
Yep.

42:48.051 --> 42:50.094
All right.

43:11.491 --> 43:14.243
Francis?

43:14.244 --> 43:15.786
Edward has the car ready.

43:15.787 --> 43:18.623
I'll be right there.

43:18.624 --> 43:20.291
Take your time.

43:48.861 --> 43:50.238
You hear from Peter?

43:50.239 --> 43:52.323
Looks like the shipbuilders
are on board.

43:52.324 --> 43:54.742
Tomorrow morning we start
working on his draft

43:54.743 --> 43:56.661
- for his announcement speech.
- Got it.

43:56.662 --> 43:58.496
And I want the brief
on the mock-up

43:58.497 --> 43:59.622
for the watershed bill.

43:59.623 --> 44:00.915
I got that with me.

44:00.916 --> 44:02.333
Ride with me to the airport.

44:02.334 --> 44:04.960
We'll go through it in the car.
