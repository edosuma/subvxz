00:12.710 --> 00:16.420
Guys! I finally
finished the new song.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.690
- What are you doing?
- Xylo-grilling.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.420
It's a way to combine
my awesome music skills

00:21.460 --> 00:23.360
with Dez's mad cooking skills.

00:31.590 --> 00:33.430
Window burger?

00:35.370 --> 00:37.570
No thanks, I'm
trying this new diet

00:37.600 --> 00:40.340
where I don't eat anything
totally disgusting.

00:42.570 --> 00:46.440
Guess who got a job at
cheese out of my league?

00:47.610 --> 00:49.710
Ooh, the high-end cheese store.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.450
That place is so much better
than cheese just okay.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.750
- Mmm.
- So I just finished

00:54.790 --> 00:56.750
the song for our new Webcast.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.690
It perfectly captures
everything you're about.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.690
Listen. What do you think?

01:04.730 --> 01:07.300
- I love it.
- Yay!

01:08.330 --> 01:09.660
I hate it.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.430
Here.

01:11.470 --> 01:13.400
Try it with my drum chili.

01:15.470 --> 01:18.640
Not the burger. Ally's song...
I don't like it.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.510
Well, maybe my drum chili
will help with that too.

Got any provolone?

02:38.520 --> 02:41.490
This is monterey Jack. Cheater.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.300
Sorry, I'm distracted.

02:45.330 --> 02:46.736
I can't stop thinking
about Ally's song.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.530
The lyrics are so not me.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.500
Well, if you don't
feel like playing,

02:51.540 --> 02:54.470
I'm gonna eat the deck.
These lyrics... out.

02:54.510 --> 02:58.310
"I'm a sensitive guy,
make me cry."D sunsets

02:58.340 --> 02:59.580
I hate sad movies,

02:59.610 --> 03:01.710
and what kind of guy
cries at sunsets?

03:01.750 --> 03:03.480
Buh-bye, Mr. sun.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.250
He won't be back till tomorrow.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.420
Man, I hate this job.

03:11.460 --> 03:14.490
My entire uniform is
made out of real cheese,

03:14.530 --> 03:16.230
including my underwear.

03:16.260 --> 03:19.330
I wear cheese underwear all the time.
I love it.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.660
I really feel like I
can breathe in it,

03:21.700 --> 03:24.270
- especially the swiss.
- Why would you do that?

03:24.300 --> 03:26.640
- Because the goat cheese is too squishy.
- Guys!

03:26.670 --> 03:29.540
What am I gonna do? I
don't like Ally's song,

03:29.570 --> 03:32.240
but if I tell her, it'll
hurt her feelings.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.240
There's only one thing
that you can do.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.710
I never thought I'd say this,

03:35.750 --> 03:39.350
- but Dez is right. Be honest with her.
- Send her a Pickle basket.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.590
- What?
- Ow! What? She loves pickles.

03:41.620 --> 03:44.620
- She also loves honesty.
- Well, I don't have an honesty basket.

03:44.660 --> 03:46.660
I only have a Pickle basket.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.300
I guess I'll tell
Ally the truth.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.730
<i>There's nothing to be afraid of.</i>

03:52.760 --> 03:55.630
Are you screaming

03:55.670 --> 03:58.470
because you are as excited
about the Webcast as I am?

03:59.470 --> 04:01.710
Yeah. You know me so well.

04:01.740 --> 04:05.240
Oh! This is the best
song I've ever written.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.280
- It's perfect for you.
- Yeah, about that...

04:09.310 --> 04:12.220
I need to tell you something.
I...

04:12.250 --> 04:15.450
- guys, a little help.
- Can't talk, got cheese in my mouth.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.420
And I'm not here.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.660
Uh, anyway...

04:24.700 --> 04:27.600
Before I forget, I invited
some friends over

04:27.630 --> 04:29.430
to watch you tape the Webcast.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.670
I wanna see their faces

04:30.700 --> 04:33.600
when you sing our most
awesome song ever.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.340
So what were you gonna tell me?

04:36.370 --> 04:38.640
Uh...

04:38.680 --> 04:41.580
That I got you a Pickle basket.

04:41.610 --> 04:43.580
Oh, thank you.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.680
I <i>like</i> pickles.

04:54.690 --> 04:56.660
Ally, bad news...

04:56.690 --> 04:58.560
I can't do the Webcast today.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.730
- I lost my voice.
- Oh no, that's terrible.

05:01.770 --> 05:04.470
I know. I... I feel awful.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.676
We're gonna have to reschedule.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.370
There's just no way...

05:07.410 --> 05:09.310
That girl is cute.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.210
Your voice is fine.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.380
I get it. You're just
messing with me.

05:15.410 --> 05:17.250
I can do that too.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.290
Hey, I'm writing you a bad song.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.460
That would be funny.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.230
You ready, Austin?
We're live in five,

05:27.260 --> 05:29.490
four, three, two...

05:29.530 --> 05:30.600
One.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.230
Wassup?

05:32.270 --> 05:34.470
I'm Austin moon and
this is my Webcast.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.370
I guess I'm gonna
sing a new song...

05:36.400 --> 05:38.700
- Whoo!
- But, um,

05:38.740 --> 05:42.370
um, first, I thought
I would dance.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.610
Hit it.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.720
What's he doing? Is he stalling?

05:52.750 --> 05:56.450
No. People don't dance
when they stall.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.290
So why isn't he singing my song?

05:59.320 --> 06:01.520
Uh...

06:10.470 --> 06:12.340
Sing the song.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.370
What?

06:15.410 --> 06:17.410
Sing the song. Oh my!

06:18.440 --> 06:20.340
Can't hear you... dancing.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.580
Come on, just sing
the stupid song. No.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.350
Well, if you think
the song's stupid,

06:24.380 --> 06:26.320
I probably shouldn't perform it.

06:26.350 --> 06:28.220
Thanks for watching.
See you next week.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.550
I'm out!

06:30.590 --> 06:32.420
Why didn't you sing my new song?

06:37.530 --> 06:38.660
What?

06:43.270 --> 06:45.600
- What?
- I'm sorry, Ally,

06:45.640 --> 06:47.500
but I didn't like the song.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.250
Dez, did you know about this?

06:56.280 --> 06:58.410
Well, I... I...

07:01.520 --> 07:02.750
Oh!

07:20.630 --> 07:22.730
Austin.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.560
Why didn't you just tell
me you hated the song?

07:25.600 --> 07:27.770
I didn't want to
hurt your feelings.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.700
So it was better to embarrass me

07:29.740 --> 07:31.800
in front of a million
people on the Internet?

07:31.840 --> 07:33.940
You really think a million
people were watching?

07:36.380 --> 07:38.210
Look, it's a good song,

07:38.240 --> 07:40.410
but it's all about how
serious and sensitive I am.

07:40.450 --> 07:43.280
That's not me. That's you.

07:43.320 --> 07:46.490
I'm more chill, "what up?"

07:46.520 --> 07:49.220
I can be chill.

07:51.290 --> 07:54.130
♪ What's up? ♪

07:55.290 --> 07:57.130
Oh yeah, that's chill.

07:58.330 --> 08:00.200
Look, the point is, Ally,

08:00.230 --> 08:02.430
I feel like you
don't even know me.

08:02.470 --> 08:05.300
I like having fun. I
break some rules.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.310
I color outside the lines.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.480
Why do you have a coloring book?

08:10.510 --> 08:13.280
I just told ya... I'm fun.

08:15.150 --> 08:18.520
I'm fun too. I can color
outside the lines.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.390
I can't color outside the lines.

08:22.490 --> 08:26.160
Okay, maybe we don't know
each other that well.

08:26.190 --> 08:28.190
We've only been partners
for a little while.

08:28.230 --> 08:30.360
Hey, what if we hang out more?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.260
I bet if we get to know
each other better,

08:32.299 --> 08:36.100
- it could help our songwriting.
- That's a great idea.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.140
I'll do stuff you like and
you can do stuff I like.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.440
- Cool. What are we gonna do?
- Uh...

08:44.310 --> 08:48.280
The cloud watching club
meets in five minutes.

08:50.350 --> 08:52.420
Oh yay.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.260
<i>Ooh ooh, look,</i>

08:56.290 --> 08:58.390
that cloud looks like
a car with wings.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.430
Ooh.

09:00.460 --> 09:04.300
Oh, and that one's a
pineapple on a canoe.

09:04.330 --> 09:05.470
Ah.

09:08.070 --> 09:12.170
- What do you see, Austin?
- A big, white puffy thing.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.440
Boo.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.310
Come on, you're not even trying.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.040
Okay okay.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.120
I see a snowman
eating marshmallows.

09:23.180 --> 09:25.120
Wrong.

09:25.150 --> 09:27.450
It's a bunny on a bicycle.

09:27.490 --> 09:29.320
How can you not see that?

09:29.360 --> 09:32.190
Can you believe this guy?

09:32.230 --> 09:34.090
- Come on, man. Really?
- He's crazy.

09:36.260 --> 09:38.530
Okay, now I know you better.

09:38.570 --> 09:40.330
You like really lame things.

09:40.370 --> 09:43.070
- Oh.
- Can we go do my stuff now?

09:43.110 --> 09:45.440
If you can think of
something more fun

09:45.470 --> 09:48.210
than cloud watching,
I'm all ears.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.410
I'm taking you to a
horror movie fest.

09:53.450 --> 09:56.250
I was supposed to go
with you to that.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.490
Ugh, I hate horror movies.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.428
- They're so boring.
- More boring

10:00.440 --> 10:02.360
than staring at
clouds all afternoon?

10:02.390 --> 10:04.490
Yeah, that's the boringest
thing I've ever heard.

10:04.530 --> 10:07.260
Hey, check it out... a
bunny on a bicycle.

10:09.130 --> 10:12.170
It's not a bunny on a bicycle!

10:14.200 --> 10:16.340
It's a bunny on a bicycle.

10:16.370 --> 10:18.240
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.550
How did you not
like "swamp bride"?

10:28.590 --> 10:31.420
There was a wedding.
Girls love weddings.

10:31.460 --> 10:34.460
The swamp guy ate
the bridesmaids.

10:35.490 --> 10:37.230
They ran out of appetizers.

10:39.330 --> 10:41.130
Ah.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.170
This stuff is just silly.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.370
I mean chewy eyeballs and
chocolate intestines?

10:46.410 --> 10:47.610
Don't forget red veins.

10:49.340 --> 10:50.510
Oh yeah.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.510
- Hey, Walter.
- Hi, Walter.

10:54.550 --> 10:56.350
Don't "hey, hi, waiter" me.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.180
You littered in my theater.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.420
- We didn't litter.
- Oh yeah?

11:00.450 --> 11:03.190
Look what I found
underneath your seat.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.460
Recognize <i>this?</i>

11:04.490 --> 11:07.290
Uh, yeah, it's popcorn.

11:07.330 --> 11:10.360
Aha! How would you know
that if you didn't litter?

11:10.400 --> 11:14.270
Uh, because we've
seen popcorn before?

11:16.600 --> 11:19.100
I'm watching you.

11:19.140 --> 11:20.510
You too.

11:26.350 --> 11:29.410
Uh, hi, Dez. What are you
supposed to be, an alien zombie?

11:29.450 --> 11:32.480
No, a zombie alien.
I'm a zalien...

11:32.520 --> 11:35.190
A character from my favorite
13 movies of all time.

11:35.220 --> 11:37.220
"Zaliens," "zaliens
2," "zaliens 3,"

11:37.260 --> 11:39.590
"Zaliens 4," "zaliens
5," "zaliens 7..."

11:39.630 --> 11:42.260
- Ah ah ah, you forgot "zaliens 6.
" -..."Zaliens 8"...

11:42.290 --> 11:45.160
Ugh, that movie stinks. I
wish I could forget it.

11:48.170 --> 11:51.270
Hey, guys. I'm ready
for the fight fest.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.370
Whoa.

11:53.410 --> 11:56.410
Oh. Ah. Wah! Yeah.

11:56.440 --> 12:01.250
Nelson, it's a fright
fest, not a fight fest.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.520
Aw, nartz.

12:03.550 --> 12:06.350
I practiced my right
hook all week.

12:06.390 --> 12:08.250
Well, keep practicing.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.320
Guess who's here to
get her zalien on.

12:12.430 --> 12:15.160
Seriously?

12:15.200 --> 12:17.236
We're wearing the same costume,
but you're scared of her?

12:17.260 --> 12:20.430
I'm scared because you guys
have something in common.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.340
Best "zalien" movie ever?

12:25.370 --> 12:28.540
Uh, duh, "zaliens 3: Brain
eaters from beyond."

12:28.570 --> 12:32.110
- Best scene in that movie.
- Uh, duh, when the Zaliens take

12:32.150 --> 12:34.226
the shape of teachers and
eat football team's brains.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.550
Oh, okay okay, no biggie.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.450
So we have a few
things in common.

12:38.490 --> 12:41.350
That doesn't make us friends.
It could just be a coincidence.

12:41.390 --> 12:43.360
Favorite number between
one and a billion.

12:43.390 --> 12:44.520
Two.

12:46.290 --> 12:48.260
Zalien brain suck!

12:50.630 --> 12:53.470
Okay, this is the scariest
thing I've seen all day.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.216
I think it's kinda cool they
have something in common.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.570
I wish we were more like them.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.270
Brain suck!

13:02.310 --> 13:04.410
Don't suck my brain.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.380
Okay, so we don't
like the same stuff,

13:07.410 --> 13:09.220
but at least we're getting
to know each other.

13:09.250 --> 13:12.080
And now it's Ally's turn.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.450
So fasten your seat belt,

13:13.490 --> 13:16.220
because you're about to take
a ride on the fun train.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.530
The mall pond?

13:22.500 --> 13:26.100
I think the fun train let us
off at the wrong station.

13:29.140 --> 13:31.540
Hey, I come here for
creative inspiration.

13:31.570 --> 13:34.110
I sit on this bench,

13:34.140 --> 13:36.280
watch the geese and write
lyrics in my song book.

13:36.310 --> 13:38.180
Have a seat.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.110
I'm not sitting on that bench.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.320
Do you have to hate
everything I like?

13:42.350 --> 13:45.120
No, the bench is covered
with goose poop.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.450
Eww.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.560
Uh, anyway,

13:48.590 --> 13:51.130
I write all my best songs here.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.490
Well, with the help of pickles.

13:53.530 --> 13:55.330
I already know you like pickles.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.230
- Can we go now?
- No no no. No.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.500
That's pickles.

14:02.570 --> 14:05.170
I've been coming here to hang with
him since I was a little girl.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.470
Watching helps me when
I have writer's block.

14:07.510 --> 14:10.380
I get it. It's kinda why
I like horror movies.

14:10.410 --> 14:13.180
There's something about
monsters slurping up brains

14:13.210 --> 14:15.380
that gets me psyched to perform.

14:15.420 --> 14:18.420
- Don't you think he's cute?
- I guess.

14:18.450 --> 14:20.350
Okay, you're cute.

14:22.490 --> 14:26.460
Oh no, they're getting rid
of the pond tomorrow.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.500
They're making this
into a parking lot.

14:28.530 --> 14:31.330
What's gonna happen to pickles?

14:31.370 --> 14:34.570
Maybe he can move into that store
with all the ducks in the window.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.270
That's a chinese restaurant.

14:38.270 --> 14:40.540
Okay, calm down.

14:40.570 --> 14:43.410
We'll call a zoo and...
what are you doing?

14:44.510 --> 14:47.350
Stealing a goose.
I need pickles.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.350
Who else is gonna help
me write your songs?

14:49.380 --> 14:53.220
Ally, are you
breaking the rules?

14:53.250 --> 14:55.120
<i>Awesome!</i>

14:55.150 --> 14:58.160
I never thought I'd see Ally
Dawson dressed as a swamp bride,

14:58.190 --> 15:00.430
stealing a goose and running
from a security guard.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.430
I'm not running from
a security guard.

15:03.460 --> 15:06.300
- Well, you should be.
- Ma <i>freeze!</i>

15:16.360 --> 15:18.370
Ooooow

15:27.680 --> 15:30.680
I'm sorry. My friend
here is really childish.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.550
I promise he won't
do that again.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.718
Why did we come back here?

15:45.730 --> 15:47.700
We had to get away from
that security guard.

15:47.730 --> 15:50.470
You just wanna watch the
end of "zaliens 5."

15:50.500 --> 15:52.700
Then we're killing two
birds with one stone.

15:52.740 --> 15:55.470
Shh.

15:55.510 --> 15:57.710
It's just an expression.
We're not killing any birds.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.740
Shh! No talking
during the movie!

16:00.780 --> 16:02.610
Shh!

16:02.650 --> 16:04.610
Did you just honk at me?

16:04.650 --> 16:08.350
- No, Walter, uh, that was...
- Me!

16:09.390 --> 16:11.550
I honked at you. Honk!

16:11.590 --> 16:13.720
Excuse me?

16:13.760 --> 16:15.620
I'm warning you, kid.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.560
I speak goose and
that kind of language

16:17.590 --> 16:19.530
will not be tolerated
in my theater.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.300
Sorry, Walter. I
meant to say <i>honk.</i>

16:23.330 --> 16:26.430
Apology accepted. I'm
still watching you.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.740
Hey, who littered?

16:28.770 --> 16:31.640
That better be a real eyeball
and not a gummy one.

16:33.710 --> 16:36.440
Shh!

16:36.480 --> 16:39.650
- What's in your dress?
- Pickles the goose.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.480
We need to find him a new home because
they're tearing out the pond.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.550
<i>Shh!</i>

16:44.590 --> 16:46.490
Why won't he quiet down?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.320
I don't know. Maybe he's hungry.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.290
There's popcorn on the floor.
Let him eat that.

16:50.330 --> 16:53.330
Okay. Okay, pickles, come on.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.400
Oh. Oh.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.700
Uh, where did Dez go?

16:59.740 --> 17:01.770
Hey, guys,

17:01.800 --> 17:04.569
did you know there's
free popcorn down here?

17:06.440 --> 17:08.440
I'm sorry. Pardon me.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.710
We've got a little problem.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.450
You've got a little problem.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.380
You're eating popcorn
off the floor.

17:15.420 --> 17:17.720
No, pickles crawled
under the seats.

17:17.750 --> 17:19.589
Oh! We've got to get him back.

17:19.619 --> 17:23.690
<i>Ow! Something just bit me!</i>

17:23.730 --> 17:25.630
- Shh!
- Ow!

17:25.660 --> 17:28.460
It bit me again!

17:28.500 --> 17:30.570
There's a zalien in here!

17:30.600 --> 17:33.340
It's... it's not a zalien.
It's a goose.

17:33.370 --> 17:35.670
A zombie goose!

17:46.480 --> 17:47.780
Pickles! Oh!

17:56.490 --> 17:58.390
- Oh!
- Ow!

17:58.430 --> 18:00.760
Oh! Run for your lives!

18:02.630 --> 18:04.530
Exit in an orderly fashion!

18:04.570 --> 18:07.640
- Everybody panic!
- That's in a disorderly fashion.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.610
That's it, goose.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.310
Nobody wrecks my theater.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.550
This is awesome!

18:20.550 --> 18:21.620
Awesome?

18:21.650 --> 18:23.420
Pickles just caused a
panic in the theater

18:23.450 --> 18:26.420
and is attacking Walter.
How can you be laughing?

18:26.460 --> 18:29.460
Because pickles just caused
a panic in the theater

18:29.490 --> 18:32.630
and is attacking Walter.
It's funny!

18:32.660 --> 18:34.600
You've gotta look at
things my way sometimes

18:34.630 --> 18:36.376
- and stop being so serious.
- Oh, my poor nose.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.600
Ow ow ow!

18:41.410 --> 18:43.640
You're right. This
is kind of funny.

18:46.310 --> 18:49.550
Walter, shh! There's no
screaming in the theater.

18:58.690 --> 19:02.390
- What are you doing?
- Pickles is going to the animal reserve...

19:02.430 --> 19:04.730
- So I'm knitting him some
webbed-footie pajamas.

19:10.530 --> 19:13.470
Yesterday was fun. I'm
glad we got to hang out.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.700
Me too. I feel like we
really know each other now.

19:16.740 --> 19:20.310
So we're different... it
makes us better partners.

19:20.340 --> 19:23.510
Totally. You sure you're gonna
be okay without pickles?

19:23.550 --> 19:25.650
Yeah, I kind of realize

19:25.680 --> 19:28.420
I don't need him to help
me write songs anymore.

19:28.450 --> 19:30.550
I've got a new goose.
His name is Austin.

19:30.590 --> 19:34.620
Cool, you named a goose after me?
Where is he?

19:34.660 --> 19:36.460
It... it's you. You're my goose.

19:36.490 --> 19:38.630
Why, because I pooped
on a bench one time?

19:38.660 --> 19:40.530
I was two years old.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.360
No, it's a metaphor.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.570
I have you, so I don't
need pickles anymore.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.500
Oh, thanks, Ally.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.746
You wanna go work on a new song

19:49.770 --> 19:51.610
- for the Webcast?
- I already wrote one.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.340

much better than the other one.

Guess who got a job
at t-shirt world?

21:18.500 --> 21:20.670
Guess who gets a best
friend discount?

21:23.440 --> 21:26.440
I'm so happy you guys like
hanging out together.

21:26.470 --> 21:29.640
And by happy, I mean
totally weirded out.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.510
Why? We have the same
favorite horror movie,

21:32.550 --> 21:35.520
the same favorite number and the
same favorite pizza topping.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.350
- Pepperoni.
- Mushrooms.

21:38.390 --> 21:40.320
- Mushrooms?
- Pepperoni?

21:40.350 --> 21:42.760
- Ugh!
- I cannot be friends

21:42.790 --> 21:44.660
with someone who lik <i>mushrooms.</i>

21:44.690 --> 21:48.390
Well, I can't be friends with
someone who likes pepperoni.

21:48.430 --> 21:50.430
You guys are gonna
end your friendship

21:50.460 --> 21:52.560
over something as silly
as a pizza topping?

21:52.600 --> 21:54.700
It's not just a pizza topping.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.600
First she likes pepperoni, then she
doesn't want to get it delivered

21:57.640 --> 21:59.540
because she thinks we
don't get out enough.

21:59.570 --> 22:02.440
But sometimes I'm tired and
I just wanna watch tv!

22:03.680 --> 22:05.340
Why are you so tired
all the time?

22:05.380 --> 22:08.380
I'm the one who works at
least two jobs a day!

22:09.710 --> 22:12.480
Well, everything's
back to normal.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.390
Let's see what you've got.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.290
You're gonna be so proud of me.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.690
I colored outside the lines.

22:20.850 --> 22:22.439
What did you color
outside the lines?

22:22.440 --> 22:24.980
Uhh... right there.

22:27.190 --> 22:28.280
No. Stop.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.390
- Who's outside the lines now?
- You broke my crayon!
