15:54.153 --> 15:56.756
and control the Dark One.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.029
And that's your plan?

16:03.062 --> 16:03.996
To try again?

16:04.030 --> 16:06.933
It was.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.701
If I had killed the Dark One
back then

16:08.734 --> 16:10.670
like I was supposed to,

16:10.703 --> 16:11.938
the way you meant it to be‐

16:11.971 --> 16:14.140
Hey, you figured out

16:14.173 --> 16:16.909
that Bathory and the scroll
were the key.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.178
How useful is that?

16:22.081 --> 16:24.784
Before the Oracle
was the Oracle,

16:24.817 --> 16:28.154
she was Bathory.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.257
What about the Dark One?

16:31.290 --> 16:33.059
Who was she?

16:33.092 --> 16:34.627
Olivia?

16:36.162 --> 16:38.731
Yes.

16:38.764 --> 16:45.071
And she was good and pure
and I murdered her.

16:48.207 --> 16:51.177
Well, maybe in her case

16:51.210 --> 16:54.347
death isn't what
you think it is.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.755
It happened after I bit
the Dark One.

17:02.788 --> 17:06.092
Olivia, the woman who's body
was taken over,

17:06.125 --> 17:08.761
part of her is still in there.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.396
And now she's fighting back.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.965
Talk about having someone
on the inside.

17:12.999 --> 17:16.402
The Dark One is gonna be working
on ways to protect herself.

17:16.435 --> 17:20.473
And she knows I'm back and
that we flipped her last bride.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.242
Losing a battle doesn't mean
you lost the war.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.848
Who is this?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.983
The key to getting inside
the White House.

17:46.632 --> 17:47.733
The Vice President?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.368
The White House is one of
the most secure buildings

17:49.402 --> 17:50.369
in the world.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.138
This is the one guy that
can shut it all down

17:52.171 --> 17:53.272
and get us inside.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.273
The gatekeeper.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.908
How'd you pull this off?

17:55.942 --> 17:58.144
You're not the only one
with aces up your sleeve.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.413
Mine just happens to have
four stars on his shoulder.

18:00.446 --> 18:03.249
General Lannister ring a bell?

18:03.282 --> 18:04.784
So what, he's just supposed
to believe us

18:04.817 --> 18:06.452
that the President
is a vampire?

18:06.485 --> 18:07.753
No, he's not gonna believe
anything we say.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.624
That's why we have to turn a
skeptic into a true believer.

18:11.657 --> 18:14.627
You realize this is
full‐on treason, right?

18:14.660 --> 18:17.396
Well, so was the War
of Independence.

18:21.767 --> 18:22.702
I'm sorry about this, sir,

18:22.735 --> 18:24.637
but there's some things
you need to understand.

18:24.670 --> 18:29.742
I can assure you the government
won't negotiate with terrorists.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.744
Yeah, that's what you don't get.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.813
The terrorists are
the government.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.449
You saw who your protection
detail was.

18:36.482 --> 18:40.620
How did you get General
Lannister to betray his country?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.321
You'll face a death sentence
for this.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.889
We're all facing
a death sentence.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.825
That's what we need you
to understand.

18:45.858 --> 18:49.595
You thought you kept the threat
out there, but it's not.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.165
It's here and it's sitting
in the Oval Office.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.435
You think President Archer
is a vampire.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.005
President Archer was murdered
at Fort Collins.

18:59.038 --> 19:00.773
You've been dealing
with an imposter.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.209
Who goes by the name of...

19:03.242 --> 19:04.543
Dracula.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.881
[distant screaming]

19:15.421 --> 19:17.890
[wailing]

19:24.964 --> 19:26.799
How did she get like this?

19:26.832 --> 19:28.267
It's the scroll.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.435
When she used it against
the Dark One

19:29.468 --> 19:32.738
she said it would come
with a cost.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.874
I might be able to help her.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.876
To clear her mind.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.245
Something I learned
in the Dark Realm.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.747
What're you gonna do?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.015
Connect with her.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.417
With her mind?

19:44.450 --> 19:46.552
She lost it.

19:46.585 --> 19:49.388
If I can help her fight
the darkness

19:49.422 --> 19:51.557
I might be able
to pull her back.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.393
What if you end up
just like her?

19:54.427 --> 19:56.729
We can't do this without her,
right?

20:00.766 --> 20:02.835
Our father tried to connect
with us once.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.803
To help us.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.504
And what I felt, the pain
that he shared,

20:05.538 --> 20:09.942
it was almost too much to take.

20:09.975 --> 20:12.878
I've learned how to live
with the pain.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.681
It can make you stronger.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.951
I have to try.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.792
[gasps]

20:35.067 --> 20:36.469
You two.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.904
You're on the most wanted list.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.573
Vampires.

20:40.606 --> 20:41.741
Traitors.

20:41.774 --> 20:42.575
Both.

20:42.608 --> 20:46.378
All due respect, sir,
they're not.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.080
I know it's a lot to digest
but we need your help

20:48.114 --> 20:49.682
if we're gonna bring her down.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.485
Bring her down?

20:52.518 --> 20:54.620
As in kill her?

20:55.387 --> 20:58.657
You want me to help you kill the
President of the United States?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.693
You are all out of your minds.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.661
Why do you think Lannister
helped us grab you?

21:02.695 --> 21:04.764
Because he's a traitor.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.800
Or maybe he's the biggest
patriot we got left.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.769
President Park is still alive.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.637
The two of them spoke.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.639
Now you're going to conjure up
a dead president

21:13.672 --> 21:16.108
to try and convince me?

21:16.142 --> 21:19.111
Eli, if you're listening to me
then the plan worked.

21:19.145 --> 21:22.014
Hard as it may be to believe,
I'm alive.

21:22.047 --> 21:25.618
And all the crazy stuff they're
telling you, it's true.

21:25.651 --> 21:28.821
Archer's gone and you have
to help stop what's coming.

21:28.854 --> 21:29.955
I hope to see you soon,

21:29.989 --> 21:33.626
and we can put this country
right again, together.

21:36.829 --> 21:39.398
I'll tell you what.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.500
Pretty damn convincing.

21:42.802 --> 21:46.105
But if powerful vampires
can change form,

21:46.138 --> 21:47.072
pretend to be somebody else,

21:47.106 --> 21:50.142
couldn't you have just faked
that recording?

21:50.176 --> 21:51.677
Oh, for Christ's sake!
What's it gonna take?

21:51.710 --> 21:54.413
Axel, I got this.

21:57.016 --> 22:03.022
You think I'm a vampire
in human disguise.

22:03.055 --> 22:06.525
Maybe you're right, you know?

22:06.559 --> 22:09.461
In which case I should
just do this.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.162
No!

22:10.196 --> 22:11.397
God, no!

22:11.430 --> 22:13.499
[groaning]

22:14.800 --> 22:16.836
If I'm one of them,
you're gonna turn.

22:16.869 --> 22:17.937
And if you don't

22:17.970 --> 22:19.872
you're gonna have to wake up
and face the truth.

22:19.905 --> 22:24.076
Why don't you sit right here,
and see what happens?

22:32.785 --> 22:35.421
[struggling]

22:35.454 --> 22:37.623
[speaking in ancient language]

22:42.461 --> 22:43.896
Come on, Vanessa.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.401
Mom!

22:52.571 --> 22:54.940
What the hell is happening?

22:54.974 --> 22:58.711
She's trying to get in her head
and cure her.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.980
What? How?

23:05.017 --> 23:06.986
[struggling]

23:07.019 --> 23:12.458
[whispering voices]

23:18.764 --> 23:20.099
The darkness.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.869
Vanessa's taking it from her.

23:26.805 --> 23:29.775
[speaking ancient language]

23:29.808 --> 23:33.979
[screaming]

23:35.147 --> 23:36.548
Mom, no!

23:38.050 --> 23:39.518
You can't do this.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.654
I can't lose you again.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.761
Is she ok?

23:49.995 --> 23:51.730
Is she ok?

23:53.866 --> 23:55.901
Is she ok?

23:58.804 --> 24:00.172
Bathory?

24:04.843 --> 24:06.612
Jack?

24:07.012 --> 24:09.048
I can see you.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.317
I can see.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.918
You're back.

24:13.852 --> 24:14.620
It's ok.

24:14.653 --> 24:15.854
It's ok.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.662
You're ok.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.970
Vanessa saved you.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.040
Thank you.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.180
Thank you.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.683
I've only been there once.

24:44.717 --> 24:48.587
The tunnel runs
from here to here.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.122
Where've you been?

24:50.155 --> 24:52.157
Fixing what was broken.

24:53.959 --> 24:56.562
Some things can't be fixed.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.965
Axel, I'm sorry for all you've
been put through‐

24:59.999 --> 25:00.833
Save it.

25:00.866 --> 25:02.735
Your words are worthless.

25:02.768 --> 25:04.103
You do your job,
you play your part,

25:04.136 --> 25:06.238
I'll be happy to never
see you again.

25:06.905 --> 25:13.145
If she's as strong as you say,
this Dark One,

25:13.178 --> 25:15.881
you really think you can
kill her?

25:24.089 --> 25:26.825
Where are you, my love?

25:30.329 --> 25:31.830
Where?

25:39.104 --> 25:42.307
There you are.

25:52.518 --> 25:53.852
It's me,

25:53.886 --> 25:54.653
No, I'm safe.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.422
I'm safe.

25:56.455 --> 25:57.956
I need you to listen to me.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.525
I need you to clear
the White House

25:59.558 --> 26:02.528
of all remaining secret service
and support staff.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.730
That's right, everyone.

26:04.763 --> 26:07.466
Do not inform Delta Force
of our directive.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.802
Or the Office of the President.

26:09.835 --> 26:10.869
No, listen to me, Jillian.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.538
Listen to me!

26:12.571 --> 26:15.541
This is a matter of
national security.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.378
Contact General Lannister at
the Pentagon for verification.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.413
Trust no one else.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.415
I'm counting on you, Jillian.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.887
I've done everything I can.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.122
They'll stage a mock
disaster drill,

26:30.155 --> 26:33.592
clearing the White House of
anyone who will get in your way.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.893
But the Deltas...

26:34.927 --> 26:36.462
Those vampire guards
and the Dark One

26:36.495 --> 26:37.930
won't take the bait.

26:37.963 --> 26:39.364
They'll stay right where
they are.

26:39.398 --> 26:40.632
She's gotta know
the circle is closing

26:40.666 --> 26:42.434
and we should hit while
we have the chance.

26:42.468 --> 26:43.702
Sounds like we're a go.

26:43.735 --> 26:45.003
Yeah.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.538
When do we strike, boss?

26:46.572 --> 26:49.441
As soon as all those real
people are out of there.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.647
You ready?

26:55.681 --> 26:57.416
You?

26:57.850 --> 26:59.084
Almost.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.194
What's wrong?

27:09.228 --> 27:10.462
Nothing.

27:10.496 --> 27:12.798
Just feeling, you know.

27:12.831 --> 27:18.103
Probably just some uh, nerves
for what lies ahead.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.806
That's not it.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.774
You look burdened.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.110
By something bigger.

27:33.018 --> 27:37.723
See, at first I thought
it might be the Dark One.

27:37.756 --> 27:43.962
Some, like, residual left over
vampire legacy.

27:43.996 --> 27:48.100
These voices,
they were calling me,

27:48.133 --> 27:49.334
and it wasn't the Dark One.

27:49.368 --> 27:56.775
It wasn't her, it... it was like
it was my Sisterhood calling.

27:56.808 --> 28:00.145
You said they were all dead.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.015
Ones that I knew.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.584
Yet that's what I heard.

28:07.819 --> 28:10.289
I'm sorry you lost them.

28:10.322 --> 28:14.693
I know they meant everything
to you.

28:14.726 --> 28:16.895
But that wasn't your fault.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.133
I know, I know, I know.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.734
I just...

28:25.604 --> 28:28.640
I fight for them now,
you know?

28:28.674 --> 28:30.943
Fight for their memory.

28:30.976 --> 28:33.645
And I will honour them.

28:33.679 --> 28:35.180
I will.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.685
Even if it costs me my life.

28:42.688 --> 28:45.090
I won't let that happen.

28:45.123 --> 28:46.959
I swear.

29:03.208 --> 29:04.743
Hey.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.144
Got a sec?

29:06.178 --> 29:07.613
Uh, sure.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.189
I'm sorry I didn't do
this sooner.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.423
Uh... what?

29:18.457 --> 29:22.227
Just with all that's going on
its hard to really find time

29:22.261 --> 29:23.996
to get to know each other.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.731
Yeah, a lot's been going on.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.667
Yeah.

29:28.700 --> 29:34.673
Well, before we step
into the fire,

29:34.706 --> 29:36.208
I just‐ I just wanted you
to know

29:36.241 --> 29:39.177
that I realize it was strange
for you to find out

29:39.211 --> 29:42.714
that I'm your biological
mother.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.616
I've had time to process.

29:44.650 --> 29:45.884
It's fine.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.119
Violet.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.558
You don't have to do that.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.728
You don't have
to harden yourself.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.197
It's ok to feel.

30:01.099 --> 30:03.535
I can't get close to you.

30:03.568 --> 30:07.706
I don't know how this ends.

30:07.739 --> 30:10.742
None of us do.

30:10.776 --> 30:19.251
When I lost Dylan and Scarlett
and the mother I never knew

30:19.284 --> 30:21.787
it almost broke me.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.058
But the truth I've learned

30:26.091 --> 30:28.727
is that the darkness feeds
on despair.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.897
It preys on sadness and grief,

30:31.930 --> 30:34.666
and the more you try to stuff
that down

30:34.700 --> 30:37.402
the stronger it gets.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.204
I'm not like you.

30:43.208 --> 30:47.913
You're more like me
than you realize.

30:47.946 --> 30:51.817
And I wanna know that
you're gonna be ok.

30:51.850 --> 30:56.321
Dylan was your flesh and blood.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.656
We're just DNA.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.691
It doesn't matter to me.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.329
I think about you all the time.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.264
Both of you.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.734
And when I think about something
happening to you

31:08.767 --> 31:13.105
I wanna push it away.

31:13.138 --> 31:18.176
But instead I feel it
in my heart.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.312
You do?

31:20.345 --> 31:21.847
Yeah.

31:23.014 --> 31:25.350
It's what makes us human,
Violet.

31:26.351 --> 31:32.791
And whatever you do,
whatever happens,

31:32.824 --> 31:35.227
don't lose sight of that.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.965
I won't.

31:39.998 --> 31:42.200
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.836
This is soon enough.

31:55.947 --> 31:58.750
I think you should have
the amulet from now on.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.886
You know what?
You keep it.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.921
It's safer with you.

32:02.954 --> 32:06.324
But you'll need it to trap
the Dark One's spirit.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.961
Let's cross that bridge
when we get there, ok?

32:17.035 --> 32:18.336
Everything alright?

32:18.370 --> 32:19.371
Yeah.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.408
For once I think so.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.243
Good.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.045
It's time to go.

32:27.078 --> 32:28.380
I'm gonna get Bathory.

32:28.413 --> 32:30.182
‐Ok.
‐I'll see you.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.331
Do you remember the words?

32:46.364 --> 32:47.866
How to use them?

32:47.899 --> 32:48.967
Oh yes.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.403
It's quite powerful.

32:51.436 --> 32:54.239
But only for the one
who can read them.

32:56.441 --> 33:00.278
Lucky for us Vanessa
made you see again.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.247
Quite lucky.

33:02.280 --> 33:06.184
So she's with you now?

33:06.218 --> 33:07.919
Don't you remember?

33:07.953 --> 33:12.057
She used her powers to make
your mind clear again,

33:12.090 --> 33:15.360
bring you back to what you were.

33:15.393 --> 33:18.463
I don't know if
that's quite possible.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.066
After all this time.

33:21.099 --> 33:29.107
I was the bride of the Dark One,
beholden to her until the end.

33:29.140 --> 33:34.079
I know you're struggling being
human again,

33:34.112 --> 33:37.983
stepping into a fight that cost
you everything.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.486
I need to know you're with us.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.623
I'm the key to all of this,
aren't I?

33:44.656 --> 33:48.026
Using the scroll,
neutralizing the Dark One,

33:48.059 --> 33:51.096
so that you and your kin
can bite her.

33:51.129 --> 33:54.232
And then what?

33:54.266 --> 33:58.470
The darkness spills out of her,
like it did before.

33:58.503 --> 34:02.474
But this time I don't just catch
a piece of it.

34:02.507 --> 34:05.277
I catch all of it.

34:05.310 --> 34:08.380
With this. Remember?

34:12.517 --> 34:14.286
Are you ok?

34:15.120 --> 34:20.225
I now know the whole plan.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.261
Good.

34:24.095 --> 34:26.231
We should get the others.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.467
Jack, there is just one
more thing.

34:31.536 --> 34:36.207
[gasps]

34:50.055 --> 34:51.690
Ready for this?

34:51.723 --> 34:53.224
My whole life.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.260
Alright, rock and roll.

34:56.227 --> 34:57.429
Here's that access tunnel.

34:57.462 --> 35:00.198
It runs from under the treasury
building into the east wing.

35:00.231 --> 35:01.633
And your people have cleared
a path?

35:01.666 --> 35:02.901
I have faith in them.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.104
I'm not the only one who's
been unsettled by the President.

35:06.137 --> 35:08.206
Lucky you didn't try to do
anything about it sooner.

35:08.239 --> 35:10.442
You'd all be dead.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.345
I guess timing's everything.

35:14.079 --> 35:15.313
The clock's ticking.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.549
The less time we give the
Dark One to prepare, the better.

35:17.582 --> 35:18.917
Where's Jack?

35:18.950 --> 35:21.252
Didn't she go get Bathory?

35:37.268 --> 35:39.304
‐Jack!
‐Jack!

35:39.337 --> 35:40.905
Jack!

35:43.208 --> 35:44.943
Slow, slow.

35:48.246 --> 35:49.447
Jack.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.582
It's ok.

35:50.615 --> 35:52.150
[gasps]

35:52.183 --> 35:53.551
It's ok.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.420
What happened?

35:55.453 --> 35:57.255
It was Bathory.

35:57.288 --> 35:58.556
She took the amulet.

35:58.590 --> 35:59.591
See? I knew it.

35:59.624 --> 36:00.458
Where did she go?

36:00.492 --> 36:01.292
She couldn't have left
the building,

36:01.326 --> 36:04.129
our people sealed off
all the exits.

36:06.631 --> 36:09.200
She's not trying to leave.

36:09.234 --> 36:10.035
Check the others.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.703
The Vice President. Go!

36:11.736 --> 36:12.737
This is all my fault.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.539
Come on.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.515
[door opens]

36:24.783 --> 36:26.317
Bathory!

36:27.552 --> 36:28.987
Step away from the ledge!

36:29.020 --> 36:30.989
Stay away from me!

36:31.222 --> 36:32.657
Bathory, no!

36:35.493 --> 36:38.697
[sobbing]

36:41.633 --> 36:43.368
I'm sorry, Jack.

36:43.401 --> 36:44.602
Sorry for what?

36:44.636 --> 36:46.271
Putting a blade in her heart?

36:46.304 --> 36:48.807
That wasn't the way
this was supposed to end.

36:48.840 --> 36:52.277
What have you done
with the amulet?

36:58.383 --> 37:00.518
I said stay away!

37:03.521 --> 37:05.523
I saw it in you, Bathory.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.359
When I connected my mind
to yours.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.761
I saw the confusion.

37:09.794 --> 37:11.830
The fear.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.199
I don't know what
I'm doing up here.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.601
How‐ how I came to have this.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.369
She's still got a hold
of you somehow.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.238
The Dark One.

37:20.271 --> 37:22.674
She wants you to betray us.

37:22.707 --> 37:24.342
I can take the shot.

37:24.375 --> 37:27.045
Maybe she drops the amulet
before she goes over the edge.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.480
You kill her, we can't use
the scroll.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.515
Come on, she was never gonna be
on our side.

37:30.548 --> 37:32.150
The dark just runs too deep.

37:32.183 --> 37:35.687
I am not the evil
you think I am.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.590
I want to be free of the Dark
One just as much as you do.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.692
Then step away from the ledge.

37:40.725 --> 37:43.094
Give us back the amulet.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.372
[winces]

37:57.242 --> 37:58.710
Oh, shit.

38:03.515 --> 38:06.584
[Voice of the Dark One]
Such a tragic flaw in your plan.

38:06.618 --> 38:11.189
Placing faith in one so weak,
so poisoned by ambition.

38:11.222 --> 38:12.724
She nearly stopped you.

38:12.757 --> 38:15.126
She would have given her life
all those years ago.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.162
But instead I took it.

38:17.195 --> 38:20.231
Made her more than she could
have been without me.

38:20.265 --> 38:21.633
I perfected her.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.501
Somebody please let me
put a bullet

38:23.535 --> 38:24.669
between this bitch's eyes.

38:24.702 --> 38:26.704
You know the end is coming.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.873
I sensed it in you
when I bit you.

38:28.907 --> 38:32.443
All I could sense
was your frailty.

38:32.477 --> 38:36.548
Your shallow and pointless
legacy.

38:36.581 --> 38:41.619
Every Van Helsing I have ever
met I have bested.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.588
Really?

38:43.621 --> 38:46.424
Then how did I escape
the Dark Realm, huh?

38:46.457 --> 38:51.162
How did I get out of that
little mind trap you left me in?

38:51.196 --> 38:56.201
How did I get close enough
to draw your blood?

38:57.569 --> 38:59.404
You think you can distract
me long enough

38:59.437 --> 39:03.308
to retrieve your little prize?

39:03.341 --> 39:07.478
You are close,
that much is true.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.949
But only because
I'm not quite myself.

39:10.982 --> 39:14.752
A situation that's easy enough
to remedy.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.788
‐No!
‐No!

39:46.484 --> 39:48.219
Bathory.

39:48.853 --> 39:49.687
What have I done?

39:49.721 --> 39:50.989
We can still defeat her.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.624
Together.

39:52.657 --> 39:58.529
No... no.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.266
I cannot.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.735
She will never let me go.

40:03.768 --> 40:05.770
Please, no, Bathory‐

40:05.803 --> 40:08.339
You cannot control me!

40:08.373 --> 40:09.807
You can do this!

40:09.841 --> 40:13.011
Not now.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.879
Not ever.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.517
No!

40:33.798 --> 40:34.499
[thud]

40:34.532 --> 40:40.939
[screaming and crying]
No! No!

40:54.752 --> 40:58.389
You have reached the end
of your time,

40:58.423 --> 41:03.194
my broken beloved.

41:03.227 --> 41:09.968
And I have just begun
the height of mine.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.183
Come to me.

41:31.456 --> 41:33.925
Come to me.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.303
Come to me.

41:46.971 --> 41:49.107
Come to me.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.143
Come to me.

41:52.176 --> 41:54.412
[laughs maniacally]

41:54.445 --> 41:57.181
Come to me!

41:58.249 --> 42:00.651
Come to me!

42:09.761 --> 42:14.999
[rumbling]

42:16.968 --> 42:24.942
[electrical crackling]

42:31.315 --> 42:34.318
Does somebody wanna tell me
what the is going on?

42:34.352 --> 42:38.423
The part of her that was in the
amulet just found its way home.

42:38.456 --> 42:40.324
She's back to her full strength.

42:40.358 --> 42:42.226
What the hell are
we gonna do now?
