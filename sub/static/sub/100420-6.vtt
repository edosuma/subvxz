WEBVTT

00:09.134 --> 00:13.013
...and they even let the birthday boy
pilot the airplane!

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
There were no survivors.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.518
In other news, the newly formed
Hollywoo "Guild of Assistants"

00:18.601 --> 00:20.895
is meeting with industry
power brokers today

00:20.979 --> 00:23.815
to negotiate terms
for a standard agreement.

00:23.898 --> 00:27.277
I'm optimistic about the coming talks
and confident we can avoid a strike.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.987
Our demands are reasonable,

00:29.070 --> 00:31.531
and our services
are crucial to this industry.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.116
All right, you little pishers,

00:33.199 --> 00:37.245
let's wrap this up quick so you can all
go back to getting me wrong coffees.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.039
-What do you want?
-We have one request.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.623
To not be treated like garbage.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.543
It appears we are at an impasse.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.297
[people clamoring]

00:47.839 --> 00:50.383
-Where's my dry cleaning?
-Where's my car?

00:50.633 --> 00:54.929
I don't know any of my passwords!
What's my mother's maiden name?

00:55.263 --> 00:58.349
I'm going into labor!
You need to call my doula!

00:58.433 --> 01:04.022
Will somebody please make me
a reservation at Little Dom's?

01:04.105 --> 01:05.065
[car alarm blaring]

01:05.148 --> 01:06.816
[theme song playing]

01:59.410 --> 02:01.121
[birds chirping]

02:02.747 --> 02:03.832
[groans]

02:03.915 --> 02:06.084
Oh, no. Did I really drink last night?

02:06.167 --> 02:08.128
Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.
I-- [stutters]

02:08.211 --> 02:10.547
-Did anyone see me?
-You were in here all night.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.215
Nobody can know about this.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.510
There are 20 struggling addicts
in this building who are counting on me.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.761
[stammers] Of course.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.221
I'm gonna go home, take a shower.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.014
-This never happened.
-Agreed.

02:20.098 --> 02:23.393
But how do I get out of here
without anyone seeing me?

02:23.935 --> 02:24.936
[sighs]

02:25.895 --> 02:27.897
-Whoa!
-Okay, okay, easy.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.441
This requires a surprising amount
of upper-body strength.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.652
Stop swinging. Just slide down.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.404
Am I being inconspicuous?

02:34.487 --> 02:36.197
Yes. Plus or minus the yelling.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.657
-I'm just gonna let go.
-Don't--

02:37.740 --> 02:40.076
-[both scream]
-[BoJack groans]

02:40.160 --> 02:42.787
Thank you, BoJack,
for being there to catch me.

02:42.871 --> 02:43.746
Up!

02:45.039 --> 02:46.040
[engine starts]

02:48.293 --> 02:49.252
Ew.

02:49.794 --> 02:54.549
"I looked in that case first chance I got
and there was that note still tied there.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.926
That line hadn't touched water
in its life."

02:57.135 --> 02:59.220
"Doesn't mean nothin', Alma."

02:59.304 --> 03:02.974
"Don't try and fool me no more, Ennis.
I know what it means.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.768
Jack Twist, Jack nasty!"

03:05.977 --> 03:07.103
[knocking on door]

03:07.187 --> 03:10.481
The sock puppet players tribute
to Ang Lee will continue after this.

03:11.774 --> 03:16.446
-Oh. Hello, Jorge.
-I have some news. It's about your mother.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.532
Oh, is the news that you're marrying her,

03:19.616 --> 03:22.368
inserting yourself into our family
and ruining my life?

03:22.577 --> 03:26.206
Because I already heard that news
like 25 years ago, Jorge.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.875
-I didn't come to your home to fight.
-Then joke's on you

03:28.958 --> 03:31.419
because you didn't come to my home at all.

03:31.502 --> 03:34.005
-I just sleep on the couch...
-[Jorge sighs]

03:34.088 --> 03:37.383
-...since you and Mom gave me the boot.
-That was ten years ago.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.803
Which, by the way,
is the only thing you ever gave me.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.473
I gave you my name,
and you have clearly wasted it.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.558
Do you know what the Chavez name
stands for?

03:45.642 --> 03:46.976
Yes, Jorge.

03:47.060 --> 03:52.440
Chavez! C for cerebral!
H for high-minded! A for analytical!

03:53.233 --> 03:55.985
V for veracious! E for efficacious!

03:56.069 --> 03:59.030
And Z for zealously practical.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.698
Feels like a cheat on the Z.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.367
Todd, your mother needs your help.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.285
Well, then instead of sending her husband,

04:04.369 --> 04:06.913
she should have asked me herself,
if it's so important to her.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.707
-She's in a coma.
-A rudeness coma?

04:09.791 --> 04:11.459
No, a regular coma.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.587
Oh, my God! Why didn't you open with that?

04:14.837 --> 04:16.756
Please. Your mother needs a kidney.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.635
I put her on the donor waiting list,
but if you're a match...

04:20.718 --> 04:23.763
Oh. I'm sorry.
Of course I would give Mom my kidney.

04:23.846 --> 04:27.058
-Then there's no time to waste--
-"Would" give her my kidney.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.936
"Would." You need to work
on your listening skills.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.105
I sold my extra kidney just last week.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.942
-Why?
-I wanted to buy these sock puppets.

04:36.025 --> 04:40.363
You sold your kidney for... [groans]
I'm sorry I came.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.990
If you'd like to visit your mother--

04:42.073 --> 04:45.034
Wait. What if instead
of visiting my mother,

04:45.118 --> 04:46.661
we got my kidney back?

04:46.911 --> 04:50.540
Come on, Ruthie!
Field trip to the organ market!

04:50.623 --> 04:52.417
-[Ruthie coos]
-[groans]

04:52.500 --> 04:54.252
[wind howling]

04:54.335 --> 04:56.379
[dial tone blaring]

04:59.716 --> 05:00.717
[thunder rumbles]

05:01.092 --> 05:02.885
Princess Carolyn, this is a catastrophe.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.847
-You know it.
-This strike has shut down the whole city!

05:05.930 --> 05:07.432
Assistants want respect?

05:07.515 --> 05:10.685
If we respect them, how are we supposed
to work through our rage issues?

05:10.768 --> 05:13.646
On our spouses and children?
That doesn't seem fair.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.565
There's gotta be a better way!

05:15.648 --> 05:19.027
Uh, maybe we could circumvent
giving the assistants what they want

05:19.110 --> 05:21.154
by giving them what they think they want.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.489
You know, like how we satiate TV creators

05:23.573 --> 05:26.117
by giving them little vanity cards
at the end of episodes,

05:26.200 --> 05:29.245
then sell the shows to streaming networks
that auto-skip the end credits

05:29.329 --> 05:31.456
so no one even sees the vanity cards!

05:31.539 --> 05:33.833
Yeah, yeah, that's good.
But what do assistants want?

05:33.916 --> 05:36.044
iTunes gift cards? Amazon gift cards?

05:36.127 --> 05:38.671
I honestly can't think of another thing
an assistant would want.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.797
When I was an assistant,

05:39.881 --> 05:42.633
the only thing I wanted
was not to be an assistant anymore.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.385
[gasps] Princess Carolyn, I'll say to you

05:44.469 --> 05:46.346
what I said to David Levy
when we were developing

05:46.429 --> 05:48.806
The Addams Family
and brainstorming ancillary characters,

05:48.890 --> 05:51.768
like cousins and whatnot: That's Itt!

05:56.105 --> 05:59.317
-[man] Hey! Sad dog!
-Ha-ha! You know it!

05:59.400 --> 06:03.446
Wow. Mr. Peanutbutter
and Joey Pogo in the same room?

06:03.529 --> 06:07.367
What is this? Two days ago
when I almost hit you with my car?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.619
[chuckles] No! That was outside!

06:09.702 --> 06:11.954
Listen, I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.499
I got a call from this mental health
advocacy group.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.585
Those guys are jizzin' their pants
over your heroic admission

06:17.668 --> 06:18.878
of your struggle with depression,

06:19.045 --> 06:21.464
and they wanna help you
share your story with the world.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.799
The world, huh?

06:22.882 --> 06:26.219
I wanted to set up a meeting,
but my assistant went on strike,

06:26.302 --> 06:29.430
and phones, for me, are, like, what?

06:29.514 --> 06:31.641
Even if you had your assistant,
it wouldn't do any good.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.726
My reps' assistants
are all on strike, too.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.813
Oh, bummer. Guess there's no way
to get in touch then.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.607
Too bad. I'd love to get together.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.861
Goodbye, fancy room.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.531
Goodbye, chair. Goodbye, Stinky Susan.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.657
Huh? [sniffs]

06:49.575 --> 06:51.452
-Where to?
-Um...

06:51.619 --> 06:53.746
Home, I-- I guess.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.046
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey! Stop the car. Let me out here.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.173
Wow, already stopping for a drink?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.217
Thank you,
your commentary is very helpful.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.344
-Five stars, though, right?
-[groans]

07:11.264 --> 07:12.515
[slurps]

07:12.598 --> 07:13.641
[inhales, exhales]

07:13.933 --> 07:15.017
[sighs]

07:15.393 --> 07:17.270
-Doctor Champ, what are you doing?
-Okay.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.982
This mood about "never have another drop
of alcohol again?"

07:21.065 --> 07:23.401
-Are we sure about this?
-Okay, Doctor Champ, clearly, you--

07:23.484 --> 07:26.070
I'm sitting here, like,
whatever happened to moderation, buddy?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.905
So, you're telling me
the guiding philosophy

07:27.989 --> 07:32.201
of the six months of rehab
I just paid for is complete bullshit?

07:32.410 --> 07:34.537
Hey, man, it works for you,
it works for you.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.915
As for me? Uh, check, please!

07:38.082 --> 07:40.293
No, that's a figure of speech.
I don't want the check.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.962
Please replenish me with another mar-gar.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.175
["Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" plays]

07:49.635 --> 07:51.679
-[bell ringing]
-Howdy, howdy!

07:51.762 --> 07:54.390
Welcome to Mike and Morgan's
House of Organs!

07:54.474 --> 07:57.393
We handle all your matters,
from keyboards to bladders.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.895
Mike, give it a rest.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.940
-What's with all the boxes?
-We're going out of business.

08:03.024 --> 08:03.941
Oh, no!

08:04.025 --> 08:06.569
I told you
we should just stick to the pianos.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.197
You wanted to expand into body parts.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.990
You printed the sign that said,

08:11.073 --> 08:14.452
"For all your organ needs."
I was just trying to keep us honest.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.746
Judging from the foolishness
of your business plan,

08:16.829 --> 08:18.247
I assume you don't keep records,

08:18.331 --> 08:20.041
but we're trying to track down
my son's kidney.

08:20.124 --> 08:20.958
Oh...

08:21.042 --> 08:25.546
Sorry, all our kidneys went to Chicago.
Jeremiah Whitewhale bought us out.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.506
-[gasps]
-[organ plays]

08:26.589 --> 08:29.926
-Of Whitewhale Industries? Why?
-He's stockpiling organs

08:30.009 --> 08:32.970
because he's a rich old guy
who wants to live forever.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.222
[organ plays]

08:34.889 --> 08:35.973
Oh, no!

08:36.057 --> 08:39.185
Well, this was a pointless excursion.
I'm heading back to the hospital.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.062
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

08:41.145 --> 08:44.899
No. It's my fault
for expecting anything different.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.817
-[door opens, closes]
-[groans]

08:47.109 --> 08:48.736
Can we offer you anything on your way out?

08:48.819 --> 08:50.530
You want a Wurlitzer or a spleen

08:50.613 --> 08:53.699
or an industrial-sized tub
of general anesthesia?

08:54.033 --> 08:57.119
Yeah, give me the anesthesia.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.372
[Diane] You could sneak in
during the party

08:59.455 --> 09:02.333
as long as nobody's estranged husband
who's a cop is visiting.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.876
Holiday party, huh?

09:03.960 --> 09:06.629
-What? Where am I?
-You're in Chicago!

09:06.712 --> 09:09.298
-Hi, I'm Diane. This is Guy.
-How you doin'?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.509
Oh! Are you ready for introductions
or are you still processing

09:11.592 --> 09:13.970
the whole being kidnapped
across state lines?

09:14.053 --> 09:15.221
I'm sorry, what?

09:15.304 --> 09:17.348
We're breaking
into the Whitewhale building.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.892
-Why?
-To get back my kidney and save Mom

09:19.976 --> 09:22.770
and prove to you
that I'm not just a wacky screw-up

09:22.853 --> 09:26.065
who engages primarily
in goofy whimsical mess-arounds.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.901
-How did you get me on the plane?
-We did a Weekend at Bernie's.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.239
-[groans]
-As I was saying,

09:33.322 --> 09:35.408
tonight's the Whitewhale
employee holiday party.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.119
Security will be tight, but you can use
my employee ID to get in,

09:38.202 --> 09:39.912
because I'm technically
still on the payroll.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.290
Wait, you didn't quit?
We haven't worked there in months.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.584
Nobody's noticed!
They keep sending me checks.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.170
Cashing them is my way of very gradually
taking down the man from the inside.

09:48.254 --> 09:52.300
Hey. C-- can we sidebar for a minute?
Is this really the best use of your time?

09:52.383 --> 09:55.177
You've been beating yourself up
about how slowly the book's going. So...

09:55.261 --> 09:58.431
But the book is about me
and my life, so by living my life,

09:58.514 --> 10:00.308
I am in fact working on the book.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.351
You don't have to write this book
if you don't want to.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.436
Of course I want to.

10:03.519 --> 10:06.564
Okay. I'm just saying, since you started,
you've been pretty down.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.567
-Not yourself. Diane--
-Actually, pretty down is myself.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.569
Can we talk about this later?
We're being rude.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.738
Why don't you offer them
one of your fancy beers?

10:14.655 --> 10:17.658
So, all we need to do
is get into the party,

10:17.742 --> 10:21.954
figure out where the kidneys are,
find my kidney, and sneak out,

10:22.038 --> 10:24.165
all without drawing attention
to ourselves.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.876
And be careful, because
if Jeremiah Whitewhale catches you,

10:26.959 --> 10:28.461
he can legally murder you.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.630
Now, can I get anyone an imperial stout?

10:30.713 --> 10:33.758
The barley was from Portland, Maine,
but the brewery is in Portland, Oregon!

10:33.841 --> 10:35.134
This plan is ludicrous.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.470
Hey, maybe instead
of criticizing everything

10:37.553 --> 10:40.306
like you've done my entire life,
you can get on board?

10:40.389 --> 10:41.432
It's gonna work out.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.643
Things don't just work out, Todd!

10:43.726 --> 10:46.604
Of course they do!
I don't know why you're so negative!

10:46.687 --> 10:47.897
Do you want to help Mom,

10:47.980 --> 10:50.858
or do you wanna just go back
to the hospital and wait?

10:50.941 --> 10:54.153
[sighs] Okay. I'm in.

10:55.529 --> 10:56.489
[thunder rumbling]

10:57.406 --> 11:00.451
I don't feel comfortable negotiating
without my fellow assistants present.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.827
Yeah. This is not about that.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.871
Good, because our demands haven't changed.

11:03.954 --> 11:08.209
Casey, it's been so thrilling to see you
grow into your role as strike captain.

11:08.709 --> 11:12.880
[gasps] You know, there's an opening
at my company for a development exec.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.548
I don't suppose you'd be interested?

11:14.632 --> 11:16.175
Oh! Uh...

11:16.592 --> 11:18.552
I'd have to think about it.
I've never rea--

11:18.636 --> 11:20.221
You'd get overpaid to read scripts,

11:20.304 --> 11:23.057
company credit card,
and a parking spot in the good garage.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.685
-Um...
-Plus, your own assistant.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.188
-An... assistant?
-[thunder rumbling]

11:29.855 --> 11:32.441
-That is, of course, if the strike ends.
-[giggles]

11:32.942 --> 11:35.861
Well, that's a very generous offer,

11:35.945 --> 11:38.030
but I'd have to talk it over
with my colleagues.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.116
Why? Those are assistants.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.494
You're not one of them anymore.
You're one of us.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.830
It's a two-year contract.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.207
Sign right there
and your troubles are over.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.585
[breathes heavily, exhales]

11:51.669 --> 11:52.503
[thunder strikes]

11:52.586 --> 11:54.797
[groans, shrieks]

11:58.050 --> 12:00.261
[both cackling]

12:00.678 --> 12:02.638
-[Ruthie giggles]
-What's so funny?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.349
I was just remembering a funny joke,
unrelated to this.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.809
Can you tell me what it is?

12:06.892 --> 12:08.811
You wouldn't get it.
It's about Zsa Zsa Gabor,

12:08.894 --> 12:11.021
and it's no longer appropriate
in today's climate.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.232
You've made the right decision.
You're gonna love the new job.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.776
-Welcome to the team, Stacey.
-It's Case--

12:18.487 --> 12:20.030
[both] Hmm...

12:22.825 --> 12:24.410
Hey! [grunts]

12:25.202 --> 12:26.579
Sign here to run development

12:26.662 --> 12:30.499
for Saoirse Ronan's production company,
Saoirse and Rescue.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.419
[Turteltaub] Mm-hmm.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.381
I can't be an assistant anymore!

12:37.465 --> 12:39.675
Shirley MacLaine threw a cactus at my head

12:39.759 --> 12:42.762
because I set a meeting
with the wrong Steve McQueen!

12:42.845 --> 12:46.265
How was I supposed to know
she meant the dead one? [cries]

12:46.348 --> 12:50.644
Shh. It's okay. Just sign here
and orchestrate your own great escape.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.939
[Princess Carolyn chuckles]

12:54.857 --> 12:55.858
[Turteltaub] Ooh.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.905
[car horns honking]

13:01.197 --> 13:02.573
Okay, I'm going in.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.493
Todd, promise me
you'll be perspicacious in there.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.911
Perspicacious?

13:06.994 --> 13:09.205
-I don't know the meaning of the word.
-[sighs]

13:12.041 --> 13:14.001
-You're Diane?
-Yes!

13:14.084 --> 13:15.961
-Nguyen?
-That is correct!

13:16.045 --> 13:17.546
I find that hard to believe.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.298
Wow, that's racist.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.967
People don't always
look like their last names.

13:22.051 --> 13:26.305
For example, I'm white,
and my last name is Chavez.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.265
I thought your last name was Nguyen.

13:28.349 --> 13:32.937
-Oh! Uh, yeah, it is! Todd Nguyen.
-Not Diane Nguyen?

13:33.020 --> 13:34.897
Oh, yeah! Diane Nguyen.

13:34.980 --> 13:39.443
That's me, all right,
or my name isn't Todd Chavez.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.570
Well, that was a bust.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.574
Okay, this time,
you're Diane and I'll be Jorge.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.742
Todd, get in the trash can.

13:46.826 --> 13:51.789
I know I'm a disappointment to you,
but I do not live in a trash can, Jorge,

13:51.872 --> 13:54.416
and I haven't for several years now! Hey!

13:54.500 --> 13:55.501
[both grunting]

13:57.378 --> 13:59.129
[speaking in Spanish]

13:59.213 --> 14:01.131
Uh... What? Sorry, I...

14:01.215 --> 14:04.635
Oh. No Español? [speaking in Spanish]

14:06.595 --> 14:08.514
Uh... go ahead.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.558
[indistinct chatter]

14:13.435 --> 14:17.731
-Wow, that was amazing!
-No. That was logical and straightforward.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.905
-Another club soda, please.
-[Doctor Champ] Nerd!

14:24.989 --> 14:26.615
Doctor Champ, what is your plan?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.576
Just gotta drink enough to be steady.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.328
Then, you take me back to Pastiches
and keep me out of trouble.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.999
That way, you don't have to go home
and I can be a good therapy horse.

14:35.082 --> 14:39.086
All my clients get sober, I am a winner,
put my picture on a magazine. [slurps]

14:39.169 --> 14:41.547
Look, I can't let you go back there drunk.

14:41.630 --> 14:46.051
You don't care about me!
You're scared of this guy.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.389
You can't help anybody else
unless you're honest with yourself.

14:50.472 --> 14:53.017
-Know what I mean?
-No. I never know what you mean.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.935
In fact, maybe I wouldn't be so scared

14:55.019 --> 14:57.146
if you'd given me real therapy
over the last six months

14:57.229 --> 14:59.523
instead of just plying me
with folksy aphorisms.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.776
I'm not a therapist! I'm a therapy horse,

15:02.860 --> 15:04.570
a subtle but legally
important distinction.

15:04.820 --> 15:07.323
Besides, you wouldn't accept
real therapy from me.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.365
Oh, and why's that?

15:08.449 --> 15:11.076
Gee, I don't know,
maybe because I'm a horse,

15:11.160 --> 15:12.369
so I remind you of your father,

15:12.453 --> 15:15.789
so you simultaneously resent me
and crave my approval,

15:15.873 --> 15:17.625
an approval which,
ironically, if granted--

15:17.708 --> 15:19.168
Yeah, I would dismiss immediately

15:19.251 --> 15:21.837
and then use as an excuse to resent you
even more, what's your point?

15:21.921 --> 15:26.050
My point is, you're stunted from having
healthy relationships with horses, idiot!

15:26.133 --> 15:27.718
Oh, really? Well, if that were true,

15:27.801 --> 15:29.970
I would have almost
no other horses in my life.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.222
Right, it's almost as if all your friends

15:32.306 --> 15:35.142
and loved ones
are humans or dogs or cats--

15:35.225 --> 15:37.561
But then how do you explain
the one horse I do care about,

15:37.645 --> 15:40.230
my half-sister Hollyhock,
who is also a reminder of my father?

15:40.314 --> 15:43.275
If your theory were true,
wouldn't I keep her at arms' length,

15:43.359 --> 15:45.861
desperate for her to love me
but unwilling to be vulnerable enough

15:45.945 --> 15:46.862
to allow her to hurt me?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.073
You blockhead, she's not your father!

15:49.156 --> 15:53.160
Hollyhock reminds you
of the horse you hate the most. Yourself!

15:53.243 --> 15:54.453
Okay, you got me!

15:54.536 --> 15:57.331
My parents gave me an internalized
self-hatred of horses.

15:57.414 --> 16:00.125
So, my horse body is a prison
that I can never escape.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.752
This manifests in rotten behavior

16:01.835 --> 16:04.254
because I subconsciously believe
I deserve to be punished,

16:04.463 --> 16:07.383
but being famous, I'm never punished,
so I act out even more.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.094
And since this pattern
is so woven into my identity,

16:10.177 --> 16:14.181
it is unfathomable to me that it can
ever be curbed, so instead, I drink!

16:14.390 --> 16:16.183
Uh... Check, please!

16:16.266 --> 16:18.936
So, the only way I can progress
is to return to my life as a sober man

16:19.019 --> 16:22.064
and finally hold myself accountable
for my actions, past and future.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.483
Oh, my God, is this what therapy is?

16:24.566 --> 16:26.318
Why do you keep bringing me checks?

16:26.402 --> 16:27.361
[glasses clanking]

16:27.444 --> 16:30.030
Uh... Doctor Champ?

16:31.281 --> 16:32.324
[elevator dings]

16:33.367 --> 16:34.284
Wow.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.661
-Sorry, folks!
-[both gasp]

16:35.744 --> 16:37.079
This floor's off-limits.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.831
-Oh, but...
-Oh, thank God you're here!

16:38.914 --> 16:41.583
I saw someone at the buffet
putting ketchup on a hot dog.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.461
-What? Not in my town!
-[keys jangling]

16:44.545 --> 16:45.754
[elevator dings]

16:45.838 --> 16:48.465
-Wow, you are really good at this.
-Let's go.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.927
[gasps] Ooh, wow. Hmm.

16:52.469 --> 16:57.766
Oh, look. People who selected kidneys
might also enjoy small intestines.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.686
Just the kidney. We don't need
to be up-sold on other innards.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.021
Yes, sir.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.272
[beeps]

17:04.440 --> 17:07.067
Thank you for... [clears throat] this.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.487
Uh. Once your mother is okay,
we will never bother you again.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.157
-I know that's what you want.
-Why would I want that?

17:15.492 --> 17:18.704
-You never understood me.
-I raised you as my own flesh.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.498
I was tough on you
because I expected big things from you.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.083
You weren't tough. You were mean.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.169
-Because the world is mean!
-Not my world!

17:25.252 --> 17:27.129
I wanted so much for you, Todd.

17:27.212 --> 17:31.425
I wanted to push you to be your best self.
I see now that I failed you.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.303
But you didn't fail me
because I am not a failure.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.180
Look... [sighs] Okay, Todd.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.476
Why do you need to be proud of me
on your terms?

17:40.559 --> 17:44.229
Why can't you see I'm living a good life?
I have friends. I have a job--

17:44.313 --> 17:47.066
You sleep on the couch
and you play with puppets all day.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.027
I'm happy, Jorge.
What more do you want from me?

17:50.110 --> 17:51.612
I want to know that you're okay!

17:51.695 --> 17:54.031
Then why haven't you called in ten years?

17:54.114 --> 17:57.117
You don't think I wanted to?
I'm not the one who...

17:57.618 --> 17:58.869
-What?
-[Jorge exhales]

17:59.578 --> 18:01.663
She loves you, your mother.

18:01.955 --> 18:05.125
But she's very proud.
If you called her, she would talk to you.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.046
Well, she can't talk now
because she's in a coma, right?

18:09.129 --> 18:10.464
[sighs] Yeah.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.385
What are they talking about?

18:17.554 --> 18:19.389
-Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
-[keys beeping]

18:19.473 --> 18:21.809
[groans] Chavezes! You got company!

18:21.892 --> 18:23.477
Get out of there now! Do you read me?

18:23.560 --> 18:25.479
[Diane on radio] Hello? Hello?

18:25.979 --> 18:28.482
Diane? Why is there a walkie-talkie
in our kitchen?

18:28.982 --> 18:30.067
-God damn it!
-[man] Uh...

18:30.150 --> 18:34.196
Excuse me? This garage
is for shopping center customers only.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.406
[groans] Okay, fine, I'll buy a pretzel.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.576
-Or you could just leave.
-No, now I want the pretzel.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.163
[Guy] Hey, Diane, get me a pretzel,
too, please. Love you, okay?

18:43.997 --> 18:45.874
[Jorge gasps] Someone's coming.
We have to go.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.751
I'm not going until I get my kidney.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.254
-Todd, this is serious.
-Yes, I understand.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.588
You are very serious.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.675
You read serious books
and listen to Sirius XM.

18:54.758 --> 18:55.884
We have to go right now.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.929
-Hey!
-Why do you always fight me?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.849
Why do you always try
to make me leave places?

19:01.932 --> 19:02.850
-[man] Hey!
-[both gasp]

19:02.933 --> 19:04.434
Stay right where you are!

19:05.769 --> 19:08.230
-Whoa! [exhales]
-[grumbles]

19:08.689 --> 19:10.566
Um...

19:11.358 --> 19:12.442
[sighs]

19:13.235 --> 19:15.070
[groans]

19:17.406 --> 19:21.285
Uh, I'm sure the other assistants
will be here any minute.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.370
Traffic's real bad because of the rain.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.247
No one else is coming, Stuart.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.375
-Uh... because of the rain?
-They got promoted.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.501
Your ranks are divided.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.296
Your leadership has abandoned you.
Face it, the strike is over.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.965
Whoa. Okay.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.758
We've drawn up a new collective agreement.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.511
You get none of the things you asked for
and you start work again Monday.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.804
Sounds fair.

19:41.096 --> 19:44.308
If I sign this, does that mean
I get a promotion, too?

19:44.391 --> 19:47.644
-Sure, Stuart. Someday.
-[gasps]

19:48.270 --> 19:51.231
[Marv] Princess Carolyn,
I'd love to give you a raise,

19:51.315 --> 19:52.941
but you're thinking like an assistant.

19:53.025 --> 19:58.238
Any day now, you're gonna get promoted
to agent and sign a brand-new contract,

19:58.322 --> 20:02.451
so why are you concerning yourself
with these assistantly trifles?

20:02.534 --> 20:04.912
You really think I have
what it takes to be an agent?

20:04.995 --> 20:08.749
Someday, sure!
But for now, you're my assistant,

20:08.832 --> 20:10.626
and since you've got a similar build

20:10.709 --> 20:13.212
to the angry lady
I fell on at the post office,

20:13.295 --> 20:19.009
I need you to try on these apology bikinis
and report back where they pinch.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.053
-[groans]
-You got it, boss.

20:21.678 --> 20:22.512
[gasps] Oh.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.891
-[Stuart] Um...
-Stuart, don't sign that!

20:25.974 --> 20:28.560
I just remembered
there's a typo on page 12!

20:28.644 --> 20:31.688
Instead of "billable hours,"
I wrote, "Billy Bob showers!"

20:31.772 --> 20:33.357
Ooh, that's not gonna fly, P.C.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.859
That guy hasn't showered since Bad Santa.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.779
Man Who Wasn't There?
More like "Man Who Doesn't Wash There."

20:38.862 --> 20:40.822
Sling Blade? More like "Please Bathe!"

20:40.906 --> 20:45.118
Monster's Ball? More like "Monster Balls."
Great actor, though.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.620
Let me fix up a new version

20:46.703 --> 20:48.413
and you can come back
and sign it tomorrow.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.957
I'll walk you to your car.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.380
Well, this is my car.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.632
-Really?
-No. I don't own a car.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.926
[scoffs] So why did we walk
three blocks in the rain?

21:01.009 --> 21:04.429
I panicked! I've never been in charge
of where to go before!

21:04.513 --> 21:07.099
You're clearly out of your depth
in these negotiations.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.308
Take this number.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.728
Wow. This a lot of money,
Princess Carolyn.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.523
That's not an offer, it's a phone number!

21:15.023 --> 21:16.441
Oh...

21:17.651 --> 21:20.279
-Can you drive me home?
-[sighs]

21:21.947 --> 21:24.574
-Officer, I...
-Sir, did this man attack you?

21:24.658 --> 21:26.994
-What? No.
-You can tell me if he attacked you.

21:27.077 --> 21:31.498
-Hey! Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
-Look, this is all a misunderstanding.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.084
I'm just trying to take
this kidney back to my mom.

21:34.167 --> 21:37.879
Whitewhale's got like a hundred of these.
He won't even miss this one.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.757
Well, aren't you a little scamp.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.467
-[both laugh]
-Oh, stop!

21:42.551 --> 21:43.719
What?

21:46.763 --> 21:51.476
Armageddon? More like "Arma-gettin'
Away From This Stinky Guy!"

21:51.560 --> 21:53.770
What the...? Hey, who's in my chair?

21:54.479 --> 21:56.732
Mr. Turteltaub,
I thought our meeting was at 9 a.m.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.775
-It appears to be 9:03.
-[sighs] Hello.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.069
If you're serious about negotiating,

22:01.153 --> 22:03.655
it's imprudent to send the message
you don't respect our time.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.866
To start these negotiations
on the right foot,

22:05.949 --> 22:08.368
I suggest we adjourn for the day
and start in earnest tomorrow.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.871
-On schedule?
-Um...

22:11.204 --> 22:13.707
-Okay?
-Fabulous. Princess Carolyn.

22:13.790 --> 22:14.833
Judah.

22:15.292 --> 22:19.004
-What the shell was that?
-Let the negotiations begin.

22:24.634 --> 22:29.723
[clears throat]
Todd, I, uh... owe you an apology.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.975
-Oh?
-[inhales, exhales]

22:32.059 --> 22:35.771
I know I was hard on you
when you were growing up,

22:35.937 --> 22:37.397
but I was trying to protect you.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.274
Nothing came easy for me.

22:39.358 --> 22:43.487
It took hard work, focus, discipline
to get me where I am today.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.906
Things didn't just work out.

22:45.989 --> 22:49.326
But I should have realized: you're white.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.495
I forgive you.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.579
She's awake.

22:52.662 --> 22:56.416
Do you wanna come say hello?
I'm sure she would love to see you.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.044
Well, she has my number.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.171
-That's cold, Todd.
-What do you expect?

23:01.254 --> 23:03.090
I'm a Chavez, right?

23:05.550 --> 23:06.468
Hmm...

23:08.929 --> 23:10.889
[groans]

23:10.972 --> 23:13.850
-Huh? Where am I?
-You're at Partridges,

23:13.934 --> 23:16.019
the rehab clinic
founded by Danny Bonaduce.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.855
-What about Pastiches?
-I told them I was checking you in here.

23:18.939 --> 23:19.940
Why would you do that?

23:20.023 --> 23:22.150
Those people need me
to be an example of success.

23:22.359 --> 23:25.070
You can't help anybody else
unless you're honest with yourself.

23:25.278 --> 23:28.031
-A wise man told me that.
-Who? What wise man?

23:28.115 --> 23:30.242
You did.
I was being poetic and you ruined it.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.452
Well, don't listen to me. I'm a drunk!

23:32.536 --> 23:34.788
Yeah. But the first step is admitting it.

23:34.871 --> 23:38.583
You've destroyed me.
I can never go back to Pastiches now.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.460
My husband will leave me.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.713
I promised him I would never drink again
after what happened to our daughter.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.882
Uh... What happened to your daughter?

23:45.966 --> 23:49.970
You know nothing of my life
and you think you know what's best for me?

23:50.053 --> 23:52.139
The only reason I got drunk
in the first place

23:52.222 --> 23:54.015
is because of your contraband vodka!

23:54.099 --> 23:57.185
-Well, yes, technically, that's true.
-Of course you did this to me.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.312
Because I cared about you.

23:59.396 --> 24:02.065
And you ruin people who care about you.

24:02.357 --> 24:04.109
[exhales] Well, best of luck.

24:04.276 --> 24:08.780
I want you to remember this, BoJack.
I want you to remember what you did to me.

24:10.782 --> 24:14.494
I remember everything. I'm sober now.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.621
