03:56.954 --> 03:58.055
Hey, little brother.

03:58.089 --> 03:59.256
Hey, big brother.

03:59.290 --> 04:01.993
Are you scared?

04:02.026 --> 04:03.593
Well, if you ever get scared,

04:03.626 --> 04:05.863
just remember
I'll always be right here.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.035
I have an idea.

04:11.068 --> 04:12.103
Come here.

04:14.038 --> 04:15.638
Put this on.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.108
As long as you have this on,
you'll be safe

04:17.141 --> 04:18.942
because I'll be with you.

04:18.976 --> 04:21.879
It's like big brother magic.

04:28.953 --> 04:31.288
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

04:45.336 --> 04:47.570
We're here. Come on.

04:47.604 --> 04:49.006
That's it. Here.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.209
Now, you boys remember
what I taught you.

04:52.243 --> 04:53.676
Make sure you look
after your brother.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.912
Yes, sir.

04:54.945 --> 04:56.313
Put your boots on.

05:00.051 --> 05:02.853
You wait for my signal. Okay?

05:11.128 --> 05:12.329
Go.

05:24.108 --> 05:25.976
Mom?

05:28.946 --> 05:30.247
Duncan!

05:30.281 --> 05:33.184
Jacob.

05:33.217 --> 05:35.119
I love you.

05:35.152 --> 05:36.987
Come on.

05:40.057 --> 05:41.724
Come on.

05:47.131 --> 05:48.966
Stay.

05:57.074 --> 06:01.145
Hey, when I say go, you run.
You don't look up.

06:01.178 --> 06:02.947
- You don't stop running.
- No!

06:02.980 --> 06:05.983
It's just like Pa taught us,
okay?

06:06.016 --> 06:08.018
Hmm, no.

06:08.052 --> 06:10.121
Okay.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.126
Now.

07:02.473 --> 07:04.375
I thought they got you.

07:04.408 --> 07:06.210
I know.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.072
Time to go.

07:35.105 --> 07:36.207
Boys!

07:36.240 --> 07:37.808
- Now.
- Come on.

07:37.841 --> 07:39.510
Come on here.

07:41.312 --> 07:42.479
Come on.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.851
Mama!

07:47.885 --> 07:49.153
- Mama!
- No, no, no, no.

07:49.186 --> 07:51.388
- Mom!
- We can't do this.

09:26.250 --> 09:27.584
Ah, damn it!

09:27.618 --> 09:30.321
Apologies. I...

09:30.354 --> 09:31.955
You got a death wish, boy?

09:31.989 --> 09:33.924
Because it's about to come true.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.028
Sorry, sir.
It was an accident.

09:38.062 --> 09:40.197
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come... Come on now, Earl.

09:40.230 --> 09:43.334
He don't want no trouble.

09:43.367 --> 09:44.803
Earl.

09:54.645 --> 09:59.249
Are you trying to tell me
this little pissant is a Dalton?

09:59.283 --> 10:01.385
He don't look like no Dalton.

10:04.655 --> 10:08.292
How about you tell me what you
think a Dalton looks like then?

10:12.463 --> 10:14.365
Hey, friend, now,
we're just funning,

10:14.398 --> 10:16.200
just having a little
playing with the kid.

10:16.233 --> 10:17.968
That's all.

10:18.001 --> 10:22.506
Hmm. If you want to keep
playing, we can keep playing.

10:31.415 --> 10:33.283
All good here.

10:33.317 --> 10:35.586
Come on.

10:40.691 --> 10:43.660
You boys have yourselves
a daisy of a day.

10:51.034 --> 10:53.637
Hey, little brother.

10:53.670 --> 10:55.005
Hey, big brother.

10:55.038 --> 10:58.709
You all right?

10:58.742 --> 11:01.478
Of course you are.

11:01.512 --> 11:03.714
I haven't seen you in a while.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.449
Hmm?

11:05.482 --> 11:09.720
Well, me and the gang
have been having some fun.

11:09.754 --> 11:13.457
You know, why don't you
come have a drink with us?

11:13.490 --> 11:16.460
I... I got a job to finish.

11:16.493 --> 11:18.562
Well, I'm sure that can wait,
can't it?

11:18.595 --> 11:24.668
I think, in fact,
it's break time.

11:30.340 --> 11:32.543
- Aw.
- Come on.

11:36.547 --> 11:43.353
Maybe, but what about...

11:43.387 --> 11:46.356
No. You're right.
You're right.

11:46.390 --> 11:48.992
I baked some more of that
fry bread y'all like,

11:49.026 --> 11:51.328
a little going-away treat.

11:51.361 --> 11:53.030
What, are you leaving already?

11:53.063 --> 11:55.666
Well, some folks aren't
too happy with the fun

11:55.699 --> 11:57.434
that we've been having,
so me and the gang,

11:57.468 --> 11:59.503
we're going to lay low
for a while.

12:02.139 --> 12:05.342
Hey. Come on.
I always come back.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.311
Sit down! Come on.
Have a drink.

12:07.344 --> 12:09.480
Sit next to the big man.

12:09.513 --> 12:11.482
He just got a fresh bear kill.

12:11.515 --> 12:13.116
With his, uh, bare hands.

12:13.150 --> 12:16.553
I'm okay. I'll just stand.

12:16.587 --> 12:18.422
New posters?

12:18.455 --> 12:20.624
Sheriff Russell brought them
in last month, upped the bounty.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.026
Well, about to go up again.

12:23.060 --> 12:24.495
Aw, $1,000?

12:24.528 --> 12:26.330
Come... Will you please
tell those fine men

12:26.363 --> 12:28.499
at the printing press
that my head is worth at least,

12:28.532 --> 12:30.367
um, well,
at least double that?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.636
Don't worry.
You'll catch up.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.404
Shit. Oh!

12:36.139 --> 12:38.442
I did not spill a drop!

12:41.612 --> 12:44.081
How much you squirreling away,
stud?

12:44.114 --> 12:46.517
Oh, I... I mean, I got a little
money, but I'm not, uh...

12:46.550 --> 12:48.385
Girl will deal you in.

12:48.418 --> 12:51.622
I can't. I'm...
I'm saving it.

12:51.655 --> 12:54.759
I'll play his hand.

12:54.792 --> 12:57.494
Saving up for
the family farm, huh?

12:57.528 --> 13:00.531
The past is the past.

13:00.564 --> 13:02.733
Let's leave it that way.

13:02.767 --> 13:04.434
You got to work here
for, what, 10 years,

13:04.468 --> 13:06.603
save up enough
to buy that little place?

13:06.637 --> 13:09.406
8 years, 11 months, 7 days.

13:09.439 --> 13:11.508
Damn, down to the day.

13:13.443 --> 13:15.546
You should really see it.

13:15.579 --> 13:17.114
I mean, they fixed it all up.

13:17.147 --> 13:18.382
It... It looks just like
when we were kids.

13:18.415 --> 13:19.817
You been going back out there?

13:25.757 --> 13:28.793
Duncan, it's Buck.

13:34.164 --> 13:36.199
God damn it, Buck,
you get out of that street

13:36.233 --> 13:37.467
and stop playing
with this man!

13:37.501 --> 13:39.503
Not today, Wylie.

13:53.785 --> 13:54.852
Draw!

13:59.489 --> 14:00.557
I got him!

14:00.591 --> 14:02.492
I got that son of a bitch!

14:11.401 --> 14:15.505
I thought they told you to stop
messing with that bounty man.

14:15.539 --> 14:18.675
That they did.

14:18.709 --> 14:21.244
You going to listen next time?

14:21.278 --> 14:22.914
Next time.

14:40.497 --> 14:42.165
I'm calling his Peacemaker.

14:45.803 --> 14:47.237
Well, shit.

14:47.270 --> 14:48.906
It's either me
or the undertaker.

14:52.709 --> 14:55.278
Rest in peace, brother.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.147
I'll see you there soon.

15:03.553 --> 15:04.956
Damn you, Buck.

15:04.989 --> 15:06.657
Now we're one short
for tomorrow.

15:06.690 --> 15:07.724
Yeah, I know.

15:07.759 --> 15:10.260
We may have to call it off.

15:10.293 --> 15:12.764
Why not get one of
them Burns boys?

15:12.797 --> 15:14.297
Oh, I don't know about that.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.266
They're stone-cold killers.

15:16.299 --> 15:19.736
Eh, that's not the best idea.

15:19.771 --> 15:21.271
Brenda, you didn't.

15:21.304 --> 15:23.540
Oh, I certainly did,

15:23.573 --> 15:26.276
both of them at the same time.

15:28.612 --> 15:32.950
Nevertheless, why does that
disqualify them from this then?

15:32.984 --> 15:34.685
Oh, it doesn't for me
personally.

15:34.718 --> 15:37.220
I mean, double the trouble
is double my pleasure.

15:37.254 --> 15:39.857
I'm just simply answering
your question is all,

15:39.891 --> 15:42.693
but do bear in mind
that after that,

15:42.726 --> 15:44.327
robbed them both blind.

15:47.865 --> 15:50.802
I'll do it.

15:50.835 --> 15:52.269
You'll do what?

15:52.302 --> 15:54.972
I'll help.

15:55.006 --> 15:58.308
- That could work.
- The hell it could.

15:58.341 --> 16:00.744
You seen them pelts in there.

16:00.778 --> 16:02.312
I shot those.

16:02.345 --> 16:03.881
I'm getting damn good, too.

16:03.915 --> 16:05.549
Yeah, you are,

16:05.582 --> 16:06.818
and you're earning yourself
an honest living.

16:06.851 --> 16:08.585
There's no reason to leave that.

16:08.618 --> 16:11.022
Well, you don't get to tell me
what to do anymore.

16:11.055 --> 16:13.290
You sure about that, boy?

16:13.323 --> 16:15.292
Look, Duncan, I...

16:15.325 --> 16:17.561
Man, I... I appreciate
everything you've done for me.

16:17.594 --> 16:20.832
You know I do.

16:20.865 --> 16:23.835
But I'm ready to do more.

16:27.704 --> 16:29.372
You know, and maybe my cut

16:29.406 --> 16:31.374
will be enough to buy back
Dad's farm.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.011
Forget about Vernon.
Forget about that damn farm.

16:34.045 --> 16:37.280
Stop calling him Vernon.

16:37.314 --> 16:38.916
He was your daddy, too.

16:42.787 --> 16:45.790
Hey.

16:45.823 --> 16:48.358
Let me do this.

16:48.391 --> 16:50.727
Lester.

16:52.096 --> 16:53.831
They'll figure it out.

16:53.865 --> 16:56.033
Hey.
Hey. What do y'all think?

16:56.067 --> 16:57.869
Huh?

17:01.705 --> 17:04.340
You look like shit.

17:04.374 --> 17:06.675
Son of a...

17:10.915 --> 17:12.715
Hear me out.

17:12.749 --> 17:14.416
We both know we got
a good team here.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.887
Mm-hmm.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.387
And this one promises to be
a very big score.

17:17.420 --> 17:19.623
Well, then, we do it
without him.

17:19.656 --> 17:23.727
Look, just a half-day past
Cordoba Canyon,

17:23.761 --> 17:25.061
there's an impasse
that they'll be crossing

17:25.096 --> 17:26.798
just before daylight,

17:26.830 --> 17:28.933
no one out that way for miles.

17:28.966 --> 17:33.838
Now, we make our positions
down the tree line

17:33.871 --> 17:36.841
on the east and west banks,

17:36.874 --> 17:39.010
and we'll be in
and out of there in flash.

17:39.043 --> 17:41.879
Hell, we've been down far
more difficult roads before.

17:41.913 --> 17:44.414
Well, I ain't putting him
in the middle of a firefight.

17:44.447 --> 17:46.050
And I ain't asking for that.

17:47.952 --> 17:54.025
Maybe we move Brenda
to Buck's spot, crowd control.

17:54.058 --> 17:56.393
Then Jake steps in
as horse wrangler,

17:56.426 --> 17:58.763
helps us beat a hasty retreat.

17:58.796 --> 18:02.066
He never even makes it
past the tree line.

18:02.099 --> 18:04.836
And if things go south?

18:04.869 --> 18:06.736
Then it wasn't what
the good Lord wanted,

18:06.771 --> 18:10.407
and we move on for the next.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.976
Have I ever been wrong?

18:13.743 --> 18:16.113
Yes, you have, several times.

18:16.147 --> 18:19.116
Well, you and me, we've been
through some shit though, right?

18:19.150 --> 18:21.118
We have.

18:21.152 --> 18:23.420
And here we are, still kicking.

18:23.453 --> 18:24.789
- Mm-hmm.
- So you trust me?

18:24.822 --> 18:26.924
Of course I trust you.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.860
It's never been about that.

18:28.893 --> 18:32.429
It's just, the kid
is the only family I got,

18:32.462 --> 18:33.798
and I didn't have a choice.

18:33.831 --> 18:36.868
I get it. I do.

18:36.901 --> 18:40.437
But Jake, he's old enough to be
making his own decisions.

18:40.470 --> 18:43.506
Just like his brother,
he can be pretty damn stubborn.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.142
No. No.

18:45.176 --> 18:47.778
Stubborn or not,
it's still my call.

18:47.812 --> 18:49.914
Thanks for proving my point.

21:08.119 --> 21:10.087
Howdy!

21:10.121 --> 21:12.023
The name's
Brenda Bertie Younger,

21:12.056 --> 21:13.924
at your service.

21:13.958 --> 21:15.893
Y'all stay calm,

21:15.926 --> 21:17.560
y'all stay breathing.

21:17.594 --> 21:18.628
Hey, give mama a little drink,
why don't you?

21:18.661 --> 21:22.166
Come on.

21:22.199 --> 21:23.300
Mm.

21:23.334 --> 21:24.634
More of a bourbon girl myself.

21:24.667 --> 21:27.038
Anybody got Thistle Dew?

21:27.071 --> 21:28.172
Oh, hi.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.340
Hey, mama.

22:03.374 --> 22:05.376
That's got to hurt.

22:07.111 --> 22:09.013
What the fuck is this?

22:13.150 --> 22:15.286
Where's the goddamn safe?

22:37.074 --> 22:40.010
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

22:40.044 --> 22:43.147
Just where you crawling off to?

22:43.180 --> 22:45.015
- You know.
- I don't know.

22:56.093 --> 22:58.028
You're injured.

23:01.832 --> 23:06.036
That's an awful lot of Pinks
for one goddamn box.

23:06.070 --> 23:08.439
Who you moving?

23:08.472 --> 23:10.407
Who the buyer?

23:10.441 --> 23:14.178
I don't know shit.

23:14.211 --> 23:18.715
You sure about that? Hmm?

23:18.748 --> 23:23.053
Call it a hunch, but I feel
like you might know something.

23:24.755 --> 23:27.690
I know you are fucked.

23:32.296 --> 23:33.663
You should go.

23:35.466 --> 23:37.301
Just go!

23:42.239 --> 23:44.074
Go!

23:50.481 --> 23:53.017
Open.

23:53.050 --> 23:54.752
Wider.

23:54.785 --> 23:57.388
Ah! Ah!

23:57.421 --> 24:01.358
Now, last chance.

24:02.426 --> 24:04.195
You can go to hell!

24:05.796 --> 24:08.165
Ah!

24:15.839 --> 24:17.441
Thought you might say that.

24:20.311 --> 24:22.346
You're already there now.

24:22.379 --> 24:23.948
Ah!

24:23.981 --> 24:27.051
Jake, what the hell
you doing out here?

24:27.084 --> 24:29.086
Let's go! Let's go!

25:00.517 --> 25:02.353
Let me do that.

25:14.832 --> 25:18.469
Well, who are you?

25:18.502 --> 25:20.471
My name is Pearl.

25:20.504 --> 25:23.474
Glad to know you, Pearl.

25:23.507 --> 25:27.244
Why'd they leave you shackled up
like that?

25:27.278 --> 25:28.979
I'm afraid I don't know.

25:29.013 --> 25:34.885
Um, these men just took me
from my home in Potemkin.

25:34.918 --> 25:36.553
Potemkin?

25:40.190 --> 25:42.326
What is it worth?

25:42.359 --> 25:44.895
Worth?

25:44.928 --> 25:46.463
I... I don't know, sir.

25:46.497 --> 25:50.234
I... I don't really know much of
anything that's going on.

25:50.267 --> 25:53.470
Nobody knows nothing, got it.

25:53.504 --> 25:54.571
Wait.

25:54.605 --> 25:56.440
You got something to say?

25:56.473 --> 25:59.310
- We can't just...
- Hey. Look, kid.

25:59.343 --> 26:00.944
People don't put people in boxes

26:00.978 --> 26:03.580
because they expect them
to behave themself, okay?

26:03.614 --> 26:06.550
I don't know her story,
and I don't give a shit.

26:06.583 --> 26:09.253
All we're going to do
is move her from here

26:09.286 --> 26:11.355
to there, collect our money.

26:11.388 --> 26:12.923
Alright?

26:12.956 --> 26:15.459
Seriously?

26:15.492 --> 26:17.494
We're still doing this?
She's just an innocent woman.

26:17.528 --> 26:18.929
Wylie,
help me understand

26:18.962 --> 26:20.197
what's happening here.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.499
I don't know.

26:22.533 --> 26:25.302
There was some extra security
on it, but to be frank,

26:25.336 --> 26:28.372
I expected a little more gold
and a little less girl.

26:28.405 --> 26:31.275
- God damn.
- Who's the buyer?

26:31.308 --> 26:33.911
I don't know him, uh,
some middle man

26:33.944 --> 26:36.447
with a whole lot of money,
I guess.

26:38.682 --> 26:43.620
Mather, Cotton Mather IV,
way up down this way.

26:43.654 --> 26:47.458
Being real secretive about
the whole thing.

26:50.027 --> 26:53.230
We can't do this.
Alright?

26:53.263 --> 26:54.965
We ain't going to sell her
to nobody.

26:54.998 --> 26:56.600
That ain't what we do.

26:56.633 --> 26:58.635
We're a bunch
of fucking outlaws.

26:58.669 --> 26:59.970
What are you even talking about?

27:00.003 --> 27:01.205
You know what I mean, Dodd.

27:01.238 --> 27:03.407
Well, there goes our big payday.

27:07.978 --> 27:10.514
If you take me to my home,

27:10.547 --> 27:13.250
there would be
a handsome reward.

27:16.587 --> 27:18.288
What the...

27:21.258 --> 27:22.526
You alright? Huh?

27:22.559 --> 27:24.561
You get hit?

27:24.595 --> 27:26.430
No.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.567
Oh, shit.

27:35.572 --> 27:37.441
Duncan!

27:37.474 --> 27:39.276
- Ah. Ah!
- Jesus.

27:41.311 --> 27:43.280
I know. I'm okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.349
- I'm okay.
- Duncan.

27:45.382 --> 27:46.683
I'm okay. I'm okay.

27:46.717 --> 27:48.685
Oh.

27:48.719 --> 27:50.621
She got me.

27:50.654 --> 27:52.589
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

27:52.623 --> 27:54.291
- Okay.
- Get me up.

27:54.324 --> 27:55.626
Help him up. Help him up.
Help him up.

27:55.659 --> 27:57.661
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Ah!

27:57.694 --> 28:00.297
Jesus.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.466
I'm alright. Where's my hat?
Where's my hat?

28:02.499 --> 28:04.668
Thanks, Lester.

28:04.701 --> 28:06.670
Ohhh.

28:06.703 --> 28:08.038
Alright. Get me to my horse.

28:08.071 --> 28:09.606
Get me to my horse.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.008
Come on.

28:11.041 --> 28:14.278
Alright.

28:14.311 --> 28:15.512
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

28:15.546 --> 28:17.181
- Ah!
- Oh, come on.

28:17.214 --> 28:18.348
Watch, he... Come on.
Oh, God damn.

28:18.382 --> 28:21.018
- Okay. Okay.
- God damn. Jesus.

28:21.051 --> 28:23.020
I got him.

28:23.053 --> 28:25.689
Got him.

28:25.722 --> 28:28.425
Wrap it tight. Come on.
Make it tight!

28:28.459 --> 28:30.461
- Alright. That's good.
- Okay.

28:30.494 --> 28:32.362
- Come on.
- Alright.

28:32.396 --> 28:33.497
That ain't my first rodeo.

28:33.530 --> 28:34.766
- Oh, hell, no.
- Come on.

28:34.799 --> 28:37.634
This way.

28:37.668 --> 28:39.303
Get! Get on it!

28:39.336 --> 28:40.304
Ohh.

28:40.337 --> 28:42.473
I got it. I got it.

28:42.506 --> 28:44.341
What can I do for you?

28:44.374 --> 28:46.043
You can go to your horse.

28:46.076 --> 28:47.544
- Go to your horse.
- Okay.

28:47.578 --> 28:49.112
Come on.

28:55.085 --> 28:57.789
Come here, little brother.

28:57.822 --> 29:00.624
It's just a graze.

29:00.657 --> 29:01.625
She just grazed me.

29:01.658 --> 29:03.494
I know she did.

29:03.527 --> 29:05.496
Brother magic. Alright?

29:05.529 --> 29:07.631
Yeah.
I'm going to be all right.

29:07.664 --> 29:10.768
I know.

29:10.802 --> 29:13.370
I got it.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.639
I got it, boy. We got to go.

29:15.672 --> 29:17.608
Come on.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.516
How long?

29:30.153 --> 29:33.423
Ah, shit.

29:33.457 --> 29:36.727
Macon is too far.

29:36.761 --> 29:38.529
Hey.

29:38.562 --> 29:42.366
You got any doctors
in that town of yours?

29:42.399 --> 29:44.167
Yes.

29:44.769 --> 29:47.805
[Mid-tempo music playing

31:52.729 --> 31:54.531
Let's hold up here.

31:54.564 --> 31:57.300
Get him off his horse
and rest it for a bit.

31:57.334 --> 31:59.236
Okay, lady.
You heard the man.

31:59.269 --> 32:00.237
This is your stop.

32:00.270 --> 32:02.606
Her name is Pearl.

32:02.639 --> 32:04.207
See, kid?
That's the problem.

32:04.241 --> 32:07.244
You name them,
you start to get attached.

32:07.277 --> 32:09.613
- Which way to the doctor?
- I can take you.

32:09.646 --> 32:11.548
No, that ain't going to be
the way this works.

32:11.581 --> 32:13.283
Dodd's right. You point in
the direction of the doc,

32:13.316 --> 32:14.919
we go get him.

32:18.655 --> 32:21.558
Truman, Chief, go check the town
and get the doc.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.593
Hell, find anyone who can help.

32:41.879 --> 32:43.714
I'm going to
take him back here.

32:58.662 --> 33:02.900
Hey.
Hey, help is on the way, okay?

33:02.934 --> 33:04.769
I'm sorry, Duncan.

33:08.705 --> 33:10.674
It's all my fault.

33:12.877 --> 33:16.346
No, you don't understand.
I...

33:16.379 --> 33:18.916
I saw her.

33:18.950 --> 33:22.787
She was right there,
I saw her, and I...

33:22.820 --> 33:24.654
I know.

33:26.723 --> 33:28.358
You know?

33:28.391 --> 33:30.560
I know.

33:32.629 --> 33:36.333
I...

33:36.366 --> 33:38.735
I just... I couldn't.

33:38.770 --> 33:40.704
I couldn't pull the trigger.

33:42.405 --> 33:45.042
I'm glad you couldn't do it.

33:45.076 --> 33:47.344
I'm glad you couldn't do it.

33:55.086 --> 33:57.621
How's he doing?

33:57.654 --> 34:00.925
He lost a lot of blood.

34:00.958 --> 34:03.060
He wants to see you.

34:14.806 --> 34:16.808
Hell of a situation
we got going here.

34:16.841 --> 34:19.944
Don't talk.
Keep your energy.

34:19.976 --> 34:23.781
Wylie, y-you've always been...

34:23.815 --> 34:26.117
you've always been
a good number two,

34:26.150 --> 34:27.952
and I trust you with my life.

34:27.985 --> 34:31.388
But until we get out of this,
Lester is in charge.

34:31.420 --> 34:33.024
You hear me?

34:36.860 --> 34:38.129
And you... you do me a favor.

34:38.161 --> 34:40.097
You take care of my brother,
okay?

34:43.433 --> 34:45.870
On my life.

34:45.902 --> 34:47.670
Mine too.

35:02.887 --> 35:04.021
Is this necessary?

35:04.055 --> 35:05.689
It's necessary.

35:05.722 --> 35:06.991
Oh, come on, man.

35:07.024 --> 35:09.961
Greenhorn here
seems to forget

35:09.994 --> 35:12.797
that a bunch of armed Pinkertons

35:12.830 --> 35:16.399
found it necessary
to shackle his new friend

35:16.433 --> 35:17.734
and lock her in a box.

35:17.768 --> 35:19.436
Maybe she didn't
do nothing wrong.

35:19.469 --> 35:23.007
Or maybe this is all a trap,

35:23.040 --> 35:26.811
and I ain't about to let
what happened to your brother

35:26.844 --> 35:29.146
happen in vain, you understand?

35:34.752 --> 35:36.754
Ain't nothing out there
but more woods.

35:36.787 --> 35:38.588
Fuck this.

35:38.622 --> 35:41.759
So, what? So this building,
this... this is your town?

35:41.792 --> 35:43.861
I offered to take you.

35:45.897 --> 35:47.932
She obviously
can't be trusted.

35:47.965 --> 35:49.532
Keep an eye on her.

35:49.566 --> 35:51.869
I'm going to take a look around,
God damn it.

35:54.839 --> 35:58.142
Where have you brought us?

35:58.175 --> 35:59.977
Brenda?

36:01.946 --> 36:03.848
Ride hard to this outpost

36:03.881 --> 36:06.183
and get a doctor
or medical supplies or whatever,

36:06.217 --> 36:08.052
and get back here fast.

36:35.246 --> 36:37.048
The fuck, man?!

36:39.516 --> 36:42.186
You should be more careful.

36:42.219 --> 36:44.587
Y'all were close.

36:44.621 --> 36:48.525
You know, you could be nicer.

36:48.558 --> 36:50.795
How you mean like?
In general?

36:50.828 --> 36:52.096
I think you know what I mean.

36:52.129 --> 36:54.799
Yeah.

36:54.832 --> 36:59.236
But I know that you know
that this is all fucked.

36:59.270 --> 37:01.806
Yeah? Yeah.

37:05.843 --> 37:08.946
Say, man, you got
another one of those?

37:08.980 --> 37:10.948
Yeah, sure. Hold on.

37:13.050 --> 37:17.121
For one of them little jerkies I
know you got stashed somewhere.

37:17.154 --> 37:20.191
Oh, shit, man.

37:20.224 --> 37:22.026
Yeah, sure.

37:25.863 --> 37:27.865
Help yourself.

37:27.898 --> 37:29.266
Ooh.

37:40.111 --> 37:42.279
I knew it!
I fucking knew it!

37:42.313 --> 37:44.281
Where is she?
Where is the goddamn girl?

37:44.315 --> 37:45.883
What the hell?

37:45.916 --> 37:47.251
She was right there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

37:47.284 --> 37:48.853
What are you doing?

37:48.886 --> 37:50.855
He helped her.

37:50.888 --> 37:53.623
- What?
- Now, look.

37:53.656 --> 37:55.960
We can all trust
each other here.

37:55.993 --> 37:57.862
- Can we?
- Uh-huh.

37:57.895 --> 37:59.696
Bullshit.

37:59.729 --> 38:02.133
I should just put a bullet
right through your fucking head.

38:02.166 --> 38:05.136
I think you should
back the fuck off.

38:05.169 --> 38:07.872
That's what I think
you should do.

38:07.905 --> 38:09.874
Alright.

38:09.907 --> 38:12.877
I see you still playing
the dead daddy role, now?

38:12.910 --> 38:14.178
Is that it?

38:15.612 --> 38:17.314
Mother is waiting for you.

38:22.219 --> 38:24.889
How did you get loose?

38:24.922 --> 38:26.689
Did you just say mother?

38:26.723 --> 38:28.658
Your friend is dying.

38:28.691 --> 38:30.061
- Do you want help or not?
- Yes.

38:30.094 --> 38:34.265
The help is this way,
to the brothel.

38:35.732 --> 38:37.334
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:37.368 --> 38:40.071
Oh, now we're just going
to follow her, now?

38:43.240 --> 38:44.674
She did say brothel.

38:53.650 --> 38:55.086
How much further?

38:55.119 --> 38:56.653
Not far.

38:56.686 --> 38:58.989
Town square is just ahead.

39:04.995 --> 39:06.964
This way.

39:13.437 --> 39:16.273
Nothing out here,
huh, Truman?

39:16.307 --> 39:19.009
None of this was here,
I swear.

39:27.017 --> 39:28.953
Are you enjoying your present?

39:28.986 --> 39:30.387
It's the best.

39:32.689 --> 39:34.959
Where are my manners?

39:34.992 --> 39:36.427
This is Duncan.

39:36.460 --> 39:37.694
He's been injured.

39:37.727 --> 39:39.430
On your daring rescue?

39:39.463 --> 39:43.200
Yes, ma'am,
it was quite an ordeal.

39:43.234 --> 39:45.035
Help this man.

40:17.268 --> 40:21.172
Gentlemen, please,
make yourselves at home.

40:21.205 --> 40:24.775
Let's get a bed ready
for this nice man.

40:35.119 --> 40:39.023
Oh, and I understand
there was a reward involved.

40:39.056 --> 40:40.391
Of course.

40:40.424 --> 40:44.328
A handsome sum
for these handsome men.

40:46.297 --> 40:49.466
You boys enjoy yourselves while
we take care of your friend.

41:01.845 --> 41:03.514
Oh, hey, um,

41:03.547 --> 41:05.115
good luck getting him to talk.

41:20.464 --> 41:22.433
Hey, little brother.

41:22.466 --> 41:25.369
Hey, big brother.

41:25.402 --> 41:26.870
They said they're going to
take care of you.

41:26.904 --> 41:28.472
- Mm-hmm.
- Fix you up good.

41:28.505 --> 41:30.174
Mm.

41:30.207 --> 41:34.478
Just in case things
don't work out in the end.

41:34.511 --> 41:36.447
Don't say that, that's not...

41:36.480 --> 41:39.783
You keep it with you, okay?

41:39.817 --> 41:43.387
Brother magic ain't going to
make me a better-looking corpse.

42:20.624 --> 42:23.494
Your seed is in another.

42:23.527 --> 42:25.396
It's a boy.

42:40.611 --> 42:42.413
Jacob.

42:47.618 --> 42:49.253
Are you okay?

42:49.286 --> 42:51.221
Yeah.
I... I just... I heard a noise.

42:51.255 --> 42:53.524
Let's allow the boys
to have their fun.

42:56.327 --> 42:57.494
Okay.

43:19.650 --> 43:22.386
Let me bathe you first, honey?

43:22.419 --> 43:24.054
Oh, no, baby.

43:24.088 --> 43:26.490
See, let me tell you something
about myself.

43:26.523 --> 43:29.460
Dodd, he like it dirty.

43:50.981 --> 43:52.983
Pour you one?

43:53.016 --> 43:54.251
Uh, no, thank you, ma'am.

43:54.284 --> 43:56.887
Just one, take the edge off.

44:03.026 --> 44:08.499
All the men you came in with had
but one thing on their minds.

44:08.532 --> 44:11.502
I... I guess I was just worried
about my brother.

44:13.704 --> 44:16.607
I get the feeling it's more
than that with you.

44:18.475 --> 44:21.478
I'm sorry, I-I don't mean
to be rude, ma'am, but they...

44:21.512 --> 44:25.516
they're just not my type.

44:25.549 --> 44:27.351
Oh.

44:30.421 --> 44:32.356
I won't say anything.

44:35.726 --> 44:37.461
Have you ever been with a...?

44:37.494 --> 44:39.263
No.

44:39.296 --> 44:41.932
Don't see that
around these parts much.

44:50.407 --> 44:55.312
So, outlaw brothers.

44:55.345 --> 44:58.015
This is just a one-time thing.

44:58.048 --> 45:01.084
This life not for you?

45:01.118 --> 45:06.423
I'm just out of place here.

45:06.457 --> 45:08.592
Couldn't even pull the trigger.

45:14.766 --> 45:18.535
You have never taken a life?

45:18.569 --> 45:20.404
No.

45:22.473 --> 45:25.042
One of life's true innocents.

45:26.743 --> 45:31.682
You're a sweet boy the way
you take care of your brother.

45:31.715 --> 45:36.553
Well, he's always
taken care of me.

45:36.587 --> 45:40.090
I think there's only two kinds
of family...

45:40.123 --> 45:42.659
the one you're born into

45:42.693 --> 45:45.629
and the ones you find
along the way.

45:45.662 --> 45:48.432
Yeah, Lester's like that for me.

45:51.068 --> 45:55.639
After my parents died,

45:55.672 --> 45:58.442
he's always looked after me.

45:58.475 --> 46:01.445
That's what my girls did for me.

46:01.478 --> 46:04.414
There was some bad men,

46:04.448 --> 46:07.084
and they tried to do me harm
once.

46:07.117 --> 46:09.353
Mm.

46:09.386 --> 46:13.657
But these girls,
they risked their lives for me.

46:13.690 --> 46:18.729
They took me into their family
on the day that Pearl was born.

46:20.697 --> 46:23.700
May I ask what happened?

46:23.734 --> 46:25.435
Come with me.

47:14.484 --> 47:16.587
The most beautiful girl.

47:16.620 --> 47:19.656
Let go!
What are you doing?

47:19.690 --> 47:20.858
Let go of me!

47:20.892 --> 47:22.559
Let go!

47:22.593 --> 47:24.127
Let... No!

47:24.161 --> 47:26.597
Let go of me! N... No!

47:26.630 --> 47:28.665
Do not be deceived.

47:28.699 --> 47:31.201
That there is a devil.

47:31.234 --> 47:34.438
Cotton, please,

47:34.471 --> 47:37.842
just let me have my baby,
then you can take me.

47:37.875 --> 47:40.845
Please, Cotton.

47:40.878 --> 47:41.846
String her up.

47:41.879 --> 47:44.748
No! No!

47:44.782 --> 47:46.516
No!

47:46.550 --> 47:48.652
No, don't hurt my baby!

47:53.223 --> 47:55.559
Good people of Potemkin,

47:55.592 --> 47:58.195
I have traveled many miles
from the town of Salem

47:58.228 --> 48:00.497
in search of this vile woman,

48:00.530 --> 48:04.668
who shall escape
God's wrath no more.

48:04.701 --> 48:07.170
She who stands before you
is among the last

48:07.204 --> 48:09.640
of a rotten breed.

48:09.673 --> 48:12.476
One of the most impudent,
scurrilous,

48:12.509 --> 48:14.611
wicked creatures in the world.

48:14.645 --> 48:16.546
They which sin must go
to their father

48:16.580 --> 48:19.216
the devil
into everlasting burning.

48:19.249 --> 48:20.918
They which never pray,

48:20.952 --> 48:23.855
God will pour out His wrath
upon them.

48:23.888 --> 48:26.189
And when they bed and pray
in hellfire,

48:26.223 --> 48:27.925
God will not forgive them.

48:27.959 --> 48:29.894
For there they must lie forever.

48:29.927 --> 48:33.296
I ask the rest of you,
are you willing to go to Hell

48:33.330 --> 48:35.666
and burn with the devil
and his angels?

48:37.969 --> 48:41.538
As you and the abomination
that lives inside you

48:41.571 --> 48:43.240
have been
found guilty of witchcraft

48:43.273 --> 48:45.709
and must immediately
be put to death.

48:45.742 --> 48:48.278
Your burning will continue
in the lake of fire

48:48.311 --> 48:49.881
for all eternity.

49:31.621 --> 49:33.891
Don't be afraid, Jacob.

49:35.860 --> 49:36.994
And that was you?

49:37.028 --> 49:38.930
The day I was born.

49:43.633 --> 49:46.269
But... But you were burned?

49:46.303 --> 49:48.005
We all burned.

49:48.039 --> 49:50.908
It was the worst pain
I've ever felt.

49:56.680 --> 50:00.017
And in just a few hours,

50:00.051 --> 50:05.722
it'll be exactly two centuries
ago on this very day.

50:39.656 --> 50:41.926
Guys! Guys!

50:41.959 --> 50:43.693
Dodd!

50:43.727 --> 50:45.763
- Go away!
- Dodd, get out here!

50:45.797 --> 50:47.531
Come on!

50:47.564 --> 50:49.033
I've given you enough pointers,
do you understand?

50:49.066 --> 50:50.400
No, it's...

50:50.433 --> 50:52.435
I apologize for that, princess.

50:53.938 --> 50:57.707
Don't stop.
I thought Dodd liked it dirty.

51:13.991 --> 51:15.993
What the fuck?

52:05.843 --> 52:08.980
Bitch! Bitch!

52:31.035 --> 52:32.003
Kid!

52:32.036 --> 52:33.804
Where the fuck you going?

53:06.237 --> 53:07.470
Come on, get up!

53:07.504 --> 53:08.538
Come on.

53:08.571 --> 53:10.207
Sure, right.

53:25.222 --> 53:27.058
Let's go!

53:52.917 --> 53:54.218
They have Duncan.

53:57.587 --> 53:59.256
Come on!

54:50.107 --> 54:53.077
You may kill the others,

54:53.110 --> 54:55.179
but bring the boy to me.

55:16.367 --> 55:18.869
Let's go! Let's go!

55:32.049 --> 55:35.286
What the fuck just happened?

55:35.319 --> 55:37.687
We got to get the fuck
out of this town.

55:37.720 --> 55:40.925
Not by horseback we ain't.

55:40.958 --> 55:42.659
What about the others?
They dead?

55:42.692 --> 55:44.261
Yes, they dead.

55:44.295 --> 55:46.330
Were you just coming
from the same brothel as I was?

55:46.363 --> 55:48.099
You left us.

55:48.132 --> 55:50.134
Yeah, well, you know,
the door was right there.

55:50.167 --> 55:52.269
But I just saved you now, so...

55:52.303 --> 55:55.106
They had the drop on us,

55:55.139 --> 55:58.309
and they just let us go.

55:58.342 --> 56:00.244
By all accounts
we shouldn't even be alive.

56:00.277 --> 56:02.113
They killed plenty.

56:04.081 --> 56:05.816
And Duncan?

56:05.850 --> 56:08.953
They were helping him,
and then all this shit happened,

56:08.986 --> 56:10.988
and then he was gone.

56:11.021 --> 56:12.990
It all happened so fast.
I don't know.

56:13.023 --> 56:14.158
Doesn't make any sense.

56:14.191 --> 56:16.994
None of this shit
makes any sense.

56:17.027 --> 56:20.264
Maria told me that
she was burned to death

56:20.297 --> 56:22.399
the day Pearl was born
200 years ago today.

56:22.433 --> 56:26.170
You know, kid, if you had said
that on any other given day,

56:26.203 --> 56:30.374
I just assume you been kicked
in the head by a horse.

56:30.407 --> 56:32.209
I think they need me.

56:37.381 --> 56:41.051
The Lord protects the righteous,
not the wicked.

56:43.187 --> 56:49.160
So, we have something they want
and we can use that.

56:49.193 --> 56:51.028
He's not a poker chip, Dodd.

56:51.061 --> 56:52.729
No, but he's an advantage,

56:52.763 --> 56:55.199
and from where we stand,

56:55.232 --> 56:58.302
we could use more like that.

56:58.335 --> 56:59.702
What about Duncan?

56:59.736 --> 57:01.238
You said he was already gone.

57:01.272 --> 57:04.241
Gone. That doesn't mean
he's dead.

57:04.275 --> 57:08.012
Let go.

57:08.045 --> 57:09.780
I don't know, son.

57:09.813 --> 57:12.049
We ain't got a lot of options.

57:12.082 --> 57:13.184
Alright?

57:13.217 --> 57:16.120
They got the jump on us before.

57:16.153 --> 57:20.057
Now we know what we up against,
and we got the kid.

57:21.525 --> 57:24.727
Look, Jake, you know
how much I loved your brother.

57:24.762 --> 57:25.829
No, stop.

57:25.863 --> 57:28.299
I'm not leaving without him.

57:31.268 --> 57:35.239
He made you promise, both of
you, to protect me, right?

57:35.272 --> 57:37.740
That's exactly what we're doing.

57:37.775 --> 57:41.378
I'm going either way,

57:41.412 --> 57:44.515
so if you two want to
keep that promise,

57:44.548 --> 57:47.218
maybe you best follow.

57:49.253 --> 57:51.855
Well, look at the kid, huh?

57:54.458 --> 57:59.263
Well, look, man, I mean, if
we going to die in this anyway,

57:59.296 --> 58:02.333
I suppose we take
some of them with us.

58:08.539 --> 58:10.841
So, we actually doing this?

58:10.874 --> 58:15.145
Ah, shit.

58:15.179 --> 58:16.814
Really?

58:16.847 --> 58:20.351
I tell you what,

58:20.384 --> 58:23.287
I got a special one
for the birthday girl.

58:30.861 --> 58:32.496
Okay.

58:34.431 --> 58:37.835
So how do we get the fuck
out of here?

58:53.550 --> 58:55.352
They're gone.

59:02.493 --> 59:05.195
This is just one big
fucking game to them.

59:06.597 --> 59:09.566
I'm done figuring shit out.

59:11.402 --> 59:13.203
I got you.

59:28.585 --> 59:31.355
You are so beautiful.

59:37.961 --> 59:40.464
You all are.

59:40.497 --> 59:44.268
The woman at the stake,
cut her down.

59:44.301 --> 59:46.270
The sacrifice is complete.

59:46.303 --> 59:50.474
Please, give her
a proper burial.

59:50.507 --> 59:53.243
Jacob,

59:53.277 --> 59:57.481
the sweet boy
that my daughter ensnared,

59:57.514 --> 59:59.883
he is special...

59:59.917 --> 01:00:05.356
uncorrupted, innocent blood.

01:00:05.389 --> 01:00:10.461
He alone can sustain us
for decades.

01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:13.297
Oh.

01:00:25.442 --> 01:00:27.878
Come on. Keep moving.

01:00:41.992 --> 01:00:43.594
It's empty.

01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:57.941
Your first kill... a door.

01:00:57.975 --> 01:00:59.276
Stay close.

01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:07.551
What the...?

01:01:14.725 --> 01:01:16.059
Where the hell are we?

01:01:16.093 --> 01:01:17.428
I don't know.

01:01:17.461 --> 01:01:19.563
I was hoping you could tell me.

01:01:19.596 --> 01:01:24.635
Stepped in the door,
and here I am.

01:01:24.668 --> 01:01:26.603
Yeah, well, I done had

01:01:26.637 --> 01:01:30.374
about just enough
of this strange shit.

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:33.310
Where are you going?

01:01:33.343 --> 01:01:34.445
That way.

01:01:34.478 --> 01:01:35.712
Hm.

01:01:35.746 --> 01:01:37.614
You know where this leads?

01:01:37.648 --> 01:01:39.349
Look here, Wylie.

01:01:39.383 --> 01:01:41.351
One way is just as good
as the next out here,

01:01:41.385 --> 01:01:43.353
so I picks that way.

01:01:55.632 --> 01:01:57.067
Watch it, kid.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.635
I know.

01:02:13.517 --> 01:02:15.619
- Duncan?
- Jesus, kid.

01:02:15.652 --> 01:02:18.522
You ever hear of the element
of surprise?

01:02:18.555 --> 01:02:19.623
Sorry.

01:02:19.656 --> 01:02:21.458
Duncan, you here?

01:02:21.492 --> 01:02:22.659
What about surprise?

01:02:22.693 --> 01:02:25.629
Yeah, there's nobody here, kid.

01:02:25.662 --> 01:02:28.465
I'm not sure if that
makes it better or worse.

01:02:36.139 --> 01:02:38.342
Where did Lester and Wylie go?

01:02:50.721 --> 01:02:53.357
Let's take a minute.

01:02:58.462 --> 01:03:00.832
It just goes on forever.

01:03:00.865 --> 01:03:02.466
Yeah.

01:03:02.499 --> 01:03:05.736
These stars,
they're just a little off.

01:03:11.642 --> 01:03:15.045
I think I know now why Duncan
put you in charge.

01:03:17.481 --> 01:03:19.383
Look, listen, I do the...

01:03:19.416 --> 01:03:23.755
No, no, I was bothered by it
before, but now I get it.

01:03:26.456 --> 01:03:28.659
He did it because he thought
he was dying.

01:03:30.427 --> 01:03:34.832
And I'm the closest thing
that boy has got to a daddy.

01:03:34.866 --> 01:03:37.434
Now, I know y'all done been
through some...

01:03:37.467 --> 01:03:41.471
some shit,
but me and those boys,

01:03:41.505 --> 01:03:43.373
we go way back.

01:03:47.744 --> 01:03:49.580
Hold it.

01:03:50.815 --> 01:03:52.716
Come on.
Let's keep walking.

01:04:12.669 --> 01:04:15.606
You boys need to learn
how to announce yourself.

01:04:15.639 --> 01:04:17.674
Yeah, you didn't announce
yourself neither,

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:18.742
and where the hell did you go?

01:04:18.776 --> 01:04:20.744
We turned around, you gone.

01:04:20.778 --> 01:04:22.746
We tried to follow you,
but whatever door

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:26.884
we went through
wasn't the same as yours.

01:04:26.918 --> 01:04:29.821
I take it you two didn't find
Duncan either.

01:04:29.854 --> 01:04:32.890
It ain't nothing
but a dust-covered ghost town,

01:04:32.924 --> 01:04:34.491
like we was never there.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.630
Now, I know that's not you boys
out there.

01:04:39.663 --> 01:04:42.566
We're just a bunch
of sitting ducks right here.

01:04:42.599 --> 01:04:45.469
They're fucking with us,
boys.

01:04:45.502 --> 01:04:46.771
The church.

01:04:46.804 --> 01:04:47.905
What?

01:04:47.939 --> 01:04:49.673
We need to get to the church.

01:04:52.275 --> 01:04:54.511
Got it.

01:04:54.544 --> 01:04:55.712
This way.

01:04:55.746 --> 01:04:57.614
The church.

01:05:37.587 --> 01:05:39.222
Follow me.

01:05:39.256 --> 01:05:42.894
Going back to the church
seems like a good idea.

01:05:42.927 --> 01:05:44.728
Follow me.

01:06:08.285 --> 01:06:10.353
Alright.

01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:16.861
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:18.662
Oh, shit.

01:06:25.635 --> 01:06:27.637
What are you doing?

01:06:31.776 --> 01:06:33.710
They're out there.

01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:39.784
I don't think
they can come in here.

01:07:09.746 --> 01:07:12.850
All we want is Jacob.

01:07:12.884 --> 01:07:18.823
In exchange, we will give you
money, women, and safe passage.

01:07:19.891 --> 01:07:21.058
Why me?

01:07:21.092 --> 01:07:23.593
Your pure blood is the key.

01:07:25.797 --> 01:07:27.064
There's nowhere to go.

01:07:27.098 --> 01:07:29.399
Hey! Hey!

01:07:29.432 --> 01:07:30.634
Get fucked.

01:07:30.667 --> 01:07:31.836
You don't get the kid.

01:07:31.869 --> 01:07:33.905
You sure as fuck don't get me.

01:07:36.706 --> 01:07:38.408
What the fuck? Come on.

01:07:38.441 --> 01:07:40.878
Come on in.

01:07:40.912 --> 01:07:42.712
Come on.

01:07:48.052 --> 01:07:49.653
Hey.

01:07:49.686 --> 01:07:51.621
They're gone.

01:07:58.728 --> 01:08:00.898
Hey, maybe they got scared.

01:08:00.932 --> 01:08:04.401
Well, maybe not, but they gone.

01:08:17.081 --> 01:08:19.116
We've got to get the hell
out of here.

01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:21.451
- We have a plan.
- No, no.

01:08:21.484 --> 01:08:24.087
Sitting here forever
ain't a plan.

01:08:24.121 --> 01:08:28.960
They can't get inside,
so sacred ground, maybe.

01:08:28.993 --> 01:08:30.060
House of God.

01:08:30.094 --> 01:08:32.897
House of God?

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:34.932
This is a coffin, boys.
Alright?

01:08:34.966 --> 01:08:37.434
Now, they're going to be
coming back in here,

01:08:37.466 --> 01:08:39.770
and when they do, they're going
to be killing y'all

01:08:39.804 --> 01:08:41.805
because you all are the ones
decided to live here.

01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:43.573
More like die here.

01:08:43.607 --> 01:08:47.044
Maybe they can't get in here,
and maybe they can.

01:08:47.078 --> 01:08:49.814
All I know is,
they're not in here right now,

01:08:49.846 --> 01:08:54.051
and that is just fine by me.

01:08:54.085 --> 01:08:56.120
They out there
plotting something.

01:08:56.153 --> 01:08:58.022
I can feel it.

01:08:58.055 --> 01:08:59.890
And what do you think
they're up to?

01:08:59.924 --> 01:09:01.091
Now, how the fuck should I know?

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:02.492
They love you so much.

01:09:02.524 --> 01:09:03.526
You tell me.

01:09:10.533 --> 01:09:13.502
Hey. Hey.

01:09:13.536 --> 01:09:16.473
What? No.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:09:16.506 --> 01:09:19.944
Hey, stop. Stop it.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:09:19.977 --> 01:09:22.179
Hey.

01:09:22.212 --> 01:09:23.513
Come on. Come on.

01:09:23.546 --> 01:09:25.816
Come on.

01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:28.085
Hey.

01:09:28.118 --> 01:09:29.987
Hey.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.421
Hey.

01:09:36.993 --> 01:09:39.930
I'm so hungry.

01:09:39.964 --> 01:09:42.099
Hey.

01:09:42.133 --> 01:09:43.935
I'm so hungry.

01:11:02.913 --> 01:11:05.548
Dodd was right.
I shouldn't be here.

01:11:05.582 --> 01:11:07.251
Your brother knew the risk.

01:11:09.586 --> 01:11:12.156
He wanted better for you.

01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:14.158
He didn't want you to live
with that soldier's heart.

01:11:14.191 --> 01:11:17.627
I'm so sick of hearing that.

01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:20.164
There was something else
going on.

01:11:20.197 --> 01:11:23.234
He'd never...
never talk about it,

01:11:23.267 --> 01:11:26.603
but I know he blamed Pa
for what happened.

01:11:26.636 --> 01:11:30.875
Yeah, he did.

01:11:30.908 --> 01:11:32.642
And he was right.

01:11:32.675 --> 01:11:33.944
What?

01:11:33.978 --> 01:11:37.181
There's a reason
those people came there.

01:11:37.214 --> 01:11:41.919
Yeah. Yeah, for our money
and our... our horses.

01:11:41.952 --> 01:11:43.254
- No. No.
- And then you and Duncan

01:11:43.287 --> 01:11:45.089
went and got revenge
for our family.

01:11:45.122 --> 01:11:46.656
No.

01:11:46.689 --> 01:11:50.061
That's just what we told you.

01:11:50.094 --> 01:11:52.997
They didn't take anything.

01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:57.201
Son, those people
came for blood.

01:12:02.373 --> 01:12:05.943
Why?

01:12:05.976 --> 01:12:07.912
Why?

01:12:10.247 --> 01:12:14.285
Now, there's nobody can stop me
from telling you this,

01:12:14.318 --> 01:12:17.154
but you is old enough
now to hear the truth.

01:12:17.188 --> 01:12:19.890
What are you talking about,
Lester?

01:12:22.126 --> 01:12:25.695
Your daddy never made
a good rancher.

01:12:25.728 --> 01:12:30.000
Matter of fact,
he was horrible at that shit.

01:12:30.034 --> 01:12:32.269
I was better than he was.

01:12:32.303 --> 01:12:34.171
I had more experience.

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:39.343
I learned from my old owner.

01:12:41.412 --> 01:12:44.014
So I helped him out
as much as I could,

01:12:45.715 --> 01:12:51.188
but he was the man that made me
a free man, but I...

01:12:53.224 --> 01:12:56.260
I didn't always
feel that way.

01:12:56.293 --> 01:12:59.263
I don't know what you're saying,
Lester.

01:13:04.301 --> 01:13:08.272
They forced me to do things
I didn't want to do.

01:13:08.305 --> 01:13:09.406
What?

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.276
But, uh...

01:13:12.309 --> 01:13:17.281
Lord,
for the first time in my life...

01:13:20.017 --> 01:13:22.319
I owned the shirt
that was on my back.

01:13:25.289 --> 01:13:28.159
Everything you got,

01:13:28.192 --> 01:13:30.361
everything you had...

01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:34.664
we took it
from somebody else.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.004
Stole.

01:13:40.037 --> 01:13:42.473
That property up there on in it,

01:13:42.506 --> 01:13:49.213
the ranch you grew up on, boy,
we stole all of it.

01:13:49.246 --> 01:13:52.783
We grew that ranch
to double in size.

01:13:52.816 --> 01:13:55.286
Yeah. Yeah. We did that.

01:13:55.319 --> 01:13:58.455
After we took it.

01:13:58.489 --> 01:14:01.025
And that ain't all we took.

01:14:01.058 --> 01:14:03.761
We took the cattle,
and we took the money

01:14:03.794 --> 01:14:06.430
from every little rancher
that was around you, as well.

01:14:06.463 --> 01:14:08.499
No.

01:14:08.532 --> 01:14:12.469
Duncan had no other choice.

01:14:12.503 --> 01:14:14.838
And truth be told,

01:14:14.872 --> 01:14:18.142
you would've been involved
in all this shit, as well.

01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:23.113
Our stories had already
been written.

01:14:30.554 --> 01:14:34.091
He never wanted you to walk
in his footsteps.

01:14:35.859 --> 01:14:39.163
And he never ever wanted you

01:14:39.196 --> 01:14:44.101
to carry the kind of hate
in your heart...

01:14:45.869 --> 01:14:48.038
that he carried in his.

01:15:36.453 --> 01:15:40.824
Jake!

01:15:40.858 --> 01:15:42.226
Jacob!

01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:56.206
Jake!

01:16:05.215 --> 01:16:06.517
You're not hurt?

01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:08.185
No.

01:16:08.218 --> 01:16:11.322
The women, they fixed me up.

01:16:14.591 --> 01:16:16.460
Hey, big brother.

01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:17.961
Hello, Jake.

01:16:20.631 --> 01:16:22.433
What's wrong?

01:16:24.635 --> 01:16:26.170
You're not Duncan.

01:16:26.203 --> 01:16:27.338
You're not my brother.

01:16:41.985 --> 01:16:43.420
Shit.

01:17:06.543 --> 01:17:07.544
Lester.

01:17:07.578 --> 01:17:08.979
No. Where are you going?

01:17:09.012 --> 01:17:10.514
Whoa, whoa.

01:17:10.547 --> 01:17:12.649
Okay.

01:17:14.952 --> 01:17:15.986
Okay, okay. I got you.
I got you.

01:17:16.019 --> 01:17:17.388
Alright.

01:17:17.421 --> 01:17:19.990
Wylie, Wylie, get your ass
over here.

01:17:21.692 --> 01:17:23.394
Alright.

01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:29.600
Just fight, okay?

01:17:38.308 --> 01:17:39.543
You're going to be
alright, Lester.

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:41.278
You're going to be fine.

01:18:17.614 --> 01:18:20.050
Please don't go.
You're all I have left.

01:18:20.083 --> 01:18:25.522
Come on, please.

01:18:25.556 --> 01:18:26.657
Please.

01:18:54.117 --> 01:18:55.352
Jacob.

01:19:13.437 --> 01:19:15.472
Wylie.

01:19:50.207 --> 01:19:52.777
We've walked through
the pale door,

01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:54.511
and hell was our reward.

01:19:54.545 --> 01:19:55.579
- Wylie.
- What?

01:19:55.612 --> 01:19:57.481
No. Stop, Wylie!

01:20:24.641 --> 01:20:26.476
Listen to me, kid.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.782
It's been dark out way too long.

01:20:33.885 --> 01:20:37.554
The sun ain't coming up.

01:20:37.588 --> 01:20:42.526
We barely have enough ammo
for one, let alone both.

01:20:42.559 --> 01:20:44.896
We are not safe here.

01:20:59.476 --> 01:21:01.712
I know.

01:21:07.885 --> 01:21:11.521
I don't know if it's
any consolation to you.

01:21:12.924 --> 01:21:15.827
You know, you ain't the only one
lost a brother.

01:21:17.929 --> 01:21:21.231
Maybe not by blood.

01:21:21.264 --> 01:21:22.867
Hell, I never had
no fucking family.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:24.902
I was raised in
a Goddamn brothel.

01:21:26.503 --> 01:21:29.606
And, uh...

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.844
Duncan was my brother, too.

01:21:38.248 --> 01:21:42.653
You... You may think
I don't give a shit.

01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:50.661
And I do.

01:21:50.694 --> 01:21:53.664
I had a role to play,
and I played it.

01:21:57.802 --> 01:22:03.674
But you don't think for a second
you're alone.

01:22:03.707 --> 01:22:06.576
Now,

01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:11.515
you and I,
we're going to walk out

01:22:11.548 --> 01:22:14.518
and either find our way
out of this labyrinth

01:22:14.551 --> 01:22:16.788
or go down swinging, okay?

01:23:06.037 --> 01:23:08.940
- I've only got one left.
- Me, too.

01:23:08.973 --> 01:23:10.307
Do not let them take you.

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:12.910
You understand?

01:23:12.944 --> 01:23:14.779
Save it for yourself.

01:23:37.034 --> 01:23:38.836
Whoa!

01:24:31.122 --> 01:24:32.924
She's crowning.

01:24:40.898 --> 01:24:42.666
Hey, kid.

01:24:44.168 --> 01:24:47.839
Stay there.
Don't turn all yellow on me now.

01:24:47.872 --> 01:24:48.906
- Alright?
- I... I guess.

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:50.908
Stay with me.

01:24:50.942 --> 01:24:52.810
You listen.
When we get out of this,

01:24:52.844 --> 01:24:54.879
I want you to promise me
something.

01:24:54.912 --> 01:24:56.379
Become a farmer.

01:24:56.413 --> 01:24:58.682
As an outlaw,
you're bad fucking luck.

01:25:04.989 --> 01:25:07.390
Let's go.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.029
We're walking that way.

01:25:23.107 --> 01:25:24.507
Go. Go.

01:25:24.541 --> 01:25:26.043
Don't turn back.

01:25:26.077 --> 01:25:27.744
I am done running.

01:25:27.778 --> 01:25:29.446
We had this date for a while.

01:25:29.479 --> 01:25:31.082
Come on.

01:25:33.017 --> 01:25:34.718
Come on, now.

01:25:34.752 --> 01:25:36.153
Let's go!

01:26:06.516 --> 01:26:09.519
I won't let you take me, too.

01:26:09.552 --> 01:26:10.855
We can offer you...

01:26:10.888 --> 01:26:14.792
What?

01:26:14.825 --> 01:26:18.528
Money?

01:26:18.561 --> 01:26:21.564
Women?

01:26:21.598 --> 01:26:23.500
Men?

01:26:23.533 --> 01:26:25.169
Your brother.

01:26:28.839 --> 01:26:30.241
He's alive?

01:26:30.274 --> 01:26:32.109
Yes.

01:26:35.813 --> 01:26:37.949
Bullshit.

01:26:37.982 --> 01:26:39.817
I don't believe you.

01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:41.886
- No!
- Why do you even care?

01:26:41.919 --> 01:26:44.055
If you do that, your innocence
will be gone.

01:26:44.088 --> 01:26:45.957
You'll have taken a life,
and with that,

01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:47.825
your blood will be tainted.

01:26:47.858 --> 01:26:50.861
You'll just be
another soiled soul.

01:26:54.832 --> 01:26:56.466
Then let me see my brother.

01:27:16.287 --> 01:27:18.122
Hey, big brother.

01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:28.032
Hey, big brother.

01:27:29.166 --> 01:27:30.835
What, you take me for a fool,
huh?

01:27:30.868 --> 01:27:33.004
- That's not my...
- Hey, little brother.

01:27:37.208 --> 01:27:41.212
Jake, Jake.

01:27:41.245 --> 01:27:44.148
Are you sure you're okay?

01:27:44.181 --> 01:27:45.916
Oh, my God.

01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:49.552
A little sore, but these ladies
gave me something.

01:27:49.586 --> 01:27:51.288
What's going on here, Jake?

01:27:51.322 --> 01:27:54.025
- I-I need you to do something.
- What is it, little brother?

01:27:54.058 --> 01:27:55.625
- It's not going to be easy.
- What is it little brother?

01:27:55.658 --> 01:27:58.029
- What is it?
- Forgive Father.

01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:01.664
Why do you say that?

01:28:01.698 --> 01:28:04.969
Buy back the farm. End the hate.

01:28:11.175 --> 01:28:12.575
Why?
Why are you saying that?

01:28:12.609 --> 01:28:14.245
He loved you, too.

01:28:16.347 --> 01:28:18.983
He loved you, too.

01:28:19.016 --> 01:28:22.920
You finally get
to make a choice.

01:28:22.953 --> 01:28:25.222
Do we have a deal?

01:28:30.693 --> 01:28:33.197
I want assurances he'll be safe,

01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:34.697
or I swear to God, I'll do it.

01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:35.632
Jake... What are you doing,
Jake?

01:28:35.665 --> 01:28:36.934
No. Stop.

01:28:36.967 --> 01:28:38.936
Let me do this one thing,
please.

01:28:38.969 --> 01:28:41.105
Let me be the one
who protects you for a change.

01:28:41.138 --> 01:28:42.306
I'm your older brother.

01:28:42.339 --> 01:28:45.943
I know,
and you've got to leave.

01:28:45.976 --> 01:28:48.345
You've got to leave.
Go back to that...

01:28:48.379 --> 01:28:50.281
that pretty lady of yours.

01:28:54.752 --> 01:28:57.321
Make a family.

01:28:57.354 --> 01:29:02.359
Have the life that you couldn't,
that Dad couldn't.

01:29:17.341 --> 01:29:19.043
Come on.

01:29:29.086 --> 01:29:30.687
You let him go.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:34.657
Our power ends
at the town's edge.

01:29:34.691 --> 01:29:36.994
We control who can leave.

01:29:39.296 --> 01:29:41.198
Can I watch him leave?

01:30:04.721 --> 01:30:06.357
I love you, little brother.

01:30:08.459 --> 01:30:10.261
I love you, big brother.

01:30:54.271 --> 01:30:56.106
Hey, girls.

01:30:58.108 --> 01:31:00.244
Come on, now.

01:31:00.277 --> 01:31:02.279
Let's have us a little supper.

01:31:05.549 --> 01:31:07.284
Come on.

01:31:07.318 --> 01:31:09.486
Hey, little one.

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.189
There you go.

01:31:18.195 --> 01:31:20.364
Are you coming in soon?

01:31:20.397 --> 01:31:23.834
I need to put little Jacob
to bed.

01:31:23.867 --> 01:31:25.869
Soon.
