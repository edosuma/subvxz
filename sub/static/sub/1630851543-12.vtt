20:26.290 --> 20:28.693
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.363
Before we begin, I just want to
take a moment to say

20:31.395 --> 20:35.433
that of all the experiences
in my career being on this show

20:35.467 --> 20:38.936
has truly been
by far the most stressful.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.739
[laughter]

20:40.771 --> 20:42.374
It's an honor.
Obviously, it's an honor.

20:42.406 --> 20:44.276
It's just that nobody
talks--nobody talks

20:44.308 --> 20:45.876
about what goes into this,

20:45.911 --> 20:47.913
you know, the sleepless nights,
the endless rehearsals,

20:47.945 --> 20:51.349
the rewrites, the run-throughs,
the rules you have to follow.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.050
'Cause the producers told me
I can do anything

20:53.085 --> 20:55.753
I want on this stage...
as long as it's funny,

20:55.787 --> 20:58.123
new, inventive, deceptive,
camera-friendly, risk-averse,

20:58.155 --> 21:00.692
low-maintenance, high-impact
on brand, offbeat, in style

21:00.726 --> 21:02.227
but out of the ordinary,
under six minutes,

21:02.260 --> 21:03.327
and you keep it clean.

21:03.362 --> 21:04.395
Other than that, go crazy,
and...

21:04.429 --> 21:06.999
[laughter]

21:07.031 --> 21:09.201
They were very clear
about that last rule.

21:09.233 --> 21:11.135
They told me,
"You can't swear on TV.

21:11.169 --> 21:12.637
"You have to keep it clean.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.006
"'Cause if you swear,
then we have to bleep you.

21:14.038 --> 21:15.173
And that's a giant pain
in the ass."

21:15.207 --> 21:16.575
[bleep]. [bleep].

21:16.607 --> 21:20.679
See, this--this is why
I brought my swear jar.

21:20.711 --> 21:21.980
[laughter]

21:22.013 --> 21:24.849
Because this is stressful.

21:24.883 --> 21:27.752
And I found myself
swearing so much in rehearsals,

21:27.786 --> 21:29.488
you know, that I was scared
I'd slip up in front of you,

21:29.520 --> 21:33.157
and I didn't want to do that,
so I kept a swear jar,

21:33.191 --> 21:35.027
a visual record of every curse

21:35.059 --> 21:36.595
and cuss
that came out of my mouth

21:36.627 --> 21:37.863
while figuring out
what the [bleep]

21:37.895 --> 21:39.664
I was gonna do here today.
Son of a [bleep].

21:39.698 --> 21:42.601
- Oh-ho-ho.
- The point is...

21:42.634 --> 21:46.038
the point is, every time
I swore this week

21:46.070 --> 21:47.572
I put money in that jar.

21:47.605 --> 21:49.775
The worse the word,
the bigger the bill.

21:49.807 --> 21:52.778
And then I realized something.
I realized I was worrying

21:52.810 --> 21:56.414
for nothing, because
this could be the trick.

21:56.448 --> 21:59.351
So, Penn, Teller, Alyson,
the game is simple.

21:59.384 --> 22:00.685
You are gonna read
my mind today

22:00.719 --> 22:02.887
by guessing how much money
is in that jar,

22:02.921 --> 22:05.790
or to put it a different way,

22:05.824 --> 22:08.794
how much swearing it takes
to be on "Fool Us."

22:08.826 --> 22:10.494
So, Teller, we're gonna
start with you

22:10.528 --> 22:13.065
since you are literally
the only one here now

22:13.097 --> 22:14.532
who has never
sworn on camera.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.167
[laughter]

22:16.201 --> 22:17.336
Would you give me
a guess, please?

22:17.368 --> 22:18.403
How much do you think
is in the jar

22:18.436 --> 22:22.973
if you had to take a swing?

22:23.008 --> 22:26.377
- He says $75.60.
- Oh.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.714
- Only 75 over the whole week?
Can we round it to a dollar?

22:29.748 --> 22:31.883
There's no coins in there;
should we say 75 or 76?

22:31.916 --> 22:34.752
It's your decision?
- 76, says Teller.

22:34.786 --> 22:37.422
- 76.

22:37.455 --> 22:39.191
Didn't realize
I looked like a Mormon.

22:39.223 --> 22:42.594
That's from Teller. Good.
Let's go to Alyson, please.

22:42.626 --> 22:44.195
Alyson, how much do you think
is in the jar

22:44.229 --> 22:46.597
if you had to take a guess?

22:46.631 --> 22:51.169
- Is it, like, a dollar
for a just medium word?

22:51.202 --> 22:53.605
- Yeah. So each word gets worse
as the bill gets higher,

22:53.637 --> 22:55.539
and I've been told I should
stop saying them, so...

22:55.574 --> 22:56.775
- Okay.

22:56.807 --> 22:57.776
- I don't know
that I can give examples.

22:57.808 --> 22:58.777
- All right, no problem.

22:58.809 --> 23:03.515
I will go for...
I'm gonna go $88.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.451
- $88.

23:06.484 --> 23:08.854
See, everybody goes higher
when I make that Mormon joke.

23:08.886 --> 23:11.390
And then finally, Penn,

23:11.423 --> 23:13.525
since I learned most of these
words from watching you,

23:13.557 --> 23:15.126
you will give us
the last guest, please,

23:15.160 --> 23:16.127
nice and loud.

23:16.161 --> 23:17.628
- 247.

23:17.662 --> 23:19.064
- Wow.

23:19.096 --> 23:21.199
- 247. I gotta tell you,
it's starting to feel

23:21.232 --> 23:22.634
like these
are more about your guys' week

23:22.666 --> 23:25.369
than they are mine,
but that's fine.

23:25.403 --> 23:28.373
So here's the good news.
Nobody got it right.

23:28.406 --> 23:30.008
Nobody got it exactly right.

23:30.040 --> 23:34.546
But shockingly, one of you was
very, very close.

23:34.578 --> 23:37.348
Believe it or not, Alyson,
you were the closest.

23:37.382 --> 23:38.817
- Yes.

23:38.849 --> 23:40.018
- Not your number, but, like,
physically you were

23:40.050 --> 23:41.185
the closest to the jar,
and I only get

23:41.219 --> 23:42.319
three more minutes.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.587
Would you join me onstage,
please?

23:43.622 --> 23:45.190
Give her
a round of applause.

23:45.222 --> 23:47.826
And, Penn,
you are going to hold on

23:47.858 --> 23:49.994
to the list if you would.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.096
- I will.
- Thank you so, so much, Penn.

23:52.130 --> 23:53.498
- Thank you.

23:53.531 --> 23:57.602
- Now, Alyson, before
we started any of this...

23:57.635 --> 23:59.538
- Yes.

23:59.570 --> 24:01.306
- I made a prediction...
- Oh.

24:01.338 --> 24:04.276
- A prediction about how
I thought this game would go,

24:04.308 --> 24:05.509
and I left it right there

24:05.544 --> 24:07.378
at the top of the jar
right about there.

24:07.412 --> 24:10.816
Now, even though that
prediction didn't come true--

24:10.848 --> 24:12.717
well, not exactly--I think

24:12.750 --> 24:14.051
you're still gonna find it
interesting.

24:14.085 --> 24:15.720
Alyson,
I don't want to touch it,

24:15.753 --> 24:18.222
but would you please take that
piece of paper out of the jar

24:18.256 --> 24:20.325
and nice and loud
read it to everyone here?

24:20.357 --> 24:22.527
'Cause I think
it still worked out.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.497
- "Nobody will be even close."

24:25.529 --> 24:27.398
- Technically nailed it,

24:27.432 --> 24:30.301
but there's more;
please read the rest.

24:30.335 --> 24:32.403
- Open it?
- Yeah.

24:32.436 --> 24:37.209
- "But together everyone
will get it right."

24:37.241 --> 24:41.512
- And I know that sounds
like a bad fortune cookie,

24:41.546 --> 24:44.415
but that's why
I gave you the list, Penn.

24:44.449 --> 24:45.650
Could you open the calculator
on your phone

24:45.683 --> 24:47.318
and start adding
the guesses up?

24:47.352 --> 24:48.720
- Okay. Sure.

24:48.752 --> 24:50.721
- Alyson, I did something else
backstage as well.

24:50.755 --> 24:55.660
I counted up the jar,
every single bill in there.

24:55.693 --> 24:58.762
And I wrote the total
on a little sticker

24:58.797 --> 25:00.365
inside the lid.
Can you see that?

25:00.397 --> 25:01.465
- Yes.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.167
- Would you hold
onto that please?

25:03.201 --> 25:04.635
Because the thing
I realized is,

25:04.669 --> 25:05.936
predicting one of your numbers,

25:05.971 --> 25:07.838
that would've been easy,

25:07.873 --> 25:11.542
but predicting the total
of all your numbers, Penn,

25:11.576 --> 25:13.644
nice and loud tell us
what did they all add up to?

25:13.678 --> 25:15.145
- Well, I'll give you the
information,

25:15.180 --> 25:17.147
It's 411.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.983
Alyson, show them
how much was in the jar.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.319
That was the real pain
in the...butt.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.055
And that is what it takes
to be on "Fool Us."

25:24.088 --> 25:25.789
Thank you very, very much.

25:25.824 --> 25:28.292
- Jason Suran.

25:28.326 --> 25:31.529
[cheers and applause]

25:31.563 --> 25:33.064
Is there anything else
that makes you cuss

25:33.097 --> 25:34.732
as much as magic?

25:34.766 --> 25:36.902
- Not even close.

25:36.934 --> 25:40.005
- Do you use mentalism
in your everyday life?

25:40.038 --> 25:42.907
- I do, but not in the way
I think people think.

25:42.941 --> 25:44.308
I think people think
that you walk around

25:44.342 --> 25:46.076
like a human lie detector
or something like that.

25:46.111 --> 25:49.346
And for me it's more about
this thing that kind of

25:49.381 --> 25:51.215
makes people light up.
Because everybody

25:51.249 --> 25:52.884
likes getting to share things
about themselves.

25:52.917 --> 25:55.052
And we all want to feel
connected to other people.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.654
And I think mentalism
opens doors,

25:56.688 --> 25:59.023
and it creates opportunities
for connection.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.326
- Oh. All right.
Have you always loved magic?

26:02.359 --> 26:05.462
- I didn't even begin
considering, you know,

26:05.497 --> 26:07.499
magic until I was in college

26:07.531 --> 26:10.000
and just kind of was desperate
for an artistic outlet

26:10.035 --> 26:12.369
that I wasn't being graded
on every single day.

26:12.403 --> 26:14.538
And then there was
this puzzle aspect to it.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.875
There was this
tactile aspect to it.

26:16.907 --> 26:19.844
And for somebody like me having
something that I could kind of

26:19.877 --> 26:23.114
always be sort of practicing
in the back of my head

26:23.147 --> 26:25.717
was really, really cathartic.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.519
- All right. Should we find out

26:27.551 --> 26:30.154
if your mental magic
earned you a trophy?

26:30.188 --> 26:33.791
- Let's do it.
- All right, boys.

26:33.825 --> 26:36.461
- What a god[bleep]
great routine.

26:36.493 --> 26:37.662
- Thank you.
- Money.

26:37.695 --> 26:39.897
- It's really--
it's really good.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.499
It's really a nice way
to present.

26:41.532 --> 26:43.567
You know, the problem
with mentalism

26:43.602 --> 26:46.403
is that the number stuff
just isn't interesting.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.740
And you made the number stuff
represent something

26:48.772 --> 26:50.808
that made it really,
really interesting.

26:50.842 --> 26:52.676
And you also played
to something I care about.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.578
I mean, even though
we do a show

26:54.613 --> 26:56.647
that a lot of families watch,

26:56.681 --> 26:59.384
they still seem to realize
that I have been known

26:59.416 --> 27:02.854
to use obscenity
and profanity and often.

27:02.886 --> 27:08.259
As a matter of fact, there was
a big competition a while ago

27:08.292 --> 27:11.930
for what magicians
swore the most.

27:11.962 --> 27:14.598
And Al Koran
you probably know...

27:14.633 --> 27:17.602
- Of course.
- Was someone who swore a lot.

27:17.635 --> 27:20.438
And we had a competition
where someone listened to us

27:20.471 --> 27:23.674
both for a long time,
and it was really amazing,

27:23.708 --> 27:26.377
because at the end
of the whole thing,

27:26.411 --> 27:31.548
I won the Al Koran medallion.
I did.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.952
I won that, because I actually
swore more than he did.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.021
And I tell you
it's a great premise

27:37.055 --> 27:39.023
and a great, great idea.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.159
And I think we know
how you did it,

27:41.192 --> 27:45.697
and if we're wrong
we're [bleep].

27:45.730 --> 27:46.964
[laughter]

27:46.998 --> 27:49.200
- So do they know
how you did your trick?

27:49.233 --> 27:51.536
- Abso-[bleep]-lutely.

27:51.568 --> 27:54.072
Thank you very, very much

compact cabinet and assistant.

30:58.155 --> 31:01.159
Simply place the assistant
in the cabinet.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.294
Make sure your audience
can see your assistant

31:03.327 --> 31:07.865

through the cabinet.

31:07.898 --> 31:13.904
Now insert the blade.

to be able to move freely,

31:28.886 --> 31:32.022
even wiggle her toes.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.424
Of course, your assistant
emerges from the cabinet

31:34.459 --> 31:37.729
completely intact
and unharmed.

31:37.761 --> 31:41.598
Everything can be
completely examined.

Lesson two, the crystal
casket of mystery.

32:05.155 --> 32:08.526

crystal clear sealable casket

32:08.558 --> 32:12.864

and assistant.

32:12.896 --> 32:16.366

descends from above.

in a seductive dance, smokin'.

Then the assistant
leaves the stage,

32:27.711 --> 32:31.648

enters the casket.

32:31.682 --> 32:34.352

the magician inside

32:34.384 --> 32:37.922

is sealed shut.

you perform

34:00.337 --> 34:02.140
for Penn and Teller, right?

34:02.173 --> 34:03.941

everyone know that

34:03.974 --> 34:05.609
after the funny introduction

34:05.643 --> 34:08.813
there were absolutely no

34:08.846 --> 34:10.313
- Yeah. That's right.

34:10.347 --> 34:12.315
- So you call it
device-driven magic.

34:12.349 --> 34:13.684
What is that?

34:13.717 --> 34:15.719
- Well, gadgets and gizmos,
I suppose.

34:15.753 --> 34:17.487
That's the kind of thing
I like.

34:17.521 --> 34:18.822

are pretty tough.

in front of Penn and Teller?

34:27.597 --> 34:29.967
- Yeah, kind of.
Well, you know,

34:30.001 --> 34:33.070
Scottish audiences have this
reputation for being tough,

34:33.103 --> 34:35.505
but I think you just
have to win them over,

34:35.539 --> 34:37.675
and then they kind of love
you forever.

34:42.947 --> 34:46.650
if your Scottish magic
fooled Penn and Teller.

- Hey, Roddy, you've done
a wicked big miracle here,

34:50.288 --> 34:52.389

And you did that whole
first hunk just being funny,

35:00.164 --> 35:03.000

You were very meticulous

35:03.034 --> 35:05.436

that the magic was all done

35:05.469 --> 35:08.505
not using any camera stuff,

that Teller and I love doing.

want to bring out props

35:19.182 --> 35:20.518

you've never seen before.

look like things we all know

and are really simple.

35:33.898 --> 35:38.034

any of it,
