00:00.876 --> 00:02.670
Previously on 90210:

00:02.795 --> 00:05.297
HARRY:
Come on, Beverly Hills is going
to be great for our family.

00:05.422 --> 00:07.800
We got the weather, we got
the palm trees with the...

00:07.925 --> 00:09.593
more palm trees.
More palm trees.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.094
I had, like, a million friends.

00:11.219 --> 00:14.181
Back home.
And they all knew, you know?

00:14.306 --> 00:15.432
About the whole adoption story.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.559
Ethan, this is Annie, the
new principal's daughter.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.311
Annie, my
boyfriend, Ethan.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.313
Yeah, well, actually,
yeah, we-we know each other.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.731
Yeah, we...
We met, like, two summers ago?

00:22.857 --> 00:24.274
Okay, I'm not
talking to you

00:24.399 --> 00:25.442
as a guidance counselor
right now.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.444
I am talking to you
as your sister.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.696
Come on, you've got
to let go of that anger.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.823
It's not doing you any good.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.448
You don't want
to end up like Mom.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.702
Everyone's seen it, Ethan!
Everyone knows!

00:34.827 --> 00:37.120
ETHAN:
Naomi, I hurt you, you hurt me.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.747
Is that how it works with us?

00:38.873 --> 00:40.582
Are you breaking up with me?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.376
I'm breaking up with us.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.419
Hey, Ty.
Want to grab dinner
tonight after rehearsal?

00:44.545 --> 00:45.629
This night

00:45.754 --> 00:48.131
is nothing like I
thought it would be.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.424
ANNIE:
I like him.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.634
At the very least

00:50.759 --> 00:52.260
we'll be friends.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.429
Are we friends?

01:06.984 --> 01:08.610
Thanks, hon.
DIXON:
Ooh, pancakes!

01:08.736 --> 01:09.695
ANNIE:
Throw me one.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.696
We do not
throw food.

01:10.821 --> 01:11.822
Deb, banana.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.198
Thank you.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.616
I would like everybody to sit.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.159
Can't. Got to meet Silver
before school.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.452
We have an English project
to finish.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.537
Oh, the one about
modern poetry?

01:18.662 --> 01:20.247
No. I handed that in
a couple weeks ago.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.207
I got to be at work early.
I can drop you off.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.625
No, thanks, Dad.
Navid's picking us up.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.335
I've got rehearsal
until 8:00.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.962
Oh, I can pick you up tonight.
No, Silver's gonna

01:27.086 --> 01:28.255
give me a ride;
I won't be home for dinner.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.215
DIXON:
Me, too. Peace.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.425
Me, three.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.510
I've got a late meeting
with the teachers' union.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.721
Always a joy.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.693
Hey.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.283
So what, you're...
ignoring me now?

01:56.408 --> 01:58.243
(chuckles):
No, not at all.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.661
How can I help you?

01:59.787 --> 02:01.204
(chuckles softly)

02:01.329 --> 02:04.207
I just... you know, wanted to...

02:04.332 --> 02:06.209
see how you were doing.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.211
Oh. I'm doing great.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.797
Thanks for asking.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.381
Is there gonna be anything else?

02:11.506 --> 02:12.967
Because I really have
to get to class,

02:13.092 --> 02:14.635
and I have to make plans
for tomorrow

02:14.760 --> 02:16.344
because my dad's
taking me to Vegas.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.806
So you're doing
that again?
Yeah. Of course.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.724
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.726
Anyway, Coldplay's performing.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.561
My dad's company's
going all out.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.313
Sounds like fun.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.982
It's gonna be awesome.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.830
If I don't see you,
I don't know you're late.

02:42.955 --> 02:46.333
If I don't know you're
late, I don't have to
give you a late slip.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.167
You're looking a little
run-down, kiddo.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.420
Yeah, well, run-down
is totally in right now.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.589
It's chic to look post-rehab,
didn't you know?

02:52.714 --> 02:53.882
No, I didn't know.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.926
But I thought brushing
your hair was cool.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.636
But then, again,
I guess I'm old.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.346
Yeah. Yeah, you are
getting up there.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.555
Mm-hmm.
Got to go.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.518
Get to class, Silver.
You're late again.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.228
I trust you gave her
a late slip.
Hell, no.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.605
She's my sister.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.024
Really? Nepotism?

03:10.149 --> 03:12.026
Yeah, you got
a problem with that?

03:12.151 --> 03:13.443
Yeah, actually...
maybe we should discuss it

03:13.568 --> 03:14.444
tomorrow night over dinner.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.571
Okay.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.616
Hey, guys, I
wanted to ask you

03:19.741 --> 03:21.076
a little something:
my dad's screening

03:21.200 --> 03:23.120
the new Bond movie
tomorrow night at my place.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.330
I wish he'd screen
one of his other movies.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.247
(laughter)

03:26.373 --> 03:28.167
No, seriously, it's not out yet.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.293
He knows a guy that did a little
something something on the film.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.753
So I was wondering,
do you guys

03:31.879 --> 03:32.921
want to see a movie?

03:33.047 --> 03:33.922
Is your mom gonna be there?

03:34.048 --> 03:35.256
(laughter)

03:35.382 --> 03:37.509
NAVID:
Yeah, she is
gonna be there.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.344
Yo, E, you in?

03:39.469 --> 03:40.261
Yeah. Why not?

03:40.387 --> 03:41.805
I got nothing better to do.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.891
I'm free, single...

03:44.016 --> 03:44.933
(coughing):
Miserable.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.769
And, uh, horny.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.647
Well, I mean, as long
as your mom's gonna be there.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.773
(chattering)

03:52.983 --> 03:54.735
Hey.
(laughs):
Hi.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.653
So, are your parents
still pissed

03:56.778 --> 03:59.781
I took you on a plane?
They'll get over it.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.408
So, want to go out
tomorrow night?

04:01.533 --> 04:03.243
Tomorrow night?
Uh, there's a new band

04:03.368 --> 04:05.204
playing at the pier;
it's gonna be pretty sick,

04:05.328 --> 04:07.664
if you want to go.
Yeah, I would love to.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.583
Great. Um, 8:00?

04:09.708 --> 04:10.625
(laughs):
Great.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.753
All right.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.046
Yes!

04:15.672 --> 04:18.007
If you get my mother
to the chiropractor on Saturday,

04:18.132 --> 04:19.843
I told the board
that I could meet.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.554
Harry, I can't help but feel
that since we moved here

04:22.679 --> 04:25.099
none of us has time
for each other anymore.
What? No.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.934
Sweetheart, just,
we're finding our way.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.643
You know,
new city, new jobs.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.479
I know, I know, but I really
miss doing things together,

04:31.605 --> 04:33.273
all of us.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.985
(chuckles):
And I know exactly
what we need to do.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.403
Family night?

04:38.528 --> 04:39.905
You-you want us
to go bowling?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.406
Yeah.
Your dad and I

04:41.531 --> 04:43.617
would like to spend
some time with you guys.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.453
I feel like we don't see
each other anymore.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.495
A-And...

04:47.621 --> 04:49.330
and we really,

04:49.456 --> 04:51.083
really want to hang out
with you guys.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.751
Especially on a Friday night.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.045
But, uh...

04:55.170 --> 04:56.797
I have a date with Ty
tomorrow night.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.633
And Navid's dad is showing
the new Bond movie. Come on.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.803
Well, your dad and I have
tickets to the Hollywood Bowl,

05:02.928 --> 05:04.554
but we're not going.
No, we're not.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.473
Because we want
to spend time with you guys.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.475
Come on, please.
Oh, come on, guys.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.185
Please? Like...

05:10.310 --> 05:12.395
Dad, nobody does
family night here.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.521
(Annie laughs)
You know?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.816
Well, then we are
just gonna have to bring

05:15.941 --> 05:17.609
a little Kansas
to Beverly Hills

05:17.734 --> 05:19.611
because we are having
family night tomorrow night,

05:19.736 --> 05:21.446
and we are gonna have fun.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.365
Because it's
all about family.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.992
Can I stay
again tonight?

06:07.117 --> 06:08.743
Just one more night, I promise.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.829
I'm sorry, Silver.
We're full.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.206
I need the space for people

06:12.331 --> 06:14.208
who really don't have
any place to go.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.917
Look, you don't know
what it's like there.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.419
I know, baby,
but you got to work it out.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.048
I'm sorry.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.015
I hear there's this new band
playing tonight at the pier.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.641
I'm going to Vegas.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.144
You're doing
that again?
Yes. My dad's firm

06:34.269 --> 06:36.063
throws this celebrity
golf tournament every year.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.523
Huge party--
oh, my God, it's so much fun.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.734
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.944
I mean, he's only four,
and he's already reading
all these words.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.821
And I'm sure this is
really boring to you, right?

06:44.946 --> 06:46.198
Oh, no, no, no,
it's, you know,

06:46.323 --> 06:47.908
it's your son;
it's fascinating.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.159
I love kids, you know?

06:49.284 --> 06:51.870
I teach kids, I... flunk kids,

06:51.995 --> 06:55.123
I want to strangle 'em
sometimes, but that's...

06:55.249 --> 06:59.169
I'm curious, Ryan. How many
of your friends have kids?

06:59.294 --> 07:01.671
Yeah, let me think,
about none...

07:01.796 --> 07:03.090
Hmm.
actually.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.383
But, you know,
I'm really close

07:04.507 --> 07:07.219
with the kids I work with
at juvie, so does that count?

07:07.344 --> 07:09.054
You work with kids
at juvenile hall?

07:09.179 --> 07:12.599
Yeah, yeah, just on weekends
and, uh, Mondays after school,

07:12.724 --> 07:14.059
Tuesdays...

07:14.184 --> 07:15.852
Wednesdays, Thursdays...

07:15.977 --> 07:18.063
Just, I-I don't get out
a lot. It's sad.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.940
What do you do with them?

07:20.065 --> 07:21.816
Oh, you know, uh,
talk, play Scrabble.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.652
I know a lot more words
than them, so I usually win.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.363
Makes me feel good
about myself.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.989
It's a long story.
I'm just gonna...

07:28.115 --> 07:29.199
Uh, tonight? Dinner?

07:29.324 --> 07:31.034
Yeah.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.786
Hello. Hey, Mr. Matthews.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.662
Yeah. How you doing?

07:34.788 --> 07:35.872
Hey.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.999
I think he has
a crush on you.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.751
Oh, God, no.
No, no, no, no.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.169
We're colleagues.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.045
I would never go out...
Good.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.755
This school's hard
enough as it is

07:43.880 --> 07:45.173
without my sister
banging the teacher.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.050
(sarcastic chuckle):
Right.

07:47.175 --> 07:50.178
Um, so, I was wondering

07:50.304 --> 07:52.347
if maybe I could spend
the night tonight.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.891
We could, you know, we could
hang out, get some pizza.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.768
Invite Brenda.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.687
You know, I, uh, can't do it
tonight, sweetie.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.898
Um, but tomorrow night
for sure.
Yeah. Sure.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.483
Sure.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.778
Sure.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.032
Hey.
Hey.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.660
So, uh, any big plans tonight?

08:13.785 --> 08:15.662
Oh, yeah. Big date.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.622
Oh, y-you and Ty...
(laughs):
No.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.583
Me and my family-- we
are doing family night.

08:20.708 --> 08:21.835
Family night?
Mm-hmm.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.836
Huh.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.421
Yeah. Uh...

08:24.545 --> 08:26.923
they feel like they
never see us, so...

08:27.048 --> 08:28.758
Well, you know, it's probably
not total social suicide,

08:28.883 --> 08:30.302
as long as you go someplace

08:30.427 --> 08:32.261
where no one
from this school will see you.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.139
Uh, Lucky Strike
Bowling Alley?

08:34.264 --> 08:36.015
Oh, yeah,

08:36.140 --> 08:38.143
maybe someone from the chess
club might still talk to you.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.769
Terrific!

08:39.894 --> 08:41.855
Hey, Annie.
Ethan, what's up, man?

08:41.980 --> 08:43.063
Hey, man.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.565
So, I got your text.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.942
Sorry you can't make it.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.195
Yeah.
Uh...

08:48.320 --> 08:51.281
I got to go, so I'll, um,
catch you guys later.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.241
Bye.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.702
So you're blowing me off
tonight for bowling?

08:55.827 --> 08:58.163
Oh, God, my parents
are making me.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.580
That sucks.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.707
Yeah.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.126
I really wanted you
to see the pier.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.754
Well, uh, we could...

09:06.880 --> 09:08.006
What?

09:08.131 --> 09:09.007
What?
Nothing.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.009
What?

09:11.134 --> 09:13.761
I mean, instead of
picking me up at home,

09:13.887 --> 09:17.140
if you just happened to,
on your way to the pier,

09:17.265 --> 09:19.726
you know, maybe drop by

09:19.851 --> 09:21.102
the Lucky Strike lanes,

09:21.228 --> 09:23.438
and maybe I could
get out early?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.024
I mean, how long
could they bowl?

09:26.149 --> 09:28.943
So I'll accidentally
see you at 8:00.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.945
Okay. Great.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.655
All right.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.411
Dude, it's simple,
just tell your parents

09:37.536 --> 09:40.539
that you don't want to go.
Look, I'm not trying to
hurt their feelings, man.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.290
Just-just come to
the bowling alley,

09:42.416 --> 09:44.084
tell them the thing
about the movie.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.086
There's no way
they won't let me go.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.380
You sure it'll work?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.340
You know what?
Bring a lot of people.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.217
It'll be harder
for them to say no.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.220
Peer pressure.
Got it.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.764
Uh, it's the
weekend, miss.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.974
You can go.
Go home, go home.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.393
You're still here.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.353
(laughs):
I-I stayed for
a math lab.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.313
You have an "A"
in that class.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.023
I have an "A-."

10:07.148 --> 10:08.316
Ooh.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.943
I have an "A."

10:10.068 --> 10:11.111
(laughs)

10:11.236 --> 10:12.653
Geek.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.322
(laughs)

10:14.448 --> 10:15.656
So, what you doing tonight?

10:15.782 --> 10:16.657
You asking me out?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.243
I can't.

10:18.368 --> 10:22.956
Um, you know, because we're
doing this thing, family night.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.165
Bowling.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.001
That sounds very PG.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.963
Yeah, you know, we used to do it
all the time in Wichita,

10:30.088 --> 10:31.172
you know, every Friday night.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.258
We're weird, I know.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.344
Actually, I think
it sounds kind of nice.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.805
You want to come?

10:40.848 --> 10:42.683
W-We'll be at Lucky Strike.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.978
Maybe.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.230
All right.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.319
Hey, why are
you still here?

10:52.444 --> 10:53.903
I'm waiting for my dad.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.196
We're going straight
to the airport.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.324
Oh, I am so jealous!

10:57.449 --> 10:59.242
(laughs):
Of course you are.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.244
Well, have the
best time ever

11:01.369 --> 11:03.037
and call me
right when you get back.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.372
Bye.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.082
Oh! Hey!

11:06.207 --> 11:08.335
Hey, Mr. Clark.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.420
(laughs):
You got a new car!

11:10.545 --> 11:12.255
Princess.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.508
I'm so psyched.
The first thing I want
to do when we get there...

11:14.633 --> 11:15.634
Wait, which car
are we taking?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.218
CHARLES:
Uh, you know
what, sweetie?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.262
I am so sorry, but my merge
is in jeopardy.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.555
The whole deal's
about to go south,

11:20.679 --> 11:22.974
so I'm not gonna be able
to take you, not tonight.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.226
I'm gonna be stuck in the office
trying to fix this mess.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.520
But, Dad, we always...

11:26.645 --> 11:28.480
Listen, Naomi, I know
how much this meant to you,

11:28.605 --> 11:30.982
so I got you a little
consolation present
to make it up to you,

11:31.107 --> 11:32.359
just like the one
I just bought for your mom.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.860
I love it.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.945
Although, Charles,
I do think you spoil her.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.031
Listen, don't do anything
till I get to the office.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.324
You want to drive, drop me?

11:39.449 --> 11:42.285
You are gonna look
so great next to that car.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.662
Listen, I'm gonna
be in the office

11:43.786 --> 11:45.121
in ten minutes.
Could you just tell Pete...

11:47.332 --> 11:49.376
(engine starts)

12:05.058 --> 12:07.852
That is a skimpy little skirt
there for bowling.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.770
You got a hot date
I don't know about?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.189
Can't I just look good
for Mom and Dad?

12:11.314 --> 12:12.190
Annie! Dixon!

12:12.315 --> 12:14.025
Hey!

12:14.150 --> 12:16.027
Uh, you look hot.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.070
Thank you.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.112
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.113
Silver.
Hey, Silver.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.156
Hey, where were you today?

12:20.281 --> 12:21.282
I was looking for you
at school.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.825
Fell asleep
behind the biology lab.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.160
I saw Dixon, he said
you were coming, so...

12:24.285 --> 12:25.704
Um, um, um...!

12:25.828 --> 12:28.415
Mr. Jackson gave us so much
homework this weekend.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.917
You guys are cool
if Silver hangs with us?

12:31.042 --> 12:32.960
Yeah.
Cool.
Absolutely.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.295
You invited Silver?
What can we do?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.130
And Navid.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.508
It's family night.
Mom and Dad are
gonna be pissed.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.010
Which is great because
I invited Ty along, too.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.803
Oh...

12:42.929 --> 12:44.931
It just happened.
Yeah, sure.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.141
So, uh, Ms. Silver,
do you know how to bowl

12:47.267 --> 12:49.310
or, you know, are you too cool
for that kind of thing?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.937
I'm gonna kick your ass.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.147
(laughs):
All right, so first
to break 100...

12:53.273 --> 12:54.982
Buys fries?
You're on.

12:55.108 --> 12:55.858
Don't do that.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.037
Here you go.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.997
And, again,
I'm sorry I was late.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.374
Traffic was a nightmare.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.500
You know, this guy
wouldn't move.

13:12.626 --> 13:13.752
I think I hit
a squirrel.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.420
(chuckles)
Did you get
stuck in that?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.964
No, I live just down the street.
I walked here.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.173
Oh, that's right.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.175
Oh, we could've just
met at your house.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.928
I mean, I'd love to
check out your place.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.013
You know, I could meet
your son and... and...

13:26.139 --> 13:28.308
You're not ready for me
to meet your son.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.184
That's why you wanted
to meet here.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.979
No, no, it's not that.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.440
Okay, actually, it kind of is.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.358
But, uh, seriously, though,

13:37.484 --> 13:41.070
doesn't it freak you out
that I have a child?

13:41.195 --> 13:43.948
Doesn't it freak you out
at all that I am a child?

13:44.073 --> 13:46.033
A little.
No, it's... look...

13:46.159 --> 13:47.868
Look, I get it, you know,
whenever you're ready,

13:47.994 --> 13:49.412
I'd love to meet him.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.081
Uh, the truth is

13:52.206 --> 13:54.959
Sammy's only met the one guy
that I've dated seriously

13:55.084 --> 13:56.419
since he was born.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.337
And that would be...?

13:57.462 --> 13:59.213
I'm just curious.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.839
His father.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.261
We had a lot of history
in high school.

14:05.386 --> 14:09.056
Didn't see each other
for a while, and then, uh...

14:09.182 --> 14:13.269
hooked up one night
four years ago, and...

14:13.394 --> 14:16.481
Sammy's dad ever see him?

14:16.606 --> 14:18.399
He did, in the beginning.

14:18.525 --> 14:22.236
Then we had some issues.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.198
Now he says he wants to
get back into Sammy's life.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.408
And yours?

14:27.534 --> 14:30.203
Matthews for two?

14:30.328 --> 14:31.204
That's us.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.455
Great.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.337
That's perfect.

14:39.462 --> 14:42.298
Arm comes up straight.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.925
My own dad is blocking me.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.302
(laughs)

14:46.427 --> 14:48.346
Come on, Silver.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.556
Oh!

14:49.681 --> 14:51.641
That one is a strike.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.100
(screams)

14:53.226 --> 14:54.268
Oh, you got robbed!

14:54.394 --> 14:56.187
Good job.
You got robbed.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.480
Good job.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.233
Please tell me that
this was a good idea

15:00.358 --> 15:02.443
because I think Silver is
the only one enjoying herself.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.779
This was a good idea.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.992
That's just wrong.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.036
Um, I'm going to get a soda.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.329
Yeah, me, too.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.455
I'm going to get us
some fries.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.708
Good going, Silver.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.294
Yeah!

15:20.420 --> 15:23.214
Oh, nice!
Okay, it'll get there.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.257
It's gonna get there.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.218
You're getting
the hang of it.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.553
Silver, I'm really glad
you're here

15:28.678 --> 15:30.263
because I think if you weren't,

15:30.388 --> 15:32.473
Dixon and Annie would be
even more miserable.

15:32.599 --> 15:37.270
I guess people around here
don't really do family night.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.521
Ah... no.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.858
Not at all,
actually, ever.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.277
But, um, I think it's great
what you're doing.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.196
Don't get me wrong...

15:47.321 --> 15:49.574
I love this.

15:49.699 --> 15:53.912
I wish my mom, you know,
would come...

15:54.036 --> 15:56.163
I'm... I guess
I'm a little envious.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.123
Hey, Silver.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.087
Silver, Navid's here.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.213
Everybody's coming.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.548
Ty come?

16:05.673 --> 16:06.966
No.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.552
All right, sweetie.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.179
Okay.
You need a strike.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.264
Come on.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.141
Show them how
the old folks do it.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.726
(ball thuds)
Oh...!

16:16.851 --> 16:19.061
See, we don't need them.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.146
Oh! Oh! Okay!

16:20.271 --> 16:21.397
Next time, next time.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.774
It was close.
These are what I needed,
French fries.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.609
I've seen better.
(giggling)

16:24.734 --> 16:26.402
What up, y'all?

16:26.527 --> 16:27.236
Hey. Okay, we're all here.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.404
Talk to your parents
and let's go.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.739
Uh... wait.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.324
You know, we can't just leave.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.075
My parents will know
something's up.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.202
All right, well,
I mean, I'm always up

16:35.328 --> 16:36.621
for some bowling.
That is, of course,

16:36.746 --> 16:38.247
if Annie's not too scared
of getting beat.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.374
Oh...

16:40.500 --> 16:42.460
By you? Let's do it.
You're on.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.420
Excuse me, sir.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.172
Sorry.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.757
Chicks versus dudes.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.092
You do not have
your own bowling ball.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.678
What?

16:53.429 --> 16:56.098
What?
It was for my bar mitzvah.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.356
Go, Silver.
Go, Silver.

17:03.481 --> 17:04.732
(yelling)

17:08.611 --> 17:10.905
Really good try.
I think I dropped it!

17:15.785 --> 17:17.203
(cheering)
Strike!

17:32.886 --> 17:34.136
All right, Annie!

17:39.392 --> 17:41.853
(squealing loudly)

17:41.978 --> 17:44.772
That's what
I'm talking about!

17:44.898 --> 17:47.316
And that means we
just crushed you guys.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.359
What?

17:48.484 --> 17:50.403
Hey, yo.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.364
That was impressive.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.408
Um, do you want to, uh,

17:55.533 --> 17:57.577
I don't know, get
some air or something?

17:57.702 --> 17:59.453
Uh, yeah.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.621
Yeah, sure.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.540
Awesome.
Cool.

18:02.665 --> 18:03.416
Cool, yeah. Okay.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.167
Uh... yes.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.682
♪ Head under water ♪

18:19.807 --> 18:21.893

18:22.018 --> 18:25.271

18:25.396 --> 18:27.607

Baby, you sound pitchy.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.358
You sound bitchy.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.443
What's up?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.528
You can't be bumming
about your dad.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.321
This is one hell of a present
for bailing on...

18:34.447 --> 18:35.865
Okay, he didn't bail.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.784
He has to work tonight.
Ooh.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.326
It's Morgan.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.870
She says a lot of people
are going to Lucky Strike.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.455
Do you want to go?
Yeah, whatever.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.373
We need to stop
by my dad's office first.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.458
What?

18:45.583 --> 18:46.542
Well, I want to take him
something to eat.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.586
You know,
take care of him.
Okay.

18:48.711 --> 18:51.380
I want to tell him, you know,
I love the car.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.507
I do, too.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.427
I'm feeling Nobu.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.845
Ooh, yeah.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.013
That's a good choice.

19:05.853 --> 19:09.398
Yep, I'll bet your parents
never make you do family night.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.943
No, not my family.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.861
Um, my parents
are divorced.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.030
They weren't
when I met you.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.491
Yeah, it just happened
last year.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.452
God, I know so many people
whose parents are divorced,

19:21.577 --> 19:23.788
but I think I would just freak
if mine ever did.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.790
Yeah. I did.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.501
My dad's, like,
"No, it's great.

19:28.626 --> 19:31.462
Now you're gonna have two
bedrooms, two birthday parties."

19:31.587 --> 19:33.464
But now it's just, like,
a competition between them

19:33.589 --> 19:35.049
over who can throw
the bigger one.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.302
Okay, I bet
that doesn't totally suck.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.513
Well, you know...

19:40.638 --> 19:42.473
it actually kind of does.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.978
Anyway...

19:47.103 --> 19:49.063
I'm gonna save most of
that emotional goodness

19:49.188 --> 19:50.481
for my audition
for The Hills.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.566
So I don't want to bore you
with that, but...

19:52.692 --> 19:55.862
you know, I do think that
I could be the next Spencer.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.738
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.448
You wish, my friend.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.241
Yeah, yeah,
I really do wish.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.785
Actually...
Uh-huh.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.203
You don't believe me?
I don't know.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.039
I really don't know.
I can Spence anybody.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.414
I can out-Spence anybody.
You can Spence anybody.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.415
Right.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.416
Annie.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.751
Ty!

20:10.877 --> 20:12.378
Hey.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.589
Um...
You should go.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.466
You have a date, right?

20:17.591 --> 20:19.719
Right, um...

20:19.844 --> 20:21.428
I'll see you inside.

20:22.805 --> 20:23.806
You ready?

20:33.066 --> 20:35.902
Okay, I will be just a minute.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.320
I'm gonna bring this food
into Dad's office and...

20:43.826 --> 20:46.245
That's not your mom.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.725
I can't... I can't believe

21:07.850 --> 21:09.476
you don't think
that's a big deal.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.853
You were at
Chris Brown's birthday.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.856
He's such an amazing performer.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.649
Yeah, he was a cool guy,
you know.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.818
You know, it's just

21:17.944 --> 21:19.028
'cause my family's business.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.947
I get to meet a lot
of people like that.

21:21.072 --> 21:23.074
I know it
sounds weird,

21:23.199 --> 21:29.413
but you kind of get sick of
that whole scene after a while.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.791
So we should
get going.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.000
The band goes on at 11:00.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.586
Uh, yeah, yeah, my parents
should be totally cool.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.545
I will be right back.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.172
Cool.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.550
Come on, Harry.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.719
Oh! Oh!

21:43.844 --> 21:45.471
Yes! Yes!

21:47.681 --> 21:48.682
Hey.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.850
Hi.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.644
You guys taking off?

21:51.769 --> 21:54.063
Uh, yeah.

21:54.188 --> 21:57.066
I mean, if... if that's okay?

21:57.191 --> 21:59.652
Yeah. Just be home by curfew.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.571
And you...

22:02.696 --> 22:03.697
let me know how
the Bond film is.

22:03.823 --> 22:04.698
Really?

22:04.824 --> 22:06.117
Yeah.

22:06.242 --> 22:06.909
That's what you
guys wanted, right?

22:07.034 --> 22:09.578
Yeah.
Yeah.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.455
Yeah.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.665
Thanks.
Thanks.

22:12.790 --> 22:13.916
Thanks, Dad.

22:14.041 --> 22:14.917
All right, bye, guys.
Bye.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.710
Have fun.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.337
It's just you and me.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.647
Naomi, say something.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.482
You're freaking me out.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.776
Okay, I'm going

22:40.901 --> 22:42.778
to go get Ethan.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.871
Hey.
Hi.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.207
We were... we were just
heading out.

22:54.332 --> 22:57.001
Cool. Yeah, I was going
to go bowl some more.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.961
Ethan, you got to help.
Naomi's freaking out
in the parking lot.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.630
What?
What's wrong?

23:01.755 --> 23:03.966
She saw her father
with another woman.
It's crazy.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.221
I have to go with Ethan.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.896
Naomi.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.606
What's wrong?

23:19.732 --> 23:21.399
Hey...
(sobbing)

23:24.111 --> 23:26.155
Come here. Come here.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.953
I saw my dad kissing
another woman.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.791
I just... I can't
believe it, you know.

23:37.917 --> 23:38.918
I can't.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.836
Hey. It's okay.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.046
I'm sorry.

23:47.260 --> 23:50.888
It's okay.
It's okay.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.848
I'm going to take
you home, okay?

23:52.973 --> 23:54.225
Okay.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.893
I'll take care
of you, okay?

23:56.018 --> 23:58.645
Come on.
Okay.

24:16.247 --> 24:18.498
Whoa.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.293
Yeah, way too much drama.

24:20.418 --> 24:22.002
So you still up
for the movie?

24:22.128 --> 24:22.962
Yeah, man.
Yeah?

24:23.087 --> 24:24.755
Come on.
Let's go.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.923
See you later.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.057
Yeah.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.101
Naomi and Ethan-- they're...

24:37.226 --> 24:39.561
addicted to each other.

24:39.686 --> 24:40.938
Yeah.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.022
(cell phone ringing)

24:42.148 --> 24:43.774
Oh.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.818
(groans)

24:45.943 --> 24:47.778
What?

24:47.903 --> 24:49.155
"Annie.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.948
"Had to bolt
to catch set.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.784
Sorry. Call you. Ty."

24:53.909 --> 24:55.453
Great.

24:55.577 --> 24:59.623
So, you want to catch
a Bond movie?

24:59.748 --> 25:01.125
Yeah.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.542
Guys, wait up.
Navid.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.044
Dixon.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.840
DEBBIE:
Well... so much
for a family night.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.049
Yes.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.592
See, I'm just curious.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.428
Do you think that
they really didn't know

25:12.552 --> 25:15.264
that we knew they invited
all their friends
to go bowling?

25:15.389 --> 25:18.934
Well, they should be
with their friends.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.144
And we should be happy

25:20.269 --> 25:23.022
that they have so many
new friends to be with.

25:23.147 --> 25:25.816
Yeah, so why do you
look so sad, madam?

25:25.941 --> 25:28.110
I just...

25:28.235 --> 25:30.612
thought that they'd still
want to be with us.

25:30.737 --> 25:31.989
You know, sometimes.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.866
I thought that we were cooler
than our parents.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.075
No, what...?

25:35.201 --> 25:37.036
Come... we, we... are cool.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.288
Yeah, we're cool.

25:39.413 --> 25:42.166
Well, maybe we're hanging
on to family night
for all the wrong reasons.

25:42.291 --> 25:45.711
I mean, this is
about them or us.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.548
Are we about to have that

25:50.674 --> 25:54.303
"I want to have another
baby" conversation?

25:54.428 --> 25:56.889
No.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.016
But I may ask you
for a puppy.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.601
(both laughing)

26:01.727 --> 26:02.728
What level?

26:02.853 --> 26:04.522
Well, I'm a beginner,

26:04.646 --> 26:07.274
but he's on medium,
and now he wants a Les Paul.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.567
The man has good taste.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.112
I blew most of my inheritance
on a Les Paul.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.281
Spent the rest paying off
school loans, but...

26:14.407 --> 26:15.615
Really?
Yeah.

26:15.741 --> 26:16.992
Yeah, my grandfather.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.746
He gave me just about enough
to cover the essentials.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.039
Wow.

26:22.164 --> 26:24.375
Yeah. He was this really
eccentric guy, you know.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.168
He gave most of his money
to charity, and...

26:28.754 --> 26:30.130
I don't know, truth be told,

26:30.256 --> 26:32.091
even if he did give me
all that money,

26:32.216 --> 26:33.926
I probably would have done
the same thing.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.887
I've seen what that kind
of money does to people, and...

26:39.848 --> 26:40.807
Hey.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.142
I had a good time tonight.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.019
Yeah, me, too.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.229
Me, too.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.231
And you know, some day,

26:47.356 --> 26:49.149
uh, I look forward
to meeting Sammy,

26:49.275 --> 26:51.235
you know, when you think
we've been dating long enough

26:51.360 --> 26:53.028
and... not-not that
we're dating...

26:53.153 --> 26:54.905
No, but...

26:55.030 --> 26:57.283
Oh, gosh, I
wasn't assuming...

26:57.408 --> 26:58.700
that-that we
were, uh...

26:58.825 --> 26:59.993
Yeah.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.619
...dating.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.085
So, uh, what are we doing?

27:08.210 --> 27:10.129
We're colleagues.

27:10.254 --> 27:11.964
Yeah.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.341
Hanging out.

27:16.427 --> 27:18.845
I'm-I'm just going to do this.

27:24.893 --> 27:28.063
Um... now are we dating?

27:28.188 --> 27:30.190
Oh, what the hell.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.157
It was a pretty cool movie.
HARRY:
Hey, there they are.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.200
How was the movie?

27:40.326 --> 27:43.245
Uh, it was good, you know,
like any Bond movie.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.247
You know, one
that's not out yet.

27:45.372 --> 27:48.167
Ah. I thought you
had a date with Ty.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.461
Yeah. Long story.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.421
Well, it's getting
kind of late,

27:52.546 --> 27:54.381
and you still have
some chores to do.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.216
Trash, dishes...

27:56.342 --> 27:58.051
DIXON:
Right.
Fine.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.220
Yeah, and it's...
it's, you know,

28:00.346 --> 28:02.806
it's actually past my curfew,
so I'm going to go.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.682
Well, thank you so much
for joining us, Silver.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.436
Hey, do you want me to call
your mom, let her know

28:07.561 --> 28:09.438
you're on your way home?
No, actually, I already
called her, so it's fine.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.148
And thank you
so much

28:11.273 --> 28:13.150
for letting me hang.
Shut up.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.776
It was a pleasure.
Anytime.

28:14.901 --> 28:17.321
Bye.
Later, baby.
See you later.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.322
Keep working on that bowling.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.407
Come on.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.202
Let's go work
on those...

28:57.570 --> 28:59.196
Silver?

29:11.917 --> 29:13.419
What's going on?

29:13.544 --> 29:18.798
I've been staying at the women's
shelter for a few weeks now.

29:18.924 --> 29:21.134
Whoa.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.012
I did some community service
there this past summer,

29:24.137 --> 29:26.557
and there's this woman who...

29:26.682 --> 29:29.476
she lets me stay there
sometimes.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.520
Sort of knows my situation.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.813
And my mom,

29:33.939 --> 29:37.401
she drinks.

29:37.526 --> 29:41.447
When she's like this...

29:41.572 --> 29:43.532
she's a completely
different person.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.453
It's like...

29:47.578 --> 29:50.414
she screams.

29:50.539 --> 29:53.459
She, she throws things.

29:55.669 --> 29:58.130
She blames me.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.552
Sometimes...

30:03.677 --> 30:05.845
she gets so out of control...

30:09.141 --> 30:11.810
I don't know
what she's gonna do.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.063
Sometimes it scares me.

30:18.609 --> 30:19.859
Come here.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.483
I gotta talk to my dad.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.485
What?

31:01.610 --> 31:03.903
No.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.572
Dixon, I didn't...
I didn't tell you

31:05.698 --> 31:07.491
so you would tell your dad.

31:07.616 --> 31:08.784
Whoa, whoa,
just listen.
No, no,

31:08.908 --> 31:10.369
I'm already enough
of a freak at school.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.579
I don't want all the other kids
to know my mom's a drunk, too.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.331
Listen...
No, thank you
very much.

31:14.456 --> 31:15.749
No, li...

31:15.874 --> 31:17.751
You don't think I know
what you're going through?

31:17.876 --> 31:21.254
I didn't grow up
in the Cosby family.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.550
You think every other family
I lived with was like this?!

31:24.675 --> 31:26.301
No!

31:26.426 --> 31:28.178
I know what it's like

31:28.303 --> 31:30.889
to be around someone
who's wasted out of their mind!

31:35.519 --> 31:39.314
I know what that stuff does
to people.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.900
That's why I never
do it myself.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.208
Silver, look...

32:00.711 --> 32:02.921
you got to trust my dad.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.679
Or at least trust me.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.105
Silver, can I get you
something else?

32:20.230 --> 32:21.106
No.

32:21.231 --> 32:22.441
Okay,

32:22.566 --> 32:24.568
well, Silver,
you will stay here tonight,

32:24.693 --> 32:27.320
and as far as we're concerned,
until we get this figured out.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.697
Yeah, she can stay
in my room.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.073
She can stay in my room.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.032
(scoffs)

32:31.157 --> 32:32.242
(chuckling)

32:32.367 --> 32:33.952
Just trying to help.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.372
Well, it's late. I think
we should all get some sleep.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.499
Yeah. Come on.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.667
Good night.
Good night, my love.

32:40.793 --> 32:43.670
Night, Dad.
I love you.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.298
Good night, honey.
Good night.
Night, Silver.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.760
(both sigh)

32:54.807 --> 32:57.350
Your sister's still asleep.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.937
They went to bed late.

33:00.061 --> 33:03.273
Thanks, Harry,
for taking her in last night.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.066
If I had known
what was going on,

33:05.191 --> 33:06.485
if she had come to me...

33:06.610 --> 33:09.070
She's a kid. She thinks
that you hate your mother.

33:09.195 --> 33:11.197
No, I don't hate her.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.367
It's just... complicated.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.703
Well, if there's anything
that I can do,

33:16.829 --> 33:19.205
uh, you know, if you want me
to talk to your mom...

33:19.331 --> 33:20.666
No.

33:20.791 --> 33:22.876
I think it's time I did.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.423
Sweetie, if you want breakfast,
we're gonna have to order out.

33:28.548 --> 33:30.091
Penelope is sick
for a change.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.050
Mom.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.302
Yeah?

33:32.427 --> 33:35.806
I went to Dad's office
last night.

33:35.931 --> 33:40.101
And I saw him there
kissing another woman.

33:40.226 --> 33:43.062
He was all over her.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.356
I'm so sorry, Mom.

33:44.481 --> 33:48.610
Her name is Gail.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.779
I know all about her.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.790
He's been seeing her
for two years?

34:01.915 --> 34:03.458
Honey, she doesn't live in town,

34:03.583 --> 34:06.085
so they don't see each other
very often.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.630
What's, what's going on?
Are you ending it?

34:08.755 --> 34:09.882
Are you getting
a divorce?

34:10.007 --> 34:13.134
No. I don't want to break up
this family.

34:13.259 --> 34:14.553
Mom, this isn't a family!

34:14.678 --> 34:19.683
Honey, Dad and I have
a long history together, okay?

34:19.808 --> 34:23.101
We have two kids, two homes,
friends.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.856
We have a life together.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.152
Mom...

34:31.277 --> 34:33.572
what kind of life is this?

34:33.697 --> 34:38.201
Oh, sweetheart...

34:38.326 --> 34:42.080
it's one that I don't want
to lose.

34:48.712 --> 34:50.213
You can imagine my surprise

34:50.338 --> 34:52.882
when you called to say
you were coming after...

34:53.007 --> 34:56.511
Well, how long has it been
since our last altercation?

34:56.636 --> 34:59.056
I came to talk
about Silver, Mom.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.641
Well, Erin is not here
right now.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.226
She is staying
at a friend's house,

35:03.351 --> 35:05.228
Naomi's, I think, or...

35:05.353 --> 35:08.023
Are you kidding me?
Is that what you think?

35:08.147 --> 35:10.984
She hasn't been staying
at a friend's house.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.861
She has been sleeping
at a shelter.

35:12.986 --> 35:16.698
Well, she told me...

35:16.823 --> 35:19.325
Oh, how dare you

35:19.451 --> 35:21.119
give me that look.
I didn't know.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.538
Why is that?
Were you too drunk to notice?

35:23.663 --> 35:26.332
What is it these days, Mom,
alcohol or are you back on coke?

35:26.458 --> 35:28.627
Oh, let's go to another meeting
together again.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.169
Let's hold hands and give it up

35:30.295 --> 35:31.421
to our higher power.

35:31.546 --> 35:35.008
Do you realize
what you are doing to Silver?

35:35.133 --> 35:37.385
Kelly?
Hey, I thought
I told you to stay

35:37.510 --> 35:38.511
at the Wilsons'.
Hey, Mom.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.179
Where the hell
have you been staying?!

35:40.305 --> 35:41.598
You see all the trouble
you've caused?!

35:41.723 --> 35:44.392
I don't believe this, Kelly.
I can handle this, all right?

35:44.517 --> 35:45.727
No, you can't.
Neither could I.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.228
I'm not gonna stand by

35:47.353 --> 35:49.022
and watch you do to her
what you did to me.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.274
Oh, because your life
was so awful.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.359
I hate this!
Would you guys...?

35:53.485 --> 35:54.778
Your sister is just leaving,
Erin.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.404
Yes, I am.
And I am taking
her with me.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.991
You have a four-year-old
with nobody to help you

35:59.116 --> 36:02.911
unless by some miracle,
he has decided to come back

36:03.036 --> 36:04.287
and act like a dad.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.247
And now you want
to add a teenager
on top of it?

36:06.372 --> 36:09.001
Let me tell you,
she is no walk in the park.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.169
She's coming
to live with me.
Let's go.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.879
You, you lied to me,
and now you're gonna leave?

36:13.005 --> 36:15.799
Mom!
Stop it, both of you!

36:15.924 --> 36:17.926
Mom, I can't take this anymore.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.260
I can't just watch you...

36:19.385 --> 36:20.261
Oh, get out!

36:23.849 --> 36:26.018
I am tired of both of you.

36:33.441 --> 36:34.567
Good job, Mom.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.076
(chuckles)

37:25.660 --> 37:27.328
Oh-oh. Oh!

37:30.749 --> 37:31.958
Good, babe.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.001
(all chuckle)

37:33.126 --> 37:34.252
Right behind the bed.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.923
Hey, guys.

37:38.048 --> 37:39.674
Wow, what is all this?

37:39.799 --> 37:40.759
We made breakfast.

37:40.884 --> 37:43.344
And I want
everybody to sit.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.679
Oh, wow!
(laughs)

37:44.804 --> 37:45.764
Everybody's sitting.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.140
Okay. All sitting.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.433
We're having
a family breakfast.

37:48.558 --> 37:49.642
Smells great.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.644
Watch out. Watch out.
The syrup is heated.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.021
My goodness,
like a professional.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.856
Took this very seriously.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.482
Smells great.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.901
You know what we were thinking
we could maybe do

37:58.026 --> 37:59.652
for the next family night?
What?

37:59.778 --> 38:02.405
Maybe we could go see a band
at, uh, The House of Blues.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.782
That sounds great.

38:03.907 --> 38:04.950
Or the Troubadour.

38:05.075 --> 38:06.952
Or, ooh, the
one I like.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.578
Hollywood Bowl.
The Hollywood Bowl!

38:08.703 --> 38:09.662
Yes, we could go
to the Hollywood Bowl!

38:09.788 --> 38:10.997
Take a picnic?

38:11.123 --> 38:12.082
Everybody's talking
about it at school.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.458
Oh, we can bring
a picnic basket!

38:13.583 --> 38:15.334
You can do a picnic there
'cause it's outside.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.295
It is outside.
Oh, my God.
