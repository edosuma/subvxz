00:56.265 --> 00:59.977
<i>Dear Mrs. Turner,
My name is Leanne Grayson.</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:05.607
<i>I am 18 years of age and from
a good, loving family in Wisconsin.</i>

01:10.863 --> 01:12.489
<i>I hope that you will consider me</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:15.492
<i>as a responsible
and moral guardian for your son.</i>

01:17.452 --> 01:19.955
<i>I promise that I will work hard
to please you</i>

01:20.038 --> 01:21.707
<i>and to fit into your home.</i>

02:05.542 --> 02:07.669
-Do you have him?
-Who?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.740
9780 Spruce Street.

02:37.783 --> 02:40.452
It's an emergency. It's life or death.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.914
He's gone.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.041
So is Leanne.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.294
Can you hear me?

02:49.378 --> 02:51.004
They've taken Jericho.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.173
Who did you call?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.634
The police. Who do you think?

02:56.885 --> 02:59.429
Don't just stand there! Do something!

03:21.285 --> 03:23.620
<i>You did it! Good baby.</i>

03:30.043 --> 03:33.046
<i>Now, no official numbers
have been released yet,</i>

03:33.130 --> 03:38.719
<i>but apparently cult leader May Markham
is believed to be among the dead.</i>

03:39.178 --> 03:40.846
Her. This woman.

03:40.929 --> 03:45.184
This woman was in my house today,
and she took Jericho.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.812
So, the dead woman stole your baby, ma'am?

03:49.354 --> 03:50.355
No.

03:51.940 --> 03:52.983
Sean!

04:04.077 --> 04:05.078
Mr. Turner?

04:07.497 --> 04:08.707
You remember me?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.502
I'm Officer Reyes.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.173
<i>My sister wouldn't
intentionally hurt a fly.</i>

04:17.798 --> 04:20.511
She sponsors abused animals.

04:21.512 --> 04:25.098
She's a fucking patron of tired old asses.
Tell her, Sean.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.854
They'll do an autopsy.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.485
How many days at a guess?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.197
Three or four.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.871
I was going off shift,
but I recognized the address.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.665
There's something about a baby.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.378
He's not real.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.671
It's Dorothy's.

05:01.051 --> 05:04.763
You need to establish roadblocks
on a 50-mile perimeter around this city.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.350
I shouldn't have to tell you
how to do your fucking job.

05:09.393 --> 05:12.479
I don't care what I'm saying there.
Listen to me here.

05:12.563 --> 05:16.525
She faked her death. I don't know.
She was in this house.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.486
Sean, thank God.
Please tell them. Tell them about Leanne.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.281
Tell them about her family.
Tell them to find Jericho!

05:30.581 --> 05:31.665
He's in shock.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.084
Greg, could you give us a minute?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.506
-Why don't we sit over here, Dorothy?
-Okay, I'm not an invalid.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.681
-Is Dorothy upstairs?
-My office.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.808
Drug her if you have to, darling.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.436
Officers.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.646
Yeah.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.868
-Okay, from the be-fucking--
-Leanne's gone. Okay?

06:07.951 --> 06:11.371
She's taken him. And I don't know
if the uncle came in or--

06:11.455 --> 06:15.125
But he's gone, Julian.
The baby's fucking gone.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.919
Good.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.837
No bubba, no crime, right?

06:19.338 --> 06:21.089
Dorothy's up there
telling them everything.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.841
Dorothy hasn't been right
since the accident.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.511
-Hey, she's not fucking crazy.
-No one is using that word.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.846
But we have to protect ourselves.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.433
I briefed Natalie in the car.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.060
To say what?

06:33.143 --> 06:34.811
Denial.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.230
"Baby? What baby?"

06:37.689 --> 06:41.109
We dunked him in fucking holy water,
Julian. People saw!

06:41.193 --> 06:43.403
All the more reason
to get them out of here quickly

06:43.487 --> 06:45.322
before they start poking around.

06:50.452 --> 06:51.954
For fuck's sake, Sean.

06:52.621 --> 06:53.622
You see this?

06:54.456 --> 06:56.667
This could put us away for 20 years.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.382
Officer Reyes, excuse me.

07:03.465 --> 07:07.094
Officer Reyes, these defense
mechanisms are on overdrive right now.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.555
So what she really needs is some privacy.

07:11.557 --> 07:13.433
And what are you, her doctor?

07:13.517 --> 07:14.935
Kinesiologist.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.520
And close friend.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.107
Look, what happened to Dorothy, it--

07:21.149 --> 07:22.734
It was unthinkable.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.780
And right now her psyche is
protecting her. That's all that this is.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.575
Yeah, but she talked about a nanny.
A Leanne.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.995
I'm-- I'll have to ask her about that.

07:33.078 --> 07:36.665
She sent her résumé with a return address.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.169
I can't find it!

07:42.212 --> 07:44.590
Dorothy has created this
impenetrable bubble

07:44.673 --> 07:46.884
protecting her from the truth.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.761
And that's just my professional opinion.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.473
-And so the doll is a part of this?
-It was. It was.

07:53.557 --> 07:57.978
And now that she's rejecting the doll,
it's a positive step towards healing.

07:58.604 --> 08:01.815
I mean, after all, we can only see
what we can tolerate seeing.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.492
Why can't I find it?

08:22.294 --> 08:24.004
Ugly fucking thing, isn't it?

08:25.047 --> 08:26.798
-It looks so real.
-Yeah.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.675
Do you have any?

08:29.343 --> 08:31.303
Children? No.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.013
Me neither.

08:33.764 --> 08:37.058
They say it changes your life,
putting something else first.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.062
Suppose you have to experience it to know.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.730
Right.

08:41.813 --> 08:45.317
I mean, how are we ever gonna understand
what they went through?

08:46.276 --> 08:47.277
Hey?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.197
You never recover
from something like that.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.080
<i>Officer Reyes, are you still on the scene?</i>

08:58.163 --> 08:59.873
<i>What's the status on that 32?</i>

08:59.957 --> 09:02.584
False alarm. Let's clear out.

09:02.668 --> 09:03.877
<i>Copy that.</i>

09:06.505 --> 09:08.590
I hope you guys know what you're doing.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.311
Holy fuck.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.564
It is her, Julian.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.692
You know what,
my wife may be many terrible things,

09:26.775 --> 09:28.694
but she is an excellent journalist.

09:29.361 --> 09:32.281
Well, you opened your door
to the church of fuck-only-knows.

09:32.865 --> 09:35.284
But on a brighter note, they're gone now.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.202
Is that all you have to say?

09:37.661 --> 09:39.580
Who the fuck are they?
What were they practicing?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.081
What did they want with us?

09:41.707 --> 09:44.710
-How is she?
-She spun herself out.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.503
I slipped some melatonin in her tea.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.756
Homeopathic medicine saves the day,
said no one ever.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.051
Look, this woman
that she's talking about, who is she?

09:53.135 --> 09:55.721
-She's Leanne's aunt?
-A fucking cult leader.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.057
Her whole family is batshit crazy.
Best left well alone.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.269
Okay. Well, I think for once
I agree with Julian.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.938
Maybe we should recognize this
for what it is.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.023
Well, what is it?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.483
An opportunity to move forward, Sean.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.360
To let Dorothy grieve.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.445
What? No.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.114
Yes. Sean, you love her,
and that's why you're doing this.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.657
But she's grieving the wrong child.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.242
He's not dead.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.454
What I mean is,
we were giving him a loving home.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.080
We were taking care of him.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.875
He was never yours to keep, Sean.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.419
He belongs here, with us.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.108
<i>I just want to feel positive.</i>

11:05.415 --> 11:07.751
<i>No, I won't. Yell 'freaks.' Go. Go.</i>

11:07.835 --> 11:09.253
<i>Hey, freak!</i>

11:15.342 --> 11:16.426
<i>Do it.</i>

11:16.510 --> 11:19.721
<i>-Do it. Dare me, dude.</i>
<i>-Do it, do it, do it. Just do it.</i>

12:34.963 --> 12:35.964
Dorothy?

12:47.643 --> 12:48.644
Dorothy!

12:53.565 --> 12:54.775
What is this?

12:55.359 --> 12:56.360
A camera?

12:57.861 --> 13:00.072
-I...
-Did she put this in here?

13:01.782 --> 13:04.660
They have infiltrated our home, Sean.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.497
They've been watching us.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.333
Yeah. Yeah.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.460
Yeah.

14:09.641 --> 14:10.851
Oh, my God.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.772
We can't hand these out.
I mean, you can't even see her.

14:16.190 --> 14:20.152
I think we have better copies somewhere
before the magenta ran out on us.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.695
Who are they for?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.989
-The neighbors.
-Our neighbors?

14:24.072 --> 14:26.533
Yeah, I mean, we need to
canvass the neighborhood

14:26.617 --> 14:28.118
and tell everybody what happened.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.039
-How's that gonna help?
-'Cause people may have seen something.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.541
Color of a vehicle,
a direction they were headed.

14:34.625 --> 14:38.337
Anything and everything is helpful
within the first 48 hours.

14:39.671 --> 14:40.672
After that...

14:42.508 --> 14:44.259
We mustn't think about after that.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.471
-I'll do it.
-You?

14:47.554 --> 14:48.555
Yeah, I wanna help.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.098
Look at me.

14:50.682 --> 14:54.061
Look, people are less inclined
to help strangers who radiate desperation.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.814
I don't know what that is. We're hardwired
to give up on people easily.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.984
But what the public needs is reassurance.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.779
You don't have reassuring eyes, Sean.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.948
I haven't slept for two days.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.534
But you do make a good point.
We should play to our strengths.

15:08.617 --> 15:12.955
So, I'll be running base camp here.
You will be boots on the ground.

15:13.038 --> 15:16.458
Here.
Deliver these on Spruce, 19th and Walnut.

15:17.042 --> 15:20.003
Then you're buying ink
before coming home via Locust and 21st.

15:20.087 --> 15:24.675
We have... 35 hours to find him, Sean.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.720
-But we can do it, right?
-Yeah, sure.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.222
Okay. Go. Go.

16:05.507 --> 16:06.508
Sean?

16:08.760 --> 16:11.180
-Anything?
-Nothing. No one saw a thing.

16:19.730 --> 16:23.984
<i>The funeral of May Markham was held here
on the grounds of the ransacked compound.</i>

16:24.067 --> 16:26.778
<i>In attendance
was just a handful of mourners.</i>

16:26.862 --> 16:30.782
<i>Since then, the numbers have grown.
The crowd increasing by the day.</i>

16:30.866 --> 16:32.784
<i>I recognize one of the victims.</i>

16:32.868 --> 16:35.204
<i>I saw his picture on TV</i>.

16:36.038 --> 16:40.417
<i>He revived my daughter after she was
hit by a car a few years ago.</i>

16:42.211 --> 16:43.337
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:47.674 --> 16:50.636
<i>And are you a member
of the Church of the Lesser Saints?</i>

16:51.470 --> 16:54.264
I don't believe
anybody in this cult revived anyone.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.184
People believe anything.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.456
You see, they wouldn't let us film
from behind here.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.584
It was an exclusion zone.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.587
But it's a short run to the cover
of trees, so people could've escaped.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.213
There could have been survivors.

18:11.216 --> 18:14.845
Seared scallop, sweet potato,
pesto, Parmesan crisp.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.096
No, I'm not hungry.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.890
-But it's your favorite.
-No, it isn't.

18:23.312 --> 18:24.688
How goes the search?

18:25.647 --> 18:27.608
The trail goes cold seven years ago.

18:28.275 --> 18:32.237
But someone must have seen her.
I mean, someone must've been hiding her.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.033
Hey, you'll crack it.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.369
Thank you, darling, for believing in me.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.706
Your hand. What happened?

18:42.789 --> 18:44.249
I burned myself.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.714
-I'm sorry.
-Looks worse than it is.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.552
You can buy a passport
for under a thousand dollars these days.

18:56.345 --> 18:59.181
Anyone can be someone else
practically overnight.

19:00.474 --> 19:01.892
Look into that.

19:04.144 --> 19:07.481
Have you heard anything from Roscoe?
I think his car is still out front.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.983
He isn't exactly reliable.

19:10.067 --> 19:13.070
And just because he's not returning
my calls, doesn't mean they've got him.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.072
But he could still be with them, right?
Following them?

19:16.949 --> 19:18.992
This chicken sandwich is heavenly.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.578
I could've made you one.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.207
Not like this. They have a secret recipe.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.501
Fuck the sandwich. How do we find them?

19:27.584 --> 19:30.504
The Church of the Lesser Saints officially
disbanded when they went up in flames.

19:30.587 --> 19:31.588
The trail's cold.

19:31.672 --> 19:32.840
Well, we have to find them

19:32.923 --> 19:35.050
before Dorothy involves
the whole neighborhood and beyond.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.719
We can't run interference forever,
and she's not gonna stop looking.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.054
Not while they have Jericho.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.098
Who?

19:42.182 --> 19:43.976
The baby. The fucking baby.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.906
I thought we were looking for the aunt.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.700
We were.

19:59.783 --> 20:02.119
But I realized I was coming at this
from the wrong direction.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.328
She's too shrewd.

20:04.121 --> 20:07.958
She knows how to cover her tracks.
But Leanne... Leanne is green.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.295
She's naive. She's gonna make mistakes.

20:12.546 --> 20:16.091
If we can find Leanne,
she will lead us to Jericho.

20:16.175 --> 20:18.135
Leanne is our new person of interest.

20:24.558 --> 20:26.560
And you have such reassuring eyes.

20:27.895 --> 20:29.521
I use minerals.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.652
We have 12 and a half hours
to find him, Julian. Go. Go, go.

21:22.824 --> 21:25.536
So, assuming they didn't
cross any borders,

21:25.619 --> 21:27.829
and they're averaging,
say, 65 miles an hour for,

21:27.913 --> 21:29.665
I don't know, ten hours a day,

21:30.290 --> 21:32.334
they could be halfway
across the country by now.

21:33.085 --> 21:34.670
Our boy could be in Wichita.

21:35.754 --> 21:38.006
That's what you've been doing?
Making graphics?

21:40.050 --> 21:41.552
And what have you contributed?

21:41.635 --> 21:44.429
I'm boots on the ground. Awaiting orders.

21:51.019 --> 21:54.773
I'm gonna tell you something right now
that you're not gonna wanna hear.

21:55.399 --> 21:56.692
But it's the truth.

21:57.776 --> 21:58.777
Hit me.

22:02.865 --> 22:05.284
I thought you'd be
a better father than this.

22:05.826 --> 22:07.160
I honestly did.

22:07.244 --> 22:09.162
-You don't mean what you say.
-Don't I?

22:09.246 --> 22:11.081
No, you're in shock.

22:12.457 --> 22:16.461
I thought you would finally
grow the fuck up, frankly.

22:16.545 --> 22:19.256
-You miss him? I miss him too.
-Oh, please.

22:19.798 --> 22:22.009
-It's not the same.
-Fuck you, it's not the same!

22:22.092 --> 22:25.345
-Don't you raise your voice at me!
-You know what I thought?

22:25.429 --> 22:29.099
I thought you'd always protect him.
I never thought that you would...

22:29.183 --> 22:30.726
No.

22:32.477 --> 22:35.022
Go on. Say it.

22:37.149 --> 22:38.734
What if he's dead?

22:43.864 --> 22:46.116
What if you knew for certain,
what would you do?

22:48.410 --> 22:50.078
You know what I'd do.

22:50.996 --> 22:52.581
What any good mother would.

22:52.664 --> 22:54.124
-Tell me.
-I'd follow him.

22:54.625 --> 22:55.626
Where?

22:55.709 --> 22:58.879
If there was even one in a billion chance
there is something else,

22:58.962 --> 23:00.547
something more than this,

23:01.089 --> 23:04.134
-I would hold his hand on that journey.
-Knife, rope or pills?

23:05.260 --> 23:06.261
Not a rope.

23:07.179 --> 23:09.264
With my Hermès belt next to his crib.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.528
That's 48 hours.

23:22.945 --> 23:25.030
Never any good news after 48 hours.

24:08.699 --> 24:09.700
What is it?

24:13.996 --> 24:15.122
He's alive.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.209
Jericho's alive.

24:45.235 --> 24:48.238
-Morning, Noel. How's it going?
-Thanks.

24:58.832 --> 25:00.626
-Have a good day, man.
-Have a good one.
