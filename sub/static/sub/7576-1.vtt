01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.009
no, no, it's about this
community service centre.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:03.044
Community service centre.
Chaz's parents want to.

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.179
Chaz's parents want to
close the place down today,

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:06.781
close the place down today,
just because of a show

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:08.049
just because of a show
that they think is

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:09.050
that they think is
gonna out Chaz.

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:11.285
Gonna out Chaz.
We need your legal help.

01:13:11.287 --> 01:13:13.221
We need your legal help.
>>Oh, friends in need.

01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:15.056
Oh, friends in need.
Wind in my hair.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:17.125
Wind in my hair.
I'm feeling young again.

01:13:17.127 --> 01:13:18.593
I'm feeling young again.
Maybe I'll even crash

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:19.761
maybe I'll even crash
your poker party.

01:13:19.763 --> 01:13:21.562
Your poker party.
>>No, this is not

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:24.065
no, this is not
about being... homophobic.

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:24.899
About being... homophobic.
You are slandering

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.334
you are slandering
the memory of our son,

01:13:26.336 --> 01:13:27.568
the memory of our son,
who is not here

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:28.503
who is not here
to defend himself.

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:30.304
To defend himself.
>>I think you've misunderstood.

01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:31.005
I think you've misunderstood.
There is nothing

01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:31.973
there is nothing
on that video diary

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:32.974
on that video diary
about Chaz being gay.

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:34.275
About Chaz being gay.
>>But you think he was,

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:35.009
but you think he was, don't you?

01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:36.744
Don't you? I <i>know</i> he was.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:37.779
I <i>know</i> he was.
Acknowledging the truth.

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:38.846
Acknowledging the truth
is not slander.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:39.414
Is not slander.
>>You're just saying that

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:41.215
you're just saying that
because you are gay.

01:13:41.217 --> 01:13:42.617
Because you are gay.
All gay people think

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:43.951
all gay people think
everyone is gay.

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:46.554
Everyone is gay.
( Laughs ) >>Come on.

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:47.655
( Laughs ) >>Come on.
>>I don't know why

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:48.790
I don't know why
you're laughing, miss Lee.

01:13:48.792 --> 01:13:49.323
You're laughing, miss Lee.
You've broken

01:13:49.325 --> 01:13:50.691
you've broken
so many laws, I don't

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:51.793
so many laws, I don't
know where to begin.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:52.960
Know where to begin.
Expired permits,

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:54.128
expired permits,
unlawful assembly,

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.097
unlawful assembly,
rampant zoning violations,

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:56.564
rampant zoning violations,
contributing to the

01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:57.732
contributing to the
delinquency of a minor,

01:13:57.734 --> 01:13:59.600
delinquency of a minor,
creating a public nuisance,

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.002
creating a public nuisance,
countless failures

01:14:01.004 --> 01:14:03.137
countless failures
to obtain licenses or permits.

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:04.005
To obtain licenses or permits.
And I'm gonna guess

01:14:04.007 --> 01:14:04.906
and I'm gonna guess
you never got any

01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:05.673
you never got any
consent forms signed

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:07.975
consent forms signed
by any of the parents, did you?

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:15.683
So here's the situation.
Either we shut this

01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:17.018
either we shut this
place down completely,

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:18.786
place down completely,
or you hand over

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.121
or you hand over
anything created by

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:21.923
anything created by
or pertaining to Chaz young

01:14:21.925 --> 01:14:23.357
or pertaining to Chaz young
to his parents.

01:14:23.359 --> 01:14:24.926
To his parents.
>>Sorry to interrupt.

01:14:24.928 --> 01:14:26.227
Sorry to interrupt.
Miss Lee, your attorney,

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:28.496
miss Lee, your attorney,
Mr. ira Goldman is here.

01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:29.697
Mr. ira Goldman is here.
Dad, you remember

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:31.766
dad, you remember
Mr. and Mrs. young, right?

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:33.367
Mr. and Mrs. young, right?
>>I'm sorry we're not meeting

01:14:33.369 --> 01:14:35.369
I'm sorry we're not meeting
under happier circumstances.

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:36.871
Under happier circumstances.
>>Please, Mr. Goldman,

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:37.905
please, Mr. Goldman,
don't interfere.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:38.673
Don't interfere. All we're doing

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:39.707
all we're doing
is trying to protect

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:40.942
is trying to protect
the memory of our son.

01:14:40.944 --> 01:14:41.843
The memory of our son.
>>How do you think

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:43.077
how do you think
Chaz would feel if he knew

01:14:43.079 --> 01:14:44.045
Chaz would feel if he knew
you were trying to

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:45.213
you were trying to
shut down the firehouse...

01:14:45.215 --> 01:14:46.013
Shut down the firehouse...
The only place

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:47.081
the only place
in the world where

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:48.182
in the world where
he could be himself?

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:49.917
He could be himself?
>>That's not true.

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:52.286
That's not true.
What do you know?

01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:54.288
What do you know?
>>A lot more than you think.

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:55.490
A lot more than you think.
>>You all want the whole world

01:14:55.492 --> 01:14:57.325
you all want the whole world
to think Chaz was abnormal.

01:14:57.327 --> 01:14:59.093
To think Chaz was abnormal.
>>You mean gay?

01:14:59.095 --> 01:15:00.828
You mean gay? Like my son?

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.998
Like my son?
>>Your family is your business.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.933
Your family is your business.
Our family is ours.

01:15:05.935 --> 01:15:07.468
Our family is ours.
>>Speaking of family,

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.070
speaking of family,
have you located Nick?

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:17.072
( Line ringing )

01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:32.654
( Line ringing ) Jeez.

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:43.437
( Indistinct chatter )

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:51.439
I'm Jesus... I can help you.

01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:59.915
Hey, Edie! Edie!
You want to play angel cards?

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:06.460
Boy, you pay in for the story?

01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:14.462
Edie, go get us some burgers!

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:24.239
Eat your burger first.
What's so important

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.317
what's so important
in that computer?

01:16:29.319 --> 01:16:31.152
In that computer?
>>Chaz said if he was

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:32.253
Chaz said if he was
abducted by aliens,

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:33.154
abducted by aliens, I could read

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:34.555
I could read
everything he wrote.

01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:35.169
( Beeps )

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:51.399
Maybe I forced him to lie...
By the way I am.

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:56.711
By the way I am.
>>No. Lying to others

01:16:56.713 --> 01:16:58.012
no. Lying to others is okay.

01:16:58.014 --> 01:16:59.981
Is okay. But lying to yourself

01:16:59.983 --> 01:17:01.482
but lying to yourself
is not okay.

01:17:01.484 --> 01:17:03.017
Is not okay. I used to have an

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:04.251
I used to have an
angel card for lies,

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:05.519
angel card for lies,
and if I didn't want

01:17:05.521 --> 01:17:06.587
and if I didn't want
to tell somebody something,

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:09.023
to tell somebody something,
I would just kind of...

01:17:09.025 --> 01:17:10.891
I would just kind of... ( Beep )

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:12.193
( Beep ) I wish I had somebody

01:17:12.195 --> 01:17:15.062
I wish I had somebody
that loved me like that.

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:16.631
That loved me like that.
Will you cry for me

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:18.833
will you cry for me
when I'm gone, Nick?

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:23.838
Mother of God... "I love Nick".

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.538
"I love Nick". >>What?

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.906
What? "I love Nick"!

01:17:25.908 --> 01:17:27.642
"I love Nick"! That's the code!

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:30.011
That's the code!
>>You're... you're crazy.

01:17:30.013 --> 01:17:31.712
You're... you're crazy. >>No!

01:17:31.714 --> 01:17:35.850
No! >>"I... love... Nick".

01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:37.084
"I... love... Nick". ( Beep )

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:37.952
( Beep ) That was the.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:38.552
That was the stupidest password.

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:39.654
Stupidest password.
I mean, the only person

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:42.590
I mean, the only person
who really loved him...

01:17:42.592 --> 01:17:43.092
Chaz!

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:56.671
Inbox, 48. Drafts, 11.
>>Dear Nick...

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:58.839
Dear Nick...
I need to tell you something.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.174
I need to tell you something.
But I can't seem to

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:01.876
but I can't seem to
do it in person,

01:18:01.878 --> 01:18:03.344
do it in person,
so I'm gonna try it

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:04.245
so I'm gonna try it
the firehouse way.

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:05.813
The firehouse way.
I encourage the kids

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:07.415
I encourage the kids
that I mentor there

01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:08.916
that I mentor there
to tell stories

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:10.451
to tell stories in video diary.

01:18:10.453 --> 01:18:11.786
In video diary.
The kids, like you,

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:13.120
the kids, like you,
look up to me.

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:16.257
Look up to me. But...

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:19.093
But... what you don't know is...

01:18:19.095 --> 01:18:23.064
Is that I'm a fraud
and a coward.

01:18:23.066 --> 01:18:23.764
And a coward. By definition,

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:25.166
by definition,
I'm a different breed

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:26.233
I'm a different breed
from our parents,

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:28.602
from our parents,
and so are you, Nick.

01:18:28.604 --> 01:18:30.405
And so are you, Nick.
You live in this bubble,

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:32.607
you live in this bubble,
but you're always the real you.

01:18:32.608 --> 01:18:34.508
But you're always the real you.
And...

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:37.511
And... but you don't pretend.

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:39.280
But you don't pretend.
And I've always been

01:18:39.282 --> 01:18:40.648
and I've always been
jealous of that.

01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:42.783
Jealous of that.
They say that aspies

01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:43.884
they say that aspies
can't communicate.

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:46.854
Can't communicate.
Oh, they are wrong.

01:18:46.856 --> 01:18:48.556
Oh, they are wrong.
You... you laugh, you sulk,

01:18:48.558 --> 01:18:50.725
you... you laugh, you sulk,
you roll on the floor.

01:18:50.727 --> 01:18:51.325
You roll on the floor.
You communicate,

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:53.427
you communicate,
if not only in words,

01:18:53.429 --> 01:18:55.262
if not only in words, in moods.

01:18:55.264 --> 01:19:00.267
Soon I'm gonna tell
the world I'm gay.

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:01.135
The world I'm gay.
And when the shit

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:01.836
and when the shit hits the fan,

01:19:01.838 --> 01:19:03.304
hits the fan, I'm gonna need you

01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:05.639
I'm gonna need you
to watch my back.

01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:07.675
To watch my back.
I love you, bro.

01:19:07.677 --> 01:19:12.379
Chaz needs me.

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:20.381
Wow! I should take
you to 'nam, man!

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:23.858
You to 'nam, man!
They love orange there.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.192
They love orange there.

01:19:25.194 --> 01:19:28.295
The sun, the monks' robes,

01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:31.165
the monks' robes,
row houses painted orange.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:32.967
Row houses painted orange.
Oh, those guys really

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:33.901
oh, those guys really
celebrated life.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:35.803
Celebrated life.
Too bad we had to

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:37.404
too bad we had to
kill so many of 'em.

01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:38.806
Kill so many of 'em.
>>Thanks, Jim.

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.574
( Continues indistinctly )

01:19:40.576 --> 01:19:48.576
Grandma said a long time ago
that vietnamese people

01:20:02.698 --> 01:20:05.032
that vietnamese people
used to eat coconut frogs.

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:06.567
Used to eat coconut frogs.
Oh, yeah.

01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:08.435
Oh, yeah. Coconut <i>and </i> frogs.

01:20:08.437 --> 01:20:09.937
Coconut <i>and </i> frogs.
They'd take a coconut.

01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:11.872
They'd take a coconut
and make a small cut

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:13.541
and make a small cut
and insert a tadpole.

01:20:13.543 --> 01:20:14.809
And insert a tadpole.
Then, a few weeks later,

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:16.076
then, a few weeks later,
they'd open up the coconut

01:20:16.078 --> 01:20:18.445
they'd open up the coconut
to find a blind frog

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:19.914
to find a blind frog
with white skin.

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:22.049
With white skin.

if I didn't say it,
it wouldn't be true,

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:40.227
it wouldn't be true,
