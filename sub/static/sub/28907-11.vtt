We've been knocking out

02:24.470 --> 02:26.210

is a long-term project.

the supercar build

of design for us to go off of.

about the timeline.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.930
So this is gonna be
our only build for five months?

03:25.940 --> 03:27.330
Absolutely not.
We still have to stay open

03:27.340 --> 03:30.740
and make money.
-And we were right.

03:30.740 --> 03:33.010
Josh: It was a delicate business
getting that chop right,

03:33.010 --> 03:34.370

-This thing is long.
-Really long, really wide.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.280
On this build,
everything's gonna be custom

03:38.280 --> 03:39.380
from the frame up.

03:39.380 --> 03:42.020
Richard gave us an unheard of
$300,000

03:42.020 --> 03:43.920
to build the supercar
he envisioned.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.990
Anything's possible.
It's just takes money.

03:46.990 --> 03:49.790
We even went to chris alston to
get the best chassis we could,

03:49.790 --> 03:53.190
but making a chassis
from scratch takes time.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.560
No matter how much you spend,
everything takes time.

from katech,

03:58.930 --> 04:00.170

it'll be bitchin',

04:00.170 --> 04:02.700
it hasn't arrived yet.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.240
Everything has to be
carefully chosen,

04:04.240 --> 04:05.770
even down
to the paint color,

04:05.770 --> 04:07.570
because it's going to be
on display at s.E.M.A.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.140
And judged by our peers.

04:09.140 --> 04:13.950
And the rivi was just one of
our many challenging builds.

04:13.950 --> 04:16.150
But richard kept throwing us
curve balls.

04:16.150 --> 04:18.120
We had to recreate
the "bullitt" mustang

04:18.120 --> 04:20.520
and it had to withstand
punishment in san francisco

04:20.520 --> 04:23.860
for three days.

04:23.860 --> 04:25.560
Then almost immediately we
rolled right into

04:25.560 --> 04:26.560
a high profile build,

04:26.560 --> 04:27.890
dropping a hellcrate motor

04:27.900 --> 04:31.730
into
an international scout.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.200
And then we had
the opportunity of a lifetime

04:34.200 --> 04:35.740
to work with
barry williams

04:35.740 --> 04:39.670
and gas monkey up
the iconic brady station wagon.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.110
We went back in time and made
a '52 chevy grocery getter

04:42.110 --> 04:46.150
into a nascar special.

04:46.150 --> 04:48.250
And if that wasn't enough
of a time suck,

04:48.250 --> 04:49.250
we had our hands full

04:49.250 --> 04:51.590
resurrecting
a '33 ford shop truck

04:51.590 --> 04:53.520
we pulled out
of brian bass's garage.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.090
Whoo!

04:56.090 --> 04:58.130
And speaking of bass, he had
to step away for a while

04:58.130 --> 04:59.630
to work on
some other projects.

04:59.630 --> 05:02.560
So now we're all carrying the
torch as far as design decisions

05:02.560 --> 05:05.330
and seeing the project
through to the end.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.700
These things are so big
it's unreal.

05:06.700 --> 05:07.870
Our priority for the day

05:07.870 --> 05:09.670
is to get the measurements
for the wheels,

05:09.670 --> 05:13.710
and that entails putting on
the front suspension...

05:13.710 --> 05:16.440
And putting on
the front body panels, fenders,

05:16.450 --> 05:18.950
core support, making sure
they're in the right place.

05:18.950 --> 05:20.380
Then we can muck up the wheels.

05:20.380 --> 05:22.420
Okay. You stand there.
Look pretty.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.620
-It's what I do best.
-Every piece helps.

05:24.620 --> 05:25.990
Every bit of mockup
we can do

05:25.990 --> 05:27.120
will help square up
the front end,

05:27.120 --> 05:28.490
help true up everything

05:28.490 --> 05:31.630
so that we can make the right
measurement from our spindle

05:31.630 --> 05:33.990
and hub
to our inside of our fender

05:34.000 --> 05:35.260
which will determine our
wheel offset.

05:35.260 --> 05:36.360
I mean, there's a ton of

05:36.370 --> 05:37.760
different measurements
we need to take.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.670
This is ride height?
-Yeah.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.230
But if we don't do this
properly,

05:41.240 --> 05:42.670
it can mess up
a lot of measurements.

05:42.670 --> 05:45.240
I mean, the wheels
are a big one.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.970
Hey, come here for a sec.
Something doesn't look right.

hammered than that.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.450
Josh:
That ride height's wrong.

05:53.450 --> 05:55.950
The car should be sitting
a couple inches lower.

05:55.950 --> 05:57.520
See, that's what sucks
about stopping.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.050
Yeah, because
we're [bleep] lost.

05:59.050 --> 06:00.420
We'll be pulled off
for a few weeks.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.320
Just kind of --
it kills your flow,

06:02.320 --> 06:05.160
and that means we have no idea
why the ride height is off,

06:05.160 --> 06:07.190
so we've got to take some time
to figure it out

06:07.200 --> 06:09.860
because this is not the vision
we discussed with richard.

first hit the streets in 1959.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.160
It was chevy's take
on a new type of ride.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.700
Based on
a station wagon platform,

07:15.700 --> 07:17.430
it combined the usefulness
of a truck

07:17.430 --> 07:20.200
and the drivability
of a sedan.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.370

despite the odd-looking auto

but I'm a fan of that year
el camino

07:51.030 --> 07:52.500
and they're actually
gaining in popularity

07:52.500 --> 07:53.470
because you get some power.

07:53.470 --> 07:54.500
They came with 350s

of horsepower

07:55.570 --> 07:57.500
compared to most
of the things in '78.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.240
So if I can get it
for a low price,

07:59.240 --> 08:00.540
say less than
three grand,

08:00.540 --> 08:03.710

we've built some
wicked awesome tubs.

39:41.410 --> 39:43.880
They're super clean.
What more could you ask for?

39:43.880 --> 39:45.980
How about
a full independent suspension

39:45.980 --> 39:49.080
from chris alston chassis works,
front and rear independent?

39:49.080 --> 39:51.650
For the rear end housing,
we went with fab9.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.890
For the shocks, obviously
we went with varishocks,

39:54.890 --> 39:57.490
and quick performance
for our complete third member.

39:57.490 --> 39:59.760
Top it all off,
we got some huge diffusers

39:59.760 --> 40:01.490
for that supercar look
to get the air out

40:01.500 --> 40:02.560
from underneath this bad boy.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.100
Man,
what a badass stance.

40:07.830 --> 40:09.470
Mike: When you're building
a car of this caliber,

40:09.470 --> 40:12.300
paint and body is just
as important as everything else.

40:12.310 --> 40:13.710
We've already had
the car sandblasted

40:13.710 --> 40:16.370
and the guys are already done
with their metalwork.

40:16.380 --> 40:19.740
As pretty as it will be fully
dressed for the super paint job,

40:19.750 --> 40:22.210
we decided let everyone see
under the clothes

40:22.220 --> 40:25.220
and reveal all
that badass custom fab work.

40:25.220 --> 40:26.850
Eventually we'll have the time
to get this car

40:26.850 --> 40:29.090
painted the battleship gray
that we've all picked out.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.520
We all love the color,

40:30.520 --> 40:32.220
and it's going to look great
when it's sitting at s.E.M.A.

40:34.960 --> 40:38.360
Jason:
When we set out to turn our
1972 riviera into a supercar,

40:38.370 --> 40:39.830
we knew
we needed a power plant

40:39.830 --> 40:41.170
that was worthy of the job.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.270
We called our friends at katech,
and they hooked up

40:43.270 --> 40:46.940
with this one-of-a-kind
generation five lt4 engine

40:46.940 --> 40:48.910
paired with
a magnuson supercharger.

40:48.910 --> 40:51.210
This thing
is 1,000 horsepower

40:51.210 --> 40:54.110
and puts out 1,000 pounds
of torque on top of that.

40:54.110 --> 40:56.650
Talk about making a statement,
that's exactly what they did.

40:56.650 --> 40:58.420
And that paired
with our ron davis radiator

40:58.420 --> 40:59.880
to keep everything cool,

40:59.890 --> 41:01.890
that's exactly
what it's gonna be at s.E.M.A.

41:01.890 --> 41:03.490
You know how we'd like to stop?

41:03.490 --> 41:06.220
It's wilwood brakes'
cylinder kit and brakes.

41:06.230 --> 41:09.460
We've put in super comfy
recaro racing seats

41:09.460 --> 41:12.100
and eventually vintage air ac.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.070
Ambitious project?
Absolutely.

41:17.070 --> 41:19.970
Bitchin' project?
Absolutely.

41:19.970 --> 41:23.040
Going to s.E.M.A.?
Yes, but under construction.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.740
But I don't mind, 'cause
this car is going to be badass.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.150
Watch for it.

41:27.150 --> 41:28.780
Look out s.E.M.A.
Here we come.
