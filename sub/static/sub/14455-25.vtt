00:12.200 --> 00:15.100
Narrator: Coming up, Is Sal
the voice of his generation?

00:15.100 --> 00:20.200
When my parents came to this
country, they had nothing.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.533
What's got Q
vegging out?

00:22.533 --> 00:25.467
It looks like a cauliflower,
but, like, you know, with tits.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.733
And which losing Joker
will be painted into a corner

00:29.733 --> 00:31.067
in tonight's punishment?

00:33.733 --> 00:36.433
Sal: Prepare for
something amazing.

00:36.433 --> 00:37.467
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:39.133 --> 00:40.800
Murr: I want my mommy!

00:42.600 --> 00:45.400
Sal: I will never forgive you!

00:45.400 --> 00:46.867
Joe: Larry!

00:51.433 --> 00:52.567
Today, we're at Alley,

00:52.567 --> 00:54.433
a workspace community
for entrepreneurs,

00:54.433 --> 00:57.000
conducting surveys
about employee satisfaction.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.500
While going through the survey,
we're gonna have to do

00:58.500 --> 00:59.767
and say what the
other guys tell us.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.233
The goal is to get
through the survey

01:01.233 --> 01:03.067
without refusing
anything.

01:03.067 --> 01:05.067
If you refuse,
you lose.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.400
-Hello.
-This is Jessica.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.567
-Hi.
-This is Joe.

01:10.567 --> 01:12.600
Joe. Hello. Good to see you.
Hey, Jessica.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.067
"That's my dog's name."

01:14.067 --> 01:15.067
-Yes.

01:15.067 --> 01:16.567
Yeah,
that's my dog's name.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.367
I'm a new employee.

01:20.367 --> 01:21.667
Oh, you're new. Great.
How long have you been here?

01:21.667 --> 01:23.100
Since June 8th.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.700
Joe, count how many
days that's been.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.733
So...five, six days.

01:27.733 --> 01:29.300
I'm sorry. Hold on.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.700
"It's, like, 200 days."

01:35.700 --> 01:37.200
That's, like, 200 days.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.667
Wait, is that right?

01:38.667 --> 01:39.833
Oh, no, it's 30.
It's 30.

01:41.867 --> 01:44.233
Lick your entire palm
to turn the page.

01:44.233 --> 01:48.100
So, um, I spoke
to somebody earlier...

01:49.300 --> 01:51.200
Do it again.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.700
He said, uh...

01:52.700 --> 01:54.267
Yeah. They spoke to
a Francesca, as well,

01:54.267 --> 01:56.133
who -- I don't know
if you these people...

01:58.567 --> 02:00.867
Stick both your feet
straight out.

02:00.867 --> 02:01.900
Like, under the table.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.233
This is a question
they want me to ask.

02:03.233 --> 02:04.767
Do you understand
the strategic goals

02:04.767 --> 02:06.833
of the broader
organization?

02:08.900 --> 02:10.433
And now, swim up
and down with your legs.

02:10.433 --> 02:12.900
I think there could
always be more, like...

02:14.900 --> 02:16.533
You think there
could be more?

02:16.533 --> 02:18.500
You look like
a fat baby.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.333
I feel like "yes."
Yeah.

02:21.333 --> 02:24.533
Take your shoes and socks
off with your feet.

02:24.533 --> 02:25.967
And were you always
in this industry?

02:25.967 --> 02:28.233
-Not always...
-There you go.

02:28.233 --> 02:31.067
Now, use your toes.
Take those socks off.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.067
Joe: Sales?

02:32.067 --> 02:33.800
Were you always
in, like...

02:33.800 --> 02:36.567
Come on, Joe.
You can do it.

02:36.567 --> 02:38.500
My God, you look
like a baby.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.900
Look at his upper body,
just slowly jiggling.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.400
He has no dexterity
with his toes.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.067
Sal: Keep licking your hand
and turning the pages

02:46.067 --> 02:48.067
while you do it.

02:48.067 --> 02:50.233
There's, uh...

02:50.233 --> 02:52.067
Your commute here,
is it...

02:52.067 --> 02:54.600
bearable?
-Yeah.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.567
He doesn't even know
what to say anymore.

02:56.567 --> 02:59.800
He's just concentrating
on his stupid socks.

02:59.800 --> 03:03.367
He's, like, "So, you need to
commute in order to get here?"

03:03.367 --> 03:05.933
-Get the sock off!
-Get the sock off.

03:05.933 --> 03:08.233
Step on your toes
and pull it out.

03:08.233 --> 03:11.500
Murr: You've never taken your
socks off with your feet before?

03:14.067 --> 03:17.067
Use your big toe on the other
foot to pull the heel down!

03:17.067 --> 03:19.333
Joe, are you --
Are you having a stroke?

03:19.333 --> 03:21.467
Joe, if you smell burned toast,
get out of there.

03:21.467 --> 03:24.300
You have no dexterity
in your feet.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.933
We kind of covered
a lot of ground here.

03:25.933 --> 03:27.433
-Now, he's got it.
-Yeah!

03:27.433 --> 03:29.400
Point your feet
and start swimming.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.433
Um, and would you say
leading the team

03:31.433 --> 03:33.667
is as important as
following, at times?

03:35.867 --> 03:38.467
Now, try to put
your socks and shoes back on

03:38.467 --> 03:40.167
only using your feet.

03:40.167 --> 03:41.433
Oh, forget it.

03:41.433 --> 03:42.800
I mean, we're not gonna be
able to any of that.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.467
I'm kind of done
with it.

03:45.467 --> 03:47.933
Yea, it's a whole situation
that it's happened.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.800
Throw a vase against
the wall and get out.

03:51.900 --> 03:55.067
-Didn't break.
-It didn't even break!

03:55.067 --> 03:56.700
Thank you
for your time.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.567
Joe, the odds were high that
that should have broke.

03:59.567 --> 04:03.433
You threw a delicate ceramic
vase against a wood floor.

04:03.433 --> 04:05.933
You guys had me doing the
thing with the everything!

04:05.933 --> 04:08.067
My feet cramped up.
I couldn't even --

04:08.067 --> 04:09.967
I had charley horse
like a mother.

04:09.967 --> 04:13.867
I'm trying to ask her
if she likes being a leader.

04:13.867 --> 04:15.233
And that was
not ceramic.

04:15.233 --> 04:18.867
That was a well-made vase.
you guys.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.567
-Good. Good.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.367
Sal, ask him if
he wants water.

04:25.367 --> 04:26.667
Can I get you
a drink of water?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.667
No, I just drunk some
when I came down.

04:28.667 --> 04:30.200
-Okay.
-"I'll take some."

04:30.200 --> 04:32.200
All right,
I'll have some.

04:35.433 --> 04:36.800
Uh, you want me
to get you water?

04:36.800 --> 04:37.800
Um, please.

04:42.233 --> 04:43.900
Thank you so much.
That's so nice of you.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.700
I didn't know
where they were, so...

04:45.700 --> 04:47.800
Drink from your cup
of water.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.133
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

04:49.133 --> 04:50.700
Thank you.
Delicious.

04:53.233 --> 04:54.800
Well, your pants are a little
uncomfortable, buddy.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.533
You want to stand up
and just adjust everything

04:56.533 --> 04:59.133
and then sit back down?

04:59.133 --> 05:00.233
There he goes.

05:09.167 --> 05:10.533
Murr: So weird.

05:10.533 --> 05:11.767
Joe: Sal, tell him stories
about your boss,

05:11.767 --> 05:13.233
but when you do
an impression of your boss,

05:13.233 --> 05:16.333
make it the worst
accent you can.

05:16.333 --> 05:17.633
I had one job that --

05:17.633 --> 05:19.333
I had a boss that --
he wasn't the best.

05:19.333 --> 05:20.800
Like, one time,
we were in the break room,

05:20.800 --> 05:22.100
and he opened
the fridge.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.433
He saw his lunch was missing,
and he was, like,

05:24.433 --> 05:28.067
"Did somebody eat my lunch?
It was in this bag."

05:32.367 --> 05:33.967
And he's, like, you know,
"I don't know what to say.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.300
Somebody's eating my food.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.267
They don't respect me,
do you know what I mean?"

05:38.267 --> 05:40.200
"And then he went on,
like, this minute monologue

05:40.200 --> 05:42.833
that I have memorized."

05:42.833 --> 05:45.133
And then, he went on, like,
a minute monologue, you know,

05:45.133 --> 05:48.467
and he's, like, "When my parents
came to this country,

05:48.467 --> 05:49.933
they had nothing.

05:49.933 --> 05:54.500
They had to work so hard to get
even where they wanted me to be,

05:54.500 --> 05:57.967
and I built my empire
from the ground up.

05:57.967 --> 06:00.867
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
come into this break room

06:00.867 --> 06:04.067
to have a break
and I can't even have my break."

06:05.667 --> 06:08.300
Q: This guy wants nothing
to do with Sal at all.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.867
All right, well,
thank you so much.

06:09.867 --> 06:10.967
I'll see you around.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.467
So, what do you do here?

06:16.467 --> 06:19.300
-I am head of hospitality here.
-Head of hospitality.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.300
"You get the peanuts
and bull."

06:21.300 --> 06:24.067
So you get, like, the peanuts
and bull for people?

06:24.067 --> 06:26.700
-Yep.
-Got it.
-Oh...

06:26.700 --> 06:28.633
Joe: "Sorry if I come off
a little flustered."

06:28.633 --> 06:31.167
So, me -- I'm sorry if I'm
coming off a little flustered.

06:31.167 --> 06:34.233
"There was a pregnant woman who
just chewed out this nice dude."

06:34.233 --> 06:36.800
There was, uh, there was this,
um, pregnant woman

06:36.800 --> 06:40.500
who just chewed out
this nice, uh, dude.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.133
"He had a beard
and lavender shirt."

06:42.133 --> 06:45.667
He had a beard and, like, this
pretty, purple lavender shirt.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.667
Oh, yeah.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.100
"She just chewed him out for
keeping his seat on the subway."

06:50.100 --> 06:51.267
She really
chewed him out

06:51.267 --> 06:53.067
for not giving up
his seat on the subway.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.133
Okay.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.200
Honestly, the guy
seemed nice to me.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.400
And she was, like, she made it
eight and a half months

06:58.400 --> 07:00.933
without sitting on the train.
Like, you need to sit now?

07:00.933 --> 07:03.800
Plus, I'm all about equality
and, like, you know...

07:03.800 --> 07:05.067
Yeah -- I mean,
he's all about...

07:07.633 --> 07:09.733
I mean, he's all
about equality.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.267
He did not give up
the seat.

07:11.267 --> 07:12.300
Oh.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.633
I think he was
trying to prove a point.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.900
"Luckily, some other pregnant
woman gave up her seat."

07:17.600 --> 07:21.933
So...So, actually, another
pregnant woman gave up her seat

07:21.933 --> 07:23.567
'cause she was more
pregnant than her.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.167
If you could, like,
pick your ultimate career,

07:28.167 --> 07:29.467
what's, like,
the ultimate goal?

07:29.467 --> 07:31.133
-Your pants, they still
bugging you?
-Yeah.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.500
Yeah. Why don't you go
fix them?

07:33.500 --> 07:35.767
Outside the window.

07:35.767 --> 07:36.767
I like to dance.

07:36.767 --> 07:38.067
-Oh, you love to dance.
-I do.

07:38.067 --> 07:39.400
-Hip hop.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.067
Hip hop.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.700
But I've also been
to India...

07:46.867 --> 07:48.100
Knock on the window
and be, like, "Enough,"

07:48.100 --> 07:49.133
and just send him away.

07:50.667 --> 07:51.700
Enough.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.833
Sal: "Can a guy rock a tank
here on the clock?"

07:57.833 --> 08:01.667
Can a guy rock a tank here
on the clock, or no?

08:01.667 --> 08:03.800
-Uh, no.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.733
"I like to show off
this sweet tat I got."

08:05.733 --> 08:07.833
'Cause I like to show off,
like, my sweet tats.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.867
Right. Yeah.

08:09.867 --> 08:11.300
Like...

08:11.300 --> 08:15.067
It says "38, lives alone,
has three cats."

08:15.067 --> 08:16.800
You have a cat?

08:16.800 --> 08:17.867
-Aww.
-Aww.

08:17.867 --> 08:18.733
"Stupid name."

08:21.733 --> 08:23.233
All right, well,
thank you so much.

08:23.233 --> 08:24.233
Yep.

08:26.567 --> 08:27.600
Sal: Got him.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.267
Oh, here we go.

08:33.233 --> 08:34.267
I'm great.

08:34.267 --> 08:35.300
Okay, so,
I work for

08:35.300 --> 08:36.333
an independent
HR company, basically.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.733
Right.

08:37.733 --> 08:40.067
Mention that you're dating a
Caribbean girl, then keep going.

08:40.067 --> 08:42.067
What I'm going to do is,
go through a list of questions.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.433
Feel free to be honest.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.567
I should also mention that,
I am dating a Caribbean woman...

08:45.567 --> 08:47.467
-Oh. Okay.
-...which is great.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.233
Be surprised
at how the pen works.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.067
Um...

08:53.067 --> 08:54.300
Oh. Oh, I --
Oh, I get it.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.433
I've never seen
that technology.

09:00.433 --> 09:02.233
Murr, you want to pound
the table while you talk?

09:02.233 --> 09:04.133
Are there incentives that
you would love to have?

09:04.133 --> 09:06.967
Like, like, like your friends
have at other companies,

09:06.967 --> 09:08.467
you want it,
too, you know?

09:08.467 --> 09:09.567
So, take me though,
like, maybe --

09:09.567 --> 09:12.167
maybe, like, one
or two of those things

09:12.167 --> 09:16.533
that would just make
this company so much better.

09:16.533 --> 09:17.833
I would say, um...

09:19.967 --> 09:22.600
...just the atmosphere
the environment brings...

09:22.600 --> 09:24.600
Murr, glance
at your phone.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.933
"Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry."

09:25.933 --> 09:28.567
-...collaborations between --
-I'm sorry.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.767
"My dumbass grandparents
keep texting me."

09:32.700 --> 09:35.133
My dumbass grandparents
keep texting me.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.267
Grab those scissors
right there,

09:40.267 --> 09:43.067
and cut that paper
right in half.

09:43.067 --> 09:45.167
Tell me what the best day
at the office would be for you.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.300
Joe: Keep cutting the same
one smaller and smaller.

09:47.300 --> 09:50.133
Um, best day at
the office would be...

09:51.833 --> 09:53.967
At the end of one of her
sentences, go, "Ha, ha!"

09:53.967 --> 09:57.967
...making sure that they feel
welcome and that, um, we're...

09:57.967 --> 09:58.967
Ha, ha.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.300
Cut those papers
into a million pieces.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.300
Right now,
since I'm a facilitator

10:06.300 --> 10:08.667
on the second floor
for the Horizon team,

10:08.667 --> 10:10.533
we were discussing
how the community

10:10.533 --> 10:11.867
can be more
involved with...

10:13.933 --> 10:16.033
I feel like our bandwidth
for operations...

10:18.400 --> 10:19.600
Sal: Look how little
it's getting.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.700
...resolve our member issues
in a timely manner.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.133
Got it.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.633
Um...

10:28.633 --> 10:30.867
Murr, wave your hand
in a general direction and go,

10:30.867 --> 10:32.233
"Well, you must be
happy that every day

10:32.233 --> 10:35.167
is, apparently,
dress-down day here."

10:35.167 --> 10:37.433
Um, now, talking --

10:37.433 --> 10:38.833
Talking about the perks
of the job...

10:38.833 --> 10:40.333
-Yeah.
-...you must be very happy

10:40.333 --> 10:42.033
that every day
is dress-down day here.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.900
So, I think we're all
wrapped up today,

10:46.900 --> 10:49.167
and I just wanted to say,
on behalf of Alley...

10:49.167 --> 10:51.000
thank you so much.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.233
Joe: And that's a win.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.700
Narrator: It was a hard day
at the office for Joe and Q,

10:55.700 --> 10:58.867
so they're first up
on the loser board.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.067
Today, we're in the park
gazing up at clouds.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.200
And we'll have to approach
strangers and describe

11:03.200 --> 11:05.267
what image we think
we see in the clouds.

11:05.267 --> 11:06.467
But the weird thing
we see will be

11:06.467 --> 11:08.167
given to us
by the other guys.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.300
If you can't get
the stranger to admit

11:09.300 --> 11:11.233
they see what you see,
you lose.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.267
And...

11:14.700 --> 11:16.133
Chika,
what's going on?

11:16.133 --> 11:18.300
Every other dog in New York City
gets people over to pet them.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.133
What are you doing?
-Look on the edge here.

11:20.133 --> 11:22.933
Look at this side, then Sal,
look at this side.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.167
See this side, here?

11:24.167 --> 11:25.167
And then, look at this side
how it's right --

11:29.133 --> 11:30.933
Sal: That guy's got papoose
strapped to his chest.

11:30.933 --> 11:33.133
Got the pampoose.
That what that is, right?
A pampoose?

11:33.133 --> 11:34.400
-Papoose.
-Papoose.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.433
Oh, it's a
speech impediment.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.867
You just put more
letters into a word.

11:36.867 --> 11:38.667
Everything that you do that you
call a speech impediment --

11:38.667 --> 11:41.400
that's 20 different things --
are just mistakes.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.067
Down, Chika. Down, Chik.
This is Chika.

11:46.067 --> 11:47.433
She's very friendly.
You can pet her.

11:47.433 --> 11:48.800
She loves coming here.
I love coming here, too.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.767
I like cloud wa--
I'm a big cloud watcher.

11:52.433 --> 11:53.833
You see this one
right here?

11:53.833 --> 11:55.167
You know what that
looks like to me?

11:55.167 --> 11:57.133
"Cauliflower with tits."

11:57.133 --> 11:58.500
It loo --

12:01.467 --> 12:03.433
That, to me,
right there...

12:03.433 --> 12:05.533
Murr: Come on, bud,
you can do it.

12:05.533 --> 12:08.800
It looks like a cauliflower,
but, like, you know, with tits.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.900
Sure, if you look
on this side,

12:12.900 --> 12:14.333
I see Europe.
But if you look on that side,

12:14.333 --> 12:17.367
I see, like,
a cauliflower with tits.

12:17.367 --> 12:18.800
Do you see it?

12:20.200 --> 12:22.367
Okay. Have a great day.
It was nice meeting you.

12:24.933 --> 12:27.200
-Oh, here we go.
-I should've brought sunglasses.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.167
Yeah, right?

12:28.167 --> 12:29.367
I love watching
the clouds.

12:29.367 --> 12:30.800
That's a huge one
over there.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.500
What I see
in that is, um...

12:32.500 --> 12:34.100
"That looks just like
an old couple

12:34.100 --> 12:35.667
sitting silently
at a dinner table

12:35.667 --> 12:36.867
just waiting
to die already."

12:39.367 --> 12:41.100
...an old couple
sitting silently at, like,

12:41.100 --> 12:43.467
a dinner table just wait --
just waiting to die already.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.367
Yeah. Do you see it?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.867
No?

12:48.867 --> 12:50.233
-She doesn't see it.
-No!

12:50.233 --> 12:52.467
But you don't see
an elderly couple

12:52.467 --> 12:53.700
sitting in silence
at the dinner table

12:53.700 --> 12:55.067
just waiting
to die already?

12:57.133 --> 12:59.500
Not in the clouds.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.667
All right. Maybe I have
a little bit more

13:00.667 --> 13:02.200
of an inventive
imagination.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.467
"That one looks like
a duck."

13:06.267 --> 13:07.467
That looks like a duck.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.533
You see --
You see that one?

13:11.533 --> 13:12.600
Yep.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.167
You see the duck?
How do we score this?

13:14.167 --> 13:15.400
All right,
tiebreaker.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.700
All right, tiebreaker.
Tiebreaker.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.067
That looks like,
uh...

13:20.067 --> 13:21.633
That's an
interracial couple

13:21.633 --> 13:24.067
having trouble
at the drive-through.

13:24.067 --> 13:25.733
Yeah, sure. that looks like
an interracial couple

13:25.733 --> 13:27.567
having trouble
at the drive-through.

13:27.567 --> 13:28.733
Do you see that one?

13:29.967 --> 13:31.800
Murr: Oh!
You lose.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.867
That's fair.

13:36.967 --> 13:38.067
Can I ask you
a question?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.300
What does that cloud
look like to you?

13:39.300 --> 13:40.367
That one, right there.

13:40.367 --> 13:43.067
See, to me,
it clearly looks like...

13:43.067 --> 13:45.067
"I think it's Sigourney Weaver
pumping gas."

13:46.867 --> 13:48.833
...Sigourney Weaver
pumping gas.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.100
"No, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.567
Ah, maybe it's --
maybe it's Geena Davis."

13:51.567 --> 13:55.067
Wait, no, no, no. You know,
it's Geena Davis pumping gas.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.967
It's Geena Davis.
It's definitely diesel,
that's for sure, you know?

13:57.967 --> 14:00.067
She's on the far-right pump,
you can tell.

14:01.367 --> 14:02.900
Do you see it?

14:02.900 --> 14:04.500
You don't see it?
-She doesn't see it.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.733
You don't see
any part of it?

14:06.733 --> 14:10.767
Do you see Geena Davis?
Sigourney Weaver?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.133
Diesel?

14:12.133 --> 14:13.667
Do you see a
damn cloud?

14:15.067 --> 14:16.367
"You got five bucks
I can borrow?"

14:16.367 --> 14:18.500
You got five bucks
I can borrow

14:18.500 --> 14:20.600
Hey, take it sleazy.

14:24.567 --> 14:25.733
-Joe.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.100
Q: You know the point
of the game, right?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.433
-Yeah.
-Joe, there's no one
sitting next to you.

14:28.433 --> 14:29.600
I know, but it's too hot
to walk around.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.433
I'm just gonna make
somebody sit down.

14:31.433 --> 14:33.833
Hey, yo.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.967
Come here. Yep.
Check it.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.300
Hey, yo, check it.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.233
I've been looking
at these clouds all day.

14:40.233 --> 14:42.600
Yeah, you see that cloud?
Doesn't that look like...

14:42.600 --> 14:45.300
"A leprechaun buying
prescription condoms."

14:45.300 --> 14:48.100
It
just like

14:48.100 --> 14:51.467
It looks like a leprechaun
buying prescription condoms.

14:51.467 --> 14:53.567
"For his former best friend
from college."

14:53.567 --> 14:56.367
For his former best
friend from college.

14:56.367 --> 14:57.400
-Yeah, do you --

14:57.400 --> 14:58.800
You see it,
right there?

14:58.800 --> 15:01.333
Check it, so, like,
right here...

15:01.333 --> 15:02.533
Check it.

15:02.533 --> 15:03.833
Yeah, you see it?

15:03.833 --> 15:05.433
Yeah.

15:05.433 --> 15:06.667
What

15:06.667 --> 15:08.067
Wait, what?
-Yeah, yeah, man.

15:08.067 --> 15:10.067
That's how we do.
That's a win.

15:10.067 --> 15:12.633
Good. See you later, man.
Great, bud.

15:12.633 --> 15:14.367
They're not friends anymore.
That's his fo--

15:14.367 --> 15:15.800
Come here. Check it.
Come here.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.467
You see this?
Come here.

15:18.467 --> 15:20.467
Not only can he call someone
over, he can call them back.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.567
So, let me ask you,
what's the probability

15:22.567 --> 15:24.800
that there's a cloud that
looks like a leprechaun

15:24.800 --> 15:26.267
who's buying
prescription condoms

15:26.267 --> 15:28.233
for his former best
friend from college?

15:28.233 --> 15:31.633
My friend,
I have the friend --

15:31.633 --> 15:34.567
a friend -- uh, a student --
Master of Mathematics...

15:34.567 --> 15:36.667
Sal: Oh, Joe's
regretting this.

15:36.667 --> 15:39.300
There's a look of regret
on Joe's face.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.967
Something tells me he's
not gonna call him
back a third time.

15:50.967 --> 15:52.167
I already won.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.267
All right. I'll talk
to you about it later.

15:58.267 --> 15:59.833
I can't get those minutes
of my life back.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.867
-We're bringing him in.
-No, come here.

16:01.867 --> 16:03.167
-Hello.
-Hello.

16:03.167 --> 16:04.700
We're filming a TV show.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.267
-Oh.
-He was on TV.

16:06.267 --> 16:07.633
Q: You were just
talking to Joe.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.633
Don't get him started.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.833
That's great. Thank you
for being part of the show.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.633
-Yes. I love the art.
-Yeah.

16:14.633 --> 16:16.700
-Yeah.
-It's the musical.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.067
I like being...

16:18.067 --> 16:20.433
Yeah.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.967
Narrator: Joe kept his head
out of the clouds,

16:24.967 --> 16:28.633
making Q
tonight's big loser.

16:28.633 --> 16:30.133
Q's our loser!

16:30.133 --> 16:32.100
So, today, we are here
in the lovely Dover,

16:32.100 --> 16:34.300
New Jersey's, town square
for Q's punishment.

16:34.300 --> 16:37.067
And Q is the artist
that's about to reveal

16:37.067 --> 16:39.767
the new town mural
that he painted.

16:39.767 --> 16:41.133
I painted?

16:41.133 --> 16:43.067
Meaning he's never seen it
and we had it done for him.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.867
I have a feeling that this is
gonna be the last mural

16:44.867 --> 16:47.067
that Dover allows.

16:47.067 --> 16:49.533
Murr: These are the proud
residents of Dover, New Jersey.

16:49.533 --> 16:52.300
About to meet the very un-proud
friend of ours, Brian Quinn.

16:52.300 --> 16:55.867
W-What am I -- What am I,
a painter with brain damage?

16:55.867 --> 16:58.333
I-I-I got paint everywhere
but the brush?

17:00.433 --> 17:02.867
I look like I cleaned
the porn booths in Munchkinland.

17:04.633 --> 17:08.100
Sal: So, the mayor of Dover
is our inside man in this.

17:08.100 --> 17:10.700
He gave us access
to make the mural,

17:10.700 --> 17:12.233
but he hasn't
seen it yet.

17:12.233 --> 17:13.767
Joe: He invited everybody
in the town.

17:13.767 --> 17:17.133
Murr: The whole board
of the city is here, Q.

17:17.133 --> 17:20.600
Oh, my God.
There's so many people!

17:20.600 --> 17:22.667
The mayor's
about to speak.

17:22.667 --> 17:26.933
All right. I just want to thank
everybody for coming out today.

17:26.933 --> 17:29.400
Today is our first
Arts in the Park day.

17:32.933 --> 17:34.933
Now, I'm gonna turn it
over to the artist

17:34.933 --> 17:38.800
who created this beautiful mural
for our town, Brian Quinn.

17:41.267 --> 17:43.267
-There he is.
-Hello, hi, hello.

17:43.267 --> 17:45.433
Hi, Dover.

17:45.433 --> 17:47.767
Mayor Dodd.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.167
Thank you.

17:49.167 --> 17:52.633
Talk about how, uh,
you got your inspiration.

17:52.633 --> 17:54.133
Uh...

17:54.133 --> 17:56.067
I spent a lot of time
here in Dover.

17:56.067 --> 17:59.400
I would come here during the
weeks and just take in the town.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.700
I went to, uh, you know,
your local shops,

18:02.700 --> 18:05.867
really got a feel for what
this place is about.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.633
Everybody really opened
their arms to me,

18:08.633 --> 18:11.433
and as such, I poured my heart
and soul into this.

18:12.433 --> 18:14.800
Thank you.
You people deserve it.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.267
Sal: Q, this is your
Sistine Chapel, baby.

18:17.267 --> 18:18.933
This is your
Mona Lisa.

18:18.933 --> 18:22.067
Three, two, one!

18:24.733 --> 18:26.267
Joe: Oh, my --

18:26.267 --> 18:27.600
Murr: Oh, my God!

18:33.333 --> 18:36.667
Wow, that's, uh...

18:36.667 --> 18:39.767
The mayor, who was nice enough
to let us come here,

18:39.767 --> 18:43.100
we didn't tell him what was
gonna be on the mural, either.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.933
And I'm not sure

18:44.933 --> 18:47.633
if he is regretting
his decision, at this point.

18:50.067 --> 18:51.333
Q: All right, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.100
I-I-I see some of you
aren't getting it.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.933
Ar-Ar-Art is subjective.
That's a cute baby.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.400
Look, I could've
came here,

18:59.400 --> 19:01.833
and I could've drawn,
like, George Washington

19:01.833 --> 19:04.633
riding a unicorn
holding an American flag,

19:04.633 --> 19:06.867
and you all would've
applauded me and loved me.

19:06.867 --> 19:10.933
That's easy. That's not art.
Art makes you think, right?

19:10.933 --> 19:13.133
I mean, you guys saw
"Stranger Things," right?

19:13.133 --> 19:16.300
Great town, there's
monsters everywhere, man.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.867
I-It's irony.
You guys love irony, right?

19:21.100 --> 19:23.733
-Oh, my God, this guy is pissed.
-Don't be angry.

19:23.733 --> 19:26.067
It's okay.

19:26.067 --> 19:28.233
Did I put
a huge turd on it?

19:28.233 --> 19:29.933
Damn right I did.

19:29.933 --> 19:33.467
Damn right I did, and I'll
tell you why -- because...

19:33.467 --> 19:35.833
-There's no good reason.
-This is rough.

19:35.833 --> 19:37.367
If you look, that's not
even where Dover is.

19:37.367 --> 19:40.733
That's, like, where Red Bank
is, you know

19:40.733 --> 19:43.967
Boo, Red Bank, right?
-Red Stank, Red Stank.

19:43.967 --> 19:45.967
Red Stank!

19:45.967 --> 19:48.867
Sal: Oh, my God.

19:48.867 --> 19:51.400
In retrospect, I may have
taken a different approach.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.567
But you've got to admit,
the font's cool.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.933
"Thank you for the
$25,000, Mr. Mayor."

19:59.567 --> 20:03.000
$25,000.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.733
Mr. Mayor, I want to
thank you for the $25,000

20:05.733 --> 20:07.533
you paid me
to paint this.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.767
Thank you, Mayor. Good luck
on that -- that next term.

20:15.567 --> 20:18.433
Joe: Q, get out of there.
Get out of there!

20:28.633 --> 20:30.400
This guy just got
punished pretty bad.

20:30.400 --> 20:34.300
Uh, I feel bad for him,
but also the town of Dover.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.400
Kind of split. But you,
it's so good for you,

20:36.400 --> 20:37.933
'cause you get
a behind-the-scenes look

20:37.933 --> 20:39.667
of how it all happens and bonus
footage from tonight's episode.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.400
-I look like an idiot.
-Yeah.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.133
How much work went
into this mural?

20:44.133 --> 20:45.900
Uh, none at all.
It was really easy. Really?

20:45.900 --> 20:48.100
No, that's impossible.
A lot of work went into it.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.467
'Cause, number one,
we've been talking about doing

20:49.467 --> 20:51.700
this mural for, like,
two years.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.000
And we finally got the town
of Dover, New Jersey

20:54.000 --> 20:55.500
to let us do it.

20:55.500 --> 20:59.067
And literally, only the mayor
knows that we're filming today.

20:59.067 --> 21:02.100
We're going to see
the intro right now...

21:02.100 --> 21:03.267
and it's, like,
pouring rain.

21:03.267 --> 21:04.600
This is, like, really
hard for production.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.100
David: We painted the mural
in the rain.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.767
They were holding tarps up
till, like, 3:00 this morning

21:08.767 --> 21:10.700
over the people painting
on the wall

21:10.700 --> 21:12.600
and water was falling
the whole time.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.933
So, the paint's still wet,
'cause it can't dry.

21:14.933 --> 21:18.400
-Three, two, one...
-Q's our loser!

21:18.400 --> 21:20.400
So, today, we are here
in the lovely Dover,

21:20.400 --> 21:22.767
New Jersey's, town square
for Q's punishment.

21:22.767 --> 21:25.100
Is this going to be permanently
on display after today,

21:25.100 --> 21:26.333
or is this removable?

21:26.333 --> 21:27.967
It's up to
the town of Dover.

21:27.967 --> 21:29.233
My -- My --

21:29.233 --> 21:32.067
My instincts tells me
they're gonna run up to it

21:32.067 --> 21:34.767
and immediately start
painting over it.

21:34.767 --> 21:36.333
-Cut.
-Wait, wait, wait,

21:36.333 --> 21:38.267
what's going on here?
-You know what's
going on, Casey.

21:38.267 --> 21:40.433
I don't wear this
when we're done filming.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.067
Take it away.
And I still -- Smell it.

21:43.067 --> 21:44.067
-Ew.
-Right.

21:44.067 --> 21:45.800
it smells like Murr.

21:46.967 --> 21:48.533
Joe: These people were
waiting in the rain

21:48.533 --> 21:49.933
for hours
to see this mural.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.667
The goal is to get the people
of Dover upset at Q...

21:52.667 --> 21:54.400
-Yes, that's right.
-...specifically.

21:56.133 --> 21:57.733
Oh, my God!

21:57.733 --> 21:58.967
Oh, my God!

22:00.800 --> 22:02.600
He's angry,
but you shouldn't be.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.967
I'm an artist, man, a-and my job
is to make you think,

22:05.967 --> 22:09.167
not to give you
easily digestible images

22:09.167 --> 22:11.533
that already reinforce
what you already know.

22:11.533 --> 22:13.267
Did I put a huge turd
on it?

22:13.267 --> 22:14.567
Damn right I did!

22:16.700 --> 22:18.867
I've never seen you, like, kind
of, like, stutter so much...

22:18.867 --> 22:20.933
No, th-that was -- That was
probably the worst that I've --

22:20.933 --> 22:24.600
that I've been in a while.
A-A-A-Art, it's subjective.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.633
That's a cute baby.

22:27.267 --> 22:30.433
You're gonna drive past this
every day of your life,

22:30.433 --> 22:31.767
and you're
gonna be thinking,

22:31.767 --> 22:33.700
"You know what?
Maybe Dover does suck

22:33.700 --> 22:35.067
just a little bit,"
right, Mayor?

22:35.067 --> 22:36.100
He knows.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.367
How much did you
know beforehand?

22:41.367 --> 22:43.600
Uh, I did not know
what it was gonna say.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.567
I-I didn't know what was
gonna be on the wall.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.067
Um... you know,
I agreed to it.

22:47.067 --> 22:49.200
I was hoping it wasn't
gonna be too bad.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.133
In any event, um, you know,
I think it's great

22:51.133 --> 22:52.533
for the exposure
for the town of Dover...

22:52.533 --> 22:54.067
to be on
"Impractical Jokers."

22:54.067 --> 22:55.200
I love the idea.
-That's true.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.533
I love the concept.
I mean, these guys are awesome.

22:57.533 --> 22:59.800
They do a great job, so we're
proud to have you guys here.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.433
Woman:
Three, two, one...

23:01.433 --> 23:03.167
Casey: So, now, the Jokers
are doing a group photo

23:03.167 --> 23:04.333
with the entire town.

23:04.333 --> 23:06.067
The town is not
ripping them apart.

23:06.067 --> 23:07.067
How great is that?

23:07.067 --> 23:08.767
-Here we go, guys.
-Here we go.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.967
-All right.
-Here we go!

23:16.433 --> 23:17.767
Oh, yeah, it's fine.

23:17.767 --> 23:19.833
Oh, look at that cloud.
You guys see that cloud?

23:21.067 --> 23:23.067
-Oh, okay.

23:23.067 --> 23:25.067
Can I pass
an idea to you?

23:25.067 --> 23:27.200
-Yeah, go ahead.
-So, I'm a pole dancer,

23:27.200 --> 23:29.067
and I think
a good punishment for Joe

23:29.067 --> 23:31.167
would be taking
a pole-dancing class.

23:31.167 --> 23:32.267
Yeah

23:32.267 --> 23:34.833
'Cause he's awful
at physical things.

23:34.833 --> 23:36.433
Oh,  this bitch.

23:36.433 --> 23:37.833
You realize that, uh,

23:37.833 --> 23:39.067
when you're speaking to this
thing, people can hear you.

23:39.067 --> 23:41.133
Hi, guys. Hi.

23:41.133 --> 23:42.867
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
-Uh-oh.

23:42.867 --> 23:45.067
Jump right on the pole
and you show her up.

23:46.833 --> 23:48.100
Watch this .

23:50.500 --> 23:52.067
I just ripped all my shorts
on that jump.
