WEBVTT

00:06.757 --> 00:08.463
One Ziggy, for good luck.

00:08.551 --> 00:11.258
One battle axe, good condition, right?

00:11.345 --> 00:14.758
Got one dagger, broken tip.

00:14.849 --> 00:19.639
One set of brass knuckles.
Keeping it real, you know.

00:19.729 --> 00:22.141
A bull whip. No comment.

00:22.231 --> 00:25.894
And one crazy curvy thing with--

00:25.985 --> 00:27.270
Ew, what is that?

00:27.361 --> 00:29.693
Tro|| blood.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.908
All of these weapons and not one of them
will do us any good against the Garuda.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.983
--Bo, don't worry--
--Kenzi, I am serious.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.068
You have seen how powerful he is.

00:37.163 --> 00:39.404
Even if Lauren can save
Lachlan's venom,

00:39.498 --> 00:42.114
I don't know if I can get close
enough to him to deliver it.

00:42.210 --> 00:47.125
Bo, I want to help you, I do.
ljust... I don't know how.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.214
Ow! That is not exactly
what I had in mind.

00:54.305 --> 00:55.511
Bo, that wasn't me.

00:55.598 --> 00:58.431
Oh! Son of a--

00:58.517 --> 01:00.132
Vex!

01:02.230 --> 01:03.936
I'm sorry. Am I disturbing you?

01:04.023 --> 01:06.355
Oh, wait, it's the other way 'round.

01:06.442 --> 01:09.684
What part of "you're a guest here"
do you not understand?

01:09.779 --> 01:12.612
The part that allows me
a peaceful night's sleep.

01:12.698 --> 01:16.190
I mean, it's bad enough I'm stuck in
this butcher's block you call a couch.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.948
But having to listen to you two
whine about the bloody Garuda.

01:20.039 --> 01:23.452
"Oh, what shall we do?
He's so mean and unstoppable."

01:23.542 --> 01:24.497
Nobody said that.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.076
Well, he is.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.753
Still, it's enough to make me
want to cut my own ears off.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.001
Well, let me save you the trouble.

01:32.093 --> 01:36.837
Careful, darling, you might
do something that you regret.

01:37.473 --> 01:38.929
No.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.972
Oh, Ziggy.

01:44.063 --> 01:47.305
Maybe you would get a more peaceful
night's sleep back in the Morrigan's prison.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.518
Fine. It's your party.
You can whine if you want to.

01:51.612 --> 01:56.106
I'll be here, trying not to think about
what's left behind on a succubus's couch.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.440
Hey!

01:57.535 --> 02:01.119
[cell phone ringing]

02:01.205 --> 02:02.661
Trick. Hey, what's up?

02:02.748 --> 02:05.911
Sorry for calling so late.

02:06.002 --> 02:08.584
l was hoping you could
come and see me at the Dal.

02:08.671 --> 02:10.627
I need to talk to you about something.

02:10.715 --> 02:15.926
And, Bo, bring the cane sword
I gave to you for your birthday.

02:31.110 --> 02:32.316
What's all this?

02:32.403 --> 02:35.019
Dispatches from a few hours ago.

02:35.114 --> 02:37.321
Evidence that the
Garuda has resurfaced.

02:37.408 --> 02:43.369
Let me guess, trail of dead and
a lingering scent of burnt chicken?

02:43.456 --> 02:46.573
I've been trying to pinpoint
his location and I'm getting close.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.876
That's why I called you here.
I'm concerned about your plan.

02:50.963 --> 02:51.998
You and me both.

02:52.089 --> 02:55.126
This extra power you're going
to be taking on is dangerous.

02:55.217 --> 02:59.711
You could lose yourself
to the darkness within you.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.966
And you may never make it back.

03:02.058 --> 03:05.221
That's a risk I have to take if I have
any chance of defeating the Garuda.

03:05.311 --> 03:07.051
I know.

03:08.481 --> 03:10.346
May |?

03:12.068 --> 03:14.400
This belonged to lsabeau.

03:14.487 --> 03:16.273
I inherited my grandmother's name?

03:16.364 --> 03:19.697
And much more.
I want you to have this.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.281
Her life essence.

03:37.635 --> 03:41.048
The liquid can cure illness,
neutralize poison,

03:41.138 --> 03:43.800
it can even stave off
the darkness from within.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.382
It has incredible curative powers.

03:46.477 --> 03:50.265
It's where you got your ability to heal.

03:50.356 --> 03:54.770
l've hid it for years, waiting for
that right time to use it.

03:54.860 --> 03:58.728
And I think that time
is quickly approaching.

04:01.534 --> 04:08.952
We survive this, I want to hear
all about her. About everyone.

04:09.041 --> 04:14.957
Keep this safe. And if you feel
the darkness taking hold, drink it.

04:15.047 --> 04:18.960
lt'll restore you to the Bo we love.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.257
I don't know what I'd do without you.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.805
Me too.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.268
Someone up there?

04:28.352 --> 04:30.388
The bar is closed for the night.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.674
Trick!

05:04.054 --> 05:05.510
Trick!

05:11.520 --> 05:14.432
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

05:14.523 --> 05:17.435
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.438
My love carries a death sentence.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.611
l was lost for years,

05:22.698 --> 05:25.360
searching, while hiding,

05:25.451 --> 05:29.615
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

05:29.705 --> 05:34.574
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

05:40.925 --> 05:43.917
I'm guessing they were Rabisu.
Underfae that hide in the shadows.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.967
Looks like the Garuda's
got friends in low places.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.262
Well, whatever they were,
they got Trick.

05:48.349 --> 05:52.683
I checked the abattoir.
No sign of the Garuda.

05:52.770 --> 05:56.388
Okay. Well, Trick says he was close
to figuring out the Garuda's location.

05:56.482 --> 05:59.269
There are stacks of maps
and papers in the lair.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.021
I got a D in geography, babe.

06:01.111 --> 06:04.023
Kenzi, this is important.
We have to find Trick fast.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.775
[HALE] Okay. Come on.
I'll give you a hand.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.403
Well, what's so important
about Trick, anyway?

06:08.494 --> 06:12.362
Yes, he lets you drink for free, but it's
hardly worth you putting your lives,

06:12.456 --> 06:16.165
and more importantly,
my life on the line.

06:16.252 --> 06:18.664
Trick is Architect of the Peace.

06:21.298 --> 06:25.007
You trying to tell me
that imp is the Blood King?

06:29.807 --> 06:32.298
I never touched this.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.258
Now you know why
finding him is so important.

06:34.353 --> 06:37.060
And why we're the only
ones who can pull it off.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.765
Blimey, we really are buggered.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.942
I'm going to go talk to Lauren,
okay, bring her up to speed.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.282
What language is this?

06:51.370 --> 06:56.660
It's like a cross between hieroglyphics
and a doctor's prescription pad.

06:56.750 --> 07:01.995
Okay. I am going to make a list
of marks and then look for patterns.

07:02.089 --> 07:06.207
So, we got a sideways house,

07:06.302 --> 07:09.840
pair of broken glasses,

07:09.930 --> 07:12.842
and a skinny guy lifting
weights at the beach.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.595
Uh, you think this is the most
efficient way of doing this?

07:15.686 --> 07:18.644
Please, I was queen of
codes at Greenside High.

07:18.731 --> 07:23.270
| invented my own language
for passing cheat sheets.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.975
Course you did.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.485
ac ansvenom.
L hl '

07:30.576 --> 07:32.988
Well, what I was able to salvage.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.614
How many doses is this?

07:34.705 --> 07:39.199
One. The other samples
were just too degraded.

07:39.293 --> 07:43.002
Talk about putting all
your eggs in one basket.

07:43.088 --> 07:43.952
Sorry.

07:44.048 --> 07:48.542
You're the only person in, like, a thousand
years who managed to even get this.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.718
Bo...

07:50.804 --> 07:53.546
You promise me one thing.

07:53.641 --> 07:57.179
You make the Garuda suffer.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.136
He has my grandfather.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.266
And the things that he could
make the Blood King do--

08:02.358 --> 08:04.770
Do you know how powerful Trick is?

08:04.860 --> 08:08.102
Almost as powerful as you.

08:08.197 --> 08:13.237
You have faith in yourself, in your heart.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.943
It's not my heart I'm worried about.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.996
I love you...

08:21.752 --> 08:27.042
...all... so much.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.464
Then be what we need.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.634
A leader.

08:49.363 --> 08:52.070
--Hey, how's it going down there?
--Not great.

08:52.157 --> 08:57.026
Do you have any fancy Siren moves
for a sore neck? Please say you do.

08:57.121 --> 08:58.281
How about the old-fashioned way?

08:58.372 --> 09:00.203
Ah, thank you.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.076
No problem.

09:02.167 --> 09:06.627
Ohhh... god.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.955
Oh, go ahead and merge
naughty bits already.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.382
I mean, seriously, am | the
only one seeing this?

09:13.846 --> 09:16.007
[BO] Good. You're all here.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.805
I want to talk about my plan.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.474
Thank you.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.348
The last time we went after the Garuda,

09:23.439 --> 09:25.521
he manipulated us into
fighting with each other.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.518
Dude was like a Fae Jerry Springer.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.736
But I have an answer to that.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.481
My blood.

09:31.572 --> 09:32.687
No me comprende.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.772
My blood has a unique quality.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.825
You saw it with Ryan. He became mine.

09:37.911 --> 09:42.075
Okay, oh, whoa, whoa. You... what,
you want to enslave us?

09:42.166 --> 09:45.329
I want to unite us in one common goal.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.661
Eliminate individual
doubts and conflicts.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.962
It is our only hope.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.790
Hang on a minute.
You want to put that in here?

09:52.885 --> 09:55.968
I mean, no offence, darling,
but I don't know where you've been.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.260
Nowhere worse than you.

09:57.347 --> 10:01.386
Oh, yeah? Well, at least I draw
the line at sleeping with dogs.

10:01.477 --> 10:05.265
Stop it! This is exactly
what I am talking about.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.846
We need to put aside our differences

10:07.941 --> 10:11.559
if we want to get close enough to
the Garuda to deliver the Naga venom.

10:19.369 --> 10:23.282
[THE GARUDA] Ah, my package has arrived.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.034
You're released.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.871
You're wasting your time.

10:33.425 --> 10:36.212
You can't force me to rewrite the laws.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.170
You've got it all wrong, Blood King.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.301
l have no intention of
forcing you to do anything.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.428
Planning to beg?

10:47.606 --> 10:52.145
Before the day is through,
you'll be the one begging.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.374
My castle at Edenderry?

11:09.461 --> 11:13.170
Where you took your final stand
during the Great Fae War.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.385
What sort of trick is this?

11:20.472 --> 11:24.932
No trick. Well, actually, two Tricks.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.102
What is the point of this charade?

11:36.196 --> 11:40.656
You say you acted in the best interest of
the Fae to use your blood to end the war.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.528
I'm here to prove you wrong.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.484
With another manufactured
hallucination?

11:44.580 --> 11:46.445
With the truth.

11:46.540 --> 11:52.126
If you're so convinced you acted nobly,
what's the harm of reviewing the decision?

11:54.631 --> 11:55.416
My liege.

11:55.507 --> 11:59.125
Alastor. How goes the war?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.084
I bring grim news.

12:01.179 --> 12:04.922
The forces of Lady Almaith have
defeated our armies at Rosecrea.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.178
Damn that Almaith!

12:07.269 --> 12:09.351
She's making a fool of me.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.349
Her success has been remarkable.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.352
But our armies are
amassing at Portlaoise

12:14.443 --> 12:17.401
to intercept her and
that Dark viper, Horvis.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.695
If we prevail there,
we turn the tide of war.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.910
A man of your greatness
deserves victory.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.741
That bootlicking mole
was my war chancellor.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.951
He was feeding information to Almaith.

12:34.046 --> 12:36.833
| banished him to the
underworld because of it.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.130
l was so blind.

12:38.216 --> 12:42.880
And yet, your true
blindness is still to come.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.550
How's it going?

12:49.645 --> 12:56.892
So far, I've figured out that the broken
dog bone is a T. Or an L, or both.

12:56.985 --> 13:00.352
We need to talk. It's important.

13:00.447 --> 13:04.065
Lauren's upstairs injecting
the others with my blood.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.399
That's good, right?

13:05.494 --> 13:08.076
Trick warned me that binding
so many other people to me

13:08.163 --> 13:10.745
could cause me to change.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.572
To turn Dark like my mother.

13:12.668 --> 13:16.377
--Long as you don't turn bee-otch.
--Kenzi!

13:16.463 --> 13:17.543
Are you listening?

13:17.631 --> 13:20.293
Yes. Yes, I am.

13:20.384 --> 13:25.094
If you see me start to lose it,
you need to unbind the others right away.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.761
No prob. Trick showed
me the shortcut.

13:26.848 --> 13:30.340
All I need to do is cut one of them,
wrap the wound in gossamer.

13:30.435 --> 13:36.977
If that doesn't work, you need to be
prepared to do whatever is necessary.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.774
You're freaking me out.

13:39.861 --> 13:45.356
Oh, Kenz, if you can't break the bond...

13:45.450 --> 13:47.736
...you need to kill me.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.202
Yeah, right.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.709
You're serious.

14:01.800 --> 14:07.386
We both know what could happen if
I go too far and I cannot live like that.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.088
Bo, nothing is going to happen.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.596
--But what if it does?
--It is not!

14:13.687 --> 14:16.599
Okay?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.976
Don't ask me to do this.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.900
You are the only one
I can trust with this.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.570
You are my best friend.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.441
Promise me.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.821
Promise me!

14:39.588 --> 14:41.328
I promise.

14:45.427 --> 14:48.385
You'll start to develop feelings for Bo.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.885
You'll want to protect her at all costs.

14:51.975 --> 14:55.593
Is that going to be a problem for you?

14:55.687 --> 14:58.474
Dyson .

14:58.565 --> 15:01.477
No. I'm good.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.664
Welcome to Team Bo, again.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.333
Well, I guess that just leaves you.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.008
Must we?

15:36.603 --> 15:37.843
How's it going up here?

15:37.938 --> 15:41.601
So far, so good. I'm just
administering the last shot now.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.943
No! Oh.

15:44.027 --> 15:48.020
Oh, for crying out loud.
I haven't got all day.

15:49.324 --> 15:52.566
Ah! Sharpen the tips next time.

15:52.661 --> 15:56.153
Or don't they teach you that
in remedial medical school?

16:10.512 --> 16:12.252
lsabeau.

16:21.356 --> 16:25.065
Alastor told me about
Rosecrea. I'm sorry.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.768
This war will be the death of me.

16:30.699 --> 16:35.693
Perhaps I should just end it
once and for all with my blood.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.903
Don't even contemplate that.

16:37.998 --> 16:41.661
You know writing laws in your blood
carries unforeseen consequences.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.625
There's another option.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.708
I've sent word to Horvis,
leader of the Dark army.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.178
We discussed this.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.423
You know of our families'
past friendship.

16:54.514 --> 16:59.304
I'm certain I can convince him to return
with me here, to broker a peace with you.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.680
l strictly forbid it.

17:01.771 --> 17:05.229
Horvis cannot be trusted.

17:05.317 --> 17:08.024
Do you understand me?

17:12.115 --> 17:15.607
But lsabeau went anyway, didn't she?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.569
Yes, she did.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.082
[knocking]

17:37.224 --> 17:39.089
Hey, Dyson.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.472
Bo, sleep with me.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.979
--What?
--You need the strength for the battle

17:50.070 --> 17:51.526
and I can give it to you.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.523
Oh.

17:52.614 --> 17:56.823
As much as you need.
As much as you want.

17:56.910 --> 18:01.995
Dyson, I can't. It will confuse things.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.119
My mind is perfectly clear.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.075
lt's clearer than it's been
in a long time.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.627
It's the blood talking.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.831
I am not going to take
advantage of that...

18:14.344 --> 18:17.131
...as much as I would love to.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.763
I did it!

18:20.850 --> 18:22.806
The broken dog bone was an F.

18:22.894 --> 18:23.974
What are you talking about?

18:29.943 --> 18:32.525
It's an abandoned asylum
for the criminally insane.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.523
The place is huge.
Trick could be anywhere.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.071
I think that the Garuda
is keeping Trick here.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.944
lt's easily guarded with limited access.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.321
Oh, I get it. It's a death trap.

18:41.413 --> 18:44.246
If the Garuda's victorious,
you'll be lucky you died early.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.039
We'll split into teams,
try and draw the enemy apart.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.164
We need to get as far in as we can
without sounding the alarm.

18:50.255 --> 18:54.294
You really think we can take down an
entire facility, I mean, just the six of us.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.090
[VAL] You mean seven.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.260
Val?

18:59.347 --> 19:01.804
Baba Yaga wasn't available?

19:03.643 --> 19:08.262
I brought gifts, courtesy
of the Santiago family vault.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.974
These weapons have seen my family
through countless victories.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.275
Sweet. Daddy-o came through, huh?

19:14.362 --> 19:15.772
Thank you.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.025
Hey, come here.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.231
What are you doing here, Val?

19:19.326 --> 19:21.692
You're supposed to be
at the stronghold. Where--

19:30.378 --> 19:31.834
Done?

19:36.092 --> 19:38.674
I'm going with you and that's that.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.218
I can be very useful.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.670
Stealing voices?

19:41.765 --> 19:44.632
Have you forgotten
my skill with a sword?

19:44.726 --> 19:47.763
Three time finalist at
the Light Fae Invitational.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.642
Fine. Go see the doc about some blood.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.102
I want you all to know
how much it means to me

19:57.197 --> 20:00.109
that you're willing to fight by my side,

20:00.200 --> 20:02.907
for all sides.

20:02.994 --> 20:06.361
I know that we have
lost friends in this battle.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.868
And there is no guarantee
we'll make it out alive.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.164
This is supposed to be motivating?

20:10.251 --> 20:16.087
But if we pull together,
we can defeat the Garuda.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.129
lt's dangerous...

20:22.097 --> 20:25.305
...but we have to do this.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.259
And we cannot fail.

20:28.353 --> 20:33.063
Bo, we are all one hundred
percent behind you.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.559
Bo's the best!

20:34.651 --> 20:36.232
It's okay.

20:38.029 --> 20:41.442
Blood seems to be working.

20:41.533 --> 20:44.491
Then let's go kick some eagle ass.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.039
[HALE] You feel that?

20:56.089 --> 20:58.125
[KENZI] Yeah. It's flat-out
creepy in here.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.047
[VEX] Oh, no weapon, eh, Dyson?

21:00.135 --> 21:02.217
Trying to hang with the big boys?

21:02.303 --> 21:04.589
[DYSON] Let's see who's standing
at the end of the day, Vex.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.046
Save it for the big show.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.756
Yeah? Well, why don't we put on a show

21:07.851 --> 21:09.341
--right now?
--Hey! You touch her, you die.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.472
--Stop this.
--Guys, it's the Garuda.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.552
He's doing this again.

21:12.647 --> 21:15.013
Your blood may not be enough to
counteract the Garuda's influence.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.644
That's why we need to stay focused.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.476
Dyson, Vex, Hale, you're with Val.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.937
Lauren and Kenzi, with me. Come on.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.532
So, you and Bo, huh?

21:33.626 --> 21:37.744
You know, I've always wondered what
it would be like to tap that succu-butt.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.454
Shut up and keep moving.

21:39.549 --> 21:42.791
Oh, come on, just a little taste.

21:42.886 --> 21:44.751
You know I'll never have the pleasure.

21:44.846 --> 21:49.215
Unless, of course, you invite me
to join you sometime.

21:51.144 --> 21:55.433
[KENZI] Are we going in circles?
'Cause all these hallways look the same.

21:55.523 --> 21:58.310
[BO] It's no surprise
he picked this place.

21:58.401 --> 22:02.895
All the pain and misery.
It's a Garuda buffet.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.945
[LAUREN] Bo, how are you feeling?

22:05.033 --> 22:07.024
Fine. You don't have to keep
asking me every five minutes.

22:07.118 --> 22:07.982
Actually, I do.

22:08.077 --> 22:11.569
| feel the same as always,
which doesn't make any sense.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.121
Ladies, we've got company.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.665
I got this.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.888
Bo!

22:46.407 --> 22:47.863
Thanks.

22:50.578 --> 22:51.363
l'll handle this.

22:51.412 --> 22:54.119
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can fight my own battles.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.671
See, lover boy? I told you.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.221
Vex!

23:16.312 --> 23:18.348
Oh, my arm!

23:18.439 --> 23:19.599
Come on, Vex, we got to move.

23:19.691 --> 23:20.771
Are you having a laugh?

23:20.858 --> 23:22.644
Get up!

23:36.916 --> 23:38.622
Sorry.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.450
We ran into some trouble.

23:40.545 --> 23:43.002
What?

23:43.089 --> 23:44.625
What happened?

23:46.843 --> 23:51.257
He has a bad break. In fact, several.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.087
He could go into shock.
I have to stay with him.

23:53.182 --> 23:56.470
--What? No!
--Bo, he can't travel. He needs care.

23:56.561 --> 23:58.517
We'll find a place to stay
until you get back.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.061
No. I'm not leaving you.

24:00.148 --> 24:04.391
Bo! Trick is still in danger.
You have to go.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.225
I'll be all right.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.250
Let's go.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.134
This is a mistake, m'lady.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.803
I've known Horvis since childhood.
I'll be perfectly safe.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.381
--But what do | tell the King?
--You may tell my husband

24:36.476 --> 24:38.137
that I'm losing him to this war.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.513
The man I love is becoming a man I fear.

24:40.605 --> 24:41.845
She feared me?

24:41.939 --> 24:44.191
They all feared you at
the end, Blood King.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.185
You would have me tell him--

24:45.276 --> 24:48.393
Nothing. He can't know
where I've gone.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.147
M'lady.

24:49.197 --> 24:51.062
You know the King's mood on this.

24:51.157 --> 24:54.115
If we don't find peace soon,
I fear the consequences.

24:54.202 --> 24:58.946
I'll keep your secret. I am,
as always, your faithful servant.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.282
A faithless coward is what he was.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.584
She was so brave.

25:06.381 --> 25:08.588
Why didn't I see that then?

25:08.675 --> 25:09.630
Show me no more of this.

25:09.717 --> 25:12.675
Ah, but you're missing the best part.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.522
What is he doing?

25:43.418 --> 25:46.706
What was in that dispatch?

25:46.796 --> 25:49.708
You really don't know,
do you, Blood King?

25:59.767 --> 26:01.348
[VAL] Back here again?

26:07.442 --> 26:10.354
Val!

26:10.445 --> 26:12.151
--Everything okay?
--You kidding me?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.695
It's better than Call of Duty 3!

26:19.704 --> 26:21.160
No, Kenzi!

26:23.499 --> 26:27.287
Kenzi. Hey, hey.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.747
|s-|s-|s it bad?

26:53.237 --> 26:55.444
Do you know how your wife died?

26:55.531 --> 26:59.240
She was killed by Lady Almaith's men
after assassins murdered Horvis.

26:59.327 --> 27:06.449
Actually, assassins killed both Horvis
and your wife under your sealed orders.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.624
The dispatch that Alastor sent.

27:08.711 --> 27:11.544
What your wife must have felt
when she saw the bandits

27:11.631 --> 27:16.000
bear down on her and realizing
she'd been betrayed.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.836
--[HORV|S] Hide, m'lady.
--[|SABEAU] Horvis!

27:19.931 --> 27:21.842
lsabeau!

27:21.933 --> 27:25.471
The slaying of Horvis under the King's
seal was a watershed moment.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.847
Both Light and Dark
condemned the action.

27:27.939 --> 27:30.100
Turned against you.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.102
Do you see it now?

27:32.193 --> 27:37.153
How you wrote the laws to enforce the
peace in order to save your own hide?

27:37.240 --> 27:40.653
Horvis's death would have
ignited centuries of conflict.

27:40.743 --> 27:44.281
No. Light and Dark were
united in their outrage.

27:44.372 --> 27:47.239
They would have danced
at your execution together.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.245
And with this, the conflict
would have been resolved.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.668
Instead, you chose to
hide behind your blood,

27:52.755 --> 27:55.542
like a child within the
folds of his mother's skirt.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.124
I didn't know!

27:58.219 --> 28:01.052
Now you can make it right.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.850
The ceasefire you created

28:04.934 --> 28:08.802
could implode at any moment
because it is based on a false premise.

28:08.896 --> 28:15.813
However, if you unwrite the laws
and allow fate to take its final course,

28:15.903 --> 28:21.114
a true and everlasting peace
will eventually take hold.

28:30.793 --> 28:33.705
Do it, Blood King.

28:33.796 --> 28:40.008
Before it's too late for your wife,
for your granddaughter.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.055
How are you doing?

28:47.143 --> 28:48.679
Oh, peachy, yeah.

28:48.769 --> 28:53.354
Lying down has relieved the pain
in my shattered arm completely.

28:53.441 --> 28:56.854
Hey, Doc, you got to help her.

28:56.944 --> 28:59.731
Oh, god. We need to get
them in there, but I can't.

29:05.494 --> 29:08.827
Do it, Blood King, do it now.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.535
Trick, stop!

29:16.631 --> 29:18.963
Finish it before it's too late.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.541
Don't. He's filling you with lies.

29:21.636 --> 29:23.092
I don't know what's true anymore.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.420
Then listen to me.

29:25.514 --> 29:30.929
Unwriting the laws will
cause nothing but pain.

29:31.020 --> 29:35.855
Deep down, Trick,
you know what is right.

29:39.195 --> 29:42.813
I made a mistake back then.

29:42.907 --> 29:45.819
But I won't make another one now.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.650
[shrieking]

29:47.745 --> 29:50.737
How dare you interfere with Garuda!

29:50.831 --> 29:54.369
Buddy, you really need to stop talking
about yourself in the third person.

30:01.175 --> 30:03.837
You are wasting your time.

30:03.928 --> 30:07.921
Without the Naga venom,
you cannot kill me.

30:10.267 --> 30:14.681
Bo, the wolf spirit told me the
Garuda would be most vulnerable

30:14.772 --> 30:15.932
when he thought he'd already won.

30:16.023 --> 30:18.935
What? No. No, Dyson, he'll kill you.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.891
Then it's meant to be.

30:41.882 --> 30:46.251
You can't hurt me. I'm all-powerful.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.087
First Lachlan, now the wolf.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.924
How many fools have
sacrificed themselves for you?

30:53.019 --> 30:57.683
You're no champion. You're just
a girl, too scared to pick a team.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.024
No.

30:59.108 --> 31:01.315
Allow me to choose for you.

31:01.402 --> 31:04.314
Join your friends in death.

31:14.915 --> 31:18.078
We got trouble. There's a group
of Berserkers headed this way.

31:18.169 --> 31:20.535
Hello. We've got to get out of here.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.881
I can't move her, Vex.
She'll bleed to death.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.045
Well, we're not leaving her.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.498
Or Bo.

31:34.268 --> 31:35.383
Oh, to hell with Bo.

31:35.478 --> 31:39.096
Her scheme got us into
this mess in the first place.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.976
How could you say that? Huh?

31:41.067 --> 31:43.729
Easy, Siren.

31:43.819 --> 31:44.899
Wait. He's right.

31:44.987 --> 31:48.070
If you were truly bound to Bo, that
thought wouldn't have crossed your mind.

31:48.157 --> 31:49.863
You didn't take the blood, did you, Vex?

31:49.950 --> 31:52.111
Listen, I didn't mean any harm, but--

31:52.203 --> 31:53.488
Take over. Apply pressure.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.160
But it's a bit mad, isn't it?

31:55.247 --> 31:57.078
The binding isn't whole.
There's a weak link in the chain.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.372
Give me your arm.

31:58.459 --> 32:01.371
Sorry, darling, but I'm still
not comfortable with that idea.

32:01.462 --> 32:02.326
Well, you better get comfortable,

32:02.421 --> 32:04.161
'cause I'm going to shove this
arm so far down your throat,

32:04.256 --> 32:05.996
you'll be mesmerizing
your own bowel movements.

32:06.092 --> 32:09.004
Ooh, when you put it like that...

32:19.063 --> 32:21.349
Now there's power.

32:33.536 --> 32:38.621
Oh, you're clever, cutting off
the turmoil that I feed on,

32:38.707 --> 32:40.868
but it won't help you now.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.871
I think it just did.

32:49.009 --> 32:50.965
How are you?

32:51.053 --> 32:53.760
Liking life. Loving that succubus.

32:53.848 --> 32:57.932
But it doesn't solve the problem of
the approaching hordes now, does it?

32:58.018 --> 33:00.100
Little mama, please.

33:00.187 --> 33:04.977
Fight. Fight. Come on, please.

33:05.067 --> 33:08.730
Hale, your--your voice.

33:08.821 --> 33:09.981
Yeah.

33:10.072 --> 33:13.610
Wait, your Siren whistle.

33:13.701 --> 33:17.535
Can you raise the frequency high
enough to cauterize her wound?

33:17.621 --> 33:19.122
I don't think that's a good idea.

33:19.206 --> 33:23.825
Hale, we have to do something.
If we don't, she's going to die.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.910
You have to try.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.795
Okay...

33:48.611 --> 33:53.571
[whistling]

34:03.959 --> 34:05.165
You're strong.

34:05.252 --> 34:09.336
But I have waited and starved
too long for this war!

34:09.423 --> 34:16.591
And the visions have made you weak,
allowing me to enter you, just like Nadia.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.671
What? No.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.183
No. No, no!

34:31.779 --> 34:33.360
That's it, brother.

34:41.997 --> 34:43.453
Kenzi?

34:44.750 --> 34:48.834
What happened?
Did I get roofied again?

34:48.921 --> 34:53.335
No, no, no. You're going to be just fine.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.802
You saved my life, didn't you?

34:55.886 --> 34:59.174
Listen, I don't want to interrupt
this Hallmark moment, but, uh...

34:59.265 --> 35:01.927
...we got to get a move Oh.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.633
Oh. I have to find Bo.

35:04.728 --> 35:07.720
No, no, no. Kenzi, we have
to get you out of here.

35:07.815 --> 35:11.433
No. It's important. I promised.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.185
Will you help me?

35:15.281 --> 35:18.273
[VAL] Easy. I got this.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.574
[KENZI] Is that my blood?

35:32.256 --> 35:33.712
Trick?

35:35.134 --> 35:38.126
Not here, I'm afraid.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.506
You son of a bitch.

35:43.267 --> 35:47.977
He had strong feelings for you,
his darling granddaughter.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.270
What happened? Where's--
where's the Garuda?

35:50.357 --> 35:51.733
He's inside of Trick!

35:51.817 --> 35:53.933
Well, what we waiting for?
Stab the little bugger!

35:54.028 --> 35:58.112
It won't do any good, it'll just kill
Trick the same way it did Nadia.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.575
She's a smart one.

36:00.659 --> 36:05.073
Now if you don't mind,
I have some laws to rewrite.

36:07.583 --> 36:10.825
Of my own free will.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.534
Oh, no you don't!

36:17.468 --> 36:21.928
Wait! The blood tests you ran
on Nadia, they showed Fae D.N.A.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.629
Because she was infected
by the Garuda, yes.

36:23.724 --> 36:26.807
Well, if the Garuda's D.N.A. is
inside of Trick, then maybe--

36:26.894 --> 36:29.180
The venom might work, but it could
end up killing them both.

36:29.271 --> 36:33.935
The Nain Rouge's prophecy, she showed
me a vision where I killed Trick.

36:34.026 --> 36:37.359
Ladies, I can't hold him off forever.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.652
What is that?

36:42.743 --> 36:46.702
Gift from Lachlan.
Leftover Naga venom.

36:56.006 --> 36:57.871
What have you done?

37:11.772 --> 37:15.060
[shrieking]

37:20.989 --> 37:23.651
Oh, Trick. Trick

37:23.742 --> 37:26.404
Trick. Trick, no.

37:26.495 --> 37:30.955
Trick, come back to me, please.
Trick, please come back to me.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.208
I'm so sorry.

37:42.302 --> 37:46.796
N --No!
- o, no, no!

37:51.311 --> 37:53.097
I should have killed the Garuda sooner.

37:53.188 --> 37:56.396
Him and every single
one of his minions.

37:56.483 --> 38:00.692
I will seek them out and kill them all and
anyone who tries to stand in my way.

38:00.779 --> 38:05.489
Bo! You're losing control.
Time for your meds, okay?

38:15.169 --> 38:16.124
[LAUREN] No, no, Bo!

38:16.211 --> 38:19.169
I know what I'm doing.

38:19.256 --> 38:25.422
Work! Please work.
Please, please, please!

38:31.935 --> 38:33.391
Trick!

38:37.232 --> 38:39.143
The Garuda?

38:39.234 --> 38:40.735
He's dead.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.483
What have you done?

38:46.575 --> 38:49.362
I couldn't lose you. I couldn't lose you.

38:49.453 --> 38:51.614
But you could lose yourself.
Unbind her quickly.

38:51.705 --> 38:54.572
You got it. Siren, hand.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.797
My strength is unmatched!

39:03.884 --> 39:09.629
I will reign as queen and you
shall all tremble before my power!

39:09.723 --> 39:12.430
Quickly, before the darkness
overwhelms her completely.

39:12.518 --> 39:17.262
With harm to none, thy will be done.
Thou cannot harm them, Bo.

39:19.942 --> 39:21.148
Bo! Bo!

39:21.235 --> 39:23.647
It's okay.

39:23.737 --> 39:25.568
That's a good sign.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.539
You're cleaning now?

39:37.626 --> 39:40.959
There's a party upstairs.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.583
I don't feel much like celebrating.

39:43.674 --> 39:48.043
Don't tell me you actually
believe what the Garuda said.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.388
Well, maybe he was right.

39:50.472 --> 39:53.805
Maybe the Light and the Dark
would have united over my death.

39:57.854 --> 40:02.188
A wise man once told me that
you can't put any stock in visions.

40:02.276 --> 40:05.734
I believe it was you.

40:05.821 --> 40:08.483
And yet, the Nain Rouge's
vision came true.

40:08.574 --> 40:12.738
Not entirely.
You're still here, aren't you?

40:16.707 --> 40:19.039
I need to make amends, Bo.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.915
And I will help you.

40:25.007 --> 40:27.419
That's what family's for.

40:32.055 --> 40:34.467
She was beautiful.

40:34.558 --> 40:36.139
Yes, she was.

40:37.978 --> 40:40.344
I miss her so much.

40:43.442 --> 40:48.732
Come on. Let me buy
you a beer, Grandpa.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.278
Come on.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.331
How you holding up?

40:58.415 --> 41:03.751
Oh, you know, stabbed, almost died,
stitched up with a Siren whistle.

41:03.837 --> 41:05.043
The ushe.

41:05.130 --> 41:05.915
Yeah.

41:06.006 --> 41:09.999
Yeah, just... I wish I could get
rid of this pain in my arm.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.055
--[HALE] Whoa.
--[KENZ|] What is that?

41:14.139 --> 41:15.640
I don't know.

41:15.724 --> 41:17.385
Did you come in contact
with something?

41:17.476 --> 41:20.468
You should definitely let
Doc take a look at that.

41:20.562 --> 41:25.807
No. No, I'm fine. I'm just
going to get some air, okay?

41:32.866 --> 41:35.733
All hail the champion.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.364
It was a team effort.

41:38.455 --> 41:41.071
It was a team led by you.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.202
Seriously, hasn't the binding worn off?

41:43.293 --> 41:44.954
Accept the compliments, kiddo.

41:45.045 --> 41:50.256
You know, I have to say, darling,
I'm very impressed with you.

41:50.342 --> 41:52.833
You didn't let me down nearly
half as much as I thought you would.

41:52.928 --> 41:56.261
Well, it turns out you were
the right man for the job, Vex.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.517
You know, it's going to take
them a while to select a new Ash.

42:02.604 --> 42:04.560
Now might be your best chance.

42:04.648 --> 42:06.058
To do what?

42:06.149 --> 42:09.266
Run. Be free.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.852
I know how much that means to you.

42:14.157 --> 42:16.614
Well, I appreciate you
looking out for me.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.332
You're going to have
a lot of fun with that.

42:38.682 --> 42:40.297
Hey, have you seen Kenzi?

42:40.392 --> 42:42.007
Yeah, she went out for some air.

42:42.102 --> 42:44.093
Is she okay?

42:44.187 --> 42:45.267
Uh...

42:45.355 --> 42:47.732
Here, hold my drink.
I'm gonna go check on her.

42:47.816 --> 42:49.352
All right.
