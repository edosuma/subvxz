I avoided the main arteries.
She'll live.

31:23.333 --> 31:25.289
If that's what you call this.

31:26.293 --> 31:31.811
Whatever's controlling the Beast,
it's made contact with Angelus.

31:33.853 --> 31:36.321
So what? Torturing humans
part of the new makeover?

31:36.493 --> 31:38.688
- Did what I had to because you couldn't.
- I hit her.

31:38.853 --> 31:41.526
- You think that's new to her?
- You crossed it back there.

31:41.693 --> 31:44.002
You have a problem
with a little torture now?

31:44.173 --> 31:46.368
I recall a time
when you rather enjoyed it.

31:47.013 --> 31:49.481
Yeah, well, it's not me anymore.
You know that.

31:49.813 --> 31:52.930
Nice to have this along, though.
Just in case.

31:54.933 --> 31:57.731
I remember what you did to me.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.803
The broken glass, the shallow cuts...

32:02.133 --> 32:04.772
...so I would remain conscious.

32:06.173 --> 32:07.845
You think I'd hurt you again?

32:08.013 --> 32:11.562
This the part where you tell me
you've turned a new leaf? Found God?

32:11.733 --> 32:13.291
Inner peace?

32:13.453 --> 32:16.365
We both know that isn't true.
You haven't changed. You can't.

32:16.533 --> 32:18.205
- Wes...
- Because you're sick.

32:18.373 --> 32:19.647
You've always been sick.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.202
It goes right down to the roots,
rotting your soul.

32:22.373 --> 32:25.809
That's why your friends turned on you,
why the Council tried to kill you.

32:25.973 --> 32:29.363
No one trusts you. You're a rabid dog
who should have been put down...

32:29.533 --> 32:31.330
[GRUNTS]

32:31.573 --> 32:34.007
See? Wasn't so hard, was it?

32:36.853 --> 32:39.128
It's what you'll need to beat him.

32:41.373 --> 32:43.011
No.

32:45.133 --> 32:47.693
You have to be willing
to take it all the way.

32:51.653 --> 32:56.488
I can't risk killing Angel.
Not after what he's done for me.

32:59.453 --> 33:02.206
There's gotta be another way.

33:03.893 --> 33:10.366
Oh. Smacked in the noggin with
a two-by-four wrapped in velvet.

33:10.653 --> 33:12.803
Yeah, that's what it felt like.

33:12.973 --> 33:15.567
I am so, so beyond sorry.

33:15.733 --> 33:19.692
Oh, go on. It's the first good nap
I've had since the Apocalypse started.

33:19.853 --> 33:23.129
- So, what did I miss?
- Angelus and his usual freak show.

33:23.293 --> 33:27.127
Everybody still has their necks attached.
The sanctuary spell did its thing?

33:27.493 --> 33:30.769
- Yeah, it's working.
LORNE: Hey, one for the good guys.

33:30.933 --> 33:32.730
And take two away.

33:32.893 --> 33:34.690
I let Angelus walk with Lilah's book...

33:34.853 --> 33:37.492
...and everything Wolfram and Hart
suckered out of you.

33:37.653 --> 33:39.006
I was gonna frame those.

33:39.173 --> 33:42.324
The vampire Moriarty strolls in
waving the anti-mojo mojo...

33:42.493 --> 33:44.529
...anybody would've done the same.
- Mojo?

33:44.693 --> 33:49.403
No-jo. He waved this piece of junk in
my face, and I went all spinal-paralysis.

33:50.613 --> 33:52.365
Put the blame stick down.

33:52.533 --> 33:55.889
Maury's been peddling these to tourists
since L.A. Had cable cars.

33:56.053 --> 33:59.011
Fools the Bermuda shorts off them
every single time.

33:59.173 --> 34:01.289
- Maury?
- You know where this guy is?

34:01.453 --> 34:04.286
Yeah, sure. He hangs his horns
in a shop down on Olive.

34:04.453 --> 34:06.171
- Why?
- Call Wes. Now.

34:36.933 --> 34:38.924
Even if he got the fake hoodoo
from Maury...

34:39.092 --> 34:41.447
...why would Angelus hang around?
- He wouldn't.

34:41.612 --> 34:45.208
But this Maury that Lorne knows
may be able to help us find...

34:45.373 --> 34:47.728
...where Angelus is hiding.

34:57.453 --> 34:59.250
ANGEL:
No.

34:59.533 --> 35:01.364
But I can.

35:09.013 --> 35:12.642
Little birdie in my head told me
you'd be here.

35:13.893 --> 35:16.487
Whoo! Exciting.

35:24.533 --> 35:26.125
Gotta do better than that, Wes.

35:28.013 --> 35:29.651
Come on, I'll give you one more.

35:33.933 --> 35:35.252
Strike three!

35:40.373 --> 35:41.692
Uh-oh.

35:42.573 --> 35:43.972
Vampire with a gun.

35:45.973 --> 35:47.691
I see why he likes this thing.

35:56.253 --> 35:57.572
Wow.

35:59.173 --> 36:02.324
You really have gone soft now,
haven't you?

36:02.493 --> 36:04.324
Hey!

36:04.613 --> 36:08.049
You remember that time you tried
to get Angel to kill you...

36:08.213 --> 36:13.731
...because you felt all weepy
over being such a bad little girl?

36:14.773 --> 36:17.128
Do you still feel that way?

36:17.493 --> 36:19.688
Do you still want to die?

36:21.133 --> 36:22.725
- No.
- What's that?

36:22.893 --> 36:24.121
- No.
- I can't hear you.

36:24.293 --> 36:25.851
No!

36:26.653 --> 36:27.972
[GUN COCKING]

36:29.813 --> 36:32.805
Too bad, because you're gonna.

36:38.533 --> 36:39.807
But not like this.

36:45.613 --> 36:47.569
Looks like we got a live one.

36:49.893 --> 36:51.246
For now.

36:55.853 --> 36:58.845
A little tired, sweetie?
Want to take a break?

37:06.693 --> 37:11.050
Now, this is disappointing.
You never used to bleed so easy.

37:11.213 --> 37:14.285
- Screw you!
- Maybe after.

37:14.773 --> 37:18.129
I like my girls to lie still.

37:20.613 --> 37:23.332
Hey, buddy, how's it going in there?

37:27.213 --> 37:31.889
Good old Wes. Always count on him to
tackle a bad situation and make it worse.

37:32.453 --> 37:35.684
I mean, hey, look how you turned out.

37:37.093 --> 37:41.086
But then again, I guess he really
didn't have much to work with, now.

37:41.333 --> 37:43.289
[LAUGHS]

37:43.493 --> 37:45.449
Save the head trip, GQ.

37:45.613 --> 37:48.173
Wes told me you'd try
to get under my skin.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.722
Gave me just what I need
to scratch you out.

37:50.893 --> 37:55.569
Oh, don't tell me. The rousing,
stiff-upper-lip speech.

37:55.733 --> 37:58.691
Rah, rah! Good over evil!
Do what must be done!

37:58.853 --> 38:01.367
Hang in there, kitten,
it's almost Friday!

38:01.533 --> 38:04.445
Is that what the scraggly,
little ponce armed you with...

38:04.613 --> 38:08.288
...to fight the big, bad bogeyman?

38:08.453 --> 38:10.762
Yeah. And this.

38:37.533 --> 38:39.649
ANGEL:
That hurt, baby.

38:39.813 --> 38:41.849
I kind of liked it.

38:42.013 --> 38:43.969
[LAUGHING]

38:45.293 --> 38:48.524
How about you? There's my girl.

38:48.693 --> 38:52.163
Knew she was in there somewhere,
dying to come out and play again.

38:52.333 --> 38:54.324
- Shut up.
- I know how it feels.

38:54.493 --> 38:58.486
Forced to be someone you're not.
Hurts to the bone.

38:58.733 --> 39:03.966
You try to bury the pain, but you can't
get the hole deep enough, can you?

39:04.813 --> 39:08.283
No matter how much you dig,
it's still there.

39:12.533 --> 39:18.085
Broken shards stabbing every time
you breathe, cutting you up inside.

39:18.253 --> 39:22.166
You know, there's only one way
to make the pain stop.

39:23.013 --> 39:24.446
Hurt someone else.

39:57.333 --> 39:59.893
Come on, Faith,
you're not even trying.

40:03.373 --> 40:05.284
Or is that why you really
came back, huh?

40:05.453 --> 40:09.002
Not enough to punish yourself
in prison? Is that it?

40:09.173 --> 40:11.482
Looking for someone
to beat the bad out of you?

40:13.693 --> 40:16.924
I could beat you to death,
but it wouldn't make a difference.

40:17.093 --> 40:20.051
Nothing will ever change
who you are, Faith.

40:20.693 --> 40:24.129
You're a murderer, an animal...

40:25.093 --> 40:26.082
...and you enjoy it.

40:27.613 --> 40:28.966
Just like me!

40:51.973 --> 40:53.201
No!

40:59.733 --> 41:03.328
You're wrong. I'm different now.
I'm not like you.

41:07.573 --> 41:09.211
But you will be.
