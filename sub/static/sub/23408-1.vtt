00:03.600 --> 00:06.400
* And now I know where to go

00:07.800 --> 00:09.800
* I'm not following a crowd

00:09.900 --> 00:14.000
* But there's so many faces staring at me

00:14.300 --> 00:17.000
* I'm not going with the flow

00:18.200 --> 00:21.300
* I've got to wave goodbye and say hello

00:21.400 --> 00:24.600
* To unfamiliar circumstances

00:27.600 --> 00:30.500
* I'm gonna start believing in myself

00:30.700 --> 00:32.900
* I'm gonna start believing in myself

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
* It's up to me and no-one else

00:35.100 --> 00:36.000
* I'm feeling...

00:36.100 --> 00:37.600
* ..this could be the start of something

00:37.700 --> 00:40.200
* I can feel my heart is jumping

00:40.300 --> 00:43.000
* Want to walk But can't stop running

00:43.100 --> 00:45.700
* Oooh I can't stop running

00:45.900 --> 00:48.300
* Good to be a part of something

00:48.400 --> 00:51.000
* Once upon a time was nothing

00:51.100 --> 00:53.400
* This could be the start of something

00:53.500 --> 00:57.100
* This could be the start of something good

00:59.700 --> 01:02.200
* Life's a bitch, life's a mess

01:03.600 --> 01:06.600
* Trying to find your way, it's not so easy

01:06.700 --> 01:09.700
* It's not the way it looks on TV

01:10.300 --> 01:13.300
* I'm fully clothed but still undressed

01:14.200 --> 01:17.300
* Like I'm walking on the highest wire

01:17.400 --> 01:20.600
* Without a safety net below me

01:23.800 --> 01:26.200
* Ain't another place I'd rather be

01:26.300 --> 01:30.900
* Listen to the voice inside of me that's shouting:

01:31.100 --> 01:33.500
* This could be the start of something

01:33.700 --> 01:36.300
* I can feel my heart is jumping

01:36.400 --> 01:39.100
* Want to walk but can't stop running

01:39.200 --> 01:41.600
* Ooh I can't stop running

01:41.700 --> 01:44.100
* Good to be a part of something

01:44.200 --> 01:46.900
* Once upon a time was nothing

01:47.100 --> 01:49.600
* This could be the start of something

01:49.800 --> 01:53.000
* This could be the start of something good

01:53.100 --> 01:57.800
* Good to be where I belong

01:58.100 --> 02:03.300
* It's just so good to belo-o-o-o-ong

02:03.500 --> 02:08.699
* Maybe this time is the one Time is the one

02:08.800 --> 02:14.600
* Maybe this time is the one time
I've been waiting for too long

02:18.900 --> 02:24.200
* Something

02:24.600 --> 02:26.900
* This could be the start of something

02:27.000 --> 02:29.500
* I can feel my heart is jumping

02:29.700 --> 02:32.300
* Want to walk but can't stop running

02:32.400 --> 02:35.000
* Ooh I can't stop running

02:35.100 --> 02:37.500
* Good to be a part of something

02:37.600 --> 02:40.300
* Once upon a time was nothing

02:40.400 --> 02:42.900
* This could be the start of something

02:43.000 --> 02:45.800
* This could be the start of something good *

03:07.600 --> 03:09.100
Here, let me.
Ooh.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.600
First day and the women are already falling at my feet.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.900
I er...bet you greased the floor up especially.

03:24.300 --> 03:28.000
Hey, I'm Danny. I'm here cos
it's the only thing I can do.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.500
The only thing
that makes me feel alive.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.600
We're not looking for luvvies
and West End Wendys.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.300
We want grafters. All-rounders.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.200
I want to fill arenas.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.900
I want my name up there
with the greats:

03:40.000 --> 03:42.800
Mariah, Celine, Madonna...

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
..Claudine.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.800
Being here will be the hardest,

03:46.900 --> 03:49.200
but the most rewarding
two years of your lives.

03:49.300 --> 03:52.400
I'm BB and
I wanna make something of my life.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.800
I'm fed up of feeling like
the only way is down...

03:56.300 --> 03:59.000
..so I'm here, looking up.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.900
I want you to think long and hard

04:01.000 --> 04:03.200
about why you came
to Britannia High.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.900
My name's Jez and I'm a performer.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.600
And I've been hooked on it for,
like, 16 years now.

04:09.700 --> 04:13.400
And, I don't know, I guess I need
the audience's constant reassurance

04:13.500 --> 04:16.100
that, hey, I'm OK.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.600
I think, potentially...

04:19.399 --> 04:20.899
..you are the best talent
in Britain.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.800
I'm, like, Lola.

04:22.900 --> 04:28.500
I wanna be, like, the dance
equivalent of a supermodel.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.800
I wanna be...a superdancer.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.300
Don't be a wannabe,
be who you want to be.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.100
Hi.
I'm Lauren Louise Loretta Waters.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.000
Big it up for the letter L.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.000
Anyway, erm,
for the past six months,

04:47.100 --> 04:49.800
I've been touring West Hampshire
with the Dancing Queens.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.600
We're an ABBA tribute band.

04:52.100 --> 04:56.400
And um, in the future,
I just want to prove that
there's more to me than Agnetha.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.000
Thank you very much.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.300
* Beware Of The Dog

05:10.900 --> 05:12.100
This is lovely.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.500
Keep it going.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.300
Very nice from some of you.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.300
Very good. I'm impressed - and
you won't often hear me say that.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
Keep it going. Come up here.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.100
We're just gonna take it
from the top, yeah?

05:33.300 --> 05:36.600
I saw her at a wedding.
What was she? An usher?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.100
Amazing voice,

05:39.400 --> 05:41.800
even if she was singing
with a Swedish accent.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Strip all that away,
she could sound like a young Sheryl.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.300
Baker?
Crowe.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.300
5,000 kids chasing 100 places.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.800
And you let her in
without so much as an audition?

05:58.200 --> 05:59.800
What's this business about?

06:00.500 --> 06:01.600
Unemployment.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.100
Breaks.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.700
I gave her one.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.200
Do the same for me, Anna.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.100
'This is Britannia High FM...'

06:18.100 --> 06:19.300
Follow me, gorgeous.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.300
I'm gonna be in pain tomorrow.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.100
I'm in pain now.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.800
I must be really unfit.
I don't know about that.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.400
Oh, no, you are. I can see.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.400
Danny from Bristol,
Claudine from London. BB from...?

06:36.700 --> 06:37.600
Manchester.

06:37.700 --> 06:41.000
And Lauren from...?
Somewhere with no designer shops.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.900
New Forest.

06:43.900 --> 06:48.000
'..our top 10 tips for the
fresh faced newcomers this term.'

06:48.100 --> 06:51.200
This radio station seems to know
a lot about what goes on here.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.100
It's the SCHOOL radio.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.000
Oh.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.500
So, er, what's this all about, then?

07:00.200 --> 07:03.100
First years' open mic spot
tonight in the students common room

07:03.200 --> 07:05.000
where we all freestyle.
Wicked.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.800
Cool.
Random.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.200
I'm gonna do the routine
I did for my audition.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.500
What are you gonna do?
Dazzle us with Dancing Queen?

07:14.900 --> 07:15.800
I'm not sure.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.200
What did you do for your audition?
Do that.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.100
No, she can't,
because you didn't audition.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.500
Did you, Laura?

07:26.800 --> 07:27.700
It's Lauren.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.500
Didn't audition? I worked
my backside off to be here.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.300
Tell me about it.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.400
So how did you get in, then?

07:35.500 --> 07:37.900
Nugent heard her singing
at a wedding.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.300
Oh, well, she must be good, then.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.900
You obviously
didn't see her dancing.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.700
* Check it, check it

07:51.700 --> 07:52.800
* Check it

07:54.000 --> 07:56.800
* Honey's only sweet as the bee

07:57.800 --> 08:00.800
* Who only ever takes what he needs

08:01.600 --> 08:04.700
* And deserts need the sun and the rain

08:05.400 --> 08:08.400
* Cos pleasure only comes after pain

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
* Fuel can take a minute to light

08:13.000 --> 08:16.200
* A wonderland you can build in a night

08:17.000 --> 08:19.900
* Two can burn a bridge in a day

08:20.600 --> 08:25.100
* When one of us is walking away,away

08:25.600 --> 08:27.000
Ooh, sorry.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.500
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -
- You know,

08:34.600 --> 08:36.500
I think you'll go far
in the business, Laura.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.700
- It's Lauren, actually.
- Well, "Lauren, actually",

08:40.000 --> 08:41.751
maybe one day,
you could be the lead in that.

Claudine.

09:04.900 --> 09:05.600
I know.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.600
This house is so mad,
you're gonna love it.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.900
But we've got all the best rooms,
sorry.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.400
Yeah, you're in the cupboard
under the stairs, mate.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.600
Who do you think she is, Danny,
Harry Potter?

09:23.700 --> 09:25.900
You have a glorious room
at the top of the house.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.600
I'm Doris Troy. I'm your landlady.
Lovely to meet you, Mrs Troy.

09:29.700 --> 09:33.000
If you'll please excuse me,
I need to continue with my portrait.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Who is it?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.200
Britney Spears.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.700
This room's not too bad.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.400
It's so...bijou.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.700
You know, I could take you shopping,
if you like.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.600
There's so many great places
round here.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.300
I could totally transform you.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.300
Er, thanks, but no thanks.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.900
I'm sorry
if I've...been a bit off with you.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.900
It's stressful for all of us,
you know, the first day, and that.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.300
Really?
Mm-hm.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.700
You seem so...confident.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.600
Believe me, sweetie,
I'm a good actress.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.500
I'm glad I'm not the only one
that's finding it hard.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.200
I nearly walked out a few times.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.100
I understand, babes.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.200
It must be harder for you
than anybody.

10:31.800 --> 10:35.000
I mean, the rest of us, we've worked
towards a place here for years.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.500
And, because we had to audition...

10:39.500 --> 10:40.700
..we earned it.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.400
Well, um, obviously Mr Nugent
thinks I've got what it takes.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.600
And I'm sure he's right.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.300
It's a good thing you get chance to
show the rest of us what you can do

10:51.400 --> 10:53.100
at the open mic spot tonight.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.800
What is it you're doing again?

10:56.900 --> 10:58.200
I'm not sure yet.

10:58.900 --> 11:02.800
I can't wait to see. I know it's
going to be total fantabulosity.

11:03.900 --> 11:07.000
Anyhow, I'll leave you to it.
I have to go and get ready.

11:08.700 --> 11:11.500
I'd lend you something amazing
to wear

11:11.600 --> 11:15.200
but...I don't think
we're the same size.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.200
* Like, like this

12:30.300 --> 12:32.400
* Walk this way

12:32.500 --> 12:34.400
* Talk this way

12:34.600 --> 12:38.800
* Walk this way, talk this way

12:38.900 --> 12:40.900
* Walk this way

12:41.100 --> 12:43.200
* Talk this way

12:43.400 --> 12:47.500
* Walk this way, talk this way

12:49.100 --> 12:50.300
* Like this

12:51.300 --> 12:52.600
* Like this *

13:22.100 --> 13:23.800
Yeah! Yeah, Jez!

13:25.300 --> 13:26.200
Hello, Mum.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.200
Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?

13:28.700 --> 13:30.200
How are the dogs?

13:32.800 --> 13:34.600
Yeah, I'm having a great time.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.300
Everyone's really nice and...

13:39.500 --> 13:41.500
Yeah, well,
obviously, it's hard work.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.000
No, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.300
I'll call you soon.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.100
I love you. Bye.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.300
So I hear last night
went really well.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.800
Yeah, it was wicked.

14:21.100 --> 14:25.200
For those of us who made it.
I wasn't well, sorry.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.400
Right, well, it's a great way
to kick-start the term.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.800
Now, from hereon in,
I want you guys to think teamwork.

14:33.100 --> 14:36.800
I say this as, a week on Friday,
something very special is happening.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.300
You've got a date with Cameron Diaz?
No, that's Thursday.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.100
A week on Friday,

14:42.500 --> 14:47.200
you'll be having your first Showcase
evening of the new term.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.500
These are regular, important events,

14:49.600 --> 14:52.700
where we get to show
an invited audience exactly what

14:52.800 --> 14:55.200
you first years have been up to.
No pressure, then (!)

14:55.300 --> 14:57.700
So, BB, you might wanna invest
in some tights.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
Do I look like a girl?

14:59.600 --> 15:03.900
I've travelled extensively. You'll
be surprised by the girls I've met.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.700
More importantly,

15:06.800 --> 15:10.500
this Showcase evening is
your first assessment of the year.

15:11.300 --> 15:15.000
In the past, some haven't made it
further than that Friday evening,

15:15.100 --> 15:19.300
so I cannot stress how vital it is
for you to work hard

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
and for you to work as a team.

15:22.800 --> 15:27.500
I can't wait to see my family.
I'm filling up. I miss them so much.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.200
I've not seen them in...
..two whole days.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.500
And Garth'll probably bring
his grandfather.

15:32.900 --> 15:36.100
You know who his grandfather is?
Simon Cowell.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.200
Can you believe that?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.500
Simon Cowell's Garth's grandfather?

15:41.700 --> 15:44.100
Oh, sorry, godfather.
Look at his pants.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.300
Do they share the same stylist,
or what?

15:47.600 --> 15:53.000
So you're telling me that Simon
Cowell is coming to see us perform?

15:53.100 --> 15:56.700
I know when he clocks me,
he's so gonna ditch that girlfriend.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.300
Hey, turn the volume down, please,
yeah?

16:00.800 --> 16:02.900
All right, let's go back
to the routine from the hinge.

16:02.900 --> 16:05.300
Five, six, seven, and...

16:05.500 --> 16:07.500
* Who's That Girl?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Lauren, you need to work a lot
harder if you want to keep up, OK?

16:18.100 --> 16:19.700
* Good girls are pretty, like all the time

16:20.200 --> 16:24.800
* I'm just pretty some of the time

16:29.200 --> 16:31.600
* Good girls are happy

16:31.700 --> 16:33.900
* And satisfied...

16:35.000 --> 16:36.800
All right. How are you?

16:36.900 --> 16:38.400
Just a little under pressure.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.800
* I just can't deal with the rules

16:45.900 --> 16:48.000
* I can't take the pressure *

16:48.100 --> 16:50.400
Just this, please.
You'll waste away.

16:59.300 --> 17:03.800
Three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.900
One, two, three, four,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.300
five, six, seven, eight... One...

17:10.599 --> 17:12.599
This is the lift. It's quite hard.

17:25.400 --> 17:29.000
So that's what you'll be doing
at the Showcase evening, OK?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.900
Now, I want you all in pairs.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.100
So, Claudine, go with BB, please.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.600
Lola, take Jez. Danny, Lauren.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.100
Jokes, Jessica.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.100
Darren, Naomi. Amber with Garth.

17:40.200 --> 17:44.000
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.700
One, two, three, four,

17:46.800 --> 17:49.300
five, six, seven, eight.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.600
One and jump.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.000
And Jez and jump.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.100
Go, Jokes. Come on, Lauren.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.100
And lift.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.200
Now, that's just what I wanted (!)

18:12.100 --> 18:13.100
Sorry.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.500
Need another two for 17.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.200
Where's Lauren?

18:21.300 --> 18:23.700
They're potatoes, Lauren.
Potatoes. Come on.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.500
Come on, Lauren.
Pick it up a bit, will you?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.000
Not there.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.800
Come on, Lauren.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.000
Spillage!

19:06.400 --> 19:07.800
Danny, what do you want?

19:08.200 --> 19:09.000
Are you all right?

19:10.100 --> 19:12.300
I'm on a break.
I've only got five minutes.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.200
Is that your boyfriend, Lauren?

19:14.600 --> 19:16.700
Shut up, Pedro,
he's my dance partner.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.700
Oh, is that what
they're calling it now?

19:19.700 --> 19:21.200
Are you stalking me?

19:22.100 --> 19:26.400
I just thought, you know, you might
be in need of a bit of a lift.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.900
Do you wanna go out some time?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.200
Time to get back, Lauren.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.000
OK, Pedro.
Back to it, lads.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.700
Sorry, I've got to go.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.700
..whereas Stanislavski's approach
to method acting was that,

20:22.800 --> 20:26.400
in order to be credible on stage,
you had to live the part...

20:28.400 --> 20:31.100
Currently,
Lauren Waters is demonstrating

20:31.200 --> 20:35.300
some very interesting method acting
for the part of Sleeping Beauty.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.700
Who's gonna kiss her?
I will.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.400
Oh, please!

20:40.700 --> 20:41.800
Sorry, chef.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.100
..Mr Nugent.
Yeah.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.900
Good work, Lauren, very good. Now...

20:52.200 --> 20:55.300
A thousand years ago,
in a galaxy far, far away,

20:55.500 --> 20:56.700
a director took a punt on me.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.000
Cast me as the lead
in this new musical.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.400
I was young, naive,

21:01.600 --> 21:03.800
thin - well, thinner.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.300
I thought I could take on anything.
I wasn't ready.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.900
As rehearsals wore on,
it became abundantly clear,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.700
I was terrible.

21:11.800 --> 21:16.000
Every day, I went in, determined
this was gonna be the day
I was gonna throw in the towel.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.200
Every time I went to speak,
the words just died in my mouth.

21:19.300 --> 21:21.600
Then, one day, he fired me.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.000
Recast me with Michael Ball.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.600
Whatever happened to him, eh (?)

21:25.800 --> 21:28.300
Oh, he's really famous.
No, that was a joke.

21:30.100 --> 21:31.900
I just wish I'd had the nerve

21:32.000 --> 21:34.700
to hand in my notice
before being humiliated.

21:36.300 --> 21:39.600
Are you gonna quit
or are you gonna carry on?

21:40.200 --> 21:43.500
Lauren, come on. You're late for
the recording session.

21:57.500 --> 22:02.000
* There is no shortcut to a dream

22:02.300 --> 22:05.400
* But I am not afraid

22:05.500 --> 22:09.300
* I'll take it all the way

22:10.400 --> 22:15.000
* I'm gonna give more than it takes

22:15.100 --> 22:18.200
* Work harder than the rest

22:18.400 --> 22:21.900
* Till I'm the very best

22:22.400 --> 22:25.300
* Oh, you think you've got it all figured out

22:25.400 --> 22:28.700
* You think you're so damn cool, What's that all about?

22:28.800 --> 22:31.800
* But I got mine, just watch this space

22:31.900 --> 22:35.400
* If you just wait

22:36.000 --> 22:38.200
* Hold up a mirror, you should see yourself

22:38.300 --> 22:41.700
* You think you're so much better than everybody else

22:41.800 --> 22:44.600
* But I got time, just watch this space

22:44.700 --> 22:49.000
* If you just wait

22:49.400 --> 22:53.800
* There's something deep inside my heart

22:53.900 --> 22:57.100
* Burns with a thousand fires

22:57.200 --> 23:01.100
* So relentless, my desire

23:02.300 --> 23:07.100
* You see a future shine so bright

23:07.200 --> 23:10.200
* Beyond the finish line

23:10.300 --> 23:15.000
* I'm gonna make it mine Ohh

23:15.100 --> 23:17.200
* You think you got it all figured out

23:17.300 --> 23:20.700
* You think you're so damn special, What's that all about?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.700
* But I've got mine, yeah, watch this space

23:23.800 --> 23:27.400
* And you just wait

23:27.900 --> 23:30.200
* Hold up a mirror, you should see yourself

23:30.300 --> 23:33.600
* You think that you won't stumble like everybody else

23:33.700 --> 23:36.700
* But I got time, just watch this space

23:36.800 --> 23:40.900
* If you just wait

23:41.100 --> 23:44.200
* You bring your best I'll be one step ahead

23:44.300 --> 23:49.000
* No tears will fall You'll be falling instead

23:49.700 --> 23:53.700
* Oh, you just wait

23:54.100 --> 23:57.100
* I'm not afraid and I'm not backing down

23:57.200 --> 24:01.600
* The shock of your life is what's coming around

24:03.200 --> 24:06.800
* You just wait *

24:45.000 --> 24:46.200
I'm not gonna quit.

24:50.500 --> 24:58.100

25:17.700 --> 25:18.700
OK.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.900
Just chill.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.200
Relax.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.500
Chill-ax.
Look, I may as well just face facts.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.400
I'm so out of here on Friday.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.100
Look, why don't we call it a day:

25:31.300 --> 25:32.800
go and have a laugh?

25:41.200 --> 25:42.400
Oh, no, thank you.

25:47.700 --> 25:52.500
I love London. It's so random,
you can just lose yourself.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.000
Yeah, literally.

25:54.100 --> 25:57.900
Don't you think it's a buzz?
It's scary. There's too many people.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.600
Yeah. And no-one cares.

26:00.800 --> 26:01.800
Look.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.500
What are you doing?

26:08.300 --> 26:09.300
Danny.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.800
You know, all these faces
are never gonna see us again.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.900
Well, until
we've got our names up in lights.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.500
Yes. So you can do what you wanna do.
Be who you wanna be.

26:23.300 --> 26:27.400
Now, that's...that's Eros...

26:28.600 --> 26:30.000
..the god of love.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.700
Nearly.
I'm never going to get it right.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.400
You will. I bet you any money.

26:51.100 --> 26:52.500
Why did you -
What made you...

26:55.500 --> 26:56.500
You first.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.500
What made you wanna perform?

27:03.800 --> 27:07.200
I saw this - I saw this film crew
once, at the end of our street.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.300
I sat there watching for hours.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.300
Just totally glued.

27:16.100 --> 27:20.500
Everyone else watching just...
just thought it was boring.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.200
But, to me, it was...

27:24.500 --> 27:25.800
..pure adrenaline.

27:26.500 --> 27:27.800
Turning,

27:28.100 --> 27:29.400
speed

27:29.600 --> 27:31.600
and action.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.800
I just thought, you know,

27:36.500 --> 27:38.100
"I'll have some of that."

27:39.900 --> 27:42.400
I felt like that
when I went to see S Club 7.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.000
I went to see them in concert
when I was about eight.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.100
Watching them on stage,
everyone was so happy.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.300
The audience
were just so full of joy.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.700
I thought: "That's what I wanna do.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.200
I wanna make people happy."

28:08.600 --> 28:10.000
What am I like?

28:17.900 --> 28:19.100
Wicked.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.900
What are you doing? Come on.
You wanna make people happy?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.300
Let's make 'em happy.

28:35.900 --> 28:37.700
Danny.
Woo!

28:42.400 --> 28:43.900
Are you looking at that poster,
is it?

28:44.200 --> 28:45.800
Oh, no, no. Course not.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.500
So, you - are you gonna go for it?

28:49.400 --> 28:50.700
Dunno. Are you?

28:52.500 --> 28:53.500
Dunno.

28:55.900 --> 29:00.600
* NEW YOUNG PONY CLUB

29:11.200 --> 29:12.600
The Get Go
In a minute, Rihanna,

29:12.700 --> 29:14.900
but first, for all the culturally
ambitious amongst you,

29:15.000 --> 29:19.600
let me tell you about the auditions
for dancers for a pop music video.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.900
Coming up after the break,
we've got T-Pain

29:24.000 --> 29:27.400
with his swag new joint,
which is fresh to death, innit.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.300
(What?)

29:30.100 --> 29:33.800
I can't believe, on Friday, I'm
actually gonna meet Simon Cowell.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.000
What am I gonna wear?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.200
I'm guessing
not a yashmak and burka.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.200
Look who it isn't.
Hi, Simon, it's Garth.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.600
Oh, my God. He's talking to him.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.100
It's just a bit -
Garth!

29:49.300 --> 29:50.300
Hi, Simon.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.800
It's Lola here.
I'm a class mate of Garth's.

29:52.900 --> 29:55.600
Isn't he just too cool for school?

29:56.200 --> 29:57.600
He's so working a high-waist look.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.400
Listen, loving your work
in X Factor, sweetie.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.400
Really great format.
Really great teeth.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.900
Sorry? Hello?

30:08.500 --> 30:09.500
Simon?

30:12.200 --> 30:13.400
He hung up,

30:14.200 --> 30:15.700
after swearing at me.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.200
Lola, my godfather
isn't Simon Cowell.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.800
He's not?
He's Simon Callow.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.600
Who?
The Shakespearean actor.

30:29.300 --> 30:30.900
I still don't see
why we should have to.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.500
Oh, you're such a rebel, BB.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.300
You might get off on wearing tights

30:34.400 --> 30:36.600
but where I come from
I'd get my head kicked in.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.200
Ballet's like
the basis of all forms of dance.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.500
And, well, you're into dance, right?
That's right.

30:41.900 --> 30:44.300
Every dance move
kind of stems from a ballet move.

30:44.500 --> 30:47.500
In theory, know they ballet,
know thy dance.

30:47.900 --> 30:48.600
Thy?!

30:48.700 --> 30:51.200
Careful, you'll get me talking
in iambic pentameters next.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.000
OK, I take all the ballet stuff
and that, yeah.

30:54.800 --> 30:58.300
But tights...they're tight, man.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.500
I think it's called streamlining.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.100
Guys.
Oh, are you all right?

31:03.200 --> 31:05.600
Call me crazy,
but I've just had an idea.

31:05.900 --> 31:10.300
Right, you don't need scripts.
Just talk.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.400
What about?
Anything.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.500
Be yourselves. Talk about something
funny that happened to you today.

31:15.600 --> 31:19.200
Something weird,
something wonderful. Just talk.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.100
You're live on air.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.700
'This is Britannia High FM.'

31:26.000 --> 31:28.300
I seen this woman on the bus
this morning, right,

31:28.600 --> 31:30.100
and I thought she was pregnant -
Oh, dear.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.800
So I stand up and I let her sit down
and go, "When's it due?"

31:34.000 --> 31:36.800
Oh, and she wasn't pregnant?
She wasn't pregnant.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.300
Things not to say No.1. Like,
"What have you done to your hair?

31:40.400 --> 31:43.100
Oh. That's what
it's supposed to be like."

31:44.400 --> 31:48.100
"Nice outfit. There's not
many people out there with
Jabba the Hutt as a style icon."

31:48.200 --> 31:50.000
Or, on your first date,

31:50.100 --> 31:54.200
"This restaurant stinks of garlic.
Oh, no, that's you, isn't it?"

31:59.000 --> 32:01.400
Hi, babe. Yeah, it starts at eight.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.200
Your name's on the guest list.

32:04.000 --> 32:04.700
Hang on.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.600
Hi, sweetie, how's you?

32:08.600 --> 32:10.600
Of course
there's an after show party.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.900
You'd think I'd get involved
in something without a party
at the end of it?

32:15.200 --> 32:17.600
OK. Cool. Yeah.
I'll see you, then. Bye.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.000
I'm so nervous.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.200
Try some deep breathing.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.300
I'm too shallow for deep breathing.

32:30.300 --> 32:34.700
You know, if you're not feeling
up to it, we can cut the lift.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.900
No, it's OK. I'm doing it.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.900
Good. We need a laugh.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.400
Oh, drop dead, Claudine.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.100
Go on, L.
Go, Lauren.

32:53.800 --> 32:54.700
Hey.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.200
Well, you told her.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.700
That's not me, Danny.
I hate what this place is making me.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.600
It's not this place, it's you.

33:03.100 --> 33:05.000
You're pushing yourself too hard.

33:05.300 --> 33:06.700
Look, you're shaking.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.700
Stage fright. I always get it.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.400
Even when I was Agnetha,

33:12.500 --> 33:15.300
I only had to hear the intro
to Waterloo and I was gone.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.500
Look, forget about the audience.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.600
And definitely forget about Claudine
having a PhD in bitchiness.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.800
This week's about -
it's about teamwork.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.600
And...we're a team.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.200
You and me.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.900
This is
your Act One beginners' call.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.100
My God! I can see my mum.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.300
She's so showing me up
in last season's Uggs.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.400
That's so professional, Lola (!)

33:45.700 --> 33:47.200
So, who have you got coming, then?

33:47.700 --> 33:49.600
Not really my brother's thing.
What about you?

33:49.900 --> 33:53.200
Well, my dad said he'd come,
but he's always letting me down.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.800
At least you've got one.
Starting positions!

33:57.200 --> 33:58.500
She's gonna do it?

33:58.600 --> 34:00.000
Of course she's gonna do it.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.000
You're mad.
She's gonna make us look well bad.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.900
Spot the girl who didn't audition.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.600
Maybe she's right.
Maybe we should just ditch it.

34:15.699 --> 34:16.900
I don't wanna mess it up
for everyone.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.100
Why don't I just quit
while I'm behind?

34:19.199 --> 34:24.000
Look, Lauren, you've got more talent
than the rest of them put together.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.400
I know you can do it.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.600
Ooh, sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

34:33.800 --> 34:37.199
Good evening. Welcome to
the first Showcase of the new term.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.600
It's nice to see so many friends and
family here to show your support.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.500
The students will be getting
assessed on tonight's performance,

34:43.600 --> 34:45.400
so they're a wee bit nervous.

34:45.800 --> 34:50.600
Without further ado, please sit
back, relax and enjoy the show.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.800
When I did first impart
my love to you,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.300
I freely told you that
all the love I had ran in my veins.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.200
I was a gentleman.

35:23.500 --> 35:27.600
Rating myself at nothing, you shall
see how much a braggart I was.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.900
Have all his ventures failed?

37:47.200 --> 37:49.700
You're right. I take it all back.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.200
She's amazing.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.400
Oh, my God, that was so cool.
I could kiss you all.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.000
But you won't.
You want a bet, mate?

38:14.800 --> 38:16.100
That was wicked.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.200
Are you OK?

38:20.400 --> 38:21.400
Lauren!

38:22.200 --> 38:22.900
Is she all right?

38:23.000 --> 38:26.500
Lauren. Lauren, come on. Wake up.
She was fine...

38:26.600 --> 38:27.400
Lauren, wake up.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.200
Someone do something.

38:36.800 --> 38:44.300

38:51.900 --> 38:54.200
What were you thinking?
What?

38:54.700 --> 38:56.600
I run a performing arts school,
not a boot camp.

38:56.700 --> 38:59.500
I don't belong here.
Where are you gonna go, then?

38:59.600 --> 39:02.400
Hmm? Home?
Back to your ABBA tribute band?

39:02.500 --> 39:03.500
No.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.600
Oh, I don't know.

39:08.500 --> 39:09.500
Listen to me.

39:11.700 --> 39:14.500
For one moment out there,
you believed in yourself.

39:15.100 --> 39:16.600
Look what happened.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.400
You are exceptionally talented.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.000
You just don't realise it.

39:27.500 --> 39:32.800
"It's lack of faith that makes
people afraid of meeting challenges.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.500
And I believe in myself."

39:36.600 --> 39:37.900
Do you know who said that?

39:38.500 --> 39:39.900
Muhammad Ali.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.700
He was a winner, wasn't he?
Knew what he was talking about.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.100
You have faith.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.800
Believe in yourself.

39:49.900 --> 39:51.100
I do.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.300
I feel well bad.

40:14.700 --> 40:17.700
She has a conscience and a heart -
wonders will never cease (!)

40:17.800 --> 40:19.500
I didn't want her to die.

40:19.800 --> 40:22.300
Oh, you're such a drama queen,
Claudine.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.300
We're all drama queens here,
darling.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.700
What am I like?

40:26.800 --> 40:28.200
Babe, are you OK?

40:28.500 --> 40:30.700
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just overdid it a bit.

40:30.900 --> 40:34.200
You were wicked tonight, L.
Oh, shut up. I wasn't that good.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.800
BB's right. You were great, babe.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.500
Even if you didn't audition.

40:39.800 --> 40:43.600
Why the face?
I can be nice when I wanna be.

40:43.800 --> 40:46.700
Which isn't very often,
so make the most of it.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.000
Anyway, where's this party?
Up on the roof.

40:50.100 --> 40:52.100
Well, what are we waiting for?

41:02.200 --> 41:03.500
Hey, come here.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.000
Thank you.

41:09.900 --> 41:10.900
For what?

41:11.700 --> 41:14.900
Well, you were the only one
who believed in me.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.300
I fancy you like mad.

41:21.500 --> 41:22.700
I do.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.000
Really?

41:44.900 --> 41:46.000
Come on.

41:59.500 --> 42:02.700
* It's the same old line and the same old chat

42:02.800 --> 42:06.000
* You can't do this, you can't do that

42:06.200 --> 42:11.600
* I don't wanna hear it any more

42:12.700 --> 42:16.100
* I see that look that's in your eye

42:16.200 --> 42:19.400
* You judge by the cover, not what's inside

42:19.500 --> 42:24.900
* I don't wanna see it any more

42:26.300 --> 42:31.500
* Hope is coming r-o-o-o-o-ound

42:31.600 --> 42:35.400
* I don't wanna let go I don't wanna let go

42:35.500 --> 42:38.400
* I'm not letting myself down

42:38.500 --> 42:41.700
* I don't wanna let go-o-o I don't wanna let go

42:41.800 --> 42:44.800
* I've come too far to turn around

42:44.900 --> 42:48.400

43:02.700 --> 43:06.200
* Till you've seen the best of me

43:09.300 --> 43:13.200
* Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah Till you've seen the best of me

43:18.300 --> 43:22.500
* I don't wanna let go I don't wanna let go

43:22.600 --> 43:25.000

下集预告

43:49.800 --> 43:52.100
Danny, will you pay attention?
I'm not struggling.

43:52.200 --> 43:55.800
Nicola and Kimberley from Girls
Aloud will be joining us next week.

43:55.900 --> 44:00.500
That F stands for fail.
If I were you, I'd have a long,
hard think about my future here.

44:00.600 --> 44:01.677
What is going on with you?

44:01.677 --> 44:03.385
What? Is that all you can say?

44:04.000 --> 44:07.800
It's not your experience.
It's mine.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.900
* Wake up! Wake up! Wake up and...

44:11.000 --> 44:13.900
* ..live your life

44:14.200 --> 44:17.300
* Wake up! Wake up!  Be strong

44:17.400 --> 44:19.900
* It'll be all right

44:20.100 --> 44:22.900
* When you feel it and you know it

44:23.000 --> 44:25.900
* Wanna shout it, wanna show it

44:26.000 --> 44:28.800
* When you feel it and you know it

44:28.900 --> 44:31.800
* Wanna shout it, wanna show it

44:31.900 --> 44:34.400
* Wake up! Wake up!

44:34.500 --> 44:39.300
