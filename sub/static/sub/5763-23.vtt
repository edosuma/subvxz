- Breathe, breathe--
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

00:11.640 --> 00:13.450
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

00:13.990 --> 00:16.420
In with the good air, out with the bad.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.120
Ok, breathe. We're almost there, ok?

00:25.940 --> 00:28.030
Melinda, I'm right here. Just keep breathing.

00:28.331 --> 00:29.031
Grab me!

00:32.330 --> 00:33.130
This is it, this is it?

00:34.331 --> 00:35.331
This is it here.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.200
There we are, number 4, that's it.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.520
Ok, ok. And one, two, three.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.490
Come on, it's ok, push!

00:43.591 --> 00:45.491
Come on, it's ok, push!

00:45.560 --> 00:46.830
It's ok, come on, Mel!

00:47.300 --> 00:50.400
Push! One, two, three.

00:50.701 --> 00:51.901
Ok! Push!

00:52.302 --> 00:52.902
Ok!

01:01.720 --> 01:02.870
You did great.

01:05.410 --> 01:07.030
Can I see my baby?

01:09.470 --> 01:11.300
Don't you mean babies?

01:12.130 --> 01:12.990
What?

01:35.070 --> 01:36.320
How bad was that one?

01:36.950 --> 01:39.510
Well, let's just say "meow" and leave it at that.

01:39.780 --> 01:42.470
You think maybe you should mention
these dreams to your doctor?

01:42.560 --> 01:44.230
No, no, I'm sure it's nothing.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.340
I got my dress today.

01:46.370 --> 01:47.200
Yeah, that's right.

01:47.950 --> 01:49.500
Hey, you think I could have a little look?

01:49.610 --> 01:51.220
Absolutely not!

01:51.250 --> 01:54.350
Ok? Store remains off limits until further notice.

02:05.450 --> 02:06.760
That's breathtaking.

02:06.870 --> 02:08.150
- Really, you think?
- Yeah.

02:14.410 --> 02:15.740
Well said.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.440
Why don't you put your eyes
back in your head,

02:18.441 --> 02:20.141
and give me one of those lattes.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.200
- Are you sure it's not too much? I mean--
- No!

02:22.710 --> 02:23.820
Definitely not.

02:24.860 --> 02:25.970
She was asking me.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.380
And it is perfect.

02:29.460 --> 02:30.690
You're perfect.

02:33.190 --> 02:34.130
- All right.
- Ok.

02:34.140 --> 02:35.210
- Ok.
- I know.

02:35.220 --> 02:36.580
Let's cut me out of this thing.

02:36.581 --> 02:38.081
I'm gonna be late for lunch with Eli.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.630
Melinda Gordon?

02:43.140 --> 02:44.730
I'm Gordon Brady.

02:45.430 --> 02:47.520
And I'm here to give you
the wedding of your dreams.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.790
You must not be too familiar with my dreams.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.100
Who are you?

02:52.440 --> 02:54.230
Some call me a wedding planner,

02:54.231 --> 02:56.131
others a dream weaver.

02:56.150 --> 02:58.200
You can call me an ambassador of love.

02:58.370 --> 02:59.840
Didn't your mother tell you?

03:00.940 --> 03:01.890
No!

03:02.000 --> 03:03.530
No, my mother didn't tell me!

03:03.540 --> 03:06.260
A surprise! I hope that doesn't
hinder cooperation.

03:06.330 --> 03:09.130
Your mother reached out to me
to look after your wedding day.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.850
She said, and I quote,

03:10.851 --> 03:12.351
"make it unforgettable."

03:12.370 --> 03:14.010
Nice dress, by the way. Is the lace a must?

03:14.040 --> 03:16.820
It just clashes ever so slightly
with the linens I had in mind.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.610
Ok, all right, maybe we should just
take a breath for a minute.

03:19.620 --> 03:20.680
No, no, no. You take a breath.

03:20.681 --> 03:23.381
In, in, in. Hold...

03:27.070 --> 03:29.490
Gordon is here.
It's my wedding now.

03:51.340 --> 03:52.190
Eli!

03:53.391 --> 03:53.891
<i>Sorry.</i>

03:54.290 --> 03:55.250
Eli?

03:58.820 --> 03:59.640
Zoe.

04:00.570 --> 04:01.510
Didn't see you there.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.910
Eli, this is Jeremy Bishop.

04:04.050 --> 04:04.820
How you doing?

04:05.120 --> 04:06.980
Jeremy and I met at the university.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.750
Jeremy is going to the--

04:08.800 --> 04:11.750
No, it's fine. No need to explain, really.

04:12.070 --> 04:13.310
Explain what?

04:13.340 --> 04:14.500
Anything, really.

04:14.501 --> 04:17.500
Explanations are usually boring in general.

04:17.649 --> 04:20.589
So... you guys are having lunch?

04:21.070 --> 04:21.779
Yeah.

04:22.710 --> 04:23.590
How's that going?

04:24.520 --> 04:26.000
It's a little too early to tell.

04:26.910 --> 04:28.960
Meaning we just got our salads.

04:30.260 --> 04:31.690
Are you here by yourself?

04:31.720 --> 04:34.020
No, no, I have a lunch date.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.180
- Female one.
- Good for you!

04:37.190 --> 04:39.790
Nothing serious. Just playing the field.

04:39.930 --> 04:41.670
I mean, out in the field playing.

04:41.700 --> 04:42.670
I mean, I'm just...

04:43.571 --> 04:45.371
running the bases, just trying to...

04:46.570 --> 04:49.900
Get to the stadium. I--
There she is, all right.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.470
So better never than late,
so you guys...

04:52.790 --> 04:54.650
- Be good. Yeah. You...
- Bye.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.960
- Did you bring a shovel?
- Why?

04:57.980 --> 05:00.400
Because I need to be hit with one,
hard, in the face right now.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.590
I didn't really feel like a sit-Down lunch anyway.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.680
So because you're jealous of Zoe and that guy,

05:05.681 --> 05:07.781
I have to have lunch at the umbrella room?

05:07.980 --> 05:09.590
Jealous? Please!

05:09.630 --> 05:11.810
I could care less who zoe has lunch with.

05:12.630 --> 05:15.100
Who is this guy? It's driving me nuts.

05:15.170 --> 05:18.030
The last time I saw Zoe,
she was in tears

05:18.100 --> 05:21.030
because the University's selling
its book collection to raise money.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.750
- Ouch.
- Yeah. The next thing I know,

05:22.830 --> 05:25.880
her and George Clooney are feeding
each other bon bons at lunch.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.820
Can we please talk about my dream?

05:28.100 --> 05:30.830
Ok. So you're in the delivery room
and you ask to see your baby.

05:30.950 --> 05:33.400
Yes, and then the nurse says,
"don't you mean babies?"

05:33.420 --> 05:35.470
Plural. Then she wheels out this basinet full of--

05:35.480 --> 05:36.880
- Kittens.
- Kittens.

05:36.890 --> 05:37.630
How did you know that?

05:37.650 --> 05:39.860
'Cause it's a totally typical
pregnant woman dream.

05:40.170 --> 05:41.200
Sometimes its puppies,

05:41.249 --> 05:43.549
but either way, there's usually paws involved.

05:44.850 --> 05:45.820
Hello?

05:46.390 --> 05:47.420
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:47.590 --> 05:50.370
You know, I should probably get going
anyway, and I'm sorry for being distracted.

05:50.380 --> 05:53.250
Next time we have lunch, promise, totally present.

05:53.390 --> 05:55.750
Ok, well, bring a shovel.

05:55.910 --> 05:57.800
- Just in case.
- Yeah.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.000
What are you doing here?

06:09.030 --> 06:11.090
There's something you need to know.

06:11.310 --> 06:12.190
What?

06:16.310 --> 06:19.470
Your future is in her hands.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.830
It's a matter of life and death.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.030
<b>GHOST WHISPERER</b>

06:36.240 --> 06:41.290
<b>Season 04 - Episode 23</b>

06:42.420 --> 06:47.440
<b>THE BOOK OF CHANGES</b>

06:48.520 --> 06:53.500
<b></b>

06:54.701 --> 06:59.701
<b>Billie - Kathymini</b>

07:00.200 --> 07:02.500
Wait a minute, he said "her"?

07:03.301 --> 07:05.301
Your future is in her hands.

07:06.340 --> 07:07.070
What does he mean?

07:07.230 --> 07:08.940
I don't know, he was looking at my belly.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.590
Maybe he just got it, you know, backwards.

07:10.670 --> 07:13.560
Yeah, I don't think the watchers
do an opposite day.

07:13.970 --> 07:16.700
Then maybe we need to go to your doctor

07:16.720 --> 07:18.430
and ask him whether or not we're
having a boy or girl.

07:18.450 --> 07:19.630
We said we didn't want to know.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.790
No, no, you said, and then I was pressured into--

07:21.810 --> 07:23.770
No, I said that I wanted it to be a surprise,

07:23.771 --> 07:24.871
and you agreed.

07:25.420 --> 07:26.930
- You're right.
- Ok.

07:27.031 --> 07:29.431
And Eli says that weird dreams are typical

07:29.432 --> 07:31.632
of pregnant women, so maybe this qualifies.

07:32.630 --> 07:34.820
When have you ever had a typical dream?

07:34.930 --> 07:35.850
I know.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.810
Look, I just-- I don't want to worry
about anything else, you know,

07:38.819 --> 07:40.919
especially with this big wedding, and...

07:41.220 --> 07:44.260
really, a big wedding...
it just doesn't feel right.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.440
I hear you. But look, if your mom wants to
do this, I think we should let her, you know?

07:48.449 --> 07:50.749
I mean, it's just her way of saying she cares.

07:50.754 --> 07:52.554
No, it is her way of dealing with guilt

07:52.583 --> 07:55.583
because she doesn't even come back from
her trip until the day before the wedding.

07:58.532 --> 07:59.732
Here's to your mom.

07:59.940 --> 08:02.440
And to the comfort of predictability.

08:02.470 --> 08:05.580
And... to our big wedding.

08:06.891 --> 08:08.991
Because no matter how big it gets, it's still

08:09.070 --> 08:10.670
just about you and me.

08:11.610 --> 08:12.700
Here's to that.

08:25.580 --> 08:26.590
Jim?

08:39.289 --> 08:40.730
Who are you?

09:32.689 --> 09:33.789
And...

09:33.990 --> 09:36.010
at that point, well, you know,
I warned him not to move,

09:36.014 --> 09:37.914
and I told him to drop the book.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.059
We struggled.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.590
Had him pinned pretty good, but...

09:42.150 --> 09:43.820
he managed to get past me.

09:45.021 --> 09:45.921
Dr. James,

09:45.950 --> 09:48.370
I might have thought you'd be
in the middle of all of this.

09:48.949 --> 09:50.349
It's good to see you, too, sir.

09:50.450 --> 09:52.840
Zoe Ramos, this is Mr. Bedford,

09:52.870 --> 09:54.650
chairman of the fundraising committee.

09:54.670 --> 09:57.170
Oh, really? Just the person
I wanted to speak to, you know,

09:57.180 --> 09:59.630
I've been researching the Von Drake collection--

09:59.640 --> 10:02.140
Oh, luckily we only lost one book,
and it was the least

10:02.250 --> 10:05.050
valuable of the bunch, so,
we can still make a sale.

10:06.570 --> 10:10.370
Still combing your hair with a firecracker
I see, Dr. James.

10:11.171 --> 10:11.871
Pleasure.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.620
Likewise.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.600
He loves me. He just--

10:16.790 --> 10:18.120
he has affection issues.

10:19.921 --> 10:21.221
You were very brave.

10:21.460 --> 10:23.980
Well, you know, you don't think in
situations like that.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.600
You just act, you know.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.550
He's wrong about that book.

10:28.950 --> 10:30.030
The one that was stolen?

10:30.090 --> 10:32.870
I've been studying it. It's very valuable.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.060
It's special.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.920
It shouldn't end up in the wrong hands.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.640
Speaking of being in the wrong hands,

10:37.960 --> 10:39.270
is it serious?

10:40.620 --> 10:42.950
- You and the lunch guy.
- Eli, please.

10:42.980 --> 10:44.960
What is it? Better table manners?

10:44.970 --> 10:47.480
Oh, no, I knew it was a bad
idea for us to reconnect.

10:47.490 --> 10:49.300
We said we should keep our distance
when we broke up,

10:49.370 --> 10:51.400
- and we should have just stuck to that.
- Look, I know you're stressed out...

10:51.410 --> 10:53.290
Damn right I'm stressed!
Do you know that the school

10:53.300 --> 10:55.450
is selling the entire Von Drake collection?

10:55.480 --> 10:57.590
These are books that I have spent years studying!

10:57.600 --> 10:59.670
Hey, I hear you. Ok.

11:00.850 --> 11:02.860
So, let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.540
That's you hearing me?
Inviting me on a date?

11:05.580 --> 11:08.260
No! That's me telling you,
that I can be a grown-up.

11:08.461 --> 11:10.161
And we can have a platonic dinner

11:10.250 --> 11:12.010
and learn to just be friends.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.020
Come on, I'll take you to a terrible restaurant

11:14.049 --> 11:16.549
with bad lighting and no atmosphere.

11:16.650 --> 11:17.770
It'll be great. Huh?

11:20.660 --> 11:22.050
Well, I'm really glad you're all right.

11:22.060 --> 11:24.550
If that had been me, I would have
screamed and frozen in place.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.220
Well, you never know how you're gonna...

11:28.030 --> 11:29.010
Anyway,

11:29.169 --> 11:31.269
point is, he only got away
with one book.

11:31.470 --> 11:32.860
A valuable book, according to Zoe.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.430
There was a book in my dream.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.870
The kittens had a book?

11:37.190 --> 11:38.780
I'm way past the kittens.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.440
No, this was a little girl with no face,

11:40.450 --> 11:42.870
And she kept showing me a book--
leather, old, bound.

11:43.720 --> 11:44.970
Just like the one that was stolen.

11:44.980 --> 11:47.010
And not only that, but right after
the last time that I saw you,

11:47.029 --> 11:48.629
I saw one of those watchers.

11:48.730 --> 11:50.840
And he said that my future was in her hands.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.100
- Whose hands?
- I don't know.

11:52.140 --> 11:54.320
My kid's? I mean, could this be
connected in some way?

11:54.330 --> 11:55.910
what was in that book that was stolen.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.450
I was too much in a jealous rage
to really follow up.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.770
I'm having dinner with Zoe tonight,
though. I'll find out more.

12:02.080 --> 12:02.980
- Dinner?
- Yeah,

12:03.010 --> 12:04.250
but it's just to prove that,

12:04.255 --> 12:06.155
we can spend meaningless time together.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.770
Oh, wow, that sounds great.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.880
Well, good news.

12:09.909 --> 12:11.809
I've managed to rearrange the entire floor plan

12:11.810 --> 12:12.950
to accommodate the orchestra.

12:12.970 --> 12:15.070
Orchestra? I thought I had a DJ.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.100
You have such a quirky sense of humor.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.640
But the problem remains of getting
you in and out of the church.

12:20.710 --> 12:22.340
- Problem?
- Musically speaking.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.610
But the solution came to me on my way here.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.820
It was a message... from Cupid.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.990
I have one word for you-- Bagpipes.

12:42.660 --> 12:45.170
<i>Hey, it's Zoe. You know what to do, so do it.</i>

12:46.050 --> 12:48.190
So I guess being 45 minutes late

12:48.199 --> 12:51.199
is part of the zero romance policy we're pursuing.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.300
Zoe?

13:00.460 --> 13:02.130
<i>Not now, go away.</i>

13:02.460 --> 13:04.570
Are you all right? Let me in.

13:04.890 --> 13:06.640
<i>Everything's changed.</i>

13:07.320 --> 13:08.730
What are you talking about?

13:09.540 --> 13:10.750
Let me in!

13:10.860 --> 13:13.310
<i>I'm sorry. It's just I'm in a totally
different place right now.</i>

13:13.320 --> 13:15.760
<i>Can you just come back later or something?</i>

13:16.280 --> 13:17.940
Is there someone in there with you?

13:18.090 --> 13:20.030
<i>I need to be by myself right now.</i>

13:40.190 --> 13:41.130
Zoe?

13:41.710 --> 13:45.120
<i>Eli, I'm all right. Just go away, please.</i>

13:46.490 --> 13:48.340
As soon as I see for myself.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.630
<i>I'm kind of confused right now.
Please just leave.</i>

14:04.030 --> 14:04.820
Zoe?

14:05.630 --> 14:07.970
<i>Why won't you just leave me alone?!</i>

14:07.990 --> 14:09.990
- No!
- Eli, just go.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.400
Please, just go.

14:19.670 --> 14:22.450
Eli, please, this has nothing to do with you.
Just walk out the door.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.430
Eli, please, just leave.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.440
- Come on, let's go.
- I didn't touch her, I swear!

14:31.580 --> 14:33.780
I don't even know how I got here!

14:42.510 --> 14:45.920
Do you have any reason to believe
that Zoe knew the intruder?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.560
I don't think so,

14:49.061 --> 14:52.061
Zoe didn't see him when he broke in the library.

14:53.210 --> 14:54.730
What do you think happened?

14:54.831 --> 14:57.931
Well the intruder claims that Zoe
was coming down the stairs.

14:57.950 --> 15:00.840
She freaked when she saw
him and lost her footing.

15:02.490 --> 15:04.740
This can't be happening. I think...

15:04.840 --> 15:06.840
I'm waiting for her to just come in,

15:07.050 --> 15:09.190
and just say it was all a joke. I--

15:09.840 --> 15:11.490
Look, get some rest, all right?

15:11.499 --> 15:13.299
If I need anything else, I'll call you.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.280
She's here.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.490
Is there anything that you want to
say to Eli before you cross over?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.670
I can't cross over.

15:28.770 --> 15:29.740
Why not?

15:30.140 --> 15:33.470
I know what I have to do now,
and I can't go until it's done.

15:35.540 --> 15:37.990
This is too much information. I gotta go home.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.040
He's just a common street thief, really.

15:49.170 --> 15:50.960
Half a dozen arrests for breaking and entering.

15:51.010 --> 15:53.040
There are warrants out for him
in several other counties.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.800
I'm glad he's off the streets.

15:54.860 --> 15:56.790
Yeah, this arrest is going to solve a lot of cases.

15:56.810 --> 15:59.850
We're waiting for the public defender's office
to send someone over to represent him.

15:59.860 --> 16:01.570
- Did Eli tell you what I wanted?
- Yeah.

16:01.820 --> 16:04.920
Look, it's a little unusual,
but Eli's helped us on a lot of cases

16:04.979 --> 16:06.579
so I'm happy to do the favor.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.300
Just know that when I say 5 minutes, I mean it.

16:10.110 --> 16:10.810
Got it.

16:11.210 --> 16:13.940
I heard you say you didn't know
how you got to that house.

16:14.150 --> 16:17.370
I don't. It was the same thing with the library.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.820
It's like I don't have any say in it,

16:19.860 --> 16:21.910
like I was sleepwalking or something.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.810
What were you doing at the house?
What were you trying to steal?

16:24.850 --> 16:26.870
I wasn't trying to steal anything!

16:26.890 --> 16:28.040
Look, I know that it can be hard to--

16:28.060 --> 16:30.290
I wasn't supposed to take anything.

16:31.470 --> 16:33.470
I was supposed to put something there.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.540
What?

16:44.110 --> 16:46.320
I got nothing else to say.

16:49.447 --> 16:52.047
<i>Hey, it's Zoe. You know what to do, so do it.</i>

16:53.650 --> 16:55.230
I don't know if you're listening...

16:56.460 --> 16:57.840
If you're still here.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.790
I feel like I have so many things
I want to say I'm sorry for.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.819
And if I could just see you, just hear you,

17:05.980 --> 17:07.640
just one more time,

17:08.769 --> 17:11.269
Even if it's just to say good-Bye,

17:13.270 --> 17:14.589
I would just...

17:20.940 --> 17:22.720
What are you doing? Eli!

17:23.490 --> 17:26.200
You put people on medication
for doing things like this.

17:27.619 --> 17:28.310
<i>Sir,</i>

17:28.549 --> 17:30.349
<i>excuse me, is the library up ahead?</i>

17:30.350 --> 17:31.730
<i>Yeah, sure, it's right down here, you'll see it.</i>

17:31.850 --> 17:32.940
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

17:44.441 --> 17:47.441
<i>- Mr. Bedford, good to see you again.
- It's my pleasure.</i>

17:49.942 --> 17:52.442
<i>- So how is everything coming along?
- Good.</i>

17:54.043 --> 17:56.043
<i>I see you got everything you need here.</i>

17:58.244 --> 17:59.244
<i>I will, you, too.</i>

18:04.796 --> 18:05.996
Mr. Bedford...

18:06.198 --> 18:07.398
Who is that guy?

18:08.099 --> 18:09.799
That guy is Jeremy Bishop.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.220
He represents the collector

18:11.250 --> 18:13.580
who is buying the entire Von Drake collection,

18:13.750 --> 18:15.310
which is saving our bacon.

18:15.330 --> 18:17.790
And the check that he's writing
will help keep you paid

18:17.830 --> 18:19.430
for the next 2 semesters.

18:19.510 --> 18:21.810
I don't think I needed that exact example,

18:21.811 --> 18:23.611
but, ok.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.740
Try not to touch anything.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.080
Yeah.

18:31.681 --> 18:33.381
So you really think this thief doesn't know why

18:33.410 --> 18:35.330
he broke in the library or Zoe's?

18:35.340 --> 18:37.430
He described it as sleepwalking.

18:37.510 --> 18:38.580
Wait, you don't think that...

18:38.590 --> 18:40.510
A ghost could be controlling him? Could be.

18:40.611 --> 18:43.711
But why? Why steal that book?
Why break into Zoe's?

18:44.230 --> 18:46.790
He said he felt like he was meant
to put something there.

18:46.810 --> 18:47.680
- The book?
- Yeah.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.209
The book is the one common thread.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.112
I mean, my dream, zoe, the thief.

18:51.117 --> 18:52.817
And I just found out the guy
Zoe was having lunch

18:52.830 --> 18:55.330
with is buying the whole Von Drake
collection from the University.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.690
Yeah, see, why would she be having lunch
with the guy who took her books away?

18:58.800 --> 19:00.620
I mean, how is he connected in all this?

19:00.630 --> 19:01.890
We gotta talk to Zoe.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.080
I can't get her to come to me.

19:05.910 --> 19:07.290
Do you think she crossed over?

19:07.310 --> 19:09.280
No, but I haven't seen her either. Listen,

19:09.610 --> 19:12.810
if we don't find Zoe, we have to find that book.

19:13.590 --> 19:14.690
I know that look.

19:15.200 --> 19:18.310
That's the "we gotta sneak into some
place we don't belong" look.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.310
We shouldn't be breaking into Zoe's house.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.620
Zoe won't mind.

19:24.350 --> 19:25.670
What if we get caught?

19:25.920 --> 19:27.750
Well, I'll let you do all the talking.

19:35.270 --> 19:36.840
Where'd you learn how to do that?

19:36.840 --> 19:39.650
What, you think just because I'm an
academic I don't have any other skills?

19:40.590 --> 19:42.880
Evidently you don't know me very well.

19:50.830 --> 19:53.590
Evidently the door was open the entire time.

19:53.619 --> 19:54.819
Well, I loosened it.

19:59.649 --> 20:02.349
Guess there's no bonus miles for
breaking and entering.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.750
Where do we start?

20:04.951 --> 20:07.451
It would have to be somewhere on
the first floor. He never got upstairs.

20:13.450 --> 20:14.630
What do we do?

20:14.670 --> 20:15.720
- Grab him.
- What?!

20:15.790 --> 20:17.340
Whoever the guy is, he might have answers.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.149
Just grab him like you did the guy in the library.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.800
Listen, about the guy in the library,
it wasn't so much

20:20.820 --> 20:22.010
- I grabbed him--
- Eli, just go.

21:05.349 --> 21:07.849
Zoe was begging me.

21:07.950 --> 21:09.650
Not to buy the Von Drake collection,

21:09.650 --> 21:12.480
or at least, let the book
stay at the University,

21:12.520 --> 21:14.320
so she could continue her research.

21:14.460 --> 21:16.200
So that's what that lunch was about.

21:16.239 --> 21:17.239
So what did you tell her?

21:17.240 --> 21:18.470
I told her I'd think about it.

21:18.499 --> 21:20.399
So what, you were just gonna string her along?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.290
It was a good excuse to see her again.

21:24.330 --> 21:25.380
So shoot me.

21:25.420 --> 21:26.950
What are you doing here?

21:26.970 --> 21:28.700
Well, when someone tried to steal the books,

21:28.710 --> 21:30.680
I thought maybe Zoe was behind it.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.030
You actually think Zoe would
stoop to stealing books?

21:33.540 --> 21:34.470
She was a professor.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.190
Said the professor who just
broke into Zoe's house,

21:37.200 --> 21:39.550
Looking for the same thing I am, I am sure.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.390
The missing book.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.930
Seems we all thought it was here.

21:41.939 --> 21:43.739
You know, I thought it was
the least valuable one,

21:43.840 --> 21:46.630
So why would you risk breaking
and entering just to find it?

21:46.640 --> 21:47.810
Why would you?

21:49.120 --> 21:52.200
There are many different
definitions of valuable.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.640
The people that I work
for want the complete set.

21:54.650 --> 21:56.410
Who exactly do you work for?

21:57.840 --> 21:58.740
Privileged.

21:59.170 --> 22:01.670
So, do we call the police on each other,

22:01.680 --> 22:03.640
or do we all just walk away?

22:05.070 --> 22:07.430
I'd go for the walk away thing.

22:13.780 --> 22:14.780
Zoe...

22:15.881 --> 22:17.481
Please don't hide from me.

22:17.810 --> 22:19.270
We need to talk.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.680
- Please?
- I'm here.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.740
You know, just because I'm an
insecure, jealous maniac,

22:28.750 --> 22:30.310
is no reason to ignore me.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.670
I came because you almost got hurt tonight.

22:34.530 --> 22:35.780
You need to step away from this.

22:35.790 --> 22:37.670
You'll understand everything someday.

22:37.771 --> 22:39.671
I need to know now, Zoe.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.430
What's in that book?

22:41.540 --> 22:42.710
Where is it?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.510
The book is the key to everything.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.640
The book is always changing--

22:45.650 --> 22:47.850
New things are written,
old things are erased.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.500
You still there?

22:56.901 --> 22:58.401
There's others here.

23:01.060 --> 23:04.260
There are so many things on this side,
that I don't understand yet.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.620
Yeah, well, it's not much better
on this side, I can tell you that.

23:11.170 --> 23:12.750
The book taught me what I have to do.

23:13.751 --> 23:15.051
Who I have to help.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.570
When the time comes, I'll be there to guide you.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.030
Guide me where?

23:20.531 --> 23:23.331
You didn't have to apologize for not believing me.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.440
I knew you didn't.

23:25.850 --> 23:26.910
It wasn't that, I--

23:26.911 --> 23:28.011
You listened to me.

23:29.220 --> 23:30.780
Even though you didn't believe...

23:33.110 --> 23:34.530
That's what I loved.

23:37.930 --> 23:39.410
Zoe, I miss you.

23:58.170 --> 24:01.280
Excuse me, but did you just
say horse and carriage?

24:01.481 --> 24:03.081
Breathtaking, isn't it?

24:03.140 --> 24:06.640
The entire wedding party arrive at the
reception hall by horse and carriage.

24:06.650 --> 24:08.890
The whole thing just drips romance.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.350
If I know I say it myself.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.970
I know that you're an artist,

24:11.971 --> 24:13.071
- but really--
- Please, there's no need

24:13.080 --> 24:15.020
to state the obvious,
but thank you.

24:15.030 --> 24:17.400
Now, your mother has called and announced

24:17.410 --> 24:21.200
that another family contingent are
flying in from vermont-Cousins.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.809
Half a dozen. Well, six to be exact.

24:22.910 --> 24:23.860
But don't worry.

24:23.869 --> 24:25.569
We need a bigger reception hall anyway.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.970
We simply cannot fit a decent-sized
arbor in this space.

24:28.070 --> 24:29.060
It's impossible.

24:29.070 --> 24:31.730
You know what, I have to go get
something from the basement.

24:34.150 --> 24:34.940
Ok.

24:34.980 --> 24:37.330
Now, the rooftop is available
at the Sunset Manor, but then

24:37.335 --> 24:40.020
there are weather worries,
and the carpet there's just dreadful.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.130
What do you want?

24:47.180 --> 24:48.470
You can't.

24:50.371 --> 24:51.671
Can't what?

24:52.480 --> 24:53.800
Save her.

24:55.750 --> 24:56.940
You can't.

25:01.910 --> 25:02.620
Look...

25:03.121 --> 25:04.921
You're in a fair amount of trouble,

25:05.622 --> 25:06.822
but I can help you.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.670
The people I work for have
a lot of resources.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.350
We can get you a decent attorney,

25:11.360 --> 25:13.050
maybe even arrange bail.

25:14.151 --> 25:15.151
How?

25:15.360 --> 25:17.230
Before I can help you,

25:17.831 --> 25:19.631
I have to know one thing.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.810
- Where's the book?
- The what?

25:23.820 --> 25:25.930
The book you took from the library.

25:25.970 --> 25:28.820
Did you put it in the woman's
house, did you hide it somewhere?

25:28.830 --> 25:31.230
Dude, I don't even know
how I got in that house.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.410
Why won't anyone believe me?

25:34.020 --> 25:36.510
Maybe it's because you're a low-life thief.

25:39.430 --> 25:40.590
Look at me.

25:42.740 --> 25:44.180
Look at my eyes.

25:45.770 --> 25:47.110
Now think.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.810
Remember.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.130
Think harder.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.970
We're not letting you
anywhere near that book.

26:10.030 --> 26:11.990
You're overmatched.

26:21.791 --> 26:23.491
Do you really think you can stop us

26:23.500 --> 26:25.300
with marionette tricks?

26:52.435 --> 26:53.535
You all right?

26:53.636 --> 26:54.836
Not really.

26:57.037 --> 27:00.637
Melinda, tell me, these visions you're having,
they're all of a little girl, right?

27:00.730 --> 27:03.580
I just know this is about our baby,
I just know it.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.000
No, Mel, it's not.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.700
It's not, trust me.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.280
What makes you so sure?

27:13.320 --> 27:15.060
What are you not telling me?

27:16.920 --> 27:17.820
Look, are you sure you want to know?

27:17.890 --> 27:20.050
Don't mess with me right now, please.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.400
Our child is not going to be a she.

27:26.919 --> 27:28.719
We're gonna have a little boy.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.130
- You know?
- Yeah.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.240
How? I thought that we were gonna-

27:34.340 --> 27:36.690
I know, I didn't do it on purpose, but...

27:37.100 --> 27:39.140
I found a little note attached
to your last sonogram.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.320
and I wasn't going to tell you, but--

27:40.370 --> 27:42.140
- A boy?
- yeah.

27:59.870 --> 28:01.180
Who's the "she"?

28:04.160 --> 28:07.690
Who holds my future in her hands,
who is it that I can't save?

28:33.543 --> 28:35.343
I really miss pizza.

28:36.745 --> 28:38.145
Pizza made me happy.

28:38.446 --> 28:39.446
Who is that?!

28:39.848 --> 28:40.948
I need your help.

28:41.549 --> 28:43.649
You've really got to find that book

28:43.750 --> 28:45.350
before Jeremy Bishop does.

28:45.410 --> 28:47.310
Yeah, well, it's not like we haven't been trying.

28:48.130 --> 28:49.960
- Who are you?
- Not important.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.470
Are you one of the watchers?

28:51.480 --> 28:54.060
That sounds so pretensions.
Just call me Carl.

28:54.370 --> 28:56.820
Carl. Yeah, I remember you.

28:57.430 --> 28:58.840
Carl the watcher.

28:59.150 --> 29:00.930
Did you have to come when
I was in my underwear, Carl?

29:00.940 --> 29:01.980
Don't worry about it.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.840
Since I've been dead, I've walked in on lots worse.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.160
Who's this Jeremy guy anyway?

29:07.170 --> 29:08.700
It's not so much about Jeremy

29:08.710 --> 29:11.120
as who controls him and what they want.

29:11.330 --> 29:13.380
The book has been safe up to now

29:13.390 --> 29:16.280
because it was hidden in the larger collection.

29:16.290 --> 29:18.080
But then Jeremy found out about it?

29:18.090 --> 29:21.070
Yes, and he was sent to buy the collection.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.080
So I took control of that repulsive little thief,

29:24.090 --> 29:25.740
and made him steal the book

29:25.750 --> 29:29.440
and then I made him put it in Zoe's house.

29:29.449 --> 29:31.549
I was improvising.

29:31.650 --> 29:33.450
Wait, I thought watchers weren't supposed to--

29:33.551 --> 29:35.051
Interfere. True.

29:35.452 --> 29:38.552
And there was a reprimand involved,

29:38.650 --> 29:39.790
believe me.

29:39.800 --> 29:42.790
Apparently we're supposed to give
warnings, clues,

29:42.800 --> 29:45.790
but not really affect the future ourselves,

29:45.800 --> 29:47.950
just influence others.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.210
So you influenced a thief to steal the book.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.570
Why did you pick this particular thief?

29:53.980 --> 29:57.960
It's not so hard to find these lost souls.

29:58.150 --> 30:01.280
That, and he was about to break into
my wife's house for the second time

30:01.290 --> 30:03.130
and I can't have that, so,

30:03.531 --> 30:06.031
2 birds, one stone kind of thing.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.760
Well, I'm sorry.

30:08.061 --> 30:09.461
I don't know where the book is.

30:09.662 --> 30:10.662
I do.

30:11.370 --> 30:14.830
I'll tell you where the book is,
but you have to promise me

30:14.840 --> 30:17.020
that you'll keep it safe. And one other thing--

30:17.530 --> 30:21.900
Melinda can't touch the book or even see it.

30:21.910 --> 30:23.250
Well, how am I supposed to do that?

30:23.560 --> 30:25.140
I can't lie to Melinda.

30:25.150 --> 30:25.950
Eli...

30:26.960 --> 30:29.410
If this stuff was easy,

30:30.111 --> 30:31.811
anybody could do it.

32:02.012 --> 32:03.212
Sorry to crash your party,

32:03.213 --> 32:04.913
but they're not gonna turn on me
just because I'm a man, are they?

32:04.915 --> 32:06.015
What are you doing here?

32:06.016 --> 32:08.216
I've got some good news and bad news,
and neither can wait.

32:08.318 --> 32:09.818
Ok, so what's the good news?

32:09.820 --> 32:11.370
- I found the book.
- That's great.

32:11.671 --> 32:13.071
What's the bad news?

32:15.540 --> 32:17.060
What do you mean, I can't see the book?

32:17.070 --> 32:19.100
- Or touch it, technically.
- Excuse me?

32:19.310 --> 32:20.310
Look, I don't know why,

32:20.320 --> 32:22.470
but Carl the reluctant watcher made me promise.

32:22.771 --> 32:25.771
The thing is, I looked at the
book last night and at its names,

32:25.850 --> 32:28.520
and there was something
really scary under Zoe's name.

32:28.950 --> 32:30.190
But you can't show me?

32:30.200 --> 32:30.720
No.

32:30.721 --> 32:31.921
Next best thing.

32:32.622 --> 32:33.722
I scanned the page.

32:33.730 --> 32:35.490
I figure you can read it without seeing the book.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.990
Carl may not approve, but he doesn't seem like

32:37.000 --> 32:38.440
a letter of the law type of ghost.

32:38.450 --> 32:39.590
What are these numbers?

32:39.640 --> 32:40.600
No idea.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.760
But look at this.

32:45.570 --> 32:47.900
<i><b>She helps the listener join the dead. </b></i>

32:49.040 --> 32:50.020
You're the listener?

32:50.130 --> 32:50.850
Yeah!

32:51.251 --> 32:53.151
What does that mean?
I'm marked for death or something?

32:53.230 --> 32:54.440
We don't know that for sure.

32:54.441 --> 32:55.641
That's why Zoe's not crossing over.

32:55.642 --> 32:58.142
She knows I'm gonna die soon, and
she's here to help me cross over.

32:58.160 --> 32:58.810
Ok.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.460
Hey, Mel, there's still a couple more gifts to open.

33:01.470 --> 33:02.200
Ok.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.570
Please just stay calm, all right?

33:04.580 --> 33:05.890
I'll only be a few minutes.

33:06.391 --> 33:08.491
Don't go anywhere, I'm not going
to let you out of my sight.

33:10.190 --> 33:12.060
All right, here's the next one.

33:12.100 --> 33:12.790
Ok!

33:14.400 --> 33:15.900
Oh, you guys, baby names!

33:15.910 --> 33:17.360
That's great, 'cause we have no clue

33:17.364 --> 33:19.064
what the baby's name is going to be.

33:42.490 --> 33:43.810
- Where's the book?
- In my office.

33:43.811 --> 33:45.811
- I need to see it right now!
- But the watcher said--

33:45.812 --> 33:47.112
Don't give me the watcher crap, all right?

33:47.213 --> 33:48.813
Just take me to the book or I'll hurt you.

34:08.023 --> 34:09.623
Who is sending you these messages?

34:09.627 --> 34:11.827
I don't know. The watchers, my unconscious...

34:11.830 --> 34:12.820
They could be from the baby.

34:13.129 --> 34:14.429
I don't even want to go there.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.690
Look, if my baby is in danger, I have to know it.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.150
What?

34:47.351 --> 34:49.150
I think I know what's going on here.

34:50.351 --> 34:52.152
Andrea 2804,

34:52.253 --> 34:54.553
Eli 310, Jim 711,

34:54.560 --> 34:57.470
Sam 1411, Zoe 1505.

34:58.420 --> 35:00.390
There are all dates, they're just backwards.

35:00.591 --> 35:01.891
Dates for what?

35:03.492 --> 35:06.192
April 28th, Andrea died in that plane crash.

35:08.900 --> 35:11.050
You were hurt in the fire October 3rd.

35:15.070 --> 35:17.330
Jim died November 7th.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.260
<i>No!</i>

35:22.330 --> 35:26.000
And Sam died November 14th,
and Zoe, May 15th.

35:35.651 --> 35:36.951
What does it mean?

35:37.152 --> 35:38.552
The book of changes.

35:39.053 --> 35:40.553
This book isn't about the future,

35:40.559 --> 35:42.159
this book is about the past.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.180
Every one of these names is a normal person

35:44.190 --> 35:46.190
who died and came back in one way or another.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.410
Who's keeping track of it and why?

35:47.420 --> 35:49.540
I don't know. The watchers, maybe?

35:50.241 --> 35:51.041
Melinda...

35:52.042 --> 35:53.742
There's one more page you need to see.

35:53.950 --> 35:56.200
It's probably why you weren't
supposed to see the book.

36:01.290 --> 36:02.690
September 25th.

36:02.700 --> 36:04.120
What happened on that day?

36:05.021 --> 36:06.621
This one is about the future.

36:07.022 --> 36:07.922
What?

36:11.510 --> 36:12.930
My due date.

36:14.010 --> 36:15.490
September 25th.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.970
Zoe, I have to talk to you. Please.

36:20.250 --> 36:22.110
It's never been more important.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.430
It's not about me or you.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.390
It's about Melinda's baby.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.690
She's scared.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.780
You've got to tell me what you know.

36:30.490 --> 36:33.880
Tell Melinda the other side is giving
her those visions, to try to scare her.

36:33.890 --> 36:35.660
They want the child to be scared, too.

36:35.670 --> 36:36.510
The other side?

36:36.610 --> 36:39.620
If I knew more, I would tell you, but there's
so many things I haven't figured out yet.

36:39.930 --> 36:41.950
You don't have to figure out
anything anymore.

36:42.460 --> 36:43.650
You can cross over.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.430
No, I have to help you.

36:46.040 --> 36:49.780
Zoe, the book says you help
the listener join the dead.

36:50.490 --> 36:51.790
But you already have.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.270
How?

36:53.280 --> 36:54.970
I did something stupid.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.950
I let myself get involved with a patient.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.230
I let it get too personal,

36:59.240 --> 37:01.510
which led me right to being in that fire,

37:02.120 --> 37:04.590
which led me directly to
being able to hear the dead.

37:06.700 --> 37:08.180
You did what you were meant to do.

37:08.190 --> 37:09.180
There's more.

37:09.290 --> 37:11.290
The book needs a caretaker.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.970
It was me for all these years
and I didn't even know it.

37:15.680 --> 37:16.540
And now?

37:17.150 --> 37:18.050
It's you.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.890
But you can't keep the book in one place.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.220
Now that they know it's here,
they'll never stop looking.

37:22.230 --> 37:23.060
Who?

37:23.070 --> 37:25.350
They're different faces all the
time, but they're always there.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.100
Zoe, I'll take care of the book.

37:30.910 --> 37:32.470
You're free now, Zoe.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.250
You can cross over.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.420
I don't feel right leaving you.

37:40.830 --> 37:42.770
But you were right to leave me before.

37:42.780 --> 37:44.110
And you're right now.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.550
And you're leaving a lot of good behind.

37:47.060 --> 37:48.110
I'm not.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.760
I haven't had time to do anything...

37:51.570 --> 37:52.640
To finish anything.

37:52.650 --> 37:53.640
You're wrong.

37:53.650 --> 37:55.140
Look how you helped me.

37:55.750 --> 37:57.880
You taught me how to care about somebody.

37:58.590 --> 38:01.920
Even if I was all awkward and stupid about it.

38:03.230 --> 38:05.860
And you showed me that maybe
somebody could care about me.

38:06.970 --> 38:07.960
You know, in a way like

38:07.970 --> 38:11.060
I always wanted to be cared about
but never thought I would.

38:15.540 --> 38:16.940
That's kinda huge.

38:36.260 --> 38:37.290
You gone?

38:44.060 --> 38:45.380
But not forgotten.

38:50.217 --> 38:51.317
Carl?

38:52.419 --> 38:53.519
Are you here?

38:54.820 --> 38:56.510
I really need to talk to you.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.440
I didn't know where else to look.

39:01.170 --> 39:02.880
I want some answers.

39:03.130 --> 39:04.840
I know the feeling.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.830
I understand now.

39:07.931 --> 39:10.431
That it was Zoe who held
my future in her hands

39:10.470 --> 39:12.100
because she knew what was in the book.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.990
Which you were not supposed to read.

39:14.291 --> 39:15.491
So sue me.

39:16.140 --> 39:18.250
Look, I'm not asking for anything for myself,

39:18.300 --> 39:20.390
but I do need to know if my baby is in danger.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.320
I am not supposed to tell you too much.

39:23.330 --> 39:25.070
I've already had my wrists slapped.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.290
You owe me, Carl.

39:26.391 --> 39:28.791
When you were being haunted,
I helped you find peace.

39:28.800 --> 39:32.670
All I can tell you, Melinda, is that
you have to prepare your child.

39:32.780 --> 39:35.750
Don't let the other side scare you into
shielding him,

39:35.760 --> 39:38.000
but you must teach him.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.470
There's a lot of white light around you.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.030
Many spirits watching over you.

39:43.040 --> 39:46.220
More than you know,
but one tear in the curtain,

39:46.230 --> 39:47.800
and the balance could shift.

39:48.210 --> 39:49.760
And your son is the key.

39:50.670 --> 39:53.160
Will my son be able to do what I do?

39:53.170 --> 39:54.030
No.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.320
Ok.

39:56.330 --> 39:58.230
Well, that's a relief.

39:58.531 --> 40:01.731
He'll be able to do much, much more.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.340
That takes care of the bridesmaids.

40:12.641 --> 40:14.841
Now, on to the orchestra samples.

40:14.899 --> 40:17.899
Take your time listening to them,
but I need your choice by 7:00.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.320
Now, can we talk about the ice sculpture?

40:23.570 --> 40:27.340
Imagine this 50 times as big.

40:28.850 --> 40:29.860
Excuse me.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.040
Can you come with me?

40:33.780 --> 40:35.400
- Hello?
- Delia, you, too.

40:35.780 --> 40:38.740
Hello? We're just trying to design
the wedding of the decade here.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.420
<i>I haven't even spoken
about the fireworks yet!</i>

40:41.430 --> 40:42.950
- So what are we doing?
- You know what?

40:43.160 --> 40:44.800
Melinda, you were right.

40:45.430 --> 40:46.980
No matter how big this wedding gets,

40:47.010 --> 40:49.760
in the end, it is still only about--

40:51.670 --> 40:52.430
you and me.

41:12.101 --> 41:13.501
You recognize the street?

41:14.303 --> 41:15.503
Yes.

41:16.405 --> 41:18.205
It's the street where we first met.

41:35.270 --> 41:36.730
You know, this wedding...

41:37.350 --> 41:39.350
This marriage is just about us.

41:39.451 --> 41:42.751
It's not about your mom, or,
you know, our relatives or

41:42.952 --> 41:44.352
the ice sculpture.

41:45.910 --> 41:47.380
It's just you and me.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.160
The way it's always been.

41:50.761 --> 41:53.361
Well, I mean, almost the
way it's always been.

41:56.060 --> 41:59.480
But I've always been married
to you, Melinda Gordon.

42:00.220 --> 42:03.040
No matter what comes between us,
and I always will be.

42:05.070 --> 42:07.030
No matter what's waiting for us.

42:09.770 --> 42:11.870
And no matter what we can't foresee.

42:12.640 --> 42:13.850
I promise you.

42:28.550 --> 42:30.200
You're unbelievable.

42:33.701 --> 42:34.901
This isn't a wedding.

42:35.502 --> 42:36.702
This is just...

42:37.120 --> 42:39.400
a renewal of what we have always had.

42:40.020 --> 42:42.170
Of what we'll never lose.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.110
And you know why?

42:50.350 --> 42:52.820
Because you can't kill love.

43:01.560 --> 43:02.710
Oh, hey, maid of honor.

43:02.811 --> 43:03.611
Best man.

43:06.612 --> 43:07.712
Let's do this.

43:13.913 --> 43:14.913
Dearly beloved,

43:15.814 --> 43:18.814
We are gathered here today
to join Sam and Melinda,

43:18.815 --> 43:20.815
in holy matrimony.

43:20.516 --> 43:22.716
No other human ties are more tender,

43:22.717 --> 43:24.917
no other vows more sacred

43:24.917 --> 43:27.117
than those you are about to make tonight.
