WEBVTT

00:03.770 --> 00:05.705
Mm-hmm.

00:05.705 --> 00:08.141
Is this important?

00:08.141 --> 00:09.576
It'll just take a second.

00:09.576 --> 00:12.345
Fine, but Mr. Donaghy
is on another call right now

00:12.345 --> 00:14.748
and doesn't have time for a
separate interaction with you.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.383
Everything he
says will have

00:16.383 --> 00:17.550
to work for
both conversations.

00:17.550 --> 00:18.551
Really?

00:18.551 --> 00:19.686
Lemon.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.121
"Lemon" works for your business call?

00:21.121 --> 00:22.389
Oh, right, uh...

00:22.389 --> 00:24.090
Well, I just wanted
to let you know that

00:24.090 --> 00:26.593
I have to go to Chicago for jury
duty because I never changed

00:26.593 --> 00:27.660
my residence to New York.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.062
Why not?

00:29.062 --> 00:31.765
Because I wanted to vote
in a swing state, Jack.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.533
Also, I want to stay

00:33.533 --> 00:34.734
on the mailing list at
Chicago Pizza Explosion.

00:34.734 --> 00:36.469
How fast can you turn it around?

00:36.469 --> 00:37.470
Who, me?

00:37.470 --> 00:38.505
Oh, right.

00:38.505 --> 00:39.806
Uh, I'll fly back in the morning.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.207
I never get
put on a jury.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.777
I wear my Princess Leia costume
and they dismiss me immediately.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.445
Well, that sounds good for both of us.

00:45.445 --> 00:46.613
Thank you very much, sir.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.782
Ha, that last part didn't work both ways.

00:48.782 --> 00:49.983
You said "sir."

00:49.983 --> 00:51.785
I think it worked fine.

00:51.785 --> 00:52.786
I'll have Jonathan

00:52.786 --> 00:54.454
call Travel and upgrade your flight.

00:54.454 --> 00:55.455
Sweet!

00:55.455 --> 00:56.723
What do you
take to fly?

00:56.723 --> 00:58.324
Candy and magazines.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.826
No, pills.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.694
Nobody flies without medication anymore.

01:01.694 --> 01:04.596
Why shouldn't you enjoy
the same luxuries as a dog?

01:04.596 --> 01:07.088
"Comanapracil"?

01:08.601 --> 01:11.104
"May cause dizziness, sexual
nightmares and sleep crime."

01:11.104 --> 01:12.366
It's very good.

01:14.607 --> 01:15.875
Tyler Brody on two, sir.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.078
Tyler Brody, the dude from the Olympics?

01:18.078 --> 01:20.680
Yes, he was the silver
medalist in tetherball.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.482
Speedman's caught an angle!

01:22.482 --> 01:23.583
Tyler Brody is flailing!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.852
And there's the coil!

01:25.852 --> 01:27.720
Lance Speedman is the Olympic
Tetherball Champion...

01:27.720 --> 01:30.490
and Tyler Brody can't believe it!

01:30.490 --> 01:33.660
Boy, there are a lot of weird
Olympic events these days.

01:33.660 --> 01:37.464
Not that weird, Lemon.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.299
Tetherball, we faked.

01:39.299 --> 01:40.767
What? Why would you fake an Olympic event?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.168
For ratings.

01:42.168 --> 01:45.505
We staged several events so that
Americans could win more medals.

01:45.505 --> 01:48.408
That's despicable.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.643
It took years of planning and
now Tyler Brody

01:50.643 --> 01:52.312
is threatening to go public
and ruin everything.

01:52.312 --> 01:54.047
So obviously, I have a lot on my plate

01:54.047 --> 01:55.682
and no time to baby-sit the sixth floor.

01:55.682 --> 01:57.817
So before you go gallivanting
off to Chicago

01:57.817 --> 02:00.285
make sure you get your people under control.

02:01.654 --> 02:02.689
Be a manager.

02:02.689 --> 02:03.656
Yeah, yeah.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.095
Liz, Tracy is countersuing me!

02:09.095 --> 02:10.729
For "defamation of character."

02:10.729 --> 02:13.166
How can you "defame" someone
who's been arrested

02:13.166 --> 02:14.901
in three different Chuck E. Cheeses?

02:14.901 --> 02:17.036
Do you know who I am?!

02:17.036 --> 02:20.340
Seriously, please tell me who I am!

02:20.340 --> 02:23.076
Jenna, I'm not taking sides
in this lawsuit thing.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.310
It's ridiculous.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.345
Tracy's video game
never would have worked

02:25.345 --> 02:26.346
without my voice acting.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.381
I deserve to get paid.

02:28.381 --> 02:29.749
Liz Lemon!

02:29.749 --> 02:31.117
Nemesis.

02:31.117 --> 02:33.381
Liz, will you tell Tracy I don't
even want to speak to him?

02:34.287 --> 02:36.156
Okay, two can play at that game.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.258
Liz, could you please tell
Kenneth that Liz wants him?

02:38.258 --> 02:40.059
That's not even...
Okay, that's it.

02:40.059 --> 02:42.095
I am calling Human Resources

02:42.095 --> 02:43.596
and setting up a mediation for you.

02:43.596 --> 02:46.966
I told you, I don't
drink that much at work.

02:46.966 --> 02:49.230
Mediation is a binding form of
non-judicial dispute resolution.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.505
I watched "Boston Legal" nine
times before I realized

02:52.505 --> 02:54.073
it wasn't a new "Star Trek."

02:54.073 --> 02:57.443
Liz, you have to admit
this is unfair.

02:57.443 --> 02:58.745
I got nothing.

02:58.745 --> 03:01.614
Meanwhile, Grizz and
Dotcom bought a boat.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.883
Cape Hatteras is lovely
this time of year.

03:03.883 --> 03:06.920
Well, of course Tracy takes
care of his boys and not you.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.054
He thinks he can

03:08.054 --> 03:09.622
take advantage of you
because you're a woman.

03:09.622 --> 03:12.325
Men think they can get
away with anything.

03:12.325 --> 03:13.993
It's like when Adrien Brody
kissed Halle Berry

03:13.993 --> 03:15.261
at the Oscars.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.763
No one has it harder in this
country today than women.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.731
It turns out we can't be president.

03:18.731 --> 03:21.167
We can't be network news anchors.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.770
Madonna's arms
look crazy.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.772
Tyler, I know you're upset we
didn't pick you for the gold

03:25.772 --> 03:27.373
and I'm going to
make it up to you.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.676
How would you like to
host "Deal or No Deal"

03:29.676 --> 03:31.778
in the privacy of your own home?

03:31.778 --> 03:33.279
I think I'll hold a press
conference instead...

03:33.279 --> 03:36.942
tell the world there's no such
thing as Olympic tetherball.

03:38.618 --> 03:41.154
...or synchronized running.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.089
Or octuples tennis!

03:43.089 --> 03:44.357
It's all a lie.

03:44.357 --> 03:45.959
A white lie that
did a lot of good

03:45.959 --> 03:47.256
for this country's morale.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.729
Did you know that
President Bush's approval rating

03:49.729 --> 03:51.798
was almost as high as 15%
following the Olympics?

03:51.798 --> 03:56.035
Gasp! Olympic hero Tyler Brody!

03:56.035 --> 03:57.637
Olympic fraud!

03:57.637 --> 04:00.340
There's no such thing as Olympic tetherball.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.175
They made it all up for the ratings.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.144
What are you saying?

04:05.144 --> 04:06.279
Tyler...

04:06.279 --> 04:08.648
You can be the voice of "Knight Rider..."

04:08.648 --> 04:11.751
the film!

04:11.751 --> 04:13.776
I'm listening.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:35.842 --> 04:39.712
Okay, I'm Jeffrey, I am a mediator.

04:39.712 --> 04:43.449
And you two are having
a dispute, now why is that?

04:43.449 --> 04:44.684
Because Tracy thinks he can
treat me unfairly

04:44.684 --> 04:46.219
because I'm a woman.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.720
What?! Please.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.222
We're here because white folks
think they can do

04:49.222 --> 04:51.057
whatever they want to do to black folks.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.292
It's like when Adrien Brody
kissed Halle Berry

04:52.292 --> 04:53.493
at the Oscars.

04:53.493 --> 04:56.329
White people stole
jazz, rock-n-roll

04:56.329 --> 04:58.698
Will Smith and heart disease.

04:58.698 --> 04:59.899
Now they think

04:59.899 --> 05:01.134
they can take my hard-earned money.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.802
Okay, well, if we look at how voice actors

05:02.802 --> 05:04.037
are normally compensated...

05:04.037 --> 05:05.571
Liz says,
in today's America

05:05.571 --> 05:07.206
it's harder to be
a woman than a black man.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.975
Liz Lemon? That chick is dumb!

05:08.975 --> 05:10.310
Okay...

05:10.310 --> 05:11.811
Tracy, do you know women still
get paid less than men

05:11.811 --> 05:13.146
for doing the same job?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.581
Do you know it's still illegal
to be black in Arizona?!

05:15.581 --> 05:17.250
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

05:17.250 --> 05:19.616
to be an overweight transgender
in this country?!

05:26.959 --> 05:29.519
No, Grandma, no...

05:35.001 --> 05:38.738
"Believe in the stars."

05:38.738 --> 05:40.740
It's like that doesn't even
mean anything anymore.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.608
Kenneth...

05:42.608 --> 05:44.610
I'm sure I can trust
your discretion about

05:44.610 --> 05:45.845
what happened in
my office today.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.613
What you overheard was some rather

05:47.613 --> 05:49.615
grown-up talk.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.684
Was any of it real,
Mr. Donaghy?

05:51.684 --> 05:54.887
Beer pong? Jazzercise?
Women's soccer?

05:54.887 --> 05:56.923
You're not in Stone Mountain
anymore, Kenneth.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.758
This is the
real world

05:58.758 --> 06:00.026
and not everything is in black and white.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.119
There's always a right thing
to do, Mr. Donaghy.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.831
Just, sometimes, it's not
the easy thing to do.

06:07.033 --> 06:11.938
Tyler Brody was not the only
hero I lost today, sir.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.707
The other hero was you,
in case that wasn't...

06:14.707 --> 06:15.696
I got it, Kenneth.

06:19.612 --> 06:22.148
If it weren't for you people,
I'd still be in Africa...

06:22.148 --> 06:24.550
gorgeous, politically
stable Africa!

06:24.550 --> 06:25.551
My people?

06:25.551 --> 06:27.320
Women are the oppressed ones.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.981
And it's even harder
being a beautiful woman.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.558
Everyone assumes I don't try
in bed, it's discrimination!

06:32.558 --> 06:35.161
Whatever, You couldn't last
one day in my shoes, Maroney!

06:35.161 --> 06:36.162
Right, Toof?

06:36.162 --> 06:37.430
No, thank you.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.965
I could totally be black.

06:38.965 --> 06:39.966
You should try
being a white woman!

06:39.966 --> 06:41.067
Okay, I will!

06:41.067 --> 06:42.168
No, no, no, no, no!

06:42.168 --> 06:43.469
I don't like where
this is heading.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.304
"Freaky Friday" social experiment!

06:45.304 --> 06:46.362
Oh, it's on!

06:47.807 --> 06:49.175
Where is Liz Lemon?

06:49.175 --> 06:51.344
I don't really think it's fair
for me to be on a jury

06:51.344 --> 06:52.745
because I can read thoughts.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.113
Dismissed!

06:54.113 --> 06:59.085
Welcome aboard
Flight 1876 to New York...

07:02.822 --> 07:04.090
Hello?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.792
Lemon, as part of our deal
to keep him quiet

07:05.792 --> 07:07.994
Tyler Brody is going to be on
your show this week.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.562
But he won't do any tetherball stuff.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.431
Boy, Jack, it must be nice to
dump your problems

07:11.431 --> 07:12.432
on other people.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.800
It is.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.601
Lemon, do you think Kenneth admires you?

07:15.601 --> 07:17.770
Sure, that kid looks up to everybody.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.639
He calls Tracy's lizard "sir."

07:19.639 --> 07:20.773
So someone would have to
be a complete monster

07:20.773 --> 07:22.008
to lose his respect.

07:22.008 --> 07:24.010
Yeah... I don't know what
we're talking about.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.578
We're talking
about nobody...

07:25.578 --> 07:27.671
a hillbilly nobody that
doesn't know anything.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.954
Hello?

07:34.954 --> 07:36.389
Tracy is a white woman, Liz.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.457
What?

07:37.457 --> 07:38.624
He's trying to prove

07:38.624 --> 07:40.593
that being a white woman is
easier than being a black man.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.595
Wait, no...
what about the mediation?

07:42.595 --> 07:43.729
We are way past that.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.898
This is gonna be bigger than
when Tyra Banks

07:45.898 --> 07:47.066
put on that fat suit.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.401
And don't worry...

07:48.401 --> 07:50.736
When I prove Tracy wrong,
you'll get all the credit.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.636
What are you
gonna do, J...?

07:57.677 --> 07:59.178
Hello?

07:59.178 --> 08:02.215
Liz, it's
Becky, your college roommate!

08:02.215 --> 08:03.249
I'm sorry, who?

08:03.249 --> 08:04.884
See, Liz Lemon?

08:04.884 --> 08:05.952
You're already treating me
with more respect.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.320
Oh, God, Tracy...

08:07.320 --> 08:08.721
You wait till I test
this noise out on society.

08:08.721 --> 08:10.857
Minds will be blown!

08:10.857 --> 08:12.191
No! No society.

08:12.191 --> 08:15.294
Do not go outside, do not
let Jack Donaghy see you!

08:15.294 --> 08:17.964
Tracis,
listen to meem... oh, boy.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.031
This pills am strong.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.100
You can't fix this, Liz Lemon!

08:21.100 --> 08:23.569
It's about race, It's about being a woman.

08:23.569 --> 08:26.105
It's about money.
It's about being on TV!

08:26.105 --> 08:29.108
And no one understands all that.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.097
Hello.

08:32.078 --> 08:36.105
I'ma call you back, I snitting nexta Borpo.

08:41.953 --> 08:45.224
Well, Portland's got a fun, little waterfront.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.262
Would you mind if I closed
this window shade...

08:49.262 --> 08:51.564
I'm trying to adopt a baby but my job

08:51.564 --> 08:52.598
is making it impossible

08:52.598 --> 08:54.000
because my Work Self

08:54.000 --> 08:56.135
is suffocating my Life Me!

08:56.135 --> 08:57.169
I'm Liz Lemon

08:57.169 --> 08:59.228
and I lost my virginity at 25.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.207
I saw the show about
following your fear

09:01.207 --> 09:03.543
and it inspired me to wear
shorts to work.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.669
It didn't go great.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.546
Do you know Tracy Jordan?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.915
I took
a pill earlier, but...

09:08.915 --> 09:10.349
I didn't get my
September issue

09:10.349 --> 09:12.943
of "O" magazine, do you have
the number for subscriptions?

09:13.819 --> 09:16.652
Why would you?! Aah!

09:17.657 --> 09:18.991
I eat emotionally.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.360
And, one time, at summer camp,
I kissed a girl on a dare

09:21.360 --> 09:22.795
but then she drowned!

09:22.795 --> 09:26.332
And here comes some more stuff,
I hate my feet.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.367
And, once, I had a sex dream
about Nate Berkus

09:28.367 --> 09:30.369
but halfway through,
he turned into Dr. Oz.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.004
Has that ever
happened to you?

09:32.004 --> 09:34.373
A hug! This is happening!

09:34.373 --> 09:35.499
It's all right, Liz,
it's all right.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.109
I'm okay.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.177
Please stay close.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.112
Uh, can you keep your hands
outside my clothes?

09:40.112 --> 09:40.846
Okay.

09:40.846 --> 09:41.813
Good.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.785
Kenneth, I'm a good person.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.386
If you say so, sir.

09:47.386 --> 09:50.189
But sometimes,
life is complicated.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.592
There isn't always a right answer.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.393
Say you're in a lifeboat...

09:54.393 --> 09:56.028
"You're in a lifeboat."

09:56.028 --> 10:00.566
The boat holds eight people...
but you have nine onboard.

10:00.566 --> 10:01.901
Either you will capsize

10:01.901 --> 10:03.836
and everyone will drown
or one person can be

10:03.836 --> 10:05.771
sacrificed to save the others.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.040
Now, how do you decide
who should die?

10:08.040 --> 10:10.543
Oh, I don't believe in
hypothetical situations

10:10.543 --> 10:13.879
Mr. Donaghy, That's like
lying to your brain.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.514
Kenneth, you've lived
a sheltered life.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.683
Virtue never tested is no virtue at all.

10:17.683 --> 10:19.674
Oh, I have been tested, sir.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.155
There are only two things
I love in this world...

10:23.155 --> 10:25.191
everybody and television.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.893
But up in my neighborhood,
we can't even afford cable.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.262
So my neighbor,
the Colonel, and I

10:30.262 --> 10:33.232
just watched whatever the ol'
rabbit ears pick up.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.867
A lot of folks have chosen to go ahead

10:34.867 --> 10:36.102
and steal cable

10:36.102 --> 10:38.537
from the poor, defenseless
cable company.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.873
But not me.

10:40.873 --> 10:44.677
As bad as I want all those
channels, I don't do it

10:44.677 --> 10:46.278
because stealing is wrong.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.015
Kenneth, I'm familiar
with the 10 Commandments.

10:49.015 --> 10:51.279
10?

10:53.953 --> 10:56.022
A lot of us women eat
emotionally, Liz.

10:56.022 --> 10:58.424
And while we're not always
in control of our feelings

10:58.424 --> 11:01.060
we do control of
the decisions we make.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.395
I know, of course.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.193
Now, you say that
you want a child

11:05.631 --> 11:09.965
and yet, you let Jenna and Tracy
fill that role in your life.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.604
Maybe you're afraid

11:11.604 --> 11:13.406
of taking that next step.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.041
Oh, my God, that's it!

11:15.041 --> 11:16.709
Now that we've
leveled off

11:16.709 --> 11:18.144
I think they're gonna
serve us a little snack.

11:18.144 --> 11:20.079
So true, so wise.

11:20.079 --> 11:22.348
You know, when you say
that to everything

11:22.348 --> 11:24.216
it makes me feel like
you're not listening.

11:24.216 --> 11:25.851
Sorry.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.086
Here, try this.

11:27.086 --> 11:30.623
It's wonderful salt-water
taffy from Rhode Island.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.392
Wow, is this one of
your "favorite things"?

11:33.392 --> 11:34.160
Oh, yes.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.495
And I have so many wonderful
favorite things this year.

11:36.495 --> 11:39.658
Sweater capes,
calypso music...

11:40.933 --> 11:42.730
paisley tops...
Chinese checkers

11:43.736 --> 11:44.904
High-heel
flip-flops

11:44.904 --> 11:47.840
that lift up your butt
and give you a work-out.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.241
And you...

11:49.241 --> 11:51.106
Liz Lemon.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.241
Too many women are wearing
themselves too thin these days.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.716
And what suffers
because of that?

11:56.716 --> 11:57.650
Your bowel movements.

11:57.650 --> 11:58.651
Your personal life.

11:58.651 --> 11:59.752
Personal life, yes.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.588
I want to help you,
what can I do?

12:02.588 --> 12:04.290
Oh, my God,
would you say...

12:04.290 --> 12:07.359
"Please welcome, Liz Lemon!"

12:07.359 --> 12:08.427
No.

12:08.427 --> 12:09.595
But here is what
I will do.

12:09.595 --> 12:11.731
While I'm in New York,
if you want

12:11.731 --> 12:13.899
I can stop by
and I can talk

12:13.899 --> 12:15.127
to Tracy and Jenna.

12:15.601 --> 12:17.670
Solve that little
problem for you

12:17.670 --> 12:19.772
so you can
concentrate

12:19.772 --> 12:21.607
on Liz for once.

12:21.607 --> 12:24.610
Oh, you are the best
person in the whole world.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.022
Good grief.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.324
Hi, strangers!

12:38.324 --> 12:41.761
Do you think I'm sexy?
Giggle, giggle, giggle!

12:41.761 --> 12:45.097
Tracy, I know it's you.
And, yeah, I do.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.600
I'm meeting my girlfriends
for brunch!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.468
I hope we can sit outside!

12:49.468 --> 12:50.833
Lipstick!

12:58.077 --> 12:59.879
Jack, what are you
doing down here?

12:59.879 --> 13:01.580
It's been a real
crazy day, Lemon.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.715
We're bidding to build a wind
farm in Turkey

13:02.715 --> 13:04.049
and I'm trying
to convince the board

13:04.049 --> 13:06.018
to sell the
Locomotive Division

13:06.018 --> 13:08.320
and Kenneth is being
a real stick in the mud.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.413
Well, there's nothing
to see down here!

13:11.590 --> 13:14.193
Everything is under
control in Studio 6H.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.594
Good morning!

13:15.594 --> 13:17.255
No! No, no, no!

13:18.264 --> 13:19.565
No, no, no!

13:19.565 --> 13:22.261
No, no, no...
wait, stop!

13:23.402 --> 13:24.870
Why do you have a monster claw?

13:24.870 --> 13:26.605
They ran out of
white make-up 'cause I insisted

13:26.605 --> 13:27.594
they do my buttocks.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.609
Good morning!

13:30.609 --> 13:32.444
What is going on here?

13:32.444 --> 13:33.712
Jenna and I are
doing a social experiment.

13:33.712 --> 13:34.713
No, you're not.

13:34.713 --> 13:36.615
Wait, what is
Jenna doing?

13:36.615 --> 13:37.716
? You gotta ease on down?

13:37.716 --> 13:39.618
? Ease on down the road?

13:39.618 --> 13:40.642
Jenna, stop that right now.

13:41.387 --> 13:44.056
This is worse than when you
wore your shorts to work.

13:44.056 --> 13:45.925
You realize this
is incredibly offensive.

13:45.925 --> 13:46.659
Yes.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.261
And you realize blackface makeup
reignites racial stereotypes

13:49.261 --> 13:50.629
African-Americans have worked

13:50.629 --> 13:52.331
for hundreds of years
to overcome.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.299
Here we go.

13:53.299 --> 13:54.099
Yeah, it's bad.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.234
I get it,
Go get some baby wipes!

13:55.234 --> 13:56.702
We're trying to prove

13:56.702 --> 13:59.071
women or black men.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.674
white men.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.309
We make the unpopular,
difficult decisions...

14:03.309 --> 14:04.977
the tough choices.

14:04.977 --> 14:06.779
We land on the moon and Normandy
Beach, and yet, they resent us.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.314
Well, sir...

14:08.314 --> 14:10.616
I'm sorry to disagree,
but I am also a white man...

14:10.616 --> 14:12.618
No, you are not,
socio-economically speaking

14:12.618 --> 14:14.320
you are more like
an inner-city Latina.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.922
The point is, men like
me have to step in

14:16.922 --> 14:18.090
and clean up messes like this.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.726
No, you don't, I've got
this under control!

14:20.726 --> 14:23.395
She's coming, Jack,
Oprah is coming!

14:23.395 --> 14:26.558
And she's gonna fix everything,
Oprah!

14:34.607 --> 14:36.575
Oh, my, what was that?

14:36.575 --> 14:38.344
We've tripped the
emergency brake, Kenneth.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.045
Mr. Donaghy?

14:40.045 --> 14:42.081
And I've hermetically
sealed this elevator car.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.183
No air can get
in or out.

14:44.183 --> 14:47.152
Don't worry, folks,
help will be here soon

14:47.152 --> 14:49.788
and we have enough oxygen...
for eight people.

14:49.788 --> 14:52.658
Unfortunately, there are
nine of us in here.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.493
Now... one must die.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.629
Mr. Donaghy!

14:56.629 --> 14:58.030
In the panel where the
elevator phone should be

14:58.030 --> 14:59.964
I placed a pistol
loaded with one bullet.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.342
It's empty!

15:10.342 --> 15:13.312
Then you'll have to choke me
with my belt.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.542
I will fight you. It's human nature.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.184
What is wrong with you?!

15:21.887 --> 15:25.891
Oprah smells like rosewater
and warm laundry.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.361
Did she tell you any of her new
favorite things for this year?

15:29.361 --> 15:35.334
Calypso, paisley, Chinese
checkers and sweater capes.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.902
Let's go to
the mall!

15:36.902 --> 15:39.234
Did she touch you?

15:47.212 --> 15:48.847
Well, Kenneth, I give up.

15:48.847 --> 15:51.684
I thought pure morality
died with Chuck Heston

15:51.684 --> 15:52.851
but you proved me wrong.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.853
You are better
than all of us.

15:54.853 --> 15:58.057
You are one Latina fantastica.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.992
Hola.

15:59.992 --> 16:01.560
Kenneth Ellen Parcell...

16:01.560 --> 16:03.562
you are my hero.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.931
You don't mean "hero" like
"sandwich," do you?

16:05.931 --> 16:08.491
No, Kenneth... not like sandwich.

16:53.579 --> 16:56.382
Oh, no.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.528
Oprah's coming.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.630
I haven't
seen Oprah since

17:11.630 --> 17:13.965
she did that episode about
the worst celebrity dads.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.267
Um, Liz?

17:15.267 --> 17:17.394
Your guest is here.

17:18.337 --> 17:19.531
Oprah!

17:20.439 --> 17:22.531
Hello, Liz Lemon!

17:28.414 --> 17:29.415
Uh, how you doin'?

17:29.415 --> 17:30.616
Hi!

17:30.616 --> 17:32.584
What were you on?
That's a kid.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.254
That does explain some
of the stuff she said.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.848
I get to fly first class 'cause
my mom is a flight attendant!

17:38.424 --> 17:40.016
I lost my headgear at Six Flags.

17:41.026 --> 17:42.861
My boyfriend's in ninth grade!

17:42.861 --> 17:45.697
It's not Oprah.

17:45.697 --> 17:46.965
I thought
it was Oprah.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.934
It's a spunky, little tween.

17:48.934 --> 17:52.871
Now, as I am sure Liz has told
you, I am Pam.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.273
Pam.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.638
I'm a middle school
class vice president...

17:56.809 --> 17:59.011
a certified and trained
baby-sitter

17:59.011 --> 18:01.046
and I recently got Internet
in my room!

18:01.046 --> 18:02.648
I think I gave her wine.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.183
I believe I can achieve anything.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.786
So let's get down
to solving this problem.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.253
Now which one of you is "Jana"?

18:14.893 --> 18:16.028
Hello, Mr. Donaghy.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.296
Did you have a
good night, Kenneth?

18:17.296 --> 18:20.632
Oh, yes, sir, hardly any
screaming from the Colonel.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.835
Actually,
I was thinking...

18:22.835 --> 18:27.739
We all try to be perfect,
but the world...

18:27.739 --> 18:29.575
maybe, well...

18:29.575 --> 18:31.643
uh, what I'm
trying to say...

18:31.643 --> 18:35.781
There's a whole channel on
the cable that just tells you

18:35.781 --> 18:37.583
what's on the other channels!

18:37.583 --> 18:39.151
I know, Kenneth, it's okay.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.988
I am glad I'm not
a white man, Mr. Donaghy.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.092
Is SpongeBob
SquarePants

18:47.092 --> 18:48.660
supposed to be terrifying?

18:48.660 --> 18:51.288
You're darn right he is, Kenneth.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.102
Yesterday, Liz
and I realized

18:57.102 --> 19:01.406
that she's probably wearing
the wrong bra size.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.203
Oh.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.613
Yup... that one's
definitely bigger.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.948
And that
made me feel sad.

19:09.948 --> 19:12.314
Now show me your
emotion drawings.

19:15.287 --> 19:16.555
Tracy, your emotion
is upside-down.

19:16.555 --> 19:20.292
That's the way
my world is right now.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.060
I guess I'm gonna have to
clean up your mess after all.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.196
She's 12, how did I...

19:24.196 --> 19:25.731
It's okay, it happens
to the best of us.

19:25.731 --> 19:28.400
In-flight medication is how
I met M. Night Shyamalan

19:28.400 --> 19:29.568
until it turned out to be...

19:29.568 --> 19:31.737
That was the best
day of my life.

19:31.737 --> 19:32.804
Liz...

19:32.804 --> 19:33.805
we worked it out.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.240
I've been hearing...

19:35.240 --> 19:37.576
but I haven't been listening.

19:37.576 --> 19:42.548
And I need to stop being a
frenemy and be your real B.F.F.

19:42.548 --> 19:46.541
Well... Iooks like
my work here is done.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.556
So, I'll see you at my
parents' house for dinner.

19:50.556 --> 19:51.990
My best friend
Gayle can't make it

19:51.990 --> 19:53.926
because she has some
algebra test tomorrow.

19:53.926 --> 19:54.915
Oh, Gayle!

19:55.961 --> 19:57.596
Good job, Lemon.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.464
Good job, Pam, really.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.799
take credit.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.096
Hmm.

20:03.402 --> 20:07.172
? Lean on me...
when you're not strong?

20:07.172 --> 20:08.807
We're not doing that now.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.707
Stop that, do you hear me?

20:12.311 --> 20:14.112
I don't think I should be
drinking this.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.081
Oh, come on, like you
never have a drink.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.784
Well, I did have some champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.086
Yeah, you did! To Oprah!

20:21.086 --> 20:23.422
My name is Pam.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.322
Oh, Oprah!

20:26.305 --> 20:32.837
