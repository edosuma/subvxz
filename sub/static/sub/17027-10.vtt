KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.705 --> 00:08.342
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.278
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.311 --> 00:11.745
and by the time I got here,

00:11.779 --> 00:16.550
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.320
I hid who I really was,
until one day

00:19.353 --> 00:22.556
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.590 --> 00:26.127
To most people,
I'm a reporter
at Catco Worldwide Media.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.597
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.630 --> 00:31.599
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.632 --> 00:34.502
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.606
I am Supergirl.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.408
KARA:
Previously on Supergirl...

00:40.441 --> 00:42.243
-You're a white Martian?
-I am not like them.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.711
You need to believe me.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.614
I spared you so you can rot
in a cell for all eternity.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.684
This is Leslie Willis
coming to you alive,
and wired.

00:50.718 --> 00:54.555
Leslie Willis is dead.
This is Livewire.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.291
I wanna be a superhero.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.660
-You're serious?
-I wanna help you
keep the world spinning.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.741
-Oh!
-Hey, careful.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.677
-I'm okay. Yeah?
-Uh... Mon-El?

01:54.382 --> 01:55.716
Mistakes were made.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.386
But it's our fewest
cardboard fatalities yet.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.753
-I think you're ready.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.755
I mean, you're dedicated.

02:01.789 --> 02:02.890
You punch really hard.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.925
Not as hard as you. Yet.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.660
-Ever.
-Okay.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.497
But when you deflected
that laser, you hit this girl.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.499
Oh, the headless one, yeah.

02:11.532 --> 02:14.435
So, what is our
number-one rule as heroes?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.337
-Protect the people.
-Yes.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.906
Are we clear on the whole
protect-citizens-above-all
else thing?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.574
Yes. Clear.
Super clear.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.176
Supergirl clear.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.945
I'm just kidding.
No, seriously, we're clear.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.348
-Let's do it again.
-Uh... Well,

02:27.381 --> 02:28.849
I think you might
need to change.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.251
Oh...

02:30.918 --> 02:32.853
I think it's time.

Are you hurt?

Yeah.
Smashy smashy.
Shoot shoot.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.565
Yeah, well, the last part
got complicated.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.601
That's a bullet hole.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.703
That's a bullet hole
in a suit I made.

03:22.736 --> 03:23.971
It grazed my arm.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.573
-Did you get shot?
-I'm a little shot.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.475
That is it. That's it.
We're telling Kara.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.709
-Would you please calm down?
-No.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.744
Dude, I can't...
I can't do this anymore.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.780
All right.
If there's a flaw
in your suit

03:32.813 --> 03:34.715
that means the suit
is faulty. Which means
I have to go fix it.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.451
And that already on top of me
having to make Mon-El a suit.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.919
-Mon-El?
-Oh, yeah.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.255
Didn't you hear?
He graduated from
superhero kindergarten,

03:41.289 --> 03:44.392
so now I have to
make him a suit,
according to Kara.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.460
And that just means
more work for me.

03:46.494 --> 03:49.397
Wait, so that frat boy
wants to be a superhero?

03:49.430 --> 03:50.864

03:52.666 --> 03:55.436
Okay. The workload.
The lying to Kara.
It's gotta stop.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.037
Winn, you know
what she's gonna say.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.006
Maybe she's gonna be
totally cool about all this,
all right?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.374
You guys have worked
together before.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.009

what you do.

for the help.

the first time I have ever
asked you for something.

as a guard helped her out.

The deal is that she brings
death and destruction.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.928

How's she doing?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.734
(SIGHS)

11:06.767 --> 11:08.268
I have run every test
that I can.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.170
There's nothing wrong
with her physically.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.438
Nothing.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.240
But her... Her brain...

11:14.207 --> 11:15.776
It's like her...

11:15.809 --> 11:17.044
It's like her mind is drowning

11:17.077 --> 11:18.445
and it's pulling her body
down with it.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.814
Just say it, Alex,
she's dying.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.783
Brain death is
a few hours away.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.385
-What is doing this?
-You tell me.

11:25.418 --> 11:29.156
You know, Martian biology
is usually intertwined with
psychic phenomena.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.158
Could something be attacking
her in her mind?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.793
-It's not me.
-I know that.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.128
I may want her in prison
but I wouldn't hurt her.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.363
Will you help her?

11:36.396 --> 11:37.798

-You don't know that.
-If anyone can help her,
J'onn, it's you.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.077
I know how you feel
about White Martians.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.444
Don't ask me to do this, Alex.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.213
You have shown them
mercy before.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.181
Not this!

11:54.214 --> 11:55.983
I will not give her
my people's memories.

11:56.016 --> 11:59.086
I will not give her
my daughters' smiles.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.755
Her kind has taken
enough from me.
From us!

12:02.389 --> 12:03.824
If she dies, she dies.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.059

I, uh... (CLEARS THROAT)
Want to tell you something.

Yeah, me, too.
(STAMMERS) I am losing
my mind right now.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.035
Livewire is just out there
roaming the streets,

12:48.068 --> 12:50.003
and I don't know where she is,
or when she'll strike.

12:50.037 --> 12:53.540
I just know she's
out there somewhere and
she's going to hurt people.

The city is not
defenseless, Kara.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.911
I hate having a nemesis.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.413
Clark always makes it
look so much fun,

13:00.447 --> 13:03.951
like you have a deadly pen pal
you see once a year.

13:03.984 --> 13:07.287
But having a nemesis
is stressful.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.156
Well, you're not
alone in this fight.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.458
You have friends.
You have help.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.866
Yeah.

13:18.899 --> 13:22.369
Yes, that is actually
such a relief.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.603
(SIGHS)

13:23.636 --> 13:25.405
I, for one, am relieved
to hear you say that.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.875
I mean you're right.
I don't have to
face her alone.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.277
-Absolutely not.
-I have Mon-El.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.413
-Mon-El?
-Yeah.

13:34.614 --> 13:38.018
Right. The, um...

13:38.051 --> 13:40.020
Yes, I have been training him.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.521
And you're sure
that's a good idea?

13:41.554 --> 13:44.257
Well, how often does someone
with superpowers just show up?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.393
Yeah, that's true.
But, um...

13:46.426 --> 13:50.097
There's a lot more
important things than having
powers to being a hero.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.900
-Of course, yeah, but...
-Like wanting to
make a difference,

13:52.933 --> 13:57.170
or having the willingness
to put yourself
on the line for others.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.540
And I just think that Mon-El

14:00.573 --> 14:03.276
is the kind of the guy who
thinks about himself first.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.178
Well, he's come
a really long way.

with training.

against Mon-El?

No, I don't.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.286
I think he's a fun guy.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.223
He's just not a hero.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.125

Never mind.

want to tell me?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.266
I owe you that much.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.601
But you need to tell me why.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.838
Because that thing
that you feel...

you want to make
everything better...

20:41.908 --> 20:45.312

20:45.345 --> 20:47.680
She had to know
that there was a chance

20:47.714 --> 20:50.783
saving you would
reveal her as a White Martian.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.354

20:54.387 --> 20:57.990
She said she tried
to help your kind.

in the Bond?

see into her past,

maybe you can find
some good there.

WINN: Yeah.

Now,
I'm no jail break expert...

23:41.954 --> 23:43.990
J'ONN: Livewire didn't escape.
She was taken.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.692
She was a victim.

23:46.793 --> 23:47.960
I was wrong.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.596
Don't beat yourself up.

23:49.629 --> 23:50.663
Agent Schott, have you had
any luck tracking Livewire

23:50.697 --> 23:52.565
or the people who took her?

23:52.599 --> 23:56.235
Not yet.
I'm actually having some
trouble delineating her energy

23:56.268 --> 23:57.837
from other wavelengths.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.005
You keep working.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.206
Mon-El? You're on standby.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.808

I need you in the med bay.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.648
-Hey, you got a second?
-JAMES: Yeah.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.683
-How's the mood down there?
-Oh, pretty bleak.

24:10.717 --> 24:12.985
They're all worried 'cause
I haven't found Livewire yet.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.521
Funny thing about that?

24:14.554 --> 24:16.889
I totally know
where Livewire is.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.059
-How?
-Short answer, science.

24:20.092 --> 24:23.996
You wanna go catch her
and show Supergirl exactly
what we can do?

24:24.030 --> 24:26.132

24:44.216 --> 24:46.853

It's the right thing to do.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.892
I've, uh, never attempted this
with a White Martian.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.762
I don't know what'll happen.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.864
If things get hairy,
I'm gonna pull you out.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.968
I need you to do
something for me.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.102
Of course.

25:04.571 --> 25:07.907
I'm going to relive
some things.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.912
Deaths. The war.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.280
What do you need?

25:14.313 --> 25:15.682
Stay with me.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.751
Both of you.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.087
-We're not leaving.
-We're here, J'onn.

25:23.923 --> 25:24.924
All right.

26:03.930 --> 26:04.964
M'gann?

26:06.232 --> 26:07.700
This is where it happens.

26:10.136 --> 26:11.704
What is happening to you?

26:15.141 --> 26:17.944
Run, Green.
They'll kill you
if they find you here.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.850
M'gann, it's J'onn.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.087
This is a memory.
We are in no danger here.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.657
I set the fire.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.058
I killed the other guards.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.326
They'll find me.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.695
They'll kill me.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.796
That's all right.
I deserve it.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.831
But they can't find you.
Please.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.770
That's the fire
in the guard house?

26:43.803 --> 26:45.672
They wanted me
to kill a child.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.207
A little boy.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.610
He was crying,
and they laughed.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.714
I took him behind
the barracks.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.884
He was so afraid of me.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.086
I couldn't do it.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.888
I couldn't.

27:04.423 --> 27:05.892
Run!

27:08.828 --> 27:10.830
I went back
and killed my people.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.766
They will not forgive.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.803
I'm going to die here.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.772
Listen to me.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.208
You don't die here.

You live.

back to life, but I could
make you feel less alone.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.847
We could be a team again.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.450
You mean we just back you up
but never get
to do it ourselves, right?

36:59.885 --> 37:00.986
You'll live.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.389
But not the lives
we want.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.457
I don't want to be
the guy at the office anymore.

37:05.491 --> 37:08.360
Yeah, I don't want to just
be stuck behind a computer.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.728
JAMES: We're going to do this.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.330
And we're going to do this
alone if we have to.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.265
But we would love
to work with you.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.434
Always.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.569
You know,
you two were heroes to me.

37:18.337 --> 37:19.605
Way before all of this.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.309
I know you want
to help people,

37:23.342 --> 37:25.677
but this is not
the way to do it.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.812
I won't stop you.

37:26.845 --> 37:30.682
But as long as you are putting
yourselves in danger,

37:30.716 --> 37:32.318
I can't support it.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.388
I guess that's it, then.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.257
I guess so.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.308
(KNOCKING)

37:57.376 --> 37:58.577
Feeling better?

37:58.910 --> 38:00.078
Better.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.480
Come in.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.718
(SIGHS)

38:06.752 --> 38:07.853
Thank you.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.791
So, how long
do I stay here?

38:12.824 --> 38:15.761
Alex says you need
a few days of observation.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.530
Then back to my cell.

38:19.097 --> 38:20.832
No.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.334
You're free.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.870
The things you did...

38:26.004 --> 38:27.673
You've paid your debt.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.775
We both have
a right to move on.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.415
There's something
I need to tell you.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.350
I know what happened to me.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.752
There was a psychic attack.

38:40.786 --> 38:45.357
I was shielding my mind,
but I got trapped
inside myself.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.593
Shielding from what?

38:48.026 --> 38:49.995
My people.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.530
They know where I am.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.466
They're coming.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.677
Hi.

39:05.711 --> 39:06.845
Hey.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.384
Yeah, that's your door.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.520
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.424
So, are you okay?

39:18.457 --> 39:19.891
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.628
Um...

39:23.795 --> 39:25.631
Just you, uh...

39:27.899 --> 39:29.435
You were right.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.404
I remember kissing you.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.142
Do you...
Do you want to sit?

39:37.175 --> 39:39.445
-I... I feel like...
-Yeah, sure.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.846
I think we're gonna sit.
That's a good idea.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.586
I remember.

39:50.188 --> 39:51.857
I was sick and alone.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.026
And you were leaning over me.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.128
And you must have been sad.

39:57.162 --> 40:00.466
Or something because your eyes
were insanely blue.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.568
I mean, they always are.

40:02.601 --> 40:06.705
But they were like comets.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.941
And I had never seen anyone
so stunning,

40:11.510 --> 40:12.744
and I kissed you,

40:16.582 --> 40:19.417
and it was okay that I was...

40:22.954 --> 40:25.691
It was okay that I was going
to die, because I'd gotten
to kiss you.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.033
I, um... (CLEARS THROAT)

40:35.066 --> 40:38.904
I saved you at
the police station because...

40:40.739 --> 40:42.774
Because I care about you.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.780
(WHISPERS) Comets.

40:50.248 --> 40:52.217
Mon-El...

40:52.250 --> 40:54.152
I'm not here
to change your mind.

40:54.185 --> 40:56.655
I get that... I get that you
don't care about me.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.089
I do care about you.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.190
But not in the same way.

40:59.224 --> 41:01.560
That's... (CLEARS THROAT)

41:01.593 --> 41:03.094
That's good, that's fine.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.530
It's okay.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.765
You know, just keep
working with me.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.067
I've been honest about it,
so let's just...

41:09.100 --> 41:11.670
Now we can ignore it, right?
We can let it go.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.238
Let's put it behind us.

41:13.271 --> 41:14.940
-Yeah?
-Uh, yeah.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.542
-Yeah, of course.
-Just keep being my partner.

41:16.575 --> 41:17.843
Of course.

41:18.677 --> 41:20.612
Thank you for being honest.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.749
Yeah, okay. Good.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.687
(CLEARS THROAT) Good talk.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.094
(CHUCKLES)

41:39.030 --> 41:40.699
I'll see you
tomorrow, partner.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.702
Uh-huh.

41:46.572 --> 41:47.806
(DOOR CLOSES)
