WEBVTT

00:20.500 --> 00:22.866
I'll be back, I'm free.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.533
Aah!

00:48.833 --> 00:53.000
'"My new house," a film
by Billy Hastings.'

00:53.066 --> 00:54.800
'Starring, my new house pets'

00:54.866 --> 00:58.433
'Bullwinkle, Porky
and, of course, Bambi.'

00:59.733 --> 01:02.033
'Amazingly lifelike, huh?'

01:03.533 --> 01:06.000
'And nature's best friend'

01:06.066 --> 01:07.400
'the Winchester.'

01:09.000 --> 01:12.266
'Finally, the big
white hunter himself, Al.'

01:12.333 --> 01:13.900
'My new dad.'

01:13.966 --> 01:16.000
'Give us a wave, Al.'

01:18.166 --> 01:21.233
'Ah, the fair lady
of the house, my mom.'

01:23.033 --> 01:25.533
'Just one big happy family.'

01:29.366 --> 01:31.000
Hey, Spielberg,
you wanna stop screwin' around

01:31.066 --> 01:32.066
'and give me a hand?'

01:32.133 --> 01:33.366
I'm just taking a little break.

01:33.433 --> 01:36.033
And I told you not
to touch my equipment.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.266
That's a very
expensive camera.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.100
Not some toy.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.600
And when we get back,
I'll be more than happy

01:44.666 --> 01:46.400
to teach you how
to use this properly.

01:46.466 --> 01:49.200
Oh, I just love
home movies.

01:49.266 --> 01:50.966
Years from now,
we'll be able to look back

01:51.033 --> 01:53.300
and remember
exactly how it was

01:53.366 --> 01:55.500
starting our new family.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.400
Oh!

01:57.466 --> 01:58.533
'Bear trap?'

01:58.600 --> 02:02.100
Al, I told you
to put that in the garage.

02:03.233 --> 02:04.633
The guns are bad enough.

02:04.700 --> 02:07.700
I mean the, I mean
these things are dangerous.

02:14.266 --> 02:17.066
Whoa, that's my records.

02:17.133 --> 02:18.466
And what the hell
they doing down here?

02:18.533 --> 02:20.533
It's your stuff,
it oughta be upstairs.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.600
This family portrait's about

02:49.666 --> 02:52.900
to suffer
a revoltin' development.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.500
I hate to leave you like this
on our first week in this house.

03:04.566 --> 03:06.500
Hey, mom,
don't worry about it.

03:06.566 --> 03:08.433
- Yeah.
- You only get one honeymoon.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.066
Yeah, well,
one per marriage anyway.

03:12.166 --> 03:13.433
- Yeah!
- Oh!

03:13.500 --> 03:16.033
Um, I have the number
of Club Ned

03:16.100 --> 03:17.500
in case you need us.

03:17.566 --> 03:19.866
Oh, I'll be just fine,
I'm sure.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.733
Yeah, you'll probably be
so busy making new friends

03:22.800 --> 03:24.566
that you won't even
notice that we're gone.

03:24.633 --> 03:26.100
Dah, probably just
hang around

03:26.166 --> 03:28.133
and try and get
my room together, you know.

03:30.266 --> 03:32.033
O-oh, look!

03:32.100 --> 03:35.433
Al, he tries to act
like Mr. Macho

03:35.500 --> 03:38.433
but deep down
he's such a romantic.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.866
- Oh, honey..
- Hmm-hmm.

03:42.933 --> 03:45.833
How sweet of you.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.066
Yeah, Happy Mother's Day.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.833
Mwah, I completely forgot.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.433
Thanks.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.566
Oh, you really are
my Prince Charming.

03:56.633 --> 03:58.500
And thanks to Al,
I can finally

03:58.566 --> 04:01.566
give you the house
that you deserve.

04:01.633 --> 04:02.933
Yup.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.700
It's real important that
you two start getting along.

04:10.533 --> 04:13.766
The marriage, the move,
it's all been pretty stressful.

04:13.833 --> 04:15.966
And you know,
Al has a bad heart.

04:16.033 --> 04:18.100
Mom, he-he,
Al has no heart.

04:26.866 --> 04:30.433
Remember, when I get back,
I expect to find all my things

04:30.500 --> 04:33.533
exactly, exactly
where I left 'em.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.666
Come on, Al.

04:35.733 --> 04:38.833
'Billy's a very responsible
young man.'

04:41.333 --> 04:42.666
- Bye, mom.
- Bye, honey.

04:42.733 --> 04:44.200
- Have fun.
- Yeah.

04:48.166 --> 04:51.266
Not too much fun,
I know you kids.

04:58.833 --> 05:01.400
You don't know me at all.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.300
Having problems?

05:28.366 --> 05:31.366
Frustrated, call
Dr. Sherry Gamble.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.966
I give advice
and I tell it straight.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.966
Frankly, I don't see
the problem.

05:36.033 --> 05:37.600
Your mom has a right
to get married.

05:37.666 --> 05:41.200
And what about me? I mean,
the guy is a control freak.

05:41.266 --> 05:42.733
You know, what I hear?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.900
A baby, who's mad
because he's not the center

05:44.966 --> 05:46.300
of attention anymore.

05:46.366 --> 05:47.300
'You're gonna have
to share mommy now.'

05:48.666 --> 05:50.000
That's life, buster.

05:50.066 --> 05:51.933
So stop whining and grow up.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.033
'This is Springwood's own'

05:53.100 --> 05:54.700
'Dr. Sherry Gamble on Lifeline.'

05:54.766 --> 05:57.400
Giving advice
and telling it straight.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.233
- Uh!
- Ah!

06:06.300 --> 06:09.433
Sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.566
It's okay.

06:11.633 --> 06:13.100
Ha-ha, I guess I'm
not used to living

06:13.166 --> 06:14.866
in such a friendly neighborhood.

06:14.933 --> 06:17.233
Well, I saw your parents
leave and I thought maybe

06:17.300 --> 06:19.100
it would be a good time
to get acquainted.

06:19.166 --> 06:22.833
- I'm Barbara Gamble.
- Yeah, Billy Hastings.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.400
So you're now the only
person I know in Springwood.

06:25.466 --> 06:29.033
Hmm, plenty of people
know who you are.

06:29.100 --> 06:32.100
This house has been empty
since the Freddy Krueger thing.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.433
The what?

06:34.033 --> 06:36.466
Nobody told you?

06:36.533 --> 06:39.566
God! There ought to be a law.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.833
Freddy Krueger
was a psycho-killer.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.600
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, eh.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.633
That's bad.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.766
One of his, uh,
last victims lived here.

06:54.833 --> 06:57.200
Don't worry. Freddy's gone.

06:58.866 --> 07:01.933
- Too bad.
- What?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.400
Well, maybe he could deal with
that jerk my mom just married.

07:04.466 --> 07:05.666
Big Al.

07:05.733 --> 07:07.633
Bossy?

07:07.700 --> 07:10.433
Does the nameay
mean anything to you?

07:10.500 --> 07:14.500
New stepdads.
They're all like that.

07:14.566 --> 07:17.200
My mom's been
married three times.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.033
Can I use your phone?

07:21.100 --> 07:22.100
Yeah.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.266
Mine got yanked.
Too many parties.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.600
Including the one that
I planned for tonight

07:28.666 --> 07:31.133
which now I have to cancel.

07:33.133 --> 07:34.500
When are your folks
getting back?

07:34.566 --> 07:37.500
Next week. They went to Mexico.

07:37.566 --> 07:38.533
So we..

07:39.766 --> 07:42.100
You have this
place all to yourself.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.133
Yeah.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.800
Jeanie, guess where I am?

07:52.866 --> 07:55.666
'Remember Freddy Krueger?'

07:55.733 --> 07:58.000
'Well, I'm across
the street at the house'

07:58.066 --> 08:00.433
'where Freddy killed that kid.'

08:00.500 --> 08:05.566
'Yeah, I was wondering what
you and Ann were doing tonight.'

08:05.633 --> 08:06.600
'Really?'

08:07.700 --> 08:08.633
'Great.'

08:32.233 --> 08:34.200
Turn it on.

08:34.266 --> 08:37.500
Uh! It's Al's.
It's Al's, I can't.

08:37.566 --> 08:39.866
How's he gonna know?

08:47.566 --> 08:50.033
This is the room where
that poor kid got it.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.400
Kh-h-h-h.

08:51.466 --> 08:52.733
Creepy, huh?

08:52.800 --> 08:53.733
Yeah.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.466
Uh, let's stay outta here, okay?

08:56.533 --> 08:59.033
Don't be so scared.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.933
Freddy's long gone.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.433
Yeah, I know, it's not really

09:02.500 --> 09:03.933
Freddy I'm worried about.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.433
Your stepdad's
really gotten you rattled, huh?

09:07.866 --> 09:09.700
Relax.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.100
Every time my mom gets married

09:12.166 --> 09:16.933
her and her hubby forget
I'm alive for about six months.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.766
You gotta make your own fun.

09:20.833 --> 09:23.200
Yeah, heh.

09:23.266 --> 09:26.766
Look, maybe I should just split.

09:26.833 --> 09:30.500
No, no, uh, stick around.

09:34.766 --> 09:36.866
What is Big Al?

09:36.933 --> 09:39.500
Some kind of
a movie photographer?

09:39.566 --> 09:42.033
No! Wildlife.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.400
Say, cheese!

10:08.700 --> 10:10.100
Barbara?

10:15.200 --> 10:16.800
Barbara?

11:02.466 --> 11:03.600
Where'd you go?

11:03.666 --> 11:06.966
I've been looking
for you all over.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.666
I don't know.

11:08.733 --> 11:09.933
Whoa!

11:10.000 --> 11:12.933
Think I just blanked out
or somethin'.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.033
This moving thing
must be gettin' to me.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.766
'That's my..'

11:26.366 --> 11:31.000
Now, that's what I call
wildlife photography.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.733
Oh, that's probably for me.

11:42.966 --> 11:44.300
Hey, Barbara.

11:44.366 --> 11:45.666
Hi.

11:45.733 --> 11:48.633
Um, this is Jeanie and Ann.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.366
I told them you're
a real cute guy

11:50.433 --> 11:52.700
and we can move
the party over here.

11:52.766 --> 11:54.900
But, I guess that's out.

11:57.166 --> 12:00.700
Well, we're gonna go.

12:00.766 --> 12:03.033
Maybe I'll come by
again sometime.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.700
Hold it.

12:06.766 --> 12:09.833
We can have the party here.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.066
I mean, my mother told me I had
to make some new friends, right?

12:12.133 --> 12:13.666
- 'Mother knows best.'
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.066
We got, we got wine.

12:15.133 --> 12:18.433
Al's contribution is the least
he can do for his new son.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.700
- 'Knock, knock.'
- 'Yo-ho, the party's here.'

12:20.766 --> 12:22.333
- Ooh, that must be the guys.
- 'Open up. Anybody home?'

12:22.400 --> 12:24.100
Can't have a party
without men.

12:24.166 --> 12:25.300
'Oh-ho.'

12:29.933 --> 12:31.466
Alright.

12:31.533 --> 12:35.400
Hey, this is like totally rad,
whose house is this?

12:35.466 --> 12:38.100
Nice place for
a Freddy house.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.366
- How's it goin'?
- Hi.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.133
'What's in here?'

12:44.866 --> 12:45.833
'Andy, check this out.'

12:45.900 --> 12:48.266
Ever heard of CDs?

12:52.866 --> 12:54.000
Hey, man?

12:54.100 --> 12:55.633
Hey!

12:55.700 --> 12:59.166
- Hey, what?
- Hey, take it easy, Jack.

12:59.233 --> 13:01.766
It's his house.

13:01.833 --> 13:04.400
Um, why don't you show me

13:04.466 --> 13:06.200
the rest of your place?

13:06.266 --> 13:09.800
I bet you've got
a great view

13:09.866 --> 13:13.533
from your bedroom window
to my room.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.066
Ah, my room,
it-it's a wreck.

13:16.133 --> 13:18.633
We'll take care of that.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.600
- Catch you later, Billy.
- Right.

13:24.866 --> 13:26.433
My room.

13:27.066 --> 13:28.300
My stuff.

13:30.133 --> 13:32.000
Like the rest of the house
you can pretty much, uh..

13:33.700 --> 13:35.633
...touch anything you want

13:36.800 --> 13:38.633
Hm.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.000
I see, you managed
to unpack something.

13:41.066 --> 13:43.133
Oh...there's,
there's really..

13:43.200 --> 13:46.400
You can't see anything
through this, this, uh..

13:46.466 --> 13:47.800
I bet.

13:58.233 --> 14:01.400
'You and your stepdad have
more in common than you think.'

14:06.733 --> 14:10.366
I like a man that
knows his priorities.

14:10.433 --> 14:14.133
- 'Come on, guys, mellow out.'
- 'Hey, don't do it, Jack.'

14:16.900 --> 14:18.766
What the hell was that?

14:25.533 --> 14:26.800
Hey!

14:37.033 --> 14:39.800
I'll call the cops,
if you don't put that down.

14:39.866 --> 14:42.033
It's your house,
you tell him.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.666
Whoa! Put, put that
thing down, man.

14:56.900 --> 14:59.133
He didn't know it was loaded.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.900
Oh, dude, let me see that.

15:05.133 --> 15:06.633
Oh, my God.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.766
Antique hand cut crystal.

15:13.833 --> 15:16.200
Billy, calm down.
You're gonna get an ulcer.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.500
Guy hassling you?

15:25.133 --> 15:27.533
Turn that down!

15:34.266 --> 15:36.233
Oh, my God!

15:39.966 --> 15:42.566
Well, well,
don't worry about it.

15:42.633 --> 15:44.033
Bet your old man's
a cool dog.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.100
He'll never know
the difference.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.533
Get out of my house!

15:47.600 --> 15:51.166
Get out! Everybody
get out of my house.

15:51.233 --> 15:54.533
Get out of my ho-o-ouse!

16:02.266 --> 16:05.533
- Me too?
- Oh, especially&lt;co

16:08.300 --> 16:09.400
Al.

16:12.433 --> 16:16.566
Al, let me explain.

16:16.633 --> 16:18.833
What the hell went on in here?

16:18.900 --> 16:21.366
Fifteen minutes
in my house and you..

16:21.433 --> 16:23.233
You little bastard.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.533
- You ruined it.
- It wasn't me, Al.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.300
Well, you're out of here,
buster. You're through.

16:28.366 --> 16:29.533
No, you're not listening, man.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.133
Oh, I'm listenin' alright.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.966
You and your friends
trashed my house!

16:34.033 --> 16:35.900
When your mother sees this

16:35.966 --> 16:38.900
she won't want you around
here anymore than I do.

16:44.233 --> 16:47.533
- I tried to stop them, man.
- Like hell you did!

16:48.733 --> 16:50.033
Son of a bitch.

17:22.766 --> 17:25.200
'Billy?'

17:25.266 --> 17:27.166
I've been waiting in the car.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.700
What's taking so long?

17:29.766 --> 17:32.433
Mom, please believe me.

17:32.500 --> 17:36.266
It was not my fault.

17:36.333 --> 17:39.566
How could this
have happened, Billy?

17:39.666 --> 17:40.600
How?

17:40.666 --> 17:42.300
Well, these kids.

17:42.366 --> 17:44.033
They came over, they were

17:44.100 --> 17:47.200
they were crazy,
I couldn't stop 'em.

17:47.266 --> 17:51.733
Billy, when Al sees this,
he's never gonna forgive you.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.233
- Where is Al?
- Uh..

17:57.166 --> 17:58.600
I'm sorry, mom,
I didn't mean it.

17:58.666 --> 18:01.966
But he attacked me,
he tried to kill me.

18:02.033 --> 18:03.966
Didn't mean what, Billy?

18:04.033 --> 18:06.800
What did you do?
Where's Al?

18:31.066 --> 18:34.533
You did that to Al?

18:34.600 --> 18:37.466
Yes, yes, but it's
not what you think.

18:37.533 --> 18:41.933
Not what I think?
Billy, I think you killed Al.

18:45.033 --> 18:46.733
- Am I wrong?
- No.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.900
- Billy, am I wrong?
- Well, no.

18:48.966 --> 18:50.766
But, uh, he came in the house

18:50.833 --> 18:53.666
he went nuts, he came,
he came after me, I mean..

18:53.733 --> 18:56.066
'If I hadn't killed him that'd
be my head up on the wall.'

19:00.733 --> 19:03.000
Billy, this is wonderful.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.233
It is?

19:10.366 --> 19:11.933
I killed your new husband.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.966
Oh..

19:14.033 --> 19:16.533
Billy, he never would have fit
in the family.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.433
Our family.

19:20.133 --> 19:22.466
We just needed a house.

19:22.533 --> 19:24.900
Al gave us that.

19:24.966 --> 19:27.133
Now, we can make it
a home.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.733
Just you and me.
Like it was before.

19:32.300 --> 19:35.133
- You're not gonna turn me in?
- Why?

19:38.533 --> 19:42.000
Would a mother do that
to her son on Mother's Day?

19:43.166 --> 19:45.500
You're the man of
the house now.

19:45.566 --> 19:49.233
We don't need Al
as long as we have each other.

19:50.566 --> 19:51.666
You mean that, mom?

19:51.733 --> 19:53.300
'Mom?'

19:54.633 --> 19:55.933
Billy

19:57.400 --> 20:00.033
I wanted to ask you something,
but you dozed off.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.033
Ask me what?

20:04.100 --> 20:06.966
Well, uh, since
my house is off limits

20:07.033 --> 20:08.900
I was wondering if we can
have the party at your house

20:08.966 --> 20:10.200
since your parents
are out of town.

20:10.266 --> 20:13.333
No, ho-ho-ho,
no party, no way.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.433
- No parties--
- Alright.

20:16.500 --> 20:20.066
I was just asking.
God, you're uptight.

20:20.133 --> 20:22.800
Are you always like this?

20:22.866 --> 20:24.500
No, no.

20:24.566 --> 20:25.900
Whoa!

20:25.966 --> 20:27.266
I'm just tired.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.600
Well, why don't you go
upstairs and get some sleep?

20:30.666 --> 20:33.800
Upstairs, my room is crammed
with boxes, you saw.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.700
I did?

20:41.133 --> 20:42.233
There.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.200
Billy's bed.

20:45.266 --> 20:46.800
Lie down.

20:48.466 --> 20:49.733
Yes, ma'am.

20:57.566 --> 21:00.533
You don't look too good.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.533
Thanks.

21:03.533 --> 21:06.566
You want me to call your mom
and tell her that you're sick?

21:06.633 --> 21:09.600
Big Al would love that.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

21:13.833 --> 21:16.066
Well, I brought you
a cold rag.

21:16.133 --> 21:17.700
Now, let me fix you
something to eat.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.100
'Billy?'

21:22.166 --> 21:23.800
Poor Billy.

21:24.966 --> 21:26.900
No one to take care of you.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.666
Just tell me where it hurts

21:31.733 --> 21:33.433
and I'll kiss
and make it all better.

21:38.366 --> 21:39.833
Billy?

21:41.966 --> 21:43.366
Mom?

21:43.433 --> 21:45.366
'Who is this girl?'

21:45.433 --> 21:48.166
I live next door.

21:48.233 --> 21:49.266
Uh!

21:49.333 --> 21:51.266
I came to borrow the phone.

21:51.333 --> 21:54.266
And instead you borrowed
my son!

21:54.333 --> 21:56.133
Okay, mom, it-it's okay.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.900
Nothin', nothin', nothin'
really happened or anything.

21:59.966 --> 22:00.966
Yet.

22:01.033 --> 22:03.566
You slept with her,
haven't you?

22:03.633 --> 22:05.233
Duh.. Mom, no. I..

22:05.300 --> 22:06.466
I didn't sleep with her.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.333
'Uh, I didn't even touch her.'

22:08.400 --> 22:11.833
Don't lie to your mother.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.400
You little sneak.

22:15.233 --> 22:17.300
You destroyed my wine.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.966
you broke all my records.

22:24.366 --> 22:26.666
Violated my house.

22:26.733 --> 22:29.000
Listen, wait a second.
None of that really happened.

22:29.066 --> 22:31.100
Al, don't hurt him.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.233
Hurt him?

22:33.200 --> 22:35.100
What about me?

22:37.066 --> 22:38.333
Tuh..

22:38.400 --> 22:40.900
He blew a hole
in my best print.

22:40.966 --> 22:43.000
With my shotgun.

22:43.066 --> 22:46.533
Uh! Uh, that was all a dream.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.966
Broke our wedding presents

22:49.033 --> 22:50.533
Hurt him?

22:50.600 --> 22:54.400
'I'm gonna rip his face off.'

22:54.466 --> 22:56.900
I'm gonna rip his face off.

22:56.966 --> 22:59.533
'Billy, I couldn't
find much to eat'

22:59.600 --> 23:00.900
but I made you some tea.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.666
Uh, Billy.

23:13.733 --> 23:14.733
Billy?

23:15.766 --> 23:16.933
Billy?

23:18.133 --> 23:19.100
- Mom.
- Yeah?

23:19.166 --> 23:20.133
You're back.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.533
Thank God.
Al forgot his pills.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.500
He was so damn busy
ordering you around.

23:25.566 --> 23:26.833
Oh, my God!

23:26.900 --> 23:28.366
Billy?

23:28.433 --> 23:30.033
Oh, no.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.100
I only left him for a minute.

23:35.133 --> 23:37.400
What?

23:37.466 --> 23:40.500
Billy, you're gonna be okay.

23:41.266 --> 23:43.666
We'll get an ambulance.

23:43.733 --> 23:44.733
Al?

23:45.733 --> 23:47.200
Al?

23:47.266 --> 23:48.200
Al?

23:50.066 --> 23:51.066
Oh, no!

23:51.133 --> 23:53.766
'This can't be happening.'

23:53.833 --> 23:55.133
'Forget him, mom.'

23:55.200 --> 23:58.833
Al's had a heart attack.

23:58.900 --> 24:02.266
'Hello, airline reservations,
this is Jerry. May I help you?'

24:02.333 --> 24:03.533
'Hello..'

24:06.866 --> 24:09.633
I think the honeymoon is over.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.366
'But I'm pregnant.
My parents will disown me.'

24:31.433 --> 24:34.833
I have devoted dozens of shows
to birth control

24:34.900 --> 24:38.200
but nobody ever listens
until it's too late.

24:38.266 --> 24:39.933
'I'm, I'm Catholic.'

24:40.000 --> 24:41.600
Didn't stop you
from having original sin

24:41.666 --> 24:43.766
with old Romeo, did it?

24:43.833 --> 24:45.566
Look, kiddo.

24:45.633 --> 24:48.700
No use preaching safe sex
at this stage.

24:48.766 --> 24:52.133
So you have no choice except to
put your baby up for adoption.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.833
'I could never give my baby
up to a stranger.'

24:55.900 --> 24:57.500
I know it hurts.

24:57.566 --> 24:59.166
But I'm here
to tell you the truth.

24:59.233 --> 25:01.000
Not to make you feel better.

25:01.066 --> 25:04.500
Look, you'll ruin your life,
you'll ruin your baby's life.

25:04.566 --> 25:07.433
Unless you do the smart thing.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.766
This is Springwood's own
Dr. Sherry Gamble on Lifeline

25:10.833 --> 25:12.733
giving advice
and telling it straight.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.466
Remind me, never to call you
if I get pregnant.

25:15.533 --> 25:18.000
If you got pregnant,
I'd call the circus.

25:23.733 --> 25:26.433
This show is
about to be cancelled.

25:26.500 --> 25:29.600
Too much dead air.

25:29.666 --> 25:31.033
Next call.

25:32.733 --> 25:34.433
I'm sorry.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.700
Your mom won't talk to you
until she gets off the air.

25:37.766 --> 25:40.833
And I bet you thought that she
was just a bitch on the radio.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.000
I'll take care of her.

25:43.066 --> 25:44.800
Come on.

25:44.866 --> 25:48.133
Why don't you
just sit down?

25:48.200 --> 25:50.200
Get yourself
a cup of coffee.

25:53.466 --> 25:55.166
'Oh, come on, honey'

25:55.233 --> 25:56.666
'nobody wears a string bikini'

25:56.733 --> 25:58.200
'to a college pool party unless'

25:58.266 --> 26:00.300
'they want their
merchandise handled.'

26:09.800 --> 26:11.133
Sherry Gamble's Lifeline.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.966
What subject would you like
to discuss with the doctor?

26:13.033 --> 26:15.700
Hal, it's me Barbara Gamble.
I need to talk to my mother.

26:15.766 --> 26:17.766
Come on, Barbara.
You know the rules.

26:17.833 --> 26:19.866
Not until she's through.

26:19.933 --> 26:21.033
Sorry.

26:26.933 --> 26:28.333
Sherry Gamble's Lifeline.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.866
What subject would you like
to discuss with the doctor?

26:30.933 --> 26:34.633
This is...Wendy.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.300
I'm in trouble with the police.

26:36.366 --> 26:38.666
'They think
I've attempted murder.'

26:38.733 --> 26:40.133
'I really need
the doctor's advice.'

26:40.200 --> 26:42.300
Eileen, it's straight.

26:42.366 --> 26:44.933
Hold the line,
and I'll put you on next, Wendy.

26:46.633 --> 26:48.933
Got a Wendy on line two.
Accused of murder.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.100
Hmm.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.666
We've got Wendy on the line.
Okay, Wendy.

26:53.733 --> 26:55.033
What's this
about killing somebody?

26:55.100 --> 26:57.400
I didn't kill anybody.

26:57.466 --> 26:59.366
I just went next door
to use the phone

26:59.433 --> 27:02.100
and the guy that lived there
fell out of the window.

27:02.166 --> 27:04.033
I guess it was an accident.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.566
But the police think
that I'm responsible.

27:06.633 --> 27:09.966
They are investigating me
for attempted murder.

27:10.033 --> 27:11.333
Sounds like an accident.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.200
Just get your parents
to call a good lawyer.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.533
That's the main problem.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.700
It's like I don't even
have any parents.

27:19.766 --> 27:21.533
My real dad's long gone.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.733
My stepdad's always away.

27:23.800 --> 27:27.933
My mother,
she's always too busy.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.933
Like today, she wouldn't take my
call because she was working.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.200
Come on, Weepy Wendy.

27:34.266 --> 27:36.900
Let's not lay the self-pity
on too thick.

27:36.966 --> 27:39.900
Just sit down with your mom
after she gets off work.

27:39.966 --> 27:41.100
She'll take care of the problem.

27:41.166 --> 27:42.700
You don't get it.

27:42.766 --> 27:45.800
She never has time.

27:45.866 --> 27:49.133
She's working
on her third marriage.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.033
So she's either going through
a divorce, a romance

27:53.100 --> 27:56.200
or a period of adjustment.

27:56.266 --> 27:59.366
And then there's her
precious work.

27:59.433 --> 28:02.100
- There's nothing left for me.
- Yeah.

28:02.166 --> 28:04.333
I'm starting to get the picture.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.733
It's sad, but you have
to look out for yourself.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.800
Nobody else is going to.

28:11.100 --> 28:14.700
I just want her to talk to me.

28:14.766 --> 28:16.733
I want her to care about me.

28:16.800 --> 28:20.400
Fantasy time.
Your mom obviously doesn't care.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.666
Never cared and never will care.
You are an orphan.

28:23.733 --> 28:27.533
Start making your
own decisions.

28:27.600 --> 28:31.733
Thanks, mom. That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

28:37.866 --> 28:40.833
Next call is Paul, says
he's losing his apartment.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.366
Sherry, you there?

28:42.433 --> 28:44.400
Oh, yeah, yeah. Um.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.633
Okay, Paul.
I hear you're moving.

28:48.700 --> 28:50.033
Take my advice.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.100
Use this as a chance
to make a fresh start.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.100
Moving is good for the soul.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.466
What are you
talking about, lady?

28:56.533 --> 28:59.100
I'm losing my apartment
because I got laid off my job.

28:59.166 --> 29:01.766
'I had to send my wife and kids
to live with their grandmother.'

29:01.833 --> 29:05.400
Okay, I know it's tough,
you'll get another job.

29:05.466 --> 29:08.733
I've been trying for six months.
My landlord is at the door.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.766
I mean, he's pounding at the
door right now, do you hear me?

29:11.833 --> 29:13.866
The grim reaper, man.

29:13.933 --> 29:16.833
Maybe you should've tried
harder getting another job.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.600
You gotta stop feeling
sorry for yourself, Paul.

29:19.666 --> 29:21.833
Thousands of other guys have
been laid off, just like you.

29:21.900 --> 29:24.066
Yeah, well,
they don't have a, a gun.

29:24.133 --> 29:25.566
And they're not about
to shoot their landlord

29:25.633 --> 29:27.000
when he walks through
that door.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.300
So, Doctor Fix-it

29:28.366 --> 29:31.333
give me a reason not to blow
that sleazebag away.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.966
Come on, who are you kidding?

29:34.033 --> 29:36.233
I said give me
a reason not to shoot.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.733
Okay, joke is over.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.266
There're regulations, you know.

29:40.333 --> 29:43.400
'This is no joke, lady.'

29:43.466 --> 29:47.366
Okay, look, if you want
advice, that's fine.

29:47.433 --> 29:49.266
But if you wanna treat
my show as a joke

29:49.333 --> 29:51.300
I don't have time for you.

29:51.366 --> 29:53.433
So you agree,
I should kill him?

29:53.500 --> 29:56.000
I don't have the time for you.
Do what you want.

29:56.066 --> 29:58.800
- Do what I want?
- Yes!

29:58.866 --> 30:00.233
Okay.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.366
- 'Yeah, I'm gonna pull that.'
- 'Hey, hey. Hey!'

30:05.433 --> 30:06.433
'I did it!'

30:06.500 --> 30:09.300
'He's dead,
the sucker's dead!'

30:10.600 --> 30:11.866
Ugh!

30:11.933 --> 30:14.866
Well, whoever that sicko was
out there that pulled this prank

30:14.933 --> 30:16.966
I want you to know, you only
made a fool of yourself.

30:17.033 --> 30:20.033
Line seven wants to discuss
the previous caller.

30:20.100 --> 30:22.300
Well, it'll be great
for ratings whoever he was.

30:26.100 --> 30:28.300
Hi, you're on the air
with Sherry Gamble.

30:28.366 --> 30:30.900
'That was my husband.'

30:30.966 --> 30:33.433
'You let him commit murder.'

30:33.500 --> 30:36.333
'He phoned you for help,
you could've saved him.'

30:39.966 --> 30:41.733
Sherry, we went to a
three-minute commercial break.

30:41.800 --> 30:42.766
Sounds like you need it.

30:42.833 --> 30:44.100
You're coming off
a 60-hour week.

30:44.166 --> 30:45.633
Believe me,
you need this break.

30:45.700 --> 30:46.933
Go get some air, okay?

30:55.233 --> 30:58.333
Hal, Hal!

30:59.933 --> 31:03.366
Come on, where is everybody?

31:03.433 --> 31:06.166
What is this, a joke?

31:06.233 --> 31:09.200
Roger, come on.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.833
Hey! Where is everybody?

31:14.166 --> 31:18.833
Hello, hey, are we
still in business here?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.233
Hello, Springwood Radio.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.966
'You won't get away with this.'

31:27.033 --> 31:28.700
'You ruined my husband.'

31:28.766 --> 31:31.366
'I'm gonna get you,
do you hear me?'

31:31.433 --> 31:32.633
Who is this?

31:32.700 --> 31:34.433
Your executioner!

31:43.033 --> 31:45.500
Help! Roger!

31:46.200 --> 31:48.766
Roger, help!

31:48.833 --> 31:49.900
Help.

31:49.966 --> 31:54.500
Ah, oh, oh. God.

31:54.566 --> 31:55.566
Hal!

31:55.633 --> 31:59.700
Hal can't help you now.
Nobody can, nobody.

32:03.100 --> 32:05.600
- Hello.
- 'Is this Sherry Gamble?'

32:05.666 --> 32:08.133
Yes, listen whoever
you are listen to me.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.433
Someone's trying to kill me,
please call the police.

32:10.500 --> 32:13.200
- 'Hi, this is Weepy Wendy.'
- Oh, God!

32:13.266 --> 32:16.100
'Please tell me what to do, my
mother won't answer my calls.'

32:19.633 --> 32:21.466
'Springwood Police,
emergency line.'

32:21.533 --> 32:23.900
For God's sake, help me!

32:23.966 --> 32:25.933
'All lines are busy.
Please hold.'

32:34.000 --> 32:36.100
'Springwood Police. State
your name and location please.'

32:36.166 --> 32:37.733
Oh, thank God,
this is Sherry Gamble

32:37.800 --> 32:38.800
of Springwood Radio.

32:38.866 --> 32:40.633
Please, someone's
trying to kill me.

32:40.700 --> 32:43.200
'This is Dr. Sherry Gamble,
the radio psychologist?'

32:43.266 --> 32:44.633
Yes, hurry!

32:44.700 --> 32:46.666
'If you need help,
call yourself.'

32:58.166 --> 32:59.433
Sherry?

33:01.400 --> 33:03.033
- Oh.
- Sherry?

33:03.100 --> 33:05.533
You must be suffering
from shock, here drink this.

33:08.700 --> 33:10.166
Shock?

33:10.233 --> 33:12.533
Well, the killing,
I just told you.

33:12.600 --> 33:16.233
That guy Paul, actually shot
his landlord on your show.

33:16.300 --> 33:17.466
Oh, my God.

33:17.533 --> 33:19.166
I thought it was a prank.

33:19.233 --> 33:22.400
Well, um, I'll have to mak
some sort of announcement.

33:22.466 --> 33:23.700
I mean, we have to
say something.

33:23.766 --> 33:25.566
Yes, but you're not
saying it.

33:25.633 --> 33:27.533
We're taking you off the air
until all this is cleared up.

33:27.600 --> 33:28.933
What are you talking about

33:29.000 --> 33:30.266
You can't do that!

33:30.333 --> 33:31.633
We're getting dozens
of phone calls.

33:31.700 --> 33:33.266
The FCC is going to
investigate us.

33:33.333 --> 33:34.300
And I'm sorry, Sherry.

33:34.366 --> 33:35.800
I made this station,
number one.

33:35.866 --> 33:37.066
I know, I know.

33:37.133 --> 33:38.866
Since you became
the acid-tongued shrink

33:38.933 --> 33:40.266
we've hit the roof.

33:40.333 --> 33:42.233
But tonight you went too far.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.333
Besides you are working
way too hard.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.400
It's beginning to show.

33:45.466 --> 33:47.933
- I can handle it.
- Handle it?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.866
You can't handle
your own daughter.

33:49.933 --> 33:53.900
Hey, Sherry. I got that girl
Weepy Wendy on the line.

33:53.966 --> 33:55.466
She says she needs
to talk to you.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.233
Put her on hold.
Forever.

34:06.733 --> 34:09.666
- Sherry Gamble?
- What?

34:09.733 --> 34:11.633
I have a warrant
for your arrest.

34:14.033 --> 34:17.600
Accessory to the murder
of Hector Maze.

34:17.666 --> 34:20.600
He's the guy your
telephone caller shot.

34:30.166 --> 34:31.700
Yeah?

34:31.766 --> 34:33.833
Where is Glatzer?

34:33.900 --> 34:36.933
Is he or is he not my lawyer?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.833
I wanna get outta here now!

34:40.033 --> 34:41.533
Hello?

34:41.600 --> 34:43.100
Hello!

34:44.466 --> 34:47.233
I still cannot reach my lawyer.

34:47.300 --> 34:48.800
That's because he resigned.

34:48.866 --> 34:50.200
He doesn't want the case.

34:50.266 --> 34:51.800
You're too unpopular.

34:54.633 --> 34:55.600
Clancy.

34:58.100 --> 35:01.966
Some girl named Weepy Wendy.

35:02.033 --> 35:04.300
Says she needs to
talk to you.

35:05.633 --> 35:07.966
Look, I don't know
who you are

35:08.033 --> 35:09.466
or how you found me,
but I can't help--

35:11.600 --> 35:12.533
You'll hold?

35:14.700 --> 35:16.333
'Well, you're gonna
have a long wait.'

35:19.733 --> 35:23.266
Look, I'll arrange my own bail.
How much is it?

35:23.333 --> 35:24.633
No bail.

35:26.633 --> 35:30.133
We're holding you
in protective custody.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.233
Half this town
wants to lynch you.

35:32.300 --> 35:36.366
You're the most hated person in
Springwood since Freddy Krueger.

35:46.933 --> 35:48.966
And in summation, Your Honor

35:49.033 --> 35:51.000
we, the people

35:51.066 --> 35:53.833
demand the death penalty!

35:57.200 --> 35:59.833
'Order. Alright.'

35:59.900 --> 36:01.300
'I've heard enough.'

36:01.366 --> 36:03.400
'Young man, no matter what'

36:03.466 --> 36:06.333
Dr. Gamble said to you
on the radio

36:06.400 --> 36:09.300
you must be responsible
for your actions.

36:09.366 --> 36:13.500
'I sentence you
to die by firing squad'

36:13.566 --> 36:16.666
just like you killed
that poor man.

36:16.733 --> 36:19.433
Dr. Gamble, please approach
the bench.

36:25.766 --> 36:27.033
Here!

36:29.400 --> 36:33.233
'You are partly responsible
for this mess'

36:33.300 --> 36:37.166
so you carry out the execution.

36:37.233 --> 36:38.200
What?

36:38.266 --> 36:41.066
I said, execute the man.

36:42.933 --> 36:45.000
Oh, you can't be serious.

36:47.266 --> 36:49.533
I'm not an executioner.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.933
I'm a radio psychologist.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.833
Really? Roll the tape.

36:53.900 --> 36:56.233
'I don't have time for you.
Do what you want.'

36:56.300 --> 36:58.466
'I don't have time for you.'

36:58.533 --> 37:00.000
'Now, shoot.'

37:02.733 --> 37:05.133
Oh, I...I can't.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.333
You have to.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.233
I order it.

37:10.233 --> 37:13.200
Or do you want to go
to prison for life?

37:15.666 --> 37:18.066
Please don't.
I came to you for help.

37:18.133 --> 37:20.766
Is this how
you treat your callers?

37:26.066 --> 37:29.133
Back on Lifeline, Hal Linwood,
sitting in for Sherry Gamble

37:29.200 --> 37:30.833
'who's on extended leave.'

37:30.900 --> 37:32.966
Extended leave, right.

37:33.033 --> 37:36.666
Our next caller is Wendy.

37:36.733 --> 37:38.800
So, what it be like?
How can I help you, Wendy?

37:38.866 --> 37:41.866
'First, I just wanna say how
great you are with everyone.'

37:41.933 --> 37:45.700
'I mean, that witch Dr. Gamble
was terrible to me.'

37:45.766 --> 37:49.600
'She kept putting me on hold,
calling me Weepy Wendy.'

37:49.666 --> 37:51.933
Well, let's just say
Sherry has her approach

37:52.000 --> 37:53.166
and I have mine.

37:53.233 --> 37:54.400
Well, let me get
the next caller, okay?

37:54.466 --> 37:55.466
'I'll get back with you.'

37:55.533 --> 37:58.300
Back stabbing son of a bitch!

37:58.366 --> 38:00.333
Get me out of here!

38:26.166 --> 38:27.600
Killed herself.

38:27.666 --> 38:28.733
Oh.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.400
Oh, God, oh.

38:30.466 --> 38:33.333
Take it easy, it's a good thing
I got here, when I did.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.000
I couldn't take it in here

38:35.066 --> 38:36.700
You won't have to stay
any longer.

38:36.766 --> 38:38.966
The judge just
threw out the case.

38:39.033 --> 38:40.433
Lack of evidence.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.900
- You're free to go.
- Oh, thank you.

38:45.766 --> 38:48.833
Barbara, Barbara.

38:51.266 --> 38:52.433
Anybody?

38:55.166 --> 38:56.833
Anybody home?

39:05.300 --> 39:07.000
Barbara?

39:07.066 --> 39:09.300
'Now Barbara is your daughter.'

39:09.366 --> 39:11.033
'Your daughter has a father.'

39:11.100 --> 39:13.166
'My children are homeless
and fatherless.'

39:13.233 --> 39:15.400
'I'm going to kill you,
like you killed him.'

39:36.933 --> 39:39.033
- Yes.
- 'Sherry, is that you?'

39:39.100 --> 39:40.866
- 'Roger.'
- Oh!

39:40.933 --> 39:42.500
Oh, Roger, thank God.

39:42.566 --> 39:44.300
'You sound a little down.'

39:44.366 --> 39:46.400
'But I've got some news for you
that'll perk you right up.'

39:46.466 --> 39:48.000
'You're going back
on the air.'

39:48.066 --> 39:49.166
- 'Tonight.'
- Oh.

39:49.233 --> 39:50.533
You're putting me back on?

39:50.600 --> 39:52.133
'With everything
cleared up, why not?'

39:52.200 --> 39:54.633
'We need you down here pronto.'

39:54.700 --> 39:56.633
I'll be, I'll be right there.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.933
Oh, ho ho ho!

40:06.000 --> 40:07.300
My star.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.433
Aww!

40:08.500 --> 40:10.133
Go get 'em, tiger.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.000
Love you, doll.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.900
'Got that Weepy Wendy
girl on line eight.'

40:18.966 --> 40:21.200
Ugh, not my first call.

40:21.266 --> 40:23.600
Put her on hold,
I'll get to her later.

40:24.366 --> 40:25.666
Okay.

40:25.733 --> 40:27.033
Caller on five says
he's involved

40:27.100 --> 40:28.700
with a hard-nose woman.

40:28.766 --> 40:30.200
Name's Andrew.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.033
So, Andrew, what's the problem

40:34.100 --> 40:36.733
with a hard-nosed
sensible woman?

40:36.800 --> 40:39.966
'Nothing. But this lady
steered me wrong.'

40:40.033 --> 40:42.766
See, I went to her for help
but she sandbagged me.

40:42.833 --> 40:44.266
Gave me bad advice.

40:44.333 --> 40:45.400
What kind of advice?

40:45.466 --> 40:48.566
About my landlord.
About my life.

40:48.633 --> 40:51.466
'Can you believe, this woman
told me to shoot my landlord?'

40:51.533 --> 40:55.366
- Who is this?
- It's me, you bitch.

40:55.433 --> 40:59.133
I'm going to rip
your face off your skull.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.200
This is Dr. Gamble.
What's your name?

41:01.266 --> 41:02.966
Paul.

41:03.033 --> 41:04.933
Paul.

41:09.766 --> 41:11.433
This is Dr. Gamble,
who is this?

41:11.500 --> 41:13.833
You screwed me, lady.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.433
This is Dr. Gamble,
who is this?

41:15.500 --> 41:16.833
Who do you think?

41:19.533 --> 41:21.733
This is Dr. Gamble,
who is this?

41:21.800 --> 41:24.433
'This is Jill.'

41:24.500 --> 41:27.366
Go ahead, Jill.
How can I help you?

41:27.433 --> 41:28.600
'It's about my husband.'

41:28.666 --> 41:30.533
'He's in terrible trouble.'

41:30.600 --> 41:33.133
What kind of trouble?
Maybe I can help.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.066
'Well, a professional counselor
gave him bad advice.'

41:36.133 --> 41:38.466
'And now he's dead,
because he shot his landlord!'

41:38.533 --> 41:41.800
- Who is this?
- 'The Grim Stalker.'

41:41.866 --> 41:43.366
'Stalker!'

42:02.400 --> 42:05.233
'This is Springwood's own
Dr. Sherry Gamble on Lifeline.'

42:05.300 --> 42:08.100
Giving advice
and telling it straight.

42:08.166 --> 42:09.833
You're on, what's your name?

42:09.900 --> 42:11.900
'Mrs. Sherry Gamble.'

42:11.966 --> 42:13.700
What can I do for you, Sherry?

42:13.766 --> 42:15.100
'My life's falling apart.'

42:15.166 --> 42:19.533
'I used to be a well-known
radio psychologist.'

42:19.600 --> 42:21.533
'And now I'm out of work.'

42:21.600 --> 42:22.766
'People are helming me.'

42:22.833 --> 42:24.433
'Blaming me for things
that I didn't do.'

42:24.500 --> 42:27.266
Oh, let's get our facts
straight here, Sherry.

42:27.333 --> 42:29.466
First of all, you were
never well-liked.

42:29.533 --> 42:31.366
Most people thought
you were an obnoxious bitch.

42:31.433 --> 42:34.733
And that includes
your own daughter.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.833
But everybody listened
to my show.

42:36.900 --> 42:38.300
I was number one.

42:38.366 --> 42:40.066
Look in a mirror, sweetheart.

42:40.133 --> 42:43.000
Everyone's laughing at you.
You're a joke in this town.

42:43.066 --> 42:45.633
What about all those people
who call me, what about them?

42:45.700 --> 42:48.333
Bottom of the barrel,
sweetheart.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.500
Social misfits, psychos,
juvenile delinquents

42:51.566 --> 42:52.566
mental defectives.

42:52.633 --> 42:55.700
You're an outcast.
You're a nothing!

42:55.766 --> 42:58.633
What can I do?
I wanna change.

43:00.033 --> 43:02.866
We don't have time to go
into that now, sorry.

43:02.933 --> 43:05.400
Have to go
on to my next caller.

43:05.466 --> 43:06.533
No!

43:15.266 --> 43:16.900
Who's there?

43:18.933 --> 43:20.533
Hey, Earth to Sherry.

43:24.066 --> 43:26.100
Commercial break's over.
You okay?

43:26.166 --> 43:29.500
Yeah, give me
the next call.

43:29.566 --> 43:31.633
Hey, you don't look too good.

43:31.700 --> 43:33.700
Why don't you go home, huh

43:33.766 --> 43:36.433
Let me slide in
a couple of old tapes, huh

43:36.500 --> 43:39.833
Maybe you're right.
I, I've gotta clear my head.

43:48.900 --> 43:50.200
Barbara.

43:52.533 --> 43:54.133
Is that you?

43:55.566 --> 43:58.400
No, it's Weepy Wendy.

44:01.466 --> 44:03.666
Happy Mother's Day.

44:03.733 --> 44:04.666
Oh my..

44:11.100 --> 44:12.266
Mom?

44:12.333 --> 44:14.200
Barbara.

44:14.266 --> 44:16.033
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

44:16.100 --> 44:17.166
I'm in trouble.

44:17.233 --> 44:19.833
And you ignored me
as usual.

44:19.900 --> 44:21.533
It's gonna change.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.566
I am gonna change.

44:23.633 --> 44:25.733
Give me another chance.

44:26.766 --> 44:28.900
Give us a chance.

44:31.300 --> 44:32.500
Mom.

44:33.566 --> 44:35.100
Are you okay?

44:35.166 --> 44:39.433
Hey, I'm fine.
Um, let's go home, huh?

44:41.266 --> 44:42.433
Together?

44:49.500 --> 44:50.600
Come on.

44:53.566 --> 44:56.533
This shrink really
oughta have her head examined.
