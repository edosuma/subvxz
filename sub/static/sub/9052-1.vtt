01:48.125 --> 01:50.499
1959, Hong Kong.

01:50.583 --> 01:52.707
Ip Man's older son was
studying in Foshan.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.790
Ip Man lived in Hong Kong with
his wife and younger son.

01:54.875 --> 01:59.107
He taught Wing Chun and
promoted the martial arts.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.990
Master Ip, Morning.

02:12.125 --> 02:13.965
So early?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.874
Master Ip, it's me.

02:17.833 --> 02:21.015
You don't recognise me?

02:22.208 --> 02:23.790
So long.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.957
When I was little, I
asked to learn from you.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.582
You said: grow up first.

02:27.625 --> 02:31.590
Please take me as a disciple.

02:32.083 --> 02:34.549
Why should I accept you?

02:34.625 --> 02:37.299
Because I will be your
greatest disciple.

02:43.708 --> 02:46.357
Why are you so sure?

02:46.750 --> 02:48.799
Because I'm fast.

02:58.541 --> 03:00.282
How fast?

03:19.708 --> 03:22.699
Not fast enough, kid.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.724
Can you be faster?

04:07.416 --> 04:09.157
Not bad.

04:09.250 --> 04:13.657
But did you really kick the
water or only think you did?

04:45.125 --> 04:49.374
Liquorice, liquorice.

05:01.750 --> 05:04.540
Come on, somebody is fighting.

05:04.583 --> 05:08.290
Fight. Fight.

05:08.416 --> 05:10.449
Come on.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.299
Cheung Fong of Wing Chun.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.740
Ip Ching of Wing Chun.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.182
Stop. Stop fighting.

05:37.458 --> 05:39.624
I told you two not to fight.

05:39.708 --> 05:43.357
Big trouble. It's
not the first time.

05:43.541 --> 05:48.040
Break the shell, then
remove the yolk.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.999
What's with the ring?

05:51.041 --> 05:55.432
The old folks say that adding
silver helps with bruising.

05:57.125 --> 06:01.140
So, why were you fighting today?

06:01.541 --> 06:05.749
It's always over whose
kung fu is best.

06:05.750 --> 06:08.715
I should've kept an eye on them.

06:08.791 --> 06:10.982
What a fight, they
really got hurt.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.515
It's Ching's fault.
He's so naughty.

06:13.583 --> 06:16.832
So, where is this boy's father?

06:16.916 --> 06:19.082
Cheung Fong is new here.

06:19.125 --> 06:22.699
His dad picks him up quite late.

06:22.791 --> 06:25.207
Fong, what does your dad do?

06:25.250 --> 06:27.257
Is he always so busy?

06:27.333 --> 06:29.357
Rickshaw puller.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.624
Sorry, sorry.

06:33.708 --> 06:35.332
- Sorry, Miss Wong.
- Master Ip.

06:35.375 --> 06:39.074
I was busy at the kung
fu school so I'm late.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.165
Let me see.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.590
Ah Ching, what's this about?

06:45.625 --> 06:47.749
Both kids were at fault in fact.

06:47.791 --> 06:49.932
So I wanted all the
family heads here.

06:49.958 --> 06:52.832
Right. Is Fong's dad here yet?

06:52.916 --> 06:54.732
I need to apologise to them.

06:54.791 --> 06:58.474
No, like you he's late.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.474
No problem, work comes first.

07:02.791 --> 07:04.740
- Don't eat that.
- You can't eat it.

07:04.742 --> 07:05.742
Put it down.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.740
The boy is hungry.

07:07.791 --> 07:09.415
Miss Wong, how about this?

07:09.500 --> 07:11.807
We'll give them dinner first.

07:11.833 --> 07:14.399
- Just let his father know, Okay?
- Okay.

07:14.458 --> 07:15.790
Okay, Wing-sing?

07:15.833 --> 07:17.540
Of course.

07:18.166 --> 07:21.640
Fong, have dinner with us, okay?

07:21.708 --> 07:24.907
Take your book bag.

07:25.083 --> 07:26.549
- Take care.
- We're off.

07:26.551 --> 07:27.633
Thank you.

07:27.666 --> 07:29.832
- Very kind, Master Ip.
- Sorry to trouble you.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.798
Thank you, Mrs Ip.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.508
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:34.375 --> 07:38.374
- Ah Fong, eat up, don't be shy.
- Yeah.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.649
Make yourself at
home, eat. Eat up.

07:42.708 --> 07:46.774
Darling, the fish is delicious.

08:05.583 --> 08:08.299
Cheung Fong, not bad.

08:08.375 --> 08:11.957
- Who taught you?
- My dad. Can you fight?

08:11.958 --> 08:14.399
A little.

08:22.041 --> 08:24.524
I'm Cheung Fong's dad.

08:24.583 --> 08:28.040
- Is my son here, please?
- Yes, he is.

08:28.041 --> 08:32.524
Nice to meet you, Mr
Cheung. Please, come in.

08:36.791 --> 08:39.539
Fong, your dad's here.

08:39.582 --> 08:41.740
Master.

08:42.582 --> 08:44.174
Disciple.

08:44.207 --> 08:45.932
Tell me what went on today.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.257
The kids were naughty and fought.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.690
They'll learn in time.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.657
Come here, Ah Ching.

08:54.583 --> 08:55.874
Disciple.

08:55.916 --> 08:57.540
Aren't you going to apologise?

08:57.625 --> 08:59.490
Ah Ching is at fault too.

08:59.583 --> 09:02.074
Ip Ching, I'm sorry.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.832
I'm sorry, Cheung Fong.

09:03.916 --> 09:05.749
Shake hands.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.290
Now you're friends.

09:10.916 --> 09:13.215
I've taken you out of your way.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.499
I apologise, Mr Cheung.

09:16.125 --> 09:19.540
Good to meet you, Master Ip.

09:19.541 --> 09:21.749
I saw Fong working
with the wooden man.

09:21.791 --> 09:24.732
He's good. He's been taught well.

09:24.791 --> 09:26.874
Too kind.

09:26.958 --> 09:29.457
But it's late. You should rest.

09:29.458 --> 09:32.032
I'll see you off.

09:35.166 --> 09:39.474
Master, Uncle Ip has
a wooden man too.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.532
Do you know him?

09:41.583 --> 09:42.749
Yes.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.557
Uncle Ip is very famous.

09:45.625 --> 09:50.132
But one day, I'll be more famous.

09:50.166 --> 09:54.440
Which of you is better at kung fu?

09:54.500 --> 09:56.349
Who do you think?

09:56.375 --> 09:58.974
You, of course.

10:01.583 --> 10:03.607
Let's go.

10:03.708 --> 10:07.049
- Give me a look, does it hurt?
- No.

10:10.125 --> 10:12.949
It's about to start. Hurry. Hurry.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.115
Bet on the winner.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.790
- I told you to follow my lead.
- Great.

10:16.875 --> 10:19.257
One at a time.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.324
Bigger bets, bigger wins.

10:21.416 --> 10:24.624
Move, out of the way.

10:27.791 --> 10:32.940
Cheung Tin-Chi. Cheung Tin-Chi.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.824
How are you doing?

10:59.333 --> 11:01.582
Come on, come on.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.140
Brother Sang. Brother Sang.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.540
- The boss is here.
- What?

11:06.583 --> 11:09.107
The boss is here.

11:10.375 --> 11:13.024
Not bad, kid. Go.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.824
Hit hard, fast.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.865
Hey boss.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.157
Come on.

11:26.208 --> 11:29.465
- Wait here, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

11:38.333 --> 11:42.657
Boss, don't worry.

11:42.666 --> 11:46.907
I've got it under control.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.332
Two week's money.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.007
- Open it.
- Okay.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.057
You did good.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.532
- Thank you.
- What about that other business?

12:00.583 --> 12:01.949
The school?

12:01.958 --> 12:04.074
No problem. Give me one month.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.157
No. Two weeks.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.699
Come on.

12:09.416 --> 12:11.607
Okay, I love a challenge.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.957
Deal you.

12:14.833 --> 12:17.082
Remember, I want that school.

12:17.125 --> 12:19.040
The rest means nothing without it.

12:19.125 --> 12:21.532
Yes, understood.

12:26.291 --> 12:29.615
- What kind of kung fu is that?
- Wing Chun.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.049
It's really powerful.

12:44.666 --> 12:47.540
Martial artists come
here every day.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.657
We chat, drink tea...

12:49.666 --> 12:53.449
Each school has its own table.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.265
Master Tin.

12:55.291 --> 12:58.315
- Master Chan, a rising star.
- Master Tin.

12:58.375 --> 13:01.440
He has a lot of students.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.232
Master Chan.

13:03.291 --> 13:06.665
Now this table is amazing,
the best of the best.

13:06.708 --> 13:08.207
It's my table.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.290
Master Tin.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.665
Just kidding.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.415
The real champions sit there.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.915
That's Wing Chun table.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.540
Master Tin.

13:16.625 --> 13:19.865
Ah Lik, where's your master?

13:19.958 --> 13:21.807
There he is.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.340
Master Ip.

13:26.083 --> 13:29.599
- Master Tin, have you eaten?
- No, your treat?

13:29.625 --> 13:31.249
Of course.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.582
You know Master Ip?

13:33.666 --> 13:35.249
- Master Ip, hello. I'm Lee.
- How do you do.

13:35.291 --> 13:36.415
- Mr Lee.
- Hello.

13:36.458 --> 13:40.874
Lee is a reporter and keen
to write about martial arts.

13:40.958 --> 13:42.332
He takes photos as well.

13:42.416 --> 13:43.874
- Great.
- Fine with you, Master Ip?

13:43.916 --> 13:45.099
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

13:45.166 --> 13:47.682
- Master Lee, right here.
- Too kind.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.165
- Ip Man, the centre seat.
- No, no.

13:49.208 --> 13:51.207
- It's yours.
- No, really.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.749
No it's fitting, sit down.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.549
Master Ip, telephone.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.457
I take that if it's okay.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.665
Sure, we'll save your seat.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.699
We'll wait.

14:03.208 --> 14:04.649
Hello?

14:05.083 --> 14:08.082
Did you forget our date?

14:08.083 --> 14:09.324
Wasn't it for...

14:09.416 --> 14:10.957
For today.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.882
Today...

14:13.416 --> 14:14.457
Oh, I'll rush right over.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.999
I've been waiting an hour.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.915
The dancing is almost over.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.249
So don't bother.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.815
Just pick up Ah Ching from school.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.249
Oh, I'm in trouble.

14:33.291 --> 14:36.424
- Master Ip, please.
- Sit down.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.207
Here, the middle seat.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.457
- Okay, I give in.
- And why not?

14:40.500 --> 14:43.582
Look sharp, eyes front,
hold still. Ready...

14:43.583 --> 14:46.240
One, two, three.

14:49.791 --> 14:51.790
Master Ip.

14:51.833 --> 14:54.099
- Hello.
- You're here for your son?

14:54.125 --> 14:56.590
- Where's your wife?
- She's busy today.

14:56.666 --> 14:59.624
And you're not? It's okay...

14:59.750 --> 15:03.549
Master Ip, you look
younger by the day.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.682
Must be his wife's cooking.

15:05.708 --> 15:07.165
Such tender meat.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.832
Such a lucky couple.

15:09.916 --> 15:11.690
Master Ip.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.290
Mr Cheung.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.440
- Hello.
- Hello.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.499
- Picking up your son?
- Yes.

15:20.583 --> 15:24.874
Oh, this medicine
helps with bruises.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.415
It's for your son.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.682
Thank you, that's so nice.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.999
- How is Fong?
- He is fine.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.957
I'm glad.

15:35.041 --> 15:39.915
Master Ip, I hear you studied
with Chan Wah Shun, yes?

15:40.041 --> 15:43.090
- Yes.
- So we're both from the school of

15:43.091 --> 15:46.357
Foshan's Grandmaster Leung Jan.

15:46.666 --> 15:50.749
So we are truly brothers-in-arms.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.582
I heard that Chan
used fists and pole

15:54.666 --> 15:59.590
better than swords and
feet. Is that true?

15:59.625 --> 16:03.665
Having strengths and
weaknesses is normal.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.140
How about you, Master Ip?

16:07.416 --> 16:09.882
I'm just a dabbler.

16:13.083 --> 16:19.474
If we have the chance, let's
have a friendly match.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.290
Sure.

16:26.375 --> 16:27.415
Bye, Miss.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.665
Be careful.

16:29.708 --> 16:31.974
- Master.
- Disciple.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.290
What did you learn today?

16:36.333 --> 16:37.832
- Mathematics.
- Mathematics?

16:37.875 --> 16:39.790
Chinese, English.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.207
How'd you do?

16:41.209 --> 16:43.820
- Did you behave?
- That's all.

16:43.822 --> 16:44.892
Yes.

16:49.875 --> 16:53.399
- Do you go to school?
- Nup.

16:54.875 --> 16:58.665
Principal, this man
is asking for you.

16:58.666 --> 17:00.180
How may I help you?

17:00.182 --> 17:01.775
- Hey.
- Move it.

17:01.833 --> 17:04.415
- What's going on?
- Sit, don't move.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.265
- Don't move.
- Looking at me?

17:06.333 --> 17:07.707
Fatty, calm down.

17:07.790 --> 17:11.057
How can I talk over your noise?

17:11.125 --> 17:12.874
So sorry, sir, we
gave you a fright.

17:12.915 --> 17:14.002
What's going on?

17:14.003 --> 17:15.633
- Come, sit down.
- Make room.

17:15.708 --> 17:18.140
Don't be afraid.

17:18.165 --> 17:20.040
You're a scholar, I'm a gentleman.

17:20.125 --> 17:22.332
We're reasonable people.

17:22.415 --> 17:24.906
This is prime real estate.

17:24.915 --> 17:26.824
Sell your school to me.
It's a fair offer.

17:26.833 --> 17:29.640
"Contract of Sale".

17:29.708 --> 17:32.740
Won't you even read
it first? Go on.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.040
I'm not selling.

17:35.125 --> 17:38.999
Educated people are a pain.

17:42.208 --> 17:45.132
They don't do as told.

17:52.750 --> 17:57.640
- Watch out, Boss.
- What's going on?

17:57.833 --> 18:00.699
They're forcing me
to sell the school.

18:00.791 --> 18:04.557
Think I don't know kung fu?

18:08.416 --> 18:13.082
Ip Man, it's a business deal.

18:16.166 --> 18:18.999
Keep your damn nose out of it.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.040
Hello, this is Chi
Yan Primary School.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.732
We need police here right now.

18:23.750 --> 18:27.590
Some thugs are causing trouble.

18:27.708 --> 18:29.624
- Cut it out.
- Let him go.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.490
Let my boss go or I'll whack her.

18:33.541 --> 18:36.374
- Let my boss go, now.
- Let him go.

18:36.458 --> 18:39.274
- Do it.
- Let him go.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.099
Don't rush, take your time.

18:41.125 --> 18:44.615
Start from the beginning.

18:44.625 --> 18:48.707
The three just barged in and
began smashing things up.

18:48.708 --> 18:52.749
Hong Kong seems prosperous
but really it's a mess.

18:52.791 --> 18:55.199
More wealth means more crime.

18:55.208 --> 18:58.690
We're like Cyclops with his wife.
Can't always keep an eye on her.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.437
Truth is, we're understaffed
and insanely busy.

19:01.438 --> 19:02.438
Yeah.

19:02.439 --> 19:04.832
Hong Kong's crime
rate is going up.

19:04.875 --> 19:08.032
- It seems pretty lawless.
- No, we still have law.

19:08.083 --> 19:12.449
Call the police and we come.
We'll crack this case.

19:12.541 --> 19:14.528
The bastards won't
get away with it.

19:14.529 --> 19:15.529
Yes. Yes.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.307
We're relying on you, Sergeant Po.

19:17.333 --> 19:21.665
Of course, it's my duty. But
Master Ip, you know the score.

19:21.708 --> 19:24.499
The police can't keep
watching here all day.

19:24.541 --> 19:27.240
We need your help. Tell
people to be careful.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.457
- I will.
- Anything happens, call us.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.540
- I'll come straight away. Okay?
- Great, thank you.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.665
- You're welcome. Let's go, men.
- Yes, sir.

19:33.708 --> 19:37.624
- See you.
- Take care.

19:44.041 --> 19:46.365
Ip Man,

19:47.125 --> 19:49.857
you piss me off.

19:49.875 --> 19:52.957
I'm gonna do you slowly.

19:53.041 --> 19:55.757
Brother Sang.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.649
Chain up the school tonight.

20:01.666 --> 20:05.107
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.540
It's okay.

20:08.666 --> 20:12.890
Don't worry, the
school won't shut.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.082
Principal.

20:15.791 --> 20:17.907
Principal.

20:18.416 --> 20:20.407
Miss Wong. Master Ip.

20:20.416 --> 20:21.765
Miss Wong. Master Ip.

20:21.791 --> 20:22.832
What's going on?

20:22.916 --> 20:24.890
It was like this when I got here.

20:24.916 --> 20:26.790
Will they demolish the school?

20:26.875 --> 20:31.632
How will our kids
get an education?

20:40.666 --> 20:43.607
Dad, open the gate.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.357
I'll help you. Be careful.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.665
You're really strong.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.057
Can't I be skinny and strong?

20:54.375 --> 20:55.874
Sure.

20:55.916 --> 20:58.774
I'm big but not that strong.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.882
My name is Hui Lik.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.349
They call me Miss Wong.

21:01.416 --> 21:05.265
Call me if you need help.

21:07.458 --> 21:10.324
Come in. Morning, granny.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.765
Morning, Principal.

21:12.833 --> 21:15.565
- Morning, Miss Wong.
- Morning.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.582
Master.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.665
Let's go.

21:20.708 --> 21:24.040
They'll be back for sure.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.515
Then wait here for them.

21:28.541 --> 21:30.065
Okay.

21:32.458 --> 21:36.107
- Tonight we're staying here.
- Good.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.865
Miss Wong, fancy
meeting you again.

22:02.916 --> 22:05.474
- Yes, can I help you?
- No.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.565
May I ask do you have a boyfriend?

22:08.625 --> 22:10.082
No.

22:10.125 --> 22:11.249
Great.

22:11.291 --> 22:14.474
Would you like a boyfriend?

22:14.583 --> 22:17.032
Haven't thought about it.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.290
Don't get me wrong, but it's dark.

22:19.333 --> 22:23.332
You shouldn't walk home alone.

22:24.041 --> 22:25.882
I'm sorry.

22:25.958 --> 22:27.207
Master Ip.

22:27.250 --> 22:30.207
Hello, Miss Wong.

22:30.375 --> 22:33.731
We've put you to a lot of trouble.

22:33.732 --> 22:35.182
It's nothing.

22:35.625 --> 22:38.190
Is my disciple giving you trouble?

22:38.208 --> 22:40.890
No, Master Ip. Not at all.

22:40.916 --> 22:43.415
He kindly offered to see me home.

22:43.458 --> 22:46.340
That's all it was, Master.

22:46.583 --> 22:49.332
Why don't you see me home then?

22:49.375 --> 22:51.099
Okay.

22:51.125 --> 22:53.082
Hey, let's see Master
Ip home tonight.

22:53.125 --> 22:55.107
- Sure, it's pretty quiet.
- Okay.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.665
Master Ip, you did a
lot for us today.

22:57.708 --> 23:00.124
- You should get some rest.
- I'm fine.

23:00.166 --> 23:04.440
I didn't have any other plans.

23:07.708 --> 23:09.149
Hey.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.415
Hurry.

23:13.916 --> 23:16.457
You guys, over there.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.384
Help, Master Ip.

23:48.386 --> 23:50.116
- Take him.
- Help.

23:50.166 --> 23:53.032
Protect Miss Wong.

24:08.583 --> 24:09.583
You okay?

24:09.601 --> 24:11.149
Yup, but we're definitely
seeing you home.

24:11.208 --> 24:13.407
- Up there.
- Okay.

24:30.666 --> 24:32.540
Help.

24:33.208 --> 24:35.174
Move.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.407
Let's go, men.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.624
We checked everywhere;
the fire's out.

26:03.666 --> 26:05.472
Make sure there's no live embers.

26:05.473 --> 26:06.473
Okay.

26:06.474 --> 26:08.940
- Go double-check.
- Okay.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.815
Master, the fire's extinguished.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.549
But nothing's left but ash.

26:15.625 --> 26:19.599
Principal, are you okay?

26:19.625 --> 26:20.957
I'm fine.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.290
But I underestimated those thugs.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.749
Lucky you and your men were here.

26:25.791 --> 26:30.665
- It was nothing.
- Thank you so much, Master Ip.

26:34.208 --> 26:35.882
Mr Cheung,

26:37.583 --> 26:39.249
thank goodness you were here.

26:39.291 --> 26:40.824
I was just passing by.

26:40.875 --> 26:43.749
I finally saw your Wing Chun.

26:43.791 --> 26:46.332
- It's as good as they say.
- People are too nice.

26:46.416 --> 26:50.349
If all's well, I'll
get back to work.

26:51.458 --> 26:52.849
Bye.

26:57.291 --> 27:03.182
The people want me to stay
and help guard the area.

27:03.250 --> 27:06.290
It's arson. Aren't
the cops involved?

27:06.333 --> 27:08.540
Yes, why wouldn't they be?

27:08.541 --> 27:11.790
'Fatty' Po says they'll
crack the case.

27:11.875 --> 27:14.707
We've no reason to doubt his word.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.799
That's good.

27:17.041 --> 27:21.815
But they can't give
24-hour protection.

27:22.041 --> 27:28.249
So for a few nights I
might be out late.

27:28.250 --> 27:34.182
- Should I cook dinner then?
- Sure, what'll I eat otherwise?

27:34.708 --> 27:37.149
They can't do it without you?

27:37.166 --> 27:38.690
It's not that.

27:38.708 --> 27:42.407
But if I can help I will.

27:42.916 --> 27:44.185
It's working.

27:44.187 --> 27:47.991
Then do me a favour, turn it off.

27:52.816 --> 27:55.957
So sorry. I was having dinner.

27:55.958 --> 27:58.974
Come in, have a look.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.057
Come, have a look.

28:07.458 --> 28:09.832
The place has great feng shui.

28:09.875 --> 28:11.915
It's an oasis of calm.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.874
Only the wall is a bit chipped.

28:13.916 --> 28:18.024
You can sweep it clean.

28:19.500 --> 28:23.040
Disciple, I'll open my
kung fu school here.

28:23.083 --> 28:25.239
You'll have lots of
classmates then.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.266
Is that good?

28:26.267 --> 28:31.249
Great. I'll be able to
practise here and here.

28:31.291 --> 28:33.832
How much is a month's rent?

28:33.875 --> 28:37.140
HK$180. Water and
electricity included.

28:37.166 --> 28:41.182
I'll think it over. Thank you.

28:41.208 --> 28:45.274
Sir, the rent is negotiable.

28:46.916 --> 28:49.824
You pull a rickshaw?

28:49.833 --> 28:52.207
And you're going to run a school?

28:52.250 --> 28:54.432
As if.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.770
You're wasting my time.

28:56.772 --> 28:57.925
- Where to, boss?
- Home.

28:57.958 --> 28:58.963
Loser

29:04.375 --> 29:07.499
Sir, my report on the
school arson case.

29:07.541 --> 29:12.740
Then wait here for them,
sign and I'll follow up.

29:12.791 --> 29:15.999
Not necessary. I'm handling it.

29:16.041 --> 29:19.190
Don't be silly, it's a small
case. Too small for you, sir.

29:19.250 --> 29:21.124
Let me handle it, okay?

29:21.166 --> 29:24.099
Do you understand Chinese?

29:24.916 --> 29:27.374
The investigation into the school,

29:27.416 --> 29:32.032
I will take care of it
because I am in charge.

29:32.625 --> 29:34.674
So piss off.

29:34.750 --> 29:38.274
Get out.

29:38.583 --> 29:40.507
Yes, sir.

29:45.125 --> 29:47.649
What the hell. You blind?

29:47.708 --> 29:50.790
What's it to you? You
own the road? Idiot.

29:50.791 --> 29:54.457
- Here comes more.
- You at it again?

29:58.958 --> 30:01.449
- Brother.
- Thanks.

30:01.916 --> 30:04.665
Brother. When I was
at tea this morning,

30:04.666 --> 30:07.657
people were saying we'd
become security guards.

30:07.750 --> 30:11.490
Oh, don't worry about it.

30:11.541 --> 30:15.357
Master Ip doesn't
listen to gossip.

30:15.458 --> 30:17.340
Who said it anyway?

30:17.583 --> 30:18.999
Lots of people.

30:19.041 --> 30:21.999
Would you recognise them?

30:22.041 --> 30:23.982
Mantis?

30:41.458 --> 30:42.624
How can I help you?

30:42.666 --> 30:45.832
I often have pain in my abdomen.

30:45.875 --> 30:49.757
- Do you have anything for it?
- Yes.

30:49.833 --> 30:53.932
Crow & Phoenix Pills. They
help with circulation.

30:53.958 --> 30:56.782
Okay, I'll have a packet.

31:04.833 --> 31:07.049
- Ip Man.
- Hi.

31:07.125 --> 31:10.027
Why didn't you tell
me what happened?

31:10.028 --> 31:11.115
Have a seat.

31:11.166 --> 31:15.982
They're saying at the teahouse
you've become a security guard.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.207
That's so insulting.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.915
I bet it's that little
bastard's doing.

31:18.958 --> 31:20.782
Have some tea.

31:20.791 --> 31:24.257
I rue the day I made
Ah Sang a disciple.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.990
He uses my kung fu to do awful
things. It's disgraceful.

31:28.041 --> 31:31.524
He shames my school.

31:32.833 --> 31:35.957
See, how could I tell you?

31:36.041 --> 31:38.907
Well, I'm telling you.
I'll teach him a lesson.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.657
I'm going after him.

31:40.708 --> 31:42.524
Master Tin.

31:42.541 --> 31:44.099
Calm down.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.582
Uncle Chan, I pay for this.

31:46.583 --> 31:48.390
Master Tin.

31:48.625 --> 31:49.849
Master Tin.

31:49.875 --> 31:53.799
- Let Sergeant Po handle it.
- Too late for that.

31:53.833 --> 31:55.707
I'll take care of this myself.

31:55.750 --> 31:57.990
That little shit owes me respect.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.374
He's no longer your
responsibility.

32:00.416 --> 32:05.282
It's true that he left my school
but I'm still his teacher.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.874
Don't fret, I'll be fine.

32:06.916 --> 32:08.490
Stop. What do you want?

32:08.583 --> 32:10.374
I'm looking for Ma King-Sang.

32:10.416 --> 32:14.699
I'm his teacher. Call him out.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.740
Sergeant Po.

32:22.625 --> 32:24.749
Ah-Lik, where's Master Ip?

32:24.791 --> 32:26.415
Too late for that.

32:26.458 --> 32:29.370
Master Tin was really
furious. Not sure why.

32:29.371 --> 32:30.374
Master Tin?

32:30.375 --> 32:33.324
Now what?

32:35.541 --> 32:38.915
Why are you here, Master Ip?

32:38.958 --> 32:42.615
So I see my teacher.
What's it to you?

32:42.708 --> 32:46.357
Master. Sang, leave
Master Ip out of this.

32:46.375 --> 32:48.432
It's my idea to come here.

32:48.458 --> 32:50.290
Stop causing so much trouble.

32:50.333 --> 32:53.449
Leave those people
alone, give it up.

32:53.458 --> 32:57.215
I always taught you to
do the right thing.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.990
Look at yourself. Know
what you look like?

33:00.083 --> 33:03.249
Dirty money and a pack of thugs.

33:03.291 --> 33:05.165
Really grand you are.

33:05.208 --> 33:07.124
Think about it. If
you didn't pay them

33:07.166 --> 33:09.049
would they still be there?

33:09.125 --> 33:11.615
When you're around,
they bow and scrape.

33:11.625 --> 33:15.382
Behind your back, they call you
the foreign devil's flunkey.

33:15.416 --> 33:19.574
What? You want to fight me?

33:20.458 --> 33:22.115
So I'm a flunkey.

33:22.208 --> 33:26.932
A flunkey with money is as
good as a king. And you?

33:26.958 --> 33:29.874
A poor teacher, so pure.

33:29.916 --> 33:32.499
You have to repair
umbrellas to eat.

33:32.541 --> 33:34.157
Does that feel good?

33:34.166 --> 33:37.990
You can't eat purity, can you?

33:38.041 --> 33:42.999
Ask yourself which of your
students still remember you?

33:43.041 --> 33:45.657
Which still cares about you?

33:45.750 --> 33:49.907
All of them, they're with me now.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.690
Bastard.

34:06.750 --> 34:09.665
You'd stab me?

34:10.916 --> 34:13.614
You thug. You want to kill me?

34:13.625 --> 34:17.748
Hurt me and you won't escape.

34:18.541 --> 34:21.123
Men, over here.

34:31.416 --> 34:33.549
- Free Ah Sang.
- Don't worry about me.

34:33.625 --> 34:34.790
Attack.

34:34.833 --> 34:38.315
Fight, brothers.

34:39.166 --> 34:40.681
Come on.

34:40.708 --> 34:42.431
Free Ah Sang.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.649
Free Ah Sang.

34:47.708 --> 34:49.123
Police, stop it.

34:49.166 --> 34:51.599
Get back, get back.

34:51.666 --> 34:54.949
Get back.

34:57.041 --> 34:59.207
Go home.

34:59.291 --> 35:02.307
Move and I'll shoot.

35:05.875 --> 35:09.132
You playing with me?

35:09.208 --> 35:11.774
- Get out.
- Say what?

35:11.833 --> 35:14.515
- Now you give the orders?
- Know who owns this patch?

35:14.583 --> 35:17.840
Gonna shoot me? Well.

35:17.916 --> 35:21.899
What'll you tell
your captain then?

35:24.458 --> 35:26.940
Shut up or I'll arrest you.
I'll seal off this whole place.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.590
See what you tell your boss then.

35:29.666 --> 35:33.899
Don't you believe me? Just try me.

35:43.208 --> 35:47.299
What'll you do about the school?

35:48.250 --> 35:51.515
Sang's boss has my
captain in his pocket.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.957
The two foreign devils
are in cahoots.

35:54.958 --> 35:57.540
It's hopeless. The
school is doomed.

35:57.583 --> 36:02.857
Fatty, I trust you as you
aren't like other cops.

36:02.916 --> 36:05.707
But one word from a foreigner
and you drop the case?

36:05.791 --> 36:09.032
It's not that, it's pointless.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.215
So you didn't arrest
the arsonist or

36:11.291 --> 36:14.465
look after the people and kids.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.582
And now my disciples are
doing your job for you.

36:17.666 --> 36:19.207
What else can I do?

36:19.666 --> 36:20.874
What else can I do?

36:21.416 --> 36:23.540
Master Ip, you're a
fighter, not a god.

36:23.583 --> 36:25.590
Too late for that.

36:25.666 --> 36:27.790
You guard the school
day and night.

36:27.833 --> 36:29.682
But for how long?

36:29.750 --> 36:33.749
You know foreign
devils run Hong Kong.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.249
The world's not fair.

36:36.291 --> 36:39.774
But moral standards apply to all.

36:39.833 --> 36:43.115
The ruler isn't always
a superior person.

36:43.166 --> 36:45.732
And the ruled isn't
always inferior.

36:45.750 --> 36:50.390
The world doesn't belong to
the rich or even the powerful

36:50.458 --> 36:52.365
but to those of pure heart.

36:52.416 --> 36:54.549
Have you thought of the children?

36:54.625 --> 36:58.999
All that we do, they're watching.

36:59.041 --> 37:03.099
We need to be good role models.

37:03.458 --> 37:09.732
All that we do, is not for
today but for tomorrow.

37:41.916 --> 37:44.965
"Toss it if you don't want it."

38:17.875 --> 38:21.574
"Please sew on the button."

38:55.500 --> 38:59.032
"Please sew on the button."

39:11.083 --> 39:14.665
Mrs Ip, my initial diagnosis
is to suspect a tumour.

39:14.708 --> 39:17.782
It's not very encouraging.
But we'll learn more

39:17.833 --> 39:20.015
once we have the full report.

39:20.041 --> 39:23.832
Try not to worry too much.

39:43.083 --> 39:44.999
Master Ip.

39:45.041 --> 39:47.415
You work so hard.

39:47.416 --> 39:51.457
Master Ip, we all pitched
in for the soup.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.582
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

39:52.625 --> 39:54.540
You're here night and day.

39:54.583 --> 39:56.082
You need sustenance.

39:56.125 --> 40:00.682
Where are your disciples?
They should have some too.

40:10.833 --> 40:12.332
I had told you the
blue one is better,

40:12.416 --> 40:15.240
but you still buy the red one.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.932
Great, great, another win.

40:17.958 --> 40:20.624
So many fights. What's
the deal? Need money?

40:20.625 --> 40:22.649
It's a living.

40:22.708 --> 40:24.757
I need to eat too.

40:24.791 --> 40:28.490
That time at the school,
you hurt my men.

40:28.541 --> 40:30.724
You owe me.

40:33.083 --> 40:35.999
How much do I owe?

40:36.083 --> 40:38.232
It's not about that.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.490
I admire you.

40:41.500 --> 40:44.940
I wanna be your friend.

40:45.416 --> 40:48.965
Sang, what's this about?

40:49.875 --> 40:52.965
I'm talking about the
kind of friendship

40:53.000 --> 40:55.082
that pushes another
man to the wall.

40:55.125 --> 40:58.432
I'm buying a man's hand here.

40:58.458 --> 41:01.140
You've so many men.

41:01.166 --> 41:02.949
Why do you need me?

41:03.000 --> 41:07.015
Because he knows kung
fu and so do you.

41:07.083 --> 41:09.932
And you fight well.

41:12.708 --> 41:14.790
And if I say no?

41:19.208 --> 41:21.974
Then go elsewhere for a crust.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.874
The blue? Hand it over.

41:24.958 --> 41:28.132
You won? Give it here.

41:28.791 --> 41:30.699
Ah Sang,

41:33.416 --> 41:36.882
that money I want it all.

42:59.583 --> 43:03.140
How many more days of this?

43:06.541 --> 43:08.115
You're up?

43:08.166 --> 43:10.399
I didn't want to wake you.

43:10.458 --> 43:13.082
Just a few more days.

43:13.083 --> 43:15.582
When will you eat at home again?

43:15.625 --> 43:16.924
Tonight.

43:16.958 --> 43:20.324
I'll come back earlier.

43:22.291 --> 43:24.324
Are you okay?

43:26.875 --> 43:28.407
Well...

43:29.791 --> 43:31.682
- Hello.
- Hello. Master Ip?

43:31.708 --> 43:34.724
- Yes, who's this?
- Kowloon Hospital.

43:34.750 --> 43:38.490
- What is it?
- Master Tin is been badly wounded

43:38.500 --> 43:41.065
and he wants to see you.

43:41.125 --> 43:43.490
Okay, I'll be right there.

43:43.541 --> 43:45.632
I made the call.

43:45.666 --> 43:47.632
Thank you.

43:52.791 --> 43:55.499
Let's get to work.

44:00.041 --> 44:01.849
Very good.

44:02.291 --> 44:04.124
Go play.

44:10.083 --> 44:12.690
Luckily it's only a hand injury.

44:17.416 --> 44:18.499
Thank you.

44:18.541 --> 44:22.690
Ah Sang sent him for sure.

44:23.125 --> 44:26.965
As a teacher, I'm a total failure.

44:27.041 --> 44:29.424
- Let's get some.
- Yes, this one.

44:29.458 --> 44:33.290
Kids, I have some cartoon slides.

44:33.333 --> 44:35.815
Want to see them?

44:35.875 --> 44:39.382
It's free. Come on.

44:39.875 --> 44:41.074
Hey.

44:42.916 --> 44:44.415
- Hurry.
- What are you doing?

44:44.458 --> 44:46.040
- Help, help.
- Help me.

44:46.083 --> 44:48.949
Take him.

44:49.125 --> 44:50.999
What're you doing?

44:51.041 --> 44:53.724
- Enjoy.
- Help me.

45:05.125 --> 45:08.640
You've got two hours to get
the principal to the shipyard

45:08.708 --> 45:12.615
or I sell the kids into slavery.

45:13.875 --> 45:15.957
How'd you know I was in hospital?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.057
- You told them to call me.
- No I didn't.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.857
You didn't?

45:29.833 --> 45:31.540
Mrs Ip, where's Master Ip?

45:31.583 --> 45:33.624
What is it?

45:34.541 --> 45:37.524
Tell me what happened?

45:37.833 --> 45:40.315
- Master Ip.
- What is it, Miss Wong?

45:40.375 --> 45:43.649
A man abducted Ching,
Fong and other kids.

45:43.650 --> 45:44.740
What?

45:44.750 --> 45:47.040
If the principal
doesn't go to see him,

45:47.083 --> 45:51.365
he'll sell the
children into slavery.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.165
Hurry, find the principal.

45:54.208 --> 45:56.815
Inform Sergeant Po.

46:29.625 --> 46:31.240
Great.

46:32.083 --> 46:36.124
I want the principal
and you bring a pole.

46:37.166 --> 46:38.882
Just great.

46:39.250 --> 46:41.074
And the principal?

46:41.125 --> 46:42.990
On his way.

46:43.166 --> 46:45.140
First let the kids go.

46:45.166 --> 46:46.257
Okay?

46:46.291 --> 46:50.290
- Dad, Dad.
- Shut up.

46:50.500 --> 46:53.007
Son, don't be afraid.

46:53.083 --> 46:54.449
I'm here.

46:54.458 --> 46:56.440
So, this is your son?

46:56.458 --> 47:00.107
Lucky. I was hoping to get him.

47:00.166 --> 47:02.832
Let him out.

47:04.708 --> 47:07.282
Stand straight.

47:07.333 --> 47:09.632
Calm down,

47:09.958 --> 47:12.415
kid, come here.

47:12.750 --> 47:16.715
Ah Sang, the kids aren't to blame.

47:16.791 --> 47:18.690
Don't mess with them, okay?

47:18.708 --> 47:21.065
How am I messing with them?

47:21.083 --> 47:24.424
I'm giving him apple.

47:25.333 --> 47:27.674
Don't be afraid, have some apple.

47:27.708 --> 47:31.307
Just tell Dad to
put down the pole.

47:31.375 --> 47:33.340
Then we can talk.

47:33.416 --> 47:34.874
Ching, don't be afraid.

47:34.916 --> 47:38.074
Put down the pole.

47:41.625 --> 47:45.582
Act like you mean
it. On your knees.

47:49.250 --> 47:51.882
Kowtow.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.207
Master Ip?

48:03.291 --> 48:06.524
Hey, what're you doing here?

48:06.541 --> 48:08.132
There's no fight today.

48:08.208 --> 48:09.649
You took my son.

48:09.666 --> 48:11.799
Master. Master.

48:11.916 --> 48:13.657
Help me.

48:13.750 --> 48:15.299
Ah Fong.

48:15.333 --> 48:16.999
So he's your boy.

48:17.041 --> 48:21.682
Sorry. He's one of
ours. Let him go.

48:22.375 --> 48:24.157
Lucky it was me who took him.

48:24.250 --> 48:27.974
Anything could've happened.

48:38.166 --> 48:41.374
Leave it alone. Go.

48:43.166 --> 48:46.682
Ip Man, you're a
good fighter, yes?

48:46.750 --> 48:48.582
Can you take on 10 men?

48:48.625 --> 48:51.874
Don't say I never
gave you a chance.

48:51.958 --> 48:54.440
One against 10...

48:54.458 --> 48:56.090
or say 11.

48:56.166 --> 49:02.515
With every punch you land,
I'll give him a piece to eat.

49:51.708 --> 49:56.132
Master, they still
have my friends.

50:38.625 --> 50:40.040
Why are you back?

50:40.041 --> 50:43.649
To pick the kids up from school.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.574
Bastard.

51:49.208 --> 51:50.940
Move.

51:55.541 --> 51:57.457
Over here.

52:12.583 --> 52:14.399
Get him.

52:22.791 --> 52:27.282
- Another step and I'll kill him.
- Dad.

52:31.375 --> 52:33.274
Bite him.

52:37.500 --> 52:39.215
What the...?

52:42.916 --> 52:44.632
Go.

52:56.500 --> 52:59.765
Grab the kid, hurry.

53:19.541 --> 53:22.257
Over there, quick.

53:27.208 --> 53:28.307
Dad.

53:28.333 --> 53:30.357
Dad. Dad.

53:46.291 --> 53:47.874
David, don't just stand there.

53:47.916 --> 53:50.607
Grab that kid.

54:09.041 --> 54:10.815
Dad.

54:21.625 --> 54:24.640
Kneel. Don't move.

54:25.041 --> 54:27.574
Kneel.

54:29.791 --> 54:32.357
Don't move. Kneel.

54:32.416 --> 54:34.965
- Hear me?
- I'm not with them.

54:44.208 --> 54:47.782
Don't move. No one move.

54:48.625 --> 54:50.224
Police. Don't move.

54:50.250 --> 54:52.490
No one move.

54:52.583 --> 54:54.957
Go in and take photos.

54:54.958 --> 54:57.265
Don't move.

54:57.291 --> 55:00.582
All those guys over there.

55:00.583 --> 55:04.640
They'll make great news photos.
Great headline material.

55:04.666 --> 55:07.224
Get 'em all.

55:09.500 --> 55:12.665
I said don't move.

55:27.708 --> 55:29.932
Mama.

55:30.291 --> 55:32.232
Ah Ching.

55:47.208 --> 55:50.482
There was trouble at the school.

55:51.750 --> 55:54.924
They abducted Ah Ching.

55:56.333 --> 55:59.549
I'm so sorry, Wing-Sing.

56:02.166 --> 56:04.240
It's my fault.

56:05.958 --> 56:08.649
I was wrong.

56:12.250 --> 56:14.565
It's my fault.

56:15.208 --> 56:19.557
It won't happen again, okay?

56:31.958 --> 56:33.599
Go wash your face.

56:33.666 --> 56:35.774
Good kid.

57:01.208 --> 57:04.549
It's all my fault.

57:04.875 --> 57:06.057
Don't cry.

57:06.083 --> 57:10.099
Darling, I'm so afraid.

57:11.750 --> 57:14.299
It's all right now.

57:14.583 --> 57:17.865
But I might not be.

57:24.916 --> 57:27.182
What do you mean?

57:34.041 --> 57:36.549
The doctor said...

57:37.166 --> 57:39.690
I probably...

57:39.750 --> 57:42.715
have cancer.

57:56.458 --> 57:59.557
The black spots
indicate cancer cells.

57:59.583 --> 58:00.832
These are tumours.

58:00.875 --> 58:07.249
The cancer has spread too widely
for us to be able to operate.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.765
Is it curable?

58:20.083 --> 58:24.807
Normally, we'd prescribe
medicines but at this stage,

58:24.833 --> 58:29.215
they're unlikely to
get it under control.

58:30.333 --> 58:34.524
Doctor, how much time do I have?

58:34.583 --> 58:37.274
Maybe 6 months.

59:18.875 --> 59:22.290
I'll get you more rice.

59:29.666 --> 59:31.465
Just half.

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:37.857
Don't worry, you're safe. The
police are on your side.

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:42.165
Every day there's a new
story in the paper.

01:00:42.166 --> 01:00:46.832
Abducted children, people being
thrown from their homes.

01:00:46.916 --> 01:00:48.165
My boss is unhappy.

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.499
And when my boss is
unhappy, I'm unhappy.

01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:55.540
So for the time being all this
nefarious vice and corruption

01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:57.999
that you so love to
engage yourself in

01:00:58.083 --> 01:01:00.707
you'll have to take a
hiatus. Otherwise...

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:09.474
- Whatever you say.
- Yes.

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:12.874
Well, Frankie, these chats
are always a pleasure.

01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:15.049
Cheerio.

01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:23.832
Hey, Boss.

01:01:23.833 --> 01:01:25.332
This Thai guy is incredible.

01:01:25.416 --> 01:01:27.715
Elbows, knees, fists, all
great. Really fierce.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.690
- Put it up.
- I know it's my mistake, Boss.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:33.840
I just meant to give the principal
a scare not to create such a mess.

01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:38.107
Ip Man, it's all his
fault. I'm sorry.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:45.224
I don't ever want to
see your face again.

01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:47.090
Fuck off.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.824
Ip Man.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.815
Finish him off.

01:05:12.791 --> 01:05:14.665
Get out.

01:05:56.708 --> 01:05:58.899
Want any tea?

01:05:58.958 --> 01:06:01.449
Listen, things have quieted down.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:04.199
I'm not expecting more trouble.

01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:09.857
But the foreign devils
can't be trusted.

01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:14.590
Ah Sang's boss has it out
for you. Be careful.

01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:33.290
So smart.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.640
Mum, look.

You want me, I'm here.

01:07:07.208 --> 01:07:09.907
What do you want?

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:19.965
So, you're Ip Man?

01:07:20.041 --> 01:07:22.982
You're the best fighter in China.

01:07:23.041 --> 01:07:25.432
Interesting.

01:07:27.708 --> 01:07:29.999
Okay, let's deal.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.790
It seems to me that your Wing
Chun fists is the fastest.

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:38.290
So fast you're invincible.

01:07:38.666 --> 01:07:42.182
Let's see whose fists
are fastest. Yours?

01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:43.990
Or mine?

01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:47.090
3 minutes.

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:53.290
If you last by then,
I'll let you be.

01:11:38.208 --> 01:11:40.290
Hey, how ya doing?

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:43.224
I want my balloon back.

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:45.499
Let it go, don't worry about it.

01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:47.724
We'll get a new one, okay?

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:50.740
A new balloon.

01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:06.199
Madame, here's my rent.

01:12:06.291 --> 01:12:08.874
I always said you'd come good.

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:12.332
Best of luck. You'll
be raking it in.

01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:16.290
Great. I can practise
Wing Chun here.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:19.890
- Master, respect.
- Respect.

01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:22.474
Sir, you teach Wing Chun?

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.624
You must know Ip Man, yes?

01:12:24.666 --> 01:12:28.674
Look, today's newspaper,
he's in the news.

01:12:28.708 --> 01:12:31.565
He's so impressive.

01:12:31.583 --> 01:12:33.724
I bet you two are great friends.

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.049
Introduce me sometime.

01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:38.740
Here's the key. I leave you.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:41.790
Don't forget to introduce me.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.299
Did you write this?

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:55.774

My name is Cheung Tin-Chi.

01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:03.907
I'm also a Wing Chun fighter.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.982
Can you write about me too?

01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:13.524
I've seen Ip Man's kung fu.
It's not authentic Wing Chun.

01:13:13.708 --> 01:13:15.470
I'll challenge him
to a public match.

01:13:15.471 --> 01:13:16.615
All the kung fu schools

01:13:16.666 --> 01:13:18.949
respect Ip Man's Wing Chun.

Sure, I'll write something.

01:13:21.166 --> 01:13:26.165
But we'll see if the kung fu world
will think you're qualified

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:29.499
to publicly challenge Ip Man?

01:13:43.041 --> 01:13:45.457
Have a seat, Master.

01:13:46.208 --> 01:13:48.974
Got your camera?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.399
Nice tea today.

01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:58.790

A friendly match?

Mr Wong, thanks for your support.

guts and ambition.

Master Cheung,

01:15:46.291 --> 01:15:50.207
you're fighting everyone and
take along photographers.

01:15:50.208 --> 01:15:53.699
You don't worry people will talk?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I know lots of people think I'm
a show-off who acts superior.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:07.807
But in kung fu, you need
to establish who's tops.

01:16:07.833 --> 01:16:09.724
And I want to tell people this:

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:15.365
Ip Man, can't represent Wing Chun.

01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:20.115
Gentlemen, I hereby announce:

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:23.274

"WHOSE IS THE TRUE WING CHUN?"

01:16:52.416 --> 01:16:55.882
Darling, it's so ridiculous.

01:16:56.666 --> 01:16:59.540
It's like the joke about Ah Mo.

01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:02.124
He's dining with friends. He says:

01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:05.399
We're all henpecked. Want proof?

01:17:05.416 --> 01:17:09.165
If your wife is the
boss, sit over there.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.915
All the men, heads low, went over.

01:17:10.958 --> 01:17:13.265
Only Mo stayed where he was.

01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:14.374
They said wow.

01:17:14.458 --> 01:17:17.474
Mo, you're The Man.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.390
Know what Mo said? He said:
well, my wife told me:

01:17:20.416 --> 01:17:22.740
"Don't sit in crowded places."

01:17:22.833 --> 01:17:25.499
Funny, right?

01:17:25.625 --> 01:17:27.715
Are you scared of your wife?

01:17:27.791 --> 01:17:30.074
Sometimes.

01:17:46.291 --> 01:17:48.340
Next.

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:53.049
Are you Cheung Wing-Sing?

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:59.765
Why'd God make women
pretty but dumb?

01:17:59.791 --> 01:18:03.540
They're pretty so
men will like them.

01:18:03.625 --> 01:18:09.640
They're dumb so
they will like men.

01:18:15.833 --> 01:18:17.290
Look, someone is
challenging Ip Man.

01:18:17.333 --> 01:18:19.324
- When?
- Next month, on the 15th.

01:18:19.416 --> 01:18:21.724
Harder.

01:18:21.791 --> 01:18:25.007
Relax the shoulders, punch fast.

01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:31.149
This way, Master Cheung.

01:18:31.166 --> 01:18:32.224
I want to sit there.

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:34.357
"Master Ip."

01:18:44.833 --> 01:18:46.740
Excuse me.

01:18:49.708 --> 01:18:52.907
Master Ip, what are
you doing here?

01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:55.874
I'm looking for Mr Chan.

01:18:55.916 --> 01:18:57.807
You want to learn dancing?

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.890
I dance better than him.

01:18:59.916 --> 01:19:01.040
I'll teach you.

01:19:01.083 --> 01:19:04.290
And you can teach me kung fu.

01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:06.890
Sure. Now?

01:19:06.916 --> 01:19:08.640
Okay.

01:19:10.416 --> 01:19:13.657
When will you accept
me as a disciple?

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.707
You got it all wrong.

01:19:15.708 --> 01:19:18.149
I didn't say I would
not accept you.

01:19:18.166 --> 01:19:22.624
I didn't open the
door so you'd leave.

01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:32.324
Thank you. Welcome.

01:19:32.333 --> 01:19:35.624
Wing Chun vs. Wing Chun
who's the real deal?

01:19:35.708 --> 01:19:39.307
It's a historic day for Wing Chun.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:42.574
It will be like a
battle of dragons.

01:19:42.625 --> 01:19:45.665
Yes. Is Ip Man the
greater fighter?

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:48.724
Or is Cheung Tin-Chi
fiercer still?

01:19:48.791 --> 01:19:51.957
Who represents the true Wing Chun?

01:19:52.041 --> 01:19:55.215
Today at 3:00 p.m. the
contest will begin.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.974
We wait with bated breath.

01:19:57.016 --> 01:19:58.040
Sergeant Po, Sergeant Po.

01:19:58.042 --> 01:19:59.108
- Brother.
- Master Tin.

01:19:59.183 --> 01:20:01.299
- Ah-Lik, where's Master Ip?
- No idea.

01:20:01.375 --> 01:20:04.207
What's the problem?
Maybe he's lost.

01:20:04.291 --> 01:20:08.790
Relax, Ip Man won't let us down.

01:20:08.791 --> 01:20:10.690
I'm here.

01:20:30.916 --> 01:20:35.024
It's 3:00 p.m. Why
isn't Ip Man here?

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:38.349
It's time.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:39.415
It's time.

01:20:39.458 --> 01:20:41.715
Look, it's 3.

01:20:53.583 --> 01:20:56.107
Where's your master?

01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:04.465
Gentlemen, the match was
scheduled for 3:00 p.m.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:08.457
Since Ip Man has failed to
show up I hereby announce

01:21:08.541 --> 01:21:15.715
the victor and true spirit of
Wing Chun, Cheung Tin-Chi.

01:21:16.416 --> 01:21:19.332
Dad. Dad. We won.

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:22.490
Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

01:21:22.541 --> 01:21:26.349
And this makes you a grandmaster?

01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:29.124
Master Cheung, what
do you have to say

01:21:29.208 --> 01:21:32.340
about Ip Man's no-show today?

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:38.532
To mess with classic Wing Chun

01:21:38.541 --> 01:21:43.240
is to lose the
forefathers' vision.

01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:47.649
It's wrong both now and
in future as well.

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:53.757
Our forefathers don't need
worry about the form's future.

01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:56.749
I believe Master Ip
understands this.

01:21:56.833 --> 01:21:59.932
So he chose to forfeit the fight.

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:03.457
This is also an act
of great merit.

01:22:03.708 --> 01:22:06.065
From today,

01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:08.849
I, Cheung Tin-Chi,

01:22:08.916 --> 01:22:14.807
will lead the true Wing
Chun to a glorious future.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.082
- Bravo.
- True Wing Chun.

01:22:17.125 --> 01:22:19.474
What'd you say?

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.165
You've no right to claim that.

01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:24.882
You aren't qualified
to fight my master.

01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:33.357
- Settle down, stop.
- Stop.

01:22:54.166 --> 01:22:56.715
Wing-Sing. Wing-Sing.

01:22:58.583 --> 01:23:02.582
Please, someone call an ambulance.

01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:14.399
Mr Ip, her condition is worsening.

01:23:14.416 --> 01:23:18.632
She needs to stay in
hospital for a bit.

01:23:43.458 --> 01:23:46.674
Well? Feeling any better?

01:23:48.833 --> 01:23:51.915
When can we go home?

01:23:52.416 --> 01:23:57.857
The doctor said it's better
for you to stay here.

01:24:02.375 --> 01:24:04.690
You need rest.

01:24:45.291 --> 01:24:48.415
85... no, you're right.

01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:05.465
Give the letter to Cheung Fong.
Tell him to give it to his dad.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.640
Nurse, nurse.

01:25:10.875 --> 01:25:12.915
What is it, madam?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.415
Are you in pain?

01:25:14.458 --> 01:25:17.824
Don't worry, I'll get the doctor.

01:25:26.833 --> 01:25:30.532
Have some bullfrog soup.

01:25:31.333 --> 01:25:34.549
It's good for you.

01:25:53.541 --> 01:25:55.540
Darling,

01:25:56.625 --> 01:26:00.940
I want a photograph with you.

01:27:11.458 --> 01:27:13.790
You spend every day with me.

01:27:13.833 --> 01:27:17.157
It makes me so happy.

01:27:18.125 --> 01:27:21.157
But I could be happier.

01:27:24.083 --> 01:27:26.357
People say:

01:27:27.166 --> 01:27:32.499
Life belongs to you
and it doesn't.

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:38.007
I didn't get it before.

01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:43.174
But now, I'm beginning to.

01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:48.407
You belong to yourself.

01:27:48.666 --> 01:27:51.640
And to this family.

01:27:52.375 --> 01:27:55.390
But to this place as well.

01:27:56.708 --> 01:28:00.790
There are things you should do.

01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:05.507
I don't want you to have regrets.

01:28:13.958 --> 01:28:18.090
I only regret not
being better to you.

01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:23.682
But I think you've
been great to me.

01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:29.149
If it wasn't for my sickness,

01:28:29.208 --> 01:28:33.349
would you have taken
the challenge?

01:28:49.625 --> 01:28:51.132
Yes.

01:28:53.916 --> 01:28:58.307
That's the Ip Man I love.

01:28:59.791 --> 01:29:06.032
I've taken the liberty of
setting a date with him.

01:29:15.208 --> 01:29:19.624
I haven't heard you
practise in ages.

01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:23.949
Will you let me hear
that sound again?

01:32:29.958 --> 01:32:33.565
Wing Chun, Cheung Tin-Chi.

01:32:36.333 --> 01:32:39.782
Wing Chun, Ip Man.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.649
- Ip Ching, the back way.
- Okay.

01:39:31.166 --> 01:39:34.557
I recognise that I'm defeated.

01:39:39.083 --> 01:39:42.015
There's nothing more important

01:39:43.041 --> 01:39:46.807
than the love of
those by your side.

01:40:50.958 --> 01:40:55.499
"Ip Man's wife, Cheung Wing-Sing"

01:40:55.541 --> 01:40:59.824
"passed away in 1960 from cancer."

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:34.884
"Ip Man taught Ip Ching Wing Chun.
Martial arts guided his life."

01:41:34.916 --> 01:41:36.165
"Ip Man became a Grandmaster."

01:41:36.208 --> 01:41:38.042
"Wing Chun has flourished,
generation after generation,"

01:41:38.043 --> 01:41:40.984
"spreading across the world."
