00:49.550 --> 00:52.720
Hi, you don't happen to have the...

00:55.014 --> 00:56.314
<i>The cross corms.</i>

00:58.601 --> 01:00.651
I'm sorry, what?

01:00.811 --> 01:02.271
<i>The cross corms.</i>

01:05.942 --> 01:07.652
Which one are you talking about?

01:07.818 --> 01:09.028
Issue two.

01:10.363 --> 01:11.493
Right.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.279
Do you have what it takes
to get that comic?

01:15.451 --> 01:16.491
Yeah.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.405
Here.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.121
Where did you get this?

01:22.500 --> 01:24.460
My great-grandfather passed it down.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.842
Oh, I see. Wait right there.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.804
Did she just say, "cross"?

01:34.887 --> 01:36.507
Here you are, but...

01:36.931 --> 01:38.601
Be very careful with it.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.891
This is a one of a kind.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.729
The only issue available.

01:43.896 --> 01:47.856
- Guard it with your life.
- Okay.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.435
- Yeah, I will. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.406
<i>The world has been at war
since its creation.</i>

01:53.572 --> 01:56.622
<i>So many lives lost in vain.</i>

01:56.784 --> 01:58.124
<i>Deaths of warriors...</i>

01:58.703 --> 02:00.753
Sailors...

02:02.081 --> 02:04.131
<i>soldiers...</i>

02:04.917 --> 02:06.957
<i>and the innocent.</i>

02:09.922 --> 02:11.762
The wrong place at the wrong time.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.304
<i>That's where we come in.</i>

02:13.467 --> 02:15.257
<i>The gods chose warrior families...</i>

02:15.428 --> 02:18.178
to <i>protect mankind
from the darkest of enemies.</i>

02:18.347 --> 02:22.347
<i>They forged amulets from celestial alloys
and armed each family.</i>

02:22.518 --> 02:26.858
<i>The most powerful amulet
is the cross of the isles.</i>

02:30.318 --> 02:32.398
<i>Armed with the powers of the cross...</i>

02:32.570 --> 02:34.610
<i>Callan and his team
of weapons experts...</i>

02:34.780 --> 02:37.370
<i>fight crime in Los Angeles.</i>

02:42.204 --> 02:45.254
<i>But now, an enemy has returned.</i>

02:45.416 --> 02:48.456
<i>And a new enemy
has joined him on his quest.</i>

02:48.627 --> 02:49.997
<i>To save the world...</i>

02:50.171 --> 02:54.011
<i>Callan and his team
must fight their biggest battle yet.</i>

02:54.175 --> 02:56.255
- "It's early morning in the high desert."
- What...?

02:57.053 --> 02:59.683
You... you have to add charisma.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.767
This is an action comic book.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.814
Let me show you how it's done.

03:05.311 --> 03:07.151
"It's early morning in the high desert.

03:07.855 --> 03:12.025
The sun rises and we see beautiful
snowcapped mountains in the distance.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.193
A white SUV...

03:13.402 --> 03:16.322
<i>travels down the long desert roads."</i>

04:43.576 --> 04:44.656
Let's go, pizzle-fire.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.120
Hey, hey-

04:47.663 --> 04:48.713
crocodile hunter.

04:49.165 --> 04:50.205
It's blackfire.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.165
<i>Backfire.</i>

04:52.751 --> 04:55.211
Get out my way.
Got in some bullstick. You know...

04:55.379 --> 04:57.509
Rosa parks fought for this, she fought.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.803
Got me in the back like some damn cat.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.600
Brother war. I want you
and old pizzle-fire...

05:04.763 --> 05:06.563
to work your way up the right side.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.734
Shark, you and Lucia take the middle.

05:08.893 --> 05:12.903
Saint, ranger and I, we're gonna work all
the way down the left and forward.

05:13.272 --> 05:17.612
Remember, our intel has the weapons
cache in one of those RV's.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.736
A white one
with a brown stripe on the side.

05:22.448 --> 05:23.488
You know...

05:24.200 --> 05:25.700
gives me that creepy feeling.

05:25.868 --> 05:29.958
That tip off is starting to feel
just a little too convenient.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.674
Well, the quicker
we can find those guns...

05:33.000 --> 05:34.960
- the quicker we get out of here.
- Good.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.376
Because I'm hungry.

05:36.921 --> 05:38.461
- Hungry? You just had...
- Yeah.

05:38.631 --> 05:41.091
Flapjacks, bacon, eggs, grits...

05:41.258 --> 05:44.178
toast, cereal, milk,
orange juice, cheese...

05:44.345 --> 05:46.135
And I'm exhausted.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.600
You know, there's nothing more tiresome
than eating and drinking.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.267
If it wasn't so daggone good.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.805
- And necessary, of course.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Voltaire.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.481
- Okay.
- Let's find those guns.

05:57.650 --> 05:58.940
We can find the guns.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.149
Wait.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.611
What?

06:06.700 --> 06:07.740
What? What?

06:07.910 --> 06:09.950
You forgot pork chops.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.495
Oh, man, that was almost insulting.

06:15.668 --> 06:19.048
You gonna forget my pork chops.
You name everything but the pork chops?

06:19.213 --> 06:21.723
That was the main course.
What you talking about, man?

06:26.011 --> 06:28.931
Something about this place
creeps me out.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.235
Yeah, come on in, boys.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.608
Come on in.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.804
My mama used to make pork chops,
make these nice pork chops.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.509
She'd fry it up, put gravy on it,
had a little fat gristle.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.020
Fat is my favorite.
I used to save it for the end.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.142
Eat the meat at the beginning
and save fat, know what I mean?

07:15.311 --> 07:17.351
- Right.
- Wait, wait.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.610
You forgot dessert.

07:21.317 --> 07:22.567
Cheesecake.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.651
Cheesecake and strawberry.
You know, this is crazy, man.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.531
I'm getting so hungry...

07:27.698 --> 07:30.138
I think I wanna kill some bad guys
and go to Denny's right now.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.159
This is great.

07:35.331 --> 07:36.371
Clear.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.132
This one?

07:38.417 --> 07:40.087
Yeah.
Looks like that's the one.

07:57.853 --> 07:58.943
No weapons.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.819
Note.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.754
Contact, run.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.340
- Party's going. Let's get in it.
- Let's do it, let's do it.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.361
Good work, 12 o'clock.

08:46.944 --> 08:47.994
Three o'clock.

08:49.822 --> 08:51.072
Let's waste these bastards.

09:05.671 --> 09:06.711
Fall back, behind you.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.107
Three o'clock.

09:26.442 --> 09:28.032
Go, go. I got you covered.

09:29.153 --> 09:30.203
Let's go.

09:35.659 --> 09:36.869
Let's go, let's go.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.211
Get behind me.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.762
Son of a bitch. They're everywhere.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.058
Stay down.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.619
War, come on.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.159
- Come on, blackfire, get back here.
- Move! Move!

10:30.964 --> 10:32.014
Stay down.

10:38.889 --> 10:39.929
- Come on.
- Get down.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.595
All right, here we go.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.981
- One more.
- You're gonna get shot in the head.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.106
Watch your back.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.359
Stay down!

11:41.994 --> 11:43.254
You find anything?

11:43.829 --> 11:45.579
- Not even one gun.
- Nothing.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.332
You bring my sandwich?

11:48.834 --> 11:49.884
It's all right.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.297
Let's go.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.625
Let's get out of here.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.046
What's wrong with you, man?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.631
I'm just saying. No one else is hungry?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.970
- I'm hungry.
- Fighting crime gets me excited.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.026
Yeah, that was me. That was me.

12:13.734 --> 12:14.784
That was me.

12:15.611 --> 12:16.651
Oh, man.

12:22.576 --> 12:23.736
This was not a set-up.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.452
This was a death sentence.

12:25.621 --> 12:26.961
- But not just us.
- No.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.582
Whoever did this
didn't care about their own crew.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.841
No loyalty.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.844
I'll meet you guys at the warehouse.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.011
I'm gonna go get intel.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.591
You're gonna talk to snitch?

12:40.969 --> 12:42.929
He sold me bad info
about a month ago.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.345
Bad info?

12:45.349 --> 12:46.979
Getting girls' numbers isn't intel.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.453
When was the last time
you got a number?

12:48.477 --> 12:50.267
- Hey.
- Time's ticking guys.

12:50.854 --> 12:51.904
- Let's go.
- Let's roll.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.686
You're so cool, man.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.070
- You're so... you're so cool.
- Get in the back.

12:59.821 --> 13:00.861
I should ride with him.

13:02.074 --> 13:03.204
You got it all mixed up.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.542
Damn.

13:34.398 --> 13:35.398
You wanna know that...

13:35.565 --> 13:38.185
it's gonna cost extra.
That'll be everything you need.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.780
Does this include the refund
from last time?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.827
Gentlemen,
this concludes our business for today.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.500
Where'd you get the intel?

13:54.626 --> 13:55.916
The usual suspects.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.467
Paul tells Ringo, Ringo tells George,
George tells me.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.932
- I would have gotten it from John but...
- George is dead.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.555
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.311
We got hit.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.481
- A set-up?
- Hard.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.272
Comes with the territory, my friend.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.574
Look, I'm not blaming you.

14:19.401 --> 14:22.111
If I were, you wouldn't be standing, okay?

14:26.408 --> 14:27.698
But I do wanna know...

14:28.452 --> 14:30.202
where you got the tip from.

14:31.246 --> 14:34.876
Look, if I go around
ratting out all of my informants...

14:35.042 --> 14:36.602
no one's gonna do business
with me...

14:36.668 --> 14:39.758
then where will you get intel from
when you need it?

14:42.507 --> 14:43.927
Who's the boss?

14:48.013 --> 14:49.813
You know I can't do that, Callan.

14:50.599 --> 14:51.729
Look

14:52.642 --> 14:54.692
I don't bribe.

14:55.020 --> 14:58.360
I always pay for the information I get.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.481
But...

15:00.734 --> 15:04.494
- if I have to ask you one more time...
- Wait a second.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.869
Boss's name is Muerte.
That's the word on the street.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.622
Scary guy.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.328
like Keyser Soze.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.419
A real diablo.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.794
That's all I know, man.

15:21.505 --> 15:22.875
Thanks.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.718
No... no problem.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.934
Better get back to my business.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.055
Can't be seen talking to the likes of you.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.282
Come for the fiber, stay for the taste.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.785
- No, I'm all right.
- All right. All right.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.886
You get some intel?

16:09.719 --> 16:11.299
New boss.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.311
He already has a beef with us.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.683
That's impressive, guys.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.475
Why don't we find him first
and beat him to the punch?

16:17.811 --> 16:19.811
I heard this guy's bad.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.609
Real bad.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.279
Well, does this freak have a name?

16:26.528 --> 16:27.818
Muerte.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.411
Muerte, really?

16:31.575 --> 16:36.445
I mean, that's typical overconfident male.
I... I see it all the time.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.132
My guess his mommy didn't play
with him enough as a kid.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.960
Fan-freaking-tastic.

16:43.295 --> 16:45.625
Dude named Spanish death.

16:45.797 --> 16:49.797
Did the snitch give us a location,
or do we have to go looking in hell?

16:49.968 --> 16:51.678
I don't know.

16:51.970 --> 16:56.430
I mean, do what you do.
Get on the computer, your cell phone.

16:56.975 --> 17:00.185
Fine. I'll do what I do.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.819
He doesn't seem like the kind of guy we'll
be able to tie up till Nitti gets him.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.742
No, it sounds like the type of guy
that we need to put down.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.823
- Permanently.
- I like the way she thinks.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.751
Seems like everybody's on edge.

17:21.583 --> 17:27.262
I recommend we finish up here
and go home and get some shut-eye.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.423
No complaints.

17:29.591 --> 17:30.591
Yeah, I'm beat.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.392
Nuke.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.017
- Hold down the fort.
- I always do.

17:42.771 --> 17:46.321
I strive to take my work home,
so it's easy to make work my home.

17:46.483 --> 17:49.493
Oh, speaking of work.
Nuke, did you...

17:49.653 --> 17:52.913
finish those spherical detonators?

17:53.365 --> 17:54.815
Your exploding balls?

17:55.367 --> 17:57.117
Exploding balls. Yes.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.365
If that's what you call them.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.287
Everyone calls them that except for me.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.879
Hey, Callan?

18:05.126 --> 18:07.496
Don't go trying to save the world
by yourself, okay?

18:07.671 --> 18:10.551
- Okay.
- And if you see something...

18:10.715 --> 18:11.715
call us.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.469
All right, boys and girls.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.889
Who the hell is this guy anyway?

19:02.058 --> 19:03.518
Doesn't he know we run L.A.?

19:05.353 --> 19:08.573
- No one tells us what to do in our town.
- When he shows up...

19:11.609 --> 19:12.899
<i>I</i> say we kill him.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.823
Show him who's boss.

19:16.990 --> 19:20.830
Send a message to the next guy who
thinks he can call a mandatory meeting.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.662
Dangerous. I think it's hot.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.294
I'd like to have a long night with him.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.756
Ladies, lowlifes, and soon to be dead...

19:38.595 --> 19:40.175
Brother...

19:40.764 --> 19:42.354
Who you calling a lowlife?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.640
Who gave you that name,
Muerte, anyway?

19:46.436 --> 19:49.106
Your dishrag mother
didn't love you enough?

19:49.981 --> 19:53.111
Muerte's Spanish for "death," you idiot.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.863
Oh, I see.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.450
I'm supposed to be afraid of you.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.619
You're a scary guy?

20:04.204 --> 20:06.294
You want me to kill him, boss?

20:13.713 --> 20:17.343
You're... you're new.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.933
I don't know you.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.676
- What name do you go by?
- Me?

20:22.847 --> 20:23.967
I go by grime.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.443
Grime.

20:27.769 --> 20:31.149
That's like that dirty little grease spot
in the oven.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.328
Anyone else?

20:54.212 --> 20:56.342
- Poor bastard.
- I like your style.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.683
Good.

20:59.843 --> 21:03.603
Now that we have an understanding,
here's what I want.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.639
I want anyone that stands in our way...

21:07.809 --> 21:09.269
."Dead.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.767
Now, is that clear enough?

21:16.985 --> 21:19.235
Nod if you understand.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.238
Now...

21:23.408 --> 21:26.618
to own a city, you have to be
the strongest in a city...

21:26.786 --> 21:29.866
and to be the strongest in a city...

21:30.039 --> 21:32.169
you have to kill the strongest
in the city.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.089
- Agreed?
- Hundred percent.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.923
Absolutely.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.093
Yeah, what about Callan?

21:39.591 --> 21:40.881
Let Callan live.

21:41.801 --> 21:45.391
But the cross team, they have to die.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.925
And anyone that's in bed with them...

21:48.099 --> 21:49.429
is dead.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.849
There's a lot of cash to be acquired.

21:53.062 --> 21:56.232
And we don't want anybody
getting in our way.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.819
Lots of people
want the cross team dead.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.410
What's so special about this guy?

22:02.655 --> 22:05.735
I don't know. I don't care.
Some whacked-out scientist.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.289
What's with all the questions?

22:07.452 --> 22:09.332
Well, see, well...

22:09.496 --> 22:11.536
We've all been down that road before...

22:11.706 --> 22:15.586
and it didn't really work out because,
see, 70 percent of my crew got whacked.

22:15.877 --> 22:17.457
The rest moved out of town.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.545
I had to build a whole new gang.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.381
Yeah.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.719
This time it's gonna be different.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.635
I lost a crew this morning.

22:26.137 --> 22:30.557
But the four of you,
with your gangs together...

22:30.725 --> 22:33.015
it'll all be over by morning.

22:33.353 --> 22:37.233
We kill the cross team,
our investor will take care of Callan.

22:37.482 --> 22:38.782
With all due respect...

22:39.901 --> 22:41.951
that still won't be good enough.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.950
I have a couple of aces up my sleeve.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.044
Kade, Jax.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.419
Just point at the target.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.252
And we kill the target.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.671
I like it.

23:02.382 --> 23:06.142
Now with all of you
and your teams united...

23:06.970 --> 23:08.390
this will be doable.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.268
Oh, and one more thing.

23:10.431 --> 23:13.521
I get 60 percent of the take
from now on.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.558
Man.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.611
Now go kill them.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.904
And don't come back till it's done.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.446
Let's go, girls.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.243
Hey, slick.

23:27.532 --> 23:30.032
Bring me some Trejo's tacos.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.791
Muerte is a really bad guy.

23:33.246 --> 23:36.706
Yeah. He's the worst of the worst.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.906
Callan, where you been?

24:13.411 --> 24:14.791
Working nights.

24:15.413 --> 24:18.083
- Still stocking?
- You know me.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.499
I love groceries.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.956
I ordered your fave when you came in.
A nice tall glass of agua.

24:25.715 --> 24:26.965
Thank you.

24:28.718 --> 24:30.468
Old flame?

24:32.472 --> 24:33.932
Wildfire.

24:34.849 --> 24:37.439
- Anything else would be a crime.
- Hey, Callan.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.608
April.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.272
You staying out of trouble?

24:42.899 --> 24:44.529
- Trying.
- Yeah?

25:40.456 --> 25:43.626
Hey, pretty lady. What you drinking?

25:45.294 --> 25:47.384
I said, what you drinking?

25:47.547 --> 25:48.627
Hey-

25:48.798 --> 25:50.798
my boy's talking to you.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.652
- You're still using those moves?
- I use what works.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.873
Yeah, as long as it's fighting
and not a relationship.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.246
- I had to leave, okay?
- You are so not gonna blame me for that.

26:33.968 --> 26:36.758
<i>- I'll</i> have what they're having.
- Make that a double.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.443
Well, that ought to do it.

26:45.146 --> 26:46.186
Should we go?

26:46.355 --> 26:48.855
Yeah, the rest
should be showing up soon.

26:51.068 --> 26:54.068
I'll clean it up.
You lovebirds get out of here.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.620
Does everybody know?

27:00.244 --> 27:02.754
So you wanna meet at our spot?

27:02.914 --> 27:05.634
Roger that. Room with a view.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.708
Meet you there.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.212
Oh, boy.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.263
This isn't good. This isn't good.

28:01.556 --> 28:03.886
Come on. Come on.
This isn't...

28:09.438 --> 28:10.938
Come on, come on.

28:12.817 --> 28:14.937
Come on, come oh, come on.

28:36.507 --> 28:39.587
- Nuke-y. Come on, buddy.
- Nuke, nuke, nuke.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.260
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

28:43.681 --> 28:46.271
Oh, nuke, come on.

28:47.935 --> 28:51.105
Come here, nuke, nuke, nuke-y.

28:53.024 --> 28:54.194
Oh, nuke?

29:26.682 --> 29:29.312
I don't see this son-of-a-gun anywhere.

29:29.477 --> 29:32.937
Oh, no, the jackpot, man.
This is it. This is...

29:33.105 --> 29:34.565
This is his workstation.

29:34.732 --> 29:37.322
Man, this guy is a slob.

29:37.777 --> 29:41.987
- Look at the... look at all this junk.
- Focus, man. We're here to do a job.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.829
He's got something in here.
I know he's got something.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.826
Wait, wait, wait.

29:52.375 --> 29:53.875
That's us.

29:54.919 --> 29:56.959
Look, he's been watching us
the whole time.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.419
Man.

30:00.049 --> 30:02.759
All right, he's gotta be around
here somewhere. Come on.

30:04.053 --> 30:05.143
Wait.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.894
What's that beeping noise?

30:09.100 --> 30:11.270
It's coming from over here.

30:16.107 --> 30:18.647
Fire extinguishers don't beep.

30:28.619 --> 30:30.499
- Oh, crap.
- Oh, crap.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.883
Did nuke make it out alive?

30:39.422 --> 30:43.592
Well, he is the smart one,
so I hope he finds a way out.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.594
Just like old times, huh?

31:17.877 --> 31:19.587
Yeah. Just like.

31:20.129 --> 31:22.879
Still coming to my rescue.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.258
Listen, I...

31:25.426 --> 31:27.216
I know we haven't talked much since...

31:27.386 --> 31:30.176
We've been pretty busy, yeah.

31:30.389 --> 31:34.519
Team's been getting shot at daily.

31:34.727 --> 31:37.647
Someone's gotta
get the bad guys, right?

31:37.813 --> 31:41.783
I'm sure Nitti's busy.

31:42.026 --> 31:43.486
<i>Nitti.</i>

31:43.652 --> 31:45.572
God, that man
must love what he does.

31:46.197 --> 31:48.237
He's definitely
not doing it for the money.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.277
None of us are.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.703
We do it because it's right.

31:53.704 --> 31:54.964
Listen.

31:55.122 --> 31:57.252
This new guy.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.168
He's no joke, okay?

32:01.337 --> 32:03.877
Snitch told me his name.

32:05.633 --> 32:07.723
He's nobody to be messed with.

32:07.885 --> 32:09.385
What's his name?

32:10.387 --> 32:12.307
- Muerte.
- Oh, my god.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.139
Could you get
any more cliché than that?

32:15.351 --> 32:17.061
It's a clichéd town.

32:17.228 --> 32:18.228
True.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.108
- Yeah?
<i>- They</i> got to us.

32:23.317 --> 32:25.397
- Who?
- I don't know.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.701
I'm guessing our new secret admirers.

32:28.656 --> 32:29.696
Status?

32:29.907 --> 32:31.447
<i>I blew it to fragments.</i>

32:33.369 --> 32:34.579
Anything left?

32:34.787 --> 32:36.497
Well, me, and...

32:36.831 --> 32:38.791
<i>every bit of our digital world.</i>

32:41.669 --> 32:43.549
All right, call the team.

32:44.338 --> 32:46.258
Let's meet at...

32:46.757 --> 32:47.757
l-37.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.300
<i>Copy that. On it.</i>

32:54.890 --> 32:56.100
Three times today.

32:57.685 --> 33:00.895
This morning, with you at the bar...

33:01.105 --> 33:02.265
and my hideout.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.149
Self-destruct?

33:06.152 --> 33:09.572
Dude really knows
how to make an explosive exit.

33:10.364 --> 33:12.624
Muerte just got to town.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.285
Why come after the two of us'?

33:14.493 --> 33:16.873
- I haven't heard any chatter.
- Yeah, me neither.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.867
I mean, he obviously wants both of us
out of the way.

33:20.082 --> 33:23.002
We only have two things in common.

33:23.210 --> 33:26.340
I mean, we both protect the city and...

33:32.928 --> 33:35.348
It's been a long time since
we had that in common.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.314
It's a great conversation starter, though.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.015
Yeah.

33:40.895 --> 33:43.475
Listen, Muerte...

33:44.023 --> 33:45.273
he's on a roll.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.569
Who's he working with?

33:48.736 --> 33:52.066
I thought you and Erlik
had an "agreement"?

33:52.239 --> 33:55.579
We do. It's not Erlik or his guys.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.294
It's not his style.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.373
Well, then whose style is it?

33:59.997 --> 34:01.577
- I don't know.
- Maybe...

34:01.790 --> 34:05.750
someone we put behind bars got out?
You know, wants to settle the score?

34:10.966 --> 34:12.585
So...

34:13.469 --> 34:16.219
ever think about us...

34:16.388 --> 34:19.058
and the way we...?

34:19.266 --> 34:25.266
Look, Riley,
we had something amazing, okay?

34:25.856 --> 34:31.065
But, I mean, there's no safety
in our job, right?

34:35.074 --> 34:37.583
We don't know if we'll be home or not.

34:37.743 --> 34:38.743
I know that.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.661
I've always known that.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.462
When I got hurt...

34:46.543 --> 34:49.003
and you didn't think I'd make it...

34:49.380 --> 34:52.010
you totally disconnected from me...

34:52.216 --> 34:56.386
friends, family, everyone.

35:01.642 --> 35:02.852
Your team good?

35:04.645 --> 35:07.435
Yeah, team's good, everyone's healthy.

35:07.648 --> 35:09.318
Flying under the radar.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.492
Fighting crime for free.

35:15.406 --> 35:16.866
I miss you.

35:17.950 --> 35:20.410
Why don't you and your team...

35:23.080 --> 35:24.420
stay with me.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.963
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

35:27.167 --> 35:29.627
Well, that's like moving in together.

35:29.837 --> 35:32.007
I'm serious, okay? It's safer.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.133
So...

35:34.842 --> 35:37.852
I'm gonna go. Yeah.

35:48.439 --> 35:50.439
I'm glad we had this talk.

35:51.108 --> 35:52.148
Give me all your money.

35:52.609 --> 35:53.649
I'll cut her.

35:53.819 --> 35:57.199
- Boy.
- You have the worst luck at picking girls.

35:57.364 --> 36:00.994
I'm gonna give you to the count of three
to get that knife off of my neck.

36:01.577 --> 36:02.747
One.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.120
Two.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.621
Three.

36:31.231 --> 36:32.691
What?

36:40.991 --> 36:44.161
No way. Riley can freeze time?

36:44.370 --> 36:46.330
That's what her amulet does.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.720
How many dead?
How many survivors?

36:58.258 --> 37:01.258
Afraid there's nothing left
but a pair of boots and scrap metal.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.718
Apparently, the fire set off
a bunch of grenades.

37:03.931 --> 37:05.641
Not grenades,
they were blackfire's balls.

37:05.974 --> 37:09.274
I've heard about your theories.
"Hulk smash!" Right?

37:09.728 --> 37:12.358
Yeah, we wonder about you
sometimes, Nitti.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.979
Good evening, detective Nitti.
Busy night?

37:16.527 --> 37:17.897
Looks to get busier.

37:18.112 --> 37:21.322
Callan's team is changing locations.
Someone foreclosed on their hideout.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.908
Still chasing, right? Yeah?

37:24.118 --> 37:25.118
Making any progress?

37:25.285 --> 37:29.155
Same as always. Day late, dollar short.
But soon. I got one of those feelings.

37:29.373 --> 37:30.793
I'm sure. Have fun with that.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.378
I'm gonna look for some gremlins.

37:34.211 --> 37:35.301
Good luck.

37:36.046 --> 37:38.216
Well, here we are.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.304
Yep. Here we are.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.257
<i>So, what's your story, Nitti?</i>

37:42.719 --> 37:45.889
I mean, if cross and his team
are the good guys, right...

37:46.306 --> 37:48.516
then why are you dead set
on catching them?

37:48.725 --> 37:50.055
I don't like competition.

37:50.269 --> 37:51.559
I've heard that about you.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.441
Well, see you around, Nitti.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.529
By the way, it's no competition.

37:59.194 --> 38:02.164
Cross and his team
catch a lot more bad guys than you do.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.846
Anyone know
where the light switch is?

38:26.013 --> 38:27.013
Yeah, I got a box.

38:44.948 --> 38:48.288
There we go. All right, folks.

38:49.870 --> 38:52.210
Pizzle-fire, put that back.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.041
This is nice.

38:55.209 --> 38:57.089
Dump it on this table.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.723
All right, vests on this end.

39:23.904 --> 39:25.534
All right, folks, load the mags.

39:25.697 --> 39:26.987
We got a lot of work to do.

39:28.158 --> 39:30.908
- All right, look at that.
- Not bad.

39:32.412 --> 39:33.542
Shark.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.830
- Here's your battleaxe, brother.
- Thanks, brother.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.085
Fix the stock on this one here.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.261
So only the necessities?

39:44.466 --> 39:46.836
Yeah. I'll be traveling light.

39:47.844 --> 39:49.394
As you do.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.774
It's what we're doing.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.610
Welcome home, guys.

40:00.816 --> 40:02.816
The ultimate man cave.

40:02.985 --> 40:07.025
Nothing but bricks, cement...

40:07.406 --> 40:09.576
and me.

40:11.868 --> 40:13.698
I think it could use a woman's touch.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.620
I could too.

40:15.789 --> 40:19.039
- Yeah, yeah. Actually, I bet you could.
- All right.

40:21.044 --> 40:23.674
It was... it's a dud.
I promise it wasn't gonna go off.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.880
It just, you know...

40:26.425 --> 40:28.255
Pizzle-fire.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.472
You drop your balls one more time...

40:30.679 --> 40:34.099
I'm gonna shove them
up your turd-cutter for safekeeping.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.346
- You got me?
- Yeah. I got you.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.098
- He'll do it.
- Get to work.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.190
Okay, I'm gonna get to work.

40:42.024 --> 40:44.444
Muerte sends his regards.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.897
His final regards.

40:52.868 --> 40:55.038
So long, Erlik.

41:12.596 --> 41:13.966
Hey-

41:14.139 --> 41:15.139
what have we got?

41:15.307 --> 41:17.477
An anonymous call.
They heard gunshots.

41:17.643 --> 41:20.063
- How many dead?
- It's easier to count the survivors.

41:20.228 --> 41:22.108
I'll play that game.
How many survivors?

41:22.272 --> 41:24.612
- If we include everyone?
- Of course.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.400
None.

41:27.569 --> 41:29.699
- Erlik?
- Him too.

41:29.905 --> 41:31.985
- Really? Erlik too?
- Are you sure?

41:32.199 --> 41:33.449
Someone finally got to him.

41:34.451 --> 41:35.741
It doesn't make any sense.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.214
Erlik was playing it cool.
Basically running a legit business.

41:39.414 --> 41:41.483
It takes big kahunas
to put a hit on Erlik.

41:41.508 --> 41:43.528
Yeah. Even bigger
ones to pull it off.

41:43.669 --> 41:44.749
Any suspects?

41:44.920 --> 41:47.800
Not yet, but I'll figure it out.
Real question is why?

41:48.006 --> 41:50.216
It'd be a big reason
to take out the crime boss.

41:50.592 --> 41:52.262
There's gonna be a ripple effect.

41:52.469 --> 41:55.139
Sure will.
Every time it runs down to my lap.

41:55.305 --> 41:58.475
It wasn't your grim Robin hood.
They were on good terms.

41:58.892 --> 42:02.232
She knows you well.
She knows you're a big cross fan.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.817
Who knows?
Could have been the girls.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.533
They take out the trash.

42:06.692 --> 42:10.152
Not a chance. This is too dirty for a pack
of heavily armed supermodels.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.820
This wasn't cross
or the Mickey mouse girls club.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.991
They had a truce.
Neither would break it.

42:17.911 --> 42:19.751
Great, now the whole world's
gonna know.

42:21.498 --> 42:23.078
Who's our lucky winners tonight?

42:23.250 --> 42:24.630
This is not good, Lisa.

42:24.835 --> 42:25.875
Do tell.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.174
Someone took out the whole crew.
Even Erlik.

42:28.380 --> 42:31.050
- Erlik? Are you sure?
- Dead sure.

42:31.842 --> 42:32.972
I don't believe it.

42:33.176 --> 42:34.176
Neither did I.

42:34.678 --> 42:37.718
- Who would do such a thing?
- That's what I intend to find out.

42:37.931 --> 42:39.811
- Cross?
- No.

42:41.518 --> 42:42.978
Let's go find some bad guys.

42:43.145 --> 42:45.975
Isn't that what you pretty girls do?
Look for bad guys?

42:59.453 --> 43:02.213
Hey. How was the bar?
Did you see any cute guys?

43:02.414 --> 43:04.174
If you did, give them my number.

43:04.374 --> 43:06.424
Right. You're barely old enough
to date.

43:06.626 --> 43:10.126
You know, I beat down three thugs
last night for purse-stealing.

43:10.338 --> 43:11.798
I'm pretty sure I'm old enough.

43:12.007 --> 43:13.377
Give them my number instead.

43:13.550 --> 43:15.470
I haven't seen a cute guy in months.

43:15.635 --> 43:17.675
Ladies! Listen up.

43:19.222 --> 43:20.562
There's a new guy in town.

43:21.016 --> 43:22.806
And he's killing all the good guys.

43:23.018 --> 43:24.768
One by one.

43:24.978 --> 43:27.808
- Who is this guy?
- Yeah, where'd he even come from?

43:28.315 --> 43:29.815
He goes by Muerte.

43:30.150 --> 43:32.070
Him and his goons are already after us.

43:32.235 --> 43:34.275
They attacked me and Callan
at a bar tonight.

43:35.489 --> 43:38.619
Callan? As in cross Callan?

43:38.825 --> 43:40.195
Yeah. That Callan.

43:40.786 --> 43:42.246
Ran into him at the bar.

43:42.412 --> 43:44.872
He said his guys
were ambushed this morning.

43:45.081 --> 43:48.171
So what? He and his crew
eat guys like that for lunch.

43:48.376 --> 43:49.586
As do we.

43:51.838 --> 43:54.548
Guinevere, I'm not playing.
They want us dead.

43:54.758 --> 43:57.508
They can get in line,
because lots of people want us dead.

43:57.719 --> 44:00.429
You don't get it.
In the last 12 hours alone...

44:00.597 --> 44:04.347
they've attacked Callan and his men,
then attacked me and Callan at the bar...

44:04.518 --> 44:06.348
then broke into his headquarters.

44:06.812 --> 44:09.562
I don't know, call it a hunch.
I'm pretty sure we're next.

44:10.565 --> 44:12.065
So, what do you want us to do?

44:12.359 --> 44:14.279
Strike first.

44:14.486 --> 44:16.236
We get them before they get us.

44:16.947 --> 44:18.407
Now you're talking my language.

44:18.615 --> 44:21.025
I'm in.
What are we sitting around here for?

44:21.243 --> 44:22.243
Yeah, I'm ready.

44:22.410 --> 44:24.330
We could start
by cutting off their heads.

44:24.496 --> 44:27.246
- You know, bloody Mary style.
- Yes, nice.

44:27.874 --> 44:31.384
Or we could capture and torture them.
It's always more fun that way.

44:31.545 --> 44:35.125
Ladies! Callan's
already on his way over.

44:35.340 --> 44:36.680
We're gonna stay with them.

44:37.801 --> 44:39.011
We're stronger in numbers.

44:39.511 --> 44:41.931
That's ridiculous.
We don't need protection.

44:43.223 --> 44:44.893
We are the protectors.

44:45.100 --> 44:47.060
Come on.
I'm not going all the way there...

44:47.227 --> 44:50.057
- to listen to chocolate-fire talk.
- Oh, he's not so bad.

44:50.230 --> 44:52.070
- He's kind of cute.
- Then you go there...

44:52.274 --> 44:53.904
- and you listen to him.
- Come on.

44:54.067 --> 44:55.937
- He's got a few good jokes.
- This is so lame.

44:56.152 --> 44:58.492
Calm it down! Calm it down.

44:58.697 --> 45:01.067
Now, Riley has never steered us wrong.

45:01.241 --> 45:02.911
Besides, it's always a good idea...

45:03.076 --> 45:04.826
not to get too comfortable...

45:05.328 --> 45:07.998
If you want to make it through
we need to stick together.

45:09.541 --> 45:11.791
The last place any of you want to be...

45:12.377 --> 45:14.337
is on the dying end of a kill.

45:34.608 --> 45:37.188
Hey, man, spare some change?

45:37.402 --> 45:39.202
Hey, he's talking to you.

45:40.322 --> 45:42.122
Hey, punk!

45:42.490 --> 45:44.700
Give me your change!

46:01.468 --> 46:02.468
All right.

46:02.636 --> 46:06.846
This place should be fully
operational by morning.

46:07.015 --> 46:09.095
So work fast.

46:09.309 --> 46:12.649
Oh, you guys take a break. I got it.

46:13.772 --> 46:16.442
A little work goes a long ways.

46:16.650 --> 46:18.150
You keep your head in the game.

46:18.318 --> 46:19.648
And out of your ass.

46:19.861 --> 46:21.861
Out of my ass.

46:23.365 --> 46:25.445
They came for Riley.

46:26.368 --> 46:27.738
Riley?

46:30.080 --> 46:31.670
What are you talking about, Riley?

46:31.831 --> 46:33.121
Where'd you see her?

46:33.291 --> 46:35.211
Peter's bar.

46:36.503 --> 46:37.963
Ran into her there.

46:38.171 --> 46:41.221
You ran into her?
Like, like physically, like...

46:41.424 --> 46:44.474
- ran into her with one leg up?
- Pizzle-fire.

46:44.844 --> 46:47.934
I was just trying to make light... okay.

46:49.432 --> 46:52.892
Pretty damn brave of them to
come after you both at the same time.

46:53.144 --> 46:57.364
Two amulets together,
that's some pretty hot firepower.

46:57.524 --> 47:00.244
Yeah, you guys were quite
the fighting pair, remember?

47:00.819 --> 47:03.069
I don't think they knew that I was there.

47:03.238 --> 47:04.318
How's that?

47:06.074 --> 47:07.874
They only sent four guys.

47:09.911 --> 47:13.871
So I told Riley to come stay here
with her team.

47:15.583 --> 47:16.583
Yeah.

47:17.168 --> 47:18.918
We need to watch them.

47:19.087 --> 47:21.167
Do you not remember
how that went...

47:21.339 --> 47:23.429
- the last time you did that?
- It's fine.

47:23.633 --> 47:25.593
You know, it's not a bad idea.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.350
With Guinevere and everyone.

47:27.554 --> 47:29.814
- She's pretty hot.
- Yeah, she is hot.

47:30.015 --> 47:31.215
Stop. Both of you.

47:31.433 --> 47:33.103
Just saying.

47:33.727 --> 47:35.147
No.

47:39.816 --> 47:41.186
<i>- Yeah?
- Is this line secure?</i>

47:41.401 --> 47:44.241
I found something
you'll definitely be interested in.

47:47.115 --> 47:50.195
All right. I'll be there in 15.

47:50.410 --> 47:51.870
Don't be late.

47:54.581 --> 47:56.421
That was the snitch...

47:56.583 --> 48:00.463
and he has some intel.
So I'll be back.

48:00.670 --> 48:02.550
Watch your back.

48:04.674 --> 48:06.724
Off so soon?

48:06.885 --> 48:11.345
You just got here. We didn't even
get a chance to Netflix and chill.

48:11.556 --> 48:13.556
- I make a mean guac.
- God.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.280
Hey-

48:27.447 --> 48:29.237
heard some bums
got beat up pretty bad.

48:29.449 --> 48:32.249
Beat up? They're in multiple pieces.
I don't think "beat up" covers it.

48:32.327 --> 48:34.827
Did you get any DNA evidence
off the confiscated items?

48:34.996 --> 48:37.496
- There's gonna be trouble with that.
- What trouble?

48:37.665 --> 48:41.665
Well, when I came back
from upstairs, stuff was missing.

48:41.878 --> 48:43.758
Missing?
What do you mean, missing?

48:43.963 --> 48:46.383
Well, I came back and it was all gone.

48:46.591 --> 48:47.721
No idea what happened.

48:47.926 --> 48:49.506
No one has a key to get in here.

48:49.677 --> 48:51.047
What exactly is missing?

48:51.262 --> 48:54.522
Well, everything. All of it.
Every item is missing.

48:54.682 --> 48:58.392
Nothing left
but belly lint and blood.

48:58.645 --> 48:59.895
Have any idea who took it?

49:02.315 --> 49:03.395
The snitch.

49:03.566 --> 49:05.646
- The snitch?
- Yeah. Right under our noses.

49:05.860 --> 49:07.650
Had to be someone
with inside contacts.

49:07.821 --> 49:09.491
Some law-breaking worthless bastard.

49:09.697 --> 49:12.277
- Yeah.
- The snitch.

49:18.706 --> 49:21.626
Callan. Right on time.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.674
- Hello?
- You <i>ready?</i>

49:24.838 --> 49:26.338
- Yeah.
- How's your <i>team?</i>

49:26.673 --> 49:27.723
Ready to rock.

49:27.882 --> 49:30.392
<i>I got the intel. Multiple threats.</i>

49:30.552 --> 49:32.512
Roger that. We'll be ready.

49:32.679 --> 49:34.969
<i>We'll be there in a few. Okay?</i>

49:35.140 --> 49:37.980
- Callan, I...
- Stay sharp.

49:38.393 --> 49:40.103
<i>Be ready for anything.</i>

49:40.270 --> 49:42.150
Okay. I'll see you in a few.

49:44.023 --> 49:46.653
- You okay?
- What'd he say'?

49:46.818 --> 49:48.608
- To be ready.
- Oh, we're ready.

49:48.778 --> 49:50.278
The question is...

49:51.114 --> 49:53.744
- are you?
- What's that supposed to mean?

49:53.950 --> 49:55.620
You can handle yourself in a fight.

49:55.827 --> 50:00.577
But handling your feelings for Callan
is a whole different story.

50:00.748 --> 50:01.878
I'll be fine.

50:02.083 --> 50:03.963
That's what you said last time.

50:06.045 --> 50:07.375
And then he almost died.

50:08.256 --> 50:10.296
Yeah. He recovered. You didn't.

50:10.466 --> 50:13.886
Girls, listen. I'll be fine.

50:15.138 --> 50:17.928
All right, I've loaded the mags
and prepped your weapons.

50:18.308 --> 50:20.598
Ladies, make me proud.

50:21.352 --> 50:25.522
Cold hard steel.
Sexiest way to get a man's attention.

50:27.984 --> 50:29.944
<i>- Gunnar's back.</i>
- What?

50:31.237 --> 50:33.067
He died on the roof. I was there.

50:33.281 --> 50:35.031
- Did you see him?
- No.

50:35.241 --> 50:37.541
- Explain, please.
- Ls this based on science...

50:37.744 --> 50:40.214
fact, or merely
one of your rumors on the street?

50:45.251 --> 50:46.461
What the...?

50:46.628 --> 50:47.878
He...

50:48.504 --> 50:50.924
<i>He chopped up
these homeless guys downtown.</i>

50:51.132 --> 50:52.512
Trusted intel?

50:52.717 --> 50:53.837
<i>Snitch.</i>

50:54.052 --> 50:56.472
That's impossible.
We blew him into a million pieces.

50:56.638 --> 50:59.468
- They couldn't even identify him.
- You know...

50:59.682 --> 51:04.692
Gunnar told Erlik that he'd been around
for thousands of years.

51:04.854 --> 51:07.614
I heard about that.
It's some type of curse, right?

51:07.815 --> 51:09.315
That he's gonna live forever...

51:09.525 --> 51:11.985
or until everyone dies.
But, you guys...

51:13.404 --> 51:15.664
- I mean, we're still alive, so...
- My cross...

51:17.200 --> 51:22.330
<i>gave him everything it had.
It took, like, a week to recharge.</i>

51:22.538 --> 51:25.168
Then we'll have to
find another way to stop him.

51:25.917 --> 51:27.587
<i>Okay, nuke. What do you have?</i>

51:29.963 --> 51:32.013
I probably have something
I can modify. I...

51:32.215 --> 51:34.755
It'll take some work.
Give me a little bit of time.

51:34.968 --> 51:37.548
- We don't have any time.
- We don't have any time at all.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.220
Just think of some lightning
and thunder and mix it up...

51:40.431 --> 51:42.521
Guys, guys, I'll figure it out.
I always do.

51:42.725 --> 51:46.265
In the meantime, you go kick him,
shoot him, thump him and pound him.

51:46.479 --> 51:48.979
- Thump him?
- Do what you do.

51:49.148 --> 51:50.608
Just don't kill him.

51:50.817 --> 51:52.737
<i>He's gotta be working with Muerte.</i>

51:52.944 --> 51:55.284
<i>I mean, it's his normal m.O.</i>

51:56.239 --> 51:57.409
Callan.

51:58.825 --> 52:01.945
<i>Hang tight. All right? See you in a bit.</i>

53:04.557 --> 53:06.137
Pretty impressive.

53:06.309 --> 53:08.019
Right on time.

53:08.186 --> 53:10.726
Welcome back
to the temporary land of the living.

53:11.856 --> 53:15.316
You look great
for someone who's been dead forever.

53:16.152 --> 53:18.072
Moisturizer.

53:19.614 --> 53:22.204
Right on time, my friend. You're good.

53:22.408 --> 53:25.118
Yeah, it's not my first rodeo.

53:26.329 --> 53:27.329
Is it nearly ready?

53:27.497 --> 53:29.417
Rome wasn't built in a day. You know?

53:29.624 --> 53:31.254
It took a lot longer than that.

53:32.752 --> 53:35.052
Those were the days, huh?

53:35.254 --> 53:37.134
Did you follow my instructions?

53:37.298 --> 53:39.298
Absolutely.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.047
And Muerte?

53:41.260 --> 53:44.560
As we speak, I'm working on it.
We'll give him his cash.

53:44.764 --> 53:47.104
But he won't be able to spend it.

53:48.976 --> 53:51.436
Poorohap.
He doesn't know he's gonna die tonight.

53:51.646 --> 53:53.226
Did you get everything you needed?

53:53.398 --> 53:55.438
I got all the elements.

53:55.608 --> 53:57.738
All we need is more power.

54:00.780 --> 54:03.570
We'll have more power
than you ever thought of.

54:03.741 --> 54:07.911
Last time
it didn't go the way we planned.

54:09.997 --> 54:14.087
But you're lucky you have me,
and I have plan b.

54:14.502 --> 54:16.422
I see you've been living like a king.

54:16.629 --> 54:17.879
Like an American president.

54:18.047 --> 54:21.337
Fast cars, fast girls. Lots of money.

54:21.509 --> 54:23.179
Thanks for the bank card.

54:23.678 --> 54:26.848
And all this just from one little machine.

54:27.932 --> 54:29.562
This little machine.

54:30.059 --> 54:35.819
This little machine creates a swarm
of free-flying quarks.

54:36.566 --> 54:39.936
And do I look like the kind of guy
that reads up on flying quarks?

54:40.611 --> 54:42.031
Did you hear what I said?

54:42.530 --> 54:45.070
Free-flying quarks?

54:45.533 --> 54:50.123
I don't care as long as we can
kill everybody and I can finally die.

54:52.165 --> 54:53.785
How long will it take?

54:54.500 --> 54:55.750
Not long, my friend.

54:55.918 --> 54:58.048
Every atom in the universe
will be destroyed.

54:58.463 --> 55:01.133
And you're willing to end it all
for one peek of the end?

55:02.049 --> 55:04.049
It's actually a peek of beginning.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.352
Now get this machine working.

55:06.512 --> 55:07.512
I'm on it.

55:28.451 --> 55:29.661
Look out!

55:29.827 --> 55:31.327
Get them!

55:38.252 --> 55:39.422
Behind you!

55:40.046 --> 55:41.416
Behind you, look out!

56:10.409 --> 56:12.369
The boss wants to see you unharmed.

56:12.954 --> 56:14.414
Lucky for you.

56:23.798 --> 56:25.338
- Riley!
- I got her.

56:40.773 --> 56:42.403
They took Riley.

56:48.447 --> 56:50.987
Hey, did Callan say
when he was gonna call?

56:51.200 --> 56:52.740
No. It's like watching grass grow.

56:53.119 --> 56:54.909
I look, nothing.

56:55.121 --> 56:58.331
I look again, still nothing.

57:01.961 --> 57:06.841
You know, I kind of enjoy the downtime.

57:07.008 --> 57:08.798
You know? I needed this break.

57:09.010 --> 57:11.300
The snacks too.
You know I love my snacks.

57:13.389 --> 57:14.389
Yeah, well...

57:15.391 --> 57:17.351
I'll be glad...

57:17.852 --> 57:21.812
when we're slinging hot lead
back down range again.

57:24.692 --> 57:25.692
Ready, pizzle-fire?

57:27.361 --> 57:28.611
Because hell's coming.

57:28.821 --> 57:31.621
Yeah, Gunnar's
a different kind of animal.

57:31.824 --> 57:32.954
Can't kill him.

57:33.826 --> 57:34.826
I'm not worried.

57:34.994 --> 57:37.964
Just, he's just gonna die and reincarnate.

57:39.040 --> 57:40.790
Or some freaky shit.

57:41.250 --> 57:42.290
I'm ready.

57:42.460 --> 57:44.710
You don't understand.
It's like pulling a weed.

57:44.879 --> 57:46.169
It just comes right back.

57:47.048 --> 57:49.878
We're in luck. I have weed killer.

57:51.135 --> 57:53.005
- You okay?
<i>- I'll</i> live.

57:53.638 --> 57:57.218
Riley said they were coming,
and we completely blew it off.

57:57.725 --> 58:01.475
They ambushed us. We weren't ready,
and now they have Riley.

58:01.687 --> 58:04.857
<i>- I'll</i> get her back.
- We. We will get her back.

58:05.066 --> 58:07.316
- She's our girl. You're not in this alone.
- Yeah.

58:08.235 --> 58:09.775
We're helping.

58:09.987 --> 58:11.027
Let's do it.

58:11.489 --> 58:12.949
Go.

58:14.617 --> 58:16.237
Let's get our girl.

58:18.996 --> 58:21.496
- Will Callan save Riley?
- I hope so.

58:21.666 --> 58:23.326
They make a pretty good team.

58:27.755 --> 58:29.295
Look at you.

58:29.465 --> 58:32.045
You brought a pretty penny.

58:32.218 --> 58:33.888
All that money.

58:34.387 --> 58:36.097
For you...

58:37.056 --> 58:39.306
and this amulet.

58:41.268 --> 58:43.268
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey!

58:46.357 --> 58:48.277
Better save that energy, honey.

58:49.694 --> 58:52.114
I understand
you're going to quite the party.

58:54.573 --> 58:56.333
Take her to Gunnar.

58:56.534 --> 58:58.124
And bring back our money.

58:58.285 --> 58:59.905
Oh, yeah.

59:00.079 --> 59:01.159
Don't forget this.

59:02.623 --> 59:05.293
Things are starting to get interesting.

59:08.003 --> 59:09.303
Gunnar's gonna enjoy you.

59:13.175 --> 59:14.795
Won't be long, now.

59:15.010 --> 59:17.180
Almost ready to be tested.

59:17.346 --> 59:20.016
The bait will be here soon
and Callan will come running.

59:20.474 --> 59:23.024
You have special hate for that guy.

59:23.477 --> 59:26.307
- I like it.
- I wasn't always in the hating game.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.320
First thousand years I lived to love.

59:28.524 --> 59:30.904
It was the second thousand years
I lived to hate.

59:34.363 --> 59:36.573
Done. It's ready.

59:36.741 --> 59:38.911
Well, let's see a sample.

59:43.205 --> 59:44.365
Ready?
- Yep.

59:50.713 --> 59:53.513
Good. Very good.

59:53.674 --> 59:55.684
Now let's see its potential.

01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:19.199
Will that machine
destroy the whole world?

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:25.038
That machine is gonna destroy
the whole universe and everything in it.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:33.709
Yeah.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.220
Okay, don't worry. I'll take care of it.

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:39.427
All right.

01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:44.731
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready.

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:47.064
It's time to go to work.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:49.809
So get all your weapons together.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.820
It's gonna be a long night.

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:56.069
What's this thing do?

01:00:57.947 --> 01:00:59.447
How does it work?

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:01.407
That's a great question.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:04.245
Come closer. Watch this one thing.

01:01:04.453 --> 01:01:05.453
Come here.

01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:07.411
Does it feel good?

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:09.081
You won't feel a thing.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:23.056
- It's pretty.
- So perfect.

01:01:32.398 --> 01:01:34.108
It tingles.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.830
Goodbye to the world, hello to the end.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.043
Listen, we just got this new place...

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.461
and he's already inviting guests.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:57.968
It won't be long before
we're looking for a new hideout.

01:01:58.132 --> 01:02:03.102
I mean, what is the purpose
of having a hideout if we don't hide?

01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:10.558
You know, you could always hide.
Somewhere where no one speaks.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:13.443
That's real funny. All I'm saying is...

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:17.817
there's no good reason for him
to be bringing people to our hideout.

01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:20.605
Hey, the bad guys got Riley.
It's a good enough reason.

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:22.031
Not good enough, Jack.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.494
Pizzle-fire.

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:28.407
Now, if Callan says they're cool...

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:30.866
they're cool.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.540
Plus, we need the manpower.

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:35.839
- Got it?
- I got it.

01:02:36.337 --> 01:02:38.257
I don't care if they the marines.

01:02:38.464 --> 01:02:39.884
I need my sleep.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.340
Boys. Separate.

01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:44.641
He grabbed me first.

01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:47.433
Listen, we need to focus on
getting Riley back safely.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.220
That's what we're doing, okay?

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.311
Regardless of all that, I'm just...

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:53.808
I'm just not ready for
any new teammates.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.610
I have enough trouble
with the ones I have.

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:59.364
Like quiet riot here.

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:03.447
- You want to bang your head?
- That's not banging, it's slicing.

01:03:03.656 --> 01:03:06.656
- I could help you feel the noise.
- I don't want to feel no noise.

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:08.445
I'm not a rock star.

01:03:09.161 --> 01:03:11.251
Listen here, duck dynasty, I'm...

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:12.463
Hey!

01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:15.375
Callan, what's going...
We was just talking about you, man.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.382
The guac I said I was gonna make...

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:19.756
it's in the fridge, you know?
Go ahead and...

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:21.054
Oh, hey.

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:24.223
Oh, this is...

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:32.136
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:36.187
Ladies, hey, how you doing?

01:03:36.355 --> 01:03:38.565
Welcome. Make yourselves at home.

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:39.782
You guys look nice.

01:03:39.942 --> 01:03:42.112
You know, maybe like the
housewives of Rambo...

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:43.697
but we can deal with that.

01:03:43.904 --> 01:03:45.704
We can deal with that.

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:47.324
You guys may have heard of me.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:52.787
I'm blackfire, resident explosives expert.
You know what I mean?

01:03:53.539 --> 01:03:55.369
Y'all know what I mean?
Okay. All right.

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:58.625
Puke, these ladies look like
they need some water.

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:01.296
Can you get them a round?
Get a round right quick?

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:04.215
Your legs ain't broke.
Fridge is over there. And it's nuke.

01:04:04.425 --> 01:04:05.965
- Not puke.
- Oh, okay.

01:04:06.135 --> 01:04:08.255
Fizzle-fire,
when's your cousin getting back?

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:11.060
Oh, he's spending some time
with our aunt. You know.

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:15.729
I was just trying to...

01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:17.233
Ladies.

01:04:17.396 --> 01:04:19.726
I heard you had a rough night.
Lost a soldier.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.360
- I heard you had a rough morning.
- Yeah.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:24.487
We're going back out tonight.

01:04:25.112 --> 01:04:27.912
Exact a little payback.

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:29.073
You all up for it?

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.830
We're always in.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.660
That's good to hear.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.620
All right.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.752
I see you met pizzle-fire here.

01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:39.499
Riot.

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:44.343
Make yourselves at home.
And don't listen to a word he says.

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:46.678
- Thanks for having us.
- Yeah, thank you.

01:04:50.763 --> 01:04:53.603
- What happened?
- They caught us off guard, that's what.

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:57.897
Yeah, they had these two giants
covered in armor from head to toe.

01:04:58.103 --> 01:04:59.983
Bullets didn't faze them, not at all.

01:05:00.189 --> 01:05:01.569
It's like they weren't human.

01:05:01.774 --> 01:05:02.944
Oh, they're human.

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.690
I'll prove it.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:08.032
Her shield couldn't hold up to
one of them and he took off with her.

01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:10.197
I mean, for giants,
they move really quick.

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:12.445
She didn't have a chance
to freeze motion.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.409
- She really can do that?
- Of course she can.

01:05:15.621 --> 01:05:18.121
Man, I gotta see that, because I like...

01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:25.088
We... we got him.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.085
We got... we... we got him!

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:28.677
Gunnar?

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:31.302
I'm sure of it. I knew I would find you!

01:05:31.512 --> 01:05:33.392
- Okay.
- We need a plan.

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:35.427
We have one.

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:39.103
We kill Gunnar, we get her back,
and put a muzzle on him.

01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:40.691
What?

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:43.106
I like that plan.

01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:44.975
How's that gadget?

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.820
I think it works.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.912
What do you mean "you think"?

01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:55.446
Just test it, nuke.

01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:56.701
I can't test it.

01:05:57.871 --> 01:05:58.961
It only works once.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:03.129
So make it count.
Once it's activated, that's it.

01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:10.968
Just how I like it. No bloodstains.

01:06:11.135 --> 01:06:14.755
Just suck the life out of the earth
and send it off into the abyss.

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:16.810
No sounds, no soul.

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:18.484
Not even a light.

01:06:18.684 --> 01:06:21.154
You certainly do like to settle the score.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.901
A little friend of mine,
he never left a score unsettled.

01:06:25.065 --> 01:06:26.105
Neither do I.

01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:29.282
There's been a lot of mass killers
in history.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:32.067
But you are the greatest one.

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:36.199
I'm not a mass killer. I'm a cleanser.

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:38.370
There won't be anyone to notice.

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:40.576
Finally the end.

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:43.327
I'll get the front row seat.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.718
Welcome, gents.

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:51.884
Welcome, young lady.

01:06:53.385 --> 01:06:54.465
Hey-

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:56.562
that's no way to hold a lady.

01:06:56.722 --> 01:06:58.852
Now put her down gently.

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:02.226
Yeah, right. This ain't no lady.

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:09.398
Now...

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.400
let me introduce myself.
My name's Gunnar.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.659
I'm the last person
you're ever gonna meet.

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.001
Yeah. Let's hope not.

01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:22.409
I'd hate to have such a terrible finish.

01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:24.923
Quite feisty. Fighter?

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:36.388
I'll keep hold of this for a bit.

01:07:36.929 --> 01:07:39.509
Just until your little boyfriend Callan
gets here.

01:07:40.641 --> 01:07:41.891
Yeah, that's right.

01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:43.639
You see, I know everything...

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.900
because I've been around
a long, long time.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.476
When he gets here,
I'm gonna kill him...

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:51.190
I'm gonna kill you,
and you can be together forever.

01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:55.699
Now I've got your attention.

01:07:56.323 --> 01:07:58.083
How does this thing work, anyhow?

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.910
It's gonna kill Callan.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.330
How does it do it?

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:05.502
That's a good question.

01:08:05.874 --> 01:08:09.254
It's powered by the amulet,
which is powered by Riley.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:13.009
So, coincidentally,
Riley will end up killing Callan.

01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:14.632
Not bad.

01:08:15.092 --> 01:08:16.392
Oh, you're a monster!

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:18.011
Callan will stop you.

01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:21.468
That's it. You get mad,
because I hear the madder you get...

01:08:21.682 --> 01:08:24.772
the more you power up the amulet.
And we need power.

01:08:24.977 --> 01:08:26.227
How will Callan find us?

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.555
Oh, we left him a little calling card.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:32.152
Yeah. We shut down the valley.
He'll find us.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.710
All right, listen up, everybody.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:51.165
This is obviously a trap.

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:53.956
We're all gonna be walking in...

01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:56.091
but I ain't sure
if we're walking out.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:09:00.718
Yeah. It's just like
a '70s Batman show, right?

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.807
The joker sets a trap,
and he walks right into it.

01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:04.984
I always thought...

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:07.482
He's supposed to be the
world's smartest detective.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.154
- I never really got that, right?
- Pizzle-fire.

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:14.104
- Are you done?
- Yeah. I just wanted to get that out.

01:09:14.276 --> 01:09:19.276
You know, this is personal.
I believe Gunnar wants to watch us die.

01:09:19.448 --> 01:09:22.528
Well, regardless of whatever
his final motivations are...

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:24.576
he wants revenge first.

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.120
Wish him luck.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.082
I wish him dead.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:32.337
Sounds nasty.

01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:37.511
You don't know him like we do.

01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:41.304
He has Riley.

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:44.060
And there is only one way
we're getting her back.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:46.345
Walk right into a trap.

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:47.805
Exactly.

01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:51.308
- I like his style.
- I don't like a damn thing about him.

01:09:52.898 --> 01:09:54.228
Not a damn thing.

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:56.399
Don't mistake style for overconfidence.

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:59.200
I mean... okay.

01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:01.987
All right, listen up.

01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:05.041
Once we get inside,
we're gonna split up...

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:09.252
then we're gonna find these bastards
and waste them, plain and simple.

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:11.250
It sounds like a good plan.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:14.586
We'll clear the way, and hopefully
Callan will get his girl back.

01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:17.552
Why are we worried about
Callan getting his girl?

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:21.304
We're up here risking our lives for him?
How about we get the girl?

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:23.715
There's only one girl so we all know...

01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:25.639
who'll get the girl: Blackfire.

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:28.677
A nice, fine girl.
Thick at the top and at the bottom.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:31.690
I'm tired of this. I'm about to
take my butt back to Maryland.

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.563
"Where's blackfire at?" Y'all gonna...

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.610
- Dude, chill.
- No. Y'all need to chill.

01:10:35.774 --> 01:10:37.484
Pizzle-fire.

01:10:37.776 --> 01:10:39.566
If you can't keep your mouth closed...

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.906
I got something
to stick in your ball washer.

01:10:42.447 --> 01:10:44.277
Ball washer?

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:48.249
Why you always have to
say something so nasty?

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:50.082
Ball washer? What is a ball washer?

01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:52.248
You always wanna
stick something in something.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.922
That's why he always
keep them gloves on.

01:10:55.127 --> 01:10:56.337
Don't touch me.

01:10:57.504 --> 01:10:59.234
Will you let him touch you
with his stinky fingers?

01:10:59.256 --> 01:11:00.666
Stop talking.

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:12.017
He's here, right on time.

01:11:12.227 --> 01:11:14.557
- Is the machine ready?
- Yes.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:17.191
Once you add
the second power source...

01:11:17.566 --> 01:11:21.986
the Gauge hits a hundred percent,
press the button. Goodbye.

01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:25.566
You did good, bubba.
You did real good.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.910
Beautiful.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:45.388
Top security. Nobody's gonna find us.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:47.182
Pizzle-fire.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:50.135
They know we're coming.
Keep your mouth closed.

01:11:51.183 --> 01:11:52.433
Let's go.

01:11:52.851 --> 01:11:54.441
All right. Listen up, everybody.

01:11:54.603 --> 01:11:56.613
Here's to maximum violence.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.981
No hesitation, no mercy. You got it?

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.154
Stay sharp.

01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:04.819
And watch each other's six.
All right? My team, let's go.

01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:08.945
Shark, with me.

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:12.785
Saint, Lucia...

01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:14.084
with me.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:16.424
Watch your backs.

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:20.997
You ain't gotta tell me twice.
I'm already on it.

01:12:21.755 --> 01:12:23.045
Yes.

01:12:23.215 --> 01:12:25.375
Hey, good luck, blue balls.

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:27.590
Oh, well, we got luck.
We got luck...

01:12:28.345 --> 01:12:29.965
Somebody's gotta protect the girls.

01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:31.218
- No.
- We got it.

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:34.099
No. No. Come on.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:37.191
Stay frosty, boys.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:40.322
Head on a swivel. Watch these doors.

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:42.185
Contact right!

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:05.632
Freeze!

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.390
On your six.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.307
Listen.

01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:21.819
Don't get too far behind.

01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:24.646
- Harrison!
- Listen to me... that is...

01:13:24.818 --> 01:13:26.948
my government
and my mama call me that.

01:13:27.112 --> 01:13:29.952
You call me blackfire. It is blackfire.

01:13:30.115 --> 01:13:31.195
All right. Hey.

01:13:31.366 --> 01:13:32.696
- What?
- Don't drop your balls.

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:34.829
Exploding ordinance.

01:13:34.995 --> 01:13:35.995
Yeah. Whatever.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:38.672
- I told you.
- Whatever. Don't drop your balls.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:43.165
What'd you see?

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:44.376
I saw bad guys.

01:13:44.546 --> 01:13:46.336
Good. That's who we're looking for.

01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:50.046
- Now let's go get them.
- No. There's about 33 of them in there.

01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:52.262
- 33?
- 33.

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:54.759
- Do you know what 33 guys looks like?
- I know.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:57.681
33 Shaq-looking guys up in there.

01:13:57.851 --> 01:14:01.311
I'm not talking about the Shaq now.
I'm talking about the Shaq with Kobe.

01:14:01.605 --> 01:14:04.475
When he broke the glass.
That Shaq is in that room.

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:05.729
Count them again.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.530
- You need me to count them again?
- Count them again.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:09.948
<i>I'll help.</i>

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.997
- That's about 30 people.
- Yeah, that's 30.

01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:19.791
We would actually separate earlier.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.126
- If we separated earlier...
- I don't know.

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:24.214
- We would know exactly...
- If we split up...

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:26.002
- I think we should back up.
- How far?

01:14:26.171 --> 01:14:28.171
Like out into the street.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:29.878
What color was it?

01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:33.510
Cotton candy? I don't know.
Some colors I ain't never seen before.

01:14:34.846 --> 01:14:38.056
Why bend down and touch something
you don't even know what it is?

01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:41.225
- We should probably go.
- We should go.

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:49.276
- War and blackfire are funny.
- Yeah, they're pretty funny.

01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:50.864
If you like food.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:04.583
You okay, Jane?

01:15:06.086 --> 01:15:08.456
Next time, you be the bait.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:10.760
Can I shoot the next one?

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:13.051
Margo, let's get to work.

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:16.141
On it. All right, then.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:21.055
Well, lookie here. Well, well, well.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:22.597
Three hot chicks.

01:15:22.769 --> 01:15:25.269
I mean, I don't know whether
to kill them or date them.

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:28.358
You know, we got, what's this?
A gymnast, cheerleader...

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:31.896
and you. What is this, a pep rally?
You got pom-poms too? Yeah?

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:34.029
<i>Is it project runway?</i>

01:15:35.323 --> 01:15:38.033
You know what? Seriously.
You three can't handle us.

01:15:38.243 --> 01:15:40.503
- I mean, you already know.
- How about we make a bet?

01:15:42.122 --> 01:15:43.422
Sure. I like bets. You?

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:44.833
- Yeah.
- Okay, yeah.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.291
Okay. Let's see.

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:48.959
I bet...

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:51.589
- What's your name?
- Sam.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:54.133
Mike.

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:55.682
Mike. Sam and Mike.

01:15:57.345 --> 01:15:59.715
I bet that in less than six seconds...

01:15:59.931 --> 01:16:01.681
you and your little friends...

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:05.895
will be on the ground,
bloody and dead.

01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:21.867
In six seconds?

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.538
In six...

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.630
The little one.

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:32.456
Yeah. Okay, you...
Whatever, yeah. We'll take it. Okay, sure.

01:16:32.672 --> 01:16:34.222
- Okay.
- Yeah. All right. Six.

01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:36.094
- Five.
- Four

01:16:36.301 --> 01:16:37.931
- three.
- Two.

01:16:38.136 --> 01:16:39.546
One.

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:41.933
We're still here.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.733
- I think that was seven seconds.
- I think you're right.

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:53.609
Who's counting? Oh, wait. Yeah.
I was counting. It was seven seconds.

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:05.156
Hey, you guys seen Gunnar?

01:17:05.497 --> 01:17:07.117
That's a no.

01:17:11.795 --> 01:17:13.415
Well, well, look who we have here.

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:15.840
Don't move. Hands up.

01:17:16.758 --> 01:17:18.428
You too!

01:17:18.593 --> 01:17:20.183
I'll... I'll take that.

01:17:21.179 --> 01:17:23.139
Come here. Give me these too.

01:17:23.348 --> 01:17:25.308
I think we should tie them up.
All of them.

01:17:25.517 --> 01:17:27.887
Turn around. Turn around.

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:31.312
Turn around, all three of you.
Charlie angels.

01:17:36.361 --> 01:17:37.821
Can you let me have some fun?

01:17:38.488 --> 01:17:40.068
Hey, ladies.

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.080
- Looks like you needed help.
- Yeah.

01:17:44.285 --> 01:17:45.865
It's about time.

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:47.369
Let's go find the boys.

01:17:47.956 --> 01:17:51.126
Too bad. He was cute too.

01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:21.743
He shot me!

01:18:22.657 --> 01:18:23.907
- You all right?
- I'm good.

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:33.842
Get your hand grenades out.

01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:38.166
All right, here we go.

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:41.047
Left!

01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:48.061
Here we go!

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:51.272
Damn fine night to die, boys.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:53.477
Go, go, go!

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:53.541
Welcome, friends.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.290
And Callan.

01:19:59.504 --> 01:20:00.844
Just in time for the show.

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:09.309
- You good?
- I am now.

01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:11.854
Welcome to the show.
You're just in time.

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:14.766
I'm sure you're gonna see
it's gonna be a big show-stopper.

01:20:14.936 --> 01:20:16.056
Oh, good one, Gunnar.

01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:18.729
Did you practice your one-liners
when you were dead?

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:26.163
So I guess now you're gonna believe me
when I tell you I can't die.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.945
We really gonna do this again?

01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:33.291
Oh, absolutely.

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:36.962
Let's just say you beat me this time.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:38.956
What are you gonna do?

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.708
You gonna blow up the world?

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.880
Oh, yeah. That was the plan
long before you were born.

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:48.890
So this is just some personal desire?

01:20:50.138 --> 01:20:51.808
There's no honor in that.

01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:54.179
Honor? You're talking about...

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:55.890
How can you talk about honor...

01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:00.400
when you lead your team in there,
and Riley to their death.

01:21:00.565 --> 01:21:01.815
Where's the honor in that?

01:21:03.026 --> 01:21:05.396
Okay. Here's how
this is gonna play out.

01:21:07.155 --> 01:21:08.695
We're gonna stop you...

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:11.834
all of you...

01:21:12.035 --> 01:21:13.785
and then...

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.250
we're gonna show no mercy.

01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:20.838
And I thought you were just here
to rescue your little girlfriend.

01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:24.593
I mean, I don't see much
too special in her.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:28.217
- Go to hell!
- All in good time. All in good time.

01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:30.716
First you're gonna pay
for what you did last time.

01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:32.561
And, Callan...

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:37.022
just in case you're thinking that you
can use her power towards her amulet...

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:41.233
not gonna happen.
See, we have all the power now.

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:47.530
If she powers up
before I press this button...

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.950
the power will go straight
through her skull...

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:53.655
frying her brain.

01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:03.126
Let her go...

01:22:04.462 --> 01:22:07.552
and I'll make this
as painless as possible.

01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:10.337
You're in no position
to make deals, my friend.

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:24.567
So, Callan...

01:22:24.732 --> 01:22:26.612
we've taken the power of her amulet.

01:22:26.818 --> 01:22:29.898
Now we're gonna take yours
so you aren't such a nuisance to me.

01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:35.124
You guys...

01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:38.116
you want to take
the big elephants there?

01:22:38.329 --> 01:22:39.999
Yeah.

01:22:43.251 --> 01:22:44.791
Look, it's the ex-preacher.

01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:49.089
Did the word get too heavy?
Or was it the suit and white collar?

01:22:49.549 --> 01:22:53.179
Proverbs: "He who keeps his mouth
and keeps his tongue...

01:22:53.386 --> 01:22:55.046
keeps himself out of trouble."

01:22:55.721 --> 01:22:56.931
I guess you're in trouble.

01:22:57.765 --> 01:23:00.595
You think you can hurt me
with that little pea-shooter?

01:23:00.852 --> 01:23:02.732
Okay.

01:23:03.062 --> 01:23:04.612
have it your way.

01:23:07.358 --> 01:23:09.738
I think I'll have some fun.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.550
"On the day of judgment
you will give account...

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.850
for every careless word you speak."

01:24:19.764 --> 01:24:21.394
No!

01:24:22.058 --> 01:24:24.888
Stop! Get off of him!

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:29.732
You ready to quit yet?

01:24:38.616 --> 01:24:40.276
Yes.

01:24:43.663 --> 01:24:45.083
Hey!

01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:48.035
I wouldn't do it if I were you.

01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:58.140
All right, have a seat
with your girlfriend.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:06.687
Cuff him.

01:25:18.531 --> 01:25:20.411
That should do the trick, shouldn't it?

01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:23.326
Your little cross isn't gonna
do you much good now, is it?

01:25:25.246 --> 01:25:26.996
Wire him up.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.300
Is that what kills them?

01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:44.391
That's exactly what's gonna kill them.

01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:51.187
It's ready.

01:25:51.939 --> 01:25:53.319
Good job, Konrad.

01:25:56.027 --> 01:25:57.487
Well, this is goodbye, Callan.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:00.820
You've been a worthy opponent,
but somebody had to lose.

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:03.696
I love you.

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:44.244
I can stop it.

01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:47.582
You can't. It's too powerful.

01:26:47.787 --> 01:26:49.117
It's gonna kill me anyway.

01:26:50.623 --> 01:26:51.623
All of us.

01:26:51.832 --> 01:26:54.132
<i>- I'll</i> stop it.
- I have to try.

01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:16.614
No!

01:29:44.338 --> 01:29:45.588
You're right.

01:29:45.798 --> 01:29:47.798
Someone has to lose.

01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:02.355
Why doesn't Callan
just destroy Gunnar?

01:30:02.565 --> 01:30:05.315
Because he's immortal. He can't die.

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:15.044
It's ready.

01:30:15.869 --> 01:30:17.159
Good job, Konrad.

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:20.040
Well, this is goodbye, Callan.

01:30:20.207 --> 01:30:22.457
You've been a worthy opponent,
but somebody had to lose.

01:30:22.668 --> 01:30:23.838
I love you.

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:40.688
- What happened?
- This makes no sense.

01:30:40.853 --> 01:30:43.563
The machine is perfect.
It's supposed to work.

01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:45.694
It's supposed to work.

01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:48.239
It's supposed to work.

01:30:53.699 --> 01:30:56.579
I'm sure you're wondering
what went wrong...

01:30:57.119 --> 01:30:58.249
how I beat you again.

01:31:07.755 --> 01:31:10.915
It looks like I have the upper hand.

01:31:11.091 --> 01:31:13.011
But this time, it's a royal flush.

01:31:13.302 --> 01:31:15.762
Well, I don't play cards.

01:31:15.929 --> 01:31:17.809
Is that a new toy?

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:19.063
No.

01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:26.265
What is this?

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:33.236
This will never hold me.

01:31:33.489 --> 01:31:38.489
I'll see you in a million years or so.

01:31:40.871 --> 01:31:43.671
No. This ain't worth it.

01:31:44.375 --> 01:31:45.375
I'm out of here.

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:51.303
Me too. Let's roll.

01:32:16.907 --> 01:32:18.577
Keys?

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:22.036
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

01:32:22.204 --> 01:32:25.004
Hey, it's the spice girls.
You guys all right?

01:32:25.207 --> 01:32:26.667
- Yeah, we're good.
- Yeah.

01:32:26.834 --> 01:32:28.884
Yeah. How busy is this place?

01:32:29.086 --> 01:32:30.666
It seems to be pretty busy, right?

01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:33.218
Yeah, we just took out, like, 17 guys.

01:32:33.382 --> 01:32:38.552
Well, that's it?
We did like 34, 35, 36.

01:32:38.721 --> 01:32:40.851
- And here we go.
- You need to stop.

01:32:41.014 --> 01:32:42.814
You are just trying to one-up us.

01:32:43.016 --> 01:32:46.016
I'm not trying to one-up you.
You see this elbow? I was like:

01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:47.226
He can go all night.

01:32:48.814 --> 01:32:49.824
And here we go.

01:32:49.982 --> 01:32:52.532
And then I got the balls, like,
here, here I come.

01:32:52.735 --> 01:32:54.565
- Here I come.
- Blackfire.

01:32:55.654 --> 01:32:56.784
Stop. Knock it off.

01:32:56.947 --> 01:32:58.367
- You guys seen Callan?
- No.

01:32:58.532 --> 01:33:01.032
- No, I haven't.
- Saint? Lucia? Nothing?

01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:02.580
Let's go find them, guys.

01:33:02.745 --> 01:33:06.115
I don't want to, I want to go home.
I don't want to find them.

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:09.880
- Blackfire.
- What? I'm tired of this mission.

01:33:15.758 --> 01:33:18.008
They should make a movie
out of this comic book.

01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:22.638
Yeah, they should.
Comic book movies do really well.

01:33:30.439 --> 01:33:33.569
Well, ladies, we just got our edge.

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:35.936
Is that what I think it is?

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:37.531
It can't be.

01:33:39.656 --> 01:33:40.946
Another amulet?

01:34:30.707 --> 01:34:36.167
Believe me. When you see
what's coming next, you'll need me!

01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:38.838
Does Callan and Riley
get back together?

01:34:39.049 --> 01:34:41.219
Does blackfire go back to his city?

01:34:41.385 --> 01:34:45.505
Patience. You'll have to wait
and read volume three.

01:34:45.681 --> 01:34:47.431
After all, there is another amulet.

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:49.140
Now...

01:34:49.309 --> 01:34:52.189
let's get you to bed
because you have school tomorrow.

01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:54.114
Oh, fine.
