WEBVTT

00:00.668 --> 00:05.537
(Daniel whistling a tune)

00:05.606 --> 00:08.540
Aah! Lizard!

00:09.910 --> 00:13.879
(Anika) Jean Louise.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.481
Jean Louise.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.182
Jean Louise. (gasps)

00:17.251 --> 00:18.784
You found her!

00:18.853 --> 00:19.985
Anika, step back!

00:20.054 --> 00:21.553
That thing could eat you.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.789
Why would she eat me? I'm not a plant.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.391
What is that thing?

00:25.459 --> 00:28.761
She is not a thing. She is a chameleon.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.062
She's our class pet.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.630
Taking care of her this weekend.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.465
Shouldn't it be in like
a box or something?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.868
Mm-mm. I only do that
when I have to travel.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.202
Well, yeah, well, she can travel

00:37.271 --> 00:38.570
out of here right now.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.972
No, I need to feed her.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.241
She's probably hungry.
That's why she came here.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.243
You hungry, Jean Louise?

00:44.311 --> 00:46.879
Yeah? How 'bout some nice asparagus?

00:46.947 --> 00:48.213
Want to feed her?

00:48.282 --> 00:49.848
She'll eat right out of your hand.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.284
I-I-I'm good.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.453
Say, "Bye, Daniel."

00:54.522 --> 00:56.021
Bye.

01:03.497 --> 01:07.266
So, Josephine Hunter's
one true love is a rock?

01:07.334 --> 01:10.602
That's kind of sad when
you think about it.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.604
Poor Josephine.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.973
How much do you think
a diamond like this

01:15.042 --> 01:17.509
is actually worth?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.912
10 million. Give or take.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.747
Since when are you a diamond expert?

01:21.816 --> 01:23.682
I'm not, just saying
it's probably a lot.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.584
According to the Diamondpedia,

01:25.653 --> 01:26.819
the famous Hope Diamond,

01:26.887 --> 01:28.754
which is just as big and blue,

01:28.823 --> 01:32.758
was insured for 250 million U.S.
dollars.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.195
Lock every door and window!

01:36.263 --> 01:39.298
Nobody's coming in or out
without us knowing about it!

01:39.366 --> 01:41.633
Where do we hide the diamond?

01:41.702 --> 01:43.202
Let's put it in the cookie jar!

01:43.270 --> 01:44.736
We'll have to eat less cookies!

01:44.805 --> 01:45.838
Did you know that
diamonds are made of...

01:45.906 --> 01:47.039
Not now, Sal!

01:47.108 --> 01:48.974
(whistling)

01:49.043 --> 01:50.142
Why are we doing this?

01:50.211 --> 01:54.980
Duh! So no one steals this
jillion-dollar diamond.

01:55.049 --> 01:57.583
We should be doing the exact opposite.

01:57.651 --> 02:01.353
So, you're saying we want
somebody to steal the diamond?

02:01.422 --> 02:04.857
Not steal it, try to steal it.
Think about it.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.459
Saganash kidnapped Erik and Kate
because he wants the diamond.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.496
And if he knows it's here,
he's sure to try to steal it.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.098
All we have to do is catch him
when we get Kate and Erik back.

02:13.167 --> 02:16.335
But how do we let him know we have it?

02:16.403 --> 02:18.504
We don't even know who he is.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.172
Or if it's a he.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.775
What if it's a she? Or a they?

02:23.844 --> 02:25.277
There could be a whole
army of Saganashes.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.945
Chill, chill.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.847
You're gonna strain your brain. Look...

02:28.916 --> 02:32.017
this is a museum, right?

02:32.086 --> 02:33.852
So we'll put on a special exhibition.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.622
Advertise, tell the press.
Whatever it is museums do

02:36.690 --> 02:39.091
to spread the word about their shows.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.093
So what's our next move?

02:41.162 --> 02:44.630
We get to work. Sal and
I will build the trap.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.697
Tess and Anika, you go to the streets

02:45.766 --> 02:47.166
and spread the word about the show.

02:47.234 --> 02:50.002
Well, what about me? What do I do?

02:51.705 --> 02:55.440
I'm kind of hungry, so you can
make a sandwich or something.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.708
That'd be great. Thanks.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.477
No mustard on mine. I
want cheese on mine.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.724 --> 03:13.759
On view for the first
time in 300 years,

03:13.827 --> 03:15.661
the rarest diamond in the world!

03:15.729 --> 03:17.863
It's so shiny, you'll
probably go blind!

03:17.932 --> 03:19.031
You will not go blind!

03:19.099 --> 03:22.100
You might! No one will go blind.

03:22.169 --> 03:25.470
Anybody else? It's
such a pretty diamond.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.840
(Tess) You're gonna love it.
You've gotta see it.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.810
Oh. Hey, Simone.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.146
(Anika) See it at the
Hunter House Museum!

03:34.215 --> 03:36.181
Sandwich? What's this all about?

03:36.250 --> 03:40.519
Oh, we're, uh, we're having
an exhibition in the museum.

03:40.588 --> 03:41.720
It's pretty exciting.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.523
If you want, I can give
you a private tour.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.491
Can I talk to Erik and
Kate for a minute?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.895
Uh, they, uh, had to go out.

03:49.964 --> 03:51.496
Um, I can leave them a message.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.731
(Anika) No, wait!

03:52.800 --> 03:54.800
The rarest and fairest
diamond in the world!

03:54.868 --> 03:56.735
Josephine's one true love, everybody!

03:56.804 --> 03:58.570
Anybody!

03:58.639 --> 04:01.139
I just want to make sure they know

04:01.208 --> 04:04.309
they can't organize a big
exhibition without a permit.

04:04.378 --> 04:08.347
Of course they know. Where
do you think they went?

04:08.415 --> 04:12.351
To the... permit office.
To get the permit.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.719
(man) <i>10-44, this is...</i>

04:13.787 --> 04:16.021
Wait, um, I actually want
to ask you something.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.824
Um... would you maybe want to...

04:18.892 --> 04:20.524
<i>All available units respond, please.</i>

04:20.594 --> 04:22.160
Sorry, I need to hear this.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.695
<i>All available units, please
report to Dam Square.</i>

04:23.764 --> 04:25.664
<i>Code 507 in progress.</i>

04:25.733 --> 04:27.733
<i>Altercation between street performers.</i>

04:27.801 --> 04:28.900
Probably another fight

04:28.969 --> 04:29.935
between the jugglers and the mimes.

04:30.004 --> 04:31.670
Why can't they just get along?

04:31.739 --> 04:34.106
Wait, what did you want to ask?

04:34.174 --> 04:35.741
N-nothing, never mind.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.009
Okay.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.212
(sighs)

04:40.281 --> 04:44.683
I was this close to asking her out.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.684
Come on.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.488
You know what you should do?

04:49.556 --> 04:50.989
Get a permit.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.258
That too, but I'm talking about Simone.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.860
So am I.

04:54.928 --> 04:55.894
You should send her something

04:55.963 --> 04:57.696
that let's her know how you feel.

04:57.765 --> 04:58.997
Like what?

04:59.066 --> 05:00.766
Like a love note.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.101
What if she rejects me?

05:03.170 --> 05:05.103
What if she hates love notes?

05:05.172 --> 05:06.638
Everybody likes love notes.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.340
I don't.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.208
Everybody except Tess.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.578
If you're shy, you can
make it esophagus.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.481
She means "anonymous."

05:16.550 --> 05:19.518
Yeah, I could send her
an anonymous text.

05:19.586 --> 05:24.256
Not a text, a letter. On actual paper.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.824
Tell her how you feel

05:25.893 --> 05:28.026
and ask her to meet somewhere romantic.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.295
How'd you become such
an expert in love?

05:30.364 --> 05:32.731
Where do you think? Movies.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.134
Especially Bollywood musicals.
They're so romantic.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.135
Hmm.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.977
(beeping)

05:46.046 --> 05:47.312
We're gonna have to test it.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.547
What for?

05:48.615 --> 05:50.549
Gee, I don't know.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.050
Maybe to see if it works.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.552
Of course it works.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.619
Come on, we still got to set up

05:54.688 --> 05:55.620
all those surveillance cameras.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.055
Can't hurt to test it.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.191
You worry way too much.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.792
Where's the diamond?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.627
Oh, right here in my, uh...

06:05.432 --> 06:06.365
(gasps)

06:07.901 --> 06:09.101
Don't even.

06:09.169 --> 06:14.272
It's fine. I'm sure it's... right here.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.074
Just kidding. Whew!

06:19.513 --> 06:21.179
What? You're carrying around

06:21.248 --> 06:22.848
one of the most valuable objects

06:22.916 --> 06:25.517
in the entire world in your pocket?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.853
So? Pocket's a great
place to keep stuff.

06:27.921 --> 06:28.887
Have I ever lost anything?

06:28.956 --> 06:29.955
Your keys this morning.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.022
Besides my keys this morning.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.124
Your phone yesterday.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.592
Right, that's my point. I lost them

06:33.660 --> 06:35.827
because I didn't...
put 'em in my pocket.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.562
If I did, I'd know
exactly where they were.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.399
Which reminds me, do you
know where my phone is?

06:40.467 --> 06:42.501
(Tess) Max! Sal!

06:42.569 --> 06:44.369
Oh, let's test it.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.974
Wow, the display looks great, you guys.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.177
(alarm sounds)

06:52.246 --> 06:53.779
Now try to escape.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.046
(sighs)

06:56.950 --> 06:58.517
(exhales) Ha ha!

06:58.585 --> 06:59.518
It works!

06:59.586 --> 07:02.020
Let's see Saganash skip that.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.957
(exhales) Beautiful.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.762
(indistinct conversation)

07:20.808 --> 07:23.442
(Tess) How many people you
think are gonna come?

07:23.510 --> 07:24.709
Probably not too many.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.912
We only need one person
to show up, Saganash.

07:26.980 --> 07:27.913
And we will. (telephone rings)

07:27.981 --> 07:29.281
Sooner or later.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.515
Hello.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.983
<i>Hi, this is John Summers,</i>

07:32.052 --> 07:34.286
<i>chief cultural correspondent for GNI.</i>

07:34.354 --> 07:35.987
<i>I'm wondering if I could have a word</i>

07:36.056 --> 07:37.923
<i>with the spokesman of
the Hunter's Museum.</i>

07:37.991 --> 07:39.124
GNI?

07:39.193 --> 07:41.126
<i>Yeah, GNI, Global News International.</i>

07:41.195 --> 07:42.761
<i>I assumed you've heard of us.</i>

07:42.830 --> 07:44.296
<i>I'd like to schedule an interview</i>

07:44.364 --> 07:46.131
<i>with the curator of the new exhibition,</i>

07:46.200 --> 07:47.799
<i>Josephine's One True Love.</i>

07:47.868 --> 07:49.067
Why?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.203
<i>Well, for the story
we're doing, of course.</i>

07:51.271 --> 07:54.339
<i>This is the Hunter House
Museum, isn't it?</i>

07:54.408 --> 07:57.075
I'm gonna have to have
someone get back to you.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.412
Whew! Um, we're gonna have

08:00.481 --> 08:04.416
a few more people than we expected.

08:04.485 --> 08:07.552
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

08:07.621 --> 08:09.888
it's show time.

08:11.758 --> 08:15.093
Josephine's One True Love
is now open to the public!

08:15.162 --> 08:16.595
(cheering)

08:16.663 --> 08:18.163
Yeah, please.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.898
Thank you. Hey, one at a time.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.266
You're gonna enjoy the
diamond, it's great.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.767
It's great. This is a big mistake.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.436
We cannot handle this many people.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.737
The only mistake we made

08:25.806 --> 08:27.372
was not charging more admission, okay?

08:27.441 --> 08:28.373
We'll be rich.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.510
Hey, look at it this way.
The more people,

08:32.578 --> 08:34.578
the more chance Saganash
will be one of them.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.515
He could be here right now.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.017
I really hope Sal's trap works.
It needs to.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.354
Of course it works. My boy's a genius.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.624
Hey.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.792
"Dearest Simone...

08:47.861 --> 08:52.297
"S is for the symptoms of love sickness

08:52.366 --> 08:55.033
"that I feel when I'm with you.

"I is for...

08:59.106 --> 09:02.040
"Indonesian food.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.677
"Why don't we go and get some?

09:05.746 --> 09:10.515
Just us two."

09:15.222 --> 09:16.488
(sighs)

09:16.557 --> 09:17.889
(groaning)

09:23.997 --> 09:25.297
(ding)

09:28.035 --> 09:33.838
"Violets are blue, roses are reddish.

09:33.907 --> 09:40.078
Being with you beats a
trip to the dentist."

09:40.147 --> 09:41.580
It... dentist.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.481
(coughs)

09:43.550 --> 09:47.719
FYI, the exhibition started.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.154
And your girlfriend's downstairs.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.922
Who?

09:50.991 --> 09:52.357
Simone!

09:52.426 --> 09:53.925
Uh, um...

09:53.994 --> 09:55.393
She doesn't look too happy.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.462
That makes two of us.

09:57.531 --> 10:02.734
I can't write this note. I
have no idea what to say.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.436
Let's have a look.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.741
Have a look.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.814
Wow, Tess. You're phenomenal.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.149
(horns honking)

10:18.218 --> 10:20.819
Okay, people, you're blocking traffic.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.053
You're standing in the
middle of the street.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.555
Keep it moving. Thank you.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.824
Do you want to get hit by a car?
Come on.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.059
Yes, thank you. Perfect.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.562
Okay. Yes.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.397
Simone.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.200
Is this what you call having
everything under control?

10:35.268 --> 10:38.570
Sorry, it's a little more
popular than we expected.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.606
Don't tell me. Your parents
still aren't around?

10:41.675 --> 10:42.941
Uh, they're around.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.011
They just had to go... to the bank.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.613
Have them call me ASAP, understand?

10:48.682 --> 10:50.849
You got it, ASAP. (horn honks)

10:52.986 --> 10:54.285
Are you okay?

10:54.354 --> 10:55.920
Yes, my darling.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.689
I just want to know if
there's a reduced price

10:57.758 --> 10:59.124
for the elderly citizens.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.359
Oh, I really don't know.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.927
The best thing you can do right now

11:02.996 --> 11:05.263
is to get back in the
line for your own safety.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.399
Okay. Thank you.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.702
Remember, have them call me, okay?

11:15.742 --> 11:17.142
(camera clicking) Hey!

11:17.210 --> 11:20.245
Come on! You can't stop there.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.080
Don't worry. It's not gonna take long.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.382
The diamond is beautiful.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.252
I did it. I gave her the letter.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.453
What'd she say?

11:28.522 --> 11:33.391
She sort of doesn't
know I gave it to her.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.793
Anyway, never mind.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.163
How's it going? Any
sign of, uh, Saganash?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.699
I don't know. I don't
know what he looks like.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.333
Still think we're taking a big risk

11:42.402 --> 11:43.868
drawing this crowd here.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.603
A risk we have to take.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.906
Hey, guys. Have you seen Jean Louise?

11:47.974 --> 11:51.242
Who? Jean Louise.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.577
You lost her? Yeah.

11:52.646 --> 11:55.113
She better find that beast.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.516
Beast? Beast?

11:58.585 --> 12:00.085
I'm gonna go check on Sal.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.389
(sighs)

12:08.361 --> 12:09.928
Hey, how's it going?

12:09.996 --> 12:10.962
Great.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.397
I've got coverage of every angle.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.032
Perfect.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.035
<i>I just want this not here.
Go the other way.</i>

12:17.104 --> 12:18.036
If Saganash beats the trap,

12:18.105 --> 12:19.304
at least we'll have it on video.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.473
What do you mean, beats the trap?

12:21.541 --> 12:23.742
It's not gonna happen, just a backup.

12:23.810 --> 12:28.646
A little extra insurance
so nothing can go wrong.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.648
Something just went wrong.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.291
Clutterbeak. What is she doing here?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.994
Go check it out.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.531
Thank you for coming.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.166
Thank you, it's gonna be
a great show, thank you.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.268
Mrs. Clutterbeak.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.772
Julius, Janine. This is a surprise.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.441
Yes, well, I heard about the exhibition

12:56.510 --> 12:59.110
and decided to take some
of my favorite students

12:59.179 --> 13:00.879
on a special field trip.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.348
On a weekend. Lucky you.

13:03.416 --> 13:07.552
Yeah. Precious gems are one of
my many areas of expertise.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.322
Right, along with child torture.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.590
What's that?

13:12.659 --> 13:17.662
Oh, I said, uh, along
with child teaching.

13:17.731 --> 13:22.267
Ah. So... where is this diamond?

13:22.335 --> 13:25.203
<i>Well, you don't expect us
to wait in line, do you?</i>

13:25.272 --> 13:27.505
<i>We deserve VIP treatment.</i>

13:27.574 --> 13:29.574
It moves pretty fast.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.708
It'll only be like a
couple minutes really.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.744
Oh, well, it...

13:32.813 --> 13:35.947
it would be unfortunate
if my experience here

13:36.016 --> 13:40.852
were to somehow have a negative
effect on your grades.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.321
I didn't know a grade
could go lower than F.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.891
<i>That's true. Yours can't get any lower.</i>

13:46.960 --> 13:50.028
But what about your brother Sal?

13:50.096 --> 13:52.263
<i>I would hate to see something happen</i>

13:52.332 --> 13:56.901
to his nice, shiny A.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.106
I'm sure we can accommodate you.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.341
Right this way.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.014
<i>Thank you. Keep it moving. Yep.</i>

14:10.083 --> 14:11.382
<i>Okay, perfect.</i>

14:11.451 --> 14:14.118
(horn honking) Yes, finally.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.653
Thank you for waiting.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.627
Hey, Tim.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.862
Pretty crazy, huh?

14:23.930 --> 14:25.263
Seriously. What's going on?

14:25.332 --> 14:27.932
Don't even ask.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.267
Have you seen Erik or Kate?

14:29.336 --> 14:31.569
Uh-huh. Daniel said they had
to run out to the bank.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.805
I'd sure like a word with them.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.506
Mm.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.676
I should get going.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.545
But give me a call.

14:40.614 --> 14:42.413
If there's anything I need to know.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.414
Yeah. Okay.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.649
Gotcha.

14:44.718 --> 14:48.953
Well, I... will see you soon,

14:49.022 --> 14:49.988
I hope.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.023
I mean, I guess. I guess.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.828
See ya.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.329
Careful.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.765
Yeah, you too.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.345
(Simone) "When midnight tolls,
we'll fall for each other.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.115
"I'll be in front of the Hunter
House on the water below.

15:17.183 --> 15:20.151
Will I see your
reflection beside mine?"

15:26.793 --> 15:28.593
(cell phone chiming)

15:31.898 --> 15:34.332
Yes! Whoo!

15:34.401 --> 15:38.169
♪♪

15:56.256 --> 15:57.689
(groaning)

15:57.757 --> 15:58.957
I can hardly see it.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.125
Why do we have to stand so far away?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.127
Security measures... ma'am.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.163
It's ridiculous! (Tess) Please stay

16:05.231 --> 16:07.065
<i>behind the rope, Miss Clutterbeak.</i>

16:07.133 --> 16:09.133
I have paid to see this diamond

16:09.202 --> 16:11.903
and now I want to be
able to really see it.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.906
Please, it's museum policy.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.841
Step back.

16:16.910 --> 16:21.546
I have never been treated so shabbily.

16:21.614 --> 16:22.981
Where are your parents?!

16:23.049 --> 16:26.184
I would like to speak
to them this instant!

16:26.252 --> 16:27.418
We'll put them in touch with you

16:27.487 --> 16:30.021
during regular business hours.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.357
I knew it. There's always been

16:32.425 --> 16:34.125
something wrong with this family.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.928
But I won't take it. I'm
going to the police

16:36.997 --> 16:38.563
right now to report this...

16:38.631 --> 16:41.466
...scam! (groaning)

16:41.534 --> 16:43.501
The diamond's the size of a walnut.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.803
Ha! The size of a pea, I mean.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.172
Aah! What is that?!

16:48.241 --> 16:50.541
Get a grip. That's just a chameleon.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.909
(screaming)

16:51.978 --> 16:53.845
Settle down a minute!

16:53.913 --> 16:55.680
(people clamoring)

16:55.749 --> 16:58.249
Have you never seen a
harmless reptile before?

16:58.318 --> 16:59.250
Oh!

16:59.319 --> 17:05.857
(people screaming)

17:05.925 --> 17:08.425
(Miss Clutterbeak) Yes, thank you.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.034
(Tess) This was a bad idea.

17:16.102 --> 17:19.103
Well, I mean, it depends
what you mean by "bad."

17:19.172 --> 17:22.540
I mean, sure, a riot
did break out and...

17:22.608 --> 17:25.042
the law is breathing down our necks.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.478
The Clutterbeak problem
isn't going away.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.048
That's kind of what I mean by bad.

17:30.116 --> 17:34.952
Yeah. But hey, look at the
attention we got, right?

17:35.021 --> 17:37.288
Saganash has got to know we
have the diamond by now.

17:37.357 --> 17:41.159
Yeah, but he didn't show up.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.628
Yeah, because he's not an idiot.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.897
I mean, he's not gonna show
up when everyone's here.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.499
But he will. Eventually.

17:48.568 --> 17:49.901
He has to.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.336
Maybe he'll come tonight.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.138
I'd bet on it.

17:54.207 --> 17:57.141
I mean, the trap is still set.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.113
Whoo!

18:04.284 --> 18:06.784
What's up, Simone?

18:21.301 --> 18:22.400
(clanking)

18:36.316 --> 18:38.249
(creaking)

18:50.463 --> 18:54.899
It's probably nothing. I'm off duty.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.555
(beeping)

19:17.624 --> 19:20.725
(alarm sounds)

19:20.793 --> 19:21.993
(grunting)

19:23.863 --> 19:25.463
Hope you got a good lawyer, Saganash.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.499
Aha!

19:28.568 --> 19:30.101
Do I look like Saganash?

19:30.170 --> 19:32.336
Daniel? Simone?

19:32.405 --> 19:34.305
Daniel?

19:34.374 --> 19:37.975
Hi, Simone.

19:38.044 --> 19:41.179
Who is Saganash and
what's going on here?

19:41.247 --> 19:42.580
Uh, nothing.

19:42.649 --> 19:43.848
We were just playing a
game of hide and seek.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.416
Yeah. There you are. Now it's over.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.417
Ready to go to sleep

19:46.486 --> 19:47.418
'cause we're really tired, so...

19:47.487 --> 19:49.587
Yeah.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.556
I don't know what this is all about,

19:51.624 --> 19:55.626
but I'm gonna find out
first thing tomorrow.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.529
I have a date with Tim and I'm late.

19:58.598 --> 20:03.234
Wait, you have two midnight dates?

20:03.303 --> 20:06.103
Two dates? What are you talking about?

20:06.172 --> 20:08.206
Nothing.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.110
Sorry, man.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.780
(Sal) I think we got him.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.889
Wha...?

20:24.958 --> 20:27.124
No one can escape this room.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.926
Who set off the alarm?

20:28.995 --> 20:32.430
Jean Louise, there you are.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.433
Come here. You okay?

20:35.501 --> 20:37.301
You're such a little troublemaker.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.904
(groans)

20:39.973 --> 20:42.607
You okay? Yeah.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.608
(beeping)

20:55.955 --> 20:58.723
(alarm)

21:00.994 --> 21:02.627
(laughter)

21:06.699 --> 21:08.899
(Daniel) This is just great.

21:08.968 --> 21:09.900
Everything's ruined all because of

21:09.969 --> 21:11.669
some stupid alligator.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.437
She's a chameleon.

21:13.506 --> 21:14.739
Okay. Whatever.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.141
Yeah, but you're insulting her.

21:24.584 --> 21:29.520
<i>You fools thought you could
trap me like a household pest.</i>

21:29.589 --> 21:33.157
<i>I have just one thing to say to you.</i>

21:33.226 --> 21:37.328
<i>If you want to see
your parents again...</i>

21:37.397 --> 21:41.599
<i>you give me the diamond.</i>
