10:52.333 --> 10:54.291
(Larry)
YEAH, ALREADY.

10:54.291 --> 10:55.500
THAT'S GOOD.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.667
YOU HEADED BACK
TO YOUR PLACE?

10:56.667 --> 10:57.959
I AM, I AM.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.792
(Louis)

10:59.792 --> 11:01.709
YEAH, WE'LL TALK LATER.

11:11.667 --> 11:12.917

IT'S ALL RIGHT.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.250
I DON'T BITE.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.750
COME ON.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.792
HEY, YOU HUNGRY?

11:22.792 --> 11:24.166
I GOT FOOD.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.333
HUH?

11:25.333 --> 11:28.125
YOU THIRSTY?

11:28.125 --> 11:28.959
I WANT A SODA.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.250
YOU WANT A SODA?
I'M OUT OF SODA.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.667
WANT A WATER?

11:31.667 --> 11:33.792
HUH? HEY,
YOU WANT A WATER?

11:33.792 --> 11:35.750
I'LL GET YOU A WATER.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.583
ALL RIGHT. HOW IS THAT?

11:42.583 --> 11:43.875
GOOD?

11:51.250 --> 11:52.375
I WANNA GO HOME.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.208
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT TO
STAY HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT.

12:00.959 --> 12:01.583
NO, I WANNA GO HOME.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.875
NO, WE GOT TO STAY HERE.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.417
CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NOW.

12:05.417 --> 12:08.750
SO MAYBE YOU WANNA
WATCH T.V. OR CARTOONS?

12:08.750 --> 12:10.375
I WANNA GO HOME.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.250
WE GOT TO STAY HERE.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.208
NO.

12:15.208 --> 12:18.583
- BRIAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
- TAKE ME HOME NOW.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.083

- HEY!

12:20.083 --> 12:21.417
FUCK ALL OF YOU!
YOU STUPID SOUP-FUCKER!

12:21.417 --> 12:22.709
WHAT?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.417
DON'T DO THAT,
MOTHERFUCKER!

12:24.417 --> 12:25.834
BRIAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
CUT THAT OUT.

12:25.834 --> 12:29.041
CUT IT OUT! STOP! STOP!
BE QUIET!

12:29.041 --> 12:30.834
- I'M GOIN' TO THE BAYWATCH.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.917
- I'M GOIN' TO THE BAYWATCH.
- HEY!

12:32.917 --> 12:36.583
I'M GOIN' TO THE BAYWATCH.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.333
ALL RIGHT.

12:41.583 --> 12:42.667
[burps]

12:42.667 --> 12:43.166
WHERE ARE MY SEEDS?

12:43.166 --> 12:45.166
HUH?

12:45.166 --> 12:47.709
THEY'RE
SUNFLOWER SEEDS, IDIOT.

12:47.709 --> 12:49.500
- THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.
- THEY'RE SUNFLOWER SEEDS!

12:49.500 --> 12:51.917
OK, THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.125
- THEY'RE SUNFLOWER SEEDS!
- BEHIND YOU.

12:53.125 --> 12:54.583
THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.083
RIGHT THERE.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.875
OK.

13:01.417 --> 13:05.333
[doorbell ringing]

13:05.333 --> 13:07.417
STAY HERE.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.500
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.375
JUST KIDDIN' AROUND.

13:23.458 --> 13:25.125
HELLO.

13:25.125 --> 13:25.917
HI.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.000
MAY I BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE?

13:31.125 --> 13:33.083
WELL, THAT REMAINS
TO BE SEEN.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.709
- [chuckling]
- LOOK, I'M--

13:34.709 --> 13:36.250
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
IT'S JUST, UH...

13:36.250 --> 13:38.333
I WAS WONDERING
IF IT WOULDN'T BE

13:38.333 --> 13:40.208
TOO MUCH TROUBLE IF
I COULD USE YOUR PHONE
FOR A SECOND.

13:40.208 --> 13:41.959
- THAT'S-- I, UH...
- RIGHT.

13:41.959 --> 13:44.166
I JUST TOOK
A ONE-BEDROOM IN THE FRONT,

13:44.166 --> 13:45.291
AND I'VE BEEN WAITIN' ALL DAY

13:45.291 --> 13:48.041
FOR THE PHONE COMPANY
TO COME HOOK ME UP, BUT...

13:48.041 --> 13:50.000
YEAH, IT'S JUST KIND
OF A BAD...

13:50.000 --> 13:52.291
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND,
I PROMISE.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.959
YOU KNOW,
IT'S PROBABLY A LOCAL CALL.

13:55.959 --> 13:57.041
I CAN'T.
I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW.

13:57.041 --> 13:59.500
I'LL BE IN AND OUT
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.542
I PROMISE.

14:01.542 --> 14:04.125
JUST LEAVE A FAINT SCENT.

14:05.291 --> 14:07.834
[sighs]

14:07.834 --> 14:10.834
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
COME ON IN.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.500
THANK YOU.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.500
SURE.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.834
IT'S, UH...
THE PHONE'S
RIGHT THERE.

14:17.834 --> 14:18.500
I PROMISE
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.166
ALL RIGHT.

14:23.834 --> 14:25.250
AHEM.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.875
HELLO.

14:39.834 --> 14:42.291
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
GO SIT DOWN.
GO IN THE KITCHEN.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.458
THESE COMPUTER
ANSWERING THINGS,

14:45.458 --> 14:47.375
THEY DRIVE ME NUTS.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.291
YOU'RE MAKIN'
A TELEPHONE CALL.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.208
THAT'S RIGHT,
SHE'S MAKIN'
A TELEPHONE CALL.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.542
DON'T CALL BAYWATCH
BECAUSE THEY'RE CLOSED TODAY.

14:52.542 --> 14:53.625
[chuckling]

14:53.625 --> 14:56.166
I WOULDN'T THINK OF IT.

15:12.625 --> 15:14.542
I'M SORRY, I GOT TO ASK.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.959
DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER?

15:17.709 --> 15:19.458
NOT YET.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.417
I'M RICKI.

15:23.417 --> 15:26.542
LARRY.

15:26.542 --> 15:27.792
LARRY GIGGLY, RIGHT?

15:27.792 --> 15:30.417
I SAW IT ON THE MAILBOX.

15:30.417 --> 15:33.750
YEAH, IT'S PRONOUNCED
"ZHEE-LEE," LIKE, UH...

15:33.750 --> 15:35.583
RHYMES WITH "REALLY."

15:35.583 --> 15:38.166
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,
LARRY GIGLI.

15:38.166 --> 15:38.583
NICE TO MEET YOU, LARRY.

15:38.583 --> 15:39.667
[chuckling]

15:39.667 --> 15:42.208
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

15:43.917 --> 15:45.291
BOB.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.792
YOU'RE STUPID.
THAT'S NOT MY NAME.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.125
THAT'S NOT YOUR NAME?

15:48.125 --> 15:49.500
WHAT IS YOUR NAME, SWEETIE?

15:49.500 --> 15:50.834
THAT'S IT.
HIS NAME'S BOB.

15:50.834 --> 15:51.917
HIS NAME'S NOT BOB.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.250
YOUR NAME IS BOB.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.291
WELL, WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS,

15:55.291 --> 15:58.166
HAS ANYONE
EVER TOLD YOU YOU'RE
A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.125
CAN I TALK TO
YOU FOR A MINUTE?

16:16.625 --> 16:18.125
SURE.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.208
IN PRIVATE.

16:30.834 --> 16:31.875
I CAN'T FUCKIN'
BELIEVE THIS.

16:31.875 --> 16:34.208
IT'S AN UNEXPECTED BONUS.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.959
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT
YOU WERE A BABE MAGNET?

16:35.959 --> 16:37.500
YOU'RE BETTER THAN
A FUCKIN' DOG.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.500
YOU'RE A DOG,
YOU DOG-HEAD PISS-FART!

16:38.500 --> 16:40.208
OH, WHATEVER.

16:52.750 --> 16:56.250
YOU KNOW,
I HEARD YOU WERE
A BIT OF A FUCK-UP.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.375
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I'M FRANKLY AMAZED

16:58.375 --> 17:02.375
AT HOW MUCH OF A FUCK-UP
YOU ACTUALLY ARE.

17:02.375 --> 17:03.000
AM I MISSIN' SOMETHING HERE?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.290
WELL, IT WOULD SEEM SO.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.165
BUT YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU CALL LOUIS

17:06.165 --> 17:08.208
AND HE'LL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING TO YOU.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.250
UH, I, UH...

17:12.250 --> 17:15.125
I DON'T KNOW THAT
I KNOW ANY LOUIS.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.208
WELL, THEN I GUESS
HE HASN'T CALLED YOU

17:17.208 --> 17:18.875
TO TELL YOU HE
DOESN'T TRUST YOU

17:18.875 --> 17:21.333
WITH A TASK
OF THIS MAGNITUDE.

17:21.333 --> 17:24.125
THAT HE FEELS
THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.375
- NOPE.
- "NOPE."

17:26.375 --> 17:29.000
WELL, THEN I GUESS HE ALSO
PROBABLY HASN'T CALLED
TO TELL YOU

17:29.000 --> 17:33.041
THAT HE'D FEEL MUCH MORE
COMFORTABLE IF THERE WERE
TWO INDEPENDENT, UNACQUAINTED,

17:33.041 --> 17:36.125
PERHAPS EVEN MUTUALLY HOSTILE
CONTRACTORS WORKING ON THIS,

17:36.125 --> 17:39.458
SO THEY COULD KEEP
AN EYE ON ONE ANOTHER?

17:39.458 --> 17:40.750
NOPE.

17:40.750 --> 17:43.291
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO TAKE MY WORD

17:43.291 --> 17:45.625
FOR PRECISELY
HOW SECOND-RATE
HE CONSIDERS YOU.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.041
IT'D PROBABLY MAKE
BOTH OUR LIVES A LOT EASIER

17:47.041 --> 17:50.458
IF YOU JUST HEARD IT
DIRECTLY FROM HIM.

17:52.792 --> 17:54.333
[phone ringing]

17:54.333 --> 17:56.875
THAT'S GOOD STUFF.
I HAD THAT TODAY.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.792
EXCUSE ME ONE MINUTE.

17:58.792 --> 17:59.375
SURE.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.208
LOUIS, YOU THERE?

18:05.208 --> 18:07.959
I'M HERE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

18:07.959 --> 18:10.417
YEAH, THERE'S THIS, UH,

18:10.417 --> 18:12.792
YOUNG LADY HERE
TRYING TO TELL ME THAT--

18:12.792 --> 18:14.667
ALL RIGHT,
THIS THING IS MONUMENTAL, OK?

18:14.667 --> 18:15.959
CERTAINLY TOO BIG
FOR A JERK-OFF LIKE YOURSELF,

18:15.959 --> 18:18.583
BUT TODAY, I HAD NO CHOICE.

18:18.583 --> 18:21.250
(Louis)
THIS THING REPRESENTS
MY ASS AND MY FUTURE.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.291
I WANT YOU TO WORK
WITH HER AND I WANT YOU

18:23.291 --> 18:25.959
TO WATCH HER AS SHE
WILL BE WATCHING YOU.

18:25.959 --> 18:27.875
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

18:27.875 --> 18:29.166
THAT I WILL
PERSONALLY EXCORIATE
ANYONE RESPONSIBLE

18:29.166 --> 18:32.250
FOR THE TINIEST
FUCK-UP IN THIS ACTION.

18:32.250 --> 18:34.041
AND I WANT YOU TO
UNDERSTAND THAT.

18:34.041 --> 18:36.250
YES, LOUIS.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.792
"YES, LOUIS"?

18:38.792 --> 18:41.083
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHAT "EXCORIATE" MEANS?

18:41.083 --> 18:42.500
UH...

18:42.500 --> 18:44.250
IT'S NOT COMIN' TO ME
AT THE MOMENT.

18:44.250 --> 18:48.542
IT MEANS "TO STRIP
OR WEAR OFF THE SKIN OF,

18:48.542 --> 18:49.709
TO FLAY."

18:49.709 --> 18:51.583
NOW, I'M LEARNING
A WORD A DAY.

18:51.583 --> 18:53.792
AND IT'S CRITICAL TO USE
THESE WORDS IN CONVERSATION,

18:53.792 --> 18:55.583
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I USED IT
IN THIS CONVERSATION.

18:55.583 --> 18:59.959
IN THIS CONVERSATION
I USED IT BECAUSE I MEANT IT.

18:59.959 --> 19:03.208
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'LL BE GOING NOW.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.375
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

19:06.375 --> 19:07.625
YEAH,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.792
OK.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.458
NOW DON'T GET
YOURSELF ALL TIED
IN A KNOT.

19:14.458 --> 19:15.917
OK? I DON'T KNOW
THIS GUY,

19:15.917 --> 19:17.625
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW ME.

19:17.625 --> 19:20.458
BUT MY REPUTATION
APPARENTLY IS PRETTY SOLID.

19:20.458 --> 19:24.125
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET YOURSELF STRAIGHT,

19:24.125 --> 19:26.625
AND WE CAN PUT THIS
WHOLE THING BEHIND US.

19:26.625 --> 19:30.458
AND IF YOU HAVE ANY
DECAFFEINATED OR HERBAL TEA,

19:30.458 --> 19:32.458
I WOULD REALLY BE
MOST APPRECIATIVE.

19:32.458 --> 19:34.834
- I WANT TEA.
- TWO TEAS.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.458
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN',
OK?

19:37.458 --> 19:40.583
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK
YOU THINK YOU ARE,

19:40.583 --> 19:41.709
BUT I DON'T WORK
LIKE THIS.

19:41.709 --> 19:43.291
YOU GOT THAT?

19:43.291 --> 19:45.333
IF YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT REPUTATIONS,

19:45.333 --> 19:48.083
AND IF BY SOME
FUCKIN' MIRACLE LONG SHOT

19:48.083 --> 19:50.208
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
OF MY REPUTATION,

19:50.208 --> 19:51.291
LET ME TELL YOU
WHO THE FUCK I AM.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.709
I AM THE FUCKIN'
SULTAN OF SLICK, SADIE.

19:54.709 --> 19:56.375
I AM THE RULE
OF FUCKIN' COOL.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.583
YOU WANNA BE A GANGSTER?
YOU WANNA BE A THUG?

19:59.583 --> 20:01.333
YOU SIT AT MY FUCKIN' FEET.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.291
GATHER THE PEARLS
THAT EMANATE FORTH FROM ME.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.125
BECAUSE I'M
THE FUCKIN' ORIGINAL,

20:05.125 --> 20:08.291
STRAIGHT-FIRST-FOREMOST,
PIMP-MACK

20:08.291 --> 20:13.166
FUCKIN' HUSTLER,
ORIGINAL GANGSTER'S GANGSTER.

20:16.083 --> 20:17.917
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT,

20:17.917 --> 20:20.208
BUT I'M GONNA GO
AND GET MY STUFF.

20:22.041 --> 20:25.834
AND DON'T YOU WORRY
YOUR LITTLE GANGSTER'S
GANGSTER HEAD ABOUT IT,

20:25.834 --> 20:26.834
I CAN MANAGE.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.208
[door closing]

20:28.208 --> 20:30.709
HOW MANY CUPS
OF YOUR OWN SPIT

20:30.709 --> 20:32.625
DO YOU THINK YOU
SWALLOW EVERY DAY, LARRY?

20:34.959 --> 20:37.625
I THINK ABOUT 35 CUPS.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.333
WOULD YOU JUST
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

20:39.333 --> 20:40.583
YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

20:42.417 --> 20:44.542
- WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?
- NO, YOU!

20:44.542 --> 20:46.166
WHAT, YOU JUST GO IN AND OUT,
RIGHT?

20:46.166 --> 20:47.625
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.291
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

20:49.291 --> 20:51.625
YOU'RE THE FUCK,
YOU STUPID DUCK-FUCK.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.417
WHY DON'T YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND JUST ACT FUCKIN'
NORMAL FOR A MINUTE.

20:54.417 --> 20:56.375
- LOOKS LIKE--
- JUST FOR A MINUTE.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.792
YOU'LL END UP WITH
ELLIOT OVER THERE.

20:58.792 --> 21:01.542
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.
JUST FUCKIN' BE NORMAL, OK.

21:01.542 --> 21:02.750
I'M TELLING YOU--

21:02.750 --> 21:04.583
NOT FUCKIN' CRAZY! NORMAL!

21:04.583 --> 21:06.375
HOW ABOUT IF I SMACK YOU
IN THE FUCKIN' HEAD, HUH?

21:06.375 --> 21:08.625
- HEY! LEAVE HIM ALONE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

21:08.625 --> 21:11.333
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WATCH HIM,
NOT SLAP HIM AROUND.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.542
DON'T TELL ME WHAT

THIS MAY BE A GOOD TIME
TO SUGGEST

30:19.291 --> 30:23.458
THAT YOU NOT ALLOW
THE SEEDS OF CRUEL HOPE
TO SPROUT IN YOUR SOUL.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.041
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

30:26.041 --> 30:27.750
BUT IT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.

30:27.750 --> 30:31.291
IT MEANS
YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.

30:32.375 --> 30:34.750
IS THAT RIGHT?

30:36.875 --> 30:40.166
WHAT ABOUT ME
IS NOT YOUR TYPE?

30:43.834 --> 30:45.375
YOUR PENIS.

30:45.959 --> 30:48.166
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

30:49.709 --> 30:51.542
IT MEANS I'M GAY.

30:51.542 --> 30:55.000
IT MEANS I'M A LESBIAN.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.166
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU,
IF I WASN'T...

31:01.166 --> 31:02.834
I MEAN, AFTER A FIRST DATE
LIKE THIS,

31:02.834 --> 31:05.250
I'D FIND IT REALLY HARD

33:38.041 --> 33:38.500
[pounding on door]

33:38.500 --> 33:41.041
WHAT?

33:41.041 --> 33:42.125
YOUR DOOR'S NOT
THICK ENOUGH TO PRETEND

33:42.125 --> 33:44.667
YOU'RE NOT HOME
WHEN YOU'RE HOME.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.125
WHAT'S UP?

33:46.125 --> 33:47.667
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

33:47.667 --> 33:48.750
[door closing]

33:48.750 --> 33:50.667
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

33:50.667 --> 33:51.625
JUST FINE. YOURSELF?

33:51.625 --> 33:54.166
JUST FINE.

33:54.166 --> 33:58.250
I'M SEARCHING FOR NEWS
ON THE UNDERGROUND.

34:00.125 --> 34:03.542
MIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT
IT IS I'M GETTING AT?

34:03.542 --> 34:04.709
NO.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.542
NO. WELL...

34:06.542 --> 34:09.708
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
MYSTERIOUS CASES.

34:09.708 --> 34:13.250
UNSOLVABLE. PROBABLY TURN OUT
TO BE AN ALIEN ABDUCTION,

34:13.250 --> 34:14.458
BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE OBLIGATED

34:14.458 --> 34:17.583
TO AT LEAST CREATE
THE APPEARANCE
OF DUE DILIGENCE.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.500
WHAT?

34:19.500 --> 34:20.833
I DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'.

34:20.833 --> 34:22.375
OH YEAH.

34:22.375 --> 34:25.417

34:25.417 --> 34:27.333
LOUIS,

34:27.333 --> 34:29.667
HIS SUPERVISOR BACK
IN THE HOME OFFICE

34:29.667 --> 34:31.542
IS ABOUT TO FOLD
HIS NAPKIN, RIGHT?

34:31.542 --> 34:32.750
SORRY?

34:32.750 --> 34:36.041
STARKMAN, IN NEW YORK.

34:36.041 --> 34:37.041
HE'S THROUGH.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.166
LOOKING AT HUGE FEDERAL TIME.

34:39.166 --> 34:42.041
BIG, UGLY,
DARK DUNGEON UNDERGROUND.

34:42.041 --> 34:44.458
NO CHANCE OF PAROLE,
NEVER EVER.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.083
TIME.

34:50.375 --> 34:52.875
YEP. I'M SORRY TO SAY.

34:52.875 --> 34:56.625
I HEAR HE'S A GOOD GUY,
BUT, YOU KNOW...

34:56.625 --> 34:58.834
IN ANY EVENT,
HERE'S MY PROBLEM,

34:58.834 --> 35:00.083
AND IF YOU KNOW ANY OF THIS,

35:00.083 --> 35:02.041
FEEL FREE, JUMP IN,
SHUT ME UP.

35:02.041 --> 35:06.417
THIS FEDERAL
PROSECUTOR OUT HERE,

35:06.417 --> 35:10.583
THE ONE WITH
STARKMAN'S TESTICULAR MATTER
CLUTCHED IN HIS FIST,

35:10.583 --> 35:14.458
THIS VERY
FEDERAL PROSECUTOR'S
LITTLE BROTHER...

35:14.458 --> 35:16.750
ANY OF THIS SOUND FAMILIAR?

35:16.750 --> 35:18.750
TO ME? NO.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.458
NO. WELL...

35:21.458 --> 35:23.583
THIS VERY FEDERAL
PROSECUTOR'S
LITTLE BROTHER,

35:23.583 --> 35:25.834
A BIT DOPEY
FROM WHAT I GATHER,

35:25.834 --> 35:28.125
MAY HAVE BEEN ABSCONDED WITH,

35:28.125 --> 35:30.542
WHICH, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
WOULD BE

35:30.542 --> 35:33.500
TO THE DISMAY
OF OUR PROSECUTOR.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.041
I THINK...

35:38.041 --> 35:40.083
BUT I COULD BE WRONG
ABOUT THIS,

35:40.083 --> 35:42.333
BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST
TOO STUPID FOR A MIND
TO GRASP.

35:42.333 --> 35:45.000
BUT I THINK MAYBE SOMEONE

35:45.000 --> 35:48.792
IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL
COMMUNITY

35:48.792 --> 35:51.917
MIGHT BE PARTICIPATING
IN THESE SHENANIGANS

35:51.917 --> 35:54.750
TO, I DON'T KNOW,

35:54.750 --> 35:57.917
HELP SQUEEZE
A LITTLE FRIENDSHIP,

35:57.917 --> 36:00.166
ALTRUISM, WHATEVER,

36:00.166 --> 36:01.208
OUT OF THIS PARTICULAR
FEDERAL OFFICIAL.

36:01.208 --> 36:04.792
MAYBE IN THE HOPES
THAT STARKMAN

36:04.792 --> 36:07.959
WILL WAKE UP

36:07.959 --> 36:10.333
ONE MORNING...

36:13.208 --> 36:17.375
WAKE UP ONE MORNING
TO FIND ALL CHARGES
MYSTERIOUSLY DROPPED.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.458
THE SCHOOL OF
THOUGHT AMONGST MY COLLEAGUES

36:19.458 --> 36:22.250
IS THAT THIS KID IS
ALREADY WAY OUT OF TOWN.

36:22.250 --> 36:24.667
I ALONE AM OF
THE OPPOSITE SCHOOL.

36:24.667 --> 36:26.333
I THINK HE'S STILL HERE.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

36:26.333 --> 36:29.041
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS WHAT YOU THINK.

36:29.041 --> 36:30.709
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

36:30.709 --> 36:32.834
AS A FRIEND WHO'S GOT
HIS EAR TO THE STREET.

36:32.834 --> 36:34.542
SERIOUSLY.

36:36.083 --> 36:39.000
- I NEVER... YOU KNOW--
- I KNOW.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.667
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHIN'.

36:41.667 --> 36:45.166
I CAN TELL JUST BY
LOOKIN' AT YOU.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.834
THE WHOLE THING'S PROBABLY
ALIEN ABDUCTION,

36:53.834 --> 36:55.375
LIKE I SAID BEFORE.

36:59.750 --> 37:03.667
MAN, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'D LOVE TO DO

37:03.667 --> 37:04.333
RIGHT NOW?

37:11.458 --> 37:14.041
GO DOWN
TO MARIE CALLENDER'S,

37:14.041 --> 37:18.083
GET ME A BIG BOWL,
PIE, SOME ICE CREAM ON IT.

37:18.083 --> 37:19.208
MMM-HMM.

37:19.208 --> 37:20.709
GOOD.

37:20.709 --> 37:22.041
PUT SOME ON YOUR HEAD,

37:22.041 --> 37:26.875
YOUR TONGUE WOULD
SLAP YOUR BRAINS OUT
TRYING TO GET TO IT.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.625
INTERESTED?

37:28.625 --> 37:31.583
SURE?

37:31.583 --> 37:33.542
YEAH, I'M TRYING TO
GET IN SHAPE, YOU KNOW.

37:58.083 --> 38:00.667
LOOK,

38:00.667 --> 38:03.417
THANKS FOR THE HOSPITALITY.

38:03.417 --> 38:05.208
IT CAN'T BE
THE MOST PLEASANT THING

38:05.208 --> 38:08.125
TO HAVE YOUR PRIVACY
BE INTRUDED ON.

38:08.125 --> 38:10.750
MAYBE IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING,
YOU'LL LET ME KNOW?

38:12.750 --> 38:16.333
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
IF I HEAR ANYTHING.

38:21.625 --> 38:22.417
YEAH, I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

38:42.959 --> 38:44.625
- ALL RIGHT.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.125
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
I TOLD YOU TO...

38:59.125 --> 39:02.333
- I'M HUNGRY.
- WE GOT NOTHIN' TO EAT.

39:02.333 --> 39:03.166
I'M HUNGRY, THOUGH.

ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF?

39:20.291 --> 39:21.792
NO, NOT ALL OF IT.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.417
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CHECK INTO A HOTEL.

39:23.417 --> 39:25.458
FUCK THAT. I LIVE HERE.
THIS IS MY PLACE.

39:25.458 --> 39:28.333
NO ONE'S GETTIN' ME
OUT OF MY PLACE.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.417

39:30.417 --> 39:32.875
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST
FUCKIN' FIVE TIMES, BRIAN.

39:59.291 --> 40:02.000

IS CLOSED TODAY. AGAIN.

40:15.125 --> 40:17.166

40:17.166 --> 40:20.125
THEY--THEY SAID THEY'RE
WORKIN' ON THE PROBLEM,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

THEY DON'T KNOW HOW
LONG IT'S GONNA BE.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.667

40:26.583 --> 40:29.375
IT'S WHERE
ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS ARE.

40:29.375 --> 40:31.083
THEY SWIM.

40:31.083 --> 40:33.333
THEY SWIM THERE.

40:33.333 --> 40:35.291
YOU'RE TALKIN'
ABOUT THE T.V. SHOW?

40:35.291 --> 40:38.875
NO, YOU--
NOT T.V. THAT'S T.V.

40:38.875 --> 40:41.625

WHERE THEY REALLY ARE.

40:41.625 --> 40:44.375
THEY'RE REALLY THERE.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.667

FRIENDS THERE.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.083

THE SEX IS.

THE HIGHEST

45:10.500 --> 45:14.083
YOU SAID BACK THERE
WITH THE--THE EYE AND THAT?

45:14.083 --> 45:16.750
NO.

45:16.750 --> 45:19.750
THAT WAS ALL BULLSHIT, HUH?

45:20.208 --> 45:22.250
YEP.

45:23.542 --> 45:26.166
SUN TZU SAID THAT, IN A WAR,

45:26.166 --> 45:29.375
THE BEST VICTORY
IS THAT WHICH
REQUIRES NO BATTLE.

45:29.375 --> 45:32.083
IS THIS SOME MORE
BULLSHIT NOW I'M GETTIN'?

45:32.083 --> 45:34.917
- NO.
- WHO'S SUN TZU?

45:36.542 --> 45:38.834
A CHINESE
MILITARY THEORETICIAN
WHO POINTED OUT

45:38.834 --> 45:41.542
THAT IN A CONFLICT,
GETTING ANGRY,

45:41.542 --> 45:43.041
WHICH YOU SEEM
TO DO A LOT OF,

45:43.041 --> 45:47.041
IS A TACTICALLY AND
STRATEGICALLY STUPID MOVE.

45:47.041 --> 45:49.917
IT CLOUDS YOUR ABILITY
TO REASON.

45:49.917 --> 45:52.250
IT GIVES YOUR ADVERSARY
THE UPPER HAND.

45:52.250 --> 45:55.083
YOU WANNA CLOUD
YOUR ADVERSARY'S
ABILITY TO REASON,

45:55.083 --> 45:57.083
THUS GAINING
THE UPPER HAND YOURSELF.

46:01.500 --> 46:03.417
WHATEVER.

46:03.417 --> 46:05.709
YOU KNOW WHAT?
GIVEN HOW UNHAPPY
YOU SEEM TO BE,

46:05.709 --> 46:07.250
I CAN SEE HOW
THAT WOULDN'T BE

46:07.250 --> 46:08.750
THE EASIEST THING
FOR YOU TO DO.

46:08.750 --> 46:10.250
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

46:10.250 --> 46:13.375
JUST THAT.

46:13.375 --> 46:14.583
I MEAN,

46:14.583 --> 46:16.250
WHEN MEN ARE LITTLE BOYS,

46:16.250 --> 46:17.917
THEY'RE--THEY'RE ENCOURAGED
NOT TO CRY,

46:17.917 --> 46:20.125
NOT TO SHOW THEIR SADNESS,

46:20.125 --> 46:21.667
SO THEY'RE FORCED TO FIND
OTHER WAYS TO LET
THOSE FEELINGS OUT.

46:21.667 --> 46:22.583
AND AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW,

46:22.583 --> 46:25.250
FIGHTING AND GETTING ANGRY

46:25.250 --> 46:28.125
ARE MUCH MORE ACCEPTABLE
MALE BEHAVIORS.

46:28.125 --> 46:30.000
SO WHEN THESE LITTLE BOYS
GROW UP,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.208
GUESS WHAT OUTLET THEY USE
TO EXPRESS THEIR SADNESS.

46:32.208 --> 46:35.250
A GUY WHO'S MISERABLE AT WORK
OR DEPRESSED ABOUT HIS LIFE

46:35.250 --> 46:39.333
COMES HOME AT THE END
OF THE DAY,
WHAT DOES HE DO?

46:39.333 --> 46:43.458
HE DOESN'T USUALLY CRY
IN FRONT OF THE WIFE AND KIDS.

46:43.458 --> 46:45.000
HE USUALLY YELLS AT THEM.

46:50.291 --> 46:52.417
SO, LARRY...

46:52.417 --> 46:54.625
WHAT?

46:54.625 --> 46:57.291
WHAT IS IT EXACTLY
YOU'RE SO SAD ABOUT?

46:57.291 --> 47:00.125
[snickers]

47:00.125 --> 47:02.542
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

47:02.542 --> 47:06.417
[phone ringing]

47:08.375 --> 47:10.417
YO.

47:13.375 --> 47:14.667
YEAH.

47:14.667 --> 47:15.959
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FRIEND?

47:15.959 --> 47:19.166
MRS. LEONARD.
WHATEVER HER NAME IS.

47:22.583 --> 47:23.542
LOOK, I CAN'T RIGHT NOW,
I'M SORRY.

47:23.542 --> 47:26.625
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

47:26.625 --> 47:30.333
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME,
MA, THAT'S WHY.

47:30.333 --> 47:31.959
NO.

47:31.959 --> 47:33.625
OK, OK. ALL RIGHT.

47:33.625 --> 47:35.125
ALL RIGHT!

47:35.125 --> 47:36.834
OK, WHAT DO YOU WANT, BLOOD?

47:36.834 --> 47:37.667
I SAID OK.
I'M COMIN' OVER,
ALL RIGHT?

47:37.667 --> 47:40.208
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER THERE.

47:41.792 --> 47:43.667
I GOT TO, UH,
MAKE A QUICK DETOUR.

47:43.667 --> 47:46.166
YOU CAN STAY IN THE CAR.

47:48.250 --> 47:49.667
(mother)
OH, EASY. A LITTLE LOWER.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.667
(Larry)
RIGHT HERE?

47:51.667 --> 47:52.959
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER.

47:52.959 --> 47:54.458
A LITTLE LOWER.

47:54.458 --> 47:56.917
- - MA.
A LITTLE LOWER!

47:56.917 --> 47:59.583
ALL RIGHT,
RIGHT-- OHH, GOD.

47:59.583 --> 48:01.166
LOOK, MA,
IF MRS. LEONARD
ISN'T AROUND,

48:01.166 --> 48:04.166
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALL
A DOCTOR SOMETIMES.

48:04.166 --> 48:07.417
I CAN'T JUST DROP EVERYTHING
AND SHOW UP HERE
ALL THE TIME, OK?

48:07.417 --> 48:10.083
WHAT, AND I DIDN'T
DROP EVERYTHING FOR YOU?

48:10.083 --> 48:11.542
"OH, I'M SO SORRY, LARRY,

48:11.542 --> 48:13.125
"I CAN'T CHANGE
YOUR DIAPER NOW.

48:13.125 --> 48:14.667
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALL
MRS. LEONARD."

48:14.667 --> 48:16.875
[knocking on door]

48:16.875 --> 48:19.166
- LET ME JUST--
- LET ME. HOLD ON.

48:27.375 --> 48:29.166
WHAT?

48:29.166 --> 48:29.709
HE'S GOT TO PEE.

48:29.709 --> 48:31.834
I GOT TO PEE, LARRY.

48:33.041 --> 48:34.000
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO WAIT IN THE CAR.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.542
I THOUGHT YOU'D
PREFER IT IF WE CAME IN

48:36.542 --> 48:38.375
RATHER THAN TAKE
THE CAR SOMEWHERE.

48:38.375 --> 48:41.208
WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK
WE LAMMED OUT ON YOU.

48:41.208 --> 48:43.667
BESIDES, I WANT TO MEET
YOUR MOTHER.

48:43.667 --> 48:45.500
[scoffing]
NO.

48:45.500 --> 48:48.166
(mother) LARRY,
ARE THOSE FRIENDS OF YOURS?

48:49.917 --> 48:50.917
YEAH, CLOSE PERSONAL.

48:50.917 --> 48:52.667
- WELL,
INVITE THEM IN.

48:52.667 --> 48:55.166
- I GOT TO PEE, LARRY.

48:55.166 --> 48:57.667
- LARRY, INVITE THEM IN!

48:57.667 --> 49:00.208
I AM, MA,
ALL RIGHT?

49:04.750 --> 49:06.583
(mother)
WELL,

49:06.583 --> 49:07.667
[chuckling]

49:07.667 --> 49:09.625
HELLO, EVERYBODY.

49:09.625 --> 49:10.667
HELLO.

49:10.667 --> 49:12.458
MY GOD.

49:12.458 --> 49:14.458
WHAT A BEAUTY.

49:14.458 --> 49:15.041
MA.

49:15.041 --> 49:17.250
WHAT? I'M JUST SAYIN'.

49:17.250 --> 49:19.917
YOU SHOULD SEE
SOME OF THE PIGS
HE'S BROUGHT BY.

49:19.917 --> 49:20.959
I MEAN, NOT THAT
THEY WERE PIGS,
PER SE.

49:20.959 --> 49:23.792
IT'S JUST THAT,
BY AND LARGE,

49:23.792 --> 49:27.500
THEY WERE WHAT I WOULD CALL
INSIGNIFICANT WOMEN.

49:27.500 --> 49:29.375
YOU, I COULD TELL
RIGHT OFF THE BAT,

49:29.375 --> 49:31.959
YOU SEEM TO BE
OF SOME SUBSTANCE.

49:31.959 --> 49:33.792
EXCUSE ME, MISS,
WHERE'S THE MEN'S ROOM?

49:33.792 --> 49:37.250
OH, RIGHT THIS WAY,
DARLIN'.

49:37.250 --> 49:39.291
LARRY, SHE'S GORGEOUS.

49:39.291 --> 49:42.125
DON'T YOU FUCK THIS ONE UP.

49:42.125 --> 49:44.625
(mother)
SO, WHAT IS YOUR STORY,
HONEY?

49:44.625 --> 49:46.208
(Brian)
I'M LARRY'S FRIEND.

49:46.208 --> 49:47.792
DON'T, DON'T PAY
NO ATTENTION TO HER.

49:47.792 --> 49:49.417
SHE THINKS
I'M BEAUTIFUL.

49:49.417 --> 49:51.917
YEAH. SHE'S BLIND
IN ONE EYE, THOUGH.

49:51.917 --> 49:53.917
OPEN THE DOOR.

49:55.125 --> 49:55.917
YOU ALL RIGHT IN THERE?

49:55.917 --> 50:00.291
SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU GREW UP?

50:00.291 --> 50:02.542
ARE YOU WRITIN'
A BOOK?

50:09.709 --> 50:12.959
- [sighing]
- MA.

50:12.959 --> 50:16.333
OH, SHUT UP.
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

50:16.333 --> 50:20.083
I THINK YOU TWO MAKE
A VERY CUTE COUPLE, THOUGH.

50:20.083 --> 50:21.625
- MA.
- WHAT?

50:21.625 --> 50:23.959
WHAT'S WITH THE
"MA, MA, MA, MA, MA"?

50:23.959 --> 50:26.667
STOP ALREADY WITH THE "MA."

50:27.959 --> 50:30.291
SO, TELL ME,

50:30.291 --> 50:32.667
- ARE YOU AND LARRY SWEETHEARTS?
- MA!

50:32.667 --> 50:35.041
BEFORE YOU ANSWER,
LET ME SAY UP FRONT

50:35.041 --> 50:36.959
THAT I HOPE SO.

50:36.959 --> 50:39.458
WHAT?
YES, I HOPE SO.

50:39.458 --> 50:41.709
WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE
ABOUT "I HOPE SO"?

50:41.709 --> 50:42.750
YEAH? GUESS WHAT.

50:42.750 --> 50:43.750
WHAT?

50:43.750 --> 50:45.250
SHE'S A LESBIAN.

50:51.542 --> 50:53.542
NEVER MIND.

50:53.542 --> 50:55.250
SHE'S BEEN WITH
FELLAS BEFORE.

50:55.250 --> 50:57.625
AM I RIGHT, DARLIN'?

50:57.625 --> 50:59.000
HUH?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.542
(Ricki)
YOU'RE RIGHT.

51:01.542 --> 51:04.709
BUT SOMETIMES
THEY HAVE
THEIR LIMITATIONS.

51:04.709 --> 51:06.959
AM I RIGHT?

51:06.959 --> 51:08.083
YEAH.

51:08.083 --> 51:11.542
[both laughing]

51:11.542 --> 51:13.000
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
TALKIN' ABOUT?

51:13.000 --> 51:14.500
OH, NEVER MIND.

51:14.500 --> 51:15.917
WE KNOW WHAT
WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.

51:15.917 --> 51:17.250
AM I RIGHT,
SWEETHEART?

51:17.250 --> 51:19.000
YOU'RE RIGHT.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.458
YOU KNOW,

51:20.458 --> 51:23.208
I WASN'T ALWAYS
JUST LARRY'S MOTHER.

51:23.208 --> 51:24.959
MMM, I USED TO BE

51:24.959 --> 51:27.166
QUITE EXPERIMENTAL.

51:27.166 --> 51:29.250
- OH, JESUS CHRIST!
- LOOK AT HIM!

51:29.250 --> 51:32.041
LOOK WHO'S NOT
UP-TO-THE-MINUTE NOW.

51:32.041 --> 51:33.917
- BIG BOY.
- THAT'S IT.
WE'RE GOIN'.

51:33.917 --> 51:36.333
BRIAN, COME ON.
WE'RE GOIN'. THAT'S IT.
MA, WHAT THE...

51:36.333 --> 51:38.250
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
JUST REMEMBER, YOU TWO,

51:38.250 --> 51:40.208
LIFE'S NOT JUST
BLACK-AND-WHITE.

51:40.208 --> 51:41.166
ALL RIGHT, MA,
WE'LL REMEMBER THAT.
BRIAN, LET'S GO.

51:41.166 --> 51:43.667
WE'RE GOIN' NOW.
WE'RE GOIN'. LET'S GO.

51:43.667 --> 51:46.333
COME HERE, YOU BIG LUG,
GIVE ME A KISS.

51:46.333 --> 51:48.875
- I LOVE YOU.
- YEAH.

51:48.875 --> 51:51.458
- I WASHED MY HANDS, LARRY.
- CONGRATULATIONS. LET'S GO.

51:51.458 --> 51:54.500
- GOODBYE.
- COME HERE, DARLIN'.

51:54.500 --> 51:55.667
[sighing]

51:55.667 --> 51:57.625
I FEEL LIKE
I KNOW YOU ALREADY.

51:57.625 --> 51:59.709
- VERY NICE MEETING YOU.
- IT'S MY PLEASURE.

51:59.709 --> 52:01.291
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOIN'.
LET'S GO.

52:01.291 --> 52:03.333
COME ON. LET'S GO, BRIAN.

52:03.333 --> 52:06.000
JUST REMEMBER, YOU TWO,
KEEP AN OPEN MIND

52:06.000 --> 52:07.583
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW.

52:07.583 --> 52:09.458
- WE WILL.
- BYE.
- BYE.

52:09.458 --> 52:11.041
(Ricki)
I LIKE HER,
SHE'S VERY NICE.

52:11.041 --> 52:12.750
(Larry)
OH, MAN.

52:22.291 --> 52:25.250
(woman on phone)
ON THE SATELLITE MAP,
THE CLOUD OVER QUEENSLAND

52:25.250 --> 52:27.291
AND NEW SOUTH WALES
IS BRINGING SHOWERS,

52:27.291 --> 52:28.125
AND THERE'S VERY
LITTLE ACTIVITY

52:28.125 --> 52:30.875
OVER THE REST
OF THE CONTINENT.

52:30.875 --> 52:33.125
BUT THERE IS
SOME LOW-LEVEL CLOUD
OVER SOUTHERN VICTORIA

52:33.125 --> 52:36.000
WHICH WILL BRING
ISOLATED SHOWERS
MAINLY TO COASTAL AREAS.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.291
ANOTHER CHILLY NIGHT
IN MELBOURNE'S OUTER SUBURBS
WITH THE MERCURY...

52:39.291 --> 52:41.500
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING NOW?

52:41.500 --> 52:42.500
...AND AVALON FALLING
AS LOW...

52:42.500 --> 52:45.125
BRIAN, I TOLD YOU,
THIS IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

52:45.125 --> 52:47.375
IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE.

52:47.375 --> 52:49.125
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.

52:49.125 --> 52:51.125
WHAT--WHAT ARE--
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

52:51.125 --> 52:52.959
WHAT DO YOU CARE
ABOUT THE WEATHER
IN FUCKING ENGLAND FOR?

52:52.959 --> 52:55.250
IT'S IN AUSTRALIA.

52:55.250 --> 52:57.625
- WHATEVER.
- IT'S NOT ENGLAND.

52:57.625 --> 52:59.500
WHATEVER, BRIAN.
WHY DO YOU KEEP
CALLING THERE?

53:04.458 --> 53:06.417
'CAUSE I REALLY, REALLY
LIKE HER VOICE.

53:11.834 --> 53:15.250
OK. TRY TO KEEP IT
UNDER CONTROL, THOUGH.

53:15.250 --> 53:16.333
ALL RIGHT?

53:16.333 --> 53:16.834
OK, LARRY, I'LL TRY.

53:16.834 --> 53:17.917
THANK YOU.

53:17.917 --> 53:20.417
YOU'RE WELCOME.

53:39.125 --> 53:40.500
[exhaling]

53:43.208 --> 53:45.375
SO I'M NOT
YOUR TYPE, HUH?

53:46.917 --> 53:50.625
HOW DID WE GET BACK THERE
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

53:50.625 --> 53:52.500
RELAX.

53:52.500 --> 53:54.583
YOU'RE MORE WOMAN
THAN I KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH.

53:54.583 --> 53:58.041
I DON'T NEED TO BE
DIPPIN' INTO
THE SISTERHOOD.

53:58.041 --> 54:01.375
BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS,
BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW

54:01.375 --> 54:03.667
YOU SAY YOU'VE
BEEN WITH GUYS.

54:03.667 --> 54:06.542
I HAVE.

54:06.542 --> 54:10.583
BUT THEY HAVE THEIR, UH,
SHORTCOMINGS...

54:10.583 --> 54:13.375
WELL, BESIDES THE FACT THAT
THEY GIVE TERRIBLE HEAD.

54:13.375 --> 54:17.375
SEE, RIGHT THERE,
THAT TELLS ME SOMETHING.

54:17.375 --> 54:19.583
I KNOW THE GUYS
YOU'VE BEEN WITH
OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW

54:19.583 --> 54:22.750
HOW TO, UH, HOW TO
BRING HOME THE PEARLS

54:22.750 --> 54:25.500
WHEN THEY WERE
DIVING FOR OYSTERS.

54:25.500 --> 54:26.667
I WAS ACTUALLY JUST JOKING.

54:26.667 --> 54:29.291
EH, WELL,
SINCE WE'RE LETTING IT
ALL HANG OUT NOW,

54:29.291 --> 54:31.792
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

54:31.792 --> 54:34.417
OK, WHEN IT COMES
TO PLEASING A WOMAN,

54:34.417 --> 54:36.917
YOUR GIRLFRIENDS,
THEY'RE JUST...

54:36.917 --> 54:39.417
THEY'RE AT
A NATURAL DISADVANTAGE.

54:39.417 --> 54:40.250
IT'S LIKE THEY
MIGHT TRY HARD,

54:40.250 --> 54:42.834
BUT THEY'RE
JUST NOT BACKED UP

54:42.834 --> 54:45.083
WITH MILLIONS OF YEARS
OF GENETIC ENGINEERING,

54:45.083 --> 54:48.875
PROGRAMMING, INSTINCT.

54:48.875 --> 54:52.917
(Larry)
NATURE HAS EVOLVED MAN
FOR THAT PURPOSE.

54:52.917 --> 54:55.875
SATISFY.

54:55.875 --> 54:58.291
LEAD THE PACK.

54:58.291 --> 55:01.083
THAT'S WHY THESE LESBIANS
ARE ALWAYS GOING OUT BUYING,
YOU KNOW,

55:01.083 --> 55:03.667
SPENDING ALL THEIR DOUGH
ON, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

55:03.667 --> 55:07.542
SEXUAL APPLIANCES,
EROTIC MONKEY WRENCHES
AND SHIT,

55:07.542 --> 55:09.625
TRYING TO COMPENSATE

55:09.625 --> 55:13.917
FOR WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE.
WHAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING.

55:13.917 --> 55:15.250
THE PENIS.

55:15.250 --> 55:18.000

- HUH?

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:48.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING  HERE?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.208
[gasps]
I'M STALKING YOU.

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:51.417
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU KNOW HER?

01:05:51.417 --> 01:05:54.166
FIRST OF ALL,
DO NOT SAY MY NAME
IN THIS ROOM. ALL RIGHT?

01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:56.000
SECOND OF ALL,
YOU'RE OUT OF LINE.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.667
THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL
SITUATION,

01:05:57.667 --> 01:05:59.417
AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO INTRUDE HERE.

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:01.750
WHAT KIND OF
PROFESSIONAL SITUATION?

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:03.625
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:05.291
A FUCKING MAN?

01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:07.834
OK. I--I REALLY THOUGHT
THIS WAS ALL ABOUT SHARON.

01:06:07.834 --> 01:06:09.542
WHAT, ARE YOU TELLING PEOPLE
WHERE WE ARE NOW?

01:06:09.542 --> 01:06:11.041
MIND YOUR OWN
FUCKING BUSINESS.

01:06:11.041 --> 01:06:11.917
- SHUT THE FUCK UP.
- BLOW ME.

01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:14.500
LISTEN, BOTH OF YOU
SHUT UP!

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.959
LOOK, I HAVEN'T TOLD
ANYBODY WHERE WE ARE.

01:06:16.959 --> 01:06:18.000
AND, ROBIN,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.250
THIS IS
A PROFESSIONAL SITUATION.

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:24.166
OUR PROBLEMS
HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH SHARON,

01:06:24.166 --> 01:06:26.834
AND THEY HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM!

01:06:26.834 --> 01:06:28.834
I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW!

01:06:28.834 --> 01:06:30.333
- NO! UH-UH!
- PLEASE.

01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:32.166
I'M NOT LEAVING,
HE'S LEAVING.

01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:34.166
WHAT? WHO THE FUCK
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

01:06:34.166 --> 01:06:36.125
I FUCKING LIVE HERE.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:38.333
YEAH?
WELL, NEITHER AM I.

01:06:38.333 --> 01:06:39.750
GONNA BE
ALL THERE IS TO THAT.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:41.375
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:42.917
HOW ABOUT IF
I THROW YOU THE FUCK OUT?

01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:44.709
HOW ABOUT
IF I ROUNDHOUSE YOU

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:46.250
UPSIDE YOUR FAT FUCKING
HEAD AND COLLAPSE YOUR SKULL?

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:47.458
I DON'T KNOW.
GIVE IT A SHOT.

01:06:47.458 --> 01:06:50.375
NO, DON'T. BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
HOW TO DO THAT STUFF, OK?

01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:52.250
- DON'T BE ALL MACHO--
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
WHAT SHE KNOWS!

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:53.375
THIS AIN'T FUCKING
LESBIAN TALK-CIRCLE TIME!

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:55.834
WE GOT SOMETHING TO DO.
YOU'RE GETTING THE FUCK OUT.

01:06:55.834 --> 01:06:56.750
GOT IT?
- I MEAN, THIS?

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:59.125
YOU--YOU NEED THIS?

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.000
YOU NEED, LIKE,
A LITTLE FREEDOM
OR SOMETHING?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.667
YOU WANNA DABBLE?
WE CAN ALL FUCK.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:05.625
YOU KNOW, WE CAN ALL HAVE
SEX TOGETHER, THAT'S FINE.

01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:07.792
WHAT DO YOU SAY, HOT ROCKS?
WOULD YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:10.250

OUT OF YOUR MIND.

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:12.834

HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIM.

01:07:12.834 --> 01:07:15.125
IT'S OVER.

01:07:15.125 --> 01:07:18.000
AND IT'S NOT HIM.
IT'S US, HONEY.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.709
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S NOT YOU,
IT'S HER. WHATEVER.

01:07:19.709 --> 01:07:22.250
JUST SHUT UP FOR ONE SECOND!
GOD! FUCK!

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:24.500
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HIM.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.041
[sobs]

01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:28.875
IT'S JUST, WE'RE OVER.

01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:31.542
NO, WE'RE NOT OVER.

01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:33.625
WE'LL--WE'LL ALL
SET UP TOGETHER,
THE THREE OF US,

01:07:33.625 --> 01:07:35.375
TILL YOU GET THIS
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.

01:07:35.375 --> 01:07:36.125
BABY, YOU'RE NOT
HEARING ME.

01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:38.750
I'M FUCKING HEARING YOU.
OK?

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.667
I'M FUCKING HEARING YOU!

01:07:40.667 --> 01:07:42.542
GOD DAMN IT!

01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:47.417
SEE, I'M GONNA
KILL MYSELF RIGHT NOW
AND YOU CARE,

01:07:47.417 --> 01:07:49.000
YOU CARE BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME.
- THAT'S A NICE GIRL.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.917
SHUT THE FUCK UP,
ALL RIGHT!

01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:52.542
HEY, WHAT--

01:07:52.542 --> 01:07:54.041
OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

01:07:54.041 --> 01:07:55.458
WHAT DID YOU...

01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:57.959
- OH, NO. OH, NO.
- [whooping]

01:07:57.959 --> 01:07:59.417
(Ricki)
WHAT DID YOU DO?

01:07:59.417 --> 01:08:01.041
- THIS HOT ENOUGH
FOR YOU, BABY?

01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:02.709
- GET AWAY FROM ME.
- YOU WANT SOME?

01:08:02.709 --> 01:08:04.375
- SIT DOWN.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!

01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:05.166
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

01:08:05.166 --> 01:08:07.625
LADY, YOU NEED SOME
BAND-AIDS.

01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:15.375
(Larry)
THIS MUST BE
MENTAL-FUCKING-ILLNESS WEEK.

01:08:26.417 --> 01:08:31.125
THAT WOMAN...
IS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL.

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:33.792
[chuckling]
YES.

01:08:33.792 --> 01:08:35.375
SHE'S LIKE
THE ONES AT THE BAYWATCH.

01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:39.082
YES.

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:41.417
THEY MAKE MY PENIS SNEEZE.

01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:45.417
[laughs]

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:49.207
YOU GOT A GOOD
SENSE OF HUMOR,
YOU KNOW THAT?

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:50.792
GOD BLESS YOU.

01:08:53.332 --> 01:08:55.582
- THANK YOU.
- NO, NOT YOU, STUPID.

01:08:55.582 --> 01:08:56.917
WHEN MY PENIS SNEEZES,
I SAY, "GOD BLESS YOU."

01:08:56.917 --> 01:08:59.667
GOD BLESS YOU, PENIS.

01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:02.417
[snorts]

01:09:18.792 --> 01:09:21.207
SHE'S GONNA BE OK.

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:22.417
OH, WHAT A RELIEF.

01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:26.291
BRIAN, WOULD YOU
EXCUSE US?

01:09:26.291 --> 01:09:28.125
I WANNA TALK
TO LARRY FOR A MINUTE. OK?

01:09:28.125 --> 01:09:30.291
YOU BE ALL RIGHT
IN THE CAR?

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.375
- YEAH.
- OK, GOOD.

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.667
I JUST...

01:09:45.667 --> 01:09:49.166
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I'M NOT UP FOR THIS
THUMB DEAL.

01:09:49.166 --> 01:09:50.332
I SAY WE DON'T DO IT.

01:09:56.166 --> 01:09:59.125
YOU TRYING
TO TEST ME?

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:01.542
IS THAT IT? YOU WANNA SEE
IF I'M GONNA DO WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO?

01:10:01.542 --> 01:10:04.709
NO.

01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:08.208
SO, WHAT ARE YOU,
A CONTRACTOR
WITH A CONSCIENCE?

01:10:09.834 --> 01:10:12.333
LOOK, I'VE DONE
SOME BAD THINGS,

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:16.000
BUT I DIDN'T SIGN ON TO THIS
TO BE A BRUTAL STREET THUG.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.333
BECAUSE FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THAT'S NOT THE JOB I TOOK.

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:26.875
HOW WOULD YOU
GET AROUND IT?

01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:28.917
I'D WORK IT OUT.

01:10:28.917 --> 01:10:33.250
BUT FIRST I GOT TO KNOW,
ARE YOU WITH ME?

01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:44.875
SURE.

01:10:44.875 --> 01:10:46.166
SURE OR YES?

01:10:46.166 --> 01:10:47.500
THAT'S THE SAME THING.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.375
NO, IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING.

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:51.125
SEE, IF I WERE TO ASK YOU
TO MOVE MY COUCH FOR ME,

01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:53.875
YOU'D PROBABLY SAY, "SURE."

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:56.625
BUT IF I WERE TO ASK YOU
TO LOOK DEEP INTO MY EYES,

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:58.542
AND TELL ME FROM
THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART

01:10:58.542 --> 01:11:00.333
IF IT WOULD GIVE
YOU GREAT PLEASURE

01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:03.083
IF I WERE TO SUCK YOUR COCK
FOR 12 HOURS,

01:11:03.083 --> 01:11:06.667
IF I MAY BE PRESUMPTUOUS,
YOU'D PROBABLY SAY, "YES."

01:11:06.667 --> 01:11:11.250
SEE, IT JUST IMPLIES
A DIFFERENT LEVEL
OF COMMITMENT.

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:16.041
ASK ME THE QUESTION AGAIN.

01:11:16.041 --> 01:11:18.667
OK. ARE YOU WITH ME?

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:21.792
YES.

01:11:26.083 --> 01:11:27.583
GOOD.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.166
- ISN'T THIS "B" LEVEL?
- THIS IS "D" LEVEL.
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:35.834
WELL, I'M LOOKING
FOR "B" LEVEL.

01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:37.542
NO, THIS IS A "D" LEVEL
AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED
ON "D" LEVEL.

01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:38.583
SO YOU NEED TO GO BACK
TO "B" LEVEL.

01:11:38.583 --> 01:11:41.125
OK, HOLD ON, BECAUSE
YOU'RE CONFUSING ME, OK?

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:43.417
NO, YOU'RE CONFUSING ME.

01:11:43.417 --> 01:11:44.625
LET'S JUST START
FROM THE BEGINNING.

01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:45.250
IF THIS ISN'T "B"--

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:47.333
[gasping]
OH, MY GOD.

01:11:47.333 --> 01:11:50.625
OH, MY GOD.
I AM SO SORRY.

01:11:50.625 --> 01:11:52.041
- OH, THAT'S OK.
- I'M SORRY.

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:52.417
SHH.

01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:58.917
(Ricki)
JUST SOAK THAT IN COLD WATER
AND IT'LL COME RIGHT OUT, OK?

01:11:58.917 --> 01:12:02.000
I PROMISE YOU.
YES. NO, IT WILL. IT WILL.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.583
LOOK, THE THING IS,
THE REASON I'M HERE

01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:06.083
IS THEY TOLD ME TO GO
AROUND THE CORNER...

01:12:06.083 --> 01:12:08.583
- CLOSE YOUR EYES.
- WHAT?

01:12:08.583 --> 01:12:10.458
[whispering]
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
FOLLOW ME.

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:12.375
JUST WALK IN.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
DON'T LOOK.

COME ON. GO, GO, GO.
YOU'RE FINE.

01:12:20.417 --> 01:12:23.458
- CAN I OPEN THEM?
- NO. STAND RIGHT HERE.

01:12:23.458 --> 01:12:24.917
- IT'S COLD IN HERE.
- SHH.

01:12:24.917 --> 01:12:26.583

01:12:36.417 --> 01:12:37.750
CAN I OPEN 'EM?

NO.

01:17:35.166 --> 01:17:35.959
[keys jingling]

01:17:40.875 --> 01:17:43.917
DO YOU THINK
YOUR FINGERNAILS

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.625
THEY'RE FINE.

01:17:56.875 --> 01:18:00.333
WHAT? YOU DON'T LIKE
MY FINGERNAILS NOW?

01:18:02.375 --> 01:18:07.417
LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA
IF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT,
BUT I'VE HEARD IT SAID

01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:09.375
THAT THOSE WHO ARE BALANCED

01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:11.667
MORE TOWARD
THE MASCULINE OF EITHER SEX

01:18:11.667 --> 01:18:12.875
CHECK THEIR
FINGERNAILS THIS WAY.

01:18:12.875 --> 01:18:16.333
AND THOSE BALANCED MORE
TOWARD THE FEMININE

01:18:16.333 --> 01:18:18.959
CHECK THEM THAT WAY.

01:18:18.959 --> 01:18:21.583
AND I JUST HAD A FEELING
THAT EVEN THOUGH

01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:23.834
YOU HAVE THIS TOUGH GUY THING

01:18:23.834 --> 01:18:27.667

(Larry)
THAT'S FUCKIN' BULLSHIT.

01:18:29.834 --> 01:18:32.000
I--I CAN'T SEE.
I'M FARSIGHTED.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.834
NEARSIGHTED.
WHATEVER IT IS.

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:37.959
SO I HOLD 'EM OUT HERE,
BUT I CAN'T SEE 'EM UP CLOSE.

01:18:37.959 --> 01:18:41.500
YOU WANNA FIND OUT HOW
SOMEBODY'S BALANCED TOWARD
A MASCULINE, LOOK AT ME.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.917
I CAN'T SEE.
THAT'S WHY I HOLD 'EM FAR AWAY.

01:18:43.917 --> 01:18:47.041
- [chuckling] ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH, IT IS  ALL RIGHT.

01:18:47.041 --> 01:18:48.417
NO, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

01:18:48.417 --> 01:18:50.041
I WAS GONNA GO LIKE THIS,

01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:51.834
THAT'S WHAT I WANNA DO.
BUT I KNOW I CAN'T SEE,

01:18:51.834 --> 01:18:53.542
SO I HOLD THEM OUT

01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:55.083
ALL RIGHT.

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:08.792
DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.
I SEE YOU LOOKING AT ME.

NO! I'M NOT GAY!

01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:19.583
I AM NOT GAY.
WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME
AND THINK I'M GAY?

01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:21.917
I AM NOT FUCKING GAY!

01:19:21.917 --> 01:19:23.083
ARE YOU SURE?

01:19:23.083 --> 01:19:25.792
YEAH, I'M FUCKIN' SURE.

01:19:25.792 --> 01:19:29.500
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I BET YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.250
- THANK YOU.

01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:36.375

I DON'T KNOW.

01:19:58.208 --> 01:20:01.542
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
YOU KNOW I CAN
KICK YOUR ASS.

01:20:01.542 --> 01:20:03.333
MAYBE THAT TURNS YOU ON.

01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:07.458
YOU CANNOT KICK MY ASS.

01:20:25.625 --> 01:20:27.542

01:21:59.208 --> 01:22:01.583
ABOUT WHAT FEELS BETTER
TO ANOTHER WOMAN.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.417
SHE'S A WOMAN HERSELF.

01:22:03.417 --> 01:22:05.583
A GUY MIGHT BE AT
A CERTAIN DISADVANTAGE.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.083
HUH? I'M USED TO
THE FINER THINGS.

01:29:01.083 --> 01:29:02.458
LOUIS, AM I RIGHT?

01:29:02.458 --> 01:29:04.083
YOU ARE RIGHT.

01:29:04.083 --> 01:29:09.000
IT CAN'T BE.
SO I THINK WE CAN SAY

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.500
BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT,
THAT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.500
(Starkman)
HUH?

01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:21.000
SOMEWHERE, A MISTAKE
HAS BEEN MADE.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.208
DID YOU KNOW

01:29:26.208 --> 01:29:29.000
THAT APPARENTLY SOME PEOPLE

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.500
DO NOT REGARD THE THUMB,
TECHNICALLY, TO BE A FINGER?

01:29:36.583 --> 01:29:38.917
CURIOUS FOR MYSELF,
I TURNED TO LOUIS HERE,

01:29:38.917 --> 01:29:45.000
WHO, WITH HIS
NEWFOUND DICTIONARY SKILLS,
LOOKED IT UP FOR ME.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.208
YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAID?

01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:47.667
NO.

01:29:47.667 --> 01:29:50.125
TELL HIM
WHAT IT SAID, LOUIS.

01:29:50.125 --> 01:29:51.125
[clears throat]

01:29:51.125 --> 01:29:52.667
IT SAID, QUOTE:

01:29:52.667 --> 01:29:54.500
"THE SHORT, THICK,
INNER DIGIT OF THE HAND

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.417
NEXT TO THE FOREFINGER."
UNQUOTE.

01:29:56.417 --> 01:30:00.041
NOW IT SAID,
"DIGIT," NOT "FINGER."

01:30:00.041 --> 01:30:03.041
SO I STILL DON'T
REALLY KNOW, TECHNICALLY,

01:30:03.041 --> 01:30:05.250
IF IT'S CONSIDERED
A FINGER OR NOT.

01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:07.333
RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

01:30:07.333 --> 01:30:10.375
RIGHT. LOOK AT HIM.
I LOVE HIM.

01:30:10.375 --> 01:30:13.083
I LOVE THIS GUY.
HE EATS NO MATTER WHAT.

01:30:13.083 --> 01:30:14.041
I LOVE YOU, LOUIS.

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.709
WHAT'S THIS?

01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:20.041
WHAT IS THIS?
LOUIS...

01:30:20.041 --> 01:30:24.083
I'VE BEEN SUBPOENAED.

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:28.458
I CAN'T BE CONSORTING
WITH ARMED FELONS.

01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:32.834
A LITTLE CONSIDERATION,
PLEASE.

01:30:32.834 --> 01:30:36.500
BESIDES, YOU THINK SOMETHING
LIKE THIS IS NECESSARY,

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.458
ANYWAY, TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE?

01:30:41.834 --> 01:30:44.333
I SAY INTIMIDATION
COMES FROM WITHIN.

01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:48.166
THERE ARE A MULTITUDE
OF QUALITIES AN INDIVIDUAL
CAN POSSESS

01:30:48.166 --> 01:30:50.291
THAT MAKE THEM INTIMIDATING.

01:30:50.291 --> 01:30:52.750
NOT ONLY THIS,
THIS IS THE OUTSIDE.

01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:54.583
THEN THERE'S THE INSIDE.

01:30:54.583 --> 01:30:58.250
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S
THE MOST INTIMIDATING QUALITY?

01:30:58.250 --> 01:31:00.125
NOT THAT YOU ASKED.

01:31:00.125 --> 01:31:03.583
BUT THE ABSOLUTELY
MOST INTIMIDATING,
IN MY OPINION?

01:31:03.583 --> 01:31:07.792
WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL
JUST DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.

01:31:07.792 --> 01:31:09.166
LOUIS, YOU WANNA GO
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL?

01:31:09.166 --> 01:31:11.667
MEDICAL SCHOOL?

01:31:13.041 --> 01:31:14.125
[gasps]

01:31:14.125 --> 01:31:15.709
YES!

01:31:18.041 --> 01:31:22.792
STUDENTS THERE CAN ALWAYS USE
SOMETHING TO LEARN ON.

01:31:23.291 --> 01:31:24.709
[wheezing laugh]

01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:29.583
I FEEL LIKE I'M FLOATING.

01:31:31.291 --> 01:31:33.959
(Starkman)
I FEEL...

01:31:33.959 --> 01:31:36.625
RELEASED.

01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:43.125
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

01:31:43.125 --> 01:31:45.000
I DON'T.

01:31:54.667 --> 01:31:58.709
I HAVE NO COMPUNCTIONS,

01:31:58.709 --> 01:32:02.000
NONE WHATSOEVER.

01:32:05.208 --> 01:32:08.709
AND I AM VERY CONCERNED

01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:12.917
ABOUT THE WAY
THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT HERE.

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.917
HOW WAS THE BLEEDING?

01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:28.542
THE BLEEDING?

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:31.417
NO, NO, NO.
NOT HIM.

01:32:31.417 --> 01:32:33.041
[wheezing laugh]

01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:36.041
THE RETARD,
WHEN YOU CUT HIS THUMB OFF.

01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:40.000
LOUIS, UH, TOLD ME
YOU WERE CONCERNED.

01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:46.667
BLEEDING WAS FINE.

01:32:49.125 --> 01:32:51.208
FINE?

01:32:51.208 --> 01:32:53.500
IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

01:32:56.125 --> 01:32:58.959
OK. GOOD.

01:33:05.083 --> 01:33:08.000
I DIDN'T NEED
YOUR HELP, YOU KNOW.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.291
I COULD HAVE BEATEN
THESE CHARGES.

01:33:11.291 --> 01:33:13.750
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:18.834
YOU WERE GONNA EXTORT
A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR.

01:33:18.834 --> 01:33:22.959
YOU THOUGHT
YOU COULD SAY...

01:33:22.959 --> 01:33:25.333
"KIDNAPPED YOUR
LITTLE BROTHER,
DROP ALL CHARGES,"

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:29.417
AND THE GUY'D ROLL OVER?

01:33:29.417 --> 01:33:33.667
YOU DIDN'T THINK ALL HELL
WOULDN'T BREAK LOOSE?

01:33:34.917 --> 01:33:37.834
YOU DIDN'T THINK
EVERY FUCKING FED

01:33:37.834 --> 01:33:41.083
WOULDN'T DROP
WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING

01:33:41.083 --> 01:33:45.125
AND DIVE IN TO PROTECT
ONE OF THEIR OWN?

01:33:46.417 --> 01:33:49.625
WHAT DO YOU MORONS THINK,

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:52.750
THIS IS LITTLE ITALY?!

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.333
WAKE UP!

01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:58.917
THIS IS THE
TWENTY-FUCKING-FIRST CENTURY!

01:34:13.125 --> 01:34:15.959
SO NOW...

01:34:17.333 --> 01:34:19.875
THINGS ARE BAD.

01:34:21.917 --> 01:34:25.375
AND WHETHER YOU
WANNA CALL A THUMB

01:34:25.375 --> 01:34:28.208
A FINGER OR A DIGIT,

01:34:28.208 --> 01:34:32.208
FOR THE SAKE OF
THIS DISCUSSION,
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:34.959
YOU KNOW WHY?

01:34:34.959 --> 01:34:40.000
BECAUSE WHATEVER
YOU CHOOSE TO CALL IT,

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.875
A THUMB

01:34:41.875 --> 01:34:44.959
HAS A FINGERPRINT,

01:34:44.959 --> 01:34:47.500
AND THE ONE YOU SENT

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:52.250
HAD THE WRONG FUCKING ONE.

01:34:54.625 --> 01:34:55.834
MR. STARKMAN--

01:34:55.834 --> 01:34:58.625
I KNOW MY FUCKING NAME,

01:34:58.625 --> 01:35:00.875
YOU PIECE OF SHIT!

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.667
YOU DON'T TRY TO EXTORT

01:35:08.667 --> 01:35:11.959
A FEDERAL FUCKING PROSECUTOR!

01:35:15.250 --> 01:35:18.458
AND IF YOU DO,

01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:23.000
YOU DON'T FUCK AROUND!

01:35:28.458 --> 01:35:30.041
FUCK THIS.

01:35:30.041 --> 01:35:31.625
CUTTING OFF HIS THUMB
WAS A STUPID ORDER

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:34.875
AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DERELICT
IN OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
IF WE HAD FOLLOWED IT.

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.125
HELLO.

01:35:39.125 --> 01:35:40.875
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE COULDA
KEPT BELOW THE RADAR

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:43.375
WITH A THUMBLESS,
BLEEDING HALF-WIT?

01:35:43.375 --> 01:35:46.625
YOU SEE, SOMETIMES

01:35:46.625 --> 01:35:50.750
ONE HAS TO USE
THEIR PROFESSIONAL
PREROGATIVE

01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:54.250
TO OVERRIDE
A DUMB REQUEST.

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.500
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:00.333
EVEN AT THIS POINT
IF YOU WERE TO ASK US

01:36:00.333 --> 01:36:04.917
TO PURSUE
A COURSE OF ACTION
THAT WOULD BE,

01:36:04.917 --> 01:36:09.125
LET'S SAY, CONTRARY
TO YOUR BEST INTERESTS,

01:36:09.125 --> 01:36:11.917
THEN AS AWKWARD
AS IT MIGHT BE,

01:36:11.917 --> 01:36:15.125
WE WOULD HAVE TO
TAKE EXCEPTION.

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:22.792
ASIDE FROM THOSE OF US
HERE IN THIS ROOM,

01:36:22.792 --> 01:36:24.917
THERE IS ONLY
ONE PERSON, REALLY,

01:36:24.917 --> 01:36:27.750
THAT CAN LINK YOU
TO THIS FUCK-UP.

01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:32.875
AND I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD...

01:36:32.875 --> 01:36:36.083
RECTIFY THAT PROBLEM
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:43.458
I THINK I'D MUCH PREFER
JUST TO,

01:36:43.458 --> 01:36:46.583
YOU KNOW,

01:36:46.583 --> 01:36:49.041
END IT RIGHT HERE.

01:36:50.208 --> 01:36:52.083
HMM.

01:36:52.083 --> 01:36:55.333
AND THAT WOULD BE
YOUR PROFESSIONAL
PREROGATIVE.

01:36:55.333 --> 01:36:58.333
IF YOU THINK THAT HAVING
THAT KID PICKED UP
BY THE AUTHORITIES

01:36:58.333 --> 01:37:00.208
AND TELLING THEM ALL
ABOUT BEING KIDNAPPED

01:37:00.208 --> 01:37:04.208
IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE
YOUR ASS MAKES ANY SENSE.

01:37:04.208 --> 01:37:08.375
IF YOU THINK
THAT'S THE BEST TACTIC
TO KEEP YOU OUT OF JAIL.

01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:10.375
IF YOU THINK
THAT'S ANY LESS DUMB

01:37:10.375 --> 01:37:11.875
THAN ASKING TO HAVE
HIS FINGER CUT OFF,

01:37:11.875 --> 01:37:15.291
[chuckling]
WELL, THEN THAT WOULD BE

01:37:15.291 --> 01:37:17.041
THE THING
THAT YOU SHOULD DO.

01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:22.834
BUT IF YOU DON'T,

01:37:22.834 --> 01:37:25.959
THEN LET US
TAKE THE THORN
OUT OF YOUR SIDE.

01:37:25.959 --> 01:37:26.875
LET US MAKE SURE
THAT KID WILL NEVER BE

01:37:26.875 --> 01:37:30.041
ABLE TO TESTIFY
AGAINST ANYBODY.

01:37:33.208 --> 01:37:36.709
AND IF AFTER THAT
YOU'RE STILL NOT HAPPY,

01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:40.125
THEN WE CAN
ALL TALK AGAIN.

01:37:47.542 --> 01:37:50.583
(Larry) YOU WERE KIDDING, RIGHT?
- (Ricki) WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:37:50.583 --> 01:37:54.166
WE'LL JUST TAKE BRIAN BACK
TO WHERE YOU FOUND HIM
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:58.291
ARE WE GOING TO
THE BAYWATCH NOW?

01:37:58.291 --> 01:38:00.500
NO, WE CAN'T GO
TO THE BAYWATCH NOW.

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.458
TAKE YOU LATER.

01:38:07.208 --> 01:38:09.667
MAYBE THIS IS IT. I MEAN,
MAYBE THIS IS THE THING,
YOU KNOW.

01:38:09.667 --> 01:38:12.208
MAYBE THIS IS, LIKE, A SIGN
COMING FROM NOWHERE,
FROM OUT OF THE BLUE,

01:38:12.208 --> 01:38:15.542
JUST TELLING ME IT'S TIME.
IT'S TIME TO GET OUT.

01:38:15.542 --> 01:38:17.333

YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND?

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:16.500
YOU GOT NO REASON TO BE SHY.

[chuckling]
YOU KNOW?

01:39:23.458 --> 01:39:26.875
IT'S THAT, LIKE, THE THING
YOU'RE MOST AFRAID OF IN LIFE,

01:39:26.875 --> 01:39:31.792
IF YOU DO IT, IF YOU STEP UP,
GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.

01:39:31.792 --> 01:39:35.458
YOU SEE A GIRL THAT YOU LIKE
THAT YOU'RE SCARED TO TALK TO,

01:39:35.458 --> 01:39:37.917
BRO, STEP UP.

01:39:37.917 --> 01:39:40.291
GO UP TO HER AND SAY:

01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:44.417
"HI, HOW ARE YOU TODAY?
NICE WEATHER WE'RE HAVING."
YOU KNOW, TAKE IT FROM THERE,

01:39:44.417 --> 01:39:47.291
WHEREVER THE CONVERSATION
GOES. ALL RIGHT, YOU TRY IT.

01:39:47.291 --> 01:39:50.083
TRY IT WITH ME.
PRACTICE. GO AHEAD.

01:39:50.083 --> 01:39:52.375
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

01:39:52.375 --> 01:39:55.875
TRY IT WITH ME.
GO AHEAD. JUST SAY IT.

01:39:55.875 --> 01:39:58.125
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

01:40:00.166 --> 01:40:02.625
COME ON.
HELLO. HELLO?

01:40:02.625 --> 01:40:04.125
HELLO.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.417
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:09.834
HOW--HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

01:40:09.834 --> 01:40:13.208
NICE WEATHER WE'RE HAVING.

01:40:16.125 --> 01:40:17.083
NICE WEATHER WE'RE HAVING.

01:40:17.083 --> 01:40:20.375
THERE YOU GO.
YOU SEE HOW HE DID IT?

01:40:20.375 --> 01:40:22.709
IT'S BECAUSE YOU
STEPPED UP, BRIAN.

01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:27.542
IF YOU'RE AFRAID,
STEP UP AND GOOD THINGS
START TO HAPPEN. AM I RIGHT?

01:40:27.542 --> 01:40:28.834
I STEPPED UP.

01:40:28.834 --> 01:40:30.875
STEP IT UP, PIMP.

01:40:30.875 --> 01:40:33.125
THAT'S HOW YOU DO.
STEP IT UP.

01:40:45.125 --> 01:40:48.166
SO, UH, NOW THAT WE'RE
PARTNERS IN CRIME,

01:40:48.166 --> 01:40:50.375
HOW ABOUT TELLING ME
YOUR REAL NAME?

01:40:52.875 --> 01:40:55.125
THE REASON
THAT I ASK THAT

01:40:55.125 --> 01:40:58.667
IS BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU GAVE IT ANY THOUGHT
SINCE LAST NIGHT,

01:40:58.667 --> 01:41:00.208

THINKING ABOUT IT.

YOU KNOW,

NOW WE'RE BOTH
GONNA BE LEAVING.

OUT THERE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.
