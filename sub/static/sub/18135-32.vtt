00:28.528 --> 00:31.530
I've seen camels with more
giddy up and go.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.999
Gonna miss the whole
super-kerfuffle.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.767
Better off walking there.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.536
Hey bud, you forgot to pay!

00:37.571 --> 00:40.439
Me pay you?
You should pay me!

00:40.474 --> 00:43.642
For making me late for
the story of the year!

Hey, Deputy donut shop.

00:53.153 --> 00:55.687
Sid Sharp from
the <i> Daily Planet.</i>

00:55.722 --> 00:58.090
Cut to the chase!
What's the low down here?

00:58.125 --> 01:00.725
I already gave the other guy
from the <i> Planet</i> my statement.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.160
Why don't you go ask him?

01:02.195 --> 01:06.064
No, no, no, not him,
not again!

01:06.099 --> 01:07.833
You poaching my story, Kent?

01:07.868 --> 01:10.302
Uh, hey, Sid!
What do you mean by poaching?

01:10.337 --> 01:11.770
I've been here
for 20 minutes already.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.840
How? I just ran here
as soon as it hit the wire.

01:14.875 --> 01:18.677
I've got my sources.
Maybe next time, Sid.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.812
Yeah, next time you'll find
my boot in your...

01:20.847 --> 01:22.081
CLARK: What was that?

01:23.450 --> 01:24.349
Nothing!

01:24.384 --> 01:25.917
You're hearing things, Clark.

01:25.952 --> 01:29.088
Next time you get new glasses,
check your hearing too.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.559
Why would two big gangsters
have alien weaponry?

01:34.594 --> 01:36.495
I'm sure it wasn't
just to rob a bank.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.197
Apokolips seems like
the obvious answer.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.767
I'll have to analyze it
back at the watch tower.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.402
SID: <i> How does he do it?</i>

01:44.437 --> 01:46.605
Every time there's
a story about Superman,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.807
Kent is there with the scoop.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.041
Well, Mr. Sharp.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.610
Superman and Clark
are friends, so,

01:51.645 --> 01:53.478
anytime there's some action
in Metropolis,

01:53.513 --> 01:55.447
I'm sure Sup's
just give him a ring.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.449
(MOCKINGLY) I'm sure he just
gives him a...

01:57.484 --> 01:58.450
Hey!

01:58.485 --> 02:00.285
You're a genius, Olson.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.621
Hah! I don't care
what they say about you.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.189
Wait, what do they say
about me?

02:04.224 --> 02:05.624
Look, Kent first made a name

02:05.659 --> 02:07.492
reporting on that
flying boy scout.

02:07.527 --> 02:10.795
What I need, is my own
super meal ticket.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.364
Great Caesar's ghost!

02:12.399 --> 02:14.232
Great Caesar's ghost?

02:14.267 --> 02:18.103
That's a terrible name,
it's Doctor Scoop.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.072
Sid, are you out of your mind?

02:21.107 --> 02:22.174
Now, you think about it.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.508
The <i> Daily Planet</i>
will have access

02:23.543 --> 02:25.877
to its own personal
superhero, me!

02:25.912 --> 02:28.246
And I'll be there
to report it all.

02:28.281 --> 02:30.649
Even if I did recognize your
true genius,

02:30.684 --> 02:32.517
you're forgetting
one key ingredient!

02:32.552 --> 02:35.453
You're not a superhero,
you blockhead!

DARKSEID:

02:39.226 --> 02:42.761

02:42.796 --> 02:46.464
Who among you will succeed,
where the humans have failed?

02:46.499 --> 02:47.866
Surely, the Kryptonian

02:47.901 --> 02:50.769
is no match for your
most devoted acolytes.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.637
Desaad, Kanto,

02:52.672 --> 02:56.875
and your own
savage son, Kalibak.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.711
I have already located
the Kryptonian,

02:59.746 --> 03:02.013
in the structure
the humans call

03:02.048 --> 03:03.815
the <i> Daily Planet.</i>

03:03.850 --> 03:06.818
Allow me to dispatch a team
of para-demons

03:06.853 --> 03:09.287
to retrieve
this caped nuisance.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.323
DARKSEID: Very well, Desaad.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.291
I want the Kryptonian
back here,

03:13.326 --> 03:16.795
where I will deal
with him, otherwise,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.931
I will deal with you.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.170
(BEEPING)

03:25.205 --> 03:26.571
Clark here.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.540
I finished my analysis
of the alien weaponry.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.542
It's definitely
from Apokolips.

03:30.577 --> 03:31.944
I'll be right there.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.552
Can't you see I'm changing
in here?

03:41.087 --> 03:42.187

04:23.363 --> 04:25.830
Sid was just abducted
by Darkseid's goons.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.999
Looks like Superman's gonna
have to go to Apokolips

04:28.034 --> 04:29.034
to save him.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.037

isn't even the man of oatmeal.

Superman's my pal.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.955
He's gonna be upset,
you kidnapped me.

04:50.990 --> 04:54.526
You stand with Kal-El
of Krypton?

04:54.561 --> 04:57.395
If that's who you call
Superman, then yes.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.030
Sorry, it's hard
to understand you.

04:59.065 --> 05:02.000
Got some phlegm in your throat
or something?

05:02.035 --> 05:04.903
You dare mock a god
of Apokolips!

05:04.938 --> 05:07.872
Just saying,
team ugly over here
might have a better shot

05:07.907 --> 05:09.240
at following orders.

05:09.275 --> 05:12.043
If they could understand you!

05:12.078 --> 05:14.245
Mother say I very handsome.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.680
Enough!

05:15.715 --> 05:19.284
If this flotsam will
draw the Kryptonian to us,

05:19.319 --> 05:21.820
then he shall live.

05:21.855 --> 05:25.590
Long enough to see his friend
walk into our trap.

BATMAN:
According to our scanners,

05:30.029 --> 05:33.765
the boom tube originated from
inside Darkseid's throne room.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.400
Getting in will be
easy enough.

05:35.435 --> 05:36.735
It's getting him out
that will be tricky.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.371
This Sid Sharp,
he's a friend of yours?

05:39.406 --> 05:41.206
He's...

05:41.241 --> 05:42.908
Someone who needs my help.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.684

05:53.820 --> 05:54.819
Sid Sharp?

05:54.854 --> 05:56.421

06:22.048 --> 06:23.114
(GRUNTS)

06:23.149 --> 06:25.150

while I tell Lord Darkseid

06:30.657 --> 06:32.391
about our victory.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.996
I never dreamed you three
could be as dim-witted

06:38.031 --> 06:39.664
as you are revolting.

06:39.699 --> 06:43.101
You're just going
to let him waltz out
and take credit like that?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.903
The Earthling has a point.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.205
Why should Kanto receive
the glory?

06:47.240 --> 06:51.242
True, Kalibak was hoping
for a big hug from Father.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.944
Don't just stand there,
go get him!

06:55.415 --> 06:56.781
KANTO: What madness is this?

06:56.816 --> 06:59.217
You dare lay your hands
on Kanto?

06:59.252 --> 07:02.987
Before Superman got here,
I heard Mr. Mustache say

07:03.022 --> 07:04.122
that if the plan failed,

07:04.157 --> 07:06.291
he's gonna blame it
on you two dummies.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.092
Is that true, Kanto?

07:08.127 --> 07:10.528
You would believe
the Earthling over a member

07:10.563 --> 07:12.497
of Darkseid's Elite?

07:12.532 --> 07:14.599
Actually, now that I think
about it,

07:14.634 --> 07:17.669
Hoody over here was the one
who said it.

07:17.704 --> 07:21.206
Desaad used dirty tricks.

07:21.241 --> 07:24.409
Surely, this is just
the Earthling's ploy to...

07:24.444 --> 07:26.544
He hasn't the wit to lie,
Desaad.

07:26.579 --> 07:29.481
Enough, all of you!

07:29.516 --> 07:31.082
Bring me the Kryptonian.

07:31.117 --> 07:35.420
Before I turn
all four of you into ash.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.689
Almost ready.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.924
As you see, Lord Darkseid,

07:39.959 --> 07:43.561
our trap worked,
and this Superman is now ours.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.831
I mean, yours.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.433
I expected more.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.702
From the last son of Krypton.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.705
Yeah, big chief stone face,
you let him have it.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.174
You had one job,
big blue cheese,

07:56.209 --> 07:58.109
and you blew it!

07:58.144 --> 07:59.811
Ha. Some rescue...

07:59.846 --> 08:02.247
-I'll say this
about the Earth people.
-...took your sweet time...

-They always keep things
interesting.
-...man of tomorrow.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.317
They should call you the man
of how about,

08:06.352 --> 08:08.319
sometime next week!

08:08.354 --> 08:10.388
Sorry I disappointed you, Sid.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.224
Maybe you can
make it up to me.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.232
Father!

08:27.540 --> 08:28.840
He's mine.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.642
Not if I have anything to say
about it.

This mean no hug?

09:56.462 --> 09:57.662
Hmm.

09:59.499 --> 10:02.734
And then Superman was like,
it's up to you, Sid.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.103
And I was like,
but you're Superman.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.170
And he said,

10:06.205 --> 10:08.373
you're the Superman now.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.909
(CHUCKLES) Come on now, Sid,
he didn't say that.

was there, sunstroke?

there's no need to worry.
