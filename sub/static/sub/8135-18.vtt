00:00.967 --> 00:04.528
That isn't Jim Litton in there.

00:04.604 --> 00:07.232
I don't know who or what
is inside him.

00:11.277 --> 00:13.245
Hey!

00:13.313 --> 00:16.771
- KITT, I think that man
needs some help.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.684
- What's going on around here?
- The animals are more friendly than people are.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.955
Bonnie, come on. Wake up.
We gotta get outta here.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:42.709 --> 00:46.805
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.905
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:06.493 --> 02:11.954
Michael, I hope it won't be much longer. This dirt is
beginning to clog a few of my more sensitive instruments.

02:12.031 --> 02:14.090
We're almost there, buddy.

02:14.167 --> 02:18.729
And it isn't just dirt: It's the stuff
of ancient Indian civilizations.

02:18.805 --> 02:24.300
Perhaps, but the stuff of ancient Indian
civilizations is wreaking havoc on my turbo.

02:24.377 --> 02:27.676
Sorry, KITT.
Devon said it was urgent.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.682
"County Museum,
Archeological Site Number 32."

02:41.227 --> 02:44.025
According to my visuals, Michael,
that's Dr. Litton.

02:45.565 --> 02:48.500
Hey! Wonder what's wrong
with him?

02:54.908 --> 02:58.901
Dr. Litton!
I'm Michael Knight from the Foundation!

02:58.978 --> 03:01.037
You called Devon Miles?

03:05.118 --> 03:07.643
KITT, I think that man needs some help.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.389
Take over
and keep her real steady, huh?

03:16.462 --> 03:18.191
Of course, Michael.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.069
Be careful, Michael.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.322
No. No! No!

03:48.394 --> 03:52.228
It's okay. I'm Michael Knight.
Devon Miles sent me.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.167
It's okay.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.946
- What's wrong with him, Michael?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.952
Take over.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.458
His blood pressure is
200 over 140.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.435
This man is in extreme danger.

04:33.373 --> 04:36.171
I detect the presence
of a very potent drug.

04:38.344 --> 04:42.007
Unknown? What do you mean "unknown?" I
thought you knew every drug known to mankind...

04:42.081 --> 04:44.208
three thousand
or something like that.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.310
5,875, to be exact,

04:47.387 --> 04:50.220
and I have records of
each chemical within the drug.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.020
But, this particular combination
of chemicals is unknown.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.892
All right, let's get him
to the hospital.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.730
Professor Deauville should be here
at any second.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.470
Devon, I've never seen you so excited.

05:11.544 --> 05:15.344
It's not every day one is inducted
into so prestigious a society as Helios.

05:15.415 --> 05:19.374
Why is it that when one
is in a hurry,

05:19.452 --> 05:21.818
one's tie never seems to go right?

05:21.888 --> 05:26.552
I think it's called "Devon's
First Law of Nervousness." Oh.

05:26.626 --> 05:29.117
Is that all right?
Perfect.

05:29.195 --> 05:34.861
Bonnie, I'm so pleased that you're here
to share this moment with me.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.095
I only wish that Michael
was here too.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.905
Professor Deauville, hello.
Hello. Hello, again.

05:44.977 --> 05:46.968
This way, please.
Thank you.

05:47.046 --> 05:51.039
My dear Graham, how very nice to see
you. You're looking well, my friend.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.051
And you.

05:53.119 --> 05:57.453
Of course, it's always a pleasure to be
face-to-face with your beauty, my dear.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.684
Won't you sit down?
Yes.

05:59.759 --> 06:04.594
Uh, Devon, I have something
important to discuss.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.224
The results of the test.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.463
Oh, yes, the Helios scores.
Of course.

06:10.536 --> 06:14.632
You didn't grade mine, did you?
I just took it to keep Devon company.

06:14.707 --> 06:20.111
Well, as you know, the Helios test is
not merely an entrance examination.

06:20.179 --> 06:25.378
It is widely acknowledged as the most
accurate measure of innate intelligence.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.646
It scores not only mental ability,

06:27.720 --> 06:31.588
but the capacity to grasp
higher planes of thought...

06:31.657 --> 06:36.356
which are used to solve
the most urgent problems of our world.

06:36.429 --> 06:41.594
So, I'm very pleased to announce
our newest Helios member,

06:42.969 --> 06:45.335
Miss Barstow.

06:48.341 --> 06:53.005
- Are you sure?
- We at Helios do not make mistakes.

06:54.847 --> 06:57.247
- Congratulations, Bonnie.
- I don't know what to say.

06:57.316 --> 07:02.151
There will be an induction ceremony
over the weekend at the estate.

07:02.221 --> 07:05.850
You will attend, of course.
Oh, and uh, Devon,

07:05.925 --> 07:08.758
I'm also pleased to announce...

07:08.828 --> 07:13.629
that in recognition of your years
of devotion and support,

07:13.699 --> 07:15.690
we're making you an honorary member.

07:15.768 --> 07:20.432
An honorary member? Thank you.
I'm very pleased.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.942
Permit me.

07:25.011 --> 07:28.037
Hello.

07:29.715 --> 07:32.878
- Michael, where are you?
- I'm at Physician's Hospital.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.113
Look, I got some bad news.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.055
When I found Dr. Litton,
he was having some kind of fit.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.821
He's a in a coma now.
The doctors don't know anything yet.

07:41.894 --> 07:46.456
Devon, there's some kind of drug in his
system. KITT doesn't have any record of it.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.365
Thank you, Michael.
I'll be there right away.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.130
I'm afraid there's bad news.
What?

07:51.204 --> 07:55.903
- Jim Litton. He's in a coma.
- Oh, my God.

07:57.610 --> 08:02.775
The reason I came to see you, Devon,
is that in the past month...

08:02.849 --> 08:06.842
two of our Helios members have died...

08:06.919 --> 08:08.853
mysteriously.

08:19.966 --> 08:23.129
Jim and I go all the way back
to Princeton together.

08:24.303 --> 08:29.798
I remember one professor in particular,
Dr. Whitehead, took us on a dig...

08:29.876 --> 08:33.333
and he told us that, uh,
all this folklore about Indian gods...

08:33.412 --> 08:37.405
protecting their graves
was just superstition.

08:37.482 --> 08:41.919
Well, one night Jim and I covered
our bodies in mud and feathers...

08:41.988 --> 08:46.322
and put on hideous masks
and sneaked into Dr. Whitehead's tent.

08:46.392 --> 08:50.385
I've never seen a man so frightened,
nor run as hard.

08:50.463 --> 08:54.797
Excuse me. Here it is. Oh, well...

08:54.867 --> 08:58.860
You know, last year's find of
the Aztec gold...

08:58.938 --> 09:02.874
just outside Mexico City,
was Jim's biggest triumph.

09:02.942 --> 09:06.105
Apart from the intrinsic value
of the gold,

09:06.178 --> 09:10.512
the historical worth of it
is inestimable.

09:10.583 --> 09:14.212
Now, to think of Jim Litton like this...

09:14.287 --> 09:16.551
at the peak of his career.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.963
Jim. Jim.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.163
- No!
- It's me, Graham.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.900
No! No!

09:34.974 --> 09:37.465
You'd better leave.

09:42.148 --> 09:45.311
That isn't Jim Litton in there.

09:45.384 --> 09:49.821
I-I don't know who
or what is inside him,

09:49.889 --> 09:52.380
but that is not the Jim I know.

09:54.660 --> 09:59.290
- I-I hate to ask such a big favor...
- Anything, Graham. Anything we can do.

09:59.365 --> 10:04.200
Come to Helios this weekend.
Find out whoever's responsible.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.966
Excuse me, why do you think
it's someone from Helios?

10:07.039 --> 10:10.531
I don't know what to think.

10:10.610 --> 10:15.946
But if it isn't someone from inside
our organization, I'm at a total loss.

10:16.015 --> 10:19.178
We'll be happy to come. We'll
do whatever we can. Thank you.

11:43.202 --> 11:47.696
It's amazing.
I mean, this place way out here.

11:47.773 --> 11:53.109
It's beautiful.
I can't believe it.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.671
I've always dreamed of
belonging to something like this.

11:56.749 --> 12:02.085
Helios is a fine organization, Bonnie.
They made an excellent decision.

12:02.154 --> 12:05.317
I'm proud of you.
Thank you.

12:06.492 --> 12:10.724
I'm sure if you took the test again...
Oh, no. It's not of any importance.

12:10.796 --> 12:15.790
Really. It's just that I was, um,
a bit surprised, that's all.

12:15.868 --> 12:18.860
Well, this wouldn't be the same
if you were upset.

12:18.938 --> 12:22.430
And anyways, it's not as though
you've been left out.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.999
You're an honorary member.

12:39.859 --> 12:42.851
Thank you so much
for coming, my friends.

12:42.928 --> 12:46.261
I hope we're not late.
Oh, no, no, no.

12:46.332 --> 12:49.961
We would never begin
without our loveliest new member.

12:54.173 --> 12:57.665
And Helios, the Greek sun god,
the god of brilliance,

12:57.743 --> 13:00.371
rode to his palace
in a chariot of gold.

13:00.446 --> 13:04.712
- Kind of like a Rolls-Royce, right?
- I fail to see the logic of that statement.

13:04.784 --> 13:09.312
- Forget it.
- Had you used a more domestic brand as your model...

13:09.388 --> 13:13.552
KITT, I said forget it.
It's just a figure of speech.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.528
By the way, you run a scan on
the data banks Bonnie added on Helios?

13:17.596 --> 13:22.898
Yes, I did. I find no connection between Dr.
Litton and the two, deceased Helios members.

13:22.968 --> 13:27.496
- No connection? - By the way, Michael,
can a Rolls-Royce do computer scans?

13:27.573 --> 13:32.033
Not a one. And believe me,
you are as good as gold to me.

13:32.111 --> 13:36.138
Thank you.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.288
Who do you think that is?
A good question, Michael.

13:51.297 --> 13:54.960
This estate is huge. The
grounds seem to be extensive.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.968
They do go on forever.

14:02.141 --> 14:05.133
Why do you think this place
is in such a secluded area?

14:05.211 --> 14:09.204
I don't know, KITT, but with a little
snooping around, I might find some answers.

14:09.281 --> 14:11.613
Be careful, Michael.

14:17.323 --> 14:20.986
What you're about to see
will astound even you.

14:21.060 --> 14:25.258
This is truly one of
the engineering wonders of our time.

14:36.942 --> 14:42.107
In terms of speed, the question is
not how fast will this vehicle go,

14:42.181 --> 14:44.376
but how fast
do you wish it to go?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.751
As you know,
this is our missing link.

14:48.821 --> 14:52.882
All that remains is to separate
the car from its driver,

14:52.958 --> 14:57.952
a pleasant, but unremarkable young man
by the name of Michael Knight.

15:03.469 --> 15:07.963
The mansion was purchased in 1952
by the Helios trustees.

15:08.040 --> 15:12.374
Some of our members live on the premises
while working on projects and studies.

15:12.444 --> 15:15.936
Oh, did you know that
this one was done by...

15:16.015 --> 15:18.745
the famous Genoan artist,
Renaldo Sofo?

15:18.817 --> 15:22.116
It took him 12 years to
complete it. That's amazing.

15:22.187 --> 15:25.179
Well, 12 years is a long time...

15:25.257 --> 15:28.420
Uh, my name is, uh,
Irving Farber.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.657
You know, my notes on
the Renaissance are particularly stirring.

15:31.730 --> 15:35.996
Uh, I thought maybe we could get
together sometime and, um, discuss them.

15:37.503 --> 15:41.030
That...
It certainly sounds exciting.

15:41.106 --> 15:45.008
Irving. Irving. Irving. My
friends call me Irving Farber.

15:45.077 --> 15:48.444
Great. Okay. Uh, I
think we oughta be going.

15:48.514 --> 15:50.448
Okay, after you.

15:50.516 --> 15:55.010
He once remarked his own pets made his
life worthwhile for they were always loyal.

15:55.087 --> 15:59.922
Please follow me up these stairs. There are some
public areas that you might be interested in.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.129
Hi there.

16:14.139 --> 16:18.803
Michael, Dr. Litton is dead.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.675
He's dead? Yes, and the doctors
don't know what caused it.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.215
I've asked for an autopsy report
as soon as possible.

16:24.283 --> 16:29.482
Three dead men, no clues? The drug KITT
can't trace? What's going on around here?

16:29.555 --> 16:31.546
Have you discovered anything odd
or peculiar?

16:31.623 --> 16:34.490
Other than most of
the Helios members, no.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.824
They're not odd.
They're just different.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.887
Well, let's just say
this isn't my kind of place.

16:39.965 --> 16:42.297
Mm. I'm well aware of that, Michael.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.876
KITT, this place gives me the creeps.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.082
That elevator should be condemned.

17:18.936 --> 17:23.067
KITT, I got a combination lock here.
Can you open it?

17:23.142 --> 17:27.602
Certainly. I can also describe the make, model
and serial number of the device in question.

17:41.126 --> 17:44.118
You are a full-service car.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.644
I see you found our storeroom.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.918
That is our food distribution program
for the poor.

18:11.990 --> 18:15.517
The wealthy have an obligation to help
the less fortunate. Don't you agree?

18:15.594 --> 18:17.494
I do.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.865
Hey, nice jacket.
Oh, thank you.

18:30.943 --> 18:35.004
Well, look your best and you'll always
look best to her. Uh-oh, excuse me.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.947
Uh, Miss Barstow,
your outfit is very becoming.

18:38.016 --> 18:41.952
Fits you in all the right...
I mean, it's-it's very well tailored.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.012
- Would you care to, uh...
- Bonnie,

18:45.090 --> 18:47.490
KITT's electronic transformer's
been acting up, it's very bad.

18:47.559 --> 18:51.723
- Can we discuss it?
- Oh, we better. Excuse us.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.731
Uh, sure.

18:56.101 --> 19:00.629
- I do admire a woman of such dedication, don't you?
- Oh, well, yeah.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.637
Thanks for saving me.
I should thank you.

19:09.715 --> 19:13.549
I mean, after all, I didn't know whether
you'd still talk to me now that you're smart.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.144
Never stopped me before.
That's very funny.

19:17.222 --> 19:20.714
Excuse me.
Hold that. Thank you.

19:22.728 --> 19:27.722
Was that gentlemanly?
What a guy. A real sport.

19:27.799 --> 19:30.165
You know, I...

19:34.173 --> 19:39.236
Hello again. I suppose
congratulations are in order.

19:40.279 --> 19:43.271
You're an inductee, aren't
you? No, no. I'm just a guest.

19:43.348 --> 19:47.842
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, actually, you
don't look like a Helios member to me.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.753
Really? I should take that
as a compliment.

19:50.822 --> 19:53.814
I'm Dr. Charlene Hanover.
Michael Knight.

19:53.892 --> 19:58.852
You're the man who helped Dr.
Litton. Yeah. Did you know him?

19:58.931 --> 20:03.925
My field is also archaeology.
I visited him at the dig.

20:04.002 --> 20:07.199
Quite a large dig, considering.
What do you mean? Considering what?

20:14.580 --> 20:17.208
Yeah, KITT,
what is it?

20:17.282 --> 20:22.652
Michael, my sensors have picked up some animal cries
coming from a room at the far end of the mansion.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.586
Thanks, pal.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.830
Hi.
How you doing?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.832
Okay.

20:54.219 --> 20:57.347
Oh, hi, little guy.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.353
Oh, hi.
Um, I'm just looking around.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.692
You know, the party's kind of dull.

21:05.764 --> 21:10.030
Sometimes the animals are more friendly
than people are.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.833
Yeah. Yeah, they are.
But, you know, they make rotten dancers.

21:15.073 --> 21:17.837
Well, I'll see you later.
Thank you.

21:25.784 --> 21:30.448
Bonnie, this is Peter Stark. He will
show you our laboratory facilities.

21:30.522 --> 21:34.185
I trust you will find them most
interesting. I'm sure I will.

21:34.259 --> 21:36.557
I know you will.

21:53.078 --> 21:58.072
An elusive woman scientist.
Three dead men. A secret storeroom.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.812
An experimental lab with animals.

22:00.886 --> 22:04.413
Michael, something strange
is going on here.

22:04.489 --> 22:08.983
I know exactly what you mean, KITT.
And it all started at Dr. Litton's dig site.

22:10.062 --> 22:13.395
Michael, this dig site must be
filled with ancient artifacts.

22:15.233 --> 22:17.224
Okay, KITT.

22:17.302 --> 22:21.238
Let's see what Dr. Charlene Hanover
seems so mysterious about.

22:41.660 --> 22:45.721
I detect a large pit and sizable deposits
of fresh earth inside.

22:50.035 --> 22:53.402
Speaking of artifacts, Michael,
I believe I just ran over one.

23:11.757 --> 23:14.590
KITT, it's gotta be
hundreds of years old.

23:14.659 --> 23:18.322
- I could date it for you if you like.
- Yeah, why not.

23:20.832 --> 23:24.427
Here you go.

23:24.503 --> 23:27.404
Michael, this fragment
is less than a month old.

23:27.472 --> 23:29.963
A month old?

23:32.978 --> 23:34.912
Sure doesn't look it.

23:40.318 --> 23:42.650
KITT, this thing must have been
planted here.

23:42.721 --> 23:46.122
But Dr. Litton was
a world-renowned archaeologist.

23:46.191 --> 23:50.093
Yeah, I know. I know. He wouldn't
be involved in something like this.

23:50.162 --> 23:54.326
- Then who do you think is?
- I don't know.

23:54.399 --> 23:56.890
That's a real good question.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.902
Who and why?

24:32.137 --> 24:37.074
All right, KITT. I need a boost
about 25 feet... straight up.

24:37.142 --> 24:41.408
Michael, you are an invited guest.
May I suggest the front door?

24:41.480 --> 24:45.644
No, not this time. This time I
wanna visit without anybody knowing.

24:51.756 --> 24:53.690
All right, let's go for it.

24:59.998 --> 25:03.161
- Thanks, KITT.
- Anytime.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.832
Dr. James Litton.

26:12.837 --> 26:14.771
"Bonnie Barstow."

26:16.241 --> 26:18.334
"Fail?" That's strange.

26:39.864 --> 26:41.764
KITT?

27:02.754 --> 27:06.656
KITT, I don't know exactly what's going on around
here, but I don't like it. You know where Bonnie is?

27:08.259 --> 27:11.695
My sensors detect Bonnie
on the second floor in the south wing.

27:11.763 --> 27:15.756
And Michael, hurry. The sun's rising,
and everyone will be up soon.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.981
- KITT, get the door.
- There is a guard inside.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.353
Get rid of him, KITT.

27:39.424 --> 27:41.551
All right.

28:00.912 --> 28:02.903
Bonnie. Bonnie.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.749
KITT, meet me at the door
in exactly 30 seconds.

28:05.817 --> 28:08.877
I'm on my way.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.184
Bonnie, come on. Wake up.
We gotta get out of here.

28:13.258 --> 28:15.419
Come on. Come on.
Let's go.

29:00.004 --> 29:02.837
Michael, go back.
What?

29:17.021 --> 29:19.353
Come on.
It's Michael.

29:19.424 --> 29:23.155
Be quiet.
KITT, pull over to the front.

29:23.228 --> 29:27.164
Bonnie, I agree with Michael. This is
highly irregular and disconcerting.

29:27.232 --> 29:32.329
It's okay, KITT.
Trust me. I'll explain later.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.894
Better listen to her, KITT.

29:44.916 --> 29:47.476
Good work, my dear.
Excellent.

29:47.552 --> 29:53.184
You see, Mr. Knight, in addition to highly
toxic, untraceable drugs that can kill,

29:53.258 --> 29:57.456
we've also perfected chemicals
that control the mind.

30:00.431 --> 30:01.830
Come.

30:20.351 --> 30:22.683
Normally, I wouldn't do this.

30:22.754 --> 30:26.246
But, since you won't be around
to reveal our master plan,

30:26.324 --> 30:29.987
I think it only fitting
that you behold its brilliance.

30:30.061 --> 30:32.188
You see, the truth of our time...

30:32.263 --> 30:36.359
is that nuclear holocaust
is inevitable.

30:36.434 --> 30:40.200
Perhaps not tomorrow.
Perhaps not next week, but someday.

30:40.271 --> 30:45.334
Common wisdom has it
that if there are survivors,

30:45.410 --> 30:47.605
the nuclear aftermath
will further decimate the population.

30:47.679 --> 30:52.810
But, those who think that
this is a matter of random survival,

30:52.884 --> 30:54.852
have quite forgotten their Darwin.

30:54.919 --> 31:00.255
- You're insane.
- No, not insane.

31:00.325 --> 31:03.488
Advanced intelligence.

31:04.996 --> 31:08.454
And who better to survive than
the most intelligent people on the Earth.

31:10.802 --> 31:14.101
An underground city.

31:14.172 --> 31:19.838
It was our perfect cover until poor James
Litton started to nose around...

31:19.911 --> 31:22.539
and get suspicious.

31:22.614 --> 31:27.051
Why have you done this to Bonnie?
What can you possibly want from her?

31:27.118 --> 31:29.746
KITT.

31:32.023 --> 31:36.722
You see, that car will make
an impossible crime impossibly easy.

31:38.329 --> 31:40.797
Does it surprise you that...

31:40.865 --> 31:44.323
we have devised the perfect crime
to finance our project?

31:44.402 --> 31:46.802
Coming from you,
nothing surprises me.

31:46.871 --> 31:50.363
Good. Then we understand each other.

31:52.143 --> 31:57.274
You see, we have already excavated
one-quarter of our city under the present dig.

31:57.348 --> 32:01.512
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but you can't use the car.

32:01.586 --> 32:05.647
- KITT's programmed to take orders from me.
- Peter, take care of Mr. Knight.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.145
You have everything you need,
my dear?

33:13.658 --> 33:17.890
Yes, Professor Deauville.
Good. Then let us begin.

33:21.132 --> 33:23.532
Wait, what are you doing?
Hey, wait a minute!

33:23.601 --> 33:27.230
Hey, hold it!

33:35.113 --> 33:37.513
I think this is what you want,
Professor Deauville.

33:41.686 --> 33:46.248
The entire operation should take
no more than 17 minutes. Excellent.

33:46.324 --> 33:50.818
Bonnie, you said you'd explain
about Michael. Where is he?

33:50.895 --> 33:53.386
He...

33:53.464 --> 33:55.932
- kind of went underground.
- Underground?

33:56.000 --> 33:58.525
I have no record
of such a mission.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.939
Bonnie?

34:55.993 --> 34:58.257
KITT! KITT, where are you?

35:08.439 --> 35:10.339
Give it up, Stark!

35:31.562 --> 35:34.690
Now, the security system.

35:34.765 --> 35:38.292
Bonnie, I hesitate to bring this up again, but
I've done a complete search of my records...

35:38.369 --> 35:41.463
and still find no record
of Michael's underground mission.

35:42.874 --> 35:45.342
It's all right, KITT.
I can fix that.

35:48.379 --> 35:51.906
Bonnie. Bonnie?
I still cannot find...

35:51.983 --> 35:55.851
I have no record...

35:55.920 --> 35:57.717
Of Michael's...

35:57.788 --> 36:00.348
of Michael's...

36:44.635 --> 36:48.435
Hey, Stark,
looks like you're stuck in there, huh?

36:49.707 --> 36:51.641
KITT?

36:53.144 --> 36:55.635
KITT?

36:55.713 --> 36:57.772
KITT, can you hear me?

36:57.848 --> 36:59.873
Play back the plan, please.

36:59.951 --> 37:04.820
I am to assist in the removal of the
Aztec gold from the County Museum.

37:06.991 --> 37:09.983
With my microwave jammers
and surveillance capabilities,

37:10.061 --> 37:15.192
phase two with the County Museum should
take no more than one minute and 10 seconds.

37:15.266 --> 37:18.793
Once the Aztec gold is reached,
phase three will commence.

37:18.869 --> 37:23.169
Once secured and melted down, the gold
at current international prices...

37:23.241 --> 37:25.903
will be worth $25.7 million.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.876
Hey! Hey! Stop!

37:54.505 --> 37:59.841
There's still no word from Stark. Well,
we can't wait any longer. Let us begin.

38:22.266 --> 38:24.427
Hey!

38:24.502 --> 38:27.699
Hey! Stop! Stop!

38:27.772 --> 38:30.605
Hey, Charlene, stop!

38:34.879 --> 38:39.248
Thanks for stopping. Look, we
gotta get back to Helios right away.

38:39.317 --> 38:43.515
Helios? No.
I won't go back there.

38:43.587 --> 38:45.851
Deauville's brainwashed Bonnie.
Now they're using my car.

38:45.923 --> 38:48.084
They're planning on using it
for some kind of robbery.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.686
It's too late. They've already
gone. Where were they going?

38:51.762 --> 38:54.253
Where were they going?
Listen to me!

38:54.332 --> 38:58.029
They got Bonnie. They drugged her. Now,
please! Help me! You don't understand!

38:58.102 --> 39:03.870
He's mad! If he finds out I helped you,
he'll kill me, just like he killed the others.

39:03.941 --> 39:09.504
All right. I'm sorry. There's no time left.
Please, tell me, where were they going?

39:13.050 --> 39:15.883
The County Museum. All right.
That's where we're going.

39:15.953 --> 39:18.786
Now, either you drive or I drive.
It's up to you.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.080
Come on. Come on.

40:47.745 --> 40:51.704
- Phase one, KITT.
- Very well, Bonnie.

41:03.527 --> 41:06.519
Primary security system
deactivation completed.

41:16.640 --> 41:20.076
Auxiliary security system
deactivation completed.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.305
Now the locks, KITT.
Phase two.

41:27.952 --> 41:30.216
Phase two completed.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.988
Let's go.

41:46.971 --> 41:49.269
Call the police.

41:58.482 --> 42:02.748
Kill Michael Knight, KITT.
Kill him!

42:11.262 --> 42:14.390
No, KITT. You're mine.

42:14.465 --> 42:17.923
- I have my orders.
- You're my car, KITT.

42:18.002 --> 42:21.597
I obey Graham Deauville.
What does KITT stand for?

42:21.672 --> 42:25.938
It's the Knight Industry Two Thousand.

42:26.010 --> 42:29.878
- I know that because
you're my car.

42:29.947 --> 42:32.279
You obey me.

42:32.349 --> 42:35.682
You've been programmed
to obey me.

42:35.753 --> 42:38.620
Tell him, Bonnie.
That's right, KITT.

42:39.857 --> 42:43.816
No, that's not right.
I'm Michael Knight.

42:43.894 --> 42:49.059
You are the Knight Industry Two Thousand!
You are my car! You belong to me!

42:49.133 --> 42:54.435
- KITT.
- I have my orders. I obey Graham Deauville.

42:54.505 --> 42:58.407
Then you're gonna have to
kill me to stop me.

42:59.977 --> 43:04.414
I obey Graham Deauville.

43:06.483 --> 43:09.247
I obey Graham Deauville.

43:12.022 --> 43:14.115
I obey...

43:14.191 --> 43:18.127
Graham...

43:18.195 --> 43:20.527
Deauville.

43:24.201 --> 43:26.965
I can't kill you, Michael.
You know that.

43:27.037 --> 43:29.505
I was counting on that, pal.

43:31.442 --> 43:34.434
You made one big mistake, Deauville.

43:34.511 --> 43:38.003
KITT was programmed
never, ever to take a human life.

43:40.017 --> 43:42.212
Stop, Michael.
Bonnie, it's all over.

43:42.286 --> 43:45.016
We work together. We're a team.
You and me and Devon and KITT. No.

43:45.089 --> 43:48.855
Now, listen to me.
We work together to help people.

43:48.926 --> 43:52.293
Not to hurt 'em.
Take my hand, Bonnie.

43:54.198 --> 43:57.895
Remember the Foundation?
Remember Devon? Remember me?

43:59.436 --> 44:02.496
We're a team.

44:02.573 --> 44:04.302
We love each other.

44:07.044 --> 44:10.844
Yeah, that-a-girl.

44:10.914 --> 44:13.678
Okay. It's all over now.

44:16.854 --> 44:19.846
It's okay. It's okay.

44:19.923 --> 44:22.915
Go get Devon.
Go call Devon on the phone.

44:29.299 --> 44:31.961
Let's go, KITT.
I'm with you, Michael.

44:53.323 --> 44:57.384
How ya doing, pal?
Just like old times.

45:16.780 --> 45:18.714
Michael, he's trying to
cut us off.

45:21.018 --> 45:22.986
Let's go, pal.
Let's go skiing, huh?

45:26.690 --> 45:29.181
Whoo!

45:39.570 --> 45:42.505
Hang onto your hat.

46:42.933 --> 46:45.094
What's this?

46:46.270 --> 46:49.296
This is eggs, scrambled.

46:51.275 --> 46:53.641
Toast, light.

46:53.710 --> 46:58.204
Juice, fresh. Strawberries
and cream. Devon's idea.

46:58.282 --> 47:00.716
- And the single, yellow rose?
- Michael's idea.

47:00.784 --> 47:04.515
Auto News?
My idea, Bonnie. Hope you like it.

47:04.588 --> 47:07.079
I love it, KITT.
It's just what I need.

47:07.157 --> 47:09.819
KITT's been nice to me all morning.
I think he feels guilty.

47:09.893 --> 47:13.329
Michael, guilt is an emotional...
A human response.

47:13.397 --> 47:16.560
However, I could order you
a subscription of Automotive Today too.

47:16.633 --> 47:21.093
That's okay. Oh, by the way. I forgot.
I found this in the Helios file.

47:21.171 --> 47:26.234
Oh, what's this?
It's the results of my test. I passed!

47:26.310 --> 47:29.939
I think this should be yours.

47:30.013 --> 47:32.675
Oh, what's that?
The Helios pin.

47:32.749 --> 47:35.183
Thank you, Bonnie. Hey! Pretty good.

47:35.252 --> 47:37.152
What a good idea.
Wait a minute.

47:37.221 --> 47:39.382
These are really fresh.
Wait.

47:58.408 --> 48:03.072
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

48:03.146 --> 48:05.307
the world of the Knight Rider.
