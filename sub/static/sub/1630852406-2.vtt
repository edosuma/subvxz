01:21.289 --> 01:22.165
<i>Jian.</i>

01:23.166 --> 01:26.920
Do you see those dark spots?

01:27.545 --> 01:30.381
It's called "The Silent Sea."

03:18.489 --> 03:22.744
THREE STORAGES

03:27.165 --> 03:29.834
Captain, we need to switch out
our life support system.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.087
<i>Connect to life support system</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

03:45.433 --> 03:46.893
Man, that feels much better.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.485
I thought I was really going to die.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.198
Are we all doing okay?

04:00.281 --> 04:01.366
Fuck, finally.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.953
Begin the pressurization.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.800
AIR LOCK AIR PRESSURE
AIR LOCK GRAVITY LEVEL

04:36.025 --> 04:37.402
PRESSURE, GRAVITY MATCHED

04:53.835 --> 04:55.253
We're going into the station.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.309
Let's restore power first.

05:09.392 --> 05:13.354
Let's get to the command center.
We'll find the main power supply there.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.666
Tell me if you feel dizzy or nauseated.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.127
-Okay.
-I can't feel my feet.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.054
What the hell did they do here? Fuck.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.181
Fuck. What the hell?

06:30.264 --> 06:32.183
-What's that?
-What is it?

06:34.143 --> 06:35.395
Everyone, step back.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.547
-Chief Gong.
-Yes, sir.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.591
Record the scene.
Report as soon as comms are back up.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.717
Yes, sir.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.637
E1. The scanner.

07:14.767 --> 07:19.021
There were a few attempts of breaking
and entering since the shutdown.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.816
His weapon and suit
suggests he's a mercenary.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.071
I don't think we could identify him.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.908
Doesn't it seem a little odd?

07:31.659 --> 07:33.369
It seems like he drowned to death.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.872
Drowned to death? Here?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.749
That makes no sense.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.376
That's why it's odd.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.797
But I see mucus foam
around his mouth and nose,

07:44.881 --> 07:46.757
and his lungs are swollen.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.261
Those are typical characteristics
of a drowned body.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.640
We'll know for sure after an autopsy.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.851
I'm jealous.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.936
I know he's a dead man,

07:59.020 --> 08:01.481
but at least he had
as much water as he wanted.

08:09.697 --> 08:10.656
Let's move.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.493
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.791
Where do you think
that dead man came from?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.671
The US? Russia?

09:06.754 --> 09:09.257
Maybe he's with RX.

09:10.174 --> 09:12.760
You mean that transnational corporation?

09:15.763 --> 09:16.973
What was the rest?

09:17.056 --> 09:18.266
Oh, the rest?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.187
That's it. RX.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.105
That's right.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.440
They've been messing
with every single country.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.859
They're like the resource Mafia.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.251
It's huge.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.337
I can't see the end of it.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.132
What did they do in here?

09:51.799 --> 09:53.718
Something that we don't know about.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.304
This station cost a fortune.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.432
This is weird.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.600
What's wrong?

10:01.851 --> 10:02.852
What is?

10:04.854 --> 10:07.106
-The radiation level.
-Isn't it odd?

10:07.189 --> 10:10.401
Isn't this at a normal level?
It's similar to other areas.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.487
I guess this wasn't the area
where radiation leaked.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.699
I know it'd vary depending
on the area, but this low?

10:16.782 --> 10:17.783
It's odd.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.453
What if the government report wasn't true?

10:22.038 --> 10:23.164
What do you mean?

10:23.247 --> 10:27.043
We don't know what kind of
radioactive substance killed the crew,

10:27.126 --> 10:29.170
or how it was leaked out and from where.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.922
Nothing has been revealed to this day.

10:32.006 --> 10:35.885
Are you suggesting that a radiation leak
may not be the cause of the accident?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.595
That's what the number says.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.514
And that man didn't look like

10:40.598 --> 10:44.101
he was killed due to radiation exposure.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.313
Is there a problem?

10:48.105 --> 10:50.941
The radiation level is at a normal range.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.569
And other detectors?

10:55.029 --> 10:57.657
They're the same.
It's not a problem with the detector.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.909
How far are we from the command center?

10:59.992 --> 11:03.871
You can use the staircase 20m to the north
and go down one level.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.917
Let's go. Our priority is
to reach the command center.

11:08.918 --> 11:09.919
Captain Han.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.632
There are too many oddities here.

11:16.050 --> 11:20.262
We must conduct an autopsy on that body
to find out the exact cause of his death.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.932
-Didn't you hear what I said?
-I did.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.101
The radiation level doesn't look right,

11:25.184 --> 11:27.478
and the cause of his death is uncertain.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.271
We cannot just let this go.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.149
I decide what our priority is.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.466
This place is huge.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.099
Let's see.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.476
CLOSED

12:09.603 --> 12:10.479
OPENED

12:10.563 --> 12:11.522
It worked.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.571
Wow. Look at that view.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.368
-E2, check the left side.
-Yes, sir.

12:25.953 --> 12:26.787
E1, this side.

12:26.871 --> 12:27.747
Yes, sir.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.052
All clear on the left side.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.846
All clear, sir.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.350
All clear, sir.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.109
Look at all this equipment.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.194
Wow.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.864
I'll activate the main power supply.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.160
E1, E2, check the equipment.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.495
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.211
This is impressive.

13:16.003 --> 13:19.507
No wonder everyone was
talking about this place. It's huge.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.772
Captain. Communications are still down.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.275
They're probably looking for a way too.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.236
It'll take some time
for the rescue ship to arrive,

14:23.362 --> 14:24.613
so focus on our mission.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.614
Yes, Captain.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.201
All levels related to survival are fine.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.413
Radiation is at a normal level too.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.499
Even the supposedly
contaminated area seems fine too.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.587
If anything, the filter breakdown
was a big fat lie.

14:40.087 --> 14:43.465
Why did they shut down
this perfectly fine station?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.301
Like I said,

14:45.384 --> 14:48.345
Director Choi and everyone
at the SAA don't know a thing.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.515
Are you sure all is safe
within the station?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.225
That's what the numbers say.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.813
Doc Hong, so we can take these off?

14:57.897 --> 15:00.774
Well, theoretically speaking, yes.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.320
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

15:12.870 --> 15:15.372
It looks like the numbers
are at a normal level.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.043
But in order to carry out our mission,

15:19.835 --> 15:22.504
we must make
a full inspection of the station.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.898
Our mission isn't to investigate the cause
of the accident at Balhae Station.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.405
Take off your life support systems.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.824
Right now?

15:51.325 --> 15:52.368
Yes, sir.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.915
Soochan, check the system
according to the manual.

15:57.998 --> 16:01.961
Yes, sir. I will activate
the air purification system first.

16:03.712 --> 16:04.755
Take off your equipment.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.057
AIR PURIFICATION SYSTEM, PREPARING

16:18.560 --> 16:20.312
AIR PURIFICATION SYSTEM, ACTIVATED

16:27.611 --> 16:29.571
PURIFICATION INITIATED

17:04.231 --> 17:05.566
How are you breathing?

17:05.649 --> 17:07.901
Why does my throat feel sore?

17:07.985 --> 17:09.653
I'm not breathing right now.

17:10.612 --> 17:11.905
Is it working?

17:11.989 --> 17:13.240
It's better than breathing.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.909
Soochan, stop chitchatting
and focus on your mission.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.578
Don't get cute and cause trouble.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.663
-Okay, fine.
-You can't ask me for--

17:19.747 --> 17:22.416
Stop nagging. You came to do this, right?

17:22.916 --> 17:25.085
That's enough of your nagging. Okay?

17:26.670 --> 17:28.547
You're just like Dad.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.640
Red areas are restricted areas

17:38.724 --> 17:42.227
and require authorization level one
or higher to access.

17:42.311 --> 17:46.315
As you can see,
it doesn't show what those facilities are.

17:46.398 --> 17:50.277
Which means the crew members here
couldn't have known where everything was.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.113
Why is everything so mysterious?

17:53.197 --> 17:54.698
And oddly enough,

17:54.782 --> 17:59.536
the supposed areas that were shut down
due to extreme contamination

17:59.620 --> 18:02.414
were mostly these restricted
level-one areas.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.625
Well, let's say it's just a coincidence.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.668
Where are the samples?

18:07.252 --> 18:11.590
There are three storages where the samples
are most likely to remain secure.

18:11.673 --> 18:15.469
The closest one is Storage Two,
north of the command center.

18:15.552 --> 18:16.553
STORAGE 2

18:30.484 --> 18:33.779
Supporting facilities surround
the command center and the main lab

18:33.862 --> 18:35.197
in the station.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.284
There are a total of eight gates
in Balhae Station.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.912
In order to avoid contaminated areas,

18:41.995 --> 18:46.208
it'll be safest to take a detour
to the machine room from the main gate.

18:57.678 --> 18:58.804
We're splitting up.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.516
Doc Hong, E2, and I
are going to Storage One.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.643
Taesuk, Sun, Soochan, and E1, Storage Two.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.563
Chief Gong, Dr. Song, and Gisu,
Storage Three.

19:09.106 --> 19:09.940
Dr. Song?

19:12.776 --> 19:17.823
Yes. As soon as you locate the capsule,
you must check the thermoregulator first.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.742
If the capsule maintained
its extremely low temperature,

19:20.826 --> 19:24.663
the status screen on the top
will be lit up in green.

19:25.247 --> 19:28.667
If you see a red light, do not touch it.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.919
Keep reporting your team's location,

19:31.003 --> 19:33.255
and if the sample you find seems unusual,

19:33.338 --> 19:34.923
contact Dr. Song immediately.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.341
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.057
Why did he clap?

19:44.141 --> 19:45.475
-No idea.
-Soochan.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.352
Yes, Dr. Song.

19:49.563 --> 19:54.109
The crew members of Balhae Station
had biometric chips in them, right?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.527
Yes, they did.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.535
Can you access them from the main system?

20:04.036 --> 20:08.123
We could probably find
the victims' identities and locations.

20:09.791 --> 20:13.629
I gave it a try, but I think
the accident caused the chips to go dead.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.255
Why do you ask?

20:16.757 --> 20:17.591
It's nothing.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.509
I just got curious.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.346
We can't let the bereaved families know,
so there's no use.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.266
See you later.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.271
Let's find them and go home.

21:50.684 --> 21:54.062
Both the Moon and Mars
aren't adequate for human survival.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.774
I feel bad for saying this
about someone who died,

21:58.358 --> 22:02.279
but only tenacious people like Mr. Hwang
can last a few years at a place like this.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.197
How can anybody do this?

22:04.281 --> 22:05.866
It'd drive you insane.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.952
I'm sure it's all the same
for everyone who ended up here.

22:09.036 --> 22:12.205
It's all because of the fucking water.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.915
For Han Yunjae too.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.752
He acts all haughty
as the legendary figure of the SAA,

22:16.835 --> 22:19.713
but he only came back to get water.

22:19.796 --> 22:22.841
He recently quit working there,

22:23.592 --> 22:25.844
but Director Choi called him back
in an emergency.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.764
He fell for the offer
to get a higher water class.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.515
You must know him very well.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.476
Yes, of course. I know him very well.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.520
Accepted and graduated from
the military academy top of his class.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.147
He's a legend.

22:37.939 --> 22:40.859
I get that he's competent and talented.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.070
But he's not someone good to work with.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.864
He has an awful temper
and is completely inflexible.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.783
Hey, is it this way?

22:47.866 --> 22:51.036
I mean, every other family
loses their kid in this day and age.

22:59.961 --> 23:03.590
One out of every ten kids born after
the Great Drought dies within five years.

23:03.673 --> 23:06.385
His daughter held out
for a long time thanks to her dad.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.636
I'm sorry.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.721
I don't care for that information.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.099
How rude.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.984
Lieutenant Ryu,
I heard you used to be a pilot too.

23:23.068 --> 23:23.902
Yes.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.071
Then you became
a chief engineer right away?

23:26.154 --> 23:27.030
Yes.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.534
It felt suffocating
to stick around at headquarters.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.536
Oh, so it felt suffocating?

23:32.619 --> 23:34.329
So you came to get some air.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.708
-You're amazing.
-Right? Isn't he?

23:38.792 --> 23:42.170
It took Soochan about three, four years
to become a chief engineer.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.214
Lieutenant Ryu is just exceptional.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.174
I would've done it sooner if I wanted to.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.385
-My gosh.
-What? Why?

23:50.887 --> 23:52.097
-Damn.
-My gosh.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.933
Why would anyone draw something here?

23:55.892 --> 23:58.228
-Let's go.
-Didn't they have anything better to do?

24:00.480 --> 24:02.482
It's just a drawing. Yes.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.153
Wait up.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.906
What?

24:09.990 --> 24:10.991
It's not opening?

24:32.012 --> 24:35.265
Soochan, the gate won't open.
Can you check the security setting?

24:36.766 --> 24:38.685
The system looked fine.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.645
<i>It might be a mechanical problem.</i>

24:40.729 --> 24:42.147
Should we force it open?

24:43.148 --> 24:43.982
Get on it.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.113
One, two, three.

24:55.535 --> 24:56.953
One, two, three.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.793
One, two, three.

25:36.326 --> 25:39.871
It must've been a tough decision
for you to join this mission.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.631
What can we leave behind
for the next generation?

25:55.095 --> 25:56.555
Mr. Hwang,

25:57.430 --> 25:59.307
do you know anything about Luna?

26:03.228 --> 26:04.187
It's just…

26:05.605 --> 26:08.900
Director Choi mentioned it
while I was in a meeting with her.

26:10.110 --> 26:13.280
I highly doubt she'd mention Luna.

26:31.381 --> 26:34.342
Luna is the data storage
at Balhae Station.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.449
Why are you so startled?

26:59.117 --> 27:00.744
I guess something's down there?

27:16.051 --> 27:17.052
Wait, one second.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.012
Captain, it looks like

27:19.554 --> 27:21.306
something is stuck.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.351
Something is in there.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.545
<i>Captain, did you open it?</i>

27:56.216 --> 27:57.217
<i>Captain?</i>

27:58.009 --> 27:59.260
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

27:59.344 --> 28:00.970
We found bodies.

28:01.554 --> 28:03.348
They seem to be
Balhae Station crew members.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.869
Captain, is everything okay?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.831
<i>We're fine.</i>
<i>We'll record the site and keep moving.</i>

28:31.543 --> 28:32.961
Why? It won't open?

28:33.753 --> 28:36.214
Not a damn thing
works smoothly in this station.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.928
Dr. Hong, can you show me
what the scene looks like?

28:42.011 --> 28:44.097
<i>Sure, give me a second.</i>

29:00.822 --> 29:03.116
I see traces of them
trying to make an escape.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.412
It looks like the area
was shut down in an emergency

29:08.288 --> 29:10.165
right after the accident.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.459
<i>That's really weird.</i>

29:12.542 --> 29:16.296
The government stated
they all died before the shutdown.

29:16.379 --> 29:19.799
You're right. What exactly happened here?

29:23.720 --> 29:25.430
Report when you find the sample.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.390
We'll head over to Storage One soon.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.184
<i>Wait.</i>

29:29.893 --> 29:33.563
I don't see any burn scars
on the dead bodies.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.148
<i>Right.</i>

29:35.940 --> 29:40.028
They all have the characteristics
of drowned bodies.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.198
What in the world happened here?

29:44.073 --> 29:45.241
<i>Captain Han,</i>

29:45.825 --> 29:48.286
if we cannot conduct an autopsy now,

29:48.369 --> 29:52.665
why don't we stop by the infirmary
and check their medical records?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.585
<i>I thought we were done discussing this.</i>

29:56.419 --> 29:58.630
Since the situation has changed,

29:58.713 --> 30:00.965
I'm simply sharing my opinion again.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.468
What has changed?

30:03.551 --> 30:07.430
We found many more suspicious elements
on more dead bodies.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.849
<i>If we can collect some tissue</i>
<i>from the crew,</i>

30:09.933 --> 30:11.935
we might be able to find a lead.

30:12.018 --> 30:15.063
Can you focus on the mission
instead of your personal curiosity?

30:23.279 --> 30:24.781
What do you mean by that?

30:24.864 --> 30:26.074
You heard me.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.260
Have some water.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.892
To be honest, I was a little surprised.

30:54.477 --> 30:57.897
It couldn't have been easy,
after what happened to your sister.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.533
It's belated,

31:08.616 --> 31:11.160
but the bodies of the crew
will be retrieved

31:12.120 --> 31:15.248
before Balhae Station
is permanently shut down.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.127
That's why…

31:21.588 --> 31:25.425
I think it'd be better for everyone
if other crew members don't know

31:25.925 --> 31:29.178
that you're bereaved family
until the mission is over.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.057
I agree.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.269
It'd be burdensome on them too.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.234
But why did you…

31:45.820 --> 31:47.530
ask me to join this mission?

31:58.458 --> 31:59.834
We've arrived at Storage One.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.011
It worked.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.763
CLOSED

32:11.846 --> 32:12.680
OPEN

32:12.764 --> 32:14.849
<i>Storage Two, open.</i>

32:20.355 --> 32:22.690
<i>Storage One, open.</i>

32:34.452 --> 32:36.663
Entering Storage Two.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.541
What's all this?

32:42.251 --> 32:43.461
All of these are…

32:47.715 --> 32:49.258
Why is everything red?

32:50.259 --> 32:52.512
It looks like someone
cleaned this place out.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.558
Captain, I don't think there are

32:57.642 --> 32:58.977
<i>any samples left here.</i>

33:22.667 --> 33:24.627
It looks like someone searched the place.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.676
See if there are any intact.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.011
Yes, sir.

33:59.162 --> 34:01.247
Both teams didn't find any samples.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.207
We should hurry.

34:24.937 --> 34:25.938
Nothing?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.609
-Gosh.
-I found one.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.277
-What?
-A dead body.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.198
What's wrong? You okay?

34:35.281 --> 34:37.116
Yes, I'm fine. I'm okay.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.662
He was a crew member, right?

34:43.039 --> 34:45.166
The radiation level in here is fine too.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.962
That means they didn't die
because of the radiation.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.382
That one's empty too.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.427
They're all empty.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.221
Damn it.

34:58.304 --> 34:59.430
Let's keep looking.

34:59.972 --> 35:00.932
Okay.

35:02.975 --> 35:03.976
What's this?

35:07.647 --> 35:09.023
-I have no idea.
-What?

35:15.822 --> 35:16.697
Hey.

35:36.717 --> 35:39.011
All of these are empty too.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.888
There's nothing here.

35:47.728 --> 35:48.604
Wait.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.483
An unknown biosignal has been detected.

36:03.369 --> 36:05.288
Is it a malfunction?

36:05.371 --> 36:07.748
No, it's working fine.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.337
It's moving solo.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.464
I don't think it's one of us.

36:17.383 --> 36:20.178
Does this mean someone besides us is here?

36:20.261 --> 36:22.180
I'll go check.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.098
You two should wait here.

36:32.273 --> 36:35.985
What the heck is going on
in this cursed station?

36:37.778 --> 36:41.741
We need to know what happened
to be prepared to face things like this.

36:48.748 --> 36:49.582
Dr. Song.

36:53.544 --> 36:54.629
We should go.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.130
To where?

36:56.214 --> 36:57.298
You know,

36:58.424 --> 37:00.301
to the main infirmary, as you mentioned.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.553
I gave it some thought,

37:03.221 --> 37:05.139
and I think what you said is right.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.976
We need to know what happened here
to be thoroughly prepared.

37:10.436 --> 37:11.479
But they won't

37:12.480 --> 37:14.315
tell us anything.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.821
I'll make up an excuse for Chief Gong.
You should hurry.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.617
This is probably your only chance.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.949
I'm sorry. My gosh. I'm so sorry.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.575
What are you sorry about?

38:07.535 --> 38:09.245
-One second.
-You found one?

38:12.123 --> 38:13.291
Damn it.

38:13.916 --> 38:14.917
It's empty.

38:16.544 --> 38:17.795
All that for nothing.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.630
Let's return.

38:19.714 --> 38:20.965
Okay.

38:21.048 --> 38:21.966
All right.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.052
Fuck, they're empty.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.809
Fuck. They're all gone.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.791
This damn station is seriously cursed.

40:39.395 --> 40:40.646
Goddamnit.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.524
Everything is trouble.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.443
Where are you?

41:00.332 --> 41:01.709
Why did it go in so deep?

41:16.682 --> 41:18.309
All right, baby.

41:19.351 --> 41:21.061
Daddy will give you new batteries.

41:21.562 --> 41:22.521
Stay still.

41:27.693 --> 41:29.236
Fuck. What the hell?

45:21.593 --> 45:22.928
