WEBVTT

00:04.504 --> 00:07.272
Porter:
The zumwalt-class destroyer.

00:07.274 --> 00:09.441
Demanding the best from the navy

00:09.443 --> 00:11.176
And the companies
constructing her.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.712
You four represent
the next wave

00:13.714 --> 00:17.016
Of u.S. Defense companies

00:17.018 --> 00:20.219
Who will improve the lives
of our military personnel

00:20.221 --> 00:22.688
By keeping them safer
and better equipping them

00:22.690 --> 00:24.056
To defend us.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.759
Gentlemen, together...

00:26.761 --> 00:30.129
We are the future of
the United States navy.

00:33.066 --> 00:34.533
Man:
Madam secretary porter,

00:34.535 --> 00:37.102
Why is my logo
smaller than marc's?

00:37.104 --> 00:39.038
Beringer marine
laid down a million tons

00:39.040 --> 00:40.639
Of raw steel this year.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.374
United equinox
made a tiny screw.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.109
Marc:
Correction:

00:44.111 --> 00:46.111
We made
a teeny, tiny screw

00:46.113 --> 00:48.714
That could withstand
a 1,200 degree

00:48.716 --> 00:50.215
Temperature swing.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.518
And we made
a crap-ton of them.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.154
(alarms beeping, wailing)

00:59.826 --> 01:02.628
Is this another
dramatic touch, mcgee?

01:02.630 --> 01:04.730
Mcgee: Not exactly,
madam secretary.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.498
Network security detected

01:06.500 --> 01:08.700
An unauthorized
electronic transmission.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.569
Everything shuts down
automatically.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.571
Does that mean someone's trying
to hack in from the outside?

01:12.573 --> 01:15.474
No. Lockdown only happens
if the attack's internal.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.812
The threat's in this room.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.580
I just reread <i>moonraker.</i>

01:54.582 --> 01:57.182
Spent the whole day
reading on Sunday.

01:57.184 --> 01:59.184
Don't remember
the last time that happened.

01:59.186 --> 02:02.187
You read a lot?

02:02.189 --> 02:04.857
You know, I went out
for a drink last night,

02:04.859 --> 02:06.692
And I met a girl.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.127
(laughs)

02:08.129 --> 02:09.895
Great smile, great body.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.164
Guess what she does
for a living.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.535
I'm thinking about
getting a sex change, norma.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.438
You say something,
agent dinozzo?

02:19.440 --> 02:22.608
I'm just trying
to make conversation.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.276
With me?
Yeah.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.245
I wasn't listening.

02:28.214 --> 02:29.515
Start over.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.216
Really?

02:35.455 --> 02:38.624
So, I guess it turns out
that I'm dating a tennis pro.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.160
Want to know how she
gave me her number?

02:41.162 --> 02:43.495
Boop! Left it on her pillow.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.330
(chuckles)

02:45.332 --> 02:46.865
Hello.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.300
That's nice.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.202
That's it?

02:50.204 --> 02:51.803
What do you want?

02:51.805 --> 02:53.872
Well, a little something.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.475
Just a jibe, a scoff,
a little stink-eye, you know?

02:56.477 --> 02:57.876
I just... I need something.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.645
The riff, the patter, the "pah."

02:59.647 --> 03:02.948
Oh, you got a stink-eye
in there. I can see it.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.185
Listen, I just
need the "pah."

03:07.554 --> 03:09.955
Where's agent mcgee?
Ah.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.324
The burden shouldn't
always fall on tim.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.892
He's suffered enough.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.227
What about agent gibbs?

03:15.229 --> 03:17.796
Hey, boss, dating a tennis pro.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.231
That's nice.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.300
Let's go.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.301
See?

03:23.303 --> 03:24.636
We got a body?

03:24.638 --> 03:28.407
It's a breach.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.209
We're not driving.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.610
Where we going?

03:31.612 --> 03:32.678
Upstairs.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.949
What's happening, leon?

03:36.951 --> 03:38.684
In secure mode,

03:38.686 --> 03:43.288
Mtac sensors constantly
scan for electronic signals.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.290
Anything other than
our equipment

03:45.292 --> 03:47.893
Emits a radio frequency,
room goes on lockdown.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.929
Nobody's allowed to leave
till we find the source.

03:50.931 --> 03:51.997
Like a surveillance device,
a bug.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.332
Right.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.334
Does this happen a lot?
No.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.869
Not the brightest idea
to bring one into a secure room.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.438
That's why they're gonna
check you twice, marc.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.439
Save it, ward.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.674
Not exactly the time.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.277
All clear.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.412
I've scanned
every square inch, boss.

04:07.414 --> 04:11.383
Seats, walls, computer console--
no sign of any illicit devices.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.485
False alarm? Software glitch?
Possible.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.254
Does that mean we're free to let

04:15.256 --> 04:17.022
Our valued corporate
partners go, director?

04:17.024 --> 04:18.924
You can take us
off lockdown, fellas.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.325
Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, please.

04:20.327 --> 04:23.362
(door buzzes, opens)

04:25.431 --> 04:28.267
(alarm beeping)

04:29.403 --> 04:32.371
I thought you searched
everyone, agent dinozzo.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.273
I didn't think
you wanted me to pat down

04:34.275 --> 04:36.308
The United States
secretary of the navy, sir.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.477
Well, I do now.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.318
Uh, raise your arms,
please, ma'am.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.053
Just remember,
I have mouths to feed.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.655
Two goldfish.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.356
I'm their only
source of income,

04:51.358 --> 04:53.358
And they're-they're
awfully cute.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.661
Relax, dinozzo. I'm as anxious
about this as you are.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.934
(alarm beeping)

05:05.672 --> 05:08.373
I'm gonna have to search
your pockets, ma'am.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.375
Do you have any needles
or sharp objects?

05:10.377 --> 05:11.443
I have to ask.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.378
No. Proceed.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.754
A pen?

05:22.756 --> 05:25.757
You had me worried for
a moment, gentlemen.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.598
The hell's that?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.601
Well, first impression,
it's a flash drive

05:36.603 --> 05:38.403
Connected to
a pinhole microphone.

05:38.405 --> 05:40.105
We got our bug.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.441
I'm the breach.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.353
Okay, let's clear
the air right now.

05:54.355 --> 05:57.789
I have no idea
when or where I got that pen.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.658
Could have been a doctor's
office, bank, restaurant.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.460
The last time
I remember using it

06:01.462 --> 06:03.061
Was when I signed
a permission slip

06:03.063 --> 06:05.063
For my daughter
yesterday morning.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.432
And I must have put the pen
in my pocket after that,

06:07.434 --> 06:10.435
But I had no idea
it was recording me.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.738
Okay.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.540
You believe that?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.476
Yes.
Why?

06:20.947 --> 06:23.849
(elevator stops)

06:23.851 --> 06:24.883
Respect.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.551
For you and the office.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.720
And until there's evidence
to the contrary,

06:28.722 --> 06:30.989
You'll get the benefit
of the doubt, madam secretary.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.024
Thank you, agent gibbs.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.894
Job now is finding
who's responsible

06:35.896 --> 06:37.696
Before anything leaks.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.732
I had classified briefings

06:40.734 --> 06:43.835
At three d.O.D. Off-site
locations yesterday,

06:43.837 --> 06:45.971
And we talked enough
deployment strategy

06:45.973 --> 06:48.006
To cause serious
security problems

06:48.008 --> 06:49.975
For the sailors and
marines I work for.

06:49.977 --> 06:53.912
Understand, they are my only
concern in this, agent gibbs.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.585
(elevator starts)

07:00.587 --> 07:03.121
Abby's got the spy pen, boss.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.658
Based on the battery size and
the length of the charge left,

07:06.660 --> 07:09.428
We think it's been recording
for about 30 hours or so.

07:11.464 --> 07:12.731
Can we track who's listening?

07:12.733 --> 07:13.765
It's not a live feed.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.900
The bug stores
the data internally,

07:14.902 --> 07:16.568
Which means
whoever planted it

07:16.570 --> 07:18.036
Has to download the info.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.539
Which we have to assume
they've already done.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.941
All right, I will alert
the pentagon that my meetings

07:22.943 --> 07:23.975
Yesterday were compromised.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.944
And we should bring in the nsa.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.180
I just put in
a request for info.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.916
They got ears open
for the sale of u.S. Intel.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.083
Let's make sure
it doesn't get that far.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.618
You zig, I zag, boss.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.454
While I was
on the horn with nsa,

07:35.456 --> 07:37.088
I pulled a threat
analysis report.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.691
They put this together
in the last ten minutes?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.626
No. The paper's
two years old.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.528
But it predicts
our breach exactly.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.697
"clandestine
recording device,

07:45.699 --> 07:48.066
"high-level
government official,

07:48.068 --> 07:50.001
"an everyday item

07:50.003 --> 07:52.070
Such as an ink pen."

07:53.506 --> 07:54.906
Coincidence?

07:54.908 --> 07:58.510
We need to talk to the
person who wrote this paper.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.754
I thought we were gonna get a
cavity search coming in here.

08:09.756 --> 08:12.090
Interesting.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.091
Hmm.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.894
Whoa, look at that.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.631
We better not tell mcgee about
the    <i>star tr</i>video game chairs.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.267
It'll just irritate him.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.936
It's like an apple store.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.671
You must be ncis.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.974
Welcome to the national security
operations center.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.209
I'm nsa special agent
chad flynderling.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.611
You can call me flynn.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.745
Flynn.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.213
Like jeff bridges in <i>tron?</i>

08:35.982 --> 08:38.183
That's original.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.951
Sorry. I'm sorry.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.787
I'm sensitive to nsa's
public perception right now.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.690
We're not just a bunch
of reclusive data nerds.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.293
Our employees are as diverse
as the work that we do here.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.595
And I swear,
if I have to hear another crack

08:50.597 --> 08:51.763
About the <i>star trek</i> chairs...

08:51.765 --> 08:53.665
Oh, hey, look at those.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.600
Didn't even notice them.
(chuckles)

08:55.602 --> 08:58.069
I reviewed the threat report
you called about.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.938
You write it?
Well, no.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.007
Uh, but I can assist you
with anything you might need.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.142
We asked for
the original author.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.914
Make it so, number one.

09:10.850 --> 09:11.850
What's the problem?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.652
Uh...

09:13.654 --> 09:17.689
About those reclusive data
freaks I was talking about...

09:21.260 --> 09:23.295
(humming quietly)

09:23.297 --> 09:25.564
(music playing faintly
over earbuds)

09:38.110 --> 09:40.078
So how long
does this go on?

09:40.080 --> 09:43.048
Yeah, just wait for it.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.051
(gasps)

09:46.053 --> 09:47.719
(laughs)

09:50.122 --> 09:51.890
(sighs)

09:51.892 --> 09:53.191
Uh, agents gibbs
and dinozzo,

09:53.193 --> 09:55.093
I give you nsa analyst

09:55.095 --> 09:56.261
Ellie bishop.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.163
She prefers to do her

09:58.165 --> 10:00.131
Unclassified research in here.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.667
I thought we discussed
rule number one, flynn.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.070
When my earbuds are in,
flash the desk light.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.071
(whispers):
Couldn't help it.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.305
(sighs)
bishop.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.708
It's good to meet you.

10:09.710 --> 10:13.178
Sorry, I was
in the middle of... Stuff.

10:14.146 --> 10:16.681
Yup. That's my work.
What's up?

10:16.683 --> 10:17.849
You didn't even look at it.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.651
I wrote it
my third day at the nsa.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.752
It was a Wednesday morning.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.154
I just finished
a box of cocoa pebbles.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.224
I remember that
because it was

10:26.226 --> 10:28.360
The prize inside the box
that inspired the entire paper.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.795
Let me guess. A pen?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.664
An everyday object
hiding in plain sight.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.799
It clicked. (clucks tongue)

10:34.801 --> 10:37.202
So you got 25 pages
of national security strategy

10:37.204 --> 10:39.938
From inside a breakfast cereal?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.406
In order to better prepare
for attacks,

10:41.408 --> 10:43.141
I dream up threats
that haven't happened yet.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.409
This dream came true.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.945
So I was right.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.115
Secretary of the navy
was bugged.

10:50.117 --> 10:53.018
Security intel
is at risk.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.387
Which is bad.

10:55.389 --> 10:58.023
But I submit my reports
to my superiors,

10:58.025 --> 10:59.658
Who then distribute them
accordingly.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.260
Anyone with basic security
clearance could have access.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.229
Did you give this paper
to anybody else?
No.

11:05.431 --> 11:07.832
Are you asking if
I'm in on it or something?

11:09.869 --> 11:10.935
(laughs)

11:10.937 --> 11:12.303
Uh, no, I-I'm not, I...

11:12.305 --> 11:13.972
I wrote the playbook,
but I have

11:13.974 --> 11:15.240
No idea who's running it.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.209
Sorry.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.812
Hope you find your guy.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.881
It was nice to meet you.

11:25.317 --> 11:26.918
(music playing over earbuds)

11:26.920 --> 11:28.086
Like I said,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.854
She's not a field agent.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.022
I can still hear you,
jeff daniels.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.223
Jeff daniels wasn't in <i>tron.</i>

11:32.225 --> 11:33.992
That was jeff bridges.
(cell phone ringing)

11:33.994 --> 11:36.261
Flynn, you <i>are</i> a fan.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.862
Gibbs:
Yeah, duck?

11:39.265 --> 11:41.399
Yep, we're on
our way back.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.234
We have got
a second pen.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.436
So I guess
this means

11:44.438 --> 11:46.037
I'm riding with you guys.
No.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.272
No, but she is.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.140
What? Why?
What? Why?

11:52.812 --> 11:55.246
'cause, like you said,

11:55.248 --> 11:58.349
You wrote the
playbook, right?

11:58.351 --> 12:00.418
(sighs)

12:10.963 --> 12:12.964
What are we doing here?

12:12.966 --> 12:15.033
I'm waiting for
ducky, our m.E.

12:16.335 --> 12:18.069
That stands for
"medical examiner."

12:18.071 --> 12:21.339
This isn't my first case.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.008
I meant, what am <i>I</i> doing here?

12:24.010 --> 12:25.844
I analyze big-
picture data,

12:25.846 --> 12:28.913
Present detailed strategies
in the global war on terror.

12:30.182 --> 12:33.051
Chess moves that can take
years to implement.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.853
You enjoy playing board games?

12:34.855 --> 12:36.387
(sighs)

12:36.389 --> 12:38.923
Look, everything I can offer you
is in that report.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.225
What good can I do in person?

12:40.227 --> 12:42.160
I don't know,
but you can start

12:42.162 --> 12:43.394
By catching up
on the case file.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.996
Ducky:
Yes.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.232
Well, then, can you
tell me how long?

12:47.234 --> 12:49.267
Of course
I can hold on.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.237
I don't suppose you're from the
fbi and you've come to tell me

12:52.239 --> 12:53.838
That all this is
a misunderstanding?

12:53.840 --> 12:54.973
Sorry, nsa. My name...

12:54.975 --> 12:57.242
That is
totally irrelevant.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.444
I was just talking
to the man ten minutes ago.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.147
The d.C. M.E. Is
dodging my calls.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.149
Duck, I thought this was
about another bug,

13:04.151 --> 13:06.117
Not a body.
It's both.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.554
Thanks to our bolo, the
m.E. Found a second pen

13:09.556 --> 13:12.257
When he went back through
this man's personal effects.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.558
He's claude sherman,

13:13.560 --> 13:14.559
Accountant for
united equinox electronics.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.327
Yeah, he worked

13:16.329 --> 13:18.329
For one of the companies
in mtac this morning.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.098
Murder?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.566
No, natural causes.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.269
Myocardial infarction
two days ago.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.436
Ducky, then what's
he doing here?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.871
Body and personal effects
travel together

13:26.873 --> 13:28.373
In order to preserve
the chain of evidence.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.309
Like I said,
this is not my first case.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.111
Stop.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.979
Ducky, where's the pen?
It's missing.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.348
That's why I've been on
the phone all morning.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.059
Yeah, according

13:48.061 --> 13:49.360
To the m.E.'s office,

13:49.362 --> 13:51.596
An fbi agent collected
the personal effects

13:51.598 --> 13:54.365
Just before the
transfer at 0915.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.601
The problem is,
when I called to confirm,

13:56.603 --> 13:58.870
The fbi doesn't know
anything about it.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.905
Somebody posing as an agent.
It would appear so.

14:00.907 --> 14:04.209
Leaving us a body
and more questions.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.877
Who stole the pen?

14:05.879 --> 14:07.412
Was it the same person
who planted it

14:07.414 --> 14:08.446
On secnav?

14:10.115 --> 14:11.449
What's the connection?

14:11.451 --> 14:15.353
I'm sorry...
What was your name again?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.354
Bishop.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.090
You got something?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.992
Yeah, uh, maybe.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.194
You got any food around here?

14:24.129 --> 14:25.296
Anything?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.034
We'll find stuff. Come on.

14:32.271 --> 14:34.372
(chuckles)

14:34.374 --> 14:36.341
Pentagon refuses to
release any of the minutes

14:36.343 --> 14:37.575
From secnav's briefings.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.444
Once the intel leaks,
the whole world will know.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.312
Yeah, it's what
I told them,

14:41.314 --> 14:43.381
Except all they could say
was, topics of discussion

14:43.383 --> 14:46.417
Included russia,
china, syria and iran.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.485
That narrows it down.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.254
Yeah.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.255
That her?

14:50.257 --> 14:51.389
She fall down?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.624
(music playing faintly
over earbuds)

14:52.626 --> 14:54.893
Oh, uh, don't let
the chaos fool you.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.895
This is just how I work.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.164
All right,
jeff goldblum,

15:00.166 --> 15:02.267
Guy plants a bug
on secnav,

15:02.269 --> 15:03.268
Uploads the data.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.369
What's he do with it?

15:04.371 --> 15:06.537
Go.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.539
Did you read my paper?

15:08.541 --> 15:10.174
Some... Some of it, but I...

15:10.176 --> 15:12.911
Time is a factor here,
and I...

15:14.046 --> 15:16.014
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you married?

15:16.016 --> 15:18.216
I'll have my report
to you by tonight, okay?

15:18.218 --> 15:19.450
Report?
Mm-hmm.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.451
Tonight?

15:20.453 --> 15:21.486
Wait, let's back the truck up.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.087
How old are you?
Ha.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.389
I thought time was a
factor around here.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.457
Isn't talking about my
personal life a waste of it?

15:26.459 --> 15:27.525
No.
Yes.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.927
Well, the way I
see it, our guy

15:28.929 --> 15:30.561
Has three options.
One: He releases

15:30.563 --> 15:32.630
The information in the name
of full disclosure.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.433
Two: He sells the data
to the enemy.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.136
What kind of intel
the bug would record.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.604
Needs to find
the right buyer.
Which takes time.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.372
Leaving us with option three:

15:41.374 --> 15:43.274
He sells the information
back to us.

15:43.276 --> 15:47.278
Yeah, uh, wait, tha-that...
That was just a guess.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.479
We need to alert
the secnav's office

15:48.481 --> 15:49.547
This guy might be calling.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.115
He just did.
Extortion?

15:51.117 --> 15:52.617
Clock's already started.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.196
12:30 p.M., secnav's
office was contacted

16:05.198 --> 16:06.698
Via an encrypted e-mail.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.200
We have one hour
to deposit $10 million

16:09.202 --> 16:11.669
Into an offshore account
or he leaks the intel.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.172
No, who's ever behind
this knows their way

16:14.174 --> 16:15.573
Around computer code
and knows how to hide.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.509
Of catching this guy
before the deadline?

16:18.511 --> 16:20.712
Well, they get better
if we just pay him.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.750
Give the man what he wants.
No.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.553
Giving terrorists anything,

16:28.555 --> 16:30.655
Much less taxpayer money.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.590
Neither do I,
but like I told my boss at nsa,

16:32.592 --> 16:34.092
It's the cost of
doing business.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.760
If we deposit the
money into the account

16:35.762 --> 16:38.096
And he accesses it, it gives
us something to trace.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.599
Tony: Would that be the
same paper our spy

16:41.601 --> 16:43.101
Could be using
as a paint-by-numbers?

16:43.103 --> 16:44.402
He'll know
that's our strategy.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.636
He would have guessed it anyway,

16:45.638 --> 16:47.739
Which makes it our nsa codes
against his.

16:47.741 --> 16:50.775
And statistically,
the odds are in our favor.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.778
It's our best way
of finding him.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.313
Statistics don't lie.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.748
Yeah, but our bad guy might.
Lie?

16:56.750 --> 16:58.082
About what?
We don't know

16:58.084 --> 17:00.351
Anything about him
or what he wants.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.720
He wants money, right?

17:02.722 --> 17:04.689
Unless he hasn't shown
his full hand.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.792
Keep digging till we find it.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.661
That doesn't...
Doesn't make sense.

17:10.663 --> 17:14.499
Sure, but gut logic aside,
I think we can all agree here

17:14.501 --> 17:16.601
That actual
logic is better.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.802
Well, we're about to find out.

17:17.804 --> 17:18.770
Secnav just approved

17:18.772 --> 17:20.538
Bishop's game plan.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.074
Gave nsa the lead
on the money-drop.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.044
Porter wants to have
a word with us, gibbs.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.347
Gibbs:
Good.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.554
(chuckles)

17:43.529 --> 17:45.530
Marc: <i>The same kind</i>
<i>of surveillance device</i>

17:45.532 --> 17:47.432
Was found
on my corporate accountant.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.433
I didn't plant

17:48.435 --> 17:49.700
A bug on your employee,

17:49.702 --> 17:52.103
And I sure as hell
didn't plant a bug

17:52.105 --> 17:53.805
On the secretary of the navy!

17:53.807 --> 17:55.640
You got stones
accusing me of treason.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.075
There's no sense
pointing fingers.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.476
Quit playing the patriot, ward.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.745
I am a patriot. My company's
been serving this military

18:00.747 --> 18:02.213
For four generations.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.816
We're not some
startup war profiteer.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.317
That's enough.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.086
I understand you're concerned

18:08.088 --> 18:09.120
About corporate secrets
being leaked.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.755
Even if nothing leaks,

18:10.757 --> 18:12.723
Word of this would kill me
on wall street.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.259
We're talking
hundreds of millions.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.095
We are following
up on the device

18:17.097 --> 18:20.498
Found on your employee, marc,
but give us time to do our jobs.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.102
That our best agents are working
on this around the clock.

18:26.839 --> 18:30.475
Oh, I'm pretty sure you just
took us off the clock, ma'am.

18:33.245 --> 18:36.647
Gentlemen, if you'll
excuse me for a moment.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.485
I'm getting hit
on all sides with this--

18:40.487 --> 18:41.819
Pentagon, white house.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.822
Last thing anybody needs
is another intel scandal,

18:44.824 --> 18:47.492
And nsa is prepared
for this kind of threat.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.893
So are we,
madam secretary.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.129
And I want you to keep
up the good work, leon.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.598
I'm not benching you; I'm just
adding more players to the game.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.833
Different players have
different strengths.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.736
Yes, and as head coach,
I have the lineup

18:58.738 --> 19:00.738
Just the way I
want it, director.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.509
Is that understood?

19:07.446 --> 19:09.447
Everybody's looking

19:09.449 --> 19:11.716
At a female secnav with
no military background,

19:11.718 --> 19:13.518
Wondering if either
one of those things

19:13.520 --> 19:14.919
Are gonna be a factor.

19:14.921 --> 19:18.222
I'd like to answer them
by setting this right.

19:19.358 --> 19:23.294
And to do that, I need
all the help I can get.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.363
Especially yours.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.705
Abby:
Oh, god.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.706
(groans)

19:35.708 --> 19:38.743
Stupid pen, give me answers.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.944
(clears throat)

19:41.914 --> 19:43.881
How long have you been
standing there?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.950
Oh, just a few minutes.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.885
I thought you knew.
No.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.221
But you were talking to me.

19:50.223 --> 19:53.758
No, I-I was talking to myself

19:53.760 --> 19:55.860
And a... Pen.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.296
But now I'm not talking anymore,

19:58.298 --> 19:59.964
'cause who knows
who's listening?

19:59.966 --> 20:03.568
Who do you
think's listening?

20:11.910 --> 20:14.278
Oh, no... Don't believe
everything you hear.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.247
I mean, we don't randomly listen

20:16.249 --> 20:18.282
To conversations
and phone calls.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.954
I'm serious.

20:22.956 --> 20:25.223
We need a court order
just like you.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.358
We've had
a few bad apples,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.360
But we're good people

20:29.362 --> 20:31.529
Out to uphold the law
and make a difference.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.932
So you haven't bugged my phone?

20:34.934 --> 20:35.967
(laughs)

20:35.969 --> 20:39.270
Look, I can prove
I'm here to help.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.539
I drew this using d.C.
Examiner's description

20:41.541 --> 20:43.641
Of our bogus fbi
agent, fed it

20:43.643 --> 20:45.776
Into the nsa database,
and got a hit on a guy named

20:45.778 --> 20:47.011
Rudolph stalin.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.279
Rudolph stalin.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.914
Okay.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.351
Rudolph stalin is
an american citizen

20:53.353 --> 20:56.354
With a history of
international espionage

20:56.356 --> 20:58.723
And strong political
ties to russia.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.459
And a very nice
mustache.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.394
I wonder if it's
supposed to be ironic.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.263
He's been on our radar
for about a year.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.865
Aha, hmm, and he is
an american citizen.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.735
Which is exactly why
we needed a court order.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.536
I remember reading
his file a few months ago

21:12.538 --> 21:16.507
Over a bowl
of cream of mushroom soup.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.044
I-I food-associate.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.480
Oh.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.616
I-I'm just... I'm still stuck
on the fact that you can draw.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.986
I mean, this isn't kate
good, but it's <i>good</i> good.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.288
Who's kate?

21:30.290 --> 21:32.790
That-that would
take a few hours

21:32.792 --> 21:35.326
And a whole box
of tissues.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.828
Okay, well, then we should
get this bolo out first,

21:37.830 --> 21:40.431
And I wanted to check up
on the nsa operation.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.333
(cell phone ringtone playing)
mm-hmm.

21:42.335 --> 21:46.070
Hey, gibbs, did you know
that bishop can draw?

21:46.072 --> 21:47.371
Yeah, she's still here.

21:47.373 --> 21:49.774
Why?

21:53.011 --> 21:55.012
Okay.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.348
Abby?

21:57.350 --> 21:59.317
What? Is it about
the money-drop?

21:59.319 --> 22:02.086
Maybe we should have
that talk about kate.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.326
Manager heard the shots,
called the police.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.927
Nobody saw the shooter.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.029
Mcgee: Nsa deposited
the extortion money,

22:12.031 --> 22:14.999
And our spy accessed it
using the coffee shop's wi-fi.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.068
It's not the first place
I'd come to collect $10 million.

22:17.070 --> 22:19.103
Mcgee: Agent flynderling
thought the same thing.

22:19.105 --> 22:22.039
That's why he came to follow up
before calling in a task force.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.442
Three gunshot wounds
to the chest at close range.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.478
Based on the stippling
and tissue damage,

22:27.480 --> 22:28.879
He never had
a chance.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.381
Barely got out of his car.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.782
Ambushed.
Boss,

22:31.784 --> 22:33.784
He's got something
in his pocket.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.128
Hey, boss, isn't this her...

22:49.601 --> 22:51.836
My report.

22:56.441 --> 22:58.509
You were right, agent gibbs.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.412
It's not about that, bishop.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.461
Somebody plants a
surveillance device

23:17.463 --> 23:19.029
On the secretary
of the navy,

23:19.031 --> 23:20.698
And extorts
the u.S. Government.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.667
Likely the same guy
who posed as an fbi agent

23:23.669 --> 23:26.404
To steal a second spy pen
from the d.C. Morgue.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.605
Mcgee:
Rudolph stalin--

23:27.607 --> 23:28.639
He's an american wanted

23:28.641 --> 23:30.007
For selling u.S. Intel
to russia.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.675
Tony: With a name
and a mustache

23:31.677 --> 23:33.010
Like that, I...
I'm shocked.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.545
Mcgee: But when
the nsa tried

23:34.547 --> 23:35.846
To pay him off and
track the deposit...

23:35.848 --> 23:37.681
He murdered
nsa agent flynderling

23:37.683 --> 23:39.150
And got away with the money.

23:39.152 --> 23:41.419
Actually, I just checked
the offshore account.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.953
The extortion money's
still there.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.822
He left behind
ten million bucks.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.857
That doesn't make any sense.
Could've panicked
after the shooting.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.759
Maybe this guy's not as
professional as we thought.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.596
Uncle sam's money in
the first place.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.565
What... What else
does stalin get

23:54.567 --> 23:57.001
By luring and killing
a federal agent?

24:00.505 --> 24:02.440
Authentication.
Proof to another buyer

24:02.442 --> 24:04.141
That his intel
is genuine.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.976
Somebody willing to pay
more than ten mil.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.846
So he used us?
This guy was playing chess,
and I never even saw it.

24:10.715 --> 24:12.850
I know what I have to do.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.654
Reset.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.457
I'll start over.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.925
Bishop.
I'll get it this time.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.893
I just need some time
to clear the chessboard.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.829
Bishop.
(sighs)

24:24.831 --> 24:25.896
Take a break.

24:27.699 --> 24:28.833
Go get a soda.

24:28.835 --> 24:32.203
There's no time,
and I have no cash.

24:37.909 --> 24:39.643
Both:
Take it.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.245
(cell phone ringing)

24:41.247 --> 24:43.214
(sighs)

24:43.216 --> 24:45.683
Abby: Can you come to my lab?
Yep.

24:49.754 --> 24:52.523
Michelangelo, shakespeare,
da vinci, hemingway.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.758
Today, you can count me
amongst their ranks, gibbs.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.627
I do every day, abbs.
What do you got?

24:56.629 --> 24:58.829
A masterpiece.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.265
Well, it looks like
a date and time stamp.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.934
Sometimes the greatest
works of art are simple.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.270
You got into the pen?
No. I failed.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.772
The internal memory chip
was too well encrypted.

25:08.774 --> 25:11.575
That is the last day and time

25:11.577 --> 25:14.912
The chip was accessed
by the wi-fi transmitter.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.849
Ah. That the send-y part?

25:18.851 --> 25:20.251
(laughs)
yes.

25:20.253 --> 25:22.253
So, I can't tell you

25:22.255 --> 25:24.154
What our bad guy
downloaded from the pen,

25:24.156 --> 25:26.156
But, because of
the send-y part,

25:26.158 --> 25:27.825
I can tell you
when he did it.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.760
Yeah. Yesterday.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.262
7:23 p.M.

25:31.264 --> 25:33.264
And assuming that
secnav still had the pen

25:33.266 --> 25:35.933
In her pocket--
I cross-referenced her schedule.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.868
Porter was at a
restaurant having dinner

25:37.870 --> 25:39.770
With her teenage daughter
when stalin was downloading.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.739
How close would
he have to be?

25:41.741 --> 25:44.675
Close. It's a small
pen-- small antenna.

25:44.677 --> 25:47.711
So I pulled street
surveillance footage from

25:47.713 --> 25:49.680
Near the restaurant, and found
stalin sitting in his car,

25:49.682 --> 25:51.715
Committing high treason.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.884
I guess having eyes and ears
everywhere can be helpful.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.786
But don't tell bishop
I said that.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.288
License plate.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.757
Already added
to the bolo, gibbs.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.158
Our chances of
finding this guy

26:01.160 --> 26:02.593
Just skyrocketed.

26:02.595 --> 26:04.128
Abbs, that's really
great work.

26:18.877 --> 26:21.912
I'm sorry for your loss.

26:23.815 --> 26:27.718
The agent who was killed--
was he a friend of yours?

26:27.720 --> 26:30.588
More like an older brother.

26:32.624 --> 26:33.791
(cell phone chimes)

26:40.932 --> 26:43.767
Everything okay?

26:43.769 --> 26:46.003
It's tough not being able

26:46.005 --> 26:48.839
To talk to my family
about what I do.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.309
You should've seen my mom
when I told her

26:52.311 --> 26:54.111
I was taking a job
outside of oklahoma.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.312
Why did you?

26:55.314 --> 26:57.181
Mm. That's the difference

26:57.183 --> 26:58.983
Between mom and dad.

26:58.985 --> 27:02.720
His first rule is: Comfort
makes for complicity.

27:02.722 --> 27:06.223
Means the only way to grow
is by challenging yourself.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.759
Well, it helps to remember
why we do the job.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.729
Keeps us going.

27:14.165 --> 27:16.967
Actually, I should
get back to nsa.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.370
Mm. You're not getting off
that easy.

27:19.372 --> 27:21.639
Gibbs likes rules, too.
Number 45:

27:21.641 --> 27:23.273
Always clean up your mess.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.643
How?
Well, for starters,

27:25.645 --> 27:27.845
The bolo came back
on rudolph stalin.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.279
We know where he is.

27:30.715 --> 27:33.017
Come on.
Time's a-wastin'.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.165
Bishop:
Okay, thanks.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.933
Metro pd says
stalin's car

27:49.935 --> 27:51.969
Is still parked
in a lot out front.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.437
They're not sure
which theater he's in,

27:53.439 --> 27:55.906
But there are only two screens.
Where do you want me?

27:55.908 --> 27:56.974
I aced my weapons
and field training.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.809
You got a gun, ado annie?

27:58.811 --> 28:01.311
I left it in my surrey
with the fringe on top.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.380
Don't quote
<i>oklahoma</i> to me.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.884
Stay in the car.

28:06.886 --> 28:07.951
You bet.

28:15.994 --> 28:18.062
(music playing faintly
over earbuds)

28:23.101 --> 28:25.903
(sputters)

28:31.376 --> 28:32.743
Him.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.111
That's him!

28:36.281 --> 28:37.715
Tony:
Federal agent!

28:40.385 --> 28:42.252
(engine starts)

28:42.254 --> 28:43.353
Stop, stop, stop!

28:43.355 --> 28:45.022
(tires screeching)

28:52.197 --> 28:54.331
Bishop, why'd you hit him
with the car?

28:54.333 --> 28:57.067
Well... Technically,
he ran into the car.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.237
Got to say, that was a gut move.
Gut's good, right?

29:00.239 --> 29:02.339
We intentionally
flushed the guy out.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.974
Gibbs had the exit covered
the whole time.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.042
What?

29:05.044 --> 29:08.779
She pulled a palmer
on this guy, boss.

29:08.781 --> 29:11.315
(handcuffs clicking)

29:11.317 --> 29:14.885
At least he'll go quietly.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.757
I'm not saying anything
without a lawyer.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.492
You hit me
with a car.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.494
I thought he was
getting away.

29:23.496 --> 29:26.964
I read in his file that he
was a high school track star.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.467
I remember almost
everything I read.

29:32.170 --> 29:35.472
Which includes more than a few
interrogation transcripts.

29:35.474 --> 29:36.940
Meaning what?

29:36.942 --> 29:38.976
I have an idea.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.311
Hang on. These.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.446
What?

29:42.448 --> 29:43.380
Bishop:
I need to borrow this.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.349
Thank you.

29:45.351 --> 29:47.417
Now, a major principle
of an interrogation

29:47.419 --> 29:49.453
Is to let the suspect draw
their own conclusions, right?

29:49.455 --> 29:53.357
Which means, as long as I
never <i>say</i> I'm his lawyer,

29:53.359 --> 29:56.360
As long as he never asks...

29:56.362 --> 29:57.928
Stop.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.467
I can keep up.

30:06.171 --> 30:09.406
Did that guy see you
before you hit him?

30:09.408 --> 30:11.074
Mm-mm.

30:14.212 --> 30:17.514
Look, we called the
public defender...

30:17.516 --> 30:18.515
Hey. What...

30:18.517 --> 30:19.917
Finally. Are you my...?

30:19.919 --> 30:21.518
Bishop:
Sorry for the outfit.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.420
Today was supposed to be
my day off. Ellie bishop.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.521
Have you been asking
him questions?

30:24.523 --> 30:25.989
Gibbs:
Legally, we can ask

30:25.991 --> 30:27.324
As many questions as we want.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.893
Up to the suspect
to talk without a lawyer.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.495
That's true.
Do you want to talk?

30:31.497 --> 30:35.566
Shouldn't we speak somewhere
in private first? Or...

30:35.568 --> 30:37.201
It's up to you.
I mean, I've read the file,

30:37.203 --> 30:38.569
And they do have
a pretty solid murder case.

30:38.571 --> 30:41.471
Murder?
Yeah. Of a federal agent.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.473
No way. I-I didn't
kill anybody.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.509
They know about the pen
on the secretary of the navy.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.477
They know that you were
at the restaurant,

30:47.479 --> 30:48.912
And they know about
the $10 million.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.380
You can help
yourself, though.

30:50.382 --> 30:54.084
Might reduce sentencing.
I didn't kill anybody!

30:54.086 --> 30:56.086
You shot a federal agent
three times in the chest!

30:56.088 --> 30:57.554
Bishop: Hey!
Take it down a peg.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.389
He said he didn't
kill anybody, okay?

30:59.391 --> 31:01.592
Let's hear him out.
Then you make it fast.

31:01.594 --> 31:03.861
Stalin: I did not
extort the government,

31:03.863 --> 31:06.330
And I did not kill
this agent.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.232
But I know who did.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.500
Name.
Edward gracy.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.002
He's sold me
info before.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.470
Corporate stuff,
tech secrets.

31:13.472 --> 31:16.073
This is the first time he's
offered government intel.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.374
Tony:
So you're admitting to treason.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.642
We supposed to believe this?

31:18.644 --> 31:21.211
I don't know
if I believe him at all.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.247
Need an address to prove it.

31:33.658 --> 31:35.525
Here you go.

31:47.405 --> 31:50.073
Hey, what about my deal?
Oh, you'll have to take
that up with your lawyer.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.341
You said you were my lawyer.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.410
No, I didn't.
Gave you my card.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.322
Mcgee: Is that gonna
hold up in court?

32:05.324 --> 32:07.357
I don't know.
I'm not a lawyer, either.

32:07.359 --> 32:10.661

the right thing, like I did,

40:04.503 --> 40:06.436
A bug at the nsa.

here is you, ward.

By hiring one of
your corporate spies

To embarrass me, you put
the entire country at risk.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.680
I had nothing to do with that.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.082

40:24.623 --> 40:25.855
And sacrifice.

Takes more than a uniform
to make a team.

Sorry to...
Bother you so late.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.651
Never say you're sorry.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.619
It is a sign of weakness.

that was the point.

41:00.225 --> 41:03.726
Especially after today.

41:03.728 --> 41:06.729

figured something out.

answer, don't you, bishop?

41:08.934 --> 41:10.500

41:10.502 --> 41:12.969

42:26.944 --> 42:29.279
Before I took the job at nsa.

42:29.281 --> 42:33.249
Your name sounded familiar;
I went back and looked it up.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.184
That's why
you brought me along today.

42:36.787 --> 42:37.921
You play chess, too.

42:40.024 --> 42:43.126
I wanted to see if you were
still up for a challenge.

42:43.128 --> 42:44.961
Why?

42:47.197 --> 42:49.766
