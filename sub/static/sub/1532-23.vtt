00:03.600 --> 00:05.762
I was told once that a man...

00:05.960 --> 00:07.849
...cannot live by two names.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.321
I thought that I could be me
and the Arrow...

00:10.520 --> 00:11.567
...but I can't.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.171
I see it in your eyes.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.442
The struggle you have
with your dual identity.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.846
I'm the Demon's Head.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.371
I want you to take my place.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.442
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.529
Oliver Queen is the Arrow.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.688
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.251
There is no more Arrow.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.403
Ra's took that from you.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.761
Take your rightful place
as heir to the Demon...

00:34.320 --> 00:36.607
...and Ra's al Ghul
will bring your sister back.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.281
All this time I've been struggling with...

00:39.480 --> 00:40.766
...who I am.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.086
Do you recognize this?

00:42.280 --> 00:44.248
The Alpha and Omega bioweapon.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.881
You will unleash this on Starling City.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.731
My son was killed by the virus...

00:49.880 --> 00:51.530
...Ra's intends to use on your city.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.650
Oliver.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.808
You asked us to trust you
and we trusted you.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.126
No, Oliver.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.568
You were asleep.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.047
I was dreaming.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.130
Ibn Sirin once wrote
there are three types of dreams.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.209
There are ones about truth...

01:26.400 --> 01:27.970
...there are ones about desire...

01:28.160 --> 01:31.004
...and there are ones about temptation.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.366
What did you dream of?

01:33.800 --> 01:35.006
Rebirth.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.730
As Ra's al Ghul.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.724
There is no greater burden
than the one you are about to take on.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.526
The annihilation of one's home.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.882
It is necessary to complete my ascension.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.771
I will be there to steady your hand
when the time comes.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.210
I appreciate your assistance.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.890
Soon...

01:53.080 --> 01:55.447
...you will wear this...

01:55.640 --> 01:57.847
...and you will command a multitude...

01:58.160 --> 01:59.969
...and I shall call you Ra's.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.969
Something's wrong.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.760
Not that I'm complaining,
but shouldn't we be dead by now?

02:31.960 --> 02:33.200
Oliver tried to kill us.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.646
Ra's tried.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.565
Oliver was forced to let him appear
to be successful.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.407
Now we're back to trust Oliver,
and while we're at it trust you too?

02:41.560 --> 02:45.406
Yeah. Last time I checked, you tried
to make a deal with Ra's to save yourself.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.447
In order for our plan to work,
Ra's' trust in Oliver had to be complete.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.291
And after that plane fiasco, it wasn't.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.168
Oliver needed to demonstrate...

02:58.400 --> 03:00.482
...one more time his loyalty to Ra's.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.007
Which I guess brings us back to...

03:03.240 --> 03:05.402
...why aren't we dead?
Not that I'm complaining.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.331
Oliver...

03:08.520 --> 03:11.569
...was vaccinated against
the Alpha/Omega virus...

03:11.720 --> 03:12.767
...five years ago.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.131
An associate was able to draw a version
of the vaccine from his blood.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.840
A synthetic skin graft.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.962
Upon our incarceration...

03:24.120 --> 03:26.327
...I was able to vaccinate...

03:26.520 --> 03:28.329
...each one of you cutaneously.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.280
I saved your lives.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.407
I believe the words you're searching for
are "thank" and "you."

03:40.120 --> 03:44.444
Okay. Assuming this is all some part
of a brilliant double-double cross...

03:44.640 --> 03:46.529
...or triple cross, I'm losing count...

03:46.680 --> 03:50.605
...your master plan still has one major flaw,
since we're still chained in a dungeon.

03:50.760 --> 03:51.966
Patience, Miss Smoak.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.288
All we have to do is wait.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.646
Wait for what?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.326
The thunder.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.322
Keep walking.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.204
It's time.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.286
All right.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.009
You guys have a hot tub?

04:28.240 --> 04:29.730
Nice.

04:32.760 --> 04:33.841
Hey, guys.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.885
Wow. I mean, this is, like...

04:39.080 --> 04:40.206
...a real dungeon.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.966
- Barry.
- Thank you, Felicity.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.528
You just outed my secret identity
to a super-villain.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.767
No offense.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.367
None taken.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.840
Now get us out of here.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.606
All right. Uh, stand back.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.727
Excellent.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.445
How many assassins do you figure?

05:02.600 --> 05:05.331
Uh, none. They're all taking
a little nappy-time.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.527
Thank you.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.888
Not to be greedy,
but we could really use your help...

05:09.040 --> 05:11.486
...on this Starling City super-virus thing.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.687
And you know I would...

05:12.880 --> 05:16.202
...but I am overdue for a very pointed
conversation with Harrison Wells.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.170
I'm sure Oliver's got this.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.401
I wouldn't count on it.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.245
Oliver hasn't been very forthcoming
with his plans lately.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.048
Well, I don't know what's been going on
with him lately...

05:27.200 --> 05:29.851
...apart from a recent wardrobe change...

05:30.040 --> 05:32.042
...but one thing that hasn't changed...

05:32.240 --> 05:33.810
...is he needs you guys.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.690
Even if he doesn't think so.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.650
Good luck.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.761
I'll never get used to that.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.481
Well, there goes our ride home.
Unh. John?

05:45.680 --> 05:49.002
The plane we came in is still secure,
but we need to get to it quickly.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.287
Come on.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.767
Tatsu.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.286
Let's go, we're leaving.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.887
I left a life of solitude
because Oliver asked it of me.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.526
It's time to return to it.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.005
I'm wired.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.527
In direct communication
with my men outside.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.848
I'm gonna count to five.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.081
One.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.609
- What's happening?
- Two engines are down.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.091
We're trying to compensate...

07:03.280 --> 07:05.726
...but they've been tampered with.
Sabotage.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.371
You!

07:13.320 --> 07:14.367
This is all your doing.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.487
Don't.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.284
Nyssa had nothing to do with this.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.807
You were delivered by the prophecy.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.804
You wed my daughter.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.408
Your name is Al Sah-him
and you are Warith Al Ghul.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.244
My name...

07:28.440 --> 07:30.522
...is Oliver Queen.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.131
Oliver Queen is dead.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.084
And soon you will be too.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.488
I handed you my crusade...

07:42.640 --> 07:44.051
...my holy mission.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.210
I already have one.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.449
Survive this...

08:31.640 --> 08:34.803
...and I will come for
you again and again...

08:34.960 --> 08:36.962
...until your end of days.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.207
But first...

08:38.360 --> 08:40.931
...your city will perish.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.325
It's our only parachute.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.962
Stay strapped in and do exactly as I say.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.210
All right, we've lost hydraulics.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.601
- Is there a red lever by your right leg?
- Yes.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.331
Okay, on my go.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.767
You pull it up and you turn it clockwise.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.047
Push it back down.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.281
- You understand?
- Yes.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.881
Three, two, one.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.690
Now!

09:32.680 --> 09:34.330
Back down.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.524
Nyssa, this is gonna hurt.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.648
Oh, no. I couldn't.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.889
He loved you.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.725
You were his friend.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.402
Excuse me.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.769
My people will be looking for me.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.609
It's just a matter of
time till they find me.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.770
- Do it.
- Do you remember Amanda Waller?

11:16.120 --> 11:19.966
Hm?
She's the reason that I'm in Hong Kong.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.281
She thought I had a special talent.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.283
She taught me things.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.283
Let me show you.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.205
We don't have much time.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.562
For what? I thought you said
Oliver had a plan.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.247
Yeah, and in the event that it
doesn't work, he has a backup.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.805
Us.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.243
John, let's determine the status
of our arsenal.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.641
Laurel, go to your father.
Start mobilizing the police.

11:49.800 --> 11:54.124
Mr. Palmer, I need you to find something
that will neutralize an airborne contagion.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.807
Miss Smoak, let's find out where
our League of Assassin friends might be.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.290
I'm sorry. Did I mumble?

12:02.480 --> 12:03.766
We follow his lead.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.687
For now.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.611
Guys? I set up a proximity alarm to detect
any unauthorized entry to this level.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.171
It's going off like crazy.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.485
Nyssa.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.529
Son of a bitch!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.968
It's okay. It's all right.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.800
Uh, maybe we should
give these guys the room.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.401
Nyssa looks happy.
Are you two on your honeymoon?

12:38.640 --> 12:40.529
What the hell's going on, Oliver?

12:40.760 --> 12:41.841
Start talking.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.890
The reason that I've kept Malcolm close
for the past several months...

12:45.040 --> 12:47.168
...is because he had critical intel
on our enemy.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.564
He knows Ra's. He knows the League.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.406
And he knew that if I was appointed
his successor...

12:52.640 --> 12:55.041
...that meant Starling City
was marked for death.

12:55.680 --> 12:59.321
The only way that we were gonna defeat
the League was from the inside.

12:59.680 --> 13:04.049
I had to get close enough to Ra's to find
out how he was gonna destroy the city...

13:04.280 --> 13:05.770
...and stop him.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.924
You trusted Malcolm Merlyn
more than the two people closest to you.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.366
John, it wasn't about trust.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.331
It was about making sure
that you and you were safe.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.731
- I had to keep the circle as small as possible.
- How did you expect to repair this...

13:17.880 --> 13:20.201
...once you got back?
I didn't.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.531
I flew with Ra's and the
virus to Starling...

13:24.720 --> 13:26.085
...and I sabotaged the plane.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.410
The plan...

13:30.120 --> 13:32.248
...was to kill Ra's and destroy the virus.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.521
It didn't work.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.690
How did you expect
to survive the plane crash?

13:38.840 --> 13:40.080
You didn't.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.241
You never expected
to have this conversation.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.211
You were planning on dying.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.570
So that was your big plan?

13:54.760 --> 13:56.922
Sacrificing yourself to take out Ra's.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.003
It was the only way.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.284
At least now that it didn't work,
I get a chance...

14:04.520 --> 14:06.443
...to tell both of you how sorry I am.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.602
Sorry won't cut it, Oliver.

14:09.920 --> 14:10.921
Not this time.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.929
But we have bigger problems...

14:17.120 --> 14:18.360
...than hurt feelings...

14:18.520 --> 14:20.124
...and broken trust.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.043
Laurel needs to contact her father.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.009
Ray needs to find a way
to counteract the virus.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.288
I'm sure Malcolm told you.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.965
We don't have a lot of time.

14:43.560 --> 14:44.607
Oliver.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.850
What have you done?

14:49.680 --> 14:52.445
He failed this city...

14:53.360 --> 14:56.170
...and I'm giving him the
justice he deserves.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.288
This isn't justice.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.164
It's...

15:00.320 --> 15:01.367
...wrong.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.288
He's still alive.

15:06.880 --> 15:09.326
Just passed out from the pain.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.527
What'd you find?

15:21.680 --> 15:24.684
My father isn't using any of the League's
ordinary redoubts in the city.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.083
If Ra's is here with the virus,
why hasn't he used it yet?

15:29.120 --> 15:30.406
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.643
Ra's is old school, every way I have
of finding him is new school.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.366
Maybe we need to change
the way we're looking for him.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.761
If you're trying to find a sub
that's gone dark...

15:38.920 --> 15:41.127
...you look for what's out of the ordinary
in the water.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.806
We look for what's unusual
and maybe that points us...

15:44.040 --> 15:46.361
...to how or where Ra's plans
to release the virus.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.126
Traffic lights were down for 2O minutes
at Adams and O'Neil.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.126
Computers at Starling Bank are offline.
The top floor of the Essex Hotel's closed.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.487
There's an electrical spike
at 52nd and Robson...

15:55.720 --> 15:59.406
Wait, go back.
The top floor of the Essex is closed?

15:59.600 --> 16:01.011
My father doesn't frequent hotels.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.329
According to e-mails, the floor
was shut down for a Damien Darhk.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.801
A name like that has to be an alias.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.604
Damien Darhk is in Starling City.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.001
My father's most bitter enemy.

16:11.160 --> 16:14.767
That's why Ra's hasn't released the virus.
He wants to use it to kill Damien Darhk.

16:14.920 --> 16:19.005
This was never just about my ascension.
Ra's wants to take out his nemesis.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.844
You weren't the only one
with a hidden agenda.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.162
This can work for us.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.922
Ra's wants Damien.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.687
So we give him Damien.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.241
We trade Damien for the virus?

16:32.440 --> 16:35.922
That is remarkably ruthless
and cold-blooded.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.805
I approve.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.891
I count two on the roof.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.730
One on the penthouse floor.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.725
I got two guarding the elevators.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.809
Another three going in and out
of the service entrance.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.010
And a patrol in the stairwell.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.089
Same for the northwest corridor.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.806
Keep Darhk's men from joining the party.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.082
Getting into position.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.971
Damien Darhk.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.686
You know, the hotel's going to bill me
for that window.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.444
Turn around.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.128
This is bold.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.321
Even for Ra's.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.648
- Ra's al Ghul wants you dead.
- Mm.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.968
He's planning a bio-weapon
to take you out.

17:56.120 --> 17:59.010
Ah. That's a considerable amount
of work to go to.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.881
Ra's certainly must want Mr. Darhk
off the board.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.245
You seem surprised.

18:06.480 --> 18:10.565
Mr. Darhk left Starling
the moment he learned of Ra's' intention.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.006
It's amusing.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.687
The Demon's Head thinks he can catch
my employer unawares.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.291
It's just my phone.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.091
Hello, Al Sah-him.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.051
Apparently, both our plans
did not go as we'd hoped.

18:31.680 --> 18:32.886
I'm gonna find you.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.611
It was a bold gambit,
hoping to leverage Mr. Darhk.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.529
One which would have
done you no good.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.924
I set in motion the death of your city
1O minutes ago.

18:42.160 --> 18:47.246
The Alpha/Omega shall be disseminated
by means of four vessels.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.050
Four instruments of death.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.204
And I doubt that you and your friends
will have time to stop all of them.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.289
Unlike you, Oliver Queen...

18:54.520 --> 18:56.443
...I am a man of my word.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.888
And I swore that you would see
your city perish.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.088
I told you I needed the DD-5s
for the Andreyko case...

19:08.240 --> 19:11.323
...on my desk. And unless I recently
went blind, they're not here.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.010
Now what...?

19:13.560 --> 19:15.847
I gotta put you on hold for a second.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.047
It won't be long.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.211
I thought you and I agreed
to give ourselves some space.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.762
- Not when the city is in danger.
- Heh. I don't have time for this.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.083
Wait, do you remember that chemical spill
in Hong Kong five years ago?

19:28.240 --> 19:31.528
It turns out it was a biological attack
and that bio-weapon...

19:31.720 --> 19:34.041
Let me guess, this is coming from
your buddy Queen? Huh?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.969
The city's under attack. Must be May.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.526
- What do you...?
- You still keep it in the middle drawer?

19:39.840 --> 19:41.922
- What?
- The bottle.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.370
I'm gonna bet that it's Scotch.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.685
It's not what you think it is.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.291
Don't.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.442
If you wanna drink, then drink.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.285
But don't just stand there and lie to me
right to my face.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.124
Doesn't feel good, does it?

20:00.360 --> 20:01.521
It makes you thirsty.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.284
I love you.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.485
No matter what happens between us,
that will never change.

20:08.280 --> 20:12.285
You can hate me for lying. You can blame
Oliver for Sara. You can even blame me.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.684
But falling off the wagon, that's on you.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.491
I got it under control.
Two drinks a day, that's it.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.688
We're alcoholics, Dad, drunks.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.566
There's no such thing as two drinks a day.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.404
And now you have a choice.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.803
You can keep drinking,
and keep being angry at me and Oliver...

20:30.080 --> 20:32.003
...or the rest of the world if you want.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.243
Or you can make
both of your daughters proud...

20:35.400 --> 20:38.643
...and throw away the bottle
and help save this city.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.482
John, Malcolm and Nyssa
are on their way back.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.523
- What happened with Darhk?
- He was gone.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.802
The man that I found was a cut out.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.406
Ra's plans to release the virus
at four points in the city.

20:54.640 --> 20:58.531
I worked out a system that can neutralize
the virus if we can get our hands on it.

20:58.680 --> 21:02.526
We need four of them and a way to spread
the inoculant if this gets out of control.

21:02.680 --> 21:06.207
I scrubbed through the information
Malcolm gave us on the Hong Kong attack.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.921
The virus gave off a low-level emission
from its RNA, almost like radiation.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.283
If you hack the satellite,
you could tune the band to search for it.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.442
Which you've been doing
the last five minutes.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.241
We need probable locations where he would
release the virus as soon as you get them.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.731
Mm-hm.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.847
Maseo?

21:29.480 --> 21:31.369
Where are you going?

21:31.880 --> 21:33.723
I don't know.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.008
All I know...

21:36.200 --> 21:38.567
...is I wasn't strong enough...

21:38.720 --> 21:40.085
...to save my son.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.411
Or to do what Oliver did.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.006
What Oliver did was horrible.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.490
He allowed himself to become a monster.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.483
No more of a monster than I am.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.245
I am...

21:55.480 --> 21:56.845
...without a soul, Tatsu.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.723
Only if you abandon your wife...

22:01.000 --> 22:02.570
...when she needs you the most.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.922
Every time...

22:05.640 --> 22:08.246
...I look in your eyes...

22:10.240 --> 22:11.924
...I see my son's.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.842
I see my failure.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.087
I love you.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.767
I'm not worthy of that love.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.921
Where's he going?

22:28.560 --> 22:31.211
Somewhere we cannot follow.

22:38.760 --> 22:43.527
I know I said I would never, ever
bring you coffee again...

22:43.960 --> 22:49.091
...but the city facing a bio-weapon attack
seemed like a valid exception.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.443
So your plan to take out Ra's by dying...

22:57.120 --> 22:58.610
...we should talk about that.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.050
Every night since the mountain...

23:02.240 --> 23:03.685
...I've had the same dream.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.121
You are...

23:05.320 --> 23:08.483
...pleading with me not to go face Ra's,
and I listen to you.

23:08.920 --> 23:14.245
Sometimes, the dream still ends badly.
I end up with this sword in my chest.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.890
But...

23:16.480 --> 23:18.209
...most of the time we escape.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.928
And we're just driving.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.006
And all this seems...

23:27.720 --> 23:31.486
It seems so far away, because it's just...

23:32.960 --> 23:34.007
It's the two of us.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.246
I know you think that's not possible.

23:39.800 --> 23:44.601
That you dead and Ra's dead
is the only realistic best-case scenario.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.689
Felicity...

23:49.360 --> 23:52.011
...I can't defeat Ra's al Ghul.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.209
Oliver Queen can't.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.761
The Arrow can't.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.491
Both those men tried
and both those men failed.

24:02.760 --> 24:06.003
Do you remember what you said to me
during our night in Nanda Parbat?

24:08.800 --> 24:10.689
You're no longer either of those men.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.369
You've become...

24:16.640 --> 24:17.880
...someone else.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.723
Become something else.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.723
This...

24:25.720 --> 24:27.882
...is different now.

24:28.240 --> 24:33.121
Because despite your best efforts,
you've allowed yourself to feel something.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.045
I know you think
that that's a weakness, it's not.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.289
It's your key...

24:40.480 --> 24:41.766
...to beating Ra's.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.087
Don't fight to die.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.480
Fight to live.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.762
Satellite trace is back.
I got four locations.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.524
Okay, let's go.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.881
Felicity?

25:08.880 --> 25:10.211
Thank you.

25:12.560 --> 25:15.040
All right, yeah, got them.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.451
I don't know, we'll talk about that later.

25:21.920 --> 25:26.801
I need all units, I need ESU, all squad
cars converging on these four locations.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.122
We got a potential bio-weapons attack.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.929
I'm on site.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.121
On site.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.129
On site.

25:41.960 --> 25:45.760
I'm on site, but I have no idea
what I should be looking for out here.

25:46.280 --> 25:49.409
See anyone in a League of Assassins outfit?
That'd be a dead giveaway.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.084
I have no weapons.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.770
And I have no virus.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.086
Ra's al Ghul awaits you
on the Starling City Dam.

26:03.280 --> 26:07.330
He wishes to be in your presence
as your city dies.

26:07.480 --> 26:11.644
And what makes him think that I won't
just stay focused on saving my city?

26:11.840 --> 26:15.561
Because he knows of your deluded belief
that you can defeat him in battle.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.047
And you know...

26:17.200 --> 26:19.123
...that as long as the
Demon's Head lives...

26:19.320 --> 26:21.288
...he will continue to threaten your home.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.762
- I got a runner carrying a briefcase.
- The bio-weapon's in the briefcase.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.841
I'm scrubbing footage from surveillance
cameras at the remaining three locations.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.406
You okay?

27:07.840 --> 27:09.490
Don't move.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.728
- Nice threads.
- Thanks.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.810
Felicity, the briefcase is empty.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.485
It's empty-

27:25.240 --> 27:28.722
Where's the virus?

27:34.560 --> 27:36.528
He is the weapon.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.087
Ra's is using his own men
to disperse the virus.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.765
And we will not be stopped.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.408
For the will of Ra's al Ghul...

27:45.600 --> 27:46.931
...is our own.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.764
No, no, no!

27:53.760 --> 27:55.762
I knew you couldn't resist.

27:55.960 --> 28:00.090
The man who survives the sword
of Ra's al Ghul...

28:00.400 --> 28:02.368
...shall become Ra's al Ghul.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.204
So you brought me here to kill you?

28:04.400 --> 28:07.085
Either way, I am victorious.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.966
You either ascend to Ra's
as I have designed...

28:10.160 --> 28:11.446
...or you will die.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.602
And the last thing you will ever see...

28:13.760 --> 28:16.127
...is your beloved city...

28:16.280 --> 28:18.282
...succumbing to disease and death.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.729
Get back! Go, go, gp!

28:21.920 --> 28:22.967
Get back, go!

28:23.120 --> 28:24.451
Go, run!

28:30.600 --> 28:32.011
Go, go, go!

28:32.600 --> 28:33.647
Get back, go, go!

28:33.800 --> 28:34.847
Go, go, go!

28:36.280 --> 28:38.123
Everybody get back!

28:38.280 --> 28:42.046
- We gotta get out of here.
- Malcolm inoculated me. Oh, my God.

28:42.240 --> 28:45.961
Starling City appears to be in the throes
of a biological attack.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.208
Outbreak at Nelson Plaza. It's bad.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.330
The virus spreads when infected blood
is exposed to open air.

28:51.720 --> 28:55.770
Even if we find Ra's' men, how do we
stop them from spreading the virus?

28:55.960 --> 29:00.887
Temporary solution. Get them off the streets, in
a secure place, don't let them cut themselves.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.929
Wait, you're not inoculated.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.360
This is my father's doing.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.806
I will see it undone.

29:08.120 --> 29:11.249
You choose a sword
that has already defeated you in battle.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.162
Miss Smoak,
I've taken out one of Ra's' men.

29:37.680 --> 29:38.681
Don't take chances.

29:38.920 --> 29:42.891
Put that body someplace airtight. And try
not to kill anyone else while you're at it.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.441
The virus is spreading.
Can you replicate the inoculant?

29:45.920 --> 29:49.720
That's the easy part. The hard part is
disseminating it over a three-block radius.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.689
Your nanotech.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.080
Can you make them airborne?

29:53.320 --> 29:55.368
That is what I'm trying to do.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.729
I have been a most excellent trainer.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.801
We need to get this guy somewhere
he can't infect anyone.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.805
What the hell's going on here?

30:25.960 --> 30:28.406
We're in the middle of a crisis.
I don't have time for this.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.251
Two suspects on the dam.
Don't know why they're fighting.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.562
Chief says they're responsible
for what's happening.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.331
He ordered me to take them out
as soon as I have a shot.

30:52.840 --> 30:55.081
Something has changed within you, boy.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.444
Your will to live burns brighter, and yet
you rejected my offer of eternal life.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.921
What you were offering wasn't living.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.801
Power serves you no interest.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.211
You'd rather love.

31:20.520 --> 31:23.126
A man who condemns his daughter
to death...

31:23.280 --> 31:24.770
...wouldn't understand.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.767
- Detective? I mean, captain.
- We got a problem.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.407
- You're gonna have to be more specific.
- Your boy's at Starling City Dam.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.484
I got officers not listening to me
getting ready to shoot him.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.404
Despite what I think about your guy...

31:39.560 --> 31:42.325
...I don't want him killed
while he's trying to save this city.

31:42.480 --> 31:46.041
Unless you order up a miracle pretty quick,
that's exactly what's gonna happen.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.170
- Got number four.
- Hold on a second, we have a new problem.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.846
You have to get to Starling City Dam.
You have to fly.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.122
I'm uploading the operating code
to the nanotech.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.011
I'm still rewriting on the fly.
I can't leave this station.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.401
- Why?
- Oliver's in trouble, he needs help.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.967
If I can't get the nanotech
to disperse the inoculant...

32:02.160 --> 32:05.801
...thousands of people in this city will die.
- What? No, Ray, Oliver.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.810
It's one life against the city's.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.049
What would Oliver do?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.002
Unlike you...

32:14.200 --> 32:18.762
...thousands of honorable men will mourn
my death when I leave this Earth.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.166
No.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.363
They will kneel...

32:33.560 --> 32:35.881
...before the next Ra's Al Ghul.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.082
I knew I chose well with you, boy.

33:43.440 --> 33:47.604
If I could figure out how to get this thing
off, I would be kissing you right now.

33:55.960 --> 34:00.329
The casualty count would have been much
higher if not for an airborne inoculant...

34:00.520 --> 34:04.570
...that rumors credit Palmer Technologies
with developing.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.165
You killed my father.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.690
I had to.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.400
I wanted to be the one.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.800
You're lucky you're still alive.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.929
You wouldn't be had you not been wearing
League armor.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.960
I like to think I had something
to do with that.

34:28.679 --> 34:30.603
When I started this...

34:30.800 --> 34:33.643
...I wanted to keep you
as far away from it as possible.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.085
Because that has always been
my instinct...

34:39.520 --> 34:40.806
...to go it alone.

34:41.920 --> 34:45.891
But the truth is that we won tonight
because I wasn't alone.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.482
I thought that this crusade
would only end with my death.

34:51.679 --> 34:54.922
But even if I had died tonight,
it would live on because of you.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.001
And you.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.403
- Oh. And you.
- It's true.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.609
- This city isn't lacking masks.
- Heroes.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.883
Which is why I no longer need to be one.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.888
- What are you saying?
- Ra's took the Arrow identity from me.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.127
I couldn't...

35:20.360 --> 35:23.250
...be that person even if I wanted to be.

35:24.960 --> 35:26.371
And I don't want to be.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.367
I told you that...

35:31.680 --> 35:33.728
...I couldn't be the Arrow and be with you.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.482
I want to be with you.

35:39.880 --> 35:44.010
You told me that I have become
someone else, and I would like to...

35:44.880 --> 35:47.770
...maybe discover a little more
about that person.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.241
If you'll come with me.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.647
With you where?

35:54.120 --> 35:55.884
Um...

35:56.040 --> 35:58.566
Someplace far away from here.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.765
Even without me...

36:01.440 --> 36:03.681
...Starling still has heroes
to watch over it.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.411
John?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.723
I'll talk to him.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.441
Wow.

36:17.600 --> 36:21.491
Yeah. That's the word I've been saying
over and over in my head.

36:23.480 --> 36:26.768
So does that mean
I'm gonna have to find a new...

36:26.960 --> 36:28.166
...vice president?

36:28.320 --> 36:29.446
I think so.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.771
I hope that you find someone
who makes you happy, Ray.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.440
You deserve that.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.444
- John?
- I'm happy for you, Oliver.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.123
Despite our issues...

36:48.840 --> 36:50.968
...you deserve to be happy.
You and Felicity.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.163
And you're right, the city's in good hands.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.486
Including yours.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.167
- I'm no superhero.
- You're a hero.

36:58.480 --> 37:01.131
For three years, you've been a rock.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.010
The city's rock, my rock.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.329
For three years,
you have been the person I can count on.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.211
I'm still counting on you.

37:11.760 --> 37:15.526
I don't know if I can get past
what happened between the two of us.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.170
I'm not asking you to.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.326
I'll think on it.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.200
Okay.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.010
John.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.240
Ahem. If you're gonna keep going...

37:32.800 --> 37:36.247
...you may wanna find a way to conceal
your identity when you're out there.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.845
I'll think on that too.

37:42.680 --> 37:45.160
- You be well, Oliver.
- You too.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.729
Where will you go?

37:52.920 --> 37:54.365
Kumamoto.

37:54.520 --> 37:58.127
There's a monastery there,
near my childhood home.

37:58.320 --> 38:03.042
I had always hoped to show it to Akio
when we returned to Japan as a family.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.362
I'm so very sorry, Tatsu.

38:07.880 --> 38:10.406
And where will you go?

38:10.640 --> 38:11.880
Back to Starling City?

38:14.080 --> 38:16.128
I tortured Shrieve...

38:16.320 --> 38:18.368
...for hours.

38:18.960 --> 38:22.043
I don't want that darkness
around my mother or my sister.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.283
What of your father?

38:24.480 --> 38:26.005
You told me about his message.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.167
His hope that you would save your city.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.402
I'm not the man my father thinks I am.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.122
Even if I was...

38:35.680 --> 38:37.603
...I should be alone.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.086
I need to be alone.

38:48.600 --> 38:49.681
Be well, Tatsu.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.649
He's upstairs...

39:04.840 --> 39:06.604
...packing.

39:07.120 --> 39:09.361
I'll be leaving Starling as well.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.603
Try to imagine my profound
disappointment.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.765
Thea, I love you.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.440
I know my actions
always haven't shown that.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.643
But I am your father...

39:22.200 --> 39:25.329
...and whatever you need,
I will always be there for you.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.482
Yeah, well, don't wait by the phone.

39:28.840 --> 39:31.923
But a year ago...

39:32.120 --> 39:34.851
...you told me that you could
teach me to be strong.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.642
You've made good by that promise.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.726
Are you sure you really want to do this?

39:46.880 --> 39:48.803
As sure as I was the last five times
you asked me.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.649
Be safe out there, okay?

39:53.280 --> 39:56.363
As safe as anybody
with a mask on can be.

39:58.320 --> 40:01.005
But actually I was thinking, um...

40:01.160 --> 40:04.721
...maybe I'd call myself the Red Arrow.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.291
Hm.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.647
I think I already told everyone
to call you Speedy.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.727
As we agreed.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.531
We've come a long way, you and I.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.721
I've always looked at you as a son, Oliver.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.490
And I'm glad we got to work together.

40:38.680 --> 40:39.841
To trust as we did.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.521
I will never forgive you...

40:44.720 --> 40:47.200
...for what you did to Sara.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.442
To my sister.

40:51.800 --> 40:52.881
Even

40:53.040 --> 40:55.042
Does that mean we're enemies once more?

40:55.520 --> 40:59.127
That depends on what you do
with your end of the bargain.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.405
Open new file.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.570
Atom project, update Gamma.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.205
Had an interesting breakthrough...

41:17.360 --> 41:21.285
...while repurposing nanotechnology
for antiviral dissemination.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.930
With the proper modifications...

41:24.160 --> 41:27.448
...the nanotech can be applied
to the miniaturization of key components...

41:27.600 --> 41:29.125
...of the suit.

41:30.240 --> 41:33.847
This will be miniaturization
test number one.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.925
Execute.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.487
Why can't anything
ever work on the first try?

41:41.680 --> 41:42.966
Hm?

42:12.320 --> 42:14.971
At least admit this was
your goal all along.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.807
My only aspiration was to free myself
of your father's grasp.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.651
A feat we both managed to achieve.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.322
I don't see how it was possible
in your case.

42:25.520 --> 42:28.091
When I was your father's captive
three months ago...

42:28.280 --> 42:29.964
...he tortured me with his blade.

42:30.320 --> 42:33.210
And you survived because my father
chose to release you.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.890
Funny thing, prophecies.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.247
Fate and my father have shown you mercy.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.484
I will not.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.211
You took Sara from me,
and I will have justice.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.169
You are welcome to try.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.488
Until then...

42:47.720 --> 42:50.530
...kneel before Ra's al Ghul.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.767
My name is Oliver Queen.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.843
After five years in hell...

43:11.000 --> 43:13.401
...I returned home with only one goal.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.842
To save my city.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.525
And I did.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.007
I became a hero who helped people.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.680
But now it's time for me
to be someone else.

43:22.840 --> 43:26.765
It's time for me to be something else.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.368
So where are we going?

43:34.520 --> 43:38.286
I'm thinking a state that can annul
a Nanda Parbat marriage.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.451
Can I say something strange?

43:44.040 --> 43:45.769
I'm happy.
