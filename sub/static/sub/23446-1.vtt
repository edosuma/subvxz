00:33.534 --> 00:35.736
--casualties have been medevacked.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.472
Live from Shibuya.

00:38.539 --> 00:42.776
I can see many cars ablaze
at Shibuya Crossing.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.646
The destruction is like a war zone.

00:46.380 --> 00:50.817
--the area is closed off.
The cause remains unknown.

02:27.781 --> 02:28.782
Kurono!

02:31.218 --> 02:32.319
Your suit!

02:46.767 --> 02:47.634
Don't.

02:48.368 --> 02:49.736
Someone has to.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.171
But you can't!

02:53.440 --> 02:54.474
I have to!

02:55.308 --> 02:56.610
Who else will?

03:01.548 --> 03:02.716
Kurono!

03:34.448 --> 03:35.449
Kurono.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.885
How's Pop?

03:45.325 --> 03:46.326
He's alive!

03:48.895 --> 03:51.331
Good...

03:58.338 --> 04:01.341
Kurono? Please...

04:01.675 --> 04:04.878
Kurono! Kurono!

04:09.649 --> 04:11.952
No! I don't want to go!

04:12.018 --> 04:13.820
Kurono!

04:44.050 --> 04:46.653
See my shiny and wavy hair.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.823
Enrich your hair.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.393
NEWSFLASH
OSAKA IS IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY

04:53.460 --> 04:55.529
What's going on in Osaka?

04:55.896 --> 04:59.332
Maybe it's monsters, like in Shibuya?

05:01.601 --> 05:04.437
-OSAKA'S IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY.
-YOU OKAY?

05:04.504 --> 05:06.706
LIKE THE KILLINGS IN TOKYO.

05:08.608 --> 05:11.978
It contains super rich
hyaluronic acid, Akatsuki.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.914
-IS IT THE U.S. MILITARY?
-IT'S MASSACRE!

05:25.592 --> 05:28.762
Ayumu, I'm in Shinjuku.
I'll catch a train.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.433
You're late. What have you been doing?

05:33.767 --> 05:34.935
I'm sorry.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.506
Do you remember what today is?

05:43.577 --> 05:44.544
What is it?

05:56.723 --> 05:58.058
He has a knife!

06:00.594 --> 06:01.494
Police!

06:06.433 --> 06:07.367
There!

06:15.442 --> 06:16.776
Where are you hurt?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.646
You'll be okay.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.175
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AYUMU

07:11.831 --> 07:14.200
Am I alive?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.013
Hey, you--

07:29.849 --> 07:32.085
Are you in shock?

07:34.821 --> 07:35.755
I got...

07:36.957 --> 07:37.891
stabbed.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.026
You were?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.600
I dropped dead from a stroke.

07:48.201 --> 07:51.705
Reika here was in a car accident.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.076
Reika...

07:57.143 --> 07:58.111
The star?

07:58.611 --> 08:01.681
Oh, yeah. She's a big deal, right?

08:02.082 --> 08:05.552
I'm a bit out of touch,

08:05.919 --> 08:08.588
but I saw her in a TV ad.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.091
What was it? Shampoo...

08:11.157 --> 08:13.259
Oh, please. Who cares?

08:15.862 --> 08:19.032
Aren't you her fan, Nishi?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.101
I know you schoolboys...

08:21.167 --> 08:22.669
Shut up, Baldy.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.709
What's your name?

08:33.279 --> 08:35.081
Masaru Kato.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.052
My name is Suzuki.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.554
Nice to meet you.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.289
What's going on?

08:44.124 --> 08:45.592
Explain!

08:48.528 --> 08:50.230
It's hard to believe,

08:50.930 --> 08:54.768
but we all died before.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.536
What...?

08:56.603 --> 08:58.638
You told me the same thing.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.574
It makes no sense to me!

09:02.242 --> 09:06.246
Rise and shine
It's a new morning for us

09:06.312 --> 09:10.216
A morning of new hope

09:10.617 --> 09:14.587
Breathe in
A chest full of joy

09:14.654 --> 09:18.558
Look up at the clear, blue sky!

09:18.625 --> 09:20.994
Listen to the radio

09:21.060 --> 09:22.562
What's this?

09:22.829 --> 09:26.800
The summer breeze
It is so wholesome

09:26.866 --> 09:30.937
Breathe in and exercise now

09:31.004 --> 09:34.240
To the count of one, two and three

09:37.210 --> 09:40.647
Your old lives have ended.

09:44.350 --> 09:49.956
I will decide how to use your new lives.
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

09:52.025 --> 09:56.129
Go now and finish off this guy.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.698
Nurarihyon.

10:01.901 --> 10:04.370
HE KICKS ASS. HE WON'T GIVE UP.
KILL HIM IN GIVEN TIME.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.941
Oh, no. He looks tough!

10:08.741 --> 10:10.710
What is this thing?

10:11.945 --> 10:14.914
This black orb is... Gantz.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.050
Gantz?

10:17.750 --> 10:21.821
I don't know why,
but that's what everyone calls it.

10:26.659 --> 10:27.894
What the hell?

10:29.028 --> 10:31.030
Are these toy guns?

10:32.365 --> 10:35.335
"Kato-cha, LOL." Is this mine?

10:37.003 --> 10:42.075
You two first-timers
had better get dressed now.

10:42.141 --> 10:46.212
Don't tell me what to do, Baldy!

10:55.355 --> 10:58.758
Morons like him always die first.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.795
What's that, punk?

11:03.062 --> 11:05.365
You're just a stupid gamer.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.769
You have an attitude, school kid.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.441
I'm talking to you, punk!

11:16.342 --> 11:17.977
-Nishi!
-Don't!

11:32.825 --> 11:33.993
I told you.

11:34.060 --> 11:34.994
Nishi!

11:35.361 --> 11:37.964
He would have only dragged us down.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.105
This guy looks useless, too.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.307
Are you okay?

11:47.974 --> 11:50.076
Put on the gear, Kato!

11:51.044 --> 11:52.211
Who are you?

11:54.113 --> 11:58.484
We're stuck playing
an endless survival game.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.920
A survival game?

12:00.987 --> 12:04.357
You must have seen it on the news.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.827
You know the monster in Shibuya...?

12:08.261 --> 12:10.363
We fight the monsters.

12:10.930 --> 12:15.768
You mean,
you're the ones in the black suits?

12:17.103 --> 12:18.471
In the previous game,

12:19.172 --> 12:24.043
our toughest members
were eliminated unfortunately.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.913
We lost our leader.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.918
Gantz, beam me out of here.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.790
Hurry up, Kato!

12:44.998 --> 12:47.133
Quickly, please!

12:53.906 --> 12:55.875
Put it on!

13:45.958 --> 13:47.226
Are you okay?

13:53.099 --> 13:55.168
Wait a minute...

13:56.069 --> 13:57.136
DOTONBORI

13:57.203 --> 13:58.104
We're...

13:59.906 --> 14:01.107
This is Osaka!

14:02.375 --> 14:06.012
But we're always sent to Tokyo!

14:46.552 --> 14:49.455
She's out of range, moron.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.180
Are you okay?

15:15.548 --> 15:17.583
You guys are useless.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.555
Sorry, I totally panicked.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.590
What's going on?

15:25.424 --> 15:27.360
Explain it to me.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.694
Fuck off.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.497
What's going on? What is she?

15:32.131 --> 15:34.200
-Why us?
-Wait, Nishi!

15:34.600 --> 15:36.435
I'll tell him.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.413
Why do we have to fight them?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.649
And who are they?

15:50.349 --> 15:52.185
We don't know.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.954
We only know one thing.

15:55.254 --> 16:00.159
We have to kill all the enemies
before our time runs out.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.463
What if we don't?

16:05.565 --> 16:06.432
Then...

16:10.403 --> 16:12.538
We'd all die.

16:12.605 --> 16:13.739
But...

16:15.174 --> 16:16.409
For real.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.113
We'd no longer exist in the world.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.417
That's the Gantz rules.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.587
What do you mean, rules?

16:31.090 --> 16:31.991
Oh, no!

16:33.159 --> 16:34.560
Impossible!

16:55.448 --> 16:56.482
Come here.

17:32.351 --> 17:33.419
This way.

18:19.665 --> 18:21.667
Kato, go ahead and shoot!

18:33.245 --> 18:34.380
Kato!

18:48.828 --> 18:49.795
I'm okay?

18:50.796 --> 18:53.266
The suit protected you. Come on!

19:03.442 --> 19:04.677
Who did it?

19:07.179 --> 19:09.749
-He's lying!
-Are you?

19:28.734 --> 19:30.403
Who are they?

19:30.936 --> 19:34.373
You have a Tokyo accent.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.643
Are you the Osaka team?

19:37.710 --> 19:39.245
Osaka team?

19:39.745 --> 19:41.480
So, there are more?

19:42.248 --> 19:44.683
How come you don't know that?

19:45.384 --> 19:47.887
This is his first game.

19:50.623 --> 19:54.560
A novice, a kid, a middle-aged man,
and a woman.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.562
How pathetic.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.236
Ouch!

20:04.303 --> 20:06.439
Is he okay?

20:06.939 --> 20:10.910
As long as you're still alive,
you'll get back all your limbs

20:11.410 --> 20:14.513
when the stage is cleared.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.248
What...?

20:16.315 --> 20:20.619
How about that tough guy
who's called Kuro or something?

20:20.686 --> 20:21.987
He's dead.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.825
Wait a minute!

20:26.826 --> 20:27.860
It's Reika!

20:27.927 --> 20:30.963
Man! Look at the jugs on her!

20:31.230 --> 20:31.931
Shit!

20:36.469 --> 20:38.671
Hey, the Tokyo team's not bad.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.875
More of them!

20:42.942 --> 20:44.610
Here we go!

20:53.419 --> 20:55.855
You just sit and watch, wimps.

21:02.528 --> 21:06.332
Reika, watch us finish them off.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.801
Then we can swap numbers.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.670
Come on, George!

21:15.307 --> 21:17.643
There are so many of them!

21:17.943 --> 21:20.412
I'll go for the right side.

21:20.646 --> 21:22.414
How about you?

22:26.812 --> 22:29.381
They're enjoying this...

22:39.825 --> 22:43.462
That's worth points. I'll have it.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.928
How about that, Reika?

23:20.866 --> 23:23.636
The Osaka team is tough.

23:24.036 --> 23:27.473
What's that weapon and the bike thing?

23:30.142 --> 23:35.047
You can get superior weapons
if you score 100 points.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.782
One hundred points...?

23:37.683 --> 23:39.552
After defeating the enemies,

23:40.019 --> 23:44.056
we're teleported back to the room
to get scored.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.759
100-POINT MENU

23:46.825 --> 23:49.461
If you get 100, you win the game.

23:52.898 --> 23:57.002
Gantz gives you three bonus options.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.537
Like what?

24:00.172 --> 24:02.207
Like superior weapons.

24:02.741 --> 24:05.444
Or resurrect a dead teammate.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.913
You can bring them back?

24:08.447 --> 24:11.583
Apparently. I've never done it.

24:11.650 --> 24:12.851
And the third option?

24:13.652 --> 24:14.787
3. HAVE YOUR MEMORY WIPED AND QUIT.

24:14.853 --> 24:15.854
Graduation.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.590
You'll be free!

24:18.657 --> 24:19.692
Free?

24:20.693 --> 24:24.129
Score 100 points
and you can leave this all behind.

24:24.596 --> 24:29.668
You'll forget all about the Gantz games
and go back to your regular life.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.006
Anyway, it's good, isn't it?

24:34.673 --> 24:37.576
We won't have to do anything.

24:38.043 --> 24:41.046
The Osaka guys will wipe out the monsters.

24:41.547 --> 24:46.952
I'll let them have the small ones,
and I'll take the Boss at the end.

24:50.489 --> 24:55.828
Nishi's strategy is to hide and wait
for the strongest one at the end.

24:56.195 --> 24:59.832
Killing the Boss scores you
a lot of points.

25:00.933 --> 25:01.900
Help!

25:10.542 --> 25:12.745
We have to help those people.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.713
Come on, Suzuki.

25:15.914 --> 25:18.784
We should avoid any unnecessary risks.

25:18.851 --> 25:19.818
Suzuki!

25:21.520 --> 25:23.822
-But isn't that what you do?
-Well...

25:23.889 --> 25:25.691
Not without our leader...

25:25.958 --> 25:27.059
Come on!

25:30.629 --> 25:33.565
We're not tough enough
to protect other people.

25:47.679 --> 25:52.017
We can leave it to the Osaka team...

25:52.918 --> 25:56.889
so that we can just concentrate
on surviving, okay?

25:58.057 --> 26:01.059
Kato, wait! Kato!

26:05.831 --> 26:09.068
If you must go, keep this.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.773
Someone's waiting for your call.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.844
There are still some pay phones around.

26:24.049 --> 26:27.986
Make sure that you don't die.

26:58.784 --> 26:59.985
It's good.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.655
All the sauce we want!

27:12.931 --> 27:15.701
Do you see that there?

27:19.705 --> 27:20.772
Yeah...

27:22.307 --> 27:24.109
It's no Biriken statue.

27:32.017 --> 27:33.819
He's spooky.

27:47.699 --> 27:49.167
The Kato residence.

27:51.403 --> 27:52.704
Hello?

27:54.740 --> 27:56.875
Ayumu, it's me.

27:58.143 --> 28:01.313
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.348
Sorry.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.251
I was called into work.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.288
On a night like this?

28:09.922 --> 28:12.257
With what's happening in Osaka?

28:15.994 --> 28:17.796
What's happening there?

28:18.697 --> 28:21.700
Some monsters are running wild in Osaka.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.703
Really?

28:25.871 --> 28:27.105
I had no idea.

28:28.273 --> 28:32.044
How is that even possible?
Anyway, just come home.

28:33.745 --> 28:34.746
Sorry.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.282
It'll be a while.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.120
Okay, see you later.

28:42.187 --> 28:43.121
Ayumu.

28:44.756 --> 28:45.791
What?

28:49.261 --> 28:50.896
I will come home.

28:52.497 --> 28:56.101
I know that!
I'll eat first, then go to bed.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.287
It's here!

29:29.401 --> 29:30.402
Damn it!

30:41.573 --> 30:43.075
Hi there!

30:47.179 --> 30:49.281
You with the Tokyo team?

30:51.149 --> 30:52.217
Right.

30:53.018 --> 30:57.022
I'm Anzu Yamasaki,
from the Osaka team. And you?

30:59.424 --> 31:01.159
I'm Masaru Kato.

31:02.127 --> 31:05.097
How old are you? I'm 23.

31:06.231 --> 31:07.332
Seventeen.

31:07.966 --> 31:11.370
A high-school boy! You're just a kid.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.075
I've been watching you.

31:18.310 --> 31:21.346
I got really curious about...

31:21.913 --> 31:24.149
what you were doing.

31:26.017 --> 31:28.553
I'm sure I'm wrong, but...

31:29.354 --> 31:32.524
Did you just save that family?

31:34.659 --> 31:37.028
What were you really doing?

31:37.929 --> 31:38.930
Well...

31:40.098 --> 31:41.633
I saved the family.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.070
Oh, my God, it's impossible!

31:45.137 --> 31:46.104
I did.

31:46.171 --> 31:48.306
No! No one does that.

31:48.673 --> 31:49.975
But I did!

31:50.642 --> 31:54.379
Would you just watch someone get killed?

31:57.315 --> 31:58.550
Phony Alien!

32:03.989 --> 32:05.657
Are you upset?

32:06.425 --> 32:07.692
I'll help people.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.162
Quit it.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.697
You hypocrite.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.167
Don't follow me.

32:16.068 --> 32:20.272
Lighten up. I love watching weirdos.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.609
You're funny.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.614
I know you won't last long.

32:33.318 --> 32:34.586
I just remembered.

32:35.487 --> 32:39.124
I saw a kid hiding with some old people.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.593
I hope they're okay.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.261
Where are they?

32:45.263 --> 32:47.165
You're such a show-off!

32:50.535 --> 32:55.040
Don't cry or the monsters will get us.

32:55.373 --> 32:58.476
We're finished. It's just like hell.

32:59.077 --> 33:01.446
It's okay if I die...

33:01.513 --> 33:04.549
but not the boy.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.419
His life's just begun.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.088
I want to take him to his parents.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.760
Get away from it!

33:16.328 --> 33:19.231
You run! I'll take care of it!

33:19.297 --> 33:20.565
Honey!

33:31.176 --> 33:32.611
Honey!

33:37.516 --> 33:38.450
Honey!

33:46.191 --> 33:47.058
There they are.

33:48.593 --> 33:51.029
Are you okay? I'll save you!

33:51.663 --> 33:53.064
Back away!

33:56.668 --> 33:57.669
Run!

33:58.169 --> 34:00.205
No. I'll save them!

34:00.272 --> 34:03.208
No way. You can't beat him!

34:07.279 --> 34:08.346
I'll save them.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.514
Don't you dare!

34:11.815 --> 34:13.752
I know you're scared.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.822
You'll die, you blockhead!

34:20.625 --> 34:24.295
Stop! He'll seriously kill you!

34:24.629 --> 34:25.730
You idiot!

34:30.101 --> 34:32.437
He can die if he wants to.

34:32.504 --> 34:35.607
He's just a hopeless moron...

34:37.309 --> 34:41.079
He is kind of cute though.

34:43.148 --> 34:45.550
Is there anything I can do, boy?

34:46.117 --> 34:47.252
Just move away.

34:48.152 --> 34:50.221
Idiots like that are rare.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.190
One of a kind...

35:01.866 --> 35:03.401
Get back!

35:05.503 --> 35:06.671
What's this?

35:10.175 --> 35:12.711
Maybe I'm scared...

35:15.213 --> 35:16.781
...to see him die.

35:38.603 --> 35:39.771
How can I beat him?

35:43.842 --> 35:45.644
What an idiot!

35:56.554 --> 35:57.555
Damn it!

36:30.655 --> 36:31.556
Excuse me!

37:10.895 --> 37:12.230
Now what?

37:41.626 --> 37:42.627
Hey!

37:47.432 --> 37:48.466
Are you okay?

37:51.970 --> 37:54.005
Hey, are you okay?

38:12.824 --> 38:15.693
Is there a doctor or a paramedic?

38:17.428 --> 38:20.398
Someone call an ambulance!

38:22.433 --> 38:26.504
Major roads are swarming with citizens.

38:27.072 --> 38:31.810
Experts say that the creatures
are not of this Earth

38:31.876 --> 38:34.379
but of alien origin.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.714
You're gonna save more people?

38:40.552 --> 38:41.519
Yeah.

38:43.354 --> 38:47.592
Why are you acting like such a hero?

38:49.027 --> 38:50.428
Leave it alone.

38:51.062 --> 38:56.601
I'm just curious about your upbringing.

38:58.703 --> 39:01.539
What do your parents do?

39:03.041 --> 39:04.075
My parents?

39:06.077 --> 39:07.979
Dad was a firefighter.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.549
He died with Mom in a car accident.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.986
When I was in junior high.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.624
Any siblings?

39:20.625 --> 39:22.360
A brother, 10.

39:22.727 --> 39:25.063
Is he in an orphanage?

39:26.030 --> 39:29.500
I work so we can live in an apartment.

39:30.969 --> 39:35.440
If you don't survive,
your brother would be left alone.

39:36.841 --> 39:37.809
Right.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.979
I live with my 3-year-old son.

39:42.747 --> 39:44.515
You're a mom?

39:45.717 --> 39:48.019
Yeah. Do I look too young?

39:51.022 --> 39:55.560
Hey! Just say "yes"
whenever you're asked that.

40:01.166 --> 40:04.802
Anyway, we're both in a similar situation.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.573
We can't afford to die.

40:09.140 --> 40:10.174
Never.

40:12.877 --> 40:13.912
Right.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.814
We can't die.

40:20.785 --> 40:24.722
Military personnel have been deployed

40:24.923 --> 40:27.525
all across the city.

40:29.160 --> 40:33.131
We have an update on the mysterious people
in black suits.

40:34.132 --> 40:37.702
This footage was just uploaded
to a video site.

40:38.736 --> 40:44.042
A young man in black fought
to protect an old couple and a child.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.449
THEY EXIST!

40:51.516 --> 40:53.685
-I'M IMPRESSED.
-GO, OSAKA!

40:53.751 --> 40:56.087
-SEE THE NEWS?
-IS IT REAL?

40:56.154 --> 40:58.856
-THE TV SAYS SO.
-GO, BLACK SUIT!

41:06.564 --> 41:07.698
Go now!

41:07.765 --> 41:08.967
Thank you.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.913
-Use the big gun!
-Not yet!

41:21.979 --> 41:23.648
I'll do it.

41:24.682 --> 41:27.852
There's something crazy about them...

41:32.523 --> 41:34.792
Guys like them always survive.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.829
That dark-skinned one...

41:38.096 --> 41:39.998
We call him George.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.967
His real name is Shimaki.

41:43.868 --> 41:45.236
He's won three bonuses.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.841
The tall skinhead is Nobuo Muroya.

41:50.641 --> 41:52.543
We call him Nobuyan.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.779
He's won four times.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.849
He's a megalomaniac.

41:58.249 --> 41:59.550
And he's a reckless...

42:00.985 --> 42:02.587
self-appointed leader.

42:03.287 --> 42:04.155
But...

42:05.290 --> 42:06.991
there's one more.

42:08.226 --> 42:09.594
Really?

42:10.928 --> 42:14.565
Hachiro Oka, a seven-time bonus winner.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.702
He's somewhere.

42:19.570 --> 42:21.739
He cloaks himself and goes into hiding.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.620
Good...

42:48.966 --> 42:51.202
I hope Kato is doing okay.

42:55.606 --> 42:56.641
What's wrong?

42:58.976 --> 43:00.711
If Kurono was alive,

43:01.212 --> 43:05.049
would he have saved people like Kato?

43:06.150 --> 43:09.620
I'm sure he would have.

43:11.055 --> 43:14.892
We can resurrect Kurono if we score 100.

43:16.060 --> 43:19.063
We don't have a chance.

43:20.198 --> 43:21.833
But, Suzuki...

43:21.899 --> 43:25.870
We can hardly take care of ourselves.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.175
Oh, no!

44:25.229 --> 44:27.665
There's one in Japan?

44:31.869 --> 44:34.038
Is it on our side?

44:59.931 --> 45:02.867
The Boss creature should be 100 points.

45:03.401 --> 45:06.437
One hundred points for one creature?

45:06.837 --> 45:08.806
Yeah, 100 for one.

45:09.207 --> 45:13.978
The monsters on the tower look badass.

45:14.879 --> 45:17.915
Killing one won't get 100 points.

45:17.982 --> 45:21.419
Oka says it's happened before.

45:21.485 --> 45:22.753
Really?

45:23.721 --> 45:27.725
It was before our time.
Before we went to the room.

45:28.793 --> 45:31.128
Everyone died except Oka.

45:31.863 --> 45:34.031
Oka killed the Boss monster.

45:34.432 --> 45:35.733
By himself!

45:36.901 --> 45:38.803
He's a monster himself!

45:56.754 --> 45:57.488
Oh, God.

45:58.756 --> 45:59.857
What's that?

46:00.858 --> 46:04.095
It's way out of our league.

46:04.161 --> 46:06.397
Freeze! Put your hands up!

46:08.532 --> 46:09.800
Wait!

46:11.402 --> 46:12.270
Don't shoot!

46:15.840 --> 46:16.974
Kato!

46:17.375 --> 46:18.309
Don't shoot!

46:19.076 --> 46:22.213
You in the black suits! Who are you with?

46:22.513 --> 46:24.115
-I'll shoot!
-Wait!

46:25.016 --> 46:28.853
-We're agents.
-State your unit.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.421
Our unit is...

46:31.155 --> 46:32.156
Gantz.

46:33.858 --> 46:34.992
Gantz?

46:38.295 --> 46:40.431
He's in even more trouble!

46:40.931 --> 46:42.967
-Show your ID!
-We don't have any.

46:43.267 --> 46:44.535
But it's true!

46:44.802 --> 46:46.070
-I'll shoot!
-No!

46:46.537 --> 46:47.572
Wait a minute.

47:08.893 --> 47:10.127
Fire!

47:14.265 --> 47:16.167
Run, all of you!

47:33.017 --> 47:34.118
Watch Suzuki!

47:58.075 --> 47:59.276
Come and get me!

48:41.585 --> 48:42.620
No way.

49:03.507 --> 49:04.575
Well?

49:07.211 --> 49:08.212
Hey.

49:09.079 --> 49:11.215
You're shitting me.

49:17.421 --> 49:19.056
It's not dead.

49:20.157 --> 49:21.559
Is it a 100?

49:22.459 --> 49:23.728
I'll do him.

49:28.198 --> 49:31.669
You'll be flatter than paper
when I'm through.

49:45.149 --> 49:48.052
Pretty tough, aren't you?

49:48.118 --> 49:49.420
You cockroach.

50:14.278 --> 50:15.713
Stop playing!

50:18.515 --> 50:20.317
You fuck!

50:30.194 --> 50:33.364
You goddamn motherfucker!

50:35.599 --> 50:37.334
Fucking help!

50:37.401 --> 50:41.605
Boo-hoo, can't you take care of yourself?

50:58.823 --> 51:02.760
I bet you shit your pants, Muroya.

51:14.204 --> 51:15.673
Fuck...

51:18.409 --> 51:19.543
He's dead.

51:20.778 --> 51:21.745
No way!

51:37.194 --> 51:38.829
So, you're their boss?

51:39.697 --> 51:41.398
That old man?

51:50.107 --> 51:51.809
Gotcha!

52:10.427 --> 52:11.595
What the...?

52:13.230 --> 52:15.365
What is this?

52:16.433 --> 52:18.335
What is it?

53:02.880 --> 53:05.215
I've caught you!

53:28.405 --> 53:30.607
This can't be true!

53:31.475 --> 53:32.876
They're both dead!

53:37.481 --> 53:38.682
What's your plan?

53:40.818 --> 53:43.554
I'll do whatever I can.

53:43.954 --> 53:45.589
You'll die!

53:45.856 --> 53:47.891
Think of your brother!

53:47.958 --> 53:50.594
That's why it has to be done.

53:51.995 --> 53:53.630
Otherwise...

53:54.498 --> 53:55.933
we'll all die.

53:58.836 --> 54:00.470
But how?

54:01.238 --> 54:04.775
Hey! Hey! Don't be stupid!

54:41.645 --> 54:42.813
She just dodges it!

54:53.524 --> 54:54.925
She's too quick.

54:56.693 --> 54:57.861
All together!

55:22.619 --> 55:23.654
She was hit.

55:36.366 --> 55:38.702
A hit to the head has no effect!

55:42.906 --> 55:43.974
Cover me.

55:49.646 --> 55:52.716
Ayumu, I promise you.

55:54.051 --> 55:55.853
I'll come home!

56:47.671 --> 56:49.439
I got the Boss!

57:02.552 --> 57:05.689
You almost blew us all up!

57:06.056 --> 57:10.527
Big deal! I went for his arm anyway.

57:15.132 --> 57:16.667
We made it...

57:18.101 --> 57:20.437
We beat the Osaka team.

57:40.924 --> 57:41.992
No...

57:43.060 --> 57:44.995
What the heck?

57:49.499 --> 57:50.634
Oh, God!

58:11.688 --> 58:12.689
Run.

58:18.161 --> 58:19.162
Run!

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.247
We lost...

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.115
Look at its head.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:31.161
-It's Oka.
-Oka?

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:33.163
Hachiro Oka!

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:48.912
He got it!

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.028
Still bleeding.

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:08.865
Hey, can you hear me?

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.737
Kato, look at that!

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:18.208
It's alive.

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:19.910
Shit!

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:25.682
Oka...

01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:32.222
So, if you live to the end of the game,
you'll recover?

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:34.257
Well, yes...

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:37.861
If Oka beats him quickly,

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.397
it will help.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.078
It's too powerful!

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:58.415
I don't even know how it attacked me.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.185
Oka can do it.

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.921
He'll beat it!

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:07.457
He's won seven times.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.359
Hachiro Oka.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:33.416
You're deluded
if you think you can beat me, sucker!

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:46.530
What you don't know is,
I played Ping-Pong in college!

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:57.073
I also took karate lessons...

01:02:57.974 --> 01:02:59.943
by correspondence!

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.267
Amazing.

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:27.103
Did he win...?

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.073
You want to die?

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:35.045
It's not over. Can't you see?

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:47.357
I find this fascinating.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:50.527
Very fascinating.

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.606
I think I got it.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:17.287
I've got it. Here I go!

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.911
He'll lose...

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.881
Come on, boy!

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:04.968
Oka, no!

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:30.193
Eat this!

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:50.013
Only intuitive attacks work on him.

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:00.723
Is it over? Did he die?

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:02.625
Not yet.

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:05.361
-No?
-What do you mean?

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:09.165
Only surprise attacks work. I'll go cloak.

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:12.135
You should finish him off now!

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.738
No, it's risky.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.311
Damn it...

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:29.719
It is risky.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.155
I know.

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.190
But...

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:37.160
someone's got to do it.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:40.563
Kato!

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:13.530
Kato!

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.540
Suzuki! Why did you...?

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:26.609
Your brother...

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.246
He's waiting for you.

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:35.818
Suzuki! Suzuki!

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.181
Reika.

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:08.218
Watch Suzuki.

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:10.486
But it's...

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:12.155
too late.

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:15.625
We can save him.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.166
What about you?

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:24.834
I'll do it.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:28.738
I'll finish the game.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.642
-Kato!
-Don't!

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:41.850
Where's that other guy?

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:44.621
He was fun to play with.

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:18.220
Stay here. I'll kill you later.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:25.795
Hey, are you okay?

01:09:27.764 --> 01:09:32.868
-What now?
-We can run and leave it to Oka!

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:34.804
And if he loses?

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:36.506
But...

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:39.742
We have to think of a way to win!

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:41.844
It's impossible.

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:46.448
We can't die.
We both have someone waiting for us.

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:52.622
That's why I'm going.

01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:56.359
I have to!

01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:00.863
I have to! Who else will?

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:04.567
You're right.

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:07.336
We have to.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:09.238
Reika.

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:11.774
How can we beat that thing?

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:16.913
Oka said it must be a surprise attack.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.649
How do we surprise him?

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:21.951
Maybe we can snipe him.

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:27.557
Good idea.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:32.929
I'll be a decoy. When he approaches,
shoot him from a distance.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.665
Are you out of your mind?!

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:41.871
We have no choice.

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:49.278
Are you sure we want to snipe him?

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:24.547
Ayumu.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:31.988
What's wrong?

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:36.359
Listen.

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:40.396
I have to say this before I go.

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:43.699
You...

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:48.471
You mean a lot to me.

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:55.078
Please don't die.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:59.382
Do not die, okay?

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.553
I don't intend to.

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:08.625
You mean it?

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.494
You really mean it?

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:13.596
Yes.

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:19.635
I won't give up,
even if the odds are against me.

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:26.842
Promise me.

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:31.547
If you survive,
the four of us can live together.

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:35.885
You, your brother, me, and my boy.

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:41.023
All right? Make a promise.

01:12:46.962 --> 01:12:48.097
Come on!

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:53.369
Just say "yes" when you're asked that.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:12:59.909
Yes.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:03.879
It's a promise.

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:07.983
Don't break it!

01:13:14.023 --> 01:13:15.124
I'll protect you.

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:17.960
I won't let you die!

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:22.965
Watch me get a bull's-eye on that thing!

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:34.510
I will make it home.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.115
For sure.

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.124
What the...?

01:14:23.726 --> 01:14:26.496
They're not in position yet...

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:40.643
Wait.

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:45.481
Let me ask you.

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:49.519
Why are we...

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.221
killing each other?

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:58.728
Do you feel that you're in God's presence?

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:00.563
God?

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:05.868
God is the absolute power.

01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:10.005
You're God...

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:12.808
are you?

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:18.547
This world has many.
I'm merely one of them.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:23.152
There is no defying that fact.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.527
I hit him!

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:42.638
We'll live together!

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:45.208
I'll end this!

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:47.810
Die!

01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:57.086
I got it.

01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:58.921
I see.

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:04.227
I can finish him off!

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:13.569
He's just shooting blind.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:09.292
Kato!

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:55.798
I got the Big Boss.

01:20:58.153 --> 01:20:59.321
It's over.

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.225
It's really over.

01:22:37.186 --> 01:22:38.320
But I...

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.257
I was of no help.

01:22:43.225 --> 01:22:44.459
Me neither.

01:22:45.227 --> 01:22:47.129
Kato did everything.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.399
Where is he?

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:52.501
Oh, no!

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:55.537
I guess he's dead.

01:22:57.506 --> 01:22:59.074
No...

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:01.510
He did so much...

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:03.378
Gantz.

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:06.114
Score me.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.491
Live from Osaka.

01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:20.329
With no explosions,
the Dotonbori area is very quiet.

01:23:20.396 --> 01:23:21.430
EAT BY YOURSELF.

01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:25.467
There's no sign of the creatures.

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:30.339
Soldiers are assessing the situation.

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:35.511
We only returned because of Kato...

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:04.139
Kato!

01:24:06.675 --> 01:24:08.043
I...

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:10.512
You survived.

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.247
Oh, God!

01:24:13.115 --> 01:24:14.750
I'm so happy.

01:24:16.185 --> 01:24:17.653
You barely made it.

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:29.131
It's time to score your points.

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.143
Jugs, six points.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.448
Baldy, two points.

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:52.254
Nishi, 12 points.

01:24:55.224 --> 01:24:58.193
It's your turn, Kato.

01:25:03.165 --> 01:25:06.334
Kato-cha, LOL, 100 points.

01:25:06.869 --> 01:25:08.637
-Shit!
-Amazing!

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.338
You cleared it!

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:12.574
Did I...?

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:17.546
Bonus menu.

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:21.783
One, weapon.
Two, resurrection. Three, freedom.

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:37.732
2. RESURRECT A DEAD PLAYER.

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.868
3. HAVE YOUR MEMORY WIPED AND QUIT.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.703
Choose three and you're free.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:46.208
And go back to living
with your brother like before.

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:47.910
I'm happy for you.

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:50.913
Kato.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.181
Thank you.

01:25:53.849 --> 01:25:55.217
Goodbye.

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:56.818
Have a nice life.

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:33.488
Hey...?

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:38.960
I didn't die...

01:26:50.472 --> 01:26:51.773
Oh, that fool...

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:56.878
That hypocrite!

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:06.421
KATO-CHA (LOL) 100 POINTS

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:25.340
You think she was resurrected?

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:28.677
But why, Kato?

01:27:29.311 --> 01:27:31.646
What about your brother?

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:35.017
You'll have to join the game again.

01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:37.485
You could die.

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:41.490
But I made her a promise.

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:49.765
That's lame.

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:56.972
I can leave?

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:05.614
My brother's waiting at home!

01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:22.831
You didn't tell Kato

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:26.668
that he used to fight with us.

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:28.637
Your brother's waiting.

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:32.073
Choose three.

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:36.578
Kei...

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:48.390
If I had, he'd fight to resurrect
everyone who'd ever died in the game.

01:28:49.591 --> 01:28:50.826
You're right.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:29:00.335
I choose three. Free me.

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:11.613
I never thought he'd be back!

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:16.017
He hasn't changed a bit.

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:21.656
Every time it's the same for him.

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:25.960
He risks his life for others.

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:30.799
Kurono was like that, too.

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:37.105
I'll do the same.

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:41.376
One day...

01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:44.646
I'll get Kurono back.

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:01.429
I'm home!

01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:22.050
