# I could be loud man I could be silent

00:17.120 --> 00:20.240
# I could be young man or I could be old

# I could be a gentleman I could be violent

00:23.520 --> 00:26.560
# I could turn hot man or I could be cold

00:26.560 --> 00:29.640
# I could be just like the calm before the storm, boy

00:29.640 --> 00:32.680
# Waiting for all hell yeah to break loose

00:32.680 --> 00:35.840

CAR APPROACHES

02:13.480 --> 02:16.160
Marcus! Marcus!

02:16.160 --> 02:18.240
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.800
SHE TYPES

03:40.960 --> 03:44.560
Hey, Jess, it's me. I'm just checking to see if you're coming.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.560
Don't make me do this on my own, OK?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.680
You've got 20 minutes to get dressed.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.600
- Up and at 'em. 
- PHONE BEEPS

04:11.560 --> 04:13.120
Are you sure we can't just stay here?

04:17.959 --> 04:20.640
Hmm. It's probably a bit snug, but it'll do.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.600
- Do people dress up? 
- It's kind of a significant occasion.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.480
Probably good to shave too.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.920
I don't think anyone will care if I've shaved or not.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.480
It's giving me pash rash.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.880
Well, that's another thing altogether.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.560
You write something?

04:55.600 --> 04:56.640
I tried.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.240
What can you say about a woman who fell apart when her marriage collapsed

05:01.240 --> 05:02.840
and slowly went mad?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.320
She got great joy from her painting.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.800
CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

05:11.800 --> 05:13.520
What the hell's he doing here?

05:15.040 --> 05:18.720
Mum was born in 1953, here in Canberra.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.160
She always wanted to be a teacher and graduated

05:21.160 --> 05:24.240
from St Catherine's Teaching College with honours.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.400
She fell pregnant with me two months before she was due to start teaching

05:30.400 --> 05:32.440
her first class.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.560
And then Jesse.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.360
And she made a decision to dedicate herself to family life instead.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.880
Sadly...

05:44.880 --> 05:47.920
..the last few years haven't been kind to Mum...

05:56.800 --> 05:59.000
..but she loved us as best she could.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.200
She got great joy from her painting.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.840
She had very beautiful hands, very soft.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.680
She would tuck us in at night.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.080
First Ned and then me cos I was on the bottom bunk.

06:26.080 --> 06:29.360
And she'd kiss me on the cheek and then she'd stroke my eyelids

06:29.360 --> 06:32.320
with her fingertips, as soft as a bird.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.480
She'd crouch there...

06:36.480 --> 06:38.920
in the dark, even though it would hurt her back,

06:38.920 --> 06:41.320
for as long as it took until I was asleep.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.840
"It's what mothers do," she used to say.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.160
Hm.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.320
It made me feel good.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.880
(Who's that?)

07:08.880 --> 07:11.040
(Who's that?)

07:11.040 --> 07:12.120
My dad.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.880
- I'll call you in the next couple of days. 
- That's all right.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.080
- Thank you. 
- You're very welcome.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.600
I'll just introduce you to the boys.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.040
- All right, come on. 
- Where?

07:24.040 --> 07:25.840
Jess.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.560
Oh. Hello, Dad.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.320
Ned.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.000
Hey.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.640
- I'm Hani. 
- Yes.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.560
Dad, this is Hani.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.680
Hani, Dad.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.920
David.

07:45.920 --> 07:50.200
- Hi. 
- Of course, you wouldn't have to call him Dad, obviously.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.360
- And this is Mandy. 
- Hi.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.840
Sorry about your mum.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.400
Oh, there's no need for you to be sorry, is there?

07:57.400 --> 08:00.600
It's not like you did anything to contribute to her demise...

08:01.840 --> 08:02.920
..I assume.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.920
How long have you been dad's girlfriend?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.040
Not that long. Three months.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.240
Three months? Oh, she's a keeper then.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.560
We've got to go.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.560
Where do we have to go?

08:16.560 --> 08:18.200
You're kidding me.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.240
Unbelievable.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.760
I don't know what you think you're doing, but...

08:26.760 --> 08:28.280
we're trying to bury my mother here.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.880
- Burn. 
- Eh?

08:31.160 --> 08:32.720
We're cremating her, not...

08:32.720 --> 08:34.600
So you can take your little surveillance kit

08:34.600 --> 08:36.919
and go and spy on someone else today.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.919
Ned Banks, Nolan Daniels, Federal Police.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.320
Look, I was hoping to wait until things had wrapped up here

08:42.320 --> 08:43.919
but we really can't wait any longer.

08:43.919 --> 08:46.720
Well, unless you're planning to arrest us we're not talking to anyone.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.720
Well, we could go that way - arrest first, talk later - but we'd rather not.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.040
- What's he talking about? 
- I don't know yet. 
- What's going on?

08:52.040 --> 08:53.520
I've got this. I don't need your help.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.080
Listen, I think this is in everyone's best interests if we deal with this at the station.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.760
Uh...no. No. No. No. I can't do that.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.800
I can't possibly go to the police station.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.840
Hey! What you doing?!

09:01.840 --> 09:04.160
- HANI: 
- Hey, hey, hey! How about you just don't touch him, OK?

09:04.160 --> 09:05.640
Listen.

09:05.640 --> 09:09.760
Hey, however we do this, you need to come now.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.600
DOOR OPENS

09:33.600 --> 09:36.280
On a scale of one to ten, how bad are you feeling?

09:40.160 --> 09:41.720
Just, I don't have a paper bag on me,

09:41.720 --> 09:44.600
and if you're going to have a panic attack, I want one.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.480
Quite used to managing them on my own

09:46.480 --> 09:49.040
without a paper bag, as it happens.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.560
Right.

09:50.560 --> 09:54.480
Cos I've got some news that's not going to make you any less stressed.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.840
Section 12 warrants.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.920
Extradition orders from the US Department of Justice.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.240
They want us to surrender you and Jesse

10:06.240 --> 10:08.760
to face charges for the theft and distribution

10:08.760 --> 10:11.240
of the restricted data Jesse stole.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.760
And he didn't do himself any favours

10:12.760 --> 10:14.800
with his hack into the parliamentary network.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.800
So, at the moment, the only thing standing between you two

10:17.800 --> 10:21.960
and the American court system is a signature from the Attorney General.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.640
You outed some powerful people, Jesse.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.840
There's a feeling that an example needs to be made.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.240
You and I both know that if the Americans get you to the States

10:32.240 --> 10:33.400
you're toast.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.960
And yet, if, as you say,

10:35.960 --> 10:38.840
all that stands between us and the American court system is a signature

10:38.840 --> 10:41.040
from the Attorney General,

10:41.040 --> 10:42.960
why haven't they signed?

10:45.880 --> 10:48.320
HE SIGHS

10:49.840 --> 10:52.240
I'm going to be straight up with you, Jesse.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.360
We've got a little problem that we're struggling with

10:54.360 --> 10:58.360
and if you had a crack at helping us fix it,

10:58.360 --> 11:00.040
it would go a long way to making

11:00.040 --> 11:04.120
the Attorney General happier to argue the case for keeping you here.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.680
What kind of problem?

11:10.120 --> 11:13.080
The attack on the Australian surfers in West Papua.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.360
You didn't see it on the news this morning?

11:17.360 --> 11:18.480
I don't do the news.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.840
My focus tends to be smaller than the whole world.

11:23.880 --> 11:24.920
Lucky old you.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.080
Well, there was a third man in the car.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.120
You know him?

11:32.040 --> 11:33.840
Dan Roth.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.760
I've been chasing him for a while.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.040
He's been living off the grid, operating under the radar.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.080
I don't see how this could possibly have anything to do with me.

11:41.080 --> 11:44.360
Roth is the brains behind this website on the darknet.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.920
Darknet(!)

11:45.920 --> 11:48.240
It's neither especially deep nor dark.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.280
It's just not accessible without the right tools.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.320
Not dark, eh?

11:53.760 --> 11:55.480
Let's see what he's got for sale.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.800
And then there was this.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.840
A couple of months ago, this young boy

12:16.840 --> 12:20.040
becomes friends with a girl online...

12:20.040 --> 12:22.800
and they text message each other for a few weeks.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.920
And then she suggests that they meet up.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.320
I don't... I don't want to see that.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.760
He hasn't been seen since.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.480
Please, I can't have that kind of story in my head

12:47.480 --> 12:49.800
cos once it's in there I won't be able to get it out.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.720
Callum's parents, they don't want to have this story in their heads either, Jesse.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.440
Callum was hassling us to stay at a friend's place for the weekend.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.440
I wasn't keen.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.400
His grades have been shocking lately.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.800
Sometimes you just run out of steam.

13:08.800 --> 13:13.600
You say yes to avoid the moods and slamming doors.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.640
You are turning into a royal pain in the arse, mate.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.800
You know whose fault that is? Mine.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.240
You can get yourself to Ben's place.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.120
I'm tired of playing chauffeur.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.680
He has asthma and he didn't take a Ventolin.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.080
We were going to drop one over,

13:32.080 --> 13:35.080
- Michael called.... 
- He wasn't there. 
- SHE SIGHS

13:35.080 --> 13:37.880
There wasn't any plan for him to stay the weekend.

13:40.800 --> 13:46.640
Mr and Mrs McCray, we believe that the person posing as Rachel...

13:46.640 --> 13:49.200
has connections to known sex offenders.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.680
There is a hidden side on the internet.

13:54.680 --> 13:58.080
It's used as a marketplace for videos...

13:59.560 --> 14:01.040
..images.

14:01.040 --> 14:05.400
Last week a user posted a more serious proposition for sale.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.600
There were images of Callum

14:08.600 --> 14:12.520
- and an offer to spend time with him for a fee of 15,000. 
- No.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.000
MRS MCCRAY SOBS

14:20.560 --> 14:22.680
The McCrays don't have a choice...

14:24.120 --> 14:25.520
..but you do.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.360
You can choose to help us find their son.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.920
You're the brother that's always getting you into trouble, right?

14:33.920 --> 14:35.720
Ned's the one that bails you out.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.120
Surely you must be sick of that.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.680
Yo!

15:13.160 --> 15:16.160
- Where's Rachel? 
- She's still with her step-mum.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.920
They broke down on the way back, but she's going to get the train.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.480
She'll be here first thing in the morning.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.120
Just, you know, relax, man.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.960
Eat some pizza.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.440
Play some games.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.800
She'll be here before you know it.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.800
I might go down to the car and have another look for my phone.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.600
No, I looked, man.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.080
It's not there. I can ring it if you're worried.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.720
- No, it's sweet. 
- Sweet.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.040
Eat up, huh?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.640
PHONE RINGS

15:46.640 --> 15:48.080
I've got to take this.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.000
Uh-huh.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.280
Just tell me you didn't agree to anything.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.800
I just need to try and get Roth's attention.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.000
I help them do this

16:06.000 --> 16:09.080
and they make the trouble with the Americans go away.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.480
I can get us out of it, Ned.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.400
Might even be able to save the boy.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.240
I know you don't think I'm capable of it...

16:23.240 --> 16:24.360
but I can.

16:25.720 --> 16:26.840
I can do this.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.360
He does this and the extradition requests go away.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.880
- I want that in writing. 
- I'm not sure you do.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.760
It'd tie you to a result.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.920
If Jesse doesn't make any progress you're back where you started.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.240
Look, this way his agreement to help gives me grounds for

16:47.240 --> 16:50.400
a positive recommendation to the Attorney General.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.760
Lara, come in.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.360
This is Lara Dixon. Her company handles the tech requirements

16:54.360 --> 16:55.600
on some of our cases.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.840
Don't make it sound so glamorous, Nolan.

16:57.840 --> 17:01.000
Well, I was hoping to meet you without these guys dangling an extradition order

17:01.000 --> 17:03.080
over your heads, but I'm not going to be picky.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.040
- Hello. 
- Shall we go?

17:05.040 --> 17:07.160
I'll have someone drop him home as soon as we're done.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.720
Wait, where are you going?

17:08.720 --> 17:10.599
My offices are off-site.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.000
Well, he can't go on his own.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.240
He won't be on his own.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.520
- No, I need to be with him. 
- It's not possible, I'm afraid.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.359
You haven't been security cleared to come into the operations complex.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.359
- Well, you need to organise for me to be cleared. 
- As I said, it's not possible.

17:22.359 --> 17:26.160
My number's there. Call any time to see how he's going.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.840
- There's no address on this. 
- As I said, call any time.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.240
Right, so it's official.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.480
We sub-contract our intelligence out to the private sector now.

17:40.480 --> 17:44.400
I guess they're not bound by the same pesky rules their Government friends are.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.040
You know, I'm surprised they've not been knocking on Jesse's door

17:47.040 --> 17:49.600
every day since the Parliament House hack anyway.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.120
Or yours, for that matter.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.400
So, what you know about UndaCounta this site?

17:58.400 --> 18:01.240
It's like eBay but for the underworld.

18:01.240 --> 18:04.480
Some of its wares are incredibly dark, some are incredibly benign.

18:04.480 --> 18:08.280
So anything from Afghani heroin to fluffy toys,

18:08.280 --> 18:10.160
banned books, dangerous ideas.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.120
Something doesn't sit right.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.560
Why would the Americans trade in their righteous indignation

18:18.560 --> 18:22.320
over what Jesse did to bust an Australian site pedalling kids?

18:22.320 --> 18:24.800
Unless Callum was being pedalled to someone

18:24.800 --> 18:27.880
with a reputation to protect, someone important.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.560
How was he coping?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.480
Like he scored a gig on the A-Team.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.640
I just don't think he gets what happens if they toss us to the wolves.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.360
Afternoon all.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.240
(That's Jesse Banks.)

19:12.240 --> 19:15.440
So...let's see if these rumours are true.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.160
(That's Jesse Banks.)

19:17.160 --> 19:20.800
I'm assuming from your file you know how to drive all this stuff.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.080
Can I see it?

19:25.080 --> 19:30.280
My file. I'm curious to see how much I managed to keep off the radar.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.320
Of course you are.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.520
Not a bad trophy list.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.160
Hmm, not bad.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.560
Not a complete list either.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.280
Don't tell me or I'll have to chase you.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.560
But for the moment let's move you out of the suspects pile...

19:57.600 --> 19:59.320
..and into the white corner.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.840
And let's see what you can do about finding this black hat.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.120
Jan Roth.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.960
If I had to Tweet it,

20:10.960 --> 20:15.600
"Brilliant, ageing, wildly vain egomaniac

20:15.600 --> 20:18.000
"hiding out in a drug-fuelled God complex

20:18.000 --> 20:20.040
"having cast himself as captain of the darknet

20:20.040 --> 20:22.360
"to prove to the world he still matters."

20:22.360 --> 20:24.200
You exceeded your character limit.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.080
Well, I didn't count the commas.

20:31.760 --> 20:36.480
Born here, but lured overseas right after uni for a six-figure job in Silicon Valley.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.400
It all went pear-shaped a few years ago and he disappeared underground.

20:39.400 --> 20:43.120
But, as it happens, he was not enjoying an early retirement.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.040
He set up UndaCounta.com.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.560
A turnover of close to a 1 million in revenue a month

20:49.560 --> 20:52.040
with a 6% commission to its owner. You do the maths.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.720
Up until yesterday we couldn't pin this site to Roth,

20:54.720 --> 20:57.000
but the unsecured call we intercepted after the attack

20:57.000 --> 20:59.400
gave us proof he's the owner.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.520
I need you to hack into UndaCounta.com

21:01.520 --> 21:04.000
and locate the user who wants Callum.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.280
Next time it'll be loaded.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.720
Will it?

21:37.720 --> 21:40.400
Ah! You're in such big trouble.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.480
Come on.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.560
HE GRUNTS

21:53.400 --> 21:54.800
Come on.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.000
Right.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.760
Out you go. You do it.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.040
Go on.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.800
Are you sure? If they get them to the hospital maybe they're OK.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.680
There is no hospital that can fix what happened to them.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.560
Do you know who it was?

22:28.840 --> 22:31.200
I'll talk to Rams, see what he knows.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.080
- Does she know? 
- No, but she can feel it,

22:38.080 --> 22:40.320
and she'll ask where they are.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.920
She will ask why people are trying to hurt you.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.080
I don't want to raise her alone.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.760
I'm not asking any more, Jan, I'm telling you - fight another way.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.800
Roth left the States on August 12th four years ago.

23:10.360 --> 23:11.960
He was never heard of again?

23:13.160 --> 23:15.760
Not registered on the sex offender's list.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.800
So he's just pedalling the wares, not involved in personal use.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.320
Looks like it.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.640
There's an apprehended violence order.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.120
What?

23:29.120 --> 23:31.800
The applicant's name has been redacted.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.440
What do you think that that means?

23:35.040 --> 23:36.920
I don't know.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.880
But they don't want to be publicly linked to Roth.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.840
PHONE BEEPS

23:46.320 --> 23:47.720
Prick.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.880
Who?

23:51.560 --> 23:52.680
My father.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.680
How long since you last saw him?

23:57.680 --> 23:59.600
Don't know.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.960
Really?

24:00.960 --> 24:03.000
- What, you don't believe me? 
- No.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.000
I reckon you know how long it's been to the exact day.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.920
Oh, you're confusing me with the other brother.

24:11.360 --> 24:12.760
What sort of a dad was he?

24:15.040 --> 24:16.480
He left for work early,

24:16.480 --> 24:17.800
he got home from work late,

24:17.800 --> 24:20.160
he slept in on Sundays till midday,

24:20.160 --> 24:21.920
he took us down the coast for fish and chips,

24:21.920 --> 24:23.880
he wrestled, he did not beat us,

24:23.880 --> 24:25.800
and when things got tough, he ran.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.000
Enough?

24:29.240 --> 24:30.280
Yeah.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.680
- Sorry. 
- It's OK.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.920
- Check this out. 
- What is it?

24:56.040 --> 24:59.160
'Parliament House for the latest on the tragedy in West Papua.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.800
'An attack on the Helmston mine road yesterday,

25:01.800 --> 25:04.160
'a bus bombing in Sumatra last week.'

25:04.160 --> 25:06.520
Are we seeing a pattern of attacks against foreign targets?

25:06.520 --> 25:09.760
As I said, I'm not in a position to confirm any link.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.800
And I'd urge you not to engage in speculation until the police

25:12.800 --> 25:15.520
have had proper time to conduct their investigations.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.160
Minister, your personal experience with this kind of tragedy -

25:18.160 --> 25:19.840
the injury of your daughter in Bali -

25:19.840 --> 25:22.840
you must understand that the families are desperate for more information.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.560
How long will they have to wait?

25:24.560 --> 25:27.880
I do understand, Miss Jennings...

25:27.880 --> 25:33.120
the utter incomprehension when somebody you love is in jeopardy far from home,

25:33.120 --> 25:35.480
but I also understand the consequences

25:35.480 --> 25:37.720
of getting the information wrong.

25:37.720 --> 25:41.280
And that makes me more determined to make sure that we don't deal

25:41.280 --> 25:44.240
in supposition, but in facts, and that's what you've had today,

25:44.240 --> 25:47.360
ladies and gentlemen - the facts, exactly as we know them.

25:47.360 --> 25:50.160
As usual, further updates will be provided as soon as we have them.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.440
Thank you.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.880
- REPORTERS SHOUT QUESTIONS 
- Guys, guys, that's it for now.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.560
Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, please.

25:57.560 --> 26:00.720
We'll have more to say on this shortly. That's it for now.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.080
Christ!

26:08.080 --> 26:10.720
- Never goes away, does it? 
- You handled it well.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.600
I'd rather not handle it at all.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.320
And yet every time she gets a mention,

26:14.320 --> 26:17.960
your numbers go up and your personal stock in the party goes through the roof.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.320
Well, I'm going to have to earn that credit another way,

26:20.320 --> 26:23.840
cos dragging Alyse into these things...

26:23.840 --> 26:25.560
it's got to stop.

26:25.560 --> 26:26.960
No more.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.240
Is there any credible evidence

26:32.240 --> 26:34.440
that links those boys' deaths to the mine?

26:34.440 --> 26:36.760
Well, there's been an increase in ambushes on the road

26:36.760 --> 26:39.040
since we started negotiating to expand the lease.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.360
The timing couldn't be worse.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.160
When does the final draft come through?

26:42.160 --> 26:44.000
It should be on your desk tonight.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.600
And the sooner the deal is signed off, the better.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.600
Don't need that.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.840
HE MUTTERS

30:02.920 --> 30:05.480
Perhaps you could post something for sale,

30:05.480 --> 30:07.080
something that could be backed up,

30:07.080 --> 30:08.640
if he bites.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.480
Thoughts?

30:10.480 --> 30:11.800
Um...

30:13.480 --> 30:17.000
The parliamentary network keys you poached. That was my thought.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.920
But he'd know the keys would have been changed the day after I cracked them.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.560
Of course he would.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.720
You're going to tell him you took the new set last week.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.640
I will furnish you with those keys.

30:25.640 --> 30:29.720
And if he bites, we'll send him the keys with a Trojan going along for the ride,

30:29.720 --> 30:31.880
which will give us a backdoor into his system

30:31.880 --> 30:35.200
and the chance to find the IP address of the man who's trying to buy Callum.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.160
Your perfume, it's...

30:48.600 --> 30:50.720
- It's disturbing my train of thought. 
- Oh.

30:52.680 --> 30:56.880
Why don't I give you some space to...do your thing?

31:32.280 --> 31:34.440
HE CHUCKLES

31:53.760 --> 31:55.560
Ask him what it would take.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.080
We don't need to start with anything too flamboyant.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.560
How about this?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.000
Un-fucking-believable.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.240
What would give me the reassurance that I crave?

33:14.800 --> 33:17.080
HE SCOFFS

33:17.080 --> 33:18.880
He is joking, right?

33:29.680 --> 33:31.560
There is nothing to think about.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.240
I'm just saying, I think we could get special dispensation.

33:36.240 --> 33:39.240
What kind of special dispensation have you got for the guys whose

33:39.240 --> 33:42.640
cover will be blown in order to make Jan Roth feel warm and fuzzy?

33:42.640 --> 33:44.920
You're being very dramatic, Nolan.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.120
And if you calm down enough to think it through,

33:47.120 --> 33:50.000
the choice doesn't have to be random. It could be a targeted weed -

33:50.000 --> 33:52.360
officers who have to be brought in from the field anyway.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.480
You know as well as I do, there's fat to be trimmed.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.000
Well, lucky for some, that's not your call to make.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.960
Neil asked me to keep him abreast of significant developments.

33:59.960 --> 34:01.400
Let's see what he thinks.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.000
How long have you had a direct line up to Neil?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.719
Only the last four, five jobs.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.760
Ends and means.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.760
Hm.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.480
What are you doing?

34:46.480 --> 34:49.080
If I take that, I lose all credibility.

34:49.080 --> 34:51.320
Or you blow the whole thing.

34:51.320 --> 34:54.480
If he's offering 20, he can afford 25.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.600
Ah.

35:29.320 --> 35:32.640
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

35:34.760 --> 35:36.440
Nice to get a nod now and again

35:36.440 --> 35:38.960
from people who actually get what it is that you do.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.240
Almost time.

35:40.240 --> 35:44.320
Ask him if he wants you to send the keys to the UndaCounta site

35:44.320 --> 35:45.760
or a private address.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.080
I hope you won't take offence, but...

36:08.160 --> 36:10.840
What's he talking about, "deliver in person"?

36:14.400 --> 36:16.200
No, you're just not getting it.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.920
The stress will cripple him.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.880
There will be a dozen officers to support him,

36:19.880 --> 36:22.000
and I'll be overseeing the entire operation.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.840
Great! If you're already going to be there, why don't you just grab Roth,

36:24.840 --> 36:27.840
- arrest him? 
- He has no legal obligation to speak.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.200
Every second he opts to use his right to silence,

36:30.200 --> 36:31.880
Callum gets further away.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.880
If we get the Trojan into his laptop, we can take him,

36:34.880 --> 36:36.680
and then it doesn't matter if he talks at all

36:36.680 --> 36:39.640
because we'll have access to his whole network and we can find Callum.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.480
He's just not built for it.

36:41.480 --> 36:44.280
It's one thing you ask him to wrangle a computer interaction.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.880
But you load him up with the responsibility of saving a child,

36:46.880 --> 36:48.320
it's too much!

36:48.320 --> 36:50.480
- I think I can do it. 
- Yes, sure you can.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.520
You can't manage a bank account,

36:52.520 --> 36:54.400
you can't go to the dentist on your own,

36:54.400 --> 36:57.480
but you're all over this. I'm sorry, it's just...

36:57.480 --> 36:58.800
It's not an option.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.520
I can do it, Ned, if someone comes with me.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.280
No, we're not going to far North Queensland

37:03.280 --> 37:07.120
- to play undercover tropical cops. 
- I wasn't asking you.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.520
I want Hani to come.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.080
The McCrays are here. Do you want me to...?

37:13.080 --> 37:16.120
Bring them in, thanks, Rowan.

37:16.120 --> 37:19.760
You can tell Callum's parents we're going to give our best opportunity a miss.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.880
Michael, Courtney.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.000
Thanks for coming in.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.240
I was hoping to have some news for you.

37:33.240 --> 37:34.280
But...

37:37.240 --> 37:38.480
I'm going to do it.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.720
This is Jesse.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.440
He's going to help us find Cal.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.640
Thank you so much.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.560
Just, I don't know... I don't understand,

37:58.560 --> 38:00.480
why do you need to go now?

38:00.480 --> 38:03.600
He's the one who got you into trouble in the first place.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.320
He dug this hole.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.240
Why should you have to help him out of it?

38:07.240 --> 38:08.480
Gee, I don't know, Baba,

38:08.480 --> 38:10.920
cos that's what you do when someone you love is in trouble.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.040
Hani, I understand, you want to help him, but...

38:13.040 --> 38:15.160
He can't do that on his own.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.720
I'm not sure what he can do on his own.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.560
Don't, Dad. Don't you dare.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.600
Don't I dare?

38:24.240 --> 38:26.400
Don't I dare to try to speak the truth

38:26.400 --> 38:28.720
about the future of my daughter?

38:28.720 --> 38:31.800
It is one thing that he doesn't even have a job, but this?

38:31.800 --> 38:35.400
Now he's going to drag you back into trouble with the police again

38:35.400 --> 38:37.360
and I'm not allowed to say no?

38:37.360 --> 38:38.680
I love him, Dad!

38:38.680 --> 38:41.040
That's not going to change. So, you better get used to it.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.560
What, you're going to marry him?

38:42.560 --> 38:44.320
Nasib, not now!

38:44.320 --> 38:46.280
Why not now? Why not now?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.760
She's about to fly off to God knows where!

38:52.640 --> 38:54.160
Really,

38:54.160 --> 38:57.400
what kind of life are you going to have, Hani?

38:57.400 --> 38:59.080
Married to someone like him,

38:59.080 --> 39:02.320
trying to raise a family with someone like him?

39:02.320 --> 39:04.560
I'm sorry.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.680
I'm sorry, but I love you.

39:08.520 --> 39:12.760
And I'm watching you build this relationship on uneven ground

39:12.760 --> 39:15.000
and that is a bad place to build.

39:16.400 --> 39:19.120
First with his brother and now with you.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.400
He will wear you out, Hani.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.160
He will wear you into the ground!

39:25.280 --> 39:26.480
I don't care.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.480
I love him. COUGHING

39:33.920 --> 39:36.040
I knocked but you didn't hear me.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.800
Let's go.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.160
- Hi. 
- Hi.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.960
What are you doing here?

40:21.960 --> 40:24.120
What happened with the police?

40:24.120 --> 40:26.160
Oh, it's a long story.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.160
All right, well, I've got the time.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.400
God!

40:35.560 --> 40:38.200
The house just looks like it's been in a time capsule.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.160
- It looks just the same. 
- Dad.

40:42.520 --> 40:47.520
I... I tried to call you earlier but you didn't pick up.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.240
Oh, yeah. Don't take it personally.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.920
I've stopped answering numbers I don't know.

40:51.920 --> 40:54.960
I was at the nursing home and I got your mum's stuff.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.560
I was going to do that in the morning!

40:56.560 --> 40:59.520
Yeah, I know. Look, they said that. I...

40:59.520 --> 41:01.680
I thought...

41:01.680 --> 41:04.000
you might want to go through it together?

41:05.640 --> 41:08.360
What, is there a significant piece of knitting you wanted to claim?

41:15.520 --> 41:17.840
Sharp tongue, soft heart. Just like her.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.600
I'll be here until the end of the week.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.680
Here, Cal!

42:12.680 --> 42:14.600
Callum!

42:14.600 --> 42:16.040
Yoo! Hey-hey!

42:17.280 --> 42:19.160
Got you some food.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.440
Eat up, sunshine.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.200
There's sweet relish on it.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.840
- All right. 
- See you, man.

42:46.680 --> 42:49.520
Unbelievable. You knew the terms.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.880
Yeah, well, there's a reason it's not cheap, mate.

43:04.520 --> 43:07.600
No, I'm lucky enough to not be a fuckin' sicko like you.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.800
What are you doing with my picture?

43:28.680 --> 43:30.080
Mate, it's not what it looks like.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.920
That's the photo I sent to Rachel.

43:31.920 --> 43:33.560
- Why do you have it? 
- Listen, Cal.

43:37.480 --> 43:39.000
There is no Rachel, is there?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.040
Can I just... Just let me explain, OK?

43:41.040 --> 43:43.920
Cos there... There is a lot of money on the table.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.640
I just thought... Man, these guys are loaded.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.880
It's 15 grand, just for a couple of hours.

43:48.880 --> 43:50.160
Get away from me!

43:50.160 --> 43:52.960
Cal, I was waiting for the right time to talking to you about it, yeah?

43:52.960 --> 43:54.560
See if you'd be OK with it, man.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.280
I wouldn't have forced you to do anything.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.920
- I want to go home. 
- You can't go home.

43:57.920 --> 44:01.760
- I want to go home! 
- You can't go home! Get...

44:01.760 --> 44:03.920
- Calm down, mate! 
- Let me out!

44:03.920 --> 44:05.680
- I'm not letting you out, Cal. 
- Let me out!

44:05.680 --> 44:07.920
Just calm down. Listen.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.400
Listen, listen. I'll cancel the whole thing, OK?

44:10.400 --> 44:13.200
I'm just... I'm going to go out. I'll take you home when I get back.

44:52.600 --> 44:55.080
I sit down and I order a hot chocolate.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.440
I give him...

44:57.760 --> 45:00.440
Erm, I sit down, I order a hot chocolate,

45:00.440 --> 45:03.040
give him my Bitcoin address, hand over the USB.

45:03.040 --> 45:06.360
Sit down, order a hot chocolate,

45:06.360 --> 45:08.400
give my Bitcoin address, hand over USB.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.240
And once Roth puts the USB into his laptop,

45:10.240 --> 45:11.960
the Trojan will be activated.

45:13.080 --> 45:14.120
It'll be fine.

45:15.280 --> 45:18.000
We've still got an hour until the meeting. We can relax.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.240
Relax is not the word that springs to mind right now.

45:21.240 --> 45:24.160
Hey, you can do this.

45:24.160 --> 45:26.080
And in six hours, we're back home.

45:27.120 --> 45:29.400
Back in the cocoon.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.800
- I think you should come with me. 
- No way.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.600
You turn up with someone that Roth's not expecting, he'll run.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.120
PHONE RINGS

45:40.360 --> 45:41.960
Answer it.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.760
- Hello. 
- Small tweak in the plan.

45:44.760 --> 45:46.560
I'm at the marina right now.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.280
I don't have as much time as I thought,

45:48.280 --> 45:50.960
so you can come now or not at all.

45:50.960 --> 45:52.920
OK, I'll be there in five minutes.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.960
Good.

45:55.960 --> 45:59.760
Just one more thing, I'll be bringing my girlfriend with me,

45:59.760 --> 46:01.480
just so you know.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.360
You said he'd freak if I came with someone he wasn't expecting.

46:09.360 --> 46:10.760
Now he's expecting her.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.280
Argh!

46:38.160 --> 46:41.600
We've set it up here, so you can have a look at what's going on.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.440
Take a seat.

46:52.160 --> 46:54.920
Order, USB, Bitcoin address, done.

46:54.920 --> 46:56.800
Squeeze my hand if you're stuck.

46:56.800 --> 46:59.080
(Hot chocolate, please. I'd like a hot chocolate.)

46:59.080 --> 47:01.680
(Hot chocolate, please. I'd like a hot chocolate.)

47:01.680 --> 47:03.680
Hot chocolate, please. I'd like a hot chocolate.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.760
Erm, can I have an espresso, please?

47:20.680 --> 47:23.080
There's, erm...

47:23.080 --> 47:25.320
something I want to say,

47:25.320 --> 47:27.680
probably better raised at another time.

47:27.680 --> 47:30.360
But I don't seem to be able to leave it for later.

47:32.440 --> 47:35.720
The thing that I don't seem to be able to put aside

47:35.720 --> 47:37.160
is what your dad said.

47:37.160 --> 47:40.520
Or rather, what you said in response to what your dad said.

47:40.520 --> 47:43.160
Jesse, you can't take anything that my dad says seriously.

47:43.160 --> 47:44.520
Please, let me finish,

47:44.520 --> 47:48.120
so I might be able to move on to the next track.

47:48.120 --> 47:50.160
Your dad said, erm,

47:50.160 --> 47:54.320
a whole range of things about my prospects.

47:54.320 --> 47:57.280
You know, many of which are quite possibly true.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.800
About the uneven ground between us.

47:59.800 --> 48:02.760
About you becoming...

48:02.760 --> 48:03.960
the new Ned.

48:05.320 --> 48:06.440
And you said...

48:08.200 --> 48:11.000
You said, "I don't care.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.200
"I love him."

48:12.200 --> 48:13.640
Oh, for Christ's sake.

48:13.640 --> 48:16.120
Which is a lovely sentiment.

48:16.120 --> 48:19.160
But that's quite different to,

48:19.160 --> 48:21.800
"That's not true...

48:21.800 --> 48:23.200
- "I love him." 
- Jesse!

48:23.200 --> 48:28.480
The implication being that you agree with his assessment.

48:28.480 --> 48:33.360
But yet love me enough in spite of all that.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.480
God, you know, Jesse, I don't think of every detail sometimes.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.000
I just...

48:47.280 --> 48:49.000
Oh, what the hell's he doing?

48:49.000 --> 48:50.160
Hani, get him on track.

48:51.600 --> 48:53.480
It's OK. I'm going to talk to him.

49:14.280 --> 49:15.800
USB, sit down...

49:18.640 --> 49:22.560
You know how sometimes you're crap at expressing your own emotions?

49:24.120 --> 49:25.480
Well, me too.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.320
Lara, we've got an audio problem.

49:35.320 --> 49:36.760
See if we can find them.

49:52.360 --> 49:55.040
Now, as thrilling as your little romantic interlude was,

49:55.040 --> 49:56.800
you brought someone else,

49:56.800 --> 49:59.440
which puts us all in a bit of a predicament, really,

49:59.440 --> 50:02.000
doesn't it? You bring the USB?

50:06.280 --> 50:09.400
Oh, there are so many things I could do with this.

50:09.400 --> 50:11.080
No!

50:11.080 --> 50:13.280
But I'm more interested in you, Jesse.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.960
Your insight into a particular technical problem that I have.

50:15.960 --> 50:18.120
- What kind of problem? 
- Didn't bring with me.

50:18.120 --> 50:19.360
This was a meet and greet.

50:19.360 --> 50:22.240
But if you come out to the boat with me and you crack it,

50:22.240 --> 50:24.760
that 25,000 Bitcoin is still yours.

50:24.760 --> 50:28.560
And the dickheads outside will be none the wiser.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.840
I'm not good with boats.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.200
- Or the water in general. 
- Dead calm.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.960
It's like dancing on ice.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.680
There. Bring that up.

50:50.680 --> 50:53.000
Nolan, they're on the pier.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.800
heading towards a reef runner.

51:03.160 --> 51:06.560
They're boarding the boat now! They're boarding the boat now!

51:06.560 --> 51:08.400
All right, go, go, go, go, go!

52:13.800 --> 52:17.080
Hey, guys, that push-bike out front, that kid who was riding it,

52:17.080 --> 52:18.640
- you seen him? 
- Yeah, he's inside.

52:18.640 --> 52:20.160
He's just crashed out over there.

52:20.160 --> 52:22.760
I'm just trying to get a hold of the police.

52:22.760 --> 52:25.240
Oh, no need, mate. He's my nephew.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.000
I'm looking after him for the weekend.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.920
I don't think you're doing a very good job, man.

52:28.920 --> 52:31.640
He was so off his face when he stumbled in here, he could hardly speak.

52:31.640 --> 52:34.440
Yeah, I know, I know. Video games and vodka.

52:34.440 --> 52:36.840
I came home and found him like that, then he took off.

52:36.840 --> 52:37.880
Mm.

52:40.760 --> 52:43.280
Hey, listen, mate, his parents are away on their anniversary.

52:43.280 --> 52:47.720
They get a call from the cops, I'm never going to hear the end of it. Just let me take him home.

52:47.720 --> 52:49.000
I'll chuck him in a cold shower

52:49.000 --> 52:51.600
and I'll kick his arse when he sobers up, yeah?

52:59.160 --> 53:01.600
Maybe when you've finished with him you can come to my place.

53:01.600 --> 53:04.040
I've got two at home just like him.

53:04.040 --> 53:06.160
No worries, mate. It's my first time.

53:28.360 --> 53:30.120
PHONE RINGS

53:32.400 --> 53:34.280
What's up, Rems?

53:34.280 --> 53:37.320
I'm with Meg. We're at the attack site.

53:37.320 --> 53:39.760
They've taken Eric and Crystal,

53:39.760 --> 53:42.080
but there's another body.

53:42.080 --> 53:44.800
The militia are taking photos.

53:44.800 --> 53:46.080
What the fuck?

53:55.240 --> 53:57.120
I need a better shot.

53:57.120 --> 53:59.320
There's no point if I can't see who it is.

53:59.320 --> 54:01.480
You're not going to see much if you're dead.

54:09.680 --> 54:12.040
It's Marcus.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.040
Marcus! Give me the phone.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.200
Give me the phone.

54:21.120 --> 54:25.120
This is bullshit. He lent me the motorbike so I could get back to the compound.

54:25.120 --> 54:27.240
They killed him and they dumped his body back there

54:27.240 --> 54:28.760
so we could take the blame.

54:30.120 --> 54:32.000
Yeah, OK.

54:33.920 --> 54:36.320
- Drop the jetty buoy. 
- Erm, I don't know...

54:36.320 --> 54:39.520
The buoy on the jetty, fuckin' drop it!

54:43.320 --> 54:45.360
ENGINE REVS

54:45.360 --> 54:46.720
Where are we going?

55:16.480 --> 55:17.920
Just in from Intelligence,

55:17.920 --> 55:20.680
they've got the guy responsible for the attack.
