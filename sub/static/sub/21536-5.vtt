WEBVTT

00:03.303 --> 00:05.605
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION</i>
<i>DOLLAR LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:05.638 --> 00:06.606
- SO I'M YOUR BROKER.
- YES,

00:06.639 --> 00:07.741
- YOU PROMISE.
- YES.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.409
- ZACH VELLA
IS A GREAT, GREAT DEVELOPER.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.111
- THE BEST
PENTHOUSE DOWNTOWN,

00:11.144 --> 00:14.214
$16,750,000.

00:15.482 --> 00:16.616
[hand slap]
- WHEE!

00:16.649 --> 00:18.051
WE HAVE A DEAL,
EVERYBODY.

00:24.224 --> 00:25.592
- OH, THAT NEW BUILDING,
THE GLASS ONE

00:25.625 --> 00:26.760
WITH THE LIMESTONE TRIM.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.194
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GETTING THIS CALL.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.596
- HAVE YOU SOLD ANY YET?

00:29.629 --> 00:31.598
I'LL SELL SOME FOR YOU.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.603
- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME
TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THIS IS,

00:36.636 --> 00:38.505
'CAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE,
AND I WAS WALKING UP THE STAIRS,

00:38.538 --> 00:40.674
AND I FELT LIKE I WAS IN<i>ALICE</i>
<i>IN WONDERLAND,</i>OR SOMETHING.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.775
- REALLY?

00:41.808 --> 00:43.309
- IT'S TAKING EVERYTHING
INSIDE OF ME

00:43.343 --> 00:46.479
NOT TO PUNCH THIS GUY
IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW.

00:50.050 --> 00:56.189
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION,
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.724
- I COME FROM
A REAL ESTATE FAMILY,

00:57.757 --> 01:00.393
BUT I GUESS YOU CAN CALL ME
THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.063
- I'M THE CLOSER,
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.532
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.833
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN,
LOOK ME--

01:06.866 --> 01:08.301
- YES,
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.787
[cell phone rings]

01:30.423 --> 01:36.296
- LIPS TO EYES.
LIPS TO EYES.

01:36.329 --> 01:41.468
I USED TO ACT ON A SOAP OPERA,
AND I TOOK SOME MOVES

01:41.501 --> 01:43.603
THAT I LEARNED
FROM DAYTIME TELEVISION,

01:43.636 --> 01:46.673
REGARDING
INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION,

01:46.706 --> 01:48.108
AND SOMETIMES
I LIKE TO BRUSH UP.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.443
[whispering] LIPS TO EYES.
[cell phone rings]

01:50.477 --> 01:51.845
JEEZ, LEAVE ME ALONE.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.115
DIMPLE.

01:55.148 --> 01:59.652
DIMPLE. GOOD. OKAY.
[pounding at the door]

01:59.686 --> 02:01.955
- I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.
- JESUS CHRIST.

02:02.055 --> 02:05.759
[knocking]

02:05.792 --> 02:07.394
- RYAN!

02:07.427 --> 02:08.695
- HEY.
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

02:08.728 --> 02:09.863
- I HAD NO IDEA.
- YOU'RE RUINING THE WHOLE DAY,

02:09.896 --> 02:11.931
I HAVE A LIFE, I HAVE TO--
- SHH! [whispers]

02:11.965 --> 02:13.667
- I, LIKE, HAVE TO WAIT
25 MINUTES FOR THE GUY,

02:13.700 --> 02:16.436
HE WON'T LET ME IN.
- YOU CALLED ME LIKE TEN TIMES.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.538
- RYAN, I WAS DOWNSTAIRS,
WAITING FOR YOU,

02:18.571 --> 02:19.873
TRYING TO GIVE YOU
THE COMPS THAT YOU NEEDED.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.708
I TRAVEL ALL THE WAY,
AND ALL THEY SAY IS,

02:21.741 --> 02:24.144
"I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T GO UP
WITHOUT RYAN'S PERMISSION,"

02:24.177 --> 02:27.080
SO I TRIED CALLING YOU.
THEY THINK I'M A STALKER.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.749
- WHAT--
- 'CAUSE YOU COULD BE A STALKER.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.185
I MAKE IT VERY CLEAR
TO THE DOORMAN

02:32.218 --> 02:34.320
IN THIS BUILDING AND EVERY
BUILDING THAT I'VE LIVED IN,

02:34.354 --> 02:37.757
THAT RANDOM GIRLS ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO COME TO MY APARTMENT,

02:37.791 --> 02:41.494
BECAUSE IT CAN BE
VERY DANGEROUS FOR ME.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.863
I [bleep] YOU NOT,
THIS IS A CONVERSATION

02:43.897 --> 02:45.665
THAT I HAVE
WITH THE DOORMAN.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.168
BUT HONESTLY, THE DOORMEN
HAVE TO PROTECT ME AGAINST,

02:48.201 --> 02:49.536
YOU KNOW--
- A STALKER?

02:49.569 --> 02:50.970
- WELL, GIRLS THAT JUST...
- DO I LOOK LIKE A STALKER?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.505
- SHOW UP TO MY APARTMENT
AFTER I SHOW THEM WHERE I LIVE,

02:52.539 --> 02:53.907
AND THEN I GOTTA BE, LIKE,
PROTECTED,

02:53.940 --> 02:56.343
WHAT IF THEY BRING WEAPONS UP?
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU...

02:56.376 --> 02:59.813
HAVE A WEAP--
OH, HOLD ON.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.614
OKAY.
IT'S A LITTLE CROOKED.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.083
OKAY.
- RYAN'S SERHANT.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.584
[slams papers down]
- ALL RIGHT, SO I GOTTA GO.

03:04.617 --> 03:05.785
ARE WE GOIN'?
- I'M GOING.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.721
- DO YOU HAVE MY DRIVER WITH ME?
- NO.

03:07.754 --> 03:11.091
- DINA! DINA, DINA, DINA,
DINA, DINA.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.625
[door shuts]

03:21.901 --> 03:23.570
[cell phone rings]

03:23.603 --> 03:25.271
- FREDRIK SPEAKING.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.140
- [on phone] HEY, FRED.
IT'S ZACH.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.209
- HI, ZACH. HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW ARE YOU?

03:29.242 --> 03:30.243
- I'M GOOD.
- GOOD.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.281
- YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?

03:37.817 --> 03:39.285
- SO I GET A CALL FROM ZACH,
AND I'M THINKING HE'S GONNA

03:39.319 --> 03:40.653
WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE DEAL WE JUST DID

03:40.687 --> 03:42.322
AT 471 WASHINGTON.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.857
- GOOD JOB.
- THANK YOU.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.761
BUT INSTEAD, HE STARTS
TALKING ABOUT 949 PARK.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.330
ZACH BROUGHT MICHAEL ON TO SELL
THE BUILDING ABOUT A MONTH AGO,

03:50.363 --> 03:54.934
BUT NOTHING HAS SOLD SINCE THEN,
SO...THEY NEED ME.

04:01.675 --> 04:05.045
- YEAH, I THINK THAT'S
REALLY GREAT. UH, WOW.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.681
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS SO EXCITING.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THAT BUILDING

04:07.714 --> 04:09.149
SINCE IT POPPED
OUT OF THE GROUND.

04:09.182 --> 04:12.052
YOU KNOW, I'M A TEAM PLAYER.
I WOULD LOVE TO GET ON THE TEAM,

04:12.052 --> 04:13.520
DO CO-LISTING, AND,
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

04:13.553 --> 04:14.788
SELL IT OUT FOR YOU.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.093
- OKAY, THANK YOU, ZACH.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

04:20.126 --> 04:22.062
WHEE!

04:28.735 --> 04:31.304
- CHELSEA IS LOCATED
ON THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN.

04:31.338 --> 04:36.276
IT'S ONE OF
THE MOST NEWLY-EXPENSIVE AREAS.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.844
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY
THAT CHELSEA IS

04:37.877 --> 04:39.946
ONE OF
THE MELTING POTS OF MANHATTAN.

04:39.979 --> 04:42.682
IT'S GOT YOUNG PROFESSIONALS,
IT'S GOT YOUNG FAMILIES,

04:42.716 --> 04:44.584
IT'S GOT A HEAVY GAY COMMUNITY,
ARTISTS,

04:44.617 --> 04:47.120
IT'S A VERY, VERY, VERY,
ECLECTIC NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.123
[car alarm chirps]

04:52.158 --> 04:53.626
- HEY, RYAN.
- HEY.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.328
- NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW YA DOIN'?
- HEY, TOM, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

04:55.362 --> 04:58.198
- SO THIS IS THE PLACE.
- WOW.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.265
- HELLO.
- THIS IS CHRISTIAN DAMEROW.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.633
- HEY, CHRISTIAN.
- HI, GOOD TO MEET YOU.

05:00.667 --> 05:01.835
- HI, GOOD TO MEET YOU.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.103
- SO I GUESS
WE'LL JUST SHOW YOU AROUND.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.371
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.111
THE ART IN THIS PLACE
IS AMAZING.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.680
I MEAN, IT'S WORTH
AT LEAST A COUPLE MILLION.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.099
SO I TAKE IT
YOU DON'T LIVE HERE FULL-TIME.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.300
- NO.
- WHERE DO YOU

05:34.334 --> 05:35.301
SPEND MOST OF YOU TIME?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.636
- IN MIAMI.
- OKAY.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.905
- THAT'S WHY THIS PLACE IS
LAID OUT THE WAY IT IS.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.507
THAT'S KIND OF--
IT'S MORE OF A PARTY PAD THAN--

05:40.540 --> 05:42.275
- A PARTY PAD.
- YEAH.

05:42.308 --> 05:43.977
- I THINK--
I THINK YOU JUST MADE MY DAY.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.546
- [laughs]

05:46.579 --> 05:48.748
THIS IS THE PART--THE BATHROOM
THAT GETS USED IN PARTIES.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.151
THAT SINK IS ACTUALLY
REINFORCED, SO IT'LL SUPPORT

05:51.184 --> 05:52.519
THE WEIGHT OF TWO PEOPLE.
- [laughs]

05:52.552 --> 05:54.087
- DON'T ASK.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.588
- [laughing]
IT'S BETTER TO BE SAFE.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.990
- [laughs]
- REALLY?

05:57.090 --> 05:58.291
- THAT WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT,
AND I'M NOT LYING.

05:58.324 --> 05:59.359
- YOU'RE NOT LYING?
- NO.

05:59.392 --> 06:00.360
- THE SINK
WAS SPECIALLY REINFORCED

06:00.393 --> 06:01.928
TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT
OF TWO PEOPLE.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.397
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA
EXPLAIN THAT TO PEOPLE, BUT--

06:04.431 --> 06:06.433
- I'M--THAT'S GONNA BE
A CRUCIAL LISTING DETAIL FOR ME.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.501
- YEAH. [laughs] YEAH.
- THIS IS LIKE A CLUB.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.270
THIS IS CLUB 22nd STREET.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.271
- IT HAS DEFINITELY
BEEN THAT WAY.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.339
- COOL.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.544
A ROOF/DECK HOT TUB,
A REINFORCED SINK,

06:17.577 --> 06:19.312
BEDS THAT
COME OUT OF WALLS,

06:19.346 --> 06:21.414
IT'S LIKE THIS APARTMENT
WAS MADE FOR ME TO REPRESENT.

06:21.448 --> 06:24.751
I MEAN, IT'S THE ULTIMATE,
ULTIMATE BACHELOR PAD.

06:24.784 --> 06:28.188
THIS IS GREAT.
SO DO YOU HAVE NUMBERS IN MIND?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.090
- I GUESS THAT TASK HERE
IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.693
UM, I KIND OF DON'T REALLY WANT
TO SELL THE PLACE, UNLESS--

06:33.727 --> 06:35.095
YOU KNOW,
I'LL BE CANDID WITH YOU,

06:35.128 --> 06:37.097
UNLESS YOU CAN GET ME
A REALLY OBSCENE PRICE.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.665
- AN OBSCENE PRICE?
- OBSCENE PRICE.

06:38.698 --> 06:42.068
- [laughs]
WHAT PRICE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.804
- FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,
PLACES GO FOR

06:44.838 --> 06:46.973
$3,200, $3,400
A SQUARE FOOT,

06:47.073 --> 06:49.376
AND THOSE ARE KIND OF
AGGRESSIVE PRICES, SO...

06:49.409 --> 06:52.112
YOU KNOW, I'D WANT TO SORT OF
PRICE IT AT FOUR, AND SEE.

06:53.413 --> 06:57.584
- UH, IF YOU WANT TO PRICE IT
AT ABOUT $4,000 A FOOT,

06:57.617 --> 06:59.853
THAT PUTS US
A LITTLE OVER 15 MILLION.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.021
- YEAH.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.024
- $4,000 A FOOT
ON A SIDE STREET IN CHELSEA?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.258
THAT'S UNHEARD OF.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.828
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS
EXACTLY WHAT THE APARTMENT IS,

07:08.862 --> 07:11.231
IS THAT IT'S
A MASSIVE ONE-BEDROOM.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.533
MY BIGGEST CONCERN
IS PRICING IT TOO HIGH,

07:13.566 --> 07:15.368
AND HAVING IT SIT STALE
ON THE MARKET,

07:15.402 --> 07:16.469
AND THEN HAVING TO DO
A PRICE DROP.

07:16.503 --> 07:19.639
- MM-HMM.
- SO MY PROFESSIONAL ADVICE

07:19.673 --> 07:23.076
WOULD BE TO PRICE IT
WHERE I THINK IT WILL SELL,

07:23.109 --> 07:24.944
NOW THERE'S A LOT
THAT IT HAS GOING FOR IT.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.280
THE NEGATIVES ARE
THAT IT'S A HUGE ONE-BEDROOM.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.185
- I DON'T WANT TO
WASTE YOUR TIME.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.087
- MM-HMM.
- I WANT YOU TO BE SURE--

07:34.120 --> 07:36.056
TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
DON'T HAVE A MOTIVATED SELLER.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.692
I REALLY--THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO, AND IT'S--

07:38.725 --> 07:39.959
- BUT YOU NEED TO--BUT
YOU NEED TO MOVE THE PLACE,

07:40.060 --> 07:41.928
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
HOLD THIS AND MIAMI.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.229
- I DON'T NEED
TO MOVE THE PLACE.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.230
- I'M HAPPY--
- WELL, BUT YOU NEED TO--

07:44.264 --> 07:45.365
BUT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE HERE.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.599
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
- RIGHT.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.967
- AS A REAL ESTATE AGENT,
YOU OCCASIONALLY

07:48.068 --> 07:49.436
GET CLIENTS LIKE THIS.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.338
TOM SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME
IN MIAMI,

07:51.371 --> 07:53.606
SO HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IT
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FINANCIALLY

07:53.640 --> 07:54.974
TO HOLD ONTO THE PLACE,

07:55.075 --> 07:57.444
BUT HE'S GOT A STRONG
EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO IT,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.079
SO HE DOESN'T WANT TO LET IT GO,
EITHER.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.614
- THE PERFECT WORLD FOR ME WOULD
BE, WE'D GET A GOOD RENTER,

08:01.648 --> 08:04.117
AND REVISITS THE ISSUE
IN 18 MONTHS, 20 MONTHS.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.419
- SO YOU WOULD RENT IT.
- YEAH, I WANT TO RENT IT.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.887
- OKAY.

08:07.921 --> 08:08.855
- I DON'T WANT SOMEONE
WHO'S GONNA TRASH IT.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.156
- OKAY.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.658
- THINK PARTNER IN AN
ACCOUNTING FIRM, HOW ABOUT THAT?

08:11.691 --> 08:13.126
- SURE, AND YOU WANT TO RENT IT
FULLY FURNISHED,

08:13.159 --> 08:14.928
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO--
- YEAH.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.131
YEAH, WE'D RENT IT
FULLY FURNISHED.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.866
- I MEAN, HONESTLY,
A FAIR MARKET PRICE FOR THIS

08:19.899 --> 08:23.670
WOULD BE 25, SO I THINK WE COULD
MARKET IT, FULLY FURNISHED, 25.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.605
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.841
- RIGHT.
THERE'S NOTHING I'D LIKE MORE

08:27.874 --> 08:29.909
THAN A COMMISSION CHECK
ON A $15 MILLION SALE.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.846
HOWEVER, IF I FOCUS ON A RENTER,
I'D MAKE TOM HAPPY,

08:32.879 --> 08:35.048
AND THERE'S A MUCH BETTER CHANCE
THAT HE'LL CALL ME

08:35.048 --> 08:37.050
WHEN HE'S READY
TO TRULY PART WITH THE PLACE.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.819
SO YOU READY?

08:41.187 --> 08:42.455
- I'M READY.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.757
- OKAY, PERFECT.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.191
WE'LL SCHEDULE THE PHOTOGRAPHER
AND START MOVING.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.826
SOUND GOOD?
- YEAH. THANKS.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.061
- ALL RIGHT.
- GOOD MEETING YOU.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.063
- NICE TO MEET YOU,
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.345
- I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE NERVOUS
WHEN A DEVELOPER,

09:05.378 --> 09:06.780
PRETTY MUCH MY BOSS...
[buzzer]

09:06.813 --> 09:08.148
CALLS ME DOWN
TO HIS OFFICE.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.116
YOU KNOW, IT'S NEVER,
"CALM DOWN, AND LET ME TELL YOU

09:10.150 --> 09:11.651
WHAT A GREAT PERSON YOU ARE
TODAY."

09:11.685 --> 09:16.089
AND I'M ASSUMING IT'S A TALK
ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF 949 PARK,

09:16.122 --> 09:18.391

09:30.737 --> 09:35.108
- IT'S ONLY 95 DEGREES OUTSIDE.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.747
- WHEN I WALK INTO ZACH'S OFFICE
AND SEE FREDRIK SITTING THERE,

09:40.780 --> 09:45.251
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE
BEING KICKED IN THE GUT.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.487

BE A--YOU KNOW, A NICE MATCH

10:07.774 --> 10:10.944
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU UP THERE,
AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,

10:10.977 --> 10:13.646
THERE'S DIFFERENT SEGMENTS
OF THE MARKET THAT YOU BOTH

10:13.680 --> 10:15.382

THE COMBINATION OF

10:15.415 --> 10:18.218
THE BOTH OF YOU IS GONNA BE
A TERRIFIC MATCH-UP THERE,

10:18.251 --> 10:20.086

SOLD A LITTLE QUICKER.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.121

YEAH, WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT.
NO, IT'S GREAT.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.467
HALF MY COMMISSION,
SO TO SPEAK,

10:34.501 --> 10:38.004

10:39.706 --> 10:42.642
TOLD THIS 100 TIMES,
I'M A TEAM PLAYER.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.747
I THINK MICHAEL AND I ARE
GONNA BE A GREAT TEAM TOGETHER.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.717
HE'S GONNA LEARN A LOT FROM ME,

- OKAY.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.191
AND I NEED THEM TO BE HOT.

THING THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE

12:19.072 --> 12:23.076
IN THE HISTORY OF
NEW YORK CITY REAL ESTATE.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.412
I'M SO GOOD.
I AM SO GOOD AT WHAT I DO.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.847
- LET'S DO THIS THING.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.424
- UGH.

12:37.457 --> 12:41.494
THERE'S AN OPEN HOUSE COMING UP
THIS SUNDAY FOR 949 PARK,

12:41.528 --> 12:44.531
AND IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO STRATEGIZE WITH FREDRIK,

12:44.564 --> 12:48.435
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I'D RATHER DO LESS.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.738
[door bells chime]
- HEY!

12:51.771 --> 12:52.939
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:52.972 --> 12:53.973
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- SO SORRY I'M LATE.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.508
I WAS DOING
A SPEECH DOWNTOWN.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.344
- I LIKE PUBLIC SPEAKING.
I GOT INTO IT IN LAW SCHOOL.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.545
I WAS
A TERRIFIED LITTLE KID.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.046
I USED TO ALWAYS BE SCARED
TO RAISE MY HAND,

13:00.046 --> 13:01.348
'CAUSE I'D ALWAYS BE NERVOUS,
SWEATING.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.450
SO I'D START SWEATING IN HERE.
- ACTUAL SWEATING?

13:03.483 --> 13:04.718
NICE.
ACTUALLY SWEATING, YEAH.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.120
NO, I--MORE SO IN MY ARMPITS.
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.388
- YOU KNOW?

13:08.421 --> 13:11.191
SO I STARTED GETTING BOTOX
IN MY ARMPIT, WHICH...

13:11.224 --> 13:12.592
- DOES THAT WORK?
- INSURANCE COVERS,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.327
AND, YEAH, IT WORKS GREAT.
- MMM.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.129
- YEAH. BONE DRY.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.566
- BOTOX IN HIS ARMPITS.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.835
WHY WOULD YOU SHARE THAT
WITH ME RIGHT NOW?

13:21.868 --> 13:23.536
LET'S TALK BUSINESS.
- YEAH, LOVE TO.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.672
- I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED
AN INJECTION OF ENERGY.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.674
- WELL,
FREDRIK SAYS ENERGY,

13:27.707 --> 13:30.877
WHICH I THINK IS GREAT, AND ALL.
WHO DOESN'T LOVE ENERGY?

13:30.910 --> 13:32.379
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.447
- WHAT'S YOUR STYLE IN SELLING?
LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BRING,

13:34.481 --> 13:35.782
SINCE WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER,
LIKE--

13:35.815 --> 13:38.518
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, I BRING
MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA,

13:38.551 --> 13:40.253
THE MARKET, AND EVERYONE I KNOW
UP THERE LOOKING.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.088
- RIGHT.
- I'VE BEEN REACHING OUT

13:42.088 --> 13:44.357
TO A LOT OF BROKERS I'VE SHOWN
OTHER PARK AVENUE APARTMENTS TO.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.992
- OKAY.
I MEAN, I CAN JUST SAY ENERGY,

13:46.092 --> 13:47.627
BUT YEAH, I MEAN,
I BRING MY OWN ENERGY.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.129
- SO THIS IS YOUR STYLE?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.263
- I'M NOT BRINGING
ANYTHING NEW TO THE TABLE,

13:50.296 --> 13:51.898
I'M BRINGING WHAT I HAVE
AT THE TABLE.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.133
- I'M NOT--I'M NOT CRITICIZING.
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

13:53.166 --> 13:54.401
HOW WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER.
YOU KNOW,

13:54.434 --> 13:56.202
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE,
I WANT TO CHANGE SOME THINGS.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.672
I WANT TO TAKE DOWN
THAT WALLPAPER,

13:58.705 --> 14:00.440
THE BLACK AND WHITE,
IT'S SO BUSY FOR THE EYE.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.942
JUST ON THAT WALL. WHITE WALL,
THE ROOM IS GONNA FEEL LARGER.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.844
- REALLY? OKAY.
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.147
- I HAVE THE SAME WALLPAPER
IN MY HOUSE.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.349
I LOVE THE WAY IT LOOKS,
IT'S THE BEST QUALITY,

14:09.382 --> 14:11.051
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.054
FREDRIK, IF YOU HAD ANY TASTE,
YOU WOULD KNOW THAT.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.922
- SO ARE YOU GONNA BE AT THE
OPEN HOUSE WITH ME ON SUNDAY?

14:15.955 --> 14:17.691
- YEAH.
I'LL MAKE IT THERE.

14:17.724 --> 14:21.695
- WHY DON'T WE DO
A MEXICAN PARTY, WITH TEQUILA,

14:21.728 --> 14:22.862
FLOWERS, MUSIC.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.664
WE COULD HAVE IT CATERED
FROM THIS RESTAURANT,

14:24.698 --> 14:26.166
AND IT'S SO UNEXPECTED.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.234
- I WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE STAY AWAY FROM, LIKE,

14:28.268 --> 14:30.370
MAKING IT,
LIKE, CHEESY.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.873
- A MEXICAN FIESTA IS EXACTLY
THE RIGHT INJECTION OF ENERGY

14:33.907 --> 14:35.475
949 PARK NEEDS.

14:35.508 --> 14:39.746
I THINK THE WAY TO DO IT
IS JUST TO GET ON THE PHONE.

14:39.779 --> 14:44.651
ON THURSDAY NIGHT, AND YOU--
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO HELP ME,

14:44.684 --> 14:47.354
I'M GONNA SIT BETWEEN
5:00PM AND LIKE 10:00PM,

14:47.387 --> 14:50.390
MAYBE ALL NIGHT, AND CALL
EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY BROKER.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.092
I THINK
IT'S A NICE "G-ESTURE"

14:52.125 --> 14:53.626
TO HAVE A PHONE CALL...
- "GUESS?" OH, GESTURE.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.196
- FROM THE ACTUAL
LISTING AGENT, SAYING,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.098
"I PERSONALLY INVITE YOU
TO THE OPEN HOUSE."

14:58.098 --> 14:59.499
THE KEY IS TO HAVE
A LOT OF PEOPLE,

14:59.532 --> 15:00.667
'CAUSE, LIKE--
- AS OPPOSED TO AN OPEN HOUSE

15:00.700 --> 15:01.768
WITH NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE?
- NO, IT'S--

15:01.801 --> 15:03.036
- [laughs]
- MY POINT IS, YOU WALK IN,

15:03.069 --> 15:04.270
THERE'S TEN OTHER PEOPLE THERE.
YOU'RE LIKE,

15:04.304 --> 15:05.605
"WHOA, I GOTTA ACT, I GOTTA--"
[snaps fingers]

15:05.638 --> 15:06.940
- YOU KNOW, AND THEN YOU AND I
WILL BUILD THE MOMENTUM...

15:07.040 --> 15:08.208
- RIGHT.
- AND WE CAN GET

15:08.241 --> 15:10.510
A LOT OF BROKERS AND BUYERS
IN THERE ON SUNDAY.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.714
WE SUCCEEDED
WITH THIS REBRANCH--RELAUNCH--

15:14.748 --> 15:17.450
THESE CHIPS ARE GOOD.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.253
MMM.

15:20.286 --> 15:24.657
OKAY, SO, COMMISSION.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.926
YOU KNOW, I'M A TEAM PLAYER.
- MM-HMM.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.461
AND I'M REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS,

15:28.495 --> 15:30.530
SO REGARDLESS OF WHO DOES WHAT--
- I CAN TELL.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.965
RIGHT.
- LET'S DO 50/50.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.299
- OH, I AGREE, I MEAN--
- I'M GONNA BE DOING

15:33.333 --> 15:34.601
ALL THE WORK,
BUT I'M STILL GONNA GIVE YOU

15:34.634 --> 15:35.935
50% OF THE COMMISSION.
- HOW THE HELL ARE YOU

15:35.969 --> 15:37.070
DOING ALL THE WORK?
- HOW'S THAT?

15:37.103 --> 15:38.505
HOW'S THAT?
- I DON'T HIGH-FIVE.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.240
AH, CHIP.
- [laughs]

15:40.273 --> 15:42.242
I RESENT THAT, YOU'RE GONNA BE
DOING ALL THE WORK.

15:42.275 --> 15:46.212
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
WORKING A LOT AND WORKING SMART.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.981
- YEAH,
MAYBE YOU CAN TEACH ME.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.551
- YOU SPILLED
A BUNCH OF WATER ON YOU.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.852
- NO, I DIDN'T.

15:52.886 --> 15:53.987
- YEAH, YOU DID.
- WHERE IS IT?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.855
- RIGHT THERE.
THERE, THERE.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.557
NO, ON YOUR SHIRT.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.958
OH!

16:00.794 --> 16:02.095
GOOD THING
IT WAS JUST WATER.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.329
- [laughing] I KNOW.
- YOU DIDN'T EAT ANYTHING.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.698
- GOOD THING
YOU DIDN'T HAVE RED WINE.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.832
I JUST CAME FROM A LUNCH.
- I HAD--I HAD THREE CHIPS.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.500
- YOU CAN TAKE IT.
WE CAN GET A TO-GO BAG.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.680
- I BOOKED A HOTEL MEETING ROOM
FOR A LITTLE SESSION

16:20.714 --> 16:25.485
I LIKE TO CALL,
"RYAN'S CASTING COUCH."

16:25.518 --> 16:28.488
WHEN SELLING A PLACE, YOU REALLY
HAVE TO LOOK AT ITS STRENGTHS,

16:28.521 --> 16:29.723
AND THEN ACCENTUATE IT.

16:29.756 --> 16:33.860
MY NEW LISTING
AT 22nd STREET IS SEXY,

16:33.893 --> 16:36.162
SO MY STRATEGY
IS TO SEX IT UP.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.732

22:30.350 --> 22:32.485
WHEN A PROPERTY'S BEEN
SITTING ON THE MARKET TOO LONG,

22:32.519 --> 22:33.853
YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING FUN

22:33.887 --> 22:36.222

23:00.914 --> 23:04.084

23:29.309 --> 23:30.276

23:30.310 --> 23:32.512
- I PLAN ON IT,
AND I HAVE BEEN,

23:32.545 --> 23:33.813
BUT IT'S HARD
TO INVITE PEOPLE TO A PARTY,

23:33.847 --> 23:36.182

23:51.698 --> 23:52.732
I JUST DON'T WANT IT

25:29.229 --> 25:30.730

25:30.764 --> 25:31.831
JUST KEEP DOIN' THAT, "WHOO!"
- KEEP DOIN' IT.

25:31.865 --> 25:33.400
all: WHOO!

25:33.433 --> 25:34.968
- YEAH, AND EVERYONE'S LAUGHING.
OH, I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT.

25:35.068 --> 25:36.536
- THAT'S NICE.
YES, LAUGHING.

25:36.569 --> 25:37.871
[shutter clicks]

25:37.904 --> 25:40.306
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GET A CHAMPAGNE GLASS.

25:40.340 --> 25:42.642
[shutter clicks]

25:42.676 --> 25:44.110
YOU GUYS DO YOUR OWN THING.
TALK.

25:44.144 --> 25:47.080
HOW 'BOUT YOU TALK ABOUT
THE BEST DATE OF YOUR LIFE?

25:47.080 --> 25:48.682
WHICH WAS CLEARLY
THE DATE WE HAD, RIGHT?

25:48.715 --> 25:51.084
OKAY, CHEERS.
READY? ONE...TWO...THREE.

25:51.084 --> 25:53.153
- PERFECT.
- GOOD.

25:53.186 --> 25:54.888
- HAVING FUN?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.156
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

25:56.189 --> 25:58.425
- I KEEP THINKING ABOUT
OUR DATE THAT WE HAD.

25:58.458 --> 25:59.392
- REALLY?
- YEAH,

25:59.426 --> 26:00.560
I HAD A REALLY NICE TIME.
- YEAH?

26:00.593 --> 26:02.796
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- COOL.

26:02.829 --> 26:05.065
THAT WAS DEFINITELY,
DEFINITELY FUN.

26:05.098 --> 26:06.399
- HOW'S EVERYTHING BEEN GOING?
GOOD?

26:06.433 --> 26:07.500
- YEAH, IT'S REALLY GOOD.
- GOOD.

26:07.534 --> 26:09.035
- MMM.
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA TALK TO

26:09.035 --> 26:10.170
LEAH, AND THEN WE'LL, LIKE,
SWITCH OUTFITS, OR SOMETHING.

26:10.203 --> 26:11.538
- MM-HMM.

26:13.340 --> 26:15.308
- LOOK, I LIKE KELSEY,
BUT I WANT HER HERE TONIGHT

26:15.342 --> 26:17.944
IN A PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY,
YOU KNOW, NOT AS A GIRLFRIEND.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.212
- UM, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.381
JUST MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING'S NATURAL.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.716
THAT'S JUST--
THAT'S VERY NICE.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.050
[shutter clicks]
THERE YOU GO.

26:24.050 --> 26:27.187
NOW SLOWLY MOVE YOUR HAND
ALONG THE COUCH.

26:27.220 --> 26:29.589
JUST NATURALLY,
HOW YOU WOULD DO IT.

26:29.622 --> 26:30.724
FEEL IT, THAT EMOTION.

26:30.757 --> 26:31.791
- HAVE YOU BEEN MODELING
FOR AWHILE?

26:33.159 --> 26:36.096
- OH, WOW.
- THERE YOU GO.

26:36.129 --> 26:39.065
- LOOK BACK OVER
INTO THE WINDOW.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.267
- NOW PUT THAT ONE LEG DOWN.

26:41.301 --> 26:43.103
AND I WANT TO SEE,
IF YOU CHOOSE THE OTHER LEG...

26:46.506 --> 26:47.674
MAYBE WE SWITCH OUT?

26:47.707 --> 26:48.742
KELSEY,
MAYBE YOU WANT TO STEP OUT,

26:48.775 --> 26:49.809
- YEAH, LET'S DO IT.
- AND, MALINA,

26:49.843 --> 26:50.877
IF YOU GET IN THERE?
- OKAY.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.812
- KELSEY LOOKS GREAT
ON THE COUCH.

26:52.846 --> 26:54.080
ALL RIGHT, BUT I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

26:54.114 --> 26:55.215
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT,
LIKE, REALLY POPS,

26:55.248 --> 26:57.851
AND MALINA POPS.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.652
- GOOD.
- AWESOME.

26:59.686 --> 27:00.854
[shutter clicks]
- NICE.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.856
- THAT IS STUNNING.
- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.157
THAT'S GORGEOUS.
- YOU LOOK AMAZING.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.392
MALINA,
OH, MY GOODNESS.

27:05.425 --> 27:07.327
- YOU'RE LIKE,
THE CLASSIC, CLASSIC MODEL.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.762
- OH.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.033
- THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

27:14.567 --> 27:17.937
[shutter clicks]

27:18.038 --> 27:19.372
- TAKE YOUR HAIR DOWN.

27:19.406 --> 27:21.474
I WANT YOU TO--I THINK I JUST
WANT YOU TO BE MORE NATURAL.

27:21.508 --> 27:22.809
[shutter clicks]

27:22.842 --> 27:25.412
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GETTING THE FEELING.

27:25.445 --> 27:27.047
- OKAY, WELL,
GOOD THING WE GOT OTHER MODELS.

27:27.047 --> 27:28.448
HEY, MELISSA?

27:28.481 --> 27:30.350
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT
KELSEY'S CHECKED OUT, MENTALLY,

27:30.383 --> 27:31.918
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S BECAUSE

27:31.951 --> 27:33.086
SHE JUST WANTS ME
TO PAY ATTENTION TO HER,

27:33.119 --> 27:34.821
OR IF SHE'S JEALOUS,
OR SOMETHING,

27:34.854 --> 27:38.058
BUT THAT'S NOT MY STYLE,
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M WORKING.

27:38.058 --> 27:40.326
- BEAUTIFUL.

27:40.360 --> 27:43.063
- OH, YOU LOOK SO GREAT.

27:43.063 --> 27:46.199
- ARE YOU TRYING TO, LIKE,
STEAL MY HEART RIGHT NOW?

27:46.232 --> 27:50.337
- GORGEOUS.
[shutter clicks]

27:50.370 --> 27:52.539
- I'M KIND OF--I'M KIND OF
SPEECHLESS RIGHT NOW.

27:52.572 --> 27:53.740
- [laughs]
- THERE WE GO. OKAY.

27:53.773 --> 27:54.874
[shutter clicks]

27:54.908 --> 27:56.843
OH, THAT'S GORGEOUS.

27:58.478 --> 27:59.713
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

27:59.746 --> 28:00.747
- [scoffs]

28:02.415 --> 28:03.883
- OKAY.

28:03.917 --> 28:05.785
I'M USED TO WOMEN WALKING OUT
ON ME EVERY NOW AND THEN,

28:05.819 --> 28:08.021
BUT USUALLY THEY WAIT
UNTIL I DO SOMETHING WRONG.

28:08.021 --> 28:10.223
LET'S JUST GET MORE OF THESE.
THAT'S AWESOME.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.192
[shutter clicks]
- BEAUTIFUL.

28:12.225 --> 28:15.161
- YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL,
BY THE WAY.

28:15.195 --> 28:16.496
- STUNNING.
- I LIKE THAT, WHEN YOU'RE,

28:16.529 --> 28:18.465
LIKE, PLAYING WITH YOUR HAIR.
- THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.343
- I THINK THIS IS
ACTUALLY GONNA WORK.

28:30.377 --> 28:31.678
I AM JUST GONNA TIE IT--
- IT IS GONNA WORK.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.813
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
HOLD IT AND HELP ME.

28:33.847 --> 28:35.081
- OKAY.
- MICHAEL.

28:35.115 --> 28:38.051
- IT'S FIESTA TIME.
[snaps fingers]<i>OLE.</i>

28:38.051 --> 28:39.719
- HOW DO YOU--
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO'S GONNA WIN?

28:39.753 --> 28:41.421
LIKE,
WHO GETS TO DO THIS?

28:41.454 --> 28:42.856
- WELL, NO ONE REALLY WINS.
- 'CAUSE I KIND OF WANT TO--

28:42.889 --> 28:45.058
- TRADITIONALLY, YOU SMACK IT,
THEN IT OPENS UP A PIECE,

28:45.058 --> 28:46.426
AND SOMEONE ELSE GOES,
THEN IT FALLS,

28:46.459 --> 28:48.695
AND KIDS GRAB ALL THE CANDY.
- OKAY.

28:48.728 --> 28:53.066
- IN SWEDEN ON MIDSUMMER EVE,
WE DRESS UP AS FROGS,

28:53.066 --> 28:55.435
AND WE SING TOGETHER,
HOLDING EACH OTHER'S TAILS.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.070
[laughs]

28:57.103 --> 28:58.438
IN CIRCLES.

28:58.471 --> 29:02.575
[singing in Swedish]

29:02.609 --> 29:06.146
IT'S A BETTER KID'S GAME,
I THINK.

29:06.179 --> 29:07.781
- OH, IT LOOKS GREAT.
- OH, LOOK AT THE WALL.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.115
REMEMBER?
- OH, YOU GOT RID OF

29:09.149 --> 29:12.318
THE WALLPAPER.
- ITS SO MUCH NICER.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.722
DON'T YOU THINK?

29:15.755 --> 29:17.323
- I LIKED THE WALLPAPER,
SO--

29:17.357 --> 29:18.858
- NO, IT LOOKS SO MUCH BIGGER
AND BRIGHTER.

29:18.892 --> 29:20.760
LOOK AT THIS BIG ROOM.

29:20.794 --> 29:22.462
OKAY, I THINK
WE'RE READY FOR PARTY.

29:22.495 --> 29:23.430
[Mexican music]

29:23.463 --> 29:25.198
* *

29:25.231 --> 29:27.334
OKAY, GUYS, COME IN.

29:27.367 --> 29:29.202
HI.
[kissing]

29:29.235 --> 29:30.704
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

29:32.739 --> 29:34.541
FOR YOU GUYS WHO HAVEN'T
BEEN TO THE BUILDING,

29:34.574 --> 29:37.711
THANKS ALL
FOR COMING TO 949 PARK.

29:37.744 --> 29:41.715
SO THIS UNIT IS
JUST UNDER 2,000 SQUARE FEET.

29:41.748 --> 29:45.418
WE HAVE SIX UNITS IN TOTAL,
SO I HOPE YOU HAVE SOME CLIENTS

29:45.452 --> 29:48.555
THAT YOU WOULD BRING IN, AND
WE WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.

29:48.588 --> 29:51.157
IT'S TWO MASTER SUITES,
ACTUALLY, UPSTAIRS,

29:51.191 --> 29:53.526
AND THEN THE LIVING ROOM IS IN
THE FRONT, WHICH IS FACING PARK,

29:53.560 --> 29:55.595
AND YOU HAVE
FLOOR-TO-CEILING GLASS.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.664
- AT THIS POINT, NOTHING
SURPRISES ME ABOUT FREDRIK.

29:57.697 --> 29:59.065
HE DOES THE FIRST TOUR
WITHOUT ME.

29:59.099 --> 30:01.434
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE DEAL WITH THIS GUY IS.

30:01.468 --> 30:04.004
I'M NOT FREDRIK'S ASSISTANT,
I'M HIS PARTNER ON THIS DEAL.

30:04.037 --> 30:08.141
- THEY START AT $3,975,000,
AND THEY GO UP TO $6 MILLION.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.542
AND I HOPE YOU LIKE
THE FINISHES.

30:09.576 --> 30:11.511
WE JUST DID SOME CHANGES
IN THIS APARTMENT.

30:11.544 --> 30:12.812
WE CHANGED THE WALLPAPER.

30:12.846 --> 30:14.981
THIS ACTUALLY USED TO BE
THAT WALLPAPER,

30:15.015 --> 30:17.384
AND WE REMOVED IT.
DO YOU LIKE IT MORE WHITE,

30:17.417 --> 30:19.753
OR DO YOU LIKE THE OLD--
YOU LIKE THE WHITE.

30:19.786 --> 30:21.087
[general agreement]

30:21.121 --> 30:22.989
- WHATEVER.

30:23.023 --> 30:25.592
FREDRIK WAS WALKING AROUND
LIKE A PUFFED-UP ASSHOLE.

30:25.625 --> 30:27.660
THAT'S FINE.
HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS.

30:27.694 --> 30:29.129
ME, I'M GONNA FOCUS
ON THE WORK,

30:29.162 --> 30:30.530
AND WHAT I CAN
CONTRIBUTE HERE TODAY.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.332
- ARE WE GONNA GET SOME
BROCHURES, OR--

30:32.365 --> 30:34.200
- YES, YES, THEY'RE
ALL DOWNSTAIRS IN THE LOBBY.

30:34.234 --> 30:36.136
THE FLOOR PLANS,
THE BROCHURES, ABSOLUTELY.

30:36.169 --> 30:37.404
- I'LL PICK THEM UP, YES.
- EVERYTHING'S THERE.

30:37.437 --> 30:39.305
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- VERY WELL, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

30:39.339 --> 30:41.574
- YEAH, I'M--I'M GLAD. I JUST
FEEL LIKE I COULD CLONE MYSELF,

30:41.608 --> 30:43.076
SO I COULD LIKE--
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE,

30:43.109 --> 30:44.377
I WANT TO
TALK TO EVERYBODY.

30:44.411 --> 30:46.579
[overlapping chatter]

30:46.613 --> 30:48.882
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.650
- ISN'T THAT GREAT? THE VIEW?
- JUST AMAZING.

30:50.684 --> 30:51.718
YOU CAN SEE--
- AND I LOVE NOW

30:51.751 --> 30:53.186
HOW THE TREES ARE FILLING IN,
AND--

30:53.219 --> 30:55.221
- WELL, THE APARTMENT BELOW,
IT'S PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL,

30:55.255 --> 30:57.090
BUT THEN THERE'S
THE ADDITIONAL ROOF DECK,

30:57.123 --> 30:58.825
WITH A LITTLE ROOM THERE,
THAT'S LIKE A KITCHEN.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.394
WHERE'D YOU GO?
- HAVE YOU SEEN UPSTAIRS YET?

31:01.428 --> 31:02.295
- NO, NOT YET.
- NO? COME ON,

31:02.328 --> 31:03.363
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

31:03.396 --> 31:06.366
[overlapping chatter]

31:06.399 --> 31:07.834
- COMING UP...

31:07.867 --> 31:10.670
- HEY, LOOK, IF THIS PLACE IS
IN YOUR BUDGET, I MEAN, I HAVE--

31:10.704 --> 31:12.172
I'M JUST GONNA
CHECK MY BASES HERE.

31:12.205 --> 31:13.707
I MEAN, I HAVE A PLACE
DOWN ON WAVERLY--

31:13.740 --> 31:15.742
- OF COURSE I SEE
WHAT RYAN'S UP TO.

31:15.775 --> 31:17.310
IT IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL.

31:17.344 --> 31:19.479
- GEE, I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD.
SEE MY CARD?

31:19.512 --> 31:25.151
DON'T TELL ANY OF THE BROKERS
HERE I GAVE YOU MY CARD, THOUGH.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.226
- LOOK AT THIS WINDOW,
IT'S PROBABLY TEN BY TEN.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.728
- THEY DID SUCH A GREAT JOB
ON THE FINISHES.

31:34.761 --> 31:37.597
- THEY REALLY DID, THE FINISHES
ARE VERY, VERY SPECIAL.

31:38.765 --> 31:41.267
[overlapping chatter]

31:41.301 --> 31:43.536
- YEAH,
THE KEYS WEREN'T THERE.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.105
THIS PROPERTY'S
A PRETTY BIG DEAL,

31:45.105 --> 31:47.941
BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY
NEW CONDOS COMING UP ON PARK,

31:47.974 --> 31:49.576
SO A CONDO ON
THE UPPER EAST SIDE IS HUGE,

31:49.609 --> 31:51.144
AND THIS BROKERS OPEN
IS SOMETHING

31:51.177 --> 31:52.645
THAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT,
AND I'M NOT GONNA MISS IT,

31:52.679 --> 31:54.114
AND I DON'T CARE
WHO'S HOSTING.

31:54.114 --> 31:55.882
- SO LET'S DO SHOTS.
WHO'S THAT?

31:55.915 --> 31:56.916
OH, [bleep].
- I DIDN'T KNOW

31:56.950 --> 31:58.385
YOU CAME TO CHINATOWN.
- OH, NO!

31:58.418 --> 32:00.487
IS THIS CHINATOWN?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

32:00.520 --> 32:04.224
- I FEEL HONORED. THIS RYAN IS--
KEEP COMING TO MY OPEN HOUSES.

32:09.696 --> 32:11.498
- ADDED ON?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

32:11.531 --> 32:13.500
- NO, IT MEANS--

32:13.533 --> 32:15.268
- I--YOU KNOW--

32:15.301 --> 32:16.503
- HOW YOU GUYS DOIN'?

32:19.673 --> 32:20.640
- WHY IS WHAT?

32:20.674 --> 32:21.975
- WHY I WAS ADDED ON
TO THE BUILDING.

32:22.075 --> 32:23.677
- WELL, I MEAN,
IT WENT BACK AND FORTH FROM--

32:23.710 --> 32:24.878
- SO HOW DOES THIS WORK?

32:34.454 --> 32:36.690
- SO IT SAT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE, RIGHT?

32:36.723 --> 32:38.491
I DON'T KNOW MICHAEL LORBER
REALLY WELL,

32:38.525 --> 32:40.527
BUT I CAN DEFINITELY SENSE
THAT THERE'S SOME TENSION

32:40.560 --> 32:43.363
BETWEEN HIM AND FREDRIK,
WHICH I'M SURE

32:43.396 --> 32:45.331
IS PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE
FOR THEM,

32:45.365 --> 32:47.133
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY
ENTERTAINING FOR ME.

32:49.302 --> 32:50.537
SO THIS IS LIKE
THE GUEST MASTER SUITE.

32:50.570 --> 32:51.671
- YEAH,
IT'S A LITTLE SMALLER THAN--

32:51.705 --> 32:53.106
- AND THEY'RE
ALL DUPLEXES, RIGHT?

32:53.106 --> 32:54.908
- YEAH, BUT LOOK AT THE
CEILINGS, THEY'RE NICE, RIGHT?

32:54.941 --> 32:56.876
THE SPEAKERS.
- IT'S REALLY HIGH-END.

32:56.910 --> 32:58.111
I MEAN,
IT'S A JEWEL BOX BUILDING,

32:58.111 --> 32:59.612
SO IT'S GOT
A LOT OF GREAT DETAIL.

32:59.646 --> 33:01.247
- WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?
- A JEWEL BOX.

33:01.281 --> 33:03.049
- OH, I'M GONNA USE THAT
IN THE SHOWINGS FROM NOW ON.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.284
- [laughs]
- I LIKE THAT.

33:04.317 --> 33:07.153
- SO DO YOU BOTH SHOW?
- I SHOW.

33:07.187 --> 33:09.456
SO I SAW YOU HAVE
A NEW LISTING, UH...

33:09.489 --> 33:11.057
- YES.
- AT 22nd STREET?

33:11.057 --> 33:12.092
- YES.

33:12.125 --> 33:15.862
- IT SEEMS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE,
MAYBE.

33:15.895 --> 33:17.897
- IT'S VERY ACCURATELY PRICED
FOR RENT.

33:17.931 --> 33:20.066
- NEXT TIME YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY
TO A LISTING APPOINTMENT,

33:20.066 --> 33:23.803
CALL ME, I'LL GO WITH YOU,
AND WE'LL PRICE IT TOGETHER.

33:23.837 --> 33:25.638
- I LIVE BY
THE GOLDEN RULE,

33:25.672 --> 33:27.207
NOT JUST IN REAL ESTATE,
BUT IN LIFE.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.209
I TREAT OTHERS THE WAY
I'D WANT TO BE TREATED.

33:29.242 --> 33:31.211
GUYS LIKE FREDRIK AND RYAN,
IT'S CUTTHROAT WITH THEM,

33:31.244 --> 33:32.379
IT'S WAR.

33:32.412 --> 33:34.214
I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE
TO GET ALONG WITH THEM,

33:34.247 --> 33:35.348
OR DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.

33:35.382 --> 33:36.950
OKAY, WELL,
YOU WANT TO SEE THE MASTER?

33:36.983 --> 33:38.218
- YES.
- MAYBE WE COULD

33:38.251 --> 33:39.686
HAVE SOME TEQUILA.
- LET'S DO IT.

33:39.719 --> 33:45.191
[general chatter]

33:45.225 --> 33:47.160
- SO DO YOU HAVE A BUYER?
- I HAVE A LOT OF BUYERS.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.461
- OKAY, GOOD.

33:48.495 --> 33:50.764
- HEY, MIKE. HOW ARE YOU DOIN'?
- OH, HOW ARE YOU?

33:50.797 --> 33:52.165
- HOW ARE YOU?
[kissing]

33:52.198 --> 33:55.235
- HEY, LOOK, IF THIS PLACE
IS IN YOUR BUDGET, I HAVE...

33:55.268 --> 33:56.736
LET ME JUST KIND OF
CHECK MY BASES HERE,

33:56.770 --> 33:58.805
I MEAN, I HAVE A PLACE
DOWN ON WAVERLY.

33:58.838 --> 34:00.106
- ON WAVERLY?
- WAVERLY, IN THE VILLAGE.

34:00.140 --> 34:01.841
- OH, YEAH. YEAH.
- YOU KNOW THE VILLAGE? YEAH.

34:01.875 --> 34:05.045
I'M AT
ANOTHER BROKER'S OPEN HOUSE,

34:05.045 --> 34:07.113
AND ONE OF THE BEST THINGS
ABOUT THAT IS THAT

34:07.147 --> 34:10.183
THERE ARE
OTHER POTENTIAL BUYERS THERE,

34:10.216 --> 34:12.352
AND MAYBE
THEY DON'T LIKE THIS PLACE.

34:12.385 --> 34:13.720
MAYBE
THEY DON'T LIKE THE BROKERS

34:13.753 --> 34:15.055
THAT ARE HOLDING
THE OPEN HOUSE.

34:15.055 --> 34:17.190
- GEE, I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD.
HERE'S MY CARD.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.059
DON'T TELL ANY OTHER BROKERS
HERE I GAVE YOU MY CARD, THOUGH,

34:19.059 --> 34:20.293
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF
THEIR PARTY.

34:20.326 --> 34:21.327
- IT'S COMPETITION.
- I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD.

34:21.361 --> 34:23.797
- THIS IS
A FANCY CARD, MAN.

34:23.830 --> 34:27.067
- OF COURSE I SEE WHAT RYAN'S
UP TO. IT IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL.

34:27.100 --> 34:29.069
- I ACTUALLY HAVE A REALLY
COOL CARD, YOU CAN'T RIP IT UP.

34:29.069 --> 34:31.671
- BUT I'M NOT GONNA STOOP DOWN
TO HIS LEVEL RIGHT NOW,

34:31.705 --> 34:33.073
AND CONFRONT HIM.

34:33.106 --> 34:36.276
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO WAIT
AND PICK YOUR BATTLES.

34:36.309 --> 34:37.477
- OH, WOW,
LOOK AT THIS.

34:37.510 --> 34:38.445
[glasses clink]

34:38.478 --> 34:41.147
[overlapping chatter]

34:41.181 --> 34:42.415
- ARE YOU TWO GUYS
GETTING ALONG, OR--

34:42.449 --> 34:43.883
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- I ACTUALLY--

34:43.917 --> 34:45.352
I REALLY--NO, I REALLY
ENJOY WORKING WITH HIM.

34:45.385 --> 34:47.087
- GOOD.
- AND I'M VERY HAPPY AT ELLIMAN.

34:47.087 --> 34:49.589
- I TELL CHRIS EVERY DAY,
I'M REALLY, REALLY HAPPY.

34:49.622 --> 34:51.291
- VERY LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

34:51.324 --> 34:52.726
- AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE WALL?

34:52.759 --> 34:54.127
ISN'T IT NICER NOW,
WHEN IT'S WHITE.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.895
- LIKE, REMEMBER THERE WAS
THAT PAISLEY WALLPAPER THERE?

34:55.929 --> 34:57.263
- IT WAS TOO MUCH, RIGHT?
- YEAH, I FORGOT.

34:57.297 --> 34:58.565
IT WAS TOO MUCH, YEAH.
- [laughs]

34:58.598 --> 34:59.733
- I'M NOT THAT BIG FOR--
I'M NOT THAT BIG FOR--

34:59.766 --> 35:01.301
- I--
- I'M NOT THAT BIG FOR COLORS.

35:01.334 --> 35:02.769
- I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED
OF FREDRIK.

35:02.802 --> 35:04.604
HE LEAVES MY NAME
OFF THE INVITATION,

35:04.637 --> 35:06.172
DOES THE TOURS
WITHOUT ME,

35:06.206 --> 35:09.142
HE UNDERMINES ME IN FRONT OF
MY FATHER, WHO'S ALSO MY BOSS.

35:09.175 --> 35:12.212
I CANNOT HANDLE
WORKING WITH HIM.

35:12.245 --> 35:13.646
- ARE YOU LEAVING?

35:15.181 --> 35:19.185
- IT'S JUST NOT PROFESSIONAL,
THE WAY HE'S TREATING ME.

35:27.894 --> 35:34.467
- [grunting]

35:34.501 --> 35:37.070
OKAY. AWESOME

35:37.103 --> 35:38.438
[grunts]

35:38.471 --> 35:40.340
I BLEW UP THE MODEL PHOTOS
THAT I USED FOR MARKETING.

35:40.373 --> 35:42.342
I'M BRINGING THEM
TO THE OPEN HOUSE,

35:42.375 --> 35:43.643
BUT THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE
A CENTER OF FOCUS.

35:43.677 --> 35:45.612
THEY'RE, YOU KNOW,
CONVERSATION POINTS.

35:45.645 --> 35:47.180
SWEET.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.082
'CAUSE THE LAST THING I WANT IS
SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA DETRACT

35:49.082 --> 35:51.418
FROM HOW AWESOME
THE ACTUAL SPACE REALLY IS.

35:51.451 --> 35:52.752
AH.

35:55.689 --> 35:57.590
[sniffs]

35:57.624 --> 36:01.027
THERE'S, LIKE, SOME SMELL
COMING FROM THE SINK.

36:01.061 --> 36:03.329
[water running]
UGH.

36:03.363 --> 36:06.132
OH.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.501
I HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE
STARTING IN 45 MINUTES.

36:08.535 --> 36:10.437
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
TOTALLY CLEAN UP A KITCHEN

36:10.470 --> 36:12.706
THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED
BY SOME PARTY THE NIGHT BEFORE.

36:12.739 --> 36:14.040
[phone beeps]

36:14.074 --> 36:17.110
HEY, DINA, IT'S RYAN.
I'M AT 22nd STREET,

36:17.143 --> 36:19.779
PREPARING FOR THE OPEN HOUSE.
THIS APARTMENT IS A MESS.

36:19.813 --> 36:23.049
THAT'S WHY I PAY MONEY
TO HAVE AN ASSISTANT.

36:23.049 --> 36:26.553
- MOTHER [bleep].

36:26.586 --> 36:28.488
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M DOING THIS
RIGHT NOW.

36:28.521 --> 36:31.157
I DON'T EVEN
DO MY OWN DISHES.

36:34.894 --> 36:35.895
HA.

36:35.929 --> 36:38.198
[doorbell rings]

36:38.231 --> 36:39.833
HOLD ON!

36:41.167 --> 36:42.369
- HELLO.
- HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

36:42.402 --> 36:43.670
- HEY, RYAN, HOW ARE YOU?
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

36:43.703 --> 36:45.438
- HEY, GOOD TO MEET YOU.
- JARED. NICE TO MEET YOU.

36:45.472 --> 36:46.673
- JARED.
GOOD TO SEE YA.

36:46.706 --> 36:47.974
JAMES, WHAT'S UP, MAN?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

36:48.074 --> 36:49.509
- SO HOW MANY SQUARE FEET
IN HERE?

36:49.542 --> 36:51.311
- UH, ROUGHLY 3,600.

36:51.344 --> 36:52.645
IT'S A NICE, BOUTIQUE
LITTLE BUILDING.

36:52.679 --> 36:53.780
IT'S A VIRTUAL DOORMAN.

36:53.813 --> 36:55.648
AND IT'S ON THE MARKET
FOR RENT FOR 25.

36:55.682 --> 36:57.384
AND THEN IF YOU SEE,
WE TOOK LISTING PHOTOS

36:57.417 --> 36:59.152
THAT WE PUT IN THE BROCHURE
THERE,

36:59.185 --> 37:01.454
BUT THEN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
WANT TO TAKE A LOOK HERE.

37:01.488 --> 37:03.323
SO THIS--WE ALSO
HAD MODELS COME IN.

37:03.356 --> 37:04.758
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU RECOGNIZE THIS GUY.

37:04.791 --> 37:07.027
- [laughs]
- RIGHT?

37:07.027 --> 37:08.595
SO IF YOU
TAKE THIS APARTMENT,

37:08.628 --> 37:10.096
THERE'S A LOT OF SEX
YOU CAN HAVE IN THIS APARTMENT.

37:10.130 --> 37:13.500
- CAN WE HAVE THE PHOTO?
[laughter]

37:13.533 --> 37:14.868
- OF COURSE I'M GONNA
MILK THE PARTY LIFESTYLE

37:14.901 --> 37:16.870
AS MUCH AS I CAN
DURING THE OPEN HOUSE.

37:16.903 --> 37:18.138
HEY, MAN.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

37:18.171 --> 37:19.305
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

37:19.339 --> 37:20.674
BUT BEING
A GOOD REAL ESTATE AGENT

37:20.707 --> 37:23.043
ALSO MEANS
FEELING OUT YOUR CUSTOMERS.

37:23.076 --> 37:24.577
SOME PEOPLE YOU CAN LOOK AT,

37:24.611 --> 37:26.446
AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN HIGHLIGHT
CERTAIN FEATURES.

37:26.479 --> 37:28.448
AND ALSO THERE'S
A FULL BATHROOM DOWN HERE,

37:28.481 --> 37:31.685
AND THE SINK CAN WITHSTAND
THE WEIGHT OF 500 POUNDS.

37:31.718 --> 37:33.053
- NICE.
- YEAH.

37:33.086 --> 37:34.788
- AND THAT COMES IN HANDY.
- THAT DOES COME IN HANDY.

37:34.821 --> 37:35.922
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHERS

37:35.955 --> 37:37.857
WHO YOU TALK ABOUT
THE OTHER THINGS WITH.

37:37.891 --> 37:40.060
YOU HAVE
TWO DISHWASHERS HERE.

37:40.060 --> 37:41.327
AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE

37:41.361 --> 37:43.296
YOU GOTTA FEEL OUT
A LITTLE MORE FIRST.

37:43.329 --> 37:45.331
- WHAT DO YOU DO?
- UH, I WORK IN FINANCE.

37:45.365 --> 37:46.366
- OKAY.
- I'M A TRADER.

37:46.399 --> 37:47.500
- AND DO YOU
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

37:47.534 --> 37:49.102
- NO.
- DO--DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

37:49.135 --> 37:50.403
TO A WIFE, OR KIDS,
OR ANYTHING?

37:50.437 --> 37:51.871
- NO, NO, NO.
- SO I THINK THIS MIGHT JUST

37:51.905 --> 37:53.606
BE THE PLACE FOR YOU.
- I THINK SO.

37:53.640 --> 37:57.711
WHAT ARE THE NEIGHBORS LIKE,
WITH KIND OF LATE-NIGHT NOISE,

37:57.744 --> 37:59.312
OR ANYTHING?
- YES.

37:59.346 --> 38:00.447
- YEAH?
- I MEAN, DUDE, THIS IS, LIKE,

38:00.480 --> 38:02.215
THE QUINTESSENTIAL
PARTY PALACE.

38:02.248 --> 38:03.750
- OKAY.

38:03.783 --> 38:06.019
- IS THAT WHAT YOU DO?
- YEAH, IT'S KIND OF...

38:06.019 --> 38:06.920
MORE MY SCENE.
- WHAT YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR?

38:07.020 --> 38:08.221
- YEAH, YEAH.

38:08.254 --> 38:09.656
- SO THAT' WHO YOU BRING HOME.
- OKAY.

38:09.689 --> 38:11.057
YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.
- YOU COULD DO THAT?

38:11.091 --> 38:12.459
- DEFINITELY.
- YEAH.

38:12.492 --> 38:13.660
SO SHE LIVES DOWN BY
WALL STREET, I'LL GIVE YOU

38:13.693 --> 38:14.728
HER ADDRESS, I ACTUALLY
GOT IT WHEN SHE WAS HERE.

38:14.761 --> 38:16.029
- [laughs]

38:16.062 --> 38:19.432
- ADAM'S THE CLASSIC
SMART WALL STREET GUY

38:19.466 --> 38:21.301
WHO WANTS TO SHOW
HIS MONEY OFF.

38:21.334 --> 38:23.570
I DON'T WANT TO JUMP THE GUN,
BUT I KIND OF SEE YOU HERE.

38:23.603 --> 38:26.139
- IT'S PRETTY--
PRETTY FITTING, I'D SAY.

38:26.172 --> 38:27.173
- YEAH.

38:27.207 --> 38:28.775
- I MEAN,
I LIKE IT A LOT.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.877
- BUT IF YOU HAVE PARTIES,
YOU HAVE TO INVITE ME.

38:30.910 --> 38:33.079
- YOU'RE IN.

38:41.621 --> 38:44.391
[car horns honking]

38:44.424 --> 38:46.493
- HOW'S TRAFFIC BEEN TODAY?
IT'S BEEN BRUTAL

38:46.526 --> 38:48.061
THE LAST FEW DAYS.
- YEAH, EVERYWHERE.

38:48.061 --> 38:50.597
[cell phone rings]
HELLO, THIS IS RYAN.

38:52.499 --> 38:54.734
- ADAM, FROM THE OPEN HOUSE.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, MAN?

38:56.436 --> 38:59.072
YOU THINK YOU LIKE IT?
DUDE, I KNEW IT.

38:59.072 --> 39:00.206
I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA LEAVE THERE,

39:00.240 --> 39:02.008
AND YOU WOULD
WANT TO COME BACK IMMEDIATELY.

39:02.008 --> 39:03.076
- [laughs]

39:05.812 --> 39:07.080
- AND DO YOU WANT IT--
DO YOU WANT IT FURNISHED?

39:07.113 --> 39:09.115
DID YOU
THINK ABOUT THAT AT ALL?

39:20.360 --> 39:24.030
- LOOK, WE'RE ASKING
$25,000 A MONTH FOR IT,

39:24.064 --> 39:26.466
AND $20,000, I MEAN,
IT SOUNDS GOOD,

39:26.499 --> 39:29.769
BUT THAT'S 20% OFF, MAN,
THAT'S--THAT'S HEFTY.

39:31.104 --> 39:33.707
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS, ADAM, MAN,
THANKS FOR CALLIN'.

39:35.175 --> 39:36.776
- COMING UP...
- SO I HAVE GOOD NEWS.

39:36.810 --> 39:38.678
LET'S HEAR IT.
- $20,000 A MONTH.

39:38.712 --> 39:39.913
THAT'S NOT
GONNA BE ENOUGH--

39:39.946 --> 39:41.281
ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH.

39:50.824 --> 39:51.958
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?
WELCOME.

39:52.058 --> 39:53.393
- THANK YOU.
- HAVE YOU EVER

39:53.426 --> 39:55.128
POPPED IN HERE BEFORE?
- NO, IT'S A CUTE LITTLE STORE,

39:55.161 --> 39:58.898
AND I LIKE ALL THIS COLOR.
SO I'M THINKING, UM,

39:58.932 --> 40:01.101
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

40:01.134 --> 40:03.570
NOT IN LOVE WITH IT.
- NO?

40:03.603 --> 40:04.771
- OH, YEAH,
THAT IS NOT GOOD.

40:04.804 --> 40:06.239
- MMM, I DON'T LIKE IT.
- DONE.

40:06.272 --> 40:08.308
THAT IS A GREAT JACKET.
- IS THIS HUGH HEFNER'S?

40:08.341 --> 40:09.909
- YES.
- I DON'T HAVE ANY BUNNIES

40:09.943 --> 40:10.877
IN MY LIFE...
- NO?

40:10.910 --> 40:12.245
SO IT'S NOT
GONNA BE FOR ME.

40:12.278 --> 40:14.014
I MEAN, REALLY EARLY
IN MY REAL ESTATE CAREER,

40:14.047 --> 40:16.483
I REALIZED THERE'S
A DIRECT CORRELATION,

40:16.516 --> 40:19.619
FOR ME, AT LEAST,
DRESSING WELL AND ACTING WELL.

40:19.652 --> 40:22.122
IF I DRESS UP IN A REALLY
EXPENSIVE, BEAUTIFUL SUIT

40:22.155 --> 40:23.790
IN THE MORNING,
I'M GONNA SELL MORE REAL ESTATE.

40:23.823 --> 40:24.958
- AND THIS IS GONNA BE
TOTALLY YOU.

40:24.991 --> 40:26.893
- NO.
- I THINK THIS WOULD BE GREAT

40:26.926 --> 40:28.228
AS AN ALTERNATIVE.
- SO BORING.

40:28.261 --> 40:29.863
- NO? TOO BORING?
- SO BORING.

40:29.896 --> 40:32.165
- THAT'S KILLER.
- REALLY?

40:36.736 --> 40:40.607
I LIKE THE SHIRT, THAT I WANT.
I'LL BUY THIS ONE.

40:40.640 --> 40:45.712
- THAT'S $448, PLEASE.
- GREAT.

40:51.785 --> 40:54.254
- SO I HAVE GOOD NEWS.
- LET'S HEAR IT.

40:54.287 --> 40:56.690
- SINCE TOM, THE OWNER OF
MY LISTING AT 22nd STREET,

40:56.723 --> 40:59.726
IS NOW BACK IN MIAMI, HE'S PUT
CHRISTIAN, HIS BUSINESS PARTNER,

40:59.759 --> 41:01.928
IN CHARGE OF
ANY AND ALL NEGOTIATIONS.

41:01.961 --> 41:03.563
WE HAD, UH,
WE HAD THE OPEN HOUSE.

41:03.596 --> 41:04.964
- GREAT.

41:05.065 --> 41:06.666
- AND THERE WAS ONE GUY THAT
CAME THROUGH THAT MADE AN OFFER.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.068
- OKAY.
- AND HIS STARTING OFFER

41:08.101 --> 41:09.636
IS $20,000 A MONTH.

41:11.638 --> 41:13.206
- WHY THE BIG DISCOUNT HERE?

41:13.239 --> 41:15.975
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT WE'RE PREPARED TO--

41:16.076 --> 41:17.210
TO ACCEPT.
- YEAH, I THINK

41:17.243 --> 41:19.079
HE'S PLAYING HARDBALL
BY MAKING A LOWER OFFER

41:19.112 --> 41:20.413
THAT'S ABOUT 20% OFF.
- OKAY.

41:20.447 --> 41:22.415
- BUT I KNOW--
I KNOW HE WANTS IT.

41:22.449 --> 41:24.551
I CAN SEE IT ON HIS FACE.
I MEAN, THE ONLY ISSUE, THOUGH,

41:24.584 --> 41:25.685
IS THAT HE WANTS IT
FULLY-FURNISHED,

41:25.719 --> 41:27.554
AND HE WANTS
ALL OF THE ARTWORK TO STAY,

41:27.587 --> 41:30.090
AND I THINK HE'LL PROBABLY DO
A STANDARD INSURANCE POLICY

41:30.090 --> 41:32.225
FOR A RENTER
FOR HALF A MILLION.

41:32.258 --> 41:34.728
- THAT'S NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH--
ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH.

41:34.761 --> 41:36.329
- OKAY.
- THAT'S...

41:36.363 --> 41:38.365
VALUABLE STUFF IN THERE.
ANYTHING GOES WRONG,

41:38.398 --> 41:41.101
AND THAT'S--
THAT'S A NIGHTMARE.

41:41.101 --> 41:42.202
- I MEAN,
I CAN GET HIM TO DO

41:42.235 --> 41:43.503
WHATEVER INSURANCE POLICY
YOU WANT.

41:43.536 --> 41:45.405
I MEAN, I THINK
A $2 MILLION INSURANCE POLICY

41:45.438 --> 41:47.374
IS PROBABLY WHAT'S FAIR.
- OKAY.

41:47.407 --> 41:49.242
- LET ME CATCH HIM
BEFORE THE MARKET CLOSES,

41:49.275 --> 41:51.311
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- OKAY.

41:52.512 --> 41:54.948
[phone rings]

41:54.981 --> 41:56.516
- ADAM, THIS IS RYAN SERHANT
FROM NEST SEEKERS, HOW ARE YOU?

41:58.218 --> 41:59.786
- THEY'RE STICKIN'
TO THEIR GUNS, MAN.

41:59.819 --> 42:01.287
HE'S STICKIN' TO 25.

42:01.321 --> 42:03.957
I THINK I CAN GET THE DEAL DOWN,
SOMEWHERE AROUND 23,

42:04.057 --> 42:06.226
BECAUSE I KNOW
THEY DO WANT TO DO THE DEAL,

42:06.259 --> 42:08.862
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO,
YOU KNOW, LIKE,

42:08.895 --> 42:11.064
A $2 MILLION
INSURANCE POLICY.

42:20.073 --> 42:21.307
- OKAY.

42:21.341 --> 42:23.710
WHOO.

42:23.743 --> 42:28.114
SO I THINK I CAN GET HIM TO 23.
- THAT'S BETTER.

42:28.148 --> 42:30.750
THAT'S, I THINK,
SOMETHING THAT TOM WILL ACCEPT.

42:30.784 --> 42:33.186
- BUT HE WANTS YOU
TO PAY THE INSURANCE POLICY.

42:33.219 --> 42:34.788
- COME ON, WE'RE NOT GONNA PAY
THE INSURANCE ON THAT.

42:34.821 --> 42:38.091
WE DON'T KNOW--
KNOW WHAT SORT OF GUY THIS IS.

42:38.091 --> 42:39.592
HE'S GOTTA
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

42:39.626 --> 42:40.927
- BUT HE'S NOT
GONNA PAY IT.

42:40.960 --> 42:42.362
HE WANTS YOU TO PAY IT.

42:42.395 --> 42:44.397
- IT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT FOR THE INSURANCE.

42:44.431 --> 42:48.101
I THINK IT'S--
IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH SELL.

42:48.101 --> 42:50.136
- I KNOW IT'S NOT
AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT,

42:50.170 --> 42:52.939
BUT IT'S REALLY--
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH MONEY.

42:52.972 --> 42:55.408
AND I THINK THAT
SINCE YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL...

42:55.442 --> 42:57.911
- MM-HMM.
- IF WE'RE GOING TO RENT IT,

42:57.944 --> 43:00.747
WE'RE GONNA RUN INTO
THIS PROBLEM EVERY TIME.

43:00.780 --> 43:03.717
YOU COVER THE INSURANCE POLICY,
IT'S NO MONEY AT ALL,

43:03.750 --> 43:06.486
AND EVERYONE'S HAPPY, OR,
YOU KNOW,

43:06.519 --> 43:07.620
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

43:07.654 --> 43:08.822
THAT YOU STORE
ALL THE ART?

43:08.855 --> 43:10.623
IMAGINE WHAT
STORING THE ART'S GONNA COST.

43:10.657 --> 43:12.392
AND HE'S WILLING TO PAY
THE FULL YEAR, UP FRONT,

43:12.425 --> 43:14.728
AND HE'S A SINGLE GUY
BY HIMSELF.

43:14.761 --> 43:17.197
HE'S PROBABLY GONNA COME HOME
AND READ EVERY DAY.

43:17.230 --> 43:19.132
- IT'S A GREAT LIBRARY.

43:19.165 --> 43:22.802
- IT IS A GOOD LIBRARY.

43:26.639 --> 43:28.475
- ALL RIGHT,
I THINK WE GOT A DEAL.

43:28.508 --> 43:30.076
- AWESOME.

43:30.110 --> 43:31.077
GOOD DEAL.

43:31.111 --> 43:33.980
- TOOK
A LITTLE CONVINCING.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.515
- BUT LOOK--
- BUT IT'S A GOOD DEAL.

43:35.548 --> 43:37.450
WE COULD DO WORSE.
- YOU COULD DO WORSE.

43:37.484 --> 43:38.585
- ALL RIGHT.
- THANKS A LOT.

43:38.618 --> 43:40.453
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS, CHRISTIAN.

43:47.293 --> 43:48.795

CLIENTS I'VE EVER HAD.
