WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:02.330
Previously on "brothers & sisters"...

00:02.370 --> 00:06.850
we just need to,you know,knock
out these two little wall things.

00:08.109 --> 00:11.450
and you're gonna get an
architect and a contractor.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.300
Is robert really gonna make
you quit if you publish?

00:13.310 --> 00:15.250
Well,yeah. And I happen
to agree with him,mother.

00:15.260 --> 00:19.010
I mean,I-I certainly can't work with
people that I wrote a book about.

00:19.030 --> 00:22.510
I'd like you to consider replacing
kitty as my communications director.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.050
Welcome to politics.

00:24.070 --> 00:25.320
I'm seeing someone.

00:25.340 --> 00:26.670
If you tell anyone,I'll
never forgive you.

00:26.690 --> 00:27.860
I cross my heart.

00:27.900 --> 00:28.820
- She's so pale.
- Oh,god.

00:28.830 --> 00:30.680
We have to take her to E.R.,Okay?

00:30.690 --> 00:32.409
She's going to need a transplant.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.030
I'm not her biological father.

00:34.050 --> 00:36.360
One of my brothers is the donor.

00:36.380 --> 00:37.470
We don't know which one.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.440
Kevin,it's you.

00:46.420 --> 00:49.640
hello? Hello?

00:53.930 --> 00:57.390
oh,you're here.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.660
what's for dinner?

01:00.680 --> 01:03.990
I told you... liver.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.610
- Oh,sweet.
- my favorite.

01:05.620 --> 01:08.180
Guys,did you hear that?

01:09.080 --> 01:11.460
the baby?

01:14.870 --> 01:17.710
hey,sleepyhead.

01:17.740 --> 01:20.100
How are you feeling?

01:20.120 --> 01:22.320
- A little hot. -
Well,you look great--

01:22.330 --> 01:28.360
all shiny and mussy,like a wounded world war
ii soldier in a bombed-out french catheal.

01:28.370 --> 01:31.500
Male nurse,wounded soldier-- it's
always kind of been a fantasy of mine.

01:31.510 --> 01:33.920
- Good. He's up.
- Yep,he sure is.

01:33.930 --> 01:38.560
Look at you,sweetie. My goodness.
You're drenched in sweat. Honey.

01:38.570 --> 01:41.250
Let me take your temperature.

01:41.260 --> 01:42.340
Does he know where he is?

01:42.390 --> 01:46.220
Yeah. I'm in my childhood bedroom with my mother
and husband talking about me as if I weren't here.

01:46.230 --> 01:48.560
Yeah,good. It's normal. Kev.

01:48.570 --> 01:51.410
- Yeah.
- Here we go. Let's do this again. All right?

01:51.420 --> 01:54.610
- Why are you here? - Oh,no.
Please,please.Not the questions--

01:54.620 --> 01:57.370
the doctor said,with liver donors, you
have to look out for mental disorientation.

01:57.380 --> 02:01.210
Fine. I am here because I gave
part of my liver to elizabh.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.020
- Who's elizabeth?
- She's my niece.

02:03.030 --> 02:06.520
And,well,technically,she's my daughter
'cause I gave sperm to tommy and julia.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.470
- I--do we have to do this now?
- All right,all right. Okay.

02:08.479 --> 02:10.699
- Seems like kevin.
- Yes. Fine,fine,fine.

02:10.710 --> 02:12.410
But look at this. My god,scotty.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.260
You have every blanket
in the house on him.

02:14.290 --> 02:16.750
Oh,yeah. Well,I just thought that we
should try and keep him as warm as pos--

02:16.760 --> 02:20.590
and now we have to change the
sheets because they're soaked.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.760
But that's okay. It's
fine. For goodness sakes.

02:22.770 --> 02:26.070
We have to get him hydrated. We
need to get more fluids into him.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.610
- I'll go get him a drink.
- Freeze.

02:27.620 --> 02:31.020
I'd like you to go to the linen
cupboard and get a fresh set of sheets.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.020
I want theream ones,not
the striped ones.

02:33.030 --> 02:37.170
And I'll get him something to drink
because I have to get his pills anyway.

02:37.180 --> 02:40.570
- Whatever works.
- And if you want anything,just speak out because I,uh,

02:40.580 --> 02:44.730
I put the baby monitor in last
night. I can hear everything you say.

02:44.740 --> 02:48.210
French cathedral,huh? Yeah.

02:50.570 --> 02:53.190
Hello. Hey,mom.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.000
Hi,kitty. Robert,hi.

02:55.010 --> 02:57.920
We just,uh,came to check on the patient.

02:57.950 --> 02:59.580
- Yeah,how's he doing?
- Great,great.

02:59.590 --> 03:04.940
Although he did just wake up from a nap scotty
had just put way too many blankets on him.

03:04.960 --> 03:08.240
Rookie mistake. So go
on up. He's wide-awake.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.730
Oh,oh,oh,robert.

03:09.750 --> 03:13.400
Uh,the doctor did say he wanted him
to have as little stress as possible.

03:13.420 --> 03:17.470
No,I'm here to visit my brother-in-law
not my communications director.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.530
Thank you.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.010
Look at the way he
places the windows,right?

03:21.040 --> 03:24.780
So that the sunlight comes streaming in
and then it reflects right off that stone.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.190
It's just absolutely inspired.

03:27.210 --> 03:30.380
So why is a guy who's designed
that helping with mom's pet project?

03:30.420 --> 03:31.740
There's nothing pet about it.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.300
Berkeley goldschmidt staked
$2 million in my foundation.

03:35.330 --> 03:40.420
And every architect knows when a city is looking
to build their next louvre or olympic stadium,

03:40.440 --> 03:43.960
charitable projects like mine
look very good on their résuméS.

03:44.010 --> 03:47.050
- I found them... Hanging on your curtain rod.
- Awesome.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.200
What's with the chest
candy? What's the occasion?

03:49.210 --> 03:50.850
He's cooper's
show-and-tell.

03:50.870 --> 03:52.820
You're looking at the person
my nephew admires most.

03:52.850 --> 03:54.510
He's presenting me to his class today.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.000
He's a hero,like his brother upstairs.

03:57.050 --> 04:01.190
Well,I don't want to be late for
first grade,so,uh,I'll smell you later.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.930
- Bye,honey.
- Well,I have great news.

04:02.940 --> 04:05.210
- What?
- I found you your architect. He's gonna be great.

04:05.220 --> 04:07.670
He just did the art
museum over on grand.

04:07.690 --> 04:08.370
Who is he?

04:08.400 --> 04:09.770
You have an appointment with him today.

04:09.780 --> 04:10.500
How'd you find him?

04:10.530 --> 04:14.090
You remember the young guy
who did the ojai building?

04:15.290 --> 04:17.440
No. I'm not hiring roger grant.

04:17.450 --> 04:20.779
What are you talking about? You
haven't seen the man in 30 years.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.150
Oh,my. How time flies.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.560
Look at this cute little
thing I got for elizabeth.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.580
It plays music. It'll keep her
quiet until she gets better.

04:26.590 --> 04:28.550
Okay,nora,this guy is big-time now.

04:28.580 --> 04:29.570
He works out of london.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.120
He has an office in L.A.

04:31.150 --> 04:35.870
He's a huge get,and you have
to admit,he's aged very well.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.200
- He's kinda cute,huh?
- No. Absolutely not.

04:38.210 --> 04:40.430
I don't understand this.I
finally find you an architect--

04:40.440 --> 04:42.680
somebody who's talented
and someone we know--

04:42.710 --> 04:44.350
that's just it. I know
him. I don't like him.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.610
Mom,didn't you hear u we've
been screaming into the monitor.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.290
Kevin wants an orange popsicle.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.490
Oh,I'm sorry. I turned it off 'cause I
couldn't stand the sound of the static.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.180
- Oh,for god sakes.
- I'm sorry.

04:54.190 --> 04:56.520
so then who's on point
in espinoza's office?

04:56.560 --> 04:59.680
- Espinoza?
- YeS. He's the chair of the appropriations committee.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.480
My husband is unbelievable.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.050
I really don't appreciate you hitting
me up for intel when I'm on bed rest.

05:04.060 --> 05:06.630
Okay,what am I supposed to do
about the appointment today?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.260
Cancel it.

05:08.270 --> 05:10.600
So we have no idea what
espinoza's provisions are?

05:10.610 --> 05:12.210
His office
dodged my calls--

05:12.220 --> 05:14.210
No,no,no. No,no. No,no more of that.

05:14.220 --> 05:18.150
- No,no.I was just having-- - no,I-I know what
you were doing. The place isugged,remember?

05:18.160 --> 05:21.050
I just need some info on
this immigration bill.I'm--

05:21.060 --> 05:23.730
robert,please. Can you please
move away from the patient?

05:23.740 --> 05:24.960
Kevin is off the clock.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.960
I'm not suggesting he suit
up and come into the office,

05:26.980 --> 05:29.670
but,you know,maybe a call so I
know what the hell I'm voting on.

05:29.710 --> 05:31.830
- Look,you know what?You're not
gonna-- - could I get a napkin,please?

05:31.840 --> 05:34.390
Uh,yeah. You're not gonna get
what you need from espinoza.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.670
You know--you know what you should
do? You should call,um,dan bicks.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.760
Dan bicks is an imbecile.

05:38.770 --> 05:39.650
Well,yeah,he's an imbecile,

05:39.660 --> 05:43.450
but he has an assistant named
yelena who has a sister named lauren

05:43.470 --> 05:46.400
who is dating espinoza's
legislative correspondent.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.850
I don't even know,maybe--
maybe for a year or something.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.740
You know,that--that is
definitely what you need to do.

05:50.780 --> 05:54.330
You should call yelena,and I bet
you she can get you what you need.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.950
You know what? I'll do it.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.310
Good,'cause the vote's in two
days,and I need to be briefed.

05:58.330 --> 06:01.420
Okay,I'll brief you. Until
he recovers,I will be kevin.

06:01.430 --> 06:02.480
Okay. Do you have time?

06:02.490 --> 06:06.070
Because you're starting your book
promotion and you're gonna be on "the view."

06:06.570 --> 06:09.370
No,I-I can be kevin for a week.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.900
Hey,kev. Do you mind?

06:11.910 --> 06:14.220
Oh,sorry.

06:15.120 --> 06:19.520
The person I admire most in the
world is my uncle,justin walker.

06:20.090 --> 06:22.320
Hello.

06:23.100 --> 06:27.230
well,uh,why don't you tell us
why you admire your uncle so much?

06:28.790 --> 06:33.340
he was a doctor in the army. And
he went to,um... where'd you go?

06:33.350 --> 06:37.040
I w--I went to,uh,I-iraq
and afghanistan.

06:37.050 --> 06:39.050
Iraq and aganistan.

06:39.070 --> 06:44.160
I don't know where that is,but my mom and
everyone was really happy when he came home.

06:44.170 --> 06:47.780
And what's really cool is
justin gets to live with s mom.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.020
And he doesn't even have a job.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.530
- And he doesn't have to go to school or anything.
- Okay.

06:52.540 --> 06:56.230
He gets to hang out and
play video games all day.

06:56.240 --> 07:00.560
Okay. okay. Hey,guys.

07:00.570 --> 07:04.170
Oh,tell 'em how you defeated
the piranha plant as mini mario.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.380

- No.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.990
He's not allowed to drink that.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.750
You said he needed fluids.You said he needed fluids. He's
not allowed to drink that. He's not allowed to drink that.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.330
You told me he needed fluids.

Advertise your product or brand here

07:57.400 --> 08:00.370
okay. Well,you're not
backing this immigration bill.

08:00.380 --> 08:05.050
Oh,did you talk to jane who spoke
to kate who's engaged to steve?

08:05.090 --> 08:08.300
No. Actually,I talked with yelena who
talked to lauren who's engaged to joe.

08:08.310 --> 08:10.860
But I did get you what you
want,and you're not supporting it.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.340
Well,that's not exactly your call.

08:13.370 --> 08:18.320
Well,espinoza's added a whole section that completely
stretches the terms of due process for arrested illegals.

08:18.350 --> 08:21.330
Yes,well,there's
something else going on.

08:21.340 --> 08:24.970
Espinoza has got my back
on the landsman bill,

08:24.990 --> 08:28.310
and he's bringing johnson
and lyle and marshall.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.980
Okay. Well,you are just gonna
have to get those votes elsewhere,

08:30.990 --> 08:34.919
- because funding joint U.S.-Mexican smuggling
patrols-- - and offsetting 50% of the cost.

08:34.929 --> 08:37.730
Okay. Well,why don't we just send the
ney right down to the drug cartels?

08:37.740 --> 08:39.230
Or do you want to talk
about his other program?

08:39.250 --> 08:41.590
The temporary guest-worker
program? It's amnesty.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.690
You mean the one that feeds the labor
force that drives the california economy?

08:44.710 --> 08:49.310
Oh,please. It's an open-ended
policy that just drives down wages.

08:54.470 --> 08:57.360
- I've missed this.
- Me,too.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.010
So what are we gonna
tell her when she's older?

09:09.040 --> 09:13.060
The truth-- that she was a preemie
and that her liver wasn't working,

09:13.100 --> 09:15.840
and she needed a piece
of a new one,right?

09:15.850 --> 09:17.800
And what about your brother?

09:17.820 --> 09:19.590
How are we gonna handle that?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.190
What's to handle? He'll
always be uncle kev.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.510
That's the end of the story.

09:23.550 --> 09:27.680
Yeah,he'll--he'll always
be her uncle,but,tommy...

09:28.070 --> 09:32.760
I-I keep thinking about that day when she's
6,and we're at your mom's house swimming,

09:32.770 --> 09:37.940
and she notices she has the same scar as
kevin,or god forbid someone let something slip.

09:37.970 --> 09:43.510
I just know she's gonna have questions,and
I want to know what our answers are gonnbe.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.850
I know. Look,come
here. Let's enjoy this.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.760
Just the three ous,ay?

09:50.770 --> 09:54.200
- Right?
- okay.

09:57.140 --> 09:59.060
Your mother will think I'm hurting you.

09:59.070 --> 10:01.030
You are. And don't worry.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.930
I yanked the plug on that
monitor like an hour ago.

10:04.330 --> 10:07.020
remind me why we're here and
not in our nice apartment.

10:07.050 --> 10:09.690
because your mother
offered,and you accepted.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.100
- I did?
- Yes.

10:12.110 --> 10:14.640
You have to admit,she does have
the phd in tending to us kids.

10:14.650 --> 10:16.280
Yeah,which she won't let
me forget. You know what?

10:16.290 --> 10:18.890
I bet you 20 bucks she comments
on how I'm dressing your wound.

10:18.900 --> 10:22.460
Scotty,I didn't know you
were gonna change the bandage.

10:22.470 --> 10:25.110
Oh,you've got so much ointment on there.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.880
The tape is never gonna stick.

10:26.900 --> 10:30.090
Well,it seems pretty
secure to me. cha-ching.

10:30.100 --> 10:34.520
You know what? It doesn't really matter because we're
gonna have to redo it all anyway after the shower.

10:34.530 --> 10:35.240
What shower?

10:35.250 --> 10:37.610
The doctor says you get to take
a shower today. Let's get him up.

10:37.620 --> 10:40.390
- I really don't feel like taking a shower right now.
- It'll make you feel clean and refreshed.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.580
Yeah,I know what a shower is. I
just don't feel like taking one.

10:42.590 --> 10:45.000
- Y--just take his shirt off. - You know--
you know what? I'll-- I'll get it,nora.

10:45.010 --> 10:47.360
- No,no,no,no.
- don't lift his arm up like that,scotty.

10:47.370 --> 10:50.670
- Okay,I'm sorry.
- You have to put your hand in here,you know,like that.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.140
- Please.
- Lift your butt up.

10:52.150 --> 10:55.830
I'll take your pants off. Lift your
butt up. Lift it up. Come on. Come on.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.600
You know what,nora? Why don't you
start the shower? I'll get the pants.

10:58.610 --> 11:00.970
Scotty,don't be silly. It's
nothing I haven't seen before.

11:00.980 --> 11:03.160
Well,hopefully it's something that
you haven't seen in a long time.

11:03.180 --> 11:05.820
- I'll close my eyes. -
s-stop,stop. Both of you.

11:05.830 --> 11:09.020
- The doctor wants you to take a shower.
- I don't care what the doctor said.

11:09.030 --> 11:12.540
I just want the two of you
to leave me alone right now.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.310
- Okay-- -
right now.

11:17.660 --> 11:20.580
The pain pills make him so grumpy.

11:21.010 --> 11:24.160
Yeah,it's the pain pills.

11:38.700 --> 11:39.950
is ihot here?

11:39.970 --> 11:43.460
Not really. But it could be.

11:56.530 --> 11:59.100
oh,my god. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

11:59.110 --> 12:02.140
I-I was just coming to
see how you were doing?

12:02.160 --> 12:03.860
were you having a bad dream about me?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.660
Hmm? Uh,no. N no. Why,uh,why?

12:06.670 --> 12:07.740
You said my name.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.840
No,I didn'T. What?
Uh,well,y-yeah. Yeah,yeah.

12:10.850 --> 12:14.900
Yeah,I did,'cause,uh,I-I-I saw
you because you--you were here.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.220
- You're lying.
- I heard a scream.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.860
- Kevin had a bad dream.
- No,I didn'T.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.540
It's still nap time.
What are you doing up?

12:19.550 --> 12:21.910
You know what? I'm gonna
take that shower now.

12:22.250 --> 12:24.510
- I thought you didn't want a shower.
- I didn'T. Now I do.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.010
- Here,let me help.
- No,I'm fine.

12:26.020 --> 12:28.030
Thank you so much,both of you.

12:28.050 --> 12:32.260
I'm just gonna take a-- I'll be fine.
Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry about me.

12:32.570 --> 12:34.700
I'll
be fi--

12:40.390 --> 12:44.390
Ah,yeah. That-- that was...
that was nice,doing that again.

12:45.020 --> 12:46.550
Again?

12:46.560 --> 12:49.950
I-I ink you must be confusing
me with a former boss,

12:49.970 --> 12:53.720
because I don't recall us ever
having sex in the office before.

12:53.730 --> 12:56.880
I was talking about
the part before the sex.

12:56.890 --> 12:59.450
Oh,discussing immigration reform.

12:59.470 --> 13:02.410
Well--well,not the--the
topic,but the--the spirited--

13:02.430 --> 13:03.410
exchange of ideas...

13:03.420 --> 13:04.500
verbal wrangling...

13:04.530 --> 13:05.940
fervent cogitation...

13:05.950 --> 13:07.800
brain sex.

13:07.810 --> 13:11.460
Brain sex. I like it.

13:12.350 --> 13:15.960
You know,you're right.
It has been a long time.

13:15.970 --> 13:18.930
Probably since I worked here.

13:18.940 --> 13:20.560
You know,I should just fire kevin.

13:20.570 --> 13:21.980
Oh,yeah. Now-- now
that's a good idea.

13:21.990 --> 13:24.690
- You know what? You should get right on that.
- I'm serious.

13:24.700 --> 13:27.290
Robert,you can't hire me
just so you can have more sex.

13:27.320 --> 13:32.400
Okay,but how about because you're qualified,you
know the ropes,and I can have more sex--

13:32.420 --> 13:35.450
- cerebral and otherwise? - Right.
And--and what-- what about the book?

13:35.460 --> 13:37.990
You know,the book,e reason
that I don't work here anymore?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.470
It's been four months. People will
say you got your wrist slapped.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.220
Robert,we're having a baby.

13:42.230 --> 13:43.430
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

13:43.450 --> 13:45.640
This is crazy. It's--I
mean,what if it doesn't work?

13:45.650 --> 13:48.430
- Eh,I've fired you before.
- True.

13:55.970 --> 13:59.420
Hi,janet. How are yo

14:03.160 --> 14:05.460
hey,justin. What happened to you?

14:05.470 --> 14:12.060
Coop and I stayed around looking for
you,but,uh,you obviously went somewhere.

14:12.070 --> 14:18.260
Um,listen,I hope that you didn't freak
out about,you know,what coop said about...

14:18.270 --> 14:21.510
you living with mom and playing
video games all day,because...

14:21.530 --> 14:25.050
you-- I mean,you know coop.
He was playing to his audience.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.640
And,um,oh,oh,you're gonna love this.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.400
Ms.Mitchell asked about you.

14:30.420 --> 14:33.990
Yeah. I mean,I-I told her that
you were,you know,taken,but,um,

14:34.600 --> 14:40.630
I thought you would be
flattered,uh,to hear that she,uh...

14:40.900 --> 14:42.560
I-I am a terrible liar,justin.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.920
Uh,I know you're somewhere
feeling humiliated.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.080
It was very painful to
watch,so I can't imagine...

14:49.100 --> 14:51.210
how it felt for you.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.730
I'm worried about you. Call me.

14:57.050 --> 14:59.600
shoot. Coming.

15:01.110 --> 15:03.630
yes,it works.

15:06.790 --> 15:09.280
Nora walker.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.680
Roger.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.740
The years have been good to
you,nora. You look wonderful.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.320
I come bearing gifts.

15:17.330 --> 15:20.700
A gift? For me? About you?

15:20.710 --> 15:23.360
I knew you'd call. I just didn't
think it would take 30 years.

15:23.370 --> 15:26.050
Why are you here? I-I thought
that meeting got canceled.

15:26.060 --> 15:28.390
Is that roger? Roger.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.750
How are you?

15:29.780 --> 15:32.550
- Oh,it's good to see you.
- It's good to see you,too,saul.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.470
- Don't you look well?
- Thank you.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.790
According to nora,there's
been some misunderstanding.

15:37.820 --> 15:39.600
Yes,apparently there has been.

15:39.610 --> 15:42.500
Well,no. I just wanted to get roger's
take on the project. That's all.

15:42.510 --> 15:43.760
Well,then fine. You two go ahead.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.930
I have a son upstairs
who needs his lunch.

15:45.950 --> 15:47.490
I'd put a ld on that.

15:47.500 --> 15:50.550
Kevin's decided to take a shower. So...

15:50.560 --> 15:52.200
- hi,I'm scotty.
- Roger grant. Nice to meet you.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.230
Nice to meet you.

15:53.260 --> 15:56.210
Oh,you know,I'll take that
to the kitchen for you.

15:56.220 --> 15:59.680
Well,it looks like you're
available to join us.

16:00.110 --> 16:02.390
- Good to see you.
- Great.

16:14.060 --> 16:19.200
justin. Justin.
Jus-justin.Ju--

16:20.820 --> 16:22.710
open...

16:22.720 --> 16:26.640
uh,does mom know you're wandering
around like an escaped mental patient?

16:26.660 --> 16:28.160
Are you coming or going?

16:28.190 --> 16:30.700
- I'm going nowhere,dude.
- Goodyou can give me a ride. Let's go.

16:30.710 --> 16:31.850
Kevin,aren'you supposed to be in bed?

16:31.860 --> 16:34.140
I cannot take it anymore,okay?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.290
I have to get outta here.

16:35.310 --> 16:36.660
Wh about yo nurses up there?

16:36.670 --> 16:38.420
They think I'm taking
a shower. Let's go.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.120
That's your plan--turn on
the water and then take off?

16:41.140 --> 16:42.820
I didn't turn it on.

16:42.850 --> 16:45.560
Well,please tell me you
locked the bathroom door.

16:45.590 --> 16:46.900
Oh,my gosh,kevin. This
is like amateur hour.

16:46.910 --> 16:48.520
No wonder why you didn't
have a life in high school.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.780
Can you just shut up and drive?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.680
Kevin,I can'T. All right,man?
You just had surgery.

16:51.690 --> 16:52.790
Li,in good
conscience,I can't--

16:52.800 --> 16:54.570
whoa,whoa,spare me the
hippocratic oath,okay?

16:54.580 --> 16:57.210
If your sperm got there first,this
would've been you,remember? Let's go.

16:57.220 --> 16:59.290
Well,you have your pills,right?

16:59.320 --> 17:03.830
You don't have your-- I hate you.
At least I'm good for mething.

17:05.470 --> 17:08.089
- and another skyscraper.
- Look at that.

17:08.099 --> 17:10.569
It's amazing. It's a
concert of color and light.

17:10.579 --> 17:13.109
It's-- it's--it's
heart-stopping,roger.

17:13.140 --> 17:15.760
It's just-- it's
such beautiful work.

17:15.770 --> 17:17.750
Thank you.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.050
What is that?

17:19.069 --> 17:20.819
That's an obelisk.

17:20.829 --> 17:23.030
An obelisk.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.040
justin.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.400
How was it having all those
little kids look up to you?

17:28.420 --> 17:31.850
It was,uh,it was
amazing. I'm gonna--I...

17:33.030 --> 17:35.830
- I thou st youron was in the shower.
- Her other son.

17:36.580 --> 17:40.740
So all of your children are
still living at home? Interesting.

17:40.750 --> 17:45.860
No,not all of them,and not
interesting,and not any of your business.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.030
okay.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.100
Bathroom.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.460
I'm gonna kill him. Pills...

18:34.890 --> 18:36.900
Uh,I was checking on our boy in there.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.150
- Yeah. Still grumpy?
- Yeah. He's the worst.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.530
I mean-- but--but don't
take it personally.

18:40.540 --> 18:43.040
I mean,he's always been sort
of a terrible patient,you know?

18:43.050 --> 18:45.630
He had chicken pox,and it
was like code red inhis house.

18:45.650 --> 18:48.870
I can take these.
Just,uh,yeah,don't worry.

18:53.010 --> 18:55.410
a-are you looking for something?

18:55.440 --> 18:58.730
Yeah. Uh,yeah. My trumpet. Here it is.

18:58.740 --> 19:00.760
- Oh,you play?
- Uh,no.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.690
- But you played growing up?
- No.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.210
Uh,you know,I-I wouldn't go in there.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.930
I mean,he--you know,he
needs some space.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.900
He's in-- he in his mood,you
know? Good to see you.

19:09.910 --> 19:12.150
Bye.

19:13.810 --> 19:16.490
- nora,come on. - I--yeah,I
am listening. I am listening.

19:16.500 --> 19:21.010
I'm going to go in here now. I just have
to heat up my son's lunch. I will be back.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.220
For god sakes,I don't know why the two of
them just don't shack up and get it over with.

19:26.240 --> 19:29.750
I can't believe I have to sit there
and listen to this pompous nonsense

19:29.760 --> 19:32.820
just because saul wants a boyfriend.

19:33.750 --> 19:34.350
What?

19:34.360 --> 19:36.530
Mom--mom,you--you--you...

19:36.560 --> 19:38.470
you're actually way off base about saul.

19:38.490 --> 19:42.450
Oh,really? Well,you should see him
in there,fawning all over roger.

19:42.460 --> 19:44.550
Mom,I have something to
tell you. It's gossip.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.770
I just need you to make sure saul's
not coming in here. it's about him.

19:50.980 --> 19:53.480
A what? What? What? What?

19:53.490 --> 19:56.020
Uh,saul's got a boyfriend.

19:56.050 --> 19:57.520
He told me a couple weeks ago.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.040
Well,why didn't he tell me?

19:59.060 --> 20:00.170
I don't know. I don't have any details.

20:00.180 --> 20:02.210
- But listen,you-- you cannot
tell saul. - No,I won'T.

20:02.220 --> 20:03.100
- Okay,he told me on the Q.T.
- I won'T.

20:03.110 --> 20:04.780
And we're gonna keep it on the
down low as the kids say,all right?

20:04.790 --> 20:09.620
I won'T. I promise. I promise,I
won'T. I love you. Yeah.

20:13.460 --> 20:16.090
Why is there a trumpet in here?

20:20.960 --> 20:22.340
Take longer next time.

20:22.370 --> 20:26.150
You can't ask me to be your getaway
driver and then bitch about it. Here.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.630
Where's the other one? There's two.

20:27.640 --> 20:28.710
I just saw the one in the kitchen.

20:28.730 --> 20:31.010
Well,this is the antibiotic.
I need the painkillers.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.530
All right,well,you know what?This
one wl keep you from going septic

20:33.540 --> 20:35.730
unless you want to go back
in the house,then man up.

20:35.740 --> 20:38.850
I'm not going back in there.

20:40.650 --> 20:43.200
- What's your problem?
- What's not?

20:46.100 --> 20:48.830
Nora walker,what are you doing?

20:48.840 --> 20:51.100
What does it look like I'm doing?

20:51.110 --> 20:56.830
I am making a liver-friendly,high-carb,low-protein
snack for my darling son.

20:56.860 --> 20:58.840
Nora,roger is out there waiting for you.

20:58.860 --> 21:03.470
I am no way,no how,never,ever going
to hire roger grant for this project.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.570
What about I donate services?

21:05.580 --> 21:07.180
I think it's a tremendous project.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.670
Well,thank you so much,but
I'm really not a charity case.

21:09.690 --> 21:11.980
I'm sorry. What have i do to offend you?

21:11.990 --> 21:15.000
We haven't seen each other
for 30 years,and somehow...

21:15.320 --> 21:18.500
uh,this is not about what happened
at that tacky luau party,now is it?

21:18.510 --> 21:20.210
because it's nothing
to be embaabassed out.

21:20.220 --> 21:21.490
- Absolutely not.
- What happened at the luau?

21:21.500 --> 21:22.800
your sister hit on me.

21:22.810 --> 21:25.150
I most certainly did not.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.780
Roger,this project calls
for someone to create a warm

21:28.800 --> 21:30.870
- and nurturing environment where
families can ce in and-- - right.

21:30.880 --> 21:35.470
You want to build a
womb,like this home--

21:35.480 --> 21:38.550
maternal space incapable
of expending its progeny.

21:38.570 --> 21:39.210
Oh,dear.

21:39.220 --> 21:42.590
my progeny are here by choice.

21:42.610 --> 21:45.040
I'm not holding them hostage.

21:45.050 --> 21:46.290
Kevin escaped.

21:46.310 --> 21:49.240
He left a note,but it
doesn't say where he went.

21:50.120 --> 21:54.130
So the,uh,cycle of life continues.

22:00.260 --> 22:02.380
I hope you enjoy those $20 nuts.

22:02.420 --> 22:05.660
Yeah,well,I'm not the one who checked
into the nicest room on the beach.

22:05.690 --> 22:07.260
So much for crying poor these days.

22:07.270 --> 22:09.680
You know what? I gave up part of
my liver. I think I've earned it.

22:09.690 --> 22:14.230
Hi,yeah. I just wanted to know if I have a refill
left or whether or not I have to call my doctor.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.520
Walker,kevin.

22:15.550 --> 22:17.540
Kevin,I can't pick up
your pills,not today.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.640
- I'm not asking you to.
- Yeah,great.

22:19.650 --> 22:22.070
And--and what
time do you close?

22:22.080 --> 22:24.340
Okay,thank you.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.670
if that's mom again,just
tell her we're okay,all right?

22:26.680 --> 22:27.880
She's not gonna come after you.

22:27.890 --> 22:29.930
I think I can handle this.

22:29.940 --> 22:32.070
There you are. Are you with justin?

22:32.080 --> 22:33.400
Maybe. Why?What's u

22:33.410 --> 22:36.420
mom said you fled the premises,and
given your recent surgery,

22:36.440 --> 22:38.800
I figured you must have had some help.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.770
Aren't you a regular nancy drew?

22:40.780 --> 22:42.410
Well,does he seem okay to you?

22:42.420 --> 22:44.120
Yeah. A little crabby,maybe. Why?

22:44.130 --> 22:46.360
He had disastrous morning.

22:46.380 --> 22:49.870
He was painted a total loser
by a class of first graders.

22:49.900 --> 22:50.960
I wish that seemed weirder.

22:50.990 --> 22:52.410
So where are you guys?

22:52.430 --> 22:55.130
That's top secret. But
don't worry.I am fi--

22:55.140 --> 22:58.370
actually,I'm in excruciating pain.

22:58.380 --> 22:59.890
But you could help me.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.080
This is about justin.
We have to talk to him.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.790
He's been humiliated. He's vulnerable.

23:03.800 --> 23:08.000
This is a perfect moment for us to put our collective
foot in his ass about getting his act together.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.830
Okay,great. I'm in. I think
that's a brilliant idea.

23:09.840 --> 23:13.890
But before I tell you where we are,do
you know that new pharmacy on colorado?

23:13.910 --> 23:15.960
What do you want?

23:15.970 --> 23:19.400
So,kitty,tell us how you
got interested in politics.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.730
Right,right. Well,that--that
is-- that--that's actually,um,

23:22.740 --> 23:28.520
a very,very funny
story,and...uh,snooze-a-roo.

23:28.530 --> 23:30.060
See--see,I ca--
I can't do this.

23:30.090 --> 23:34.160
I mean,I can blabber on and on about policy,but
when it comes to talking about my life--

23:34.180 --> 23:37.450
just say you got into politics
because you thought reagan was cute.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.490
Okay,that is a good
one. That is a good one.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.400
What's going on in here?

23:40.420 --> 23:43.330
Honey,hi. We're just doing a
mock interview for "the view."

23:43.340 --> 23:45.330
I'm barbara walters.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.160
of course you are.

23:47.170 --> 23:49.660
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

23:52.010 --> 23:53.890
This is highly un-kevin of you.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.120
Well,I'm taking a break.

23:55.130 --> 23:59.100
I'm being kitty,and I have to come up
with some very funny personal anecdotes,

23:59.140 --> 24:03.220
you know,in case,um,whoopi
wants to ask me a question.

24:03.230 --> 24:06.200
I have a question. When am i getting
my espinoza briefing? I need tprep.

24:06.210 --> 24:07.560
Well,so do I. Show's tomorrow.

24:07.570 --> 24:08.370
Committee's tomorrow.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.010
- Do you want brain sex or not?
- Yes,I do.

24:10.020 --> 24:12.830
Well,then this is part of
the deal. Now don't worry.

24:12.840 --> 24:16.920
I will brief you,but right now,I've
gotta come up with a few more anecdotes.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.410
you don't suppose that's mom,do you?

24:23.420 --> 24:26.440
No. It's probably
housekeeping. Go check.

24:28.010 --> 24:30.120
yes,ma'am.

24:32.550 --> 24:33.530
tommy.

24:33.550 --> 24:35.980
I brought reinforcements.

24:36.450 --> 24:39.000
Nice,uh,five-star retreat.

24:39.340 --> 24:40.460
Thanks. How's elizabeth?

24:40.470 --> 24:43.180
- She's,uh,she's good.
- Good.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.070
- So have I been disowned?
- Yeah,by me.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.990
Thanks for letting me be the one to
tell mom that she was suffocating you.

24:49.000 --> 24:49.970
Appreciate that.

24:49.980 --> 24:54.020
Mom sent the cavalry. You
must be,uh,in deep trouble.

24:56.510 --> 24:59.740
- Actually,we're here for you.
- What?

24:59.750 --> 25:03.340
Those,uh,first graders,they
can be pretty tough.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.350
You told him. Thank you,sarah.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.110
Yeah,and thank you
for returning my calls.

25:07.120 --> 25:12.590
You know,the two of you have a very unique way of
expressing your love for the people who care about you.

25:12.620 --> 25:15.140
Look,it's no big deal,all
right? It's a bunch of kids.

25:15.150 --> 25:17.200
You seemed pretty upset to me.

25:17.220 --> 25:20.400
So what? Coop said it like it
is. I mean,I'm a-- I he lifE.

25:20.410 --> 25:22.820
Well,you can always get a
job tomorrow if you wantne.

25:22.860 --> 25:24.950
What,are you gonna hire
me,sorting avocados?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.580
Oh,I-I have an idea. Maybe i
could be rebecca's secretary.

25:27.590 --> 25:29.550
- Justin,you're in a rut.
- Yeah.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.090
I mean,seriously,what do you see
yourself doing like 10,20 years from now?

25:32.130 --> 25:34.700
I don't know. If I knew,I'd
be doing it,all right?

25:34.710 --> 25:38.500
Guys,seriously,what is
this,like,a career intervention?

25:40.340 --> 25:43.330
Look,justin,there's nothing
wrong with not having that,

25:43.370 --> 25:45.560
you know,long-term
plan per se--

25:45.590 --> 25:47.110
but playing "super mario bros."

25:47.120 --> 25:49.600
All day long probably
shouldn't be yo life goal.

25:49.610 --> 25:52.330
You know what?I,uh,I really appreciate
what you guys are trying to do,

25:52.340 --> 25:53.730
but I'm not in the mood,okay?

25:53.760 --> 25:55.090
And this hotel room is
getting crowded,so I'm going--

25:55.100 --> 25:57.620
- where are you going?
- I'm going home,kevin.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.080
Oh,my god. That's it.

26:00.090 --> 26:02.340
- Of course it is.
- Right. Why didn't we think of that?

26:02.350 --> 26:05.350
Home. We'vgotta... no,no,no,no.

26:05.360 --> 26:08.050
Justin,we've got to talk about this.

26:08.060 --> 26:09.650
You're--you're not
gonna let me leave,sarah?

26:10.400 --> 26:12.480
Sit down.

26:13.670 --> 26:16.490
This family is unbelievable.

26:21.620 --> 26:23.860
Saul said you talked to sarah?

26:23.890 --> 26:26.830
Kevin is with justin.
I don't know where.

26:27.110 --> 26:28.370
Oh,he's okay?

26:28.390 --> 26:30.730
So she said.

26:32.020 --> 26:33.540
I'm sorry. Are you mad at me?

26:33.550 --> 26:36.930
No. No,you were just trying to help.

26:36.940 --> 26:39.250
But not actually helping.

26:39.260 --> 26:42.590
All I know is,according to
sarah,kevin felt suffocated-

26:42.600 --> 26:43.300
okay,you know what?

26:43.310 --> 26:47.520
I am sorry I put too many blankets on his
bed,that I use too much ointment on his wound,

26:47.550 --> 26:49.160
at I don't know how to
take his shirt off properly.

26:49.180 --> 26:50.620
But he's my husband.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.230
I should be the one taking care of him.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.430
Then someone should have
made that clear to me.

26:54.460 --> 26:58.840
I just naturally assumed when you came to
this house you wanted me to take care of him.

26:58.860 --> 27:03.260
God,sometimes it's so impossible for me to
understand whe peopl actually want from me.

27:03.270 --> 27:05.910
Okay,you know what? I'm--I'm
sorry I got in your hair.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.230
I'll get out of it.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.220
Fine.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.020
Living in that house is like
living in quicksand. You get stuck.

27:15.030 --> 27:16.780
Yeah,it was hard for
all of us to get out.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.310
- Well,not me.
- What?

27:18.320 --> 27:20.820
You fedexed your laundry
home all through college.

27:20.830 --> 27:22.510
Yeah,and billed it to the ojai account.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.430
Look who's talking. You took six
months to get all your stuff out.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.890
that's right. Every week,you'd
remember something you'd left there.

27:27.900 --> 27:30.130
Yeah,well,dad did your
term papers for you.

27:30.170 --> 27:30.880
He was editing them.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.860
Look,it's not like I'm planning
on staying there forever.

27:32.890 --> 27:34.680
I'm just there until I
have a plan,all right?

27:34.710 --> 27:36.730
And I also have no place to go to.

27:36.760 --> 27:40.910
But you're not gonna get a plan
as long as you're holed up there.

27:40.920 --> 27:45.470
Yeah. You need to have some ramen,bounce
some rent checks,let life suck a little bit.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.960
And trust me,you will be
motivated to figure it out.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.970
Yeah,then you won't want
to go near the place.

27:49.990 --> 27:52.430
- I mean,look at me.
- Right.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.430
- oh,my god.
- Scotty,look,I can explain everything.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.210
Great.How about explaining to me

27:59.220 --> 28:04.200
what part of "in sickness and in health"
means leaving me at home with your mother?

28:04.230 --> 28:05.760
I-I really had no choice.

28:05.780 --> 28:08.580
You had plenty of choices.
You just made thwrong ones.

28:08.590 --> 28:11.930
I mean,the least you could have done
was told us we're being overbearG.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.680
- No,it's not you.
- Fine. Then your mother was overbearing.

28:14.690 --> 28:16.920
Look,neither of you
are overbearing,okay?

28:16.930 --> 28:19.480
- It--it was me and these
stupid dreams. - What dreams?

28:19.490 --> 28:23.510
I mean,what dreams could be so bad
that you flee without explanation?

28:23.520 --> 28:25.660
They're about elizabeth,okay?
I'm really sorry.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.710
I'm just trying to
figure a few things out.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.490
Uh,what's to figure out?

28:29.500 --> 28:31.810
Well,I know we're all meant to
pretend like it never happened...

28:31.820 --> 28:35.690
- excuse me?
- but I am her biological father,tommy.

28:35.700 --> 28:40.310
- Wh-- oh,my god. I'm outta
here,man. - What? Don'T. Come...

28:40.660 --> 28:42.570
- yeah,actually,uh,we,uh,we've gotta...
- yeah,I think,uh...

28:42.580 --> 28:47.040
- you know,look at the rental list and...
- it's a great room.

28:51.570 --> 28:56.340
I don't know. Sometimes it's just hard
for mama bear to be on the sidelines.

28:56.350 --> 28:57.380
nora.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.380
In the pantry.

28:59.390 --> 29:05.170
I don't know where you and kevin are,but I want
you to know that if you ever need a roomy house,

29:05.190 --> 29:09.780
i promise that I will let you be
the one to undress your husband.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.330
What are you doing,nora?

29:11.350 --> 29:14.190
Don't talk to me like our mother.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.860
Grab a glass and park yourself.

29:16.890 --> 29:20.820
Anyway,scotty,I'm just
sorry... and I love you.

29:21.340 --> 29:24.880
Okay. Bye.

29:25.740 --> 29:29.540
okay. This is nice and cozy and... safe.

29:29.550 --> 29:33.800
It's a womb... a womb within a womb.

29:34.110 --> 29:36.330
He was right. Roger.

29:36.340 --> 29:42.210
I'm--I'm nothing but a-a womb
keeper,just a selfish,stubborn...

29:43.040 --> 29:45.280
smothering mother hen.

29:45.310 --> 29:47.580
I don't know what you're
talking about,nora.

29:48.350 --> 29:50.740
I blamed scotty for kevin leaving.

29:50.780 --> 29:52.930
I can't get out of the way.

29:52.940 --> 29:55.940
And then he-- he waltzes
in here,this roger,

29:55.970 --> 29:58.810
this-- after
30-some-odd years--

29:58.820 --> 30:01.980
just wait a minute.just.
What am I missing?

30:01.990 --> 30:04.480
What is it with the two of you,hmm?

30:04.490 --> 30:08.440
Eh,well... there was a party.

30:08.450 --> 30:09.540
The luau.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.310
The au,yes.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.480
I ess I had more than
my share of piÑa coladas,

30:14.500 --> 30:18.330
and william was his
usual charming,funny self.

30:18.360 --> 30:22.370
And he chatted up everybody and...

30:23.210 --> 30:26.390
everybody except me.

30:27.170 --> 30:32.700
And then I met... roger,and
he talked to me all night.

30:33.130 --> 30:37.000
And you hit on him? Nora?

30:39.740 --> 30:41.460
I flirted.

30:41.470 --> 30:46.490
I just wanted william to see that
another man was attracted to me.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.520
G-god. So pathetic.

30:48.530 --> 30:51.950
No,I don't think it's
pathetic,not if it worked.

30:51.990 --> 30:54.760
- Did it work?
- No.

30:55.220 --> 31:01.880
But that night,when I got home,I sat in the girls'
room for a long time and just watched them sleep,and.

31:03.710 --> 31:06.850
For a while...

31:07.100 --> 31:10.200
- that was enough.
- Why are you mad at roger?

31:10.650 --> 31:14.140
God. Because I-I look at him...

31:14.150 --> 31:20.690
and I see this pathetic,insecure
woman that I was,and I hate her.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.780
And I hate that that's
how he remembers me.

31:23.810 --> 31:26.170
Nora,come on. That's crazy.

31:26.180 --> 31:32.060
You can't let some silly litt incident from
the past dene who you are today. Really.

31:32.070 --> 31:37.310
And you were so busy being insecure,you didn't
even notice that he was trying to impress you.

31:37.690 --> 31:41.500
Why else do you think he offered
to do this job for free,hmm?

31:41.520 --> 31:44.450
And you can't get a better
architect than roger.

31:44.490 --> 31:47.690
Okay,so I'm gonna reschedule
your appointment. Yes?

31:47.700 --> 31:49.900
Good. Then can we please
get out of this womb?

31:49.910 --> 31:52.720
- Because my butt is killing me.
- No.

31:52.730 --> 31:58.660
We are not going anywhere until
you tell me about your boyfriend.

31:58.670 --> 32:01.960
- oh,god.
- Yeah. Okay. Come on.

32:02.450 --> 32:04.550
- Start talking.
- Well,all right.

32:30.300 --> 32:36.240
Daddy... sarah was so
mean. They were all so mean.

32:37.260 --> 32:40.250
Well,I'm--I'm
sorry,lizzie.

32:40.260 --> 32:43.560
- Can we just go home?
- Sure.

32:44.320 --> 32:48.060
How about we get some ice cream first?

33:01.260 --> 33:03.990
Okay,I just got a 3-sheets-to-the-wind
apology from your mother that

33:04.020 --> 33:09.220
I will be making a cd of and putting
in everybody's stocking come christmas.

33:09.230 --> 33:11.880
Oh,did you nod off?

33:11.900 --> 33:14.390
Did you have another dream?

33:15.350 --> 33:18.350
But it was okay.

33:18.370 --> 33:20.540
I'll get that.

33:22.540 --> 33:24.940
Hey,man.

33:24.950 --> 33:27.970
Hey,kev,uh,we need to talk.

33:27.990 --> 33:30.350
Yeah,I know.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.300
your briefing on espinoza was dead-on.

33:34.330 --> 33:36.840
He's coming in on tuesday to discuss.

33:36.850 --> 33:39.120
- Oh,tuesday.
- What,that's not good?

33:39.130 --> 33:40.840
No,I--I've got a bunch
of phoners that day.

33:40.870 --> 33:42.970
I've got the "times," the
"tribune," "the star-ledger."

33:43.000 --> 33:45.870
They're really getting you
out there. That's great.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.940
We'll just-- we'll
push it to wednesday.

33:47.980 --> 33:50.690
Robert,you gotta--
you gotta look at this.

33:50.710 --> 33:53.110
I'm basically on a dog and pony
show for the next four months,

33:53.140 --> 33:57.260
not to mention that we are
about to,you know,have a baby.

33:57.270 --> 33:58.810
I'll do espinoza without you.

33:58.840 --> 34:02.610
Robert,I-I don't quite understand
what you're not getting about this.

34:02.640 --> 34:06.320
- Your chief strategist cannot
be part-time. - You're quitting.

34:06.330 --> 34:08.420
Yes,I'm--I'm quitting
because it's not gonna work.

34:08.449 --> 34:11.110
It's not working already.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.460
- but the brain sex was good.
- Well,yeah.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.810
Yeah,that was-- that was
pretty good. That was good.

34:15.820 --> 34:19.760
Yeah. Yeah.

34:19.770 --> 34:23.750
Well,it's got good natural light.
It's better than the other place.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.650
Sarah,this place is a dump.

34:25.659 --> 34:29.520
Yeah,but it'll be your dump. what? What?

34:29.820 --> 34:31.949
Ah,it's mom,isn't it?

34:31.969 --> 34:36.790
Listen,she will take a little while,then
one day,she will turn up with--

34:36.820 --> 34:40.030
with a whole basket of fresh linens.

34:40.050 --> 34:43.710
That's how you'll know that she's finally worked
through the fact that you're no longer at home.

34:43.730 --> 34:45.940
Look,I'm not worried
about mom,sarah,okay?

34:45.960 --> 34:48.080
I mean,you know,she did
more than just cook for me.

34:48.110 --> 34:50.389
She did more than--
than just do the laundry.

34:50.409 --> 34:53.120
She was... she was there.

34:53.130 --> 34:55.260
Oh,she still will be.

34:55.270 --> 34:58.280
I'm talking about my using,sarah.

34:58.870 --> 35:03.530
In case you missed it,the last
time I lived alone,I,uh,I O.D.'D.

35:05.650 --> 35:07.360
Do you think--do you think
I want to live with mom?

35:07.390 --> 35:10.390
I mean,do you think I'm--I'm happy?
No. I know I have to get outta there.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.180
- If you're not ready for this--
- no,it's not that I'm not ready.

35:12.190 --> 35:16.410
I am ready. I-I think I'm ready. I
don't know,sarah. I'm--I'm terrified.

35:16.420 --> 35:18.520
I know you guys want me
to let life suck for a bit.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.730
I just can't handle it
sucking like it did last time.

35:20.740 --> 35:22.980
I--there's--I can't go
through that again,and I--

35:22.990 --> 35:25.880
we don't want that
either,justin.Come on.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.530
You have been to rock bottom.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.060
You don't want to go back there.

35:30.090 --> 35:36.230
Those first graders,they can't possibly
understand what you did,what you've been through.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.810
God,I can'T.

35:37.840 --> 35:41.490
But I do know that if anyone
knows how to be brave,it's you.

35:50.570 --> 35:52.600
I'm scared.

35:52.610 --> 35:58.410
"I agree that I will under no circumstance
advise elizabeth walker as to her true parentage"?

35:58.450 --> 36:00.210
You--you really
want me to sign this?

36:00.240 --> 36:02.510
Look,julia's been asking
how this is gonna go.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.130
- This was always the plan.
- Plan?

36:04.140 --> 36:05.530
Tommy,there was never a plan.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.860
You and I jumped into
this with blinders on.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.990
For there to have been a plan,we would have to
ve talked about it first,which we've never done.

36:11.010 --> 36:12.240
Yeah,well,what's to discuss?

36:12.260 --> 36:14.250
I'm just trying to do
what's best for elizabeth.

36:14.260 --> 36:16.290
Yeah,but this is as if I-I don't exist.

36:16.310 --> 36:18.060
Well,what did you expect?
You want to be her father?

36:18.070 --> 36:19.510
No,that's not what I'm saying. Come on.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.370
- Well,that's not gonna happen.
- I'm just saying it doesn't have to be like this,tommy.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.250
Kevin,I'm her father.

36:23.270 --> 36:28.620
Whatever dreams or feelings you're
having,deal with them. That's it.

36:33.550 --> 36:38.170
here you are. Not too light.
Not too dark. Just right.

36:38.180 --> 36:40.180
Thanks,mom.

36:40.890 --> 36:43.280
Can I... can I talk to you for a second?

36:43.290 --> 36:45.330
Sure.

36:45.920 --> 36:50.160
I,uh,I'm not surehow to say this to you.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.480
I'm moving out,mom.

36:56.490 --> 36:59.510
Oh,god. You,too? I am
an overbearing mother.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.130
No,mom. You've been amazing,all right?

37:01.140 --> 37:03.860
And--and you've been incredibly
patient and you opened up your house,

37:03.890 --> 37:08.190
which has been a safe zone
for me,and I-I needed it,mom.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.450
So you chose to be here,right?

37:10.470 --> 37:14.060
100%. I-I totally did.
I totally did. I just...

37:14.850 --> 37:18.840
you know,I need to figure
some stuff out,mom,and...

37:19.290 --> 37:21.990
are you smiling or are you crying?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.420
I'm proud of you.

37:24.440 --> 37:27.360
I'm so proud of you. Yes...

37:27.370 --> 37:31.630
it is time,and I want you to know,I have
loved every single second of having you here.

37:31.660 --> 37:33.560
Me,too.

37:33.570 --> 37:37.090
So... do you have a place?

37:37.100 --> 37:39.800
Yeah. Yeah. I-I do. I do.

37:39.810 --> 37:42.640
You know,I know where I can
get some great linens on sale.

37:42.670 --> 37:44.400
- Should I pick them up for you?
- yes,please.

37:44.410 --> 37:46.420
- Really? Okay,go. Eat your waffle.
- Yes. Yes,mom.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.860
wow,these robes are like wearing heaven.

37:49.390 --> 37:51.980
How much do you think they'd
charge if we stole one?

37:52.010 --> 37:54.930
We already did last time we were
here. How do you think I found you?

37:54.940 --> 37:57.850
- I was wondering about that.
- Yeah.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.520
Was that when that kid peed
in the planter by the pool?

38:00.550 --> 38:02.750
Oh,my god. Sammy the sprinkler.

38:02.760 --> 38:05.930
You complained to his dad,and
somehow you became the bad guy.

38:05.940 --> 38:08.780
I was the bad guy. He was
ju being a kid. Come on.

38:08.790 --> 38:12.280
If he was mine,I'd do exactly the same.

38:13.310 --> 38:16.120
Do you think we'll ever
have kids of our own?

38:16.710 --> 38:19.980
Yeah. Yeah,definitely.
I--I'D...

38:19.990 --> 38:22.690
I'd love kids someday.

38:23.110 --> 38:26.040
It's weird. I grew up
thinking I'd never be a dad.

38:26.050 --> 38:29.130
Well,it's not that
weird. I mean,you're gay.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.270
No,no,no,it's not that.

38:30.300 --> 38:31.880
It's just,I wasn't sure
if I'd be any good at it,

38:31.900 --> 38:35.170
you know,putting somebody
else's needs first all the time.

38:35.180 --> 38:39.420
But these dreams... in the
last one,she was crying,and...

38:40.500 --> 38:44.980
I knew she really needed
me and that I had to be the.

38:46.170 --> 38:50.440
But the weird thing is,it didn't
feel like a burden anymore.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.610
It just felt amazing.

38:52.630 --> 38:55.040
It's like that famous
line-- "in dreams begin..."

38:55.060 --> 38:57.930
- "begin responsibility."
- Yeah.

38:59.190 --> 39:02.380
Whenever we decide,I'm ready.

39:04.630 --> 39:07.920
I think you would make
an incredible father.

39:10.290 --> 39:12.590
okay. let's put this on you.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.960
- There you go,honey.
- elizabeth...

39:17.020 --> 39:20.430
- you have a visitor.
- look. It's uncle kev.

39:20.860 --> 39:23.360
Don't let uncle scotty see
you in that princess nightgown.

39:23.390 --> 39:25.400
He'll want that for himself.

39:25.410 --> 39:27.800
- I'm gonna go make elizabeth a bottle.
- Okay.

39:27.810 --> 39:31.470
I'm just gonna put on her diaper a
little bit better. Lie down,honey.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.640
- You nt a hand with
that? - No,no. I-I got it.

39:33.650 --> 39:36.900
Good,'cause I'd have no idea what to do.

39:37.300 --> 39:39.440
Look...

39:39.460 --> 39:45.030
with everything going on right
now,the one thing I am sure of...

39:45.040 --> 39:47.680
is that you're her father. So...

39:48.280 --> 39:51.040
I'll defer to you.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.940
- You'll always be a part of her life.
- Good.

39:54.950 --> 39:58.020
As long as I can be the crazy
uncle who buys her tons of presents

39:58.040 --> 40:01.270
and gives her a place to
crash when mom and dad fight...

40:02.410 --> 40:04.530
all right. Look,I'm gonna go help mommy.

40:04.540 --> 40:07.010
you stay with uncle kevin,okay?

40:07.930 --> 40:09.780
- Careful.
- Got her.

40:09.790 --> 40:14.580
Hey,pretty lady.

40:14.890 --> 40:17.210
How are you doing?

40:17.240 --> 40:20.360
I've been thinking a
lot about you recently.

40:20.380 --> 40:23.010
What's with all this drooling?

40:23.040 --> 40:28.300
You gotta quit that by the time
you get into boys... or girls.

40:28.310 --> 40:30.300
One never knows.
