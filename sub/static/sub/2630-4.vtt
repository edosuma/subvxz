WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:10.634
Come in.

00:10.802 --> 00:13.846
I've been waiting for you.

00:16.474 --> 00:17.516
Hi, I just...

00:17.684 --> 00:20.644
Ah! Oh, my God! Monica!

00:20.812 --> 00:22.438
Oh, my God!

00:22.605 --> 00:24.523
I'm sorry! I was...

00:24.691 --> 00:25.983
I was taking a nap.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.445
Since when do you
take naps in that position?

00:31.614 --> 00:34.533
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.828
Yes, I was. A guy.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.747
From work.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.750
I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!

00:44.753 --> 00:46.754
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.048
The one that looks like
a non-threatening Ray Liotta?

00:49.883 --> 00:52.009
Aha. That one!

00:52.177 --> 00:55.929
Give me a second. I'll be out of your hair.
I'm just going to grab a jacket.

00:56.097 --> 01:00.059
When I get back,
I want every little detail.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.354
Maybe that's him.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.357
Okay, um... Okay, um...

01:08.818 --> 01:11.236
It's just Joey and Ross.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.821
Why aren't you at the movie?

01:12.989 --> 01:16.408
We were, but Ross was talking
so loud on his phone, they threw us out.

01:16.576 --> 01:20.037
I had to talk loud
because the movie was loud!

01:22.165 --> 01:25.793
- He's talking to London.
- Did he get in touch with Emily?

01:25.960 --> 01:28.087
No. He's calling everyone
on her side of the family...

01:28.254 --> 01:30.422
...hoping someone
will help him get in touch with her.

01:30.590 --> 01:36.220
I don't care if I said some
other girl's name, you prissy old twit!

01:36.763 --> 01:37.805
Ross.

01:37.972 --> 01:40.307
Way to suck up to the family!

01:47.565 --> 01:52.903
I'm so glad you're all here. My office
finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!

02:43.454 --> 02:47.624
- Hey
- Oh, no, no! Vomit tux! No, no! Vomit tux!

02:47.792 --> 02:49.877
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.086
Vomit tux?

02:51.254 --> 02:53.463
Who vomited on...

02:53.756 --> 02:56.842
You know what? What you up to, Joe?

02:57.010 --> 02:59.720
They're doing
this telethon thing on TV.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.472
And my agent got me a job as co-host!

03:02.640 --> 03:04.183
That's great!

03:04.350 --> 03:08.270
A little good deed for PBS,
plus some TV exposure.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.732
That's the kind of math
Joey likes to do.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.027
Oh, PBS!

03:15.195 --> 03:18.030
- What's wrong with PBS?
- What's right with them?

03:19.574 --> 03:21.325
Why don't you like PBS?

03:21.492 --> 03:26.914
Right after my Mom killed herself,
I was in this bad place, you know, personally.

03:27.081 --> 03:31.710
So I just thought it would make me
feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.796
Because they were so nice
when I was a little kid.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.924
No one ever wrote back.

03:37.091 --> 03:40.260
A lot of those Muppets
don't have thumbs.

03:41.888 --> 03:46.058
All I got was a lousy keychain, and
by that time, I was living in a box.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.101
I didn't have keys!

03:49.103 --> 03:50.520
I'm sorry, Pheebs.

03:50.688 --> 03:54.024
I just wanted to do a good deed,
like you did with the babies.

03:54.192 --> 03:58.528
This isn't a good deed. You just want
to get on TV. This is totally selfish.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.155
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.824
What about you having
those babies for your brother?

04:02.992 --> 04:04.576
Talk about selfish!

04:06.329 --> 04:08.288
What are you talking about?

04:08.456 --> 04:11.708
It was a nice thing,
but it made you feel good, right?

04:11.876 --> 04:13.126
Yeah, so?

04:13.294 --> 04:16.046
It made you feel good
so that makes it selfish.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.757
Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds. Sorry.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.679
Yes, there are totally
good deeds that are selfless!

04:23.846 --> 04:25.764
May I ask for one example?

04:25.932 --> 04:28.642
Yeah, it's... You know, there's...

04:28.810 --> 04:30.769
No, you may not!

04:32.355 --> 04:34.606
That's because all people are selfish.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.817
Are you calling me selfish?

04:36.985 --> 04:39.695
Are you calling you people?

04:41.072 --> 04:45.784
Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs,
but selfless good deeds don't exist.

04:45.952 --> 04:46.994
Okay?

04:47.161 --> 04:48.996
And you know the deal on Santa Claus,
right?

04:49.747 --> 04:54.918
I'm gonna find a selfless good deed.
I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!

04:57.714 --> 05:00.007
- Hello?
- Hello, Ross?

05:00.174 --> 05:01.383
Emily?

05:01.551 --> 05:03.927
Oh, my God! It's Emily!

05:04.095 --> 05:06.179
It's Emily, everyone! Shh! Shh! Shh!

05:07.974 --> 05:09.474
Hi.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.353
I'm only ringing to say
stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.

05:13.521 --> 05:18.734
Wait! Okay, okay, you can hang up,
but I'll keep calling everyone in England...

05:18.901 --> 05:21.403
...if that's what it takes
to get you to talk to me.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.280
Really? About what?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.866
Look, you're my wife. We're married.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.118
You know, I love you.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.662
I really miss you.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.498
I miss you too.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.876
Well, at least I think I do.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.711
She's talking.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.428
When you said "the deal with Santa Claus,"
you meant?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.055
That he doesn't exist.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.806
Right.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.731
Chandler, have you heard
about Monica's secret boyfriend?

05:57.899 --> 06:01.902
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.

06:02.653 --> 06:06.907
So, Mon, when are we going
to meet this new, secret waiter man?

06:07.075 --> 06:10.327
He's really shy. I don't think
he's up to meeting everyone yet.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.913
Yeah, I don't think he's up
to meeting everyone yet.

06:13.456 --> 06:17.501
I don't care, I wanna meet this guy
who's the best sex she ever had.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.420
Really?

06:21.964 --> 06:24.424
That's what you heard? You said that?

06:24.592 --> 06:26.093
I might have said that.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.764
Why is that funny?

06:31.599 --> 06:34.434
Because I'm very happy for him.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.229
And you! You lucky dog!

06:39.732 --> 06:41.149
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.735
Well, Emily's willing to work
on the relationship.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.153
- That's great!
- Yes!

06:45.321 --> 06:46.405
In London.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.449
- What?
- She wants me to move to London.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.700
But you live here.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.747
You know that.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.583
What are you gonna do?

06:59.001 --> 07:01.670
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...

07:01.838 --> 07:05.757
...I could convince them
to move to London with Ben.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.927
I'm sure your ex-wife would be more
than happy to move to another country...

07:09.095 --> 07:11.763
...so you can patch things up
with your new wife.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.976
It could happen.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.817
How you doing? Welcome.
Good to see you.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.403
This'll be your phone.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.700
That's great.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.870
But I'm not really
expecting a lot of calls.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.539
No, you answer it and take pledges.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.040
But I'm the host.

07:39.208 --> 07:43.086
No, Gary Collins is the host.
You'll be answering the phone.

07:44.297 --> 07:48.425
You don't seem to understand.
See, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.136
Well, here's your phone, doctor.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.641
I can't believe I can't find
a selfless good deed.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.311
You know that really old guy
that lives next door to me?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.814
I snuck over there and raked up
all the leaves on his front stoop.

08:02.982 --> 08:07.235
But he caught me, and he
force-fed me cider and cookies.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.657
Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!

08:12.825 --> 08:16.536
Maybe Joey's right.
Maybe all good deeds are selfish.

08:16.704 --> 08:20.165
I will find a selfless good deed.
Because I just gave birth to three children...

08:20.333 --> 08:24.252
...and I will not let them be raised
in a world where Joey's right!

08:25.421 --> 08:28.089
Hey, Monica?
Can I ask you a cooking question?

08:28.257 --> 08:31.551
- Sure.
- If you're cooking on the stove...

08:31.719 --> 08:35.639
...does that mean that your new secret
boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?

08:36.557 --> 08:38.850
Chandler.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.227
Is he?

08:42.980 --> 08:47.359
I think I'm going to respect the privacy
of my new, secret boyfriend.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.778
Why?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.781
If this guy was me...

08:52.949 --> 08:57.244
...and it's me who'd learned that it was
me who was the best you'd ever had...

08:57.411 --> 08:58.787
...I'd be going like this:

09:09.048 --> 09:10.090
All right, Emily.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.133
As much as I love you...

09:12.301 --> 09:15.845
...I'm sorry, I can't
move to London without Ben.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.932
I understand that would be difficult.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.894
Would you consider moving here?
You were moving here anyway.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.272
Why can't you just do that?

09:25.439 --> 09:27.524
I don't know. It's just...

09:27.692 --> 09:34.531
Okay, okay, but I know that even though
I've been a complete idiot up till now...

09:34.699 --> 09:36.533
...you have to come here.

09:36.701 --> 09:40.287
You have to, so we can
work this out together.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.247
All right.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.958
All right? Did you just say "all right"?

09:45.126 --> 09:47.711
I did. Now I'm the idiot.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.046
Emily, that is so great!

09:50.214 --> 09:51.423
It'll be great!

09:51.591 --> 09:55.594
We're going to be
like two idiots in love!

09:59.223 --> 10:02.100
Ross, there's one thing that
really scares me still.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.769
- Yes, tell me.
- You have to understand...

10:04.937 --> 10:07.230
...how humiliating it was
for me up on that altar...

10:07.398 --> 10:10.275
...in front of my entire family,
all my friends.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.445
I know. I am so sorry.

10:13.613 --> 10:17.449
And then, after deciding
to forgive you...

10:17.617 --> 10:21.036
...seeing you at the airport,
catching our plane with her.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.706
Again, very sorry.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.002
I mean, I can't be
in the same room as her.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.881
It drives me mad thinking of you
being in the same room as her.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.344
Emily, there is nothing
between Rachel and me.

10:37.845 --> 10:38.887
Okay?

10:39.055 --> 10:41.014
I love you.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.850
All right.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.896
I'll come to New York
and we'll try to make this work.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.481
That is so great!

10:49.649 --> 10:53.318
As long as you
don't see Rachel anymore.

11:00.451 --> 11:04.037
I asked Emily
if she would come to New York.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.830
And she said yes.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.750
- Great!
- No, no, no.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.629
Only if I promise
never to see Rachel again.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.297
What? You can't...

11:14.465 --> 11:15.548
What did you tell her?

11:15.716 --> 11:17.592
I told her I'd have to think about it.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.970
I mean, how the hell am I supposed to
make this kind of a decision?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.641
I'm actually asking you!

11:25.726 --> 11:28.019
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.146
She's one of your best friends.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.982
But he can't not see Emily,
I mean that's his wife!

11:33.150 --> 11:34.401
- That's true!
- Yeah, right?

11:35.194 --> 11:39.447
But you've known Rachel since high school
and you cannot just cut her out of your life.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.491
- That's true!
- No, you cannot.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.578
Thanks for the help. Problem solved!

11:50.626 --> 11:52.043
- Hello?
- Hey, Mon.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.463
Oh, hey, Joey. We've been watching all day.
When are you gonna be on TV?

11:56.215 --> 11:59.217
There was kind of a mix-up
in my agent's office...

11:59.385 --> 12:01.886
...but I'm still on TV,
and that's good exposure.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.389
You're not on TV.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.936
Oh, okay. How about now?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.023
Yeah! There he is! There he is!

12:14.191 --> 12:16.484
Hello, New York!

12:18.279 --> 12:21.406
Maybe just put the whole duck
right in there. Who cares?

12:21.574 --> 12:24.409
- Now I got the legs.
- Aw! Aw!

12:27.121 --> 12:32.167
How many times have I told you guys
to never watch the cooking channel?

12:33.043 --> 12:34.711
- Hi, Chandler.
- Hey.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.714
Listen, I need that broiling pan
that Joey borrowed the other day.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.215
That was yours?

12:39.383 --> 12:43.887
We used it when the duck
was throwing up caterpillars.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.432
Williams-Sonoma,
fall catalog, page 27.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.225
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.

12:50.936 --> 12:55.398
Hey. Joey's gonna be at the telethon
for the rest of the day.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.609
We have the whole place to ourselves.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.277
Yeah, so?

12:59.445 --> 13:04.574
Just thought maybe you'd want to book
some time with "the best you've ever had."

13:05.618 --> 13:07.494
You know what, champ?

13:07.661 --> 13:09.037
I think I'll pass.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.040
- Why?
- Why?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.679
What's your point?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.894
PBS Telethon.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.687
Hey, Joey.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.982
I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.402
I went down to the park
and I let a bee sting me.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.447
What good is that going to do anybody?

13:44.615 --> 13:48.451
It helps the bee look tough
in front of his bee friends.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.704
The bee is happy,
and I am definitely not.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.542
You know, the bee probably
died after he stung you.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.340
Damn it!

14:03.717 --> 14:06.052
Back on in 30 seconds, people!

14:13.060 --> 14:16.187
Excuse me,
would you mind switching with me?

14:16.355 --> 14:18.648
No way. I'm in the shot, man.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.443
- You've been here all day!
- I'm taking pledges.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.405
And we're on three, two...

14:25.906 --> 14:27.949
Welcome back to our fall telethon.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.910
If you've been enjoying
the performance of Cirque du Soleil...

14:31.078 --> 14:35.123
...and you'd like to see more of the same
kind of programming, it's very simple.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.418
All you have to do is call in and pledge...

14:38.586 --> 14:44.215
...and at that time tell one of our volunteers
what type of programming you...

14:46.343 --> 14:47.552
Okay.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.848
That's it. I cannot make this decision.
It is too difficult.

14:52.016 --> 14:55.226
So I'm just going leave it entirely
up to the gods of fate.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.355
A Magic 8 Ball?

14:59.523 --> 15:02.233
You can't make this decision
with a toy!

15:02.401 --> 15:04.444
It's not a toy.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.406
I don't know what else to do!

15:08.574 --> 15:12.869
I either keep my wife
and lose one of my best friends...

15:13.037 --> 15:16.873
...or I keep my friend and get divorced
for the second time before I'm 30.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.376
So if anyone else has
a better suggestion, let's hear it.

15:20.544 --> 15:23.004
Because I got nothing! Don't be shy.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.590
Any suggestion will do.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.889
Okay, then.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.685
Here we go.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.355
Magic 8 Ball...

15:40.522 --> 15:43.399
...should I never see Rachel again?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.363
"Ask Again Later."

15:50.157 --> 15:53.660
Later is not good enough!

15:59.458 --> 16:00.500
"Ask Again Later."

16:00.668 --> 16:01.709
What the hell?

16:01.877 --> 16:05.171
This is broken! It is broken!

16:05.589 --> 16:07.548
Let me see.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.969
Will Chandler have sex tonight?

16:11.720 --> 16:12.929
"Don't Count On it."

16:17.309 --> 16:19.644
Seems like it works to me.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.940
PBS Telethon.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.149
Hi, Joey.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.442
Hey, Pheebs.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.152
I'd like to make a pledge.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.405
I would like to donate $200.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.864
Two hundred dollars?

16:32.032 --> 16:34.867
You sure?
After what Sesame Street did to you?

16:35.035 --> 16:38.579
I'm still mad at them, but I also know
that they bring happiness...

16:38.747 --> 16:41.249
...to lots of kids
whose moms didn't kill themselves.

16:41.792 --> 16:42.834
You know, so...

16:43.002 --> 16:47.880
...by supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not happy about it.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.842
So there! A selfless good deed.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.761
And you don't feel a little good
about donating the money?

16:53.929 --> 16:57.515
No, it sucks.
I was saving up to buy a hamster.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.727
A hamster?
Those things are, like, 10 bucks.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.396
Not the one I had my eye on.

17:03.564 --> 17:07.650
It looks like we have surpassed
last year's pledge total.

17:07.818 --> 17:08.901
Thank you!

17:09.694 --> 17:14.281
And the pledge that did it
was taken by one of our volunteers.

17:14.450 --> 17:20.663
Oh, boy! And may I say,
one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.999
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!

17:23.166 --> 17:24.416
Oh, look!

17:24.585 --> 17:26.252
Joey's on TV!

17:26.420 --> 17:27.753
Isn't that great?

17:27.921 --> 17:31.507
My pledge got Joey on TV!
That makes me feel so...

17:31.675 --> 17:33.426
Oh, no!

17:40.184 --> 17:41.225
Look...

17:41.393 --> 17:45.730
...maybe I got carried away before,
but there's something you gotta know.

17:45.898 --> 17:50.443
If I'm the best, it's only
because you made me the best.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.363
Keep talking.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.616
I was nothing before you.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.285
Call the other girls and ask.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.205
Which wouldn't take long.

18:02.831 --> 18:06.167
But when I'm with you,
and we're together...

18:06.335 --> 18:09.837
...oh, my God!

18:14.218 --> 18:17.637
- Really?
- Oh, my God!

18:20.099 --> 18:24.185
Now, I understand if you never
want to sleep with me again.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.437
But that would be wrong.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.981
We're too good.

18:29.149 --> 18:32.693
We owe it to sex!

18:34.238 --> 18:36.322
Well, if we owe it!

18:38.659 --> 18:39.992
Oh, my!

18:41.745 --> 18:43.037
When is Joey gonna be home?

18:43.205 --> 18:46.374
I was kind of hoping
we could do this without him.

18:47.876 --> 18:51.087
No, no, no! Leave the gloves on.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.964
But I just cleaned the bathroom.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.675
- Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves?
- Yeah.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.930
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.974
Okay. Ow!

19:04.560 --> 19:07.603
- That wasn't part of it.
- I know.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.745
Hi. You ready? We're going to be late.

19:24.913 --> 19:28.082
- For what?
- For Stella, remember?

19:28.250 --> 19:31.169
She's getting her groove back
in 20 minutes.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.756
Yeah, I totally forgot about that.

19:35.924 --> 19:39.844
Mind if I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.680
Sure, I guess.

19:42.848 --> 19:46.559
Hey, I hear you don't have to go
to London. Yay.

19:47.728 --> 19:52.523
It's not that easy. There's still
a lot of relationship stuff.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.108
Like what?

19:54.276 --> 19:55.776
Just stuff.

19:55.944 --> 19:59.947
You know, kind of what Emily wants.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.533
Why don't you talk to me about it?
Maybe I can help.

20:02.701 --> 20:07.330
No, no, you can't help.

20:08.165 --> 20:12.501
I mean, I kind of have to do this
without your help.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.795
Well, I...

20:15.339 --> 20:19.884
I know you can do that too. I'm just saying
if you need somebody to talk to...

20:20.552 --> 20:22.261
Hi.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.181
Thanks.

20:26.850 --> 20:32.188
Ross, look, whatever this
relationship stuff is that Emily wants...

20:32.356 --> 20:34.315
...just give it to her.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.026
The bottom line is that you love her.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.403
So just fix whatever she wants fixed.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.530
Just do it.

20:43.158 --> 20:47.495
You're going to have to try.
You'll just hate yourself if you don't.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.292
Come on, answer it!
It's driving me crazy.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.045
Hello?

20:56.546 --> 20:58.339
Hi, sweetie.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.466
Good.

21:01.009 --> 21:04.845
Look. Yes, I've been thinking...

21:05.013 --> 21:08.933
...about that thing
you wanted me to do...

21:09.101 --> 21:12.937
...and I can do it.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.025
So will you come to New York?

21:19.528 --> 21:20.653
What?

22:00.235 --> 22:02.528
- Never done that before.
- Nope.
