<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.520 --> 00:06.069
There are 82 letters in here,
and they're all addressed to you.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.879
They stole a couple of designs,
they didn't steal your talent.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.110
We'll put together a web site.
We'll sell them ourselves.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.349
<i>Clothes Over Bro's?</i>

00:12.440 --> 00:15.079
- Oh, my gosh.
- You made that?

00:15.840 --> 00:18.559
- It's actually kind of perfect.
- But it's mine.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.710
You came over here to make
your own dress?

00:20.800 --> 00:25.078
<i>Mayor of Tree Hill,</i>
<i>North Carolina, Dan Scott!</i>

00:26.320 --> 00:28.914
I believe that's the same brand of booze
used to poison me.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.353
And wait for it, this is the good part.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.192
That's someone you care about buying it.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.431
I need to ask you something.
Did you try to kill Dan?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.159
That's the last shred of evidence.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.958
Maybe this can finally set you free.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.838
It's me. Lucas knows.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.070
If you are gonna help me
with Haley's record,

00:44.160 --> 00:46.116
well, you could maybe move
into the house with me?

00:46.200 --> 00:47.553
It's a business arrangement.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.673
<i>Stay with me tonight.</i>

00:51.040 --> 00:53.190
<i>Oh, I was hoping you would say that.</i>

01:41.640 --> 01:43.232

<i>"hoist the black flag,</i>

01:47.080 --> 01:48.399
Great, 0-2.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.948
- What the hell are you doing out there?
- Me?

01:51.040 --> 01:52.473
Why don't you try passing
the ball sometime?

01:52.560 --> 01:55.552
It's called carrying you!
I might as well be out there alone!

01:55.640 --> 01:56.914
All right!

01:57.360 --> 02:00.477
Let's see who won
tonight's pissing contest.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.633
Lucas Scott, 16 points.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.395
Nathan Scott, 22 points.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.353
Combined assists, two!

02:10.600 --> 02:13.478
I guess we skipped the part
about sharing the ball.

02:13.920 --> 02:16.354
Basketball is a team game

02:16.440 --> 02:19.000
and there's no "l" in team!

02:21.440 --> 02:23.715
I assume you morons can spell.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.278
S-U-C-K. What's that spell? Ravens.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.438
Okay, I know you're new at this,
but the cheeriness stops when we lose.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.478
Hey, I'm sorry we lost,
but Nathan's gonna need consoling.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.676
And you're the consolation prize?

02:41.760 --> 02:43.955
I like the way you think, roommate.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.799
Good, because I've got dibs
on the bedroom tonight.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.599
Are you issuing a pre-emptive scrunchy?

02:50.440 --> 02:51.509
Anything for love.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.239
Thank you. You're the best.
See you guys later.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.432
I think you're rubbing off on her.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.353
Why? Is being desperately horny
contagious?

03:01.480 --> 03:03.789
Guess, I'll just have to sleep with Lucas.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.916
Oh, you mean, sleep at Lucas'.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.350
Unfortunately, that's exactly what I mean.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.477
No sex till our hearts
catch up with our hormones,

03:11.560 --> 03:15.189
- but there are other things we can do.
- Oh, really? Under Karen's roof?

03:16.480 --> 03:18.198
Being in love sucks.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.909
And the worst part about losing
is seeing you afterwards.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.479
So then stop losing.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.797
By the way,
I think I isolated your problem.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.838
- It's your ex-wife.
- For your information, she's still my wife.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.035
You leave her out of this.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.634
I would, but I ran into her
in your bed the other day.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.951
I know you usually pull C's in history,
so I'm gonna give you a little help here.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.508
- It has a way of repeating itself.
- What's that supposed to mean?

03:45.600 --> 03:48.194
You want to bounce a basketball
on the court or a baby on your knee?

03:48.280 --> 03:51.317
Haley gets pregnant. You stick around.
How convenient for her.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.278
- It didn't work for Karen, did it?
- It worked for your mom.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.590
Whatever, Dad. Haley would never do that.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.433
I hope you're right.
But you got to ask yourself,

03:59.600 --> 04:01.477
how far is she willing to go?

04:02.920 --> 04:06.799
Haley. Wow. Look at you.
You're absolutely glowing.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.514
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.355
- Sorry you lost. You looked good, though.
- Yeah, thanks.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.789
Listen, I want to know if maybe
you wanted to come over

04:17.880 --> 04:20.916
and I could cook dinner
and maybe breakfast.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.028
I'd love to.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.188
So, what if I start sleepwalking

04:31.560 --> 04:35.872
and my pajamas accidentally fall off
and I end up in your bed?

04:36.520 --> 04:38.670
Well, as long as you're there
in the morning,

04:38.760 --> 04:40.318
"When the sun rises on my heart..."

04:40.400 --> 04:42.038
Lucas Scott, that is so unfair.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.680
You are not allowed to quote
from my letters.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.469
Hi!

04:50.080 --> 04:51.672
- Hey, you.
- Hi! Oh, my God.

04:51.760 --> 04:52.749
Hey!

04:52.880 --> 04:55.678
0-2, can't you do anything
right without me?

04:56.480 --> 04:59.517
- Hey, Nephew.
- It is so great to have you back.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.950
- Is Jules with you?
- No.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.628
Good. I never liked her, by the way.

05:05.800 --> 05:10.351
I'm gonna crash on my couch,
give you two some catch-up time.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.796
- It's so good to see you.
- You, too.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.236
You, on the other hand,
I never want to see again. Bye.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.393
- I guess that makes you 0-3, huh?
- Yeah.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.754
- So, how's Brooke doing?
- Not bad, actually.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.671
It's good to see you.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.758
Okay, so what's the story with Brooke?
You're back together

05:37.840 --> 05:39.910
and she says she never wants
to see you again?

05:40.000 --> 05:44.312
Yeah, we're back together.
But she wrote letters over the summer

05:44.560 --> 05:47.518
and I've been reading one a day
and kind of teasing her.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.512
Love letters.
Well, that's one step up from tattoos.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.309
Look, I know you were
upset with me when you left.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.676
- I should have told you about Jules.
- Yeah, you should have.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.872
But, you know, that's a tough one.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.669
"Keith, your lunatic brother
hired your fiancÃ©e

06:05.760 --> 06:09.275
"to sleep with you and break your heart.
Up for a game of horse?"

06:10.920 --> 06:14.959
- I know, but...
- Look, Luke, I forgave you a long time ago.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.838
You were protecting me, you know.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.992
Messed up as it was,
you did what you thought was right.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.271
So where you been? I mean,
why did it take you so long to find Jules?

06:24.360 --> 06:25.713
It didn't.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.799
Once I knew her real name,
it wasn't that hard.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.509
But the woman that I found wasn't Jules.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.639
Emily wasn't the person
that I thought she was.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.074
More importantly, she wasn't your mom.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.670
It took me longer to deal with that.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.078
That why you came back?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.798
I came back because Deb
told me everything.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.836
Pulling Dan out of the fire
was a brave thing, Luke.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.150
Stupid, but brave.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.549
A lot of guys would have
never gone in there.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.631
Sometimes I wish I hadn't.

07:01.440 --> 07:05.274
- Who else knows what you did?
- You, me, and Deb,

07:05.920 --> 07:08.229
and Dan kind of choked it out of me.

07:08.960 --> 07:13.351
No, it's fine. It's okay.
And Peyton knows, too.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.309
You kept the Jules secret
for two months. Nice work.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.996
- So, how's your mom?
- She'll be happy to see you.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.117
Do me a favor. Let me surprise her.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.674
You got it.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.272
Hey, how was the game?

07:43.440 --> 07:48.036
- That bad, huh?
- No, it's just... This is odd, right?

07:49.120 --> 07:52.430
Like, I don't know, it's just odd
having somebody else here.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.878
It's a good odd, though.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.993
We got any bands yet?

08:00.040 --> 08:01.917
I have calls out to everyone.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.954
Nobody wants to be the first to commit.
But all it takes is one band.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.475
The rest will fall in line. Check this out.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.154
Nada Surf is playing
in Charlotte tomorrow night.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.959
They'd be great for the album,
don't you think?

08:17.920 --> 08:20.434
Okay, just try a little bit of that.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.751
Too much mac, not enough cheese.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.832
So what were you and Dan
talking about after the game?

08:31.680 --> 08:34.672
Just the usual.
Dan trying to control my life.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.118
Look how cute she is.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.353
You okay? Let me see.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.435
You just grazed it.
Let me get you a Band-Aid.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.670
They're in the bathroom. Kiss first.

09:03.200 --> 09:07.398
- What are you doing?
- I was just looking for Band-Aids.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.636
Well, buddy, you found
my birth-control patches.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.871
Those fix a whole other problem.
Next cabinet.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.235
Okay, the bedroom is all yours.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.958
I'll be sleeping on the couch all night

09:28.040 --> 09:30.076
praying I don't hear
the boring married sex.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.275
Oh, my God.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.150
"Congratulations,
your designs have been selected

09:34.240 --> 09:35.992
"to appear at this year's
Rogue Vogue Showcase."

09:36.080 --> 09:37.559
Cool. What's "Rogue Vogue"?

09:37.640 --> 09:40.712
It's like a competition for emerging
fashion designers in New York.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.509
"Your designs will be modeled
for all the major labels." Shut up.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.636
Brooke, that's so awesome.
I didn't even know you applied.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.109
I didn't. That's why this is so bizarre.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.514
Wait a second.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.996
Remember, last year Lucas submitted
Peyton's artwork to <i>thud</i> magazine?

09:54.080 --> 09:55.433
Oh, you're right.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.789
This has Lucas written all over it.
He is so sweet.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.678
Unless, of course, he's being a total jerk
and quoting my letters to me,

10:02.760 --> 10:04.990
which I'm getting back, by the way.
I'm gonna Google this.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.957
Okay, but not in the bedroom.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.833
Still bleeding here.

10:09.120 --> 10:12.317
- Thank you. What took you so long?
- I couldn't find it.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.191
Haley, the other night,
when we were together...

10:17.520 --> 10:20.080
I mean, we're good
with birth control, right?

10:22.160 --> 10:23.593
You're still on it?

10:23.920 --> 10:26.798
Well, of course, I am,
but I wasn't that night.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.314
I'm sorry. I know it was stupid, I just...

10:30.800 --> 10:33.997
- Yeah, I got to go.
- What? What is this?

10:34.080 --> 10:37.231
- I can't believe my dad was right.
- You talked to Dan about this?

10:37.320 --> 10:40.039
Nathan, Nathan, please don't walk out.
You do it all the time.

10:40.120 --> 10:43.874
That's because it keeps me from saying
things you don't want to hear.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.192
Good morning, gentlemen!

10:53.920 --> 10:58.357
Well, 5:00 a.m. Comes awful early,
especially when you're 0-2.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.354
- Get on the bus now.
- Where are we going?

11:03.040 --> 11:04.189
To our gym.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.198
Coach, you're getting senile.
This is our gym.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.670
Not anymore. Come on, load up! Go, go!

11:15.840 --> 11:18.434
I hope you boys
have had your tetanus shots

11:18.680 --> 11:21.592
because you're gonna be spending
a lot of time here.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.830
- What's wrong with the other gym?
- It's got my name on it.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.829
And I'm tired of you all disgracing it.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.193
So it's either find another gym
or change my name.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.833
And I like my name.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.436
You really expect us
to practice in this dump?

11:39.520 --> 11:41.317
Not only practice.

11:41.720 --> 11:45.599
Till further notice,
you're gonna play all your games in here.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.277
But first, you're gonna clean it up.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.073
Here you go, Co-Captain.

12:12.960 --> 12:17.112
- Where are my letters? I want them back.
- Brooke, seeing you like this makes,

12:17.760 --> 12:19.910
"The sun go down on my heart."

12:20.000 --> 12:21.399
Oh, I hate you.

12:21.480 --> 12:25.393
- This is not fair. You don't get to tease me.
- Okay, I'll stop.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.952
You know, I missed you last night.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.429
Well, I was gonna invite you
to spend the night tonight.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.796
You know, reward you
for doing a little writing of your own.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.713
- Reward me?
- But now there's a price of admission.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.110
- Let me guess, the letters.
- Yep. Bring them.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.317
Or you'll find out what
it's like to be teased.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.636
Oh, and don't worry. I'll clean up.

12:50.280 --> 12:54.273
So the guy told me he was 26,
but he was really 22. Big secret.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.028
You think that's funny,
don't you, wearing my clothes?

12:58.120 --> 13:00.714
Well, I made it.
Besides, it's free advertising.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.268
Oh, really?
I thought you charged by the hour.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.555
I'm officially confirming my
room reservation for tonight.

13:07.640 --> 13:10.950
Lucas is coming over for his thank-you-
for-submitting-me-to-Rogue-Vogue.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.395
You do know there are other ways
to thank someone, right?

13:13.480 --> 13:14.833
But none so fun.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.275
I hope you guys have more fun
than I did last night.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.432
Yeah, what caused
the naily interruptus anyway?

13:22.640 --> 13:23.755
Okay.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.916
When Nathan and I slept together,
we kind of weren't protected.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.031
No wonder he was snooping
through the bathroom.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.317
Haley, you're usually
Little Miss Responsible.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.436
I am all for the sex part

13:35.520 --> 13:37.875
but I kind of want to slap you
for the lack-of-protection part.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.234
Brooke, I know about birth control. Okay?

13:39.320 --> 13:41.197
My mom sat me down
a long time ago and asked me

13:41.280 --> 13:42.872
what I was more afraid of,
getting herpes or pregnant.

13:42.960 --> 13:43.995
And what did you say?

13:44.080 --> 13:45.718
I said, "I haven't even kissed a boy
I'm only seven."

13:45.800 --> 13:47.677
Your mom was progressive.

13:49.080 --> 13:52.993
- You're not pregnant, right?
- No, and I'm on the pill now.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.193
- Okay, so what's really the problem?
- That's what I said.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.589
- You told him?
- Yeah, hence the walk-out.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.079
Well, Haley, what did you expect?

14:00.160 --> 14:03.072
There are deal-breakers for
17-year-old boys, even married ones.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.390
There's a time to keep your mouth shut,
and there is a time to lie.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.074
- That was a lie time.
- I don't want to lie to my husband.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.116
I guess that's in the vows, huh?

14:10.640 --> 14:12.198
I wonder if you knew that
when you signed up

14:12.280 --> 14:13.679
at the ripe old age of, like, 12.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.672
Okay, the point is, I think Nathan
thinks that I did this on purpose,

14:16.760 --> 14:18.910
like I was trying to trap him
into something.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.911
- Did you?
- Brooke, no.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.151
Look, I'm just saying,
if you didn't stop him

14:24.240 --> 14:27.596
then maybe, somewhere, on some level,
that's what you wanted.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.954
Still got the best cup of coffee in town?

14:44.240 --> 14:45.912
Guess not anymore.

14:52.280 --> 14:56.034
You shouldn't have come back.
Dan still thinks you tried to kill him.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.554
Yeah, like I told you on the phone,
he's wrong.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.949
Dan doesn't care about
what's right or wrong.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.077
- He cares about winning.
- Well, don't worry about that.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.438
I'm gonna see Dan,
and I'm gonna straighten things out.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.432
He may be the mayor,
sorry about that, by the way,

15:10.920 --> 15:12.831
but I'm still his big brother.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.597
You know, I thought about you
every day I was gone

15:18.200 --> 15:21.636
and you're even prettier
than I remembered.

15:31.960 --> 15:32.949
What?

15:33.040 --> 15:36.555
- Too good to clean like everybody else?
- Yes.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.232
What is your problem, anyway?

15:38.320 --> 15:40.595
My problem is you and Whitey
are both screwing up my shot

15:40.680 --> 15:42.318
at playing college ball.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.516
What, you think no one else
wants to play in college?

15:47.600 --> 15:49.591
No, I think I'm the only person
who needs to.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.477
With my grades, if I don't get a scholarship

15:51.560 --> 15:53.755
- I'll end up cleaning gyms for a living.
- Yeah, right.

15:53.840 --> 15:58.436
Well, well, I see my captains are setting
another stellar example.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.113
Get back to work.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.039
Nathan!

16:18.880 --> 16:22.156
Well, well. The boozehound returns.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.830
Never thought you'd show
your face around Tree Hill again.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.273
I guess you finally grew a pair.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.193
I always had a pair, Danny.
Just ask your wife.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.636
Hey, did you ever find Jules?
I need an address to send her W-2s.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.359
I hear you think I tried to kill you.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.917
Trust me, if I did,

16:40.640 --> 16:41.675
you'd be dead.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.988
Oh, I doubt it.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.990
In fact, the attempt on my life has all the
markings of a Keith Scott operation.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.469
Starting with the fact it was a failure.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.150
You know, I should have run for
this office a long time ago.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.229
With its privileges, I get access to things.
For instance,

16:58.640 --> 17:02.838
the official investigation into the
dealership fire. It was ruled an accident.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.351
But I know someone gave me
a drugged bottle of Scotch that night.

17:07.440 --> 17:11.069
So it stands to reason, whoever bought
the bottle also set the fire.

17:20.319 --> 17:21.958
I guess that means you.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.150
Man buys booze. Call the FBI.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.232
I haven't even started yet.

17:29.480 --> 17:33.792
You can't find something that's not there,
Danny. Like your heart, for instance.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.834
By the way, you ever touch Lucas again,

17:41.000 --> 17:42.672
you'll wish I killed you.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.999
What the hell is this?

17:58.080 --> 17:59.433
Why doesn't my key
to the front door work?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.555
Changed the locks.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.153
And the alarm code,
so don't even think about it.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.309
Funny.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.709
Almost as funny as a mother
who deserts her son.

18:05.800 --> 18:10.032
- At least your father checks in on you.
- Mom's better off without you. So am I.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.549
Really? Then why aren't you at practice?

18:14.680 --> 18:16.830
Whitey kicked us out of the field house.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.751
Now we got to play
in that crappy old gym.

18:18.840 --> 18:19.875
Don't worry.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.110
I'll get my people to figure out
some sort of health-code violation.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.428
I don't even know why you care.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.954
Because you're a high-caliber player,
and you deserve the best.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.679
You mean like Oak Lake Academy? Yeah.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.354
Mom told me they made an offer
and that you kept it a secret from me.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.829
It's nice to see your mother's
still using her mouth.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.990
There's a reason
I didn't tell you about Oak Lake.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.275
Listen, if you play there,
you're a small fish in a big pond

18:38.360 --> 18:40.271
but at Tree Hill,
you can shine for the scouts

18:40.360 --> 18:42.874
- and that's been the plan all along.
- Dad, the plan's not working.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.871
There are no scouts,
not with the way we're playing.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.679
I can exert some leverage, get the offer
back on the table. It's not too late.

18:47.760 --> 18:52.197
Dad, that's not the point. The point is it
should have been my decision, not yours.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.355
You're absolutely right. No one should
determine your future but you.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.829
Not me, not your mom,
not even your wife.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.514
By the way, is it just me
or did she put on a little bit of weight?

19:01.600 --> 19:04.034
You were wrong about Haley.
She's on the pill.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.396
Is that what she told you?
That sounds like Deb.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.912
Well, you know what they say,
"We marry our mothers."

19:12.400 --> 19:15.472
And trust me,
don't take anything for granted.

19:26.480 --> 19:27.959
How's it coming?

19:29.280 --> 19:30.349
It's done.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.150
You know, Andy could have
probably hired a couple guys

19:35.240 --> 19:36.673
to do this for you.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.591
- How is he, anyway?
- Andy?

19:40.200 --> 19:44.034
- Well, he's handsome, generous, wealthy.
- Three out of three ain't bad.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.071
Well, he wasn't the one for me.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.794
Traveled halfway around the world
and figured out that

19:49.880 --> 19:52.519
everything I ever wanted
was here all along.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.119
You know?

19:56.760 --> 19:57.988
Yeah, I do.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.596
Well, I should get to the cafe.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.195
See you.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.918
When was the last time you gave
that car an oil change?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.673
- I've been very busy.
- Busy now?

20:20.720 --> 20:23.712
- So, how was Brooke's letter of the day?
- Angry.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.916
Just reminded me of how much
I hurt her last time, you know?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.558
That's understandable.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.951
You know, you want
your relationship to move forward,

20:32.040 --> 20:33.951
at some point,
you got to let go of the past.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.077
- Start writing a new future.
- Wait a second.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.913
Are we still talking about Brooke,
or you and Mom?

20:41.760 --> 20:43.034
Go long.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.639
So, considering the show's sold out,
and we don't have tickets,

21:08.720 --> 21:11.712
- how are we supposed to get in?
- Relax. Follow my lead.

21:12.520 --> 21:16.115
No, Maurice, you're not hearing me.
I said room-temp water for Matthew.

21:16.200 --> 21:20.193
She's with me. Tell them to make it right,
or I'm gonna crack some skulls.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.320
Okay, how'd you know
he wouldn't stop us?

21:26.400 --> 21:29.472
First rule of a rock tour: Nobody knows
what anybody else is doing.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.194
See that guy down there who's
on two cell phones at one time?

21:42.400 --> 21:44.311
That's the band's manager. Go get him.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.994
- What?
- I got you in here. The rest is up to you.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.275
You can do this. Go.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.990
- Look, I got to go.
- Excuse me, my name's Peyton Sawyer.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.713
I book a lot of bands
for the club I work for, like,

22:05.800 --> 22:08.678
you know, Jimmy Eat World
and I've gotten Fall Out Boy

22:08.760 --> 22:11.320
and now I'm putting together
this compilation CD...

22:11.400 --> 22:14.073
That sounds cool,
but the label doesn't like the band

22:14.160 --> 22:16.958
to compete against themselves,
you know? Record sales.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.952
Okay, but this would actually
be really good for the band

22:20.040 --> 22:23.316
because all the proceeds are gonna go
towards breast-cancer research.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.154
And, besides, when have you guys
cared about the label anyway, right?

22:27.640 --> 22:29.949
The band has a history
of following their hearts

22:30.040 --> 22:32.838
and their own creative instincts.
I mean, look at their second album.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.672
The label wouldn't release
<i>The Proximity Effect.</i>

22:34.760 --> 22:38.719
You guys just put it out yourself,
and you were right. It was a great album.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.313
Benefit album, huh?

22:41.280 --> 22:44.352
All right, I'll talk to the guys. No promises.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.879
You may enter.

23:06.720 --> 23:10.110
You mean the Haley that promised
to get the hell out of here?

23:07.880 --> 23:10.155
Whitey told me to tell you
to get your butt back to practice.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.035
Tell Whitey I'll be back when it's practice
and not spring cleaning.

23:13.720 --> 23:16.871
Did you think about it?
Having a baby to stay together?

23:25.240 --> 23:28.789
Nathan, I am 17 years old.
We're still in high school.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.715
You and I are totally in limbo.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.116
No. I don't want a baby.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.950
Well, you knew you weren't
protected that night.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.837
Well, first of all, it takes two,
guy without a condom.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.951
Second, the only thing
that I was thinking about that night

23:47.080 --> 23:48.513
was being with my husband.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.311
The fact that you think I was trying to trap
you into something is really insulting.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.954
Then why did you go off birth control?

23:53.920 --> 23:55.797
Because I was on tour
and you weren't with me

23:55.280 --> 23:57.953
and contrary to what you were thinking,
I wasn't sleeping with Chris Keller.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.516
You know, I just promised myself

24:02.360 --> 24:04.920
the next time I have sex that I'd be in love.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.678
Well, I guess it's a good thing I'm in love.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.072
I never said that.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.676
- You still should have told me, Haley.
- Told you what?

24:24.840 --> 24:27.229
That when you have sex,
there's a risk of pregnancy?

24:27.040 --> 24:28.314
Haley, I know.

24:29.520 --> 24:32.273
You should have told me that
having sex turns you into an ass.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.231
Haley, what if something
would have happened?

24:34.080 --> 24:35.798
That would have changed
our lives forever.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.594
- Like what, marriage?
- Oh, she's good.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.997
I know we're married.
I'm talking about basketball, my career.

24:40.560 --> 24:43.393
Okay, so let me get this straight,
you're the one with goals and dreams

24:43.680 --> 24:45.910
and the only thing I want,
apparently, is you back.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.192
I'm not that desperate, Nathan.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.070
- Sounds ugly.
- I know.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.512
Makes me feel like I'm still living
at home with my parents.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.430
Without the drinking
and the death threats.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.272
And if you're so worried about it,
then why didn't you stop us that night?

24:58.520 --> 25:00.317
It's just as much
your responsibility as it is mine.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.239
You're right. It is my responsibility.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.958
Let me see the pills.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.159
I cannot believe you still don't believe me.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.715
Here.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.709
- Take them. I don't need them anymore.
- Haley.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.634
Your future as a basketball player
is totally secure.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.149
Your future as my husband, not so much.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.477
Second door slam. You think they're gone?

25:33.760 --> 25:35.990
Unless she's coming back to kill him.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.071
I just wanted to have
a special night with you

25:41.000 --> 25:43.639
to thank you for getting me
into Rogue Vogue.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.595
- What's Rogue Vogue?
- The fashion show in New York.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.713
Hello, I know you sent my application in.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.432
Unless you didn't.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.871
- But if it wasn't you, who else would it be?
- I wish it was me. It sounds pretty cool.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.913
I should know you well enough
to do something like that.

26:01.800 --> 26:05.236
Don't feel bad, I guess I'm not exactly
Encyclopedia Luke-tanica.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.073
I thought it was you.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.913
You know, if you want to get
to know each other better

26:09.960 --> 26:12.394
we could always talk about those letters.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.917
Or we could cut out my heart
and you could stomp on it.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.914
Luke, it's embarrassing.
You were never meant to read those.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.074
Brooke, I love those letters.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.833
The girl in them is so open and honest.

26:25.400 --> 26:29.359
I don't know why it's so easy for me
to get naked one way and not the other.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.798
I do. I hurt you pretty bad.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.678
I'm not gonna do it again.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.919
You're sure?

27:04.720 --> 27:07.075
Peyton, you were great back there.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.720
Whatever happens,
you should be really proud.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.238
Your mom would be, too.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.308
Thanks.

27:23.840 --> 27:24.989
She was great.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.997
She's the reason I picked
your parents to be your parents.

27:27.040 --> 27:30.157
The day you were born,
it was 14 hours of labor.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.116
You kicked through
the whole third trimester

27:34.480 --> 27:36.710
but then you didn't want to come out.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.397
You were stubborn even back then.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.436
When you finally did,
the nurses took you away.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.951
That was the policy of adoption.

27:44.680 --> 27:48.229
But your mom was there,
and she brought you back to me.

27:47.640 --> 27:50.074
She wanted us to spend
some time together.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.792
She was kind.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.711
Can I ask you about the cancer?

27:58.840 --> 28:02.435
I never had the surgery. I had chemo.

28:02.240 --> 28:05.550
It made me really sick,
but the cancer went away.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.999
For a while.

28:11.360 --> 28:15.717
- So what are you doing now?
- I'm spending time with you.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.354
Hello?

28:24.040 --> 28:25.393
Seriously?

28:26.960 --> 28:29.679
No, you won't regret it. No, I promise.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.759
Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. Bye.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.193
Nada Surf is in.

28:38.480 --> 28:42.109
If you're here to get me back in that gym,
you can forget about it.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.836
Heard you fight with Haley last night.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.951
Why don't you stop interfering with things
that you know nothing about?

29:07.920 --> 29:10.434
You know Brooke and I had
a pregnancy scare?

29:11.160 --> 29:13.833
Yeah, your future flashes
in front of your eyes.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.514
Everything you've always
planned on changes.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.239
And for a second

29:19.400 --> 29:21.516
it puts you in Dan's shoes.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.031
The team needs you back, Nate.

29:26.120 --> 29:29.510
You know, you and I aren't the only ones
with futures riding on this season.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.478
But if we get a streak going,
if we take a run at State,

29:32.080 --> 29:34.275
these guys will feel what it's like to win

29:35.040 --> 29:36.678
and that's something
that they will strive for

29:37.320 --> 29:39.788
long after high-school basketball is over.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.268
Think about it.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.513
Thought I told you boys
to kill all the cockroaches.

29:58.520 --> 29:59.953
Whitey, you're practically
begging me to come in

30:01.440 --> 30:02.873
and take this team away from you.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.315
Well, since you've lost every game
you've coached,

30:04.480 --> 30:06.072
it would be a perfect match.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.512
Go ahead, make jokes.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.830
I hope you're laughing
when Nathan transfers.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.430
Because I made a few calls,
and we're out of here.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.670
You really think he'd play
in a crap hole like this?

30:14.840 --> 30:17.149
Come on, Son. Time to go.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.513
For you, maybe.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.630
Get out of my crap hole, Danny.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.239
You know, I should have told you
about Jules when I found out.

30:42.920 --> 30:47.038
- No. It wasn't your fault.
- We shouldn't have secrets.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.837
I saw you the day of the fire
across the street, didn't I?

30:53.080 --> 30:54.832
Why were you here that day?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.599
Well, I...

31:00.160 --> 31:02.071
I came back to see you.

31:02.040 --> 31:05.476
Then I heard that you were on your way
to New Zealand to be with Andy.

31:05.680 --> 31:09.878
So I did something I hadn't done
for a long time. I had a drink.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.715
- Then, I had a few more.
- Is that why you were buying the liquor?

31:14.520 --> 31:16.750
The one that Dan thinks
is some kind of evidence?

31:18.160 --> 31:19.275
Yeah.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.836
After that, everything
just spun out of control.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.591
And that's where Dan's half right.

31:25.120 --> 31:28.749
I was in a drunken haze,
and I did have a broken heart.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.872
And I wanted revenge.

31:31.240 --> 31:34.630
So all my problems pointed
right toward Dan Scott.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.599
And so I

31:38.320 --> 31:39.435
decided to kill him.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.712
- But I didn't do it.
- What stopped you?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.069
Deb.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.633
What are you doing?

32:04.040 --> 32:07.112
First, I'm gonna kill this bottle of Scotch,
and then

32:06.000 --> 32:07.718
I'm gonna kill my brother.

32:09.680 --> 32:13.355
I can't let you do this, Keith.
You're better than this.

32:12.840 --> 32:17.072
- It's the only way. He'll never stop, Deb.
- This is not your war.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.477
You know, Nathan's next, Deb.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.319
Nathan's next.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.239
She...

32:28.040 --> 32:29.996
She came back later that night.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.911
Wake up. Wake up.

32:33.080 --> 32:36.595
- Dan's in the hospital. He's been burned.
- What are you talking about?

32:35.520 --> 32:39.195
- Like you said, it was the only way.
- Deb, what did you do?

32:39.120 --> 32:41.680
It wasn't your war, Keith, it was mine.

32:42.880 --> 32:46.634
<i>I drugged him. I set the dealership on fire.</i>

32:49.720 --> 32:53.793
- But somehow, he got out. He's alive.
- Did Dan see you?

33:01.080 --> 33:04.152
- Did anyone see you?
- No, I don't think he remembers.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.553
Oh, God, what should I do?

33:09.360 --> 33:13.831
They'll think it was an accident.
Just let it go, Deb.

33:10.800 --> 33:14.429
I'll leave town again and
we'll both pretend nothing ever happened.

33:16.800 --> 33:17.915
Okay?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.468
It was Deb? She did it?

33:23.400 --> 33:25.231
You're talking about murder.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.358
I can't believe that Deb would do this

33:31.760 --> 33:33.830
and that you would help her
get away with it.

33:33.480 --> 33:37.393
Deb's been in prison.
Seventeen years with Dan.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.358
She's done her time.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.590
- I don't know what to say.
- Look, I know this is hard to take.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.670
I made a lot of mistakes in my life,
but I can honestly say

33:47.440 --> 33:50.238
that giving Deb a second chance
isn't one of them.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.998
- Cleans up pretty well.
- It's still a pit.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.838
- See how it plays.
- All right.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.954
- You want to know how I did that?
- Luck?

34:18.239 --> 34:20.594
It's a dead spot. Forced you into it.

34:25.639 --> 34:29.599
- I found it when I was sweeping the floor.
- Just like the old Boston Garden.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.759
And the River Court. You see,
I know every square inch of that blacktop.

34:32.159 --> 34:34.674
- It gives me an edge.
- It didn't last time.

34:34.880 --> 34:38.998
Just think about it. We map out
this entire court, use it to our advantage.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.989
It's like the ultimate sixth man.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.672
Peyton, you got these bands to play
on the CD? That's incredible.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.995
Yeah, well, we still have a few slots to fill.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.995
In fact, we're expecting
an answer from one musician today.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.514
- Who's that?
- Haley James Scott.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.795
- What do you say?
- I say, hell yes.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.359
Hey, Mom.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.955
- Everything okay?
- Not for you.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.914
Skills called looking for you
the other night.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.800
You could at least do me the courtesy
of tightening your alibi

35:18.880 --> 35:21.440
before you decide
to check into Hotel Brooke.

35:21.520 --> 35:26.196
You are almost 18 years old,
and I am almost 36 years old.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.959
Now, if you do the math,

35:30.240 --> 35:32.470
I think it's pretty obvious
what my concerns are.

35:31.800 --> 35:35.679
Mom, we didn't do that. We're being
careful, more careful than you know.

35:34.120 --> 35:37.157
It's more than being careful
with the chemistry, Lucas.

35:38.400 --> 35:42.791
- It's about being careful with your heart.
- Like you are with Keith.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.158
I know you're right, Mom, and I get it.

35:50.520 --> 35:54.433
But, I mean, if you're always looking
for reasons not to be with somebody,

35:56.760 --> 35:58.637
then you'll always find them.

36:01.600 --> 36:05.957
And, I guess, at some point,
maybe you should let go

36:04.880 --> 36:07.519
and give your heart what it deserves.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.115
I'm sorry.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.674
We lost two games,
and my dad was making me crazy.

36:25.360 --> 36:29.194
You know, I am really sick
of hearing you say that.

36:27.960 --> 36:31.032
Here's an idea,
if you don't want to be like Dan, don't.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.110
I don't know what hurts worse, Nathan,

36:37.080 --> 36:39.799
that you think I was trying to trick you
into having a baby with me

36:39.400 --> 36:41.914
or that having one with me
is your worst nightmare.

36:42.200 --> 36:46.398
- It's not like that. I'm just not ready for...
- Of course not. Neither am I.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.791
I would like to think
that if something happened,

36:49.560 --> 36:50.993
you and I could...

36:51.640 --> 36:54.518
Fall Out Boy is in. How great is that?

37:25.440 --> 37:28.750
You should be bouncing off
your artistically angry walls.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.068
- Aren't you excited?
- Yeah, I am, but,

37:34.240 --> 37:36.879
I want you to be here
when the album comes out.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.229
I will be here, Peyton. I promise.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.158
It was you, wasn't it?
The dress I designed.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.239
The one you made.
It got me into Rogue Vogue.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.235
Why did you do it?

37:57.920 --> 38:00.798
You know the winner's almost guaranteed
an offer to design their own line?

37:59.040 --> 38:02.032
Yeah, but why would you help me?

38:02.000 --> 38:06.915
Because, despite issues of quality control,
your clothes are good.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.435
- But if you're afraid to go...
- No, I'm gonna go. And I'm gonna win.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.193
So, thanks, I guess.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.870
No, thank you.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.313
- I'm glad you called.
- I have something to say.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.876
We've known each other a long time

38:49.280 --> 38:54.070
and every time that we have gotten close,
I have been stubborn and scared

38:51.480 --> 38:55.075
and have found ways
to let things get between us.

38:56.360 --> 38:59.511
And I can't let that happen again.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.633
Keith Scott?

39:24.160 --> 39:26.037
- Yeah?
- Put your hands behind your head.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.752
What the hell is this?

39:30.200 --> 39:33.397
You're under arrest
for the attempted murder of Dan Scott.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.156
You have the right to remain silent.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.034
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.750
You have the right to an attorney.
