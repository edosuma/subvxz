00:05.239 --> 00:10.275
Patty Wilson, please tell us
what is your favorite hobby?

00:11.711 --> 00:13.445
I like going to school

00:13.447 --> 00:15.514
- and playing the violin.
- No. No.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.756
Patty Wilson, please tell us
what is your favorite hobby?

00:19.252 --> 00:21.220
I like helping the homeless.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.455
Right. Great, great, great.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.424
Ok, if anybody ever
asks you anything,

00:25.426 --> 00:28.127
you always answer
with charity, Ok?

00:28.129 --> 00:32.363
Homeless, pets,
old people, doesn't matter.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.734
This is your pageant, honey.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.370
You're going to take this one
I know it.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.282
Thank you.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.740
We are now
onto the interview portion

02:54.742 --> 02:56.041
of our competition.

02:56.043 --> 03:00.579
Our first contestant
is Taylor Rollins.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.883
Taylor is 11 years old,

03:04.885 --> 03:07.953
and says her favorite
animal is a kitten.

03:07.955 --> 03:11.957
And her favorite color is pink.

03:14.295 --> 03:18.330
Taylor, dear, what has been
the most proud moment

03:18.332 --> 03:19.798
of your life?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.668
Well, I'd have to say
that I was most proud

03:22.670 --> 03:25.003
of myself when I volunteered
in a children's hospital

03:25.005 --> 03:26.505
over the summer.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.573
I felt very lucky
to be able to help kids

03:28.575 --> 03:30.709
who weren't as
fortunate as I am.

03:30.711 --> 03:34.046
Well, that is definitely
something to be proud of!

03:34.048 --> 03:35.447
Thank you, Taylor.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.318
That girl only stopped
peeing the bed

03:39.320 --> 03:40.552
- like three months ago.
- Leanne!

03:40.554 --> 03:41.787
And now...

03:41.789 --> 03:44.956
Our next contestant,
Ms. Patty Wilson

03:46.527 --> 03:47.527
my baby!

03:51.731 --> 03:52.898
My baby!

03:52.900 --> 03:54.466
Patty's from Austin.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.768
Patty's favorite color is...

03:56.770 --> 03:57.770
Gray?

04:00.907 --> 04:04.509
Ok, Patty, your question is

04:04.511 --> 04:08.547
what's the biggest challenge
facing young girls today?

04:10.049 --> 04:11.049
Hmm.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.390
Society's pressure
on girls to look perfect.

04:20.059 --> 04:24.663
This emphasis on appearance
is linked to three most common

04:24.665 --> 04:27.065
mental health problems
that we have today,

04:28.468 --> 04:31.403
low self-esteem,
eating disorders,

04:31.405 --> 04:32.604
and depression.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.745
Ok, thank you, Patty.

04:45.685 --> 04:49.588
Well, that's definitely
something to be proud of.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.090
All right, then,
now, our next contestant,

05:03.569 --> 05:04.870
what the heck was that?

05:04.872 --> 05:07.606
And why would you
say that at pageant?

05:07.608 --> 05:09.541
Well, it is true,

05:09.543 --> 05:10.709
and I thought
the right thing to do

05:10.711 --> 05:11.843
was to tell the truth.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.513
Honey, the truth is relative.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.415
The plain and simple truth
is really plain,

05:16.417 --> 05:18.517
and it's never simple,
so remember that, Ok?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.752
Well, I thought
you did a great job.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.920
I'm very proud of
you, sweetheart.

05:21.922 --> 05:22.922
Thanks, dad.

05:24.123 --> 05:26.091
Me, too.
You were the best one out there.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.026
You had it won, but you
took your eye off the prize.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.061
You gotta keep your eye
on the prize, baby.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.831
The prize is in
the eye of the beholder.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.065
That is the spirit!

05:43.042 --> 05:44.176
There we go.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.052
If only we had more money,

05:54.054 --> 05:55.887
you'd be training with somebody
from dare to dance

05:55.889 --> 05:57.522
like Taylor's doing.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.892
God, if you'd only got
that promotion, don.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.463
Oh, sorry.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.698
Stan Buford got it.
He's dating the boss's daughter,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.420
so unless you want me
to start doing that...

06:11.771 --> 06:14.039
Don't worry, daddy.
You'll get the next one.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.974
Don't hold your breath, honey.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.576
You know what they say,

06:17.578 --> 06:19.044
the world would be
a much better place

06:19.046 --> 06:21.046
if it were run by women,
and I think you could do it.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.814
You're so talented.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.182
You remind me of me
when I was little.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.717
Only you're better.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.986
The only way to make it
in this business, honey,

06:27.988 --> 06:29.221
is to be a triple threat.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.622
Look at Miley.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.924
Great role model, mom.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.793
Yeah, she's a triple threat.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.562
She can sing, dance,
and take of all her clothes.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.498
Well, she's got a great body.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.866
She works very hard for that.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.801
Why not show it off?
I wish I had done it.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.503
I wish I had done
it when I was young.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.506
I would have showed
it all off, now, in hindsight.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.108
Doesn't Miley just go around
licking everything or...

06:50.110 --> 06:52.577
Well, sometimes you
have to sacrifice, don.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.899
Sometimes you have
to lick things.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.286
<i>Carrie Clark
took the stand today</i>

07:01.288 --> 07:04.089
<i>in the federal trial
of Jakob Todd Mitchum.</i>

07:04.091 --> 07:05.757
<i>He's the man who abducted her</i>

07:05.759 --> 07:08.293
<i>and held her captive
nearly 10 years ago.</i>

07:08.295 --> 07:10.228
<i>After only five hours
of deliberation,</i>

07:10.230 --> 07:13.231
<i>the jury found Mitchum
guilty of kidnapping</i>

07:13.233 --> 07:15.300
and sex crimes against a minor.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.902
<i>Carrie arrived at the courthouse</i>

07:16.904 --> 07:18.670
<i>with her parents,
Lou and Carolyn Clark,</i>

07:18.672 --> 07:20.906
<i>who spoke to reporters
after the verdict.</i>

07:20.908 --> 07:23.141
<i>We're just so happy that
this whole nightmare is over</i>

07:23.143 --> 07:25.310
<i>and that Carrie is back
home with us again.</i>

07:25.312 --> 07:27.612
<i>It's been such a
life-changing ordeal,</i>

07:27.614 --> 07:29.014
<i>and I think writing this book,</i>

07:29.016 --> 07:31.816
carry me home:
The Carrie Clark story,

07:31.818 --> 07:34.052
<i>will be very cathartic for me.</i>

07:34.054 --> 07:37.789
All right, geez,
what a media whore.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.791
I think she was just feeling
a sense of relief

07:39.793 --> 07:41.226
from finally having
some good news, babe.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.928
Whatever.

07:42.930 --> 07:46.131
A look into the ongoing struggle
to keep Austin weird.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.236
<i>My-my ear piece's not working.
I can't hear anything.</i>

08:12.224 --> 08:14.159
All right, Patty,
it's time for bed.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.860
Mom, I've almost got
this piece down.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.295
- Come on.
- You see there's this part

08:17.297 --> 08:19.230
- that keeps tripping me up.
- I know, I know.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.765
But if I only practice
that section,

08:20.767 --> 08:22.200
- the piece will be perfect.
- Time for bed.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.335
I could kill your father
for giving you this thing.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.970
Come on, time for bed. Jump in.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.139
You know if you're going
to be up late practicing,

08:28.141 --> 08:29.808
you should be practicing
your new choreography

08:29.810 --> 08:30.810
for your jazz solo.

08:32.144 --> 08:34.712
Mrs. Patterson says
I'm really good.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.648
Says I can even do this
for the talent competition.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.616
Oh, honey,
that's not gonna happen.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.186
I love the way you play.
I'm so proud of you,

08:41.188 --> 08:42.886
but trust me,

08:42.889 --> 08:43.989
nobody's ever won
<i>America's got talent</i>

08:43.991 --> 08:45.390
playing a fiddle.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.993
It's not a fiddle.
It's a violin.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.028
Ok, a violin.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.030
I mean, maybe you get
to be a contestant,

08:52.032 --> 08:53.032
but you don't get to win.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.634
Dancing is fun.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.902
- Mom.
- It's sassy.

08:57.904 --> 08:58.904
People love it.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.106
You still mad?

09:02.274 --> 09:04.309
No. I'm over it now.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.179
You looked amazing,

09:08.181 --> 09:10.382
and before you gave
everyone a coronary,

09:10.384 --> 09:12.050
you were doing real good.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.787
Lay down. Get to bed, come on.

09:17.724 --> 09:21.826
Mom, are you sure I can't go
to Rhonda's birthday party?

09:21.828 --> 09:24.729
Rollerskating?
Oh, absolutely not, baby.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.898
What if you got a nasty
bruise or you get hurt?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.300
Mom, please.
It's so embarrassing.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.903
I'm always left out of the fun.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.838
Baby, I don't want you
to throw away your future

09:33.840 --> 09:34.839
on a dumb, little party.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.741
Look, I know it stinks,

09:36.743 --> 09:38.877
but I wish my momma
would have pushed me harder.

09:40.212 --> 09:42.313
Oh, you have jazz
and ballet tomorrow.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.115
I'm going to drop you
off before I go to work.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.119
I love you.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.322
- See you in the morning.
- Goodnight, mom.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.324
Goodnight, baby.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.700
This one declined, too.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.734
What?

10:04.403 --> 10:06.471
You know what,
I'll just write a check.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.207
Actually we don't accept checks
from you anymore.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.710
It's $25 after they bounce.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.280
Come on, Kandy,
cut me some slack.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.948
I really wish I could, Leanne,

10:16.950 --> 10:20.251
but if we don't get
Patty's tuition in full,

10:20.253 --> 10:22.020
she can't start her
new classes next week.

10:23.055 --> 10:24.422
And we all love Patty,

10:24.424 --> 10:27.092
so I really hope you can
figure something out.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.930
All right, you know what,
I wanted the airline points,

10:31.932 --> 10:33.431
but whatever,

10:34.734 --> 10:36.501
just put it on this.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.269
That's a coffee card.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.504
Just take it.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.910
Great.
You know I'm late for work,

10:45.912 --> 10:49.314
so I will grab that
when I bring Patty for class.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.282
Thank you! Bye, Donna.

11:05.765 --> 11:08.233
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit! Fuck!

11:15.508 --> 11:16.541
Where have you been?

11:16.543 --> 11:18.143
I got here as soon as I could

11:18.145 --> 11:19.511
I had to deal with
Patty's choreography,

11:19.513 --> 11:21.312
- Leanne.
- Hi.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.814
I swear if you're even
10 seconds late again,

11:22.816 --> 11:24.482
you're out.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.085
Jose, my car wouldn't start,
and then it got all smokey,

11:27.087 --> 11:29.454
- and I couldn't see anything.
- Not interested.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.055
Nice try.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.224
Leanne,
your next client is here.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.026
She's been waiting.
Let me get her.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.067
Please tell me
this isn't happening.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.336
This is our fabulous
makeup artist, Leanne.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.273
Leanne milling!
Oh, my god!

11:48.275 --> 11:50.341
Shut up! Crystal Clemens?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.143
I know!

11:52.145 --> 11:54.512
I don't think I've seen you
since our Avon days.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.980
Time just flies
right past, right?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.148
It sure does,

11:57.150 --> 11:58.316
but you look just
as good as ever.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.051
Oh, shut up, really?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.053
Are you kidding me,
you're still a beauty queen.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.988
Oh, my beauty queen
days are over.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.191
I'm a momma now.
Doing the momma thing.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.458
Get out!

12:07.460 --> 12:08.993
How many kids do you have?

12:08.995 --> 12:10.595
Just one.
She's my little Princess.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.264
Her name is Patricia,
but I call her Patty.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.899
She's picking up right
where I left off.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.301
Oh, that is just precious.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.036
I bet she's gonna be
a winner just like you.

12:19.471 --> 12:22.440
Well, let's get you
in the makeup chair.

12:23.542 --> 12:24.976
No kids for me yet.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.444
Not with our hectic schedule.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.912
My husband's an old man.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.348
How old is he?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.584
No, "oil" man.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.519
- Oh, oil. Wow.
- Yeah.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.322
I mean, but he's old, too,
so, whatever.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.457
Every other day,
we got some kinda party

12:39.459 --> 12:41.192
or event we gotta go to.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.894
Oh, we're also building
our dream house

12:42.896 --> 12:44.996
up in Aspen right now, so, yeah.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.031
Anyway, I'm sure once
all that settles down,

12:47.033 --> 12:50.001
we'll probably, you know,
pop out a couple.

12:50.003 --> 12:53.104
Well, what are we
going to do today?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.939
Oh, well, we have this huge
black-tie charity event

12:54.941 --> 12:57.208
to go to for children
in Africa or somewhere,

12:57.210 --> 12:59.477
I don't know, anyway,
the governor's gonna be there.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.180
I just want to look really good
in case the cameras are rolling.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.082
Anyway, I just keep going on
and on about me,

13:04.084 --> 13:05.149
tell me about you.
What is going on?

13:05.151 --> 13:06.517
How have you been?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.620
Did you marry
that hot boyfriend of yours?

13:08.622 --> 13:11.089
I swear I always thought
I was going to see you

13:11.091 --> 13:12.557
on <i>days of our lives</i>
<i>or something.</i>

13:12.559 --> 13:14.659
- Stop it.
- I did.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.194
What are you
talking about Billy?

13:16.196 --> 13:18.663
Oh, please, honey,
I outgrew all of that

13:18.665 --> 13:20.365
when don came along.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.034
He just walked in
and swept me off my feet.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.969
I mean his business
was just blowing up,

13:24.971 --> 13:27.171
so we moved to Austin.

13:27.173 --> 13:30.942
Yeah, you know, he's a super
successful computer guy.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.377
Well, then good for you

13:32.379 --> 13:33.978
for doing these
little makeup jobs

13:33.980 --> 13:34.980
and helping chip in.

13:36.548 --> 13:39.484
Well, you know what,
I don't even have to do this,

13:39.486 --> 13:41.920
- hm-mm.
- But I love it, it's a passion.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.555
So, I needed a little
creative outlet.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.258
I come in here whenever I want.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.526
You just work whenever?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.662
Yeah, my own schedule,
my own life.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.297
For me, I mean,
when you're a mom,

13:52.299 --> 13:53.531
I mean, I know you
don't know yet,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.300
but sometimes when
you are a mom,

13:55.302 --> 13:57.001
you just need a little me time.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.504
Understood.
Whatever you can get.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.006
Whatever works for you.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.408
You know what?
I'm actually just talking

14:03.410 --> 14:05.476
way too much,
and you should be relaxing,

14:05.478 --> 14:07.312
so why don't you lay back,

14:07.314 --> 14:08.713
and as soon as you finish
reading that magazine,

14:08.715 --> 14:10.014
you'll be gorgeous.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.049
Ok.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.483
Oh, this poor girl.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.520
I swear I have seen her
on so many interviews.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.722
And her parents have
done the rounds, too.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.524
They're always so positive.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.726
I don't think I could do it.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.628
I know I couldn't do it.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.333
Oh, my god!

14:28.335 --> 14:30.335
Leanne, are you Ok?

14:30.337 --> 14:31.369
Oh, I can't move.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.171
Call the ambulance.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.506
- Oh, it hurts so bad.
- Here, honey, look I'm sorry,

14:35.508 --> 14:38.209
but I really gotta get
somebody to finish my face.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.377
Sorry.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.546
What, what?

14:41.548 --> 14:44.015
Relax, calm down.
The medics are on their way.

14:46.151 --> 14:47.285
Damn it.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.488
Oh, shit.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.326
You know it's bad enough
I fall on my ass

14:55.328 --> 14:56.494
in front of everybody
in the salon,

14:56.496 --> 14:58.062
but in front of crystal Clemens.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.464
What do you care
what that dummy thinks?

14:59.466 --> 15:02.734
Because, don, I worked
with her at Avon.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.569
She was like this
little, annoying dog

15:04.571 --> 15:05.770
that was always
nipping at my heels

15:05.772 --> 15:07.238
wanting everything that I had.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.541
Boy, how the tides have turned.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.510
Coming in there talking
about her rich husband,

15:12.512 --> 15:14.512
and her giant mansions,
and, "oh, I gotta look good

15:14.514 --> 15:17.682
in case my cameras are rolling."

15:17.684 --> 15:19.384
I bet she didn't even have
a charity thing to go to,

15:19.386 --> 15:20.718
I bet she just wanted
to come in there

15:20.720 --> 15:23.521
and rub her fabulous
life in my face.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.443
I didn't know you thought
your life was so lousy.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.627
Oh, don, come on,
you know what I meant.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.362
I just always thought
that I was going to be,

15:31.364 --> 15:33.398
you know, something more.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.437
Well, why don't you just,
you know,

15:39.439 --> 15:41.305
put the focus
a little less on Patty

15:41.307 --> 15:42.473
and a little bit more on you,

15:42.475 --> 15:44.275
do something that
makes you happy.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.743
Why don't you take
a dance class again?

15:45.745 --> 15:47.779
You love that salsa dancing
or whatever, right?

15:47.781 --> 15:49.480
With what money, don?

15:49.482 --> 15:51.215
I don't even know
how we're going to pay

15:51.217 --> 15:52.857
for Patty's classes
now that I can't work.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.187
God, she's gonna
be so disappointed.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.355
Well, you know,
maybe we can scale back

15:57.357 --> 15:58.689
on Patty's activities.

15:58.691 --> 16:02.126
I think it might be
good for her, possibly.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.532
You know what,
Donny, I'm real tired.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.534
I don't feel so good.
I'm just going to go to sleep.

16:09.536 --> 16:10.536
- Ok.
- Hey.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.104
Rub my feet 'til I fall asleep.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.139
- Ok.
- Pretty please.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.142
And I'll pay you back
tomorrow night.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.380
All right.

16:25.684 --> 16:26.784
Ow, Jesus.

17:10.128 --> 17:11.262
What?

17:11.263 --> 17:12.396
What the hell time is it?

17:12.397 --> 17:13.631
Oh, shit.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.502
Oh, please be Ok.

17:17.503 --> 17:19.270
Jesus, Leanne,
how could you be so stupid?

17:19.271 --> 17:21.339
Everything's going
to be just fine.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.207
I'm sure I'm going to get there,
and she'll be still at school,

17:23.209 --> 17:25.143
just laughing and hanging out
and talking with the teachers.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.477
Oh, please be here.

17:29.615 --> 17:30.681
Excuse me, sir.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.816
Have you seen a little girl?

17:31.818 --> 17:33.317
- She's got blonde hair.
- What?

17:33.319 --> 17:34.585
- Her name's Patty Wilson.
- No.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.654
- About 10 years old.
- They all gone.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.556
I mean, school's over.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.924
Oh, my god.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.660
Don, it's Leanne,
where the hell are you?

17:43.897 --> 17:45.530
Come on, move it!

17:45.532 --> 17:46.831
Patty!

17:50.836 --> 17:52.470
Yes, I'll still hold.

17:54.473 --> 17:55.673
Patty.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.808
What are you doing? My god.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.877
- Where were you?
- Where were you?

17:59.879 --> 18:01.746
I was looking
all over town for her.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.448
Well, I waited over an hour.
I called you a bunch of times,

18:04.450 --> 18:06.717
and you didn't answer,
so I called daddy.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.419
Oh, my god, baby, I'm so sorry.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.655
My back was hurting so bad,
and I took some pills.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.856
And then I must have
just gotten knocked out.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.357
Told ya.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.293
Why didn't you answer
your cell phone?

18:15.295 --> 18:16.727
The battery was dead.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.462
Oh, I was so scared.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.797
I don't know what I would
ever do if I lost you.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.365
Well, you'd be on the news

18:21.367 --> 18:23.301
threatening the kidnappers,
I'm sure.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.436
That's right.
Nobody hurts my baby.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.720
Ugh!

19:00.472 --> 19:01.606
Surprise.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.741
Oh, hi, Billy.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.844
Leanne.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.779
I know I haven't
aged a day, right.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.950
Look at you, you look good.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.585
It's so good to see you

19:14.587 --> 19:16.587
15185, there we go.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.772
Hey, man, there's some chick
out here to see you.

19:34.774 --> 19:35.774
All right.

19:41.580 --> 19:42.580
Billy?

19:44.283 --> 19:45.283
Really?

19:46.285 --> 19:47.918
What the hell do you want?

19:47.920 --> 19:50.621
Well, that's a fine hello
after all this time.

19:50.623 --> 19:54.525
Oh, well, hello, Leanne.
It's so great to see you again.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.628
Ok, I get it. You're right.
I should have called first.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.929
But I wanted to surprise you.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.464
Why the hell would
you want to do that

20:00.466 --> 20:01.466
after what you did?

20:02.467 --> 20:04.502
Listen, Billy.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.871
I'm sorry about the way
things ended for us,

20:06.873 --> 20:09.040
but I've changed a lot,

20:09.042 --> 20:11.375
and I feel like I owe
you an explanation.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.910
That's nice.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.945
But to be honest,
I don't give a shit anymore.

20:16.682 --> 20:17.682
Ok.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.518
This was a mistake.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.019
Forget I was even here.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.823
No, wait.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.658
Since you took the trouble
to come out here,

20:27.660 --> 20:28.993
just say what you want to say.

20:31.963 --> 20:34.398
You think maybe
there's somewhere more private

20:34.400 --> 20:35.466
where we could go?

20:54.353 --> 20:55.886
I thought I'd never
hear from you again

20:55.888 --> 20:57.588
after you left me high and dry

20:57.590 --> 20:59.790
for that pussy-ass
husband of yours.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.528
I still remember

21:04.530 --> 21:06.764
sitting there at Christmas
dinner with my folks,

21:07.966 --> 21:09.600
waiting for you to show up,

21:12.604 --> 21:13.871
but you never did.

21:16.808 --> 21:17.808
Billy.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.144
I'm so sorry.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.079
If I could take it all back,
I would.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.649
How are they?

21:25.651 --> 21:26.651
My folks?

21:27.886 --> 21:31.422
They died a few years back.
Tornado.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.424
Jesus.

21:33.592 --> 21:34.859
God, I'm so sorry.

21:36.027 --> 21:37.161
Oh, Billy.

21:43.602 --> 21:44.602
So was it worth it?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.739
Living like a queen
in the lap of luxury?

21:48.741 --> 21:50.975
Yeah, right.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.743
Not even close.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.545
When I first started dating him,

21:54.547 --> 21:56.113
he was working for his daddy
making a fat allowance.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.581
We were living like rock stars,

21:57.583 --> 22:00.751
but it was a government probe,

22:00.753 --> 22:03.421
so no company, no inheritance.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.890
You know, I feel like
I got swindled.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.925
- Don manipulated me.
- Wait! Wait! Please.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.627
Do not say his name to me.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.061
Ok.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.464
He, who will remain nameless,

22:14.966 --> 22:17.568
did fully take advantage
of me and my naivety.

22:17.570 --> 22:21.138
Aw! Now he's just
a regular working stiff, huh?

22:22.207 --> 22:23.541
That serves you right.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.077
Billy.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.980
Leaving you was
the dumbest thing I ever done.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.683
You gotta know I regretted
it all these years,

22:32.685 --> 22:35.920
and I never ever
stopped loving you.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.656
Then why are you just
coming to see me now?

22:39.925 --> 22:40.925
Because.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.695
I had a daughter to raise.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.597
I was trapped,

22:46.599 --> 22:49.800
you know,
but you know I can't...

22:49.802 --> 22:52.970
I can't deny my feelings
for you anymore.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.673
I wanted to leave him
for the longest time,

22:55.675 --> 22:57.074
but I can't.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.677
I can't afford to
support me and my baby.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.745
Well, she's not a baby anymore.

23:01.747 --> 23:02.947
She's 11 now.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.248
You would love her.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.685
Oh, I had a dream
the other night

23:07.687 --> 23:09.587
that it was the three of us,

23:09.589 --> 23:10.888
and we went to six flags

23:10.890 --> 23:11.889
six flags?

23:11.891 --> 23:13.924
And we were season-pass holders,

23:13.926 --> 23:16.927
and we got on all the rides,
and it was so much fun.

23:18.498 --> 23:21.966
I really want that dream
to be a reality, Billy.

23:23.835 --> 23:26.871
The only happy times in my life
were my dreams of you.

23:26.873 --> 23:31.208
Oh, baby, that is so sweet.

23:31.210 --> 23:34.044
Oh, pinch me because this
better not be no damn dream.

23:35.113 --> 23:36.780
How 'bout a kiss instead?

23:42.053 --> 23:43.754
I can't believe
this is happening.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.257
You know what?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.961
I loved you then,
and even after what you did,

23:55.033 --> 23:57.935
you make me the happiest girl
in the whole world.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.570
Oh, I can't wait to start
our life together.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.138
Then why don't we?

24:01.140 --> 24:03.674
Because I don't have no money
to support me and Patty.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.843
I can't afford
a fancy divorce lawyer.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.012
I'm still paying off
a bunch of fucking equipment

24:08.014 --> 24:09.580
- and tools and...
- Ok.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.081
I have a plan.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.784
Because I was praying
that you would take me back.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.152
I think it's our only chance.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.322
- We kinda gotta get creative.
- Ok.

24:20.759 --> 24:22.560
We need to kidnap my daughter.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.763
Come again.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.131
Not for real.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.699
It'll just be for show.

24:28.701 --> 24:29.733
We will be
in control of everything.

24:29.735 --> 24:31.001
She will be totally safe.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.770
What the hell
are you talking about?

24:32.772 --> 24:35.239
We just need to keep her missing
for maybe a month, right?

24:35.241 --> 24:37.174
And then the media storm
will start.

24:37.176 --> 24:40.110
And I'll be like, oh, where's
Patty Wilson and such?

24:40.112 --> 24:42.346
Then I'll go on TV
crying over my baby,

24:42.348 --> 24:44.815
and then a month
later, she's found.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.184
Look at Carrie Clark.
She's been on TV show,

24:47.186 --> 24:49.253
every major newspaper,
magazine cover,

24:49.255 --> 24:50.788
everything.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.090
But here's where
the real money starts.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.292
Her and her parents
got a book deal

24:55.294 --> 24:57.595
and a TV movie.

24:59.164 --> 25:03.000
They're making millions, Billy.
They are cashing in.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.171
What do you think?

25:08.807 --> 25:10.341
I think you're out
of your damned mind.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.743
I mean I haven't
worked out the details,

25:12.745 --> 25:14.712
but I think it
could really work,

25:14.714 --> 25:16.180
and I do think it's the only way

25:16.182 --> 25:17.815
that we can really be together.

25:21.052 --> 25:22.052
All right.

25:23.221 --> 25:25.656
All right, if we do this,

25:25.658 --> 25:26.890
we do it my way.

25:26.892 --> 25:27.925
I'm not putting my
neck on the line

25:27.927 --> 25:29.159
without a real plan,

25:29.161 --> 25:31.028
and we're going
to need some help.

25:32.631 --> 25:34.031
We're gonna need JT.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.833
Who's JT?

25:35.835 --> 25:38.035
I don't wanna be
a part of no kidnappin', Billy.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.703
I'm nervous about it, man.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.305
I can't get in trouble again!

25:43.642 --> 25:45.876
I mean what am I supposed
to do with some kid?

25:45.878 --> 25:46.877
I don't know nothing
about changing no diapers

25:46.879 --> 25:48.245
or none of that stuff.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.647
She's like 10 or 11
or something, man,

25:49.649 --> 25:50.714
she don't need no diapers.

25:51.816 --> 25:53.150
Billy, Billy, Billy, man,

25:53.152 --> 25:54.785
you my best friend and all,

25:54.787 --> 25:56.687
JT, quit worrying, man!

25:56.689 --> 25:57.689
Just stop!

25:58.690 --> 25:59.890
It's all cool.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.792
We got the perfect plan.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.227
And like you said,
I'm your best friend.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.795
Don't I always have your back?

26:04.797 --> 26:07.231
Didn't I protect
your ass in prison?

26:08.667 --> 26:09.967
You owe me, man.

26:16.808 --> 26:18.175
So this the girl
you used to always talk about

26:18.177 --> 26:19.177
when we was locked up?

26:20.278 --> 26:21.812
Yeah, the one and the same.

26:23.381 --> 26:24.381
Shit! She's here.

26:30.188 --> 26:31.188
Woo!

26:31.190 --> 26:33.323
- Hey beautiful!
- Jesus.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.192
Billy, you gave me
a heart attack.

26:35.194 --> 26:39.163
Been missing you, baby. My god,
I've been dying to see you.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.765
Yeah, well, me too.
We can't be seen together.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.301
Well, I think
we're pretty safe here.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.036
No kidding.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.172
I felt like I was driving
to the ends of the earth.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.274
JT, come out, meet Leanne!

26:54.145 --> 26:56.213
Hey, Leanne,
this is my buddy, JT.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.248
This is Leanne.
The love of my life.

27:00.051 --> 27:01.452
- Hello.
- Ma'am.

27:02.887 --> 27:05.422
So this is your place?

27:05.424 --> 27:08.292
Nobody else lives
here or stays here?

27:08.294 --> 27:10.194
Yes, ma'am, it's just me here.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.095
It's not much, but I think your
daughter would be comfortable.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.030
Hell, yeah, she will.

27:13.032 --> 27:16.467
He's got a satellite receiver,
a DVD player, even an x-box.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.035
It's gonna be like summer camp.

27:19.871 --> 27:22.239
Billy says
you're a good man, JT.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.507
But this is my baby.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.342
I mean, she is my life.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.512
I'm doing this for her,
but it ain't gonna be easy,

27:28.514 --> 27:30.380
so I need to make sure
that she's gonna be happy

27:30.382 --> 27:31.382
and safe.

27:33.017 --> 27:35.185
If so much of a hair
on her head is harmed,

27:35.187 --> 27:37.788
I will see to it that
the son of a bitch who hurts her

27:37.790 --> 27:39.356
is skinned alive
and fed to the wolves.

27:39.358 --> 27:43.360
Whoa, baby, baby, I told you.
JT's a Teddy bear.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.529
He couldn't hurt a fly.

27:45.531 --> 27:46.864
Am I clear?

27:46.866 --> 27:47.866
- Yes, of course, ma'am.

27:49.234 --> 27:53.203
Then if anything inappropriate
were to happen,

27:54.439 --> 27:57.975
I will come here myself
and cut it off.

27:59.410 --> 28:02.112
Ma'am, I'm no sicko pervert.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.947
I just want to help you
and your daughter get away

28:03.949 --> 28:05.315
from that monster
you're married to.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.050
I don't take kindly to men

28:07.052 --> 28:08.385
beatin' on no women
and children.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.053
I had to tell him, baby.

28:14.325 --> 28:16.059
It's Ok. It's all right.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.200
I really... I really wish
there was another way.

28:24.302 --> 28:25.803
He'll never let me go.

28:27.238 --> 28:30.407
And I ain't got the money
to support us.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.376
I understand, ma'am.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.345
Sometimes a mother's gotta
do what a mother's gotta do.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.948
- We'll take care of it though.
- Yeah, we'll get it done, baby.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.317
Oh, thank you.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.122
Never understood dog people.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.857
They're not your kids.

28:49.194 --> 28:53.564
Nancy, I need you to go cover
the annual Portlandia festival.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.866
Ugh, seriously, Alan?

28:55.868 --> 28:57.534
Hey, look, you don't remain
number four in Austin

28:57.536 --> 29:00.070
by not paying homage
to the barbecue.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.005
How long are you going to
keep me in the dog house

29:02.007 --> 29:03.373
with these ridiculous stories?

29:03.375 --> 29:05.309
It was a minor mistake.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.878
You accused a city
official of bestiality.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.480
On the air.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.583
It's not my fault that
he got rid of the evidence

29:12.585 --> 29:14.985
before animal
control intervened.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.453
You're just lucky
he settled for a retraction

29:16.455 --> 29:17.988
and didn't sue the station,

29:17.990 --> 29:19.523
and that you still have a job.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.225
Yeah, well, you didn't
have to kiss his butt

29:21.227 --> 29:22.547
and go to his
little dinner party.

29:23.461 --> 29:24.461
It was a great party.

29:25.530 --> 29:27.431
I hope you didn't try the lamb.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.233
Oh...

29:29.235 --> 29:31.001
That's disgusting.

29:33.304 --> 29:34.304
Oh, god.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.075
Al, you know
I'm your best reporter.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.611
No, you're not.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.313
Who is?

29:43.315 --> 29:44.982
Steve Breckenridge!

29:49.053 --> 29:50.587
He's pretty good.

31:14.105 --> 31:15.572
Goodnight, baby.

31:22.413 --> 31:23.981
I love you so much.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.448
Please tell me
I'm hallucinating.

32:08.159 --> 32:09.459
What the hell
are you guys doing?

32:09.461 --> 32:10.761
Trying to get the damn ladder up

32:10.763 --> 32:12.295
- the stupid fucking thing.
- Stop it.

32:12.297 --> 32:13.697
Are you crazy?

32:13.699 --> 32:16.199
It's a one-story house.
Why are you on a ladder?

32:16.201 --> 32:18.168
I'm letting you two idiots
in the back door, remember?

32:18.170 --> 32:20.504
Wait, what?
Don't call me an idiot.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.672
I thought the plan was to go
in through the kid's window?

32:22.674 --> 32:24.074
It's only supposed
to look like that.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.108
You don't actually do it.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.110
What if someone sees you?

32:27.112 --> 32:30.647
And what are you wearing?
Costumes? Jesus, come on.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.182
Wait, put the ladder down.

32:34.185 --> 32:35.752
Make up your mind, woman.

32:38.689 --> 32:40.724
Amateur hour with you two.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.592
Do you know
how hard that thing is

32:42.594 --> 32:45.062
- to strap on top of a Chevelle?
- Well, why'd you bring it?

32:46.764 --> 32:48.398
Get inside.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.136
You are so sexy when you're mad.

32:54.172 --> 32:55.172
Come here.

32:56.174 --> 32:57.641
Are you drunk?

32:57.643 --> 33:00.343
Drunk might be overstating it
a little bit, huh?

33:01.612 --> 33:04.314
- JT?
- He had a few beers.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.517
Are you out of your mind?
Give me that.

33:07.519 --> 33:08.785
Don't worry, Leanne.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.620
I drove over here,
and I'm sober.

33:10.622 --> 33:11.721
You haven't had
anything to drink?

33:11.723 --> 33:13.356
No, no, I've been too nervous.

33:13.358 --> 33:14.858
Well, at least one of you
is using your head.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.760
Well, I had to take
the edge off, baby,

33:16.762 --> 33:18.762
but I'm cool.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.565
Let's do this.
Where's the little kid?

33:22.667 --> 33:24.201
Be real gentle with her, Ok?

33:24.203 --> 33:25.235
And make sure
that it's warm in there

33:25.237 --> 33:27.104
because she's always cold,

33:27.106 --> 33:29.106
and I gave you information
in case there's an emergency.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.540
Don't worry, Leanne.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.609
I got the instructions
just like you told us.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.277
I took care of everything.

33:34.279 --> 33:35.779
She's gonna be
fine, right, Billy?

33:44.755 --> 33:46.823
Motherfucker.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.596
Steel my woman, huh?

33:52.598 --> 33:55.732
Take a whiff of that,
you piece of shit, mother...

33:55.734 --> 33:57.434
What in god's name
are you doing?

33:57.436 --> 33:58.902
I was just having a little fun
with shitface here.

33:58.904 --> 34:00.403
Are you... that is disgusting.

34:00.405 --> 34:01.638
Are you crazy?
You'll wake him up.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.273
Wake him up?
What do you mean?

34:03.275 --> 34:04.908
You said they'd be
out 'til morning.

34:04.910 --> 34:07.030
Well, I don't know. I've never
drugged anybody before.

34:08.411 --> 34:10.714
Oh, god, I have been
missing you, baby.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.916
And you're not even
giving me a proper hug.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.751
Billy. Really?

34:14.753 --> 34:15.886
JT, a little privacy?

34:17.155 --> 34:18.455
- Ok.
- Come on.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.489
Let's do it right here
on the bed, huh,

34:20.492 --> 34:21.658
right next to this shithead.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.260
Knock it off!

34:23.262 --> 34:24.628
Are you nuts!

34:24.630 --> 34:26.463
God, we are seriously
wasting time, you guys.

34:26.465 --> 34:29.166
Now get out of here. Come on.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.500
There's enough time
to fool around later.

34:30.502 --> 34:31.768
- All right.
- Oh, man.

34:40.277 --> 34:41.344
Don!

34:42.380 --> 34:44.380
Don! Patty's gone!

34:45.650 --> 34:48.418
Don, come in here!
Patty's missing!

34:49.520 --> 34:52.621
Don, I can't find her anywhere.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.225
Don!

34:55.226 --> 34:57.327
What?

34:58.362 --> 34:59.396
Where is she?

34:59.398 --> 35:01.731
- Oh, no.
- Patty! Patty!

35:03.834 --> 35:05.569
Where is she?

35:05.571 --> 35:07.237
Oh, don. I don't know.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.872
- Ok, Ok, Ok.
- She's not here.

35:11.342 --> 35:13.310
Call 911!

35:50.548 --> 35:52.716
Hey, hey, hey.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.584
Look, look...
Nobody's going to hurt you, Ok.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.853
You can scream all you want.
No one's going to hear you.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.256
Relax, relax.
Don't worry, breathe, breathe.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.924
- Forget this, man.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.026
He's not gonna hurt you, Ok?
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

36:03.028 --> 36:04.661
I know it seems crazy.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.503
It's Ok, relax.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.305
Come here. Come here.

36:21.412 --> 36:22.812
What the hell did you do to her?

36:22.814 --> 36:24.447
Chloroform, man.
I had a feeling we'd need that.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.049
Damn, what a brat.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.018
Billy, you can't keep her
unconscious a whole month.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.453
- She's just scared is all.
- She's just a pain in the ass

36:30.455 --> 36:33.456
is what she is.
Obviously her father's daughter.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.858
Poor girl, she's scared
she's been kidnapped

36:34.860 --> 36:35.992
by two crazy men in masks.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.627
Well, you know what?

36:37.629 --> 36:39.696
Maybe it'll be good for the kid,
toughen her up.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.399
Life isn't always going
to be this perfect,

36:42.401 --> 36:44.301
little bullshit
suburban fairy tale

36:44.303 --> 36:45.835
like she's been living.

36:45.837 --> 36:46.970
She's gonna have to learn.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.539
Life ain't fucking fair!

36:49.541 --> 36:51.308
It doesn't always turn
out like you thought.

36:59.317 --> 37:00.650
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.719
There's no finger prints.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.922
So what time was it, ma'am,
that you tucked Patty into bed?

37:05.924 --> 37:09.959
About 9:00,
we'd just had a big dinner,

37:09.961 --> 37:12.562
and everybody was
sort of in a food coma

37:12.564 --> 37:15.932
now my baby...
I can't believe she's missing.

37:18.102 --> 37:19.969
And where were you
at this time, sir?

37:19.971 --> 37:23.606
Oh. I was, uh, I had just eaten.

37:23.608 --> 37:25.408
I was getting ready for bed.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.910
I don't remember falling asleep.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.879
We had had Turkey with
all the trimmings, you know.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.916
And the tryptophan, I think,

37:32.918 --> 37:34.784
it like knocks you out,
you know,

37:34.786 --> 37:35.985
it's like Thanksgiving

37:35.987 --> 37:37.721
when everybody
just falls asleep.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.022
Patty loves her Turkey.

37:40.791 --> 37:44.394
Do either of you have any
enemies that you know of?

37:44.396 --> 37:46.429
Enemies?

37:46.431 --> 37:47.664
Any recent disputes?

37:49.133 --> 37:52.969
Uh, I don't know, you know?
I feel like...

37:52.971 --> 37:55.138
I feel like we're
pretty well-liked.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.774
- Yeah.
- I can be socially awkward.

37:59.043 --> 38:00.944
But that's just
more being quiet.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.545
I'm not a jerk.

38:02.547 --> 38:05.882
I feel like maybe
people don't like don

38:05.884 --> 38:08.752
but they don't say it?

38:08.754 --> 38:11.054
But I still don't feel like
they would do this to us.

38:12.556 --> 38:13.523
I agree.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.125
Yeah.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.861
What kind of goddamned psycho
does something like this?

38:18.963 --> 38:19.963
Oh, don.

38:21.065 --> 38:23.433
Why didn't you just wake up?

38:25.403 --> 38:27.163
- You could have done something.
- I'm sorry.

38:27.638 --> 38:28.872
I'm so sorry.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.140
What kind of pictures
do you think

38:30.142 --> 38:31.474
we should put out of Patty?

38:31.476 --> 38:33.777
Like a pageanty one or...

38:33.779 --> 38:35.111
Could I put out several?

38:35.113 --> 38:37.013
We pay lots of money for
the best photographers.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.715
We have great pictures of her.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.917
We go to Walmart
and really get it done.

38:47.091 --> 38:48.625
Oh, this is just great.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.560
Glad we can see the
people in the background

38:50.562 --> 38:51.761
because I don't
really want to see

38:51.763 --> 38:53.163
the interview subjects.

38:54.732 --> 38:56.599
Nancy, I need you
to cover a kidnapping

38:56.601 --> 38:57.634
that just came in.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.436
Yeah, right, a kidnapping.

38:59.438 --> 39:00.637
Do you want the story or not?

39:01.705 --> 39:02.639
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.040
What are the details?

39:04.042 --> 39:05.608
Ok, we don't know
much at this point,

39:05.610 --> 39:06.676
an 11-year-old girl
taken from her home

39:06.678 --> 39:07.944
in the middle of the night.

39:07.946 --> 39:08.945
Investigators
are at the house now.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.613
Well, is Matt ready?

39:10.615 --> 39:12.449
Because I'm only using
his team from now on.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.651
Yeah, they're waiting on you.
Don't blow this one!

39:15.686 --> 39:17.086
Does this work?

39:17.088 --> 39:18.621
If they're standing
at the front porch,

39:18.623 --> 39:20.123
can you get us all
in if we need to

39:20.125 --> 39:21.558
and in focus?

39:23.828 --> 39:25.161
You tired of working
with the B team?

39:25.163 --> 39:26.930
What good is it
to get an exclusive

39:26.932 --> 39:28.598
if it's not in focus.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.033
No national network's
going to pick that up.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.601
It's just a waste.

39:31.603 --> 39:32.902
Speaking of which,

39:32.904 --> 39:34.170
if you want to get
noticed by the big boys,

39:34.172 --> 39:35.672
you need to sex it up a little.

39:35.674 --> 39:36.940
Unbutton a couple of buttons,

39:36.942 --> 39:39.476
show some cleavage,
maybe some leg.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.144
Matt, I'm about to
interview the parents

39:41.146 --> 39:42.545
of a missing little girl.

39:43.747 --> 39:44.747
Sick.

39:47.084 --> 39:49.219
It couldn't hurt.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.855
Don't you think
we should get closer?

39:51.857 --> 39:52.922
You know?

39:54.058 --> 39:55.191
Oh, see.

39:55.193 --> 39:56.759
Is this what you wanted?

39:56.761 --> 39:57.794
Yeah, that looks good.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.162
Hold on.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.599
They look huge on camera.

40:03.634 --> 40:04.634
I know.

40:06.003 --> 40:08.171
There's nothing to worry
about here, folks.

40:08.173 --> 40:11.107
Sheriff Williams,
he's that good.

40:12.776 --> 40:13.776
The best.

40:15.946 --> 40:18.681
Did you talk to that
squirrelly guy next door,

40:18.683 --> 40:20.149
the one with the thick glasses?

40:20.151 --> 40:23.019
Oh, yeah. We interviewed
all the neighbors, sir.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.089
He was twitching.

40:26.091 --> 40:29.559
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's the biological father?

40:29.561 --> 40:32.729
- He's the biological father.
- I need coffee right now.

40:32.731 --> 40:34.130
Yes, sir, right away.

40:36.901 --> 40:38.535
I'm sorry.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.904
Excuse me, I didn't get
much sleep last night

40:40.906 --> 40:43.306
after the call
about your daughter,

40:43.308 --> 40:44.588
and it's been a really long day.

40:45.809 --> 40:47.610
Well, so sorry for
the inconvenience,

40:47.612 --> 40:49.546
but what is going on?

40:49.548 --> 40:51.080
Do you have anything
to tell us all?

40:51.082 --> 40:53.316
That's why it's important
that we put out

40:53.318 --> 40:54.851
a press statement right now.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.887
The earlier we get a
photo of her out there,

40:57.889 --> 40:59.856
the better the chances
are that we'll find her

40:59.858 --> 41:02.225
before something really bad...
Oh, my god! Thank you!

41:02.227 --> 41:04.827
- Just like you like it, chief.
- Oh, I love coffee.

41:04.829 --> 41:05.962
I'm an addict.

41:11.268 --> 41:12.936
There's a ton of
press out there.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.618
They're all waiting to
hear your statement.

41:15.573 --> 41:17.206
There's going to
be cameras rolling.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.309
Reporters are going
to be screaming at you

41:19.311 --> 41:20.944
asking you all
kinds of questions.

41:22.012 --> 41:23.346
You have to be ready.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.782
The attention can be
a bit overwhelming.

41:26.884 --> 41:29.018
In fact, if you're not up to it,

41:29.020 --> 41:30.853
I'd be happy to take
the reins on this.

41:30.855 --> 41:33.289
I've had a lot of experience
in front of the camera,

41:33.291 --> 41:36.793
and I'm a bit of a student
of the theater, so.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.595
Larson, here, he's
seen me in action.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.863
Oh, excellent actor.

41:40.865 --> 41:42.732
I did <i>noises off six months ago.</i>

41:42.734 --> 41:44.300
The local critic said
he would put me up against,

41:44.302 --> 41:46.903
uh, no, that won't be necessary.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.237
Thank you.

41:48.239 --> 41:49.772
We're fully prepared
to do anything

41:49.774 --> 41:51.608
that we need to do
to get our baby back.

41:51.610 --> 41:52.610
Yeah.

41:54.979 --> 41:56.846
Ok.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.115
All right.

42:17.067 --> 42:19.235
Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Wilson!

42:19.237 --> 42:20.903
This is don and Leanne Wilson.

42:20.905 --> 42:22.705
They'd like to make
a public statement.

42:29.713 --> 42:33.116
This is our darling
11-year-old daughter,

42:33.118 --> 42:34.118
Patty Wilson.

42:35.953 --> 42:37.286
She's the light of our lives.

42:39.790 --> 42:42.725
She was kidnapped from this home
in the middle of the night.

42:44.261 --> 42:46.863
I don't know how or why
anyone could be so evil.

42:48.932 --> 42:51.267
But we just want our baby back.

42:53.437 --> 42:56.105
She's such a sweet
and amazing girl.

42:56.107 --> 42:58.941
That's why we like to call
her our peppermint Patty.

43:02.247 --> 43:03.680
Oh, we pray with
all of our hearts

43:03.682 --> 43:06.349
that whoever has her,
wherever she is

43:06.351 --> 43:08.851
that they treat her
with dignity and respect

43:08.853 --> 43:10.687
because that's
what she deserves.

43:10.689 --> 43:14.757
<i>Please have mercy
and let our baby go.</i>

43:15.993 --> 43:17.727
She's good.

43:17.729 --> 43:20.196
<i>Please let her come home.</i>

43:23.100 --> 43:25.034
Wait, that's my mom.

43:25.036 --> 43:27.403
Oh, you scared
the hell out of me.

43:27.405 --> 43:29.338
<i>Thank you all for being here.</i>

43:29.340 --> 43:31.074
<i>We'll update you when
there is more information.</i>

43:31.076 --> 43:32.341
<i>That's all for now.</i>

43:32.343 --> 43:33.943
You shouldn't be watching this.

43:35.412 --> 43:36.846
Why'd you do this to me?

43:36.848 --> 43:38.214
We're not going to hurt you.

43:41.985 --> 43:43.953
You don't know,
you just gotta trust me.

43:46.323 --> 43:48.391
You're not going to get
anything for me.

43:48.393 --> 43:50.159
My parents don't
even have any money.

43:50.161 --> 43:51.761
We didn't abduct you for money.

43:53.797 --> 43:54.997
Then why am I here?

43:57.101 --> 43:58.434
I'm not supposed to
talk about with you.

43:58.436 --> 43:59.869
Then why are you doing this?

44:01.004 --> 44:02.739
I can't talk to you about it.

44:02.741 --> 44:03.840
You should just stop
asking questions.

44:03.842 --> 44:05.241
Fine.

44:05.243 --> 44:07.376
I'll remember that when
they throw away the key.

44:07.378 --> 44:11.380
You're gonna be fine, Ok?
That's all I can tell you.

44:13.450 --> 44:15.752
- I know that woman.
- Seriously?

44:15.754 --> 44:17.453
Yep. I went
to high school with her.

44:17.455 --> 44:19.522
She's what they call
nowadays a mean girl.

44:19.524 --> 44:21.224
That woman made
my life miserable.

44:22.861 --> 44:25.528
Uh oh, were you like
the annoying overachiever,

44:25.530 --> 44:27.263
and she was the hot,
popular girl?

44:27.265 --> 44:29.866
No, I wasn't...
You know what, shut up.

44:29.868 --> 44:32.802
- That's so rude.
- Ok, Ok.

44:32.804 --> 44:34.871
How did she make
your life a living hell?

44:34.873 --> 44:36.439
Well, you're slightly
on the right track,

44:36.441 --> 44:38.474
I mean, she was our
school's queen bee, right,

44:38.476 --> 44:41.444
I mean, gorgeous,
popular, cheerleader,

44:41.446 --> 44:44.247
homecoming queen, prom queen,
any other queen we had.

44:45.482 --> 44:47.550
So are you like
the disgruntled one,

44:47.552 --> 44:49.852
always a bridesmaid
never a bride?

44:49.854 --> 44:53.389
No, I mean I was an
outstanding student, obviously.

44:53.391 --> 44:56.959
Yeah, I was head of
our yearbook committee

44:56.961 --> 44:58.561
and newspaper editor.

44:58.563 --> 45:00.830
I was vice president
of the senior class.

45:00.832 --> 45:02.098
That was great.

45:02.100 --> 45:04.066
I had to get votes for that.

45:04.068 --> 45:05.334
So a giant dork.

45:06.503 --> 45:07.804
I hate you.

45:10.440 --> 45:11.800
You know I'm just
messing with you?

45:12.810 --> 45:13.810
Finish your story.

45:16.147 --> 45:18.881
She made fun of me
in front of everyone.

45:18.883 --> 45:20.249
She called me nerdy Nancy.

45:21.853 --> 45:24.453
And that caught on
like wildfire, of course.

45:24.455 --> 45:26.355
It's all just because
in ninth-grade English,

45:26.357 --> 45:28.391
I slightly questioned
her book report

45:28.393 --> 45:30.827
that she was reading
to the class.

45:30.829 --> 45:32.461
From then on, she made
it her life's mission

45:32.463 --> 45:34.263
to ruin mine.

45:34.265 --> 45:36.532
She's just such an evil bitch.

45:38.969 --> 45:40.970
You do recall
that this poor woman

45:40.972 --> 45:43.172
is looking for
her missing child.

45:43.174 --> 45:46.042
Yeah, and I feel
terrible for them,

45:46.044 --> 45:47.977
and I'm going to be
all over this story,

45:47.979 --> 45:49.312
and do everything I can.

45:51.281 --> 45:52.915
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

45:54.318 --> 45:56.018
Just spread the word
on the streets.

45:56.020 --> 45:57.520
It's horrible.

45:57.522 --> 45:59.455
I can't believe this
happened in our community.

45:59.457 --> 46:01.591
I mean, oh, my god,

46:01.593 --> 46:03.893
I have four kids.

46:03.895 --> 46:05.394
We live here,
we go to school here...

46:06.630 --> 46:08.297
Excuse me, have
you seen this girl?

46:08.299 --> 46:09.866
She's been missing
for a few days.

46:11.001 --> 46:12.368
We've got nothing right now,

46:13.503 --> 46:15.104
and we're digging hard.

46:16.173 --> 46:18.941
These guys are professionals.

46:18.943 --> 46:21.210
They're good. They're hot.
They know what they're doing.

46:21.212 --> 46:23.312
Hoo-wee!

46:23.314 --> 46:25.081
I'm sure glad you chose pancakes

46:25.083 --> 46:28.050
because I do make
a mean flapjack.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.425
See how you're
feeling after this.

46:38.562 --> 46:39.562
Dig in.

46:41.164 --> 46:43.132
How can I eat these
with my hands tied?

46:45.135 --> 46:47.236
Ok.

46:47.238 --> 46:50.106
All right I'm gonna untie you,
but don't try nothing. Ok?

46:51.375 --> 46:52.575
You can't get out
of here no ways.

46:52.577 --> 46:54.677
This place is secure
like fort Knox,

46:54.679 --> 46:56.178
and you do not want
to be wandering around

46:56.180 --> 46:58.047
out here in this wilderness.

46:58.049 --> 47:00.683
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Wild animals and such out there.

47:00.685 --> 47:02.585
You remember what happened
to little red riding hood.

47:02.587 --> 47:03.653
What?

47:06.690 --> 47:07.924
Ok, me neither.

47:09.426 --> 47:11.694
Oh, you about to be happy now.

47:13.263 --> 47:15.164
Probably be the best
flapjacks you ever had.

47:16.500 --> 47:17.860
Let me do a little
of that for you.

47:19.369 --> 47:21.504
Whoops.

47:23.240 --> 47:26.075
Wait, you're not trying to
drug me again, are you?

47:26.077 --> 47:28.210
What do you mean?
I'm eating it with you.

47:29.446 --> 47:32.448
Look, bill...
Er, Bo only did that

47:32.450 --> 47:35.184
because you were screaming
and freaking out.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.086
He was trying to help you.
He was trying to calm you down.

47:37.088 --> 47:38.421
Gee, how nice of him.

47:38.423 --> 47:41.324
Just take one bite
of the flapjack.

47:41.326 --> 47:42.391
You'll feel loads better.

47:43.727 --> 47:44.727
Go ahead.

47:52.235 --> 47:53.235
Mmm!

47:54.571 --> 47:57.974
- These are really good!
- See, I told you.

47:57.976 --> 47:59.008
You can trust me.

48:02.112 --> 48:03.512
Well, isn't this nice?

48:05.515 --> 48:07.683
A little breakfast
for dinner, huh?

48:07.685 --> 48:10.019
I made a ton.
Go and grab a plate.

48:10.021 --> 48:11.420
No, I'm good.

48:11.422 --> 48:13.990
Just came to check on
our little Princess.

48:15.092 --> 48:16.459
I see you stopped shrieking.

48:19.497 --> 48:22.198
Whoo, she's a firecracker, huh?

48:22.200 --> 48:23.666
Probably going to be
just like her momma,

48:23.668 --> 48:26.035
- little heartbreaker.
- Wait, you know my mom?

48:26.037 --> 48:28.504
Do I know your momma?
I used to...

48:31.274 --> 48:33.209
I mean, of course,
I know of your momma.

48:35.145 --> 48:37.079
We did do our proper
research and what not.

48:37.081 --> 48:38.547
I'm not freaking amateurs.

48:38.549 --> 48:41.584
Hey, why don't you have
some flapjacks with us?

48:41.586 --> 48:43.552
- Come on, Bo.
- Bo?

48:45.255 --> 48:46.255
Um... uh...

48:47.290 --> 48:48.691
Uh, no, Luke.

48:48.693 --> 48:51.160
I can't stay.
I gotta get back to work.

48:51.162 --> 48:52.695
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.

48:52.697 --> 48:54.697
All right, you know where
the chloroform is, right?

48:54.699 --> 48:57.400
You tie her back up,
you understand me.

48:57.402 --> 48:58.402
As soon as we eat.

48:59.469 --> 49:00.636
Bye, Princess.

49:38.241 --> 49:40.142
- Hello?
- Hey.

49:40.144 --> 49:41.677
Oh, god, I miss
you so much, baby,

49:41.679 --> 49:43.612
I can't concentrate.
I gotta see you.

49:43.614 --> 49:45.114
Are you crazy?

49:45.116 --> 49:46.148
You shouldn't be
calling me right now.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.583
<i>No, it's Ok.</i>

49:47.585 --> 49:48.751
I'm calling from a pay
phone like you said.

49:48.753 --> 49:50.586
I need to see you.

49:50.588 --> 49:54.190
What part of no communication
unless absolutely necessary

49:54.192 --> 49:57.193
do you not understand?
This is really stupid.

49:57.195 --> 49:58.394
Well, how the hell long
do we gotta go

49:58.396 --> 50:00.496
without seeing each other, huh?

50:00.498 --> 50:02.832
I keep seeing you on the news.
You're looking so hot.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.567
<i>It's killing me.</i>

50:04.569 --> 50:06.869
I told you a month,
and it's only been a week,

50:06.871 --> 50:08.604
so don't call me unless
it's an emergency.

50:11.842 --> 50:13.476
Are you not missing me at all?

50:14.711 --> 50:16.612
Oh, baby, of course, I miss you.

50:16.614 --> 50:18.314
I miss you like crazy.

50:18.316 --> 50:20.116
I'm just, you know,
a little on edge

50:20.118 --> 50:22.351
<i>because I don't wanna
screw things up.</i>

50:22.353 --> 50:23.819
Oh, Billy, we're
gonna be so happy

50:23.821 --> 50:25.321
when this is all over.

50:25.323 --> 50:26.455
<i>I know we are, baby.</i>

50:26.457 --> 50:28.457
I'm sorry. I'm a fucking idiot.

50:29.759 --> 50:31.894
- I gotta get going, but, uh...
<i>- Wait.</i>

50:31.896 --> 50:32.895
I love you.

50:32.897 --> 50:35.397
How is the little bunny rabbit?

50:37.501 --> 50:39.401
- It's fine.
- Happy to hear that.

50:39.403 --> 50:40.603
<i>- She's doing good.
- Who are you talking to?</i>

50:40.605 --> 50:41.871
<i>- I said I...
- Police?</i>

50:43.140 --> 50:44.140
Yeah.

50:52.582 --> 50:54.550
What'd they say?
Any good news?

50:56.386 --> 50:57.853
No.

50:57.855 --> 50:58.888
God damn it!

50:59.923 --> 51:01.457
Nearly a week and nothing.

51:02.492 --> 51:03.492
Amazing.

51:07.465 --> 51:08.631
Uh-oh.

51:08.633 --> 51:10.733
Uh-oh.

51:10.735 --> 51:12.735
Earnhardt Jr.'s coming up.

51:12.737 --> 51:14.803
In a second, Jimmie Giles
is gonna eat my dust,

51:14.805 --> 51:16.172
come on.

51:20.710 --> 51:22.278
Come on, come on.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.280
Woo-hoo!

51:24.381 --> 51:25.541
I told you I'd win this time.

51:26.550 --> 51:29.351
You learn fast, young Skywalker.

51:29.353 --> 51:30.586
Huh?

51:30.588 --> 51:32.922
Oh, never mind,
it was before your time.

51:36.226 --> 51:37.927
How long am I gonna be here?

51:42.832 --> 51:45.267
I don't know. Not long.

51:47.404 --> 51:48.671
Sorry, kid.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.339
Yeah, well...

51:50.341 --> 51:52.308
I do miss my parents
and everything,

51:52.310 --> 51:55.744
but it's actually kind of nice
to have a break from my life.

51:55.746 --> 51:57.479
Really?

51:57.481 --> 51:59.915
Yeah, it's the most downtime
I've ever had.

51:59.917 --> 52:02.651
Downtime?

52:02.653 --> 52:04.787
You're a kid.
What do you know about downtime?

52:04.789 --> 52:06.488
Well, let's see.

52:06.490 --> 52:09.992
So I go to school
at seven o'clock,

52:09.994 --> 52:11.627
and by the time I come out
at two,

52:11.629 --> 52:15.331
I have either dance class,
show rehearsal,

52:15.333 --> 52:18.567
um, acting classes
or singing lessons,

52:18.569 --> 52:20.869
and then most days,
I have two classes back to back.

52:20.871 --> 52:23.639
So that means I come home
around seven-ish.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.975
Then it's dinner, homework,

52:25.977 --> 52:27.943
and my mom hounding me
to practice with her

52:27.945 --> 52:29.712
until I'm ready to pass out.

52:29.714 --> 52:31.413
Oh, and let's not forget

52:31.415 --> 52:34.316
all of the never ending
competitions and pageants

52:34.318 --> 52:36.018
I have the pleasure
of being forced to do.

52:36.020 --> 52:37.453
Oh.

52:37.455 --> 52:39.421
Your mom's one of those moms.

52:40.690 --> 52:42.291
She means well, I guess.

52:43.560 --> 52:44.727
When do you see your friends?

52:46.663 --> 52:48.364
Well, friends?

52:48.366 --> 52:49.765
No, friends aren't
in the schedule.

52:51.534 --> 52:54.603
Yeah, I don't have
many friends either.

52:54.605 --> 52:56.839
It's nice to play this game
with somebody,

52:56.841 --> 52:59.842
you know, other than
the damn computer.

52:59.844 --> 53:01.377
Yeah, of course,

53:01.379 --> 53:03.846
but why don't you
have any friends?

53:03.848 --> 53:07.016
I guess I'm just
uncomfortable around people.

53:08.451 --> 53:09.585
How 'bout your family?

53:13.590 --> 53:14.990
Hi, boys and girls.

53:14.992 --> 53:16.358
Hey, man.

53:23.600 --> 53:27.970
How's it going here
at, uh, Shangri-la?

53:27.972 --> 53:29.705
We're just playing the x-box,

53:29.707 --> 53:31.707
and she beat me.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.709
Oh, and can you pick up
a copy of star wars?

53:33.711 --> 53:35.411
Can you believe
she's never seen it?

53:35.413 --> 53:37.079
Well, it's like
a million years old.

53:37.081 --> 53:40.482
It doesn't matter.
It's a classic. No excuse.

53:42.852 --> 53:44.019
Bo.

53:45.789 --> 53:48.357
No, I ain't getting you
no friggin' star wars.

53:50.760 --> 53:52.528
<i>Don and I are cooperating fully.</i>

53:54.431 --> 53:56.498
<i>I completely support
the police investigating</i>

53:56.500 --> 53:58.067
<i>all possibilities.</i>

54:00.837 --> 54:03.505
<i>I need to be honest
for a minute, Claire.</i>

54:03.507 --> 54:05.507
<i>I'm not who people think I am.</i>

54:07.477 --> 54:10.479
<i>I'm acting brave,
but I'm really just a coward.</i>

54:10.481 --> 54:12.381
<i>And I miss my baby so much.</i>

54:12.383 --> 54:14.483
<i>And I know
I've been acting strong and...</i>

54:14.485 --> 54:16.552
<i>This has been very
hard on you and don,</i>

54:16.554 --> 54:18.587
<i>I... I'm sure.</i>

54:18.589 --> 54:20.055
<i>Can somebody get
her some Kleenex?</i>

54:24.094 --> 54:25.627
<i>Look at her.</i>

54:25.629 --> 54:26.862
<i>That's my baby.</i>

54:28.698 --> 54:31.834
<i>She's an amazing singer,
and a dancer and...</i>

54:31.836 --> 54:34.470
<i>She should be a model.</i>

54:34.472 --> 54:36.805
<i>We don't want her
to grow up too fast.</i>

54:36.807 --> 54:38.807
<i>We try to keep her home,
you know.</i>

54:38.809 --> 54:41.577
<i>She's just like
a little Meryl Streep.</i>

54:41.579 --> 54:43.779
<i>She has so much talent.</i>

54:45.515 --> 54:48.150
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

54:48.152 --> 54:49.651
<i>- It's going to be Ok.
- Thank you.</i>

54:49.653 --> 54:51.053
<i>It's going to be Ok.</i>

54:51.055 --> 54:53.622
<i>I didn't expect
that to happen. Sorry.</i>

54:53.624 --> 54:56.058
<i>If anybody
knows anything, sees anything,</i>

54:56.060 --> 54:59.661
<i>please contact
your local police,</i>

54:59.663 --> 55:02.431
<i>we want to help Leanne
and don bring Patty home.</i>

55:02.433 --> 55:03.699
<i>Thank you for listening.</i>

55:09.072 --> 55:10.739
<i>It's been seven days now</i>

55:10.741 --> 55:12.674
<i>that 11-year-old Patty
Wilson was abducted</i>

55:12.676 --> 55:14.610
<i>from her Hancock
neighborhood home,</i>

55:14.612 --> 55:15.611
<i>but the community
has not given up hope</i>

55:15.613 --> 55:17.446
<i>for her safe return</i>

55:17.448 --> 55:20.849
<i>as dozens of people came
to quail creek park today</i>

55:20.851 --> 55:23.952
<i>to show their love and support
for her and her family.</i>

55:23.954 --> 55:25.854
<i>This next song's
for Patty Wilson.</i>

55:25.856 --> 55:27.589
<i>We miss you
and hope you come home soon.</i>

55:27.591 --> 55:29.425
<i>Gathered around local musicians,</i>

55:29.427 --> 55:32.694
<i>the tiara girls,
it was an emotional night</i>

55:32.696 --> 55:35.464
<i>as members of the community
gathered to light candles</i>

55:35.466 --> 55:36.999
<i>and pray for Patty Wilson.</i>

55:37.001 --> 55:39.802
<i>So far, the FBI
and local authorities</i>

55:39.804 --> 55:41.570
<i>have not reported any leads,</i>

55:41.572 --> 55:43.872
<i>however, the search
has intensified</i>

55:43.874 --> 55:46.909
<i>as dozens of local residents
have scoured the area</i>

56:44.567 --> 56:46.101
hey!

56:46.103 --> 56:48.570
- Still obsessing?
- Don't do that.

56:48.572 --> 56:49.972
What's the latest?

56:49.974 --> 56:51.640
Absolutely nothing.

56:51.642 --> 56:55.077
There's no finger prints,
no DNA, no leads.

56:55.079 --> 56:56.645
But she's certainly
making the rounds.

56:58.147 --> 57:01.283
Yeah, 'cause she's
trying to find her kid.

57:01.285 --> 57:03.218
No, the police are
trying to find her kid.

57:03.220 --> 57:05.554
There's nothing new to report
to the media.

57:05.556 --> 57:07.289
Yeah, but maybe she's, you know,

57:07.291 --> 57:09.258
hoping the kidnappers
will see her on TV,

57:09.260 --> 57:10.759
feel bad, and let her kid go.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.027
Oh, that's a great strategy.

57:12.029 --> 57:13.262
That always works.

57:13.264 --> 57:14.963
Ok, I see your point.

57:14.965 --> 57:15.964
I don't know.
This story's starting

57:15.966 --> 57:17.699
to pick up national steam though

57:17.701 --> 57:19.535
because Patty's one of those
child pageant stars.

57:19.537 --> 57:21.069
Oh, yeah.

57:21.071 --> 57:24.106
Every station is flashing
an old pageant glamor shot

57:24.108 --> 57:26.942
of the poor girl when she was,
like, seven years old.

57:26.944 --> 57:28.110
How's that helping?

57:28.112 --> 57:30.112
It's disgusting.

57:30.114 --> 57:33.882
The media, the press,
they are disgusting.

57:33.884 --> 57:36.151
I mean, if only
they were as honorable

57:36.153 --> 57:37.753
and conscientious as you are,

57:37.755 --> 57:39.275
then the world would
be a better place.

57:40.757 --> 57:43.926
- Thank you, I think.
- Mm-hmm.

57:43.928 --> 57:46.094
Or f you.

57:46.096 --> 57:47.229
Thank you or f you.

57:47.231 --> 57:48.231
I never know.

57:51.135 --> 57:53.802
Something tells me Leanne's
not going to be complaining.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.737
God knows she was

57:55.739 --> 57:58.106
an attention whore
in high school.

57:58.108 --> 58:02.144
Ok, uh, have fun obsessing,
and I'll see you later.

58:02.146 --> 58:04.179
- Order lunch.
- Sure what do you want?

58:04.181 --> 58:07.082
- Tacos, spicy.
- No. No.

58:07.084 --> 58:08.850
- I want 'em spicy.
- No.

58:08.852 --> 58:09.851
Handle it.

58:09.853 --> 58:10.886
- No.
- Handle it.

58:10.888 --> 58:12.054
I'm getting you soup.

58:12.056 --> 58:13.355
No!

58:17.860 --> 58:19.361
Ok now you try to do the...

58:19.363 --> 58:21.263
You know, the clap,

58:21.265 --> 58:22.598
and I'll do...

58:22.600 --> 58:23.665
Ok.

58:25.268 --> 58:26.935
- One, two
- three, four.

58:30.807 --> 58:32.074
Whoa!

58:32.076 --> 58:33.076
Ooh, ouch.

58:35.878 --> 58:38.647
Oh, gosh, I can't believe
girls do this.

58:38.649 --> 58:39.982
What?

58:39.984 --> 58:42.117
Girls rock at this.

58:42.119 --> 58:43.599
Come on, I'll show
you something else.

58:45.121 --> 58:47.155
This is called
the sleeper hold, Ok.

58:47.157 --> 58:48.657
Turn around like this.

58:48.659 --> 58:49.825
You feel this forearm
right there?

58:49.827 --> 58:51.627
- Mm-hmm.
- Ok, feel my head.

58:51.629 --> 58:52.961
- Mm-hmm.
- Now watch this.

58:56.867 --> 58:58.667
Here, now you try it, come on.

58:58.669 --> 59:00.869
- Ok.
- Ok.

59:00.871 --> 59:03.071
- Like that?
- Like that, that's right.

59:03.073 --> 59:06.174
- And like this.
- Yeah, Ok.

59:06.176 --> 59:07.416
There you go, now. That's good.

59:08.946 --> 59:10.746
How come you're not sleeping?

59:10.748 --> 59:12.247
It'd take about five of you
at your strength

59:12.249 --> 59:13.815
to put my big ass to sleep,

59:13.817 --> 59:15.817
- so you need some strength.
- Not really.

59:15.819 --> 59:16.885
Some actual...

59:31.801 --> 59:34.336
It's cool.
We're friends now, right?

59:34.338 --> 59:35.671
Yeah, we're friends now.

59:40.044 --> 59:42.377
This is such a violation.

59:42.379 --> 59:44.980
That's our beautiful home
that we made together.

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:06.168
Jammies, pink Jammies.
Princess Jammies.

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:07.836
They were yellow, don.

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.006
He never pays attention to her.

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:16.111
What about frank
and all the neighbors

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:18.146
coming over, and bringing us
all that stuff?

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:19.448
That was really nice.

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:26.888
Who is it?

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:28.490
I don't know.
I don't recognize the number.

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:29.812
Probably just
another news outlet.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.328
Who might have
information for us, babe.

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.030
Just... just get it.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.302
Hello?

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:42.738
Well, you two are looking
pretty fucking cozy.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.106
Oh, no thank you.

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:45.474
- Now's not a good time.
- Oh, no.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:49.010
You're sitting next to
that fucker, aren't you?

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:50.912
You put that
limp-dick bastard on.

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:53.381
Put him on!
Hey, fucker, hey fucker!

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.417
I don't want any.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:01:01.790
You need to meet me tomorrow
at the rendezvous point at noon,

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.125
and you better be there.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.531
Telemarketers.

01:01:09.533 --> 01:01:11.433
Unbelievable.

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:22.978
<i>Amber is slapping
fives with with her fans,</i>

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.179
<i>getting the crowd...</i>

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.848
How do you know
all this wrestling?

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.517
Um, I was kind of a loner

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:30.118
when I was younger,

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.521
so I used to watch
a lot of wrestling on TV,

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:33.555
probably too much.

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:35.123
That must be nice,

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:38.293
like, sitting around,
chilling, watch TV.

01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:40.162
Oh, if I did that,
my mom would have a cow.

01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:42.063
Hmm.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:45.100
You're mom may bug you,
but I'm sure she's just doing

01:01:45.102 --> 01:01:47.235
what she thinks is best.

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:49.518
I can't even remember my mom.
She took off when I was two.

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:52.440
You lucky to have
so many people in your life

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:53.475
that care about you.

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.346
Is that your keyboard?

01:01:59.448 --> 01:02:00.482
Uh-huh

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:02.083
oh.

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:07.022
Well, do you play it?

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:09.825
Not lately, but yeah.

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:13.895
Cool, like, are you any good?

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:17.098
Geez. I started
when I was about your age.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.201
- Really?
- My grandmama taught me.

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:22.904
- Wait.
- Yeah, I got a grandmama.

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:29.377
Ok, everybody has a grandmama.

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:33.381
Since nobody was ever home
at my place,

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:35.116
I'd go over there
as much as I could.

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:37.219
She didn't have much,
but she had this old piano

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:39.054
that she played all the time.

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:40.522
She wanted me to learn,

01:02:40.524 --> 01:02:42.190
and I didn't want
no parts of it,

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:46.895
so she bribed me with, like,
chocolate and ding dongs

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:49.464
and bologna sandwiches,

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:51.299
and she gave me lessons.

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:55.170
At some point, I started
to actually liking it.

01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:57.038
And then I got pretty good.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.407
It came to the point
where I would go over there

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:00.489
just to jump on that piano.

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:04.546
Well, you know
I play the violin?

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:06.414
The violin? You play that, too?

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:09.184
You see it's not one of my
mother-approved activities.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.656
My dad let's me play though.
He thinks it's pretty awesome.

01:03:14.658 --> 01:03:15.658
Well, it is.

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:17.893
I love it.

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:20.595
Maybe we can play
together some day.

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:24.599
Maybe we will.

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.130
You're late.

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:58.066
Didn't think
you were gonna show.

01:03:58.068 --> 01:03:59.401
I had to at least
go in and buy something,

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:01.336
so I don't look
so damned suspicious.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.338
This is super risky, you know.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.173
Everybody in town
knows who I am now.

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:09.044
Give me a hug, and look like
you're consoling me,

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:10.206
like you just bumped into me.

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:19.287
Oh, you reek like booze.
Put on something new.

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.224
That's the most damn action
I've gotten from you

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:24.626
since this whole thing started.

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:27.095
What do you expect?
We talked about this.

01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:30.999
I'm just not so sure
about all this anymore.

01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:34.302
What? Oh, baby,
how could you say that?

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.071
I sure as shit
don't like seeing you

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:37.639
and your scumbag husband
all over each other

01:04:37.641 --> 01:04:40.075
on every damned TV station.

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:42.177
And I'm about fucking done
with being hung up on it.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:43.478
Well, I don't want to
take any stupid chances

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.546
right now, Ok?

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:45.613
You should be happy.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.415
I'm getting a lot of publicity.

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:48.616
It's exactly like we planned.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.019
No, exactly like you planned.

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:52.187
So, what, you're just gonna

01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:53.555
keep soaking up
all the publicity

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.423
while I wait around
doing your dirty work

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:57.125
like a... like a little bitch?

01:04:57.127 --> 01:04:59.160
You are doing
the most important part.

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:01.262
You're taking care
of my little girl.

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:03.098
You're doing it for us,
don't forget.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.433
I'm going crazy, baby.

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:08.103
I need to be with you.
I... I need you.

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:10.038
Hey!

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.306
Ok.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:13.074
Remember when we planned to meet

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.377
after the homecoming game
at that old abandoned barn?

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:17.112
Oh, yeah.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.180
You remember how long
we had to wait to be together?

01:05:19.182 --> 01:05:20.582
We had to wait through classes,

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.317
and we had to wait through
the football game,

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:23.651
and we had to wait through
the ceremony.

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.320
Hmm... king and queen.

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:26.488
King and queen.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:27.655
Remember how good
it actually felt

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.224
after all that anticipation

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:31.126
when we finally
got to be together?

01:05:31.128 --> 01:05:33.361
It was the most
mind-blowing night of our lives.

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:35.163
How could I forget?

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:40.402
Think of it like that.
This is all just foreplay.

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:43.705
Ok, I promise you.
I will make it worth your while.

01:05:43.707 --> 01:05:45.206
- Hmm.
- Hey!

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:50.512
Psst. Hey!

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:52.614
How is she?

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.416
She's a little pain in the ass.

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:56.418
Hey, don't you talk about
my little girl like that.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.820
You better be good
to her, Billy.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:00.555
As long as you're good to me.

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:06.694
Nice to see you.

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:14.736
Leanne milling
and Billy Fontaine,

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.472
that can't be good.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:33.321
Oh.

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.623
Life has not been
good to you, sir.

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.510
You know what, sweetie,

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.178
that's actually my cup,
and this is my seat,

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.613
but you're gonna sit
right over there.

01:06:58.615 --> 01:06:59.881
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:00.882
That's Ok, go on.

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:02.517
Yep.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.319
I didn't do it.
Would you look at right there?

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.820
I feel like there's something
right there going on.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:07.455
Hang on one second.

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:08.823
I don't want you to be
nervous or anything, Ok?

01:07:08.825 --> 01:07:09.858
Thank you.

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:10.860
Thank you, Jenny.

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.696
Oh, you're so skinny.

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:24.405
Ok, great.
Got it, thank you.

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:27.675
Hey, Jenny, uh,
we're back in three, two...

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:29.544
Ok, great. You ready?

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:34.382
And we're back.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:36.918
Hi, welcome back to <i>Jenny.</i>

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.754
Our next guest is someone
that has been in my heart,

01:07:39.756 --> 01:07:41.189
I know,

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:42.824
and I think she has been
in the hearts

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:44.659
of everyone in this nation.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.676
Oh, finally. Oh, I'm starving.

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:03.411
Yeah, it was a crazy line.

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:05.680
At good and fast?

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:08.316
Hmm, I had to make a stop.

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:10.752
Where'd you go?

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:11.953
Hmm...

01:08:14.823 --> 01:08:15.890
What's behind your back?

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:17.926
What do you mean?

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.495
Oh, this?

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:21.529
No!

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.669
Now don't get too excited.

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:31.538
It's used and pretty beat up,
but it was the best I could do.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:33.274
I can't believe you did this.

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.911
Here you go.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.680
I'm sorry it's not new.

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:40.715
I love it. Thank you.

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:47.354
What you waiting on?
Play something.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:49.624
No.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.392
What do you mean no?

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:52.727
Do you know where I had to go
to find that?

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:55.330
Well, not unless you play, too.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.468
No, I'm real rusty.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.438
Well, listen, you kidnapped me,

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.240
so I think you owe me one.

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:26.761
Wow!

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:42.042
Hey, Bo, man,
we're playing some music.

01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:43.478
- You gotta hear us, man.
- It's really cool.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.679
It goes like this.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.720
What the fuck is this, JT?

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:58.893
- JT? Who is JT?
- No, fuck that shit!

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:00.862
The fuck's it even
matter anymore?

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:04.465
You took your fucking mask off!
I mean, why don't you just

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:07.869
dial 911 for her
while you're at it?

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:11.039
It's cool, man. She... she's cool.
We're friends now.

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:13.775
Friends? Are you shitting me?

01:10:13.777 --> 01:10:15.910
The little brat's
playing you, man.

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:17.512
And what about me, huh?

01:10:17.514 --> 01:10:18.579
What the fuck's
going to stop her

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:20.381
from ratting me out?

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:23.785
Huh? And what if something slips
and she reveals it about you

01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:25.553
because you were stupid enough

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.955
to give her your mug shot
on a silver fucking platter.

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.624
Who do you think she's going
to throw under the bus then?

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:30.958
Shut up!

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.361
Don't you back
talk me, little girl.

01:10:33.363 --> 01:10:34.362
- Who?
- He's right.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:35.663
We are friends,

01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:37.031
and I would never
get him in trouble.

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:38.566
You look more and more
like your daddy

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.767
every time I see you.

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:41.102
Wait, you know my dad?

01:10:41.104 --> 01:10:43.771
Yeah, I know
the limp-dick loser,

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.840
- and I'll tell you what...
- He's the best dad ever!

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:48.076
Not some scumbag kidnapper
like you!

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:54.482
Oh, my god,
I'm so sorry. Are you Ok?

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:55.817
I'm Ok. I'm Ok.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:56.819
The fuck!

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:01.022
I'm going to tell you
this one time, Billy.

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:02.890
If you ever touch
that child again,

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:04.492
I'm going to beat you
to a fucking pulp.

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:05.526
The fucker's mouthing off.

01:11:05.528 --> 01:11:07.595
She's just a kid!

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.731
And you got something
against her, I know it.

01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:11.733
So you just leave your
damn hands off of her.

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:13.468
This wasn't part of the plan.

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.103
Her mother find out,
she'll kill you.

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:17.972
Great.

01:11:19.007 --> 01:11:20.074
My mother?

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:23.978
Oh, god.

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:26.547
I'm so sorry.

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:31.486
There you go.
We're all fucked now!

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:32.488
Where you going?

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:35.757
Billy!

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:46.768
I can not believe
they cut the best part

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:48.903
out of our dateline segment.

01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:50.872
How could they not show
all Patty's trophies

01:11:50.874 --> 01:11:53.508
and what an amazing girl she is?

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:54.910
I can't believe
it's been this long,

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:59.180
what are the police
doing on this?

01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:01.783
Besides sleepwalking
through the investigation.

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:05.052
You know what we need?
We need Oprah.

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:06.854
Nobody gets more viewers
than Oprah.

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:09.924
Are you serious?

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:14.529
Yeah, what?

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:16.030
Who fucking cares about Oprah?

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:17.432
You know our daughter
has been gone

01:12:17.434 --> 01:12:18.733
for almost a month,

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:20.067
and we're no closer
to finding her

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:21.502
then we were a month ago.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.204
Don, calm down, Ok?

01:12:23.206 --> 01:12:25.173
We are trying to help the police
the best way we can.

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:27.108
All the exposure
is good for her.

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:28.776
Oh, all the exposure, yeah.

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:30.044
The exposure's been great.

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:31.846
All the exposure's
done is make us

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.014
into a fucking spectacle.

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:36.117
What do you want
to do, don, huh?

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:39.554
We're not the FBI.

01:12:39.556 --> 01:12:41.522
We can't just
go around investigating.

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.305
This is the only
thing that we can do.

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:48.563
Honey, the people
who committed this crime

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:51.566
have no soul, no humanity.

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.502
If the cops find them,

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:55.670
they better fucking fry them.

01:12:57.239 --> 01:12:59.240
Because if they don't,
I'm going to find them

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:02.109
and fucking tear
their fucking hearts out,

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:06.047
and then rip them limb from limb
with my fucking bare hands!

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.619
Come here.

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:20.661
I'm sorry, baby.

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:24.665
No, I'm sorry.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:06.974
That lying bitch.

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:25.026
- Hello, handsome.
- Cut the shit, Leanne.

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:27.194
You really thought you were just
going to play me for a fool,

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.696
and then toss me aside?

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.565
Use me and then live
happily ever after

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:32.166
with your stupid-ass husband?

01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:34.769
You're still the same
selfish bitch you always were,

01:14:34.771 --> 01:14:36.170
but, woman,
you are out of your mind

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:37.305
if you think
I'm going to let you

01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:38.739
fuck me over twice.

01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:40.174
So you know what, this time,

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:42.577
it ain't going down that way.

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:45.279
I'm thinking of paying
sheriff Williams a visit.

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:48.783
Sit him down and let him know
that little Patty Wilson

01:14:48.785 --> 01:14:51.352
was kidnapped
by her own goddamned mother!

01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:55.056
You got nothing
to say about that?

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:56.290
Oh, you think
you're gonna turn me in

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:59.093
and walk away unscathed, huh?

01:14:59.095 --> 01:15:01.862
Well, then you must be the same
dipshit you always were.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.731
I'll tell you this.
If I'm going down,

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:05.866
you better believe
you're going right down with me.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:08.002
Better yet, I got another idea.

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.870
Why don't I just let you take
the fall for the whole thing?

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:11.639
Yeah, I think that works better.

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:13.841
As a matter of fact,
who's going to possibly believe

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.242
an ex-con over little old me,

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:16.344
and I'm going to put on
such a show,

01:15:16.346 --> 01:15:17.612
you won't believe it.

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:19.246
For the cops and for the jury.

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:21.649
You better get ready to say hi
to your old prison buddies.

01:15:30.892 --> 01:15:32.994
You know none of this
really matters anyway

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:35.963
because that little
brat of yours,

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:37.632
she knows you're involved.

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:40.201
What?

01:15:40.203 --> 01:15:41.936
Yeah, that's what I came here
to tell you.

01:15:41.938 --> 01:15:45.373
- What?
- Yup, the gig is up sweetheart.

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:47.074
She'll probably throw
the book at all of us.

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:48.876
- Billy...
- Or you know what,

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.912
come to think of it,
I got a better idea.

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:54.081
Maybe I'll just dispose
of the evidence,

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:56.083
and then there won't be
proof of anything.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.885
- Yeah, I like that much better.
- As god as my witness,

01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:59.687
you better not lay a hand
on that girl.

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:03.357
This is all on you, Leanne.
It's your fucking fault.

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:05.793
You're gonna find out
what it's like to have

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:08.229
your fucking heart ripped out!

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:09.231
Billy!

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.699
Wait, hey!

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:43.197
Hi, JT, it's Leanne.

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:45.833
Billy just came to see me,
and he's losing his mind.

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:46.867
I don't know if
none of us are safe.

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:48.202
He's coming your way.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:49.770
You gotta just tie him up
or something.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.439
Protect Patty whatever you do.

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:01.982
Where is she?

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:03.050
She's asleep.

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:09.256
Well, that is very...
Very literal, JT, thank you.

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:11.325
He came in on the war path,
all right.

01:17:11.327 --> 01:17:13.861
Talking crazy,
not making much sense.

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:15.763
He mad as heck at you.

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:17.798
Threatened to expose us all
just to hurt you.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.134
He don't even care
if he get himself in trouble

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:21.836
or me, for that matter.

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:23.204
I had to chloroform his ass.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.140
Mom?

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:30.111
Oh, baby!

01:17:30.113 --> 01:17:33.147
I missed you so much.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.883
Oh, it feels so good
to hold you.

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.086
What happened to your face?

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:41.489
What happened to her face?

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.124
I'm so sorry, Leanne.

01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:46.026
Billy got to her last night.
He was acting up.

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:47.495
He got to her before
I could stop him.

01:17:47.497 --> 01:17:48.829
I took him down though.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.268
JT, would you please take
Patty outside for a minute?

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:56.103
I just want to talk to Billy.

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:02.143
Come on, Patty.

01:18:09.819 --> 01:18:11.352
What the fuck?

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.888
You are a son of a bitch.

01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:15.189
I would've never
in a million years

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:16.323
dreamed you could become
such a monster.

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:17.892
You did this to me.

01:18:17.894 --> 01:18:20.060
I was doing fucking fine

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:22.296
until you came along
with all your bullshit and lies!

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:24.198
How dare you hit my baby?

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.967
That little bitch
of yours, you mean?

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:28.269
She's probably going
to be a cock-tease

01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:29.937
just like her momma.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:33.541
Motherfucker!

01:18:33.543 --> 01:18:35.509
God!

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:39.480
You are seriously
going to regret this.

01:18:39.482 --> 01:18:40.481
I promise you that.

01:18:40.483 --> 01:18:42.116
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:44.218
You know JT may be
a little freaked out right now,

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.853
but he's my boy,

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:48.956
and as soon as he calms down,
he'll untie me.

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:51.125
I wouldn't be making
any threats to me

01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:52.226
if I were you, Billy.

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:00.134
You were fucking with me
the whole time, weren't you?

01:19:06.107 --> 01:19:08.175
- Billy, come on.
- No, I did.

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:11.378
You were never going
to leave him, were you?

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.020
Fuck you.

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:24.225
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

01:19:24.227 --> 01:19:26.327
You think I would leave don
for you?

01:19:26.329 --> 01:19:28.495
I may have got with him
for the wrong reasons,

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:29.937
but he is a much better man
than you.

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:33.434
You're nothing
but a mean, old drunk,

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:36.437
a loser, a two-bit criminal
who likes to hit little girls!

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:37.605
You know, you're going down
for this, you bitch!

01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:39.340
No, you are.

01:19:39.342 --> 01:19:41.175
I don't give a shit
if I have to rot in a cell

01:19:41.177 --> 01:19:42.543
for the rest of my life

01:19:42.545 --> 01:19:45.479
as long as you're
doing the same.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:48.048
I mean, you've looked
in the mirror lately, Leanne?

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:51.352
Don't kid yourself, sweetheart.

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:53.254
You're not looking
too hot these days.

01:19:53.256 --> 01:19:54.421
A little old if you ask me.

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:58.259
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:19:58.261 --> 01:19:59.994
I think it'd be about time
to trade you in

01:19:59.996 --> 01:20:01.896
on a newer model anyway.

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:06.166
Now let's both be honest.

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:08.969
We both know I had your dumb ass
wrapped around my little finger,

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:10.905
but I guess some things
never change.

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:15.643
Don't think you're gonna
get over on me,

01:20:15.645 --> 01:20:18.078
you are crazy.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.914
I'll tell your brat
you said goodbye.

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.328
Holy crap.

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:39.293
Jesus, Billy.

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:42.663
Why'd you make me do that?

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:28.142
Baby.

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:31.545
I'm gonna explain
everything, Ok.

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:33.814
Listen, baby, I just...

01:22:33.816 --> 01:22:35.049
Oh, my god!

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:41.355
What the hell happened to Billy?

01:22:41.357 --> 01:22:43.757
He left me no choice, JT.
It was self-defense.

01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:44.825
I swear to god.

01:22:44.827 --> 01:22:46.460
He was... he... he...

01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:56.570
He loved you.
And you just was lying to him.

01:22:56.572 --> 01:22:58.539
You're husband's
not abusive at all, is he?

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:03.577
Mom, why would you do this?

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:18.692
Baby, this is going to
set us up for life.

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:22.296
I hated that you were here
and that you were scared,

01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:25.632
but I knew when the public took
one look at your face,

01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:28.735
they would see
that you're a star,

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:30.337
like you're destined to be.

01:23:33.741 --> 01:23:38.445
Mom, you never hear me.

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:42.116
This is so horrible,
even for you.

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:46.420
Wait, dad doesn't know
you did this, does he?

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:49.323
No, baby,

01:23:49.325 --> 01:23:51.291
daddy's not strong enough
to go through

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:53.293
with a plan like this,

01:23:53.295 --> 01:23:55.896
and I know you don't see it now,
but I did this for our family.

01:23:57.532 --> 01:24:01.368
This... this is going to be
a distant memory,

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:02.703
and the rest of your life

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:05.606
is going to be like
a dream come true, baby.

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:09.476
Stop saying that.
It's just not true.

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:12.279
You did this all for yourself.

01:24:34.802 --> 01:24:36.637
Oh, honey.

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:40.207
You just have no idea

01:24:40.209 --> 01:24:43.310
what it's like to look back
on your life and see regrets.

01:24:44.445 --> 01:24:46.180
Nothing is worse

01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:47.748
than wondering what your life
could've been like

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.583
if you would have
done things differently

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:52.219
or taken bigger risks,
and I don't want that for you.

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:56.823
So I saw an opportunity
this time, and I took it.

01:24:58.259 --> 01:24:59.693
But things just
got out of control.

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:01.728
Sometimes, you just go too far,

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.497
and you just can't
find your way back.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:07.801
But now we are just going to
keep pressing forward.

01:25:14.343 --> 01:25:17.377
Were you cheating on dad
with that creep?

01:25:18.479 --> 01:25:20.714
God, no, honey. Of course not.

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:25.719
And don't you worry
about those two.

01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:27.254
I'm gonna take care of them.

01:25:28.489 --> 01:25:29.890
Mom, you better leave JT alone.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.962
He's my friend,
and he's taking good care of me.

01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:36.630
Honey, I'm glad you liked him,

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:38.765
but that man could cause
a lot of trouble for us, Ok?

01:25:38.767 --> 01:25:39.766
You don't really know him.

01:25:39.768 --> 01:25:42.269
No, you don't know him!

01:25:42.271 --> 01:25:45.839
I'm telling you this, mother,
if anything happens to JT,

01:25:45.841 --> 01:25:47.608
I will tell the whole world
what you've done.

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:49.309
Excuse me?

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:50.644
Now you listen to me,
little lady.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.746
No, you listen.

01:25:52.748 --> 01:25:55.849
I'm not going to let
my friend get hurt

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:57.884
because of your crazy scheming.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.954
I'm so serious.

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:08.121
You wouldn't do that
to your own mother.

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.932
Yeah, what, you're gonna
get rid of me, too, now?

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:16.503
Ok. Ok.

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:44.898
Ok.

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:59.880
JT, can we talk to you
for a minute, please?

01:27:02.583 --> 01:27:03.583
Come on out here.

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.586
Everything Ok out here?

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:07.688
Of course.

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:11.925
I wanted to say thank you

01:27:11.927 --> 01:27:13.927
for taking such good care
of my little girl,

01:27:13.929 --> 01:27:15.862
for keeping her safe,

01:27:15.864 --> 01:27:18.598
and I also wanted to say
that I'm very sorry

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:19.800
for what happened to Billy.

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:24.604
Please know that what I did,
I did for all of our sakes.

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:30.844
And I'm also very sorry

01:27:30.846 --> 01:27:32.446
for what I'm about to do
right now.

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:34.481
Huh?

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:46.460
Thank you all for being here.

01:27:46.462 --> 01:27:50.397
I stand here upon this,
uh, stage, if you will,

01:27:50.399 --> 01:27:52.733
I'm reminded of a quote
by will Shakespeare,

01:27:52.735 --> 01:27:55.869
"cowards die many times
before their deaths.

01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:59.573
The Valiant never taste
of death, but once."

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:08.415
The alleged kidnapper,
this coward of a man,

01:28:08.417 --> 01:28:09.850
is deceased.

01:28:09.852 --> 01:28:13.653
He was identified
as 40-year-old William Fontaine.

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:16.390
The crime seems to be that
of a personal vendetta.

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:21.428
This investigation is ongoing,

01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:22.429
so I can't tell you
any more than the facts

01:28:22.431 --> 01:28:23.497
at this moment.

01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:24.865
I can tell you, however,

01:28:24.867 --> 01:28:28.168
there does appear to be
a hero in this story,

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:33.774
the Valiant,
Mr. Jebediah Thompson.

01:28:36.512 --> 01:28:39.179
Mr. Thompson was acquainted
with Mr. Fontaine,

01:28:39.181 --> 01:28:42.115
who knew that Mr. Thompson
owned a secluded cabin

01:28:42.117 --> 01:28:44.484
in a remote wooded area.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:45.919
This is where
he took Patty Wilson,

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:48.455
and where they remained

01:28:48.457 --> 01:28:51.091
until Mr. Thompson
made an unexpected visit

01:28:51.093 --> 01:28:53.727
to that cabin
and discovered them.

01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:56.563
At this point, he realized
that she was a missing child,

01:28:56.565 --> 01:28:58.064
made an attempt to rescue her,

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:01.601
a fight ensued,
leading to his death.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.639
JT is a rare breed.

01:29:05.641 --> 01:29:08.742
We'd like to thank
him for his courage

01:29:08.744 --> 01:29:10.010
and for rescuing Patty Wilson.

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:26.460
Uh, at this moment, Mrs. Wilson
would like to make a statement.

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:33.533
Hello.

01:29:35.838 --> 01:29:38.238
<i>Well, I just wanna say</i>

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.873
we are over the moon

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:41.508
to have our precious
daughter back,

01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:43.176
and I want to sincerely
thank the FBI,

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.950
sheriff Williams,
and the entire department,

01:29:49.952 --> 01:29:52.486
as well as this community,

01:29:52.488 --> 01:29:54.654
for your compassion
and your generosity

01:29:54.656 --> 01:29:58.892
and your assistance
during this horrific ordeal.

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.695
Don and I are so proud

01:30:01.697 --> 01:30:04.231
of what a strong and
resilient girl Patty is,

01:30:04.233 --> 01:30:06.166
and we're so happy

01:30:06.168 --> 01:30:08.935
that she's going to be able to
show the world her talents.

01:30:10.972 --> 01:30:12.873
<i>But I really want
to take a moment</i>

01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:15.575
to give thanks to JT.

01:30:17.144 --> 01:30:19.880
Because of this brave man,
we have our baby back.

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:23.617
He'll always be our hero,

01:30:23.619 --> 01:30:25.218
and we can never
thank him enough.

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:29.623
One last thing.
One last thing, thank you.

01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:30.657
One last thing.

01:30:30.659 --> 01:30:32.225
<i>I want to thank the lord.</i>

01:30:32.227 --> 01:30:35.228
<i>Thank you, for bringing back
our little girl...</i>

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.665
<i>Safe and sound,</i>

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:41.268
<i>and I want to thank all of you.</i>

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:43.303
<i>God bless you.</i>

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:35.188
Well, if it isn't
Leanne milling.

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:36.890
Oh, I don't have time
for an interview, now, honey.

01:31:36.892 --> 01:31:38.258
I'm meeting someone.

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:42.195
Yeah, I know, you're late.
Have a seat.

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:46.166
Join me.

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:58.612
How dare you send me
that ridiculous text.

01:31:58.614 --> 01:31:59.614
Oh.

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:04.884
Hello, uh, can I get an iced tea
unsweetened, two lemons?

01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:07.754
I'll have the same, but sweet,
very sweet.

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.857
You're Leanne Wilson.

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:12.626
My momma says
you're an inspiration.

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:15.028
That is so kind.

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:17.831
Please tell your momma,
thank you for her love

01:32:17.833 --> 01:32:18.999
and support and prayers.

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:21.401
I'll get those teas.

01:32:23.337 --> 01:32:24.871
Sweet.

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:27.941
You're just loving this,
aren't you?

01:32:27.943 --> 01:32:31.244
The attention, the spotlight,
the fame?

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:33.079
You haven't changed one bit.

01:32:33.081 --> 01:32:36.049
What are you suggesting?
That is disgusting.

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:37.951
Hey, drop the act,
Leanne, please.

01:32:37.953 --> 01:32:39.152
I know the truth.

01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:40.854
Yes, of course, you do.
Everybody does.

01:32:40.856 --> 01:32:41.855
They saw it
on the press conference

01:32:41.857 --> 01:32:43.256
on television today.

01:32:43.258 --> 01:32:45.191
Yeah, I saw it as well,
and I'd have to say

01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:48.028
if I didn't know you were
lying through your teeth,

01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:49.262
I'd have believed every word.

01:32:49.264 --> 01:32:52.265
What? Are you trying
to slander me?

01:32:52.267 --> 01:32:55.101
Slander?

01:32:55.103 --> 01:32:56.870
No, no, no, no.

01:32:56.872 --> 01:32:58.371
The word is expose.

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:01.241
Ok, what is this?

01:33:01.243 --> 01:33:04.110
You still have a little bug
up your ass about high school?

01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:06.146
Oh, no, this is
so much more than that.

01:33:06.148 --> 01:33:09.716
I followed you to that cabin
in the middle of nowhere.

01:33:09.718 --> 01:33:13.053
Imagine my surprise to see
all the key players there.

01:33:13.055 --> 01:33:16.156
You, Billy, JT,

01:33:16.158 --> 01:33:18.925
and your missing child.

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:25.732
Wow. You look worried.

01:33:25.734 --> 01:33:27.200
Are you Ok?

01:33:29.404 --> 01:33:31.304
You have no idea
how good it feels

01:33:31.306 --> 01:33:32.939
after all these years

01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:35.842
to just knock that snotty
look off your face.

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:39.913
Oh, and don't get
any crazy ideas either

01:33:39.915 --> 01:33:41.715
because if anything
happens to me,

01:33:41.717 --> 01:33:44.284
I've made arrangements
for the story to be released.

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:49.255
Oh.

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:53.193
I'm afraid you're going down,

01:33:53.195 --> 01:33:56.229
and I'm so happy
to be the one to do it.

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:00.300
Fuck.

01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:04.070
Wait! Shh!

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:08.908
Please.

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:18.785
You want money for the iced tea?

01:34:18.787 --> 01:34:20.854
No, just sit down, please.

01:34:20.856 --> 01:34:23.189
I want to explain this time.
The truth, for real.

01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:25.525
I know you'll understand.

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:32.465
Ok, Billy and I did reconnect.

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:36.402
Don and I were going through
a really hard time,

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:38.471
and I just talked to Billy,

01:34:38.473 --> 01:34:41.074
and he made me feel
so good about myself,

01:34:41.076 --> 01:34:42.442
but then when I realized

01:34:42.444 --> 01:34:44.511
I couldn't really
go through with it,

01:34:44.513 --> 01:34:46.813
Billy went ballistic.

01:34:46.815 --> 01:34:49.783
He started threatening me,
and then he kidnapped Patty,

01:34:49.785 --> 01:34:51.951
and told me
that if I didn't leave don,

01:34:51.953 --> 01:34:54.454
he would keep her
or maybe do worse,

01:34:55.956 --> 01:34:58.558
and so I figured
I couldn't hurt don

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.560
any more than I already had,

01:35:00.562 --> 01:35:03.530
and I would just
play along with Billy

01:35:03.532 --> 01:35:06.099
until maybe he would
just let Patty go.

01:35:06.101 --> 01:35:08.168
Somehow I figured
I could convince him.

01:35:08.170 --> 01:35:10.470
I thought you were going to
tell me the truth.

01:35:10.472 --> 01:35:12.038
That doesn't add up,

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.360
and you didn't have to
kill Billy.

01:35:14.341 --> 01:35:15.341
I...

01:35:17.077 --> 01:35:18.578
JT did.

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:20.213
He had to.

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:22.015
He was threatening Patty.

01:35:23.117 --> 01:35:25.919
Listen, as far as I'm concerned,

01:35:25.921 --> 01:35:27.887
all signs point
to you being the killer,

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:31.424
and regardless,
you withheld information

01:35:31.426 --> 01:35:33.393
in an abduction
of your own child.

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:36.462
Well, he was blackmailing me.
What was I supposed to do?

01:35:36.464 --> 01:35:39.299
He said if I called the cops,
he would kill himself and Patty.

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:42.202
He was crazy.

01:35:42.204 --> 01:35:44.304
He was not the Billy
we knew from high school.

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:48.608
I don't know, leanne.

01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:51.044
That's just it. You don't know.

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:54.280
And how can you ruin
my entire family

01:35:54.282 --> 01:35:57.217
based on something that you're
really not sure about?

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:01.521
Not to mention,
most people might think that

01:36:01.523 --> 01:36:03.356
you're just trying
to put yourself in the limelight

01:36:03.358 --> 01:36:05.124
by using my tragedy.

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:08.061
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- Yeah, I know it is. It is.

01:36:08.063 --> 01:36:09.229
Yeah.

01:36:09.231 --> 01:36:12.098
I know, but you,
you of all people,

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.500
know the media
and how they can spin things.

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:16.970
And a lot of people
are going to wonder

01:36:16.972 --> 01:36:19.372
why you didn't go
to the police first.

01:36:19.374 --> 01:36:21.641
I was about to break the news.

01:36:21.643 --> 01:36:23.076
I just had to finish
my investigation

01:36:23.078 --> 01:36:24.444
and gather my evidence

01:36:24.446 --> 01:36:27.180
before I presented it
to the authorities.

01:36:27.182 --> 01:36:30.583
I think it's far from
a slam dunk for you.

01:36:30.585 --> 01:36:34.220
I think you might become
the laughing stock of the media.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.227
I have an idea.

01:36:43.932 --> 01:36:47.934
I have an idea that might put
both of us on top.

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:08.187
Oh, you know what,

01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:10.990
will you take a look at this
for me?

01:37:10.992 --> 01:37:13.192
Thank you.
Did I mess up my face?

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:19.666
I think you look great.
Think we look great.

01:37:19.668 --> 01:37:22.468
I think we're ready. Thank you.

01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:25.571
All right, we're on in five,

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:28.074
- and cue music.
- Four, three...

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:33.246
Good evening, I'm Nancy Nelson.

01:37:33.248 --> 01:37:37.250
Tonight, I'm joined
by a mother and survivor,

01:37:37.252 --> 01:37:39.585
Mrs. Leanne Wilson.

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:42.221
She is giving us
the first interview

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:44.490
since she was reunited
with her daughter, Patty,

01:37:44.492 --> 01:37:46.459
who was missing...

01:37:46.461 --> 01:37:50.063
Please welcome,
your host, Ms. Leanne Wilson!

01:37:54.601 --> 01:37:55.601
Oh, wow. Thank you.

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:02.375
Oh, thank you,
thank you so much.

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:06.612
Oh, I just wanted to say...
Oh, thank you so much.

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:08.414
Wow, wow.

01:38:08.416 --> 01:38:11.351
This is really
such an amazing thing

01:38:11.353 --> 01:38:14.120
to happen to our family,

01:38:14.122 --> 01:38:15.488
after so much tragedy,

01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:18.291
to have such a victory
and to be here with you.

01:38:18.293 --> 01:38:20.059
Oh!

01:38:20.061 --> 01:38:22.362
All my life I wanted to do
something to empower women.

01:38:58.565 --> 01:39:02.168
Ok, we're ready for you.
Are you ready, Patty?

01:39:05.672 --> 01:39:07.073
Are you excited?

01:39:08.442 --> 01:39:10.143
You're not nervous are you?

01:39:11.245 --> 01:39:13.346
Ok, we're gonna go up here.

01:39:13.348 --> 01:39:14.747
We're gonna be
a little bit quiet

01:39:14.749 --> 01:39:18.251
'cause they already
started taping, Ok?

01:39:18.253 --> 01:39:19.419
It's just coming up here.

01:39:21.188 --> 01:39:24.424
Oh, and look,
that's your mom on TV.

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:26.793
Let's go.

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:30.596
Come on, y'all.

01:39:30.598 --> 01:39:35.334
Let's give a round of applause
all round. Thank you so much.

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:45.778
I am Leanne Wilson,

01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.815
and this is our
very first Leanne show.

01:39:48.817 --> 01:39:50.283
Thank you so much for being here

01:39:50.285 --> 01:39:52.819
and saying so many
wonderful things,

01:39:52.821 --> 01:39:54.654
giving me the hope and faith

01:39:54.656 --> 01:39:57.356
that I have today
to share with you...

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:01.861
Little Ms. Patty Wilson.

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.665
She's backstage
with her father right now,

01:40:05.667 --> 01:40:07.400
but she'll be out here
any second.

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:11.270
Thank you so much
for being here.

01:40:11.272 --> 01:40:12.839
In a minute,
you are going to meet

01:40:12.841 --> 01:40:15.308
the most beautiful and talented
little girl in the world,

01:40:17.211 --> 01:40:19.145
my daughter, Patty Wilson.

01:40:52.547 --> 01:40:54.881
My mother kidnapped me.
