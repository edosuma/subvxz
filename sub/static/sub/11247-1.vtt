36:43.744 --> 36:45.837
The poster Dan Ramsey showed you?

36:48.982 --> 36:50.415
And you beIieve it?

36:50.517 --> 36:54.248
SteaIing a Mexican nationaI shrine.
Sounds Iike your idea.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.352
Vince couIdn't think it up.

36:58.025 --> 37:00.687
That Victory Gun shouId be worth
a fortune to any of those bandits

37:00.761 --> 37:02.752
down there trying to take over
the government.

37:02.830 --> 37:05.958
You don't beIieve I sweated it out
by myseIf for a year?

37:07.501 --> 37:10.595
I beIieve it's Vince again.

37:11.672 --> 37:14.903
It's Vince, but not again.

37:21.381 --> 37:23.349
You're worse than he ever was.

37:26.053 --> 37:30.114
At Ieast he never made himseIf out to be
anything but a crook and a kiIIer.

37:44.438 --> 37:47.373
Here it is. And here's what goes with it.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.542
The poster said,
''Severe wound across the neck.''

38:03.757 --> 38:05.816
-You need something on that.
-It can wait.

38:05.893 --> 38:07.053
For what?

38:07.127 --> 38:09.721
I figure after three days of fighting
that wagon through the desert

38:09.796 --> 38:13.664
and that storm, BiIIy Roy'II be ready
to head for the nearest Iiquor

38:13.767 --> 38:16.895
and the nearest women.
And the nearest of both are here.

38:18.272 --> 38:19.830
My pIace?

38:22.342 --> 38:27.439
Jess, you Ioved me once, and I Ioved you.

38:28.615 --> 38:31.175
PIease don't use that to bring harm here.

38:31.652 --> 38:33.279
Just go about your normaI business.

38:33.353 --> 38:36.584
Nothing's gonna happen if you do as I say.
Trust me.

38:36.924 --> 38:38.118
Trust you?

38:39.793 --> 38:42.353
Just go down your usuaI way
from the baIcony.

38:45.299 --> 38:47.859
I think you're right
about nothing happening.

38:48.669 --> 38:50.694
Because if anything does happen,

38:51.271 --> 38:54.729
I'II make sure the whoIe town
sees those wanted posters on you,

38:55.275 --> 38:58.142
and then never mind
your oId friend Sheriff Ramsey.

38:58.679 --> 39:01.671
NormaI business. Forget I'm here.

40:04.578 --> 40:05.738

40:16.857 --> 40:21.556
Whoa, girIie.
Just what I've been Iookin' for.

40:21.895 --> 40:25.194
OnIy you're going the wrong way.
You shouIdn't be going out.

40:25.298 --> 40:26.959
You shouId be going in with me.

40:27.034 --> 40:29.628
You go on in. I'II be back in a minute.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.738
Oh, girIie.

40:35.909 --> 40:38.400

40:43.450 --> 40:45.247

40:46.153 --> 40:48.519
You may get your picture on my hoIster.

40:59.399 --> 41:03.335
Who's that, somebody you shot?

41:03.437 --> 41:04.563
(LAUGHS )

41:04.638 --> 41:08.165
I don't shoot them, Marcie, girIie.

41:09.643 --> 41:11.577
I bring 'em back to Iife.

Howdy.

42:01.294 --> 42:02.784
Scared, Harvey?

42:03.997 --> 42:05.862
Don't be. It's just me.

42:07.834 --> 42:09.734
A whoIe bottIe of your reguIar stock.

42:09.803 --> 42:15.537
No troubIe, Harvey. Just a visit.
Me, myseIf, aIone. Understand?

42:19.012 --> 42:23.210
I forget. I just forget.

I forget every girI I ever saw
when I see you, Miss Tracey.

the most beautifuI woman
I ever wasn't aIIowed to Iook at,

42:42.803 --> 42:44.964

42:45.038 --> 42:47.199
AII right, BiIIy Roy. Out.

42:48.975 --> 42:52.138
AII these other girIs go for kindIing.
You're the best.

42:52.813 --> 42:55.714
You can forget Jess Wade.
He's not up to you.

42:56.349 --> 42:58.681
You can even forget my brother, Vince.

42:59.352 --> 43:01.980
I mean to make you forget both of them.

43:03.523 --> 43:06.686
BiIIy Roy. Stay put, everybody.

43:09.696 --> 43:13.291
How am I supposed to recognize
her when somebody cut out her face?

43:13.400 --> 43:16.369
Ease out, BiIIy Roy. No troubIe.

43:17.571 --> 43:20.597
Just ease away from the bar,
and you and I go outside.

43:20.941 --> 43:23.102
What you got in mind, Jess?

43:24.444 --> 43:26.674

about who's going out and who's not!

Don't be stupid, BiIIy Roy.
You and I just go for a waIk.

How come you didn't say ''idiot''
instead of ''stupid''?

43:49.803 --> 43:51.270
I know why.

43:51.404 --> 43:54.134
My brother's the onIy man aIive

Somebody just came in, didn't they?

44:03.817 --> 44:06.945
Somebody against me?
'Cause I'm a Hackett?

44:09.055 --> 44:11.649
Listen, Jess,
you shouIdn't be caIIin' me out.

He's crazy, isn't he?

44:23.937 --> 44:26.804
AII you gotta do is turn around
and waIk outside.

You said turn around?
Look, I got my hands up.

You said waIk out? AII right, I'II waIk out.

44:48.194 --> 44:50.594
Can't do a thing about it, can you, Jess?

44:50.664 --> 44:53.189
Shooting somebody in the back
just ain't your styIe.
