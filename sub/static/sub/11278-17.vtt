00:06.100 --> 00:08.100
No, I don't                     
remember her name.              

00:08.100 --> 00:10.300
        (wind whistling)        

00:10.400 --> 00:11.700
                          Sammy?

00:11.800 --> 00:13.000
                     Yeah. Yeah.
It's Mike Dukakis.              

00:13.100 --> 00:14.900
                            SAM:
                        Yeah.   
        It's Michael Dukakis.   

00:14.900 --> 00:16.500
                    Let's go say
                hello to him.   
    We can't.                   

00:16.500 --> 00:18.500
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!   
            What'll we call him?

00:18.500 --> 00:19.800
            What'll we call him?
Uh, Governor.                   

00:19.900 --> 00:20.800
                Ex. Ex-governor.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.300
Ooh, yeah. Your Honor.          
There you go.                   

00:22.300 --> 00:24.000
                     You... Your
                    Ex Honor.   
No, no, no, no, no.             

00:24.100 --> 00:25.000
                    Yeah.       
             Mike.              

00:25.100 --> 00:26.200
                    Michael.    
    Duke! Duke,                 
    Duke, Duke!                 

00:26.200 --> 00:28.200
            Duke! Duke! Duke!   

00:28.200 --> 00:29.600
Hi. How're you doing?           
                            SAM:
                             Hi.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.100
              Hi.               

00:31.100 --> 00:32.600
        (both laughing)         

00:32.600 --> 00:35.900
                We said hello to
                Michael Dukakis!

00:35.900 --> 00:37.300
  No, no, we said hi to Mike!   

00:37.400 --> 00:38.400
                Michael.        

00:38.400 --> 00:39.400
                         No, no.
                     Duke. Duke.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.600
      Duke. Duke. We said       
         hello to Duke.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.900
          Oh! Uh, uh.           
        Excuse me.              

01:54.900 --> 01:56.100
             Excuse me, Rebecca.

01:56.100 --> 01:57.500
                    Uh, 2:15.   

01:57.500 --> 01:59.500
    Hey, Sammy, here you go.    

01:59.500 --> 02:00.800
                  Thanks, Carla.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.100
     Phew! That was close.      

02:02.200 --> 02:03.300
    What the hell was that?     

02:03.300 --> 02:04.500
    Sammy's vitamin E.          

02:04.500 --> 02:05.900
     It's Valentine's Day.      

02:05.900 --> 02:07.500
                    Duh!        

02:07.500 --> 02:08.699
Oh, yeah.                       

02:08.699 --> 02:11.300
That's that stupid date         
he goes on once a year          

02:11.300 --> 02:13.100
with that-- what is that--      
Lauren person.                  

02:13.200 --> 02:14.500
                        NORM:   
                         Stupid?

02:14.500 --> 02:17.200
                This is not some
        stupid date, Rebecca.   

02:17.200 --> 02:18.500
                    For the last
                    20 years,   

02:18.500 --> 02:20.100
Sammy and Lauren have met       

02:20.100 --> 02:21.800
    for one night each year.    

02:21.800 --> 02:24.200
It's kind of like Sammy's       
     version of commitment.     

02:24.200 --> 02:25.900
                    Actually,   

02:26.000 --> 02:28.400
        it's a lot like         
 <i>my</i> version of commitment.      

02:28.400 --> 02:30.200
                            SAM:
                     Hey, Carla,

02:30.200 --> 02:32.500
how long have you had this      
bottle of vitamin E around, huh?

02:32.600 --> 02:34.200
                I don't know.   
                A while. Why?   

02:37.300 --> 02:39.500
What is with this date          
you go on every year?           

02:39.500 --> 02:42.200
I mean, you know, to me,        
it just... it just seems silly. 

02:42.200 --> 02:43.200
         (men gasping)          
                          Uh-oh!

02:43.200 --> 02:44.400
         Come on, guys.         

02:44.400 --> 02:45.900
         Guys, she just         
      doesn't understand.       

02:46.000 --> 02:48.300
      You see, sweetheart, first
          time Lauren and I met,

02:48.300 --> 02:51.100
                we went up to   
                 this cabin, and
                  we had a night

02:51.200 --> 02:53.700
                that was totally
            romantic and erotic.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.300
                I guess you'd   
                call that silly.

02:57.700 --> 02:58.900
If you liked her so much,       

02:58.900 --> 03:00.400
how come you only               
see her once a year?            

03:00.400 --> 03:02.200
        I don't know. I don't   
          know. It was her idea.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.500
                You know, she   
              never told me why.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.500
        I keep meaning to ask   
         her, but then I forget.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.500
    This year's going           
    to be different, though.    

03:06.600 --> 03:08.100
    I'm gonna pin her down.     

03:08.100 --> 03:09.500
No, I better not do that.       

03:09.500 --> 03:12.100
  Actually, I'll forget again,  
            won't I?            

03:12.200 --> 03:14.200
            Well, I still say   
            it's a stupid way   

03:14.200 --> 03:15.900
                        to spend
                Valentine's Day.
Yeah, but                       

03:15.900 --> 03:17.200
         that's 'cause          
     you don't have a date.     

03:17.200 --> 03:19.100
    Oh, yeah? I happen          
         to have a date         

03:19.200 --> 03:21.200
with two very sweet gentlemen-- 

03:21.200 --> 03:23.200
         Ben and Jerry.         

03:24.600 --> 03:25.900
                  Hey, you know,

03:25.900 --> 03:27.700
             it's just a made-up
                 holiday anyway.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.800
          You know, some big fat
            greeting card tycoon

03:29.800 --> 03:31.200
              trying to get rich

03:31.300 --> 03:33.300
off of dopey cards              
and candy hearts.               

03:33.400 --> 03:34.900
Don't be depressed              
about that.                     

03:34.900 --> 03:36.500
                     Yeah, maybe
                you're right.   

03:36.600 --> 03:38.100
If you're gonna be depressed    
about anything,                 

03:38.200 --> 03:39.300
it should be the fact           

03:39.400 --> 03:41.300
that you're only making         
seven bucks an hour,            

03:41.400 --> 03:44.800
your skin is starting           
to flake at the hairline,       

03:44.900 --> 03:47.400
and you're a year closer        
to death.                       

03:48.500 --> 03:50.300
            Thank you, Carla.   

03:50.300 --> 03:52.700
        But, hey,               
if it makes you feel any better,

03:52.700 --> 03:54.000
     Happy Valentine's Day!     

03:56.600 --> 03:58.800
        Woody, a couple         
      of pitchers, please.      

03:58.800 --> 03:59.900
        Sure, Dr. Crane.        

04:00.000 --> 04:01.100
                Uh, if you're   
                     buying beer

04:01.100 --> 04:02.600
                for your friends
            back there, Fras,   

04:02.700 --> 04:04.300
                  you know, I'm,
            uh... I'm available.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.500
            (laughs)            
            Well...             

04:05.600 --> 04:06.800
        Actually,               
      they're not friends.      

04:06.900 --> 04:08.400
  It's a therapy group I have   

04:08.400 --> 04:10.500
    for men who have trouble    
    relating to women.          

04:10.500 --> 04:12.500
                     (laughing):
                    Well, set   
                'em up, Wood.   

04:14.900 --> 04:16.700
          Ah, Frasier.          

04:16.800 --> 04:17.600
Here you are.                   

04:17.600 --> 04:21.000
            And where are the   
              dysfunctional men?

04:24.700 --> 04:27.000
                Throw a rock.   

04:30.500 --> 04:32.500
They're in the pool room.       

04:32.500 --> 04:34.300
      Come along, ladies.       

04:34.400 --> 04:36.800
Why don't you go on ahead       
    into the poolroom and...    

04:36.800 --> 04:40.600
 make yourselves as comfortable 
 as five women totally hostile  

04:40.600 --> 04:41.800
  to their own bodies can be.   

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
                      After you.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.400
            So, uh,             
  what's going on back there?   

04:47.400 --> 04:50.400
Well, Frasier and I are both    
treating same-sex groups        

04:50.400 --> 04:52.400
with relationship disorders.    

04:52.400 --> 04:55.000
And recent studies suggest      
that there are benefits         

04:55.100 --> 04:57.400
to be gained by bringing        
these two groups together       

04:57.400 --> 04:58.600
for interrelations              

04:58.600 --> 05:00.100
under controlled                
social circumstance.            

05:00.200 --> 05:01.600
        Say what?               

05:01.600 --> 05:03.300
         Well, come on.         

05:03.400 --> 05:05.200
         Surely you've all seen,
            uh, <i>Love Connection.</i>

05:05.200 --> 05:06.400
Oh!                             

05:07.900 --> 05:10.600
G... Guys! Guys!                

05:10.700 --> 05:11.700
  What are you doing out here?  

05:11.700 --> 05:12.700
     Dr. Crane, there's...      
        there's...              

05:12.700 --> 05:13.800
Yes, I know.                    

05:13.900 --> 05:15.600
    There's girls in there.     

05:15.600 --> 05:17.900
But you see,                    
you're missing the point.       

05:17.900 --> 05:19.000
    This is exactly the type    
          of situation          

05:19.000 --> 05:20.500
    we've been training for.    

05:20.500 --> 05:22.700
 This time it's the real thing, 
     not just me in a wig.      

05:33.200 --> 05:35.100
             Whoa!              
Man, those stairs are slippery. 

05:35.100 --> 05:38.100
  Woody, I think we could use   
    a little salt out there.    

05:38.100 --> 05:40.200
            These pretzels could
         use a little salt, too.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.500
             My blood pressure's
            actually dipping.   

05:44.900 --> 05:48.600
  Boy, those patients of mine   
      are really hopeless.      

05:48.600 --> 05:50.100
                     Well, heck,

05:50.100 --> 05:51.000
                      bring them
                    out here.   

05:51.000 --> 05:52.900
                     This is the
                  hopeless room.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.200
Yeah, I don't know, Dr. Crane.  
Haven't you ever thought        

05:57.200 --> 06:00.000
that it's kind of tough on them,
doing all that counseling stuff?

06:00.000 --> 06:03.200
I mean, I was raised to believe 
that if you have a problem,     

06:03.200 --> 06:05.000
        you lock it away        
    in a secret place.          

06:05.100 --> 06:07.100
     You keep it bottled up     
        good and tight.         

06:07.200 --> 06:09.000
 And if it gets full in there,  

06:09.000 --> 06:10.800
     you just keep forcing      
         the pain down          

06:10.800 --> 06:13.400
      and clamping it in.       

06:13.400 --> 06:14.700
      Good advice, Woody.       

06:16.000 --> 06:18.600
Tick, tick, tick.               

06:23.700 --> 06:26.300
Well, guys, I'm all packed      
and ready to go.                

06:26.400 --> 06:27.700
                            Hey.
Hey.                            
                Hey.            

06:27.800 --> 06:29.500
                You sure you got
                everything, Sam?

06:29.600 --> 06:31.800
        Yup.                    

06:33.900 --> 06:35.200
         And then some.         

06:35.200 --> 06:37.100
                    Oh! Oh,     
                    you dog!    

06:37.100 --> 06:38.100
                            Hey!
                        You dog!

06:38.100 --> 06:39.300
        Well, hey,              
        I'm out of here.        

06:39.400 --> 06:40.700
No, no, no.                     

06:40.800 --> 06:41.900
                  No, you don't,
                     Sam Malone!

06:41.900 --> 06:42.900
SAM:                            
What?                           

06:42.900 --> 06:44.100
                  You don't just
                      leave here

06:44.100 --> 06:47.100
 on your 20th-anniversary date  
  with Lauren just like that.   

06:47.100 --> 06:49.600
    We got something special    
cooked up for you. Carla,       

06:49.600 --> 06:50.600
hit it.                         

06:50.600 --> 06:53.600
        (fanfare plays)         

07:07.200 --> 07:09.900
      Ah, look at him go.       

07:10.000 --> 07:11.600
So proud,                       

07:11.600 --> 07:12.800
so majestic,                    

07:12.800 --> 07:14.200
        so regal.               

07:14.200 --> 07:16.000
    (thudding, Sam grunting)    

07:21.900 --> 07:23.100
                          CARLA:
                          Woody,

07:23.100 --> 07:25.500
                you never salted
        those steps, did you?   

07:25.600 --> 07:28.400
Hey, I'll get to it.            

07:36.800 --> 07:39.200
          Let me see.           

07:39.200 --> 07:40.500
                 I don't believe
             there's a fracture,

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
        just a serious sprain   
      right around lumbar three.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.300
                    Does it hurt
                 when I do this?

07:44.400 --> 07:45.400
        (groaning)              

07:45.500 --> 07:46.700
                    That's good.
                    That's good.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.200
    Ooh. Why? Does that mean    
     I'm gonna get better?      

07:49.200 --> 07:50.900
     No. Because it means I know
         what I'm talking about.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.400
        You see, Lilith, I could
     <i>so</i> have been a real doctor.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.900
Hey, give me a hand here,       
        will you, Woody?        

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Oh, geez.                       

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Time's a-wastin',               
my friend.                      

08:00.000 --> 08:01.700
             Oh, Sam, you're not
              seriously thinking

08:01.800 --> 08:03.200
            of still going on   
             this date, are you?

08:03.200 --> 08:05.400
         You bet I am.          
                        NORM:   
                      All right!

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
         (men cheering)         

08:06.600 --> 08:08.200
Sam, I seriously                
urge you                        

08:08.200 --> 08:09.900
to stay off your feet           
and in bed.                     

08:10.000 --> 08:12.300
            Well, that's <i>part</i> of
          the plan, there, Fras.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.900
Hey, Woody, can you do me       
     one tiny little favor?     

08:15.000 --> 08:16.300
                      Sure, Sam.
                     What is it?

08:16.300 --> 08:19.700
  Can you get me up to my car,  
then drive me to Vermont,       

08:19.700 --> 08:21.300
          then get me           
        into the cabin?         

08:21.300 --> 08:23.500
                    What's in   
                      it for me?

08:23.500 --> 08:26.200
Well, you could use             
that new gas card of yours      

08:26.200 --> 08:27.800
to fill the tank.               

08:27.800 --> 08:29.900
        All right!              
     I'll feel so grown up!     

08:35.600 --> 08:36.799
                 All right, Sam.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.700
                 I'm gonna drive
                you up there,   

08:38.700 --> 08:41.299
            and I don't want you
         to worry about a thing.

08:41.299 --> 08:42.600
                      I'm a very
                    good driver.

08:42.700 --> 08:43.900
Great. Great.                   

08:44.000 --> 08:45.900
Just go, please.                

08:47.700 --> 08:49.900
        ¶ Ding, ding, ding.     

08:50.000 --> 08:52.600
What are you doing?             

08:52.700 --> 08:54.600
    "The captain is requesting  

08:54.600 --> 08:57.300
    that all passengers please  
fasten their safety belts."     

08:57.400 --> 08:59.800
              Oh.               

08:59.800 --> 09:01.000
(groans)                        

09:01.100 --> 09:03.400
C-Can you get that              
for me, please?                 

09:03.500 --> 09:05.500
                      Sure, Sam.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.600
                Where is that   
                      seat belt?
        (grunts)                

09:07.700 --> 09:09.700
                     Here it is.

09:09.700 --> 09:10.900
                        Ow!     

09:10.900 --> 09:12.400
                      That hurt!

09:12.500 --> 09:14.600
        I'm sorry.              

09:14.700 --> 09:15.800
      (clicking seat belt)      

09:15.800 --> 09:17.900
                  Nice and snug.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.100
                     Here we go.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.400
      (car engine starts)       

09:23.400 --> 09:25.500
            Ignition, lights,   

09:25.500 --> 09:27.500
                  parking brake,

09:27.500 --> 09:30.400
                 mirror, signal.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.600
     (turn signal clicking)     

09:31.700 --> 09:33.800
                     Blind spot.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.700
                        Vermont,

09:35.700 --> 09:37.200
         here we come.          

09:39.400 --> 09:40.800
        (brakes squeal)         
                Lord have mercy!

09:40.900 --> 09:42.500
What? What happened? Aah!       

09:42.500 --> 09:43.800
            Well, I didn't think

09:43.800 --> 09:45.900
        that pigeon was gonna   
            fly away in time.   

09:46.000 --> 09:48.300
         Why do they always wait
        till the last minute?   

09:48.400 --> 09:50.600
             What, do they think
      that's funny or something?

09:50.600 --> 09:52.600
Aw, I don't know, Woody...      

09:52.600 --> 09:54.500
                  All right. All
            right, Sam, hang on.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.800
  We're gonna pull out again.   

09:55.800 --> 09:59.200
  Mirror, signal, blind spot.   

09:59.300 --> 10:00.700
     (turn signal clicking)     

10:00.700 --> 10:01.900
                          There.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.300
        "Exit 19.               

10:05.400 --> 10:08.700

10:10.800 --> 10:12.700
                      "Exit 20."

10:14.200 --> 10:16.100
                    "Route 125."

10:16.100 --> 10:17.800
    Woody...                    

10:17.800 --> 10:19.100
                Hang on, Sam.   

10:19.200 --> 10:20.400
                     "93 North."

10:20.400 --> 10:23.400
Oh, no, please,                 
don't read all the road signs.  

10:23.400 --> 10:25.700
                  Oh, fine, Sam.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.900
    Would you like me           
to ignore the speed limit, too? 

10:27.900 --> 10:30.100
        I wouldn't mind         
     if you approached it.      

10:30.200 --> 10:32.700
        Meow, Sam.              

10:32.700 --> 10:35.300
        (rattling)              

10:35.400 --> 10:36.600
Sam, I hear some rattling.      

10:36.600 --> 10:38.000
                    Is your door
             closed all the way?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.200
         No, it's not.          

10:39.200 --> 10:40.300
    Here, I'll get it.          

10:40.300 --> 10:41.800
                No, no, hang on.
                     I-I'm gonna

10:41.800 --> 10:44.600
            pull over as soon as
            I make this turn.   

10:44.700 --> 10:46.400
(sighs)                         
                  No, don't undo
                 your seat belt!

10:46.500 --> 10:47.800
Give me a break.                

10:47.800 --> 10:49.100
Will you lighten up?            

10:49.100 --> 10:50.100
Whoa!                           
(thudding)                      

10:50.100 --> 10:51.200
    Now would that have happened

10:51.200 --> 10:53.400
        if you'd been wearing   
            your safety belt?   

10:58.000 --> 11:00.500
                    Now boys,   
                    girls,      

11:00.500 --> 11:03.700
                I have an orange
                  under my chin.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.600
        I am going to attempt to
pass it to this lovely woman,   

11:06.600 --> 11:08.800
             whom I do not fear.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.100
                    Now you see,
                 isn't that fun?

11:17.200 --> 11:19.200
        Whoa!                   

11:19.200 --> 11:21.800
              Now, why don't you
             have a crack at it?

11:21.900 --> 11:23.100
     Edward, how about you?     

11:23.100 --> 11:24.600
            Come on.            

11:24.700 --> 11:26.200
          Here we are.          
         That's lovely.         

11:26.200 --> 11:27.800
          Okay. Ready?          

11:27.900 --> 11:30.000
        Yes. Good, good,        
        good, yes.              

11:32.500 --> 11:35.100
I don't think I want            
to do this, Dr. Crane.          

11:35.100 --> 11:37.000
                  Oh, all right!

11:37.100 --> 11:38.600
              And what would you
             suggest that we do?

11:38.600 --> 11:39.800
     Stare at one another?      

11:39.900 --> 11:42.400
Lord knows you've all had       
    enough practice at that!    

11:42.400 --> 11:43.900
            You're pressuring   
                them, Doctor.   

11:44.000 --> 11:45.700
Oh, you're right, darling. Uh...

11:45.700 --> 11:47.300
You know, perhaps               
we should try                   

11:47.400 --> 11:48.700
a different approach.           

11:48.700 --> 11:50.500
              You know, there is

11:50.600 --> 11:53.400
a technique pioneered           
in the early 60's,              

11:53.500 --> 11:54.800
which is thought                
to be without peer              

11:54.900 --> 11:57.500
in producing the social         
effect that we seek.            

11:57.500 --> 11:59.100
I'm referring,                  
of course, to...                

11:59.100 --> 12:02.100
      Twister!                  

12:02.100 --> 12:04.000
            LILITH:             
        Left foot blue.         

12:10.000 --> 12:10.900
          (door opens)          

12:13.900 --> 12:15.100
                Oh, yeah.       

12:16.600 --> 12:19.100
 Ah, this place is going to see 
      some action tonight.      

12:26.000 --> 12:28.100
        Oh, Sam, you've still   
             got a little gravel

12:28.100 --> 12:29.300
            stuck to the back   
                of your neck.   

12:29.300 --> 12:32.200
Yeah? Well, I like              
it like that.                   

12:32.300 --> 12:33.500
Just get me                     
on the bed there.               

12:33.600 --> 12:36.000
You can take off and come       
pick me up in the morning.      

12:36.100 --> 12:37.300
    (car approaching)           

12:37.400 --> 12:39.300
    Oh, hey, that's             
    Lauren's car there.         

12:39.300 --> 12:41.100
Oh, great! I'm really looking   
         forward to meeting her.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.200
No, no, man. You g...           
you got to get out of here.     

12:43.200 --> 12:45.000
If she sees you, she's gonna    
think something's wrong.        

12:45.000 --> 12:46.800
It'll ruin the mood.            
Just quick-- get out the window.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.700
    Go on!                      
                Oh, sure.       

12:48.700 --> 12:50.700
        "Quick, out the window."

12:50.700 --> 12:53.000
    Not exactly the undying     
      thanks and gratitude      

12:53.000 --> 12:56.400
  I might expect after driving  
  200 miles through the snow.   

12:56.500 --> 12:58.100
     Would you just shut up     
      and move your butt?       

12:58.100 --> 12:59.200
  Oh, that's much better, Sam.  

12:59.200 --> 13:00.800
      That'll keep me warm      
    on the drive home.          

13:09.600 --> 13:10.700
Sam, there's a door here.       

13:10.700 --> 13:12.700
Why'd I go                      
out the window?                 

13:12.800 --> 13:14.200
  Would you get out of here?!   

13:14.300 --> 13:16.200
             Go on!             

13:26.900 --> 13:29.200
  Happy Valentine's Day, Sam.   

13:29.200 --> 13:31.300
 Happy Valentine's Day, Lauren. 

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
          Aww... wait.          

13:32.400 --> 13:34.100
  Why? Wh-what are you doing?   

13:34.100 --> 13:36.300
 I want to get a running start. 
No-no!                          

13:36.400 --> 13:37.600
        No! No! Lauren!         

13:37.600 --> 13:39.400
            Nooooo!             

13:45.300 --> 13:48.000
      Now you have to play      
         by the rules.          

13:48.000 --> 13:50.700
     The bottle is clearly      
    pointing at Jill.           

13:52.100 --> 13:53.900
                 Now, Jules, you
            have to kiss her.   

13:54.000 --> 13:55.300
            I pass.             

13:55.300 --> 13:57.500
         For the hundredth time,
                you cannot pass!

13:57.600 --> 13:58.700
         Okay, I quit.          

14:02.900 --> 14:05.900
            Perhaps it's time   
        we admit our failure.   

14:05.900 --> 14:08.000
    It was a well-intentioned   
                     experiment,

14:08.100 --> 14:09.800
              but we realize now
        that you're not ready   

14:09.900 --> 14:11.700
                for this type of
             social interaction.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.500
             I guess we can only
             conclude by saying,

14:14.600 --> 14:16.400
                  "Oh, well."   

14:17.600 --> 14:18.600
            FRASIER:            
              No!               

14:18.700 --> 14:20.100
    I'm not giving up!          

14:20.100 --> 14:22.000
            How difficult can it
             be to kiss a woman?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.600
        Be a little assertive   
          for once in your life!

14:25.000 --> 14:26.800
                 Now you see how
        easy that was? Again.   

14:27.900 --> 14:28.900
                    Again!      

14:39.500 --> 14:40.900
                Class dismissed.
                  Let's go, hon.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.000
         (Lauren moans)         

14:57.100 --> 14:58.700
        Sam, is something wrong?

14:58.700 --> 15:00.100
Mm-mm, why?                     

15:00.100 --> 15:01.900
         You're biting your lip.
Mm.                             

15:01.900 --> 15:03.600
    Usually, you bite my lip.   
    (chuckles)                  

15:04.600 --> 15:06.400
        I'm sorry.              

15:06.400 --> 15:08.000
I have an idea.                 
              Ow!               

15:11.900 --> 15:13.800
      (sultry music plays)      

15:13.900 --> 15:16.400
      Let's dance the way       
        we used to, Sam.        

15:19.600 --> 15:21.200
        (chuckles)              

15:21.200 --> 15:23.600
      You know something,       
        we always dance.        

15:23.700 --> 15:25.200
W-Why don't we just, uh...      

15:25.200 --> 15:28.700
     why don't we just sit      
        very still, huh?        

15:30.500 --> 15:33.200
Yeah, i-it could become         
a new tradition for us.         

15:33.200 --> 15:35.900
                Come on, Sam,   
            let's slow dance.   

15:36.000 --> 15:37.700
        (grunts):               
              No!               

15:37.800 --> 15:39.900
             You like that, huh?

15:39.900 --> 15:41.600
Hey, I've got a great idea here.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.600
Let's, uh, tell you what.       

15:43.600 --> 15:47.000
You want to learn that new dance
that's sweeping Boston?         

15:47.000 --> 15:48.100
                    I'm game.   
                  What do we do?

15:48.200 --> 15:52.100
The guy kind of stands          
like this, very still.          

15:52.100 --> 15:53.400
     And sometimes              

15:53.500 --> 15:55.600
he leans up against something.  

15:55.600 --> 15:58.500
And pretty soon his legs        
start to tremble.               

15:58.600 --> 16:00.100
                 Sort of the way
                  yours are now.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.300
      Yeah, yeah.               

16:01.300 --> 16:02.800
There, you like it?             
(snapping fingers)              

16:05.900 --> 16:07.200
                 Well, what does
                    the girl do?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.400
 Usually she runs for some ice. 

16:11.100 --> 16:13.300
    You don't want to dance,    
          do you, Sam?          

16:13.300 --> 16:15.600
  No, you know, the truth is,   
        I really don't.         

16:15.600 --> 16:16.900
     Sam, what's going on?      

16:16.900 --> 16:18.700
    What do you mean?           

16:18.700 --> 16:19.600
                     Never mind.

16:19.700 --> 16:20.700
        I think I know.         

16:20.700 --> 16:21.700
         (music stops)          

16:21.700 --> 16:23.600
     I mean, it's obvious.      

16:23.600 --> 16:26.000
    I'm not exactly as young    
as I used to be and, um...      

16:26.100 --> 16:27.200
 Oh, sweetheart, wait a minute. 

16:27.300 --> 16:28.800
 Wait, is that what you think?  

16:28.900 --> 16:30.300
        Well, it's okay.        
     You can level with me.     

16:30.300 --> 16:31.600
  I've gotten too old for you.  

16:31.700 --> 16:34.800
Oh, no. Listen, age has nothing 
         to do with it.         

16:34.800 --> 16:38.000
      You-- you are still       
    as young and sexy           

16:38.100 --> 16:40.200
as that first day               

16:40.300 --> 16:43.000
and night and next morning      
          that we met.          

16:43.000 --> 16:44.300
          Really, Sam?          

16:44.400 --> 16:47.200
    Then why are you acting     
        so standoffish?         

16:47.200 --> 16:50.200
Yeah... oh, honey, I've got     
to level with you here.         

16:50.300 --> 16:51.700
      Sweetie, I fell down      
        the steps today.        

16:51.700 --> 16:53.500
      I threw my back out.      
    I can barely move.          

16:53.600 --> 16:54.900
                Oh...           

16:55.000 --> 16:57.500
        Well, I'm not surprised,
                 a man your age.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.300
        Hey, look!              

17:11.500 --> 17:14.200
         That cute guy,         
    with the hairy knuckles,    

17:14.300 --> 17:17.599
he just left me a five buck tip 
     inside this Valentine.     

17:17.700 --> 17:18.700
                 How 'bout that?

17:25.500 --> 17:26.900
            So what?            

17:27.000 --> 17:28.200
      I thought that we...      

17:28.200 --> 17:30.500
         didn't care...         

17:30.500 --> 17:32.500
         about that...          

17:32.600 --> 17:34.400
    stupid made-up...           

17:34.400 --> 17:37.200
  Valentine corporate garbage.  

17:43.900 --> 17:45.600
                     That's just
                 what losers say

17:45.700 --> 17:46.800
        when they don't get any.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.100
                  But I got one,
                and at 11:40.   

17:50.200 --> 17:51.600
        Right under the wire.   

17:51.600 --> 17:54.800
        Whoa, I almost pulled   
            a Rebecca that time.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.500
  That's not very nice, Carla.  

17:59.900 --> 18:01.100
                You're right.   

18:01.100 --> 18:02.500
                      I'm sorry.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.700
                I almost forgot.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.000
            Guess who called you
             to wish you a Happy

18:07.000 --> 18:07.900
                Valentine's Day?
              Who?              

18:08.000 --> 18:09.900
                    Nobody!     

18:14.700 --> 18:17.900
                 Well, don't you
        worry there, Rebecca.   

18:17.900 --> 18:19.500
                Nobody's a loser
                    on this day.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.700
        I'm not going to, uh,   

18:20.700 --> 18:23.200
        let you leave the bar   
                empty-handed.   

18:23.200 --> 18:24.700
What's this?                    

18:24.700 --> 18:27.300
              It's a Valentine's
              card I got for Ma,

18:27.300 --> 18:30.700
            but I, I think it   
            suits you better.   

18:30.700 --> 18:32.400
      Gee, Cliff, thanks.       

18:32.500 --> 18:34.800
Hey! Carla!                     

18:34.800 --> 18:36.900
         I did get one!         

18:36.900 --> 18:38.300
        So, uh...               

18:38.300 --> 18:39.700
  what am I gonna get for it?   

18:42.400 --> 18:43.800
            What do you mean?   

18:43.800 --> 18:47.200
Eh, come on, baby,              
swing a little.                 

18:51.400 --> 18:53.500
                     What?      

18:53.500 --> 18:55.700
Well, according to Fras, uh,    

18:55.700 --> 18:58.100
babes like guys                 
who are assertive.              

18:58.100 --> 18:59.800
    Aw, come on,                

18:59.900 --> 19:00.900
Robin's not here,               

19:00.900 --> 19:03.200
Sam's out of the picture.       

19:03.200 --> 19:05.700
You've had the rest,            
now try the best.               

19:17.700 --> 19:19.600
Happy Valentine's Day, Cliff.   

19:25.500 --> 19:27.400
        Thank you.              

19:36.200 --> 19:38.700
            Cliffie, uh, where--
                  where is ev...

19:38.700 --> 19:40.900
                    Cliffie?    

19:41.000 --> 19:42.700
                 (snaps fingers)

19:42.700 --> 19:44.700
                    Cliffie!    

19:59.600 --> 20:01.100
        Thank you.              

20:04.600 --> 20:07.100
        I've had 20-20 vision   
                    all my life.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.600
                Now when I go   
                to a restaurant,

20:08.600 --> 20:10.100
          I have to have someone
            at the next table   

20:10.100 --> 20:11.500
                hold the menu so
                  I can read it.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.000
         (both chuckle)         

20:13.000 --> 20:15.200
No, you know what the worst     
thing about old age is?         

20:15.200 --> 20:18.100
It's when you get so old that   
the skin under your arms        

20:18.200 --> 20:22.500
starts getting loose            
and hanging like turkey wattle. 

20:22.600 --> 20:24.500
         I thought that         
    only happened to women.     

20:24.500 --> 20:26.600
Yeah, that's what I meant.      

20:27.900 --> 20:31.600
    I just, you know, I hate    
     to see it, that's all.     

20:31.600 --> 20:34.400
             Has your doctor put
             you on a bran diet?

20:34.400 --> 20:36.400
Oh, yeah, God...                

20:36.500 --> 20:39.500
        Oh, I tell you--        
    oh, thank you. Oh!          

20:39.600 --> 20:41.700
    Last year was the worst.    

20:41.700 --> 20:43.600
  You know, I went in for this  
        stomach problem.        

20:43.700 --> 20:46.200
    Turned out I had a stone    
    the size of a golf ball.    

20:46.300 --> 20:47.800
  Took me a month to pass it.   

20:47.900 --> 20:50.100
Sam, has your hair              
started turning gray?           

20:50.200 --> 20:51.600
    Hey, hey. You're getting    
    a little personal there.    

20:51.600 --> 20:53.600
          Aren't you?           

20:53.600 --> 20:55.400
                 Sam, look, it's
              getting light out.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.200
                      We've been
              talking all night.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.600
    Oh, hey, how about that?    

20:59.600 --> 21:02.400
    Wow! You know, that's...    
        that's a first.         

21:02.500 --> 21:03.800
      Kind of nice to know      
          that we have          

21:03.800 --> 21:05.800
      something in common       
      besides our bodies.       

21:05.800 --> 21:07.800
            Oh, yeah, we have   
            the deterioration   

21:07.800 --> 21:09.000
                  of our bodies.
            Yeah.               

21:10.300 --> 21:11.900
                  Well, I've got
             a long drive ahead.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.200
     I better get started.      

21:13.200 --> 21:14.500
      Oh, no. Wait, wait.       

21:14.500 --> 21:15.900
  Wait a second here, listen.   

21:15.900 --> 21:18.100
Honey, y-you can't go now.      

21:18.100 --> 21:20.000
I mean, we barely spent         
the night together.             

21:20.100 --> 21:21.500
W-Why can't you stay?           

21:21.500 --> 21:23.900
    Oh, Sam, I would love to,   
    but you know how this works.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.300
          Just one night a year.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.900
        Yeah, but that's        
 a stupid rule, you know that?  

21:28.000 --> 21:29.200
 I never have understood that.  

21:29.200 --> 21:30.500
     W-Why can't you stay?      

21:30.500 --> 21:32.900
    I have to get to Portland   
             by Presidents' Day.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.400
            There's a linebacker
            I always meet there.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.100
    You, you do this            
    with other guys?            

21:40.100 --> 21:41.600
            Well, you have other
            women, don't you?   

21:41.600 --> 21:43.700
Well, yeah, but not once a year.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.900
    I mean, I thought I was     
        special to you.         

21:47.900 --> 21:49.300
            Oh, Sam, you are.   

21:49.300 --> 21:51.400
                You'll always be
                my Valentine.   

21:56.300 --> 21:57.600
                     Next year. 

21:57.600 --> 21:59.400
        Yeah, all right.        

21:59.400 --> 22:00.800
            Bye-bye.            

22:02.300 --> 22:05.800
Listen, I could start seeing you
    on Arbor Day, too.          

22:05.800 --> 22:06.700
            Really?             
                         Mm-hmm.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.000
        Oh, great!              

22:08.100 --> 22:10.400
Don't you see another guy       
     on Arbor Day, though?      

22:10.400 --> 22:11.500
             I did, but he died.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.400
              How?              

22:14.400 --> 22:15.700
                     Happy.     

22:15.900 --> 22:18.200
          Okay, okay.           

22:18.300 --> 22:20.900
          Yeah, yeah.           
     We'll do it next time.     

22:37.400 --> 22:39.300
          Thank you...
