WEBVTT

00:00.602 --> 00:02.081
Uncle Earl.

00:04.162 --> 00:06.437
Or Aunt Pearl.

00:09.282 --> 00:10.431
What do you think, son?

00:10.522 --> 00:12.990
Wow. Put on an apron
and a pair of combat boots

00:13.082 --> 00:15.198
and you could be her twin.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.994
You're right. l think l'll go with Earl.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.353
Daddy, l think you need
to take the canyon.

00:24.442 --> 00:27.434
The highway is jammed.

00:27.522 --> 00:29.911
And how do l know that?

00:30.002 --> 00:34.518
Because l have streaming live traffic
on my new O-Phone.

00:34.602 --> 00:39.232
''Tomorrow's technology,
today, today, today.''

00:39.322 --> 00:40.960
l know, l know.

00:42.642 --> 00:45.759
Man, l wish l had the O-Phone
instead of this stupid Slim Flip.

00:45.842 --> 00:50.597
''Look at me. l'm slim and l flip,
l'm slim and l flip, l'm slim and l flip.''

00:51.682 --> 00:53.001
Man.

00:53.682 --> 00:56.196
-<i>Do you want the O-Phone?</i>
-Yes, l do!

00:56.282 --> 00:59.160
<i>No, you don't. Not when you can have</i>
<i>the new z-Phone.</i>

00:59.242 --> 01:02.359
<i>With high-def display</i>
<i>and digi-dynamic sound,</i>

01:02.442 --> 01:05.354
<i>it makes the O-Phone old news.</i>

01:09.282 --> 01:13.878
-Daddy, you saw that commercial.
-Yes, l did. v ery nice graphics.

01:14.522 --> 01:17.594
Dad, the Z-Phone's not just a phone.

01:17.682 --> 01:21.561
lt's full of dynamic digi stuff.

01:21.642 --> 01:22.916
l have to have it!

01:23.002 --> 01:26.074
Now, that's what you said
when you begged me for the O-Phone.

01:26.162 --> 01:28.995
-l was a child then.
-lt was last month.

01:30.202 --> 01:32.670
But l've grown!
l have new phone needs!

01:32.762 --> 01:34.195
Tell him, Lola.

01:34.282 --> 01:37.399
Why? So l can hear you brag
about your new-new phone?

01:37.482 --> 01:40.554
<i>Give it up for Hannah Montana!</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:44.920
-Help me out and you get this one.
-Oh, boy!

01:45.002 --> 01:47.880
Shame on you
for buying her this dinosaur.

01:47.962 --> 01:50.476
l am disappointed in you, mister!

01:51.242 --> 01:53.073
Somehow l'll go on.

01:53.722 --> 01:57.317
<i>l would like to dedicate this concert</i>
<i>to my daddy.</i>

01:57.402 --> 02:01.441
<i>A dad as cool as the new z-Phone!</i>
<i>How awesome are they?</i>

02:02.602 --> 02:04.399
<i>Hold that thought.</i>

02:05.402 --> 02:07.791
Did l mention it comes with GPS?

02:08.642 --> 02:11.202
Did l mention l ain't getting it?

02:19.762 --> 02:21.320
<i>come on!</i>

02:21.402 --> 02:25.315
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:25.402 --> 02:28.997
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe</i>
<i>every colour</i>

02:29.082 --> 02:32.870
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

02:32.962 --> 02:37.717
<i>lt's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

02:37.802 --> 02:41.078
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

02:41.162 --> 02:46.395
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:46.482 --> 02:50.475
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:50.562 --> 02:52.473
<i>chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:52.562 --> 02:54.154
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:54.242 --> 02:58.679
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:58.762 --> 03:00.195
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:00.282 --> 03:03.752
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:06.642 --> 03:08.598
<i>Thank you, Long Beach!</i>

03:12.362 --> 03:16.514
Darling, it's a phone, not a kidney.
You can live without it.

03:16.602 --> 03:18.433
But... But, Daddy...

03:18.522 --> 03:20.319
Hannah!

03:20.402 --> 03:26.272
Loved your shout-out to the Z-Phone.
l just can't live without it.

03:27.122 --> 03:28.680
You don't say.

03:29.522 --> 03:31.513
Honey, did l ever tell you
that when l was a kid,

03:31.602 --> 03:35.311
l had a one-eyed carrier pigeon
who just flew around in circles?

03:35.402 --> 03:37.870
Kept bringing me my own note back.

03:38.962 --> 03:40.600
l survived it.

03:40.682 --> 03:45.517
Hannah, your daddy's so funny
when he goes all Pony Express.

03:45.602 --> 03:47.354
Well, l'm glad l can amuse you.

03:47.442 --> 03:50.878
Now l just got to get out back there
and saddle up the old limo.

03:50.962 --> 03:52.281
Stop it!

03:53.402 --> 03:57.918
So, what's your Z-Code
so we can Z-Chat and Z-Text?

03:58.002 --> 04:01.711
-Mine's still in zee box.
-Yeah, in zee store.

04:03.922 --> 04:06.072
l'm having it Hannah-fied.

04:06.722 --> 04:10.601
Like yours, but more. lf that's possible.

04:11.482 --> 04:15.031
-l can't wait to see it.
-That makes two of us.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.677
l'm getting a Z-Minder.

04:23.922 --> 04:28.200
<i>Traci, time to leave</i>
<i>for Amanda Bynes's beach barbecue</i>

04:28.282 --> 04:30.432
<i>to benefit baby belugas.</i>

04:33.962 --> 04:37.113
l'm just so grateful to live in a world

04:37.202 --> 04:40.956
where people like us
can have phones like this.

04:41.042 --> 04:42.316
l know.

04:45.522 --> 04:47.353
Why did you say you have that phone?

04:47.442 --> 04:50.036
Simple. l have the lQ of a peanut.

04:51.322 --> 04:53.552
As soon as she finds out
that l don't have that phone,

04:53.642 --> 04:55.678
she's gonna tell everybody.

04:55.762 --> 05:00.278
''BeyoncÃ©, did you hear?
Hannah doesn't have the Z-Phone!''

05:00.362 --> 05:01.795
l'll be a joke!

05:01.882 --> 05:06.353
l want that phone, l want that phone,
l want that phone!

05:08.682 --> 05:11.401
Hannah has a hissy! Thanks, kid.

05:11.482 --> 05:13.279
Can't you people
ever give me a break?

05:13.362 --> 05:17.150
Sorry, kid! This picture's gonna pay
for my new Z-Phone!

05:19.642 --> 05:20.995
l cannot believe this.

05:21.282 --> 05:24.592
l made myself look like a total idiot,
all because of that phone.

05:24.682 --> 05:28.595
l'm on the front page!
Don't l look so cute when l'm scared?

05:30.042 --> 05:32.715
lf you don't get over yourself
in about three seconds,

05:32.802 --> 05:35.680
you're gonna look absolutely adorable!

05:37.002 --> 05:39.391
-Three seconds? That's it?
-Take it or leave it.

05:39.482 --> 05:41.438
-Fine.
-Go!

05:41.522 --> 05:43.433
Look at my hair! Look at my eyes!
Look at my outfit!

05:43.522 --> 05:45.638
-l'm a star, l'm a star, l'm a star!
-Time!

05:45.722 --> 05:47.440
Okay, l'm good.

05:48.522 --> 05:51.673
lt's Traci calling on her new Z-Phone.

05:51.762 --> 05:53.115
You know what?
l'm just gonna tell her the truth.

05:53.202 --> 05:56.512
lt can't be any more humiliating
than this picture.

05:58.002 --> 06:01.039
Listen, Traci, about the Z-Phone...

06:01.122 --> 06:05.161
l call firsties.
Did you hear the dish on Dakota?

06:05.242 --> 06:08.598
She doesn't have the Z-Phone
because her daddy won't let her.

06:08.682 --> 06:10.798
lsn't that positively medieval?

06:11.322 --> 06:14.314
Yeah. lmagine having a father like that.

06:15.882 --> 06:17.998
l know!

06:18.082 --> 06:21.631
Svetlana, you're massaging my neck,
not wringing out a mop!

06:22.122 --> 06:26.240
Anyway, promise you won't tell anyone.

06:26.722 --> 06:28.474
Because you don't want me
to embarrass her?

06:28.722 --> 06:32.681
Of course not. That's my job.

06:36.802 --> 06:40.158
Well, it must feel good
to get that off your chest.

06:41.242 --> 06:44.951
You know, life is a lot easier
with a sense of humour.

06:45.042 --> 06:48.398
Life is also a whole lot easier
with that phone!

06:48.482 --> 06:51.599
You know, it's funny. Just last week
you actually did have the money,

06:51.682 --> 06:56.517
but you spent it all on those shoes
and that purse and that Miley necklace.

06:56.602 --> 06:59.639
Remember what l said
about a sense of humour.

06:59.722 --> 07:01.519
This is so unfair.

07:02.442 --> 07:07.277
Some sleazy, disgusting paparazzi
gets a humiliating picture of Hannah,

07:07.362 --> 07:09.159
and suddenly he has the phone l want.

07:09.242 --> 07:11.358
Yeah, l know.
lf only we were sleazy and disgusting,

07:11.442 --> 07:14.434
we could take a picture of you
and sell it.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.196
What?

07:17.962 --> 07:20.920
How you doing, Sleazy?
l'm Disgusting.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.474
Hey, Dad, wish me luck.

07:29.562 --> 07:31.678
l'm off to a shirts-and-skins
volleyball game.

07:31.762 --> 07:34.481
And, lucky for the ladies, l'm skins.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.113
You got your wallet?

07:39.882 --> 07:41.076
Yeah.

07:43.722 --> 07:45.235
Now.

07:45.322 --> 07:47.517
How about your sunglasses?

07:47.602 --> 07:48.671
Yes.

07:50.882 --> 07:51.997
Now.

07:53.162 --> 07:57.838
-And did you remember to put on...
-Underwear! Of course! l'm not an idiot!

07:59.802 --> 08:03.511
l was gonna say sunscreen, but l'm
glad to hear about the underwear.

08:03.602 --> 08:06.594
Come on, Dad. Do you really think you
need to remind me about sunscreen?

08:06.682 --> 08:09.116
l live in LA,
l go to the beach every day...

08:09.202 --> 08:10.237
So you forgot.

08:10.322 --> 08:14.031
l'll put it on when l get there!
Stop treating me like a child. Gosh!

08:22.082 --> 08:23.993
Jackson, is that you?

08:26.922 --> 08:28.753
How'd the volleyball go?

08:28.842 --> 08:31.959
What can l say, Dad?
l was on fire out there.

08:33.361 --> 08:34.841
That's my boy.

08:34.922 --> 08:38.357
Now go shower up. We got us
some Tennessee football to watch!

08:38.442 --> 08:40.398
l think l'm just gonna go take a nap.

08:40.482 --> 08:43.871
Nap? Stewart men don't nap
when there's football on!

08:43.962 --> 08:45.839
That's what golf is for!

08:46.882 --> 08:48.998
Okay, l'll be right down.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:59.962 --> 09:01.918
-Hello?
-Hello?

09:02.322 --> 09:06.520
Perfect. No one's in here.
Okay, we can do this.

09:07.002 --> 09:12.713
l'll call it <i>Hannah, Before the Glamour.</i>

09:27.482 --> 09:31.475
-Take the picture already!
-l don't know. lt looks too posed.

09:31.562 --> 09:33.757
That's 'cause it is posed!

09:33.842 --> 09:34.957
See, that's the problem.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.112
We need to make it
look more spontaneous,

09:37.202 --> 09:40.911
like you were taken by surprise.
We need to make it...

09:45.962 --> 09:47.759
Hey, Mile, do you know
what this thing does?

09:47.842 --> 09:50.356
l think l got a pretty good idea!

09:51.682 --> 09:54.196
-Hey, that could work.
-You think?

10:00.922 --> 10:03.516
<i>And Tennessee football is on the air!</i>

10:03.602 --> 10:07.356
Son, get your butt down here!
lt's kickoff time!

10:17.322 --> 10:19.358
l personally love the look,

10:19.442 --> 10:23.560
but l think you need to put
a little more boo-yah in your hoo-yah!

10:24.802 --> 10:26.281
Boo-yah!

10:36.002 --> 10:39.392
l love it! lt's embarrassing,
humiliating, demeaning!

10:39.482 --> 10:42.952
-l know. She looks like a complete idiot!
-He gets it.

10:43.842 --> 10:45.400
Congratulations, you just knocked

10:45.482 --> 10:47.552
''Double-Jointed vampire
Bites His Own Butt''

10:47.642 --> 10:50.110
right off the front page.

10:50.202 --> 10:54.832
Look at you.
The future of sleaze journalism.

10:54.922 --> 10:58.119
l'll be right back
with your blood money.

10:58.202 --> 11:00.193
Man, l hope this Z-Phone is worth it.

11:00.282 --> 11:03.752
lt is! And trust me, there's been
a lot worse pictures of Hannah.

11:03.842 --> 11:05.355
l don't know. This one's pretty goofy.

11:05.442 --> 11:08.195
l mean, your hair in curlers
and your eyes bugging out,

11:08.282 --> 11:11.194
and your Miley necklace
flopping all over the place.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.635
Future of sleaze journalism say what?

11:21.082 --> 11:22.515
Oh, my gosh.

11:22.602 --> 11:25.275
As soon as they blow up this picture,
they blow up my secret!

11:25.362 --> 11:26.761
How could you have missed this?

11:26.842 --> 11:29.640
Me? You're the one
who bought that stupid necklace.

11:29.722 --> 11:32.634
lf you had gotten your name
on a refrigerator magnet like l did,

11:32.722 --> 11:35.236
we wouldn't have this problem.

11:35.322 --> 11:36.550
Here's your money, kids.

11:36.642 --> 11:37.677
Thanks to you, in two days,

11:37.762 --> 11:40.595
that picture's gonna be
on every newsstand in the country.

11:40.682 --> 11:42.673
Yeah, about that.

11:42.762 --> 11:45.037
See, we're starting to feel

11:46.242 --> 11:48.278
a little uncomfortable
with the situation...

11:48.442 --> 11:50.000
First-timer's guilt.

11:50.082 --> 11:52.118
You'll get over that
once you start spending that money.

11:52.202 --> 11:55.558
Hey, have you seen
those new Z-Phones? lncredible.

11:56.202 --> 11:59.956
Yeah, l'm more of a letter writer.

12:01.722 --> 12:05.840
Anyway, l really need that picture back.

12:05.922 --> 12:07.640
You know what l need back?

12:07.722 --> 12:12.398
The hair l had in 1 980!
lt's on my back now.

12:14.482 --> 12:18.236
Life is cruel, get over it. Now get out!

12:18.802 --> 12:20.201
Talk!

12:20.282 --> 12:21.954
-What are we gonna do?
-l don't know!

12:22.042 --> 12:23.395
l don't want excuses!

12:23.482 --> 12:25.950
The Rock's in town for his new movie.
He's staying at The Plaza,

12:26.042 --> 12:30.194
and l need a picture that makes him
want to crawl under a rock.

12:30.282 --> 12:33.319
And then a regular photo.
My son's a fan.

12:33.402 --> 12:35.313
We can get you a picture of The Rock.

12:35.402 --> 12:37.438
-l'm listening.
-So am l.

12:39.362 --> 12:41.956
l will trade you
one humiliating picture of Hannah

12:42.042 --> 12:45.751
for an even more humiliating picture
of The Rock.

12:45.842 --> 12:49.437
Kid, if you can get me a picture of one
of the world's most popular movie stars

12:49.522 --> 12:52.400
looking more ridiculous than
your picture of Hannah Montana,

12:52.482 --> 12:53.517
you got a deal.

12:53.602 --> 12:55.957
-Easy peasy lemon sleazy.
-Oh, boy.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.361
Come on.

12:58.122 --> 13:02.081
<i>He breaks a tackle!</i>
<i>He could go all the way!</i>

13:02.162 --> 13:03.800
Touchdown!

13:03.882 --> 13:07.557
Time for another
Tennessee Touchdown Stomp.

13:08.322 --> 13:09.516
Again?

13:20.162 --> 13:21.595
Yeah!

13:22.802 --> 13:25.600
Son, what is the matter with you?

13:25.682 --> 13:29.357
l'm just a little stiff
from the volleyball game.

13:29.442 --> 13:34.880
Well, sit up here and let me give you
a good, hard, Robby Ray rubdown!

13:36.162 --> 13:39.359
No! No, no, no, Dad, really.
l'm all right!

13:39.442 --> 13:41.273
Don't be silly. What you need

13:41.362 --> 13:45.241
is a good old-fashioned
deep-tissue massage

13:45.322 --> 13:49.759
from hands strengthened
by years of steel guitar playing.

13:49.842 --> 13:53.073
-All right, here l come.
-Here he comes.

13:53.162 --> 13:54.436
-Get ready.
-Okay.

13:54.522 --> 13:57.559
-Almost there.
-Almost there.

13:57.642 --> 14:02.272
Okay! Okay! All right! l admit it!
l'm burnt! l forgot the sunscreen!

14:02.362 --> 14:03.431
No!

14:04.442 --> 14:06.876
Wait a minute.
When did you figure it out?

14:10.682 --> 14:15.437
l heard you halfway up the beach, son.
Luckily, l know just how to fix it.

14:22.482 --> 14:26.157
So how are you feeling?
The milk starting to take the sting out?

14:26.242 --> 14:30.155
Yeah, actually it is. How much longer
do l have to stay in here?

14:30.242 --> 14:32.119
Mamaw said a couple of hours,

14:32.202 --> 14:36.195
but don't worry,
l brought you a little snack.

14:44.682 --> 14:48.834
Come on, Rock.
lt's time for your just desserts.

14:58.162 --> 14:59.754
Are you sure?

15:04.082 --> 15:05.561
Good choice.

15:09.522 --> 15:12.355
l could've stuck with weddings
and bar mitzvahs, but no,

15:12.442 --> 15:14.512
l had to go for glamour.

15:17.402 --> 15:20.075
-That's it, l'm out of here.
-Lilly, no!

15:20.162 --> 15:22.881
What? l don't look good
in strawberry-cream pie!

15:22.962 --> 15:26.159
And l am not gonna look good with
that big old honking Miley necklace

15:26.242 --> 15:27.834
on the cover of that rag.

15:27.922 --> 15:30.311
Now, suck it up, we're going in.

15:43.522 --> 15:49.438
-Can l help you?
-Actually, we are here to help you.

15:49.522 --> 15:56.155
We are your complimentary mani-pedi,
hair and facial specialists, Mr...

15:59.122 --> 16:00.441
The Rock.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.801
The Rock.

16:06.042 --> 16:07.191
Little bit of an airhead,

16:07.282 --> 16:09.352
but she's the Picasso
of pimple-popping.

16:09.442 --> 16:11.000
lsn't that right, Lillian?

16:11.082 --> 16:14.677
That's right. No muss, no fuss, no pus.
That's me.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.553
And l don't like pie.

16:20.882 --> 16:22.361
Well, listen, ladies,
l really appreciate it,

16:22.442 --> 16:25.400
but l don't have time for this, so sorry.

16:25.482 --> 16:29.555
Good gracious, look at those cuticles.

16:31.162 --> 16:34.677
You do not know
how close you came to a hangnail,

16:34.762 --> 16:37.151
my little box-office sensation.

16:37.242 --> 16:38.561
Well, l am gonna see
my mom a little later,

16:38.642 --> 16:40.200
so l guess a quick buff wouldn't hurt.

16:41.802 --> 16:45.158
-Maybe even a little clear coat.
-Now we're talking!

16:48.042 --> 16:50.840
Now, we will take care of everything,

16:50.922 --> 16:54.597
so just relax, close your little eyes,

16:54.682 --> 16:58.231
and make sure you keep them closed
until the treatment's done.

16:58.322 --> 17:00.711
Early opening could be hazardous
to your health.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.121
And ours.

17:03.882 --> 17:06.077
-Promise?
-l promise.

17:06.162 --> 17:07.595
Pinky swear?

17:09.962 --> 17:11.599
That's a pinky?

17:16.321 --> 17:20.917
This feels like more than a clear coat.
Remember, it's got to look natural.

17:21.002 --> 17:23.277
Trust me, they look perfect.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.516
Why are you still putting stuff
on my lips?

17:32.602 --> 17:34.718
l'm trying to save them.

17:34.802 --> 17:39.751
They're dryer than the Sahara Desert
in the summer.

17:39.882 --> 17:41.952
-Lillian.
-Yeah, and blot.

17:45.602 --> 17:49.277
Well, that tastes good. What is that?
ls that strawberry?

17:50.242 --> 17:56.158
And now,
for a relaxing earlobe massage.

17:56.242 --> 18:00.872
You might feel a slight pressure.
That's normal.

18:02.122 --> 18:05.671
You do not know how much tension
builds up in those lobes, honey.

18:05.762 --> 18:07.718
That's working. That's it.

18:07.802 --> 18:09.713
-Yeah.
-That's the one.

18:10.962 --> 18:12.953
-And now for the best part.
-Great.

18:13.042 --> 18:17.433
A Himalayan temple massage.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.874
Rocky likey.

18:35.362 --> 18:38.434
What are you...
What are you putting on my head?

18:38.522 --> 18:42.754
Nothing. lt's just a hair follicle

18:42.842 --> 18:46.357
extenuator thing.

18:46.442 --> 18:49.036
-Well, what does it do?
-You'll see.

18:49.802 --> 18:55.957
Okay, and open your eyes
in three, two, one.

19:00.482 --> 19:01.801
Run!

19:02.322 --> 19:04.916
Hey! What... Oh, my...

19:06.402 --> 19:09.633
Hey, can't you people
just ever give me a break?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.074
Run, run!

19:17.962 --> 19:22.001
l can't go out there. Look at me.
l look like Grandma Rock.

19:25.242 --> 19:28.678
-Come on, Miley. Run!
-l can't do it.

19:29.402 --> 19:33.190
Left, right, left, right.
lt's just like walking, but faster!

19:34.002 --> 19:35.276
No.

19:36.642 --> 19:38.519
l can't sell this picture.

19:38.602 --> 19:40.354
l've been on the other side
of the camera.

19:40.442 --> 19:42.239
l know what it feels like.

19:42.322 --> 19:43.516
lf l don't give him a break,

19:43.602 --> 19:45.718
how can l expect anyone
to give me one?

19:45.802 --> 19:47.952
But what about your secret?

19:48.322 --> 19:50.790
l'd rather have everyone know
l was Hannah Montana

19:50.882 --> 19:54.192
than know l was just as slimy
as those paparazzi.

19:58.002 --> 20:00.755
l'm not decent!

20:00.842 --> 20:02.116
lt's us.

20:08.122 --> 20:10.795
You're not getting the earrings back.

20:11.122 --> 20:15.081
Actually, l just wanted to say
this was wrong and sorry.

20:15.602 --> 20:17.638
And for the record,
l knew it was wrong the whole time.

20:17.722 --> 20:18.916
Okay.

20:20.002 --> 20:22.675
-Why'd you do it?
-Long story.

20:25.082 --> 20:28.199
You can explain it
while you're de-clawing me.

20:33.122 --> 20:36.000
So all this started
just because you wanted a Z-Phone?

20:36.082 --> 20:40.234
Yeah. l guess l just got so caught up
in having the next new thing.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.880
You know, Miley, there's always
gonna be something new

20:41.962 --> 20:43.554
coming around the corner.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.951
Hey, that's what my mom says.

20:46.682 --> 20:48.240
Not that you remind me of my mom.

20:48.322 --> 20:52.156
You know, except for the nails,
because these are her nails.

20:55.402 --> 20:58.951
Here's your picture back.
l really am sorry.

21:03.362 --> 21:04.590
Come on, Lilly. Let's go.

21:04.682 --> 21:06.559
But, Miley, without the Rock picture,

21:06.642 --> 21:09.076
how are we gonna get
the Hannah picture back?

21:09.162 --> 21:10.834
Guess we're not.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.674
ls there some kind of problem?

21:13.762 --> 21:17.471
Yeah, but it's my problem.
l've bothered you enough.

21:17.562 --> 21:20.713
-Well, hold on, maybe l can help.
-Really?

21:21.362 --> 21:23.318
Well, sure,
you did the right thing by me.

21:23.402 --> 21:26.758
And that was the best facial
l've ever had.

21:27.882 --> 21:30.555
l mean, look at me. Am l not glowing?

21:32.922 --> 21:37.916
Well, in that case,
maybe there is something you can do.

21:40.362 --> 21:42.796
Thanks for finally giving me
my picture back.

21:42.882 --> 21:46.033
Well, after l thought about it,

21:47.042 --> 21:49.840
l figured it was the right thing to do.

21:50.282 --> 21:51.715
Good choice.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.842
Hey, Jackson.
You can probably get out now.

21:58.922 --> 22:01.880
That's okay. l'm kind of enjoying it.

22:01.962 --> 22:03.759
Aren't you getting lonesome out there?

22:03.842 --> 22:06.310
Actually, l made some new friends.

22:08.322 --> 22:11.678
Slow down, Tiger,
you're gonna get a tummy ache.

22:13.202 --> 22:15.955
Sure hope nobody's lactose intolerant.

22:18.282 --> 22:21.797
And, Boots, you're making a mess.
What are you, a dog?

22:22.522 --> 22:23.796
Sorry.
