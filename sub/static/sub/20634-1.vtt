"Five years ago."

02:06.501 --> 02:09.126
- Bastard!
- Go to hell.

02:30.167 --> 02:30.959
Help!

02:31.084 --> 02:32.459
Put out the fire!

02:56.084 --> 02:59.167
"Today."

03:35.709 --> 03:38.126
Jane, Jane...

03:59.251 --> 04:02.251
Jane, you ok?

04:02.751 --> 04:04.792
It hurts.

04:15.459 --> 04:17.916
Make way, make way.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.751
Your sister is stable now, however Mr. Lin,

04:30.917 --> 04:32.417
about her cancer treatment...

04:32.459 --> 04:34.709
we're incapable of further diagnosis.

04:36.126 --> 04:36.751
What do you mean?

04:36.792 --> 04:37.751
Calm down, would you?

04:40.792 --> 04:42.667
Sir...

04:42.751 --> 04:43.751
Don't touch me!

04:43.876 --> 04:45.667
Calm down, sir...

04:49.417 --> 04:51.001
What's wrong with me?

04:54.626 --> 04:56.292
What illness do I have?

05:13.292 --> 05:15.334
Are my days numbered?

05:19.876 --> 05:22.459
The Doctor said we could go to this place.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.834
This professor is our only option.

05:32.334 --> 05:34.501
They're all full of crap.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.584
Listen, you're not going to die.

05:48.126 --> 05:50.417
Take it slow.

05:51.584 --> 05:52.751
Jia!

05:52.834 --> 05:54.834
There's plenty of time!

05:57.251 --> 05:58.209
Thoughtless driving!

05:58.459 --> 06:00.542
Get out, show me your license.

06:20.501 --> 06:24.584
You've given me the best, don't take it away.

06:32.959 --> 06:40.917
"Sky One,
building height 888 metres, 168 floors."

06:59.792 --> 07:01.209
Done.

07:01.876 --> 07:04.542
You're looking great lately, Uncle.

07:04.751 --> 07:06.667
A shot every six months,

07:07.126 --> 07:09.209
I guarantee you'll live to a hundred.

07:10.167 --> 07:11.376
I don't mind dying,

07:11.501 --> 07:12.542
Can go see your mom sooner.

07:12.584 --> 07:15.001
You can almost run now, Dad

07:15.042 --> 07:16.584
the end is a long way off.

07:16.959 --> 07:18.959
Come for dinner, Uncle.

07:19.084 --> 07:19.959
Sure.

08:19.042 --> 08:20.376
Pull over.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.292
Back to the car.

08:32.958 --> 08:34.292
We're with Sky One.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.458
That makes you special?

08:38.042 --> 08:39.083
Hurry up.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.417
It's so slow...

08:50.334 --> 08:51.042
David.

08:53.584 --> 08:54.209
Speaking.

08:54.292 --> 08:56.209
You must not open the rear door of the truck.

08:56.251 --> 08:57.209
Is that clear?

08:57.667 --> 08:58.542
Copy that.

08:58.792 --> 09:00.584
Rei, get me the Director of Security.

09:00.667 --> 09:01.626
Okay.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.792
David, check their ID.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.209
Copy.

09:06.876 --> 09:08.292
Show me your badges.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.001
Drop the gun.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.501
Open the back.

09:13.042 --> 09:13.959
David,

09:14.042 --> 09:15.584
he asks to open the rear door.

09:16.626 --> 09:17.626
Ignore him.

09:17.751 --> 09:18.709
Stay there.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.251
Almost there... almost...

09:22.126 --> 09:23.251
Go help him.

09:23.584 --> 09:24.917
Show me your ID.

09:29.459 --> 09:30.501
Get down.

09:31.167 --> 09:31.917
What's going on?

09:32.417 --> 09:33.417
Stay in the car...

09:34.001 --> 09:35.334
It's not your concern.

09:35.459 --> 09:36.167
Sit still.

09:37.876 --> 09:38.834
Got it.

09:40.376 --> 09:41.417
What's wrong?

09:41.501 --> 09:42.834
Radio interference, sir.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.876
Switch channel, get me a clear image.

09:56.667 --> 09:57.459
Get down.

09:57.709 --> 09:58.501
Get down.

10:04.542 --> 10:05.792
Where's the Director?

10:08.376 --> 10:09.376
Freeze.

10:29.667 --> 10:30.626
Get up.

10:30.667 --> 10:31.792
Get into the car.

10:32.709 --> 10:33.709
Don't move.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.001
Don't move.

10:36.959 --> 10:37.876
Stay still.

10:43.084 --> 10:44.584
Ziwan, run.

10:45.084 --> 10:46.501
Don't call names.

10:48.084 --> 10:49.209
Into the truck.

10:49.292 --> 10:50.542
Let's split!

10:53.167 --> 10:54.334
Hurry Up!

10:54.376 --> 10:55.209
Go!

11:02.376 --> 11:03.792
I have the Director.

11:03.834 --> 11:05.084
Forget it!

11:05.584 --> 11:07.084
There's a signal from the truck,

11:07.209 --> 11:08.709
on Channel 3.6, sir.

11:08.917 --> 11:10.417
Give me the tracker.

11:10.626 --> 11:13.126
Professor Lee, the siblings are still waiting.

11:13.709 --> 11:14.667
Daisy,

11:14.709 --> 11:15.667
I've told them.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.126
I'm swamped.

11:18.459 --> 11:20.542
They're hoping you can save a life.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.834
Tell them to leave.

11:23.001 --> 11:24.834
Has the truck arrived yet?

11:25.209 --> 11:27.126
In the upper carpark.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.292
Excuse me Professor,

11:30.292 --> 11:31.501
can we see you...

11:32.876 --> 11:36.292
I'm sorry, i really have no time.

11:37.459 --> 11:40.251
Can you please call him again?

11:40.751 --> 11:41.584
I'm starving,

11:41.584 --> 11:42.876
- Let's go.
- We'll wait.

11:42.959 --> 11:45.626
Excuse me... could you...

11:45.792 --> 11:48.792
he doesn't want to see us, let's go.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.209
If there's a will,

11:50.209 --> 11:51.917
there's a way, we wait.

11:52.292 --> 11:56.084
Who cares, i'm dying anyway.

11:59.459 --> 12:01.251
Whatever...

12:21.584 --> 12:23.209
We're the security team from Sky One

12:23.417 --> 12:25.417
we're following the truck that just arrived.

12:50.417 --> 12:51.876
Ex-Stem Cells...

12:52.084 --> 12:53.584
such a beauty.

13:07.167 --> 13:08.751
Stay here.

13:17.501 --> 13:19.001
Hey Cousin, what's up?

13:19.126 --> 13:21.126
A Sky One team is here... hello?

13:21.167 --> 13:22.709
Freeze.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.084
Stop the car!

13:55.376 --> 13:56.292
Stop it!

14:16.501 --> 14:18.126
Freeze.

14:20.751 --> 14:22.042
Don't move.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.042
Daisy, something's wrong in the carpark.

14:26.209 --> 14:27.292
Call the police now.

14:31.251 --> 14:32.917
I don't know how to shoot.

14:34.084 --> 14:35.417
Get out.

14:52.542 --> 14:53.709
Don't shoot!

14:53.792 --> 14:55.376
These Ex-Stem Cells are...

14:55.459 --> 14:58.042
the most precious thing in my life.

14:58.251 --> 14:59.542
Stay with them then.

15:01.626 --> 15:02.626
No...

15:02.876 --> 15:04.042
open the door.

15:05.834 --> 15:07.626
It's dangerous here.

15:15.501 --> 15:16.917
I know you.

15:17.251 --> 15:19.042
You're the son of Prof. Pan.

15:20.251 --> 15:22.042
Those Ex-Stem Cells are mine.

15:40.667 --> 15:41.709
Freeze.

15:42.501 --> 15:43.251
Get out.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.626
Jia!

16:26.001 --> 16:27.167
Freeze.

16:27.709 --> 16:29.042
Drive away.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.167
Do you know what's inside the truck?

16:44.626 --> 16:46.084
I don't care what's back there.

16:46.292 --> 16:48.167
I only need Prof. Lee to help my sister.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.126
Prof. Lee...

16:51.626 --> 16:52.709
Prof. Lee?

16:52.876 --> 16:54.417
Can you hear me, professor?

16:54.667 --> 16:56.084
Prof. Lee!

16:57.334 --> 17:00.667
This might help.

17:02.501 --> 17:04.791
Can you hear me, professor?

17:05.126 --> 17:06.834
Prof. Lee?

17:08.501 --> 17:10.001
Ziwan?

17:10.126 --> 17:11.376
Is that Ziwan?

17:12.334 --> 17:13.876
Yes, are you alright?

17:14.166 --> 17:16.876
How did they find us at the lab?

17:17.291 --> 17:18.584
I have no clue.

17:19.416 --> 17:21.626
Could be a tracking device.

17:33.376 --> 17:35.167
Tracking device...

17:36.959 --> 17:39.126
obvioulsy it's hidden somewhere!

17:41.251 --> 17:42.584
Smart-ass, are you?

17:42.876 --> 17:47.084
He used to be a mechanic at the army.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.834
In the Army?

17:49.376 --> 17:50.667
Try this then.

17:54.459 --> 17:56.417
Expect a real gun from a phony cop?

18:20.876 --> 18:22.167
Morning Mr. Tang.

18:27.959 --> 18:29.584
It's been a while.

18:32.376 --> 18:34.959
Do you know who stole my Ex-Stem Cells?

18:43.376 --> 18:44.709
It's Ziwan.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.334
He's like a tumor.

18:48.584 --> 18:50.209
He's our mentor's son.

18:50.251 --> 18:53.042
I need to respect a corpse now?

18:53.251 --> 18:54.626
Are you two connected?

18:55.126 --> 18:56.917
We've married so many years,

18:57.376 --> 18:58.917
and now you doubted me?

18:59.042 --> 19:01.542
Everything I do is our future.

19:02.001 --> 19:04.959
You do that only for my research.

19:12.292 --> 19:14.084
The chief Security Officer is here.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.417
Send him in.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.084
Mr. Tang.

19:23.459 --> 19:24.584
Are you aware that,

19:24.751 --> 19:26.709
the stolen cells can be

19:27.126 --> 19:28.584
developed into advanced medications.

19:29.709 --> 19:31.292
I will get it back.

19:31.459 --> 19:32.792
I want no police involvement...

19:33.126 --> 19:35.042
This was classified.

19:35.501 --> 19:37.626
I suspect it's an inside job.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.501
Once we controlled the medications

19:43.626 --> 19:45.167
the life and fortune of these moneybags,

19:45.292 --> 19:46.667
will be in my hands.

19:46.709 --> 19:48.876
All you talk about is money.

19:49.042 --> 19:51.334
Who doesn't love money?

19:51.542 --> 19:52.751
What's in you mind?

19:52.876 --> 19:55.084
I'm thinking what you used to be.

19:57.001 --> 19:58.292
You think too much.

20:09.001 --> 20:10.459
Yes...

20:10.667 --> 20:11.834
Found it.

20:12.251 --> 20:13.417
I have it...

20:13.667 --> 20:15.626
I'm bringing the medical history.

20:17.084 --> 20:19.542
Tell me when we get there.

20:21.292 --> 20:22.126
Doctor,

20:22.251 --> 20:24.251
my sister can be a guinea pig.

20:24.584 --> 20:26.126
We have enough guinea pigs.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.667
To be honest,

20:27.709 --> 20:29.542
only Sky Clinic can cure her.

20:29.709 --> 20:31.209
Cancer is their specialty.

20:31.292 --> 20:32.709
Heard of Ex-Stem Cells?

20:32.792 --> 20:35.376
They can rejuvenate
and replicate any damgaed organ,

20:35.501 --> 20:36.792
a remedy for all cancers.

20:37.209 --> 20:38.126
For many years,

20:38.167 --> 20:39.084
doctors were unable to control

20:39.126 --> 20:41.251
the ultimate form of Ex-Stem Cells.

20:41.751 --> 20:43.501
But the technology at Sky Clinic

20:43.917 --> 20:45.501
have proved sucessful.

20:47.334 --> 20:49.084
What are you looking at?

20:50.042 --> 20:52.417
Are you feeling pity for a dying person...

20:52.459 --> 20:54.542
or afraid of me?

21:01.251 --> 21:04.376
You'd look like a doctor if you wore a gown.

21:08.626 --> 21:11.542
I'd look like a Korean idol without glasses.

21:12.376 --> 21:14.167
Let's put on some lipstick

21:14.167 --> 21:15.584
to perfect it.

21:20.334 --> 21:23.542
Wanna try it with mine.

21:28.626 --> 21:31.084
"If I don't do it..."

21:44.292 --> 21:47.167
"... who will?"

21:53.834 --> 21:55.292
Technology is what our country needs,

21:55.876 --> 21:57.626
as well as talents.

21:58.042 --> 21:59.792
You're our future.

23:20.667 --> 23:23.126
You're always in time.

23:24.709 --> 23:26.084
Thanks to this...

23:26.751 --> 23:28.417
heartbeat tracker.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.251
Don't call the police.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.167
It's not easy to die

23:42.709 --> 23:45.542
with today's technology.

23:45.709 --> 23:48.376
That's why, you're important to us.

23:51.417 --> 23:52.126
Get the first-aid kit.

23:52.334 --> 23:53.167
Now!

23:54.334 --> 23:54.834
Quickly!

24:05.001 --> 24:07.292
The Ex-Stem Cells technology has succeeded.

24:08.501 --> 24:09.917
It's time for me to leave.

24:35.834 --> 24:37.709
Staying alive is pointless.

24:41.417 --> 24:44.251
When there's no love.

24:59.126 --> 25:00.751
What's bothering you?

25:00.917 --> 25:02.042
Got dumped?

25:02.542 --> 25:03.834
Ko Yu tried to kill herself.

25:04.334 --> 25:05.376
But failed.

25:05.501 --> 25:07.251
Brighten up,

25:07.834 --> 25:10.584
with the success of the Ex-Stem Cells

25:10.751 --> 25:13.834
you'll soon be a billionaire.

25:14.376 --> 25:17.376
Stop teasing me, Uncle Cai.

25:17.876 --> 25:19.001
Are you out of your mind?

25:19.417 --> 25:22.501
I won't let others to take control of my life.

25:23.334 --> 25:25.417
I own Sky One.

25:25.667 --> 25:28.501
Tang dares to eat me alive.

25:29.084 --> 25:31.667
Stealing the Ex-Stem Cells for himself.

25:32.084 --> 25:33.417
Sir, time for medicine.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.751
Three times a day,

25:37.042 --> 25:38.959
i'm tired of these pills.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.667
All I want to know is who killed my father.

25:41.834 --> 25:42.792
Same here.

25:43.084 --> 25:44.459
That fire took too many lives.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.251
My team was dismissed because of it,

25:46.292 --> 25:47.417
we have to crack this case.

25:47.459 --> 25:49.001
Calm down.

25:51.251 --> 25:53.251
You can't make much being a cop anyway.

25:53.459 --> 25:55.501
Next thing you know it's retirememt.

26:04.792 --> 26:06.667
I'd like to meet with your Chief Security Officer.

26:06.792 --> 26:08.417
What's that, sir?

26:08.584 --> 26:10.751
Tracker device. They'd know.

26:29.792 --> 26:31.709
We'll settle our score later.

26:52.459 --> 26:53.626
Water for her,

26:54.084 --> 26:55.584
coffee for me.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.126
Why'd they help us?

27:00.292 --> 27:02.042
There are some people with good hearts.

27:02.376 --> 27:04.959
You mustn't trade Ziwan as exchange.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.209
Of course not.

27:08.792 --> 27:09.584
He's the one

27:09.667 --> 27:11.084
who demands to see you.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.292
Can you cure cancer?

27:16.751 --> 27:18.334
I can.

27:18.751 --> 27:21.084
I can help you get back the truck.

27:21.501 --> 27:23.501
Hand over Ziwan too.

27:25.501 --> 27:27.167
I just want to see him.

27:30.584 --> 27:31.709
Alright.

27:32.792 --> 27:34.376
But I need a guarantee.

27:34.667 --> 27:37.001
Your sister can start treatment right away.

27:48.209 --> 27:49.834
I'm counting on you.

27:50.584 --> 27:52.834
As long as you can cure her.

27:54.167 --> 27:55.959
I will do whatever it takes.

27:58.001 --> 27:59.709
We need to test your blood type,

28:00.251 --> 28:02.834
transfusions between siblings
can reduce rejection.

28:03.959 --> 28:06.126
We are not biologically related.

28:09.917 --> 28:11.876
Please follow me for your checkup.

28:19.751 --> 28:23.417
Marco... hand... sit...

28:25.334 --> 28:26.417
- Marco...
- Good boy.

28:41.292 --> 28:42.709
So who will handle Ziwan?

28:43.001 --> 28:44.084
Mr. Tang.

28:44.251 --> 28:46.167
I don't get what you're saying.

28:46.751 --> 28:48.626
I will send someone.

28:48.834 --> 28:51.126
All you need is to bring back the truck.

28:53.584 --> 28:55.292
Can you make sure nobody gets hurt?

28:55.584 --> 28:57.751
Do you want to save your sister?

29:11.501 --> 29:12.167
Hello?

29:12.376 --> 29:13.542
Sorry, something happened.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.209
I'm with my sister at Sky Clinic.

29:15.334 --> 29:16.292
They're holding us.

29:17.084 --> 29:18.459
Someone wants to meet you.

29:20.751 --> 29:22.251
Where?

29:22.459 --> 29:24.167
Where your dad was burnt to death.

29:26.834 --> 29:28.292
Who was that?

29:30.542 --> 29:31.167
What's up?

29:31.251 --> 29:32.209
Be right back.

29:37.167 --> 29:39.292
Stay... good boy... sit.

29:41.209 --> 29:42.292
Where are you going?

29:42.792 --> 29:44.501
Nothing... he'll be back soon.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.501
Who's that?

29:54.751 --> 29:55.876
No idea.

29:57.917 --> 29:59.042
You're done here.

29:59.417 --> 30:00.501
Go.

30:02.251 --> 30:03.626
Where do you think you're going?

30:05.501 --> 30:06.417
Go.

30:10.751 --> 30:11.917
Take care...

30:12.334 --> 30:13.792
of my car.

30:22.334 --> 30:23.792
I'm in charge here.

30:24.751 --> 30:26.459
We'll see.

30:32.667 --> 30:33.209
So?

30:33.292 --> 30:34.126
Did you reach Ziwan yet?

30:34.167 --> 30:35.042
No answer.

30:39.084 --> 30:40.084
Get in the car.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.292
Hin!

31:17.376 --> 31:18.584
I'm here for Poon Ziwan.

31:21.667 --> 31:22.542
Is that you?

31:29.417 --> 31:30.084
Hey!

31:30.626 --> 31:32.084
He just left.

31:35.084 --> 31:36.459
You let him go?

31:39.542 --> 31:40.584
Bring them all in.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.542
In the house.

31:42.626 --> 31:43.459
Go.

31:43.542 --> 31:44.417
Hurry.

31:48.876 --> 31:50.209
Where is the truck?

31:51.001 --> 31:53.376
At... the backyard.

31:56.251 --> 31:57.542
You drive the truck back,

31:57.709 --> 31:58.876
and no other business here.

32:09.834 --> 32:11.084
On the floor!

32:18.292 --> 32:19.001
Sweetie,

32:19.376 --> 32:20.542
do you know Poon Ziwan?

32:22.209 --> 32:23.584
Tell him to come back.

32:30.584 --> 32:31.501
I'll do it.

32:32.542 --> 32:33.709
Don't call.

32:35.542 --> 32:37.209
I'm in charge here.

32:38.751 --> 32:40.792
Are you longing for a vacation?

33:35.042 --> 33:35.792
Fatty.

33:36.042 --> 33:36.667
Call the police.

33:36.709 --> 33:37.376
Okay.

33:38.292 --> 33:39.667
Shall we wait for the police then?

34:16.958 --> 34:17.917
Dad.

34:18.917 --> 34:20.292
I'm back.

34:41.042 --> 34:43.001
It's been a while.

34:53.417 --> 34:55.083
It's been five years.

34:55.458 --> 34:57.876
And I can still feel the heat of the fire.

34:58.501 --> 34:59.584
Your father...

35:00.167 --> 35:02.042
was a remarkable scientist.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.417
He was murdered.

35:05.209 --> 35:07.501
That fire was an accident.

35:16.626 --> 35:19.001
That's what you think?

35:20.334 --> 35:23.417
Then how on earth you can continue the research?

35:25.001 --> 35:28.084
You can't carry on without dad's notebook.

35:33.834 --> 35:37.126
That notebook contained all
his research on Ex-Stem Cells.

35:37.501 --> 35:40.376
The autopsy report said his head got smack.

35:40.501 --> 35:43.334
If it was an accident,
where the hell is this notebook?

35:44.084 --> 35:46.001
It was probably lost in the fire too.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.334
Ziwan, don't you see.

35:48.417 --> 35:50.792
I'm also a victim of that accident.

35:54.292 --> 35:55.876
Why did you trick me into coming?

35:55.959 --> 35:56.959
Whoever took the notebook

35:56.959 --> 35:58.001
is the murderer.

35:58.084 --> 35:59.376
You think I don't understand?

36:00.209 --> 36:02.501
Since my mentor's death,

36:02.792 --> 36:06.167
I've continued Ex-Stem Cells research...

36:07.001 --> 36:09.292
I wanted to fulfill his last wish.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.292
You're his only son...

36:13.084 --> 36:14.876
You will be the sole heir.

36:16.376 --> 36:19.126
If you want me to trust you,

36:21.042 --> 36:22.834
cure his sister.

36:26.167 --> 36:27.417
Ziman.

36:30.334 --> 36:31.959
How could you let him go?

36:32.084 --> 36:33.667
And you pointed a gun at your own people.

36:33.751 --> 36:35.417
Are you out of your mind?

36:35.584 --> 36:37.126
Remember when your wife died,

36:37.251 --> 36:38.751
it was me who saved your dad.

36:38.876 --> 36:40.834
I made you the Chief Security Officer...

36:41.459 --> 36:44.042
what did you say your lifetime goal was?

36:45.501 --> 36:46.959
Promise me...

36:48.126 --> 36:50.167
Take good care of yourself...

37:16.376 --> 37:18.251
I swear to protect the Ex-Stem Cells research.

37:18.459 --> 37:21.626
In doing any great deed, there's sacrifice.

37:21.792 --> 37:23.251
Ex-Stem Cells

37:24.084 --> 37:25.542
is for saving people.

37:26.501 --> 37:27.959
Not to kill.

37:28.876 --> 37:30.751
Can I still trust you?

37:32.084 --> 37:33.834
- Bastard!
- Go to hell.

38:12.001 --> 38:13.459
I do...

38:50.667 --> 38:52.209
What happened?

38:52.542 --> 38:54.959
Commander, he couldn't identify the armed robbers.

38:55.459 --> 38:57.917
Tell me what happened.

38:58.209 --> 38:59.292
Where have you been?

38:59.334 --> 39:00.751
Stop it.

39:03.542 --> 39:06.376
They've taken away the truck.

39:09.709 --> 39:12.584
She was aggitated and wanted to leave.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.959
- She's gone when I returned
- Shut up.

39:15.001 --> 39:16.626
Where the hell is my sister?

39:20.084 --> 39:21.459
- You can't get in here
- That's my dog.

39:34.167 --> 39:35.126
Marco.

40:22.709 --> 40:25.042
Marco was a gift from my father.

40:26.167 --> 40:28.626
He never had time for me,

40:29.001 --> 40:31.834
because he was too busy saving mankind.

40:33.626 --> 40:36.376
Now they're both gone.

40:37.459 --> 40:40.084
This is destiny.

40:40.667 --> 40:42.042
Jane.

40:47.626 --> 40:50.042
You brought them to ambush us.

40:52.584 --> 40:53.792
Didn't you?

40:54.251 --> 40:55.251
Is that true?

40:56.084 --> 40:57.167
What did you promise me? Why....

40:57.209 --> 40:58.709
I did everything for you.

40:59.542 --> 41:01.417
You're one of them, aren't you?

41:06.917 --> 41:08.251
Don't fight.

41:10.209 --> 41:11.542
Don't fight.

41:11.792 --> 41:12.876
Stop.

41:13.042 --> 41:14.834
Stop it! Stop fighting!

41:14.959 --> 41:15.876
Don't move.

41:17.001 --> 41:19.126
He's an accomplice in the robbery.

41:19.709 --> 41:21.167
Come to the police station for investigation.

41:21.292 --> 41:22.167
Hey!

41:22.209 --> 41:23.417
Don't arrest him.

41:23.667 --> 41:24.584
He's done nothing wrong.

41:24.626 --> 41:26.709
He's not a bad person.

41:27.542 --> 41:29.501
Listen to me... Go back to the clinic.

41:29.584 --> 41:30.751
Back to the clinic.

41:31.251 --> 41:32.751
Listen! Go Back Now!

41:32.792 --> 41:35.126
He's innocent, not a criminal.

41:35.709 --> 41:36.917
Back to the clinic, now!

41:37.251 --> 41:38.251
Take me with you too.

41:38.334 --> 41:40.959
I'm with him, take me too.

41:41.126 --> 41:43.459
Jia... take me with you.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.126
Jia...

41:53.542 --> 41:55.501
I... I need my medicine.

42:14.834 --> 42:15.959
Thank you.

42:18.626 --> 42:20.001
They're back at the hostel.

42:20.209 --> 42:21.542
There are cops too...

42:29.792 --> 42:31.917
due to the condition of the case,

42:32.042 --> 42:33.584
we have a search warrant.

42:33.709 --> 42:34.751
Do you want to see?

42:34.792 --> 42:35.667
She's just here for her medicine,

42:35.667 --> 42:36.751
she's sick.

42:39.751 --> 42:41.001
What happened to her brother?

42:41.959 --> 42:43.251
We're keeping him for custody...

42:43.417 --> 42:44.834
for our investigation.

42:53.167 --> 42:53.959
Rei.

42:54.167 --> 42:55.584
- Sign for it.
- Okay.

42:57.626 --> 42:58.751
Hold it...

43:00.001 --> 43:02.751
don't send the Ex-Stem Cells to the lab.

43:02.959 --> 43:05.167
Keep it down here, with a power supply.

43:05.209 --> 43:06.709
Tinbo, a word with you...

43:10.584 --> 43:11.917
Ziwan is in danger.

43:12.292 --> 43:14.001
You must gurantee his safety

43:14.292 --> 43:15.292
as well as Jane.

43:15.584 --> 43:17.417
Her diagnosis is end-stage cancer.

43:17.959 --> 43:19.959
Treatment should start right away.

43:20.501 --> 43:21.917
Mr Tang has other orders.

43:22.167 --> 43:23.584
Who should I listen to?

43:24.084 --> 43:25.626
Listen to your heart.

43:35.709 --> 43:36.376
Where are they?

43:36.417 --> 43:37.542
Inside the temple.

43:37.959 --> 43:39.042
Back up.

43:48.209 --> 43:52.876
- Hello?
- Ziwan, this is Tinbo.

43:53.792 --> 43:54.709
I know who you are.

43:54.751 --> 43:57.292
Beware of attack, you're being followed.

43:57.542 --> 43:59.709
You're Tang's running dog.

43:59.834 --> 44:01.959
When his dog barks, i'll be cautious.

44:02.542 --> 44:03.376
Where are you?

44:23.959 --> 44:26.292
So many wishes...
Even God can't remember them all.

44:26.667 --> 44:29.709
I pray for a simple life,
is it too much to ask for?

44:42.292 --> 44:43.751
Hold it.

44:44.626 --> 44:48.042
Wait by the motorcyle, my turn to pray.

45:08.834 --> 45:10.209
Let's go.

45:37.251 --> 45:38.709
Wolf, don't shoot! It's me.

45:51.542 --> 45:52.792
Be quick, on the bike.

45:53.501 --> 45:54.376
Go now.

45:55.584 --> 45:56.584
He's outside.

46:09.709 --> 46:10.709
Back to the car.

46:10.917 --> 46:11.876
Get the car.

47:17.542 --> 47:19.209
He's here to bail you out.

47:24.167 --> 47:26.501
Your sister is terminally ill.

47:26.542 --> 47:28.376
She needs treatment immediately.

47:29.209 --> 47:30.376
What's the catch?

47:30.417 --> 47:31.251
To...

47:31.709 --> 47:33.042
make sure she gets cured.

47:34.751 --> 47:36.167
Grew a conscience?

47:40.751 --> 47:42.376
- Where's he?
- He's inside.

47:47.001 --> 47:48.667
I'm responsible for your safety.

47:49.626 --> 47:50.917
Tin really did chew him out.

47:52.584 --> 47:54.501
I've got to have some privacy too.

47:59.792 --> 48:01.376
I'm confiscating your bike key.

48:08.042 --> 48:09.334
It's fine.

48:12.209 --> 48:14.251
- Hello?
- Hello?

48:14.542 --> 48:15.584
Jane?

48:16.834 --> 48:17.876
Hello?

48:20.751 --> 48:21.917
Where are you?

48:22.459 --> 48:24.251
Did you go to the clinic?

48:26.251 --> 48:28.209
I beg you, listen to me please.

48:29.417 --> 48:30.542
You there?

48:31.084 --> 48:32.001
Speak up!

48:32.626 --> 48:34.042
I nodded.

48:34.251 --> 48:35.334
You expect me to see that?

48:35.334 --> 48:36.459
Speak up!

48:37.584 --> 48:39.334
What do you want me to say?

48:40.084 --> 48:41.709
You can't betray friends because of me.

48:41.751 --> 48:42.834
I feel terrible...

48:42.876 --> 48:44.709
that you sold yourself out.

48:45.501 --> 48:46.876
Let's go home, ok?

48:46.959 --> 48:49.251
I don't wanna die here!

48:53.167 --> 48:54.751
Let's talk about this later.

49:06.959 --> 49:08.751
Hey.

49:09.251 --> 49:10.917
Your sister doesn't have much time left.

49:49.167 --> 49:50.126
Hey! Country boy.

49:50.334 --> 49:51.542
Do me a favor?

49:51.792 --> 49:53.126
I'm here for Poon Ziwan.

49:54.292 --> 49:55.876
I don't know where he is.

50:07.334 --> 50:08.626
Hello.

50:09.417 --> 50:12.751
Hello? Can you hear me?

50:13.876 --> 50:15.334
Speak up!

50:20.376 --> 50:22.084
Is he with her now?

50:23.501 --> 50:25.251
Hand me the phone.

50:25.417 --> 50:27.167
I'll get them for you.

50:32.084 --> 50:33.501
- Hello?
- Hello...

50:35.626 --> 50:36.542
Jia...

50:36.709 --> 50:38.084
Jia... Hello?

50:39.167 --> 50:41.626
What's happening there?

50:41.667 --> 50:42.501
Hello?

51:42.667 --> 51:43.209
Hello?

51:43.251 --> 51:44.501
Is Jia with you?

51:44.876 --> 51:45.626
No.

51:45.792 --> 51:47.417
He's being attacked, he's in trouble.

51:47.501 --> 51:48.292
What?

51:50.584 --> 51:51.376
I have to go back...

51:51.417 --> 51:52.459
- Where to?
- I'm going back...

51:52.834 --> 51:54.001
- You're not leaving
- Jia should be at the hostel.

51:54.126 --> 51:55.292
- I have to go back...
- You're not leaving.

51:55.417 --> 51:56.167
He's in trouble.

51:56.209 --> 51:58.126
Stay, you can't be of help.

51:58.292 --> 51:59.126
Call the police.

51:59.167 --> 51:59.917
No!

52:00.459 --> 52:01.376
Absolutely not!

53:41.209 --> 53:41.876
Wolf...

53:47.542 --> 53:49.084
Wolf...

54:12.501 --> 54:14.834
Hang in there, Wolf.

54:44.751 --> 54:47.376
I fear that I'll be fired.

54:51.126 --> 54:53.042
What will happen to my sister?

54:53.667 --> 54:55.542
You can only count on Ko Yu now.

54:57.959 --> 54:59.626
Jane cannot die...

55:01.834 --> 55:03.876
I was an orphan.

55:05.501 --> 55:07.542
Her dad offered me a family (Jia).

55:09.209 --> 55:11.584
And named me Jia (Family).

55:19.709 --> 55:21.959
Don't come down, it's dangerous!

55:23.209 --> 55:26.584
We have different moms,

55:26.792 --> 55:29.334
is it true that I can be your wife?

55:33.667 --> 55:35.167
When dad passed away,

55:36.626 --> 55:38.542
jane become everything to me.

55:40.626 --> 55:42.292
My wife...

55:42.834 --> 55:44.584
she died of cancer.

55:45.751 --> 55:47.376
I know your pain.

55:49.084 --> 55:52.501
The Ex-Stem Cells research must succeed.

55:55.751 --> 56:01.459
"Life is so fragille."

56:37.167 --> 56:39.584
It's been so long since we saw this.

56:51.251 --> 56:53.001
Jame, come in.

56:54.376 --> 56:55.709
Careful.

56:58.209 --> 57:00.084
Take this with you.

57:00.126 --> 57:02.209
- You not coming?
- Just go.

57:05.626 --> 57:07.001
Bye.

57:15.667 --> 57:18.084
Give me your hand.

57:20.876 --> 57:23.792
Hold it tight.

57:24.042 --> 57:27.417
Grasp onto what you want firmly...

57:28.626 --> 57:30.834
time doesn't wait for anyone.

57:32.876 --> 57:34.292
Open the door.

57:34.501 --> 57:36.501
We're going to Sky Clinic.

57:50.292 --> 57:51.751
Don't worry.

57:51.792 --> 57:53.834
She hasn't come out of anesthesia yet.

57:54.167 --> 57:57.126
I need to match the Ex-Stem Cells
to the impaired organ.

57:59.959 --> 58:01.001
Did you give her the injection?

58:01.126 --> 58:02.084
Not yet.

58:02.209 --> 58:04.501
We've just confirmed the type
of stem cell she needs.

58:04.542 --> 58:06.292
I've ordered the Ex-Stem Cells
from the blood vault.

58:14.042 --> 58:15.042
Doctor Yu...

58:15.667 --> 58:17.792
Security denied all entry to the blood vault.

58:29.792 --> 58:31.251
Ziwan claims that

58:31.292 --> 58:33.417
whoever has the notebook,

58:34.501 --> 58:36.334
is the murderer of our Mentor.

58:36.709 --> 58:38.292
Do you have our Mentor's notebook?

58:38.667 --> 58:39.917
Was that fire

58:40.959 --> 58:42.709
really an accident?

58:45.001 --> 58:47.334
David, i'm still the Chief Security Officer.

58:47.459 --> 58:49.292
Tell them not to deny me entry to the vault.

58:53.459 --> 58:54.584
Rei, you still there?

58:54.792 --> 58:55.417
Copy.

58:55.542 --> 58:57.251
This is an emergency.

58:59.459 --> 59:01.042
No admission to Blood Vault.

59:01.417 --> 59:02.626
Order from Mr. Tang.

59:02.834 --> 59:05.501
He's arrived, he'll see you two in his office.

59:08.167 --> 59:09.584
He's here.

59:12.417 --> 59:14.292
Told you it's an inside job!

59:14.542 --> 59:15.876
Traitors!

59:16.376 --> 59:18.084
I want the Blood Vault opened.

59:18.584 --> 59:19.709
Right now!

59:23.209 --> 59:24.376
Are you threatening me?

59:26.084 --> 59:28.251
You... you're fired.

59:28.542 --> 59:29.001
David.

59:29.126 --> 59:30.459
You take over his post from now on

59:30.626 --> 59:32.084
as Chief Security Officer.

59:33.626 --> 59:34.667
Yu.

59:34.834 --> 59:37.459
Don't defy me, are we clear?

59:57.084 --> 59:58.042
Wolf.

59:58.209 --> 01:00:00.001
You incompetent fool!

01:00:04.376 --> 01:00:05.376
Mr. Tang.

01:00:05.709 --> 01:00:08.334
May I remove these tumors now?

01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:11.251
Do it.

01:00:17.709 --> 01:00:19.001
Make way.

01:00:19.959 --> 01:00:21.167
Make way!

01:00:23.876 --> 01:00:25.459
This is my department.

01:00:25.667 --> 01:00:28.167
Get rid of him, i want to pass.

01:00:32.709 --> 01:00:33.626
Tinbo.

01:00:35.334 --> 01:00:35.917
Go.

01:00:37.584 --> 01:00:39.084
Tinbo's entering Blood Vault, sir.

01:00:39.251 --> 01:00:41.126
I'm not blind, i see that.

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.959
Open the door, Tinbo.

01:00:58.626 --> 01:00:59.834
I'm in charge of this department.

01:01:00.126 --> 01:01:01.834
I can go anywhere I want.

01:01:16.209 --> 01:01:17.834
You're trespassing on a private property.

01:01:21.876 --> 01:01:23.334
Arrest them, David.

01:01:23.459 --> 01:01:24.042
Tang.

01:01:24.459 --> 01:01:25.167
Give her the cure...

01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:26.876
and I'll tell you who is the mastermind behind us.

01:01:27.042 --> 01:01:28.292
Is it Uncle Cai?

01:01:29.126 --> 01:01:29.917
Take them.

01:01:30.084 --> 01:01:30.959
- Yes sir.
- You bastard.

01:01:36.376 --> 01:01:37.376
Try me.

01:01:37.584 --> 01:01:38.417
Get out.

01:01:41.709 --> 01:01:42.542
Get out.

01:01:45.959 --> 01:01:46.876
Jia.

01:01:50.167 --> 01:01:50.917
Get out!

01:01:51.126 --> 01:01:52.084
Stay calm.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.292
Can't you listen?

01:01:54.084 --> 01:01:55.334
Jia...

01:01:58.334 --> 01:02:00.251
Get the hell out... All of you.

01:02:02.459 --> 01:02:03.917
You son of a bitch.

01:02:05.626 --> 01:02:07.334
Don't shoot, be calm.

01:02:07.584 --> 01:02:08.751
We can talk.

01:02:09.209 --> 01:02:10.251
Make way.

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:12.376
Put the guns down.

01:02:32.042 --> 01:02:33.292
Tang.

01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:35.251
Tell them all to leave.

01:02:36.209 --> 01:02:38.042
I've got the serum.

01:02:38.292 --> 01:02:40.126
Bring me the wheelchair.

01:02:42.209 --> 01:02:42.959
Jia.

01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:47.167
Ziwan, take care of Jane.

01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:50.292
Tell them to go out!

01:02:50.417 --> 01:02:51.626
Out! All of you.

01:03:18.917 --> 01:03:20.626
Jia.

01:03:24.459 --> 01:03:25.917
Take care of her.

01:03:26.542 --> 01:03:28.626
Come go with us...

01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:30.084
Jia...

01:03:30.167 --> 01:03:31.501
Make way.

01:03:45.709 --> 01:03:47.584
Time's up!

01:03:47.751 --> 01:03:49.334
Don't you want me to die?

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:50.834
Keep me company then.

01:03:55.001 --> 01:03:57.792
Sir, shall we stop the elevator?

01:04:04.334 --> 01:04:05.376
Right away.

01:04:05.584 --> 01:04:07.001
To the carpark.

01:04:10.251 --> 01:04:11.501
Wait here.

01:04:11.542 --> 01:04:12.959
I'll go get my truck.

01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:36.542
Get in, they're here.

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:41.751
Turn around, now.

01:04:44.334 --> 01:04:46.042
Get in the car, Professor.

01:04:46.959 --> 01:04:47.792
Where's Ziwan?

01:04:47.876 --> 01:04:49.251
In his own truck.

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:03.751
Hit him!

01:05:15.667 --> 01:05:16.542
Buckle up.

01:05:24.417 --> 01:05:25.709
Ziwan is behind us.

01:05:34.001 --> 01:05:35.751
Sir, shall we lower the rolling gate?

01:05:36.834 --> 01:05:38.251
Close it.

01:05:52.417 --> 01:05:53.417
Hang on!

01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:22.501
Take off.

01:06:22.626 --> 01:06:23.834
Take off now.

01:06:42.334 --> 01:06:43.542
How's she doing?

01:07:23.001 --> 01:07:23.834
Ram him!

01:07:37.584 --> 01:07:38.417
You alright?

01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:43.584
Don't get out.

01:08:07.626 --> 01:08:09.167
Stay still.

01:08:10.459 --> 01:08:12.376
Get in, Wolf.

01:08:25.584 --> 01:08:26.417
You ok?

01:08:26.501 --> 01:08:27.292
I'm fine.

01:08:30.917 --> 01:08:32.751
So, have you been charged?

01:08:32.834 --> 01:08:34.542
They accused us of trespassing.

01:08:34.959 --> 01:08:36.292
It's his wife.

01:08:36.334 --> 01:08:37.709
Another one is there for treatment.

01:08:37.751 --> 01:08:39.167
The charge won't stick.

01:08:47.417 --> 01:08:48.917
How you feeling?

01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:52.501
Where's Jia?

01:08:54.667 --> 01:08:57.084
The Ex-Stem Cells injection is completed.

01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:59.251
Close observation is required.

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:02.126
Is Jia alright?

01:09:27.251 --> 01:09:29.292
Go upstairs!

01:09:39.126 --> 01:09:41.459
Phiantrophist Tang was held hostage at gun point.

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:43.251
Police are searching for a fuigitive.

01:09:43.376 --> 01:09:44.834
A male in his mid-thirties.

01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:46.376
With a gunshot wound to the foot.

01:09:46.584 --> 01:09:48.626
Now let's turn to the scene on live.

01:10:06.792 --> 01:10:08.584
What's the point of being alive?

01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:10.501
If a person doesn't move or speak?

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:12.501
Just staring at her phone.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:16.251
Do you prefer some action?

01:10:19.376 --> 01:10:22.292
I don't mean that, don't take me wrong.

01:10:49.251 --> 01:10:51.126
You scared me.

01:10:52.251 --> 01:10:54.667
Come, get in.

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:56.584
No.

01:10:59.417 --> 01:11:00.834
The Cops are after you.

01:11:01.584 --> 01:11:02.751
I know.

01:11:03.584 --> 01:11:06.959
I've got leave now.

01:11:07.959 --> 01:11:09.376
Go in and see Jane first.

01:11:10.209 --> 01:11:12.084
I've seen her from outside.

01:11:14.334 --> 01:11:16.917
Could you pass on a message.

01:11:17.792 --> 01:11:19.209
Tell her.

01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:22.751
To stay in for treatment.

01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:27.709
And ask Ziwan to take good care of her.

01:11:30.084 --> 01:11:31.626
He also said...

01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:33.417
whenever you need him.

01:11:33.626 --> 01:11:35.709
Jia will always by your side.

01:11:41.042 --> 01:11:43.292
He cannot leave.

01:11:51.667 --> 01:11:53.001
Jia.

01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:00.209
Jane.

01:12:00.542 --> 01:12:02.167
Let's go home Jane.

01:12:05.959 --> 01:12:06.584
Becareful.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:10.167
Jia.

01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:15.584
Jia.

01:12:47.042 --> 01:12:48.292
Why are you here?

01:12:50.126 --> 01:12:52.001
Don't forget this is my home too.

01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:01.209
What are they doing here?

01:13:06.834 --> 01:13:08.167
Tie her up.

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:11.667
What the hell are you doing?

01:13:12.417 --> 01:13:13.667
Tang.

01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:20.501
I will do one last favor for you.

01:13:28.126 --> 01:13:29.501
You said.

01:13:29.917 --> 01:13:31.501
Whoever took the notebook...

01:13:31.626 --> 01:13:33.042
is the murderer.

01:13:33.417 --> 01:13:34.876
It belongs to you now.

01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:38.959
People come and go.

01:13:40.126 --> 01:13:42.042
Health doesn't ensure longetivity.

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.626
You may die in a car crash.

01:13:45.084 --> 01:13:47.459
You may die by choking on food.

01:13:49.042 --> 01:13:50.459
Sometimes...

01:13:52.626 --> 01:13:54.876
may die by burning to death.

01:14:00.417 --> 01:14:02.542
Did you really kill our Mentor?

01:14:07.251 --> 01:14:08.751
What the hell, have you gone nuts?

01:14:10.209 --> 01:14:12.167
It's a dead end for us anyway.

01:14:12.292 --> 01:14:14.667
Why don't you go first?

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:18.084
If you're not my friend, then you're enemy.

01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:20.167
Think you can get away with it

01:14:20.251 --> 01:14:21.917
by killing me?

01:14:24.084 --> 01:14:26.751
I will live on and on.

01:14:34.584 --> 01:14:36.626
Tang.

01:14:38.584 --> 01:14:40.292
I'm your wife.

01:14:50.876 --> 01:14:51.751
Let me go.

01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:54.209
Let him witness this.

01:14:56.417 --> 01:14:58.042
Come back...

01:14:59.667 --> 01:15:00.959
Come back...

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:07.042
Hey Tinbo.

01:15:07.667 --> 01:15:08.751
A call for you.

01:15:24.584 --> 01:15:27.209
No... no... no...

01:15:27.501 --> 01:15:28.751
No!

01:15:28.876 --> 01:15:30.501
No!

01:15:56.376 --> 01:15:58.376
I can save a life...

01:15:59.917 --> 01:16:02.084
Yet can't mend a heart.

01:16:04.917 --> 01:16:07.542
My husband is hopeless.

01:16:08.001 --> 01:16:13.042
"If I don't travel to hell, who will?"

01:16:20.459 --> 01:16:22.501
Death is the fairest thing in the world.

01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:25.376
No one's ever gotten out of it.

01:16:25.584 --> 01:16:27.917
Money can't buy Heaven's plan.

01:16:40.292 --> 01:16:43.042
Every day maybe your last.

01:16:45.084 --> 01:16:47.709
It's not that I love to live.

01:16:47.876 --> 01:16:50.417
It's just that I can't leave that person behind.

01:16:53.292 --> 01:16:55.792
I'm not taking my secret to the grave.

01:16:56.042 --> 01:16:58.417
Take me home.

01:17:44.501 --> 01:17:47.876
You've given me the best, don't take it away.

01:18:16.167 --> 01:18:17.459
Here's the Ex-Stem Cells.

01:18:17.501 --> 01:18:19.292
It will help her.

01:18:23.876 --> 01:18:25.584
The family you wanted...

01:18:26.167 --> 01:18:27.876
I present you, Jia.

01:18:36.667 --> 01:18:38.042
Promise to take good care of her.

01:18:38.126 --> 01:18:40.126
Otherwise, i won't forgive you.

01:18:49.917 --> 01:18:51.167
Ziwan.

01:19:23.876 --> 01:19:24.834
Look at this...

01:19:25.126 --> 01:19:26.959
With a single pill like painkiller.

01:19:27.001 --> 01:19:28.209
Remedy to cure all illness.

01:19:28.251 --> 01:19:31.751
If it cures cancer that easily,
is it profitable?

01:19:32.959 --> 01:19:36.167
I'd make it more complicated to get.

01:19:39.751 --> 01:19:41.542
Sir, do you have a permit?

01:19:42.084 --> 01:19:43.501
Here.

01:19:51.001 --> 01:19:52.334
All the way down the hall.

01:19:52.501 --> 01:19:53.417
Then turn right.

01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:54.959
Yu's office is right here.

01:19:55.876 --> 01:19:57.459
Where is the Security Control Center?

01:19:58.001 --> 01:19:59.084
Who you teaming up with?

01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.792
With him.

01:20:00.126 --> 01:20:01.084
Why ask then?

01:20:01.542 --> 01:20:02.917
Just tag along, ok?

01:20:04.459 --> 01:20:06.167
Once we gather all the data of Ex-Stem Cells.

01:20:06.292 --> 01:20:07.876
Meet up by the fridge truck.

01:20:08.126 --> 01:20:09.001
It's justice time for

01:20:09.001 --> 01:20:10.834
those burnt to death 5 years ago.

01:20:11.167 --> 01:20:12.209
Are you ready?

01:20:12.292 --> 01:20:13.126
Yes.

01:20:15.459 --> 01:20:18.209
Be cooperative, Mr. Chief Security Officer!

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:24.042
The pest control is here.

01:20:24.167 --> 01:20:24.917
Copy that.

01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:41.501
Do you feel your heart beating faster?

01:20:43.084 --> 01:20:45.584
Without the anittode in 30 mins,

01:20:45.792 --> 01:20:48.084
your heart will explode.

01:20:54.459 --> 01:20:56.126
Exterminators for clinic level.

01:21:48.626 --> 01:21:49.542
Freeze.

01:21:52.959 --> 01:21:54.542
Not a single move.

01:21:57.417 --> 01:21:59.042
Do not shoot!

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:03.626
Excuse me...

01:22:07.584 --> 01:22:08.667
Everyone into the restroom.

01:22:08.751 --> 01:22:09.417
Now!

01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:11.376
All to the restroom.

01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:27.751
Everyone! Hurry up!

01:22:36.459 --> 01:22:37.917
Headquarter, do you copy?

01:22:38.751 --> 01:22:40.209
Do you copy?

01:22:41.001 --> 01:22:42.459
Faster.

01:22:43.251 --> 01:22:44.334
Calling station.

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:46.417
Can you hear me...?

01:22:46.584 --> 01:22:48.042
Can you hear me?

01:22:49.126 --> 01:22:51.501
Please response.

01:22:52.209 --> 01:22:53.417
Headquarter, reponse please.

01:22:53.542 --> 01:22:54.834
I wonder if they heard us.

01:22:55.376 --> 01:22:56.917
Do you copy? The walkies are out.

01:22:57.126 --> 01:22:58.209
Our walkies are dead.

01:22:58.334 --> 01:22:59.376
Dispatch.

01:23:03.042 --> 01:23:04.001
To Control room.

01:23:04.126 --> 01:23:06.042
This is the Entrance kisok.

01:23:06.167 --> 01:23:07.959
The walkies are not working.

01:23:09.501 --> 01:23:10.959
Control room...

01:23:11.042 --> 01:23:11.834
We're looking into it.

01:23:11.959 --> 01:23:13.626
Remain in position.

01:23:14.334 --> 01:23:15.626
Thanks.

01:23:30.251 --> 01:23:32.209
Mr. Tang, your cell has been ringing.

01:23:36.792 --> 01:23:39.042
"Being Hacked."

01:23:48.626 --> 01:23:50.167
"Being Hacked."

01:23:57.334 --> 01:23:58.167
Security?

01:23:58.709 --> 01:24:00.459
David, where're you?

01:24:00.751 --> 01:24:02.167
Can anyone hear me in Security headquarter?

01:24:02.334 --> 01:24:03.167
Hey Chief.

01:24:03.292 --> 01:24:05.167
It's your boss.

01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:06.501
David?

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:08.209
Choose your words carefully.

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:10.084
Respond to me, David.

01:24:11.459 --> 01:24:13.667
Mr. Tang, this is David.

01:24:13.834 --> 01:24:15.876
There are theieves in Yu's office, send your men.

01:24:16.167 --> 01:24:17.126
Right now!

01:24:18.626 --> 01:24:19.501
Copy that.

01:24:24.501 --> 01:24:26.542
Go check over there.

01:24:40.167 --> 01:24:41.292
What are you doing here?

01:24:41.334 --> 01:24:42.709
Headquarter, do you copy?

01:24:42.834 --> 01:24:44.626
There's a break in at Clinic Level.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:49.667
You have 16 mins.

01:24:49.959 --> 01:24:51.084
Behave...

01:24:57.126 --> 01:24:58.751
Been waiting for this moment for ages.

01:25:00.959 --> 01:25:01.876
You bastard.

01:25:15.542 --> 01:25:17.501
Wolf, it's Poon Ziwan.

01:25:18.876 --> 01:25:20.084
Run.

01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:36.917
Go to Yu's office.

01:25:50.542 --> 01:25:52.042
There you are, fatso.

01:25:53.959 --> 01:25:55.376
Come out.

01:26:05.876 --> 01:26:08.042
David, why is it taking so long?

01:26:08.376 --> 01:26:09.042
David.

01:26:09.167 --> 01:26:12.042
- Help...
- Scumbag.

01:26:17.459 --> 01:26:18.834
I said get out.

01:26:20.042 --> 01:26:21.417
Come, let's fight.

01:26:28.084 --> 01:26:29.292
Where's he?

01:27:26.751 --> 01:27:27.959
Poon Ziwan.

01:27:28.959 --> 01:27:30.584
Finally, we meet.

01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:07.001
Drop the gun.

01:28:15.209 --> 01:28:16.167
Are you ok, Will?

01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:48.542
Let's run.

01:28:50.834 --> 01:28:51.542
Hurry!

01:28:55.209 --> 01:28:56.209
Get up now.

01:28:56.376 --> 01:28:57.334
Run.

01:28:58.167 --> 01:28:59.667
Where is Cousin?

01:29:04.792 --> 01:29:06.626
- Hows it?
- Don't worry... don't worry...

01:29:28.042 --> 01:29:30.876
Tinbo, antitode please?

01:29:36.501 --> 01:29:38.292
Attention everyone.

01:29:38.459 --> 01:29:40.751
Due to unexpected circumstances.

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:42.626
We ask that you stay calm.

01:29:42.751 --> 01:29:45.459
Come help me with this.

01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:48.417
Emergency evecuation lifts

01:29:48.417 --> 01:29:49.751
are available.

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:50.876
What's happening?

01:29:50.959 --> 01:29:52.584
Nothing... this is Sky One.

01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:54.584
Everything is under control.

01:29:58.876 --> 01:30:00.792
Run! Hurry up!

01:30:00.834 --> 01:30:02.084
Run now...

01:30:04.001 --> 01:30:05.667
Faster...

01:30:07.084 --> 01:30:08.542
Keep running...

01:30:11.001 --> 01:30:11.834
Keep going...

01:30:11.959 --> 01:30:13.667
Take him with you.

01:30:15.292 --> 01:30:17.334
Antitode... Give me the antitode please...

01:30:17.417 --> 01:30:20.292
Glucose won't kill you, chief.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:23.251
Run...

01:30:33.876 --> 01:30:36.584
Ziwan is waiting, leave first.

01:30:36.751 --> 01:30:38.126
How'bout you?

01:30:40.584 --> 01:30:42.001
Go now.

01:31:15.834 --> 01:31:17.042
This way.

01:31:23.584 --> 01:31:24.459
Where's Tinbo?

01:31:24.542 --> 01:31:25.584
He's not leaving.

01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:27.542
Where's he?

01:31:36.876 --> 01:31:37.542
Hello.

01:31:38.251 --> 01:31:39.126
We're waiting for you.

01:31:41.042 --> 01:31:43.292
Just go, don't wait.

01:31:44.751 --> 01:31:46.126
What the heck?

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:47.626
Why are you staying?

01:31:48.834 --> 01:31:50.084
Later.

01:31:50.417 --> 01:31:51.751
You hiding something from us?

01:31:53.542 --> 01:31:56.501
You must continue the dying wishes
of your dad and Yu.

01:31:56.792 --> 01:31:58.584
Do not let them down.

01:31:59.584 --> 01:32:01.001
Don't hang up.

01:32:29.292 --> 01:32:30.334
I trusted you.

01:32:31.251 --> 01:32:32.834
I believe that Ex-Stem Cells

01:32:32.834 --> 01:32:34.959
will relieve the pain of mortals.

01:32:38.084 --> 01:32:39.751
Do you know the pain now?

01:32:41.167 --> 01:32:42.876
You used Ex-Stem Cells to kill.

01:32:44.042 --> 01:32:45.667
And you've killed my faith.

01:32:46.834 --> 01:32:48.042
Do you have faith?

01:32:48.084 --> 01:32:50.251
Don't kill me, I don't want to die.

01:32:50.376 --> 01:32:51.584
Pardon me?

01:32:51.834 --> 01:32:52.667
Say it again.

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:54.709
I don't want to die.

01:32:55.042 --> 01:32:57.042
You finally speak like a human being.

01:32:57.126 --> 01:32:59.626
But these words aren't exclusively for you.

01:33:20.917 --> 01:33:22.542
Come back.

01:33:22.751 --> 01:33:24.417
I will haunt you for good...

01:33:25.084 --> 01:33:27.084
you're going to regret it.

01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:36.084
Freeze! Drop the weapon!

01:33:53.417 --> 01:33:54.834
Don't you dare to turn it off.

01:33:55.251 --> 01:33:56.584
Keep watching.

01:34:04.042 --> 01:34:06.042
Mr. Tang, let's go.

01:34:12.376 --> 01:34:13.959
Yu was always right.

01:34:15.042 --> 01:34:16.501
You're hopeless.

01:34:47.084 --> 01:34:48.251
Go after him.

01:34:55.876 --> 01:34:57.292
He has no way out.

01:35:02.542 --> 01:35:03.709
Freeze.

01:35:14.876 --> 01:35:15.917
Do you copy?

01:35:16.126 --> 01:35:18.084
Do you hear me...

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.251
he's a real badass.

01:35:32.042 --> 01:35:33.167
Do you copy?

01:35:33.417 --> 01:35:34.917
Calling Headquarter.

01:36:13.459 --> 01:36:16.209
I can't see anything.

01:37:16.042 --> 01:37:18.084
What is the play about?

01:37:19.084 --> 01:37:21.834
There was a flood and humankind was in danger.

01:37:21.959 --> 01:37:23.917
Goddess Nüwa used a rock
to mend a hole in the sky.

01:37:24.001 --> 01:37:25.376
Stopped the disaster and saved mankind.

01:37:25.459 --> 01:37:27.001
Thus ruling life, death, growing old and sick.

01:37:27.084 --> 01:37:28.709
And she taught humans to marry and give birth.

01:37:28.792 --> 01:37:30.834
Generation to generation.

01:37:31.126 --> 01:37:33.292
Death is Heavens plan.

01:37:33.459 --> 01:37:36.251
Why mend the sky? Just let human live forever.
