I just, yeah.
I just got emotional.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.827

05:49.871 --> 05:53.309
And listen, I guess if you're
lonely and sad about your life,

05:53.353 --> 05:56.486
then sometimes you take it out
on the people closest to you.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.401

05:58.445 --> 05:59.663

06:07.105 --> 06:08.629
- How far is it from here?
- Yeah.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.065
- It's probably about
a 10-15-minute drive.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.414
- Okay, so we're gonna have,
I think, paddleboards

06:11.458 --> 06:12.981

Yes.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.548
We have paddleboards and some
activities and everything.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.245
It's really lovely.
I've got an itinerary for you.

06:16.288 --> 06:17.942

your camera, and you're gonna

06:17.986 --> 06:19.422
take photographs of everyone,
right?

06:19.466 --> 06:21.424
- Yeah.
I'm sort of excited about that.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.208
- Tonight we have John's party.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.819

<i>- I can't wait to see you.</i>

06:33.175 --> 06:34.872
<i>I don't know where I'm going,
but I guess I'll find out.</i>

06:34.916 --> 06:38.223
- We have the agency here
in Turks and Caicos,

06:38.267 --> 06:41.270
<i>so my husband
had to go visit their office,</i>

06:41.313 --> 06:43.838
and he just conveniently
timed it for when I happened

06:43.881 --> 06:46.493
to be in Turks and Caicos.
He misses me.

06:46.536 --> 06:47.755
I will text you.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.757
We're going
to Ramona's friend's house.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.933
And if you have a white shirt,

06:51.976 --> 06:53.543
I think they kind of
want us to wear white.

06:53.587 --> 06:54.718
But if I don't like
my white outfit,

06:54.762 --> 06:56.241
if it doesn't fit right,

06:56.285 --> 06:58.200
I'm gonna have to
break the rules.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.420
And Ramona breaks all the
rules, so she'll have to deal.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.946
- Good morning, everyone.
How are you?

07:04.989 --> 07:06.774
- Good morning.
Good. How are you?

07:06.817 --> 07:09.603
- I am feeling great.
Had a good night's sleep.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.082
And that's a frittata?

07:11.126 --> 07:13.737
Smells delicious.
What kind of frittata is it?

07:13.781 --> 07:17.611
- Asparagus and mushroom.
- Yum! Looks great.

07:19.656 --> 07:22.093
Good morning.

07:22.137 --> 07:23.486
How are you?

07:23.530 --> 07:24.792
- What do you want, Ramona?

07:24.835 --> 07:27.577
- It's a new day.
New day, new start.

07:30.319 --> 07:31.799
Have frittatas ready,

07:31.842 --> 07:34.454
and, um,

07:34.497 --> 07:37.718
I'm sorry
that I made your makeup late.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.197
That wasn't my intention.

07:39.241 --> 07:43.201
I like Cynthia, and I can tell
she was genuinely upset,

07:43.245 --> 07:45.377
so even though I don't think
I did anything wrong,

07:45.421 --> 07:47.075
<i>and because I care
about her as a friend,</i>

07:47.118 --> 07:49.947
I have to apologize
for making her upset.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.474
I'm sorry that it was
delayed for you.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.127
I really am.

07:56.171 --> 07:59.174
- I know I was upset
about it last night.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.132
And I'm just, like--
I feel like, you know,

08:01.176 --> 08:03.134
we just keep going
back and forth.

08:03.178 --> 08:06.616
I was just tired, and that
just kind of set me off,

08:06.660 --> 08:08.400
and you know, the lady was--

08:08.444 --> 08:10.881
like, the interview just--
it just--and then I was late.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.144
You know, I have a thing
about respect and being late.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.406
- No, I know. You're on time.
I'm, like, on time too.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.799
- It just threw me off, and--
- I get it.

08:15.843 --> 08:16.757
I mean, I didn't even
get my hair done,

08:16.800 --> 08:18.106
because I didn't
want to be late,

08:18.149 --> 08:19.324
and you know,
you had the appointment,

08:19.368 --> 08:21.544
and I delayed it even further.

08:21.588 --> 08:22.937
- I'm tired
of the bad behavior,

08:22.980 --> 08:24.721
and I'm not gonna let her
get away with it anymore.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.331
I am not gonna let that B--

08:26.375 --> 08:28.377
- Because if you're saying--
if you're vouching for someone

08:28.420 --> 08:29.813
being a good person--
- Right.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.162
- But then where's
the good person?

08:31.206 --> 08:32.512
- I know.

08:32.555 --> 08:33.643
- I'm trying to find it.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.253
I prayed about it.

08:35.297 --> 08:38.648
I just feel reset and rebooted,
and I don't want to,

08:38.692 --> 08:40.737
you know, just keep going
back and forth with you.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.609
I appreciate you.
- I appreciate that.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.306
- But I genuinely do
like you, Ramona.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.526
- Today's a new day. Restart.
I appreciate that.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.831
- All right. Give me a hug.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.006
I'm really trying to...
- Okay. I--

08:49.050 --> 08:50.530
- Come with some
different energy today.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.053
- Okay.
I want only positive energy.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.271
We'll have a fun day
at the beach.

08:53.315 --> 08:56.144
- Yeah.
- Morning. Good--I love this.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.885
- Oh, you look so cute.
- Sorry.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.539
I just want to tell her
I like my outfit.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.018
- Yeah, it looks good.
- You look great.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.672
- What are you guys
talking about?

09:02.716 --> 09:04.065
- I was telling Teresa,
I'm kind of used

09:04.108 --> 09:05.675
to the bad behavior.
I--you know?

09:05.719 --> 09:06.720
- I felt bad
that she left last night.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.373
- I know.
- On herself because--

09:08.417 --> 09:09.723
- Hey, ladies,
I have to make a phone call.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.116
- Problem with Ramona is,
it's really sad to watch

09:12.160 --> 09:15.293
because she is
obviously very unhappy.

09:15.337 --> 09:16.425
- She is.
- And sad.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.600
- I feel for her in that way,
I do.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.558
- I feel for her too.
- She's lonely.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.168
- I'm sympathetic. Lonely?

09:20.211 --> 09:21.517
- Do you know what she said
to me that made me almost cry?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.736
- She's sad.
What?

09:22.779 --> 09:24.041
- She said,
"Yeah I'm gonna stay

09:24.085 --> 09:25.739
a couple more days
in Turks and Caicos.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.175
You know, I have
my girlfriend coming,"

09:27.218 --> 09:29.438
and I said, "Yeah?
You want to stay longer?"

09:29.481 --> 09:31.701
She goes,
"What am I going home to?

09:31.745 --> 09:33.007
Nothing."
- She has nothing.

09:33.050 --> 09:36.619
- And I was like, my heart--
like, I don't--

09:36.663 --> 09:37.968
- You're heartsick.
- You know?

09:38.012 --> 09:39.361
It's true, you're going home
to an empty house.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.450
- And what she said yesterday
is like, you know,

09:41.493 --> 09:43.539
"Why does she always like you?"

09:43.583 --> 09:45.062
It was sad to me.
- Yeah.

09:45.106 --> 09:48.022
- It was like reaching out
for help almost, you know?

09:48.065 --> 09:50.415
- It is.
- And I feel bad.

09:50.459 --> 09:53.157
- I'm not giving her an excuse
at all, but it is sad.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.899
- I just really had
to sleep on it, you know?

09:55.943 --> 09:59.990
I've grown, and I just wish
the same for her.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.906
It's taken, you know, this trip
and all of you girls to, like,

10:02.950 --> 10:05.909
make me see
that her bad behavior

10:05.953 --> 10:09.086
is not acceptable, you know?

10:09.130 --> 10:12.089
And that's my bad that I put up
with it all this time.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.049
Like, that's not gonna
happen anymore.

10:15.092 --> 10:18.443
That's done, okay? I'm done.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.478
Yeah. Hold on one second.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.699
- I don't think
she wants to be

right there right now.
- Oh, I don't care.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.485
- Who wants to go in the back?

11:00.529 --> 11:01.704
Oh,
How are we gonna do that?

11:01.748 --> 11:03.140

This is--I thought this was
the three-seater one,

11:04.489 --> 11:05.665
and there was
a four-seater one?

11:09.799 --> 11:11.279
- How about if I go
in the back with Ramona?

11:11.322 --> 11:13.716
- What about my seat?
- I don't care.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.153

Six figures.

The minute I up my price,

12:02.939 --> 12:04.593
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying,
you know, it's very--

12:04.636 --> 12:07.857
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.904
- I took an allergy pill,
and now I can't open my eyes.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.862
- No. It said non-drowsy.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.864
- I'm taking a little nap
just while we drive there.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.127
- All right. Go ahead.
- We all hit a wall.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.173
- I think we're all over-tired.
Even I'm getting tired.

12:19.216 --> 12:22.132
- And I haven't had a chance
to kind of reboot and reset.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.917
Kyle, I'm actually glad
you ended up in the car

12:23.960 --> 12:26.006
because I just wanted
to share with you

12:26.049 --> 12:29.444
that last night
when I left the dinner,

12:29.487 --> 12:31.402
I just felt like my energy
just was off.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.404
And I don't know
if I'm just exhausted,

12:33.448 --> 12:34.579
but I was like,
"What is wrong with me?"

12:34.623 --> 12:37.104
Like, I'm acting like
a crazy person.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.410
How do I keep being
in this little funk with Kyle?

12:39.454 --> 12:40.890
<i>Who is the prettiest?</i>

12:40.934 --> 12:43.284
- Oh, this feels weird.
- You can say, "You know what?

12:43.327 --> 12:44.807
"I pick Cynthia because...

12:44.851 --> 12:46.069
- I would never say that,
though.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.679
- "Not only is she beautiful
on the outside,

12:47.723 --> 12:48.811
she's beautiful on the inside."

12:48.855 --> 12:51.509
- I don't know.
I couldn't do that.

12:51.553 --> 12:52.815
<i>- Don't blame me,
you being late.</i>

12:52.859 --> 12:54.338
That's wrong. Sorry.
- No, no, no. No.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.600
You are the reason
why I'm late.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.124
- Guys, will all due respect,
like,

12:57.167 --> 12:59.561
you know, we can say it
because she took five minutes,

12:59.604 --> 13:00.997
but, like,
you went without lashes.

13:01.041 --> 13:05.219
It's not like, you know--
it can't be only about that.

13:05.262 --> 13:08.004
- And then when I woke up
this morning I just prayed,

13:08.048 --> 13:09.832
and I was like--I think,

13:09.876 --> 13:12.617
and I'm so mortified
to say this, but--

13:12.661 --> 13:14.358
- What? Now you woke me up.
This is getting interesting.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.099
- I know.

13:16.143 --> 13:22.366
I'm a little jealous that you
and Kenya have hit it off.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.412
I came here with her
being my friend,

13:24.455 --> 13:27.284
and you guys have hit it off,
and it's so great to watch.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.069
But then it just, like,

13:29.112 --> 13:31.245
started to make me
a little jealous, and I--

13:31.288 --> 13:32.550
- Aw...
- I hate to admit that.

13:32.594 --> 13:35.902
But I love you, I receive you,

13:35.945 --> 13:39.340
and I would like to just
reset the button and restart.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.820
I really want
to leave this island...

13:40.863 --> 13:43.648
- Reset.
- On a good note with you.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.128
- It does take a lot to admit.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.261
You know, I think I felt,
you know, jealous, whatever,

13:47.304 --> 13:48.305
So I thank you.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.351
I appreciate Cynthia's apology,

13:50.394 --> 13:52.744
and I'm more than happy
to move on.

13:52.788 --> 13:55.008
Do I think that Cynthia and I
are gonna be great friends?

13:55.051 --> 13:59.229
Probably not.
She's just not that fun.

13:59.273 --> 14:03.059
- Kenya, when it was
volleyball day, said to me,

14:03.103 --> 14:06.106
"Cynthia's a little,
like, mad or jealous

14:06.149 --> 14:08.848
that you and I are friends."

14:08.891 --> 14:11.807
- She feels like you and I
are super cliquey.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.113
- Really?

14:13.156 --> 14:14.679
- She said it to me
when we were on the boat.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.117
- No, she did not!
- Yes, she did.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.075
- She said that, and I just
never said it to you,

14:19.119 --> 14:20.381
but that's not the case
actually, right?

14:20.424 --> 14:21.643
- Well,
that's actually not true.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.036
In your case...
- Okay, yeah.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.254
- To be honest with you,

14:24.298 --> 14:26.561
I really hadn't really
thought about you.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.519
- I was wondering about--
- If it was bothering you.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.217
- I was the one
that was pushing--

14:30.260 --> 14:32.872
- Maybe she makes it up,
'cause she said that to me.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.525
- Now, that's some
bull-[bleep],

14:34.569 --> 14:36.701
<i>and I'm hurt that Kenya</i>

14:36.745 --> 14:39.008
would make that up
and tell that to Melissa.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.924
I've just never had to fight
for Kenya's attention before.

14:41.968 --> 14:42.925
- Got it.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.100
- Because
in our group of girls,

14:44.144 --> 14:45.667
like, she doesn't
have that many friends.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.712
Stuff like this
is why Kenya and I

14:47.756 --> 14:49.192
are in the situation
we're in now.

14:49.236 --> 14:50.802
I will say, on this trip,

14:50.846 --> 14:52.848
I have not really hung out

14:52.892 --> 14:54.545
with you or spent any time
with you.

14:54.589 --> 14:55.720
With everybody else, like,
I feel like

14:55.764 --> 14:57.418
I've kind of gotten to know,

14:57.461 --> 14:58.985
but I haven't really had, like,
any one-on-one time with you.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.203
- Yeah. I know.
- It just hasn't happened.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.378
- And you know what, Cynthia?

15:01.422 --> 15:02.989
Maybe I stayed away
a little bit, too,

15:03.032 --> 15:06.035
because once Kenya said
that to me, I was like,

15:06.079 --> 15:08.908
"I don't want to, like,
get in there too much."

15:08.951 --> 15:10.126
I feel like I'm not doing
that purposely though.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.519
- Yeah.
- So that makes me feel bad,

15:11.562 --> 15:13.042
'cause I really feel like...

15:13.086 --> 15:14.826
- No. That's okay.
- I knew you well coming into--

15:14.870 --> 15:16.654
- I mean, I don't honestly know
why she said that.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.526
- No, I mean feel bad that
you're saying

15:18.569 --> 15:20.223
we haven't spent time together.
I want to spend time together.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.746
- Yeah, and I mean, I know.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.009
- All right, well then,
let's make an effort to spend

15:23.052 --> 15:24.793
a little time together
today and tomorrow.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.751
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't
want to force anything...

15:28.275 --> 15:29.580
- Okay.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.365
- I don't think
Melissa and Cynthia

15:31.408 --> 15:32.496
are gonna be friends
in two days.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.150
I think that
friend ship has sailed.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.020
- Yeah, well, I've been wanting
to talk to you too.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.717
- I was sick this morning, so I
would have come to your room.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.197
- Well, we'll talk.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.590
- Welcome, welcome.
- Hello, Michael.

16:22.633 --> 16:25.288
- How you doing?
- Oh, these are so pretty.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.856
- Oh, my God,
with our names on it.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.075
- Isn't this cute?
- Oh, no.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.077
We all need to hold it
like our peach.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.426
- This is it right here, the--

16:32.469 --> 16:34.036
- She's not here yet.
- Exactly, that's a shot.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.907
- Michael can take the photos.
- Yes!

16:35.951 --> 16:37.126
- Okay. Are you ladies ready?

16:37.170 --> 16:38.258
- Make sure your names
are showing.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.302
- So on "three, I want everyone

16:39.346 --> 16:41.043
to just
put the coconuts forward.

16:41.087 --> 16:44.960
One, two, three.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.353
Oh, my God. Amazing.
That's lovely.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.745
Let's just start right there.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.965
Oh, my God. You are a pro.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.576
Okay, Miss Luann,
what have you got?

16:52.620 --> 16:56.885
Oh, look out!
Oh, my goodness. Hold on.

16:56.928 --> 17:00.976
Stay down. That's really sexy.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.369
Pop your bum out, a little bit.

17:02.412 --> 17:05.850
- To get a good Insta photo,
keep your chin down,

17:05.894 --> 17:07.852
and that makes your eyes open.

17:07.896 --> 17:11.117
- Like, give me, like, a smile.
Like, a really happy smile.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.901
Maybe not with, like,
your legs open, but yeah.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.772
That's a little nicer.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.339
That is beautiful, so just--

17:16.383 --> 17:19.386
- Stick your chest out,
but suck your stomach in,

17:19.429 --> 17:22.128
and of course, you have
to give them that curve

17:22.171 --> 17:24.608
that everyone likes to see.

17:24.652 --> 17:27.046
- I like the mystique.
I like--yeah.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.482
That just looks expensive.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.484
Yeah, lie down, that's nice.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.487
Can you maybe put one leg up,
a little bit?

17:33.530 --> 17:35.010
Try the other one.
Try the other leg.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.185
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.405
- <i>
- Yes, arm up. I love that.</i>

17:40.624 --> 17:41.538
- Oh, Lord.

17:41.582 --> 17:44.193
Lordy, Lordy, this lady.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.152
- Ugh, I'm not in the mood
to take photos.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.196
- Tilt your head up
a little bit for me.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.590
- Ramona is.

17:49.633 --> 17:50.765
<i>I'm just being honest here.</i>

17:50.808 --> 17:52.723
My bathing suit
is ruining my vibe.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.377
<i>It only looks cute
with my dress,</i>

17:54.421 --> 17:56.988
and with everything else off,
it's not.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.555
I'm not feeling myself today.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.557
<i>I'm not posing
in a bathing suit.</i>

18:00.601 --> 18:03.560
<i>What is this?
"Sports Illustrated"?</i>

18:03.604 --> 18:04.692
I don't think so.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.215
- What is that?
- Oh, my God.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.652
See, like,
I'm--I can't breathe.

18:08.696 --> 18:09.610
- All right. I'll go.
- I will.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.438
- No, Lu's going.
- I'll go.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.657
- All right,
so what's the point of this?

18:13.701 --> 18:15.790
Do I want to roll
across the water?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.879
- No problem.
- No problem.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.492
Can I get a blowout
while I'm in here?

18:22.536 --> 18:23.711
- Maybe.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.060
- You're gonna get
a blowout, all right.

18:27.497 --> 18:30.283
Look--look at her.
It's your Beyoncé moment.

18:30.326 --> 18:34.156
Yes. Bring it.
- Oh, my God.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.593
-
This is so weird!

18:36.637 --> 18:38.291
- Oh, yes.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.207
- She knows how to work a ball.
You know what I mean, ladies?

18:41.250 --> 18:44.775
Yes! Now, hamster it for me.
Hamster it.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.995
- Look at that sexy hamster.
- Show me gerbil.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.606
Show me gerbil.
- Oh, sh--

18:49.650 --> 18:51.478
- Oh! Hold her.
- Oh, she's doing good.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.088
- Oh, that's good.
- Wait. Luann.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.394
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.178
- Wait. Wait.
- I have a mic, I have a mic.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.745
- the hell?

18:57.788 --> 19:01.836
What'd I just step on?
- This is amazing! I love it.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.359
I do love a good roll
in the hay,

19:03.403 --> 19:05.144
so why not a hamster wheel?

19:07.058 --> 19:09.583
- Yes, yes!
- Oh!

19:09.626 --> 19:11.237
- Oh, hold it. Oh, my God.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.065
- Yes! That's how you do it.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.676
-
Oh, God. Wow.

19:18.722 --> 19:22.073
- I may go paddleboarding.
- Okay.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.119
- Want to get a drink?
- I do want to get a drink.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.251
What should we get?

19:25.294 --> 19:26.339
- I want you to take your
glasses off.

19:26.382 --> 19:27.514
- Take them off?

19:27.557 --> 19:28.732
- Yeah, 'cause I like
your face.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.038
- I have no, like,
real makeup on today.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.518
- No, but you don't need it.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.172
- Can we have tequila
on the rocks?

19:33.215 --> 19:34.956
- Sure.
- That's the one.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.263
- Oh, yes.
-

19:37.306 --> 19:39.221
- That one, to me,
is really pretty.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.614
- Au revoir!
- Au revoir.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.659
- One, two, three.

19:42.703 --> 19:46.576
Right there. Beautiful.
You good?

19:46.620 --> 19:48.665
- Yeah, I'm good, I have to
have the talk with Ramona, so--

19:48.709 --> 19:50.667
- Yeah, and for me,
that was just, like, a reset.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.930
I'm gonna enjoy
the rest of my trip.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.019
And I'm not gonna get...
- I mean, it's your right.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.325
- Taken out of my energy.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.284
Like, last night,
I completely just checked out.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.894
- Yeah.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.635
Now I'm just trying to figure
out, what is wrong with me?

20:01.678 --> 20:03.419
Like, what has happened to me?

20:03.463 --> 20:07.684
Like, why am I so upset?

20:07.728 --> 20:10.818
And the only thing
I can think of

20:10.861 --> 20:14.778
is I'm in a very weird space
with Kenya right now.

20:14.822 --> 20:18.826
<i>She has done a lot of things
that really hurt me.</i>

20:18.869 --> 20:21.263
- I don't want to diss
her game, but sexiest?

20:21.307 --> 20:23.570
- It's marginalizing us.
- Yes, but--

20:23.613 --> 20:27.530
- I just wanted to say,
last night, for my Bailey Q...

20:29.837 --> 20:31.099
What are you doing?

20:31.142 --> 20:32.927
- Oh, just rinsing my feet off.

20:32.970 --> 20:36.365
- Hi. Can I come in?
What's wrong?

20:38.802 --> 20:40.195
Shut the door.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.632
Will you shut the--I don't--
just I don't want to--

20:45.156 --> 20:46.810
- Oh, rum punch.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.377
- Well, that's exactly what I
would like to order, as well.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.858
- You had the rum punch?
- Rum punch. Yes, please.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.381
<i>- We are at the end
of the trip.</i>

20:52.425 --> 20:53.382
Like, one day left.

20:53.426 --> 20:54.514
<i>I'm not really sure</i>

20:54.557 --> 20:56.342
where our friendship stands,

20:56.385 --> 21:01.085
and I'm afraid because I don't
think it will ever be the same.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.400

21:11.444 --> 21:13.402

21:13.446 --> 21:16.579
- Beautiful. That's amazing.
Yes.

21:16.623 --> 21:17.928
- Oh, my God!

21:17.972 --> 21:19.974
- Ah!
- Get out of my way!

21:20.017 --> 21:23.586
- Oh,
- Oh, that's a drink holder.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.066
- Michael!

21:26.372 --> 21:27.155
- Ay-yi-yi.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.113
- Mikel.
- Hold on.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.420
- The wind is very strong
to come back.

21:31.464 --> 21:33.030
- Look at Ramona.
I think she's stuck.

21:35.642 --> 21:36.947
- Oh, my God.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.993
I am literally only in water
up to my knees.

21:39.036 --> 21:41.038
- I told you! I don't know
why you wore that thing.

21:41.082 --> 21:44.041
- Seriously.
I look like a fool.

21:44.085 --> 21:46.305
Michael, there's only
two feet of water!

21:46.348 --> 21:48.219
- I can't do anything
about the depth in the ocean.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.744
- Seriously?
- I'm dead.

21:50.787 --> 21:52.485
- Ridiculous.

21:52.528 --> 21:53.964
- Michael!
- Yes?

21:54.008 --> 21:56.184
- When you're done with
Cynthia, I took my vest off

21:56.227 --> 21:59.796
so I can get a better picture
on the paddleboard.

21:59.840 --> 22:00.884
- Okay.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.368

22:06.412 --> 22:09.850

22:13.680 --> 22:15.812

22:15.856 --> 22:16.726
Look at what
they're doing to her!

22:16.770 --> 22:18.162
What did they do to her?

22:18.206 --> 22:20.556
Meliss, they knocked into her.
That's mean.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.385
- Oh, no, they did not.

22:23.429 --> 22:26.823
I don't think Ramona has ever
dealt with anyone

22:26.867 --> 22:28.216
<i>like Kenya before.</i>

22:28.259 --> 22:30.523
Poor Ramona. Now I feel bad.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.004
- So ladies, you have
a look at the menu.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.658
When you know
what you want to order,

22:35.702 --> 22:37.268
we'll have one of the servers
come over and take that order.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.096
We're gonna sort of do
a bit of a tapas-style...

22:39.140 --> 22:40.620
- Okay.
- Dining.

22:40.663 --> 22:43.927
- Thank you so much.
- Hey, Ramona, come.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.668
Let's go in here. It's too hot.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.553
- Okay.

23:00.596 --> 23:03.120
You know, every day, I say,

23:03.164 --> 23:05.775
"God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things

23:05.819 --> 23:07.690
"I cannot change, the courage
to change the things I can...

23:07.734 --> 23:08.996
- Mm-hmm.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.867
- And the wisdom
to know the difference."

23:10.911 --> 23:12.478
I know I can't change you.

23:12.521 --> 23:17.047
And the apologies are just the
same they've been for years.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.528
- So Bethenny, I guess
I came across rude.

23:19.572 --> 23:22.401
I just was hot
and bothered and hungry.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.880
I'm sorry,
so I'ma toast with water.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.316
- All right.
- What about me?

23:25.360 --> 23:26.709
- Oh, you don't count.
Bethenny counts right now.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.058
- Oh, right.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.495
- Carol, I'm sorry
that you were offended.

23:29.538 --> 23:32.411
You know, you're
some 28-year-old.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.151
- This is your apology, Ramona?
- No.

23:34.195 --> 23:35.414
Luann, I wasn't even invited
to the wedding,

23:35.457 --> 23:37.807
so let's call a spade a spade.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.548
- I knew it.
I knew what I heard.

23:39.592 --> 23:40.854
That she calls Tom...
- You know what?

23:40.897 --> 23:41.855
- To get invited.
Then it was like--

23:41.898 --> 23:43.291
- I texted you.
- You know what?

23:43.334 --> 23:44.901
You didn't invite me
to the wedding, so--

23:44.945 --> 23:46.686
- You knew it was a bad call.
You knew it was a bad call.

23:46.729 --> 23:49.297
- And I am so sorry...

23:49.340 --> 23:51.560
- Yeah. It was a bad call.
- Yeah, but--

23:51.604 --> 23:53.867
- What you did yesterday was
just continued bad behavior,

23:53.910 --> 23:56.347
and I feel like
I'm there for you, as a friend,

23:56.391 --> 23:57.914
and I always have been.
I don't--

23:57.958 --> 24:01.483
I don't remember any--ever
doing anything bad towards you

24:01.527 --> 24:04.921
that would have you behave
the way you have towards me.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.532
You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I'm listening to you.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.229
- What is that there?
Yummy bread?

24:08.272 --> 24:09.926
- This is called bread
and butter.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.364
- Kyle, I know
you don't know about this.

24:13.408 --> 24:15.192
It is the fruit of the Earth.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.193
-
Oh, you know, we don't

24:16.237 --> 24:17.760
have that in Beverly Hills.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.109
We don't eat bread and butter.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.156
- Through all the women,
I've realized

24:22.199 --> 24:24.637
this bad behavior is
not acceptable.

24:24.680 --> 24:28.162
I've given you a pass
for so many years,

24:28.205 --> 24:30.207
but I'm not gonna
do it anymore.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.558
I can't continue a friendship

24:32.601 --> 24:35.430
being treated
the way you treat me.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.518
I'm fed up.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.345
- Well, I know
I disappointed you.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.520
I'm disappointed, myself,

24:38.564 --> 24:39.652
because the last thing
I wanted to do

24:39.695 --> 24:40.914
was upset you or hurt you.

24:40.957 --> 24:42.568
Certain things
I just shouldn't have said.

24:42.611 --> 24:44.744
It wasn't my business to say,
and that was wrong, and, uh--

24:44.787 --> 24:46.746
- Don't say, "I'm sorry."
- I'm not saying I'm sorry.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.182
I said I disappointed you.

24:48.225 --> 24:49.139
- Please don't, 'cause
I'm not looking for a sorry.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.314
- I'm not saying I'm sorry.

24:50.358 --> 24:51.707
- Okay, good.
- I do care about you.

24:51.751 --> 24:54.144
And I love the way
that we have gotten closer.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.842
And the fact I disappointed
you upsets me.

24:55.885 --> 24:58.497
Maybe I need some--
have to work on myself,

24:58.540 --> 25:00.629
at why I say things that
are hurtful to other people.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.022
And I need to delve.
I need to delve into myself.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.502
- I think you need
to do a deep dive

25:03.545 --> 25:05.678
into the things
that are issues for you.

25:05.721 --> 25:09.246
And, you know,
I have so much sympathy

25:09.290 --> 25:12.511
'cause I think you're really
going through something.

25:12.554 --> 25:13.860
You're drinking more
than you usually do,

25:13.903 --> 25:15.905
which is not like you.
- Right.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.559
- And you're not handling
as well as you normally do.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.561
- Absolutely.
- I hope you're hearing me.

25:19.605 --> 25:20.867
- I'm hearing you
loud and clear.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.172
- I hope we can move on,

25:22.216 --> 25:24.523
and I just want
to see a real change.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.350
- So I know exactly what
you're saying, and I hear you,

25:26.394 --> 25:27.526
and I'm really--you know,

25:27.569 --> 25:28.918
you worked on yourself
tremendously,

25:28.962 --> 25:30.572
and I need to do some work
on myself, absolutely.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.835
<i>- I don't feel angry
with Ramona.</i>

25:32.879 --> 25:34.315
I have sympathy for her

25:34.358 --> 25:37.057
because I feel like
she's a little lost right now,

25:37.100 --> 25:38.580
and that's when
you need your friends.

25:38.624 --> 25:41.191
- Thank you.
I know you

25:41.235 --> 25:43.280
<i>- I hope
she can evolve and grow,</i>

25:43.324 --> 25:44.804
and if not, you know,
I don't know

25:44.847 --> 25:46.196
if we can have a friendship.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.850
I just want you to be good.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.504
- Right, well, I'm not gonna
drink today, until tonight.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.940
- I really want you to be good,
and I care about you,

25:50.984 --> 25:52.463
so I just want you
to know that.

25:52.507 --> 25:53.726
- Okay, and I care about you.
- Okay, let's have lunch.

25:53.769 --> 25:56.206
- You guys, this is delicious.
- All right.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.253
- How's the food?
- Amazing.

25:59.296 --> 26:01.864
How was the talk?

26:01.908 --> 26:05.564
- The talk is good because
I really disappointed Luann.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.653
Everything I did last night
was a betrayal

26:07.696 --> 26:09.916
and not right and not
what a friend should do.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.396
So obviously there's something
in me I need to work on

26:12.440 --> 26:13.615
to make myself a better person.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.489
<i>- Everybody is innately
a good person,</i>

26:18.533 --> 26:20.317
and sometimes
they make mistakes.

26:20.361 --> 26:23.364
Ramona just happens
to make more than most people.

26:23.407 --> 26:26.497
- It's just very hard
for her to play nice.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.151
- She's not going to change.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.544
- Luann's done a lot of work
for herself,

26:29.588 --> 26:31.502
and she's changed tremendously.

26:31.546 --> 26:34.941
And so yeah,
so that's the story.

26:34.984 --> 26:37.030
- Ramona needs a little bit
more yoga in her life

26:37.073 --> 26:38.901
and more sex.

26:38.945 --> 26:41.164
And then she will be chill.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.426
- So we'll see.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.776
- Time will tell.
It always does.

26:43.819 --> 26:44.864
- Moving on.
- Yeah.

26:44.907 --> 26:47.040
- I get to see
my husband tonight.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.868
- Kyle, if I would have known,
I would have brought Louie.

26:48.911 --> 26:50.304
You should have told me.

26:50.347 --> 26:51.784
- Well, he actually had
to come here for business.

26:51.827 --> 26:54.221
- Lucky you.
You're gonna get lucky tonight.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.744
- You have sex
at dinner parties,

26:55.788 --> 26:57.528
so if we see you sitting
on his lap tonight--

26:57.572 --> 26:59.574
- You guys, that was also
when I was younger.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.750
- Show us how it went down,
will you? Please.

27:01.794 --> 27:02.795
- So it's like this.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.318
Let me just go over,
and, honey,

27:04.361 --> 27:07.277
I just want to come sit
on your lap for a minute.

27:07.321 --> 27:08.452
- Ew!
- Ooh, darling.

27:08.496 --> 27:09.497
- And he took it
out of his zipper?

27:09.540 --> 27:10.890
- Yeah.
- What?

27:10.933 --> 27:13.327
- I was like, "Oh, my dress
is bothering me. Oh."

27:13.370 --> 27:15.198
- Oh, so you were like--
- Ahh!

27:15.242 --> 27:16.722
- I don't want to see this.
- So you were like dancing?

27:16.765 --> 27:18.462
And you were like--
- ♪ Ba da, ba da

27:18.506 --> 27:20.116
- Oh, my God.
- So much fun.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.119
We're all having so much fun.
- I'm dancing with you, baby.

27:23.163 --> 27:24.338
- Right.
- I love it.

27:24.381 --> 27:25.992
- And then I was like,
"Okay. I'm done."

27:29.386 --> 27:31.171
- I love it.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.222
- Maybe I should wear this.
I don't know.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.966
- That's sexy. I love that,

27:44.010 --> 27:45.315
But let me see what everyone--
- Yeah.

27:45.359 --> 27:46.577
Let me show you white shorts,
then you tell me.

27:46.621 --> 27:47.753
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.189
Let's check in in a minute.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.453
- Oh, look at how cute.

27:54.368 --> 27:59.373
- Lips, powder, under eye.
Check, check, check.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.768
- It's hot in this hall.

28:04.378 --> 28:05.771
Hi.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.903
So you think you'll be ready
by 7:30? Please, please?

28:07.947 --> 28:09.688
- Is everybody else ready?

28:09.731 --> 28:11.385
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?

28:11.428 --> 28:13.517
- No, no, but you can be ready
in 15 minutes.

28:13.561 --> 28:16.695
Okay, which one do you want
for your eyes?

28:16.738 --> 28:20.524
- Oh, okay. Which one?

28:20.568 --> 28:21.874
Maybe that so it's not so much?

28:21.917 --> 28:23.179
- Fine.
- I don't know.

28:23.223 --> 28:25.007
Which one do you think
I should wear?

28:25.051 --> 28:27.009
Do you like that?
- Very dramatic.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.184
All right, so we'll see you
in ten minutes.

28:28.228 --> 28:30.056
- All right, I gotta hurry up.
My God.

28:33.189 --> 28:36.018
- Melissa, will you be ready
in ten minutes?

28:36.062 --> 28:37.367
- How do I look?
- Ooh, what is that?

28:37.411 --> 28:39.152
- Ooh, look at you.

28:39.195 --> 28:42.503
- Your hands are like ice.
- Sorry.

28:42.546 --> 28:45.288
- I am not putting this on.
- Oh, come on, it's fun.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.116
- No.
You know what I will do?

28:47.160 --> 28:48.291
I'll put them right here
for you.

28:48.335 --> 28:49.510
- All right. Fine,

28:49.553 --> 28:51.164
But make sure to put it
just by your eye,

28:51.207 --> 28:52.600
'cause you know what, everyone
was in such a good mood today.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.297
And don't you--look at me--
when you look at me,

28:54.341 --> 28:55.646
don't you smile when you see
this on my face?

28:55.690 --> 28:59.259
- I do. You just look
so joyous with that on.

28:59.302 --> 29:02.523
Yes to cutouts on a dress.
No to crystals on the face.

29:02.566 --> 29:06.527
<i>Not fashionable.
Not in this decade.</i>

29:06.570 --> 29:08.268
- What did Joey say to you?

29:08.311 --> 29:10.661
- I'm good.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.620
- Hey, Kenya, can I come in,
for a quick second?

29:12.663 --> 29:14.230
- Oh, sure.
- Okay, great.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.710
So I thought
this'd be kind of fun

29:15.754 --> 29:18.060
for everyone to wear
if you're in the mood to do it.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.758
I think they're all beautiful.

29:19.801 --> 29:23.152
- Oh. Hmm.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.893
- I'll give you this, if you
want to put it on the side

29:24.937 --> 29:25.981
or something.
- Oh, okay.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.069
- And if--you know,
you'll decide.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.201
- All right.
- I know we all want

29:28.244 --> 29:29.680
to look good,
and you're looking glam,

29:29.724 --> 29:31.030
as always, and beautiful.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.249
So do you think
you'll be ready, like, by 7:30?

29:33.293 --> 29:36.949
- Probably 7:45.
No later than that.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.646
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.343
- Thank you.

29:40.387 --> 29:43.303
- Ramona's being just as fake
as the crystal on her forehead.

29:43.346 --> 29:47.002
The only reason that she cares
what time I'm going to be ready

29:47.046 --> 29:48.743
is because she needs to know

29:48.787 --> 29:51.833
how quickly she's going to be
seeing her fake boyfriend John.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.400
- All right.
Well, I'm the only one ready.

29:53.443 --> 29:54.880
This is so crazy.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.752
All right, girls.
We're being rude to John.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.232
- I'll be ready
in two minutes.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.451
Tell him he can wait.
- I love you,

30:01.495 --> 30:02.801
and I will see you,
in a little bit.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.585
Bye, honey.

30:04.628 --> 30:05.891
- Hi.
- Gorgeous.

30:05.934 --> 30:07.849
- Hi.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.244
Where is everyone?

30:11.287 --> 30:14.377
<i>- It's weird because, you
know, I'm too old for this,</i>

30:14.421 --> 30:15.814
but, like,
how am I sitting over here

30:15.857 --> 30:16.945
jealous of these folks?

30:16.989 --> 30:18.294
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.905
- Your husband's...
- You look gorgeous.

30:19.948 --> 30:22.124
- Gonna be so happy to see you.
- Thank you.

30:22.168 --> 30:24.039
- Watching them like,
"Oh, yeah.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.085
"Your hair looks so cute.
Oh, my God. I love your dress.

30:26.128 --> 30:29.305
Oh, my God, let's go have
avocado toast together."

30:29.349 --> 30:31.351
<i>I just feel, like,
a little jealous.</i>

30:31.394 --> 30:35.311
Like, I want to go with them
and have avocado toast.

30:35.355 --> 30:39.663
- All right, girls.
Second-to-last night.

30:39.707 --> 30:40.751
- Unbelievable.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.405
<i>- How far away is this place?</i>

30:42.449 --> 30:45.104
We gotta go chase
Ramona's crush all the time.

30:46.583 --> 30:47.976
- I had a fancier dress,

30:48.020 --> 30:49.760
but, like, I heard
it's like a beach, right?

30:49.804 --> 30:51.197
- Yeah.
- Well, it's a beachy--?

30:51.240 --> 30:54.591
- For some reason, he was very,
very firm on this,

30:54.635 --> 30:57.159
that he wanted it outside.

30:57.203 --> 30:58.508
- Maybe he thinks
we're gonna throw stuff?

30:58.552 --> 31:01.163
- No, no, no.
He just likes his beach.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.643
<i>I'm feeling really good.</i>

31:02.686 --> 31:04.645
<i>I definitely feel
Cynthia and I can leave</i>

31:04.688 --> 31:05.907
<i>as good friends now,</i>

31:05.951 --> 31:09.258
and I believe Luann
accepted my apology.

31:10.651 --> 31:11.652
- I don't really care anymore.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.351
- Thank you so much.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.529
This is pretty.
- Landscaping.

31:19.573 --> 31:20.922
- What are these beams?

31:20.966 --> 31:23.533
- It's like,
can you find the house?

31:23.577 --> 31:25.535
- No, that's not funny.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.233
- I'm scared.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.236
- I feel like we're--

31:30.279 --> 31:31.933
- It's like a treehouse
or something.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.935
<i>Wow.</i>

31:33.979 --> 31:36.329
- Oh, wow. This is cute.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.984
- Oh, hey. How are you?
You guys snuck in.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.159
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

31:40.202 --> 31:41.334
- Welcome.
- Good to see you again.

31:41.377 --> 31:42.639
Thank you so much
for having us.

31:42.683 --> 31:43.989
- Oh, my pleasure.
- Hi, John. How are you?

31:44.032 --> 31:45.338
- Very good. Hey.

31:45.381 --> 31:47.035
- Good to see you.
- Hi. How are you?

31:47.079 --> 31:49.211
- I like your dress. I like it.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.778
- Good to see you.
- Thank you for having us.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.258
- Oh, my pleasure.
- This is my husband, Thorn.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.694
- Hello.
This is John's bachelor pad.

31:53.737 --> 31:54.913
- Hi.
- How are you?

31:54.956 --> 31:57.567
- Hi. Nice to meet you again.

31:57.611 --> 31:58.960
- Hey, how are you?
- Look at the sparkles.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.396
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.572
- I can be festive.
You want some sparkles too?

32:02.616 --> 32:05.401
- Ramona, no one wants
those face crystals.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.014
- Hi, Ramona.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.841
- Anyr.
- Anyr, lovely to meet you.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.278
If you're in the mood,
you can have one of these,

32:12.321 --> 32:14.106
if you want to wear one.
- So cute! Thank you.

32:14.149 --> 32:15.542
- Wow. This is pretty.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.936
- This is so nice.
- Oh, wow, look at this beach!

32:17.979 --> 32:19.241
- Yeah, how pretty.

32:19.285 --> 32:20.460
- I've had the property
a long time,

32:20.503 --> 32:23.419
and then I built
the house sort of--

32:23.463 --> 32:26.857
but it's just me and my dogs,
and I'm from a big family,

32:26.901 --> 32:28.120
so I have a lot
of people visit.

32:28.163 --> 32:29.338
- Oh, nice.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.645
John is a staple
of the Turks and Caicos.

32:31.688 --> 32:34.213
<i>He's got his restaurant.
He's got his beautiful home.</i>

32:34.256 --> 32:36.606
He's got a great body,
and there's plenty of women

32:36.650 --> 32:38.478
that would like to be
with John, including Ramona,

32:38.521 --> 32:40.523
<i>and I'm not so sure about that</i>

32:40.567 --> 32:42.961
<i>because there is no look
of love in that guy's eyes.</i>

32:43.004 --> 32:45.093
There just isn't.

32:48.618 --> 32:49.750
- Cheers. Thank you...
- Cheers.

32:49.793 --> 32:50.925
- For cohosting with me.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.622
The setting is prettier
than I imagined.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.842
I know you sent me some photos,
but it doesn't do it justice.

32:54.885 --> 32:56.278
It is a very special place.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.628
- Well, come see it
in the daytime sometimes.

32:58.672 --> 32:59.716
- No, I will.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.762
I like your conch selection,
right?

33:01.805 --> 33:03.024
Those are the conches?

33:03.068 --> 33:05.635
- Have you ever blown
a "conk" horn?

33:05.679 --> 33:06.636
- Cock.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.857
- No, "conk."
- C-O-N-C--conch.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.467
There's an N in there.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.165
- Conch.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.602
- You wait here.
I do have one.

33:15.645 --> 33:16.995
- Oh, boy.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.258
John has
an amazing conch selection,

33:19.301 --> 33:22.130
named after the conch shack.

33:22.174 --> 33:23.218
He's gonna blow the horn--

33:23.262 --> 33:24.132
- You've never been
here before?

33:24.176 --> 33:25.525
- No.
- Blow what horn?

33:25.568 --> 33:27.135
- What does "blow a horn" mean?
- The conch horn.

33:27.179 --> 33:29.050
- Oh, people do that?

33:31.835 --> 33:33.359
Wow.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.317
- That's like a shofar.
We do that in temple.

33:35.361 --> 33:37.711
- Does that mean
dinner's ready?

33:37.754 --> 33:39.017
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.453
- Oh, hey.

33:40.496 --> 33:41.932
- How are you?
- Hi.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.717
- Look what the cat dragged in.
How you doing?

33:48.113 --> 33:50.550
- How are you?
- You look so handsome.

33:50.593 --> 33:51.855
- How's it going?

33:51.899 --> 33:53.379
Ah, are you guys having gone--
are you good?

33:53.422 --> 33:55.685
- I think it's really cute
that Mauricio stopped in.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.296
It's actually making me
miss Joe right now.

33:57.339 --> 34:01.169
I wish he could just pop in
magically for a little dinner.

34:01.213 --> 34:02.388
- All right.
- Let's all go for dinner.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.693
- Should we...
- Yeah. Why don't we--

34:03.737 --> 34:05.826
- Head down to the beach
for dinner?

34:05.869 --> 34:06.783
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.046
- Lead the way.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.484
- Ah, good. The bar's set up.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.138
- Hey, we don't mess
around here.

34:13.181 --> 34:15.183
I gotta make sure the caterer
stocked a full bar down here.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.098
- Can we be best friends
for the rest of time?

34:17.142 --> 34:20.188
- Of course we can!
Forever and ever.

34:20.232 --> 34:21.885
- I'm gonna find you
a nice Jersey boy.

34:21.929 --> 34:23.104
- Forever and ever.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.280
- And how about
a nice Italian boy? No?

34:27.456 --> 34:31.547
- Wow, John. Very impressive.
Your own private beach?

34:31.591 --> 34:33.767
- It's true.
- So are you seating people?

34:33.810 --> 34:35.073
- It's seated.
Yeah. The caterer seated it.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.378
- Oh, you already seated it?
Oh, cool.

34:36.422 --> 34:37.684
- Yeah. The caterer did it all.
- Oh, okay.

34:37.727 --> 34:38.902
- So I don't even know where he
put everybody,

34:38.946 --> 34:40.817
to tell you the truth.
I just saw Ramona.

34:40.861 --> 34:42.471
Oh, do you see your name?
- Oh, I'm right here.

34:42.515 --> 34:43.820
- Okay.
- Well, there you go.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.606
- I love Ramona's taken
over the hostess seat,

34:46.649 --> 34:48.216
right next to John

34:48.260 --> 34:50.044
and, like, answering
John's questions for him.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.219
- What kind of water
for you guys?

34:51.263 --> 34:52.307
- Oh, sure,
I would love flat water,

34:52.351 --> 34:53.439
and I think
he'd like sparkling.

34:53.482 --> 34:56.137
- Which is so Ramona.

34:56.181 --> 35:00.576
<i>♪</i>

35:00.620 --> 35:02.274
- Oh, thank you.
It looks delicious.

35:04.624 --> 35:06.669
- I think the setting is--
- The setting is phenomenal.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.236
- This island is beautiful.
- Right?

35:08.280 --> 35:11.152
- Everything we've done,
the backdrop has been--

35:11.196 --> 35:12.110
- Extraordinary?
- Oh, yeah.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.241
- It's really beautiful.

35:13.285 --> 35:14.155
- Your wife was
in a bubble today.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.939
- Oh, my goodness.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.854
- You know those balls like
a hamster's in, and they roll?

35:17.898 --> 35:19.769
They put us in one today.

35:19.813 --> 35:22.163
- Don't go too far!
- Well, don't let go of that!

35:22.207 --> 35:23.599
- Okay. I'm not letting go.

35:23.643 --> 35:25.862
Look, it's tied to my waist.
I got you, girl.

35:25.906 --> 35:28.604
- Do I go anywhere,
or I just keep doing this?

35:28.648 --> 35:31.868
- Your wife is hilarious.
I love her.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.348
- We're having fun.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.742
- She's always up to,
like, a good time.

35:38.266 --> 35:41.748
- I love that you joined in on
the, um, the party with that.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.358
I just stuck
something right here.

35:43.402 --> 35:44.664
- No. I love these things.

35:44.707 --> 35:45.926
- I think you were
the only one that--oh, no.

35:45.969 --> 35:47.014
Cynthia did them too.

35:47.057 --> 35:47.971
- Yeah.
Cynthia has them I think.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.408
- What is that?

35:49.451 --> 35:50.626
- You have to go out past the--
- What do you need?

35:54.456 --> 35:56.328
- So I want to thank John
for allowing us to do this.

35:56.371 --> 35:57.633
Thank you, John.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.157
- Oh, my pleasure.
Thank you for coming.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.289
- Thank you for co-hosting
this with me, I appreciate.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.378
The place is even prettier
and more beautiful

36:03.422 --> 36:05.902
than you described.
Seriously, it's magical.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.252
This is special.

36:07.295 --> 36:08.992
- Like, so you own all of this?
- Three acres.

36:09.036 --> 36:11.865
- Oh, so beautiful. Yeah.

36:11.908 --> 36:14.172
- I would never leave here.
Ever.

36:14.215 --> 36:15.869
- No children.
Never been married.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.000
Living on an island.

36:17.044 --> 36:18.828
I mean, I think
you are the epitome

36:18.872 --> 36:22.223
of what men wish
they would have done.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.833
- Yeah.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.531
- So what is
the right woman for you?

36:25.574 --> 36:27.228
Like, what's your type?

36:27.272 --> 36:28.838
What are you looking for?
What's the right woman for you?

36:28.882 --> 36:30.927
- I don't know
that I'm looking for anything,

36:30.971 --> 36:32.929
'cause I'm happy with
what I--I mean I love--

36:32.973 --> 36:34.148
- Yeah.
- I love--

36:34.192 --> 36:35.497
- What would you like
to fall in--

36:35.541 --> 36:38.239
- Intelligence, intelligence.
- Mm-hmm.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.849
- You know, beauty fades,
but you know--

36:39.893 --> 36:45.507
- So Luann is very intelligent,
and obviously,

36:45.551 --> 36:48.902
she's very funny,
so do you have a physical type?

36:50.425 --> 36:52.297
- Poor John.
- Don't put him on the spot.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.255
He's a host. I mean--
- Well, let's see.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.604
- We're having a conversation.
- Let's do this.

36:55.648 --> 36:58.259
Does he like blondes
or brunettes?

36:58.303 --> 37:00.174
- Ay-yi-yi.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.655
<i>- I feel bad for Ramona
'cause I know she likes John,</i>

37:02.698 --> 37:04.352
<i>but, see, this is the thing.</i>

37:04.396 --> 37:09.009
You can't keep poking the bear
because when you poke the bear,

37:09.052 --> 37:11.490
you never know
how the bear's gonna react.

37:11.533 --> 37:14.188
<i>Ramona went for Kenya
a lot of times.</i>

37:14.232 --> 37:17.800
"Oh, they're a bitch,"
and you know, "you,"

37:17.844 --> 37:20.107
and now Kenya's like,
"you."

37:20.150 --> 37:22.892
- I've spent some time
with you guys, and you know,

37:22.936 --> 37:25.547
a couple--and I was expecting
a little more drama, and--

37:25.591 --> 37:27.636
and you guys all seem
to like each other,

37:27.680 --> 37:30.552
and it's really refreshing
and nice. No, I mean--

37:30.596 --> 37:32.859
- I'm gonna do the Heimlich
on Ramona.

37:32.902 --> 37:34.121
- You weren't paying attention.
- All right.

37:34.164 --> 37:35.557
Apparently, I wasn't.

37:35.601 --> 37:36.950
- There were moments.
Don't get it twisted.

37:36.993 --> 37:38.952
- I do like everyone,
but we had some moments.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.823
- Since the beginning
of the trip.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.129
- You should have seen
what happened

37:42.172 --> 37:43.957
on the yacht the other day.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.175
- What happened on the yacht
the other day?

37:45.219 --> 37:46.264
- Oh, it was nuts.
- Oh.

37:46.307 --> 37:47.874
- We both want to hear.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.310
- Do we have to repeat stories?
- Yeah.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.485
- We're all on such
a good page here.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.182
- Oh, my God.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.228
- We had a crazy idea.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.622
- Do we have to really talk
about it right now? Really?

37:56.665 --> 38:00.278
- They were talking about
Ramona tried to blackmail...

38:00.321 --> 38:02.149
- Actually, no, it's not true,

38:02.192 --> 38:03.498
and you're wrong.
- Luann.

38:03.542 --> 38:04.586
- I would never
blackmail anyone, so...

38:04.630 --> 38:05.848
- And then what else?

38:05.892 --> 38:06.980
- Why are you making up
lies, Kenya?

38:07.023 --> 38:08.808
- What else happened?
- Oh, my gosh.

38:18.078 --> 38:19.949
<i>- They were talking about...</i>

38:19.993 --> 38:22.778
Ramona tried
to blackmail Luann.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.911
- Actually, no. It's not true.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.042
Why are you making
up lies, Kenya?

38:26.086 --> 38:28.567
- What else happened?
- Oh, my gosh.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.351
<i>- It's almost like
when you're at, like,</i>

38:30.395 --> 38:32.005
<i>dinner with your children, and
you're grinding your teeth,</i>

38:32.048 --> 38:33.441
and you're like,
"You better behave."

38:33.485 --> 38:35.617
Ramona was like, "Girls,
we're gonna behave nicely.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.271
We're at my friend's house,"

38:37.315 --> 38:39.839
and then Kenya's like,
"Yeah, no. We're actually not."

38:39.882 --> 38:41.971
- I got cursed at,
and then, you know,

38:42.015 --> 38:43.930
she told me to off.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.888
And then there was crying
and running around,

38:45.932 --> 38:47.586
and it was like,
"Oh, my God. Okay."

38:50.023 --> 38:52.808
Well, she was looking like
she was crying,

38:52.852 --> 38:56.421
but there were actually no
tears coming out of her eyes.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.513
- Wow.
- It's an interesting story.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.384
- And I love you, too, Kenya.
- Yeah. It's a lot.

39:03.428 --> 39:04.733
- Cheers to Kenya.

39:04.777 --> 39:06.561
- I don't think you do.
- Yeah. It was kinda--

39:06.605 --> 39:08.955
- 'Cause she said,
"you" to me

39:08.998 --> 39:10.391
and "off."

39:12.393 --> 39:14.569
- Do you really think this is
the right time and place?

39:14.613 --> 39:16.745
- Yeah, it was that.
- You need that much drama now?

39:16.789 --> 39:18.486
- We were talking about things
that happened, so--

39:18.530 --> 39:20.401
- We're at a beautiful
man's dinner.

39:20.445 --> 39:21.663
I'm hosting it.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.362
- You're having a great time,
right, John?

39:24.405 --> 39:25.972
- Yeah, but I want everyone
to be happy, too, right?

39:26.015 --> 39:28.366
- We're happy. We're laughing.
- I thought we were all happy.

39:28.409 --> 39:29.758
I thought we were having
a great day.

39:29.802 --> 39:31.020
- We're happy and laughing.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.022
- Who in the world
is totally happy?

39:33.066 --> 39:35.373
- What does "happy" mean?
- I don't know.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.287
- What is this thing
you call happy?

39:39.986 --> 39:42.031
- I'm actually embarrassed
because John

39:42.075 --> 39:44.338
and our other guests
do not need to hear this.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.993
This is not proper
dinner conversation,

39:47.036 --> 39:49.387
and this is really low,
even for Kenya.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.214
- I'm just playing
with everybody.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.739
- And Luann, right now,
is just a little bystander.

39:53.782 --> 39:56.742
Not saying, "Hey, Kenya, stop.
Not good conversation."

39:56.785 --> 39:59.440
Miss "Manners."
Miss "Etiquette."

40:07.579 --> 40:08.797
Please don't tell me no.

40:08.841 --> 40:10.582
- You, you, you, you.
- Go, now. Go, now.

40:13.628 --> 40:15.238
- But we have to do it,
in any case.

40:15.282 --> 40:16.544
Just for the fun of it.
- Just for the fun of it.

40:16.588 --> 40:18.111
- Let's razz her.

40:18.154 --> 40:21.593
Little flirting with John,
and give Ramona a little razz.

40:21.636 --> 40:23.377
That's what I'm looking for.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.467
Giving her the medicine
she probably needs.

40:26.511 --> 40:29.731
Oh, I have my opportunity.
- Yes. Do it.

40:29.775 --> 40:33.387
- This situation reminds me
of that movie "Carlito's Way."

40:33.431 --> 40:36.477
- Oh, pretty.
- That's so beautiful!

40:36.521 --> 40:38.087
<i>Remember, he's trying
to escape.</i>

40:38.131 --> 40:40.742
He's trying to get on the train
with the love of his life,

40:40.786 --> 40:43.919
and the guy calls his name,
and said, "Remember me?"

40:43.963 --> 40:45.660
And then shoots him
right there.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.532
- Oh, we're going to have
to do some s'mores, John.

40:47.575 --> 40:48.837
- Yes, we are.

40:48.881 --> 40:51.187
- Do you have any?
Marshmallows too?

40:51.231 --> 40:53.059
<i>- Kenya is Benny Blanco.</i>

40:53.102 --> 40:55.670
- Chocolate, marshmallow.
- Graham crackers.

40:55.714 --> 40:58.281
- Ramona's not gonna make it
out of this dinner

40:58.325 --> 41:00.109
with the love of her life,
the way it's going.

41:00.153 --> 41:01.633
- Can't handle this part.

41:01.676 --> 41:04.070
She's running right in
on her man.

41:04.113 --> 41:05.506
- Are you from Toronto or--
that's right.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.247
Oh, awesome.

41:07.290 --> 41:10.816
- I used to take my hoops off
for like that.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.339
- I grew up in Toronto.
My family's from Toronto.

41:12.382 --> 41:13.906
My mom was from Toronto.
- Look at her.

41:13.949 --> 41:15.995
- She can't take it.
- Aw...

41:16.038 --> 41:17.213
- I love Toronto.
- Does it hurt?

41:17.257 --> 41:18.737
- Toronto's one of
the best places ever.

41:18.780 --> 41:19.955
- Can you believe it?
I've never been to Toronto.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.391
Gonna have to come and visit.

41:21.435 --> 41:22.828
- I think I need to go
to the ladies' room.

41:22.871 --> 41:24.525
- The two Canadians look
pretty damn good together.

41:24.569 --> 41:26.396
- Toronto is, like,
an amazing city.

41:26.440 --> 41:27.963
I really think it's
the most international city,

41:28.007 --> 41:29.487
in the world.

41:29.530 --> 41:30.966
- Excuse me, I'm sorry
to interrupt your conversation,

41:31.010 --> 41:32.402
but I'm gonna go
to the ladies' room.

41:32.446 --> 41:33.795
So I just go right up,
and what bathroom do I use?

41:33.839 --> 41:35.275
- You can go--
- By the kitchen? Don't they--

41:35.318 --> 41:36.232
- No, no.
Don't go all the way up.

41:36.276 --> 41:37.669
There's one right here.

41:37.712 --> 41:39.148
- Where?
- Right there.

41:39.192 --> 41:42.500
No. Toronto's amazing.
It's like...

41:42.543 --> 41:44.545
- Lu, where's the ladies' room?

41:46.591 --> 41:48.984
- Ramona, come--
- I don't know where to go!

41:49.028 --> 41:51.900
- Try the path, Ramona.

41:51.944 --> 41:53.249
- Can you show me
the ladies'--okay.

41:53.293 --> 41:55.513
Someone will escort me.
Thank you. Thank you.

41:57.689 --> 42:00.648
<i>- I understand Kenya
being upset with Ramona,</i>

42:00.692 --> 42:03.651
but I would rather see her
pushing her off the paddleboard

42:03.695 --> 42:06.349
<i>than doing what she's doing
right now with John.</i>

42:06.393 --> 42:09.178
- Where did Cynthia's go?
- It feels bad,

42:09.222 --> 42:12.573
and I don't think anybody
is not noticing that.

42:12.617 --> 42:14.923
- It's hard to be mean when
somebody's actually being nice.

42:14.967 --> 42:16.229
- Not only that.

42:18.884 --> 42:20.363
- She likes him,
and she's having a good time.

42:20.407 --> 42:21.451
Like, she's probably
been looking forward...

42:21.495 --> 42:22.496
- And we don't want to be--

42:22.540 --> 42:23.845
- To this night
the whole night,

42:23.889 --> 42:26.587
and then that's
when it turns into, like--

42:26.631 --> 42:28.589
- Instead of making me
feel bad, it only--

42:28.633 --> 42:29.982
- No.

42:30.025 --> 42:32.114
I don't like, "Like, okay.
Let's just be mean now."

42:32.158 --> 42:34.552
- Oh, the s'mores
must have arrived,

42:34.595 --> 42:36.118
'cause those girls
love s'mores.

42:36.162 --> 42:38.251
- Can I be honest about what
we were just talking about?

42:38.294 --> 42:40.427
- Sure.
- We were feeling bad

42:40.470 --> 42:41.950
about the whole thing that
just happened at the table.

42:41.994 --> 42:43.865
- Why would she bring this up
now in front of our host?

42:43.909 --> 42:45.475
- Because You have underlying
issues you haven't resolved.

42:45.519 --> 42:47.390
- But you don't do it
at a dinner.

42:47.434 --> 42:48.609
At a seated dinner.
- Okay, I understand that.

42:48.653 --> 42:50.002
- It's called time and place.
Wrong.

42:50.045 --> 42:51.438
- That's why you guys have
to talk.

42:51.481 --> 42:52.482
- From the moment I met her,
she always was saying

42:52.526 --> 42:54.223
antagonistic things to me.

42:54.267 --> 42:55.703
And she tried
to push my buttons,

42:55.747 --> 42:57.139
and I usually am pretty good
about gut feelings.

42:57.183 --> 42:59.098
Like, I see her
having fun with you,

42:59.141 --> 43:00.273
and we're laughing,
and we're snorting.

43:00.316 --> 43:02.188
- I see her...
- Snorting.

43:02.231 --> 43:03.711
- Kind of over by Kyle, like
I don't want her to have fun.

43:03.755 --> 43:05.147
- Why are they snorting,
over there, having a good time?

43:05.191 --> 43:06.584
- But she's like--I feel like
she's even resentful

43:06.627 --> 43:09.064
that I'm bonding with--
whether it's you or you

43:09.108 --> 43:10.326
or her or her.

43:10.370 --> 43:12.198
I don't need to feel bad
about myself.

43:12.241 --> 43:14.940
Like, she'll say I do
A, B, C, and D to Luann.

43:14.983 --> 43:16.115
It's not true. That's a lie.

43:16.158 --> 43:17.595
- What were the A, B, C, D?
Tell me.

43:17.638 --> 43:19.248
- Whatever.
Those were all lies.

43:19.292 --> 43:20.989
Kenya's had a stick up her butt
from the moment she met me.

43:21.033 --> 43:23.601
But even for Kenya,
this is out-of-the-box rude.

43:23.644 --> 43:26.212
<i>I realize that everybody
can't like everyone,</i>

43:26.255 --> 43:28.170
and at this point,
I am not liking Kenya,

43:28.214 --> 43:30.216
and I have no interest
in her as a friend.

43:30.259 --> 43:32.697
- Obviously, Kenya is making
those comments

43:32.740 --> 43:34.002
because they still
have not resolved these things.

43:34.046 --> 43:35.482
- Yeah.

43:35.525 --> 43:36.614
- She got a problem with me,
but don't demean me

43:36.657 --> 43:38.616
and be nasty
in front of all my peers.

43:38.659 --> 43:41.488
That is wrong. It's not classy.
It's not elegant.

43:41.531 --> 43:43.185
- Okay, but you have
to get a point

43:43.229 --> 43:44.665
where you guys can have
a conversation.

43:44.709 --> 43:45.927
- Every conversation--
all right, I'll figure it out.

43:45.971 --> 43:47.886
- Well, I really like Kenya
and Ramona both,

43:47.929 --> 43:52.064
and watching Ramona be hurt
by Kenya is making me feel sad.

43:52.107 --> 43:54.936
- I'm gonna get you to dance.
- Nobody wants that.

43:56.590 --> 43:58.897
- We have one day
left on the island,

43:58.940 --> 44:01.639
and I know that both of these
women are great people,

44:01.682 --> 44:03.162
but they're not gonna see that
in each other

44:03.205 --> 44:05.991
unless they sit down and have
an actual conversation.

44:06.034 --> 44:07.645
<i>But we're running out of time.</i>

44:07.688 --> 44:10.517
- Boom. There you go, see?
You're dancing! There you go.

44:10.560 --> 44:14.521
Boom. There you go.

44:19.352 --> 44:22.224
<i>♪</i>

44:22.268 --> 44:23.965
- Everyone, safe home.

44:24.009 --> 44:26.794
- Well, we don't have to worry
about you 'cause you are home.

44:26.838 --> 44:28.666
- And I don't need
to worry about you

44:28.709 --> 44:30.537
going to too many bars
'cause I think they're all--

44:30.580 --> 44:31.930
- I think they're all...
- I think they're all closed.

44:31.973 --> 44:33.279
- Shut down.

44:33.322 --> 44:36.717
- What if I go with you?
Maybe no one will notice.

44:36.761 --> 44:38.980
- You know what, you should
give me your contact.

44:39.024 --> 44:40.895
- I will. How do I do that?

44:40.939 --> 44:43.245
- I am--do you have your phone?
- Yes.

44:43.289 --> 44:44.551
- Good. You take mine.

44:49.730 --> 44:51.819
<i>- Luann loves to flirt.
I could care less.</i>

44:51.863 --> 44:53.560
He's all yours, Luann,
if you want him.

44:53.603 --> 44:57.216
- He was dancing with Kenya.
He's getting Luann's number.

44:57.259 --> 44:59.435
-
- I mean...

44:59.479 --> 45:02.830
- And then you text me,
and then I have your number.

45:02.874 --> 45:04.527
- That's how it works?
- That's how it works.

45:04.571 --> 45:07.182
Last time I checked,
unless you have an update.

45:07.226 --> 45:08.531
- Ladies.
- Yes?

45:08.575 --> 45:10.316
- I'm being naughty and leaving
with my husband.

45:10.359 --> 45:11.839
- Aw...
- Good.

45:11.883 --> 45:13.580
- As you should. We wouldn't
expect anything less.

45:13.623 --> 45:15.843
- I have no makeup remover,
nothing.

45:15.887 --> 45:18.063
- You don't need it.
- Are you going for a nightcap?

45:18.106 --> 45:20.543
- She'll spend the night.
- No. I'm going for--

45:20.587 --> 45:22.067
- She'll come back,
walk the shame, at 7:00.

45:22.110 --> 45:23.938
- A nightcap. Rrr!

45:23.982 --> 45:25.070
- All right. Lots of love.

45:25.113 --> 45:26.854
- Love you, ladies!
- Bye.

45:26.898 --> 45:28.421
<i>- Have good sex.</i>
