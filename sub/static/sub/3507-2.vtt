00:13.500 --> 00:15.500

00:19.300 --> 00:20.400
Mr. Castle

00:20.400 --> 00:25.200
Be advised, if you get injured following detective beckett to research your novel,

00:25.200 --> 00:26.500
You cannot sue the city.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.900
If you get shot, you cannot sue the city.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.800
If you get killed-- My lifeless remains cannot sue the city.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.100
Your heirs, mr. Castle.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.400
Do i have to wait for him to sign, or can i shoot him now?

00:36.400 --> 00:39.600
Mr. Castle, these waivers  are serious business.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.100
Perhaps you'd feel mo comfortable

00:41.100 --> 00:43.200
<i>By referring the matter  to your attorney?</i>

00:43.200 --> 00:45.900
What, are you kidding?  He'd never let me sign these.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.500
But fortunately, it's his job  to get me out of trouble

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
And not to prevent me  from getting into it.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.300
Beckett.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.700
Yeah. Where?

00:55.300 --> 00:57.700
All right, i'm on my way.  Whoa, wait. Uh, where are you going?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.800
I have work to do. What? We have a case?

00:59.800 --> 01:02.700
No, i have a case. You have paperwork.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.500
So?  Mrs. Rosenberg, 9-E here,

01:09.500 --> 01:11.100
Comes down to put her clothes  in the dryer,

01:11.100 --> 01:12.500
Finds it's occupied.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.300
Comes down a half an hour later  and she's had enough,

01:15.300 --> 01:17.500
Decides to take matters  into her own hands.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.300
Come on. You're telling me that

01:18.300 --> 01:20.900
An old lady killed someone over a busy dryer?

01:20.900 --> 01:23.900
What? No, she's just tired of waitin' around.

01:23.900 --> 01:26.100
So she opens up the dryer

01:26.100 --> 01:28.200
To take the otheperson's clothes out,

01:29.200 --> 01:31.800
Finds miss fluff and fold here instead.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.600
Now if that's not a cautionary tale

01:34.600 --> 01:36.200
About poking around someone else's laundry,

01:36.200 --> 01:39.300
I don't know what is. Dude, there is an etiquette involved.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.100
If the clothes were dry,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.600
Mrs. Rosenberg had every right  to put 'em in the basket.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.500
Now if you're gonna tell me  that she folded 'em,

01:44.500 --> 01:47.800
Then it gets a little creepy.  I'm sorry, someone starts rootin' around my underwear

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
Without an invitation,

01:48.800 --> 01:51.000
I'm taking that as a serious breach of hygiene.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.100
I thought you went commando, esposito.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.600
Well... seasonal thing.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.100
All right, let's get her out of there with some dignity.

01:58.100 --> 02:00.400
And we need c.S.U. To come down here, and the bleach bottle

02:00.400 --> 02:01.500
Will have to go down to the lab,

02:01.500 --> 02:02.800
And probably prints and photographs,

02:02.800 --> 02:03.200
Although i don't know

02:03.200 --> 02:05.100
If it's gonna do us much good  in a public area.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.000
I'm guessing she lived here?

02:08.000 --> 02:11.700
Worked. 12-F. She's the nanny.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.200
Thought you ditched me back at the precinct, didn't you?

02:18.900 --> 02:21.500
Come on. Nanny mcdead is found on spin dry.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.600
You don't think the captain's gonna let me in on that story?

02:25.100 --> 02:26.400
You're right, castle.

02:26.900 --> 02:27.900
My bad.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.900
Exactly how much longer do i have to expect you

02:37.900 --> 02:39.500
Toe shadowing me  on my cases like this?

02:39.500 --> 02:41.300
Hard to say. When i'm writing a new character,

02:41.300 --> 02:44.400
There's no telling when inspiration might strike. I thought i was  your inspiration.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.200
Oh, you are, detective, and in so many ways.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.300
Yeah, well, your inspiration  might strike you

02:49.300 --> 02:50.600
Sooner than you think.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.200
Nanny's name was sara manning.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.600
She worked for the petersons  about two years.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.700
The doorman is a huge fan of my work.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.300
Mrs. Peterson?

03:01.700 --> 03:03.500
Detective kate bkett, nypd.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.600
I was wondering if i could ask you

03:04.600 --> 03:08.200
Some questions about sara manning.  Of course. Please come in.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.300
Thank you.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.800

Sweetie, mommy and daddy need  to talk to some people,

03:22.500 --> 03:24.000
But we'll be right out here.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.200
We still haven't told him what happened.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.200
We just don't know how.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.800
Sara was  very close with him.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.700
She just had--Has a-A gift with kids, you know?

03:34.100 --> 03:35.700
She was such a lovely girl.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.300
I'm very sor. The school called me at my office

03:38.300 --> 03:40.100
When sara didn't come to pick up justin.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.300
I-I tried her cell phone,

03:41.300 --> 03:43.600
But it went straight  to voice mail.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.600
Then i tried here, but the machine picked up.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.900
So i hopped in a cab and went to the school.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
When we got home, the police were already here.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.200
When was the last time  you saw sara?

03:53.600 --> 03:57.500
My husband saw her last night  when he got home.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.900
We take justin to school every morning,

03:59.900 --> 04:03.200
So we're usually gone  by the time she gets here.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.200
And what time is that?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.100
Today it would have been 11:00.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.200
Sara straightens up, does justin's laundry

04:09.200 --> 04:12.000
And then picks him up from school about 2:00.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.500
One of us then home for dinner.

04:14.900 --> 04:19.200
Last night it was my husband's turn.  So then you were the last one to see sara?

04:19.700 --> 04:23.000
I-I guess so.  Did she mention any problems she was having,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.500
Uh, maybe a boyfriend? Sara's boyfriend?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.200
The--The doorman said

04:28.200 --> 04:30.300
Th-The police told them that it was a break-In,

04:30.300 --> 04:33.400
Which usually means  a stranger did it. We can't be sure what happened.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.400
Well, maybe not, but statistically speaking,

04:35.400 --> 04:38.800
Much greater likelihood  that it was someone she knew. Oh, my god.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.000
Again, we can't be certain  who was involved.

04:42.100 --> 04:46.000
<i>But she had a boyfriend.  Brent. But they broke up.</i>

04:46.000 --> 04:49.200
And when was that?  About a month ago, but sara never said there was any trouble

04:49.200 --> 04:52.100
Or anything like that.  Brent--That was his name?

04:52.300 --> 04:55.000
Yes.  Do you know his last name?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.700
Uh, i don't think sara  ever mentioned it.  Not to me, either.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.900
Thank you both so much  for your time.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.100
Of course.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.700
Castle, let's go. But--That's it?

05:06.700 --> 05:07.700
That's it.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.700
Oh, do you know of any way i could reach sara's parents?

05:10.900 --> 05:14.100
Oh, god. I hadn't even thought of that.

05:14.900 --> 05:17.100
I-I'm sorry. We don't have their number.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.600
Yeah. They live in atlanta. She  was with them over christmas.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.400
What about sara's things? There's her bag and her jacket.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.000
Maybe i could take it  and check her cell phone?

05:27.100 --> 05:29.000
Why couldn't wstick around? I had a lot mo questions.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.100
Because i actually like to investigate things myself first.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.300
Besides, neither of them  is going anywhere.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.200
Well, there's no cell phone  in here.  Maybe it's in the laundry room or in the dryer.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.100
Well, if it is, c.S.U. Will find it.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.900
She's still got her georgia license.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.500
Are you really the one who has to call her parents?

05:47.300 --> 05:49.800
Easier to write about than to live through, huh, castle?

05:54.700 --> 05:56.900
Three men huddled around a computer.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.300
That better not be porn, and if it is, i want in.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.800
Esposito and ryan  pulled security tape

06:00.800 --> 06:04.000
From an elevator in the rear entrance. Front door has  a 24-Hour doorman.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.000
This is the elevator's cam.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.200
Our victim gets on the elevator with the laundry basket.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.800
Takes it down to the basement,

06:10.800 --> 06:12.900
Puts the kid's clothes in the washer.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.400
A few minutes later, gets back on,

06:15.400 --> 06:17.200
Goes all the way  back up to the apartment.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.400
Then about 40 minutes later,  rides the elevator back down

06:20.400 --> 06:22.600
To the basement again.  Weigure probably  to take the kid's clothes

06:22.600 --> 06:26.100
Out of the washer,  put 'em in the dryer.  Camera never  picks her up again.

06:26.100 --> 06:28.400
Only other person to ride  the elevator down all the way

06:28.400 --> 06:30.800
To the basement during  the next hour was the old lady

06:30.800 --> 06:34.500
Who found the body.  So whoever attacked her must have used the stairwell,

06:34.500 --> 06:38.700
Otherwise the camera would have got him. We got three maintenance  workers on duty that day.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.500
We'll run their names tonight.  Why only run  the workers' names?

06:41.500 --> 06:43.100
Why not run  all the neighbors' names?

06:43.400 --> 06:44.900
What are you basing that on?

06:45.400 --> 06:47.100
I'm basing that on...

06:47.100 --> 06:48.900
The neighbor would make a better story.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.800
No, come on.  At do any of us know

06:51.800 --> 06:53.400
About our neighbors in this city?

06:53.400 --> 06:56.900
You think the guy living next door to the son of sam knew he was living next door to the son of sam?

06:56.900 --> 06:58.500
He's right. Neighbors in berkowitz's building

06:58.500 --> 07:00.200
Had no idea he was the son of sam killer.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.500
Thank you.  What about the guy in 8-B?

07:02.500 --> 07:03.400
Who?

07:03.500 --> 07:06.200
8-B. Quiet guy.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.900
You see him every day,  only you never notice him.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.400
But he noticed sara.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.500
She's young, beautiful,

07:13.700 --> 07:14.800
The kind of girl that a guy like him

07:14.800 --> 07:15.700
Would never have a chance with.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.400
We all know girls like that,  don't we?

07:19.600 --> 07:22.700
Well, at first it's just a game. Figure out her schedule.

07:22.700 --> 07:26.500
When does she do her laundry? When is she alone?

07:27.500 --> 07:29.200
Until it becomes something more,

07:29.400 --> 07:31.800
Something that  he can't control.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.100
Well, he uses the stairs,  obviously,

07:34.100 --> 07:36.000
To avoid the elevator's cameras.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.600
And then he just waits,

07:38.300 --> 07:40.100
Concealed in the shadows.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.500
When she comes into that laundry room,

07:42.500 --> 07:43.700
He pounces.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.900
When he looked into her vacant, lifeless eyes,

07:47.900 --> 07:51.300
He wanted to tell her  he never meant to kill her.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.700
All he ever wanted  was to be noticed.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.900
That's when he felt the heat  of that dryer on his skin.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.300
So he picks up her limp body  in his arms

08:03.900 --> 08:06.000
And gently places it inside.

08:06.700 --> 08:10.000
He almost smiled  at his good fortune

08:10.000 --> 08:11.700
When he found the quarter in his pocket,

08:11.700 --> 08:13.700
Slipping it into the slot.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.600
Buying him the time  to do what he does best...

08:21.100 --> 08:22.400
Disappear.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.200
Just saying, bter story. Coffee?

08:31.200 --> 08:33.100
Let's see what we can find out about those neighbors.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.799
And someone better tell me who the hell lives in 8-B.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.600
Let me guess. Gran cooked.

08:42.600 --> 08:46.100
Chicken masala. And where is hurricane martha?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.900
In her room taking a dramatic pause.

08:48.900 --> 08:53.100
Leaving the mess for everyone else to clean up, as usual. I don't mind. Dinner was fun.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.700
<i>Well, it's our room, not hers...</i>

08:56.000 --> 08:56.800
Just remember.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.600
Even despite that hideous  bedspread she bought.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
If you're hungry, there are lots of leftovers.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.900
Oh, thank you. I grabbed a slice on the way home.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.400
You really are turning into a cop.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.600
Yeah? Do you think?

09:08.900 --> 09:11.100
So who got killed today?

09:11.100 --> 09:12.500
The nanny.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.500
Do they know who did it? Well, apparently  in an actual homicide,

09:16.500 --> 09:18.600
They don't know who did it until after the guy gets caught.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.200
How come we never  had a nanny? Well,  your mother and i decided

09:22.200 --> 09:24.700
If someone was gonna screw  you up, we wanted it to be me.

09:25.100 --> 09:28.200
Only you managed to turn out fine somehow anyway. Surprisingly.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.700
Is that the prodigal son i hear,

09:30.700 --> 09:34.600
Returned from working  the night shift?

09:34.900 --> 09:37.100
You catch any perps today,  kiddo?

09:37.100 --> 09:41.100
I did an "nypd blue" once, remember? You were  the crazy homeless woman.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.000
And some might say  still are.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.800
I was just asking dad

09:44.800 --> 09:46.900
How come we never had a nanny when i was little.

09:47.300 --> 09:50.000
I spared her any stories of my own personal experience.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.400
I had a real job as a working actress.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.600
You know, not everybody can sit at home

09:54.600 --> 09:57.600
In front of a laptop and claim to be employed.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.500
<i>Really? You had a nanny?</i>

10:00.500 --> 10:03.600
Yeah, only we didn't  call 'em nannies then. What were they called?

10:03.600 --> 10:06.700
Oh, i don't know.  Um... alcoholics?

10:06.700 --> 10:08.200
Raving lunatics?  No, no, no, wait.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.800
Uh, completely irresponsible  middle-Aged women who,

10:10.800 --> 10:12.000
Instead of looking after me

10:12.000 --> 10:13.500
While you were acting, like they were supposed to,

10:13.500 --> 10:17.800
Instead watched daytime television.  Oh, stop your whining. You didn't turn out half bad.

10:17.800 --> 10:21.000
And don't forget, the good half are my genes. Well, that's just something

10:21.000 --> 10:22.700
We'll have to take your word for, isn't it?

10:22.700 --> 10:24.400
But i'm not asking for an apology, mother.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.800
Actually, i got the plot  of my first novel...

10:26.800 --> 10:29.500
By watching "one life to live." There you go.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.600
Detective beckett, did you miss me already?

10:32.600 --> 10:34.800
Which means  i am one-Quarter responsible

10:34.800 --> 10:39.000
For your success as well.  Really? Do they do those  at night? No, for sure.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.900
I'm just--I'm just touched that you thought of me.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.000
Oh, ordered to call me? I see.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.300
Well, either way. I, uh, can leave right away.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.900
Okay. Gotta go.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.500
I would say don't wait up,  but you'll be asleep by 11:00.

10:52.500 --> 10:56.300
10:30. It's a school night. Are you sure she's got either one of our genes?

10:56.300 --> 10:59.100
Ah, well.  You will help her  with the dishes?

10:59.100 --> 11:02.800
All right. Be careful... flatfoot.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.900
Here, put these on.

11:07.000 --> 11:07.800
Really?

11:08.200 --> 11:10.400
I thought cops  just stood around the body

11:10.400 --> 11:12.700
Eating ham sandwiches  and crackin' jokes--

11:13.000 --> 11:14.700
You know, hard-Core gallows humor.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.400
The head trauma definitely  contributed to the death.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.500
The force of the blows

11:22.500 --> 11:25.500
Resulted in significant  cerebral hemorrhaging.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.800
Mr. Castle,  nice to see you again.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.100
I wish i could say the same, but my glasses are all scratchy.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.300
How often do they let you replace these?  Not everybody has  your budget, castle.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.500
So what killed her?  I'd say she was struck in the head with the bleach bottle,

11:39.500 --> 11:42.900
Then fell forward, hit her temple on the edge of the table.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.500
That caused  temporal bleeding.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.300
Without medical attention,  she didn't stand a chance.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.900
But what i thought you  might find really interesting

11:50.300 --> 11:52.100
Is the fact that she had sex

11:52.100 --> 11:54.300
Hours before her death.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.700
Sex? I'll explain how that works later.

11:56.700 --> 11:59.100
Might have even been within a few minutes of the murder.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.500
The heat from the dryer  makes it hard to pinpoint. So you're saying she was raped?

12:02.500 --> 12:05.400
Hard to determine. There were  no vaginal lacerations

12:05.400 --> 12:08.300
Or presence of any semen. So what's the evidence of sex?

12:08.300 --> 12:11.900
Traces of spermicide.  The guy wore a condom.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.900
Boy, it really has been a long time for you, hasn't it?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.600
I mean,  it could have been a rape,

12:16.600 --> 12:19.000
But myest guess is--  She knew the guy.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.500
Without evidence of trauma,

12:28.500 --> 12:31.500
I'm not ready to buy our attacker as a sexual predator,

12:31.900 --> 12:34.100
Especially with him  using a condom.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.200
Could be he's trying to hide d.N.A.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.900
Dude, someone smart enough to hide d.N.A.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.900
Would have been smart enough not to have sex in the laundry room. No, you're missing the point.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.000
The laundry room afforded opportunity.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.500
It wasn't an accident she was killed there.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.300
Esposito, where are we  on her cell phone?  I pulled her records,

12:49.300 --> 12:50.900
Had her service provider ping it.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.100
Triangulation puts it at or near the building.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.800
Yeah, well, maybe he took it so she couldn't call for help,

12:54.800 --> 12:58.900
Then dumped it somewherelose by. What about her ex-Boyfriend? We have a first name--Brent.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.800
But if we had her cell phone, he might be in the address book. What about these calls?

13:01.800 --> 13:04.600
What calls? Last two months, there's dozens of incoming calls

13:04.600 --> 13:06.500
From the same number.  Right. We're still  running that down,

13:06.500 --> 13:08.000
But the number's a prepay.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.300
Besides,  those calls stopped coming

13:09.300 --> 13:10.600
A couple weeks before she was killed. Yeah,

13:10.600 --> 13:14.500
But the outgoing calls to that number stop even before that.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.500
Whoever it was, she didn't  want to talk to them. She was letting it go to voice mail.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.000
Find this brent, bring him in for questioning.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.500
You're here by invitation only.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.300
Got it?

13:28.300 --> 13:29.800
Got it.  Good.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.300
Brent johnson?

13:31.300 --> 13:32.200
Yeah.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.200
I'm detective kate beckett. This is... m castle.

13:35.700 --> 13:39.500
I suppose you know why you're here. Um, the cops that  picked me up at my job

13:39.500 --> 13:42.100
Said you had some questions about what happened to sara.

13:42.100 --> 13:46.500
I understand that  the two of you were dating?  Yeah, till about a month ago.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.800
A month ago?  What happened then?

13:49.200 --> 13:52.700
Nothing. We broke up. Whose idea was that?

13:52.900 --> 13:55.300
It was a mutual thing, i guess.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.700
A mutual thing?

14:00.500 --> 14:03.200
<i>Hey, sara,t's me. Well, just call me back, okay?</i>

14:04.000 --> 14:06.700
<i>You can't just not call me  back, sara. Don't be a bitch.</i>

14:07.400 --> 14:08.700
<i> Come on, sara,  i just want to talk to you.</i>

14:08.700 --> 14:10.100
<i>Look, i don't know why you can't just tell me</i>

14:10.100 --> 14:11.300
<i>Who this other guy is.</i>

14:11.900 --> 14:14.900
<i>You know... you know what?  You're just a little slut.</i>

14:16.500 --> 14:19.600
There's plenty more of those. Yep. They make alec baldwin's messages

14:19.600 --> 14:22.200
Sound like rainbows  and unicorns.  How did you get those?

14:22.200 --> 14:24.900
From your service provider. A little advice--

14:24.900 --> 14:27.900
When you buy a prepaid phone, don't e your credit card.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.400
Makes it totally traceable. I wasn't trying  to hide anything.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.500
No? Then why did you just lie to me?

14:35.600 --> 14:37.600
'Cause no man likes  getting dumped.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.800
Am i right? Our egos can't handle it.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.900
This one time i had an ex-Girlfriend cheat on me,

14:41.900 --> 14:45.000
I drank every meal for a week.  I didn't even like her.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.800
If i had loved her? Wow. I don't know...

14:48.600 --> 14:50.200
What i would have done.

14:50.200 --> 14:53.000
No, no. No way. It wasn't like that.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Oh, no. So then how did you  find out about sara

14:56.000 --> 15:00.900
If you two broke up  a month ago? From a friend. Chloe. Chloe richardson.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.300
All right? We all went  to college together.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.500
Chloe's the one  who got sara her job. And how did this friend  find out?

15:05.500 --> 15:07.700
Chloe nannies for another family in the building.

15:07.700 --> 15:12.200
The two of 'em  are pretty close. So then where were you the day that sara got killed?

15:12.200 --> 15:14.600
I was where those other cops found me, at my job.

15:14.700 --> 15:17.800
Look, we have video cameras there

15:17.800 --> 15:19.200
And a sign-In sheet.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.300
Look, i didn't have  anything to do with this.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.400
Am i und arrest or something?

15:25.900 --> 15:28.400
No. You can go.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
But just don't leave town until we speak again.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.300
Do you understand?

15:34.200 --> 15:36.000
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.300
"Don't leave town"?

15:44.300 --> 15:46.400
Don't you need probable cause  for something like that?

15:46.800 --> 15:48.400
Only he doesn't know that, does he?

15:49.500 --> 15:54.000
You can lie like that? That is so cool. Castle.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.600
Doorman told esposito that this is the playground

16:00.600 --> 16:02.100
That all the nannies for the building go to,

16:02.100 --> 16:05.600
So hopefully we find chloe here.  That brings me back a bit.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.400
A bit? I'm thinking it's a little more than that, castle. I wasn't talking about when i was a kid.

16:09.400 --> 16:13.000
I'm talking about when i used to  take my daughter to the park. You used to take your daughter to the park?

16:13.300 --> 16:15.300
Spring, summer, fall. We were here every day.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.100
Alexis' mom was doing community theater.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.800
She was on the road a lot, so i had custody. What?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.400
Nothing. I just never figured you for mr. Mom.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.400
Some of the best days of my life.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.300
That's actually kind of nice. Yeah, tell me about it.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.000
Do you know how many lonely  single mothers there are

16:30.000 --> 16:32.100
On a manhattan playground?  And there i was,

16:32.300 --> 16:36.300
Between marriages. Exactly how many times have you been rried, castle?

16:36.300 --> 16:37.700
Twice. That's it?

16:37.900 --> 16:41.800
Isn't that enough? How about you? Me? No, never been.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.100
Really? Yeah.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.100
You'd be good at it.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.300
<i>You're both controlling and disapproving.</i>

16:46.500 --> 16:49.200
You should really try it. I'm not an "if at first,  you don't succeed"

16:49.200 --> 16:50.000
Kind of a girl, castle.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.100
When it comes to marriage,

16:51.100 --> 16:53.400
I'm more of a "one and done" type.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.900
Any serious candidates?

16:59.100 --> 17:02.400
Becca! The doorman said she'd have a red vest on.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.300
That might be our girl.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.400
Go, go, go!

17:05.400 --> 17:06.200
Chloe?

17:08.200 --> 17:10.300
I'm detective beckett. Was wondering if i could ask you

17:10.300 --> 17:12.200
Some questions about sara manning.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.900
Um, right--Right now?

17:16.900 --> 17:18.300
Yeah, it won't take long.

17:19.599 --> 17:23.200
Yeah, uh, maggie?  Can you watch becca for a sec?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.800
Sara's boyfriend told us that you helped her get her job.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.500
Uh, you talked to brent?

17:29.400 --> 17:31.200
Yeah, when--When we  got out of school,

17:31.200 --> 17:32.300
Sara couldn't find work.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.100
She was temping all over town.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.300
I nanny for a family  in the same building

17:36.300 --> 17:38.600
And heard that the petersons  were looking for someone.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.800
When was the last time you saw sara?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.100
I know what it feels like to lose somebody, chloe,

17:47.100 --> 17:48.700
But we need to ask you these questions.

17:48.700 --> 17:49.600
Yeah.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.300
Um, sometimes we'd  meet up before work,

17:54.300 --> 17:55.600
Get a coffee on columbus

17:55.600 --> 17:57.200
And then walk over to work together.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.000
Did you get coffee that day? Yeah.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.400
Did she say anything to you?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.900
Did she seem upset?

18:06.200 --> 18:07.900
Upset? Upset about what?

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
Brent gave us the impression

18:09.600 --> 18:11.700
That sara was seeing someone else.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.600
You know who it was, don't you?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.200
Sometimes sara would stay late.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.200
Stay late where,  at the petersons'?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.200
Ah, we got off work around the same time,

18:25.200 --> 18:26.300
So we'd take the train home together.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.700
I live with a roommate  a couple blocks from sara.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.600
Only the last few months,  she'd been staying late.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.000
Mr. And mrs. Peterson  kind of take turns

18:36.000 --> 18:37.800
Coming home for dinner,  you know?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.700
Yeah,  mrs. Peterson told us.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.200
God. I-I don't want to say something, and then...

18:46.100 --> 18:47.800
I mean--I mean, he's married.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.400
Wait a minute. Sara td you about him?

18:51.600 --> 18:54.500
No. No, not exactly.  It's just...

18:55.600 --> 18:58.000
The nights mrs. Peterson didn't come home for dinner...

18:59.900 --> 19:02.400
Those were the only nights  sara stayed late.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.200
I told you we should have asked the husband

19:08.200 --> 19:10.700
More questions that day. And i told you that i like to question

19:10.700 --> 19:12.800
My most likely suspects  after i know more about them.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.700
That way they're tied  to more specific answers. You suspected him, too?

19:16.800 --> 19:20.800
The husband? Duh. You would really clean up at my poker game.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.100
Right. You, james patterson

19:22.100 --> 19:23.600
And the rest of the "times"  best seller list?

19:23.600 --> 19:27.000
Thank you, castle.  Little too rich for my blood.  We could always make it strip poker.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.400
Sorry, but i prefer mystery to horror. No, yeah, i'm--  I'm in the space right now,

19:30.400 --> 19:31.400
But like i told you guys,

19:31.400 --> 19:33.700
I'm gonna need  at least 20,000 square feet.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.400
I... listen, i'm gonna give  you guys a call back.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.000
I'll let you know if the client is interested, okay?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.500
Thank you. Hi. Remember us?

19:45.400 --> 19:47.700
When was the last time you saw sara, mr. Peterson?

19:47.700 --> 19:51.100
The night before she was killed. I told you that. Which was your night to be  home for dinner, right?

19:51.100 --> 19:53.600
Right. W-Why are you asking?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.200
Well, mr. Peterson-- Unh-Unh-Unh.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.300
We have information that suggests

19:57.300 --> 19:59.800
That sara manning  was having a relationship.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.700
Right. She had a boyfriend.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.600
Someone else.  Someone else? Who?

20:06.400 --> 20:08.800
Me? You think i was having  an affair with sara?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.500
Bingo. That is--That's crazy.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.500
Is it? We know that she stayed late some nights.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.600
Right. She helped us  make dinner.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.500
"Us"? Well, what we heard  was that she helped

20:19.500 --> 20:21.500
On the nights that  your wife wasn't home.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.000
First of all, it's not what you think. When is it ever?

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Yes, i was having an affair.  So what happened?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.100
What do you mean, what happened? I cheated. I strayed.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.700
Whatever you want to call it.  I mean in the laundry room.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.200
What?

20:42.200 --> 20:44.300
You just said that you--  Yes, i was having an affair,

20:44.300 --> 20:46.400
But it wasn't with sara, for god sakes.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.500
It was with another woman in my office.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.000
Look, every night that i was

20:50.000 --> 20:52.300
Supposed to be home having dinner, i wasn't.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.000
You can check the landlines  from the apartment.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.700
I called to make sure that sara was okay every night.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.000
You can--You can check  cell phone records, right?

21:04.300 --> 21:05.500
Don't leave town?

21:10.800 --> 21:11.800
Hey, what happened  with the husband?

21:11.800 --> 21:14.000
Oh, he was cheating,  just not with our victim.

21:14.300 --> 21:17.900
Here, i need you to run it down.  This iher name. I'm telling you,

21:17.900 --> 21:19.700
True commitment's a thing of the past.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.200
I mean, name one happily married couple.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.800
Degeneres and de rossi.  Ooh, i think he's got you  there, bro.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.300
What is this, "the view"?  Where are we on the boyfriend?

21:27.300 --> 21:31.800
His story checks out-- Video and a sign-In sheet.  Great. So now all we have is a cheating husband

21:31.800 --> 21:33.800
With a possible alibi  and no cell phone

21:33.800 --> 21:36.500
To run the perp's fingerprints. I got something better.

21:36.500 --> 21:40.500
Please tell me it's that the mayor wants him outta here.  Have you ever noticed how she gets a little grumpy

21:40.500 --> 21:42.900
When she doesn't have a suspect? Well, we got one now.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.700
Guess who wasn't where they say they were

21:44.700 --> 21:47.600
The day sara manning  was killed?  Who?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.100
Come on, you gotta guess.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.200
Ryan. Ryan.  I'm not guessing.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.100
You're a killjoy, you know that? Exactly what i've been telling her.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.100
No way.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.000
Pretty good, huh? Told you you should've guessed.

22:10.000 --> 22:10.800
You weren't at the office

22:10.800 --> 22:12.500
The day sara manning was killed, were you?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.500
You ed, mrs. Peterson.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.000
Detective ryan checked with your son's school.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.100
The day they called  about sara not showing up,

22:19.100 --> 22:23.500
Your assistant said that  you were unreachable. What are you talking about?

22:23.500 --> 22:25.300
I'm talking about  sara manning, mrs. Peterson.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.700
We're talking about  why you lied

22:26.700 --> 22:28.400
About where you were the day she was killed.

22:28.400 --> 22:32.400
And we know you weren't in your office.  It would have been easy to sneak into the building.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.500
Doorman could have been  outside hailing a cab,

22:34.500 --> 22:35.600
Taking a delivery.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.600
My husband is having an affair.

22:41.700 --> 22:42.800
Did you know that?

22:43.600 --> 22:44.700
Actually, we did.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.700
All these months,  i had no idea.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.900
But then you found out. Yeah, sara told me a few weeks ago.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.000
Sara told you  about the affair?

22:53.000 --> 22:57.300
Yes, and she'd been an absolute wreck about keeping it from me. Yeah, i bet she was.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.800
Did you know he was paying her extra?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.700
No, he didn't mention that. Imagine putting sara

23:02.700 --> 23:04.800
In the middle of something like that.  Something like what?

23:04.800 --> 23:07.000
Well, using sara to cover for himself.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.700
I mean, it's disgusting.  I don't understand, mrs. Peterson.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.300
If you had nothing to do  with sara's death,

23:11.300 --> 23:15.500
Then why would you lie? Because my cheating husband has no idea

23:15.500 --> 23:18.200
I'm about to serve him with divorce papers.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.700
I lied because i was at my lawyer's that afternoon.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.500
Howard's not the only one who can keep a secret.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.100
* don't be, you-- *

23:36.100 --> 23:38.200
Hello there!

23:38.200 --> 23:40.400
What are you up to?

23:40.400 --> 23:41.600
Nothing.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.100
You're not webcamming again, i hope.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.200
I burned a dvd from security cameras...

23:47.200 --> 23:50.300
<i>That the police are looking at. And i've never webcammed.</i>

23:50.300 --> 23:53.200
That's your story, and you're sticking to it, huh?

23:53.200 --> 23:56.000
The police just let you  burn a dvd?

23:56.300 --> 23:57.000
You do reali

23:57.000 --> 23:59.100
You're gonna have to stop  stealing evidence, right?

23:59.100 --> 24:01.600
I thought the whole purpose of following this detective around

24:01.600 --> 24:04.700
Was to help you to write. It's called research, mother.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.600
Well, you'd better hope

24:06.600 --> 24:09.500
This last derrick storm book sells, lover boy,

24:09.500 --> 24:12.800
Because research don't pay the... bills.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.500
Is that the nanny?

24:15.700 --> 24:17.100
What married woman  in her right mind

24:17.100 --> 24:20.100
Invites a girl that pretty into her own home?

24:20.900 --> 24:22.700
Hey. Hey.

24:22.700 --> 24:25.700
<i>What are you guys watching? I'm watching. She's butting in.</i>

24:26.100 --> 24:28.100
The police can't find the nanny's cell phone.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.000
They were hoping to lift  some fingerprints from it.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.100
I just thoug i could see it she had it with her

24:32.100 --> 24:34.300
When she went down  to the laundry room. And?

24:34.300 --> 24:36.400
It's in her hand the first time she brings the clothes

24:36.400 --> 24:37.700
Down to the wash,  but then she doesn't have it

24:37.700 --> 24:41.700
When she goes down  to use the dryer.  So... she probably left it

24:41.700 --> 24:44.000
Upstairs in the apartment  where she worked.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.600
They say they can't fi--  Find it. Wait a sec.

24:47.800 --> 24:48.600
What?

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
There's a 5-Second time difference.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.500
A 5-Second time difference in what?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.200
She rides the elevator twice to the basement.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.700
The first time to put  the clothes in the washer,

25:00.700 --> 25:02.300
The second time  to put them in the dryer--

25:02.300 --> 25:05.200
Only the second time, the trip takes her five seconds longer.

25:05.300 --> 25:09.600
Why would it take her longer to travel the same distance?  It wouldn't.

25:10.100 --> 25:13.400
I'm not quite sure where you're going with this, castle. Up.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.900
All right, 32 seconds.

25:15.900 --> 25:19.500
It takes 32 seconds to get from the basement to the 12th floor.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.200
Great. I'll alert the media.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.500
Only the second time, it took her 37 seconds.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.400
Why would it take her  five extra seconds? Because the second time,

25:29.400 --> 25:31.100
She wasn't coming from the 12th floor.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.800
She was coming from the...

25:34.100 --> 25:38.300
15th floor? This doesn't make any sense.

25:38.300 --> 25:42.100
The petersons live on 12. Yeah, but i bet the guy who  wears that condom lives on 15.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.500
By the way,  that whole elevator thing?

25:43.500 --> 25:45.200
I just did that  'cause you smell nice.

25:45.700 --> 25:48.300
Castle, you can't just knock on people's doors. Why not?

25:48.300 --> 25:51.000
Who is it? Because you're gonna  freak them out.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.200
Police!

25:55.200 --> 25:57.500
You're the police? Uh, she is.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.500
I'm sorry. Do you live here alone?  Yeah. Why you wanna ow?

26:02.500 --> 26:04.800
Uh, don't worry about it. You're not young enough. Young enough for what?

26:04.800 --> 26:08.300
To have sex. Uh, what kind of cops did you say you were?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.100
He's not a cop. I'm a cop.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.200
And you're looking for someone to have sex with?

26:14.600 --> 26:15.900
Castle, look.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.700
So sorry to bother you.

26:21.500 --> 26:25.500
77 ain't beyond the realm of possibili, ya know?

26:26.100 --> 26:28.200
Pardon me,  is this little girl becca?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.500
I'm sorry. I'm not sure i'm following.

26:31.500 --> 26:32.300
Prior to her murder,

26:32.300 --> 26:35.200
We believe that sara manning was coming from this floor.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.200
Well, i don't know anything about that. I was at work.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.900
Maybe she came up  to see chloe?  Chloe richardson?

26:42.900 --> 26:43.900
She and sara were friends,

26:43.900 --> 26:46.300
And our kids get togetr sometimes for playdates.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.400
Hey, babe. What's going on? I thought you were going out.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.900
It's the police. Police?

26:52.900 --> 26:54.900
They think chloe's friend sara might've been up here

26:54.900 --> 26:56.100
The day she was killed.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.600
Wait, you were home that day, right? .

26:59.400 --> 27:01.000
What--What-- What day was that?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Tuesday.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.900
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I was--I was--I was here.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.000
So did you see sara?

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
I don't think so. No.  You don't think so?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.300
No.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.500
Mind if i use your bathroom?  People never think about that.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.000
When do cops  use the bathroom?

27:18.900 --> 27:21.100
It's right there. Thank you.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.100
So... tuesday.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.100
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let me think a minute. Um...

27:44.200 --> 27:47.700
So you're saying that you can't say one way or the other?

27:47.900 --> 27:50.100
After chloe got here to take care of becca,

27:50.100 --> 27:51.900
I went inside to take a nap.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.000
I work most nights.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.700
Condoms.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.700
And what is it that you do, mr. Harris?

27:58.700 --> 28:00.000
Oh, i'm a musician.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.200
Condoms in the bathroom.

28:02.500 --> 28:05.100
So anyway, it's--It's possible that sara was up here.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.800
I just... couldn't really  say for sure.

28:07.800 --> 28:11.100
You know, maybe you should  talk to chloe about this.  I already have.

28:11.100 --> 28:14.300
And what did she tell you?  She said that she saw sara earlier in the day,

28:14.300 --> 28:15.300
But she didn't say athing

28:15.300 --> 28:17.100
About sara being in your apartment.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.800
What else would she  be doing up here?

28:26.100 --> 28:27.400
What is that?

28:27.600 --> 28:29.400
That sounds like  somebody's cell phone.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.200
Ian... who the hell's phone is this?

28:50.700 --> 28:51.600
Why was her phone in your bedroom?

28:51.600 --> 28:53.800
Maybe she dropped it. I don't--I don't--I don't know.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.800
You told me you went into the bedroom to take a nap.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.300
How could she go into  the room, drop the phone,

28:58.300 --> 29:00.600
And you not see her?  She's right. It doesn't make sense

29:00.600 --> 29:03.000
When you think about it.  We're running a test on the condoms we found

29:03.000 --> 29:06.500
In your medicine cabinet. (Chuckles) now there's something you never wanna hear.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.500
If the spermicide's a match,  you're facing a murder charge. Well, i-I didn't kill sara.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.100
But you were  sleeping with her.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.800
Look, we had sex, okay?

29:22.800 --> 29:25.200
But when sara left my place,  she was fine.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.900
You followed her down to the basement, didn't you?

29:27.900 --> 29:29.300
You followed her in the basement,

29:29.300 --> 29:31.600
And then you killed her.  No! I wouldn't hurt sara.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.800
You wouldn't hurt her? You're a married man sleeping with her

29:33.800 --> 29:36.400
In your own bed. What time did she leave your apartment?

29:37.400 --> 29:39.800
A little before 1:00. How can you be sure?

29:39.800 --> 29:41.700
Because chloe gets back from the park with becca

29:41.700 --> 29:44.100
Every day around 1:00 to give her her lunch.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.900
And sara left maybe ten minutes before chloe got back.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.900
Look, you ask chloe, she will tell you i was there.

29:50.900 --> 29:53.100
There's no way that i could've killed sara.

29:53.100 --> 29:55.400
Detective beckett? Frank garrison.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.500
I've been retained to represent mr. Harris,

29:57.500 --> 29:58.500
And i'm directing him

29:58.500 --> 30:02.100
Not to answer any more of your questions.  Your client can answer my questions here

30:02.100 --> 30:04.000
Or he can answer them  in front of a grand jury.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.200
If you've got enough to charge him, do it.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.600
Otherwise, he's coming with me. Let's go, mr. Harris.

30:14.300 --> 30:15.000
Guess it's a lot tougher

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
When they actually know the rules, huh?

30:22.800 --> 30:23.700
Thank you.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.100
Lab says  condoms are a match.

30:26.100 --> 30:29.400
So we can prove they had sex? Look, if chloe  got home at 1:00,

30:29.400 --> 30:31.300
Then there's no way he had time  to get down to the basement,

30:31.300 --> 30:34.500
Kill sara  and make it back upstairs. Maybe we ought to  pick chloe up,

30:34.500 --> 30:37.200
See if she backs his story.  We don't have to.

30:38.100 --> 30:38.900
Why not?

30:40.500 --> 30:42.400
Because the elevator cam  had a time stamp.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.500
Our suspect says that sara left his apartment about 12:45,

30:45.500 --> 30:47.500
And the camera  in the elevator puts her on it

30:47.500 --> 30:50.900
Headed towards the basement  at 12:48.  We think she was murdered  maybe ten minutes later.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.400
So what are we looking for?  The nanny who worked for the guy.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.300
We're just trying to check out his story. He claims she got home at 1:00,

30:56.300 --> 30:57.900
And that he never left the apartment again.

31:01.300 --> 31:04.200
Ah, there she is. 12:54.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.800
Okay, that's six minutes

31:05.800 --> 31:07.300
After sara manning  got on the elevator.

31:07.300 --> 31:10.600
Well, i guess harris was telling the truth.  (Beckett) wait.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.300
What? Wait, where's the kid?

31:12.300 --> 31:14.300
Where's what kid? Becca.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.000
The little girl  that chloe takes care of.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.100
Maybe she left the kid in playground

31:19.100 --> 31:22.700
With one of the other nannies.  Harris said that she came back with his daughter

31:22.700 --> 31:25.300
At the same time every day. What difference does it make?

31:25.300 --> 31:27.000
The diffence is that there are no coincidences,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.600
Not when murder's involved. Chloe would've known  sara's schedule, and chloe

31:29.600 --> 31:32.600
Would've known that sara was  in the basement at that time. Pick her up.

31:36.300 --> 31:38.800
Can i help you?  Does chloe richardson live here?

31:38.800 --> 31:42.200
Yes, but she's not here  right now.  Where did she go?

31:42.200 --> 31:44.600
Into the city.  Do you mind if i take a look around?

31:44.800 --> 31:49.300
No. But... (scoffs) i'm telling you, she's not here.

31:49.300 --> 31:51.100
She left about an hour ago.

31:51.800 --> 31:52.900
Detective.

31:53.900 --> 31:55.500
That's the family  that chloe works for.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.400
<i>Not exactly  the whole family.</i>

31:58.400 --> 32:00.300
She cut the mom  out of the picture.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.800
Where in the city  did chloe go? To their apartment.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.700
She said that they needed her to babysit tonight.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.800
She must've found out that i took harris in for questioning.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.200
If she talked to his wife, she'd know he'd been released.

32:09.500 --> 32:13.200
And we both know what she does to people she doesn't like.  She's going after ian harris.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.200
We better find her  before she fin him.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.300
No answer in the apartment when the doorman called upstairs.

32:26.300 --> 32:27.400
(Ryan) but he's sure  chloe's there.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.000
He says ian harris is up there, too.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.600
Came home about an hour ago.  Which means chloe would've  been there waiting for him.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.500
All right, we don't have time to wait for emergency services.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.800
We're gonna have to  go in on our own. (Esposito) whoa. What about him?

32:35.800 --> 32:38.800
He stays here. Whoa! No! Come on! Come on!  I already signed my life away.

32:38.800 --> 32:42.500
What more do you want? Okay, castle, but it's accompany and observe,

32:42.500 --> 32:46.100
Not participate and annoy. Got it?  Participate and annoy's  a lot more fun, but all right.

32:46.100 --> 32:47.100
And stay behind us in the hallway,

32:47.100 --> 32:52.100
And don't move unless i tell you.  Hope to die. You know what i mean. It's...

32:59.000 --> 32:59.900
Open door.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.200
I got a victim down, guys. Stack 'em up.

33:05.300 --> 33:09.100
Police! New york city police! (Woman) we're here! We're here!

33:09.100 --> 33:10.000
Mrs. Harris?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.800
In here! I-I locked us in the bathroom.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.800
Room all clear! Check him!

33:15.600 --> 33:18.800
Mrs. Harris, are you okay? Is your daughter with you?  Yes. Yes, we're okay.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.100
(Rn) he's still alive. Mrs. Harris, is chloe there?

33:21.100 --> 33:23.300
No, no, it's just me and becca.

33:23.300 --> 33:26.000
Apartment's all clear. Chloe's not here.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.400
You can come out now,  mrs. Harris.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.400
Where's chloe, mrs. Harris? I don't know.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.800
She must've used her key. I-I was just giving becca a bath.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.300
I didn't even know  she was here.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.700
That's the doorman from downstairs.

33:39.700 --> 33:42.600
Answer it.  Hello.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.800
Thank you. I'll tell her.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.500
Doorman says a tenant called.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.700
There's a girl in the laundry  room, and she's got a knife.

33:53.800 --> 33:54.600
Where's the girl?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.500
She's inside, just sitting there.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.100
Esposito, get these people  out of here.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.700
Let's go. Everybody up the stairs.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.000
Come on, let's go.

34:01.100 --> 34:04.500
So what's the plan?  To get everyone out this alive.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.100
Good plan.

34:09.199 --> 34:12.199
You don't go in.  Do you understand? Yes.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.300
Okay.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.100
Chloe?

34:18.100 --> 34:21.199
Chloe, it's detective beckett. Do you remember me?

34:22.300 --> 34:24.000
Please just go away.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I'm sorry, chloe, but i can't do that.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.699
Look, chloe,

34:32.900 --> 34:33.800
You're hurt.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.000
Why don't you put the knife  away, and let me help you?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.199
Oh, why don't you just shoot me?

34:39.500 --> 34:41.500
Hey, look at me. Look.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.300
No one's gonna shoot anyone.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.500
Okay?

34:50.800 --> 34:54.699
Unless it's you if you take another step inside, castle.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.400
He was sleeping with sara.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.500
I know.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.200
Only the--The whole time,

35:07.400 --> 35:09.100
He was sleeping with me.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.100
<i>And he was telling me  that he loved me,</i>

35:13.100 --> 35:17.200
<i>That he was gonna leave his wife for me.</i>

35:19.300 --> 35:21.800
Guys can be like that sometimes, chloe.

35:23.300 --> 35:26.100
They can lie, and i know when you find out

35:26.100 --> 35:28.100
How much  it could break your heart.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.600
I'm pregnant.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.300
Well, that's even more reason for us to get you some help.

35:37.500 --> 35:38.600
Right?

35:43.300 --> 35:44.700
Look, i...

35:46.200 --> 35:48.300
I just wanted to talk to her.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.200
That's all.

35:50.400 --> 35:54.100
I just wanted to--To tell her that ian and i were in love.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.400
I know wt happened to sara  was an accident, chloe.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.400
I know that.

35:58.100 --> 36:01.500
I left becca in the park, and i went up to the apartment

36:01.500 --> 36:04.600
To see if it was true, 'cause, uh...

36:05.900 --> 36:08.000
I'd seen the way he was looking at her.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.300
As soon as i saw ian's bed,  i knew.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.700
He went to take a shower, so i--

36:15.700 --> 36:17.800
I came down here,

36:18.200 --> 36:20.600
Just to talk to sara.

36:21.100 --> 36:23.200
I know you didn't mean to kill her, chloe.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.500
Sara was my friend, you know?

36:26.500 --> 36:28.100
But she just-- She didn't...

36:28.300 --> 36:30.400
<i>She didn't get it. (Chuckles)</i>

36:30.600 --> 36:33.600
She didn't get how we felt about each other.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.800
So when--When she turned around,

36:36.800 --> 36:40.200
I just... grabbed the bleach,  and i hit her with it.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.000
And she fell.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.900
And i was so scared. I didn't...

36:45.400 --> 36:47.800
I didn't know what to do,  so i just...

36:48.200 --> 36:49.900
I put her in the dryer.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.500
<i>I was so angry...</i>

36:57.500 --> 37:00.000
You know, just so mad.

37:01.100 --> 37:04.800
Chloe,  put the knife down, okay,

37:05.000 --> 37:06.600
And let me help you.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.900
Just put the knife down.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.500
Come on.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.400
God, i'm so stupid.

37:35.100 --> 37:36.300
It's okay.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.900
So... looks like i managed to make it through the case

37:58.900 --> 38:00.800
Without getting injured, shot or killed.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.400
Yeah, well, maybe tomorrow.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.000
By the way,  i really liked that whole,

38:07.000 --> 38:08.900
Uh, sisterhood thing you ran back there.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.600
I wasn't running anything, castle.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.700
What that guy did had consuences,

38:13.700 --> 38:15.400
Only he'll g to just walk away.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.100
Well, not scot-Free.

38:18.100 --> 38:20.200
I mean, i-I sense a pretty big divorce settlement

38:20.200 --> 38:24.200
In his future.  Whatever it is, it won't be enough.

38:40.300 --> 38:47.900
Moment was... her heart had once been broken.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.000
So... did you guys get him?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.200
On their way up the river  as we speak.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.700
Cool. Was it who you thought?

38:55.900 --> 38:58.100
Actually, it wasn't.

38:59.300 --> 39:01.700
It must've been a pretty good story to surprise you.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
You know, you better be careful

39:04.000 --> 39:06.200
Or you'll turn into one of your readers.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.800
Oh. Oh, okay, you just ruined it.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.700
You know, it's okay to be surprised sometimes.

39:14.700 --> 39:15.900
That's the fun.

39:16.900 --> 39:18.400
You surprise me,

39:18.700 --> 39:20.200
All the time.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.000
I'll see you in the morning, dad.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.300
Good night, pumpkin.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Dad?

39:32.200 --> 39:33.800
Thanks for being my nanny.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.100
No sweat, kiddo.
