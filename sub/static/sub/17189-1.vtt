WEBVTT

00:17.070 --> 00:19.390
'Private Dawes. Report to the OC.'

00:23.030 --> 00:24.070
Relax, Dawes.

00:26.270 --> 00:28.180
Bit cold out there, isn't it?

00:28.230 --> 00:30.060
Yes, Sir. Tater's, Sir.

00:30.110 --> 00:32.780
You'd better go and pack
your sun cream, Dawes.

00:32.830 --> 00:35.390
You're off to Afghan and it's 47 degrees.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.310
'Battle casualty replacement.'

00:46.830 --> 00:50.140
'You've done well on your
mission specific training

00:50.190 --> 00:53.470
so you've got tonight to
say goodbye to your family.'

01:04.510 --> 01:06.270
'It's not going to be easy, Dawes.'

01:12.270 --> 01:16.950
'You're serving your
country. Do yourself proud.'

01:24.070 --> 01:26.140
'Brize Norton, 1100 hours tomorrow.

01:26.190 --> 01:28.020
You're to report to a Corporal Kinders

01:28.070 --> 01:30.670
and be attached to his
section, under Captain James.'

01:33.470 --> 01:37.630
'First impressions are
important. Make the right one.'

01:39.150 --> 01:40.270
Private Dawes?

01:42.270 --> 01:43.310
Yes, corporal.

01:44.390 --> 01:46.630
Welcome to the Under Fives.

01:51.870 --> 01:55.830
Right, Dawes, you are with 2
section. Double in and join them.

02:11.630 --> 02:15.660
Can it really take you massive
cockwombles this long to

02:15.710 --> 02:17.990
get into your sections
for a bloody photograph?

02:21.270 --> 02:23.140
What are you laughing at, medic?

02:23.190 --> 02:24.630
Cockwomble, Sir.

02:27.310 --> 02:30.500
For the benefit of our
alleged new medic, who are we?

02:30.550 --> 02:32.110
The Under Fives, Sir!

02:34.230 --> 02:36.470
And why d'you think
we're called that, medic?

02:37.870 --> 02:40.150
- I don't know, Sir.
- Well, take a look.

02:44.190 --> 02:45.980
They look young, Sir?

02:46.030 --> 02:48.420
And every one of them is in my charge

02:48.470 --> 02:50.740
so if you can't cut it as
our medic and part of the team

02:50.790 --> 02:53.220
I have no hesitation in
lobbing you out of the plane.

02:53.270 --> 02:55.470
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Sir.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.180
I love a medic, me.

03:41.230 --> 03:44.020
Cos he's sick in the head...
he'll need you, poppet.

03:44.070 --> 03:46.700
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
darling. I'm Mansfield Mike.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.580
Although I'm not actually from Mansfield.

03:48.630 --> 03:49.780
Yeah, he is!

03:49.830 --> 03:53.110
No, I'm not. I'm from Derby, actually.

03:55.870 --> 03:58.300
Well, if it ain't my 'Friday
night round the back of the Indian

03:58.350 --> 04:00.540
- takeaway in Guildford.'
- Oh, bollocks.

04:00.590 --> 04:04.020
We were bound to meet up again at
some point. That's the army for you.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.400
Is that what you call me, "round
the back of the Indian takeaway"?

04:06.401 --> 04:07.401
Only for shorthand.

04:08.130 --> 04:11.820
I was going to text you back but we
weren't allowed phones at Catterick.

04:11.870 --> 04:13.380
You got something on your chin...

04:13.430 --> 04:16.029
Oh, it's just a bit of bullshit.

04:17.829 --> 04:19.579
I bet you don't remember what they call me.

04:19.630 --> 04:22.460
I do actually, it's in my phone. "Smurf".

04:22.510 --> 04:23.660
Cos you look like one.

04:23.710 --> 04:26.180
No, I don't, I'm bunk up material, me.

04:26.230 --> 04:28.860
Could have had any of your
section that night but I chose you.

04:28.910 --> 04:33.430
Oh, I'm so proud! Listen, don't
say anything to the others, yeah?

04:37.190 --> 04:38.940
You don't want me to tell the lads?

04:38.990 --> 04:42.180
What happened that night was just
a one-off. I was pissed out my nut.

04:42.230 --> 04:43.940
So you don't want me to tell anyone?

04:43.990 --> 04:47.910
You better not. First
impressions and all that.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.300
I dunno if I'm comfortable not
telling my comrades the truth.

04:52.350 --> 04:55.790
Well I'm one of your comrades now
so you'd better not let me down.

04:57.150 --> 04:58.980
I'll just say I was on my phase two,

04:59.030 --> 05:00.700
went to Pirbright for the rugby...

05:00.750 --> 05:02.700
met you and some girls and had a laugh...

05:02.750 --> 05:03.940
Well, that's the truth.

05:03.990 --> 05:05.100
Behind the takeaway.

05:05.150 --> 05:06.500
No, don't you dare!

05:06.550 --> 05:09.260
Hey lads, mate of mine... cockney...

05:09.310 --> 05:11.780
Wahey!

05:11.830 --> 05:15.620
... But all right. Happy?

05:15.670 --> 05:17.510
Ecstatic, you Welsh wanker.

05:19.910 --> 05:21.230
Cheeky.

05:43.630 --> 05:46.300
Right. Hour outside Bastion.

05:46.350 --> 05:49.270
All don your full protective
clothing, including helmets.

06:03.070 --> 06:05.390
Look at that. Oh, my God.

06:07.630 --> 06:11.060
They got a Costa Coffee. They ain't even
got one of them in Basildon have they, Baz?

06:11.110 --> 06:14.340
We got two, as it happens,
because you know what they say?

06:14.390 --> 06:16.460
Baz Vegas is paradise!

06:16.510 --> 06:17.500
They got a Nando's?

06:17.550 --> 06:20.260
They best have a Nando's or I'm
going home. I love Nando's, man.

06:20.310 --> 06:23.100
He wanted to get a Nando's
tattoo when we was on basic!

06:23.150 --> 06:25.150
Don't tell everyone our secrets!

06:26.390 --> 06:29.860
God, look at the size of the sun!
Loads bigger than the English sun.

06:29.910 --> 06:33.630
I'm going to need more than my factor
50 out here, I tell ya that for nothing.

06:57.910 --> 07:00.580
Left, right, left, right, left.

07:00.630 --> 07:04.300
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right,

07:04.350 --> 07:06.500
left, right, left, right, left.

07:06.550 --> 07:09.260
Left, right, left, right.

07:09.310 --> 07:11.910
Section! Halt!

07:14.430 --> 07:15.950
Right turn!

07:17.350 --> 07:20.270
Platoon! Atten-tion!

07:24.550 --> 07:26.540
Welcome to Afghanistan.

07:26.590 --> 07:30.060
You will be here at Camp Bastion
for a few days assimilation.

07:30.110 --> 07:33.260
And then you are to be
deployed on a mission.

07:33.310 --> 07:37.100
You have an excellent captain,
on his fourth tour of Afghanistan.

07:37.150 --> 07:42.190
So you will listen. Follow
his instructions to the letter.

07:44.150 --> 07:50.110
Do well, apply yourselves
and you'll have a good tour.

07:55.510 --> 07:58.150
Bit out of your price range, eh, Mansfield?

08:01.270 --> 08:04.140
I don't know about you mate, but
I booked the presidential suite.

08:04.190 --> 08:06.190
Fellas!

08:09.430 --> 08:12.460
I'll be leading a PT session at 05.30.

08:12.510 --> 08:16.580
Make sure you hydrate tonight
and first thing in the morning.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.940
Any of you helmets not on
top form and giving me 100%

08:19.990 --> 08:23.510
will get my new regulation combat
boot six lace holes up your arses.

08:24.990 --> 08:27.670
Best recruit at Catterick,
one pace forward.

08:32.190 --> 08:35.020
Now, did you pass
geography at school, Dawes?

08:35.070 --> 08:36.419
- No, Sir.
- No.

08:36.470 --> 08:38.820
Did you, Smurf?

08:38.870 --> 08:40.700
Oh, yes, Sir.

08:40.750 --> 08:41.480
Good.

08:42.001 --> 08:45.301
Then you can show our Doris
where the female quarters are.

08:46.950 --> 08:50.270
This is stags only.

08:52.470 --> 08:55.590
Come on, Dawes. Get your stuff together.

09:01.510 --> 09:05.590
- You think I can't manage me own kit?
- Just trying to be nice.

09:06.990 --> 09:08.180
Best recruit at Catterick.

09:08.230 --> 09:11.180
What, the Captain say that to you
every time he talks to you, does he?

09:11.230 --> 09:14.060
He loves me. Everyone loves me.

09:14.110 --> 09:15.380
I'm the life and soul, pal.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.180
Dunno if I can put up with
six months of your bollocks.

09:18.230 --> 09:20.460
Are you really that pissed
off that the captain likes me?

09:20.510 --> 09:22.430
Maybe I don't want that Rupert to like me.

09:23.710 --> 09:25.110
Find your own quarters!

09:26.350 --> 09:28.020
What?

09:28.070 --> 09:30.390
He's a better person than you'll ever be.

09:34.950 --> 09:38.220
Don't worry about Smurf.
Looking for the female quarters?

09:38.270 --> 09:39.390
Come on.

09:47.150 --> 09:51.590
- It's a bit bloody, hot innit?
- You'll get used to it.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.470
Dump your kit. That
bed's free next to mine.

10:02.470 --> 10:08.220
- I'm Molly by the way.
- Jackie. And you've arrived on a killer hot day.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.870
It's like walking through treacle!

10:13.030 --> 10:17.180
- So you know Smurf, then?
- I knew his twin brother.

10:17.230 --> 10:21.100
- He was killed on Herrick 15.
- You're joking.

10:21.150 --> 10:22.710
James was his captain too.

10:24.270 --> 10:26.980
That's why Smurf won't
hear a bad word about him.

10:27.030 --> 10:28.710
I just called him a Rupert.

10:29.990 --> 10:33.020
Smurf's brother Geraint got
shot in the neck on patrol.

10:33.070 --> 10:34.940
James crawled about 200 metres on his belly

10:34.990 --> 10:36.220
to get him and bring him back.

10:36.270 --> 10:38.980
He weren't leaving him as
a trophy for the Taliban.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.220
He'd do the same for you.

10:41.270 --> 10:42.750
Let's hope he don't have to.

10:46.510 --> 10:48.980
We'll get something to eat later.

10:49.030 --> 10:50.020
They got a Nando's?

10:50.070 --> 10:51.620
Pizza Hut any good?

10:51.670 --> 10:53.510
Got to be better than rations, eh?

10:56.110 --> 10:57.900
It'll be worth it, trust me.

10:57.950 --> 11:00.020
- Can't we just phone up for a delivery?
- You can!

11:00.070 --> 11:03.620
Serious. They got this little
bloke that bombs around on a bike.

11:03.670 --> 11:06.230
Be quicker just to grab one now, though.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.740
You don't want to be eating junk food
before a Captain James PT session!

11:12.790 --> 11:14.980
We're off to the healthy tent!

11:15.030 --> 11:17.220
Don't worry about me,
mate. I'll still be running

11:17.270 --> 11:20.350
- while you're breathing out your arse!
- Obsessing about my arse again?

11:22.710 --> 11:24.230
Don't ask.

11:36.270 --> 11:39.047
Six injured. Merts bringing them in now.
All medical personnel report to the hospital.

11:39.048 --> 11:40.378
- Come on.
- Me?

11:40.910 --> 11:42.790
You're medical, aren't you?

11:51.510 --> 11:52.910
Right, let's get him inside.

11:53.950 --> 11:56.390
Molly, get on this stretcher. Molly!

12:14.990 --> 12:17.220
Massive wound to lower
back. I need surgical access,

12:17.270 --> 12:20.950
if you could just let me know when
that's happened. We need blood stat.

12:26.350 --> 12:30.300
- Still losing blood.
- Can we get a pelvic X-ray and a fast scan, please?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.830
We're clear for chest X-ray.

12:35.150 --> 12:38.110
- Come on, guys, focus. We're losing him!
- Sort yourself out.

12:59.910 --> 13:02.350
You all right, Moll?

13:06.390 --> 13:09.060
I really thought my training would kick in.

13:09.110 --> 13:11.790
It will do. Don't worry about it.

13:12.950 --> 13:15.420
Will he make it? The marine.

13:15.470 --> 13:17.630
Got a better chance
here than anywhere else.

13:22.070 --> 13:24.030
The state of him, Jackie.

13:30.470 --> 13:33.180
Get some shut eye.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.740
If only!

13:34.790 --> 13:36.990
It'll be all right.

13:48.470 --> 13:49.670
Private Dawes.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.030
Private Dawes.

14:02.430 --> 14:06.060
Well, I suppose we should be grateful
you're not wearing your stilettos.

14:06.110 --> 14:09.870
- It's full kit, Dawes.
- Yes, Sir.

14:15.510 --> 14:17.630
Left, right, left, right.

14:22.470 --> 14:25.510
- Are we all acclimatizing to the conditions?
- Sir!

14:26.630 --> 14:28.390
Right, we're sprinting the last 50, go!

14:33.470 --> 14:35.270
Smurf, hit the deck now!

14:37.750 --> 14:41.710
Medic, man down! Left leg blown off
below the knee, what you going to do?

14:44.230 --> 14:45.700
Come on, what are you going to do?

14:45.750 --> 14:49.260
You really going to let him bleed out
while you gasp for air like a puffer fish?

14:49.310 --> 14:52.980
Come on, Dawes! This isn't
Call of Duty on the PlayStation.

14:53.030 --> 14:55.470
Someone stands on an IED,
there's a life to save. Get it?

14:58.430 --> 15:01.990
Come on, what are you
going to do? Come on, Dawes!

15:05.110 --> 15:06.390
Smurf, get up.

15:09.830 --> 15:11.420
- Who are we?
- The Under Fives.

15:11.470 --> 15:13.380
- Who are we?!
- The Under Fives!

15:13.430 --> 15:16.350
Now get yourselves
showered, now. Double away!

15:21.550 --> 15:22.900
He could have died just then.

15:22.950 --> 15:25.220
Now, please don't tell me
we've got the only medic

15:25.270 --> 15:26.990
who can't stand the sight of blood.

15:41.910 --> 15:43.630
Relax, lads!

15:45.790 --> 15:50.340
So, we're out of Bastion in the morning and heading
to our special little Forward Operating Base.

15:50.390 --> 15:53.660
This will be home for the immediate.
When we arrive at the village

15:53.710 --> 15:56.539
we will link up with a small
tally of Afghan National Army.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.760
There's a small Taliban
cell destabilising the area.

15:59.850 --> 16:01.865
- Lovely!
- Any questions?

16:01.866 --> 16:02.866
No, Sir.

16:04.910 --> 16:08.750
We need the locals to like us
and, more importantly, to trust us.

16:09.750 --> 16:10.790
Nobody let me down.

16:14.350 --> 16:17.100
Right, our task on the ground is
to support, assist and advise the

16:17.150 --> 16:20.620
Afghan National Army with patrols
around the general area of the fob

16:20.670 --> 16:23.660
and facilitate the local children's
safe passage to their school.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.220
Sound easy?

16:25.270 --> 16:26.670
Lollipop men with guns.

16:27.450 --> 16:29.790
Then get your head out of your arse, Dawes.

16:30.430 --> 16:32.430
There is no such thing as
an easy mission out here.

16:32.550 --> 16:35.489
Right, you'll be flown out in
your sections 0400 hours tomorrow.

16:35.610 --> 16:37.565
So tonight I'll need you
all to have seen the medic.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.500
It's like speed dating, Dawes...

16:40.050 --> 16:42.183
one minute each and then
you sod them off out of it.

16:45.000 --> 16:45.810
Sit up!

16:58.510 --> 17:05.220
Lads. Sort yourselves out.
You're in your own time now.

17:05.470 --> 17:06.900
Ready, Dawes?

17:06.950 --> 17:09.380
Yes, Corporal.

17:09.430 --> 17:10.670
Right. Nude-Nut. In.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.339
What's all that about?

17:19.390 --> 17:23.180
I cut myself shaving and I know how
much you hate the sight of blood.

17:24.270 --> 17:28.820
Do you feel fit? Any injuries at all?

17:28.870 --> 17:31.100
- You can sit down.
- Nah, best not. Fit and well.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.540
Shall I send the next person in?

17:33.590 --> 17:37.020
- Was there nothing...
- Nope. See ya.

17:47.070 --> 17:48.670
Boys giving you a hard time?

17:49.990 --> 17:54.940
I just feel like I keep getting off on the
wrong foot. I keep saying the wrong things.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.950
Have you seen the way that
Captain James looks at me?

17:58.990 --> 18:01.740
We're all trying to prove ourselves.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.910
You'll be fine, I promise you.

18:05.630 --> 18:07.740
I proper froze in that hospital.

18:07.790 --> 18:10.830
You'll be fine.

18:12.590 --> 18:13.750
It takes time and...

18:16.270 --> 18:18.380
Sounds like it was a nasty one.

18:18.430 --> 18:22.710
I'm worried that I won't be able to cut it.

18:24.510 --> 18:30.350
We're all worried we
won't be able to cut it.

18:31.590 --> 18:34.190
Anyone who says they're
not is bullshitting.

18:35.750 --> 18:39.190
Jackie told me about your brother, Geraint.

18:42.630 --> 18:47.590
When the Taliban jackpotted him,
James says he heard a cheer go up.

18:49.470 --> 18:50.700
Sorry, Smurf.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.900
I'm not being... stupid or nothing, Molls

18:53.950 --> 18:57.220
but these people, the Taliban and that...

18:57.270 --> 19:00.510
they're not like us. They're heartless.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.350
You'll be all right, mate.

19:08.270 --> 19:10.220
They laughed as he lost his life out there.

19:10.270 --> 19:13.670
He lost his life for our country, Moll.

19:14.790 --> 19:16.420
Don't want him to have died in vain.

19:16.470 --> 19:18.750
- What does that mean?
- It means...

19:22.030 --> 19:24.790
I'm going to make sure
he didn't die in vain.

19:26.430 --> 19:28.310
You got piles, Smurf?

19:30.030 --> 19:32.350
Then you don't need to sit down, do you?

19:47.350 --> 19:49.030
You all right, fella?

20:02.670 --> 20:07.630
In case any of you were in any
doubt, this is the real deal.

20:11.550 --> 20:15.310
The next six months will
define the rest of our lives.

20:18.710 --> 20:21.870
There will be moments on this
tour that you will never forget.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.430
Both good and bad.

20:29.710 --> 20:31.420
It's not about looking after number one,

20:31.470 --> 20:37.350
it's about looking after
numbers 2 to 12 in your section.

20:39.190 --> 20:42.350
That way you will always have
11 people watching your back.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.700
that is why the British
Army can never lose.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.630
It's what separates us from the enemy.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.150
This mission is about hearts and minds.

20:58.950 --> 21:02.310
We want to leave this place in
a better state than we find it.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.620
Stay focused.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.540
Stay alert.

21:08.590 --> 21:10.510
Stay alive.

21:13.470 --> 21:16.390
The day you are less than 100% focused...

21:17.430 --> 21:19.470
... is the day shit happens.

21:37.310 --> 21:38.630
Hello, you.

21:41.310 --> 21:43.380
Hearts and minds, Dawes?

21:43.430 --> 21:44.670
Bashira?

21:48.750 --> 21:50.300
Bashira?

21:50.350 --> 21:52.540
You don't want to be talking
to the little bleeders.

21:52.590 --> 21:54.020
Eh?

21:54.070 --> 21:56.740
Dickers. Oh, they may look sweet
and that when they're little

21:56.790 --> 21:58.740
but they all grow up with one aim...

21:58.790 --> 21:59.980
to kill us.

22:00.030 --> 22:01.540
I think she was just being friendly.

22:01.590 --> 22:05.910
Straight back to tell some insurgent
everything about us. It's their way.

23:42.430 --> 23:44.030
Water, boys?

23:48.670 --> 23:50.750
Oh, comedy boys.

23:55.670 --> 23:57.780
All right, handsome?

23:57.830 --> 24:00.620
What happened, someone
set fire to your face

24:00.670 --> 24:02.150
and beat it out with a golf shoe?

24:08.390 --> 24:10.670
What you going to do, shoot me?

24:12.350 --> 24:15.100
Oi. Oi.

24:15.150 --> 24:16.420
What is all that about?

24:16.470 --> 24:18.860
That 10 Taliban was giving me the evils.

24:18.910 --> 24:22.550
Behave, will you? He ain't
Taliban, he's one of us.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.510
Right then, boys. First patrol.

24:54.950 --> 24:58.500
All right, lads, all those years of
training... it's about this moment.

24:58.550 --> 25:00.980
Yeah. I hope there's contact.

25:01.030 --> 25:02.820
Come on. Let's be havin' ya.

25:02.870 --> 25:04.550
Before the sun gets his hat on.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.910
Captain Azizi, let's go.

25:17.790 --> 25:20.670
The magazine of 30 rounds. Load!

26:28.230 --> 26:30.510
- Hello, girl.
- Hello, you.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.860
There you go, little one.

26:35.910 --> 26:37.430
You stay?

26:38.430 --> 26:41.550
Pen. Pen. Pen!

26:59.070 --> 27:03.500
- How was that?
- Thought there might be a bit more... action, Sir.

27:03.550 --> 27:06.100
Were they watching us d'you reckon, Sir?

27:06.150 --> 27:10.540
Without a doubt, Baz, after just one
patrol you have become their ace of spades,

27:10.590 --> 27:13.180
the Taliban's most wanted
man after Prince Harry.

27:13.230 --> 27:16.380
My mum always tells me
I look like Prince Harry.

27:20.550 --> 27:22.740
The kids will come up to
you, but don't be distracted.

27:22.790 --> 27:25.790
The ones on the bikes by the trees
to the west could have been dickers.

27:26.990 --> 27:28.270
What are they thinking, Dawes?

27:33.950 --> 27:35.460
That we're at our most vulnerable.

27:35.510 --> 27:37.460
Why?

27:37.510 --> 27:40.630
We're finding our feet,
we don't know the terrain.

27:42.430 --> 27:44.620
Right.

27:44.670 --> 27:49.470
2 Section going out again at
1300. Everyone go get some scoff.

27:58.750 --> 27:59.830
You not hungry, Dawes?

28:00.830 --> 28:02.990
I'm just going to wait for
the ruck to die down, Sir.

28:07.710 --> 28:09.460
Sir...

28:09.510 --> 28:10.540
Spit it out, Dawes.

28:10.590 --> 28:12.660
It's just...

28:12.710 --> 28:17.190
as a medic, I'm a bit worried that
Smurf's in the right frame of mind.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.660
Why's that?

28:20.710 --> 28:23.300
All that with his brother must
have fragged with his head a bit.

28:23.350 --> 28:26.150
He's an excellent soldier.
He knows what he's doing.

28:28.190 --> 28:30.190
It's just that...

28:31.190 --> 28:32.860
Well, he seemed a bit...

28:32.910 --> 28:35.420
I dunno... harsh, let's
say, with an ANA bloke.

28:35.470 --> 28:39.590
It's just a bit of early tour
dick waving. Always happens.

28:42.670 --> 28:45.430
We're on tour!

28:47.030 --> 28:49.020
Looks like you're going
to take off like ET.

28:49.070 --> 28:52.030
Whoa, speaking of which... !

29:33.270 --> 29:35.180
Pen, pen!

29:35.230 --> 29:36.780
Dawesy!

29:36.830 --> 29:38.300
We're all waiting at the gate.

29:38.350 --> 29:39.710
No time to put your face on.

30:07.310 --> 30:11.820
- Can't see your pen-girl.
- I've bought some with, just in case.

30:11.870 --> 30:14.820
They can't even read or write
so God knows why they need pens.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.350
Maybe they want to learn to read and write.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.750
It's mad how much we
take for granted, innit?

30:20.800 --> 30:23.670
You're not gonna start getting
all profound on me are you, Dawesy?

30:24.220 --> 30:27.190
No matter how cute they are when they're
little, they'll still grow up to hate you.

30:27.340 --> 30:29.990
But it doesn't have to be like
that. If we're nice to them, then...

30:30.040 --> 30:31.430
Nice?

30:31.480 --> 30:32.990
Why, what you gonna be?

30:37.560 --> 30:39.830
Contact left! Contact left!

30:39.880 --> 30:41.310
Take cover!

30:41.360 --> 30:42.590
See what I mean, Molls?

30:42.640 --> 30:44.830
Those fuckers have spilt
my family blood out there.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.390
Did anyone see where that came from?

30:47.440 --> 30:48.830
I can't see anything.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.950
Two went into the compound wall behind me.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.430
Keep your heads fucking down.

30:52.480 --> 30:55.950
Think it was from the
compound ahead, Corporal.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.990
I ain't got a skin what you're on
about Smurf, I can't see nothing!

30:59.040 --> 31:00.950
You sure?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.030
They are saying they
are targeting the female.

31:03.080 --> 31:07.310
- Well, they've got eyes on us, then, so keep down!
- Come on, then, you mugs, let's have ya!

31:07.360 --> 31:10.190
Contact 200 metres ahead. Four shots.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.510
Single shooter, Sir.

31:11.560 --> 31:12.990
Have you got eyes on him?

31:13.040 --> 31:16.680
No, Sir. Interpreter says
they're targeting the female.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.110
Get back inside, now!

31:20.160 --> 31:24.030
Right, one at a time,
fucking sprint back into base.

31:24.080 --> 31:29.120
Rest of you, eyes on that
far compound. First man, go!

31:32.600 --> 31:35.360
They know there's a female medic here.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.870
Move! Go!

31:37.920 --> 31:40.240
Moving.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.560
- Move.
- Moving.

31:51.640 --> 31:53.960
Dawes, you're next!

31:56.760 --> 31:58.190
I can't do it, Smurf.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.270
- Of course you can.
- They're after me.

32:00.320 --> 32:03.110
Well, they ain't gonna get
you. I'm gonna get them.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.910
They see you come out of this
ditch and the wankers will appear,

32:05.960 --> 32:08.710
at which point I blow their shitty
heads off. Now get up and run!

32:08.760 --> 32:11.150
I can't, Smurf. Just leave without me.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.950
Dawes! What are you pissing about at? Go!

32:14.000 --> 32:16.750
Just sorting the med kit!

32:16.800 --> 32:18.670
You've gotta go, Molly.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.070
They'll shoot me.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.670
No, they won't. I'll shoot them.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.470
I need you guys out of this ditch now!

32:23.520 --> 32:25.750
Contact ahead! I see the tosser!

32:25.800 --> 32:28.350
What the hell are you
doing, Smurf? Get down now!

32:28.400 --> 32:30.800
Get down, Smurf, get down!

32:35.040 --> 32:37.830
Now, Molly, now. Fucking run!

32:37.880 --> 32:39.520
Fucking run!

33:00.640 --> 33:02.990
No-one's coming out of there tonight.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.640
Are you sure you saw something?

33:05.920 --> 33:07.240
I didn't see anything.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.990
It was like Call of Duty for a
minute there, boys. Unbelievable!

33:17.560 --> 33:20.190
- I wanna have another go at them, mate!
- Come on!

33:20.240 --> 33:23.298
I haven't seen you run so fast since
Dirty Doreen tried to grope you in Liquid!

33:23.299 --> 33:24.299
Do you see me proper run?

33:24.520 --> 33:26.870
You're only fast cos you run
a mile before you buy a pint!

33:26.920 --> 33:31.430
I am never in my lifetime gonna be able to
work at Foot Locker again, I am telling you now.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.990
Have they got a Foot Locker in Mansfield?

33:34.040 --> 33:35.600
I'm from Derby, man!

33:39.240 --> 33:40.680
What have we just learnt?!

33:44.040 --> 33:45.920
What have we just learnt?!

33:50.870 --> 33:53.060
Every time we step
outside of this compound,

33:53.110 --> 33:55.030
we need to be totally alert.

33:57.310 --> 33:58.750
Medic.

34:12.190 --> 34:14.219
I need you to have a look at my blisters.

34:14.270 --> 34:15.670
Yes, Sir.

34:17.670 --> 34:18.940
What do you reckon?

34:18.989 --> 34:21.260
Well, they stink, Sir,
with all due respect.

34:25.550 --> 34:28.380
His behaviour when he was unloading
his weapon into that compound

34:28.429 --> 34:31.260
was reckless and unprofessional.

34:31.310 --> 34:32.750
Who, Sir?

34:33.790 --> 34:35.830
Well, maybe he was in
the wrong frame of mind.

34:37.630 --> 34:38.830
Sir.

34:40.429 --> 34:42.070
Did you see anyone, Dawes?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.429
He didn't eyeball anyone...

34:48.070 --> 34:49.980
Say there were some
children playing inside.

34:50.030 --> 34:51.469
It doesn't bear thinking about.

34:54.790 --> 34:56.510
Did you see an insurgent, Dawes?

34:57.830 --> 34:59.420
He's a good lad, Sir...

34:59.470 --> 35:01.820
He's got a lot of stuff he's dealing with.

35:01.870 --> 35:04.540
You don't deal with it whilst
you're carrying a lethal weapon.

35:04.590 --> 35:06.310
He's all right.

35:07.550 --> 35:09.590
He just saved my arse in that ditch.

35:19.470 --> 35:21.580
I knew I didn't need new boots.

35:21.630 --> 35:23.700
There was nothing wrong with my old ones.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.020
They'll wear in.

35:25.070 --> 35:27.260
Let me dress your blisters
and you can get back

35:27.310 --> 35:29.230
to running us around the compound.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.460
Let's see how good a medic you are, Dawes.

35:33.510 --> 35:34.910
The nuts, Sir.

35:49.690 --> 35:52.870
Smurf. Word.

36:15.030 --> 36:20.030
- Right, Fingers...
- Yes, Sir.

36:21.870 --> 36:23.430
Give that to Dangleberries.

36:27.110 --> 36:29.220
Dawes, mail. Come on!

36:29.270 --> 36:31.540
She likes a male, Sir.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.590
I was about to say has anyone noticed

36:36.640 --> 36:40.350
there's no grass in Afghan
but I spoke too bloody soon.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.360
Boss man, Major Beck on the net.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.990
Right, Fingers, you take
over. And no arsing around.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.510
I am the only one who is
allowed to arse around?

36:51.560 --> 36:52.840
Sir.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.960
Oh, Baz Vegas...

37:09.640 --> 37:13.510
Smells like lavender, bro,
and it's a man's handwriting...

37:13.560 --> 37:15.830
Is there something you're
not telling us, bro?

37:15.880 --> 37:18.390
It's sump oil, you dick!
And it's my dad's writing!

37:45.440 --> 37:48.630
I know you've told the others that
I'm some sort of dirty old slag.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.950
If the cap fits...

37:51.000 --> 37:54.310
Get out. Get out or I
will seriously kill you.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.190
That is a shit thing to do, Smurf.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.110
Now no-one can even look at me.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.230
You brought it on yourself.

38:00.280 --> 38:04.190
There's only two things I don't
like about you... your face.

38:04.240 --> 38:08.390
- Going to James and stabbing me in the back!
- It weren't like that.

38:08.440 --> 38:12.790
You think I'm mad, out
of control, a liability!

38:12.840 --> 38:15.910
He called me in and he sat me down...

38:15.960 --> 38:18.390
Maybe anything I said was
cos I was worried about you.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.630
And I didn't say anything like that.

38:20.680 --> 38:22.470
But you said something though!

38:22.520 --> 38:24.510
I saved your arse in that ditch out there.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.470
Yeah, I know you did. And now you've
gone and ruined my entire tour.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.080
Fuck you, Smurf.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.840
You already have.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.800
As you were, guys.

39:46.040 --> 39:49.030
Right, listen in. The proposed
ANA check point will be here.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.510
Based in an old compound
that the Russians commandeered

39:51.560 --> 39:54.470
a few decades ago, so we'll
be helping Captain Azizi

39:54.520 --> 39:56.830
and his men give it a
bit of a Kirsty make-over.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.470
Dried river bed below,

39:58.520 --> 40:00.030
and across from the river bed,

40:00.080 --> 40:02.830
we have what intel reliably
inform us is a mine field.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.870
Now they think they're old Russian mines,

40:04.920 --> 40:07.720
but nonetheless still quite
capable of blowing your socks off.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.560
Any questions?

40:34.680 --> 40:36.560
Is everything all right, Dawes?

40:37.760 --> 40:40.510
They're sending me to Coventry, Sir.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.480
That is worse than Helmand!

40:44.960 --> 40:46.510
Why are they doing that?

40:46.560 --> 40:48.280
Cos of what I said to you about Smurf.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.550
I have to get everyone through this tour.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.790
That's my job and nothing else matters.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.310
Yes, Sir.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.590
And therefore I'm grateful to you.

40:58.640 --> 41:03.160
Despite what they say, you did the
right thing to tell me your concerns.

41:04.680 --> 41:08.560
And for what it's worth,
I think I make you right...

41:09.720 --> 41:11.320
I'm a tad worried too.

41:13.520 --> 41:14.920
Thanks, Sir.

41:16.186 --> 41:17.896
Glad to see they're cracking on.

41:17.946 --> 41:20.336
What are they going to do
when we pull out completely?

41:20.386 --> 41:23.496
That's not for us to worry about,
Dawes. We just do what we're told

41:23.546 --> 41:26.296
until we get back on that
plane to Brize Norton.

41:26.346 --> 41:27.816
This whole place is just gonna go...

41:27.866 --> 41:29.386
"BOOM."

41:30.466 --> 41:33.696
I follow my orders and I trust
those higher in the chain of command

41:33.746 --> 41:34.679
to see the bigger picture.

41:34.680 --> 41:36.317
- Really?
- Absolutely.

41:36.706 --> 41:38.976
It's what we have to believe
in and so I believe in it.

41:39.026 --> 41:40.466
I suggest you do the same.

41:43.306 --> 41:46.746
Mine fields to the west
below the river bed! Be aware!

42:40.986 --> 42:44.786
Here you go. What's your name?

42:47.066 --> 42:50.176
- How do you say 'What's your name' in Pashto?
- Staa num tsa dhe.

42:50.226 --> 42:52.416
Staa num tsa... zee.

42:52.466 --> 42:53.787
Have I said it wrong?

42:53.788 --> 42:57.305
- Staa num tsa dhe.
- Staa num tsa dhe.

42:57.386 --> 42:59.786
Zama num Bashira de.

43:01.186 --> 43:03.823
- What's she saying?
- Her name. Bashira.

43:03.824 --> 43:07.306
Bashira. That's a lovely name. I'm Molly.

43:08.786 --> 43:09.946
Moll-y.

43:11.786 --> 43:14.546
- Molly.
- How old are you, Bashira?

43:19.786 --> 43:21.136
Eleven...

43:21.186 --> 43:24.536
Oh, that's the best age. Stay 11 for ever!

43:24.586 --> 43:28.656
Tell her that I've got a sister
who's a similar age in London.

43:31.026 --> 43:35.016
Tell her that she can be my
sister while I'm here if she wants.

44:12.546 --> 44:15.376
Relax, lads. Make sure
you're loaded up on water.

44:15.426 --> 44:19.896
Dehydration's an absolute
bitch out here. Check your piss,

44:19.946 --> 44:22.296
make sure it's not too yellow.

44:22.346 --> 44:24.816
Fingers, I want you to set up a kitchen.

44:24.866 --> 44:27.976
Smurf, you're on latrine
duty, set up an area.

44:28.026 --> 44:30.536
- Sir.
- Well away from my kitchen, please.

44:30.586 --> 44:33.456
And we need a spot to
burn the silver shit bags.

44:33.506 --> 44:35.136
Nude-Nut.

44:35.186 --> 44:37.536
Dawes, I want you to set
up a treatment facility

44:37.586 --> 44:39.936
with an ANA medic. And Captain Azizi?

44:39.986 --> 44:42.786
I'll need you to clear
those kids away, right now.

44:50.546 --> 44:52.616
That little wanker is a dicker.

44:52.666 --> 44:54.336
What are you talking about?

44:54.386 --> 44:56.856
No, go on, say something, I dare you.

44:56.906 --> 44:58.416
All right, I will say something.

44:58.466 --> 45:01.256
That kid is spotting for the
Taliban and reporting back.

45:01.306 --> 45:03.856
- She's just a kid, Smurf. Chill out.
- Yeah.

45:03.906 --> 45:07.826
A kid who goes back and tells
the Taliban exactly where we are.

45:43.466 --> 45:45.306
What are you up to?

45:56.546 --> 45:58.936
I guess I'm lucky the army
weren't called in to make sure

45:58.986 --> 46:01.416
I went to school in East Ham.

46:01.466 --> 46:03.496
What, you didn't go?

46:03.546 --> 46:04.826
Could you tell?

46:06.106 --> 46:08.696
Still, don't need GCSE's out here, do you?

46:08.746 --> 46:10.936
It's a good job I ain't got any, then, Sir.

46:12.906 --> 46:15.506
Man down! Man down!

46:18.426 --> 46:20.176
What's happened?

46:20.226 --> 46:22.696
I dunno, Smurf saw something
and went down the river bed, Sir.

46:22.746 --> 46:25.736
- Across the river bed?!
- Has anyone got eyes on?

46:25.786 --> 46:27.696
200 metres. Half left. Beyond the bridge.

46:27.746 --> 46:29.576
That's Smurf!

46:29.626 --> 46:32.536
It's a bloody mine-field!? What's
he doing in a bloody minefield?

46:32.586 --> 46:35.536
'I've been shot! I'm pumping blood!'

46:35.586 --> 46:37.616
Smurf, what direction was your contact?

46:37.666 --> 46:38.976
'I'm pumping blood!'

46:39.026 --> 46:40.496
He's got the vallon with him, Sir!

46:40.546 --> 46:42.176
He took it down with him, Sir.

46:42.226 --> 46:43.546
He needs a medic!

46:46.666 --> 46:49.496
I can get to him, Sir. I
know my mine clearing drill.

46:49.546 --> 46:50.896
No fucking way! Wait out!

46:50.946 --> 46:52.896
Sir, he's losing blood. I can get to him.

46:52.946 --> 46:54.336
Wait out.

46:54.386 --> 46:56.896
Just cos I'm a female, Sir, I
don't want special treatment.

46:56.946 --> 46:58.136
I'm the medic, I should go.

46:58.186 --> 47:03.026
'I'm pissing blood! I can't stop it!'

47:04.026 --> 47:06.136
Dangleberries, Brains, with me now.

47:06.186 --> 47:08.186
Move. Move. Move!

47:17.626 --> 47:21.696
Eyes out. Let's go fellas, keep eyes on.

47:21.746 --> 47:23.456
Has anyone seen the enemy?

47:23.506 --> 47:24.706
Can't see him!

47:30.507 --> 47:31.085
Molly!

47:32.326 --> 47:33.296
Molly!

47:33.546 --> 47:34.976
Stay calm, Smurf!

47:35.026 --> 47:37.146
Brains! Dangles!

47:46.866 --> 47:50.176
Smurf? Smurf?!

47:50.226 --> 47:52.656
It's pissing out of me!

47:52.706 --> 47:56.096
Smurf, I'm on my way. Talk to me.

47:56.146 --> 47:58.466
Alpha 3.0 Bravo. 9.
Lino. Roger. So far. Over.

47:59.626 --> 48:03.176
Stay calm, Smurf. Where are you hit?

48:03.226 --> 48:07.176
Top of the leg! High! Groin!

48:07.226 --> 48:10.176
Can you get a tourniquet round it?

48:10.226 --> 48:12.296
I can't get it on, it's too high!

48:12.346 --> 48:14.066
Oh, fuck.

48:15.666 --> 48:17.586
- Smurf!?
- You all right, Dawes?

48:19.106 --> 48:20.006
Talk to me, Smurf.

48:20.166 --> 48:22.724
Nude-Nut, Fingers. I want you
covering them as they're moving.

48:22.846 --> 48:24.916
- Yes, Corporal!
- Yes, Corporal!

48:24.966 --> 48:26.138
You're going to need a winch,

48:26.139 --> 48:28.954
there's nowhere to land. I
repeat, there is nowhere to land.

48:29.376 --> 48:31.446
- She ain't gonna make it.
- Yes, she will, Fingers!

48:31.496 --> 48:32.896
We'll make sure of it.

48:34.816 --> 48:36.326
Smurf!?

48:36.376 --> 48:39.936
- 'Come on Smurf, get up!'
- Smurf? Talk to me, Smurf.

48:41.996 --> 48:43.586
Smurf!?

48:43.636 --> 48:45.386
You all right, Dawes?

48:45.436 --> 48:48.346
Have you got eyes on
Smurf? He's gone quiet.

48:48.396 --> 48:50.826
Talk to her, Smurf. Talk to her, Smurf!

48:50.876 --> 48:52.306
Come on, Smurf, you tit!

48:52.356 --> 48:54.556
ETA 30 seconds on the Mert, Sir.

48:57.156 --> 48:58.586
Smurf?!

48:58.636 --> 49:01.186
Smurf? Smurf?

49:01.236 --> 49:03.116
Smurf?!

49:07.036 --> 49:09.426
Dawes, have you got eyes on
Smurf? Speak to me. How is he?

49:18.676 --> 49:20.316
Dawes!

49:22.756 --> 49:24.826
Dawes!

49:24.876 --> 49:26.226
Moll?

49:26.276 --> 49:28.666
Dawes! Dawes?!

49:28.716 --> 49:30.186
Molly?

49:30.236 --> 49:31.986
Can anyone see her?

49:32.036 --> 49:34.826
I've got eyes on. She ain't moving, Sir.

49:34.876 --> 49:37.396
Contact explosion. Wait out.

49:42.396 --> 49:44.676
Dawes?

49:47.476 --> 49:51.956
Dawes, Dawes, are you all right?

49:54.036 --> 49:55.436
Dawes, talk to me!

49:56.796 --> 50:00.026
I'm all right. I'm all right, Sir.

50:00.076 --> 50:02.026
She's all right! She's OK!

50:02.076 --> 50:04.106
Come on, Moll!

50:04.156 --> 50:06.786
- She's all right!
- Yes, Molly!

50:06.836 --> 50:09.146
I can't believe I've still got my legs.

50:09.196 --> 50:11.946
Just you Smurf, come on lad, come on.

50:11.996 --> 50:14.626
Right. Eyes on now,
boys, eyes on. Cover her!

50:14.676 --> 50:16.306
I see her. I see her.

50:16.356 --> 50:17.786
Moll, what's going on?

50:17.836 --> 50:20.596
Smurf? Smurf?

50:22.636 --> 50:25.506
Smurf. Come on, Smurf. Talk to me.

50:25.556 --> 50:28.746
Smurf, come on, talk to
me. I've come to save you.

50:28.796 --> 50:30.466
Come on, Smurf!

50:30.516 --> 50:33.756
Smurf, oi, Smurf!

50:36.636 --> 50:38.477
Stay with me, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

50:38.478 --> 50:40.478
Please, please don't
die on me, you bell end.

50:40.836 --> 50:44.076
- Dawes, how is he?
- Sir, I'm gonna need a helicopter, I'm losing him.

50:45.716 --> 50:47.426
Just stay with me, Smurf. Keep talking.

50:47.476 --> 50:49.436
Keep making noises for me, yeah?

50:55.316 --> 50:57.786
That's it. That's it, Smurf.

51:00.996 --> 51:03.106
Sir, they can't land here,
it's mined to buggery.

51:03.156 --> 51:05.506
They're gonna drop a winch.

51:05.556 --> 51:07.866
Secure him to the winch
and they'll hoist him up.

51:07.916 --> 51:10.346
I'm gonna have to go up with him, Sir.

51:10.396 --> 51:12.746
Absolutely no way. Do you hear me!?

51:12.796 --> 51:15.386
There's a sniper out here
and you'll be a sitting target

51:15.436 --> 51:18.436
dangling on the end of
a fucking rope. NO WAY!

51:19.596 --> 51:21.426
Sir, the tourniquet's not working.

51:21.476 --> 51:24.076
If I take my fist out of his
groin, he's gonna bleed out.

51:25.636 --> 51:27.356
Lucky I got here when I did, eh?

51:29.316 --> 51:31.466
Come on, Smurf.

51:31.516 --> 51:34.986
Dawes, do not go up on that
winch, that is an order.

51:35.036 --> 51:36.716
I can't hear a thing, can you?

51:45.356 --> 51:46.626
Am I gonna die?

51:46.676 --> 51:48.946
No. If you die, they're all
gonna think it's my fault.

51:48.996 --> 51:51.516
That ain't gonna happen, all right, wanker?

51:57.836 --> 51:59.396
Go on, girl!

52:02.036 --> 52:06.386
Dawes, do not go up on that winch!
That is an order. Do you hear me?!

52:06.436 --> 52:09.466
- Dawes?
- I doubt she can hear a thing under that helicopter.

52:09.516 --> 52:12.666
She goes up with him, the
sniper will pop her straightaway.

52:12.716 --> 52:14.426
Sitting ducks, guys.

52:14.476 --> 52:16.586
Dawes, what do you think you are doing?!

52:16.636 --> 52:18.796
Get off that winch now! That is an order!

52:20.796 --> 52:22.196
Dawes?!

52:25.316 --> 52:26.716
Oh, fuck.

52:27.756 --> 52:30.906
Go on, Moll. Yes, Molly!

52:30.956 --> 52:32.556
Yes, Molly!

52:55.716 --> 52:57.346
Dawesy!

52:57.396 --> 52:59.786
What she just did there
was stupid beyond belief!

52:59.836 --> 53:02.436
She disobeyed a command
and put her life in danger.

53:05.476 --> 53:09.276
Fingers, cover them as they're
moving up. Rest of you, eyes on.

53:10.596 --> 53:12.236
It was also fucking awesome.

53:46.036 --> 53:47.796
Told you you'd live.

53:49.676 --> 53:52.386
- Shit.
- What?

53:52.436 --> 53:54.306
I thought it was a dream.

53:54.356 --> 53:55.916
That'll be the morphine.

53:57.716 --> 54:00.466
Smurf, what the hell were you
doing in the middle of a mine field?

54:00.596 --> 54:05.236
I saw someone... I thought
they were planting an IED.

54:07.236 --> 54:09.876
- It was that kid of yours.
- Bashira?

54:11.716 --> 54:13.236
I went to take a look.

54:14.596 --> 54:16.586
I thought there was a
path that was clear...

54:16.636 --> 54:18.306
Yeah, what happened?

54:18.356 --> 54:21.706
I looked along the path
and, right at the other end,

54:21.756 --> 54:24.636
there was this insurgent
pointing a rifle at my head.

54:26.236 --> 54:28.036
Lucky he was a shit shot, then.

54:30.556 --> 54:33.836
Molls. Got transport to take you
to the helipad if you're quick.

54:38.236 --> 54:41.476
Molls, I was a dickhead.

54:42.596 --> 54:45.636
I'm telling you, I've learnt
a big lesson. Come here.

54:52.196 --> 54:56.186
I'm gonna get myself better,
I'm gonna come back to you.

54:56.236 --> 54:58.186
Come back to me?

54:58.236 --> 54:59.836
To the platoon.

55:01.036 --> 55:05.026
I'm gonna make it up to you,
cos I owe you everything.

55:05.076 --> 55:07.116
Yeah, you do, you nut-bar.

55:10.276 --> 55:11.996
I'll never let you down again.

55:13.636 --> 55:15.516
I'll always be there for you.

55:51.956 --> 55:53.316
Sir.

55:54.476 --> 55:57.426
If you think you're going to win
any plaudits for that ridiculous

55:57.476 --> 55:59.586
and foolhardy act, you
are one 100% mistaken.

55:59.636 --> 56:01.876
Yes, Sir. Sorry, Sir.

56:03.236 --> 56:06.786
That's what my commanding officer said to
me when I went to retrieve Smurf's brother.

56:06.836 --> 56:08.146
Sir?

56:08.196 --> 56:13.946
Having said that, did you hear me
tell you not to go up on that winch?

56:13.996 --> 56:15.556
No, Sir.

56:19.596 --> 56:21.076
Then well done, Dawes.

56:22.796 --> 56:24.236
Thank you, Sir.

56:25.716 --> 56:28.786
I'm not what Smurf said I
was. I didn't deserve that...

56:28.836 --> 56:29.986
I know.

56:30.036 --> 56:32.012
I might've slept with a
few people that I regret...

56:32.015 --> 56:35.756
We all have. It's 2014, not 1914.

56:37.811 --> 56:40.761
Don't let a bit of name calling
put you off the task in hand.

56:40.811 --> 56:44.931
You are an excellent medic,
you're proving yourself.

56:59.171 --> 57:02.801
* She's one of the lads,
she's one of the lads *

57:02.851 --> 57:06.321
* Molly Dawesy, she's one of the lads! *

57:08.231 --> 57:10.441
Thanks, you massive cockwombles!

57:23.171 --> 57:25.521
Heavily armed insurgents
are controlling the area

57:25.571 --> 57:27.321
around the mountains and the village.

57:27.371 --> 57:30.641
Who done this to your face,
Bashira? Was it your dad?

57:30.691 --> 57:32.841
Something about her
that smells a bit rotten.

57:32.891 --> 57:34.841
You don't involve yourself
in the lives of locals.

57:34.891 --> 57:38.361
They must not become dependent on
us in any way, do you understand?

57:38.411 --> 57:41.081
You must not go to the mountains tomorrow.

57:41.131 --> 57:43.081
I think she's trying to
warn me about something.

57:43.131 --> 57:45.801
Either they're luring us in or
something else is going to happen.

57:45.851 --> 57:50.001
Remember, stay focused,
stay alert, stay alive.

57:50.051 --> 57:51.451
Down! RPG!

57:55.331 --> 57:56.521
What you doing?!

57:56.571 --> 57:58.801
Dawes! Get down now!
