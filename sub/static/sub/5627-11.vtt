AND IF YOU LIE,
I'LL KNOW.

AND THEIR LIES

09:47.680 --> 09:49.341
BEFORE I KILL THEM.

SHOOT ME IN THE FACE

IN THE CASE

AT THE END OF LAST YEAR.

10:39.370 --> 10:41.895
I DIDN'T LEARN HOW BIG
UNTIL I CAME BACK
FROM SOME TIME OFF.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.737
WHY'D YOU TAKE TIME OFF?

10:43.770 --> 10:45.806

11:02.790 --> 11:04.758

YOU'RE NOT A HUGGER.

HANDS OFF MY GIRL.

BE INTERESTED IN.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.808
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
WHAT I AM INTERESTED IN,

11:32.860 --> 11:34.179

ON THE 4 HITMEN.

STOP.

YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
WHY YOU TOOK TIME OFF.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.292
IT'S NOT RELEVANT.

11:49.340 --> 11:50.500
THAT'S NOT THE GAME.
THE GAME IS

YOU ANSWER EVERY
QUESTION I ASK.

11:53.010 --> 11:54.773

IS IT DIRTY?

11:57.310 --> 11:59.073

NO.

11:59.110 --> 12:00.919
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT
TO YOUR STORY.

12:00.950 --> 12:02.986
OUT OF CURIOSITY,
IS IT ME YOU DON'T
WANT TO TELL

12:03.020 --> 12:05.488

LISTENING IN?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.456
IS THIS REALLY HOW
YOU WANT TO SPEND
YOUR 30 MINUTES?

12:10.490 --> 12:11.855
YES.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.456
NO.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.923
OK, SO YOU WERE SAYING

12:17.970 --> 12:20.188
YOU SHOWED UP FOR WORK
THAT MORNING AND...

12:20.240 --> 12:23.004
WE LEARNED THAT SOMEONE
UNEXPECTED DECIDED TO TALK.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.268
AND WHO WOULD THAT BE?

12:24.310 --> 12:25.937
BRIAN COCHRAN FROM THE NSA.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.109
I'VE PLACED HIM ON
24/7 LOCKDOWN
AT USP TERRE HAUTE.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.802
THE NETWORK HAS PROVEN
THAT THEY CAN KILL
ANYONE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME,

12:30.850 --> 12:32.203
AND NOW THAT THEY'VE
TARGETED GARCIA,

12:32.250 --> 12:34.047
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE ANOTHER LEAD.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.844
COCHRAN USED ONE OF THE HITMEN
TO TARGET DEA SUPERVISOR GRAFF.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.347
BUT WE CAN PRESS HIM
ON THAT TO GET HIM
TO COOPERATE.

12:39.390 --> 12:40.948
WELL, FORTUNATELY
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

12:40.990 --> 12:42.855
HE HAD A BREAKDOWN
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

12:42.890 --> 12:44.426
AND HE WAS ALREADY WILLING
TO MAKE A DEAL.

12:44.460 --> 12:45.882
WE NEED TO GO TALK TO HIM.

12:45.930 --> 12:46.749
GARCIA AND I ALREADY DID.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.199
THIS IS, WE
VIDEO-CONFERENCED WITH HIM.

12:48.230 --> 12:50.118
HE WAS LIMITED IN WHAT
HE COULD TELL US

12:50.170 --> 12:52.092
ABOUT THE HIT PEOPLE.
HE DIDN'T KNOW THEIR NAMES,

12:52.130 --> 12:54.360
BUT HE DID KNOW ALL OF
THEIR AREAS OF EXPERTISE.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.731
HOW SPECIFIC DO THEY GET?

12:55.770 --> 12:59.558
MOST SUCCESSFUL HITMEN
ARE BASICALLY JUST
SWISS ARMY KNIVES OF MURDER.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.498
WELL, TAKE THE O.G. HIT GUY
WHO GOT US INTO THIS MESS,

13:01.540 --> 13:02.609

REMEMBER HIM?

13:02.640 --> 13:06.041
HE WAS A GENIUS AT MAKING
HITS LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.378

WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

13:08.420 --> 13:09.887
TAKE THE GUY THAT'S
STILL OUT THERE

13:09.920 --> 13:12.957
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR SHOOTING POOR MR. GRAFF.

13:12.990 --> 13:15.049
HE'S KNOWN SIMPLY
AS THE SNIPER.

13:15.090 --> 13:18.958
HE CAN MAKE A T-ZONE SHOT
FROM OVER 2,000 METERS.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.932
WHICH MEANS
HE'S EX-MILITARY.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.063
NOT NECESSARILY OURS,
BUT HE'S DEFINITELY
TRAINED.

13:31.110 --> 13:31.838
SO WHO'S NUMBER TWO?

13:31.870 --> 13:33.076
Garcia: THAT WOULD BE
THE CHEMIST.

13:33.110 --> 13:35.237
HE WORKS WITH POISON.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.441
[TOILET FLUSH ES]

13:41.120 --> 13:44.487

THAT DON'T LEAVE A TRACE.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.462
HE SOUNDS DELIGHTFUL.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.330
WHAT ABOUT NUMBER 3?

14:06.370 --> 14:08.179
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
THE BOMBER.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.201
ACCORDING TO COCHRAN,
HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.400
IT'S A CHEMICAL FIRE
IN TIANJIN, CHINA.

14:12.450 --> 14:14.873
APPARENTLY A BUREAUCRAT
DIDN'T PAY HIS BRIBE ON TIME.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.286
YOU KNOW THAT'S
CONSPIRACY THEORY GARBAGE.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.083
BUT WHAT IS CREDIBLE
IS COCHRAN'S INSISTENCE

14:19.120 --> 14:20.417
THAT HE WAS TRAINED
BY MOSSAD.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.348
JACK GARRE'IT'S
FOLLOWING UP ON LEADS.

14:22.390 --> 14:23.652
THAT LEAVES US
WITH NUMBER 4,

14:23.690 --> 14:25.578
THE ONE WITH THE HIGHEST
BODY COUNT OF THEM ALL.

14:25.630 --> 14:26.551
AND WHO'S THAT?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.227
YES.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.592

IMPRESSIVE.

14:31.630 --> 14:34.963

MADE ALL THOSE BRILLIANT
DEDUCT IONS

14:35.000 --> 14:36.297

14:36.340 --> 14:39.138

ON A SILVER PLATTER.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.138
QUICK QUESTION--ARE YOU GUYS
REALLY PROFILERS

14:41.180 --> 14:42.499
OR ARE YOU JUST LUCKY?

14:42.540 --> 14:45.441
BECAUSE THIS,
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY--

14:45.480 --> 14:47.619
[CLEARS THROAT]
IS PROFILING.

14:47.650 --> 14:49.538
THE REASON YOU TOOK TIME
OFF FROM WORK

14:49.580 --> 14:52.048
WAS TO DEAL WITH THE SAME
GIRL WHO BROKE YOUR HEART.

14:52.090 --> 14:53.409

14:53.460 --> 14:54.950

OF A PARENT, THEN.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.462
YES, YOU ARE, I CAN TELL.
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.968
NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE NOT
REALLY WORTH GE'ITING ANGRY AT.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.474
SO YOU FIGURED OUT
WHAT THE 4 OF US DID,
AND THEN WHAT?

15:17.510 --> 15:19.978
WE PROFILED THAT YOU
OPERATED AS SPOKES ON A WHEEL.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.442
SOMEHOW IT HAD TO BE
CENTRALIZED,

15:21.480 --> 15:23.482
HOW YOU GOT JOBS,
WHO PAID YOU.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.488

FOR YOU.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.488

DIDN'T YOU?

15:27.520 --> 15:29.488
GREAT. SO WHO'S THIS
SNOWMAN JAGOFF?

15:29.520 --> 15:30.726
COCHRAN SAYS
HE'S THE I.T. EXPERT.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.227
HE'S THE KEY
TO THE WHOLE NETWORK.

15:32.260 --> 15:35.058
BUT IF HE SET IT UP, HE'S NOT
JUST GONNA TEAR IT DOWN
BECAUSE WE ASK NICELY.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.022
HE WILL BECAUSE HE WAS
KIDNAPPED BY ONE OF
THE HITMEN

15:37.070 --> 15:38.492
AND HELD AGAINST HIS WILL
IN A SAFE HOUSE.

15:38.530 --> 15:40.498
JJ: I WONDER HOW
THAT FEELS.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.598
EVEN IF THEY HAVE HIM
UNDER DURESS,

15:41.640 --> 15:43.631
HE'S STILL GONNA BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.

15:43.670 --> 15:44.967
WE WILL FIND HIM...

15:45.010 --> 15:47.103
WITH THIS.

15:51.580 --> 15:54.048
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
I'M CONFUSED.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE?

15:54.080 --> 15:56.344
WHEN WE ARRESTED COCHRAN,
WE FOUND A FLASH DRIVE,

15:56.380 --> 15:58.587
ONE THAT GAVE US ACCESS
TO A SPECIFIC SHADOW
OF THE DARKNET,

15:58.620 --> 16:00.554
ONE WE DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW EXISTED.

16:00.590 --> 16:05.027
OH, PUT A RING ON IT
BEFORE YOU DECIDE
TO DO THAT.

16:07.630 --> 16:10.599
OH, THAT'S FLASHY.
IT'S CERTAINLY COCKY.

16:10.630 --> 16:12.393
YEAH, IT'S SMART,
BUT IT'S RISKY.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.239
HE'S TAKING SECURITY FLAWS
FROM HIS OWN CODE

16:14.270 --> 16:16.591
AND THEN EXPLOITING THEM
AS ANOTHER LEVEL OF SECURITY.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.609
IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER,
I'D THINK HE WAS HAVING FUN.

16:19.640 --> 16:23.246
HE WOULDN'T DO THIS
IF HIS LIFE DEPENDED
ON IT, UNLESS...

16:23.280 --> 16:24.247
HE'S YOUNG.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.703
YEAH, AND BASED ON THIS,
LIKE HIGH SCHOOL YOUNG.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.243
Reid: GARCIA USED IT
TO FIND THE WEBSITE

16:30.290 --> 16:32.417

FOR ALL OF YOU.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.419

WE HAD GEOGRAPHY,

16:35.460 --> 16:39.658

YOU WERE KEEPING HIM IN.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.032
TWO DAYS, MAYBE.

20:43.070 --> 20:44.958
THEY LIKE BEING
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS,

20:45.010 --> 20:47.274
SO THEY ALWAYS WORK JOBS
SEPARATELY.

20:47.310 --> 20:50.541
AND, UH, THEY RELY ON ME
TO COORDINATE
ALL THEIR ONLINE TRAFFIC.

20:50.580 --> 20:51.808
YEAH.
WHICH I CAN HELP FAKE.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.272
WE HAVE THE FACADE
COVERED ON OUR END,

20:53.320 --> 20:55.914
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE
BACK CHANNEL COMMUNICATIONS

20:55.950 --> 20:57.042
THAT I CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.786
ESPECIALLY THE BOMBER.

20:58.820 --> 20:59.787
WHY HIM?

20:59.820 --> 21:00.912
I DON'T KNOW.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.952
ALL I KNOW IS
WHEN THEY WOULD ROTATE
WATCHING OVER ME,

21:03.990 --> 21:05.423
HE NEVER SHOWED.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.984
I KNOW WHY. HE'S PARANOID.

21:07.030 --> 21:08.691
MOST EXPLOSIVE EXPERTS ARE.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.721
BLOW EVERYTHING UP,
YOU LIVE IN FEAR
THAT YOU'RE NEXT.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.862
WE NEED TO LURE OUT
THE HITWOMAN.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.630
IF WE CAN TAKE HER ALIVE,
SHE'LL LEAD US
TO THE BOMBER.

21:14.670 --> 21:16.797
WE HAVE TO GIVE HER A TARGET
WORTH COMING OUT OF HIDING FOR.

21:16.840 --> 21:17.807
THAT MEANS ME,
DOESN'T IT?

21:17.840 --> 21:19.899
SIR--
NO.

21:19.940 --> 21:20.770
GARCIA,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS

21:20.810 --> 21:22.630
TO LEAVE YOU OUT THERE
EXPOSED LIKE THAT.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.477
YOU HAVE A RECORD
OF ALL THE KILLS
SHE WAS PAID FOR?

21:24.510 --> 21:25.909
I HAVE RECORDS
OF EVERYTHING.

21:25.950 --> 21:28.475
ALL RIGHT. EVEN
A CONTRACT KILLER
CAN HAVE A VICTIMOLOGY,

21:28.520 --> 21:30.818
A PA'ITERN OF WHICH
SHE'S NOT AWARE.
WE NEED TO FIND THAT.

21:30.850 --> 21:33.045
BUT FIRST WE HAD TO GET
THE DATA THAT WE NEEDED
FROM THE SNOWMAN.

21:33.090 --> 21:37.379
FROM THAT WE COULD START
TO BUILD THE PROFILE
THAT WOULD LEAD US TO YOU.

21:37.430 --> 21:40.024
WHEN WE KNEW WHAT
WE WERE LOOKING FOR,
THE PATTERN WAS OBVIOUS.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.927
THESE 3 HITS--THEY WERE
ALL MEN WHO WANTED
TO KILL THEIR WIVES.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.825
THAT'S THE OLDEST
MOTIVATION IN THE BOOK.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.519
WHY ARE THEY SPECIAL?

21:46.570 --> 21:48.765
SHE TOOK THEIR MONEY,
THEN KILLED THE MEN
WHO HIRED HER.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.097
ALL 3 OF THEM
HAD CHILDREN.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.802
MAYBE CHILDREN ARE THE LINE
HITMEN WON'T CROSS?

21:52.840 --> 21:55.638
THE CHEMIST AND THE SNIPER
BOTH PERFORMED JOBS
THAT INVOLVED FAMILIES.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.648
THEORETICALLY,
IF THE PRICE IS HIGH ENOUGH,

21:57.680 --> 21:59.568
A HITMAN SHOULDN'T
HAVE MORALS.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.669
I THINK THESE KILLS
ARE PERSONAL TO HER.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.915
PERSONAL ENOUGH TO RISK
DOUBLE-CROSSING HER CONTRACT.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.918
MAYBE SOMETHING SIMILAR
HAPPENED TO HER.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.508
AND THAT'S HOW WE GET HER
TO COME TO THE TABLE.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.084
I PRETEND TO BE
THAT KIND OF CLIENT.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.826
HOW DO WE KNOW
THAT'S GONNA WORK?

22:10.860 --> 22:12.919
WE DON'T.
IT'S A CALCULATED RISK

22:12.960 --> 22:15.451
BASED ON HER M.O.,
WHICH IS CATEGORICALLY
DIFFERENT THAN THE MEN.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.922
THEY'RE COLD, CLINICAL,
LONG-DISTANCE.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.393
SHE'S UP CLOSE
AND PERSONAL.

22:18.430 --> 22:19.863
SHE KNOWS THAT SHE
HAS TO BE MORE CAREFUL

22:19.900 --> 22:21.834
BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY
WANTS TO KILL HER TARGETS.

22:21.870 --> 22:23.929
I'M GOING TO PRETEND
TO BE A HUSBAND

22:23.970 --> 22:25.835
WHO WANTS HIS
PREGNANT WIFE DEAD.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.838
WELL, I'D WANT TO KILL
YOU IF YOU TOLD ME THAT.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.836
EXACTLY. THEN ALL
WE HAVE TO DO IS SET
THE RIGHT MEETING SPOT.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.541
A BAR OR A RESTAURANT
WE CONTROL

22:31.580 --> 22:33.844
SO THE ODDS ARE BE'ITER
OF US TAKING HER ALIVE.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.541
THAT'S OUR BEST STRATEGY.

22:35.580 --> 22:37.889
BUT THERE IS ONE FLAW.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.649
YOU. YOU'RE THE FLAW.

22:39.690 --> 22:42.579
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
CHILDREN.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.781
I'M THE PERSON ON MY TEAM
WHO'S THE CLOSEST TO YOUR AGE,

22:44.830 --> 22:47.424
AND I KNEW THAT IF I LOST
CONTROL OF THE SITUATION,

22:47.460 --> 22:49.496
YOU'D BE MORE LIKELY
TO NEGOTIATE WITH A PEER.

22:49.530 --> 22:52.067
YOU HAVE ZERO CONTROL
HERE. NONE.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.931
I OUTFLANKED YOU
FROM THE BEGINNING.

22:53.970 --> 22:55.790
SOME OF YOUR MOVES
WERE PRETTY OBVIOUS.

22:55.840 --> 22:56.864
SUCH AS?

22:56.900 --> 22:57.832
SUCH AS SHOWING UP ARMED.

22:57.870 --> 23:00.134
SUCH AS CHANGING THE VENUE
AT THE LAST MOMENT.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.900
I NEEDED A RESTAURANT
FULL OF INNOCENTS
IN CASE THIS WAS A TRAP.

23:02.940 --> 23:05.170
IF YOU REALLY SUSPECT ED
THIS WAS A TRAP,

23:05.210 --> 23:06.677
THEN WHY SHOW UP AT ALL?

23:06.710 --> 23:08.746
EVEN WHEN YOU FIRST
LAID EYES ON ME,

23:08.780 --> 23:11.044
FROM THE BAR, FROM OUTSIDE,
FROM WHEREVER YOU WERE,

23:11.090 --> 23:13.046
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN THROUGH ME

23:13.090 --> 23:15.581
AND KEPT ON MOVING,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.588
YOU COULDN'T.

23:17.630 --> 23:20.053
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
GET TO THE MAN

23:20.090 --> 23:21.591
YOU REALLY WANT TO HURT,

23:21.630 --> 23:25.896
SO YOU NEED TO HURT ANY MAN
WHO REMINDS YOU OF HIM.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.762
THAT'S KIND OF BOILERPLATE
PSYCHOLOGY, ISN'T IT?

23:29.800 --> 23:32.803
I'M JUST ANOTHER GIRL
WITH DADDY ISSUES.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.535
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW MANY KILLERS

23:34.580 --> 23:38.038
DO WHAT THEY DO
BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.514
IF IT'S SO BOILERPLATE,
WHY DON'T WE TEST
THAT THEORY?

23:40.550 --> 23:44.987
HOW HARD DID YOU
LOOK FOR HIM?

23:45.020 --> 23:46.214
VERY HARD.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.218
AND HOW DISAPPOINTED
WERE YOU

23:48.260 --> 23:52.082
WHEN YOU REALIZED
THAT YOU WILL NEVER FIND HIM?

23:53.960 --> 23:55.894
YOU NEEDED SOME OTHER
OUTLET FOR YOUR RAGE,

23:55.930 --> 23:59.696
AND FOR A WHILE THIS WORKED,
BUT IT ALSO TRIPPED YOU UP.

23:59.730 --> 24:02.164
CAN I TELL YOU
A LITTLE SECRET?

24:04.570 --> 24:06.959
EVERYTHING EVENTUALLY
FALLS APART.

24:07.010 --> 24:10.707
THE TRICK IS ACCEPTING

24:10.750 --> 24:12.843
WHEN IT'S OVER.

24:18.750 --> 24:23.483
[STOPWATCH RINGS]

24:24.860 --> 24:26.589
EXCEPT IT AIN'T OVER,
IS IT?

24:26.630 --> 24:30.726
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M JUST GONNA LET YOU
WALK OUT OF HERE?

24:30.770 --> 24:32.590
YOU PROFILED SO MUCH
ABOUT ME,

24:32.630 --> 24:35.758
EXCEPT YOU FORGOT
TO ASK THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.064
WHY WOULD I MAKE YOU
SIT HERE FOR 30 MINUTES?

24:38.110 --> 24:39.168
BECAUSE YOU'RE STALLING.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.905
THEN YOU DON'T
KNOW ME AT ALL.

24:40.940 --> 24:44.273
DID YOU GUYS SHOW UP HERE
WITHOUT AN ESCAPE PLAN?

24:44.310 --> 24:46.949
OR IS THAT WHAT
JUST ANOTHER GIRL
WITH DADDY ISSUES DO?

24:46.980 --> 24:50.211
MAYBE IF YOU HADN'T
FALLEN VICTIM
TO YOUR OWN GENDER BIAS,

24:50.250 --> 24:54.289
AND, YES, ALL MEN
HAVE GENDER BIAS,
EVEN YOU, DR. REID,

24:54.320 --> 24:56.686
YOU WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED
THAT YOUR ENTIRE STRATEGY

24:56.720 --> 24:58.551
WAS BASED ON ONE
FAULTY DETAIL.

24:58.590 --> 24:59.727
CAN YOU SEE IT?

24:59.760 --> 25:01.250
THEY LIKE BEING
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS,

25:01.300 --> 25:03.120
SO THEY ALWAYS WORKED JOBS
SEPARATELY.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.889
YOU'RE NOT HERE ALONE.

25:04.930 --> 25:07.990
AND MY PARTNER?
LESS PARANOID
THAN YOU THINK.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.632
YOU PLANTED A BOMB
IN THE BUILDING.

25:09.670 --> 25:12.104
WE'RE ON THE MOVE.

25:12.140 --> 25:16.031
I DIDN'T. MY JOB WAS
TO KEEP YOUR ENTIRE TEAM
FOCUSED ON US,

25:16.080 --> 25:17.775
SO HE COULD DO
WHAT HE DOES BEST.

25:24.990 --> 25:28.778
JJ: HOTCH, WE'VE GOT
INTERCONNECTED
C-4 CHARGES DOWN HERE.

25:28.820 --> 25:29.582
HOW MANY?

25:29.620 --> 25:30.780
THERE'S 6 CHARGES.
THEY'RE CONNECTED

25:30.830 --> 25:34.288
TO THE CITY'S GAS LINE.
SHE COULD TAKE OUT
THE WHOLE BLOCK.

25:34.330 --> 25:36.127
THERE ARE INNOCENT
PEOPLE HERE.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.664
YES, THERE ARE.
SO LET ME REMIND YOU
WHAT WE'RE PLAYING FOR.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.736
NOT ONLY WILL I
WALK OUT OF HERE,

25:41.770 --> 25:44.739
BUT YOU WILL MAKE SURE
I LEAVE SAFELY.

25:44.770 --> 25:47.978
AND FROM WHERE
I'M SI'ITING...

25:48.010 --> 25:50.069
IT LOOKS LIKE I'VE WON.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.177
YOU NEED TO PAY
ATTENTION TO THIS PART.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.347
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
THE TERMS OF MY VICTORY.

25:59.390 --> 26:02.655
I WANT YOU TO MOVE
ALL OF YOUR BACKUP
AWAY FROM THIS BUILDING.

26:02.690 --> 26:04.726
IF I WALK OUT OF HERE
AND I SEE ONE COP,

26:04.760 --> 26:06.125
I WILL INCINERATE US ALL.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.320
SPENCER--
I CAN'T DO THAT.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.658
IT'S NOT ME. WHAT YOU'RE
ASKING TAKES TIME.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.190
THIS IS TO WHOEVER'S
IN CHARGE.

26:11.230 --> 26:12.868
UNLESS YOU GUYS
WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE

26:12.900 --> 26:15.368
FOR THE BIGGEST
FBI DISASTER SINCE WACO,

26:15.400 --> 26:16.958
YOU WILL BACK OFF NOW.

26:17.970 --> 26:20.905
WATCH THIS.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.901
JJ, SAY AGAIN. THE BOMB
HAS A CELL PHONE TRIGGER?

26:26.950 --> 26:29.145
THAT'S RIGHT. ALL
SHE HAS TO DO IS CALL
THE NUMBER AND BOOM.

26:29.180 --> 26:30.886
NOT FROM HERE, NO.
CAN YOU JAM THE SIGNAL?

26:30.920 --> 26:32.945
THE FAILSAFE
WILL STILL KICK IN.

26:32.990 --> 26:35.151
SAME OUTCOME--
CAN'T MOVE 'EM,
CAN'T SUBMERGE 'EM.

26:35.190 --> 26:37.215
IT'LL TAKE US HOURS
TO GET THE GAS TURNED OFF
ON THE WHOLE BLOCK.

26:37.260 --> 26:40.024
IF WE ALERT ANYONE,
THEN THE PANIC COULD
SET HER AND THE BOMB OFF.

26:40.060 --> 26:42.858
JJ: SWAT'S ON THE RADIO
WITH THE BOMB SQUAD.

26:42.900 --> 26:45.095
THEY SAY OUR ONLY CHANCE
IS TO GET OUR HANDS
ON THAT CELL PHONE.

26:45.130 --> 26:48.236
IF WE SHUT DOWN
THE TRIGGER, WE CAN
REMOVE THE CHARGES.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.396
GO AHEAD, HOTCH.
MORGAN.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.408
DOES SHE HAVE A CELL PHONE
WITH HER?

26:51.440 --> 26:54.079
I DON'T THINK SO.
I DIDN'T SEE HER
PULL ONE OUT.

26:54.110 --> 26:56.078
THE BOMBER WAS SE'ITING
THIS UP WHILE WE WERE
ALL UP HERE.

26:56.110 --> 26:57.668
I THINK HE'S HOLDING
THE STICK.

26:57.710 --> 26:59.246
WE'RE COMBING THE BLOCK.
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE, THOUGH.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.304
WHERE'S LEWIS?

27:00.350 --> 27:02.113
DO NOT OVERREACT.

27:02.150 --> 27:04.084
DO NOT RUSH.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.940
SIMPLY GIVE EVERY PATRON
THEIR CHECK

27:05.990 --> 27:08.959
AND TELL THEM THERE'S BEEN
AN UNFORESEEN PROBLEM
IN THE KITCHEN

27:08.990 --> 27:10.150
THAT CANNOT BE RESOLVED.

27:10.190 --> 27:11.953
THEIR DINNER HAS BEEN PAID FOR

27:11.990 --> 27:14.220
AND THEY SHOULD LEAVE CALMLY

27:14.260 --> 27:16.694
AND AT THEIR EARLIEST
POSSIBLE CONVENIENCE.

27:16.730 --> 27:17.697
GOT IT?

27:17.730 --> 27:18.958
MM-HMM.
YES, MA'AM.

27:19.000 --> 27:19.967
GREAT.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.968
YOU. COME WITH ME.

27:25.140 --> 27:28.132
THAT TABLE THERE,

27:28.180 --> 27:30.307
YOU LEAVE ALONE.

27:37.050 --> 27:39.018
LOOK AT THAT.
THERE THEY GO.

27:39.050 --> 27:39.914
ALL WE WANT TO DO--

27:39.950 --> 27:42.714
MINIMIZE THE COLLATERAL
DAMAGE. I GET IT.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.820
I'M NOT MAD.
IT'LL GIVE ME
THE COVER I NEED

27:45.860 --> 27:48.454
TO SLIP OUT.
I JUST NEED TO KNOW
IT'S CLEAR,

27:48.500 --> 27:50.456
SO DO ME A FAVOR
AND TELL YOUR BOSS

27:50.500 --> 27:53.128
THAT NOBODY LEAVES
UNTIL IT'S SAFE
FOR ME TO.

27:53.170 --> 27:54.831
REID, PERIMETER AGENTS
ARE PULLING BACK.

27:54.870 --> 27:57.839
YOU HAVE TO LET HER GO.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.303
WELL?

27:59.340 --> 28:03.071
REPEAT--ALL AGENTS,
DO NOT ENGAGE OR PURSUE

28:03.110 --> 28:05.101
UNTIL THE BOMB IS DEFUSED.

28:08.150 --> 28:10.448
SPENCER...

28:12.020 --> 28:14.284
YOU CAN LEAVE.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.754
BUT YOU WON'T.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.051
I'M SORRY?

28:22.100 --> 28:23.089
DOUBLE OR NOTHING.
YOU NEED TO SIT BACK DOWN.

28:23.130 --> 28:24.722
REID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:24.770 --> 28:26.192
WOW,
NOW YOU'RE STALLING.

28:26.230 --> 28:28.835
YOU PLAYED YOUR TRUMP CARD,
BUT I HAVE ONE, TOO.

28:28.870 --> 28:31.338
THANKS FOR DINNER.

28:31.370 --> 28:33.201
I HAD FUN.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.970
I FOUND YOUR FATHER.

28:41.450 --> 28:42.747
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

28:42.780 --> 28:45.180
LOOK AT MY FACE.
AM I BLUFFING?

28:45.220 --> 28:47.211
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE HE IS.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.888
BUT YOU NEED TO SIT BACK DOWN

28:48.920 --> 28:50.478
AND LISTEN TO THE REST
OF MY STORY.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.522
NO. TELL ME NOW.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.527
OR I'LL--

28:53.560 --> 28:54.356
DETONATE THE BOMB?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT, CAT,

28:54.400 --> 28:56.527
BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T LEARN
ANYTHING.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.221
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOOD
AT YOUR JOB

28:58.270 --> 28:59.999
BECAUSE YOU THINK THROUGH
EVERY OUTCOME.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.930
WELL, GUESS WHAT--
SO DO I.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.444
ALL RIGHT.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.119
FINISH THE STORY.

29:16.150 --> 29:19.916
TO PREPARE FOR THIS DINNER,
I HAD TO LEARN
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU,

29:19.950 --> 29:21.383
STARTING WITH YOUR REAL NAME.

29:21.420 --> 29:24.526
FOSTER CARE RECORDS LOCKED,
LOADED, AND SEARCHABLE.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.380
ACCORDING TO
THE EMAILS SHE SENT ME
SE'ITING UP TONIGHT,

29:26.430 --> 29:30.389
HER NAME IS CAT.
SO LET'S ASSUME
HER NAME IS CATHERINE.

29:30.430 --> 29:31.260
GIVE ME MORE.

29:31.300 --> 29:32.858
SUSPICIOUS DEATH FOR MOM,

29:32.900 --> 29:35.266
AND HER DAD MOST LIKELY
WENT AWAY FOR MANSLAUGHTER.

29:35.300 --> 29:36.267
KEEP IT COMING.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.130
RAMPANT ABUSE.

29:37.170 --> 29:39.161
