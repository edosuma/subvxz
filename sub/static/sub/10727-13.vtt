TV tilted 5.3 degrees
to avoid glare.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.602
Speakers set
to optimal volume...

00:36.604 --> 00:39.505
Couch pillows fluffed
to the peak of fluffiness...

Snacks organized
by the region of origin...

00:42.443 --> 00:46.211
Friday night family movie time!

00:46.213 --> 00:48.647
Professor, where are you?

00:48.649 --> 00:50.215
Just a minute, girls!

00:52.119 --> 00:53.419
Professor, hurry!

00:53.421 --> 00:54.887
You're gonna miss the beginning

00:54.889 --> 00:58.057
of "Space towtruck
and the infinite jumper cables"!

00:58.059 --> 01:01.393
Weeks of waiting...
all leading up to this moment!

01:01.395 --> 01:03.028
The twist ending
is supposed to be

01:03.030 --> 01:06.865
the biggest surprise in
the history of anything <i> ever!</i>

01:06.867 --> 01:09.001
Ready, ready, ready!

01:09.003 --> 01:10.436
Finally.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.205
Oh... she's here!

01:13.207 --> 01:15.274
Who's here?

01:15.276 --> 01:16.975
Hi, everyone!

01:16.977 --> 01:19.111
Oh, you look lovely!

01:19.113 --> 01:22.381
Girls,
this is Dr. Sapna Nehru!

01:22.383 --> 01:24.583
Sorry I'm late, cuddle king.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.584
"Cuddle king"?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.419
Oh, thank you for having me!

01:27.421 --> 01:29.455
Mm, I've heard
so much about you!

01:29.457 --> 01:31.423
I mean, from the professor.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.891
Not just, like, the news.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.360
I mean, I don't believe
everything I hear on TV.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.962
I mean, most things.

01:36.964 --> 01:39.431
But on Tuesday, I saw this
report on iguana fashion shows

01:39.433 --> 01:40.699
and I'm like,
"that's not a thing."

01:40.701 --> 01:42.034
Is that a thing?

01:42.036 --> 01:44.336
So then I went downtown and...
wait, am I still talking?

01:44.338 --> 01:45.404
I'll stop talking.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.939
Isn't she the best?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.376
I asked Sapna to join us
for family movie night.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.679
She's the woman I've been
telling you about!

01:55.082 --> 01:56.815
Whoo! Thanks
for making room, guys!

01:56.817 --> 02:00.185
Personal boundaries
being violated.

02:00.187 --> 02:03.155
At least this cheesy popcorn
is delicious!

02:03.157 --> 02:05.457
Do you guys
have any snacks to spare?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.960
Of course! Want some popcorn?
Huh?!

02:07.962 --> 02:09.695
Hey, my popcorn!

02:09.697 --> 02:12.297
<i>Coming up in just
three agonizing minutes,</i>

02:12.299 --> 02:13.632
<i>you couldn't fathom what happens</i>

02:13.634 --> 02:15.434
<i>to space towtruck this time!</i>

02:15.436 --> 02:17.536
This is gonna be
next level sick!

02:17.538 --> 02:20.572
The most important television
event of our generation.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.642
Nothing's gonna move me from
this spot for the next three...

02:23.644 --> 02:25.477
aagh! A spider!
Kill it!

02:25.479 --> 02:27.646
Kill it, kill it, kill it!

02:27.648 --> 02:29.214
No, no, girls!

02:29.216 --> 02:31.350
Spiders are our friends!

02:31.352 --> 02:33.519
They keep your house safe
from other bugs!

02:33.521 --> 02:36.822
Oh, yes, you do!

02:36.824 --> 02:38.390
Sapna is a biologist

02:38.392 --> 02:40.392
specializing
in arachnid studies!

02:40.394 --> 02:42.327
I study spiders every day!

02:42.329 --> 02:43.829
On purpose?

02:43.831 --> 02:46.532
How would you like to watch the
movie with us, little guy?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.967
Here's a seat up front!

02:48.969 --> 02:50.335
Not even on a coaster?!

02:50.337 --> 02:52.437
Blossom, Sapna is our guest!

02:52.439 --> 02:55.340
Here, you can have the last
piece of cheesy popcorn!

02:55.342 --> 02:57.242
The last piece?

02:57.244 --> 02:59.011
Bubbles,
you're being very selfish.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.914
<i>And now, the moment
you've been waiting for!</i>

03:01.916 --> 03:07.186
<i>"Space towtruck and
the infinite jumper cables!"</i>

03:07.188 --> 03:09.888
Yes! The anticipation
is killing me!

03:09.890 --> 03:12.424
My whole life has been
leading up to this moment!

03:12.426 --> 03:14.326
I read online today
that in the end,

03:14.328 --> 03:16.295
it turns out
the gorblaxian meter maids

03:16.297 --> 03:18.130
were ghosts the whole time!

03:18.132 --> 03:20.098
Can you believe it?!

03:20.100 --> 03:21.400
No!

03:21.402 --> 03:23.502
Are you kidding me?!

03:23.504 --> 03:25.270
Buttercup, please!
We can't see!

03:25.272 --> 03:30.709
Although, I've got everything
I really want to see right here.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.279
Um...
I have to go.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.615
Uh, I'm sorry, I need to, um...

03:36.617 --> 03:38.183
Renew some magazine
subscriptions.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.052
At 8:30 P.M.
on a Friday?

03:40.054 --> 03:41.954
Yeah, gotta beat the rush!
Oof!

03:41.956 --> 03:43.889
Or something like that.
I'll stop talking.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.891
Wait!

03:45.893 --> 03:48.594
What a shame.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.630
Girls, I cannot believe
how rude you were to Sapna!

03:51.632 --> 03:54.132
Us? Was she
raised in a barn...

03:54.134 --> 03:56.201
a barn without coasters?

03:56.203 --> 03:57.836
My popcorn!

03:57.838 --> 04:01.173
Who even likes spiders?!
Answer... crazy people.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.808
That is...

04:02.810 --> 04:05.544
Uh-oh!
Emergency signal, gotta go!

04:05.546 --> 04:07.346
We'll talk about this
when you get home!

04:07.348 --> 04:09.615
And I like spiders!

04:13.587 --> 04:16.622
Girls, time
for some pest control!

04:16.624 --> 04:19.625
Why did it have to be a spider?

04:31.705 --> 04:35.307
Oh, gross, oh, gross, oh, gross!

04:38.178 --> 04:39.344
Hey!

04:39.346 --> 04:41.880
Where'd it go?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.448
How'd it get away?

04:43.450 --> 04:44.816
Is that...

04:44.818 --> 04:46.385
Sapna?

04:46.387 --> 04:48.520
Oh!
Hello, girls!

04:48.522 --> 04:50.289
Funny running into you here...

04:50.291 --> 04:51.556
At the crater.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.858
What are you doing here?

04:52.860 --> 04:54.893
I was just here
to study the big spider...

04:54.895 --> 04:56.428
'cause I study spiders.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.231
Remember how I said I study spiders...
Back at the house?

04:59.233 --> 05:00.832
Uh, yeah.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.302
Well, anyway,
I'm off to buy some...

05:03.304 --> 05:05.304
Discount...
Um...

05:05.306 --> 05:06.505
Bags of meat!

05:06.507 --> 05:09.241
Tell the professor I say hi!

05:09.243 --> 05:10.409
Hmm...

05:10.411 --> 05:11.877
Wait a sec,

05:11.879 --> 05:14.946
that's not the way to the
discount bags of meat store.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.648
I don't trust her.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.351
Girls, maybe we should
give Sapna a chance.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.354
She's clearly making an effort
to get along with us,

05:22.356 --> 05:24.656
and the professor
really likes her!

05:24.658 --> 05:28.260
It's not like she's going to
steal him away from us, right?

05:28.262 --> 05:30.529
Mmm, open up, my prince.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.165
Ahh!

05:33.167 --> 05:35.434
Mmm. So glad we got rid
of those kids, huh?

05:35.436 --> 05:38.170
They were such a burden,
weren't they?

05:44.110 --> 05:46.812
She's gotta go.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.348
"Dear Supna,
it is I, the professor.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.050
I regret to inform you
that I no longer like you."

05:52.052 --> 05:53.185
Let me try!

05:53.187 --> 05:56.188
"I think that you are
a big gross butt,

05:56.190 --> 05:57.823
and you smell
like garbage."

05:57.825 --> 06:00.025
"Sorry to be
such a mean ol' meanbag,"

06:00.027 --> 06:01.927
but, hey, baby,
you kno' the sco'.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.696
"Here is a video of a hamster
riding on a kitten!"

06:04.698 --> 06:07.199
"You will find the official
break up form attached.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.102
Sign it and return it to me
within five business days."

06:10.104 --> 06:11.636
"Good-bye forever!"

06:11.638 --> 06:14.039
Sayonara, sucker!

06:14.041 --> 06:16.441
Perfect!

06:16.443 --> 06:19.778
Oh, Sapna!

06:19.780 --> 06:22.247
Why did you leave me?!

06:23.851 --> 06:26.885
Um, professor, what's wrong?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.988

Miss Nehru,
we have a confession to make.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.205
We wrote that e-mail,
not the professor.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.473
We're sorry.

07:21.475 --> 07:25.110
Please get back together.
Please?

07:25.112 --> 07:27.446
Aw, girls, I know
you wrote that e-mail!

07:27.448 --> 07:29.314
You do?
Yes.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.983
Aside from not sounding anything
like the professor,

07:31.985 --> 07:34.286
he doesn't use
sprinklemist font.

07:35.522 --> 07:38.156
But that's not
why I broke up with him.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.224
It's...

07:39.226 --> 07:40.659
Complicated.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.994
But the professor
really likes you!

You can't go around

Uh, yeah...
I'm fine.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.677
Oh, Sapna,
why didn't you tell me

09:38.679 --> 09:41.179
you turn into
a rampaging monster?

09:41.181 --> 09:44.182
I'm sorry!
I wanted to, it's just...

09:44.184 --> 09:46.885
Most guys freak out when
you turn into a giant spider.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.420
It's kind of like

09:48.422 --> 09:50.255
when the little plastic thingy
at the end of your shoe laces

09:50.257 --> 09:52.924
falls off and you can't get it
back through the shoe hole!

09:52.926 --> 09:55.493
But then, you try and use tape
to fix it, but then the...

09:55.495 --> 09:56.695
shh.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.030
None of that matters now, Sapna.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.099
We can work
all this out togeth...

10:01.101 --> 10:02.033
shh!

10:02.035 --> 10:04.769
No, we can't.
You don't understand.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.471
I was in a lab accident...

10:06.473 --> 10:10.942
And now every time I feel love,
I turn into a spider.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.445
I never wanted
to put you in danger.

10:13.447 --> 10:17.649
Until I can find a way
to cure it, I can't be with you.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.185
I'm sorry.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.087
Sapna, wait.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.189
Professor...

10:26.960 --> 10:29.694
Ugh!
Get a lab, you guys.

10:29.696 --> 10:33.531
No, I'm sorry.
I have to go!

10:33.533 --> 10:35.266
Sapna.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.739
How are you feeling, professor?
