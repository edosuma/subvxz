02:26.855 --> 02:28.255
Randy!

02:29.942 --> 02:31.342
Oh, boy!

02:32.820 --> 02:34.261
Randy!

02:35.072 --> 02:36.847
Come on dammit!

02:37.282 --> 02:38.682
Yo!

02:39.618 --> 02:42.853
Hey, you're missing one
of God's great creations.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.941
The sun's just beginning to peak.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.027
Hubba hubba boy. Let's get with it!

02:50.295 --> 02:51.739
I ain't going to tell you again now.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.239
Get out here!

02:53.382 --> 02:57.244
Look dad, you go out,
go on without me.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.038
I'm going to sleep a while longer.

02:59.138 --> 03:00.914
I want you to get dressed,

03:01.014 --> 03:03.999
and get out here on the double!
Hubba! Hubba!

03:05.060 --> 03:07.294
We got a full day ahead of us.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.422
I been up for an hour already!

03:13.777 --> 03:16.180
So you been up for an hour already.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.846
Hubba. Hubba.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.688
Hey! This water smells funny.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.149
It tastes funny too.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.196
It's probably bad water.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.572
The water's good.

03:33.672 --> 03:34.698
Something wrong with you.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.324
It's just fresh, no chemicals.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.703
Now, will you get the lead out?

03:39.803 --> 03:40.662
Well you never know.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.499
I mean, the way industrial waste
gets thrown around these days.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.084
There's probably some big industry up

03:45.184 --> 03:46.752
there that's just
dumping in this river

03:46.852 --> 03:48.572
and polluting the hell out of it.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.549
You looking for something?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.135
Garbage. Trash.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.514
Dad, why does it always
have to be like this?

04:02.492 --> 04:03.811
Like what son?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.437
You and me.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.190
I mean we can never
agree on anything.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.649
We can never be on the same side.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.613
Load it.

04:18.800 --> 04:24.289
Well boy, there's not a feeling
to beat this in the whole world,

04:24.389 --> 04:27.249
nothing in the whole bloody world.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.714
Look, the sun's almost
up all the way now.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.591
Don't you think we've
missed all the animals?

04:34.691 --> 04:37.261
I swear you got that
pessimism from your mother.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.637
You didn't get it from me.

04:38.737 --> 04:42.307
If you'd lived with me all those years
you'd be a man now instead of a sissy.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.019
Being a man doesn't mean I have
to come out here with a big gun

04:45.120 --> 04:47.733
and shoot little animals that
aren't even a threat to me.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.651
I missed the son of a bitch.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.324
What's the matter son? Scare you?

05:02.511 --> 05:06.497
Now, what was it you were
saying to me about being a man?

05:08.016 --> 05:10.918
Forget it.
Probably wouldn't understand.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.836
Well there's good hunting left.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.299
I'm going to get me some game today,

05:15.399 --> 05:19.134
one way or the other,
I'm going to shoot me something.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.265
Help! Help!

06:46.365 --> 06:47.891
Help!

06:47.991 --> 06:49.516
Help me son!

07:05.550 --> 07:07.577
Should be fun at the lake today, huh?

07:07.677 --> 07:08.954
Yeah. You'll like Greg.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.872
Well, what do you know about him?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.874
He's a friend of Tom's, that's all.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.379
Look at, Tom would not set you
up with a geek, you know?

07:17.479 --> 07:19.881
This is money in the bank.
I'm serious.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.551
- You think so? Huh?
- I'm not kidding. You'll see.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.552
That's cool Beth, take your time.
That's good.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.263
I mean that's cool.

07:32.411 --> 07:33.979
Hi, Tom. How you doing?

07:34.079 --> 07:35.479
Hi, Tom.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.944
Would you say hello to her please?

07:41.044 --> 07:42.779
Hello. Hello.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.281
Look, you'll be safe with Greg.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.365
I personally guarantee it. Okay?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.244
Let's go.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.377
Off to the mountains.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.332
Huh, it looks like it's closed.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.755
Do you believe this?

08:44.316 --> 08:45.300
Typical.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.052
I've got to go to the ladies room.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.927
I'll go with you.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.848
Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
I'll get the gas.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.892
What is that?

08:54.993 --> 08:56.685
Somebody shot a bobcat.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.813
Gosh, that's horrible.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.292
It's all right.
It's dead now. Go ahead.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.081
There it is.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.581
Great.

09:20.644 --> 09:22.294
Terrific. It's locked.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.421
Why don't you try the men's room?

09:26.691 --> 09:29.009
Great. The story of
my life, you know.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.680
Sandy, don't start laughing.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.181
Cause if you start laughing,
then I'm in trouble.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.184
I'm not laughing.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.810
Sandy!

09:53.218 --> 09:55.036
What the hell are you doing in here?

09:55.136 --> 09:56.455
This is the men's latrine.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.622
Well my girlfriend, she needed it,

09:59.057 --> 10:01.625
and the women's room was...

10:03.061 --> 10:04.670
What's that mean?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.713
Huh?

10:10.944 --> 10:14.513
No chance, no help, no escape.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.226
I can't figure kids out today.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.448
Where the hell is everyone?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.867
Amazing.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.080
Maybe that doesn't matter.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.956
These old pumps don't lock.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.542
Crank that up for me will you?

10:49.149 --> 10:52.551
So, what do you think of Sandy?

10:53.361 --> 10:55.429
Seems like a very nice girl.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.061
So where are they?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.938
Women, in the bathroom, right?

11:03.038 --> 11:04.356
Here they are now.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.565
Are you ready?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.691
Yeah, well we had to
use the men's room.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.862
You know, you guys write really
weird things on bathroom walls.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.197
What are you talking about?

11:12.297 --> 11:16.284
Somebody wrote no chance,
no help, no escape.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.994
Yeah, and there was a
strange man in there too.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.955
- Is he still in there?
- No.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.209
Let's get out of here,
we don't have to pay for the gas.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.084
What do you mean? Wait a minute.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.253
Come on. Let's pay for the gas.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.049
Hey come on, Tom. Huh?

11:31.149 --> 11:32.733
I mean, it's not like it's a
big oil company or something.

11:32.834 --> 11:35.352
- Let's pay them.
- Well, I'm paying.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.684
- Hello?
- Hello?

11:40.784 --> 11:42.476
Anybody home?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.815
What is this?

11:49.918 --> 11:51.236
Let's get out of here, you guys.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.071
This place really
gives me the creeps.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.821
Hey, wait a second.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.032
Baby rats.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.620
Sandy look at...
Oh, gosh, isn't it cute?

12:03.306 --> 12:05.165
I think we better get out of here.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.759
What the hell are you
kids doing in here?

12:18.530 --> 12:19.973
We were looking for you.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.266
We were going to pay for
the gas we took outside.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.394
We took $10, here's $20.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.863
$12.80.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.492
Ain't seen you kids before.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.871
What are you doing around here?

12:42.971 --> 12:44.913
We were just going to the lake.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.918
Oh, I'd stay away from
there if I was you.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.460
How come?

12:52.856 --> 12:55.757
Well, it's hunting season.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.928
There's been more than
one accident over there

13:00.321 --> 13:02.349
with strangers in these parts.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.393
I guess we might get mistaken
for some deer or something.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.936
Look, I'm telling you.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.314
Don't go down to the lake.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.571
Did you shoot all these animals?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.866
Yeah, that's right.
Every one of them.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.408
Why?

13:31.728 --> 13:33.588
You've never been hunting have you?

13:33.688 --> 13:36.174
No, and I don't plan to either.

13:36.274 --> 13:41.011
Oh, it's a good sport,
as long as you follow the rules.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.930
Yeah, well I don't see it as a sport.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.600
I don't think I could
ever kill an animal.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.936
Well it depends on the animal
and who's doing the hunting.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.691
Besides, I never kill for the sport.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.738
I eat what I kill, and the
sport is in the tracking

13:58.838 --> 14:02.365
and the hunting, not in the kill.

14:02.967 --> 14:07.330
Yeah, well that's wonderful, but,
I think we should really be going.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.915
Yeah, yeah let's go.
Come on, come on. Let's go.

14:15.313 --> 14:19.257
I'm telling you kids not to go
down to the lake, please.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.427
It's full of hunters
this time of year now.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.304
I'm warning you.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.807
Okay.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.435
Okay, we won't go to the lake.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.520
We won't go.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.022
All right.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.947
That guy has a real cheerful outlook.

15:09.784 --> 15:13.937
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord.

15:17.041 --> 15:23.905
72 bottles of beer on the wall

15:26.968 --> 15:28.743
All right men, halt.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.662
Check rations and ammo.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.144
We're going to camp here for a while.

15:33.933 --> 15:38.128
Now, I want to talk with you men.

15:38.771 --> 15:43.134
All my life I have wanted
to lead a troop of men

15:43.234 --> 15:46.386
like you into the wilderness.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.973
Today is the day.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.309
I am leading you into the wilderness.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.522
Now, these are hallowed mountains.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.733
A great Indian tribe called the Guapo

15:58.833 --> 16:01.569
lived, hunted,
roamed in these tribes.

16:01.669 --> 16:05.698
They weren't like the Apache or
the Iroquois or the Chippewa.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.449
Did they kill Custer?

16:09.177 --> 16:15.957
No. No. The Guapo were
famous for raising beans.

16:16.100 --> 16:20.795
They were a bean raising tribe.

16:22.941 --> 16:26.511
But being a scout, one is never lost,

16:26.611 --> 16:29.888
because we have our compass and we...

16:31.699 --> 16:38.271
You can see, see by the...

16:39.958 --> 16:43.486
Now this stream,
this goes downstream,

16:43.586 --> 16:46.406
and all streams empty into a lake,

16:46.506 --> 16:51.117
and the lake empties
into the ocean. Doesn't it?

16:51.302 --> 16:52.328
Of course it does.

16:52.428 --> 16:56.374
Now, boys, men,
without leaving this trail,

16:56.474 --> 17:00.253
I want you to pick up
a rock or a branch,

17:00.353 --> 17:03.172
and bring it home to mom and
dad as a memento of our trip.

17:03.272 --> 17:07.759
No rattlesnakes though,
because rattlesnakes carry germs.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.594
All right men. Dismissed.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.094
Hey!

17:52.155 --> 17:53.596
Anybody home?

17:58.578 --> 17:59.978
Anybody home?

18:16.429 --> 18:17.912
Hello there!

18:18.473 --> 18:20.039
Anybody home?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.835
I could use some help.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.754
Anybody in there?

18:28.608 --> 18:33.011
I've got some cub scouts
down the way and...

18:33.654 --> 18:35.807
And my blisters are killing me.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.307
Hello?

18:56.552 --> 18:58.661
Anybody out there?

19:16.614 --> 19:18.097
Anybody there?

19:35.925 --> 19:37.367
Come on now.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.682
Huh? Huh? Huh?

22:48.534 --> 22:49.602
Sensational.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.104
Sensational. The man
says only sensational.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.023
- All right, it's great.
- Great.

22:54.123 --> 22:56.108
Hey, you don't think the guy
at the station was right?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.902
I mean some crazy
hunter's going to...

22:58.002 --> 22:59.528
I'm sure we're safe, Sandy.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.363
We're just going to have
some fun. It will be all right.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.616
Last one in gets stuffed and mounted.

23:07.345 --> 23:08.911
Well, ready?

23:16.604 --> 23:18.755
All right. Come on Sandy, it's great!

23:20.232 --> 23:21.841
All right!

23:50.304 --> 23:51.913
Want to go for a walk?

23:58.187 --> 24:01.090
You know when I was a kid, I could
have fixed this thing very easily.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.800
I used to have a ham radio set,

24:02.900 --> 24:05.177
and I used to sit up all night long
and listen for distress signals.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.679
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.972
Well did you ever hear any?

24:08.072 --> 24:10.474
Yeah, yeah one time I
even sent an ambulance

24:10.574 --> 24:13.060
to an accident and got
my picture in the paper.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.560
Yeah?

24:23.671 --> 24:25.431
Why are you putting your shirt on?

24:27.675 --> 24:29.200
You want me to take it off?

24:29.927 --> 24:31.327
Come here.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.652
You know, it's the silliest thing.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.112
This thing was working
so well yesterday.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.864
I don't like that sound.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.992
It makes me feel lost
and far away from home.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.582
It must be coming from
a long ways away huh?

25:17.892 --> 25:19.375
Yeah.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.171
Well, you think they're
through at the lake?

25:22.271 --> 25:23.005
Yeah.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.590
- Should we get back?
- Yeah.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.090
Okay.

25:43.417 --> 25:44.817
Tom?

25:46.337 --> 25:47.737
Beth?

25:49.798 --> 25:51.282
I wonder where they are?

25:51.842 --> 25:54.577
Well, if I know Tom,
they're in the back of the van.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.003
Tom, hello? We're back.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.631
Beth?

26:05.731 --> 26:07.632
Hey guys we're back. Hey.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.221
We're back. Hello?

26:15.866 --> 26:17.308
They're not there.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.104
Maybe they went for a walk.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.064
I'm getting kind of cold.
How about you?

26:22.164 --> 26:24.106
Yeah, yeah. I'm hungry.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.859
Well, there's food in the van.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.195
All right. Let's get some.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.286
Where the hell are those guys?

26:35.386 --> 26:36.704
How could they do this?

26:36.804 --> 26:38.914
I mean they've been
gone over an hour.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.125
They've got to know we're going to
be worried about them, don't they?

26:41.225 --> 26:43.334
Yeah, well I'm worried.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.503
I mean this is stupid.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.838
I hate it when people
do things like this.

26:48.983 --> 26:50.259
It drives me crazy.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.968
Well, what do you want to do?

26:52.861 --> 26:54.595
Well, look for them I guess.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.224
Let's try this path here.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.808
I'm right behind you.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.234
It goes through here.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.735
Okay.

27:11.505 --> 27:12.905
Watch your step.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.248
Through here I think.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.294
They wouldn't have gone
through here, would they?

27:25.394 --> 27:28.546
Yeah, they did. Look, you can see.
Now come on.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.208
Sandy! Sandy!

28:07.144 --> 28:08.627
Are you all right?

28:09.063 --> 28:10.755
Yeah, I'm okay.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.273
Give me your hand.

28:31.001 --> 28:34.528
Nice and easy. Okay. Okay. Okay.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.948
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.744
We got to get out of here. Tom and
Beth could be in one of these.

28:40.844 --> 28:44.213
- Okay, come on.
- Wait, what's that?

28:45.974 --> 28:49.752
I don't know. Come on,
let's check it out.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.378
Easy, easy.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.431
What do you think?

29:03.450 --> 29:04.850
I don't know.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.328
Water department.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.248
Keys?

30:51.433 --> 30:53.042
Keys! Where are the keys?

31:19.753 --> 31:22.613
It's eating through the windshield.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.339
What's that sound?

31:42.359 --> 31:44.927
Something's trying to get
in through the side door.

31:55.706 --> 31:56.857
Hey here are the keys.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.983
Greg, do something.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.781
Get out of here!

32:03.881 --> 32:05.406
All right. All right.

32:12.514 --> 32:13.914
Come on start!

32:22.024 --> 32:24.133
All right. All right.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.568
What is that?

32:41.668 --> 32:43.148
I don't know. I don't know.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.923
Try the windshield wipers.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.715
Okay.

33:49.486 --> 33:53.806
I'm... I'm going to
find some help. I'm...

33:54.950 --> 33:56.268
Where are we?

33:56.368 --> 33:58.519
Some kind of country bar.

33:59.037 --> 34:02.314
I'm going to go inside and try
and find somebody to help us.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.067
I'm going with you.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.695
No, no. You stay here.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.362
I don't know what's going on.

34:09.172 --> 34:12.533
I'm... I'm going to be right back.
You lock the door.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.451
I'll be right back.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.250
You'll be safe.

34:30.610 --> 34:35.013
Hey, you ever find that
long-lost wife of yours, Leo?

34:37.117 --> 34:39.393
No, but I didn't look
very hard either.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.317
Hi, hi son! Come on in.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.067
Take any seat in the joint.

34:47.460 --> 34:51.071
Our friends are dead.

34:53.550 --> 34:56.702
Well what happened.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.954
They've been murdered.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.500
Well come on in. Sit down.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.168
Take it easy. Relax.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.628
Give the kid a beer Ivy.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.545
No, no. I need help.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.048
I need some help.

35:08.148 --> 35:10.757
My friends, my friends are dead.

35:14.738 --> 35:17.099
Please lady. Call the police.

35:17.199 --> 35:20.434
Now calm down, son. Calm down.

35:20.911 --> 35:24.147
You've got to tell us a little more
before we call in the sheriff.

35:24.247 --> 35:26.733
Please lady come on. Call the police.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.487
All right. I will.
Just start from the start.

35:30.587 --> 35:33.697
Tell me what happened
and I'll call the police.

36:04.621 --> 36:08.942
It was some kind off lying creature.

36:09.042 --> 36:11.194
They hit our van.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.070
They were like...

36:12.170 --> 36:14.114
Hey Sarge, come here.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.406
Just a second fellows.

36:23.265 --> 36:25.791
I just taught this
recruit another lesson.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.502
This round's on Bill.

36:31.731 --> 36:32.674
Yeah, what is it?

36:32.774 --> 36:36.385
Hey Sarge, this guy
here a friend of yours?

36:38.655 --> 36:40.307
No, never seen him before.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.934
Well he says he's seen some
of your flying saucers.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.434
Yeah.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.230
You seen them little critters?

36:48.748 --> 36:50.315
The flying critters.

36:50.417 --> 36:53.151
Yeah, yeah. They attacked our van.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.571
Feisty little things ain't they?

36:56.756 --> 36:59.157
Are you two guys in
cahoots here, Sarge?

37:00.260 --> 37:03.914
Did you pay this guy to come in
here and spread your crazy stories?

37:04.014 --> 37:05.248
Look, I'm warning you!

37:05.348 --> 37:08.043
When they start eating on you,
don't come to me for help.

37:08.143 --> 37:09.961
Cause you ain't getting any.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.379
Come on Sarge. Lighten up.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.134
I told you they were going to attack.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.634
I said so.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.179
It's happening Aggie.
I knew it was going to happen.

37:21.281 --> 37:24.266
I told you. We've got to
prepare for invasion.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.769
Lady please.
I'm telling you the truth.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.315
If you don't believe me,
ask my girl in the van.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.276
What? There's a girl outside
who's seen those critters?

37:33.376 --> 37:34.776
Yeah.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.116
Let's bring her in here.

37:39.216 --> 37:40.700
We're going to go out and get her.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.659
Then you'll believe me. Come on.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.789
Sandy, I've got help!

37:48.516 --> 37:49.916
Sandy!

37:50.602 --> 37:51.795
Sandy.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.295
She in there boy?

37:54.231 --> 37:55.549
Sandy!

37:55.649 --> 37:56.591
Where is she?

37:56.691 --> 37:58.091
I don't know.

38:01.404 --> 38:02.888
Sandy!

38:05.867 --> 38:07.392
They must have captured her.

38:10.914 --> 38:13.150
No soldier. Not at night.

38:13.250 --> 38:14.901
They've got the edge in the dark.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.319
They'll stalk you out
and you won't see them

38:16.419 --> 38:18.487
until they bury
themselves in your guts.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.283
- Look I'm just...
- Don't give me any of your lip.

38:21.383 --> 38:23.994
I'm in command here.
You do as you're told.

38:24.094 --> 38:26.119
Your job is to take orders.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.165
Leave him alone.

38:28.265 --> 38:31.416
Sarge, you are not
in the Army no more.

38:39.985 --> 38:43.178
Don't let him scare you.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.182
He's never hurt nobody before.

38:48.410 --> 38:52.814
See, he's, he's suffered a lot, and,

38:52.914 --> 38:56.692
he gets carried away,
forgets where he is.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.696
I'll call the police for you.

38:59.796 --> 39:00.989
Why don't you come on inside?

39:01.089 --> 39:02.157
I mean you can't look
for your girlfriend

39:02.257 --> 39:04.242
out here in the dark
by yourself anyway.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.867
So, come on.

39:06.344 --> 39:13.375
No chance. No help. No escape.

39:23.236 --> 39:24.720
The girl wasn't there.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.640
You sit here son,
and I'll call the police.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.768
Hey Sarge.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.021
Huh?

39:33.121 --> 39:34.940
Everything all right out there?

39:35.040 --> 39:38.526
You know Dave, Dave you
ought to be thanking me,

39:38.626 --> 39:40.153
but you're like every other damn

39:40.253 --> 39:42.656
fool in this country,
always ready to retreat.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.866
That's why we haven't won
a war in over 35 years.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.826
I mean you wouldn't see a warning if
it was staring you right in the face.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.331
Makes perfect sense to me.

39:53.808 --> 39:56.084
They start out here in the country.

39:56.770 --> 39:59.297
They establish a foothold,
and after they got us

39:59.397 --> 40:01.132
they move in on the cities.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.592
That way they've got
a base to fight from.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.268
I'll be damned if they
get me without a fight.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.607
They're not going to get
Sergeant Fred Dobbs easy.

40:20.502 --> 40:22.068
Not this time.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.619
The Sheriff will be
here in a little while.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.871
He's catching a pack of lost
cub scouts from the city.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.750
Aggie, get me another beer,
would you?

40:35.850 --> 40:38.753
Sure, Leo. Why don't you have
another one, and another one.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.879
That way you can get good and drunk.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.800
You won't feel anything when
they start eating you alive.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.301
You know Sarge,
if I didn't know any better,

40:46.444 --> 40:49.306
I'd say you got out of the
service on a section 8.

40:49.406 --> 40:51.181
I got an honorable discharge.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.436
Oh, sure, I had a
little trouble with the

40:54.536 --> 40:57.062
yellow belly chicken brass, but I...

40:58.873 --> 41:03.068
I got out on an honorable discharge
after 26 years of service.

41:13.972 --> 41:17.125
I think this belongs to you.

41:17.225 --> 41:20.377
Sandy. Sandy.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.553
She's going to be all right.

41:30.447 --> 41:34.057
I found her out there in the woods
running like a scared rabbit.

41:37.287 --> 41:41.439
Greg, thank God.
I saw it. It was horrible.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.693
You seen it? You seen the creature?

41:43.793 --> 41:45.487
Yeah, it was huge.

41:45.587 --> 41:47.364
That's how the bodies
got in the shack.

41:47.464 --> 41:49.115
I'm going to get you
kids something to eat.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.867
You need some food in your stomachs.

41:50.967 --> 41:51.951
Thank you.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.370
You guys never been in combat.

41:53.470 --> 41:54.788
You don't know.

41:54.888 --> 41:57.706
I'm telling you, the enemy
is out there right now,

41:58.641 --> 42:00.166
killing people!

42:03.563 --> 42:06.508
You found the shack where
it stores the bodies?

42:06.608 --> 42:09.759
Yeah. They're hanging on hooks.

42:10.653 --> 42:12.178
Like animals.

42:17.785 --> 42:22.731
Oh, damn. Not again.
Don't worry, I'll light the lamps.

42:51.236 --> 42:54.222
This is the first step.
Cut off the electricity.

42:54.322 --> 42:55.722
I've seen it before.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.934
Oh, Fred, knock it off will you?

42:58.034 --> 42:59.060
Attack in the dark.

42:59.160 --> 43:00.728
They'll have the advantage then.

43:00.828 --> 43:03.730
Fred, stop it. Right now.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.567
It's just the power company again.

43:07.877 --> 43:11.488
Yeah? That's just what
they want you to believe.

43:11.965 --> 43:13.365
I know.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.785
Sarge, we've been having
power outs for years.

43:18.221 --> 43:20.288
Yeah, there's nothing
to be scared of.

43:24.394 --> 43:28.046
I may need your help, Joe, with Fred.

43:31.818 --> 43:34.679
What'd you say?
What'd you say about me?

43:34.779 --> 43:38.558
I said the meat in the
freezer is going to

43:38.658 --> 43:41.810
get thawed if the power
don't get turned back on.

43:42.579 --> 43:44.314
Now stop being so jumpy.

43:44.414 --> 43:46.314
You're getting everybody all scared.

43:48.084 --> 43:49.693
Did you hear that?

43:51.629 --> 43:53.029
Yeah.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.994
I figured it would be just like this.

43:59.345 --> 44:03.331
Isolate us and then
take us one at a time.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.968
Look, I know you don't believe
me but I don't give a damn

44:06.069 --> 44:10.205
because I know what I'm saying is true,
and you're too blind to see it.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.718
You think we're the only living
creatures in this universe?

44:14.819 --> 44:18.056
You think with all those stars out there
we're the only things that exist?

44:18.156 --> 44:21.641
Well, I got news for you. We ain't!

44:21.868 --> 44:23.351
We ain't alone!

44:23.494 --> 44:26.147
Supposing we ain't alone,
supposing there's a

44:26.247 --> 44:30.401
whole bunch of aliens
like you say, monsters,

44:30.501 --> 44:32.862
supposing there's a whole
bunch of spaceships

44:32.962 --> 44:35.365
parked in the parking
lot right over the hill.

44:35.465 --> 44:38.324
Supposing it's all true,
like you say, then why in

44:38.885 --> 44:42.830
the hell ain't the CIA,
the FBI and your own Army

44:42.930 --> 44:45.081
done something about it?

44:46.768 --> 44:51.463
Because they never do
nothing about nothing.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.512
Tell me about the shack.

44:59.864 --> 45:01.973
You said the bodies were hanging.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.477
Can you find it again?

45:10.166 --> 45:12.650
Aliens ain't human you know.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.237
They could take human form.

45:16.589 --> 45:19.741
All right Fred. All right,
I ain't listening to no more.

45:20.510 --> 45:22.036
All right, you don't believe me!

45:22.136 --> 45:23.830
So, I'm going to go
out there and find...

45:23.930 --> 45:25.330
Hold it!

45:26.974 --> 45:28.708
You're scaring the women.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.794
Why don't you sit down?

45:34.607 --> 45:36.049
Sandy, what's the matter?

45:36.984 --> 45:40.470
I don't know.
I feel something, a chill.

45:48.413 --> 45:51.439
No! Oh, my God. Oh, no, Ben.

45:51.791 --> 45:56.569
Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, Ben.

45:59.257 --> 46:01.282
He's still breathing.
Call an ambulance.

46:05.304 --> 46:08.706
I didn't mean it. It was a mistake.

46:09.559 --> 46:14.339
I mean, something came over me.

46:14.439 --> 46:17.382
Something possessed me. I didn't...

46:23.322 --> 46:25.598
It's all your fault.

46:26.242 --> 46:29.018
It all started when you come in.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.272
Look mister, I don't know
what you're talking about.

46:31.372 --> 46:35.401
Yeah, that's when it started,
after you came in.

46:35.501 --> 46:37.569
All the lights and the noise.

46:37.879 --> 46:40.156
You've done enough for tonight Sarge.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.739
Give me the gun.

46:44.385 --> 46:48.246
You stay out of this.
You don't know what's going on here.

46:48.723 --> 46:50.643
You don't know what's
in control here.

46:51.517 --> 46:53.001
The gun.

46:54.145 --> 46:56.756
Get out of my way, Taylor.
I'm the only one

46:56.856 --> 46:58.840
who knows what's going on here.

47:00.109 --> 47:01.718
I'm the only one.

47:01.903 --> 47:04.137
I'm the only one who can protect us.

47:19.337 --> 47:20.738
You kids get outside.

47:20.838 --> 47:22.822
Don't let them out of your sight. No!

47:24.884 --> 47:26.451
Keep him in here.

47:27.470 --> 47:28.705
Don't let them go Taylor.

47:28.805 --> 47:31.164
Taylor! Don't let them go.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.375
You'll regret this Taylor!

48:17.353 --> 48:18.878
Come on with me.

48:19.021 --> 48:21.622
We're heading back to town,
to the nearest police station.

48:22.441 --> 48:25.094
Don't argue with me. Come on.

48:25.194 --> 48:27.013
Greg, I don't think we
should go with him.

48:27.113 --> 48:28.513
It's okay.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.936
Now you ain't got
a choice, young lady.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.607
Where's the shack?

48:39.709 --> 48:41.818
Like I said, it's back at the lake.

48:42.211 --> 48:43.988
Our two friends were
hanging on the wall,

48:44.088 --> 48:45.448
with three others, three men.

48:45.548 --> 48:47.198
You're going to take me there.

48:47.425 --> 48:50.286
You're crazy. I don't
want to go back there.

48:50.386 --> 48:51.579
Take it easy, Sandy.

48:51.679 --> 48:54.080
No, I don't want to go back there.
We need the police.

48:54.724 --> 48:56.876
Now before we can convince the police

48:56.976 --> 49:00.755
that we ain't as crazy as Sarge,
this thing is going to kill again.

49:00.855 --> 49:02.505
Now, get in the truck.

49:03.900 --> 49:07.010
He's right. Yeah, he's right.
Come on.

49:35.181 --> 49:37.301
Come on, let's get him
the hell out of here.

49:39.560 --> 49:40.962
He going to be all right?

49:41.062 --> 49:42.712
I don't know. We'll do our best.

49:47.318 --> 49:50.178
Better hope he ain't dead Sarge.

49:51.989 --> 49:58.394
No chance. No help. No escape.

50:02.291 --> 50:06.112
Dobbs! Fred! Sergeant First Class.

50:06.212 --> 50:09.697
Serial number RA18840644.

50:35.282 --> 50:36.933
You two stay here.

51:13.487 --> 51:16.347
Greg, please. I don't
want to go back there.

51:18.075 --> 51:21.269
We don't know who this guy is,
and we don't know what he's going to do.

51:22.496 --> 51:25.144
I saw something in front of that
bar I've never seen before,

51:25.245 --> 51:27.208
and I have no desire to see it again.

51:27.418 --> 51:29.362
Sandy, Tom was my best friend.

51:29.462 --> 51:32.475
Yeah, well Beth was my best friend.
What does that got to do with it?

51:32.715 --> 51:34.617
It means I've got to do something.

51:34.717 --> 51:37.495
Like what? They're both dead.
We can't help them now.

51:37.595 --> 51:42.083
I don't know, by helping Taylor kill

51:42.183 --> 51:44.292
whatever it was that killed them.

51:45.770 --> 51:51.258
Don't give me that macho revenge,
John Wayne stuff, huh?

51:51.358 --> 51:52.758
Then stay.

51:54.070 --> 51:56.387
I'm sorry. I can't.

52:41.283 --> 52:42.683
Look.

52:44.370 --> 52:46.354
Once they almost got me.

52:47.206 --> 52:49.273
One of those creatures did that.

52:50.668 --> 52:52.111
Why didn't you tell someone?

52:52.211 --> 52:53.731
Why didn't you do something?

52:53.921 --> 52:56.614
Yeah, sure. You mean like Sarge?

52:57.133 --> 52:58.743
You saw the way
everybody believed him.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.451
No, I'm not.

53:00.594 --> 53:03.289
I ain't looking to get locked up.

53:03.389 --> 53:05.373
I'm looking to kill me the alien.

53:08.853 --> 53:10.836
If he don't kill me first.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.384
Hold it. Hold it right there.
That's where it is.

53:15.484 --> 53:17.553
Behind those trees.
That's where the shack is.

53:17.653 --> 53:19.053
You sure?

53:19.238 --> 53:20.638
I'm sure.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.747
Are you staying here?

54:40.527 --> 54:41.927
Right there.

54:48.077 --> 54:49.603
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

54:49.703 --> 54:52.663
Hey, be careful there's a hole out
there somewhere Sandy fell in.

54:53.415 --> 54:56.505
Sarge has been digging them all over
the woods trying to catch this thing.

54:57.836 --> 55:00.072
You two wait here, I'm going up.

55:00.172 --> 55:02.575
No, wait a minute. You can't
leave us without any protection.

55:02.675 --> 55:04.275
Why don't you give us the gun?

55:08.472 --> 55:13.709
Hey, I ain't the crazy one. Remember?

56:54.620 --> 56:56.312
It's just like you said.

56:57.081 --> 56:58.522
Can we go now?

56:59.917 --> 57:01.984
You don't know what you found here.

57:05.214 --> 57:07.698
This is where the
hunter keeps his food.

57:10.469 --> 57:12.246
What are you talking about?

57:12.346 --> 57:15.039
We got him right where we want him.

57:16.016 --> 57:18.210
Sooner or later he's got to come back

57:18.310 --> 57:22.589
for the bodies, and we'll be waiting.

57:22.689 --> 57:24.133
Like hell we will.

57:24.233 --> 57:25.592
We're not going to be waiting.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.052
We're not going to stay here.

57:27.152 --> 57:29.970
We're going to leave right now.

57:30.239 --> 57:33.557
I'd think about it if
I was you. It's a...

57:50.551 --> 57:54.038
Take the light and go.
Get out of here. Leave me!

57:54.138 --> 57:55.830
We've got to get out of here.

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.675
Here comes somebody.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:00:59.638
Stop!

01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:07.439
Here comes another one.

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:09.219
Don't worry, I'll stop this one.

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:23.912
It's a cop. All right! Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.924
Thank God you're the police.

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:38.719
Something's chasing us,
some kind of creature.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.514
They're in the woods,
their bodies are in the shack.

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.310
We can take you to the
shack and the bodies,

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:46.603
but there's a man out there.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:48.480
He's still hurt. His name is Taylor.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.606
He's from around here.

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:53.673
Hey look, we're headed the wrong way.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.237
Are we going to town.
What about Taylor?

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:05.454
What about Taylor?

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:50.749
We were just out there, with Taylor.

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:53.253
He's been wounded by the alien.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:56.248
Now we've got to go back and get
him or he's not going to make it.

01:02:56.398 --> 01:02:59.091
You want me to go back
with you, is that right?

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:03.347
Yes, please.
The man is dying out there.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.013
You've got to believe us.

01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:08.016
Believe a POW, are you kidding?

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.269
I'm a Sergeant.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:04.323
What'd you do, kill the kids
and take over their bodies?

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:06.325
What?

01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:08.493
He thinks that we're the aliens.

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:12.831
Well, okay. Okay.
You don't have to tell me now.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.959
I'll find out soon enough.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:20.816
All right. Get out.
Over there. Come on.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:27.948
I'm sure even you
creatures feel pain.

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:34.329
All right, talk.

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:38.583
I've seen experts make people talk.

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:42.879
Real experts, believe me.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.800
Please don't hurt us.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.300
Shut up!

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.845
Go ahead talk.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.848
Sarge, put down the gun,
I'll tell you everything okay?

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.392
I'm not putting down the gun.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.188
You tell me...

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:01.356
tell me about the invasion force.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.528
Okay, okay.
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.154
Where should I start?

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:07.447
At the beginning.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:09.740
Alright, I'll start at the beginning.

01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:17.499
Okay. Your world is divided
into seven regions.

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:24.923
Each region is a part of the
colonization directive,

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:29.843
and each region reaches to the
center of your planet. Your Earth.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.223
Shall I draw it for you?

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:34.931
Yeah.

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:43.565
Your earth, your world is
divided into seven regions.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:48.111
Your America.

01:06:49.965 --> 01:06:53.827
We anticipate the most resistance

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:57.204
here and a few other places.

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:03.877
When's all this going to begin?

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:11.009
The main striking force begins now.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.576
Come on. Show yourself.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:39.246
No use trying to get away!

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.376
I know you're down there.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.293
Just tell me what I want to know.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:16.825
- Which way?
- I don't know.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:32.215
Come on!

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.611
Are you all right?

01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:38.867
What's the matter?

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.575
I sprained my ankle.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:44.328
Come on, we've got to get
out of here. I'll help you. Easy.

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.548
That's it. That's it.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.592
Okay.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:00.804
Look.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:03.181
Come on.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:29.709
You think anybody's home?

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.960
I don't know,
but we're going to find out.

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.488
Hello! Anybody home?

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:00.198
Looks like somebody lives here.

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:02.338
Well, we're not waiting
for an invitation.

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:24.097
Oh, good, another light.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.389
Hello? Anybody home?

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:30.478
Oh, we can use their phone.

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:32.062
Yeah, if they've got one.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.941
This place looks like somebody's
vacation cabin, or something.

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:39.027
We must have broke in the back door.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.700
Hello? Anybody home?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.325
Let's check this out.

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:47.827
Hello?

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.623
Hello?

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:51.708
Greg?

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:53.208
Yeah.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:55.210
Greg, you okay?

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.592
I found the light.

01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:04.844
Look, a phone.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:12.854
It's dead.

01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:14.604
Well, what are we going to do?

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:18.860
Well, no matter what, it's safer
to stay inside than it is outside.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.160
Come on let's check out
the rest of this place.

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:23.947
There's another light.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:29.160
Great, dead phone,
no people, no nothing.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:30.663
Well, I am wet and freezing.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:33.581
- I'm going to check out this closet.
- Okay.

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:47.305
- Oh, great. Dry clothes.
- Terrific.

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:49.723
- I'm going to get dressed. Okay?
- Okay.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:54.145
You know, we can either
hang around here,

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:59.150
or we can wait for somebody to show,
if there's anybody around.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.210
Or we can try and
make it back to town.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:22.172
- Okay, ready.
- Great.

01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:37.187
It's bone dry. Looks like nobody's
been around here for a while.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:44.402
I used to have a music box like this.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:54.245
What's the matter?

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:58.875
Beth, she gave it to me
on my ninth birthday.

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:08.134
I'll never forget it because
she was so excited about it.

01:14:14.534 --> 01:14:16.559
She bought it six months before.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:23.234
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:27.904
It's okay. Go ahead.
Go ahead. It's okay.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:30.825
Come on. Look, look.
Why don't you go down...

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:33.785
We'll go over here and you can
rest for a while, come on.

01:14:42.437 --> 01:14:43.837
All right.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:46.549
Don't worry about a thing.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.769
We won't leave until
first light, all right?

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:51.719
I'll put your clothes by the heater,
they'll be nice and warm.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.013
Try and get some rest, all right?

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:56.599
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:14:56.868 --> 01:14:59.145
Greg, I just thought of something.

01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:01.689
What if this place belongs to Sarge?
We've got to get out of here.

01:15:01.789 --> 01:15:04.317
No, no, no. Now just
lie back. It's okay.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:08.237
We're safer inside here than we
would be outside. No matter what.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.656
Now don't worry about anything.
Have a little faith in me will you?

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:12.156
I'll stand guard.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:14.369
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:18.519
Okay, now you try and get some rest.
I'll put your clothes by the heater.

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:06.127
Ten or twelve cups of you should do.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:17.263
Greg!

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:29.068
- I saw that horrible creature.
- Come on.

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:32.195
It was chasing me. I couldn't run.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.744
I couldn't see it,
and it could see me.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.455
I was trapped in this room.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.376
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just a dream.

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:46.961
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:48.795
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:53.341
The door's open.

01:16:55.236 --> 01:16:56.761
That was no dream.

01:16:57.822 --> 01:17:00.723
- Maybe the cat got back in.
- Yeah, maybe.

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:04.613
What if it's the people
that own this place?

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:06.230
That'd be just great.

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:07.732
I can see us making it
through this whole mess

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:09.899
and then getting shot as a burglar.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:18.491
Look, I'm going to go
check it out. You stay here.

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:21.995
Oh, no, you're not going
to leave me here alone.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.540
Don't argue with me.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.916
Okay, okay. You lead.

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:32.964
- No.
- Yeah, that's what I thought. Come on.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.093
Is anybody there?
We're friends. Hello?

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:40.972
Hello?

01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:07.206
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:08.875
It's okay.

01:18:13.773 --> 01:18:15.573
I think it must have been the wind.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:33.107
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:37.653
I thought I turned this water off.

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:39.991
I don't understand.

01:18:40.091 --> 01:18:42.033
Yeah, yeah, neither do I.

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:46.435
I think we better look around again.

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:21.114
Didn't I turn that light out?

01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:24.158
I don't know. I guess so.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:49.350
Are we getting paranoid or what?

01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:52.019
Come on, you get back to bed.

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:09.580
Now look, I've got a
pot of coffee going.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.039
I'm going to drink it,
I'm going to stay awake.

01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:14.959
Don't worry. I'm going
to get you out of this.

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:33.311
Yeah, that's nice, I like that.
Put your braids down, that'd be nice.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:06.886
Greg!

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:27.782
Greg?

01:21:31.178 --> 01:21:32.620
Are you asleep?

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:30.863
Let's get out of here.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.080
Come on, let's go.

01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:41.333
We can't leave Greg back there.

01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:43.460
Greg's dead honey,
we can't do anything for him.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.588
- We're going to the shack.
- I don't want to go back there.

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:47.840
All right you stay here.
That thing will be right along.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.382
We're talking about him.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.818
Why do we have to
go back to the shack?

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.056
Please tell me. Why do we
have to go back to the shack?

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:57.474
Because we're being hunted.

01:23:57.574 --> 01:23:59.393
That thing is going to follow
us no matter where we go.

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:02.730
Right now the only choice we have
is where we're going to fight.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:05.981
And if we stand here talking,
we're going to lose that choice, too.

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.694
You don't understand. You don't see.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:11.530
That thing ain't fighting
for survival. No siree.

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:15.034
This ain't like the Sarge said,
that this is an invasion. No.

01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:17.620
That alien, he came down
here for the sport.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.080
He wants to get himself a few
trophies, and you know what?

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:24.083
Right now, you and me,
we are the prize game.

01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:27.545
This is crazy.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:31.342
Yeah, I know it's crazy,

01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:34.343
- but I got the advantage on him.
- Huh?

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:36.220
What? What advantage?

01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:41.976
I'm hunting him and he don't know it.

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.645
Come on.

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:48.107
Come on let's go! Come on!

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:19.181
When the alien took off after you,

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:22.048
I doubled back here and rigged
this shack with enough dynamite

01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:25.269
to blow him halfway back
to wherever he came from.

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:31.734
Use the scope. It's by
the door, on the right side.

01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:38.365
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:40.493
Look, let me have the gun.

01:25:41.428 --> 01:25:44.348
What makes you so sure that
the alien's going to come back here?

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:47.209
Because a hunter always
comes back for his game.

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:49.169
He's got his catch stored in there.

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:52.463
All I've got to do
is hit this plunger.

01:25:53.232 --> 01:25:54.632
Yeah.

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:57.968
And boom. Goodbye alien.

01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:02.850
Don't be afraid. It's going
to work all right. Yeah.

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:04.560
- Get you to a doctor?
- Yeah.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.519
Aliens don't need doctors.

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:08.604
Over there.

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:15.946
Come on now, take it easy Sarge.

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:17.948
This is me, Joe Taylor.
Heck, you know me.

01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:19.241
We've been hunting together.

01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:22.826
You can't fool me.
You're not Joe Taylor.

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:25.913
The Joe Taylor I know was a man.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.374
You took over his body.

01:26:29.476 --> 01:26:32.546
I hate to think what you
aliens did to the real Joe Taylor.

01:26:32.646 --> 01:26:36.550
What? This is crazy, man.
You know this guy.

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:38.509
We're human, just like you.

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:43.847
I did know him,
and he was a good friend.

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:49.520
I lost a lot of friends
in this jungle.

01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:52.941
Oh, now listen Sarge,
this ain't no jungle.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:55.734
This is the United States.
You're home.

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:57.945
You've come back home Sarge.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.864
You're not going to convince
me you're Joe Taylor.

01:27:03.302 --> 01:27:04.785
No chance.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:08.205
No help.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.459
No escape.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:54.418
I knew I'd get one of you. I knew it.

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:03.636
You one of the leaders?

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.722
Or just a soldier huh?

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:13.187
I got you. I got you. Yeah.

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:20.903
I knew I'd get you. I got you.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.572
It's going to be all right.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.255
They all laughed at me.

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:45.387
They said I was crazy,
but now they're going to know.

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:47.304
Yes, they're going to know.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:55.254
Keep going. A little closer
to the shack. Keep going.

01:28:55.355 --> 01:28:58.315
- You're going to kill both of them.
- If I have to, yeah.

01:28:58.417 --> 01:29:02.455
I was very worried when you
made me do that to the sheriff,

01:29:03.856 --> 01:29:08.701
but now it's going to be all right.
Yeah, they're going to thank me.

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:15.416
I knew what was going
on around here. I knew.

01:29:59.019 --> 01:30:01.059
The alien's not close
enough to the shack.

01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:04.381
Shoot him.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:08.085
- That's not going to do any good.
- You've got to try.

01:30:31.468 --> 01:30:33.243
I hit him.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:27.714
Pull it.

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:30.801
Let me get it.

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:45.816
It's up to you now.

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:49.611
When I get that alien to the shack,
you push the plunger.

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:59.371
Alien! Alien!

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:05.168
Alien! Come on!

01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:15.180
Hit the plunger.
Come on, push it, Sandy.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:17.139
You've got to push the plunger.

01:32:25.207 --> 01:32:26.815
The wires.

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:30.193
Sandy.

01:33:26.685 --> 01:33:29.586
You think we're the only living
creatures in this universe?

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:33.049
Do you think with all those stars out
there we're the only things that exist?

01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:34.800
Well, I've got news for you.

01:33:35.694 --> 01:33:38.762
We ain't. We ain't alone.
