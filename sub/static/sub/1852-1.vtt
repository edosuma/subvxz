WEBVTT

00:24.192 --> 00:27.529
I got a phone call one day
from the principal.

00:27.696 --> 00:31.533
And he said, "Mrs. Murphy,
I have to call you on this," he goes,

00:31.700 --> 00:33.910
"but Mike's not really in trouble.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.538
I have to tell you because
we gotta report these things."

00:36.705 --> 00:38.039
He says,
"Mike was in a fight."

00:39.916 --> 00:42.669
I know there was a kid in school
at one point when he was younger

00:42.836 --> 00:44.754
that they were bullying,

00:44.921 --> 00:46.715
and he wouldn't put up with it.

00:46.881 --> 00:51.052
Some of these kids
were bullying a child

00:51.219 --> 00:53.012
who was in--

00:53.179 --> 00:54.723
who had learning disabilities.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.683
So they were trying
to stuff him in a locker,

00:56.850 --> 00:58.643
you know,
thinking it was funny.

00:58.810 --> 01:02.230
And Mike came along and,
you know, told them, "Let him go."

01:02.397 --> 01:05.859
A lot of people say things
about people that passed away

01:06.025 --> 01:08.987
and they might
rightfully be glorified,

01:09.154 --> 01:13.491
but anything that has ever been said
about Mike is spot-on true.

01:13.658 --> 01:15.160
The little kid
was really scared.

01:15.326 --> 01:18.163
He was like--
you know, he thanked Mike.

01:18.329 --> 01:21.124
He was Michael the protector.
And that's what he was doing.

01:21.291 --> 01:24.419
When we were lifeguards, we would have
so-called "lifeguard parties."

01:24.586 --> 01:28.131
And, you know, every now and then
someone would get out of control.

01:28.298 --> 01:30.759
And if there was a mismatch
in a fight with someone,

01:30.925 --> 01:34.179
Mike would make sure
that it "evened out," let's say.

01:34.345 --> 01:36.848
And he would, you know,
stand to that guy's guard.

01:37.015 --> 01:38.808
He was always
very protective of people.

01:38.975 --> 01:40.810
He reflected that in his whole life.

01:40.977 --> 01:42.520
It was always
"please" and "thank you"

01:42.687 --> 01:44.564
and the protector image
that he projected.

01:44.731 --> 01:46.274
I said that, you know,

01:46.441 --> 01:49.486
"You treat people
the way you want to be treated."

01:49.652 --> 01:53.406
Which was,
"It's not about me, it's about you."

01:53.573 --> 01:55.950
And he really was a protector.

01:56.117 --> 01:59.329
This one person
made such an impact

01:59.496 --> 02:01.289
on everything, you know.

02:01.456 --> 02:03.500
But he was the protector.

03:23.997 --> 03:26.332
Maureen Murphy:
Well, we moved to Patchogue

03:26.499 --> 03:28.376
when Mike was about two and half.

03:28.543 --> 03:31.504
And, you know, he was little.

03:31.671 --> 03:34.465
And we had a house built.

03:34.632 --> 03:37.552
And his room
was up on the second floor.

03:37.719 --> 03:40.013
And for a little man, I mean,

03:40.179 --> 03:42.515
he couldn't wait
to get his own room.

03:42.682 --> 03:45.935
He went up into that room,
into his first captain's bed,

03:46.102 --> 03:47.770
'cause he wasn't gonna get
the crib, you know,

03:47.937 --> 03:51.274
and he went to bed,
said good night, and that was it.

03:51.441 --> 03:53.526
Never bothered for water or--

03:53.693 --> 03:56.195
he was that kind of a kid. He was
very mature even for a little guy.

03:56.362 --> 03:59.908
Mike wasn't afraid of anything.
He would just go and do it.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.826
And once he got his mind set to it,

04:01.993 --> 04:04.287
he was doing it
and nobody was stopping him.

04:04.454 --> 04:06.122
We took him
into my neighbor's pool.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.957
We didn't have a pool
back then.

04:08.124 --> 04:12.128
And he was like-- loved the water.
He just loved it.

04:12.295 --> 04:16.132
And one day
he just walked over there

04:16.298 --> 04:18.259
and thought he could go in it
and dove in.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.220
And I got in the water,
picked him up.

04:21.387 --> 04:24.474
And, you know, I see this little face
looking at me through the water.

04:24.641 --> 04:26.893
And I picked him up and I put
the towel around him and I said,

04:27.060 --> 04:29.771
"Don't do that. You can't go in there
unless an adult goes in with you."

04:29.938 --> 04:32.273
And as I turned to put the towel,
he dove in again.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.653
So he just was like
a little water bug.

04:36.819 --> 04:39.489
Mike is my cousin.
We grew up together.

04:39.656 --> 04:43.034
He lived five minutes
from my house.

04:43.201 --> 04:45.745
We went to middle school together.
We went to high school together.

04:45.912 --> 04:48.373
And he always had kids to play with.
Even though he was an only child,

04:48.539 --> 04:51.918
he always had, you know,
cousins and friends to play with.

04:52.085 --> 04:55.505
So my back yard was like
the back yard for all the kids.

04:55.672 --> 04:59.175
We were just playing roller hockey
and stuff in his driveway.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.469
And even then

05:01.636 --> 05:04.347
he might not have been even
the best skater at that time,

05:04.514 --> 05:07.976
but he was diving, blocking shots,
poke-checking, in your way.

05:08.142 --> 05:12.480
He was the guy that got
the skinned knee and kept going.

05:12.647 --> 05:14.983
He had a group of friends.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.026
I wouldn't say
that Mike was the guy

05:17.193 --> 05:19.070
that was jumping
from friends to friends.

05:19.237 --> 05:22.156
He had this core group of guys
that were his buddies,

05:22.323 --> 05:25.076
guys that remained his friends
for the rest of his life.

05:25.243 --> 05:26.953
Micheal Mistretta: When we were kids,
we were playing football

05:27.120 --> 05:29.080
across the street
from his mother's house.

05:29.247 --> 05:32.750
I launched a pass to him
and it was so far to the right.

05:32.917 --> 05:36.045
He actually dove and laid out
like it was an ESPN commercial.

05:36.212 --> 05:38.881
He disappeared
into the hedges.

05:39.048 --> 05:41.592
And I remember thinking to myself,
"My God, what happened to Mike?"

05:41.759 --> 05:44.053
He came out.
He was full of blood, mud,

05:44.220 --> 05:46.264
his shirt ripped,
a hole in his pants.

05:46.431 --> 05:50.143
Walked out, he went, "Touchdown!"
and dropped the ball and walked away.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.645
Mike was an only child
for a long time.

05:52.812 --> 05:56.065
And 10 years later
I had John.

05:56.232 --> 05:59.110
And he never said he wanted
a brother or a sister,

05:59.277 --> 06:01.195
but I think he really wanted
a brother.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.906
And I was in the hospital
and I had John.

06:04.073 --> 06:06.534
And that afternoon
Mike comes walking in the hospital,

06:06.701 --> 06:10.246
and it was really cute-- he bounces up
on the side of the bed and he says,

06:10.413 --> 06:12.665
"Mom, you made me
the happiest kid. I have a brother."

06:12.832 --> 06:15.126
Brought tears to my eyes.

06:15.293 --> 06:17.170
John: I remember going
to the games a lot.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.088
And I remember
at the football games,

06:19.255 --> 06:21.215
of course football
being in the fall and the winter,

06:21.382 --> 06:23.926
sitting on the bench,
watching Michael play

06:24.093 --> 06:26.596
and also at the same time
kind of feeling cold,

06:26.763 --> 06:29.182
like, "How much longer do I have
to be here? I'd rather be home,"

06:29.348 --> 06:31.559
you know,
play with toys or something

06:31.726 --> 06:33.728
and, you know,
in the nice, warm weather.

06:33.895 --> 06:37.815
But, I mean, still watching him play.
It was nice to watch him play.

06:37.982 --> 06:41.861
Michael was such a good kid

06:42.028 --> 06:44.322
that he would go with his father

06:44.489 --> 06:46.616
on the slightest errands.

06:46.783 --> 06:50.161
Dan would say, "Let's go
across the street to 7-Eleven,"

06:50.328 --> 06:54.165
and Michael would say, "Okay, Pop."
And off they would go to 7-Eleven.

06:54.332 --> 06:57.877
As a real young boy,
he was always in a good mood,

06:58.044 --> 07:01.964
always happy. And he was--
he was up for everything.

07:02.131 --> 07:04.133
His dogs
Blackie and Charlie--

07:04.300 --> 07:06.719
he would tell you
what was going on with them.

07:06.886 --> 07:10.098
And he'd always be devoted to them,
making sure they had water

07:10.264 --> 07:12.391
and letting them out,
making sure they were okay.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.769
He was a great swimmer.
And they had a pool in the back yard.

07:14.936 --> 07:18.648
And he would do silly dives,

07:18.815 --> 07:20.650
whether it was cannonballs or--

07:20.817 --> 07:22.610
Dan used to do
something called "pencil."

07:22.777 --> 07:24.654
And Mike would do that
because he was--

07:24.821 --> 07:26.781
he loved swimming.
He loved the water.

07:26.948 --> 07:29.117
( woman over speakers )
Michael Murphy.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.494
( children cheering, clapping )

07:33.204 --> 07:35.790
Man: Come on, Michael,
you're the youngest one there.

07:36.791 --> 07:38.793
Woman:
Good.

07:40.753 --> 07:43.506
Where is he?

07:43.673 --> 07:45.383
Daniel Murphy:
It was chaotic and fun.

07:45.550 --> 07:48.177
Typical Michael--
when the girls moved in,

07:48.344 --> 07:51.556
they were-- I mean, they were--
I think Cathy was nine,

07:51.722 --> 07:54.892
Kelly was 11
and Colleen was 12.

07:55.059 --> 07:57.145
My dad passed away
when I was younger.

07:57.311 --> 08:01.107
And Aunt Maureen had taken me
and my sisters

08:01.274 --> 08:03.860
and gave us, you know,
a family and a place to live.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.112
Daniel: Their father
had died of cancer.

08:06.279 --> 08:08.990
Their mother had basically
abandoned them.

08:09.157 --> 08:11.993
And their grandmother
literally wanted

08:12.160 --> 08:14.453
to move them along.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.706
Michael and I laughed

08:16.873 --> 08:19.542
because she was so intent
on getting them out of her house

08:19.709 --> 08:22.670
that she delivered them to us
in the middle of a snowstorm.

08:22.837 --> 08:25.089
Mike gave up his room

08:25.256 --> 08:27.341
and, you know, we became
like brothers and sisters.

08:27.508 --> 08:31.012
Daniel: "Mom, Dad, the girls
have to stay somewhere.

08:31.179 --> 08:34.557
I'll move out of the big room
so they can go in that room."

08:34.724 --> 08:37.184
And always helped me,
you know, study.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.895
If I didn't know something,
he would help me, teach me.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.023
He actually taught me to drive.
( laughing )

08:42.190 --> 08:44.232
Scott Mactavish:
Tell me more about that.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.569
Yeah, my first car was his first car.

08:46.736 --> 08:49.655
And he'd take me to a parking lot

08:49.822 --> 08:53.075
of an abandoned supermarket
or empty supermarket,

08:53.242 --> 08:56.245
and he'd teach me
to go in circles

08:56.412 --> 08:58.581
and then venture out
onto the roads.

08:58.748 --> 09:00.958
( crowd cheering )

09:10.927 --> 09:13.095
- ( whistle tweets )
- Yes! Yes!

09:15.264 --> 09:16.974
Sports was his thing.
He loved it.

09:17.141 --> 09:19.352
He played soccer.
He wasn't wild about soccer,

09:19.518 --> 09:23.522
but he loved baseball.
He loved football and hockey, yeah.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.400
Anything kind of dangerous
he liked.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.861
And so he made the football team.
And Mike in high school

09:29.028 --> 09:31.113
was not the Mike you see
in a SEAL uniform.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.199
Mike was kind of a wiry guy.

09:33.366 --> 09:35.409
He was fierce.
The hardest hitter.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.953
Very small. He was a small guy,
you know.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.455
He didn't weigh all that much.
But he played safety.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.291
And he would just-- he would
knock the crap out of people.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.086
And he was fast too.
He was really fast.

09:45.253 --> 09:49.131
He lost his spot to, actually,
Kristin's boyfriend at the time.

09:49.298 --> 09:52.760
And he actually worked with him
to make him a better football player.

09:52.927 --> 09:55.930
That's who he was, you know.
He knew this guy was taking his spot,

09:56.097 --> 09:57.556
but he was gonna help him
get better.

09:57.723 --> 10:01.435
He stepped aside to let
this freshman come up, and willingly,

10:01.602 --> 10:04.981
and mentored him
that entire season, because he knew

10:05.147 --> 10:07.650
that he would be a better fit
for the team in how he played.

10:07.817 --> 10:09.694
Bogenshutz: After the last game,
which they lost,

10:09.860 --> 10:12.822
the coach came out
and said to the team,

10:12.989 --> 10:14.991
"You know what?
You guys gave up.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.827
Every one of you,
leave your uniforms outside the door.

10:17.994 --> 10:21.247
I don't even want to see you.
Except for Michael Murphy.

10:21.414 --> 10:23.916
You can come in
and you can hand your uniform in,

10:24.083 --> 10:25.960
'cause you're the only guy
that continued

10:26.127 --> 10:28.546
to give 100% out on that field
all day long."

10:34.844 --> 10:37.972
So this is Lake Ronkonkoma.
This is where we worked.

10:38.139 --> 10:40.850
The boys would swim out
across the lake.

10:41.017 --> 10:44.770
They would do it for their workouts.
They would run all the way around.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.523
So the lifeguard stand
was right there

10:47.690 --> 10:50.276
where that white stick is.

10:50.443 --> 10:53.654
In my first year of lifeguard,
he was the beach attendant.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.865
And I didn't know any--
I was at Holtsville Pool.

10:56.032 --> 10:58.200
I didn't know anybody.
You know, I got there.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.328
They walked me in.
They sat me on a bench.

11:00.494 --> 11:03.539
And I hear, "Keenan!"
I'm like, "What? Where is this--?"

11:03.706 --> 11:07.043
He was like, "Yo, it's Murph."
I was like, "Hey, man, what's going on?"

11:07.209 --> 11:08.961
Emmerich: He kind of liked
the gig a little bit,

11:09.128 --> 11:11.047
how everybody was
lifeguards.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.507
And he just from there,
I guess,

11:13.674 --> 11:15.718
what he thought was he just wanted
to become a lifeguard.

11:15.885 --> 11:17.678
And he worked out
and he trained

11:17.845 --> 11:20.056
and the next year
he joined the lifeguarding staff.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.475
And that was my first year.

11:22.641 --> 11:25.144
And we all just became friends
from that point forward.

11:25.311 --> 11:27.730
Jessica was, for Mike--

11:27.897 --> 11:30.691
- we started work here.
- She was quiet.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.902
There was a little quiet girl
working at the beach

11:33.069 --> 11:35.196
who sat down under the shack
reading a book.

11:35.363 --> 11:36.947
Mike starts talking to Jess.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.992
And he's like,
"You're the beach attendant.

11:40.159 --> 11:42.244
You're supposed to clean the bathrooms
and put up the flag."

11:42.411 --> 11:44.330
He's like, "We can't be
having a girl do that."

11:44.497 --> 11:48.084
So then, two minutes, he's got all of us
running down the beach,

11:48.250 --> 11:51.087
the guys cleaning the beach,
dumping the garbages.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.381
- The goose poop.
- Yeah, pick up goose crap.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.674
We're like, "Where did she go?
She's gone."

11:55.841 --> 11:58.511
Like, "We just did this girl's job,
and she's gone."

11:58.677 --> 12:02.306
She comes back.
She's got TCBY.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.392
'Cause I went
to my second job.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.936
We didn't know, 'cause we didn't
take the time to find out,

12:07.103 --> 12:08.771
- Jessica worked for TCBY.
- James: At night.

12:08.938 --> 12:10.940
- At night.
- And that day and many days after

12:11.107 --> 12:13.401
the whole beach won out.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.444
So it was a spoiled crew,

12:15.611 --> 12:17.279
thanks to Mike, you know,

12:17.446 --> 12:19.281
finding that little girl
sitting there reading a book.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.617
- Flower child.
- Yeah, a hippie flower child.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.202
He called her a "tree hugger."

12:23.369 --> 12:25.621
He always wanted to have fun.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.207
And he always wanted
to make people laugh.

12:28.374 --> 12:29.792
And that was his goal,
I felt like.

12:29.959 --> 12:31.752
That's always
what he wanted to do.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.130
I had this minivan that--

12:34.296 --> 12:36.799
it was my dad's family car.
It was our--

12:36.966 --> 12:39.718
we had a GMC Safari
that he passed down to me.

12:39.885 --> 12:42.805
And Mike at one point wanted
to reenact "The A-Team" scenes.

12:42.972 --> 12:45.724
And we would slide the door open
and glide down the road

12:45.891 --> 12:48.352
and he tried to dive in it
while it was moving.

12:48.519 --> 12:50.521
Corey Beach.
And he was so tired.

12:50.688 --> 12:52.982
We had, like, a night
of drinking night before.

12:53.149 --> 12:55.192
- And-- can I say that stuff?
- Yeah.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.027
That's all right?
So we had a night of drinking before,

12:57.194 --> 12:58.612
and he was passed out tired.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.990
Michael liked to party too.
So, you know,

13:01.157 --> 13:03.909
he was not one
to miss out on a party.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.829
So I actually went up on a gazebo,
climbed up on a gazebo,

13:06.996 --> 13:09.623
threw a football at him.
And he was like-- he was so pissed.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.126
He wasn't pissed
pissed, but he--

13:12.293 --> 13:14.336
and he went looking for me.
I was on top of the gazebo.

13:14.503 --> 13:15.838
And he actually found me

13:16.005 --> 13:18.340
and started throwing rocks at me.
And I couldn't get down

13:18.507 --> 13:21.010
unless he started-- you know,
'cause he was pelting me with rocks.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.020
So my parents-- they're both

13:31.187 --> 13:33.939
different in their ways of parenting,
but very much the same.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.358
They were always focused
on my well-being.

13:36.525 --> 13:39.612
So whether or not that was getting me
involved in sports to keep active

13:39.778 --> 13:41.697
or STEP program on Saturdays

13:41.864 --> 13:43.616
to keep my interest
in the sciences fostered.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.659
While other kids were going out
and playing video games

13:45.826 --> 13:48.704
and playing basketball, they always
wanted me to be involved in something,

13:48.871 --> 13:50.080
to have my own identity.

13:50.247 --> 13:54.043
My husband and I have very different
parenting styles.

13:54.210 --> 13:56.670
And as a family, you need that.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.381
You need to have that balance.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.677
I was the disciplinarian.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.472
A lot of it was left up to me,
what I wanted to participate in,

14:06.639 --> 14:08.182
whether it was jujitsu
or Boy Scouts.

14:08.349 --> 14:10.434
But some of it
was some gentle nudging

14:10.601 --> 14:12.520
and letting me know
that I had to do something.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.522
So I still appreciate that.
Now I appreciate that.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.690
As a 13-year-old kid,
knowing that I have to get up

14:16.857 --> 14:19.109
at 8:00 on a Saturday,
that's another story.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.904
I don't care
what you choose to do.

14:22.071 --> 14:23.906
It's your choosing.

14:24.073 --> 14:26.492
We are here as parents
to make sure

14:26.659 --> 14:28.577
that you accomplish that,

14:28.744 --> 14:30.579
to support you on that.

14:30.746 --> 14:33.791
But the only bargaining chip
that we have

14:33.958 --> 14:36.835
is that--
no question about it,

14:37.002 --> 14:39.255
that you have to be
a college graduate.

14:41.799 --> 14:45.302
Craig Palmer:
The first time I ever saw Murph

14:45.469 --> 14:47.763
was day number one
at Penn State.

14:47.930 --> 14:52.393
It was 1994.

14:52.560 --> 14:56.105
And here,
a bunch of young kids,

14:56.272 --> 14:59.441
a mixture of being scared
and as excited as hell to be on your own

14:59.608 --> 15:01.902
and out in a big school
like Penn State.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.363
And I'm moving my stuff
into my dorm room

15:04.530 --> 15:07.491
and I notice this guy
right across the hall.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.702
He seemed like a good guy.
We started speaking.

15:09.868 --> 15:13.747
And, I guess,
30 seconds into the conversation

15:13.914 --> 15:16.292
he mentioned he was
from Patchogue, New York.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.168
And I said,
"You're not gonna believe this.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.296
I'm from a little town
called East Moriches,

15:20.462 --> 15:22.715
you know,
a good 15 minutes away."

15:22.881 --> 15:25.050
And, you know,
the connection was instant.

15:25.217 --> 15:27.469
We formed a bond
that first day that--

15:27.636 --> 15:30.514
I mean, I thank God
that it happened.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.350
He's 10 years older
than his brother John.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.644
So when he went into college
at 18 or 19,

15:35.811 --> 15:37.021
John was eight or nine.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.481
And he used to bring John
up to school with him

15:39.648 --> 15:41.734
for about a week at a time.
And I would say to him,

15:41.900 --> 15:44.486
"Why would you have
an eight-year-old with you?"

15:44.653 --> 15:46.947
And he'd say,
"Because he's a chick magnet."

15:47.114 --> 15:49.533
A lot of the times he was referred to
as Murph and that was--

15:49.700 --> 15:52.286
he even tried to get that to stick
with us as his nickname.

15:52.453 --> 15:55.581
Mike was very superstitious.
It was incredible.

15:55.748 --> 15:58.834
Whenever it came to sport--
not so much in life, but in athletics.

15:59.001 --> 16:02.087
And he would wear
the same shirt

16:02.254 --> 16:04.506
to play football in
without washing it.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.383
That was him.
That's what he would do.

16:06.550 --> 16:10.512
And he would say, "Well, if someone's
gonna have to tackle me,

16:10.679 --> 16:12.681
they're gonna have to
get through the stink."

16:12.848 --> 16:14.266
And so
from that day forward,

16:14.433 --> 16:17.686
he was known as Stinky
among our tight group of friends.

16:17.853 --> 16:19.146
He really did love Penn State.

16:19.313 --> 16:22.066
He had really good friends.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.193
He had his home friends.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.195
And everybody always
kept up with each other.

16:26.362 --> 16:28.530
What more could you ask for?
He was happy.

16:28.697 --> 16:31.700
I wasn't quite sure what his path was
gonna be when he went to Penn State,

16:31.867 --> 16:33.994
but it was something
that was in his heart

16:34.161 --> 16:35.537
and something
that he wanted to pursue.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.247
And, you know,
I was very proud of him.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.501
The kid was smarter
and more well-read

16:40.668 --> 16:42.878
than anyone would ever know,

16:43.045 --> 16:45.547
because it's not something
that he talked about or let on.

16:45.714 --> 16:47.549
He was a prolific reader,
you know.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.219
He read everything
that he could get his hands on.

16:50.386 --> 16:52.888
But on his list of reading material
he said,

16:53.055 --> 16:54.807
"Look, if you want to get me
something for Christmas,

16:54.973 --> 16:56.517
there's this great book
I'd like called

16:56.684 --> 16:58.143
"The Bear On the Other Side
of the Mountain,"

16:58.310 --> 16:59.937
or "The Bear Over the Mountain."

17:00.104 --> 17:04.191
We didn't put any stock--
it kind of-- whew-- over our heads.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.777
Afterwards we find out,
"The Bear Over the Mountain"

17:06.944 --> 17:09.988
was a story about the Russian
invasion into Afghanistan.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.741
And it was almost like a clue
that we didn't pick up.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.660
I thought he was gonna go
to law school, just because.

17:14.827 --> 17:17.287
As far as we knew,
he was always gonna go to law school.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.580
He had all these accolades,
the grades.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.875
His dad's a lawyer.
That's what his dad wanted him to do.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.085
And Mike, he had the grades.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.171
To my knowledge, got into
U Penn Law School, Tennessee Law.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.257
He didn't really,
like, talk about it much.

17:28.424 --> 17:30.217
He started taking it to the next level.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.261
He started training,
just because

17:32.428 --> 17:35.347
he wanted to be in top shape
before he did it.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.683
So clearly he was getting
prepared for something.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.727
The SEALs-- this is crazy,
you know.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.854
It's like the elite of the elite.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.981
And I didn't really, truly believe
that he was gonna do it.

17:44.148 --> 17:46.775
Michael turns to me
and says, "Dad,"

17:46.942 --> 17:49.403
he said, "you know,
we've been talking

17:49.570 --> 17:52.156
about legal education
and stuff,

17:52.322 --> 17:55.868
but I've been looking
at the special operations branch,

17:56.034 --> 17:57.828
specifically the Navy SEALs."

17:57.995 --> 18:00.456
All of a sudden, he just said,
"I want to do this."

18:00.622 --> 18:03.709
And I have to tell you,
I tried to talk him out of it and said,

18:03.876 --> 18:06.211
"But you're really good with people.
You could be a good teacher."

18:06.378 --> 18:09.423
And I looked at him
and I told him,

18:09.590 --> 18:13.343
I said I'd disown him
if he joined the military.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.387
And it was something like,
"Oh, you know,

18:15.554 --> 18:18.223
it's really hard to get into,"
and all this.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.267
And don't say that to Mike,

18:20.434 --> 18:24.062
because when you say he can't do
something, he will just go for it.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.815
Of course you don't wish that
for your eldest son--

18:26.982 --> 18:30.027
to be put in harm's way.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.812
Captain Ryan McCombie:
SEALs are about team.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.855
They always are. They're not about
individual accomplishment.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.358
They're not about who--

19:09.525 --> 19:12.820
who can score the most points
in a basketball game.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.863
They're usually about the guy

19:15.030 --> 19:17.908
that made the best passes
in a basketball game,

19:18.075 --> 19:20.035
not the guy that dunked it.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.079
It must have been
something he read about

19:22.246 --> 19:24.873
and he liked the idea
of the work that they did

19:25.040 --> 19:27.501
and he got it in his head.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.378
And then
it was one of those--

19:29.545 --> 19:33.590
again, Michael becomes focused
and determined-- "Oh, this is my path."

19:33.757 --> 19:37.302
The first time I ever met Michael
was by phone

19:37.469 --> 19:39.346
when he called me up
and asked me

19:39.513 --> 19:43.600
if I would talk to him
about becoming a Navy SEAL.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.728
I told Michael to come by on--
I believe it was a Saturday--

19:46.895 --> 19:49.064
and I'd be happy
to talk to him about it.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.732
When he met Mike, he said

19:50.899 --> 19:52.985
there's certain guys
you tell right off the bat.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.404
And he said,
"I was out there chopping wood

19:55.571 --> 19:58.198
and Mike comes around the corner
and introduces himself

19:58.365 --> 19:59.825
and says,
'Hi. I'm Mike Murphy."'

19:59.992 --> 20:01.743
I was splitting wood
and said, "Who are you?"

20:01.910 --> 20:04.872
And he said that,
"I'm Michael Murphy."

20:05.038 --> 20:08.250
And I said, "Well, good for you.
I understand you'd like

20:08.417 --> 20:10.210
to talk about SEAL Team."

20:10.377 --> 20:12.421
And he looked at me

20:12.588 --> 20:15.591
and said, "No, sir,
I want to be a SEAL."

20:15.757 --> 20:17.759
He says, "I'm interested
in becoming a Navy SEAL."

20:17.926 --> 20:20.762
And with that,
he's chopping wood,

20:20.929 --> 20:22.431
he didn't even say anything
to Mike.

20:22.598 --> 20:25.058
Mike took off his jacket,
rolled up his sleeves

20:25.225 --> 20:27.477
and started helping him
chop the wood without even asking.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.272
We talked about SEAL Team
for some period of time

20:30.439 --> 20:32.774
and my experiences in it
and what I thought it would take

20:32.941 --> 20:35.611
for him to achieve that.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.654
And he convinced me

20:37.821 --> 20:40.782
that he absolutely should have
the opportunity to try,

20:40.949 --> 20:44.328
which was--
it's not often that that happens

20:44.494 --> 20:47.456
over a period of a singular--
single conversation.

20:47.623 --> 20:51.627
If he hadn't come out
and helped split the wood,

20:51.793 --> 20:54.129
our conversation
would have been very brief

20:54.296 --> 20:56.214
after we got done.
But he didn't know that.

20:56.381 --> 20:59.009
Men:
Two, three,

20:59.176 --> 21:01.637
four...

21:01.803 --> 21:05.057
You know,
Mike would go upstate

21:05.223 --> 21:07.434
to do fitness tests to qualify.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.979
And every day at the beach
was a chance to train.

21:11.146 --> 21:14.024
So he'd be doing sit-ups,
running, swimming,

21:14.191 --> 21:15.901
whether it would be leave here
and go to the pool

21:16.068 --> 21:18.278
to drown-proof himself
or to do sidestroke

21:18.445 --> 21:21.531
or do sit-ups till he yakked
and then continued some more.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.743
James: Oh, he literally
would do sit-ups till he puked.

21:24.910 --> 21:27.037
He'd come up,
turn to his side, puke

21:27.204 --> 21:30.165
and get mad at himself.
I was like, "What's wrong with you?"

21:30.332 --> 21:32.417
- Owen: Then continue doing sit-ups.
- And then keep going, yeah.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.462
And then he said something to me
which made me just say,

21:35.629 --> 21:37.047
"You know what, Mike?
Go for it."

21:37.214 --> 21:39.883
He said, "Mom, would you like me
to sit at a desk

21:40.050 --> 21:42.135
and not be happy
for the next 30 years

21:42.302 --> 21:44.638
or do you really--
would you be happy,

21:44.805 --> 21:47.683
you know, that I'm doing
something that I really want?"

21:47.849 --> 21:51.353
What can you say?
You just want what your kids--

21:51.520 --> 21:53.355
if they're happy,
you're fine with it.

21:53.522 --> 21:56.900
Even though it's dangerous work,
he was happy with it.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.819
He loved it.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.862
He'd do it all over again.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.448
I know him.
He would do it all over again.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.743
( blades whirring )

22:08.704 --> 22:11.540
Jeff Widenhofer: I went to Naval
Academy, graduated in 1997,

22:11.707 --> 22:13.709
went right to flight school
from there.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.836
I was down in Florida, San Diego,

22:16.003 --> 22:19.089
and Virginia, flying the H-46.

22:19.256 --> 22:21.466
I got to my squadron
right before September 11th,

22:21.633 --> 22:23.218
about a year before.
So I did a full deployment

22:23.385 --> 22:25.178
and then September 11th
happened,

22:25.345 --> 22:27.139
and everybody was going out to sea
and deploying

22:27.305 --> 22:28.974
and going to the Middle East
and that part of the world.

22:29.141 --> 22:31.393
And I went two more times
during my tour, so I was going a lot.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.105
So I was in Persian Gulf a whole lot
during that time.

22:35.272 --> 22:38.859
After my flying tour,
I went to be stationed

22:39.026 --> 22:40.861
at Kings Point
Merchant Marine Academy,

22:41.028 --> 22:44.865
which is there in Kings Point,
New York, on Long Island.

22:45.032 --> 22:47.367
So one of our extra duties
is to be available

22:47.534 --> 22:51.621
to be casualty officers
for any families in the local area.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.081
Man:
March!

22:53.248 --> 22:55.625
( band playing march music )

23:01.423 --> 23:05.010
Mike was from Long Island,
then went to Penn State University

23:05.177 --> 23:07.929
and graduated there,
right after that went to OCS.

23:08.096 --> 23:11.308
Daniel: We go down to see him
graduate from Pensacola.

23:11.475 --> 23:14.603
And I don't see him.
You know, we get down there,

23:14.770 --> 23:17.731
we get down there late,
and they're marching onto the field.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.067
Dan and I were catching a plane
to get down there,

23:20.233 --> 23:23.487
but there was a big windstorm, so
Newark Airport, you know, closed down.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.614
Dan and I had to take a car.

23:25.781 --> 23:27.449
So Maureen, John and I,
we drive there

23:27.616 --> 23:30.786
and they held us up
because they were--

23:30.952 --> 23:34.331
the graduating class
was marching down the road.

23:34.498 --> 23:36.458
Maureen:
There was about 400 of them

23:36.625 --> 23:38.794
in, you know, uniform.
And Danny looks over at me.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.754
And we're seeing them
coming at us.

23:40.921 --> 23:43.548
And Dan goes,
"You're never gonna see him in this.

23:43.715 --> 23:46.051
Everybody's all dressed alike.
It's like a sea of blue."

23:46.218 --> 23:48.136
I go and I turn to Maureen
and I say,

23:48.303 --> 23:50.639
"Maureen," I said, "there is no way
we're gonna be--

23:50.806 --> 23:52.474
I mean, how are we supposed
to find Michael?"

23:52.641 --> 23:55.060
And as I turned, I said,
"There he is right there."

23:55.227 --> 23:56.686
And I spotted him.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.730
And Maureen goes, she said,
"There he is."

23:58.897 --> 24:00.482
And Danny goes,
"How did you do that?"

24:00.649 --> 24:02.192
I said,
"I know that walk anywhere."

24:02.359 --> 24:04.653
And I said,
"How can you tell?"

24:04.820 --> 24:06.530
And she said,
"I'd know that walk anywhere.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.032
It looks--
he walks just like you."

24:09.199 --> 24:11.535
Actually, when I heard him
barking all these orders out,

24:11.701 --> 24:13.078
I was like, "That's Mike?"

24:13.245 --> 24:15.497
He sounded like--
this really deep voice and everything.

24:15.664 --> 24:17.916
I couldn't believe it was him.
He was very authoritative.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.710
But she spotted him right away,
which was amazing.

24:20.877 --> 24:22.712
They get a certain amount
of coins.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.881
And they give it to the first person
that salutes them.

24:25.048 --> 24:28.760
And you're supposed to give it to
the people that influenced you the most.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.555
And he gave one to his dad,
one to me and his brother.

24:31.721 --> 24:34.015
I have that coin.
I will never let that go.

24:34.182 --> 24:36.184
And I thought that--

24:37.435 --> 24:39.855
it was a beautiful thing.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.356
- ( double whistle )
- Men: Crawl.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.567
- ( double whistle )
- Crawl.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.695
- ( whistling repeats )
- Crawl. Crawl.

24:46.862 --> 24:48.864
( rapid gunfire rattles )

24:51.700 --> 24:53.785
- Trainer: Hold up boat.
- Men: Up boat.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.954
- Trainer: Down boat.
- Down boat.

24:56.121 --> 24:58.623
- Trainer: Up boat.
- Up boat.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.668
- Down boat.
- Down boat.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.211
- Hold up boat.
- Up boat.

25:03.378 --> 25:05.297
- Down boat.
- Trainer: Down--

25:06.548 --> 25:09.593
( commands repeat )

25:09.759 --> 25:13.346
Daniel: When he goes to BUD/S,
I was concerned

25:13.513 --> 25:16.183
because I knew how demanding
the program was.

25:16.349 --> 25:20.854
I also knew how people fail.

25:21.021 --> 25:23.190
You know, you read about

25:23.356 --> 25:27.027
less than 15%, 20% graduate.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.487
And I know Michael had a class
of about 200.

25:29.654 --> 25:33.950
And he was relaying to me
how one of the first initiations was,

25:34.117 --> 25:35.744
"Look to the guy to the left
of you

25:35.911 --> 25:38.538
and look to the guy
to the right of you.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.249
They won't make it
through the program."

25:41.416 --> 25:43.293
That's how difficult it is.

25:43.460 --> 25:46.922
Oftentimes the best athlete
in the class doesn't make it.

25:47.088 --> 25:50.050
I know in my class,
the best athlete in our class quit.

25:50.217 --> 25:52.719
It's very difficult
to look at somebody and say

25:52.886 --> 25:54.971
that he is a SEAL
or he's going to be a SEAL.

25:55.138 --> 25:58.475
I mean, today
they're 6'6", 260 pounds,

25:58.642 --> 26:02.938
down to 5' 5", 130 pounds.

26:03.104 --> 26:05.440
Because it's all in your heart
and it's all in your head.

26:05.607 --> 26:08.109
It's really not about
your physical abilities.

26:08.276 --> 26:09.945
They'll give you
the physical abilities.

26:10.111 --> 26:11.947
One thing about training
in the SEALs

26:12.113 --> 26:14.115
is they'll ensure that you have
the physical abilities.

26:14.282 --> 26:16.117
What they can't give people,

26:16.284 --> 26:18.161
and sometimes have difficulty

26:18.328 --> 26:21.122
recognizing it and defining it
prior to the beginning,

26:21.289 --> 26:23.166
is the mental and the heart.

26:24.251 --> 26:27.504
( blades whirring )

26:27.671 --> 26:29.923
Announcer: Meanwhile,
the division's 3rd Brigade

26:30.090 --> 26:32.509
had begun arriving from Hawaii
by airlift.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.886
Their destination was Pleiku

26:35.053 --> 26:37.222
in the central highlands
of Vietnam.

26:37.389 --> 26:40.684
This was to be the 25th
Infantry Division's forward base.

26:40.850 --> 26:44.729
Daniel: When I was injured in Vietnam,
I was in a hospital.

26:44.896 --> 26:48.692
And I had-- an RPG landed
at my left ankle.

26:48.858 --> 26:51.319
And I was wrapped
around a rock.

26:51.486 --> 26:55.699
And so I was peppered
from the waist down.

26:55.865 --> 26:57.826
So I survived.

26:57.993 --> 26:59.995
I wouldn't have survived
if I hadn't.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.163
But because I was wrapped
around a large rock

27:02.330 --> 27:05.041
and I was shooting uphill,
it landed at my left ankle,

27:05.208 --> 27:08.420
fractured my left ankle
and peppered me from the waist down.

27:08.586 --> 27:11.715
Because we were in the middle
of a major fight,

27:11.881 --> 27:14.676
I was laying on that mountain
for about seven hours

27:14.843 --> 27:17.637
till I finally got dusted off.
As I was being dusted off,

27:17.804 --> 27:19.848
I got shot in a leg by a sniper.

27:20.015 --> 27:21.891
And I looked and I said,
"I just got shot."

27:22.058 --> 27:24.019
And I said, "What a day."

27:27.522 --> 27:30.692
What happened in the hospital-- I was
in the 3rd Field Hospital in Saigon

27:30.859 --> 27:33.820
and the general came in
and was pinning this Purple Heart on me.

27:33.987 --> 27:36.698
And he took a picture.
I wasn't aware of it at the time,

27:36.865 --> 27:39.451
that they take that picture
and they send it to my parents.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.501
Maureen:
It was St. Patrick's Day.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.087
Michael liked St. Patrick's Day.
And I was in Manhattan.

27:51.254 --> 27:55.091
And I was watching the parade.
And I went to give him a call.

27:55.258 --> 27:58.219
And the phone--
there was no answer.

27:58.386 --> 28:00.764
So I called later on during the day
and later on,

28:00.930 --> 28:04.476
and I said, "Something's up,"
because he would have called me back.

28:04.642 --> 28:07.020
So he doesn't call.

28:07.187 --> 28:09.230
Maureen realizes that there's
something wrong right away.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.066
So she calls me and she says,

28:11.232 --> 28:14.319
"Dan, you know, I didn't hear
from Michael on St. Patrick's Day.

28:14.486 --> 28:16.112
I think there's some--
there's a problem."

28:16.279 --> 28:18.239
I wanted to wish him
a happy St. Patrick's Day.

28:18.406 --> 28:20.200
So I didn't hear from him.

28:20.367 --> 28:23.244
And about 10 days later,
I get a phone call

28:23.411 --> 28:26.414
and I pick up and it's Mike.
And the first thing I say is,

28:26.581 --> 28:28.458
"What happened to you?
You were in the hospital."

28:28.625 --> 28:32.045
As usual, Michael is so focused
and determined,

28:32.212 --> 28:36.674
he ignores the initial signs
of there being a problem,

28:36.841 --> 28:40.095
because he's so focused on
completing BUD/S and getting through

28:40.261 --> 28:44.641
that it gets worse
until eventually he can't walk

28:44.808 --> 28:48.770
and they have to cut him
out of his boots and his clothing.

28:48.937 --> 28:52.941
Michael's thought wasn't about
worrying about losing a leg.

28:53.108 --> 28:55.318
It was, "Oh, I'm gonna be rolled
to the next BUD/S class."

28:55.485 --> 28:58.988
Yeah, Murphy during training--
it happens quite frequently--

28:59.155 --> 29:01.116
ended up getting a pretty severe
case of cellulitis,

29:01.282 --> 29:03.159
which, you know, I've had it.
I've had it before.

29:03.326 --> 29:05.203
And it's extraordinarily painful.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.831
It's a pretty serious bacteria--
staph infection.

29:07.997 --> 29:12.419
Maureen: Apparently he got--
I think it's called cellulitis.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.338
And he almost lost his legs
because of it.

29:15.505 --> 29:17.298
And Michael got it
so severe in his legs

29:17.465 --> 29:18.967
that he ended up having to
roll back in training.

29:19.134 --> 29:21.845
He goes, "Mama, I was rolled."
And "rolled" means that

29:22.011 --> 29:26.307
he couldn't go back
to his original SEAL class.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.810
When you get rolled out
of your BUD/S class,

29:28.977 --> 29:31.146
you-- a lot of guys
just lose heart.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.939
We have a saying
in the teams, you know,

29:33.106 --> 29:35.150
"Everyone wants to be a frogman
on a sunny day."

29:35.316 --> 29:37.819
But, you know, most of your days
are gonna be cold, wet and sandy,

29:37.986 --> 29:39.821
especially in BUD/S.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.031
And sometimes one more injury
on top of that

29:42.198 --> 29:43.950
like cellulitis,
and you get rolled back,

29:44.117 --> 29:46.077
it can be that one thing
that pushes you over the edge to say,

29:46.244 --> 29:48.037
"You know what?
I don't want it that much."

29:48.204 --> 29:52.208
He never spoke about
how difficult it was

29:52.375 --> 29:54.878
or the different things
he had to endure

29:55.044 --> 29:56.379
to get through what he did.

29:56.546 --> 29:59.466
He calls me up, I guess, about
the week before he starts Hell Week,

29:59.632 --> 30:01.301
and he says to me,
"Dad," he said,

30:01.468 --> 30:04.012
"do you remember that picture
that Grandma had of you,

30:04.179 --> 30:06.931
you know, from Vietnam
when you were in the hospital bed?"

30:07.098 --> 30:10.351
And I said, "Yes."
And he said, "Could you do me a favor?"

30:10.518 --> 30:13.480
He said, "Do you have any extras?"
And I said, "Yeah."

30:13.646 --> 30:15.607
And he said,
"Could you send me one?"

30:15.773 --> 30:17.859
And I said to him, I said,
"Michael,

30:18.026 --> 30:20.653
why do you want that picture?"

30:20.820 --> 30:23.198
And he says to me,
he says, "Dad..."

30:25.533 --> 30:28.828
He said, "If you could get
through that,"

30:28.995 --> 30:30.872
he said, "then I can
get through Hell Week."

30:33.416 --> 30:37.837
And I just thought
to myself...

30:40.465 --> 30:44.385
if a son could give a father
a compliment,

30:44.552 --> 30:48.389
( stammering )
You-- you prob--

30:48.556 --> 30:50.934
you probably couldn't get
a better compliment,

30:51.100 --> 30:54.062
that he not only recognized
my service,

30:54.229 --> 30:58.858
but he understood the difficulties
that I went through

30:59.025 --> 31:01.903
and recognizing,
"Dad, if you could get through that,

31:02.070 --> 31:05.490
and-- and I was so proud
of what you did,

31:05.657 --> 31:07.742
then I should be able
to get through Hell Week,

31:07.909 --> 31:12.664
which is nowhere near
what you had to deal with."

31:12.830 --> 31:14.707
For Michael, it was just--

31:14.874 --> 31:17.126
it was just one more obstacle
he had to overcome.

31:17.293 --> 31:19.045
And he didn't look back.

31:19.212 --> 31:22.340
And, you know, it's a testament
to his character

31:22.507 --> 31:25.260
and a testament to, you know,
his quiet passion

31:25.426 --> 31:27.554
and commitment to making it
on the team.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.264
He went to SEAL training
to become a SEAL.

31:29.430 --> 31:30.932
That was--
and nothing was gonna stop it.

31:36.187 --> 31:38.398
Maureen:
I sent him a card.

31:38.565 --> 31:40.942
When he was little,
he used to like

31:41.109 --> 31:43.987
the story about the train.

31:44.153 --> 31:46.447
I go to the card store
and I see this card.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.449
And it's a little train.

31:48.616 --> 31:51.244
And it says,
"I think I can, I think I can."

31:51.411 --> 31:54.706
And when you open the card, it said,
"I knew you could. Love, Mom."

31:54.872 --> 31:58.376
He called me when he got it
and he said,

31:58.543 --> 32:01.212
"Mom," he said,
"that was the best present I ever got,"

32:01.379 --> 32:04.757
he says, "that you knew
that I could do it."

32:09.137 --> 32:10.972
Velez: These are just tons
of memories--

32:11.139 --> 32:14.851
memories from high school,

32:15.018 --> 32:16.561
junior high, all the way
up until now even.

32:16.728 --> 32:19.897
Over here, these are
some of my jujitsu medals,

32:20.064 --> 32:22.567
some of my science medals.
This medical shadow box--

32:22.734 --> 32:25.653
my dad gave this one to me.
It was for one of my birthdays.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.822
And I remember he gave it to me
and I'm looking at it

32:27.989 --> 32:29.324
and in my mind I'm thinking,

32:29.490 --> 32:31.534
"This is probably a hundred years old."
( laughs )

32:31.701 --> 32:33.828
I'm looking at it now
and realizing, most likely not.

32:33.995 --> 32:37.206
But realizing how
the medical profession

32:37.373 --> 32:40.251
was back then and how it is now,
and, you know,

32:40.418 --> 32:43.004
despite all the advances in technology
and medicine and science,

32:43.171 --> 32:45.423
it's still helping somebody.

32:45.590 --> 32:48.343
I'm very proud,
very proud of Hector

32:48.509 --> 32:52.180
as-- as the person

32:52.347 --> 32:56.434
that he is developing into,

32:56.601 --> 32:59.771
very proud that he's choosing--
and I want to be very clear--

32:59.937 --> 33:02.690
not medicine or what it is.

33:02.857 --> 33:06.819
I'm very proud that he's choosing
to give of himself and to help others.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.197
Leaving high school, I knew,

33:09.364 --> 33:11.366
I knew, I knew, I knew
that I was gonna be a doctor.

33:11.532 --> 33:14.035
So, through college, that was
the unifying thread

33:14.202 --> 33:16.204
in all my internships,
all my research experience.

33:16.371 --> 33:18.539
I wanted that passion,
that contact with people,

33:18.706 --> 33:20.708
where I could relate to them
and I could try to help them out

33:20.875 --> 33:22.669
in any way possible.
Obviously, as an undergrad,

33:22.835 --> 33:25.296
I don't have all the skills
where I could be treating patients,

33:25.463 --> 33:29.050
but in any way that I could,
that's what I was willing to do.

33:34.472 --> 33:37.058
Widenhofer: Mike and Heather
went to Penn State together.

33:37.225 --> 33:39.268
They knew each other there,
but they didn't start dating

33:39.435 --> 33:42.313
till he had graduated
and he'd gone off to OCS

33:42.480 --> 33:44.190
and was now in the Navy.

33:44.357 --> 33:47.402
And once he was--
once he moved to Hawaii

33:47.568 --> 33:49.570
and was stationed
with his SEAL team out there,

33:49.737 --> 33:51.739
then that's when they
got engaged.

33:51.906 --> 33:53.741
He lost touch with all of us.

33:53.908 --> 33:57.537
We didn't know that he had
circled back with Heather.

33:57.704 --> 33:59.997
None of us knew that.

34:00.164 --> 34:03.793
And when I heard
that they were actually engaged

34:03.960 --> 34:06.546
and she was his fiancée,
it made me feel a little bit better,

34:06.713 --> 34:10.341
because knowing how much
he loved her

34:10.507 --> 34:12.385
all through college--

34:12.552 --> 34:15.596
I mean, he was--
she was his Everest.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.514
I mean, he adored her.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.516
A year before she went
to Penn State,

34:19.684 --> 34:21.768
someone introduced them

34:21.936 --> 34:23.646
because she was gonna go.

34:23.813 --> 34:25.690
And he, being Mike,
you know--

34:25.857 --> 34:27.859
"I'll show her around.
I'll take care of her."

34:28.025 --> 34:30.110
Evidently he decided

34:30.277 --> 34:32.612
he was gonna take care of her
for a lot longer than the four years.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.533
You talk about sticking to goals

34:35.699 --> 34:37.827
or having
mental toughness--

34:37.994 --> 34:41.581
I mean, he always knew
that she was the girl for him.

34:41.748 --> 34:43.206
Yeah, he was crazy
about Heather.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.126
That was-- we all knew that.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.309
Mike was pretty quiet.

35:01.476 --> 35:03.311
He was-- again,
he was a junior guy out of--

35:03.478 --> 35:06.481
he was an L2,
or a Lieutenant Junior Grade.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.483
And I was, like,
Lieutenant Commander at the time.

35:08.649 --> 35:11.736
When you're forward deployed,
every day is Groundhog Day.

35:11.903 --> 35:14.322
It's always the same
and it's got plenty of work.

35:14.489 --> 35:17.658
And again, I will tell you,
Mike was--

35:17.825 --> 35:21.496
he was just a very conscientious,
dedicated young guy.

35:21.662 --> 35:23.581
You know, he understood
the big picture.

35:23.748 --> 35:27.084
It may not be what he wanted to do
or where he wanted to be,

35:27.251 --> 35:28.711
but he knew
that was the best way

35:28.878 --> 35:30.338
he could support us,
the command, at the time.

35:30.505 --> 35:33.508
And so, he rucked up
and did the job.

35:33.674 --> 35:36.302
And as I talked to him
off-line one time,

35:36.469 --> 35:39.180
I said, "There'll come a day
when you're gonna get tested,

35:39.347 --> 35:42.600
so, you know, just be patient."

35:42.767 --> 35:44.560
And Michael was tested.

35:44.727 --> 35:47.188
He rarely spoke of the SEALs.

35:47.355 --> 35:51.317
He would answer our questions

35:51.484 --> 35:53.653
very vaguely,
I would have to say.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.530
You know, "Oh, it's tough."
( chuckles )

35:55.696 --> 35:57.365
"Oh, yeah, I've gone
a couple of places."

35:57.532 --> 35:59.242
Daniel: And he gave us
some instructions, he said,

35:59.408 --> 36:00.993
"I can't tell you where I am,"
he said,

36:01.160 --> 36:04.205
"but I will keep in touch by e-mail.
Please do me a favor,

36:04.372 --> 36:06.582
do not talk about
time differentials,

36:06.749 --> 36:10.545
because time differentials
deal with the location."

36:10.711 --> 36:12.463
Maureen: He didn't really
talk much about it

36:12.630 --> 36:14.757
because a lot of things
that he had to do,

36:14.924 --> 36:18.553
you know, they're very tight-lipped
about it, most of them are.

36:18.719 --> 36:21.389
Michael would relate funny stories.
He said, "Oh, it was funny.

36:21.556 --> 36:25.393
I was out."
And he said, "I was running."

36:25.560 --> 36:27.436
He was jogging one time,

36:27.603 --> 36:30.565
and he saw these green eyes
on the side.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.233
And then he saw another pair.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.694
So all they had was
shorts and boots, that's it.

36:34.861 --> 36:36.612
He didn't have
anything else with him.

36:36.779 --> 36:38.906
He said,
"And I didn't carry my weapon."

36:39.073 --> 36:42.368
And he said, "And I got attacked
by a bunch of hyenas."

36:42.535 --> 36:45.913
Maureen: One of the hyenas
went to go lunge at him.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.333
And he just jammed it right in the face
with his fist.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.586
He yelped like a little dog.

36:51.752 --> 36:53.838
Scurried away,
because they travel in packs.

36:54.005 --> 36:55.882
He said, "I'm kicking him

36:56.048 --> 36:58.718
and trying to run
at the same time."

36:58.885 --> 37:00.761
The reason why I know
is because

37:00.928 --> 37:02.805
I found out about it
and then I questioned him.

37:02.972 --> 37:07.101
And Maureen said,
"Michael, there's no hyenas in Iraq."

37:07.268 --> 37:09.437
And he said,
"Oh, Mom, you caught me."

37:09.604 --> 37:11.188
And he said,
"Yeah, I was in Africa."

37:11.355 --> 37:13.524
And that's when he said,
"Mom, I nearly lost my life."

37:13.691 --> 37:15.276
He says,
"It was kind of scary."

37:15.443 --> 37:17.445
When he would come home,
no, he would never talk about work.

37:17.612 --> 37:19.864
It was just, "Hey, how are you doing?"
And everything was about--

37:20.031 --> 37:21.908
never about him.
It was about, "How are you?"

37:22.074 --> 37:23.910
You know?
That's just-- no, I never heard--

37:24.076 --> 37:25.536
I would try to pull stuff
out of him,

37:25.703 --> 37:27.747
but never-- he would never
talk about work.

37:27.914 --> 37:30.124
We all stayed in touch with Michael
through e-mails

37:30.291 --> 37:32.501
and kept up with what's going on.
When he could tell us

37:32.668 --> 37:34.962
where he was, he did.
You know, that wasn't very often.

37:35.129 --> 37:37.089
But, you know,
he e-mails me one day

37:37.256 --> 37:39.425
and he's like, "Hey, Owen,
can I get a firehouse patch?"

37:39.592 --> 37:41.427
So I said, "No problem, Mike.
I'll get you a patch."

37:41.594 --> 37:43.429
Then in the next e-mail he says,

37:43.596 --> 37:47.850
"Well, actually, I need 30 patches."
"30 patches?"

37:48.017 --> 37:50.478
Now to be honest, that's more guys
than we had in the firehouse.

37:50.645 --> 37:54.357
And he told me that basically
he wanted a reason...

37:54.523 --> 37:55.524
James: The guys know
why they're there.

37:55.691 --> 37:57.735
Owen: ...the guys could think about
while they're away,

37:57.902 --> 37:59.820
something from home,
to remind them why they're there

37:59.987 --> 38:02.490
and what they were doing
and who they were there for.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.617
So the minute he got
the patches,

38:04.784 --> 38:06.911
Mike sewed it onto his uniform.

38:07.078 --> 38:09.914
And his teammates told me
he wore it every day, every mission,

38:10.081 --> 38:13.084
just to constantly remind himself
and the guys he worked with

38:13.250 --> 38:15.127
that there was a bigger picture,

38:15.294 --> 38:17.171
the people back home
who they were fighting for,

38:17.338 --> 38:19.298
and the people that suffered
after 9/11,

38:19.465 --> 38:21.467
not to forget.

38:40.152 --> 38:42.196
Widenhofer:
Operation Red Wings

38:42.363 --> 38:45.741
was a mission to get some
real bad guys out in the Hindu Kush.

38:45.908 --> 38:49.078
Those guys were remote.
They were far away.

38:49.245 --> 38:51.497
It was enemy territory.

38:51.664 --> 38:53.541
And we sent in

38:53.708 --> 38:56.419
Mike, Axe,

38:56.585 --> 38:59.213
Marcus and Danny

38:59.380 --> 39:01.757
to go get their eyes
on the bad guys

39:01.924 --> 39:03.926
as close as possible.

39:04.093 --> 39:06.220
And they--
they went out there

39:06.387 --> 39:08.014
and were out there
for several days.

39:08.180 --> 39:09.849
They were compromised.

39:10.016 --> 39:12.810
The enemy found them,
was tracking them down.

39:12.977 --> 39:15.146
And in a real short
amount of time,

39:15.312 --> 39:17.440
probably just minutes
and hours maybe,

39:17.606 --> 39:19.400
they were in a huge firefight.

39:19.567 --> 39:22.403
( gunfire crackling )

39:24.030 --> 39:25.990
O'Shea:
I was in Iraq serving

39:26.157 --> 39:29.076
when the call came in--
came in to MNFI,

39:29.243 --> 39:31.203
Multinational Forces Iraq,
at about midnight

39:31.370 --> 39:34.582
that four troops were in contact,
or troops in contact.

39:34.749 --> 39:37.793
And I was told,
"Hey, Dan, those are four SEALs."

39:37.960 --> 39:39.420
I said, "What do you have?"

39:39.587 --> 39:41.297
And he said,
"Well, I'll get you more information.

39:41.464 --> 39:44.091
We don't have any names yet, but
they're in the firefight of their life."

39:44.258 --> 39:47.094
And I went back in, you know,
first thing the next morning.

39:47.261 --> 39:49.263
And sure enough, by that point
the battle had been going on,

39:49.430 --> 39:53.100
raging for hours,
and still not a whole lot of detail.

39:53.267 --> 39:55.728
I was watching television,
the news.

39:55.895 --> 39:58.022
And on the news

39:58.189 --> 40:01.525
it had this picture of,

40:01.692 --> 40:03.611
like, fake mountains.

40:03.778 --> 40:05.946
It was almost like,
drawn on there,

40:06.113 --> 40:07.615
like, you know,
like mountains.

40:07.782 --> 40:10.284
But they said that
they were outnumbered

40:10.451 --> 40:12.787
and there's just four men
trapped on the ground

40:12.953 --> 40:14.997
and these guys
are under heavy fire.

40:15.164 --> 40:16.582
And I thought,
"Oh, my God."

40:16.749 --> 40:19.960
And then I went, "Oh, no."
I said, "What's the shot of that?"

40:20.127 --> 40:22.838
At the operations center,
they were following the beacons

40:23.005 --> 40:25.007
and they knew
the guys were there,

40:25.174 --> 40:27.468
but they had no idea
what was actually unfolding.

40:27.635 --> 40:29.553
So I went to work the next day

40:29.720 --> 40:31.597
and somebody came in
and said,

40:31.764 --> 40:34.308
"Oh, my God, did you know
there was a helicopter

40:34.475 --> 40:36.477
that went down
with Navy SEALs?"

40:36.644 --> 40:38.896
And I said, "Well,
that happened yesterday."

40:39.063 --> 40:40.981
And she goes,
"No, I heard it today on the news."

40:41.148 --> 40:43.984
And I said, "Oh." And then I started
to get a little bit nervous,

40:44.151 --> 40:46.112
'cause it was like, "Well, that was
two stories I heard."

40:46.278 --> 40:48.155
That Chinook that went in

40:48.322 --> 40:50.241
to get those guys,
the Quick Reaction Force,

40:50.407 --> 40:52.576
was a helo aircraft

40:52.743 --> 40:55.162
full of real American heroes,

40:55.329 --> 40:58.999
real dedicated, talented,

40:59.166 --> 41:01.377
tough people.

41:01.544 --> 41:03.754
People that you want to be out
doing that type of work.

41:03.921 --> 41:07.258
So by the time I got home,

41:07.424 --> 41:11.846
actually, Heather
had called and said,

41:12.012 --> 41:14.515
"Did you hear anything?"
And I said, "No."

41:14.682 --> 41:17.518
So, you know,
I was starting

41:17.685 --> 41:19.728
to get a little bit more worried
about it and everything.

41:19.895 --> 41:22.898
And she said that-- she said,
"Well, there's a number,

41:23.065 --> 41:24.984
but I'm not married to him,
so I can't get through."

41:25.151 --> 41:26.610
So I said,
"Well, give me the number."

41:26.777 --> 41:29.113
As an aviator,
as a helicopter pilot,

41:29.280 --> 41:32.825
I know how badly
you want to get in and help.

41:32.992 --> 41:35.286
They wanted to start saving lives.

41:35.452 --> 41:38.372
And they were just
totally focused on--

41:38.539 --> 41:41.542
on getting in there despite
what was being shot at them,

41:41.709 --> 41:44.211
despite what was around them
or who was in front of them

41:44.378 --> 41:47.548
or to the side of them.
They go and they do the work.

41:47.715 --> 41:50.467
And I knew something was up
because when I called California,

41:50.634 --> 41:53.220
all I said was,
"My name is Maureen Murphy.

41:53.387 --> 41:56.015
I'm calling about my son Mike."
And I kept getting pushed.

41:56.182 --> 41:58.851
And then it was like-- you know,
like put onto somebody else.

41:59.018 --> 42:00.686
Then I knew-- "Oh, my God,
I didn't even give

42:00.853 --> 42:04.940
any other identification other than
my name and Mike's first name."

42:05.107 --> 42:09.403
And then I had a feeling, "Oh, my God,
he's involved in this," you know?

42:09.570 --> 42:11.614
Heather came down
and asked, you know.

42:11.780 --> 42:13.657
And I said,
"Look, he's in Iraq."

42:13.824 --> 42:15.701
I said, "He just sent me
a picture

42:15.868 --> 42:18.579
for Father's Day
of him and his team."

42:18.746 --> 42:21.207
I said, "And there were mountains
in the background,"

42:21.373 --> 42:23.876
I said, you know, so--
but it looked like desert.

42:24.043 --> 42:26.295
I said, "They're in desert fatigues."
I said, "He's in Iraq."

42:26.462 --> 42:28.255
And she said, "Yeah, but what about
those mountains there?"

42:28.422 --> 42:31.759
Dan got an e-mail
on Father's Day from Mike.

42:31.926 --> 42:34.845
And I got an e-mail from him
and I said, "Well, thank God."

42:35.012 --> 42:38.098
Because he said, "Mama, I'm back,
but I've been away for a while.

42:38.265 --> 42:40.392
I'm sorry I didn't keep in contact,
but everything's okay.

42:40.559 --> 42:43.938
I really like it here. And I got some
really funny stories to tell you

42:44.104 --> 42:45.439
and some sad ones too."

42:45.606 --> 42:48.025
One of my friends
is a county attorney.

42:48.192 --> 42:49.568
His name-- Tony.

42:49.735 --> 42:53.364
And he's a reserve lieutenant colonel
in the Army.

42:53.530 --> 42:56.408
And he's been to Iraq
and a bunch of places.

42:56.575 --> 42:58.535
And so he says,
"Oh, how's Mike doing?"

42:58.702 --> 43:00.246
I said, "Oh, he's deployed.
I think he's in--"

43:00.412 --> 43:03.457
I said, "I believe he's in Iraq.
He sent me this great picture

43:03.624 --> 43:05.209
of him and his SEAL team."

43:05.376 --> 43:07.211
And he looks at it and he said,
"He's in Afghanistan."

43:07.378 --> 43:09.046
I said, "No, he's not."
I said, "He's in Iraq."

43:09.213 --> 43:10.839
'Cause I had known
he went to Qatar.

43:11.006 --> 43:13.634
We were like-- we didn't really
know what was going on.

43:13.801 --> 43:15.886
But it was getting kind of like
a little bit tense.

43:16.053 --> 43:18.347
And, you know, I said,
"Oh, my God, this is literally

43:18.514 --> 43:19.890
kind of getting me scared,"
you know?

43:20.057 --> 43:22.977
When Heather comes down
and Maureen,

43:23.143 --> 43:26.480
I'm trying to reassure them,
"No, he's in Iraq. Everything's okay."

43:26.647 --> 43:29.942
But in the back of my head, you know,
that little birdie sits there and says,

43:30.109 --> 43:32.319
"Oh, boy," you know,
"Tony told me that's Afghanistan.

43:32.486 --> 43:34.154
Maybe this isn't so good."

43:34.321 --> 43:36.490
Anyway, that night

43:36.657 --> 43:40.035
I went to bed and I just said,
"You know what?

43:40.202 --> 43:42.079
I'm just gonna say my prayers
before I go to bed."

43:42.246 --> 43:44.498
it was almost 12:00.
And I remember saying to John,

43:44.665 --> 43:48.502
"You know what, John?" I said,
"I called about six, seven hours ago."

43:48.669 --> 43:51.505
I said, "We haven't heard anything.
That's probably a good sign."

43:51.672 --> 43:54.258
So I got through
saying my prayers

43:54.425 --> 43:57.803
and as I put out the light,

43:57.970 --> 44:00.597
I heard a car pull up

44:00.764 --> 44:02.975
and I heard four doors closing.

44:03.142 --> 44:05.019
So we parked the car
across the street

44:05.185 --> 44:06.937
in a little parking lot
right outside the house.

44:07.104 --> 44:09.398
And the first thing I notice is
all the lights are on.

44:09.565 --> 44:11.859
And it's pretty late.
It's almost midnight.

44:12.026 --> 44:13.861
But they're awake.

44:14.028 --> 44:15.988
And I thought
that was a good thing,

44:16.155 --> 44:17.990
but it also meant
we had to get to work right away.

44:18.157 --> 44:20.909
And the doorbell rang.
And I told John, so naive,

44:21.076 --> 44:23.537
I said, "John, don't answer it,"
'cause I figured they'd go away.

44:23.704 --> 44:27.333
John answered and said, "Mom,
you probably want to come down here.

44:27.499 --> 44:29.460
There's some guys in uniform
outside."

44:29.626 --> 44:32.379
Took their hats off
and stood back for a minute,

44:32.546 --> 44:34.673
asked me who I was.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.217
And I just said,
"No. No."

44:37.384 --> 44:39.887
And I just did not
want to hear it.

44:40.054 --> 44:42.639
We told her right away
that Mike was missing.

44:42.806 --> 44:45.017
We made sure to not say
that he was deceased.

44:45.184 --> 44:47.227
We didn't know what was going on
out in Afghanistan.

44:47.394 --> 44:50.356
We just got word that he
and the three other guys

44:50.522 --> 44:53.275
were missing and they weren't
in communication.

44:53.442 --> 44:55.486
And Father Coyle--
he was really good.

44:55.652 --> 44:57.404
He stepped forward and he said,
"I'm a chaplain."

44:57.571 --> 44:59.907
He goes, "Mike wasn't
in the helicopter,"

45:00.074 --> 45:04.870
which-- I had,
like, temporary relief.

45:05.037 --> 45:07.539
And he said, "He wasn't in
the helicopter. He was on the ground."

45:07.706 --> 45:09.249
And he says,
"He's just missing."

45:09.416 --> 45:11.085
She wasn't falling apart
or anything,

45:11.251 --> 45:12.920
because we weren't giving her
much information.

45:13.087 --> 45:14.922
She was trying
to get more from us.

45:15.089 --> 45:18.300
But Father Coyle was there,
kind of settled us all down.

45:18.467 --> 45:24.014
And he said a prayer.
And we all joined in.

45:24.181 --> 45:27.267
Maureen calls me right away.
I live just down the block.

45:27.434 --> 45:30.437
So she calls me
and she says,

45:30.604 --> 45:33.107
"The Navy is here, Dan.
Michael is missing."

45:33.273 --> 45:35.442
You're creating
these images of,

45:35.609 --> 45:38.070
you know, if he's alive now,
where is he?

45:38.237 --> 45:40.155
Is he captured?
Is he on the run?

45:40.322 --> 45:42.491
It's like really painful
when you don't know

45:42.658 --> 45:44.451
what happened to your child.

45:44.618 --> 45:46.995
Even though he's a grown man,
but he's still your child.

45:47.162 --> 45:50.082
And you don't know
if he's maybe

45:50.249 --> 45:52.960
hiding behind a rock
and bleeding to death

45:53.127 --> 45:55.045
or maybe they're torturing him

45:55.212 --> 45:57.923
or doing something,
you know, horrible,

45:58.090 --> 46:00.676
or maybe just
dying there by himself,

46:00.843 --> 46:03.095
you know, maybe
in a cave or something,

46:03.262 --> 46:05.472
if he was lucky enough
to get away.

46:05.639 --> 46:08.684
And so I started asking,
you know, questions about,

46:08.851 --> 46:11.520
what do we know, like,
what happened, et cetera, et cetera.

46:11.687 --> 46:13.856
And they didn't have
a lot of information there.

46:14.022 --> 46:15.524
He's missing?
What are you talking about?

46:15.691 --> 46:19.194
So I leave work. I go. It was right
around the corner from his house.

46:19.361 --> 46:23.657
And everybody's, you know--
and it wasn't confirmed yet.

46:23.824 --> 46:26.743
But I just figured

46:26.910 --> 46:29.663
there's no way he's gonna--
you know, the team is missing.

46:29.830 --> 46:31.665
He's gonna pop up somewhere.
It's just how he was.

46:31.832 --> 46:33.208
He's gonna find a way
to get out.

46:33.375 --> 46:36.378
We try to reassure each other
that everything's gonna work out,

46:36.545 --> 46:41.133
and these are the most elite,
trained military persons

46:41.300 --> 46:43.177
we have in the country.

46:43.343 --> 46:45.429
- Retreated to Maureen's house.
- We retreated to Maureen's house

46:45.596 --> 46:48.307
- to see how she was doing and try--
- To do anything for her.

46:48.474 --> 46:50.434
Provide any comfort and help
we could to her.

46:50.601 --> 46:53.103
And Maureen said,
"Let's get these uniforms off.

46:53.270 --> 46:55.147
It's stressing me out
too much."

46:55.314 --> 46:58.775
So we came over
in regular clothes the next day.

46:58.942 --> 47:02.321
It starts off small and ends up
to be like-- like a lot more.

47:02.488 --> 47:05.532
There was probably
30, 40 people at--

47:05.699 --> 47:08.160
you know, at some points

47:08.327 --> 47:10.245
just waiting for news.

47:10.412 --> 47:13.415
There were points
during those four days

47:13.582 --> 47:16.877
that we were able to laugh
and we shared margaritas

47:17.044 --> 47:19.213
and we had some beers.

47:19.379 --> 47:22.090
And we held onto some hope
that we got,

47:22.257 --> 47:24.593
that sprinkled in
from some of the reports.

47:24.760 --> 47:28.597
My house was filled with, like,
a hundred people at a clip,

47:28.764 --> 47:30.307
between people
coming and going.

47:30.474 --> 47:33.352
And they were really kind.
They brought all kinds of food.

47:33.519 --> 47:35.437
Even neighbors
I didn't even really know

47:35.604 --> 47:37.606
had brought all kinds of food
and everything,

47:37.773 --> 47:40.025
'cause there was just
so much going on.

47:40.192 --> 47:43.779
And so for six days
he was missing.

47:43.946 --> 47:45.864
But the rest of the time
was difficult, you know.

47:46.031 --> 47:47.699
We passed the time
with small talk.

47:47.866 --> 47:50.452
And the news was on constantly
in the background.

47:50.619 --> 47:52.454
And anytime
anything would come up,

47:52.621 --> 47:54.790
we'd stop what we were doing
and listen.

47:54.957 --> 47:56.750
And it was excruciating.

47:56.917 --> 47:58.627
You know, I said, "Maureen,
he knows what he's doing.

47:58.794 --> 48:00.837
He's great at this.
He's a smart guy," you know.

48:01.004 --> 48:04.258
She said, "But he's not gonna
get hurt on his own.

48:04.424 --> 48:06.593
He's gonna get hurt
trying to protect somebody."

48:20.148 --> 48:23.402
Maureen: It was a couple of minutes just
before the end of the Fourth of July.

48:23.569 --> 48:27.864
And we got the news
that Michael didn't make it.

48:28.031 --> 48:31.577
And I went into total shock,

48:31.743 --> 48:34.830
'cause I was, like, looking,
and everybody's crying.

48:34.997 --> 48:38.166
And my body just shut down.
I just was like--

48:38.333 --> 48:41.169
all I could think of is,
he's not in pain anymore

48:41.336 --> 48:45.007
and that he's in heaven

48:45.173 --> 48:47.509
and...

48:47.676 --> 48:51.138
all the pain that he probably
did suffer is gone.

48:51.305 --> 48:55.350
And I don't know,
I just got this numb feeling.

48:55.517 --> 48:59.313
And I just was telling people
he's okay, you know,

48:59.479 --> 49:02.316
and not to be upset.
I don't know.

49:02.482 --> 49:04.359
Well, when he showed up
that night in his whites,

49:04.526 --> 49:08.071
because this was formal,
Dan was walking around his back yard.

49:08.238 --> 49:10.616
And I saw him turn to Jeff
and say,

49:10.782 --> 49:12.534
"I don't want to talk to you."

49:12.701 --> 49:14.119
And I heard Mr. Murphy,

49:14.286 --> 49:16.330
I heard him yell a few times
he didn't want to talk to Jeff.

49:16.496 --> 49:18.040
"Keep Jeff away.
I don't want to see him."

49:18.206 --> 49:20.208
Dan had rosaries

49:20.375 --> 49:22.878
that he held for five days
while Mike was missing.

49:23.045 --> 49:25.797
And I had come to find out
during the course of those five days

49:25.964 --> 49:28.050
that those rosaries
had belonged to my mother.

49:28.216 --> 49:30.636
And when my brother Dan
was hurt in Vietnam,

49:30.802 --> 49:33.513
my mother held onto those rosaries
until she knew he was okay.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.016
So for five days
Dan held those rosaries.

49:36.183 --> 49:39.227
He started to walk into his house, and
there was a garbage can to his right.

49:39.394 --> 49:41.188
And he took the rosary beads

49:41.355 --> 49:43.106
and he just threw them in the garbage
and kept walking.

49:43.273 --> 49:47.444
While conducting surveillance
on a mountain ridge in Afghanistan,

49:47.611 --> 49:49.613
he and three fellow SEALs
were surrounded

49:49.780 --> 49:52.532
by a much larger enemy force.

49:52.699 --> 49:55.243
Their only escape
was down the side of a mountain.

49:55.410 --> 49:58.330
And the SEALs launched
a valiant counterattack

49:58.497 --> 50:01.750
while cascading
from cliff to cliff.

50:01.917 --> 50:03.251
But as the enemy closed in,

50:03.418 --> 50:05.545
Michael recognized
that the survival of his men

50:05.712 --> 50:09.132
depended on calling back
to the base for reinforcements.

50:09.299 --> 50:12.135
With complete disregard
for his own life,

50:12.302 --> 50:15.597
he moved into a clearing
where his phone would get reception.

50:15.764 --> 50:18.100
He made the call,

50:18.266 --> 50:21.311
and Michael then
fell under heavy fire.

50:21.478 --> 50:23.730
Yet his grace and upbringing
never deserted him.

50:23.897 --> 50:25.774
Though severely wounded,

50:25.941 --> 50:28.110
he said, "Thank you,"
before hanging up

50:28.276 --> 50:31.988
and returned to the fight
before losing his life.

50:32.155 --> 50:34.700
Unfortunately, the helicopter
carrying the reinforcements

50:34.866 --> 50:37.119
never reached the scene.

50:37.285 --> 50:41.873
It crashed after being struck
by a rocket-propelled grenade.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.710
And in the end more Americans
died in Afghanistan

50:44.876 --> 50:47.879
on June 28th, 2005,
than on any other day

50:48.046 --> 50:51.466
since the beginning
of Operation Enduring Freedom.

50:51.633 --> 50:56.430
This day of tragedy
also has the sad distinction

50:56.596 --> 51:00.142
of being the deadliest
for Navy Special Warfare Forces

51:00.308 --> 51:02.894
since World War ll.

51:03.061 --> 51:05.522
One of Michael's fellow SEALs
did make it off the mountain ridge.

51:05.689 --> 51:08.316
He was one of Michael's
closest friends,

51:08.483 --> 51:11.445
Petty Officer Marcus Luttrell
of Texas,

51:11.611 --> 51:14.448
author of a riveting book
called "Lone Survivor."

51:14.614 --> 51:18.618
"Put it this way--
Mikey was the best officer I ever knew.

51:18.785 --> 51:21.246
An iron-souled warrior

51:21.413 --> 51:25.167
of colossal and almost unbelievable
courage in the face of the enemy."

51:25.333 --> 51:27.252
Daniel:
When I was told about it,

51:27.419 --> 51:30.797
that Michael's final words were,
"Thank you, sir,"

51:30.964 --> 51:32.841
or, "Roger that. Thank you, sir,"

51:33.008 --> 51:35.719
Maureen and I looked at each other,
we were not surprised.

51:35.886 --> 51:39.014
Everything about Mike,
his whole life led up to that.

51:39.181 --> 51:43.143
He, you know, led his whole life
with honor, so...

51:48.648 --> 51:50.859
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

51:51.026 --> 51:53.028
I mean, we knew it.

51:54.696 --> 51:57.324
It was his sacrifice.

52:07.709 --> 52:09.544
Velez: Leaving high school,
I knew

52:09.711 --> 52:13.256
that college was gonna be
a big issue financially.

52:13.423 --> 52:15.884
I knew that if I wanted to go,
I would have to apply myself.

52:16.051 --> 52:17.886
And wanting, you know--
having the desire to go

52:18.053 --> 52:19.679
and having the grades to go
are one thing,

52:19.846 --> 52:22.057
but there are very tangible things
that you must have

52:22.224 --> 52:23.725
in order to continue
that goal.

52:23.892 --> 52:27.938
So in my senior year of high school,
I actually applied to 49 scholarships.

52:28.104 --> 52:32.108
Yes. Knowing that,
I only received eight.

52:32.275 --> 52:33.985
However, those eight
have been a blessing.

52:34.152 --> 52:37.405
And those eight have been able
to sustain my entire college career.

52:40.033 --> 52:43.995
The last time I saw Michael
was on Easter Sunday that year, 2005.

52:44.162 --> 52:48.083
And, you know,
we were all set to say goodbye.

52:48.250 --> 52:49.751
And I said to him,
"Bye, Mike."

52:49.918 --> 52:51.628
And he said, "Mama,
you never say goodbye to me."

52:51.795 --> 52:53.755
And I said,
"I don't know why I said that."

52:53.922 --> 52:55.423
I said, "Oh, don't pay
attention to me."

52:55.590 --> 52:58.677
But then he said goodbye to everybody
else and he told Kelly and John,

52:58.844 --> 53:01.096
he said, "Oh, I'll see you." And they
said, "Yeah, we'll see you," like that.

53:01.263 --> 53:03.014
So I didn't think
anything more about it.

53:03.181 --> 53:07.185
I pick him up
and I take him to the airport.

53:07.352 --> 53:08.812
And we're driving to the airport.

53:08.979 --> 53:10.480
We're talking about
a hundred different things.

53:10.647 --> 53:13.233
And I said, "Oh, God," I said,
"Michael, please do me a favor,

53:13.400 --> 53:17.112
call and let us know
that you got home to Hawaii safe."

53:17.279 --> 53:18.989
Maureen: And I said,
"Hey, Mike, do me a favor,

53:19.155 --> 53:22.200
when you get out to Hawaii,
make sure you give me a call back."

53:22.367 --> 53:25.996
You know, 'cause we-- I just want to
make sure that he gets home okay.

53:26.162 --> 53:28.790
So in the meantime,
he never did call.

53:28.957 --> 53:31.626
(thumps, whirrs)

53:39.009 --> 53:42.804
Maureen: We were told when he was
gonna come to the United States.

53:42.971 --> 53:45.515
And Danny and I decided
to go down to Dover.

53:45.682 --> 53:50.270
Maureen and I wanted to meet Michael
when he returned to US soil.

53:50.437 --> 53:53.732
They took him
out of the plane.

53:53.899 --> 53:58.194
And they took him down
on this big--

53:58.361 --> 54:00.238
it was almost like a carrier

54:00.405 --> 54:03.867
that comes up to the height
of the plane to take the casket.

54:04.034 --> 54:06.161
As the casket came down

54:06.328 --> 54:09.331
and it went down--
all the way down to the ground,

54:09.497 --> 54:13.001
I could picture Michael coming
in his white uniform towards us.

54:13.168 --> 54:16.338
I could just picture him, 'cause he
was-- one foot turned in a little bit.

54:16.504 --> 54:18.506
And I could picture him
walking over to us.

54:18.673 --> 54:21.217
When it hit the ground
at about the length of the time

54:21.384 --> 54:24.054
that it could have taken him
to walk over to us,

54:24.220 --> 54:26.681
there was this warmth,

54:26.848 --> 54:28.767
honest to God.

54:28.934 --> 54:31.102
And it was almost like a hug
from him.

54:31.269 --> 54:33.146
And I looked down
and I looked

54:33.313 --> 54:34.981
and everybody felt
the same reaction.

54:35.148 --> 54:36.983
And we all--
it was, like, calm.

54:37.150 --> 54:39.319
And I remember
we all looked at each other

54:39.486 --> 54:41.279
and I said,
"Did you feel that?"

54:41.446 --> 54:43.323
And everybody--
my brother-in-law,

54:43.490 --> 54:45.825
my sister-in-law,
Dan, John--

54:45.992 --> 54:48.703
we all felt it.
It was like this warm,

54:48.870 --> 54:51.581
like, calm that came over.

54:51.748 --> 54:54.709
All the way home,
we were just calm.

54:54.876 --> 54:56.920
I wanted to ride with my son.

54:57.087 --> 54:59.089
It was his last trip home.

54:59.255 --> 55:03.718
So I told Maureen that I would ride
in the hearse with Michael.

55:03.885 --> 55:07.430
And she rode in--

55:07.597 --> 55:09.975
her uncle provided a limousine.

55:10.141 --> 55:12.560
She rode with the family
right behind us.

55:12.727 --> 55:15.647
And we drove.

55:15.814 --> 55:19.734
Maryland, we had, like,
a two-police-car escort.

55:19.901 --> 55:23.113
And then New Jersey,
the New Jersey troopers met us

55:23.279 --> 55:26.157
and they were
a two-car escort.

55:26.324 --> 55:30.036
And we get to the Verrazano Bridge.
And at the Verrazano Bridge--

55:30.203 --> 55:33.748
only Commissioner Kelly
of New York City, you know?

55:33.915 --> 55:35.917
New York City
always seems to do it

55:36.084 --> 55:38.086
bigger and better
than everybody else.

55:38.253 --> 55:41.089
Every town stopped traffic,

55:41.256 --> 55:44.342
had police standing on the corner
saluting him.

55:44.509 --> 55:46.928
When we came over the bridges
coming back,

55:47.095 --> 55:49.472
the Belt Parkway was
completely shut down.

55:49.639 --> 55:52.434
Every stop,
those officers would be there

55:52.600 --> 55:54.894
blocking the traffic
so they couldn't get through

55:55.061 --> 55:57.480
and saluting his casket
coming past.

55:57.647 --> 55:59.441
I will never forget that
as long as I live.

55:59.607 --> 56:02.819
Remember, this is before we knew
anything about the battle,

56:02.986 --> 56:05.113
anything of his courage
or what he did.

56:05.280 --> 56:08.742
He was just a Navy SEAL
being returned home.

56:08.908 --> 56:10.785
They close down
the Belt Parkway

56:10.952 --> 56:12.996
and there is a New York City
police officer

56:13.163 --> 56:16.750
who salutes Michael
as he goes by.

56:16.916 --> 56:19.586
And I turned,
I put my hand on the casket

56:19.753 --> 56:22.464
and I just said, "Michael,"
I said, "this is all for you.

56:22.630 --> 56:24.049
And you deserve it."

56:24.215 --> 56:26.176
One of the things I'm proud of is,
as first responders,

56:26.342 --> 56:28.261
we take care of each other
as best we can.

56:28.428 --> 56:30.430
And it was nice to know

56:30.597 --> 56:34.809
that they accepted Mike
and his sacrifice

56:34.976 --> 56:37.479
as one of the local guys.
And they went out of their way--

56:37.645 --> 56:39.981
The police department, the fire
department-- everybody turned out.

56:40.148 --> 56:42.150
Owen: Volunteer or paid,
everybody came together

56:42.317 --> 56:46.237
and did everything they could
to try to make the situation

56:46.404 --> 56:50.325
as easy or as bearable
for Dan and Maureen as possible.

56:50.492 --> 56:53.453
Daniel: At the funeral,
they filled the church.

56:53.620 --> 56:57.248
The church holds, like,
I think, 2000-2500 people.

56:57.415 --> 56:59.209
The church was filled.
And they were outside.

56:59.375 --> 57:02.170
It was raining too, so everybody
was standing out in the rain.

57:02.337 --> 57:04.214
Maureen:
It was pouring rain.

57:04.380 --> 57:08.593
And I remember getting into
the limousine and looking out,

57:08.760 --> 57:11.179
and I saw these men

57:11.346 --> 57:14.182
that obviously served
in World War ll or Korea--

57:14.349 --> 57:17.519
old men--
standing at attention

57:17.685 --> 57:22.398
and saluting him all the way
down the street out of Kings Park.

57:22.565 --> 57:25.360
You know, everybody is still
in a kind of shock at the same time.

57:25.527 --> 57:27.362
You know, you're going
through the motions

57:27.529 --> 57:30.031
and you're,
you know, realizing,

57:30.198 --> 57:32.033
but yet not realizing
what's going on,

57:32.200 --> 57:33.993
because you just don't
want to believe that it's happened.

57:34.160 --> 57:36.955
I'll never forget
them wheeling the casket

57:37.122 --> 57:39.040
down the middle of the church.

57:39.207 --> 57:42.335
And it came time
to go right past me,

57:42.502 --> 57:44.712
and that was--

57:44.879 --> 57:47.340
that was the hardest I've cried
in my life.

57:47.507 --> 57:51.052
I'd never felt that before,
because it wasn't a sadness for me.

57:51.219 --> 57:54.222
It wasn't a pity thing.
It was-- I--

57:54.389 --> 57:58.434
my heart was broken
for another being and another family.

57:58.601 --> 58:00.478
And I didn't know
what to do with myself.

58:00.645 --> 58:05.358
The fact that he--
that he wasn't there anymore,

58:05.525 --> 58:07.735
that he paid
the ultimate sacrifice,

58:07.902 --> 58:11.072
just killed me,
absolutely killed me.

58:11.239 --> 58:13.241
When we left
the funeral home,

58:13.408 --> 58:16.661
the Suffolk Police Department
provided

58:16.828 --> 58:18.830
- a motorcycle escort in the rain...
- An escort in the rain.

58:18.997 --> 58:20.874
...with a couple other
departments as well.

58:21.040 --> 58:24.127
When they approached
the entrance to Calverton,

58:24.294 --> 58:26.421
the local fire departments
got together

58:26.588 --> 58:28.464
and set up ladder trucks

58:28.631 --> 58:31.092
and hung tremendous...

58:31.259 --> 58:32.802
- Huge American flags.
- ...American flags

58:32.969 --> 58:35.430
from the top of the ladder trucks
over the roadway.

58:35.597 --> 58:37.682
Keenan:
Brings back memories now.

58:37.849 --> 58:40.185
You know, I can kind of picture
the flags waving.

58:40.351 --> 58:42.729
The engine trucks--
the fire engine trucks-- it was--

58:42.896 --> 58:45.940
it was--
it was awesome, really.

58:46.107 --> 58:48.318
Daniel: We all park
and there's a private service--

58:48.484 --> 58:50.486
the O'Callaghans
and Michael's friends

58:50.653 --> 58:52.947
and really tight Navy--

58:53.114 --> 58:56.075
an aide had come.
They lift out Michael

58:56.242 --> 58:58.536
and they bring him over
to his gravesite and put him down.

58:58.703 --> 59:01.164
And there's a short service
by Father Coyle there.

59:01.331 --> 59:04.667
And we--
the service ends,

59:04.834 --> 59:06.961
and Maureen and I and John,
we turn

59:07.128 --> 59:09.547
and we are heading back
to the car,

59:09.714 --> 59:11.966
which is literally
50 feet away.

59:12.133 --> 59:15.094
And we just leave Mike.
We were the last two to leave.

59:15.261 --> 59:17.138
We turn around
and we head back.

59:17.305 --> 59:20.767
And Maureen's phone goes off.
And I remember it so vividly.

59:20.934 --> 59:24.145
She says, "Who would be
calling me now?

59:24.312 --> 59:25.855
They all know
we're at a funeral."

59:26.022 --> 59:28.983
I look down
and my cell phone's going off.

59:29.150 --> 59:32.779
And so I look at my cell,
I open it up.

59:32.946 --> 59:36.032
And then I see tears
welling up in her eyes.

59:36.199 --> 59:39.369
And my first thought was,
"Oh, she got more bad news. What?"

59:39.535 --> 59:41.412
And I said,
"Maureen, are you okay?"

59:41.579 --> 59:45.250
And she can't speak.
And she just hands me the phone.

59:45.416 --> 59:47.293
And I look at the phone

59:47.460 --> 59:51.881
and it's a message from Michael
that says,

59:52.048 --> 59:55.051
"Mama, home safe and sound.
Love, Mike."

59:55.218 --> 59:57.345
And in it, it says,

59:57.512 --> 59:59.472
"Mama, home safe and sound."

59:59.639 --> 01:00:04.352
And I thought, "Oh, my God,"
you know, that's a gift,

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:06.354
knowing that your child--

01:00:06.521 --> 01:00:10.191
temporarily you won't see him,
but he's okay.

01:00:10.358 --> 01:00:14.862
Now remember, we're in July--
July 13th now, he's being buried.

01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:17.657
The message
on March 31st was,

01:00:17.824 --> 01:00:20.702
"Mama, got home
safe and sound," to Hawaii.

01:00:20.868 --> 01:00:22.328
"Love, Mike."

01:00:22.495 --> 01:00:25.873
But we get the message from Michael
after we leave the gravesite,

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.875
saying, "Mama,
home safe and sound."

01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:29.502
And now of course
Maureen says

01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:32.505
that's Mike letting her know
that he's okay.

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:37.343
I don't know why--
why it chose

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:41.055
to come at that
particular point,

01:00:41.222 --> 01:00:43.308
just after we've left
the gravesite

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:45.184
and before we get
to our car,

01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:47.478
where we've just said goodbye
to our son

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:50.273
and we're going back,
and Maureen gets this message.

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:12.795
Daniel: I guess it was
about the last week in August, I think,

01:01:12.962 --> 01:01:14.839
I get a call
from the White House

01:01:15.006 --> 01:01:17.592
from President Bush's
military liaison

01:01:17.759 --> 01:01:20.970
to indicate that Michael's being awarded
the Medal of Honor.

01:01:21.137 --> 01:01:24.640
My dad came here
as, you know, an immigrant.

01:01:24.807 --> 01:01:27.643
And he was just ready to burst,

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.188
'cause he was like,
"I'm here in the White House,

01:01:30.355 --> 01:01:33.024
and my grandson is receiving
the Medal of Honor."

01:01:33.191 --> 01:01:34.942
But it's typical that he gets
the Medal of Honor,

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:37.070
just 'cause he's
such an amazing person.

01:01:37.236 --> 01:01:40.573
You know,
it's an outstanding feat

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.117
that he got that.
It's unbelievable.

01:01:43.284 --> 01:01:45.995
President Bush was so gracious.
He let us come into the--

01:01:46.162 --> 01:01:48.539
he wanted to meet us--
into the Oval Office.

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:50.917
We present him
with Michael's dog tags

01:01:51.084 --> 01:01:52.293
and he says,
"Thank you very much."

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:56.297
Dan and I had given him,
like, gold-plated dog tags.

01:01:56.464 --> 01:02:00.468
And he actually put them on, and
I'm looking, like, "What's he doing?"

01:02:00.635 --> 01:02:04.180
And I can tell the same thoughts
going in both our heads--

01:02:04.347 --> 01:02:07.100
"Why is the president getting
undressed in the Oval Office?"

01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:09.143
Maureen: He said that Mike
was "next to my heart."

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:10.895
I thought that was so nice.

01:02:11.062 --> 01:02:13.314
Daniel: And he gives Maureen
a hug and a kiss

01:02:13.481 --> 01:02:14.857
and he gives me a hug.

01:02:15.024 --> 01:02:16.943
And he says to us,
which was really cool--

01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:19.862
he goes, "Murphs, you did good."
He said, "But you know what?"

01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:21.906
He said, "I gotta tell you,
I did better."

01:02:22.073 --> 01:02:23.950
He said...
( quavers )

01:02:24.117 --> 01:02:26.661
"I had Michael
right next to my heart."

01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:33.626
As soon as I was charged
with writing that speech,

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:36.170
Michael Murphy popped into my head.
He was still fresh in my mind.

01:02:36.337 --> 01:02:38.965
And even in my dorm room,
I had a picture of him on my wall.

01:02:39.132 --> 01:02:42.385
As I started to get to know and
research more about Michael Murphy,

01:02:42.552 --> 01:02:44.554
I started to see a lot
of parallels in our lives.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.514
I mean, we only grew up
15 minutes from each other.

01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:49.058
His dad was a DA.
My father worked in law enforcement.

01:02:49.225 --> 01:02:52.562
He was a lifeguard over the summers.
I was a camp counselor over the summers.

01:02:52.728 --> 01:02:54.355
He had a heart
and a passion for people

01:02:54.522 --> 01:02:56.524
that drove him into
the Navy SEALs.

01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:58.317
And I have a similar heart
and passion for people

01:02:58.484 --> 01:02:59.861
that has driven me
towards medicine.

01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:01.904
That morning

01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:06.200
one of the staff call us

01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:10.288
and say, "We have a surprise.
Hector was selected."

01:03:10.455 --> 01:03:14.625
And I-- we were floored.
We were very proud to hear that.

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:18.212
And my husband and I decided that
we were not gonna share that with him.

01:03:18.379 --> 01:03:20.423
And my parents said,
"Hey, I think there's something

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:22.800
that's gonna be going on."
And they gave me an inkling of it,

01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:24.677
but I didn't really know
what was going on.

01:03:24.844 --> 01:03:26.846
I just knew that something special
was gonna happen that night.

01:03:29.307 --> 01:03:32.351
- ( cheering, applause )
-( band playing march music )

01:03:45.781 --> 01:03:49.327
Linda: It was surreal.
It was just unbelievable

01:03:49.494 --> 01:03:52.663
to see this big object.
And we saw how it was being built--

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.249
it was done in sections--
when we went up to Maine.

01:03:55.416 --> 01:03:58.336
And just looking up
at this huge thing

01:03:58.503 --> 01:04:00.963
and response for him.

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:04.258
Daniel: There were, like,
15 or 16 family members and stuff.

01:04:04.425 --> 01:04:06.677
We turn and we look up

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:09.388
and there's Michael's name

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:12.558
in huge block letters--

01:04:12.725 --> 01:04:14.602
"Michael Murphy."

01:04:14.769 --> 01:04:19.315
And it literally stopped me dead,
I mean just-- whew.

01:04:23.486 --> 01:04:26.364
They had to pick a warship,
to name it after Murphy, for sure.

01:04:26.531 --> 01:04:30.910
I'm sure Michael--
I'm sure he's upstairs in heaven, going,

01:04:31.077 --> 01:04:33.621
"Man, you guys are making--
this is way too big a deal for me."

01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:36.791
And he's probably thinking,
"I'm a team guy."

01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:38.876
One of the purposes,
the fact that's also a defense ship,

01:04:39.043 --> 01:04:41.671
you know, for protecting the country
and its assets,

01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:43.714
like, the idea that this is,
you know--

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:45.883
all the responsibilities
and all the things

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:48.344
that this ship represents,
and that it's named after him.

01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:50.888
Our kids
are gonna read about

01:04:51.055 --> 01:04:53.015
and learn in history

01:04:53.182 --> 01:04:54.976
that my cousin, or brother,

01:04:55.142 --> 01:04:57.019
was-- is part of history.

01:04:57.186 --> 01:04:59.313
O'Shea: It's added
to the great Navy tradition

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.524
of naming our warships
after heroes.

01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:04.402
And I couldn't think
of a better guy or a better candidate

01:05:04.569 --> 01:05:07.113
for a warship to be named after
than Michael.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.407
Mike would never want
a ship named after him.

01:05:09.574 --> 01:05:12.118
If it was up to Mike,
he would have every name

01:05:12.285 --> 01:05:14.870
that ever served in the military
on the side of a ship other than his.

01:05:15.037 --> 01:05:18.583
If he could actually fit every name,
he would definitely do that.

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:21.294
It was important to us
as a family

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.380
that the ship,
while it's named after Michael,

01:05:24.547 --> 01:05:26.424
embodies the spirit

01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:29.635
of 19 really brave heroes.

01:05:29.802 --> 01:05:31.512
That would have been
important to Michael,

01:05:31.679 --> 01:05:33.931
that, you know,
"This is about my team.

01:05:34.098 --> 01:05:38.311
I didn't operate in a vacuum,
and therefore

01:05:38.477 --> 01:05:41.689
you remember me best
by remembering my men."

01:05:48.529 --> 01:05:50.281
( Silent )

01:05:51.282 --> 01:05:54.577
Palmer: In thinking about all the things
that are being named after him,

01:05:54.744 --> 01:05:58.414
on one hand, I'd say,
you know...

01:05:58.581 --> 01:06:01.459
it's amazing,
but it's not enough.

01:06:01.626 --> 01:06:05.254
I'm sure Mr. and Mrs. Murphy
would still rather have their son back.

01:06:05.421 --> 01:06:07.381
I know I'd rather have
my friend back.

01:06:07.548 --> 01:06:09.717
But it's nice

01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:11.719
in this age

01:06:11.886 --> 01:06:15.348
of the venerating
of celebrities

01:06:15.514 --> 01:06:18.184
and people that have contributed
nothing to this world,

01:06:18.351 --> 01:06:21.937
the fact that someone
like Michael Murphy,

01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:24.982
who is such

01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:28.653
a ridiculously unbelievable
individual,

01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:33.324
now has people looking up
to someone like him.

01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:36.744
When I see the pictures of little boys
going to visit his gravesite,

01:06:36.911 --> 01:06:39.789
whether it be his namesake
or things of that nature--

01:06:39.955 --> 01:06:41.832
you know, hallelujah.

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:44.585
Because he's the type of person
that people should look up to,

01:06:44.752 --> 01:06:46.420
that they should
name things after.

01:06:54.929 --> 01:06:56.764
Velez: When I got to
the awards dinner,

01:06:56.931 --> 01:06:59.684
there were, I believe, four or five
other scholarship recipients

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.603
for the Suffolk Federal
Credit Union scholarship.

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:04.355
So we were all there.
We were all great.

01:07:04.522 --> 01:07:07.108
I was just honored to be within--
to be chosen to be a part of it

01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:10.194
and to be among these other top
high school seniors from Long Island.

01:07:10.361 --> 01:07:12.988
One of Michael's
favorite sayings was,

01:07:13.155 --> 01:07:14.949
"Education will set you free."

01:07:15.116 --> 01:07:18.953
And I said, "I can't think
of any way better

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.790
to remember Michael's legacy,
or tribute"--

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:25.835
'cause remember, this is well--
long before the Medal of Honor--

01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:29.380
is to have a scholarship
foundation

01:07:29.547 --> 01:07:32.675
where we can offer scholarships
to deserving people.

01:07:32.842 --> 01:07:35.553
And while we were there,
they started to announce

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.306
that there would be an inaugural
scholarship in Michael Murphy's honor.

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:42.101
There's a certain criteria.
They have to be team players.

01:07:42.268 --> 01:07:45.229
They have to play in sports,
you know, keep their grades up.

01:07:45.396 --> 01:07:47.398
The kid that is--
has his nose to the books,

01:07:47.565 --> 01:07:49.900
that is working every day
to better himself,

01:07:50.067 --> 01:07:52.319
that is a well-rounded kid,

01:07:52.486 --> 01:07:54.739
not a kid who's solely focused
on academics,

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:57.616
because you have to be
well-rounded.

01:07:57.783 --> 01:08:00.035
You have to have interests
in the arts or sports

01:08:00.202 --> 01:08:02.163
or, you know,
community events.

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:04.540
That's the kid that's gonna
get that award.

01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:06.667
But when they announced
my name, I was--

01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:08.377
I was shocked. I was floored.

01:08:08.544 --> 01:08:10.671
I was proud. I was happy.

01:08:10.838 --> 01:08:12.840
And then it all started to sink in.

01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:14.717
When I started to realize
it was his name

01:08:14.884 --> 01:08:17.511
and who it was for
and who it represented,

01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:19.930
I realized it was more than
just a check and a pat on the back,

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.725
but it was an honor.
It was a legacy that I was given.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:34.444
Daniel:
You look at a man

01:08:34.612 --> 01:08:38.741
who has probably dove to depths
that are classified and nobody knows,

01:08:38.908 --> 01:08:42.495
jumped out of planes at heights
on oxygen, you know,

01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:44.537
doing HALOs or whatever--

01:08:44.705 --> 01:08:46.457
you know, so he did it all,
you know.

01:08:46.624 --> 01:08:50.419
And I think in my mind
and my heart

01:08:50.586 --> 01:08:54.089
at least I know that he lived
a really full life.

01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:56.966
People should
remember him just--

01:08:57.134 --> 01:08:59.595
I know everybody knows
as a great guy,

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:02.180
but Mike would have done
anything for anybody.

01:09:02.348 --> 01:09:04.725
He would have been there for you
no matter what,

01:09:04.892 --> 01:09:06.727
any type of weather.

01:09:06.894 --> 01:09:10.022
He-- I don't know.
It's kind of hard to put into words

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:11.941
why people should
remember Mike,

01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:15.653
but Mike is just the greatest guy
I've ever met in my whole life.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:18.906
I guess what I would
tell him is that,

01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:21.158
knowing him so much as a child,

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:25.162
I regret that I didn't get to spend
more time with him as an adult.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.497
Giving myself over to others
is something

01:09:27.665 --> 01:09:30.501
that from my parents has been ingrained,
from my family it's been ingrained,

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:32.711
and from Michael Murphy,
it just solidified it even more.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:35.089
He gave me that opportunity,
and it's my chance

01:09:35.256 --> 01:09:37.633
and my opportunity
to go forth with it.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.261
So, I mean, it had to be
when Michael was, I guess, about 12

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.971
and we were down two runs.
It was the ninth inning.

01:09:43.138 --> 01:09:45.474
And he hits a home run.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.644
And he wins the game.

01:09:50.104 --> 01:09:53.899
And comes around
the bases...

01:09:56.902 --> 01:09:59.613
and all those boys

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:03.200
literally surround him,

01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:05.244
you know,
the way they normally do,

01:10:05.411 --> 01:10:08.497
because they won the game.
It was important.

01:10:08.664 --> 01:10:11.083
And they're jumping around

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:14.503
and telling Michael,

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:17.172
"Michael, you won the game.
You won the game."

01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:19.216
( quavering )
And it was funny--

01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:22.344
Michael turns around to them
and says,

01:10:22.511 --> 01:10:25.973
"I didn't win the game.
This was a team sport."

01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:29.143
And he said,
"if you hadn't got on base,

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:31.312
if you hadn't got on base

01:10:31.478 --> 01:10:34.523
for me to hit the hit
that scored the runs,

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:36.191
we wouldn't have won
the game."

01:10:36.358 --> 01:10:38.694
That particular game

01:10:38.861 --> 01:10:41.864
was so like him,
you know.

01:10:42.031 --> 01:10:46.869
And it was just
a microcosm of his life.

01:10:47.036 --> 01:10:49.246
It was always--
it was never about him.

01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:53.334
It was always about
his teammates, his men.

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.669
And so that's why

01:10:55.836 --> 01:10:58.339
when things happened
like they happened on that mountain,

01:10:58.505 --> 01:11:00.257
it didn't surprise
Maureen and I at all.

01:11:00.424 --> 01:11:02.468
I'd say thank you.

01:11:02.635 --> 01:11:05.262
- I'm a better person for knowing Mike.
- Absolutely.

01:11:05.429 --> 01:11:07.765
I think all of us,

01:11:07.932 --> 01:11:09.808
you know, were blessed
to have him in our lives.

01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:11.477
I'd thank him for every day,

01:11:11.644 --> 01:11:13.687
- every second I had with him.
- We're gonna miss him.

01:11:13.854 --> 01:11:15.606
- Owen: Definitely.
- Jessica: Absolutely.

01:11:15.773 --> 01:11:17.691
Owen: I'd give anything
to have him back,

01:11:17.858 --> 01:11:20.027
but I wouldn't trade anything
for what we had.

He kind of just--
he was okay with--

not that he never feared
the consequences.

01:13:38.707 --> 01:13:41.627
He was okay
with the consequences.

01:13:41.794 --> 01:13:43.879
You know,
this is the guy that--

01:13:44.046 --> 01:13:46.840
that driving back to Penn State,

01:13:47.007 --> 01:13:49.510
and instead of figuring out
a way for another ride,

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:51.053
he just wanted to go with me,

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.846
even though I already had
someone going with me.

01:13:53.013 --> 01:13:56.767
And he just decided to lie down
in the bed of my pickup truck

01:13:56.934 --> 01:13:58.936
for the entire trip
back to Penn State.

01:13:59.103 --> 01:14:01.313
Now, I mean,

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.149
if anything goes wrong,
he's in trouble.

01:14:04.316 --> 01:14:06.026
And that was clearly
spelled out to him.

01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:08.195
He said, "Don't worry about it.
I'll be fine."

01:14:08.362 --> 01:14:11.782
And that was just--
that was just how he was.

01:14:11.949 --> 01:14:14.618
( laughs )
I mean--

01:14:14.785 --> 01:14:16.036
- Mactavish: I never heard that.
- Yeah, just lying--

01:14:16.203 --> 01:14:18.038
I mean, that's a 300-mile trip.

01:14:18.205 --> 01:14:21.375
And it's not from San Diego
to Los Angeles.

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:24.670
We're talking in the dead of winter,
going to Penn State,

01:14:24.837 --> 01:14:27.214
he's just lying down
in the bed of a pickup truck.

01:14:27.381 --> 01:14:29.383
And I don't know if his mom
knows that story, so...

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.635
( laughs )

01:14:39.434 --> 01:14:42.312
Man: CrossFit gyms recently participated
in a nationwide workout

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:45.190
to honor fallen heroes
and raise money for military charities

01:14:45.357 --> 01:14:47.067
such as the Navy SEAL
Foundation.

01:14:47.234 --> 01:14:50.821
The annual event honored fallen
Navy SEAL Lieutenant Michael Murphy.

01:14:50.988 --> 01:14:54.032
It was just a good cause.
It just brought a lot of camaraderie

01:14:54.199 --> 01:14:57.619
with just the military
and just kind of really honoring

01:14:57.786 --> 01:14:59.788
the fallen heroes
that died for our country.

01:14:59.955 --> 01:15:03.750
Our owners Jake and John
are former Navy SEALs,

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:07.004
and so they're very big on giving back
to the Navy SEAL Foundation.

01:15:07.171 --> 01:15:09.590
Man: The workout was
one of many events that are put on

01:15:09.756 --> 01:15:12.217
by the CrossFit community each year
to support the military.

01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:15.137
CrossFit East Village is
a huge military community.

01:15:15.304 --> 01:15:17.639
A lot of our members
are actually part of the military.

01:15:17.806 --> 01:15:19.433
Murph, you're a stud.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.810
A huge inspiration for all of us
in the CrossFit community.

01:15:21.977 --> 01:15:24.313
A hero, a real hero

01:15:24.479 --> 01:15:27.983
