Rough night?

01:58.745 --> 01:59.579
What?

02:00.455 --> 02:03.666
I said, did you have a rough night?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.464
You and I are gonna have a talk.

02:15.261 --> 02:17.847
You told Mr. Potts
that you saw me in Miami.

02:19.766 --> 02:21.851
And you told Eric O'Bannon
the same thing?

02:24.228 --> 02:25.063
Yeah.

02:30.109 --> 02:32.153
Your dad was in bad shape.

02:33.905 --> 02:36.616
What you saw was me and Kevin
trying to help him.

02:38.785 --> 02:39.661
Okay.

02:39.786 --> 02:43.873
I don't know what Eric O'Bannon told you,
but he's not your friend.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.668
He dragged your dad down his whole life,

02:46.751 --> 02:48.628
and he's gonna do the same thing to you.

02:50.088 --> 02:54.509
You know we have him in custody
for parole violation right now, don't you?

02:57.678 --> 02:58.513
Good.

03:06.813 --> 03:09.148
My dad really never told you about me?

03:13.694 --> 03:14.570
No.

03:19.992 --> 03:23.788
Your dad may not have been a good father,
but he was not a bad guy.

03:24.872 --> 03:25.832
Right.

03:25.915 --> 03:28.126
I'm sure he meant to do
the right thing by you.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.924
Sometimes it's hard...
to do the right thing.

03:46.853 --> 03:48.479
- How's Kevin?
<i>- He left, John.</i>

03:48.563 --> 03:51.399
-<i>I tried to stop him. I'm so sorry.</i>
-The fuck you talking about, he left?

03:51.607 --> 03:52.984
-<i>Where?</i>
-I don't know. I don't know.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.027
I tried Belle's cell, I tried his cell.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.864
He said something about
trying to make things right with Lowry.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.032
-<i>Jesus, Meg.</i>
-Yeah, I don't know what he meant.

04:00.116 --> 04:02.368
But I don't have a car,
so I'm stuck in this shitty hotel.

04:02.452 --> 04:03.786
<i>You gotta go find him.</i>

04:04.662 --> 04:05.496
Kevin!

04:07.957 --> 04:08.875
Kevin!

04:13.546 --> 04:14.464
Kev.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.260
Son of a bitch.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.802
Hey.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.930
Oh, hey. Is this--?

05:04.013 --> 05:07.016
-Is this Wayne Lowry's house?
-Yeah, who the fuck are you?

05:07.225 --> 05:09.393
Hey, come on. No, no, no.
It's not like that.

05:09.644 --> 05:10.770
I-- I just--

05:11.270 --> 05:14.148
I-- I have something of his
that I-- I-- I need to return.

05:15.608 --> 05:17.026
Trust me, he's gonna want this.

05:20.738 --> 05:22.657
You're gonna wanna come out here.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.503
Fuck, Kevin.

05:36.254 --> 05:37.797
Fuck.

05:57.233 --> 06:00.194
When's it gonna end, John? Hmm?

06:19.589 --> 06:20.756
I made a mistake.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.509
You're Rayburn's brother.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.636
He doesn't know I'm here.

06:27.847 --> 06:29.056
Just take it, okay?

06:30.808 --> 06:32.310
Just-- Just take it.

06:35.271 --> 06:36.105
Okay?

06:41.110 --> 06:42.653
We're good now, right?

07:24.487 --> 07:25.696
Shit.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.909
No, no, no.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.160
Come on, come on.

07:36.707 --> 07:37.750
Fuck!

08:07.238 --> 08:08.656
Rayburn.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.076
Where?

08:22.211 --> 08:23.713
- Damien.
- John.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.550
He seems okay, he's just a little shaken.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.427
-Where is he?
-He's right over there.

08:30.094 --> 08:32.805
But, Detective...
we're gonna have to take him in.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.099
We found this.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.940
What you wanna do?

08:49.613 --> 08:50.823
Do what you have to do.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.587
They're gonna arrest you and take you in.

09:05.004 --> 09:08.674
And when they do, you're not
gonna say a goddamn word to anyone.

09:10.301 --> 09:11.719
I made things right with Lowry.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.513
I promise you,
you did not make things right.

09:47.797 --> 09:48.756
What's this?

09:49.298 --> 09:50.424
Three keys.

09:51.509 --> 09:52.843
Some of what we lost.

09:54.136 --> 09:57.264
We didn't lose it. You did.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.810
I found the guy
who put this on the street.

10:02.353 --> 10:05.940
-Give me his name.
-Well, he's useful to me at the moment.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.441
For what?

10:08.109 --> 10:10.402
I'm gonna be up and running again. Soon.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.030
Are you?

10:13.989 --> 10:16.033
I'm gonna finance a run myself.

10:16.534 --> 10:18.452
A good-faith investment.

10:19.328 --> 10:24.250
I'll use my people, there's no risk
for you, and you get the spoils.

10:27.128 --> 10:29.797
I can still make you money.

10:33.217 --> 10:37.346
Or you can have your boys
put a bullet in my head right now.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.515
You choose.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.352
Because at this point,
I hardly give a fuck.

10:48.983 --> 10:50.151
Okay, Wayne.

10:52.278 --> 10:53.320
One chance.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.551
He wants to know what--
What this deal means.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.556
It means that the man who's responsible
for your daughter's death

11:20.890 --> 11:22.141
is going to prison.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.438
Who is this man?

11:31.108 --> 11:32.985
He will go to prison for many years.

11:33.903 --> 11:38.198
He will never again do to any child
what he did to your daughter.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.512
This man...

12:03.307 --> 12:06.352
he killed your brother, no?

12:09.939 --> 12:11.190
Yes.

12:18.656 --> 12:21.158
He wants to know if you think
this deal is fair.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.828
If you think this is justice.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.045
It's our best option.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.298
If we could do something else, we would.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.152
Deal's still on the table.

13:39.528 --> 13:40.362
Don't need it.

13:44.033 --> 13:47.661
I ain't gonna lie.
I was in a jam with my people.

13:48.537 --> 13:52.875
But your little brother...
he bought me one more chance.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.503
What goes on right here
is between you and me.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.885
Oh, you've got a hell of a family.

14:03.343 --> 14:07.973
Kid brother dealing on the streets,
sister bribing witnesses,

14:08.182 --> 14:09.933
and then there's Danny.

14:12.061 --> 14:16.648
I made a mistake getting in bed
with him, but I didn't kill him.

14:18.442 --> 14:21.987
Maybe you've got more to hide
than I thought.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.743
You sure as hell don't want me
playing that tape for your friends.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.037
We had an understanding.

14:31.622 --> 14:33.624
You walked away from that understanding.

14:34.666 --> 14:39.922
So, why don't you tell me exactly
what the fuck is it we're doing here?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.593
I'm getting back into business...

14:46.136 --> 14:47.846
and you're gonna help me do it.

14:49.515 --> 14:50.724
I'm planning a run.

14:51.058 --> 14:56.355
I need information: Where the Feds
are looking, and where they're blind.

14:59.483 --> 15:02.486
And if I don't hear from you,
I tell my story.

15:03.779 --> 15:08.659
And I got nothing to lose...
so don't think I won't.

15:42.693 --> 15:45.487
He's really got you
in a corner, doesn't he?

15:46.822 --> 15:50.367
You're damned if you do,
you're damned if you don't.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.331
Story of my life.

16:04.756 --> 16:08.844
Yep. Fuck it. May as well light up.

16:13.932 --> 16:16.477
All right, now let's think this through.

16:20.439 --> 16:23.859
You can either do Lowry's bidding...

16:27.029 --> 16:31.492
or you can tell him to go fuck himself,
take your chances when he sings.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.627
What would you do?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.214
Doesn't matter.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.758
You're not me, right?

16:48.675 --> 16:51.929
If only there was another way
through this.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.145
Wait a minute. Yeah.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.484
Confession. Of course.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.905
Shit, that would take balls.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.783
Even I'd be impressed by that.

17:14.368 --> 17:16.828
But if you confess,
then everyone's gonna know.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.584
What will they know?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.005
John Rayburn's a lie.

18:26.982 --> 18:31.153
Mrs. Rayburn? There's a lady asking
for you. She's interested in a room.

18:32.195 --> 18:34.948
-Just show her around.
-She asked to see the owner.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.410
Okay, Manny, I'll be right there.

18:46.501 --> 18:47.586
May I help you?

18:49.171 --> 18:51.214
I heard this was a nice place.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.180
We like to think so.

19:01.350 --> 19:04.019
In town they said I should talk
to the lady of the house.

19:04.645 --> 19:08.148
Well, that's me, I guess. I'm Sally.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.866
Well, I'm looking for a place to stay.
I thought maybe you could show me around.

19:20.285 --> 19:24.122
Sure, sure. Follow me.
I'll give you the tour.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.753
Yeah, I got a really late start
this morning.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.048
No, actually, can you hold off?

19:33.131 --> 19:36.218
I really wanna take a look
at those samples before they go out.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.970
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Carla.

19:40.806 --> 19:41.682
Hi.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.936
You got home late last night.
You left early this morning.

19:46.019 --> 19:49.189
-Oh, it's work.
-Can I talk to you for a second?

19:51.608 --> 19:52.901
Yeah.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.071
Yeah.

19:56.822 --> 20:01.034
You know, I didn't...
say anything about it earlier, but...

20:01.993 --> 20:04.079
when Sally came by to see me...

20:06.164 --> 20:08.834
she said some things.

20:09.835 --> 20:12.713
You don't have to worry about anything.
I explained everything to her.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.339
It's fine.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.468
Listen, I know that when you
sent me away with the kids...

20:19.469 --> 20:21.430
that there were things you didn't tell me.

20:21.972 --> 20:23.473
I know that.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.476
Yes, there were.

20:27.436 --> 20:29.980
-Things that you still don't need to know.
-Okay.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.110
Did you go to Miami?

20:40.407 --> 20:41.491
Listen to me.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.912
I wanted Danny to leave,
just like you did. Just like you did.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.123
So I gave him a chance
to clean up his mess.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.208
-You gave him a chance.
-That's right.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.423
Even after what he did to our daughter?

20:57.340 --> 21:00.385
-Don't do that.
-I'm trying to understand.

21:00.594 --> 21:03.805
-What is it you're trying to understand?
-That you were so frightened

21:03.889 --> 21:05.932
you sent us away
but you still tried to help him.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.852
I didn't help him, though, did I?
And now he's dead!

21:09.728 --> 21:11.521
So, what the fuck does it matter?

21:21.490 --> 21:24.826
- We have daily boat trips.
- I love boats.

21:25.368 --> 21:29.414
We have snorkeling and fishing
and sunset cruises.

21:29.498 --> 21:32.793
We have 24-hour beach access
to all of our guests.

21:33.543 --> 21:34.961
What about the spa?

21:35.670 --> 21:37.589
Oh, we don't have a spa.

21:38.757 --> 21:41.885
-Oh.
-Sorry about that. We're, uh--

21:42.761 --> 21:44.054
We're a simple place.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.557
No, that's all right.

21:47.641 --> 21:50.685
You know, I'm kind of sick
of all those fancy places anyways.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.315
So, you run this place all by yourself?

21:56.233 --> 21:58.109
These days, I do.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.028
I have a staff, of course.

22:01.238 --> 22:05.200
I really admire that. Strong woman running
her own business, doing her own thing.

22:06.785 --> 22:09.454
Kind of independent that way, myself.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.123
What do you do?

22:12.624 --> 22:14.876
I'm a musician, mostly.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.212
-I'm a songwriter.
-Oh, well, that's nice.

22:18.088 --> 22:19.381
This is pretty much the place.

22:19.464 --> 22:24.970
If you want, we can stop by the office
and I can show you what's available.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.722
You don't know who I am, do you?

22:33.979 --> 22:36.106
It was a while ago.

22:36.815 --> 22:38.858
Sixteen years.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.577
- He's right down there.
- Thank you.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.788
You got 15 minutes.

23:06.845 --> 23:08.763
-Hey, I just want--
-I talked to John.

23:08.847 --> 23:11.933
He told me what happened, okay?
You don't need to tell me anything.

23:16.938 --> 23:18.398
Are you all right?

23:20.734 --> 23:22.902
The EMT said I was lucky.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.786
Have you talked to Belle?

23:32.495 --> 23:33.663
I called her.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.960
-What did she say?
-She's upset, Kevin.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.677
When am I gonna get out of here?

23:47.761 --> 23:51.348
Well, you'll be kept until your
bail hearing, so no longer than 72 hours.

23:52.515 --> 23:53.516
Three days?

23:54.017 --> 23:57.395
I'm trying to expedite it.
I might be able to get it through sooner.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.942
I'm gonna act as your lawyer.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.615
I'm not worried about the hearing.
I think it'll be pretty straightforward.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.576
But I thought you had to get back
to New York.

24:11.826 --> 24:16.206
Nah, I can... push it off
a few days if I have to.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.167
I should see Mom anyway.

24:20.085 --> 24:24.255
-I thought you said you didn't want to.
-I don't, but I should.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.095
Don't tell her about this, okay?

24:32.555 --> 24:35.266
Please, not yet. I-- I wanna do it myself.

24:41.022 --> 24:42.399
You sure you're all right?

24:45.652 --> 24:46.986
I don't know.

24:48.196 --> 24:50.615
Something's gotta change here, Meg.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.371
I have to get some real help.

25:02.752 --> 25:07.757
You know, I actually could use
a place to stay. For a night or two.

25:08.216 --> 25:12.220
Thank you.
But I don't think I can afford this place.

25:12.929 --> 25:14.806
Where's home for you?

25:14.973 --> 25:16.224
Panhandle.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.394
What brought you down here?

25:19.728 --> 25:21.271
I came for my son.

25:23.148 --> 25:26.151
-He told me you two had met.
-Yeah, we did.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.278
Looks like his dad, doesn't he?

25:31.281 --> 25:34.993
If you came for him,
why are you talking to me?

25:37.871 --> 25:41.082
Well, you know...

25:42.125 --> 25:47.130
Once I came down here,
it just seemed stupid not to come see you.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.758
Well, here I am.

25:51.176 --> 25:55.305
I'm sorry about Danny. About your loss.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.516
Thank you.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.188
I miss him too.

26:04.397 --> 26:07.567
Not that we were-- I mean,
we didn't have much of a relationship.

26:07.650 --> 26:12.781
Not for a while. But he'd come by
sometimes and see his kid, and...

26:14.073 --> 26:16.367
Every blue moon send some money.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.288
Well, that's nice.

26:20.371 --> 26:25.043
Well, it wasn't much to speak of,
but yeah, he tried sometimes.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.342
Raising a kid on my own...

26:32.926 --> 26:36.638
Kids are expensive. I mean,
I don't need to tell you that, but...

26:37.806 --> 26:39.432
I want Nolan to go to college.

26:40.809 --> 26:42.018
Of course.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.437
I know Danny really wanted that, too.

26:51.736 --> 26:53.947
Did you come here for money, Eve?

26:55.490 --> 26:57.408
I told you, I came for Nolan.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.834
But, yeah, it's not easy.

27:07.293 --> 27:11.047
You know, being cut off,
just like that, overnight.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.342
What do you mean, cut off?

27:15.343 --> 27:16.719
Uh...

27:18.721 --> 27:20.765
I wondered if you knew.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.065
I had an arrangement with your husband.

27:35.113 --> 27:36.364
Uh...

27:36.739 --> 27:38.157
Look, um--

27:40.118 --> 27:41.911
Eve, I--

27:44.455 --> 27:46.332
Thank you for coming.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.960
It was good to see you. But--

27:50.295 --> 27:52.297
I really do need to get back to work.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.931
Maybe I can call you again.

28:02.015 --> 28:04.767
Well. Well, we'll see. We'll see.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.562
You can just wait here.
Manny will get your car.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.565
-You must be the Tarlows.
-Yes, I'm Aaron.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.233
- Hi.
- This is my wife Tonya.

28:12.317 --> 28:14.027
Hi, I'm Sally Rayburn.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.029
So, I hear it's your first time
in the Keys.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.697
It is,
and this is absolutely lovely.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.741
Thank you, we think so.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.409
Well, we'll take care of your bags.

28:21.659 --> 28:25.121
Manny, you take care of the Tarlows
and then see that she gets her car?

28:26.497 --> 28:30.168
Well, let me give you a quick tour,
and then I'll find you both a drink.

28:30.251 --> 28:31.502
Terrific.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.436
I just saw Kevin.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.815
How is he?

28:54.025 --> 28:55.526
Not good.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.580
Wayne Lowry wants me
to do something for him,

29:07.664 --> 29:09.290
and I may not have a choice.

29:12.585 --> 29:13.753
Okay.

29:14.963 --> 29:20.343
He can say a lot of things
that we can't explain.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.638
I understand.

29:26.516 --> 29:28.518
If I don't do this for him...

29:32.814 --> 29:36.776
everything could unravel
and I may have to come clean.

29:38.486 --> 29:42.240
I want you to know that you and Kevin,
this will never touch either one of you.

29:42.323 --> 29:45.243
-This is on me, period.
-What are you gonna do?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.423
I need a promise from you.

30:00.508 --> 30:03.177
I need to know that Diana and the kids
are taken care of.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.556
I want my ownership of the inn
put in their name.

30:06.639 --> 30:09.892
I want every-- Everything goes
in their name. Will you do that for me?

30:09.976 --> 30:11.144
John, you're scaring me.

30:11.227 --> 30:14.480
I can't even talk to Diana
about any of this. I--

30:19.152 --> 30:21.988
I need to hear
that you'll do that for me, please.

30:27.618 --> 30:29.162
I'll take care of it.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.841
There's been a development.

30:41.924 --> 30:44.719
We figured something must've changed
for Lowry to back out of the deal,

30:44.802 --> 30:47.013
so we checked in with
a few of our old sources and,

30:47.096 --> 30:49.182
well, it looks like
we finally got some activity.

30:49.265 --> 30:50.266
It's good news.

30:50.933 --> 30:54.187
You, uh... mind if I sit in?

30:54.270 --> 30:55.313
Of course not.

30:55.688 --> 30:56.939
You deserve to be in the loop.

30:57.273 --> 30:59.567
Hell, you might be the next Sheriff
of Monroe County.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.236
- Maybe.
- We're hearing some chatter

31:02.320 --> 31:03.696
from our overseas people.

31:03.780 --> 31:06.366
There's indication a shipment
may be coming in later this week.

31:06.491 --> 31:09.285
- Is the intel reliable?
- Trying to corroborate it now.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.704
Do we have any idea
where the shipment's supposed to land?

31:11.788 --> 31:12.622
That's the problem.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.875
-Last time they were all over Big Pine.
-They have to know that's burnt.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.461
Probably, but we'll have eyes
down there just in case.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.631
I also flagged a few areas
where Lowry could bring in the shipment.

31:23.091 --> 31:26.386
I'm hoping you guys can come up
with some local sources.

31:26.511 --> 31:28.304
Maybe you can help us find
something we can't.

31:28.388 --> 31:30.306
Oh, you need us now?

31:31.099 --> 31:33.893
It's so nice to be loved. Right, John?

31:34.435 --> 31:35.478
Yeah.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.523
We're just keeping our ears open, guys.
I just want you to do the same.

31:38.731 --> 31:39.816
Of course.

31:54.997 --> 31:56.374
Hank?

32:04.382 --> 32:07.468
<i>Utility boat 3-7-7-9-2-0...</i>

32:07.635 --> 32:10.179
<i>reporting center damage west--</i>

32:11.055 --> 32:13.975
- <i>Heading northbound on--</i>
<i>- Utility 5-0-0--</i>

32:18.855 --> 32:19.814
Hank?

32:20.815 --> 32:24.068
-Don't shoot me.
-Hey, Johnny boy.

32:24.402 --> 32:26.404
-What's going on, man?
-Hi.

32:26.487 --> 32:28.656
I've been seeing your name
on signs all over town.

32:28.906 --> 32:30.158
How about that. Here.

32:33.661 --> 32:36.080
-You trying to buy my vote?
-Goddamn right I am.

32:40.835 --> 32:41.794
How's the leg?

32:41.878 --> 32:43.963
Better than it was in Afghanistan.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.135
I need some information.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.013
You're still on credit.
What can I do for you?

32:52.930 --> 32:57.101
I know you monitor the Coast Guard,
their patrols.

32:57.518 --> 32:59.187
Anything you can give me on that?

33:02.273 --> 33:03.900
Might have a few beads on routes.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.694
How about patrol schedules?

33:08.821 --> 33:10.823
John, can't you ask
the Coast Guard for this?

33:10.948 --> 33:12.742
I could, but I like you better.

33:22.418 --> 33:24.795
All right,
I can probably get you something.

33:24.879 --> 33:26.631
I also need some information.

33:26.714 --> 33:28.257
-About?
-Smuggling.

33:31.427 --> 33:32.345
It's been pretty quiet.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.514
Well, DEA says
they're hearing some noise overseas.

33:34.597 --> 33:38.976
They're looking for local entry points.
You been sourcing feds here?

33:40.102 --> 33:42.230
They-- They've been asking around, but--

33:43.731 --> 33:46.567
-You share anything with them?
-Had nothing to share.

33:46.776 --> 33:49.487
If you did hear anything, you...

33:51.197 --> 33:52.823
Come to me first, would you?

33:54.617 --> 33:55.785
Absolutely.

33:57.578 --> 33:59.539
I'm in no hurry to run to the feds, John.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.085
I've already served my country.

34:08.548 --> 34:11.175
Sheets? Everything?
Towels? You've got plenty of them?

34:11.259 --> 34:13.427
- I think so.
- Have them already.

34:13.886 --> 34:17.807
Been on it. So, a little snorkeling,
and some fishing.

34:18.516 --> 34:21.936
That's plenty of time to do everything.
You have to take the sunset cruise.

34:22.019 --> 34:27.567
Give you a bottle of wine and--
Excuse me. Meg? Meggy.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.610
Is that you, honey?

34:30.528 --> 34:33.823
-Hi, Mom.
-Oh, my gosh, let's look at you.

34:34.073 --> 34:35.616
You look tired, honey.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.124
-Are you eating?
-Yes, of course.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.503
Come on. I'm gonna take you in
and make you something to eat.

34:47.962 --> 34:49.505
Yeah, so I'm just down for a few days

34:49.589 --> 34:52.967
because I had to take care of some
of the stuff with selling the house, so...

34:56.429 --> 34:58.639
So you're in New York to stay, then?

34:59.140 --> 35:00.391
Yeah, Mom.

35:02.018 --> 35:03.227
I like it there.

35:05.605 --> 35:07.481
I missed you, Meg.

35:08.566 --> 35:10.610
I'm sorry, I should call you more.

35:10.693 --> 35:13.863
That's okay. I'm excited for you.

35:14.363 --> 35:16.324
If you're happy, I'm happy.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.243
How are you?

35:20.328 --> 35:23.080
Oh, you know.

35:28.753 --> 35:31.714
Danny had a son.

35:33.549 --> 35:35.926
Yeah. John told me. It's crazy.

35:46.020 --> 35:51.108
Are you, uh... familiar
with all your father's accounts?

35:53.986 --> 35:56.447
Uh, yeah.
You know I helped with that stuff.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.825
You think it's possible that...

36:00.618 --> 36:02.995
he had accounts
that you weren't aware of?

36:04.497 --> 36:06.499
I-- I don't know.
What are you asking me, Mom?

36:10.169 --> 36:14.423
There's a woman who says
your father was sending her money.

36:16.467 --> 36:17.927
I wanna know if it's true.

36:20.137 --> 36:21.180
What's her name?

36:21.305 --> 36:24.016
Evangeline Ro--

36:24.934 --> 36:27.978
Rossovich, I think.
Something like that. I don't know.

36:31.399 --> 36:34.485
-Who is that?
-So you've heard her name.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.156
Was he paying her?

36:40.866 --> 36:42.243
Mom.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.040
I didn't--

36:49.959 --> 36:53.462
The bank called me
because I was a trustee on the account...

36:54.088 --> 36:57.174
and they said that there were payments
going to some woman...

36:58.759 --> 37:00.261
that stopped when dad died,

37:00.344 --> 37:04.181
and they wanted to know
if I wanted to continue paying her.

37:04.724 --> 37:07.685
-And what did you say?
-I said no.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.396
You didn't ask who she was?

37:10.479 --> 37:14.150
No, I don't wanna know
why Dad was paying some strange woman.

37:16.777 --> 37:17.820
Why is that funny?

37:18.070 --> 37:20.281
You thought he was having an affair.

37:20.489 --> 37:24.535
-Yeah. I didn't know, but I thought maybe.
-Who knows?

37:24.618 --> 37:27.705
He could've been sleeping with half
the Keys, but he wasn't sleeping with her.

37:28.622 --> 37:29.915
Okay, well, then who is she?

37:31.167 --> 37:33.002
She's the boy's mother.

37:42.052 --> 37:45.639
Hi. Can you connect me
to Mr. Tarlow's bungalow, please?

37:51.145 --> 37:52.897
Hi, Mrs. Tarlow?

37:53.939 --> 37:58.319
Hey, I'm calling from the office
of the Rayburn House here.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.863
We've had a little problem
with your credit card.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.073
Can you confirm the number, please?

38:08.996 --> 38:10.414
Mm-hm.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.209
Mm-hm.

38:15.711 --> 38:20.299
Four-seven. Ah. See, we had seven-four.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.552
That explains it. And the expiration?

38:26.013 --> 38:27.515
Thank you so much.

38:28.182 --> 38:31.477
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Enjoy your stay.

38:32.102 --> 38:34.980
I highly recommend the sunset cruise.
It's awesome.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.525
Bye.

39:10.182 --> 39:12.685
- Señor Rayburn?
- Vicente.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.603
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

39:14.687 --> 39:17.773
It's Wayne Lowry.
He's gone back on the deal.

39:22.736 --> 39:23.821
No deal?

39:24.071 --> 39:25.072
No deal.

39:26.198 --> 39:27.575
May we, uh--?

39:28.909 --> 39:31.912
Absolutely, <i>sí.</i>

39:36.166 --> 39:39.086
- <i>Hold for Ms. Chaffee.</i>
<i>- Hi, Meg.</i>

39:39.336 --> 39:42.298
Hi, Susannah, how are you?
Thank you for calling me back.

39:42.381 --> 39:45.384
Of course. Although I'm not sure
what there is to talk about.

39:45.467 --> 39:48.387
<i>Well, I've been reading over the Pell case</i>
<i>and I have some thoughts on it.</i>

39:48.470 --> 39:51.015
Meg, you-- You don't have to worry
about the Pell case anymore.

39:51.974 --> 39:54.310
I'm so sorry that I wasn't able to make it
to New York.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.604
You missed a client meeting.

39:56.687 --> 39:58.689
Yeah, I know. We had a family emergency.

39:58.772 --> 40:00.733
<i>You didn't call to tell me</i>
<i>you wouldn't make it.</i>

40:00.816 --> 40:04.028
<i>Ravi had to fill in, he botched</i>
<i>the whole thing, it's a mess now.</i>

40:04.278 --> 40:05.404
I'm so sorry.

40:05.571 --> 40:08.824
And then I called to talk to you about it
and you basically hung up on me.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.246
You know, why don't you let me
talk to the client? I can fix it.

40:14.330 --> 40:18.792
Oh, no, that time has passed.
I'm sorry, Meg. This isn't working out.

40:19.877 --> 40:21.420
Susannah, it was a family emergency.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.422
My brother was in bad shape.
I had to be here.

40:23.505 --> 40:26.467
<i>Yes, and I'm sorry about that.</i>
<i>But it isn't our problem.</i>

40:26.550 --> 40:28.469
I promise it will never happen again.

40:28.594 --> 40:30.137
-No, it won't.
-<i>Susannah--</i>

40:30.220 --> 40:32.473
You're a smart woman.
I'm sure you'll find something else.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.725
Susannah,
it was a family fucking emergency.

40:34.808 --> 40:36.101
<i>Goodbye, Meg.</i>

40:43.317 --> 40:44.485
Fuck.

41:02.711 --> 41:05.756
- I don't have anything for you.
<i>- That's too bad.</i>

41:06.507 --> 41:08.801
I need to know where it's safe to land.

41:10.219 --> 41:14.181
-They've got ears in a lot of places.
-<i>What about Sugarloaf?</i>

41:17.518 --> 41:18.811
I'm not sure.

41:19.061 --> 41:20.396
<i>Find out.</i>

41:24.274 --> 41:26.694
If Sugarloaf works for you, I--

41:27.069 --> 41:29.947
-I can try to steer them away.
-<i>Well, that would be nice.</i>

41:30.072 --> 41:33.325
But I need more than a maybe
or I tell my story.

41:39.915 --> 41:41.041
Are we on?

41:41.625 --> 41:45.713
Stay tuned.
Son of a bitch better come through.

42:43.395 --> 42:45.647
Another? Please?

42:47.399 --> 42:48.609
Thank you.

42:59.870 --> 43:02.581
- I get that a lot.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

43:02.664 --> 43:06.460
People think, "Oh, he's a cop.
Hey, can you get me out of this ticket?"

43:07.294 --> 43:09.630
- You know, I just wanna--
- Yeah. Everybody asks you.

43:10.130 --> 43:13.675
- Might as well ask, so--
- Yeah. Like, "Let me use your--"

43:17.012 --> 43:20.599
- Somewhere in between a--
- I'm being promoted?

43:22.976 --> 43:24.144
Thank you.

43:24.269 --> 43:28.273
I have a cousin named Gabriella.
But we call her Gabby.

43:28.357 --> 43:32.111
- Oh, okay. As in G-A-B-B--?
- Hi.

43:34.279 --> 43:37.074
-Hey, um... Meg.
-Hi.

43:38.951 --> 43:40.786
I didn't know you were b-- back in town.

43:40.869 --> 43:43.288
Yeah, I am. I'm back.

43:45.666 --> 43:47.960
Gabriella, this is Meg.

43:48.418 --> 43:50.462
-Hi.
-Hi.

43:52.464 --> 43:55.134
How is--? How's New York? Good?

43:56.301 --> 44:00.180
New York is so good.
It's such a great city.

44:00.681 --> 44:01.682
That's great.

44:02.891 --> 44:06.687
-Yeah, it's a great city.
-Yeah. Oh, h-- Hi, I'm Meg.

44:07.229 --> 44:09.481
-I'm the ex.
-I've heard about you. Gabriella.

44:09.815 --> 44:12.025
You have? Oh, no. What did you hear?

44:12.526 --> 44:13.819
Only nice things.

44:16.071 --> 44:17.656
Come on. I doubt that.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.993
I mean,
I kind of slept with someone else, but--

44:21.493 --> 44:23.495
-I'm sure he told you that.
-Meg.

44:23.704 --> 44:26.248
Okay, fine. I did sleep with someone else,
but whatever.

44:26.748 --> 44:28.876
- It threw a wrench in the wedding plans.
- Meg.

44:28.959 --> 44:30.586
But it was good for you, right?

44:30.669 --> 44:32.004
- Meg.
- I don't recommend it though.

44:32.129 --> 44:33.088
You're drunk.

44:33.255 --> 44:36.508
Anyway, so yeah.
I'm not really that nice of a person.

44:37.676 --> 44:41.054
-Not nice at all.
-Meg, you should go home.

44:41.513 --> 44:43.098
You seem nice though.

44:43.515 --> 44:44.892
Are you a nice girl, Georgina?

44:44.975 --> 44:46.018
- Gabriella.
- It's Gabriella.

44:46.143 --> 44:47.769
Gabriella.

44:48.353 --> 44:49.438
Sorry.

44:49.521 --> 44:53.483
I think that he really deserves somebody
who's nice, after me.

44:53.650 --> 44:56.153
So, don't go fucking around on him.
You hear me?

44:56.278 --> 44:57.905
-Because he--
-Um...

44:57.988 --> 44:59.364
can I get you a ride home?

44:59.823 --> 45:01.742
Do you need me to call you a car?

45:04.953 --> 45:06.747
-No.
-Hmm?

45:06.830 --> 45:09.249
No, no, no, I don't.

45:09.958 --> 45:12.336
I don't need you to do anything for me.

45:13.253 --> 45:14.379
Okay? Here.

45:14.463 --> 45:15.923
Thanks.

45:17.424 --> 45:18.467
Okay.

45:20.594 --> 45:23.055
-It's so nice to meet you.
-Yeah. You, too.

45:23.555 --> 45:24.848
You're just so pretty.

45:25.766 --> 45:27.225
Congratulations.

45:58.548 --> 46:00.384
I'm sorry about this morning.

46:10.268 --> 46:13.063
Kevin was arrested yesterday.
I didn't tell you.

46:15.899 --> 46:16.942
For what?

46:18.652 --> 46:20.821
DUI. Possession.

46:21.613 --> 46:24.241
-Ran through a stop sign.
-Oh, my God.

46:24.324 --> 46:25.909
-Hit by a car.
-Is he okay?

46:25.993 --> 46:27.661
Uh...

46:29.538 --> 46:30.747
Physically.

46:38.922 --> 46:40.841
It seems like so long ago.

46:46.805 --> 46:48.098
What?

46:48.598 --> 46:50.225
Just the celebration.

46:50.517 --> 46:52.060
Danny coming home.

46:54.062 --> 46:55.814
Everyone was happy.

47:00.902 --> 47:02.779
For a night, anyway.

47:08.577 --> 47:10.203
Diana.

47:15.917 --> 47:19.171
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
for you and the kids, don't you?

47:26.428 --> 47:27.804
Yeah.

47:32.893 --> 47:35.395
Eww. That stuff's disgusting.
What's even in it?

47:35.479 --> 47:37.147
It's branched-chain amino acids.

47:37.230 --> 47:39.232
I don't know how I feel about that stuff,
honey.

47:39.316 --> 47:41.401
- Mom, it's safe.
- Yeah.

47:41.693 --> 47:43.361
I've got something Saturday night.

47:43.445 --> 47:44.988
By something, you mean a date?

47:46.114 --> 47:47.199
Who's the victim?

47:47.365 --> 47:48.909
What do you care?

47:49.034 --> 47:51.787
Well, you know what I'm gonna
need. A name. Telephone number.

47:51.870 --> 47:53.413
Passport. Blood type.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.082
If you can get it, that would be great.

47:55.207 --> 47:56.416
Seth Scott.

47:57.084 --> 47:58.335
That guy?

47:58.460 --> 48:01.046
He's smart.
He actually likes to think about things.

48:01.129 --> 48:02.339
Okay.

48:02.547 --> 48:04.382
But you can't be out late.

48:04.966 --> 48:06.551
Why? It's a Saturday.

48:11.848 --> 48:14.684
And we have to get up early on Sunday.
You know that.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.819
Do we have to go?

48:25.195 --> 48:26.655
I hate it there.

48:28.448 --> 48:29.783
It's so depressing.

48:32.577 --> 48:34.162
Yes, we have to go.

48:36.581 --> 48:38.208
Your dad depends on it.

48:40.460 --> 48:42.170
I don't care.

48:43.797 --> 48:46.424
I'm sick of explaining to people
why my dad's in prison.

48:54.891 --> 48:56.226
He killed Danny.

48:56.309 --> 48:57.811
He got what he deserved.

49:00.397 --> 49:02.524
Didn't you, Dad?

49:07.696 --> 49:09.197
Didn't you?

49:11.241 --> 49:14.244
-Dad.
-Hmm?

49:15.162 --> 49:17.372
Didn't you say I could stay out later
on Saturdays?

49:20.584 --> 49:22.752
I said if it's okay with your mother.

49:26.089 --> 49:28.758
Big Pine's quiet as a church.
No surprise there.

49:28.925 --> 49:30.385
Maybe this whole thing is just noise.

49:30.468 --> 49:33.930
No, something's up.
Lowry just sent his entire family away.

49:34.014 --> 49:36.308
Yeah. Why would he do that
if he's square with his people?

49:36.433 --> 49:38.685
Well, maybe his wife just wanted to go
to Disney World.

49:38.768 --> 49:40.729
We're zeroing in
on a few likely spots.

49:40.854 --> 49:42.772
Summerland, Sugarloaf,
Cudjoe and Big Torch.

49:42.856 --> 49:44.691
It would be nice
to narrow that down.

49:44.774 --> 49:46.276
I, uh--

49:46.568 --> 49:47.736
I know a fella.

49:50.197 --> 49:53.033
- Ex-Marine. Communication corps.
- Hank Rourke?

49:53.533 --> 49:56.828
That's right. He's a good man.
He's got ears just about everywhere.

49:56.912 --> 49:59.206
- You might wanna talk to him.
- All right.

50:40.413 --> 50:44.209
- <i>This is Rourke.</i>
- Hank. It's John.

50:45.252 --> 50:47.128
The feds are gonna come to you.

50:47.837 --> 50:49.881
-You know what to say.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

50:50.674 --> 50:52.926
<i>-I'll tell them what we talked about.</i>
-That's right.

50:54.094 --> 50:56.179
-Thank you for this.
<i>-My pleasure.</i>

50:56.263 --> 50:57.514
<i>But you owe me one.</i>

51:17.409 --> 51:18.535
Coast Guard patrol schedule.

51:20.745 --> 51:21.955
Anything else?

51:28.586 --> 51:32.382
The task force is focused on Big Torch.
Sugarloaf is clear.

51:33.216 --> 51:34.509
How do you know?

51:36.761 --> 51:39.180
Because I fed it to them.
The intel came from my source.

51:39.264 --> 51:42.183
You don't trust me?
Why don't you go out to Big Torch?

51:42.392 --> 51:44.936
They'll pin a big shiny medal
over my fucking heart.

51:45.145 --> 51:48.857
Detective, what do they call that thing?
Mutual assured destruction?

51:48.940 --> 51:50.442
I think that's it.

51:51.109 --> 51:54.863
You fuck me, I fuck you twice as hard.

52:00.952 --> 52:04.289
Tomorrow night, Sugarloaf Key.

52:04.998 --> 52:06.583
And it best be clear.

52:24.684 --> 52:26.186
Who put up the bail?

52:28.480 --> 52:29.814
I did.

52:30.982 --> 52:33.735
-I'll pay you back.
-Oh...

52:33.860 --> 52:36.071
-I don't care about the money.
-I'm gonna pay you back.

52:36.154 --> 52:37.155
-Okay, fine.
-I swear.

52:37.364 --> 52:38.823
Okay, fine.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.702
The real issue...

52:44.621 --> 52:46.956
is that John got Lowry
to make a deal with the DA.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.917
And everything was gonna be okay.

52:49.042 --> 52:49.876
-And then you--
-What?

52:49.959 --> 52:52.212
-I don't understand.
-He went back on the deal.

52:53.963 --> 52:55.715
So, now we're fucked.

52:56.091 --> 52:58.301
What do you mean? What's going on?

52:58.635 --> 53:00.220
I don't know.

53:01.137 --> 53:02.514
I don't know what's going on.

53:04.307 --> 53:05.558
Well, what--?

53:05.642 --> 53:09.270
-What does John say?
-I haven't spoken to him since last night.

53:10.522 --> 53:11.689
Meg, I'm--

53:11.898 --> 53:13.316
Okay, I know you're sorry.

53:15.610 --> 53:17.779
I'm not even mad at you anymore, okay?

53:18.780 --> 53:19.823
I'm just--

53:21.533 --> 53:22.450
What?

53:24.577 --> 53:26.329
I'm just fucking scared.

53:34.629 --> 53:36.881
I'm gonna help you
through the legal process, okay?

53:36.965 --> 53:39.509
You don't have to do that.
Go-- Go back to your job.

53:39.592 --> 53:41.719
Please. Go back to New York.

53:44.305 --> 53:45.390
No, it's fine.

53:46.349 --> 53:47.976
I wanna stay.

53:52.856 --> 53:54.232
Come on.

53:58.153 --> 54:00.780
He saw me singing in a club.
That's how we met.

54:04.909 --> 54:06.703
He said he liked my voice.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.415
That's what I needed to hear.

54:11.583 --> 54:16.379
Then he came and saw me sing
in other places and we'd talk after and...

54:18.006 --> 54:19.716
I knew he was trouble.

54:19.799 --> 54:21.176
He was a lot older.

54:27.891 --> 54:29.392
But I loved him.

54:36.774 --> 54:39.277
I'm not gonna give you any money, Eve.

54:40.945 --> 54:42.864
-I'm the mother of your grandchild.
-I--

54:43.364 --> 54:44.991
Anyone can be a mother.

54:46.618 --> 54:48.578
The trick is to be a good one.

54:50.580 --> 54:51.664
Like you were?

54:52.499 --> 54:53.750
No.

54:54.751 --> 54:56.711
I wasn't any good at it either.

55:03.927 --> 55:05.220
I warned you.

55:06.304 --> 55:07.514
About Danny.

55:12.018 --> 55:15.438
What must it have been like for him
to have a son he couldn't take care of?

55:15.522 --> 55:17.190
Probably the same as it was for me.

55:17.273 --> 55:20.485
No, Eve. You had a choice.

55:21.569 --> 55:23.780
I respect that choice, but it was yours.

55:25.532 --> 55:27.200
Look, I just want what was promised to me.

55:27.992 --> 55:29.661
I didn't promise you anything.

55:30.245 --> 55:32.247
You had an arrangement with my husband.

55:32.705 --> 55:34.082
And he's gone now.

55:37.210 --> 55:38.878
You're just gonna have to...

55:39.462 --> 55:40.880
make do without him.

56:21.379 --> 56:23.798
<i>Stand by five</i>
<i>while I bring up captain. Over.</i>

56:25.425 --> 56:29.345
<i>Patrol 508 reporting in.</i>
<i>We're headed to Big Torch.</i>

56:41.316 --> 56:43.943
-Talk to me.
-Everything's quiet.

56:44.235 --> 56:45.111
Water's calm.

56:45.194 --> 56:47.947
I hear there's a party
over at Big Torch.

56:48.031 --> 56:49.157
<i>Not here.</i>

56:49.240 --> 56:53.536
<i>-When are they landing?</i>
-Should be there in about 30 minutes.

56:53.661 --> 56:54.912
Call me to confirm.

57:05.465 --> 57:06.799
John.

57:07.467 --> 57:08.384
We're heading out.

57:09.510 --> 57:11.304
- Where's Lowry?
- The bait shop.

57:11.387 --> 57:13.306
We're gonna get this motherfucker tonight.

57:13.389 --> 57:15.224
We'll keep you in the loop, all right?

57:16.267 --> 57:17.644
-Marco.
-Yo.

57:19.062 --> 57:20.355
What?

57:24.400 --> 57:27.028
You and I,
we've known each other a long time.

57:27.487 --> 57:30.031
-Like family.
-Yeah.

57:34.994 --> 57:37.288
You think I'm a good person, right?

57:38.539 --> 57:40.375
Yeah. What kind of
fucking question is that?

57:40.458 --> 57:41.584
Yeah, of course.

57:44.087 --> 57:45.421
Yeah.

57:48.007 --> 57:49.550
Be safe.

57:50.718 --> 57:52.178
I will.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.263
So...

59:17.847 --> 59:19.348
Johnny boy.

59:24.312 --> 59:26.189
You sure you're doing the right thing?

59:27.190 --> 59:28.983
You could still change your mind.

59:33.196 --> 59:35.990
What was it Dad used to say
about changing your mind?

59:36.324 --> 59:38.659
"You change your mind,
you lose your mind."

59:39.744 --> 59:41.079
Yeah.

59:42.663 --> 59:44.540
A man's gotta have convictions.

1:00:01.849 --> 1:00:03.392
Had a very nice meeting.

1:00:03.643 --> 1:00:04.685
Heading home.

1:00:12.944 --> 1:00:15.363
<i>But you didn't answer</i>
<i>the question.</i>

1:00:16.656 --> 1:00:18.741
So, do you think
you made the right choice?

1:00:23.996 --> 1:00:25.456
I don't know, Danny.

1:00:26.916 --> 1:00:28.334
I'd ask you.

1:00:30.336 --> 1:00:33.756
But you never made
the right fucking choice in your life.

1:00:35.049 --> 1:00:36.342
Doesn't matter now anyway.

1:00:37.009 --> 1:00:38.469
It's a done deal, right?

1:00:54.277 --> 1:00:55.987
<i>You surprised me, John.</i>

1:00:56.612 --> 1:00:58.156
Wait. Stop.

1:01:00.449 --> 1:01:02.910
<i>Yeah, I thought you'd go</i>
<i>a different way on this.</i>

1:01:07.081 --> 1:01:08.916
Get out of the car.
Hands behind your head.

1:01:12.670 --> 1:01:14.130
Hands on the ground.

1:01:16.632 --> 1:01:18.634
<i>I guess you couldn't go through with it.</i>

1:01:20.344 --> 1:01:22.346
<i>Being the bad boy, like me.</i>

1:01:31.439 --> 1:01:34.692
Wow, you are actually
gonna let Lowry talk.

1:01:38.321 --> 1:01:40.740
They're probably on their way
to pick him up right now.

1:01:44.410 --> 1:01:46.746
He'd talk eventually anyway.

1:01:51.375 --> 1:01:53.669
You really think you can control
everything, don't you?

1:01:53.753 --> 1:01:56.756
You think he's gonna talk and
you're just gonna worm your way out of it.

1:01:56.839 --> 1:01:58.007
Is that it?

1:01:58.966 --> 1:02:00.927
You're just gonna explain it away?

1:02:07.058 --> 1:02:08.226
Or maybe you--?

1:02:09.769 --> 1:02:12.897
You just don't want to carry
the lie anymore. Is that it?

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.525
You want the truth to come out?

1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:18.945
You want everyone to know?

1:02:22.073 --> 1:02:23.407
Yeah.

1:02:25.910 --> 1:02:27.745
I think you do.

1:02:28.955 --> 1:02:31.123
I think you want the relief.

1:02:42.051 --> 1:02:43.094
Marco.

1:02:43.177 --> 1:02:45.846
<i>As soon as the</i>
<i>bust went down, we moved on Lowry.</i>

1:02:46.639 --> 1:02:49.976
<i>You better get down</i>
<i>to the bait shop. Now.</i>

1:02:50.893 --> 1:02:52.645
I'll be right there.

1:02:54.438 --> 1:02:56.357
Moment of truth.

1:03:05.616 --> 1:03:07.326
Hank was right about Sugarloaf.

1:03:07.410 --> 1:03:09.453
-They walked right into us.
-Where's Lowry?

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:10.621
Inside.

1:03:20.715 --> 1:03:22.883
John, come here.

1:03:26.220 --> 1:03:30.266
We found this when we got here.
Stabbed at least ten, twelve times.

1:03:31.642 --> 1:03:33.561
Haven't found a weapon yet.

1:03:38.357 --> 1:03:40.276
You wanted justice?

1:03:41.444 --> 1:03:43.612
Lowry's own people just gave it to you.

1:03:45.531 --> 1:03:46.949
It's over, John.

1:04:11.265 --> 1:04:13.434
We need to talk to you, Vicente.

1:04:15.644 --> 1:04:17.855
It's about Wayne Lowry.

1:04:19.315 --> 1:04:20.816
He was killed last night.

1:04:32.370 --> 1:04:35.539
No. Vicente, no.
Did you hear what we said?

1:04:53.015 --> 1:04:56.852
He says that the other day after we left,
he realized that something had to be done.

1:05:07.238 --> 1:05:09.073
He says he did something that--

1:05:09.532 --> 1:05:11.492
That you couldn't do.

1:05:14.412 --> 1:05:16.872
You tell him to shut up.
That we're gonna get him an attorney.

1:05:16.956 --> 1:05:18.332
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1:05:59.248 --> 1:06:02.001
He says he killed Lowry
and he's prepared for the punishment.

1:06:18.267 --> 1:06:20.436
He's not worried about the law.

1:06:20.936 --> 1:06:24.565
His religion tells him
that confession is good for the soul.
