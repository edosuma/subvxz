00:07.708 --> 00:10.544
- *

00:10.644 --> 00:12.613
- Hey, look at you on
your first day of work.

00:12.713 --> 00:16.217
You even look adorable
covered in Splat spew.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.452
- Yeah, I'm all dirty
from cleaning the tubes.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.055
Jay Jay doesn't know
how I do it.

00:21.155 --> 00:25.393
[arm squeaking]

00:25.493 --> 00:29.097
- Wow, now I know who to call
when I accidentally

00:29.197 --> 00:31.432
flush an earring
down the toilet.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.435
- Yep, you call me,
I'll call a plumber.

00:34.535 --> 00:38.106
- Well, anyway, good luck
with your first day of work

00:38.206 --> 00:39.873
and stay on your toes--

00:39.973 --> 00:41.675
all 11 of them.
- Shhh. Quiet.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.412
You're the only person who
knows about my bonus toe.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.848
Well, you and that dude
at the sandal store.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.883
- Hey, I think
your bonus toe is cute.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.852
- Well, I don't.
It's my secret shame.

00:51.952 --> 00:55.723
My hairy, pointed-
the-wrong-way shame.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.625
- Link, you can trust me, okay?

00:57.725 --> 00:59.260
We're in the secret-sharing
phase now that

00:59.360 --> 01:02.396
we're officially "Phoebink."
- Unh.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.465
- "Linkebe."
- Uh...

01:04.565 --> 01:06.334
- Okay, our names
don't go together,

01:06.434 --> 01:09.437
but we do.
- BOTH: [laughing]

01:09.537 --> 01:11.972
- Guys, I found us
a new drummer.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.041
This is Wolfgang.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.909
- That's a weird name.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.778
What's up? I'm Oyster.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.347
- And I'm Gideon.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.515
I'm kinda the heart throb
of this band.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.956
- Wolfgang is exactly
what we've been looking for.

01:29.056 --> 01:31.159
There's just one tiny catch.

01:31.192 --> 01:34.162
- [speaking German]
Wolfgang!

01:34.195 --> 01:35.363
- He's a foreign
exchange student

01:35.463 --> 01:37.498
who only speaks German.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.801
Oh, by the way, Gideon,
he lives with your family now.

01:42.503 --> 01:46.440
- Fine, but I'm not
sharing my water bed.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.877
- How about we celebrate
with a rock feast?

01:49.977 --> 01:51.712
- [button beeping]

01:53.614 --> 01:55.949
- One taco?

01:56.049 --> 01:58.752
- It's all we can afford, bro.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.855
- ALL: [clamoring]

02:01.955 --> 02:03.257
- Hi, guys!

02:03.357 --> 02:04.558
You're a band, right?

02:04.658 --> 02:06.460
- Yeah--unless you're lookin'
for a stolen cowbell.

02:06.560 --> 02:11.499
Then, no.
- [tapping cowbell]

02:11.599 --> 02:13.201
- I'm holding auditions
to hire a band

02:13.301 --> 02:15.068
to play here every Saturday.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.570
- Cool!
- Awesome!

02:16.670 --> 02:19.507
- Wolfgang!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.742
A band of our caliber
comes at a price.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.378
- The pay is free food.
- That's the price.

02:24.478 --> 02:28.482
- Wait, how can we be
the Splatburger band,

02:28.582 --> 02:30.218
if we don't have
a single good song?

02:30.318 --> 02:31.619
- What about
the new song I wrote?

02:31.719 --> 02:35.389
Everyone will love it.
Watch.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.525
* Words words words
words are for nerds *

02:37.625 --> 02:41.028
* Nerds nerds nerds
are using the words *

02:41.128 --> 02:43.063
* So we won't use words

02:43.231 --> 02:44.898
- [electric guitar
high notes]

02:44.998 --> 02:46.667
- [buttons beeping]

02:46.767 --> 02:48.702
- * Words words words
words are for nerds *

02:48.802 --> 02:50.671
- Uh-oh, they're
ordering tomatoes.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.673
We should stop them.
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

02:52.773 --> 02:55.309
- You really shouldn't try
so hard on your first day.

02:55.409 --> 02:59.313
- * Words are for nerds
- [tomatoes splatting]

02:59.413 --> 03:03.684
- [one note playing]

03:06.254 --> 03:08.055
- *

03:08.155 --> 03:09.323
* What you see

03:09.423 --> 03:10.758
* Is not what you get

03:10.858 --> 03:14.127
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

03:14.262 --> 03:15.663
* We fit right in

03:15.763 --> 03:17.331
* Bet you never guessed

03:17.431 --> 03:18.666
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

03:18.766 --> 03:20.468
* Just like all the rest

03:20.568 --> 03:22.270
* A picture
perfect family *

03:22.303 --> 03:24.338
* Is what we try to be

03:24.438 --> 03:25.506
* Look closer,
you might see *

03:25.606 --> 03:27.341
* The crazy things we do

03:27.441 --> 03:29.042
* This isn't
make believe *

03:29.142 --> 03:30.578
* It's our reality

03:30.678 --> 03:32.045
* Just your average family

03:32.145 --> 03:35.283
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

03:35.383 --> 03:38.952
* Livin' a double life

03:45.393 --> 03:48.362
Colosso, what rhymes
with snot rocket?

03:48.462 --> 03:53.200
- You stink at writing
songs--ocket.

03:53.301 --> 03:56.103
- Whatever--like you know
anything about making music.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.571
- For your information,

03:57.671 --> 03:59.640
I once dropped
my own rap album.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.208
- * Hey! Hey! Hey!

04:01.309 --> 04:05.112
- * I hipped and I hopped
I could go non-stop *

04:05.212 --> 04:08.148
* Because I am a bunny
and carrots are my-- *

04:08.316 --> 04:10.217
- Enough!

04:10.318 --> 04:12.119
That sounds awful.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.322
- Yeah, well, I didn't
say I wrote good music.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.459
To do that you need
to have a heart

04:18.559 --> 04:20.528
and supervillains
like us don't have one.

04:20.628 --> 04:24.064
- Hey, I have a heart, okay?
It's just...

04:24.164 --> 04:27.901
filled with spiders
and black licorice.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.739
Maybe I don't have what it
takes to write a good song.

04:31.839 --> 04:35.008
- Link is seriously
the best boyfriend ever.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.411
- I know. I feel like
every time I turn around,

04:37.511 --> 04:39.513
he's giving you another gift.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.715
- [arm squeaking]

04:44.685 --> 04:46.153
- [gasping]

04:46.253 --> 04:48.589
- [arm squeaking]

04:48.689 --> 04:50.123
- [door closes]

04:50.223 --> 04:54.127
- See? You're dating
a gift ninja.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.364
- Yeah, I'm running
out of space in my diary

04:56.397 --> 04:57.998
to write about him.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.100
Seven hundred pages
of passion and poetry

05:00.200 --> 05:02.670
straight from the heart.

05:02.770 --> 05:03.971
- The tree that died
to make that diary

05:04.071 --> 05:07.040
dies a little more every
time you write in it.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.912
- Max, if you want a hit song
with meaning and passion,

05:12.012 --> 05:13.547
you need to get that diary.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.882
- Well, I can never
find her diary.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.251
She hides it ever since Billy
did a book report on it.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.020
- Well, then, you've gotta
sneak into her room

05:20.120 --> 05:21.589
and see where she puts it.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.723
- How would I do that?

05:22.823 --> 05:26.527
Hide inside of
a giant teddy bear?

05:26.627 --> 05:31.899
- *

05:31.999 --> 05:35.969
- Aw, the gift ninja
struck again.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.571
[sighing]

05:37.671 --> 05:39.540
I wonder what my sweetie
wrote this time?

05:39.640 --> 05:43.076
"Here's this. From Link."

05:43.176 --> 05:45.245
Well, they can't
all be winners.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.415
[kisses bear]

05:56.524 --> 06:00.928
- Dr. Colosso, you pooped in
our shoes for the last time.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.296
- You can't prove it was me.

06:03.431 --> 06:06.434
- We found your
tiny toilet paper.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.203
- And your tiny magazines.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.574
Maybe a ride on the twirl
and hurl will teach you.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.242
Super-spin him, Billy.

06:15.342 --> 06:18.011
- [zooming]
- COLOSSO: Whoa! Oh! Oh! Oh!

06:18.111 --> 06:21.449
Oh! Oh! Oh! Stop spinnin' me!
I'm gonna puke!

06:21.482 --> 06:23.050
- What's going on here?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.653
- We were just
getting Dr. Colosso back

06:25.753 --> 06:27.354
for pooping in our shoes.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.591
- What makes you think
acting like that is okay?

06:30.691 --> 06:35.128
- Colosso! You pooped
in my shoes!

06:35.228 --> 06:37.631
I'm canceling your tiny
magazine subscription--

06:37.731 --> 06:40.701
after I cancel you.
- Hank!

06:40.801 --> 06:42.703
I think the kids have
been picking up

06:42.803 --> 06:44.638
some ugly behavior from you.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.975
- Uh! Uh-oh, here comes lunch!

06:48.075 --> 06:50.110
- [vomit splattering]
- BARB: [screaming]

06:50.210 --> 06:52.580
- You puked on my new shoes!

06:52.680 --> 06:55.115
Oh, eat lightning, barf bunny!

06:55.215 --> 06:57.651
[powers zapping]
- COLOSSO: [yelping]

07:00.020 --> 07:02.089
- Correction.

07:02.189 --> 07:06.293
They've been picking up
ugly behavior from us.

07:06.393 --> 07:14.267
- *

07:21.008 --> 07:23.511
- [door opens, closes]

07:26.880 --> 07:28.381
- Okay, Dr. Colosso,

07:28.516 --> 07:30.618
we've been at each other's
throats lately

07:30.718 --> 07:32.252
and that's about to end.

07:32.352 --> 07:35.088
- Mom's gonna light him up.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.358
- You are about to get a taste
of what you deserve.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.561
- Here it comes.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.697
- Carrot cake!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.032
- BILLY, NORA, COLOSSO:
What?!

07:45.132 --> 07:46.967
- We wanted to apologize

07:47.067 --> 07:48.636
for raising our voices
at you earlier.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.370
- Oh, thanks, guys.

07:50.538 --> 07:54.207
I look forward to pooping
this into your shoes.

07:54.307 --> 08:00.013
- Ho, ho, ho, Colosso.
You are a scamp!

08:00.113 --> 08:02.115
- What's going on here?

08:02.215 --> 08:04.417
- Oh, I get it.

08:04.552 --> 08:07.254
[zooming]

08:07.354 --> 08:11.091
It's backwards day.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.294
- Can somebody tell me
what's going on here?

08:14.394 --> 08:16.063
Billy's clothes
are on backwards

08:16.163 --> 08:18.699
and he's making more
sense than you two.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.634
- Your father and I need
to set a better example.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.470
So, from now on, we're gonna
be nice to Dr. Colosso,

08:23.571 --> 08:25.438
even if he's not
being nice to us.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.207
- Yes, because
we are superheroes

08:27.307 --> 08:30.277
and we must never stoop
to a supervillain's level.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.679
- COLOSSO: Saved ya
a slice, Hank!

08:31.779 --> 08:35.182
- [cake splatting]

08:35.282 --> 08:37.918
- Thanks, my furry friend.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.287
See? No stooping.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.723
- [cake splatting]

08:45.593 --> 08:47.094
- [laughing]

08:47.194 --> 08:50.163
- JAY JAY: That was great.
Thank you.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.267
- Hey, Max, your new
lyrics are incredible.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.138
- [speaking German]

08:58.238 --> 09:01.208
- You're a real softy,
aren't you?

09:01.308 --> 09:04.745
- Yeah, I'm just
a big old teddy bear.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.246
- Okay, you guys are up.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.448
- Let's go.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.954
All right, this song
means a lot to me

09:14.054 --> 09:18.325
as an artist, songwriter
and someone who likes free food.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.828
Hit it, boys!

09:20.928 --> 09:27.167
- *

09:27.267 --> 09:28.802
* You got a little secret

09:28.902 --> 09:30.337
* Something I never knew

09:30.437 --> 09:31.772
* But what's so special

09:31.872 --> 09:33.340
* Is the trust
between me and you *

09:33.440 --> 09:35.408
* I care about you deeply

09:35.508 --> 09:37.377
* I want you to know

09:37.477 --> 09:40.280
* I'll never speak a word
about your bonus toe *

09:40.380 --> 09:41.915
- * Your bonus toe

09:42.015 --> 09:44.417
- * It's no biggie
- * Your bonus toe

09:44.517 --> 09:47.454
- * So get jiggy
- * Your bonus toe

09:47.554 --> 09:49.790
- * With your extra piggy

09:49.890 --> 09:53.460
* I'll never speak a word
about your bonus toe *

09:53.560 --> 09:56.329
- That's enough!
That's enough!

09:56.429 --> 09:58.465
Wow!
[laughing]

09:58.565 --> 10:01.234
Just give us a sec, okay?

10:01.334 --> 10:03.203
- Max, I need to talk to you.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.038
- Sorry, Link,
no autographs for dudes.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.373
- N-N-N-No.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.276
Did you find out about
my extra toe from Phoebe?

10:09.376 --> 10:12.780
- Oh, um, technically, yes.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.483
Is it weird that
I'm dying to see it?

10:16.583 --> 10:19.152
- I can't believe
she told you my secret.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.154
- You'd better get some
more songs ready.

10:21.254 --> 10:24.124
You boys are the house
band at Splatburger!

10:24.224 --> 10:27.728
- CROWD: [applauding]
- BAND: [hooting]

10:27.828 --> 10:30.463
- Hey, Link. What time you
gettin' off work?

10:30.563 --> 10:33.701
I actually flushed
an earring down the toilet.

10:33.801 --> 10:37.404
- Was that before or after
you flushed my trust?

10:39.072 --> 10:42.442
- What are you talking about?
- You know what you did.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.411
I don't think we should
see each other any more.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.147
- Wait, Link, you can't
just leave.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.718
- Right, my shift's
not over yet.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.959
- * Your bonus toe

10:59.059 --> 11:01.361
- Good rehearsal, guys.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.464
- Wolfgang!

11:04.564 --> 11:07.467
- Wolfgang's right.
It wasn't good.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.936
We just played
our one song over and over.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.504
- Yeah, bro, if we wanna keep
our gig, and get free food,

11:11.604 --> 11:14.041
we need more good
songs like "Bonus Toe."

11:14.141 --> 11:17.778
- Hey, relax. Maxie's gonna
write us a hit.

11:17.878 --> 11:18.779
You guys go home.

11:18.879 --> 11:23.751
I just need to find
my inspiration.

11:23.784 --> 11:28.388
And by that I mean take
a peek in Phoebe's diary.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.589
- Congrats, Max.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.658
Not only did you crush
that audition,

11:31.759 --> 11:34.427
but you also crushed
your sister's heart.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.163
[laughing]

11:36.263 --> 11:38.766
- Come on, Phoebe'll be fine.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.434
Link will get over it and
they'll get back together.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.203
Now if you'll excuse me,

11:43.303 --> 11:45.205
I have a giant teddy bear
to crawl into.

11:45.305 --> 11:52.412
- *

11:52.512 --> 11:55.282
- That Link is such a jerk
for breaking up with you.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.885
Hey, I know what'll make
you feel better.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.090
Boys are stupid!

12:03.190 --> 12:04.457
Boys are disgusting!

12:04.557 --> 12:06.159
Boys are--

12:06.259 --> 12:08.929
Wait, this bear's
a boy, right?

12:09.029 --> 12:14.134
- Well, it won't tell me what
I did wrong--so probably.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.203
[sighing]

12:16.303 --> 12:19.873
[grunt of effort]
- [heavy thud]

12:19.973 --> 12:21.541
- What's the use?

12:21.641 --> 12:22.876
Drop-kicking this bear
isn't gonna help me

12:22.976 --> 12:24.511
find out why Link
broke up with me.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.847
But maybe this note
I wrote him will.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.016
I really poured
my heart into it.

12:31.819 --> 12:36.189
- This is the most beautiful,
romantic thing I have ever read.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.491
- Can you just take
it to Link for me, please?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.327
- Of course.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.831
- [exhales]
[grunt of effort]

12:50.703 --> 12:52.672
- [door opens, closes]

12:59.012 --> 13:03.550
- [heavy thudding]
- MAX: [yelping]

13:03.650 --> 13:06.486
- Cherry, wait, don't go!

13:06.586 --> 13:08.288
- What's up?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.357
- I really need to talk to you.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.925
- Aw, Max.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.261
I'm flattered, but you're
my best friend's brother

13:14.361 --> 13:17.764
and I just don't think--
- I'm not asking you out.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.967
I wanna deliver that
note to Link myself

13:20.067 --> 13:22.635
and talk to him,
guy-to-guy, to fix this.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.005
- That is so sweet of you
to help Phoebe like that.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.007
- Okay, don't tell Phoebe
I took the note.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.709
I don't want her to
think I care about her.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.478
- You secretly have a heart.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.646
Are you sure you
don't wanna ask me out?

13:33.746 --> 13:36.683
Yeah, because I'd say--
- [door slamming]

13:40.420 --> 13:44.157
- Hello, new hit song.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.194
- You talkin' to me?

13:47.294 --> 13:49.562
Well, I'm the only holiday
creature here,

13:49.662 --> 13:53.000
so you must be talkin' to me.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.936
- You chewed holes
into all our clothes?

13:56.036 --> 13:57.370
- I'm not answering
that question

13:57.470 --> 14:00.640
until I put on
my lawyer costume.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.709
- I can't wear these shorts.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.912
Everyone will know that
I'm going through

14:04.978 --> 14:06.779
a "no underwear" phase.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.482
- Hey, so, how are you two
planning to get me back?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.084
Am I gonna need a barf bag?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.753
- Yeah, 'cause here comes
the twirl and hurl!

14:13.921 --> 14:14.988
- No, Billy!

14:15.088 --> 14:18.125
Remember, we don't
do that anymore.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.126
- What gives?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.928
First your parents are
all sunshine to me

14:20.961 --> 14:23.130
and now you two
won't punish me?

14:23.230 --> 14:26.934
Oh, no, am I not
annoying anymore?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.936
- Mom and dad taught
us that a superhero

14:29.036 --> 14:31.071
should never stoop
to a supervillain's level.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.373
- So, we're going to
be nice to you, too--

14:33.473 --> 14:34.774
no matter what.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.443
- Is that so?

14:36.543 --> 14:37.945
- Come on, Billy.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.980
Mom said she'd take us
clothes shopping at the mall.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.149
Yes, you need to
wear underwear.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.487
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

14:47.587 --> 14:50.790
Oyster, Gideon, and strange
German kid approaching.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.333
- Hey, guys, get the new
song lyrics I sent ya?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.405
What's happening?

15:05.505 --> 15:06.974
Are you guys okay?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.841
- The real question is--

15:08.976 --> 15:11.411
are you okay?

15:11.511 --> 15:14.847
- We read your song.
We know you're in pain.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.417
- Strudel?

15:17.517 --> 15:21.154
- Save your strudel.
It's just a song, guys.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.057
- "My heart skipped a beat
when I saw you before.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.859
But now I'm not sure my heart
even works anymore."

15:26.994 --> 15:30.063
That's not a song, bro,
it's a cry for help.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.632
- Don't you think I was
just being a normal,

15:32.732 --> 15:38.238
over-dramatic teenaged girl--
er, boy--because I'm a boy.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.907
- Only true pain could
write words like that.

15:41.008 --> 15:44.077
I know. I was once
burned pretty bad by a girl.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.678
Like actually burned.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.415
With a curling iron.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.250
- We've all been there.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.385
But Max has it worse.
- I do?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.587
- Yeah, that whole part
in the song about

15:54.687 --> 15:56.323
not knowing what
you did wrong.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.491
- [sobbing] I don't even
know what I did wrong.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.227
- I wanna help you, sweetie,

16:00.327 --> 16:03.196
but there's only one person
who can tell you that.

16:03.296 --> 16:07.234
- [sobbing]
- I know.

16:07.334 --> 16:12.639
- [groaning]
I'll be right back.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.641
- He's not gonna eat it.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.543
Group strudel!

16:16.643 --> 16:18.045
- Link and I had
the kind of relationship

16:18.078 --> 16:20.547
where we could share
anything with each other.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.881
- I know you did, honey.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.317
- Now he won't even
respond to my note.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.254
- Oh, that's because
boys are stupid.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.556
- [mouth full of ice cream]
I know!

16:29.656 --> 16:33.793
- Phoebe, I need to talk
to you about Link.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.662
- Don't say his name!

16:35.762 --> 16:38.065
I'll be in the fridge.
- [whipping cream spraying]

16:38.098 --> 16:40.533
- Max...Max,
just leave her alone.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.236
She doesn't wanna think
about you know who.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.538
Oh, I hope she
doesn't find the--

16:45.638 --> 16:48.075
- Sausage links?!

16:48.141 --> 16:51.078
[sobbing]

16:51.144 --> 16:53.980
[screaming, sobbing]

16:54.081 --> 16:58.918
- *

16:59.086 --> 17:01.621
- Welcome home, family.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.823
- Dad, what's happening?

17:03.923 --> 17:06.293
- I don't know.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.795
- Come on, you've all been
so kind to me lately.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.830
I wanted to make you dinner.

17:10.930 --> 17:14.334
- Wow, Mom, Colosso's learning
from your example, too.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.369
- Yeah, I didn't expect this.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.372
But maybe our efforts
inspired change.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.675
Nope, old leaves and grass.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.244
We're not eating this.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.012
- Really? What kind of lesson

17:26.113 --> 17:28.581
are you teaching your children,
if you won't even try it?

17:28.681 --> 17:33.253
- BARB: [sighing]

17:33.353 --> 17:37.790
Mmmm, that's some good grass.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.859
- I can't believe we've
been raking this up

17:39.959 --> 17:43.230
and just throwing it away.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.731
- Come on, kids, eat up.

17:44.831 --> 17:51.671
You don't want your parents to
think you're being mean to me.

17:51.771 --> 17:56.776
- Mmm, tastes like that
time I tripped in soccer.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.912
- This is delicious!
Where'd you get it?

18:00.012 --> 18:01.214
- The Hiddenville Dog Park!

18:01.314 --> 18:03.916
- HANK, BARB, NORA:
[sputtering]

18:04.016 --> 18:06.619
- I don't care what lesson
I'm teaching my kids,

18:06.719 --> 18:09.189
I am done being nice to you!
- Let me laser him, Dad!

18:09.289 --> 18:11.358
- I'm fryin' this bunny!
- COLOSSO: [laughing]

18:11.458 --> 18:13.760
Finally, you all
hate me again!

18:13.860 --> 18:16.062
- Wait, you want us
to get mad at you?

18:16.163 --> 18:17.830
- Yes, I'm a supervillain.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.301
If I'm not annoying superheroes,
I have nothing to live for.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.604
- So, in a weird way,
what I'm about to do

18:24.704 --> 18:27.940
is how you prefer
to be treated.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.277
- Your move, doody-mouth.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.981
[laughing]

18:35.081 --> 18:38.685
Whoa-a-a-a-a-a!
- [heavy thud]

18:38.785 --> 18:41.288
- COLOSSO: Hello! That's
what I'm talkin' about!

18:41.388 --> 18:43.923
- Billy, stop eating
the dog grass.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.426
- [snarling like dog]

18:48.895 --> 18:50.530
- Hey, make sure you open
with "Bonus Toe."

18:50.630 --> 18:54.434
That song inspired my new
line of appe-toe-sers.

18:54.534 --> 18:58.938
- Fried toe-tellini.
Maca-toe-ni and cheese?

18:59.038 --> 19:00.273
- JAY JAY: [laughing]

19:00.373 --> 19:02.342
- Boy, you really
went all out.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.211
- Dude, what about our pay?
- Ah.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.812
[clearing throat]

19:05.912 --> 19:10.283
- Sweaches!
Our own private tube.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.619
- Wolfgang tubin'!

19:12.719 --> 19:16.022
- Sorry, no eats till
you drop the beats.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.594
- Phoebe, you came.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.296
- Yeah, Link texted me
and said he was sorry

19:23.396 --> 19:25.332
for being a super
stretchy jerkface

19:25.432 --> 19:27.600
who smells like coleslaw.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.502
- I never sent you a text.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.003
- You didn't?

19:31.103 --> 19:33.240
- Okay, so I might have hacked
Link's phone and texted you.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.242
But he does smell
like coleslaw.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.776
- Why would you do that?

19:36.876 --> 19:38.778
- Because I needed
to get you here

19:38.878 --> 19:40.947
so I could talk
to you and Link.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.449
Here's the deal, right?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.451
- I don't wanna hear anything
you have to say, Max.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.386
- Me, neither.
I'm going home.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.556
- Come on, Max,
we've gotta play now.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.658
- Phoebe, don't go!

19:51.758 --> 19:54.661
* There's something
you gotta know *

19:54.761 --> 19:56.529
- What are you doing, dude?

19:56.629 --> 19:58.531
We're supposed to
play "Bonus Toe."

19:58.631 --> 20:00.567
- All right, new plan.
Watch me for the changes.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.369
Try to keep up.

20:02.469 --> 20:06.273
* This is a song about Phoebe

20:06.373 --> 20:09.609
* So Link put down
that drinky *

20:09.709 --> 20:12.745
* Phoebe didn't tell me
about your extra piggy *

20:12.845 --> 20:17.317
* I needed a song
to get my band this giggy *

20:17.417 --> 20:20.453
* So I stole a page
from her diary *

20:20.553 --> 20:23.756
* And I passed it off
as a song *

20:23.856 --> 20:26.626
* Diary

20:26.726 --> 20:30.463
* Phoebe wasn't the one
who broke your trust *

20:30.563 --> 20:37.937
* It was her awesome
brother--Maximus! *

20:45.978 --> 20:49.282
See you next week.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.384
- I'm so sorry,
Phoebe. I...

20:51.484 --> 20:52.919
When I thought that
you told Max my secret,

20:53.019 --> 20:56.155
I was so hurt, I...
I couldn't even talk to you.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.291
- Link, I would never do that.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.226
You mean so much to me.

21:00.327 --> 21:04.897
Didn't you read my note?
- What note?

21:04.997 --> 21:09.201
- [tiny voice]
This note.

21:09.336 --> 21:10.603
- All right, new rule.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.772
Whenever something doesn't
seem right between us,

21:12.872 --> 21:14.641
we assume Max has
done something terrible.

21:14.741 --> 21:17.109
- [laughing]
Deal.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.612
- BOTH: [laughing]

21:19.712 --> 21:21.213
- JAY JAY:
[clearing throat]

21:21.348 --> 21:23.950
- Okay, let me explain why
we didn't play "Bonus Toe."

21:24.050 --> 21:25.718
It's actually quite touching.

21:25.818 --> 21:28.688
Phoebe and Link--
- You're fired!

21:28.788 --> 21:31.858
- Well, you just missed out
on a really great story.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.361
You would have loved
the part about the bear.

21:38.631 --> 21:42.669
Guys, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get us fired.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.838
- Apologize later
and help us load up.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.274
- Wolfgang swiped
Jay Jay's tube remote.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.277
- Wolfgang is swipin'.

21:51.378 --> 21:54.246
- Hey, get away from that tube!

21:54.381 --> 21:57.684
